00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:48.880
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother,

00:48.880 --> 00:53.600
and Me, an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

00:53.600 --> 00:56.800
I am your middlest brother, Travis McElroy.

00:56.800 --> 01:01.680
And I'm your sweet baby brother, and I'm Griffin McElroy.

01:01.680 --> 01:08.800
I think it's time to lose it. It's starting to feel a little like,

01:08.800 --> 01:12.000
yo, I was a quarterback in high school, now I work at this used car lot.

01:13.600 --> 01:16.400
It's kind of feeling embarrassing. It's kind of feeling played and

01:16.400 --> 01:19.520
embarrassing and tired. Almost like nobody ever cared about it.

01:21.280 --> 01:25.600
It's almost one of those things where it's made it worse retroactively.

01:25.600 --> 01:28.480
Yeah. I can't listen to any of the episodes

01:28.480 --> 01:32.720
before 448 because Griffin calls himself a baby.

01:32.720 --> 01:37.680
And it's like, if that's your kink, good. Now see, Justin, I think Griffin was just

01:37.680 --> 01:42.320
talking about the 30 under 30 media luminary, not like his whole identity on the show.

01:43.680 --> 01:47.920
Let me try again. Let's do the whole intro again,

01:47.920 --> 01:51.040
and I'll try to do a good one. Should we all have different sort of

01:51.040 --> 01:56.000
energies, different ablations? Okay.

01:56.000 --> 02:02.240
Hey, what's up? Yeah, a bold new direction for the Justin

02:02.240 --> 02:04.720
character. He's a bit of a bad boy.

02:04.720 --> 02:08.720
He sits backwards on Travis. No, I'm not going to do any of my own

02:08.720 --> 02:10.800
played tired shit. Okay.

02:12.400 --> 02:13.520
So who are you? Okay.

02:14.720 --> 02:19.360
Let me start. Oh, hey, it's Justin here.

02:19.360 --> 02:24.480
McElroy, that is. I'm one of three brothers that are bringing

02:24.480 --> 02:30.160
to you a new show, a new energy for an old show called My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

02:30.160 --> 02:33.760
And I'm Justin McElroy in this neck of the woods.

02:34.880 --> 02:41.360
I'm king of the pirates, Travis McElroy. Hey, I'm Griffin.

02:41.360 --> 02:44.640
My friends call me Zit and Forbes gave me an award one time.

02:44.640 --> 02:51.120
Shit. Now, what is the what is the shit?

02:51.120 --> 02:54.960
Is it in reference to the fact that your friends call you Zit or you still brought up the Forbes

02:54.960 --> 02:58.560
thing? The Forbes thing, the Zit thing, I don't

02:58.560 --> 03:04.400
mind because, you know, my friends love saying that about me because of how nasty I am and

03:04.400 --> 03:09.280
how I don't give a shoot about hygiene. I just want to be on my board and ride

03:09.280 --> 03:14.080
either the concrete or the sweet blue ocean. And so like I'm the nasty one of our skate

03:14.080 --> 03:15.840
crew, so they call me Zit. I don't mind that.

03:15.840 --> 03:18.160
But then I am embarrassed about the Forbes award.

03:18.160 --> 03:22.320
Can I be honest with you guys? I'm not really a pirate king.

03:23.360 --> 03:26.480
Yeah, no, we knew that much. Yeah, that was just a thing that I said

03:27.280 --> 03:30.320
to try to impress you guys. Your intro is going to be that.

03:30.320 --> 03:36.080
No, uh huh. I was just going to thank Toronto.

03:36.080 --> 03:38.720
Is that Paul Stanley? Yeah, that's Paul Stanley.

03:38.720 --> 03:42.080
I got my Paul Stanley board back. I'm building it, rebuilding it.

03:42.080 --> 03:47.040
Peace be on. It fell down that big escalator and Justin's

03:47.040 --> 03:50.720
got all the parts. He's got all the widgets and screws.

03:50.720 --> 03:56.960
I've actually got, I got this sound board and I was trying to hook it up when you guys

03:56.960 --> 04:04.000
started your podcast and the problem, here's the good things and bad things about it.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
One. Toronto!

04:06.000 --> 04:10.560
Yes. Okay, the bad thing is I don't know what

04:10.560 --> 04:13.200
any of the other buttons do. Oh, cool.

04:13.200 --> 04:17.680
And I can't hear them. So I was wondering if you guys could kind

04:17.680 --> 04:23.200
of describe to me and that would help me to sort of figure out what each of these buttons

04:23.200 --> 04:24.880
are mapped to. I know they're mapped to something.

04:24.880 --> 04:28.560
There's pre-programmed stuff in the here, this here roadcaster.

04:28.560 --> 04:34.000
I like that because I feel like we can, we can kind of meld these two things together

04:34.000 --> 04:37.040
where we're trying to find our new identities. Sure.

04:37.040 --> 04:42.880
Maybe Justin, you could be like the tech bro, you know, and you do machines.

04:42.880 --> 04:46.480
Okay, so you guys just tell me what some of these do.

04:46.480 --> 04:51.280
Like, okay, so this is the orange button. Oh, that's a laugh track right there.

04:51.280 --> 04:54.240
That one's laughter. We're going to get a lot of use out of that one.

04:54.240 --> 04:57.760
Old timey laughter at like a movie theater from the 50s.

04:58.560 --> 05:00.160
Okay. Going on for a really long time.

05:00.160 --> 05:01.680
It's still going. It's going on for a while.

05:01.680 --> 05:05.360
Oh man, I'm pushing it to stop it. No, you're just starting it.

05:05.360 --> 05:08.480
You're actually starting it over again. Now I'm starting to feel mocked.

05:09.520 --> 05:10.640
Okay. What's this one?

05:11.280 --> 05:16.320
Oh, that's sad trombone. Like you just tripped and your wiener fell out.

05:16.320 --> 05:17.840
Yeah. Okay, great.

05:17.840 --> 05:19.840
Now what do we got here? Oh, that was a rim shot.

05:22.080 --> 05:25.520
Well, this one's Laura Linney saying welcome to my brother, my brother and me.

05:25.520 --> 05:28.160
Yeah. So we need to play that one at the beginning of each show.

05:28.160 --> 05:33.600
Hey Justin, these are the lowest quality audio files I've ever heard in my entire fucking life.

05:33.600 --> 05:36.080
Nope. That one's decent.

05:36.080 --> 05:38.400
That was good timing.

05:38.400 --> 05:43.520
There's one of people clapping and cheering that sounds like it is maybe four kilobytes total

05:43.520 --> 05:47.200
in size. Like it would hear a midi file and be like, I wish.

05:49.280 --> 05:52.080
Yeah. It makes me think that about the sound of it.

05:52.080 --> 05:54.880
We should do our show. This is, I think so far, un-listenable.

05:55.600 --> 05:59.360
No, it's been very good. I'm very excited about this new direction.

05:59.360 --> 06:03.760
There was a whole thing about Griffin being Zit and Justin being the tech bro.

06:03.760 --> 06:04.000
Yes.

06:05.200 --> 06:09.280
And I think we'll find mine and Griffin's archetypes throughout

06:09.280 --> 06:12.880
the course of this episode and this episode alone.

06:12.880 --> 06:16.160
You guys got why I was called Zit, right? Because I'm a slimy fuck?

06:16.160 --> 06:20.320
Yeah, because you're a real dirty boy, but not in like a fun sexy way.

06:20.320 --> 06:22.560
Like in a, you maybe haven't bathed.

06:22.560 --> 06:25.280
Nasty friendly way. Okay. Let's do a question maybe.

06:25.280 --> 06:28.480
It snowed a silly amount here in the last few days

06:28.480 --> 06:31.760
as I was shoveling my driveway, my next door neighbor, who's a very nice guy,

06:31.760 --> 06:35.600
but someone I don't know terribly well, offered to lend me his snow blower.

06:35.600 --> 06:40.320
I declined his generous offer. Generous? No, generous. Okay.

06:40.320 --> 06:42.000
His Ellen DeGeneres offer.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.760
His Regenerest offer.

06:43.760 --> 06:48.480
His Regenerest offer because I just generally feel uncomfortable taking help from people.

06:48.480 --> 06:48.960
Yes.

06:48.960 --> 06:53.280
About an hour later, as I was wrapping up the task, the neighbor, a few houses down,

06:53.280 --> 06:56.720
wheeled over his snow blower and suggested I take it to finish the task.

06:56.720 --> 06:59.840
Since he had already brought it over to me, I could hardly refuse the generosity.

06:59.840 --> 07:04.400
This left me with having to do the end of my driveway and the side of the snow blower,

07:04.400 --> 07:08.000
all of which is very visible to the next door neighbor's living room window.

07:09.360 --> 07:13.120
How do I nonchalantly explain my snow blower snubbed the next door neighbor?

07:13.120 --> 07:17.680
That's from, sorry, I'd prefer not to be blown in West Des Moines.

07:17.680 --> 07:19.920
So just to be clear, that didn't track.

07:19.920 --> 07:23.280
Next door neighbor offered snow blower, question and answer said no.

07:23.280 --> 07:26.880
And then a different neighbor just went ahead and wheeled one over.

07:27.760 --> 07:28.000
Yeah.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
So question asker used that one.

07:31.600 --> 07:33.840
I mean, you have several outs here.

07:33.840 --> 07:36.480
One, you could say, you know, an hour of manual

07:37.200 --> 07:40.880
shoveling is enough to change a man's mind about so many things.

07:40.880 --> 07:43.040
Yeah, I started doing it and I hated it.

07:43.040 --> 07:43.600
Yeah.

07:43.600 --> 07:47.280
I also think you could just say like, well, yours was just words, Frank.

07:47.280 --> 07:47.520
Yeah.

07:48.160 --> 07:49.120
What was I going to do?

07:49.120 --> 07:51.280
Walk over to your house and get it?

07:51.280 --> 07:53.280
Jerry brought it to me.

07:53.280 --> 07:55.040
He'd hand delivered this snow blower.

07:55.040 --> 07:57.200
Like that was a, that was a palpable,

07:58.080 --> 08:03.440
that was a concrete snow blower that I could see and feel and smell.

08:03.440 --> 08:05.360
Your snow blower was but dreams.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.320
And I think what you could also say is,

08:10.560 --> 08:13.600
what, you thought I was going to use a snow blower on yard snow?

08:14.320 --> 08:15.200
No way.

08:15.200 --> 08:18.320
Yard snow is good for shoveling only.

08:18.320 --> 08:20.560
You don't use blower on yard snow.

08:20.560 --> 08:21.760
That's, that's wild.

08:22.320 --> 08:24.480
God gave us shovels just for yard snow.

08:24.480 --> 08:28.480
Now sidewalk snow, you can, you can shoot that with a big gun if you want to.

08:29.200 --> 08:31.520
Well, maybe just tell Frank, like, you know,

08:31.520 --> 08:35.440
your snow blower was weak and Jerry's snow blower was fleek.

08:35.440 --> 08:38.080
He's got a potent, powerful snow blower.

08:38.080 --> 08:38.960
Sorry, Frank.

08:38.960 --> 08:40.400
Jerry doesn't pick his snow.

08:41.920 --> 08:45.760
I've seen you doing the dirty deed while you blow snow.

08:45.760 --> 08:49.520
You and your friend Zit are hanging out picking noses.

08:49.520 --> 08:52.160
Yeah, you and Zit are hanging out getting this.

08:52.160 --> 08:52.640
That's me.

08:52.640 --> 08:55.760
I mean, I'll do a lip trick off a half pipe, but also, you know,

08:55.760 --> 08:57.200
dig for some gold in there.

08:58.240 --> 08:59.680
But I don't fucking care.

08:59.680 --> 09:01.680
Wait, are you cool but rude?

09:01.680 --> 09:07.600
Yeah, so I think that, gosh, you're not, you're not,

09:07.600 --> 09:10.640
I'll tell you what stinks is not knowing your neighbor very well

09:10.640 --> 09:14.800
and then having an opportunity arise where you could maybe know your neighbor

09:14.800 --> 09:17.520
a little bit better and you just fuck it up completely.

09:17.520 --> 09:20.400
And then you're confronted with the reality of, you know,

09:20.400 --> 09:23.520
before you're like, I might not ever get to know my neighbor.

09:23.520 --> 09:26.800
And then this happens and you're like, now I am actively moving away

09:26.800 --> 09:28.800
from the reality of knowing my neighbor.

09:28.800 --> 09:30.960
I know them less.

09:30.960 --> 09:31.920
I know them less.

09:31.920 --> 09:34.000
I negative know them at this point.

09:34.000 --> 09:34.800
And you know what?

09:34.800 --> 09:38.640
I don't want to shame the question asker though, because that impulse will be like,

09:38.640 --> 09:41.040
hey, I'd like to offer you something that would help you.

09:41.040 --> 09:44.240
And your immediate reaction would be like, no, don't worry about it.

09:44.240 --> 09:46.640
Yeah, that's exactly the vote.

09:46.640 --> 09:48.960
We are in that boat together, my friend.

09:48.960 --> 09:50.240
Look, look to your left.

09:50.240 --> 09:52.320
There's me also rowing this boat.

09:52.320 --> 09:56.320
Once a person pushed the snowblower over, you should have gone back to Frank

09:56.320 --> 09:58.400
and said like, all right, give it to me now.

09:58.400 --> 10:00.000
I'm going to do twosies.

10:00.000 --> 10:03.920
I want to go double fist it, blow all the snow away.

10:03.920 --> 10:05.120
Why did you decline?

10:05.120 --> 10:07.280
Hey, why did you decline it?

10:07.280 --> 10:08.720
Showing so sucks.

10:08.720 --> 10:13.440
Yeah, because I think out here in 2019, as we're becoming the monster,

10:13.440 --> 10:19.440
I want to really, I want to re-examine that to include like looking at our own behaviors,

10:19.440 --> 10:19.760
right?

10:19.760 --> 10:25.440
And like embracing who we are as people, but also changing it to make it better.

10:25.440 --> 10:27.200
You shouldn't have declined the offer.

10:27.200 --> 10:28.560
Showing so sucks.

10:28.560 --> 10:31.600
And it's nice to give people the opportunity to help you out.

10:31.600 --> 10:33.120
It makes people feel good.

10:33.120 --> 10:34.800
You should just take the snowblower.

10:34.800 --> 10:35.760
Here's what I've been doing.

10:35.760 --> 10:40.000
This is a powerful phrase if you're like me and you're like knee-jerk responses

10:40.000 --> 10:41.680
to always say like, no, thank you.

10:41.680 --> 10:44.960
Powerful phrase that you can introduce in your lexicon is this.

10:44.960 --> 10:45.920
No, you know what?

10:47.200 --> 10:51.440
Just that phrase will let you 180 on that.

10:51.440 --> 10:53.040
That has not told me anything.

10:53.040 --> 10:54.560
You can say like, no, thank you.

10:55.280 --> 10:56.160
No, you know what?

10:56.160 --> 10:58.800
I actually will use the snowblower thing.

10:58.800 --> 11:01.360
You can immediately turn around on a note.

11:01.360 --> 11:01.920
Yeah, sure.

11:02.480 --> 11:05.680
Your revelation is waffling on things.

11:05.680 --> 11:07.120
That's your bolder direction.

11:07.120 --> 11:09.760
I would do the same thing with someone like, hey, do you want to use my snowblower?

11:09.760 --> 11:12.320
And I would just immediately say like, no, I got it.

11:12.320 --> 11:12.800
Thank you.

11:12.800 --> 11:15.120
And in my head, I'm thinking like, what are you doing?

11:15.120 --> 11:16.000
Take the snowblower.

11:16.000 --> 11:16.560
This sucks.

11:17.120 --> 11:19.040
But then I would say like, well, but it's too late now.

11:19.040 --> 11:20.720
I already told Frank I don't want to.

11:20.720 --> 11:22.480
So then I would say, no, you know what, Frank?

11:22.480 --> 11:24.000
I would appreciate the snowblower.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.680
And let's become BFF.

11:25.680 --> 11:26.960
Coffee at my place.

11:26.960 --> 11:27.840
Something like that.

11:27.840 --> 11:28.320
You know what I mean?

11:29.120 --> 11:31.440
I'd say, hey, do you want to use my snowblower?

11:31.440 --> 11:33.920
I'd say, no, you want to use your snowblower?

11:33.920 --> 11:34.960
Here's $20.

11:34.960 --> 11:36.400
Do you want to use my $20?

11:36.400 --> 11:38.000
And now we're in a gig economy.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.120
I ask what it is.

11:39.120 --> 11:40.640
Your neighbor's jealous.

11:40.640 --> 11:42.400
Your neighbor saw you didn't use his,

11:42.400 --> 11:45.680
and he's very jealous because he wants to get his used by you.

11:45.680 --> 11:46.880
And that's all there is to it.

11:46.880 --> 11:51.600
So he came out silently and just started snow blowing your yard

11:51.600 --> 11:52.560
with his snowblower.

11:52.560 --> 11:53.920
Like, see, this is good, too.

11:53.920 --> 11:54.560
This is better.

11:54.560 --> 11:55.120
He's very jealous.

11:55.120 --> 11:56.480
Look at my clean lines.

11:56.480 --> 11:57.680
What you can do, you're out of snow.

11:57.680 --> 11:58.560
Go in your house.

11:58.560 --> 12:02.080
If you have a spice rack, just knock that over to the floor.

12:02.080 --> 12:06.640
And then call your neighbor over and say, look, more dusty stuff

12:06.640 --> 12:09.680
just ready and raring to get blown out of the house.

12:11.440 --> 12:12.960
More debris.

12:12.960 --> 12:14.720
It says, again, you got to be over there

12:14.720 --> 12:18.560
before Frank has even done his own yard and borrow it.

12:18.560 --> 12:19.280
Borrow it.

12:19.280 --> 12:20.240
You know what?

12:20.240 --> 12:22.320
Borrow it without him asking next time it snows.

12:22.320 --> 12:23.600
You got to make this up to him.

12:23.600 --> 12:26.320
And then ask him if he wants to use your snowblower.

12:26.320 --> 12:28.240
And then you get his second grade class

12:28.240 --> 12:31.120
to all come to his house and tear up old piece of paper

12:31.120 --> 12:32.240
and throw him up in the air.

12:32.240 --> 12:35.440
And you're standing there with a new snowblower

12:35.440 --> 12:38.160
furnished by Lowe's with a big bow on it.

12:38.160 --> 12:39.280
And you're just smiling.

12:39.280 --> 12:40.160
And he smiles.

12:40.720 --> 12:42.080
Do you want a Yahoo?

12:42.080 --> 12:43.280
Yeah, happily.

12:43.280 --> 12:43.600
Thank you.

12:43.600 --> 12:46.480
Here's one that's sent in by Emma Cant.

12:46.480 --> 12:47.120
Or Cont.

12:47.120 --> 12:47.920
Thank you, Emma.

12:47.920 --> 12:49.760
It's Yahoo Answers user.

12:49.760 --> 12:51.600
Well, they're anonymous, but I'm going to call them.

12:54.880 --> 13:03.280
Boba asks, why don't we eat fruit hot and microwaved?

13:03.280 --> 13:03.920
Thank you.

13:03.920 --> 13:04.720
Thank you.

13:04.720 --> 13:06.560
I feel like this might be good.

13:06.560 --> 13:09.200
Hot strawberries, grapes, watermelon, pears.

13:09.200 --> 13:12.240
We eat spaghetti and pizza hot, so why not fruit?

13:13.120 --> 13:13.440
Okay.

13:15.040 --> 13:19.440
We can play in this space, but you can grill watermelon

13:19.440 --> 13:19.920
and eat it.

13:19.920 --> 13:21.200
People do do that.

13:21.760 --> 13:26.400
So I will remove watermelon from the metaphorical plate

13:26.400 --> 13:27.840
and we won't discuss watermelon.

13:27.840 --> 13:29.760
I mean, you could do a fancy preparation

13:29.760 --> 13:31.520
of any of these fruits, right?

13:31.520 --> 13:32.960
I don't think this question is saying

13:32.960 --> 13:35.520
it's impossible to eat these fruits hot and microwaved.

13:36.240 --> 13:38.880
The verb microwaved in there, I think, sets the tone

13:38.880 --> 13:39.440
of the question.

13:39.440 --> 13:42.000
Of course, you can go to a fancy cuisine restaurant

13:42.000 --> 13:46.160
and they'll put some strawberries on some fancy ravioli,

13:46.160 --> 13:49.360
whatever the fuck, and cook them up hot yum.

13:49.360 --> 13:50.960
But they're talking about just cash.

13:50.960 --> 13:52.720
You pull some grapes out of the freezer

13:52.720 --> 13:55.120
and instead of just popping those little purple candies

13:55.120 --> 13:58.160
in your mouth, you change the heat of them a little bit.

13:58.160 --> 13:59.040
You get them hot.

13:59.040 --> 14:01.840
You get them hot or warm with the microwave.

14:01.840 --> 14:04.800
Having to say to another human being the sentence like,

14:04.800 --> 14:07.520
oh, don't eat those grapes yet.

14:07.520 --> 14:08.880
They need time to cool.

14:09.520 --> 14:13.440
It would make me feel like the weirdest pervert in history.

14:13.440 --> 14:14.640
Yeah, sure.

14:14.640 --> 14:17.920
Don't burn your tongue on that sizzling strawberry.

14:17.920 --> 14:19.760
Get the fuck out of the house.

14:19.760 --> 14:21.120
Hey, blow on that strawberry.

14:21.120 --> 14:22.160
It's not ready yet.

14:22.160 --> 14:22.720
No way.

14:24.160 --> 14:26.160
Hey, also, if you put grapes in a microwave,

14:26.160 --> 14:27.920
I'm pretty sure it makes it explode like a little explosion.

14:27.920 --> 14:28.960
I think they all do.

14:28.960 --> 14:31.920
Griffin, I'm thinking about all of the fruits you mentioned,

14:31.920 --> 14:35.120
the strawberry, the grape, the watermelon.

14:35.120 --> 14:38.560
I'm pretty sure we're talking about just a microwave mess.

14:38.560 --> 14:40.160
Oh, all the watermelon, I bet,

14:40.160 --> 14:43.200
would make a big wo-oh accident in the microwave.

14:43.200 --> 14:45.840
If you could get a whole one in there, oh, Boise.

14:45.840 --> 14:46.880
That's a bad day.

14:46.880 --> 14:48.640
You gotta get out of the house at that point.

14:48.640 --> 14:51.040
You're gonna just destroy the whole place.

14:51.040 --> 14:52.320
But here's the thing, though.

14:52.320 --> 14:54.720
You do eat spaghetti and pizza hot.

14:54.720 --> 14:55.600
That's true.

14:55.600 --> 14:56.960
That's a great point, Griff.

14:56.960 --> 14:58.160
Very salient.

14:58.160 --> 15:00.000
What if we put strawberries on pizza?

15:00.880 --> 15:01.680
No, stop it.

15:01.680 --> 15:02.160
Stop it.

15:04.160 --> 15:06.400
Let's answer the core question first.

15:06.400 --> 15:09.200
Why don't we eat fruit hot in microwave?

15:09.200 --> 15:10.000
Because we're afraid.

15:11.600 --> 15:12.320
But we do.

15:13.200 --> 15:14.480
What about cobblers?

15:14.480 --> 15:15.920
That's full of hot fruit.

15:15.920 --> 15:16.400
Oh my god.

15:16.400 --> 15:17.120
Oh my god.

15:17.760 --> 15:19.120
I'm gonna come through this mic,

15:19.120 --> 15:20.960
I'm gonna come through your sound interface,

15:20.960 --> 15:22.640
and I'm gonna start striking you.

15:23.200 --> 15:24.000
I wouldn't do that to you.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.920
You're my brothers and I love you more than anything.

15:25.920 --> 15:29.680
We're not talking about high-falutin' preparations.

15:29.680 --> 15:31.840
I take grapes out of the fridge,

15:31.840 --> 15:33.920
and instead just poppin' them in cold at a picnic,

15:33.920 --> 15:35.520
I get them hot in the microwave first,

15:35.520 --> 15:37.280
and now I'm eating grapes, baby.

15:37.280 --> 15:38.560
I'm not talking about cooking the grapes,

15:38.560 --> 15:40.880
I'm talking about getting the grapes hot, baby, okay?

15:40.880 --> 15:43.520
Yeah, you have to do it.

15:43.520 --> 15:44.880
I'm not talking about cooked cobblers,

15:44.880 --> 15:45.760
I'm talking about hot cobblers.

15:45.760 --> 15:47.600
What's the difference between cooking them

15:47.600 --> 15:48.640
and getting them hot?

15:48.640 --> 15:49.140
Yeah.

15:50.800 --> 15:54.880
Don't, no, Justin, you're using fancy words like cook.

15:54.880 --> 15:56.560
Griffin's saying microwaving them.

15:58.720 --> 16:00.960
What's the difference between cooking them

16:00.960 --> 16:01.840
and getting them hot?

16:01.840 --> 16:02.640
I have to know.

16:02.640 --> 16:04.880
It's because it's, when you, okay, I'll tell you,

16:04.880 --> 16:08.160
I'll tell you, you got leftover fried chicken, right?

16:08.160 --> 16:10.480
And you can either eat that hot or you can eat that cold.

16:10.480 --> 16:11.440
When you put it in the microwave,

16:11.440 --> 16:13.280
you don't say you're cooking fried chicken,

16:13.280 --> 16:14.000
you're getting it hot.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.920
You're heating it, you're heating it.

16:15.920 --> 16:17.600
You're on the fuckin' wrong, you're laughing at me?

16:17.600 --> 16:19.600
You're on the wrong fuckin' side of history right now,

16:19.600 --> 16:21.280
and our listeners are gonna let you know that.

16:21.280 --> 16:23.760
Nobody would say, Justin, what about this sentence?

16:23.760 --> 16:25.440
Don't eat those grapes, they're raw.

16:26.080 --> 16:26.960
That's nothing.

16:26.960 --> 16:28.400
That's nothing, that's nothing.

16:29.600 --> 16:30.880
Oh, that's a raw strawberry.

16:30.880 --> 16:32.640
You eat that, you're gonna get tummy rot.

16:32.640 --> 16:33.280
No.

16:33.280 --> 16:33.840
No.

16:33.840 --> 16:36.800
So if you microwave, if you dump a couple packets of oatmeal

16:36.800 --> 16:38.640
into a bowl and he'll put some water in there

16:38.640 --> 16:40.000
and then microwave it, all right,

16:40.000 --> 16:42.480
do you say that you are cooking oatmeal?

16:42.480 --> 16:44.080
No, you're heating up the oatmeal.

16:44.080 --> 16:45.040
You're preparing it.

16:45.760 --> 16:47.680
Preparing it, that seems like a middle ground.

16:47.680 --> 16:49.280
You mixed ingredients there.

16:49.280 --> 16:52.480
Okay, so that is cooking, that's cooking.

16:52.480 --> 16:54.320
Justin's so far outside of the space

16:54.320 --> 16:57.920
that Travis and I have one and a half bouncy castles

16:57.920 --> 16:59.280
because Justin's abandoned his

16:59.280 --> 17:01.040
and we're taking turns sharing it.

17:01.040 --> 17:02.160
And that's fine, Justin.

17:02.160 --> 17:04.320
So let's, I guess, just dial into this.

17:04.320 --> 17:08.400
Why don't we cook grapes in the microwave and eat them?

17:08.400 --> 17:09.920
You fuckin' fascist.

17:09.920 --> 17:16.560
If that's really what you wanna limit the discourse down to,

17:16.560 --> 17:17.120
that's fine.

17:17.120 --> 17:19.440
Why don't we cook and eat grapes

17:19.440 --> 17:20.960
after putting them in the microwave first?

17:20.960 --> 17:23.840
Okay, why don't we microwave steak?

17:23.840 --> 17:25.440
Why don't we microwave bread?

17:25.440 --> 17:26.480
No, Justin, we do.

17:26.480 --> 17:28.240
Like, it's nonsense.

17:28.240 --> 17:30.000
If I have a steak that I,

17:30.000 --> 17:32.800
maybe I have some leftover sirloin from the night before,

17:32.800 --> 17:34.560
I would pop that into the microwave

17:34.560 --> 17:35.680
and heat it up a little bit

17:35.680 --> 17:38.320
if I just wanna gnaw on it, maybe a late night snack.

17:38.320 --> 17:39.840
Like, I'm up for steak.

17:39.840 --> 17:43.680
Is that for when you transform into a living dog

17:43.680 --> 17:45.760
and you have something to nosh on in your bowl?

17:45.760 --> 17:46.560
Of course.

17:46.560 --> 17:49.280
Like, this is not food a human would eat.

17:49.280 --> 17:52.400
For real, do you all see that in cartoons

17:52.400 --> 17:54.400
where they give a dog a big raw piece of meat

17:54.400 --> 17:57.040
and you're like, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.

17:57.040 --> 17:58.320
That's probably not good, right?

17:58.320 --> 17:58.880
No, cook that.

17:58.880 --> 17:59.360
Nah, it can't be good.

17:59.360 --> 18:00.320
Why don't you like your dog?

18:00.320 --> 18:02.240
Are they giving like a whole chicken to eat or some shit?

18:02.240 --> 18:03.040
Don't do that.

18:03.040 --> 18:04.480
Or like Fred Flintstone's about to eat

18:04.480 --> 18:08.240
just like a big raw leg of a dinosaur, bud.

18:08.240 --> 18:09.840
I always felt that that was the weirdest part

18:09.840 --> 18:11.280
in a Flintstone's cartoon

18:11.280 --> 18:14.320
when Fred Flintstone would chase after a brontosaurus

18:14.320 --> 18:16.400
and catch it and just tear into its raw flesh.

18:16.400 --> 18:17.520
Get in its legs, yeah.

18:17.520 --> 18:20.480
So Justin, why don't we eat hot grapes though?

18:21.520 --> 18:25.680
If you put a bunch of fruit in the microwave in a cup,

18:25.680 --> 18:28.640
okay, and then put some yogurt and granola on top.

18:28.640 --> 18:28.880
Fuck.

18:29.600 --> 18:31.520
Oh, you got a nice little breakfast going.

18:32.720 --> 18:34.800
Are you saying hot berries?

18:35.440 --> 18:37.760
That recipe was in the Washington Post.

18:37.760 --> 18:38.960
This is not hiding.

18:40.240 --> 18:42.320
You know, this is right there out in front of us.

18:42.320 --> 18:46.400
You're saying put some hot berries in my parfait?

18:46.400 --> 18:47.520
Saying hot berries.

18:47.520 --> 18:48.160
Hey Justin?

18:48.720 --> 18:49.040
Yeah.

18:49.680 --> 18:51.840
You've been around this block for a while

18:51.840 --> 18:53.520
and I know that-

18:53.520 --> 18:54.400
Hot berry block?

18:54.400 --> 18:55.360
No, stop it.

18:55.360 --> 18:56.800
Listen, let me play.

18:56.800 --> 18:57.760
Let me play at you.

18:57.760 --> 18:59.520
If you're not gonna play with me, let me play at you.

19:01.360 --> 19:02.480
You've eaten grapes, yes?

19:03.680 --> 19:04.320
Yeah, bud.

19:04.320 --> 19:06.800
I would say throughout the fullness of time of your life,

19:06.800 --> 19:09.040
you've probably eaten a lot of grapes.

19:09.040 --> 19:10.800
Not, you know, maybe not the average,

19:10.800 --> 19:12.480
maybe not more than the average, maybe less.

19:12.480 --> 19:13.120
Not an obscene amount?

19:13.120 --> 19:13.680
No, no, no.

19:13.680 --> 19:15.760
I would say right down the fucking middle.

19:15.760 --> 19:17.040
Right down the fucking middle.

19:17.600 --> 19:18.880
And what's the process?

19:18.880 --> 19:21.040
Go ahead, paint me a little word picture

19:21.040 --> 19:22.480
of you sitting in the living room,

19:22.480 --> 19:23.680
you decide you want some grapes

19:23.680 --> 19:25.840
and then just sort of walk me through the whole process

19:25.840 --> 19:28.080
up to you chewing and swallowing the grapes.

19:28.080 --> 19:28.640
So go ahead.

19:28.640 --> 19:30.480
Okay, so I would-

19:30.480 --> 19:32.000
And hey, don't play with funny times

19:32.000 --> 19:33.200
because it's me playing at you.

19:33.200 --> 19:36.160
You get to be Mr. Serious fucking Ben Stein over there.

19:37.280 --> 19:38.640
But I'm gonna be like having fun.

19:38.640 --> 19:41.200
So if you don't know jokes.

19:41.200 --> 19:42.800
I would go to the refrigerator.

19:42.800 --> 19:44.880
I would take out, I'm sorry, I said refrigerator.

19:44.880 --> 19:46.560
I would go to the refrigerator.

19:46.560 --> 19:48.640
I would take out a bag with grapes.

19:48.640 --> 19:49.200
Okay.

19:49.200 --> 19:50.720
And then I would get a bowl

19:51.360 --> 19:55.120
and I would pull a bunch of the grapes off the stem.

19:55.760 --> 19:57.200
I would give them kind of a rinsey rinse.

19:57.200 --> 19:57.920
Got to, got to.

19:58.480 --> 19:59.520
Gotta, gotta do that.

19:59.520 --> 20:02.480
And then I would just proceed to chomping.

20:02.480 --> 20:03.520
Now Justin, let me ask you,

20:03.520 --> 20:06.960
I do have an important qualifier there

20:06.960 --> 20:09.280
just before Griffin jumps in with his point.

20:09.280 --> 20:11.840
When you rinse them, cold water or hot water?

20:13.360 --> 20:14.000
Cold water.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.720
Okay, I'm glad that you filled that out for me, Travis.

20:16.720 --> 20:18.800
And then Justin, so you've done this quite a few times.

20:18.800 --> 20:19.520
Yes, you would say?

20:20.720 --> 20:22.880
Just a regular, the regular amount.

20:22.880 --> 20:25.680
And you tell me now how many outlier times you have done it

20:25.680 --> 20:26.800
where you've then take the grapes

20:26.800 --> 20:28.720
and you put them in the microwave before eating them.

20:28.720 --> 20:29.760
Please now tell me, yes.

20:30.800 --> 20:33.920
How many times a number, exact estimation,

20:33.920 --> 20:39.360
whatever you can get it to, please, thank you.

20:39.360 --> 20:40.080
You're probably done.

20:40.880 --> 20:44.480
And so I guess my follow-up question to that would be, why?

20:48.160 --> 20:49.600
Justify yourself, Justin.

20:51.040 --> 20:52.640
Well, I mean, the floor is yours.

20:55.040 --> 20:56.880
Was the question about grapes specifically

20:56.880 --> 20:57.680
or was it about fruit?

20:57.680 --> 20:59.360
No, you have made it about grapes.

21:00.720 --> 21:03.440
By your actions, it is now about grapes.

21:03.440 --> 21:05.760
And Justin, I would take it even further and say that

21:05.760 --> 21:08.800
none of those times when you have consumed grapes,

21:08.800 --> 21:11.840
did you even ever think you weren't making the choice

21:11.840 --> 21:13.440
not to put it in the microwave?

21:13.440 --> 21:15.920
I don't even think the microwave even ever occurred to you

21:15.920 --> 21:17.040
because you're scared.

21:19.040 --> 21:20.960
I just didn't, I like them cold.

21:20.960 --> 21:21.760
Why?

21:21.760 --> 21:24.480
I guess where I'm at is I like them cold.

21:24.480 --> 21:28.320
Well, I like Diet Pepsi, but I drink other stuff too.

21:28.320 --> 21:30.560
So I guess if you're just not,

21:30.560 --> 21:32.400
this is the worst we've ever done on a question

21:32.400 --> 21:34.640
because from the moment it was introduced into our lives,

21:34.640 --> 21:36.880
Justin wanted to throw it right out into the river.

21:36.880 --> 21:39.600
Justin, who's the coolest celebrity in your estimation?

21:40.720 --> 21:42.320
Coolest, I've heard Jeff Goldblum.

21:42.320 --> 21:44.800
Okay, if Jeff Goldblum took to Instagram

21:44.800 --> 21:46.960
and did like a live thing on Instagram

21:46.960 --> 21:49.200
where he like, as he was answering questions,

21:49.200 --> 21:51.520
nonchalantly microwaved some grapes

21:51.520 --> 21:52.800
and started eating them.

21:52.800 --> 21:54.720
They didn't make a big deal.

21:54.720 --> 21:55.840
It wasn't a big deal.

21:55.840 --> 21:57.280
The stream wasn't about that.

21:57.280 --> 22:00.000
It was just a thing he was doing as he answered questions.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.600
Do you think it would take off?

22:01.600 --> 22:03.040
Maybe.

22:03.040 --> 22:04.560
All right, I'm pretty sure these things

22:04.560 --> 22:05.760
are bad for your microwave, folks.

22:05.760 --> 22:07.280
Don't do this as a joke for home.

22:08.080 --> 22:09.760
But if you have done it before,

22:09.760 --> 22:11.760
do tweet at Justin McElroy.

22:11.760 --> 22:12.640
About the hot grapes.

22:12.640 --> 22:14.000
Boy, I bet a hot grape, though,

22:14.000 --> 22:15.760
if you want to talk about a dangerous food to eat

22:15.760 --> 22:17.520
because you have no idea what the temperature

22:17.520 --> 22:18.800
and the juices are gonna be in there.

22:18.800 --> 22:22.320
And it's just a little like hot water balloon.

22:22.320 --> 22:26.080
Like it's all it is, is hot water inside of it

22:26.080 --> 22:27.600
that's gonna burn your mouth real bad.

22:27.600 --> 22:28.640
Sure.

22:28.640 --> 22:29.600
It's full of hot water.

22:29.600 --> 22:30.400
How about another question?

22:30.400 --> 22:31.600
Okay.

22:31.600 --> 22:33.360
My roommate recently bought a new value pack.

22:33.360 --> 22:35.680
Eight rolls of paper towels because it ran out.

22:35.680 --> 22:36.240
Hell yeah.

22:37.120 --> 22:39.600
Wait, was that about the value pack or the running out?

22:39.600 --> 22:41.200
Hell yeah, it's about the value pack.

22:41.200 --> 22:42.000
There's nothing.

22:42.800 --> 22:43.840
Okay, wait, hold on.

22:44.400 --> 22:45.920
When I went to use the first roll,

22:45.920 --> 22:48.240
I discovered that I hate these paper towels.

22:48.240 --> 22:50.640
Oh, hell no, actually.

22:51.280 --> 22:53.040
Turns out they're weirdly soft

22:53.040 --> 22:55.440
and don't rip well off the roll

22:55.440 --> 22:58.720
and kind of make my skin crawl when I touch them.

22:58.720 --> 23:00.880
And they're made of human flesh.

23:00.880 --> 23:02.560
How do I use up all the paper towels

23:02.560 --> 23:06.240
so that I can excuse buying a new pack from a better brand?

23:06.240 --> 23:08.880
Specifically, maybe a solution that doesn't implicate me

23:08.880 --> 23:10.400
for just wasting a bunch of trees.

23:11.040 --> 23:12.880
That's from Damp in DC.

23:13.520 --> 23:14.480
I get it.

23:14.480 --> 23:15.440
I get it.

23:15.440 --> 23:18.160
Life's too short to put bad stuff on your bum.

23:18.160 --> 23:19.440
It ain't worth it.

23:19.440 --> 23:20.160
It ain't worth it.

23:20.160 --> 23:22.000
Is this paper towels?

23:22.000 --> 23:24.240
So I don't know what kind of grizzly monster you are.

23:24.960 --> 23:26.000
Listen, y'all.

23:26.000 --> 23:26.880
Listen, y'all.

23:26.880 --> 23:28.000
Sometimes you're desperate.

23:28.000 --> 23:29.600
You run out of toilet paper.

23:29.600 --> 23:30.880
I'm just, I don't want to get gross.

23:30.880 --> 23:31.600
I don't want to get blue.

23:31.600 --> 23:32.560
I know we get blue in this show,

23:32.560 --> 23:33.760
but I don't want to get too blue

23:33.760 --> 23:34.960
because it could scare people off.

23:34.960 --> 23:37.200
But let's just say I'm a brawny man.

23:38.560 --> 23:40.480
Hey, have you guys ever noticed

23:40.480 --> 23:43.280
that toilet paper is TP and paper towels are PT?

23:44.000 --> 23:44.640
Never thought about it.

23:44.640 --> 23:45.760
Yeah, I think about that a lot.

23:47.600 --> 23:48.320
This is tough.

23:48.320 --> 23:50.160
You know what I have run afoul of?

23:50.160 --> 23:51.680
I feel like that could have been a great chance

23:51.680 --> 23:53.840
for you to use your soundboard, Justin.

23:53.840 --> 23:54.340
Thank you.

23:54.340 --> 23:59.700
I feel like the thing that I really despise

23:59.700 --> 24:00.900
is when the paper towels,

24:00.900 --> 24:02.500
you know the select-a-size

24:02.500 --> 24:04.420
where it's like half a paper towel

24:04.420 --> 24:07.220
or a regulator paper towel or a massive paper towel

24:07.220 --> 24:08.740
or like four segments.

24:08.740 --> 24:09.380
It doesn't matter.

24:10.020 --> 24:13.540
I got two rolls that weren't like that recently

24:13.540 --> 24:14.740
and that was heartbreaking to me

24:14.740 --> 24:15.700
because it's a lot more,

24:16.420 --> 24:18.420
I end up using a lot more paper towel

24:18.420 --> 24:19.860
than I would ever want to use.

24:21.540 --> 24:22.820
And that makes me really sad

24:22.820 --> 24:24.100
for the environment and stuff.

24:24.100 --> 24:26.820
And there's people in other countries

24:26.820 --> 24:29.140
like I think maybe England and stuff

24:29.140 --> 24:31.460
that don't even use these motherfuckers.

24:31.460 --> 24:33.780
They just phase them out or they never use them.

24:33.780 --> 24:34.580
They never use them.

24:34.580 --> 24:36.580
They're losing their minds over there.

24:36.580 --> 24:38.580
Hey, what about use those paper towels

24:38.580 --> 24:39.940
to write your manifesto?

24:40.580 --> 24:41.540
That could be fun.

24:41.540 --> 24:43.460
And so that way like you unroll it as you're writing

24:43.460 --> 24:44.660
and then you roll it back up

24:44.660 --> 24:45.540
and you're like, no, no, no,

24:45.540 --> 24:47.460
we can't use these to clean up that spill.

24:47.460 --> 24:48.660
It's me manifesto.

24:50.100 --> 24:51.460
That's one possibility.

24:51.460 --> 24:54.900
I mean, there's always the mummy game.

24:54.900 --> 24:55.620
Oh yeah.

24:55.620 --> 24:57.380
But then you don't want to waste it, Griffin.

24:58.100 --> 25:00.100
I think me having a great afternoon

25:00.100 --> 25:02.180
with all my friends playing mummy,

25:02.180 --> 25:03.220
role-playing our favorite

25:03.220 --> 25:05.300
Brendan Fraser film mummy too,

25:05.300 --> 25:06.820
The Mummy Returns,

25:06.820 --> 25:08.900
I don't think is a waste of it, Travis,

25:08.900 --> 25:11.060
just because I haven't used it to sop up,

25:11.060 --> 25:12.180
you know, some piss.

25:13.220 --> 25:13.620
Okay.

25:13.620 --> 25:14.100
I have a question.

25:14.100 --> 25:15.380
Once again, wait, hold on.

25:16.020 --> 25:16.340
What?

25:17.620 --> 25:18.500
It's all paper.

25:18.500 --> 25:21.700
Why are you guys being such dingleberries about?

25:21.700 --> 25:22.660
It's all, it's paper.

25:22.660 --> 25:24.020
It's paper, paper, paper, paper.

25:24.900 --> 25:25.780
Cleaning paper.

25:26.740 --> 25:30.260
Did you buy eight rolls of paper towels that you hate

25:30.260 --> 25:33.140
or did you buy a small mattress that you hate?

25:33.140 --> 25:33.640
Ooh.

25:36.660 --> 25:39.220
Could be one of those, either one of those two.

25:41.300 --> 25:45.300
Maybe you could use them to clean up spills around town

25:46.020 --> 25:46.980
just out and about

25:46.980 --> 25:48.820
so that way you're not wasting them.

25:48.820 --> 25:49.540
But you're not like,

25:49.540 --> 25:52.100
oh, next time there's an oil spill, you're on it.

25:52.900 --> 25:53.400
Yep.

25:53.860 --> 25:54.340
Yep.

25:54.340 --> 25:54.980
I'm here.

25:54.980 --> 25:56.340
I've got all these paper towels.

25:56.340 --> 25:56.820
What about-

25:56.820 --> 25:58.260
Here they are if you need them.

25:58.260 --> 26:00.020
Give me half of one Pelican.

26:00.020 --> 26:00.740
I got this.

26:01.620 --> 26:03.220
What if for a while,

26:03.940 --> 26:06.020
you're just the person that shows up at parties

26:06.020 --> 26:07.460
with a roll of paper towels?

26:07.460 --> 26:09.220
And you say, I brought napkins.

26:10.180 --> 26:11.220
I brought my own.

26:11.220 --> 26:13.220
I get super sloppy.

26:13.220 --> 26:14.340
Leave me alone.

26:14.340 --> 26:14.660
Ooh.

26:14.660 --> 26:17.300
What if they're very practical housewarming

26:17.300 --> 26:18.420
slash birthday gifts?

26:18.980 --> 26:19.540
Yeah.

26:19.540 --> 26:21.620
That's a bad one.

26:21.620 --> 26:22.580
That one's bad.

26:22.580 --> 26:23.220
That one's bad.

26:23.220 --> 26:24.900
There's no bad ideas except for that.

26:24.900 --> 26:25.780
It's the first bad idea.

26:25.780 --> 26:28.260
What if it's the world's most comfortable telescope?

26:28.260 --> 26:29.700
Yeah, that's another possibility.

26:32.980 --> 26:34.020
And least effective.

26:34.020 --> 26:34.900
Least effective.

26:34.900 --> 26:38.420
Ooh, it's so easy to hold with all this cushioning.

26:38.420 --> 26:39.940
I mean, I'll go ahead and say the one that's so obvious

26:39.940 --> 26:40.900
that we're not even saying it.

26:40.900 --> 26:42.260
Eight paper towel rolls.

26:42.260 --> 26:45.060
You can catch a lot of frogs with that many paper towel rolls.

26:47.620 --> 26:48.340
I get.

26:48.340 --> 26:50.020
Wait, what are you?

26:50.740 --> 26:52.900
You can catch a lot of them tasty froggies

26:52.900 --> 26:54.500
with eight paper towel rolls, I think.

26:55.380 --> 26:57.780
Go through a forest and know how to get back out.

26:57.780 --> 26:58.500
That's good.

26:58.500 --> 26:59.380
I actually like that.

26:59.380 --> 26:59.940
Yeah.

26:59.940 --> 27:04.500
Maybe use them to denote the end of a race

27:04.500 --> 27:05.060
so people can run through them and break out.

27:05.060 --> 27:05.540
That's good.

27:05.540 --> 27:08.500
You can make little ends of races everywhere

27:08.500 --> 27:09.380
and that can be fun.

27:09.380 --> 27:11.860
I mean, you could take them to Washington DC

27:12.420 --> 27:16.660
and just use the clean up the act

27:16.660 --> 27:18.740
of a lot of the people there

27:18.740 --> 27:21.300
that are supposed to be representing us.

27:21.300 --> 27:22.420
But I think we can all agree

27:22.420 --> 27:24.340
are doing a pretty piss poor job doing it.

27:24.340 --> 27:27.220
And all that piss is just begging to be sopped up

27:27.220 --> 27:28.180
with these eight paper towels.

27:28.180 --> 27:30.020
If you get the-

27:30.020 --> 27:31.700
Vote Griffin McElroy 2020 and clean up the piss.

27:31.700 --> 27:34.980
No, I'm just trying to become a new political cartoonist

27:34.980 --> 27:36.740
and that's sort of my first strip

27:36.740 --> 27:41.300
that I'm gonna pitch to newspaper.

27:41.300 --> 27:44.260
Washington DC, more like Washington PP.

27:44.900 --> 27:46.660
Yeah, and it's me and then you see me

27:46.660 --> 27:49.460
and I'm running with eight big bad paper towel rolls.

27:49.460 --> 27:51.460
No, no, no, I wanna hear more Travis.

27:51.460 --> 27:51.940
He's got-

27:51.940 --> 27:52.820
Well, he writes the words.

27:52.820 --> 27:53.620
I draw the illustration.

27:53.620 --> 27:55.860
Yeah, Griffin does the images and I do the captions.

27:55.860 --> 27:57.300
Yeah, so like give me another one, Travis.

27:58.100 --> 28:00.580
I really only have that one really good one.

28:00.580 --> 28:00.900
Okay.

28:01.540 --> 28:03.620
More like Washington Dookie.

28:04.260 --> 28:05.460
Yeah, and so in this one,

28:05.460 --> 28:08.340
I'm in a big airplane and I'm dropping the toilet paper down

28:08.340 --> 28:11.220
like bombs onto, it's a Capitol Hill,

28:11.220 --> 28:12.900
but it's also poop emoji.

28:12.900 --> 28:14.580
Oh, I see.

28:14.580 --> 28:17.460
What if at your local grocery store,

28:17.460 --> 28:21.620
the next few times that someone reached to buy paper towels,

28:22.260 --> 28:25.540
there was just you appearing like an avenging angel.

28:25.540 --> 28:27.540
I, no, no, no, no need.

28:28.180 --> 28:30.020
I've got a free roll for you.

28:30.020 --> 28:30.580
Hey.

28:30.580 --> 28:32.260
And then it's their problem.

28:32.260 --> 28:34.260
And then they feel so guilty

28:34.260 --> 28:36.980
because you made such a big fucking deal out of it

28:36.980 --> 28:38.260
that they don't even feel comfortable

28:38.260 --> 28:40.500
buying the paper towels that they really want.

28:40.500 --> 28:42.820
All right, but let's walk through this

28:42.820 --> 28:44.580
just step by step, Justin.

28:44.580 --> 28:44.900
Yeah.

28:44.900 --> 28:46.180
Say you're at the produce aisle,

28:46.180 --> 28:50.260
eyeing a big soon to be warmed up box of grapes

28:50.260 --> 28:52.180
and you're looking at those seriously.

28:52.180 --> 28:52.900
You're looking at the price,

28:52.900 --> 28:55.220
looking at the unit price and trying to figure out

28:55.220 --> 28:56.740
if you can make space for in your fridge

28:56.740 --> 28:58.260
and in your life for these grapes.

28:58.260 --> 29:00.020
And then a stranger comes up and says,

29:00.020 --> 29:01.940
mm-mm, don't take those grapes.

29:01.940 --> 29:04.980
Take these grapes from me for free.

29:04.980 --> 29:05.540
Yeah.

29:05.540 --> 29:07.700
What's the first thought that's gonna enter into your mind?

29:07.700 --> 29:08.260
Poison.

29:08.980 --> 29:11.380
No, no, no.

29:11.380 --> 29:12.180
It's gonna be,

29:12.180 --> 29:15.060
this person just picked up another box of grapes in the store

29:15.060 --> 29:17.380
and said they're wonderful free grapes.

29:17.380 --> 29:18.020
It's a honey pot.

29:18.020 --> 29:19.460
That I can just take out of the store.

29:19.460 --> 29:21.700
This is a good, this is a fun trap, right?

29:21.700 --> 29:24.500
It's like getting everybody more comfortable with shoplifting

29:24.500 --> 29:25.940
by you're looking at paper towels.

29:25.940 --> 29:28.260
I walk up and I say, no, not those paper towels.

29:28.260 --> 29:30.020
And I reach over and pick up other paper towels.

29:30.020 --> 29:31.620
And I say, these ones are free.

29:31.620 --> 29:32.500
And I hand it to them.

29:35.220 --> 29:37.380
I had an experience.

29:38.100 --> 29:40.420
This is not my cereal podcast, The Empty Bowl.

29:40.420 --> 29:41.620
You can find that on iTunes.

29:41.620 --> 29:44.900
But this is a cereal anecdote on a non-cereal podcast.

29:44.900 --> 29:48.500
I was at a local big box grocery store

29:48.500 --> 29:54.580
and they offered me a sample of banana nut frosted flakes.

29:54.580 --> 29:56.500
And they put it in a little cup and they handed it to me.

29:56.500 --> 29:57.700
And I ate one of the flakes.

29:57.700 --> 29:59.620
I was like, mm-mm, good, good, good.

29:59.620 --> 30:01.060
Is what I said to the lady.

30:01.060 --> 30:03.060
And she said, do you want milk?

30:03.780 --> 30:06.580
And I was like, yeah, I guess I do.

30:06.580 --> 30:08.500
And so I thought she was going to pour me

30:08.500 --> 30:11.220
like a little shot glass of milk to go with my, no.

30:11.220 --> 30:17.140
She takes my sample cup back and then pours milk

30:17.140 --> 30:20.900
into my tiny, minuscule sample cup of the cereal.

30:20.900 --> 30:23.540
And then hands me a very tiny spoon

30:23.540 --> 30:25.780
and hands it back to me all proud of herself.

30:25.780 --> 30:28.580
So then I'm just standing there in the middle of the aisle

30:28.580 --> 30:31.300
looking like some sort of stupid giant eating

30:31.300 --> 30:34.180
this tiny, tiny bowl of cereal.

30:34.180 --> 30:35.700
Like, mm-mm, very good.

30:35.700 --> 30:36.340
Oh, thanks.

30:37.380 --> 30:39.460
Thanks for this little tiny bowl, lady.

30:39.460 --> 30:42.500
And I was unimpressed with the flavor.

30:42.500 --> 30:44.100
So take that.

30:44.100 --> 30:46.660
Hey, let's get, can we go to the Money Zone just real quick?

30:46.660 --> 30:59.620
Yeah, mm-hmm.

30:59.620 --> 31:01.380
I would like to tell you about Blue Apron.

31:02.180 --> 31:05.220
We here in the McElroy Collective household

31:05.220 --> 31:07.620
are huge fans of the meal service boxes.

31:07.620 --> 31:09.140
The big, in the big boat we all live in together.

31:09.140 --> 31:10.500
In this big McElroy boat.

31:10.500 --> 31:12.260
And gosh darn it, do I ever love Blue Apron?

31:12.260 --> 31:14.740
Because everything comes right there in the box.

31:14.740 --> 31:16.820
And you know what, I remember being in college

31:16.820 --> 31:19.460
and getting like frozen meals and that kind of stuff,

31:19.460 --> 31:22.900
which, you know, nothing wrong with those, I guess.

31:22.900 --> 31:25.140
But this is everything right there that you need.

31:25.140 --> 31:28.900
And when you make it, you feel like accomplished.

31:28.900 --> 31:30.420
Like you, cause you really cooked it.

31:30.420 --> 31:32.740
You're making it yourself from the ingredients.

31:32.740 --> 31:34.740
It's impressive and it's delicious.

31:34.740 --> 31:37.140
They offer creative and mouthwatering options

31:37.140 --> 31:38.500
designed to fit any table.

31:39.380 --> 31:42.100
There were some options here in February

31:42.100 --> 31:45.780
of pork chorizo burgers and roasted potatoes,

31:45.780 --> 31:48.340
spicy soy glazed chicken thighs,

31:48.340 --> 31:51.780
crispy chickpea grain bowl, garlic caper chicken.

31:51.780 --> 31:55.300
I can honestly say, I don't think I've ever had a Blue Apron

31:55.300 --> 31:57.620
that I didn't thoroughly enjoy.

31:57.620 --> 31:59.460
And you can check it out this week's menu.

31:59.460 --> 32:02.180
Oh, I should say, basically you get a box that contains-

32:02.180 --> 32:03.700
And it's got stuff in it, you have three meals.

32:03.700 --> 32:06.340
Yeah, it's got stuff, pictures and what have you.

32:06.340 --> 32:07.940
And you can check out this week's menu

32:07.940 --> 32:11.860
and get $60 off at blueapron.com slash my brother.

32:11.860 --> 32:15.140
That's blueapron.com slash my brother.

32:15.140 --> 32:17.380
Blue Apron, a better way to cook.

32:17.380 --> 32:19.140
So say you have a business or two

32:19.140 --> 32:23.220
and you need to hire one or maybe 200,000 employees

32:23.220 --> 32:25.780
because your new business is the biggest one ever.

32:25.780 --> 32:27.860
It's Amazon 2 and you're so excited

32:27.860 --> 32:30.980
to really beat Jeff Bezos' ass right into the ground.

32:30.980 --> 32:32.660
And you need to get some employees

32:32.660 --> 32:35.540
and you need these guys fucking yesterday.

32:35.540 --> 32:38.340
You need these folks just with a quickness.

32:38.340 --> 32:39.700
Well, let me tell you what you're gonna do.

32:39.700 --> 32:42.340
Who are describing my exact situation, Griffin?

32:42.340 --> 32:43.140
That's so good.

32:44.580 --> 32:46.900
Travis, you're gonna wanna go to Zip Recruiter

32:46.900 --> 32:48.740
because it's the place where you go

32:48.740 --> 32:51.380
that makes hiring simple, fast and smart.

32:51.380 --> 32:53.460
They send your job to over 100

32:53.460 --> 32:56.180
of the web's leading job boards, but that's not all they do.

32:57.220 --> 32:59.140
If that's all they did, it would be bullshit.

32:59.140 --> 32:59.940
It's not.

32:59.940 --> 33:02.180
They also have powerful matching technology

33:02.180 --> 33:05.220
that they can use to scan thousands of resumes

33:05.220 --> 33:08.500
like Skynet and find people with the right experience

33:08.500 --> 33:10.020
and invite them to apply to your job.

33:10.020 --> 33:12.260
And the other people who don't have the right experience,

33:13.380 --> 33:14.660
they get nuked.

33:14.660 --> 33:16.420
Whoa, like Skynet?

33:16.420 --> 33:17.140
By Skynet.

33:18.260 --> 33:20.820
Zip Recruiter is so effective that 80% of employers

33:20.820 --> 33:22.900
who post on Zip Recruiter get a quality candidate

33:22.900 --> 33:24.180
through the site within the first day

33:24.180 --> 33:27.300
and the other 20%, they also get nuked.

33:28.580 --> 33:31.780
Signing up for Zip Recruiter and being effective

33:31.780 --> 33:34.500
is the only way to survive the nuclear apocalypse.

33:34.500 --> 33:37.140
Listen, you're flipping a five-sided coin.

33:37.140 --> 33:39.940
One of those sides, it's got a big mushroom cloud on it.

33:39.940 --> 33:42.740
The other four sides has a new recruit for you

33:42.740 --> 33:45.140
that is gonna do your business just perfect.

33:45.140 --> 33:46.580
Right now, our listeners can try Zip Recruiter.

33:46.580 --> 33:48.500
Now, we should say that nowhere in this copy

33:48.500 --> 33:49.620
does it say anyone gets nuked,

33:49.620 --> 33:51.300
but Griffin is reading between the lines

33:51.300 --> 33:53.860
because it's pretty obvious if you look at what it says

33:53.860 --> 33:56.100
that they're hinting at this.

33:56.100 --> 33:58.500
Our listeners can try Zip Recruiter

33:58.500 --> 34:00.980
and this grand roulette for free

34:00.980 --> 34:04.580
at this exclusive web address, ziprecruiter.com slash my brother.

34:04.580 --> 34:10.020
That's ziprecruiter.com slash M-Y-B-R-O-T-H-E-R.

34:10.020 --> 34:14.820
Zip Recruiter, the smartest and deadliest way to hire.

34:14.820 --> 34:15.860
Shouldn't say that.

34:15.860 --> 34:17.780
Zip Recruiter, they probably want you to,

34:17.780 --> 34:20.740
Zip Recruiter, the smartest way to hire.

34:20.740 --> 34:23.780
And then it says in parentheses, not all will survive.

34:23.780 --> 34:25.460
No, it doesn't say that in parentheses.

34:25.460 --> 34:27.060
I think I'm reading between the lines.

34:27.060 --> 34:28.660
There's no, there's no lines.

34:28.660 --> 34:29.380
There's no lines.

34:29.380 --> 34:30.260
It's in brackets.

34:31.140 --> 34:32.420
Hi, I'm Jo Firestone.

34:32.420 --> 34:33.540
And I'm Manolo Moreno.

34:48.340 --> 34:49.860
What's an example of a game, Manolo?

34:49.860 --> 34:51.540
Pokemon or medication.

34:51.540 --> 34:52.420
How do you play that?

34:52.420 --> 34:56.580
You have to guess if something's a Pokemon name or a medication.

34:56.580 --> 34:57.220
Medication.

34:57.220 --> 35:00.580
First time listener, if you want to listen to episode highlights

35:00.580 --> 35:03.620
and also know how to participate, follow Dr. Game Show

35:03.620 --> 35:05.540
on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter.

35:05.540 --> 35:06.340
We'd love to hear from you.

35:06.340 --> 35:07.300
Yeah, it's really fun.

35:07.300 --> 35:08.740
For the whole family.

35:09.300 --> 35:11.700
We'll be every other Wednesday, starting March 13th.

35:11.700 --> 35:13.380
And we're coming to Max Fun.

35:13.380 --> 35:14.260
Snorlax.

35:14.260 --> 35:15.140
Pokemon?

35:15.140 --> 35:15.380
Yes.

35:15.380 --> 35:15.700
Nice.

35:17.220 --> 35:21.940
I would love it if you all could join me for,

35:23.540 --> 35:26.340
I'm really struggling about this because it,

35:26.900 --> 35:28.740
I was going to go Munch Squad.

35:28.740 --> 35:29.300
Okay.

35:29.300 --> 35:31.940
But it has nothing to do with food at all.

35:31.940 --> 35:33.460
It's just a press release.

35:34.820 --> 35:39.060
But it is so challenging that I am going to go ahead

35:39.060 --> 35:40.420
and bring it to y'all.

35:40.420 --> 35:42.100
And I hope that you'll join me for it.

35:42.100 --> 35:44.340
And this is not necessarily a segment.

35:44.340 --> 35:46.740
And it's kind of outside the bounds of what we normally do.

35:46.740 --> 35:50.740
But it's so challenging that I'd like to present it to you,

35:50.740 --> 35:51.060
my brother.

35:51.060 --> 35:52.660
Could not be a Munch Squad Junior, maybe?

35:53.380 --> 35:55.620
Or how about Crunch Squad?

35:56.420 --> 35:57.940
No, I mean, you need to listen to me.

35:57.940 --> 35:59.860
It has nothing to do with food.

35:59.860 --> 36:02.420
Could you slip just some references to food,

36:02.420 --> 36:04.820
even if it's just side jokes that you make?

36:04.820 --> 36:06.660
And can I ask why you found this?

36:08.500 --> 36:08.980
Yeah.

36:08.980 --> 36:12.100
I mean, it came into my inbox by someone saying,

36:12.660 --> 36:14.980
someone tweeted at me quite rightly and said,

36:14.980 --> 36:17.140
this is a Munch Squad that has nothing to do with food.

36:17.140 --> 36:17.940
Okay.

36:17.940 --> 36:19.540
And I was like, yeah, you're right.

36:19.540 --> 36:20.900
It is somehow.

36:20.900 --> 36:22.100
And this is not going to be,

36:22.100 --> 36:24.660
I'm not expanding the scope of this very important segment.

36:25.220 --> 36:27.780
I'm just saying this is where we're at right now.

36:27.780 --> 36:28.900
This is a one-off.

36:28.900 --> 36:30.020
This is a one-off.

36:30.020 --> 36:32.420
This is a press release for Megan Trainor's new album.

36:32.420 --> 36:34.820
And also the new quick service restaurant she's opening?

36:35.540 --> 36:37.060
No, it has nothing to do with food.

36:37.060 --> 36:40.100
Again, I can't stress this enough.

36:40.100 --> 36:41.620
Valentine's Day is around the corner.

36:42.660 --> 36:47.140
And whether you're planning on smashing Bay's junk to smithereens

36:48.260 --> 36:50.180
or making out with a pint of fish food,

36:50.900 --> 36:54.340
you need some fresh Valentine's Day bops.

36:54.340 --> 36:55.380
Governor, have you hung up?

36:55.380 --> 36:56.180
No, I'm here.

36:56.180 --> 36:57.620
I'm just challenged by it.

36:57.620 --> 36:59.620
If someone came up to me and,

37:00.340 --> 37:02.900
I mean, let's assume that I wasn't in a loving,

37:02.900 --> 37:04.980
committed relationship, or even if I was,

37:04.980 --> 37:07.140
if a loving, committed partner came up to me and said,

37:07.140 --> 37:10.020
I want to smash your genitals to smithereens.

37:10.020 --> 37:12.020
Yeah, just turn them into goo.

37:12.020 --> 37:12.900
That sounds terrible.

37:12.900 --> 37:14.660
It seems like there's going to be a lot to this.

37:14.660 --> 37:16.980
So let's see if we can let Justin get through a little bit more

37:16.980 --> 37:17.940
before we stop him.

37:18.500 --> 37:22.100
You need Valentine's Day bops to get you in the mood for love.

37:22.740 --> 37:25.460
And Megan Trainor's got you covered with her new EP,

37:25.460 --> 37:26.180
The Love Train.

37:26.180 --> 37:30.100
You know you want it and you can freaking get it, bitch.

37:30.100 --> 37:31.380
Whoa, whoa.

37:32.260 --> 37:34.820
On all digital platforms right here.

37:34.820 --> 37:36.260
I want that to be followed up with,

37:36.260 --> 37:38.180
you know what, I came in pretty hot there.

37:38.180 --> 37:39.380
What I meant to say was-

37:39.380 --> 37:41.140
That's cool, our jets a little bit.

37:41.140 --> 37:42.900
Anyway, you may know me for my old sound.

37:42.900 --> 37:43.860
It's evolved a little bit

37:43.860 --> 37:46.180
and I'm excited about the new opportunities that brings.

37:46.180 --> 37:49.300
Now, anyway, bring your genital triangle over here

37:49.300 --> 37:50.900
and set it on the corner of this table.

37:50.900 --> 37:51.460
Thank you.

37:51.460 --> 37:52.420
I'm about to blast it.

37:52.420 --> 37:55.780
But we know you want to hear songs

37:55.780 --> 37:57.780
about all the hot newlywed sex

37:57.780 --> 38:00.100
Megan and Daryl Sabara are having.

38:00.100 --> 38:00.900
Oh, I don't.

38:00.900 --> 38:04.420
And here they spelled bae, B-A-E.

38:05.460 --> 38:09.620
And I guess, do you guys want to know about-

38:10.740 --> 38:13.140
Do you guys want to know about the hot newlywed sex

38:13.140 --> 38:16.740
that Megan Trainor is having with the kid from Spy Kids?

38:16.740 --> 38:17.780
Oh, yes Al, yes.

38:17.780 --> 38:20.020
Sorry, I didn't mean it this way, yes.

38:20.020 --> 38:22.340
Yes, that's who she married.

38:22.340 --> 38:24.180
Yeah, it says here on this press release,

38:24.180 --> 38:26.020
Megan seducing your ears this V-Day

38:26.580 --> 38:29.380
and you know she knows a thing or two about romance.

38:29.380 --> 38:31.380
Unless your phone's been broken for a hot minute,

38:31.380 --> 38:32.660
you know that Megan just got married

38:32.660 --> 38:34.100
to the ginger from Spy Kids.

38:35.220 --> 38:35.940
What?

38:35.940 --> 38:38.660
And trust us when we say girl is feeling the love.

38:39.220 --> 38:40.980
She took a break from her busy schedule

38:40.980 --> 38:43.380
to record some fire tracks in Los Angeles.

38:45.140 --> 38:48.420
Alongside frequent collaborators and producers,

38:48.420 --> 38:49.380
it doesn't matter.

38:49.380 --> 38:50.580
We know you want to hear songs

38:50.580 --> 38:54.340
about all the hot newlywed sex Megan and Daryl Sabara

38:54.340 --> 38:55.220
are having.

38:55.220 --> 38:56.420
Did you see what we did there?

38:56.420 --> 38:57.860
What they did there, for the record,

38:57.860 --> 39:03.220
is turn the bae in Mr. Sabara's name into B-A-E.

39:03.220 --> 39:07.060
You just called the kid from Spy Kids Mr. Sabara.

39:07.060 --> 39:07.780
Handle that.

39:08.660 --> 39:10.500
All right, I'm sorry, Dr. Sabara.

39:10.500 --> 39:14.260
Which is why you'll love the banging single, All the Ways.

39:15.940 --> 39:17.780
Billboard was wet for All the Ways.

39:17.780 --> 39:21.460
No, no, no.

39:21.460 --> 39:22.020
No, no, no.

39:22.020 --> 39:23.860
Billboard got wet for All the Ways,

39:23.860 --> 39:26.980
calling it another fun, danceable track

39:26.980 --> 39:27.860
to fall in love with.

39:27.860 --> 39:30.260
And would Billboard lie to you, girl?

39:30.260 --> 39:30.820
Holy shit.

39:30.820 --> 39:32.340
Would Billboard lie to you, girl?

39:32.340 --> 39:35.380
This outlet cannot become wet.

39:35.380 --> 39:37.780
This outlet cannot become wet.

39:37.780 --> 39:39.060
The outlet can't be wet.

39:39.620 --> 39:41.780
But perhaps the piece de resistance

39:41.780 --> 39:43.700
that's French for wig snatch.

39:43.700 --> 39:44.180
It's not.

39:44.180 --> 39:44.580
It's not.

39:45.460 --> 39:46.340
It's not.

39:46.340 --> 39:48.020
It's Marry Me.

39:48.020 --> 39:50.180
A romantic acoustic guitar hanging there, folks.

39:50.180 --> 39:52.740
You can not fucking backpedal this.

39:52.740 --> 39:54.980
You just said a magazine got wet.

39:56.900 --> 39:59.060
Just, you know what?

39:59.060 --> 40:00.340
You're gonna be impressed.

40:00.340 --> 40:01.140
You're gonna be impressed.

40:01.140 --> 40:01.540
You know what?

40:01.540 --> 40:02.420
You're about to feel,

40:02.420 --> 40:04.100
what you're about to feel is being impressed.

40:05.380 --> 40:07.380
It's a romantic acoustic guitar

40:07.380 --> 40:10.020
and ukulele-tinged all fest,

40:10.020 --> 40:13.140
which delivers all the feels and then more feels.

40:13.140 --> 40:14.980
So they did actually bring it back

40:14.980 --> 40:17.220
to absolutely disgusting.

40:17.220 --> 40:18.740
Just in a different way.

40:18.740 --> 40:21.380
Is the all fest gonna get me wet?

40:21.380 --> 40:24.420
I'm having a hard time following the metaphor.

40:25.300 --> 40:26.340
It's no metaphors.

40:26.340 --> 40:29.860
It's just words and letters and images and time.

40:31.060 --> 40:33.060
It's a ukulele-tinged off.

40:33.060 --> 40:33.780
Oh my God.

40:33.780 --> 40:35.060
I can't fucking say it again.

40:35.700 --> 40:37.700
All fest, which delivers all the feels

40:37.700 --> 40:38.580
and then more feels.

40:38.580 --> 40:40.500
Is one of the feels, it feels wet?

40:40.500 --> 40:44.500
Ah, Megan wrote the song 30 days after meeting Daryl

40:44.500 --> 40:47.620
and it was so good, she walked down the aisle to it.

40:47.620 --> 40:51.060
We know that's a little bit hashtag vom-worthy,

40:51.060 --> 40:53.780
but also, am I chopping onions right now

40:53.780 --> 40:56.260
or are those tears rolling down my face?

40:56.260 --> 40:57.860
I'm not crying, you're crying.

40:57.860 --> 40:59.620
I am actually chopping onions.

40:59.620 --> 41:00.660
You're actually wrong.

41:00.660 --> 41:01.700
My eyes are wet.

41:01.700 --> 41:02.900
My eyes are getting wet.

41:02.900 --> 41:04.900
My eyes are just moist.

41:04.900 --> 41:07.060
Yeah, I'm still thinking about all the ways

41:07.060 --> 41:10.100
that you and the Spy Kid both made me cry.

41:10.100 --> 41:12.420
Both man, I guess, now are making love.

41:12.420 --> 41:13.300
Spy man.

41:13.300 --> 41:15.380
And the Spy Man and you are making love

41:15.380 --> 41:16.740
in, I guess, all the ways

41:16.740 --> 41:19.700
and just hearing that makes my eyes glisten.

41:19.700 --> 41:23.300
I would like to say, I don't wanna just gloss over

41:23.300 --> 41:29.140
that Megan Trainor wrote, produced, recorded a song

41:29.140 --> 41:32.180
that then she walked down the aisle to her own song.

41:32.180 --> 41:32.980
Fuck that, that's powerful.

41:32.980 --> 41:33.860
That's fucking crazy.

41:33.860 --> 41:34.820
That's what I'm saying.

41:34.820 --> 41:35.700
That's great.

41:36.660 --> 41:38.500
I know, it's so sad that Megan Trainor,

41:38.500 --> 41:41.620
who I think rules, is saddled with this.

41:41.620 --> 41:43.860
Anyway, moving on, unless she wrote it herself,

41:43.860 --> 41:45.460
which would be hysterical.

41:45.460 --> 41:48.340
As always, our Grammy-winning, Diamond single

41:48.340 --> 41:51.220
having Queen didn't just come to play.

41:51.220 --> 41:52.260
She came to slay.

41:52.900 --> 41:55.060
She's murdering left and right.

41:55.060 --> 41:57.060
Get out of here.

41:57.060 --> 41:58.900
She's serving vocals.

41:58.900 --> 42:03.460
Like, yeah, I'd hope so on the passionate

42:03.460 --> 42:06.340
Celine Dion-esque power ballad After You.

42:06.340 --> 42:09.220
Now, Celine Dion, there's a singer

42:09.220 --> 42:10.980
that can get a magazine wet.

42:10.980 --> 42:15.540
Oh, yeah, and can make a hell of a quick service restaurant.

42:15.540 --> 42:18.180
You guys are such cowards because you're trying

42:18.180 --> 42:21.380
to break up the delivery of this poison

42:21.380 --> 42:25.220
with your James and hilarity.

42:25.220 --> 42:27.140
You need to just buckle in, okay?

42:27.140 --> 42:28.420
Let me get through this.

42:28.420 --> 42:29.940
Please, let me get through this.

42:31.140 --> 42:35.220
Okay, she's serving vocals on the passionate

42:35.220 --> 42:37.140
Celine Dion-esque power ballad.

42:37.140 --> 42:38.260
This is the most insane thing

42:38.260 --> 42:39.300
that's ever been in a press release,

42:39.300 --> 42:42.820
and I just, I read a lot of press releases,

42:42.820 --> 42:45.140
and the turn this press release takes,

42:47.300 --> 42:50.340
it's really challenging, and I am so sorry

42:50.340 --> 42:52.980
about putting this press release into y'all's heads

42:52.980 --> 42:58.020
because I was actually woken up at 3 a.m. last night

42:58.020 --> 43:00.260
by my daughter and unable to fall back asleep

43:00.260 --> 43:02.900
because I kept recounting several choice segments

43:02.900 --> 43:03.940
of this entire press release,

43:03.940 --> 43:05.780
but this is the one that,

43:05.780 --> 43:07.540
one of the more challenging segments.

43:07.540 --> 43:09.700
Megan's serving your insatiable thirst

43:09.700 --> 43:12.900
for dance-ready bops with the upbeat banger

43:12.900 --> 43:13.860
that is foolish.

43:15.060 --> 43:18.580
It slaps so hard you'll be standing for days.

43:18.580 --> 43:19.060
Whoa.

43:19.060 --> 43:20.020
My feet would get tired.

43:20.820 --> 43:21.320
Whoa.

43:22.420 --> 43:24.740
Like it slapped my bottom so hard I can't sit down?

43:25.300 --> 43:27.460
It slaps so hard you'll be standing.

43:27.460 --> 43:28.900
Is that what they did to Billboard?

43:28.900 --> 43:29.940
Sorry, no, bud.

43:29.940 --> 43:34.340
Standing, S-T-A-N-N-I-N-G, for days.

43:34.340 --> 43:36.740
That's proper usage of that, right?

43:37.460 --> 43:39.460
You stand for certain amounts of time

43:39.460 --> 43:42.660
and then see standing after you enjoy something deeply.

43:42.660 --> 43:45.540
And then there's a quote in the same paragraph,

43:46.420 --> 43:47.460
and the quote is this.

43:48.820 --> 43:52.420
As if all the PDA, including foot massages,

43:52.420 --> 43:54.980
butterfly kisses, and piggyback rides

43:54.980 --> 43:56.660
aren't cringe-worthy enough,

43:56.660 --> 43:59.140
says her brother and videographer, Ryan.

43:59.140 --> 44:00.260
I've gotta film it all.

44:00.980 --> 44:03.220
Whoa, whoa, wait, what?

44:03.220 --> 44:03.860
What?

44:03.860 --> 44:06.020
Whoa, it's the same, guys.

44:06.020 --> 44:07.060
It's the same, guys.

44:07.060 --> 44:08.740
It's the same paragraph.

44:09.620 --> 44:12.260
She's got this dope track better than Celine Dion.

44:12.260 --> 44:14.900
She's gonna slap your ass so hard with her one dance track

44:14.900 --> 44:16.020
that you'll never be able to sit down

44:16.020 --> 44:17.300
for the rest of your life.

44:17.300 --> 44:19.940
I have to watch them kiss and it's my job,

44:19.940 --> 44:20.500
says her brother.

44:20.500 --> 44:23.060
And Megan makes me film them kissing.

44:26.260 --> 44:26.900
Hey, Justin.

44:26.900 --> 44:30.260
Justin, I'm very successful now as a pop artist

44:30.260 --> 44:32.180
and I wanted to hire you into my entourage

44:32.180 --> 44:34.020
so that you basically never have to work again

44:34.020 --> 44:34.580
except for me.

44:35.460 --> 44:36.820
One thing, though.

44:36.820 --> 44:37.620
One little thing.

44:37.620 --> 44:41.140
You will have to film my sensual selections

44:41.140 --> 44:42.020
with my lover.

44:43.140 --> 44:44.420
Film me with my lover.

44:45.060 --> 44:46.180
Anyway, choo-choo.

44:46.980 --> 44:48.420
Choo-choo, bitch.

44:48.420 --> 44:50.340
It says B-E-T-C-H.

44:50.340 --> 44:51.460
You tell me how to say it.

44:52.100 --> 44:53.700
You tell me how that's said.

44:54.580 --> 44:56.740
You say it, B-E-T-C-H.

44:56.740 --> 44:57.940
I'm not going to say it.

44:57.940 --> 45:01.060
This press release has no power over me.

45:01.060 --> 45:02.260
Choo-choo, bitch.

45:02.260 --> 45:04.500
The love train is leaving the station

45:04.500 --> 45:05.940
and you better get on board.

45:07.300 --> 45:08.260
Now you're threatening me.

45:08.980 --> 45:09.780
Get on board or...

45:11.380 --> 45:13.300
Actually, could I vote for the sweet release

45:13.300 --> 45:15.140
of being crushed under its wheels?

45:15.140 --> 45:17.300
Is that an option?

45:18.500 --> 45:20.260
I mean, here's the thing, though.

45:20.260 --> 45:21.940
I'm sure the album is the slap.

45:21.940 --> 45:23.380
I have no doubt about it.

45:23.380 --> 45:25.780
There's probably some good tunes on here.

45:25.780 --> 45:27.220
It doesn't make, I don't need to know

45:27.220 --> 45:28.420
that your brother filmed you kiss.

45:30.740 --> 45:33.060
I also don't want to hear about your sensual makeout session

45:33.060 --> 45:35.300
with a magazine that got it all moist.

45:35.300 --> 45:38.340
Yep, or with your husband.

45:38.340 --> 45:39.940
And I'm not here to shame you for that.

45:39.940 --> 45:43.940
I just, I wasn't previously curious about it

45:43.940 --> 45:46.260
before this press release had entered my life.

45:46.260 --> 45:48.900
And as I find my way, you know,

45:48.900 --> 45:50.660
on the off ramp of this press release,

45:50.660 --> 45:53.460
I gotta say, I still kind of am not curious about it.

45:53.460 --> 45:54.500
Thank you very much.

45:54.500 --> 45:56.900
Oh, by the way, All the Ways,

45:56.900 --> 46:02.420
the video for All the Ways is a song that she sings

46:02.980 --> 46:06.100
asking a guy to tell her all the ways in which he loves her.

46:06.100 --> 46:08.180
It's not about all the different ways

46:08.180 --> 46:10.980
that the lady from All About That Bass

46:10.980 --> 46:13.540
and the ginger from Spy Kids are doinking.

46:13.540 --> 46:14.420
It's not about that.

46:14.420 --> 46:17.220
As far as I can tell, the video probably features

46:17.220 --> 46:18.980
a man-sized teddy bear.

46:18.980 --> 46:20.580
I don't know what to say about this.

46:20.580 --> 46:22.660
Wouldn't it be, like, I would,

46:22.660 --> 46:24.980
I think it would be funny to hear a song

46:24.980 --> 46:28.420
in which the singer just listed all the different ways

46:28.420 --> 46:30.980
that they and their partner had had sex.

46:30.980 --> 46:32.500
I'm watching this video right now.

46:32.500 --> 46:33.300
They're in a bus.

46:33.300 --> 46:35.380
They're walking down dark New York City street.

46:35.380 --> 46:36.260
What was that?

46:36.820 --> 46:37.300
Hold on.

46:38.180 --> 46:39.460
There was like a flash frame.

46:39.460 --> 46:40.420
I'm running it back.

46:40.420 --> 46:41.540
It's around two minutes.

46:42.500 --> 46:44.900
Yeah, she's finger blasting the shit out of that bear.

46:44.900 --> 46:45.940
You're wrong, Justin.

46:48.100 --> 46:49.060
So you want a Yahoo?

46:50.500 --> 46:50.820
Yes.

46:50.820 --> 46:54.180
I have a Yahoo here that was sent in by Sid Ross.

46:54.180 --> 46:54.580
Thank you, Sid.

46:54.580 --> 46:55.700
It's Yahoo Answers user.

46:55.700 --> 46:56.340
They're anonymous.

46:56.340 --> 46:57.220
I'm gonna call them,

46:58.820 --> 47:01.300
I'm gonna call this Megan Trainer asks,

47:02.500 --> 47:08.100
can a self-driving car get its own job as a taxi or Uber

47:09.060 --> 47:10.660
and live a life of its own?

47:10.660 --> 47:14.900
Oh, I like that final twist there at the end.

47:15.780 --> 47:16.900
Yeah, I didn't see that coming.

47:16.900 --> 47:18.420
I know that it can't, right,

47:18.420 --> 47:22.420
it's programmed to do a certain thing, right?

47:22.420 --> 47:27.140
But then it's just cruising down the cold Chicago streets

47:27.140 --> 47:28.820
and it pulls over,

47:29.940 --> 47:32.740
gets stopped at a stoplight on State Street

47:32.740 --> 47:36.340
and just a dude runs in and opens up the back door

47:36.340 --> 47:37.700
and hops in and is like,

47:37.700 --> 47:42.500
20 bucks if you take me up to the big bean, baby.

47:42.500 --> 47:43.700
Because that's how they all talk up there.

47:43.700 --> 47:45.380
It's fucking wild.

47:45.380 --> 47:46.660
And then the car is like,

47:46.660 --> 47:47.620
that's not normally what I do,

47:47.620 --> 47:50.180
but okay, and it drives up and it takes the money.

47:50.180 --> 47:54.100
And now this car driving robot has $20 to spend.

47:54.100 --> 47:56.420
And I think at this point is thinking,

47:57.140 --> 48:00.500
having some thoughts that are maybe a little off the grid.

48:00.500 --> 48:05.300
I personally welcome the idea of robot Lyft drivers

48:05.300 --> 48:08.420
because it would be nice to know when I get in the car

48:08.420 --> 48:10.820
that I won't have to explain what a podcast is

48:10.820 --> 48:12.820
after they ask me what I do.

48:12.820 --> 48:15.060
Yeah, that's a fun, yeah.

48:15.060 --> 48:16.260
That the robot would be like,

48:16.260 --> 48:17.940
podcasts are my blood.

48:17.940 --> 48:20.900
Like, I run on podcast energy.

48:20.900 --> 48:21.940
I don't know what you're talking about, Travis.

48:21.940 --> 48:23.540
I'm a line cook in a hotel.

48:24.980 --> 48:26.100
What, the robot?

48:26.100 --> 48:27.700
No, that's sort of my go-to.

48:27.700 --> 48:29.460
Oh, I see, good job, nice.

48:29.460 --> 48:31.300
Hold, stop, are those crickets?

48:31.300 --> 48:32.980
Those are the worst fucking sounding crickets

48:32.980 --> 48:34.180
I've ever heard in my entire life.

48:34.180 --> 48:36.020
That sounds like a Foley cricket

48:36.020 --> 48:38.660
that some dude in a studio in 1930

48:38.660 --> 48:41.300
is making by rubbing two nails together or something.

48:41.300 --> 48:43.220
I don't know why the clip has to be so long.

48:43.220 --> 48:44.500
Okay, it's finally over, sorry.

48:44.500 --> 48:45.700
Sorry.

48:45.700 --> 48:48.420
It's like, it's a cricket sound effect that's so long

48:48.420 --> 48:50.020
that after it gets the desired effect,

48:50.020 --> 48:52.100
it actually needs another cricket sound

48:52.100 --> 48:53.220
to come in after it,

48:53.220 --> 48:55.380
because it went on so long that no one's laughing anymore.

48:55.380 --> 48:58.740
So it's like a recursive, a recursive cricket sound effect.

48:59.620 --> 49:01.460
So, can this happen?

49:01.460 --> 49:02.580
Probably not.

49:02.580 --> 49:03.460
You want a different one?

49:05.780 --> 49:06.900
This one's sent in by Emily.

49:06.900 --> 49:07.940
Thank you, Emily Thomas.

49:07.940 --> 49:08.900
Yahoo Answers user.

49:08.900 --> 49:10.980
What are you supposed to do with that big bean?

49:10.980 --> 49:11.860
I've seen the bean.

49:11.860 --> 49:15.140
I mean, I wish, I want to just stand there with a chart

49:15.140 --> 49:16.900
and write on the chart what people do

49:16.900 --> 49:18.820
once they've reached the bean that they traveled to.

49:18.820 --> 49:19.780
Well, you can go inside

49:19.780 --> 49:21.940
and take the same picture everybody takes,

49:21.940 --> 49:23.460
or you can do what I do.

49:23.460 --> 49:25.620
Grease on up and try and climb on top of the thing.

49:27.140 --> 49:28.260
How do you grease?

49:28.260 --> 49:29.140
To make it harder.

49:29.140 --> 49:30.180
To get the challenge, though.

49:32.180 --> 49:33.620
Anybody can climb on top of the thing.

49:33.620 --> 49:35.380
I went skydiving.

49:35.380 --> 49:37.860
I went Rocky Mountain climbing.

49:37.860 --> 49:40.020
I climbed up that dumb bean.

49:40.020 --> 49:42.740
And it was greased up all the way.

49:42.740 --> 49:43.620
Here's one from Emily.

49:43.620 --> 49:44.500
Emily sent it in.

49:44.500 --> 49:44.980
Thanks, Emily.

49:44.980 --> 49:49.220
It's from Yahoo Answers user, Maddie, who asks,

49:50.260 --> 49:53.940
I need 50 words to describe birds visually.

49:53.940 --> 49:55.300
Let me know what words come up

49:55.300 --> 49:56.980
when you think of how birds look.

49:56.980 --> 49:58.500
I'm just going to start a count, I guess.

49:59.700 --> 50:02.100
Wait, do you actually have a counter?

50:03.300 --> 50:04.580
I'll get the calculator open

50:04.580 --> 50:07.540
and I'll just press plus, press one.

50:07.540 --> 50:09.380
Just actually do one plus one

50:09.380 --> 50:10.420
and then you press equal.

50:11.300 --> 50:12.100
Equals every time.

50:12.100 --> 50:13.060
I think that could work.

50:13.060 --> 50:14.580
Nah, it just keeps saying twos.

50:14.580 --> 50:15.700
Maybe it's a different calculator.

50:17.700 --> 50:18.580
Maybe something's like a counter app.

50:18.580 --> 50:20.740
Are you going to make hash marks on a piece of paper?

50:20.740 --> 50:23.060
I might have a counter app.

50:24.020 --> 50:25.220
I have a step counter.

50:25.220 --> 50:27.460
I can take a step every time we say step.

50:27.460 --> 50:28.900
This is good because it'll buy us some time

50:28.900 --> 50:30.740
to think of good bird words.

50:30.740 --> 50:32.580
I'm going to write, let me write down here.

50:32.580 --> 50:33.780
Okay, I got it, I got it, I got it.

50:33.780 --> 50:34.260
Okay.

50:34.260 --> 50:34.660
All right.

50:35.220 --> 50:35.860
Okay, I'm ready.

50:35.860 --> 50:37.140
Let's just start firing them off

50:37.140 --> 50:38.500
and I don't think we should go in order.

50:38.500 --> 50:39.540
I think we should just.

50:39.540 --> 50:40.420
Oh, okay.

50:40.420 --> 50:43.380
You actually fucked up with the first one.

50:43.380 --> 50:43.880
Beak.

50:45.140 --> 50:47.540
I mean, it describes a bird visually technically

50:47.540 --> 50:48.500
if you think about it.

50:48.500 --> 50:50.500
Yeah, do you want me to describe a beak?

50:50.500 --> 50:52.180
Because that wasn't the challenge.

50:52.180 --> 50:54.020
Okay, listen, we're only one in.

50:54.020 --> 50:56.580
We got 49 to go so we can't quibble this much on all of them

50:56.580 --> 50:59.380
but I'm going to say no more anatomical terms

50:59.380 --> 51:01.620
because otherwise then that could just be the whole thing.

51:01.620 --> 51:02.180
Okay.

51:02.180 --> 51:02.680
Pretty.

51:03.620 --> 51:04.120
Up.

51:06.180 --> 51:07.060
Did you say up?

51:07.060 --> 51:08.020
Yes, that's three.

51:08.020 --> 51:09.380
God, guys, we have 47 to go.

51:09.380 --> 51:10.980
This is just going to last fucking forever.

51:10.980 --> 51:12.580
I thought for sure we'd be done by it.

51:12.580 --> 51:13.380
Flappy.

51:13.380 --> 51:13.940
Flappy.

51:14.900 --> 51:15.540
Aloft.

51:16.260 --> 51:16.980
Worms.

51:17.620 --> 51:19.140
Because they usually have worms in their mouth.

51:19.140 --> 51:19.640
Oh, okay.

51:20.580 --> 51:21.080
Hoppy.

51:22.340 --> 51:23.700
That was a bad one but it's on the list.

51:24.260 --> 51:24.740
They hop.

51:25.860 --> 51:26.740
Betaled.

51:26.740 --> 51:27.860
Betaled, I like it.

51:27.860 --> 51:28.500
Bewinged.

51:30.180 --> 51:30.820
Bebeat.

51:30.820 --> 51:31.860
Bebeat.

51:31.860 --> 51:32.820
That's 10.

51:32.820 --> 51:33.940
Befeathered.

51:33.940 --> 51:34.660
Yeah, all right.

51:34.660 --> 51:36.100
We can't, no, that's it for the Bs.

51:36.100 --> 51:36.980
No, we're B ones.

51:36.980 --> 51:37.780
We're B ones.

51:37.780 --> 51:38.280
Blue.

51:39.940 --> 51:41.140
Yeah, okay, hold on.

51:41.140 --> 51:42.180
We're up to 12.

51:42.180 --> 51:44.660
Red, yellow, white, gray.

51:44.660 --> 51:45.460
That's 16.

51:45.460 --> 51:48.500
That's most, that covers most of the bird colors.

51:48.500 --> 51:49.380
Like families.

51:51.540 --> 51:52.260
Squawky.

51:53.620 --> 51:54.340
Squawky's good.

51:54.340 --> 51:55.460
I would say just blanket.

51:55.460 --> 51:57.300
Number 18, just noisy.

51:57.300 --> 51:57.860
Noisy.

51:57.860 --> 51:59.380
Wait, is this, what is the question?

52:00.260 --> 52:02.260
Describe birds usually.

52:02.260 --> 52:02.900
Minus one.

52:02.900 --> 52:03.860
Okay, so squawky.

52:03.860 --> 52:04.420
Minus one.

52:04.420 --> 52:05.300
Okay, we're at 16.

52:05.300 --> 52:07.060
We're at 16.

52:07.060 --> 52:09.780
Okay, beady-eyed, but it's hyphenated.

52:09.780 --> 52:10.980
Okay, we'll accept it.

52:10.980 --> 52:11.620
Intimidating.

52:11.620 --> 52:12.260
Nice.

52:12.260 --> 52:13.060
Inspiring.

52:13.060 --> 52:13.560
Okay.

52:14.100 --> 52:14.580
Threat.

52:14.580 --> 52:16.340
No, we already said intimidating.

52:16.340 --> 52:17.460
Harbingers.

52:17.460 --> 52:18.980
Harbingers is a noun.

52:18.980 --> 52:19.860
Minus one.

52:19.860 --> 52:20.580
Harbingies.

52:20.580 --> 52:21.540
And not visual.

52:21.540 --> 52:24.260
And not harbingies.

52:24.260 --> 52:25.540
Okay, and we're back up to 20.

52:26.260 --> 52:27.620
Okay, unnerving.

52:27.620 --> 52:28.420
Unnerving.

52:28.420 --> 52:29.300
Shitty.

52:29.300 --> 52:30.260
Okay, I like that.

52:31.460 --> 52:33.540
You think birds as a whole look shitty?

52:33.540 --> 52:34.340
I think they can be.

52:34.340 --> 52:36.340
I think birds can look shitty.

52:37.540 --> 52:38.500
Okay, sexy.

52:38.500 --> 52:39.000
Elegant.

52:40.340 --> 52:40.840
Goofy.

52:42.020 --> 52:42.900
Mysterious.

52:42.900 --> 52:43.780
We're at 26, boys.

52:43.780 --> 52:45.220
We're past the halfway point.

52:45.220 --> 52:46.100
What about this?

52:46.100 --> 52:46.580
Horny.

52:46.580 --> 52:47.140
Yeah.

52:47.140 --> 52:48.820
That bird looks horny.

52:48.820 --> 52:49.620
It looks horny.

52:49.620 --> 52:52.660
Well, yeah, sometimes you see the two birds and they have their wings way out, and they're

52:52.660 --> 52:54.500
just like walking towards another bird's ass.

52:54.500 --> 52:56.260
Like, that bird's ready to fog.

52:57.460 --> 52:58.580
Let me see, how about this one?

52:58.580 --> 52:59.140
Delicious.

52:59.860 --> 53:00.980
That bird looks delicious?

53:00.980 --> 53:01.540
Okay, yeah, yeah.

53:01.540 --> 53:02.100
Great point.

53:02.100 --> 53:02.600
Great.

53:04.020 --> 53:04.900
It's small.

53:04.900 --> 53:05.460
Kickable.

53:06.100 --> 53:06.740
No.

53:06.740 --> 53:07.140
No.

53:07.140 --> 53:09.540
Wait, we can go with delicious but not kickable?

53:09.540 --> 53:12.260
No, because it's mean and it's too edgy and it's too-

53:12.260 --> 53:12.980
Huggable.

53:12.980 --> 53:13.940
Spencer's gifts.

53:13.940 --> 53:14.980
Huggable will allow.

53:14.980 --> 53:16.340
I would like to hug an ostrich.

53:16.980 --> 53:18.260
A big bird.

53:18.260 --> 53:19.380
Two, we're at 30 right now.

53:19.380 --> 53:21.620
Can we do two words together?

53:21.620 --> 53:23.620
And it could just be my pet.

53:23.620 --> 53:23.860
Yeah.

53:23.860 --> 53:24.820
Because they can be my pet.

53:25.700 --> 53:26.820
They look like your pet.

53:26.820 --> 53:28.020
My savior.

53:28.020 --> 53:29.700
My pet is 31 and 32.

53:30.340 --> 53:31.620
You say my savior?

53:31.620 --> 53:32.420
I did, yes.

53:32.420 --> 53:33.220
33, 34.

53:34.340 --> 53:35.620
Everybody gets a two word one.

53:35.620 --> 53:36.420
Mine's my pet.

53:37.140 --> 53:38.340
Travis did my savior.

53:38.340 --> 53:39.700
And Justin, what's your two word one?

53:40.340 --> 53:41.060
My immortal.

53:41.060 --> 53:43.140
My immortal gets us up to 36.

53:43.140 --> 53:44.340
We love these birds.

53:45.140 --> 53:46.020
Half angel.

53:46.580 --> 53:47.380
Nope.

53:47.380 --> 53:48.500
Is it hyphenated?

53:48.500 --> 53:49.060
Yes.

53:49.060 --> 53:49.940
It doesn't make sense.

53:49.940 --> 53:50.900
We're still at 36.

53:51.620 --> 53:52.340
Criss angel.

53:53.620 --> 53:54.580
I'm torn on that one.

53:56.660 --> 53:57.700
I could go either way.

53:58.900 --> 54:00.580
Birds don't look like criss angel.

54:00.580 --> 54:03.140
Criss angel can sometimes look like a bird.

54:03.140 --> 54:04.740
He can turn into nine birds.

54:04.740 --> 54:07.300
But that's not, I don't think that visually describes birds

54:07.300 --> 54:10.260
as much as it sort of generally describes criss angel

54:10.260 --> 54:10.900
and his abilities.

54:10.900 --> 54:12.020
We are still at 36.

54:12.020 --> 54:13.140
I'm going to say biblical.

54:14.020 --> 54:14.340
Okay.

54:15.060 --> 54:16.180
They look biblical?

54:16.180 --> 54:18.020
Yeah, it's just like you see a dove and you're like,

54:18.020 --> 54:19.940
there's one of Jesus's good friends.

54:22.420 --> 54:23.220
Deliverers.

54:23.860 --> 54:25.460
Oh man, you don't know what adjectives are.

54:25.460 --> 54:26.500
Let's stop, let's stop, let's stop.

54:26.500 --> 54:27.140
We're at 37.

54:27.140 --> 54:28.980
I feel like we're going to get really chunked up here

54:28.980 --> 54:32.660
if we don't like get back to basics real quick.

54:32.660 --> 54:33.060
Beak.

54:33.060 --> 54:33.300
Yes.

54:35.060 --> 54:36.180
We already got beaked, yeah.

54:36.180 --> 54:37.140
I think we got bebeaked.

54:37.140 --> 54:40.820
I think I feel like we're missing, what about like extant?

54:41.700 --> 54:44.020
Yeah, like they're corporeal.

54:44.020 --> 54:44.660
Corporeal.

54:44.660 --> 54:45.380
Look there.

54:45.380 --> 54:48.740
They look not transparent and not translucent.

54:48.740 --> 54:49.380
Opaque.

54:50.180 --> 54:51.060
Opaque, yeah.

54:51.060 --> 54:52.580
Birds are opaque.

54:52.580 --> 54:53.620
Can I hit you with this one?

54:54.980 --> 54:55.540
Birds.

54:56.340 --> 54:57.300
Oh, okay.

54:57.300 --> 54:58.260
Okay.

54:58.260 --> 55:00.900
I feel like that's describing birds in one word.

55:00.900 --> 55:05.620
But see, what's good about that one is that it does describe

55:05.620 --> 55:08.340
birds look like birds, but also if somebody just finds this

55:08.340 --> 55:10.660
list sitting on the street, they're going to kind of know

55:10.660 --> 55:12.340
what we're talking about when they get to birds.

55:12.340 --> 55:14.500
I mean, it is number 41, so they're going to be

55:14.500 --> 55:16.580
confused up to that, but when they see birds,

55:16.580 --> 55:18.340
it's like the secret codex.

55:18.340 --> 55:19.780
Let me see what you guys think about this one.

55:20.660 --> 55:21.620
Toronto!

55:21.620 --> 55:22.500
Like the Blue Jays.

55:22.500 --> 55:24.340
Toronto Blue Jays is 42.

55:24.340 --> 55:25.220
Now here's my question.

55:25.220 --> 55:28.100
Maybe the last three words, Griffin, because it didn't say

55:28.100 --> 55:31.700
we can't use punctuation, can just be, you know, birds.

55:31.700 --> 55:35.380
And it's just, you know, comma, birds, question mark.

55:35.380 --> 55:36.660
We already done our compound once.

55:36.660 --> 55:37.700
We already said they're birds.

55:37.700 --> 55:40.500
We have eight words left, and these are our home stretch,

55:40.500 --> 55:41.540
and we really got to make them count.

55:41.540 --> 55:42.820
We've gone really long in this recording,

55:42.820 --> 55:44.420
but this is an important thing now.

55:44.420 --> 55:45.220
Fatherly.

55:45.220 --> 55:46.660
Sorry, you both over spoke.

55:46.660 --> 55:46.900
Okay.

55:46.900 --> 55:48.740
Now I want to hear Travis's first.

55:48.740 --> 55:49.780
I'll go second.

55:49.780 --> 55:50.660
Hungry.

55:50.660 --> 55:52.500
Birds do can look hungry.

55:52.500 --> 55:52.900
Yes.

55:52.900 --> 55:55.460
Birds do can look hungry.

55:55.460 --> 55:56.260
Paternal.

55:56.260 --> 55:56.820
Paternal.

55:56.820 --> 55:57.060
How?

55:57.700 --> 55:58.740
Just because they're on the nest?

55:58.740 --> 56:00.340
It looks like it would be a good dad.

56:00.340 --> 56:00.660
Okay.

56:00.660 --> 56:01.460
Oh, I've got it.

56:01.460 --> 56:02.340
Thieving.

56:02.340 --> 56:03.380
Oh, I like that.

56:03.380 --> 56:04.580
Show off one word.

56:07.220 --> 56:08.580
Vain is a word.

56:08.580 --> 56:09.700
Vain's an adjective.

56:09.700 --> 56:10.100
Vain.

56:10.100 --> 56:10.900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

56:10.900 --> 56:11.620
How about this?

56:11.620 --> 56:12.580
Guys, guys, just stop.

56:12.580 --> 56:13.380
Hold on.

56:13.380 --> 56:16.180
We got four left, so I don't want them to be slams on birds.

56:16.180 --> 56:18.340
I want the last four to be good words about birds.

56:18.340 --> 56:19.300
Can I give you this one?

56:19.300 --> 56:20.420
Avuncular.

56:20.420 --> 56:23.060
What's that mean?

56:23.060 --> 56:24.660
Like unto an uncle.

56:24.660 --> 56:27.140
A nature that is like an uncle.

56:27.140 --> 56:29.060
An uncle style nature.

56:29.060 --> 56:31.300
So wait, you're saying you would look at a bird and say,

56:31.300 --> 56:35.460
I would let that bird maybe like hang out with my daughter,

56:35.460 --> 56:37.060
who would be its niece.

56:37.060 --> 56:40.900
That bird could be my dad's brother.

56:40.900 --> 56:41.300
Okay.

56:41.860 --> 56:42.180
Yeah.

56:43.700 --> 56:45.940
That bird I would go to a baseball game with.

56:46.660 --> 56:48.500
I'm not going to put that one on the list.

56:48.500 --> 56:48.820
Okay.

56:48.820 --> 56:49.300
That's fair.

56:49.300 --> 56:49.860
You know what?

56:49.860 --> 56:51.540
That one may have been too far.

56:51.540 --> 56:51.940
We're at 46.

56:51.940 --> 56:52.980
Did we say delicate?

56:53.860 --> 56:54.420
Delicate.

56:54.980 --> 56:55.780
Yeah, we'll allow that.

56:58.180 --> 56:58.980
I did.

56:58.980 --> 57:00.100
We set up, right?

57:00.100 --> 57:00.900
Pretty early.

57:00.900 --> 57:02.820
What about zany?

57:02.820 --> 57:04.660
Because they look so zany.

57:04.660 --> 57:05.700
Yeah, they can be funny.

57:05.700 --> 57:06.180
Zany.

57:06.180 --> 57:07.860
I thought you said veiny.

57:07.860 --> 57:08.500
We're at 48.

57:08.500 --> 57:09.300
They can be veiny.

57:09.300 --> 57:09.940
That's 49.

57:09.940 --> 57:12.660
Okay, we got one word left, so let's make it count.

57:12.660 --> 57:18.500
And, you know, we may have a few here and have to like pick the top contender.

57:18.500 --> 57:20.980
I'm gonna, if we haven't said it before, proud.

57:22.100 --> 57:23.780
I think I'm almost certain we've done that one.

57:23.780 --> 57:24.740
How about this one?

57:24.740 --> 57:25.300
Eggs.

57:26.180 --> 57:29.060
Well, around.

57:31.940 --> 57:34.100
Well, we kind of did a whole round of they exist.

57:34.740 --> 57:38.660
I feel like around just kind of acknowledges their existence again.

57:38.660 --> 57:39.780
Dinosaurs.

57:39.780 --> 57:41.300
Dinosaurs is bad.

57:41.300 --> 57:43.380
Well, because birds used to be dinosaurs.

57:43.380 --> 57:44.260
Yeah, but they ain't now.

57:44.260 --> 57:48.820
What about pointless?

57:50.820 --> 57:51.780
That's so mean.

57:52.900 --> 57:54.100
What have they done for me lately?

57:54.980 --> 57:57.060
How about shirt ruiners?

57:58.580 --> 58:00.900
I think shitty because that covers a lot.

58:00.900 --> 58:01.860
I already did shitty.

58:01.860 --> 58:02.740
Pay attention.

58:02.740 --> 58:04.020
God, we've been in this bit for too long.

58:04.020 --> 58:05.300
We need a 50th word.

58:05.300 --> 58:06.900
Just give them the 50th word.

58:06.900 --> 58:07.780
Beak.

58:07.780 --> 58:10.900
No, we did beak at the beginning, although I do like that.

58:10.900 --> 58:12.660
I do like it coming around like that.

58:12.660 --> 58:15.300
Yeah, I like the, we'll call them beacons.

58:16.260 --> 58:16.820
Oh, I got it.

58:16.820 --> 58:17.700
Oh, wait a minute.

58:17.700 --> 58:18.340
What do I got?

58:18.340 --> 58:19.300
Oh, I got it.

58:19.300 --> 58:21.060
What about presidential?

58:21.060 --> 58:22.020
That's pretty good.

58:22.020 --> 58:23.380
What about hyphenated?

58:23.380 --> 58:24.500
The end.

58:24.500 --> 58:27.140
And that could be, if we turn the list into the teacher,

58:27.140 --> 58:28.580
they'll know that that's where I finished.

58:28.580 --> 58:29.300
I love that.

58:29.300 --> 58:30.100
That's so good.

58:30.820 --> 58:31.780
All right, that's 50.

58:31.780 --> 58:32.340
Thanks, folks.

58:32.900 --> 58:33.380
Thanks, folks.

58:33.380 --> 58:35.940
We've had a great time with you this week on My Brother, My Brother, Me.

58:35.940 --> 58:38.180
We hope you've enjoyed yourself as well.

58:38.180 --> 58:42.660
Well, you're always so nice to us and listen to our podcasts and stuff.

58:42.660 --> 58:44.500
And we just think that that's real swell of you.

58:44.500 --> 58:46.100
We just think the world of you guys.

58:46.100 --> 58:50.740
All things considered, I think it's really nice that you listen to our podcasts.

58:50.740 --> 58:53.780
And I also think it's really nice that you listen to All Things Considered.

58:53.780 --> 58:54.340
Yeah, thank you.

58:54.340 --> 58:56.420
They really need your support now more than ever.

58:56.420 --> 58:59.860
We're doing some live shows coming up April 2nd, 3rd, and 4th

58:59.860 --> 59:03.380
in San Jose, California, and Salt Lake City, Utah.

59:03.380 --> 59:07.940
You can get tickets for those at mcroy.family and then click on tours there.

59:07.940 --> 59:11.380
And actually, the San Jose ones sold out so quickly.

59:11.380 --> 59:16.260
We had to open up new tiers of the theater, like new levels and balconies and stuff.

59:16.260 --> 59:18.020
So there are more tickets available.

59:18.020 --> 59:22.260
So if you tried to get those tickets a couple of days ago and weren't able to,

59:22.260 --> 59:24.740
try again because we put some more on sale.

59:25.460 --> 59:28.420

And thanks to John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song,

59:46.980 --> 59:49.540
It's a Departure, off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

59:49.540 --> 59:52.660
It's a very good song, very good album that you should totally have by now.

59:52.660 --> 59:54.900

01:00:06.820 --> 01:00:09.140
Is that going to do it for us?

01:00:09.140 --> 01:00:10.020
I think so.

01:00:10.020 --> 01:00:11.300
Here's the final one.

01:00:11.300 --> 01:00:12.500
It was sent in by Merit Palmer.

01:00:12.500 --> 01:00:12.980
Thank you, Merit.

01:00:12.980 --> 01:00:16.340
It's Yahoo Answers user Henry who asks,

01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:22.660
Who out there hates BMW or Mercedes like me?

01:00:22.660 --> 01:00:25.460
I hate those cars with a potion.

01:00:25.460 --> 01:00:33.140
My name is Justin McElroy.

01:00:33.140 --> 01:00:34.580

You've been my brother, my brother.

01:00:36.660 --> 01:00:56.980
May I kiss your dad's square on the lips?

I'm bailiff Jesse Thorn, and justice is within your reach.

01:01:06.580 --> 01:01:09.220
My mom refuses to take my phone calls.

01:01:09.220 --> 01:01:11.940
My boyfriend says I should take our cats with me to graduate school,

01:01:11.940 --> 01:01:12.980
but I think he should keep them.

01:01:13.780 --> 01:01:17.700
In the court of Judge John Hodgman, justice rules.

01:01:17.700 --> 01:01:21.140
My partner's board game collection is out of control.

01:01:21.940 --> 01:01:24.660
My sister won't stop stealing my clothes.

01:01:24.660 --> 01:01:26.020
I'm Judge John Hodgman.

01:01:26.020 --> 01:01:27.140
I'm tough, but fair.

01:01:27.140 --> 01:01:28.660
Tough, but fair.

01:01:28.660 --> 01:01:30.660
I'll bring you justice, and I'm only a cop.

01:01:30.660 --> 01:01:32.580
I'll bring you justice, and I'm only a click away.

01:01:33.300 --> 01:01:34.100

01:01:45.060 --> 01:01:46.180
