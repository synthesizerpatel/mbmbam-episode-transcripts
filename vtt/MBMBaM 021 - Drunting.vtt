00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:06.000 --> 00:12.000
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:12.000 --> 00:19.000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
What's up, you cool baby?

00:21.000 --> 00:30.000
If you change your mind, I'm the first in line. Honey, I'm still free, take a chance on me.

00:30.000 --> 00:40.000
If you need me, let me know, I'm gonna be around. If you got no place to go, when you're feeling down.

00:40.000 --> 00:49.000
If you're all alone, when the pretty birds have gone out of their way, take a chance on me.

00:49.000 --> 01:00.000
Sure, you get to take a day off once a year on a Monday, eat some meat, see your kids or once.

01:00.000 --> 01:05.000
You should also miss out on my brother and my brother and me.

01:05.000 --> 01:10.000
Our most sacred holiday at my brother and my brother and me.

01:10.000 --> 01:17.000
Granted, maybe we should have warned people in the previous episode that we were going to be taking a siesta.

01:17.000 --> 01:23.000
I thought that Labor Day was such a cherished day.

01:23.000 --> 01:27.000
I thought it would be assumed that we were going to take our siesta.

01:27.000 --> 01:32.000
What kind of life are you living that you know like a week ahead what you're going to be doing the next week? That's crazy.

01:32.000 --> 01:38.000
That's crazy. If we support one thing here on my bim bam, it's living in the moment.

01:38.000 --> 01:43.000
And in the moment on Wednesday, we decided Labor Day wouldn't work out.

01:43.000 --> 01:48.000
It was very impulsive. It's a gift. That's why they call it the present.

01:48.000 --> 01:53.000
Oh, mill that over for a while. Did you see how angry people got?

01:53.000 --> 01:58.000
Yeah, man, like tear it apart.

01:58.000 --> 02:02.000
Why are they trying to download a podcast on Labor Day?

02:02.000 --> 02:07.000
Why aren't they out drinking a Miller High Life with their buds and playing ladder ball?

02:07.000 --> 02:13.000
Here's a funny here's a funny truth that you can take from what you will. We're recording this on September 11th.

02:13.000 --> 02:18.000
Yeah. Well, so priorities, I guess. So who's mad now?

02:18.000 --> 02:23.000
Who's mad now, America? I put off my Patriot Day.

02:23.000 --> 02:27.000
I forget what I do every year, but I do something and and I put it off for you guys.

02:27.000 --> 02:32.000
You said you'd never forget. You're right.

02:32.000 --> 02:37.000
So let's get it crack a lock. And this is, of course, an advice show for the modern era.

02:37.000 --> 02:43.000
And Labor Day aside, we still are going to cling to that.

02:43.000 --> 02:49.000
That ethos. God, I wish you guys could see the question list when Travis emails them out.

02:49.000 --> 02:55.000
It would be less. It would be less crazy if he cut letters out of magazines and glued them to his scanner.

02:55.000 --> 02:59.000
I swear to God, it looks it's just so many different things together.

02:59.000 --> 03:04.000
OK, here we go. So. Yes.

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
I have a friend whose last name is McElroy.

03:07.000 --> 03:12.000
Should I trust him? Given the fact that there was no new ma bim bam last week?

03:12.000 --> 03:21.000
I wonder if it's all McElroy's that are liars or is that a particular trait reserved to the West Virginia McElroy clan for spring?

03:21.000 --> 03:25.000
It's all of them. You son of a bitch. You know what? Take a chill pill.

03:25.000 --> 03:29.000
Hey, chillax. Is that it?

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
Is that our answer to that one? That's our winning.

03:31.000 --> 03:39.000
Oh, I thought you were that your inflection said to me that you were that you were going into something, but you really just wanted him to take a form spring.

03:39.000 --> 03:43.000
Pump those brakes. Pump the brakes. It's all good.

03:43.000 --> 03:52.000
It's all good. We needed the real reason we took the day off is because I was traveling and Justin was traveling and Travis was hunting four day drunk.

03:52.000 --> 03:56.000
I was hunting and on a four day drunk. I was drunk hunting.

03:56.000 --> 04:03.000
We took a week off. We did some spirit journeying, some some literal journeying.

04:03.000 --> 04:07.000
I, I dropped some. I dropped some peyote in a desert.

04:07.000 --> 04:13.000
Can can we address the fact that Travis just combined drunk and hunting into drunting?

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
It's never been drunting. It's a pretty killer portmanteau.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
Every but there is no hunting without drunting.

04:19.000 --> 04:23.000
I was going to say, I'm pretty sure those two things can't be divorced from one another.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
Yeah, although most of those guys actually divorce.

04:26.000 --> 04:33.000
Right. Interestingly enough, this weekend, me and my cousin, same age, are moving into our first apartment as roommates this weekend.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
It seems like he's already slacking on apartment responsibilities.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
We've split up like getting certain utilities.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
What should I do?

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
Don't let that shit hit the fans.

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
We learned the hard way to hold up his end.

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
Or do I pick up the slack so I can have electricity in my new apartment?

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
Rob, you know who I bet has a great answer for this?

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
Griffin.

04:50.000 --> 04:55.000
Yeah. Hey, Rob, if you do let shit hit fan, he is going to start cleaning up around the place.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
Like if you throw shit into your fan.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
Oh, boy.

04:58.000 --> 05:02.000
The problem is if you don't have electricity, the fan won't be on.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
So it'll just like hit the fan and then just like slide down.

05:05.000 --> 05:09.000
It won't have the buckshot effect that you might be hoping for.

05:09.000 --> 05:17.000
I find that like arrangements like these that I've seen in my life, and you guys probably have some more insight in this, but I think it works.

05:17.000 --> 05:21.000
Like, I don't think you should split up setting up utilities.

05:21.000 --> 05:28.000
Like, I think it should be there should be one person in charge of like making sure all that shit is on point.

05:28.000 --> 05:33.000
And then one person who has to write a check because if you split it up between two, it's not going to fly.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
In every apartment I've ever lived in, I've always been utility man.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
I don't know why.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
What the fuck?

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
I don't know.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
I don't know how it comes down to that always.

05:40.000 --> 05:51.000
But like, I think it's maybe just I have like a subconscious control freak thing and I worry that if I don't do it, then the other people that I live with won't do it, which is a completely irrational fear.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
And the glasses.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
Except for maybe.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
Right.

05:54.000 --> 06:02.000
In any relationship, whether it's, you know, dating or living together or roommates or friends, there's always one person that's going to be more responsible than the other one.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
And so it makes sense.

06:03.000 --> 06:07.000
Like, if one person was an amazing cook, why would the other person cook?

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
You know what I mean?

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
Sure.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
You're more.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
So who was that party when you and I lived together, Travis?

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
The more responsible one?

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
It was you.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
Yeah.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
You think?

06:15.000 --> 06:19.000
But that is because Justin and I have trained you from a very young age to do anything.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
To be the bitch.

06:20.000 --> 06:24.000
Well, if we're like, oh my God, the phone, you'll run and answer the phone.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
So I just did that with electric bills.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
I'll be honest.

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
When you said that just now, I started to run into my kitchen.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
I realize that.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
You got halfway in there.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
You realize, hey, wait a minute.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
This is a trick.

06:33.000 --> 06:40.000
Yeah, I think it's more important that you just take up the utilities charge.

06:40.000 --> 06:48.000
And I think you can split duties as far as all the utilities you mow the lawn or do the

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
dishes.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
Right.

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
But what is important is that you do talk about it.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
Because the last thing you need is to live with your cousin in two months.

06:56.000 --> 07:00.000
And every time you see him, you imagine killing him in the night.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
You know what I mean?

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
I'm upset with you.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
I am upset with you.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
I have feelings.

07:06.000 --> 07:10.000
They live in this apartment with you.

07:10.000 --> 07:14.000
Nate on Gmail asks, is it weird that I've been Facebook poking an ex-girlfriend of mine

07:14.000 --> 07:18.000
solely for the fact that it's an excuse for her to keep me on her mind for quick hookups

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
whenever she's in town?

07:19.000 --> 07:22.000
Relationship wise, we're a horrible pairing.

07:22.000 --> 07:27.000
But when it comes to getting down, it's crazy dope and seems like an ephemeral trip to the

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
bone zone.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
Not a Gmail.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
That's how I'm going to say his name.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
Not Nate.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
Not a.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
I'd say it sounds like not a.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
You have a pretty good grasp of their relationship.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
Is it is it weird?

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
No.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
Is it despicable?

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
Maybe a little sleazy.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
But like, it's weird.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
It's not weird that you're boning down on your ex-girlfriend every time she comes in

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
town.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
Whatever.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
Like, that's your bag.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
You guys have that arrangement.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
Cool.

07:55.000 --> 08:04.000
What's weird is that the exercise that you conduct in order to facilitate said boning

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
is a Facebook poke.

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
I think you're thinking of a poke for a poke.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
Maybe.

08:10.000 --> 08:15.000
My grandma pokes me every now and then.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
Facebook pokes.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
Please put that in context.

08:18.000 --> 08:22.000
When you guys get poked on Facebook, do you imagine yourself getting poked in the tum

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
and doing a little giggle and squeal?

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
Like, that's the kind of poke I always imagine.

08:26.000 --> 08:30.000
I always imagine getting poked right in the base of the back of my skull and turning around

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
real quick.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
Hey, jerk.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
Hey, jerk.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
Turn around.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
I'm poking you.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
I don't think I've ever.

08:36.000 --> 08:40.000
I think maybe I poked someone back in the 60s.

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
I think it's probably been a while since my last poke.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
Man, 60s Facebook was the best.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
Do you remember that?

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
Yeah.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
You know what we should do?

08:48.000 --> 08:52.000
I think the MBMBAM community should start just crazy-ass poking each other.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
I think that we need to get pokes going again.

08:55.000 --> 08:59.000
It's like, hugs, kisses on the cheek, both of those are done.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
Ow.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
Pokes are the new jam.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
I just poked you.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
Did you really?

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
I'll start poking people right now on Facebook.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
I have it open in another window.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
Wait, wait.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
Speaking of Facebook, I have to talk about this.

09:12.000 --> 09:20.000
I don't think you guys got this invite to this exclusive event, but I got an invite

09:20.000 --> 09:27.000
to a MBMBAM listening party that's going on right now, hopefully, otherwise I'm making

09:27.000 --> 09:32.000
a jackass out of myself, in Jeff Montblock's dorm room.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
Did you guys get that invite?

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
No.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
I'm looking at this guest list.

09:36.000 --> 09:39.000
It's a high-class affair.

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
Would you say exclusive?

09:42.000 --> 09:47.000
There are only five people attending, so it's either exclusive or just really sad.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
Or both.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
I think it's a great idea.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
It's exclusively sad.

09:51.000 --> 09:57.000
So Brendan and Henry and Jeff and Michael and Robbie, I hope the party's going well.

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
I hope maybe you're meeting some new people.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
But I doubt it.

10:01.000 --> 10:06.000
Maybe you've got a dance mix that you're playing, maybe a little mingling.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
I think this is a great idea.

10:08.000 --> 10:16.000
I think that listening parties are going to be a great way to spread the MBMBAM to your

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
friends and family.

10:17.000 --> 10:24.000
Word of mouth is so much more contained and concentrated in a party situation.

10:24.000 --> 10:28.000
Just be careful, because I've never heard of a MBMBAM listening party that didn't turn

10:28.000 --> 10:32.000
into a key party right afterwards, almost instantly.

10:32.000 --> 10:36.000
You feel so smart, you're on a knowledge high, and then what's up?

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
It's amazing how tight those Venn diagrams are.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
It's 100%.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
That's what she said?

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
I don't know.

10:46.000 --> 10:49.000
Well, I wasn't sure.

10:49.000 --> 10:55.000
Now, ironically, I'll have to do a Venn diagram to see if that was funny or not.

10:55.000 --> 11:00.000
I'm a 26-year-old male and have begun to notice a confusing trend.

11:00.000 --> 11:04.000
What's the proper way to greet an older woman?

11:04.000 --> 11:07.000
Griffin just demonstrated.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
I'm not sure we have to go too much further.

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
Griffin, what is the proper greeting?

11:12.000 --> 11:17.000
I noticed that recently, when I greet women, they started kissing my cheek and not merely

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
giving the hugs I'm used to receiving.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
See, that's what I'm saying.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
Hugs out, kisses in.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
Do I go ahead and kiss them as well?

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
Do I pretend the awkward moment never happened?

11:26.000 --> 11:29.000
Or do I punch them in the face like Travis is thinking?

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
Help, please, Pat.

11:31.000 --> 11:37.000
I've seen an upsettingly positive response to Travis talking about punching women in

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
the face during last week's show.

11:39.000 --> 11:44.000
What seemed like an offhanded comment has become a doctrine amongst certain sects.

11:44.000 --> 11:47.000
You tapped a weird, creepy vein that I'm not happy exists.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
Yeah.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
Someone heard that and was like, yeah, yeah!

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
Finally, the voice I've been waiting to hear.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
And then I started my own kind of fight club.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
Only it's not a fight club.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
No one talks about a woman-punching club.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
They have a woman-punching fight club.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
It's called prison.

11:59.000 --> 12:02.000
We're in prison now.

12:02.000 --> 12:06.000
Pat, you're missing out on the third option.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
Do I go in a case?

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
Do you pretend it never happened?

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
No.

12:09.000 --> 12:15.000
You make it even more awkward by when they break away, you make intense eye contact and

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
say, I really appreciated that.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
I needed that in the worst way.

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
God, that was really nice.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
That was exactly what I needed.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
You smell like the sweetest cocoa butter.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
That was nice.

12:27.000 --> 12:30.000
Look them right in the nose and say, just one?

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
Just the one?

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
You don't want to go back for a second scoop?

12:35.000 --> 12:42.000
I think the older you get, the more acceptable it is to have affectionate greetings.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
Does that make sense?

12:44.000 --> 12:47.000
As you get older, the more affectionate your greetings become.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
The less smileable you are as a sexual partner.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
Sure.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
I think that's something you earn.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
I think that's something you unlock.

12:54.000 --> 13:00.000
I think if all of us had our druthers whenever we met new people, he'd give them seven minutes

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
in heaven real quick.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
Just to suss them out?

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
Yeah, just to suss them out.

13:06.000 --> 13:14.000
At my age of 23, I think I'm at a mid-range hug.

13:14.000 --> 13:20.000
Not like a quick embrace like you did in middle school, but not like the long 30-something

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
this means something hug.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
Yeah.

13:24.000 --> 13:29.000
I decided to skip straight to my 80s.

13:29.000 --> 13:33.000
When I meet new people, I say something vaguely racist to them and then confuse them for my

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
deceased wife.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
Oh, I like it.

13:37.000 --> 13:43.000
It's said some people are like, I don't know, that's a bit much, but some people really

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
connect to it because they love old people.

13:45.000 --> 13:50.000
I tell them that they look like celebrities that have been dead for 30 years.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
I like that.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
You look just like Clark Gable.

13:53.000 --> 13:56.000
Do you want to watch this original?

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
Yahoo answers.

13:58.000 --> 14:02.000
This question was sent in to us by Cheesecake Jones.

14:02.000 --> 14:05.000
I think you know what it is.

14:05.000 --> 14:12.000
It's a Yahoo answers question from Lindsay O'Malley who asks, what does my son mean?

14:12.000 --> 14:17.000
My son keeps saying something strange and I can't find what it means anywhere.

14:17.000 --> 14:25.000
I'll ask him to do something and he'll say, Mom, I'm on that like a dong nat.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
What does he mean?

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
I searched on Google and got nothing.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
Is this a music reference?

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
Drugs?

14:31.000 --> 14:40.000
People smoke dongs with weed, but I didn't find one in his room.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.000
Help.

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
Yeah.

14:42.000 --> 14:50.000
Let me get one of those glass blown pipes and what's the biggest weed dong that you

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
have that I can legally buy?

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
For tobacco, of course.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
Yeah.

14:55.000 --> 14:59.000
I want to smoke tobacco out of the biggest dong you have in the store.

14:59.000 --> 15:02.000
Just the biggest one with a novelty name too.

15:02.000 --> 15:05.000
Help me out, Travis.

15:05.000 --> 15:10.000
I'm sure you know more novelty dong names than I do.

15:10.000 --> 15:14.000
I don't want to play this game because any answer I give is incriminating.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.000
You always lose.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
You always lose this game.

15:17.000 --> 15:22.000
You guys are poking fun at this, but I think that there's a deeper level on which I am

15:22.000 --> 15:30.000
concerned, and that is apparently Lindsay O'Malley's son has an infestation of gnats

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
on his dong.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
He's the only one using this phrase.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
That can't be a good sign.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
No.

15:36.000 --> 15:41.000
If you Google dong nat and nothing comes up, it's a medical problem.

15:41.000 --> 15:50.000
Is it possible that he has some sort of sexual fetish with rotten fruits that perhaps is

15:50.000 --> 15:53.000
attracting some unwanted aphids?

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
Is it possible?

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
Yes, it is.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
Gnats are aphids, right?

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
I got that right.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
I believe they're flies.

16:02.000 --> 16:06.000
Lindsay, I don't think you have anything to worry about except it sounds like your son

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
is sweetly retarded.

16:07.000 --> 16:11.000
Also, he's 35 years old.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
I don't know if that's a problem.

16:13.000 --> 16:17.000
Also, why does his crotch smell like a two-week-old, golden, delicious apple?

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
Hard to say.

16:18.000 --> 16:24.000
Actually, Lindsay, it sounds like your son's pretty cool.

16:24.000 --> 16:28.000
If somebody out there in my real life said that, I would probably freak out a little

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
bit.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
Well, here's the scale.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
35 years old, it's a problem.

16:32.000 --> 16:35.000
12 years old, coolest kid ever.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
Coolest kid ever.

16:36.000 --> 16:40.000
So, where do I...

16:40.000 --> 16:45.000
This is something Greggy, Greggy from Gmail, or Greggy from Gmail wants to know.

16:45.000 --> 16:48.000
Where do you find the motivation to finish a project?

16:48.000 --> 16:54.000
I have a terrible habit of starting projects, like Android apps, websites, games, et cetera,

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
and never finishing them.

16:55.000 --> 16:59.000
There's always a game to play, a movie to watch, or something less productive to do,

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
so it's hard to finish random projects.

17:01.000 --> 17:05.000
Where do you find the motivation to build the empire that is my boom-bam?

17:05.000 --> 17:08.000
Are you kidding?

17:08.000 --> 17:14.000
Do you know how much motivation is required to poop out a show every week?

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
Or sometimes not?

17:16.000 --> 17:20.000
Well, I mean, yeah, really, it flagged enough that we took a week off.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
Two weeks off.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
We're really bad at this.

17:23.000 --> 17:30.000
The thing with the boom-bam is that, and part of what makes it...

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
We don't need motivation.

17:31.000 --> 17:34.000
Our motivation to do it is that we really enjoy it.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
That's kind of all the motivation we need.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
And all that money.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
All that.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
Oh, gosh.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
And all that sweet, sweet...

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
Cheddar.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.000
Cheddar.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.000
That I buy with the money.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
These Siberian tiger puppies aren't going to pay for themselves.

17:46.000 --> 17:47.000
Yep.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
Wait, are tigers puppies?

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
Are you riding your tiger again during the show?

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
We said during the show you wouldn't.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
But he's so epic.

17:54.000 --> 17:58.000
Have Gregor feed a mistake and keep him out of the room for like an hour.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
Okay, hold on a second.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
Gregor!

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
Yes, no.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
Feed a mistake.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
Greg, listen.

18:04.000 --> 18:12.000
I think I have this pit of energy in my belly that I can just reach down into.

18:12.000 --> 18:15.000
And not literally, but I visualize that.

18:15.000 --> 18:19.000
Like reaching down into my stuff, you know?

18:19.000 --> 18:24.000
And just pulling out the reserves that I need to get something done.

18:24.000 --> 18:28.000
Usually accompanied by a power jam.

18:28.000 --> 18:31.000
That almost always does the trick for me.

18:31.000 --> 18:35.000
I'm going to preface this by saying that this might be something a lazy person says.

18:35.000 --> 18:38.000
But if you don't have the motivation to do something, don't do it.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
Just chill, man.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
Yeah, fuck it.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
Who cares?

18:42.000 --> 18:46.000
At the end of the day, if you were to get hit by a bus, are you going to look back and

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
say, thank goodness I finished that novel?

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
Or are you going to say, thank goodness I took that three-hour nap?

18:51.000 --> 18:56.000
I'll tell you what really helps motivate me.

18:56.000 --> 19:00.000
And you might want to try this, Greg.

19:00.000 --> 19:07.000
Once you accept the inevitability and ever-increasing closeness of your death, I think that will

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
really help to motivate you.

19:08.000 --> 19:12.000
Because you don't want to leave this world without an Android app in it, do you?

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
You don't.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
It's just around the corner, Greg.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
Just around the corner, Greg.

19:16.000 --> 19:22.000
Maybe pass in the Will & Grace marathon and get busy living.

19:22.000 --> 19:25.000
Or get busy dying.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
Or get busy dying.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
One of the two.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
Shawshank!

19:28.000 --> 19:31.000
Greg, you've just been shanked.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
You've been shanked, Greg.

19:33.000 --> 19:37.000
And if you got shanked, who would finish I Fart for the Android?

19:37.000 --> 19:38.000
No one would.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
That's who, Greg.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
You are the only Greg we have, Greg.

19:41.000 --> 19:44.000
Don't leave us without your Greg-ness.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
Well, there it is.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
If that's not motivation, I don't know what is.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
Come on, Greg.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
And you can always call us, Greg.

19:50.000 --> 19:53.000
Also, speed.

19:53.000 --> 19:56.000
Gives you that extra boost you need.

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
Just a little bump.

19:57.000 --> 20:04.000
Just a little bumperoo to help you finish studying for that exam.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
Don't do drugs.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
Don't do drugs.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
I'm currently a senior in high school.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
I'm not.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
That's not true.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
But Coney is, from Gmail.

20:12.000 --> 20:16.000
And Coney says, I'm in charge of making our prom go on without a hitch.

20:16.000 --> 20:23.000
Do you, as the Wizards of Kool, have any ideas for a venue, theme, or other advice?

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
Underage drinking.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
Underage drinking.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
Is it a problem?

20:27.000 --> 20:28.000
As a theme.

20:28.000 --> 20:33.000
I think every prom is secretly themed underage drinking.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
It's themed.

20:34.000 --> 20:40.000
I snuck vodka into this prom in this shampoo bottle.

20:40.000 --> 20:45.000
What about the inevitability and ever-increasing closeness of your death?

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
How does that grab you?

20:47.000 --> 20:51.000
It's not terrible.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
I'm trying to remember some of the themes of our proms.

20:53.000 --> 20:58.000
And there's stuff like Paradise City and stuff like that.

20:58.000 --> 21:04.000
So I think what you need to do is you need to find an awesome 80s metal band.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
And my advice?

21:05.000 --> 21:06.000
Pour some sugar on me.

21:06.000 --> 21:11.000
And as people walk into the gym, you just dump buckets of sugar on them.

21:11.000 --> 21:14.000
What about a night of drunting?

21:14.000 --> 21:17.000
Subtitle, the most silliest game.

21:17.000 --> 21:20.000
And you just have everyone drunt each other.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
Oh, no, no.

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
Camouflage dresses.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
Most high schools, they actually forbid that.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
There's a two to three inch rule.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
What?

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
That you have to keep.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
You can't drunt anybody?

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
Yeah.

21:31.000 --> 21:37.000
Any orifices on two human beings have to remain at least two to three inches away from one another.

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
That's the new law.

21:38.000 --> 21:43.000
So does that mean if you shoot someone and create a new orifice, then you can actually get yourself in a catch-threat, too?

21:43.000 --> 21:44.000
Yeah.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
Like that kid.

21:45.000 --> 21:49.000
To be fair, though, a lot of schools will allow bow-drunting.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
Yeah, bow-drunting is fine.

21:51.000 --> 22:03.000
As long as it's a clean kill and you don't bring down more than, I think, 80 to 90 pounds of edible meat, basically.

22:03.000 --> 22:09.000
There's a formula on most walls next to the sign that reminds you to wash your hands and read.

22:09.000 --> 22:12.000
Also, can I suggest Wizards of Kool?

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
Wizards of Kool is good.

22:13.000 --> 22:17.000
How about a Roland Emmerich-themed prom?

22:17.000 --> 22:21.000
It's just a bunch of disasters going on.

22:21.000 --> 22:22.000
Whoa.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.000
I kind of like that.

22:23.000 --> 22:24.000
Yeah.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
And I don't just mean the pimply-faced kids.

22:26.000 --> 22:27.000
I mean, like, real disasters.

22:27.000 --> 22:31.000
Like, literally, one corner could be 2012, right?

22:31.000 --> 22:34.000
So it could look like a big flood.

22:34.000 --> 22:37.000
One corner could be Men in Black?

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
No, Independence Day.

22:39.000 --> 22:43.000
That one would be, obviously, aliens.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.000
Yeah.

22:44.000 --> 22:47.000
You could have a Godzilla area.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
Sure.

22:48.000 --> 22:52.000
An area where you drop the temperature all the way down, day after tomorrow.

22:52.000 --> 22:53.000
Yeah, loving it.

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
I love it.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
You have so many good ideas.

22:57.000 --> 23:02.000
If you can't come up with something out of these, then maybe you are the problem.

23:02.000 --> 23:05.000
But, Kony, all those are patented, so...

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
Yeah, any but those.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
Kony, you have a great opportunity right now.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
What if you made it a Kony-themed prom?

23:10.000 --> 23:11.000
Whoa.

23:11.000 --> 23:12.000
Ooh.

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
I don't know how you'd go about doing that.

23:14.000 --> 23:15.000
Just, like, big pictures of himself.

23:15.000 --> 23:18.000
Just big pictures of himself, like, throughout his lifetime.

23:18.000 --> 23:24.000
And nobody's allowed to dance except for him unless they're dancing with him.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
Does that make sense?

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
What about...

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
I think that's the greatest idea ever.

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
What about an evening of Mabim Bam?

23:31.000 --> 23:32.000
Okay.

23:32.000 --> 23:36.000
Subtitle, the only answer is slow dancing to Wilson Phillips.

23:36.000 --> 23:37.000
And it could be...

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
And it could just be all about us.

23:39.000 --> 23:42.000
Make you want to turn around and say goodbye.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
Say goodbye to them, baby.

23:44.000 --> 23:47.000
I'm gonna let them hold you down and make you cry.

23:47.000 --> 23:48.000
Don't you know?

23:48.000 --> 23:49.000
Don't you know?

23:49.000 --> 23:50.000
Don't you know?

23:50.000 --> 23:51.000
Things are changing.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
Things are gonna go your way.

23:53.000 --> 23:56.000
If you hold on one more day.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
One more day.

23:58.000 --> 24:01.000
I brought in Aaron Neville for a second.

24:01.000 --> 24:02.000
Wait.

24:02.000 --> 24:03.000
What?

24:03.000 --> 24:04.000
Aaron Neville.

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
You bring it.

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
I'm an unemployed mathematician.

24:07.000 --> 24:14.000
I send out resumes weekly to new places and haven't gotten a phone call or email back.

24:14.000 --> 24:19.000
My resume has a standard education, work experience, special skills, references, etc.

24:19.000 --> 24:24.000
I'm in an odd place where I am too educated for some jobs and not educated enough for others.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
Dummy.

24:25.000 --> 24:28.000
Since I have a master's degree, I can't get a job as a secretary or something like that

24:28.000 --> 24:31.000
because they know I'll only be there until something better comes along, okay?

24:31.000 --> 24:34.000
However, I don't have the experience needed for a lot of jobs

24:34.000 --> 24:39.000
because I taught for the last four years and don't want to teach anymore.

24:39.000 --> 24:43.000
So what can I do to my resume to get noticed?

24:43.000 --> 24:46.000
Or should I just give it up and go get a PhD?

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
Any help is appreciated.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
Sad math girl.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
That's who that's from.

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
Which is nice.

24:52.000 --> 24:55.000
We ask that people send in nicknames.

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
Yeah.

24:56.000 --> 24:57.000
That one's kind of depressing.

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
That one lands on the depressing end of the spectrum.

24:59.000 --> 25:02.000
But I suppose it works.

25:02.000 --> 25:05.000
Hey, I have a theory, sad math girl.

25:05.000 --> 25:14.000
What do you think about stop introducing yourself both in person and in your resume as a mathematician?

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
Because I read that and I was just like...

25:16.000 --> 25:17.000
Snoozer.

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
Yeah, right.

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
Let's hit the snooze button on this question.

25:19.000 --> 25:23.000
Yeah, there's no rule that says you have to put anything on your resume.

25:23.000 --> 25:29.000
So if your resume is like, this is too impressive, dumb it down.

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
Dumb it down.

25:30.000 --> 25:35.000
How about math magician or numerologist?

25:35.000 --> 25:39.000
Both of those, I think, have a little bit of extra flair.

25:39.000 --> 25:45.000
I think that one of the real practical ways that you can pad out your resume is to take fencing classes.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
And now stay with me.

25:47.000 --> 25:53.000
I think that if I was looking at a stack of resumes and you look at the experience, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

25:53.000 --> 25:59.000
You look at the bottom extracurriculars and you say, whoa.

25:59.000 --> 26:00.000
Fencing?

26:00.000 --> 26:05.000
And then you start to like construct a whole fantasy about this person because they're a sword fighter.

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
They're out there fight with swords.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.000
You wouldn't want them on the team.

26:08.000 --> 26:11.000
I don't want to poke holes in your thing here.

26:11.000 --> 26:25.000
But I would wager that, oh, 90% of all mathematicians or members of the mathematician community belong to some sort of society through creative anachronism.

26:25.000 --> 26:29.000
Meaning fencing is just old hat to them.

26:29.000 --> 26:30.000
They know all about-

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
So they can put on their resumes swashbuckler.

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
Still, still.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.000
Maybe not.

26:35.000 --> 26:41.000
Maybe you list amongst your curricular activities that you're not a member of the Society for Creative Anachronism.

26:41.000 --> 26:44.000
Yeah, I think that might be a true point.

26:44.000 --> 26:50.000
Just list a bunch of things that people would assume about you as a mathematician that you won't do.

26:50.000 --> 26:53.000
Like I won't tell you about integers or whatever.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
I promise.

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
My solemn promise to you.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
You need some sort of coolness indicator.

26:59.000 --> 27:00.000
Yeah.

27:00.000 --> 27:01.000
Just not fencing.

27:01.000 --> 27:05.000
Maybe a list of all the famous people that you've met.

27:05.000 --> 27:08.000
That might be kind of nice on a resume.

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
You've got to move away from this mathematician game.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
Because like we've all got calculators now.

27:12.000 --> 27:13.000
We're done with math.

27:13.000 --> 27:16.000
Like as far as something we need people to be good at, no more of that.

27:16.000 --> 27:17.000
We're past that.

27:17.000 --> 27:25.000
You've got to style yourself as an adventurer who sometimes does math stuff.

27:25.000 --> 27:26.000
Ooh.

27:26.000 --> 27:27.000
Right?

27:27.000 --> 27:31.000
Do you think when Indiana Jones hands in his resume, it says at the top like professor?

27:31.000 --> 27:32.000
Bullshit.

27:32.000 --> 27:33.000
Archaeologist?

27:33.000 --> 27:34.000
No.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.000
Archaeologist?

27:35.000 --> 27:36.000
No.

27:36.000 --> 27:39.000
It says dude who shot a guy with swords.

27:39.000 --> 27:40.000
Indiana Jones.

27:40.000 --> 27:41.000
Nazi puncher.

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
Professional Nazi puncher.

27:43.000 --> 27:44.000
Sad math girl.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.000
Wait, what's that?

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
Your only job is for an archaeologist?

27:47.000 --> 27:50.000
Yeah, I guess I'll take it.

27:50.000 --> 27:51.000
Exactly.

27:51.000 --> 27:52.000
Exactly.

27:52.000 --> 27:53.000
You want someone on the team.

27:53.000 --> 27:54.000
Not someone who's good at math.

27:54.000 --> 27:58.000
Someone who's good at adventure.

27:58.000 --> 27:59.000
Hey.

27:59.000 --> 28:02.000
Speaking of studies.

28:02.000 --> 28:05.000
Here's a Yahoo Answers question.

28:05.000 --> 28:11.000
It comes to us from Tweeler H.

28:11.000 --> 28:12.000
Who asked?

28:12.000 --> 28:17.000
It's very scientific too, so try not to laugh because it is scientific.

28:17.000 --> 28:21.000
Why do women like to eat men's diarrhea?

28:21.000 --> 28:22.000
In parentheses.

28:22.000 --> 28:23.000
Gender studies.

28:23.000 --> 28:24.000
Check, please.

28:24.000 --> 28:25.000
Justin.

28:25.000 --> 28:26.000
Check, please.

28:26.000 --> 28:27.000
I'm out.

28:27.000 --> 28:28.000
Hey, guys.

28:28.000 --> 28:29.000
I'm cashing out.

28:29.000 --> 28:30.000
Listen.

28:30.000 --> 28:31.000
I'm done.

28:31.000 --> 28:32.000
Blast my bim bam.

28:32.000 --> 28:33.000
Chill out.

28:33.000 --> 28:34.000
It's gender studies.

28:34.000 --> 28:35.000
Oh.

28:35.000 --> 28:36.000
Oh, it's science.

28:36.000 --> 28:37.000
It's parenthetical.

28:37.000 --> 28:38.000
It's gender studies, guys.

28:38.000 --> 28:39.000
Chill out.

28:39.000 --> 28:42.000
With a bonus, like into the video.

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
Two girls, one cup.

28:44.000 --> 28:45.000
Uh-huh.

28:45.000 --> 28:46.000
Well.

28:46.000 --> 28:51.000
Travis, you went to like four psychology classes.

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
Break it down for us.

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
Well, people are weird.

28:55.000 --> 28:59.000
That's all I got.

28:59.000 --> 29:04.000
So you went to psychology classes and obviously not gender studies classes.

29:04.000 --> 29:05.000
Yeah.

29:05.000 --> 29:06.000
No.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
Well, it's funny that this comes up.

29:08.000 --> 29:09.000
Stay with me here.

29:09.000 --> 29:10.000
I promise.

29:10.000 --> 29:11.000
Oh.

29:11.000 --> 29:16.000
Inevitably, whenever somebody sits around and starts listing off different random weird

29:16.000 --> 29:23.000
sexual terms like glass bottom boat and Cincinnati bow tie and things like that, the question

29:23.000 --> 29:26.000
always comes up, who actually does these things?

29:26.000 --> 29:27.000
Who does that?

29:27.000 --> 29:28.000
I don't think that that's true.

29:28.000 --> 29:32.000
And you're saying that people on the internet do that.

29:32.000 --> 29:33.000
People on the internet do that.

29:33.000 --> 29:37.000
If there's a phenomenon before the internet, no one did these things.

29:37.000 --> 29:42.000
But now you can't just fall off a table and expect to be internet famous.

29:42.000 --> 29:49.000
Is there any way that we can cut the internet out of the product that we make here at my

29:49.000 --> 29:50.000
Bim Bam Industries?

29:50.000 --> 29:54.000
So like we can bail out audio tapes.

29:54.000 --> 29:55.000
Like cassettes?

29:55.000 --> 29:56.000
Like individually.

29:56.000 --> 29:57.000
Yeah.

29:57.000 --> 29:58.000
I love that.

29:58.000 --> 29:59.000
Get churches to like store them on a wall.

29:59.000 --> 30:00.000
I love that too.

30:00.000 --> 30:01.000
Like different numbered.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.000
I really love that idea.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
It's just the internet makes me so uncomfortable.

30:04.000 --> 30:11.000
Like everything about it goes against everything that makes me uncomfortable.

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
It makes me afraid.

30:13.000 --> 30:20.000
I know you're a mathematician, but I see an entry on your resume here for gender studies

30:20.000 --> 30:26.000
specifically relating to why women like to eat men's diarrhea.

30:26.000 --> 30:27.000
Can you explain that a little bit?

30:27.000 --> 30:28.000
Hired.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
Was that your focus?

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
Was that your minor?

30:32.000 --> 30:33.000
You're hired.

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
Let's move on.

30:35.000 --> 30:36.000
I'm grossed out.

30:36.000 --> 30:39.000
I'm grossed out now.

30:39.000 --> 30:43.000
My girlfriend and I can never pick dinner easily.

30:43.000 --> 30:47.000
We've tried setting up alternating nights of who picks dinner, going through all our

30:47.000 --> 30:54.000
options together, and even picking out recipes and restaurants and assigning each one aside

30:54.000 --> 30:57.000
on a D20 and then roll for dinner.

30:57.000 --> 31:01.000
However, each night still ends up with a 30 minute conversation on what we eat regardless

31:01.000 --> 31:02.000
of our methods of choosing.

31:02.000 --> 31:06.000
Is there a better method to choose dinner?

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
Almost certainly.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
There has to be.

31:10.000 --> 31:14.000
Are we just doomed to an eternal existence of not knowing what we're going to eat?

31:14.000 --> 31:17.000
Or can the greatest advice Kaz let us know what to eat?

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
The peckish pear.

31:19.000 --> 31:22.000
That's the best one yet.

31:22.000 --> 31:25.000
The easiest way is what do you got?

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
Yeah, what do you got in the house?

31:27.000 --> 31:33.000
Because I tell you I'd love to eat steak every night, but most of the time I have frozen

31:33.000 --> 31:34.000
chicken rings.

31:34.000 --> 31:35.000
What the fuck?

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
It's not real.

31:37.000 --> 31:38.000
A chicken ring?

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
Get right out of town.

31:40.000 --> 31:41.000
Can you elaborate?

31:41.000 --> 31:46.000
It's like a chicken tender that has been bent into a circle.

31:46.000 --> 31:50.000
Just in case you want to wear it like a bracelet for snacking on the go?

31:50.000 --> 31:54.000
What you do is you stack them on your fingers like rings and then you eat them off while

31:54.000 --> 31:55.000
pretending to be Russian.

31:55.000 --> 31:56.000
That's horrifying.

31:56.000 --> 31:59.000
Whatever happened to that middle brother that used to be on that show?

31:59.000 --> 32:00.000
Didn't you hear?

32:00.000 --> 32:04.000
He ate chicken rings almost exclusively and died at the age of 29.

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
Here's the bad news.

32:06.000 --> 32:11.000
They've made me sick every time I've eaten them and I've bought three bags of them.

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
I just can't stop.

32:13.000 --> 32:20.000
We need to have one entire episode just solely about Travis's diet because it is haunting.

32:20.000 --> 32:21.000
Do you know what I ate yesterday?

32:21.000 --> 32:22.000
Tell me.

32:22.000 --> 32:25.000
I ate an entire bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken.

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
Christ on a bike.

32:27.000 --> 32:28.000
Travis.

32:28.000 --> 32:29.000
That's it.

32:29.000 --> 32:32.000
And then a Dr. Pepper and cookies and cream ice cream float.

32:32.000 --> 32:38.000
Tell everyone about your regular breakfast meal because that's the worst thing I've

32:38.000 --> 32:39.000
ever seen a human being consume.

32:39.000 --> 32:40.000
Like when I do a full breakfast?

32:40.000 --> 32:41.000
No, no, no, no.

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
Like your bagel.

32:43.000 --> 32:44.000
Your bagel monstrosity.

32:44.000 --> 32:47.000
My bagel monstrosity.

32:47.000 --> 32:55.000
Like when I do like an everything bagel with mustard and cheese and banana peppers and

32:55.000 --> 32:56.000
meat?

32:56.000 --> 32:57.000
Like that kind of thing?

32:57.000 --> 32:58.000
Yeah.

32:58.000 --> 33:01.000
That's a hearty breakfast and also lunch and dinner.

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
That's like an MRE that.

33:03.000 --> 33:04.000
Oh God.

33:04.000 --> 33:08.000
You skipped right past brunch to insanity.

33:08.000 --> 33:12.000
Somewhere along the line everyone loses that kind of childlike impulse where they just

33:12.000 --> 33:16.000
sit in the middle of a kitchen and say, I want to eat all of this.

33:16.000 --> 33:17.000
Let's do it.

33:17.000 --> 33:18.000
Let's go for it.

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
I have chosen to never lose that.

33:20.000 --> 33:26.000
So Pickish Pear, I think first you say, you just got to close things out.

33:26.000 --> 33:29.000
You got to say, do we want to go out or do we want to stay in?

33:29.000 --> 33:30.000
Okay.

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
That takes care of like a huge portion of those things.

33:32.000 --> 33:37.000
And then you think about what you've had in the past.

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
What did we have recently?

33:39.000 --> 33:44.000
And if that doesn't work, I always look at pictures of starving kids and I just eat the

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
first thing that's in front of me.

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
Which is usually a picture of a starving kid.

33:48.000 --> 33:49.000
Yeah.

33:49.000 --> 33:52.000
That's why you can't have a picture of a starving kid in our house because I'll look at it and

33:52.000 --> 33:57.000
just get so grateful and guilty about debating what I'm going to eat.

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
I just eat the first thing I say.

33:59.000 --> 34:05.000
Here's a method Teresa and I use, which is whoever feels like cooking gets to pick what

34:05.000 --> 34:06.000
we eat.

34:06.000 --> 34:10.000
So like if she doesn't want to cook and I do, we're going to eat whatever I want.

34:10.000 --> 34:14.000
If I don't feel like cooking and she does, we're going to eat whatever she wants.

34:14.000 --> 34:15.000
That's good.

34:15.000 --> 34:19.000
You could also use Travis's other method, which is to eat like you're going to commit

34:19.000 --> 34:22.000
suicide later that day.

34:22.000 --> 34:28.000
Skydiving, everything, bagel eating.

34:28.000 --> 34:33.000
I'm actually writing a movie called Eat, Pray, Love, Be Sad.

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
Eat, pray, love, cry yourself to sleep.

34:35.000 --> 34:39.000
Eat, nap, pray, nap, love.

34:39.000 --> 34:40.000
Disappointment.

34:40.000 --> 34:41.000
Cry.

34:41.000 --> 34:42.000
Sit on the toilet for four hours.

34:42.000 --> 34:45.000
My wife and I have been married for a little over three years.

34:45.000 --> 34:48.000
As we near our thirties, we are bombarded with questions dealing with having children

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
on a near constant basis.

34:50.000 --> 34:56.000
We had always said we'd have kids in the future, but as the said future gets close, we are

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
realizing we don't want to after all.

34:58.000 --> 35:02.000
We love our life, freedom, and knowing having children will change everything.

35:02.000 --> 35:05.000
It seems to be what society expects from a married couple.

35:05.000 --> 35:09.000
And when we mention our decision, they always try to change our minds or make us feel like

35:09.000 --> 35:10.000
we're making a mistake.

35:10.000 --> 35:15.000
How to respond to the criticism of others without having to justify our personal choice,

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
Travis and Megan.

35:17.000 --> 35:22.000
Okay, so Travis and Megan, if you get to, I'm a married guy, so I feel especially qualified

35:22.000 --> 35:23.000
in this.

35:23.000 --> 35:28.000
If you get to fifty, right, and you said, God, we screwed up.

35:28.000 --> 35:31.000
We should not have had, we should have had a kid.

35:31.000 --> 35:32.000
It's too late.

35:32.000 --> 35:33.000
You're all dried up.

35:33.000 --> 35:34.000
All dried up down there.

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
It's like a desert.

35:36.000 --> 35:40.000
But if you get to, so here's my suggestion.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
Have a kid.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
Just don't get like super invested.

35:44.000 --> 35:45.000
Yeah.

35:45.000 --> 35:46.000
Just keep it on the sidelines.

35:46.000 --> 35:47.000
Keep it on the sidelines.

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
Like I have a sideline kid.

35:49.000 --> 35:54.000
Maybe just like emotional, you can't, you can't put him in a freezer.

35:54.000 --> 35:55.000
No.

35:55.000 --> 35:56.000
But like emotional freezer.

35:56.000 --> 35:57.000
Treat him like a third roommate.

35:57.000 --> 35:58.000
Right.

35:58.000 --> 36:03.000
They will be, if you withhold love until your past childbearing age, they will be so desperate

36:03.000 --> 36:06.000
for that love or they will have moved out.

36:06.000 --> 36:11.000
But either way, you'll at least have your options open.

36:11.000 --> 36:19.000
I think, I think you're, you're denying the world of a little Tragen, which is what his

36:19.000 --> 36:20.000
name would be.

36:20.000 --> 36:21.000
Yeah.

36:21.000 --> 36:25.000
A Tragen with like really great taste in podcasts.

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
Here, here's my advice.

36:27.000 --> 36:31.000
Whenever you say to someone, I don't plan on having a kid and they say, why not just

36:31.000 --> 36:36.000
stone face, look them right in the eye and say, cause I'd kill it.

36:36.000 --> 36:37.000
Accidentally.

36:37.000 --> 36:38.000
Accidentally.

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
But like I don't trust myself to keep it alive.

36:40.000 --> 36:41.000
Oh my God.

36:41.000 --> 36:42.000
I have that thought.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.000
I have that thought on the reg.

36:43.000 --> 36:46.000
Like what if I actually did create offspring?

36:46.000 --> 36:51.000
That thing would be dead in like 60 days tops.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
They're like glass peaches.

36:53.000 --> 36:57.000
Those things like you gotta be super duper careful with that.

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
And I can't keep an iPhone without breaking it.

36:59.000 --> 37:05.000
I dropped, I dropped the same bagel yesterday morning three times before I got it to my

37:05.000 --> 37:06.000
desk.

37:06.000 --> 37:07.000
Three times.

37:07.000 --> 37:08.000
Everyone knows Griffin loves bagels.

37:08.000 --> 37:13.000
Travis dropped a bagel yesterday, but it was in horror of what he was about to do.

37:13.000 --> 37:14.000
I can't do this.

37:14.000 --> 37:15.000
I had a moment of clarity.

37:15.000 --> 37:18.000
Then Teresa's like, why are you picking your bagel up off the ground?

37:18.000 --> 37:22.000
My moment of clarity ended and I really want to eat this nightmare.

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
This Holocaust of a bagel I've created.

37:24.000 --> 37:28.000
I went to the store and they have bagel packages on sale like for a dollar.

37:28.000 --> 37:33.000
I bought 10 packages of bagels and I have eaten all of them.

37:33.000 --> 37:37.000
Traygen, Traygen, listen, you need to get in now.

37:37.000 --> 37:41.000
Um, under because you're, you're approaching this wire that if you don't get in under

37:41.000 --> 37:47.000
it, either you will have a baby when you're like 40 years old against the laws of science

37:47.000 --> 37:50.000
and God, or you'll adopt one.

37:50.000 --> 37:56.000
Uh, but either way you'll be the creepy old parents who everybody doesn't know if you're

37:56.000 --> 37:59.000
grandparents or what's the situation there.

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
Are you some sort of foster family?

38:01.000 --> 38:04.000
Did their real parents die in some sort of horrible accident?

38:04.000 --> 38:07.000
Um, you would think all that matters is that you're providing the child a loving home,

38:07.000 --> 38:08.000
but you'd be wrong.

38:08.000 --> 38:09.000
Not true.

38:09.000 --> 38:10.000
You gotta be sexy.

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
You gotta be sexy as fuck.

38:12.000 --> 38:13.000
Nope.

38:13.000 --> 38:17.000
No one's ever heard of a, of a, um, uh, um, milk.

38:17.000 --> 38:23.000
Like a mom I'd like to know and maybe learn some things about mom.

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
I'd like to hang out with mom.

38:25.000 --> 38:28.000
I'd like to chill with a milk.

38:28.000 --> 38:33.000
All I know is that what you definitely want to do is to make a decision you're not sure

38:33.000 --> 38:37.000
about and commit 18 years of your life at least to it.

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
Uh, don't have a kid.

38:39.000 --> 38:40.000
You don't want a kid.

38:40.000 --> 38:41.000
Don't do it.

38:41.000 --> 38:42.000
Do it.

38:42.000 --> 38:43.000
I know it is.

38:43.000 --> 38:49.000
I want to dip into something that Travis talked about a couple of shows ago, uh, but he finally

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
followed through for this week's episode.

38:51.000 --> 38:56.000
We, we use Yahoo Answers as a pretty constant source of, uh, comedy.

38:56.000 --> 39:03.000
Uh, Travis suggested we, we dip into Wiki Answers, which is apparently a very, uh, similar

39:03.000 --> 39:04.000
site.

39:04.000 --> 39:07.000
It advertises itself as the world's leading Q and A site.

39:07.000 --> 39:12.000
Um, only I, I'm seeing a lot of Q's and almost no A's.

39:12.000 --> 39:17.000
Uh, but Travis has picked a selection, uh, here that I'm just going to burn through really

39:17.000 --> 39:20.000
quick, um, if that's okay with you guys.

39:20.000 --> 39:21.000
Yep.

39:21.000 --> 39:22.000
Yep.

39:22.000 --> 39:27.000
Um, do you think that the members of B5 can tell when thick girls that are their fans

39:27.000 --> 39:32.000
get upset when they show the thin girls more love?

39:32.000 --> 39:37.000
What are some reasons why people decide to love in a particular?

39:37.000 --> 39:40.000
Who is Alison's enemy?

39:40.000 --> 39:45.000
Is suking cock dangaroos?

39:45.000 --> 39:48.000
When a man starts calling you sugar?

39:48.000 --> 39:52.000
Do not give any reason to make me feel jealous, for I might do a thing that you may regret

39:52.000 --> 39:56.000
for the rest of your life.

39:56.000 --> 40:04.000
What, which thing that dry measure two kilogram, wet one kilogram, and after burn three kilogram?

40:04.000 --> 40:08.000
Hey, Wiki Answers, what the fuck is going on on your website?

40:08.000 --> 40:13.000
At least Yahoo Answers are like coherent, like bugs in my vagina.

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
What pesticide is recommended?

40:15.000 --> 40:19.000
Real question that I was going to ask on the show, but decided not to, but just did.

40:19.000 --> 40:20.000
Like, but that's a thought.

40:20.000 --> 40:26.000
That's a complete thought, uh, that is positing a query that is answerable.

40:26.000 --> 40:32.000
My favorite on there just in like a meta way is, um, when a man starts calling you sugar.

40:32.000 --> 40:33.000
Yeah.

40:33.000 --> 40:34.000
Like that's not even a sentence.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
It's not even a sentence fragment.

40:36.000 --> 40:39.000
It's like, it's just a collection of words.

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
It doesn't mean anything.

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
In short, um, I don't think we can use Wiki Answers.

40:43.000 --> 40:50.000
I think it's the, I think it's this spiraling vermilion eye of madness that I just don't,

40:50.000 --> 40:54.000
I don't want to gaze into or else I'll lose who I am.

40:54.000 --> 40:58.000
So I want to, um, I want to hear the last question.

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
We have something to talk about really quick.

41:00.000 --> 41:06.000
Griffin, I heard you had maybe kind of a bad experience.

41:06.000 --> 41:12.000
Well, um, last week's episode, we talked quite a bit about, uh, the food stuffs.

41:12.000 --> 41:16.000
Not last week's, our bad.

41:16.000 --> 41:21.000
The food stuffs, if you can even call it that, uh, known as super donuts.

41:21.000 --> 41:28.000
Uh, I think the three of us were looking back on that particular food with, um, with rose

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
tinted goggles.

41:30.000 --> 41:35.000
I think that, uh, I think that maybe our memories of super donuts were sweeter than the actual

41:35.000 --> 41:42.000
food itself, uh, because I, I recently had, uh, or took part in a super donut party, uh,

41:42.000 --> 41:47.000
when I was back in Huntington visiting and holy shit, those things are so awful.

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
Um, what?

41:49.000 --> 41:50.000
They're so bad.

41:50.000 --> 41:51.000
Let me posit you this question.

41:51.000 --> 41:54.000
Is it possible they've changed the formula?

41:54.000 --> 41:59.000
I think it, it's very possible cause I don't remember them tasting like, uh, wiener-less

41:59.000 --> 42:05.000
corn dogs, which is the only way I can describe the flavor they're in, um, which if that sounds

42:05.000 --> 42:08.000
appealing to you, then you're a monster.

42:08.000 --> 42:11.000
It, it was, it was really bad.

42:11.000 --> 42:12.000
We even warmed them up.

42:12.000 --> 42:15.000
We microwaved them and we, we toasted them on a fire.

42:15.000 --> 42:18.000
Uh, neither method made them edible.

42:18.000 --> 42:25.000
Um, so that's my opinion on it, but, uh, we have a second opinion from close dear sweet

42:25.000 --> 42:29.000
friend of the show, Evan Minsker, which I'd like to read.

42:29.000 --> 42:33.000
Uh, Evan Minsker's, uh, super donuts at counterpoint.

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
Hello brothers McRoy, Evan Minsker here.

42:35.000 --> 42:39.000
After the last episode of my brother, my brother and me, the brothers Minsker decided to throw

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
a super donuts party at the Minsker family home.

42:41.000 --> 42:45.000
We procured the super donuts from S and J market in Barborsville, bought far too many

42:45.000 --> 42:49.000
of them, 27 donuts total, started a fire in the backyard, had beer and hot dogs.

42:49.000 --> 42:54.000
And of course the donuts upon eating the donuts, most of us learned that our nostalgia for

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
super donuts outweighed the actual taste.

42:56.000 --> 42:59.000
As Griffin put it, they taste like corn dogs without actual dogs inside.

42:59.000 --> 43:03.000
He informed everyone present that on this week's show, he would go on the record and

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
tell the world not to eat super donuts.

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
I, all of this is true so far.

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
I have, I've done all of that.

43:09.000 --> 43:10.000
That's where I take issue.

43:10.000 --> 43:11.000
Okay.

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
So yes, they do taste like corn dogs on that point.

43:13.000 --> 43:14.000
I concede.

43:14.000 --> 43:17.000
But now that the party's over, I was left with approximately 16 super donuts.

43:17.000 --> 43:18.000
Yes.

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
That means I have to either eat all of them or give them away.

43:20.000 --> 43:25.000
So here I am doing God's work, eating super donuts every effing day until I run out.

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
But there's a twist to this story.

43:27.000 --> 43:31.000
I become acclimated to the corn dog with a hint of cinnamon taste.

43:31.000 --> 43:35.000
I think I've gotten in touch with my inner elementary schooler and alas, I think they're

43:35.000 --> 43:36.000
terrific.

43:36.000 --> 43:37.000
Fun fact.

43:37.000 --> 43:41.000
Did you know that a super donut fulfills the USDA requirement for a fruit or vegetable

43:41.000 --> 43:42.000
as well as a bread?

43:42.000 --> 43:43.000
It's true.

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
And they're full of vitamins.

43:45.000 --> 43:46.000
Oh man.

43:46.000 --> 43:47.000
There are so many vitamins.

43:47.000 --> 43:51.000
They have to print the ingredients on a transparent background, making it impossible to see what

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
it is that you're actually ingesting.

43:53.000 --> 43:54.000
So brothers, I say this.

43:54.000 --> 43:57.000
If you're going to tell listeners not to eat super donuts, make one amendment.

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
Don't just eat one super donut.

43:59.000 --> 44:03.000
Buy 27 and be forced to eat about 16 of them.

44:03.000 --> 44:08.000
The nostalgia and deliciousness and heartburn will kick in after donut six.

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
The shame kicks in around 12.

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
God bless, Evan Winsker.

44:12.000 --> 44:15.000
So Evan, thank you for that heartfelt.

44:15.000 --> 44:20.000
Evan proves a rule, something I've always believed that if you expose yourself to anything

44:20.000 --> 44:26.000
enough, your opinion on it will reverse.

44:26.000 --> 44:30.000
I think he's got super donut Stockholm syndrome, and I think that they taste worse than AIDS

44:30.000 --> 44:34.000
and no one should ever eat them ever.

44:34.000 --> 44:37.000
I think that's probably stretching it.

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
I bought one on eBay, so we'll see how that went.

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
Did you really?

44:41.000 --> 44:42.000
Hell no.

44:42.000 --> 44:43.000
What?

44:43.000 --> 44:44.000
Buy donuts on eBay.

44:44.000 --> 44:45.000
Evan actually gave me a big...

44:45.000 --> 44:49.000
There's a box of them sitting next to the bonks at my local gas station.

44:49.000 --> 44:50.000
I plan on eating one.

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
Did you say next to the dongs?

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
Yeah, next to the dongnads.

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
I just...

44:56.000 --> 45:00.000
They're the worst food I've ever consumed.

45:00.000 --> 45:06.000
Evan gave me a bag of them to give to you guys, and I forgot, for which you're welcome.

45:06.000 --> 45:10.000
Is it possible that they are both the best and worst food you've ever consumed?

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
Because like 12 years ago, they were totally the best food.

45:12.000 --> 45:15.000
Yeah, they were really good 12 years ago.

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
Maybe they're just the same ones.

45:17.000 --> 45:18.000
So they fermented.

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
They stopped making them in like 1993.

45:20.000 --> 45:21.000
Exactly, exactly.

45:21.000 --> 45:22.000
These are really good fresh.

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
Yeah, but 12 years later.

45:24.000 --> 45:27.000
So I want to hear Griffin's last question, but first I want to thank you.

45:27.000 --> 45:28.000
Thank you.

45:28.000 --> 45:29.000
Thank you for hanging in with us.

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
Thank you for allowing us to take a week off to recharge.

45:31.000 --> 45:37.000
Sometimes we need that time to ourselves to become smart again because we let all our

45:37.000 --> 45:42.000
smart go every week through the microphones, then we have to get it back.

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
So thank you for that.

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
Thank you to everyone who has purchased t-shirts.

45:46.000 --> 45:49.000
There are still plenty of t-shirts available.

45:49.000 --> 45:55.000
If you would like to purchase them, you can check that out on nbmbam.com.

45:55.000 --> 46:01.000
There's still a facelift coming there, so make sure to get up on that.

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
We also have an app.

46:03.000 --> 46:07.000
There's also available on the buy stuff link on our website.

46:07.000 --> 46:10.000
It's called the My Brother, My Brother, Me app experience.

46:10.000 --> 46:14.000
It's got some goofy stuff on there.

46:14.000 --> 46:20.000
And plus you can listen to every episode of the show straight from your phone, which is super nice.

46:20.000 --> 46:26.000
But I would like to throw out a special thanks to the guy at PAX that told Justin I was his favorite.

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
Yeah.

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
Hey dude at PAX, you're my favorite.

46:30.000 --> 46:36.000
And I also want to say thank you to JJ Holder who is the only person I saw at PAX wearing

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
a My Brother, My Brother, Me t-shirt.

46:38.000 --> 46:43.000
And boy howdy did he ever get the hug of the century, my friend.

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
Wow.

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
We haven't given up our phone number in a while.

46:47.000 --> 46:50.000
It's 203-mbmbam1.

46:50.000 --> 46:53.000
That's 203-mbmbam1.

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
Give that a ring.

46:55.000 --> 47:00.000
We've actually gotten a couple calls over the past week or so.

47:00.000 --> 47:04.000
But before that it had been like a month since our last telephone call.

47:04.000 --> 47:05.000
So give that a ring.

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
We're not going to answer, we promise.

47:07.000 --> 47:17.000
Just leave us a message telling us about your day or ask for advice because we'll dip in there for advice.

47:17.000 --> 47:26.000
As always, we love seeing your quote tweets on the Twitter with the M-B-M-B-A-M hashtag and just generally spread the word.

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
A lot of people have been helping us out this week in our absence.

47:28.000 --> 47:35.000
Brentalfloss, Kappen underscore US, The Gamer Geek, Kate Nash.

47:35.000 --> 47:41.000
Tons of people have been just really telling people that the most important thing they can do is listen to the show.

47:41.000 --> 47:44.000
And that is true, has always been true, will always be true.

47:44.000 --> 47:45.000
Just tell a friend.

47:45.000 --> 47:48.000
Tell a friend.

47:48.000 --> 47:53.000
My good friend, John Mahaffey, he spreads the word as Johnny Mad Ass on Twitter.

47:53.000 --> 47:54.000
So follow him.

47:54.000 --> 47:55.000
Follow everybody.

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
Let's get a community going.

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
And don't forget to poke.

47:59.000 --> 48:00.000
Just get those pokes going.

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
Just get those pokes going.

48:02.000 --> 48:07.000
If you get a poke, the useless, useless poke, you'll know that somewhere a M-B-M-B-A-M fan cares about you.

48:07.000 --> 48:13.000
What I want to see is people poking people from the M-B-M-B-A-M appreciation group available on Facebook.

48:13.000 --> 48:16.000
There's also a link to that on our site.

48:16.000 --> 48:20.000
Don't just poke all the attractive ladies, though.

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
That's skeezy.

48:22.000 --> 48:27.000
Poke everyone, not just all the attractive femme fatales on the group.

48:27.000 --> 48:28.000
In fact, I want to say this.

48:28.000 --> 48:29.000
Everyone, poke my dad.

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
Don't fight it.

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
Poke Clint McElroy and poke Clint McElroy.

48:33.000 --> 48:34.000
Oh, my God.

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
Don't do that.

48:36.000 --> 48:37.000
That's weird.

48:37.000 --> 48:43.000
So, Griffin, I think poke your dad square on the lips.

48:43.000 --> 48:44.000
Oh, gross.

48:44.000 --> 48:47.000
So, Griffin, just stop it.

48:47.000 --> 48:48.000
You're the only one who can stop it.

48:48.000 --> 48:49.000
You've got to stop it.

48:49.000 --> 48:50.000
Okay.

48:50.000 --> 48:56.000
Let's shut this shit down with a Yahoo Answers question that was sent in by Eric.

48:56.000 --> 48:57.000
Thank you, Eric.

48:57.000 --> 49:06.000
This one comes to us by a Yahoo Answers user, Neutron Solstice, who asks,

49:06.000 --> 49:12.000
Does the blood of Jesus cover the sins of Neanderthals too or just Homo sapiens?

49:12.000 --> 49:17.000
How am I going to break through this?

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
I'm Justin McElroy.

49:19.000 --> 49:20.000
I'm Travis McElroy.

49:20.000 --> 49:21.000
I'm Griffin McElroy.

49:21.000 --> 49:26.000
This has been my brother, my brother, me, your dad, square on the lips.

49:26.000 --> 49:44.000
You will never know me.

49:44.000 --> 50:09.000
Jesus probably had a little Neanderthal in him, so, yes, it also covers 95% of every

50:09.000 --> 50:10.000
chimpanzee.

50:10.000 --> 50:14.000
They also share 95% genetic similarity with us.

50:14.000 --> 50:24.000
So, this answer is saying that 95% of chimp sins are washed away as well?

50:24.000 --> 50:25.000
Not the cardinals, no.

50:25.000 --> 50:29.000
Just the big ten.

50:29.000 --> 50:48.000
I think I read that somewhere in the Beatitudes, perhaps.
