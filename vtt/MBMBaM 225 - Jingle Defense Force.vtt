00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:48.480
Hello everybody, and welcome. My brother, my brother, me, an advice show for the modern era.

00:48.480 --> 00:52.480
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

00:52.480 --> 00:56.320
I'm your baby-est brother, Griffin fucking McElroy.

00:56.320 --> 01:02.400
Alert, alert. We are the Jingle All The Way defense team, and we are here to warn you

01:02.960 --> 01:09.920
that you or someone you love may at some point be exposed to Jingle All The Way 2.

01:10.720 --> 01:17.200
You know what, I'm sorry to admit it. I didn't have my defenses up. I had lowered

01:18.160 --> 01:22.400
the levels of my firewall on my computer, and I just found out that I've already been cast in

01:22.400 --> 01:28.640
Jingle All The Way 2. Shit. Man, don't make me choose between my brother and my jingle,

01:28.640 --> 01:35.760
because it's gonna be the jingle for sure. For sure, defo, 100%. Let's just say this,

01:35.760 --> 01:42.160
looking at the IMDb page of Jingle 2, and I'm making a list, and I'm checking it twice.

01:42.880 --> 01:47.760
Wait, Griffin, are you worried that they'll disrupt the canon of Jingle All The Way 1,

01:47.760 --> 01:51.920
that they'll ruin the integrity, or is it like you just hate Jingle All The Way 1

01:51.920 --> 01:57.120
so much you don't wanna see a sequel? Are you on fucking crystal meth?

01:58.000 --> 02:05.280
Jingle 1 is a fantastic film. It's my favorite Sinbad movie. And now these motherfuckers. I'm

02:05.280 --> 02:10.080
actually a little hoarse. I'm a little gravely right now, because I literally watched the 30

02:10.080 --> 02:17.440
second long trailer of Jingle 2, which shows Larry, the goddamn cable guy, which he hasn't

02:17.440 --> 02:23.040
done cable for a long time, so maybe it's time to revisit that nom de plume. Larry,

02:23.040 --> 02:28.400
the emeritus cable guy. The whole thing is the 30 second bit about how he plugs in crystal

02:28.400 --> 02:32.400
lights and it shocks him and it shoots him backwards. Real great stuff. I'm gravely,

02:32.400 --> 02:37.840
because I literally yelled, you motherfuckers, like that, and now I'm hoarse from it. So thanks

02:37.840 --> 02:44.960
for that. I've got choir practice here in 30 minutes. That's shot. Just wanna take a quick

02:44.960 --> 02:52.160
check on the description of this film. There's many good things about this, including the fact

02:52.160 --> 03:00.240
that it co-stars WWE superstar Santino Marella, but in the description of the trailer, Larry,

03:00.240 --> 03:05.840
the cable guy, is playing the role of Larry. Which I pointed out to Justin, he does in all

03:05.840 --> 03:12.000
of his fucking movies. It's never Larry, the cable guy, as Dr. Kenneth Hardstone.

03:12.000 --> 03:20.400
It's listed here in his credits, Larry, played by Larry, the cable guy, from Cars 1 and Cars 2.

03:22.080 --> 03:28.400
So you might see just from Cars and think, ah no, screw that guy. No, that's how deep they're

03:28.400 --> 03:34.240
willing to go into his back catalog that they are not even going to put their finger on, oh,

03:34.240 --> 03:41.840
I don't know, maybe Tooth Fairy 2? Another fucking disaster? Why not put him down as like,

03:41.840 --> 03:48.800
one of the blue collar comedy tour, like the thing that he is most known for?

03:48.800 --> 03:55.120
Red state hee haw boys. This motherfucker is trying to carve out a fucking earnest

03:55.120 --> 04:01.920
sized niche for himself with his goddamn Larry versus the aliens and secret service Larry.

04:02.560 --> 04:07.520
Griffin, when you said that Larry, the cable guy, is basically playing Larry,

04:07.520 --> 04:10.160
the cable guy in every movie. Did you think I was fucking joking?

04:10.160 --> 04:16.560
No, I mean, I know he is, but like, did you know that he's literally playing a character named Larry?

04:16.560 --> 04:17.760
Yes.

04:17.760 --> 04:21.360
2007, Delta Farce, Larry.

04:21.360 --> 04:22.000
Yep.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.720
Witless Protection, Deputy Larry's-

04:24.720 --> 04:40.480
Oh my god, Tooth Fairy 2, Larry Guthrie. Doug, it's his fucking brand. It's his brand, but you know what, it's also-

04:40.480 --> 04:43.360
He helps Tyler Perry for making him change it for a Madea Christmas. It might just be on the set,

04:43.360 --> 04:50.400
someone's like, he's playing a character called Buddy in Larry, the Cable Guy. I have to imagine

04:50.400 --> 04:57.120
on the set, someone's like, okay, now, Madea, now you're going to lean into Buddy. Wait a minute,

04:57.120 --> 04:59.280
my name's Larry. Yeah, yeah, no.

04:59.280 --> 05:00.320
Yeah, you are.

05:00.320 --> 05:05.280
Yeah, yeah. No, I'm Larry. No, but you're playing the role of Buddy. My name's Larry.

05:06.080 --> 05:07.360
This was such a mistake.

05:07.360 --> 05:10.080
Is it the same character in all of your movies?

05:10.080 --> 05:12.080
Oh my god, he is-

05:12.080 --> 05:18.480
Is it like an earnest level universe in which it's the Larry verse and he just exists as-

05:18.480 --> 05:26.400
It's the Larry verse and he is the observer. He crosses all planes, but he cannot interact with

05:26.400 --> 05:28.720
the human beings therein, and that's why he doesn't-

05:28.720 --> 05:35.040
The fabric of time is nothing to Larry. He can move seamlessly between every different plane

05:35.040 --> 05:35.920
of existence.

05:36.560 --> 05:41.840
Larry the Cable Guy is basically just a coalsaw-suckin' black adder. That's Larry the

05:41.840 --> 05:42.880
Cable Guy for you.

05:42.880 --> 05:48.800
He is the beginning and the ending. Everything is Larry, and Larry is all things.

05:48.800 --> 05:54.640
And now he's using his infinite power to fucking ruin Jingle 1.

05:54.640 --> 05:57.920
He is the alpha and the omega-ter-don.

05:57.920 --> 06:03.040
Oh, Jesus. I'm starting a Twitter campaign. I'm starting a Kickstarter campaign, a Patreon,

06:04.720 --> 06:09.760
just fucking everything, trying to get Simbat on board, and he hasn't answered me at the time of

06:09.760 --> 06:13.840
this recording, so I'm not going to call him a fucking coward, because maybe you will before

06:13.840 --> 06:18.240
this thing gets published, but Simbat, you know what you need to do, and you have my information.

06:18.240 --> 06:24.000
I reached out to Schwarzenegger, too, but I don't think he needs this as bad as Simbat,

06:24.000 --> 06:25.680
and I do, which is to say very badly.

06:25.680 --> 06:29.600
So we're going to continue to try to reach Simbat throughout the program, right?

06:30.240 --> 06:34.960
Yeah, oh God, yeah. Listen, I fucking lost the Battle for a Christmas Story, too.

06:34.960 --> 06:36.320
We all lost the Battle for a Christmas Story, too.

06:36.320 --> 06:37.280
We all lost that one.

06:37.280 --> 06:41.120
This is it. This is the final fucking line in the sand.

06:41.120 --> 06:42.240
This is our Normandy beach.

06:42.240 --> 06:47.200
This is it. If we can't do this, then what the fuck are we doing here?

06:47.200 --> 06:50.720
We're answering people's questions and turning them alchemy-like into wisdom.

06:50.720 --> 06:53.120
That's what we're doing. That's what we came to do.

06:54.080 --> 06:59.280
What's the right place to keep your ketchup? The pantry or the refrigerator?

06:59.280 --> 07:01.200
America's not the best country on earth anymore.

07:01.200 --> 07:10.480
The fucking fabric of our nation is eroding.

07:10.480 --> 07:15.040
Larry the Cable Guy fucking erasing Christmas off the calendar,

07:15.040 --> 07:18.480
and this fucking person even considering putting it in the pantry.

07:18.480 --> 07:19.280
Okay, wait, hold on.

07:19.280 --> 07:22.320
I just want to, for those of you not well versed in jingle all the way, too,

07:22.320 --> 07:30.400
it is jingle all the way, except they've swapped out Arnold Schwarzenegger and Simbat

07:30.400 --> 07:32.400
for two other people trying to find a gift.

07:32.400 --> 07:33.600
It's all sold out.

07:33.600 --> 07:34.640
Yeah, he wants to find it.

07:34.640 --> 07:36.400
He's on an adventure to find it.

07:36.400 --> 07:37.440
You're not calming me down.

07:37.440 --> 07:41.520
I need two dads in a no holds barred battle to be the best father

07:41.520 --> 07:43.520
and make this the best Christmas ever.

07:43.520 --> 07:47.040
Justin, I need you to make some ocean sounds for me or something.

07:48.720 --> 07:49.200
That's nice.

07:49.200 --> 07:50.960
Do you want me to talk to you in the ASMR?

07:51.520 --> 07:54.320
Yeah, no, nobody wants that ever again, actually, after last week.

07:56.480 --> 07:58.720
Finish the question, please. I'm dying.

07:58.720 --> 08:01.200
What are your mom and I wearing hockey pants?

08:02.800 --> 08:04.080
That is pretty much that.

08:04.080 --> 08:08.640
I mean, like you get it, Jess, but like his wife says helps to stay fresh longer.

08:09.200 --> 08:09.680
In the fridge.

08:09.680 --> 08:12.480
In the fridge, but he wants in the pantry because,

08:12.480 --> 08:14.400
wow, I don't want cold ketchup on my hot food.

08:14.400 --> 08:15.360
It's called contrast.

08:15.360 --> 08:15.680
Look up.

08:15.680 --> 08:16.160
You fucking eat in bulk.

08:16.160 --> 08:16.880
It's wonderful.

08:16.880 --> 08:17.840
It's the best.

08:17.840 --> 08:19.440
Ketchup isn't cold at restaurants.

08:19.440 --> 08:20.880
Why would I keep it cold at home?

08:20.880 --> 08:22.720
Yeah, everything at restaurants is fucking gross.

08:22.720 --> 08:25.520
Everything they have there for public, like sharing and consumption.

08:25.520 --> 08:30.560
If you see butter, open butter on a tray or a dish and you think like,

08:30.560 --> 08:34.240
ooh, they have exposed butter on a dish, that must mean this is a fancy restaurant.

08:34.240 --> 08:35.600
No, that means that's dirty butter.

08:35.600 --> 08:37.440
That means that's dirty two-year-old butter.

08:37.440 --> 08:38.640
Old dusty butter.

08:38.640 --> 08:39.360
Don't use that.

08:39.360 --> 08:40.480
You can use salt, I guess.

08:41.120 --> 08:42.720
I'm dusty butter.

08:42.720 --> 08:44.560
Thanks for coming to my roundup.

08:45.440 --> 08:49.680
Sing a few songs, maybe have a few good old gospel tunes

08:49.680 --> 08:51.520
and you're going to meet my whole family.

08:51.520 --> 08:56.320
Here's my little brother, Dusty Butters, and he's on the bench.

08:56.320 --> 08:57.440
Take it away, Dusty.

08:57.440 --> 08:57.840
What's it?

08:57.840 --> 08:58.240
Dusty?

09:00.400 --> 09:04.880
Just remember, here at Dusty Butters, the butter's been on the tables since 1958.

09:04.880 --> 09:06.560
Actually, my grandpa did it.

09:07.440 --> 09:11.520
Other than a few unpleasant races and outbursts, he's still my hero.

09:11.520 --> 09:13.680
And you can throw the butter right on the floor.

09:13.680 --> 09:18.160
Throw the butter on the floor, Dusty Butters.

09:18.160 --> 09:19.680
Don't let grandma slip.

09:19.680 --> 09:23.120
You'll want to stick around for the peanut butter roundup.

09:24.000 --> 09:24.800
That's a dessert.

09:26.320 --> 09:28.560
That also is served on the floor.

09:28.560 --> 09:29.360
Here's the thing.

09:29.360 --> 09:33.920
The restaurant's going to go through a bottle of ketchup a lot faster than you will.

09:34.480 --> 09:37.840
Especially if I roll around, because I'll turn that shit into dunkables.

09:38.640 --> 09:43.600
Yeah, I would love to see a scientific survey on the extent to which people

09:43.600 --> 09:50.240
will demolish a restaurant ketchup bottle, like just completely bathing their dish in

09:50.240 --> 09:54.560
ketchup versus at home when you're like, I don't know, I don't need that much.

09:55.120 --> 09:55.680
Right.

09:55.680 --> 10:00.480
I buy one of those giant Heinzers from the Costco, and I use it at a pace that is so

10:00.480 --> 10:06.080
slow that I could collect enough of that ketchup skin from the top of the bottle to form a child.

10:06.640 --> 10:08.960
I take this conundrum one step farther.

10:08.960 --> 10:14.560
And you know, those things that say how basically like every jar of everything says refrigerate

10:14.560 --> 10:18.320
after opening, I do not understand why you wouldn't just refrigerate it to begin with

10:18.320 --> 10:21.280
so that the first time you use it, it is also cold.

10:22.640 --> 10:25.920
Like if you don't refrigerate it till the first time you use it, it means the first

10:25.920 --> 10:27.120
time you use it, it's bad.

10:27.920 --> 10:29.120
So I'm weird about this.

10:29.120 --> 10:37.680
I will keep ketchup and mustard in the fridge, but like hot sauce, like a Buffalo sauce or

10:37.680 --> 10:45.840
a like a hot sauce I'll keep in the pantry except for sriracha, which I keep in the refrigerator.

10:45.840 --> 10:46.800
I'm just making it up.

10:46.800 --> 10:49.120
We're all playing Calvin ball with our fucking dippers, aren't we?

10:49.120 --> 10:50.720
No, I can justify that, Justin.

10:50.720 --> 10:53.040
Do you want to hear my theory on why you do that?

10:53.040 --> 10:53.280
Go.

10:53.280 --> 10:57.680
The mustard and the ketchup and the sriracha, they're all for dipping and topping.

10:57.680 --> 11:01.920
The hot sauce is for mixing into sauce that you put onto food and therefore bake it so

11:01.920 --> 11:03.040
it doesn't matter if it's cold.

11:03.760 --> 11:04.480
That's not true.

11:04.480 --> 11:05.680
I use Buffalo sauce for-

11:05.680 --> 11:06.480
Well then fuck.

11:06.480 --> 11:08.320
I don't know what you want me to do here, Justin.

11:08.320 --> 11:10.480
I'm trying to justify your weird behavior.

11:10.480 --> 11:11.840
Just put everything in the fridge.

11:11.840 --> 11:15.440
Just you spend a lot of money on that refrigerator.

11:15.440 --> 11:19.680
People spend a lot of time inventing it and it was designed to keep shit fresh.

11:19.680 --> 11:24.560
You know, Teresa and I in moving to L.A., we took like a refrigerator size downgrade

11:25.120 --> 11:29.680
and now we have to like it's a very like Sophie's Choice, like what goes in the fridge.

11:29.680 --> 11:31.840
It's not at all like Sophie's Choice.

11:31.840 --> 11:35.440
Well, I did just lose a full jar of pickles the other day because it got pushed off the

11:35.440 --> 11:37.120
top shelf by some leftovers.

11:37.120 --> 11:38.800
It made me real sad and it took 45 minutes to clean.

11:38.800 --> 11:39.840
But that made quite a mess.

11:41.520 --> 11:42.640
We were in quite a mess.

11:42.640 --> 11:43.360
Quite a pickle.

11:46.240 --> 11:47.040
Stop it.

11:47.040 --> 11:49.600
Are you also are you also writing jingle all the way too?

11:50.800 --> 11:51.200
I am.

11:51.200 --> 11:52.400
They gave me a good dill.

11:54.240 --> 11:55.280
Son of a bitch.

11:57.920 --> 11:58.800
You guys want a yahoo?

11:59.680 --> 12:00.000
Hold on.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.360
Wait, that joke wasn't kosher.

12:01.360 --> 12:02.480
Now do you guys want yahoo?

12:04.240 --> 12:04.800
Yeah, sure.

12:04.800 --> 12:05.280
Yes, please.

12:06.160 --> 12:07.440
Let me relish this for one second.

12:07.440 --> 12:08.640
Stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it.

12:08.640 --> 12:10.080
This yahoo was sent in.

12:10.080 --> 12:11.680
This is going to be a Vlasic episode.

12:11.680 --> 12:12.480
I can already tell.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.840
This yahoo was sent in by Rachel Sperling.

12:17.840 --> 12:18.880
Thank you, Rachel.

12:18.880 --> 12:22.720
It's by yahoo answers user Devin, who asks, Can you give me step?

12:22.720 --> 12:23.280
Oh, sorry.

12:23.280 --> 12:26.880
Can you gov me step by step instructions on smoking weed?

12:27.440 --> 12:29.040
I have no clue what to do.

12:29.680 --> 12:31.280
This is in general health care.

12:31.280 --> 12:36.000
I'm starting to, I'm starting to really get into how people categorize their yahoo barf.

12:36.000 --> 12:41.920
I mean, here's the thing.

12:41.920 --> 12:47.440
We laugh, but I kind of get where this dude is coming from.

12:47.440 --> 12:49.840
I mean, you got to be a bag of weed right now.

12:49.840 --> 12:51.440
I would not know what to do.

12:51.440 --> 12:55.120
I would probably end up making it in edibles because I would not know.

12:55.120 --> 12:56.080
You'd fuck that up too.

12:56.080 --> 12:57.760
That is an intense process, right?

12:57.760 --> 13:01.520
Yeah, because you got like boil it in olive oil and you got to extract it and you got

13:01.520 --> 13:03.920
to perform the sacred ritual.

13:04.720 --> 13:06.400
Wait, quick note for my nanny.

13:06.400 --> 13:11.200
I bet or so I'm told by the TV.

13:11.200 --> 13:16.400
It just seems to me like in this day and age, like I've never been, I, I, I just as I would

13:16.400 --> 13:20.080
not know how to raise chickens, I just know how to eat them.

13:20.080 --> 13:20.560
Sure.

13:20.560 --> 13:22.800
That is very much how I feel about marijuana.

13:22.800 --> 13:23.520
You bet.

13:23.520 --> 13:28.400
But like, I think it has, I think I've heard people say that you're only supposed to have

13:28.400 --> 13:36.160
the buds in air and not have the nugs buds or, well, then you take the nug and you turn

13:36.160 --> 13:39.200
it into a bud and by, by pruning it.

13:39.200 --> 13:42.240
So not all nugs are buds, but all buds are nugs.

13:43.040 --> 13:49.120
I, I, from what I understand, I bet it's like a broccoli, but you're not supposed to eat

13:49.840 --> 13:51.360
the tree trunk part.

13:51.360 --> 13:55.520
Um, only the leafy, uh, NugBuds, NugBuds.

13:55.520 --> 13:56.640
Well, it's all clear now.

13:57.440 --> 13:59.600
And then you first grind your nugs.

14:00.400 --> 14:05.120
You're going to need a food processor with a very fine settings and you got to do like,

14:05.120 --> 14:09.200
I don't know, man, like two cups at a time.

14:09.200 --> 14:12.960
And what most people don't know you is there's not a very good like ratio to this.

14:12.960 --> 14:16.480
So you start with like a pound and you end up with like half an ounce.

14:16.480 --> 14:17.120
Yeah.

14:17.120 --> 14:18.880
There's a lot of like leftovers.

14:18.880 --> 14:21.360
Yeah, there's a lot of like leftovers you throw.

14:21.360 --> 14:22.960
It's like cotton candy basically.

14:22.960 --> 14:23.460
Yeah.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.680
Justin, you have that cotton candy machine.

14:25.680 --> 14:30.080
Would you think about, I don't know, that form of distillation?

14:31.040 --> 14:32.480
Uh, I'd give it a try.

14:32.480 --> 14:36.800
I'd have to add some sugar just to get a pleasant mouthfeel.

14:36.800 --> 14:37.600
I think.

14:37.600 --> 14:40.880
I don't think that weed would necessarily make great cotton candy by itself.

14:40.880 --> 14:43.760
Well, not unless you got that, um, that sweet grass.

14:44.480 --> 14:46.640
The last time I smoked weed.

14:48.080 --> 14:48.640
You bet.

14:48.640 --> 14:51.920
I watched riding the bus with my sister.

14:51.920 --> 14:53.520
Oh Justin, no.

14:54.320 --> 14:59.280
The movie, if you ever watched is wildly, wildly offensive.

15:00.000 --> 15:07.680
Um, I thought with the help of my friend weed, I thought that it was fucking touching.

15:09.920 --> 15:12.560
So I don't know if I could smoke weed again,

15:13.200 --> 15:17.440
because how do you top riding the bus with my sister?

15:17.440 --> 15:21.440
If someone told me that like the best potency you get from weed is to like,

15:21.440 --> 15:24.000
put it straight up your nose without any processing.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.040
I'd probably buy it.

15:25.600 --> 15:29.840
Especially if this were like nine, if I was like 21 and they were like,

15:29.840 --> 15:30.560
Oh no, no, no.

15:30.560 --> 15:33.760
You just, you sit on it and that's how you, then you'll get high.

15:33.760 --> 15:35.920
I'll be like, Oh, okay.

15:35.920 --> 15:36.560
Yeah.

15:36.560 --> 15:42.240
Are you guys secretly hoping that marijuana does not become legal on a,

15:42.240 --> 15:43.120
on a national level?

15:43.120 --> 15:46.560
Because then you'll be like, Oh yeah, guys, did you, uh, did you hear the great news?

15:46.560 --> 15:51.520
I can't wait to get all of those, uh, nugs and then tear them up and then put them in

15:51.520 --> 15:52.880
paper and smoke them like a cigarette.

15:53.680 --> 15:57.760
I'm, I mostly don't want it to become legal because it's the one thing I'll have to tell

15:57.760 --> 16:01.360
my kids about that might make me seem cool a little bit.

16:01.360 --> 16:01.600
Yeah.

16:02.320 --> 16:02.800
Yeah.

16:02.800 --> 16:05.280
It's like the only taboo thing I've ever done.

16:05.280 --> 16:07.280
That's like, well, you know, I was like, fuck it.

16:07.280 --> 16:08.080
And I did it.

16:08.080 --> 16:11.520
And like in 20 years, my kids would be like, yeah, I'm doing it right now.

16:11.520 --> 16:11.680
Yeah.

16:11.680 --> 16:12.000
I'm doing it.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.160
Hey, open your eyes, old man.

16:14.160 --> 16:17.680
I just got home from school and I'm going to four 20 blaze it.

16:17.680 --> 16:21.840
So graham crackers and orange juice and some nugs for snack time.

16:21.840 --> 16:22.480
I don't get it.

16:22.480 --> 16:23.280
What's the big deal?

16:23.280 --> 16:24.480
I don't understand.

16:24.480 --> 16:27.360
My guidance counselor said it might help show me out.

16:27.360 --> 16:28.720
And he gave me some cool records.

16:30.480 --> 16:31.360
There's another question.

16:31.920 --> 16:34.640
How do you politely ask someone to stop using your Netflix account?

16:35.360 --> 16:39.920
When I first signed up, I let my friend who was very vocal about her financial difficulties

16:39.920 --> 16:40.640
user for free.

16:40.640 --> 16:49.840
I had no problem with it since we were in college and she ended up becoming my roommate

16:49.840 --> 16:50.800
slash best friend.

16:50.800 --> 16:53.840
Four years later, we both have full time jobs.

16:53.840 --> 16:57.440
Yet she still uses my account and even jokes about how she's mooching off me.

16:57.440 --> 17:00.880
I know it's a really small amount of money, but it still bothers me.

17:00.880 --> 17:03.760
She has no plans to get her account.

17:03.760 --> 17:07.040
Now that we're both adults, am I just being selfish and stingy?

17:07.040 --> 17:11.120
That's from the Scrooge McDuck of Netflix streaming.

17:12.160 --> 17:14.560
I mean, on the one hand, it's not like she's using it up.

17:15.280 --> 17:18.960
Yeah, I mean, does Netflix have that thing where only one person can be using it on one

17:18.960 --> 17:20.000
platform at a time or?

17:20.720 --> 17:21.440
I don't think so.

17:21.440 --> 17:22.720
I don't think so.

17:22.720 --> 17:24.320
I have.

17:24.320 --> 17:28.720
Okay, I share my Netflix account with Sydney's family.

17:28.720 --> 17:36.160
I do get a lot of like, did you want to watch some more Glee?

17:36.160 --> 17:37.040
No, thank you.

17:37.040 --> 17:39.280
Here's some recommendations for things that are likely.

17:39.280 --> 17:39.840
I'm fine.

17:39.840 --> 17:40.160
Thanks.

17:40.800 --> 17:44.800
But in this day and age, you can create different profiles like Teresa and I have separate profiles

17:44.800 --> 17:46.880
that we don't get that we are crossover.

17:46.880 --> 17:52.640
That's a new development like watching weird British horror movies and also animated children's

17:52.640 --> 17:53.520
features.

17:53.520 --> 17:54.800
I'm worried about you.

17:54.800 --> 17:56.320
I've already been contaminated, though.

17:56.320 --> 17:58.160
It already has that in its files for me.

17:59.840 --> 18:05.200
You could watch all five seasons of The Wire and it would still be like, I listen.

18:05.200 --> 18:08.160
Are you ever going to get back on that singing high schooler tip?

18:08.160 --> 18:09.440
Could you?

18:09.440 --> 18:10.400
Hi, I have it.

18:11.520 --> 18:21.040
You need to harness the power of your Netflix by watching the most reprehensible content

18:21.600 --> 18:26.800
you possibly can until your friend no longer wants to be associated with you.

18:26.800 --> 18:30.880
I noticed that you watched all five seasons of my strange eating addiction.

18:32.080 --> 18:33.920
Maybe this isn't working out.

18:33.920 --> 18:35.360
Maybe we can't share this anymore.

18:35.360 --> 18:35.920
Oh, my shit.

18:35.920 --> 18:38.160
I just figured out how we use this to get famous.

18:38.160 --> 18:43.520
More like more like the snuff films you've been watching, looking for something goofy

18:43.520 --> 18:46.240
and where somebody gets murdered for real in real life.

18:46.240 --> 18:47.200
And they filmed it.

18:47.200 --> 18:48.000
You might like this.

18:48.880 --> 18:54.240
We need to make a movie titled How to Tell Your Roommate Your Former Roommate Not to

18:54.240 --> 18:55.520
Use Your Netflix Anymore.

18:56.320 --> 18:57.520
And then how to tell.

18:57.520 --> 19:01.600
Yeah, just looking at it going, hey, stop it.

19:01.600 --> 19:04.080
And you only watch that repeatedly for a year.

19:04.080 --> 19:06.720
So that's the only thing showing up on your recently.

19:06.720 --> 19:12.240
How to murder somebody who is watching your Netflix.

19:12.240 --> 19:13.360
That might be too on the nose.

19:14.160 --> 19:15.360
The only person I know.

19:15.360 --> 19:16.240
You quit it.

19:16.880 --> 19:22.640
The only person I know that got something on Netflix is Hodgman got his special Ragnarok

19:22.640 --> 19:23.520
on there.

19:23.520 --> 19:25.440
So if you haven't watched that, go watch that.

19:25.440 --> 19:26.000
It's great.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.520
Ask him how he did it.

19:27.520 --> 19:35.680
I mean, there is some there is some poopy garbage on that fucking jingle to guaranteed

19:35.680 --> 19:38.560
going to be on the flicks this holiday season.

19:38.560 --> 19:39.920
I do not think it's that hard.

19:39.920 --> 19:41.440
I think we could probably swing this.

19:43.120 --> 19:46.720
Do you guys remember when we used to go into borders and we would go to the computers or

19:46.720 --> 19:52.000
search for things and we would search for like how to blow up a border and then leave?

19:52.000 --> 19:57.680
That was a simpler time.

19:57.680 --> 20:00.320
Oh, God, that was really impact shenanigans.

20:00.320 --> 20:01.760
That was a whoof.

20:03.360 --> 20:05.360
That was that was the 90s, folks.

20:05.360 --> 20:06.320
It was the 90s.

20:06.320 --> 20:07.360
It was different.

20:07.360 --> 20:08.880
It was a different time.

20:08.880 --> 20:11.120
It was a different it was very different.

20:11.120 --> 20:12.800
I think it was the main thing I could say.

20:14.160 --> 20:17.040
Why you change your password and say you canceled it?

20:17.600 --> 20:18.560
No, that's pretty good, too.

20:18.560 --> 20:22.000
And then ask if you can use her Netflix that she starts because you are not you don't

20:22.000 --> 20:23.440
have the finances for it.

20:24.960 --> 20:25.760
Do you guys want to Yahoo?

20:27.280 --> 20:29.760
This Yahoo was also sent in by Rachel Sperling.

20:29.760 --> 20:30.560
Thank you, Rachel.

20:30.560 --> 20:32.320
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

20:34.720 --> 20:37.120
I think that they have been deleted.

20:38.320 --> 20:42.880
They asked me and my boyfriend are both emo.

20:43.680 --> 20:46.240
Does that mean our children will be emo, too?

20:46.240 --> 20:47.040
I didn't know.

20:47.040 --> 20:52.960
I didn't know that particular people group and no judgment still existed.

20:53.760 --> 20:54.720
Still around.

20:54.720 --> 21:01.680
If my grandfather was a quarter goth and my grant and my mean, my Meeps was straight edge.

21:03.680 --> 21:05.120
They have four kids.

21:05.120 --> 21:06.880
Two of them will definitely be emo.

21:06.880 --> 21:11.840
One of them will be a straight edge goth, and one of them will be president of the United

21:11.840 --> 21:12.640
States.

21:12.640 --> 21:16.560
Guys, we just fucking invented an America's Next Top Model challenge right now.

21:18.560 --> 21:21.920
I mean, maybe I listen genetics.

21:21.920 --> 21:26.400
I listen to this really fascinating episode of Radio Lab on RNA and it makes you know.

21:26.400 --> 21:26.900
Come on.

21:28.240 --> 21:28.740
Hey, who am I?

21:29.760 --> 21:30.260
Everybody.

21:31.760 --> 21:34.560
I do actually listen to Radio Lab to fall asleep on long plane rides.

21:35.440 --> 21:36.320
It's a great show, though.

21:36.320 --> 21:40.160
And anyway, they're talking about RNA and how it just and just makes you feel like you're

21:40.160 --> 21:43.600
and anyway, they're talking about RNA and how it just informs so many different parts

21:43.600 --> 21:43.920
of your life.

21:43.920 --> 21:48.800
And you probably have like a few TCAGs in there that are just like, hey, hey, hey, guess

21:48.800 --> 21:49.200
what?

21:49.200 --> 21:50.720
You like panic at the disco.

21:51.360 --> 21:55.280
So I don't see why you couldn't pass that along to your spawn.

21:55.280 --> 21:57.920
Can you picture 40 year old emo people?

21:57.920 --> 21:58.420
Yes.

21:59.040 --> 21:59.540
Yeah.

21:59.920 --> 22:01.360
What do you think they look like?

22:01.360 --> 22:02.000
Gene Simmons.

22:07.680 --> 22:08.800
Robert Smith, right?

22:08.800 --> 22:11.120
But he's like, yeah, I guess he's legit.

22:11.120 --> 22:12.000
It's pro demo.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.720
Yeah, I what is norm core?

22:15.760 --> 22:24.800
That's like it's like people just like it's it's the razzle dazzle of cultural groups

22:24.800 --> 22:26.640
of people that are just wearing some jeans.

22:27.760 --> 22:30.080
OK, so wait, it's just like normal.

22:30.720 --> 22:31.220
Yeah.

22:32.080 --> 22:33.520
And then they put a label on it.

22:36.640 --> 22:38.000
Maybe it's a little bit too normal.

22:38.000 --> 22:41.760
And it's like, oh, yeah, I'm eating my oatmeal.

22:41.760 --> 22:45.040
I might put some cinnamon on it because it's Saturday.

22:45.040 --> 22:46.560
It's like we fucking all right.

22:46.560 --> 22:47.600
We get it.

22:47.600 --> 22:49.040
Like John Green, right?

22:49.040 --> 22:50.640
What's that guy up to?

22:50.640 --> 22:52.320
What are you planning, John Green?

22:53.120 --> 22:57.920
And your pleasant shirt and your affable, your affable personality.

22:57.920 --> 22:58.880
What are you up to?

22:58.880 --> 22:59.760
That's the problem.

22:59.760 --> 23:02.320
He's he's actually just a pleasant affable person.

23:02.320 --> 23:06.800
And he's just a little too likable, a little too likable.

23:08.080 --> 23:13.360
The fact that you know his name means he's he's he's been pushed out only because I've

23:13.360 --> 23:14.960
been keeping my eye on him.

23:14.960 --> 23:15.460
Yeah.

23:16.000 --> 23:19.520
The fact that there was something there's something there to keep an eye on.

23:19.520 --> 23:24.080
Let me let me ask you if you've ever heard of this person, John Horkinson.

23:24.880 --> 23:26.160
No, I don't.

23:26.160 --> 23:26.880
I haven't.

23:26.880 --> 23:28.720
You say you guys just don't know the fucking scene.

23:29.360 --> 23:31.600
Here's why I don't trust John Green.

23:31.600 --> 23:35.040
This is a multi-part point, but it's really just the one.

23:35.600 --> 23:37.920
John Green wrote The Fault in Our Stars.

23:38.480 --> 23:42.400
Before he wrote The Fault in Our Stars, he was making videos on YouTube.

23:43.200 --> 23:49.120
After The Fault in Our Stars movie came out, he was still making videos on YouTube.

23:49.120 --> 23:53.760
If I wrote The Fault in Our Stars, I would never be on YouTube again.

23:54.560 --> 23:56.640
You would have to come find me.

23:56.640 --> 24:00.080
Somebody in YouTube headquarters has dirt on John Green.

24:00.080 --> 24:04.000
Somebody there had I would know what YouTube like on computers.

24:04.560 --> 24:04.960
Sorry.

24:04.960 --> 24:10.400
Call me back when you're Steven Spielberg because I wrote The Fault in Our Stars.

24:10.400 --> 24:13.760
Oh, I'm actually rich and famous enough to use the rich and famous Internet that only

24:13.760 --> 24:15.360
rich and famous people are allowed to use.

24:15.360 --> 24:16.080
Yeah.

24:16.080 --> 24:16.560
Yeah.

24:16.560 --> 24:19.680
A true true American dog is still updated on it.

24:19.680 --> 24:22.000
I've been watching new Strong Bad videos for years.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.560
On the deep, the deep, deep John Green webs.

24:26.560 --> 24:30.880
My girlfriend recently got a job as an administrative assistant at a financial firm.

24:30.880 --> 24:33.200
At the end of the day, we always exchange stories about our day.

24:33.200 --> 24:37.680
The problem is her days and those stories are now really, really boring.

24:38.720 --> 24:43.280
She used to be a teacher and waitress and would have funny bits about students or goofy

24:43.280 --> 24:44.080
customers.

24:44.080 --> 24:48.240
Yesterday, on the other hand, I had to sit there 15 minute epic about some papers that

24:48.240 --> 24:50.480
she misplaced and had to track down.

24:51.600 --> 24:55.440
I love her very much, but office stories are even more boring than dreams.

24:55.440 --> 24:56.720
How do I tell her?

24:56.720 --> 25:00.000
And that's from Inattentive in Illinois.

25:00.000 --> 25:05.120
I really liked Girlfriend, but I feel like it went downhill and like series three when

25:05.120 --> 25:10.960
Aaron Sorkin left and everybody started working at a financial firm just didn't have the

25:10.960 --> 25:11.520
same pop.

25:13.040 --> 25:17.920
Oh, boy, you've misplaced the you've misplaced one report too many.

25:17.920 --> 25:18.800
Shut it down.

25:18.800 --> 25:20.640
What happened to this fucking show?

25:22.640 --> 25:24.240
Here's the here's the facts, dude.

25:24.240 --> 25:28.640
Like, she's not telling you her stories to entertain you like that.

25:28.640 --> 25:31.680
She's telling you her stories to tell you about her dad.

25:31.680 --> 25:33.280
And this is a universe.

25:33.280 --> 25:37.760
Nobody ever tells work stories to entertain anyone unless you're like you have a fucking

25:37.760 --> 25:43.360
super dope life and you're like you're like, I don't know, Steve Buscemi's personal

25:43.360 --> 25:43.920
assistant.

25:43.920 --> 25:47.440
I bet you get lots of delicious dirt pies from that.

25:48.400 --> 25:49.120
And that's the thing.

25:49.120 --> 25:50.320
Like, what's she going to do?

25:50.320 --> 25:52.160
Come home and just be like, hey, how was your day?

25:52.160 --> 25:54.800
You go, I've got nothing like she's going to tell you because this is what she did in

25:54.800 --> 25:55.280
the day.

25:55.280 --> 25:57.280
And it's your job to go, oh, really?

25:57.280 --> 25:58.080
You found the papers.

25:58.080 --> 25:58.880
Well, that's good.

25:58.880 --> 26:01.040
Like, that's your that's what you're supposed to do.

26:01.040 --> 26:03.360
You're not going to spice it up.

26:04.000 --> 26:10.880
I I would say that my job is is very boring to tell stories from.

26:10.880 --> 26:16.240
And but I have I generally attempt to spare Sidney.

26:16.240 --> 26:20.720
I mean, yeah, I think I like I don't say like, well, I don't want to tell stories.

26:20.720 --> 26:29.280
I don't say like, well, I stared at a collection of LEDs in a box for eight hours and got eight

26:29.280 --> 26:30.000
hours older.

26:30.000 --> 26:35.520
And then I pushed a series of buttons on that that changed things on that screen.

26:35.520 --> 26:37.600
And I got probably doxxed.

26:37.600 --> 26:39.440
But other than that, like that's been my day.

26:39.440 --> 26:41.760
Well, there's an important thing here that he didn't say.

26:42.720 --> 26:44.480
How recently did she get it?

26:44.480 --> 26:50.560
Because if it's like three weeks, then she's going to now she's like six months, seven

26:50.560 --> 26:51.060
months in.

26:52.080 --> 26:54.160
Eventually, she'll go like, is it?

26:54.160 --> 26:54.560
I don't know.

26:54.560 --> 26:57.280
It was another day where, like, I was trying to find papers.

26:57.280 --> 26:58.160
What did you do?

26:58.160 --> 27:01.360
Like, if it's really early on, of course, she's going to talk about it.

27:01.360 --> 27:03.520
She's got a new job and she's excited about it.

27:03.520 --> 27:07.600
You could challenge yourself to try to learn more about The Office.

27:08.160 --> 27:13.120
How many people in The Office can you learn their names and job titles and keep track

27:13.120 --> 27:14.720
of their various storylines?

27:14.720 --> 27:16.080
Ask for more info.

27:16.080 --> 27:17.120
Get on board.

27:17.120 --> 27:19.760
This could be your new season of The Office.

27:19.760 --> 27:21.840
This could be your new season of The Office.

27:21.840 --> 27:23.200
It's her office.

27:23.200 --> 27:26.000
Here's another option for you that I just came up with.

27:26.000 --> 27:27.520
Thank you, Brandy.

27:28.640 --> 27:29.600
The new option-

27:29.600 --> 27:30.480
The singer, Brandy?

27:31.200 --> 27:31.920
Thank you, Brandy.

27:31.920 --> 27:32.720
She's here in my office.

27:32.720 --> 27:33.920
She just whispered this in my ear.

27:33.920 --> 27:37.040
She said, what if the next time?

27:38.560 --> 27:43.760
What if you stay so busy that you never have time for work stories again?

27:44.320 --> 27:46.720
Maybe she starts on a work story and you're like, hold on.

27:47.680 --> 27:49.200
Hold on, my queen.

27:49.200 --> 27:50.320
My world, my everything.

27:51.120 --> 27:53.440
Get in the back of this limousine.

27:53.440 --> 27:55.520
We're going to the museum.

27:56.320 --> 27:58.480
And you just like make memories.

27:58.480 --> 27:59.840
So many memories together.

27:59.840 --> 28:01.520
Okay, let me challenge you right now.

28:01.520 --> 28:03.280
Every day you have something planned.

28:03.280 --> 28:06.800
Let me challenge you right now to come up with three more memories on the spot.

28:06.800 --> 28:07.120
Go.

28:07.120 --> 28:08.640
You did limo to museum.

28:08.640 --> 28:08.960
Go.

28:08.960 --> 28:10.000
Limo to museum.

28:10.720 --> 28:12.640
Because this guy's going to be feeling more pressure than this.

28:12.640 --> 28:13.440
Go, Justin.

28:13.440 --> 28:14.800
Go, go, go.

28:14.800 --> 28:16.960
Laser tag with kids from the city mission.

28:16.960 --> 28:17.440
Terrific.

28:17.440 --> 28:18.080
Next, two.

28:18.080 --> 28:18.880
Two.

28:18.880 --> 28:21.280
Gift wrapping at the mall, raising money for charity.

28:21.280 --> 28:22.720
You could talk during that.

28:22.720 --> 28:23.920
You can't talk during laser tag.

28:23.920 --> 28:24.480
We'll give you that one.

28:24.480 --> 28:26.240
But over present wrapping, you could-

28:26.240 --> 28:29.040
You also can't talk in the limousine to the museum.

28:29.040 --> 28:30.320
Shh, it's quiet.

28:30.320 --> 28:31.200
Skydiving.

28:31.200 --> 28:32.000
Skydiving?

28:32.000 --> 28:32.320
Okay.

28:32.320 --> 28:35.040
Are you just about to do the fucking lyrics to that goddamn song?

28:35.600 --> 28:37.680
No, I don't know what song you're talking about.

28:37.680 --> 28:39.520
You could go to a Tim McGraw concert.

28:39.520 --> 28:41.200
You cocksucker.

28:43.520 --> 28:44.320
Be too loud.

28:44.320 --> 28:45.600
What is your job?

28:46.400 --> 28:46.960
What do you do?

28:46.960 --> 28:48.800
Yeah, what's your fucking gig?

28:48.800 --> 28:49.600
What do you do?

28:49.600 --> 28:51.200
He's a skydiving museum employee.

28:53.360 --> 28:55.440
I work at the skydive museum.

28:55.440 --> 28:58.400
Oh, Frederick Henderson was the first person that was like,

28:58.400 --> 29:00.400
I'm going to jump out one in some bitches.

29:02.880 --> 29:04.960
If you look to your right, it's a plane door.

29:04.960 --> 29:05.680
Let's go.

29:05.680 --> 29:21.040
If you look to your right, it's a plane door, let's go.

29:21.040 --> 29:23.200
All right, so Justin, this week we have a new sponsor.

29:23.920 --> 29:25.040
Who's that?

29:25.040 --> 29:27.040
Well, it's a little company called Nature Box.

29:27.040 --> 29:30.240
And, you know, we said, well, let's give them a try.

29:30.240 --> 29:32.720
Well, they just put some twigs and some fucking dirt

29:32.720 --> 29:33.840
and a couple of butterflies on a box and-

29:33.840 --> 29:34.640
No, get this.

29:34.640 --> 29:36.000
It's snacks.

29:36.000 --> 29:36.480
Oh.

29:36.480 --> 29:37.280
It's like natural-

29:37.280 --> 29:38.640
You eat the butterflies?

29:38.640 --> 29:39.920
That are like good for you.

29:40.640 --> 29:41.760
You eat the butterflies?

29:42.480 --> 29:44.800
Yeah, you eat the butterflies instead of chips.

29:45.680 --> 29:47.600
It's a weird new thing that they're doing.

29:47.600 --> 29:50.240
You get a box full of butterflies once a month.

29:50.240 --> 29:53.440
They're offering a free box of them.

29:53.440 --> 29:56.800
Like, not that impressive considering they're butterflies.

29:56.800 --> 29:58.080
You could probably just go grab a-

29:58.080 --> 30:00.480
Oh, like you want to go to the trouble of catching the butterflies

30:00.480 --> 30:02.720
and making them into praline butterflies yourself.

30:02.720 --> 30:05.200
And actually, you know something, my friend Justin Mincer

30:05.200 --> 30:06.400
is getting married next week.

30:06.400 --> 30:08.560
I could buy like four or five boxes of these things

30:08.560 --> 30:10.080
and just like crack them open at the ceremony.

30:10.080 --> 30:11.600
What a wonderful surprise that would be.

30:11.600 --> 30:13.200
It's a multi-tasker.

30:13.200 --> 30:14.960
There's no butterflies in these snacks.

30:14.960 --> 30:16.720
They're delicious wholesome snacks,

30:16.720 --> 30:18.880
but they're like actual people food.

30:18.880 --> 30:22.480
They don't have added sugar in most of them,

30:22.480 --> 30:23.600
or not in most of them,

30:23.600 --> 30:25.120
but some of them don't have added sugar

30:25.120 --> 30:26.800
and some of them are without gluten ingredients.

30:27.680 --> 30:30.000
Most of them don't have butterflies.

30:30.000 --> 30:31.200
Nearly all of them.

30:31.200 --> 30:33.680
You have to look really hard to find the butterflies category.

30:33.680 --> 30:36.560
The sampler boxes that you can get for free

30:37.200 --> 30:40.640
by starting your free trial at naturebox.com slash my brother

30:40.640 --> 30:43.760
all in one word, naturebox.com slash my brother

30:43.760 --> 30:46.480
guaranteed, this is a McElroy brothers guarantee,

30:46.480 --> 30:47.760
won't have butterflies in them.

30:48.320 --> 30:49.520
Just larvae.

30:49.520 --> 30:50.880
Just let me feed you larvae.

30:51.840 --> 30:54.800
If you want to try these out, they've got the actual snacks

30:54.800 --> 30:57.280
like peanut butter nom noms, sweet potato fries.

30:58.560 --> 30:59.600
I'm trying to think, you know what?

30:59.600 --> 31:01.520
It's been a while since I've cracked open

31:01.520 --> 31:03.040
a fresh box of snacks.

31:03.040 --> 31:06.080
I need to re-up my list because I keep eating the same things.

31:06.080 --> 31:08.000
I know fresh toast granola is delicious.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.280
That's one that I very much enjoy.

31:10.320 --> 31:12.720
But anyway, you can get a box of sampler snacks.

31:12.720 --> 31:15.760
Just go to naturebox.com slash my brother.

31:16.560 --> 31:17.680
Stay full, stay strong.

31:17.680 --> 31:20.160
Go to naturebox.com slash my brother

31:20.160 --> 31:23.280
and get a free box of delicious snacks.

31:23.280 --> 31:24.960
Travis, tell me about Prosper.

31:24.960 --> 31:26.720
Prosper, well, they sponsored us before,

31:26.720 --> 31:28.400
so you should already know plenty about them,

31:28.400 --> 31:30.480
but they're a peer-to-peer lending group.

31:31.040 --> 31:34.080
Prosper.com, and basically it's if you need a car loan

31:34.080 --> 31:35.520
or you move across the country

31:35.520 --> 31:36.880
or you've got expensive dental work

31:36.880 --> 31:38.400
or something that you're looking for a loan for,

31:38.400 --> 31:39.920
but you don't want to go through a bank,

31:39.920 --> 31:40.960
Prosper is here to help.

31:40.960 --> 31:43.280
Basically, you go to Prosper, you say,

31:43.280 --> 31:46.160
I need anywhere between $2,500 and $35,000

31:46.880 --> 31:48.800
and you get a low fixed rate

31:49.360 --> 31:50.800
without ever sitting foot in a bank.

31:50.800 --> 31:53.280
And other people, other users of the site say,

31:53.280 --> 31:54.800
I'm going to invest in this person.

31:54.800 --> 31:56.240
This seems like a good deal.

31:56.240 --> 31:57.600
So some of their money goes to them

31:57.600 --> 31:59.200
and then they make money off of it.

31:59.200 --> 32:00.960
So it cuts off the middleman of the bank

32:01.840 --> 32:03.760
and it's a convenient way.

32:03.760 --> 32:08.000
It might be a more acceptable way for you.

32:08.000 --> 32:09.120
Maybe you don't like banks.

32:09.120 --> 32:11.040
Well, then Prosper.com is your option.

32:11.040 --> 32:13.120
And right now for a limited time,

32:13.120 --> 32:15.920
listeners of our show get a $50 visa gift card

32:15.920 --> 32:16.640
when you get a loan.

32:16.640 --> 32:19.200
So that's $50 free on top of your loan

32:19.840 --> 32:21.280
that you never have to pay back.

32:21.280 --> 32:23.040
Spend that on some nature boxes

32:23.040 --> 32:25.920
and then sell the contents of those nature boxes.

32:25.920 --> 32:27.760
And that's infinite money right there.

32:27.760 --> 32:31.520
Yeah, you could get up to $35,000 in your account

32:31.520 --> 32:34.480
in three days and a free $50 visa gift card

32:34.480 --> 32:37.120
if you go to Prosper.com slash my brother,

32:37.120 --> 32:39.520
Prosper.com slash my brother,

32:39.520 --> 32:42.000
get yourself a loan, get yourself a better life.

32:42.000 --> 32:44.960
Justin, I'm nervous to ask you to read the legal disclaimer

32:44.960 --> 32:47.040
because last time you did a Jimmy Buffett song.

32:47.040 --> 32:49.280
I'm hoping you're maybe Jimmy Buffett songed out

32:49.840 --> 32:54.720
after releasing your chart topping single on YouTube today.

32:54.720 --> 32:58.720
Yeah, I released a chart topping Jimmy Buffett cover.

32:58.720 --> 33:02.080
I would be lying if I said I didn't deeply enjoy it.

33:02.080 --> 33:02.880
Yeah, it's very good.

33:02.880 --> 33:03.920
It's super good.

33:04.560 --> 33:06.240
Thanks, I'm really glad you like it.

33:06.240 --> 33:09.120
That's at YouTube.com slash M-B-N-B-A-M

33:09.120 --> 33:10.080
if you wanna listen to it.

33:10.080 --> 33:12.400
I've listened to it three times.

So if you kill someone at a live show, you're covered.

34:29.440 --> 34:31.440
Oh, our live shows can be such a hoot nanny.

34:31.440 --> 34:33.040
Can we say the name of the person who it's from?

34:33.040 --> 34:35.200
Because I feel like we really buttfucked it.

34:35.200 --> 34:36.240
Stephanie Vigiano.

34:36.240 --> 34:39.040
Stephanie says, it's been a hilarious and wonderful four years

34:39.040 --> 34:42.080
to the guy who has the utmost appreciation of the absurd.

34:42.080 --> 34:45.760
Speaking of, Dan inserts his full name into any song

34:45.760 --> 34:46.720
as he sings it.

34:46.720 --> 34:48.720
Seriously, guys, try it.

34:48.720 --> 34:51.760
Rocket Man by Elton John particularly works.

34:51.760 --> 34:55.280
Do you mean like, Danny Klein?

34:55.280 --> 34:58.080
And is one of the best and most caring people I know.

34:58.080 --> 34:59.600
Happy anniversary, Danny.

34:59.600 --> 35:00.560
Here's to many more.

35:02.320 --> 35:04.320
I miss my dog so much.

35:04.880 --> 35:06.000
I'm Danny Klein.

35:08.080 --> 35:08.880
It does work.

35:10.720 --> 35:11.600
It's a pretty good name.

35:11.600 --> 35:15.200
I got a message for Lydia Lee, which is a really fun name to say.

35:15.200 --> 35:18.560
It's from your brother, your sister-in-law, and your sister.

35:18.560 --> 35:20.480

He shall be a good man.

35:24.240 --> 35:25.040
Here's the message.

35:25.040 --> 35:27.120

35:27.120 --> 35:28.320
Any Elton John song.

35:28.960 --> 35:30.560
Goodbye, Danny Klein.

35:31.200 --> 35:33.520
Hold me closer, Danny Klein.

35:38.000 --> 35:39.280
Got a message for Lydia Lee.

35:39.280 --> 35:40.720
Yeah, we're in it.

35:40.720 --> 35:42.880
We're deep, deep in the Lydia Lee event.

35:42.880 --> 35:44.480
Welcome to your message, Lydia Lee.

35:44.480 --> 35:45.360
Welcome, Lydia Lee.

35:45.360 --> 35:47.760
Hey, Lydia, have you heard of this Danny Klein fella?

35:47.760 --> 35:50.400
A lot of buzz about this Danny Klein guy.

35:50.400 --> 35:52.400
It's the Danny of Klein.

35:54.400 --> 35:56.000
Lydia Lee, here's a message for you.

35:56.000 --> 35:58.560
It's from your brother, your sister-in-law, and your sister.

35:59.840 --> 36:01.840
They say, happy birthday, Lydia Lee.

36:01.840 --> 36:05.440
We got you this message instead of Mueller Thurgauss,

36:06.400 --> 36:07.840
because we don't know what those are.

36:07.840 --> 36:10.320
Clearly, neither the fuck do I.

36:11.040 --> 36:12.160
Grapes, maybe?

36:12.160 --> 36:12.880
Whatever.

36:12.880 --> 36:13.920
Enjoy your day.

36:13.920 --> 36:17.120
Here's to many more years of one-stepping and asymmetrical

36:17.120 --> 36:17.920
haircuts.

36:17.920 --> 36:19.120
You're the best.

36:19.120 --> 36:20.560
Do kind of sound like the best.

36:21.600 --> 36:26.160
I very much enjoyed that Lydia said specifically what she

36:26.160 --> 36:28.880
wanted, and these people said, I'm not going to Google that.

36:28.880 --> 36:30.480
How about an ad on a podcast?

36:31.440 --> 36:32.320
Hope she listens.

36:32.880 --> 36:34.000
Hope she listens to it.

36:34.720 --> 36:38.720
Boy, I just Googled it, and it's a German, and so I can't tell.

36:38.720 --> 36:41.360
But there's a picture of grapes, so I'm going to say grapes.

36:41.360 --> 36:42.240
Yeah, good job.

36:42.240 --> 36:42.720
Yeah.

36:42.720 --> 36:44.160
You got it in one.

36:44.160 --> 36:45.760
We have one more ad this week.

36:45.760 --> 36:47.840
It's for my friend Bernie's show.

36:47.840 --> 36:49.120
It's called The Kill Corporation.

36:49.120 --> 36:52.080
You can go to www.thekillcorporation.com.

36:52.080 --> 36:52.960
It's super cool.

36:54.160 --> 36:55.360
So do you have a grievance?

36:55.360 --> 36:56.640
Want that corner office?

36:56.640 --> 36:58.880
Wish your neighbor would stop putting garbage in your can?

36:58.880 --> 37:00.480
Contact The Kill Corporation today.

37:01.040 --> 37:03.120
Basically, what it is is the concept of the show is in a

37:03.120 --> 37:06.480
world where you can submit your grievance, then they

37:06.480 --> 37:08.880
arbitrate, and the loser is killed.

37:09.440 --> 37:10.160
Jesus Christ.

37:10.160 --> 37:12.320
So that way, you don't have to ever deal with them again.

37:12.320 --> 37:13.440
You win, and it's done.

37:14.480 --> 37:19.040
On their web page, www.thekillcorporation, they have a bunch of people

37:19.040 --> 37:21.440
submitted testimonials and that kind of thing.

37:21.440 --> 37:23.600
And I submitted one, and it's on there.

37:23.600 --> 37:25.680
And it's about me doing a podcast.

37:25.680 --> 37:27.360
And go check it out.

37:27.360 --> 37:28.320
Did you win?

37:28.320 --> 37:29.840
Clearly, you won, or else you wouldn't be sitting here.

37:29.840 --> 37:30.720
I mean, I did win.

37:30.720 --> 37:32.240
So there's a spoiler.

37:32.240 --> 37:34.320
But go listen to it or watch it.

37:34.320 --> 37:35.200
It's very, very funny.

37:35.760 --> 37:36.880
And then watch the show.

37:36.880 --> 37:38.480
Watch all eight episodes.

37:38.480 --> 37:40.480
It really is a super cool concept.

37:40.480 --> 37:42.320
And they just need views.

37:42.320 --> 37:44.560
You don't have to spend money or anything like that.

37:44.560 --> 37:45.360
Just go watch it.

37:45.360 --> 37:47.120
It's like the easiest thing in the world.

37:47.120 --> 37:48.640
It's a really good name, too.

37:48.640 --> 37:49.440
Yeah, right?

37:49.440 --> 37:50.800
The Kill Corporation.

37:50.800 --> 37:51.280
That's cool.

37:52.160 --> 37:53.040
The website's neat, too.

37:53.040 --> 37:57.760
I watched some of the first episode before we started here, and it is cool.

37:57.760 --> 37:58.720
I'm going to go watch more.

37:59.760 --> 38:00.800
So go check it out.

38:00.800 --> 38:04.800
Happy birthday, nature box, and prosper.

38:04.800 --> 38:05.440

38:05.440 --> 38:06.240
Everything.

38:06.240 --> 38:07.360
Rocket Man.

38:07.360 --> 38:10.800
Do you want to do one more before we get back to regular questions?

38:10.800 --> 38:12.400
Goodbye, Danny Klein.

38:12.400 --> 38:12.880
I'll do that one.

38:13.440 --> 38:14.240
Did you do that one?

38:14.240 --> 38:14.480
OK.

38:16.240 --> 38:17.440
I sat on the roof.

38:18.240 --> 38:19.920
I kicked off Danny Klein.

38:21.520 --> 38:22.720
He's dead now.

38:22.720 --> 38:26.080
Play us a song, you're the Danny Klein.

38:26.080 --> 38:28.320
OK, well, that's William Joel.

38:28.320 --> 38:29.600
That's Dr. William Joel.

38:29.600 --> 38:32.720
Can't make a living as a Danny Klein anymore.

38:32.720 --> 38:42.640
Don't let the Danny Klein go down on me.

38:47.600 --> 38:52.080
Can you feel the Danny Klein?

38:52.080 --> 38:53.120
It's really good.

38:54.080 --> 38:57.680
I'm Danny Klein better than I ever did.

38:57.680 --> 39:03.200
Don't go, Danny.

39:03.200 --> 39:04.240
Danny Klein's all right.

39:04.240 --> 39:05.680
Fight him.

39:05.680 --> 39:06.400
OK, that's pretty good.

39:06.400 --> 39:07.200
OK, we're pretty good.

39:07.200 --> 39:07.520
We're done.

39:07.520 --> 39:08.000
Now we're done.

39:08.000 --> 39:08.640
Let's focus on it.

39:08.640 --> 39:10.000
Let's get serious about this comedy.

Join us every other Monday.

39:52.560 --> 39:59.280
I'm a college student, which means I attend a lot of events and meetings.

39:59.920 --> 40:06.240
Usually with those events, pizza is offered. My question is, is if there are three or four

40:06.240 --> 40:13.200
boxes of pizza there, how many slices are acceptable to eat? Should I just go with one

40:13.200 --> 40:18.080
or push the boundaries and eat three? That's from Munchen in Millageville.

40:18.080 --> 40:29.280
My jam, and I don't know what y'all's jams is, your respective jams, but is to eat until I can't

40:29.280 --> 40:32.960
anymore. And that goes for whatever.

40:34.560 --> 40:38.800
You know, I was actually, I was thinking about this and I guess my response is, how many do

40:38.800 --> 40:44.880
you want? Start there and then think about how many do you need and how many people there are.

40:44.880 --> 40:50.640
Because if there's like four boxes of people and four boxes of people, oh shit, get them out of

40:50.640 --> 40:56.160
there. If there's four boxes of pizza and a hundred people, maybe just take one.

40:57.520 --> 41:02.080
I have never been to a meeting where pizza was offered. What the fuck? I've never had a pizza

41:02.080 --> 41:07.440
meeting. You've never like done in college, like you get together a bunch of friends to study and

41:07.440 --> 41:11.920
order some pizza? That's not a meeting. That's a study group. He also says events.

41:11.920 --> 41:18.400
Okay, but not meetings. Guys, who's ever been like, listen, we really got to get these reports

41:18.400 --> 41:24.560
filed today and here's some za party. Nobody's leaving this room until we figure out a way to

41:24.560 --> 41:33.680
save this campaign. Who wants veggie? Pass that sweet daddy's ranch. Well, I, okay. So let's apply

41:33.680 --> 41:38.000
it to like donuts or like- No, why do you want to fucking, why you think we've already solved

41:38.000 --> 41:43.520
this conversation? We have to move on to donuts. Pizza is its own animal. Pizza ethics are a

41:43.520 --> 41:52.000
completely separate issue. I have a thing and you wouldn't suspect it because I'm overweight,

41:52.000 --> 41:56.800
but I have a thing that whenever there's like group food, like where people have to like line

41:56.800 --> 42:03.920
up to get group food- No, no, you're not. Oh, yeah, a little bit delayed. Okay, thanks. I have

42:03.920 --> 42:09.440
to hang back. Like I don't like to wait in line for food. I like to wait until everybody eats and

42:09.440 --> 42:15.840
then go up and swoop afterwards. I used to think it was because like, it's awkward being an overweight

42:15.840 --> 42:21.920
person lining up for food. Like I'm waiting for it. Like I just can't, I got to get in as soon as

42:21.920 --> 42:27.360
I can. But now I think it's so I can like kind of get whatever I want and not have to worry too much

42:27.360 --> 42:31.600
about it. Cause everybody else had their shot. But that's- You know, I used to just take extra.

42:31.600 --> 42:37.360
You know, I used to just take extra because I was so worried that someone else was going to take

42:37.360 --> 42:46.000
extra and not leave any like leftovers to go back to second. Oh, I'm that person. Oh, the whole time

42:46.000 --> 42:52.960
the killer was me. Yeah. I'm an unreliable narrator. Travis's Twilight Zone is a world of Travis's.

42:53.520 --> 42:57.520
That's his horrifying- I just assumed that everyone thought the same of me and said like,

42:57.520 --> 43:01.040
oh, this is free. I'm going to take as much as I want. So that way I can make sure someone else

43:01.040 --> 43:07.280
doesn't take it all. I'm actually coming to the realization. Oh my God, this is horrifying that

43:07.840 --> 43:15.600
at parties and weddings and formal and informal events anywhere on the formality spectrum events

43:16.880 --> 43:21.680
when the, when there's like a person who gets up and is like, okay guys, thanks for coming.

43:21.680 --> 43:28.480
Dinner is served. So everybody have at it. And then they gesture at somebody as if to say, like,

43:28.480 --> 43:33.520
you seem like the kind of person that's going to kick this thing off. It's almost, it's almost

43:33.520 --> 43:40.080
always me. This literally happened at my friend Clint's wedding where his dad was like,

43:40.080 --> 43:44.160
said led a short prayer and it was like, okay, everybody, thanks for coming to this great wedding.

43:44.160 --> 43:50.160
Let's get this party. And then he almost like winked at me, like started as if to say like,

43:50.160 --> 43:53.920
Griffin, you deserve the first play or maybe Griffin, why don't you break the ice here?

43:53.920 --> 43:58.880
Well, cause you're already standing in line. Am I like, do I just, I'm not,

43:58.880 --> 44:01.600
but do I just have the face of like an eager, hunky boy?

44:03.520 --> 44:07.600
You do have kind of a hunky boy face. I'm not like that. You just have an, in general,

44:07.600 --> 44:12.800
like comfortable being the good time guy face. That's probably it. I'm not like a super big boy,

44:12.800 --> 44:18.880
but I am. I guess I do like sort of give off a hunky vibe. Like I just,

44:18.880 --> 44:24.160
hunky for life, hunky for life. Yeah. I just want to eat, eat, eat life right off the cob,

44:24.960 --> 44:30.560
eat life right off the cob. Um, so you don't need anyone to cut your life off for you first

44:30.560 --> 44:34.560
and then eat it with a fork. I'm saying that I'm saying that this is a valuable position that I

44:34.560 --> 44:40.160
fill at a lot of parties, weddings and, and, um, brises and that like everybody feels uncomfortable.

44:40.160 --> 44:43.920
Everybody is adjusting. Nobody wants to be the first person at the table. Everybody's waiting

44:43.920 --> 44:47.680
for somebody to break the ice. And whenever that happens, do you ever really judge that person?

44:47.680 --> 44:54.000
No, of course not. Unless they are a Travis, not you. Do you know what I do judge people when,

44:54.000 --> 45:02.240
um, they are hovering when the announcement is made that food is now on offer. Like you look

45:02.240 --> 45:08.400
at the table and there's some hoverables just like chilling. That is solidly pre-Theresa Travis.

45:08.400 --> 45:13.440
Yeah. That is a no hand gently laid on the forearm by his loving wife, Travis.

45:13.440 --> 45:23.760
As if to say, let's be third in line as a full blown tiny tunes to as Travis. Yes. Travis thinks

45:23.760 --> 45:29.840
he was lucky to meet Theresa, but I assure you we are the lucky ones. The rest of us at the buffet.

45:29.840 --> 45:35.440
You guys want to Yahoo? Hit me. This Yahoo was sent in by level. Oh man. I actually wrote his

45:35.440 --> 45:40.400
name as Drew Davernport. That's a different guy. That's a different person, but now I have to go

45:40.400 --> 45:47.520
back and check. Did Drew Davernport send this in? Drew Davernport. Drew Davernport. And there's a

45:47.520 --> 45:51.680
couple oom louts in there. Thank you. Drew Davernport. It's by Yahoo answers user evening

45:51.680 --> 46:05.680
primrose who asks accidentally invented boyfriend. Danny and the clients. These girls at school kept

46:05.680 --> 46:13.840
teasing me about talking to a boy and we're like, pull, pull, pull. What? What were they saying?

46:13.840 --> 46:21.440
Pull or were they pulling at you? Well, I don't know. Ooh. And I got so asterisks off. I got so

46:21.440 --> 46:28.640
dicked off that I said, shut up. I already have a boyfriend. I'm not the datey type. So they started

46:28.640 --> 46:33.840
to ask all these questions. It was end of school. This happened as we were walking home. So I faked

46:33.840 --> 46:40.720
a text from my mom and left real quick, but I won't get away so easy tomorrow to shit. I won't

46:40.720 --> 46:48.960
get away so easy to Mo's at school. Help. No idea what to do. No idea what the question is. Is this

46:48.960 --> 46:56.880
cyber bullying? Did we just get cyber bullied? Wait. So the, they were teasing and pulling

46:56.880 --> 47:03.760
and then they were making taffy during a leisurely walk home from, from the academy.

47:03.760 --> 47:10.400
And she said, leave me alone. I've already got a boyfriend. Right. And they went, Oh,

47:10.400 --> 47:14.480
tell me anything about this boyfriend. And she went, did you guys hear that? It was my phone

47:14.480 --> 47:20.400
as my mom's. I gotta go. She left real quick. I'm going to bet, but they didn't buy it.

47:20.400 --> 47:25.840
Maybe it depends on how convincing that mom text was. If you, if you, if you reached in your pocket

47:25.840 --> 47:30.000
and said, whoops, and then you grabbed onto the back of a garbage truck passing by and just

47:30.000 --> 47:38.880
disappear and a puff of smoke. Has anyone ever done anything like that? And like the said to

47:38.880 --> 47:42.960
the bullies, like, no, it's cool. I've already got a boyfriend or girlfriend or you wouldn't know

47:42.960 --> 47:47.120
where or something like that. And they went, Oh, okay. Well, sorry. I'm sorry that we said anything

47:47.120 --> 47:52.320
that fucking college football player. It was kind of that situation. I would say it was the exact

47:52.320 --> 47:55.840
opposite of that situation, girlfriend. Cause he said, I've got a girlfriend. And then people

47:55.840 --> 48:02.400
said, I don't think you do means that I'll prove it. And she was made up. Man, Titeo.

48:02.400 --> 48:09.440
Whew. Oh, good call. Thanks Google. Um, what? Okay. Out of curiosity, what was that search string?

48:09.440 --> 48:16.640
Uh, I searched for Hawaiian football girlfriend knew from the producers of Jingle all the way too.

48:19.360 --> 48:25.440
Was he Hawaiian? Yeah, he was. Uh, God, thanks. Thanks again. Google really saving my

48:25.440 --> 48:32.960
bacon. Um, how do you gingerly crab walk out of this situation? Tell him he died the night

48:32.960 --> 48:36.960
after you told him about, oh, sorry. I'd love to, but he died. Can you stop talking about

48:36.960 --> 48:42.640
it? Sorry. I'd love to, but he died. Can you stop teasing me? I, he, he, he, I got a real fault in

48:42.640 --> 48:47.360
our stars situation on my hands. I told him they were teasing me and he felt so bad about it that

48:47.360 --> 48:52.240
he went out to get me some flowers. And while he was out, he interrupted a robbery and saved a

48:52.240 --> 48:56.800
little boy, but he was shot to death. He went, he felt so bad about it. He went out to get me

48:56.800 --> 49:02.240
some ice cream, but on his way back, the ice cream fell off the cone onto the floor and he leaned

49:02.240 --> 49:08.000
over to pick it up and he ran headlong into a car in the car. He in the car didn't make it.

49:08.000 --> 49:13.360
You got decapitated. Treasure every moment. Cause you never know. Cause you never know.

49:13.360 --> 49:19.120
Treasure each moment on this earth. Yolo. And then say, you can still feel his spirit near you

49:19.120 --> 49:23.040
and then, and then just pretend to be haunted by him for the rest of your school career. And

49:23.040 --> 49:28.720
you won't have to worry about having a boyfriend again. There you go. I can't, I can't risk being

49:28.720 --> 49:35.120
hurt like that again. Now that fucking guy who catfished Tao could have pulled, could have,

49:35.120 --> 49:40.400
could have saved him a lot of indecency, but I can't be your girlfriend anymore. I'm dead.

49:40.400 --> 49:47.040
I'm dead. I died. I'm sorry. I died 50 years ago this very night. There's never been a Hawaiian

49:47.040 --> 49:54.800
football girlfriend here. Not for 50 years. What's your Hawaiian girlfriend's name again?

49:54.800 --> 50:06.480
Large March. That was your first clue. Let's end this show. Yeah. I think that's the only thing

50:07.120 --> 50:10.320
