00:00.000 --> 00:04.820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

00:05.760 --> 00:10.580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

00:11.480 --> 00:17.660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

00:17.660 --> 00:30.660
What's up, you cool, baby?

00:47.660 --> 00:50.660
Ah, it's better, it's better with you

00:50.660 --> 00:51.660
My life

00:51.660 --> 00:56.660
Ah, it's better, it's better with you

00:56.660 --> 00:57.660
This is true

00:57.660 --> 01:02.660
Ah, it's better, it's better with you

01:02.660 --> 01:03.660
My life

01:03.660 --> 01:09.660
Ah, it's better with you

01:10.660 --> 01:14.660
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother, my brother, me and advice show for the modern era

01:14.660 --> 01:16.660
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy

01:16.660 --> 01:20.660
And I'm your middle-est brother Travis McElroy

01:20.660 --> 01:21.660
Wow

01:21.660 --> 01:22.660
Feels good

01:22.660 --> 01:24.660
It feels good, it feels real good

01:24.660 --> 01:27.660
And I'm old man 2021

01:27.660 --> 01:29.660
Oh, oh, oh no

01:29.660 --> 01:32.660
Wah wah baby, it's 2022 here

01:32.660 --> 01:35.660
Wait, did that baby just beat that old man to death?

01:35.660 --> 01:39.660
It did, it's 2022, this is Griffin, this is sweet baby brother Griffin McElroy 2022

01:39.660 --> 01:40.660
Is that what happens every year?

01:40.660 --> 01:43.660
This baby is naked and it doesn't have a name

01:43.660 --> 01:45.660
It's covered in blood it sounds like

01:45.660 --> 01:47.660
It's covered in old man blood

01:47.660 --> 01:50.660
When was the last time we recorded my brother, my brother and me?

01:50.660 --> 01:51.660
Quick quiz

01:51.660 --> 01:52.660
Before Krimi

01:52.660 --> 01:53.660
I think it's before Krimi

01:53.660 --> 01:54.660
It's before Krimi for sure

01:54.660 --> 01:56.660
It was the first week of December maybe?

01:56.660 --> 02:04.660
It's been weeks since we recorded, we're fired up, we're ready, we're excited to welcome 2022

02:04.660 --> 02:05.660
Yes

02:05.660 --> 02:10.660
Which we're not going to have to call it that much longer because we're about to pick our annual theme

02:10.660 --> 02:12.660
This is an episode that I look forward to

02:12.660 --> 02:17.660
If you haven't listened before, this is a great episode to get people started with

02:17.660 --> 02:18.660
Is it?

02:18.660 --> 02:19.660
Yeah for sure

02:19.660 --> 02:25.660
I love this podcast, these guys do a half hour of clumsy wordplay at the beginning of every episode

02:25.660 --> 02:29.660
Fight about nothing and then move on from there to talk about McDonalds

02:29.660 --> 02:30.660
Let's just start it off

02:30.660 --> 02:31.660
Yes

02:31.660 --> 02:32.660
20 didgeridoo

02:32.660 --> 02:34.660
20 didgeridoo is bad

02:34.660 --> 02:39.660
Let's start it off by, and this is also tradition, going through previous years

02:39.660 --> 02:40.660
Yes, yes, yes

02:40.660 --> 02:43.660
2010, 2010, Zolo, of course

02:43.660 --> 02:44.660
Ridingless, correct

02:44.660 --> 02:47.660
2011, 2000 in heaven, get right with Christ

02:47.660 --> 02:48.660
Okay

02:48.660 --> 02:49.660
Then we had 20 does

02:49.660 --> 02:50.660
Big swing

02:50.660 --> 02:52.660
20 does, getting it

02:52.660 --> 03:00.660
A simple, it's so rudimentary, I love how simple we started with it before our palette expanded

03:00.660 --> 03:03.660
20 dirt, dig it up, get it out, that is of course 2013

03:03.660 --> 03:04.660
That's good

03:04.660 --> 03:09.660
2014, 20 forward, sounds like a, I don't know

03:09.660 --> 03:14.660
We really played fast and loose with the idea, I think we've like

03:14.660 --> 03:15.660
We've grown up

03:15.660 --> 03:18.660
It really codified in 2015, okay?

03:18.660 --> 03:20.660
2015 was 20 grifty and the con is on

03:20.660 --> 03:23.660
That was the best, right? We're not going to top that

03:23.660 --> 03:30.660
You know what else I was reflecting on, a challenge, is that the years in the first decade we did this

03:30.660 --> 03:31.660
I'm so old

03:31.660 --> 03:34.660
The first decade we did this, the sounds are all the same

03:34.660 --> 03:35.660
Yeah

03:35.660 --> 03:41.660
I was returning to a lot of established themes this year, trying to find more rhymes for 20

03:41.660 --> 03:42.660
Yeah

03:42.660 --> 03:43.660
But okay

03:43.660 --> 03:47.660
Then we had 2016, building bridges, we look back on that one pretty shamefully

03:47.660 --> 03:48.660
Yeah

03:48.660 --> 03:49.660
Oh boy

03:49.660 --> 03:50.660
Maybe our biggest whiff

03:50.660 --> 03:53.660
That might be the biggest ironic one we've ever done

03:53.660 --> 03:56.660
If that could have been grift teen, that would have been really good

03:56.660 --> 03:57.660
Yeah, that literally could have fixed some shit

03:57.660 --> 04:00.660
20 serpentine, keep them guessing, zag on them

04:00.660 --> 04:01.660
Very good

04:01.660 --> 04:02.660
Very good

04:02.660 --> 04:04.660
Collaborate teen, stronger together

04:04.660 --> 04:11.660
I feel like we had a lot of so-so ones until we hit 2019, which was Frankenstein teen, become the monster

04:11.660 --> 04:12.660
Right

04:12.660 --> 04:17.660
That one might be the most potent, I think that we had done

04:17.660 --> 04:18.660
That was a powerful one

04:18.660 --> 04:19.660
That was a good one

04:19.660 --> 04:24.660
Then we had 20 funny, fill your life with laughter and love, which then became 20 honey down to bee'sness

04:24.660 --> 04:26.660
That's right, that's right

04:26.660 --> 04:27.660
I'm so bad

04:27.660 --> 04:30.660
That's one of the few slash years that we had

04:30.660 --> 04:34.660
Yeah, and then we had, of course last year, 20 big dog run, no boats about it

04:34.660 --> 04:37.660
Fuck, that was a good naming, last year's naming episode was a good one

04:37.660 --> 04:43.660
I don't know that we're going to top it this time, but that is what we've done so far

04:43.660 --> 04:46.660
How many names do you guys have in front of you that you cooked up?

04:46.660 --> 04:47.660
None

04:47.660 --> 04:48.660
I'm coming in hot

04:48.660 --> 04:50.660
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight

04:50.660 --> 04:51.660
Oh my god, that's too many

04:51.660 --> 04:52.660
I have five

04:52.660 --> 04:53.660
Wow, that's a lot, okay

04:53.660 --> 04:54.660
Okay

04:54.660 --> 05:00.660
Because also, I'm just going to, I'm 38 now, when we started naming years, of course I was 25, now I'm 38

05:00.660 --> 05:03.660
A lot of these are bad, I'm just going to, right off the top of my head

05:03.660 --> 05:04.660
Okay, a lot of these are bad

05:04.660 --> 05:07.660
A lot of these are just thought generators

05:07.660 --> 05:08.660
Yeah

05:08.660 --> 05:09.660
Thought starters, yeah

05:09.660 --> 05:19.660
So, I want to throw out kind of a big conceptual one that I don't think will necessarily merit further consideration

05:19.660 --> 05:21.660
But I was excited about it

05:21.660 --> 05:24.660
Two, two, two, two, deuces are wild

05:24.660 --> 05:30.660
And what this is, it reimagines a future where we've been hurtled 200 years into the future

05:30.660 --> 05:31.660
Okay

05:31.660 --> 05:32.660
Right

05:32.660 --> 05:33.660
Okay

05:33.660 --> 05:35.660
Two, two, two, because we're not going to make it there, Ovs

05:35.660 --> 05:36.660
Two, two, two, two

05:36.660 --> 05:37.660
Now, hold on, do you mean just us or the planet?

05:37.660 --> 05:38.660
Just us, just us

05:38.660 --> 05:39.660
The planet will make it

05:39.660 --> 05:40.660
The planet will make it

05:40.660 --> 05:41.660
We'll figure it out, we're humans

05:41.660 --> 05:42.660
I might make it, Justin, you don't know

05:42.660 --> 05:44.660
Two, two, two, two, deuces are wild

05:44.660 --> 05:47.660
I think if it's just deuces wild, I think deuces wild

05:47.660 --> 05:48.660
Deuces wild, yeah

05:48.660 --> 05:56.660
I like deuces wild because the year that we are currently in, not 200 years into the future, does have a considerable number of twos in it

05:56.660 --> 05:57.660
Right

05:57.660 --> 05:58.660
But not all the twos

05:58.660 --> 05:59.660
I just want you to get that one more two

05:59.660 --> 06:01.660
Yeah, not all the twos it could have, to Justin's point

06:01.660 --> 06:05.660
I mean, I understand that time travel would be a big conceptual thing

06:05.660 --> 06:07.660
I'm embarrassed at this one and I don't want to talk about it anymore

06:07.660 --> 06:08.660
It sucks

06:08.660 --> 06:11.660
Travis, let me sort of traffic cop this a little bit until we sort of get our rhythm

06:11.660 --> 06:18.660
Travis, do three in a row of your worst ones real quick, just so the audience doesn't have that sort of Damocles hanging over their ears

06:18.660 --> 06:19.660
Okay, okay

06:19.660 --> 06:22.660
Twenty hoo-hoo, let's learn about owls

06:22.660 --> 06:24.660
Not even, like not even in the ball game

06:24.660 --> 06:25.660
Just go, just go

06:25.660 --> 06:28.660
Twenty hooty-hoo, let's learn about outcast

06:28.660 --> 06:31.660
As a parry, they're good

06:31.660 --> 06:34.660
As a parry, they're good

06:34.660 --> 06:37.660
Next, I'm not even going to put these on the Google Doc, but keep on rocking and rolling

06:37.660 --> 06:40.660
Third, twenty boppity-boo, be the magic

06:40.660 --> 06:45.660
So you're not even, you have eschewed twenty as a rhyming

06:45.660 --> 06:48.660
I told you they're not good

06:48.660 --> 06:53.660
But I could say like Carl Daniels

06:53.660 --> 06:56.660
No, they all rhyme with twenty-two

06:56.660 --> 07:03.660
Hold on, wait, Justin's just introduced a really powerful concept that I wanted to stop and make sure we take a beat, okay?

07:03.660 --> 07:20.660
And that is that, have we been hamstringing ourselves by needing to rhyme and also not giving the year a real human name like Carl Daniels

07:20.660 --> 07:24.660
It wouldn't be powerful to be like, fucking Carl Daniels, Carl Daniels sucked

07:24.660 --> 07:29.660
Or, if we're being optimistic, man, Carl Daniels was the best, wasn't he?

07:29.660 --> 07:32.660
Carl turned it the fuck around for this nation of ours

07:32.660 --> 07:37.660
If I could say, I think, oh my god, to send jokes out of the room

07:37.660 --> 07:48.660
I think we do need to limit ourselves to the rhyme, because it's one of the few things, if we open the palette up that much, we'll never crack this

07:48.660 --> 07:51.660
I think the restrictions make it important

07:51.660 --> 07:57.660
There's so few things that people can rely on anymore, I think they need to rely on a rhyming year theme

07:57.660 --> 07:59.660
That would be my argument

07:59.660 --> 08:07.660
Instead of it being, just one last thing though, instead of it naming the year Carl Daniels, can we make it possessive and just make it Carl Daniels' kickass year

08:07.660 --> 08:15.660
And then all the Carl Daniels' out there, just know that they're gonna find a 20 on the street every day

08:15.660 --> 08:21.660
Well, what if we make it a rhyming year, but the tagline is, a good year for Carl's

08:21.660 --> 08:23.660
A great year for a great Carl

08:23.660 --> 08:28.660
It was a good year for Carl's, and make it retrospective right out the gate

08:28.660 --> 08:35.660
I'm gonna go ahead and keep suggesting this, and it will be relevant every year this decade, to just do 20 cummies to

08:35.660 --> 08:40.660
I hate it

08:40.660 --> 08:46.660
And I still haven't learned really what that word means, aside from context clues that it does involve

08:46.660 --> 08:49.660
Do we let Travis do one more bad one, just to get a story

08:49.660 --> 08:52.660
Travis, why don't you get, are all eight of yours bad?

08:52.660 --> 09:00.660
There's one that I really like, and it would be kind of a different direction for our year of protection

09:00.660 --> 09:02.660
Alright, let's have a beefy one, let's have one that we can really sup on

09:02.660 --> 09:05.660
20 whoopty-doo, who cares

09:05.660 --> 09:06.660
No

09:06.660 --> 09:07.660
No no no no, Justin

09:07.660 --> 09:09.660
No, I don't like the nihilism of that

09:09.660 --> 09:13.660
No no no no, but let's fucking cross-examine it, don't just shit on it

09:13.660 --> 09:15.660
You're right, okay, you're right

09:15.660 --> 09:17.660
20 whoopty-doo, who gives a shit

09:17.660 --> 09:19.660
Oh, I like that better, yeah, who gives a shit

09:19.660 --> 09:28.660
We've given the years in the past powerful, powerful dragon shouts, I would say, of mottos and names

09:28.660 --> 09:31.660
And what fucking good has it done so far, right?

09:31.660 --> 09:32.660
Correct

09:32.660 --> 09:38.660
Like we, certainly we look to Big Dog Run, and we think like, I could be stronger

09:38.660 --> 09:46.660
But at the end of the day, you know, Omicron wasn't like, whoa, look at all these big dogs, let's get out of here

09:46.660 --> 09:54.660
If we, if we like, don't necessarily look at the year, we don't quantum lock it

09:54.660 --> 09:59.660
Is it possible that we could have, like the end would justify the means a little bit

09:59.660 --> 10:03.660
It's interesting that 20 Big Dog Run was our most stationary year

10:03.660 --> 10:07.660
Both physically and, I would argue, professionally

10:07.660 --> 10:08.660
Just a real

10:08.660 --> 10:10.660
Emotionally, psychically

10:10.660 --> 10:14.660
Yeah, just keeping it between the navigational beacons, you know? Just trying to stay on course

10:14.660 --> 10:17.660
What I also like about it is you could treat it like a genuine question

10:17.660 --> 10:19.660
20 whoop-de-doo, who cares?

10:19.660 --> 10:21.660
I do, I do

10:21.660 --> 10:22.660
I care

10:22.660 --> 10:23.660
I care

10:23.660 --> 10:24.660
I'll answer that call

10:24.660 --> 10:28.660
Okay, I want to, I want to put it on the, well, you know

10:28.660 --> 10:32.660
It's on there, it's on there, Travis, you're not in this Google Doc, so I don't know what the fuck you're doing right now

10:32.660 --> 10:33.660
That's more important than this

10:33.660 --> 10:35.660
I'm listening and paying attention

10:35.660 --> 10:38.660
Yeah, so where is the Google Doc?

10:38.660 --> 10:40.660
I shared it with you, to your email

10:40.660 --> 10:41.660
Where?

10:41.660 --> 10:43.660
To share with your email

10:43.660 --> 10:45.660
Okay, I'm in it

10:45.660 --> 10:50.660
Okay, I'm going to throw out one of my, one of my better options

10:50.660 --> 10:51.660
Alright, let's have it, let's have it

10:51.660 --> 10:52.660
Okay

10:52.660 --> 10:55.660
20 Yummy Stew, something's cooking

10:55.660 --> 10:58.660
20 Yummy Stew, something's cooking

10:58.660 --> 11:02.660
What I like, my argument for this is one, it's fun to say

11:02.660 --> 11:04.660
20 Yummy Stew, something's cooking

11:04.660 --> 11:08.660
I like there's an exclamation, I put an exclamation point in the notes just because like phonetically

11:08.660 --> 11:10.660
Like it felt like you were kind of excited

11:10.660 --> 11:13.660
But I do like having a punctuation mark in it

11:13.660 --> 11:20.660
No, no, no, see the thing is you can delete the punctuation and then it removes pressure

11:20.660 --> 11:25.660
What I like about this is like we can get to the end of the year and like nothing has happened

11:25.660 --> 11:29.660
But it's like, I don't know, it feels like something's cooking

11:29.660 --> 11:31.660
Something's cooking

11:31.660 --> 11:36.660
Yeah, it's definitely, it's definitely I in apostrophe, I won't accept that G

11:36.660 --> 11:37.660
Something's cooking

11:37.660 --> 11:42.660
Something's cooking, now can you make it a question and make it 20 Yummy Stew, what's cooking?

11:42.660 --> 11:44.660
What's cooking?

11:44.660 --> 11:48.660
So then it's a little more interactive, a little more actionable, that's my worry

11:48.660 --> 11:57.660
That's bad because if, you know, due to climate change, if wildfires continue to be the sort of clear and present threat they were in previous years

11:57.660 --> 11:58.660
I think that that

11:58.660 --> 11:59.660
That would be in poor taste

11:59.660 --> 12:04.660
So then I guess you're also against 20 Yummy Stew, what's cooking good looking? Is that too much?

12:04.660 --> 12:06.660
Yeah, I don't want to harass people with the name of the year

12:06.660 --> 12:14.660
I feel like the only problem with this Justin is that in the last, let's say six years

12:14.660 --> 12:22.660
I have, there has not been an event that has been sort of a slow building moment

12:22.660 --> 12:26.660
That has been a good thing that we're all wicked looking forward to

12:26.660 --> 12:27.660
Do you know what I mean?

12:27.660 --> 12:36.660
It's not like, oh man, there's a sinkhole that's very, very slowly opening up somewhere in South America

12:36.660 --> 12:39.660
And it's very slowly consuming this community

12:39.660 --> 12:41.660
But what's that coming out of it?

12:41.660 --> 12:43.660
It's taste stations and they're back

12:43.660 --> 12:45.660
Like there hasn't been a thing that's like

12:45.660 --> 12:48.660
I'm pretty sure taste stations are back

12:48.660 --> 12:49.660
Something's cooking

12:49.660 --> 12:50.660
Now can we go in a different direction where stew

12:50.660 --> 12:51.660
Cream savers are back

12:51.660 --> 12:52.660
Cream savers

12:52.660 --> 12:53.660
Thank you, thank you, thank you

12:53.660 --> 13:00.660
Where stew is a sort of mixed up bag of ingredients

13:00.660 --> 13:07.660
Is there something like 20 Yummy Stew, toss an onion in

13:07.660 --> 13:09.660
Toss your stuff in

13:09.660 --> 13:11.660
I don't think we need

13:11.660 --> 13:13.660
I like people to sort of read their own context into it

13:13.660 --> 13:18.660
Beyond the sort of like basic setting of expectations

13:18.660 --> 13:20.660
I feel like that's where we're at

13:20.660 --> 13:23.660
What do you do if something's cooking?

13:23.660 --> 13:26.660
Well it's just like something's cooking, you know?

13:26.660 --> 13:29.660
Travis is saying there needs to be an act

13:29.660 --> 13:30.660
This is an observation

13:30.660 --> 13:31.660
We need a like

13:31.660 --> 13:33.660
Let me tell you a tagline

13:33.660 --> 13:34.660
Mix it up

13:34.660 --> 13:35.660
What about 20 Yummy Stew, mix it up

13:35.660 --> 13:38.660
Well I've got a tagline that I'm pretty excited about

13:38.660 --> 13:40.660
20 Yummy Stew, put it in the pot

13:40.660 --> 13:41.660
Huh

13:41.660 --> 13:43.660
Okay, what would that be?

13:43.660 --> 13:46.660
What you have, what you've got, put it in the pot

13:46.660 --> 13:49.660
20 Yummy Stew, let it simmer

13:49.660 --> 13:51.660
Let it simmer is again like I don't

13:51.660 --> 13:54.660
That's a very passive thing

13:54.660 --> 13:55.660
Put it in the pot

13:55.660 --> 13:56.660
Take what you've got

13:56.660 --> 13:57.660
But what does that mean?

13:57.660 --> 13:58.660
I'm trying to

13:58.660 --> 13:59.660
We're talking about it

13:59.660 --> 14:04.660
Instead of asking, just turn that beautiful thinking brain on

14:04.660 --> 14:05.660
Put it in the pot

14:05.660 --> 14:06.660
What do you have?

14:06.660 --> 14:07.660
You have something special

14:07.660 --> 14:08.660
I have something special

14:08.660 --> 14:09.660
Put it in the pot

14:09.660 --> 14:11.660
Oh, it's a stone soup scenario

14:11.660 --> 14:13.660
It's a stone soup situation

14:13.660 --> 14:14.660
Okay, stone soup

14:14.660 --> 14:15.660
Now I get it

14:15.660 --> 14:17.660
So we're all adding something

14:17.660 --> 14:18.660
Put it in the pot

14:18.660 --> 14:19.660
I just like how that sounds

14:19.660 --> 14:20.660
Put it in the pot

14:20.660 --> 14:21.660
Put it in the pot

14:21.660 --> 14:22.660
That's not bad

14:22.660 --> 14:25.660
Don't be embarrassed about that thing that you have

14:25.660 --> 14:26.660
Just put it in the pot

14:26.660 --> 14:28.660
That idea, put it in the pot, let's see what happens

14:28.660 --> 14:30.660
Maybe it'll be good, maybe it won't

14:30.660 --> 14:31.660
20 Yummy Stew

14:31.660 --> 14:35.660
Okay, Trav, do you have another one that you'd like to offer?

14:35.660 --> 14:36.660
Griffin, does anything

14:36.660 --> 14:38.660
I got something that's been coming through my head

14:38.660 --> 14:40.660
because I was thinking about this

14:40.660 --> 14:41.660
Is it about cummies again?

14:41.660 --> 14:43.660
It's not about cummies this time

14:43.660 --> 14:45.660
But I will, sorry, I will add 20 cummies

14:45.660 --> 14:47.660
No, I hate it

14:47.660 --> 14:49.660
I hate it so much

14:49.660 --> 14:52.660
And it's a different one

14:52.660 --> 14:55.660
So just hang on, you ready?

14:55.660 --> 15:03.660
20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20

15:03.660 --> 15:04.660
Try that out

15:04.660 --> 15:05.660
Try that out for size

15:05.660 --> 15:06.660
Wait, that's it?

15:06.660 --> 15:07.660
I thought that was a build up

15:07.660 --> 15:09.660
No, the name of the year is

15:09.660 --> 15:13.660
20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20

15:13.660 --> 15:16.660
What is that for?

15:16.660 --> 15:17.660
Try it out

15:17.660 --> 15:18.660
You should have written some down

15:18.660 --> 15:19.660
Why are you trying to break

15:19.660 --> 15:22.660
We have so few rules and conventions, Griffin

15:22.660 --> 15:24.660
You should have written some down, Griffin

15:24.660 --> 15:27.660
But you should try saying it out loud because it feels good

15:27.660 --> 15:30.660
20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20

15:30.660 --> 15:31.660
It does get me pumped

15:31.660 --> 15:32.660
It does

15:32.660 --> 15:34.660
Yeah, but I have had to institute a

15:34.660 --> 15:37.660
we don't chant for things rule in my house

15:37.660 --> 15:38.660
Okay

15:38.660 --> 15:39.660
So it does

15:39.660 --> 15:41.660
I can see it would be a little bit hypocritical

15:41.660 --> 15:42.660
It would be a little bit hypocritical

15:42.660 --> 15:48.660
because of how often my two children instigate each other into pounding the table to ask for candy or whatever

15:48.660 --> 15:53.660
And this feels a little bit insightful, like inciting

15:53.660 --> 15:56.660
Okay, all right, it's on the list

15:56.660 --> 16:00.660
How about 20 funny shoes

16:00.660 --> 16:01.660
20 funny shoes

16:01.660 --> 16:03.660
They don't got to match all the time

16:03.660 --> 16:06.660
Right?

16:06.660 --> 16:08.660
I'm trying to think of something with shoes

16:08.660 --> 16:10.660
20 funny shoes and odd pairing

16:10.660 --> 16:12.660
Ooh

16:12.660 --> 16:14.660
Ooh, something different

16:14.660 --> 16:16.660
Ooh, an interesting pairing

16:16.660 --> 16:19.660
That would be cool if in past years we've been like, believe in yourself

16:19.660 --> 16:20.660
Or work with others

16:20.660 --> 16:22.660
Or build those bridges

16:22.660 --> 16:25.660
And then this year we're like, wear different shoes

16:25.660 --> 16:27.660
You can do this

16:27.660 --> 16:28.660
This you can do

16:28.660 --> 16:29.660
Shoes not match

16:29.660 --> 16:33.660
And then that would be great because then you would see somebody on the street with not matching shoes

16:33.660 --> 16:36.660
You'd be like, that asshole listens to my brother and my brother and me

16:36.660 --> 16:39.660
Yeah, that's like an international sign of

16:39.660 --> 16:41.660
Just wish we could monetize it

16:41.660 --> 16:42.660
That's the problem, we don't sell shoes

16:42.660 --> 16:43.660
Not yet

16:43.660 --> 16:44.660
Not yet

16:44.660 --> 16:46.660
Okay, listen to this

16:46.660 --> 16:48.660
All right

16:48.660 --> 16:51.660
20 Venti Brew, oh that Java

16:51.660 --> 16:52.660
Oh

16:52.660 --> 16:54.660
20 Venti Brew, oh that Java

16:54.660 --> 17:00.660
When you say it, you have this way of saying them afterwards that really sucks the fucking air out of it

17:00.660 --> 17:04.660
Give it a little bit of panache

17:04.660 --> 17:08.660
Let me try it again and you listen and imagine I came up with it and not you, okay?

17:08.660 --> 17:11.660
20 Venti Brew, oh that Java

17:11.660 --> 17:13.660
It was fun to say like that wasn't it

17:13.660 --> 17:14.660
Yeah, that's pretty good

17:14.660 --> 17:15.660
It was kind of fun to say

17:15.660 --> 17:18.660
This is what I like

17:18.660 --> 17:22.660
Maybe this year I could just get bigger coffees

17:22.660 --> 17:24.660
Maybe that's what we've been missing

17:24.660 --> 17:25.660
That's pretty good

17:25.660 --> 17:26.660
What about

17:26.660 --> 17:29.660
I don't like how Starbucks has kind of co-opted the Venti thing

17:29.660 --> 17:31.660
I hate doing that

17:31.660 --> 17:32.660
Wait, from you?

17:32.660 --> 17:34.660
When you guys go to Starbucks

17:34.660 --> 17:35.660
I say large

17:35.660 --> 17:36.660
Large, right?

17:36.660 --> 17:37.660
Yeah

17:37.660 --> 17:38.660
A large, thank you

17:38.660 --> 17:40.660
Yeah, like a human

17:40.660 --> 17:42.660
What about

17:42.660 --> 17:45.660
We just kind of brew blue right past it

17:45.660 --> 17:47.660
I feel like it's on there and we'll circle back to it Justin

17:47.660 --> 17:49.660
I don't want to spend too much time on it ruining it

17:49.660 --> 17:51.660
I like brew

17:51.660 --> 17:55.660
Brew as a verb I could get into

17:55.660 --> 17:58.660
I don't know about Venti and having it be like a witch's brew

17:58.660 --> 18:02.660
I guess we are getting back to something's cooking or put it in a pot

18:02.660 --> 18:03.660
Yeah, that's true

18:03.660 --> 18:06.660
What about 20 skies of blue, anything's possible

18:06.660 --> 18:09.660
Whoa, I like that actually

18:09.660 --> 18:11.660
Skies of though

18:11.660 --> 18:16.660
Skies of blue is interesting because one

18:16.660 --> 18:19.660
Wow, what an incredible

18:19.660 --> 18:24.660
You are opening up the possibility space for us to fail even more powerfully

18:24.660 --> 18:25.660
Yeah, yeah

18:25.660 --> 18:26.660
Than we did in 2016

18:26.660 --> 18:29.660
I have two options and it's either whoopty-doo, who cares

18:29.660 --> 18:31.660
Or skies of blue, anything's possible

18:31.660 --> 18:34.660
I only have two settings Justin

18:34.660 --> 18:41.660
I see that you didn't add 20 skies of blue, anything's possible to the list

18:41.660 --> 18:43.660
He'll add it, he'll add it, it's a good one

18:43.660 --> 18:46.660
One, I don't know why I'm adding all of the things

18:46.660 --> 18:50.660
Because you didn't come up with any numbers because you didn't come up with any names beforehand

18:50.660 --> 18:55.660
So this is your contribution, your secretary, your stenographer

18:55.660 --> 18:58.660
There you go, you're keeping the minutes

18:58.660 --> 18:59.660
Let me hit you with this

18:59.660 --> 19:04.660
I don't have a tagline for it but it seems like it's right for any tagline we could want to put on it

19:04.660 --> 19:08.660
20 coming through, clear the way

19:08.660 --> 19:13.660
20 coming through, emerge into your power

19:13.660 --> 19:14.660
Emerge

19:14.660 --> 19:16.660
Part 20 coming through, emerge

19:16.660 --> 19:18.660
Oh shit, that's good

19:18.660 --> 19:20.660
That's pretty good, I like that

19:20.660 --> 19:24.660
Imagine that on like a big projector

19:24.660 --> 19:29.660
A big, what are those things called that you put on the lights to make it appear?

19:29.660 --> 19:30.660
A gobo

19:30.660 --> 19:33.660
A gobo, a big gobo that just says emerge

19:33.660 --> 19:34.660
Emerge

19:34.660 --> 19:35.660
20 coming through

19:35.660 --> 19:36.660
That's powerful as shit

19:36.660 --> 19:39.660
20 coming through, emerge, I really like it

19:39.660 --> 19:40.660
That's really doing me right

19:40.660 --> 19:46.660
This is the episode, by the way, most of the episodes we record in a given year

19:46.660 --> 19:53.660
The one where my let's not accidentally make a cult radar is up

19:53.660 --> 19:55.660
Oh, you don't want to

19:55.660 --> 20:01.660
I did just imagine a crowd full of people, this is by the way after we whipped this COVID shit

20:01.660 --> 20:04.660
Just in an auditorium and the three of us

20:04.660 --> 20:08.660
For some reason we're dressed in all white and our shoes don't match

20:08.660 --> 20:11.660
And there's a big sign behind us that says emerge

20:11.660 --> 20:16.660
As people chant against my rules, everybody's chanting emerge

20:16.660 --> 20:19.660
Everybody's going 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20

20:19.660 --> 20:26.660
To the outside observer, we have made a cult for sure at that point

20:26.660 --> 20:28.660
For sure, for sure, for sure

20:28.660 --> 20:34.660
I also want to take a moment to celebrate us because in making this procedure public

20:34.660 --> 20:38.660
We open ourselves up to, I mean literally every year

20:38.660 --> 20:45.660
Multiple people telling us they wish we had done one of the other things that we talked about

20:45.660 --> 20:50.660
And sometimes even suggesting other things we didn't say

20:50.660 --> 20:56.660
This is interesting, in previous years we have opened it up to suggestions

20:56.660 --> 20:58.660
And this is just us this time

20:58.660 --> 21:00.660
I did not consult the crowd

21:00.660 --> 21:02.660
Oh, you didn't need to

21:02.660 --> 21:05.660
Plenty of people emailed them in and tweeted them

21:05.660 --> 21:10.660
I would say also in our defense we have never gone with the audience suggestion for this

21:10.660 --> 21:14.660
Because that's a little too important a decision I would say

21:14.660 --> 21:16.660
It could be trademark

21:16.660 --> 21:18.660
Yeah, that's a big thing too

21:18.660 --> 21:21.660
Otherwise you're not going to get classics like this

21:21.660 --> 21:23.660
Yeah, like 20 runny goo

21:23.660 --> 21:26.660
No, no, I was leaning into a real great slide

21:26.660 --> 21:28.660
You're not going to get classics like this

21:28.660 --> 21:30.660
20 sun tee view

21:30.660 --> 21:32.660
Porch life

21:32.660 --> 21:36.660
20 sun tee view

21:36.660 --> 21:39.660
You're holding the sun tee, right?

21:39.660 --> 21:41.660
And this is your view from the porch

21:41.660 --> 21:44.660
And you've got a sun tee view, porch life

21:44.660 --> 21:48.660
Now I think the one problem with that, Justin, is I don't know

21:48.660 --> 21:54.660
I don't think any human being has ever said, look at this sun tee view

21:54.660 --> 22:00.660
What is sun tee? I don't drink tea, what is sun tee?

22:00.660 --> 22:03.660
Sun tee is where you just make slow tea in the sun

22:03.660 --> 22:06.660
You let the sun heat up your gross water

22:06.660 --> 22:08.660
So it's not a thing then, right?

22:08.660 --> 22:10.660
No, it's a thing, what do you mean it's not a thing?

22:10.660 --> 22:12.660
Sun tee?

22:12.660 --> 22:14.660
Yes, everybody's googling this

22:14.660 --> 22:17.660
You put multiple tea bags in a picture and you put it in the sun

22:17.660 --> 22:18.660
Oh, you're right, you're right

22:18.660 --> 22:19.660
You put it in the sun

22:19.660 --> 22:20.660
Okay, sorry

22:20.660 --> 22:21.660
Did you just Google it?

22:21.660 --> 22:22.660
Yeah, I Googled it, I'm sorry

22:22.660 --> 22:24.660
Where's the trust, you know?

22:26.660 --> 22:29.660
Is there something with kazoo?

22:29.660 --> 22:30.660
No

22:30.660 --> 22:32.660
Banjo kazoo

22:32.660 --> 22:36.660
Banjo 20 kazoo

22:36.660 --> 22:40.660
That was a really good banjo kazoo

22:40.660 --> 22:42.660
20 Scooby Doo

22:42.660 --> 22:43.660
No

22:43.660 --> 22:49.660
All right, is it the time in the episode where we take a step away and say

22:49.660 --> 22:53.660
What do we want to embody?

22:53.660 --> 22:56.660
Well, have we put up all our suggestions?

22:56.660 --> 23:03.660
No, no, no, no, I think this will help spread a little fertilizer around on the feet

23:03.660 --> 23:13.660
It is important to me, kidding aside, it is important to me that it be somewhat either motivational or aspirational

23:13.660 --> 23:15.660
In a way that gets you pumped for this year

23:15.660 --> 23:19.660
Because I don't want, everybody, this is one of the years of your life, right?

23:19.660 --> 23:23.660
You don't want to assign it to negativity this early

23:23.660 --> 23:26.660
You will get there for sure, but you got to start fresh

23:26.660 --> 23:29.660
But let me add this, because I agree with you, I do agree with you

23:29.660 --> 23:36.660
But is there a way that we can embody, because in the past I feel like we've embodied like a naive kind of hope

23:36.660 --> 23:44.660
Is there a way now that we're doing like a, this is a mature, this is a, it's still there, right?

23:44.660 --> 23:48.660
This is hope for sure, but this is a cautious, powerful hope, you know what I mean?

23:48.660 --> 23:53.660
Yeah, that's interesting, Travis, because I would say a weakness of

23:53.660 --> 24:01.660
Skipping 2020, which I think we can all agree, that year's motto, both of them were complete fuck ups

24:01.660 --> 24:07.660
2019 and 2021, we have become the monster and big dog run

24:07.660 --> 24:13.660
Like those are both very strong, but it was also like, get the most powerful and aggro

24:13.660 --> 24:16.660
And that like, I don't necessarily think that's us

24:16.660 --> 24:21.660
There are very few times in my life where I'm like, let's become the monster, baby

24:21.660 --> 24:28.660
Because I'm, we are, we are, we are meeker than that, I would say

24:28.660 --> 24:31.660
Two thirds of us definitely are

24:31.660 --> 24:35.660
Yeah, so instead of it being like, let's go baby

24:35.660 --> 24:39.660
Have it be like, maybe don't be so timid

24:39.660 --> 24:44.660
Maybe don't be as timid as you usually are and take a shot, you know?

24:44.660 --> 24:50.660
Like, not like, get it and win the game, but like, get in the game

24:50.660 --> 24:53.660
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah

24:53.660 --> 24:56.660
20 something new

24:56.660 --> 24:58.660
20 something new

24:58.660 --> 25:01.660
It's just not, it's not very clever

25:01.660 --> 25:03.660
It's not specific, there's not enough specificity to it

25:03.660 --> 25:05.660
Let me hit you guys with this

25:05.660 --> 25:06.660
Yeah

25:06.660 --> 25:08.660
Because I've been saving it, this isn't my last one

25:08.660 --> 25:09.660
Oh fuck

25:09.660 --> 25:14.660
When it came to me, I was like, oh, mama, like that

25:14.660 --> 25:20.660
This is so exciting because this could either be the moment where Justin says the thing that like

25:20.660 --> 25:22.660
Well, I have one more, Justin, do you want me to do?

25:22.660 --> 25:23.660
Please do yours

25:23.660 --> 25:26.660
Okay, 20 looky-loo on the horizon

25:26.660 --> 25:32.660
I don't like the phonetics of looky-loo makes me feel bad

25:32.660 --> 25:33.660
Okay, okay

25:33.660 --> 25:34.660
I don't like saying it

25:34.660 --> 25:35.660
That means something

25:35.660 --> 25:36.660
Yeah

25:36.660 --> 25:38.660
Did you guys watch that Beatles documentary?

25:38.660 --> 25:41.660
Because it's dope, because they'd just be like noodling, like Scooby-Doo-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop

25:41.660 --> 25:43.660
Hey, is this anything?

25:43.660 --> 25:44.660
Scooby-Doo-bop-bop-bop

25:44.660 --> 25:45.660
No, that's not anything

25:45.660 --> 25:46.660
What about this?

25:46.660 --> 25:47.660
Get back to where you once

25:47.660 --> 25:49.660
And it's like, oh fuck, you guys just wrote get back

25:49.660 --> 25:53.660
That's the moment we're at right now when Justin's about to say the thing that's like his get back

25:53.660 --> 25:54.660
Okay

25:56.660 --> 25:59.660
20 mummy crew back from the dead

25:59.660 --> 26:00.660
Huh

26:00.660 --> 26:02.660
20 mummy crew

26:04.660 --> 26:06.660
What this is about is two things

26:06.660 --> 26:07.660
Okay

26:07.660 --> 26:09.660
One, back from the dead

26:09.660 --> 26:10.660
Yes

26:10.660 --> 26:11.660
Okay

26:11.660 --> 26:12.660
Yeah

26:12.660 --> 26:13.660
Well

26:13.660 --> 26:14.660
Fair, right?

26:14.660 --> 26:17.660
We've been ground down to a paste

26:17.660 --> 26:18.660
Yeah

26:18.660 --> 26:21.660
But it's also about, so it's about coming back from that

26:21.660 --> 26:22.660
Yeah

26:22.660 --> 26:23.660
But it's also about community

26:23.660 --> 26:24.660
Oh

26:24.660 --> 26:28.660
Because you look at anybody else that's with you, they're a mummy too

26:28.660 --> 26:29.660
You're in the mummy crew

26:29.660 --> 26:31.660
What about 20 mummy too?

26:32.660 --> 26:34.660
20 mummy crew back from the dead

26:34.660 --> 26:42.660
The idea of mummy crew, obviously Justin, is one of the best things you've ever sort of generated

26:42.660 --> 26:43.660
Yes, correct

26:43.660 --> 26:45.660
One of the best pieces of content you've ever created

26:45.660 --> 26:47.660
It's up there with your two children who I love very much

26:47.660 --> 26:48.660
20 mummy crew

26:48.660 --> 26:56.660
The idea of us, instead of calling our audience Mbimbambinos or, you know, Mbimbambnation

26:56.660 --> 27:01.660
The idea of them just being the mummy crew is so fucking strong

27:01.660 --> 27:06.660
I tell you, I don't like having the word dead in the motto

27:06.660 --> 27:08.660
Because that feels a little bit

27:08.660 --> 27:09.660
We're back from the dead

27:09.660 --> 27:10.660
Yeah

27:10.660 --> 27:11.660
Right

27:11.660 --> 27:15.660
Not why, but I do think that there's something, maybe it's 20 mummy crew, rise again

27:15.660 --> 27:19.660
Or 20 mummy crew, straight out the tomb

27:19.660 --> 27:21.660
Is that better?

27:21.660 --> 27:23.660
Better than dead

27:23.660 --> 27:25.660
20 mummy crew, arise my love

27:25.660 --> 27:26.660
Hmm

27:26.660 --> 27:27.660
That's interesting

27:27.660 --> 27:28.660
Something for the Baptists

27:28.660 --> 27:30.660
Something for the Baptists

27:30.660 --> 27:33.660
20 mummy crew

27:33.660 --> 27:35.660
Sarcophagit it

27:35.660 --> 27:36.660
Ooh

27:36.660 --> 27:37.660
Sarcophagit it

27:37.660 --> 27:38.660
Ooh

27:38.660 --> 27:40.660
If we hadn't already done getting it, I would

27:40.660 --> 27:41.660
Yeah

27:41.660 --> 27:48.660
I do love, by the way, the juxtaposition of me saying maybe tone it down to a more reasonable, let's not be so timid thing

27:48.660 --> 27:54.660
And then Justin was like, alley-oop, 20 mummy crew, rise from the dead, back from the dead

27:54.660 --> 27:59.660
It feels, also Juice, can I tell you a genuine concern of mine

27:59.660 --> 28:02.660
And this is something I had a few ideas that I immediately shot down in my head

28:02.660 --> 28:09.660
It feels a little bit like the Post Malone Jägermeister commercial

28:09.660 --> 28:15.660
Where he's back at the bar and it's empty and the bartender's like, it's empty because of COVID

28:15.660 --> 28:18.660
But then he's like, dummy, we're better now

28:18.660 --> 28:22.660
And he walks out in the street with a bottle of Jägermeister and then the place is packed

28:22.660 --> 28:25.660
And he's like, we worked hard for this, let's celebrate

28:25.660 --> 28:29.660
And then it's like, a month later, it's like, uh-oh, I'm gonna cry

28:29.660 --> 28:30.660
No, don't

28:30.660 --> 28:35.660
I worry about it being like, 20, rise from the dead, baby, it's back

28:35.660 --> 28:41.660
Go buy a Toyota truck, Toyota Nation, because we are here and we've waited long enough

28:41.660 --> 28:43.660
Okay, okay, okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait

28:43.660 --> 28:47.660
Along those lines, 20 mummy crew, lying in wait

28:47.660 --> 28:48.660
No

28:48.660 --> 28:49.660
Right, because the mummy's there

28:49.660 --> 28:51.660
Way too passive, way too passive

28:51.660 --> 28:52.660
Way too passive

28:52.660 --> 28:57.660
I want something that says, we're not doing it now, but we, ooh, moments notice, you know what I mean?

28:57.660 --> 29:02.660
If you want that, then get 20 yummy stews, something's cooking

29:02.660 --> 29:06.660
Mmm, can we do 20 mummy crew, something's cooking

29:06.660 --> 29:08.660
20 mummy stew

29:08.660 --> 29:11.660
20 mummy

29:11.660 --> 29:13.660
I'll be, can I be honest?

29:13.660 --> 29:16.660
I feel like, of the things that we have

29:16.660 --> 29:20.660
I feel like, I love the tagline, put it in the pot, a lot

29:20.660 --> 29:23.660
I like the concept of mummies though

29:23.660 --> 29:28.660
It is equivalent in my mind to like, don't hide your light under a bushel

29:28.660 --> 29:32.660
Put it out there and let it become better

29:32.660 --> 29:37.660
By becoming more fragrant and mixing around with the other stuff

29:37.660 --> 29:43.660
To me that, and maybe we're getting, maybe that's trending a little too close to collaboratine

29:43.660 --> 29:48.660
But even put it in the pot feels a little bit more achievable than go find a collaborator

29:48.660 --> 29:52.660
So 20 mummy stew, 20 mummy stew put it in the pot?

29:52.660 --> 29:56.660
20 mummy crew, together we rise

29:56.660 --> 30:01.660
That feels, again, we're getting close to like a presidential campaign

30:01.660 --> 30:02.660
Well

30:02.660 --> 30:03.660
For mummies

30:03.660 --> 30:05.660
I have been waiting to announce

30:05.660 --> 30:10.660
20 mummy crew pyramid dreams, is that anything?

30:10.660 --> 30:11.660
Ooh

30:11.660 --> 30:20.660
Now we're getting into cult territory again, I feel like if we start leaning into pyramids, like symbology and shit

30:20.660 --> 30:22.660
20 mummy crew

30:22.660 --> 30:23.660
Under wraps

30:23.660 --> 30:24.660
No

30:24.660 --> 30:25.660
20 mummy crew

30:25.660 --> 30:26.660
No

30:26.660 --> 30:28.660
Wrap it up, it's about safe sex

30:28.660 --> 30:29.660
That could be fun

30:29.660 --> 30:33.660
I think if you don't, here's what I would say, if you don't have something about resurrection in there

30:33.660 --> 30:37.660
Then, mummy crew stew

30:37.660 --> 30:38.660
20 mummy crew

30:38.660 --> 30:39.660
Sounds very strange

30:39.660 --> 30:41.660
Yeah, I guess so

30:41.660 --> 30:42.660
Mmm

30:42.660 --> 30:44.660
Um

30:44.660 --> 30:48.660
20, oh shit

30:48.660 --> 30:51.660
What if, guys

30:51.660 --> 30:55.660
What if we get really, really focused

30:55.660 --> 30:56.660
Okay

30:56.660 --> 30:59.660
On

30:59.660 --> 31:02.660
Bringing back

31:02.660 --> 31:06.660
Brendan Fraser's The Mummy series

31:06.660 --> 31:09.660
And so 20 mummy crew

31:09.660 --> 31:11.660
Is us

31:11.660 --> 31:14.660
Really pounding the pavement

31:14.660 --> 31:18.660
To get Brendan Fraser's The Mummy 4

31:18.660 --> 31:19.660
Yeah

31:19.660 --> 31:21.660
Yeah, it would be the fourth mummy

31:21.660 --> 31:22.660
Off the ground

31:22.660 --> 31:24.660
But you have to not count the Tom Cruise mummy

31:24.660 --> 31:25.660
No, of course not

31:25.660 --> 31:26.660
Of course I don't count the fucking Tom Cruise mummy

31:26.660 --> 31:29.660
And we're bringing back Rachel Weisz, I don't care

31:29.660 --> 31:32.660
Rachel Weisz

31:32.660 --> 31:35.660
Rachel Weisz

31:35.660 --> 31:42.660
Now Justin, you say it's unattainable, but I would argue that it is more attainable than us all becoming big dogs

31:42.660 --> 31:44.660
I think if Brendan Fraser

31:44.660 --> 31:47.660
I think if Rachel Weisz hears a knock at the door

31:47.660 --> 31:50.660
And she opens it and Brendan Fraser's standing there

31:50.660 --> 31:51.660
Yeah

31:51.660 --> 31:53.660
She puts on her coat

31:53.660 --> 31:57.660
And walks outside and follows him, no, like, no words exchanged

31:57.660 --> 31:58.660
Just like, yes

31:58.660 --> 31:59.660
Correct

31:59.660 --> 32:00.660
Yep

32:00.660 --> 32:01.660
It's time

32:01.660 --> 32:03.660
I don't, I don't, I don't want to do this

32:03.660 --> 32:05.660
You don't want to bring back

32:05.660 --> 32:06.660
No, I don't want to bring back

32:06.660 --> 32:07.660
This is going to be the one

32:07.660 --> 32:09.660
Brendan's doing a lot of great work in a lot of different fields

32:09.660 --> 32:10.660
Yeah

32:10.660 --> 32:11.660
So, so good

32:11.660 --> 32:12.660
I don't want to disrupt him

32:12.660 --> 32:13.660
In Doom Squad

32:13.660 --> 32:14.660
Now here's the thing, Justin

32:14.660 --> 32:18.660
I want you to just brace yourself that this is going to be the one that everyone is going to be like

32:18.660 --> 32:22.660
I can't believe you guys didn't commit to bringing back The Mummy

32:22.660 --> 32:23.660
The original series

32:23.660 --> 32:26.660
I don't think so, because most people, we are

32:26.660 --> 32:29.660
The funny thing about that is we are

32:29.660 --> 32:33.660
A hundred million light years from having the juice to get that done, a hundred percent

32:33.660 --> 32:34.660
It's not even close

32:34.660 --> 32:39.660
And most of our listeners are probably even more unable to bring back The Mummy

32:39.660 --> 32:41.660
I think everybody working together

32:41.660 --> 32:43.660
And you know what the other problem with that is?

32:43.660 --> 32:47.660
Even if we do it, it doesn't benefit us enough

32:47.660 --> 32:48.660
Okay, first of all, Justin

32:48.660 --> 32:49.660
I've watched The Mummy

32:49.660 --> 32:55.660
All you got to do to bring back The Mummy is like disrupt The Tomb or some shit, right?

32:55.660 --> 32:58.660
And then the movie, mostly The Mummy brings itself back

32:58.660 --> 33:03.660
What about, okay, 20 Mummy Crew, a Nox and a Moon

33:03.660 --> 33:04.660
What do you think?

33:04.660 --> 33:05.660
Is that anything?

33:05.660 --> 33:07.660
Is that like a spell?

33:07.660 --> 33:09.660
No, that was the name of the woman

33:09.660 --> 33:12.660
It could be badass to have a spell in our year slogan

33:12.660 --> 33:14.660
That like makes a magical thing happen

33:14.660 --> 33:16.660
You know, Travis, you just said

33:16.660 --> 33:19.660
20, 20, 20 viewers skew!

33:19.660 --> 33:21.660
Let's meet Kevin Smith

33:21.660 --> 33:22.660
That's attainable

33:22.660 --> 33:23.660
That's fun

33:23.660 --> 33:30.660
I feel like Travis said something not realizing the power inside of his incantation

33:30.660 --> 33:33.660
And that was disrupt The Tomb

33:33.660 --> 33:36.660
20 Mummy Crew disrupt The Tomb

33:36.660 --> 33:46.660
The idea of like, of taking these sacred, you know, idols

33:46.660 --> 33:48.660
Shaking them up a little bit

33:48.660 --> 33:49.660
Disrupt The Tomb

33:49.660 --> 33:50.660
Let's try something

33:50.660 --> 33:52.660
Now there is a lot of colonialism associated with that

33:52.660 --> 33:56.660
There is a huge, there's a huge

33:56.660 --> 34:02.660
It's unthinkable, unthinkable that you would even suggest it

34:02.660 --> 34:06.660
Wait, we're canceled mid podcast, we haven't even published

34:06.660 --> 34:09.660
No, it's NBC guys, they canceled us again

34:09.660 --> 34:10.660
Whoop

34:10.660 --> 34:11.660
Whoop

34:11.660 --> 34:13.660
Alright, don't disrupt The Tomb, fuck

34:13.660 --> 34:15.660
20 Mummy Crew

34:15.660 --> 34:16.660
20 viewers skew

34:16.660 --> 34:18.660
Buried with cats

34:18.660 --> 34:21.660
Buried with cats

34:21.660 --> 34:24.660
20 running

34:24.660 --> 34:29.660
Running is something, running is a word that could potentially go in there

34:29.660 --> 34:31.660
I mean 20 running crew

34:31.660 --> 34:33.660
That's nothing Travis

34:33.660 --> 34:35.660
20 running shoo

34:35.660 --> 34:36.660
20 running goo

34:36.660 --> 34:37.660
20 running shoo?

34:37.660 --> 34:40.660
Guys, you guys feel like we're in the weeds right now?

34:40.660 --> 34:42.660
This is where I feel like our power lies

34:42.660 --> 34:45.660
Is deep in the trash heat

34:45.660 --> 34:46.660
When we just start saying

34:46.660 --> 34:48.660
20 cunning shrew

34:48.660 --> 34:49.660
What?

34:49.660 --> 34:50.660
Like a cunning shrew

34:50.660 --> 34:52.660
It's okay Justin, this is part of the process

34:52.660 --> 34:55.660
This is how we get to Big Dog Run, you know what I mean?

34:55.660 --> 34:58.660
Wait, what about 20 Mummy Crew emerge?

34:58.660 --> 34:59.660
Emerge

34:59.660 --> 35:03.660
Escape the grave

35:03.660 --> 35:05.660
20 Mummy Crew, shame the grave

35:05.660 --> 35:08.660
Shame the grave

35:08.660 --> 35:14.660
It would be dumb if we just had a year of unabashed hedonism

35:14.660 --> 35:19.660
20 Mummy Crew, death is only the beginning

35:19.660 --> 35:21.660
Oh man

35:21.660 --> 35:25.660
Maybe we should go to the money zone just as like a palette cleanser

35:25.660 --> 35:29.660
And when we come back have sort of fresh eyes

35:29.660 --> 35:30.660
And then we'll read through them again

35:30.660 --> 35:32.660
This will be the whole, okay great

35:32.660 --> 35:36.660
Great, actually, that's actually a great idea

35:36.660 --> 35:37.660
Yeah

35:37.660 --> 35:39.660
Cause I'm looking at this list guys

35:39.660 --> 35:42.660
And it's maybe our worst list ever

35:42.660 --> 35:45.660
But I think maybe we're just too close to it

35:45.660 --> 35:51.660
I think we're way too close to it

35:51.660 --> 35:53.660
It's better with you

35:53.660 --> 35:55.660
It's better with you

35:55.660 --> 35:57.660
Bombus

35:57.660 --> 35:58.660
Boom

35:58.660 --> 35:59.660
Watch your language

35:59.660 --> 36:01.660
It's right there, Bombus

36:01.660 --> 36:02.660
The mission is simple

36:02.660 --> 36:04.660
Make the most comfortable clothes ever

36:04.660 --> 36:06.660
And match every item sold

36:06.660 --> 36:07.660
So when you buy Bombus

36:07.660 --> 36:09.660
You are also giving to someone who's in need

36:09.660 --> 36:11.660
You guys, I'm wearing Bombus socks right now

36:11.660 --> 36:12.660
Whoa, me too

36:12.660 --> 36:13.660
What?

36:13.660 --> 36:15.660
Yep, you can tell cause of how comfortable I am

36:15.660 --> 36:17.660
I'm not wearing socks cause I stepped in something wet earlier

36:17.660 --> 36:19.660
And had to take the wet sock off

36:19.660 --> 36:21.660
Oh man, that's the worst

36:21.660 --> 36:23.660
Did you know what the wetness was Griffin?

36:23.660 --> 36:24.660
Or was it mystery wet?

36:24.660 --> 36:27.660
Rarely do I know what the wetness was

36:27.660 --> 36:29.660
Oh, that's the thing man

36:29.660 --> 36:31.660
I got two dogs and a potty training toddler

36:31.660 --> 36:33.660
It could be anything

36:33.660 --> 36:35.660
Okay, they also make shirts and underwear

36:35.660 --> 36:37.660
And oh my god

36:37.660 --> 36:38.660
These are incredible

36:38.660 --> 36:39.660
It's my favorite shirt

36:39.660 --> 36:40.660
My favorite t-shirt

36:40.660 --> 36:41.660
It's made by Bombus

36:41.660 --> 36:42.660
I said it

36:42.660 --> 36:44.660
Everything they make is soft, seamless, tagless

36:44.660 --> 36:47.660
And with a luxury, cozy feel

36:47.660 --> 36:49.660
And they're made from stuff like marino wool

36:49.660 --> 36:50.660
And pima cotton

36:50.660 --> 36:51.660
And even cashmere

36:51.660 --> 36:53.660
Which all sound so fancy

36:53.660 --> 36:55.660
And make you feel fancy

36:55.660 --> 36:58.660
And so they're perfect, cozy, winter layers

Hey gamers, level up those clothes

37:18.660 --> 37:21.660
Hey gamers, it's time to level up your fashion

37:21.660 --> 37:25.660
A lot of people think that we might get to leave our houses this year

37:25.660 --> 37:26.660
It's impossible to say

37:26.660 --> 37:27.660
But you want to be ready

37:27.660 --> 37:29.660
When we're allowed to leave our houses

37:29.660 --> 37:31.660
There's going to be a rush in the clothing stores like you wouldn't believe

37:31.660 --> 37:35.660
But you could have your fashion already ready to go with the power of SitFix

37:35.660 --> 37:37.660

Or call it Stitch Fix because that's what it's called

37:47.660 --> 37:48.660
Rich Fix

37:48.660 --> 37:49.660

37:49.660 --> 37:51.660
Rick's Fix

37:51.660 --> 37:53.660
They got a new thing, Stitch Fix Freestyle

37:53.660 --> 37:55.660
Oh Justin, I'm too far into rhyming

37:55.660 --> 37:56.660
Oh no

37:56.660 --> 37:57.660
No, no, no

37:57.660 --> 37:59.660
Yeah, you got to disengage that part of your brain

38:39.660 --> 38:40.660
You're in a theater

38:40.660 --> 38:41.660
The lights go down

38:41.660 --> 38:44.660
You're about to get swept up by the characters

38:44.660 --> 38:47.660
And all their little details and interpersonal dramas

38:47.660 --> 38:48.660
You look at them and think

38:48.660 --> 38:51.660
That person is so obviously in love with their best friend

38:51.660 --> 38:53.660
Wait, am I in love with my best friend?

38:53.660 --> 38:55.660
That character's mom is so overbearing

38:55.660 --> 38:56.660
Why doesn't she just stand up to her?

38:56.660 --> 38:59.660
Oh God, do I need to stand up to my own mother?

38:59.660 --> 39:01.660
If you've ever recognized yourself in a movie

39:01.660 --> 39:05.660
Then join me, Jordan Cruciola, for the podcast Feeling Seen

39:05.660 --> 39:08.660
We've talked to author Susan Orlean on realizing her own marriage was falling apart

39:08.660 --> 39:12.660
After watching Adaptation, an adaptation of her own work

39:12.660 --> 39:19.660
And comedian Hari Kondabolu on why Harold and Kumar was a depressingly important movie for Southeast Asians

39:19.660 --> 39:24.660
So join me every Thursday for the Feeling Seen podcast here on Maximum Fun

39:27.660 --> 39:28.660
I'm Lisa Hanawalt

39:28.660 --> 39:29.660
And I'm Emily Heller

39:29.660 --> 39:33.660
Nine years ago, we started a podcast to try and learn something new every episode

39:33.660 --> 39:36.660
Things have gone a little off the rails since then

39:36.660 --> 39:37.660
Tune in to hear about

39:37.660 --> 39:39.660
Low stakes neighborhood drama

39:39.660 --> 39:40.660
Gardening

39:40.660 --> 39:43.660
The sordid, nasty underbelly of the horse girl lifestyle

39:43.660 --> 39:44.660
Hot sauce

39:44.660 --> 39:48.660
Addiction to TV and sweaty takes on celebrity culture

39:48.660 --> 39:52.660
And the weirdest, grossest stuff you can find on wikipedia.org

39:52.660 --> 39:54.660
We'll read all of it, no matter how gross

39:54.660 --> 39:57.660
There's something for everyone on our podcast, Baby Geniuses

39:57.660 --> 40:00.660
Hosted by us, two horny adult idiots

40:00.660 --> 40:04.660
Hang out with us as we try and fail to retain any knowledge at all

40:04.660 --> 40:06.660
Every other week on Maximum Fun

40:06.660 --> 40:09.660
Baby Geniuses, tell us something we don't know

40:14.660 --> 40:15.660
Is there a new one on the list?

40:15.660 --> 40:17.660
Yeah, there's just this new one right here

40:17.660 --> 40:19.660
Someone put that on there

40:19.660 --> 40:20.660
What's it say, Griffin?

40:20.660 --> 40:23.660
22 the Dew brought to you by Mountain Dew by Hot Blast

40:23.660 --> 40:27.660
You know, it's funny you say that

40:27.660 --> 40:32.660
I was actually thinking, I wish we would sell the rights

40:32.660 --> 40:35.660
Like the branding rights, you know what I mean, to this thing

40:35.660 --> 40:36.660
Oh, that's fun

40:36.660 --> 40:37.660
I wish we did that

40:37.660 --> 40:40.660
Well, this is a cold shot kind of selling it

40:40.660 --> 40:42.660
Where we would name it that

40:42.660 --> 40:48.660
And then get retroactively reimbursed for it

40:48.660 --> 40:49.660
Yeah, and it would need to be a brand

40:49.660 --> 40:51.660
It couldn't be like 20 Long John Silvers

40:51.660 --> 40:52.660
No

40:52.660 --> 40:54.660
Enjoy our crispy fish

40:54.660 --> 40:59.660
Okay, just to sort of expand our mind a little bit

40:59.660 --> 41:02.660
I am on rhyme zone looking at three syllable rhymes with ew

41:02.660 --> 41:03.660
I did that as well, yes

41:03.660 --> 41:05.660
Okay, so there's some stuff in here

41:05.660 --> 41:13.660
Just like 20 BBQ, 20 Black and Blue, 20 Brunswick Stew

41:13.660 --> 41:17.660
20 Brunswick Stew, that means even less than some of the ones we already had

41:17.660 --> 41:20.660
I have two, can I throw out two that I thought of just as more thought starters?

41:20.660 --> 41:21.660
Yeah, sure, sure

41:21.660 --> 41:25.660
20 Cordon Bleu, Cookin' Fancy

41:25.660 --> 41:27.660
Okay

41:27.660 --> 41:30.660
And 20 something blue, Tie the Knot

41:30.660 --> 41:33.660
This is interesting, we're getting even farther

41:33.660 --> 41:36.660
That's fine, Juice, we have to get perspective, you know?

41:36.660 --> 41:40.660
God is watching us from a distance, 20 Deja Vu

41:40.660 --> 41:42.660
20 Broader View

41:42.660 --> 41:45.660
20 Point of View

41:45.660 --> 41:46.660
20 Point of View

41:46.660 --> 41:47.660
Is nothing

41:47.660 --> 41:48.660
Meaningless

41:48.660 --> 41:50.660
Meaningless

41:50.660 --> 41:56.660
Now, 20 Deja Vu, one more again, is not bad

41:56.660 --> 42:02.660
Let me, I had a thought while I was recording the podcast

42:02.660 --> 42:03.660
Yeah, sure

42:03.660 --> 42:06.660
2020 Dew, Second Chances

42:06.660 --> 42:09.660
Huh, here's what it is

42:09.660 --> 42:13.660
2020, we messed up pretty bad

42:13.660 --> 42:15.660
As a species, we whiffed it

42:15.660 --> 42:19.660
It was going to be cool too, like that number was really a cool number

42:19.660 --> 42:20.660
Yeah

42:20.660 --> 42:25.660
But 2020 Dew, what that suggests is, let's try again

42:25.660 --> 42:26.660
Let's try again

42:26.660 --> 42:31.660
You can do 2020 again, but better, Second Chances, 2020 Dew

42:31.660 --> 42:32.660
Okay

42:32.660 --> 42:33.660
20 Debar Dew

42:33.660 --> 42:35.660
It's also kind of continental too

42:35.660 --> 42:36.660
Yeah, sure

42:36.660 --> 42:37.660
You know what I mean? Kind of fancy

42:37.660 --> 42:44.660
Yeah, because what it is that you are saying is, to translate, just for our friends who don't speak French, is 2022

42:44.660 --> 42:45.660
Yeah

42:45.660 --> 42:46.660
Right

42:46.660 --> 42:49.660
It's also, Justin, if I may, would be the laziest one

42:49.660 --> 42:50.660
You may, you may, you may

42:50.660 --> 42:54.660
It's the laziest one we could have possibly done

42:54.660 --> 42:58.660
No, actually 2022 would have been lazier, and that was my initial thought

42:58.660 --> 43:01.660
But I kind of do like 2022 as a name

43:01.660 --> 43:02.660
Like TOO?

43:02.660 --> 43:03.660
No

43:03.660 --> 43:04.660
No?

43:04.660 --> 43:06.660
TWO, the number

43:06.660 --> 43:07.660
Huh

43:07.660 --> 43:08.660
That's cool, I like that

43:08.660 --> 43:09.660
Is it?

43:09.660 --> 43:13.660
Let's do it again, let's try it better

43:13.660 --> 43:15.660
2022, a year of sequels

43:15.660 --> 43:19.660
20 Pikaboo, here we are

43:19.660 --> 43:21.660
20 Pikachu

43:21.660 --> 43:22.660
20 Pikachu

43:22.660 --> 43:25.660
20 Pikachu, electric mouth

43:25.660 --> 43:29.660
20 electric boogaloo

43:29.660 --> 43:32.660
20 Pikachu, don't evolve

43:32.660 --> 43:33.660
Oh

43:33.660 --> 43:36.660
That's kind of a fun

43:36.660 --> 43:40.660
20 Rendezvous, good evening

43:40.660 --> 43:41.660
Oh

43:41.660 --> 43:43.660
Oh

43:43.660 --> 43:48.660
This is a phase that I think we go in where we see how hard we can whiff

43:48.660 --> 43:53.660
20, no I'm sorry, 20 Rendezvous, good evening, it's very good

43:53.660 --> 43:57.660
20 Rendezvous, hello there

43:57.660 --> 44:01.660
20 Rendezvous, on the veranda

44:01.660 --> 44:05.660
20 Rendezvous, I see you there

44:05.660 --> 44:08.660
20 Rendezvous, to the veranda

44:08.660 --> 44:09.660
To the veranda

44:09.660 --> 44:14.660
20 Rendezvous, a nighttime affair

44:14.660 --> 44:20.660
20 Rendezvous, a night to remember, and we just do it like a senior prom

44:20.660 --> 44:23.660
All you need to do is have one good night

44:23.660 --> 44:24.660
Just one good night

44:24.660 --> 44:27.660
Just have one good night

44:27.660 --> 44:33.660
Then at all of our live shows we'll set up a photo, like set up a prom photo booth

44:33.660 --> 44:37.660
And we will have all teams a night to remember

44:37.660 --> 44:42.660
Guys, I'm kind of hooked on 20 Rendezvous, a night to remember

44:47.660 --> 44:51.660
I think it's very close

44:51.660 --> 44:54.660
I think a night to remember is a little

44:54.660 --> 44:59.660
I think it's hitting like a walk to remember, maybe it's just 20 Rendezvous, a walk to remember

44:59.660 --> 45:01.660
A walk to remember

45:01.660 --> 45:08.660
No, Rendezvous, I like the class the night to remember brings, it also sounds like we're picking a prom theme

45:08.660 --> 45:09.660
Which is very fucking to me

45:09.660 --> 45:11.660
Enchantment in the evening

45:11.660 --> 45:13.660
20 Rendezvous

45:13.660 --> 45:15.660
Enchanté

45:15.660 --> 45:16.660
20

45:16.660 --> 45:17.660
Too hard to spell

45:17.660 --> 45:18.660
So is Rendezvous

45:18.660 --> 45:20.660
Yeah, we need to talk about that for a second

45:20.660 --> 45:23.660
Do we just want to expect people to learn

45:23.660 --> 45:25.660
How to spell Rendezvous

45:25.660 --> 45:28.660
How to spell Rendezvous, okay, nobody look

45:28.660 --> 45:30.660
Travis

45:30.660 --> 45:32.660
Griffin, spell Rendezvous

45:32.660 --> 45:36.660
R-E-N-D-E-V-O-U-Z

45:36.660 --> 45:37.660
Incorrect

45:37.660 --> 45:38.660
Say it again

45:38.660 --> 45:45.660
R-E-N-D-E-V-O

45:45.660 --> 45:46.660
Griffin

45:46.660 --> 45:55.660
R, I know Travis got the first five letters right, R-E-N-D-E-Z

45:55.660 --> 45:58.660
That seems like a weird pick

45:58.660 --> 46:00.660
You sure you want to go with Z

46:00.660 --> 46:07.660
R-E-N-D-E-S-V-O-U-Z

46:07.660 --> 46:10.660
It's R-E-N-D-E-Z-V-O-U-S

46:10.660 --> 46:12.660
Oh, so I was right and you were

46:12.660 --> 46:14.660
Yeah, but if you could be shaken from it, you didn't know

46:14.660 --> 46:16.660
Yeah, you didn't have it

46:16.660 --> 46:18.660
You were guessing

46:18.660 --> 46:22.660
That is tricky, I do feel like it robs it of a little bit of

46:22.660 --> 46:26.660
But maybe this would be something that we could concretely take away from it

46:26.660 --> 46:28.660
Is that everybody would learn how to spell one word

46:28.660 --> 46:31.660
That is true, that is an actual thing

46:31.660 --> 46:34.660
I'm working on spelling restaurant right the first time every time

46:34.660 --> 46:40.660
And so having that like, this is not only a good, obviously great motto

46:40.660 --> 46:43.660
But also a powerful learning experience

46:43.660 --> 46:49.660
Okay, earlier in this very episode you did say that you wanted it to be motivational or aspirational

46:49.660 --> 46:50.660
This is

46:50.660 --> 46:56.660
What does 20 rendezvous, a night to remember mean

46:56.660 --> 47:00.660
It's like saying, hey, make the most of it, grab this opportunity, this is a night to remember

47:00.660 --> 47:02.660
What if it's during the day though

47:02.660 --> 47:08.660
We could even make it more specific, which is like out of 365 chances

47:08.660 --> 47:11.660
Have like one night to remember

47:11.660 --> 47:13.660
That doesn't feel strong enough

47:13.660 --> 47:15.660
I feel like 20 rendezvous is good

47:15.660 --> 47:19.660
I feel like a night to remember could be stronger

47:19.660 --> 47:21.660
I am shaken by the spelling

47:21.660 --> 47:23.660
Okay, alright

47:23.660 --> 47:27.660
I'm a little bit shaken by the spelling thing, it robs it of some of its power to me

47:27.660 --> 47:29.660
Now we could, let me just, one more thing

47:29.660 --> 47:35.660
Just if we wanted to do perhaps our biggest cold shot ever in 13 years

47:35.660 --> 47:36.660
Fuck

47:36.660 --> 47:40.660
20 rendezvous, meeting in person

47:40.660 --> 47:43.660
That's cool, yeah there's nothing wrong with that right now

47:43.660 --> 47:45.660
Yeah, loaded, a little bit loaded

47:45.660 --> 47:46.660
How about this

47:46.660 --> 47:50.660
20 Jenny Sue, you get on out to that corn patch and feed them piggies

47:50.660 --> 47:52.660
Now, okay

47:52.660 --> 47:56.660
So once again, just cause, 20 Jenny Sue

47:56.660 --> 47:59.660
You get on out to that corn patch and feed them piggies

47:59.660 --> 48:00.660
Yeah

48:00.660 --> 48:03.660
20 Peggy Sue

48:03.660 --> 48:05.660
20 Jenny Sue, cause it rhymes with 20

48:05.660 --> 48:06.660
No I get that

48:06.660 --> 48:10.660
20 Jenny Sue, get on out to that corn patch and feed them piggies

48:10.660 --> 48:13.660
20 Peggy Sue, ooey oo, I look just like Buddy Holly

48:13.660 --> 48:18.660
Maybe, 20 ooey ooey ooey

48:18.660 --> 48:19.660
Does 20

48:19.660 --> 48:21.660
Wait, is that it? Wait, wait, wait, was that it?

48:21.660 --> 48:22.660
Ooey ooey ooey

48:22.660 --> 48:23.660
20 ooey ooey ooey

48:23.660 --> 48:28.660
20 ooey ooey ooey, that's a spicy one

48:28.660 --> 48:29.660
20 ooey ooey ooey, yummo

48:29.660 --> 48:31.660
20 ooey ooey ooey, a spicy one

48:31.660 --> 48:35.660
Oh, 20 ooey ooey ooey ooey, doo wop's back

48:35.660 --> 48:38.660
Uh, 20 switcheroo

48:38.660 --> 48:41.660
20 switcheroo, 20 switcheroo

48:41.660 --> 48:46.660
Ah, no, that doesn't, that doesn't, that doesn't, that doesn't, that provides no direction

48:46.660 --> 48:50.660
What about 20, 20 tried and true?

48:50.660 --> 48:54.660
20 tried and true reads a little patriotic

48:54.660 --> 48:55.660
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

48:55.660 --> 48:57.660
20 Dr. Drew, he sucks now

48:57.660 --> 49:00.660
Oh, okay, so that would be a good way to get to 20

49:00.660 --> 49:03.660
Yeah, we just, old stuff kicks ass though

49:03.660 --> 49:13.660
20, 20 you should sue, get justice

49:13.660 --> 49:17.660
20 more bamboo, it's sustainable

49:17.660 --> 49:21.660
20 kangaroo, put it in the pouch

49:21.660 --> 49:24.660
20 kangaroo, jump on it

49:24.660 --> 49:26.660
20 started-oo

49:26.660 --> 49:30.660
No, that's actually too motivational

49:30.660 --> 49:31.660
Yeah, yeah, yeah

49:31.660 --> 49:36.660
That would be on the front of a planner that I would purchase

49:36.660 --> 49:41.660
20 revenue, maximize your earning potential

49:41.660 --> 49:51.660
What about 20 racing crew, it's about family

49:51.660 --> 49:54.660
20 more fondue, make it cheesy

49:54.660 --> 50:01.660
Yeah, now I like that that implies that in previous years we've had some fondue, but this year it's 20 more fondue

50:01.660 --> 50:02.660
Turn it up

50:02.660 --> 50:04.660
20 Sudoku

50:04.660 --> 50:06.660
20 Sudoku

50:06.660 --> 50:08.660
20 Sudoku, line them up

50:08.660 --> 50:17.660
Can I tell you right now, I feel like we're never gonna find it, even if we find it we won't know it, and it's the worst episode we've ever made

50:17.660 --> 50:19.660
Yeah, this is our lowest again

50:19.660 --> 50:26.660
And this is, I feel the electricity right now because I believe you said that exact same thing last year right before we came up with 20 Big Dog Run

50:26.660 --> 50:29.660
Oh, oh, oh, okay

50:29.660 --> 50:36.660
20 Pay Per View, all of our episodes cost $1

50:36.660 --> 50:44.660
What if we did one just for us this year, it was like we've given you guys 11 good years

50:44.660 --> 50:50.660
This one's called 20 Pay Per View, and all our episodes cost $1 now, you have to put it into your phone

50:50.660 --> 50:53.660
What about 20 Miss Construe, say that again

50:53.660 --> 50:54.660
What was that?

50:54.660 --> 50:58.660
What was that?

50:58.660 --> 51:00.660
More for me and you

51:00.660 --> 51:03.660
No, 20 Miss Construe

51:03.660 --> 51:05.660
20 just for you

51:05.660 --> 51:07.660
20 just for you

51:07.660 --> 51:10.660
I feel like there's a lot of people in America that are already living that life

51:10.660 --> 51:11.660
Yeah, that's fair

51:11.660 --> 51:12.660
Yeah, yeah

51:12.660 --> 51:14.660
20 not for you

51:14.660 --> 51:16.660
20 New Tattoo

51:16.660 --> 51:21.660
Ooh, I, okay, okay, okay, let's, let's

51:21.660 --> 51:22.660
Let's take a breath

51:22.660 --> 51:24.660
Let's take a breath

51:24.660 --> 51:27.660
Now, 20 Big Dog Run, great

51:27.660 --> 51:36.660
Frankenstein Teen was the entire thing, is there something funny bamboo, funny big bamboo, funny

51:36.660 --> 51:46.660
20 monies through, time, crypto, time to become a crypto lord

51:46.660 --> 51:49.660
20 Santee View

51:49.660 --> 51:54.660
Oh yeah, now we're getting somewhere

51:54.660 --> 51:55.660
I got it

51:55.660 --> 51:56.660
Oh boy

51:56.660 --> 51:57.660
I got it

51:57.660 --> 51:59.660
Oh shit

51:59.660 --> 52:01.660
20 Rise of Groot

52:01.660 --> 52:06.660
Get back to where you once belonged, get back

52:06.660 --> 52:10.660
Coming this July

52:10.660 --> 52:14.660
Coming this July

52:14.660 --> 52:22.660
After many delays, we will finally be treated to it

52:22.660 --> 52:25.660
Despicable Me 4, The Rise of Groot

52:25.660 --> 52:27.660
It's Minions, The Rise of Groot

52:27.660 --> 52:28.660
Oh, okay

52:28.660 --> 52:29.660
Nice

52:29.660 --> 52:34.660
It used to be called Minions 2, and now it's called Minions Rise of Groot

52:34.660 --> 52:36.660
That's better

52:36.660 --> 52:44.660
20 Rise of Groot

52:44.660 --> 52:46.660
20 Baby Shoe

52:46.660 --> 52:47.660
For sale

52:47.660 --> 52:49.660
Never warned

52:49.660 --> 52:51.660
Why did you keep naming them?

52:51.660 --> 52:52.660
Oh, sorry

52:52.660 --> 52:57.660
It was, do you know that this movie was supposed to be released on July 3rd, 2020?

52:57.660 --> 52:59.660
That's why I think it's so powerful

52:59.660 --> 53:08.660
Because by calling the year 20 Rise of Groot, we're saying that this film will absolutely be released in theaters this July

53:08.660 --> 53:09.660
Yeah

53:09.660 --> 53:10.660
No bones about it

53:10.660 --> 53:17.660
What about 20 IOU, we will give the next year a much better name

53:17.660 --> 53:23.660
20 IOU, one good year name

53:23.660 --> 53:27.660
20 IOU, one hour of your life

53:27.660 --> 53:31.660
Let's do this, we'll go back through the list real quick

53:31.660 --> 53:36.660
I actually am warming back up to Carl Daniels Kick-Ass Year

53:36.660 --> 53:37.660
Yeah

53:37.660 --> 53:40.660
Okay, so just taking a look at the list, we got

53:40.660 --> 53:44.660
Carl Daniels Kick-Ass Year

53:44.660 --> 53:50.660
I'm gonna leave it in, I wish the name was funnier than Carl Daniels, but here we are

53:50.660 --> 53:54.660
20 Whoop-de-do, who cares, I still, I can't get on board with that

53:54.660 --> 53:56.660
20 Yummy Stew, something's cooking

53:56.660 --> 53:58.660
Or 20 Yummy Stew, put it in the pot

53:58.660 --> 53:59.660
Put it in the pot

53:59.660 --> 54:01.660
20 Cummies, ew

54:01.660 --> 54:03.660
20 Cummies 2

54:03.660 --> 54:05.660
20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20

54:05.660 --> 54:06.660
Yeah

54:06.660 --> 54:08.660
Tony, Tony, Tony, Tony

54:08.660 --> 54:11.660
20 Venti Brew, oh that Java

54:11.660 --> 54:13.660
20 Skies of Blue

54:13.660 --> 54:15.660
20 Coming Through, Emerge

54:15.660 --> 54:17.660
20 Runny Goo, what?

54:17.660 --> 54:19.660
20 Runny Goo

54:19.660 --> 54:22.660
20 Runny Goo, 20 Sun TV, Porch Life

54:22.660 --> 54:23.660
20 Mummy Crew

54:23.660 --> 54:26.660
20 Do The Do, brought to you by Mountain Dew Baja Blast

54:26.660 --> 54:28.660
And then Griffin kind of abandoned his posts

54:28.660 --> 54:31.660
Cause I feel like 20 Rendezvous, still merits consideration

54:31.660 --> 54:33.660
20 Rise of Gru

54:33.660 --> 54:35.660
20

54:35.660 --> 54:40.660
I feel in my heart, my heart's telling me

54:40.660 --> 54:41.660
This can't be fun to listen to

54:41.660 --> 54:43.660
That Mummy Crew is

54:43.660 --> 54:47.660
See, I'm still on, I'm still stuck on Yummy Stew

54:47.660 --> 54:48.660
I like the

54:48.660 --> 54:50.660
I'm telling you guys, 20 Mummy Stew

54:50.660 --> 54:52.660
20 Mummy Stew

54:52.660 --> 54:55.660
20 Mummy Stew, do what thou wilt

54:58.660 --> 55:00.660
Wait a minute, no this is powerful

55:00.660 --> 55:03.660
Is there a motto that we can do

55:03.660 --> 55:06.660
That is like, you guys have, you all have

55:06.660 --> 55:09.660
Flown, flown away from our nest

55:09.660 --> 55:10.660
Like you don't need us in

55:10.660 --> 55:13.660
Oh, 20 up to you, the power is yours

55:13.660 --> 55:15.660
20 up to you, 20

55:15.660 --> 55:18.660
Oh man, hold, oh you're so close

55:18.660 --> 55:21.660
20, 20 up to you

55:21.660 --> 55:24.660
20 it's in you, the magic's been in you all along

55:24.660 --> 55:28.660
The magic, 20 it's in you, the magic is

55:29.660 --> 55:31.660
The magic comma specifically

55:33.660 --> 55:36.660
20 up to you, what are your ideas

55:36.660 --> 55:38.660
20 up to you, fill in the blank

55:38.660 --> 55:43.660
No, see that's like, that's like you're no better off having heard it

55:43.660 --> 55:46.660
You know, like you're exactly where you started

55:46.660 --> 55:48.660
That's like coming to the oracle and the oracle's like

55:48.660 --> 55:50.660
I don't fucking, I don't play Madden, get out of here

55:50.660 --> 55:52.660
What do you think is gonna happen

55:52.660 --> 55:54.660
What do you think, I don't know

55:54.660 --> 55:55.660
Can't see the future, what am I

55:55.660 --> 55:58.660
20 Mummy Stew, people used to eat mummies

55:59.660 --> 56:03.660
Is there something, is there something instead of stew

56:03.660 --> 56:05.660
Can we swap brew in there

56:05.660 --> 56:07.660
And is there a word that's like

56:07.660 --> 56:09.660
I'm imagining a bubbling pot

56:09.660 --> 56:13.660
And people putting their stuff in the pot

56:13.660 --> 56:16.660
And not being afraid to put stuff in the pot, like they're gonna ruin it

56:16.660 --> 56:21.660
And then you get out of that, you get like a soup or a potion

56:21.660 --> 56:23.660
I don't even know what you're asking

56:23.660 --> 56:24.660
Like a witches brew

56:24.660 --> 56:25.660
What are you suggesting

56:25.660 --> 56:27.660
Is there another word

56:27.660 --> 56:28.660
Is there another

56:28.660 --> 56:31.660
Yummy mummy stew, yummy mummy brew

56:31.660 --> 56:33.660
Yummy mummy stew

56:33.660 --> 56:34.660
Yummy mummy

56:34.660 --> 56:37.660
Yummy mummy brew

56:40.660 --> 56:41.660
From Budweiser

56:41.660 --> 56:43.660
Yummy mummy is a trademark

56:43.660 --> 56:46.660
So we can't, that's owned by the General Mills Corporation

56:46.660 --> 56:49.660
Dammit, cause that was gonna be it too, shit

56:56.660 --> 56:57.660
Yes

56:57.660 --> 56:58.660
Yes Griffin

57:00.660 --> 57:01.660
20 new shampoo

57:01.660 --> 57:04.660
20 new shampoo, gotta try something

57:04.660 --> 57:06.660
How about this, 20 new shampoo, gotta try something

57:06.660 --> 57:07.660
Something's gotta change

57:07.660 --> 57:09.660
The stakes, the stakes

57:09.660 --> 57:11.660
20 new shampoo, something's gotta give

57:11.660 --> 57:12.660
The stakes are low

57:12.660 --> 57:14.660
20 tummy goo

57:14.660 --> 57:18.660
What's that on your, what do you got on your tummy

57:18.660 --> 57:20.660
The upset tummy crew

57:21.660 --> 57:24.660
20 old U2, you just listened to Joshua Tree

57:24.660 --> 57:25.660
That's good

57:27.660 --> 57:28.660
20 no taboo

57:28.660 --> 57:30.660
Oh Jesus Christ no

57:30.660 --> 57:31.660
That could be problematic

57:31.660 --> 57:33.660
20 no taboo

57:33.660 --> 57:35.660
20 in review

57:35.660 --> 57:37.660
It's the 20 that sucks isn't it

57:37.660 --> 57:39.660
This decade's gonna suck to me

57:39.660 --> 57:41.660
This millennium is gonna suck

57:41.660 --> 57:44.660
This millennium, I'm gonna say 20, I want 30

57:44.660 --> 57:46.660
Can you imagine if we were in the 30s

57:46.660 --> 57:47.660
We could do like

57:47.660 --> 57:48.660
Oh you could do like dirty

57:48.660 --> 57:49.660
Dirty everything

57:49.660 --> 57:50.660
Flirty

57:50.660 --> 57:53.660
We gotta make it to at least the, we got dirty, flirty

57:53.660 --> 57:54.660
Shirty

57:54.660 --> 57:55.660
Squirty

57:55.660 --> 57:56.660
Squirty

57:56.660 --> 57:57.660
Squirty tummy goo

57:57.660 --> 57:58.660
I would give you that

57:58.660 --> 57:59.660
Are we skipping

57:59.660 --> 58:01.660
Squirty tummy goo

58:02.660 --> 58:04.660
2023, off the rails

58:08.660 --> 58:10.660
2023, take a pass

58:10.660 --> 58:12.660
2023, looking forward

58:12.660 --> 58:17.660
Can we go back to 20, 20, 20, 22, 22 deuces wild

58:18.660 --> 58:21.660
What if we just called this year the deuce

58:21.660 --> 58:23.660
Oh the double deuce

58:23.660 --> 58:25.660
2022, ballet time

58:25.660 --> 58:28.660
Let's see, let's get abstract

58:28.660 --> 58:30.660
We have been recording for so long

58:30.660 --> 58:31.660
Yeah

58:31.660 --> 58:32.660
Okay

58:32.660 --> 58:35.660
M-M-X-X-I-I

58:35.660 --> 58:36.660
Mix it up

58:38.660 --> 58:39.660
Is there

58:40.660 --> 58:41.660
20 bigly chew

58:41.660 --> 58:43.660
I feel like that's where we were

58:43.660 --> 58:44.660
Wait

58:45.660 --> 58:46.660
20

58:46.660 --> 58:48.660
Bigly chew

58:48.660 --> 58:51.660
20 breaking through

58:51.660 --> 58:52.660
Emerge

58:53.660 --> 58:56.660
But that doesn't feel, I can't get excited about that

58:56.660 --> 59:00.660
Not as much as 20 kangaroo put it in the pouch

59:04.660 --> 59:06.660
And we could do a mascot with that one

59:06.660 --> 59:09.660
We could have like a mascot that's a kangaroo

59:09.660 --> 59:12.660
We could call him Jack, but not that kangaroo Jack

59:12.660 --> 59:14.660
No, a different one

59:14.660 --> 59:16.660
20 talking to, sit down

59:16.660 --> 59:17.660
You're fucked up

59:20.660 --> 59:21.660
Sit down

59:22.660 --> 59:23.660
We need to have a talk

59:23.660 --> 59:25.660
Look he's talking to

59:25.660 --> 59:26.660
Meme

59:30.660 --> 59:33.660
Okay, we could just do this forever

59:33.660 --> 59:34.660
You know what I'm saying?

59:34.660 --> 59:36.660
Like we were very close with 20

59:36.660 --> 59:39.660
I feel like 20 rendezvous, a night to remember

59:39.660 --> 59:42.660
Is the most powerful one that I have experienced

59:42.660 --> 59:44.660
That is the one that got the biggest reaction from me

59:44.660 --> 59:46.660
That one gave me the chill bumps

59:46.660 --> 59:48.660
What's it mean though?

59:48.660 --> 59:50.660
I told you Griffin

59:50.660 --> 59:52.660
No, you didn't

59:52.660 --> 59:54.660
It's a night to remember

59:54.660 --> 59:55.660
Make the most of it

59:55.660 --> 59:57.660
What's it mean though?

59:57.660 --> 59:59.660
It means that when a slow dance comes on

59:59.660 --> 01:00:01.660
Get close

01:00:03.660 --> 01:00:06.660
20 rendezvous certainly hits the lips good

01:00:06.660 --> 01:00:10.660
A night to remember isn't any, it doesn't mean anything

01:00:10.660 --> 01:00:15.660
Can we take 20 rendezvous and make it more like secret spy kind of feeling

01:00:15.660 --> 01:00:19.660
But it's like if we do shows this year

01:00:19.660 --> 01:00:23.660
Then 20 rendezvous and night to remember will be very powerful

01:00:23.660 --> 01:00:25.660
Well that is a good point

01:00:25.660 --> 01:00:29.660
But what about 20 rendezvous trading secrets?

01:00:29.660 --> 01:00:31.660
What? No

01:00:31.660 --> 01:00:32.660
No

01:00:32.660 --> 01:00:36.660
20 rendezvous, there's been a murder

01:00:36.660 --> 01:00:38.660
20 mummy crew, wrap it up

01:00:38.660 --> 01:00:40.660
Now I already said that and make it about safe sex

01:00:40.660 --> 01:00:42.660
And we just kind of get right past that

01:00:42.660 --> 01:00:43.660
Yeah, just kind of

01:00:43.660 --> 01:00:46.660
20 rendezvous

01:00:46.660 --> 01:00:48.660
Get organized

01:00:48.660 --> 01:00:50.660
Organize

01:00:50.660 --> 01:00:52.660
Do it

01:00:52.660 --> 01:00:53.660
Seize the means

01:00:53.660 --> 01:00:55.660
20 rendezvous, stronger together

01:00:55.660 --> 01:00:57.660
Seize the means of production

01:00:57.660 --> 01:01:01.660
20 rendezvous, seize the means of production

01:01:01.660 --> 01:01:03.660
Why would those two ideas have anything to do with each other?

01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:05.660
Well you're rendezvousing

01:01:05.660 --> 01:01:09.660
It's like this is the year where everybody unionizes

01:01:09.660 --> 01:01:10.660
20 rendezvous

01:01:10.660 --> 01:01:13.660
20 rendezvous, strengthen numbers

01:01:13.660 --> 01:01:18.660
20 mummy crew, strengthen numbers

01:01:18.660 --> 01:01:21.660
God, now I'm back to liking mummy crew

01:01:21.660 --> 01:01:23.660
I know, 20 mummy crew

01:01:23.660 --> 01:01:25.660
The ties that bind

01:01:25.660 --> 01:01:27.660
20 mummy crew

01:01:27.660 --> 01:01:30.660
The ties that bind is not like

01:01:30.660 --> 01:01:34.660
Not everybody, I want it to be something everybody can do

01:01:34.660 --> 01:01:36.660
Sometimes you make it too hard

01:01:36.660 --> 01:01:40.660
It requires collaboration, that was our mistake in 2018

01:01:40.660 --> 01:01:44.660
20 mummy crew, weigh your heart

01:01:44.660 --> 01:01:48.660
20 busting through, oh yeah

01:01:48.660 --> 01:01:50.660
Oh that's cool

01:01:50.660 --> 01:01:51.660
Oh yeah

01:01:51.660 --> 01:01:52.660
Aid

01:01:52.660 --> 01:01:53.660
Cool aid

01:01:53.660 --> 01:01:54.660
20 busting through

01:01:54.660 --> 01:01:56.660
Oh yeah

01:01:56.660 --> 01:01:58.660
Now that feels dangerously close to

01:01:58.660 --> 01:02:01.660
We're hoping to be reimbursed

01:02:01.660 --> 01:02:04.660
20 we've been sued

01:02:04.660 --> 01:02:07.660
By the Kool-Aid Corporation

01:02:07.660 --> 01:02:09.660
Okay, right now for me

01:02:09.660 --> 01:02:13.660
It is between 20 rendezvous colon something

01:02:13.660 --> 01:02:16.660
And 20 mummy crew colon something

01:02:16.660 --> 01:02:17.660
20 what's this do?

01:02:17.660 --> 01:02:18.660
Mysterious buttons

01:02:18.660 --> 01:02:21.660
Now I just listed two options Justin

01:02:21.660 --> 01:02:23.660
And what you did

01:02:23.660 --> 01:02:24.660
Say yours again

01:02:24.660 --> 01:02:27.660
20 rendezvous something

01:02:27.660 --> 01:02:29.660
And 20 mummy crew something

01:02:29.660 --> 01:02:31.660
Something

01:02:31.660 --> 01:02:34.660
To me if we can find

01:02:34.660 --> 01:02:37.660
It's like the last Tumblr to click in place

01:02:37.660 --> 01:02:40.660
Is the thing that goes after them

01:02:40.660 --> 01:02:42.660
Not the year name

01:02:42.660 --> 01:02:43.660
Right

01:02:43.660 --> 01:02:44.660
20 mummy

01:02:44.660 --> 01:02:47.660
Is 20 mummy crew too close to Frankenstein team?

01:02:47.660 --> 01:02:49.660
I'm actually fine with that

01:02:49.660 --> 01:02:50.660
This is part of

01:02:50.660 --> 01:02:52.660
In the iconography this does worry me

01:02:52.660 --> 01:02:53.660
Because we did a lot of monster imagery

01:02:53.660 --> 01:02:55.660
We did do a ton of monster imagery

01:02:55.660 --> 01:02:56.660
But they didn't say

01:02:56.660 --> 01:02:58.660
They weren't like oh we've already got Boo Berry

01:02:58.660 --> 01:03:00.660
Can we do Count Chocula?

01:03:00.660 --> 01:03:02.660
I'm actually liking 20 rendezvous more

01:03:02.660 --> 01:03:03.660
Because it's like

01:03:03.660 --> 01:03:05.660
It's got like sort of a sexy adult energy

01:03:05.660 --> 01:03:06.660
Yes

01:03:06.660 --> 01:03:08.660
We've never really done that before

01:03:08.660 --> 01:03:12.660
Fuck it would be funny to just have a prom theme

01:03:12.660 --> 01:03:13.660
Thank you

01:03:13.660 --> 01:03:15.660
And not have it be aspirational at all

01:03:15.660 --> 01:03:18.660
But just have it be like the vibe of the year

01:03:18.660 --> 01:03:19.660
Can we do that?

01:03:19.660 --> 01:03:21.660
Can we define the vibe of the year

01:03:21.660 --> 01:03:23.660
And not necessarily the objective?

01:03:23.660 --> 01:03:25.660
Sort of like you're saying like a tonal

01:03:25.660 --> 01:03:28.660
A tonal motto and not

01:03:28.660 --> 01:03:31.660
20 rendezvous a night in paradise

01:03:31.660 --> 01:03:32.660
Because here's the thing

01:03:32.660 --> 01:03:33.660
When we tell people what to do

01:03:33.660 --> 01:03:37.660
One doesn't do anything materially to improve their lives

01:03:37.660 --> 01:03:39.660
Or two they don't fucking do it

01:03:39.660 --> 01:03:40.660
Yeah

01:03:40.660 --> 01:03:42.660
How many monsters do you think came out of 2019?

01:03:42.660 --> 01:03:43.660
Not a lot I would say

01:03:43.660 --> 01:03:46.660
But if we say 20 rendezvous a night to remember

01:03:46.660 --> 01:03:48.660
And then somebody

01:03:48.660 --> 01:03:52.660
It just has that energy in the ecosystem

01:03:52.660 --> 01:03:54.660
That could do something

01:03:54.660 --> 01:03:57.660
I think 20 rendezvous is it

01:03:57.660 --> 01:03:59.660
I think let's jazz it right now

01:03:59.660 --> 01:04:01.660
To find the right tagline

01:04:01.660 --> 01:04:04.660
Because I just don't think a night to remember is it

01:04:04.660 --> 01:04:05.660
Okay

01:04:05.660 --> 01:04:07.660
Okay listen
