00:00.000 --> 00:06.040
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:06.040 --> 00:11.440
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.440 --> 00:16.840
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how

00:16.840 --> 00:21.120
cool they are for listening.

00:21.120 --> 00:30.720
What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:51.640
Oh, hello.

00:51.640 --> 00:52.640
Did you start the thing?

00:52.640 --> 00:54.520
Yeah, no, I started the thing.

00:54.520 --> 00:55.800
The thing is going.

00:55.800 --> 00:56.800
This is it.

00:56.800 --> 00:57.800
We're in it now.

00:57.800 --> 00:58.800
We're in the shit.

00:58.800 --> 01:00.320
We're in the part that the people paid the money for.

01:00.320 --> 01:04.520
Chilean miners emerging from the ground.

01:04.520 --> 01:12.440
We are here with you, the podcast viewing public, to sell our wares.

01:12.440 --> 01:13.440
What's on offer today?

01:13.440 --> 01:14.440
Podcast.

01:14.440 --> 01:15.440
Podcast.

01:15.440 --> 01:17.120
Podcast for sale.

01:17.120 --> 01:18.120
And honey.

01:18.120 --> 01:19.120
I made honey.

01:19.120 --> 01:20.120
I figured it out.

01:20.120 --> 01:21.120
He made it himself.

01:21.120 --> 01:24.680
Welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me, and Advice Show for the modern era.

01:24.680 --> 01:30.440
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

01:30.440 --> 01:31.440
I tickled you, huh?

01:31.440 --> 01:34.400
Because it's the name of the shit and then it was your name.

01:34.400 --> 01:41.080
I'm your middle brother, Travis McElroy.

01:41.080 --> 01:43.240
And I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

01:43.240 --> 01:44.800
All right.

01:44.800 --> 01:46.360
That's fine.

01:46.360 --> 01:47.360
All right.

01:47.360 --> 01:48.360
That's fine.

01:48.360 --> 01:49.360
We get it.

01:49.360 --> 01:53.240
Thank you all for joining us here live at the PlayStation Theater.

01:53.240 --> 01:55.600
That's the name of the place.

01:55.600 --> 01:56.600
It's the name of the theater.

01:56.600 --> 01:57.600
It's the PlayStation Theater.

01:57.600 --> 02:00.080
That's not a clever bit we came up with.

02:00.080 --> 02:01.080
We do have some stuff.

02:01.080 --> 02:02.080
We're super excited to be here.

02:02.080 --> 02:07.840
It's a nice place, centrally located right across from Guy Fieri's shit store.

02:07.840 --> 02:08.840
His whole thing?

02:08.840 --> 02:09.840
His whole...

02:09.840 --> 02:12.760
As Fieri watches overall.

02:12.760 --> 02:16.400
His chubby museum.

02:16.400 --> 02:17.400
But it is the PlayStation Theater.

02:17.400 --> 02:20.400
I thought it was a museum of the swang.

02:20.400 --> 02:21.400
No.

02:21.400 --> 02:22.400
It is the PlayStation Theater.

02:22.400 --> 02:23.400
All right.

02:23.400 --> 02:24.400
We got some stuff out of the way.

02:24.400 --> 02:25.400
And just the first thing is...

02:25.400 --> 02:26.400
Yo, fuck Xbox.

02:26.400 --> 02:27.400
Right?

02:27.400 --> 02:28.400
Yeah.

02:28.400 --> 02:34.280
The whole fucking family, man.

02:34.280 --> 02:36.120
The first Xbox, Xbox One.

02:36.120 --> 02:39.600
You can't call it Xbox One again.

02:39.600 --> 02:40.600
Xbox 360.

02:40.600 --> 02:44.040
Sounds like you skipped 359 of them, idiot.

02:44.040 --> 02:45.040
Boom.

02:45.040 --> 02:46.040
Boom.

02:46.040 --> 02:47.040
Cameo.

02:47.040 --> 02:48.040
Suck my dick.

02:48.040 --> 02:49.040
Blink's a time sweeper.

02:49.040 --> 02:50.040
Suck my dick.

02:50.040 --> 02:51.040
Fuck off, Blink's a time sweeper.

02:51.040 --> 02:52.040
You got nothing.

02:52.040 --> 02:53.040
Suck my dick.

02:53.040 --> 02:54.040
Suck my dick.

02:54.040 --> 02:55.040
Suck my dick.

02:55.040 --> 02:56.040
I don't know any platform exclusive games.

02:56.040 --> 02:57.040
But yeah, fuck them.

02:57.040 --> 02:58.040
Halo.

02:58.040 --> 02:59.040
Halo.

02:59.040 --> 03:00.040
Reach around my butt and grab my balls.

03:00.040 --> 03:01.040
Yeah.

03:01.040 --> 03:02.040
Fuck Xbox.

03:02.040 --> 03:03.040
Fuck Xbox.

03:03.040 --> 03:04.040
Uh-oh.

03:04.040 --> 03:05.040
Who's that?

03:05.040 --> 03:06.040
Over the horizon.

03:06.040 --> 03:07.040
It's Nintendo.

03:07.040 --> 03:08.040
Fuck you guys, too.

03:08.040 --> 03:09.040
Yeah.

03:09.040 --> 03:10.040
Luigi can suck my balls.

03:10.040 --> 03:11.040
Okay.

03:11.040 --> 03:12.040
That's good.

03:12.040 --> 03:13.040
You know what Nintendo thinks.

03:13.040 --> 03:14.040
Now, I will say this.

03:14.040 --> 03:15.040
Thank you.

03:15.040 --> 03:16.040
I will say this, though.

03:16.040 --> 03:17.040
Yeah.

03:17.040 --> 03:18.040
Backstage.

03:18.040 --> 03:22.960
I got smoked out by Crash Bandicoot.

03:22.960 --> 03:23.960
That dude fucking rules.

03:23.960 --> 03:24.960
He's so cool and chill.

03:24.960 --> 03:25.960
He's so fucking cool and chill.

03:25.960 --> 03:26.960
And who lit the spliff?

03:26.960 --> 03:27.960
Spyro the dragon.

03:27.960 --> 03:28.960
Spyro the dragon did it.

03:28.960 --> 03:29.960
Of course he did.

03:29.960 --> 03:30.960
The reason I broke up...

03:30.960 --> 03:31.960
Did I say lit the spliff?

03:31.960 --> 03:32.960
How old am I?

03:32.960 --> 03:42.120
The reason I broke up when I was introduced to myself is I was thinking about how just

03:42.120 --> 03:49.280
a second ago Griffin told us, as he has told us before every live show we've ever done

03:49.280 --> 03:50.280
in our lives...

03:50.280 --> 03:51.280
Okay.

03:51.280 --> 03:52.280
This is gonna make me sound terrible.

03:52.280 --> 03:53.280
This is...

03:53.280 --> 03:55.320
I told you that in confidence, obviously.

03:55.320 --> 03:56.320
Okay.

03:56.320 --> 03:59.400
What he said was, aw, they horny for this one.

03:59.400 --> 04:00.400
Now, there is...

04:00.400 --> 04:01.400
Listen.

04:01.400 --> 04:02.400
Listen.

04:02.400 --> 04:03.400
Now, listen, though.

04:03.400 --> 04:04.400
No, listen, though, for real.

04:04.400 --> 04:05.400
Listen.

04:05.400 --> 04:06.400
Listen.

04:06.400 --> 04:07.400
Listen.

04:07.400 --> 04:08.400
Listen.

04:08.400 --> 04:09.400
Listen.

04:09.400 --> 04:10.400
Listen.

04:10.400 --> 04:11.400
Listen.

04:11.400 --> 04:12.400
Listen.

04:12.400 --> 04:13.400
Listen.

04:13.400 --> 04:14.400
Listen.

04:14.400 --> 04:15.400
Listen.

04:15.400 --> 04:16.400
Listen.

04:16.400 --> 04:17.400
It's mind over matter.

04:17.400 --> 04:18.400
I'm extremely nervous.

04:18.400 --> 04:19.400
I get so scared back there.

04:19.400 --> 04:20.400
Well, that's the old saying.

04:20.400 --> 04:25.040
If you're nervous, just picture everyone in the crowd horny.

04:25.040 --> 04:26.040
Just for this...

04:26.040 --> 04:27.880
Just for this one.

04:27.880 --> 04:28.880
Just for this one?

04:28.880 --> 04:29.880
Just for this one.

04:29.880 --> 04:30.880
Just for this one.

04:30.880 --> 04:34.760
I believe you also use the term wet and wild.

04:34.760 --> 04:37.280
That's just in reference to this dance that we're gonna be doing up here.

04:37.280 --> 04:38.280
Okay.

04:38.280 --> 04:41.680
That's a lot of fun falls we've been practicing.

04:41.680 --> 04:47.160
I want to say you all are very, very special tonight.

04:47.160 --> 04:53.240
Not just because you're here, but because you will also be the first human beings to

04:53.240 --> 05:00.840
hear us say out loud that we are doing a television show in the near future.

05:00.840 --> 05:03.520
Yeah.

05:03.520 --> 05:14.320
So here's the thing.

05:14.320 --> 05:15.320
That's good.

05:15.320 --> 05:16.320
The house lights are good.

05:16.320 --> 05:18.520
You can bring the stage lights even down a little bit, help me out with the glare.

05:18.520 --> 05:19.520
Here's the thing.

05:19.520 --> 05:21.320
It's coming next year.

05:21.320 --> 05:23.640
And here's the other thing we're...

05:23.640 --> 05:25.040
This is true.

05:25.040 --> 05:29.960
We're filming it in Huntington, West Virginia.

05:29.960 --> 05:34.720
So I guess my question, and I can't see you guys right now, but I'm trusting you're still

05:34.720 --> 05:35.720
there.

05:35.720 --> 05:36.720
My question is this.

05:36.720 --> 05:40.880
Are you all horny for this one?

05:40.880 --> 05:47.560
So that is gonna be available on CISO TV, who we are of course big fans of.

05:47.560 --> 05:48.800
Thank you so much.

05:48.800 --> 05:50.800
Don't wait to subscribe to CISO.

05:50.800 --> 05:51.800
Do it right now.

05:51.800 --> 05:53.700
They got so much better stuff.

05:53.700 --> 05:57.320
You could right now leave the theater and I think go watch Hidden America, which is

05:57.320 --> 06:00.040
probably gonna be better than whatever we put on up here.

06:00.040 --> 06:03.640
They're also the first company that we went to and they didn't immediately see what we

06:03.640 --> 06:07.480
look like and we're like, no.

06:07.480 --> 06:08.480
Absolutely not.

06:08.480 --> 06:09.480
No.

06:09.480 --> 06:12.200
You can't.

06:12.200 --> 06:13.200
Not on TV.

06:13.200 --> 06:14.200
No.

06:14.200 --> 06:15.200
Wait.

06:15.200 --> 06:17.000
With your face and everything?

06:17.000 --> 06:18.960
You realize this is the bigger screen, right?

06:18.960 --> 06:22.360
Not the computer one or the iPad one, the one that people hold.

06:22.360 --> 06:27.440
And we looked into that truth about cats and dogs technology that they did in the movie

06:27.440 --> 06:29.240
where I haven't seen it.

06:29.240 --> 06:32.400
I'm gonna let you fucking hang.

06:32.400 --> 06:36.080
If you think I'm gonna fucking Tarzan to your rescue with cats and dogs.

06:36.080 --> 06:37.080
Here it goes.

06:37.080 --> 06:38.080
Here it goes.

06:38.080 --> 06:39.080
Here it goes.

06:39.080 --> 06:40.080
Here it goes.

06:40.080 --> 06:41.080
Oh, here we go.

06:41.080 --> 06:44.040
Janine Garofalo turned Uma Thurman into a human puppet.

06:44.040 --> 06:45.040
I think.

06:45.040 --> 06:49.920
Nailed it.

06:49.920 --> 06:54.000
I'm a dude who loves to walk around the apartment in my underwear.

06:54.000 --> 06:58.040
I step in the door and boom, my clothes are off.

06:58.040 --> 07:03.440
Now my roommates don't mind this, but one of them is Airbnb-ing his room while he summers

07:03.440 --> 07:04.440
in Chicago.

07:04.440 --> 07:05.440
Ruh-roh.

07:05.440 --> 07:08.440
While he summers in Chicago.

07:08.440 --> 07:11.520
While he summers in Chicago.

07:11.520 --> 07:15.760
He has rented the room to a nice couple and has asked that in his three month absence,

07:15.760 --> 07:18.840
I reframe some semi-nudity so he doesn't get a bad review.

07:18.840 --> 07:21.840
I hate the idea of giving up on my freedom.

07:21.840 --> 07:23.340
It's not my problem.

07:23.340 --> 07:25.460
Or is it?

07:25.460 --> 07:30.540
Am I the asshole here for wanting to continue a clothes-free lifestyle that's from nudists

07:30.540 --> 07:32.560
in New York?

07:32.560 --> 07:33.560
You're in boxers.

07:33.560 --> 07:34.560
Are you here?

07:34.560 --> 07:35.560
Yeah!

07:35.560 --> 07:43.000
Are Ozzy Osbourne, is that you?

07:43.000 --> 07:48.800
I was fucking running a list of things I hope you don't sound like in my head.

07:48.800 --> 07:51.800
Welcome to the apartment!

07:51.800 --> 07:57.120
Check out my dick!

07:57.120 --> 08:03.720
Dear Airbnb review, this was a cool house, centrally located.

08:03.720 --> 08:04.720
Great neighborhood.

08:04.720 --> 08:07.480
Great neighborhood, very affordable.

08:07.480 --> 08:11.600
The other thing about it is I can draw Chris' penis from memory.

08:11.600 --> 08:17.040
Are you curious about every nook and cranny of Chris' penis?

08:17.040 --> 08:18.040
Do you have an hour?

08:18.040 --> 08:19.040
Okay.

08:19.040 --> 08:20.040
Sit down.

08:20.040 --> 08:22.440
He's got a lot of them.

08:22.440 --> 08:25.440
Act one, the shaft.

08:25.440 --> 08:30.520
Five star, ten out of ten.

08:30.520 --> 08:31.520
Would recommend.

08:31.520 --> 08:32.520
It was great.

08:32.520 --> 08:33.520
No, it was great.

08:33.520 --> 08:34.520
It was great.

08:34.520 --> 08:35.520
The penis?

08:35.520 --> 08:36.520
Great.

08:36.520 --> 08:37.520
Good stuff.

08:37.520 --> 08:38.520
Great.

08:38.520 --> 08:42.320
How is this not a criminal crime for criminals?

08:42.320 --> 08:46.840
I can't like bounce on my wife who I live with and be like, someone else is gonna be

08:46.840 --> 08:47.840
here for a while.

08:47.840 --> 08:49.840
I'm going to eat all the fruit by the foot later.

08:49.840 --> 08:50.840
No, it's cool.

08:50.840 --> 08:52.720
I'm going to get like 150 bucks.

08:52.720 --> 08:53.720
It's totally cool.

08:53.720 --> 08:57.280
Do you have to put that in like the Airbnb description?

08:57.280 --> 08:58.280
There might be a God in you.

08:58.280 --> 09:03.760
Do you think there's like coded language of like, open air plan, you know what I mean?

09:03.760 --> 09:04.760
Derrick.

09:04.760 --> 09:05.760
Open Derrick.

09:05.760 --> 09:06.760
Open Derrick.

09:06.760 --> 09:12.320
Public Derrick for use by all.

09:12.320 --> 09:16.800
Why not?

09:16.800 --> 09:17.800
I don't know.

09:17.800 --> 09:20.280
Wait, I was about to make a joke about the guy's penis.

09:20.280 --> 09:21.800
What is the name we settled on?

09:21.800 --> 09:22.800
Chris Derrick?

09:22.800 --> 09:23.800
Chris Derrick?

09:23.800 --> 09:24.800
Chris Derrick?

09:24.800 --> 09:25.800
Chris Derrick?

09:25.800 --> 09:28.800
Hey, Chris Derrick, let me see you erotica.

09:28.800 --> 09:31.160
Now I lost the joke, but I do remember his name is Chris Derrick.

09:31.160 --> 09:34.560
And something about his penis.

09:34.560 --> 09:36.960
That's just comedy math right there.

09:36.960 --> 09:40.200
Name plus penis reference equals audience disappointment.

09:40.200 --> 09:42.600
Six years of podcasting, apparently.

09:42.600 --> 09:50.280
Hey, do you guys want a Yahoo answer from Yahoo Answers?

09:50.280 --> 10:00.840
Can you take a moment, though, and game recognize game Rachel Rosie for me real quick?

10:00.840 --> 10:01.840
Thank you, Rachel.

10:01.840 --> 10:02.840
It's about Yahoo Answers.

10:02.840 --> 10:11.360
User Brian, who asks, can cops pull over other cops?

10:11.360 --> 10:14.720
Let's say a cop was breaking the law, driving down the street for something like speeding

10:14.720 --> 10:16.160
or not using a turn signal.

10:16.160 --> 10:18.520
Can another cop get behind him and pull him over?

10:18.520 --> 10:19.520
Got you.

10:19.520 --> 10:20.520
Arrest you.

10:20.520 --> 10:21.520
Good.

10:21.520 --> 10:22.520
This time, Derrick again.

10:22.520 --> 10:23.520
Derrick's been spelled differently.

10:23.520 --> 10:28.520
You saw on Twitter over there on your phone?

10:28.520 --> 10:29.520
What?

10:29.520 --> 10:30.720
I thought we were supposed to tweet.

10:30.720 --> 10:34.920
I wanted to tweet about the show happened, and I thought you guys could handle it.

10:34.920 --> 10:35.920
Cool.

10:35.920 --> 10:39.600
Already big time Mr. Hollywood phoning it in.

10:39.600 --> 10:41.240
TVs were the real money.

10:41.240 --> 10:45.560
You know, the first time we talked about this question, I thought of like plain clothes,

10:45.560 --> 10:48.640
like a dude in a car who was like, I'm actually a cop.

10:48.640 --> 10:53.280
But now I'm picturing like someone pulling over another cop car with a uniform on top.

10:53.280 --> 10:54.280
But then what if-

10:54.280 --> 10:55.280
Do you know why I pulled you over?

10:55.280 --> 10:57.440
Yes, fuck, I know why you pulled me over.

10:57.440 --> 11:01.640
What if to catch that cop car, the second cop car had to speed, and we got a whole human

11:01.640 --> 11:04.820
centipede situation?

11:04.820 --> 11:08.560
They sewed the cars together?

11:08.560 --> 11:10.680
That seems cruel and unusual.

11:10.680 --> 11:13.880
That is what happened in that movie.

11:13.880 --> 11:14.880
Which one?

11:14.880 --> 11:15.880
The human centipede.

11:15.880 --> 11:16.880
Oh, I'm with you now.

11:16.880 --> 11:20.440
Someone's got to stop him from doing like, I mean-

11:20.440 --> 11:21.960
Who watches the Watchmen?

11:21.960 --> 11:22.960
Yeah, exactly.

11:22.960 --> 11:23.960
Exactly.

11:23.960 --> 11:29.200
That's a good- Why has nobody ever thought of seeing if cops are on the love learn?

11:29.200 --> 11:31.600
There should be a cop for cops.

11:31.600 --> 11:32.600
Cop cop.

11:32.600 --> 11:37.560
Do you think- Cop cop, time to go to jail or work.

11:37.560 --> 11:39.720
Time to come to work with me.

11:39.720 --> 11:41.000
Time to come to work with me.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
You're in jail now.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.560
Cop cop, making arrests, but no friends.

11:45.560 --> 11:47.280
You just said top cop, I think?

11:47.280 --> 11:48.280
Top cop.

11:48.280 --> 11:51.280
You got to make it to the top to arrest other cops.

11:51.280 --> 11:52.680
Yeah, you got to be the king of cops.

11:52.680 --> 11:54.720
You can't arrest from the bottom up.

11:54.720 --> 11:57.280
You can't be first day on the job arresting the chief.

11:57.280 --> 11:58.440
First off, okay, two things.

11:58.440 --> 12:01.720
First off, coming this summer to TLC, top cop.

12:01.720 --> 12:03.880
America's next top cop.

12:03.880 --> 12:08.400
America's next top cop, and secondly, do you think they would have to get the best cop

12:08.400 --> 12:10.040
to catch the other cops, right?

12:10.040 --> 12:12.520
How do you want to think a cop with the best cop?

12:12.520 --> 12:13.520
Not the worst cop.

12:13.520 --> 12:14.520
It was like, I don't know.

12:14.520 --> 12:16.160
What do you even do?

12:16.160 --> 12:26.680
Is President Barack Hussein Obama, and a lot of people forget about the Hussein, it's important.

12:26.680 --> 12:30.720
I've never done that one live, and it was like, I didn't know how it was going to go.

12:30.720 --> 12:31.720
It's okay.

12:31.720 --> 12:32.720
You only said half the syllables.

12:32.720 --> 12:36.120
Yeah, you kind of farted the last- Does President Barack Hussein, and a lot of

12:36.120 --> 12:43.960
people forget about the Hussein, but it's important, Obama, is he the top cop?

12:43.960 --> 12:46.960
Because the buck stops here, is that what that means?

12:46.960 --> 12:50.640
The crime stops here, and I'm it, like if Joe Biden's speed, and he's like, I got you

12:50.640 --> 12:52.000
and I'm the only one, dog.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
Bad luck.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.320
I was like right behind you in traffic.

12:54.320 --> 12:56.520
I saw you turn left without the signal.

12:56.520 --> 12:58.040
Joe, that's a bad beat, dude.

12:58.040 --> 12:59.840
I'm literally the only dude.

12:59.840 --> 13:00.840
It's me.

13:00.840 --> 13:02.520
Why'd you do it in front of me?

13:02.520 --> 13:03.520
I'm top cop.

13:03.520 --> 13:04.520
You know this.

13:04.520 --> 13:07.840
It's all checks and balances, because he can arrest Joe Biden, but who can arrest Barack

13:07.840 --> 13:08.840
Obama?

13:08.840 --> 13:13.400
The lowliest, the criminals.

13:13.400 --> 13:17.960
Only criminals can arrest the president for speeding.

13:17.960 --> 13:22.760
I love the world where the president's A, driving himself, and B, just like burning

13:22.760 --> 13:23.760
it.

13:23.760 --> 13:28.720
Just like pedal to the metal, see you bitches in Arlington, bye.

13:28.720 --> 13:32.640
Him and Joe Biden have a famous series of pranks that they do back and forth on each

13:32.640 --> 13:33.640
other.

13:33.640 --> 13:37.000
And this is the end game.

13:37.000 --> 13:42.360
Do you think that cops, I was thinking about when we were saying come with me to jail,

13:42.360 --> 13:43.360
I mean work.

13:43.360 --> 13:50.480
Do you think cops, if the money's ever tight, just like decide to live in jail?

13:50.480 --> 13:51.720
Cut down on the commute.

13:51.720 --> 13:53.040
Just like there's no commute.

13:53.040 --> 13:56.960
It's like, do you think it ever occurs to them like, well, I could just go home, or

13:56.960 --> 13:57.960
I could just live in jail.

13:57.960 --> 13:58.960
Do jail, I think.

13:58.960 --> 13:59.960
You got beds and everything?

13:59.960 --> 14:02.960
You got beds.

14:02.960 --> 14:08.280
Somebody can scoot my desk up close to the bar so I can do work and stuff.

14:08.280 --> 14:09.640
I'll come back at the end of the day.

14:09.640 --> 14:10.640
You let me out, I'll come back.

14:10.640 --> 14:11.640
I got nowhere else to go.

14:11.640 --> 14:12.640
Yeah.

14:12.640 --> 14:14.760
I mean, you should lock me in for security's sake, and it's really locking out.

14:14.760 --> 14:15.760
I can't be trusted.

14:15.760 --> 14:16.760
I can't be trusted.

14:16.760 --> 14:17.760
Who knows?

14:17.760 --> 14:18.760
I'm a wild man.

14:18.760 --> 14:21.160
And then if you do get arrested for real, you're like used to it a little bit.

14:21.160 --> 14:23.920
It's like, you know, I'm just back at work.

14:23.920 --> 14:26.080
I'm just really, really busting my ass.

14:26.080 --> 14:28.600
I'm really spending the nights at the old office.

14:28.600 --> 14:30.600
How about another question?

14:30.600 --> 14:31.600
Here's another question.

14:31.600 --> 14:34.200
What?

14:34.200 --> 14:37.200
Tell me how to live my life.

14:37.200 --> 14:42.280
A few weeks ago, my girlfriend and I splurged on a fancy meal in an upscale restaurant.

14:42.280 --> 14:43.280
One of the courses...

14:43.280 --> 14:44.280
Already loving it.

14:44.280 --> 14:45.280
Oh, shit.

14:45.280 --> 14:46.280
Wait.

14:46.280 --> 14:47.280
Was it you?

14:47.280 --> 14:48.280
Oh, yeah.

14:48.280 --> 14:49.280
Wait, hold on.

14:49.280 --> 14:54.020
The only information you got is someone wrote in about splurging on a fancy meal, and only

14:54.020 --> 14:58.240
one person in the audience went, I think that's me.

14:58.240 --> 15:01.440
One of the courses was a Sunchoke dish garnished with dainty purple flowers.

15:01.440 --> 15:02.440
What dish?

15:02.440 --> 15:03.440
A Sunchoke dish?

15:03.440 --> 15:04.440
It's a type of fish?

15:04.440 --> 15:05.440
I believe it's a fish.

15:05.440 --> 15:06.440
Fish?

15:06.440 --> 15:09.320
Hey, is it a fish?

15:09.320 --> 15:12.160
What was that noise?

15:12.160 --> 15:13.160
Is it a fish?

15:13.160 --> 15:14.560
It's like an artichoke?

15:14.560 --> 15:18.960
I want one person to answer wherever I'm pointing into the void.

15:18.960 --> 15:20.520
I was pointing there.

15:20.520 --> 15:21.520
What is it?

15:21.520 --> 15:22.520
Okay.

15:22.520 --> 15:23.520
Okay.

15:23.520 --> 15:24.520
You don't have to fucking yell at me.

15:24.520 --> 15:25.520
Yeah, we're on stage with you.

15:25.520 --> 15:26.520
Okay.

15:26.520 --> 15:27.520
What's the demonstration?

15:27.520 --> 15:28.520
I got internet.

15:28.520 --> 15:32.520
You know what we were doing while you were learning about types of fish?

15:32.520 --> 15:37.680
We're at podcast school, getting our degrees in podcasts.

15:37.680 --> 15:41.680
Hey, this is like ginger.

15:41.680 --> 15:42.880
Nice try, Sunchoke.

15:42.880 --> 15:43.880
You're ginger.

15:43.880 --> 15:44.880
Got them again.

15:44.880 --> 15:48.920
It was a Sunchoke dish garnished with dainty purple flowers.

15:48.920 --> 15:55.240
I ate some of the flowers, and I thought they were okay, but I didn't eat them all in case

15:55.240 --> 15:56.960
they were just decoration.

15:56.960 --> 16:02.280
However, when the server cleared our table, he asked, sir, would you like to finish your

16:02.280 --> 16:06.760
flowers before I take your plate?

16:06.760 --> 16:11.800
So then I felt obligated to eat the flowers as he watched.

16:11.800 --> 16:14.200
I suddenly felt inexplicable shame as I chewed.

16:14.200 --> 16:16.580
I can't imagine why.

16:16.580 --> 16:22.080
His gaze seemed to suggest, yes, little fancy boy loves eating little purple flowers, doesn't

16:22.080 --> 16:23.080
he?

16:23.080 --> 16:24.560
I'm no stranger to public shame.

16:24.560 --> 16:30.560
I did magic in a talent show when I was six and later went on to play Oompa Loompa in

16:30.560 --> 16:36.000
a community theater production of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
Tick tick boom.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.920
My main question is this.

16:38.920 --> 16:42.160
Was this dude fucking with me?

16:42.160 --> 16:47.160
Am I wrong to feel like he was shaming me for being a fancy flower boy?

16:47.160 --> 16:50.040
As from Blossom Binging in Brooklyn.

16:50.040 --> 16:51.040
Yeah.

16:51.040 --> 16:54.480
Hey, whoever you are.

16:54.480 --> 16:57.680
I feel like I know you better than my brothers.

16:57.680 --> 17:02.240
Sometimes we finish a question and have to say like, we don't have enough information

17:02.240 --> 17:03.400
to answer this.

17:03.400 --> 17:04.400
That is not a problem.

17:04.400 --> 17:07.080
We totally see what's going on here.

17:07.080 --> 17:09.720
I take some of that information, put it aside, save it for the winter.

17:09.720 --> 17:15.000
You could have just written a question, I went to a place and a bully made me eat flowers.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.480
A bully made me eat a whole bouquet.

17:17.480 --> 17:20.040
What do I do now?

17:20.040 --> 17:21.840
But you are here though, right?

17:21.840 --> 17:23.920
Oh, you're real close.

17:23.920 --> 17:24.920
Okay.

17:24.920 --> 17:26.200
The flower eater.

17:26.200 --> 17:27.200
How do they taste?

17:27.200 --> 17:28.200
How do they taste for real?

17:28.200 --> 17:29.200
How do they taste?

17:29.200 --> 17:30.200
Why are you yelling at him?

17:30.200 --> 17:31.880
I'm really excited to find out.

17:31.880 --> 17:32.880
Compare it.

17:32.880 --> 17:33.880
What?

17:33.880 --> 17:34.880
Savory.

17:34.880 --> 17:40.280
Well, I can tell you where the floral element of it came from.

17:40.280 --> 17:43.000
No fucking root word.

17:43.000 --> 17:49.000
No pun intended because apparently this is a root vegetable, the Sunchoke.

17:49.000 --> 17:54.600
Is it possible that you weren't supposed to eat the flowers, but the guy had counted

17:54.600 --> 17:57.720
how many flowers are on the plate when he put them down, and he came back with five

17:57.720 --> 18:01.400
and he was like, do you want to eat the rest?

18:01.400 --> 18:03.360
You know what you're supposed to eat?

18:03.360 --> 18:05.320
Anything you could swallow.

18:05.320 --> 18:09.840
No, you've had a baby for too long, that's not actually true.

18:09.840 --> 18:16.120
Fucking markers, crayons, dice, it's all good in the hood.

18:16.120 --> 18:21.000
My brothers played, I was trying to get my baby to eat while still buffering was on,

18:21.000 --> 18:25.000
my brothers played restaurant with her backstage.

18:25.000 --> 18:28.160
What kind of wild and crazy rock star shenanigans do we get on?

18:28.160 --> 18:29.160
Good question.

18:29.160 --> 18:33.920
And then 45 minutes later, I said the sentence, oh yeah, they horny for this one.

18:33.920 --> 18:35.160
So it all balances out.

18:35.160 --> 18:36.480
We're very complex individuals.

18:36.480 --> 18:38.720
That's how I come at you, hot and cold.

18:38.720 --> 18:41.720
Let's say this, though, they got her to eat some chicken quesadilla, so what's up now?

18:41.720 --> 18:43.680
Mission accomplished.

18:43.680 --> 18:47.600
You ate the flowers, though, and that's great.

18:47.600 --> 18:50.640
There's no part of that that doesn't make me very, very happy.

18:50.640 --> 18:52.080
I like that.

18:52.080 --> 18:56.440
This is to any other living person, I don't want to put you on blast, I'm saying it's

18:56.440 --> 19:01.080
a beautiful thing you've done here.

19:01.080 --> 19:07.040
Eating flowers is an in for a penny, in for a pound situation where you either don't eat

19:07.040 --> 19:13.600
the flowers because they're plants, or you eat all the flowers because it's like, hey

19:13.600 --> 19:15.080
when in Rome, nom nom nom nom.

19:15.080 --> 19:18.520
You can't rule out plants from being eaten.

19:18.520 --> 19:24.720
Right, but like, the point he's making is, if they're decoration, you're not off the

19:24.720 --> 19:26.600
hook by eating some.

19:26.600 --> 19:27.600
Yeah.

19:27.600 --> 19:30.840
Like, no, I just ate some of the decoration.

19:30.840 --> 19:33.080
Is this an ice cream bar or a candle?

19:33.080 --> 19:36.200
I'm going to take six to seven bites out of it.

19:36.200 --> 19:37.880
No, you've committed.

19:37.880 --> 19:40.280
You're eating the whole candle now.

19:40.280 --> 19:44.560
You need the waiter to come back and go, where is the candle, and you go, yum yum.

19:44.560 --> 19:45.560
Yum yum in my belly.

19:45.560 --> 19:48.640
Might I suggest the next time this happens, should this happen again or happen to anyone

19:48.640 --> 19:53.560
out there, you eat two flowers, the person says, would you like to finish the flower,

19:53.560 --> 20:00.640
and you go, no, they're not the best I've had, and you big time them right back.

20:00.640 --> 20:01.640
I've had better flowers.

20:01.640 --> 20:08.160
I will say this though, I've got a super pretty tummy, and you show them your tummy.

20:08.160 --> 20:09.160
They'll love that.

20:09.160 --> 20:10.160
They love that.

20:10.160 --> 20:12.680
That's what restaurants do.

20:12.680 --> 20:16.880
You want to do another Yahoo?

20:16.880 --> 20:17.880
Yeah.

20:17.880 --> 20:18.880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:18.880 --> 20:19.880
Oops.

20:19.880 --> 20:20.880
I lost the name on this one.

20:20.880 --> 20:21.880
Dang it.

20:21.880 --> 20:22.880
I'll find it.

20:22.880 --> 20:23.880
Here we go.

20:23.880 --> 20:24.880
It's also from Rachel Rosen.

20:24.880 --> 20:25.880
Game Recognized Game.

20:25.880 --> 20:26.880
Fuck.

20:26.880 --> 20:28.240
It's a lot of game recognition going on.

20:28.240 --> 20:37.520
It's from Yahoo Answers user, they're anonymous, and you're about to know why.

20:37.520 --> 20:42.320
This anonymous user will call Derek, yeah.

20:42.320 --> 20:44.320
Got it in one.

20:44.320 --> 20:49.040
Derek asks, help me add to and improve a standup I'm writing.

20:49.040 --> 20:54.120
Most of it's observational humor.

20:54.120 --> 20:55.120
Buckle up.

20:55.120 --> 20:56.120
We got you.

20:56.120 --> 20:57.120
Ideas so far.

20:57.120 --> 21:00.120
Let's just run through some of these bullet points.

21:00.120 --> 21:02.480
Some standup comedy ideas.

21:02.480 --> 21:04.400
Should I stand up and just deliver something?

21:04.400 --> 21:05.400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

21:05.400 --> 21:07.760
If we didn't have any of you, we wouldn't stand up.

21:07.760 --> 21:09.960
Let me get that spotlight.

21:09.960 --> 21:10.960
Okay, okay, okay.

21:10.960 --> 21:11.960
All right.

21:11.960 --> 21:13.520
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

21:13.520 --> 21:16.520
Our phones fall and we panic, right?

21:16.520 --> 21:17.580
Our friends fall.

21:17.580 --> 21:18.580
We laugh.

21:18.580 --> 21:19.580
Hey, guys.

21:19.580 --> 21:20.580
Phones, they're getting bigger.

21:20.580 --> 21:21.580
Our laptops are getting smaller.

21:21.580 --> 21:47.200
The best reaction you get from that is someone going, yes.

21:47.200 --> 21:49.200
There's no laughter at that standup show.

21:49.200 --> 21:51.200
Phones getting bigger, laptops getting smaller.

21:51.200 --> 21:52.200
Yes.

21:52.200 --> 21:53.200
Agreed.

21:53.200 --> 21:54.200
They certainly are.

21:54.200 --> 21:55.200
I noticed.

21:55.200 --> 21:56.200
Uh-huh.

21:56.200 --> 21:57.200
Hey, guys.

21:57.200 --> 22:02.000
If there's no talking during the movie, isn't it then a silent movie?

22:02.000 --> 22:04.680
No, it's fucking not.

22:04.680 --> 22:05.680
But hold on.

22:05.680 --> 22:07.240
They played into the bit.

22:07.240 --> 22:10.000
Think about it, because it's not.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.160
Oh, that's the joke.

22:12.160 --> 22:13.760
Yes, yes, and no?

22:13.760 --> 22:14.760
No.

22:14.760 --> 22:16.880
Vin Diesel's saying words up there in Fast 7.

22:16.880 --> 22:21.020
You can hear them.

22:21.020 --> 22:22.920
When a guy likes a girl, he looks her in the eye.

22:22.920 --> 22:25.040
When a girl likes a guy, she looks away.

22:25.040 --> 22:28.700
Again, you're just, it's patently untrue.

22:28.700 --> 22:31.600
But also, what's the punchline there?

22:31.600 --> 22:33.720
Just, the sky's blue.

22:33.720 --> 22:34.720
Hey, guys.

22:34.720 --> 22:37.920
Why does chicken, why does chicken mean wimp?

22:37.920 --> 22:40.920
A chicken will peck you to pieces.

22:40.920 --> 22:41.920
So a little bit of that.

22:41.920 --> 22:42.920
That's how I lost my brother.

22:42.920 --> 22:45.920
That's a rural Seinfeld.

22:45.920 --> 22:51.000
Okay, like, we're all having a lot of fun here, but let's all agree.

22:51.000 --> 22:56.000
If we saw a human being, like us, you know how we're humans?

22:56.000 --> 23:02.580
If we saw a human being stand on stage and say these things as jokes, it would be literally

23:02.580 --> 23:05.440
the funniest comedian I've ever seen in my entire life.

23:05.440 --> 23:08.400
But not, I would argue, for the right reasons.

23:08.400 --> 23:09.400
Right reasons.

23:09.400 --> 23:13.440
But if, hey, guys, right reasons.

23:13.440 --> 23:20.240
The word none, though, this one's real, is just the letter N doing a cartwheel.

23:20.240 --> 23:25.920
You have to think about that one for like 45 fucking seconds, but once you get there,

23:25.920 --> 23:26.920
it's good.

23:26.920 --> 23:33.260
Hey, no word, no word in the English language rhymes with month.

23:33.260 --> 23:34.260
That's another one.

23:34.260 --> 23:37.600
That wasn't just some weird non sequitur that I did.

23:37.600 --> 23:41.540
Let's just punch these up real quick, guys.

23:41.540 --> 23:44.400
Do we have to do other jokes other than these jokes?

23:44.400 --> 23:46.640
Our phones fall, we panic.

23:46.640 --> 23:48.600
Our friends fall, we laugh.

23:48.600 --> 23:53.280
What if your friend is like playing Angry Birds on your phone and like asteroid lands

23:53.280 --> 23:59.280
on both of them and you lose both and you're just, your reaction is just.

23:59.280 --> 24:00.280
I'm neutral.

24:00.280 --> 24:02.200
I'm completely neutral about this.

24:02.200 --> 24:03.200
I don't know.

24:03.200 --> 24:05.560
All those two events, they both canceled each other out.

24:05.560 --> 24:13.040
My friend is dead, but my tiny phone is also dead.

24:13.040 --> 24:18.880
It's very funny that my friend died, but very sad that my phone died.

24:18.880 --> 24:27.600
Derek, oh my God, you're just standing there doing something.

24:27.600 --> 24:28.840
Can I still get my numbers?

24:28.840 --> 24:31.440
Are those in the cloud?

24:31.440 --> 24:35.280
I'll tell you who is in the cloud.

24:35.280 --> 24:37.280
James.

24:37.280 --> 24:43.400
Now see, that's a bit.

24:43.400 --> 24:46.920
We did do the shit.

24:46.920 --> 24:47.920
That's a tight five.

24:47.920 --> 24:48.920
Thank you.

24:48.920 --> 24:49.920
That's my time.

24:49.920 --> 24:50.920
Thank you.

24:50.920 --> 24:51.920
That's my time.

24:51.920 --> 24:52.920
You want to hear another question?

24:52.920 --> 24:53.920
Or do you want to punch up some more of those bad boys?

24:53.920 --> 24:57.120
No, I've literally, I can't anymore.

24:57.120 --> 25:01.720
At the grocery store line, the clerk got to my last item, a large bag of cherries.

25:01.720 --> 25:02.720
Okay.

25:02.720 --> 25:03.720
I love this crowd.

25:03.720 --> 25:09.160
This is the second time in a row, somebody's like, oh, here comes my shit.

25:09.160 --> 25:10.160
Everybody listen.

25:10.160 --> 25:11.160
Shut up.

25:11.160 --> 25:12.160
Shut up.

25:12.160 --> 25:13.160
Here comes the drop.

25:13.160 --> 25:14.160
Here comes my jam.

25:14.160 --> 25:15.160
Okay.

25:15.160 --> 25:19.480
At the grocery store checkout line, the clerk got to my last item, a large bag of cherries.

25:19.480 --> 25:34.520
They looked at the bag, then at me and said, you know, these are expensive, right?

25:34.520 --> 25:41.120
It's such a fucking, that's like a nuclear bird from like deployed from orbit.

25:41.120 --> 25:43.640
So fucking good.

25:43.640 --> 25:49.360
Asking them to clarify might have sent the conversation to a super judgy place.

25:49.360 --> 25:51.600
But in the future, too late, too late.

25:51.600 --> 25:56.240
How should I handle egregious displays of fiscal judgment from cashiers or other service

25:56.240 --> 26:00.560
personnel that's from swimming in subtext?

26:00.560 --> 26:02.160
And that was you who laughed at it.

26:02.160 --> 26:03.160
Yes.

26:03.160 --> 26:04.160
Oh, shit.

26:04.160 --> 26:05.160
Okay.

26:05.160 --> 26:06.160
Somebody was just like, yeah, buy some cherries.

26:06.160 --> 26:07.160
Are you here?

26:07.160 --> 26:08.160
Are you here?

26:08.160 --> 26:09.160
Hi.

26:09.160 --> 26:10.160
Hi.

26:10.160 --> 26:11.160
Hi.

26:11.160 --> 26:12.160
You are here.

26:12.160 --> 26:13.160
How are the cherries?

26:13.160 --> 26:14.160
Moldy.

26:14.160 --> 26:15.160
Moldy?

26:15.160 --> 26:16.160
What the fuck?

26:16.160 --> 26:20.880
Are these your artisanal molded cherries?

26:20.880 --> 26:22.720
Did you take them back after like that?

26:22.720 --> 26:28.480
You were a real shithead to me and look at your garbage cherries.

26:28.480 --> 26:33.560
At these prices, maybe they, did they kind of, were they patronizing when they said it?

26:33.560 --> 26:34.560
Like, did you?

26:34.560 --> 26:35.560
How could they not be?

26:35.560 --> 26:36.560
Yeah.

26:36.560 --> 26:37.560
Like.

26:37.560 --> 26:38.560
You know these are expensive, right?

26:38.560 --> 26:39.560
Good job.

26:39.560 --> 26:40.560
You did great.

26:40.560 --> 26:46.000
Did you, did you mean to get grapes?

26:46.000 --> 26:47.600
Come on.

26:47.600 --> 26:48.600
Come on, sweetheart.

26:48.600 --> 26:53.480
Hey, why don't I put those, why don't I take those back for you and get you some grapes?

26:53.480 --> 26:55.200
You know grapes.

26:55.200 --> 26:56.560
You ever have raisins?

26:56.560 --> 26:58.920
They're like dope raisins.

26:58.920 --> 26:59.920
Pre raisins.

26:59.920 --> 27:00.920
I call them.

27:00.920 --> 27:01.920
Come on.

27:01.920 --> 27:02.920
Super wet raisins.

27:02.920 --> 27:03.920
They're good as heck.

27:03.920 --> 27:05.360
You're going to love eating these.

27:05.360 --> 27:07.080
Grapes are like your cherries.

27:07.080 --> 27:08.080
You know what?

27:08.080 --> 27:09.080
Hold on.

27:09.080 --> 27:10.640
Why don't you eat one cherry?

27:10.640 --> 27:11.640
Just so I can watch.

27:11.640 --> 27:12.640
This is going to be adorable.

27:12.640 --> 27:13.640
Oh, it's sour, isn't it?

27:13.640 --> 27:14.640
Wait, let me.

27:14.640 --> 27:15.640
A little bit sweet.

27:15.640 --> 27:17.720
Oh, there's a hard thing in the middle.

27:17.720 --> 27:18.720
Let me find this.

27:18.720 --> 27:19.720
Hold on.

27:19.720 --> 27:20.720
Oh, that's cute.

27:20.720 --> 27:21.720
Look at him go.

27:21.720 --> 27:23.440
Look at him eat that cherry for the first time.

27:23.440 --> 27:24.440
What a sweet boy.

27:24.440 --> 27:29.320
That'll be a hundred dollars because that was a fucking cherry you just ate.

27:29.320 --> 27:35.840
They put those as the symbol on slot machines for a reason because you're rich.

27:35.840 --> 27:39.440
The problem is if someone asked the question, you know, these are expensive, right?

27:39.440 --> 27:43.360
There's literally no way to like come out from under that burn.

27:43.360 --> 27:44.360
You can't say yes.

27:44.360 --> 27:46.880
Like, and sound like an adult.

27:46.880 --> 27:47.880
Okay.

27:47.880 --> 27:49.360
Here's the old, like there's no cool way.

27:49.360 --> 27:50.360
You're right, Travis.

27:50.360 --> 27:55.840
Because what, and one answer is, oh no, that sucks.

27:55.840 --> 28:01.000
The other answer is, hell yeah, let it ride.

28:01.000 --> 28:02.120
This was just for me.

28:02.120 --> 28:03.120
I had a good month.

28:03.120 --> 28:04.120
Hell yeah.

28:04.120 --> 28:05.120
I know they're expensive.

28:05.120 --> 28:06.120
I love cherries.

28:06.120 --> 28:07.120
I earned this shit.

28:07.120 --> 28:08.120
I promised myself.

28:08.120 --> 28:17.560
He said one day I would walk in here and I would buy the cherries.

28:17.560 --> 28:23.320
I saw the rich man when I was a kid and I said one day, that'll be me.

28:23.320 --> 28:24.680
I've earned this.

28:24.680 --> 28:29.120
Just say no and like ask if you could have someone help you back with them because you're

28:29.120 --> 28:33.600
worried you'll drop them and you can't afford it.

28:33.600 --> 28:35.240
You know there's this, I do.

28:35.240 --> 28:37.560
Could you pretend to put them in the bag, please?

28:37.560 --> 28:40.320
Just don't let people see you put them in the bag.

28:40.320 --> 28:41.320
My boss is here.

28:41.320 --> 28:42.760
Yeah, do put grapes in there.

28:42.760 --> 28:44.200
Yes, of course, of course, of course.

28:44.200 --> 28:45.200
Of course I fucked up.

28:45.200 --> 28:46.200
Thank you for asking.

28:46.200 --> 28:47.200
Thank you.

28:47.200 --> 28:48.200
They look super duper similar.

28:48.200 --> 28:49.200
Okay.

28:49.200 --> 28:53.080
You're going to understand how I slipped up, but of course I want grapes instead.

28:53.080 --> 28:54.080
Can we get-

28:54.080 --> 28:55.080
Yeah.

28:55.080 --> 28:56.080
Can we do our special-

28:56.080 --> 28:57.080
No, no.

28:57.080 --> 28:58.080
I want the one.

28:58.080 --> 28:59.080
I want the one.

28:59.080 --> 29:04.600
You've been teasing with it for two shows about the TV question.

29:04.600 --> 29:05.600
Okay.

29:05.600 --> 29:06.600
All right.

29:06.600 --> 29:07.600
We've got a wonderful-

29:07.600 --> 29:08.600
Type two.

29:08.600 --> 29:11.080
We're going to do a type two about this Yahoo that's sent in by Aaron Keyes.

29:11.080 --> 29:12.080
Thank you, Aaron Keyes.

29:12.080 --> 29:13.080
I'm sorry-

29:13.080 --> 29:16.720
Remember, you credit me for whatever happens in the next two minutes unless it's bad.

29:16.720 --> 29:17.720
Okay.

29:17.720 --> 29:18.720
Thank you, Aaron Keyes.

29:18.720 --> 29:19.720
It's from Yahoo.

29:19.720 --> 29:34.640
Answers user lalizard who asks, in home improvement, are the sons related to Tim Allen?

29:34.640 --> 29:43.160
They look so much like him.

29:43.160 --> 29:49.200
In the series Home Improvement, Tim Allen has three sons, Brad, Randy, and Mark.

29:49.200 --> 29:51.560
Two of the kids look exactly like Tim Allen.

29:51.560 --> 29:55.480
I'm frustrated.

29:55.480 --> 29:56.480
Which two?

29:56.480 --> 29:57.840
I have to know.

29:57.840 --> 29:59.520
Are they related in any way?

29:59.520 --> 30:03.400
Maybe not as actual sons in real life, but maybe his nephews or something.

30:03.400 --> 30:06.120
You're already backpedaling.

30:06.120 --> 30:07.400
They just have to be related.

30:07.400 --> 30:08.400
Can someone please help?

30:08.400 --> 30:09.400
It's killing me.

30:09.400 --> 30:10.400
It's killing me.

30:10.400 --> 30:16.560
I think about those sons from Home Improvement so much.

30:16.560 --> 30:23.080
If they're not related, I don't even know what to think.

30:23.080 --> 30:26.240
Which two look like Tim Allen?

30:26.240 --> 30:28.440
It doesn't matter.

30:28.440 --> 30:30.040
Are they related?

30:30.040 --> 30:35.640
That would be weird, though, if they got two of his sons in their neighborhood friends.

30:35.640 --> 30:36.640
Stupid Reggie.

30:36.640 --> 30:37.640
We wanted three.

30:37.640 --> 30:38.640
Do you got anybody else?

30:38.640 --> 30:39.640
We got stupid Reggie.

30:39.640 --> 30:40.640
Stupid Reggie are friends of mine.

30:40.640 --> 30:41.640
We only expected this to go a season.

30:41.640 --> 30:42.640
Yeah, he's a doofus.

30:42.640 --> 30:43.640
You want him for the acting?

30:43.640 --> 30:44.640
We can get him.

30:44.640 --> 30:45.640
He's cheap.

30:45.640 --> 30:55.560
I always did assume they were the love child of Tim Allen and Richard Karn.

30:55.560 --> 30:56.560
They-

30:56.560 --> 30:57.560
Those are Richard Karn's boys.

30:57.560 --> 30:58.560
Yeah.

30:58.560 --> 30:59.560
Oh, the Karn boys?

30:59.560 --> 31:00.560
Oh, the Karn boys.

31:00.560 --> 31:01.560
Yeah, I love those guys.

31:01.560 --> 31:03.280
Karn boys are at it again.

31:03.280 --> 31:07.280
They experience Karnal pleasures and they-

31:07.280 --> 31:10.200
Shut the fuck up.

31:10.200 --> 31:11.200
I'm just saying-

31:11.200 --> 31:12.200
Go to prison.

31:12.200 --> 31:13.200
Oh my God.

31:13.200 --> 31:19.000
If he ever had a late nights and weekend R&B show, that would be like the greatest time.

31:19.000 --> 31:20.000
Like he's a DJ.

31:20.000 --> 31:21.000
Karnal pleasures.

31:21.000 --> 31:22.000
You're listening.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.720
We talked about this on the show, but he does host a celebrity golf tournament called The

31:24.720 --> 31:25.720
Carnival.

31:25.720 --> 31:26.720
That's legit and real.

31:26.720 --> 31:28.560
And you can buy tickets to just like go to it.

31:28.560 --> 31:30.360
And I guess just hang out with Rich.

31:30.360 --> 31:31.360
Rich.

31:31.360 --> 31:32.360
With Sweet Rich.

31:32.360 --> 31:36.160
But no, they definitely junior'd each other, Tim Allen and Richard Karn.

31:36.160 --> 31:42.320
Did you see that movie Junior where Tim Allen had sex with Richard Karn?

31:42.320 --> 31:43.320
I haven't seen-

31:43.320 --> 31:45.200
It must not get blue.

31:45.200 --> 31:46.200
It was romantic.

31:46.200 --> 31:47.200
Tender.

31:47.200 --> 31:48.200
Yeah.

31:48.200 --> 31:49.200
Tender.

31:49.200 --> 31:50.200
They meant it.

31:50.200 --> 31:51.200
I heard full penetration.

31:51.200 --> 31:57.240
I didn't see the movie Junior, but the best scene in it was when Arnold Schwarzenegger

31:57.240 --> 32:02.080
and Dane DeVito, I assume, may love for 30 minutes tenderly-

32:02.080 --> 32:03.080
30 minutes.

32:03.080 --> 32:04.080
It was a third of the movie.

32:04.080 --> 32:05.080
Yeah.

32:05.080 --> 32:09.800
They went from, cover your ears if you don't want to hear this, from fully soft.

32:09.800 --> 32:12.500
Like you saw every act, every part of it.

32:12.500 --> 32:15.000
Like them coming in the front door and putting their keys down.

32:15.000 --> 32:16.000
Like how was your day?

32:16.000 --> 32:17.000
Like I'm feeling it.

32:17.000 --> 32:18.000
You feeling it?

32:18.000 --> 32:19.000
Yeah.

32:19.000 --> 32:20.000
Fully soft.

32:20.000 --> 32:21.000
Well, not right now, but like maybe in two minutes.

32:21.000 --> 32:22.000
Okay, great.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.360
Let's eat some pasta.

32:24.360 --> 32:27.360
We got to carve up.

32:27.360 --> 32:32.480
This is going to go long.

32:32.480 --> 32:33.480
That was all you.

32:33.480 --> 32:44.800
Just want to go ahead and put that disclaimer back on there.

32:44.800 --> 32:51.920
Folks, we hate to break into the action here, but we want to take a second-

32:51.920 --> 32:54.240
This nonstop thrill a minute.

32:54.240 --> 32:55.240
Chill a minute.

32:55.240 --> 32:56.240
Action.

32:56.240 --> 32:57.240
Disaster.

32:57.240 --> 32:58.240
Chill a minute.

32:58.240 --> 32:59.840
Hey, why don't you chill for a bit?

32:59.840 --> 33:01.400
Let us sell you some shit.

33:01.400 --> 33:05.600

Let me try again.

33:29.800 --> 33:32.880

Now how good is Squarespace websites, you ask?

33:52.600 --> 33:59.240
I'm glad that you did ask because I made a website inside of which I trapped my brother

33:59.240 --> 34:00.240
Travis McElroy.

34:00.240 --> 34:02.440
Yeah, kind of a Phantom Zone type thing.

34:02.440 --> 34:06.360
It's like a Phantom Zone place where I've trapped Travis and now he spends his days

34:06.360 --> 34:12.880
surfing the web helping teens solve mysteries and cyberbullying a lot.

34:12.880 --> 34:16.600
Is he doing the cyberbullying or is he stopping it or what's up helping the teens?

34:16.600 --> 34:20.160
He's doing it a lot and he's very good at it because he is cyber.

34:20.160 --> 34:21.160
He is cyber.

34:21.160 --> 34:22.160
Hey, goofball.

34:22.160 --> 34:25.120
By the way, Travis is in the cyber dimension.

34:25.120 --> 34:26.120
That's right.

34:26.120 --> 34:27.120
He's not here.

34:27.120 --> 34:29.360
He's also at MaxFunCon, which I didn't fucking know he's going to.

34:29.360 --> 34:30.360
That's cool.

34:30.360 --> 34:31.360
That's cool.

34:31.360 --> 34:32.360
Have fun.

34:32.360 --> 34:33.360
I guess we don't tell each other things.

34:33.360 --> 34:34.360
We're not really a unit, huh?

34:34.360 --> 34:35.360
Kind of fun.

34:35.360 --> 34:36.360
We're a package deal.

34:36.360 --> 34:37.360
Interesting.

34:37.360 --> 34:38.360
Kind of broke away from the shark pack, huh?

34:38.360 --> 34:39.360
Tell me about Bowlin Branch.

34:39.360 --> 34:40.360
Let's tell you about Bowlin Branch.

34:40.360 --> 34:41.360
Bowlin Branch is the place to go-

34:41.360 --> 34:42.840
My name's Bowlin Branch.

34:42.840 --> 34:43.840
Okay.

34:43.840 --> 34:44.840
Hi, Bowlin Branch.

34:44.840 --> 34:47.680
My name's Bowlin Branch and I want to sell you some sheets.

34:47.680 --> 34:50.120
Yeah, that's what they do at Bowlin Branch.

34:50.120 --> 34:55.040
No, it's just Bowlin Branch and what they do is they send you nice, nice sheets.

34:55.040 --> 35:00.720
They have streamlined the sheets buying and sleeping upon process.

35:00.720 --> 35:02.680
You got some Bowlin Branch at your place, right?

35:02.680 --> 35:04.160
Yeah, I love it.

35:04.160 --> 35:06.760
We say this all the time on Sawbones.

35:06.760 --> 35:08.520
We do not sleep on other sheets.

35:08.520 --> 35:11.680
When those sheets are dirty, we wash those sheets and then put them back on the bed.

35:11.680 --> 35:12.680
We have other sheets.

35:12.680 --> 35:13.680
We don't sleep on them.

35:13.680 --> 35:14.680
It's just Bowlin Branch.

35:14.680 --> 35:19.800
We're talking about luxury at a sensible price.

35:19.800 --> 35:21.480
Sensible but luxurious.

You want to see how good they feel?

35:22.680 --> 35:25.180

35:25.180 --> 35:26.180
You don't love them?

They'll let you send them back.

36:04.680 --> 36:05.680
Got it.

36:05.680 --> 36:08.360
Who says, happy birthday six months ago.

36:08.360 --> 36:10.520
Well, was that worth the wait?

36:10.520 --> 36:13.680
Since this is halfway late, it counts as halfway early, so you're welcome.

36:13.680 --> 36:17.680
Love you muchly and even though I know part of your heart belongs to three other dudes,

36:17.680 --> 36:20.800
they are brothers and married and that's gross.

36:20.800 --> 36:22.120
Get it together, Grady.

36:22.120 --> 36:26.200
You're still always numbers one through five with me.

36:26.200 --> 36:27.200
Smoot.

36:27.200 --> 36:32.920
Wait, that might be the beginning of the word smooth, but I do very much like, here's the

36:32.920 --> 36:33.920
thing.

36:33.920 --> 36:34.920
Slang term for smooching.

36:34.920 --> 36:41.560
Right, or salutations or my condolences or best regards.

36:41.560 --> 36:42.880
That shit, it's done.

36:42.880 --> 36:43.880
Now?

36:43.880 --> 36:44.880
Over with.

36:44.880 --> 36:45.880
When you're done, when you send an email?

36:45.880 --> 36:46.880
Smoot.

36:46.880 --> 36:47.880
Smoot.

36:47.880 --> 36:48.880
I love that.

36:48.880 --> 36:52.120
So we got another personal message here.

36:52.120 --> 37:00.060
Another sort of, I think you could call it an e-smoot from Claire Winnick and sorry,

37:00.060 --> 37:05.920
it is for Claire Winnick and it is from the sweet baby Nichols brother, Jake.

37:05.920 --> 37:07.820
And that's her name is pronounced Nichols.

37:07.820 --> 37:08.820
So I got it right.

37:08.820 --> 37:10.160
Yeah, you did very good.

37:10.160 --> 37:11.240
No problem there.

37:11.240 --> 37:12.240
Happy 30th birthday.

37:12.240 --> 37:18.200
It says, there seemed to be no greater gift than immortalizing you in the intricate mythology

37:18.200 --> 37:23.400
of the bim bamma verse nestled on the shelves of an Indiana Jones-esque warehouse somewhere

37:23.400 --> 37:25.560
between the lost gushy tapes.

37:25.560 --> 37:26.560
They're never getting out.

37:26.560 --> 37:27.560
Stop asking.

37:27.560 --> 37:30.160
And I literally, I don't have, they were deleted.

37:30.160 --> 37:31.600
Do you not, do you guys understand?

37:31.600 --> 37:35.960
When I delete, when I edit something out of a podcast, I don't take that audio and then

37:35.960 --> 37:39.300
put it in a little folder and say like for savesies.

37:39.300 --> 37:40.300
It goes to hell.

37:40.300 --> 37:42.560
It goes to deleted hell.

37:42.560 --> 37:46.820
Between the gushy tapes and Willem Dafoe in a handmade green goblin costume, your name

37:46.820 --> 37:53.200
will live eternally in semi-obscurity what you've always wanted and that is for Claire.

37:53.200 --> 37:55.720
Happy 30th birthday, Claire, and that's from Jake.

37:55.720 --> 37:57.480
So thanks, baby Jake.

37:57.480 --> 37:58.480
Thank you, Jake.

37:58.480 --> 37:59.480
Jake from State Farm.

37:59.480 --> 38:00.480
Magic baby Jake.

38:00.480 --> 38:04.720
I like anytime anybody says Jake, I like to say like Jake from State Farm, like the commercial.

38:04.720 --> 38:09.320
Well, it's worth asking because one out of a million, the person's gonna say yeah, in

38:09.320 --> 38:10.320
fact.

38:10.320 --> 38:11.320
Yeah, that is actually me, Jake from State Farm.

38:11.320 --> 38:12.320
That's me.

38:12.320 --> 38:13.320
I'm Jake from State Farm.

38:13.320 --> 38:15.000
Anyway, that's gonna do it for us.

38:15.000 --> 38:20.460
For the ad portion of our program, we got a lot more jokes for you, lots of jokes.

38:20.460 --> 38:23.120
Thank you everybody who came out to all the live shows in DC and New York.

38:23.120 --> 38:24.120
Thanks to John Hodgman.

38:24.120 --> 38:27.600
Is he out there yet or did I just ruin the surprise?

38:27.600 --> 38:28.600
I don't know.

38:28.600 --> 38:29.600
We gotta think of him at some point.

38:29.600 --> 38:30.600
I'm gonna thank him right now.

38:30.600 --> 38:34.920
Thanks John Hodgman for your help with the show.

38:34.920 --> 38:35.920
And we had a great time.

38:35.920 --> 38:37.280
Hope everybody who came out did too.

38:37.280 --> 38:38.680
Boston, we're coming for you, dawg.

38:38.680 --> 38:39.920
Those shows sold out.

38:39.920 --> 38:40.920
Thanks Boston.

38:40.920 --> 38:41.920
Thanks Beantown.

38:41.920 --> 38:42.920
Watch your butt.

38:42.920 --> 38:43.920
Watch your butt, Beantown.

38:43.920 --> 38:44.920
Smoot.

38:44.920 --> 38:45.920
Smoot.

38:45.920 --> 38:46.920
Hey guys, this is Adam Conover.

38:46.920 --> 38:49.160
You may know me from my true TV show, Adam Ruins Everything.

38:49.160 --> 38:50.160
Well guess what?

38:50.160 --> 38:53.200
Now we're doing a podcast version right here on Maximum Fun.

38:53.200 --> 38:56.360
What we do is we take all the interesting, fascinating experts that we talked to for

38:56.360 --> 39:00.760
just a couple minutes on the show and we sit with them for an entire podcast, really going

39:00.760 --> 39:04.240
deep and getting into the fascinating details of their work.

39:04.240 --> 39:09.000
And Adam Ruins Everything wherever you get your podcasts or at MaximumFun.org.

39:09.000 --> 39:10.400
So we do our, we have a thing.

39:10.400 --> 39:12.080
Okay, so like a couple weeks ago.

39:12.080 --> 39:15.000
I have the thing here, the OG.

39:15.000 --> 39:17.840
Don't read the OG, but do read the OG story.

39:17.840 --> 39:18.840
Okay.

39:18.840 --> 39:19.840
Okay.

39:19.840 --> 39:23.780
My Brother, My Brother and Me episode 304, a very recent one.

39:23.780 --> 39:28.720
We had, we do a segment in the middle of the show called The Money Zone, which is where

39:28.720 --> 39:29.720
we get paid.

39:29.720 --> 39:38.040
And in episode 304, we had a very special part of The Money Zone where somebody sent

39:38.040 --> 39:44.600
in a message that was unfortunately the funniest thing that's maybe ever happened on the show.

39:44.600 --> 39:46.960
They are, what are their names, Griffin?

39:46.960 --> 39:51.960
Their names are Avital and Rishi.

39:51.960 --> 39:53.880
And who put who on blast?

39:53.880 --> 39:59.680
Rishi put Avital so fucking on blast that they were like pushed 10 feet into the ground.

39:59.680 --> 40:03.480
And it was so good.

40:03.480 --> 40:06.840
And the first off, let me say they're here.

40:06.840 --> 40:07.840
Oh yeah.

40:07.840 --> 40:08.840
Yeah.

40:08.840 --> 40:09.840
Avital and Rishi, you guys here?

40:09.840 --> 40:10.840
Just stand up real quick.

40:10.840 --> 40:11.840
Perfect.

40:11.840 --> 40:12.840
Thank you.

40:12.840 --> 40:13.840
Oh, front row, center.

40:13.840 --> 40:14.840
Thank you.

40:14.840 --> 40:15.840
Hello.

40:15.840 --> 40:16.840
The best.

40:16.840 --> 40:17.840
The best.

40:17.840 --> 40:19.760
Thank you for, this is the fucking funniest thing that's ever happened.

40:19.760 --> 40:24.800
Now it's a message about, it's a message of, I mean, it's about Coldplay, but it's really

40:24.800 --> 40:25.800
about Rebirth.

40:25.800 --> 40:27.840
Rebirth, I guess.

40:27.840 --> 40:32.680
And it was a, we should set it up a little bit more, a live journal message that Avital

40:32.680 --> 40:39.160
wrote a while ago about Coldplay and how transformative seeing Coldplay was.

40:39.160 --> 40:44.400
We read some of the message, but there wasn't enough room in the Jumbotron to read the whole

40:44.400 --> 40:45.400
message.

40:45.400 --> 40:48.320
So we have it in its entirety.

40:48.320 --> 40:52.360
And we debated back and forth about which one of us would read it.

40:52.360 --> 40:54.420
And the answer was none of us.

40:54.420 --> 40:59.600
So without further ado, we'd like to welcome to the stage, John Hodgman.

40:59.600 --> 41:00.600
Coldplay.

41:00.600 --> 41:05.400
Keep it, keep it up guys.

41:05.400 --> 41:14.840
He really needs a, okay, wait, wait, hold on, time out, time out.

41:14.840 --> 41:17.800
Coldplay comes on.

41:17.800 --> 41:20.460
My God.

41:20.460 --> 41:35.560
When they had started up in my place and I saw him on stage and he was singing to heaven.

41:35.560 --> 41:41.840
I swear his arms were outstretched.

41:41.840 --> 42:06.240
He was just so at peace with himself and everything, just so free.

42:06.240 --> 42:13.640
Are we not done?

42:13.640 --> 42:16.920
I started crying.

42:16.920 --> 42:21.080
Not just crying, sobbing.

42:21.080 --> 42:30.840
I dredged everything up and everything melted away.

42:30.840 --> 42:36.600
But it was me and the words.

42:36.600 --> 42:57.560
I cried for everything bad that had happened to anyone.

42:57.560 --> 43:05.600
That people live in fear, that there is injustice and cruelty.

43:05.600 --> 43:12.520
And that I take what I have for granted.

43:12.520 --> 43:21.640
I cried on behalf of everything.

43:21.640 --> 43:29.520
Oh God.

43:29.520 --> 43:35.520
And he sang.

43:35.520 --> 43:48.160
No one ever said it would be easy.

43:48.160 --> 44:00.080
And I, I knew what he meant.

44:00.080 --> 44:05.960
It was so meaningful.

44:05.960 --> 44:09.380
It sounds dumb.

44:09.380 --> 44:12.820
It sounds dumb.

44:12.820 --> 44:37.160
When I was momentarily at peace myself, Coldplay is so awesome.

44:37.160 --> 44:57.120
All I needed was yellow.

44:57.120 --> 45:06.000
All I needed was yellow.

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
And I'm okay again.

45:08.000 --> 45:09.000
Yes!

45:09.000 --> 45:16.000
Ladies and gentlemen, John Audrey.

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
Brilliant.

45:18.000 --> 45:28.840
John, would you like to stay on stage and help us answer some audience questions?

45:28.840 --> 45:29.840
Yes, please.

45:29.840 --> 45:30.840
Yes.

45:30.840 --> 45:31.840
Is there a chair?

45:31.840 --> 45:32.840
May we have a chair?

45:32.840 --> 45:33.840
Thank you.

45:33.840 --> 45:34.840
Thank you.

45:34.840 --> 45:35.840
Thank you very much.

45:35.840 --> 45:38.200
John, he's going to read some dope shit I read about train.

45:38.200 --> 45:39.200
This guy.

45:39.200 --> 45:41.200
No, I didn't write anything about train.

45:41.200 --> 45:43.240
Seriously, thank you for letting us read that.

45:43.240 --> 45:44.240
Thank you.

45:44.240 --> 45:45.240
Stand up again.

45:45.240 --> 45:46.240
Another big round of applause.

45:46.240 --> 45:47.240
No.

45:47.240 --> 45:48.240
It's so wonderful.

45:48.240 --> 45:49.240
That was so, so, so good.

45:49.240 --> 45:50.240
It was beautifully written.

45:50.240 --> 45:51.240
It makes me so sad.

45:51.240 --> 45:52.240
The funniest thing that's ever happened on our show has nothing to do with us.

45:52.240 --> 45:53.240
Let's say I love you.

45:53.240 --> 45:54.240
This is life.

45:54.240 --> 45:55.240
Hey, thanks for doing that, John.

45:55.240 --> 45:56.240
Oh, it was my pleasure.

45:56.240 --> 45:57.240
We're going to take some audience questions.

45:57.240 --> 46:10.960
And the way this works is this, you raise your hand, you get called on, you come to

46:10.960 --> 46:17.240
the microphone, you ask us, all four of us, my brother, my brother, my brother, and me,

46:17.240 --> 46:20.960
all four, for advice, and we help you.

46:20.960 --> 46:21.960
There is one rule.

46:21.960 --> 46:24.520
What's the one rule, everybody?

46:24.520 --> 46:25.520
No bummers.

46:25.520 --> 46:26.520
That is correct.

46:26.520 --> 46:28.760
So, who has a question that is not a bummer?

46:28.760 --> 46:29.760
Oh, my God.

46:29.760 --> 46:30.760
The pressure is so on.

46:30.760 --> 46:32.200
I saw the gentleman there in the light blue shirt.

46:32.200 --> 46:33.200
Come on up.

46:33.200 --> 46:34.200
Yeah.

46:34.200 --> 46:35.200
The mic is actually behind you.

46:35.200 --> 46:36.200
Yeah.

46:36.200 --> 46:37.200
Yeah.

46:37.200 --> 46:38.200
The gentleman there in the light blue shirt.

46:38.200 --> 46:39.200
While he's walking to the mic, may I just say one thing?

46:39.200 --> 46:40.200
Yes.

46:40.200 --> 46:41.200
Sure.

46:41.200 --> 46:45.640
I was very moved by your description of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito having sex.

46:45.640 --> 46:48.400
The weird thing is that it wasn't, like, romantic.

46:48.400 --> 46:49.600
No.

46:49.600 --> 46:50.600
They were just like...

46:50.600 --> 46:53.040
It was purely of convenience.

46:53.040 --> 46:55.440
They were porking for science.

46:55.440 --> 46:57.120
They were porking for science.

46:57.120 --> 47:02.280
It reminded me that when I was a young person here in New York City, my friends and I had

47:02.280 --> 47:06.400
a would-you-rather game with one specific question.

47:06.400 --> 47:14.720
Would you rather cuddle with Danny DeVito nude every night for the rest of your life...

47:14.720 --> 47:15.720
That one.

47:15.720 --> 47:24.520
...or have Danny DeVito call you every day and have to talk with him for an hour?

47:24.520 --> 47:26.840
They're both really good things.

47:26.840 --> 47:27.840
Yeah.

47:27.840 --> 47:29.320
I mean, they're both good outcomes.

47:29.320 --> 47:31.360
You're the centerpiece of my day.

47:31.360 --> 47:32.360
Don't make me choose.

47:32.360 --> 47:33.360
I know.

47:33.360 --> 47:37.000
And we talked about it for a long time because we couldn't decide.

47:37.000 --> 47:44.400
And I understand you want to ask your question, sir, but I don't care about you.

47:44.400 --> 47:54.000
In the year 2012, I took my family on a vacation to London, England, and we stayed in a hotel.

47:54.000 --> 47:56.640
And I took my children, who were very young at the time.

47:56.640 --> 48:03.760
They're approximately four years older each now, but at the time they were younger, by

48:03.760 --> 48:04.760
roughly eight years.

48:04.760 --> 48:06.760
It was a weird thing.

48:06.760 --> 48:12.700
Anyway, we went up to the pool of this hotel in London, England, and because it was London,

48:12.700 --> 48:15.720
the pool was about the size of a postage stamp.

48:15.720 --> 48:25.120
And we were there, and there was a weird old man there doing exercises.

48:25.120 --> 48:26.120
What do you call these?

48:26.120 --> 48:27.120
Bicep curls?

48:27.120 --> 48:28.120
Bicep curls.

48:28.120 --> 48:29.120
Yes, exactly so.

48:29.120 --> 48:30.120
And it took me a while to realize.

48:30.120 --> 48:31.960
Why was I the one to get that?

48:31.960 --> 48:32.960
You beat me through.

48:32.960 --> 48:33.960
You jumped.

48:33.960 --> 48:38.000
It took me a while to realize that that man was Danny DeVito.

48:38.000 --> 48:39.000
Nice.

48:39.000 --> 48:40.120
Getting some gains.

48:40.120 --> 48:41.560
And I was like, how about that?

48:41.560 --> 48:42.560
There's Danny DeVito.

48:42.560 --> 48:45.520
Well, children, it's time to leave immediately.

48:45.520 --> 48:53.200
And before we could go, Danny DeVito caught my eye, and he said, daily show.

48:53.200 --> 48:57.280
I'm like, oh, Jesus, kids.

48:57.280 --> 49:03.120
You were physically putting yourself between them and Danny DeVito.

49:03.120 --> 49:08.280
And I went over, and I'm like, hello, Danny DeVito, who, by the way, is a hero of mine.

49:08.280 --> 49:12.300
But Danny DeVito, all I wanted to do is take my kids back to the room so we could get on

49:12.300 --> 49:13.300
with the day.

49:13.300 --> 49:16.960
And Danny DeVito just started talking and talking and talking about his love for the

49:16.960 --> 49:18.160
daily show.

49:18.160 --> 49:20.520
And then he took his shirt off.

49:20.520 --> 49:21.520
Nice.

49:21.520 --> 49:22.520
To go swimming.

49:22.520 --> 49:24.120
To show you his John Stewart tattoo.

49:24.120 --> 49:25.120
No, no, no.

49:25.120 --> 49:31.160
He was just going to go swimming, and it was this profound, weird moment where I realized

49:31.160 --> 49:40.280
both versions of my dream are coming true.

49:40.280 --> 49:41.280
And with that, your question.

49:41.280 --> 49:42.280
Your question.

49:42.280 --> 49:43.280
I hadn't thought about that.

49:43.280 --> 49:44.280
It was a wonderful life you've led.

49:44.280 --> 49:45.280
Also, I love you, Danny DeVito.

49:45.280 --> 49:46.280
All right, go on.

49:46.280 --> 49:48.840
If you're listening, please, you're welcome any time.

49:48.840 --> 49:52.000
I'll cuddle with you or talk to you every day for the rest of my life.

49:52.000 --> 49:55.040
What if this guy, like, what's your name, and this guy's like, my name's Steve DeVito,

49:55.040 --> 49:56.040
and I'm not entertained.

49:56.040 --> 49:58.680
Could be.

49:58.680 --> 49:59.680
What is your real name?

49:59.680 --> 50:00.680
My name's Tim.

50:00.680 --> 50:01.680
What?

50:01.680 --> 50:02.680
Tim.

50:02.680 --> 50:03.680
Tim.

50:03.680 --> 50:04.680
Tim.

50:04.680 --> 50:05.680
Just a disclaimer, you've got to eat that mic.

50:05.680 --> 50:06.680
Yeah.

50:06.680 --> 50:07.680
The sound just disappears.

50:07.680 --> 50:08.680
Levels?

50:08.680 --> 50:09.680
Levels.

50:09.680 --> 50:10.680
You're great.

50:10.680 --> 50:11.680
We're going to shut up and let you talk, too.

50:11.680 --> 50:12.680
It's just a dead room, they told us.

50:12.680 --> 50:13.680
I should be teaching a first aid course.

50:13.680 --> 50:14.680
One more question, Danny DeVito.

50:14.680 --> 50:15.680
Yes.

50:15.680 --> 50:16.680
Yes.

50:16.680 --> 50:17.680
Sorry.

50:17.680 --> 50:18.680
Go ahead.

50:18.680 --> 50:22.600
So I should be teaching a first aid course this weekend, but when I saw the opportunity

50:22.600 --> 50:26.800
to come see you guys live, my best friend stepped in and said he would teach the course

50:26.800 --> 50:33.020
for me, and how do I pay someone back for a treat like this, and I don't count John because

50:33.020 --> 50:34.560
you weren't part of the original deal.

50:34.560 --> 50:35.560
Fair.

50:35.560 --> 50:37.120
No, he's only sweetened it.

50:37.120 --> 50:38.120
Amazing.

50:38.120 --> 50:40.560
I was going to get him an Xbox, but in light of recent events-

50:40.560 --> 50:41.560
No, fuck it.

50:41.560 --> 50:42.560
Are you kidding me?

50:42.560 --> 50:43.560
Xbox.

50:43.560 --> 50:44.560
Xbox.

50:44.560 --> 50:45.560
Xbox.

50:45.560 --> 50:46.560
Not so much.

50:46.560 --> 50:47.560
So I just don't know if you have any ideas.

50:47.560 --> 50:48.560
Commencer it for the amount of appointments.

50:48.560 --> 50:49.560
Have you thought about a PlayStation 4?

50:49.560 --> 50:50.560
Yeah.

50:50.560 --> 50:51.560
It's a good one.

50:51.560 --> 50:52.560
It's a solid get.

50:52.560 --> 50:53.560
Have you considered a subscription to CISO?

50:53.560 --> 50:54.560
What was the-

50:54.560 --> 50:56.560
There's a lot of great programming on CISO.

50:56.560 --> 50:57.560
Beautiful.

50:57.560 --> 50:58.560
All good.

50:58.560 --> 50:59.560
What was the course you were going to take?

50:59.560 --> 51:01.040
I was going to teach a first aid course.

51:01.040 --> 51:02.440
You were going to teach a first aid course.

51:02.440 --> 51:04.440
Is your friend qualified to do this?

51:04.440 --> 51:05.440
Super not.

51:05.440 --> 51:06.440
All right, here's the thing.

51:06.440 --> 51:07.800
The heartbeat is super important.

51:07.800 --> 51:10.760
You got to keep a bunch of blood in there all at once.

51:10.760 --> 51:12.960
If you see blood outside, bummer.

51:12.960 --> 51:13.960
That's bad.

51:13.960 --> 51:14.960
That's bad.

51:14.960 --> 51:15.960
That's bad.

51:15.960 --> 51:16.960
That's bad.

51:16.960 --> 51:17.960
Okay.

51:17.960 --> 51:18.960
Were you going to be paid to teach this course?

51:18.960 --> 51:19.960
No.

51:19.960 --> 51:20.960
Volunteer.

51:20.960 --> 51:21.960
Then you should have just not done it.

51:21.960 --> 51:22.960
He's giving up a weekend.

51:22.960 --> 51:23.960
Just don't come.

51:23.960 --> 51:24.960
Just don't go.

51:24.960 --> 51:27.560
Just don't arrive at the time you're supposed to.

51:27.560 --> 51:29.560
But now I'm on audio and they know I'm here.

51:29.560 --> 51:30.560
What are they going to do?

51:30.560 --> 51:31.560
Not pay you?

51:31.560 --> 51:32.560
Well, you're fine.

51:32.560 --> 51:34.320
Just don't go.

51:34.320 --> 51:37.180
So I figured I'd say thank you on the mic to him because I'm going to play this episode

51:37.180 --> 51:38.180
for him to say thank you.

51:38.180 --> 51:39.180
Oh, so you're just fucking losing yourself.

51:39.180 --> 51:40.180
We're going to edit this out.

51:40.180 --> 51:42.320
We're going to edit this out, Tim.

51:42.320 --> 51:43.320
No free ride.

51:43.320 --> 51:44.320
It's a fun arrangement.

51:44.320 --> 51:46.400
You got to buy a Jumbotron.

51:46.400 --> 51:49.920
By the way, if any of you are thinking about going to that Saturday night volunteer first

51:49.920 --> 51:54.240
aid course, I would say don't bother.

51:54.240 --> 51:55.520
The party courts they call it.

51:55.520 --> 51:56.520
Let's do this.

51:56.520 --> 51:57.520
Let's do this.

51:57.520 --> 51:58.520
How many people are going to be at the first aid course?

51:58.520 --> 51:59.520
How many people?

51:59.520 --> 52:00.520
About 40.

52:00.520 --> 52:01.520
40.

52:01.520 --> 52:02.520
Jesus.

52:02.520 --> 52:03.520
That's a lot.

52:03.520 --> 52:04.520
This bit may not work then.

52:04.520 --> 52:05.520
I was going to say just give...

52:05.520 --> 52:06.520
There's like a thousand people here.

52:06.520 --> 52:10.360
Just give them like a little nug, like a little first aid nug, like the first like most important

52:10.360 --> 52:11.360
like keep the blood inside.

52:11.360 --> 52:12.360
Right now.

52:12.360 --> 52:13.360
So no bleeding.

52:13.360 --> 52:14.360
Right.

52:14.360 --> 52:15.360
It better not be a joke.

52:15.360 --> 52:16.360
I want to learn something.

52:16.360 --> 52:17.360
First, don't bleed.

52:17.360 --> 52:18.360
Don't bleed?

52:18.360 --> 52:19.360
Right.

52:19.360 --> 52:20.360
Okay.

52:20.360 --> 52:21.360
But if they're already doing that, then like...

52:21.360 --> 52:22.360
Oh, then stop it.

52:22.360 --> 52:23.360
Stop it.

52:23.360 --> 52:24.360
All right.

52:24.360 --> 52:25.360
There we go.

52:25.360 --> 52:26.360
Great.

52:26.360 --> 52:27.360
Tim, everybody.

52:27.360 --> 52:28.360
Tim.

52:28.360 --> 52:29.360
All right.

52:29.360 --> 52:30.360
Who's next?

52:30.360 --> 52:31.360
I see this hand.

52:31.360 --> 52:32.360
I saw this hand go really fast front row.

52:32.360 --> 52:33.360
Come on down.

52:33.360 --> 52:34.360
You did it.

52:34.360 --> 52:35.360
You did it.

52:35.360 --> 52:36.360
Come on down.

52:36.360 --> 52:37.360
Okay.

52:37.360 --> 52:38.360
My name is Allison.

52:38.360 --> 52:39.360
Hi, Allison.

52:39.360 --> 52:40.360
Hi, Allison.

52:40.360 --> 52:41.360
So John, I have to tell you, I have a really good friend who used to work at The Daily

52:41.360 --> 52:42.360
Show.

52:42.360 --> 52:43.360
Come on.

52:43.360 --> 52:44.360
It's our show.

52:44.360 --> 52:45.360
I'm sorry.

52:45.360 --> 52:46.360
I'm sorry.

52:46.360 --> 52:47.360
Come on.

52:47.360 --> 52:48.360
Do you...

52:48.360 --> 52:49.360
John.

52:49.360 --> 52:50.360
Hi, Allison.

52:50.360 --> 52:51.360
How are you?

52:51.360 --> 52:52.360
I'm fine back here.

52:52.360 --> 52:53.360
I'm going to tweet more about my TV show.

52:53.360 --> 52:55.360
John, do you know my friend Jocelyn who used to work at The Daily Show?

52:55.360 --> 52:56.360
Sure.

52:56.360 --> 52:57.360
Of course I know Jocelyn.

52:57.360 --> 52:58.360
Yeah, we're good friends.

52:58.360 --> 52:59.360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

52:59.360 --> 53:00.360
Oh, fantastic.

53:00.360 --> 53:01.360
I hate Jocelyn.

53:01.360 --> 53:02.360
Yeah, she stinks.

53:02.360 --> 53:03.360
Boo.

53:03.360 --> 53:04.360
Jocelyn is made of farts.

53:04.360 --> 53:05.360
Let me tell you.

53:05.360 --> 53:07.640
We're all making a big mistake because she's a lovely woman.

53:07.640 --> 53:08.640
I bet.

53:08.640 --> 53:09.640
Made of farts.

53:09.640 --> 53:10.640
She is.

53:10.640 --> 53:12.880
And my whole point is that you were very nice to me.

53:12.880 --> 53:13.880
I met you before once.

53:13.880 --> 53:14.880
You probably don't remember, but it was...

53:14.880 --> 53:15.880
I don't.

53:15.880 --> 53:16.880
It was great.

53:16.880 --> 53:19.280
It was great for me.

53:19.280 --> 53:20.280
Were you with Jocelyn?

53:20.280 --> 53:21.280
Yeah, I was.

53:21.280 --> 53:22.280
Yeah, I still don't remember.

53:22.280 --> 53:26.640
I bet you're regretting not pointing your question at us, huh?

53:26.640 --> 53:28.120
We would have remembered you.

53:28.120 --> 53:30.360
But anyway, nice to see you again.

53:30.360 --> 53:32.080
Oh, it's great to see you as well.

53:32.080 --> 53:33.080
My question...

53:33.080 --> 53:38.580
Is there something for our desk that we have here?

53:38.580 --> 53:39.760
We have an inbox.

53:39.760 --> 53:40.760
It's empty.

53:40.760 --> 53:42.080
We have an outbox for trash.

53:42.080 --> 53:43.800
I think she's transitioning to the question.

53:43.800 --> 53:44.800
I am.

53:44.800 --> 53:45.800
I am indeed.

53:45.800 --> 53:52.840
So my question is, I was introduced to my Bim Bam about a year ago by a guy, and I'm

53:52.840 --> 53:55.440
about to turn 31.

53:55.440 --> 53:56.440
And it's fine.

53:56.440 --> 53:57.640
It didn't work out, but it was cool.

53:57.640 --> 53:59.520
I'm totally mature and whatever.

53:59.520 --> 54:00.520
It's fine.

54:00.520 --> 54:10.840
Mature people usually do say stuff like that, so whatever.

54:10.840 --> 54:13.200
But I'm totally great and successful and whatever.

54:13.200 --> 54:14.200
It's fine.

54:14.200 --> 54:15.200
My life is great.

54:15.200 --> 54:16.200
I'm doing great.

54:16.200 --> 54:17.200
It's fucking sick.

54:17.200 --> 54:18.200
Yeah.

54:18.200 --> 54:19.200
You're doing great.

54:19.200 --> 54:22.200
Hey, can I ask you some advice questions?

54:22.200 --> 54:29.480
But I introduced one of my really very good friends from college to my Bim Bam, and he

54:29.480 --> 54:30.480
loves it.

54:30.480 --> 54:36.360
However, his wife, who also happens to be one of my best friends, is not as interested.

54:36.360 --> 54:37.360
Cool.

54:37.360 --> 54:38.360
By the way, this is quite an emotional journey.

54:38.360 --> 54:39.360
I agree.

54:39.360 --> 54:41.800
Yeah, this is like, I'm going to need a flow chart.

54:41.800 --> 54:44.600
So some people like us, some people don't, and you're doing great.

54:44.600 --> 54:45.600
Yeah.

54:45.600 --> 54:54.120
So honest, we're like 50-50, you're 100% rad, and also you have a friend who knows John.

54:54.120 --> 54:55.120
Yeah.

54:55.120 --> 54:56.120
I have picked up all the details.

54:56.120 --> 54:59.080
The key to writing a fantasy novel is world building.

54:59.080 --> 55:07.800
Sorry, did you say your name was Griffin McElroy's Twitter mentions?

55:07.800 --> 55:14.240
No, but for real, are you asking us like how to get your friend on board with our brand

55:14.240 --> 55:15.240
of comedy?

55:15.240 --> 55:19.080
Yeah, because there's two of us now, and we have good taste, and we're strong, and we

55:19.080 --> 55:24.120
believe in ourselves, but this one other person outlier is not into it.

55:24.120 --> 55:25.920
How do we convince?

55:25.920 --> 55:26.920
Who is the person?

55:26.920 --> 55:27.920
I'm confused.

55:27.920 --> 55:28.920
Who's the person?

55:28.920 --> 55:29.920
No one.

55:29.920 --> 55:30.920
It's not Jocelyn.

55:30.920 --> 55:31.920
It's no one you know.

55:31.920 --> 55:32.920
No, no, no.

55:32.920 --> 55:33.920
Everyone loves you, John.

55:33.920 --> 55:34.920
Don't worry.

55:34.920 --> 55:35.920
Yeah, don't worry.

55:35.920 --> 55:36.920
So this is your friend's wife.

55:36.920 --> 55:40.720
Yeah, who happens to be also my very good friend.

55:40.720 --> 55:41.720
Like do they try?

55:41.720 --> 55:42.720
They don't try.

55:42.720 --> 55:43.720
Are they unaware?

55:43.720 --> 55:44.720
Are they trying?

55:44.720 --> 55:45.720
They're like, eh, eh.

55:45.720 --> 55:46.720
Do they know we have a TV show now?

55:46.720 --> 55:47.720
Yeah.

55:47.720 --> 55:48.720
We're like multimedia.

55:48.720 --> 55:49.720
Maybe they'll prefer like a visual medium.

55:49.720 --> 55:50.720
To be fair.

55:50.720 --> 55:51.720
Probably not.

55:51.720 --> 55:52.720
To be fair.

55:52.720 --> 55:53.720
I've tried.

55:53.720 --> 55:56.720
I've tried, but her husband like walks around the house like laughing to himself, which

55:56.720 --> 55:57.720
is not very cool.

55:57.720 --> 55:58.720
No, that's not it.

55:58.720 --> 55:59.720
No, no, no.

55:59.720 --> 56:00.720
That's not really how you sell anything.

56:00.720 --> 56:01.720
What are you laughing at?

56:01.720 --> 56:02.720
No, you can't hear it.

56:02.720 --> 56:03.720
Be quiet.

56:03.720 --> 56:11.720
Listen, I've spent a lot of time with baby Charlie over the last two days.

56:11.720 --> 56:15.200
To get someone interested in something, you have to be withholding of it.

56:15.200 --> 56:18.120
So what has to happen is your friend has to laugh at it, and when she's like, what is

56:18.120 --> 56:19.120
it like?

56:19.120 --> 56:20.120
It's not for you.

56:20.120 --> 56:21.120
No, no, no.

56:21.120 --> 56:22.120
It's only for cool, mature people.

56:22.120 --> 56:23.920
This is just for cool, mature people who are doing great financially.

56:23.920 --> 56:26.920
It's not for you babies.

56:26.920 --> 56:28.920
Babies wouldn't appreciate our show.

56:28.920 --> 56:29.920
It's a grown-up podcast.

56:29.920 --> 56:32.920
You do that enough, and pretty soon you'll catch her listening to it.

56:32.920 --> 56:34.920
I'm like, I had to find out what all the fuss was about.

56:34.920 --> 56:35.920
I'm like, welcome.

56:35.920 --> 56:36.920
Yeah, welcome to the family.

56:36.920 --> 56:37.920
Come with me.

56:37.920 --> 56:38.920
Do they live in the area?

56:38.920 --> 56:39.920
Yeah, we all live in New York.

56:39.920 --> 56:40.920
Is she here?

56:40.920 --> 56:41.920
No, she's not.

56:41.920 --> 56:42.920
I had to take it.

56:42.920 --> 56:43.920
That would have been a great onboard though.

56:43.920 --> 56:48.480
If they live in the area, it's probably pretty good they didn't get into the show, because

56:48.480 --> 56:49.480
we ain't got no more seats.

56:49.480 --> 56:50.480
What's up?

56:50.480 --> 57:00.160
I've had a TV show for 30 minutes, and I fucking lost it.

57:00.160 --> 57:02.640
I'm an insane person.

57:02.640 --> 57:04.080
Is her husband here?

57:04.080 --> 57:06.400
Hey, you did great.

57:06.400 --> 57:07.400
You guys are together.

57:07.400 --> 57:08.400
Oh, that's fantastic.

57:08.400 --> 57:09.400
Okay.

57:09.400 --> 57:10.400
Here's a solution.

57:10.400 --> 57:11.400
You leave your wife.

57:11.400 --> 57:12.400
Jesus.

57:12.400 --> 57:13.400
Oh, no.

57:13.400 --> 57:14.400
John, John.

57:14.400 --> 57:15.400
Wait, wait, wait.

57:15.400 --> 57:16.400
No, no, hold on.

57:16.400 --> 57:17.400
John, John, John, John, John, John, John.

57:17.400 --> 57:23.080
And you guys- John, John, John, John, it's your first time here.

57:23.080 --> 57:25.120
Justin's literally covering his ears like a child would do.

57:25.120 --> 57:26.120
John, John, no.

57:26.120 --> 57:27.120
Not about John.

57:27.120 --> 57:28.120
No.

57:28.120 --> 57:29.120
We have samplers on YouTube.

57:29.120 --> 57:31.320
There are easier ways to go about this.

57:31.320 --> 57:33.680
Please try our samplers on YouTube.

57:33.680 --> 57:35.240
Please.

57:35.240 --> 57:36.240
Maybe get her a t-shirt.

57:36.240 --> 57:37.240
They're great.

57:37.240 --> 57:39.800
You guys know this is where this is going.

57:39.800 --> 57:40.800
Just go.

57:40.800 --> 57:41.800
It wasn't.

57:41.800 --> 57:42.800
It wasn't.

57:42.800 --> 57:43.800
It wasn't.

57:43.800 --> 57:47.680
Justin is shipping our audience who are doing her best up here.

57:47.680 --> 57:48.680
Who's next?

57:48.680 --> 57:49.680
Let's get someone from over there.

57:49.680 --> 57:51.680
I see somebody in a white jacket over there.

57:51.680 --> 57:52.680
Yes, you're waving your hand.

57:52.680 --> 57:53.680
Yes, yes, yes.

57:53.680 --> 57:54.680
The one who applauded.

57:54.680 --> 57:55.680
Come on down.

57:55.680 --> 57:56.680
The one who applauded when we picked you.

57:56.680 --> 57:57.680
That's wonderful.

57:57.680 --> 57:58.680
Hi.

57:58.680 --> 57:59.680
What's your name?

57:59.680 --> 58:00.680
Hi.

58:00.680 --> 58:01.680
My name is Dani.

58:01.680 --> 58:02.680
Hi, Dani.

58:02.680 --> 58:03.680
Hi, Dani.

58:03.680 --> 58:04.680
First of all, I'm wearing a Kung Fu Panda 3.

58:04.680 --> 58:05.680
Fuck yeah.

58:05.680 --> 58:06.680
Yeah.

58:06.680 --> 58:07.680
Have you seen it?

58:07.680 --> 58:08.680
It's so good, dude.

58:08.680 --> 58:13.280
I was interning at DreamWorks when that episode came out.

58:13.280 --> 58:14.880
Holy shit.

58:14.880 --> 58:15.880
They must have been...

58:15.880 --> 58:16.880
And you played it for Jim DreamWorks?

58:16.880 --> 58:19.880
They must have been so excited to hear us buzzing.

58:19.880 --> 58:21.880
I almost got fired.

58:21.880 --> 58:22.880
No.

58:22.880 --> 58:29.560
So my question is, I have had a childhood friend since we were in second grade.

58:29.560 --> 58:33.840
Unfortunately, it has kind of turned into a hate kind of thing.

58:33.840 --> 58:34.840
Okay.

58:34.840 --> 58:35.840
Cool.

58:35.840 --> 58:37.640
But this is a long journey, but...

58:37.640 --> 58:42.280
You're on the razor's edge of Bummer County.

58:42.280 --> 58:43.280
No, no, no.

58:43.280 --> 58:44.280
No, no, no.

58:44.280 --> 58:45.280
No.

58:45.280 --> 58:46.280
I got this.

58:46.280 --> 58:47.280
Okay.

58:47.280 --> 58:48.280
But I really love his mom.

58:48.280 --> 58:57.640
She's like a second mom to me, and she is trying to pay me to tutor his little brother.

58:57.640 --> 58:58.640
Layer upon layer.

58:58.640 --> 58:59.640
This is an onion, Dani.

58:59.640 --> 59:00.640
Go on.

59:00.640 --> 59:08.040
So what I'm trying to figure out is how do I avoid that guy while getting paid?

59:08.040 --> 59:09.040
You don't.

59:09.040 --> 59:11.040
You rub it right in his face.

59:11.040 --> 59:12.520
You are getting paid to be in his house.

59:12.520 --> 59:16.320
He is there for free.

59:16.320 --> 59:21.560
You are the grim specter that haunts him for all his days.

59:21.560 --> 59:22.560
What's...

59:22.560 --> 59:24.200
I shouldn't ask what the friend's name is.

59:24.200 --> 59:25.680
That's probably a little too personal.

59:25.680 --> 59:31.480
Let's just call him Chad, and he'll be like, hey, Chad, you got any little debbies like

59:31.480 --> 59:32.480
you usually have?

59:32.480 --> 59:34.280
I guess your mom doesn't have money for that anymore.

59:34.280 --> 59:35.280
Wonder where it went.

59:35.280 --> 59:38.280
Flip, flip, flip, flip, flip, flip, flip, flip, flip, flip, flip, flip, flip, flip, flip,

59:38.280 --> 59:39.280
flip, flip, flip.

59:39.280 --> 59:40.280
Your brother can do math now.

59:40.280 --> 59:41.280
You Chad, I'm out.

59:41.280 --> 59:42.280
Thank you.

59:42.280 --> 59:43.280
You're welcome.

59:43.280 --> 59:44.280
Oh, that's it.

59:44.280 --> 59:45.280
Oh, we did it.

59:45.280 --> 59:46.280
Cool.

59:46.280 --> 59:47.280
Yep.

59:47.280 --> 59:48.280
Fucking fixed it.

59:48.280 --> 59:49.280
Got it in one.

59:49.280 --> 59:50.280
Wait.

59:50.280 --> 59:51.280
You pick.

59:51.280 --> 59:52.280
Right here in the middle, because we never do in the middle.

59:52.280 --> 59:53.280
Right here with the pink hair.

59:53.280 --> 59:54.280
Yes.

59:54.280 --> 59:55.280
Yes.

59:55.280 --> 59:56.280
You got it.

59:56.280 --> 59:57.280
Here with the cool hair.

59:57.280 --> 59:58.280
Come on.

59:58.280 --> 01:00:05.680
I feel like you didn't get a hand on that ball, the Tudor ball.

01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:06.680
You okay with that?

01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:07.680
I'm just fine.

01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:08.680
Okay.

01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:09.680
Hey.

01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:10.680
Hi.

01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:11.680
What's your name?

01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:12.680
I'm Jessica.

01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:13.680
Hi, Jessica.

01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:14.680
I'm Justin.

01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:18.680
So I discovered Maximum Fun while I was pregnant with my second child.

01:00:18.680 --> 01:00:19.680
Really?

01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:20.680
Named Moxie.

01:00:20.680 --> 01:00:21.680
That's cool.

01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:22.680
That's cool.

01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:23.680
We're now-

01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:26.920
I saw a few people nodding approvingly.

01:00:26.920 --> 01:00:30.480
I think the ship has sailed.

01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:32.360
Did Moxie sponsor your child?

01:00:32.360 --> 01:00:35.040
Because they didn't sponsor my goddamn podcast.

01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:37.440
Moxie did sponsor your podcast.

01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:38.440
Oh, no, no.

01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:39.440
Don't.

01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:40.440
Don't.

01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:41.440
Go on with your question.

01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:42.440
Yeah.

01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:43.440
We sent you some money.

01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:44.440
So how can we help you?

01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:47.400
Or did you just want to talk to John like you're crazy?

01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:50.960
So John helped name my second child.

01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:51.960
Okay.

01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:52.960
So the second one-

01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:54.520
I need you guys to help name my third child.

01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:56.520
Hell yeah.

01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:58.240
Have you considered-

01:00:58.240 --> 01:01:00.320
It has to start with an M.

01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:01.320
M?

01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:02.320
Okay.

01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:07.320
How about extreme restraints?

01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:16.200
What about just mmm and you call them mmm for short?

01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:17.200
What about Mbembe?

01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:18.200
Yeah.

01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:23.200
Yeah, you really set us up easy for that one.

01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:24.200
McElroy.

01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:25.200
What McElroy?

01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:26.200
McElroy's such a good name.

01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:28.240
I figured you guys would have enough M names to suggest.

01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:29.240
Macklemore.

01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:30.800
Shit no.

01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:32.960
Have you-

01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:43.840
I've never met a person with the name money, but I kind of love it.

01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:45.000
I'm money.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:46.000
You know me.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:47.000
You know my style.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:48.000
You know me.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.000
I'm money.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:50.000
Are you quoting swingers?

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.000
No.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:58.200
Here's my driver's license.

01:01:58.200 --> 01:02:00.000
I'm 115 years old.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
I'm Benjamin Buttoning out.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:08.920
Have you thought about Mark, but said with like a fun way, like Merck?

01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:13.360
Like if somebody's having fun with a guy named Mark, they're not just going to say, hey Mark.

01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:14.360
Never.

01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:15.360
Hey Mark.

01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:17.680
I would have to say that's a winner, but we already used that one.

01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:18.680
Son of a bitch.

01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:19.680
What about Mark all caps?

01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:23.680
So it's like this is Mark and this is brother Mark.

01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:24.680
Wait a minute.

01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:27.920
This is for your third child.

01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:28.920
Number one is Mark.

01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:29.920
Yeah.

01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:30.920
Number two is Moxie.

01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:31.920
Yeah.

01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:37.280
You have to stop that.

01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:39.520
Might I suggest these are, these are human beings.

01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:50.240
You understand that they're not your craft project.

01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:52.480
Come up with something else.

01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:57.960
You can maybe combine the two older boys names and call him Marks.

01:02:57.960 --> 01:02:58.960
Yeah.

01:02:58.960 --> 01:02:59.960
That's good.

01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:00.960
Marksy for short.

01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:01.960
Or mock.

01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:02.960
I am mock.

01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:03.960
I'm excited for school.

01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:04.960
Thank you for the PB&J mother.

01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:05.960
Mock desires applesauce.

01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:06.960
You will bring mock applesauce.

01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:07.960
You are mother.

01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:08.960
Do as I say.

01:03:08.960 --> 01:03:09.960
You do as mock.

01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:10.960
All are become mock.

01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:11.960
Hey Modoc at some point.

01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:12.960
Hey Modoc.

01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:13.960
Hey.

01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:14.960
Hey.

01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:15.960
Hey.

01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:16.960
Hey.

01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:17.960
Hey.

01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:18.960
Hey.

01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:19.960
Hey.

01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:20.960
Hey.

01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:21.960
Hey.

01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:22.960
Hey.

01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:23.960
Hey.

01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:24.960
Hey.

01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:25.960
Hey.

01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:26.960
Hey.

01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:27.960
Hey.

01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:28.960
Hey.

01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:29.960
Hey.

01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:30.960
Hey.

01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:31.960
Hey.

01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:32.960
Hey.

01:03:32.960 --> 01:03:33.960
Hey.

01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:34.960
Hey.

01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:35.960
Modoc is very good too.

01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:36.960
What about, hey.

01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:37.960
Hello for babies.

01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:40.900
Kill those were the real gay much play brought to you by play station.

01:03:40.900 --> 01:03:43.160
I hope that answers your question.

01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:44.160
Wait, wait.

01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:46.960
You have to decide.

01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:51.080
Well, Mr. Mr.

01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:57.120
Manzy, but taken Maraites Mandy.

01:03:57.120 --> 01:03:58.380
Mattington.

01:03:58.380 --> 01:03:59.820
I like Manzi a lot better.

01:03:59.820 --> 01:04:01.020
Mustin.

01:04:01.020 --> 01:04:02.540
Mustin McElroy.

01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:04.800
Mavis.

01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:05.860
Mustard Gas.

01:04:05.860 --> 01:04:06.700
Mustard.

01:04:06.700 --> 01:04:08.620
I didn't know what I was getting into when I asked.

01:04:08.620 --> 01:04:10.180
Yeah, you're just getting into a fucking free association.

01:04:10.180 --> 01:04:11.860
You guys literally aren't here right now.

01:04:11.860 --> 01:04:13.180
We're just doing a free association.

01:04:13.180 --> 01:04:14.980
We gave up on words that start with M

01:04:14.980 --> 01:04:16.780
and we're adding the M to other words.

01:04:16.780 --> 01:04:19.220
That's a bad job, huh?

01:04:19.220 --> 01:04:20.380
That's not even humor.

01:04:20.380 --> 01:04:21.900
And now you see my problem.

01:04:21.900 --> 01:04:23.460
My words, my words.

01:04:23.460 --> 01:04:25.340
Just love, love large numbers.

01:04:25.340 --> 01:04:27.220
I think the name was in there somewhere.

01:04:27.220 --> 01:04:28.060
Somewhere. Thank you guys.

01:04:28.060 --> 01:04:28.900
Glad we could help.

01:04:28.900 --> 01:04:29.740
Thank you.

01:04:29.740 --> 01:04:30.560
Let's do one more.

01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:31.400
One more?

01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:32.240
Yeah.

01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:33.060
Right there.

01:04:33.060 --> 01:04:33.900
Yes.

01:04:33.900 --> 01:04:34.740
Red shirt.

01:04:34.740 --> 01:04:35.560
Red shirt.

01:04:35.560 --> 01:04:36.400
Yes, yes, yes.

01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:38.100
Right under, under shirt.

01:04:38.100 --> 01:04:39.020
It says Goosebumps.

01:04:39.020 --> 01:04:40.180
It's clearly a Goosebumps shirt.

01:04:40.180 --> 01:04:41.180
It is a Goosebumps shirt.

01:04:41.180 --> 01:04:42.020
That's so rad.

01:04:42.020 --> 01:04:42.860
Excellent.

01:04:42.860 --> 01:04:43.700
Which one is that?

01:04:43.700 --> 01:04:45.940
It's Night of the Living Dummy.

01:04:45.940 --> 01:04:49.620
I actually, I used my alcohol money on this shirt.

01:04:49.620 --> 01:04:50.460
Because I.

01:04:50.460 --> 01:04:53.740
You are going to be fantastic.

01:04:53.740 --> 01:04:54.940
Yeah.

01:04:54.940 --> 01:04:56.340
Yeah.

01:04:56.340 --> 01:04:57.860
I'm going to say you don't drink enough.

01:04:57.860 --> 01:04:59.100
Yeah.

01:04:59.100 --> 01:05:00.900
So to answer your question, yes, I budget.

01:05:00.900 --> 01:05:03.460
And yes, I'm great at it.

01:05:03.460 --> 01:05:05.020
I have vodka in my freezer.

01:05:05.020 --> 01:05:06.580
I couldn't bring that with me.

01:05:06.580 --> 01:05:07.460
You could have.

01:05:07.460 --> 01:05:08.980
I have to confess a sin.

01:05:08.980 --> 01:05:10.220
Oh shit.

01:05:10.220 --> 01:05:11.140
I murdered.

01:05:11.140 --> 01:05:13.460
Not to, I murder a bunch.

01:05:13.460 --> 01:05:14.300
No.

01:05:14.300 --> 01:05:15.120
You know murder?

01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:16.580
I bought an Xbox.

01:05:16.580 --> 01:05:18.620
Oh, that's a great name for your baby.

01:05:18.620 --> 01:05:19.440
Murder.

01:05:20.780 --> 01:05:21.620
Yeah.

01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:25.040
Okay.

01:05:25.040 --> 01:05:25.860
What did you do?

01:05:25.860 --> 01:05:26.700
What did you do?

01:05:26.700 --> 01:05:30.020
So last year I made my friend listen to all of the Haunted

01:05:30.020 --> 01:05:31.260
Doll Watch segments.

01:05:31.260 --> 01:05:32.100
Okay.

01:05:32.100 --> 01:05:32.940
Sure.

01:05:32.940 --> 01:05:34.820
And she got really into it and started selling dolls

01:05:34.820 --> 01:05:35.660
on eBay.

01:05:37.300 --> 01:05:38.140
Hold on.

01:05:38.140 --> 01:05:39.460
It's becoming Ouroboros.

01:05:39.460 --> 01:05:40.820
It's a snake in its own tail.

01:05:40.820 --> 01:05:44.260
One day we might do a Haunted Doll Watch of your friend's

01:05:44.260 --> 01:05:46.460
Haunted Dolls that we learned about from Haunted Dolls.

01:05:46.460 --> 01:05:47.300
Let her finish because I'm worried.

01:05:47.300 --> 01:05:52.220
See that's the thing is that she hired me to write a couple

01:05:52.220 --> 01:05:53.540
of doll stories.

01:05:53.540 --> 01:05:55.060
You traitor.

01:05:55.060 --> 01:05:59.180
You wrote Haunted Doll stories for eBay?

01:05:59.180 --> 01:06:00.020
She paid me.

01:06:00.020 --> 01:06:00.860
Wait.

01:06:00.860 --> 01:06:01.700
Hold on, hold on.

01:06:01.700 --> 01:06:02.520
Oh shit.

01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:03.780
I'm all about that dollar.

01:06:03.780 --> 01:06:07.260
One of them actually sold and she paid me 25% which amounted

01:06:07.260 --> 01:06:09.900
to $8 consisting of a pair of socks.

01:06:09.900 --> 01:06:11.660
Fuck yeah, dude.

01:06:11.660 --> 01:06:13.780
Kind of a garment based economy.

01:06:13.780 --> 01:06:14.620
Yeah.

01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:16.680
It's kind of the barter system.

01:06:16.680 --> 01:06:19.020
So I just, I needed to confess that I did technically.

01:06:19.020 --> 01:06:19.860
I prodded you.

01:06:19.860 --> 01:06:20.700
Yeah, you're fine.

01:06:20.700 --> 01:06:21.660
I technically prod.

01:06:21.660 --> 01:06:22.480
You're exonerated.

01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:23.320
I still have those socks.

01:06:23.320 --> 01:06:24.160
They're really, really good.

01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:25.000
Nice.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.100
Guys, two Hawaiian shirts.

01:06:27.100 --> 01:06:28.100
That's the trade.

01:06:28.100 --> 01:06:28.940
And we'll fight over.

01:06:28.940 --> 01:06:29.760
I wish.

01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:30.980
Hawaiian shirts are expensive.

01:06:30.980 --> 01:06:31.800
I know.

01:06:33.980 --> 01:06:35.100
For sure.

01:06:35.100 --> 01:06:35.940
No.

01:06:35.940 --> 01:06:37.140
Thank you all so much for coming.

01:06:37.140 --> 01:06:41.020
Thank you, John, for all of the hard work that you've done.

01:06:42.420 --> 01:06:44.420
A big thank you to the PlayStation Theater.

01:06:44.420 --> 01:06:45.260
Yeah, seriously.

01:06:45.260 --> 01:06:46.100
Fuck Xbox.

01:06:46.100 --> 01:06:46.920
Fuck Xbox.

01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:47.760
Fuck Xbox for real.

01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:49.300
Blink's the time sweeper.

01:06:49.300 --> 01:06:50.700
I can't even say your name.

01:06:50.700 --> 01:06:51.820
Good sequel you did.

01:06:51.820 --> 01:06:53.060
Oh wait, did he do a sequel?

01:06:53.060 --> 01:06:53.900
He did.

01:06:53.900 --> 01:06:54.720
He did one sequel.

01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:55.980
Nerd sequel you did.

01:06:55.980 --> 01:06:56.820
Nerd trap.

01:06:56.820 --> 01:06:57.640
You all fell into it.

01:06:57.640 --> 01:06:58.480
Yeah, you all fell directly into it.

01:06:58.480 --> 01:07:00.060
Thank you to Still Buffering.

01:07:00.060 --> 01:07:00.900
Yeah.

01:07:00.900 --> 01:07:01.740
New to Groundwalk.

01:07:01.740 --> 01:07:04.240
A big thank you to Sawbones.

01:07:06.980 --> 01:07:07.820
Hey.

01:07:07.820 --> 01:07:08.640
For real?

01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:09.480
Thank you to CISO for real, though.

01:07:09.480 --> 01:07:10.700
Thank you to CISO for taking a chance on us.

01:07:10.700 --> 01:07:12.020
Please tweet about that.

01:07:12.020 --> 01:07:13.260
Help us spread the word.

01:07:13.260 --> 01:07:16.340
Tweet at CISO TV and say good job.

01:07:16.340 --> 01:07:17.180
Good job.

01:07:17.180 --> 01:07:18.000
You nailed it.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:18.840
Yeah, don't say good job.

01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:19.680
No, well.

01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:20.500
Say great job.

01:07:20.500 --> 01:07:21.960
We'll see how the show turns out.

01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:22.820
Anything else?

01:07:22.820 --> 01:07:24.740
Oh, thanks to Billions who booked

01:07:24.740 --> 01:07:26.660
without whom this show would not be possible.

01:07:26.660 --> 01:07:27.500
Yeah, thank you.

01:07:27.500 --> 01:07:28.320
Thanks to Billions.

01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:29.160
And.

01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:30.260
You want to thank anybody, John?

01:07:30.260 --> 01:07:31.100
You want to get some thanks out there?

01:07:31.100 --> 01:07:31.920
Yeah, you want anything else?

01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:35.300
I want to thank all my brothers for having me on the stage.

01:07:35.300 --> 01:07:37.260
Aw, he's a sweetheart.

01:07:37.260 --> 01:07:38.600
And so are you.

01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:39.700
We got one final yahoo.

01:07:39.700 --> 01:07:40.540
Wait, hold on.

01:07:40.540 --> 01:07:42.700
I also want to say thank you to our wives and stuff.

01:07:42.700 --> 01:07:43.520
Yes, thank you.

01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:44.360
Thank you, Rachel.

01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:45.820
Thanks to my baby for being so chill.

01:07:45.820 --> 01:07:48.220
I was also going to thank all of my wives over there.

01:07:48.220 --> 01:07:50.700
I was also going to thank all of my wives over there.

01:07:50.700 --> 01:07:51.860
How about this final yahoo, though?

01:07:51.860 --> 01:07:53.860
I just want to send up our level 9,000 Yahoo Juju

01:07:53.860 --> 01:07:54.700
to have important support.

01:07:54.700 --> 01:07:55.540
Whoa!

01:07:55.540 --> 01:07:56.360
Whoa!

01:07:56.360 --> 01:07:57.200
Whoa!

01:07:57.200 --> 01:07:58.040
Whoa!

01:07:58.040 --> 01:07:58.860
Whoa!

01:07:58.860 --> 01:07:59.700
Whoa!

01:07:59.700 --> 01:08:00.820
So we have our answers user.

01:08:00.820 --> 01:08:02.060
Sorry, something's gone wrong.

01:08:02.060 --> 01:08:04.780
It certainly has.

01:08:04.780 --> 01:08:08.360
Who asks, is Wario really all that bad?

01:08:08.360 --> 01:08:09.980
Asking for my children.

01:08:09.980 --> 01:08:12.940
My name is Justin McElroy.

01:08:12.940 --> 01:08:14.140
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:08:14.140 --> 01:08:15.060
I'm Griffin McElroy.

01:08:15.060 --> 01:08:16.020
I'm John Hodgman.

01:08:16.020 --> 01:08:17.380
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

01:08:17.380 --> 01:08:20.100
Kiss your dad square on the lips.

01:08:20.100 --> 01:08:22.020
God bless you.

01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:26.500
Kiss your family.
