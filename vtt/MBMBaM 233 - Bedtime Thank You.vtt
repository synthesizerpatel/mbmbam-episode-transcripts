00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:48.880
Hello, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me, an advice show for the modern era. Welcome

00:48.880 --> 00:54.400
to a super sexy evening performance. I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy.

00:54.960 --> 00:57.440
I'm your middle-aged brother Travis McElroy.

00:57.440 --> 01:04.160
And I'm famed R&B performer D'Angelo. Welcome D'Angelo to the show. We never record in the

01:04.160 --> 01:08.400
evening, but it's Sunday evening. I've got an old-fashioned with one of those giant

01:08.400 --> 01:14.080
round ice cubes in it. My sister Taylor got me the molds for Christmas, and I'm wearing some

01:14.720 --> 01:20.080
red plaid pants and an Oh Yeah Dude t-shirt, and I'm just ready to get narcissistic.

01:20.080 --> 01:22.640
Does this count as an Oh Yeah Dude crossover, then?

01:22.640 --> 01:23.040
No.

01:23.040 --> 01:28.160
This is an Oh Yeah Dude crossover episode. We wrote it all before the show.

01:28.720 --> 01:29.520
We hope you like it.

01:29.520 --> 01:31.200
Got a great, we got a great script.

01:33.120 --> 01:36.400
You know what? I'm looking over it, and this script is basically word for word the

01:36.400 --> 01:38.320
same as Thrilling Adventure Hour.

01:38.320 --> 01:38.960
Yeah, only-

01:38.960 --> 01:40.960
Have we just been stealing all of our jokes?

01:40.960 --> 01:42.400
Only a lot more anti-Semitic.

01:43.120 --> 01:45.200
A lot? Well, 50% more.

01:45.200 --> 01:49.680
Gotta take a red pen to some of this anti-Semitism. It's too late to do the show.

01:50.320 --> 01:52.000
It's 8 p.m. on a Sunday.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.520
This is- It's only 6 p.m.

01:53.520 --> 01:55.840
This is my fucking special time.

01:55.840 --> 01:58.000
Guys, how was your New Year's?

01:59.520 --> 02:00.080
Pretty good.

02:01.200 --> 02:06.720
I rung it in the only way I know how. Dressed as a monk at a murder mystery in a castle in the

02:06.720 --> 02:08.080
middle of Ohio.

02:08.080 --> 02:10.960
Just traditional Justin New Year celebrations.

02:12.320 --> 02:18.560
That's a real thing that you did. When you're doing all of that dumb, nerdy shit, do you also

02:18.560 --> 02:23.520
like pop champagne and sing Auld Lang Syne and do the normal shit, or is it just midnight comes

02:23.520 --> 02:26.240
and goes and you're like, oh, I missed it because I found a new clue?

02:27.200 --> 02:33.840
No, there is a group sing, I should say. A bunch of people get together, pop the corks.

02:33.840 --> 02:38.080
I didn't do that because I went to go be with my baby who was asleep, so I just kind of

02:38.080 --> 02:41.040
stared at it as the New Year came in.

02:41.040 --> 02:42.880
Auld Lang Syne.

02:42.880 --> 02:43.440
Got some-

02:43.440 --> 02:44.800
Looking handsome, baby.

02:44.800 --> 02:46.400
You are the future, baby.

02:46.400 --> 02:50.640
We got some 2015 promises to make and break.

02:50.640 --> 02:56.800
I had a fun experience. There's a cell phone reception, so we went to go eat at this pizza

02:56.800 --> 03:06.480
restaurant halfway through the weekend, and then I got a tweet from someone, and the tweet

03:06.480 --> 03:11.200
said, new mystery, Justin McElroy. I know we were spending New Year's Eve and I'm watching

03:11.200 --> 03:13.520
you. Try to find me before it's too late.

03:13.520 --> 03:20.800
So that is like a crazy tweet, but it turned out it was just a very pleasant gentleman

03:20.800 --> 03:25.760
and his lady friend or wife who were at the murder mystery also because they heard about

03:25.760 --> 03:30.000
it on my brother and me. Yes, but I was very unnerving.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.560
So the tweet was just a red herring.

03:32.560 --> 03:37.360
But that could have turned into a legit murder mystery, only not very mysterious because

03:37.360 --> 03:39.040
it was the tweeter that didn't-

03:39.040 --> 03:40.000
Check my tweets.

03:40.000 --> 03:46.240
Check his tweets. I'm Agent Johnson with Cybercrime, and let me check the tweets.

03:46.240 --> 03:48.640
And it was this guy that did murder Justin.

03:48.640 --> 03:50.880
It was someone named Poops McGee.

03:51.760 --> 03:53.280
That may not be his real name.

03:53.280 --> 03:56.960
This week on Who Did Murder Justin, it was the Twitterer.

03:56.960 --> 04:01.760
It took me three minutes on Twitter, and in that time I figured out that Justin was killed

04:01.760 --> 04:08.240
by Thomas, and also I know the lyrics to every One Direction song that is possible.

04:08.240 --> 04:10.960
Also, that Jaden Smith, pretty crazy, huh?

04:10.960 --> 04:17.120
Creepy, but basically the coolest person who's ever lived, and he's eight.

04:18.080 --> 04:24.320
So this is our advice podcast where we turn your questions alchemy-like into wisdom.

04:24.320 --> 04:26.720
I'm ready, if you all are ready-

04:26.720 --> 04:27.840
I'm ready and sweaty.

04:27.840 --> 04:28.880
To get rolling.

04:30.320 --> 04:32.640
Try this email from Empty Stoppings that you forwarded over.

04:32.640 --> 04:34.160
Was that for reading on the program?

04:34.160 --> 04:38.560
Um, I mean, if you want to, it was more just for you to enjoy.

04:38.560 --> 04:41.840
I just wanted, well, I'll take a quick sidebar, because we're in the new year now.

04:41.840 --> 04:43.360
Twenty-grifteen, the con is on.

04:44.160 --> 04:47.520
So the charity is behind us, but I did want to tell you all-

04:47.520 --> 04:49.360
This is our friend, my brother, my brother and me.

04:49.360 --> 04:50.880
Farewell to charity.

04:50.880 --> 04:52.640
Farewell to charity, the con is on.

04:53.520 --> 04:57.600
I got a very nice email for those of you who participated in the NBNBAM Angels program

04:57.600 --> 05:00.320
where we help fill empty stockings in the Tri-State region.

05:00.320 --> 05:04.160
Um, I got an email from Terry over at the Cabell County Community Services org

05:04.160 --> 05:07.360
who said, we receive calls and Christmas gifts from your listeners,

05:07.360 --> 05:10.560
including those from California, Colorado, Indiana, and Virginia.

05:10.560 --> 05:13.520
We were able to help thirteen hundred and f-

05:13.520 --> 05:17.680
Sorry, we were able to help three hundred and fifteen people.

05:17.680 --> 05:19.760
Not quite as great as thirteen hundred.

05:19.760 --> 05:23.120
Three hundred is pretty good, but add an extra thousand to that

05:23.120 --> 05:24.480
and it's a whole different ballgame.

05:24.480 --> 05:26.240
Maybe next year.

05:26.240 --> 05:29.600
Your listeners have a wonderful caring and giving spirit

05:29.600 --> 05:31.920
We appreciate everything that you did to help us.

05:31.920 --> 05:34.000
We hope you and your listeners have a very blessed year.

05:34.000 --> 05:34.880
Thank you, Terry.

05:34.880 --> 05:35.920
The con is on.

05:35.920 --> 05:36.560
The year will be blessed.

05:36.560 --> 05:38.960
Unfortunately, Terry, there will be no reprise

05:38.960 --> 05:42.400
because we arbitrarily decided not to go with 2015.

05:42.400 --> 05:44.240
If only we had removed that one letter.

05:44.240 --> 05:45.360
Oh, if only.

05:45.360 --> 05:49.440
Thirteen hundred human souls, but unfortunately the con is on.

05:50.080 --> 05:54.320
Sorry, Terry, who also said that our listeners have a wonderful caring giving spirit.

05:54.320 --> 05:55.120
I know better.

05:55.120 --> 05:59.200
I know that basically our listeners are trying to make up for some secret sin

05:59.200 --> 06:01.280
that they can never expunge from their souls.

06:01.280 --> 06:02.400
This year, all sin.

06:02.400 --> 06:05.040
We are Fagan and you are Fagan's boys, listeners.

06:05.040 --> 06:06.240
Have you guys seen Leverage?

06:06.240 --> 06:10.320
It's like that, where they do good, but it's because they're bad.

06:10.320 --> 06:10.880
Nope.

06:10.880 --> 06:12.240
2015, the con is on.

06:12.240 --> 06:13.440
Jims and bonds.

06:13.440 --> 06:14.160
I want them both.

06:15.760 --> 06:16.720
Jims and bonds.

06:16.720 --> 06:17.440
Jims and bonds.

06:17.440 --> 06:18.800
So, let's answer some questions.

06:18.800 --> 06:19.760
P.O. Box 54.

06:22.880 --> 06:25.920
I recently went into a restaurant with the sole purpose of purchasing a gift certificate

06:25.920 --> 06:28.480
for a friend of mine who had expressed interest in that establishment.

06:28.480 --> 06:29.040
Pretty good gift.

06:29.040 --> 06:29.760
P.O. Box 54.

06:29.760 --> 06:34.240
When the bartender brought me the check, I noticed there was a line on which to enter a tip

06:34.240 --> 06:36.160
for the bartender who had served me.

06:36.160 --> 06:40.080
I was unsure about how to tip or if to tip at all in this circumstance,

06:40.080 --> 06:43.280
so I shrugged, threw in one dollar tip and signed.

06:43.280 --> 06:44.720
Brothers, did I do the right thing?

06:44.720 --> 06:46.080
Did I tip too little?

06:46.080 --> 06:48.560
Or is tipping not necessary in this situation?

06:48.560 --> 06:50.880
As from tipping remiss in St. Louis.

06:50.880 --> 06:56.400
In case you were wondering, the gift certificate was for $50 and they tipped a dollar.

06:56.400 --> 06:58.160
Okay, but that's okay.

06:58.160 --> 06:59.040
Does it matter?

06:59.040 --> 07:00.560
It's a fucking gift card.

07:00.560 --> 07:01.520
Here's why it matters.

07:01.520 --> 07:03.040
First of all, you fucked up.

07:03.040 --> 07:04.880
But second of all, here's why it matters.

07:04.880 --> 07:08.720
I really like the logic of saying, I'm not sure if I'm supposed to tip or not.

07:10.320 --> 07:10.800
I know.

07:11.360 --> 07:12.320
I'll tip 2%.

07:14.320 --> 07:15.040
Right.

07:15.040 --> 07:19.040
It's sort of like you would probably, it would probably be less offensive to tip nothing.

07:19.040 --> 07:19.280
Yeah.

07:19.280 --> 07:20.640
But this, this motherfucking bartender-

07:20.640 --> 07:24.000
One drink, one $50 gift certificate, it's a dollar either way.

07:24.000 --> 07:28.720
This fucking bartender didn't put fucking mint into a mortar and pestle and then grind

07:28.720 --> 07:34.720
those oils, those essential oils out and then light like an orange peel on fire over it

07:34.720 --> 07:39.600
and spritz it with forbidden citruses and then said, okay, here's your gift card.

07:39.600 --> 07:42.320
He swiped it through the thing and pressed like three buttons.

07:42.320 --> 07:45.600
You give him fucking a 10 spot for that?

07:45.600 --> 07:46.960
This is no, this is a no-go.

07:46.960 --> 07:50.560
I'm saying that you didn't need, but this is very indicative.

07:50.560 --> 07:53.040
I feel guilty whenever stuff like this comes up.

07:53.040 --> 07:57.600
And I think it's just like, now it's just standard that most receipts print off no matter

07:57.600 --> 08:00.160
what, especially like you're at a bar already.

08:00.160 --> 08:02.320
So it's like, it's going to print off with a tip.

08:02.320 --> 08:04.080
You're probably safe here.

08:04.080 --> 08:07.920
But I kind of dig on a dollar though, because it's like the same amount of effort that would

08:07.920 --> 08:14.400
be required to get a fucking Miller Lite out from the cooler and then pop the top of that

08:14.400 --> 08:17.840
delicious refresco beverage and then hand it to you.

08:17.840 --> 08:19.920
And that's $3 and you give them one, right?

08:19.920 --> 08:24.400
That's the quintessential buying a beer at a bar sort of transaction.

08:24.400 --> 08:28.320
And I think that you give them that same single, that Miller Lite single.

08:28.320 --> 08:28.880
I don't know.

08:28.880 --> 08:32.320
I just feel like giving them a tip on that is saying like, you need this more than me.

08:32.320 --> 08:33.680
No, it's recognition.

08:33.680 --> 08:34.960
It's game recognizing game.

08:34.960 --> 08:36.240
It is good to tip.

08:36.240 --> 08:41.600
Okay, to be clear, I think it's important to tip when you get carry out, right?

08:41.600 --> 08:43.840
Like you guys tip when you're getting a carry out.

08:43.840 --> 08:45.120
Oh, absolutely not.

08:46.160 --> 08:47.440
What, really?

08:47.440 --> 08:47.940
Yeah.

08:47.940 --> 08:49.300
Why not?

08:49.300 --> 08:50.980
But they did that work.

08:50.980 --> 08:51.540
Who did that work?

08:51.540 --> 08:52.260
They carried it.

08:52.260 --> 08:54.180
They carried it to you in a bag.

08:54.180 --> 08:56.180
From one place, from like 18 feet?

08:56.980 --> 08:59.060
Sorry, what do you think they're doing normally?

09:00.580 --> 09:01.860
It's like 36 feet.

09:01.860 --> 09:03.140
Yeah, but then it's repeated things.

09:03.140 --> 09:07.460
It's water and it's bread and it's more bread and then it's butter and then it's more bread.

09:07.460 --> 09:08.420
And then are you serious?

09:08.420 --> 09:08.900
More bread.

09:08.900 --> 09:10.340
And then seriously more bread.

09:10.340 --> 09:11.380
I'm worried about you.

09:11.380 --> 09:12.020
Please stop.

09:12.020 --> 09:13.460
It's 2015.

09:13.460 --> 09:14.500
Take care of yourself.

09:14.500 --> 09:17.300
I have a gluten opposite of allergy.

09:17.300 --> 09:18.020
Addiction?

09:18.020 --> 09:18.740
Yeah.

09:18.740 --> 09:22.580
Okay, Griffin, I'm going to tell you why it's the same thing for me.

09:22.580 --> 09:23.220
Okay.

09:23.220 --> 09:31.060
I am tipping waiters and waitresses and servers and whoever to make sure to protect me and my food.

09:31.060 --> 09:31.540
That's it.

09:31.540 --> 09:32.580
It's not the service.

09:32.580 --> 09:33.540
It's not all that.

09:33.540 --> 09:37.060
I'm tipping them to make sure the transaction goes smoothly.

09:37.780 --> 09:39.380
It's food insurance?

09:39.380 --> 09:40.420
Yeah, basically.

09:41.140 --> 09:43.940
I don't want to roll up to pick up my carry out and they're like,

09:43.940 --> 09:47.860
oh, sorry, that didn't go through or wasn't ready or whatever. It's cold now.

09:47.860 --> 09:49.460
Oh, they forgot the fries.

09:49.460 --> 09:52.260
You asked for bonus wings and we gave you a bone in wings.

09:52.260 --> 09:54.500
Tipping is an end of game transaction.

09:54.500 --> 09:58.900
They cannot fuck it up and they cannot take that shit out of your hand back to you and say,

09:58.900 --> 10:01.300
hold on, sir, we forgot to fuck this up for you.

10:01.300 --> 10:03.940
That's why it's an exercise in trust.

10:03.940 --> 10:06.420
You're trusting and they're trusting and everybody's trusting.

10:07.140 --> 10:09.300
What if they look at your tip, aren't pleased with it,

10:09.300 --> 10:11.860
and they just take your carry out box and smash it in your chest?

10:12.660 --> 10:13.060
I'm sorry.

10:13.060 --> 10:16.500
I'm going to have to take the fries out of here and just pretend like we forgot them.

10:16.500 --> 10:17.300
Enjoy.

10:17.300 --> 10:22.820
Ah, God, why can't we all just do it in the Japanese style where you just don't do it?

10:22.820 --> 10:25.540
There's no tipping because everybody's paid a great wage.

10:25.540 --> 10:28.180
Everybody's paid a great wage and you don't have to worry about shit like this.

10:28.180 --> 10:29.380
I'm a great tipper.

10:29.380 --> 10:31.380
I truly am a tremendous tipper.

10:31.380 --> 10:36.340
Cab rides, hotel service, meal service, not carry out because fuck that noise.

10:36.340 --> 10:37.540
But carry out's a perfect example.

10:37.540 --> 10:38.660
It's one of those in between.

10:38.660 --> 10:39.940
It's one of those gray areas.

10:39.940 --> 10:45.940
If I go to an airport Hudson News and I buy my vitamin water zero lemonade flavor

10:45.940 --> 10:50.980
and there's a fucking spot to tip on that Hudson News, I don't think so.

10:50.980 --> 10:54.260
Have you guys ever tipped a shuttle driver at the airport?

10:54.260 --> 10:55.220
Oh my God, that just...

10:55.220 --> 10:56.740
Okay, I just got back from the airport.

10:56.740 --> 10:57.300
Okay.

10:57.300 --> 10:59.140
Flight to St. Louis and I saw someone do it.

10:59.140 --> 11:01.220
It's the first time I've ever seen anyone do it.

11:01.860 --> 11:03.300
Exact same thing happened to us.

11:03.300 --> 11:07.620
I felt so terrible because I was like, that's a whole other fucking echelon.

11:07.620 --> 11:09.620
I haven't even considered why can't we do it.

11:09.620 --> 11:11.300
In the Japanese style.

11:12.420 --> 11:15.220
If you're traveling in America, not in the Japanese style,

11:15.220 --> 11:16.740
if you're traveling in America at this point,

11:16.740 --> 11:19.220
you should pretty much just get a wad of ones

11:19.220 --> 11:21.220
and just walk around with your left arm extended.

11:21.220 --> 11:21.860
I don't, right.

11:21.860 --> 11:23.140
Just like a bouquet of ones.

11:23.140 --> 11:25.540
Just please, if you're supposed to take one of these, will you please just take it?

11:25.540 --> 11:27.460
Honor system, need a dollar, take a dollar.

11:28.420 --> 11:30.580
Am I supposed to say, if I'm supposed to give you a dollar,

11:30.580 --> 11:31.700
please just take as many as I'm supposed to give you.

11:31.700 --> 11:35.060
I wish it wasn't so awkward to just look at someone and go, do I give you this?

11:36.100 --> 11:37.300
Is this for you?

11:37.300 --> 11:38.100
Do I do this?

11:38.100 --> 11:39.940
And they go, no, it's okay.

11:39.940 --> 11:42.100
I never have cash dollar bills on me.

11:42.100 --> 11:42.900
So what am I supposed to do?

11:42.900 --> 11:46.020
Like turn to the fucking airport shuttle driver and be like, do you have Square?

11:47.300 --> 11:48.180
Pardon me, sir.

11:49.140 --> 11:52.180
I see this shuttle bus is equipped with a handicap ramp.

11:52.180 --> 11:53.620
Does it also have Square?

11:55.460 --> 11:57.460
Tap to pay with my iPhone?

11:57.460 --> 11:58.100
Is that cool?

11:58.900 --> 12:02.820
Do you have near field communication technology, good sir?

12:02.820 --> 12:03.940
What's your email address?

12:03.940 --> 12:05.300
Let me PayPal you $3.

12:06.980 --> 12:07.780
What a nightmare.

12:07.780 --> 12:08.260
Why can't we just-

12:08.260 --> 12:09.620
It will be a transaction fee.

12:09.620 --> 12:11.220
You are not friends nor family.

12:11.220 --> 12:15.460
We've already declared that 2015 is when the con got on.

12:16.340 --> 12:19.300
But I think 2016 is when we all start trying to convert everything

12:19.300 --> 12:21.620
we possibly can to the Japanese style.

12:21.620 --> 12:23.620
You can't even ask.

12:23.620 --> 12:28.180
You can't ask if tipping is appropriate because they're basically saying like,

12:28.180 --> 12:29.060
do you want some money?

12:29.060 --> 12:29.540
Yeah.

12:29.540 --> 12:30.340
I have some money.

12:30.340 --> 12:31.220
Do you need it?

12:31.220 --> 12:35.380
That's why there needs to be a second person on like the shuttle that works for them,

12:35.380 --> 12:38.580
but it's not the driver that you can go to and go, do I tip the driver?

12:38.580 --> 12:40.420
And their only job is to say yes or no.

12:41.300 --> 12:43.620
And then do you tip that person, Travis?

12:43.620 --> 12:47.460
Well, then it becomes like a matryoshka doll, I think it's called.

12:48.260 --> 12:52.020
And you just have to keep asking tinier and tinier people.

12:52.020 --> 12:52.900
Exactly.

12:52.900 --> 12:56.420
And then in the back of the shuttle, a very, very, very tiny bathroom attendant.

12:56.420 --> 12:57.380
He's like, I got mints.

12:57.380 --> 12:58.740
And it's like, I don't want mints.

12:58.740 --> 13:02.740
Do I still need to give you like $5 for offering me mints?

13:02.740 --> 13:05.700
And by the end of it, you're just asking Amelie for advice,

13:05.700 --> 13:08.340
who you can't tip because the coin's too big for her and knocks her over.

13:08.340 --> 13:09.860
Don't try to tip or you'll kill her.

13:10.420 --> 13:11.940
Please leave Amelie out of this.

13:11.940 --> 13:12.340
Please.

13:12.340 --> 13:14.260
I'm under your 50 cent piece.

13:14.260 --> 13:16.020
Please help, I'm dying.

13:16.020 --> 13:16.820
Do you guys want a yahoo?

13:16.820 --> 13:18.980
Yeah, yahoo.

13:18.980 --> 13:20.260
This yahoo is sinning by level.

13:20.260 --> 13:23.140
By the way, yahoo me is something I've tried out for 2015.

13:23.140 --> 13:23.860
Look for the t-shirt.

13:23.860 --> 13:25.380
Oh wait, do it like a question.

13:25.380 --> 13:26.420
Like yahoo me?

13:26.980 --> 13:28.020
Yeah guys, what do you think about this?

13:28.020 --> 13:33.940
Yahoo me, this is sinning by level, billion Drew Davenport.

13:33.940 --> 13:34.500
Thank you, Drew.

13:34.500 --> 13:37.940
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Master Ahmad, who asks,

13:39.780 --> 13:42.340
can anyone tell me who invented hatred?

13:43.620 --> 13:47.460
I mean, in other words, which specific individual that created

13:47.460 --> 13:50.100
invented the idea of hatred in the first place?

13:52.340 --> 13:53.700
The answer is the devil.

13:53.700 --> 13:54.660
That's Cain.

13:54.660 --> 13:58.020
That's actually the top answer on Yahoo Answers.

13:58.020 --> 13:59.140
So thank you, Travis.

13:59.140 --> 14:01.940
By which I mean Travis, by which I mean Yahoo Answers user,

14:01.940 --> 14:06.100
Woofer Duff, who provided that answer for Cain.

14:06.100 --> 14:07.140
Is that really where it came from?

14:07.140 --> 14:09.620
Like biblically speaking, Cain was like, oh no.

14:10.340 --> 14:12.420
Oh, I'm going to get that, Abel.

14:12.420 --> 14:14.980
They were kind of a, they were very much like a road runner

14:14.980 --> 14:16.180
and coyote kind of thing.

14:16.820 --> 14:19.540
So nobody up to that point, like it fucking-

14:19.540 --> 14:21.300
There were only three other people.

14:21.300 --> 14:23.860
Right, but Abel like fucking kicks Abraham in the shins

14:23.860 --> 14:24.900
because he's a shitty little kid.

14:24.900 --> 14:28.100
And Abraham's like, thank you, I guess.

14:28.100 --> 14:30.100
Abraham wasn't there, Griffin.

14:30.100 --> 14:35.460
Yeah, it was Abraham, Father Abraham, Cain, Abel, Adam.

14:36.740 --> 14:38.580
Not Steve though, that's important.

14:38.580 --> 14:41.540
I've always found this story confusing because I remember

14:41.540 --> 14:45.700
being in church camp and the guy, the youth pastor,

14:45.700 --> 14:48.580
made a big deal of this was the first murder in the Bible.

14:48.580 --> 14:51.060
This is the root of murder, Cain and Abel.

14:51.060 --> 14:54.020
And then as I was walking back to my door room,

14:54.020 --> 14:58.820
probably to masturbate, I thought to myself,

14:58.820 --> 15:02.100
you know what, he's also the first person to die,

15:02.100 --> 15:04.820
which must have been a trip for Cain.

15:04.820 --> 15:06.420
Whoa, wait, what?

15:06.420 --> 15:09.860
Hey, Abel, I hit him really hard and now he's not getting up.

15:09.860 --> 15:11.060
I just like, Abel, get up.

15:11.060 --> 15:13.460
I like hit him with a rock as a fucking goof.

15:13.460 --> 15:15.060
Like what the fuck?

15:15.060 --> 15:17.540
I even said heads up when I did it.

15:17.540 --> 15:19.380
It was supposed to be like a thing.

15:19.380 --> 15:22.420
Abraham, yo, Abel's like stopped.

15:22.420 --> 15:23.620
Abel like stopped, what's up?

15:23.620 --> 15:25.540
There's not even a word for it.

15:25.540 --> 15:26.580
Is there a word for this?

15:26.580 --> 15:28.660
He just stopped, I brokeed it in.

15:28.660 --> 15:29.060
You know what?

15:29.060 --> 15:30.980
I had an Abel but I breaked him.

15:30.980 --> 15:31.460
What happened?

15:31.460 --> 15:35.300
I never thought about it, but it's like Edison, Einstein,

15:35.300 --> 15:37.780
Cain, he invented death.

15:37.780 --> 15:38.180
Yeah.

15:38.180 --> 15:39.620
That's pretty big.

15:39.620 --> 15:40.420
And hatred.

15:40.980 --> 15:43.220
I don't know how much more we're gonna goof on this,

15:43.220 --> 15:46.980
but Griffin, do yourself a solid and stop referencing Abraham

15:46.980 --> 15:49.380
because you're exponentially increasing the number of tweets

15:49.380 --> 15:52.740
you're about to receive from the Venn Diagram crossover

15:52.740 --> 15:54.420
of biblical scholars and my brother, my brother,

15:54.420 --> 15:55.060
my listeners.

15:55.060 --> 15:58.580
So it was Adam and Eve that popped them out, Cain and Abel?

15:58.580 --> 16:01.060
So all the babies came from just Adam and Eve?

16:01.060 --> 16:03.220
No, it was Adam, Abraham, and Eve.

16:03.220 --> 16:06.900
So there's a little DNA mix up.

16:06.900 --> 16:07.460
Okay.

16:07.460 --> 16:11.780
Well, I think that this is probably 100% true.

16:11.780 --> 16:14.020
I think Cain probably invented it.

16:14.020 --> 16:17.540
And then just like the only other two people on earth

16:17.540 --> 16:19.780
saw it and was like, that looks all right.

16:19.780 --> 16:20.340
Hatred?

16:20.340 --> 16:20.500
Yeah.

16:20.500 --> 16:21.620
Let me give that a try.

16:21.620 --> 16:22.500
And that's where it all focused.

16:22.500 --> 16:24.580
We should all just keep this train rolling.

16:24.580 --> 16:25.060
Yeah.

16:25.060 --> 16:25.860
What is that called?

16:25.860 --> 16:26.340
Hatred?

16:26.900 --> 16:27.860
Let me give that a shot.

16:29.060 --> 16:30.660
Oh, I hate you birds.

16:30.660 --> 16:32.820
Do you think that God at that point was like,

16:32.820 --> 16:35.060
I kicked you guys out of the garden for eating an apple

16:35.060 --> 16:37.460
and then step two was this.

16:38.100 --> 16:38.900
You fucked up.

16:38.900 --> 16:39.060
Yeah.

16:39.060 --> 16:40.020
I was just thinking that, Travis.

16:40.020 --> 16:43.460
Gama's been like, okay, there are like four of you.

16:43.460 --> 16:43.780
Yeah.

16:43.780 --> 16:46.180
Can you slow your roll for one sec?

16:46.180 --> 16:47.700
I was gonna let you back in.

16:47.700 --> 16:48.420
Ask Jesus.

16:48.420 --> 16:49.860
I was just talking to him when I said like,

16:49.860 --> 16:51.140
you know, I think I'm gonna let him back in.

16:51.140 --> 16:52.180
Jesus, I felt bad last night.

16:52.180 --> 16:54.100
He was like, I'm gonna put him on a 30-day probation.

16:54.100 --> 16:57.620
They fucking murdered, there were four of them.

16:57.620 --> 16:59.780
They had a one in four chance.

17:00.500 --> 17:03.940
He killed, name another criminal of history

17:03.940 --> 17:06.820
that killed 25% of the human race in one day.

17:07.700 --> 17:09.380
With one stupid ass rock.

17:09.380 --> 17:13.940
Uh, uh, Adam's only got so many fucking ribs.

17:13.940 --> 17:16.020
I can't keep fucking popping these dudes out.

17:16.740 --> 17:17.940
Griffin, I think at that point,

17:17.940 --> 17:20.180
Adam and Eve had making people covered.

17:20.740 --> 17:22.340
Maybe, they only did it twice.

17:22.340 --> 17:23.540
I'm not, they're not experts.

17:23.540 --> 17:24.820
They're not the fucking Duggars.

17:27.220 --> 17:30.100
19 kids and counting and oh, wait, 18.

17:30.100 --> 17:30.500
Damn it.

17:31.060 --> 17:32.180
Oh, wait, shit.

17:32.180 --> 17:33.220
There's like 12.

17:33.220 --> 17:34.580
What's going on?

17:34.580 --> 17:35.780
Hi, the rocks.

17:35.780 --> 17:36.500
Wasn't me.

17:38.180 --> 17:38.900
Fuck.

17:38.900 --> 17:41.220
I mean, I want to read that Family Circus comic now.

17:42.100 --> 17:43.780
Follow just like the bloody footprints

17:43.780 --> 17:44.900
around the Garden of Eden.

17:46.180 --> 17:46.980
Where's Kane?

17:47.700 --> 17:48.340
Wasn't me.

17:49.780 --> 17:51.540
Let's, uh, another question.

17:51.540 --> 17:55.940
As a cable guy, I can really get into intimate parts of your home.

17:55.940 --> 17:56.660
Whoa, fuck.

17:57.300 --> 17:58.740
Stop with the presses.

17:58.740 --> 18:01.860
As a cable guy, I can really get into intimate parts of your home

18:01.860 --> 18:03.140
out of routine necessity.

18:03.140 --> 18:05.220
So I'm privy to a lot of secrets.

18:06.660 --> 18:07.460
Secrets.

18:07.460 --> 18:11.060
What do you think I should do if I find something potentially dangerous

18:11.060 --> 18:14.020
but incriminating, like drugs under a kid's bed?

18:14.020 --> 18:14.980
Do I narc?

18:14.980 --> 18:16.740
Are you fucking kidding me?

18:17.380 --> 18:18.180
Let me finish.

18:18.180 --> 18:22.020
I don't want to create a chaotic atmosphere while I'm doing my job.

18:22.020 --> 18:23.780
Your cable guy works hard, you guys,

18:24.820 --> 18:28.020
but I don't want to just let someone get hurt through inaction.

18:28.020 --> 18:30.180
How would you handle this kind of situation?

18:30.180 --> 18:31.460
That's from Brothers.

18:31.460 --> 18:33.460
How would you handle this kind of situation, brothers?

18:33.460 --> 18:36.260
That's from Indecisive in Indianapolis.

18:36.260 --> 18:39.780
I would recommend that you just be fucking cool for, like, a second.

18:40.580 --> 18:44.340
Yeah, could you just be cool and not try to narc on Kenny,

18:44.340 --> 18:46.980
the 12-year-old who's just trying to sell some weed,

18:46.980 --> 18:48.820
to buy Pokemon cards?

18:48.820 --> 18:52.900
Is there, like, a cable guy oath that you take that's, like,

18:52.900 --> 18:54.900
and keep your shit quiet?

18:54.900 --> 18:57.220
Or it's, like, while in the course of your duties,

18:57.780 --> 19:00.100
if you spy with your little eye something pinky?

19:00.100 --> 19:00.340
That's it.

19:00.340 --> 19:04.820
I think Ty Mourner is in cahoots with the fucking one time.

19:04.820 --> 19:07.220
I think everything's autopsy-tervium,

19:07.220 --> 19:08.420
canceling all my cable.

19:08.420 --> 19:09.060
Just kidding.

19:09.060 --> 19:11.140
I haven't had cable for eight years

19:11.140 --> 19:13.060
because I have a lot of weed stashed all over my house.

19:13.620 --> 19:15.940
I'm afraid they'll find my secrets.

19:15.940 --> 19:18.580
What are you even fucking talking about, do you narc?

19:18.580 --> 19:20.900
It's not your goddamn family to ruin.

19:20.900 --> 19:22.260
Yeah, ma'am, just sign here.

19:23.140 --> 19:24.740
Oh, yeah, that's your warranty there.

19:24.740 --> 19:28.740
And also, your son has some sweet, sticky weed under his bed.

19:28.740 --> 19:29.780
Okay, bye.

19:29.780 --> 19:32.020
Is this hypothetical or is this a fucking quandary

19:32.020 --> 19:33.220
that this person's wrestling with?

19:33.220 --> 19:35.140
Because we can put this to bed super easy.

19:35.140 --> 19:37.140
Be fucking cool for, like, a second.

19:37.140 --> 19:38.740
Just put the cable in and walk out.

19:38.740 --> 19:39.220
And walk out.

19:39.220 --> 19:41.220
Do your goddamn job and walk away.

19:41.220 --> 19:43.060
What are you even talking about, do you narc?

19:43.060 --> 19:46.980
Is there a thing, like, you find under the kid's bed,

19:46.980 --> 19:49.860
like, a stash of, I don't know, like, guns?

19:50.820 --> 19:51.780
Do you say something?

19:51.780 --> 19:54.500
No, no, because a second amendment guarantees

19:54.500 --> 19:55.860
a certain freedoms, Travis.

19:55.860 --> 19:57.940
Like, gun, like, infinite guns forever.

19:58.500 --> 20:00.740
Unless you have a knife that has, like,

20:00.740 --> 20:02.420
a note attached to it that says, like,

20:02.420 --> 20:04.820
four Darryl's guts and then a date.

20:06.420 --> 20:07.780
And your name is Darryl.

20:08.500 --> 20:10.420
And also, your name is Darryl and, oh, god,

20:10.420 --> 20:11.220
look out behind you.

20:11.860 --> 20:13.220
I think you just-

20:13.220 --> 20:14.740
That knife was a red herring.

20:16.500 --> 20:18.420
Do you really want people to start-

20:18.420 --> 20:21.940
Do you want to give human race another reason

20:21.940 --> 20:23.700
to dislike the cable guy?

20:23.700 --> 20:25.940
Really, have you guys had it so easy

20:25.940 --> 20:29.060
in the rep department that you also want to add narc

20:29.060 --> 20:31.220
to the list of, oh, god, where is he?

20:31.220 --> 20:33.780
If a cable guy narked out my fucking son,

20:33.780 --> 20:36.980
I would say, I have no reason to trust you,

20:36.980 --> 20:37.860
Time Warner.

20:37.860 --> 20:39.220
Get the fuck out of my house.

20:39.220 --> 20:40.500
It's kind of a situation where, like, okay,

20:40.500 --> 20:41.620
yeah, my son's in trouble.

20:41.620 --> 20:42.580
Also, fuck you.

20:43.140 --> 20:44.260
Yeah, fuck off.

20:44.260 --> 20:46.740
I think, also, I can't imagine a situation

20:46.740 --> 20:48.260
in which you don't say anything

20:48.260 --> 20:49.700
and then, like, something goes down

20:49.700 --> 20:52.100
and someone goes, well, why didn't the cable guy

20:52.100 --> 20:52.820
say anything?

20:53.780 --> 20:54.900
He was here.

20:54.900 --> 20:56.340
Surely, if he had seen something,

20:56.340 --> 20:57.700
he would have said something, right?

20:57.700 --> 21:00.660
It's his responsibility as our cable installer.

21:00.660 --> 21:02.820
I think that it's not, none of your business,

21:02.820 --> 21:04.900
not your job, don't worry about it.

21:04.900 --> 21:07.300
Now, now, now, let's approach this

21:07.300 --> 21:10.340
from a 2015 mentality.

21:10.340 --> 21:14.900
If the con is on, I have considered extorting Kenny.

21:15.860 --> 21:17.940
Oh, my god, you have control of the cable.

21:17.940 --> 21:19.780
Get a public access station that only goes

21:19.780 --> 21:21.060
to Kenny's house.

21:21.060 --> 21:23.700
Wait till he turns on the box at night.

21:23.700 --> 21:24.180
Kenny.

21:24.180 --> 21:26.260
Kenny turns on the midnight channel.

21:26.260 --> 21:26.740
What's up?

21:26.740 --> 21:28.900
I know about your doobers, Kenny.

21:28.900 --> 21:29.940
Yeah.

21:29.940 --> 21:32.020
But then, pretty soon, the Kenny Only channel

21:32.020 --> 21:33.700
gets really high ratings

21:33.700 --> 21:35.620
and the people from the VHF channels

21:35.620 --> 21:36.900
come to shut you down.

21:36.900 --> 21:37.620
Yeah.

21:37.620 --> 21:39.140
But look out, Kramer's there

21:39.140 --> 21:40.660
and he's gonna help you raise some money.

21:41.860 --> 21:43.460
I'm just saying you could be rich

21:43.460 --> 21:44.980
with Pochamon cards

21:44.980 --> 21:47.860
if you play your goddamn Pochamon cards, right?

21:47.860 --> 21:49.860
By which, I mean, you wanna have a deck

21:49.860 --> 21:52.180
based on two discrete energy types.

21:52.180 --> 21:54.340
I prefer psychic and fighting

21:54.340 --> 21:56.900
and you don't wanna rely too heavily on evolutions

21:56.900 --> 21:58.980
because that's gonna be predicated

21:58.980 --> 22:00.500
on some pretty lucky card draws.

22:00.500 --> 22:02.820
This has been Pokemon Card Game Strategy Tactics

22:02.820 --> 22:05.220
with your old buddy, Griffin McElroy.

22:05.220 --> 22:06.020
Do you guys wanna Yahoo?

22:06.660 --> 22:07.060
Mm-hmm.

22:07.700 --> 22:09.780
This Yahoo was sent in by Kevin.

22:09.780 --> 22:10.580
Thanks, Kevin.

22:10.580 --> 22:13.220
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Marley, who asks,

22:13.780 --> 22:15.860
do you say thank you after sex?

22:17.300 --> 22:18.980
My boyfriend does at times.

22:18.980 --> 22:20.100
Not sure how to take it.

22:22.580 --> 22:24.660
Justin, I can hear your fucking old fashioned.

22:24.660 --> 22:28.740
I can hear those greasy ice cubes in that high ball.

22:28.740 --> 22:30.340
There's just one ice cube

22:30.340 --> 22:33.140
and it's the size of a tennis ball.

22:33.780 --> 22:34.580
It's amazing.

22:36.340 --> 22:37.620
To answer this question,

22:37.620 --> 22:39.300
I think it all depends on the tone of voice

22:39.300 --> 22:40.580
with which he says it.

22:40.580 --> 22:41.060
Thank you?

22:42.580 --> 22:43.220
Thank you.

22:44.340 --> 22:45.860
So glad that's over with.

22:45.860 --> 22:48.660
What if they sing a little bit of the song

22:48.660 --> 22:50.660
Thank You by Jewel?

22:50.660 --> 22:52.660
Crosses fingers, hopes it's Jewel.

22:52.660 --> 22:56.180
Thank you, Stephanie, for that sex scene.

22:56.900 --> 23:00.420
Thanks for doing the thing with your calves.

23:00.420 --> 23:01.380
With your calves?

23:01.380 --> 23:02.420
Wait, hold on.

23:02.420 --> 23:06.100
What special move does she do with just her calves?

23:06.820 --> 23:10.500
Listen, the whole bit was that it was a weird body part.

23:10.500 --> 23:14.420
Don't maybe open up the Bitcoin and take you inside of it.

23:14.420 --> 23:17.300
Don't maybe dust off the cobwebs of this bit

23:17.300 --> 23:19.300
and show you the cave paintings on the walls.

23:19.300 --> 23:20.580
Just accept it for what it is.

23:20.580 --> 23:24.340
Jess has got on some forbidden scrolls the Kama Sutra too.

23:24.340 --> 23:26.180
And it's made with calf paste.

23:26.180 --> 23:27.380
A lot of calf stuff.

23:27.380 --> 23:29.860
A lot of calf stuff and a lot of cleanup.

23:31.860 --> 23:35.460
Because the first couple times you're not gonna do it right.

23:35.460 --> 23:35.860
No.

23:35.860 --> 23:37.140
You're not gonna do it right.

23:37.700 --> 23:38.500
I mean, it's pretty.

23:38.500 --> 23:40.180
You just put your calves together and go.

23:40.900 --> 23:42.580
You know how to make love, right?

23:42.580 --> 23:47.860
Just put your calves together and go.

23:47.860 --> 23:48.260
Fuck.

23:48.260 --> 23:52.580
Just take the meaty part of your calf and put it against your mouth.

23:55.940 --> 23:56.500
Okay, hold on.

23:56.500 --> 23:57.060
Thank you.

23:57.060 --> 23:57.540
Thank you.

23:58.340 --> 24:00.500
Isn't it better than some other thing?

24:00.500 --> 24:01.940
He could say like, I'm sorry.

24:02.580 --> 24:03.060
No, but-

24:03.060 --> 24:04.180
I'm sorry would be a bad thing.

24:04.180 --> 24:05.460
There's infinity.

24:05.460 --> 24:07.300
You can say anything anytime.

24:07.300 --> 24:11.220
So let's not broaden it to like all of the things that a person can say.

24:11.220 --> 24:11.780
Look out.

24:11.780 --> 24:12.020
Yeah.

24:12.580 --> 24:13.220
Thank you.

24:13.220 --> 24:13.780
Finally.

24:14.420 --> 24:14.900
Nope.

24:14.900 --> 24:15.780
Just thank you.

24:15.780 --> 24:16.420
I did it.

24:16.420 --> 24:18.820
I think thank you is kind of nice.

24:19.300 --> 24:20.100
It is nice.

24:20.100 --> 24:21.700
Thanks for sharing that gift with me.

24:21.700 --> 24:23.540
Until the one time he does it.

24:23.540 --> 24:24.340
No, that's the thing.

24:24.340 --> 24:27.780
If he's gonna do it every time and he does it like a hundred times in a row, right?

24:27.780 --> 24:30.820
And then the one time they make love and he just like, okay, good night.

24:30.820 --> 24:33.700
And you're just like, where's my fucking thank you?

24:33.700 --> 24:36.500
They're falling asleep and she's like, ah, you're welcome.

24:39.300 --> 24:40.100
Thank you.

24:40.100 --> 24:44.820
Oh, what if you get a Pavlovian response to gratitude and you like, you hold the door

24:44.820 --> 24:46.500
open for someone and they're like, thank you.

24:46.500 --> 24:47.700
And you instantly get a boner.

24:47.700 --> 24:48.260
You're welcome.

24:48.260 --> 24:50.340
Also, also I nutted.

24:52.340 --> 24:53.940
You can probably let the door go.

24:53.940 --> 24:55.700
Like nobody else is coming in.

24:55.700 --> 24:59.620
Well, I just want to be sure, you know, you can never be too sure late arrivals and whatnot.

25:00.420 --> 25:02.420
Just keep my roast beef warm.

25:02.420 --> 25:03.380
Are they at Arby's?

25:03.380 --> 25:04.900
Why is it always at Arby's Justin?

25:05.700 --> 25:06.180
What?

25:06.180 --> 25:10.340
Any situation you invent in your mind is always at Arby's.

25:10.340 --> 25:15.380
Is always at Arby's because it's good mood food.

25:15.380 --> 25:15.860
Thank you.

25:15.860 --> 25:26.820
Let's go to my next question.

25:26.820 --> 25:29.220
90% Justin, what's that?

25:30.580 --> 25:31.220
90%.

25:31.220 --> 25:36.820
That's the percent of your life that you're in underwear and underwear gets old fast.

25:36.820 --> 25:38.420
That number seems high.

25:38.420 --> 25:40.260
It seems really, really, really high.

25:40.260 --> 25:40.820
High for me.

25:42.100 --> 25:43.620
You know, I don't sleep.

25:44.180 --> 25:44.740
I sleep.

25:45.940 --> 25:47.380
I don't need inflatron.

25:47.380 --> 25:49.220
Sans pantaloons.

25:49.220 --> 25:50.580
Sans pantalones.

25:51.300 --> 25:53.380
And so it's higher for me.

25:53.380 --> 25:58.740
But anyway, I do wear underwear and I got some me undies.

25:58.740 --> 26:00.900
I know we all have gotten them.

26:00.900 --> 26:07.620
It is, as the advertising states, it's the most comfortable underwear I've ever worn.

26:07.620 --> 26:13.140
And it made me mad that I'm just now getting on this train and I've been wearing, excuse me,

26:13.140 --> 26:17.540
but bad underwear, crummy underwear for 34 years.

26:17.540 --> 26:20.180
Chronically wet underwear everywhere.

26:20.180 --> 26:21.380
Just the worst.

26:21.380 --> 26:22.900
Just inexplicably wet.

26:22.900 --> 26:24.180
Why are you so wet?

26:24.180 --> 26:29.860
Me undies has become my like, I will not travel unless I'm wearing the me undies.

26:29.860 --> 26:32.900
They are the best, most comfortable underpants.

26:32.900 --> 26:36.820
And this is not, this isn't any of that flashy advertising bullshit.

26:36.820 --> 26:38.340
This is straight from the heart.

26:38.340 --> 26:39.380
I love me undies.

26:40.020 --> 26:41.140
They don't ride up.

26:41.140 --> 26:44.740
They pull moisture away from your skin so you can cool all day long.

26:44.740 --> 26:46.260
It's environmentally friendly.

26:46.260 --> 26:47.460
It's low carbon footprint.

26:47.460 --> 26:49.300
There's a very sleek panty line.

26:50.020 --> 26:50.340
Yeah.

26:50.340 --> 26:51.540
Oh, the, yeah.

26:51.540 --> 26:54.180
Oh, and the material is so comfortable.

26:54.180 --> 26:56.980
They're barely, it's a barely their panty line.

26:56.980 --> 27:01.220
They have one pattern that they've sent me that's black and white stripes.

27:01.220 --> 27:03.700
And it makes my dick look like Beetlejuice.

27:03.700 --> 27:08.340
Which is what we've always wanted.

27:08.900 --> 27:10.180
That's what everybody wants.

27:10.180 --> 27:11.220
Am I right fellas?

27:11.220 --> 27:12.580
No, no.

27:12.580 --> 27:13.060
Fellas.

27:13.620 --> 27:16.900
You know when he's that snake on the railing of the stairs?

27:16.900 --> 27:18.020
Makes your dick look like that.

27:18.020 --> 27:18.900
It's like that.

27:18.900 --> 27:20.100
Jump in, Delight.

27:20.100 --> 27:21.300
Talk your body on time.

27:21.300 --> 27:21.940
Okay.

27:21.940 --> 27:25.940
I got a pair that makes my dick look like the monster that Gina Davis turned into with

27:25.940 --> 27:28.500
the big open beak and the eyeballs in her mouth.

27:28.500 --> 27:35.380
I got one that makes my dick look like Jim Carrey from Earth Girls Are Easy with Gina Davis.

27:35.380 --> 27:38.180
I got one that looks like the cover of Earth Girls Are Easy.

27:38.180 --> 27:41.060
My dick looks like a spooky Winona Ryder.

27:43.380 --> 27:47.140
So if you go to meundies.com slash my brother.

27:47.140 --> 27:49.220
Do you guys think that's a reference to the room?

27:49.780 --> 27:50.980
Sydney and I were debating this.

27:50.980 --> 27:51.220
What?

27:51.220 --> 27:51.780
Meundies.

27:52.420 --> 27:52.660
No.

27:53.460 --> 27:53.860
No?

27:53.860 --> 27:54.420
Don't think.

27:54.420 --> 27:56.500
No, cause the line in the room is me under wears.

27:56.500 --> 27:57.060
Yeah.

27:57.060 --> 27:59.460
I know, but that's a long URL that they probably...

27:59.460 --> 28:06.740
Anyway, meundies.com slash my brother is gonna get you 20% off your first order and free

28:06.740 --> 28:07.140

28:16.900 --> 28:17.700
your first pair is free.

28:17.700 --> 28:18.740
I also guarantee.

28:18.740 --> 28:23.380
Yeah, and we're all dudes talking about it, but they have underpants for both ladies and

28:23.380 --> 28:23.860
dudes.

28:23.860 --> 28:26.020
They sent some to Sydney cause we're advertising them on Sawbones.

28:26.020 --> 28:27.220
She's crazy about it.

28:27.220 --> 28:30.580
Make your vagina look like a spooky Winona Ryder.

28:30.580 --> 28:31.860
And that's all I'm gonna say about it.

28:31.860 --> 28:38.420
meundies.com slash my brother is the address.

28:38.420 --> 28:39.060
Thank you.

28:39.060 --> 28:43.780
We have a new advertiser this week and I am so excited about it.

28:43.780 --> 28:45.060
It's like the coolest idea.

28:45.060 --> 28:45.540
I love it.

28:46.020 --> 28:47.300
Do you want me to tell you about it?

28:47.300 --> 28:47.860
Cause I will.

28:48.660 --> 28:48.900
Hit me.

28:48.900 --> 28:49.860
Just do a good job.

28:49.860 --> 28:50.500
Okay, I'll try.

28:50.500 --> 28:51.620
It's called Blue Apron.

28:51.620 --> 28:54.580
It's our first time with them and I just want to make sure it's a good one.

28:54.580 --> 28:55.540
It's called Blue Apron.

28:55.540 --> 28:57.060
And basically here's how it works.

28:57.860 --> 28:59.700
We all want to eat better.

28:59.700 --> 29:00.740
Everybody does.

29:00.740 --> 29:01.700
We all want to eat well.

29:02.260 --> 29:04.420
Also health conscious, right?

29:04.420 --> 29:06.900
But sometimes you get busy and you're like, oh, I don't have-

29:06.900 --> 29:09.780
The con is on right in 2015.

29:09.780 --> 29:14.740
And if you got to get your look right, if you want to scam like sexual prowess is like

29:14.740 --> 29:17.780
and just being physically sexually attractive is like one of your most valuable tools.

29:18.420 --> 29:19.140
For conning?

29:19.140 --> 29:20.100
As Sawyer.

29:20.100 --> 29:21.060
Yeah, for conning.

29:21.700 --> 29:22.580
Absolutely.

29:22.580 --> 29:24.980
That's why there's no uggos in Ocean's Eleven.

29:24.980 --> 29:25.540
That's not true.

29:25.540 --> 29:26.100
Think about it.

29:26.660 --> 29:28.820
Even even Carl Reiner, looker.

29:31.140 --> 29:32.500
Can we please read?

29:32.500 --> 29:33.060
All right.

29:33.060 --> 29:35.540
We were doing an ad and we were doing such a good job.

29:35.540 --> 29:38.180
And then we all took turns talking about how we fuck Carl Reiner.

29:39.380 --> 29:40.660
What happened?

29:40.660 --> 29:42.340
For $9.99 a meal-

29:42.340 --> 29:43.620
Welcome to the show, Blue Apron.

29:43.620 --> 29:45.540
You can get your money back on the way out.

29:46.340 --> 29:52.660
For $9.99 per meal, Blue Apron will send you a refrigerated box with the right high quality

29:52.660 --> 29:56.660
ingredients in the exact right proportions, simple step by step recipe instructions right

29:56.660 --> 30:00.100
to your door to make a meal that is fresh and delicious.

30:00.100 --> 30:03.300
And a fucking low cal, 500, 700 calories per serving.

30:03.300 --> 30:08.900
And you would never think that because good tasting food usually upwards of 14,000 calories.

30:08.900 --> 30:12.660
And you're probably sitting there thinking like, oh, is this like a weird like rice and,

30:12.660 --> 30:13.940
you know, vegetable stew thing?

30:13.940 --> 30:15.460
Like I would get it like Weight Watchers.

30:15.460 --> 30:16.580
No, how about this?

30:16.580 --> 30:18.500
Short rib burgers on pretzel buns.

30:19.140 --> 30:20.820
Kung Pao chicken tacos.

30:20.820 --> 30:22.180
Put that in your face.

30:22.180 --> 30:23.460
I don't know why I'm getting aggressive.

30:23.460 --> 30:29.780
Have a romantic dinner with Carl Reiner and then maybe afterwards you'll get some calf stuff.

30:29.780 --> 30:30.340
Thank you.

30:30.340 --> 30:32.420
Here's the fact, here's the fact of the matter.

30:32.420 --> 30:36.580
If you want to get healthy, one of the best things you can do for yourself is to cook at home.

30:36.580 --> 30:38.900
You have no, you ever tasted something good in a restaurant?

30:38.900 --> 30:39.940
You know, it's secret is butter.

30:39.940 --> 30:41.300
It's always butter.

30:41.300 --> 30:42.820
Guaranteed.

30:42.820 --> 30:45.300
So, so that is a healthy choice.

30:45.300 --> 30:45.860
And you know what?

30:45.860 --> 30:48.340
$9.99 per meal is, is already pretty good.

30:48.340 --> 30:52.500
But if you think about like how much it would cost to go to buy ingredients for a meal and

30:52.500 --> 30:56.500
what you won't use, like what you'll waste, guarantee you'll end up spending more than

30:56.500 --> 30:57.860
that buying ingredients for stuff.

30:57.860 --> 30:58.900
It's an amazing deal.

30:58.900 --> 31:00.260
So maybe you want to go check it out.

31:00.260 --> 31:01.300
Maybe you're just not sure yet.

31:01.300 --> 31:03.380
I don't know why not, but maybe you're not sure yet.

31:03.380 --> 31:04.020
Well, good news.

31:04.020 --> 31:08.420
Go to blue apron.com slash my brother and you'll get your first two meals free.

31:08.980 --> 31:11.380
So you can check out the menu, see what's on the menu this week.

31:11.380 --> 31:14.580
Get two meals for you by going to blue apron.com slash my brother.

31:14.580 --> 31:15.300
Go check it out.

31:15.300 --> 31:17.380
It's, it's a really, really cool service.

31:17.380 --> 31:20.740
I'm fucking legit going to do this as soon as we hang up this scape call.

31:20.740 --> 31:21.940
I got a message.

31:21.940 --> 31:25.300
I got a message for Kitty Bear and it's from Seagoat.

31:25.860 --> 31:28.980
Seagoat says a very happy birthday.

31:28.980 --> 31:33.140
I was going to do like an impression of a goat underwater, but then I thought it's too

31:33.140 --> 31:33.700
easy.

31:33.700 --> 31:37.060
So I, instead I elected to do nothing funny.

31:37.060 --> 31:42.580
Seagoat said a very happy birthday to the best wife a dummy like me could possibly ask

31:42.580 --> 31:43.140
for.

31:43.140 --> 31:48.100
I hope you have an unbelievably perfect year and most of all, thanks for vibing with me

31:48.100 --> 31:49.060
and keeping it real.

31:49.780 --> 31:56.740
Also fish and poos say happy B-day as well, but they are too cheap to chip in XOXO.

31:56.740 --> 32:02.660
And I imagine that's some sort of secret code that activates some sort of sleeper cell.

32:02.660 --> 32:05.540
But happy birthday to Kitty Bear.

32:05.540 --> 32:07.220
Can you just use the real names?

32:07.220 --> 32:10.100
I feel like I'm talking to a couple of angel fire websites.

32:10.100 --> 32:13.540
Those, those are their, those are their given names.

32:14.740 --> 32:17.300
I don't think that they are.

32:17.300 --> 32:18.020
Wait, let me check.

32:18.580 --> 32:19.060
Yeah, they are.

32:19.060 --> 32:20.420
Those are their Christian names.

32:20.420 --> 32:23.460
I don't think we've said one true thing this whole episode.

32:23.460 --> 32:25.300
No, we talked about Carl Reiner being attractive.

32:25.300 --> 32:26.500
He's super fuckable.

32:26.500 --> 32:29.700
I have another message for Joe Lee, Lee Fieri.

32:30.260 --> 32:30.980
Hold up.

32:30.980 --> 32:35.220
They provided a, a phonetic pronunciation and I'm still fucking it up.

32:35.220 --> 32:41.300
Joe Lee Fieri crushed it and it's from Greg, Sean, Ryan, and John.

32:41.860 --> 32:45.940
Greg, Sean, Ryan, and John say we'd like to wish a happy birthday to the world

32:45.940 --> 32:53.620
class graphic designer and overlord of felt, Joe Lee Fieri, though he bears the form of

32:53.620 --> 32:57.940
a roguishly handsome man of 29 years and claims November 6th for his birthday.

32:57.940 --> 33:03.140
He is in fact an immortal deity who has sworn never to leave his house of girders until

33:03.140 --> 33:06.500
his space seed has created a race of Superman.

33:06.500 --> 33:07.060
Correct.

33:07.060 --> 33:11.460
So all right, this is like our third or fourth deity that we've canonized on the show.

33:11.460 --> 33:12.020
So thanks.

33:12.020 --> 33:13.940
Welcome to the halls of honor, Joe.

33:13.940 --> 33:20.260
Uh, we will sing songs in your name and we will light braziers in your honor and we're

33:20.260 --> 33:21.780
going to burn stuff in those braziers.

33:21.780 --> 33:26.580
But when the time comes for the end of days, we will have to kill you to siphon your energy.

33:27.380 --> 33:28.340
We hope that's cool with you.

33:28.340 --> 33:28.820
It'll be worth it.

33:28.820 --> 33:29.940
We hope that's all right.

33:29.940 --> 33:30.820
Yeah, I feel it's an even trade.

33:30.820 --> 33:34.180
It's all right.

33:34.180 --> 33:39.140
I have to tell you guys before we move on back to the comedy, not that this hasn't been

33:39.140 --> 33:43.540
funny and we did that great Carl Reiner bit, went ahead and got my two free meals from

33:43.540 --> 33:44.900
Blue Apron while we've been sitting here.

33:45.540 --> 33:49.460
Got to tell you on the menu this week, Mexican style rice and beef casserole with black beans

33:49.460 --> 33:55.860
and Monterey Jack cheese, chicken malagatua nice soup with kohlrabi and basmati rice and

33:55.860 --> 33:59.620
pistachio crusted catfish with Israeli couscous, roasted fennel and orange salad.

33:59.620 --> 34:02.180
Mother don't mind if I fucking do.

34:02.180 --> 34:03.620
Those sound delicious.

34:03.620 --> 34:08.180
Also, Justin, do you feel that you were giving your undivided attention to Kitty Bear and

34:08.180 --> 34:10.500
to Joe while you were doing that?

34:10.500 --> 34:15.380
Guys, if I know anything about fucking Kitty Bear and Joe, it's that they would want me

34:15.380 --> 34:17.940
to not miss out on the Mexican style rice and beef casserole.

34:17.940 --> 34:19.940
It would have been there 15 minutes later.

34:20.740 --> 34:21.620
You're not going to get that.

34:23.380 --> 34:26.180
It's not like there's an expiration date on that website.

34:26.180 --> 34:26.900
You don't know that.

34:26.900 --> 34:28.420
You are fucking guessing.

34:28.420 --> 34:29.780
Hold on, let me look at the website.

34:29.780 --> 34:32.980
Yep, they're out of pistachio crusted catfish or whatever you said.

34:32.980 --> 34:34.660
You got the last one, Justin.

34:34.660 --> 34:35.780
Glad I caught on it.

34:35.780 --> 34:36.900
Totally worth it.

34:36.900 --> 34:38.500
So, happy birthday to Joe.

34:39.140 --> 34:39.700
It's too late.

34:39.700 --> 34:40.180
Happy birthday to-

34:40.180 --> 34:41.060
No, no, you missed it.

34:41.060 --> 34:41.620
It's too late.

34:42.180 --> 34:43.380
No, listen, let me get in here.

34:45.540 --> 34:46.420
Make room for Justin.

34:46.420 --> 34:48.660
They don't want to miss out on my special brand of humor.

34:48.660 --> 34:49.380
Hold on.

34:49.380 --> 34:50.740
Let me get something for you.

34:50.740 --> 34:53.300
Kitty Bear, it's like two animals together.

34:53.940 --> 34:56.740
Joe Le Fieri, kind of like Guy Fieri.

34:56.740 --> 35:02.900
Yeah, they specifically provided the phonetic pronunciation

35:02.900 --> 35:04.580
so that we wouldn't say Fieri.

35:05.700 --> 35:07.300
Griffin, go ahead and just edit those jokes in.

35:07.300 --> 35:08.340
I don't have to edit them in.

35:08.340 --> 35:09.220
They're already in the show.

35:11.540 --> 35:13.140
What a subpar product.

35:14.740 --> 35:16.740
I hope you choke on that fucking delicious

35:16.740 --> 35:18.980
pistachio crusted catfish, you piece of shit.

35:18.980 --> 35:19.860
You don't mean that.

35:20.420 --> 35:21.220
You don't mean that.

35:21.220 --> 35:22.500
This shows nothing without me.

35:22.500 --> 35:25.700
As the last two sponsored messages proved,

35:25.700 --> 35:29.220
this shows nothing without my attention as we went off the rails.

35:31.220 --> 35:34.180
I listen to Bullseye to be cooler and more cultured

35:34.180 --> 35:36.340
than the people who don't know about Bullseye yet.

35:36.340 --> 35:38.740
Of course, then I tell them about Bullseye,

35:38.740 --> 35:40.660
so it doesn't usually work for very long.

35:40.660 --> 35:44.820
Bullseye's your guide to what's good from MaximumFun.org and NPR.

35:46.820 --> 35:49.540
So I'm happily engaged to a wonderfully bearded

35:49.540 --> 35:52.820
So I'm happily engaged to a wonderfully bearded man.

35:52.820 --> 35:56.500
It's wonderful bearded man, but how delightfully bearded?

36:00.980 --> 36:03.540
I'm engaged to an inescapably bearded man.

36:04.500 --> 36:06.180
An unavoidably bearded man.

36:08.020 --> 36:11.140
We both love food and go out to eat often.

36:11.140 --> 36:13.540
This is great fun, except for one detail.

36:14.100 --> 36:15.860
Every time we go out to the restaurant,

36:15.860 --> 36:18.260
he has to leave at some point to use the bathroom.

36:18.260 --> 36:19.780
My dog.

36:21.380 --> 36:24.180
Except I often get pity looks from the wait staff,

36:24.180 --> 36:27.620
and sometimes they even ask if I've been ditched by my date.

36:27.620 --> 36:29.860
How do I avoid this unwanted attention?

36:30.580 --> 36:33.060
My boyfriend, my bathroom, and me in bold.

36:33.060 --> 36:35.060
How long is he gone?

36:35.060 --> 36:37.300
I thought that fucking beard was gonna come into it.

36:37.300 --> 36:39.700
Like you get soup in there and it's yucky.

36:39.700 --> 36:41.380
You dropped your own little red herring there.

36:41.380 --> 36:42.260
You did your own con.

36:43.380 --> 36:46.980
Sydney says that I can't go into a public place

36:46.980 --> 36:49.460
without using the bath, like if they have a bath.

36:49.460 --> 36:51.940
We've talked about this.

36:51.940 --> 36:52.580
I've gotta check it out.

36:52.580 --> 36:54.180
You always fucking keep your exits wide.

36:54.180 --> 36:56.980
You always slice the pie every time you go into a bin again.

36:56.980 --> 37:00.340
So you're like, excuse me, we need a table for two

37:00.340 --> 37:02.340
and I need a map of the facilities.

37:03.060 --> 37:04.740
I have gotten better about this.

37:04.740 --> 37:07.460
Here's what I think is fair from your perspective.

37:07.460 --> 37:08.740
I think it's fair to say, listen,

37:09.700 --> 37:12.740
I understand you wanna go in and make some room

37:12.740 --> 37:14.740
or wash your hands or whatever you're doing in there.

37:14.740 --> 37:19.540
Can you please just try to keep it like infill, ex-fill,

37:20.180 --> 37:24.340
super stealth, no scope, seal team six, in and out,

37:25.780 --> 37:28.100
and not leave me sitting at the table for ages.

37:28.100 --> 37:29.700
Or just leave your jacket on the chair.

37:30.660 --> 37:32.100
Can you just leave your jacket on the chair

37:32.100 --> 37:33.860
so people know you're coming back?

37:33.860 --> 37:36.980
Or a little note that says like, be back in five minutes.

37:37.780 --> 37:39.700
Bathroom and bathroom and again.

37:40.420 --> 37:42.740
Oh, maybe we just need like Oscar seat fillers.

37:42.740 --> 37:47.780
That, oh God, Travis, that's a really good idea.

37:47.780 --> 37:50.100
You can go to the bathroom for as long as you want,

37:50.100 --> 37:53.460
but to stand in for me, his name is Kyle Pearson.

37:53.460 --> 37:56.260
He's from Central Cast and he's handsomer than I am.

37:56.260 --> 37:58.340
He's ready to talk about whatever you wanna talk about.

37:59.220 --> 38:02.660
See, in 10 to 15, I had beans earlier.

38:03.940 --> 38:05.140
Can we not?

38:05.140 --> 38:07.860
I'm sorry, that got, it got cheap at the end there.

38:07.860 --> 38:09.060
I was trying to think of a meal

38:09.060 --> 38:10.580
that would make it difficult to poop.

38:10.580 --> 38:13.860
And a bunch of bubblegum and beans was all I had.

38:13.860 --> 38:16.100
Right, excuse me, excuse me.

38:16.100 --> 38:17.140
Is your boyfriend gone?

38:17.140 --> 38:19.700
No, he ate a lot of bubblegum earlier.

38:19.700 --> 38:20.660
Are you okay?

38:20.660 --> 38:24.180
He's having a rough time, but he's definitely real.

38:24.180 --> 38:25.380
He's very real.

38:25.380 --> 38:28.260
He eats bubblegum only.

38:28.980 --> 38:31.540
Bubblegum and string and it gets real rough down there.

38:32.340 --> 38:34.500
Do you think it's hard for aspiring actors

38:35.220 --> 38:38.500
working as waiters to see people getting solid work

38:38.500 --> 38:41.140
as bathroom seat fillers at restaurants?

38:41.140 --> 38:42.580
Like they can aspire to that?

38:42.580 --> 38:44.100
Like man, I love that.

38:44.100 --> 38:46.260
I bet they're really uppity and artsy about it

38:46.260 --> 38:47.860
and they're like, yeah, I could sell out

38:47.860 --> 38:50.420
and be a bathroom seat filler too,

38:50.420 --> 38:52.180
but I'm holding out, you know what I mean?

38:52.180 --> 38:54.340
Like, yeah, there was an audition

38:54.340 --> 38:56.820
and my agent tried to send me to be a bathroom seat filler,

38:56.820 --> 39:01.820
but I said, no, I'm gonna wait and be on NCIS New Orleans.

39:02.580 --> 39:03.940
Yeah, shoot for the stars.

39:04.820 --> 39:06.020
Which I just watched the other day

39:06.020 --> 39:07.620
and Bakla is so good in it.

39:07.620 --> 39:09.140
Yeah, of course he is.

39:10.020 --> 39:14.100
Bakla is Bakla in NCIS New Orleans.

39:14.100 --> 39:18.020
Did you guys know that the fucking sun came up this morning?

39:18.020 --> 39:19.220
As long as we're like talking about shit

39:19.220 --> 39:20.020
that everybody knows.

39:20.740 --> 39:22.820
Everybody knows that Bakla is gonna knock it out of the park.

39:24.340 --> 39:27.780
This is why Bakla is amazing at NCIS New Orleans, Griffin.

39:27.780 --> 39:29.700
Not only does he do a fine job,

39:29.700 --> 39:32.100
but at no point do you get the feeling

39:32.100 --> 39:35.060
that he's embarrassed to be on NCIS New Orleans.

39:35.060 --> 39:35.620
No, of course not.

39:35.620 --> 39:39.380
Like he's giving it not only his full talent,

39:39.380 --> 39:41.060
but his heart and soul.

39:41.060 --> 39:41.300
Yeah.

39:41.300 --> 39:43.060
And it was even a crossover episode

39:43.060 --> 39:45.220
with the people from NCIS Florida,

39:45.220 --> 39:48.020
I got whatever the NCIS progenitor was.

39:48.900 --> 39:51.220
It was a full crossover so that dude

39:51.220 --> 39:54.660
who played the awesome secret service agent in West Wing

39:54.660 --> 39:55.620
was there too.

39:55.620 --> 39:55.860
Yeah.

39:55.860 --> 39:57.620
And Bakla just outshone them all.

39:57.620 --> 39:58.500
Outshone them all.

39:58.500 --> 40:00.340
NCIS Vero Beach, Florida.

40:02.500 --> 40:04.100
That's the fucking Bakla guarantee.

40:04.100 --> 40:06.260
He puts his heart and soul into everything.

40:06.260 --> 40:07.780
If he were my seat filler.

40:07.780 --> 40:09.300
Well, first of all, if you were my seat filler,

40:09.300 --> 40:11.540
I would come back and oops, no wife.

40:11.540 --> 40:12.340
Wife's gone.

40:12.900 --> 40:14.900
Wife's gone, Bakla's gone, car's gone.

40:14.900 --> 40:16.580
House is gone, life is gone.

40:16.580 --> 40:17.460
Family gone.

40:18.020 --> 40:18.500
Future.

40:18.500 --> 40:19.860
He 20'd off-teamed you.

40:19.860 --> 40:21.140
Oh, I got conned.

40:21.140 --> 40:22.820
Only it didn't take a whole year, did it?

40:22.820 --> 40:24.020
It took 14 seconds.

40:24.020 --> 40:24.900
Are you Scott Bakula?

40:24.900 --> 40:25.380
Yes.

40:25.380 --> 40:26.020
Are you sure?

40:26.020 --> 40:26.580
Yes.

40:26.580 --> 40:29.300
Do your NCIS New Orleans accent for me.

40:29.300 --> 40:30.260
You're a high-other.

40:30.260 --> 40:31.060
Oh, okay.

40:31.060 --> 40:31.860
To the car.

40:31.860 --> 40:32.340
Come on.

40:32.340 --> 40:33.460
We can make love on the way.

40:33.460 --> 40:34.420
We can make love on the way.

40:34.420 --> 40:35.940
I will say thank you the whole time.

40:35.940 --> 40:36.660
I will say thank you.

40:36.660 --> 40:37.380
On the way to where?

40:37.380 --> 40:38.500
Wherever.

40:38.500 --> 40:39.380
Take me wherever.

40:39.380 --> 40:40.420
Take me to New Orleans.

40:40.420 --> 40:42.820
My life with Griffin is over now.

40:44.420 --> 40:45.860
It was good while it lasted,

40:45.860 --> 40:48.020
but you're Scott fucking Bakula.

40:48.020 --> 40:53.380
Can I just say the greatest guesspert get?

40:53.380 --> 40:54.100
Don't, don't say it.

40:54.100 --> 40:54.500
Don't say it.

40:54.500 --> 40:55.300
Don't even jinx it.

40:55.300 --> 40:56.020
Don't even jinx it.

40:56.740 --> 41:00.660
Fucking 2015, Bakula, if you're out there,

41:00.660 --> 41:01.300
and I know you are.

41:01.300 --> 41:02.420
So you're saying it.

41:02.420 --> 41:02.820
Please.

41:02.820 --> 41:03.700
You're just saying it now.

41:04.740 --> 41:05.780
What's wrong with saying it?

41:05.780 --> 41:06.820
You're just doing jinx it.

41:08.100 --> 41:09.780
Don't you guys know how the fucking secret works?

41:09.780 --> 41:10.580
Law of attraction.

41:10.580 --> 41:11.540
You write down a secret.

41:11.540 --> 41:12.820
You bury it in your yard.

41:12.820 --> 41:14.660
You hand it to Scott Bakula.

41:14.660 --> 41:16.420
You got to put the vibe out into the universe.

41:16.980 --> 41:17.480
Okay.

41:18.500 --> 41:19.000
Okay.

41:19.940 --> 41:21.380
Do you guys want to know Yahoo?

41:21.380 --> 41:21.860
Yes, please.

41:21.860 --> 41:22.340
Please.

41:22.340 --> 41:22.820
It's Yahoo.

41:22.820 --> 41:24.660
It was sent in by Jesse Stanchak.

41:24.660 --> 41:25.300
Thank you, Jesse.

41:25.300 --> 41:26.740
It's by Yahoo Answers user Matt,

41:27.780 --> 41:30.260
who has a 100% best answers rating.

41:30.260 --> 41:32.740
So we're dealing with banking royalty.

41:32.740 --> 41:33.300
Here.

41:33.300 --> 41:35.300
Matt doesn't step into the game very often,

41:35.300 --> 41:38.020
but when he does, he crushes it.

41:38.020 --> 41:39.300
In fact, he only-

41:39.300 --> 41:41.700
He's from an alternate reality Yahoo Answers

41:41.700 --> 41:44.580
where people only answer if they have a fucking answer

41:44.580 --> 41:45.940
to answer the thing with.

41:47.780 --> 41:48.980
Anyway, Matt asks,

41:50.260 --> 41:51.700
with all of his infinite wisdom,

41:52.740 --> 41:54.340
astral projection sex?

41:55.540 --> 41:57.540
And then in parentheses, noob question.

41:58.260 --> 41:59.220
I'm noob.

41:59.220 --> 42:03.860
I'm a noob to astrally projecting myself into sex situations.

42:04.980 --> 42:07.780
I would like to try to have an out of body experience.

42:08.900 --> 42:11.220
I've been reading about astral sex.

42:11.220 --> 42:13.460
More like an into body experience.

42:13.460 --> 42:13.940
Stop it.

42:14.500 --> 42:15.000
Okay.

42:15.940 --> 42:17.300
No, you can keep doing it.

42:17.300 --> 42:18.180
Okay, thank you.

42:18.900 --> 42:20.100
I've been reading about astral-

42:20.100 --> 42:21.540
Because what I was saying was like,

42:21.540 --> 42:23.060
you're going into someone's body.

42:23.060 --> 42:23.940
Yep, yep.

42:23.940 --> 42:26.180
I've been reading about astral sex

42:26.180 --> 42:29.220
and that if you have astral sex with say,

42:29.220 --> 42:30.820
someone like your crush,

42:30.820 --> 42:33.940
they will dream about you sexually in the physical world.

42:33.940 --> 42:34.820
Hold up.

42:34.820 --> 42:37.620
Wait, if you have sex with them astrally,

42:37.620 --> 42:41.140
they'll dream about you sexually in the physical world.

42:41.140 --> 42:42.500
Okay, now I'm on board again.

42:42.500 --> 42:42.820
Got it.

42:42.820 --> 42:43.780
All makes sense.

42:43.780 --> 42:46.260
I see this as impossible,

42:46.900 --> 42:49.060
but yet I read it happens.

42:49.060 --> 42:50.260
So is this possible?

42:50.820 --> 42:55.300
So this is this person's first astral experience

42:55.300 --> 42:57.540
and they think just out the gate,

42:57.540 --> 43:00.660
they're going to leave their body into the fucking ether

43:00.660 --> 43:02.100
and then be fucking up there?

43:02.100 --> 43:04.020
No, you got to walk before you can run

43:04.020 --> 43:05.140
before you can have sex.

43:05.140 --> 43:07.700
You have to astrally hold hands first.

43:07.700 --> 43:08.260
Right.

43:08.260 --> 43:10.260
Well, you have to astrally develop hands.

43:10.260 --> 43:13.700
You're just going to be sort of an amorphous swarm

43:13.700 --> 43:15.140
of thoughts up there.

43:15.140 --> 43:16.580
Can I just say that like,

43:17.220 --> 43:20.580
it beautifully sums up people on the internet

43:20.580 --> 43:21.700
to say the sentence,

43:21.700 --> 43:23.220
I don't think this is true,

43:23.220 --> 43:26.100
but then I read that it was.

43:26.100 --> 43:27.380
So is it?

43:27.380 --> 43:27.780
Is it?

43:28.580 --> 43:30.500
You know, every time you have deja vu,

43:31.060 --> 43:34.420
that means that someone just had astral projection sex with you

43:34.420 --> 43:35.620
while watching the matrix?

43:36.340 --> 43:37.540
Suck on that copper top.

43:41.540 --> 43:41.940
I don't.

43:42.740 --> 43:43.220
I got it.

43:44.020 --> 43:49.620
This has to be two people projecting themselves, right?

43:49.620 --> 43:51.300
Because you can't just like astrally project

43:51.300 --> 43:53.140
of fit.

43:53.140 --> 43:58.340
You can't manifest physical change in the material realm

43:58.900 --> 44:02.020
when you are just a fucking thought swarm up there in the ether.

44:02.980 --> 44:08.900
So you have to be with somebody else's astral existence

44:08.900 --> 44:11.380
and then fucking them and they're fucking you.

44:11.380 --> 44:12.820
And then it's a very cordial thank you.

44:12.820 --> 44:13.220
Thank you.

44:13.220 --> 44:15.700
Use it back into your bodies before midnight

44:15.700 --> 44:17.860
or else you are going to stay the animal

44:17.860 --> 44:19.300
that you anamorphed into forever.

44:19.300 --> 44:19.620
Correct.

44:19.620 --> 44:21.780
Correct, correct.

44:21.780 --> 44:22.980
My question is this.

44:22.980 --> 44:24.900
The end result of this, like, you know-

44:24.900 --> 44:26.180
You have all question.

44:26.180 --> 44:26.980
Yes, just to clarify.

44:26.980 --> 44:29.060
Everything else, totally clear.

44:29.060 --> 44:29.380
The end result of this-

44:29.380 --> 44:31.460
Was it the anamorphs thing that you got lost in?

44:31.460 --> 44:33.140
Cause it got a little tangly.

44:33.140 --> 44:34.100
No, I followed that.

44:35.220 --> 44:36.420
If you do this, right?

44:36.420 --> 44:37.860
I'm trying to follow the chain here.

44:37.860 --> 44:40.580
You astrally project have sex with someone, right?

44:40.580 --> 44:44.660
Then they dream about it because you're astrally fucking them

44:44.660 --> 44:46.420
and they're dreaming about it.

44:46.420 --> 44:49.300
Is the hope that then the next day they walk up to you and go,

44:49.300 --> 44:50.980
hey, this is going to sound weird,

44:50.980 --> 44:54.180
but I dreamed last night that we fucked

44:54.180 --> 44:57.300
and it was so, so good that I want to do it in RL.

44:58.260 --> 45:01.380
So the partner who's not astrally projecting is dreaming.

45:01.380 --> 45:03.300
They're not also astrally projecting.

45:03.300 --> 45:05.060
That's not, it's two different realms.

45:05.060 --> 45:07.060
The dream realm and the astral realm.

45:07.060 --> 45:08.340
Are you fucking kidding me?

45:08.340 --> 45:10.900
Wait, so are you astrally projecting into their dream?

45:11.460 --> 45:12.420
You can't do that.

45:12.420 --> 45:13.460
That's science fiction.

45:15.460 --> 45:15.860
I have a very-

45:15.860 --> 45:17.380
So you're astrally projecting,

45:17.380 --> 45:20.340
having sex with their essence?

45:20.340 --> 45:21.940
Yeah, their astral essence.

45:21.940 --> 45:24.980
It has to be, listen, we're getting into semantics now.

45:24.980 --> 45:27.220
I have a much more important question for us.

45:27.220 --> 45:27.540
Okay.

45:27.540 --> 45:30.980
To all ponder, to really put into our thoughts for a while.

45:31.700 --> 45:35.220
Say you anamorph into a lion.

45:36.980 --> 45:38.500
Are you both paying attention?

45:38.500 --> 45:39.620
Yeah, so on it.

45:39.620 --> 45:40.900
It's really important.

45:40.900 --> 45:43.060
Okay, I'll stop ordering my blue apron meals.

45:43.060 --> 45:44.180
Yeah, put that away for a second.

45:44.180 --> 45:44.740
Close the tab.

45:44.740 --> 45:50.660
Okay, you anamorph into a lion for an animorse mission

45:51.540 --> 45:55.860
and you accidentally stay morphed for over two hours.

45:55.860 --> 45:56.340
Okay.

45:56.340 --> 45:59.060
And when you do that, you're that animal just for life.

45:59.060 --> 45:59.860
Correct.

45:59.860 --> 46:01.380
That is what happened to Tobias.

46:01.380 --> 46:04.500
Tobias done turned into a fucking hawk because he's a dummy

46:04.500 --> 46:05.780
and he didn't look at his fucking hawk.

46:05.780 --> 46:07.780
No, he had to stay hidden up in the rafters

46:07.780 --> 46:09.460
or else he was gonna get caught, Griffin.

46:09.460 --> 46:11.460
You're a lion now for life.

46:12.020 --> 46:12.260
Okay.

46:12.260 --> 46:15.140
And you got other animorphs buddies who are more responsible

46:15.140 --> 46:15.460
than you.

46:15.460 --> 46:18.340
They can turn human and they know like, oh, man.

46:18.980 --> 46:20.900
Oh, Steven, he's a lion now.

46:20.900 --> 46:21.620
Leo.

46:21.620 --> 46:22.500
No, that's too easy.

46:23.620 --> 46:25.060
Lion-O, he's a lion now.

46:25.060 --> 46:26.820
Steven, he's a lion now.

46:26.820 --> 46:29.140
And you're still lying and they come to visit like,

46:29.140 --> 46:30.340
hey, Steven, you're like,

46:31.540 --> 46:33.380
because you're a lion.

46:33.380 --> 46:34.900
Growl, growl, growl, beef, beef, beef.

46:34.900 --> 46:42.820
My question is what is the length of time you have to go

46:43.700 --> 46:46.740
before you can start fucking lions?

46:46.740 --> 46:49.460
Because you've been a human this whole time and you're human.

46:51.140 --> 46:54.020
Your rolling crew, your animorphs road dogs,

46:54.820 --> 46:58.660
fucking know that you used to be a dude

46:58.660 --> 47:00.820
and now you're fucking lions.

47:00.820 --> 47:01.780
Well, Griffin.

47:01.780 --> 47:02.660
What's the length of time?

47:02.660 --> 47:04.340
What's the comfort zone there?

47:04.340 --> 47:04.820
Griffin.

47:05.380 --> 47:07.940
There is a time, because what happens to Tobias is

47:07.940 --> 47:10.420
eventually his humanity starts to slip away

47:10.420 --> 47:12.260
and he starts to like actually hunt

47:12.260 --> 47:15.140
and like become more of a hawk type of person.

47:15.140 --> 47:19.060
So, or that's Tobias wanting to fuck some hawks

47:19.060 --> 47:21.300
and saying like, oh, I guess I just really became a hawk.

47:21.300 --> 47:22.100
Oh, no, it's what?

47:22.100 --> 47:23.060
Oh, animal instincts.

47:23.060 --> 47:23.620
I don't know.

47:23.620 --> 47:24.820
Gosh, I'm losing my humanity.

47:24.820 --> 47:25.300
Be right back.

47:27.940 --> 47:29.460
Fucking thank you.

47:29.460 --> 47:31.060
Oh, my God.

47:31.060 --> 47:32.100
I'm gonna lay an egg.

47:32.100 --> 47:34.820
Is that how it works?

47:34.820 --> 47:35.940
It took me.

47:35.940 --> 47:39.220
It took me roughly two decades to figure out

47:39.220 --> 47:42.180
if human women wanted to have sex with me.

47:42.180 --> 47:46.020
So I think it's pretty fucking like optimistic to think

47:46.020 --> 47:48.580
I'm gonna jump into the lion world midstream.

47:48.580 --> 47:51.140
Be like, son, new to the game.

47:51.140 --> 47:54.260
And it'll be my decision.

47:54.260 --> 47:56.020
All on the prowl and ready to growl.

47:56.020 --> 47:56.900
Come on, ladies.

47:56.900 --> 47:57.540
Yeah.

47:57.540 --> 47:58.900
Hey, good news, ladies.

47:58.900 --> 48:02.420
I'm a really shitty lion who's ready to fucking clown.

48:03.380 --> 48:05.220
Don't ask me to hunt or do anything

48:05.220 --> 48:06.980
or do like any of the mating rituals.

48:06.980 --> 48:08.420
I don't know any of that shit.

48:08.420 --> 48:11.060
I just wanna get up on that.

48:11.060 --> 48:13.220
You know that someone's gonna see Steve

48:13.220 --> 48:14.660
and make this lion transformation

48:14.660 --> 48:16.900
and get all the fucking lion play,

48:17.460 --> 48:20.500
all the fucking feline action he could ever hope for.

48:20.500 --> 48:22.660
And then all of a sudden, maybe a week later,

48:22.660 --> 48:24.260
oh, what happened to Mark?

48:24.260 --> 48:26.180
Mark, you stayed over two hours.

48:26.180 --> 48:28.740
Whoops, guess I'm a deer forever.

48:28.740 --> 48:30.100
Mark, hurry and change back.

48:30.100 --> 48:31.620
It's been an hour and 58 minutes.

48:32.500 --> 48:33.540
Yeah, okay, let me try.

48:33.540 --> 48:34.820
Ooh, weird, it's not working.

48:34.820 --> 48:35.940
You must've set your watch wrong.

48:35.940 --> 48:36.580
Be right back.

48:40.420 --> 48:44.180
I mean, on the one side, you're a lion

48:44.180 --> 48:45.780
who knows none of the mating rituals.

48:45.780 --> 48:48.820
On the plus side, you do have an ATM card.

48:48.820 --> 48:50.660
And you can drive a car.

48:50.660 --> 48:52.740
You can drive a car and buy as much meat

48:52.740 --> 48:54.180
for the other lions as you want,

48:54.180 --> 48:55.700
which is a pretty powerful move.

48:55.700 --> 48:56.200
Yeah.

48:56.200 --> 48:59.640
The hardest part about picking up female lions

48:59.640 --> 49:01.160
is how do you neg them?

49:01.160 --> 49:02.040
What do you say?

49:02.040 --> 49:03.720
They're perfect and sinewy.

49:03.720 --> 49:05.160
They're perfect sinewy beautiful.

49:05.160 --> 49:06.840
There's nothing you could take away from them.

49:06.840 --> 49:09.080
Hey, fat haunches, get over here.

49:09.080 --> 49:11.080
Nothing, you have nothing on them.

49:11.080 --> 49:12.680
They're perfect killing machines.

49:12.680 --> 49:15.080
I guess I just think your jaws are too powerful.

49:16.520 --> 49:17.880
Like your whiskers.

49:17.880 --> 49:19.880
No, wait, I don't like your whiskers.

49:19.880 --> 49:21.000
Are we having sex?

49:22.600 --> 49:23.320
Us?

49:23.320 --> 49:25.720
Are you a former anamorph that got trapped in,

49:25.720 --> 49:26.840
oh, nope, just a lion.

49:26.840 --> 49:27.880
Okay, you can never tell.

49:29.800 --> 49:31.800
This has been our show, my brother, my brother and me.

49:31.800 --> 49:34.120
We hope you've had some lofts.

49:34.120 --> 49:35.960
Also hope this isn't your first episode.

49:36.920 --> 49:37.420
Woof.

49:38.280 --> 49:42.360
So we live shows coming to a town near you in 2015.

49:43.080 --> 49:45.160
We're doing a show in LA that sold out,

49:45.160 --> 49:49.080
but we are doing another show at San Francisco Sketch Fest.

49:49.720 --> 49:51.640
I believe tickets for that are still available.

49:51.640 --> 49:53.080
That's with JJ Go.

49:53.080 --> 49:57.480
So you're getting a pretty great value for that.

49:57.480 --> 50:01.320
That's February 7th at 1pm at Cobbs Comedy Club.

50:01.320 --> 50:06.280
You can get seats right for that show at the address

50:06.280 --> 50:09.560
bit.ly forward slash MBMBAM Sketch Fest.

50:10.520 --> 50:12.920
Also, we've got new live shows coming out.

50:12.920 --> 50:14.680
Like Justin said, we're going to announce those next week.

50:14.680 --> 50:17.160
So make sure you tune into the Twitter

50:17.160 --> 50:18.200
and you tune into the show.

50:18.840 --> 50:20.360
Also, if you're listening to this,

50:20.360 --> 50:22.440
either on the day it comes out or the day after,

50:22.440 --> 50:25.160
so the 5th or 6th, on the 6th,

50:25.160 --> 50:28.360
we have me and Andy are doing a Bunker Buddies live show

50:28.360 --> 50:32.840
with Jordan Jesse Go at UCB Franklin at 11pm.

50:33.640 --> 50:34.840
And tickets for that are still available.

50:34.840 --> 50:37.080
They're only $5 and we really want to see you there.

50:37.080 --> 50:39.240
This is the first Max Fund Presents

50:39.240 --> 50:41.560
and we want to do more at the UCB.

50:41.560 --> 50:43.960
So we really appreciate you guys coming out and supporting us.

50:43.960 --> 50:48.840
You can get tickets for that at bit.ly forward slash BBJJGO LA.

50:48.840 --> 50:51.000
All lowercase and we really want to see you out there.

50:51.000 --> 50:52.760
It can be uppercase too, Travis.

50:52.760 --> 50:53.320
Oh, sure.

50:53.320 --> 50:53.720
Okay.

50:53.720 --> 50:55.240
And actually, it actually can't.

50:55.240 --> 50:56.280
We fucked around with that.

50:56.280 --> 50:57.080
You're kidding me.

50:57.080 --> 50:58.920
Before, you know, it's case sensitive.

50:58.920 --> 51:00.040
What the fuck, internet?

51:00.040 --> 51:01.400
You changed overnight.

51:02.360 --> 51:04.040
Speaking of Bunker Buddies and Jordan Jesse Go,

51:04.040 --> 51:06.840
go check out all the other Maximum Fun.org shows.

51:06.840 --> 51:07.160
They're all incredible.

51:07.160 --> 51:10.680
Let's do a special plug for the Adventure Zone

51:10.680 --> 51:12.920
because several people will tell us

51:12.920 --> 51:14.120
every time a new episode is released

51:14.120 --> 51:16.360
that they didn't know we were doing this.

51:16.360 --> 51:24.200
We do a D&D fantasy adventure with our daddy, Clint,

51:25.720 --> 51:29.400
where we, you know, basically just play D&D and you listen.

51:29.400 --> 51:31.880
And people have been really, really nice about the show.

51:31.880 --> 51:33.960
It's our most popular show by far.

51:33.960 --> 51:36.200
It is one day going to supersede my bim bam

51:36.200 --> 51:38.360
and become the flagship of the empire.

51:38.360 --> 51:39.000
Believe that.

51:39.560 --> 51:41.480
So go look for the Adventure Zone on iTunes,

51:41.480 --> 51:43.080
subscribe to it, rate it, review it if you can.

51:43.080 --> 51:45.160
You know where they can fucking find it?

51:45.160 --> 51:46.520
At the-

51:46.520 --> 51:48.120
At theadventure.zone.

51:48.120 --> 51:49.640

51:52.600 --> 51:53.800

51:53.800 --> 51:57.800
There's a dude, Leon Rosilar, I believe is his name,

51:57.800 --> 52:01.160
who's done art for the past two episodes.

52:01.160 --> 52:03.160
That is like a summary of the episodes

52:03.160 --> 52:04.600
and they're fucking incredible.

52:04.600 --> 52:06.520
You can find those at theadventure.zone

52:07.640 --> 52:08.680

52:08.680 --> 52:09.160

52:09.160 --> 52:10.520
If you could tweet also,

52:10.520 --> 52:13.480
if you get into D&D as a result of our show,

52:13.480 --> 52:16.440
please tweet at Wizards of the Coast

52:16.440 --> 52:19.800
just to say like, hey, you know, I'm into this

52:19.800 --> 52:22.200
because maybe they'll tweet about our show

52:22.200 --> 52:24.600
and then we'll get famous and maybe get free shit.

52:24.600 --> 52:26.440
We also want to say thanks again to MeUndies

52:26.440 --> 52:27.240

52:38.680 --> 52:42.200
as his character, Merle Highchurch, at our holiday show.

52:42.200 --> 52:43.480
Don't miss that.

52:52.760 --> 52:53.560
Get all that stuff.

52:53.560 --> 52:55.320
Big thanks to the Long Winters

52:55.320 --> 52:56.280
for the use of our theme song,

52:56.280 --> 52:58.600
It's a Departure, off the album Putting the Days to Bed.

53:00.200 --> 53:02.360
It's a great, great album, great song,

53:02.360 --> 53:05.240
great music, great friends, great times, great-

53:06.280 --> 53:07.160
Good brews.

53:07.160 --> 53:09.480
Great summer, great summer party times

53:09.480 --> 53:13.320
and just like the best spring break I've ever been on.

53:13.320 --> 53:13.820
Yeah.

53:16.360 --> 53:17.000
Is that it?

53:17.000 --> 53:17.480
Is that everything?

53:17.480 --> 53:18.440
We got a new animated short,

53:18.440 --> 53:19.160
Grift of the Magi.

53:19.160 --> 53:20.120
It's on our YouTube channel.

53:20.920 --> 53:22.600
YouTube.com slash NBNBAM.

53:22.600 --> 53:23.080
You can find it there.

53:23.080 --> 53:24.760
Go subscribe and rate and review that

53:24.760 --> 53:25.880
and share it with people.

53:25.880 --> 53:27.720
It's a really good way if you've been trying to figure out

53:27.720 --> 53:29.400
how to get other people into it.

53:29.400 --> 53:33.160
I think those cartoons made by our boy Tyler Crowley

53:33.160 --> 53:35.880
are a pretty good way of getting people into the show.

53:35.880 --> 53:37.480
So go check this out.

53:37.480 --> 53:40.280
I think it's everything.

53:40.280 --> 53:42.760
Grift, do you have a last Yahoo answer for us?

53:42.760 --> 53:43.480
Yeah.

53:43.480 --> 53:46.440
This final Yahoo answer was sent in by game recognized game,

53:46.440 --> 53:47.160
Rachel Sperling.

53:47.160 --> 53:47.800
Thank you, Rachel.

53:48.520 --> 53:51.320
It's by Yahoo answers user K who asks,

53:53.080 --> 53:55.720
Does fish oil make your booty pop?

53:58.680 --> 53:59.640
I'm Justin McElroy.

53:59.640 --> 54:01.080
I'm Travis McElroy.

54:39.080 --> 54:41.160
Did you, the listener, like that?

54:41.160 --> 54:44.200
You were just swept up in a world of high fantasy and magic

54:44.200 --> 54:46.680
where anything can happen and anything is possible.

54:46.680 --> 54:49.560
I am Griffin McElroy, dungeon master for the Adventure Zone,

55:00.520 --> 55:06.440
