00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:46.560
Hello, everybody. Welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me,

00:46.560 --> 00:49.760
an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

00:49.760 --> 00:52.000
I'm your middle brother, Travis McElroy.

00:52.000 --> 00:56.480
I'm the mystical, magical, illusionist, entertainer, David Blaine.

00:56.480 --> 00:59.520
David, so happy to have you here. Wow, what an honor.

00:59.520 --> 01:05.440
Sorry, I got delayed by some crosswinds over Milwaukee,

01:05.440 --> 01:08.800
and so it delayed me coming into the studio today.

01:08.800 --> 01:15.840
Just a few days after your dramatic ascent, holding a lot of balloons,

01:16.880 --> 01:18.880
upping yourself is what the kids call it.

01:18.880 --> 01:25.200
Yeah, I did an up, and it was an exhilarating journey that brought the country together,

01:25.200 --> 01:32.960
and it was an illusion, and also I liked doing it a lot, and I had a lot of fun doing it.

01:32.960 --> 01:35.760
So that's the only means of conveyance you're using.

01:35.760 --> 01:39.520
So now I do it all the time, because when you get on an airplane,

01:40.960 --> 01:45.440
they aren't doing a great job of the social distancing.

01:45.440 --> 01:46.720
Have you guys heard about this?

01:48.000 --> 01:48.320
No.

01:48.320 --> 01:56.800
You might have been, David, you got up to 24,900 feet.

01:59.040 --> 02:02.480
You must have been the most socially distanced person on the planet.

02:02.480 --> 02:08.320
Well, I was until one of my balloons popped and it released the stinky breath of a sick man.

02:10.560 --> 02:14.880
The balloons were all blown up by a big man with powerful breath,

02:14.880 --> 02:19.040
and I found out later he was sick with it.

02:19.040 --> 02:19.920
So I don't know.

02:19.920 --> 02:23.440
It was, again, the crosswinds may have diluted it somewhat.

02:24.400 --> 02:26.960
That may have been smilex gas.

02:26.960 --> 02:28.480
You know how the Joker do.

02:29.120 --> 02:31.360
The Joker's always on my nuts.

02:32.400 --> 02:37.440
Can I give you, I just want to say thank you, Mr. Blaine,

02:37.440 --> 02:48.000
because it is amazing how your balloon trip captivated the hearts and minds of everyone.

02:48.000 --> 02:54.800
And for days now, it's all anyone has been talking about across all social.

02:54.800 --> 02:56.800
It's literally the only thing being discussed.

02:56.800 --> 03:01.920
It is, I think, the first thing that has distracted everyone from everything.

03:01.920 --> 03:02.800
It's amazing.

03:02.800 --> 03:09.200
I actually, as interested as I'm here to hear him to hear about David's experience with the balloon,

03:09.200 --> 03:10.880
I'd like to talk about my experience,

03:11.520 --> 03:20.960
which is I saw on Twitter about a half hour after it ended that it had happened.

03:21.680 --> 03:23.840
I was like, oh, man, I didn't fucking hear about that.

03:23.840 --> 03:24.480
He did what?

03:25.360 --> 03:31.360
I like to pretend that David Blaine was like, if I could tell him that personally,

03:31.360 --> 03:35.680
like, I know you went up in the air with balloons you're holding,

03:35.680 --> 03:38.640
but I didn't find out about it till later and I couldn't be bothered.

03:38.640 --> 03:43.760
And then David, by the way, when I did watch it, I did skip around quite a bit.

03:43.760 --> 03:48.320
Your journey and your ascension and decline, even your falling,

03:48.320 --> 03:50.720
even your falling through the fucking air.

03:50.720 --> 03:51.840
I was like, eh.

03:51.840 --> 03:52.800
It took a minute.

03:52.800 --> 03:54.480
David, can I ask, because it kind of seems to be-

03:54.480 --> 03:58.560
Wow, you sure aren't really giving me room to speak about my incredible sky journey.

03:58.560 --> 03:58.800
I'm sure you guys have been up to this.

03:58.800 --> 04:00.400
No, because I do want to hear about it.

04:00.400 --> 04:01.360
I do, David.

04:01.360 --> 04:01.920
Yeah.

04:01.920 --> 04:02.560
David, I do.

04:02.560 --> 04:08.000
But to Justin's point, it kind of seems to me like maybe that unlike,

04:08.000 --> 04:12.000
you know, where you sat in a big fish bowl for a long time,

04:12.560 --> 04:17.760
or you claimed to be frozen in ice, even though our daddy did that, and you-

04:17.760 --> 04:20.320
Oh, wait, you're Clint's kids.

04:20.320 --> 04:23.520
Yeah, yeah, yeah, the creator of the frozen in ice gag.

04:25.120 --> 04:29.440
It kind of seems like this one wasn't like a publicity thing,

04:29.440 --> 04:32.640
so much as it was just something you were going to do on your own,

04:32.640 --> 04:35.200
and somebody noticed and pointed a camera at you.

04:35.760 --> 04:38.800
It didn't seem like it was advertised in any way beforehand.

04:38.800 --> 04:39.360
Is that true?

04:40.000 --> 04:43.680
No, but we did a sort of street team advertisement.

04:43.680 --> 04:49.200
But with the balloon, we tied it, like with the URL, we put it on some paper,

04:49.200 --> 04:50.480
and we tied it to balloons.

04:50.480 --> 04:54.320
But wouldn't you know it, the Dagnab things dang did flew up into the sky,

04:54.320 --> 04:55.440
so no one could see them.

04:55.440 --> 04:59.040
Um, David, I'd like to talk about one feature of your stunt

04:59.040 --> 05:01.040
that I thought was so captivating.

05:01.040 --> 05:01.680
Good.

05:01.680 --> 05:07.440
Um, you're- I believe there's a young woman there who I believe was your daughter.

05:07.440 --> 05:09.520
I don't know for sure.

05:09.520 --> 05:10.880
Me neither, me neither.

05:10.880 --> 05:17.280
But she attached the final balloon that began your ascent into the sky.

05:17.280 --> 05:18.320
Put me over.

05:18.320 --> 05:19.360
Yeah, put you over.

05:19.360 --> 05:20.880
That was so lovely.

05:20.880 --> 05:24.080
I wanted to know, did you consider the fact that if something

05:24.080 --> 05:29.040
did go terribly wrong, she would have like YouTube live streamed evidence

05:29.040 --> 05:31.600
that she could revisit for the rest of her existence?

05:31.600 --> 05:35.120
Of that time, she killed her dad with a balloon.

05:35.680 --> 05:37.680
Did you think about that outcome?

05:37.680 --> 05:39.440
It's a part of the illusion, isn't it?

05:39.440 --> 05:40.560
Well, there's no illusion.

05:40.560 --> 05:43.200
No, whoa, you're very clear about this.

05:43.200 --> 05:44.880
That was you in the balloons, right?

05:44.880 --> 05:49.600
Unless, unless that was the trick, that was you in the balloons, right?

05:49.600 --> 05:52.640
I never give it away, my secrets.

05:52.640 --> 05:54.400
Okay.

05:54.400 --> 05:58.320
I had an invisible, it was a very big ladder.

05:58.960 --> 05:59.600
There were some people-

05:59.600 --> 06:01.600
Oh, wait, hold on, Justin.

06:01.600 --> 06:04.080
I want to hear more about this giant invisible ladder technology.

06:04.080 --> 06:04.320
Okay.

06:04.320 --> 06:08.000
It was big, it was a big ladder, 10,000 foot ladder.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.680
I didn't even get up the whole deck thing.

06:11.760 --> 06:15.680
In these times when things are changing so much, I would like to repeat

06:15.680 --> 06:17.680
a little bit of consistency in the world.

06:17.680 --> 06:26.560
I showed your stunt to my wife who reacted the way she has reacted

06:26.560 --> 06:30.160
to all of your stunts for the past decade.

06:30.160 --> 06:33.360
She watched in silence and then said, that fucking idiot.

06:33.360 --> 06:36.000
Well, every single time, David.

06:36.000 --> 06:39.280
Well, it hurts my feelings, or does it?

06:42.720 --> 06:44.080
What did Leo think of this?

06:44.880 --> 06:46.400
Leo loved it.

06:46.400 --> 06:47.920
I'm not sure who you're referring to.

06:47.920 --> 06:50.320
DiCaprio, your friend, Leo DiCaprio.

06:50.320 --> 06:52.080
You're friends with a lot of celebs.

06:52.080 --> 06:53.680
Yeah, he liked it one time.

06:56.240 --> 06:59.280
He had a watch and I made it not there anymore.

07:02.080 --> 07:03.360
It was pretty badass.

07:03.360 --> 07:04.560
What did Edward Norton think?

07:04.560 --> 07:07.280
And then I threw up a frog, but that was unrelated.

07:07.840 --> 07:10.640
Tell me about the time you set Edward Norton's shoes on fire

07:10.640 --> 07:13.920
and then spit water on them so hard that they went out.

07:13.920 --> 07:14.880
Yes, please.

07:14.880 --> 07:17.760
Well, it was his fucking birthday.

07:21.520 --> 07:24.000
I took him out to dinner at a Ruth's Chris

07:24.560 --> 07:27.120
and they were doing it hibachi style.

07:27.920 --> 07:28.720
Okay.

07:28.720 --> 07:29.760
Yeah, go on.

07:29.760 --> 07:31.440
This is a more thorough recount.

07:33.760 --> 07:37.120
I'm not gonna say, I'm not gonna try to jump to conclusions here,

07:37.120 --> 07:39.600
but Chekhov's gun, you've introduced the hibachi

07:39.600 --> 07:40.800
and his shoes were on fire.

07:40.800 --> 07:42.640
I'm having a hard time not connecting the two.

07:42.640 --> 07:45.840
Yeah, that may be a fake though, it may be a red herring.

07:45.840 --> 07:46.480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:46.480 --> 07:49.360
I get you looking over there at the hibachi table

07:49.360 --> 07:52.960
and then when it happens, your watch is not fucking there anymore.

07:52.960 --> 07:54.560
Whoa, you stole my watch.

07:54.560 --> 07:55.280
Yeah, and then-

07:55.280 --> 07:57.680
And you replaced it with Edward Norton's shoes?

07:57.680 --> 07:59.520
Yeah, and then what's that in my mouth?

07:59.520 --> 08:01.920
It's another frog, damn it, damn it.

08:02.480 --> 08:05.680
Now, so how did the shoes come to ignite?

08:05.680 --> 08:07.920
I'm not gonna give you all my secrets, but I-

08:07.920 --> 08:10.000
Was that the trick that you made his shoes flammable?

08:10.000 --> 08:14.320
Yeah, I took, I changed the stuff that it's made out of

08:14.960 --> 08:18.080
into a sort of polyester of my own design.

08:18.080 --> 08:20.720
I have my own shoe line of extremely burnable shoes

08:21.360 --> 08:22.960
dropping this summer.

08:22.960 --> 08:26.080
Oh wait, summer's over, I forgot, man.

08:26.080 --> 08:27.600
I guess I just thought that the trick was

08:27.600 --> 08:30.240
how much water you regurgitated upon his shoes.

08:30.880 --> 08:32.320
No, hey, you wanna see me float?

08:32.320 --> 08:32.720
Woo!

08:32.720 --> 08:33.360
Yep.

08:33.360 --> 08:33.860
Whoa!

08:34.800 --> 08:36.640
Okay, I'm gonna float off, but anyway, yeah,

08:36.640 --> 08:41.360
I got lunch plans with fucking Balloon Boy.

08:41.360 --> 08:43.600
Me and Balloon Boy are gonna hit up Bruce Criss,

08:43.600 --> 08:44.880
and you know what he's in for.

08:46.080 --> 08:48.240
Say goodbye to your kids, Balloon Boy.

08:48.240 --> 08:50.320
Cooking them up hibachi style.

08:54.240 --> 08:55.840
Oh man, what a big get.

08:56.720 --> 08:59.520
I mean, I had so many questions to ask him, I forgot.

08:59.520 --> 09:01.120
Yeah, there's a lot.

09:01.120 --> 09:01.760
What did you mean?

09:02.960 --> 09:04.160
Hey, sorry, David, just real quick-

09:04.160 --> 09:05.280
Attention!

09:05.280 --> 09:07.920
How did you put my playing card inside the bottle?

09:08.560 --> 09:11.520
Oh, the bottle isn't real.

09:12.240 --> 09:13.920
Oh, fuck, yeah, okay.

09:15.200 --> 09:15.760
I see that now.

09:15.760 --> 09:17.760
Hey guys, David just floated out the window

09:17.760 --> 09:18.640
in his big balloons.

09:19.760 --> 09:21.920
Griffin, are you ready to start My Brother, My Brother and Me?

09:21.920 --> 09:22.800
Yeah, let's do it.

09:22.800 --> 09:24.320
All right, just press record, everybody.

09:24.320 --> 09:24.820
Okay.

09:25.600 --> 09:27.120
So this is a advice show.

09:28.160 --> 09:29.200
Obviously.

09:29.200 --> 09:31.040
Obviously, let's help people.

09:31.040 --> 09:32.160
I live in an apartment building,

09:32.160 --> 09:34.160
and today the windows are being washed.

09:34.160 --> 09:36.400
Since I'm working from home in a tiny apartment,

09:36.400 --> 09:38.800
my desk is six inches away from the window,

09:38.800 --> 09:42.640
and a window washing guy just dropped into view.

09:42.640 --> 09:44.240
We acknowledge each other and I thanked him,

09:44.240 --> 09:45.600
and now I'm sitting here pretending to work

09:45.600 --> 09:47.040
staring at my computer screen while this,

09:47.600 --> 09:50.080
while this gentleman is literally six inches from me

09:50.080 --> 09:52.480
staring back at me while doing his job.

09:52.480 --> 09:55.040
I have a full cup of coffee and toast already on my desk,

09:55.040 --> 09:57.440
so there's no excuse to get up and put it around the kitchen.

09:57.440 --> 10:00.160
The anxiety currently feels unlike anything I've ever felt.

10:00.160 --> 10:02.480
How do I most effectively cover the fact

10:02.480 --> 10:05.120
or convey the fact that I'm definitely working

10:05.120 --> 10:07.360
and not just trying to avoid eye contact with him?

10:07.360 --> 10:09.200
That's from working in Washington.

10:10.320 --> 10:12.240
I think my favorite part of this question

10:12.240 --> 10:16.080
is the conceit, the belief that if you got up

10:16.080 --> 10:18.080
to go to the kitchen, the window washer would be like,

10:18.080 --> 10:18.720
where are you going?

10:18.720 --> 10:20.960
You got a full cup of coffee.

10:20.960 --> 10:21.920
Where are you going?

10:21.920 --> 10:22.720
Is this about me?

10:23.520 --> 10:25.040
This is one of many questions,

10:25.040 --> 10:27.360
and it's a sort of, it's a genre of question

10:27.360 --> 10:30.480
that we get from our listeners who I adore

10:30.480 --> 10:33.440
because we are so very alike, us and our listeners,

10:33.440 --> 10:38.160
where you are assuming that this person's

10:38.800 --> 10:42.160
sort of whole mindset is about you in this moment

10:42.160 --> 10:43.840
because that's what anxiety does to you,

10:44.400 --> 10:47.840
when really you can get up and they're not gonna,

10:47.840 --> 10:49.040
they're not gonna pay you,

10:49.040 --> 10:50.400
they're not gonna pay you any mind.

10:50.400 --> 10:51.760
They're listening to the radio.

10:52.800 --> 10:54.960
Or focusing on not falling to their death,

10:54.960 --> 10:57.520
which is what I would be doing in their position.

10:57.520 --> 11:00.240
Yeah, they're on the clock and they're dialed in.

11:00.240 --> 11:02.320
They're probably not concerned with you

11:02.320 --> 11:03.920
or what you're doing or anything about you

11:03.920 --> 11:04.640
because guess what?

11:04.640 --> 11:05.840
They're gonna go by a bunch of windows

11:05.840 --> 11:07.040
with a bunch of people working in them.

11:07.040 --> 11:09.120
If they gave a shit about every single person

11:09.120 --> 11:10.160
in every single window,

11:10.160 --> 11:14.080
it would take up a lot of sort of emotional lift.

11:14.080 --> 11:17.040
Now, okay, here's what I will say though, Griffin.

11:17.040 --> 11:17.540
Yeah.

11:18.240 --> 11:21.200
Speaking of putting ourselves in place of our listeners,

11:21.200 --> 11:23.040
if I was the window washer,

11:23.040 --> 11:25.200
I would, upon looking at every window,

11:25.200 --> 11:26.400
think, what are they doing?

11:26.960 --> 11:27.920
I think that like that-

11:27.920 --> 11:28.960
Of course you would.

11:28.960 --> 11:32.720
No, like, obviously you would because-

11:32.720 --> 11:33.680
Every time?

11:33.680 --> 11:34.960
This is what I wanted to say.

11:34.960 --> 11:35.840
This is what I wanted to say.

11:36.800 --> 11:39.280
These people are doing an incredibly dangerous job,

11:40.240 --> 11:42.720
the fine people of the window washing industry.

11:42.720 --> 11:44.480
That's a dangerous gig, I'm thinking.

11:44.480 --> 11:46.080
They probably have some safety protocols in place,

11:46.080 --> 11:48.880
but by and large, it's more dangerous than a lot of gigs.

11:48.880 --> 11:49.680
It's just a bunch of balloons.

11:50.240 --> 11:51.520
Letting them, and it's boring.

11:52.480 --> 11:53.920
You know, it's probably a lot of times,

11:53.920 --> 11:55.600
once you get into the rhythm, it's probably boring.

11:55.600 --> 12:00.400
You owe them, they have the right.

12:01.040 --> 12:04.000
What I'm saying is we owe them a little bit of entertainment,

12:04.000 --> 12:08.640
a little show, I think, just to help them pass the time

12:08.640 --> 12:11.200
on the boring, dangerous thing that they are doing

12:11.200 --> 12:12.960
for our edification.

12:12.960 --> 12:14.480
Is that thing-

12:14.480 --> 12:17.600
This futile act that will be undone by entropy

12:17.600 --> 12:19.600
and the ravages of time in-

12:19.600 --> 12:20.080
And birds.

12:20.080 --> 12:24.080
A matter of days, and birds, thank you, Travis, and bugs.

12:24.080 --> 12:28.640
Not bugs, just let them have a look-see at what you're doing.

12:28.640 --> 12:29.760
Give them a show.

12:29.760 --> 12:30.880
Just give them a show.

12:30.880 --> 12:32.320
Don't let them know you're there though,

12:32.320 --> 12:33.440
because that's not their thing.

12:33.440 --> 12:35.680
No, but I do, it has just now occurred to me,

12:35.680 --> 12:38.960
this is probably why Hitchcock called his movie Rear Window

12:38.960 --> 12:40.240
instead of just Window,

12:40.240 --> 12:42.240
because it would be a way different experience

12:42.240 --> 12:45.360
in Rear Window if it was a cleaner six inches away.

12:45.360 --> 12:47.360
Just like, hey, did you kill somebody?

12:47.360 --> 12:49.520
Hey, I saw that, mister.

12:49.520 --> 12:52.320
I'm right here.

12:52.320 --> 12:55.280
You can pretend I don't exist like that guy in Washington

12:55.280 --> 12:56.560
that one time.

12:56.560 --> 13:00.160
But I'm right here, and I'm pretty sure you killed your wife

13:00.160 --> 13:01.840
and maybe a dog in a bucket.

13:01.840 --> 13:04.640
It's been a while since Travis has seen Rear Window.

13:04.640 --> 13:08.000
Why are you telling me about when Travis saw Rear Window?

13:08.000 --> 13:11.040
Well, I'm just trying to share a brief moment of humanity

13:11.040 --> 13:13.200
with you to bring us closer together.

13:13.200 --> 13:15.120
Oh, you went in the kitchen, okay?

13:15.920 --> 13:18.480
What do you do with all those creepy sneak-rits

13:18.480 --> 13:21.920
that you find when you're going down the windows?

13:21.920 --> 13:23.200
This is like code.

13:23.200 --> 13:24.560
This is the sacred code.

13:24.560 --> 13:25.520
Oh.

13:25.520 --> 13:28.160
Yeah, the sacred code of the window washer

13:28.720 --> 13:31.760
is that you may watch all the secrets,

13:31.760 --> 13:34.320
but you must lock them in an amulet

13:34.320 --> 13:37.520
that you keep around your neck.

13:37.520 --> 13:38.720
That powers you.

13:38.720 --> 13:40.800
Yeah, you whisper the secrets into the amulet,

13:40.800 --> 13:44.000
and that's what keeps your floating hover platform aloft.

13:44.000 --> 13:44.640
Correct.

13:44.640 --> 13:45.440
The power of secrets.

13:45.440 --> 13:46.960
Oh, it's not cables like in movies.

13:46.960 --> 13:47.760
No.

13:47.760 --> 13:49.200
No, no, no, no.

13:49.200 --> 13:50.960
Those are just there to keep up appearances,

13:50.960 --> 13:51.920
but they do nothing.

13:51.920 --> 13:53.520
That's an illusion created by the amulet.

13:53.520 --> 13:56.560
How come every time someone gets on one of those

13:56.560 --> 14:00.160
in movies and TVs, it always falls?

14:00.160 --> 14:00.880
Always falls.

14:00.880 --> 14:02.400
Wouldn't get on one in a movie.

14:02.400 --> 14:08.160
Like, I think the rate of incident

14:08.160 --> 14:10.800
in which the window washer platform does fall

14:10.800 --> 14:12.320
would have to be exceptionally low,

14:12.320 --> 14:15.680
or else I would assume we'd just leave these bad boys dirty.

14:15.680 --> 14:17.520
Do you think when window washers see that move,

14:17.520 --> 14:19.680
they're like, no, no, come on, that's not-

14:19.680 --> 14:20.320
Come on.

14:20.320 --> 14:21.840
Get its restraints on.

14:21.840 --> 14:22.480
Come on.

14:22.480 --> 14:23.440
That's not how it works.

14:24.080 --> 14:25.280
It's got redundancies.

14:25.280 --> 14:26.080
Are you kidding me?

14:26.080 --> 14:26.400
What is this?

14:26.400 --> 14:28.320
I have to assume it has redundancies.

14:28.320 --> 14:29.200
Can I do a Yahoo?

14:30.720 --> 14:32.480
I would like to see a scene in a movie

14:32.480 --> 14:35.120
where somebody gets onto the platform and everything,

14:35.120 --> 14:36.080
it's like tense music,

14:36.080 --> 14:38.080
but then it's just like a half hour scene of them

14:38.080 --> 14:39.760
figuring out how the controls work,

14:39.760 --> 14:40.720
and then turning it on,

14:40.720 --> 14:43.120
and then lowering themselves like a hundred floors,

14:43.120 --> 14:44.640
and then getting off at the bottom,

14:44.640 --> 14:47.440
and then like, I don't know, getting in a cab, you know?

14:47.440 --> 14:49.520
I'd like to see a scene where the green goblin

14:49.520 --> 14:51.440
knocks a window washer's platform down,

14:51.440 --> 14:52.320
and Spider-Man's like,

14:52.320 --> 14:53.440
oh fuck, I gotta get over there,

14:53.440 --> 14:54.240
and he swings over there,

14:54.240 --> 14:55.360
and the window watcher's like,

14:55.360 --> 14:57.040
I had proper safety protocols in place.

14:57.040 --> 14:59.200
Yes, I mean, there's redundancies.

14:59.200 --> 14:59.520
I'm fine.

14:59.520 --> 15:00.720
There's redundancies, of course.

15:01.520 --> 15:04.160
If you're a window washer listening to podcasts,

15:04.160 --> 15:06.080
please get at us and let us know,

15:06.640 --> 15:08.720
I guess, everything that's going on over there.

15:08.720 --> 15:10.800
Yeah, give us a play-by-play of what you see.

15:10.800 --> 15:12.960
Yeah, and describe your amulet in detail.

15:12.960 --> 15:14.080
Yeah, be honest.

15:14.080 --> 15:14.880
We'll know.

15:14.880 --> 15:15.380
We'll know.

15:15.380 --> 15:18.580
Uh, here's a Yahoo that was sent in by Sean.

15:18.580 --> 15:19.460
Thanks, Sean.

15:19.460 --> 15:21.380
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Nope,

15:21.380 --> 15:23.700
who has a, he's got a question here

15:24.740 --> 15:26.900
that has been on the tip of my tongue,

15:26.900 --> 15:28.900
and Sean, Nope, has managed to put it into words

15:28.900 --> 15:30.020
in a way I never have.

15:30.020 --> 15:32.020
Thank you, Nope, for your bravery.

15:32.020 --> 15:37.620
Nope asks, why hasn't there ever been a wizard wrestler?

15:38.420 --> 15:39.380
Huh, huh.

15:39.380 --> 15:43.380
Like in WWE, the wizard wrestler would have special powers

15:43.380 --> 15:46.180
like controlling other wrestlers via telekinesis.

15:46.180 --> 15:48.580
He'd definitely be jacked and wear a speedo,

15:48.580 --> 15:51.060
but he'd also have a big white beard and a wizard hat.

15:51.060 --> 15:52.980
I did not read that part before.

15:52.980 --> 15:56.660
I mean, I did not vet that part correctly.

15:56.660 --> 16:01.140
I imagined more of a sort of Gandalfian vibe.

16:01.140 --> 16:02.180
Yeah, that's true.

16:02.180 --> 16:04.500
You were thinking more of a svelte,

16:04.500 --> 16:06.820
not so much a beefcake, but perhaps,

16:06.820 --> 16:15.140
you know, like a svelte, jaguar-esque, you know.

16:15.140 --> 16:18.180
I was more thinking about the the the hemp and garments

16:18.180 --> 16:19.620
of a Christopher Lee,

16:19.620 --> 16:23.940
but not necessarily a speedo with rippling muscles,

16:23.940 --> 16:26.500
but I guess wizards come in all shapes and sizes.

16:26.500 --> 16:28.020
Yeah, it is interesting to me, Griffin,

16:28.020 --> 16:30.180
that you assume that Gandalf underneath that robe

16:30.180 --> 16:31.620
isn't rippling with muscles.

16:31.620 --> 16:33.140
Isn't like huge.

16:33.140 --> 16:33.380
Yeah, maybe.

16:33.380 --> 16:34.020
You don't know that.

16:34.820 --> 16:35.860
Gandalf the Shredded.

16:35.860 --> 16:40.980
Wrestling has some, it requires remarkable athleticism,

16:40.980 --> 16:44.420
and there is obviously an inherent risk

16:44.420 --> 16:48.260
to every bout that happens in that beautiful cage,

16:49.620 --> 16:51.860
but also sometimes they do a make-believe.

16:51.860 --> 16:54.260
Yeah, that's interesting.

16:54.900 --> 16:56.980
I know that there's been a wrestler

16:56.980 --> 17:00.180
who would take off a sock and make you smell it

17:00.180 --> 17:01.940
so bad that you fall asleep,

17:02.580 --> 17:04.740
so I don't see why there can't be a wrestler

17:04.740 --> 17:09.460
who takes you over with his psychic powers.

17:09.460 --> 17:10.660
Would that be the problem, though,

17:10.660 --> 17:13.940
is that wrestling already has a sort of,

17:13.940 --> 17:15.220
we know this, this is not,

17:16.260 --> 17:19.380
there's a tenuous relationship to reality in wrestling,

17:19.380 --> 17:21.940
and they're constantly playing with that

17:21.940 --> 17:24.820
in a word that I will not attempt to pronounce

17:24.820 --> 17:26.260
because I've been saying it for 10 years

17:26.260 --> 17:28.260
and I've never managed to get it right, but it's-

17:28.260 --> 17:29.220
Kayfabe?

17:29.220 --> 17:29.780
Thank you.

17:29.780 --> 17:31.460
Sure, Travis had it this time, tweeted him.

17:31.460 --> 17:34.900
But I feel like introducing,

17:35.780 --> 17:38.340
it would be straining the bounds of believability

17:38.340 --> 17:40.420
if you did just have one wrestler show up

17:40.420 --> 17:43.940
and this one does have magical powers.

17:43.940 --> 17:47.460
It seems to me like people are okay with someone

17:48.020 --> 17:52.820
maybe being an undertaker and maybe being dead in some way

17:52.820 --> 17:55.700
and having a manager who may or may not be dead.

17:55.700 --> 17:56.420
That was an act.

17:57.140 --> 17:59.380
I think that if you're gonna have a magician character,

17:59.380 --> 18:03.620
the premise can't be I always loved wizards growing up

18:03.620 --> 18:05.780
and so I've styled myself as a wizard.

18:05.780 --> 18:10.260
It must be I'm a wizard who will win the fight with magic.

18:10.260 --> 18:13.540
I find it hard to believe that there has not been a wrestler

18:13.540 --> 18:16.260
who could perhaps mesmerize or hypnotize.

18:17.780 --> 18:20.820
I mean, we do have something like that now.

18:20.820 --> 18:25.140
There is someone who uses what I will refer to

18:25.140 --> 18:30.980
as just sort of swamp magic to cast people

18:30.980 --> 18:34.100
into sort of illusory hellscapes.

18:34.100 --> 18:35.220
That feels real.

18:35.220 --> 18:36.980
Yeah, that doesn't bother me.

18:36.980 --> 18:38.420
So we got that, right?

18:38.420 --> 18:39.460
Why not wizard?

18:39.460 --> 18:41.220
In the last Wrestlemania,

18:42.020 --> 18:46.020
the fucking Undertaker killed AJ Styles.

18:48.260 --> 18:49.940
Guys, he's a performer.

18:49.940 --> 18:51.300
He's an entertainer.

18:51.300 --> 18:55.460
Alan Jones fucking killed him

18:55.460 --> 19:00.020
and buried his dead ass six feet under the loam.

19:00.020 --> 19:01.220
Dust to dust, baby.

19:01.220 --> 19:03.140
This dude's dead as disco

19:03.140 --> 19:04.500
and then he's back the next week.

19:04.500 --> 19:06.020
So why not wizards, I guess?

19:06.020 --> 19:07.220
What happened when he came back?

19:07.220 --> 19:08.340
Hold on, I am curious, Griffin.

19:08.340 --> 19:12.340
When he came back, was there any zombie theme?

19:12.340 --> 19:15.540
No, he was just kind of back

19:15.540 --> 19:17.860
and he was pretty peeved at the Undertaker,

19:17.860 --> 19:20.100
but they only do the Undertaker at Wrestlemania.

19:20.100 --> 19:22.180
So he kind of let bygones be bygones

19:22.180 --> 19:23.060
for another year at least.

19:23.060 --> 19:24.260
He got over it.

19:24.260 --> 19:26.020
He got over it.

19:26.020 --> 19:27.220
Maybe next Wrestlemania,

19:27.220 --> 19:28.740
he'll show up at the Undertaker fight

19:28.740 --> 19:32.820
and be like, I did not appreciate you killing my ass dead

19:33.460 --> 19:36.500
and putting me in the ground like a dead body does.

19:36.500 --> 19:38.660
I think if you were going to have a wizard character,

19:39.380 --> 19:42.500
they would have to only be able to access their powers

19:42.500 --> 19:44.900
once X had been accomplished.

19:44.900 --> 19:47.380
They could not walk right out the gate

19:47.380 --> 19:50.580
and blast you with a fireball or lightning or whatever.

19:50.580 --> 19:53.300
It would have to be like they got to power up

19:53.300 --> 19:55.380
via getting punched enough, right?

19:55.380 --> 19:57.780
Or maybe it's rage fueled magic

19:59.220 --> 20:01.700
or it's the cheers of the crowd, perhaps.

20:01.700 --> 20:05.220
Yeah, I mean, we got Finn Balor who turns into the beast

20:05.220 --> 20:06.420
when he gets psyched up.

20:06.420 --> 20:08.420
There's a lot of people who transform

20:09.060 --> 20:10.340
into bestial characters.

20:10.340 --> 20:12.820
So why not a fucking wizard, please?

20:12.820 --> 20:16.740
It's such a shame that live audiences

20:16.740 --> 20:18.660
aren't permitted at wrestling events now

20:18.660 --> 20:20.820
because I would love to start seeing the crowd

20:20.820 --> 20:22.660
filled with why not a wizard signs.

20:22.660 --> 20:23.300
Yeah.

20:23.300 --> 20:24.660
Maybe once things,

20:24.660 --> 20:26.500
but I feel like the heat of this is going to be gone

20:26.500 --> 20:28.580
by the time we wrap up the COVID stuff.

20:28.580 --> 20:30.180
Could it be a social campaign?

20:31.140 --> 20:32.820
Hashtag why not a wizard.

20:32.820 --> 20:34.980
Tweet events, right?

20:34.980 --> 20:37.220
Well, you don't have to tweet at anybody.

20:37.220 --> 20:40.900
You can just tweet simply hashtag why not a wizard.

20:40.900 --> 20:45.060
How that's so that there is no wrestling connection to that.

20:45.060 --> 20:46.580
Oh, you don't think that's obvious?

20:47.140 --> 20:48.660
I didn't think it needed to be stated.

20:48.660 --> 20:50.820
I think that when someone sees that

20:50.820 --> 20:53.940
they will immediately think of the void in wrestling

20:53.940 --> 20:55.300
of being like, yeah, you're right.

20:55.300 --> 20:56.260
Why not a wizard?

20:57.300 --> 20:59.380
Bray Wyatt has swamp magic

20:59.380 --> 21:02.020
and he transforms into a beast.

21:02.020 --> 21:03.060
Well, he took both.

21:03.060 --> 21:03.940
He can't do that.

21:03.940 --> 21:04.660
That's what I'm saying.

21:05.540 --> 21:08.500
There should be, even if somebody's already got a thing.

21:08.500 --> 21:09.540
Why not a wizard?

21:09.540 --> 21:11.620
Why not Roman Reigns?

21:11.620 --> 21:13.220
Some people are still not over.

21:13.220 --> 21:16.820
Just fucking give him telekinesis.

21:16.820 --> 21:19.060
It's so easy.

21:19.060 --> 21:22.500
Some sort of baby face person,

21:22.500 --> 21:25.700
like one of the wrestlers that doesn't have a cool name.

21:25.700 --> 21:27.140
They just are their regular name.

21:28.260 --> 21:29.940
And like John Cena.

21:29.940 --> 21:33.780
Like John Cena who could come back as the wizard.

21:33.780 --> 21:36.580
Maybe a character, oh, oh, maybe that's the thing

21:36.580 --> 21:38.500
is Roman Reigns, Griffin.

21:38.500 --> 21:40.740
You mentioned people, he was supposed to be a hero

21:40.740 --> 21:41.700
and then people didn't like him.

21:41.700 --> 21:42.260
Is that correct?

21:42.900 --> 21:45.300
Yeah, I mean, that was ancient history,

21:45.300 --> 21:47.780
but still, yes, he's not over in some people's hearts.

21:47.780 --> 21:50.900
Perhaps he discovers his powers.

21:50.900 --> 21:53.460
They manifest one day while saving someone.

21:54.420 --> 21:57.300
And this is, it's not like, it's not retcon.

21:57.300 --> 21:59.700
This is a new development of like, yes.

21:59.700 --> 22:03.460
And also I saw a child about to be hit by a car

22:03.460 --> 22:05.860
and I magic that car away.

22:05.860 --> 22:07.940
Okay, so that's how I found my powers.

22:07.940 --> 22:10.660
He has this fantastical move where he cocks his arm

22:10.660 --> 22:14.340
like it's a shotgun and he does jump in the air

22:14.340 --> 22:16.020
and he punches somebody with this arm

22:16.020 --> 22:19.300
that I guess he has prepared in some way.

22:19.300 --> 22:20.900
He has loaded it in some way.

22:20.900 --> 22:22.420
So what if the next time he does it,

22:22.420 --> 22:25.380
he just cocks it and like a fucking lightning bolt comes out

22:25.380 --> 22:27.780
and he's like, whoa, what the fuck?

22:27.780 --> 22:28.740
Did you guys see that?

22:28.740 --> 22:32.500
And then we would do cussing in the WWE again.

22:34.340 --> 22:36.340
One of the cool things about having a wizard

22:36.340 --> 22:39.140
is that you could, he's unbeatable, right?

22:39.140 --> 22:41.220
Because of magic, but you could,

22:42.420 --> 22:46.260
like there's an object outside of the ring in our world

22:47.140 --> 22:48.820
where his power is contained.

22:49.460 --> 22:52.580
Because I think one of the things about wrestling that sucks

22:52.580 --> 22:59.300
is that it's always in that, the square.

22:59.300 --> 23:01.620
And I feel like if they had an opportunity

23:01.620 --> 23:03.620
to do some storylines that was just

23:03.620 --> 23:07.300
just the Undertaker rampaging through Detroit

23:07.300 --> 23:12.980
looking for the secret dagger of, we'll get it in post.

23:12.980 --> 23:14.260
Yeah, we'll figure it out.

23:16.020 --> 23:18.340
Yeah, oh man, that would be so good

23:18.340 --> 23:21.540
because I would love to see Vince taking part in it.

23:21.540 --> 23:23.060
Like, did you find the dagger?

23:23.060 --> 23:26.260
Like doing his very best acting.

23:26.260 --> 23:27.460
We have to stab the heart.

23:28.020 --> 23:31.140
You need to go into the ancient vault of Rylech.

23:31.140 --> 23:35.380
I think at some point I stopped describing wrestling

23:35.380 --> 23:37.460
and started describing shows.

23:37.460 --> 23:37.860
Yeah.

23:37.860 --> 23:40.100
But it would be cool if it was like shows.

23:40.100 --> 23:44.180
What if there was a companion television show to wrestling

23:44.180 --> 23:46.180
where they were going on adventures

23:46.180 --> 23:46.900
and maybe there were teams.

23:46.900 --> 23:48.820
You're gonna say if there was a companion character

23:48.820 --> 23:50.500
to the Undertaker, like,

23:50.500 --> 23:52.340
I know I don't have wrestling powers,

23:52.340 --> 23:54.180
but I'm here to provide celebrity.

23:54.180 --> 23:56.580
My name is Dirk Taker.

23:56.580 --> 23:57.780
I'm your son.

23:57.780 --> 24:00.100
I'm your son and I will find the dagger

24:00.100 --> 24:02.020
and I will stop the magic man.

24:02.020 --> 24:03.620
Griffin, are there any wrestlers?

24:03.620 --> 24:04.900
I turned 17, dad.

24:04.900 --> 24:06.580
I got my wrestling powers.

24:06.580 --> 24:07.620
I'm proud of you, Dirk.

24:07.620 --> 24:09.460
I'm proud of you, Dirk.

24:09.460 --> 24:11.940
Dad, I'm gonna be a nice guy who brings life.

24:11.940 --> 24:12.260
What?

24:12.820 --> 24:14.420
You've disappointed me again, Dirk.

24:14.980 --> 24:16.740
He's making a smack down to APU.

24:16.740 --> 24:17.460
Son of the Undertaker.

24:17.460 --> 24:19.220
Everybody, here comes Dirk Taker.

24:19.220 --> 24:20.420
Oh, he's got a dagger.

24:21.140 --> 24:21.620
You can't.

24:22.180 --> 24:23.620
He took that, Dirk.

24:23.620 --> 24:23.860
Hey, bud.

24:23.860 --> 24:26.100
No, he's got my dagger.

24:26.100 --> 24:28.420
Oh, the wizard seems pretty worried about this.

24:28.420 --> 24:31.220
For the first time, the wizard is worried.

24:31.220 --> 24:33.460
My power has been compromised.

24:34.340 --> 24:36.900
Oh, and it's the wizard's son, Tom.

24:37.620 --> 24:38.580
Hi, I'm Tom.

24:38.580 --> 24:40.660
I don't wrestle.

24:40.660 --> 24:43.060
Dirk Taker is swiping his knife at the...

24:43.060 --> 24:44.900
We gotta call this, guys.

24:44.900 --> 24:46.180
Oh no, the wizard.

24:46.180 --> 24:50.260
His skin is melting and the roaches that were ambulating his body

24:50.260 --> 24:52.260
have just started to disintegrate.

24:52.980 --> 24:53.460
That's right.

24:53.460 --> 25:00.180
He was just an ambulating skin shield for a bunch of living roaches.

25:00.180 --> 25:03.140
We'll have to see how this affects the rankings or whatever.

25:03.140 --> 25:06.420
I'm gonna run WWE to the ground just from like budgets

25:06.420 --> 25:09.380
on the effects we're gonna need for this show.

25:09.380 --> 25:13.700
I would want it to be some ratty ass Men in Black 1 era

25:14.500 --> 25:19.700
like PlayStation 1 low poly just sort of dissolving man effect.

25:19.700 --> 25:21.380
That would be so fucking good.

25:21.380 --> 25:23.060
God, we should write wrestling.

25:23.060 --> 25:24.260
God, they should let us do wrestling.

25:24.260 --> 25:27.700
Are there any wrestlers who their whole gimmick, their whole thing

25:27.700 --> 25:31.140
is that they always seem surprised to be in a wrestling match?

25:31.140 --> 25:34.100
Like maybe they were just like a fan who got up to go to the bathroom

25:34.100 --> 25:35.620
or like buy a program or whatever.

25:35.620 --> 25:37.940
And then it was like, wait, I'm a what?

25:37.940 --> 25:38.500
Huh?

25:38.500 --> 25:40.980
Oh, okay, Travis, this is perfect.

25:40.980 --> 25:44.420
The character's name is Phil Spigot and he doesn't want to wrestle.

25:44.420 --> 25:47.780
And what happens is the wrestlers have to go and find him

25:47.780 --> 25:50.180
and start the wrestling against his will.

25:50.180 --> 25:52.020
And he's just like in line for the men's room.

25:52.020 --> 25:52.820
You're right.

25:52.820 --> 25:55.140
He doesn't know the wrestling is about to.

25:55.140 --> 25:59.460
That's the problem is that all these wrestlers are waiting until the match starts.

25:59.460 --> 26:01.140
If you want to get serious about this,

26:01.140 --> 26:03.780
you need to start finding these people in their daily lives.

26:03.780 --> 26:04.820
Yeah, I'm pretty sure-

26:04.820 --> 26:05.780
Hey, where's Phil?

26:05.780 --> 26:08.500
I don't think he came to the wrestling match.

26:08.500 --> 26:09.860
I'm going to his house.

26:09.860 --> 26:10.980
I'm gonna find him.

26:10.980 --> 26:17.140
I think Braun Strowman was just like getting some pretzels at Smackdown

26:17.140 --> 26:18.260
and they're like, what do you do, man?

26:18.260 --> 26:18.820
Get up there.

26:18.820 --> 26:22.660
Dude, look at your fucking body.

26:22.660 --> 26:23.380
Get up there.

26:23.380 --> 26:26.820
Look at your incredible wrestler's body.

26:26.820 --> 26:27.620
Holy shit.

26:27.620 --> 26:28.580
I'm an accountant.

26:28.580 --> 26:30.980
Yeah, and no accounting for how big and beefy you are.

26:30.980 --> 26:31.620
Get up there.

26:34.100 --> 26:35.380
Actually, I'm an undertaker.

26:35.380 --> 26:36.340
Yeah, we get it.

26:36.340 --> 26:37.940
Yeah, right.

26:37.940 --> 26:39.860
I mean, I'm like a mortician.

26:40.820 --> 26:41.620
Well, that's taken.

26:41.620 --> 26:42.740
So you got to pick something else.

26:42.740 --> 26:44.980
You got to pick something else, but I am an undertaker.

26:44.980 --> 26:45.860
That's taken.

26:45.860 --> 26:46.500
It's taken.

26:46.500 --> 26:47.620
Can you be a wizard?

26:47.620 --> 26:48.580
I don't have powers.

26:48.580 --> 26:49.380
Damn it.

26:49.380 --> 26:55.540
Fuck, that would be great if like a big wrestler got to be the wizard.

26:55.540 --> 26:57.300
Yeah, just a big beefo.

26:57.300 --> 27:01.620
If Brock Lesnar shows up to the next wrestling match, I'm like, uh-oh, baby.

27:01.620 --> 27:02.740
Here we go.

27:02.740 --> 27:03.700
Suplex City.

27:03.700 --> 27:06.100
And he's like, no, I don't do that anymore.

27:08.740 --> 27:09.940
Check out my beard.

27:10.740 --> 27:13.940
My huge, mushy, vulnerable beard.

27:13.940 --> 27:18.260
He reaches into his fucking knife tattoo on his stomach and pulls out the actual

27:18.260 --> 27:18.760
dagger.

27:19.540 --> 27:21.620
He's opened a portal to hell.

27:22.260 --> 27:22.760
Whoa.

27:23.540 --> 27:24.100
Let me guess.

27:24.100 --> 27:26.020
You're going to suplex the other guy.

27:26.020 --> 27:27.300
I don't do that anymore.

27:27.300 --> 27:29.060
I don't suplex anymore.

27:29.060 --> 27:30.980
I use my mind now.

27:30.980 --> 27:36.900
I control time with the amulet around my neck, and I have a cape that moves on its own.

27:36.900 --> 27:38.740
Why would the wizard go into the ring?

27:38.740 --> 27:40.020
That's the question for me.

27:40.660 --> 27:47.060
If the wizard has these incredible powers, what storyline reason is there for-

27:47.060 --> 27:52.500
He could be just waiting for the wrestler to wrestle somebody else, eating some nachos

27:52.500 --> 27:56.020
in 37G, and then just blaze them, right?

27:56.020 --> 27:59.540
Well, the other wrestler said something mean about his girl.

28:00.340 --> 28:04.740
So he had to maybe smooch his mama or something.

28:04.740 --> 28:04.980
I don't know.

28:04.980 --> 28:06.580
I haven't watched wrestling since like 1998.

28:06.580 --> 28:07.220
That's bad.

28:07.220 --> 28:08.340
Let me give you this.

28:08.340 --> 28:11.140
His spells are powered by punches.

28:12.020 --> 28:13.460
That's what I said earlier.

28:13.460 --> 28:17.380
One spell, well, no, he's building spell energy, okay?

28:17.380 --> 28:19.220
So he has to slap the person.

28:19.220 --> 28:21.380
You know how sometimes they slap their belly?

28:21.380 --> 28:21.700
Yeah.

28:21.700 --> 28:22.660
Don't you love that?

28:22.660 --> 28:23.140
It's fun.

28:23.140 --> 28:24.660
That seems friendly.

28:24.660 --> 28:25.140
It's fun.

28:25.140 --> 28:27.860
Now, is it by punching others or getting punched, Justin?

28:28.660 --> 28:29.860
It's not even punching, Travis.

28:29.860 --> 28:31.620
It's an open hand belly slap.

28:31.620 --> 28:32.980
Yeah, it's an open hand belly slap.

28:32.980 --> 28:37.460
I'm just saying that maybe the wizard's powers are powered by being punched by someone else.

28:38.100 --> 28:38.500
Okay.

28:38.500 --> 28:41.700
So they have to get punched to power up their powers.

28:41.700 --> 28:42.260
That's huge.

28:42.260 --> 28:43.540
That's cool too.

28:43.540 --> 28:44.340
We should write wrestling.

28:44.340 --> 28:45.380
Get at us, whoever.

28:45.380 --> 28:48.980
I'm just saying wrestling, if you want us to write you, get at us.

28:48.980 --> 28:52.740
Maybe it has to happen in a geometric shape and they're too lazy to make their own.

28:53.620 --> 28:55.780
So they just use the ring to do it.

28:55.780 --> 29:03.220
What if the three of us filmed a sort of indie demo tape of us wrestling using this great fiction,

29:03.220 --> 29:08.260
but we did it in the front yard where everyone could see it.

29:08.260 --> 29:11.620
And then that way people wouldn't think that like something unsavory is happening.

29:11.620 --> 29:12.340
It's in the front.

29:12.340 --> 29:18.900
This is three boys front yard wrestling with supernatural elements.

29:18.900 --> 29:21.540
I was going to suggest that perhaps we were all three wizards.

29:21.540 --> 29:23.940
And then I thought, what if that became the thing?

29:23.940 --> 29:28.820
Every wrestler is still themselves, but also everyone has powers now.

29:28.820 --> 29:31.700
We are basically, this is Mortal Kombat level.

29:31.700 --> 29:39.540
Oh yeah, that guy, he studied karate until he became a master and also can turn into a dragon.

29:39.540 --> 29:43.380
They are separate, unrelated, but two things that he can do.

29:43.380 --> 29:48.340
He is a very good fighter and also can shoot ice out of his hands.

29:48.340 --> 29:50.900
I mean, again, you're just kind of making show now.

29:51.540 --> 29:55.220
You're just kind of making Mortal Kombat, the TV show.

29:55.220 --> 29:58.740
But also there's a real human element to it.

29:58.740 --> 30:00.100
Okay, it's too late.

30:00.100 --> 30:01.380
You fucked up the pitch.

30:01.380 --> 30:02.260
No one's going to buy this.

30:02.260 --> 30:09.620
It's, you know, we're going to have to fall back on our old funding model, advertising.

30:09.620 --> 30:10.260
Oh, okay.

30:10.260 --> 30:12.180
I thought you were going to say selling plasma.

30:12.180 --> 30:14.420
No, I thought we were going to do the max fun drive again,

30:14.420 --> 30:16.980
but I don't think we're allowed to do that.

30:16.980 --> 30:18.820
No, Jesse said no.

30:18.820 --> 30:19.540
Okay, let's go.

30:19.540 --> 30:31.540
You know what I love?

30:31.540 --> 30:32.820
What do you what?

30:32.820 --> 30:34.420
Listening to things.

30:34.420 --> 30:37.140
And so that is why I enjoy Audible.

30:37.140 --> 30:39.060
They got audio books and so much more.

30:39.060 --> 30:40.500
They got original podcasts.

30:40.500 --> 30:42.980
They have like interviews with people.

30:42.980 --> 30:44.900
They got all kinds of cool stuff on there.

30:44.900 --> 30:51.860
I recommended this to, I think I recommended it to Justin and then we passed that on to dad.

30:51.860 --> 30:55.700
And I've passed it on my friend's audio book that I thoroughly enjoyed,

30:55.700 --> 30:58.660
The Seven and a Half Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle.

30:58.660 --> 31:00.500
Oh my God, it's the best.

31:00.500 --> 31:07.300
If you love like mystery novels and you want to hear one like you've never heard before,

31:07.300 --> 31:13.060
The Seven and a Half Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle is absolutely incredible and will blow you away.

31:13.060 --> 31:15.700
Okay, you haven't recommended this to me.

31:15.700 --> 31:16.900
Though I don't know why you guys are having a secret.

31:16.900 --> 31:20.340
Stuart Turton, the author of that actually has another audio book.

31:20.340 --> 31:20.820
What?

31:21.380 --> 31:27.540
Yes, it's called The Devil and the Dark Water that is coming out in October.

31:27.540 --> 31:30.740
So there's another Audible one for you to look forward to.

31:30.740 --> 31:35.620
Also, let's see Maureen Johnson's Truly Devious series is incredible.

31:35.620 --> 31:36.580
Can't recommend enough.

31:37.620 --> 31:40.420
I just listened to James Acaster's classic Scrapes,

31:40.420 --> 31:43.620
which is so funny.

31:43.620 --> 31:44.420
It's so good.

31:45.540 --> 31:49.300
And listen, let's all be honest, you got some free time, right?

31:49.300 --> 31:52.580
We all have a little bit more free time this year than we were expecting.

31:53.380 --> 31:55.780

Whoa.

32:25.060 --> 32:25.380
Yeah.

32:25.380 --> 32:26.100
Okay.

32:26.100 --> 32:26.420
Yeah.

32:26.420 --> 32:27.940
Oh, that's a weird energy.

32:27.940 --> 32:28.260
Well.

32:28.260 --> 32:32.660
Guess we gotta say that after all our ads now or else people are gonna think we're assholes.

32:32.660 --> 32:36.980
Well, I mean, listen, I know it's the first time we've said it.

32:36.980 --> 32:41.300
We've said it out loud in each other's presence, let alone to each other.

32:42.100 --> 32:44.740
Well, I thought you were talking about to the audience too.

32:44.740 --> 32:45.860
Well, no, no, I am.

32:45.860 --> 32:46.660
Oh, let me be clear.

32:46.660 --> 32:47.620
That wasn't to you guys.

32:48.180 --> 32:48.660
Okay.

32:48.660 --> 32:50.340
Well, okay, let me just take this for a spin.

32:50.340 --> 32:58.580
Raycon makes very, very stylish premium earbuds that have great sound and they got this new

32:58.580 --> 33:02.340
model Raycon does called the Everyday E25 Earbuds.

33:02.340 --> 33:03.940
I love you guys so much.

33:03.940 --> 33:04.260
Whoa.

33:04.260 --> 33:06.020
But these are their best earbuds yet.

33:06.020 --> 33:10.900
They got six hours of play time, seamless Bluetooth pairing, more bass, a more compact

33:10.900 --> 33:15.060
design and a noise isolating fit.

33:15.060 --> 33:17.300
And you guys are so special to me.

33:19.140 --> 33:20.980

33:25.700 --> 33:27.140
Just pure machine.

33:27.140 --> 33:29.140
Just you and the machine, baby.

33:29.140 --> 33:29.940
I love you.

33:29.940 --> 33:30.900
Give them a try though.

33:30.900 --> 33:31.140
Wait.

33:31.140 --> 33:36.260

And together we host a podcast called Still Buffering, where we answer questions like,

34:16.500 --> 34:19.060
why should I not fall asleep first at a slumber party?

34:19.060 --> 34:20.260
How do I be fleek?

34:20.260 --> 34:23.380
Is it okay to break up with someone using emojis?

34:23.380 --> 34:25.140
And sometimes we talk about bugs.

34:25.140 --> 34:26.180
No, we don't.

34:26.180 --> 34:27.620
Nope.

34:27.620 --> 34:33.060
Find out the answers to these important questions and many more on Still Buffering,

34:33.060 --> 34:35.940
a sister's guide to teens through the ages.

34:35.940 --> 34:37.140
I am a teenager.

34:37.140 --> 34:40.420
And I was too.

34:40.420 --> 34:43.060
Butts, butts, butts, butts, butts.

34:43.060 --> 34:43.540
No.

34:53.540 --> 34:54.340
I have another question.

34:54.340 --> 34:56.260
Oh, sure.

34:56.260 --> 34:56.660
Sure.

34:56.660 --> 34:57.220
Yeah, yeah.

34:57.220 --> 35:01.540
Yesterday afternoon, my roommates and I had a tie dye party where I brought the dyes and

35:01.540 --> 35:02.900
we were going to do a bunch of shirts.

35:02.900 --> 35:03.780
Of course.

35:03.780 --> 35:04.740
At least I thought we were.

35:06.340 --> 35:09.300
My roommates both only brought one shirt each.

35:10.420 --> 35:13.140
And then had fun dying some of my old t-shirts as well.

35:14.020 --> 35:18.660
Looking at their shirts now before washing, I'm 100% certain that once I unwrap one,

35:18.660 --> 35:22.500
it's just going to be solid yellow because she used too much dye and I didn't notice.

35:22.500 --> 35:26.900
This is going to be so disappointing, especially since now I have five cool shirts to her.

35:26.900 --> 35:28.580
One solid yellow shirt.

35:29.300 --> 35:30.180
What should I do?

35:30.980 --> 35:32.900
Try to fix it before giving it to her?

35:32.900 --> 35:36.260
Tell her now, almost 24 hours later, that I didn't notice she messed up?

35:36.820 --> 35:38.260
Throw it away and start a whole new shirt?

35:39.060 --> 35:39.620
Please help.

35:39.620 --> 35:42.020
I don't have much time before I have to get the shirts back.

35:42.020 --> 35:43.060
Holy shit.

35:43.060 --> 35:45.540
This is actually a surprisingly challenging question.

35:45.540 --> 35:46.020
Yeah.

35:46.020 --> 35:46.980
This is a tough one.

35:46.980 --> 35:49.780
That's from tie dyeing for an answer in Chicago.

35:49.780 --> 35:51.700
There's a lot of hair on this.

35:51.700 --> 35:53.140
A lot of hair on this one.

35:53.140 --> 35:56.980
There's a lot of flies in the ointment.

35:57.780 --> 35:58.980
Because they only got the one shirt.

35:58.980 --> 36:00.180
They took one crack at it.

36:00.900 --> 36:02.020
This was a mistake.

36:02.020 --> 36:04.980
You don't show up to a tie-dye party with one shirt because that's saying like,

36:04.980 --> 36:07.460
hey everybody, it's me, the world's best tie-dyer.

36:08.260 --> 36:09.860
Sit back and watch me do my fucking thing.

36:09.860 --> 36:10.980
It is a cold shot.

36:11.620 --> 36:14.340
This one shirt is going to be better than your five.

36:15.700 --> 36:16.820
I wouldn't trust myself to do that.

36:16.820 --> 36:17.940
It is a competition.

36:17.940 --> 36:18.820
You are competing.

36:19.460 --> 36:20.020
Yeah.

36:20.020 --> 36:22.580
What, are you going to tie-dye for the fun of it?

36:22.580 --> 36:23.080
No.

36:23.780 --> 36:26.500
You tie-dye so that you have a good product at the end.

36:27.860 --> 36:29.140
Yeah, it's not that fun.

36:30.260 --> 36:32.340
It's like, it's maybe for a child.

36:32.340 --> 36:32.980
You know what I mean?

36:32.980 --> 36:36.260
For a child, it's fun, but you really want the finished product.

36:36.260 --> 36:41.140
I went, my girls tie-dyed a shirt somewhere.

36:41.140 --> 36:42.020
I can't even forget.

36:42.020 --> 36:43.060
It's been years.

36:43.060 --> 36:44.260
But they were so excited.

36:44.260 --> 36:46.100
They tie-dyed their shirts and then they said,

36:46.100 --> 36:48.660
now you just leave it in this bag for 24 hours.

36:48.660 --> 36:50.340
Are you fucking kidding me?

36:50.340 --> 36:52.900
You might as well have told my kids to throw this in an incinerator

36:52.900 --> 36:55.780
and forget it ever existed for as long as that sounded.

36:55.780 --> 36:57.380
Tie-dyeing isn't fun.

36:57.380 --> 36:58.740
Some people like it, Justin.

36:58.740 --> 36:59.380
A lot of it's a-

36:59.380 --> 37:04.580
I'm saying it can be pleasurable as a craft, but as a layman, it's not fun.

37:04.580 --> 37:05.140
Okay.

37:05.140 --> 37:09.060
Well, there are many things, Justin, I would argue that for some people are fun to do

37:09.060 --> 37:10.820
and for others are incredibly boring.

37:10.820 --> 37:11.220
Sure.

37:11.220 --> 37:15.140
This is obviously, do I have to codify everything I say on the show as,

37:15.140 --> 37:16.980
this is just my perspective, but-

37:16.980 --> 37:19.220
This is just my skewed view.

37:19.220 --> 37:19.460
Right.

37:21.940 --> 37:23.300
Let's start doing options, okay?

37:23.300 --> 37:26.660
Number one, you give her the yellow shirt and you say, congratulations,

37:27.700 --> 37:29.540
you made a shirt yellow.

37:29.540 --> 37:32.100
And you didn't do what you were trying to do,

37:32.100 --> 37:36.420
but this shirt wasn't yellow before and now it is and isn't that empowering.

37:36.420 --> 37:38.180
You have accomplished something.

37:38.180 --> 37:38.660
You have accomplished something.

37:38.660 --> 37:40.420
You have changed the nature of something.

37:40.420 --> 37:41.540
It's very nature.

37:41.540 --> 37:44.340
And if they're like a bright summer,

37:44.340 --> 37:47.460
then this is really going to compliment them.

37:47.460 --> 37:48.180
You know what I mean?

37:48.180 --> 37:48.980
I love a yellow.

37:48.980 --> 37:50.100
I look great in a yellow.

37:50.100 --> 37:51.060
It's my favorite color.

37:51.060 --> 37:52.420
If you told me, hey, Griffin,

37:54.900 --> 38:00.260
your attempt to iron on this picture of the cast of Night Court on this shirt

38:00.260 --> 38:02.980
didn't go so well, but you did dye it straight yellow.

38:02.980 --> 38:03.940
You smudged bull.

38:05.220 --> 38:07.220
You smudged bull and made the shirt straight.

38:07.220 --> 38:09.460
Just a big stretched out-

38:10.820 --> 38:13.380
He looks like a thumb because you smudged his face

38:13.380 --> 38:14.340
and now it's just a thumb.

38:15.540 --> 38:18.900
No, Richard Mould takes up the entirety of the shirt,

38:18.900 --> 38:22.180
just his bloated, stretched out, ruined face.

38:22.180 --> 38:24.820
But you nailed Laricat.

38:24.820 --> 38:25.540
Laricat's great.

38:25.540 --> 38:26.500
He's just on the back.

38:27.780 --> 38:30.020
But no, if it's just yellow, then I'd be fine

38:30.020 --> 38:31.140
because it's still a good shirt.

38:31.780 --> 38:32.260
It's still a fine shirt.

38:32.260 --> 38:33.940
But if that wasn't your goal, Griffin,

38:33.940 --> 38:36.340
it's like if I set out to make chicken soup

38:36.340 --> 38:38.340
and I ended up with a fine gazpacho,

38:39.220 --> 38:41.540
I think I'd be disappointed and confused,

38:41.540 --> 38:44.100
no matter how good this gazpacho was.

38:44.660 --> 38:47.700
You have to have, I think you can fix it

38:49.220 --> 38:51.460
because when they open it,

38:52.180 --> 38:55.780
one, they're gonna be so delighted by this amazing thing.

38:55.780 --> 38:58.740
These circles of color, come on.

38:58.740 --> 39:00.100
They're gonna be loving it.

39:00.100 --> 39:02.900
But even if that moment passes, and it will,

39:02.900 --> 39:06.340
like all pleasure, I don't think they're going to have

39:06.340 --> 39:08.660
a moment where they say, wait a minute,

39:08.660 --> 39:11.300
did they tie down my tie dye?

39:12.500 --> 39:13.700
Well, unless.

39:13.700 --> 39:15.460
It's so inconceivable.

39:15.460 --> 39:16.660
No, I will not.

39:16.660 --> 39:17.140
I shan't.

39:17.140 --> 39:17.540
You have to go.

39:17.540 --> 39:18.420
I can't grant you this.

39:18.420 --> 39:19.060
You have to go.

39:19.060 --> 39:20.020
It's in the contract.

39:20.020 --> 39:20.580
Unless.

39:21.700 --> 39:22.820
Unless.

39:22.820 --> 39:24.900
They didn't want a tie dyed shirt.

39:24.900 --> 39:26.900
They wanted a yellow shirt.

39:26.900 --> 39:27.140
Fuck.

39:27.860 --> 39:28.740
God damn it.

39:28.740 --> 39:33.220
I hate, just once, I'd like to find some fucking black

39:33.220 --> 39:36.180
and white in this world rather than living my existence

39:36.180 --> 39:37.380
in perpetual shades of gray.

39:37.380 --> 39:37.620
Yep.

39:37.620 --> 39:38.980
But Travis is right, of course.

39:39.540 --> 39:41.060
That's entirely possible.

39:41.060 --> 39:43.620
They just wanted, they had a shirt that was one color,

39:43.620 --> 39:44.980
they wanted it to be yellow instead.

39:44.980 --> 39:46.500
That's entirely possible.

39:46.500 --> 39:47.940
That you said, we're going to tie dye him.

39:47.940 --> 39:50.580
They thought, I'm never going to wear a tie dye shirt.

39:50.580 --> 39:50.820
But.

39:51.380 --> 39:52.340
But hey, free dye.

39:52.340 --> 39:53.220
But hey, free dye.

39:53.220 --> 39:55.780
I have been looking for an excuse to turn this shirt yellow.

39:57.460 --> 39:58.580
Hey, can I do a Yahoo?

39:59.140 --> 39:59.620
Yeah, I'd love that.

39:59.620 --> 40:01.220
We didn't help that person at all.

40:01.220 --> 40:01.940
Not a bit.

40:01.940 --> 40:02.100
No.

40:02.100 --> 40:02.740
Not a lick.

40:02.740 --> 40:03.620
It's too hard.

40:03.620 --> 40:04.260
Can't do it.

40:04.260 --> 40:04.980
Things are rough.

40:04.980 --> 40:07.700
You finally hit something we can't help with.

40:08.340 --> 40:10.660
I think it's because we don't know anything about tie dye.

40:10.660 --> 40:11.460
That's the problem.

40:11.460 --> 40:13.220
I don't know if you can tie dye on top of tie dye.

40:13.220 --> 40:15.220
Once the shirt is yellow, can you dye again?

40:16.660 --> 40:16.980
So this.

40:16.980 --> 40:18.020
Can you dye it another day?

40:19.380 --> 40:22.340
This Yahoo is sent in by the wizard, Emma Cant.

40:22.340 --> 40:23.460
What do you think about that?

40:23.460 --> 40:24.740
Ooh, okay.

40:25.460 --> 40:26.420
Emma, thank you.

40:26.420 --> 40:27.460
It's an anonymous Yahoo answer.

40:27.460 --> 40:28.340
Why not a wizard?

40:28.340 --> 40:29.060
Why not a wizard?

40:29.780 --> 40:31.940
This one's by a Yahoo answers user.

40:31.940 --> 40:32.740
They're anonymous.

40:32.740 --> 40:35.620
So I'm going to call them Preston Asks.

40:35.620 --> 40:36.980
Oh, like Presta Digitation.

40:38.180 --> 40:38.500
What?

40:39.140 --> 40:42.580
Like Presta Digitation would be my wizard.

40:42.580 --> 40:47.780
My name is Preston Digitation and I'm here to change the world of wrestling.

40:48.580 --> 40:51.140
I also flip real good.

40:51.140 --> 40:52.740
Look at these flips.

40:52.740 --> 40:55.140
They are not magically enhanced.

40:55.140 --> 40:56.740
They're physical flips.

40:56.740 --> 40:58.740
And also lightning.

40:58.740 --> 40:59.540
That's hard.

40:59.540 --> 41:03.940
That's hard if you practice really hard to do cool flips as the wizard wrestler.

41:03.940 --> 41:07.940
You have to keep reassuring people that, no, I train to do those.

41:09.940 --> 41:11.620
Preston Asks.

41:12.740 --> 41:18.260
If you could combine two sports to make a new sport, which two would you pick and why?

41:18.260 --> 41:21.220
There's room right now for a new sport to take off.

41:22.020 --> 41:24.100
Football and jousting.

41:24.740 --> 41:25.700
Football and jousting.

41:25.700 --> 41:29.700
Travis did not even think about it before he went for football and jousting,

41:29.700 --> 41:33.460
which is kind of like polo, sort of.

41:33.460 --> 41:34.260
Walk me through it, Trav.

41:34.260 --> 41:34.980
What's it look like?

41:34.980 --> 41:39.060
Well, it's you have the big linemen, but they also have big pointy sticks.

41:39.620 --> 41:40.980
Does anybody else have big-

41:40.980 --> 41:41.940
Are they on horseback?

41:42.900 --> 41:47.140
No, the wide receivers and the running backs are sitting on the lineman's shoulders.

41:47.940 --> 41:49.300
Oh, so they're playing like chickens.

41:49.300 --> 41:51.060
Like at a pool, but they have-

41:51.060 --> 41:52.580
But they have big sticks.

41:52.580 --> 41:53.780
Big pointy sticks.

41:53.780 --> 41:56.660
Also, what about water polo and regular polo?

41:57.460 --> 41:58.180
That's cool.

41:58.820 --> 42:00.180
Now there's horses in the pool.

42:00.740 --> 42:01.540
Yeah.

42:01.540 --> 42:03.940
And don't get me wrong, the pool is shallower.

42:03.940 --> 42:05.540
The horses can touch the bottom.

42:06.660 --> 42:07.780
The horses aren't swimming.

42:08.580 --> 42:12.180
So, but yeah, you've basically created the most dangerous sport

42:12.180 --> 42:16.180
for if you do fall off the horse and get trampled underwater.

42:16.180 --> 42:17.780
That's a duncey right there.

42:18.740 --> 42:19.780
That's the season wrap.

42:19.780 --> 42:29.700
Yeah, let's think about this because I think there's some sports that could serve as like

42:29.700 --> 42:33.700
a really exciting modifier for virtually every other sport.

42:34.500 --> 42:41.620
I think if we took NASCAR and blended it with literally anything else-

42:41.620 --> 42:42.340
Jousting.

42:43.460 --> 42:44.340
That's rough.

42:44.340 --> 42:48.100
I'm trying to think of the safety of the athletes, Trav, and I guess I'm alone in that.

42:48.100 --> 42:49.860
Okay, well then soccer, but with cars.

42:49.860 --> 42:51.300
No, that's a game, isn't it?

42:51.300 --> 42:52.020
It's a game.

42:52.020 --> 42:52.820
Yeah, I think so.

42:55.380 --> 42:56.180
You know what?

42:56.180 --> 42:57.780
I'm gonna say, okay, picture this.

42:58.340 --> 42:59.700
NASCAR, right?

43:00.340 --> 43:01.380
They're going real fast.

43:02.100 --> 43:06.980
But in order to win, you have to hit a ramp, pass by a basketball net,

43:06.980 --> 43:09.140
and slam dunk it out of the car window.

43:09.140 --> 43:10.020
That's cool.

43:10.020 --> 43:11.380
See, now we're talking.

43:11.380 --> 43:11.940
Yeah, right?

43:13.300 --> 43:17.140
I think NASCAR and just, can I just say the X Games?

43:17.140 --> 43:17.860
X Games?

43:17.860 --> 43:18.360
Huh.

43:19.220 --> 43:24.900
I would love to see a snowboarding car, like replace the wheels, I guess with like rails,

43:24.900 --> 43:25.620
like skis.

43:26.340 --> 43:27.140
Yeah.

43:27.140 --> 43:28.820
And now they're doing a big jump.

43:28.820 --> 43:29.860
I like the big jumps.

43:31.380 --> 43:35.460
I mean, boxing and any other sport is like, but they fight.

43:35.460 --> 43:37.700
It's like baseball, but they fight.

43:37.700 --> 43:40.580
Well, they already fight in baseball sometimes, but they're not supposed to.

43:40.580 --> 43:42.020
But you can win.

43:42.020 --> 43:42.260
Yeah.

43:42.260 --> 43:50.020
You play baseball and you're doing great, but say the Angels are down, nine zip,

43:50.020 --> 43:52.100
bottom of the ninth, and they're like, hey, wait a minute.

43:52.820 --> 43:55.060
Let's just fucking get these guys.

43:55.060 --> 43:58.820
And so you go over there and you just start punching the other people in the dugout

43:58.820 --> 44:03.940
until the ump is like, game, Angels, come from behind, victory.

44:03.940 --> 44:04.440
Okay.

44:04.980 --> 44:05.860
Here's my pitch.

44:05.860 --> 44:06.660
Here's my pitch.

44:06.660 --> 44:07.380
This is my pitch.

44:07.380 --> 44:12.500
Okay, combine every sport individually, not like into one big mass.

44:12.500 --> 44:18.260
I'm saying like this, like with capture the flag where you're playing baseball,

44:18.260 --> 44:20.900
but also in each dugout, right?

44:20.900 --> 44:22.020
There's a flag.

44:22.020 --> 44:25.700
And if the other team is distracted and you can get over there and get it.

44:25.700 --> 44:28.420
Same with like football, there's a flag on the sidelines.

44:28.420 --> 44:30.180
Soccer, there's a flag in the side.

44:30.180 --> 44:31.940
Like there's just a flag.

44:31.940 --> 44:36.100
But if you can get their flag back over to your side while they're busy playing the game,

44:36.100 --> 44:36.820
you win.

44:36.820 --> 44:38.020
It's gotta be baseball, right?

44:38.020 --> 44:39.300
Because I'm thinking about it now.

44:39.300 --> 44:43.860
Every other like of the major sports has had the sexier version made of it.

44:43.860 --> 44:45.220
We got slam ball for basketball.

44:45.220 --> 44:47.460
We got XFL for NFL.

44:47.460 --> 44:51.540
But baseball, I'm not even thinking of it like NASCAR can modify everything better.

44:51.540 --> 44:54.820
I'm thinking about baseball needs of that sauce.

44:54.820 --> 44:55.540
What's it need?

44:55.540 --> 44:55.940
Yeah.

44:55.940 --> 44:57.460
It needs a little bit of that sauce.

44:57.460 --> 45:02.820
And I think having some other sort of excitement on top of baseball is the secret.

45:02.820 --> 45:03.540
I got a good one.

45:03.540 --> 45:04.040
Okay.

45:04.040 --> 45:08.680
So, shot put and curling.

45:08.680 --> 45:09.180
Ooh.

45:09.960 --> 45:10.760
No, wait.

45:10.760 --> 45:11.800
Yes, no.

45:11.800 --> 45:12.920
Yes, I got it.

45:12.920 --> 45:14.520
Discus and curling.

45:15.080 --> 45:17.240
So you're doing your curling, right?

45:18.120 --> 45:20.280
And you're scooting the thing down the pipe.

45:20.280 --> 45:30.200
And then at any moment, someone could come scoop up your disc and hurl it as far as they can.

45:30.200 --> 45:33.320
And then your sport has stopped and their sport has begun.

45:33.320 --> 45:37.960
So you have to get it over across before someone can storm out of the darkness

45:37.960 --> 45:40.680
and take your disc and throw it as far as they can.

45:40.680 --> 45:41.180
Okay.

45:41.180 --> 45:41.960
That's neat.

45:41.960 --> 45:42.760
That's a neat idea.

45:42.760 --> 45:45.400
In fact, shot put plus anything is very good.

45:45.400 --> 45:45.880
That is true.

45:45.880 --> 45:49.080
Like you could be playing football and you're like holding the ball,

45:49.080 --> 45:51.960
but you better pass it quick or else someone's gonna,

45:51.960 --> 45:56.440
a strong person's gonna run out of the shadows and grab it as far as they can.

45:56.440 --> 45:57.800
And it won't be in a way you like.

45:57.800 --> 46:02.360
I am pretty sure American football is soccer plus shot put, right?

46:02.360 --> 46:03.080
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

46:03.080 --> 46:04.520
I'm gonna kick the ball.

46:04.520 --> 46:06.760
No, wait, that guy grabbed it and threw it.

46:06.760 --> 46:09.560
There's always just big fellas trying to take the ball away from you.

46:09.560 --> 46:10.840
That's sort of like inherent.

46:10.840 --> 46:13.080
That's like an important facet of the sport.

46:13.080 --> 46:13.720
What about?

46:13.720 --> 46:14.840
I got a great one.

46:14.840 --> 46:15.480
Okay.

46:15.480 --> 46:22.760
What about cross country skiing and rifle shooting?

46:23.400 --> 46:26.520
Oh, is this the most dangerous game kind of thing?

46:27.160 --> 46:28.760
No, you wouldn't be shooting at each other.

46:28.760 --> 46:33.240
You would cross country ski for a while and go for a long time.

46:33.240 --> 46:37.640
And so you're kind of racing like that, but then you get to like a target range

46:37.640 --> 46:40.280
where then you have to shoot a bunch of targets with your rifle.

46:41.080 --> 46:43.560
And then you set it down and you just keep on skiing, baby.

46:45.000 --> 46:49.080
Okay, so what's the addition here?

46:49.960 --> 46:50.840
What do you mean?

46:50.840 --> 46:52.680
Like how is this improving both sports?

46:52.680 --> 46:57.320
Um, cause you're watching people cross country ski and then you're like,

46:57.320 --> 46:58.680
this is getting boring.

46:58.680 --> 46:59.960
Whoa, what are they doing?

46:59.960 --> 47:01.560
And then they get out a rifle and they're like,

47:01.560 --> 47:06.200
Now there is downhill skiing with lasers, right?

47:08.680 --> 47:09.800
I'm doing a joke.

47:10.680 --> 47:11.720
You fucking guys.

47:11.720 --> 47:14.120
I'm doing a joke because it's called the biathlon.

47:14.120 --> 47:15.000
It's a thing that exists.

47:15.000 --> 47:17.720
But you weren't even, sometimes I do fucking,

47:17.720 --> 47:19.800
sometimes I do a fucking joke on this show.

47:19.800 --> 47:22.920
And it like doesn't work because you guys don't get it.

47:23.480 --> 47:25.320
Jokes interesting jokes and interesting.

47:25.320 --> 47:26.520
It makes me pretty pissed.

47:26.520 --> 47:29.400
It makes me pretty pissed off if I'm being honest.

47:29.400 --> 47:30.200
Oh no, wait, I've got it.

47:30.200 --> 47:32.840
Wait, before we go on baseball and ballroom dancing.

47:32.840 --> 47:37.960
You catch the ball and then you have to do a little dance and you get judged on it.

47:37.960 --> 47:41.400
And you hit the ball and you have to do a little dance before you can run.

47:41.400 --> 47:45.720
Or you do the dance while you're running and you got a samba to the first base.

47:45.720 --> 47:47.320
You got a rumba to second base.

47:47.320 --> 47:53.000
You got a tango to third.

47:53.000 --> 47:54.040
I want to munch.

47:54.040 --> 47:54.540
Squad.

47:57.080 --> 47:59.160
I want to munch.

47:59.160 --> 47:59.660
Squad.

48:02.680 --> 48:03.320
Welcome to Munch Squad.

48:03.320 --> 48:06.200
It's a podcast within a podcast about the latest and greatest of brand eating.

48:06.200 --> 48:06.680
I'm going to-

48:06.680 --> 48:08.600
Did you say brain eating?

48:08.600 --> 48:09.320
Brand eating.

48:09.320 --> 48:14.600
I'm trying to do more headlines right now because there's not as many deep dives,

48:14.600 --> 48:16.840
but there are some things that I do want to pass on.

48:16.840 --> 48:17.240
Okay.

48:17.240 --> 48:17.640
To you.

48:17.640 --> 48:20.040
Wienerschnitzel is a chain-

48:20.040 --> 48:21.240
You taste it right from that mouth?

48:21.880 --> 48:27.000
Wienerschnitzel announces lineup for new cheesy Oozefest.

48:27.000 --> 48:29.320
Oh fuck, Wienerschnitzel.

48:29.320 --> 48:30.520
Steal yourself.

48:30.520 --> 48:34.600
Oozefest has arrived at Wienerschnitzel and it's going to be epic.

48:35.240 --> 48:39.400
Experience unsurpassed deliciousness with the chain's new cheese sauce

48:39.400 --> 48:41.880
taking the spotlight of three fan favorites.

48:41.880 --> 48:48.440
It later said, it says in the quote, and this is from the CMO of Wienerschnitzel,

48:48.440 --> 48:51.480
Doug Kokobohen,

48:52.440 --> 48:56.280
we're confident our Oozefest event will be a big hit.

48:57.080 --> 49:00.440
If you like cheese, you're going to love these.

49:01.880 --> 49:04.760
After one bite, you'll be requesting an encore.

49:04.760 --> 49:05.800
Oh God.

49:05.800 --> 49:08.920
I assume after this he said, are any of those anything?

49:08.920 --> 49:10.360
I have other things to do.

49:10.360 --> 49:14.520
Other things to do, and the press release says, no need to trek to a desert

49:14.520 --> 49:17.160
to experience these amazing headliners.

49:17.160 --> 49:19.240
That possibility had not occurred to me, Wienerschnitzel.

49:19.240 --> 49:21.480
Why would I go there, Wienerschnitzel?

49:21.480 --> 49:24.840
Because this tasty trio will be touring your nearest Wienerschnitzel,

49:24.840 --> 49:25.960
but for a limited time only.

49:25.960 --> 49:28.120
Where did the desert come from?

49:28.120 --> 49:29.400
I guess it's a Burning Man thing.

49:29.400 --> 49:30.360
What's the desert?

49:30.360 --> 49:32.840
That's the festival that Wienerschnitzel has heard about.

49:32.840 --> 49:36.440
Hey Justin, is it E-W-W-S?

49:36.440 --> 49:38.120
Ooze?

49:38.120 --> 49:39.080
Fucking got him.

49:39.080 --> 49:42.200
This is a very brief one because it's just a sad story, but I do.

49:42.200 --> 49:44.760
This is in the general actual news category.

49:46.280 --> 49:53.720
Taco Bell was not done with their absolutely like slash and burn crusade

49:53.720 --> 49:55.640
against their own shit.

49:55.640 --> 49:57.800
Their scorched earth policy?

49:57.800 --> 50:01.400
Yeah, the final revamp of 2020.

50:01.400 --> 50:03.000
We're just doing empty shells.

50:03.560 --> 50:04.920
No, they're getting rid of...

50:04.920 --> 50:09.960
They're getting rid of Mexican pizza.

50:09.960 --> 50:10.460
No!

50:11.960 --> 50:19.480
One of the more authentic dishes at Taco Bell.

50:19.480 --> 50:24.520
They're getting rid of Mexican pizza, they're getting rid of pico de gallo,

50:24.520 --> 50:26.280
and they're getting rid of shredded chicken.

50:26.920 --> 50:30.040
Now if you say you want chicken, you won't be able to specify

50:30.600 --> 50:32.280
that you want that shit shredded.

50:32.280 --> 50:37.080
Uh, you're gonna just only have one style of chicken.

50:37.080 --> 50:37.580
Huh.

50:38.440 --> 50:39.160
Wow.

50:39.160 --> 50:43.560
Removing, um, this is actually gonna trip you out pretty bad.

50:44.840 --> 50:50.120
Taco Bell said removing Mexican pizza will help it leave a lighter footprint

50:50.680 --> 50:58.360
since the Mexican pizza's packaging accounts for more than seven million pounds

50:58.360 --> 51:01.800
of paperboard material per year in the US.

51:01.800 --> 51:04.680
Are you fucking with shit right now?

51:04.680 --> 51:06.920
We're crazy for this pizza.

51:07.480 --> 51:07.980
What?

51:08.840 --> 51:15.160
I want to see a graph now which is like human waste of all year

51:15.160 --> 51:19.320
and then one sliver of it is like a not inconsiderable portion

51:19.320 --> 51:21.400
is Mexican pizza packaging.

51:21.400 --> 51:21.900
Wow.

51:22.760 --> 51:24.200
So that's mind-blowing.

51:24.200 --> 51:27.640
And our last story, rest in peace shredded chicken,

51:27.640 --> 51:32.120
our last story comes to us from the Hershey Company.

51:32.120 --> 51:36.200
The Reese's brand, the Reese's brand is here to save your morning

51:36.200 --> 51:38.360
with the new Reese's snack cakes.

51:38.360 --> 51:44.760
A first of its kind mid-morning cake treat by the Reese's brand you love.

51:45.560 --> 51:46.600
You read that right.

51:47.400 --> 51:53.080
A Reese's treat to enjoy in the morning forever.

51:54.280 --> 51:55.320
That's what it says.

51:55.320 --> 51:56.120
It says forever?

51:56.120 --> 51:58.120
Yep, you read that right.

51:58.120 --> 52:01.720
A Reese's treat to enjoy in the morning forever.

52:01.720 --> 52:04.600
Does that just mean like this is not a limited time thing, friends?

52:04.600 --> 52:05.640
This is call shot.

52:05.640 --> 52:06.140
Forever.

52:06.760 --> 52:08.280
What is a morning cake?

52:08.280 --> 52:16.040
Research shows 83% say they have indulged in dessert before noon in the past month.

52:16.920 --> 52:22.600
Hey Reese's, can you think of any other fucking reason that might be?

52:23.640 --> 52:24.680
You absolutely.

52:24.680 --> 52:27.000
The Colonel is like, no, no, no, careful.

52:27.000 --> 52:27.560
No, no, no.

52:27.560 --> 52:28.520
It's the COVID thing.

52:28.520 --> 52:31.880
I know I ignored it for six months too before I changed finger looking good.

52:31.880 --> 52:32.760
It's the COVID thing.

52:32.760 --> 52:33.880
You're wandering right into it.

52:35.080 --> 52:36.920
So we had a crazy idea.

52:37.800 --> 52:44.280
Give Reese's fans permission to have cake as a mid-morning snack whenever they want.

52:44.280 --> 52:51.960
So Reese's sees us at the bottom of the well in a deep global depression.

52:51.960 --> 52:57.080
Uh-huh and rather than extend ahead and down to us to help us swim out,

52:57.080 --> 53:00.440
it just starts dumping peanut butter and cake onto us.

53:00.440 --> 53:02.200
Like here, we'll help you.

53:02.200 --> 53:03.080
This is helping.

53:03.800 --> 53:04.280
I'm helping.

53:04.280 --> 53:05.080
Here's a shovel.

53:05.080 --> 53:07.080
Dig down, dig down.

53:07.080 --> 53:11.160
There's gotta be something better with Reese's snack cakes.

53:11.160 --> 53:16.600
Reese's fans can enjoy a delicious combination of chocolate and peanut butter cream

53:16.600 --> 53:18.680
without having to wait until lunch.

53:18.680 --> 53:24.200
We wanted to create the perfect treat for Reese's fans to satisfy that mid-morning sweet tooth,

53:25.080 --> 53:27.640
said Mike Orr, Snacks Brand Manager.

53:27.640 --> 53:31.080
We know sometimes you just don't want to wait until lunch.

53:31.080 --> 53:33.160
That's how Reese's snack cakes were born.

53:35.160 --> 53:40.680
It's like the Reese's brand first ever mid-morning treat offers real milk chocolate

53:40.680 --> 53:45.960
Reese's peanut butter cream in a two cake pack available December 2020

53:45.960 --> 53:48.760
at convenience stores nationwide.

53:50.760 --> 53:54.840
Now you can indulge in a Reese's treat any time of day.

53:54.840 --> 53:57.160
Consider morning officially saved.

53:57.160 --> 53:58.760
Hashtag not sorry.

53:58.760 --> 54:00.200
Okay, first of all.

54:00.200 --> 54:00.600
Yeah.

54:00.600 --> 54:01.640
That put it a lot.

54:01.640 --> 54:02.600
That was over the top.

54:02.600 --> 54:04.040
The hashtag was over the top.

54:04.040 --> 54:04.840
It's a lot.

54:04.840 --> 54:09.320
What was stopping me from eating a Reese's cup in the morning?

54:09.320 --> 54:13.640
That's fucking clearly nothing because according to your own fucking research,

54:13.640 --> 54:17.080
83% of us are enjoying a little mid-morning.

54:17.080 --> 54:18.040
So yeah.

54:18.040 --> 54:23.480
So why is now making it a little breadier make it okay for me to do?

54:24.120 --> 54:24.440
Yeah.

54:24.440 --> 54:27.160
And y'all like, listen, you're not looking at these cakes.

54:27.160 --> 54:28.280
They're cakes.

54:28.280 --> 54:32.120
You're not making, this is not like a fucking biscotti.

54:32.120 --> 54:36.040
It's like a layer of cake wrapped in chocolate with Reese's on it.

54:36.040 --> 54:37.720
It's a dessert.

54:37.720 --> 54:41.480
And you're just saying that you can eat it at 10 o'clock in the morning.

54:41.480 --> 54:42.680
That doesn't do anything.

54:42.680 --> 54:44.280
We give you permission.

54:44.280 --> 54:45.240
Oh, I didn't.

54:45.240 --> 54:50.120
I clearly didn't need it when 83% of me was already doing it.

54:50.120 --> 54:52.520
Do you think that 17% was waiting on cake?

54:53.560 --> 54:54.680
They're just waiting for it.

54:54.680 --> 54:58.920
I'd love to eat a Reese's right now, but 17% of us say it's no good.

54:58.920 --> 55:02.120
Maybe those 17% will be swayed by cake.

55:02.120 --> 55:02.440
Possibly.

55:02.440 --> 55:03.320
Perhaps if cake.

55:04.760 --> 55:05.960
That's why I do want it though.

55:05.960 --> 55:06.840
I want it.

55:06.840 --> 55:07.560
I want to eat.

55:07.560 --> 55:09.160
I'm so hungry looking at it.

55:09.160 --> 55:10.120
You have no idea.

55:10.120 --> 55:11.880
I would do anything to eat this cake right now.

55:11.880 --> 55:15.240
I'm going to time travel to December 2020 when it's done so I can eat it.

55:15.240 --> 55:15.560
But you know what?

55:15.560 --> 55:18.120
It's 1.39 and maybe the vaccine too.

55:18.120 --> 55:18.840
You don't know.

55:18.840 --> 55:22.280
We might be having celebratory Reese's snack cakes with a delicious vaccine.

55:22.280 --> 55:23.000
All right, Justin.

55:23.000 --> 55:23.960
You can only have one.

55:23.960 --> 55:24.920
December 2020.

55:24.920 --> 55:25.640
What do you pick?

55:25.640 --> 55:27.800
Oh, the cake for sure.

55:27.800 --> 55:29.080
Because the cake might fix.

55:29.080 --> 55:31.720
The cake, we don't know the cake won't fix.

55:32.600 --> 55:33.880
Yeah, that's true.

55:33.880 --> 55:36.440
The cake definitely isn't a hoax.

55:36.440 --> 55:36.760
Yeah.

55:36.760 --> 55:37.800
Let's just leave it at that.

55:37.800 --> 55:38.520
Jeez.

55:38.520 --> 55:39.080
Oh, boy.

55:39.640 --> 55:40.440
Oh, golly.

55:40.440 --> 55:43.560
I will also wait until Reese's gives me permission to get a vaccine.

55:45.160 --> 55:49.000
But 83% of you are getting mid-morning vaccines.

55:49.960 --> 55:53.240
I'm just waiting for the Reese's scientists to determine that it's safe.

55:53.240 --> 55:57.720
Just so you know, Justin, in the future, if you do bring Wienerschnitzel into the Munch Squad,

55:57.720 --> 56:00.200
I am going to go because I did now.

56:00.200 --> 56:02.120
I was in my hole for a while.

56:02.120 --> 56:07.080
Whenever anybody brings up Wienerschnitzel, I climb into my hole that exists in my fucking

56:07.080 --> 56:14.040
mind palace is a rage hole because Wienerschnitzel is a hot dog restaurant.

56:14.040 --> 56:17.960
And Wienerschnitzel is not a hot dog.

56:17.960 --> 56:19.480
It is a breaded veal cutlet.

56:20.120 --> 56:25.000
And the guy that started Wienerschnitzel was like, I need a name for my hot dog place.

56:25.000 --> 56:30.280
And he was looking in one of his wife's recipe books and saw Wienerschnitzel in there.

56:30.280 --> 56:31.960
He's like, that's a great name.

56:32.520 --> 56:34.120
Got Wiener right there, doesn't it?

56:34.120 --> 56:35.480
It's got Wiener right there in it.

56:35.480 --> 56:39.000
And I hope his wife was like, oh, John, stop.

56:39.000 --> 56:40.200
Look at the picture, John.

56:40.760 --> 56:43.320
I wish you were a more attentive reader and lover.

56:44.360 --> 56:50.040
He said, when you started the restaurant, quote, no one wanted to call their company

56:50.040 --> 56:50.920
Wienerschnitzel.

56:50.920 --> 56:53.800
Three days later, I said, hell, it's better than John's hot dogs.

56:53.800 --> 56:54.440
No, it's not.

56:54.440 --> 56:55.240
It's not?

56:55.240 --> 56:55.800
It's not.

56:55.800 --> 56:56.760
And you know why, John?

56:57.400 --> 57:00.040
Because John's hot dogs has hot dogs in it.

57:00.040 --> 57:04.600
And I'm pretty sure Nathan's Famous Hot Dogs is a very popular brand.

57:04.600 --> 57:08.920
Yep, it's not Nathan's Famous Sushi that sells hot dogs.

57:09.640 --> 57:10.760
They got the name right.

57:10.760 --> 57:11.960
It has the right food in it.

57:13.080 --> 57:17.240
Anyway, apparently they sold Wienerschnitzel for a few months in 2017.

57:17.240 --> 57:19.240
I assume that was just to get me off their case.

57:20.360 --> 57:20.840
Did it work?

57:21.560 --> 57:21.800
Nope.

57:22.440 --> 57:23.960
He could see right through it.

57:23.960 --> 57:25.480
Hey, guys, be quiet for 30 seconds.

57:25.480 --> 57:25.960
Can you do that?

57:25.960 --> 57:26.280
Sure.

57:28.440 --> 57:29.160
Here you go.

57:29.160 --> 57:32.920
Double cheese fries, double cheese chili fries, and a double cheese chili dog.

57:32.920 --> 57:33.720
Enjoy.

57:33.720 --> 57:34.360
Wow.

57:34.360 --> 57:36.840
Everyone seems to love a ooze fest event.

57:36.840 --> 57:39.160
Yeah, we are actually running low on cheese sauce.

57:39.880 --> 57:41.160
Weird, I just made a bunch.

57:42.920 --> 57:43.800
I'll go check it out.

57:46.040 --> 57:48.120
Oh, that explains it.

57:50.760 --> 57:51.480
Cool.

57:51.480 --> 57:57.080
At this point, I should just pause real quick to say that there's a person in a giant hot dog suit

57:57.800 --> 58:03.400
and they've got a jacuzzi tub filled with cheese sauce and they're ladling more into it.

58:03.400 --> 58:04.040
Okay.

58:04.040 --> 58:07.000
And they're about to climb into it and they're wearing a towel

58:07.000 --> 58:08.520
because they're about to get into the cheese sauce.

58:08.520 --> 58:10.600
I'm glad you broke that down for us because I was confused.

58:11.720 --> 58:12.360
Floaties.

58:14.280 --> 58:18.280
The towel has dropped from the hot dog while this young man looks on.

58:19.640 --> 58:23.240
Dive into all the new cheesy goodness during ooze fest at Wienerschnitzel.

58:24.440 --> 58:24.680
So-

58:24.680 --> 58:26.680
Do they reference the hot dog's genitals?

58:26.680 --> 58:28.440
Do they say, does the dude like-

58:28.440 --> 58:30.920
Wouldn't it be amazing if it had another smaller hot dog?

58:30.920 --> 58:32.760
I mean, that's what it has to be, Justin.

58:32.760 --> 58:33.880
Has to be, has to be.

58:33.880 --> 58:34.280
Has to be.

58:34.280 --> 58:35.080
Thank you for listening.

58:35.080 --> 58:41.640
The employee pushes his sunglasses down the bridge of his nose like, oh yeah.

58:41.640 --> 58:42.920
Thank you for listening to My Brother.

58:43.480 --> 58:45.960
You don't work there if you don't find hot dogs sexy.

58:45.960 --> 58:47.160
Thanks for listening to-

58:47.960 --> 58:52.120
I would actually think you can't work there without later finding-

58:52.120 --> 58:54.440
Like you just handle them so much.

58:54.440 --> 58:55.880
It's going to creep its way into your brain.

58:55.880 --> 58:57.560
Let this end.

58:57.560 --> 59:00.120
This has been My Brother, My Brother Meets and My Show for the Modern Era.

59:00.120 --> 59:01.320
Thank you so much for listening.

59:01.320 --> 59:04.680
We so appreciate you being here.

59:04.680 --> 59:09.560

59:09.560 --> 59:11.720

59:11.720 --> 59:13.160
We got hilarious bee pins back-

59:13.160 --> 59:14.040
Throw those out.

59:14.040 --> 59:15.400
Fuck those again.

59:15.400 --> 59:15.960
So funny.

59:18.360 --> 59:20.280

59:43.240 --> 59:46.360

59:46.360 --> 59:47.080
Doesn't have games.

59:47.720 --> 59:50.440
Thanks to John Roderick and the Long Winters for using our theme song.

59:50.920 --> 59:53.240
It's a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:11.240
Oh, and check out The Besties if you haven't.

01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:17.960
It's mine and Justin's favorite game podcast that we do with our buds, Russ and Chris.

01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:19.640
You can find it on Spotify for free.

01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:20.920
Check it out.

01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:22.920
The last episode we did was on a bunch of games.

01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:23.640
It was a lot of fun.

01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:25.400
You want the final?

01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:26.680
Oh, yeah.

01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:29.240
This final one was sent in by the wizard, Emma Cant.

01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:29.720
Thank you, Emma.

01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:33.720
It's a Yahoo Answers user, Brian, whose fucking profile picture

01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:37.080
is a very intimidating close up of Santa Claus.

01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:38.760
Like he's got this.

01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:43.480
He actually has his little Santa Claus spectacles pushed down the bridge of his nose,

01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:45.480
as if he's saying like, oh, yeah.

01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:48.360
Yeah, I love that hot dog's wiener.

01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:56.840
So Brian asks, can I order a Subway sandwich deconstructed?

01:00:57.800 --> 01:00:58.760
My name is Justin.

01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:00.120
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:02.120
We talk about Subway a lot, don't we?

01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:03.000
They do salads.

01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:05.000
This has been My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:05.480
That's Griffin.

01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:07.480
Kiss your dad, squirt on the lips.
