WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:49.360
It's time for the record. You don't get anything for free in this world.

00:50.960 --> 00:54.000
We are cutting you off. This is no exception.

00:54.000 --> 00:58.480
44 episodes in, the bill is due. The bill is due, bitches!

00:58.480 --> 01:02.880
It's my brother, my brother and me, an advice show for the modern era.

01:02.880 --> 01:04.800
You gots to pay the piper.

01:04.800 --> 01:11.920
Time to pay the piper, sluts. Welcome to the greatest pledge episode ever.

01:13.200 --> 01:16.720
This is the best little, the best little pledge episode in Texas,

01:16.720 --> 01:20.480
is what we're calling this one. This is my brother, my brother and me,

01:20.480 --> 01:25.680
it's an advice show for the modern era. I am Justin McElroy, your oldest brother.

01:25.680 --> 01:29.840
I'm Travis McElroy and we want your money. If you want to know my name,

01:29.840 --> 01:34.240
it's going to cost you like two bucks. It's actually, it's Griffin.

01:35.040 --> 01:40.240
If you want that last name for real, two bucks. So we've got a big episode for you. Lots of fun.

01:40.240 --> 01:45.920
Juicy. It is, it's ripe. It's sagging with juices.

01:45.920 --> 01:50.160
Let's thump this melon. Let's thump this melon.

01:50.160 --> 01:57.520
Like Gallagher too. I live with my boyfriend. When I get home from work,

01:57.520 --> 02:01.040
I like to pretty quickly change into comfy at-home clothing,

02:01.040 --> 02:03.840
pajama pants or yoga pants and a t-shirt of some sort.

02:03.840 --> 02:07.360
Usually this comfy clothing is baggier and less flattering than what I wear

02:07.360 --> 02:09.680
for being out in public. That's why it's comfy.

02:10.560 --> 02:15.200
Am I slowly but surely ruining my relationship and killing my boyfriend's attraction to me

02:15.200 --> 02:18.240
by spending so much time, probably the majority of our time together,

02:18.240 --> 02:22.000
in slouchy clothing. Thanks. Sweats in the city.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.760
That's the best. That's a good one.

02:25.040 --> 02:30.320
I mean, of course you are, right? But it's an expectations game you're playing right now.

02:30.320 --> 02:32.800
You're lowering the bar. Exactly.

02:32.800 --> 02:36.720
I think that if you came home every day and like got more dressed up,

02:36.720 --> 02:41.760
like it's going to lose a lot of the effect. But if you sit around in like scuzzy clothes,

02:41.760 --> 02:46.960
like for a hundred days and then one day like put on some jeans and a t-shirt,

02:46.960 --> 02:49.520
you're going to look awesome. Yeah, hang on.

02:49.520 --> 02:55.760
Do you don't want him to have the pressure of trying to continually outclass you at home

02:56.320 --> 03:02.880
and then it culminates with him wearing a tux and you emerging from a clam shell

03:02.880 --> 03:04.880
when he gets home from work? Like you don't want that.

03:07.120 --> 03:10.080
Do you guys remember what my jam used to be? What was your jam?

03:10.080 --> 03:14.000
Taking your pants off as soon as you got home. Oh my God. I would cross the threshold of our

03:14.000 --> 03:17.280
childhood home and my pants would just disintegrate off of my body.

03:18.320 --> 03:20.720
Our parents went through so many pants bills.

03:20.720 --> 03:26.240
As if by magic, my pants would vanish into the luminescent ether.

03:26.240 --> 03:29.760
Griffin actually invented tear away pants for that very purpose.

03:29.760 --> 03:35.120
I actually I had this trick where I could just like I could stand narrowly.

03:35.120 --> 03:40.320
I could stand with my frame narrowly and my pants would just fall off of my body.

03:40.320 --> 03:42.800
That's not a joke. That was a real thing I could do.

03:42.800 --> 03:48.320
Yeah, so maybe that's a good thing because no pants is about as comfortable as humans get.

03:48.320 --> 03:49.920
And kind of sexy.

03:49.920 --> 03:51.040
Kind of sexy.

03:51.040 --> 03:52.160
Little sexy, little hot.

03:52.880 --> 03:56.480
Listen, young lady, I want to make two really important points.

03:56.480 --> 03:58.720
One, he loves you.

03:58.720 --> 04:04.160
He's going to think that the things that you wear, you know, just around the house or whatever

04:04.720 --> 04:06.880
are adorable because he loves you.

04:06.880 --> 04:09.760
And this is part of being in a loving relationship.

04:09.760 --> 04:11.600
He likes to be cozy, too. He gets it.

04:11.600 --> 04:15.520
Two, if you're worried about the attraction thing, he's a guy, sweetheart.

04:15.520 --> 04:16.400
And you're a girl.

04:16.400 --> 04:19.120
You flash, you flash a boob.

04:19.120 --> 04:20.480
A one boob.

04:20.480 --> 04:21.520
Like half a boob.

04:21.520 --> 04:22.240
Like half a boob.

04:22.240 --> 04:23.040
Take him to the English show.

04:23.040 --> 04:25.040
And you do like a quarter of boob.

04:25.040 --> 04:27.360
You get like a quarter boob and he's down.

04:27.360 --> 04:28.640
He's DTF.

04:28.640 --> 04:30.320
And that's short for down to fuck.

04:30.320 --> 04:34.640
And that is not and that is not something that you acquire over time.

04:34.640 --> 04:36.640
For guys, it's a very instantaneous.

04:36.640 --> 04:37.920
So like, oh, there's a boob.

04:38.560 --> 04:39.760
Time to go.

04:39.760 --> 04:41.520
You know what's always sexy?

04:41.520 --> 04:42.320
What's that?

04:42.320 --> 04:43.360
A robe.

04:43.360 --> 04:44.560
Because it's mysterious.

04:44.560 --> 04:45.280
What's underneath?

04:45.280 --> 04:46.480
That's a good point.

04:46.480 --> 04:47.600
Kind of sexy, right?

04:47.600 --> 04:48.720
I'm robed right now.

04:48.720 --> 04:50.000
I'm wearing a robe.

04:50.000 --> 04:54.800
Teresa and I, like we often have robe dates where it's just like we get home from work

04:54.800 --> 04:58.480
and we've had we've had a long day and it's like, let's robe it up.

04:58.480 --> 05:00.640
And then we watch David Attenborough specials.

05:00.640 --> 05:02.400
I never disrobe before a gunfight.

05:02.400 --> 05:03.120
That's just me.

05:03.680 --> 05:04.160
I don't know.

05:04.160 --> 05:05.040
I don't know where you guys are.

05:06.080 --> 05:07.440
Anybody else you drive angry?

05:07.440 --> 05:08.640
That was a good one.

05:08.640 --> 05:11.600
Yeah, that was a good reference you just made.

05:11.600 --> 05:12.480
I don't like the picture.

05:12.480 --> 05:13.440
Everybody enjoys that.

05:14.240 --> 05:18.560
I can only wear my robe for about an hour or two in the morning because I always feel

05:18.560 --> 05:20.960
like I smell really bad when I'm wearing a robe.

05:20.960 --> 05:24.800
Oh, yeah, it's a cocoon of stink coming off of you.

05:25.520 --> 05:29.920
It's like a second skin that you wear outside of your normal sweaty, stinky skin that absorbs

05:29.920 --> 05:30.560
your stuff.

05:30.560 --> 05:31.440
And then I don't know.

05:31.440 --> 05:34.960
There's something about the way that it just it hangs on my body.

05:34.960 --> 05:36.560
It just seems to funnel.

05:36.560 --> 05:41.360
It seems to funnel like the smell like up and out and in my my nose.

05:41.360 --> 05:42.160
It's really bad.

05:42.880 --> 05:43.760
Do you bathe?

05:44.320 --> 05:45.280
Yeah, I bathe.

05:46.080 --> 05:49.280
I mean, did you say you bathed or you bathe?

05:49.280 --> 05:50.960
Like, what's our tense?

05:50.960 --> 05:52.240
Let's take a tense check.

05:52.240 --> 05:53.280
I'm familiar.

05:54.800 --> 05:55.300
Right.

05:56.160 --> 05:57.520
I'm terrified.

05:57.520 --> 06:01.120
I have this friend who's been dating this guy on and off four different times now.

06:01.120 --> 06:04.000
Every time by the end, they seem to hate each other.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.800
But then two months or so, they're dating again.

06:06.800 --> 06:10.560
How can I tell my friend to just give up on him?

06:10.560 --> 06:11.200
P.S.

06:11.200 --> 06:12.400
My friend's a girl.

06:12.400 --> 06:13.200
That's from Brandon.

06:17.200 --> 06:21.760
I used to have the theory that like once a couple broke up, they're broken up.

06:21.760 --> 06:23.920
Yeah, like there's no coming back from that.

06:23.920 --> 06:27.280
Now, everybody listening is going to say, but I know this one guy.

06:27.280 --> 06:27.600
Great.

06:27.600 --> 06:28.720
Yeah, you know the exception.

06:28.720 --> 06:29.600
That's awesome.

06:29.600 --> 06:33.920
But I'm saying as a rule, like once you break up, how do you come

06:33.920 --> 06:34.560
back from that?

06:34.560 --> 06:38.000
Like, especially after two months, it's like, oh, hey, want to go at this again?

06:38.000 --> 06:39.760
I didn't work out this time either.

06:39.760 --> 06:40.560
Whoops.

06:40.560 --> 06:43.920
It's like forgetting the ending of a book and then rereading the book and going, oh,

06:43.920 --> 06:44.720
fuck, they die.

06:44.720 --> 06:45.520
That's right.

06:45.520 --> 06:46.960
Your relationship sucks.

06:46.960 --> 06:48.240
Don't get back into it.

06:48.240 --> 06:53.440
Yeah, I think Travis makes a great point because one time I the first girl I ever dated, we

06:53.440 --> 06:57.680
dated for a couple of months and then we split up for reasons that aren't exactly clear.

06:57.680 --> 06:59.920
And then later I married her.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.120
What are you doing?

07:01.120 --> 07:04.720
You fucking monster.

07:04.720 --> 07:05.600
I'm the other guy.

07:05.600 --> 07:06.240
I'm the thing.

07:06.240 --> 07:07.120
I'm the thing here.

07:07.120 --> 07:08.000
I'm the guy here.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.440
I'm not an exception of telling you.

07:09.440 --> 07:10.240
You're crazy.

07:10.240 --> 07:11.440
You're the exception, Travis.

07:11.440 --> 07:12.160
You're the exception.

07:12.160 --> 07:13.680
I'm the exception.

07:13.680 --> 07:15.280
Have you ever dated a girl twice?

07:15.280 --> 07:15.920
Oh, yeah.

07:15.920 --> 07:16.160
Okay.

07:16.160 --> 07:17.280
So just Travis then.

07:17.280 --> 07:19.280
Travis is out on his own on this one.

07:19.280 --> 07:21.280
And let me tell you how well Griffin turned out.

07:21.280 --> 07:23.040
Might work out really well, yeah.

07:24.720 --> 07:27.360
I would say that we're 50, 50, 50 here.

07:27.360 --> 07:31.520
I think that's fair.

07:32.240 --> 07:33.120
I don't know.

07:33.120 --> 07:38.000
I think that, I don't know, it can really go either way because maybe sometimes you

07:38.000 --> 07:44.400
break up and that breakup period, that brief breakup makes you realize that you need that

07:44.400 --> 07:47.520
person and that you've changed and that you've grown.

07:48.160 --> 07:49.520
Yeah, you've grown and evolved.

07:49.520 --> 07:50.560
Have you grown?

07:50.560 --> 07:54.880
Okay, but we're giving advice to the person breaking up and getting back together.

07:54.880 --> 07:56.560
Four times is a little excessive.

07:56.560 --> 07:56.880
Yeah.

07:56.880 --> 08:01.120
This guy's asking how does he tell his friend to end it?

08:02.720 --> 08:03.920
I don't think you can.

08:03.920 --> 08:04.960
I don't think you do.

08:04.960 --> 08:05.920
What do you care?

08:05.920 --> 08:07.040
Why are you, why do you care?

08:08.080 --> 08:08.800
You got to jettison now.

08:08.800 --> 08:12.400
All you could do is be really passive aggressive and like when they come back and be like,

08:12.400 --> 08:13.520
oh, I got back together with him.

08:13.520 --> 08:15.040
Just go, oh, really?

08:15.040 --> 08:16.800
Huh, huh, huh.

08:16.800 --> 08:18.240
That's, that's all you could do.

08:19.120 --> 08:19.920
We broke up.

08:19.920 --> 08:21.440
Oh, did you break up?

08:21.440 --> 08:23.200
So treat it like it's not a thing at all.

08:23.200 --> 08:26.720
And then he's probably just doing it for the attention or she is, you know?

08:26.720 --> 08:28.160
That's a good, yeah, that's good.

08:28.160 --> 08:29.120
We're back in it now.

08:30.160 --> 08:30.960
You got to disengage.

08:30.960 --> 08:32.960
Four times sounds like they're like 15.

08:35.040 --> 08:37.920
You got to disengage from this relationship, from their relationship.

08:37.920 --> 08:40.400
You got to say like, oh, whatever, she's doing this with this guy.

08:41.280 --> 08:42.800
It has no bearing on me.

08:43.600 --> 08:44.800
That, that is what you should say.

08:46.160 --> 08:48.000
Because it's, that way lies madness.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.240
Like getting all up in other people's cream.

08:50.240 --> 08:51.440
Like you don't need that.

08:51.440 --> 08:54.080
Also, you run the risk of really sounding like an asshole.

08:54.080 --> 08:54.960
Like, you know what I mean?

08:54.960 --> 08:59.040
Like if your friend's not looking for the advice there, then you just want to stay out.

08:59.040 --> 08:59.840
It's a loser.

08:59.840 --> 09:01.120
It's a, it's a, it's a real loser.

09:01.120 --> 09:02.320
You don't, you don't need it.

09:02.320 --> 09:03.520
Speaking of loser.

09:03.520 --> 09:04.800
Speaking of loser.

09:04.800 --> 09:05.600
Let's talk about winners.

09:05.600 --> 09:06.720
How about a Yahoo?

09:06.720 --> 09:07.220
Yes.

09:09.360 --> 09:12.240
This one was sent in by Vikram Murugaval.

09:12.240 --> 09:13.680
I prayed to Jesus.

09:13.680 --> 09:14.400
I said that right.

09:15.280 --> 09:16.560
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

09:17.280 --> 09:19.840
Not that Vikram Murugaval likely believes in Jesus.

09:19.840 --> 09:20.720
He sounds like a heathen.

09:21.680 --> 09:22.180
Okay.

09:23.520 --> 09:24.560
He sounds like a pagan.

09:24.560 --> 09:25.600
Is he a pagan?

09:25.600 --> 09:26.240
I think he's a pagan.

09:26.240 --> 09:28.880
There's that one racist thing we say every episode I have to edit out.

09:30.560 --> 09:35.280
This one is, this one's by Yahoo Answers user Dragon101 who asks,

09:37.680 --> 09:38.480
I'm a dragon.

09:39.200 --> 09:39.700
Okay.

09:40.080 --> 09:42.640
But I don't know how to summon my special skills.

09:42.640 --> 09:45.120
I can do some things unordinary.

09:45.120 --> 09:46.160
Anyone have ideas?

09:47.680 --> 09:52.160
This is kind of new and also confusing for my age that is.

09:52.160 --> 09:54.880
I can tell you right now that I'm under 21.

09:54.880 --> 09:58.240
Anyone have ideas on what I could do because I'm a dragon?

09:58.240 --> 09:58.740
Please.

09:59.840 --> 10:03.360
Well, this is the age old question of is it a mental thing?

10:03.360 --> 10:05.360
Is there a muscle that you flex?

10:05.360 --> 10:06.560
Is there an incantation?

10:07.120 --> 10:08.880
It's age old questions, you know?

10:09.600 --> 10:11.520
And really it's different strokes for different folks.

10:11.520 --> 10:16.400
Like for me, for me, it's all muscular.

10:17.600 --> 10:18.480
I've had to tone.

10:18.480 --> 10:20.800
I've had to develop.

10:20.800 --> 10:22.240
You've had to kegel?

10:22.240 --> 10:27.040
I've had to kegel my dragon muscles to the point where I can, you know,

10:27.040 --> 10:29.840
execute my unordinary abilities.

10:29.840 --> 10:33.840
But the thing is 21, that's kind of a little late to the game.

10:33.840 --> 10:34.400
You are.

10:34.400 --> 10:39.520
You're getting a late start to learning your Drachen in the old tongue.

10:39.520 --> 10:41.040
Your draconic.

10:41.040 --> 10:43.360
Your draconic abilities.

10:43.360 --> 10:45.360
Because I mean, that's a weird age.

10:45.360 --> 10:46.320
Dragon of Puberty.

10:46.320 --> 10:48.960
Like, I hit mine in middle school.

10:48.960 --> 10:50.400
I was kind of an early bloomer.

10:50.400 --> 10:55.280
You know, some things just hit me in the third age, but it was a long time ago.

10:55.280 --> 10:56.240
Oh, okay.

10:56.240 --> 10:56.740
Yeah.

10:56.740 --> 11:02.720
I just become, I just became so terrified because I just realized that dragons have

11:02.720 --> 11:06.960
learned to use the internet and we've lost our one vantage.

11:06.960 --> 11:10.080
The one thing we had that they didn't.

11:10.080 --> 11:13.920
I don't know how to break this to you, but one out of every four people you talk to or

11:13.920 --> 11:16.640
meet on the internet is a dragon.

11:16.640 --> 11:18.640
Holy shit.

11:18.640 --> 11:20.640
Is that a velociraptor noise?

11:20.640 --> 11:22.640
Travis, oh shit.

11:22.640 --> 11:24.640
Travis is one of them.

11:24.640 --> 11:26.640
I didn't know this was a dragon cast.

11:26.640 --> 11:28.640
If dragons aren't using the internet, then explain TMZ.

11:28.640 --> 11:30.640
You can't.

11:30.640 --> 11:32.640
It can't be done.

11:32.640 --> 11:34.640
Made by, made by, gossip by dragons for dragons.

11:34.640 --> 11:36.640
Perez Hilton, half dragon.

11:36.640 --> 11:38.640
What does a dragon keyboard look like?

11:38.640 --> 11:40.640
Do you think it has runes?

11:40.640 --> 11:42.640
I think it has runes.

11:42.640 --> 11:43.140
I think it's very runic.

11:43.140 --> 11:45.140
I think it's made out of, like, lute.

11:45.140 --> 11:47.140
What?

11:47.140 --> 11:49.140
It's made out of what?

11:49.140 --> 11:51.140
It's made out of lute, like dragon lute.

11:51.140 --> 11:53.140
Dragons have hoards, right?

11:53.140 --> 11:55.140
Just full of, like, jewels and gold.

11:55.140 --> 11:57.140
Travis, a lute.

11:57.140 --> 11:59.140
Oh, L-O-O-T, not L-U-T-E.

11:59.140 --> 12:01.140
You think he made several little stringed instruments?

12:01.140 --> 12:03.140
Like, that's what his keyboard was made out of?

12:03.140 --> 12:05.140
I couldn't, I couldn't, I couldn't.

12:05.140 --> 12:05.640
Like Sting?

12:05.640 --> 12:07.140
Like Sting plays?

12:07.140 --> 12:07.640
Yes.

12:07.640 --> 12:09.640
Sting is a dragon?

12:09.640 --> 12:11.640
Sorry, Travis.

12:11.640 --> 12:13.640
Sorry, I didn't, I didn't mean to, uh...

12:13.640 --> 12:17.640
I'm sending out an SOS of sadness.

12:17.640 --> 12:19.640
Aww, don't be sad.

12:19.640 --> 12:21.640
It's just Sting.

12:21.640 --> 12:23.640
I know.

12:23.640 --> 12:25.640
How do you...

12:25.640 --> 12:29.640
I can't remember how I dealt with the pressure of being a teenage dragon.

12:29.640 --> 12:31.640
I made a Disney movie out of it.

12:31.640 --> 12:33.640
And it was called How to Deal with the Pressure of Being a Teenage Dragon?

12:33.640 --> 12:35.640
Yeah, it wasn't very popular.

12:35.640 --> 12:37.640
Yeah?

12:37.640 --> 12:39.640
Speaking of dragons,

12:39.640 --> 12:41.640
Uh, it's...

12:41.640 --> 12:43.640
We need your fire.

12:43.640 --> 12:45.640
For the Maximum Fun Pledge Drive.

12:45.640 --> 12:47.640
It's pledge week.

12:47.640 --> 12:49.640
We want you to rush, rush My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

12:49.640 --> 12:51.640
Pledge our frat.

12:51.640 --> 12:53.640
Our fraternity of chuckles.

12:53.640 --> 12:55.640
Can we haze our listeners?

12:55.640 --> 12:57.640
I think this is a hazing.

12:57.640 --> 12:59.640
Every week's a hazing here at My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

12:59.640 --> 13:03.640
Uh, so this is our pledge drive for 2011.

13:03.640 --> 13:08.640
Uh, we're gonna talk a little bit about the network and some of the benefits of donating here in a sec.

13:08.640 --> 13:10.640
But first, just to let you know how this works.

13:10.640 --> 13:12.640
There's a network.

13:12.640 --> 13:14.640
It's family.

13:14.640 --> 13:16.640
And like a family,

13:16.640 --> 13:18.640
Daddy's got to get paid.

13:18.640 --> 13:20.640
And so...

13:20.640 --> 13:22.640
And Daddy, in this case, our daddy,

13:22.640 --> 13:24.640
is the Maximum Fun Network.

13:24.640 --> 13:28.640
And you, uh, find folks who enjoy the programming here,

13:28.640 --> 13:30.640
uh, pay for us to make it.

13:30.640 --> 13:34.640
You pay to help us buy, uh, equipment.

13:34.640 --> 13:36.640
You pay to help us run our website.

13:36.640 --> 13:38.640
And you pay to help us host our shows.

13:38.640 --> 13:40.640
And you're paying for it.

13:40.640 --> 13:44.640
I like to think of it like a medieval patronage.

13:44.640 --> 13:46.640
How's that? How's that work?

13:46.640 --> 13:48.640
We're like kept people.

13:48.640 --> 13:50.640
We're like serfs.

13:50.640 --> 13:52.640
Yeah, I was gonna say, I feel kind of serf-ish.

13:52.640 --> 13:58.640
It's more like how the king would want Mozart to write a piece for him.

13:58.640 --> 14:00.640
This is not medieval times, of course, anymore.

14:00.640 --> 14:02.640
So we're like Da Vinci.

14:02.640 --> 14:04.640
We're like Da Vinci, basically.

14:04.640 --> 14:06.640
And this show is like our Sistine Chapel.

14:06.640 --> 14:10.640
We're like Da Vinci, but better at drawings.

14:10.640 --> 14:12.640
Yeah, I think it's an accurate way to put it.

14:12.640 --> 14:14.640
So, Griffin, can you tell them a little bit about, uh,

14:14.640 --> 14:16.640
why they should donate? Why it's so important?

14:16.640 --> 14:18.640
Well, I'm working on this helicopter.

14:18.640 --> 14:20.640
Like kind of a Worley gig helicopter

14:20.640 --> 14:26.640
made out of, uh, parchment and wood framing.

14:26.640 --> 14:28.640
And it's an expensive project.

14:28.640 --> 14:30.640
I want to make a man fly.

14:30.640 --> 14:32.640
Can you help me make a man fly with wood framing?

14:32.640 --> 14:34.640
I'm making parchment wings.

14:34.640 --> 14:36.640
Parchment wings.

14:36.640 --> 14:38.640
Eureka.

14:38.640 --> 14:46.640
We have, donations from listeners is our main, you know, lifeblood.

14:46.640 --> 14:48.640
It's our lifeblood.

14:48.640 --> 14:50.640
It pumps through our veins and gives us strength and energy

14:50.640 --> 14:52.640
to do this thing that we do.

14:52.640 --> 14:54.640
And all the other Maximum Fun podcasts do.

14:54.640 --> 14:58.640
Listen, podcasting is kind of, uh, it's still in its infancy, you know?

14:58.640 --> 15:00.640
It's still fresh. It's still new.

15:00.640 --> 15:02.640
The rule book hasn't been written yet.

15:02.640 --> 15:06.640
Um, and so Maximum Fun, uh, and one of the main reasons we joined Maximum Fun

15:06.640 --> 15:10.640
is because they're doing awesome things.

15:10.640 --> 15:13.640
We're doing awesome things, I guess, because we're part of that family.

15:13.640 --> 15:18.640
But, you know, we cover topics that aren't really covered in other places.

15:18.640 --> 15:24.640
And, you know, we do it in a way that a lot of other forms of programming don't do.

15:24.640 --> 15:29.640
Um, and we fostered this community of, well, we didn't foster.

15:29.640 --> 15:31.640
You know what I'm saying.

15:31.640 --> 15:33.640
Maximum Fun has fostered a community of,

15:33.640 --> 15:35.640
probably the best community on the internet.

15:35.640 --> 15:39.640
I would say, I think that, especially after they fused with my brother,

15:39.640 --> 15:41.640
my brother and me, the Mibimbambinos,

15:41.640 --> 15:46.640
I think that they really, uh, it really is a top flight community.

15:46.640 --> 15:48.640
We gave them that spice, that picante.

15:48.640 --> 15:51.640
With that, like, mmm, what a delicious flavor.

15:51.640 --> 15:53.640
With that last, like, dash of, like, pepper, where you go.

15:53.640 --> 15:54.640
Yeah. Exactly.

15:54.640 --> 15:56.640
You know, it's funny, Griff.

15:56.640 --> 16:01.640
You watch so much stuff on TV and so many movies that is supposed to be funny,

16:01.640 --> 16:04.640
and you think, wow, this doesn't really get me.

16:04.640 --> 16:06.640
You know, this isn't really up my alley.

16:06.640 --> 16:09.640
And then you listen to stuff on Maximum Fun, and it is.

16:09.640 --> 16:14.640
It is sort of, you know, when you find something that you really like,

16:14.640 --> 16:19.640
um, you, you know, you want to support it and show that you're out there listening.

16:19.640 --> 16:21.640
Um, and we need to get that chatter.

16:21.640 --> 16:22.640
What the fuck?

16:22.640 --> 16:23.640
Gotta get that chatter.

16:23.640 --> 16:26.640
You know, it's a cool thing because, I mean,

16:26.640 --> 16:28.640
you can see it in the way that the My Brother, My Brother and Me community

16:28.640 --> 16:31.640
has sort of meshed into the Maximum Fun community,

16:31.640 --> 16:34.640
is that you, it's basically just like a big group of friends.

16:34.640 --> 16:37.640
It's like finding this new big group of friends,

16:37.640 --> 16:42.640
but also that group of friends does, you know, shows.

16:42.640 --> 16:46.640
And they're all, they're friendly shows?

16:46.640 --> 16:48.640
I don't know. I lost my train of thought there.

16:48.640 --> 16:49.640
No, no, you were doing great.

16:49.640 --> 16:52.640
Trev, why don't you tell us, let's get to what people really want to know.

16:52.640 --> 16:54.640
What's in it for me?

16:54.640 --> 16:55.640
What do you get?

16:55.640 --> 16:59.640
Obviously, like the most obvious thing is 44% is banned.

16:59.640 --> 17:00.640
Time to pay up.

17:00.640 --> 17:01.640
Yeah.

17:01.640 --> 17:02.640
Time to pay the piper.

17:02.640 --> 17:04.640
You can, you can alleviate your guilt.

17:04.640 --> 17:05.640
I know your guilt.

17:05.640 --> 17:08.640
I hope that every week you laugh and you feel guilty.

17:08.640 --> 17:11.640
And after this, you can narrow that down.

17:11.640 --> 17:13.640
You can whittle that down to one of those.

17:13.640 --> 17:16.640
And not only that, but now you can laugh and feel superior

17:16.640 --> 17:18.640
to all those people that didn't donate.

17:18.640 --> 17:20.640
And you can start talking about those freeloaders

17:20.640 --> 17:23.640
and like hating on the lower class.

17:23.640 --> 17:24.640
It's pretty awesome.

17:24.640 --> 17:27.640
But also you get tangible gifts.

17:27.640 --> 17:30.640
There's many different levels of donation.

17:30.640 --> 17:31.640
Bust it out, Travis.

17:31.640 --> 17:35.640
Well, for the $2 or $5 a month level of donation,

17:35.640 --> 17:37.640
you get the Max Fund Membership Card

17:37.640 --> 17:40.640
and access to exclusive episodes of JJGO,

17:40.640 --> 17:43.640
My Brother, My Brother and Me, John Hodgman,

17:43.640 --> 17:45.640
and Stop Podcasting Yourself.

17:45.640 --> 17:48.640
So they're all special episodes that you only get access to

17:48.640 --> 17:50.640
if you're a donor.

17:50.640 --> 17:53.640
And also we've done some RIFT movies,

17:53.640 --> 17:55.640
kind of, you know,

17:55.640 --> 17:59.640
hilarious old-timey 1950s instructional videos.

17:59.640 --> 18:02.640
And we did one, Stop Podcasting Yourself did one,

18:02.640 --> 18:04.640
and Jordan did one,

18:04.640 --> 18:07.640
and Jesse, I'm sure, was in there as well.

18:07.640 --> 18:09.640
So there's that.

18:09.640 --> 18:11.640
Those two also get you stickers.

18:11.640 --> 18:13.640
Would that come with the membership card

18:13.640 --> 18:16.640
that you can, you know, apply to Elisa Frank Trapper Keeper?

18:16.640 --> 18:19.640
If people are still, I was an all-star,

18:19.640 --> 18:21.640
or a five-star man,

18:21.640 --> 18:24.640
but I'm sure that the Trapper Keeper is still hot.

18:24.640 --> 18:28.640
You could also apply those stickers to a sleeping friend.

18:28.640 --> 18:29.640
Mm-hmm.

18:29.640 --> 18:31.640
We recorded our special episode yesterday,

18:31.640 --> 18:34.640
our Plus Drive episode, your bonus episode yesterday,

18:34.640 --> 18:35.640
and it is...

18:35.640 --> 18:36.640
Probably the best.

18:36.640 --> 18:37.640
It's a barn burner.

18:37.640 --> 18:39.640
And I would say star-studded.

18:39.640 --> 18:41.640
Yeah, we got some, can we tell them about the stars?

18:41.640 --> 18:42.640
Yeah, please.

18:42.640 --> 18:43.640
Yeah.

18:43.640 --> 18:45.640
Oh, we've got, you want Jordan,

18:45.640 --> 18:48.640
you want Jesse Thorne from Jordan and Jesse Go?

18:48.640 --> 18:49.640
You got him.

18:49.640 --> 18:52.640
Dave Shimka and Graham Clark from Stop Podcasting Yourself?

18:52.640 --> 18:53.640
Yeah, sure, why not?

18:53.640 --> 18:54.640
You want Clint McElroy?

18:54.640 --> 18:55.640
Just toss him in there.

18:55.640 --> 18:56.640
You want Clint McElroy?

18:56.640 --> 18:57.640
Who?

18:57.640 --> 18:58.640
That's right.

18:58.640 --> 18:59.640
Clint McElroy.

18:59.640 --> 19:00.640
McElroy Scion.

19:00.640 --> 19:01.640
You want Clint McElroy?

19:01.640 --> 19:02.640
No problem.

19:02.640 --> 19:05.640
How about John Hodgman?

19:05.640 --> 19:07.640
Yeah, I think you might want to go get that app.

19:07.640 --> 19:11.640
And you can only get it by donating to Maximum Fund Drive

19:11.640 --> 19:13.640
as little as $2 a month.

19:13.640 --> 19:14.640
I know you can afford that.

19:14.640 --> 19:15.640
But if you want to bump it up,

19:15.640 --> 19:17.640
let's say you want to get up to $10,

19:17.640 --> 19:19.640
you say I can afford $10 a month for things I like.

19:19.640 --> 19:21.640
If they want to go to $10?

19:21.640 --> 19:23.640
Yeah, $10 you get a tote bag.

19:23.640 --> 19:25.640
You're gonna get a tote bag.

19:25.640 --> 19:28.640
We would, you can get it for any Maximum Fund show.

19:28.640 --> 19:31.640
There's only one right answer, of course.

19:31.640 --> 19:32.640
We all have our own designs.

19:32.640 --> 19:34.640
Ours was done by Mr. Justin Russo

19:34.640 --> 19:36.640
whose work you're probably familiar with

19:36.640 --> 19:41.640
because it's pretty much the best work on the planet.

19:41.640 --> 19:44.640
Have you guys seen the Constitution of the United States?

19:44.640 --> 19:45.640
He's like Da Vinci's Da Vinci.

19:45.640 --> 19:47.640
Yeah.

19:47.640 --> 19:49.640
He did the layout for the Constitution,

19:49.640 --> 19:50.640
is what I'm saying.

19:50.640 --> 19:51.640
Yeah.

19:51.640 --> 19:53.640
And those tote bags come from the fine people.

19:53.640 --> 19:56.640
Those tote bags are from the fine people at EcoBags.

19:56.640 --> 19:57.640
Thank you so much.

19:57.640 --> 19:58.640
Fine people at EcoBags.

19:58.640 --> 19:59.640
Who did the printing on those?

19:59.640 --> 20:01.640
I believe it was VG Kids.

20:01.640 --> 20:03.640
I've seen their work before.

20:03.640 --> 20:06.640
It's equally exquisite.

20:06.640 --> 20:08.640
So that would be awesome.

20:08.640 --> 20:09.640
If you want to get that tote bag,

20:09.640 --> 20:11.640
and make sure you do request My Brother My Brother Mute tote bag,

20:11.640 --> 20:12.640
it's the best one.

20:12.640 --> 20:15.640
It makes the other ones look like a dookie bag.

20:15.640 --> 20:17.640
That's all I'm saying.

20:17.640 --> 20:18.640
That's all I'm saying.

20:18.640 --> 20:19.640
I don't want to judge them.

20:19.640 --> 20:21.640
You get the Max Fund pack

20:21.640 --> 20:24.640
and the Donors Only episodes with the $10 a month.

20:24.640 --> 20:25.640
Go ahead.

20:25.640 --> 20:27.640
Each of these levels, you get the shit in the last level,

20:27.640 --> 20:28.640
the previous levels as well.

20:28.640 --> 20:29.640
Yeah.

20:29.640 --> 20:30.640
It's just the values.

20:30.640 --> 20:34.640
The value is out of this world.

20:34.640 --> 20:37.640
And then at $20 a month, if you go to $20,

20:37.640 --> 20:39.640
you're going to be a part of the Diamond Friendship Circle.

20:39.640 --> 20:40.640
I'm going to tell you.

20:40.640 --> 20:41.640
$10, you're a friend of the family.

20:41.640 --> 20:43.640
$20, Diamond Friendship Circle.

20:43.640 --> 20:45.640
My knee is bleeding.

20:45.640 --> 20:48.640
I don't know why I mentioned that, but it is happening.

20:48.640 --> 20:53.640
Is it because of all the special feelings you're feeling right now?

20:53.640 --> 20:56.640
I feel so emotional that my knee is bleeding.

20:56.640 --> 20:57.640
That's love.

20:57.640 --> 20:59.640
That's love coming out of your knee.

20:59.640 --> 21:01.640
You're going to get a special Max Fund USB drive.

21:01.640 --> 21:02.640
So cool.

21:02.640 --> 21:04.640
It's made of wood.

21:04.640 --> 21:09.640
How does it keep all the technology inside?

21:09.640 --> 21:10.640
Dryads.

21:10.640 --> 21:17.640
It's a special USB drive made of wood emblazoned with the Rocket to the Stars Max Fund logo.

21:17.640 --> 21:18.640
It's full of Max Fund shows.

21:18.640 --> 21:20.640
You delete them, I don't care.

21:20.640 --> 21:21.640
Wholesale.

21:21.640 --> 21:22.640
I don't care.

21:22.640 --> 21:23.640
Screw you.

21:23.640 --> 21:24.640
Put porn on it.

21:24.640 --> 21:25.640
Do what you like.

21:25.640 --> 21:26.640
Tote bag, got it.

21:26.640 --> 21:27.640
Max Fund pack, you know it.

21:27.640 --> 21:28.640
Dryads.

21:28.640 --> 21:29.640
You put porn in the tote bag.

21:29.640 --> 21:34.640
Exclusive access to donor-only episodes of podcasts and three-year short films.

21:34.640 --> 21:35.640
Yeah, I should say so.

21:35.640 --> 21:36.640
Uh-huh.

21:36.640 --> 21:39.640
We'll tell you about some of the other donation levels here in a bit.

21:39.640 --> 21:43.640
But we really, really could use your help here.

21:43.640 --> 21:49.640
If you want to go to maximumfund.org forward slash donate, you'll see all the different

21:49.640 --> 21:52.640
levels right there.

21:52.640 --> 21:56.640
If you don't have the internet, how the fuck are you listening to this, you wizard?

21:56.640 --> 21:57.640
You silly bitch.

21:57.640 --> 21:59.640
You silly bitch wizard.

21:59.640 --> 22:05.640
I just want to say this really is a really cool way for you guys to invest in the show.

22:05.640 --> 22:10.640
You guys have been nothing but warm and receptive to us since we started.

22:10.640 --> 22:11.640
And this thing just keeps growing.

22:11.640 --> 22:13.640
And we want it to keep growing.

22:13.640 --> 22:19.640
And we could use whatever help you could give us because, yeah, just get involved.

22:19.640 --> 22:22.640
You're going to feel so good if you donate.

22:22.640 --> 22:25.640
And every time you listen to the show or any of the other fine shows on the Max Fund

22:25.640 --> 22:30.640
Network, and you'll know that it's because of you that we can keep doing this awesome

22:30.640 --> 22:32.640
thing that we absolutely love doing.

22:32.640 --> 22:35.640
Think about it like buying stock in My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

22:35.640 --> 22:36.640
Yeah.

22:36.640 --> 22:39.640
And pretty soon you'll be part owner of My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

22:39.640 --> 22:40.640
Minority stake.

22:40.640 --> 22:43.640
We're the Green Bay Packers of podcasts.

22:43.640 --> 22:44.640
Okay.

22:44.640 --> 22:45.640
I like it.

22:45.640 --> 22:47.640
And we're Super Bowl champs.

22:47.640 --> 22:48.640
Mm-hmm.

22:48.640 --> 22:49.640
Mm-hmm.

22:49.640 --> 22:53.640
I'm the Clay Matthews of audio broadcasting.

22:53.640 --> 22:54.640
I'm the Vince.

22:54.640 --> 22:55.640
And I'm the other one.

22:55.640 --> 23:02.640
I'm the Vince Lombardi of taking it downtown for the three-point goal.

23:02.640 --> 23:04.640
So donate right now.

23:04.640 --> 23:05.640
Don't wait.

23:05.640 --> 23:06.640
Don't hesitate.

23:06.640 --> 23:07.640
Go get on your computer.

23:07.640 --> 23:09.640
I know you have the internet.

23:09.640 --> 23:10.640
Stop playing.

23:10.640 --> 23:11.640
Go to MaximumFun.org.

23:11.640 --> 23:14.640
And get on board.

23:14.640 --> 23:15.640
Moving on.

23:15.640 --> 23:19.640
I met this girl at a party on Saturday, and she asked me for my number.

23:19.640 --> 23:21.640
I requested hers in return.

23:21.640 --> 23:25.640
What is the correct number of days I should wait to call and ask for a date as to not

23:25.640 --> 23:27.640
seem too eager or dismissive?

23:27.640 --> 23:28.640
I love this.

23:28.640 --> 23:29.640
She's really pretty.

23:29.640 --> 23:30.640
Wait.

23:30.640 --> 23:32.640
Forget about the name of this one.

23:32.640 --> 23:36.640
Well, I don't believe in that.

23:36.640 --> 23:38.640
I mean, I don't either.

23:38.640 --> 23:40.640
I don't believe in the waiting period.

23:40.640 --> 23:41.640
And I'll tell you why.

23:41.640 --> 23:43.640
First off, you're not in swingers.

23:43.640 --> 23:44.640
Fuck you.

23:44.640 --> 23:45.640
All right.

23:45.640 --> 23:46.640
I'm sorry.

23:46.640 --> 23:48.640
You're no Vince Vaughn.

23:48.640 --> 23:50.640
You're barely a Jean Favreau.

23:50.640 --> 23:55.640
And even if you are Jean Favreau, you're Jean Favreau and Rudy carrying an extra 50 pounds

23:55.640 --> 23:56.640
or so.

23:56.640 --> 23:57.640
Whoa.

23:57.640 --> 24:01.640
If you like somebody, had a good time, you're going to wake up the next day thinking about

24:01.640 --> 24:02.640
that person.

24:02.640 --> 24:03.640
Guaranteed.

24:03.640 --> 24:06.640
And they're going to wake up the next day maybe thinking about you.

24:06.640 --> 24:07.640
Maybe they're not.

24:07.640 --> 24:08.640
Like, you've got to guarantee.

24:08.640 --> 24:09.640
You've got to close.

24:09.640 --> 24:10.640
You've got to ask for the sale.

24:10.640 --> 24:13.640
You've got to get on the horn and make contact.

24:13.640 --> 24:14.640
I say no waiting.

24:14.640 --> 24:15.640
I don't believe in it.

24:15.640 --> 24:16.640
I think that's a great point.

24:16.640 --> 24:22.640
If you call someone and it's quote too early to call them, newsflash, they weren't that

24:22.640 --> 24:23.640
interested.

24:23.640 --> 24:27.640
If you tell me that you're going to wait three days to call a girl that you were really into,

24:27.640 --> 24:31.640
you're going to have to convince me that you are not going to get hit by a bus tomorrow

24:31.640 --> 24:35.640
because if you can't prove that, then pick up the phone and start dialing.

24:35.640 --> 24:36.640
That's all I'm saying.

24:36.640 --> 24:37.640
Live like you were dying.

24:37.640 --> 24:40.640
And anyone that tells you you should wait, you shouldn't listen to their advice.

24:40.640 --> 24:41.640
Like, that's the kind of thing.

24:41.640 --> 24:44.640
Like, it's just the beginning of like a mind game.

24:44.640 --> 24:45.640
Like, you don't want to do that.

24:45.640 --> 24:46.640
It's stupid.

24:46.640 --> 24:51.640
If you think this person is real pretty and you're actually interested in them, why wait?

24:51.640 --> 24:53.640
Like, it doesn't make any sense.

24:53.640 --> 24:56.640
There are no laws to love.

24:56.640 --> 24:58.640
Throw that rule book out.

24:58.640 --> 25:00.640
Well, there are laws.

25:00.640 --> 25:01.640
There are no laws.

25:01.640 --> 25:02.640
Age limits.

25:02.640 --> 25:05.640
There are no laws when it comes to age of love.

25:05.640 --> 25:07.640
You can't put a legal age on love.

25:07.640 --> 25:08.640
That's what I always say.

25:08.640 --> 25:10.640
Oh, you always say that?

25:10.640 --> 25:11.640
You do.

25:11.640 --> 25:12.640
We have.

25:12.640 --> 25:14.640
We already did that as a society, I think.

25:14.640 --> 25:16.640
Put an age on love.

25:16.640 --> 25:19.640
Just love with reckless abandon.

25:19.640 --> 25:20.640
Within reason.

25:20.640 --> 25:21.640
Definitely.

25:21.640 --> 25:22.640
Yeah.

25:22.640 --> 25:23.640
Nope.

25:23.640 --> 25:24.640
You can't put a reason.

25:24.640 --> 25:25.640
Love ain't got no reason.

25:25.640 --> 25:26.640
Well, I don't know.

25:26.640 --> 25:27.640
Love don't cost a thing.

25:27.640 --> 25:30.640
I learned that from an American idol who's Jennifer Lopez.

25:30.640 --> 25:31.640
Don't need money.

25:31.640 --> 25:32.640
Don't need money.

25:32.640 --> 25:33.640
Don't need fame.

25:33.640 --> 25:34.640
Don't need fame.

25:34.640 --> 25:35.640
What about credit?

25:35.640 --> 25:36.640
What about credit?

25:36.640 --> 25:37.640
I'm almost certain.

25:37.640 --> 25:40.640
Where are we at on credit cards?

25:40.640 --> 25:45.640
You can ride this train without any form of credit or debit card.

25:45.640 --> 25:49.640
Incidentally, a credit or debit card is a perfect way to donate to Maximum Fund.

25:49.640 --> 25:53.640
If you just want to go ahead to Maximum Fund.org, forward slash donate right now.

25:53.640 --> 25:55.640
You can just get it.

25:55.640 --> 26:01.640
I want to throw out just in case this wasn't implied, you should wait at least 12 hours.

26:01.640 --> 26:03.640
Before donating?

26:03.640 --> 26:04.640
No, before calling.

26:04.640 --> 26:07.640
If you get her number, do not call her on the way home.

26:07.640 --> 26:09.640
Yeah, that's weird.

26:09.640 --> 26:10.640
Hey, listen.

26:10.640 --> 26:11.640
Excitement is one thing.

26:11.640 --> 26:13.640
Stalker is another.

26:13.640 --> 26:16.640
Let's make this more relevant for the now generation.

26:16.640 --> 26:18.640
You don't tweet them.

26:18.640 --> 26:19.640
Yeah, it's Facebook.

26:19.640 --> 26:23.640
What's the ruling on Facebook sending a Facebook friend request?

26:23.640 --> 26:24.640
Because I always feel weird.

26:24.640 --> 26:25.640
No.

26:25.640 --> 26:27.640
I'll meet somebody and be like, you seem like a cool person I can be friends with.

26:27.640 --> 26:31.640
But if I Facebook them as soon as I get home, I'm going to seem like a fucking weirdo that

26:31.640 --> 26:34.640
was like, I can't wait to put you in my collection.

26:34.640 --> 26:35.640
Here's what you need to be aware.

26:35.640 --> 26:39.640
If she's giving you her number and then you Facebook friend request her, you're taking

26:39.640 --> 26:40.640
a step back.

26:40.640 --> 26:43.640
You've already got the number.

26:43.640 --> 26:44.640
You need to move forward.

26:44.640 --> 26:47.640
Also, you shouldn't text her until you call her first.

26:47.640 --> 26:53.640
And if you do tweet, make sure you remove the location, especially if it is in her bushes.

26:53.640 --> 26:54.640
That's really important.

26:54.640 --> 26:56.640
Where is this coming from?

26:56.640 --> 26:58.640
This tweet is coming from my bushes outside.

26:58.640 --> 27:00.640
This tweet is coming from inside the house.

27:00.640 --> 27:02.640
It's coming from inside the house.

27:02.640 --> 27:03.640
He's tweeting.

27:03.640 --> 27:05.640
Is that a Marcus shaped topiary?

27:05.640 --> 27:06.640
Nope.

27:06.640 --> 27:07.640
Nope.

27:07.640 --> 27:08.640
Marcus is in my bushes.

27:08.640 --> 27:11.640
It's just Big M stalking again.

27:11.640 --> 27:12.640
Lately, I've noticed something.

27:12.640 --> 27:16.640
My girlfriend's unable to keep quiet when we're trying to indulge in any sort of recording

27:16.640 --> 27:17.640
media.

27:17.640 --> 27:23.640
Even when it's something we're both interested in, movies, podcasts, TV shows, etc.

27:23.640 --> 27:26.640
I can count on it being interrupted by a story that lasts forever.

27:26.640 --> 27:30.640
I'm the kind of guy that likes to catch every second of what I'm watching or listening to.

27:30.640 --> 27:36.640
I've given up listening to your show when we're together because I'll hear an explosion of laughter from Travis and have no idea what I just missed.

27:36.640 --> 27:39.640
What's the most what I just missed?

27:39.640 --> 27:40.640
That's what I said.

27:40.640 --> 27:42.640
That's what he typed, I swear.

27:42.640 --> 27:45.640
What's the most polite way to say shut up?

27:45.640 --> 27:47.640
Talked out in Toronto.

27:47.640 --> 27:50.640
Hey, dog, there's not.

27:50.640 --> 27:53.640
You just got to pick and choose your media, my friend.

27:53.640 --> 27:58.640
If you want to end your relationship real quick, the best thing to do is as soon as she starts talking,

27:58.640 --> 28:04.640
pause whatever you're listening to or watching, let go of a deep sigh and turn towards her and go, no, please go on.

28:04.640 --> 28:06.640
Oh, God.

28:06.640 --> 28:07.640
That's brutal.

28:07.640 --> 28:09.640
That is really brutal.

28:09.640 --> 28:10.640
Yeah.

28:10.640 --> 28:13.640
Or you could also get also in that relationship right quick just by saying shut up.

28:13.640 --> 28:14.640
Shut up.

28:14.640 --> 28:15.640
Shut up.

28:15.640 --> 28:16.640
Shut up.

28:16.640 --> 28:17.640
Miet.

28:17.640 --> 28:18.640
Miet.

28:18.640 --> 28:19.640
Miet.

28:19.640 --> 28:20.640
Miet.

28:20.640 --> 28:21.640
Just keep saying that till she stops.

28:21.640 --> 28:23.640
She'll get the message.

28:23.640 --> 28:35.640
I think the best way to deal with this is to, before you indulge in the recorded media, talk her out.

28:35.640 --> 28:37.640
Just let her get it all out.

28:37.640 --> 28:41.640
Let her hear about everything that's been going on in your life, in her life.

28:41.640 --> 28:43.640
So she feels that like sated.

28:43.640 --> 28:46.640
She's obviously got a need to connect with you.

28:46.640 --> 28:53.640
And you know what, there are some shows that you can be sort of understanding about this with.

28:53.640 --> 28:57.640
Like Sydney and I have shows that we watch, that we watch-watch.

28:57.640 --> 29:01.640
But there are other shows that we like to watch just because it kind of starts conversations.

29:01.640 --> 29:06.640
And you can talk, you know, like we don't sit there mum while we watch.

29:06.640 --> 29:07.640
Sister Wives.

29:07.640 --> 29:09.640
Sister Wives or Top Model.

29:09.640 --> 29:10.640
Top Sister Wives?

29:10.640 --> 29:11.640
Top Sister Wives.

29:11.640 --> 29:12.640
I'm the best sister wife there is.

29:12.640 --> 29:13.640
Yeah.

29:13.640 --> 29:15.640
Ezekiel's next top sister wife.

29:15.640 --> 29:21.640
I think we can all agree that Robin is the clear winner this season.

29:21.640 --> 29:22.640
Yeah, she is.

29:22.640 --> 29:24.640
She's a beautiful, homely, strong woman.

29:24.640 --> 29:26.640
I think it's Omarosa.

29:26.640 --> 29:28.640
She's back on TV.

29:28.640 --> 29:29.640
She is on everything.

29:29.640 --> 29:31.640
Man, I love New York.

29:31.640 --> 29:34.640
And she is doing a great job on Ezekiel's next top sister wife.

29:34.640 --> 29:36.640
So let me give you this.

29:36.640 --> 29:37.640
Pick your battles.

29:37.640 --> 29:38.640
I'm going to give you some Zen advice.

29:38.640 --> 29:39.640
Uh oh.

29:39.640 --> 29:40.640
Yeah.

29:40.640 --> 29:46.640
In this modern age of technology, that's what TiVo is for.

29:46.640 --> 29:48.640
It's what pause and stop buttons are for.

29:48.640 --> 29:54.640
And like there is nothing in this world that's so important that you need to tell her to shut up.

29:54.640 --> 29:55.640
You can rewatch something.

29:55.640 --> 29:57.640
You can catch a rerun of it.

29:57.640 --> 29:59.640
You can listen to it again.

29:59.640 --> 30:05.640
Or if it's a podcast, you could delete it and then download it again just several times until you get your fill of it.

30:05.640 --> 30:08.640
Just keep deleting and downloading our podcast.

30:08.640 --> 30:10.640
Because that's good for our numbers.

30:10.640 --> 30:12.640
And it's good for your love life.

30:12.640 --> 30:14.640
Well, it's good for our numbers.

30:14.640 --> 30:17.640
Do you think that she talked during the finale of Lost?

30:17.640 --> 30:19.640
Because fuck that noise.

30:19.640 --> 30:21.640
Oh, then you throw her out a window.

30:21.640 --> 30:23.640
Yeah, it's got to have limits.

30:23.640 --> 30:24.640
Hey, where's Debbie?

30:24.640 --> 30:25.640
Oh, Debbie?

30:25.640 --> 30:26.640
I threw her out a window.

30:26.640 --> 30:29.640
She talked during the finale of Lost and I threw her out a window.

30:29.640 --> 30:33.640
We live on the first floor, but she still went away.

30:33.640 --> 30:35.640
No court will convict you for that crime.

30:35.640 --> 30:36.640
There's not a court in America.

30:36.640 --> 30:37.640
Not a court in the land.

30:37.640 --> 30:40.640
There's not a court in the land that would bust you for that.

30:40.640 --> 30:42.640
Griffin, I need a Yahoo answer.

30:42.640 --> 30:43.640
It's pretty important.

30:43.640 --> 30:44.640
Sure.

30:44.640 --> 30:46.640
Let me see if I can do something for you in that department.

30:46.640 --> 30:47.640
Okay.

30:47.640 --> 30:48.640
This one was sent in by OurGayHeart.

30:48.640 --> 30:50.640
Thank you, OurGayHeart.

30:50.640 --> 30:53.640
It's by Yahoo Answers user Alexis who asks,

30:53.640 --> 30:56.640
What should I call my boyfriend?

30:56.640 --> 31:02.640
My boyfriend and I joke around and call each other by fun pet names like Chump and Punk.

31:02.640 --> 31:08.640
What are some names I could call him, or what have you called boyfriends or girlfriends?

31:08.640 --> 31:13.640
I usually call my girlfriends Chump or Punk, so I'm fresh out of solutions.

31:13.640 --> 31:16.640
You could combine it and just call him Chunk.

31:16.640 --> 31:19.640
Yeah, or Pump.

31:19.640 --> 31:20.640
Sydney and Chunkpump.

31:20.640 --> 31:22.640
Sydney is an encomadont.

31:22.640 --> 31:24.640
Is that normal?

31:24.640 --> 31:26.640
Is that okay?

31:26.640 --> 31:30.640
This is my girlfriend Chunkpump.

31:30.640 --> 31:31.640
I love her very much.

31:31.640 --> 31:33.640
She's very sweet.

31:33.640 --> 31:34.640
This is my girlfriend The Captain.

31:34.640 --> 31:36.640
I really love her very much.

31:36.640 --> 31:38.640
She's a real sweetheart.

31:38.640 --> 31:44.640
Chunkpump makes me think of the old-timey way that pioneers used to get creamed corn up out of the ground.

31:44.640 --> 31:48.640
Got a deep vein here.

31:48.640 --> 31:49.640
This is a nice vein.

31:49.640 --> 31:50.640
It's rich.

31:50.640 --> 31:53.640
Let me get out my creamed corn dowsing machine.

31:53.640 --> 31:57.640
It's made of creamed corn.

31:57.640 --> 32:03.640
I hold a scoop of creamed corn in my left hand and it leads me home.

32:03.640 --> 32:05.640
More creamed corn.

32:05.640 --> 32:12.640
I think we can find some elucidation in the answers that have been provided.

32:12.640 --> 32:13.640
Okay.

32:13.640 --> 32:14.640
That's good.

32:14.640 --> 32:28.640
I have answers user PB responded, names I've called him sap, sweet boy, his middle name Dumbo, loser or just L.

32:28.640 --> 32:30.640
Is his middle name Dumbo?

32:30.640 --> 32:35.640
Reginald Dumbo Bevans.

32:35.640 --> 32:37.640
Killer.

32:37.640 --> 32:42.640
Cop boy or his occupation hyphen boy.

32:42.640 --> 32:44.640

And my favorite.

33:25.640 --> 33:26.640

33:26.640 --> 33:27.640
I'm pretty sure that your boyfriend likes you more than you like him.

33:27.640 --> 33:28.640

33:42.640 --> 33:43.640
Answer.

33:43.640 --> 33:44.640
You call your, you basically call your boyfriend.

33:44.640 --> 33:47.800
I'm just, there are so many in the answers I'm not gonna say who gave them.

33:47.800 --> 33:48.800
The worst.

33:48.800 --> 33:50.320
Just the worst things you can come up with.

33:50.320 --> 33:51.320
Punk chunk.

33:51.320 --> 33:52.320
Punkin' chunkin'.

33:52.320 --> 33:53.880
And he seems really into you.

33:53.880 --> 33:57.280
Except for blonde dumbo, that seems a little out of line.

33:57.280 --> 33:58.600
Well yeah, it's a little mean.

33:58.600 --> 34:00.840
Anastasia responded.

34:00.840 --> 34:01.840

34:11.840 --> 34:12.840

34:12.840 --> 34:19.840
The next thing is the best thing I've ever read.

34:19.840 --> 34:20.840
Badoodly kitten.

34:20.840 --> 34:21.840
What?

34:21.840 --> 34:22.840
Badoodly kitten?

34:22.840 --> 34:23.840
Say that one more time.

34:23.840 --> 34:24.840
Badoodly kitten.

34:24.840 --> 34:25.840
Can I get one more?

34:25.840 --> 34:26.840
Just take me to the bridge?

34:26.840 --> 34:27.840
A Badoodly kitten.

34:27.840 --> 34:28.840
That would be B apostrophe D oodly kitten.

34:28.840 --> 34:43.360
I didn't know that we could just like say sounds and like mash them together.

34:43.360 --> 34:46.140
Like bequonja.

34:46.140 --> 34:48.080
Like bequonja?

34:48.080 --> 34:49.080
Like that's...

34:49.080 --> 34:50.080
Badoodly kitten.

34:50.080 --> 34:51.080
Badoodly kitten.

34:51.080 --> 34:52.080
Kissy kissy sweetheart.

34:52.080 --> 34:56.600
Love and lovey poo.

34:56.600 --> 34:58.400
Sexy yum yum cupcake.

34:58.400 --> 34:59.400
Badoodly kitten.

34:59.400 --> 35:00.400
Badoodly kitten.

35:00.400 --> 35:01.400
Sweetie kins.

35:01.400 --> 35:07.000
These are starting to sound like the names of like really bad Japanese anime.

35:07.000 --> 35:08.720
Sweetie yum yum cakes.

35:08.720 --> 35:11.440
It was sexy yum yum cupcake, which...

35:11.440 --> 35:12.440
Excuse me.

35:12.440 --> 35:13.440
Probably sounds...

35:13.440 --> 35:14.440
Excuse me.

35:14.440 --> 35:15.440
Pardon me.

35:15.440 --> 35:16.440
Yeah.

35:16.440 --> 35:17.440
That's it.

35:17.440 --> 35:18.440
Badoodly...

35:18.440 --> 35:19.440
Sweetie pie cutie cake was your last girlfriend.

35:19.440 --> 35:20.440
I know.

35:20.440 --> 35:21.440
I know what you've been doing behind my back.

35:21.440 --> 35:23.160
Don't you confuse me with her.

35:23.160 --> 35:26.160
I'm not your Badoodly cake anymore.

35:26.160 --> 35:31.400
I don't think I've ever been in any relationship where I had nor distributed pet names.

35:31.400 --> 35:32.400
Really?

35:32.400 --> 35:35.720
I don't think you should have more than like two.

35:35.720 --> 35:40.600
Then it just becomes like a game and kind of stupid.

35:40.600 --> 35:41.600
A little stupid.

35:41.600 --> 35:44.840
Justin, you sounded surprised by my assertion.

35:44.840 --> 35:47.360
Do you and your wife have...

35:47.360 --> 35:50.160
Well I think employing pet names is fine.

35:50.160 --> 35:55.040
I think assigning them is probably a little much.

35:55.040 --> 35:59.240
Because I'm sitting here having a memento sort of flashback moment, I'm realizing that

35:59.240 --> 36:03.400
my wife has, to my knowledge, never employed a pet name when speaking of me.

36:03.400 --> 36:06.760
So maybe I'm off base or maybe this is a one-sided type thing.

36:06.760 --> 36:07.760
But you have one for her?

36:07.760 --> 36:10.640
Are you going to keep it secret like a power word?

36:10.640 --> 36:15.360
I don't have like a specific pet name for her.

36:15.360 --> 36:16.360
Okay.

36:16.360 --> 36:17.360
You yell down the stairs at her.

36:17.360 --> 36:18.360
What?

36:18.360 --> 36:19.360
I don't know.

36:19.360 --> 36:21.800
Just Honey or Sweetie.

36:21.800 --> 36:23.800
You know different malleable nouns?

36:23.800 --> 36:25.000
Like I'll just swap one of those in.

36:25.000 --> 36:26.120
It doesn't really matter.

36:26.120 --> 36:29.400
Here's an action item for this week.

36:29.400 --> 36:35.240
I want you to only refer to your wife by one of the names I've mentioned in this line

36:35.240 --> 36:36.600
of questioning.

36:36.600 --> 36:38.960
May I recommend Badoodly Kitten?

36:38.960 --> 36:41.220
Perhaps Badoodly Kitten.

36:41.220 --> 36:44.320
Maybe Kissy Kissy Sweetheart.

36:44.320 --> 36:45.320
I think it's going to work out really well.

36:45.320 --> 36:46.320
Sexy Yum Yum Cupcake.

36:46.320 --> 36:50.160
That was my last girlfriend.

36:50.160 --> 36:53.680
So you know we've been having a lot of fun here.

36:53.680 --> 36:57.120
And I know that when I am having a lot of fun, what I always think is, I wish I could

36:57.120 --> 36:59.680
pay for this.

36:59.680 --> 37:02.120
The good news is, you can.

37:02.120 --> 37:04.720
This is Pledge Week for maximum fun.

37:04.720 --> 37:12.720
And we are, we wanted to go over some of the other donation levels, but I wanted to thank

37:12.720 --> 37:14.800
you in advance.

37:14.800 --> 37:18.100
And just record, if you haven't donated yet, just go ahead and skip this and then come

37:18.100 --> 37:19.200
on back.

37:19.200 --> 37:21.520
But thank you in advance for donating.

37:21.520 --> 37:22.520
Because it's not just for us.

37:22.520 --> 37:24.400
We're part of a family here.

37:24.400 --> 37:27.520
And we use this money for a lot of really cool stuff.

37:27.520 --> 37:32.960
We're going to use it for, you know, goes to meetups is something that your money goes

37:32.960 --> 37:33.960
towards.

37:33.960 --> 37:38.780
Helping us get together with you guys.

37:38.780 --> 37:45.300
It goes, like we've said before, to hosting fees, to pay artists who help create stuff

37:45.300 --> 37:46.300
with us.

37:46.300 --> 37:47.300
Things like merchandise.

37:47.300 --> 37:48.300
Merchandise, yeah.

37:48.300 --> 37:54.200
I mean, it's a really positive way to spend your money.

37:54.200 --> 37:59.800
Because what maximum fun puts into the world is goodness.

37:59.800 --> 38:02.520
It's unadulterated joy.

38:02.520 --> 38:03.580
Just pleasure.

38:03.580 --> 38:06.520
You're donating to the creation of pleasure.

38:06.520 --> 38:10.620
And if there's a finer way to spend your money, I haven't heard about it.

38:10.620 --> 38:17.280
And if there's a finer level for you to donate at than $35 per month.

38:17.280 --> 38:19.200
There are many higher levels.

38:19.200 --> 38:20.200
These rewards.

38:20.200 --> 38:21.200
I mean, there are.

38:21.200 --> 38:22.200
But there are.

38:22.200 --> 38:25.840
But the rewards for $35 per month is Griffin.

38:25.840 --> 38:26.840
Hit me with it.

38:26.840 --> 38:27.840
It's almost it's on.

38:27.840 --> 38:29.800
I feel like I'm in some sort of dream state.

38:29.800 --> 38:35.200
I've been in a dream state since I first saw it because it's too incredible to be real.

38:35.200 --> 38:41.200
Judge John Hodgman's post apocalyptic justice squad friend of the show.

38:41.200 --> 38:42.200
John Hodgman.

38:42.200 --> 38:43.200
I feel like I need to make that sound.

38:43.200 --> 38:44.200
Yeah.

38:44.200 --> 38:45.200
Can you make it one more time?

38:45.200 --> 38:47.400
Can you step down a little bit?

38:47.400 --> 38:48.400
Awesome.

38:48.400 --> 38:49.400
So what do you get?

38:49.400 --> 38:55.840
You get Judge John Hodgman's and Maximal Fund's completely collectible, completely proprietary

38:55.840 --> 38:58.920
nerd emergency kit.

38:58.920 --> 39:00.320
What's in an emergency kit?

39:00.320 --> 39:04.200
That felt good to say.

39:04.200 --> 39:08.760
I would say the centerpiece, the cornucopia in the middle of your Thanksgiving dinner

39:08.760 --> 39:20.000
table is an Eton self-powered AM FM weather radio with flashlight, a solar USB power station

39:20.000 --> 39:22.600
for your phone.

39:22.600 --> 39:23.600
And that's it.

39:23.600 --> 39:27.080
I kept adding on to that sentence like there was something else on it.

39:27.080 --> 39:28.280
How much more shit do you need?

39:28.280 --> 39:31.080
It's a radio that gets AM FM and weather band.

39:31.080 --> 39:37.240
It charges both solarly and with a crank and has a flashlight on it and a USB power station

39:37.240 --> 39:38.300
for your phone.

39:38.300 --> 39:45.680
If your shit, if Earth's shit gets fucked, like in 2012, if we experience a 2012 scenario,

39:45.680 --> 39:49.120
everyone who doesn't donate $35 per month is going to die on Earth.

39:49.120 --> 39:52.560
I'm sorry, $10 and $20 and $2 and $5, like you guys are great.

39:52.560 --> 39:53.560
Good job.

39:53.560 --> 39:54.560
Thanks for all that.

39:54.560 --> 39:55.560
But you're fucking dead.

39:55.560 --> 39:56.560
You're fucking dead.

39:56.560 --> 39:57.560
You're in heaven.

39:57.560 --> 39:58.560
You're dead.

39:58.560 --> 40:01.400
You didn't go to heaven though, unless the people who paid nothing went to hell.

40:01.400 --> 40:02.400
That's just religion 101.

40:02.400 --> 40:05.400
$2, $5, $10, $20, heaven.

40:05.400 --> 40:06.400
$35.

40:06.400 --> 40:10.200
So don't even fret about heaven or hell yet because you've got a long, long time left

40:10.200 --> 40:14.080
to live because you have this sweet ass emergency kit that will keep you alive forever.

40:14.080 --> 40:15.800
Until the vegetables die out.

40:15.800 --> 40:18.760
Then it's like every man for himself.

40:18.760 --> 40:23.320
Another awesome thing about that radio is it comes with the Red Cross logo emblazoned

40:23.320 --> 40:29.720
across it because every portion of what you donate goes to help the Red Cross in, you

40:29.720 --> 40:30.720
know, those-

40:30.720 --> 40:31.720
You're donating-

40:31.720 --> 40:32.720
Catastrophied countries.

40:32.720 --> 40:35.700
To joy, both here and abroad.

40:35.700 --> 40:40.440
The Maximum Fun USB drive is also in there.

40:40.440 --> 40:47.100
You're going to get a really cool book called Role Models by Mr. John Waters.

40:47.100 --> 40:52.640
He was very, very kind to let us include this book in the nerd emergency kit.

40:52.640 --> 40:53.640
Okay.

40:53.640 --> 40:54.640
We're not even done yet.

40:54.640 --> 40:55.640
We're not even done yet.

40:55.640 --> 40:56.640
This is the craziest thing.

40:56.640 --> 40:57.640
You ready?

40:57.640 --> 40:58.640
There's so much more shit.

40:58.640 --> 40:59.640
This is what I'm really excited about.

40:59.640 --> 41:00.640
Oh.

41:00.640 --> 41:03.480
There's a credit card survival tool that's a can opener, knife edge, screwdriver ruler,

41:03.480 --> 41:10.080
tap opener, four position wrench, butterfly wrench, saw blade, direction ancillary indication,

41:10.080 --> 41:11.760
and a lanyard hole.

41:11.760 --> 41:13.400
You get a saw blade?

41:13.400 --> 41:15.720
A saw blade and a saw blade.

41:15.720 --> 41:16.720
Yeah.

41:16.720 --> 41:18.200
Both of those things are in it.

41:18.200 --> 41:19.200
Pad of graph paper?

41:19.200 --> 41:20.200
Sure.

41:20.200 --> 41:21.200
A mechanical pencil?

41:21.200 --> 41:22.200
Why wouldn't you?

41:22.200 --> 41:23.200
White surgical tape?

41:23.200 --> 41:24.200
Don't mind if I do.

41:24.200 --> 41:25.200
Wait, what would that be for?

41:25.200 --> 41:26.200
20-sided die?

41:26.200 --> 41:27.200
What?

41:27.200 --> 41:28.200
What's the white surgical tape?

41:28.200 --> 41:29.200
For taping up your glasses.

41:29.200 --> 41:30.200
This is the best kit ever.

41:30.200 --> 41:31.200
A 20-sided die?

41:31.200 --> 41:32.200
Sure.

41:32.200 --> 41:33.200
Let's have some fun.

41:33.200 --> 41:36.840
A 20-sided die only rolls 20s.

41:36.840 --> 41:39.240
Nothing but critical hits for you and your friends.

41:39.240 --> 41:45.520
Dinosaur band-aids, astronaut ice cream, powdered tang, and you're going to get the eco bags,

41:45.520 --> 41:51.600
tote bag, and the access to all the shows.

41:51.600 --> 41:52.600
And the stickers in the membership card.

41:52.600 --> 41:53.840
And the stickers in the membership.

41:53.840 --> 41:55.280
Holy shit, guys.

41:55.280 --> 41:56.720
$35 a month.

41:56.720 --> 42:02.600
I feel like you should include extra money in there just for how great that is.

42:02.600 --> 42:09.440
This year alone, I have bought, piecemeal, an Eton self-powered AM-FM weatherband radio

42:09.440 --> 42:16.680
with all that chargey shit, and a USB drive, and that book, and that tool, and some paper,

42:16.680 --> 42:20.760
and a mechanical pencil, and white surgical tape, and a 20-sided die, and dinosaur band-aids,

42:20.760 --> 42:22.240
and astronaut ice cream, and powdered tang.

42:22.240 --> 42:24.920
You know how much it cost me altogether?

42:24.920 --> 42:25.920
How much?

42:25.920 --> 42:26.920
$400,000.

42:26.920 --> 42:32.320
Griffin is so deeply in debt, and there's only one way to get him out, and that's to

42:32.320 --> 42:36.440
go to MaximumFund.org forward slash donate.

42:36.440 --> 42:39.600
You can't argue the value of this fucking near-emergency kit.

42:39.600 --> 42:42.640
It will blow your face off with value.

42:42.640 --> 42:47.240
And pledge right now, do not hesitate, because we need it now.

42:47.240 --> 42:48.240
Griffin's so broke.

42:48.240 --> 42:49.240
I am so, so, so broke.

42:49.240 --> 42:50.240
They're coming.

42:50.240 --> 42:51.240
They're coming for him.

42:51.240 --> 42:54.280
Why did he buy so many astronaut ice creams?

42:54.280 --> 42:55.280
That's the question.

42:55.280 --> 43:01.480
Also, this is worth mentioning, for the first year, Maximum Fund has switched its donation

43:01.480 --> 43:07.480
method off PayPal, because PayPal had it snoot so deep in the tiller.

43:07.480 --> 43:12.480
PayPal was cutting a lot, a significant amount of money out of your donations.

43:12.480 --> 43:13.480
Not no mo.

43:13.480 --> 43:19.880
We have a new donation system, so I think it's basically 99.99% of all the money you

43:19.880 --> 43:25.200
donate goes to Maximum Fund, and goes to supporting great shows like us, and Jordan and Jesse

43:25.200 --> 43:31.860
Goh, and Judge John Hodgman, and Stop Podcasting Yourself, and Sound of Young America.

43:31.860 --> 43:37.800
We need your help to stay alive, because you guys are the only source of revenue that the

43:37.800 --> 43:38.800
Maximum Fund network has.

43:38.800 --> 43:39.800
So please help.

43:39.800 --> 43:40.800
Well, that's not true.

43:40.800 --> 43:43.800
Well, you're pretty much, you're 99.99%.

43:43.800 --> 43:46.920
Again with these numbers that I think you're just making up.

43:46.920 --> 43:55.120
Also, there are challenge donors, which are people who have donated, who have agreed to

43:55.120 --> 44:00.920
donate a certain amount of money for every new donor that Maximum Fund gets.

44:00.920 --> 44:04.240
So your donation is basically a double donation.

44:04.240 --> 44:12.620
The final tally for challenge donations is $5.66 and a half cents.

44:12.620 --> 44:19.160
I'm going to meet that guy who donated 1.5 cents, and I'm going to high-five him someday.

44:19.160 --> 44:20.660
He's the coolest guy ever.

44:20.660 --> 44:26.160
So for every donation, your donation also nets Maximum Fund an additional $5.66 and

44:26.160 --> 44:28.080
a half cents.

44:28.080 --> 44:31.280
So there's double incentive for you to give.

44:31.280 --> 44:34.560
So go donate, because you're going to feel so great, and we're going to feel so great,

44:34.560 --> 44:39.320
because we can keep growing, and keep expanding, and keep this show floating.

44:39.320 --> 44:40.320
Making you laugh.

44:40.320 --> 44:41.320
Keep bringing you joy.

44:41.320 --> 44:42.560
Pleasure, I would say.

44:42.560 --> 44:43.840
We want to please you.

44:43.840 --> 44:47.160
We want to touch your deepest pleasure centers.

44:47.160 --> 44:57.840
Listen, guys, I have trouble waking up in the morning, but especially on weekends.

44:57.840 --> 45:01.400
Recently I woke up at nine, which is when my alarm was set, and went back to sleep.

45:01.400 --> 45:04.840
I woke up later at three in the afternoon, meaning a good portion of my day was already

45:04.840 --> 45:05.840
gone.

45:05.840 --> 45:06.840
Oh, man.

45:06.840 --> 45:07.840
Wow.

45:07.840 --> 45:08.840
That sucks.

45:08.840 --> 45:11.680
I don't really have this problem on weekdays when I have school, but it happens nearly

45:11.680 --> 45:13.600
every Saturday and Sunday.

45:13.600 --> 45:16.440
What can I do to help myself wake up earlier?

45:16.440 --> 45:18.160
I have a suggestion.

45:18.160 --> 45:19.160
What?

45:19.160 --> 45:27.480
Get in a really bad car accident, or fall down a manhole, or almost drown, or get in

45:27.480 --> 45:30.040
a plane that almost crashes.

45:30.040 --> 45:35.080
You got to come face-to-face with your own mortality, Neil, and only then will you realize

45:35.080 --> 45:38.480
how precious every second you spend on this earth is.

45:38.480 --> 45:39.480
Wow.

45:39.480 --> 45:41.520
Griffin, that's beautiful.

45:41.520 --> 45:43.160
Just like the movie Fearless.

45:43.160 --> 45:45.520
If Fearless was a podcast, it would be My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

45:45.520 --> 45:47.120
You have two options.

45:47.120 --> 45:51.120
You come face-to-face with your own mortality, or you buy one of those CD players that will

45:51.120 --> 45:56.960
start playing a certain track at a certain time, and just reach into your bag of Black

45:56.960 --> 46:01.120
Eyed Peas CDs and put in any one that you want, because there is not a track on there

46:01.120 --> 46:03.120
that won't wake you up.

46:03.120 --> 46:05.160
Boom, boom, boom.

46:05.160 --> 46:06.160
You skewed off there.

46:06.160 --> 46:07.160
Boom, boom, boom.

46:07.160 --> 46:08.160
Yeah.

46:08.160 --> 46:09.480
I thought you were really on point, and then that happened.

46:09.480 --> 46:11.840
I keep on copping my swagger.

46:11.840 --> 46:12.840
Oops.

46:12.840 --> 46:13.840
I'm awake.

46:13.840 --> 46:19.120
Neil, I'm worried about you, because waking up at nine, and then falling back to sleep,

46:19.120 --> 46:21.320
and accidentally sleeping for another six hours.

46:21.320 --> 46:22.880
That's a whole sleep.

46:22.880 --> 46:23.880
You sleep twice.

46:23.880 --> 46:25.920
You had a whole nother night's sleep.

46:25.920 --> 46:27.160
What time did you go to bed?

46:27.160 --> 46:31.440
Did you go to sleep at 8.30, and wake up at nine, and then sleep for another six hours?

46:31.440 --> 46:33.400
Hi, I'm Koma Neil.

46:33.400 --> 46:37.440
I don't know if we've met, but I go into Komas sometimes.

46:37.440 --> 46:39.200
Maybe you should just get up and go to school.

46:39.200 --> 46:43.080
I mean, I know it's Saturday, but just go to your school and sit there.

46:43.080 --> 46:44.400
Maybe you'll be up, at least.

46:44.400 --> 46:47.000
I bet you'll meet some interesting people.

46:47.000 --> 46:51.260
You know what I do, because I really like snoozing, but what I do is, as soon as my

46:51.260 --> 46:53.440
alarm goes off, don't even think about it.

46:53.440 --> 46:55.600
Just sit straight up in bed.

46:55.600 --> 46:59.080
If you lay there for a minute, and let the alarm go, and think about it, you're going

46:59.080 --> 47:02.120
to talk yourself into hitting the snooze button or turning off the alarm.

47:02.120 --> 47:05.080
But if you just spring up out of bed, you're up.

47:05.080 --> 47:06.080
You're good.

47:06.080 --> 47:07.080
Just get going.

47:07.080 --> 47:08.080
Don't lay there.

47:08.080 --> 47:12.440
Another good one is to put your alarm clock on the other side of the room.

47:12.440 --> 47:13.440
Don't put it right next to you.

47:13.440 --> 47:14.440
Put it on the other side of the room.

47:14.440 --> 47:15.440
Because then you're up and out of bed.

47:15.440 --> 47:17.480
And once you're out of bed, half the battle is already won.

47:17.480 --> 47:22.880
Maybe Neil's got a tiny Chicago bedroom where it's impossible to put your alarm clock at

47:22.880 --> 47:25.400
a place you can't reach while supine.

47:25.400 --> 47:29.720
Well then, if you have a phone and an alarm clock, set your alarm clock and then set the

47:29.720 --> 47:31.960
alarm on your phone for one minute later.

47:31.960 --> 47:36.440
And then tape them both to the ceiling.

47:36.440 --> 47:39.320
And then put them in your roommate's room.

47:39.320 --> 47:41.240
I still say, Neil, guess what?

47:41.240 --> 47:42.760
You're gonna die.

47:42.760 --> 47:43.760
Hey, Neil?

47:43.760 --> 47:44.760
You're gonna die.

47:44.760 --> 47:51.960
It might be today, it might be tomorrow, it might, no, it's probably today or tomorrow.

47:51.960 --> 47:53.240
It's definitely this weekend.

47:53.240 --> 47:54.400
I'd get out there.

47:54.400 --> 47:56.160
Every second counts.

47:56.160 --> 47:57.960
One hundred twenty seven hours.

47:57.960 --> 48:00.080
Every second counts.

48:00.080 --> 48:04.000
Shatner says start living like you're gonna die because you're gonna.

48:04.000 --> 48:05.000
So think about it.

48:05.000 --> 48:06.000
That's what Shatner says.

48:06.000 --> 48:09.520
That's from Bill Shatner, founder of the Black Eyed Peas.

48:09.520 --> 48:13.760
I got a feeling that tonight you're gonna be dead.

48:13.760 --> 48:15.880
Yeah, I got a feeling you're dying tonight.

48:15.880 --> 48:21.840
Griffin, Yahoo Answers, I need a taste, I need a sliver, I need a slice, I need a chunk.

48:21.840 --> 48:23.400
Okay, I actually, I have something.

48:23.400 --> 48:25.880
It's not a Yahoo Answer.

48:25.880 --> 48:30.160
I'm flipping this, I'm flipping the script right on its ear.

48:30.160 --> 48:36.320
I mean, we're on the topic of death, which is serious and, and, and, you know, it's hard

48:36.320 --> 48:37.320
to deal with.

48:37.320 --> 48:38.320
But sexy.

48:38.320 --> 48:39.320
Serious but sexy.

48:39.320 --> 48:42.600
Kind of sexy, but it's, it's hard to wrap the old noodle around.

48:42.600 --> 48:44.240
Oh yeah.

48:44.240 --> 48:50.760
So this, this topic, I guess is the best thing to call it, was sent in by Uber Anthony.

48:50.760 --> 48:51.960
Thanks Uber Anthony.

48:51.960 --> 48:59.560
It's an eHow article, which I'm sure you all know is the world's leading source of, of

48:59.560 --> 49:00.560
information.

49:00.560 --> 49:09.160
It's, it's by eHow contributor Nancy Hendrickson, who has pinned an article, a helpful article

49:09.160 --> 49:12.440
titled How to Talk to Dead People in Dreams.

49:12.440 --> 49:13.440
Uh-huh.

49:13.440 --> 49:14.440
Okay.

49:14.440 --> 49:21.320
The difficulty of this article is moderately challenging, which is if you're looking for

49:21.320 --> 49:27.080
an easier nighttime activity, maybe go find something else, uh, because this is moderately

49:27.080 --> 49:28.800
challenging.

49:28.800 --> 49:34.400
This is not like a relaxing way, uh, to your stroll through the park talking to dead people.

49:34.400 --> 49:37.200
This is like really getting in there and getting it.

49:37.200 --> 49:41.580
Thanks to the popularity of psychics such as John Edwards and Lisa Williams, more and more

49:41.580 --> 49:44.120
people are interested in communicating with the dead.

49:44.120 --> 49:48.600
You can spend years in training to become as accomplished as professionals, or you can

49:48.600 --> 49:53.800
use your own dreams as a way of communicating with loved ones who are no longer on the earth

49:53.800 --> 49:54.800
plane.

49:54.800 --> 49:55.800
Hmm.

49:55.800 --> 49:58.320
The earth plane, got it.

49:58.320 --> 50:02.360
Prepare your sleep space to begin your quest to communicate with the dead via dreams.

50:02.360 --> 50:04.960
Your bedroom shouldn't be dark and without the possibility of interruption.

50:04.960 --> 50:06.520
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

50:06.520 --> 50:09.920
You mean before I go to sleep, it should be dark and shouldn't be interrupted?

50:09.920 --> 50:10.920
Yeah.

50:10.920 --> 50:11.920
Go on.

50:11.920 --> 50:12.920
I'm listening.

50:12.920 --> 50:13.920
Hey, Tommy, what you doing?

50:13.920 --> 50:14.920
Hey.

50:14.920 --> 50:15.920
Shhh.

50:15.920 --> 50:18.080
Fuck, I'm trying to talk to my peepums.

50:18.080 --> 50:19.080
Please leave me.

50:19.080 --> 50:20.440
Let me pee.

50:20.440 --> 50:25.080
Play relaxing meditation music if it helps you, uh, relax quickly into a dream state.

50:25.080 --> 50:28.920
If you choose to play music, be certain that the music has no dramatic spikes in sound

50:28.920 --> 50:31.960
or intensity, as these may wake you up.

50:31.960 --> 50:34.960
We suggest black-eyed peas.

50:34.960 --> 50:39.760
Play black-eyed peas backwards and you'll fall right asleep.

50:39.760 --> 50:45.240
See, I used to listen to the soundtrack to Carl Sagan's Cosmos, uh, but I can't do it

50:45.240 --> 50:48.520
anymore because once it gets to Mars, it's like, oh shit, like I'm up now.

50:48.520 --> 50:49.520
Oh, got them up.

50:49.520 --> 50:50.520
I'm up.

50:50.520 --> 50:53.800
I was talking to peepums about the great war.

50:53.800 --> 50:56.960
Place a dream journal pin and nightlight next to your bed.

50:56.960 --> 51:00.360
Date the journal entry and create a list of questions or topics you hope to discuss in

51:00.360 --> 51:01.480
your dream.

51:01.480 --> 51:05.800
The purpose of this exercise is simply to set your intent, the intent being clear communication

51:05.800 --> 51:09.760
with a specific person who has passed from the living to the world of spirit.

51:09.760 --> 51:12.240
Oh, God.

51:12.240 --> 51:14.360
Is spirit an acronym for something?

51:14.360 --> 51:19.560
The way you said it made it sound like it's like S dot P dot I dot R dot I dot.

51:19.560 --> 51:26.720
Super pathetic internal REM cycle inside Timothy.

51:26.720 --> 51:27.720
Timothy!

51:27.720 --> 51:30.720
It's inside Timothy.

51:30.720 --> 51:34.000
You have to be inside Timothy for this exercise.

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
I'm a member of spirit.

51:36.000 --> 51:43.040
Maybe you are the world's most prolific crime fighting team slash dead people talker tours.

51:43.040 --> 51:46.200
This is my boss, your peepums.

51:46.200 --> 51:50.600
This part, oh my fuck, you guys, this step is so important.

51:50.600 --> 51:54.740
Say a simple prayer of protection before drifting off to sleep and ask the person with whom

51:54.740 --> 51:57.160
you wish to communicate to appear in your dreams.

51:57.160 --> 51:59.120
Be open to receiving communications in varying ways.

51:59.120 --> 52:02.600
For example, your dream may be filled with a conversation with a dead person or the dream

52:02.600 --> 52:05.800
may be filled with images, colors, or symbols.

52:05.800 --> 52:07.720
I had this dream where I ate a giant sandwich.

52:07.720 --> 52:10.960
What do you think Hitler was trying to tell me?

52:10.960 --> 52:15.400
It was very colorful, the sandwich, and symbolic in a way.

52:15.400 --> 52:19.000
As an example, the dead person may say to you, I can't get through to your mother.

52:19.000 --> 52:20.880
She isn't picking up the phone.

52:20.880 --> 52:24.880
Let me try that again.

52:24.880 --> 52:26.340
Could you try her for me?

52:26.340 --> 52:27.600
Maybe send her a text.

52:27.600 --> 52:28.600
Let me try again.

52:28.600 --> 52:34.920
As an example, the dead person may say to you, I can't get through to your mother.

52:34.920 --> 52:40.040
She isn't picking up the phone.

52:40.040 --> 52:45.360
Obviously there is no spirit phone, you dumb fuck.

52:45.360 --> 52:46.360
You dumb shit.

52:46.360 --> 52:47.360
Hey, dummy.

52:47.360 --> 52:48.360
How far do you think this extends?

52:48.360 --> 52:51.440
But it's the dead person's way of saying that they're coming to you because the other person

52:51.440 --> 52:54.520
isn't open to communicating with the dead.

52:54.520 --> 52:58.760
And rather than say that, they brought up the complicated idea of a phone.

52:58.760 --> 52:59.760
Travis, listen.

52:59.760 --> 53:02.500
There's imagery, there's colors, and there's symbols.

53:02.500 --> 53:04.280
The spirit phone is a symbol.

53:04.280 --> 53:06.680
Your mom-moms don't talk to ghosts.

53:06.680 --> 53:10.200
Tell your mom to stop being such a prudish bitch.

53:10.200 --> 53:12.600
I'm trying to get your noodle.

53:12.600 --> 53:17.160
If I have a dream in which I'm in Pee-wee's Playhouse and all of the talking furniture

53:17.160 --> 53:20.640
sounds like Charles Nelson Riley, what's going on?

53:20.640 --> 53:23.360
Ghost of Charles Nelson Riley.

53:23.360 --> 53:24.360
Is he still alive?

53:24.360 --> 53:25.360
He's in Paul Reuben's house.

53:25.360 --> 53:26.920
He's buried underneath Paul Reuben's house.

53:26.920 --> 53:29.000
Paul Reuben killed Charles Nelson Riley.

53:29.000 --> 53:30.000
Everybody knows that.

53:30.000 --> 53:31.000
Buried him in the cellar.

53:31.000 --> 53:32.000
Yeah.

53:32.000 --> 53:37.720
And now he makes the corpses of Charles Nelson Riley watch him eat dinner.

53:37.720 --> 53:41.440
It's a really weird arrangement they have.

53:41.440 --> 53:42.440
Mystery solved.

53:42.440 --> 53:43.440
Mystery solved.

53:43.440 --> 53:46.640
It would have gotten away if it weren't for us meddling kids.

53:46.640 --> 53:47.640
Guys, listen.

53:47.640 --> 53:50.280
I don't think Paul Reuben's killed Charles Nelson Riley.

53:50.280 --> 53:51.280
He probably didn't.

53:51.280 --> 53:52.280
Not yet.

53:52.280 --> 53:53.280
Not yet.

53:53.280 --> 53:54.280
Is that liable?

53:54.280 --> 53:55.280
No.

53:55.280 --> 53:56.280
I just said he didn't.

53:56.280 --> 53:57.280
It's cool.

53:57.280 --> 53:58.280
Yeah.

53:58.280 --> 54:01.040
It's only if you express doubt in your assertion is it not liable.

54:01.040 --> 54:07.960
So I'm going to say with 100% certainty that Paul Reuben's killed Charles Nelson Riley.

54:07.960 --> 54:08.960
That's definitely true.

54:08.960 --> 54:09.960
I believe it.

54:09.960 --> 54:11.960
And I have facts to back it up.

54:11.960 --> 54:12.960
Listen.

54:12.960 --> 54:15.760
Give yourself the opportunity to develop this new communication vehicle.

54:15.760 --> 54:18.500
As they say, Rome wasn't built in a day.

54:18.500 --> 54:22.260
Like all new things, communicating with the dead in dreams takes practice.

54:22.260 --> 54:23.260
You don't believe it?

54:23.260 --> 54:24.260
Ask Julius Caesar.

54:24.260 --> 54:27.680
How do you get to Carnegie Hall?

54:27.680 --> 54:28.680
Dead people.

54:28.680 --> 54:29.680
Practice.

54:29.680 --> 54:30.680
Practice.

54:30.680 --> 54:31.680
Talk to dead Mozart.

54:31.680 --> 54:32.680
He'll give you tips.

54:32.680 --> 54:33.680
He'll give you pro tips.

54:33.680 --> 54:35.840
I'm going to try this tonight.

54:35.840 --> 54:40.440
I don't know about you guys, but I'm ready to start developing this communication vehicle.

54:40.440 --> 54:47.080
If you, I'm already doing it every night, but it is yet to work out for me.

54:47.080 --> 54:50.560
Who are you chatting up in the dream space?

54:50.560 --> 54:52.760
Oh, Rock Hudson.

54:52.760 --> 54:53.760
Really?

54:53.760 --> 54:54.760
Yeah.

54:54.760 --> 54:56.880
I asked him if he had any other secrets.

54:56.880 --> 54:57.880
You know what I mean?

54:57.880 --> 54:58.880
Mm-hmm.

54:58.880 --> 54:59.880
Yeah.

54:59.880 --> 55:02.200
You know who I talked to is Betty White.

55:02.200 --> 55:05.720
Now, stay with me.

55:05.720 --> 55:08.320
She's actually been a hologram for the past couple years.

55:08.320 --> 55:09.320
Holy shit!

55:09.320 --> 55:10.320
Yeah, I know.

55:10.320 --> 55:11.320
That was good.

55:11.320 --> 55:15.000
Because human beings can't be that sexy.

55:15.000 --> 55:17.040
Here's a fact.

55:17.040 --> 55:19.360
This is a stone fact.

55:19.360 --> 55:23.600
If you search for eHow Moderately Challenging to try to find other tasks that are of the

55:23.600 --> 55:27.600
same difficulty level, here are the top three.

55:27.600 --> 55:33.680
How to become a journalist, how to become a screenplay consultant, and how to overcome

55:33.680 --> 55:35.480
an octopus phobia.

55:35.480 --> 55:38.600
Those are the top three.

55:38.600 --> 55:42.280
But aren't those three things basically the same?

55:42.280 --> 55:48.680
I ran a screenplay about the news story about how I overcame my fear of octopi.

55:48.680 --> 55:50.640
Guys, listen.

55:50.640 --> 55:52.020
I'm a journalist.

55:52.020 --> 55:53.080
That's my job.

55:53.080 --> 55:55.180
I can talk to dead people in dreams.

55:55.180 --> 55:59.120
And I know a shit ton about screenplays and their submission.

55:59.120 --> 56:02.960
I am scared fuckless of cephalopods.

56:02.960 --> 56:04.360
Get him out of here!

56:04.360 --> 56:05.360
Can't overcome it.

56:05.360 --> 56:06.360
You'd think.

56:06.360 --> 56:11.600
You'd think my skill level of Moderately Challenging would enable me to overcome that.

56:11.600 --> 56:17.960
I can't even play with Nerf guns because those suction tips remind me of the cold, slimy

56:17.960 --> 56:21.840
feelers of a cephalopod that just wants to drag me down to the briny deep.

56:21.840 --> 56:22.840
Man, I...

56:22.840 --> 56:23.840
Oh, eHowl.

56:23.840 --> 56:26.680
Maybe, maybe that's a new vein for us to tap.

56:26.680 --> 56:27.680
I don't know.

56:27.680 --> 56:28.680
Maybe.

56:28.680 --> 56:30.520
Well, everybody, keep your eyes out on that.

56:30.520 --> 56:34.480
I have a problem when it comes to girls.

56:34.480 --> 56:37.120
Seems I lose interest after I get a girl to like me.

56:37.120 --> 56:41.520
It's almost as if I'm addicted to the thrill of the chase.

56:41.520 --> 56:44.720
This really sucks because I've missed out on being with some really nice girls.

56:44.720 --> 56:45.720
Any advice?

56:45.720 --> 56:48.400
Storm spring.

56:48.400 --> 56:49.400
You're gay.

56:49.400 --> 56:50.400
No way.

56:50.400 --> 56:51.400
Hold on.

56:51.400 --> 56:52.400
Now, wait.

56:52.400 --> 56:53.400
What if he's gay?

56:53.400 --> 56:57.520
What if he dislikes winning girls over and then he realizes like, I'm not that into it

56:57.520 --> 56:59.560
because I'm a little...

56:59.560 --> 57:00.560
I'm kind of gay.

57:00.560 --> 57:01.560
Maybe.

57:01.560 --> 57:02.560
Is that possible?

57:02.560 --> 57:03.560
I think it's...

57:03.560 --> 57:05.240
I mean, anything's possible in this big blue world.

57:05.240 --> 57:06.800
I'm fucking storyboarding this one, Griffin.

57:06.800 --> 57:09.560
I'm just asking if it's possible.

57:09.560 --> 57:13.000
I think you're waterboarding this one.

57:13.000 --> 57:18.560
I've known guys like you, Chase.

57:18.560 --> 57:19.560
Is that his name?

57:19.560 --> 57:20.560
Yeah.

57:20.560 --> 57:21.560
And that is now.

57:21.560 --> 57:22.560
Yeah.

57:22.560 --> 57:23.560
Chase is actually what he was doing.

57:23.560 --> 57:25.480
He had the thrill of...

57:25.480 --> 57:26.840
But if we can just call him Chase.

57:26.840 --> 57:27.840
Okay.

57:27.840 --> 57:31.080
No, and then he could refer to himself as the thrill of the chase.

57:31.080 --> 57:35.520
Lady, are you really ready to experience the thrill of the chase for the next three

57:35.520 --> 57:37.280
to four days of your life?

57:37.280 --> 57:39.800
We have to have at least one listener named Chase.

57:39.800 --> 57:44.400
And if that's your name, congratulations, we just gave you the best pickup line ever.

57:44.400 --> 57:45.400
Yeah.

57:45.400 --> 57:47.960
I would say that anyone who...

57:47.960 --> 57:51.960
The way you describe this whole situation, granted it's three short sentences, but you

57:51.960 --> 57:56.080
say you missed out on being with some really nice girls and you're just interested in the

57:56.080 --> 57:57.080
thrill of the chase.

57:57.080 --> 57:59.600
It doesn't sound like you're really interested in these girls.

57:59.600 --> 58:03.000
You're interested in their interest in you.

58:03.000 --> 58:08.080
So maybe you need to slow your roll and be a little bit more choosy about the women that

58:08.080 --> 58:11.520
you pursue and not just go for...

58:11.520 --> 58:12.520
Yeah.

58:12.520 --> 58:18.200
I think that maybe you need to take a break from that whole situation.

58:18.200 --> 58:20.240
Maybe you need to take a break from...

58:20.240 --> 58:21.240
Chase listen.

58:21.240 --> 58:22.680
Chase listen.

58:22.680 --> 58:25.320
Come kick it with me in my lady siesta.

58:25.320 --> 58:33.040
Now there's definitely a point at which that sort of falls off.

58:33.040 --> 58:34.960
You think like, okay, I'm not going to do that anymore.

58:34.960 --> 58:35.960
Yeah, sure.

58:35.960 --> 58:43.800
I guess that turns into like a lady coma, a lady shipwrecked, a marooned on an island

58:43.800 --> 58:49.080
by herself with no survival skills and no hatchet with which to fashion...

58:49.080 --> 58:53.280
Man, you guys remember that book Hatchet?

58:53.280 --> 58:57.080
I feel like you're changing the subject, but yes.

58:57.080 --> 59:01.280
Have you guys ever read Hatchet by, what's his name, Paul Rubens?

59:01.280 --> 59:02.280
Rubens.

59:02.280 --> 59:12.840
Hatchet, the story of how I chopped up Charles Nelson Riley, an erotic adventure, a Goosebumps

59:12.840 --> 59:13.840
classic.

59:13.840 --> 59:18.920
He actually used a credit card survival tool to chop up Paul Rubens.

59:18.920 --> 59:19.920
Gary Paulson was his name.

59:19.920 --> 59:20.920
But you know what?

59:20.920 --> 59:24.120
He's a donor, so he's still going to heaven.

59:24.120 --> 59:26.680
So basically Paul Rubens killed Charles Nelson.

59:26.680 --> 59:29.400
Is that the supposition we're working under?

59:29.400 --> 59:30.400
Yep.

59:30.400 --> 59:31.400
It's not a supposition.

59:31.400 --> 59:33.480
It's a 100% stone cold fact.

59:33.480 --> 59:35.080
Oh, because the libel worry.

59:35.080 --> 59:36.080
I gotcha.

59:36.080 --> 59:41.200
Listen, we've had a lot of fun here today.

59:41.200 --> 59:42.680
You always start with that.

59:42.680 --> 59:43.680
What?

59:43.680 --> 59:46.720
I mean, people know how much fun they're having.

59:46.720 --> 59:49.680
I find I don't really enjoy things unless people tell me that I'm enjoying them.

59:49.680 --> 59:51.340
You're having a great time right now.

59:51.340 --> 59:53.720
That's how I learned how to eat kale.

59:53.720 --> 59:56.840
People just told me like, this is delicious, and eventually I bought it because I'm a sucker

59:56.840 --> 59:57.840
that way.

59:57.840 --> 01:00:01.000
Hey, and if you're a sucker, why not give us some of your money?

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:08.240
We've talked to you about the amazing $35 donation level for Maximum Fund.

01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:14.040
You're helping all these great shows, and you're helping us out.

01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:22.980
We haven't really hit home yet, and it's what I really want to hit home this break, is that

01:00:22.980 --> 01:00:27.200
we need you guys for us to look good.

01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:35.680
We need you to donate and tell them that you're a Maximum Fund, you're an NBNB AM listener

01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:39.200
because we want to bring you guys into the fold.

01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:47.840
We want our new overlords, our new family to think that we're a valuable contributing

01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:51.000
member of the team, so we need you.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:52.000
Listen.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:53.000
We're relying on you.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.180
This is our first year on Maximum Fund.

01:00:55.180 --> 01:01:01.320
It's also Judge John Hodgman's first year on Maximum Fund, and he's like wicked famous.

01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:02.920
He was on Battlestar Galactica.

01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:05.640
I don't know if you guys know that.

01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:08.200
He was kind of on Battlestar Galactica, and you know.

01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:09.200
I wasn't.

01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:10.440
I don't know if you guys were.

01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:11.520
I have seen Battlestar Galactica.

01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:13.320
I was, but they cut the scene.

01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:16.040
That's this fucking industry, man.

01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:17.040
I know.

01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:20.920
Anyway, it's both our first years.

01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:24.080
The pressure's kind of high for both of us.

01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:25.200
We need to crush him.

01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:26.480
We want to take him apart.

01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:28.600
He was super nice and gave us a question.

01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:29.600
A real sweetheart.

01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:33.840
He was a real sweetheart and gave us a question for our Donors Only episode, but we want to

01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:34.840
destroy him.

01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:35.840
We want to destroy him.

01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:37.400
Yeah, we want to disembowel him.

01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:39.840
We want to make him tear up.

01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:45.800
Now if you want to make it count, if you want to go deep, you want to say, like, I want

01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:48.600
to crush John Hodgman in an authoritative way.

01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:52.200
Not like in the wimpy way that some of these other people.

01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:53.600
You can get hectic on it.

01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:56.360
We have three other donation levels for $50 a month.

01:01:56.360 --> 01:02:00.040
You're going to be part of the Thorn family Blondie Brigade.

01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:07.800
You OK, Jesse and Theresa Thorn, sweethearts, future parents will bake you a homemade batch

01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:12.600
of their signature blondies and FedEx them to your door.

01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:15.920
What can you imagine how delicious that tastes?

01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:17.900
You know, it tastes like generosity.

01:02:17.900 --> 01:02:21.920
Maybe throw him in the microwave first to get him soft and moist again.

01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:26.520
Or are these I've heard story I've heard tell of the Thorns cooking prowess.

01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:33.880
Do you think they've discovered some sort of ever gooey, some sort of ever gooey, you

01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:35.000
know, formula?

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:41.840
They probably just don't call them ever gooey blondies because it's the worst, the grossest

01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:42.840
thing you could say.

01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:48.880
But you're also going to get the nerd emergency kit, which is amazing, as we've already covered.

01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:52.480
You're going to get a USB drive with all our shows.

01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:57.080
You're going to get the Eton self-powered AM FM weather radio.

01:02:57.080 --> 01:02:58.080
That's probably that nerd emergency kit.

01:02:58.080 --> 01:03:00.240
You're going to get roll models by John Waters.

01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:05.880
You're going to get an eco bags tote bag with my brother, my brother and me.

01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:07.740
Really cool art emblazoned on it.

01:03:07.740 --> 01:03:10.440
It's probably at Maximumfun.org right now if you want to go look at it and we'll tweet

01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:11.560
it and stuff like that.

01:03:11.560 --> 01:03:13.120
But it's a great Justin Rousseau design.

01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:14.220
He really outdid himself.

01:03:14.220 --> 01:03:19.200
It's also worth mentioning that these blondies, they have a half-life of 65 years.

01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:22.360
So they're going to, they're going to go with you into the apocalypse with the nerd emergency

01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:26.560
kit and they'll, they're rich in nutrients and flavors.

01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:33.700
So they'll sustain you for, if you're rich in nutrients and also money, you can be one

01:03:33.700 --> 01:03:36.140
of Jesse's golden eagles for a hundred dollars a month.

01:03:36.140 --> 01:03:39.880
That will net you all the things we've talked about before, plus homemade blondie delivery,

01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:44.720
an emergency kit, Max Fun Drive tote bag, Max Fun Pack with the stickers, exclusive

01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:49.940
access to all these episodes and an invitation to the Max Fun Dinner, which is a special

01:03:49.940 --> 01:03:55.960
dinner the night before Max Fun Con with staff performers and friends of Max Fun Con.

01:03:55.960 --> 01:04:01.640
If you can't make it, Jesse will personally take you to lunch when you're in LA.

01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:02.880
So go to LA, Jesse will take you to lunch.

01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:03.880
It'll be a lot of fun.

01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:05.980
For $200 a month, that's the biggie.

01:04:05.980 --> 01:04:07.320
That's the big guy.

01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:09.280
Jordan's platinum angels.

01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:11.760
Pre-registration at the next Max Fun Con.

01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:18.360
Come to the dinner, going to get the blondies, new emergency kit, USB drive tote bag, Max

01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:21.760
Fun Pack exclusive X episode to all the podcasts.

01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:24.960
I know that not everybody is going to be able to give $200 a month.

01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:27.840
Like I wish I had $200 a month to donate.

01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:28.840
I don't.

01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:34.840
But if you have been with us over this past year, you've enjoyed the show and you're looking

01:04:34.840 --> 01:04:40.560
for a way to support us in what we're doing and support some of the great Max Fun shows.

01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:46.920
I think if you can't do, you know, you can't maybe do $200, maybe you can do $50.

01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:50.920
Maybe you can do $35 and get that amazing nerd emergency kit.

01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:52.080
$20 a month.

01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:54.000
You know, the diamond friendship circle.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:57.720
Just think about what the kind of entertainment you're getting from our show and the other

01:04:57.720 --> 01:05:01.000
shows and what it's been worth to you.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
Justin, may I say something?

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:04.000
No.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:05.000
Okay.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:06.000
People.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:07.000
Oh shit.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:10.280
Shit's about to get real.

01:05:10.280 --> 01:05:11.280
This is going to be real.

01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:14.480
I can't lie.

01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:15.480
I love you.

01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:16.480
Oh man.

01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:17.480
Yeah.

01:05:17.480 --> 01:05:18.480
There it is.

01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:19.480
I said it.

01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:20.480
I love you.

01:05:20.480 --> 01:05:21.480
Are you in love with them?

01:05:21.480 --> 01:05:22.480
I may be.

01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:23.480
I may be.

01:05:23.480 --> 01:05:24.480
They're pretty wonderful people.

01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:29.760
And as I look out upon you people, imaginarily in front of me, I see some beautiful faces

01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:30.760
out there.

01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:35.520
Some average faces, but no ugly faces, so good work.

01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:40.240
And I would like to look each one of you in the eye in my imagination and say, the bills

01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:43.800
come due.

01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:48.200
Some of this money goes to pay the staff of Maximum Fund, which does include your friends

01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:51.080
at My Brother and Me.

01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:59.680
Last night, I put on a suit and I went and ate a steak and I brought a flask of whiskey

01:05:59.680 --> 01:06:03.920
and poured out half of my Diet Coke and filled the rest up with whiskey.

01:06:03.920 --> 01:06:05.400
This sounds like a classy evening.

01:06:05.400 --> 01:06:06.400
What could possibly-

01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:08.560
And went and saw Drive Angry 3D.

01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:10.080
That's what I do with my money.

01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:11.360
You don't want to support that?

01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:12.360
Fuck you.

01:06:12.360 --> 01:06:15.880
Justin, I think you meant to say Drive Angry shot in 3D.

01:06:15.880 --> 01:06:19.680
Drive Angry, shot in 3D.

01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:21.600
That's what we're doing.

01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:24.080
And I need your cash to do that.

01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:25.800
Nicolas Cage doesn't pay himself.

01:06:25.800 --> 01:06:27.360
This is an ecosystem you're supporting here.

01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:28.360
It's not just me.

01:06:28.360 --> 01:06:30.000
It's not just about us.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:31.000
It's about the family.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:34.320
Do you know how much it costs to maintain my collection of baby ducks?

01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:36.320
Why would you-

01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:37.320
Jesus Christ.

01:06:37.320 --> 01:06:40.160
He has to kill them, first of all, when they turn one.

01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:41.160
Well, yeah.

01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:42.160
Thanks.

01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:43.160
That's what I'm saying.

01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:48.240
And then to replenish, like it's a constant stream of baby ducks and baby duck corpses

01:06:48.240 --> 01:06:50.080
out one door.

01:06:50.080 --> 01:06:51.080
It's terrible.

01:06:51.080 --> 01:06:53.600
I'm going to tell you the most exciting part.

01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:59.240
If you flash your Maximum Fun membership card at any of us, that comes in the Maximum Fun

01:06:59.240 --> 01:07:05.840
pack that is at any donation level, you are owed a hug from any of the three of us, all

01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:08.000
three of us, however you want to break it down.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:09.000
We'll give you a hug.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:12.880
If we're all three there, yeah, we can do like a triangle hug if all three of us are

01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:13.880
present.

01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:14.880
Yeah.

01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:15.880
There's no touching.

01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:16.880
We just, we cover you in our energies.

01:07:16.880 --> 01:07:17.880
Yeah.

01:07:17.880 --> 01:07:18.880
Just get our energy.

01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:20.760
Get our chakras up in you.

01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:23.880
But if you flash your card, we will give you a hug.

01:07:23.880 --> 01:07:24.880
The best fucking hug I've ever received.

01:07:24.880 --> 01:07:30.880
Also, you earn the rights, like the massive, massive Twitter bragging rights.

01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:34.680
You get to go on Twitter and lord it over every other My Brother, My Brother and Me

01:07:34.680 --> 01:07:37.480
fan that you have donated and they have not.

01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:38.480
Make sure you do.

01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:43.240
Make sure you flaunt it because we want to know who the real heroes are, the real special

01:07:43.240 --> 01:07:44.240
people.

01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:49.760
And I'm sure we'll be retweeting those as people donate and helping to spread the word

01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:50.920
there.

01:07:50.920 --> 01:07:53.040
And if you know a buddy has it donated, get on them.

01:07:53.040 --> 01:07:54.040
Say hey jerk.

01:07:54.040 --> 01:07:55.040
Hey dummy.

01:07:55.040 --> 01:07:56.040
Jerk wad.

01:07:56.040 --> 01:07:57.040
Hey stupid.

01:07:57.040 --> 01:07:58.040
Hey Chunk Pump.

01:07:58.040 --> 01:07:59.040
Hey Chunk Pump.

01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:00.080
How about putting up some dough?

01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:02.880
Just go to MaximumFun.org right now.

01:08:02.880 --> 01:08:03.880
Don't wait.

01:08:03.880 --> 01:08:04.880
Slash donate.

01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:07.280
Slash donate.

01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:08.280
And pledge.

01:08:08.280 --> 01:08:09.280
Pledge what you can.

01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:13.000
And you have no idea how much we appreciate it.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:14.120
It really means a lot to us.

01:08:14.120 --> 01:08:17.240
And you're going to get some really cool, some really cool gifts.

01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:23.280
I actually asked Jesse if it's okay if I, or if it's weird if I donate because I want

01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:27.840
the, I want the Postalumdian Justice Squad kit.

01:08:27.840 --> 01:08:29.400
And I want to try his blondies.

01:08:29.400 --> 01:08:30.400
What's so weird about that?

01:08:30.400 --> 01:08:31.400
There's nothing weird about it.

01:08:31.400 --> 01:08:32.400
I mean when I said it just now.

01:08:32.400 --> 01:08:38.840
I want a membership card so that I can finally get a hug from my brothers.

01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:41.660
One more thing.

01:08:41.660 --> 01:08:45.640
One of the coolest parts about us joining Maximum Fun, or for me, one of the coolest

01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:51.760
things that happened was when we joined up and a lot of people in the Maximum Fun community

01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:57.000
said this is so awesome because I already listened to this show before I joined the

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:58.000
Maximum Fun.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:02.400
And this is just kind of a reaffirmation that Maximum Fun knows what I like.

01:09:02.400 --> 01:09:04.500
Knows how I do.

01:09:04.500 --> 01:09:09.280
And to those people and the people who are already Maximum Fun donors, like thank you

01:09:09.280 --> 01:09:10.820
a fuck ton.

01:09:10.820 --> 01:09:13.640
Thank you so very, very much.

01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:14.960
Maybe you want to bump it up this year.

01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:19.720
I've seen a few people on the forums talking about kicking it up to Notches Unknown.

01:09:19.720 --> 01:09:23.000
Well I guess the Notches are pretty well established.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:28.280
But if you want to do that, that would be absolutely incredible because our family is

01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:29.280
getting bigger.

01:09:29.280 --> 01:09:30.280
You know?

01:09:30.280 --> 01:09:31.280
We've got more responsibilities.

01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:32.280
Both figuratively.

01:09:32.280 --> 01:09:33.280
Yeah.

01:09:33.280 --> 01:09:34.280
All you've got to do.

01:09:34.280 --> 01:09:35.280
We can wait.

01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:40.440
We won't be funny for the next 30 seconds as you go to Maximum Fun dot org.

01:09:40.440 --> 01:09:41.440
That's the site.

01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:43.200
Maximum Fun dot org.

01:09:43.200 --> 01:09:46.520
You click, you see a button there that says donate.

01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:48.040
Or you can just skip it.

01:09:48.040 --> 01:09:49.040
Skip the rigamarole.

01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:51.680
Go to Maximum Fun dot org forward slash donate.

01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:55.000
And make sure you tell them we sent you.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.640
And seriously, it means so much to us.

01:09:57.640 --> 01:10:05.720
Also if you have an old donation in the PayPal system, go to that page too so you can get

01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:10.340
a new, you know, get on this new system and email Teresa at Maximum Fun dot org and she

01:10:10.340 --> 01:10:11.840
can get rid of your old subscription.

01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:17.040
And email PayPal a picture of you just farting.

01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:18.040
Like farting out of your butthole.

01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:19.600
And say this is you.

01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:20.600
Yeah.

01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:23.480
Have an arrow pointing to your fart and have it say this is you PayPal.

01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:26.640
Because PayPal is a fart.

01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:31.560
You're really turning this from like a pledge show into like an anti-Paypal show, I feel

01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:32.560
like.

01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:33.560
PayPal banned my account.

01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:34.560
And that's true.

01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:36.880
PayPal once banned my account because I bought some Pokemon cards.

01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:37.880
Oh good.

01:10:37.880 --> 01:10:38.880
Oh no, no.

01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:39.880
I'm sorry.

01:10:39.880 --> 01:10:44.000
I sold some Pokemon cards and I didn't pay like the eBay fee or whatever.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:45.000
Because that's some bullshit.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.640
I'm not going to pay eBay to sell my shit.

01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:50.920
And they shut my account right down.

01:10:50.920 --> 01:10:54.160
There's a hologram Blastoise in there.

01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:55.160
I'm just letting you go.

01:10:55.160 --> 01:10:56.160
I'm going to go get it first.

01:10:56.160 --> 01:10:57.160
I had a holofoil Blastoise.

01:10:57.160 --> 01:10:58.160
Yeah.

01:10:58.160 --> 01:10:59.160
A holofoil Blastoise.

01:10:59.160 --> 01:11:00.160
Listen.

01:11:00.160 --> 01:11:01.680
All my Pokemon cards are gone.

01:11:01.680 --> 01:11:04.680
I need a new source of income.

01:11:04.680 --> 01:11:06.500
Please donate.

01:11:06.500 --> 01:11:07.500
Please donate.

01:11:07.500 --> 01:11:10.200
Guys, I live in New England with my super hot wife.

01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:12.560
I was just offered a great job in Southern California.

01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:13.560
So Cal.

01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:15.000
He doesn't say that.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:16.000
I said that.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:19.960
But my wife needs to stay here in New England to finish two more years of law school.

01:11:19.960 --> 01:11:23.680
We think we're going to do the long distance thing until she can join me out West.

01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:27.400
We'll have the means to fly back and forth for school between breaks and vacays.

01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:29.660
So it doesn't seem like it'll be that bad.

01:11:29.660 --> 01:11:32.200
Even so, most people tell us we're making a mistake.

01:11:32.200 --> 01:11:33.200
We're in our late twenties.

01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:34.760
We've been married for about eight months.

01:11:34.760 --> 01:11:36.760
Is this a very terrible idea?

01:11:36.760 --> 01:11:46.480
Is it fucked up that, like, in my mind, there's no such thing as a long distance married relationship?

01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:47.480
That seems like it's just-

01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:48.480
Well, you're just married.

01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:49.480
Yeah.

01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:50.480
You're just, like, married.

01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:51.480
Yeah.

01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:52.480
Yeah.

01:11:52.480 --> 01:11:53.480
I think that this is totally doable.

01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:54.480
I mean, it's totally workable.

01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:55.480
Is it a mistake?

01:11:55.480 --> 01:11:56.480
Like, I don't know.

01:11:56.480 --> 01:11:59.880
I mean, it will probably be a stress on your relationship.

01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:00.880
Yeah.

01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:01.880
It's going to suck.

01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:02.880
It's going to suck.

01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:03.880
Yeah.

01:12:03.880 --> 01:12:06.000
But it doesn't sound like it's really, like, a choice.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.040
He's in law school and you got offered a job.

01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:10.920
It's not like one of you is like, I'm going to go check out what it's like on the other

01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:11.920
coast.

01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:16.280
Like, you're in a situation in life that dictates that you may need to be apart for a little

01:12:16.280 --> 01:12:17.280
while.

01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:20.800
You're eventually going to be back together, so it's not, like, a permanent sucky thing.

01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:22.880
You just got to put up with it for a year or two.

01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:24.960
There is a problem.

01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:27.000
Have you seen the ladies in Southern California?

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:33.780
Have you seen those so Cal honeys, those so Cal shawties?

01:12:33.780 --> 01:12:35.880
They all look like Katy Perry.

01:12:35.880 --> 01:12:38.480
They all, all of them look like Katy Perry.

01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:41.880
It's like an invasion of the body snatchers thing going on down there.

01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:42.880
Yeah.

01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:43.880
It's weird.

01:12:43.880 --> 01:12:47.440
It's, I mean, I've only, I've never, have I been to Southern California?

01:12:47.440 --> 01:12:49.120
That's like, that's like LA, right?

01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:50.120
Is that Southern California?

01:12:50.120 --> 01:12:51.120
Does that count?

01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:52.120
Fundamentally?

01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:53.120
Yeah.

01:12:53.120 --> 01:12:54.120
It's so, just so many shawties.

01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:55.120
I don't know.

01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:56.120
I've watched a lot of OC.

01:12:56.120 --> 01:12:57.120
A lot of bangin' beauties.

01:12:57.120 --> 01:12:58.120
Too much OC.

01:12:58.120 --> 01:12:59.120
A lot of Billsons.

01:12:59.120 --> 01:13:00.120
Too much OC, some people would say.

01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:01.120
Some would say.

01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:03.040
I think Tim has a rock solid will.

01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:05.440
I think he's going to be all right.

01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:07.720
Can I, can I tell you guys the truth?

01:13:07.720 --> 01:13:09.400
Can I disagree with you guys?

01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:10.680
I'm going to disagree with you guys.

01:13:10.680 --> 01:13:15.000
And this is me stepping away from Justin, giving you advice for what's best for your

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:16.000
life.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:21.960
And this is just my honest, like from the heart, this is, this is the case.

01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:26.160
I don't, I don't think you should move away from your wife for two years.

01:13:26.160 --> 01:13:32.640
I mean, I understand your career and I understand that, I understand that that's important.

01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:38.560
And maybe this is like a once in a lifetime opportunity.

01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:43.920
And you're, and you're going to, and it's totally worth this, but you've been married

01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:50.800
for eight months and the, these first couple of years are some of the best, like in terms

01:13:50.800 --> 01:13:58.520
of learning about each other and kind of forging your relationship and growing as a couple.

01:13:58.520 --> 01:14:01.040
And you're going to, you're going to miss out on those.

01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:05.400
I mean, you're going to, you're, you're going to miss out on some stuff.

01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:08.960
And maybe this job is like so worth it and it's, and you know, you need to do it.

01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:14.480
It's like going to, you know, America from the old country to try to build a life for

01:14:14.480 --> 01:14:15.480
your family.

01:14:15.480 --> 01:14:19.480
If there's that sort of situation and this is a question of necessity, I get it.

01:14:19.480 --> 01:14:24.560
But if you're on the run from religious persecution, yeah, exactly.

01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:25.560
Then yeah, sure.

01:14:25.560 --> 01:14:26.560
I get it.

01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:29.800
It sounds like you're saying the answer to this question is it's time to do a lot of

01:14:29.800 --> 01:14:30.800
soul searching.

01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:34.400
I know you, I really think, and I'm not saying like, so you guys should break up like that

01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:38.280
cause you're married and that's not really an option, but I mean, really think about

01:14:38.280 --> 01:14:41.720
why you're not in my religion.

01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:47.500
I really think about why you're doing it because you love this girl and you guys just got married

01:14:47.500 --> 01:14:51.800
and you are, and I'm not saying it's going to jeopardize your relationship.

01:14:51.800 --> 01:14:55.040
I'm just saying you're going to miss out a lot on a lot.

01:14:55.040 --> 01:14:58.080
And I know with technology and stuff, it can be very tempting to say, well, well, you know,

01:14:58.080 --> 01:15:00.360
we'll Skype every night and I'll just tweet out and that's probably true.

01:15:00.360 --> 01:15:05.600
I'll just get at her on form spring, ask her anonymous questions about what she did that

01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:06.600
day.

01:15:06.600 --> 01:15:08.920
But I, I don't know, really think about it, Tim.

01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:13.440
I think it'll be, I think you'll, you'll make it, but I, you love this girl and you just

01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:17.800
got married, you're newlyweds and that's a great period and I hate for you to miss out

01:15:17.800 --> 01:15:18.800
on it.

01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:19.800
That's just me.

01:15:19.800 --> 01:15:20.800
That's not advice, Justin.

01:15:20.800 --> 01:15:22.840
That's just from the heart, Justin.

01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:23.840
Yeah.

01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:26.680
If it's from the heart, Travis, I wouldn't do it either.

01:15:26.680 --> 01:15:30.920
But if you're dead set on doing it, advice, Travis says, do it, but it's going to suck.

01:15:30.920 --> 01:15:35.400
Your wife is, your wife is super hot.

01:15:35.400 --> 01:15:36.400
That's all I got.

01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:37.920
Just thought I'd comment on it.

01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:38.920
Your wife is super hot.

01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:43.400
That's got to, that's got to put some, put some, you know, English on the ball, right?

01:15:43.400 --> 01:15:44.400
Little English.

01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:45.880
Little English on that ball because your wife's super hot.

01:15:45.880 --> 01:15:49.080
So maybe don't leave her for two years because you're going to go to SoCal where all the

01:15:49.080 --> 01:15:51.560
honey bunnies are smoking, piping hot.

01:15:51.560 --> 01:15:54.200
Oop, don't touch that plate's hot.

01:15:54.200 --> 01:15:58.760
So shows your wife and she lives in New England and she's going to have all kinds of, Tom

01:15:58.760 --> 01:16:03.320
Brady's going to come up to her and try and throw a touchdown on your wife.

01:16:03.320 --> 01:16:04.320
Yeah.

01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:07.960
You know how guys in New England, he's going to throw a touchdown at your wife.

01:16:07.960 --> 01:16:11.760
Listen, you got to be careful because Tom Brady will scoop up your wife and you're going

01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:16.360
to scoop up, you know, all the Marissa's and Summers you can handle.

01:16:16.360 --> 01:16:18.740
Just be, just don't do it.

01:16:18.740 --> 01:16:21.840
You don't want, listen, you're going to, she's going to be in New England.

01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:23.380
We've really turned around.

01:16:23.380 --> 01:16:26.320
Some guy in overalls is going to come up to her and be like, oh, you want to go to the

01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:27.320
old butt in that tree?

01:16:27.320 --> 01:16:29.880
You want to go have a smooch?

01:16:29.880 --> 01:16:30.880
There's a Norissa blowing.

01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:31.880
There's a Norissa blowing.

01:16:31.880 --> 01:16:33.680
Come check out my orchard.

01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:41.200
Some founding father is going to sign some parliamentary actions on her, on that ass.

01:16:41.200 --> 01:16:42.960
Tim, just don't do it.

01:16:42.960 --> 01:16:43.960
Not worth it.

01:16:43.960 --> 01:16:45.880
Tim, Tim, we flipped.

01:16:45.880 --> 01:16:51.160
Someone's going to crack her Liberty Bell and that's in New England, right?

01:16:51.160 --> 01:16:53.160
Dog, where do you think New England is?

01:16:53.160 --> 01:16:55.040
You're making me so mad.

01:16:55.040 --> 01:16:59.480
You're referencing Philadelphia and I don't understand why.

01:16:59.480 --> 01:17:01.480
Is Philly not part of New England?

01:17:01.480 --> 01:17:02.480
No.

01:17:02.480 --> 01:17:03.480
No, dog, no.

01:17:03.480 --> 01:17:05.520
It always seems sort of ambiguous to me.

01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:06.520
Has it to you?

01:17:06.520 --> 01:17:07.520
It's like, ooh, that way.

01:17:07.520 --> 01:17:11.120
Once you get north up and there's trees and shit, you made it.

01:17:11.120 --> 01:17:14.720
Can I just say, Griffin, chances are that it seems ambiguous to you, but to the rest

01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:16.480
of the population it's probably pretty clear.

01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:17.480
Yeah.

01:17:17.480 --> 01:17:18.480
Probably.

01:17:18.480 --> 01:17:21.280
I'm almost certain there's a set amount of states that exist within New England.

01:17:21.280 --> 01:17:24.360
Now Tom Brady, he plays for the New England Patriots, right?

01:17:24.360 --> 01:17:25.360
Yes.

01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:26.360
Right.

01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:27.360
That one was good.

01:17:27.360 --> 01:17:28.360
That's why we were all kind of laughing and playing along.

01:17:28.360 --> 01:17:29.360
Listen.

01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:31.640
Does that make some sort of fucking sense?

01:17:31.640 --> 01:17:35.200
Listen, everyone who's listening, continue to listen.

01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:36.240
We need to buy Griffin-

01:17:36.240 --> 01:17:38.520
I got to go to some fucking night classes.

01:17:38.520 --> 01:17:41.280
I need to get my Rand McNally on.

01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:43.520
That's so bad.

01:17:43.520 --> 01:17:47.160
It's gotten really serious over here.

01:17:47.160 --> 01:17:51.800
You know, they say that ignorance isn't a problem unless it interferes with your podcasting,

01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:53.040
and this is seriously getting to be an issue.

01:17:53.040 --> 01:17:56.680
I made two jokes that didn't make a goddamn lick of sense.

01:17:56.680 --> 01:18:02.280
Griffin was like, and then go to see Rushmore.

01:18:02.280 --> 01:18:03.280
Where's the Alamo?

01:18:03.280 --> 01:18:04.280
I don't know.

01:18:04.280 --> 01:18:05.280
Please help me out.

01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:08.280
You guys want to hit up an Indian reservation?

01:18:08.280 --> 01:18:10.600
Tim and closing.

01:18:10.600 --> 01:18:11.600
Don't do it.

01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:12.600
That's me.

01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:13.600
That's where I'm at.

01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:14.600
Seriously.

01:18:14.600 --> 01:18:17.400
I was like, I think you guys will wreck your relationship.

01:18:17.400 --> 01:18:19.760
I just think you're going to miss a lot, and I don't think you should do it.

01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:24.120
But if you do do it, I'm sure it'll be fine, and you'll get through it.

01:18:24.120 --> 01:18:25.560
I hate for you to miss out.

01:18:25.560 --> 01:18:29.800
I hate for Tom Brady to scoop your snoot.

01:18:29.800 --> 01:18:33.280
I hate for your snoot to be scooped by Tom Brady, as they say.

01:18:33.280 --> 01:18:38.800
I'm going to get a t-shirt that says that my snoot dumbed scoop by Tom Brady, footballer,

01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:41.080
popular footballer Tom Brady.

01:18:41.080 --> 01:18:42.080
Known leatherhead.

01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:46.440
That's what they call footballers.

01:18:46.440 --> 01:18:47.440
That's good to see.

01:18:47.440 --> 01:18:48.440
Now you're back on.

01:18:48.440 --> 01:18:49.520
You're just 50 years in the past.

01:18:49.520 --> 01:18:50.520
Maybe 100.

01:18:50.520 --> 01:18:53.960
So do you want to move on to our last question?

01:18:53.960 --> 01:18:58.240
We want to wrap this production up.

01:18:58.240 --> 01:19:06.120
Before we do that, real quick, because you guys have been so indulgent to listen to our

01:19:06.120 --> 01:19:10.680
request for your help, our pleading, if you will.

01:19:10.680 --> 01:19:15.680

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:25.000
It's formspring.com.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:32.120
Is it formspring.me, my brother, my brother, and me, or nbmbam, is that right?

01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:34.820
Formspring.me, nbmbam.

01:19:34.820 --> 01:19:40.640
We love to see on Twitter quotes, things like that, just encouraging people to listen.

01:19:40.640 --> 01:19:45.600
And you guys have helped us spread the show so much.

01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:50.920

Speaking of Twitter, if you do donate, let us know on Twitter.

01:19:56.400 --> 01:20:02.640
Listen, I'm usually not down with those people who are like, I just gave 25 bucks to save

01:20:02.640 --> 01:20:03.640
the children.

01:20:03.640 --> 01:20:04.640
Like, fuck those guys.

01:20:04.640 --> 01:20:05.640
But this is way better than children.

01:20:05.640 --> 01:20:07.400
This is 100 times better than save the children.

01:20:07.400 --> 01:20:11.920
If you donate, let us know on Twitter, and we'll shout you back.

01:20:11.920 --> 01:20:13.360

Is that something that you'd be into?

Thanks DrWoofles.

How can I walk up a wall? I want to walk up a wall.

01:21:20.800 --> 01:21:25.800
Square on the lips.

Keep your heart three stacks. Keep your heart.

01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:31.800
Keep your heart three stacks. Keep your heart.

01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:35.800
Man, these girls are smart. Three stacks, these girls are smart.

01:21:35.800 --> 01:22:02.800
Play your part.
