00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:46.640
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me,

00:46.640 --> 00:50.640
an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

00:50.640 --> 00:52.960
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

00:52.960 --> 00:58.480
And I'm your sweet baby brother, Borat, not April Fools.

00:58.480 --> 01:02.720
It is. Well, this is weird, because we're recording on April Fools,

01:02.720 --> 01:06.880
so all we want to talk about is April Fools. I don't know when you fools will be listening

01:06.880 --> 01:12.560
to this, but probably still in April. So every day in April is April for you fools.

01:12.560 --> 01:15.840
Please, no. Please, God, no. Please, God, please, please, no.

01:15.840 --> 01:18.720
We can't do goofs and jokes all month long.

01:18.720 --> 01:22.960
Well, yeah, if the jokes that we're doing is on the level as, like,

01:22.960 --> 01:26.480
my wife, Borat, April Fools. That's kind of been my style today.

01:26.480 --> 01:29.680
It's been very innocuous. Like, nobody's going to lose their fucking jobs over it.

01:29.680 --> 01:33.840
You know what I mean? Nobody's going to be offended by it.

01:33.840 --> 01:36.400
People are just going to have, like, a good belly laugh of just, like,

01:36.400 --> 01:39.040
that's not my bag, baby. And that's a joke from Austin Powers.

01:39.040 --> 01:40.000
April Fools.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.840
I want to pitch a new version of April Fools that I told Griffin about beforehand,

01:43.840 --> 01:45.200
and he was really on board with.

01:45.200 --> 01:47.920
Yeah, and I actually specifically told you not to float it.

01:47.920 --> 01:51.200
And I call it gay April Fools. Now, I know it's going to sound like I mean

01:51.200 --> 01:54.800
gay April Fools. That is not what I mean. I mean gape Rule Fools.

01:54.800 --> 01:59.440
So, like, you set up your hilarious jape. Oh, I should have said jape Rule Fools.

01:59.440 --> 02:01.440
And it's too late. You set up your hilarious goo.

02:01.440 --> 02:02.640
No, it's not too late. So, we got to go back.

02:02.640 --> 02:05.520
Maybe, like, you put some Saran wrap over the turdlet, right?

02:05.520 --> 02:07.760
So that when someone tries to use it, there's just urine everywhere.

02:07.760 --> 02:08.960
And they get really mad.

02:08.960 --> 02:10.800
What if they shit and the shit pools up and gets all over their butt?

02:10.800 --> 02:14.800
The shit goes everywhere. And then you kick in the door, like,

02:14.800 --> 02:17.520
hello, my name is Borat, not April Fools.

02:17.520 --> 02:19.760
And they try to get mad, but when they look over,

02:19.760 --> 02:21.840
you're just spreading your butthole really, really wide.

02:21.840 --> 02:22.720
And they're like, oh, I can't be mad.

02:22.720 --> 02:26.880
This is a visceral fucking tableau that you've painted that I've just gotten

02:26.880 --> 02:31.440
my own fecal matter all over myself because of your jape rolls.

02:31.440 --> 02:38.640
And then I look up and I say, Travis, no. And you've got your little,

02:38.640 --> 02:40.480
you got your booty plum right there.

02:42.560 --> 02:45.200
And you laugh, right? And you laugh.

02:45.200 --> 02:47.120
And we all feel better about the day.

02:47.120 --> 02:49.840
And we think about what it really means to be alive for once.

02:49.840 --> 02:53.200
I think I would definitely have a good laugh at that, not April Fools.

02:53.200 --> 02:58.400
Now, I wasn't sure what Gaper meant, so I took it to Urban Dictionary.

02:58.400 --> 02:59.120
Uh-oh.

02:59.120 --> 03:05.200
And good news, it means something completely different on the Urban Dictionary.

03:06.080 --> 03:11.840
A Gaper, now hang with me here, is a skier or snowboarder who's completely clueless.

03:11.840 --> 03:14.960
It's usually distinguished by their bright colored clothes and a Gaper gap,

03:14.960 --> 03:17.920
which is the gap between goggles and helmet or hat.

03:17.920 --> 03:23.120
Gapers also do the Gaper tuck, which is an attempt at being a ski racer by tucking.

03:23.120 --> 03:26.080
However, it is done incorrectly with the poles sticking straight up,

03:26.080 --> 03:28.960
like thunderbolted lightning, very, very frightening.

03:28.960 --> 03:30.640
Yeah, definitely.

03:30.640 --> 03:32.000
So yeah, that's Gaper.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.960
Now, the snake eats itself here on Urban Dictionary,

03:34.960 --> 03:37.920
which is the new source as far as I'm concerned.

03:37.920 --> 03:40.160
I'm done with everything else but Urban Dictionary.

03:40.160 --> 03:43.920
I spent five minutes on this site and I already think it's the best thing to happen to me ever.

03:43.920 --> 03:47.840
A Gaper is a term used, this is the third most popular definition.

03:47.840 --> 03:54.080
It is a term used by D-Bags to degrade new skiers in an effort to boost their own self-esteem.

03:54.080 --> 03:54.240
Yeah.

03:54.240 --> 03:57.360
You can usually spot them by staring at others while on a lift chair

03:57.360 --> 04:00.240
or defining the word Gaper on Urban Dictionary.

04:00.240 --> 04:02.800
So it's like, whoa, Ouroboros.

04:02.800 --> 04:08.080
They should let this functionality be in Wikipedia where you can look at the series of edits

04:08.080 --> 04:11.760
and it's like, fuck whoever said Garfield is a tabby.

04:11.760 --> 04:13.760
Garfield is clearly a sphinx cat.

04:13.760 --> 04:16.960
Um, Justin, that's the first and third.

04:16.960 --> 04:23.120
Is the second one relating to spread butthole or is it a portmanteau of gay caper,

04:23.120 --> 04:24.960
which I would also be on board with?

04:26.160 --> 04:26.960
Um, no.

04:26.960 --> 04:31.440
The second one begins, and this is all I'm going to read, a skier or snowboarder who sucks.

04:31.440 --> 04:31.920
Okay.

04:31.920 --> 04:33.040
Well, okay.

04:33.040 --> 04:38.480
Is usually spotted wearing clothing from 1983, but other clothing styles for them do exist.

04:38.480 --> 04:42.880
And then the fourth one is like somebody who spreads their asshole way, way, way open

04:42.880 --> 04:44.480
so you can use them like a telescope.

04:44.480 --> 04:47.280
And then the fifth one is like, whoa, number four.

04:47.280 --> 04:49.360
Hey, fucking chill.

04:49.360 --> 04:51.840
We're talking about like cool boarders 1080 over here.

04:51.840 --> 04:53.520
Like, can you slow down?

04:53.520 --> 04:57.440
And number six is like, I'm with, I know me and number five had our differences earlier

04:57.440 --> 05:00.160
on in this dictionary entry, but I have to agree.

05:00.160 --> 05:03.360
Number four, you took it to a place that I'm not entirely comfortable with.

05:03.360 --> 05:08.640
Now I should mention my first definition dates back to January 3rd, 2006.

05:08.640 --> 05:10.640
And this was before butt play was even sort of a concept.

05:10.640 --> 05:13.040
Yeah, before butt play even existed.

05:13.040 --> 05:13.600
Yeah.

05:13.600 --> 05:20.240
If you're curious on the sidebar related to this term, there are many, many, many, many,

05:20.240 --> 05:22.480
many, many other definitions of gape.

05:22.480 --> 05:24.480
Just, just so many.

05:24.480 --> 05:25.200
Here's one.

05:25.200 --> 05:26.160
Gape tape.

05:26.160 --> 05:27.520
Not even going there with you.

05:28.240 --> 05:29.440
Go there yourself.

05:29.440 --> 05:30.240
I can't.

05:30.240 --> 05:37.360
Gape tape, the bubblegum that you get six feet of in a sweet little plastic clamshell package.

05:37.360 --> 05:38.160
I love it.

05:38.160 --> 05:42.080
I love how much gape tape I get with a single purchase at the checkout aisle.

05:42.080 --> 05:44.960
Six feet of gape tape for you, not them.

05:47.280 --> 05:48.720
This is my brother, my brother, me.

05:48.720 --> 05:51.120
And it's an advice show for the modern era.

05:51.120 --> 05:53.840
I'm really sorry that we didn't go with the vapor fools.

05:55.040 --> 05:55.760
It's not too late.

05:55.760 --> 05:57.280
We can still talk about vapor fools.

05:59.360 --> 06:03.840
I mean, the sound is going to be, we try not to blow too much into the microphones into

06:03.840 --> 06:06.160
the old condensers because it's not a good sound.

06:06.160 --> 06:09.520
But if we start talking about vaping, I'm going to get that fucking monkey on my back

06:09.520 --> 06:09.920
again.

06:09.920 --> 06:13.440
And then I'm going to just start blowing cotton directly into the ear lobes.

06:14.960 --> 06:18.560
Yeah, April Fool's, by the way, this I know this hasn't been very funny yet.

06:18.560 --> 06:19.280
That was the bit.

06:19.280 --> 06:21.200
This is a prank on you.

06:21.200 --> 06:23.760
And now we're going to start the real intro.

06:23.760 --> 06:24.240
Here we go.

06:25.520 --> 06:26.560
Hello, everybody, and welcome.

06:26.560 --> 06:29.520
My brother, my brother, me and advice show for the modern era.

06:30.240 --> 06:31.840
Welcome to vapor fools.

06:33.520 --> 06:34.160
Is that right?

06:34.160 --> 06:35.280
Is that what you nailed it?

06:35.280 --> 06:36.720
Listen at one.

06:37.440 --> 06:39.760
Everybody do one joke about vapor fools.

06:39.760 --> 06:44.720
Travis, I'm going to turn the old camera, the old podcast camera to you first.

06:44.720 --> 06:48.480
Smash cut, zoom in on Travis's face.

06:48.480 --> 06:49.760
He's framed perfectly.

06:50.480 --> 06:53.680
There's a boy yo yoing sound effect to let you know a joke's coming.

06:53.680 --> 06:57.920
And then I feel like I've stalled long enough and Travis turns to the camera and says,

06:57.920 --> 07:01.520
if you want your best vape tricks, turn the ohms all the way down.

07:01.520 --> 07:04.160
And that's like so that's the opposite of what is.

07:04.720 --> 07:05.200
Yeah.

07:05.200 --> 07:08.560
See, but then it like then, you know, if someone falls for that, they're a real gaper.

07:12.560 --> 07:15.040
There's two, there's two types of people in this world.

07:15.920 --> 07:16.320
Yeah.

07:16.320 --> 07:17.120
Gapers and vapors.

07:17.120 --> 07:17.840
Which one are you?

07:18.640 --> 07:20.000
Choose your side.

07:20.640 --> 07:21.920
Test your might.

07:22.800 --> 07:25.920
Gapers and vapors is probably my least favorite Dr. Seuss book.

07:25.920 --> 07:31.760
That was one of his earlier ones.

07:31.760 --> 07:33.440
That was by the way, also an April Fool's joke.

07:33.440 --> 07:35.280
It's absolutely my favorite.

07:36.480 --> 07:41.040
I learned about like the futility of war from Gapers v. Vapors.

07:43.040 --> 07:44.640
That was actually a landmark court case.

07:48.640 --> 07:51.040
I'm failing a class this semester at FSU.

07:52.480 --> 07:53.520
There is a way to routine.

07:53.520 --> 07:54.320
Wait, did we say that?

07:54.320 --> 07:56.640
There is a way to routine, wait, do we say our names?

07:56.640 --> 07:56.800
Yeah.

07:56.800 --> 07:58.560
I'm Griffin, he's Justin and Travis.

07:58.560 --> 07:59.360
Yeah, Travis.

07:59.360 --> 08:00.000
Okay.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.920
I'm failing a class this semester at FSU.

08:02.880 --> 08:05.200
There is a way to redeem some points and pass the class.

08:07.280 --> 08:12.800
The professor has this policy that if you turn in a student on social media during class,

08:13.920 --> 08:18.640
you will receive 25 bonus points, which equals 2.5 quiz grades.

08:18.640 --> 08:20.880
The person you turn in loses 10 points.

08:20.880 --> 08:21.760
Oh my God.

08:21.760 --> 08:22.400
Wait, hold on.

08:22.400 --> 08:24.160
If you turn in a student-

08:24.160 --> 08:26.960
Someone's on social media, you put them on blast.

08:27.840 --> 08:31.520
They get caught, they lose 10 points, you get 25.

08:31.520 --> 08:36.880
You see someone like sneaking their phone below the desk or table or whatever and you're like-

08:36.880 --> 08:38.960
That's fresh as fuck.

08:38.960 --> 08:46.240
That class, no matter what it is, like viral pathology, it's a viral pathology 101

08:46.240 --> 08:51.200
and also fucking Wild West gunslinging for one person who is the fucking law.

08:51.200 --> 08:54.720
Wait, keep reading through because the mechanics of it is what confuses me.

08:54.720 --> 08:57.200
This is all done, I mean, you want me to start again or-

08:57.200 --> 08:58.880
No, no, no, just the last couple of sentences.

08:58.880 --> 09:02.560
Okay, this is all done anonymously and I'm expecting not to have any serious consequences

09:02.560 --> 09:03.600
if I go through with it.

09:03.600 --> 09:10.400
So brothers, should I rat on the student to pass or keep my big mouth shut and retake the class?

09:10.400 --> 09:12.480
That's from Tainted in Tallahassee.

09:12.480 --> 09:14.080
So here's what confuses me.

09:14.880 --> 09:19.440
How does it put, like you see someone doing it and then you just go to the teacher afterwards

09:19.440 --> 09:24.000
and they're like, I saw, you know, I saw Steven on his phone.

09:24.560 --> 09:27.040
Or are you like snapping a picture of it?

09:27.040 --> 09:32.560
Or like, how do you do it anonymously with any kind of proof that this happened?

09:32.560 --> 09:33.520
Yeah, you snap a-

09:33.520 --> 09:38.320
I mean, you get a screenshot or I mean, if it's Tweet-O, you could give them a timestamp.

09:38.320 --> 09:41.040
But then I'm saying, Justin, it goes all the way back

09:41.040 --> 09:45.040
because then the guy behind you sees you on your phone looking at that person,

09:45.040 --> 09:47.200
like on that person's phone and then-

09:47.200 --> 09:54.560
Oh, are you saying it's like, it's like, it's like if you open your eyes during the prayer,

09:54.560 --> 09:57.840
the only people that can catch you are people who also open their eyes?

09:57.840 --> 09:59.360
Exactly, exactly.

09:59.360 --> 10:05.600
So now like, is that person gonna be like, Steve was on and you're like, no, I was watching that.

10:05.600 --> 10:10.640
I was following that person's Twitter activity so that I could tell you about it.

10:10.640 --> 10:12.000
I wasn't tweeting.

10:12.000 --> 10:17.840
I want to paint you guys a picture of me in this class and I'm failing it.

10:17.840 --> 10:20.480
Probably, this was probably during my doobie year.

10:20.480 --> 10:23.840
Yeah, everybody, I had a doobie year in college.

10:23.840 --> 10:26.480
I don't like to talk about it, develop some bad habits.

10:27.040 --> 10:31.280
But what if I was wearing my poncho to look like a cool Wild West gunslinger

10:31.280 --> 10:34.880
and also it was my doobie year so I was trying some stuff out.

10:34.880 --> 10:36.160
And what's that on my eye?

10:36.160 --> 10:37.200
Oh, it's Google Glass.

10:37.760 --> 10:39.200
Nobody has to fucking know.

10:39.200 --> 10:41.360
I'm watching you snap and I'm tweeting every-

10:41.360 --> 10:42.480
I'm gonna end this class.

10:42.480 --> 10:44.080
Griffin McElroy, congratulations.

10:44.080 --> 10:47.920
You have defeated my class with 320%.

10:48.560 --> 10:49.680
Holy shit.

10:49.680 --> 10:51.200
You like, and nobody else passed.

10:51.200 --> 10:53.840
You were the only person that passed because you ate all the grades.

10:53.840 --> 10:54.480
That's amazing.

10:54.480 --> 10:55.600
How did you do it?

10:55.600 --> 10:56.640
I'll never tell.

10:58.480 --> 11:05.120
And then you tip the brim of your Stetson and your Spurs chain because you walk out of the room.

11:05.120 --> 11:08.880
If I'm wearing Google Glass, it's a fedora because it's attached.

11:08.880 --> 11:11.920
Wait, it comes as a piece?

11:11.920 --> 11:17.920
Yeah, if you're wearing a Google Glass, it is attached by a fucking wallet chain to a fedora

11:17.920 --> 11:18.640
that you have to wear.

11:18.640 --> 11:19.680
It's what powers it.

11:19.680 --> 11:20.320
Just a shame.

11:22.560 --> 11:29.760
I mean, that's a great plan until you have 120% and everybody knows exactly how you fucking got it

11:29.760 --> 11:32.640
and everybody starts calling you Narc Ruffalo behind your back.

11:32.640 --> 11:33.840
Oh, that's the worst.

11:33.840 --> 11:37.120
And you go to like uncool jail where no one wants to hang out with you or invite you to

11:37.120 --> 11:38.160
any parties ever.

11:38.160 --> 11:38.720
Tough shit.

11:38.720 --> 11:40.880
You don't have to retake the class.

11:41.920 --> 11:42.960
Okay, Narc Harmon.

11:44.000 --> 11:49.200
I'm just saying I would give up a lot of social standing to not have to redo.

11:50.480 --> 11:56.880
You could just throw a kegger for free and make up for those points.

11:56.880 --> 11:57.440
You know what I mean?

11:58.480 --> 12:00.160
Okay, so someone comes to you and says,

12:00.160 --> 12:06.240
hey, we're going to a party at Narc Walberg's house.

12:06.240 --> 12:06.960
You want to come?

12:06.960 --> 12:09.120
And they're like, Narc in the funky bunch.

12:11.920 --> 12:12.800
And you think they're going to go?

12:12.800 --> 12:13.600
You think they're going to show?

12:13.600 --> 12:14.160
I don't think so.

12:14.160 --> 12:15.920
They're going to have a bunch of booze there for free.

12:15.920 --> 12:17.040
Also, this is college.

12:18.560 --> 12:20.080
I do think they're going to go there.

12:20.080 --> 12:24.880
Do you know what I love most about this whole scenario is this teacher has invented a situation

12:24.880 --> 12:26.160
where I can take his class.

12:26.720 --> 12:27.920
I would audit this class.

12:29.760 --> 12:31.200
Just to like narc people?

12:32.240 --> 12:34.800
You're saying narc and you're painting a negative picture.

12:34.800 --> 12:38.240
This is what I'm seeing is I'm fucking Roland.

12:38.240 --> 12:39.760
I'm the fucking gunslinger in there.

12:39.760 --> 12:42.000
And if I see you snapping, I'll be like,

12:42.000 --> 12:44.240
I'm there to make sure everybody else is learning.

12:44.240 --> 12:45.280
You know what I mean?

12:45.280 --> 12:48.480
You know what would be a teach power move in this class?

12:48.480 --> 12:51.760
If this was like a prisoner's dilemma kind of thing and you turn them in

12:51.760 --> 12:53.200
and then the teacher is like,

12:53.200 --> 12:55.600
well, I want you to know that this was the honey trap.

12:55.600 --> 13:00.800
I'm docking you 25 points for not paying attention to the class

13:00.800 --> 13:03.760
and instead trying to narc out other people when you should have been learning.

13:03.760 --> 13:04.260
Mmm.

13:05.120 --> 13:08.640
Or just he docks you for not being cool.

13:08.640 --> 13:10.640
Like you just lose points for being a narc.

13:10.640 --> 13:12.400
Yeah, that is how the prisoner's dilemma works.

13:12.400 --> 13:16.080
It's like, do you want to split the punishment?

13:16.080 --> 13:18.080
Do you want to split the time that you're going to be incarcerated?

13:18.080 --> 13:21.200
Or do you want to just take the guaranteed two years?

13:21.200 --> 13:23.360
And it's like, I want them to take it.

13:23.360 --> 13:24.880
It's like, not cool, bro.

13:24.880 --> 13:26.160
Prisoner's dilemma.

13:26.160 --> 13:26.660
Yep.

13:28.080 --> 13:30.800
I want to circle back to something because Griffin,

13:31.360 --> 13:32.640
I just wanted to mention,

13:32.640 --> 13:34.480
when you start talking about Google Glass,

13:34.480 --> 13:39.680
I thought you were saying that the person was using Google Glass to tweet.

13:39.680 --> 13:43.200
And I think that would be probably like dictating a tweet to your Google Glass

13:43.200 --> 13:44.640
is probably the best way to get caught.

13:45.280 --> 13:47.680
Yeah, in boarding class again.

13:47.680 --> 13:49.760
Mr. Johnston is so dull.

13:49.760 --> 13:51.040
Can't wait to blaze it.

13:51.040 --> 13:52.400
Hashtag 420.

13:52.400 --> 13:53.600
Can't wait to blaze it.

13:53.600 --> 13:55.680
He's got a nice fat ass though.

13:55.680 --> 13:58.640
I love that fucking fat ass.

13:58.640 --> 14:00.800
Hashtag scrum diddle dumpsus.

14:00.800 --> 14:03.760
And then you just turn behind.

14:03.760 --> 14:05.360
You're like, yeah, Narc Rylance.

14:05.360 --> 14:06.000
I was.

14:06.000 --> 14:06.400
I was.

14:07.040 --> 14:09.920
How many famous Narcs does Justin know?

14:09.920 --> 14:11.280
I'm actually only doing actors.

14:11.280 --> 14:13.200
I can move on to authors if you'd like.

14:13.200 --> 14:15.840
Narc Twain is the best, yeah.

14:17.200 --> 14:20.160
Let's address a challenging Yahoo.

14:20.160 --> 14:20.640
Okay.

14:20.640 --> 14:21.680
Sent in by Level 9000.

14:21.680 --> 14:22.960
Yajur Jiriju government port.

14:22.960 --> 14:23.440
Thank you, Jiriju.

14:23.440 --> 14:25.200
It's by Yajur Answers user Jeff.

14:25.200 --> 14:27.360
Way to secure a primo username.

14:28.160 --> 14:28.880
Jeff asks,

14:28.880 --> 14:32.160
in mythology and folklore,

14:33.440 --> 14:36.240
what would happen if everyone in the United States

14:36.240 --> 14:38.800
flushed their toilets all at the same exact time?

14:40.000 --> 14:40.320
Who?

14:41.040 --> 14:43.040
Think the world would explode, yeah?

14:43.040 --> 14:43.280
Who, boy?

14:43.280 --> 14:45.120
Like just from too much pressure.

14:46.480 --> 14:47.520
Like the whole world,

14:47.520 --> 14:49.280
like the mantle of the earth would crack

14:49.280 --> 14:52.400
and just there's too much stuff going down into there

14:52.400 --> 14:53.600
and it would just kind of-

14:53.600 --> 14:55.440
Listen, we can all laugh and stuff,

14:55.440 --> 14:58.800
but like there would be a significant difference

14:59.520 --> 15:02.080
in the water level of something somewhere.

15:02.640 --> 15:04.800
Yeah, like the Pacific Ocean would just be like, bye.

15:05.360 --> 15:06.720
I don't know how it's all gonna-

15:06.720 --> 15:12.320
I'm not gonna fence myself in by saying a specific point.

15:12.320 --> 15:12.800
Yeah.

15:12.800 --> 15:14.480
But I feel like-

15:14.480 --> 15:16.160
Well, it would be on the opposite end of the world, right?

15:16.160 --> 15:17.920
So like the Indian Ocean then, for us.

15:17.920 --> 15:19.680
It would probably be the Indian Ocean.

15:19.680 --> 15:20.720
And that's a little ocean.

15:20.720 --> 15:22.640
That's the littlest of the oceans, I think, so.

15:22.640 --> 15:26.160
Where does that water even go and or come from?

15:26.720 --> 15:31.920
I think that every toilet is connected to another toilet in America

15:31.920 --> 15:33.200
so that when you flush,

15:33.760 --> 15:35.920
that water goes into someone else's toilet.

15:35.920 --> 15:37.360
But I know what you're thinking, gross.

15:37.360 --> 15:39.760
But there's a filter between there, you guys.

15:39.760 --> 15:40.400
You know what I mean?

15:40.400 --> 15:41.520
Like we're talking-

15:41.520 --> 15:44.560
This is like alternating current of toilets.

15:45.200 --> 15:46.720
Every toilet is connected.

15:46.720 --> 15:49.440
So you're just like, do you get to choose?

15:49.440 --> 15:55.280
No, but if you can find the person, you flush a note down.

15:55.280 --> 15:56.640
It's the quickest way.

15:56.640 --> 15:57.920
It is weird to think about,

15:58.880 --> 16:03.360
because all the water is the same water that was here when Earth started,

16:03.360 --> 16:05.840
that every time you take a drink,

16:05.840 --> 16:09.040
at least like one particle of that is from toilet water

16:09.040 --> 16:12.080
when like Julius Caesar had like nasty Taco Bell.

16:12.080 --> 16:19.600
There's one particle of that toilet bowl water in every drink you take, really.

16:19.600 --> 16:22.080
Yeah, that's cool to talk about.

16:22.640 --> 16:24.080
It's not cool to talk about.

16:24.640 --> 16:25.360
It's a fact.

16:25.360 --> 16:26.400
It's a science fact.

16:26.400 --> 16:27.280
It's just a thing.

16:28.320 --> 16:30.880
What if I only drink like boxed water from now on?

16:30.880 --> 16:34.400
Am I gonna be safe from Julius Caesar's Taco Bell particles?

16:34.400 --> 16:36.080
It's all the same water.

16:36.640 --> 16:37.920
Yeah, it's all the same water.

16:37.920 --> 16:40.160
I mean like a lot of it is melted glacier, sorry.

16:40.160 --> 16:42.560
Yeah, I mean they're not making new water, huh?

16:42.560 --> 16:43.840
They're not making new water.

16:43.840 --> 16:45.200
It's like the same water.

16:45.200 --> 16:48.000
Until we get more of that space rain that started the Earth.

16:48.640 --> 16:50.080
We're not gonna get any new water.

16:50.080 --> 16:53.360
So every time you drink water, a dinosaur shit in it.

16:53.360 --> 16:54.720
A dinosaur shit in that.

16:54.720 --> 16:57.920
I can't wait for all this space rain to come and watch Julius Caesar's poop away.

17:01.360 --> 17:02.720
That's a very empowering thought.

17:03.920 --> 17:05.680
It makes us all eternal in a way.

17:05.680 --> 17:08.880
And we've got a little bit of Julius Caesar's diarrhea in all of us.

17:08.880 --> 17:11.760
When you have nasty boy Taco Bell shits, you gotta think like,

17:11.760 --> 17:13.120
this is here forever.

17:13.120 --> 17:15.120
Like I've done a permanent thing to Earth.

17:16.240 --> 17:19.440
Like everybody worries about like I need to write a great novel

17:19.440 --> 17:22.080
or I need to like change one person's life.

17:22.080 --> 17:26.080
But every time you shit, you're paying it forward.

17:26.080 --> 17:27.040
You're pooping it forward.

17:27.040 --> 17:28.880
Is this what a, I had never understood the term,

17:28.880 --> 17:30.880
but is this what a carbon footprint is?

17:30.880 --> 17:32.480
Yeah, right, exactly.

17:32.480 --> 17:34.800
This is also what a Jerky Boys record sounds like,

17:34.800 --> 17:36.240
in case you hadn't listened to one of those.

17:36.240 --> 17:37.280
Well, let's just figure this out.

17:37.280 --> 17:39.200
I got a bunch of cardboard boxes in my garage

17:39.200 --> 17:40.560
because I just built a whole bunch of furniture.

17:40.560 --> 17:43.520
Should I just start pooping in those and then burying them, I guess?

17:43.520 --> 17:47.600
Yeah, honestly, we should just be burying our poop in our neighbor's yard.

17:47.600 --> 17:48.080
Yeah.

17:48.080 --> 17:48.800
That's green.

17:49.360 --> 17:50.880
That's how Dennis the Menace does it.

17:51.840 --> 17:52.880
That's why everybody's-

17:52.880 --> 17:54.240
And Dennis Kucinich.

17:54.240 --> 17:56.240
And Dennis Kucinich does it that way too.

17:57.120 --> 18:00.320
Man, I bet that fool feels like he missed his shot, huh?

18:00.320 --> 18:02.240
If he just hung in there another few years,

18:02.240 --> 18:04.080
he could probably be doing pretty good right now.

18:04.080 --> 18:07.520
Well, hey, listen, I work in an office and after lunch hour,

18:07.520 --> 18:10.800
one of my coworkers throws his plastic containers into the trash bin,

18:10.800 --> 18:13.440
despite the fact that recycle bins are right next to it

18:13.440 --> 18:15.600
and the containers are clearly marked as recyclable.

18:16.160 --> 18:17.840
I tried mentioning this to him,

18:17.840 --> 18:20.000
but have not been able to change his behavior.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.480
I resorted to rooting around the trash afterwards myself

18:22.480 --> 18:24.480
and separating out the recyclables.

18:24.480 --> 18:27.120
Brothers, how do I get people to separate their own recycling?

18:27.120 --> 18:29.920
That's from Vexed Vigilante in Vancouver.

18:29.920 --> 18:31.760
Well, I can tell you one thing.

18:31.760 --> 18:35.120
If you keep doing it, there's no way they're ever going to do it.

18:35.120 --> 18:36.160
Yeah, it's true.

18:36.160 --> 18:39.280
It's true, but you got to leave it back on their desk.

18:39.280 --> 18:41.360
Oh, it says try again.

18:41.360 --> 18:42.960
Try again, wrong tub.

18:43.520 --> 18:45.120
You're out of time reversal cubes.

18:46.080 --> 18:49.280
Well, can we- I hate that we have to keep going back to this well,

18:50.080 --> 18:51.600
but can we every time-

18:51.600 --> 18:52.720
Throw it in a well.

18:52.720 --> 18:54.800
Throw it down the recycling well.

18:55.840 --> 18:57.920
Do you guys remember the song that Borat did about

18:58.880 --> 19:00.480
throwing stuff down a well?

19:00.480 --> 19:02.000
Throwing stuff down a well?

19:02.000 --> 19:02.720
April Fools.

19:05.120 --> 19:07.120
I think the well I want to go back to

19:07.120 --> 19:09.440
is you put the recycling in the correct bin

19:09.440 --> 19:12.000
and then it turns into candy or a little toy.

19:13.200 --> 19:15.040
Oh, okay.

19:15.040 --> 19:16.080
So rewards.

19:16.080 --> 19:16.640
I love that.

19:17.200 --> 19:20.880
I mean, we're monkey people essentially

19:20.880 --> 19:24.480
and we need reinforcement to go into our brains.

19:25.040 --> 19:29.680
And so you put your can, your plastic container.

19:29.680 --> 19:31.120
What are these plastic containers

19:31.120 --> 19:32.880
that you're eating your lunch out of?

19:32.880 --> 19:36.400
This is my sandwich that came in a clamshell.

19:36.400 --> 19:37.600
What are the plastic containers?

19:37.600 --> 19:38.720
You just throw in Tupperware away?

19:38.720 --> 19:39.520
That's ridiculous.

19:40.080 --> 19:41.760
There's a lot of good use for that.

19:41.760 --> 19:45.280
Griffin's right because I find gamifying stuff

19:45.280 --> 19:47.280
is such a big thing these days.

19:47.280 --> 19:48.800
You need to turn this into a game

19:48.800 --> 19:53.120
and make somebody like the prime recycling winner for the week

19:53.120 --> 19:55.440
and they get something.

19:55.440 --> 19:56.000
You know what I mean?

19:56.000 --> 19:58.160
Who's the good, good recycle boy?

19:58.160 --> 20:00.080
And they get like, maybe it's a crown

20:00.080 --> 20:02.560
made out of old plastic containers

20:02.560 --> 20:05.600
or they get like a scepter made of soda cans taped together.

20:06.160 --> 20:08.800
And it's good because you don't have to spend any money

20:08.800 --> 20:11.280
or create any more waste and you recycled.

20:12.480 --> 20:14.800
Yeah, and you get to be my trash queen.

20:14.800 --> 20:16.000
Yeah, you could be like,

20:16.800 --> 20:21.200
and you could get like a trash, maybe a trash jester.

20:21.200 --> 20:23.760
The trash jester is the worst, right?

20:23.760 --> 20:27.520
That's the, he threw all his recyclables in the trash.

20:27.520 --> 20:29.600
So now he has to wear the trash diaper

20:30.400 --> 20:32.000
and it's an actual diaper.

20:32.000 --> 20:32.960
And it's been-

20:33.760 --> 20:34.560
It's been used.

20:35.680 --> 20:37.120
I don't think it's been used.

20:37.120 --> 20:38.800
I was thinking through it.

20:38.800 --> 20:40.000
It was used by Juicy,

20:40.000 --> 20:41.120
which is what I've just decided

20:41.120 --> 20:42.720
I'm only calling Julius Caesar from now on.

20:46.000 --> 20:49.040
I don't think, I don't think it's gonna,

20:50.240 --> 20:53.440
I mean, you're probably worrying too much about it.

20:53.440 --> 20:54.240
Let's put it that way.

20:54.240 --> 20:56.080
Listen, let's just put it this way.

20:56.080 --> 20:58.240
There's a lot of people throw recyclable plastics

20:58.240 --> 20:58.960
in the trash, huh?

21:00.080 --> 21:01.040
I'll tell you what though.

21:02.880 --> 21:04.320
If what I think is correct,

21:04.320 --> 21:06.320
the only way you could know that this person

21:06.320 --> 21:08.240
is throwing their shit away wrong

21:08.240 --> 21:10.160
is if you see them do it.

21:10.160 --> 21:12.240
At which one, I'd say throw caution to the wind

21:12.240 --> 21:13.440
and as soon as they do it, be like,

21:13.440 --> 21:14.480
hey, you did that wrong.

21:14.480 --> 21:15.520
That's not where that goes.

21:16.640 --> 21:18.640
Because if you're waiting till,

21:18.640 --> 21:20.400
you gotta, they're like, it's like a dog.

21:20.400 --> 21:21.920
You gotta catch them in the act.

21:21.920 --> 21:23.520
Because if you wait till later,

21:23.520 --> 21:26.240
you're like you're missing prime shame opportunity.

21:26.240 --> 21:27.280
You gotta say it in the moment like,

21:27.280 --> 21:30.480
hey, I saw you do that and you did it wrong.

21:30.480 --> 21:31.520
I've got a great idea.

21:31.520 --> 21:32.640
No one else is gonna do it.

21:32.640 --> 21:33.680
Now you have to do it.

21:33.680 --> 21:36.160
I believe deep down you wouldn't have to say anything.

21:36.160 --> 21:37.520
I think if you're sitting there

21:37.520 --> 21:39.200
and when they walk towards the cans,

21:39.200 --> 21:40.320
you have a look on your face like,

21:40.320 --> 21:42.000
here comes a good recycle boy.

21:42.000 --> 21:42.240
Yeah.

21:42.240 --> 21:43.120
Just wait patiently.

21:43.120 --> 21:44.800
Can't wait to be, can't wait to be proud of you.

21:45.440 --> 21:46.880
Here comes a good one.

21:46.880 --> 21:48.080
Yeah, here comes a good boy.

21:48.080 --> 21:50.800
Hey everybody, watch Dave see how it's done.

21:50.800 --> 21:52.560
He's gonna show you how it's done.

21:52.560 --> 21:53.680
I think we should start.

21:53.680 --> 21:56.320
Oh God, before they get up to the cans,

21:56.320 --> 21:59.040
start telling him a story about some asshole

21:59.040 --> 22:00.480
who was just in the break room

22:00.480 --> 22:02.960
that put their plastic into the trash.

22:02.960 --> 22:03.520
Yeah.

22:03.520 --> 22:04.640
Like, can you believe this?

22:04.640 --> 22:06.000
A real goofus.

22:06.000 --> 22:07.600
Can you believe Karen?

22:07.600 --> 22:09.440
Can you believe Karen?

22:09.440 --> 22:14.880
Throwing her recycle, her Dasani bottle into the trash.

22:14.880 --> 22:15.920
Like the devil.

22:16.880 --> 22:18.160
Like a real gaper.

22:18.160 --> 22:24.000
I think we should all be given licenses.

22:25.200 --> 22:27.280
And when you have the,

22:27.280 --> 22:29.280
we'll call it a good recycle boy license.

22:30.800 --> 22:31.920
And it's gender neutral.

22:31.920 --> 22:32.880
It's just what they called it.

22:32.880 --> 22:33.440
I don't know.

22:33.440 --> 22:34.720
Take it up with the EPA, I guess.

22:34.720 --> 22:36.560
BOI, BOI.

22:36.560 --> 22:37.280
If you're a boy,

22:39.200 --> 22:41.200
then you get to sit on those park benches

22:41.200 --> 22:44.000
that they made out of old cups or whatever.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.240
And you get to read those books

22:46.240 --> 22:48.240
made out of like reclaimed papers.

22:48.240 --> 22:49.840
And you get to go in like,

22:51.040 --> 22:52.720
you know, the tiny houses

22:52.720 --> 22:54.160
that are made of reclaimed woods.

22:54.800 --> 22:56.560
Anything that is made of recycled stuff,

22:56.560 --> 22:58.880
you can do it until you're a bad recycle boy.

22:59.600 --> 23:00.560
And then you don't-

23:00.560 --> 23:03.120
Then you pass right through those things.

23:03.120 --> 23:07.840
Yeah, you clip through those reclaimed park benches.

23:09.360 --> 23:10.240
You just can't.

23:10.880 --> 23:12.240
You can't interact with it.

23:12.240 --> 23:18.240
You become a recycle ghost.

23:18.240 --> 23:19.600
Does that help?

23:19.600 --> 23:20.000
Yep.

23:20.000 --> 23:20.720
It doesn't hurt.

23:20.720 --> 23:22.000
How about this Yahoo though?

23:22.880 --> 23:24.640
We'll see if we can get some hurt out of this one.

23:25.200 --> 23:27.360
And it was sent in by-

23:27.360 --> 23:29.200
This one was sent in by Nicole Harris.

23:29.200 --> 23:30.240
Thank you, Nicole Harris,

23:30.240 --> 23:32.720
with a time leak April Fool's Day question.

23:33.360 --> 23:35.360
It's by Yahoo Answers user Dave.

23:36.640 --> 23:38.640
Real goof for that one, who asks,

23:38.640 --> 23:41.360
can you give me some summer camp prank ideas?

23:42.720 --> 23:45.840
I see a lot of unique ideas on summer camp pranks,

23:45.840 --> 23:46.960
and they are pretty good.

23:47.440 --> 23:49.360
I am looking for a different kind of prank

23:49.360 --> 23:52.240
than what I see when I search prank ideas.

23:52.960 --> 23:54.640
The kind of pranks I want to do

23:54.640 --> 23:57.040
are all ones that I have to sneak around

23:57.040 --> 23:59.200
in the middle of the night in full camouflage

23:59.200 --> 24:00.480
and pull the prank.

24:00.480 --> 24:02.240
I want it to be an adrenaline rush.

24:02.800 --> 24:04.160
I want to be a fucking bad boy.

24:04.160 --> 24:05.120
I want to be punished.

24:06.160 --> 24:07.360
I want to be an adrenaline rush

24:07.360 --> 24:09.120
where I have to sneak around to pull it.

24:09.120 --> 24:12.720
E.g. hooking an mp3 player to the PA system at night,

24:12.720 --> 24:15.360
playing a song, then sneaking back to my cabin

24:15.360 --> 24:16.960
without being caught.

24:20.960 --> 24:22.480
I don't want any answers,

24:22.480 --> 24:24.800
like where I put Vaseline on the door handles,

24:24.800 --> 24:26.560
putting food coloring in the soap,

24:26.560 --> 24:28.000
putting flour in a hairdryer,

24:28.000 --> 24:30.400
anything that I don't need to sneak around to pull it.

24:30.400 --> 24:32.000
I want to be caught and punished.

24:32.560 --> 24:34.640
P.s. my camp is in the woods in Ohio.

24:34.640 --> 24:36.240
There's a boys side, a girls side,

24:36.240 --> 24:38.720
a pool, and a big ravine that runs through the camp

24:38.720 --> 24:41.280
that has heavy vegetation and is good for hiding.

24:41.920 --> 24:43.440
From Punishers.

24:43.440 --> 24:47.280
I will be with a few friends as I pull the pranks,

24:47.280 --> 24:51.600
so please compensate a few other people into your idea.

24:51.600 --> 24:53.120
Well fuck, hold on.

24:53.120 --> 24:55.520
Okay, I need to redo some calculations then.

24:55.520 --> 24:56.480
Give me a second.

24:56.480 --> 24:58.240
Let me compensate for the pranks.

24:58.240 --> 24:59.680
How many kids?

24:59.680 --> 25:00.880
How tall are they?

25:00.880 --> 25:02.240
Are they blonde, brunette?

25:02.240 --> 25:04.640
Are they good sneakers, bad sneakers?

25:04.640 --> 25:06.640
Good sneakers, bad sneakers.

25:06.640 --> 25:09.040
Is one of them a little bit weird?

25:09.040 --> 25:10.400
Do they wear braces?

25:10.400 --> 25:12.080
Does any of them have asthma?

25:12.080 --> 25:13.360
Have they been caught before?

25:14.720 --> 25:16.960
Do they also share your proclivity

25:16.960 --> 25:20.080
for being caught by adults and punished?

25:20.080 --> 25:22.080
What songs are on your MP3 player?

25:22.640 --> 25:25.360
What kind of camo makeup do you have access to?

25:25.360 --> 25:27.360
What kind of vegetation is in the ravine?

25:27.360 --> 25:28.640
How deep is the ravine?

25:28.640 --> 25:30.560
Has anyone died in the ravine before?

25:30.560 --> 25:32.400
Could you bury a body in the ravine?

25:32.400 --> 25:34.400
How like dense is the soil?

25:34.400 --> 25:35.680
How loose is the gravel?

25:36.320 --> 25:38.320
What kind of security system do you have?

25:40.080 --> 25:42.480
Who's the best bunk in all of Camp Blasiatta?

25:42.480 --> 25:43.600
Bunk three, that's right.

25:44.960 --> 25:46.400
Bug juice, where does it come from?

25:46.400 --> 25:47.600
Does it come in a jar?

25:47.600 --> 25:49.280
No, it comes from who you are.

25:52.320 --> 25:54.080
There's a Yahoo answerer here

25:54.080 --> 25:56.720
who's provided a few suggestions.

25:56.720 --> 25:59.040
One suggestion is Vaseline on a doorknob.

26:00.800 --> 26:02.480
Jedi, that's their username.

26:02.480 --> 26:04.400
Jedi, it's like you didn't even listen.

26:04.400 --> 26:05.440
But here's their description.

26:05.440 --> 26:06.480
Maybe they went back in

26:06.480 --> 26:08.400
and edited that into the original question.

26:08.400 --> 26:10.240
Like, hey, hey, I see what you're doing.

26:11.040 --> 26:11.920
Vaseline on a doorknob.

26:11.920 --> 26:13.120
This is their description for it.

26:13.120 --> 26:14.560
Putting a little Vaseline on a doorknob

26:14.560 --> 26:16.560
makes it virtually impossible to open.

26:16.560 --> 26:17.760
If you're gonna pull this prank,

26:17.760 --> 26:20.480
don't place it on the doorknob inside a room.

26:20.480 --> 26:22.000
You don't wanna make it impossible

26:22.000 --> 26:23.520
for the room's occupants to leave

26:23.520 --> 26:24.720
if an emergency occurs.

26:25.680 --> 26:26.800
Well, okay.

26:26.800 --> 26:28.960
Oh shit, the chainsaw strangler's inside.

26:28.960 --> 26:29.760
Let's get out of here.

26:29.760 --> 26:30.880
Squeak, eek, eek, eek.

26:30.880 --> 26:32.080
Aw, fuck.

26:32.080 --> 26:34.560
Aw, got me again, Timothy.

26:34.560 --> 26:37.120
Wait, is the idea that you just can't get a grip on it?

26:37.120 --> 26:37.920
Yeah, you can't.

26:37.920 --> 26:38.640
Well, you should know this.

26:38.640 --> 26:42.320
What sort of, like, infant can't crack that?

26:42.320 --> 26:44.880
Like, it's Vaseline.

26:44.880 --> 26:46.160
Just wipe it off.

26:46.160 --> 26:47.360
Well, Justin, you should know this.

26:47.360 --> 26:48.720
Like, you know why that is,

26:48.720 --> 26:51.600
why jam is such an effective weapon

26:52.320 --> 26:54.640
in your fight for justice.

26:54.640 --> 26:55.600
I mean, yeah.

26:55.600 --> 26:57.040
I just always assumed jam

26:57.040 --> 26:59.200
increased the grip of the doorknob.

26:59.200 --> 27:00.320
Like, you couldn't let go of it.

27:00.320 --> 27:02.320
You stuck to it with preserves.

27:03.680 --> 27:06.240
You don't know what jelly is.

27:06.240 --> 27:06.800
Me?

27:06.800 --> 27:07.600
That's one thing.

27:07.600 --> 27:09.440
Yeah, that's one thing.

27:09.440 --> 27:12.880
Well, I was raised in a very religious household.

27:14.160 --> 27:16.240
Travis went to a Montessori school

27:16.240 --> 27:18.480
where that kind of behavior was not allowed.

27:18.480 --> 27:18.980
No.

27:20.800 --> 27:22.560
You know what would be a really good prank?

27:22.560 --> 27:23.680
What's that, Travis?

27:23.680 --> 27:24.400
Sneak around.

27:25.280 --> 27:27.680
Move all the clocks and calendars

27:27.680 --> 27:30.080
and everybody's phones forward a day

27:30.080 --> 27:32.160
so when it comes time for the parents to come,

27:32.160 --> 27:34.960
everybody thinks the parents forgot to pick everyone up.

27:34.960 --> 27:37.520
But really, you just move time forward

27:37.520 --> 27:39.840
24 hours on everybody's devices.

27:39.840 --> 27:41.200
Then you go out to the flagpole

27:41.200 --> 27:43.040
in the center of the camp

27:43.040 --> 27:44.720
and you pull your pants down

27:44.720 --> 27:46.640
and just have your butt out there

27:46.640 --> 27:47.360
and just wait for somebody to come spank you.

27:47.360 --> 27:48.880
I was getting there.

27:48.880 --> 27:50.320
Oh, sorry, sorry.

27:50.320 --> 27:51.760
And then you have Christopher Lloyd

27:51.760 --> 27:53.920
pretend to be the head of a new camp

27:53.920 --> 27:54.720
and you say,

27:54.720 --> 27:55.920
your parents didn't even want you.

27:55.920 --> 27:57.520
Come stay at this camp with me

27:57.520 --> 27:59.760
so that everyone comes and stays at the camp with you

27:59.760 --> 28:00.800
and over time,

28:00.800 --> 28:03.520
you eventually become sort of like a religious figure, right?

28:03.520 --> 28:05.200
And maybe you start your own college

28:05.200 --> 28:07.440
and you have everyone pretend like they're at college

28:07.440 --> 28:09.200
but really, it's not a real college

28:09.200 --> 28:10.000
but then in the end,

28:10.000 --> 28:12.480
you stand in front of some kind of accreditation board

28:12.480 --> 28:13.920
and it becomes a real college

28:13.920 --> 28:14.880
and then you bend over

28:14.880 --> 28:16.720
and you spread your butt really wide.

28:22.160 --> 28:22.800
I'd see it.

28:25.360 --> 28:26.320
You know, J-Long.

28:26.320 --> 28:30.480
More like Justin Wide.

28:30.480 --> 28:30.980
Wait.

28:31.600 --> 28:32.960
Hi, I'm Justin Wide.

28:32.960 --> 28:34.240
The porn Justin Long.

28:34.800 --> 28:35.760
I'm also just,

28:35.760 --> 28:36.800
I'm just Justin Long.

28:36.800 --> 28:39.120
I went with that for my porn Justin Long name.

28:39.120 --> 28:40.640
I'm Justin and Al.

28:40.640 --> 28:42.480
I also love porn.

28:42.480 --> 28:43.680
And hamburgers.

28:43.680 --> 28:44.320
And hamburgers.

28:46.720 --> 28:47.920
I'm Justin Dong.

28:47.920 --> 28:49.280
Get out of here, Justin Dong.

28:49.280 --> 28:50.480
You're too on the nose.

28:50.480 --> 28:51.520
That's not even funny.

28:51.520 --> 28:52.400
That's not even funny.

28:52.400 --> 28:55.600
Justin Dong.

28:55.600 --> 28:58.240
Any other fun rhymes with Justin Long

28:58.240 --> 29:00.880
or should we hop over to the Money Zone?

29:00.880 --> 29:01.680
I've been sitting here,

29:01.680 --> 29:03.120
I was stalling trying to think of more

29:03.120 --> 29:05.200
but I don't actually have any more so.

29:05.200 --> 29:13.600
Okay, well, let's get paid.

29:16.400 --> 29:17.600
Can I talk about Trunk Club?

29:18.400 --> 29:19.120
I wish you would.

29:19.120 --> 29:19.680
Please do.

29:20.160 --> 29:21.840
I would like to tell you about Trunk Club.

29:21.840 --> 29:23.200
I am a member.

29:23.200 --> 29:25.600
I got some jeans from Trunk Club

29:25.600 --> 29:27.280
and I shit you not.

29:27.280 --> 29:30.480
They are the greatest jeans I have ever worn.

29:30.480 --> 29:32.640
You know how sometimes you see people wear jeans

29:32.640 --> 29:35.600
to a function, to like a formal thing?

29:35.600 --> 29:37.920
Lin-Manuel Miranda wore jeans to the White House

29:37.920 --> 29:39.840
and I was like, how does he do it?

29:39.840 --> 29:41.120
And I'll tell you how he does it.

29:41.120 --> 29:42.560
Good jeans.

29:42.560 --> 29:45.040
Yeah, these ain't no stank ass jeans.

29:45.040 --> 29:46.080
These aren't your,

29:46.080 --> 29:48.320
these don't have carpenter hoops on them.

29:48.320 --> 29:50.400
No, these are like adult jeans.

29:50.400 --> 29:52.240
Which is a thing I didn't even know

29:52.240 --> 29:55.200
was physically possible until I went to Trunk Club.

29:55.200 --> 29:57.040
They hooked me up with some jeans,

29:57.040 --> 30:00.560
some like fancy socks, a really nice shirt,

30:00.560 --> 30:01.600
and they had everything.

30:01.600 --> 30:02.800
It was really cool.

30:02.800 --> 30:03.840
No exaggeration.

30:03.840 --> 30:06.080
I went and had a great time hanging out with my stylist.

30:06.080 --> 30:09.440
I got to go to an actual like brick and mortar like place

30:09.440 --> 30:10.560
and try on clothes.

30:10.560 --> 30:11.520
But here's the thing.

30:11.520 --> 30:13.120
The beautiful thing about Trunk Club

30:13.680 --> 30:16.720
is you can have that experience without going anywhere.

30:17.200 --> 30:18.880
They're gonna talk to you kind of like,

30:18.880 --> 30:20.960
they're gonna talk to you, kind of figure out

30:20.960 --> 30:23.280
what your deal is, what you're into,

30:23.280 --> 30:25.840
what kind of things you might need clothes for,

30:25.840 --> 30:27.840
and then they send them to you.

30:27.840 --> 30:28.880
You try them on.

30:29.440 --> 30:31.600
You see what you like, what you don't like,

30:31.600 --> 30:33.280
and you send back what you don't like,

30:33.280 --> 30:34.720
and you only pay for what you keep.

30:36.080 --> 30:37.520
It's an amazing deal.

30:38.080 --> 30:38.960
It'll help you.

30:38.960 --> 30:40.000
Maybe you've been trying to figure out

30:40.000 --> 30:41.520
how to dress more like an adult

30:41.520 --> 30:43.360
or really get your fashion game on point,

30:43.360 --> 30:45.440
but you don't even know what stores to go to.

30:46.000 --> 30:47.760
Trunk Club is for you.

30:47.760 --> 30:50.480

30:52.720 --> 30:54.880

all that kind of stuff,

30:56.640 --> 30:58.640
and you're assigned an expert stylist,

30:58.640 --> 31:00.400
and that stylist is gonna take care of you.

31:05.360 --> 31:07.200
You only pay for the clothes you keep.

31:07.200 --> 31:09.680
So go to trunkclub.com slash my brother.

31:10.480 --> 31:11.680
You got me thinking about jeans.

31:11.680 --> 31:13.840
I just had an amazing business idea.

31:13.840 --> 31:14.340
Okay.

31:16.240 --> 31:17.040
You know Jinkos?

31:17.040 --> 31:17.540
Yes.

31:18.640 --> 31:20.480
I learned this week that Jinkos,

31:20.480 --> 31:22.160
you know they got that wide leg.

31:22.160 --> 31:23.600
Yes, I am aware.

31:23.600 --> 31:24.800
Keep all kinds of secrets in there.

31:24.800 --> 31:27.040
Did you know that the measurement

31:27.040 --> 31:29.680
for the pant hole at the bottom

31:29.680 --> 31:30.640
where your foot lives

31:31.280 --> 31:34.720
is exactly as wide as the hip?

31:35.680 --> 31:37.920
So if you were like a size 32 Jinko,

31:37.920 --> 31:40.720
each leg hole is going to be 32 as well.

31:41.920 --> 31:42.880
Here's the business idea.

31:42.880 --> 31:43.440
Okay.

31:43.440 --> 31:45.600
Cut off each pant leg,

31:45.600 --> 31:47.680
and all of a sudden you have three

31:48.320 --> 31:51.840
equal length, equal size denim skirts.

31:52.640 --> 31:53.040
Okay.

31:53.840 --> 31:54.640
Business idea.

31:55.360 --> 31:56.720
You buy Jinkos,

31:56.720 --> 31:58.640
cut them up into three skirts,

31:58.640 --> 32:00.640
and then you resell them for triple profit.

32:00.640 --> 32:02.240
Also, there'd probably be like a sweet

32:02.240 --> 32:04.720
eight ball and dragon and stuff on there.

32:04.720 --> 32:05.280
Yeah, that's the thing.

32:05.280 --> 32:06.880
That's the point about Jinkos no one talks about.

32:06.880 --> 32:08.240
They talk about the big legs.

32:08.240 --> 32:09.520
What about the embroidery?

32:10.640 --> 32:12.080
Do you know what Jinkos stands for?

32:12.880 --> 32:13.040
What?

32:13.040 --> 32:15.120
Judge none, choose one.

32:15.120 --> 32:16.080
It's fucking cool.

32:16.080 --> 32:17.280
It doesn't mean anything.

32:17.280 --> 32:19.600
Anything is fucking really cool though.

32:19.600 --> 32:22.640
That's my idea I came up with for Infinity Dollars,

32:22.640 --> 32:24.240
and it sounds like you guys don't give a shit

32:24.240 --> 32:26.640
about tripling your money.

32:26.640 --> 32:27.760
How much money do you have right now?

32:27.760 --> 32:28.560
Triple it.

32:28.560 --> 32:29.680
Join my Jinko Army.

32:30.320 --> 32:30.880
Whoa.

32:30.880 --> 32:32.480
Join my army of Jinko skirts.

32:33.440 --> 32:35.360
I want to tell you all about Blue Apron if I can.

32:35.360 --> 32:36.160
Hell yes.

32:36.160 --> 32:38.080
I'm gonna get hungry though.

32:38.080 --> 32:39.520
Yeah, that's probably true.

32:40.080 --> 32:42.560
Blue Apron is amazing.

32:42.560 --> 32:43.520
It's changed my life.

32:43.520 --> 32:46.240
I cook like a few times a week now,

32:46.240 --> 32:48.960
and I used to not cook at all because I didn't know how.

32:48.960 --> 32:50.800
But using Blue Apron, I've learned to cook,

32:50.800 --> 32:53.440
and in doing so, I've created dozens and dozens

32:53.440 --> 32:54.880
of delicious meals.

32:55.600 --> 32:56.960
So for less than 10 bucks a meal,

32:56.960 --> 32:58.800
Blue Apron will deliver all the fresh ingredients

32:58.800 --> 33:00.800
you need to create home-cooked meals.

33:00.800 --> 33:03.040
Just follow some easy step-by-step instructions

33:03.040 --> 33:03.760
that they provide.

33:03.760 --> 33:07.200
All the ingredients are farm fresh.

33:07.920 --> 33:10.640
They're in season veggies most of the time,

33:10.640 --> 33:15.360
and good quality meats, and absolutely delicious.

33:15.360 --> 33:17.920
Every meal can be prepared in 10 minutes or less.

33:17.920 --> 33:19.440
You don't gotta go to the grocery store.

33:20.080 --> 33:21.840
They can change the ingredients based

33:21.840 --> 33:23.360
on your dietary preferences.

33:23.360 --> 33:26.400
And they make it a breeze to discover and prepare dishes

33:26.400 --> 33:29.520
like what are some of the hot ones that you guys have made?

33:29.520 --> 33:31.120
I made like a fried chicken,

33:32.000 --> 33:33.920
but what was weird is that the coating

33:33.920 --> 33:35.440
didn't have egg in it at all.

33:35.440 --> 33:37.200
It used like Greek yogurt and vinegar,

33:37.200 --> 33:38.400
and it was amazing.

33:38.400 --> 33:40.080
I had never had fried chicken like that before,

33:40.080 --> 33:41.600
and it was so much healthier.

33:41.600 --> 33:46.640
I had it in a ramen with ground pork.

33:46.640 --> 33:51.280
The triple, the triple, holy shit, that was good.

33:51.280 --> 33:52.160
Are you kidding me?

33:52.160 --> 33:53.280
Those are the best things I've ever eaten.

33:54.160 --> 33:56.160
Right now, you can get your first two meals for free.

33:56.160 --> 33:58.080
Just go to blueapron.com slash my brother.

33:58.080 --> 34:00.720
That's blueapron.com slash my brother.

34:00.720 --> 34:04.240
I'm not, this is not, I'm not talking out of my ass

34:04.240 --> 34:06.480
because they're supporting us financially.

34:06.480 --> 34:09.440
It's literally, it's literally changed my life.

34:09.440 --> 34:13.520
It has given me like stuff to do like a few nights a week,

34:13.520 --> 34:14.880
and it's really fun.

34:14.880 --> 34:16.320
Like you don't have to stress whether or not

34:16.320 --> 34:17.120
you've got the right shit.

34:17.120 --> 34:18.480
You've got the right shit.

34:18.480 --> 34:20.240
It's easy, and you learn how to cook.

34:20.240 --> 34:21.120
It's awesome.

34:21.120 --> 34:23.600
To give you an idea, here are some meals from this week.

34:23.600 --> 34:25.760
Crispy chicken cutlets with sugar snap peas,

34:25.760 --> 34:28.640
stir fried honey garlic shrimp with snow peas,

34:28.640 --> 34:32.000
cheeseburgers on English muffins with Roscoe's potatoes.

34:32.000 --> 34:33.680
Like, and there's even more.

34:33.680 --> 34:35.120
There's also vegetarian options.

34:35.120 --> 34:36.160
There's stuff for kids.

34:36.160 --> 34:36.640
It's great.

34:36.640 --> 34:39.360
What's Roscoe gonna do without his potatoes, though?

34:39.360 --> 34:40.240
He's gonna cry.

34:40.240 --> 34:40.720
He's gonna cry.

34:40.720 --> 34:42.080
Who's gonna eat those for dinner?

34:42.080 --> 34:43.520
Anyway, go to blueapron.com slash my brother.

34:43.520 --> 34:44.480
Well, let's ask him.

34:44.480 --> 34:48.080
Hey, it's me, Roscoe the Potato Man.

34:48.080 --> 34:50.880
What are you doing with the potatoes?

34:50.880 --> 34:52.160
You don't seem to understand.

34:52.160 --> 34:54.640
The potatoes make up my body.

34:55.280 --> 34:58.800
I got a Jumbotron message to Grace from Jake.

34:58.800 --> 35:02.720
Didn't want to explore the canon of Roscoe the Potato Man, huh?

35:02.720 --> 35:03.920
No, I, nah.

35:03.920 --> 35:07.600
The potatoes, I don't know if you heard the last bit, and maybe this will change your mind

35:07.600 --> 35:09.200
about whether or not you want to dig in.

35:09.200 --> 35:12.160
But the potatoes make up the form of his body.

35:14.000 --> 35:16.080
So this one's to Grace from Jake.

35:16.080 --> 35:17.360
I got lots of eyes.

35:18.320 --> 35:20.720
So wait, Griffin, is he like potatoes sewn together?

35:20.720 --> 35:23.680
Is he like Oogie Boogie and he's like a sack with potatoes in it?

35:23.680 --> 35:28.080
No one quite understands the dark magics that hold all my potato body together.

35:28.080 --> 35:31.360
But I'm saying, do you look at him and he's just a chain of potatoes forming a body,

35:31.360 --> 35:33.680
or is he like a sack boy with potatoes in it?

35:33.680 --> 35:35.120
Ah, no one's quite sure.

35:35.120 --> 35:37.040
I'm pretty hard to look at.

35:37.040 --> 35:38.400
Speech is energy.

35:38.400 --> 35:39.840
Thoughts are energy.

35:39.840 --> 35:42.880
This stuff reverberates around the planet, and you're letting him-

35:42.880 --> 35:45.040
This is Julius Caesar's diarrhea.

35:45.040 --> 35:51.840
Cart Blanche to just spread this like metaphorical Julius Caesar's diarrhea, like all across the-

35:51.840 --> 35:54.080
What are you letting who spread it?

35:54.080 --> 35:55.680
These ideas are persistent.

35:55.680 --> 36:00.880
By allowing Griffin to continue to establish the rich fiction of Roscoe the Potato Man,

36:00.880 --> 36:01.280
you are-

36:01.280 --> 36:04.080
That's not my name.

36:04.080 --> 36:04.640
What is it?

36:05.680 --> 36:07.920
Roscoe the King of the Potato Kingdom.

36:09.840 --> 36:12.400
It's a bit repetitive, but all my potato subjects-

36:12.400 --> 36:14.400
Hey, y'all ever heard of the Fry Guys?

36:14.400 --> 36:18.480
They defected from the Potato Kingdom.

36:18.480 --> 36:23.520
Roscoe, do you have a sidekick that we can maybe spin you and that sidekick off into

36:23.520 --> 36:26.560
like its own podcast just about Roscoe?

36:26.560 --> 36:27.760
I got Spuddy Buddy.

36:28.480 --> 36:28.960
Perfect.

36:28.960 --> 36:31.360
He's a dog.

36:31.360 --> 36:35.920
The worst part, the most dangerous part about this is that we're going to let him go on

36:35.920 --> 36:40.320
long enough that he's going to say something funny enough to include it in the actual podcast,

36:40.320 --> 36:42.560
and then we're stuck with like all the buildups.

36:42.560 --> 36:44.400
Spuddy Buddy was pretty great.

36:44.400 --> 36:45.200
I know.

36:45.200 --> 36:47.760
This is all gold, and this is all making the final cut.

36:48.400 --> 36:49.680
It's all Yukon gold.

36:51.360 --> 36:53.360
Hey, fucking watch it, buddy.

36:53.360 --> 37:00.320
Let's talk more about my body.

37:00.320 --> 37:01.440
Now, check it out.

37:01.440 --> 37:05.840
What I got here, I got a big brown potato for my hand, but what's that coming off of

37:05.840 --> 37:06.160
it?

37:06.160 --> 37:06.960
Fingerlings.

37:09.520 --> 37:11.200
I mean, that's what I would have guessed.

37:11.200 --> 37:13.600
I mean, if I had to guess, that was the guess I would have made.

37:13.600 --> 37:15.760
I'll wear a shirt made out of tinfoil.

37:18.160 --> 37:20.960
It's weird that Jake wrote all this to Grace.

37:20.960 --> 37:24.080
Yeah, it's a very special relationship.

37:24.080 --> 37:25.760
You want me to read this one?

37:25.760 --> 37:26.320
Absolutely not.

37:26.320 --> 37:27.360
Yes, I do.

37:27.360 --> 37:28.720
I can't read human English.

37:28.720 --> 37:29.760
It'll be ridiculous.

37:30.800 --> 37:32.960
I'm a collection of living potatoes.

37:36.080 --> 37:37.760
Do you guys need to know what time it is?

37:37.760 --> 37:42.720
Because I'm powering like six or seven different clocks for a science project.

37:42.720 --> 37:46.960
Dorothy and the tin man and the scarecrow like walked past Roscoe the potato man.

37:46.960 --> 37:48.960
They're like, he's like, wait, the wizard could...

37:48.960 --> 37:51.520
No, they were like, no, we're good.

37:51.520 --> 37:52.080
We're good here.

37:52.720 --> 37:53.360
You go ahead.

37:54.960 --> 37:56.960
They said, we can't fit you in the car.

37:56.960 --> 37:58.000
And I was like, what car?

37:58.000 --> 37:58.800
It's not a car.

37:59.600 --> 38:00.880
They just kept on going.

38:01.680 --> 38:05.760
I couldn't go anywhere though because I'm forever attached to the ground by a bunch of vines.

38:09.360 --> 38:11.040
I need the vines though to keep me alive.

38:12.560 --> 38:13.760
Happy birthday, Grace.

38:13.760 --> 38:19.040
Grace, we've been dating for over five years now and I know it'll only keep getting better.

38:19.040 --> 38:23.840
Thanks for loving the weird and goofy guy I am and accepting me into your heart of hearts.

38:23.840 --> 38:25.360
I love you so much.

38:25.360 --> 38:28.800
I hope you enjoy hearing the brother's sweet, sweet voices.

38:28.800 --> 38:32.000
Reading this special message just for you.

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
The love of your life, Jake.

38:34.000 --> 38:37.440
Oh, isn't that a little baked sweet potato there, isn't it?

38:37.440 --> 38:38.720
Hi, everybody.

38:38.720 --> 38:39.680
This is Jesse Thorne.

38:40.400 --> 38:41.680
I want to apologize.

38:41.680 --> 38:47.440
The last five minutes you've heard were put into the air without my permission.

38:47.440 --> 38:53.360
And I want to especially apologize to Grace and Jake who generously gave to this network in hopes

38:53.360 --> 38:57.520
of getting a promotion on their favorite podcast network, My Brother, My Brother and Me, which is

38:57.520 --> 38:59.200
a show and not a podcast network.

38:59.200 --> 39:00.880
Sorry, been day drinking.

39:00.880 --> 39:02.320
Anyway, it's Jesse Thorne here.

39:02.320 --> 39:08.880
And I just really want to apologize to Grace and Jake for the substandard quality of this

39:08.880 --> 39:16.080
Jumbotron message and also the surrounding bit, sort of a Julius Caesar's diarrhea coating

39:16.080 --> 39:20.880
on what should be a beautiful maraschino cherry of a message.

39:20.880 --> 39:25.520
So in closing, I want to add my happy birthdays to Jake's happy birthdays.

39:25.520 --> 39:29.920
And in doing so, subtract the happy birthdays of Grace, the potato boy.

39:29.920 --> 39:31.200
I didn't listen.

39:31.200 --> 39:32.560
I skipped around a little bit.

39:32.560 --> 39:33.680
Again, day drinking.

39:33.680 --> 39:38.480
Anyway, this has been Jesse Thorne reminding you to listen to all the other shows on our

39:38.480 --> 39:41.440
network, especially mine.

39:41.440 --> 39:43.280
Guess it's time for me to die now.

39:44.080 --> 39:45.680
Well, goodbye, Roscoe.

39:45.680 --> 39:47.280
Sounds like I am.

39:47.280 --> 39:50.560
Listen, Roscoe been around long enough to know when he's not wanted.

39:53.280 --> 39:57.520
I have fucking empirical evidence that that is a lie.

39:58.560 --> 40:00.560
I've been around a lot longer than you, Justin.

40:01.280 --> 40:01.920
Yeah, that's right.

40:01.920 --> 40:02.640
I know your name.

40:03.760 --> 40:06.560
I'm going to go feed myself to some hungry kids.

40:06.560 --> 40:09.040
The hard part about doing this- Oh, he's selfless, isn't he?

40:09.040 --> 40:10.800
You didn't expect that turn, did you?

40:10.800 --> 40:14.400
You didn't think he would sacrifice his life to put some food in the bellies of the working

40:14.400 --> 40:15.120
man.

40:15.120 --> 40:25.600
But here I go off to die to fill up some bellies with my own starchy belly.

40:25.600 --> 40:28.320
The hard part about doing this show in audio is he can say this.

40:28.320 --> 40:32.320
I don't know if he's actually leaving the room because the character of Roscoe, the

40:32.320 --> 40:33.360
potato kid- I'm not leaving the room.

40:33.360 --> 40:35.760
I'm hopping to a big old pot of boiling water.

40:35.760 --> 40:37.600
It's comically large, but here I go.

40:38.640 --> 40:38.880
Justin.

40:38.880 --> 40:39.600
This is it.

40:39.600 --> 40:40.800
I'm standing on the edge.

40:40.800 --> 40:41.360
Justin.

40:41.360 --> 40:42.640
Standing on the edge now.

40:43.600 --> 40:46.800
Travis, I'm not going to apologize to Roscoe.

40:46.800 --> 40:51.120
I'm just going to dip my little fingerling toes in and just test- Oh, no!

40:52.480 --> 40:53.760
Oh, that's the hot water.

40:53.760 --> 40:56.080
Justin, don't let him feed those hungry kids.

40:56.080 --> 40:57.040
It's going to feel-

40:57.040 --> 41:03.360
In the interest of saving our listeners, the sonic assault of hearing Roscoe boiled a lie.

41:03.360 --> 41:08.000
Travis, I got a request, would you mind turning my head potato 180 degrees real sharply?

41:08.800 --> 41:09.280
And so-

41:11.040 --> 41:11.680
So I can't-

41:11.680 --> 41:12.640
Will that kill you?

41:12.640 --> 41:16.640
Yeah, it'll kill me real quick, but I don't want to feel what happens next.

41:16.640 --> 41:20.400
I will do it because Justin drove me to do it.

41:20.400 --> 41:22.160
I don't want to do this, Roscoe.

41:22.160 --> 41:27.440
Okay, Justin, he's got his big, strong, ape-like fingers wrapped around my neck.

41:28.240 --> 41:28.740
So-

41:29.360 --> 41:32.400
He's got his gape-like fingers wrapped around-

41:32.400 --> 41:37.680
Listen, are we to believe that you're made of potatoes and that you have, like, a nervous system?

41:37.680 --> 41:38.880
Is that what you're saying?

41:38.880 --> 41:40.960
We've established all this, Justin.

41:40.960 --> 41:45.040
This doesn't sound like an apology, so Travis, I want you- Can you give me a countdown?

41:45.040 --> 41:46.960
I need to think about my potato chip.

41:46.960 --> 41:48.000
Where do you want me to start?

41:49.040 --> 41:49.840
Just three.

41:50.480 --> 41:52.560
Okay, three, two-

41:52.560 --> 41:53.440
Oh, I had a lot of-

41:53.440 --> 41:56.880
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Roscoe, I'm sorry.

41:56.880 --> 42:00.720
Please continue to be a fixture of our hit podcast.

42:00.720 --> 42:04.320
Our webby losing podcast, my brother, my brother and me, please.

42:04.320 --> 42:07.680
I just- I'm glad that, Travis, you've spared me because I just thought,

42:07.680 --> 42:10.320
it would be funny if I called my kids tater tots.

42:12.400 --> 42:15.200
Ty is a pedantic person.

42:15.200 --> 42:19.520
I think when he pronounces these words, it's in a very show-off-y way.

42:20.160 --> 42:20.960
Jairo.

42:20.960 --> 42:21.920
Yiro.

42:21.920 --> 42:22.880
Sacrebleu.

42:22.880 --> 42:23.920
Sacrebleu.

42:23.920 --> 42:24.880
Ayers Rock.

42:24.880 --> 42:25.520
Uluru.

42:25.520 --> 42:27.920
What you are witnessing is real.

42:27.920 --> 42:30.160
The participants are not actors.

42:30.160 --> 42:33.200
They are actual litigants with real cases.

42:33.200 --> 42:38.960
They call in via Skype to Judge John Hodgman's court, the real people's court.

42:38.960 --> 42:42.640
Now I call you to Judge John Hodgman's internet court.

42:42.640 --> 42:46.880
Find it at Maximumfun.org or wherever you download podcasts.

42:47.840 --> 42:50.720
I'm going to be a bridesmaid in a wedding coming up in a couple months.

42:50.720 --> 42:52.000
Congratulations, Justin.

42:52.000 --> 42:55.280
Thanks, and now here's a question from a listener.

42:56.000 --> 42:59.040
I'm going to be a bridesmaid in a wedding coming up in a couple of months.

42:59.040 --> 43:03.200
The bridal party has been messaging about what to do for the bachelorette party.

43:03.200 --> 43:06.880
We're considering going out to some bars and getting a hotel room downtown.

43:06.880 --> 43:10.320
The pregnant maid of honor chimed in to say she thinks that sounds great

43:10.880 --> 43:14.400
as long as we're okay sharing a hotel room with a three-week-old baby.

43:15.360 --> 43:15.840
No.

43:15.840 --> 43:20.560
She wants to bring her newborn and her daughter-in-law to the party.

43:20.560 --> 43:24.560
Bring her newborn to the bachelorette party.

43:25.200 --> 43:27.200
How do I respond?

43:27.920 --> 43:31.840
That's from Sensible in Seattle, and I literally need to think about this for a second.

43:31.840 --> 43:33.760
Okay, I thought about it and then finished.

43:34.560 --> 43:36.240
Okay, why don't you start?

43:36.240 --> 43:37.040
Okay, assuming you're Griffin.

43:37.040 --> 43:39.360
No, no, no.

43:39.360 --> 43:40.560
I thought about it and here it is.

43:40.560 --> 43:46.160
No, like I don't want to sound anti-baby or whatever, but this is a bachelorette party,

43:46.160 --> 43:49.760
and they just want to turn their, let their hair down and get fucking buck wild

43:49.760 --> 43:52.560
and forget about the, you know, the problems of the day

43:52.560 --> 43:55.760
and just want to like have the wildest party that this person's ever gonna have.

43:56.880 --> 44:01.200
And not only that, but to Griffin's point, it'd be one thing if it was just like

44:01.200 --> 44:04.080
we're getting a hotel suite and that's where the party is,

44:04.080 --> 44:09.600
but if you're talking about also like bar hopping and ending up at a hotel room downtown,

44:10.640 --> 44:12.800
that child should not be with you.

44:13.600 --> 44:15.280
I don't want to sound like a dick because I get it.

44:15.280 --> 44:17.680
Like it's hard, it's hard planning around this stuff, but like

44:17.680 --> 44:20.800
this is, that seems like a weirdly passive aggressive like,

44:20.800 --> 44:22.000
oh, you're trying to party, huh?

44:22.000 --> 44:24.400
Trying to have like the biggest and best party of your life.

44:24.400 --> 44:27.040
You're like having a party that you want other people to plan

44:27.040 --> 44:30.320
so you can tell stories about it and be surprised by like how wild it got, huh?

44:30.320 --> 44:31.280
Okay, cool.

44:31.280 --> 44:37.520
Well, here's like a three week old baby that's like probably gonna keep,

44:37.520 --> 44:39.520
keep things from getting too buck wild.

44:39.520 --> 44:45.520
Like I don't want a bunch of like fucking hot dicks slapping against hips in here

44:45.520 --> 44:49.680
because I got this baby, this one here, 21 days old.

44:49.680 --> 44:50.400
Check it out.

44:50.400 --> 44:50.880
Unless.

44:52.000 --> 44:53.360
No, there's not an unless for that.

44:54.320 --> 44:55.920
What if the baby can hang?

44:55.920 --> 44:59.840
Generally speaking, it's probably too early to have your baby out and about.

44:59.840 --> 45:02.720
I mean, you could use a safety angle like that, right?

45:02.720 --> 45:07.520
Like really, a three week old baby should not be, you know, out and about.

45:07.520 --> 45:10.720
Their little dumb nervous systems haven't even heard about anything yet.

45:10.720 --> 45:10.960
Yeah.

45:10.960 --> 45:15.760
So they're like so, not their nervous system, sorry, their little dumb immune systems,

45:15.760 --> 45:17.360
like haven't heard about anything yet.

45:17.360 --> 45:20.560
And their nervous systems, if their nervous systems are exposed to some like

45:20.560 --> 45:25.440
fucking full blown magic mic XXXXXL hanging brain,

45:25.440 --> 45:27.440
they're not gonna, they're gonna see that and be like,

45:27.440 --> 45:32.880
I haven't, don't really have the nerves to like really process these yet.

45:32.880 --> 45:33.120
Interesting.

45:33.120 --> 45:34.880
Is this, Justin, you are a father.

45:35.520 --> 45:39.360
Is this a scenario in which this person,

45:39.360 --> 45:42.400
you know, having a child that's only three weeks old,

45:43.040 --> 45:48.480
they have not yet acclimated to the fact that they don't get to do

45:48.480 --> 45:51.920
as much stuff as they did before they had a baby?

45:51.920 --> 45:55.760
Hey, I'm gonna tell it, I'm gonna teach everybody,

45:56.400 --> 46:01.200
Bill Cosby's out, so you need a new fatherhood kind of guy and it's me.

46:01.200 --> 46:04.240
So here's my first funny observation about what you learn as a dad.

46:04.240 --> 46:08.640
Rule number one and only rule, don't fucking tell moms what to do ever.

46:08.640 --> 46:11.040
Let's, I love babies.

46:11.040 --> 46:12.720
I love them dearly.

46:12.720 --> 46:16.560
My friends here in town having babies, I love being around those babies,

46:16.560 --> 46:20.640
but I get this feeling when I'm around a baby and it's the same feeling I get,

46:20.640 --> 46:22.480
and this is gonna be weird, but hang with me,

46:22.480 --> 46:25.680
whenever I go to like, and not that I go to these often,

46:25.680 --> 46:31.280
but like a gun range where it's one false move around this thing

46:31.280 --> 46:35.920
and that's it for my, like my life is ruined.

46:35.920 --> 46:38.720
And it's hard for me to really let my hair down.

46:38.720 --> 46:42.880
It's hard to get blitzkrieg'd when you know like,

46:42.880 --> 46:46.560
there's a thing in this room that if I goof around too much with,

46:47.200 --> 46:48.720
that's the ball game.

46:48.720 --> 46:50.960
Yeah, that's, yeah, fiend.

46:50.960 --> 46:52.400
Fiend on the whole thing.

46:52.400 --> 46:55.120
That's a wrap, that's a wrap on Griffin.

46:55.120 --> 46:56.080
Do you know what I mean?

46:56.080 --> 46:58.960
He's had a good, hey everybody, that's a wrap.

46:58.960 --> 46:59.520
At a gun range,

46:59.520 --> 47:02.720
It's a series wrap on Griffin, let's have a big round of applause.

47:02.720 --> 47:06.000
At a gun range, I don't think like, I'm pretty confident

47:06.000 --> 47:08.960
that there's not gonna be a fateful whoopsie,

47:09.600 --> 47:12.640
but the fact that the thing that is there

47:12.640 --> 47:17.520
could cause a fateful whoopsie, a career ending whoopsie doodle,

47:18.400 --> 47:20.000
and I feel that same way around babies,

47:20.000 --> 47:21.120
and it's hard for me to like,

47:21.120 --> 47:23.840
there's always that reserve in the back of my mind of like,

47:23.840 --> 47:26.720
you need to keep one part of your consciousness

47:26.720 --> 47:29.360
just dedicated to the survival of that.

47:30.240 --> 47:32.560
I think the bigger issue that you're still gonna run into

47:32.560 --> 47:34.000
is that this maid of honor

47:34.560 --> 47:37.760
has not accepted the reality of being a parent,

47:37.760 --> 47:38.880
and what that means is like,

47:40.000 --> 47:43.040
it, one of like, the thing,

47:43.040 --> 47:44.720
like there's so much good about it,

47:44.720 --> 47:47.360
and the one thing that is definitely true

47:47.360 --> 47:50.160
is that you are about to not be able to say yes

47:50.160 --> 47:51.920
to whatever you want to say yes to.

47:51.920 --> 47:54.800
Like, there are going to be things that just fucking suck

47:54.800 --> 47:56.960
because you can't go to them, and it blows,

47:56.960 --> 47:59.040
but that's it, like that's the thing.

47:59.040 --> 48:00.800
Like, that's the, that's the treatment you're getting.

48:00.800 --> 48:05.120
Unless, unless have you guys

48:06.320 --> 48:09.200
seen the Bruce Willis movie Surrogates?

48:10.720 --> 48:11.200
Uh-huh.

48:12.960 --> 48:14.720
I saw the Spanish language version

48:14.720 --> 48:16.480
that I bought in Honduras.

48:16.480 --> 48:21.040
It was actually an off-screen camera version

48:21.040 --> 48:23.520
that I bought for $3 outside of the grocery store.

48:23.520 --> 48:24.560
A Super Marque, though.

48:25.520 --> 48:26.400
So you get it.

48:27.440 --> 48:27.920
I get it.

48:27.920 --> 48:30.240
I haven't, I haven't seen it, but I think it's about like,

48:30.240 --> 48:32.560
you climb, they, like you can control people

48:32.560 --> 48:34.880
while you're not, it's like,

48:34.880 --> 48:38.000
I think the plot of the movie Surrogates is Bruce Willis

48:38.800 --> 48:41.360
is in a, like some sort of chamber,

48:41.360 --> 48:44.240
and he controls like a fake version of himself,

48:44.240 --> 48:45.280
which I know you're wondering, like,

48:45.280 --> 48:47.600
if I was controlling an artificial Bruce Willis,

48:47.600 --> 48:50.480
I would just like, just jerk myself off like constant,

48:50.480 --> 48:53.280
like nonstop, like 24-7, but I, this doesn't,

48:54.160 --> 48:55.760
I haven't seen the movie Surrogates,

48:55.760 --> 48:58.560
I haven't seen the movie Surrogates, but I,

48:58.560 --> 48:59.840
Maybe for your bachelorette party,

48:59.840 --> 49:02.080
just rent and watch the movie Surrogates.

49:02.080 --> 49:03.280
Surrogates, yeah, could be one option.

49:03.280 --> 49:04.560
That would be pretty good.

49:04.560 --> 49:05.680
You could do also one of those things

49:05.680 --> 49:07.680
where it's like an iPad rolling around on wheels,

49:08.720 --> 49:10.160
but I think the Surrogates-

49:10.160 --> 49:11.280
Of the movie Surrogate?

49:12.560 --> 49:13.060
Yes.

49:14.640 --> 49:16.240
This is my dear friend, Jennifer.

49:16.240 --> 49:18.320
We've been friends since we were kids,

49:18.320 --> 49:20.640
and she is my beautiful maid of honor.

49:20.640 --> 49:23.280
That looks like an iPad with the movie Surrogates on it,

49:23.280 --> 49:26.720
rolling around on a remote-controlled car.

49:26.720 --> 49:27.680
Yeah, exactly.

49:27.680 --> 49:28.800
I love you, Jennifer.

49:28.800 --> 49:30.480
Jennifer, do you remember that time that,

49:30.480 --> 49:32.000
yeah, that was, yeah, that was it.

49:33.840 --> 49:36.160
That's just a scene of Bruce Willis jerking himself off.

49:36.160 --> 49:36.720
Yeah, I know.

49:37.520 --> 49:39.440
It's my favorite Jennifer trait.

49:40.080 --> 49:41.840
It's my favorite quality of Jennifers.

49:41.840 --> 49:44.720
What if you ever hire a male stripper dressed like Super Nanny?

49:46.640 --> 49:49.760
And he's also very good at taking care of babies,

49:49.760 --> 49:52.240
so after he's done with his thing,

49:52.240 --> 49:55.440
he gets dressed back up, maybe in some comfortable sweats,

49:55.440 --> 49:57.200
and he takes care of the baby.

49:57.200 --> 49:58.560
This is good for everybody.

49:58.560 --> 49:59.040
But you need-

49:59.040 --> 50:00.320
Who's gonna be taking care of the baby

50:00.320 --> 50:02.960
while he's doing his work up there,

50:02.960 --> 50:04.320
while he's slapping his-

50:04.960 --> 50:06.240
I mean, they do take naps.

50:06.800 --> 50:07.760
The babies do take naps.

50:07.760 --> 50:09.200
Oh, I thought you meant male strippers.

50:10.080 --> 50:10.800
What?

50:10.800 --> 50:12.480
Male strippers take naps.

50:12.480 --> 50:14.400
They probably get worn out afterwards,

50:14.400 --> 50:15.760
plopping that dong around.

50:15.760 --> 50:16.800
It's exhausting.

50:16.800 --> 50:18.960
I have never seen a male stripper do a thing,

50:18.960 --> 50:21.040
and it's not from any closed-mindedness of myself.

50:21.040 --> 50:22.800
I've just never been afforded the opportunity.

50:23.680 --> 50:26.080
But in my mind, and based on just sort of the conversation

50:26.080 --> 50:29.280
and the open, free dialogue that the three of us have had today,

50:29.840 --> 50:33.120
it sounds like we all assume that they just kind of get up there,

50:33.920 --> 50:35.120
they just kind of get up there,

50:35.680 --> 50:40.160
and then they just kind of do a left-to-right situation.

50:40.160 --> 50:43.600
Whap, whap, whap, whap, whap, whap, whap, whap, whap.

50:43.600 --> 50:44.640
As if they were-

50:44.640 --> 50:45.680
Until they get tired.

50:46.480 --> 50:49.440
And then they take a nap.

50:49.780 --> 50:52.620
There's a quick fiver and then they're back to taking care of your baby

50:53.280 --> 50:55.280
I guess it makes sense. I

50:55.800 --> 51:01.340
Want to just I want to put a button in something because I don't think this has been particularly hysterical

51:01.340 --> 51:03.560
but it is like it's a tough one and

51:04.400 --> 51:08.840
I I think that the same rule would apply if you were the baby's father as well

51:08.840 --> 51:11.900
I would hope that's like yeah, it's like you just it's like

51:12.400 --> 51:14.000
it's it's

51:14.000 --> 51:20.840
There's so much good about parenthood and and and I think one of like the the scariest hardest to accept things is also like

51:21.060 --> 51:23.060
one of the most

51:23.960 --> 51:29.860
beautiful things about it is that you are saying like I'm not the center of the universe anymore and it's like and it's very

51:29.860 --> 51:35.640
Hard because what you end up doing when that happens is like putting a lot of other people who you would have

51:35.880 --> 51:42.620
sacrificed for before like including, you know doing things that you really want to do like and are very important to you like

51:42.620 --> 51:47.000
Can't just can't happen and like that's the that's that's the way of it

51:47.000 --> 51:51.860
And it's it's ultimately really rewarding but it's just like that's not the way it works

51:51.860 --> 51:58.780
Anyway, you can't just do whatever you want. By the way that whole bit where we took on a question like dealing with like fucking

52:00.540 --> 52:08.360
Motherhood and how to handle like etiquette at a bachelorette party that we were so qualified to talk about that whole thing was April Fool's joke

52:08.360 --> 52:15.060
So just can't believe you fell for it. Just kind of covering up thought that we were really talking some shit out of our asses about

52:15.780 --> 52:22.140
Travis put this question on here. We had fell into a beautiful traffic Travis. Was this your elaborate Gabriel fools joke?

52:22.140 --> 52:28.140
I can't believe you fell for it you fools you you goofus is your real gapers or the gapers now

52:29.020 --> 52:32.300
Look to your left. Look to your right if someone's not gaping

52:32.300 --> 52:38.660
You're the gaper if you ran into a gaper today. They're the gaper if all you run into is gapers. You're the gaper

52:39.540 --> 52:43.860
Hey, let's do it. Let's talk about something that we're even remotely qualified to talk about let's do yahoo

52:44.620 --> 52:46.620
Okay, this guy who was sent in by

52:47.140 --> 52:52.020
Riding high so we can see you. Thank you. So it's by yahoo answers user Gary the human being

52:52.820 --> 52:54.100
well

52:54.100 --> 52:56.460
Who I'm working a little hard there Gare

52:56.460 --> 53:03.980
Yeah, this is like the easiest turning test ever our ghosts stuck with whatever haircut and outfit

53:03.980 --> 53:08.260
They had when they died or can they customize their look and gear?

53:09.540 --> 53:10.700
Hmm

53:10.700 --> 53:16.540
For just 500 Nintendo coins they can get a new hat. Yeah, it'll be

53:17.300 --> 53:22.600
The trick is you got to find the neighborhood. You gotta find the barber in the town. It's usually right next to the safe place

53:22.600 --> 53:27.240
You got to kill you got a haunt and kill a barber and be like, ah sick. I'm so glad you're here

53:27.240 --> 53:32.800
I was thinking about like doing like a size six guard on the sides and then scissor cutting and thinning out on top

53:32.800 --> 53:39.500
So get to it. And if you find the ghost magazine spread throughout the wasteland you can get new tattoos. Hey, I saw

53:40.720 --> 53:42.600
The specter of death

53:42.600 --> 53:48.200
Today and he was like the only way to be set free from this ghost prison is to give Jerry a haircut

53:48.200 --> 53:54.700
So let's what do you say? Let's hop on it. You have to though, right because otherwise every like

53:55.320 --> 54:00.600
Discovery history channel show the person would be like, I'm there at the top of the stairs

54:01.240 --> 54:05.380
With somebody in like a pretty sweet like they had like a faux hawk

54:05.520 --> 54:08.880
It was pretty great and they had on just the coolest t-shirt

54:08.880 --> 54:13.120
It's a graphic tee and they were like I died here 200 years ago

54:13.120 --> 54:20.280
Yeah, somebody is like as a joke in 2016. They're like cleaning out their closet and they're like guys check it

54:20.280 --> 54:24.680
I found this hyper color t-shirt. I found these fucking goggles that I bought from Hot Topic and guys

54:25.360 --> 54:30.380
Jinko jean skirt this shit is oh shit slip. Click. Click. Click. Click. Oh, no

54:32.440 --> 54:36.360
What if you're what if you're what if you are at a fucking

54:36.840 --> 54:42.640
You're in a toilet situation and you have your pants pulled down on your ankles because you just want to feel free and you pee

54:42.640 --> 54:50.360
And then like a sudden immediate coronary dead and then it's like, oh no, I'm like my dick is up forever. No

54:51.360 --> 54:57.800
You have the number one evidence that I have that ghosts are allowed to change their clothes is you think about how many people?

54:58.160 --> 55:02.040
Over the history must have died while pretending to be Santa Claus

55:02.320 --> 55:07.920
Yeah, you don't see a lot of Santa ghosts roaming around right like they're allowed to change their clothes

55:07.920 --> 55:14.520
Mm when it's suck if like how it worked is when you became a ghost you just automatically were in the clothes that you are

55:14.520 --> 55:19.720
Most identified with as a human being like that's why like you see them in like Civil War

55:20.240 --> 55:22.360
Uniforms and stuff even if they died in their long john

55:22.360 --> 55:28.120
So then you die and you come back and you're like him the ugliest dress shirt you ever owned and you're like is this what?

55:28.120 --> 55:34.560
Everyone thinks of me. Is this you don't remember that cool jean jacket. I had this is how I'm gonna be remembered forever

55:34.560 --> 55:39.440
What if it or what if it's during your fucking jean jacket phase and it was like this is when you were happiest in your

55:39.440 --> 55:44.280
Life, but this is when you were most free is when you got that jean jacket if you can change your clothes

55:44.680 --> 55:48.840
But you can only do it once every 25 years

55:48.840 --> 55:49.920
Oh my god

55:49.920 --> 55:56.520
Cuz then you like have to pick whatever style you think is gonna continue to be relevant and then everybody's easy like damn Daniel

55:57.560 --> 56:00.080
Daniel still at it again with the white pants

56:00.080 --> 56:07.760
What if the only way you got to change clothes is it by convincing living beings to destroy their clothes?

56:07.760 --> 56:09.760
So you could get new ghost

56:15.800 --> 56:18.680
Please burn those pants. I love those pants. Please bring them

56:18.680 --> 56:25.240
It's like the actually the number one sort of writing tip that I've gotten that has made it so helpful for me to craft my fiction

56:25.240 --> 56:29.480
Is just kill your jinkos, you know, there's no sacred calves here

56:29.480 --> 56:31.160
Just kill those jinkos Justin

56:31.160 --> 56:39.120
I really liked your idea of 25 years a change because you die in 1971 and you're wearing some dumb goofy 71 shit

56:39.120 --> 56:44.480
And then it's 1996 and you're like, oh, thank god. I've been waiting for this definitely jinkos

56:47.000 --> 56:51.200
But I'm thinking about I I had my dad kill a Gameboy pocket the other day and

56:51.400 --> 56:57.440
I'm gonna be able to definitely carry like maybe two or three of those bad boys in these jinkos and this is a look everlasting

56:57.440 --> 56:59.440
so and then it's fucking what what's

57:00.080 --> 57:04.800
1996 was 25 and one 2021 and what it'll be there like

57:05.640 --> 57:06.960
What's again?

57:06.960 --> 57:09.840
Jinkos? Yeah, it's all it comes back around times

57:10.360 --> 57:13.920
Times a flat circle and it fits in a jinko, you know, it'd be great

57:13.920 --> 57:20.160
This is probably why you see the every ghost is in old-timey clothes because they went through like three cycles of this and they're like fuck

57:20.160 --> 57:21.440
I'm just gonna do

57:21.440 --> 57:25.480
Fucking suit like what am I what am I even trying to I can't predict this shit

57:25.480 --> 57:28.440
I couldn't predict it when I was alive. Why the fuck did I predict it now?

57:28.440 --> 57:31.560
But and then you put on the suit and it's like this is you're good for 25 years, right?

57:31.560 --> 57:35.680
It's like yeah, and then you look down and your boxers are caught in your zipper

57:37.640 --> 57:39.640
That's the worst part of being

57:40.200 --> 57:45.920
The editor of vogue is that you're haunted by a lot of unfashionable ghosts who are like hey, hey

57:45.920 --> 57:48.820
Hey, hey, say hyper colors back in put it

57:49.560 --> 57:53.140
Say it's high again. Say it's hyper colors hot again. Say it

57:53.140 --> 57:55.700
You know coming back pump shoes

57:56.540 --> 57:58.580
Put the Reebok pumps are back

57:59.420 --> 58:01.780
Wouldn't you like to go to the ghost clothing store?

58:01.860 --> 58:06.840
Well, like the guys finds that they're like, did you want to take this out or should we kill it for you here?

58:07.660 --> 58:12.220
This this poll looks fantastic on you. Did you want us to burn it in front of you or oh

58:14.180 --> 58:16.340
All right, that's gonna bag

58:18.420 --> 58:19.820
I

58:19.820 --> 58:25.720
Think that's gonna be the end of the podcast because it's time for another episode of shower bros

58:25.820 --> 58:31.340
