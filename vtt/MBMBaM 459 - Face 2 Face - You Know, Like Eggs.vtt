00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:44.560
It's a new craze, and good girls do you want it? Just say, hey, I wanna. Just say, hey, I wanna.

00:44.560 --> 00:47.040
Welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me, and the Advice Show for the modern era. I'm your

00:47.040 --> 00:56.160
oldest brother Justin McElroy. Hey, we're Q. Are the house lights on? Because it seems like I could

00:56.160 --> 01:02.080
sit. There we go. Little distracting. I'm your middle-aged brother, Travis McElroy.

01:06.160 --> 01:10.880
It actually hurts a little bit. Like, it's so loud, it's like being next to a jet engine.

01:10.880 --> 01:14.080
I'm your sweet baby brother and 30 under 30 media luminary, Griffin McElroy.

01:17.120 --> 01:23.360
These facilities are built to make sure the sound is great, going from the violins and shit

01:23.360 --> 01:27.440
to you, and they don't really count on people to be like, help, yeah, fuck yeah.

01:29.040 --> 01:39.040
Madden butterflies my shit. This is an advice show. We have been in your beautiful city for all

01:40.720 --> 01:48.880
seven hours. We flew in, and it is astounding. I think it's the right word.

01:48.880 --> 01:56.720
Beautiful. The vistas. It looks like you are in a fairy village nestled inside of a remote

01:56.720 --> 02:04.080
mountain kingdom. It was like flying into the shire. Yeah, and then. I said in the van ride

02:04.080 --> 02:08.480
from the airport to the hotel, and it fucking slayed, so I'm really excited I dropped this on

02:08.480 --> 02:19.280
you. Hey, more like Salt Lake pretty. Yeah, very good. Thanks. So I'm like blown away

02:19.280 --> 02:24.880
driving through your amazing city, blown away at these vistas, and then I walked a half mile

02:24.880 --> 02:34.560
to get four percent beer, and are you all okay? Because you can tell us if you're not okay.

02:34.560 --> 02:41.520
Everyone blink twice if you're not okay. You can come with us. There's room in the car.

02:44.960 --> 02:49.680
I hate to be the one to break it to y'all, but there's stronger beer other places.

02:51.120 --> 02:55.920
I think that maybe it's not a great fit because yesterday. Wouldn't you love to be

02:55.920 --> 02:58.960
partying with someone who's traveled in from Salt Lake City? They're like,

02:58.960 --> 03:07.040
oh, what's wrong with you? I had two beers. Losing it. We were trying to figure out what to do. We

03:07.040 --> 03:12.080
have some time to spend tomorrow in your beautiful city, and I was like, there's the big cottonwood

03:12.080 --> 03:18.880
cannon looks really, did I say cannon? It looks sweet. It looks like great hiking, and I was

03:18.880 --> 03:23.440
saying that out loud, not realizing just what a tough sell that was going to be for the McElroy

03:23.440 --> 03:31.520
family. I was looking at it like, and you just walk up it. Keeping in mind that this is like

03:31.520 --> 03:35.920
when we're looking for a restaurant, if it took a 10 minute walk, we're like, oh, I don't know.

03:35.920 --> 03:42.400
I don't know. Maybe we should rub hub it. Justin literally said, do you, is there like a store to

03:42.400 --> 03:51.280
buy something when you get there? We're all having a lot of fun. It was a good time. It's a good

03:51.280 --> 04:00.000
place. Thank you for having us. Thank you for the warm reception. Holy crap. Would you all like to,

04:00.000 --> 04:05.040
oh, we're going to do some of our twisted skewed jokes up here for a bit, and then we're going to

04:05.040 --> 04:08.880
do audience questions that you all have sent in ahead of time. Thank you all so much for doing

04:08.880 --> 04:16.320
that. It may be kind of tricky because this is just a big square of humans. The whole audience

04:16.320 --> 04:23.360
is one solid person. Yes. But again, if you come to see Lobo M, you're not like halfway through

04:23.360 --> 04:27.360
like, ah, I've fucking seen this before. I'm out. You're also not like, I'm going to ask them how

04:27.360 --> 04:32.720
it's going to end. I'm going to make a sneaky exit. Yeah. So anyway, it's an advice show. Yes,

04:32.720 --> 04:41.440
but I'd like to open with a yahoo from the yahoo answers. Okay. Riddle me piss. Okay.

04:41.440 --> 04:51.600
Okay. So unprecedented, unprecedented. I've now been interrupted doing a yahoo from both brothers

04:51.600 --> 05:00.960
now for their great segments. And it's really, you're starting with this. All right. This one

05:00.960 --> 05:14.400
not from riddles.com, but from riddles.fyi. Okay. Now this is a real brain teaser. Yeah.

05:16.400 --> 05:19.840
I love him. I love his great voice and how long he makes it last.

05:19.840 --> 05:24.320
Look how the riddle master has devolved into Minnie Ripperson. I'm really enjoying that.

05:24.320 --> 05:34.400
What has wings, but cannot fly. Legs, but cannot walk. And eyes, but cannot see.

05:35.760 --> 05:39.040
A potato. The last part is a potato.

05:39.040 --> 05:42.960
The last is a potato. Would you like to hear it one more time?

05:42.960 --> 05:55.600
Not really. What has wings, but cannot fly. Legs, but cannot walk.

05:55.600 --> 05:59.440
I legit think I know the answer. And eyes, but cannot see. Griffin.

05:59.440 --> 06:02.640
I'm going to say a penguin, a chair, and a potato.

06:07.680 --> 06:10.080
What was the last one? Eyes, but cannot see.

06:10.080 --> 06:14.400
And the first one was wings, but cannot fly. Is it a buffalo, wild wings?

06:16.800 --> 06:22.160
A good guess. But no, I will read it to you one more time.

06:24.000 --> 06:28.640
I would also like you to remember that on riddles.fyi, you can see how many times someone

06:28.640 --> 06:32.880
shared it. So remember five different people at least looked at this and said,

06:32.880 --> 06:38.720
oh hell yeah, I'm going to share that. I imagine it's about to go up precipitously.

06:38.720 --> 06:42.880
What has wings, but cannot fly. Legs, but cannot walk.

06:42.880 --> 06:45.600
And eyes, but cannot see. A dead bird.

06:51.600 --> 06:54.960
It's rough. He's not wrong.

06:57.040 --> 07:02.480
I didn't write it. Although I do think it opens up a whole new realm of riddle of like,

07:02.480 --> 07:05.840
what looks like a dog, but can't bark? A dead dog.

07:05.840 --> 07:09.120
Yeah, sure. Good. Good.

07:09.120 --> 07:12.720
So here's a Yahoo that was sent in by Graham Roebuck. Thank you, Graham.

07:12.720 --> 07:16.240
It is Yahoo Answers user. The internet doesn't work on the stage.

07:16.240 --> 07:20.160
So I'm going to say a Bilbo asks,

07:22.880 --> 07:24.880
is a restaurant a store?

07:28.320 --> 07:34.240
Technically speaking. Update. Okay. Well, to clear things up,

07:34.240 --> 07:38.000
whenever my family is going to Olive Garden, we say, I'm going to the store.

07:40.720 --> 07:43.120
Why on earth? To who?

07:44.640 --> 07:48.880
Well, I said this the other day and my friend looked at me weird when I said that I was excited

07:48.880 --> 07:56.080
to eat the breadsticks. I think that technically a restaurant, because they have stock,

07:56.080 --> 08:00.560
parentheses, food, and you give them money, parentheses, dollars.

08:00.560 --> 08:06.080
Oh, I see.

08:06.880 --> 08:08.560
Not coal mining script then.

08:12.240 --> 08:16.560
I mean, no, no, no. Yeah, well.

08:16.560 --> 08:17.840
Yeah, actually.

08:17.840 --> 08:23.360
But I guess I stand by my question because how often does it come up that you're like,

08:23.360 --> 08:27.440
hey, I got to go to the store. And it's like, why are you telling me that?

08:27.440 --> 08:31.360
It's like, well, cause I'm leaving to go to Olive Garden with my, like, how often do you

08:31.360 --> 08:36.080
call Olive Garden the store? Apparently this person every Sunday after church.

08:38.560 --> 08:42.560
The only reason you would do that is if you didn't want them to go to Olive Garden with you.

08:42.560 --> 08:43.760
Yeah. I see.

08:43.760 --> 08:46.320
You're trying to dissuade them from tagging along.

08:47.920 --> 08:51.040
I'm just going to the store with my family to have infinite soup, salad, and breadsticks.

08:51.040 --> 08:51.920
I mean, oh no.

08:51.920 --> 08:56.960
But then I think it's unlimited, not infinite.

09:01.280 --> 09:05.360
Listen, I'm looking into the void.

09:05.360 --> 09:11.680
It's just, it's one long breadstick that is a ray without a terminus point.

09:13.200 --> 09:17.920
We don't know where the minestrone comes from. We open a valve and it just pours out.

09:17.920 --> 09:24.080
Um, you could do your grocery shopping at Olive Garden.

09:24.880 --> 09:28.400
You go in, you get a bunch of Andes mints.

09:28.400 --> 09:28.800
Yeah.

09:28.800 --> 09:30.560
You buy a bottle of the dressing.

09:31.360 --> 09:35.280
You buy, like, see if they'll put a bunch of sauce in a vat for you.

09:36.160 --> 09:38.160
You get a bunch of the noodles.

09:38.160 --> 09:40.960
You can even snack on some of the dry ones in the containers.

09:40.960 --> 09:41.840
Yeah, if you wanted to.

09:43.920 --> 09:46.480
You can even snack on some of those on the way home.

09:46.480 --> 09:47.840
Yeah, if you needed to.

09:47.840 --> 09:51.040
If you were told to, yeah, you probably would.

09:52.560 --> 09:56.080
I feel like there's, like, if I were going to look for, like,

09:56.080 --> 09:59.040
what is a restaurant most like, I wouldn't say a store.

09:59.040 --> 10:00.560
I would say it's like a food vacation.

10:00.560 --> 10:02.080
Oh, I like that.

10:02.080 --> 10:02.640
Do tell.

10:02.640 --> 10:04.720
Because you get all the fun parts.

10:04.720 --> 10:06.080
Princey's eating.

10:06.080 --> 10:06.320
Yeah.

10:07.920 --> 10:10.720
Without, like, having to cook it or do dishes or whatever.

10:10.720 --> 10:15.920
So you'd say, like, I'm going on vacation to eat the breadstick.

10:15.920 --> 10:18.400
Yeah, I don't think you could.

10:18.400 --> 10:21.600
I mean, you can say a lot of things, pretty much anything if you want.

10:22.400 --> 10:25.600
Yeah, you could call it an interactive snack museum if you wanted to.

10:27.920 --> 10:30.320
I'm going to the Italian Heritage Celebration.

10:34.480 --> 10:38.560
It's a festival that starts whenever I go in Olive Garden.

10:40.800 --> 10:42.720
Travis, do you mind if I move your mic up a little bit?

10:42.720 --> 10:44.080
I'm not getting the full experience.

10:45.040 --> 10:45.760
There it is.

10:45.760 --> 10:47.440
I really want to taste those plosives.

10:49.280 --> 10:50.880
They have plosives there now.

10:51.600 --> 10:54.560
Plosives of Zeppole is one of the new desserts at Olive Garden.

10:55.360 --> 10:58.080
A waiter just comes up and opens your mouth and goes,

11:02.080 --> 11:05.200
This is actually a wonderful dovetail into this first question.

11:07.440 --> 11:10.240
I am a chef at a casual fine dining restaurant.

11:10.240 --> 11:12.880
It is a pretty good job, but it's a lot of work.

11:12.880 --> 11:20.640
How can I continue to be a chef, but do less work, or even no work?

11:23.040 --> 11:27.120
The restaurant is at a ski lodge, and all the employees live in the building.

11:27.120 --> 11:28.720
If that helps, it doesn't.

11:30.560 --> 11:34.080
And that's from Sam, who isn't even trying to cloak their shit.

11:36.080 --> 11:36.960
Sam, are you here?

11:36.960 --> 11:40.400
All right.

11:40.400 --> 11:41.840
Got the night off, huh, Sam?

11:44.080 --> 11:50.000
Sam, might I make a suggestion for a new hire, a new sous chef?

11:50.000 --> 11:50.640
Grub Pub.

11:52.000 --> 11:52.640
I love this.

11:52.640 --> 11:53.600
Interesting.

11:53.600 --> 11:54.000
Yes.

11:54.000 --> 11:54.720
How would that work?

11:55.280 --> 11:57.360
Basically, it's like, what would you like, a hamburger?

11:57.360 --> 11:58.560
Okay, cool.

11:58.560 --> 12:00.720
And then you pull out an iPad and you order it and say,

12:00.720 --> 12:02.880
I think it'll be here in like, I don't know, 30 minutes.

12:04.160 --> 12:05.840
I need your credit card information.

12:05.840 --> 12:06.960
Here's what you do.

12:06.960 --> 12:10.880
You get the iPad, and where it says Grub Hub, you tape over it,

12:10.880 --> 12:12.480
and it says restaurant menu.

12:13.760 --> 12:16.880
Or menu for restaurant, if it's a really fancy place.

12:17.840 --> 12:21.360
And then you just say like, here's our menu, we have everything,

12:21.360 --> 12:26.480
and it'll be here soon, and at different times.

12:26.480 --> 12:29.600
And it bags, and sometimes not all of it.

12:29.600 --> 12:33.040
In fact, almost every time, not all of it.

12:33.040 --> 12:36.560
And don't order a drink, because the ice will be melted.

12:36.560 --> 12:37.040
Yeah.

12:37.040 --> 12:40.320
It says here you do awesome blossom and blooming onions.

12:40.320 --> 12:41.840
So, fuck yeah, we do.

12:43.280 --> 12:45.040
Like I said, it's a cool restaurant.

12:45.040 --> 12:45.360
Yeah.

12:45.360 --> 12:48.080
You could also change the hours of your restaurant to be like,

12:48.080 --> 12:53.440
you're only open from like, 2 a.m. to 6 a.m. and like, 3 p.m. to 3.30 p.m.

12:53.440 --> 12:53.840
Yeah.

12:53.840 --> 12:57.760
And then close, and then you won't have to work ever again.

12:57.760 --> 12:58.240
Yeah.

12:58.240 --> 12:59.760
Your restaurant will have shuttered.

12:59.760 --> 13:03.920
You could reach sort of like, Jiro's status from Jiro James of Sushi,

13:03.920 --> 13:08.000
and turn your restaurant into just one counter with six chairs in it.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.440
And you're like, yeah, that's right.

13:09.440 --> 13:11.920
It's me, Sam, I'm so good.

13:11.920 --> 13:13.840
Would you like the awesome blossom?

13:14.560 --> 13:18.560
Maybe you saw it on Netflix's new, good cooking show.

13:19.280 --> 13:20.400
No rules, just right.

13:20.400 --> 13:21.840
No rules, just right.

13:22.800 --> 13:26.320
There's a donut store in Cincinnati where I live,

13:26.320 --> 13:28.160
where every morning before they open,

13:28.160 --> 13:30.480
they make a fixed amount of donuts.

13:30.480 --> 13:33.360
And then when they have sold all the donuts, they close.

13:33.360 --> 13:33.760
Yeah.

13:33.760 --> 13:37.280
Which is, as far as I know, a bad business model.

13:37.280 --> 13:37.840
Yeah.

13:37.840 --> 13:41.040
Because it means that supply and demand,

13:41.040 --> 13:44.560
demand was high and supply was not enough.

13:44.560 --> 13:45.120
Well, you could-

13:45.120 --> 13:46.640
And I'm pretty sure that's bad business.

13:46.640 --> 13:50.240
The alternative though, to what you just described, Travis,

13:50.240 --> 13:53.680
is that one, they end the day with a lot of donuts they throw in the trash,

13:53.680 --> 13:56.560
or two, they stay open when they're out of donuts.

13:56.560 --> 13:58.320
They stay open when they're out of donuts.

13:59.200 --> 14:01.120
That seems ridiculous.

14:01.120 --> 14:01.760
I don't know why.

14:01.760 --> 14:03.840
They just take IOUs for the next day.

14:04.960 --> 14:07.760
Are there shortcuts you could take with your mise en place

14:08.880 --> 14:14.800
that you could just sort of convince the diner is cool and right?

14:16.160 --> 14:20.000
I'm thinking you serve your dish to the diner and you say,

14:20.000 --> 14:22.880
oh, fish bones are super in right now.

14:23.520 --> 14:24.320
It's rustic.

14:24.320 --> 14:25.040
It's rustic.

14:25.040 --> 14:26.800
We just leave them bones right.

14:26.800 --> 14:30.000
Oh, you wanted your trout cooked at all?

14:30.000 --> 14:30.960
Okay, caveman.

14:32.080 --> 14:34.400
This is kind of my take on a salad.

14:34.400 --> 14:35.680
It's a bit deconstructed.

14:35.680 --> 14:37.600
It's a head of lettuce and a whole tomato.

14:39.600 --> 14:40.800
It's in a Kroger bag.

14:40.800 --> 14:42.400
You're still eating sauce?

14:46.160 --> 14:48.960
We're kind of casual acquaintances with Chef Mike.

14:49.920 --> 14:51.440
He's a chef for McDonald's.

14:51.440 --> 14:55.520
And I don't know why Mike started tweeting at me specifically.

14:56.800 --> 14:59.120
Yeah, I can't fucking imagine, man.

14:59.120 --> 15:03.920
But you could do like Chef Mike does and just like make something once and be like,

15:03.920 --> 15:04.640
mmm, good.

15:04.640 --> 15:06.560
Everybody make it just like that from now on.

15:07.120 --> 15:08.240
This is a Big Mac too.

15:08.240 --> 15:09.120
It's a sequel I made up.

15:09.120 --> 15:10.160
I cooked it once.

15:10.160 --> 15:11.120
Everybody else do this.

15:11.120 --> 15:11.920
I'm going home.

15:13.040 --> 15:14.000
It's the end of my work day.

15:15.520 --> 15:16.720
The food inventor.

15:16.720 --> 15:17.760
I have a...

15:17.760 --> 15:20.800
We got so many good Yahoos in the past couple of days.

15:20.800 --> 15:24.640
A lot of them don't give us much of a runway for goofs, but I love them so much.

15:24.640 --> 15:28.160
And instead of having eight closers at the end of each show, I've started to do Yahoo!

15:28.160 --> 15:28.640
Juniors.

15:28.640 --> 15:30.400
So here's a Yahoo!

15:30.400 --> 15:30.900
Junior.

15:32.480 --> 15:33.760
Jack sent this one in.

15:33.760 --> 15:34.400
Thank you, Jack.

15:34.400 --> 15:35.280
It's an anonymous Yahoo!

15:35.280 --> 15:40.320
Answers user who I'm going to call Bonobos because there's an ad for it on my screen

15:40.320 --> 15:48.320
who asks, what kind of facial hair is good for a writer slash poet?

15:48.320 --> 15:52.320
Anything that's long enough that you can dip it in the ink.

15:52.320 --> 15:53.920
Oh, Travis.

15:54.720 --> 15:57.120
I was just about to say the exact same thing.

15:58.480 --> 15:58.980
Damn it.

16:00.480 --> 16:03.120
Now I don't have any jokes for the podcast.

16:04.080 --> 16:09.040
You stole the obvious one where they dip their facial hair in ink, like a quill.

16:09.040 --> 16:16.560
How about you just cut your beard into the shape of some of your favorite letters?

16:19.680 --> 16:24.320
Like a basketball number shaped in the back of your head that's just like A in your cheek.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.200
Here's a big boy Yahoo!

16:29.200 --> 16:30.320
This one was sent in by Sean.

16:30.320 --> 16:30.880
Thank you, Sean.

16:30.880 --> 16:31.760
It's anonymous.

16:31.760 --> 16:35.920
No, they have a name, but the Wi-Fi just won't give it to me.

16:35.920 --> 16:39.840
So I'm going to call them Bezos because here he is in another advertisement.

16:39.840 --> 16:40.960
Oh no, this is news.

16:46.080 --> 16:51.600
He's having some marital troubles.

16:53.520 --> 16:54.800
Why are you laughing?

16:56.080 --> 16:58.720
That's America's billionaire Jeff Bezos.

16:58.720 --> 17:04.240
If we play it cool, he might give us some money.

17:07.280 --> 17:10.480
He did the internet bookstore where we get our books.

17:11.840 --> 17:17.280
Bezos asks, would you ever betray your soccer team

17:17.280 --> 17:29.520
to impress someone or for any other reason?

17:33.920 --> 17:37.120
If so, give me the reasons.

17:39.120 --> 17:42.960
I think the only reason I would betray my soccer team

17:42.960 --> 17:49.280
is if there was someone on the other team that I was crushing on.

17:49.280 --> 17:50.320
Yeah, yeah.

17:50.320 --> 17:54.720
And I thought, oh, they're looking if I were like an open net.

17:56.000 --> 17:56.880
Yeah, they have those.

17:56.880 --> 17:57.280
Sure.

17:57.280 --> 17:57.760
Yeah.

17:57.760 --> 17:59.920
And I scored and like, oh, they'll be angry.

17:59.920 --> 18:02.800
But maybe if I let them win the big game, they'll be so happy.

18:02.800 --> 18:05.840
But no, because they'd want to see your fire, your passion.

18:05.840 --> 18:07.280
No, but that's the thing up till now.

18:07.280 --> 18:09.600
What's kept us apart is my fire and passion.

18:09.600 --> 18:10.880
I see, I see.

18:10.880 --> 18:13.280
To Ben's and put their needs in front of my own.

18:13.280 --> 18:14.960
Yeah, they want a real quitter.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.880
I just need to see that you can't follow through on something.

18:20.880 --> 18:25.120
I'm thinking soccer has a thing called own goal.

18:25.120 --> 18:28.640
Soccer may be the most sabotageable sport.

18:29.600 --> 18:35.280
If you really put your back into it, you can make it like it's a hundred and four to zero.

18:35.280 --> 18:37.920
What the fuck is going on out there?

18:37.920 --> 18:42.400
That is that is true, because with soccer, the ball could like maybe bounce off of the goal

18:42.400 --> 18:44.080
and roll back the other way and accident.

18:44.080 --> 18:47.600
It's really hard to accidentally score a basket on yourself.

18:47.600 --> 18:52.320
Like, oh, it bounced off the backboard and across the whole court right into the other basket.

18:52.320 --> 18:55.600
And with baseball, you would need to hit it so hard.

18:55.600 --> 18:56.560
It went around the earth.

18:57.120 --> 18:57.360
Yes.

18:58.080 --> 19:01.840
And then came back around the next inning and then went over the hockey.

19:01.840 --> 19:05.440
You could fight your own players like, oh, shit, man, I happen to get I'm sorry.

19:05.440 --> 19:07.360
With these masks on, it's like, who knows?

19:07.360 --> 19:09.040
Oh, we're in blue.

19:09.040 --> 19:09.440
OK.

19:10.480 --> 19:14.000
You ever think about how baseball is going to think about sports a lot?

19:15.040 --> 19:15.920
Love sports.

19:17.200 --> 19:18.560
You ever think about baseball?

19:19.120 --> 19:21.760
They have a statistic for how many times you fuck up.

19:22.880 --> 19:27.120
Like, it's a stack called error, and it means you fucked up and we wrote it down.

19:28.480 --> 19:31.520
And there's a number that we associate with your God,

19:31.520 --> 19:33.520
I'm glad that's not like a real life feature.

19:34.160 --> 19:35.040
It's a big count.

19:35.040 --> 19:36.480
Oh, McElroy is up to the.

19:36.480 --> 19:39.120
Wow, this guy has errors out the wazoo.

19:40.160 --> 19:42.000
They didn't even give it like a euphemism.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.760
It's no error error.

19:44.480 --> 19:46.560
That was the wrong at baseball.

19:46.560 --> 19:48.880
You did the wrong baseball that time, friend.

19:48.880 --> 19:51.520
You got the golden glove for no goofing ups.

19:52.560 --> 19:53.120
Oh, yeah.

19:53.120 --> 19:55.440
Justin McElroy, he goes back to the catch.

19:55.440 --> 19:57.280
Oh, that's another bad he did.

19:57.280 --> 19:58.400
He did a bad job.

19:59.040 --> 20:02.480
You know, the secret is to betray your soccer team,

20:02.480 --> 20:04.720
but not let them know that they've been betrayed.

20:04.720 --> 20:06.400
Oh, you go.

20:06.400 --> 20:07.360
Here's the thing.

20:07.360 --> 20:10.960
You leave your carton, your cooler of Little Debbie's

20:10.960 --> 20:13.760
and hug juices over on the other team.

20:13.760 --> 20:15.760
I haven't played soccer since elementary school.

20:15.760 --> 20:18.320
So they do that in the pros, too.

20:18.320 --> 20:19.120
Yeah, you leave it over there.

20:19.120 --> 20:21.680
And then when you go to fetch one, you just trip and you're like,

20:21.680 --> 20:24.400
oh, no, all my tiny rolled up scrolls, right?

20:25.360 --> 20:27.840
And then on one of them, you're accomplice

20:27.840 --> 20:30.240
that the other team looks through and on one of them

20:30.240 --> 20:31.680
is written a coded phrase.

20:31.680 --> 20:33.680
And when they decode it, it says,

20:33.680 --> 20:36.640
we're going to try to kick the ball into your goal more times.

20:38.320 --> 20:40.000
Yeah, you kick it into ours.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.320
So then their their minds in the right place.

20:42.320 --> 20:44.400
They know exact every move you try.

20:44.960 --> 20:46.880
There will be a point in the game where it looks like

20:46.880 --> 20:48.560
I'm trying to take the ball downfield,

20:48.560 --> 20:50.800
but then I'm going to kick it to somebody else

20:50.800 --> 20:51.680
and they're going to do this.

20:51.680 --> 20:53.760
Sometimes you guys will have the ball

20:53.760 --> 20:55.600
and we'll try to get it with our feet.

20:56.960 --> 20:58.000
You hear that, guys?

20:58.000 --> 21:00.640
The note just says, I won't be using my hands.

21:00.640 --> 21:02.560
We have a secret weapon.

21:02.560 --> 21:04.560
One of our people can use their hands.

21:05.360 --> 21:07.360
You'll never guess which one.

21:09.360 --> 21:10.720
Here's another question.

21:10.720 --> 21:11.520
My dad works at a-

21:11.520 --> 21:14.480
Oh, I think they're talking about being a fan of a soccer team.

21:24.080 --> 21:25.040
Dad gone.

21:25.040 --> 21:28.560
Dad gone.

21:28.560 --> 21:33.280
Some of these folks really like their soccer teams.

21:44.560 --> 21:46.720
There's three pages of answers.

21:48.560 --> 21:50.720
Why can't we say the word bollocks?

21:50.720 --> 21:56.800
I think that should be everyone's takeaway for the evening.

21:59.360 --> 22:00.800
We take everything else.

22:00.800 --> 22:02.560
Certainly we could just take that too, right?

22:04.240 --> 22:05.360
So can I read the next question?

22:05.360 --> 22:05.760
Please.

22:05.760 --> 22:06.000
Okay.

22:07.040 --> 22:10.640
My dad works at a small company that manufactures meat thermometers.

22:10.640 --> 22:12.880
It's actually a pretty cool product.

22:12.880 --> 22:15.280
I've seen it used by Anthony on Queer Eye.

22:15.280 --> 22:21.440
Presumably to measure the temperature of an avocado.

22:21.440 --> 22:21.760
Yes.

22:23.520 --> 22:24.400
But my dad-

22:24.400 --> 22:26.000
In this season, he stepped up the-

22:26.000 --> 22:27.440
I'm not going to stand for that.

22:27.440 --> 22:29.680
It's a new Anthony season three.

22:29.680 --> 22:32.240
This time he showed how to make the toast that goes with the avocado.

22:32.240 --> 22:33.280
But my dad-

22:33.280 --> 22:34.000
Hateful.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.400
My dad has become borderline obsessed.

22:36.400 --> 22:41.280
Two years ago for Christmas Eve, he gave us all key chain sized meat thermometers.

22:41.280 --> 22:47.120
Now, when we go out to restaurants, he has a habit of interrogating the waitstaff about the kitchen's meat cooking methods.

22:47.120 --> 22:49.280
Even though he always orders salads?

22:50.880 --> 22:56.480
How do I make him understand that there are better times to promote his product than when I'm just trying to order chicken piccata?

22:56.480 --> 22:59.840
That's from the sins of the father in Salt Lake City.

23:01.840 --> 23:02.640
Are you-

23:02.640 --> 23:03.760
Wait, are you here?

23:04.800 --> 23:05.280
Yes.

23:05.280 --> 23:05.920
Yes, okay.

23:05.920 --> 23:07.360
Yes, did you bring us one?

23:07.360 --> 23:08.960
One of your cool new thermometers.

23:08.960 --> 23:09.760
I guess so.

23:09.760 --> 23:11.280
Your cool new thermometers.

23:11.280 --> 23:16.400
I guess my first question is, a key chain meat thermometer, for when?

23:16.400 --> 23:16.880
Yeah.

23:17.840 --> 23:19.520
When does that come up?

23:19.520 --> 23:25.760
Well, I have a key chain bottle opener, so I can see it having some sort of outdoor grilling party use.

23:25.760 --> 23:30.640
But, I don't have to wash my key chain every time I use it.

23:30.640 --> 23:33.200
I don't have to wash my bottle opener every time I use it.

23:33.200 --> 23:33.920
If you're dunking your-

23:33.920 --> 23:35.200
Before and after.

23:35.200 --> 23:41.200
Before and after, if I'm dunking my fucking keys into a piece of raw chicken?

23:43.040 --> 23:44.080
Hopefully it's not raw.

23:44.080 --> 23:45.040
Not raw, though.

23:45.040 --> 23:46.160
Certainly not raw.

23:46.160 --> 23:48.960
Listen, I've had E. coli more than once.

23:52.240 --> 23:53.600
He's had G. coli.

23:53.600 --> 23:55.280
I've had, yeah, I've had F. coli.

23:55.280 --> 23:57.440
I need, I need me one of these.

24:00.160 --> 24:04.240
When your dad, this is how I assume that the conversation in the restaurant goes like,

24:04.240 --> 24:05.920
oh, I just saw you brought a steak out.

24:05.920 --> 24:07.280
Oh, yeah, that's our primary.

24:07.280 --> 24:09.680
I'm not, I'm just wondering, are you sure it's done?

24:11.840 --> 24:12.720
Yeah?

24:12.720 --> 24:13.360
Yeah, I think so.

24:13.360 --> 24:14.960
Are you sure?

24:15.760 --> 24:16.080
Huh.

24:16.640 --> 24:18.480
Well, now that you mentioned it, no.

24:20.880 --> 24:26.640
Damn, I was so ready to dunk on your dad, but I really have had E. coli a couple times,

24:26.640 --> 24:34.080
and I'm thinking about it, and I know that you're not supposed to over grill a burger

24:34.080 --> 24:42.480
for instance, but I had a hammed burger today at our hotel, and I asked for it medium,

24:42.480 --> 24:46.720
and I bit into it, and it was the good pink color inside that you want it to be sometimes,

24:46.720 --> 24:50.480
but that still had that part of me that's like, I'm not a shit.

24:50.480 --> 24:52.080
I don't know how pink is too pink.

24:52.080 --> 24:55.520
If I could have had a small apparatus that I just had in my wallet or something.

24:55.520 --> 24:58.240
And it's not just for measuring your consumable meat.

24:58.240 --> 25:01.520
If you have a friend that's like, well, I'm not feeling very good.

25:01.520 --> 25:04.000
You just be like, well, hold on a second, roll up your sleeve.

25:04.000 --> 25:04.320
Jab.

25:08.960 --> 25:10.480
98.6, looks okay to me.

25:10.480 --> 25:10.960
Yeah.

25:10.960 --> 25:11.760
Would you say that you're-

25:11.760 --> 25:13.520
You're undercooked though, you're raw.

25:14.480 --> 25:17.360
Would you say your arm is similar to a pork loin?

25:18.720 --> 25:19.920
Hey man, well done.

25:23.600 --> 25:24.320
I'm called for.

25:25.120 --> 25:29.680
Here's the thing, I would say, your dad sounds like a closer to me.

25:29.680 --> 25:32.880
That's how you go from being a small meat thermometer business-

25:32.880 --> 25:33.200
Yes.

25:33.200 --> 25:35.920
To a successful large meat thermometer business.

25:35.920 --> 25:38.480
Well, the meat thermometers would still be small.

25:38.480 --> 25:41.120
Let's not get it twisted because it is key chain size.

25:41.120 --> 25:45.120
He could go on Shark Tank and when he's doing his pitch, he can be like,

25:45.120 --> 25:47.840
I've annoyed over 30 Applebee's.

25:49.920 --> 25:55.360
Yes, I'm the man you've heard about from the stories of Applebee's employees.

25:55.360 --> 25:58.240
Las Cruces Applebee's, I've annoyed them.

25:58.960 --> 26:01.520
Urbana, Applebee's, both.

26:01.520 --> 26:02.080
Yes.

26:03.280 --> 26:04.560
They hate my guts.

26:05.600 --> 26:08.160
I've been banned from several Applebee's.

26:09.680 --> 26:12.320
I have a Yahoo Junior here that was sent in by Riley.

26:12.320 --> 26:13.040
Thank you, Riley.

26:13.040 --> 26:14.400
It's from- Oh, I got it.

26:15.200 --> 26:17.760
Yahoo answers user Trouble Gum who asks,

26:19.200 --> 26:23.200
is it safe for me to lick my Himalayan salt lamp every now and then?

26:23.200 --> 26:26.880
Every now and then?

26:26.880 --> 26:29.920
Yeah, more than that though and you don't have a lamp anymore.

26:29.920 --> 26:30.880
That's a good point.

26:32.320 --> 26:35.680
My Himalayan salt lamp is fricking delicious.

26:37.680 --> 26:39.200
Better than table salt.

26:39.200 --> 26:42.880
I give it a lick every now and then, maybe once a day or two.

26:46.800 --> 26:51.040
And it's safe for me to lick my Himalayan salt lamp every now and then.

26:51.040 --> 26:56.400
And it is the most gratifying taste.

26:57.520 --> 26:57.840
Why?

26:57.840 --> 26:58.960
Are you a deer?

27:01.440 --> 27:06.880
Would there be any trace minerals in it that could harm me or actually improve my health?

27:08.320 --> 27:10.960
I can answer the second one and it's no.

27:10.960 --> 27:15.040
Well, well, my allergies and eczema have vanished.

27:15.040 --> 27:19.120
The air stays cool, dry, and comfortable.

27:19.120 --> 27:20.320
What?

27:21.600 --> 27:23.120
Because you licked the lamp?

27:24.720 --> 27:27.520
Sounds like you're adding some minerals to it.

27:29.200 --> 27:30.400
Also-

27:30.400 --> 27:31.760
Can I lick you?

27:32.560 --> 27:34.720
Sounds like you've got choice minerals.

27:36.000 --> 27:39.040
It is weird to say it is more delicious than table salt

27:39.040 --> 27:42.400
unless you are just licking table salt by itself as well.

27:42.400 --> 27:49.920
Well, somebody does point out you can buy Himalayan pink salt.

27:49.920 --> 27:53.120
And that just buying salt lamps is not a very cost-effective way of going about-

27:53.120 --> 27:54.880
You can just buy it and then sprinkle it on a light bulb.

27:54.880 --> 27:56.000
It would almost be, yeah.

27:57.200 --> 28:02.240
Eating that would almost be better than eating one with wires in it, if you think about it.

28:04.800 --> 28:06.960
Here's a big Yahoo from Peyton.

28:06.960 --> 28:07.520
Thanks, Peyton.

28:07.520 --> 28:09.840
It's Yahoo Answers user Spike who asks,

28:09.840 --> 28:13.040
Why do people think my fighting stance is weak?

28:16.560 --> 28:18.560
This is the best first sentence.

28:20.080 --> 28:23.120
I have three weak points on my body.

28:23.120 --> 28:36.960
On my body, my nose, my jaw, and my stomach, and my crack.

28:43.120 --> 28:45.520
My neck, my back, my solar plexus.

28:47.920 --> 28:52.000
My right fist is in front of my nose.

28:52.000 --> 28:53.600
My left fist is in front of my jaw.

28:53.600 --> 28:56.560
And I keep my chin low so I'm looking through my eyebrows.

28:57.840 --> 28:58.800
Well, that's nothing.

28:58.800 --> 29:02.480
Like I'm a character in Fallout 3 who's just like clipping.

29:03.040 --> 29:03.600
Bugged out.

29:04.480 --> 29:07.440
I have a slight bend in my knees to hunch my stomach.

29:07.440 --> 29:08.240
Can one of you like-

29:08.240 --> 29:08.800
Yeah, I'll do it.

29:08.800 --> 29:09.680
Start at the beginning.

29:09.680 --> 29:10.640
We'll probably cut this out.

29:10.640 --> 29:12.080
So this is just for you guys.

29:16.880 --> 29:18.240
Demonstrate your weak points.

29:18.240 --> 29:19.760
Your nose, jaw, and stomach.

29:19.760 --> 29:21.600
Yes. Nose, jaw, stomach.

29:21.600 --> 29:22.100
Thank you.

29:22.560 --> 29:25.680
My right fist is in front of my nose.

29:25.680 --> 29:27.280
My left hand's on blue.

29:27.280 --> 29:30.160
My left fist is in front of my jaw.

29:30.160 --> 29:33.360
And I keep my chin low so I'm looking through my eyebrows.

29:38.320 --> 29:44.560
I have a slight bend in my knees to hunch my stomach back.

29:45.520 --> 29:46.480
Bend the knees though.

29:47.280 --> 29:47.840
Keep them bent.

29:47.840 --> 29:48.960
You got to bend those knees.

29:48.960 --> 29:50.160
You got to bend those knees.

29:52.000 --> 29:56.000
And I bob and weave my head back and forth to be ready for a dodge encounter.

29:58.800 --> 30:02.480
I bob and weave my head back and forth to be ready for a dodge encounter.

30:04.240 --> 30:06.400
The only part of my skull-

30:06.400 --> 30:09.120
The only part of my skull that is exposed and hard enough-

30:09.120 --> 30:11.120
Is hard enough to break your hand.

30:11.120 --> 30:13.360
Hell, we headbutt for a reason, right?

30:13.920 --> 30:14.720
That's all, Justin.

30:14.720 --> 30:15.220
Thank you.

30:15.220 --> 30:23.780
There's more to the question, but that's all the demo we need.

30:23.780 --> 30:26.100
In my mind, this is the perfect stance.

30:26.100 --> 30:30.580
But for some reason, when I show this stance, my friends think I can't fight.

30:30.580 --> 30:32.500
Seeing it, I can't imagine.

30:34.020 --> 30:39.300
Now, we are full-grown adults, but we don't dare find out.

30:39.300 --> 30:41.220
It could get ugly fast.

30:41.220 --> 30:45.620
And tbh, I don't have much fighting experience.

30:47.860 --> 30:51.300
So I'm just hoping to get perspective from fighters.

30:51.300 --> 30:55.300
Is my stance actually bad or are they playing mind games?

30:55.300 --> 30:59.620
Because I kind of let them mess with me a little bit because they're my buddies.

31:00.900 --> 31:04.420
Sometimes I want to kick someone's ass just to prove I could.

31:05.220 --> 31:07.620
Other times, I'm not sure I can.

31:07.620 --> 31:11.540
I've always had the perfect demeanor in life to avoid all conflict.

31:11.540 --> 31:14.100
Never the victim and never the instigator.

31:14.100 --> 31:16.980
Something about me makes people not want to test me.

31:16.980 --> 31:19.460
But I sure as shoot don't test anyone either.

31:19.460 --> 31:23.380
So I just avoided so much fighting by simply not having to.

31:23.380 --> 31:26.180
It's a strange feeling to not know where I stand.

31:30.900 --> 31:34.500
The Kelsey Grammer autobiography is so much weirder than you think it's gonna be.

31:34.500 --> 31:37.860
Is it possible that your friends don't think your physical stance is weak,

31:37.860 --> 31:40.900
but rather your metaphysical stance on fighting?

31:40.900 --> 31:41.400
Yeah.

31:42.500 --> 31:42.980
I don't know.

31:42.980 --> 31:43.700
I don't want to test you.

31:43.700 --> 31:44.200
Weak.

31:45.700 --> 31:50.100
I've never been in a traditional fight.

31:51.700 --> 31:57.300
But if the only part of me you can hit is the top of my skull,

31:58.900 --> 32:01.220
I'm basically an ankylosaurus at that.

32:01.220 --> 32:04.740
I'm basically an ankylosaurus at that point.

32:05.940 --> 32:09.540
You're just getting my plating at that, you know?

32:09.540 --> 32:10.420
Here's the thing, though.

32:10.420 --> 32:14.340
I feel like saying I only have three weak points is a strong stance

32:14.340 --> 32:18.340
when I'm thinking about my own body and I can list off at least 27.

32:20.180 --> 32:23.540
I'm too high on the earth and I feel weak.

32:23.540 --> 32:25.300
Travis has altitude poisoning.

32:26.580 --> 32:29.860
I woke up bad from sleeping and I hurt.

32:29.860 --> 32:35.620
I have inside weak points that sometimes I eat some angel hair pasta

32:35.620 --> 32:38.580
for the Cheesecake Factory and then I spend a whole live show

32:38.580 --> 32:41.540
thinking about how excited I am to poop as soon as it's over.

32:46.660 --> 32:47.460
How did it know?

32:48.900 --> 32:51.220
One of my big weak points is time.

32:52.260 --> 32:55.220
Just my physical age on the earth.

32:55.220 --> 32:57.940
I like that we can all agree this person's never been in a fight.

32:58.660 --> 32:59.700
Yes, correct.

32:59.700 --> 33:04.020
I want to know who we headbutt for a reason is referring to.

33:05.460 --> 33:07.220
A team he's on, maybe?

33:07.220 --> 33:08.260
A club?

33:08.260 --> 33:09.860
I like humans in general.

33:09.860 --> 33:11.860
Humans in general headbutt for a reason?

33:11.860 --> 33:12.340
I don't know.

33:13.540 --> 33:18.180
This is a response from Yahoo Answers user All Hat who says,

33:18.820 --> 33:22.420
best way to learn about that is to enroll in a boxing gym or karate school.

33:23.220 --> 33:26.500
There, of course, you actually do spar and it's legal and so forth.

33:26.500 --> 33:31.060
I love that because I'm this person and I show up to karate school

33:32.100 --> 33:33.700
and I say, what do you think about this?

33:36.660 --> 33:40.020
And then they're like, it's bad and nothing.

33:40.020 --> 33:42.260
And you could say, thanks for the lessons.

33:43.620 --> 33:44.180
You know what?

33:44.180 --> 33:46.100
I'll come back when I have something better.

33:46.100 --> 33:49.940
When you do it, Griffin, it kind of looks like you're playing like air saxophone.

33:49.940 --> 33:50.660
It did a little bit.

33:50.660 --> 33:51.300
I felt that way.

33:51.300 --> 33:57.140
You know all about that as big jazz fans here.

33:57.140 --> 33:57.700
Yeah, sure.

34:00.180 --> 34:07.620
We are in your airport and there is a room labeled Jazz Room

34:08.660 --> 34:13.060
and Travis is walking past and said, it's all about the rooms you don't go into.

34:13.060 --> 34:14.900
That's a very good joke.

34:14.900 --> 34:22.020
Asshole.

34:22.020 --> 34:23.620
Jazz it up for us there, Justin.

34:23.620 --> 34:24.260
Good idea.

34:27.060 --> 34:28.020
You guys love jazz.

34:28.020 --> 34:48.420
That's pretty good jazz.

34:48.420 --> 34:49.620
I want a munch.

34:49.620 --> 34:58.260
I want a munch.

34:58.260 --> 35:00.500
Toast salad and scrambled eggs.

35:05.780 --> 35:06.980
Welcome to Munch Squad.

35:06.980 --> 35:11.300
It's a podcast within a podcast that covers the latest and greatest in brand eating.

35:12.340 --> 35:14.500
This week we have a big story for you.

35:14.500 --> 35:16.980
Heinz cream egg mayo.

35:16.980 --> 35:21.460
It wasn't an April fool.

35:23.300 --> 35:25.780
You can try it for yourself.

35:25.780 --> 35:27.860
Cream egg?

35:27.860 --> 35:30.500
Cadbury cream egg mayonnaise.

35:34.180 --> 35:39.620
Because I was about to say mayonnaise is technically a kind of creamy egg substance.

35:40.580 --> 35:44.660
We were a little wary when this story comes to us from Metro.

35:44.660 --> 35:46.980
What day was it posted?

35:46.980 --> 35:47.620
April 3rd.

35:48.740 --> 35:49.700
Yes, this is right.

35:49.700 --> 35:50.980
This is happening.

35:50.980 --> 35:55.860
We were a little wary when we first heard Cadbury cream egg mayonnaise was a thing.

35:56.740 --> 35:58.420
I can't imagine why.

35:58.420 --> 35:59.940
Yeah, a little wary.

35:59.940 --> 36:02.500
You've been dulled by the past few years, I think.

36:04.580 --> 36:07.140
Mainly because it was announced close to April Fool's Day

36:08.020 --> 36:13.460
and it wouldn't be the first time this product was announced as an April fool.

36:13.460 --> 36:15.140
But actually the news is true.

36:16.180 --> 36:21.140
We regret to inform you that this day that will live in infamy.

36:21.140 --> 36:22.580
Hug your loved ones close.

36:24.580 --> 36:28.740
Nearer my God to thee, the creamy condiment does exist.

36:29.220 --> 36:30.740
You can actually try it.

36:30.740 --> 36:34.900
Heinz and Cadbury have partnered in hell to create.

36:34.900 --> 36:45.140
It's called the Heinz, seriously good, Cadbury cream egg mayonnaise.

36:45.140 --> 36:49.380
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

36:49.380 --> 36:50.260
Fuck yes.

36:51.940 --> 36:52.580
What's up?

36:52.580 --> 36:53.620
We're Coca-Cola.

36:53.620 --> 36:54.900
We made a broccoli flavor.

36:54.900 --> 36:55.940
We called it.

36:55.940 --> 36:57.220
Seriously, it's good.

36:58.500 --> 37:00.100
Try it once, coward.

37:00.100 --> 37:05.700
This unusual concoction is going to be available for a limited time.

37:05.700 --> 37:06.580
Thank Christ.

37:07.380 --> 37:14.820
At a unique Heinz X Cadbury cream egg installation, which is a bad place

37:16.580 --> 37:23.300
at the Truman brewery in London, sadly, from April 11th to the 13th.

37:23.300 --> 37:24.340
I gotta buy some plain tickets.

37:24.340 --> 37:25.300
There's a caption.

37:25.300 --> 37:31.540
The caption of the photo says the mayonnaise, which is a pot of mayo mixed with pieces of

37:31.540 --> 37:34.580
cream egg, hold on.

37:34.580 --> 37:36.180
It's a Cadbury aioli.

37:40.660 --> 37:47.540
I can't believe they'd give away the yuck juice family secret like that.

37:47.540 --> 37:52.020
The next sentence from this publication is wild, though we're pleased that this isn't

37:52.020 --> 37:55.540
an April fool, why?

37:56.500 --> 37:59.300
We're not sure it will taste all that nice.

38:00.020 --> 38:04.820
God, Patty, that is the most generous sentence I've ever heard in the English language.

38:04.820 --> 38:09.780
And what a weird swing of a sentence of like, we're glad it's real, but also, ew.

38:09.780 --> 38:11.060
Ew, gross.

38:11.060 --> 38:16.340
I know people are always talking about ethics and condiment review blogs, but it's that

38:16.340 --> 38:20.180
kind of like sticking it to the man that I really appreciate.

38:20.180 --> 38:26.900
On the launch, Martina Davis, who is the brand manager for Heinz Seriously Good Mayonnaise,

38:26.900 --> 38:29.780
said, oh, what a short time career.

38:29.780 --> 38:30.580
Yeah.

38:30.580 --> 38:31.780
And, and.

38:31.780 --> 38:32.980
I just bought a house.

38:32.980 --> 38:34.020
Ew.

38:34.020 --> 38:35.780
And war criminal.

38:38.420 --> 38:46.260
She said, we have had so much fun creating this unique cream egg mayo because we're sadists.

38:46.260 --> 38:51.380
For Easter, with our friends over at Cadbury, we absolutely cannot wait for people to try

38:51.380 --> 38:51.940
it.

38:51.940 --> 39:00.580
The, the photo that they've distributed here is the tub of Heinz Seriously Good Cream Egg

39:00.580 --> 39:05.780
Mayonnaise with a little Cadbury cream egg leaning next to it in a jaunty fashion.

39:05.780 --> 39:12.500
And then behind, in the back, blurred out, out of focus, is a jar of good old fashioned

39:12.500 --> 39:20.100
good mayonnaise, and it's got a real egg leaning against it, as if to say, like, you know, eggs.

39:21.700 --> 39:23.060
They've both got eggs.

39:24.500 --> 39:31.380
It almost looks like the, the wayward boyfriend meme, and he's like looking at the Cadbury

39:31.380 --> 39:36.420
cream egg, like, oh, it's, except they're both, it's like that photo, except if everyone

39:36.420 --> 39:37.460
in it was vomiting.

39:37.460 --> 39:38.020
Yeah.

39:38.020 --> 39:41.860
The quote from Martina continues, it's unlike anything you've ever tasted before.

39:41.860 --> 39:43.220
I should sure the fuck hope so.

39:45.700 --> 39:48.180
A true, it's a true taste sensation.

39:49.220 --> 39:52.660
If everyone loves it as much as they do, then who knows?

39:52.660 --> 39:55.540
We might have to roll it out nationwide one day.

39:55.540 --> 39:57.060
Don't fucking threaten me.

39:58.500 --> 40:00.820
Please, don't like it as much as we do.

40:00.820 --> 40:03.780
It says, and then it says, I swear to God, it says, watch this space.

40:03.780 --> 40:05.300
Sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

40:05.300 --> 40:08.100
And then it says, I swear to God, it says, watch this space.

40:08.100 --> 40:13.380
So I'm assuming that Martina just spread her butt cheeks apart at that point.

40:14.260 --> 40:20.900
Raphael Capitani, the brand manager for Cadbury cream egg added, fuck if I know, right?

40:20.900 --> 40:30.100
Anyway, no, Raphael says, we're so excited to announce that our Heinz, seriously good,

40:30.100 --> 40:34.580
Cadbury cream egg mayo collaboration is actually happening, and we can't wait for people to

40:34.580 --> 40:40.500
try it for themselves because we're fucked up and nasty to the max, it says here.

40:41.540 --> 40:45.460
We're looking forward to seeing cream egg and Heinz fans head down to the installation

40:45.460 --> 40:48.340
to taste this deliciously gooey spread.

40:53.780 --> 40:54.740
Oh, God.

40:54.740 --> 40:55.780
Oh, God.

40:55.780 --> 40:57.300
I can taste it now.

40:58.900 --> 40:59.460
You know what?

40:59.460 --> 41:01.620
I will say it is evocative writing.

41:01.620 --> 41:04.660
I will say, anyway, that's this week's lunch squad.

41:16.340 --> 41:17.220
Hey, everybody, this is Griffin.

41:17.220 --> 41:20.900
I'm going to do the ads myself because everybody's kind of scrambling right now.

41:20.900 --> 41:26.260
We're about to kick off the Become the Monster Tour 2019 coming for you, Cleveland.

41:26.260 --> 41:28.980
Going to just eat you up.

41:28.980 --> 41:32.180
And so I'm going to do the sponsorships.

41:32.180 --> 41:34.660
Sorry about the audio quality of this one.

41:35.380 --> 41:43.300
I tried to tweak the knobs and the dials that I have on the big switchboard that I have

41:43.300 --> 41:49.540
in my production studio that the Doobie Brothers let me use sometimes, and I did my best.

41:49.540 --> 41:54.900
Anyway, Squarespace has given us a sponsorship, and I'm going to tell you all about them

41:54.900 --> 41:55.860
starting right now.

41:55.860 --> 41:57.620
Have you ever heard of Squarespace?

41:57.620 --> 42:00.660
They're the ones who make you do websites.

42:00.660 --> 42:03.140
They're the ones who give you the tools to do websites.

42:03.140 --> 42:03.620
That's better.

42:04.340 --> 42:09.380
They have all kinds of very handy stuff like, I don't know, man.

42:09.380 --> 42:10.980
They got like templates.

42:10.980 --> 42:12.420
They got these templates.

42:12.420 --> 42:15.380
They were made by world-class designers, so you know that they're not shit.

42:15.940 --> 42:20.500
And then they also have powerful e-commerce functionality.

42:20.500 --> 42:22.980
Dollars and cents makes the world go round.

42:22.980 --> 42:26.340
And they also have 24-7 award-winning customer support.

42:26.340 --> 42:31.380
So, they basically have everything that you need to make a very successful website.

42:32.020 --> 42:34.980
Not a pets.com.

42:34.980 --> 42:36.180
That one is gone.

42:36.180 --> 42:37.540
That website died.

42:37.540 --> 42:42.420
But a very good website, pets.com2, maybe, even if you wanted to.

42:42.420 --> 42:47.700
So go to squarespace.com slash my brother and get a free trial when you're ready to launch.

42:47.700 --> 42:52.340
Use the offer code my brother, and you'll save 10% off your first purchase of a website

42:52.340 --> 42:53.460
or a domain.

42:53.460 --> 42:54.420
Get out there.

42:54.420 --> 42:57.300
Pets.com2 is waiting for you.

42:57.300 --> 42:59.460
I'm also going to tell you about MeUndies.

42:59.460 --> 43:06.180
MeUndies has a very exciting scientific development they've been working on in their underground

43:06.180 --> 43:07.460
underwear lab.

43:08.580 --> 43:11.140
And they do horrible experiments down there.

43:11.140 --> 43:14.820
Horrible, horrible experiments involving elastic.

43:14.820 --> 43:19.860
And somebody gets that they did super elastic because they were like, our fabric is super

43:19.860 --> 43:23.140
soft, so let's do, you know, maybe even a tighter elastic band.

43:23.140 --> 43:25.380
When, you know what, someone got cut right in half.

43:25.380 --> 43:29.860
I don't approve of that, but if it gets us this new development, which is boxer briefs

43:29.860 --> 43:35.780
with a fly, using the same micromodal fabric that's three times softer than cotton, it's

43:35.780 --> 43:37.700
a life changing revelation.

43:37.700 --> 43:42.660
I don't have to pull my, you know, my pants all the way down to my ankles whenever I have

43:42.660 --> 43:44.660
to pee in a public urinal.

43:44.660 --> 43:46.900
And that's what I've had to do traditionally.

43:46.900 --> 43:50.580
And there's people who say, Griffin, you don't have to pull them all the way down.

43:50.580 --> 43:54.180
And I said, yeah, dribble on these, Levi's?

43:54.180 --> 43:55.220
I don't think so.

43:56.900 --> 43:58.660
But now I know that that's wrong.

43:59.700 --> 44:03.940
You can get 15% off your first pair of MeUndies.

44:03.940 --> 44:05.780
You gotta get these boxer briefs ones.

44:07.060 --> 44:10.500
You can get free shipping and a 100% satisfaction guarantee.

44:10.500 --> 44:12.740
Go to MeUndies.com slash my brother.

44:12.740 --> 44:15.060
That's MeUndies.com slash my brother.

44:16.020 --> 44:17.620
I'm gonna let you get back to it.

44:17.620 --> 44:22.340
If you haven't looked at our tour, the Become the Monster tour, go check it out.

44:22.340 --> 44:23.220
McElroy.family.

44:23.220 --> 44:24.980
See if we're coming to a city near you.

44:25.620 --> 44:28.180
Actually, about half our shows have sold out at this point.

44:28.180 --> 44:32.420
There's still plenty available for Cleveland and Cincinnati, which are this week.

44:32.420 --> 44:36.020
So if you live in the Ohio area, come say hi.

44:36.020 --> 44:37.460
And I think that's it.

44:37.460 --> 44:38.420
Enjoy the rest of the episode.

44:38.420 --> 44:48.420
Goodbye.

45:09.380 --> 45:14.260
Club podcast where I speak with complicated, funny, messy humans as we reminisce about

45:14.260 --> 45:17.780
our adolescences and how they led us to becoming who we are.

45:17.780 --> 45:19.940
Find it every Thursday on Maximum Fun.

45:23.860 --> 45:24.500
Yes, hello.

45:25.060 --> 45:25.620
Howdy.

45:25.620 --> 45:26.180
Hey, what's up?

45:26.180 --> 45:26.580
Hi.

45:26.580 --> 45:27.300
What's your name?

45:27.300 --> 45:28.100
Who are you?

45:28.100 --> 45:29.140
You said my name, man.

45:30.500 --> 45:31.700
I just called like four people.

45:31.700 --> 45:32.660
Who's your, what's your name?

45:32.660 --> 45:33.140
Eli.

45:33.140 --> 45:33.780
Hello, Eli.

45:33.780 --> 45:35.380
Eli, you're leaning on the door.

45:35.380 --> 45:37.060
This is such a chill vibe.

45:37.060 --> 45:37.380
Yeah.

45:37.380 --> 45:39.620
Oh, believe me, I'm incredibly nervous.

45:39.620 --> 45:40.180
Okay, good.

45:42.020 --> 45:45.140
Your question, do you need a reminder of what your prompt was?

45:45.140 --> 45:46.500
No, I think I know it.

45:46.500 --> 45:46.820
Okay.

45:46.820 --> 45:48.740
You can read it if you want so everyone else knows it.

45:50.420 --> 45:57.380
Your prompt, your teaser is, and it was, we struggled with it, but we could not know more

45:57.380 --> 46:00.580
was, if I made you guys a knife, would you accept it?

46:00.580 --> 46:10.100
And we want to walk through this with you.

46:10.100 --> 46:10.500
All right.

46:11.220 --> 46:13.220
So I make knives as a hobby.

46:13.220 --> 46:13.940
Cool.

46:13.940 --> 46:14.980
And do you guys want one?

46:17.940 --> 46:20.100
Not necessarily the fertile.

46:20.100 --> 46:22.340
Once you've made a sale, stop selling.

46:24.420 --> 46:26.260
The answer is yes.

46:26.260 --> 46:26.900
Obviously.

46:26.900 --> 46:27.380
Sweet.

46:28.500 --> 46:28.820
Cool.

46:28.820 --> 46:29.700
Good talk.

46:29.700 --> 46:31.060
Yeah, thanks, Eli.

46:31.060 --> 46:32.420
Now, wait, wait, wait, hold on, wait.

46:34.420 --> 46:36.900
First off, holy shit, Paul.

46:37.540 --> 46:38.340
Really, bud?

46:38.900 --> 46:42.260
This is the strongest drink I've ever tasted in my life.

46:42.980 --> 46:44.500
In Salt Lake City.

46:44.500 --> 46:44.820
Yeah.

46:47.540 --> 46:47.940
Okay.

46:47.940 --> 46:51.940
It might be the strongest drink that exists in Salt Lake City right now.

46:51.940 --> 46:52.500
Okay.

46:52.500 --> 46:54.980
Eli, are we talking about cooking knives?

46:54.980 --> 46:57.140
Are we talking about stabbing knives?

46:57.140 --> 46:59.860
Are we talking about LARPing knives?

46:59.860 --> 47:02.180
That's how Mr. Bean would sell a stabbing knife.

47:05.140 --> 47:06.260
Depends on what you guys want.

47:08.260 --> 47:08.580
Cool.

47:08.580 --> 47:09.460
Knives to order.

47:10.420 --> 47:11.780
You really put me on the spot.

47:13.220 --> 47:16.260
I mean, here's the question.

47:16.260 --> 47:18.580
What's the delivery process going to look like?

47:18.580 --> 47:28.900
Because if the answer is into your torso, then hard pass.

47:28.900 --> 47:30.340
If you want me to stab you, I mean-

47:30.340 --> 47:31.460
No, I don't.

47:31.460 --> 47:32.100
No, no.

47:32.100 --> 47:33.940
I knew Eli would say that.

47:33.940 --> 47:34.580
Yeah.

47:34.580 --> 47:36.260
I got shit to do tomorrow.

47:36.260 --> 47:36.900
Oh, my bad.

47:37.940 --> 47:40.500
I would like a really tiny knife.

47:40.500 --> 47:40.820
All right.

47:40.820 --> 47:41.780
Oh, fun.

47:41.780 --> 47:42.500
Little butter knife.

47:42.500 --> 47:43.140
Give it to my daughter.

47:44.980 --> 47:46.020
I'm sentimental.

47:46.020 --> 47:50.660
I'm being careful here, Eli, because one time during a live show, to be funny,

47:50.660 --> 47:55.460
we said that someone should mail their decommissioned hand grenades to us.

47:55.460 --> 47:56.260
And they did.

47:56.260 --> 47:57.300
Yeah, we got those.

47:57.300 --> 47:58.260
And then they did.

47:58.260 --> 48:00.820
And I threw them in the trash because it sucked.

48:00.820 --> 48:02.420
No, you are a coward, sir.

48:02.420 --> 48:02.900
I'm a coward.

48:02.900 --> 48:07.380
Also, one time during a Taz, I yelled, does anybody have a pen?

48:07.380 --> 48:10.180
And people started throwing pins at me from the audience.

48:10.180 --> 48:16.340
So obviously, in this scenario, that would be a knife, bad and rough.

48:16.340 --> 48:16.980
Less than ideal.

48:16.980 --> 48:19.300
So I guess thank you for the knives in advance, Eli.

48:19.300 --> 48:20.820
I have so many more questions.

48:20.820 --> 48:26.260
Can it be made out of a cool sort of substance and not just necessarily metal?

48:26.260 --> 48:26.500
No.

48:29.060 --> 48:30.340
Do you forge them?

48:30.340 --> 48:31.220
Do you forge them?

48:31.220 --> 48:32.260
Yes, I do, actually.

48:32.260 --> 48:32.500
Okay.

48:32.500 --> 48:33.220
Sick.

48:33.220 --> 48:34.260
How sharp we talking?

48:35.780 --> 48:38.180
My first one wasn't that sharp, but I can make them sharper.

48:38.180 --> 48:38.820
But which-

48:38.820 --> 48:39.540
Wait, are you-

48:39.540 --> 48:42.580
Wait, what number of knives are you on?

48:42.580 --> 48:43.220
Stop.

48:43.220 --> 48:45.220
I don't want your second knife.

48:47.700 --> 48:52.020
Are you telling me you make knives as a hobby and so far your tally is one?

48:53.460 --> 48:55.300
And it wasn't that sharp?

48:55.300 --> 48:57.700
That's called a shitty spoon, Eli.

48:57.700 --> 48:58.740
No, no, no.

48:58.740 --> 49:00.260
Hey, don't step on Eli's dreams.

49:01.140 --> 49:02.580
How many knives have you made, Eli?

49:03.460 --> 49:04.020
One.

49:04.020 --> 49:10.500
All right.

49:10.500 --> 49:12.500
Eli, you are a pioneer.

49:12.500 --> 49:15.620
You don't make knives as a hobby, you make knife as a hobby.

49:15.620 --> 49:16.180
No, no, no.

49:16.180 --> 49:16.500
Listen, listen, listen.

49:16.500 --> 49:18.660
I mean, I plan on making more.

49:18.660 --> 49:19.460
I'm jealous-

49:19.460 --> 49:21.460
We all plan on making more.

49:21.460 --> 49:22.580
I'm jealous of your hobby.

49:22.580 --> 49:23.540
It's very cool and very-

49:23.540 --> 49:26.900
I like watching a good knife getting made on YouTube and that's not a joke.

49:26.900 --> 49:28.820
I have weird algorithms now.

49:28.820 --> 49:29.460
Alex Steele.

49:29.460 --> 49:34.420
I watched a Facebook video today about a new kind of cement mixer.

49:34.420 --> 49:35.220
That's where I'm at.

49:37.460 --> 49:39.700
I don't want your second knife, Eli.

49:39.700 --> 49:41.620
I'll make more and then I'll send them.

49:41.620 --> 49:44.820
I want your 20th knife.

49:44.820 --> 49:45.300
All right.

49:45.300 --> 49:46.580
I want you to stick with it.

49:46.580 --> 49:47.140
Stick with it.

49:47.140 --> 49:47.860
Never give up.

49:47.860 --> 49:48.660
Chase your dream.

49:49.220 --> 49:53.060
Get boutique on this shit and send me your 20th knife.

49:53.060 --> 49:55.780
You know, we're giving Eli a hard time.

49:55.780 --> 49:56.260
I'm not.

49:56.820 --> 49:58.340
I want you to chase your dreams.

49:58.340 --> 50:00.740
We wouldn't blow up Luke Skywalker this way, right?

50:00.740 --> 50:03.140
Like, this is only my first lightsaber I've made.

50:04.020 --> 50:05.460
And he didn't even make that one.

50:05.460 --> 50:07.540
Like, he didn't even pick the fucking kyber crystals.

50:07.540 --> 50:09.460
He was just like, well, I'll take my dad's, I guess.

50:12.180 --> 50:13.700
Anyway, Eli, does that help?

50:14.500 --> 50:14.980
Yes.

50:14.980 --> 50:15.780
Thank you, Eli.

50:15.780 --> 50:17.940
I look forward to receiving your 20th knife.

50:21.300 --> 50:22.820
Excellent work, Eli.

50:22.820 --> 50:24.900
Excellent work.

50:24.900 --> 50:25.620
What's up?

50:25.620 --> 50:26.500
Hello.

50:26.500 --> 50:27.060
Hello.

50:27.060 --> 50:27.940
What's your name?

50:27.940 --> 50:28.580
Cameron.

50:28.580 --> 50:28.900
Cameron.

50:28.900 --> 50:29.380
Hey, Cameron.

50:30.340 --> 50:30.820
No, you go.

50:34.100 --> 50:39.380
The prompt that Cameron provided was, how do I, parentheses, non-lethally.

50:40.260 --> 50:41.220
A good start.

50:41.780 --> 50:43.060
Booby trap my kitchen.

50:45.380 --> 50:45.700
All right.

50:45.700 --> 50:46.500
The floor is yours.

50:46.500 --> 50:47.700
So here's the story behind it.

50:47.700 --> 50:50.580
So I have five other roommates, including me.

50:50.580 --> 50:51.780
Well, I'm the sixth.

50:51.780 --> 50:53.620
So I have five roommates.

50:53.620 --> 50:54.820
Do you live in a terrace house?

50:54.820 --> 50:56.500
I live in a college house.

50:56.500 --> 50:57.000
Okay.

50:57.940 --> 50:59.700
And we share one kitchen.

51:00.260 --> 51:05.540
And so at the beginning of the year, we divvied up all of the drawers and cabinets and everything.

51:05.540 --> 51:08.340
And I have my cabinets and they have their cabinets.

51:09.140 --> 51:12.020
My cabinets go, the stuff in there goes missing a lot.

51:12.020 --> 51:15.540
Even though I said, hey, can you keep my stuff in my cabinets?

51:15.540 --> 51:19.140
So my question to you is how do I non-lethally booby trap?

51:19.140 --> 51:19.860
I got that much.

51:19.860 --> 51:20.100
Yeah.

51:20.100 --> 51:20.980
All of mine.

51:20.980 --> 51:21.480
Yeah.

51:22.340 --> 51:23.380
Maybe you can.

51:23.380 --> 51:26.420
Maybe rather than physical harm.

51:26.420 --> 51:27.380
Cause that's bad.

51:28.580 --> 51:29.940
What about emotional harm?

51:31.140 --> 51:32.980
Hear me out, hear me out, hear me out.

51:32.980 --> 51:34.100
They open the cabinet.

51:34.100 --> 51:36.900
You've installed a mirror and just you've written on it.

51:36.900 --> 51:37.620
Look at yourself.

51:37.620 --> 51:38.120
Yeah.

51:44.500 --> 51:47.540
And they have to really live with what they're doing.

51:47.540 --> 51:50.740
Or under your package of ciabatta bread,

51:50.740 --> 51:55.860
you've stuck a picture of you like holding your tummy, like, so hunky.

51:57.380 --> 51:58.820
I did something to that vein.

51:58.820 --> 52:03.300
I took my silverware out of the drawer and I put a piece of paper in there that said,

52:03.300 --> 52:04.740
I know you're taking my stuff.

52:04.740 --> 52:05.240
Stop.

52:05.940 --> 52:07.620
And that didn't work.

52:08.180 --> 52:08.680
Yeah.

52:09.220 --> 52:13.460
Cause if I saw that, I would feel like, well, now I'm going to become like more of a gentleman

52:13.460 --> 52:14.340
silverware thief.

52:14.340 --> 52:14.840
Yeah.

52:14.840 --> 52:16.500
It's more of a challenge.

52:16.500 --> 52:19.300
But if you just said like, oh, here's what you do.

52:19.300 --> 52:22.260
Put all the silverware back and say, you must need this more than I do.

52:23.220 --> 52:24.020
Oh yeah.

52:24.020 --> 52:24.520
Guilt.

52:25.780 --> 52:26.420
Very good.

52:26.420 --> 52:28.420
Now you're like the priest from Les Mis.

52:31.380 --> 52:33.540
Take my loaf of bread, Valjean.

52:33.540 --> 52:35.140
Take my half empty mustard.

52:36.660 --> 52:37.620
Cameron, I got something.

52:37.620 --> 52:40.260
But you forgot the half empty ketchup.

52:41.540 --> 52:42.820
I got something you could try.

52:44.100 --> 52:45.460
So here's what you're going to do.

52:45.460 --> 52:50.100
You're going to go into your fridge and get yourself a little jar of jelly.

52:53.140 --> 52:58.980
And then you're going to go to half of the handle and you're going to absolutely fucking

52:58.980 --> 53:00.260
coat it in jelly.

53:01.220 --> 53:01.720
Just half.

53:03.140 --> 53:07.700
And now it's important to come up with some sort of mnemonic device like, Cameron has

53:07.700 --> 53:10.740
an R in it and R is the first letter of right.

53:10.740 --> 53:16.260
And I can grab the right side of the handle because there's no jelly on it.

53:16.260 --> 53:18.340
And then they go for it.

53:19.140 --> 53:20.820
Full meaty paw grab.

53:21.620 --> 53:22.340
Oops.

53:22.340 --> 53:23.700
Sticky fingers.

53:23.700 --> 53:24.200
Yeah.

53:24.980 --> 53:27.380
Because of the jelly I put on it, idiot.

53:28.180 --> 53:32.820
And this important, Cameron, that you be in the kitchen all the time.

53:34.500 --> 53:37.780
This is an easily wipe awayable sort of trap.

53:37.780 --> 53:39.140
So you need to be ready.

53:39.140 --> 53:41.460
If they do that, you have to throw the jelly at them.

53:41.460 --> 53:41.960
Yeah.

53:42.500 --> 53:45.460
They can't come away un-jellyed from the experience.

53:45.460 --> 53:45.700
Yes.

53:45.700 --> 53:46.100
Right.

53:46.100 --> 53:46.820
So important.

53:46.820 --> 53:47.540
Does that help?

53:47.540 --> 53:48.180
Yes, it does.

53:48.180 --> 53:48.980
Thank you, Cameron.

53:48.980 --> 53:49.460
Good.

53:49.460 --> 53:49.940
Excellent.

53:53.860 --> 53:55.380
Should we queue up one more?

53:55.380 --> 53:55.880
Yes.

53:56.740 --> 54:01.380
Let's get Sidney E, row E, I guess, ten five.

54:01.940 --> 54:03.620
That may mean you're up on the balcony.

54:03.620 --> 54:04.980
Okay, it worked.

54:04.980 --> 54:06.260
Sidney, hello.

54:06.900 --> 54:07.380
Hello.

54:07.380 --> 54:08.100
What's your name?

54:08.100 --> 54:08.900
I'm Grace.

54:08.900 --> 54:09.380
Hi, Grace.

54:09.380 --> 54:10.660
Grace is leaning in the door frame.

54:10.660 --> 54:11.780
Even more casual.

54:11.780 --> 54:12.660
So many casual.

54:12.660 --> 54:13.220
Than Eli.

54:13.220 --> 54:15.380
As if Grace is waiting for an informant.

54:16.180 --> 54:16.420
Yes.

54:17.140 --> 54:17.620
What's your question?

54:17.620 --> 54:19.220
Grace, tell us the truth about Richard Nixon.

54:21.940 --> 54:22.440
Okay.

54:25.700 --> 54:27.700
Grace, your question, the prompt.

54:27.700 --> 54:30.340
How do I assert my dominance at the Home Depot?

54:33.460 --> 54:33.960
It's good.

54:33.960 --> 54:39.640
It's good.

54:39.640 --> 54:40.440
What do you got, Grace?

54:41.560 --> 54:42.120
Tell us more.

54:43.160 --> 54:44.920
I am an electrician.

54:44.920 --> 54:46.360
That is my day job.

54:46.360 --> 54:46.860
Excellent.

54:48.040 --> 54:49.080
Holy shit.

54:49.080 --> 54:51.480
How many electricians are in the house tonight?

54:52.840 --> 54:56.600
Yeah, so often I have to go to, you know, Home Depot or Lowe's

54:56.600 --> 55:01.000
and pick up random parts because men don't know how to order things.

55:01.000 --> 55:01.240
Sure.

55:02.040 --> 55:02.680
Am I right?

55:03.240 --> 55:03.720
No, you're right.

55:03.720 --> 55:05.720
I'm wrong, actually.

55:05.720 --> 55:08.120
I don't know where to get, like, a switch.

55:09.480 --> 55:09.980
Sure.

55:10.440 --> 55:11.400
The electrical aisle.

55:12.040 --> 55:13.720
Yeah, that'd be a good place to start, probably.

55:14.760 --> 55:17.800
When I moved into my house, I discovered that there was a light fixture

55:17.800 --> 55:19.080
that was just always on.

55:19.880 --> 55:23.720
And so I went to the Home Depot and I bought all the pieces to make a switch.

55:23.720 --> 55:25.640
And that was a year and a half ago.

55:26.360 --> 55:28.040
And still on.

55:28.040 --> 55:28.540
Yeah.

55:29.400 --> 55:31.960
Travis's house is a Motel 6, essentially, is what he said.

55:31.960 --> 55:32.460
Yeah.

55:33.320 --> 55:36.760
You probably just have your switch leg and your constant hot mixed up.

55:36.760 --> 55:38.280
You can ask somebody about that.

55:38.280 --> 55:42.840
That's the realization I came to as I bought the ability to do it.

55:43.800 --> 55:45.240
So what's your question?

55:45.240 --> 55:50.120
Well, my problem is I am, sadly, very adorable.

55:50.120 --> 55:59.240
So when I am in the Home Depot, it is very hard for people to just let me be

55:59.240 --> 56:00.360
and get my things.

56:01.000 --> 56:01.560
Yes.

56:01.560 --> 56:05.640
How do I assert that I am the boss of the trade goods?

56:06.360 --> 56:06.840
Do you know?

56:12.520 --> 56:14.280
Here's what I would suggest.

56:14.280 --> 56:17.560
If somebody comes up to you and they're really patronizing without saying a word,

56:18.360 --> 56:20.040
just rewire the whole store.

56:21.640 --> 56:22.600
It's good.

56:22.600 --> 56:23.160
Usually I just smile.

56:23.160 --> 56:25.320
While maintaining constant eye contact.

56:25.320 --> 56:25.560
Yeah.

56:25.560 --> 56:29.080
You just raise your hand like, and all the lights go out.

56:29.080 --> 56:36.440
I have this crystallized memory in my mind of at my old house, the first house I owned,

56:36.440 --> 56:37.560
it needed some work.

56:37.560 --> 56:42.040
And one of the things it needed to work with is that like the drippings that came out of

56:42.040 --> 56:48.280
the AC unit upstairs, the previous owners had to come down some PVC piping into a sink

56:48.280 --> 56:52.760
in the garage, just a plastic sink in the garage that emptied out into nothing.

56:54.280 --> 56:56.520
It emptied out onto the floor,

56:56.520 --> 57:02.040
which we, for a long time, just put a cooler under that we had to dump out every two days.

57:02.600 --> 57:05.240
But then I was like, I'm going to figure this shit out.

57:05.240 --> 57:08.760
I'm going to get some PVC pipe, I'm going to figure out how to cut it and make a thing.

57:08.760 --> 57:12.520
And so I went to the Home Depot and I was like, it took me 20 minutes to find where

57:12.520 --> 57:13.480
the PVC lives.

57:13.480 --> 57:18.760
And then I looked at all of the wonderful sprockets and joints as just employee after

57:18.760 --> 57:22.280
employee just looked at me and said, he knows what to do.

57:22.280 --> 57:26.840
He knows what to do and that's never been true.

57:26.840 --> 57:28.040
That's a good point, Griffin.

57:28.040 --> 57:33.640
When I'm at Home Depot or Lowe's or what have you, I have always adopted the most helpless

57:33.640 --> 57:34.600
look possible.

57:34.600 --> 57:35.080
Yeah.

57:35.080 --> 57:36.200
I cannot get assist.

57:36.200 --> 57:40.840
I'm wandering around with my hands in the air like, help me.

57:40.840 --> 57:43.720
I literally crawl on my hands and knees like a baby.

57:44.440 --> 57:49.320
I supplicate myself in front of the vest wearers, hoping that one of them will shine their light

57:49.320 --> 57:54.520
on me.

57:54.520 --> 57:57.640
Can you wear a shirt that says, my name is Grayson, I'm crazy about wires.

57:59.960 --> 58:04.600
Or clothes that you've made out of lights and wires and robot parts and you walk in

58:04.600 --> 58:05.080
and be like.

58:05.080 --> 58:06.360
That's very good.

58:06.360 --> 58:07.320
That's for Christmas.

58:08.280 --> 58:08.600
Yes.

58:08.600 --> 58:12.600
Can you dress in more of a steampunk fashion that says, I know about technology.

58:14.760 --> 58:17.400
I mean, that'll help.

58:17.400 --> 58:20.920
Could you, no, actually, I don't.

58:20.920 --> 58:24.840
I usually just make eye contact and make a point to not smile.

58:25.400 --> 58:26.920
That's good.

58:26.920 --> 58:30.600
That'll get you out of a lot of social situations, I feel like.

58:30.600 --> 58:33.400
It sounds like you're better at intimidating people than we are.

58:33.400 --> 58:33.880
Absolutely.

58:34.840 --> 58:38.920
We'll come to you for advice the next time that we need assistance.

58:38.920 --> 58:40.680
You lost me at make eye contact.

58:43.000 --> 58:44.040
With a person?

58:44.040 --> 58:44.680
No.

58:44.680 --> 58:45.480
Are you sure?

58:45.480 --> 58:47.400
Maybe with a dog on a good day.

58:49.720 --> 58:50.280
Does that help?

58:51.320 --> 58:52.600
Tremendously.

58:52.600 --> 58:53.000
It's okay.

58:53.560 --> 58:53.880
Thank you.

58:59.240 --> 59:01.640
Over here, yes, you've been waiting for a long time.

59:01.640 --> 59:02.040
Hello.

59:03.320 --> 59:03.800
What's up?

59:03.800 --> 59:04.360
What's your name?

59:05.960 --> 59:06.840
My name is Jared.

59:06.840 --> 59:07.640
Just making sure.

59:07.640 --> 59:08.440
Jared.

59:08.440 --> 59:14.040
Jared, I just want you to know, I saw that when we complimented Grace on standing cool

59:14.040 --> 59:15.960
in the doorway, I watched Jared go...

59:18.760 --> 59:20.200
Stand even cooler.

59:20.200 --> 59:22.920
This is the, Jared is the most chill position.

59:22.920 --> 59:25.160
Jared's at about 55 degrees.

59:26.360 --> 59:32.040
Yeah, he's doing the thing from Smooth Criminal where they nailed his shoes to the ground.

59:32.040 --> 59:33.080
Jared, what's up?

59:34.440 --> 59:35.320
Not much, guys.

59:36.520 --> 59:37.800
Cool, cool.

59:37.800 --> 59:39.240
Good hang, Griffin.

59:40.120 --> 59:43.560
Your prompt was, how can I stop being a picky eater?

59:43.560 --> 59:46.040
And I just really want to dial into this because...

59:46.840 --> 59:47.800
So what do you eat?

59:48.680 --> 59:50.200
Hey, front-deer buddy, what are you into?

59:51.400 --> 59:58.520
I do like a lot of foods, but there's some specific foods that I can't handle and it

59:58.520 --> 01:00:01.080
ruled out a lot of meals for me.

01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:02.440
That doesn't sound like a picky eater.

01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:04.040
That sounds like everyone.

01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:04.920
No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:06.520
Give us some of the categories, Jared.

01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:12.040
Unless that pickiness is like grain, dairy, and meat.

01:00:12.040 --> 01:00:14.600
And anything that casts a shadow, I am...

01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:17.560
Get right up on that microphone, Jared.

01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:18.280
What's your faves?

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:20.280
My favorite foods?

01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:20.680
Sure.

01:00:20.680 --> 01:00:21.640
Or the more fearful?

01:00:21.640 --> 01:00:23.640
No, just what are some of your favorite things?

01:00:25.240 --> 01:00:27.080
How do you feel about raindrops on roofs?

01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:29.720
Okay, we're gonna let Jared talk.

01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:33.720
Jared, just my question, ignore them.

01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:34.920
What don't you like?

01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:36.600
Soups.

01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:38.440
That's good actually.

01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:40.680
Come on, you lost me already.

01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:50.600
Beans, tomatoes, onions, I feel like my fiancee could tell me a lot of things.

01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:51.320
I will say...

01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:51.960
Seafood.

01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:55.000
Seafood is so broad though.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.040
That's so many things.

01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:59.800
You know the ocean, very large, covers most of the world.

01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:01.640
Any other big ones?

01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:04.360
Broccoli, a lot of vegetables.

01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:11.160
Okay, so when you said some foods, you meant most.

01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:13.080
Yeah, a lot of things you don't like.

01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:15.240
Here's the thing, I'm with you on soup.

01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:16.120
What a waste.

01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:17.560
What a waste of calories.

01:01:17.560 --> 01:01:18.600
Salty water, gross.

01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:19.800
Soup is a drink.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.800
Oh no, I lose them.

01:01:23.800 --> 01:01:26.840
I expect my wife to just rappel onto the stage like,

01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:28.440
is somebody talking shit about soup?

01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:33.720
Except for a real chunky soup or a stew.

01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:36.840
Oh, fuck with a stew.

01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:38.360
Stop, everyone be quiet.

01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:40.360
That was the weirdest experience of my life.

01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:43.320
It sounded like an exact clump of 30 people.

01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:47.240
When Travis said stew, there were like a club.

01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:47.960
It's right here, what the fuck?

01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:49.400
There's like a stew club.

01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:53.080
Okay, there's like 20 people here sitting together that love stew.

01:01:53.080 --> 01:01:53.960
What's happening?

01:01:54.760 --> 01:01:56.840
Are you in a really specific club?

01:01:58.360 --> 01:01:59.400
The stew crew?

01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:01.960
Very good, Travis, very good.

01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:06.760
But one time, a very long time ago,

01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:08.200
there was an episode, Biggest Loser,

01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:09.880
where there was a boy named Bingo,

01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:11.320
and he had two eyes in his name.

01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:16.280
And Bingo, his mom wanted him to eat vegetables.

01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:23.720
So she blended them up and shoved them into meatloaf and hid them like a secret.

01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:27.560
And then he ate it and he hates vegetables so bad.

01:02:27.560 --> 01:02:31.000
And then she was like, well, Bingo, Bingo, guess what?

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.480
You just ate a bunch of vegetables I hid in there.

01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:37.320
And this 10-year-old boy looked up at his mom and went...

01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:41.880
And she was like, didn't it taste good?

01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:45.080
And he said, don't ever do that again.

01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:49.720
So you could try that, just blend them on up.

01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:51.320
But then shit, then it's soup.

01:02:53.480 --> 01:02:58.040
When I was a kid, my mom told me this fish was chicken.

01:02:58.040 --> 01:02:58.840
All right.

01:02:58.840 --> 01:03:00.280
Oh yeah, I'm gonna do it.

01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:00.840
I'm gonna do it.

01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:02.680
Were you eating it like orange on silvers?

01:03:02.680 --> 01:03:04.520
Because that confuses me too sometimes.

01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:06.920
There's lots of food.

01:03:06.920 --> 01:03:10.600
I feel like if there's like, even if you don't like half of food,

01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:13.400
the other half is still like pretty good, a lot.

01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:15.640
I'm alive to this point.

01:03:15.640 --> 01:03:16.600
So yeah, sure.

01:03:18.280 --> 01:03:19.400
You know, life is short.

01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:20.360
Eat what you like.

01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:22.360
Everybody has a salad point, Jared.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:24.120
Everybody has a salad point.

01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:27.080
And that's the point at which you're hungry enough to eat salad.

01:03:27.080 --> 01:03:32.120
And my problem a lot of the time is I wouldn't let myself get to salad point.

01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:33.000
You know what I mean?

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.960
I'd get to like hamburger point or cereal point,

01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:38.360
but I wouldn't let myself get to salad point.

01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:42.520
And then one day his arm got pinned between a rock and a mountain face.

01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:50.120
And after 128 hours, I would eat a salad if it would free me from my rock.

01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:53.640
He was trying to cut his arm off with a bowl full of salad.

01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:55.640
And he was like, I don't eat it.

01:03:55.640 --> 01:03:57.080
I don't eat it.

01:03:58.680 --> 01:03:59.640
Does that help?

01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:02.440
Kind of.

01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:03.080
Thank you, Jared.

01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:05.480
Tough, but fair.

01:04:05.480 --> 01:04:05.880
All right.

01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:07.720
Our final audience question.

01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:08.040
Hello.

01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:10.520
Hello.

01:04:10.520 --> 01:04:11.400
What is your name?

01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:12.040
Sydney.

01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:12.600
Sydney, hello.

01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:13.400
What is your question?

01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:22.040
So I am an actor and I have recently branched into narrating audio books as part of the hustle.

01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:28.440
And I've been mostly doing YA fantasy dystopian novels.

01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:29.240
And that's been great.

01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:30.120
All of them.

01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:30.680
All of them.

01:04:30.680 --> 01:04:31.240
All of them.

01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:32.120
All of the books.

01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:44.920
And I've started to be approached by authors of erotica novels who pay a lot of freaking money.

01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:45.480
Cool.

01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:46.200
Yeah.

01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:47.800
And I'm totally fine with doing it.

01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:49.160
Are you just bragging or do you have a question?

01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:50.360
I don't know.

01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:51.800
I don't know.

01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:57.880
My question is, if I'm an actor auditioning for a Shakespeare festival, I don't want the

01:04:57.880 --> 01:05:03.320
director to Google my name and say Diddling the Duke by Sydney Fulmer.

01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:05.880
So I need a pseudonym.

01:05:06.680 --> 01:05:08.440
And wondering if you guys would help me out.

01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:10.680
That is a tough line of work.

01:05:10.680 --> 01:05:17.160
I once, to help out my friend Chuck Tingle, I once read the book Slammed in the Butt by

01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:18.920
my handsome laundry detergent pod.

01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:23.160
And to my wife, I read it to my wife, I should have mentioned that earlier.

01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:27.240
That's tough, but fun, so I envy you.

01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:30.520
And I guess this is my way of saying, what about Maude Horny?

01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:34.280
That's pretty good.

01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:37.080
My top one right now is Anita Dixon.

01:05:37.080 --> 01:05:37.480
Okay.

01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:38.760
Yeah, I mean that's a little.

01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:51.880
You know, here's what I'll say, Sydney, is I think we've all kind of been in this position.

01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:56.280
Like, you know, I'd love to be an actor, but I'm worried that a potential director would

01:05:56.280 --> 01:06:02.280
Google me and found out I did a dumb podcast with my brothers, which is, I would say in

01:06:02.280 --> 01:06:03.560
a lot of ways, worse.

01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:04.840
Yeah, yeah.

01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:07.400
Or that his TV show only lasted six episodes.

01:06:07.400 --> 01:06:10.120
Yeah.

01:06:10.120 --> 01:06:11.320
So far.

01:06:11.320 --> 01:06:12.360
Yeah, who knows?

01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:15.160
Don't torture yourselves.

01:06:15.160 --> 01:06:15.960
No, that's nothing.

01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:22.520
It's weird, I have the opposite situation where I am widely known as a narrator for

01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:28.680
sexual audio books, but I don't want fans of that work to know that I do a podcast with

01:06:28.680 --> 01:06:33.000
my brothers, which is why my real name is Jeremy Badbone.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:38.440
Wait, hold on, that would be the worst erotic pendant, Badbone.

01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:40.040
It's just my fucking name, dude.

01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:45.720
And my thing is, I don't want people to know that I'm related to the guy that eats

01:06:45.720 --> 01:06:47.720
amiibos for sexual gratification.

01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:51.240
It's a my thing.

01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:51.480
True.

01:06:55.880 --> 01:06:57.240
I want to end on that joke.

01:06:57.240 --> 01:06:58.040
Does that help?

01:06:58.840 --> 01:06:59.400
Yes, thank you.

01:06:59.400 --> 01:07:00.360
Okay, cool.

01:07:00.360 --> 01:07:07.960
It was, you have a very skewed view of what I do as my fucking artist.

01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:09.640
We can bring the house lights back down.

01:07:09.640 --> 01:07:14.840
Yes, thank you so much Salt Lake City for being so fun and welcoming and kind.

01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:18.920
You're the best.

01:07:18.920 --> 01:07:21.640
Make them go away, please, they're terrifying me.

01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:26.520
I'm just going to close my eyes until they're gone because I'm getting real freaked out.

01:07:26.520 --> 01:07:27.880
Thank you for coming to the show.

01:07:27.880 --> 01:07:29.160
We really appreciate you.

01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:32.440
Thank you to Paul Sabourin.

01:07:32.440 --> 01:07:33.240
Please turn off the house lights.

01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:34.840
Please not do anything.

01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:37.880
Paul Sabourin over there on the ones and twos.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:40.200
Make sure you check out Paul and Storm.

01:07:40.200 --> 01:07:41.880
Mixmaster Paul we call him sometimes.

01:07:41.880 --> 01:07:43.800
Mixmaster Paul, Paul and Storm is his band.

01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:44.760
Go listen to all their music.

01:07:44.760 --> 01:07:47.000
It's on Spotify so you can get it for free.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:47.800
You're welcome, Paul.

01:07:50.280 --> 01:07:54.280
Thank you to Sawbones and Schmanners who crushed it.

01:07:54.280 --> 01:08:04.040
Thank you to our families, our dad, our daddy.

01:08:07.160 --> 01:08:07.640
Thank you.

01:08:08.440 --> 01:08:10.520
Thank you to Amanda and Alice.

01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:15.080
Yeah, for helping us out and thank you to this beautiful venue whose name we would

01:08:15.080 --> 01:08:17.640
certainly goof up if we tried to say it out loud.

01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:20.360
So everyone count of one, two, three.

01:08:20.360 --> 01:08:20.840
Thank you.

01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:24.280
That's it.

01:08:24.280 --> 01:08:25.320
You got it, I guess.

01:08:25.320 --> 01:08:26.440
You live here.

01:08:26.440 --> 01:08:30.680
Also, thank you Caleb Cleveland for the absolutely beautiful poster.

01:08:30.680 --> 01:08:31.320
Wonderful posters.

01:08:31.320 --> 01:08:32.520
Yeah, there may be some more in the lobby if you didn't get one.

01:08:32.520 --> 01:08:33.560
There may still be some more.

01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:37.480
Thank you to John Roderick and the Long Winters for these theme songs.

01:08:37.480 --> 01:08:39.640
It's a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:39.880
Yes.

01:08:40.680 --> 01:08:44.280
Thank you Maximumfun.org, our podcast home.

01:08:45.240 --> 01:08:48.760
We are, we're not going to be hanging out after the show because we are going to go

01:08:48.760 --> 01:08:51.560
home to our fam- well, back to the hotel where our families are.

01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:53.160
Yes, I know.

01:08:53.160 --> 01:08:54.760
Because we love them.

01:08:54.760 --> 01:08:55.080
We do.

01:08:55.080 --> 01:08:57.240
We're great people and we're tired.

01:08:57.240 --> 01:08:59.080
We love you too, but in a different way.

01:08:59.080 --> 01:09:03.240
Yeah, seriously, we've never- we had no idea what to expect playing here because we've

01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:05.240
never played here before and you all have seriously been amazing.

01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:06.040
Thank you all so much.

01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:09.400
Here is-

01:09:09.400 --> 01:09:15.480
Here is a final Yahoo that was sent in by Alayna.

01:09:15.480 --> 01:09:16.280
Thank you Alayna.

01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:19.160
It's Yahoo Answers user Richard D. who asks,

01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:26.040
is Long John Silver's generally a good fish experience?

01:09:26.040 --> 01:09:29.800
He's just a mackerel.

01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:30.920
I'm Travis Mackerel.

01:09:30.920 --> 01:09:31.880
I'm Griffin Mackerel.

01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:33.000
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:39.720
Kiss your dad's square on the lips.

01:09:54.680 --> 01:09:56.600
Maximumfun.org.

01:09:56.600 --> 01:09:57.640
Comedy and culture.

01:09:57.640 --> 01:09:58.760
Artist owned.

01:09:58.760 --> 01:09:59.720
Listener supported.

01:09:59.720 --> 01:10:05.720
But welcome everyone to the live wrestling spectacular in Los Angeles.

01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:10.440
So far the world's most boring wrestling podcast has been destroying the competition.

01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:14.200
Isn't there anyone who can save us from this travesty?

01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:16.840
Wait, could it be?

01:10:16.840 --> 01:10:19.720
It's Tights and Fights, the perfect wrestling podcast.

01:10:21.080 --> 01:10:25.720
Tights and Fights is here to save us from the monotony of boring wrestling podcasts

01:10:25.720 --> 01:10:27.400
with hilarious conversations.

01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:30.040
Woke trips through the history of wrestling.

01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:33.960
And joke about the finer points of people wearing spandex.

01:10:38.840 --> 01:10:39.960
What a match!

01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:42.840
And the Tights and Fights podcast will be back every week.

01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:47.240
Thursdays on Maximumfun.org or wherever you get podcasts.

01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:59.560
Please, these hosts have families.
