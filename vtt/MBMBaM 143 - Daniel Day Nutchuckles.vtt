00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:31.120
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:31.120 --> 00:45.120
It's a new craze, and good girls do you wanna just say, hey, I wanna, just say, hey, I wanna.

00:45.120 --> 00:48.800
Welcome, my brother, my brother, and me to an advice show for the modern era,

00:49.440 --> 00:55.840
and we on that time creep. If by we on that time creep you mean that this episode is going to be

00:55.840 --> 01:01.520
hurried and rushed because I overslept by exactly one Gregorian hour,

01:02.080 --> 01:07.440
then yeah, that's an accurate thing to say. I actually sprung forward two days,

01:07.440 --> 01:13.680
and I had to run back to catch this episode. I also don't understand how time works.

01:13.680 --> 01:18.320
Or introductions, either of you, so that's a great.

01:18.320 --> 01:26.320
I actually introduced myself, but I did it in the hour that we lost, so no one will ever hear it.

01:26.320 --> 01:30.560
I wish that that's how it worked. I wish that literally it was just an hour of time

01:30.560 --> 01:34.960
edited out of the universe. It was for me last night trying to go to bed,

01:34.960 --> 01:41.280
and it's like, ah, two, that seems, oops, three, nope, bad, did it bad.

01:41.920 --> 01:45.840
You know, any crimes you commit in the witching hour, which is what it's called,

01:45.840 --> 01:53.040
you get away with, but then it comes back to haunt you in the reverse witching hour,

01:53.040 --> 01:57.920
which you have to live over twice. So just keep that in mind.

01:57.920 --> 02:01.360
Can we just stop it?

02:02.400 --> 02:03.680
It's really fucking silly.

02:03.680 --> 02:06.560
Completely made up bullshit, is that what you mean?

02:06.560 --> 02:12.640
It really rams home the fact that time itself and our measurement of it is absolute horse shit.

02:12.640 --> 02:14.960
Not just time, right? All measurements.

02:14.960 --> 02:16.240
All measurements are made up.

02:16.240 --> 02:22.000
All measurements. Money, fucking, it's a, you know, man, the man, right?

02:22.560 --> 02:26.720
Like business and politics, and like, Wall Street's not looking out for me,

02:26.720 --> 02:31.040
and my bank, no thank you. My bank, I don't want it.

02:31.760 --> 02:34.480
You know what I'm talking about? Like, savings and loans.

02:34.480 --> 02:35.600
Yeah, right, exactly.

02:35.600 --> 02:38.480
I don't know what's going on.

02:38.480 --> 02:41.680
The government man is taking your time away, and he eats it.

02:41.680 --> 02:46.080
Is this Obama's fault? Is Obama hoarding my time?

02:46.080 --> 02:48.160
Do you know where that hour you lose goes?

02:49.360 --> 02:54.400
It goes straight to the 1%, and they go out on a yacht, and they spend all the poor people time.

02:55.040 --> 02:58.640
That's like that Justin Timberlake movie where they have the time in their arm,

02:58.640 --> 03:00.240
and when it runs out, they die.

03:00.240 --> 03:01.760
Where they keep looking at their watches.

03:02.640 --> 03:07.840
And then Justin Timberlake is like, I'm going to instill a change in this unfair world,

03:07.840 --> 03:10.480
and he does it with the power of his song and dance.

03:10.480 --> 03:12.960
No, you haven't seen it, have you?

03:12.960 --> 03:14.240
I did not see the film.

03:15.040 --> 03:17.280
It's called Time to Sing and Dance.

03:19.680 --> 03:21.280
Man, his new album's not very good.

03:23.840 --> 03:25.920
Welcome to our pop music review cast.

03:25.920 --> 03:27.680
Welcome to a music show.

03:27.680 --> 03:29.680
Did you guys introduce yourself? Did you say your names?

03:29.680 --> 03:32.400
I'm still Travis.

03:35.680 --> 03:38.720
I am now and will always be Travis.

03:38.720 --> 03:40.400
This is an advice show, so let's-

03:40.400 --> 03:41.200
I'm Griffin.

03:41.200 --> 03:41.840
Let's do that.

03:42.400 --> 03:43.120
We're brothers.

03:45.040 --> 03:49.200
I'm in college and recently had my first one night stand.

03:50.080 --> 03:52.880
We were both pretty drunk and pretty-

03:52.880 --> 03:55.600
Stop it. Stop it. You creepo.

03:55.600 --> 03:59.840
Dear Penthouse, I never thought it would happen to me.

03:59.840 --> 04:01.440
I had sex with a girl.

04:02.240 --> 04:03.440
It was great.

04:03.440 --> 04:05.600
Pretty drunk and it was pretty clean.

04:05.600 --> 04:08.240
Stop it. What is this yo-yo creepy voice?

04:08.240 --> 04:09.040
Stop doing it.

04:09.040 --> 04:10.720
One night only thing.

04:10.720 --> 04:15.840
We parted without exchanging numbers or even adding each other on Facebook.

04:18.400 --> 04:21.600
Problem is I'm going to a party in the next few weeks

04:21.600 --> 04:23.040
and I know the girl will be there.

04:23.600 --> 04:26.800
I really want to go because it's a good friend's party

04:26.800 --> 04:29.760
and I don't want to miss it just to avoid her,

04:29.760 --> 04:33.840
but I really don't want to act when I see her.

04:33.840 --> 04:35.440
Do I just act like nothing happened?

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
Do I acknowledge it in some way?

04:38.000 --> 04:39.920
How do I stop it from being awkward?

04:39.920 --> 04:42.000
And that's from Awkward in Adelaide.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.200
Awkward in Adelaide.

04:43.760 --> 04:48.640
Imagine my surprise to find that casual sex among acquaintances

04:48.640 --> 04:50.560
can cause complications.

04:50.560 --> 04:51.520
What do you know?

04:51.520 --> 04:53.200
Who could have seen this coming?

04:54.320 --> 04:59.520
Did you not see the two films that were literally identical shot for shot

04:59.520 --> 05:01.600
that came out in like the same week?

05:01.600 --> 05:05.280
Friends with Benefits and then the other one that was like Friends with Benefits.

05:05.280 --> 05:08.000
Mm-hmm. Acquaintances with Bonuses.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.240
Friends with Dental, I think is what it is.

05:13.040 --> 05:14.320
Yeah, this sucks.

05:14.320 --> 05:16.160
Also, why do you think we would know?

05:16.160 --> 05:17.040
Yeah, man.

05:17.040 --> 05:17.540
Yeah.

05:18.960 --> 05:24.400
Dear my Bim Bam, I don't know the proper way to polish all of my ivory.

05:25.760 --> 05:26.800
I don't know either.

05:26.800 --> 05:27.840
Regata Magazine.

05:28.400 --> 05:29.360
I mean you...

05:30.720 --> 05:33.680
Okay, I think that if you are cool,

05:33.680 --> 05:38.240
it is safe to assume that this person is also cool.

05:38.800 --> 05:42.960
There's no reason to attach or I think maybe you can project

05:43.680 --> 05:48.480
some sort of emotional connection that this person had or didn't have.

05:48.480 --> 05:50.480
Like I don't think you need to assume.

05:51.440 --> 05:54.400
They wrote into an internet advice podcast though to add

05:54.400 --> 05:58.000
this is how concerned they are when the cool ship sailed

05:58.000 --> 06:00.320
and then was boarded by pirates and burned into the ocean.

06:00.320 --> 06:04.000
No, I'm not saying that this person is aboard the SS Cool.

06:04.000 --> 06:09.520
I'm saying that if they're worrying about it and if they're worrying about it,

06:09.520 --> 06:12.960
they're assuming that the other person is more emotionally invested than they are.

06:12.960 --> 06:17.120
And considering that they've made no effort to contact you,

06:17.120 --> 06:19.920
maybe the dick wasn't that good for them.

06:22.000 --> 06:22.500
Wow.

06:23.600 --> 06:24.400
Justin.

06:25.280 --> 06:29.520
So I guess what Justin's point is that you're really bad at sex.

06:29.520 --> 06:33.680
Maybe the more pressing concern is that you have not had any repeat business

06:33.680 --> 06:34.880
to the dick store.

06:34.880 --> 06:37.440
Maybe is the thing that you should worry about.

06:37.440 --> 06:41.040
Dear my bim-bam, there's this guy who did not give it to me right

06:41.040 --> 06:42.480
and then I'm gonna see him at a party.

06:42.480 --> 06:43.440
Do I tell him?

06:43.440 --> 06:44.400
No, you don't.

06:44.400 --> 06:45.440
Please don't tell that man.

06:45.440 --> 06:46.800
You tell everyone else.

06:46.800 --> 06:50.160
Tell everyone else and warn them that he's not gonna give you the dick right.

06:50.960 --> 06:52.000
This seems...

06:52.000 --> 06:59.120
This seems... I think that we foster a kind of a rapport with our community,

06:59.120 --> 07:03.280
which usually, typically, it does not involve us making fun of their dicks.

07:03.280 --> 07:04.320
Okay, fair enough.

07:04.320 --> 07:04.880
You can get...

07:04.880 --> 07:06.000
Your balls are weird.

07:06.560 --> 07:09.840
Why don't you go to extremechains.com and get a bigger dick to put on your dick.

07:09.840 --> 07:10.960
Just put it on top of it.

07:10.960 --> 07:12.560
It's like a dick suit for your dick.

07:12.560 --> 07:13.440
Like Dick Kighton.

07:14.560 --> 07:19.920
Dick Kighton was the greatest college football coach this country has ever seen.

07:19.920 --> 07:22.240
And I will take that to my grave.

07:22.240 --> 07:24.480
Dick Kighton, I love you.

07:24.480 --> 07:26.320
You're like a second father to me.

07:26.320 --> 07:28.000
Go blue and orange.

07:28.560 --> 07:29.600
I think what you definitely...

07:31.520 --> 07:33.840
You definitely don't want to act like it didn't happen.

07:34.640 --> 07:35.280
That's...

07:35.280 --> 07:37.680
That seems awfully cruel to give her the,

07:37.680 --> 07:38.960
oh, do I know you?

07:38.960 --> 07:40.080
Like, that's bad.

07:40.080 --> 07:42.480
That's what Dick Kighton would call shutting in the punt.

07:42.480 --> 07:51.600
The problem with your unsatisfying lovemaking is that you did not shunt it in the punt.

07:52.800 --> 07:54.160
That's what she was waiting for.

07:54.160 --> 07:55.520
That's like her favorite thing.

07:55.520 --> 07:56.880
It's 2013, man.

07:57.680 --> 07:59.360
Everybody's shunting in the punt.

07:59.360 --> 08:02.320
You just assume that there should be some punt shunting.

08:03.120 --> 08:04.640
One with hope, right?

08:04.640 --> 08:05.520
Between friends.

08:05.520 --> 08:12.640
It's such an innocuous phrase until viewed through the lens of coitus.

08:12.640 --> 08:13.680
I think that you...

08:13.680 --> 08:15.440
I think that you should not worry about it.

08:15.440 --> 08:16.960
You gotta be confident.

08:16.960 --> 08:17.680
Cool and confident.

08:17.680 --> 08:19.120
This person's giving you no reason.

08:19.120 --> 08:24.160
If they were calling and, you know, there was some relationship that had ended here,

08:24.160 --> 08:24.800
I could see it.

08:24.800 --> 08:30.640
But like, you had casual one night stand sex and no one wanted to reach out afterwards.

08:31.680 --> 08:34.720
Or maybe she was waiting for you too and she was heartbroken that you didn't.

08:34.720 --> 08:38.960
There's really no way of knowing until you just go to the party and find out.

08:38.960 --> 08:43.360
And maybe while you're there, ask her if the dick was good.

08:43.360 --> 08:45.200
Just I'm saying, just ask.

08:45.200 --> 08:47.280
Give her a comment card to fill out.

08:48.480 --> 08:49.120
God.

08:49.120 --> 08:53.600
I wanted to let you get back to the party, but if you could just take this brief survey.

08:53.600 --> 08:54.800
Let me get my clipboard.

08:54.800 --> 08:55.600
Bit of advice.

08:55.600 --> 08:56.400
Bit of advice.

08:56.400 --> 09:02.400
Give it on a scale of one to ten because one to five leaves so little room for specificity.

09:02.400 --> 09:06.720
Because, you know, like there's such a big difference between a seven and an eight.

09:06.720 --> 09:11.440
But if it's a five scale, I'm just saying that on your sex comment cards, make it one to ten people.

09:11.440 --> 09:13.680
I actually use a 100 point scale.

09:13.680 --> 09:19.200
So the convert the conversion over to Metacritic is more like it's more equal.

09:19.200 --> 09:19.760
You know what I mean?

09:19.760 --> 09:20.320
That is nice.

09:20.960 --> 09:22.080
You have an opportunity.

09:22.080 --> 09:24.480
You might be able to turn this into a two night stand.

09:24.480 --> 09:27.200
And then how I met your mother.

09:27.200 --> 09:28.160
And then you're married.

09:28.720 --> 09:29.680
Now I know what you're thinking.

09:30.960 --> 09:32.080
What is he thinking?

09:32.080 --> 09:34.560
He's thinking, I thought this was a casual one night stand,

09:34.560 --> 09:38.160
but it could be a casual like one thousand night stand.

09:38.160 --> 09:41.200
Maybe you could just casually keep having sex and then casually

09:41.200 --> 09:44.000
have kids together and casually grow old together.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.160
Just keep it totally casually.

09:46.160 --> 09:48.400
Get on each other's health insurance.

09:48.400 --> 09:51.200
Casually die side by side like in the end of the notebook.

09:52.400 --> 09:53.440
Where are you going to bury me?

09:53.440 --> 09:53.920
I don't know.

09:56.080 --> 09:57.360
I don't want to get tied down.

09:57.360 --> 09:58.960
Make a big deal out of this.

09:58.960 --> 10:00.320
I'm just dying next to you.

10:00.320 --> 10:04.880
We're just getting we have two graves that happen to be adjacent.

10:04.880 --> 10:06.720
It doesn't mean anything.

10:06.720 --> 10:09.360
Listen, you're free to die next to somebody else too.

10:09.360 --> 10:10.000
If you want.

10:10.000 --> 10:10.960
I am too.

10:10.960 --> 10:11.680
It's free.

10:11.680 --> 10:12.240
It's open.

10:12.800 --> 10:13.760
It's easy.

10:13.760 --> 10:14.240
Breezy.

10:14.240 --> 10:14.720
Beautiful.

10:16.160 --> 10:17.120
Yes, absolutely.

10:19.680 --> 10:20.240
How about this one?

10:20.240 --> 10:21.280
It's sent by Ira Ray.

10:22.080 --> 10:23.360
Are you Ira Ray?

10:24.640 --> 10:25.360
That was good.

10:25.360 --> 10:26.800
You were in good form today.

10:26.800 --> 10:27.040
Thanks.

10:27.040 --> 10:29.680
It's by Yahoo Answers user Rose who asks.

10:31.120 --> 10:35.040
Any ideas on how a dog should carry the rings for a simple beach wedding?

10:36.400 --> 10:39.440
My fiancee and I are planning to have a simple beach wedding.

10:39.440 --> 10:42.160
We love dogs and want our dog to be the ring bearer.

10:42.160 --> 10:45.440
I'm just looking for ways she can carry the rings without using a pillow.

10:45.440 --> 10:48.160
I really want to put the rings in a ball or something.

10:48.160 --> 10:52.800
Has anyone heard or seen how a ball, stick, rope can be used for this purpose?

10:52.800 --> 10:54.240
Any other creative ideas?

10:54.240 --> 10:55.360
Thank you for your input.

10:55.360 --> 10:57.920
How big are your dog's nipples?

10:57.920 --> 10:58.880
Oh, good question.

10:59.440 --> 11:00.160
Bad question.

11:00.160 --> 11:01.520
The worst question.

11:01.520 --> 11:03.440
The anti-question is what it is.

11:03.440 --> 11:06.160
Have your dog eat the rings and then shit them out in front of you.

11:06.800 --> 11:07.760
A little bit, everybody.

11:10.400 --> 11:11.200
One second.

11:11.200 --> 11:11.760
Don't look at her.

11:11.760 --> 11:12.880
If you look at her, she won't do it.

11:12.880 --> 11:15.200
I'm giving you a sneak preview of Hangover 3.

11:15.200 --> 11:16.720
Just everybody relax.

11:16.720 --> 11:18.720
This is total nonsense.

11:18.720 --> 11:26.960
We love dogs and we love farcical sitcom scenarios.

11:26.960 --> 11:31.840
There's just so many fucking variables.

11:31.840 --> 11:38.000
You spent so much time, because I know, because I'm deep in the shit of planning this special

11:38.000 --> 11:42.720
day, so much time and money, and then you're going to leave one of the more important

11:42.720 --> 11:48.240
aspects of the ceremony completely to chance to your stupid ass dog.

11:48.240 --> 11:48.740
Yep.

11:50.000 --> 11:53.840
This is, like, Chase and I have had a couple different conversations about this.

11:53.840 --> 11:56.000
We've opted out of Flower Girl.

11:56.800 --> 12:00.160
We've opted out of, like, Ring Bear for this very reason.

12:00.160 --> 12:06.240
When have you ever been to a wedding and seen either a dog or a child just seem super excited

12:06.240 --> 12:07.120
to be participating?

12:07.120 --> 12:14.160
Or when have you ever left a wedding where a child, or Christ forbid a dog, carries the

12:14.160 --> 12:18.560
rings down the aisle and after the wedding you were like, man, that thing went off without

12:18.560 --> 12:19.040
a hitch.

12:19.040 --> 12:19.440
Right?

12:19.440 --> 12:20.320
That was a ship.

12:21.360 --> 12:23.360
That train was running right on time.

12:23.360 --> 12:26.080
They were definitely not crying or peeing on anything.

12:26.640 --> 12:32.800
They got those rings down to their intended target in a quick, efficient, and honestly

12:32.800 --> 12:34.080
professional manner.

12:34.080 --> 12:38.320
And their mother definitely didn't have to carry them down the aisle and make it seem

12:38.320 --> 12:39.840
just like child torture.

12:39.840 --> 12:44.000
Yeah, when have they even made it to the end of their job?

12:44.000 --> 12:49.360
Even if they had done really shitty, I've never seen a child make it all the way down

12:49.360 --> 12:50.160
the aisle.

12:50.160 --> 12:52.160
They always have to, like, fucking lie down.

12:53.360 --> 12:54.960
Take a nap right there.

12:54.960 --> 12:58.400
And then you gotta wait for half an hour until they're done with their nap while everyone

12:58.400 --> 12:59.920
stays really quiet.

12:59.920 --> 13:01.360
It's not your wedding anymore.

13:02.560 --> 13:03.520
It's Stevie's wedding.

13:03.520 --> 13:04.400
It's Stevie's nap.

13:05.280 --> 13:08.640
And then Stevie has to get married to the dog that's the ring bearer.

13:08.640 --> 13:10.880
Yeah, you're having your wedding on the beach.

13:10.880 --> 13:14.080
That in and of itself is already a high risk.

13:14.720 --> 13:15.840
High seagull.

13:15.840 --> 13:17.520
Yeah, that's it.

13:17.520 --> 13:18.240
That's it.

13:18.240 --> 13:24.080
A human being, it can close, they can retract their fingers over the rings when a seagull

13:24.080 --> 13:26.160
comes up hunting.

13:26.160 --> 13:28.240
A dog has no recourse.

13:28.240 --> 13:29.760
A dog will just sit there.

13:29.760 --> 13:31.600
That would be an epic battle.

13:31.600 --> 13:34.240
Ring bearer dog versus flock of seagulls.

13:34.240 --> 13:39.920
This is the biggest problem with dogs that we've dulled their instincts against seagulls

13:39.920 --> 13:41.520
of protecting rings.

13:41.520 --> 13:43.920
So you're saying you need to get a wolf to be your ring bearer.

13:43.920 --> 13:49.600
When dog wolves, when wolves came over on the boat from Egypt, they were originally

13:49.600 --> 13:56.480
bred to defend rings from avians, more pterodactyls in those days.

13:56.480 --> 13:58.960
But that was the original use of dogs.

13:58.960 --> 14:04.240
And we have just beaten that out of them with years of potty training and beatings.

14:05.840 --> 14:09.680
So I think what you gotta do is you gotta double up.

14:09.680 --> 14:15.040
You get a dog, ring bearer, and then you get a falcon security guard for the dog.

14:15.040 --> 14:15.520
Okay.

14:15.520 --> 14:18.800
And maybe the falcon can ride on the dog.

14:18.800 --> 14:23.360
Maybe you wanna be, oh, it's gonna be hard to get that ring over that falconer's glove.

14:23.360 --> 14:25.360
I guess if you use it in your offhand.

14:26.480 --> 14:27.920
The priest has to do the falcon.

14:27.920 --> 14:28.420
Okay.

14:29.280 --> 14:34.800
Well, but then again, you're trying to get people out of the ceremony to the party as

14:34.800 --> 14:35.520
quick as you can.

14:35.520 --> 14:38.320
Well, see, then the falcon sets in on crowd control.

14:38.880 --> 14:42.160
And you say, falcon, if anyone hesitates, go for the eyeballs.

14:42.160 --> 14:44.480
If anyone gets up to, this is taking too long.

14:44.480 --> 14:45.280
I'm saying, squee!

14:45.920 --> 14:46.640
Okay.

14:46.640 --> 14:48.000
Well, I guess I can-

14:48.000 --> 14:52.000
God, if you could get a falcon attack somewhere into your wedding.

14:52.800 --> 14:54.960
No, everyone would have to stop weddings.

14:54.960 --> 14:58.320
We'd have to be like, well, and that was how weddings ended.

14:58.320 --> 14:59.360
The end.

14:59.360 --> 15:04.080
Because it would be, no one would ever be able to top a falcon attack at your wedding.

15:04.080 --> 15:08.080
Plus, pay for the honeymoon with that America's Funniest Home Video dough.

15:08.080 --> 15:09.920
Thanks, Tom Bergeron.

15:09.920 --> 15:15.280
I don't think Tom Bergeron would endorse a video where a falcon attacked an old woman

15:15.280 --> 15:16.320
in the face.

15:16.320 --> 15:17.920
I don't think that's chuckle-worthy.

15:18.640 --> 15:21.360
And now America's Serious Home Videos.

15:21.360 --> 15:24.320
Everyone bow your head for a moment.

15:26.960 --> 15:28.480
Oh, I would watch that show.

15:28.480 --> 15:29.520
I would watch that too.

15:30.480 --> 15:35.440
I would have to say that Man Sits Quietly in the Corner was the most serious video tonight.

15:35.440 --> 15:36.480
$10,000.

15:36.480 --> 15:39.600
You guys have not watched much AFV lately.

15:39.600 --> 15:45.440
This show is so desperate for anyone, anyone to shoot video of anything.

15:45.440 --> 15:53.920
When this show debuted, everyone's dad had a video camera the size of like a stationary

15:53.920 --> 15:56.800
bicycle slung over their shoulder.

15:56.800 --> 15:58.640
Everyone was filming everything.

15:58.640 --> 16:05.200
Now, do you know how hard it is to do that show and just avoid thinking about YouTube

16:05.200 --> 16:06.400
for 30 minutes?

16:06.400 --> 16:08.960
Like to try to forget?

16:08.960 --> 16:13.280
Which leads to awkward situations and Tom's like, hey everybody, have you seen this Star

16:13.280 --> 16:14.000
Wars kid?

16:14.000 --> 16:17.920
You're going to love the cut of this little kid's gym.

16:17.920 --> 16:18.880
He's got a little pole.

16:18.880 --> 16:20.080
He's like, it's Jedi.

16:21.360 --> 16:23.360
There's $10,000 Star Wars kid.

16:23.360 --> 16:24.400
I'm 30.

16:24.400 --> 16:25.280
I am a lawyer.

16:25.840 --> 16:26.240
Thank you.

16:27.120 --> 16:28.880
I will use this for my startup.

16:30.560 --> 16:31.840
It's called YouTube 2.

16:33.440 --> 16:34.640
It's the next one.

16:34.640 --> 16:37.680
If you don't have a ring bear, how do you do the rings?

16:37.680 --> 16:40.240
I guess just the best man and the best woman?

16:41.040 --> 16:42.240
Like just have them?

16:42.240 --> 16:45.760
If I understand correctly, the ring bearers have not been actually carrying the rings

16:45.760 --> 16:46.960
for a long time.

16:46.960 --> 16:48.640
I think that they've got dummies.

16:48.640 --> 16:49.760
Yeah, they got a dummy pillow.

16:49.760 --> 16:52.960
Because it's usually like a little kid that you wouldn't trust with thousands of dollars.

16:54.960 --> 16:55.440
But why?

16:56.480 --> 16:58.480
This is a little kid that draws on the wall.

16:58.480 --> 17:02.080
You're going to give him the only thing that makes you married?

17:02.080 --> 17:04.880
Yeah, well, yeah, no, you're right.

17:04.880 --> 17:05.760
That is the only.

17:05.760 --> 17:06.560
Right?

17:06.560 --> 17:07.360
That's it.

17:07.360 --> 17:08.560
They're like power rings.

17:08.560 --> 17:10.880
It's like the ring, it is like the one ring.

17:10.880 --> 17:12.400
If it falls off, you're not married anymore.

17:12.400 --> 17:13.200
That's what I'm saying.

17:13.760 --> 17:14.000
Yeah.

17:15.040 --> 17:21.280
Although, to be fair, if a baby ring bearer did take my rings and throw them into Mordor,

17:23.600 --> 17:25.840
I think that I would have to honor that.

17:25.840 --> 17:26.240
Oh, yeah.

17:26.240 --> 17:27.200
I'd have to say, okay, baby.

17:27.200 --> 17:28.560
Well, that's, you got me there.

17:28.560 --> 17:28.960
That's a good one.

17:28.960 --> 17:32.000
If the baby puts the ring on, you're married to the baby.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.520
Yeah, it's a tricky situation.

17:33.520 --> 17:33.840
It is.

17:33.840 --> 17:35.440
Then the fuzz can get you.

17:35.440 --> 17:39.520
You can argue entrapment, but if that baby put that ring on of his own free will,

17:39.520 --> 17:40.560
you don't have a fucking leg.

17:40.560 --> 17:43.360
Listen, I mean, it's the same if the dog puts the ring on.

17:43.360 --> 17:45.760
I mean, you're dealing with a powder keg one way or the other.

17:45.760 --> 17:49.760
Well, unless you're in, there are several states where that would be fine.

17:49.760 --> 17:53.680
If a baby puts the one ring on, you're not finding that bastard ever again.

17:53.680 --> 17:54.640
He's gone.

17:54.640 --> 18:00.240
If you see a baby put the one ring on, you better open every bag of flour you can find

18:00.240 --> 18:01.760
and just start throwing it in the air.

18:01.760 --> 18:08.320
In the off chance that some of the flakes will land on his curls, so you can maybe see some

18:08.320 --> 18:09.360
sort of silhouette.

18:09.360 --> 18:11.360
Because if not, you will never find that baby again.

18:11.360 --> 18:12.800
Babies don't want to be caught.

18:12.800 --> 18:13.920
Baby's invisible now.

18:13.920 --> 18:14.720
He's happy.

18:14.720 --> 18:15.360
He's out there.

18:15.360 --> 18:16.080
He's living life.

18:16.640 --> 18:17.120
Precious.

18:17.120 --> 18:20.560
So right now, I'm writing the script to Hollow Man 3.

18:20.560 --> 18:23.840
It's sort of like Hollow Man, you know, Hollow Man with Kevin Bacon.

18:24.400 --> 18:28.240
But what if instead of Kevin Bacon, we put some Baby's Day Out heat in there?

18:28.240 --> 18:28.740
Okay.

18:28.740 --> 18:32.180
So that's all I've got so far.

18:32.180 --> 18:34.580
That's the start of the goof.

18:34.580 --> 18:35.620
I've only got the one paragraph.

18:35.620 --> 18:37.300
You've got a great elevator pitch.

18:37.300 --> 18:38.820
Now you just need to flush it out.

18:38.820 --> 18:43.540
Yeah, I've seen more scripts picked up on spec for less than that.

18:43.540 --> 18:44.500
The good news is-

18:45.620 --> 18:47.300
Son of the Mask was just like four words.

18:47.300 --> 18:48.980
It was just like, mask, but with kids.

18:50.180 --> 18:56.420
Following the adventures of an invisible baby would be a cost-effective movie, I think.

18:56.420 --> 18:59.780
Well, you guys can't see this, but boy howdy.

18:59.780 --> 19:01.540
It is hilarious.

19:01.540 --> 19:02.820
This is a precarious situation.

19:02.820 --> 19:04.900
All you see is the cookie jar just fell over.

19:04.900 --> 19:09.780
But what you didn't see was the hour of antics leading up to it.

19:09.780 --> 19:14.340
If you can get a baby to wrap itself in bandages and put on sunglasses,

19:14.340 --> 19:18.100
like in memoirs of an invisible man, you might have a box office smash.

19:18.100 --> 19:21.460
Or if you have an invisible baby walk into a lady's bathroom,

19:21.460 --> 19:26.820
watch her take a shower like in Hollow Man, then you're an evil person.

19:28.020 --> 19:31.940
In this movie that I'm also acting as cast director,

19:31.940 --> 19:34.260
I gotta get Daniel Day-Lewis as the invisible bandit.

19:35.620 --> 19:37.620
I think that you guys are trying to write a comedy,

19:37.620 --> 19:40.500
and I'm writing the worst horror movie ever.

19:40.500 --> 19:43.620
Yeah, because all my favorite comedies star Daniel Day-Lewis.

19:45.140 --> 19:47.300
My left foot, my left-

19:47.300 --> 19:48.900
My left giant foot.

19:48.900 --> 19:52.180
My left can't stop laughing, too.

19:52.180 --> 19:57.380
I didn't know how he would do playing Mo, Larry, and Curly,

19:57.380 --> 19:59.540
but once they got all the computer effects in there,

20:00.260 --> 20:03.220
you really could not tell that it was just him.

20:03.220 --> 20:05.460
And I loved him in There Will Be Blood in Feces.

20:06.260 --> 20:09.700
Yeah, because that is more serious.

20:10.980 --> 20:12.420
You moved away from comedy.

20:12.420 --> 20:13.300
You moved-

20:13.300 --> 20:14.100
I'm laughing.

20:14.100 --> 20:16.340
He was in Last of the Lolhekens.

20:16.340 --> 20:19.220
Is that appropriate?

20:19.220 --> 20:20.740
Is that a thing we can do?

20:20.740 --> 20:24.740
I think that the sequel to There Will Be Blood

20:24.740 --> 20:26.020
would just be called Milkshakes.

20:29.540 --> 20:33.060
It's just him, and he's been acquitted for the murder

20:33.060 --> 20:35.140
that takes place at the end of There Will Be Blood.

20:35.140 --> 20:38.100
He's been acquitted, and he opens up his own milkshake stand

20:38.100 --> 20:38.980
and gets in all kinds of milkshakes.

20:38.980 --> 20:41.700
But then a rival milkshake stand opens across the street,

20:41.700 --> 20:43.140
and they have to have a dance-off.

20:43.140 --> 20:48.260
And then he burns it the fuck down and kills the guy's kid.

20:48.260 --> 20:49.380
Two stars.

20:49.380 --> 20:49.940
Two stars.

20:49.940 --> 20:51.060
Would not watch again.

20:54.100 --> 20:55.460
Let's do another question here.

20:55.460 --> 20:57.540
When I met my girlfriend a few years back,

20:57.540 --> 21:00.420
I inherited a load of her friends, most of whom are cool.

21:01.060 --> 21:04.500
There are two in particular who we've especially-

21:05.700 --> 21:07.700
sorry, who we're especially close to.

21:07.700 --> 21:08.820
We see them regularly,

21:08.820 --> 21:11.460
and they are awesome people to hang out with.

21:11.460 --> 21:14.180
The trouble is that they both insist on calling me

21:14.180 --> 21:18.180
by my surname all the time, which really pisses me off.

21:18.180 --> 21:20.180
I don't think my surname is particularly odd,

21:20.180 --> 21:23.460
so it's not like it's embarrassing to be called in public,

21:23.460 --> 21:25.540
but it's still not how I like to be addressed.

21:26.500 --> 21:29.220
They even write it on birthday cards, which is really bizarre.

21:29.220 --> 21:31.780
And I've never introduced myself by just my surname,

21:31.780 --> 21:34.020
and no one else insists on calling me by it,

21:34.020 --> 21:36.260
so I don't know where this comes from.

21:37.220 --> 21:39.460
Am I wrong for getting so annoyed at this?

21:39.460 --> 21:42.100
How do I tell them to stop it without coming across

21:42.100 --> 21:44.660
like a massive dick and upsetting two of my best friends?

21:44.660 --> 21:47.460
And that's from Miss Nomar in Manchester.

21:49.380 --> 21:49.940
I don't get it.

21:50.500 --> 21:53.060
To me, I think calling somebody by their surname

21:53.060 --> 21:55.540
is like the ultimate endearment ever.

21:57.380 --> 22:02.820
You know, in college, I would say like half of our friends

22:02.820 --> 22:04.740
were just called by their surnames.

22:04.740 --> 22:05.060
Yeah.

22:05.060 --> 22:07.060
Like I had so many friends that were just-

22:07.060 --> 22:09.540
I knew them as that, like I was known as McElroy.

22:09.540 --> 22:11.460
It was really weird when I'd come home from school

22:11.460 --> 22:12.580
and people would call me Travis.

22:12.580 --> 22:14.820
It really kind of threw me off for four years.

22:14.820 --> 22:16.420
I don't see anything wrong with it.

22:16.420 --> 22:17.940
Well, but he doesn't like it.

22:18.980 --> 22:20.100
I mean, it's irrelevant.

22:20.100 --> 22:21.460
He doesn't dig on it.

22:21.460 --> 22:22.900
But it sounds like a personal problem,

22:22.900 --> 22:25.220
because once you have a name, you know,

22:25.780 --> 22:27.700
once you become like,

22:28.580 --> 22:31.060
ah, it's Nut Chuckles, then like you're Nut Chuckles,

22:31.060 --> 22:33.140
and there's nothing you can do to reverse that.

22:34.340 --> 22:35.780
I don't know why you'd be called Nut Chuckles.

22:35.780 --> 22:38.980
Pardon, are you saying his last name is Nut Chuckles?

22:38.980 --> 22:40.660
No, I'm saying like, that's a nickname.

22:40.660 --> 22:45.140
But like, regardless, if your name is Carl,

22:45.140 --> 22:47.220
and people call you Carl, you can't be like,

22:47.220 --> 22:49.860
guys, I'd actually prefer to be called by my surname,

22:49.860 --> 22:51.140
which is Nut Chuckles.

22:51.140 --> 22:53.380
Well, I'm fucking confusing the whole thing.

22:54.180 --> 22:57.460
Once you introduce the idea, I think that once you say,

22:57.460 --> 23:00.020
like, I don't like that name, I like this other name,

23:00.580 --> 23:04.340
you've either A, like absolutely,

23:04.340 --> 23:08.180
if it was me, you would have absolutely submitted that

23:08.180 --> 23:09.860
from now until the end of time,

23:09.860 --> 23:11.380
that is what you will be referred to.

23:11.940 --> 23:14.020
Or two, it's gonna be this weird thing,

23:14.020 --> 23:17.220
where they'll call you Nut Chuckles,

23:17.220 --> 23:20.260
and then, oh, I'm sorry, Daniel.

23:21.060 --> 23:21.540
Right.

23:21.540 --> 23:22.020
It's gonna be awkward.

23:22.020 --> 23:22.900
Daniel Day-Lewis.

23:22.900 --> 23:26.500
Daniel Day-Lewis Nut Chuckles is the thing.

23:26.500 --> 23:29.940
The time to bring this up was a million times ago

23:29.940 --> 23:31.380
when they first said it.

23:31.380 --> 23:31.880
Yeah.

23:31.880 --> 23:34.520
Yeah, because now it's like,

23:35.160 --> 23:37.720
why, I've been doing this for years.

23:37.720 --> 23:38.200
Right?

23:38.200 --> 23:40.360
I've been calling you Nut Chuckles for years,

23:40.360 --> 23:41.800
and now I'm just a dick.

23:43.560 --> 23:46.760
You've gotta just one day, out of nowhere, just snap.

23:47.640 --> 23:48.680
Stop it!

23:48.680 --> 23:49.560
Stop it, no!

23:51.160 --> 23:51.720
Just stop!

23:53.160 --> 23:55.560
Start the sentence with, for the last time.

23:56.840 --> 23:58.280
And they're like, whoa, whoa, whoa.

23:58.280 --> 24:00.760
And you're like, I have told you guys a million times.

24:00.760 --> 24:03.240
You haven't told us any, any times!

24:03.240 --> 24:05.160
It is David, it has always been David,

24:05.160 --> 24:06.440
it will always be David.

24:08.040 --> 24:10.840
I would say that if they're not doing it maliciously,

24:10.840 --> 24:13.400
if there's nothing, like if you didn't ask them not to,

24:13.400 --> 24:14.360
and they keep doing it,

24:15.800 --> 24:19.480
in any way getting upset about it or saying something,

24:19.480 --> 24:22.280
it's just gonna make them feel awful.

24:22.280 --> 24:23.320
It's gonna make them feel bad.

24:23.320 --> 24:24.120
It's not gonna be worth it.

24:24.120 --> 24:25.320
Just suck it up.

24:25.320 --> 24:27.240
You can get used to anything, trust me.

24:27.240 --> 24:30.280
Whether it's being called, not chuckles,

24:30.280 --> 24:31.880
or the butt, or anything.

24:31.880 --> 24:33.480
You can get used to anything.

24:33.480 --> 24:35.240
Those are your two examples?

24:35.240 --> 24:37.240
Not chuckles or the butt?

24:37.240 --> 24:41.480
I don't think, are you saying you can get used

24:41.480 --> 24:42.920
to being called the butt,

24:42.920 --> 24:44.920
or were you saying something far more?

24:44.920 --> 24:46.760
No, you can just get used to the butt.

24:46.760 --> 24:47.720
You get used to that stuff.

24:47.720 --> 24:48.200
Oh, okay.

24:48.200 --> 24:48.920
You get used to the butt.

24:48.920 --> 24:49.640
You get used to the butt.

24:50.840 --> 24:53.720
Take it from me, ladies, and so inclined gentlemen,

24:53.720 --> 24:54.520
you get used to the butt.

24:54.520 --> 24:56.360
You get used to the butt.

24:56.360 --> 24:57.880
And some dogs.

24:58.920 --> 24:59.800
And some dogs.

25:01.080 --> 25:02.920
And some dogs.

25:03.480 --> 25:04.600
And chairs.

25:04.600 --> 25:07.480
Do you guys want to go to the Money Zone?

25:07.480 --> 25:07.960
Yeah.

25:18.120 --> 25:21.080
Trav, you got this message here.

25:21.080 --> 25:22.360
Who's it for?

25:22.360 --> 25:24.280
It's from my dear friend, Andrew Mead.

25:24.280 --> 25:26.120
I didn't know you two were so close.

25:26.120 --> 25:27.560
Oh, super tight.

25:27.560 --> 25:29.000
Who's the message from, though?

25:29.000 --> 25:30.440
That's the real question.

25:30.440 --> 25:35.080
Oh, it's from some jokers, Michael Pertil and Tyron Bicknell.

25:35.080 --> 25:36.280
I don't know who they are,

25:36.280 --> 25:38.920
but they claim to know my dear friend, Andrew Mead.

25:38.920 --> 25:42.040
Sound like they on some Game of Thrones shit with those names.

25:42.040 --> 25:42.600
I like that.

25:43.160 --> 25:45.560
Yeah, which, are you House Bicknell or House Pertil?

25:46.600 --> 25:50.520
Dear Endazzle, I'm assuming that's their nickname for Andrew.

25:50.520 --> 25:51.720
I don't call him that.

25:51.720 --> 25:52.760
Happy birthday.

25:52.760 --> 25:54.200
Good luck in the new year.

25:54.200 --> 25:56.520
May your lightsaber always ignite to full strength

25:56.520 --> 25:58.120
so you can open her blast doors.

25:59.240 --> 26:03.320
You're a true match tonight, Ty and Mike.

26:03.320 --> 26:04.520
Is the lightsaber his dick?

26:05.560 --> 26:06.200
Good one, Trav.

26:06.200 --> 26:07.560
I think you really pieced that one together.

26:07.560 --> 26:08.920
Good job, Columbo.

26:08.920 --> 26:09.720
Thank you.

26:09.720 --> 26:10.680
One more thing.

26:10.680 --> 26:12.760
Is the lightsaber your dick?

26:12.760 --> 26:13.240
Yeah.

26:13.240 --> 26:14.200
Ma'am, if I may.

26:14.200 --> 26:15.000
If I may.

26:15.000 --> 26:16.040
One more thing, ma'am.

26:16.040 --> 26:16.680
One more thing.

26:17.480 --> 26:19.000
Well, the blaster was her vagina.

26:19.000 --> 26:21.720
End of episode.

26:24.040 --> 26:25.400
Get that man out of here.

26:25.400 --> 26:27.160
That's the shortest best friend I'm sorry.

26:27.160 --> 26:30.040
I just wanna, let's talk more about her vagina.

26:30.040 --> 26:32.280
Get out of here, Columbo.

26:32.280 --> 26:35.080
Jesus, my mother is dying over it.

26:35.080 --> 26:38.200
No, I just wanna, what was it about the lightsaber dick again?

26:38.200 --> 26:39.480
I wear a trenchcoat.

26:39.480 --> 26:40.520
What did you expect?

26:41.080 --> 26:42.200
I'm so close.

26:42.200 --> 26:43.000
Look at this eye.

26:43.000 --> 26:48.760
I have both moral and physiological reservations about this happy birthday message.

26:49.400 --> 27:01.080
Because it's never been my experience, I don't wanna get too blue, but he's saying that you're boner.

27:01.080 --> 27:05.800
I hope that, first of all, this is a public radio kind of thing.

27:05.800 --> 27:07.640
So like there's a lot of people listening.

27:07.640 --> 27:12.200
You just hope that your friend can get his dick hard enough to give you a boner.

27:12.200 --> 27:15.400
Hard enough to get inside of a vagina.

27:16.440 --> 27:18.040
And you made it worse.

27:18.040 --> 27:21.480
I think the greatest sin is you made us complicit in that.

27:22.920 --> 27:25.560
That's what I think really stings here.

27:25.560 --> 27:28.920
You made us complicit in wishing your friend's dick hard.

27:28.920 --> 27:31.160
It is a breach of trust.

27:31.160 --> 27:32.600
Yes, Travis, that's correct.

27:33.400 --> 27:36.040
Speaking of getting your dick hard to get inside of a vagina.

27:36.600 --> 27:40.520
That was, by the way, possibly the most fluid transition.

27:40.520 --> 27:42.600
Except for this thing that I'm saying right now.

27:42.600 --> 27:43.800
That was the most fluid transition.

27:43.800 --> 27:45.000
Until we acknowledged it.

27:45.000 --> 27:45.960
It was pretty sweet.

27:45.960 --> 27:51.080
You can head over to ExtremeStrengths.com and get yourself a penis pump kit.

27:52.360 --> 27:57.080
You can put it on your wiener and then it goes suck, suck, suck, suck, suck.

27:57.080 --> 27:59.080
And it gets you some penis gains.

28:00.680 --> 28:02.120
And some Chris gains.

28:02.120 --> 28:03.320
And some performance.

28:06.520 --> 28:09.640
The penis pump, you can program it to play Chris gains.

28:09.640 --> 28:11.960
To scare your boner away forever.

28:13.800 --> 28:15.800
You'll sit there so confused.

28:15.800 --> 28:17.400
Why does he have a soul patch?

28:17.400 --> 28:18.920
Why does he have a soul patch?

28:18.920 --> 28:21.080
This motherfucker looks exactly like Garth Brooks.

28:21.080 --> 28:22.360
Ah, my dick's gone.

28:23.960 --> 28:25.080
My dick ran away.

28:25.640 --> 28:26.280
Bye, dick.

28:27.400 --> 28:28.120
See ya, dick.

28:29.160 --> 28:32.520
They have so many pleasure tools for you.

28:34.840 --> 28:36.600
We need to decide on a new coupon code.

28:36.600 --> 28:38.280
I know, what's the new coupon code?

28:38.280 --> 28:40.360
Our last coupon code.

28:40.360 --> 28:42.120
By the way, guys, we love you.

28:42.680 --> 28:44.280
Don't fucking leak this shit.

28:44.280 --> 28:47.880
Because we leaked, somebody leaked midlist to coupon sites.

28:47.880 --> 28:50.360
And now we gotta start over with a new coupon code.

28:50.360 --> 28:53.080
And we're gonna forget and keep saying midlist.

28:53.080 --> 28:53.880
And everyone's gonna be sad.

28:53.880 --> 28:56.600
And listen, leaking is a serious issue.

28:56.600 --> 28:56.840
Yeah.

28:56.840 --> 28:58.440
So let me recommend a butt plug.

28:59.880 --> 29:00.200
Available.

29:00.200 --> 29:03.080
Sydney said that I couldn't use Pontifex.

29:03.960 --> 29:04.200
Yeah.

29:05.240 --> 29:07.240
Well, she's a good Catholic.

29:07.240 --> 29:07.560
How?

29:07.560 --> 29:09.000
So it doesn't make any sense.

29:09.000 --> 29:10.200
Just pick a word now, Justin.

29:10.200 --> 29:10.920
Look around the room.

29:10.920 --> 29:12.760
Pick a word that has nothing to do with the show.

29:12.760 --> 29:13.720
Jumbo condoms.

29:13.720 --> 29:14.840
I'm just looking around the room.

29:20.840 --> 29:22.040
Man in the corner.

29:22.040 --> 29:23.320
My good friend Dana Carvey.

29:23.320 --> 29:25.240
Did you guys know I'm good friends with Dana Carvey?

29:25.240 --> 29:25.880
It's not a big deal.

29:25.880 --> 29:26.760
I don't like talking about it.

29:26.760 --> 29:28.840
But I am really good friends with Dana Carvey.

29:28.840 --> 29:30.040
Sports car keys.

29:30.040 --> 29:30.920
Peebo Bryson.

29:32.760 --> 29:33.320
He's here.

29:33.320 --> 29:34.200
Sex trophies.

29:34.200 --> 29:37.320
Mel Brooks.

29:37.320 --> 29:38.600
Melva toast.

29:39.240 --> 29:40.120
Melva toast.

29:40.120 --> 29:42.280
So just type in the coupon code Melva toast.

29:43.960 --> 29:47.000
You get 20% off all of your bread goods.

29:47.000 --> 29:47.320

29:48.040 --> 29:49.080

Hey, everybody.

30:30.280 --> 30:31.480
My name is Dave Shamka.

30:31.480 --> 30:32.520
And I'm Graham Clark.

30:32.520 --> 30:35.800
And we are the hosts of a show called Stop Podcasting Yourself,

30:35.800 --> 30:38.520
right here on the Maximumfun.org network.

30:38.520 --> 30:44.680
We're the first ever Canadian podcast to win a Canadian comedy award for best podcast.

30:44.680 --> 30:46.360
I think we went with that too early.

30:46.360 --> 30:47.720
I think we seem braggy.

30:47.720 --> 30:54.040
It's a weekly comedy show, a very easygoing chat between Dave, myself, guests.

30:54.040 --> 30:58.920
We'll talk about things that we've overheard during the week and also Hulk Hogan.

30:58.920 --> 31:00.280
Stop Podcasting Yourself.

31:00.280 --> 31:03.640
Head over to Maximumfun.org to download an episode today.

31:07.000 --> 31:07.960
You guys want a Yahoo?

31:07.960 --> 31:08.440
Yeah, I do.

31:10.040 --> 31:11.560
This Yahoo was sent in by John Davis.

31:13.320 --> 31:14.200
No, it wasn't.

31:15.080 --> 31:15.960
It was.

31:15.960 --> 31:16.840
Big fan of the show.

31:16.840 --> 31:17.640
Big fan of the show.

31:17.640 --> 31:19.320
Please don't use sexy Garfields.

31:23.320 --> 31:25.000
I can't believe that just happened.

31:28.360 --> 31:30.040
Is John Davis the Garfield guy?

31:30.040 --> 31:30.540
Yeah.

31:33.400 --> 31:34.120
Of course he is.

31:35.560 --> 31:36.680
Jim Davis.

31:36.680 --> 31:37.320
Jim Davis.

31:37.320 --> 31:37.720
Yeah, that's right.

31:37.720 --> 31:38.920
Jim Davis is the Garfield.

31:38.920 --> 31:40.440
His friends call him John.

31:40.440 --> 31:40.940
Okay.

31:43.080 --> 31:46.520
It's by Yahoo Answers user Lord Donald Farnsworth who asks,

31:47.480 --> 31:51.080
what do you dislike most about people who don't own horses?

31:52.360 --> 31:55.000
I am also including people who lease horses.

31:55.000 --> 32:01.080
For me, it is that they are always trying to get into the horse scene

32:01.080 --> 32:02.760
when they clearly don't belong there.

32:04.360 --> 32:06.040
These horse poseurs.

32:06.760 --> 32:10.440
I think what I really love about this question is the pretension.

32:11.240 --> 32:11.740
Yeah.

32:12.680 --> 32:19.800
Yeah, to say if you lease a horse, your bond with that particular equestrian

32:19.800 --> 32:27.080
is not as strong as somebody who wholesale owns that motherfucker.

32:27.080 --> 32:30.600
And that's my biggest problem is you don't understand horse love.

32:31.240 --> 32:34.360
I also didn't know you could lease living beings.

32:34.360 --> 32:35.080
Yeah, sure.

32:35.080 --> 32:35.880
Yeah, of course.

32:35.880 --> 32:38.200
Man, I got a sweet down payment on a cat.

32:39.960 --> 32:41.960
Couple more months, I'm gonna own that baby.

32:41.960 --> 32:43.320
Few more payments.

32:43.320 --> 32:45.640
Yeah, I just hope the repo man doesn't come to-

32:45.640 --> 32:46.360
You know what I'm saying?

32:46.360 --> 32:50.440
Man, you don't make the payments on your cat, I gotta take your cat.

32:50.440 --> 32:53.160
No, but I was gonna make it, I was so glad.

32:53.160 --> 32:55.960
I'm sorry, Mr. Whiskers is coming with us.

32:55.960 --> 32:58.600
Unless you can answer these three trivia questions.

33:01.400 --> 33:04.440
I'm sorry, what repo reality shows are you watching?

33:04.440 --> 33:07.800
Have you not seen repo quiz?

33:07.800 --> 33:09.080
What's that fucking show called?

33:09.080 --> 33:10.680
It's an actual show where they're like,

33:10.680 --> 33:13.400
we're gonna take your car unless you can answer these three questions.

33:13.400 --> 33:14.760
Is it repo games?

33:14.760 --> 33:16.840
Is it repo games? Is that right?

33:17.640 --> 33:19.320
No, that's the slice of the lemon movie.

33:19.320 --> 33:24.120
Guys, what do you dislike most about people who don't own horses?

33:24.840 --> 33:25.400
The smell.

33:26.200 --> 33:26.680
Of them?

33:27.400 --> 33:27.880
I guess.

33:28.600 --> 33:33.240
They don't smell like the leathery oil of a horse's back?

33:33.240 --> 33:36.840
I'm just saying that they don't look like they've been riding a horse all day.

33:37.560 --> 33:38.440
I hate that.

33:38.440 --> 33:40.280
If you're gonna buy a horse, you need to-

33:40.280 --> 33:41.000
You know what I hate?

33:41.000 --> 33:44.680
I hate those short boots that people who don't own horses wear.

33:45.240 --> 33:47.720
Get some long boots, you know, with spurs.

33:48.360 --> 33:48.920
Yeah.

33:48.920 --> 33:51.160
I hate how they never yell like, yeah!

33:51.800 --> 33:53.320
Or kachoms.

33:54.440 --> 33:56.520
Or a sippy-ed up.

33:57.320 --> 33:58.840
Zip it up, horsey.

34:00.200 --> 34:02.120
Let's do this horse friend.

34:02.120 --> 34:04.520
Can we not kickstart a horse?

34:05.720 --> 34:06.440
Guys.

34:06.440 --> 34:07.320
Are you saying that-

34:07.320 --> 34:08.280
Guys, hold on.

34:08.280 --> 34:12.280
Are you talking about revving up the engine?

34:14.440 --> 34:15.400
We gotta get out of here.

34:18.120 --> 34:19.480
And that's the sound of it idling.

34:19.480 --> 34:24.520
Jon Bon Jovi, I'm not making a shitty metaphor between a horse and a motorcycle.

34:24.520 --> 34:25.960
What I'm saying to you is-

34:25.960 --> 34:27.800
Wait, he wasn't riding an actual steel horse?

34:27.800 --> 34:28.360
Oh my god.

34:29.080 --> 34:31.240
That would make it the fucking best song.

34:32.440 --> 34:34.200
On my cybernetic horse!

34:34.200 --> 34:38.600
I ride the wastelands with my katana.

34:40.040 --> 34:41.960
With my vibra sword.

34:41.960 --> 34:43.800
And my emerald visor.

34:50.280 --> 34:52.680
I smoke a pack of nano stems.

34:55.720 --> 34:56.920
Oh my god.

34:56.920 --> 34:57.720
Oh, Jon.

34:58.520 --> 35:00.040
Somebody write that, baby.

35:00.040 --> 35:05.880
I've seen a million faces and I process them for fuel for my metal horse.

35:08.120 --> 35:09.720
I'm a cowboy.

35:09.720 --> 35:12.040
I sell water at a great profit.

35:14.680 --> 35:16.360
The land is not a myth.

35:20.920 --> 35:21.960
So, no.

35:21.960 --> 35:25.960
We've talked about kickstarting a European tour before.

35:25.960 --> 35:31.160
We've talked about kickstarting a trip to London and Scotland and all that stuff.

35:31.160 --> 35:37.160
And I don't know if enough people would want to kickstart for that to happen.

35:37.160 --> 35:43.880
But I do know that if we made a kickstarter to buy a horse that would be owned by us,

35:43.880 --> 35:47.800
the MBM nation, I think people would really get on board with this.

35:47.800 --> 35:48.840
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

35:48.840 --> 35:53.960
So you're not just talking about a horse that you and Travis and I would share.

35:53.960 --> 35:58.760
You were talking about everybody throw down a fiver on this horse.

35:58.760 --> 36:01.400
And then based on the different reward tiers,

36:01.400 --> 36:04.840
you would get a minute or two on our collective horse.

36:04.840 --> 36:05.960
Well, no, no, no, no.

36:05.960 --> 36:09.240
So like the world would own this horse.

36:09.240 --> 36:12.280
It would belong to all of us.

36:12.280 --> 36:14.840
But really, us.

36:15.480 --> 36:17.960
So like specifically, us.

36:17.960 --> 36:22.920
Like any good kickstarter, it would give people the feeling of being invested

36:22.920 --> 36:27.960
without actually the chance of any sort of return on that investment.

36:27.960 --> 36:32.440
But if you pay in at the highest level, you get the choicest cuts of meat.

36:32.440 --> 36:36.760
Once the horse is dead, you will, of course, get like a $20 donation.

36:36.760 --> 36:38.120
Or maybe you could get a hooves.

36:38.840 --> 36:42.840
And there is no sweeter meat than the meat of a horse

36:42.840 --> 36:46.520
that we have been aging beneath us for decades.

36:46.520 --> 36:49.400
I just think that I would really love it if we owned a horse

36:49.400 --> 36:54.040
and then just had like a series of photos of like the horse listening to our podcast.

36:54.040 --> 36:55.960
The horse chilling out on a beanbag chair.

36:57.000 --> 36:58.280
But never like ridden.

36:58.280 --> 37:01.000
The horse inevitably and quickly dying.

37:01.000 --> 37:02.520
Because what the fuck do we know?

37:02.520 --> 37:04.680
Because we fed it like, you know, red stripe.

37:06.360 --> 37:07.480
You like greasy cups?

37:07.480 --> 37:08.440
Ah, fuck.

37:08.440 --> 37:10.040
We need a second kickstarter.

37:10.040 --> 37:12.520
I gave him a bunch of red vines and now he's dead.

37:12.520 --> 37:14.840
Launch the sequel to our first kickstarter.

37:14.840 --> 37:16.760
And it's called Oops, We Did It Again.

37:16.760 --> 37:19.560
Oops, We Gave Our Horse Diabetes.

37:19.560 --> 37:20.120
And Diarrhea.

37:20.120 --> 37:22.120
Diabetes Horse 2013.

37:23.880 --> 37:24.360
I want to give him-

37:24.360 --> 37:25.160
That was his name.

37:25.800 --> 37:27.400
I want to give a horse red vines.

37:28.760 --> 37:29.720
I bet he'd love them.

37:29.720 --> 37:30.840
I bet he would like them.

37:30.840 --> 37:32.280
And then I bet he would diarrhea.

37:34.440 --> 37:35.000
Diarrhea is hard.

37:35.000 --> 37:37.560
The horse might wrap this carrot in red vines and bacon.

37:37.560 --> 37:38.360
You are welcome.

37:39.080 --> 37:40.920
Enjoy this culinary treat.

37:40.920 --> 37:44.600
Justin, you were saying how hard, how hard with this horse diarrhea?

37:44.600 --> 37:47.640
I feel like you were, you know, there was more to that thought.

37:47.640 --> 37:48.120
I'm sorry.

37:48.120 --> 37:52.200
I didn't mean to interrupt the quantification of how hard the horse with diarrhea.

37:52.760 --> 37:56.760
I think we would not be popular amongst other horse owners.

37:56.760 --> 38:01.080
I feel like we would not fit into whatever sort of socioeconomic circle that is.

38:01.080 --> 38:04.040
We would be like Rodney Dangerfield in Caddyshack.

38:04.040 --> 38:05.000
Yes, exactly.

38:05.000 --> 38:06.600
Or Rodney Dangerfield in anything.

38:07.160 --> 38:12.440
We would be the animal house in like the yacht race of the boat that we built ourselves.

38:12.440 --> 38:14.600
Diabetes horse?

38:18.600 --> 38:22.840
Your horse diarrhea-ed on my horse and now I lost all the contests ever.

38:22.840 --> 38:26.440
We would get in there first and, guys, clear something up for us.

38:26.440 --> 38:32.280
We know none of you are the actual dean, but we do have to thwart someone.

38:32.280 --> 38:37.080
So whichever one of you is closest to the dean, just let us know so we can thwart them, please.

38:37.640 --> 38:42.280
I just assume everybody who owns a horse has been the dean of some institution in their lives.

38:42.280 --> 38:46.600
And we roll up in our big sunglasses and sweatshirts and red vines.

38:46.600 --> 38:51.320
The twist of the story is that rather than having a scrappy horse that ends up

38:51.320 --> 38:55.320
showing up all the rich guy horses, ours will actually die.

38:59.160 --> 39:03.320
Listen, man, maybe we know just a little bit more than you about horses.

39:03.320 --> 39:06.840
Also, we're going to have to back out of the big race because our horse is dead.

39:06.840 --> 39:12.920
Uh-oh, that can only mean one thing, us in a horse costume winning the race at the end.

39:12.920 --> 39:13.480
Oh!

39:13.480 --> 39:14.680
Who saw this coming?

39:14.680 --> 39:15.640
Wait for it.

39:15.640 --> 39:19.000
And then we have to build a cybernetic horse to win the race.

39:20.360 --> 39:22.280
On a horse made of brothers I ride!

39:23.880 --> 39:29.400
Guys, I don't want to, you know, I don't want to break your spirit, but horses are very fast.

39:30.040 --> 39:33.720
Then the odds of you running faster than a horse in a horse costume are...

39:33.720 --> 39:35.320
Low.

39:35.320 --> 39:38.040
Given what you're forgetting, is we want it the most.

39:38.040 --> 39:40.600
Haven't you seen the end of Cool Runnings?

39:40.600 --> 39:41.160
It'll dis-

39:41.160 --> 39:41.720
Right?

39:41.720 --> 39:46.120
Oh, the movie ends with us carrying the horse on our shoulders over the finish line.

39:48.840 --> 39:50.680
You can finish diabetes, Doug!

39:50.680 --> 39:51.640
I believe in you!

39:52.680 --> 39:53.800
That horse is dead.

39:53.800 --> 39:55.800
That horse has been dead for 30 minutes.

39:56.440 --> 39:56.940
Get up!

39:58.360 --> 40:01.160
Get off Diabetes Horse 2013!

40:01.160 --> 40:03.080
I got red vines waiting for you!

40:03.080 --> 40:06.680
The revenge of the nerds guys who run in and start plugging electrodes into him like,

40:06.680 --> 40:09.080
don't worry, we'll fix him with science!

40:09.080 --> 40:09.880
You won't.

40:09.880 --> 40:10.280
You won't.

40:10.280 --> 40:10.840
You can't.

40:12.440 --> 40:13.400
How about another question?

40:13.400 --> 40:14.280
How that guy be, guys?

40:15.080 --> 40:15.580
Good.

40:16.520 --> 40:18.680
I'm in my first year of teaching high school.

40:18.680 --> 40:21.800
I told my girlfriend that I looked up some of my students on Facebook.

40:21.800 --> 40:23.480
She thought this was really creepy.

40:23.480 --> 40:26.120
It's not like I read all their wall posts or look through their pictures.

40:26.120 --> 40:28.920
I basically just looked at their profile picture and moved on to the next student.

40:28.920 --> 40:33.160
And she agreed that it wouldn't be weird to do this if I had started a new job and looked

40:33.160 --> 40:37.080
at the profiles of my co-workers, but still thought it was creepy to do to students.

40:37.080 --> 40:38.040
Is she right?

40:38.040 --> 40:39.960
That's from creeping in Cali?

40:39.960 --> 40:43.560
There's a question mark there to leave it open to interpretation whether or not the

40:43.560 --> 40:44.680
person is actually creepy.

40:47.080 --> 40:48.440
Is it open to interpretation?

40:48.440 --> 40:51.400
Because it seems like the answers are pretty cut and dry, yeah.

40:51.400 --> 40:51.880
Yeah.

40:51.880 --> 40:53.000
It's pretty creepy.

40:53.880 --> 40:55.160
Imagine it this way.

40:55.160 --> 41:00.040
If one of your students was in the room with you, or Jesus was in the room, or a co-worker

41:00.040 --> 41:04.200
was in the room, would you squeeze on the Facebook profiles of your students?

41:04.200 --> 41:06.120
I imagine you would not.

41:07.320 --> 41:07.880
Yeah.

41:07.880 --> 41:12.280
I have a hard enough time looking at Facebook profiles of people I know and not feeling

41:12.280 --> 41:12.840
weird.

41:12.840 --> 41:13.160
Yeah.

41:14.360 --> 41:17.080
I also imagine that when I was...

41:18.440 --> 41:22.200
I guess I was in high school right before Facebook.

41:22.200 --> 41:27.560
Facebook sort of came up while I was in high school, but it didn't really permeate my school.

41:28.360 --> 41:32.440
My teachers had been like, hey, Griffin, it seems like you had a really great time at

41:32.440 --> 41:33.240
that party.

41:33.240 --> 41:35.560
And by party, I mean youth group, probably.

41:37.960 --> 41:39.560
That would weird me the fuck out.

41:39.560 --> 41:40.840
I would not dig on that.

41:41.480 --> 41:44.200
Hey, Griffin, I also really like fallout boy.

41:44.200 --> 41:45.000
High five.

41:45.000 --> 41:45.640
All right.

41:45.640 --> 41:46.920
All right, teach.

41:46.920 --> 41:49.000
Would have been reliant K at that point.

41:49.000 --> 41:51.640
Griffin, I also think Jesus rocks.

41:51.640 --> 41:52.360
High five.

41:52.360 --> 41:53.880
Griffin, I too am lino.

41:53.880 --> 41:54.440
Let's...

41:54.440 --> 42:00.600
Reliant K deep cut for a reliant K joke everybody can enjoy.

42:03.640 --> 42:05.960
Man, don't do this thing.

42:05.960 --> 42:07.400
Don't do this thing.

42:07.400 --> 42:08.520
This just stinks.

42:08.520 --> 42:11.560
I feel like you're throwing off the balance.

42:11.560 --> 42:12.840
But then again, maybe not.

42:14.520 --> 42:17.160
You watch a Good Will Hunting.

42:17.160 --> 42:19.000
You watch a Good Will Hunting.

42:19.000 --> 42:21.240
Or you watch a Stand and Deliver.

42:21.240 --> 42:23.640
Or you watch that other one.

42:23.640 --> 42:24.920
Here Comes the Boom.

42:24.920 --> 42:27.800
You watch that Here Comes the Boom with Kevin Smith.

42:27.800 --> 42:30.520
What happened with Kevin James, you dumbass?

42:30.520 --> 42:33.320
Kevin James versus Kevin Smith is the last fight.

42:33.880 --> 42:34.440
Last fight.

42:35.720 --> 42:40.280
It's just like two pieces of ham just swinging together.

42:40.280 --> 42:43.560
We decide to see Here Comes the Boom.

42:44.200 --> 42:45.800
Someone was making this choice.

42:45.800 --> 42:47.240
Paul Blart, I get it.

42:47.240 --> 42:48.600
I've got to see that.

42:48.600 --> 42:50.280
He's like, it's ridiculous.

42:50.280 --> 42:52.600
His name is so funny it sounds like fart.

42:52.600 --> 42:54.280
Like, I'm with you guys.

42:54.280 --> 42:55.080
I'm with you on that.

42:55.800 --> 42:57.400
But listen, back to my point.

42:57.400 --> 42:58.360
Okay, back to your point.

42:58.360 --> 42:59.640
Where's Blart too?

42:59.640 --> 43:01.320
You watch these films.

43:01.320 --> 43:04.440
These teachers, they know their fucking students so much.

43:04.440 --> 43:05.640
And they use that shit.

43:06.680 --> 43:07.720
Okay, all right, here we go.

43:07.720 --> 43:09.560
Finding Forrester, right?

43:09.560 --> 43:11.960
Which is the unofficial sequel to Good Will Hunting.

43:11.960 --> 43:13.000
Finding Forrester.

43:13.000 --> 43:16.680
Sean Connery had a hard time connecting with his youth.

43:16.680 --> 43:17.560
You know what I mean?

43:17.560 --> 43:19.960
Trying to teach him how to write, trying to express.

43:19.960 --> 43:24.200
So he learns some terms of phrase that he would use

43:24.200 --> 43:25.800
when he was playing basketball.

43:25.800 --> 43:27.560
Like, you're the man now, dog.

43:27.560 --> 43:29.560
And punch the keys for God's sakes.

43:30.120 --> 43:34.760
Both of which are catch phrases that they would use

43:34.760 --> 43:36.040
with his friends.

43:36.040 --> 43:36.680
You know what I mean?

43:36.680 --> 43:37.480
He connected with him.

43:37.480 --> 43:40.040
He formed an honest, earnest connection.

43:40.040 --> 43:43.080
And then he taught him how to punch the keys for God's sakes.

43:43.080 --> 43:48.760
I am so, do you know how close you're the man now, dog,

43:48.760 --> 43:55.000
was to slipping off of my mind table for like forever?

43:55.000 --> 43:57.480
And you have just saved me from that terrible fate

43:57.480 --> 43:59.720
because that is flooding back to me now.

43:59.720 --> 44:02.360
And it is really funny that he said that.

44:02.360 --> 44:04.200
It is really great.

44:04.200 --> 44:07.800
It is quite possibly the funniest line in cinematic history.

44:07.800 --> 44:10.120
It is hard to top.

44:10.120 --> 44:11.080
You're the man now, dog.

44:11.080 --> 44:11.880
You're the man now, dog.

44:11.880 --> 44:13.400
You're the man now, dog.

44:13.400 --> 44:14.920
You're the man now, dog.

44:14.920 --> 44:16.200
Isn't that what you say?

44:17.160 --> 44:20.920
Can we make another Highlander before he dies, please?

44:20.920 --> 44:22.360
Please, I'll give anything.

44:22.360 --> 44:24.280
Just make a dozen more things.

44:24.280 --> 44:27.000
But that connection is what I'm saying.

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
And Facebook can facilitate that.

44:29.000 --> 44:31.320
You can sit down with somebody and be like,

44:31.320 --> 44:35.000
yeah, I know, Evanescence, let's talk about your math.

44:35.000 --> 44:38.200
And then they're more receptive to your math advice.

44:38.200 --> 44:43.480
Griffin, watch like any special on Lifetime or 60 Minutes

44:43.480 --> 44:46.920
or True Investigations, whatever,

44:46.920 --> 44:49.640
the stories that involve teachers and students

44:49.640 --> 44:53.880
that begin with, and then the two connected on Facebook,

44:53.880 --> 44:56.760
never end with like, and she got an A.

44:56.760 --> 44:57.800
Well, that's the thing.

44:57.800 --> 44:59.400
They can never know.

44:59.400 --> 45:01.720
And that makes it creepier, I confess.

45:01.720 --> 45:04.200
But they can never know that they got an A.

45:04.200 --> 45:07.240
And never know that you know about their Evanescence love

45:07.240 --> 45:08.840
because you creeped on their soc.

45:08.840 --> 45:11.720
It sounds like you're saying to lean into it.

45:11.720 --> 45:14.360
I'm saying either run the fuck away

45:14.360 --> 45:16.040
or lean into it on the sneaky creep.

45:16.040 --> 45:17.880
Regardless, you tell your girlfriend,

45:17.880 --> 45:19.720
like, you're right, it is creepy, I'm gonna stop.

45:19.720 --> 45:21.080
And then you do it in secret

45:21.080 --> 45:23.240
because you gotta make those Finding Forrester connections.

45:23.240 --> 45:24.360
It's so important.

45:24.360 --> 45:25.480
Honey, you don't understand.

45:25.480 --> 45:26.280
I gotta shape them.

45:27.080 --> 45:28.120
I gotta shape them.

45:28.120 --> 45:29.080
These are my children.

45:30.280 --> 45:31.240
These are my babies.

45:31.240 --> 45:33.320
I gotta, they're like my little eggs.

45:33.320 --> 45:35.720
I don't know why it went from like a Sean Connery impression

45:35.720 --> 45:37.640
to like a Nicolas Cage impression.

45:37.640 --> 45:42.920
Man, that movie would've been so, so, so, so much better

45:42.920 --> 45:44.440
with Nicolas Cage in it.

45:44.440 --> 45:46.440
Oh my God, it's not even close

45:46.440 --> 45:47.880
to how much better that movie would've been.

45:47.880 --> 45:49.240
Man now, dog.

45:49.240 --> 45:50.520
Hey, hey, man.

45:52.760 --> 45:54.760
Hey, which one of your men is the dog?

45:57.560 --> 46:00.040
And also Tim Allen is there as the shaggy dog.

46:00.040 --> 46:01.640
There is the shaggy dog.

46:01.640 --> 46:04.200
Oh God, I wanna write this movie, an invisible baby.

46:04.200 --> 46:06.360
So Tim Allen's the shaggy dog.

46:06.360 --> 46:08.360
John Travolta is there as old dogs.

46:09.880 --> 46:11.800
And they're all riding robot horses.

46:11.800 --> 46:14.440
DDL, DDL's in the mix, or is he?

46:14.440 --> 46:15.560
Because he's an invisible baby.

46:17.240 --> 46:19.560
Nick Cage is there and he's a teacher

46:19.560 --> 46:21.640
who's probably cocaine addled.

46:21.640 --> 46:23.880
That's a subtext I feel like that runs through,

46:24.520 --> 46:26.920
runs underneath like the sewer system

46:26.920 --> 46:29.160
of every film that Nicolas Cage is in.

46:29.160 --> 46:30.760
And the movie's called Bad Lieutenant,

46:30.760 --> 46:32.440
but now he's also a teacher.

46:32.440 --> 46:34.280
From now on, I think instead of saying

46:34.280 --> 46:35.560
Hollywood is out of ideas,

46:35.560 --> 46:37.080
people should just start saying

46:37.080 --> 46:39.080
Hollywood doesn't listen to my bim bam.

46:39.080 --> 46:43.800
Because it's like we have opened wide our blast doors

46:43.800 --> 46:47.480
waiting for your lightsabers of cinematic ingenuity

46:47.480 --> 46:48.920
to tear us wide open.

46:49.640 --> 46:50.520
Oh God.

46:50.520 --> 46:51.400
Oh Jesus.

46:51.400 --> 46:53.240
That's gonna stay with me.

46:54.360 --> 46:55.400
That imagery.

46:55.400 --> 46:57.960
It is like a spicy hot dog.

46:57.960 --> 47:00.760
And the taste of it will linger.

47:00.760 --> 47:01.880
Oh wait, what?

47:01.880 --> 47:02.760
Oh, what?

47:03.720 --> 47:04.220
Yeah.

47:05.560 --> 47:07.080
Wait, did you just have a seizure?

47:09.720 --> 47:12.040
I was wondering if you meant like Hollywood's dick

47:12.040 --> 47:13.320
was like a spicy hot dog or like...

47:14.440 --> 47:16.360
Hollywood's dick is a spicy hot dog.

47:17.320 --> 47:19.160
That's a spicy meatball.

47:21.720 --> 47:22.600
You guys know that one?

47:22.600 --> 47:23.800
Time to make the donuts.

47:23.800 --> 47:27.560
Do they want to add?

47:28.600 --> 47:29.240
We got it.

47:30.040 --> 47:32.040
Cut, print, that's a wrap.

47:32.040 --> 47:32.760
That's a wrap.

47:32.760 --> 47:35.960
That's a great podcast that everyone can enjoy.

47:35.960 --> 47:37.800
You are getting Adele, right?

47:40.280 --> 47:42.200
Dude, you just met Adele.

47:43.800 --> 47:46.680
Dude, you got Adele tickets.

47:49.880 --> 47:51.000
Dude, you're Adele.

47:51.000 --> 47:54.280
Adele, and I really enjoyed that song, Skyfall.

47:55.400 --> 47:56.280
The Skymall.

47:57.480 --> 47:59.800
Stop, end, stop it, end it.

47:59.800 --> 48:00.600
There you go, Weird Al.

48:01.240 --> 48:01.960
Cut it.

48:01.960 --> 48:03.320
You are welcome.

48:03.320 --> 48:06.120
I know that you are constantly on the lookout for your ideas.

48:06.120 --> 48:07.240
Skymall, welcome.

48:07.240 --> 48:09.080
Hollywood doesn't listen to Bim Bam.

48:09.080 --> 48:10.840
Weird Al doesn't listen to Bim Bam.

48:11.800 --> 48:13.560
We're opening the doors for you.

48:14.280 --> 48:15.560
It's all there.

48:15.560 --> 48:17.160
Just come pick these lilies.

48:17.160 --> 48:18.440
This has been my brother, My Brother and Me.

48:18.440 --> 48:21.320
It's an advice show for the modern era.

48:21.320 --> 48:24.680
We hope you've enjoyed whatever that was.

48:25.560 --> 48:28.680
We are here every Monday, usually.

48:29.240 --> 48:32.760
And we really appreciate people tweeting about the show,

48:32.760 --> 48:37.880
like Jan Villarosa, Emily Nancy Jean, Mark Payne,

48:37.880 --> 48:44.280
Bat Manson, David Meowie, Shane Element, Tickerburn.

48:45.880 --> 48:46.760
Sorry, what?

48:46.760 --> 48:48.520
Tickerburn?

48:48.520 --> 48:48.920
I don't know.

48:49.720 --> 48:51.480
Is it just all consonants?

48:51.480 --> 48:53.240
Owen McBride, yes.

48:53.240 --> 48:56.680
Owen McBride, Platt, Raymond News.

48:56.680 --> 48:57.400
Oliver Platt.

48:58.680 --> 49:00.600
Oliver Platt, in my dreams.

49:01.320 --> 49:03.720
So thank you to everybody who's tweeting.

49:03.720 --> 49:09.400
If you do tweet about the show, throw in a link to our sampler.

49:09.400 --> 49:11.880
It's bit.ly forward slash it's my Bim Bam.

49:12.760 --> 49:14.280
When is that sequel coming?

49:14.280 --> 49:16.760
I feel like it's really brewing.

49:16.760 --> 49:17.960
It's getting close.

49:17.960 --> 49:19.800
If only it were up to us.

49:19.800 --> 49:20.200
I know.

49:22.040 --> 49:23.880
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters

49:23.880 --> 49:26.440
for the use of our theme song, which is It's a Departure,

49:26.440 --> 49:29.160
which is off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

49:31.240 --> 49:33.480
It's just, you know, you ever listen to the radio

49:33.480 --> 49:36.440
and you're like, this isn't my rock and roll.

49:37.880 --> 49:39.400
This is your rock and roll.

49:39.400 --> 49:40.040
You know what I mean?

49:40.760 --> 49:41.720
Absolutely.

49:41.720 --> 49:46.360
It's rock and roll for equestrian fanatics like ourselves and like you.

49:46.360 --> 49:47.640
It says that in the liner notes.

49:48.280 --> 49:52.600
Also, it is such an exciting time over at Max Fun headquarters.

49:52.600 --> 49:55.960
We just added two new shows to the Max Fun lineup.

49:55.960 --> 50:00.920
One Bad Mother with Theresa Thorn and the Dave Hill podcasting incident.

50:01.880 --> 50:02.520
It's epic.

50:02.520 --> 50:03.160
So check it out.

50:03.160 --> 50:08.600
I'm so thrilled that we are linked even tangentially to Dave Hill.

50:08.600 --> 50:09.640
I think he's hysterical.

50:09.640 --> 50:12.520
Do you guys want a final?

50:12.520 --> 50:12.840
Yeah.

50:14.600 --> 50:15.400
Lay it on us, big man.

50:17.240 --> 50:18.520
You're the man now, dog.

50:18.520 --> 50:20.200
Oh, you beat me to it.

50:20.200 --> 50:20.680
Damn you.

50:20.680 --> 50:23.400
You're the man now, dog.

50:23.400 --> 50:24.120
Wait, damn it.

50:25.800 --> 50:27.400
Make these fucking donuts, Griffin.

50:27.400 --> 50:27.720
Come on.

50:30.120 --> 50:32.360
It is past daylight savings time to make the donuts.

50:32.360 --> 50:33.240
Griffin, where's the beef?

50:35.080 --> 50:36.280
That was so good.

50:36.280 --> 50:37.320
Who's the beef?

50:37.320 --> 50:38.760
Who's the man now, dog?

50:38.760 --> 50:40.040
I'm stuck.

50:41.800 --> 50:44.280
We have to pay so many licensing fees.

50:46.200 --> 50:48.920
Darlene, we have to talk about this podcast you recommended to me.

50:49.800 --> 50:51.000
I did not enjoy it.

50:52.040 --> 50:53.480
They talked about earning horses with Dragon Relay.

50:53.480 --> 50:57.400
I am going to come to your houses and eat your fucking computers.

50:57.400 --> 50:59.800
I'm going to eat your fucking computers nut by bolt.

51:00.760 --> 51:02.280
Time to make the computers.

51:02.280 --> 51:03.720
This one is sent in by Ira Ray.

51:03.720 --> 51:04.520
Thank you, Ira Ray.

51:04.520 --> 51:09.960
It's by Yahoo Answers user Alice Chaos, who asks, Goofus or Gallant?

51:09.960 --> 51:10.760
Who is hotter?

51:14.200 --> 51:15.560
I'm Justin McElroy.

51:15.560 --> 51:16.760
I'm Travis McElroy.

51:16.760 --> 51:17.720
I'm Griffin McElroy.

51:17.720 --> 51:18.920
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

51:18.920 --> 51:19.880
Kiss your dad.

51:19.880 --> 51:35.800
