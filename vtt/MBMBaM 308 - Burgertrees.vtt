00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:46.800
Hello everybody, welcome to My Brother My Brother and Me,

00:46.800 --> 00:50.240
an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

00:50.240 --> 00:54.560
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy. I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

00:54.560 --> 01:00.560
Justin McElroy. And who are some good dads that you know? Let's hear it for the daddies.

01:02.320 --> 01:08.080
Let's give the daddies hands. This is our special show. Give them hands?

01:08.720 --> 01:13.760
Give the daddies hands for their special day. This is a daddy episode all about daddies. We're

01:13.760 --> 01:18.400
taking your daddy questions live on the air. Are you a daddy? Do you know a daddy? Is there a

01:18.400 --> 01:23.440
special daddy in your life? I'm on a website right now called Daddy Chat, and I'm just sort

01:23.440 --> 01:28.000
of like looking. A lot of messages coming in through Daddy Chat right now, and a lot of them,

01:28.000 --> 01:31.920
I would say, are of a surprisingly explicit nature. Well, just let them know that you're

01:31.920 --> 01:39.200
looking for a special daddy who will take care of you and see what they say. Our dad is, of course,

01:39.200 --> 01:44.960
here. We have not provided him with a microphone, but I can tell you he's on my end and just

01:44.960 --> 01:50.240
laughing along and just really savoring every second of it. Hi, daddy. Quick question. I feel

01:50.240 --> 01:54.960
like there's a cipher I'm missing, some sort of codex. You know in National Treasure Book of

01:54.960 --> 01:58.720
Secrets, they find the magic magnifying glass, and that lets them read. That's our dad's favorite

01:58.720 --> 02:04.640
movie. Yeah, it lets them read the other Declaration of Independence on the back of the

02:04.640 --> 02:09.040
other one, and it says, this one's just kidding about the gun stuff. Because it mentions a lot

02:09.040 --> 02:13.040
of that in the Declaration of Independence. A lot of this is getting away from me, but you know

02:13.040 --> 02:17.120
what I'm talking about? A cipher, like a codex. I feel like I'm missing one of those to really

02:17.120 --> 02:21.840
enjoy the daddy chat experience, because they keep mentioning something called cummies?

02:23.280 --> 02:28.880
Cummies? Or coomies? Do they mean gummies? Is it an autocorrect thing? If it's an autocorrect thing,

02:28.880 --> 02:36.800
then it's autocorrecting everyone. Weird. That's weird. Weird. That's so weird. Maybe they're a big

02:36.800 --> 02:44.080
fan of- Oh, is this like- Was there a gummy bear named Daddy Bear? Maybe that's it. Maybe this is

02:44.080 --> 02:49.360
like a- It's about the gummy bears. Maybe they're trying to say curries, and it's like autocorrecting

02:49.360 --> 02:57.360
like way off. Maybe that's it. We're talking about some of our best dads. Who's your favorite dad?

02:57.360 --> 03:02.080
I gotta get the fuck off daddy chat. Yeah, I think it's broken bad. I think it might be a sex thing

03:03.120 --> 03:13.360
about pork and dads. I'm not into that. Here's some- Trav, I'm gonna name a word, and you tell

03:13.360 --> 03:20.400
me the best one of those words. The five best of that word that you can think of. It's the easiest

03:20.400 --> 03:29.040
game I've ever played. Top blank that. Oh, I gotcha. Okay. The first word that I want you to

03:29.040 --> 03:35.760
rank the top five of is dads. Okay. The daddiest dads? Is that what I'm doing here? Top five dads.

03:35.760 --> 03:44.160
Top five dads. We'll go five to first order. Okay. Fifth, that would be Henry Jones Sr.

03:45.040 --> 03:49.760
Correct. Griffin, number four. Oh, I was gonna do all of them. That's all right. Number four,

03:49.760 --> 03:56.320
Joseph Gordon Lovett. Congratulations JGL on your baby and your promising movie career

03:56.320 --> 04:05.440
on both sides of the camera lens. Number three is Austin Powers Sr. Correct. That's good too.

04:06.000 --> 04:11.520
Okay. Griffin, number two dad of all time. Number two dad is of course French Stewart,

04:11.520 --> 04:16.800
also from Third Rock from The Sun. Congratulations French Stewart. You're doing a great job and we're

04:16.800 --> 04:23.920
all thinking about you today. On this special day. Travis McElroy, who is the number one dad

04:23.920 --> 04:31.440
of all time? Oh, number one dad. Number one dad. I'm gonna say James Bond Sr. Well, I'm gonna say

04:31.440 --> 04:37.440
our dad. Have fun at Christmas, dipshit. Our dad is James Bond Sr. and you can't prove otherwise.

04:37.440 --> 04:41.360
You're not gonna get any presents this year, Travis. You know that's what dad bases the

04:41.360 --> 04:48.000
present distribution off of. Santa delivers presents, stupid. Santa is an amazing daddy.

04:48.000 --> 04:54.480
Santa is. He is. Like he raised Frank Claus. Look how he turned out. This is our vice show.

04:56.080 --> 04:59.920
I don't know why I started saying it like that, like a poorly conceived SNL character,

04:59.920 --> 05:04.640
but this is our vice show where we take your questions and turn them out like in wisdom.

05:05.360 --> 05:09.760
We had a great, I want to say because we haven't recorded a new episode since. As you might be

05:09.760 --> 05:13.520
able to tell from a little bit of the rust. A little bit of the rust, the grime. A lot of

05:13.520 --> 05:18.960
Paul Rust on this machine. We're gonna get back in the swing of things, but I did want to say a

05:18.960 --> 05:25.200
huge thank you to everybody who came out to our New York and DC shows. They were just a hoot and

05:25.200 --> 05:32.160
a half really. We had a blast and thanks to the people who, like thanks to Hodgman for coming out

05:32.160 --> 05:37.440
and performing in our New York show and Still Buffering and Sawbones and everybody. So the

05:37.440 --> 05:41.440
Schmanners, everybody who helped make their shows so much fun. Of course you who came out,

05:41.440 --> 05:45.040
we really appreciate you. And as long as we're touching on stuff that we didn't get to talk

05:45.040 --> 05:51.280
about, I snuck up to Max Funcon West, which was, as always, super fun. And the macros are going

05:51.280 --> 05:55.520
to be at Max Funcon East and there's still a couple tickets available for that. We would

05:55.520 --> 06:03.680
like to see you there in September in what may be a haunted, shining-esque hotel in the Poconos

06:04.480 --> 06:08.560
in September. We would like to see you there. If you haven't been to Max Funcon before,

06:08.560 --> 06:13.520
it's amazing. It's really, really amazing. It's gonna be a hoot. And like literally all of our,

06:14.480 --> 06:22.160
like a brood, a large chunk of our families will be there. Go to maxfuncon.com right now

06:22.160 --> 06:28.240
and you can come see that. I have a question for you all and it comes from one of our listeners.

06:28.240 --> 06:30.480
The question goes a little something like this.

06:30.480 --> 06:39.680
It goes like this. It goes like this. I'm a Waluigi. This question is written in a special

06:39.680 --> 06:53.360
pervert font. This is all dildos. It's Comic Sins. Okay, first question. Brothers, I just sat down

06:53.360 --> 06:59.920
to do some work at Starbucks. The guy at the next table is clearly sketching me in this

06:59.920 --> 07:07.120
notebook. Jesus. I really need to get some work done, but it's very distracting. What do I do?

07:07.120 --> 07:11.200
I tried giving him a direct stare down, but no luck. He was probably gized about that. Like,

07:11.200 --> 07:16.640
oh, thank goodness. This is much better. And if I do stay here, do I look at the finished product

07:16.640 --> 07:21.840
over his shoulder as I leave? And that's from Begrudging Model in Boston. Holy shit. First off,

07:21.840 --> 07:25.040
I wish you'd save this for our live show in Boston next month. This would be fantastic.

07:25.040 --> 07:31.280
Yeah, Dan, this would have been a club banger. Here's the thing. The one situation in which

07:31.280 --> 07:39.440
this would be acceptable is if you are in Paris and it's like, oh, how wonderful. It's like that

07:39.440 --> 07:44.240
scene in Before Sunset where the guy's like, hello, I made the poem for you, milkshake.

07:44.240 --> 07:49.840
And it's like, dude, fucking cool it, please. I'm just like walking around all night. I'm super tired.

07:49.840 --> 07:55.200
Can you not poem me right now, bro? There was a dude who walked up to me on the streets of

07:55.200 --> 08:00.800
Cincinnati and said, for a dollar, I'll do a rap on you. And I gave him that dollar.

08:00.800 --> 08:05.840
It was not a good rap. It was okay. But I don't feel like you really touched on the

08:05.840 --> 08:11.040
cornerstones of what makes me me. Yeah, sure. You get what you pay for. Yeah, it was a dollar, bud.

08:11.600 --> 08:17.200
I mean, that's true. You should ask if he had a $5 plan available with better raps.

08:17.200 --> 08:22.240
Is there like a VIP rap that I can pay for where you follow me around for a year and really

08:22.240 --> 08:27.120
construct an in-depth narrative of my life? How much does it cost for the good rhymes?

08:28.560 --> 08:33.920
Give me your dank rhymes. Good, sir. A few ways to combat this, I'm just thinking of off the top

08:33.920 --> 08:39.120
of my head, shine a very bright light in their eyes so they can't draw. If you don't want to

08:39.120 --> 08:42.240
be aggressive about it, you could just move your body around a whole lot so you don't really get

08:42.240 --> 08:46.000
a bead on your ankles. Just keep turning your head, move your fingers around, because that's

08:46.000 --> 08:52.240
the trickiest part, as everyone knows, is fingers. While you were doing some work at Starbucks,

08:52.240 --> 08:58.400
is it possible that you were nude and covering your frame with various fig leaves? Because if

08:58.400 --> 09:05.280
that's the case, then I think- Are you a bowl of fruit? Are you a bowl of fruit is a good question,

09:05.280 --> 09:09.920
Travis. What the question asker didn't mention is that the work that they were doing in Starbucks

09:09.920 --> 09:15.040
was modeling. They were smizing and they were stretching out like languorously, like practicing

09:15.040 --> 09:20.320
their form. That's a good fucking point, Justin, is if they were a model, that shit isn't free.

09:20.320 --> 09:26.080
You can't just walk up to Ty Ty and just snap pics, because you actually, guess what? You need

09:26.080 --> 09:30.640
to pay tens of thousands of dollars in order to do that. Do you know what I mean? You can't just

09:30.640 --> 09:36.240
snap or draw a model. They work fucking hard. Here's what you do. While you're working on your

09:36.240 --> 09:42.320
screenplay, and this dude's drawing you, you start writing a scene in which a guy is drawing you,

09:42.320 --> 09:48.080
and the scene is about what a jerk he is, and then you just slowly turn the screen to him and

09:48.080 --> 09:52.560
point at it so he can read it. And if he gets offended by, oh, you were drawing me and I was

09:52.560 --> 09:56.400
writing you, how's it feel? How's it feel, Picasso? And then you walk out.

09:56.400 --> 10:02.000
I think their job is that they're a comics writer, and you work the whole time on a word bubble to

10:02.000 --> 10:06.000
put over their picture, and then you go over and try to very confidently with the word bubble you

10:06.000 --> 10:10.320
cut out and just put a word bubble coming out of your mouth like, what, me worry?

10:10.320 --> 10:17.040
Coming this July from the McElroy brothers. Rent two. It's really shitty this time. It's like

10:17.040 --> 10:22.480
super duper shitty. Can't we have a partnership on our hands? You know what I was just thinking

10:22.480 --> 10:26.160
about is that this scenario that is being described from this perspective is obviously

10:26.160 --> 10:31.920
like so baffling and insane, right? It's bad. But I bet, but if you look at the inverse of it,

10:31.920 --> 10:37.280
you could definitely see the artist here, you could see like their instructor being like,

10:37.280 --> 10:40.640
it doesn't matter what you're drawing. You just need to get out there and draw. If you're at the

10:40.640 --> 10:45.040
cafe, if you're at Starbucks, just whip out your notepad and draw the people around you.

10:45.040 --> 10:52.320
It's about drawing life. They don't really think about the repercussions of that actually doing

10:52.320 --> 10:57.840
that. I agree with you, Justin. I agree with you right up until the point that they give them a

10:57.840 --> 11:04.800
full stare down, and it's just like, hmm, I see you. And at that point, the artist continues to

11:04.800 --> 11:12.000
do it, but the artist already started on it. What do you want him to do? Put like a droopy

11:12.000 --> 11:19.280
dog face on it? No, it wasn't you. Well, it's her hair, but his face because she stared at me halfway

11:19.280 --> 11:25.200
through. Yeah. Do you guys want to Yahoo? I would love that. This one was sent in by level 9000

11:25.200 --> 11:31.040
Yajujuru Drew Davenport. Sorry, there is a banner ad for an iced caramel macchiato at the top of this

11:31.040 --> 11:33.760
Yahoo page. I'm actually going to refresh it. Everybody knows it's from Drew Davenport,

11:33.760 --> 11:37.600
right? Okay, I can refresh it. Try and get rid of that ad because it was making my mouth just like,

11:38.640 --> 11:42.800
it was just, I think I was having cummies. I don't know what that means yet, but I-

11:44.320 --> 11:47.200
You probably shouldn't announce that you're having it until you figure out what it is.

11:47.200 --> 11:51.200
Okay, it's fair. Yahoo answers user Ivan asked this one who says,

11:52.720 --> 11:58.400
how was Snoop Dogg able to smoke for so long without getting arrested?

11:58.400 --> 12:04.560
This is an excellent question if you really ponder it, because during E3, the video games,

12:05.520 --> 12:10.320
America's premier video games showcase, which Justin and I covered last week, there was a

12:10.320 --> 12:15.520
Battlefield 1 event where all the big names and big celebrities came out to play Battlefield 1

12:15.520 --> 12:21.680
against each other and Zac Efron and Jamie Foxx were there and Snoop Dogg was there and they were

12:21.680 --> 12:25.120
talking about how they were going to smoke so much weed while they play Battlefield and then there

12:25.120 --> 12:32.800
was a camera on Snoop Dogg while he smoked weed playing Battlefield. And that's like, that's not

12:33.520 --> 12:38.000
legal, right? And yet, and yet I feel like there's lots of situations where Snoop Dogg's just like,

12:38.720 --> 12:43.360
I'm gonna have this weed now and everyone's like, that's okay, that's okay for you, for you to do.

12:44.240 --> 12:49.760
No, okay, but wait, it was in California, right? That's fair, that's fair. Okay, but extrapolate

12:49.760 --> 12:55.040
then fucking Willie Nelson rolls up to Austin and he's like, as long as he's touching the statue of

12:55.040 --> 12:59.040
himself on 2nd Street in Austin, Texas, he can light up the biggest spliff ever and people are

12:59.040 --> 13:03.680
just like, that's, it's him. No, no, no, you're missing it. No, no, no, you don't, you are the

13:03.680 --> 13:09.120
one missing it because he's the weed man. He's the weed man so he's allowed to, fucking Fiona

13:09.120 --> 13:13.760
Apple comes and she's gonna play a show for me and my wife in Austin, but on the way she gets

13:13.760 --> 13:17.600
pulled over in town in Texas, has a little bit of weed on her, gets arrested, cancels the show.

13:17.600 --> 13:22.800
Well, that's Fiona Apple. If she had a big old box of apples, that would be okay.

13:22.800 --> 13:29.040
But the thing is, the thing is, is you're missing out that both Snoop Dogg and Willie Nelson are so

13:29.040 --> 13:36.320
good at weed at this point. They smoke it so good and so fast that the human eye can no longer

13:36.320 --> 13:42.400
comprehend that they are smoking weed. So like the authorities have been trying to catch Snoop Dogg

13:42.400 --> 13:50.400
forever and they're like, he said, he get, like, this is like, like old style gangster, like 1920s

13:50.400 --> 13:56.240
level, like he told them when he was gonna do it, where he was gonna do it, how he was gonna do it.

13:56.240 --> 14:01.600
And this is like, now you see me three, you had, everybody was looking at Snoop Dogg. They know

14:01.600 --> 14:07.120
he smoked the weed, but when Griffin, but when. On the camera, there's foot, you don't see, you're

14:07.120 --> 14:14.720
Moving pictures. There's a moving digital audio video. But if you go frame by frame, you never

14:14.720 --> 14:20.560
actually see the weed touch his mouth. And yet he did it, Griffin. How? Through his fingers? Through

14:20.560 --> 14:26.720
his what? Did he put it in his ear? I don't even know. The thing about it is, if you do anything

14:26.720 --> 14:32.880
hard enough, eventually they're just gonna let you. Yeah. Like my best example of this is Don

14:32.880 --> 14:40.160
Rickles. Don Rickles has been doing racist jokes for so long. For quite a long time. That he is the

14:40.160 --> 14:48.000
only person literally in the country that could just like drop it, like any, like whatever. Yeah.

14:48.000 --> 14:54.560
Like stuff that I can't even pretend to do as a joke here in like a pastiche of Mr. Rickles

14:54.560 --> 15:00.480
distinctive comedy. Like, because I would be literally crucified on a cross to death. Yes.

15:00.480 --> 15:05.920
Everybody looks at Don, he's like, that's how Don do. He just did it so hard. Nobody can stop him.

15:06.560 --> 15:14.640
What happened with Mr. Chong? He did get arrested for weed, right? But so like, when did he fall out?

15:14.640 --> 15:20.720
Like, is there only room for three people at the top? At the top of the ladder? Or it's just like,

15:20.720 --> 15:24.960
it's like the purge 24 seven for them. And Griffin, I'll pay you this picture. And Chong got

15:24.960 --> 15:30.880
bumped down off of it. I think you mean the purge for 20. This is how it went. There was a rookie

15:30.880 --> 15:35.840
cop first day on the job, first day on the beat. And like, well, they're having their morning cop

15:35.840 --> 15:41.520
meeting their morning staff meeting first day. Cop goes, Hey, shouldn't we arrest Tommy Chong?

15:41.520 --> 15:46.640
And everyone went, well, we can't, we can't do that. And he said, why not? And the everybody

15:46.640 --> 15:59.280
else went, uh, well, huh? What? Hey, everybody, why haven't we arrested Tommy Chong? He got arrested.

15:59.280 --> 16:04.000
He was selling a lot of paraphernalia, a lot. And he went to jail for nine months. That's fucking

16:04.000 --> 16:11.600
ridiculous. But according to Google, he lost, he forfeited about $120,000 in assets paid a fine of

16:11.600 --> 16:19.840
$20,000. This is combined loss of 140 K, but he also had to give up his internet domain name of

16:19.840 --> 16:26.640
tommychong.com. Let's just say, why? Yeah. I didn't know that was, I didn't know that was a thing that

16:26.640 --> 16:31.520
the America could take away from you. Like, so sorry, but it's gone now. You can't have

16:31.520 --> 16:37.440
travismacaroy.com anymore. You can't have it. You sold too many bongs, Mr. Chong. And so,

16:37.440 --> 16:40.880
Oh, that rhymes. That's fun. Have you ever thought about that? Mr. Chong? Anyway, nine months,

16:40.880 --> 16:46.960
give me your URL. Yoink. Back to back to go, daddy. You go whoosh, like throwing a fish back

16:46.960 --> 16:51.920
in the ocean. Wait, hold on. Is tommychong.com available for purchase? Well, now it redirects

16:51.920 --> 17:02.240
to his Facebook page. Oh, well, hold on. I'm going to buy it. Anyway, Snoop Dogg is, I'm not gonna

17:02.240 --> 17:10.720
play on his page is a link to his new product line, which is of course, you guessed it,

17:11.360 --> 17:17.760
Chong's Choice vaporizers. If you're gonna vape, vape with Chong. I believe I will. Thank you.

17:17.760 --> 17:22.400
Listen, I'm not, no, no tea, no shade, no pink lemonade. Legalize it. Go fucking. Yes, please,

17:22.400 --> 17:28.000
please, please. I'm just saying, like, I was at the event. I was at that battlefield event. I

17:28.000 --> 17:31.440
smelled the dupe. I smelled the duper. I smelled the duper. I was like, huh, that's weird. And

17:31.440 --> 17:35.920
later I found out the source of the duper. I was like, that makes very much sense. And,

17:35.920 --> 17:39.920
but you can think that you could just do it. If you're, if you're one of these three people,

17:39.920 --> 17:43.680
I hope that they're able to put a stop to this menace. Let's let's do a new question.

17:43.680 --> 17:47.600
By the way, someone sent a scoreboard from that celebrity match and who was at the top.

17:47.600 --> 17:53.760
You guessed it. Mr. Snoop Dogg. Maybe you can only arrest him if his KD starts jumping.

17:53.760 --> 17:58.080
Because like you can't legal. There's a, well, conviction wouldn't hold up. Cause look how

17:58.080 --> 18:03.120
fucking bad he's nose scoping everybody constantly. How, how does that guy front do?

18:03.120 --> 18:09.120
Cause that dude was fucking blazed out of his gourd. He's still playing. He did pretty good

18:09.120 --> 18:16.880
too. From what I heard that dude was Zamboni. Um, we are, uh, we're going to ask another question

18:16.880 --> 18:22.560
right now. I live in a small apartment in Brooklyn, New York with two roommates, one of whom uses an

18:22.560 --> 18:28.960
excessive amount of toilet paper. Okay. Just getting a text message here from my father. Can't

18:28.960 --> 18:33.120
can't mute it. Cause it's father's day. And if he needs me, I thought it was in the room.

18:33.120 --> 18:38.240
Fiction. You're a dad too. So it cancels out. That's true. Good point. I live in a small apartment

18:38.240 --> 18:42.160
in Brooklyn, New York with two roommates, one of whom uses an excessive amount of toilet paper.

18:42.160 --> 18:46.560
I'm not exaggerating when I say that she alone goes through at least two rolls alone in one day.

18:46.560 --> 18:50.160
No, you are exaggerating when you say that. Cause that's if that's true, then this person would be

18:50.160 --> 18:54.800
dead just from like all the fluid in their body being absorbed out of them by toilet paper. She

18:54.800 --> 19:00.240
might be cone heads eating it. Uh, I, it's not just that I'm curious about what she does with

19:00.240 --> 19:05.600
the toilet paper. I'm sick of writing 10 stops on the subway every week with 24 rolls of TP

19:05.600 --> 19:09.680
because she never buys her own. It's gotten to the point where I'm hiding my own secret TP

19:10.480 --> 19:14.240
so as not to be caught with my pants down. So to speak, how can I get her to use a reasonable amount

19:14.240 --> 19:20.080
of TP as from feeling shitty in the big city? I'm a little bit disappointed that you have already

19:20.080 --> 19:23.520
gotten to buy your own secret toilet paper. Cause that was going to be my opening salvo.

19:23.520 --> 19:29.520
Absolutely. It was going to be my opening salvo. Now, now I'm at like, um, get a little toilet

19:29.520 --> 19:33.040
paper size toolbox for yourself. You can probably fit three or four rolls in there and then put

19:33.040 --> 19:39.760
like a combination lock on it and then write like Gerald's dookie box on the top.

19:39.760 --> 19:43.760
See, that's too perfect. A TP fiend like this is going to find that instantly

19:43.760 --> 19:46.400
and they're going to bring their own lock picks or they're going to crack it. I say,

19:46.400 --> 19:52.480
you have to hide it in plain sight. Can you make, uh, curtains out of toilet paper in the bathroom?

19:52.480 --> 19:56.880
So like when you need a fix, it's like right there. And she's like, where does she get these

19:56.880 --> 20:02.000
wonderful toys? By which I mean toilet paper. Um, and you'll, you'll know your secret stash.

20:02.000 --> 20:05.760
It's right there in plain view. Two rolls in one day?

20:05.760 --> 20:09.040
Yeah. I mean, I'm still very much with you there, Travis, at the first,

20:09.040 --> 20:12.720
like it's hard for me to mount that first sentence. This is like American Ninja Warrior,

20:12.720 --> 20:17.920
only it starts off with the 12 and a half foot wall. And I just didn't have a really hard time

20:17.920 --> 20:20.400
scaling it so I can take on the other challenges on the course.

20:21.760 --> 20:29.280
That person alone is going through an entire package of toilet paper in like two weeks.

20:29.280 --> 20:32.080
What the fuck? I'm worried.

20:32.720 --> 20:38.480
This is, um, one of the problems with our nation's hangups about not discussing this kind of thing

20:38.480 --> 20:44.720
in public because maybe this person's just using a giganto wad because they think about this for a

20:44.720 --> 20:46.160
second. Okay.

20:46.160 --> 20:53.680
Unless somebody told you, like at what point in your life, if you're using like a giganto wad of

20:53.680 --> 21:01.040
toilet paper every time you beamed and, or number one, um, if you're using like a giganto wad,

21:01.040 --> 21:05.600
who would ever tell you, you don't need that much. You know what I mean?

21:05.600 --> 21:07.920
That's not like a life coach for this kind of thing.

21:07.920 --> 21:11.680
There's probably someone out there using one square who's going to listen to this like,

21:11.680 --> 21:14.960
oh fuck, I could use more squares.

21:14.960 --> 21:16.640
I'll put the tiger on the table and yell at it.

21:16.640 --> 21:20.160
Fucking first time I saw this Sharman commercial, it was like, it's so good.

21:20.160 --> 21:21.360
You only need two squares.

21:21.360 --> 21:22.880
I was like, is that?

21:23.520 --> 21:25.360
Hey, I looked at everybody in the room.

21:25.360 --> 21:29.440
I was like, hey everyone, is that the normal amount of squares?

21:30.000 --> 21:35.120
Cause I do, I'll be, I don't use a giganto wad, but I was using at that point maybe six or seven

21:35.120 --> 21:38.480
because I didn't want to, you know, I didn't want there to be any breach.

21:38.480 --> 21:43.360
I like use enough that I can trick myself into not feeling like I'm using my hand to wipe myself.

21:44.400 --> 21:44.880
Right.

21:44.880 --> 21:47.600
Which like, by the way, let's sidestep this whole question and say,

21:48.400 --> 21:52.960
get like a dope ass bidet installed and do things in the Japanese style, which would fix everything.

21:52.960 --> 21:56.560
Um, uh, I mean, you'd still need to, you would need like at least

21:56.560 --> 22:02.560
one to two squares just for a courtesy wipe, but is this, I don't, I hope this isn't too blue

22:02.560 --> 22:06.000
because I said I was going to put the tiger on the table and we need to confront some stuff

22:06.800 --> 22:09.840
as a nation because this person alone is going to like take down.

22:09.840 --> 22:11.440
Hey, do you remember sequoias?

22:11.440 --> 22:18.000
They used to exist because, but then Melissa just went ham with her beamers and her onesies.

22:19.200 --> 22:20.800
This is called the Melissa park.

22:20.800 --> 22:22.880
It's where the sequoias used to be.

22:22.880 --> 22:24.880
And now it's just Melissa's deforested.

22:24.880 --> 22:25.600
This is good.

22:25.600 --> 22:29.440
You, you confront Melissa and you say you can keep using as much toilet paper,

22:29.440 --> 22:32.640
but every month you have to plant a new tree.

22:32.640 --> 22:36.720
You like you, Melissa, this is like when you cut down a tree, you got to plant too.

22:37.600 --> 22:40.240
Like Melissa needs to start doing that.

22:40.240 --> 22:42.800
You need to find an area for Melissa to plant trees.

22:43.360 --> 22:46.640
And then someone sees Melissa planting like six trees and she's like,

22:46.640 --> 22:48.000
I don't know, Chipotle, right?

22:49.680 --> 22:50.320
It's a rough week.

22:50.320 --> 22:51.280
I went on a cruise.

22:51.280 --> 22:52.480
I don't know what to tell you.

22:52.480 --> 22:53.680
I don't know what to tell you.

22:53.680 --> 22:54.000
Okay.

22:54.880 --> 22:55.600
Oh man.

22:55.600 --> 23:01.200
Um, how do you start this dialogue?

23:02.560 --> 23:04.880
I think you can start it with like, I'm not mad.

23:04.880 --> 23:06.800
I'm extremely worried about you.

23:06.800 --> 23:07.040
Yeah.

23:08.080 --> 23:09.760
Um, I mean, I'd be mad also.

23:09.760 --> 23:10.720
I can be both.

23:10.720 --> 23:14.640
I'm, I'm mad and worried about both of you pretty much constantly.

23:15.440 --> 23:16.320
I'll tell you the truth.

23:16.320 --> 23:20.800
At this point, Melissa, Melissa is not, there's a good chance Melissa is not

23:20.800 --> 23:23.360
aware of where the toilet paper is coming from.

23:23.360 --> 23:25.040
Like she doesn't second guess it.

23:25.040 --> 23:26.160
She just uses it up.

23:26.160 --> 23:28.960
And then there's more cause you keep going and getting it.

23:28.960 --> 23:32.800
And if you went to Melissa and if you went to Melissa and we're like,

23:32.800 --> 23:36.960
Hey, straight up, you're using way too much, way too fast.

23:36.960 --> 23:39.040
And like, I have to go.

23:39.040 --> 23:40.960
Somebody has to go get it.

23:40.960 --> 23:42.320
Something's gotta give Melissa.

23:43.200 --> 23:43.520
Yeah.

23:44.480 --> 23:46.560
You gotta stop eating this like coneheads pasta.

23:48.160 --> 23:49.840
You have to be better, Melissa.

23:50.400 --> 23:51.840
You have to be better.

23:51.840 --> 23:54.720
Hey, how's your, how's your plumbing situation, gang?

23:54.720 --> 23:57.200
How's the, how's the pipes like at this house?

23:57.200 --> 23:58.640
Cause I bet they're not great.

23:58.640 --> 24:00.400
I bet it's not a not great scene.

24:00.400 --> 24:00.560
Yeah.

24:00.560 --> 24:05.120
I have to buy toilet paper every day, every waking day of my life.

24:05.120 --> 24:09.520
And also we spend $700 on plumbing every day.

24:10.160 --> 24:12.880
And my whole neighborhood is flooded constantly.

24:12.880 --> 24:15.680
The utilities are not great here in Atlantis.

24:17.040 --> 24:22.160
I think that you should, I think that you should brick over the bathroom door.

24:22.160 --> 24:25.600
I think you should cask of a Montelotto your own bathroom.

24:25.600 --> 24:29.280
And then when this person says, I'd like to use the bathroom, please.

24:29.280 --> 24:31.520
You say, we've never had a bathroom.

24:31.520 --> 24:33.040
That would be very expensive.

24:33.040 --> 24:35.840
Not everybody in New York can afford a bathroom.

24:35.840 --> 24:39.440
And you start going to bathroom and whatever establishment will have you.

24:39.440 --> 24:40.160
It's New York.

24:40.160 --> 24:42.640
There's a lot of different places with bathrooms.

24:42.640 --> 24:44.240
And you're gonna have to make that sacrifice

24:44.240 --> 24:46.000
if you really want to stop buying TP.

24:46.000 --> 24:47.200
It's your only option.

24:47.200 --> 24:54.480
Yeah, or you just fucking play the most high stakes game of chicken ever.

24:54.480 --> 24:56.080
And you don't buy TP anymore.

24:56.080 --> 24:58.000
You tell your other mate, no more buying TP.

24:58.000 --> 24:59.600
It's gonna be a lean week.

24:59.600 --> 25:03.600
You say to them, giving your good, giving your good roommate fair warning,

25:03.600 --> 25:05.520
but not telling your bad roommate anything.

25:05.520 --> 25:06.880
And your bad roommate, you'll be like,

25:08.160 --> 25:09.680
where's toilet claws?

25:09.680 --> 25:12.240
And you say, what the fuck did you just say?

25:12.240 --> 25:13.760
You know, toilet claws.

25:13.760 --> 25:15.680
He brings new TP every day.

25:15.680 --> 25:20.160
So I can use a big ginormo wad to feel comfortable.

25:20.160 --> 25:21.040
And you say that.

25:21.040 --> 25:24.160
Sometimes I just throw some away just so he'll come back.

25:24.720 --> 25:26.240
Hey, hold on a second.

25:26.240 --> 25:27.440
Something just occurred to me.

25:28.800 --> 25:34.720
You live with two roommates and one of them uses an excessive amount of toilet.

25:34.720 --> 25:35.840
One of them is toilet claws.

25:35.840 --> 25:49.200
What kind of QPRO work did you have to conduct to decipher exactly which one of the roommates

25:49.200 --> 25:52.160
was using an incongruous amount of toilet paper?

25:52.160 --> 25:56.480
What sort of like, I mean, CSI stuff had to happen?

25:56.480 --> 26:02.240
The only thing that makes sense is you go in to the junk room

26:02.240 --> 26:06.800
and you unspool one of those bad boys and you count each square.

26:07.440 --> 26:10.080
And then you wait for the trap to be sprung.

26:11.200 --> 26:17.040
And then when you come back and there's no toilet paper anywhere in the house anymore,

26:17.520 --> 26:21.920
after one bathroom visit from somebody, that was the one who did it.

26:22.480 --> 26:25.360
I put a human hair across this toilet paper.

26:25.920 --> 26:29.040
Also the toilet has flooded the entire city.

26:29.040 --> 26:32.400
Then it was that one who did that did the thing that was so bad.

26:32.400 --> 26:36.160
Could you start using more toilet paper?

26:36.800 --> 26:44.640
Could you somehow fix this problem by amping up your toilet paper to like even like twice

26:44.640 --> 26:46.160
what this person is doing?

26:46.160 --> 26:50.080
I'm talking about if you're mowing through four rolls a day until they're forced to start

26:50.080 --> 26:55.520
buying their own rolls of toilet paper, maybe they'll like start the conversation with you.

26:55.520 --> 26:58.080
If you're looking for like an easy way to get into it.

26:58.080 --> 26:59.360
Say, okay, I'll make you a deal.

26:59.360 --> 27:03.520
How about we all come back to one roll per day and that that way at least you're cutting

27:03.520 --> 27:04.560
them in half, right?

27:04.560 --> 27:05.760
Like that's progress.

27:05.760 --> 27:10.240
I would also argue that one roll a day is still excessive.

27:10.240 --> 27:12.000
Quite a bit, quite a bit.

27:14.400 --> 27:16.480
Is this what that song Big Yellow Taxi is about?

27:17.920 --> 27:19.840
This Yahoo was sent in by Christopher Lamp.

27:19.840 --> 27:20.640
Thank you, Christopher.

27:20.640 --> 27:25.040
It's by Yahoo Answers user consumer who asks,

27:25.040 --> 27:28.320
why can't we grow burger in tree?

27:30.720 --> 27:32.800
Why can't we grow burger in tree?

27:32.800 --> 27:33.360
What?

27:37.360 --> 27:39.440
Why can't we grow burger in tree?

27:39.440 --> 27:40.960
One more again.

27:40.960 --> 27:42.320
Why can't we grow burger in tree?

27:42.320 --> 27:45.280
It's a, it's you read it and you think, well, this is just goofy.

27:45.280 --> 27:48.320
But then you think about like, we got fucking Soylent now.

27:48.320 --> 27:52.880
We got fucking, you know, to real life to Mac.

27:52.880 --> 27:57.680
Oh, like the things are happening in the science space.

27:58.880 --> 28:00.560
Why can't we go burger?

28:00.560 --> 28:02.720
Why can't we go burger in tree?

28:02.720 --> 28:10.720
So in Big Top Pee Wee, there was definitely a bush that grew hot dog like cocktail Franks.

28:10.720 --> 28:11.040
Yes.

28:13.120 --> 28:13.920
Is that anything?

28:14.560 --> 28:16.080
Is that something?

28:16.080 --> 28:21.120
Does that get us closer to why can't we grow burger in tree?

28:21.120 --> 28:25.520
Oh, the question is, are we trying to grow fully constructed burgers?

28:25.520 --> 28:28.800
Is it okay if it's in pieces and you put it together yourself?

28:28.800 --> 28:29.120
Yeah, yeah.

28:29.120 --> 28:31.600
Can there be a bun tree, a burger tree?

28:31.600 --> 28:37.040
In this fucking fantasy world that we've created for ourselves where burger grow in tree,

28:37.040 --> 28:38.720
we still got to do a little bit of work.

28:39.280 --> 28:44.800
We still, we can't get, you know, we still got to cook the meat, for example.

28:44.800 --> 28:49.760
I'm just saying that science could probably tackle this easier if we're willing to do it in pieces

28:49.760 --> 28:53.520
rather than trying to grow fully formed, constructed, grilled.

28:53.520 --> 28:55.680
But are the burgers growing grilled?

28:55.680 --> 29:00.880
Okay, this is actually an excellent point, Travis, because let's say we did grow burger in tree.

29:00.880 --> 29:02.000
Okay, okay.

29:02.000 --> 29:02.320
All right.

29:04.720 --> 29:11.680
Try to think of an optimal point at which you would like a hamburger blossom to emerge, right?

29:11.680 --> 29:12.000
Yeah.

29:12.000 --> 29:17.120
If it emerged fully done and paddied out, it probably doesn't have the toppings you want on it.

29:17.120 --> 29:22.080
It would take forever to GMO the right toppings for everybody.

29:22.080 --> 29:24.640
So it would have to be designer for everybody.

29:24.640 --> 29:27.280
The cost of that would be astronomical.

29:27.280 --> 29:32.720
If it grew hot, you would have to pluck that baby right when it was fresh,

29:32.720 --> 29:34.960
or else you're going to be eating a stale old hamburger,

29:34.960 --> 29:36.560
which as anybody can tell you is terrible.

29:37.200 --> 29:40.240
If you grow them at their uncooked point,

29:40.240 --> 29:48.720
then you're talking about like a child sitting underneath the shade of their favorite burger tree,

29:48.720 --> 29:54.560
and then all of a sudden, like they're just reading, and then like, just all meat falls in there.

29:54.560 --> 29:57.680
Like all rotten meat falls in their head.

29:57.680 --> 29:58.720
That's not a good image.

29:58.720 --> 30:06.160
Now, devil's advocate, there is grosser stuff currently growing in trees right now, this minute, than old meat.

30:06.160 --> 30:13.360
I'm talking about an old crabapple falls on your head and just splonches down there and ruins the book you're reading.

30:13.360 --> 30:13.840
Hello.

30:14.800 --> 30:16.560
You're saying that's worse than a big slimy crabby patty falling on-

30:16.560 --> 30:18.800
Yeah, I'm not going to go with you on this one, Griffith.

30:18.800 --> 30:19.760
Yeah, no way.

30:19.760 --> 30:20.160
No way.

30:20.160 --> 30:20.880
That's the worst thing.

30:20.880 --> 30:24.640
A big old durian fruit falls out of a tree, hits the ground, splonk.

30:24.640 --> 30:25.680
How's the worst smell?

30:26.240 --> 30:27.920
It's not ideal.

30:28.480 --> 30:34.960
Maybe the answer is we go underground and we grow them like potatoes.

30:34.960 --> 30:43.040
Yes, so that way they're kept safe by the earth and you pull them up and maybe they're already foil wrapped.

30:44.480 --> 30:47.040
You plant them foil wrapped, hear me out.

30:47.040 --> 30:47.280
Okay.

30:47.280 --> 30:52.320
You plant the bulbs foil wrapped so that when the burger forms under the ground,

30:52.320 --> 30:54.720
it's already foil wrapped and ready for your consumption.

30:54.720 --> 30:56.400
You don't need to worry about worms or nothing.

30:56.400 --> 30:59.840
You guys are taking, and it's fun and we're having a really great time,

30:59.840 --> 31:07.760
but you guys are taking a Harry Potter fucking labyrinth fucking fantasy approach to this.

31:07.760 --> 31:13.600
Well, meanwhile, I'm over here googling just to make sure that the science is real on this one

31:13.600 --> 31:15.200
or it could be in my lifetime.

31:16.080 --> 31:16.640
You know what I mean?

31:17.360 --> 31:20.240
Maybe we could be a little bit more respectful.

31:20.240 --> 31:21.280
What's up, Trav?

31:21.280 --> 31:22.400
I've got it.

31:22.400 --> 31:28.640
As long as we're willing to bend our concept of burger a little bit,

31:28.640 --> 31:30.000
a black bean burger.

31:30.000 --> 31:30.960
It's right there.

31:30.960 --> 31:33.680
It's already vegetable based.

31:33.680 --> 31:34.720
Now we're cooking with gas.

31:34.720 --> 31:35.520
This is good.

31:35.520 --> 31:36.560
This is good progress.

31:38.640 --> 31:39.680
What am bread even?

31:39.680 --> 31:40.080
Wheat.

31:40.080 --> 31:40.880
Hello.

31:40.880 --> 31:41.360
Hello.

31:41.360 --> 31:43.120
Put some of that DNA in there.

31:44.160 --> 31:46.400
We grow the tomatoes in slice form.

31:47.280 --> 31:50.880
DNA is in everything and it informs what the thing is.

31:50.880 --> 31:53.120
Right now I'm looking at a cup, right?

31:53.120 --> 31:54.640
I'm looking at a cup and it's full of water.

31:54.640 --> 31:57.280
Obviously the water DNA is just H2O.

31:57.280 --> 31:58.880
Like we already cracked that one.

31:58.880 --> 32:03.680
The human DNA is like so complex and they won't figure that out until they, you know,

32:03.680 --> 32:05.040
stem cells is like good.

32:06.080 --> 32:07.600
But I'm looking at the cup right now.

32:07.600 --> 32:11.280
And the cup is just like, what are its tea cags at?

32:11.280 --> 32:13.280
And those are the letters that make up DNA.

32:13.280 --> 32:17.920
Because maybe if a few of them were different, it would be speakers,

32:17.920 --> 32:19.680
which is another thing that I'm just looking at right now.

32:19.680 --> 32:22.800
Or if there were a lot more of the DNA and they were in like a really specific place,

32:22.800 --> 32:23.840
it would be Griffin.

32:23.840 --> 32:24.400
It would be me.

32:24.400 --> 32:24.640
Exactly.

32:24.640 --> 32:25.600
The cup would be me.

32:25.600 --> 32:28.880
So like, I'm saying we take the seed and we put some of the wheat DNA.

32:28.880 --> 32:29.920
We put some of the black bean DNA.

32:29.920 --> 32:31.440
We put some of the mayonnaise DNA.

32:31.440 --> 32:35.200
That one's going to be tricky, but, and then there it is.

32:35.200 --> 32:36.000
Bob's your uncle.

32:37.040 --> 32:38.880
But is plant-based the way to go?

32:38.880 --> 32:44.080
Cause we could spice that DNA with say like a fish and we end up with like a burger shaped

32:44.080 --> 32:45.520
fish or a fish shaped burger.

32:47.200 --> 32:52.160
And maybe you're going to get more of the, you know, the proteins, more of the actual

32:52.160 --> 32:58.480
like goodness from like, if you had, I don't know, like you spliced it with maybe like

32:58.480 --> 32:59.600
a rat or something like that.

32:59.600 --> 33:01.440
Yeah, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

33:01.440 --> 33:02.160
That's horrible.

33:02.160 --> 33:04.720
Let's stick with the, let's keep it edible, huh?

33:04.720 --> 33:12.960
But what I don't like about the, including animal matter in the thing, I don't want to

33:12.960 --> 33:17.440
look up at a tree and see like a bunch of these guys just swinging around because they

33:17.440 --> 33:18.320
would be alive.

33:18.320 --> 33:19.680
It's like you'd walk to continue the analogy.

33:19.680 --> 33:21.840
Oh, that's too cloudy with a chance of meatball shit.

33:21.840 --> 33:29.120
Well, it would be like cloudy with a chance of horror when you look up and all of these

33:29.120 --> 33:30.480
burgers are definitely alive, right?

33:30.480 --> 33:34.080
Cause they're connected to the tree and the tree is just like, a tree is basically just

33:34.080 --> 33:35.360
fruit placenta.

33:35.360 --> 33:35.860
Yeah.

33:36.560 --> 33:38.720
And these guys would be just like flipping around, flopping around.

33:38.720 --> 33:45.200
So you're under the tree reading your, reading a book and then, but then there would be like

33:45.200 --> 33:49.840
just little yells, just little, little, little yelling sounds.

33:49.840 --> 33:56.640
We were really quick to dismiss this, but I feel like we needed to do a little bit of

33:56.640 --> 34:00.880
table setting before we even discussed the, the practicality of this.

34:00.880 --> 34:04.400
So I have a question for you two and I want you to answer me honestly.

34:04.400 --> 34:04.900
Okay.

34:05.200 --> 34:07.120
And 90s kids will love this one.

34:08.240 --> 34:09.360
Did you ever play in a burger?

34:11.520 --> 34:12.020
What?

34:13.360 --> 34:14.560
Did you ever play in a burger?

34:15.120 --> 34:16.560
I, I haven't.

34:17.280 --> 34:17.780
No.

34:18.240 --> 34:18.740
Huh.

34:18.740 --> 34:19.700
Hmm.

34:19.700 --> 34:20.820
It's interesting, isn't it?

34:20.820 --> 34:25.700
You just sort of took science at face value.

34:25.700 --> 34:31.140
You know, Gregor Mendel would have planted a hamburger because he wasn't satisfied with

34:31.140 --> 34:34.500
understanding DNA as well as we do today.

34:34.500 --> 34:35.540
He couldn't do that.

34:35.540 --> 34:37.380
He didn't have that luxury.

34:37.380 --> 34:39.860
So he had to start from ground zero.

34:39.860 --> 34:45.140
Number two was P's AGTC loving it.

34:45.140 --> 34:48.500
Like just learning, learning, growing, setting the standard.

34:48.500 --> 34:50.180
But before that, before that, before that.

34:50.180 --> 34:56.100
Directly before earlier that day, the one you people don't tell you about is he planted

34:56.100 --> 34:58.420
a burger and people were like, are you sure?

34:58.420 --> 34:59.860
And he's like, I don't know.

34:59.860 --> 35:01.940
But it starts with a question, doesn't it?

35:01.940 --> 35:03.300
Three, two, one contacts.

35:03.300 --> 35:04.420
Three, two, one contacts.

35:04.420 --> 35:04.980
Exactly.

35:04.980 --> 35:05.940
Bloodhound gang.

35:05.940 --> 35:06.900
This is what I'm saying.

35:06.900 --> 35:08.020
Travis gets it.

35:08.020 --> 35:09.220
90s kids.

35:09.220 --> 35:10.660
Did you ever play in a hamburger?

35:11.220 --> 35:16.020
How about, how about this television show that the three of us are unconsciously writing

35:16.020 --> 35:17.220
together right now?

35:17.220 --> 35:19.460
And it is the knack or the knick.

35:20.340 --> 35:24.340
These, these doctors have a knack for killing people.

35:25.140 --> 35:29.540
But it's like that where it's just like early science days, early science days, pre X-ray,

35:29.540 --> 35:30.660
just figuring the shit out.

35:31.700 --> 35:35.540
But instead of like doctors just like, I bet I can get that heart out of there plum quick.

35:35.540 --> 35:37.140
Oops, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

35:38.020 --> 35:39.060
It's Gregor Mendel.

35:39.060 --> 35:42.820
And he's like, I need, I would like two burgers.

35:42.820 --> 35:48.020
And so far, if most of this, some of the stuff you put in the ground, you get more of it

35:48.020 --> 35:51.220
out guys, duh, burger ground.

35:51.220 --> 35:54.980
I would like a, like kind of a montage of him like cutting a burger in half and floating

35:54.980 --> 35:57.460
it in a jar of water and looking for like roots.

35:57.460 --> 35:58.500
Just like, where is it?

35:58.500 --> 36:00.100
Where the root, oh, it needs more sunshine.

36:00.100 --> 36:01.700
And the show would be called The Dick.

36:04.260 --> 36:07.540
It's just Gregor Mendel, Mendel planting things.

36:07.540 --> 36:11.620
Well, that wouldn't be the only, that wouldn't be the only dumb experiment he does, but it

36:11.620 --> 36:13.300
would be, that's an episode right there.

36:13.300 --> 36:15.860
That's an episode that right, that one writes itself.

36:15.860 --> 36:18.020
Or maybe it's like Gregor Mendel's brother.

36:18.020 --> 36:22.180
And you like make Gregor Mendel a character who keeps coming and going, stop, just stop.

36:22.180 --> 36:23.380
What are you doing?

36:23.380 --> 36:24.260
Just stop.

36:24.260 --> 36:28.500
And then like the series finale spoiler is like, he does it and something grows.

36:28.500 --> 36:31.300
And you see like a little shoot of green credits.

36:34.100 --> 36:36.100
I think that this is like the-

36:36.100 --> 36:37.540
Coming soon to see so.

36:37.540 --> 36:39.300
Coming soon to see so, The Dick.

36:39.300 --> 36:41.060
The Dick, what?

36:41.060 --> 36:43.700
Hey, are we married to that name?

36:44.740 --> 36:46.740
Sorry, are you married to The Dick?

36:46.740 --> 36:48.580
Oh, you know I'm married to The Dick.

36:48.580 --> 36:50.100
I already got the Twitter handle.

36:50.100 --> 36:51.540
It's The Dick on Showtime.

36:51.540 --> 36:53.460
I was very optimistic about it.

36:53.460 --> 37:00.020
We pan up, lights up on Sandor Mendel and he is planting hamburgers everywhere.

37:00.020 --> 37:02.180
French fries, yeah, those worked.

37:02.180 --> 37:05.620
So he starts with French fries and he's like, okay, definitely these do work.

37:05.620 --> 37:10.340
So next up, maybe I'm gonna try a hamburger.

37:10.340 --> 37:13.380
And you're probably laughing at him, but there's probably somebody at home who's like,

37:13.380 --> 37:15.220
I wonder how this is gonna shake out.

37:15.220 --> 37:18.340
They wouldn't have made the show if there wasn't some end game to this.

37:18.340 --> 37:23.700
Episode two, Gregor Mendel ties a phone to a balloon so he can talk to God.

37:25.060 --> 37:27.380
No Greg, we're talking about Sandor Mendel.

37:27.380 --> 37:27.860
His little brother.

37:27.860 --> 37:28.740
Gregor's brother.

37:28.740 --> 37:31.940
Oh yes, he's great too, very funny.

37:32.740 --> 37:34.020
Very funny.

37:34.020 --> 37:38.820
I'm imagining sort of Joseph Gordon-Levitt mixed with French stir.

37:38.820 --> 37:42.820
Kind of like has the good, the pretty boy looks, but also the great comic timing.

37:42.820 --> 37:43.700
And the fucking bad boy.

37:43.700 --> 37:44.660
Which one are we talking about?

37:44.660 --> 37:46.500
Cause they're both funny and they're both adorable.

37:46.500 --> 37:48.020
And that fucking bad boy body.

37:50.580 --> 37:59.380
So the first shot, we have a shirtless Sandor Mendel and he's just grabbing whatever detritus

37:59.380 --> 38:01.780
he can fit into the ground.

38:01.780 --> 38:04.180
He's not even using a shovel.

38:04.180 --> 38:06.660
He's so excited about this new project.

38:06.660 --> 38:07.780
He's shirtless though, right?

38:08.580 --> 38:10.340
Shirtless and kind of oiled up.

38:10.340 --> 38:11.940
He's shirtless, but he's like digging.

38:11.940 --> 38:13.460
He's been digging in the ground.

38:13.460 --> 38:14.820
You know what I mean?

38:14.820 --> 38:16.420
It's a hard one shirtless.

38:16.420 --> 38:19.380
And we're talking primo daddy, yeah?

38:19.380 --> 38:20.260
Oh yeah.

38:20.260 --> 38:21.380
Yeah, yeah.

38:21.380 --> 38:24.260
I'm thinking the forums are gonna light up over this one.

38:24.260 --> 38:26.420
Yeah, they're gonna love it.

38:26.420 --> 38:30.020
If we're picking a scars guard for this role, we're definitely gonna go

38:30.020 --> 38:32.180
with like an Alexander over Stellan.

38:32.180 --> 38:33.940
If you know what I'm saying, Daniel.

38:33.940 --> 38:34.260
Got it.

38:34.900 --> 38:37.060
Yeah, a slice of man pie.

38:38.260 --> 38:43.540
And the final episode of the first season is he plants his own dick.

38:43.540 --> 38:46.820
And what happens is he's like, well, other things grow, please.

38:47.700 --> 38:48.980
Please just this once.

38:48.980 --> 38:50.580
And then that one comes out.

38:50.580 --> 38:53.460
And then we, the three show runners get on Twitter like,

38:53.460 --> 38:55.220
and that's why we called it that.

38:55.220 --> 38:56.660
Now shut the fuck up.

38:57.380 --> 38:58.660
We had a plan the whole time.

38:58.660 --> 39:01.940
You guys gotta trust me for once.

39:01.940 --> 39:03.780
We have seven seasons of this shit.

39:06.100 --> 39:10.260
The only problem is we've gotten ahead of the guy writing the dick novels.

39:12.420 --> 39:16.980
By season two, we are completely in undiscovered country at this point.

39:16.980 --> 39:18.820
It is completely playing by our own rules.

39:18.820 --> 39:20.420
But you know why I actually kind of like that, Justin?

39:20.420 --> 39:22.500
Cause the problem was everything we did in season one,

39:22.500 --> 39:23.620
people would sit there and go like,

39:23.620 --> 39:25.220
I can tell you exactly what's gonna happen.

39:25.220 --> 39:29.540
Or like that was different than it was in like the third chapter of the eighth book.

39:29.540 --> 39:33.220
And it's like, okay, we're just, we're making a separate art piece.

39:33.220 --> 39:36.260
I know that it's based on a thing, but this is a different entity.

39:38.260 --> 39:40.820
We should have gone to the money zone about 10 minutes ago.

39:40.820 --> 39:43.860
Our timing is a bit off this time, gang.

39:43.860 --> 39:44.500
That's all right.

39:44.500 --> 39:46.100
Griffin, take us there.

39:46.100 --> 39:55.540
Okay, let me throw the lever.

39:58.580 --> 39:59.060
Are we there?

39:59.620 --> 40:00.180
Yeah, we're here.

40:01.380 --> 40:01.860
How is it?

40:02.820 --> 40:03.700
Not good so far.

40:03.700 --> 40:05.540
It's kind of a slow introduction.

40:05.540 --> 40:08.580
My brother, my brother and me is supported in part by Casper.

40:08.580 --> 40:10.100
We've talked about Casper before.

40:10.100 --> 40:11.620
Are you guys aware of Casper?

40:11.620 --> 40:12.500
You know beds?

40:13.460 --> 40:15.780
You know how sometimes mattresses suck?

40:15.780 --> 40:17.460
You know, they're all lumpy.

40:17.460 --> 40:19.300
They got springs in them or whatever.

40:19.300 --> 40:20.980
Most of the time they're not.

40:20.980 --> 40:21.540
Right?

40:21.540 --> 40:22.420
Not from Casper.

40:23.060 --> 40:26.020
I sleep on a Casper mattress every night.

40:26.020 --> 40:28.820
And it's like, let's see, what can I say?

40:28.820 --> 40:30.580
A realistic comparison to people.

40:30.580 --> 40:32.820
It's like sleeping on a giant's dream.

40:34.900 --> 40:35.940
Is that what it's like?

40:35.940 --> 40:37.140
It's exactly like that.

40:37.140 --> 40:39.700
And they've got a risk-free trial and return policy.

40:39.700 --> 40:42.260
You can try sleeping on Casper for 100 days.

40:42.820 --> 40:45.300
And it's delivered to you free in the US and Canada.

40:45.300 --> 40:47.060
And it's got painless returns, which is great.

40:47.060 --> 40:50.820
Because I'm sick of returning things and people making me walk on coals

40:50.820 --> 40:53.940
and stabbing me with needles to return the shirt I got at Target.

40:55.060 --> 40:58.020
And it comes to you in a box and you cut open the plastic

40:58.020 --> 41:02.420
and it unfolds open like a giant version of those little capsules

41:02.420 --> 41:05.700
you used to put in warm water and they would unfold into a space man.

41:05.700 --> 41:07.780
It's like that, but a mattress you can sleep on.

41:07.780 --> 41:09.380
It's every person's dream.

41:09.380 --> 41:12.980
And right now there's a special offer for listeners of My Brother, My Brother and Me.

41:12.980 --> 41:15.700
You can get $50 towards any mattress purchase

41:15.700 --> 41:18.980
if you go to Casper.com slash My Brother

41:18.980 --> 41:22.020
and use the promo code My Brother, all one word.

41:22.020 --> 41:23.780
Terms and conditions apply.

41:23.780 --> 41:28.500
I assume those terms and conditions are like comfy and sleepiness.

41:28.500 --> 41:30.660
Yeah, if you look at the bottom of the paperwork,

41:30.660 --> 41:32.740
it just says comfy sleepiness on it.

41:32.740 --> 41:33.940
So that should be good.

41:34.580 --> 41:35.460
So go check that out.

41:35.460 --> 41:39.860
Casper.com slash My Brother, promo code My Brother, all one word.

41:39.860 --> 41:40.900
What else we got, Griffin?

41:40.900 --> 41:43.300
We got this one for Blue Apron, guys.

41:43.300 --> 41:44.340
Blue Apron!

41:44.340 --> 41:45.860
Blue Apron's the best.

41:45.860 --> 41:46.820
I know of Blue Apron.

41:48.020 --> 41:50.580
We talk about all the time all three of us use Blue Apron.

41:50.580 --> 41:52.020
It literally changed my life.

41:52.020 --> 41:52.980
It taught me how to cook.

41:52.980 --> 41:55.220
I cook a couple times a week now.

41:56.020 --> 41:56.580
Here's the deal.

41:56.580 --> 41:58.580
They send you the ingredients that you need.

41:58.580 --> 42:04.900
Fresh, amazing ingredients to cook however many meals you sign up for in a week.

42:04.900 --> 42:09.300
They have various options based on your dietary habits

42:09.300 --> 42:11.380
and they are incredible.

42:12.100 --> 42:14.100
You can get stuff like ramen noodles.

42:14.100 --> 42:17.140
You can get fresh heirloom tomatoes.

42:17.780 --> 42:18.580
What are some of that?

42:18.580 --> 42:20.660
Oh, here's some of the meals that are available in June.

42:20.660 --> 42:24.100
Got spicy Korean rice cakes with snow peas and pea shoots.

42:24.100 --> 42:28.180
Got sweet chili ponzu catfish and green beans with coconut ginger rice.

42:28.180 --> 42:31.620
Got New England style salmon rolls with roasted potatoes and chives.

42:31.620 --> 42:34.500
We, what I really like about Blue Apron is when we're signed up,

42:34.500 --> 42:35.940
we get three meals every week.

42:36.740 --> 42:38.180
If you're going to be out of town for a week,

42:38.180 --> 42:40.020
you just get online and go to the website and say,

42:40.020 --> 42:41.860
hey, I got to skip next week and they don't send you next week.

42:41.860 --> 42:42.580
It's not a big deal.

42:42.580 --> 42:45.460
I had to do that for E3 last week and I was heartbroken

42:45.460 --> 42:48.340
to not get the delicious meals that were sent to our door.

42:49.460 --> 42:50.980
I was so excited about Blue Apron.

42:50.980 --> 42:53.060
I was sad I was not going to be in town to cook.

42:53.060 --> 42:54.900
That is how balling Blue Apron is.

42:54.900 --> 42:57.700
Anyway, if you go check out this week's menu,

42:57.700 --> 43:00.820
you can get your first two meals free with free shipping

43:00.820 --> 43:03.380
by going to blueapron.com slash my brother.

43:03.380 --> 43:05.620
Again, blueapron.com slash my brother.

43:05.620 --> 43:07.220
I am not being hyperbolic.

43:07.220 --> 43:10.820
This is not fucking corporate shilling.

43:10.820 --> 43:13.940
That shit is amazing and you should do it

43:13.940 --> 43:15.300
and learn to cook and get better at cooking.

43:16.420 --> 43:16.740
Okay.

43:17.300 --> 43:18.180
You sold me.

43:18.180 --> 43:18.660
Sure.

43:18.660 --> 43:21.780
I got to read the tagline, Blue Apron, a better way to cook.

43:21.780 --> 43:22.420
I'm in.

43:22.420 --> 43:23.300
Sign me up.

43:23.300 --> 43:25.300
Justin, do you have a personal message?

43:25.300 --> 43:26.020
Just kidding, Travis.

43:26.020 --> 43:26.980
I already get Blue Apron.

43:26.980 --> 43:27.620
Did you see though?

43:27.620 --> 43:30.020
That's the kind of realistic emotion that I have.

43:30.020 --> 43:31.860
I believed every second of it.

43:31.860 --> 43:32.820
Justin, you had me.

43:33.540 --> 43:36.580
I got a message from Mason and this is for Autry Johnson

43:36.580 --> 43:37.540
and the message reads this.

43:38.740 --> 43:41.300
If the fox jumps where the tigers play,

43:42.580 --> 43:44.340
the fox will break its back.

43:45.460 --> 43:48.580
And this is preferred to air before the third blood moon.

43:48.580 --> 43:50.420
Yeah, dig it, dig it, dig it, dig it.

43:50.420 --> 43:50.660
Yeah.

43:52.020 --> 43:55.220
We made it just barely, I think.

43:55.220 --> 43:57.300
I hope Autry listens to this in time.

43:57.860 --> 44:00.260
I hope Autry is not a couple episodes behind

44:00.260 --> 44:01.380
or else we missed it.

44:01.380 --> 44:06.100
But usually we get an email message to ask us

44:06.820 --> 44:09.220
if a Jumbotron message is too weird to read.

44:09.860 --> 44:11.860
It is a shockingly frequent occurrence.

44:12.420 --> 44:14.020
Did not get a heads up on this one.

44:14.020 --> 44:14.500
Yeah.

44:14.500 --> 44:17.380
So hopefully someone at MaxFunHQ knows something

44:17.380 --> 44:19.780
and we do not know that this is not an activation.

44:19.780 --> 44:25.220
I'm worried that we just like read a coded like dark brotherhood contract

44:25.220 --> 44:26.580
and there's somebody out there.

44:26.580 --> 44:29.060
Well, Autry Johnson heard this and was like,

44:29.060 --> 44:31.380
fox jumps with the tigers play, oh, okay.

44:31.380 --> 44:32.660
Judge Lance Edo it is.

44:34.900 --> 44:38.180
I hope we got the intonation right then.

44:38.180 --> 44:38.820
Yeah.

44:38.820 --> 44:41.380
I hope we didn't accidentally put the hit out on Eto.

44:41.940 --> 44:44.820
Swap a word somewhere and all of a sudden Eto is going down.

44:44.820 --> 44:46.100
Tigers is capitalized.

44:46.100 --> 44:48.100
I don't know if that, does that matter?

44:48.100 --> 44:48.660
Does that matter?

44:50.260 --> 44:56.340
I got a message from JBW4MJB and it reads,

44:56.340 --> 45:01.540
Happy first anniversary of the coolest, hottest video games husboo in the whole world.

45:01.540 --> 45:04.660
Our surprise wedding was the longest con of 2015

45:04.660 --> 45:08.020
and I'm glad we're working to regain the trust of our loved ones in 2016.

45:08.020 --> 45:12.180
My life with you is more awesome than I ever imagined life could be

45:12.660 --> 45:14.900
and I love you with all of my heart.

45:15.780 --> 45:17.140
And that is so sweet.

45:17.140 --> 45:18.820
And you know what the sweetest part about this is?

45:18.820 --> 45:19.300
What's that?

45:19.300 --> 45:22.180
We got it in the exact right window.

45:22.180 --> 45:22.980
So there.

45:22.980 --> 45:28.500
So there. My bet there is that's because JBW bought this six months in advance

45:28.500 --> 45:30.660
as we have instructed all folks to do.

45:31.860 --> 45:35.380
I still, every so often coming through those old emails,

45:35.380 --> 45:38.980
get a, hey, today is my brother's birthday.

45:38.980 --> 45:40.420
Can you say something?

45:40.420 --> 45:42.020
Holler at your boy.

45:43.940 --> 45:47.620
JBWMJB, congratulations on your love,

45:47.620 --> 45:50.100
on your punctuality, on your foresight,

45:50.100 --> 45:53.140
and on your love.

45:53.140 --> 45:57.220
New to Maximum Fun, the Beef and Dairy Network podcast.

45:57.220 --> 45:59.060

45:59.060 --> 46:02.980

46:02.980 --> 46:07.220
All sponsored by Grazex, the latest grass replacement pellet from Mitchell's.

46:07.220 --> 46:09.700

46:13.860 --> 46:16.900
And if it's not clear, this is a comedy podcast.

46:16.900 --> 46:17.460
Beef out.

46:17.460 --> 46:21.860
I ran into a friend in the library today while studying

46:21.860 --> 46:24.100
and mentioned in passing that I was hungry.

46:24.100 --> 46:26.740
He offered me some chips, which I accepted.

46:26.740 --> 46:29.780
Then he pulled a family size bag of potato chips out of his bag,

46:29.780 --> 46:32.260
set it down on my desk and said, here you go.

46:32.260 --> 46:35.540
And then walked, sit at a table at the opposite end of the room from me.

46:36.500 --> 46:37.540
Oh shit.

46:38.180 --> 46:42.420
My question is how much of this bag of chips am I allowed or supposed to eat?

46:42.420 --> 46:44.420
At what point do I return the bag to him?

46:44.420 --> 46:45.700
That's from Delaney.

46:45.700 --> 46:49.380
This is hysterical and I don't think this person got what this person just did to you.

46:53.380 --> 47:00.500
They turned you into a legendary like mythic figure in this library of like,

47:00.500 --> 47:02.900
oh man, Dr. Munch is back.

47:03.940 --> 47:04.500
How was your book?

47:04.500 --> 47:05.300
Yeah, he sat there.

47:05.300 --> 47:07.380
He munched for six hours.

47:07.380 --> 47:08.420
How was the library?

47:08.420 --> 47:09.140
Not good.

47:09.140 --> 47:11.380
I was reading a book and I was getting super into it,

47:11.380 --> 47:16.260
but then Dr. Munch rolled around and you know how hard it is to focus.

47:16.260 --> 47:16.740
Yeah.

47:16.740 --> 47:18.180
When Munch comes to town.

47:18.180 --> 47:23.940
When Munch comes to town, starts just chowing down on his KC Masterpiece flavored Lays.

47:25.540 --> 47:27.540
And just bemoaning as he walks around.

47:27.540 --> 47:30.260
I don't even like the KC Masterpiece Lays.

47:30.260 --> 47:31.940
Where oh where is my friend?

47:31.940 --> 47:33.940
Has anyone seen my friend?

47:35.940 --> 47:37.780
He left me with this burden.

47:38.740 --> 47:39.780
That would be weird.

47:39.780 --> 47:41.940
That's weird.

47:41.940 --> 47:46.580
It's weird also that you were hungry and your friend was like,

47:47.140 --> 47:48.500
do you want some chips?

47:48.500 --> 47:51.780
And your friend had no obvious chips.

47:51.780 --> 47:53.300
No extant chips.

47:53.300 --> 47:55.060
And you're like, yeah, yeah.

47:57.060 --> 48:00.820
You're saying this question asker should have been like, you don't have any chips.

48:03.700 --> 48:04.900
I see no chips.

48:06.260 --> 48:08.020
Is this some kind of goof?

48:08.020 --> 48:10.420
This is what, oh fuck this rules.

48:10.420 --> 48:11.940
This is like the best prank.

48:11.940 --> 48:13.780
This is the best question we've maybe ever gotten.

48:13.780 --> 48:14.420
Here's why.

48:14.420 --> 48:16.020
A, it made me very happy.

48:16.020 --> 48:18.660
B, library is no place for chips.

48:18.660 --> 48:19.140
That's great.

48:19.140 --> 48:20.660
Just the juxtaposition is really-

48:20.660 --> 48:23.540
Crinkly bag, crunchy chip, fat all around.

48:23.540 --> 48:26.020
C, you got a bunch of free chips.

48:26.900 --> 48:27.940
That's excellent.

48:27.940 --> 48:29.300
And that's arguably the best thing.

48:29.300 --> 48:31.060
Like there's some bad stuff that happened too,

48:31.060 --> 48:33.860
but like hang your hat on the fact that you ended this transaction

48:33.860 --> 48:36.900
with a whole bunch of free chips and that's great.

48:36.900 --> 48:38.020
D, it's a very-

48:38.020 --> 48:39.140
Those are the best pranks, by the way.

48:39.140 --> 48:39.380
Yeah.

48:39.380 --> 48:40.900
The pranks where it's like, this was funny,

48:40.900 --> 48:43.460
but I still ended up with something positive out of it.

48:43.460 --> 48:44.580
Right, for sure.

48:44.580 --> 48:46.180
D, oh, that's what I like about punk.

48:46.180 --> 48:48.980
It's like, ah, we got you, but you're not really gonna die.

48:49.540 --> 48:52.180
And you get to hang out with Ashton Kutcher all day, you're welcome.

48:52.180 --> 48:55.220
Yeah, it's kind of like a small scale improv anywhere exercise.

48:55.220 --> 48:59.380
Now D, if this was a prank, it was possibly the greatest prank of all time.

48:59.380 --> 49:03.700
It was the most, it's a very abstract form of embarrassment.

49:03.700 --> 49:07.460
You have a very large bag of chips in a place where those shouldn't be.

49:07.460 --> 49:10.740
Although really, gang, I would challenge anyone to think about a place

49:10.740 --> 49:13.940
where it'd be acceptable to just like go hog

49:13.940 --> 49:17.540
on a big old family-sized bag of Bakelays by yourself.

49:17.540 --> 49:20.820
Like there is no, like what's the place on earth

49:20.820 --> 49:24.260
with like the least amount of like a baseball game?

49:24.260 --> 49:26.500
Still, no, put the big bag away.

49:26.500 --> 49:28.900
There are smaller bags that are made for this occasion.

49:29.700 --> 49:31.540
The way I can prove it's a prank is

49:31.540 --> 49:37.780
is no one puts a family-sized bag of chips into their bag

49:37.780 --> 49:41.860
that was not planning their afternoon around eating those chips.

49:41.860 --> 49:45.620
Like you don't just like just in case bring along

49:45.620 --> 49:48.660
a family-sized bag of KC Masterpiece Lays.

49:48.660 --> 49:50.900
And if you were, you don't hand them off

49:50.900 --> 49:52.900
and then lose contact with them.

49:53.620 --> 49:56.740
You're mama birding that shit to make sure you get back

49:56.740 --> 49:59.380
for your planned a chip feast later on that afternoon.

49:59.380 --> 50:02.260
You have got it on an emotional tether at all times.

50:03.380 --> 50:06.100
Are we all three assuming, sorry, real quick,

50:06.100 --> 50:08.980
are we all three assuming that this bag was unopened

50:08.980 --> 50:10.900
when delivered to said friend?

50:10.900 --> 50:13.940
If not, then I just, I know,

50:14.580 --> 50:15.860
because this question actually seems like

50:16.500 --> 50:19.540
just a really solid sturdy person.

50:19.540 --> 50:21.860
They would have said, put that back in your bag.

50:22.420 --> 50:22.740
Okay.

50:23.540 --> 50:26.740
I don't need, I'm not gonna eat your big open bag of chips.

50:26.740 --> 50:29.700
Thank you, those could be very old.

50:29.700 --> 50:32.500
I have, one of the things about having

50:32.500 --> 50:35.060
an almost two-year-old living in my house now

50:35.060 --> 50:38.500
is that if a package is returned to the cupboard,

50:39.780 --> 50:42.100
then when I extract it from the cupboard

50:42.100 --> 50:43.220
and start enjoying it,

50:43.220 --> 50:45.220
say I'm about to enjoy some goldfish,

50:46.260 --> 50:48.100
a lot of times I'll get an unopened

50:48.900 --> 50:52.180
or I'll get a pre-opened package out of the cupboard

50:52.180 --> 50:53.460
and I'll begin enjoying it

50:53.460 --> 50:56.500
and I'll notice my wife give me kind of like a side eye,

50:56.500 --> 50:59.300
like, oh, that's, oh, okay.

50:59.300 --> 51:00.660
And I'll ask her like, what's up?

51:00.660 --> 51:04.260
And she'll inform me that my daughter had licked

51:04.980 --> 51:07.860
some of them or jammed too many in her mouth

51:08.420 --> 51:10.340
and put them back in the bag.

51:10.340 --> 51:10.740
Cool, cool.

51:10.740 --> 51:13.380
So it's like, to me, in my house,

51:13.380 --> 51:16.580
if I see something opened, it doesn't exist anymore.

51:16.580 --> 51:16.980
Yeah.

51:16.980 --> 51:18.180
I'm just gonna throw it away.

51:18.820 --> 51:22.100
That is marked to be thrown away in the garbage later

51:22.100 --> 51:24.260
because there's no way I'm gonna try to like

51:24.260 --> 51:26.740
like pan for that kind of gold.

51:26.740 --> 51:27.380
No, thank you.

51:28.100 --> 51:30.100
You don't have like an idea of like

51:30.100 --> 51:31.460
how to get the sticky stuff out?

51:32.660 --> 51:33.380
You don't have a-

51:33.380 --> 51:34.420
What do you mean?

51:34.420 --> 51:35.860
You know, you reach in and you touch it

51:35.860 --> 51:37.780
and it's obviously which ones have been baby mouthed

51:37.780 --> 51:39.220
and so you don't eat those ones.

51:39.220 --> 51:39.940
I don't see what the big deal is.

51:39.940 --> 51:41.380
Well, I'll tell you what, Griffin,

51:41.380 --> 51:44.900
when you come to Huntington's-

51:44.900 --> 51:46.500
No, I appreciate the fucking protest.

51:46.500 --> 51:48.180
I'll have you rifle through my fucking snacks

51:48.180 --> 51:51.460
and just plink out the ones that my baby ate.

51:51.460 --> 51:52.180
Well, you don't need me.

51:52.180 --> 51:54.500
You could get like a sandpiper or something.

51:55.220 --> 51:56.180
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

51:56.180 --> 51:57.300
Pour them out in a bowl and you say,

51:57.300 --> 51:58.340
Mr. Sandpiper, go for it.

51:58.340 --> 52:00.020
And that sandpiper will get the good ones out.

52:00.020 --> 52:03.540
Of course, then you'll have to contend with the sand fleas.

52:03.540 --> 52:05.620
Maybe I could dump them all out in a single layer,

52:05.620 --> 52:07.940
turn off all the lights and then spray them with luminol.

52:07.940 --> 52:08.260
Yeah.

52:08.260 --> 52:10.740
And then the ones that reacted to the luminol,

52:10.740 --> 52:12.180
I could safely dispose of.

52:12.180 --> 52:15.780
Not just any luminol, sour cream and chives luminol.

52:16.900 --> 52:18.260
CSI baby touching.

52:18.820 --> 52:20.980
That's kind of like a treat to me at the end, right?

52:20.980 --> 52:23.220
Because it's like, well, I had to spray these all with luminol,

52:23.220 --> 52:25.220
but at least they're zesty.

52:25.220 --> 52:27.460
What if you spread them out and you spray luminol all over them

52:27.460 --> 52:28.660
and then you put a black light over them

52:28.660 --> 52:30.580
and it spells out, Happy Father's Day, Daddy.

52:30.580 --> 52:31.540
I love you so much.

52:32.340 --> 52:33.780
Oh, my God, baby geniuses.

52:33.780 --> 52:36.020
You didn't even think about baby geniuses' craft work.

52:36.020 --> 52:39.220
Do you ever think about whether or not Charlie's a baby genius?

52:39.220 --> 52:40.500
But I'm not saying smart.

52:40.500 --> 52:42.180
I mean, like, can talk.

52:42.180 --> 52:42.740
From the movie.

52:43.380 --> 52:44.660
Can talk when you're not around.

52:45.700 --> 52:46.820
To dogs.

52:46.820 --> 52:47.460
Can dance.

52:47.460 --> 52:48.020
Can break dance.

52:48.020 --> 52:48.420
Can dance.

52:48.420 --> 52:48.980
Can break dance.

52:48.980 --> 52:51.300
Can't steal the Constitution with Nick Cage.

52:51.300 --> 52:53.620
Can understand complex humor and satire.

52:54.420 --> 52:57.540
Does have, oh, sorry, Trav.

52:59.220 --> 53:01.860
If I could just have a moment of your time away from the podcast.

53:03.060 --> 53:07.860
Were you, for a second, implying that in the film Baby Geniuses,

53:07.860 --> 53:10.740
there was, and I believe I'm quoting it directly,

53:10.740 --> 53:13.700
complex humor and satire in the Baby Geniuses films?

53:13.700 --> 53:14.980
Oh, I mean, if you look at it, Justin,

53:14.980 --> 53:17.060
I think it's supposed to be that they made an inverse

53:17.060 --> 53:19.140
in which the babies act more adults

53:19.140 --> 53:20.980
and the adults act more childish

53:20.980 --> 53:23.620
and it's kind of turning our whole society on its ear.

53:25.300 --> 53:27.220
So I think when viewed through that lens,

53:27.220 --> 53:28.980
you will find that the Baby Genius movie,

53:28.980 --> 53:30.900
which admittedly I have not seen,

53:31.540 --> 53:35.140
is a real cutting commentary on the American government.

53:35.940 --> 53:37.860
Okay, Trav, if you could,

53:38.420 --> 53:41.380
maybe you could go through sort of precedent for me

53:41.380 --> 53:45.300
and name some other comedies that were,

53:45.300 --> 53:47.380
that were, you know, real thinkers,

53:47.380 --> 53:49.460
like really challenging material

53:49.460 --> 53:53.060
that featured prominently little people

53:53.060 --> 53:55.860
pretending to be babies with babies heads superimposed over.

53:55.860 --> 53:57.780
I'm gonna say that's Baby's Day Out.

53:58.980 --> 54:01.140
Did not happen in that movie, that was a real baby.

54:02.500 --> 54:03.380
Let's see, what else?

54:04.420 --> 54:05.700
What was that, Rugrats?

54:05.700 --> 54:07.460
The live action Rugrats they made

54:07.460 --> 54:08.980
that was never released in America.

54:09.540 --> 54:13.300
Oh, right, the Japanese Rugrats with live babies.

54:13.300 --> 54:17.140
Yeah, that was little people with babies superimposed over them.

54:18.020 --> 54:20.180
And also-

54:20.180 --> 54:24.260
How did that not scrub the Baby Geniuses project?

54:24.260 --> 54:28.340
When they're in their first pre-pro meeting

54:28.340 --> 54:30.980
and one person's like, I got one way we could do it,

54:30.980 --> 54:32.660
how did someone say like, well,

54:32.660 --> 54:34.660
we have to come up with a better way than that

54:34.660 --> 54:35.860
or we can't make this film?

54:35.860 --> 54:38.660
I'm sorry, Doug, what the fuck did you just say?

54:38.660 --> 54:42.740
We can't make the film because the one way we have to do it

54:42.740 --> 54:44.660
is the absolute pits.

54:44.660 --> 54:46.340
Obviously, in the first focus test,

54:46.340 --> 54:48.100
somebody was just like, I just hate this.

54:48.660 --> 54:50.740
Ah, man, I just really hate looking at this.

54:51.380 --> 54:53.700
I saw the concept art and I hated that

54:53.700 --> 54:56.260
and then I saw some of the stills and I hated that the most

54:56.260 --> 55:00.260
and you've got two whole hours on celluloid for this.

55:01.620 --> 55:03.700
Excuse me, producers, how did this get made?

55:03.700 --> 55:07.140
Well, we shot 90% of it except for that

55:07.140 --> 55:10.340
and we kept thinking we'd come up with a better answer

55:10.340 --> 55:13.140
other than superimposing baby heads

55:13.140 --> 55:15.060
onto adult little people's bodies

55:16.100 --> 55:20.020
and we didn't and then we were kind of pot committed.

55:22.340 --> 55:25.540
I have a question that will consume the rest of your days

55:25.540 --> 55:27.780
and the rest of the days of the listeners of the show.

55:27.780 --> 55:29.940
So if you would like to not listen to this question,

55:29.940 --> 55:31.380
just skip ahead 30 seconds.

55:31.380 --> 55:34.580
But if you're a little person performer

55:35.140 --> 55:38.900
and you are performing as one of the baby geniuses

55:38.900 --> 55:42.660
and you know that your face will be superimposed

55:43.220 --> 55:44.660
over with a baby's face,

55:45.540 --> 55:51.540
what do you do with your face while you are performing?

55:51.540 --> 55:57.940
There are several different options.

55:57.940 --> 56:00.740
Each one is worse than the one before it.

56:00.740 --> 56:04.420
It is a Russian nesting doll of just like existential horror

56:04.420 --> 56:06.900
of like, what do you do with your face

56:06.900 --> 56:10.020
while you are performing as the baby body?

56:10.020 --> 56:14.260
There had to be one actor who like committed face

56:14.260 --> 56:15.940
to match what they were doing

56:15.940 --> 56:19.060
as though it would not be superimposed with a baby face

56:19.060 --> 56:20.420
while all the actors were like,

56:20.420 --> 56:21.700
can you fucking believe Doug?

56:22.340 --> 56:23.780
Can you believe Doug?

56:23.780 --> 56:25.780
He's doing baby faces.

56:25.780 --> 56:27.380
Like what the fuck, Doug?

56:27.380 --> 56:30.260
By the way, I wanna make it 100% clear.

56:30.260 --> 56:33.780
I lay no blame at the fault of the little people

56:33.780 --> 56:36.340
that perform in this film as the babies.

56:36.340 --> 56:38.660
You get that money and you make Hollywood pay

56:38.660 --> 56:40.340
for what they've done to you for generations.

56:40.340 --> 56:41.940
I'm with you on that.

56:41.940 --> 56:43.220
I stand in unity.

56:43.220 --> 56:45.220
I'm just curious, what did you do with your face

56:45.860 --> 56:47.300
the whole time?

56:47.300 --> 56:49.780
Because there's like blank, is that good?

56:51.780 --> 56:54.260
It's just like complete deadpan,

56:54.260 --> 56:56.340
just like Buster Keaton stone face.

56:57.060 --> 56:58.340
Like, could you smile?

56:58.340 --> 56:58.660
Why?

57:00.180 --> 57:00.980
Why would I?

57:00.980 --> 57:03.780
Exactly, give me a reason to smile ever again

57:03.780 --> 57:06.260
and I'll light up this room with these pearly whites.

57:07.620 --> 57:09.140
So that's gonna do it for us here on,

57:09.140 --> 57:11.140
remember me, we hope you've had a lot of fun

57:12.180 --> 57:13.220
listening to the program.

57:14.020 --> 57:15.860
We sure have had a lot of fun talking to you

57:15.860 --> 57:16.660
for this past hour.

57:17.620 --> 57:18.660
We love you very much.

57:20.020 --> 57:22.500
And thank you as always for listening.

57:22.500 --> 57:23.620
You're a real champ.

57:24.180 --> 57:25.940
I have a fun thing that I'm gonna be doing

57:25.940 --> 57:28.020
that I wanted to make sure everyone knew about.

57:28.020 --> 57:30.340
Coming up this Friday, the 24th,

57:30.340 --> 57:34.100
Geek and Sundry, along with Smart Girls of the Party,

57:34.100 --> 57:39.620
Amy Poehler's project, is doing a 24 hour variety show

57:39.620 --> 57:43.380
live streaming to benefit the muscular dystrophy charity,

57:43.380 --> 57:48.020
MDA, and I'm gonna be performing in the first hour of it

57:48.020 --> 57:49.140
starting at 7 p.m.

57:49.140 --> 57:50.660
And I want everybody to like check that out.

57:50.660 --> 57:52.020
I don't have the-

57:52.020 --> 57:53.300
7 p.m. what time zone?

57:53.860 --> 57:56.100
Oh, 7 p.m. Pacific time, Friday night.

57:57.140 --> 57:58.660
I don't have the URL yet,

57:58.660 --> 58:00.500
but I will be tweeting it and pushing it

58:00.500 --> 58:02.260
and I want everybody to come check that out.

58:03.860 --> 58:04.660
So do that.

58:04.660 --> 58:05.460
It's gonna be fun.

58:05.460 --> 58:09.220
Um, I want to thank Sean Roderick

58:09.220 --> 58:10.660
and the Long Winters for using our theme song.

58:10.660 --> 58:12.820
It's a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

58:12.820 --> 58:14.500
It's a wonderful album you should go listen to.

58:14.500 --> 58:16.100
And hey, go to MaximumFun.org

58:16.100 --> 58:17.780

58:20.900 --> 58:22.660

58:43.300 --> 58:45.300
and we are working on a new poster for that

58:45.300 --> 58:47.780
that is gonna just blow all of you away.

58:47.780 --> 58:50.500
It's gonna knock your socks so far off.

58:50.500 --> 58:51.060
Yeah, really excited.

58:51.060 --> 58:52.580
You won't ever find them again.

58:52.580 --> 58:53.780
Uh, is that it?

58:53.780 --> 58:54.500
Anything else?

58:54.500 --> 58:56.820
Uh, real quick, because we haven't recorded again

58:56.820 --> 58:57.860
since it happened.

58:57.860 --> 58:59.860
Uh, I wanna say a big congratulations

58:59.860 --> 59:02.020
to our friend Lin-Manuel Miranda

59:02.020 --> 59:04.420
for his, uh, multiple Tony wins.

59:04.420 --> 59:06.980
Uh, congratulations, Lin.

59:06.980 --> 59:07.780
Many Tonys.

59:07.780 --> 59:10.100
Hey, look, I look forward to holding that Tony

59:10.100 --> 59:12.900
and seeing how fast I can make the little medallion spin

59:12.900 --> 59:14.340
a dream come true.

59:14.340 --> 59:16.100
I look forward to snapping that out

59:16.100 --> 59:17.540
when you're not looking, Lin,

59:17.540 --> 59:18.820
and then taking it home

59:18.820 --> 59:21.220
for the world's most radical Pog Slammer.

59:21.220 --> 59:25.060
Pog Slammer, the world's most radical

59:25.060 --> 59:27.380
and the world's most prestigious

59:27.380 --> 59:28.820
Tony Boney Pog Slammer.

59:32.740 --> 59:34.260
They call him Tony Boney

59:34.260 --> 59:35.940
and he's the best slammer around.

59:37.300 --> 59:38.740
Who you got on your Pogs today, Alf?

59:38.740 --> 59:39.380
Huh, that's neat.

59:41.460 --> 59:42.980
They're mine now, idiot.

59:43.700 --> 59:44.900
Should've known better.

59:44.900 --> 59:46.100
This thing's heavy as fuck.

59:47.940 --> 59:49.460
And prestigious as shit.

59:49.460 --> 59:51.380
It's super prestigious, but more importantly,

59:52.020 --> 59:53.460
it slams like a motherfucker.

59:55.700 --> 59:57.540
Lin, right now, is looking at his Tonys.

59:57.540 --> 59:58.500
He does have more than one.

01:00:02.340 --> 01:00:03.620
I could spare one.

01:00:03.620 --> 01:00:04.500
I could spare one.

01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:05.940
Oh, I'll break one of these bad boys down.

01:00:05.940 --> 01:00:06.740
This is a Yahoo!

01:00:06.740 --> 01:00:07.300
