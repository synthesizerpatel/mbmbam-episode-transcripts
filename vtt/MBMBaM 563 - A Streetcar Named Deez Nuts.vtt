00:00.000 --> 00:04.820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

00:05.760 --> 00:10.580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

00:11.480 --> 00:17.660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

00:17.660 --> 00:30.660
What's up, you cool, baby?

00:47.660 --> 00:49.660
It's better it's better with you

01:08.980 --> 01:10.100
You

01:10.100 --> 01:17.020
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother my brother and me and if I show for the Roger, I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy

01:17.020 --> 01:20.340
Well me, I'm your middle-aged brother Travis big dog woof woof

01:20.980 --> 01:26.260
McElroy and I'm your sweet baby brother Griffin McElroy and I got big news for you

01:26.260 --> 01:31.720
Just came in through the local channels that the pools and the splash pads are back open

01:31.720 --> 01:34.760
And this is a citywide alert and for Austin, Texas

01:34.760 --> 01:39.820
But I imagine also around the world people are celebrating as these big beautiful water

01:40.620 --> 01:45.840
Bodies are ready for business for you. It's a splash pad splash pads like a pool, but it doesn't

01:45.840 --> 01:49.880
Go deep you splashed it very very very shallow pool

01:49.880 --> 01:53.700
But the big pool is what I'm concerned about because I am known

01:54.760 --> 01:56.760
at my local pools

01:57.120 --> 01:58.680
for

01:58.680 --> 02:02.240
When I walk up on it when I walk up on the diving board

02:02.920 --> 02:05.720
in my Oakley's and

02:07.120 --> 02:13.420
That one little strip of sunscreen on my nose. Oh, yeah. Yeah, and and my

02:13.420 --> 02:14.980
surf

02:14.980 --> 02:21.500
shorts, uh-huh, and I do my flex and every the glisten of my body

02:22.500 --> 02:26.460
Catches the light in just the right way and everybody looks at me and they're like, oh no here he comes

02:26.460 --> 02:30.060
And then I do my you know, my big jump off of it and splash down

02:30.060 --> 02:36.940
I people who know me and last year just from the splash from the splash in the pose and the

02:37.500 --> 02:41.940
Shorts and now the whole thing and the strip of sunscreen last year though

02:41.940 --> 02:43.220
Yeah

02:43.220 --> 02:45.540
It's fucking disease. Yeah

02:46.620 --> 02:48.620
Finally we're talking about it

02:48.620 --> 02:54.080
And this disease sucks shit on so many different levels, but the disease kept me from getting mine last year

02:54.180 --> 02:59.040
Yeah, I didn't get a chance to go to my local pool and do my favorite thing

02:59.060 --> 03:03.100
Which is panic as my child is eating a popsicle too slowly

03:03.100 --> 03:07.260
And I know it's gonna fall off as a stick and I know she's gonna be upset about it

03:07.260 --> 03:12.020
And I'm standing there in my rash guard, but I'm not surfing. I'm just covering myself

03:12.020 --> 03:18.180
Cuz I'm afraid of both the Sun and other people's gaze. Yes, so I'm sitting there like, you know, you need to eat it

03:18.180 --> 03:20.380
No, it's it's drip. It's dripping. It is drip

03:20.380 --> 03:25.420
You have to it's gonna fall. Yes, and I'm worried about it. She's not because she has no sense of consequences

03:25.420 --> 03:30.920
Yes, right legalize marijuana strike all marijuana based crimes from the record

03:31.420 --> 03:33.420
expunge them but

03:33.420 --> 03:39.700
Popsicles you have to be 18 because not 18. You don't fucking understand

03:40.500 --> 03:47.320
What the what is expected of you and the pressure and also the consequences though if you do go slow and you do get

03:48.900 --> 03:53.660
I'll take it to go. I'll be eating it in the worst way imaginable. Whatever the you know

03:53.660 --> 03:59.120
The move I love is like I've had four licks off this. I'm gonna set it somewhere. Yeah, I don't remember

03:59.120 --> 04:04.160
Yeah, I set it down three. What do I care? Um, but now

04:04.640 --> 04:08.160
Yeah, I got this fucking text. That's like pool time, baby

04:08.160 --> 04:14.400
And that the text texted you that well the text went out and said hey everybody, especially Griffin

04:14.400 --> 04:18.360
The pools are open again. So everybody detects the pools the mayor

04:19.200 --> 04:20.880
and so

04:20.880 --> 04:27.440
Mayor Austin Austin mayor Austin Austin Steve Austin of Austin is telling me that it's time to come get my splash on and he said

04:27.440 --> 04:29.360
That I could be first in line

04:29.360 --> 04:34.680
There and it was gonna be sort of a ribbon-cutting ceremony and I'm gonna jump through the ribbon in midair. But anyway, I

04:36.080 --> 04:38.600
The pressure is huge now

04:39.320 --> 04:47.160
Because I had a year to think about I had two years to think about how I was gonna make a splash. Yeah

04:47.920 --> 04:51.760
Literally, hey, hey Griffin Griffin. Yeah. Yeah

04:52.520 --> 04:55.960
Yeah, only mask you're gonna be wearing is a snorkel

04:55.960 --> 05:00.840
No, you don't need that when you're doing a diving board splash. Oh, you don't

05:01.480 --> 05:03.480
Here's they've seen me do

05:04.440 --> 05:08.160
Cannonball, they've seen me do double cannonball. Mm-hmm

05:08.680 --> 05:10.680
That's where me and a friend do it at the same time

05:10.920 --> 05:14.840
And we got yelled at by the lifeguard so we can't do the double cannonball again

05:14.840 --> 05:18.680
Cuz they said they'd kick me out of the pool. They don't care how cool I am when I do it jackknife

05:19.000 --> 05:20.240
Yeah

05:20.240 --> 05:26.760
Spread spread it spread it out. I did a I did a phone I've done all the big ones

05:26.760 --> 05:28.800
and I guess I just like

05:29.560 --> 05:33.080
I'm a little worried that I'm gonna come up short this year. Have you done the enema?

05:34.000 --> 05:37.240
That's the one where you get your though you get it to go up

05:37.520 --> 05:42.640
Yeah, where you land like the first part of your body that makes contact with the water is your butthole

05:42.760 --> 05:48.800
Yeah, and it looks like even the cheeks touch. It looks like a cannonball. So you have to announce loudly like it's about to go

05:48.800 --> 05:50.800
Oh, it's about to go up

05:51.120 --> 05:53.280
It's gonna look like a cannonball, but it's gonna go up

05:53.920 --> 05:54.920
and

05:54.920 --> 05:59.360
It's about how you then come out of the water like what sounds you make what face you make? Yeah

05:59.960 --> 06:01.960
Yeah, like ah

06:02.120 --> 06:09.440
Enema, I don't I I don't know more like enemy I cuz people are waiting. Also, this is gonna be

06:10.120 --> 06:17.760
Them knowing that it's all over like the code like coven we're we did we did it and now it's time for us to

06:17.760 --> 06:23.680
Do our this is our mission accomplished banner. Yeah, exactly. I think you're gonna have to make up a new one Griffin

06:24.240 --> 06:28.160
Yeah, you're gonna have to like sit down at the drawing board

06:28.260 --> 06:32.180
You're gonna have to design something and call it like, you know operation mission accomplished

06:32.960 --> 06:34.960
And like you're gonna have to do

06:36.160 --> 06:37.460
You know

06:37.460 --> 06:43.400
Operation herd immunity whatever you want to call this dive, right and it has to tell the story

06:44.160 --> 06:46.160
of America's triumph

06:46.160 --> 06:48.160
Okay

06:48.680 --> 06:50.680
Travis is suggesting a narrative

06:50.880 --> 06:56.360
Splash a narrative dive. Yes, that's a good dive that tells a story that we use a tail

06:56.360 --> 06:59.800
Yes, that's good Travis and I'll be honest. It's give me an idea

06:59.800 --> 07:02.320
That's better than my current sort of prevailing idea

07:02.320 --> 07:06.120
Which is that I get on the diving board and I jump up and I just keep going up

07:06.520 --> 07:09.820
Cuz I didn't know like how I was gonna make that one happen

07:09.820 --> 07:17.080
But you've give me idea of when Time magazine said that I was person of the year or whoever was reading the magazine was person

07:17.080 --> 07:19.180
Of the year and they put a little mirror on the cover

07:19.400 --> 07:26.440
Maybe that's it and I get up on the diving board and I hold up a big mirror and I say it's you blind

07:26.600 --> 07:31.600
Everyone no, I say it's you doing the splash. Oh, I like that

07:31.600 --> 07:37.780
Maybe just a mirror suit Griffin just little chunks like a mosaic, but it's like little chunks of mirror all over you

07:37.780 --> 07:42.120
So when they look at you, it is actually their body that they see perfectly

07:42.820 --> 07:47.340
Aligned with your body. That's good. Yeah, that's awesome

07:47.780 --> 07:52.260
What if I lay what if I plank on the side of the pool and I say I'm the diving board

07:52.260 --> 07:57.640
Oh, you're the jump off jump off my body into the what if you sit in the pool with your mouth open say

07:57.640 --> 08:03.280
This is my tiny pool. Yes, and I fill my mouth right you to leap in. That's really good Justin

08:03.280 --> 08:11.040
a team a team of people kind of a flash mob of people and one by one is they jump off

08:11.600 --> 08:16.140
It's it's like the declaration of independence right one word at a time

08:16.800 --> 08:21.040
Okay, and you guys are going boom boom boom boom boom boom, you know, I mean like one after another

08:21.960 --> 08:28.640
Just everybody lined up going and it's like we the people right or maybe it's even every syllable, right?

08:28.640 --> 08:32.480
Yeah, we the people. Is that what you're going with? Yeah. Yes

08:32.480 --> 08:34.280
Okay, good

08:34.280 --> 08:35.160
That could be good

08:35.160 --> 08:40.760
I also thought if I could do get on that little horses back and get him a jump on the diving board that would hurt him

08:40.760 --> 08:46.540
And he would unless it's one of those cool like beach horses, which I don't think they have those in Central, Texas

08:47.040 --> 08:49.040
He would pass away

08:49.520 --> 08:51.520
Get a celebrity diver. Oh

08:53.320 --> 08:55.320
Yeah

08:56.720 --> 08:57.840
Okay

08:57.840 --> 09:03.520
Sure, yeah name another one name another diver who's not Greg Louganis. Oh, I didn't mean to be fair

09:03.520 --> 09:08.120
I did not mean a diver who was a celebrity. I meant a celebrity to dive

09:09.080 --> 09:17.200
For you the thing about Greg Louganis is everyone's gonna be really nervous. He's gonna bonk his head again. Yeah, like he's an exceptional diver

09:18.200 --> 09:24.320
Athlete, but he did famously bonk his head one time and I think people would be like I'm trying to celebrate kovat

09:24.320 --> 09:25.880
But here I am all stressed out that mr

09:25.880 --> 09:32.020
Louganis is gonna bonk his noggin again is Michael Phelps good at getting into the water or is he just good inside of it?

09:33.280 --> 09:36.360
Yeah, the camera cuts away cuts back. He's already in the water

09:37.520 --> 09:43.320
Exactly. He might just kind of flail all around in midair as he just kind of like lowers in and he snorts like a half

09:43.320 --> 09:45.320
quarter water each time

09:49.520 --> 09:53.100
It's okay Michael it's okay you're in you're in it's fine

09:53.100 --> 09:57.460
You can start swimming now. Okay people start showing up to the Olympic Arena

09:57.900 --> 10:02.940
He's already in the water. He got there first. He got there an hour before everybody else

10:03.720 --> 10:09.020
He had them fill the pool around him. Yeah. Oh, that could be good. Where is Griffin?

10:09.020 --> 10:13.840
He's been at the bottom of the pool for an hour holding his breath. He did the splash a long time

10:14.860 --> 10:18.180
I have a quick update. I wanted to mention and

10:18.180 --> 10:25.060
This was shared amongst our staff and now I want to bring it to everyone's attention last week. We had a brief segment a

10:25.740 --> 10:27.360
diverting

10:27.360 --> 10:29.900
segment about Charles entertainment cheese and

10:30.580 --> 10:35.380
I did want to mention just because I did not have the information at the time that since

10:35.980 --> 10:37.500
2012

10:37.500 --> 10:43.180
Charles entertainment cheese has been voiced by Jared Reddick the lead singer of bowling for soup. Oh

10:43.180 --> 10:48.620
Oh, so not only see the voice of the theme song of Phineas and Ferb

10:48.980 --> 10:53.060
He is also the voice of Charles entertainment cheese and has been for you

10:53.060 --> 10:55.860
That's nine years of the authenticity that you heard in those tracks

10:55.860 --> 10:56.140
Yeah

10:56.140 --> 11:03.600
real like real the Phineas the Phineas and Ferb thing Justin just unlocked a fucking puzzle box in my mind that has been

11:03.980 --> 11:05.860
Screwed pretty tight

11:05.860 --> 11:08.940
Since the since the episode since the recording of that episode

11:08.940 --> 11:15.940
I'm so glad that you've just set me free from the prison of my own thoughts. Tell me more. What do you how do you mean?

11:15.940 --> 11:18.940
It just sounded there was something about Charles entertainment cheese the town

11:18.940 --> 11:19.980
It's always so familiar

11:19.980 --> 11:25.220
Yeah, it was and it was because of the Phineas and Ferb music and I know the thing is fucking me out

11:25.500 --> 11:28.040
What is knowing that after the fight is?

11:28.700 --> 11:35.540
After the fact knowing that it's actually weird to me that it's taken them nine years to think. Oh, maybe an album

11:35.540 --> 11:42.060
Hey, they hey bud get on Spotify and then feel like a real doofus. This guy's been cranking out the hits for a long really

We're gonna have time for more skits later

11:55.620 --> 11:58.460
But now we're gonna help you. Yeah, I want to talk about art

11:59.180 --> 12:05.220
Let's you know because sometimes this show can be a little puerile, but sometimes it could be pretty artsy fartsy

12:05.220 --> 12:08.060
And it's time for work of fart

12:09.860 --> 12:13.460
Just so you know, just so you know trap sorry haters. No, I am I am one of them

12:17.420 --> 12:23.660
Okay, I got three and then a bonus one. So okay. Okay. Okay. Here we go. It's a good way of thinking about it

12:23.660 --> 12:26.580
Yeah, okay this great novel

12:33.000 --> 12:37.560
Wait, is it wait? Hold on. Do we do ding-dong stuff too? Yeah

12:38.640 --> 12:44.920
Whoa, that's the you're expanding sort of the whole concept. Yeah, this is a broadening. This is too broad

12:45.160 --> 12:49.200
Yeah, it's getting silly in work of fart. Okay. Give me that again

12:49.800 --> 12:51.800

13:00.320 --> 13:02.320
Hmm

13:02.320 --> 13:04.980
Damn here. I was talking a big game

13:10.360 --> 13:12.360
I'm gonna need more

13:12.640 --> 13:19.540
Well focus on the the musician part is a ball. Thanks trap. Oh fuck. Yeah, I forgot about one of the ten words that you said

13:20.560 --> 13:25.000
That's all I got. I don't have more clues. Are you ready? I'll just tell you what it is. Justin you wanna make a guess

13:27.800 --> 13:30.440
No, we were looking for Moby's dick

13:30.440 --> 13:32.440
Dick

13:32.480 --> 13:37.080
Moby's dick, but it's that was a book about a whale and not a musician but it was the

13:37.960 --> 13:43.480
Musician, this is what he's doing. No, no, I know he's pulling the threads tighter, but you would you wouldn't

13:44.040 --> 13:48.320
Do you there's no way on a million in a million years. We would have gotten that

13:48.320 --> 13:56.680
Oh stop stop if you had said a musical artist who is obsessed with his own

13:57.000 --> 13:59.720
Phallus I might have been able to get there. Yeah

14:01.160 --> 14:03.480
But like I wouldn't look at yeah

14:03.480 --> 14:09.160
I don't look at any other dick in this any other like PP in this world and go that's mine

14:10.000 --> 14:17.520
Okay, are you ready? I guess so. Is this one gonna make sense and be like solvable and be good this series?

14:17.520 --> 14:20.080

We are looking for poor Richards Balman act, but we'll give it to you. Okay. Well, let's agree to disagree. Just say Balmasack

14:41.360 --> 14:43.360

Heathcliff, uh-huh. Not the cat but a character named Heathcliff, correct?

15:17.880 --> 15:24.280
This is classic literature, which is not my which is not my strong suit is

15:24.920 --> 15:26.920

15:27.680 --> 15:34.120
With her is it withering heights with her and shucks. Is it withering shites? It is withering shites

15:34.960 --> 15:36.960
It is withering shites

15:36.960 --> 15:40.480
It is withering shites one for one one

15:41.400 --> 15:46.320
One for one one for three. Wow. Sorry you each have one. Okay. Okay

15:46.960 --> 15:50.240
Okay, so the bonus now. Yeah ready its deed

15:50.240 --> 15:55.200
It's necessary unless it's also gonna be bad like the first one. Well, that's why it's a bonus

15:56.400 --> 15:59.080
Okay, wait a bonus cuz it's not very good

15:59.680 --> 16:01.120
We'll see

16:01.120 --> 16:06.680
Okay, Stella will need to depend on the kindness of strangers if she's allergic to D's

16:06.680 --> 16:33.840
Is it a streetcar named these nuts doing it and it's already going off the rails

16:36.680 --> 16:45.840
That can't be this can't be the episode title

16:53.160 --> 16:56.720
All right, well then it's up to us to something more

16:57.560 --> 16:58.880
more

16:58.880 --> 17:01.440
Powerful Griffin you didn't hear it. I think

17:01.440 --> 17:08.480
I said it first Justin. I heard it. I thought it I knew it

17:24.720 --> 17:27.360
Okay, so are you done yep

17:27.360 --> 17:32.560
Once again Griffin wins by the way two to one. Yeah, we all lost

17:33.040 --> 17:37.920
I work at a bakery that often has items left over at the end of the day

17:38.440 --> 17:40.440
No

17:40.800 --> 17:42.800
Together

17:42.800 --> 17:56.760
At the end of the day my boss lets me take out whatever I want when we close up shop

17:57.360 --> 18:00.160
We also give whatever is left away to a local church

18:00.440 --> 18:06.880
My problem is that the church volunteers all stand there watching me pack up whatever I want, which is admittedly quite a bit

18:06.880 --> 18:14.080
Brothers, what do I do about the very passive judgment? I feel that's from sweets taker in South, Texas

18:15.040 --> 18:19.880
Yeah, they shouldn't be there while you're doing your shouldn't watch you

18:20.000 --> 18:26.160
They shouldn't watch you while you do yours and this may be something you can fix by maybe throughout the day

18:26.880 --> 18:28.880
If you know something's gonna get

18:29.320 --> 18:30.720
you know

18:30.720 --> 18:34.000
back when I was working at GameStop if somebody traded in like ooh, this is a

18:34.000 --> 18:38.760
A fairly mint copy of dark cloud 2 on PlayStation 2. I'm gonna want this

18:39.320 --> 18:44.080
So I might not stock this one on the shelves right away and buy it myself

18:44.160 --> 18:47.360
I've done a lot of things at GameStop that should have got me quite fire

18:47.360 --> 18:52.440
But I'm saying you do the same thing this cheese Danish looks pretty good. Let me just oops

18:52.440 --> 18:54.440
I dropped it under the bottom rack

18:54.760 --> 18:58.480
Where no one can see it and then the church doesn't have to watch you get it

18:58.480 --> 19:02.920
They should you do though Griffin in that plan to run the risk of like your boss being like hey

19:02.920 --> 19:07.080
What's this stack of kolaches doing back here in this cupboard like those are for God?

19:09.080 --> 19:16.320
Your Ross has created a scenario where like you are de-incentivized to move these on our hearts, right?

19:16.320 --> 19:21.240
So someone's like I'll take an almond tart and you're like, I don't know

19:22.560 --> 19:28.000
I've heard about those heard something about those I would leave that behind for me. I mean

19:28.000 --> 19:33.760
I mean also you can just get these church people in there all day anytime somebody comes in

19:33.760 --> 19:38.960
It's like hmm. Let me buy some almond tarts for me and my beautiful wife and then you say, okay

19:38.960 --> 19:41.160
But then the church people are like, oh no

19:42.120 --> 19:44.120
That's too long and tarts

19:44.360 --> 19:52.560
See predator predator does this and I've always felt like if I buy something at predator, I'm stealing food

19:52.560 --> 19:58.720
Right. When are you buying things that pretty much a yeah, I used to trap though. I didn't used to be

19:59.320 --> 20:01.320
bound like some sort of like

20:01.960 --> 20:08.080
Salt-trapped ghosts in Huntington, West Virginia, like I used to travel around throughout this great globe of ours

20:08.080 --> 20:21.120
Yeah, what you're right though, that was a before I'll never see the inside of a fucking Kedoba I

20:22.440 --> 20:24.440
Got a Kedoba here. I don't want to brag

20:27.080 --> 20:31.280
What's stopping you who who's going to Kedoba good question

20:31.280 --> 20:35.800
Bye, you know whose decision is it when it's time to make more batches of things?

20:35.800 --> 20:41.920
Because you would just like 20 minutes before closing up just like all right pop five in it's a bakery

20:41.920 --> 20:46.880
It's a fancy bakery. You're not like nuking them. Like it has to be prepared lovingly by hand. Yeah

20:48.000 --> 20:54.160
Could you do it? Like I made these and I'm gonna why are you asking me? I don't know. It's not in charge

20:54.160 --> 20:57.160
He's not the boss of bakery. He's not the big Baker boy

20:58.200 --> 21:03.520
Well, I am the big Baker boy. That's what everyone calls me in town, but not for this particular

21:03.520 --> 21:05.520
South Texas

21:05.880 --> 21:07.880
just like just

21:08.560 --> 21:15.800
You know what make the church people go first and then if they leave you interesting if they leave you nothing just go

21:15.800 --> 21:22.720
Oh, uh, okay. I um, okay. I guess I'll won't eat any baked sweets tonight

21:26.320 --> 21:30.800
You can also say you're taking them to a rival Church, there you go

21:30.800 --> 21:36.840
Oh, this is this is for a church with even more kids in it who need these and also

21:37.360 --> 21:43.580
They're building the church out of kolaches. And if I don't get on the kolaches, they won't have a roof

21:43.840 --> 21:51.240
It's a kolache based kid Lutheran Church. See ya. I gotta take all of them. Do you remember those? Oh, man

21:51.240 --> 21:57.960
I was thinking maybe some sort of auction where the church and you would each have a certain number of points

21:57.960 --> 22:01.640
Oh, that's good arbitrary points. You could bid on different baked goods

22:01.640 --> 22:05.920
So that would probably extend this a lot longer than you want you want it to go

22:05.920 --> 22:10.680
I was actually just remembering do you remember the auctions that used to have a church? Yeah, it was the weirdest shit

22:10.680 --> 22:12.680
I've told we've talked about

22:12.800 --> 22:15.340
We have to because it's I don't think so

22:15.340 --> 22:19.880
I barely remember it's like on the edge of my memory like if I hadn't remembered this today

22:19.880 --> 22:21.400
I would have permanently forgotten it

22:21.400 --> 22:27.880
Like basically if we haven't talked about it before you were given points awarded points for things like memorizing a Bible verse

22:27.880 --> 22:32.400
So remembering to bring your Bible bringing a friend was a big one was a billion

22:33.560 --> 22:39.960
Juicy one right there. And then at the end of the year, they would have a stage full of prizes

22:40.840 --> 22:46.120
Like it doesn't really get amazing. Yeah, that's why I got my big mouth Billy Bass from

22:46.960 --> 22:51.880
It is a dragon's horde. Yes. I got a baseball mitt. I got a

22:52.680 --> 22:57.160
Tool belt one time but then you and you would see the kids they come in that night

22:57.160 --> 23:01.960
They're standing around like, you know, like I realize I'm like, I'm definitely gonna bid on that. Oh, is that a basketball?

23:01.960 --> 23:07.080
Oh, yeah, I'm gonna give them and then an auctioneer would auction them off

23:08.040 --> 23:10.040
and it's so

23:10.240 --> 23:13.300
Strange and it was a good incentive program

23:14.200 --> 23:16.200
To save souls to save them

23:18.600 --> 23:25.640
That's has nothing to do with this particular question, but it's fun it's fun to talk about some some stuff

23:25.640 --> 23:27.640
I

23:27.880 --> 23:29.480
Don't think they should be there

23:29.480 --> 23:34.000
I think this is up to you to not let them be in there while you take your stuff

23:34.000 --> 23:37.320
I need privacy for my selection process

23:37.920 --> 23:43.580
Yeah, I don't put it all in your cheeks like a beautiful chip. Oh, yeah happens. So while you make eye contact with them

23:44.040 --> 23:46.040
No again

23:46.720 --> 23:50.680
Do y'all want some some wisdom of the crowd? Yes online

23:50.680 --> 23:59.920
This is another is another wiki how joint that Amelia sent in that Travis saw and then made sure that I saw it and it's

23:59.920 --> 24:02.880
It's a choice one because this article is gonna save a lot of lives

24:03.080 --> 24:09.660
This this segment when it does feature wiki how I think it's gonna have the added benefit of being first of all real gut buster

24:10.120 --> 24:15.080
But second of all save your life save someone's life because this one is how to act when near a coyote

24:15.440 --> 24:18.880
That's the title of it. It was last updated April 26 2020

24:18.880 --> 24:20.880
which is great because if there's been

24:21.300 --> 24:29.020
Coyote evolutions coyote developments as long as they didn't happen within the last year like we're with this article is gonna have us covered

24:29.820 --> 24:32.420
And I will just say that in all of the drawings here

24:32.420 --> 24:38.740
The coyotes look very cute and very squat and small and that's not like the coyotes

24:38.740 --> 24:40.740
I've seen and that's all I'm gonna say about that

24:41.100 --> 24:44.540
But let's start let's just get into it and then we'll talk about some of the audience Q&A

24:44.540 --> 24:51.100
Method number one defend yourself at close range by looking at them in the eyes and back away because the coyote is afraid of you

24:51.500 --> 24:58.240
Make yourself big is another thing. No, wait, hold on that first one. I said that the coyotes afraid of me

24:58.800 --> 25:04.940
Yeah, coyotes are generally frightened of people and will not confront you. I don't know that I trust that that might be true

25:05.260 --> 25:09.860
But with my luck I get that coyote is like I've seen some shit. I'm not afraid of you. Yeah

25:09.860 --> 25:14.440
There's there's yeah coyotes are nasty customers. They will good. They will come at you and that's why in this one

25:14.440 --> 25:20.840
Hold your backpack above your head or your jacket to make yourself seem big or you can shout or yell to frighten the coyote

25:20.840 --> 25:23.920
Or you can throw sticks or rocks to scare away the coyote

25:24.000 --> 25:27.480
So those are things that don't throw anything at the coyote but near it I guess

25:28.760 --> 25:34.100
Actually, damn, I'm looking at this picture the trajectory of this stick might be coyote bound don't throw sticks at coyotes

25:34.100 --> 25:37.360
I'm gonna say that just to point my flag stick for the coyote to chase

25:37.360 --> 25:42.160
Like I'm kind of puppy dog now this is important and God

25:42.160 --> 25:46.720
I hope nobody got a phone call in the middle of this episode and stopped before these words

25:46.720 --> 25:51.240
I'm saying right now and then was confronted by a pack of coyotes because guess what?

25:51.520 --> 25:55.440
When you're dealing with an entire pack of coyotes, the instructions are

25:56.000 --> 26:00.120
Basically the opposite you do not even give them ample space

26:00.400 --> 26:06.360
Do not stare at any of them or act threatening toward them one right one fucking mad dog

26:06.360 --> 26:10.200
Um, that's why they call it that you mad dog one coyote three coyotes

26:10.920 --> 26:17.640
Look unimpressed. Let's look up at the sky. Do not shake a stick. Do not yell. Just be okay. I being somewhere else

26:17.640 --> 26:22.600
I like that. They give the instruction give them ample space like no fuck

26:24.120 --> 26:27.440
Like I did not think the best way was like I'm gonna crowd

26:27.440 --> 26:32.160
I'm gonna crowd into him like I'm trying to get first in line for the buffet. You know what I mean?

26:32.160 --> 26:36.720
Like I know yeah method number three is staying safe in coyote territory

26:36.720 --> 26:40.440
It has only one step and it says be vigilant with your children and pets

26:40.440 --> 26:44.120
Make sure they don't get too close since they can be drawn toward animals and there's a picture of a dad

26:44.600 --> 26:50.560
Ushering his small blonde child away from the three coyotes that are approaching him. No, no

26:50.560 --> 26:58.000
Yeah, these coyotes aren't for you. These sick-looking dogs aren't fun. Like yeah dog. I know I see them, too

26:58.000 --> 27:04.360
So that's helpful. Remember one coyote scare that coyote three coyotes be scared of those coyotes and don't

27:05.360 --> 27:11.440
That's why you need coyotes only one then, you know, it's time for fun, right?

27:11.440 --> 27:16.720
If the coyotes are all three you lay down and you soil yourself and you hope

27:18.440 --> 27:20.440
With shit or pee

27:20.960 --> 27:22.320
That's the right

27:22.320 --> 27:28.000
Now I did say that's all you need to know the community did swing in here with a lot good Q&A's and a lot of them are

27:28.160 --> 27:29.520
fear-based

27:29.520 --> 27:33.740
That there are coyotes in our yard and they killed all the neighbors chickens. Should I be scared? I

27:34.240 --> 27:39.800
Don't somebody answers that says don't be scared but be wary don't go outside once it's dark and keep food inside so that you won't

27:39.800 --> 27:44.200
Attract unwanted animals. That sounds like scared behavior to me. That sounds like scared behavior

27:44.200 --> 27:49.120
That sounds like the behavior of a scared person. What can I do if I hear young coyotes howling near my home?

27:49.120 --> 27:53.280
Just stay inside, especially if it's nighttime. Make sure your pets are safe as well a

27:53.880 --> 27:58.040
Ship in harbor is safe though. And that's very young

27:58.840 --> 28:03.120
You could get in there and reform them before it's too late. That sounds trainable right there

28:03.120 --> 28:08.360
Yes, they're older like I've seen Fox and the Hound right that's fine. Pretty chill early on

28:09.040 --> 28:11.600
Right now right when that Fox is bigger. I don't want

28:12.960 --> 28:17.560
He goes I mean turns into Robin Hood, but I don't want to get in there sexy

28:17.560 --> 28:21.320
I he's so sexy so sexual when the coyotes are young

28:21.320 --> 28:25.200
I feel like I could get in there and befriend them like oh, here's some meat. Let's hang out

28:25.200 --> 28:27.240
Hey, how's how's your walk with Christ?

28:27.240 --> 28:31.960
You know, I'm in there and I'm talking to them and tell them the good things they could do with their lives and turn it around

28:31.960 --> 28:39.400
I'm standing and delivering them. I'm gonna teach them about math and stuff, but now you guys know about coyotes

28:39.400 --> 28:41.680
So I'm not gonna provide the answers to the next questions

28:41.680 --> 28:44.600
I want to see if you guys can really knock it out of the park. So juice

28:44.600 --> 28:48.280
What do I do if a coyotes outside my front door and I need to go out?

28:48.960 --> 28:50.380
Get a bat

28:50.380 --> 28:56.280
Yeah, that's actually not it says I recommend waiting until the coyote leaves the area if it's an emergency and you must leave your house

28:56.280 --> 29:00.560
Do so with caution and consider bringing a weapon or something to protect yourself. Okay, so not that far off

29:00.560 --> 29:03.900
I'm not that wicked far off. Although again, this is a community answer not from a

29:04.720 --> 29:06.720
respected coyotologist, so

29:08.040 --> 29:12.800
Am I in danger if I hear coyotes near my house in the mornings Travis in the mornings

29:12.800 --> 29:19.360
No, absolutely not. They're sluggish and sleepy. They have not been warmed by the Sun yet. Yes, that's exactly it

29:19.360 --> 29:23.320
They get their power from the Sun just like a Superman does. Yeah, I knew it Justin

29:23.320 --> 29:28.040
I got to get to work and I have to ride my bicycle through an area with high coyote activity

29:28.040 --> 29:34.240
What should I do tie bats to your bicycle like it just married cans? Yeah, that's what it says just here Justin

29:34.240 --> 29:39.060
Great job. What if a pack surrounds your campsite and howls traps? You're gonna howl right back

29:39.060 --> 29:45.500
You remember that pack now my friend welcome your coyote. That's right Travis. It says turn into a coyote with magic from

29:46.280 --> 29:50.320
Some sort of spirit or an amorous that says it right there

29:51.000 --> 29:53.880
Justin this one's great. What should I do if I am scared? Oh

29:55.560 --> 30:00.360
Boy if I had the answer to that one, I'd probably be a little bit of much more chill daily existence. Yeah

30:01.480 --> 30:07.120
Gosh, I don't know. I guess some there's some schools of thought that say like acceptance therapy

30:07.120 --> 30:10.560
It's the way to go you accept these fears. Yes. I have these here. Okay. Sorry, let's Frank

30:10.560 --> 30:18.000
Let's bring this specifically around coyotes if you can. Oh, oh, oh, okay. Sorry. That is your human body giving you smart news

30:20.560 --> 30:26.760
You're bad at coyote and you shouldn't vacate. Yeah, that is your listen to the good news from your human body

30:26.760 --> 30:30.320
Yeah, but juice. Yeah, you're wrong. You have to get to work

30:31.600 --> 30:33.600
I would argue that there are some places

30:33.600 --> 30:38.240
Coyote should be in some places. They shouldn't if I'm out in the forest that I see a coyote

30:38.240 --> 30:39.520
That's his home

30:39.520 --> 30:43.600
But if I'm at my office job working on that big report for mr

30:43.600 --> 30:49.860
Jenkins and I turn around and there's a coyote in my cubicle that coyote should be scared. This is my business

30:49.860 --> 30:54.240
I don't know why this has never bothered me the entirety of recording this program

30:54.240 --> 31:01.240
but as we're doing this segment, I am repeatedly confronted with a vision of someone who

31:01.240 --> 31:05.680
Finds themselves in a coyote situation

31:05.680 --> 31:09.720
Yeah, and is only equipped only knows about this

31:10.960 --> 31:15.760
Information that we have like that is the one tool they've brought with them

31:15.760 --> 31:21.240
There is their personal item is this bit. That's what they brought to Coyote Island in my mind

31:21.240 --> 31:24.840
There's actually a worse scenario where they have listened to this bit

31:24.840 --> 31:28.520
But they also at some point did learn how to actually deal with it

31:28.520 --> 31:32.240
But now they can't remember which one switch exactly

31:33.200 --> 31:35.420
So just to cover them and cover us legally

31:35.680 --> 31:41.440
The answer to what should I do if I am scared as provided by community is you should call your parents or the nearest person

31:41.440 --> 31:47.680
Around or call dial 9-1-1. Whatever you do. Do not run if you run the coyotes will think you're a threat and they will chase you

31:48.240 --> 31:55.120
Getting a lot of conflicting information here, but I do appreciate the first thing I do without the cell hit up dad

31:55.120 --> 32:00.200
It's me. I'm on the Moby. You got me find me find me do find my phone dad. Get here

32:00.200 --> 32:02.200
Ah, the coyote took the phone

32:04.200 --> 32:08.360
It's me Griffin, it's everything's fine here. Did you watch dr. Who?

32:10.800 --> 32:14.240
I just want to cover this last one too cuz I doubt it's gonna be useful but

32:15.160 --> 32:18.360
Will you get attacked by a coyote if you are on a trampoline? Oh

32:19.120 --> 32:21.640
And the answer is if the coyote is on a trampoline

32:21.640 --> 32:26.160
Oh, and the community answer is if the coyotes interested in you

32:26.160 --> 32:28.680
It doesn't matter where you are is safer if you stay inside

32:28.840 --> 32:34.200
But my answer is if you're on a trampoline you will only be attacked by a coyote

32:34.920 --> 32:39.760
Roughly half the time because the other half you're up in the sky coyotes can't jump

32:39.760 --> 32:45.880
And that coyote is gonna have to get on that trampoline with you. I would say you are wicked safe on it

32:45.880 --> 32:51.720
This is one no legal worries legal worries aside Griffin McElroy guarantee

32:52.160 --> 32:56.080
Coyotes coming at you get up on a trampoline. They're gonna have no fucking idea what to do

32:56.080 --> 33:00.920
If they do get up there popcorn bouncing baby, they're gonna know what the fuck to do with that

33:01.440 --> 33:03.440
Hey, do you mind if we take a quick?

40:38.060 --> 40:39.340
I'm

40:39.340 --> 40:43.420
Okay, so I guess the question I would have to ask is like how warm is it outside?

40:43.540 --> 40:45.980
Do I have something to do outside of my house today?

40:45.980 --> 40:52.180

40:52.180 --> 40:58.480
I've been using it so long. I buy a Costco in a billion packs stock. So probably probably so yeah still and then

40:59.140 --> 41:04.740

Yeah, I don't think I might do that rich. It's affordable. It's affordable

45:58.740 --> 46:04.860

46:14.940 --> 46:16.940
secretions menu for a boy

46:17.060 --> 46:20.900
He says smells like this one. It smells like a cheese like a cheese

46:20.900 --> 46:26.380

46:33.900 --> 46:37.220
You need to go right now Richard. You need to go right now Richard. I

46:37.740 --> 46:42.300
Didn't think it would go like that. And I I'm sorry that I stepped out for so I do

46:43.340 --> 46:49.420
And how did you meet this guy and think like at the mall this guy kicks ass and he's funny and I gotta get them

46:49.420 --> 46:54.220
At the mall at the mall he I noticed he wasn't wearing a mask

46:54.220 --> 46:55.980
Everybody else was and I was like that's weird

46:55.980 --> 46:59.580
And he's like I don't I took it off so I could smell some different things

46:59.580 --> 47:03.300
And then I had a bottle of polo club sport in my hand

47:03.300 --> 47:09.940
He smacked it out of my hand and his hands like really big like they're the hands are like really big felt bad

47:09.940 --> 47:14.420
So I think I was just feeling kind of intimidated and I let him be on our podcast and I am sorry about that

47:14.420 --> 47:17.620
I'm sorry about Richard's sink and I'm sorry. I let him be on this

47:17.620 --> 47:20.300
I think the biggest thing for me is that usually when we do have a

47:20.980 --> 47:22.980
Richard stink come on the show

47:23.180 --> 47:29.040
We imprison him in the introduction to the show and I feel like having Richard stink come in, you know

47:29.660 --> 47:31.660
30-some odd minutes in

47:31.740 --> 47:34.420
Really caught a lot of us by surprise in a sense

47:34.420 --> 47:37.700
You could blame the fast-food industry for not coming up with new stuff, huh?

47:37.700 --> 47:42.340
Okay, so the people who are detractors of munch squad need now they know

47:42.340 --> 47:48.180
What is behind the curtain? What is behind what what lies behind this veil of ignorance?

47:48.180 --> 47:52.320
And that is if much squad goes away Richard stink come to play, you know

47:52.820 --> 47:58.900
People like I think this is gonna be a divisive moment. Okay in the in the show's history

47:58.900 --> 48:01.380
Yeah, because I like guests. Yeah

48:02.180 --> 48:07.380
Fresh energy. Yeah to the show and a lot of people don't like can I say you my one regret? I

48:07.380 --> 48:14.980
I didn't ask Richard if stink was his real name and it led him to the smell game

48:15.420 --> 48:16.740
or

48:16.740 --> 48:21.380
was he so into smells that he changed his last thing to stink and

48:21.940 --> 48:26.380
I was knowing his parents were stink up a wits. Oh in 10

48:26.540 --> 48:30.980
How do you know so much about Richard stink Justin? It was a long drive back from the mall

48:30.980 --> 48:33.280
Did you start to take him back there to get his car?

48:33.280 --> 48:39.000
He's giving me a thumbs up like he's fine here, which I'm not crazy about. Oh, boy. Hey

48:40.880 --> 48:47.440
All right, yeah, we're good he's gotten the hint he's leaving but you drove there Justin I did I think he's gonna hitchhike

48:47.680 --> 48:50.960
No, he stole my wife's car. God dang it. Oh shoot

48:52.240 --> 48:55.400
Happens to the best of us. Yes. We hear another question. Yeah

48:56.760 --> 48:58.000
What's wrong?

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
Still thinking about Richard stink, I guess

49:00.000 --> 49:05.620
Well, this is the problem, right? You think at first it's not very good. And then it I guess he kind of gets

49:05.620 --> 49:10.580
I just have a hole in my heart for this is this delightful little little French smell monster

49:11.220 --> 49:13.220
He's not he definitely wasn't French

49:13.740 --> 49:15.900
He's not French. What? Okay

49:17.380 --> 49:21.420
He he seemed to be an amalgamation of several accents

49:21.980 --> 49:25.820
Yeah, yeah, just can I say something actually now that he's out of it? Yeah

49:25.820 --> 49:32.740
Yeah, please don't bring up his walk with Christ cuz it's like get angry at you. Did you try to it's no

49:32.740 --> 49:34.740
I did and it was like half the drive

49:34.740 --> 49:41.140
So like please if Richard sick ever comes back on the show, please don't bring up his walk with Christ. Okay. Thank you. Sure

49:41.940 --> 49:44.740
My mom and I recently attended the wedding of an acquaintance

49:45.320 --> 49:49.340
The wedding was for the son of a family friend. So we're not particularly close to them

49:49.580 --> 49:53.560
We chose to go the easy route on the gift and give them a card with some cash in it

49:53.560 --> 49:58.600
Perfect, but now my mom can't seem to remember if she put the money in the card

49:58.600 --> 50:03.600
Oh shit shit shit. Did we actually just give them a card as a wedding present?

50:03.600 --> 50:09.960
I don't want them to think we're cheapskates. They will our our family already has a bad rep for being late to everything

50:10.440 --> 50:15.720
Yes, we were late to the wedding. I don't want another stigma be spurting our good name

50:16.080 --> 50:21.320
Should we ask them if we put money in the card or should we just send them another card with money just in case?

50:21.320 --> 50:27.400
That's from awful wedding guests in Austin man. That second one. I think would be a big swing and a miss, huh?

50:27.400 --> 50:31.560
It would be it's the worst imaginable answer is to send them another car with money in it

50:31.560 --> 50:34.800
Cuz with a little inscription that's like here's some more I guess

50:35.320 --> 50:39.100
Because more or or any the first of it

50:40.080 --> 50:44.440
Yeah, this this one seems pretty it's embarrassing, but she got to just say like hey

50:44.440 --> 50:48.200
This is embarrassing, but my mom doesn't remember she put money in the card and I was there money in that card

50:48.200 --> 50:51.840
Oh, and then but they might fib to get double money

50:51.840 --> 50:54.400
But then the guilt is on them and not on you

50:54.400 --> 50:58.600
But and they oh, but what if they know what if they're like, I think they're testing me

50:58.600 --> 51:01.760
And if I say no and they know that they did oh

51:02.280 --> 51:05.240
It's gonna be uncomfortable no matter yeah, but the most

51:06.240 --> 51:08.920
Most uncomfortable is you do double card double money. That sucks

51:09.040 --> 51:14.320
next right behind that is you did not give them any money and you just gave them a great card that says like

51:14.320 --> 51:18.600
I enjoy the can't enjoy that. Yeah, I hope you don't spend it all in one place

51:19.480 --> 51:24.880
Can you create a third person? That's neither you nor your mother that you can blame it on

51:25.640 --> 51:28.160
Can you create a some kind of bumbling?

51:29.040 --> 51:33.840
You know a bun berry if you will where you can say like, oh, yeah. No, um our

51:34.480 --> 51:38.460
our butler was supposed to put the money in the card and now

51:38.460 --> 51:44.460
Uh, he can't remember if he did or not. And if he didn't I'm gonna fire him, right?

51:44.900 --> 51:47.700
A real uncle Billy is what you're talking. Yes

51:48.740 --> 51:53.580
It was supposed to go in but now mr. Potter is gonna take over the whole fucking fucking money, Billy

51:57.940 --> 52:03.880
Yeah, you guys just say it this is a tough one but it's it is I don't you can deal with this

52:04.620 --> 52:07.700
That you can deal with. Oh, all right

52:07.700 --> 52:13.040
Not is it not for jokes? Can we really play out that phone call? Sure. Can you be the okay, go ahead

52:14.460 --> 52:18.020

Well, think about did you get we got a lot we had literally does

52:56.260 --> 52:58.260

53:02.660 --> 53:04.660
