00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.000 --> 00:11.000
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.000 --> 00:18.000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
What's up, you cool baby?

00:20.000 --> 00:30.000
If you change your mind, I'm the first in line. Honey, I'm still free, take a chance on me.

00:30.000 --> 00:40.000
If you need me, let me know, I'm gonna be around. If you got no place to go, when you're feeling down.

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
If you're all alone, with a pretty verse, I'm gonna be with you.

00:44.000 --> 00:57.000
Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to me. Happy birthday, dear Travis and Justin. Happy birthday to us.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
So unfair.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
Best day of the year.

01:00.000 --> 01:08.000
Why couldn't they, like, our parents are intelligent people. Why couldn't they have, you know, timed it out so that I would have come out on a...

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
I have to wait another, like, six months for mine.

01:10.000 --> 01:20.000
Today is Travis and Justin's birthday. Justin, that's me. Me and Travis is our birthday. And we're celebrating in style.

01:20.000 --> 01:30.000
I always kind of found it weak that when we were growing up and, you know, Griffin was still a small wee babe, he would get presents on our birthday because he was one of the three that didn't.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
Right, he didn't understand.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
Do you know why that happened?

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
Because you were a baby?

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
I would have cried if I didn't.

01:37.000 --> 01:42.000
Yeah, because he had a baby chromagnum brain. Baby brains and chromagnum brains are basically the same thing.

01:42.000 --> 01:52.000
But it is our birthday. We're celebrating the only way we know how by taking your ignorance of certain topics, turning it alchemy-like into wisdom.

01:52.000 --> 01:58.000
This is my brother, my brother and me. It's an advice show for the modern era.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
Let's just get right into it.

02:00.000 --> 02:08.000
I want to cut through the red tape, cut through all the business, and just really get down into this deep.

02:08.000 --> 02:18.000
So let's start off with an email. It says, I have a cat who is generally a bit standoffish. She doesn't snuggle, doesn't much like being picked up.

02:18.000 --> 02:25.000
The only time she wants to get on my lap is when I'm in the bathroom, tending to secondary biological output.

02:25.000 --> 02:33.000
I have always enjoyed her company as an alternative to reading or staring blankly at a wall. My husband, however, thinks the whole thing is weird,

02:33.000 --> 02:39.000
that I should leave the door shut, ignore her plaintive meows, and get on with my business myself.

02:39.000 --> 02:46.000
She seems so sad when I don't let her in, though. Please give me some guidance here.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
Who's that from?

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
That's from Poop Lap.

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
Sorry, can you slow it down a bit?

02:51.000 --> 02:55.000
It's Poop Lap.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
Yeah.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
Yeah.

02:57.000 --> 03:07.000
I'm trying to imagine what the sad meowing of a cat sounds like when it's behind the door of a bathroom where you are defecating,

03:07.000 --> 03:14.000
and that cat, all it wants is to just come in and just chill with you while you do your business. I'm trying to imagine what that sounds like.

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
I'll tell you, Griffin, it sounds exactly like Purple Rain.

03:17.000 --> 03:25.000
I'm trying to make a concerted effort here to not take this in the scatological territory, so I'm going to talk about the ethics of what's happening here.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
Okay.

03:26.000 --> 03:30.000
In this modern society, in the society in which we live, we are so connected.

03:30.000 --> 03:40.000
You know, every moment you're on the book, you're on the FB, you're on the Google, you're Googling, you're tweeting, Twoto, on all the services.

03:40.000 --> 03:48.000
Form Spring, Tumblin, Tumblin, you're on the Tumblin, you're on the Tamblin, you're on the Crumping, you're Crumping.

03:48.000 --> 03:52.000
It's just so many different outlets for people to stay connected with you.

03:52.000 --> 04:07.000
The B-room is really the one time of the day when you get to just be, that's for nobody else, not for your cat, not for Facebook.

04:07.000 --> 04:16.000
What you're ignoring, though, is that your cat's not on Twitter, your cat's not on Facebook, it's not Tumblin, it's not Smanging.

04:16.000 --> 04:22.000
I am pretty sure no cats are on my Facebook friends.

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
I actually have a couple.

04:25.000 --> 04:29.000
Yeah, I have people who use their cats as their pictures, which, by the way, that's not you.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
Stop lying.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
Get your baby off there, too, while we're at it.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
It's not you.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
Your baby is not you.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
You are you.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
Don't confuse me.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
The pictures of you holding other people's babies, not cool.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
Not cool.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
It's confusing.

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
You're putting your baby on the grid already, just the babies on the grid.

04:44.000 --> 04:48.000
I think that I have to be pretty steadfast in this, Griffin.

04:48.000 --> 04:52.000
I understand what you're saying, but it's about your mental state.

04:52.000 --> 04:57.000
It's not about your cat can't track you on Twitter, so now you're going to let it be in the bathroom with you.

04:57.000 --> 05:01.000
But the thing is, it sounds like it's good for her mental state.

05:01.000 --> 05:07.000
She enjoys the cat's company while she's making business.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
What does it say about the cat's relationship?

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
The only time she likes to be with you.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
Oh, the cat's a fucking freak.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
Don't get me wrong.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
As long as we can all agree on that.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
Okay, the cat's dirty, right?

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
That cat is a dirty ass cat.

05:18.000 --> 05:22.000
That cat is some sort of reincarnated scat pervert.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
Fuck that cat.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
Your cat's a freak.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
Your cat's a pervert.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
Your cat is a pervert.

05:28.000 --> 05:33.000
But, I mean, if you enjoy her company, then more power to you.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
I say, poop away, cat on lap.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
I don't think it's okay.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
Let's take a vote.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
Is it okay?

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
It's not.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
It's not okay.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
Is November 8 the best day of the year?

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
Yes.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
Yes.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
Okay.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
Majority rules.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
It's the best.

05:47.000 --> 05:52.000
I work at the most monotonous job ever, and your podcast brightens my Mondays.

05:52.000 --> 05:57.000
I was wondering if you could recommend any other podcasts or activities to make my work days more exciting.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
Thanks.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
Are we going to recommend any competitors?

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
Get real, StormSpring.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
Nice try.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
Sorry.

06:05.000 --> 06:09.000
Does McDonald's talk about how tasty Whoppers are?

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
Never.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
They probably do.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
Probably.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
Probably in secret at meetings.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
Our burgers are whack.

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
You know who's got those dope burgers?

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
Don't tell anybody.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
BK.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
BK.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
BK and DQ.

06:24.000 --> 06:30.000
Me and all my billionaire buddies, we always like to go to just hit the BK at the late

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
night.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
You've got to get that BK.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
Our chicken select strips are bullshit.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
You get that strip at BK?

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
They got that shit in the shape of a crown.

06:40.000 --> 06:45.000
First off, maybe go get some McDonald's and Burger King.

06:45.000 --> 06:51.000
That's fun food, fun to eat, and that can really help to make the days pass.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
Just eating fast food?

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
Eating fast food.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
Just kill the lonely times.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
Kill the sad times with the taste of salt and fat.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
Oh boy.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
Now I see how I'm hungry.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
Oops.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
You did it again, McDonald's advertisers.

07:04.000 --> 07:08.000
I think whatever recommendations we could give you depends entirely on what your job

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
is.

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
Because if you're a surgeon, you need to fucking look sharp.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
You need to put down the iPod.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
Was that a pun?

07:16.000 --> 07:20.000
It didn't mean it to be, but I'll take it.

07:20.000 --> 07:24.000
You need to not be distracted when you're cutting into humans.

07:24.000 --> 07:30.000
If you, I don't know, scan medical documents into a computer for eight hours a day, then

07:30.000 --> 07:36.000
you're going to need some help, some assistance.

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
My suggestion, a clipboard.

07:39.000 --> 07:43.000
I know it seems, but it'll let you get away with literally anything.

07:43.000 --> 07:48.000
You can put Sudoku on there, you can put some Crossword on there, or just carry it around

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
so no one will speak to you.

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
How did you just pronounce the word Sudoku?

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
I think I said Sinoko.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
Sinoko.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
No, Griffin, you're confused.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
Sinoko is that new joint.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
Hey, have you guys played Sadaka?

08:01.000 --> 08:05.000
Have you played Neil Sadaka?

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
I was actually thinking of the gas station Sinoko.

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
Did you get that new John Sakata record?

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
Wow.

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
And the game included inside the CD notes?

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
Really fun.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
We play it all day.

08:17.000 --> 08:23.000
Sudoku is that new Sudoku where it makes a picture at the end.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
And then the cards bounce around the screen.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
An erotic picture.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
That's a sexy picture.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
Sudoko.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
It kind of looks like a boob made of blocks.

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
We have given this person zero advice.

08:34.000 --> 08:41.000
Okay, we've got to get, I think the best thing to do is to just, you've got to shut your brain

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
off and let it take you to another far away place.

08:44.000 --> 08:51.000
Like if you can't do something obvious like read or ride a moped or something when nobody's there,

08:51.000 --> 08:55.000
you've got to take your mind and let it take you on a journey.

08:55.000 --> 08:59.000
No one is your boss in your head at all.

08:59.000 --> 09:02.000
And another fun game is to play little games with yourself.

09:02.000 --> 09:06.000
Like how many times can I slip this word into a conversation before someone notices?

09:06.000 --> 09:11.000
And how often can I mispronounce words like Sudoku until someone notices?

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
See how long it takes you.

09:12.000 --> 09:17.000
Walk around all day next Monday and walk around saying Sodomcum.

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
And wait until someone corrects me.

09:20.000 --> 09:24.000
Now Travis, I have to ask, do you play that game when you're doing the podcast with us?

09:24.000 --> 09:29.000
Because you did just say Sudoko in a strange manner.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
Of course not, Griffin.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
I'm going to be on the lookout now.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
Let's do a Yahoo answer.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
Yeah, that would be great.

09:36.000 --> 09:39.000
This one was sent in by Art Santana.

09:39.000 --> 09:43.000
That's probably his real name, but wow, that's a good name.

09:43.000 --> 09:48.000
Have you guys noticed how many people with totally fresh names listen to our podcast?

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
Like Max Jackman?

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
Like Max Jackman?

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
It's really flattering.

09:52.000 --> 09:58.000
Anyway, this Yahoo answer is from Thomas Schlicher.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
What?

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
Almost certainly I said that wrong.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
Not a good name.

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
Yeah, that's a bad name, but he doesn't listen to the show, so we're fine.

10:05.000 --> 10:13.000
He asks, how do I tell my mom, dad, friends, et cetera, that I am a furry?

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
I have a huge problem.

10:16.000 --> 10:19.000
I'm 13 and furry.

10:19.000 --> 10:23.000
My girlfriend is also 13 and furry.

10:23.000 --> 10:28.000
But I told my mom about it, and she told me that furry fandom is one of the, quote,

10:28.000 --> 10:32.000
most disgusting and horrific things she has ever heard, end quote.

10:32.000 --> 10:35.000
My dad's reaction was almost the same, but he took it better.

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
Now, though, I don't know what to do.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
Please help.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
What do you think that dad's reaction was like?

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
Hey, son.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
You're what?

10:43.000 --> 10:49.000
This isn't my jam, but I think your mother really went overboard with her reaction to

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
this news.

10:50.000 --> 10:53.000
So yeah, I don't understand what all the hubbub is about.

10:53.000 --> 10:57.000
He's just furry like he's going through puberty and starting to get hair in weird places.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
That's normal.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
That happens to the best of us.

11:00.000 --> 11:06.000
I'm almost certain he means he wants to dress up like a raccoon and bone down.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
Here's what's troubling.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
Wait, what?

11:09.000 --> 11:13.000
Yeah, I'm almost positive that's what the furry means.

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
Wait, not like puberty?

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
No, not like puberty.

11:18.000 --> 11:24.000
I feel like we covered this on last week's show, that animals are fucking sexy, yo.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
They're getting sexier every year.

11:26.000 --> 11:33.000
And he's just trying to capitalize on that movement by dressing himself in furs and pelts.

11:33.000 --> 11:40.000
Yeah, and try to capture that sex wave, you mean, before it passes all of us by?

11:40.000 --> 11:46.000
If I were to give this kid some real advice, which I'm not, because yuck, you just got

11:46.000 --> 11:50.000
to wait it out because pretty soon furries are going to be the new vampires.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
Yeah, right.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
Yeah.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
Is this about a trend for you?

11:54.000 --> 12:01.000
Or hey, by the way, the odds against you being a 13 year old person who likes to dress like

12:01.000 --> 12:07.000
a raccoon and have sex, meeting, falling in love with a person, and then discovering that

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
they too enjoy that sex, it doesn't happen.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
Fucking astronomical.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
Also, marry her.

12:13.000 --> 12:19.000
He met her on a furry website and they hooked up on the fur rooms.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
What?

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
Don't.

12:21.000 --> 12:25.000
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
What?

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
Like forums, but with firms.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
I like it.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
I like it.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
Thank you.

12:31.000 --> 12:34.000
I'm going to start calling on that for a week and a half firms.

12:34.000 --> 12:39.000
Have you guys, whenever I read a question like this that has anything to do with the

12:39.000 --> 12:48.000
furry community, um, I think that I'm an incredibly like open-minded person.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
Like, you know, I, I'm colorblind.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
I'm age blind.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
I'm gender blind.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
Like, I don't know.

12:54.000 --> 12:57.000
My patience wears kind of thin with furries.

12:57.000 --> 13:02.000
Like I, I'm not one to hate on any particular group of people because of whatever sexual

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
stuff they're into.

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
Um, and I'll like defend those people and their right to do that.

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
But I just don't have that for furry.

13:10.000 --> 13:16.000
The thing is what you are seeing right now is like this, the furries, the most valuable

13:16.000 --> 13:24.000
service that furry provides us is they let you see inside the head of like a conservative

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
Republican minister.

13:26.000 --> 13:31.000
And like the way he feels about pretty much everybody outside of his immediate family

13:31.000 --> 13:34.000
is the way you feel about furries.

13:34.000 --> 13:37.000
So like, and Furbies, but mainly furries.

13:37.000 --> 13:42.000
I think this falls under a game I like to play called daddy, how did you meet mommy?

13:42.000 --> 13:46.000
And I think any store that says, you know, I looked across the conference hall and saw

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
the sexiest raccoon I've ever seen.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
I was going to say raccoon too.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
It's all about raccoons.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
Yeah.

13:52.000 --> 13:56.000
I think it's because you don't see raccoons a lot in your day to day, so you don't have

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
a lot of personal connection to them.

13:58.000 --> 14:01.000
But so they're like exotic and sexy, but yeah.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
Let me, let me ask you guys.

14:02.000 --> 14:05.000
I looked across the room and saw the sexiest marmot I've ever seen.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
No, that doesn't work.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.000
Yeah.

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
All right.

14:08.000 --> 14:12.000
So three years after the furry civil rights movement.

14:12.000 --> 14:17.000
I mean, am I going to be like the bigot?

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
Like the back against the wall?

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
Like, I'm sorry.

14:19.000 --> 14:23.000
I don't care how far society has come.

14:23.000 --> 14:26.000
I refuse to recognize the right to furries.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
I will never ever be okay with this.

14:28.000 --> 14:31.000
Zero percent chance of me ever, ever, ever being cool with this.

14:31.000 --> 14:38.000
I would at this point, endorse state mandated castration for all furries.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
How does that taste?

14:40.000 --> 14:41.000
What's up?

14:41.000 --> 14:47.000
I'm raising the stakes on our comedy program to endorse the castration of human beings.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
Okay, let's go.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
Get on it politicians.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
Let's get deeper.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
Let's inception what you just said.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
Okay.

14:53.000 --> 14:58.000
Is that, is that a punitive measure or is that more of a population control?

14:58.000 --> 15:04.000
Like you don't want them passing the furry gene, that aberration onto their, their children.

15:04.000 --> 15:11.000
It is absolutely spokesman Bob Barker is it's absolutely both.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
It works both ways.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
Okay, now let's keep one more level.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
Okay.

15:16.000 --> 15:23.000
If, if two people dressed up as raccoons fuck, what are the odds that they'll give birth to a raccoon?

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
Oh my God.

15:25.000 --> 15:30.000
What, this is the kind of future that I'm protecting you and yours against.

15:30.000 --> 15:37.000
My bigger fear is, is like a half man, half raccoon, the man-coon, if you will.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
That, that's really terrifying.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
And it's, and it's totally possible.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
Ask any scientist.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.000
My wife's a doctor.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
I'll ask her.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
She says yes.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
Look at, look at Steve Buscemi.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
Those big rings around his eyes.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
Had to come somewhere.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
What's up?

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
Man-coon Buscemi.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.000
I, castrated also.

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
Sorry.

15:54.000 --> 15:59.000
That I would, here's the, here's a bigger question.

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
I think you get into problem with logistics.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
What's the most efficient way to do it?

16:04.000 --> 16:22.000
I would suggest that all, all furry costumes would come like legally would have to come with a small patch of general burning cream that when, when you put the costume on, it would just send them away.

16:22.000 --> 16:25.000
Like a, like a hair that got too close to a campfire.

16:25.000 --> 16:28.000
That's what I would, that's what I would like to see happen.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
Final question on this subject.

16:30.000 --> 16:36.000
Do you think furries watch Space Jam and just jerk it so right?

16:36.000 --> 16:40.000
Just get that good clean jerk going.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
Probably.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
Lot of anthropomorphic animals in that one.

16:44.000 --> 16:48.000
Problematically though, there's also a lot of sports, which they are not big on.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
I've heard of.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
You don't know that.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
Unless they're mascots.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
Yeah.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
They like that.

16:53.000 --> 17:00.000
They don't see why the basketball has to keep interrupting the mascot show made just for them.

17:00.000 --> 17:03.000
Boy, you know what else they can't watch?

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
A banana split.

17:05.000 --> 17:08.000
They love that jam.

17:08.000 --> 17:20.000
I saw, I saw a local furry get so sexually crazed that he pushed beeper down to the ground and just got away with him.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
Just got on it.

17:21.000 --> 17:24.000
Which is weird because beeper is not an animal by any...

17:24.000 --> 17:27.000
He's anthropomorphized nightmares.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
Like that's, that's something.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
It's a furry costume.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
Those people don't care.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
They'll F anything.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
They just want something with fur.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
They just want something with fur.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
Don't let them near a shag carpet.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
Yeah.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
They'll just work it.

17:38.000 --> 17:41.000
Watch your back Tom Selleck.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
Hey three of me bros.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.000
I like it.

17:44.000 --> 17:47.000
I work in retail and I'm next in line to be manager.

17:47.000 --> 17:51.000
My boss always complains about hating his job, but he just won't leave.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
How can I get him to quit?

17:52.000 --> 17:53.000
I want him.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
I want a promotion.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
Griffin, you know, it's time for Highlander.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.000
What's up?

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
You gotta.

17:58.000 --> 18:01.000
There can be only one manager of this Denny's.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
What?

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
Don't cut off his head.

18:04.000 --> 18:08.000
Whatever you do, that's going to be more trouble than you want.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
I rule the gap.

18:10.000 --> 18:13.000
It will be pretty cool when lightning strikes you in the gap.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
Yeah.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.000
Filling you with powers.

18:15.000 --> 18:18.000
Filling my last sweater.

18:18.000 --> 18:21.000
Now I make the schedules.

18:21.000 --> 18:24.000
Here we are.

18:24.000 --> 18:33.000
Born to be kings of this gap that I now can run.

18:33.000 --> 18:37.000
You should quit.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
Wait, wait, how could he quit?

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
He just killed his manager.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
Before you kill your manager.

18:43.000 --> 18:47.000
By before, I mean, don't, just don't do that.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
Well, don't do it and quit.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
That's the whole purpose.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
I think you should just quit.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
Wait, why?

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
This retail blows.

18:54.000 --> 18:58.000
It just doesn't sound like it's right for you.

18:58.000 --> 19:02.000
I think we've all worked our fair share of retail jobs and I've had a manager do that.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
I would like to cut their head off.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
Sure.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
Yeah.

19:06.000 --> 19:10.000
I mean, I've only worked one, but I mean, that was a pretty pleasant experience.

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
If you are like a hundred percent sure.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
You got mugged.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
Griffin, you got robbed.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
I did get robbed.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
But that was.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
You got robbed at gunpoint.

19:18.000 --> 19:21.000
That was a growth experience that taught me about myself.

19:21.000 --> 19:24.000
And I'm sure it taught that person a little bit about themselves too.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
Yeah.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
I'm positive.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
Or at least now that they're in jail.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
Now that they're in prison.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.000
Yeah.

19:29.000 --> 19:33.000
Do you know that if there is a quickening after a murder, you cannot be legally tried

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
for it?

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
I did not know that.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
Yeah.

19:36.000 --> 19:39.000
If you are a hundred percent sure there's going to be a quickening after you cut someone's

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
head off with a katana.

19:40.000 --> 19:46.000
I guess that explains why in Highlander the series, I mean, Duncan kills a lot of dudes,

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
right?

19:47.000 --> 19:51.000
But he never has to face any litigatory pressure.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
I would never watch something like that.

19:53.000 --> 19:56.000
I don't know why you would reference that.

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
What?

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
No.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
What?

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
No.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
On USA?

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
It's all good.

20:02.000 --> 20:06.000
It's all fun and games to talk about cutting a manager's head off with a katana, but when

20:06.000 --> 20:11.000
you're talking about actually watching Highlander, I don't know, like the series, it goes a little

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
too far for me, I think.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
FormSpring, let me give you some real advice here.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
Uh-oh.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
I know.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
Here's what you need to do.

20:18.000 --> 20:23.000
The next time your manager doodles something or makes something out of a straw paper, act

20:23.000 --> 20:28.000
like it's the greatest thing you've ever seen and encourage him to become a famous

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
artist.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
That's pretty good.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
I like that.

20:31.000 --> 20:34.000
Tell him that he's too good for retail and he needs to get out.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
Exactly.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
Yeah.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
And then after he quits, be like, I was just kidding.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.000
That's dumb.

20:39.000 --> 20:40.000
Yeah.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
And then be like, I'm the manager now.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
Highlander.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
Like, say that.

20:45.000 --> 20:46.000
Here's another option.

20:46.000 --> 20:51.200
Ask him to come back to the warehouse and look at something for you while there's a bunch

20:51.200 --> 20:52.480
of people in there.

20:52.480 --> 20:56.720
And then just like, as soon as you get back there, shout, no, you can't touch my wiener.

20:56.720 --> 20:57.720
Like that.

20:57.720 --> 21:00.200
Like you can't rub it and touch it.

21:00.200 --> 21:04.000
And then like run out screaming with your pants right under your ankles and people will,

21:04.000 --> 21:06.440
they will call for his head.

21:06.440 --> 21:12.040
And then after they call for his head, cut it off, Quickening Highlander.

21:12.040 --> 21:17.800
I think I know what the theme of this episode is.

21:17.800 --> 21:26.480
A Highlander style Quickening after an empty accusation of sexual misconduct.

21:26.480 --> 21:30.320
There can be only one appropriate response.

21:30.320 --> 21:34.320
I'm a 28 year old dude and my boyfriend is 52.

21:34.320 --> 21:38.700
My friends are all cool with the gay thing, but how do I approach the age gap?

21:38.700 --> 21:41.480
He's a pretty cool guy and not at all a granddad.

21:41.480 --> 21:42.480
Cheers.

21:42.480 --> 21:45.320
And this comes to us from Yes, I Know It's Weird.

21:45.320 --> 21:46.320
Listen.

21:46.320 --> 21:47.320
Okay.

21:47.320 --> 21:48.320
Listen.

21:48.320 --> 21:49.320
Are you listening?

21:49.320 --> 21:50.320
I am.

21:50.320 --> 21:54.080
It kind of sucks that he's not at all a granddad.

21:54.080 --> 21:55.080
I am not.

21:55.080 --> 21:56.080
You can always have more of those originals.

21:56.080 --> 22:01.000
If I was a homosexual, I would totally want a granddad boyfriend.

22:01.000 --> 22:02.320
Yeah, totally.

22:02.320 --> 22:03.320
Think of the benefits.

22:03.320 --> 22:04.320
Many.

22:04.320 --> 22:06.320
Too many to name.

22:06.320 --> 22:12.120
Yeah, there's, there's uh, uh, using denture cream as a lubricant.

22:12.120 --> 22:13.120
That's all I got.

22:13.120 --> 22:14.120
See, I was gonna make-

22:14.120 --> 22:15.120
That's not-

22:15.120 --> 22:17.000
Were you gonna go around that region or-

22:17.000 --> 22:24.120
Around that area involving dentures and the options that that provides.

22:24.120 --> 22:25.120
Whoa.

22:25.120 --> 22:26.120
I was just thinking about that.

22:26.120 --> 22:27.120
Yeah.

22:27.120 --> 22:28.120
Take those dentures out, Papa.

22:28.120 --> 22:29.120
Yuma, yuma.

22:29.120 --> 22:30.120
Yuma, yuma, indeed.

22:30.120 --> 22:36.680
I was just thinking about how awesome it would be to roll up to like a hardcore gay club

22:36.680 --> 22:40.600
with like a dude who looks like Andy Griffith in a sweater vest.

22:40.600 --> 22:44.600
Or a dude that is Andy Griffith.

22:44.600 --> 22:49.960
What's nice is that you can, uh, you get to eat dinner at like 430, which is good.

22:49.960 --> 22:52.280
That's a good- I guess that's gay, bad, or indifferent, right?

22:52.280 --> 22:53.560
Like either way, I mean-

22:53.560 --> 22:56.160
I could date a grandma and still get that treatment.

22:56.160 --> 22:57.520
Oh boy.

22:57.520 --> 22:59.680
What is age gap these days?

22:59.680 --> 23:01.840
We're living to like 130, 140.

23:01.840 --> 23:04.000
That's a good, great point, Travis.

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
Science.

23:05.000 --> 23:08.040
Uh, I mean this, this guy's got 25 years on him though.

23:08.040 --> 23:10.600
I mean that's a, that's a significant chunk of change.

23:10.600 --> 23:11.600
Yeah.

23:11.600 --> 23:12.600
Um, I, uh, 24, but-

23:12.600 --> 23:13.600
You know, who's counting?

23:13.600 --> 23:14.600
Who's counting?

23:14.600 --> 23:15.600
Who could do simple subtraction?

23:15.600 --> 23:16.600
Clearly not me.

23:16.600 --> 23:17.600
Uh, it's not his birthday.

23:17.600 --> 23:18.600
Cut him some slack.

23:18.600 --> 23:28.080
Um, I, I think that if your friends are already cool with the gay thing, you gotta understand

23:28.080 --> 23:35.200
that like, I, I mean, it's not that they're not understanding.

23:35.200 --> 23:41.800
It's that, and you might love this grandpa very much, but you're, it's still like bringing

23:41.800 --> 23:43.240
an old guy around.

23:43.240 --> 23:47.480
Oh, get him a t-shirt that says world's best grandpa, but mark out grandpa and write boy

23:47.480 --> 23:49.520
club.

23:49.520 --> 23:52.520
No, come on.

23:52.520 --> 23:54.000
No, come on.

23:54.000 --> 23:59.280
I was going to go with lover, but, um, come on, let's, let's help this.

23:59.280 --> 24:02.640
Here's, here's the important thing when it comes to an age gap.

24:02.640 --> 24:04.240
It's not the age that's important.

24:04.240 --> 24:05.520
It's the interests.

24:05.520 --> 24:09.760
If you share the same interests, if you're into the same things, if you get along well,

24:09.760 --> 24:11.100
age doesn't matter.

24:11.100 --> 24:15.000
But if you don't connect on that level, like if you want to go out all the time and he

24:15.000 --> 24:18.680
wants to stay home, if you have different interests and you're not interested in the

24:18.680 --> 24:19.680
same thing.

24:19.680 --> 24:24.400
And this applies, you know, for anyone entering in a relationship with an older person or,

24:24.400 --> 24:28.880
you know, in any relationship, if you don't have similar interests, if you don't agree

24:28.880 --> 24:31.480
on things, it's not a good match.

24:31.480 --> 24:36.240
If you do, then who the fuck cares, you know, if you guys agree, if you're happy together,

24:36.240 --> 24:37.240
then yeah.

24:37.240 --> 24:38.880
And they will get your friends.

24:38.880 --> 24:42.880
I think if you continue in this relationship and you continue to bring him around, your

24:42.880 --> 24:44.360
friends will get acclimated.

24:44.360 --> 24:45.360
Like they really will.

24:45.360 --> 24:53.080
I mean, they will adjust to this guy, and maybe it won't seem so weird to them after

24:53.080 --> 24:54.080
a while.

24:54.080 --> 24:55.080
I mean, we're all just people, right?

24:55.080 --> 24:56.080
Underneath the skin.

24:56.080 --> 25:01.320
They'll get along really well with him, especially once he keeps giving them like really old

25:01.320 --> 25:03.920
dry pieces of chewing gum.

25:03.920 --> 25:10.240
No, but on the serious though, if you have similar interests with him and you have similar

25:10.240 --> 25:12.280
interests with your friends, they're gonna get along great.

25:12.280 --> 25:13.280
Yeah.

25:13.280 --> 25:14.280
You just gotta prove it to them.

25:14.280 --> 25:20.360
That being said, be prepared for the fact that you will get that initial like, who is

25:20.360 --> 25:21.480
that guy?

25:21.480 --> 25:23.760
And you just have to be braced for that.

25:23.760 --> 25:28.240
You know, I have a lot of friends that are in relationships with people much older than

25:28.240 --> 25:29.240
them.

25:29.240 --> 25:32.880
And I mean, it's one of those things where you just have to be ready for that initial

25:32.880 --> 25:36.120
like, wow, he's a lot older than you.

25:36.120 --> 25:37.320
I know, but I love him.

25:37.320 --> 25:38.320
Oh my God.

25:38.320 --> 25:40.080
Oh my God.

25:40.080 --> 25:42.640
Have him show up and say he is your granddad.

25:42.640 --> 25:54.600
And then halfway through the night, just like, you two just tongue kiss like crazy.

25:54.600 --> 25:58.240
And then he'll be like, what up fuckers, mind blown.

25:58.240 --> 26:01.040
And I'll be like, wow, you're the coolest guy ever.

26:01.040 --> 26:03.040
And you say, but no, we are seriously in love.

26:03.040 --> 26:04.920
And then he breaks into a great guitar solo.

26:04.920 --> 26:06.680
We're very much in love, really.

26:06.680 --> 26:10.660
And they will be so punked, they will love it.

26:10.660 --> 26:15.760
When you're looking for the best way to acclimate your group of friends to your older boyfriend,

26:15.760 --> 26:20.640
the best thing you can do is pretend he's your grandpa and then and just bone down on

26:20.640 --> 26:21.640
him.

26:21.640 --> 26:22.640
Right.

26:22.640 --> 26:25.360
Tung gets him right in the middle of the night.

26:25.360 --> 26:29.280
I hope our dad, who's three years older than this guy, does not listen to this show.

26:29.280 --> 26:35.720
And I was saying that a 52 year old man is like, pretty much dead, he's like a dead guy.

26:35.720 --> 26:40.560
It's like it's like the crypt keeper following you around.

26:40.560 --> 26:41.560
I need help.

26:41.560 --> 26:43.840
And you've come to the right place.

26:43.840 --> 26:47.160
My friend has a crush on me and has asked me out on numerous dates.

26:47.160 --> 26:52.400
I keep politely saying I'm busy that weekend or I have no money, hoping he'll take a hint.

26:52.400 --> 26:54.120
But he keeps persisting.

26:54.120 --> 26:58.320
Is there a way to let him know there's no way me and him could ever be together without

26:58.320 --> 26:59.880
ruining our friendship?

26:59.880 --> 27:01.840
As friend troubles Gmail.

27:01.840 --> 27:02.840
Yeesh.

27:02.840 --> 27:04.080
Bad news.

27:04.080 --> 27:05.080
Your friendship's ruined.

27:05.080 --> 27:06.160
It's already ruined.

27:06.160 --> 27:08.160
But don't don't worry about it, because that's not on you.

27:08.160 --> 27:09.160
That shit's not on you.

27:09.160 --> 27:10.160
This shit's on him.

27:10.160 --> 27:11.720
He made things weird.

27:11.720 --> 27:13.400
He's the weird one.

27:13.400 --> 27:16.640
He he is attacking your country.

27:16.640 --> 27:17.780
You just got to defend yourself.

27:17.780 --> 27:18.780
That's right.

27:18.780 --> 27:19.780
That's right.

27:19.780 --> 27:20.780
He's the aggressor.

27:20.780 --> 27:24.080
Now straight up, though, cut out this hint bullshit.

27:24.080 --> 27:28.320
And you just need to roll up and roll up a newspaper and smack him right on the tip of

27:28.320 --> 27:29.320
his nose.

27:29.320 --> 27:30.320
Precisely.

27:30.320 --> 27:32.180
No, no joke.

27:32.180 --> 27:34.640
Like you've got to be stern with him and be like, listen, if we're going to keep being

27:34.640 --> 27:38.880
friends, you need to fucking cut this shit out because I'm yeah, the longer this goes

27:38.880 --> 27:42.760
on, the less of a chance you have of salvaging the friendship.

27:42.760 --> 27:47.360
You've got to just really straight up say, listen, I don't want this to be embarrassing

27:47.360 --> 27:50.840
or weird, but it's not going to happen with you and me.

27:50.840 --> 27:53.000
I just don't feel about you that way.

27:53.000 --> 27:54.560
And I really like you.

27:54.560 --> 27:56.920
And I want to keep hanging out with you and being friends.

27:56.920 --> 28:00.260
And who knows, maybe for friends long enough, I'll come around and then just like let it

28:00.260 --> 28:01.260
go at that.

28:01.260 --> 28:02.260
You got it.

28:02.260 --> 28:03.260
You got it.

28:03.260 --> 28:04.260
Trust me.

28:04.260 --> 28:05.260
I will get over it.

28:05.260 --> 28:08.520
I mean, he will get it.

28:08.520 --> 28:12.080
Happy birthday to not me.

28:12.080 --> 28:15.120
It feels like everybody's birthday but Griffin's today, doesn't it?

28:15.120 --> 28:16.440
It's weird.

28:16.440 --> 28:17.440
That's how I feel every day.

28:17.440 --> 28:19.280
You got, you got to give it to him straight.

28:19.280 --> 28:20.280
Don't leave him any hope.

28:20.280 --> 28:24.320
Like seriously, I know it seems cruel, but there's nothing cooler than what you're doing

28:24.320 --> 28:25.320
right now.

28:25.320 --> 28:27.480
I promise.

28:27.480 --> 28:31.400
Because when you say these excuses, what he hears, what the guy's brain, what the male's

28:31.400 --> 28:35.200
brain translates that into is, is nothing.

28:35.200 --> 28:36.200
He doesn't translate at all.

28:36.200 --> 28:38.120
He hears exactly what you're saying.

28:38.120 --> 28:39.120
Yeah.

28:39.120 --> 28:40.120
We don't take hints.

28:40.120 --> 28:41.120
Oh, she doesn't have enough time.

28:41.120 --> 28:42.120
Okay.

28:42.120 --> 28:43.120
Great.

28:43.120 --> 28:44.120
I will wait until she's more free.

28:44.120 --> 28:45.120
She has more free time.

28:45.120 --> 28:46.120
Hey, I have it.

28:46.120 --> 28:47.120
I have a Yahoo answer.

28:47.120 --> 28:48.120
Yeah.

28:48.120 --> 28:51.840
It was sent in by jregal21, which is pretty cool.

28:51.840 --> 28:54.840
God, it's a good one.

28:54.840 --> 28:58.360
It's by Yahoo Answers user omgitzal.

28:58.360 --> 28:59.360
Okay.

28:59.360 --> 29:07.840
All right, and it's one of those answers that's not particularly, or the question itself rather

29:07.840 --> 29:08.840
isn't particularly...

29:08.840 --> 29:12.880
Is it maybe omgitzal?

29:12.880 --> 29:15.000
It might be what it is.

29:15.000 --> 29:16.000
Okay.

29:16.000 --> 29:17.000
I don't want to do this anymore.

29:17.000 --> 29:18.000
Thank you.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.840
You're so much better at translating internet speak than I am.

29:20.840 --> 29:27.160
But it's one of those great questions where the comedy doesn't so much come from the question

29:27.160 --> 29:30.360
itself, rather it comes from the answers.

29:30.360 --> 29:35.880
omgitzal asks, need help with my story title.

29:35.880 --> 29:39.960
Hi, I'm writing a story about a young woman who has three children, and one day she gets

29:39.960 --> 29:42.760
into a horrible accident and the three children die.

29:42.760 --> 29:44.700
Her life changes forever from that moment on.

29:44.700 --> 29:48.720
She ends up falling in love with a man whose brother was driving the car that killed her

29:48.720 --> 29:49.720
kids.

29:49.720 --> 29:51.920
Do you have any ideas for a title?

29:51.920 --> 29:55.160
Thanks, smiley face.

29:55.160 --> 29:56.160
So that's the question.

29:56.160 --> 29:57.160
I would call it Yakety Sax.

29:57.160 --> 30:00.920
Isn't that what Family Matters was about?

30:00.920 --> 30:02.120
Yes.

30:02.120 --> 30:04.440
Family Matters would be an appropriate title for this book.

30:04.440 --> 30:06.240
What about Perfect Strangers?

30:06.240 --> 30:07.240
Perfect Strangers?

30:07.240 --> 30:08.240
Empty House?

30:08.240 --> 30:11.240
All of these.

30:11.240 --> 30:12.240
Indeed.

30:12.240 --> 30:16.840
Three was enough, but now we're back down to zero.

30:16.840 --> 30:22.680
Guys, fucking trust me, there's nothing we can say that's going to be funnier than the

30:22.680 --> 30:25.360
questions that the real internet turned out.

30:25.360 --> 30:26.360
Okay.

30:26.360 --> 30:28.480
They answered your question.

30:28.480 --> 30:41.800
Here's one from Nina, who replies, writing waves, parentheses, emotional waves.

30:41.800 --> 30:46.680
Grace says, the painful reminder, or the reminder, because he reminds her about the kids and

30:46.680 --> 30:51.640
the painful loss, sores my mind.

30:51.640 --> 30:52.640
Fuck you.

30:52.640 --> 30:53.640
It does not say that.

30:53.640 --> 30:54.640
Didn't plagiarize that one.

30:54.640 --> 30:55.640
That one came right from her dump piece.

30:55.640 --> 30:56.640
Right from the noggin.

30:56.640 --> 31:01.000
This is noggin cream that I made just for your problem here.

31:01.000 --> 31:04.520
Sakura Shaughnessy has a bunch of really good ones.

31:04.520 --> 31:05.520
Here we go.

31:05.520 --> 31:06.520
Okay.

31:06.520 --> 31:07.600
Loving the dead.

31:07.600 --> 31:08.600
The day they died.

31:08.600 --> 31:09.600
Okay.

31:09.600 --> 31:10.600
Whispy memories.

31:10.600 --> 31:11.600
Whispy memories.

31:11.600 --> 31:17.240
I'm trying to solidify this memory in my head, but I can't.

31:17.240 --> 31:18.240
It's just ephemeral.

31:18.240 --> 31:19.240
It's right there.

31:19.240 --> 31:20.240
It's wispy.

31:20.240 --> 31:21.240
Coping with the pain.

31:21.240 --> 31:22.240
Coping.

31:22.240 --> 31:23.240
Coping.

31:23.240 --> 31:24.240
Coping with the pain.

31:24.240 --> 31:25.240
I like it.

31:25.240 --> 31:26.240
It flows.

31:26.240 --> 31:28.360
Coping with the pain?

31:28.360 --> 31:29.360
Huh?

31:29.360 --> 31:30.360
What?

31:30.360 --> 31:31.360
Grieving Mom.

31:31.360 --> 31:34.200
That's pretty straightforward, I guess.

31:34.200 --> 31:35.200
Book.

31:35.200 --> 31:36.200
Grief.

31:36.200 --> 31:38.900
Book book.

31:38.900 --> 31:41.140
Grief, tears, and love?

31:41.140 --> 31:42.440
There is a question.

31:42.440 --> 31:52.120
That's like, that's like, that's like, they're best friends, but one of them's a cat.

31:52.120 --> 31:53.120
Linda.

31:53.120 --> 31:54.120
She sits on her lap.

31:54.120 --> 32:00.360
Diane asks, or replies, sorry, fatal crossing, maybe the children are killed crossing the

32:00.360 --> 32:03.080
street or at a crosswalk or at a railroad crossing.

32:03.080 --> 32:06.280
Bitch, don't try to rewrite this book before it's wrote.

32:06.280 --> 32:08.960
This is coming from my heart.

32:08.960 --> 32:12.280
Source my mind, trust me.

32:12.280 --> 32:15.040
Trust on the fact that you're not going to help me in the edits.

32:15.040 --> 32:17.160
This is a titling project only.

32:17.160 --> 32:22.080
I am creative enough to come up with a whole book, but not a title for the book.

32:22.080 --> 32:26.640
Percy Jackson 127, who is a top contributor to Yahoo, we haven't seen one of those in

32:26.640 --> 32:39.840
a while, responds, taming soul, taking flight, burning memories, love with the murderer's

32:39.840 --> 32:40.840
boy.

32:40.840 --> 32:41.840
What?

32:41.840 --> 32:46.320
Love with the murderer's boy.

32:46.320 --> 32:51.160
This guy has a fundamental misunderstanding of what this story is about, not like we do,

32:51.160 --> 32:53.320
he didn't get it.

32:53.320 --> 32:54.720
Here's my title.

32:54.720 --> 32:58.360
A book about a woman who falls in love with the dude that killed her kids.

32:58.360 --> 33:03.800
Let me hit you guys with there can be only none.

33:03.800 --> 33:05.360
We got to have a better title than these people.

33:05.360 --> 33:13.600
I do like writing waves of emotion, emotional waves, emotional waves, source.

33:13.600 --> 33:17.280
There's no source on that one, but I'm going to go ahead and assume it was also her mind.

33:17.280 --> 33:19.320
No, that was her heart.

33:19.320 --> 33:22.000
How about moving out?

33:22.000 --> 33:25.600
Whoa, I like it.

33:25.600 --> 33:26.600
Music man.

33:26.600 --> 33:27.600
What about my hero?

33:27.600 --> 33:38.800
Am I to believe that this story is that she falls in love with the brother of the guy

33:38.800 --> 33:40.480
who accidentally killed her kids?

33:40.480 --> 33:41.480
Yes.

33:41.480 --> 33:42.480
This is not-

33:42.480 --> 33:43.480
Sorry about my brother.

33:43.480 --> 33:48.880
That's not a very good book, it doesn't sound like a very good, like a very interesting

33:48.880 --> 33:49.880
story.

33:49.880 --> 33:55.280
Like it seems like that conversation would kind of be like, isn't that, yeah, oh well.

33:55.280 --> 33:56.280
What can you do?

33:56.280 --> 33:57.280
Right?

33:57.280 --> 33:58.280
Oh, that's a good title.

33:58.280 --> 33:59.280
What can you do?

33:59.280 --> 34:00.280
What can you do?

34:00.280 --> 34:01.280
Oh well.

34:01.280 --> 34:07.960
How about, how about just, uh oh, whoops, whoops.

34:07.960 --> 34:08.960
My bad.

34:08.960 --> 34:13.720
Also, Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants.

34:13.720 --> 34:15.640
I had college class that got on early.

34:15.640 --> 34:20.200
I ended up asking the girl I have a crush on and who I usually talk to during class

34:20.200 --> 34:21.200
out to grab something to eat.

34:21.200 --> 34:24.400
I don't consider her a date, but I wanted to get a sense of where I stand with this

34:24.400 --> 34:25.400
girl.

34:25.400 --> 34:31.320
Overwhelmingly, I kept her laughing and entertained and she kept telling me how funny I was.

34:31.320 --> 34:36.000
I consider myself a handsome gent and I have good manners and there was never any breaks

34:36.000 --> 34:37.600
in conversation or awkward pauses.

34:37.600 --> 34:42.840
My question for you, is keeping being the funny guy enough to give me a viable chance

34:42.840 --> 34:43.840
with this girl?

34:43.840 --> 34:47.560
Clearly, Pagliacci, the sad clown.

34:47.560 --> 34:48.980
I like it.

34:48.980 --> 34:49.980
I like that very much.

34:49.980 --> 34:50.980
That's the dopest.

34:50.980 --> 34:53.840
That is a really dope name.

34:53.840 --> 34:57.440
College, huh?

34:57.440 --> 34:59.640
That's my official, that's my official response to this question.

34:59.640 --> 35:01.120
I'm really weighing this one out.

35:01.120 --> 35:02.960
I'm trying to piece this together.

35:02.960 --> 35:11.460
I think if I was a girl, the number one thing I would look for is to be continually surprised.

35:11.460 --> 35:16.280
So maybe tomorrow you go in all business.

35:16.280 --> 35:18.080
Is that the opposite of funny to you?

35:18.080 --> 35:20.200
I would say like just depressed.

35:20.200 --> 35:21.480
Like really sad.

35:21.480 --> 35:26.160
Oh, you mean like, love me.

35:26.160 --> 35:27.160
Not like that.

35:27.160 --> 35:28.160
Not needy.

35:28.160 --> 35:29.160
Don't do that.

35:29.160 --> 35:30.160
Not needy.

35:30.160 --> 35:33.120
Just like, just like look at her and be like, we're all just walking dead people.

35:33.120 --> 35:34.120
Think about it.

35:34.120 --> 35:35.120
Yeah.

35:35.120 --> 35:36.120
And then like, look at your desk.

35:36.120 --> 35:37.680
Like, and she'll be like, wow, you are multi-layered.

35:37.680 --> 35:40.600
I would like to have some sex with you, please.

35:40.600 --> 35:48.960
And then the next emotion, you could be like really envious of things.

35:48.960 --> 35:49.960
That's an emotion.

35:49.960 --> 35:50.960
I'm not sure.

35:50.960 --> 35:52.800
I saw you talking to that guy in the coffee shop today.

35:52.800 --> 35:55.680
I thought we were, we were exclusive.

35:55.680 --> 35:56.680
It wouldn't even have to be about her.

35:56.680 --> 35:59.280
It could be like, oh, guy's backpack is better than mine.

35:59.280 --> 36:01.660
Want it.

36:01.660 --> 36:05.160
The next day you could be listless.

36:05.160 --> 36:08.520
I just, I think that you need to mix it up.

36:08.520 --> 36:09.800
Go on Live Journal, right?

36:09.800 --> 36:15.240
They have a big list of emotions there whenever you're like, oh, today I'm quixotic.

36:15.240 --> 36:17.240
Today I'm highlandery.

36:17.240 --> 36:18.240
God damn it.

36:18.240 --> 36:19.240
Today I'm quickening.

36:19.240 --> 36:20.240
Being funny, no.

36:20.240 --> 36:21.240
Being funny is not enough.

36:21.240 --> 36:22.240
It's not enough.

36:22.240 --> 36:23.240
Yeah.

36:23.240 --> 36:24.240
What, what do you have to be?

36:24.240 --> 36:33.480
It's, well, it's one of those things where, you know, you always, when it, if you ask

36:33.480 --> 36:37.400
any woman what's the number one thing they look for in a guy, the answer is always a

36:37.400 --> 36:38.400
big penis.

36:38.400 --> 36:39.400
Penis, penis width.

36:39.400 --> 36:42.880
Penis, and penis, and penis width.

36:42.880 --> 36:43.880
Penis diameter.

36:43.880 --> 36:44.880
Yeah.

36:44.880 --> 36:48.760
And there's actually a sliding scale of penis diameter versus sense of humor that I'll have

36:48.760 --> 36:49.760
to show you guys sometime.

36:49.760 --> 36:50.920
Let's just put it this way.

36:50.920 --> 36:52.080
I'm very funny.

36:52.080 --> 36:54.640
That's, that's your, that's your BMI, right?

36:54.640 --> 36:57.800
That's, yeah, that's your BMI, that's what BMI is.

36:57.800 --> 37:03.360
But the problem is with that is like, that is the first thing women look for, but not

37:03.360 --> 37:04.360
the only thing.

37:04.360 --> 37:05.360
It's true.

37:05.360 --> 37:10.160
The first thing women look for, then every guy who writes in and says, I like my friend,

37:10.160 --> 37:12.680
I want to ask her out, would totally be dating that friend.

37:12.680 --> 37:13.680
Sure.

37:13.680 --> 37:14.680
I think there's-

37:14.680 --> 37:17.120
You have to have a sexual edge to the relationship.

37:17.120 --> 37:18.120
I'm sorry.

37:18.120 --> 37:19.120
I'm sorry.

37:19.120 --> 37:27.600
I didn't mean to laugh when you just said sexual edge.

37:27.600 --> 37:32.480
That's a powerful turn of phrase, Travis.

37:32.480 --> 37:36.720
That's like a linguistic challenge you've put up there, I think.

37:36.720 --> 37:41.920
That's actually the name of my erotic sword company.

37:41.920 --> 37:43.160
Why did you even start that?

37:43.160 --> 37:44.160
It's floundering, you know?

37:44.160 --> 37:46.120
Did you hear about Travis' sword company?

37:46.120 --> 37:47.720
It's not doing well.

37:47.720 --> 37:48.720
It's all erotic.

37:48.720 --> 37:55.520
They have a, they have a very nice selection of novelty, uh, of boner katanas, but other

37:55.520 --> 37:56.520
than that.

37:56.520 --> 37:59.840
It's, it's a good, I mean, like his business plan was good.

37:59.840 --> 38:04.520
I don't know why the guys from Shark Tank invested so much in it.

38:04.520 --> 38:07.920
Our clothing line, Horny Highlander, is really not working out.

38:07.920 --> 38:13.080
I'm putting a blockade on any more Highlander references this episode.

38:13.080 --> 38:14.080
Okay, sounds good.

38:14.080 --> 38:16.360
I'm putting an embargo on them.

38:16.360 --> 38:22.480
I think the, uh, being funny, I think it shows confidence, which may be more at the source

38:22.480 --> 38:24.840
of the attraction.

38:24.840 --> 38:30.840
It's, it's, and it makes the girl feel, um, safe, because if you're joking about that,

38:30.840 --> 38:34.640
then, if you're joking about anything, then, you know, you're feeling confident and secure

38:34.640 --> 38:35.640
in the situation.

38:35.640 --> 38:45.040
I think you need to bring, there, there's a fine line between funny and goofy, and I

38:45.040 --> 38:52.640
think once you get to goofy, you're in a weird place where you are just an entertaining thing.

38:52.640 --> 39:00.960
You're not like, you're not showing stability or, pardon the phrase, sexual edge.

39:00.960 --> 39:03.480
That's a great phrase.

39:03.480 --> 39:05.960
Can you be goofy and have a sexual edge?

39:05.960 --> 39:08.560
Can you be like a wacky, sexy clown?

39:08.560 --> 39:12.400
It seems like Gowder's been doing okay for himself all these years.

39:12.400 --> 39:14.160
It just, it depends on her.

39:14.160 --> 39:15.920
Like, what is she looking for?

39:15.920 --> 39:18.160
Like maybe she is looking for a sexy clown.

39:18.160 --> 39:21.520
Hey guys, can I just suggest something here and just like lay it out there?

39:21.520 --> 39:23.280
Maybe this will be revolutionary.

39:23.280 --> 39:26.880
Maybe this will start a huge wave that will sweep across the nation.

39:26.880 --> 39:27.880
Just be yourself.

39:27.880 --> 39:28.880
How about that?

39:28.880 --> 39:33.880
And if she doesn't like it, you are cool enough to listen to My Brother, My Brother, Me and

39:33.880 --> 39:36.240
write in with the name Pagliacci the sad clown.

39:36.240 --> 39:37.980
I think you're pretty cool.

39:37.980 --> 39:43.960
So maybe she should just get, get on with it, get it, get down with it.

39:43.960 --> 39:44.960
I don't mean like sexy.

39:44.960 --> 39:49.000
I mean like get the hint that you are really dope.

39:49.000 --> 39:50.000
You're a really dope guy.

39:50.000 --> 39:53.360
Yeah, just have her listen to this episode of the podcast.

39:53.360 --> 39:58.080
Have her listen to this right now if she doesn't believe how dope you are and, and you know,

39:58.080 --> 40:00.400
I think it'll do a pretty good job of convincing her.

40:00.400 --> 40:03.040
You might want to fast forward back to the part where we cut off a bunch of people's

40:03.040 --> 40:04.040
heads.

40:04.040 --> 40:05.040
Yeah.

40:05.040 --> 40:08.440
And also the parts about fucking raccoons, the part about fucking grandpas.

40:08.440 --> 40:09.440
Sexy grandpas.

40:09.440 --> 40:10.440
Sexy grandpas.

40:10.440 --> 40:11.440
That part.

40:11.440 --> 40:12.440
Pooping.

40:12.440 --> 40:13.440
We talked about pooping with a cat in your lap.

40:13.440 --> 40:14.440
There's-

40:14.440 --> 40:15.440
Don't, not this shit.

40:15.440 --> 40:17.040
Don't play our podcast for her.

40:17.040 --> 40:18.040
I want to-

40:18.040 --> 40:19.040
Not necessarily this one.

40:19.040 --> 40:20.040
Well, any of them.

40:20.040 --> 40:23.680
I just want to rejigger that advice real quick or recalibrate.

40:23.680 --> 40:25.960
Griffin, I'm a professional songwriter.

40:25.960 --> 40:28.840
I don't know if you know, but professional songwriter.

40:28.840 --> 40:31.640
I mean, I play off in empty clubs with my band for free.

40:31.640 --> 40:34.080
I've been having a hard time writing songs lately.

40:34.080 --> 40:35.840
Can you give me ideas for things to write about?

40:35.840 --> 40:39.000
Yours truly, Musically Constipated.

40:39.000 --> 40:40.360
There seems like one right there.

40:40.360 --> 40:47.920
I really, I wish I could, but I've, I can't write songs.

40:47.920 --> 40:51.160
Like I love playing guitar and I love listening to songs.

40:51.160 --> 40:56.760
I've never, I actually, I wrote one song in college, but I swear there's nothing you guys

40:56.760 --> 40:59.480
can say that would make me talk about it on the show.

40:59.480 --> 41:01.300
Don't even like, not joking.

41:01.300 --> 41:04.480
Don't even try to make me talk about it on the show because it was, it was the worst

41:04.480 --> 41:05.480
thing ever.

41:05.480 --> 41:06.480
And it was for a girl.

41:06.480 --> 41:13.640
Uh, it may have had references to Superman and that's all we're going to go into about

41:13.640 --> 41:14.640
it.

41:14.640 --> 41:15.640
Okay.

41:15.640 --> 41:16.640
Go ahead.

41:16.640 --> 41:17.640
Just give us a few chords.

41:17.640 --> 41:18.640
I can't.

41:18.640 --> 41:22.480
Justin, but Justin, I think that you are a more prolific songwriter than I am.

41:22.480 --> 41:23.480
Yeah.

41:23.480 --> 41:26.320
I, I think you got to write about, here's, here's what you do.

41:26.320 --> 41:29.640
You take the, you take out your songwriter's microscope.

41:29.640 --> 41:34.520
If you pull it out all the way back and you look at everything, then it's more of like

41:34.520 --> 41:37.120
a magnifying glass or a telescope.

41:37.120 --> 41:43.960
And you see real, real general things like, like love and the sun, but everybody's written

41:43.960 --> 41:44.960
about those things.

41:44.960 --> 41:48.560
So what you got to do is you got to take that off that microscope and just get really deep

41:48.560 --> 41:53.460
and find the things in your life that you think that no one else does.

41:53.460 --> 41:56.600
And I bet that you're going to find some honest stuff there.

41:56.600 --> 42:00.280
Things that you don't think happened to everybody, just to you.

42:00.280 --> 42:03.020
And those are the things that when people hear them, they really relate to them jerking

42:03.020 --> 42:06.360
off to space jam.

42:06.360 --> 42:12.120
I wasn't going to say that, but yeah, I mean, for example, can I, can I counterpoint that?

42:12.120 --> 42:16.120
Is it possible that maybe all the songs have been written?

42:16.120 --> 42:18.000
I think that's totally possible.

42:18.000 --> 42:20.080
Every idea has been thought.

42:20.080 --> 42:22.400
Every song has been written.

42:22.400 --> 42:25.200
There's no more room for any more music in the world.

42:25.200 --> 42:29.360
You got to find a song that you like and then write the opposite song of it.

42:29.360 --> 42:30.360
Right.

42:30.360 --> 42:31.360
Do you know what I'm saying?

42:31.360 --> 42:34.200
Like take a song like, let me think.

42:34.200 --> 42:35.200
Good Sunsetting.

42:35.200 --> 42:36.200
How about that?

42:36.200 --> 42:38.400
Good Sunsetting and write Bad Moonrise.

42:38.400 --> 42:42.640
Son of a bitch.

42:42.640 --> 42:44.880
What's up?

42:44.880 --> 42:46.600
Who then now?

42:46.600 --> 42:52.480
I think that, I think that the greatest thing you can do musically is not write a song and

42:52.480 --> 42:57.160
then tell people that say, I'm a songwriter, but I'm making a powerful statement by not

42:57.160 --> 42:59.180
writing any new music.

42:59.180 --> 43:01.640
This is my song, Four Minutes of Silence.

43:01.640 --> 43:08.240
Why don't you go the Sigur Ros route and, and write songs in a gibberish language?

43:08.240 --> 43:10.560
I mean, there's, it's still challenging.

43:10.560 --> 43:11.880
You have to write pretty chords.

43:11.880 --> 43:12.940
Is that what you're asking?

43:12.940 --> 43:14.000
Maybe he's not asking about lyrics.

43:14.000 --> 43:16.040
Maybe he's asking, asking about chord progressions.

43:16.040 --> 43:21.280
And if that's the case, E, E diminished, F sharp minor, F sharp minor diminished.

43:21.280 --> 43:22.280
You're welcome.

43:22.280 --> 43:23.280
You're welcome.

43:23.280 --> 43:24.860
It's a recipe for success.

43:24.860 --> 43:26.920
You know, you could set yourself up a project.

43:26.920 --> 43:31.960
John Linnell has a project called State Songs where he just goes to the states and writes

43:31.960 --> 43:32.960
songs about each of them.

43:32.960 --> 43:36.640
You could set yourself up something like that, like do the periodic table of elements or

43:36.640 --> 43:37.640
something.

43:37.640 --> 43:38.640
Oh, I like that idea.

43:38.640 --> 43:39.640
Wouldn't that be good?

43:39.640 --> 43:40.800
I would listen to that album.

43:40.800 --> 43:42.360
How about the food pyramid?

43:42.360 --> 43:45.280
That's a, that's a, that's like a, that's a six song EP.

43:45.280 --> 43:47.600
You have your song about wheats and grains.

43:47.600 --> 43:48.600
The organs of the body.

43:48.600 --> 43:49.600
Ooh, I like that.

43:49.600 --> 43:54.640
What about an EP about the different levels of terror alert that we could be in?

43:54.640 --> 43:55.640
I like that.

43:55.640 --> 43:57.640
What about the different levels of hell?

43:57.640 --> 43:58.640
That's not bad either.

43:58.640 --> 44:00.160
See, it sets you up a structure like that.

44:00.160 --> 44:03.760
I think you're going to do real well.

44:03.760 --> 44:06.840
I wouldn't read this Yahoo answer.

44:06.840 --> 44:10.160
It was sent in by Louis Dog, who has sent in a few things before.

44:10.160 --> 44:11.160
Thank you, Louis Dog.

44:11.160 --> 44:17.300
Uh, it's by Yahoo Answers user Michael Jean, who asks, should I tell my wife that I want

44:17.300 --> 44:21.560
to join a nude men's yoga group?

44:21.560 --> 44:25.960
I have been interested in learning about the benefits of practicing nude yoga.

44:25.960 --> 44:30.120
I have been practicing it at home in the nude for a year now.

44:30.120 --> 44:34.640
Online I have read about nude yoga groups practicing in a heated room and I would like

44:34.640 --> 44:36.140
to do it.

44:36.140 --> 44:38.280
These groups are generally filled with men.

44:38.280 --> 44:41.640
I'm not sure I should give my wife all of the details of what I want to do.

44:41.640 --> 44:48.120
I'm not gay, but I like the idea of being nude with other men.

44:48.120 --> 44:49.640
I don't know.

44:49.640 --> 44:56.280
I'm not so sure you know what gay means.

44:56.280 --> 44:58.800
Maybe that is a bigger, it's not.

44:58.800 --> 45:01.000
Maybe we need to define some terms here.

45:01.000 --> 45:02.000
Yeah.

45:02.000 --> 45:04.580
Do you like being nude with a bunch of other dudes?

45:04.580 --> 45:09.960
Is it fucked up that like I totally don't, I wouldn't have seen this as like a gay thing

45:09.960 --> 45:12.200
at all if the room wasn't heated?

45:12.200 --> 45:16.880
You know what I feel bad for?

45:16.880 --> 45:17.880
Who's that?

45:17.880 --> 45:21.700
I feel bad for the one dude in the group that rolled up like nude yoga, yeah I want to check

45:21.700 --> 45:22.960
out those girls bending around.

45:22.960 --> 45:23.960
Oh no.

45:23.960 --> 45:27.240
He rolls up and it's just a room full of dudes, but he's already committed.

45:27.240 --> 45:28.240
He can't leave.

45:28.240 --> 45:36.560
I mean, I am, I am, can you read to me the part where he says it's, these classes are

45:36.560 --> 45:37.920
usually what?

45:37.920 --> 45:41.200
These groups are generally filled with men.

45:41.200 --> 45:42.200
Filled with men.

45:42.200 --> 45:48.920
There's not like five or six, it turns into a big game of Twister.

45:48.920 --> 45:57.120
You are, listen, I don't care, gay, straight, bisexual, trans, you are going to see.

45:57.120 --> 46:07.080
If the room is literally filled with men, this heated ass room filled with men.

46:07.080 --> 46:11.600
It doesn't matter if you're not, if you're not gay, like first sunrise salutation that

46:11.600 --> 46:14.000
you do, you're going to get it.

46:14.000 --> 46:15.000
You're going to get it.

46:15.000 --> 46:20.000
It's like a furry quilt made of stinky pretzels, just a nightmare.

46:20.000 --> 46:22.360
It would just be the worst.

46:22.360 --> 46:27.000
I am, I, I have a couple of gay friends that I'm pretty sure would describe that as the

46:27.000 --> 46:28.000
gayest.

46:28.000 --> 46:29.000
The gayest.

46:29.000 --> 46:30.360
Like, and that's cool.

46:30.360 --> 46:32.940
Like just like accept that.

46:32.940 --> 46:37.320
Just accept it that you were the first down downwards facing dog.

46:37.320 --> 46:38.320
You're going to get it.

46:38.320 --> 46:39.320
That's not, no, no, no.

46:39.320 --> 46:41.440
He's going to be downward facing balls.

46:41.440 --> 46:43.440
I'm a, I'm a straight guy.

46:43.440 --> 46:47.600
I don't say, God, I wish it was just a big swimming pool filled with vaginas that I could

46:47.600 --> 46:48.600
jump into.

46:48.600 --> 46:50.720
Like that's the, that's what you're equating it to.

46:50.720 --> 46:51.720
Right.

46:51.720 --> 46:56.280
It's not really gay and like, it's not gay or straight, it's not a gay or straight issue.

46:56.280 --> 47:01.680
It's the fact that it's just gross, like it's gross.

47:01.680 --> 47:02.680
It's not like gay.

47:02.680 --> 47:07.600
Like I'm attracted to other guys, which means that I want to stretch it around with them

47:07.600 --> 47:11.680
and have them, some guy spraying his butt cheeks in front of me.

47:11.680 --> 47:15.000
Like I don't, let's, let's, let's redefine terms here.

47:15.000 --> 47:19.200
Instead of calling it a nude yoga class, let's say you're walking down a hallway and you

47:19.200 --> 47:23.080
turn to your friend and say, hey, Bill, do you want to go into that heated room filled

47:23.080 --> 47:24.080
with naked guys?

47:24.080 --> 47:25.080
It's heated.

47:25.080 --> 47:26.400
It's so hot in here.

47:26.400 --> 47:29.080
I am sweating so much.

47:29.080 --> 47:30.080
I would say glistening.

47:30.080 --> 47:31.080
Yeah.

47:31.080 --> 47:32.080
Thank you.

47:32.080 --> 47:33.080
You're a very gay man.

47:33.080 --> 47:34.080
He was comfortable with that.

47:34.080 --> 47:38.040
I'm uncomfortable with the fact that I'm so very gay.

47:38.040 --> 47:44.680
This is weird because it's like the, it's like a scorched earth policy to being gay.

47:44.680 --> 47:49.200
Like you can't have sex with guys because you're married, so you do something gayer

47:49.200 --> 47:50.560
than have sex with men.

47:50.560 --> 47:53.560
It's like, we found it.

47:53.560 --> 47:58.560
We just broke the world.

47:58.560 --> 47:59.560
Eureka!

47:59.560 --> 48:12.480
Now, now, if you did yoga in a heated room with a bunch of people dressed up like animals,

48:12.480 --> 48:15.040
how does that rate on the scale that we've created?

48:15.040 --> 48:17.680
It rates on the scale of, why did Justin go to jail?

48:17.680 --> 48:20.280
Did you hear he burned that building down?

48:20.280 --> 48:23.840
He burned a building full of other people in it to the ground, but I heard they're furries,

48:23.840 --> 48:24.840
so it's okay.

48:24.840 --> 48:25.840
Okay.

48:25.840 --> 48:27.880
I do want to hear Griffin's last question.

48:27.880 --> 48:32.400
I don't know how he's going to top that last, Jim, but we got a couple of quick housekeeping

48:32.400 --> 48:33.400
things.

48:33.400 --> 48:37.360
The site mbmbam.com is live and new.

48:37.360 --> 48:43.120
If you like new sites, check out annafurlaxis.com, she's a friend of the show.

48:43.120 --> 48:47.560
She's a burlesque knife thrower, she just relaunched her site.

48:47.560 --> 48:49.080
We are going to have new gear.

48:49.080 --> 48:50.080
It's fresh, by the way.

48:50.080 --> 48:51.080
I checked it out.

48:51.080 --> 48:52.080
It's fresh.

48:52.080 --> 48:53.080
Yeah.

48:53.080 --> 48:54.080
It's awesome.

48:54.080 --> 48:55.080
New gear is going to be up.

48:55.080 --> 48:56.080
Gear.

48:56.080 --> 48:57.080
No, I like it.

48:57.080 --> 48:58.080
Okay.

48:58.080 --> 48:59.080
New gear.

48:59.080 --> 49:00.080
New mbmbam gear is going to be up.

49:00.080 --> 49:01.080
New equipment.

49:01.080 --> 49:02.080
Probably the next week or so.

49:02.080 --> 49:03.080
Got the coffee mug.

49:03.080 --> 49:04.080
Got a girl's shirt.

49:04.080 --> 49:05.080
Got a pack your bags and move away shirt.

49:05.080 --> 49:06.080
Not a girl size shirt.

49:06.080 --> 49:07.560
We just, we got a girl's shirt.

49:07.560 --> 49:08.560
Yeah.

49:08.560 --> 49:09.560
We got it.

49:09.560 --> 49:11.280
We're auctioning it off to the highest loanless bidder.

49:11.280 --> 49:12.280
Smells so great.

49:12.280 --> 49:13.280
Wow.

49:13.280 --> 49:14.280
Still smells like girl.

49:14.280 --> 49:15.280
Smells like a girl.

49:15.280 --> 49:17.880
We vacuum sealed it.

49:17.880 --> 49:18.880
So do that.

49:18.880 --> 49:20.880
Get on those forums.

49:20.880 --> 49:23.280
There's great discussions going on there.

49:23.280 --> 49:24.280
Really is.

49:24.280 --> 49:28.200
I'm seeing a lot of people talking about like books that they like and music that they like

49:28.200 --> 49:29.720
and other podcasts that they listen to.

49:29.720 --> 49:30.880
Like it's a community.

49:30.880 --> 49:31.880
It's a real community.

49:31.880 --> 49:32.880
It is a community.

49:32.880 --> 49:36.200
It's such a specific thread.

49:36.200 --> 49:39.480
I'm going to have, you know what, I'll just tell Craig now.

49:39.480 --> 49:41.360
We need a thread for people to introduce themselves.

49:41.360 --> 49:42.360
We're making.

49:42.360 --> 49:43.360
No, that exists.

49:43.360 --> 49:44.360
It's stickied.

49:44.360 --> 49:45.360
What's up?

49:45.360 --> 49:46.360
It's stickied.

49:46.360 --> 49:47.360
Is it?

49:47.360 --> 49:48.360
What's up?

49:48.360 --> 49:49.360
God.

49:49.360 --> 49:51.560
I don't know if that was Craig or not, but good on you, Craig.

49:51.560 --> 49:55.000
And I know we've got some new designs coming up.

49:55.000 --> 49:57.360
Actually I just got them in the mail.

49:57.360 --> 49:58.360
They look dope.

49:58.360 --> 49:59.360
Oh, I didn't know that.

49:59.360 --> 50:00.360
Yeah.

50:00.360 --> 50:01.360
I know.

50:01.360 --> 50:02.360
I'm going to have to show them off.

50:02.360 --> 50:03.360
Yeah.

50:03.360 --> 50:05.920
And then, you know, just, oh, Twitter.

50:05.920 --> 50:08.200
You can tweet about us.

50:08.200 --> 50:09.200
Use the hashtag NBNBAM.com.

50:09.200 --> 50:10.200
Just use hashtag NBNBAM.

50:10.200 --> 50:19.520
Oh, I was just going to say we started something on Twitter in the middle of this week that

50:19.520 --> 50:26.160
if you go on iTunes and review and rate the show, I'll give you a personalized compliment

50:26.160 --> 50:28.080
and I'm enjoying it way more than you are.

50:28.080 --> 50:29.080
So do it.

50:29.080 --> 50:30.080
Cause I like complimenting people.

50:30.080 --> 50:33.800
So basically you review the show, either the show or the experience, and then you tweet

50:33.800 --> 50:34.880
about it.

50:34.880 --> 50:40.400
Make sure you use either the NBNBAM hashtag or at Travis.

50:40.400 --> 50:43.840
Don't just at Travis cause we want everybody to see that you're your dedication.

50:43.840 --> 50:48.880
But Travis will give you a personalized compliment just for you.

50:48.880 --> 50:54.120
And tell a friend, tell a friend to give them Bern OCD with a couple of shows on it.

50:54.120 --> 50:55.120
Cause you know what?

50:55.120 --> 50:59.160
Next week is our 30th episode and I think that the best way that we could celebrate

50:59.160 --> 51:03.240
is by reaching out to a whole new generation of listeners.

51:03.240 --> 51:07.240
If you listen to the first 29 apps, you are officially on the ground floor.

51:07.240 --> 51:11.960
I know we keep pushing that bar back, but you, if you're listening to this now, congratulations,

51:11.960 --> 51:12.960
you're on the ground floor.

51:12.960 --> 51:13.960
It's time to evangelize.

51:13.960 --> 51:14.960
Awesome.

51:14.960 --> 51:18.440
Okay guys, well Griffin hit me with that last big question.

51:18.440 --> 51:19.440
Sure.

51:19.440 --> 51:24.360
This one was sent in by Jonathan Bartram, who's got a two show streak going.

51:24.360 --> 51:25.360
It's by Yahoo!

51:25.360 --> 51:33.120
user Arianna, who asks, poll, should I get high today?

51:33.120 --> 51:40.160
This is Justin McElroy, I'm voting yes.

51:40.160 --> 51:45.040
This is Travis McElroy, I'm voting yes.

51:45.040 --> 51:47.040
I'm Griffin McElroy, I'm gonna say no.

51:47.040 --> 51:54.720
This has been my brother, my brother and me, Mr. Dianis, going to wear on the lips.

51:54.720 --> 51:59.760
Keep your heart, three stacks, keep your heart, hey, keep your heart, three stacks, keep your

51:59.760 --> 52:00.760
heart.

52:00.760 --> 52:04.280
Man, these girls are smart, three stacks, these girls are smart.

52:04.280 --> 52:07.780
Play your part.

52:07.780 --> 52:12.760
The best answer on that last question, it was by Yahoo!

52:12.760 --> 52:21.240
answers user Geeks or Freaks, who responded, if you do, this might happen, with a link

52:21.240 --> 52:31.400
to Afro Man's Because I Got High music video, and then she adds, lol, listen to the lyrics.

52:31.400 --> 52:34.680
