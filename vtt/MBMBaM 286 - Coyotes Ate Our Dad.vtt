00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:31.840
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:31.840 --> 00:48.080
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me. My name is Justin McElroy. I'm

00:48.080 --> 00:52.000
your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm Travis McElroy, your middle-est brother,

00:52.000 --> 00:57.200
Travis Patrick McElroy. And I am the being formerly known as Griffin McElroy, who has

00:57.200 --> 01:05.520
transcended into a ball of energy that now surfs the cosmos on a wave of pure energy and joy.

01:05.520 --> 01:06.960
You made it to the next level.

01:06.960 --> 01:11.120
I'm thrilled to hear about your ascendance, Griffin. What was the motivator behind it?

01:11.120 --> 01:14.720
Sorry, I am getting, I guess, a little bit nostalgic, but I am no longer

01:15.440 --> 01:22.160
the one called Griffin. I am now just sort of a being that is just light, if you can imagine that.

01:22.160 --> 01:27.280
Okay. Can we just go with Griffin with like a lowercase g, like you're no longer identified as

01:27.280 --> 01:35.680
the noun Griffin, but now just the idea? I guess so. We apply the word Griffin to the energy space

01:35.680 --> 01:41.680
that you are inhabiting, Griffin. Can you just call me Delight? Okay, Delight. That's cool. Bliss.

01:42.240 --> 01:47.360
Bliss. This is my brother, Delight Bliss. Yeah, that's me. Bliss Delight. Delight

01:47.360 --> 01:53.040
Blissington. This is my brother, Bliss Delight. What happened? It's pretty cool out here in the

01:53.040 --> 01:58.160
cosmos, I got to say. Just surfing by Alpha Centauri, just seeing what's beautiful and

01:58.160 --> 02:02.960
you know what the answer is? Fucking everything, guys. Look around. Bliss Delight, how did this

02:03.920 --> 02:12.640
state befall you? Well, it started like all good stories with a harrowing journey through the

02:12.640 --> 02:18.800
darkness as a future EGOT winner, Lin-Manuel Miranda, just started buffeting me with pictures

02:18.800 --> 02:24.960
of gold dust, which you know I didn't like. Every day I would wake up and the pictures of gold dust

02:24.960 --> 02:31.840
that I had just like shoveled out of my sinking security boat, you know what I mean? Like my own

02:31.840 --> 02:37.680
sort of sense of self security, self preservation. We've all read Malcolm Gladwell books. We know all

02:37.680 --> 02:42.400
about your security boat and all of that. We got you. I had to get these pictures of gold dust out

02:42.400 --> 02:46.720
of my boat. Every morning I wake up, more pictures in the boat and there was a malevolent, I'll go

02:46.720 --> 02:53.600
ahead and call him a demon. Lin-Manuel Miranda, Hamilton creator and demon. Lin-Manuel Miranda

02:53.600 --> 02:58.480
just covered me in these pics and finally when I reached my breaking point, I could take no more,

02:59.920 --> 03:06.800
he turned into an angel. It's kind of like a reverse Satan. He pulled like a reverse Satan

03:06.800 --> 03:13.920
720 heel flip. Which will get you like super high points on Tony Hawk. Yeah of course, if you do it

03:13.920 --> 03:21.520
at the end of your combo. He sent a video, he secured a video of Carly Rae Jepsen wishing me,

03:21.520 --> 03:27.200
just saying that I was doing a great job. And that's when my transformation began.

03:27.760 --> 03:31.120
Like Rachel was home when it happened, she was like whoa Griffin, light's coming out of your

03:31.120 --> 03:35.680
fingertips and all your teeth. And I was like yeah, I think something big is, I think the

03:35.680 --> 03:41.440
winds of change are blowing. Something big is in the works. My current body is a trailer for my

03:41.440 --> 03:46.320
future body. Exactly, and this happened the afternoon after we recorded the last episode,

03:46.320 --> 03:50.160
so we didn't really get a chance to talk about it. And I'm glad we didn't, because this morning I

03:50.160 --> 03:55.840
woke up to another video of... It's weird to even say it out loud, isn't it? It's weird,

03:55.840 --> 03:59.200
this is I guess the first time I've said it out loud. Tyra Banks saying that I did a great job.

03:59.200 --> 04:07.280
Ty Ty baby. Ty Ty baby. She didn't blow me a kiss like CRJ did, and that was, I mean,

04:07.280 --> 04:11.040
an important catalyst in the transformation. But yeah, now I'm just sort of like a being of joy,

04:11.040 --> 04:16.000
and I just sort of surfed the cosmos. I'm going up Orion's belt right now and going under the

04:16.000 --> 04:20.560
belt and checking out his stick. Don't look to the left. Nope, I already did. It's beautiful,

04:20.560 --> 04:25.520
all of creation guys, look around. Orion has a beautiful hog. Beautiful hog on Orion,

04:25.520 --> 04:35.040
look around guys. I actually woke my wife and infant daughter up this morning by about 745,

04:35.040 --> 04:40.000
I guess it was 745-8, something like that. Just loudly exclaiming, that motherfucker.

04:40.960 --> 04:45.680
I just watched the video. That's how he does you, hot and cold. That's what makes Hamilton

04:45.680 --> 04:51.200
such a great creative endeavor, is it comes at you hot and cold. And that's Lin himself,

04:51.200 --> 04:58.240
man. He is- He'll torture you, and then just when you think, I can't handle it anymore,

04:58.240 --> 05:03.280
he brings you the coolest bowl of water, and you're just like, oh, relief.

05:03.280 --> 05:10.880
A cool, sweet bowl of water, of sweet, sweet water, yeah. And that's what CRJ and Tyra mean to

05:10.880 --> 05:17.280
me. Literally, just the two best people in the world, and now they've said my name, or my former

05:17.280 --> 05:22.320
name, because now I'm Bliss Delight. Correct. It's going to make podcasting maybe a little

05:22.320 --> 05:25.680
bit harder, because I can't click the stop button on my mouse to stop this recording.

05:25.680 --> 05:29.680
How did you start it? I have a helper. Helper monkey?

05:29.680 --> 05:33.280
I have a helper monkey that does my podcast buttons for me. Who ironically is named Griffin.

05:33.840 --> 05:35.920
Yes. No relation.

05:35.920 --> 05:40.640
No relation whatsoever. So can we assume if we say Griffin in the next hour or so-

05:40.640 --> 05:45.120
I will not answer, that's right. But Travis and I are talking to your monkey,

05:45.120 --> 05:47.360
who will then pass the message on to you through vibration.

05:47.360 --> 05:49.520
I think he'll fucking hear you and talk to you, idiot.

05:49.520 --> 05:53.760
It's also important to note, Justin, that Griffin the helper monkey is spelled with an E-N

05:53.760 --> 05:56.480
at the end, so make sure to pronounce that.

05:56.480 --> 05:58.720
Just because I'm a being of pure joy energy,

05:58.720 --> 06:01.520
doesn't mean I'm not going to call you guys out on your shit, okay?

06:01.520 --> 06:05.520
Can we still make weird references to 80s cartoons that no one else has seen?

06:05.520 --> 06:08.720
Absolutely. I'm a little bit above that now, having transcended.

06:08.720 --> 06:09.040
Sure.

06:09.040 --> 06:13.760
But whatever you guys feel like you want to do, I will support you in that. Unless it's

06:13.760 --> 06:17.200
really dumb, in which case, you know Bliss Delight's not going to stand for that.

06:17.200 --> 06:18.480
All right. Travis, Bliss Delight, here we go.

06:18.480 --> 06:22.080
Also, I've been watching a lot of RuPaul's Drag Race, and I have decided to become

06:22.880 --> 06:26.320
America's Next Drag Superstar. And my name, yes, conveniently enough,

06:26.320 --> 06:27.840
will just become Bliss Delight.

06:27.840 --> 06:28.080
Yeah.

06:28.080 --> 06:30.560
All right. Can we also say real quick, happy birthday, Lynn.

06:30.560 --> 06:31.280
Happy birthday, Lynn.

06:31.280 --> 06:33.040
Yeah. We didn't say that last time I said it.

06:33.040 --> 06:33.520
Yeah. You're the best.

06:33.520 --> 06:38.560
Much like Justin and Travis's birthdays, I got gifts on it, which I really appreciate.

06:39.440 --> 06:42.560
I'm getting married and want a surprise bachelor party.

06:42.560 --> 06:46.000
The problem is that my male friends don't know each other that well,

06:46.000 --> 06:49.280
and none of them are the planning or implement type.

06:49.280 --> 06:51.920
I can't see them calling the others and starting it up.

06:51.920 --> 06:54.880
I don't want to tell them what to do because I really want it to be a surprise.

06:54.880 --> 06:57.040
That's from Surprizeless in Stockholm.

06:57.840 --> 07:01.680
You cannot want surprises. You can't want them.

07:01.680 --> 07:04.320
You can't make surprises happen to you.

07:04.320 --> 07:04.960
Yeah.

07:04.960 --> 07:07.520
Also, surprises are the fucking worst.

07:07.520 --> 07:12.000
Yeah, this is the equivalent of like sitting on your hand till it goes

07:12.000 --> 07:13.840
over masturbating, giving yourself a stranger.

07:13.840 --> 07:15.120
That's exactly what it is, Justin.

07:15.120 --> 07:16.480
You can't make surprises that way.

07:16.480 --> 07:18.080
Let me check the book.

07:18.080 --> 07:19.520
Flip, flip, flip, flip, flip.

07:19.520 --> 07:21.520
Yeah. Oh, it's a one-in-one correlation.

07:21.520 --> 07:22.560
You are absolutely correct.

07:22.560 --> 07:24.960
It's not even a metaphor. It's just literally the exact same thing.

07:24.960 --> 07:25.680
It's just true.

07:26.240 --> 07:33.440
If I, almost 10 days ago now, when the chrysalis of light was formed around me,

07:33.440 --> 07:38.880
had said like, boy, I sure hope that my friend Lynn sends me a cool video of my favorite musician,

07:38.880 --> 07:41.280
Carly Rae Jepsen, saying that I was doing a great job.

07:41.280 --> 07:45.040
I don't think the, I don't think I would have actually had the energy to begin

07:45.040 --> 07:45.840
pupating a multiverse guy.

07:45.840 --> 07:47.920
I'm not sure the universe would have delivered it to you.

07:48.560 --> 07:49.360
That's a good point.

07:49.360 --> 07:49.600
Actually.

07:49.600 --> 07:51.520
That's the secret. Well, it's the opposite of the secret.

07:51.520 --> 07:52.400
Opposite of the secret.

07:52.400 --> 07:54.320
The secret explicitly tells you.

07:54.320 --> 07:57.280
Yeah. The secret just tells you, get that fucking, get that surprise.

07:57.280 --> 07:58.240
Get that surprise.

07:58.880 --> 08:00.720
That was the original name of the book. Get that surprise.

08:00.720 --> 08:03.440
Get that surprise, hyphen, catch that kid.

08:04.560 --> 08:05.360
You cannot.

08:05.360 --> 08:06.640
Catch that kid.

08:06.640 --> 08:08.720
It's one of my favorite running flop house jokes.

08:08.720 --> 08:12.720
Travis is making references to other podcasts, which don't exist in the reality of this podcast.

08:12.720 --> 08:14.160
That is non-canonical.

08:14.160 --> 08:15.200
That's non-canonical.

08:19.200 --> 08:21.040
It's not to say I don't think those guys exist.

08:21.040 --> 08:24.320
I'm saying that no other podcast exists in this fiction.

08:24.320 --> 08:25.040
You're with me.

08:25.040 --> 08:25.360
Okay.

08:25.360 --> 08:26.960
Cause it's my favorite podcast.

08:26.960 --> 08:27.680
One of them.

08:27.680 --> 08:28.720
I mean, I like other podcasts.

08:28.720 --> 08:29.440
Fuck.

08:29.440 --> 08:35.120
You can't just want a surprise and not say anything about it also.

08:35.120 --> 08:36.960
You can't get to get it both ways.

08:36.960 --> 08:39.680
Either you're the engineer of your own surprise destiny,

08:39.680 --> 08:43.200
or you just roll them bones and hope the universe delivers you something.

08:43.200 --> 08:46.480
Well, and the nice thing is here, you could lay out a framework.

08:46.480 --> 08:51.120
Like you don't have to break down every individual event that you want them to take you to.

08:51.120 --> 08:55.440
You just have to call your most reliable friend out of this group and say,

08:55.440 --> 08:58.000
I want you guys to do something.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.160
Here's everyone's emails and phone numbers.

09:00.160 --> 09:01.440
Contact me again in three months.

09:01.440 --> 09:05.120
My boy, we've spent three minutes saying not to explicitly not to do that.

09:05.120 --> 09:06.560
And you've just fucking revolted.

09:06.560 --> 09:07.920
You're just betraying me and Justin.

09:07.920 --> 09:13.040
All you need to do is say, I want a surprise, but not what the surprise must be.

09:14.720 --> 09:16.960
But we're all, that's not, that's terrible advice.

09:16.960 --> 09:19.760
Cause we're all, we're all wanting surprises.

09:19.760 --> 09:22.000
We all want surprises all the time.

09:22.000 --> 09:22.480
All the time.

09:22.480 --> 09:23.600
Wait, let me roll it back.

09:23.600 --> 09:24.720
I have a different suggestion.

09:25.280 --> 09:25.680
Great.

09:25.680 --> 09:29.040
You need to make a new friend before the bachelor party

09:29.040 --> 09:32.160
who is reliable and organized and a planning friend.

09:32.160 --> 09:33.040
Oh my God.

09:33.040 --> 09:34.640
That's such a good idea, Travis.

09:34.640 --> 09:39.840
You have like a screening process to ask people about their event planning backgrounds.

09:39.840 --> 09:44.160
And then you ask them like, what's their, what's their favorite doctor?

09:44.160 --> 09:45.360
What do they like on their pizza?

09:45.360 --> 09:46.960
Just like friendship screening questions.

09:46.960 --> 09:49.920
But keep circling back around to like, so what are we talking about?

09:49.920 --> 09:53.200
100, 150 type person engagements?

09:53.200 --> 09:55.680
Like how big of an engagement have you planned before?

09:55.680 --> 09:57.120
How responsible are you?

09:57.120 --> 09:59.440
Is there like a bachelor party planning?

09:59.440 --> 10:00.880
Like you get a wedding planner.

10:00.880 --> 10:03.280
That's exactly, you're on my fucking wavelength.

10:03.280 --> 10:04.560
Is it too late?

10:04.560 --> 10:09.680
To get David Tutera on board to plan your shit.

10:10.880 --> 10:12.000
Who's David Tutera?

10:14.960 --> 10:16.400
You guys are fucking bringing my light down.

10:16.400 --> 10:17.040
Do you know that?

10:17.040 --> 10:20.160
I've been surfing the fucking cosmos now for about seven hours.

10:20.720 --> 10:22.480
And then this is, this is the event.

10:22.480 --> 10:25.840
You asking me who David Tutera host of my fair wedding.

10:25.840 --> 10:31.520
Only the best wedding planning show in history, in reality.

10:32.480 --> 10:33.040
Nevermind.

10:33.040 --> 10:34.720
Move on.

10:34.720 --> 10:35.680
Oh, okay.

10:35.680 --> 10:37.600
A new show, new show title.

10:37.600 --> 10:38.880
Say match to the batch.

10:40.960 --> 10:43.200
And it's, you get a guy who plans your bachelor party

10:43.200 --> 10:45.040
and you just gotta say like, ah, naturally.

10:46.160 --> 10:47.200
You just gotta be on board.

10:47.200 --> 10:50.320
You just gotta be on board with whatever the bachelor party planner

10:50.320 --> 10:51.440
throws out at you.

10:51.440 --> 10:52.080
And you know what?

10:52.080 --> 10:54.560
Maybe you didn't even know it was the surprise you wanted,

10:54.560 --> 10:56.240
but it was the surprise you needed.

10:56.240 --> 10:59.280
Where he's just like, first, we're going to a strip club.

10:59.280 --> 11:01.920
Then we're going to have brunch with your biological dad.

11:01.920 --> 11:02.960
And you're like, what?

11:02.960 --> 11:03.760
I'm adopted.

11:03.760 --> 11:04.800
And you didn't even know.

11:05.520 --> 11:09.040
We're going to pause the fucking podcast recording right now for two hours.

11:09.040 --> 11:11.680
So you creeps can go watch My Fair Wedding with David Tutera.

11:11.680 --> 11:13.360
Just pick any two episodes.

11:13.360 --> 11:17.520
Throw a dart at your TV when Netflix is on My Fair Wedding by David Tutera

11:17.520 --> 11:19.840
because he would be the ideal host of this show.

11:19.840 --> 11:21.760
Do you know this motherfucker planned a wedding?

11:21.760 --> 11:24.160
And all he had to go on was this bride.

11:24.160 --> 11:25.120
Her name was Candace.

11:25.120 --> 11:26.960
And he said, what do you want the theme of the wedding to be?

11:26.960 --> 11:28.800
And she said, Candace chic.

11:28.800 --> 11:29.760
And he said, fuck.

11:30.400 --> 11:31.200
Okay.

11:31.200 --> 11:35.040
And he did it, and he crushed it.

11:35.040 --> 11:37.440
Candace chic, he said.

11:37.440 --> 11:38.160
I have this.

11:39.120 --> 11:40.320
He could do anything with it.

11:40.320 --> 11:41.840
He would throw the perfect bachelor party,

11:41.840 --> 11:43.120
but you would have to befriend him,

11:43.120 --> 11:45.120
which is a service I think you'd probably lend out.

11:45.120 --> 11:48.160
That's a, man, I feel like we really solved that one.

11:48.160 --> 11:49.680
Yeah, I feel like we fixed it.

11:49.680 --> 11:52.080
Like, David Tutera, get him on the phone.

11:53.360 --> 11:53.760
Do it.

11:54.320 --> 11:55.520
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

11:55.520 --> 11:55.920
Please.

11:55.920 --> 12:00.240
Uh, this Yahoo was, I mean, there are a lot of doozers.

12:00.240 --> 12:01.120
Maybe it's because we went,

12:01.120 --> 12:03.040
oh, we recorded the last episode kind of early,

12:03.040 --> 12:05.840
and so we had like more Yahoo receiving days.

12:05.840 --> 12:08.800
But man, there's some slam dunkerrooskies up in here.

12:08.800 --> 12:09.520
Let's start with this one.

12:09.520 --> 12:11.280
It's from Brooks Oglesby.

12:11.280 --> 12:12.480
Thank you, Brooks.

12:12.480 --> 12:15.280
It's by Yahoo Answers user unknown.

12:15.280 --> 12:16.800
That's not like, they're not anonymous.

12:16.800 --> 12:17.600
That's like the name they've,

12:17.600 --> 12:19.360
the designation they've chosen for themselves.

12:19.360 --> 12:21.280
Ooh, is it spelled correctly?

12:22.000 --> 12:23.120
Uh, it is, yeah.

12:23.120 --> 12:24.640
How did they get that?

12:24.640 --> 12:26.960
Uh, unknown asks,

12:28.640 --> 12:32.400
I need a funny meme for a girl I didn't mean to hurt.

12:34.160 --> 12:34.800
What?

12:34.800 --> 12:38.080
So basically, she kind of liked me, and I said no.

12:38.080 --> 12:39.920
I was following bro code.

12:39.920 --> 12:42.400
And we used to have meme arguments,

12:42.400 --> 12:44.480
so I want to make a meme for her

12:44.480 --> 12:47.120
so that she knows I still like her as a friend.

12:47.120 --> 12:50.320
I saw a really good one that had forever alone face to it,

12:50.320 --> 12:51.440
but I'm not sure.

12:51.440 --> 12:53.600
It said, they say love can hurt,

12:53.600 --> 12:55.360
so watch out and be clever.

12:55.360 --> 12:56.960
Don't start a conversation.

12:56.960 --> 12:58.960
Stay forever alone.

12:58.960 --> 13:02.000
And I'd send that to her with the forever alone face,

13:02.000 --> 13:04.080
but I think that one would do more bad than good,

13:04.080 --> 13:05.040
so help me out.

13:05.040 --> 13:05.680
Help me out.

13:06.240 --> 13:06.960
Help me out.

13:06.960 --> 13:07.760
Help me out.

13:07.760 --> 13:10.160
I need a funny meme for a girl I didn't mean to hurt.

13:10.160 --> 13:12.880
Should I send her one that says she'll be alone forever,

13:12.880 --> 13:15.360
or do you think maybe that might do more harm than good?

13:15.360 --> 13:16.880
You just don't, you don't get the meme.

13:17.440 --> 13:19.920
You don't get the meme.

13:19.920 --> 13:20.720
I don't.

13:20.720 --> 13:23.840
I, if, I love these memes.

13:24.640 --> 13:26.080
I just, we love this meme.

13:26.800 --> 13:28.800
You're crazy for this meme.

13:28.800 --> 13:30.400
Memes, right?

13:31.120 --> 13:33.280
A lot of people are talking about them,

13:33.280 --> 13:34.640
and even more people wonder,

13:34.640 --> 13:36.160
what are you talking about really with that?

13:36.160 --> 13:37.280
What the fuck are you saying?

13:37.280 --> 13:37.920
What's a meme?

13:37.920 --> 13:39.360
What do you mean with meme?

13:39.360 --> 13:42.400
Like I know, like my generation invented meme,

13:42.400 --> 13:46.240
and it had like an actual memeing, a meaning.

13:46.800 --> 13:47.680
No, memeing.

13:47.680 --> 13:48.480
We're keeping that.

13:48.480 --> 13:51.360
Memeing, where it had like what it meant was like

13:52.400 --> 13:54.240
some shit that wasn't really funny,

13:54.240 --> 13:56.720
but it popped up enough times on internet,

13:56.720 --> 13:58.080
or maybe it was funny,

13:58.080 --> 13:59.600
and it just got like endlessly.

14:00.320 --> 14:00.800
Yeah.

14:00.800 --> 14:03.280
Just eviscerated by repetition,

14:03.280 --> 14:06.720
and it became like part of the internet vocabulary.

14:06.720 --> 14:06.960
Right.

14:06.960 --> 14:09.920
Like here are some good memes that I know about, okay?

14:09.920 --> 14:11.600
Mr. T ate my balls.

14:11.600 --> 14:12.080
The end.

14:14.320 --> 14:16.000
That's the only one that is it.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.440
That's the only good meme?

14:17.440 --> 14:20.480
The only good meme is Mr. T ate my balls.

14:20.480 --> 14:21.600
Here's what I'm imagining.

14:21.600 --> 14:26.400
This boy, this young man shot down this young woman,

14:27.120 --> 14:28.880
and he was following bro code,

14:28.880 --> 14:30.240
no fucking clue what that means,

14:31.840 --> 14:33.440
and he needs to make it up to her.

14:33.440 --> 14:35.280
So imagine they're on the quad,

14:35.280 --> 14:36.720
and he walks right up to her,

14:36.720 --> 14:38.400
because you gotta have courage in a situation like this.

14:38.400 --> 14:40.400
You can't fucking back burner this stuff.

14:40.400 --> 14:42.480
You can't take it through the back channels.

14:42.480 --> 14:44.880
When you've hurt somebody, don't back channel it.

14:44.880 --> 14:48.800
For the front approach, and he walks up to her,

14:48.800 --> 14:51.280
and he just goes, hey, Star Wars kid.

14:53.200 --> 14:54.080
Think about it.

14:54.080 --> 14:55.600
Hey, drunk baby.

14:55.600 --> 14:57.120
Hey, did you hear?

14:58.640 --> 15:00.240
David after dentist.

15:00.240 --> 15:02.880
And he just hands her a printed out meme.

15:02.880 --> 15:05.680
Hey, David after dentist, I don't love you.

15:08.080 --> 15:10.640
Hey, Charlie bit my finger and told me

15:10.640 --> 15:12.000
that I shouldn't date you.

15:13.440 --> 15:14.640
He was very wise.

15:14.640 --> 15:16.480
I don't love you anymore.

15:17.840 --> 15:20.160
That video where the guy does the nunchuck stunts,

15:20.160 --> 15:21.200
and then tries to do a back flip,

15:21.200 --> 15:22.160
and he lands on his neck.

15:23.600 --> 15:25.360
Hey, I'm sorry I hurt you.

15:25.360 --> 15:28.160
Also, here's a guy jumping into a frozen pool.

15:28.160 --> 15:29.040
Excuse me.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.760
Cancel the question.

15:31.760 --> 15:32.160
Uh oh.

15:32.720 --> 15:39.360
Mr. T ate my balls is 20 years old in 2016.

15:39.920 --> 15:44.400
This year marks the 20th anniversary celebration

15:44.400 --> 15:48.480
of the first launch of the anchor

15:48.480 --> 15:50.400
of the Ate My Balls web ring,

15:51.040 --> 15:52.880
Mr. T Ate My Balls.

15:52.880 --> 15:54.960
Launched, of course, by Nihal Patel,

15:54.960 --> 15:58.560
a University of Illinois student in 1996.

15:58.560 --> 15:59.200
Oh my God.

16:01.040 --> 16:01.840
I don't know this thing.

16:01.840 --> 16:02.880
I don't know this thing.

16:02.880 --> 16:05.280
Okay, well, that's because this is literally

16:05.280 --> 16:06.960
like your dad's meme.

16:06.960 --> 16:08.880
This is your dad's meme right now.

16:10.320 --> 16:11.760
Let me just give you the web address.

16:11.760 --> 16:15.200
Go to flamesgif.com slash archive

16:15.200 --> 16:18.240
slash eight underscore my underscore balls

16:18.240 --> 16:20.000
slash Mr. Underscore T,

16:20.640 --> 16:22.880
or just search for Mr. T Ate My Balls.

16:22.880 --> 16:24.160
What you're gonna get is pictures.

16:24.160 --> 16:26.480
This is what passed for memes in my day.

16:27.040 --> 16:29.520
20 years ago.

16:30.160 --> 16:34.000
Mr. T Ate My Balls is sort of like a progenitor of our show

16:34.880 --> 16:36.640
because it's pictures of Mr. T

16:37.200 --> 16:39.440
talking about how he wants to eat balls

16:39.440 --> 16:41.360
and maybe he ate your balls

16:41.360 --> 16:44.080
or perhaps he was planning on enjoying your balls later

16:44.080 --> 16:46.160
or perhaps he had enjoyed your balls previously

16:46.160 --> 16:48.000
and would like a repeat performance

16:48.000 --> 16:50.560
should you have any more balls for him to ingest

16:50.560 --> 16:52.480
because Mr. T Ate My Balls.

16:52.480 --> 16:54.960
So it felt like a clever turn of phrase.

16:54.960 --> 16:58.080
Just to catch everybody up on like my current light journey,

16:58.720 --> 17:01.360
I'm having like a full blown panic attack right now

17:01.360 --> 17:03.440
and it makes it hard to sort of sustain.

17:03.440 --> 17:04.160
And if I lose it,

17:04.160 --> 17:05.920
I'll just be floating in space forever lost

17:05.920 --> 17:07.040
in my human form.

17:07.040 --> 17:08.960
Well, if you need a reference,

17:08.960 --> 17:11.200
if this book sounds familiar to me,

17:11.200 --> 17:12.560
it's probably because you've read about it

17:12.560 --> 17:14.080
in Dave Barry's book,

17:14.080 --> 17:16.160
Dave Barry in Cyberspace,

17:16.160 --> 17:20.320
which I bet has the choices cover in the world.

17:20.320 --> 17:23.520
I bet it's Dave Barry floating through stars

17:23.520 --> 17:26.320
and his fingers are plugged into electrical outlets

17:26.320 --> 17:29.040
and he's got like bits and bytes all over his face.

17:29.040 --> 17:30.880
And you know, you want to know the incredible thing?

17:30.880 --> 17:32.960
That book is 120 years old.

17:33.600 --> 17:36.160
He's like the Nostradamus of comedy

17:36.160 --> 17:39.440
somehow in like 1896.

17:39.440 --> 17:41.760
Dave Barry, Lord Dave Barry said,

17:41.760 --> 17:43.600
someday Mr. T will eat some balls.

17:43.600 --> 17:45.200
By the way, a little bit of a disappointment

17:45.200 --> 17:47.520
is just Dave Barry reaching out of a computer screen

17:47.520 --> 17:50.080
and pressing a key on your computer.

17:50.080 --> 17:51.280
Which is how he kills you.

17:51.920 --> 17:54.320
To help you get over that disappointment,

17:54.320 --> 17:58.400
I have just purchased a copy of Dave Barry in Cyberspace

17:58.400 --> 18:00.320
and the next like three episodes

18:00.320 --> 18:01.760
can just be readings, I think.

18:02.640 --> 18:03.680
Wait, are you joking?

18:03.680 --> 18:05.520
Because if you are not joking,

18:05.520 --> 18:06.400
I will do this thing.

18:07.200 --> 18:08.800
No, I'm doing, it's done.

18:08.800 --> 18:10.160
It's doing this thing, okay.

18:10.160 --> 18:12.320
Yeah, like Amazon is like, yeah, we got you.

18:12.880 --> 18:14.480
And then the mailman is going to show up to my house

18:14.480 --> 18:15.280
like, we got you.

18:15.280 --> 18:16.560
Make some good comedy out of this.

18:16.560 --> 18:18.240
You paid 13 fucking dollars for it.

18:18.240 --> 18:20.160
Next year is the 20th anniversary

18:20.160 --> 18:22.000
of Dave Barry in Cyberspace.

18:22.000 --> 18:25.840
So like, I guess he did this the year after Mr. T ate my balls.

18:25.840 --> 18:27.920
He's like, I've got to get on the internet.

18:27.920 --> 18:30.400
Yeah, yeah, I miss him so much.

18:30.400 --> 18:31.600
Fuck, that's a bad meme.

18:31.600 --> 18:32.400
Memes are bad.

18:32.400 --> 18:33.760
Don't meme everybody, fuck.

18:33.760 --> 18:36.160
This was a meme before memes even memed.

18:36.160 --> 18:36.800
It doesn't matter.

18:36.800 --> 18:38.880
It's still the same shit of just like,

18:38.880 --> 18:40.560
a joke isn't fucking funny.

18:40.560 --> 18:42.400
The trillionth time is told.

18:42.400 --> 18:43.600
And that's all memes are.

18:43.600 --> 18:45.440
They're just jokes that you tell trillionth time,

18:45.440 --> 18:46.640
except for a success kid.

18:46.640 --> 18:47.600
That's a good one.

18:47.600 --> 18:49.680
But all the other ones are like, fucking, what are you?

18:49.680 --> 18:50.880
That's not even good.

18:52.480 --> 18:53.280
What they ate my balls.

18:53.280 --> 18:55.120
Justin, just, Griffin, just to be fair,

18:55.120 --> 18:56.480
like that is what a joke is.

18:56.480 --> 18:57.920
You know that, like those joke books

18:57.920 --> 19:00.240
that are like knock knock jokes and shit.

19:00.240 --> 19:01.440
That's just old memes.

19:02.480 --> 19:05.680
Yeah, but memes, I think memes tend to,

19:05.680 --> 19:07.760
at least in the way it's being used here,

19:07.760 --> 19:10.720
what they do is they take a familiarity

19:11.360 --> 19:14.960
and they confuse familiarity and repetition

19:14.960 --> 19:18.720
with actual like humor or a joke.

19:18.720 --> 19:20.640
Like there's not actually a joke.

19:20.640 --> 19:23.280
It's just sort of like you've seen it enough times

19:23.280 --> 19:25.440
that it's a laugh of recognition.

19:25.440 --> 19:27.680
Like when you've been away for a while

19:27.680 --> 19:29.360
and you see your house and you laugh

19:29.920 --> 19:31.440
because you recognize that that's where you live.

19:31.440 --> 19:32.800
And it kind of looks like a face.

19:32.800 --> 19:34.720
Yeah, it's like the doors of mouth

19:34.720 --> 19:35.840
and what's going on here.

19:37.120 --> 19:38.960
And he's gonna eat you when you walk inside

19:38.960 --> 19:40.240
and you gobble up your luggage.

19:40.240 --> 19:42.240
And your house, as you step inside,

19:42.240 --> 19:45.040
your house is like, I'm gonna eat your balls.

19:45.040 --> 19:46.800
It's like, I love that house.

19:46.800 --> 19:50.800
Guys, I just wanna tell you that this past 10 day

19:50.800 --> 19:52.160
has been pretty great for me

19:52.160 --> 19:54.000
vis-a-vis like turning into a giant ball of light.

19:54.560 --> 19:57.440
The best thing that's maybe ever happened to me in my life

19:57.440 --> 20:00.160
is I'm on the checkout page for Dave Barry in cyberspace.

20:00.160 --> 20:02.480
And there's a little window here that says,

20:02.480 --> 20:04.960
why wait until January 20th, 2016?

20:04.960 --> 20:06.720
The expected arrival date

20:06.720 --> 20:09.680
of Dave Barry's in cyberspace to my house.

20:09.680 --> 20:12.240
And it says, read the beginning of this book for free.

20:12.240 --> 20:13.440
Start reading button.

20:13.440 --> 20:14.320
Clicking it now.

20:14.320 --> 20:15.440
Processing my request.

20:17.600 --> 20:18.560
Request accepted.

20:23.120 --> 20:24.400
That's the sound of it downloading.

20:30.400 --> 20:31.360
I've broken it.

20:31.360 --> 20:33.280
I've broken the app.

20:33.280 --> 20:34.320
I can see the reviews.

20:35.040 --> 20:37.200
Library journal says hilariously imaginative.

20:38.480 --> 20:39.360
Nonstop humor.

20:39.360 --> 20:41.680
Whether you're a computer whiz or a computer nerd,

20:41.680 --> 20:43.360
this tongue-in-cheek guide to computing

20:43.360 --> 20:44.720
by best-selling humorist Dave Barry

20:44.720 --> 20:48.720
has enough bite, B-Y-T-E, fuck you in the neck,

20:48.720 --> 20:50.960
to keep you entertained, published weekly.

20:50.960 --> 20:52.400
And it spans from all the way

20:52.400 --> 20:54.400
from computer whiz to computer nerd?

20:55.120 --> 20:56.400
That's the same shit.

20:56.400 --> 20:59.600
Anyone in that wide spectrum will enjoy this book.

20:59.600 --> 21:02.000
So I'm not making this up.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.520
There's a page of reviews.

21:03.520 --> 21:06.160
There's a page of a table of contents.

21:06.160 --> 21:08.320
And then 63 blank pages.

21:09.200 --> 21:11.840
I think I've been bamboozled by Dave Barry again.

21:14.080 --> 21:15.760
How perfect that the web app

21:15.760 --> 21:17.440
for Dave Barry's web book doesn't work.

21:18.640 --> 21:19.600
Dark omens.

21:19.600 --> 21:20.880
Bad portents.

21:20.880 --> 21:22.400
You got me again, Barry.

21:23.440 --> 21:24.960
Class, classic Barry right there.

21:24.960 --> 21:26.160
That's Barry in a nutshell.

21:26.160 --> 21:29.440
This is like when I bought Dave Barry Teaches Driving,

21:30.160 --> 21:31.280
and it did not go well.

21:31.840 --> 21:33.040
I lost my license.

21:33.040 --> 21:34.480
At the moment you clicked by,

21:34.480 --> 21:37.520
his car careened into your home through your front door window.

21:37.520 --> 21:38.640
He's like, let's go, kid.

21:38.640 --> 21:39.920
It was hilarious.

21:39.920 --> 21:40.640
You're with me.

21:40.640 --> 21:41.680
God, that's funny, Dave.

21:42.720 --> 21:44.720
Some of the other big Ate My Ball sites

21:44.720 --> 21:46.400
were Chewbacca Ate My Balls,

21:46.400 --> 21:48.080
Neo from The Matrix Ate My Balls.

21:49.840 --> 21:52.880
I'm assuming all the characters from Wings Ate My Balls

21:52.880 --> 21:54.000
just because of the time.

21:54.000 --> 21:54.880
The time of it, yeah.

21:54.880 --> 21:56.320
The time of it, certainly.

21:56.880 --> 21:59.120
Two guys, a girl in a pizza place ate my balls.

21:59.120 --> 22:01.120
Kramer ate my balls, certainly.

22:03.280 --> 22:04.480
Kramer did eat my balls, though.

22:05.120 --> 22:06.160
That one's actually real.

22:07.200 --> 22:08.720
Guys, we've had a lot of fun today.

22:09.760 --> 22:11.360
I want to make this explicitly clear.

22:11.360 --> 22:13.280
Michael Richards did eat my balls.

22:15.040 --> 22:16.880
Why are you fucking laughing at that?

22:16.880 --> 22:18.400
Well, because now you're a being of light,

22:18.400 --> 22:19.920
you don't have to worry about it anymore.

22:19.920 --> 22:21.840
Yeah, I mean, it helped in the transformation, actually,

22:21.840 --> 22:25.840
like less, it was more aerodynamic as I sailed a million miles

22:25.840 --> 22:29.840
into the sky and burst into flames of delight.

22:29.840 --> 22:32.640
But still, in my earth form,

22:33.200 --> 22:37.600
when I was a being of disgusting flesh,

22:38.320 --> 22:40.880
Michael Richards ate my balls, though, for real, though.

22:41.680 --> 22:42.880
Excuse me, pardon me.

22:43.520 --> 22:48.720
This just in, I just invented the best game of all time.

22:48.720 --> 22:49.920
Are you ready?

22:49.920 --> 22:51.440
For the best game of all time,

22:51.440 --> 22:55.360
I'm going to read you captions from ate my balls sites,

22:55.360 --> 22:57.520
and you're going to tell me who ate my balls.

22:57.520 --> 22:59.120
Travis, are you ready to play?

22:59.120 --> 22:59.360
I am.

22:59.360 --> 23:00.480
This is a bad game.

23:00.480 --> 23:02.000
I can't believe this is a fucking meme.

23:02.000 --> 23:04.400
And now we're like, now we're a part of the machine.

23:06.240 --> 23:07.440
Meme machine?

23:07.440 --> 23:10.400
We're part of the ate my balls industrial complex.

23:10.400 --> 23:11.200
This sucks.

23:11.200 --> 23:12.400
I hate this podcast.

23:12.400 --> 23:12.960
All right, go.

23:14.160 --> 23:15.920
Your balls are the perfect drug.

23:19.360 --> 23:20.480
I'm the one without a soul.

23:20.480 --> 23:22.000
I'm the one who wants to eat your balls.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.120
These are all the same.

23:24.560 --> 23:25.760
These are all the same.

23:26.480 --> 23:27.520
I don't know.

23:28.080 --> 23:30.400
Michael Richards did say some of these things to me,

23:30.400 --> 23:32.000
but I don't think that's the right answer.

23:32.000 --> 23:33.840
Your balls are my perfect drug.

23:36.160 --> 23:38.240
I feel like it's a musician and I'm going to be kicking myself.

23:38.240 --> 23:40.480
You let me violate you and eat your balls.

23:43.920 --> 23:45.760
Hannibal Lecter ate my balls.

23:45.760 --> 23:48.320
Oh, Travis, it's Trent Reznor ate my balls.

23:48.320 --> 23:49.120
Oh.

23:49.120 --> 23:50.080
Fucking let me down again.

23:50.080 --> 23:51.360
I don't want to play this game anymore.

23:51.360 --> 23:54.240
I was going to say Kurt Cobain,

23:54.240 --> 23:55.040
but I didn't.

23:55.040 --> 23:56.640
I don't want to be disrespectful.

23:56.640 --> 23:57.120
Yeah.

23:57.120 --> 23:59.840
Next question, please, God, don't say eat my balls one more time

23:59.840 --> 24:01.120
or else I'll burn the podcast down

24:01.120 --> 24:02.080
with all three of us inside of it.

24:02.080 --> 24:04.800
Happy 20th birthday, ate my balls.

24:04.800 --> 24:09.200
You're a great meme in terms of the strict definition

24:09.200 --> 24:10.640
of that exact phrase.

24:10.640 --> 24:15.200
You really fulfill all the criteria.

24:15.200 --> 24:17.200
I work at a bank in a rich part of town.

24:17.200 --> 24:18.000
I'm new to the job.

24:18.000 --> 24:19.280
And when I asked for identification,

24:19.280 --> 24:20.240
I get lectured.

24:20.240 --> 24:22.000
You should know who I am.

24:22.000 --> 24:25.760
I've had an account here longer than you've been alive.

24:25.760 --> 24:27.840
I have a lot of money in this bank.

24:27.840 --> 24:30.480
Everyone else here knows me, et cetera.

24:31.360 --> 24:34.320
Brothers, how do I avoid losing my mind?

24:34.320 --> 24:36.560
That's from Pillarade in Pittsburgh.

24:38.320 --> 24:42.080
You take all the money out that they have in their account.

24:42.080 --> 24:45.520
You fucking wad it up and you throw it at their fucking face

24:45.520 --> 24:46.800
as hard as you can.

24:46.800 --> 24:48.480
Like, you know, when mobsters like make a point,

24:48.480 --> 24:50.160
they're like, yeah, here's your fucking money.

24:51.280 --> 24:52.880
That's the caliber I'm talking about.

24:52.880 --> 24:54.960
And I'm saying, take your disrespectful ass

24:54.960 --> 24:57.200
to the fucking fifth third around the corner.

24:57.200 --> 24:58.480
I'm sick of your shit.

24:59.200 --> 25:02.560
Can you imagine looking at, I was about to say a bank teller,

25:02.560 --> 25:05.920
but any human being ever and saying something

25:05.920 --> 25:08.560
along the lines of, you should know who I am.

25:12.000 --> 25:12.640
Do you know?

25:12.640 --> 25:14.800
Okay, but like, if you really want to know how

25:14.800 --> 25:17.120
to handle the situation, the answer is pity.

25:17.120 --> 25:19.440
Because if the thing you have to hang your head on

25:19.440 --> 25:22.800
in your twilight years is, well, hey, listen,

25:22.800 --> 25:25.040
at least the people at the bank know who I am,

25:25.040 --> 25:27.920
then you have gone terribly awry.

25:27.920 --> 25:29.600
Like the only time you're allowed to say,

25:29.600 --> 25:32.880
you should know who I am, is if like a wife or loved one

25:32.880 --> 25:35.840
has been struck on the head and can't remember your name.

25:35.840 --> 25:37.760
Only then, and maybe not even then.

25:37.760 --> 25:39.360
In like a nowhere man situation,

25:39.360 --> 25:40.880
if like all of a sudden you go to the bathroom,

25:40.880 --> 25:43.120
you come back and you're like, I've never had a husband.

25:43.120 --> 25:45.440
Like that's when you should know who I am.

25:45.440 --> 25:46.720
You should know who I am.

25:46.720 --> 25:47.760
Can I say something though?

25:48.560 --> 25:50.000
This is sick grift, isn't it?

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
If this is 2015, I would really think about

25:52.000 --> 25:52.880
getting back in the game.

25:52.880 --> 25:54.800
I would need some old age makeup put on

25:54.800 --> 25:57.440
by a convincing young cosmetics artist.

25:57.440 --> 25:58.480
You should know who I am.

25:58.480 --> 26:00.080
I'm Fifth Thirtington.

26:00.080 --> 26:03.760
I would roll up to the whatever Chase Bank.

26:03.760 --> 26:05.120
I'm Mark Chase.

26:06.480 --> 26:07.200
You know me.

26:07.200 --> 26:08.560
You know my style.

26:08.560 --> 26:09.920
I've been here for years.

26:09.920 --> 26:11.920
You should know my style.

26:11.920 --> 26:13.520
I live above the bank.

26:13.520 --> 26:14.880
I live above the bank.

26:14.880 --> 26:16.160
I've been here for years.

26:16.160 --> 26:19.440
You should know this style for this guy.

26:19.440 --> 26:22.160
I'm the old, old man who always drops off

26:22.160 --> 26:24.320
perfect stacks of unmarked bills.

26:24.960 --> 26:26.640
I need you to call back.

26:26.640 --> 26:29.760
I drop off nasty stacks all the time.

26:29.760 --> 26:30.240
I'm Mark Chase.

26:30.240 --> 26:32.160
My account number is two.

26:32.160 --> 26:34.960
You should know my style.

26:36.080 --> 26:37.840
Just go get my stacks.

26:37.840 --> 26:42.320
Go get my stacks please before you make me cry more.

26:42.320 --> 26:44.640
My stacks are like my children.

26:44.640 --> 26:47.040
Because I could never conceive.

26:47.040 --> 26:51.840
I couldn't conceive because Michael Richards ate my balls.

26:51.840 --> 26:52.720
Police!

26:52.720 --> 26:54.800
Please just get my money.

26:54.800 --> 26:56.800
Please give me my stacks.

26:56.800 --> 26:59.120
I'm so tired.

26:59.120 --> 27:01.280
I just want to die.

27:01.280 --> 27:04.720
These young men are keeping my nasty stacks from me.

27:04.720 --> 27:07.920
Well, this bank floor is so hard.

27:07.920 --> 27:10.160
It hurts to stand on it.

27:10.160 --> 27:12.640
Are these lollipops for everyone?

27:12.640 --> 27:15.840
I tried to fill out the proper withdrawal form,

27:15.840 --> 27:20.160
but the pin broke all my old fingers.

27:24.160 --> 27:27.200
I was here the day you were born in this bank.

27:33.280 --> 27:37.600
The cost of putting a skyrocket in the four nasty stacks.

27:37.600 --> 27:42.720
Your pep needs them.

27:42.720 --> 27:46.240
That's a perfect crime.

27:46.240 --> 27:48.880
Nobody in good conscience is going to turn you away.

27:48.880 --> 27:51.200
They would give you all the stacks they got on their shelf.

27:51.200 --> 27:55.360
If nothing else, just to make you stop whatever you're doing.

27:55.360 --> 27:56.960
Please don't cry.

27:56.960 --> 28:00.720
They would even know that you're a young person in old age makeup trying to rob the bank.

28:00.720 --> 28:01.680
That doesn't matter.

28:01.680 --> 28:02.960
They would be made so uncomfortable by you.

28:02.960 --> 28:03.920
You would leave and the manager would be like,

28:03.920 --> 28:08.560
did he just rob the bank? And they'd be like, well, he needed it more.

28:08.560 --> 28:09.760
It wasn't really a robbery.

28:09.760 --> 28:13.120
We just made a charitable donation to old man, young man Griffin.

28:13.120 --> 28:14.720
Yeah, he needed it.

28:14.720 --> 28:17.280
God, 20 grifteen, you ended too soon.

28:17.280 --> 28:21.280
Fuck, we're in January, January 18th, 18 days too late.

28:21.280 --> 28:22.960
We'll get it in 3015.

28:22.960 --> 28:24.320
The fucking heist of the century.

28:24.320 --> 28:25.120
Yeah, that's a good point.

28:25.840 --> 28:27.280
Not 2115?

28:27.280 --> 28:27.920
I guess.

28:29.280 --> 28:30.480
No, let's do 3015.

28:31.520 --> 28:32.880
Give us something to work towards.

28:32.880 --> 28:36.080
Bank of tech will probably be like pretty advanced at that point.

28:36.800 --> 28:40.880
They'll have like every bank teller wears special glasses that lets them see through

28:40.880 --> 28:41.760
old age makeup.

28:42.880 --> 28:48.480
After a rash of crimes in 2515 by my great, great grandkid who listens to the fucking

28:48.480 --> 28:54.240
archives of this podcast that they found buried under the soil of my basement.

28:54.240 --> 28:56.320
And they find this and like, oh fuck, this is a great crime.

28:56.320 --> 28:58.080
And then they do it and they're billionaires.

28:58.080 --> 28:59.840
God, my great, great grandkid is so cool.

28:59.840 --> 29:03.600
Too cool for us.

29:03.600 --> 29:07.600
I didn't quite math it out right because I don't think by 2515 I will be two generations

29:07.600 --> 29:08.000
down.

29:08.000 --> 29:09.040
That would be fucking crazy.

29:09.040 --> 29:09.520
You don't know.

29:10.240 --> 29:10.720
Yeah, I don't know.

29:10.720 --> 29:13.120
There's advances in medical technology every day.

29:13.120 --> 29:14.400
Yeah, it's getting wild out there.

29:14.960 --> 29:15.440
It is.

29:16.800 --> 29:18.320
Do you guys want to go to the money zone?

29:19.120 --> 29:21.440
Is that you saying like, should we go rob Chase Bank right now?

29:22.160 --> 29:22.960
Basically, yeah.

29:22.960 --> 29:24.400
It's the heist of the century.

29:24.400 --> 29:41.200
The 25th century, my brother, my brother, me is sponsored in part by nature box.com.

29:41.200 --> 29:42.960
I don't know if you're familiar with nature box.

29:43.840 --> 29:48.960
If you've never listened to a podcast before, but they have a hundred over 100 tasty options

29:48.960 --> 29:52.000
like sriracha, roasted cashews and French toast, granola.

29:52.000 --> 29:59.680
I've been really into they have a plantains type vibe that I can get into pretty deeply.

30:00.800 --> 30:05.360
They also have Parmesan garlic pop pops, which I just got a thing.

30:05.360 --> 30:09.520
I just got a thing called peanut butter, Graham and jam trail mix.

30:09.520 --> 30:10.960
What the fuck does that even mean?

30:10.960 --> 30:13.360
It's just a big bag of sloppy jam.

30:13.360 --> 30:18.320
It's graham crackers covered in peanut butter with like, you know, berries and nuts and

30:18.320 --> 30:19.760
it's like the best.

30:19.760 --> 30:21.120
But no loose jam.

30:21.120 --> 30:22.320
No loose jam.

30:22.320 --> 30:22.960
Okay.

30:22.960 --> 30:25.920
That's actually a guarantee they give you before you order anything in nature box.

30:25.920 --> 30:26.720
No loose jam.

30:26.720 --> 30:27.680
No loose jam.

30:27.680 --> 30:30.240
You're not just going to open a bag and a bunch of jam is going to fucking fall out.

30:30.240 --> 30:30.560
We're nature box.

30:30.560 --> 30:33.120
No loose jam accidents since 2014.

30:35.280 --> 30:40.800
They've got a ton of like really great snacks for you to enjoy and they deliver right to

30:40.800 --> 30:44.560
your door and you could try them, mix it up every month, get new snacks.

30:45.840 --> 30:47.360
You can get your first box right now.

30:47.360 --> 30:53.440
You go to naturebox.com and unlock a world of taste and possibility.

30:53.440 --> 30:53.840
That's right.

30:53.840 --> 30:57.760
Still the best, still the best marketing writing probably in existence.

30:58.320 --> 31:02.480
Oh, your, your, your fingers are the key to, well, your keyboard's the key.

31:02.480 --> 31:03.600
Your computer's the key.

31:03.600 --> 31:06.880
Go to naturebox.com and then open the door to the world of taste and possibility.

31:06.880 --> 31:10.960
If you want to improve your style, it can be a little daunting if it's not something

31:10.960 --> 31:12.320
that you're intimately familiar with.

31:12.320 --> 31:17.920
You don't have the time to read Jesse Thorn's, uh, Japanese style fashion magazines that

31:17.920 --> 31:18.640
he enjoys.

31:18.640 --> 31:21.600
Like he reads voraciously to keep up on the latest trends.

31:21.600 --> 31:22.720
It's impossible.

31:22.720 --> 31:25.600
So, uh, let me recommend to you trunk club.

31:25.600 --> 31:26.240
Okay.

31:26.240 --> 31:29.920
You go to trunkclub.com slash my brother and you're going to answer some simple questions

31:29.920 --> 31:34.480
about your style, your preferences, your size, uh, and you're assigned an expert stylist

31:34.480 --> 31:38.480
that is going to hand pick clothes for you from the best brands.

31:38.480 --> 31:41.520
You just approve the stuff you like and you send back what you don't.

31:41.520 --> 31:43.920
You're only charged for the stuff that you want and you want to keep.

31:43.920 --> 31:47.840
You get to try it all on, uh, it comes in a big, cool trunk and the stuff you don't

31:47.840 --> 31:51.440
want, you got a prepaid trunk to send it back to them.

31:51.440 --> 31:52.240
And you know what's crazy?

31:52.240 --> 31:56.400
When you say the thing about the, um, the stylist, like I was anticipating I would get

31:56.400 --> 31:58.240
like, you know, a little chat window pop up.

31:58.240 --> 32:00.800
A little fucking dress, dressed up, clippy.

32:00.800 --> 32:05.840
Well, just like a, and it was like, is this a real person or is it, I got a call from

32:05.840 --> 32:08.000
my stylist, Brooke, and she's like, hi Travis.

32:08.000 --> 32:09.520
And I was like, oh, hi Brooke.

32:09.520 --> 32:10.800
And we talked about sweaters.

32:10.800 --> 32:14.880
See, I think I would actually, you know how much I love talking to strangers.

32:14.880 --> 32:17.360
I think I would actually prefer a little clippy that popped up and be like,

32:17.360 --> 32:18.960
hmm, suspenders with a belt, huh?

32:18.960 --> 32:20.560
Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.

32:20.560 --> 32:24.480
Well, when Brooke dropped the bomb on me that there's like a trunk club store I can go

32:24.480 --> 32:27.520
to in town that has an open bar, like what?

32:27.520 --> 32:28.160
Okay.

32:28.160 --> 32:29.280
Yeah, I'm there.

32:29.280 --> 32:35.040
Um, so, uh, in, in anyway, uh, you're going to want to go to trunkclub.com slash my brother.

32:35.040 --> 32:36.320
Remember free shipping both ways.

32:36.320 --> 32:40.960
You'll keep the stuff you like, uh, and it's a really great, great, great experiences.

32:40.960 --> 32:45.120
Those stores that Travis mentioned are also in LA, Chicago, Dallas, DC, and New York City,

32:45.120 --> 32:47.920
where you can meet your personal stylist right in front of them.

32:47.920 --> 32:52.720
So again, right now, go to trunkclub.com slash my brother and get your look right.

32:52.720 --> 32:56.400
I want to talk about me undies, me undies, changing the game, wearing them right now,

32:56.400 --> 32:59.040
keeping me fresh, keeping me dry, uh, but not too dry.

32:59.040 --> 33:00.560
I am also wearing me undies.

33:00.560 --> 33:01.040
Oh, nice.

33:01.040 --> 33:04.480
So I just, I'm going to start assuming that all three of us are constantly wearing me undies.

33:04.480 --> 33:06.400
Uh, they're, they're, they're really wonderful.

33:07.200 --> 33:11.360
Listen, Valentine's day is coming up and, and if you want to get your, you know,

33:11.360 --> 33:16.720
zone between your legs and your tummy looking very, very good, I would suggest maybe turning

33:16.720 --> 33:19.200
to me undies for the perfect solution for that.

33:19.200 --> 33:20.240
They're really comfy.

33:20.240 --> 33:23.360
They're made of micromodal fabric, meaning they're twice as soft as cotton.

33:23.360 --> 33:24.880
Fuck cotton for real though.

33:24.880 --> 33:26.560
Me undies, they don't just feel great.

33:26.560 --> 33:27.600
They look really great.

33:27.600 --> 33:31.120
They come in tons of cool prints and styles and new designs come out every month.

33:31.120 --> 33:34.480
And for men and women, you could get a matching set for Valentine's day.

33:34.480 --> 33:35.600
They got this really cute set.

33:35.600 --> 33:40.080
That's like red with white polka dots and you and your significant other could have

33:40.080 --> 33:41.920
like matching genital sheaths.

33:41.920 --> 33:43.600
I'm like, yeah, go for it.

33:43.600 --> 33:48.720
February has a special limited edition design from the legendary artist, Keith Haring.

33:48.720 --> 33:51.760
And it's, it's a retro design and it's inspired by love.

33:52.560 --> 33:55.840
Just like me and the three of us always inspired by love.

33:55.840 --> 33:57.280
It's a great Valentine's day gift.

33:57.280 --> 33:57.840
Think about it.

33:58.400 --> 33:59.760
That's how we do our thing.

33:59.760 --> 34:00.880
That's how we do our thing.

34:00.880 --> 34:02.880
Uh, you can win Valentine's day this year.

34:02.880 --> 34:07.440

34:20.000 --> 34:24.080

34:24.080 --> 34:28.560
Me undies, dedicated to providing the world's most comfortable underwears.

34:28.560 --> 34:32.080
Uh, we also have a message for Brittany from Marshall.

34:32.080 --> 34:34.800
Happy, happy, happy birthday, Britt.

34:34.800 --> 34:37.920
You are so amazing and deserve the world.

34:37.920 --> 34:38.640
Sure show.

34:39.600 --> 34:44.480
Now I think that's just XOXO, but I do appreciate you trying to read it as though it were like

34:44.480 --> 34:45.280
Mandarin.

34:45.280 --> 34:47.040
I read what's on the page, Griffin.

34:47.040 --> 34:51.440
You know what, what I really liked that Marshall had more words in this, but he knew he had

34:51.440 --> 34:51.920
crushed it.

34:52.480 --> 34:52.800
Yeah.

34:52.800 --> 34:56.160
This was probably like draft number five and he was just like, you know what?

34:56.160 --> 34:57.200
Simplify, simplify.

34:57.200 --> 34:58.960
Gravity is the soul of wit.

34:58.960 --> 35:00.400
That's something I come up with.

35:00.400 --> 35:01.520
I'm gonna say happy three times.

35:02.400 --> 35:05.600
Birthday to acknowledge exactly what the day is.

35:05.600 --> 35:07.680
And then the name of the person the message is for.

35:07.680 --> 35:09.120
And then a sentence of nice things.

35:09.120 --> 35:10.160
And then some Mandarin.

35:10.160 --> 35:11.520
A Mandarin proverb that means.

35:11.520 --> 35:12.080
Show show.

35:12.080 --> 35:14.000
That means I love you so much, Brittany.

35:14.800 --> 35:18.720
It's weird that there's a Mandarin proverb that says I love you so much, Brittany, but.

35:18.720 --> 35:20.400
And it's only four characters long.

35:20.400 --> 35:21.680
That's the weirder part.

35:21.680 --> 35:21.920
Yeah.

35:21.920 --> 35:24.400
It's just XOXO means that in Mandarin, but.

35:24.400 --> 35:25.920
Yeah, well, it's an efficient language.

35:25.920 --> 35:27.760
So it's a mysterious language.

35:27.760 --> 35:29.920
I got a message for James Donaldson.

35:29.920 --> 35:34.720
And this is from Susan, Phil, Drew, Ali and Greg.

35:34.720 --> 35:35.920
They say James.

35:37.200 --> 35:41.360
They used some of their characters about four on S's, which is fine.

35:41.360 --> 35:42.720
That's their money.

35:42.720 --> 35:48.960
You fascinate us with your tiny pencils, snazzy style, design skills with a Z and disturbing

35:48.960 --> 35:50.400
knowledge of fonts and comics.

35:50.400 --> 35:56.400
You're a coolest, least moist, non crevice guy who still can't pronounce the word ambulance.

35:57.040 --> 35:58.560
So happy birthday.

35:58.560 --> 35:59.280
You're awesome.

35:59.280 --> 36:00.160
And we heart you.

36:00.720 --> 36:04.880
You deserve greatness, business cards and this greeting for the McElroy brothers.

36:04.880 --> 36:05.760
How do you mispronounce?

36:05.760 --> 36:07.360
You think it's like ambulance?

36:07.360 --> 36:09.600
Maybe he's fucking Jeffy from the Family Circus.

36:09.600 --> 36:11.360
Ambulance.

36:11.360 --> 36:13.840
There's a lot of talking in here about comics.

36:13.840 --> 36:15.280
So maybe he was a comic.

36:16.240 --> 36:17.920
Specifically, Jeffy from Family Circus.

36:17.920 --> 36:20.960
He grew up, came out of the comic like Aha's Take On Me.

36:22.080 --> 36:26.400
And he fucking became a comic artist himself because it's like all he knew.

36:26.400 --> 36:30.480
But the only problem is if he tries to say spaghetti, it does, of course, come out paschetti.

36:30.480 --> 36:32.720
And when he says ambulance, it comes out mandolins.

36:33.360 --> 36:38.000
Now, would Cool World be a more topical reference than Aha's Take On Me?

36:38.560 --> 36:41.920
No, because in Cool World, the man went into the cartoon, right?

36:41.920 --> 36:43.760
But then a cartoon did come out.

36:43.760 --> 36:44.640
I forget.

36:44.640 --> 36:46.320
And then that cartoon ate my balls.

36:46.320 --> 36:48.240
Oh, boy.

36:48.240 --> 36:48.640
Oh, boy.

36:50.640 --> 36:55.440
Actually, if you eat your balls while in toon form, it does trap you in toon form forever.

36:55.440 --> 36:56.400
You die in real life.

36:56.400 --> 36:57.360
Hi, I'm Brian Safi.

36:57.360 --> 36:58.160
And I'm Erin Gibson.

36:58.160 --> 37:00.400
And we host the Throwing Shade podcast.

37:00.400 --> 37:04.240
On Throwing Shade, we look at an issue important to ladies and an issue important to gay people.

37:04.240 --> 37:05.680
And then we basically make fun of it.

37:05.680 --> 37:05.920
Yeah.

37:05.920 --> 37:08.880
And just to answer your question, no, we don't have a marriage pact.

37:08.880 --> 37:12.240
But if we don't get married by the time we're 30, we're going to do that with each other.

37:12.240 --> 37:13.120
No, that's true.

37:13.120 --> 37:20.000
Although we have each been divorced three times.

37:20.000 --> 37:20.880
You guys want a Yahoo?

37:21.440 --> 37:22.160
Yes.

37:22.160 --> 37:23.280
Yes.

37:23.280 --> 37:23.840
Bring it.

37:23.840 --> 37:25.600
This Yahoo was sent in by Joel.

37:25.600 --> 37:25.920
OK.

37:28.240 --> 37:29.200
Joel Davis.

37:29.200 --> 37:31.840
Joel Davis.

37:31.840 --> 37:33.360
All right, Joel Davis sent this one in.

37:33.360 --> 37:37.680
It's by Yahoo Answers user Kenneth, who asks, what's the frequency?

37:39.520 --> 37:40.320
Fuck you.

37:40.320 --> 37:40.820
Come on.

37:40.820 --> 37:43.300
I love it.

37:43.300 --> 37:44.820
Don't ever stop.

37:44.820 --> 37:47.540
Kenneth started his account on January 9, 2016.

37:47.540 --> 37:50.260
I think he started his account to ask this urgent question.

37:50.260 --> 37:52.340
And it is a fucking urgent one.

37:52.340 --> 37:54.980
And frankly, we are now nine days behind the eight ball.

37:55.700 --> 37:59.620
Kenneth asks, what should I do about this coyote my kids have been feeding?

38:00.660 --> 38:00.900
What?

38:02.420 --> 38:04.260
So I have two terrible sons.

38:04.260 --> 38:04.980
I added terrible.

38:05.780 --> 38:06.740
I added terrible.

38:06.740 --> 38:09.700
That's a bit of editorializing on my part.

38:09.700 --> 38:11.220
And bliss to light.

38:11.220 --> 38:12.980
But it's true.

38:12.980 --> 38:16.260
I have two terrible sons age 11 and 9.

38:16.260 --> 38:21.060
I just learned about two weeks ago that they have been feeding a wild coyote that lives

38:21.060 --> 38:25.220
in the ground underneath a large flat rock in the woods near our house.

38:25.220 --> 38:26.820
He, in fact, seems quite friendly.

38:27.700 --> 38:29.460
My boys introduced me to him.

38:29.460 --> 38:29.960
Dad.

38:31.300 --> 38:32.740
This is Kyle.

38:34.420 --> 38:35.460
He's our new dad.

38:35.460 --> 38:37.140
My terrible boys introduced me to him.

38:37.140 --> 38:39.860
He even responds to their call and comes to get food.

38:39.860 --> 38:42.820
However, I wasn't comfortable with them interacting with him like that.

38:42.820 --> 38:46.340
And I told them they couldn't feed him or go near him anymore as soon as they showed

38:46.340 --> 38:47.220
him to me.

38:47.220 --> 38:49.540
We are having quite a cold winter in Minnesota.

38:49.540 --> 38:52.580
And in the past weeks, my terrible boys haven't been feeding him.

38:52.580 --> 38:54.980
He has begun lingering in or near our yard.

38:54.980 --> 38:57.380
He absolutely appears to be starving to death.

38:57.380 --> 38:59.540
We will see him wheezing and growling outside.

38:59.540 --> 39:03.860
Then a couple nights ago, my terrible boys decided to leave a carton of eggs and a two

39:03.860 --> 39:07.780
pound bag of cheddar cheese on our porch because they want to give Kyle diarrhea forever.

39:08.820 --> 39:10.740
They wanted him to make an omelet.

39:10.740 --> 39:12.820
Which you can imagine he loved.

39:12.820 --> 39:14.820
He did seem to go away for a couple of days.

39:14.820 --> 39:15.620
Then yesterday-

39:15.620 --> 39:16.740
While shitting himself.

39:16.740 --> 39:20.820
Then yesterday, he got very aggressive with my wife, scaring her quite a bit and tearing

39:20.820 --> 39:22.260
her insulated leggings.

39:22.260 --> 39:23.620
I feel bad for the coyote.

39:23.620 --> 39:24.120
What?

39:24.580 --> 39:28.420
I feel bad for the coyote because it seems like he became reliant on the food from my

39:28.420 --> 39:30.020
terrible sons during the winter.

39:30.020 --> 39:34.900
And now he's in a situation where he didn't move to a location when he should have.

39:34.900 --> 39:36.980
But I can't have a coyote attacking my family.

39:36.980 --> 39:38.820
If I have to shoot him, I will do it.

39:38.820 --> 39:39.780
But it feels wrong.

39:39.780 --> 39:44.580
And it doesn't help that my terrible sons had given him a name, Kyle, and grown attached.

39:44.580 --> 39:45.460
What should I do?

39:45.460 --> 39:47.060
I added a lot of words to that question.

39:47.060 --> 39:50.660
And normally I try to just preserve the work as it is in its native state.

39:50.660 --> 39:53.060
But boy, when the shoe fits, wear it.

39:53.620 --> 39:57.700
Can we all agree that at this point, coyote Kyle is trying to replace human Kenneth?

39:57.700 --> 40:01.540
As the new, as coyote dad?

40:01.540 --> 40:03.140
As coyote dad.

40:03.140 --> 40:06.100
Like he approached the wife the only way he knows how.

40:06.100 --> 40:08.740
He's been courting the two sons.

40:08.740 --> 40:12.740
This is like that movie Daddy's Home, except with a coyote.

40:12.740 --> 40:16.660
Or the movie Jack Frost, where Michael Keaton dies and becomes a snowman.

40:17.460 --> 40:19.540
Kenneth, I guess he hasn't died yet, has he?

40:19.540 --> 40:22.420
Well, he will if this coyote has his way.

40:22.420 --> 40:24.100
I'll shoot him if he doesn't shoot me first.

40:24.100 --> 40:28.980
It's basically exactly Octodad, except it's an octopus.

40:28.980 --> 40:30.020
It's a coyote.

40:30.020 --> 40:33.780
And instead of hilarious adventures, he eats everybody.

40:33.780 --> 40:34.980
He eats all of them.

40:34.980 --> 40:35.860
And he eats them.

40:35.860 --> 40:36.980
And it takes 30 seconds.

40:36.980 --> 40:40.020
It's a very short game in which you eat your whole family.

40:40.020 --> 40:41.140
Here's a movie idea.

40:41.700 --> 40:44.500
And it's about a coyote that wants to be the dad of a family.

40:44.500 --> 40:45.860
But there's already a dad.

40:45.860 --> 40:47.300
And this makes the coyote very sad.

40:47.300 --> 40:48.340
And it's starving to death.

40:48.340 --> 40:52.820
And the coyote is voiced by who's hot?

40:52.820 --> 40:54.420
Who do people like love just hearing that?

40:54.420 --> 40:55.140
Channing Tatum?

40:55.140 --> 40:55.860
No, no, no, no.

40:57.060 --> 41:00.020
The late night host guy, the British late night host guy

41:00.020 --> 41:01.460
that was on that Doctor Who episode.

41:01.460 --> 41:02.100
And he was sent into the woods.

41:02.100 --> 41:02.740
James Corden.

41:02.740 --> 41:04.340
James Corden?

41:04.340 --> 41:04.980
Corden.

41:04.980 --> 41:07.540
James Corden plays Kyle, the coyote.

41:07.540 --> 41:15.380
A coyote who befriends two children, but their dick dad scares Kyle away.

41:15.380 --> 41:16.100
And he goes in the woods.

41:16.100 --> 41:17.060
And he's starving to death.

41:17.060 --> 41:18.660
But a fucking fairy comes to him.

41:18.660 --> 41:21.220
The guardian of the forest comes to him and says,

41:21.220 --> 41:22.980
Kyle, I'll grant you one wish, and he says,

41:22.980 --> 41:24.660
I just want to be the dad of this family.

41:24.660 --> 41:27.380
And then the fairy bestows upon Kyle the power to go in

41:27.380 --> 41:29.140
and eat this dad wholesale.

41:29.140 --> 41:30.580
Just eat the dad wholesale.

41:30.580 --> 41:32.980
But it's fine because he's the villain in the story

41:32.980 --> 41:34.100
and everybody loves Kyle.

41:34.100 --> 41:36.260
And then Kyle gets to be the dad of the family.

41:36.260 --> 41:37.140
Sold.

41:37.140 --> 41:38.020
But you are rooting.

41:38.020 --> 41:39.700
Again, I have to state this.

41:39.700 --> 41:41.940
You are rooting for Kyle because he's voiced

41:41.940 --> 41:44.500
by a very affable James Corden.

41:44.500 --> 41:45.700
Coming soon for Pixar.

41:45.700 --> 41:46.900
Coming soon for Pixar.

41:46.900 --> 41:47.860
Coyote Dad.

41:47.860 --> 41:48.740
Coyote Get My Dad.

41:48.740 --> 41:51.940
Coyote Get My Dad, dot, dot, dot.

41:51.940 --> 41:53.780
But it's OK because he was an asshole.

41:54.420 --> 41:56.340
I really wish I could have been there on the day

41:56.340 --> 42:00.740
that the other coyotes went to warmer climes.

42:00.740 --> 42:02.900
And Kyle's like, nah, nah, nah.

42:02.900 --> 42:05.700
I got a fucking pretty dozen eggs waiting for me, bro.

42:05.700 --> 42:08.980
I got it completely, completely set up here.

42:08.980 --> 42:10.900
Do you have cheese at your warmer locale?

42:10.900 --> 42:12.100
No, I didn't think so.

42:12.100 --> 42:14.020
Guys, Bryce and Derek, they got me.

42:14.020 --> 42:16.020
They are my bone thugs for life.

42:16.020 --> 42:17.700
They got me.

42:17.700 --> 42:19.700
They introduced me to their dad.

42:19.700 --> 42:20.820
We're tied.

42:20.820 --> 42:21.700
Stacks on stacks.

42:21.700 --> 42:23.380
I want to be there at the introduction.

42:24.100 --> 42:27.700
Kyle, Kenneth, Kenneth, Kyle, pleasure to meet you, sir.

42:27.700 --> 42:29.380
Please don't come around my kids anymore.

42:29.380 --> 42:30.100
What?

42:30.100 --> 42:30.900
What?

42:30.900 --> 42:33.460
Crazy about these boys, but Kenneth,

42:33.460 --> 42:34.740
he left me a little cold.

42:37.140 --> 42:39.140
One out of five would not meet again.

42:39.140 --> 42:40.180
Would not dad again.

42:40.740 --> 42:42.740
Kenneth, you say you want me to stay away from your sons,

42:42.740 --> 42:45.540
but how are, do you know another way for coyotes

42:45.540 --> 42:46.340
to get Dunkaroos?

42:47.060 --> 42:50.980
Do you know of another way I met that I'm unfamiliar with?

42:50.980 --> 42:51.860
This is the twist.

42:52.420 --> 42:54.900
Asshole Kenneth doesn't want the kids to be around Kyle,

42:54.900 --> 42:56.900
but he's also not there for the kids.

42:56.900 --> 42:59.540
But Coyote Kyle is going to teach Asshole Kenneth

42:59.540 --> 43:02.260
how to be a better dad when he drags him in the woods

43:02.260 --> 43:04.660
and keeps him in the woods for a couple of days.

43:04.660 --> 43:07.460
He's like, I'll show you how I interact with my family, Kenneth.

43:08.180 --> 43:09.140
And what does that entail?

43:10.020 --> 43:12.420
Just killing rabbits and bringing them home?

43:12.420 --> 43:17.620
Killing fowl and dragging rabbits back for his kids.

43:17.620 --> 43:18.980
And then Kenneth is like,

43:18.980 --> 43:21.140
I've never killed a rabbit for my kids.

43:21.140 --> 43:22.260
Kyle, you're the better dad.

43:22.260 --> 43:23.620
I've got to go on, I don't know,

43:23.620 --> 43:26.260
some kind of spiritual hike for several months.

43:26.260 --> 43:28.340
Please don't eat my wife while I'm gone.

43:28.340 --> 43:32.260
Do you think this is how that Revenant movie started

43:32.900 --> 43:34.660
when they were like blue sky in it?

43:34.660 --> 43:35.700
Is that what the film is called?

43:36.420 --> 43:36.740
Yes.

43:38.500 --> 43:40.020
I think it's called That Revenant Movie.

43:40.020 --> 43:44.500
That Revenant Movie and that Nosferatu did,

43:44.500 --> 43:50.180
and the original idea for the flick

43:50.180 --> 43:52.740
was a dad who befriends a coyote

43:52.740 --> 43:53.860
and he learns to be a better dad.

43:53.860 --> 43:54.980
And then at the end of the movie, of course,

43:54.980 --> 43:58.020
he has to kill the coyote just because nature,

43:58.020 --> 44:01.700
and then it says something about how humanity abuses nature.

44:01.700 --> 44:03.860
I'm still working on what the imaginary pitch would be,

44:03.860 --> 44:04.820
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

44:04.820 --> 44:06.580
Man versus nature versus eggs.

44:06.580 --> 44:07.780
Then Leo rolled up and he's like,

44:07.780 --> 44:10.820
they are not going to give me the Oscar for this.

44:10.820 --> 44:12.580
They are not going to give me the Oscar for this.

44:12.580 --> 44:13.540
Make it a bear.

44:13.540 --> 44:14.260
Make it a bear.

44:14.980 --> 44:15.860
Step one.

44:15.860 --> 44:18.420
Step one, get rid of the talking of the bear.

44:18.420 --> 44:19.940
That's not going to do it for me.

44:19.940 --> 44:20.340
I have to be on it.

44:20.340 --> 44:22.180
I kill the bear in scene two.

44:22.180 --> 44:23.700
I adopt its cubs.

44:23.700 --> 44:25.060
Now I am the bear.

44:25.060 --> 44:26.340
This is better.

44:26.900 --> 44:27.400
Fuck.

44:28.020 --> 44:30.020
Guys, why aren't we making movies?

44:30.020 --> 44:31.940
Being a bear dad is Oscar bait.

44:31.940 --> 44:33.060
Everyone knows that.

44:33.060 --> 44:33.380
Yeah.

44:33.380 --> 44:40.420
And being a dad named Oscar is bear bait.

44:40.420 --> 44:41.140
Shit.

44:41.140 --> 44:41.700
Science.

44:41.700 --> 44:44.340
How many fucking hearts of the ocean

44:44.340 --> 44:47.540
do the three of us fucking manufacture every episode

44:47.540 --> 44:49.860
that we then just like toss into the furnace saying like,

44:49.860 --> 44:50.740
ah, good joke.

44:50.740 --> 44:51.620
Bye, good idea.

44:51.620 --> 44:52.980
Into the furnace with you.

44:52.980 --> 44:54.900
And if we actually followed through with our fucking dreams

44:54.900 --> 44:58.420
for once, we would be the most successful entertainers

44:58.420 --> 45:00.020
in the world.

45:00.020 --> 45:00.260
Yeah.

45:00.260 --> 45:04.180
Coyote Dad coming to screens near you 2018.

45:04.180 --> 45:05.460
Maybe this is the time.

45:05.460 --> 45:07.860
Is this the one that we finally just buckle down

45:07.860 --> 45:08.740
and get it done?

45:08.740 --> 45:10.900
Well, we have to come with a better name than Coyote Dad.

45:10.900 --> 45:11.380
All the other stuff.

45:11.380 --> 45:12.580
Coyote Dad the musical.

45:12.580 --> 45:13.620
Dad Coyote Dad.

45:14.820 --> 45:15.700
Coyote Ugly.

45:16.900 --> 45:19.220
What about, why don't we just call it Kyle?

45:19.220 --> 45:20.660
Like if they can call a movie Carol,

45:20.660 --> 45:21.540
and it's like, what's it about?

45:21.540 --> 45:22.900
It's like, don't worry about it.

45:23.460 --> 45:25.300
I don't see why we can't just call our movie.

45:25.300 --> 45:27.380
Yeah, I don't see why I can't name our movie Kyle.

45:27.380 --> 45:29.300
And then we know at least one thing,

45:29.300 --> 45:30.980
every Kyle in the world is gonna go see it.

45:30.980 --> 45:32.980
And that's what, like 300,000 people?

45:33.620 --> 45:35.220
Finally, a movie for me.

45:35.220 --> 45:36.580
Yeah, they will say, and then they'll show up.

45:36.580 --> 45:38.820
And it'll actually be a story about like being a good dad

45:38.820 --> 45:40.180
and a good human, more importantly.

45:40.180 --> 45:41.140
And a good Kyle.

45:41.140 --> 45:43.700
And a good, well, yes.

45:43.700 --> 45:45.380
A good human, a great Kyle.

45:47.300 --> 45:48.020
That's the timeline.

45:48.020 --> 45:49.300
An okay coyote.

45:50.020 --> 45:52.740
Okay Coyote, the world's premier coyote dating site.

45:54.980 --> 45:55.940
Right next to it, right next to it.

45:55.940 --> 45:57.940
But where's all the coyotes in this bar?

45:57.940 --> 45:59.700
They're all online, chum.

45:59.700 --> 46:02.980
Okay Coyote is the second most popular coyote website

46:02.980 --> 46:04.660
in the world, right behind Dad Yelp,

46:04.660 --> 46:07.220
which is where coyotes leave reviews of dads

46:07.220 --> 46:09.140
for other coyotes to read.

46:09.140 --> 46:10.180
And also hook up.

46:12.740 --> 46:14.740
I met my wife on Dad Yelp.

46:14.740 --> 46:15.460
Kenneth, what's wrong?

46:15.460 --> 46:16.740
You're crying in front of your computer.

46:16.740 --> 46:18.820
Yeah, just logged on to Dad Yelp.

46:18.820 --> 46:24.100
And that coyote that our terrible sons have befriended,

46:24.100 --> 46:28.500
he has left some, frankly, some pretty wretched comments about me on here.

46:29.700 --> 46:31.140
I think I have to kill Kyle.

46:32.740 --> 46:34.820
I just want everyone to know that it's just occurred to me

46:34.820 --> 46:38.740
that when I picture Kyle underneath a rock out in the woods,

46:38.740 --> 46:41.860
I'm kind of picturing that shadow wolf from Neverending Story.

46:41.860 --> 46:42.260
Okay.

46:42.260 --> 46:43.940
Who's like the voice of the nothing.

46:43.940 --> 46:44.500
Yeah, sure.

46:45.060 --> 46:48.980
That's how I'm picturing Kyle, but still more charming than Kenneth.

46:48.980 --> 46:50.580
Yeah, fuck Kenneth for real though.

46:50.580 --> 46:53.780
Do you know how bad of a dad you have to be before your kids are like,

46:53.780 --> 46:55.780
here's our new dad, a coyote.

46:55.780 --> 46:56.580
A coyote?

46:56.580 --> 46:57.220
He'll do.

46:57.220 --> 46:59.300
He ate mom's insulated leggings.

46:59.300 --> 47:03.460
Yeah, he ate our mom's insulin and he's our new dad and we love him.

47:03.460 --> 47:03.940
What?

47:03.940 --> 47:06.180
How bad is your real dad?

47:06.180 --> 47:09.460
I do want to just shout out to my girl Amanda on Yahoo.

47:10.900 --> 47:12.500
17% best answers, not bad.

47:13.300 --> 47:15.940
Who says, call a zoo and ask for advice.

47:15.940 --> 47:18.660
Animal control will probably just result to violence.

47:18.660 --> 47:19.620
Pretty cool.

47:19.620 --> 47:20.900
Hi, zoo.

47:20.900 --> 47:22.260
Do you guys eat any coyotes?

47:22.260 --> 47:24.820
I've got a free coyote here.

47:24.820 --> 47:25.700
I've got a free coyote.

47:25.700 --> 47:26.740
Like you've captured one?

47:26.740 --> 47:28.500
Like I guess we could open up a coyote exhibit.

47:28.500 --> 47:31.380
No, I don't have it under, I don't like have it in hand.

47:31.380 --> 47:34.660
You guys would have to send your like wranglers for that.

47:34.660 --> 47:38.260
Now we're pitching a mouse hunt type movie where a hilarious like,

47:38.900 --> 47:42.740
you know, befuddled zookeeper shows up to help Kenneth catch Kyle,

47:42.740 --> 47:44.340
but Kyle cannot be caught.

47:44.340 --> 47:47.940
He is outsmarting them left and right while teaching the sons.

47:47.940 --> 47:49.140
I don't know about life.

47:49.140 --> 47:49.540
I don't know.

47:49.540 --> 47:52.580
But in the end, they all learn something from Kyle.

47:52.580 --> 47:54.100
Also, maybe he's magic.

47:54.100 --> 47:54.660
I don't know.

47:54.660 --> 47:57.220
We can focus group that later.

47:57.220 --> 48:00.340
Even animal control would be a bit of a stretch, right?

48:00.340 --> 48:01.620
Because he calls animal control.

48:01.620 --> 48:03.940
He's like, hi, Kyle the coyote.

48:03.940 --> 48:07.940
I don't know if you guys know him, but can you come kill him?

48:07.940 --> 48:08.980
What's he doing to you, sir?

48:09.620 --> 48:11.700
Well, nothing right now.

48:11.700 --> 48:14.660
But like earlier, he tore my wife's leggings.

48:14.660 --> 48:16.260
He taught my sons how to vape.

48:16.260 --> 48:20.660
And I really would like him to be killed, please.

48:20.660 --> 48:20.900
Really?

48:20.900 --> 48:21.620
Is he in your house?

48:21.620 --> 48:22.740
No, he's in the woods.

48:22.740 --> 48:24.100
If anything, I'm in his house.

48:24.100 --> 48:26.340
Yeah, he's in the woods like a regular coyote,

48:26.340 --> 48:28.340
but I just hate it when he comes around.

48:28.340 --> 48:29.140
I just hate knowing-

48:29.140 --> 48:31.940
Hey, animal control, could you come take my terrible children away?

48:31.940 --> 48:34.500
They keep luring coyotes to my house.

48:34.500 --> 48:37.700
I just hate knowing that he's out there somewhere thinking about-

48:38.980 --> 48:42.100
Kyle is out there putting the moves on my family and my house and everything.

48:42.100 --> 48:43.300
I'm trying to steal my-

48:43.300 --> 48:47.460
I have a, hi, I have a coyote who's doing identity theft to me

48:47.460 --> 48:50.900
and he's stealing my credit cards out of the like the shredded receipts

48:50.900 --> 48:52.100
out of there and put them back together.

48:52.660 --> 48:54.020
Kenneth, please stop calling.

48:54.020 --> 48:55.540
Hi, is this the number for animal control?

48:55.540 --> 48:56.980
Yes, Kenneth, what is it today?

48:56.980 --> 49:00.420
I was gonna make nachos to eat during the big game,

49:00.420 --> 49:02.020
but all the fucking ched's gone.

49:03.380 --> 49:06.340
Why is that even close to being our jurisdiction?

49:06.340 --> 49:07.780
I think it was two pounds.

49:07.780 --> 49:08.820
It was two fucking pounds.

49:08.820 --> 49:11.380
It was supposed to be all the ched I needed for the month.

49:11.380 --> 49:14.340
There's only one animal I know that can down that much ched.

49:14.340 --> 49:15.300
Oh God, no.

49:16.820 --> 49:18.100
No, no, no, no.

49:18.100 --> 49:21.060
That all like Kaiser Sose falls into place in his mind.

49:22.340 --> 49:24.500
He could just see Kyle putting all the pieces in place.

49:24.500 --> 49:26.500
You see four paws walking out of step

49:26.500 --> 49:28.740
and then they start like into a perfect prancing gallop

49:28.740 --> 49:30.980
and then you pan up a little bit

49:30.980 --> 49:33.220
and there's a big fur line cheesy mouth.

49:33.940 --> 49:35.860
And he's wearing sunglasses and he goes,

49:35.860 --> 49:38.260
hmm, nachos, cut to black.

49:40.500 --> 49:41.140
Fade to black.

49:41.140 --> 49:43.220
Fade to, no, don't fade, cut it, hard cut.

49:44.100 --> 49:44.980
Star wipe.

49:44.980 --> 49:47.540
No, not even star wipe, like nachos.

49:47.540 --> 49:49.300
Bam, a McElroy Brothers production.

49:50.900 --> 49:52.420
With some Guy Ritchie music.

49:52.420 --> 49:54.260
Fuck yeah, Guy Ritchie's band.

49:56.180 --> 49:57.460
Guy and the Family Richies.

49:57.460 --> 49:58.500
Rags to Richies.

50:00.980 --> 50:03.060
We're changing everything right now.

50:03.700 --> 50:04.740
Film, music.

50:06.260 --> 50:07.860
It's all on the fucking table.

50:07.860 --> 50:12.660
The world is ours, we just have to take it.

50:12.660 --> 50:14.340
Just have to reach out and take it.

50:16.580 --> 50:18.500
Rags to Richies is actually not a great idea

50:18.500 --> 50:20.580
because we would have to convince Guy Ritchie

50:20.580 --> 50:22.340
to start a family band.

50:22.340 --> 50:26.500
Yeah, and I don't like the movie is perfect.

50:27.140 --> 50:28.660
The movie is money in the bank.

50:29.540 --> 50:31.540
Rags to Richies is gonna be a tough sell.

50:31.540 --> 50:33.060
That's gonna be tough sell.

50:33.060 --> 50:35.780
But you do the movie to support Rags to Richies.

50:35.780 --> 50:36.660
I guess, yes.

50:36.660 --> 50:38.820
Sort of like, yeah, they form at the same time.

50:39.860 --> 50:42.820
Yeah, and you're driving business to Rags to Richies.

50:42.820 --> 50:46.980
Yeah, that's the secret to good business, is funneling.

50:49.620 --> 50:50.900
So what do we do now?

50:50.900 --> 50:52.180
I think we should end the show.

50:52.180 --> 50:54.260
Let's end the show, yeah, that's a great place to end.

50:54.820 --> 50:57.860
Hey, thank you all so much for listening to our program.

50:58.900 --> 51:00.500
Is everybody still recording, by the way?

51:00.500 --> 51:01.380
We didn't do a time check.

51:01.380 --> 51:01.940
Yeah, for sure.

51:03.300 --> 51:05.060
I wanna remind you to go to Nature Box,

51:05.060 --> 51:07.060
you can order hundreds of great tasting snacks.

51:07.060 --> 51:09.380

Fuck, those things are so fresh.

51:23.540 --> 51:24.340
Yeah, they're so good.

51:24.900 --> 51:26.740
I wanna say, I'm very excited to announce,

51:26.740 --> 51:28.820
I teased it a little bit in the last couple of episodes,

51:28.820 --> 51:31.140
but my wife Teresa and I are launching

51:31.140 --> 51:32.820
a new podcast called Schmaners.

51:32.820 --> 51:34.820
And it's all about extraordinary etiquette

51:34.820 --> 51:37.940
for ordinary occasions and how manners are used

51:37.940 --> 51:40.020
in the modern world, how they still apply.

51:40.020 --> 51:41.220
We just put a promo up.

51:41.220 --> 51:42.100
If you'd like to check it out,

51:42.100 --> 51:46.020
you can go to bit.ly forward slash Schmaners promo,

51:46.740 --> 51:49.860
or you can follow us on Twitter at Schmaners cast.

51:49.860 --> 51:53.460
And I posted like the RSS feed and a direct download link

51:53.460 --> 51:55.700
for the promo if you're non iTunes user.

51:55.700 --> 51:58.100
I did wanna ask Travis, I listened to the pilot episode

51:58.100 --> 51:59.860
and are you gonna end every episode

51:59.860 --> 52:02.980
with you and Teresa having a burping contest?

52:02.980 --> 52:04.820
Yeah, well, you know, we're trying to appeal

52:04.820 --> 52:07.780
to as much as to a wider audience as possible.

52:07.780 --> 52:09.860
It just doesn't seem mannerly to me, I guess.

52:09.860 --> 52:11.140
Okay, well, we're still working on it.

52:11.140 --> 52:12.100
So maybe we'll edit that out.

52:12.100 --> 52:13.940
I've gotta send it to Jesse for a couple last minutes.

52:13.940 --> 52:14.980
Sure, sure, sure.

52:14.980 --> 52:18.020
So maybe the 30 minute long burping contest will get cut.

52:18.020 --> 52:20.020
There was a lot, just like a lot of it.

52:20.020 --> 52:20.580
There was a lot.

52:20.580 --> 52:22.500
Yeah, and a lot of it was just like dry heaving.

52:22.500 --> 52:23.540
Yeah, it was really, really bad.

52:24.100 --> 52:26.820
But go check it out Schmaners at Schmaners cast

52:26.820 --> 52:28.180
or search for it on iTunes.

52:28.180 --> 52:29.620
I have some new projects.

52:29.620 --> 52:33.060
I have a new hit YouTube series called Griffin's Amiibo Corner

52:33.060 --> 52:35.700
where I put Nintendo brand Amiibo toys in my mouth

52:35.700 --> 52:36.500
and review them.

52:37.140 --> 52:37.940
I'm very proud of it.

52:37.940 --> 52:39.940
Just search YouTube for Griffin's Amiibo Corner.

52:40.900 --> 52:42.980
Justin and I do Monster Factory for Polygon,

52:42.980 --> 52:44.660
which we don't talk about a lot on the show,

52:44.660 --> 52:46.980
but is also I'm very proud of.

52:46.980 --> 52:48.900
I want you to know the latest episode

52:49.620 --> 52:51.060
and I won't give too much away,

52:51.060 --> 52:52.500
but when you're working on the face

52:52.500 --> 52:55.220
and you manipulate the mouth to make him talk,

52:55.220 --> 52:56.500
I was crying.

52:56.500 --> 52:57.300
Oh, good.

52:57.300 --> 53:01.700
Like I had a hard time breathing for the entirety of that.

53:01.700 --> 53:02.340
Thank you very much.

53:03.460 --> 53:05.780
Me and my wife Rachel have a Bachelor fancast

53:05.780 --> 53:06.900
called Rose Buddies.

53:06.900 --> 53:08.900
I'm gonna try and get an official podcast feed up for that,

53:08.900 --> 53:10.260
but right now they're up on SoundCloud.

53:11.140 --> 53:12.500
You can find that on SoundCloud.

53:13.060 --> 53:16.100
And I should be launching a new video game podcast this week

53:16.820 --> 53:20.020
with Polygon's Nick Robinson

53:20.020 --> 53:22.260
that I'm also really happy about.

53:22.260 --> 53:23.460
Might be next week on that one,

53:23.460 --> 53:24.820
but I'll let you know when it goes up.

53:24.820 --> 53:25.380
What's it called?

53:25.380 --> 53:28.500
I don't want to say.

53:28.500 --> 53:28.980
Okay.

53:28.980 --> 53:29.620
It's a really good one.

53:29.620 --> 53:31.220
It's a really great promo, Griffin.

53:31.220 --> 53:31.540
It's called

53:32.980 --> 53:33.220
Okay.

53:36.100 --> 53:38.740
I guess that's work it took to get to that point.

53:38.740 --> 53:38.900
Yeah.

53:38.900 --> 53:40.580
No, a ridiculous amount of work to get to.

53:41.620 --> 53:42.340
All right.

53:42.340 --> 53:43.060
That's going to do.

53:43.060 --> 53:44.740
Justin, do you have anything you want to plug?

53:44.740 --> 53:44.980
No.

53:45.780 --> 53:46.100
My baby.

53:46.100 --> 53:46.900
What about Sawbones?

53:46.900 --> 53:47.940
My baby's doing great.

53:47.940 --> 53:49.540
Sawbones is a medical history podcast

53:49.540 --> 53:51.380
that I make with my wife, Sydney.

53:51.380 --> 53:54.340
It is, you will learn something and you'll laugh

53:54.340 --> 53:55.460
and you'll laugh and learn.

53:55.460 --> 53:58.580
Our new episode is about green sickness,

53:58.580 --> 54:01.860
which is sort of like anemia,

54:01.860 --> 54:02.820
except it's fake.

54:03.380 --> 54:04.580
Okay, cool.

54:04.580 --> 54:05.300
It's a great app.

54:05.300 --> 54:06.820
So check that out.

54:06.820 --> 54:09.140
Sawbones on iTunes or at Sawbones on Twitter

54:09.140 --> 54:09.700
or what have you.

54:09.700 --> 54:11.380
I want to say thanks to John Roderick in the long winters

54:11.380 --> 54:12.900
for using our theme song, It's a Departure.

54:12.900 --> 54:14.660
Off the album, putting the days to bed.

54:14.660 --> 54:15.540
Terrific album.

54:15.540 --> 54:17.220
Always great for a listen.

54:17.220 --> 54:18.980
Any time of year, any mood,

54:18.980 --> 54:20.500
any feeling you're trying to capture,

54:20.500 --> 54:21.700
this album has it all.

54:21.700 --> 54:23.860
Also want to say a genuine thanks to Lin Manuel Miranda,

54:23.860 --> 54:24.980
who has turned the My Brother, My Brother,

54:24.980 --> 54:26.420
and Me Appreciation group on Facebook

54:26.420 --> 54:30.660
into just a nonstop fucking screaming, hilarious party.

54:30.660 --> 54:33.460
Yeah, if you are not on that Facebook group,

54:33.460 --> 54:34.500
you need to get there.

54:34.500 --> 54:35.460
Search for My Brother, My Brother,

54:35.460 --> 54:36.740
and Me Appreciation group.

54:36.740 --> 54:38.580
Just a quick note to people on there.

54:38.580 --> 54:39.860
We, just so you know,

54:39.860 --> 54:41.460
like when you try to put things on there

54:41.460 --> 54:42.500
and they don't appear,

54:42.500 --> 54:44.420
we're fairly stringent with like,

54:45.380 --> 54:47.460
like we had two posts this week

54:47.460 --> 54:50.020
that were videos of Tyra Banks

54:50.020 --> 54:54.660
and Carly Rae Jepsen saying hi to Griffin.

54:54.660 --> 54:56.740
So like, we try to keep a pretty high bar there.

54:58.260 --> 55:00.580
So if you notice that you're like putting things

55:00.580 --> 55:02.580
and it's not, they're just not going through,

55:03.540 --> 55:05.060
it's probably because we're not letting them through.

55:05.060 --> 55:06.740
Cause we're pretty, we're pretty strict about

55:06.740 --> 55:07.460
what we put up on that.

55:07.460 --> 55:09.380
What Justin is saying is find a celebrity

55:09.380 --> 55:11.700
and get them to reference our show in some way

55:11.700 --> 55:12.660
and then you'll make the cut.

55:13.380 --> 55:14.820
And like A-list please.

55:14.820 --> 55:16.100
A-list please.

55:16.100 --> 55:17.860
And please don't just fucking

55:17.860 --> 55:20.900
find a picture of a horse and say like,

55:20.900 --> 55:22.420
I know who loves horses.

55:22.420 --> 55:22.980
Stop it.

55:23.860 --> 55:25.460
We do love, like we do love horses.

55:25.460 --> 55:26.420
We do love horses,

55:26.420 --> 55:27.940
but we already have all those pictures.

55:27.940 --> 55:29.860
Print it out and paste it all over our room

55:29.860 --> 55:30.980
like serial killers.

55:30.980 --> 55:31.220
Yeah.

55:32.420 --> 55:33.060
All right.

55:33.060 --> 55:34.580
So y'all want the final yahoo?

55:34.580 --> 55:34.980
Hit me.

55:36.340 --> 55:39.140
This one was sent in by Zoe Kinski.

55:39.140 --> 55:39.940
Climbing that ladder.

55:39.940 --> 55:40.580
Thank you, Zoe.

55:40.580 --> 55:41.300
It's also sent in,

55:41.300 --> 55:43.620
I did a Google search or a Gmail search for it.

55:43.620 --> 55:46.340
It's also sent in by Russell Troyer like a month ago

55:46.340 --> 55:47.300
and I just missed it.

55:47.300 --> 55:47.780
Weird.

55:47.780 --> 55:48.980
Thank you to both of you.

55:49.700 --> 55:50.660
It's a smash hit.

55:50.660 --> 55:53.620
It's from Roxie's girl who asks,

55:55.620 --> 55:58.660
army wife or Arby's wife.

56:00.580 --> 56:01.860
I'm Justin McElroy.

56:01.860 --> 56:03.220
I'm Travis McElroy.

56:04.180 --> 56:05.140
I'm, oh fuck.

56:05.140 --> 56:05.620
What was it?

56:05.620 --> 56:06.260
Bliss Delight.

56:06.260 --> 56:08.900
Thank you for listening to My Brother, My Brother, Me.

56:08.900 --> 56:21.940
Kiss your dad's square on the lips.

56:39.140 --> 56:40.100
We have today.

56:40.100 --> 56:42.740
It's like the line I know it's on a favorite album,

56:42.740 --> 56:45.060
but for everything in culture.

56:45.060 --> 56:47.860
It makes me happy to hear music I've never heard before.

56:47.860 --> 56:50.260
Voices I'd never thought to listen to

56:50.260 --> 56:53.540
and culture recommendations that are outside my comfort zone.

56:53.540 --> 56:54.900
That's why I listen to Bullseye.

56:55.460 --> 56:56.660
You should too.

56:56.660 --> 56:58.500
Bullseye's your guide to what's good

56:58.500 --> 57:11.300
for Maximum Fund.org and NPR.
