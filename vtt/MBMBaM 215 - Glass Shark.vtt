00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:31.120
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:31.120 --> 00:40.720
It's a new craze, and good girls do you wanna just say, hey, I wanna, just say, hey, I wanna.

00:45.120 --> 00:50.800
Well, howdy, everybody. Welcome to my brother, my brother, and me. It's an advice show for the

00:50.800 --> 00:59.280
modern era. We're just pleased as punch to have you here. I am Justin McElroy. I'm Travis McElroy.

00:59.280 --> 01:07.520
I'm Griffin McElroy. I think I know what's going on. It is so great to have you guys on the show,

01:07.520 --> 01:14.880
just to be doing this podcast with you. Oh, I'm feeling, feeling pretty fine. Oh, God. Oh, God.

01:14.880 --> 01:21.440
Justin's biting me. I'm just doing just dandy too. I'm finer than frogs hair split four ways.

01:22.000 --> 01:26.880
Sand it down too, I should hope. Sand them right down. I just flew in from downstairs,

01:26.880 --> 01:32.400
and boy am I, well, you know how that old chestnut goes. Oh, I see. You've caught the dad real hard.

01:32.400 --> 01:39.760
I'm just a father. I come at comedy from my own unique perspective, colored by my life with my

01:39.760 --> 01:44.720
wife and my beautiful baby daughter. I'm just a where dad, because Justin passed his

01:44.720 --> 01:52.160
foul darkness into me, vis-a-vis fluid transaction. Boys, what's on the docket today? I hope we can

01:52.160 --> 01:57.680
try to keep it clean. We're going to probably talk about dicks. Dicks and balls. Well, that seems like

01:58.560 --> 02:03.680
old version of my brother, my brother and me. I'm not sure. Do you want to play catch?

02:05.680 --> 02:09.920
That would be better. I think we could probably split the difference. With dicks and balls.

02:09.920 --> 02:16.080
No, we could probably land somewhere in the billing vol territory. Okay. Yeah. He gets a

02:16.080 --> 02:19.840
little colorful from time to time, but at the end of the day, you know, you're going to get off this

02:19.840 --> 02:23.760
roller coaster and you're going to have all your limbs attached. You know what I mean? My brother,

02:23.760 --> 02:30.080
my brother and me is just about three guys shooting the shoot and talking about what

02:30.080 --> 02:34.480
grinds their gears. You're going to laugh a little, you're going to learn a little,

02:34.480 --> 02:41.520
and you're going to learn a lot. My brother, my brother and me gives its own unique approach to

02:41.520 --> 02:47.520
comedy. It's from a Christian family perspective, but a little bit skewed. Thanks for buying our

02:47.520 --> 02:52.960
audio cassette at the Christian family bookstore. Or your local Zondervans.

02:54.960 --> 02:58.880
You can also listen to our totally clean hockey comedy podcast,

02:58.880 --> 03:02.800
HE Double Hockey Sticks. Thank you for listening to both programs.

03:05.440 --> 03:08.720
Justin, you back? I am back. All right, let's do the show.

03:08.720 --> 03:13.360
Sorry, the little one had to, uh, had a poopsie. You know how that is,

03:13.360 --> 03:21.440
is late night food. Can you watch your fucking language? Okay, straight up, I haven't, I haven't

03:21.440 --> 03:30.000
slept. Do you think that is going to be a lot of, you think that that is just a goofy thing people

03:30.000 --> 03:35.600
say? And I got irritated because it was the thing that everybody was saying. Everyone,

03:35.600 --> 03:41.040
ah, catch up on your sleep. I hope you, you cannot, you cannot put enough hours in the bank.

03:41.040 --> 03:45.760
First off, sleep doesn't work like that. Anyway, you cannot put enough hours in the bank for a

03:45.760 --> 03:52.640
human that knows nothing about time or, or darkness or anything and how that will infringe on your

03:52.640 --> 03:58.000
life. Yeah. From one of those things, like you think like this is surely as tired as I could

03:58.000 --> 04:03.040
possibly get. And then you proceed to get more tired. And then no matter how tired you get,

04:03.680 --> 04:09.200
there's nothing, there's nothing you can do. It's not like, no, I'm so sleepy. So I'm going to sleep

04:09.200 --> 04:18.480
now. Baby, I heard that over there, but I'm sleeping now and I will catch you in a few.

04:18.480 --> 04:23.440
The best, the, probably the, the thing that makes me happiest so far is that the baby has really

04:23.440 --> 04:29.920
good timing. It has good comedic timing. By which I mean, I'll get up fucking stumbling around,

04:30.800 --> 04:34.800
stumble over the changing table, change your wiper little tushy,

04:34.800 --> 04:40.800
feed her. Mom will feed her and then we'll sit, we'll get her all fed. Then we'll put her in her,

04:40.800 --> 04:45.920
she has a baby straight jacket. She sleeps in and we'll get her that. We'll lull her to sleep

04:45.920 --> 04:51.680
and I'll gingerly lay her down bomb squad style. Just not want to trip any wires. It's going to

04:51.680 --> 04:56.240
wake her back up. I'll sneak back over to my side of the bed. I'll get in my, my snugly,

04:56.240 --> 05:01.680
snugly pre-kid position for how I would sleep when I still slept. And then I'll just hear from across

05:01.680 --> 05:11.440
the room. A huge, massive, massive screaming dump. And you know what the best part about the dump is?

05:11.440 --> 05:16.320
The best part about the dump is the baby will dump and then not cry, but fucking stare at me like,

05:16.320 --> 05:21.920
what's up? What's up now old man? Are you going to leave me here with my little week old tushy?

05:21.920 --> 05:28.480
My three week old tushy? Are you, are you man enough to just sleep there while my little baby

05:28.480 --> 05:34.000
tushy sits in poopy? Are you man enough or are you going to come over here and pick me up?

05:35.600 --> 05:40.560
The most horrifying thing I think that you've told me about this situation and it's a, it's an

05:40.560 --> 05:46.000
enormous list. Um, and I'm sorry, by the way, that I just referred to the beautiful human life you

05:46.000 --> 05:53.120
created as a situation. But let's, uh, move on. Um, the horrifying thing you told me is that

05:53.120 --> 06:02.160
that baby's poop, when that zone gets stimulated, and one way to stimulate that zone is to clean

06:02.160 --> 06:10.320
the poop off of it. Yeah. Babies are hilarious. That's a real, like, um, yeah, that's, that's a,

06:10.960 --> 06:16.160
you're playing with fire. Anytime you clean a baby's butt, you're playing fire. The baby's

06:16.160 --> 06:21.600
gonna be like, oh man, I forgot I had a butt. Thank you. Thank you. What was the thing that I

06:21.600 --> 06:25.360
did with- Thank you, poorly gentleman. What was the thing I did with my butt? Oh, that's right.

06:26.000 --> 06:31.920
That's it. Should we do- Do you mind if I put this in your hand? Should we do advice now? That's a

06:31.920 --> 06:36.560
good place for it. Yeah. I love that we joked about doing the thing and then we did the thing.

06:37.360 --> 06:42.400
Well, I mean, yeah. I mean, that's the fucking McElroy way. It's a slice of life. That's what

06:42.400 --> 06:46.640
we do here on My Brother and My Brother. Tragedy, tragedy plus, tragedy plus this podcast equals

06:46.640 --> 06:51.520
comedy. Yes. Cause that's, that's my life right now. Nah, she's great. It's fine. I actually would

06:51.520 --> 06:57.360
say in this circumstance, poop in your hand, plus me not being you equals very, very funny.

06:57.360 --> 07:02.000
Fair enough. All right. Let's, uh, we still help people on the show. Sometimes. Sometimes we play

07:02.000 --> 07:08.720
fucking Dungeons and Dragons. Yeah. Uh, sometimes we do Griffin. Um, but, uh, right now we're helping

07:08.720 --> 07:14.160
people. So let's do this. Thank you by the way, for, for continuing to put the show together in

07:14.160 --> 07:18.960
my absence, Griffin and Travis. I really appreciate it. You're welcome. Just don't do this again.

07:19.520 --> 07:26.160
Yeah. I won't. Not for, uh, for nine months at least. My girlfriend and I recently went to a

07:26.160 --> 07:33.440
movie. Okay. Wanting good seats, we went to a row in the middle of the auditorium and selected seats

07:33.440 --> 07:38.320
in the middle of the row. As soon as we sat down, a girl in the seats behind us very loudly said,

07:38.320 --> 07:43.040
seriously? I glanced back a minute later and saw that she had moved a few seats to her left

07:43.040 --> 07:49.840
so that she wasn't directly behind us. Are we good? Or did we commit a film viewer faux pas by

07:49.840 --> 07:54.000
sitting in front of her? To our credit, it was stadium seating and neither one of us are very

07:54.000 --> 07:59.760
tall. That's from naive in North Dakota. Interesting. Um, yeah, because are we talking

07:59.760 --> 08:03.200
about sight lines or sight lines? The issue, or is this the issue that you went to what sounds

08:03.200 --> 08:09.600
like a relatively empty movie theater and decided to sit, um, you didn't leave a buffers, uh, uh,

08:09.600 --> 08:14.480
because proximity is an issue. Proximity is an issue there, but I would say, here's the thing.

08:14.480 --> 08:21.680
That's her issue and not yours. I think, I know you walk into a movie theater. If someone sits

08:21.680 --> 08:26.960
too close to you and you want to move the onus is on you at that point. I don't think I don't know

08:26.960 --> 08:31.200
about that. If it's otherwise empty and someone sits directly in front of me, that's going to

08:31.200 --> 08:35.520
feel intentional to me. No, I'm going to tell you it's intentional if it's directly beside.

08:35.520 --> 08:41.440
No, I know in front works too. And, and, but here's the thing I, in a trillion years, in a,

08:41.440 --> 08:47.040
in a bajillion years, I could be at the midnight opening of the last Harry Potter movie, which I

08:47.040 --> 08:52.000
don't know if you guys knew this is my most anticipated and also greatest film of all time.

08:52.000 --> 08:57.920
And for some miraculous reason, the theater was empty except for myself. And then somebody walked

08:57.920 --> 09:03.920
in and sat in front of me. I wouldn't fucking say anything. I wouldn't cause you're trying to

09:03.920 --> 09:09.600
get whisked. Yeah. And like saying that is going to impact both my experience, their experience,

09:09.600 --> 09:13.920
the experience of everybody who has to be a part of the fact that I just made it super uncomfortable.

09:14.960 --> 09:21.440
Is it possible that she was not referring to you sitting down, but some other factor that

09:21.440 --> 09:26.080
had just become impaired? Like she just realized did you, did you let out, did you let out a huge

09:28.880 --> 09:32.880
maybe she just sat down and found that the chair she was sitting in was full of farts.

09:32.880 --> 09:38.800
The foam had absorbed the fart of a two hour previous movie. Okay. So maybe you sat down and

09:38.800 --> 09:44.480
almost at that exact same instant, she put her hand on her armrest. Oh my God. There's jelly

09:44.480 --> 09:54.400
all over it. Seriously? Justin's been here. Who ordered that pricey movie theater jelly only to

09:54.400 --> 10:00.240
leave it on the armrest. The trick is you bring your own in a little Ziploc bag. Travis. That's

10:00.240 --> 10:05.520
how you get past it. They charge like six 50 for some jelly. People like you, they're ruining the

10:05.520 --> 10:10.160
jelly industry. They're just had to say, you know, you go to the Alamo draft house, they bring you

10:10.720 --> 10:15.360
craft brew jelly during the movie. You don't have to get up and cause like you you'll finish

10:15.360 --> 10:20.160
jelly and like, I fuck, I can crush one of those tubs in like 20 minutes maybe. And then what am I

10:20.160 --> 10:24.560
going to do? Get up and do that maybe six times, seven times, depending on the length of the film.

10:24.560 --> 10:30.320
If I, if it was during fucking boyhood, we're talking about like 12 jam jars. I, I have to

10:30.320 --> 10:37.600
admit, I don't think it was a huge faux pas, but I do think that it is, it feels a little bit

10:37.600 --> 10:43.760
inconsiderate to sit directly in front of somebody when, when you have a lot of other. But I do,

10:43.760 --> 10:48.240
I do understand though, like if they picked middle seats and you picked middle seats,

10:48.240 --> 10:52.960
but maybe leave a row if possible, everybody wants to sit in the middle, especially in a

10:52.960 --> 10:58.720
big stadium seating, like IMAX kind of thing, but maybe leave a row, a row between you if possible.

10:58.720 --> 11:05.280
But that's okay. But that's not how space works. Like obviously the ideal like position is like

11:05.920 --> 11:11.040
row four or five in the direct center, right? And then the next best one is like the row behind that

11:11.040 --> 11:15.040
or in front of that in the same exact position. But then it's a, there's diminishing returns.

11:15.040 --> 11:20.880
You get too close. What am I fucking even seeing? Is that, is that, you know, Bradley Cooper's nose?

11:20.880 --> 11:26.800
No, it's a house. It's a raccoon. It's a raccoon. God damn this movie's transportative.

11:26.800 --> 11:31.440
Did you guys, did you guys remember, did you ever like when you were, you know, a teenager

11:31.440 --> 11:35.440
going on some dates, did you ever encounter a thing where like you'd sit and be by yourself

11:35.440 --> 11:40.880
and then either like it was always older people or like, you know, like wanting to sit close to

11:40.880 --> 11:43.680
you, like, I know what you guys are going to get up to, not on my watch.

11:43.680 --> 11:49.600
And I want to, or, or explicitly on my watch, only on my watch.

11:49.600 --> 11:54.960
I always got it. Like they were just trying to like ruin whatever, you know, necking I was

11:54.960 --> 11:59.280
planning for that evening. But maybe they were just going like, no, go, go on.

11:59.280 --> 12:03.120
Wait, you're telling me that, uh, old people tried to ruin something for me, Travis?

12:04.960 --> 12:06.640
I don't know. That doesn't sound like their MO.

12:07.280 --> 12:10.880
I think your mistake was being that the same movie that an old person would want to go see.

12:10.880 --> 12:14.640
Well, that's the thing is if you're like 15 or 16, that is your, like, you're going to see

12:14.640 --> 12:19.760
the toy story too. And guess what? So are super old people because they know there's not going

12:19.760 --> 12:26.720
to be any violence or boobs in it. I have a, a theater etiquette question for

12:26.720 --> 12:31.200
you guys. And I want to know if I'm making too big a deal out of this. I, uh, the, my,

12:31.200 --> 12:35.840
my like theater pet peeve that, I mean, obviously the, the obvious stuff, you know, talking during

12:35.840 --> 12:40.560
Godzilla and, and things like that, that drives me crazy. But, uh, people who continue their

12:40.560 --> 12:48.160
conversations once the trailers have begun, is that not, is that a DMZ or is that like,

12:48.160 --> 12:53.360
is that still a safe zone for chatting? Because some of us like trailers more than movies.

12:53.360 --> 12:57.360
A lot of times they're like short movies because I don't, I, I don't know if you guys know,

12:57.360 --> 13:01.040
I'm a dad now. I don't get to the theater a lot. So a lot of times trailers are going to be the

13:01.040 --> 13:04.560
closest I'm going to get to seeing that movie. So basically you're in, you're ruining the movie for

13:04.560 --> 13:11.280
me. Here's, I actually have a rule of thumb about this. If the movie theater lowers the lights to

13:11.280 --> 13:16.720
the same level that it's at for the movies, you lower your volume to the same level you would for

13:16.720 --> 13:21.280
a movie. If they take the lights to half, you can continue your conversation at half volume.

13:21.280 --> 13:26.720
Are you saying that in case of technical error that brings the house lights to full mid film,

13:26.720 --> 13:31.040
you will just start shouting. Have you ever been in a movie theater and they brought the

13:31.040 --> 13:36.000
lights up to full? Has everyone just stayed quiet? No, everyone goes, Hey, whoa. Travis actually

13:36.000 --> 13:39.360
follows that. I don't know if you noticed this, Justin, but Travis follows that rule

13:39.920 --> 13:45.680
with just his everyday sort of life. So like during the intimate times, maybe in the bedroom,

13:45.680 --> 13:52.960
he's like, Oh, what do you, I can't understand what you're saying to me. Are you trying to be

13:52.960 --> 14:00.400
intimate? Turn the lights up. My pee pee is ready. Well, turning down a little bit,

14:00.400 --> 14:06.320
maybe in the middle, Travis is basically photo sensitive at a baseball game at night with all

14:06.320 --> 14:11.120
the lights like blasting those fucking Friday night lights. Forget about it. Forget about it.

14:11.120 --> 14:15.680
He is the loudest thing in the universe. You guys want Yahoo? Absolutely. Yahoo was, um,

14:16.720 --> 14:22.960
so who was sent in by a man named Drew Davenport, a legend one might say. Thank you, Drew.

14:22.960 --> 14:31.280
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Pineapple Lifesaver, who asks, why do so many people buy Lunchables?

14:32.720 --> 14:38.560
You could put your own together for a lot cheaper. Just put some meat, cheese and crackers in a

14:38.560 --> 14:46.560
Gladware container. Well, fucking thanks, Einstein. It's an update. It's not cheaper though for the

14:46.560 --> 14:51.440
tiny handful of food that you get even at $1. They're using the cheapest quality of ingredients,

14:51.440 --> 14:56.960
buying some cheap turkey, American singles and Ritz saltines will give you the same amount of

14:56.960 --> 15:01.200
10 or more Lunchables for half the cost. Holy shit. That can't possibly be right.

15:01.840 --> 15:06.160
All right. First off, last for me. They're saying 10 or more Lunchables for half the

15:06.160 --> 15:09.920
cost. We're talking about 20 fucking homemade Lunchables per Lunchable proper.

15:11.680 --> 15:18.400
That's a lot of margin. Has anyone ever bought a Lunchable thinking, I am, I'm a thrifty consumer.

15:18.400 --> 15:25.200
This is, yeah, you're not, you are neither a thrifty, you're not fiscally smart. You are

15:25.200 --> 15:31.520
not making a good nutritional decision. You are basically just saying, I, I'm a piece of shit.

15:31.520 --> 15:34.720
Well, I just want to do things. Either you're saying like, I'm a piece of shit, or you're

15:34.720 --> 15:39.280
saying like, you know what? I'm going to little kid treat myself. Hey, eight year old Travis,

15:39.280 --> 15:44.080
who only wanted Lunchables all the time, but his mom packed him like actual sandwiches and apples

15:44.080 --> 15:47.840
and stuff because she cared for him. But at the time he would look around the other kids who ate

15:47.840 --> 15:52.160
Lunchables and think, what fun lives are they leaving? If only I was more of a Lunchables type

15:52.160 --> 15:57.280
kid, but I wasn't. So maybe 25 year old Travis buys eight year old Travis a Lunchable and sends

15:57.280 --> 16:08.080
it back to him through his tummy. We've got to go back. Can an adult not just enjoy a motherfucking

16:08.080 --> 16:15.280
Lunchable though, without those auspices? You guys are throwing a lot of shade at Lunchables right

16:15.280 --> 16:19.680
now. I knew we, I knew we love horses on this podcast, but I did not know we love high horses

16:19.680 --> 16:25.280
quite so much. But are Lunchables not the same? Like I put them in the same category as, uh,

16:25.280 --> 16:31.440
the Hot Pocket. The Toaster Strudel. Yeah, that's a fucked up Venn diagram you just weaved. A Hot

16:31.440 --> 16:37.040
Pocket's a lot of work. You gotta push the buttons and, and a lot of fiddling. A Lunchable,

16:37.040 --> 16:40.480
you have to construct your own. They don't just hand you a package. That's customizable. Kids

16:40.480 --> 16:46.000
love that. Let's um, we're getting away from the fucking heart of the matter. Um, and I want to

16:46.000 --> 16:50.480
get us back to it. And now, okay, if you want to fucking time travel, I'm eight years old. I roll

16:50.480 --> 16:58.960
up to school. I bust out a Gladware. DIY. It's a, it's a Lunchable. You've written Lunchable on it,

16:58.960 --> 17:02.880
but you spelled it differently to avoid copyright. Griffin, what the fuck is that? It's, it's a,

17:02.880 --> 17:09.520
it's a Munchable. It's a what? A Munchable? Dad, my dad made it for me and he said it's just as

17:09.520 --> 17:14.320
good. And what are you? I'm literally gonna cry. I'm literally gonna. What are you all eating?

17:14.320 --> 17:20.800
Uh, we're eating Lunchables that, uh, their brand name Lunchables that our rich parents got us at

17:20.800 --> 17:26.080
the store. What was yours called? Munchables. What's in it? Um, looks like some, looks like

17:26.080 --> 17:33.840
I got some oyster crackers and a nice note. What seems to be a hair. It looks like a hair. I'm,

17:33.840 --> 17:39.360
this is one of my, this is one of my new dad Jerry's hairs. The container smells like salami

17:39.360 --> 17:44.560
because it used to have salami in it. That's how we got it. We can't afford to buy Gladware either.

17:44.560 --> 17:50.320
We're just reusing the old containers. Have you guys ever noticed with Gladware when you store

17:50.320 --> 17:55.200
like a, maybe like a tomato sauce or a base product in it for an extended period of time

17:55.200 --> 18:00.560
and then you wash it and it's still that color? Yeah. What is happening there? What is the

18:00.560 --> 18:04.960
porousness of the material? I think it is photosynthesis. Is that, is that osmosing

18:04.960 --> 18:10.240
through the, through the plastic? Can you, is this a, can I rock Munchables in the modern workplace?

18:10.240 --> 18:15.600
If I roll up and I have a fucking Gladware container and I've written Munchables on there

18:15.600 --> 18:20.880
in a Sharpie and maybe some of the letters are backwards, uh, just to like really drive it home

18:20.880 --> 18:25.440
and, uh, I'm just like, Jerry from accounting walks in and he's like, what are you eating there?

18:25.440 --> 18:31.280
I say, oh, Munchables. Uh, and that. Wait, hold on. That voice worked for the eight-year-old.

18:31.280 --> 18:37.760
Yeah. I prepare a fucking snack cracker tower and I eat it from the top down like a T-Rex. Uh,

18:37.760 --> 18:43.360
am I okay? Am I good? I think, I think, I think if you, if I got to watch you do that,

18:43.360 --> 18:47.840
just make a huge stack of crackers and cheese and meat and then just deep throw it. Just put your

18:47.840 --> 18:54.000
head at the top and just keep jamming until it's all gone. Munchables. These, what, these are

18:54.000 --> 18:58.320
Munchables. Yeah, I'll make you some. I'll bring some in tomorrow. The weird thing is it's like a,

18:58.320 --> 19:03.200
the sadness is greater than the sum of its parts because if you just brought in like a container

19:03.200 --> 19:09.360
with crackers, a separate container with cheese slices, a separate container. But that's not weird

19:09.360 --> 19:15.120
to me, but you put it all in the same container and transport it that way and it's like a hundred

19:15.120 --> 19:20.960
percent sadder. Of course, context is important in this situation. If I eat crackers and then

19:20.960 --> 19:26.560
in another room I eat some lunch meat, it's not going to be a thing. But if I try to give it my

19:26.560 --> 19:32.400
own DIY fucking Pinterest branding, then we have a situation, all right? I, this is an interesting

19:32.400 --> 19:38.560
question for you about Lunchables. If you go to a party, let's say, where there are crackers and

19:38.560 --> 19:44.240
cheese and little pieces of meat, I don't think there's a number of those things that you would

19:44.240 --> 19:50.720
eat at which point you would say, well, I've had lunch now. Me? Did you have lunch? Yes, I did.

19:50.720 --> 20:02.000
You guys are limiting your scope to the fucking snack cracker Lunchable box set. There was a lot

20:03.200 --> 20:10.480
more variety in there for our dirty North American bento boxes, essentially is what we're talking

20:10.480 --> 20:18.640
about. I don't know if you guys ever sampled the pizza, which was pizza but cold. I have very clear

20:18.640 --> 20:26.880
memories of watching an adjacent rich kid eat the pizza Lunchable and being physically repulsed at

20:26.880 --> 20:33.200
the idea of eating cold, all of it cold. And they would call it pizza and it turned my stomach even

20:33.200 --> 20:40.240
more. Let me take you down the Oubliette to even further just peer into the darkness with me and

20:40.240 --> 20:49.280
we'll talk about the definition of the word soft taco because Lunchables also had that gain. It

20:49.280 --> 20:55.680
wasn't especially on point because you had a round thing. It was the pizza crust. It was the fucking

20:55.680 --> 21:03.120
pizza crust. And then they had a cold, essentially giant ketchup packet, but instead of ketchup,

21:03.120 --> 21:13.920
it was ground meat question mark. I don't know how you would meet was a meat was in quotation

21:13.920 --> 21:20.080
marks. It was also an acronym. It was as bad news bears. I don't know how you would recreate that

21:20.080 --> 21:25.360
for the Munchables brand, but I think that there is a lot of opportunity in there. We could probably

21:25.360 --> 21:32.480
get some vegan free option, vegan free, gluten free, no vegan. I think all Lunchables are inherently

21:32.480 --> 21:36.560
vegan free. Anyway, this person has a great point. I'm going to take this to Shark Tank. Thank you,

21:36.560 --> 21:41.680
Yahoo. A few years ago, I took the plunge and moved to Reykjavik, Iceland. It's a beautiful

21:41.680 --> 21:45.040
country and its popularity as a vacation destination has been growing over the past few

21:45.040 --> 21:49.760
years. There are frequently cruise ships docked here, which discharged a few hundred tourists

21:49.760 --> 21:54.160
every few days. Man, I hope this question is about a grift. I haven't finished it yet, but

21:56.160 --> 21:59.680
when I walk through the city, I encounter lots of said tourists taking photos.

21:59.680 --> 22:03.600
My question is, what's the acceptable social norm when you encounter someone taking a photo

22:03.600 --> 22:08.880
and you're passively through their field of vision? Should I wait for the person to take the photo,

22:08.880 --> 22:12.960
continue on my way, regardless of whether or not it would ruin the shot? Any advice you could

22:12.960 --> 22:18.240
offer me? Much appreciated. That's from In Frame in Iceland. That's beautiful. I'd love to get up

22:18.240 --> 22:24.480
there sometime. I was just watching The Simpsons about that. The travelogue of The Simpsons.

22:24.480 --> 22:34.800
Do they get the Aurora Boreanus up there? The David Boreanus? That was in the episode of The

22:34.800 --> 22:44.320
Simpsons, so I'm hoping so. I say keep on keeping on. I think JKL, I think just keep living and just

22:44.320 --> 22:49.280
keep walking. If they get you in the shot, then they have actually gotten some fucking local

22:49.280 --> 22:54.320
wildlife in the picture. Yeah, I think you go one step further. I think you don't just

22:54.320 --> 23:00.240
walk through. You get in the shot. You pose. You act like, look at this! Give it kind of a thing

23:00.240 --> 23:04.640
like they asked you to be in the picture, or even better, they were like, hey, Steve, get over here.

23:04.640 --> 23:10.480
I'm going to take a picture of you. Then you just kind of pose and gesture towards the mountains.

23:10.480 --> 23:14.480
I think it loses some of the magic if they have to ask for it. Then it's not candid. I think maybe

23:14.480 --> 23:18.960
you carry around a giant swordfish with you, a really big swordfish that maybe has a little bit

23:18.960 --> 23:23.520
of ice still on it. Whenever you see somebody taking a picture, you scurry over there as fast

23:23.520 --> 23:27.680
as you can, and you hold that swordfish over your head proudly, and you make like a jovial laughing

23:27.680 --> 23:34.240
face. It's like, look at this, I caught this local swordfisherman mid-catch. How happy is he? God,

23:34.240 --> 23:42.160
I wish I was that happy anymore, Diane. That's how memories are made. I think it's all about

23:42.160 --> 23:47.360
your angle. If you're behind the person, then you're local color. If you're in front, in the

23:47.360 --> 23:52.480
foreground, you're messing up the focus. You're making yourself, I mean, you're basically turning

23:52.480 --> 23:59.440
it into an album cover for you. That's such a good question. Are these people taking photos of the

23:59.440 --> 24:05.760
scenery, or are they taking pictures of people? Because if it's of people, I'm way less likely

24:05.760 --> 24:10.960
to keep going. But if it's just taking a picture of a beautiful building they found or a lovely

24:10.960 --> 24:16.800
landscape, yeah, I'm just going to keep walking. I think the problem, though, with your guys'

24:16.800 --> 24:24.000
two lines of logic is that you're thinking about the feelings and desires of the picture-taker,

24:24.000 --> 24:31.760
and not my own feelings and desires, to become either an internet meme of like swordfish Iceland

24:31.760 --> 24:40.800
man, or maybe a local legend vis-a-vis the mothman. Only I'd be swordfish man, and I would

24:40.800 --> 24:46.080
I would carry with me portents of terrible destruction. So like you would hold the

24:46.080 --> 24:50.320
swordfish, but like maybe have your back to the camera and just the last minute turn and look

24:50.320 --> 24:55.280
back. Just like half a face and a swordfish. And it's like he's in every photo. He's in every photo

24:55.280 --> 25:01.120
that's been taken in Reykjavik today. How did that happen? Oh, it's just like on, oh what's that show

25:01.120 --> 25:07.120
with the kid from the Dawson's Creek, and then it's the fringe, it's the fringe, and there's the

25:07.120 --> 25:12.960
bald man. He's in all the photos, and he's holding a swordfish. It's also Dawson's Creek. There was a

25:12.960 --> 25:16.960
season where there was just a guy just, and he had a swordfish, and he was in every shot of the show.

25:17.600 --> 25:22.400
Did you guys know the observer, which Travis refers, is from Huntington, West Virginia?

25:22.400 --> 25:26.080
Well, you just think that because he's fucking all over the place. He's everywhere. He's everywhere.

25:26.080 --> 25:29.440
Did you watch the show? Yeah, I mean I watched the show. I'm just saying he's from Huntington.

25:29.440 --> 25:39.120
Did you get the symbolism of the swordfish? I saw swordfish. Keep going. Keep going with it.

25:40.480 --> 25:46.240
Keep going deeper. That's all. It was inoffensive, I'd say. Some of the hacking was a little harder

25:46.240 --> 25:52.640
to buy, specifically the Hugh Jackman hacking. Specifically all of it. Hugh Jackman. Don't buy it.

25:52.640 --> 25:58.640
Keep going. I don't have it. What do you want me to say, Travis?

25:58.640 --> 26:00.640
Johnson-Wolter was in it. Read another question.

26:00.640 --> 26:04.400
I wish Johnson-Wolter got more work. There, I said it. My wife is terrified of round fish.

26:04.400 --> 26:06.560
Uh-oh. We like to be outside. See what I mean?

26:06.560 --> 26:09.760
I love adventuring in the water. Okay, stop right there.

26:11.360 --> 26:18.880
Pump the brakes, chief. I love adventuring in the water, but anytime we leave the shore,

26:18.880 --> 26:25.360
my- Are you a pirate? Like just the beach. Okay. My wife freaks out because there might be round

26:25.360 --> 26:30.400
fish near her. Apparently flat fish are fine. She agrees it's an irrational fear, but just-

26:30.400 --> 26:34.960
Let me just finish this. She agrees it's an irrational fear, but just today she ran crying

26:34.960 --> 26:40.000
to the shore because a four-inch trout swam by her. I'm sure that's something she wanted

26:40.000 --> 26:46.640
the internet to know. Great job, sir. I don't want to give up my aquatic activities,

26:46.640 --> 26:51.280
but I don't know how to help her get over her fear. N-B-N-B-A-M. What do I do? And that's from

26:51.760 --> 26:54.080
ichthyophobicintribe. God damn, Justin.

26:54.720 --> 26:55.360
Nailed it.

26:55.360 --> 26:58.720
You just said that word fucking- Even like sleep battle.

26:58.720 --> 27:01.680
Just like saying your words is not like your best thing,

27:01.680 --> 27:05.680
and that's the hardest word I've ever seen, and you did 100% right.

27:05.680 --> 27:07.440
Also, you said Reykjavik really good.

27:07.440 --> 27:09.600
You did a great job.

27:11.360 --> 27:12.000
Great job.

27:12.000 --> 27:17.200
Thanks. Apparently what I've been missing all these years? A reason to live.

27:17.200 --> 27:18.800
Yep. So-

27:19.440 --> 27:20.000
Who knew?

27:20.880 --> 27:22.800
Round fish. Is that-

27:22.800 --> 27:24.640
Round fish? Okay, what are we talking about?

27:24.640 --> 27:30.080
Is it everything but a stingray? Because bad news bears, that's the scariest fish that exists.

27:30.080 --> 27:33.600
No, what's the one that's the one that stays on the floor of the ocean,

27:33.600 --> 27:38.080
but it's just like it has the eye on both sides? Perch?

27:38.080 --> 27:44.480
I mean like, is it like how Nemo's are flat and like fish like that,

27:44.480 --> 27:45.920
like that don't have a lot of girth?

27:45.920 --> 27:49.360
And then there's like the sea man, and he's got the face and he's all round.

27:49.360 --> 27:49.920
No, Travis.

27:49.920 --> 27:52.480
Nobody. Nobody's afraid of sea man. Everybody loves sea man.

27:52.480 --> 27:52.960
So kind.

27:55.520 --> 28:00.480
Okay, so the one thing that is weird about this is that I'm assuming if it's trout,

28:00.480 --> 28:03.200
aren't trout just exclusively freshwater fish?

28:03.200 --> 28:03.440
Yeah.

28:03.440 --> 28:04.400
Am I incorrect here?

28:05.360 --> 28:07.280
We have no way of proving that. Probably not.

28:07.280 --> 28:09.280
There's probably one trout that swam in the ocean was like,

28:09.280 --> 28:11.360
I'll kick it here. And then they had-

28:11.360 --> 28:18.240
I get way more worried about like aquatic life when I'm in like a lake or a river.

28:18.240 --> 28:20.880
Above the ocean? More than the ocean? Really?

28:20.880 --> 28:25.920
Yeah. I just find it much more, I think in the ocean it's just, I don't know.

28:25.920 --> 28:31.280
I get a much more like under the sea kind of vibe.

28:31.280 --> 28:35.520
And I guess when I'm in freshwater, I get more of like a opening of true blood.

28:35.520 --> 28:37.120
Okay. So is it possible-

28:37.120 --> 28:39.920
A big old catfish swimming around through the reefs.

28:39.920 --> 28:42.560
You're assuming that the fish in the ocean are just like,

28:43.280 --> 28:46.400
we live in the biggest fucking body of water.

28:46.400 --> 28:47.600
There's fucking rules.

28:47.600 --> 28:50.320
And fish in a lake are like, God damn those ocean.

28:50.320 --> 28:55.040
Our shit is like one, one trillionth of one percent of ocean.

28:55.040 --> 28:56.240
Cool. Glad we're here.

28:56.240 --> 28:56.480
Right.

28:56.480 --> 28:59.760
Would love to catch a plane and what's that? No fish planes.

28:59.760 --> 29:01.040
Yeah. I guess that makes sense.

29:01.040 --> 29:03.440
Oh, my body would die in the ocean. That sounds fair.

29:03.440 --> 29:05.520
Thanks fish Jesus.

29:05.520 --> 29:08.720
I'm real confused. If your wife is so afraid of fish,

29:08.720 --> 29:11.920
why, why is she continually putting herself in a position

29:11.920 --> 29:14.080
to be the only place where fish are?

29:14.640 --> 29:16.560
Well, it sounds like she's doing that to please.

29:18.880 --> 29:23.040
Well, why not canoe? Why not perhaps get a pontoon boat?

29:23.920 --> 29:27.120
Because then you're just like above the thing that you're afraid of.

29:27.120 --> 29:29.680
And they'll jump into the boat. You see that shit.

29:29.680 --> 29:32.960
You watch videos of like surfers like surfing

29:32.960 --> 29:35.280
and then like a stingray jumps through them.

29:35.280 --> 29:37.680
It's like, hey, great job catching that wave.

29:37.680 --> 29:39.360
You have a stingray shaped hole in you now.

29:40.800 --> 29:46.000
Can we focus? I think that, you know, a fear of fish, that's fine.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.880
I have a fear of mice. People have fears.

29:48.880 --> 29:51.440
My friend John Mahaffey is afraid of spiders so much.

29:51.440 --> 29:54.160
I think he pooped his pants when he saw some.

29:54.160 --> 29:55.600
Okay. People are afraid of things.

29:55.600 --> 29:59.200
Again, this is the episode where people say things about people

29:59.200 --> 30:01.200
that they don't want said about them on internet.

30:01.200 --> 30:07.680
What I am more concerned about is this guy is apparently so...

30:07.680 --> 30:11.920
We have two references to his aquatic pursuits.

30:11.920 --> 30:14.320
He loves adventuring in the water

30:14.320 --> 30:17.120
and he doesn't want to give up his aquatic activity.

30:17.120 --> 30:20.560
What is he doing that this is such an inconvenience

30:20.560 --> 30:21.760
that he would come to us over this?

30:22.320 --> 30:24.240
Everybody gets one pretty much.

30:24.240 --> 30:25.520
And this is this guy's one.

30:25.520 --> 30:30.320
What is he doing in the water that is so sacred

30:30.320 --> 30:32.080
that he can't give it up for his lady?

30:33.920 --> 30:37.360
Aquatic activities. Very, very suspect.

30:37.360 --> 30:39.200
You know what you could do, right?

30:39.840 --> 30:41.360
You could go to a pool.

30:42.640 --> 30:47.760
I used to, when I was a kid, I would sometimes get into the deep end of a pool

30:48.720 --> 30:51.840
and I would have the thought, what if there was a shark in here?

30:52.400 --> 30:55.760
And then over the next few minutes of being in the deep end,

30:55.760 --> 31:00.960
that thought would gradually congeal to, fuck me.

31:00.960 --> 31:02.720
There is a shark in here.

31:02.720 --> 31:08.240
So if you're wondering if people are born with anxiety or they develop it,

31:08.240 --> 31:10.560
I think you have your answer now.

31:10.560 --> 31:14.640
So Justin, the fact that you could see through the water didn't do anything?

31:14.640 --> 31:16.800
Don't matter. Don't matter. He was behind me.

31:16.800 --> 31:17.280
He's avoiding me.

31:17.280 --> 31:18.080
He's made of glass.

31:19.280 --> 31:21.120
Glass shark. Glass shark.

31:22.480 --> 31:24.080
Glass shark love fat kid.

31:24.080 --> 31:27.120
That's one thing about glass shark you gotta know.

31:27.120 --> 31:29.040
Glass shark, he loved a fat kid.

31:31.120 --> 31:33.280
You stay out the water, fat kid.

31:33.280 --> 31:34.960
Glass shark coming for you.

31:36.400 --> 31:39.280
He get you down there by deep water.

31:39.280 --> 31:41.440
That dark water, fat kid.

31:41.440 --> 31:42.400
No go.

31:42.400 --> 31:44.720
Glass shark come to that dark water.

31:44.720 --> 31:46.240
Get you fat kid.

31:46.240 --> 31:50.880
You swim around and you bite your trunks right off, you tubby little fish.

31:50.880 --> 31:54.720
You swim all you want, flop and flap around. Glass shark gonna come.

31:55.680 --> 31:57.760
Glass shark behind you, fat kid.

31:57.760 --> 31:59.440
You gotta swim.

31:59.440 --> 32:00.400
Swim faster.

32:00.400 --> 32:02.560
Pretend there's a corn dog at the end of the pool.

32:02.560 --> 32:03.920
Get out that dark water.

32:04.560 --> 32:08.080
That dark water and glass shark coming for you, fat kid.

32:08.720 --> 32:10.240
He make you a snack.

32:10.240 --> 32:11.280
He make you a snack.

32:11.280 --> 32:12.480
He eat your brother.

32:12.480 --> 32:13.200
He don't care.

32:13.200 --> 32:15.040
He glass shark.

32:15.040 --> 32:16.960
He in that bad dark water.

32:17.520 --> 32:18.960
Swim on over here.

32:18.960 --> 32:23.520
Why don't you cool off a little lemonade, wave that glass shark, move on down the next pond.

32:23.520 --> 32:24.560
Get that next fat kid.

32:24.560 --> 32:25.360
Don't let him get you.

32:26.080 --> 32:27.440
You seem all right though.

32:27.440 --> 32:29.120
Oh, fucking glass shark.

32:29.120 --> 32:31.760
And a friendship is formed that lasts the ages.

32:31.760 --> 32:33.360
Oh my god, glass shark.

32:35.120 --> 32:37.040
By the way, that guy wasn't black.

32:37.040 --> 32:38.000
He was from Louisiana.

32:38.000 --> 32:38.560
Oh, sure.

32:38.560 --> 32:39.280
We all got that.

32:39.280 --> 32:40.640
Just wanted to clarify.

32:40.640 --> 32:41.520
Should we go to the money zone?

32:41.520 --> 32:51.840
Okay.

32:51.840 --> 32:55.440
This week's episode is brought to you by Prosper.

32:56.160 --> 32:58.640
Just the idea that you can have money.

32:59.360 --> 32:59.840
Enjoy.

33:02.160 --> 33:04.240
The idea of being prosperous.

33:04.240 --> 33:06.560
It's brought to you by positive visualization.

33:06.560 --> 33:08.080
Focus on the word prosper.

33:08.080 --> 33:14.000
No, what if you knew that 72 hours from now you would have $35,000?

33:15.280 --> 33:16.400
What would you do?

33:16.400 --> 33:18.400
Coke bender.

33:18.400 --> 33:19.840
Coke bender.

33:19.840 --> 33:23.920
You pay off your credit cards, start a business, whatever you want to do.

33:23.920 --> 33:30.800
Prosper is the place you can go for a low fixed rate loan.

33:30.800 --> 33:31.600
Now, listen.

33:31.600 --> 33:34.480
This is not the kind of thing that you typically come to us for.

33:34.480 --> 33:35.040
We get that.

33:35.600 --> 33:37.440
You're already coming to us for this kind of thing.

33:37.440 --> 33:39.520
We know you're someone who likes to take chances.

33:39.520 --> 33:39.840
Okay.

33:40.480 --> 33:44.800
Prosper is the high tech answer to personal loans.

33:44.800 --> 33:49.200
They got a peer to peer lending process.

33:49.200 --> 33:50.880
They don't charge a bunch of fees.

33:50.880 --> 33:52.320
They don't raise interest rates.

33:52.320 --> 33:54.560
And you'll never ever, this is the best part.

33:54.560 --> 33:57.280
You'll never set foot in a bank.

33:57.920 --> 34:00.800
Listen, like anyone who's ever looked for a loan before.

34:00.800 --> 34:03.200
It's like a sweaty, awful process.

34:03.840 --> 34:04.480
You know what I mean?

34:04.480 --> 34:07.680
Even if you know you have good credit and you know you're in a good place,

34:07.680 --> 34:11.440
there's something about sitting down in the bank and having someone sit across from you

34:11.440 --> 34:15.600
while they go through every inch of your life in front of you and judge whether or not you're

34:15.600 --> 34:18.000
a good bet to give money to.

34:18.000 --> 34:21.040
So why not do it over the computer and not have to face that kind of judgment?

34:21.040 --> 34:21.840
You know?

34:21.840 --> 34:23.200
No sweat required.

34:23.200 --> 34:24.320
No sweating.

34:24.320 --> 34:30.240
But here is, if you think about it like any kind of funding site, this allows you to say,

34:30.240 --> 34:36.560
I need a loan for, you know, maybe you're doing a big cross-country trip or you need to,

34:37.120 --> 34:39.120
you know, fix the stairs on your house.

34:39.120 --> 34:39.680
Something like that.

34:39.680 --> 34:43.040
Something that you need a loan for and you plan to pay back.

34:43.040 --> 34:46.000
When you go to Prosper, you say, this is what I need the loan for.

34:46.000 --> 34:51.360
And then people throughout the world can give you that loan.

34:52.000 --> 34:57.200
And then, and when you pay back your loan, you're paying back them.

34:57.200 --> 34:59.600
So there's no bank involved.

34:59.600 --> 35:03.840
It's other people are giving you the money you need and then you're paying that back.

35:04.480 --> 35:09.120
And if you get a loan through Prosper and you tell them the brothers McElroy sent me,

35:10.000 --> 35:13.520
you can get a $50 visa prepaid card when you get that loan.

35:13.520 --> 35:15.520
Just go to prosper.com slash my brother.

35:16.240 --> 35:20.960
And you can actually get your, you can check your rate like instantly and it won't affect

35:20.960 --> 35:21.520
your credit score.

35:21.520 --> 35:26.560
So you can see, you know, sort of where you can get in at by going to prosper.com slash

35:26.560 --> 35:27.040
my brother.

35:27.040 --> 35:27.840
It's all one word.

35:27.840 --> 35:30.480
Travis, you have to read this legal stuff or else all three of us will go to jail.

35:31.040 --> 35:34.640
And you know, if you have any questions about it, there are other restrictions apply.

35:34.640 --> 35:38.080
You got to see the site for program and visa prepaid card details.

35:38.080 --> 35:42.880
All personal loans are made by web bank, a Utah chartered industrial bank.

35:42.880 --> 35:45.360
It's a member of FDIC, equal housing lender.

35:45.360 --> 35:47.600
So just go check it out for all the details.

35:47.600 --> 35:49.520
This is like a real ass thing.

35:49.520 --> 35:52.080
This is just like some funny website.

35:52.080 --> 35:55.440
You can tell it's a real ass thing because there was text we legally had to read or else

35:55.440 --> 35:57.040
we'd all go to jail together.

35:57.040 --> 35:57.920
Go check it out.

35:57.920 --> 35:59.280
That legal text.

35:59.280 --> 35:59.600
You know what?

35:59.600 --> 36:01.600
When you're getting your prosper loan, I have a great idea.

36:01.600 --> 36:04.800
When you're getting prosper loan, maybe cut yourself off just a little bit extra.

36:04.800 --> 36:06.880
Maybe just slide a few extra bucks in there.

36:06.880 --> 36:10.400
So you can go to naturebox.com and get yourself some food also.

36:11.040 --> 36:12.880
Maybe you need a loan for snacks.

36:12.880 --> 36:14.960
I need a snack loan.

36:14.960 --> 36:17.920
You're not going to need a snack loan with these snacks because these are affordable.

36:17.920 --> 36:18.640
They're healthy.

36:19.600 --> 36:21.040
They're delicious.

36:21.040 --> 36:24.880
There's no trans fat.

36:24.880 --> 36:28.080
There's no high fructose corn syrup.

36:28.080 --> 36:32.560
Some of the snacks are low in sugar and don't have gluten and they'll ship to you for free.

36:32.560 --> 36:40.560
You go to naturebox.com slash my brother and you pick out the snacks that look good to you.

36:40.560 --> 36:42.320
Are you guys rocking anything new?

36:44.160 --> 36:46.080
I haven't got a new box in a while.

36:48.160 --> 36:49.920
The peanut butter nom noms are very good.

36:49.920 --> 36:50.800
I'm actually on them.

36:50.800 --> 36:53.440
We got a coffee coated popcorn.

36:53.440 --> 36:55.520
Oh, that sounds amazing.

36:55.520 --> 36:56.080
Amazing.

36:57.120 --> 36:59.040
I'm on a fog cleanse actually.

37:00.960 --> 37:01.680
That's where you just...

37:02.640 --> 37:04.000
Oh, thanks for asking.

37:04.000 --> 37:05.520
It's where you just eat fog.

37:08.560 --> 37:11.600
You just eat fog, whether it's like natural.

37:11.600 --> 37:13.200
I mean, obviously the natural stuff is the best.

37:13.200 --> 37:14.720
If it's a foggy day outside, you just go outside.

37:15.920 --> 37:19.120
But otherwise you're going to need like one of those fogger machines that they use for like

37:19.120 --> 37:22.080
Easter pageants when they roll away the stone and it's like, whoa.

37:22.080 --> 37:26.880
Oh, but once you finish your fog cleanse, go to naturebox.com slash my brother.

37:26.880 --> 37:31.840
You're going to get 50% off of your first month's box and delivery is always free.

37:31.840 --> 37:32.960
So you don't have to worry about it.

37:34.240 --> 37:37.920
I'm telling you, every week it seems like more and more people are saying like,

37:37.920 --> 37:38.960
I finally tried it.

37:38.960 --> 37:39.360
Thanks.

37:39.360 --> 37:40.320
It's wonderful.

37:40.320 --> 37:42.080
So what the hell are you waiting for?

37:42.080 --> 37:42.960
What are you even doing?

37:42.960 --> 37:48.160
I got a message for Steven from Tacoma who says a happy birthday because you couldn't wait and

37:48.160 --> 37:50.640
opened all of your presents before your actual birthday.

37:50.640 --> 37:52.640
I went ahead and bought another one and hid it.

37:52.640 --> 37:53.440
Here's your clue.

37:53.440 --> 37:56.560
This one isn't in my office or in a closet.

37:56.560 --> 37:57.120
Good luck.

37:57.120 --> 38:00.080
And hopefully you don't find it before they read this message.

38:00.080 --> 38:02.080
If you do, you owe me like a whole dollar.

38:03.680 --> 38:08.400
I'm confused is I thought for a second that this was the present and that they hid it

38:08.400 --> 38:10.800
inside our fucking brains and voices.

38:11.600 --> 38:12.560
Oh my God.

38:12.560 --> 38:13.920
That's the best place to hide something.

38:13.920 --> 38:15.200
I think total recall.

38:16.480 --> 38:17.760
I got to say, Steven.

38:17.760 --> 38:20.400
Do you need to slow your fucking roll for like a minute?

38:20.400 --> 38:21.840
Do you not know how presents work?

38:22.400 --> 38:27.920
They are a representation of how thoughtful I am about like how much I know about you.

38:27.920 --> 38:30.240
And if you look that shit up ahead of time, you ruin it.

38:30.240 --> 38:30.800
You ruin it.

38:30.800 --> 38:35.600
And I'm just, I'm just going to throw this out in the day and age of Amazon and everything

38:35.600 --> 38:36.480
getting shipped to you.

38:36.480 --> 38:41.040
If you're within like two weeks of your birthday and you get a package, don't just tear into

38:41.040 --> 38:42.160
it like an animal.

38:42.160 --> 38:45.040
Clearly, clearly it's a birthday present, you fool.

38:45.040 --> 38:45.680
Yeah.

38:45.680 --> 38:46.560
Savor the flavor.

38:46.560 --> 38:48.080
Yeah, savor the flavor.

38:48.080 --> 38:50.640
It's from me, but really it's for me.

38:50.640 --> 38:52.720
Speaking of which, Griffin, one quick break.

38:52.720 --> 39:00.080
Griffin, I wanted to thank you because right before this podcast, my wife and I enjoyed

39:00.080 --> 39:05.200
the chicken pot pie that you bought for us and it was off the charts.

39:05.760 --> 39:08.480
We sent you that shit like mouth sloppingly delicious.

39:08.480 --> 39:09.600
Three weeks ago.

39:10.320 --> 39:10.640
Yeah.

39:10.640 --> 39:14.720
We were in the hospital for a little while and it's kind of hard to get home to cook

39:14.720 --> 39:15.120
a pot.

39:15.120 --> 39:17.200
I'm saying, but it was, it was still cool.

39:17.200 --> 39:18.320
I'm saying get pie.

39:18.320 --> 39:19.280
It's in the freezer.

39:19.280 --> 39:20.000
Okay.

39:20.000 --> 39:20.720
It's fine.

39:20.720 --> 39:23.360
It was absolutely delicious.

39:23.360 --> 39:28.320
I'm not going to mention who, who made the pie initially because pay me.

39:28.320 --> 39:28.720
Yeah.

39:28.720 --> 39:30.720
But, but yeah, it was delicious.

39:30.720 --> 39:31.280
I wanted to thank you for that.

39:31.280 --> 39:32.240
Well, thank Rachel.

39:32.240 --> 39:34.560
I didn't, I didn't get, I didn't get you a pie.

39:34.560 --> 39:35.040
I didn't.

39:35.040 --> 39:35.440
Technically.

39:35.440 --> 39:36.480
You got me lots of stuff.

39:36.480 --> 39:40.400
I got to tell you, I technically, I technically did also not get you a pie.

39:40.400 --> 39:43.040
My wife, my very thoughtful wife did.

39:43.040 --> 39:44.400
It was, it was really good.

39:44.400 --> 39:45.680
Okay, enough of that bullshit.

39:45.680 --> 39:48.880
Here's the greatest money zone spot we've ever had.

39:48.880 --> 39:50.000
Oh Jesus.

39:50.000 --> 39:51.360
Who is this message for?

39:51.360 --> 39:53.040
It's for present day, Chris.

39:53.040 --> 39:54.560
And who is this message from?

39:54.560 --> 39:55.600
From past Chris.

39:56.240 --> 39:57.920
Hey me, how's it going?

39:57.920 --> 40:00.080
You're probably stressed at work when they're reading this.

40:00.080 --> 40:01.680
So I hope this cheers you up.

40:01.680 --> 40:04.400
Speaking of work, did you get a new job yet?

40:04.400 --> 40:06.240
What about your gender stuff?

40:06.240 --> 40:06.880
No rush.

40:06.880 --> 40:08.640
But have you figured out any of that?

40:08.640 --> 40:10.400
Is the cat still peeing on the rug?

40:10.400 --> 40:11.200
I bet he is.

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
That PB boy can't be stopped.

40:14.000 --> 40:15.360
All the best, you.

40:19.520 --> 40:25.360
And when asked what date he wanted, he said, surprise me.

40:26.160 --> 40:26.960
Oh shit.

40:27.520 --> 40:29.760
See, this is how you hide a fucking present.

40:29.760 --> 40:33.040
Fucking Chris hid a fucking present from himself.

40:33.040 --> 40:35.040
And he gave me the joy of giving it to him.

40:35.040 --> 40:35.920
I'm going to throw that out.

40:35.920 --> 40:37.360
I'm not going to jump to conclusions.

40:37.360 --> 40:37.600
Yeah.

40:38.240 --> 40:40.400
But it's the greatest thing.

40:40.400 --> 40:44.080
All I can picture is that Chris hit enter in the keyboard

40:44.080 --> 40:46.240
and then erase this memory.

40:46.240 --> 40:48.560
Just somehow there's like a eternal sunshine

40:48.560 --> 40:50.640
on the spotless mind was gone.

40:50.640 --> 40:52.400
This is solving a sustainability problem

40:52.400 --> 40:54.240
that we've had for so long now, which

40:54.240 --> 40:57.920
is that if everybody on Earth buys a money zone spot

40:57.920 --> 41:00.240
for somebody else on Earth, we are

41:00.240 --> 41:02.000
halving the number of money zone spots

41:02.000 --> 41:04.640
we could ultimately get if everybody just bought them

41:04.640 --> 41:06.080
for their own fucking selves.

41:07.040 --> 41:10.000
And then that's a direct ROI.

41:10.000 --> 41:12.880
Travis says that this is the best money zone message ever.

41:13.600 --> 41:16.720
Is this best better than thanks for vibing

41:16.720 --> 41:17.440
and keeping it tight?

41:18.560 --> 41:19.120
Hit me up.

41:19.120 --> 41:20.000
I'm on my mobile.

41:20.000 --> 41:20.400
OK.

41:20.400 --> 41:20.960
OK.

41:20.960 --> 41:22.960
That wins for best content.

41:23.680 --> 41:25.600
This wins for best concept.

41:25.600 --> 41:26.240
Conceptual.

41:26.240 --> 41:28.000
By the way, if you have not yet been in my brother,

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
my brother, me appreciation group on Facebook,

41:30.000 --> 41:35.200
get there, get approved, and see the illustration

41:35.200 --> 41:37.760
that Lucas Williams created for thanks for vibing

41:37.760 --> 41:40.000
and keeping it tight if you need me, hit me up on my mobile.

41:40.000 --> 41:41.360
It's a baby talking into a cell phone.

41:41.360 --> 41:41.760
The baby's in it.

41:41.760 --> 41:42.560
It's pretty good stuff.

41:43.920 --> 41:46.880
The application process is, I'm not going to lie to you guys,

41:46.880 --> 41:47.840
it's pretty strenuous.

41:47.840 --> 41:49.120
I check how many groups you're in.

41:49.120 --> 41:50.720
I see if you're in any bullshit groups,

41:50.720 --> 41:52.800
and then I say, yeah, OK, you can come in.

41:52.800 --> 41:59.040
If you post shitty memes, or listen to my podcast,

41:59.680 --> 42:03.680
or degrading photographs, no thanks.

42:03.680 --> 42:04.800
We don't need you here.

42:04.800 --> 42:05.760
We don't need your services.

42:05.760 --> 42:07.040
Or try to sell jeans.

42:07.040 --> 42:08.720
Or try to sell jeans or sunglasses.

42:08.720 --> 42:10.720
A lot of people on there seem to sell jeans.

42:10.720 --> 42:12.960
Just come to the group and start selling jeans.

42:12.960 --> 42:16.000
If you're made of cyber bits, you are not welcome here.

42:16.000 --> 42:16.400
No thanks.

42:16.400 --> 42:17.440
No robits.

42:17.440 --> 42:18.400
I have a Yahoo answer.

42:18.400 --> 42:18.960
Do you guys want it?

42:18.960 --> 42:20.960
Wait, before we go on, if you would

42:20.960 --> 42:23.920
like to buy a Money Zone spot for someone you know.

42:23.920 --> 42:24.480
Or yourself.

42:25.200 --> 42:25.600
Yep.

42:25.600 --> 42:28.400
Just go to maximumfun.org forward slash jumbotron,

42:28.400 --> 42:30.640
and they're going to set you up for all that birthday messages.

42:30.640 --> 42:32.800
And if you have a website or a product

42:32.800 --> 42:36.560
that you want us to talk about and tell people to go check out,

42:36.560 --> 42:39.520
just go to maximumfun.org forward slash jumbotron.

42:39.520 --> 42:42.000
This is episode like 215.

42:42.000 --> 42:44.960
We've been with Max Fun since like episode 38.

42:44.960 --> 42:48.160
And I still get emails every week, like six or seven,

42:48.160 --> 42:50.560
that say, how do I get a Money Zone spot?

42:51.200 --> 42:53.520
Well, that's only because we're fucking terrible

42:53.520 --> 42:55.280
at telling people how to do anything.

42:55.280 --> 42:57.520
So I'm going to make sure I say it again.

42:57.520 --> 43:00.640
Maximumfun.org forward slash jumbotron.

43:00.640 --> 43:01.200
Thank you.

43:01.200 --> 43:01.680
I love you.

43:03.680 --> 43:04.160
Hi.

43:04.160 --> 43:05.120
My name's Dave.

43:05.120 --> 43:06.160
And my name's Graham.

43:06.160 --> 43:07.760
Now, what do we have to do to put you

43:07.760 --> 43:09.440
in a brand new podcast today?

43:09.440 --> 43:09.920
Yeah.

43:09.920 --> 43:11.280
What, do you want me to drink bleach?

43:11.840 --> 43:12.400
I'll do it.

43:12.400 --> 43:13.600
Yeah, Dave will drink bleach.

43:13.600 --> 43:15.360
If that's what it takes to get you to listen to,

43:15.360 --> 43:18.160
stop podcasting yourself on maximumfun.org.

43:18.160 --> 43:19.680
Don't make Dave drink bleach.

43:19.680 --> 43:21.120
Just listen to the show.

43:21.120 --> 43:22.560
He will, but don't make him.

43:22.560 --> 43:23.680
Stop podcasting yourself.

43:26.640 --> 43:28.880
Here's a Yahoo answer that was sent in by Alan Black.

43:28.880 --> 43:29.520
Thank you, Alan Black.

43:29.520 --> 43:32.160
It's by Yahoo Answers user Sass, who asks,

43:32.160 --> 43:35.440
is there a traffic ticket for sexting?

43:38.480 --> 43:39.600
Hypothetical question.

43:42.080 --> 43:42.720
That's it.

43:42.720 --> 43:43.840
It's hypothetical.

43:43.840 --> 43:48.000
It's fucking hypothetical until it's not anymore,

43:48.000 --> 43:49.040
until it's manifest.

43:49.040 --> 43:50.800
I'm confused by the parameters.

43:50.800 --> 43:53.680
Are they saying if someone sees you sexting

43:54.800 --> 43:57.040
while in a car in general?

43:57.040 --> 43:57.280
Yeah.

43:57.840 --> 44:00.000
Or is it like while driving?

44:00.000 --> 44:04.480
Because I feel like that falls under a different category.

44:04.480 --> 44:05.920
It varies from state to state, right?

44:05.920 --> 44:08.080
Could be if you're texting in your car no matter what.

44:08.080 --> 44:09.200
Yeah, you're fucked.

44:09.200 --> 44:11.520
If the car is at a stoplight, you're fine.

44:11.520 --> 44:14.080
Just don't move while you're texting or sexting.

44:14.080 --> 44:17.120
There was a whole 15 minute spot on Car Talk

44:17.120 --> 44:19.200
about not sexting while you drive.

44:19.200 --> 44:20.480
Is there fucking really?

44:20.480 --> 44:23.280
You could tell me not to move while sexting.

44:23.280 --> 44:25.600
You might as well tell the sun to stop shining.

44:25.600 --> 44:26.160
Yeah.

44:26.160 --> 44:28.480
I got to move till I find the exact right angle.

44:28.480 --> 44:29.760
I'm going to find my light.

44:29.760 --> 44:30.880
I'm going to find my angles.

44:30.880 --> 44:32.240
Going to model H2T.

44:32.240 --> 44:33.520
That is head to toe.

44:33.520 --> 44:34.880
I'm going to I'm going to booch.

44:36.240 --> 44:37.200
I'm going to smize.

44:37.760 --> 44:38.560
I can't sext.

44:38.560 --> 44:40.400
You're going to take a picture of my dick?

44:40.400 --> 44:41.520
No, do not do that.

44:41.520 --> 44:42.160
I'll take a picture of my dick and balls.

44:42.160 --> 44:42.800
No, no, no.

44:42.800 --> 44:43.680
You're not going to do that.

44:44.240 --> 44:45.680
You're not going to do that.

44:45.680 --> 44:48.080
Sexting I don't think involves dicks or balls.

44:48.080 --> 44:49.840
Okay, so maybe I'm just going to text like

44:50.480 --> 44:53.360
I'm going to use my wiener so good on you.

44:54.160 --> 44:54.720
So good.

44:54.720 --> 44:55.760
You're going to really enjoy it.

44:55.760 --> 44:56.960
This is pretty hot so far.

44:56.960 --> 44:59.280
I think you're going to thoroughly have a good time.

44:59.280 --> 45:01.280
Your comment card is going to be all fives.

45:02.160 --> 45:03.440
You're really going to enjoy it.

45:03.440 --> 45:06.480
Oh, God, a police officer pulls you over.

45:06.480 --> 45:07.040
Excuse me, sir.

45:07.040 --> 45:08.240
Were you texting while driving?

45:08.240 --> 45:09.280
Yeah, I'm sorry.

45:09.280 --> 45:13.760
I just, you know, I, I am too busy and like this message

45:13.760 --> 45:15.920
couldn't wait the four minutes that it was going to take for me

45:15.920 --> 45:17.920
to get to fucking super America.

45:17.920 --> 45:19.200
So I am sorry.

45:19.200 --> 45:20.160
I was texting while driving.

45:20.160 --> 45:21.520
I will take that ticket now.

45:21.520 --> 45:22.080
Hold on a second.

45:22.080 --> 45:25.360
Can I ask the subject matter of the text message of the SMS?

45:25.360 --> 45:29.440
Yes, it was, it was of a medical nature.

45:30.080 --> 45:30.800
Okay.

45:30.800 --> 45:32.400
I mean, as you go a little bit deeper.

45:32.400 --> 45:34.480
Was it about how good my wiener is?

45:34.480 --> 45:36.080
It was about how great my wiener is.

45:36.080 --> 45:36.320
Sorry.

45:36.320 --> 45:36.560
Sorry.

45:36.560 --> 45:38.080
I have to take you to double jail.

45:38.080 --> 45:41.920
You know, there's a new campaign to, but when you get into a car

45:41.920 --> 45:47.040
to text your friend hashtag X and to let them know you're driving.

45:47.040 --> 45:50.320
Hey, just to let everyone on my contact list know.

45:50.320 --> 45:52.960
Meemaw, Meeps, Peepaw, Peepums.

45:52.960 --> 45:53.360
Everybody.

45:53.360 --> 45:54.560
My hashtag X.

45:54.560 --> 45:56.960
My old landlord's wife.

45:57.760 --> 45:58.960
When I lived in Chicago.

46:00.080 --> 46:02.800
Do need you to know it's just hold off for just like 15 minutes

46:02.800 --> 46:04.080
till I get to the super America.

46:05.680 --> 46:07.600
Couldn't you just not look at your phone?

46:08.800 --> 46:09.680
Are you kidding?

46:09.680 --> 46:11.200
Have you met a 14 year old?

46:11.760 --> 46:11.920
No.

46:11.920 --> 46:14.400
A 14 year old who's driving and sexting.

46:14.400 --> 46:15.200
And he's drunk.

46:15.200 --> 46:15.200
Yeah.

46:15.200 --> 46:17.520
And he's drunk and high.

46:17.520 --> 46:18.720
We're in a blindfold.

46:18.720 --> 46:20.160
This kid is reckless.

46:21.280 --> 46:21.840
He's probably high.

46:21.840 --> 46:22.960
He's got a knife in his mouth.

46:22.960 --> 46:26.000
He's got a knife in his mouth and he's high because he lives in Boulder, Colorado.

46:26.000 --> 46:27.200
And he doesn't vote.

46:27.200 --> 46:30.000
He just complains about how it turns out afterwards.

46:30.560 --> 46:31.760
Motherfuckers never voted.

46:31.760 --> 46:34.320
And he's always high and he's driving and he's a danger to us.

46:34.320 --> 46:35.360
What's that in the back seat?

46:35.360 --> 46:36.400
It's a monkey.

46:36.400 --> 46:37.360
Wait, what?

46:37.360 --> 46:37.840
Where are we?

46:38.400 --> 46:39.920
There's a monkey in the back seat.

46:39.920 --> 46:42.640
Wait, is the monkey supposed to represent danger or awesome?

46:43.440 --> 46:45.120
Just the kid's back of the bone.

46:45.120 --> 46:49.040
Oh, maybe it's a helper monkey because the kid has no sense of judgment.

46:49.600 --> 46:50.080
Okay.

46:50.080 --> 46:51.920
The monkey's in the back going, I don't know about this kid.

46:51.920 --> 46:53.840
I don't know, Robbie.

46:53.840 --> 46:55.440
Maybe take the knife out of your mouth.

46:55.440 --> 46:56.640
Robbie, you should pull over.

46:56.640 --> 46:57.600
You should get on high.

46:57.600 --> 46:58.880
You should put the knife down.

46:58.880 --> 47:02.320
And you need to text your dad, your mom, and everyone you know, hashtag X.

47:04.000 --> 47:07.280
And maybe don't talk about your dick and balls when you talk to that nice girl.

47:07.280 --> 47:09.520
Well, nobody should fucking be sexting.

47:09.520 --> 47:13.920
You don't need me to fucking magic decision monkey to tell you to do that.

47:13.920 --> 47:15.040
Or a comedy podcast.

47:15.600 --> 47:17.200
Here's the more you know PSA.

47:17.200 --> 47:21.120
Don't send pictures of your privates to anyone or descriptions of your privates.

47:21.120 --> 47:24.480
That link, that's worse in a lot of ways, depending on how good you are at writing.

47:24.480 --> 47:25.760
Justin, go ahead with the next question.

47:26.320 --> 47:27.840
I work in a call center.

47:27.840 --> 47:31.040
Part of our job is asking the client if there's anything else we can do for them before hanging

47:31.040 --> 47:31.600
up.

47:31.600 --> 47:37.120
Maybe four or five times a day, someone will say, yeah, the winning Powerball numbers.

47:37.120 --> 47:37.620
What?

47:39.520 --> 47:41.280
That's crazy.

47:41.280 --> 47:43.840
Do you work at like a fortune telling place?

47:43.840 --> 47:45.440
I don't think you delivered it correctly.

47:45.440 --> 47:45.920
Let me try.

47:46.960 --> 47:47.600
Okay.

47:47.600 --> 47:50.080
Yeah, the winning Powerball numbers.

47:50.080 --> 47:51.520
Okay, that's funnier.

47:51.520 --> 47:52.720
That is better, actually.

47:52.720 --> 47:53.520
That is funnier.

47:54.400 --> 47:58.720
I know they're trying to be funny and nice, and I don't begrudge them.

47:58.720 --> 48:03.760
But after hearing that same joke, and there are actually four sets of quotation marks

48:03.760 --> 48:09.280
around joke, infinity times, I'm incapable of polite laughter and sit there like a weeping

48:09.280 --> 48:10.720
angel looking into a mirror.

48:10.720 --> 48:15.440
Are there any funny responses that you could help me add to my repertoire so that I don't

48:15.440 --> 48:18.160
feel like a humorless ass five times a day?

48:18.160 --> 48:23.200
Is there anything I can do to associate this terrible joke with a good one and make it

48:23.200 --> 48:24.000
funny?

48:24.000 --> 48:27.120
And that's from Fake Laugh Failure in Philadelphia.

48:27.120 --> 48:28.960
Here we go.

48:28.960 --> 48:29.680
Do you want it?

48:29.680 --> 48:30.880
First, let me say one thing.

48:30.880 --> 48:32.640
You only need one response.

48:32.640 --> 48:33.280
Really.

48:33.280 --> 48:36.720
I mean, you can have more in your quiver, but the person's not going to know.

48:36.720 --> 48:37.360
They're not going to know.

48:37.360 --> 48:40.080
They're not going to talk to Steven like, did you talk to that customer service person?

48:40.080 --> 48:41.440
Yeah, what'd they say to you?

48:41.440 --> 48:42.640
I did my great job.

48:42.640 --> 48:43.280
Fuck.

48:43.280 --> 48:43.920
Quick question.

48:43.920 --> 48:49.360
Do you want it to be funny to them or funny to you?

48:49.360 --> 48:51.440
You're trying to re-yuck a yuckster?

48:51.440 --> 48:52.160
No, no, no.

48:52.160 --> 48:52.720
I'm saying like-

48:52.720 --> 48:59.760
I think Travis is pointing out one of the sort of, one of the facts of growing up is

48:59.760 --> 49:07.680
that you tend to, you learn to treasure jokes that aren't exactly funny, but are serviceable

49:07.680 --> 49:09.840
and make sense and can get you out of a conversation.

49:09.840 --> 49:12.160
Because I'm going to tell you, here's the thing.

49:12.160 --> 49:15.840
As someone who's worked customer service and had to deal with these people at work,

49:15.840 --> 49:17.840
they're not trying to be funny.

49:17.840 --> 49:22.080
They're using this like a fill in the blank, drop it in so they feel like they've had

49:22.080 --> 49:23.920
some kind of interaction with you.

49:23.920 --> 49:29.360
This is like a thing they say when they can't think of something to say, like, how you doing?

49:29.360 --> 49:31.360
You know, oh, weather, huh?

49:31.360 --> 49:31.840
You know what I mean?

49:31.840 --> 49:33.280
This is just a filler thing.

49:33.280 --> 49:37.920
You are trying to normalize the behavior of fucking space aliens, Travis, because the

49:37.920 --> 49:40.800
normal thing that you say when someone says, can I help you with anything?

49:40.800 --> 49:43.120
When someone says, can I help you with anything else is no.

49:43.120 --> 49:43.520
Thank you.

49:43.520 --> 49:44.160
Goodbye.

49:44.160 --> 49:44.880
Great service.

49:46.320 --> 49:47.520
You don't even say that last part.

49:47.520 --> 49:48.240
You don't even say no.

49:48.240 --> 49:48.880
Thank you.

49:48.880 --> 49:51.600
You say bye and you hang up the fucking phone.

49:52.320 --> 49:55.280
Sometimes you say bye because you're talking to a human automaton.

49:55.280 --> 49:56.640
Is the transaction over?

49:56.640 --> 49:59.760
Can I can I detect that you were trying to wrap this conversation up?

49:59.760 --> 50:03.040
I'm going to save us both a lot of time and just end.

50:03.040 --> 50:04.160
Just cut the line.

50:05.200 --> 50:05.840
All right.

50:05.840 --> 50:06.240
All right.

50:06.240 --> 50:08.880
Let's think of some not funny.

50:08.880 --> 50:09.520
Okay.

50:09.520 --> 50:11.280
But serviceable answers.

50:12.000 --> 50:13.600
Let me throw one out just to get things started.

50:15.520 --> 50:17.200
There's a three in there somewhere.

50:17.200 --> 50:19.120
That's all I'm allowed to say.

50:19.120 --> 50:19.840
I like that.

50:24.960 --> 50:25.840
Let me throw this out.

50:27.200 --> 50:32.400
Travis, I swear to God, if you say, I'm going to start taxing you.

50:32.400 --> 50:33.520
There'll be a tax.

50:33.520 --> 50:34.560
You're going to get a bill.

50:34.560 --> 50:35.680
Where's this bill come from?

50:37.200 --> 50:38.560
Try this one on for size.

50:38.560 --> 50:41.200
Oh, fuck.

50:41.200 --> 50:42.960
Put this in your pipe and smirk it.

50:44.400 --> 50:44.640
Okay.

50:46.480 --> 50:48.480
Okay, Justin, you give me the Powerball line.

50:48.480 --> 50:50.240
Nothing on my sleeve this time for sure.

50:50.240 --> 50:51.360
Why'd you try that?

50:51.360 --> 50:52.800
Okay, Justin, give me the Powerball line.

50:54.560 --> 50:55.120
Yeah.

50:55.120 --> 50:56.800
The winning Powerball numbers.

50:56.800 --> 50:59.520
Well, I'd love to, but I'd get fired.

51:01.120 --> 51:01.440
Wow.

51:01.440 --> 51:03.600
That fucking gave me the douchiest chills.

51:04.480 --> 51:04.800
Fuck.

51:04.800 --> 51:05.760
Okay, wait, hold on.

51:05.760 --> 51:06.080
Try it.

51:06.080 --> 51:06.960
Can I try one out?

51:06.960 --> 51:07.520
You both did one.

51:07.520 --> 51:08.320
Let me try one.

51:08.320 --> 51:08.880
Okay.

51:08.880 --> 51:10.960
Travis, you do the prompt for me this time.

51:10.960 --> 51:11.600
Yeah.

51:11.600 --> 51:13.520
The winning Powerball numbers.

51:13.520 --> 51:14.480
69.

51:17.920 --> 51:19.040
You make a vigorous blow job.

51:21.840 --> 51:23.360
Okay, Justin, give me a line again.

51:24.400 --> 51:24.720
Yeah.

51:24.720 --> 51:26.560
The winning Powerball numbers.

51:26.560 --> 51:32.720
Six, 17, 23, 38, six, five.

51:33.520 --> 51:34.000
Oh God.

51:34.000 --> 51:34.720
What just happened?

51:35.680 --> 51:36.880
And then you hang up the phone.

51:36.880 --> 51:38.000
Travis, give me the line.

51:38.000 --> 51:38.560
Okay.

51:38.560 --> 51:38.800
Yeah.

51:38.800 --> 51:40.240
The winning Powerball numbers.

51:40.960 --> 51:42.960
36, 24, 33.

51:44.000 --> 51:46.480
Maybe she's Sir Mixalot's girlfriend.

51:49.440 --> 51:50.560
Kids, Justin, give it to me.

51:51.920 --> 51:52.240
Yeah.

51:52.240 --> 51:53.520
The winning Powerball numbers.

51:53.520 --> 51:55.680
Sir, I have a lot of people to get through today.

51:55.680 --> 51:57.200
Do you need anything or don't you?

51:59.040 --> 51:59.680
Yeah.

51:59.680 --> 52:01.200
The winning Powerball numbers.

52:01.200 --> 52:01.520
Please.

52:01.520 --> 52:02.720
I need some escape.

52:02.720 --> 52:04.560
I need an escape hatch for this life.

52:04.560 --> 52:08.000
This prison life that I've constructed for myself around myself.

52:08.000 --> 52:09.920
My family and I are so destitute.

52:09.920 --> 52:11.280
I've been out of work for six months.

52:11.920 --> 52:14.720
That's why I called the Butterball hotline.

52:14.720 --> 52:16.800
It sounds like I'm hanging on by a thread here.

52:16.800 --> 52:18.400
Sounds like you're in dire straits.

52:18.400 --> 52:19.440
So 69.

52:25.280 --> 52:27.040
I'll get you out a lot of workplace pickles.

52:27.920 --> 52:29.520
Get you out a lot of workplaces.

52:29.520 --> 52:30.240
Yeah, that too.

52:32.160 --> 52:32.880
Get fired.

52:32.880 --> 52:33.600
Let's end the show.

52:33.600 --> 52:34.160
Yeah.

52:34.160 --> 52:35.200
Yeah, we're done.

52:35.200 --> 52:38.640
Hey, thank you all so much for listening to My Brother, My Brother, Me.

52:38.640 --> 52:42.160
I sure missed doing this with my brothers.

52:42.880 --> 52:48.160
And I miss seeing all you all and hanging out with you all.

52:48.160 --> 52:51.840
And I'm certainly glad to be back.

52:51.840 --> 52:55.040
So thank you for listening to our show again.

52:55.040 --> 52:59.280
Thank you to people tweeting about our show like Kyle Starr, Peter Alan Boyle, Rich Wilson,

52:59.280 --> 53:08.400
Todd Hauser, Steve, JB, Paul Briner, David Lasky, Rocket Man, Sam Dean, Lynn Bravo Alpha,

53:08.400 --> 53:12.800
Rocket Man again, Mia, Dan Hendrickson, so many others.

53:12.800 --> 53:15.520
We're at NBNBAM on Twitter.

53:16.160 --> 53:20.800
So you can just follow us there and tweet at us using the NBNBAM hashtag.

53:22.160 --> 53:23.040
That'd be great.

53:23.040 --> 53:27.200
And thanks for all the nice feedback about the Adventure Zone.

53:27.200 --> 53:27.680
Yep.

53:27.680 --> 53:28.560
D&D episode.

53:28.560 --> 53:29.360
We're out.

53:29.360 --> 53:29.840
We're fit.

53:29.840 --> 53:33.600
We had a lot of people asking if we're going to release the rest of it.

53:33.600 --> 53:34.960
Like that was all that we've played.

53:34.960 --> 53:40.880
But we are figuring out what doing more of that looks like in a podcast.

53:40.880 --> 53:42.240
Not this podcast.

53:42.240 --> 53:43.200
But maybe another one.

53:45.120 --> 53:48.320
Speaking of other podcasts, if you enjoyed this podcast and you haven't listened to the

53:48.320 --> 53:50.160
other Maximum podcast, you are cool.

53:51.040 --> 53:51.920
There's tons of them.

53:51.920 --> 53:54.320
I'm not going to try to list all of them because there's way too many.

53:54.320 --> 54:00.000
But I just saw on Twitter that Lady2Lady just recorded an episode with French Stewart.

54:00.560 --> 54:04.720
Oh, don't tell people that because then they're going to try and fucking shame us

54:04.720 --> 54:06.640
because we were horrible to French Stewart.

54:06.640 --> 54:07.440
We were not.

54:07.440 --> 54:08.560
It was all in fun.

54:08.560 --> 54:09.280
It was all-

54:09.280 --> 54:10.880
It was not in fun or in jest.

54:10.880 --> 54:13.200
We were fucking horrible to French Stewart.

54:14.640 --> 54:18.240
In our defense, those were in the days when we couldn't imagine anyone would ever listen

54:18.240 --> 54:18.880
to our show.

54:18.880 --> 54:19.200
Correct.

54:19.200 --> 54:21.760
That was not as long ago as I think you guys think it was.

54:21.760 --> 54:25.360
That was like 199.

54:25.360 --> 54:26.640
I'm sorry, French Stewart.

54:27.760 --> 54:28.960
We're fucking growing.

54:28.960 --> 54:33.200
We're learning that when we say things about human beings, sometimes those human beings

54:33.200 --> 54:36.000
can ostensibly hear what we say and it hurts them.

54:36.000 --> 54:36.640
It would hurt me.

54:38.240 --> 54:40.560
So go check out the other Maximum podcast.

54:43.360 --> 54:44.480
Yeah, please do.

54:44.480 --> 54:45.120
They're really great.

54:45.120 --> 54:46.640
And thanks to Maximum Fun for having us.

54:47.440 --> 54:47.920
We love you guys.

54:47.920 --> 54:48.560
Yeah, I really-

54:49.200 --> 54:50.880
It's a constant joy.

54:50.880 --> 54:53.760
I want to thank John Roderick, too, and The Long Winters, as long as we're thanking people

54:54.480 --> 54:55.680
for the use of our theme song.

54:55.680 --> 54:58.400
It's a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

54:59.280 --> 55:00.400
It's a great album.

55:00.400 --> 55:03.040
I was listening to it on the record player earlier today.

55:03.040 --> 55:08.000
I played it backwards and I heard John Roderick's dark regards.

55:10.720 --> 55:12.320
You guys want the final yahoo?

55:12.320 --> 55:12.800
Yeah, hit me.

55:12.800 --> 55:14.880
This final yahoo was sent in by Drew Davenport.

55:14.880 --> 55:15.680
It's a yeah, Drew.

55:15.680 --> 55:20.640
Uh, this yahoo user, Steven, asks,

55:23.280 --> 55:27.280
What is the best moisture of all to use for lovemaking?

55:27.280 --> 55:28.080
Oh, golly.

55:28.080 --> 55:28.960
I'm Justin McElroy.

55:28.960 --> 55:30.000
And I'm Travis McElroy.

55:30.000 --> 55:31.440
I'm Griffin McElroy.

55:31.440 --> 55:32.640
It's been my brother, my brother and me.

55:32.640 --> 55:33.360
Kiss your dad.

55:33.360 --> 55:52.000

Every Tuesday, we bring you Sawbones, a marital tour

56:07.200 --> 56:11.360
of Misguided Medicine, a show about all the dumb, weird,

56:11.360 --> 56:14.160
terrible ways that we've tried to fix each other over the years.

56:14.160 --> 56:16.400
You know, some light summer listening.

56:16.400 --> 56:18.400
Maybe you want to hear about yogurt enemas

56:18.400 --> 56:21.040
or why we tried to eat mummies for a while

56:21.040 --> 56:24.560
or why drinking cholera diarrhea sounded like a good idea.

56:24.560 --> 56:27.840
That and so much more is waiting for you every Tuesday

56:27.840 --> 56:30.720
right here on the Maximum Fun Network

56:30.720 --> 56:35.600
with Sawbones, a marital tour of Misguided Medicine.
