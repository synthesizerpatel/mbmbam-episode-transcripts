00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:48.000
Hello and welcome to my brother, my brother meat advice show for the modern era. What a

00:48.000 --> 00:51.360
thrill it is to be back. My name is Justin McElroy. I'm your oldest brother. I'm your

00:51.360 --> 01:00.320
middle brother, Travis McElroy, and I'm the nasty man. Hey guys, it's me, the nasty man.

01:00.320 --> 01:03.280
Is nasty man a 30 under 30 media luminary?

01:03.280 --> 01:06.880
Yeah, the nasty man, they didn't take that away. When I became nasty man,

01:06.880 --> 01:10.480
I emailed Forbes just as a courtesy, like, hey, are you going to strip my title? You're

01:10.480 --> 01:14.960
going to put an asterisk up there. Are you going to lower my banner and burn it in the

01:14.960 --> 01:18.960
ceremonial fire? And they said, no nasty man. And I thought that was sweet that they did call me

01:18.960 --> 01:23.600
the new name. They said, no nasty man, you can stay on the list. And they updated the website.

01:23.600 --> 01:25.680
So now it says the nasty man.

01:25.680 --> 01:31.440
It actually says Griffin McElroy, and it's all the same. And there's a huge asterisk. I mean,

01:31.440 --> 01:40.240
like comically huge asterisk. And it says, just a fair warning, ladies and germs. He's a nasty man.

01:40.240 --> 01:42.160
Yeah. And it says germs in like,

01:43.120 --> 01:49.120
comic sans to let you know that that part is in fact kind of a joke because I got the bronchitis

01:49.120 --> 01:57.840
gang. I got it deep down, down, deep in my lungs. Hey, deep in my lungs. And it's bad. And did you

01:57.840 --> 02:04.720
know that when you are a professional podcaster, you really just can't get bronchitis? It's like,

02:06.000 --> 02:12.240
you're really not supposed to do it. And so when I saw the big bronchitis hose

02:13.120 --> 02:16.480
hanging off of that abandoned warehouse, and I was like, I'm gonna take a huff on that.

02:16.480 --> 02:22.640
I should have known that it would have been a mistake. But I didn't, in curiosity,

02:22.640 --> 02:28.240
made the cat get bronchitis. It's funny. I've been on a course. My wife got,

02:29.760 --> 02:35.840
she has a name at Sydney. My wife got the flu because she works at the flu store,

02:36.400 --> 02:42.480
pretty much. And she got the flu and she brought it home. So I went on a prophylactic dose of

02:42.480 --> 02:46.480
Tamiflu. So I was taking one Tamiflu a day. And that's very funny. Like we should talk about the

02:46.480 --> 02:51.120
fact that it does sound like you're talking about a rubber or a Jimmy cap. It is hysterical. Yeah.

02:51.920 --> 02:57.920
So I'm taking that. And it's the closest I've ever had to having a superpower. Like I'm just

02:57.920 --> 03:03.360
wandering around town. I see a sick person and I run up and I embrace them. Yeah. Like,

03:03.360 --> 03:08.640
because they haven't had touch. I would love a big embrace right now. I of course ask consent

03:08.640 --> 03:13.120
first. And then I give them a huge bear hug. I just say like, it's going to be okay. And they're

03:13.120 --> 03:20.400
like, but Justin, no, don't. And then I'm like, it's fine. It's fine. I also have like a sinus

03:20.400 --> 03:26.160
infection, which is really cool. And what's really cool and is cool about it is that right now,

03:26.160 --> 03:33.760
I don't know, 15 minutes ago, took my cough syrup that did have codeine in it. And I did take a

03:33.760 --> 03:40.240
Sudafed, the max strength 24 hours one, because I do not fuck around. That real Welter White shit.

03:40.240 --> 03:49.760
And so my brain isn't one. For the most part, the two lobes are like the left side's team codeine.

03:49.760 --> 03:54.960
And it's like, let's just chill. And the right side is team Sudafed. And it's like, yeah, that

03:54.960 --> 04:00.640
sounds pretty good. And so I'm excited for what the nasty man is going to bring to this episode.

04:00.640 --> 04:06.480
Travis, how's your health? Oh, my health is great. I'm recording this from a hotel room in San

04:06.480 --> 04:13.200
Francisco for San Francisco Sketch Fest. Got any lotions? What? Lotions. Do you have them from the

04:13.200 --> 04:19.040
hotel? Oh, yes. I'm going to steal those lotions. My voice is a little rough, but not from sickness,

04:19.040 --> 04:25.520
just from just laughing and screaming in joy. Well, I'm glad to hear that, Trav. You big

04:25.520 --> 04:31.120
shithead. Well, I also have something so important to tell everyone, Griffin. Lean in. Everybody lean

04:31.120 --> 04:38.400
in. You don't want me that close to you, bud. The hotel room I'm in is 420. No. No, you did it.

04:38.400 --> 04:44.400
It's the dream. I did it. I'm in the lead number. I live in it now. What was your exact reaction when

04:44.400 --> 04:50.240
they told you? I think I just kept saying, really? Really? Like a child who had just come downstairs

04:50.240 --> 04:56.080
on Christmas to find an Ewok Village playset below the tree. How many people at the Sketch

04:56.080 --> 05:04.240
Fest did you find an excuse to tell your hotel room? But in a not creepy way. Everyone was very

05:04.240 --> 05:10.800
jealous, legitimately. I think just because I'm here with so many stand-up comics and performers

05:10.800 --> 05:16.080
who are like, and you know they love weed. Yeah. And not only that, but if I had the go-to punch

05:16.080 --> 05:23.120
line of I'm in the weed number, they would use it. But here I am using it on my recorded,

05:23.120 --> 05:27.120
whimsical podcast with my brother and my brother and me. Yeah, I mean, it's a sure-fire hit. I

05:27.120 --> 05:32.160
don't know if you can tell from our response, just like busting chucklenuts over here, but

05:33.200 --> 05:37.280
it's a sure-fire. Really? They use that number? You know, the weed one? I would think it would be

05:37.280 --> 05:42.640
like the 13th floor. Yes, when they skip the 13th floor, you think they would do that and it's like,

05:42.640 --> 05:49.360
we can't put the weed number in here? Yeah. That's too funny. Anyway, so this is gonna be a real

05:49.360 --> 05:55.200
episode of content. So should we do that? Yeah, I mean, yeah, for sure. Nobody's gonna say by the

05:55.200 --> 05:59.840
time they get to the end of the episode, they won't be able to say, well, that wasn't an episode

05:59.840 --> 06:04.720
of a podcast. I think it'll be pretty undeniable that what we've done here is put together a real

06:04.720 --> 06:13.440
podcast episode in terms of content. Yeah. My wife and I recently moved to Michigan. My wife!

06:13.440 --> 06:19.280
Okay, nasty man. My wife and I recently moved to Michigan where it is very cold in the wintertime.

06:19.280 --> 06:26.000
Heard that. Shut up. To keep warm, my wife made a sweat dress, which is a full-length dress made

06:26.000 --> 06:32.560
entirely of the material used to make sweatshirts and sweatpants. It's very warm, but we're not sure

06:32.560 --> 06:37.280
whether it is appropriate to wear to work. Is my wife's new gray sweat dress appropriate work

06:37.280 --> 06:44.560
attire or is it just a pajama dress? And that's Andrew from Ann Arbor. Last night, because of all

06:44.560 --> 06:49.360
the football that happened, and it was apparently very good football. Yeah, a lot, TDs all over the

06:49.360 --> 06:55.600
place. I heard at least eight teams get mentioned, which seemed wild to me. Yeah, and because of the

06:55.600 --> 07:01.200
football, everything on all the channels was delayed like a half hour. And so that's why I

07:01.200 --> 07:07.840
was accidentally watching Shark Tank. And Juicy watches that. I know you like to get up. I watch

07:07.840 --> 07:12.880
every app, baby. You swim with the fishes. There was a gentleman who pitched a product there,

07:12.880 --> 07:18.240
and fuck me, I guess it worked because here we are mentioning it on our nationally syndicated

07:18.240 --> 07:23.040
podcast. Which, by the way, I'm so glad we finally got syndication. You know, that's where the money

07:23.040 --> 07:29.840
is. There was a gentleman who pitched a product that was called Dude Robe, and it was kind of this.

07:29.840 --> 07:38.800
It was sort of like fleece lined robe hoodie line, and it was called Dude Robe, which I thought was

07:38.800 --> 07:44.400
not inclusive in the way that I like my products to be. It sounds like you kind of have developed

07:46.160 --> 07:50.720
an alternative to Dude Robe, and I'm very much into that. Now, I will say the Sharks did pass

07:50.720 --> 07:56.000
on Dude Robe. So if you're looking for sort of commercial viability of your new product,

07:56.000 --> 08:01.040
and if their acumen is to be trusted, I don't think there's much of a profit future for you.

08:02.160 --> 08:07.840
Is it appropriate to wear to work? I mean, is it the material or the cut?

08:07.840 --> 08:18.400
Yeah, the cut is so important. Is it a, you know, a, I know nothing about dresses. Oops. Cocktail

08:18.400 --> 08:23.840
dress, you know, that's one. Wedding is another. Yeah, that's another. I don't think it's a wedding

08:23.840 --> 08:30.080
dress, although I would be very into that sort of casual approach. Dude, a pajamas wedding, please

08:30.720 --> 08:36.880
hook me up. If I'm staying up past, you know, 11 anyway, then I would love to just be in my off

08:36.880 --> 08:43.280
court buddies ready for this sack. I love your ingenuity here, your wife's ingenuity here though.

08:44.240 --> 08:49.600
I think this could really take off. You think it's not about whether or not, here's the thing.

08:49.600 --> 08:55.680
Don't wear it to work because your new job is sweat dress. Yeah. Your new job is promoting

08:55.680 --> 09:02.880
and selling this apparently commercially unviable product, and I'm a little worried about that.

09:02.880 --> 09:10.320
The real issue is that this gentleman wanted $220 for each dude robe, which seems like a lot,

09:10.320 --> 09:15.520
sir. Yeah, I'm not going to pay that much for, I wouldn't pay $10 for a product if it was called

09:15.520 --> 09:21.520
dude robe. If it was just called- Dude anything. Dude anything is a tough putt. Dude repellent,

09:21.520 --> 09:26.400
maybe I would buy that. Yeah. I will also say, Andrew, you and your wife, I think,

09:26.400 --> 09:32.640
need to do a little brainstorming because I think maybe sweat dress doesn't trip off the tongue.

09:32.640 --> 09:36.640
So I was going to say this, Travis, and then I started thinking, if you think about it,

09:37.520 --> 09:44.560
sweatpants is like, that's gross. It's really gross. But that's established at this point.

09:44.560 --> 09:48.400
It's a little late for us to change sweatpants and sweatshirts. It's established, but it's like,

09:48.400 --> 09:51.360
if you think about it for just a second, and that's what we're all about here,

09:51.360 --> 09:56.480
I'm your brother, my brother and me, sort of like deeper, like diving deeper into

09:56.480 --> 10:02.160
the things that we just sort of pass by. Sweatpants. That's gross.

10:02.880 --> 10:07.280
Yeah, it sounds like some sort of rag you would use for cleaning, and that's why it is the nasty

10:07.280 --> 10:17.600
man's favorite sort of garment. I love this though. Can you just staple on a normal dress fabric to

10:17.600 --> 10:23.600
the outside of it, and then it's your dark secret? And if the answer is yes, then my follow-up

10:23.600 --> 10:28.240
question is, can you come to my house and do that to literally every piece of clothing that I own?

10:28.240 --> 10:34.960
Because yes, well, sweatpants is a nasty word. It's the one you want to be wearing.

10:34.960 --> 10:42.240
What about some embroidery or maybe some bedazzling could happen there to sort of kick

10:42.240 --> 10:48.720
it up a little bit so you keep the comfort factor, but it's also like a little, like maybe you use

10:48.720 --> 10:54.160
gemstones to write the word fancy on it. And that's how you know a clothes is

10:54.160 --> 10:58.480
fancy, Justin. And I'm glad you brought this up. That's why at the Met Gala,

10:58.480 --> 11:04.320
it's fancy, fancy. It's like Juice Newton all up in that place. Speaking of the Met Gala,

11:04.320 --> 11:07.600
maybe we just get Heidi wearing one of these things.

11:07.600 --> 11:12.640
I need to stop for a second and figure out why you said the words Juice Newton a second ago.

11:12.640 --> 11:16.720
I also was wondering this. No, don't help him.

11:18.880 --> 11:25.200
What was Juice Newton's sort of contribution? Was it a phonetic sort of fun you were having,

11:25.200 --> 11:30.240
or was there a deeper level that maybe just kind of whizzed over my head? What was sort of the idea

11:30.240 --> 11:34.560
with saying that? And I guess the real question that's on the tips of everyone's lips is that

11:34.560 --> 11:42.160
I confused Juice Newton and Reba McEntire. Okay, she did fancy. Okay. Yes. Yes. See?

11:42.160 --> 11:46.400
Thank you, Nasty Man. We got inside the bit. So happy to finally have that one.

11:46.400 --> 11:49.920
What was Juice Newton's jam? Juice Newton's jam.

11:51.440 --> 11:57.760
I just Googled Juice Newton's jam. Guys, should we delay the episode recording of the podcast?

11:57.760 --> 12:04.240
Juice Newton, best song. Queen of Hearts. Playing with the Queen of Hearts. That one was what I was

12:04.240 --> 12:08.480
thinking of. Anyway, you guys want to Yahoo? Sure, yeah.

12:09.040 --> 12:11.520
Juice Newton's a very talented performer. You bet.

12:11.520 --> 12:16.320
And this is a very talented Yahoo that was sent in by the delivery man Seth Carlson. Thank you,

12:16.320 --> 12:26.240
Seth. It's Yahoo Answers user Skyler asks, can a ghost charge a phone? Asking because people who

12:26.240 --> 12:30.080
live to my house claim we have a ghost here. I usually charge my phone with a wireless charger.

12:30.080 --> 12:33.920
So I get notification when I place it on the charger. I was standing in the doorway of the

12:33.920 --> 12:39.920
room where the ghost resides and that's in quotes. And suddenly and randomly I get a pop up about my

12:39.920 --> 12:45.280
phone connected to the wireless charger and then phase as it detects the charger is off. However,

12:45.280 --> 12:50.880
my phone was in my hands as I was browsing the net. Or this is a real person by the way,

12:50.880 --> 12:55.280
and they did say browsing the net. Did a ghost energy charge my phone as it walked by?

12:55.280 --> 13:01.680
Or is it just weird technical malfunction? Well, of the two, I think you've got to lean ghosts

13:01.680 --> 13:08.160
on this one if you're applying a skeptical eye. I mean, those electronics cost a lot of money

13:08.160 --> 13:14.960
and it seems weird that they would just malfunction. I remember watching the movie Contact but only

13:14.960 --> 13:19.600
kind of watching it and there was a whole bit in there about Occam's razor and I wasn't paying

13:19.600 --> 13:25.440
and I wasn't paying attention to it. But I think what it meant is that the ghost did charge the

13:25.440 --> 13:33.760
phone in this one. And can I say what a friendly specter that would like? I would want that specter.

13:33.760 --> 13:38.000
I would want to, you know, maybe not murder somebody in a terrible passion, which is how

13:38.560 --> 13:43.440
ghosts get born. But I will say like there have been times where I've been at like a music festival

13:44.160 --> 13:47.840
or at the airport and I forgot to charge my phone where I could use a little,

13:47.840 --> 13:53.520
you know, a little Casper floating around my Samsung and making sure that it gets juiced up.

13:53.520 --> 13:59.520
Now that brings up a question though. Is it platform agnostic? Are there certain ghouls

13:59.520 --> 14:05.200
that charge Samsung devices? Are there certain geists that charge Apple devices?

14:05.200 --> 14:11.120
I mean, I think the key here was introducing wireless charging because ghosts are wireless.

14:11.120 --> 14:14.640
So they hear that and they're like, well, I can fuck with that for sure.

14:14.640 --> 14:19.920
I mean, it's not old, not old ghosts, though. Old ghosts have sort of an they got sort of

14:19.920 --> 14:23.840
an iron lung situation where they do need to be plugged into the wall to go.

14:24.880 --> 14:26.080
Can you imagine being a ghost?

14:26.080 --> 14:29.520
That's why a lot of times, you know, you'll be watching Ghost Adventures and they'll be like,

14:29.520 --> 14:34.000
oh, see that extension cord just kind of whipping around. That's an old, old ghost.

14:35.200 --> 14:40.160
Can you imagine the frustration of being a ghost who like you have been charging

14:40.160 --> 14:44.800
someone's phone for them and then they come home and like Apple has changed like the

14:44.800 --> 14:49.840
charging outlet on the phone and you're like, oh, what? But I'm not I'm not compatible with

14:49.840 --> 14:50.640
lightning chargers.

14:51.280 --> 14:53.600
Fucking Joni. What am I supposed to do now?

14:54.240 --> 14:55.840
I'm just going to knock over some dishes.

14:57.440 --> 14:58.160
Stinker.

14:59.120 --> 15:03.120
What? Stinker. I'm going to smash dishes till you get a new Samsung.

15:03.840 --> 15:09.680
I love the Samsung devices. It's more open platform. Don't give Tim any more money.

15:09.680 --> 15:10.240
Tim Cook.

15:11.120 --> 15:14.000
Ghosts are more compatible with the Samsung platform.

15:14.000 --> 15:18.400
It's just the frickin truth, people, because Tim locks it up so you can't play all your,

15:18.400 --> 15:20.400
you know, emulators and stuff.

15:21.040 --> 15:22.320
Ghosts can't get in it.

15:22.320 --> 15:23.760
Ghosts can't get in it.

15:23.760 --> 15:27.440
This was definitely a good spectral activity. I don't know what else to say.

15:27.440 --> 15:30.960
I'm so convinced of it now. It was. Yeah, it wasn't a fluke.

15:30.960 --> 15:34.880
This is a dead person that got in there and helped you out with a few extra percentage

15:34.880 --> 15:36.400
points that you need to get through the day.

15:36.400 --> 15:41.200
Hey, it's bad enough that Tim made it waterproof, so no squished ghosts can get into it.

15:41.200 --> 15:45.200
Like, all the wet ghosts that are around, they can't get into your phone at all.

15:45.200 --> 15:50.080
What if they need to get in there to help solve a crime for some well-meaning neighborhood kids?

15:50.080 --> 15:51.360
They can't get in it.

15:51.360 --> 15:53.600
What if Ghost Rider got on your phone and was like,

15:53.600 --> 15:56.560
Jesus Christ, there's a lot of pornography on here.

15:56.560 --> 15:59.920
I don't actually want to help with this anymore.

15:59.920 --> 16:05.200
Why is the symbol for Waze a ghost? This is just a thing I've always wondered.

16:05.200 --> 16:11.600
The app Waze, the little icon is a ghost with wheels? Never understood it.

16:11.600 --> 16:14.080
Is that an app with a ghost in it? It used to be that way.

16:14.080 --> 16:17.440
No, it was a car. And they're freaking ghosts.

16:17.440 --> 16:21.120
Did the car crash and turn into a ghost? Another possibility.

16:22.880 --> 16:24.240
Do cars have ghosts?

16:25.040 --> 16:29.600
We can't even start to bust into that one, but yes, especially Teslas.

16:29.600 --> 16:33.280
All-electric hybrid cars? Extremely haunted.

16:33.280 --> 16:38.320
Extremely haunted, but that's how you get to drive from San Francisco to Phoenix on one charge.

16:38.320 --> 16:42.800
You have four or five ghosts sort of pit crewing you there inside the trunk of the one.

16:42.800 --> 16:47.760
So here's my question. I'm walking around my everyday life, then I die.

16:48.400 --> 16:48.900
No.

16:50.000 --> 16:55.680
I know, but in a terrible fashion with lots of unfinished business, and I become a ghost.

16:55.680 --> 16:59.680
So my question is, does that mean that now, right now, sitting here,

16:59.680 --> 17:03.680
I have a ghost inside me, and so everyone is haunted?

17:03.680 --> 17:07.920
Oh, wow. And now we've got to it, folks.

17:08.480 --> 17:12.640
300-some episodes in. The big philosophical one.

17:13.280 --> 17:16.320
Is all of us haunted with a literal ghost inside of us,

17:16.320 --> 17:19.520
just waiting to jump out and do a scare when we die?

17:21.280 --> 17:25.360
The answer is probably. The answer is probably.

17:25.360 --> 17:28.960
All the great theologians and philosophers throughout time agree.

17:28.960 --> 17:35.840
Descartes, the other ones agree. There's definitely a little ghost in there.

17:35.840 --> 17:36.480
Is it scary?

17:36.480 --> 17:39.040
Is it definitely or probably? Is it probably or definitely?

17:39.040 --> 17:39.840
Yeah, probably.

17:40.880 --> 17:43.360
That's why on Descartes' deathbed, he was like,

17:43.360 --> 17:47.440
here it probably comes, and then he died, and then a ghost probably came out.

17:49.520 --> 17:54.880
Okay, Griffin, with all due respect, that's all nonsense and hogwashing bullshit.

17:54.880 --> 17:58.960
Ghosts are not piloting our bodies.

17:58.960 --> 18:05.360
Ghosts are created from somebody dying in a terrible passion.

18:06.080 --> 18:12.560
So you don't, you don't automa- it's like a chemical, you know, with eggs.

18:14.720 --> 18:17.520
Like, if you have an- imagine an egg.

18:17.520 --> 18:20.320
Okay, wait, give me a second. Give me a second. Let me get there.

18:20.320 --> 18:21.680
Let me imagine an egg. Hold on.

18:22.480 --> 18:22.980
Yum!

18:22.980 --> 18:23.940
Yum!

18:23.940 --> 18:26.420
Okay, imagine an egg, okay?

18:26.420 --> 18:27.300
Uh-huh.

18:27.300 --> 18:30.820
Wait, hold on. Am I still imagining the first egg or am I imagining a second egg?

18:30.820 --> 18:32.580
So this is the same egg, okay?

18:32.580 --> 18:33.620
Mmm, yummy!

18:34.740 --> 18:38.660
You crack the egg and crack it into a bowl, okay?

18:38.660 --> 18:41.540
Oh, I'm sorry. I was picturing a hard-boiled egg. Can we start over?

18:41.540 --> 18:42.020
Can we start over?

18:42.020 --> 18:45.220
Yeah, start over. Go get a fresh one. Bring it back out, okay?

18:45.220 --> 18:48.020
What should I do with this- what should I do with this fucking first egg, though?

18:48.020 --> 18:49.620
Because I can't just have a bunch of eggs rattle around my brain.

18:49.620 --> 18:52.820
You keep your egg. Your egg was fresh and organic.

18:52.820 --> 18:54.580
So keep your egg. Travis has got a new one.

18:54.580 --> 18:56.340
Mine's a turtle egg. Should I have said that?

18:57.460 --> 18:59.540
Any egg is fine. Let's say it's a chicken egg.

18:59.540 --> 19:00.820
Any egg will do.

19:02.180 --> 19:05.700
Okay, so crack the egg into a bowl.

19:05.700 --> 19:07.220
Slow down, slow down.

19:07.220 --> 19:09.140
Justin, Baby Turtle came out!

19:09.140 --> 19:10.020
Is this the analogy?

19:10.820 --> 19:13.700
No, it didn't. It's a chicken egg. Just, like, play along with me here, okay?

19:13.700 --> 19:15.940
You didn't tell me to picture a bowl.

19:15.940 --> 19:18.100
Let me warn you now. This isn't that funny.

19:18.100 --> 19:20.740
So if we prolong getting to the end of it,

19:20.740 --> 19:23.220
like, there's not- it's not gonna be worth the payoff.

19:23.220 --> 19:25.620
So you just have to let me just talk you through this, okay?

19:25.620 --> 19:27.060
So you crack an egg into a bowl, okay?

19:27.060 --> 19:28.020
Got it.

19:28.020 --> 19:30.260
And you take the shell and you throw it in the trash, right?

19:30.260 --> 19:31.860
Or you compost it. It's up to you.

19:31.860 --> 19:34.260
I don't know your setup. Did you do that?

19:34.980 --> 19:35.620
Yes.

19:35.620 --> 19:37.140
Yeah, let me imagine a trash can.

19:37.140 --> 19:37.380
Okay.

19:38.260 --> 19:40.260
Okay, so what's in the bowl?

19:41.060 --> 19:41.380
Egg.

19:41.940 --> 19:42.660
Egg.

19:42.660 --> 19:43.460
An egg, right?

19:44.100 --> 19:44.420
Yes.

19:45.460 --> 19:49.540
Okay, so that's weird.

19:49.540 --> 19:51.300
All right, you guys want a yahoo?

19:52.180 --> 19:53.620
Because if you think about it,

19:54.260 --> 19:56.340
it was an egg when it had the shell on it.

19:56.340 --> 19:58.900
You crack it into a bowl, and in the bowl you have an egg.

19:58.900 --> 19:59.460
Yeah.

19:59.460 --> 20:01.620
But it doesn't have a shell. So which is it?

20:01.620 --> 20:02.180
Yeah, so-

20:02.180 --> 20:04.260
And I think ghosts are kind of like that.

20:04.260 --> 20:07.540
Okay, but hold on, Justin. You have just proven my point,

20:07.540 --> 20:10.100
which is the egg is inside the shell the whole time.

20:10.100 --> 20:14.820
And so what you're saying is these fleshy sacks in which we live are the shell,

20:14.820 --> 20:16.340
and the ghost is the human.

20:17.460 --> 20:18.740
I'm saying it's a prison.

20:18.740 --> 20:21.140
I'm saying our bodies are prisons for ghosts.

20:21.140 --> 20:25.940
Okay, because you started this saying that ghosts were not just in there piloting us around,

20:25.940 --> 20:28.100
but rather now you're saying they're trapped.

20:28.100 --> 20:30.900
You shut down any meet Dave jokes that we could have made,

20:30.900 --> 20:33.540
which was fucking selfish of you.

20:33.540 --> 20:36.420
Yeah, but then I listened to my egg thing, and I was like,

20:36.420 --> 20:37.620
fuck, that's a good point.

20:39.140 --> 20:40.500
Hey, speaking of eggs,

20:41.860 --> 20:46.260
I think that maybe we should take a second and explore some

20:46.260 --> 20:49.860
farm wisdom. Farm wisdom.

20:50.580 --> 20:53.620
If you crack an egg into a bowl, it's still an egg.

20:53.620 --> 20:54.580
Farm wisdom.

20:55.380 --> 20:56.740
Welcome to Farm Wisdom.

20:57.380 --> 20:57.940
Nice.

20:57.940 --> 21:01.940
It's a segment on the show that we do when people send in farm wisdom.

21:02.660 --> 21:05.220
And this one was sent in by Becca Fenn. Thank you, Becca.

21:06.020 --> 21:14.980
And I guess before we get started, a quick straw poll from you, my brothers in the audience.

21:14.980 --> 21:16.580
It's appropriate for Farm Wisdom.

21:16.580 --> 21:17.620
Yeah, all good.

21:18.580 --> 21:21.220
So put straw in Comic Sans so you know it's a joke.

21:21.220 --> 21:24.420
And the question I have for you, Justin and Travis,

21:25.540 --> 21:30.580
just straw poll hands up, yes or no vote, is if horses have fingers?

21:31.300 --> 21:33.220
No, they have hooves?

21:33.220 --> 21:34.660
Yeah, I'm going to say no.

21:34.660 --> 21:38.260
Well, Becca says, in the spirit of Collaborating and thinking about these beautiful horse

21:38.260 --> 21:41.220
friends pulling carts, I thought you'd like to know a little bit about their legs.

21:41.220 --> 21:44.100
I come from rural Vermont, so I'm familiar with a lot of farm wisdom.

21:44.100 --> 21:46.260
But finding this out today fucked me up.

21:46.260 --> 21:48.900
Yeah, by the way, heads up, this is going to fuck you right up.

21:49.540 --> 21:52.900
Horses' legs are giant fingers.

21:53.860 --> 21:57.220
The reason they have such poor health outcomes after breaking or otherwise injuring their

21:57.220 --> 22:00.020
legs is because their legs are actually hyper-specialized fingers.

22:00.020 --> 22:02.580
Similar to human fingers, there's very little muscle supporting the bones,

22:02.580 --> 22:04.420
just a lot of cartilage and tendons and whatnot.

22:05.460 --> 22:09.620
This is from a Quora thing about if horses have fingers.

22:09.620 --> 22:12.100
And the answer is, horrifyingly, yes.

22:12.100 --> 22:15.940
The carpus is called the knee, but it is anatomically the wrist.

22:15.940 --> 22:19.540
From the carpus down, the horse has just three finger bones.

22:19.540 --> 22:22.260
The large one in the middle is called the cannon bone, and it goes all the way to the

22:22.980 --> 22:26.180
fetlock joint, which looks like the horse's ankle.

22:26.180 --> 22:30.020
The two vestigial finger bones descending from the carpus and providing lateral support

22:30.020 --> 22:31.780
to the cannon are called splint bones.

22:31.780 --> 22:34.820
The part you might think of as the horse's foot is called the hoof.

22:34.820 --> 22:35.940
I didn't really need that part.

22:36.580 --> 22:40.420
The hoof wall is a particularly tough fingernail material with sensitive tissue beneath it,

22:40.420 --> 22:44.260
just as your fingernail has, and the smallest part of the phalanx bones within it,

22:44.260 --> 22:46.660
anatomically comparable to the tip of your finger.

22:47.460 --> 22:52.340
The oldest equines, this is additional information if your being's not completely freaked out,

22:52.340 --> 22:54.580
the oldest equines have five toes.

22:54.580 --> 22:57.940
As the species evolved, horses gradually dropped their digit number down to four,

22:57.940 --> 22:59.540
three, and then just one.

22:59.540 --> 23:03.380
Like their ancient ancestors, modern horses have the genes for five toes.

23:04.820 --> 23:05.940
Get the fuck out.

23:07.380 --> 23:08.500
So these are fingers.

23:08.500 --> 23:16.660
When you look at a horse, I want you to imagine head, neck, torso, and then four galloping,

23:17.300 --> 23:24.260
cantering, powerful, long, fuzzy fingers with ending in fingernails that are the hooves,

23:24.260 --> 23:27.540
which by the way, horseshoes sound real, real bad now.

23:28.340 --> 23:31.780
They sounded not great before, the whole process looked kind of yucky.

23:31.780 --> 23:33.940
I understand it does provide protection.

23:33.940 --> 23:36.340
Yeah, I mean, when you think about it, you probably don't want to be walking around

23:36.340 --> 23:42.420
directly on your fingernails, but yes, these are fingers now that are on these horses,

23:42.420 --> 23:46.260
so it's fine, now you can do it with your hand, or you make your hand down in a little

23:46.260 --> 23:50.180
walking monster, and that's kind of what a horse is if you think about a big finger

23:50.180 --> 23:51.780
having a walk monster, so.

23:51.780 --> 23:53.780
Wait, so their head is a finger too?

23:54.500 --> 23:56.900
No, you goofball, the head's a head.

23:57.620 --> 23:59.300
The rest of it's though fingers all the way down.

23:59.300 --> 24:02.020
But if you had asked me Griffin, I can't assume that anymore, because you would have

24:02.020 --> 24:04.980
asked me ten minutes ago and I told you their legs were legs.

24:04.980 --> 24:10.020
And I was like, their fingers are legs, and their tail is a finger, and their head is

24:10.020 --> 24:10.900
a finger.

24:10.900 --> 24:16.900
The number one test scientists use for something's a finger is if you cut it off, does the thing

24:16.900 --> 24:17.620
die?

24:17.620 --> 24:20.820
And if you cut a horse's head off, it will die, so it can't be a finger.

24:20.820 --> 24:21.700
It can't possibly be a finger.

24:21.700 --> 24:26.260
And also, if you point at a horse and say, hey, do they point their hand at you or their

24:26.260 --> 24:27.940
head at you, you know what I mean?

24:27.940 --> 24:28.420
Yeah.

24:28.420 --> 24:31.860
So if you go to a horse and you're like, give me five, and the horse is like, no!

24:32.660 --> 24:33.620
Yeah, that's why.

24:33.620 --> 24:37.140
No, please, anything, but I can never leave a bro hanging, but please.

24:37.140 --> 24:44.980
If my math is correct though, each thing, each appendage, we'll call it that, has four

24:44.980 --> 24:46.420
finger bones in it.

24:46.420 --> 24:49.380
So if you asked a horse for five, it would get pretty confused.

24:49.380 --> 24:55.140
It could give you eight or four, otherwise it's going to give you a full five, or a full

24:55.140 --> 24:58.820
four, and that's going to destroy your hand, by the way, and then try to figure out a way

24:58.820 --> 25:00.660
to just get one finger bone up on you.

25:00.660 --> 25:04.900
Ah, this is a challenging episode, just mentally.

25:04.900 --> 25:06.580
One, are we all haunted?

25:06.580 --> 25:09.620
Two, horses are running around on their fingers.

25:10.260 --> 25:10.980
Loving it, though.

25:11.780 --> 25:12.740
But they're not.

25:13.620 --> 25:16.260
This is linguistic nonsense.

25:16.260 --> 25:17.140
They're legs.

25:18.020 --> 25:20.660
You can't just say something's fingers.

25:20.660 --> 25:21.860
We all know what that is.

25:22.660 --> 25:24.660
Didn't know you were a horse boneologist.

25:25.300 --> 25:27.060
No, I'm just saying you can't.

25:27.060 --> 25:29.060
Oh, it's interesting, Justin, I didn't know.

25:29.060 --> 25:30.820
You're so talented in so many different ways.

25:30.820 --> 25:33.300
I didn't know you also had a horse boneology degree.

25:33.860 --> 25:34.980
Where did you study?

25:34.980 --> 25:36.740
Where did you study, Justin, Johns Hopkins?

25:37.300 --> 25:38.660
The School of Hard Knocks.

25:38.660 --> 25:40.580
I've learned the hard way.

25:41.780 --> 25:44.020
Them's his legs, they're not fingers.

25:44.660 --> 25:45.540
You can't trick me.

25:47.140 --> 25:50.420
How come Johns Hopkins is called Johns Hopkins?

25:50.420 --> 26:02.580
Is it referring, does John possess a Hopkins?

26:06.580 --> 26:07.860
Christ almighty.

26:09.620 --> 26:10.980
Anyway, should we go to the money zone?

26:11.780 --> 26:14.260
His parents named him Johns.

26:14.260 --> 26:14.740
All right.

26:15.940 --> 26:16.580
Multiple.

26:16.580 --> 26:19.460
Multiple, so here comes the money zone.

26:32.100 --> 26:38.740
Hey folks, if you want to freshen up your look for the new year,

26:38.740 --> 26:40.660
but you have no idea where to start,

26:42.180 --> 26:44.420
I cannot recommend Stitch Fix enough.

26:44.420 --> 26:46.420
It's a new way to shop for clothes.

26:46.420 --> 26:47.620
They do all the work for you.

26:47.620 --> 26:49.300
You go online, you answer some questions

26:49.300 --> 26:51.540
about your favorite styles and budget.

26:52.340 --> 26:54.740
And it doesn't say fabric allergies on here,

26:54.740 --> 26:56.660
but I'm assuming that's part of it.

26:57.300 --> 27:00.420
And your personal stylist will pick five pieces

27:00.420 --> 27:01.220
based on your preference.

27:01.220 --> 27:03.220
They send you a box and you look at the stuff,

27:03.220 --> 27:06.980
you try the stuff on and you only keep the stuff that you,

27:07.700 --> 27:08.980
or you only pay for the stuff you keep.

27:08.980 --> 27:12.100
The rest of the stuff you put in a bag that comes with the box

27:12.100 --> 27:14.260
and the bag is all pre-postage paid and everything.

27:14.260 --> 27:15.460
And then you ship it right back to them,

27:15.460 --> 27:16.180
the stuff you don't like.

27:16.180 --> 27:19.300
And they take your feedback on the box

27:19.300 --> 27:20.980
and then they do better next time,

27:20.980 --> 27:23.060
which I think is something we should all strive to do

27:23.060 --> 27:25.620
and follow in Stitch Fix's example.

27:25.620 --> 27:27.220
It's not a subscription thing.

27:27.220 --> 27:29.300
You just pay for the clothes that you like.

27:30.100 --> 27:32.740
And I have been using the service for a long time.

27:32.740 --> 27:35.620
Sid's been using it for maternity clothes

27:35.620 --> 27:38.340
and they've sent a lot of stuff to her that she's really dug.

27:38.340 --> 27:42.740
It's hard to find really great maternity stuff,

27:42.740 --> 27:44.340
but they have a really good hit rate.

27:44.340 --> 27:46.100
I think the last box she kept everything.

27:46.100 --> 27:48.580
Yeah, my last two boxes I've kept everything.

27:48.580 --> 27:50.580
I'm wearing a Stitch Fix shirt right now.

27:50.580 --> 27:53.220
They are, I don't know how they like,

27:53.700 --> 27:57.380
I mean, you fill out a survey about what your style is

27:57.380 --> 27:59.380
and your fit and everything,

27:59.380 --> 28:04.260
but it's kind of like magic how well they've got me kind of pegged.

28:04.260 --> 28:07.060
And it's interesting too, the stuff that you,

28:07.060 --> 28:10.100
there's been some stuff where I'm like, I'm not so sure.

28:10.100 --> 28:12.260
And I tried on like, yeah, I guess this is me,

28:12.260 --> 28:14.500
or this is the me I'm going to strive to be.

28:14.500 --> 28:16.660
This is an aspirational shirt.

28:16.660 --> 28:20.340
Sure, you can get started now at stitchfix.com slash my brother

28:20.340 --> 28:23.060

28:25.300 --> 28:28.340
One more time, stitchfix.com slash my brother.

28:28.340 --> 28:29.540
I want to tell you about Clip.

28:30.180 --> 28:33.940
Let's be honest, none of us do enough for our teeth.

28:33.940 --> 28:35.540
Our teeth have always been there for us.

28:35.540 --> 28:39.780
Us chomping stuff, biting stuff, protecting our tongue.

28:40.580 --> 28:42.260
And yeah, what do we do for them?

28:42.260 --> 28:43.300
Well, it's time.

28:43.300 --> 28:45.620
It's time for you to work together with your teeth.

28:46.260 --> 28:48.740
20 collaborate team, work with your teeth.

28:49.940 --> 28:52.500
You should brush your teeth at least two minutes twice a day,

28:52.500 --> 28:53.380
but do you?

28:53.380 --> 28:54.900
Oh my God, no.

28:55.460 --> 28:56.500
Wowsers, no.

28:57.380 --> 28:58.020
Yeah.

28:58.020 --> 28:59.140
That's four minutes.

28:59.140 --> 29:00.980
What am I supposed to, come on.

29:00.980 --> 29:02.260
I'm a busy man.

29:02.260 --> 29:04.420
So you're going to want to find out about Clip.

29:04.420 --> 29:06.340
So Clip is the new electric toothbrush.

29:06.340 --> 29:10.740
It packs just the right amount of vibrations and everything

29:10.740 --> 29:14.420
into a very slim, cool looking, stylish design

29:14.420 --> 29:16.820
at a fraction of the cost of bulkier brushes.

29:16.820 --> 29:18.020
I am a big fan.

29:18.020 --> 29:21.540
It has now become the brush I both use every day

29:21.540 --> 29:25.860
and travel with because it is compact enough

29:25.860 --> 29:28.020
to bring your electric toothbrush with you

29:28.020 --> 29:29.940
without feeling like it's taking up all kinds of room.

29:29.940 --> 29:32.260
It's a sexy little electric toothbrush.

29:32.260 --> 29:33.060
Yeah, it's great.

29:33.060 --> 29:35.060
And it's got a mount that goes right on the mirror.

29:35.060 --> 29:37.380
So it keeps it up off of everything

29:37.380 --> 29:39.860
and leaves you some counter space there.

29:40.660 --> 29:43.460
And you can get new brush heads delivered every three months

29:43.460 --> 29:44.180
for just $5.

29:44.740 --> 29:46.740
And then it's including free shipping.

29:46.740 --> 29:49.220
So Clip starts at just $25.

29:49.220 --> 29:52.820
And right now, when you go to getclip.com slash my brother,

29:52.820 --> 29:55.300
you get your first refill pack free

29:55.300 --> 29:57.220
with a Clip electric toothbrush.

29:57.220 --> 30:03.620

30:03.620 --> 30:04.740
slash my brother.

30:04.740 --> 30:05.380
Go check it out.

30:06.740 --> 30:07.940
I have a jumbotron here.

30:07.940 --> 30:12.180
And that is that I want you all to search for matinee manatees

30:12.180 --> 30:15.780
on iTunes, Stitcher, or at matineemanatees.com.

30:16.660 --> 30:19.620
If you listen to podcasts to help you fall asleep,

30:19.620 --> 30:22.180
but you keep getting startled or you wind up staying awake

30:22.180 --> 30:24.100
because you don't want to miss anything interesting,

30:24.100 --> 30:26.260
you may want to try matinee manatees.

30:26.260 --> 30:28.580
It's a podcast that is specifically designed

30:28.580 --> 30:29.620
to fall asleep to.

30:30.340 --> 30:31.860
It's hosted underwater.

30:31.860 --> 30:33.940
And I don't know if that's true or not, but if it is,

30:33.940 --> 30:38.740
fuck yeah, by a rotating cast of half ton aquatic mammals.

30:38.740 --> 30:41.220
They mix the peaceful sounds of marine ambience

30:41.220 --> 30:44.580
with low pitch discussions of old movies you've already seen.

30:44.580 --> 30:47.300
And the episodes are real long to help you fall asleep.

30:47.860 --> 30:50.580
It's free on iTunes, Stitcher, or once again,

30:50.580 --> 30:53.300
at matineemanatees.com.

30:53.300 --> 30:55.940
I would like to take this opportunity.

30:57.620 --> 30:59.940
It's a message from your friendly neighborhood mods

30:59.940 --> 31:01.860
and it's for Awful Squad Jr.

31:01.860 --> 31:02.900
Hell yeah.

31:03.540 --> 31:05.620
And all the honorary wigglers out there.

31:05.620 --> 31:06.580
Ready up, wigglers.

31:06.580 --> 31:07.780
It's time to spread some laughs.

31:07.780 --> 31:09.700
Can you believe we have a community of people

31:09.700 --> 31:13.380
playing video games who all rank goofs higher than skills?

31:13.380 --> 31:16.420
Here's to many more good, good bike stunts,

31:16.420 --> 31:19.060
impromptu turn coding, hilarious ragdolls,

31:19.060 --> 31:20.820
and making peace using only wiggles.

31:20.820 --> 31:23.860
We love and support you and are sending you all the virtual

31:23.860 --> 31:24.340
hugs.

31:24.900 --> 31:27.620
That's from Awful Squad Jr., which is the,

31:28.500 --> 31:32.500
I would say, partner in a web series called Awful Squad

31:32.500 --> 31:33.700
that we do over at Polygon.

31:34.260 --> 31:35.220
You should go check that out.

31:35.220 --> 31:36.180
It's so much fun.

31:36.180 --> 31:38.420
They're half, they're literally half the reason

31:38.420 --> 31:40.020
that it's such a fun thing to do.

31:40.020 --> 31:43.860
They are the 100 and the one versus 100 of Awful Squad.

31:43.860 --> 31:44.820
I think they're more than half.

31:44.820 --> 31:47.540
I think they're the majority share.

31:47.540 --> 31:49.700
It's a really, really fun community and a really cool

31:49.700 --> 31:51.860
thing that we do live every Tuesday.

31:52.420 --> 31:53.620
I have one more Jumbotron here.

31:53.620 --> 31:56.420
This one's for Sam and Nick, and it's from Anita, who says,

31:56.420 --> 31:57.620
congrats on your engagement.

31:57.620 --> 31:59.380
Since I introduced you to the McElroys

31:59.940 --> 32:02.420
and deserve partial credit for the events that introduced you

32:02.420 --> 32:04.260
to each other, I thought this is the perfect way

32:04.260 --> 32:05.380
to send my love.

32:05.380 --> 32:06.660
I'm thrilled you found each other,

32:06.660 --> 32:09.380
and I truly can't wait to rage at your wedding.

32:09.380 --> 32:12.260
Here's to a long and joyous future together.

32:12.260 --> 32:16.980
I'm hoping they're using rage in like the colloquial fun,

32:16.980 --> 32:22.020
like let's day rage and not like I'm going to be infected

32:22.020 --> 32:22.900
with the rage virus.

32:22.900 --> 32:24.660
And I am going to attack your grandma.

32:24.660 --> 32:26.260
I'm going to come right at her, and you will not

32:26.260 --> 32:27.060
be able to stop me.

32:27.060 --> 32:27.940
And then it'll spread.

32:28.740 --> 32:29.460
It always spreads.

32:29.460 --> 32:31.780
And I'm sorry, but I am looking forward to it.

32:31.780 --> 32:32.900
I am looking forward to it.

32:32.900 --> 32:33.780
It's going to be fun.

32:33.780 --> 32:34.740
I'm thrilled about it.

32:35.300 --> 32:36.340
Your grandma's not going to be.

32:37.940 --> 32:38.740
Podcasts.

32:38.740 --> 32:39.620
Podcasts.

32:39.620 --> 32:40.420
Podcasts.

32:41.540 --> 32:44.500
They're audio programs that tell smart stories

32:44.500 --> 32:47.380
in innovative ways using editing techniques like this.

32:47.380 --> 32:47.940
Like this.

32:47.940 --> 32:48.500
Like this.

32:48.500 --> 32:49.060
Like this.

32:50.260 --> 32:54.180
But let's face it, all that smart stuff can be exhausting.

32:54.180 --> 32:56.740
That's where Stop Podcasting Yourself comes in.

32:56.740 --> 32:58.020
It's so stupid.

32:58.020 --> 33:01.300
It's just two stupid dinguses being dumb idiot jerks

33:01.300 --> 33:02.180
for 90 minutes.

33:02.980 --> 33:04.660
Stop Podcasting Yourself.

33:04.660 --> 33:07.460
The stupid show that smart people love.

33:07.460 --> 33:10.820
Find it on iTunes or maximumfun.org.

33:10.820 --> 33:11.700
How about a Yahoo?

33:12.420 --> 33:13.460
I'd love that, Griffin.

33:13.460 --> 33:14.260
Thank you so much.

33:14.260 --> 33:15.700
Yeah, this is one from Level 9000.

33:15.700 --> 33:17.540
Yadru drew a Drew Davenport.

33:17.540 --> 33:18.260
Thank you, Drew.

33:18.260 --> 33:20.100
Yadru answers user D who asks.

33:21.220 --> 33:24.500
And this is not the setup for a joke, but it could be.

33:25.380 --> 33:27.380
Isn't everything we do on this podcast that?

33:27.380 --> 33:32.660
Anyway, why do people from New Jersey ski in their jeans?

33:33.860 --> 33:34.420
I don't know.

33:34.420 --> 33:35.460
Why do they?

33:35.460 --> 33:36.500
I fucking just said.

33:37.380 --> 33:39.860
Why do people from New Jersey ski in their jeans?

33:40.900 --> 33:41.460
I don't know.

33:41.460 --> 33:42.500
Why do they?

33:42.500 --> 33:44.180
This is tough.

33:44.180 --> 33:44.820
This is tough.

33:44.820 --> 33:47.140
I mean, it's tough because Travis is antagonizing me.

33:47.700 --> 33:52.580
But it's also you got to put on a sort of nylon snow

33:52.580 --> 33:54.020
resistant ski pants.

33:54.020 --> 33:56.820
Because if not the snow, oh, OK.

33:56.820 --> 33:58.260
Well, Travis have at it.

33:59.060 --> 34:01.300
What if you got some really cool looking jeans?

34:01.940 --> 34:03.380
No, I know you want to show the jeans off.

34:03.380 --> 34:04.340
But there's a time and a place.

34:04.340 --> 34:06.580
I don't think when somebody goes zoom and past you

34:06.580 --> 34:10.020
on those beautiful slippery rails that we do call skis.

34:10.020 --> 34:13.860
At, you know, however fast skis go, like 60 miles an hour.

34:13.860 --> 34:16.340
I don't think they're going to stop and smell the jeans.

34:16.340 --> 34:16.980
You know what I mean?

34:16.980 --> 34:21.860
The only reason you couldn't wear jeans is because you're

34:21.860 --> 34:24.420
going to fall into the snow and get them wet.

34:24.420 --> 34:24.820
Correct?

34:24.820 --> 34:25.620
Correct.

34:25.620 --> 34:26.260
I mean, yes.

34:26.900 --> 34:28.020
That's if you fall down.

34:28.900 --> 34:29.780
Yes, thank you.

34:29.780 --> 34:30.740
This is what I'm saying.

34:31.620 --> 34:35.220
If I'm going to carve the slopes and I'm not going to fall,

34:36.020 --> 34:37.460
I can wear whatever the fuck I want.

34:37.460 --> 34:41.700
So New Jerseyans, you're saying, are just exemplary skiers.

34:41.700 --> 34:42.260
They do not.

34:42.260 --> 34:44.900
They're just great skiers who can wear jeans because they're

34:44.900 --> 34:47.540
not going to fall and get their jeans all shitty with snow.

34:48.100 --> 34:49.540
They're going to carve the slopes.

34:49.540 --> 34:50.740
They're going to land.

34:50.740 --> 34:54.020
They're going to zoom right into the lodge or whatever

34:54.660 --> 34:57.620
and have some French onion soup and just kick it.

34:58.740 --> 35:02.500
It's like if you were like a duelist who only wore white

35:02.500 --> 35:04.660
because you know you won't show blood.

35:04.660 --> 35:05.700
You know, that kind of thing.

35:05.700 --> 35:06.660
Yeah, thank you.

35:06.660 --> 35:07.460
Yes.

35:07.460 --> 35:10.340
Yes, this is the New Jersey shot call.

35:10.340 --> 35:10.740
Yeah.

35:10.740 --> 35:13.140
Of like, I shall not be falling down.

35:13.140 --> 35:17.300
I will meet you at the bottom at, I don't know, either the lodge

35:17.300 --> 35:19.060
or maybe like bubblegum shrimp.

35:19.060 --> 35:20.580
We haven't made plans.

35:20.580 --> 35:24.500
Damn, that's a cool ski mountain if it's got a bubblegum shrimp on it.

35:25.540 --> 35:29.780
Well, you know, you get hungry and you want to get some, I don't know.

35:29.780 --> 35:32.660
I've never been to a bubblegum shrimp, but I assume there's shrimp there.

35:32.660 --> 35:35.700
Yeah, there's a lot of it, Trav.

35:35.700 --> 35:36.740
I can confirm.

35:36.740 --> 35:41.380
I probably will come as a great surprise to literally no one

35:41.380 --> 35:45.220
that I have been to a bubblegum shrimp company before.

35:45.220 --> 35:46.260
Yeah, Trav, they got shrimp.

35:46.260 --> 35:47.460
They got all kinds of shrimp.

35:48.260 --> 36:02.020
Steamed shrimp, hot shrimp, good shrimp, little shrimp, aggressive shrimp,

36:02.020 --> 36:03.060
boneless shrimp.

36:05.780 --> 36:08.500
Okay, listen, straight up, if you own a restaurant,

36:08.500 --> 36:10.740
please start advertising boneless shrimp.

36:10.740 --> 36:11.140
Please, please.

36:11.140 --> 36:12.420
It's important that you do this.

36:12.420 --> 36:13.300
That's so funny.

36:13.300 --> 36:22.020
I went skiing one time and I didn't take, they had classes,

36:22.020 --> 36:26.180
which I think in retrospect, I wish I had forced the issue.

36:26.180 --> 36:29.860
I asked about them and no one in my party wanted to do the classes

36:29.860 --> 36:30.660
because they all loved it out there.

36:30.660 --> 36:31.860
Was yours also a church thing?

36:31.860 --> 36:34.100
Because I've only been once and it was a church thing.

36:34.100 --> 36:39.540
No, it was a bunch of junior doctors and I was getting out there

36:40.340 --> 36:44.260
and I basically was at the top of the hill without knowledge

36:44.260 --> 36:45.140
of how to ski.

36:45.940 --> 36:50.100
I knew pizza and french fries was one where if you make your skis

36:50.100 --> 36:54.820
like french fries, you go and if you make them like in a triangle

36:54.820 --> 36:58.100
that could hold pizza, did they stop?

36:58.100 --> 37:01.460
I'm sorry, they told me that and then what I did after that

37:01.460 --> 37:08.580
was I just slid down the hill on my belly one time.

37:08.580 --> 37:10.020
Like a graceful penguin?

37:11.860 --> 37:16.980
No, sort of like a dead penguin and I just slid down the hill

37:16.980 --> 37:23.700
like an idiot and then I pounded my way back up in my stupid boots

37:24.340 --> 37:29.940
back up to the place we were staying and the relief I felt

37:29.940 --> 37:36.180
knowing that the skiing was a part of my life was behind me

37:36.180 --> 37:38.900
and that there would never be skiing in the future

37:39.700 --> 37:43.940
is a relief that I have not experienced before or since.

37:43.940 --> 37:48.740
And I've kind of thought like should I go skiing again

37:50.020 --> 37:55.220
just so I can experience the exhilaration and luxury

37:55.220 --> 37:59.060
of the feeling of not skiing immediately after skiing.

37:59.060 --> 38:04.900
Um, I went once with Church and to continue Justin's sort of wonderful analogy earlier

38:04.900 --> 38:08.020
I had myself a veritable pizza party.

38:08.580 --> 38:09.940
It was the only way I did it.

38:09.940 --> 38:11.140
I got yelled at.

38:11.140 --> 38:14.660
I tried a medium, what is it, blue circle slope

38:15.940 --> 38:19.540
and I got yelled at by somebody who's zooming by a lot faster

38:19.540 --> 38:21.140
like you need to learn how to do this.

38:22.500 --> 38:23.460
Which I would have.

38:23.460 --> 38:24.580
Why is that yelling though?

38:26.100 --> 38:28.820
I think the problem is if they called

38:28.820 --> 38:30.100
I was like in high school

38:30.900 --> 38:34.740
and I wasn't going to get on something called a bunny slope

38:34.740 --> 38:36.980
to learn how to do the thing.

38:36.980 --> 38:41.780
I wish it was called something a little bit less insulting for you know teens.

38:42.340 --> 38:47.700
Something like you know the cool the cool slope or the um the

38:47.700 --> 38:50.420
oh shit if they had called it the ice trial

38:50.420 --> 38:53.300
and it's like oh if you want to ride if you want to take one of the trails

38:53.300 --> 38:55.060
you have to pass the ice trial

38:55.060 --> 38:56.820
and then maybe you got a badge at the end of it

38:56.820 --> 39:00.020
um that would definitely be my jam.

39:00.580 --> 39:03.940
Um but yeah there's a lot of problems with skiing.

39:03.940 --> 39:07.780
I have never been uh skiing and and the reason is

39:08.740 --> 39:12.100
um I like to be very introspective

39:12.100 --> 39:14.340
think about myself what do I know about myself

39:14.340 --> 39:16.180
what are my core truths

39:16.180 --> 39:20.980
and one of those core truths is that I have zero interest in going skiing.

39:21.540 --> 39:26.100
I just there's nothing I don't like being outside my house when it's cold

39:26.100 --> 39:33.540
let alone looking down an incline uh at what must be almost certain death

39:34.420 --> 39:38.100
and it's cold and I have things tied to my feet.

39:38.100 --> 39:41.620
If not death certain like certain wet jeans

39:41.620 --> 39:44.340
because now I think back I was wearing my jeans my jeans.

39:44.900 --> 39:47.860
Yes and they weren't those were jinkos at the time so.

39:47.860 --> 39:49.460
They were probably jinkos Travis yes

39:49.460 --> 39:54.020
and the problem with jinkos is that they look fucking excellent obviously.

39:54.020 --> 39:54.980
Sure sure sure.

39:54.980 --> 40:01.620
But those big leg holes are essentially welcoming snow mouths

40:01.620 --> 40:07.300
that just gobble the stuff up and deposit it directly on my calves thighs and business

40:08.420 --> 40:12.180
and I I'm just saying at the end of the day I took off the jinkos

40:12.180 --> 40:17.060
there were two perfectly sized sort of leg molds inside of it made out of snow

40:17.060 --> 40:20.500
uh you could have made the bottom half of a very convincing griffin snowman

40:20.500 --> 40:22.580
and not just convincing anatomically correct.

40:22.580 --> 40:25.380
In fact my wiener got really weird.

40:26.020 --> 40:33.060
Oh got it okay yeah thanks because I was I was not sure what you were uh sort of talking about.

40:33.060 --> 40:34.820
Yeah the snow made it really weird.

40:34.820 --> 40:36.100
How about another question?

40:36.100 --> 40:40.740
Give you a weird dick yeah that's great um here is one.

40:40.740 --> 40:43.620
Every time my family gets together they mention this woman named Ann.

40:43.620 --> 40:47.460
They never say anything that Ann has said or done just how much they hate her.

40:47.460 --> 40:49.860
I used to theorize to my cousins about who Ann could be

40:49.860 --> 40:52.580
but once they turned 16 they started talking about Ann too.

40:54.820 --> 40:58.340
Why do all the members of my massive extended family who are 16 and over

40:58.900 --> 41:00.340
know and hate this woman?

41:00.340 --> 41:01.300
What did Ann do?

41:01.860 --> 41:05.380
Should I ask who she is or wait a year so that I turn 16?

41:05.940 --> 41:09.540
Please help from mystified about myth members in Massachusetts.

41:09.540 --> 41:16.340
What what could your what could you possibly learn at what what's why would there be an age gate on

41:16.340 --> 41:19.940
that the only thing I can think is that your family is all vampires

41:20.900 --> 41:26.420
and that when you turn 16 you learn the truth of the matter and that Ann is it and is it well

41:26.420 --> 41:32.980
possibly there's a libel situation as Ann Rice talks a bunch of shit or Ann is just a you know

41:32.980 --> 41:34.260
famous vampire hunter.

41:35.300 --> 41:39.780
Or vice versa it might be that Ann is a famous vampire your family is a family of hunters.

41:40.580 --> 41:44.820
I don't want to speculate because it could go either way and you're the next generation

41:44.820 --> 41:47.380
maybe you will finally be the one who takes down Ann.

41:48.420 --> 41:52.180
Have you noticed your family gets smaller and smaller every year?

41:52.180 --> 41:56.180
I mean here's the thing it's got to be that the family's vampire hunters and Ann's a vampire

41:56.180 --> 42:00.660
because we know that this person's not a vampire because they typed this thing into a computer

42:00.660 --> 42:06.260
and emailed it and I'm I get real fucked up if I think about a vampire who can also use like

42:06.260 --> 42:06.900
search the web.

42:07.540 --> 42:08.500
Yeah I can't deal with that.

42:08.500 --> 42:13.060
I don't really like that I don't think that happens in Twilight's where you know Edward's

42:13.060 --> 42:18.820
like hold on let me get up if he did it would be on like Alta Vista or some like old bullshit

42:18.820 --> 42:25.460
but yeah and you never see you know Castlevania Dracula's like hold up gotta look up a you know

42:25.460 --> 42:27.460
a new recipe for poison.

42:29.460 --> 42:35.460
Yesterday my wife was watching the last 20 minutes of the last Twilight movie.

42:35.460 --> 42:36.100
How was it?

42:36.100 --> 42:43.620
And I was emptying the dishwasher and she kept telling me context on the things that

42:43.620 --> 42:48.340
were happening and I couldn't leave because I was emptying the dishwasher so I was a

42:48.340 --> 42:56.740
captive audience for just seeing the last end of this movie with like a bunch of lore

42:56.740 --> 43:01.860
and it didn't seem real to me that they had gotten to that point in four movies.

43:01.860 --> 43:07.060
It seemed like maybe the 30th movie would contain all the incredible truths.

43:07.060 --> 43:11.620
Did you know the werewolf in that movies got decided to marry a little girl?

43:12.500 --> 43:15.780
That's a thing he imprinted on her and said he was going to marry her and she's like

43:15.780 --> 43:16.660
six?

43:16.660 --> 43:18.020
That's no good.

43:18.020 --> 43:18.980
That's in it.

43:18.980 --> 43:19.860
That's in it.

43:19.860 --> 43:25.140
What other reason could Ann be a bad person that you don't know about until you turn 16?

43:25.140 --> 43:28.660
Why is your birthright knowing the truth about Ann?

43:28.660 --> 43:29.620
I've got it.

43:29.620 --> 43:36.580
Ann is just the name that they hear until they turn 16 when the true name is revealed,

43:36.580 --> 43:37.300
Cthulhu.

43:38.660 --> 43:39.460
All right.

43:39.460 --> 43:40.980
So they hate the deep one.

43:40.980 --> 43:44.180
I assume this is an unspeakable one kind of scenario, yes.

43:44.820 --> 43:46.500
Maybe Ann is code for you.

43:48.900 --> 43:54.660
They can't trust you with the secret until you're 16 and then boy that is going to be

43:54.660 --> 43:57.380
a rough sweet 16 party though.

43:57.380 --> 43:58.100
Happy birthday.

43:58.100 --> 43:59.940
Ann.

43:59.940 --> 44:00.500
No that's not it.

44:00.500 --> 44:01.460
That's probably not that one.

44:01.460 --> 44:02.260
That's not it.

44:02.260 --> 44:08.740
I do enjoy, I'm still hung up on the idea of vampire hunters whose idea of hunting the

44:08.740 --> 44:13.220
one vampire they know about is just to sit around and talk shit about them.

44:13.220 --> 44:16.660
Because that is, if you think about it, vampire hunters do have downtime.

44:16.660 --> 44:22.820
That is almost certainly like, man fucking Dracula, that guy, I can't even with that

44:22.820 --> 44:23.620
idiot anymore.

44:23.620 --> 44:24.580
I hate his guts.

44:24.580 --> 44:29.220
Real talk, if I wake up in the middle of the night from a horrible vision where I find

44:29.220 --> 44:34.180
out that I'm the chosen one, once in a generation I'm supposed to go out and slay vampires.

44:34.820 --> 44:39.620
I got like a lot of stuff going on right now and also don't want to be killed by a vampire

44:39.620 --> 44:41.380
because I would not be good at this.

44:41.380 --> 44:43.460
This would also probably be my M.O.

44:43.460 --> 44:48.500
I would not go out staking hand holy water in my, you know, a camelback or something

44:48.500 --> 44:54.820
like that, ready to slay, because again, I don't want to be dead from a vampire bites.

44:55.380 --> 44:59.140
So what I'd probably do is just like, hey, I don't know if you guys know about vampires,

44:59.140 --> 45:02.340
but they are real buttholes.

45:02.340 --> 45:06.580
This would sort of, I would get on Twitter and subtweet vampires before I go out and

45:06.580 --> 45:09.860
try, because I also don't want to, is it still murder?

45:09.860 --> 45:12.100
Because my answer is yeah, kind of.

45:12.100 --> 45:13.540
Yeah, probably.

45:13.540 --> 45:18.100
You could go to their bank and just be like, hey, this guy's a vampire.

45:18.100 --> 45:20.100
Oh yeah, that's a great way to kill them.

45:20.100 --> 45:22.020
Just blow up their spot everywhere.

45:22.020 --> 45:25.940
Like they're just like walking down the street and you're just driving slowly next to them

45:25.940 --> 45:29.380
in your car with the windows down like, hey everybody, that's a vampire.

45:30.420 --> 45:35.220
I'm sorry, but Dr. Acula has been coming to this branch for many years and we've never

45:35.220 --> 45:36.820
had any problems with him.

45:36.820 --> 45:38.500
We're going to have to ask you to leave.

45:38.500 --> 45:41.300
He's a treasured, he's a treasured customer.

45:42.260 --> 45:44.580
Juice, will you do this next question before we wrap up?

45:45.780 --> 45:46.900
Happily, Griff.

45:46.900 --> 45:53.940
Just now, in the airport restroom, a man a few urinals down from me stopped peeing, moved

45:53.940 --> 45:58.100
one urinal over to his left, and then continued to pee.

45:59.140 --> 46:00.740
Why did he do this?

46:00.740 --> 46:02.740
That's from befuddled in the bathroom.

46:05.060 --> 46:07.220
Let's just, let's just, should we just round Robin?

46:07.940 --> 46:10.340
Just list a reason why you would do, because we've all been there.

46:10.980 --> 46:12.100
The urinal was full.

46:12.740 --> 46:14.100
Urinal's full, Travis says.

46:14.100 --> 46:14.980
Justin, you got one?

46:14.980 --> 46:19.140
He saw that there was a new urinal cake in the next one, and he just couldn't resist

46:19.140 --> 46:20.820
the temptation to destroy it.

46:20.820 --> 46:22.660
Yeah, I mean, urinal spider.

46:22.660 --> 46:23.860
You see one, you gotta go.

46:25.460 --> 46:26.900
It's probably one of those three.

46:27.620 --> 46:30.900
I mean, it also could be a game in Japan.

46:30.900 --> 46:34.740
When I was there for my honeymoon, there's some places that have like games built into

46:34.740 --> 46:41.700
the toilet where, you know, you pee and maybe you're peeing on a target, or it's measuring

46:41.700 --> 46:45.300
your sort of fluid, and then you get a high score.

46:45.300 --> 46:51.620
Maybe he already beat the game, wanted a fresh save file, maybe a new game plus, pop one

46:51.620 --> 46:52.100
over.

46:52.100 --> 46:55.860
Maybe it's a different game, he's like, oh no, this one's a driving game, I want a

46:55.860 --> 46:56.900
punching game.

46:56.900 --> 46:59.220
So he went over to play a different piss game.

47:00.260 --> 47:04.420
Maybe he realized right in the middle that it wasn't a urinal at all, but in fact a

47:04.420 --> 47:07.140
mimic who was trying to eat him.

47:07.140 --> 47:08.980
A nasty mimic who loves pee pee.

47:08.980 --> 47:12.660
Yeah, maybe he filled it up.

47:13.540 --> 47:14.020
Travis already did that one.

47:14.020 --> 47:16.100
That was the first one I said, yeah.

47:16.100 --> 47:17.060
Yeah, I'm just agreeing.

47:21.460 --> 47:23.940
I just wanted to lend a little credence to my brother.

47:23.940 --> 47:24.260
Yeah.

47:25.140 --> 47:26.660
Maybe he did fill it up.

47:28.260 --> 47:31.140
Maybe there's borrowers in it, and they didn't see him at first.

47:31.140 --> 47:32.820
He was like, oh, sorry little friend.

47:35.460 --> 47:37.780
I'm sorry buddy, let me scoot one over.

47:37.780 --> 47:39.780
Piss, piss, piss, oh there's one in here too.

47:39.780 --> 47:40.340
It's okay.

47:41.380 --> 47:44.980
I knew it was risky when I moved in here, I knew that this was going to come with the

47:44.980 --> 47:45.620
territory.

47:46.420 --> 47:51.220
Maybe his goal was to try to pee in all of them in the same thing, and he just didn't,

47:51.220 --> 47:53.220
like he didn't pace himself well enough.

47:53.220 --> 47:57.540
I mean, I mean that's, maybe he was playing Pokemon Go, and there was a ghastly like four

47:57.540 --> 47:58.660
feet to his left.

47:58.660 --> 48:02.420
Did you see a Guinness World Records person next to him like, you'll never do it.

48:04.340 --> 48:05.460
Not with that stream.

48:05.460 --> 48:15.220
Question, do you enclose your zone before you transfer, or do you let her ride?

48:15.220 --> 48:19.380
Well, they, I mean, they said they stopped peeing, which is good.

48:19.380 --> 48:20.260
That's a mercy.

48:20.260 --> 48:24.020
Yeah, that's, obviously you want that to be done, but what I'm saying is there's a few

48:24.020 --> 48:24.980
steps after that.

48:26.180 --> 48:30.740
Yeah, you gotta make the audible whoop sound as you move over to the next one.

48:30.740 --> 48:38.340
Do you, I'm asking if he put his zone away before he transferred, or was it a full, was

48:38.340 --> 48:43.140
he trying to keep his combo meter going maybe, and he wanted to, you know, complete the gap?

48:44.260 --> 48:45.620
I assume it went like this.

48:45.620 --> 48:50.500
He left it out, he looked to his left, he was like, Doug, Doug, is that you here?

48:50.500 --> 48:52.420
And then went over to that one and started peeing in it.

48:52.420 --> 48:56.260
I don't think he put his wiener away, but I do think he recognized the urinal and thought

48:56.260 --> 48:58.820
it would be rude to not go pee in it.

48:58.820 --> 49:02.260
Yeah, it's gotta be that, or the borrower, or you filled it up.

49:03.060 --> 49:07.460
It's either he, right, it's either he had filled it up, there was a borrower in it,

49:08.180 --> 49:12.100
or he recognized the urinal and called it by name.

49:14.020 --> 49:17.860
If you know the urinal and you're friends with it enough to know its name, then do you

49:17.860 --> 49:19.620
not want to do the business in it?

49:19.620 --> 49:22.100
You don't want to deny the urinal its purpose.

49:22.100 --> 49:23.780
I mean, that's what it's there for.

49:23.780 --> 49:24.580
Yes, it's true.

49:24.580 --> 49:30.180
Man, everything's just so political these days.

49:38.900 --> 49:43.300
Well, friends, I think we can all agree that this was a podcast.

49:43.300 --> 49:43.540
Yep.

49:44.340 --> 49:46.020
We made a guarantee at the beginning.

49:46.740 --> 49:49.460
Yeah, started, now it's gonna end.

49:49.460 --> 49:53.060
There's a beginning, middle, end, and the middle was when we sold advertisements, and

49:53.060 --> 49:57.220
then before was everything before it, and the end was everything after it, and then

49:57.220 --> 49:59.700
you heard roughly an hour of three people talking.

50:00.740 --> 50:01.380
That's a podcast.

50:01.380 --> 50:02.740
That's a podcast, baby.

50:02.740 --> 50:03.460
Cut and print.

50:04.020 --> 50:05.060
Walk us out, Juice.

50:05.620 --> 50:06.660
Thank you for listening.

50:06.660 --> 50:08.100
We really appreciate you.

50:08.100 --> 50:14.420
Sorry about, I mean everything, but sickness and traveling and everything, and we missed

50:14.420 --> 50:16.660
last week, and we're just real sorry, but we'll do better.

50:16.660 --> 50:19.140
We'll do a better job in 2018.

50:19.140 --> 50:22.900
I don't know, because I've been sick literally every day of 2018 so far.

50:22.900 --> 50:31.300
So it would be, I miss having a good, cool, functioning, non-medicine sort of poisoned

50:31.300 --> 50:31.620
brain.

50:33.620 --> 50:37.300
Thank you to everybody who's sending questions.

50:37.300 --> 50:38.820
We've never done that before, but thanks.

50:40.420 --> 50:45.060
You all saved me from having to wander into that fucking pit myself, and I sure do appreciate

50:45.060 --> 50:45.300
you.

50:45.300 --> 50:53.380
Mabimbanatmaximumfund.org is the address if you want to send a query there.

50:53.380 --> 50:57.060
In that same vein, I want to say thank you to everybody who came out at Sketchfest to

50:57.060 --> 50:58.580
see my shows.

50:58.580 --> 50:59.780
They all went very well.

51:00.820 --> 51:01.780
Thank you for coming.

51:01.780 --> 51:08.100
I wanted to let everybody know that January 25th, I'm going to be in the John and Jean

51:08.100 --> 51:09.220
show in Brooklyn.

51:09.860 --> 51:10.820
I'll be tweeting about that.

51:10.820 --> 51:11.860
Jesus, Travis.

51:11.860 --> 51:15.380
Yeah, it's John Hodgman and Jean Grey, and I'm going to do that.

51:15.380 --> 51:20.580
And then we have the cruise coming up in February, February 18th through the 25th.

51:21.540 --> 51:22.660
JoCo Cruise.

51:22.660 --> 51:24.340
It's going to be super fun.

51:24.340 --> 51:27.860
You can find that out at JOCocruise.com.

51:28.500 --> 51:30.820

you about because I'm about to cough, which I'm going to edit out.

51:39.540 --> 51:40.180
Heat Rocks.

51:40.180 --> 51:42.980
There's a new one on the network.

51:42.980 --> 51:43.940
From John Roderick.

51:43.940 --> 51:49.540
Friendly Fire, it is called, where they talk about war movies.

51:49.540 --> 51:51.460
I was just talking with Roderick about it yesterday.

51:51.460 --> 51:52.580
It sounds super interesting.

51:52.580 --> 51:53.300
How is that dude?

51:53.300 --> 51:53.860
I miss him.

51:54.420 --> 51:55.060
Doing good.

51:55.060 --> 51:58.740
He was sick for a couple days, but now he's better and has a really cool shirt.

52:00.020 --> 52:00.740
He got that for-

52:01.540 --> 52:02.820
Do you get cool shirts?

52:02.820 --> 52:06.420
If you get a cool shirt when you get over an illness, then I've got the coolest shirt

52:06.420 --> 52:08.340
ever coming my way.

52:08.340 --> 52:11.860
Hey, speaking of John Roderick, thanks to that good dude for letting us use our theme

52:11.860 --> 52:15.780
song, It's a Departure, off the Long Winter's album, Putting the Days to Bed.

52:15.780 --> 52:19.380
It's a really, really fantastic album that you're just going to love.

52:19.380 --> 52:22.020
And that's going to do it for us, folks, this week.

52:22.020 --> 52:23.140
So thank you for listening.

52:23.140 --> 52:26.260
And Griffin's got one final Yahoo to sort of take us out on.

52:26.260 --> 52:28.420
Yeah, this final one was sent in by Merit Palmer.

52:28.420 --> 52:28.980
Thank you, Merit.

52:28.980 --> 52:31.860
It's Yahoo Answers user GangsterGhost who asks,

52:31.860 --> 52:37.940
Do you believe in Da Vinci code?

52:37.940 --> 52:39.140
My name is Justin McElroy.

52:39.140 --> 52:40.660
I'm Travis McElroy.

52:40.660 --> 52:41.940
I'm Griffin McElroy.

52:41.940 --> 52:43.460
This has been my brother, my brother, and me.

52:43.460 --> 53:02.660
Kiss your dad's square on the lips.

53:13.860 --> 53:17.300
to you about our new podcast on Maximum Fun, Friendly Fire.

53:17.300 --> 53:22.420
The podcast about action movies and Sylvester Stallone specifically.

53:23.460 --> 53:25.140
It's the show I've always wanted to make.

53:25.780 --> 53:26.580
It is not that.

53:26.580 --> 53:27.940
It is not that at all.

53:27.940 --> 53:31.620
It's a little bit more of a war movie podcast.

53:31.620 --> 53:33.780
It's not a little bit more of a war movie podcast.

53:33.780 --> 53:36.340
It is explicitly a war movie podcast.

53:36.340 --> 53:42.260
We look at them from all sides and put them in a variety of cultural and historical contexts

53:42.260 --> 53:45.380
such that anyone is going to enjoy this show.

53:45.380 --> 54:12.660
