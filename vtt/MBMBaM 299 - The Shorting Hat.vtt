00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:47.280
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me,

00:47.280 --> 00:52.000
an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. Welcome

00:52.880 --> 00:57.360
to the end of volume one. I'm your middle brother, Travis McElroy.

00:57.360 --> 00:58.640
I'm your sweet baby brother.

00:58.640 --> 01:02.000
That's the sound of the cover closing on the book.

01:02.960 --> 01:10.320
I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy. That's the time portal, period.

01:10.320 --> 01:11.520
That's the time portal.

01:11.520 --> 01:13.040
Please don't look into the time portal.

01:13.040 --> 01:18.240
Holy shit, don't look into the time portal. Because if you are looking back at yourself

01:18.240 --> 01:22.240
from the future, total, total collapse. Total time collapse.

01:22.240 --> 01:26.080
When you look into the time portal, sometimes the time portal looks back and says,

01:26.080 --> 01:30.000
please stop looking in my portal. Please stop looking at me, you,

01:30.000 --> 01:32.880
and then we have a full-blown TTC, and then the singularity.

01:33.440 --> 01:39.040
Welcome to the end of My Brother, My Brother, and Me, volume one, as we like to think of it.

01:39.040 --> 01:43.440
Wait, so the first season of My Brother, My Brother, and Me ended on episode 200.

01:43.440 --> 01:50.960
Right, there's six seasons in a volume, and then three volumes in a book, so this is, yeah.

01:51.840 --> 01:53.920
Okay, so we're still in book one.

01:53.920 --> 01:56.480
Seven books in the Chronicle of Narnia.

01:56.480 --> 01:56.800
Gotcha.

01:56.800 --> 02:00.320
Welcome to the Chronicles of Narnia. I'm your host, Mr. Tumnus.

02:00.320 --> 02:01.920
I'm your host, Aslan.

02:02.880 --> 02:07.840
I'm your host, Tummy Tumnus, his son.

02:07.840 --> 02:09.360
His son, Tummy Tumnus.

02:10.880 --> 02:16.320
Yeah, we've been doing this show for 298 times before this.

02:17.680 --> 02:20.720
Is it actually more? Does that count all of them? Does that count like Totinos and-

02:20.720 --> 02:22.480
No, I don't think it counts as a bonus episode.

02:22.480 --> 02:24.480
We have bonus episodes.

02:24.480 --> 02:27.680
Yeah, we've done this shit more than three hundos, but let's fake it, I guess.

02:27.680 --> 02:33.760
We had the non-canonical ones that we had to seal away in that vault to be studied by top men.

02:33.760 --> 02:34.720
The Elseworlds.

02:34.720 --> 02:40.800
We had the super homophobic episodes, and we put those into the episode furnace to power our hate ship.

02:41.520 --> 02:48.480
We had the super jugglerphobic episodes, and we sent them to the Library of Congress so they'd be kept-

02:48.480 --> 02:49.680
Enchrined.

02:49.680 --> 02:53.440
Enchrined in wherever truisms are kept.

02:53.440 --> 02:57.440
Let's look, let's do a quick look backward, and then a quick look forward, because I imagine-

02:57.440 --> 03:00.560
And then a look down, and then a look to your left, and a look to your right.

03:00.560 --> 03:03.040
One of these podcasts will not make it to 400.

03:03.600 --> 03:05.440
One of these podcasts will die.

03:06.400 --> 03:10.480
I think we should, we're gonna do a lot of celebrating in 300.

03:10.480 --> 03:13.200
Should we? I have an idea. Do you guys want to hear the idea?

03:13.840 --> 03:14.240
Yes.

03:14.240 --> 03:14.720
Yeah.

03:14.720 --> 03:21.600
Episode 300, I think we should wear some sort of leather harness.

03:21.600 --> 03:29.360
Maybe we get back in touch with Extreme Restraints and see if they will send us some sort of leather-studded loincloth situation?

03:29.360 --> 03:36.000
And then we record the 300 episode topless, and we just like baby oil ourselves up, up there.

03:36.560 --> 03:40.960
And then down there, down there, it's a leather-studded sort of loincloth situation.

03:40.960 --> 03:43.920
Up here, super duper slippery muscles.

03:43.920 --> 03:47.280
See, Griffin, that is a complete opposite direction.

03:47.280 --> 03:53.120
Well, you know, I'm gonna say it's more of a parallel direction I was going to go,

03:53.120 --> 03:58.480
which I was gonna say we adopt episode 300 to 399.

03:58.480 --> 04:02.240
The subtitle of all the episodes is Coastin to 400.

04:03.680 --> 04:08.000
Okay, so you're sort of paving a road, a mental road out in front of us.

04:08.000 --> 04:12.560
I can see this beautiful highway stretching, and it is a fucking easy highway.

04:12.560 --> 04:17.440
We'll just think like the first 300 were us clicking up, you know, the roller coaster,

04:18.000 --> 04:23.040
and then 300 to 399 is all downhill.

04:23.040 --> 04:26.560
Well, except, well, yes, it'd be literate, like nobody would listen to that.

04:27.120 --> 04:31.360
If we did, if we put, how did you, you paint me this picture, Travis,

04:31.360 --> 04:34.720
of how we would spend less time working on this show.

04:34.720 --> 04:39.680
How we would, how we would endeavor a smaller amount of effort into the creation of this podcast.

04:39.680 --> 04:44.000
Each week, we would only publish two of the three audio tracks from each of us.

04:44.560 --> 04:47.760
I mean, we could do this right now, because I still have a Bim Bam Portland

04:47.760 --> 04:49.840
of our Portland live show, Elder Gods.

04:49.840 --> 04:52.640
That's the art-seasonal, like, hipster one where it's like,

04:52.640 --> 04:56.080
oh, I like the episodes where you can't make out anything that somebody said.

04:56.080 --> 05:00.720
Well, it's the one for people who hate Travis, which is there's not any of them.

05:00.720 --> 05:01.680
There's nobody, everybody loves Travis.

05:01.680 --> 05:03.120
Everybody loves Travis, fact.

05:03.760 --> 05:05.280
There's fewer than there used to be.

05:06.400 --> 05:08.720
Well, I've been campaigning pretty hard.

05:08.720 --> 05:10.400
I've been hitting the old trail.

05:10.960 --> 05:14.720
VR, PR, kissing all those babies and what have you.

05:16.000 --> 05:19.200
Yeah, this has been two or nine episodes in pretty much the same way.

05:19.200 --> 05:27.840
Griffin, what do you envision as sort of like, as we open up volume two of this book next week?

05:27.840 --> 05:30.000
Don't open it yet, Travis, close it back.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.040
Wait, shit, I broke it.

05:32.720 --> 05:33.840
How do you break a book?

05:34.560 --> 05:37.760
I broke it right in half, like an 1800 strong man.

05:37.760 --> 05:38.260
Oh, boy.

05:39.680 --> 05:42.960
So, how do you envision the show changing into-

05:42.960 --> 05:46.320
More stunts, more sex, more-

05:46.320 --> 05:47.360
More sex stunts.

05:47.920 --> 05:48.960
More sex stunts.

05:49.680 --> 05:52.800
Where you get your wiener out and you spin on it like a top.

05:52.800 --> 05:54.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:55.040 --> 05:56.560
And then what else?

05:57.200 --> 06:00.160
New friends, new Pokemon.

06:02.400 --> 06:04.880
You'll get to learn Griffin's third evolution.

06:04.880 --> 06:07.520
Bigger challenges, hotter-

06:07.520 --> 06:08.320
Wetter.

06:08.320 --> 06:12.880
Hotter summers, bigger challenges, cooler nights.

06:15.120 --> 06:16.000
Wetter.

06:16.000 --> 06:16.480
What's that?

06:17.040 --> 06:17.760
Just wetter.

06:17.760 --> 06:18.480
Just wetter.

06:18.480 --> 06:19.200
Wetter, yeah.

06:19.200 --> 06:19.520
Just like-

06:19.520 --> 06:20.960
Is that what that means to you?

06:22.720 --> 06:23.220
Wetter.

06:24.720 --> 06:27.200
I'm gonna get stronger, I'll get stronger.

06:27.200 --> 06:31.520
I don't know how that's gonna reflect in the show, but if I need to start going to the gym

06:31.520 --> 06:36.720
and increase my lift weight to just keep things fresh and interesting, I can do that.

06:36.720 --> 06:39.600
And maybe I'll just stand up once an episode and pick up a heavy thing

06:39.600 --> 06:40.960
and that'll be a fun new bit.

06:40.960 --> 06:42.320
New bits, definitely new bits.

06:42.880 --> 06:46.880
What if we added a storyline, an overall arc,

06:46.880 --> 06:50.400
where it's like maybe this episode, along with all the goofs and stuff,

06:50.400 --> 06:54.880
you also find out that Griffin is having some trouble with a coworker.

06:54.880 --> 06:55.920
Yeah, sure.

06:55.920 --> 07:00.080
And by episode 400, maybe it's a zombie thing.

07:00.080 --> 07:09.600
Our attempt at a coherent storyline back around the Powerade days,

07:10.160 --> 07:14.800
it was so very, very successful and entertaining that I definitely-

07:14.800 --> 07:16.320
Well, we had that spinoff series.

07:17.440 --> 07:18.800
I would love to return to that.

07:18.800 --> 07:20.480
Yeah, it went so, so good.

07:21.840 --> 07:26.160
I think all that is waiting for us and more, still waiting on a confirmation,

07:26.160 --> 07:32.400
a dedication to the Slippery Boy record environment for episode 300.

07:32.400 --> 07:36.000
And then we're going to make so many fun 300 jokes.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.200
Oh, I see.

07:38.240 --> 07:38.640
What did you think I was talking about?

07:38.640 --> 07:41.920
I thought you were just pitching like a weird sex thing.

07:41.920 --> 07:46.560
You are making a reference to the hit mind-bending film 300.

07:46.560 --> 07:48.080
Was it mind-bending?

07:48.080 --> 07:50.560
Well, there was a lot of weird issues.

07:50.560 --> 07:54.720
There were people with elephant heads and monsters,

07:54.720 --> 07:59.840
but it was also kind of real, but it was also kind of a monster thing.

07:59.840 --> 08:04.000
And then there was, you remember the things in the movie

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
that were kind of real, but kind of weren't.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.360
You're like, what is this history?

08:08.080 --> 08:12.160
My only problem with this is I don't think we have baby oil here at the house.

08:12.720 --> 08:14.560
And I'm not going to go buy baby oil

08:14.560 --> 08:16.720
because that checkout process is going to be uncomfortable.

08:16.720 --> 08:17.680
What do you need this for?

08:17.680 --> 08:18.320
You have a baby?

08:19.120 --> 08:20.080
Yes.

08:20.080 --> 08:22.720
Especially if you just buy baby oil and nothing else.

08:22.720 --> 08:25.680
So you clearly drove to the place

08:25.680 --> 08:29.200
and then you just get one bottle and you put it down in front.

08:29.200 --> 08:31.120
You don't even do self-checkout.

08:31.120 --> 08:34.480
You go to the one person working at two o'clock in the afternoon.

08:34.480 --> 08:36.000
You make sure they know right now.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.680
So I'll probably just use Vic's vapor rub.

08:40.320 --> 08:41.120
Perfect.

08:41.120 --> 08:41.920
This is a-

08:41.920 --> 08:45.520
I'll turn the ceiling fan and the air conditioner on a full blast

08:45.520 --> 08:48.960
and just be connected with the universe.

08:48.960 --> 08:49.760
You know what I mean?

08:49.760 --> 08:52.880
Be so aware, so woke, so woke.

08:52.880 --> 08:55.440
Last week I was walking my dog in the woods

08:55.440 --> 08:58.960
and I stumbled across a pair of very nice sunglasses.

08:58.960 --> 09:01.760
They were simply laying by the side of the trail.

09:01.760 --> 09:03.520
I looked around, but saw no other people.

09:04.080 --> 09:07.200
I also did not see a dead body to whom they might belong.

09:07.200 --> 09:08.320
Kind of a weird place to go.

09:09.520 --> 09:11.760
I broke my sunglasses that day.

09:12.480 --> 09:16.160
So under the assumption that fate had shown upon me, I took them.

09:17.200 --> 09:17.840
Am I good?

09:17.840 --> 09:20.240
That's from Polarized Peepers.

09:20.240 --> 09:20.960
Jesus.

09:20.960 --> 09:24.240
I would be so afraid of an Eyes of Kid Midas situation here.

09:24.240 --> 09:25.120
Oh my God, yes.

09:25.120 --> 09:25.680
Have you made-

09:25.680 --> 09:26.960
How many wishes have you made?

09:26.960 --> 09:27.460
What?

09:28.000 --> 09:28.500
What?

09:29.360 --> 09:30.640
Eyes of Kid Midas?

09:31.360 --> 09:31.860
Yeah.

09:32.400 --> 09:34.720
Sorry, I'm not familiar with Eyes of Kid Midas.

09:34.720 --> 09:39.760
A kid finds sunglasses on a plateau in the woods

09:39.760 --> 09:43.920
after being bullied and then finds he has like magic wishing powers

09:43.920 --> 09:46.480
that, oh, spoiler alert, all turn out bad.

09:46.480 --> 09:48.640
It's kind of like Hatchet, but for a boy's face.

09:48.640 --> 09:49.140
Yes.

09:51.120 --> 09:54.560
I can't believe the cracks in my cultural literacy begin here

09:54.560 --> 09:56.800
and they begin with the Eyes of Kid Midas.

09:56.800 --> 09:57.040
Yeah.

09:57.040 --> 09:58.880
This is where I start to lose my cool.

09:58.880 --> 10:01.680
Here's a short list of places where if you find sunglasses,

10:02.400 --> 10:05.040
you need to return them to who they might belong to.

10:05.040 --> 10:06.080
A, a friend's house.

10:06.080 --> 10:08.480
You didn't find those.

10:10.320 --> 10:13.680
You've stolen them because they were where they were.

10:13.680 --> 10:14.880
That's just where they put them.

10:14.880 --> 10:16.720
B, a friend's head.

10:16.720 --> 10:20.000
Yeah, don't, yeah, now you've, that's the worst one you could have done.

10:20.560 --> 10:22.000
A sunglasses store.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.240
A sunglasses store that's shoplifting.

10:24.240 --> 10:27.200
Again, it's not, not that big a deal.

10:27.680 --> 10:29.760
And that's why it's C on the list, not A.

10:32.160 --> 10:32.960
How about this?

10:32.960 --> 10:35.440
How about a Shoney's or an Olive Garden?

10:35.440 --> 10:36.720
You take that to the manager.

10:36.720 --> 10:37.520
Hi, I found this.

10:37.520 --> 10:38.560
Can I get a free breadstick?

10:39.520 --> 10:40.640
The answer to that is yes.

10:40.640 --> 10:42.400
We'll do that no matter what.

10:42.400 --> 10:45.680
No matter what, regardless of the sunglasses situation.

10:47.360 --> 10:49.200
It's not a one in one out policy.

10:50.160 --> 10:51.280
Welcome to Fizzoli's.

10:51.280 --> 10:52.240
I'd like some breadsticks.

10:52.240 --> 10:54.480
That'll be six pairs of sunglasses, right?

10:56.480 --> 10:56.800
Here's a list of-

10:56.800 --> 11:00.000
What if someone had brought those to like shield their eyes

11:00.000 --> 11:01.920
as they, from the sauce mess.

11:01.920 --> 11:03.280
Like just as they were plowing through piles of-

11:03.280 --> 11:05.120
You don't want to get that shit.

11:05.120 --> 11:05.600
Exactly.

11:06.880 --> 11:07.840
You'll be sauce blind.

11:07.840 --> 11:10.000
You'll go sauce blind for at least six days.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.280
And then you won't be able to see sauce.

11:11.280 --> 11:12.640
Boy, a heartbreaking thing.

11:12.640 --> 11:14.720
Oh man, this spaghetti's wetter than I thought it would be

11:14.720 --> 11:15.840
and more flavorful.

11:15.840 --> 11:16.720
It's all just gray.

11:17.440 --> 11:17.680
Okay.

11:18.720 --> 11:23.440
List of places where, if you find sunglasses,

11:24.400 --> 11:25.840
do not need to do anything.

11:25.840 --> 11:28.800
A, outside anywhere.

11:30.080 --> 11:30.880
End of list.

11:31.440 --> 11:34.640
But Griffin, what if the question is not one of morality,

11:34.640 --> 11:38.320
but one of hygiene or, you know, sunglass spirits?

11:39.840 --> 11:41.040
Haunted, okay.

11:41.040 --> 11:41.360
Yeah.

11:41.360 --> 11:43.280
And go, so I didn't even consider that, Trav.

11:43.280 --> 11:44.080
Haunted sunglasses.

11:44.080 --> 11:45.280
But what if you're afraid of like sunglass mites?

11:46.160 --> 11:46.720
Not a thing.

11:47.520 --> 11:49.440
You just can like pop them on your face.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.280
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:52.160 --> 11:58.960
You basically participated in like a one person litter cleanup project.

11:58.960 --> 12:01.600
It's like a special geocache just for you.

12:02.240 --> 12:03.120
Exactly right.

12:03.120 --> 12:04.160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:04.160 --> 12:07.040
You didn't know who hid it, but you do know who found it.

12:07.040 --> 12:07.600
And it's you.

12:07.600 --> 12:08.400
If it makes you feel any better-

12:08.400 --> 12:11.360
You just got a saw in the ground where you found it and then walk away.

12:11.920 --> 12:13.280
Before you pick them up, say,

12:13.280 --> 12:14.800
hey, thanks everybody for coming out.

12:15.920 --> 12:19.280
We hope to have a really good impact today.

12:19.280 --> 12:21.200
And then you pick up the sunglasses and say,

12:21.200 --> 12:22.880
well, that's going to do it for us, guys.

12:22.880 --> 12:23.920
I think we're all pretty bushed.

12:24.560 --> 12:27.440
Vicky brought pizza that's in her back of her truck.

12:27.440 --> 12:28.480
It's a soda pop.

12:28.480 --> 12:31.600
If you want some soda pop pizza that's available,

12:31.600 --> 12:33.280
I hope you'll come out with me next time.

12:33.280 --> 12:34.160
They're sunglasses.

12:34.160 --> 12:36.960
Are there really any items of value out here in the forest?

12:36.960 --> 12:38.640
I lost my clean canteen,

12:38.640 --> 12:42.480
so everybody keep an eye out for some litter that looks like a clean canteen.

12:42.480 --> 12:44.400
Also, it doesn't seem to be any trash cans right here.

12:44.400 --> 12:46.240
So when you're done with that soda pop of pizza,

12:46.240 --> 12:48.800
you can just throw the bottles just like wherever the fuck you want, man.

12:50.400 --> 12:50.800
Whatever.

12:50.800 --> 12:53.200
There's a lot of woods out here, so nobody will ever find it.

12:53.200 --> 12:53.840
The fact-

12:53.840 --> 12:56.720
Don't pollute unless you have to and then fuck it.

12:56.720 --> 12:57.760
Because there's no trash can.

12:59.120 --> 12:59.680
Here's the thing.

13:00.400 --> 13:03.200
I mean, you can take the glasses, take them, take them, take them.

13:03.200 --> 13:07.760
If the sunlight is shining on them and you're not in a friend's house, take the glasses.

13:07.760 --> 13:08.640
They want to be worn.

13:08.640 --> 13:09.920
They want to protect you from that sun.

13:11.200 --> 13:16.160
The other thing is if your glasses broke that day, this is a gift.

13:16.160 --> 13:18.640
This is some forces come together.

13:18.640 --> 13:19.920
Maybe it's serendipity.

13:19.920 --> 13:21.040
Maybe it's sliding doors.

13:21.920 --> 13:23.040
Maybe it's better off dead.

13:24.000 --> 13:24.560
Maybe it's-

13:25.120 --> 13:26.000
Must love dogs.

13:26.560 --> 13:28.320
Maybe it's the Matrix trilogy.

13:28.320 --> 13:29.040
I don't know what it is.

13:29.040 --> 13:30.800
I don't think John Cusack's in that one.

13:31.440 --> 13:33.040
The forces have come together.

13:33.040 --> 13:35.360
To give you these sunglasses because they want to protect your eyes.

13:35.360 --> 13:38.400
Because maybe in the future, we're going to need your eyes.

13:38.400 --> 13:39.040
You know what I mean?

13:40.240 --> 13:44.480
We're all parts of a much bigger machine.

13:44.480 --> 13:48.480
And like a cog can't tell like, oh man, I'm inside of a gun.

13:48.480 --> 13:49.600
They just know they're a cog.

13:50.160 --> 13:50.640
And a gun.

13:51.200 --> 13:52.240
You know what I mean?

13:52.240 --> 13:52.560
Yeah.

13:52.560 --> 13:53.040
But they are-

13:53.040 --> 13:54.240
I do want to make this super clear.

13:54.240 --> 13:55.760
They're definitely sentient though, right?

13:55.760 --> 13:57.040
Like we can all agree on that.

13:57.040 --> 13:58.240
The cogs are all aware.

13:58.240 --> 13:59.120
Yes, yes, yes.

13:59.120 --> 14:00.080
Okay, cool.

14:00.080 --> 14:01.120
That's something to make sure.

14:01.120 --> 14:01.920
How about a Yahoo?

14:01.920 --> 14:03.200
I'd love that.

14:03.200 --> 14:04.240
I'd love that.

14:04.240 --> 14:06.240
I think that would go down real smooth.

14:06.240 --> 14:08.640
I want to bring this one up and then we'll do another one.

14:08.640 --> 14:10.560
Because this one's not really much of a discussion topic.

14:10.560 --> 14:14.240
But I think, you know, celebrating the first book, the first volume.

14:14.880 --> 14:17.200
I wanted to read this one from Ben Shreve.

14:17.200 --> 14:20.640
It's from Yahoo Answers user question mark who asks.

14:21.920 --> 14:25.200
Are you all aware that we are the laughing stock of the internet?

14:28.480 --> 14:30.560
Many people take Yahoo Answers as a joke.

14:30.560 --> 14:31.440
They're right, of course.

14:31.440 --> 14:32.320
But it still hurts.

14:34.800 --> 14:35.680
Oh, God.

14:35.680 --> 14:36.640
Oh, God.

14:36.640 --> 14:39.840
So that closes the book on Yahoo Answers.

14:40.400 --> 14:41.840
God, we had a lot of fun out here.

14:43.040 --> 14:44.160
Volume one is done.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.120
Can I keep reading this though?

14:47.120 --> 14:48.480
Or is the book like gone?

14:48.480 --> 14:49.120
Do you have a different-

14:49.120 --> 14:51.120
Yeah, I want to hear the rest of it.

14:51.120 --> 14:51.680
Well, there's that-

14:51.680 --> 14:52.480
Do we get a shout out?

14:52.480 --> 14:54.080
Let me just skip to the meat.

14:54.080 --> 14:55.120
Like, do we get a shout out?

14:56.080 --> 14:56.560
To who?

14:57.120 --> 14:57.520
To us.

14:57.520 --> 14:58.240
Like for like-

14:58.240 --> 14:58.880
To us.

14:58.880 --> 15:02.960
Bringing to light the Yahoo Answers like phenomenon.

15:02.960 --> 15:04.400
What, that they're a fucking joke?

15:04.400 --> 15:05.840
That they're a fucking clown pit?

15:06.640 --> 15:08.160
Like, do they use this as an example?

15:08.160 --> 15:12.880
Like one of the most popular and arguably like the first one-

15:13.840 --> 15:14.240
Oh, yeah.

15:14.240 --> 15:15.920
Here it is, here it is, here it is, here it is.

15:17.600 --> 15:18.480
Anonymous said,

15:19.120 --> 15:22.720
Jimmy Fallon does a bit where they sing actual questions and answers from Yahoo Answers.

15:22.720 --> 15:24.160
There are a few oddballs on here.

15:25.840 --> 15:27.360
Wait, that's not us though, Griffin.

15:27.360 --> 15:28.080
We're not-

15:28.080 --> 15:28.960
Yeah, they didn't mention us.

15:28.960 --> 15:29.920
We're not Jimmy Fallon.

15:29.920 --> 15:31.360
And how we changed the game.

15:31.360 --> 15:32.960
And how we actually started the game.

15:33.600 --> 15:34.800
We are the game.

15:34.800 --> 15:36.400
The game is named after us.

15:36.400 --> 15:38.000
The game is inside all of us.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.800
We are game, game is us.

15:41.360 --> 15:42.640
Oh, here's one, here's one, here's one.

15:42.640 --> 15:42.960
Okay.

15:42.960 --> 15:46.640
My Brother, My Brother and Me does a bit where they sing actual questions and answers from Yahoo Answers.

15:46.640 --> 15:48.160
There are a few oddballs on here.

15:48.160 --> 15:48.720
Now hold on.

15:48.720 --> 15:49.520
Okay, now hold on.

15:50.160 --> 15:51.200
I think you just read the-

15:51.760 --> 15:55.360
I wanna be where Jimmy Fallon is.

15:55.360 --> 15:55.680
Okay.

15:55.680 --> 16:00.560
I wanna see, see him play his fun games.

16:00.560 --> 16:01.120
Because he plays a lot of fun games.

16:01.120 --> 16:03.360
Wait, Griffin, if you're saying anymore, we have to pay Disney.

16:03.920 --> 16:04.720
Okay, damn it.

16:05.760 --> 16:08.080
Lots of people are arguing with this sentiment.

16:08.800 --> 16:12.080
SportsMD, which is a fucking great username, says,

16:12.800 --> 16:14.720
Dr. Sports is basically what this man is.

16:14.720 --> 16:15.760
Okay, cool, moving on.

16:16.800 --> 16:20.560
Dr. Sports says, I never seen anyone talk bad about Yahoo.

16:20.560 --> 16:23.200
This is a respectable site where you can learn a lot from.

16:23.200 --> 16:27.760
It's not like Facebook where you post every meal you ate or the people you slept with.

16:27.760 --> 16:33.600
Odd dope guys had sex with Michelle last night, ate some ballin' spaghetti.

16:34.240 --> 16:37.440
Had some amazing risotto, bone down on Tyler.

16:39.040 --> 16:40.000
Another great night.

16:40.000 --> 16:40.880
I had two-

16:40.880 --> 16:44.160
See you guys in the morning when I'll have pancakes and Steven.

16:47.840 --> 16:50.800
Y'all, I had three hot dogs for lunch.

16:50.800 --> 16:53.280
Anyway, here's the lyrics to Mambo, number five.

16:53.280 --> 17:07.760
I had a little comic business, a little side business,

17:08.320 --> 17:12.240
selling comics at the mall from a stand with my friend Tommy.

17:14.160 --> 17:17.360
It was one of those weekend shows where we're selling dad's old comics

17:17.360 --> 17:25.120
and we got a cut of money and we were next to a guy the entire weekend who sold sports cards

17:25.120 --> 17:36.160
and he had a linen jacket that I would pay upwards of $1,000 for this windbreaker, more accurately.

17:36.160 --> 17:41.760
And on the back, it just said Dr. Rice and we were obsessed with him the whole time.

17:41.760 --> 17:43.200
What could that possibly-

17:43.200 --> 17:47.360
As we were leaving, we worked up the courage to ask,

17:48.000 --> 17:50.560
so Dr. Rice, what are you a doctor in?

17:50.560 --> 17:59.680
And he fuckin' dead-eye, straight, cold, looks us square in our young,

17:59.680 --> 18:02.720
impressionable faces and says, sports.

18:04.720 --> 18:05.120
Awesome.

18:07.200 --> 18:10.960
He lived in Huntington, I'm assuming, so every time I go anywhere,

18:10.960 --> 18:14.880
but more in some places, I keep hoping I'll see him again

18:16.960 --> 18:20.720
and just assume that I'll run into him so I can try to buy his jacket.

18:21.520 --> 18:22.240
You may be dead.

18:23.120 --> 18:24.960
Even, it'll probably be cheaper then.

18:24.960 --> 18:26.240
Well, it might be more expensive.

18:26.880 --> 18:28.560
Maybe it's an heirloom now.

18:28.560 --> 18:30.320
Please, Dr. Rice was my father.

18:30.320 --> 18:31.680
Just call me Mr. Sports.

18:33.440 --> 18:35.360
I haven't gone to school for this shit.

18:36.400 --> 18:37.920
I'm a fan, not an expert.

18:37.920 --> 18:41.440
I got another Yahoo here, it was sent in by Aaron Keys or Kiss.

18:42.160 --> 18:44.560
K-Y-S, how do you think that, Keys?

18:45.360 --> 18:45.840
Yeah.

18:45.840 --> 18:47.040
Thank you, Aaron.

18:47.040 --> 18:49.040
It's by Yahoo Answers user question mark.

18:49.040 --> 18:51.680
Hey, is Yahoo Answers slowly being deleted off the internet

18:51.680 --> 18:54.880
and nobody's made me aware of this fact?

18:54.880 --> 19:01.680
I have actually heard a BS from people in the Yahoo Answers organization

19:02.480 --> 19:06.160
or in the Yahoo organization who think there's a possible chance.

19:06.160 --> 19:07.920
This is on our Facebook group, we were talking about this,

19:07.920 --> 19:10.240
that there's a chance that the Yahoo Answers

19:10.240 --> 19:13.440
will just become vestigial and deleted.

19:14.240 --> 19:18.800
I think it's gonna be a sad, long affair.

19:18.800 --> 19:20.800
I think they're gonna drag this execution out.

19:20.800 --> 19:21.760
I don't think they're gonna flip,

19:21.760 --> 19:24.160
I don't think Melissa Mayer is gonna put her foot

19:24.160 --> 19:28.400
on the neck of Yahoo Answers and then just execute the thing.

19:28.400 --> 19:31.840
Will it be like that one group in Sims Online

19:31.840 --> 19:36.400
that stood around altogether as the server was deleted around them?

19:36.400 --> 19:38.560
Yeah, this is the death of a virtual world.

19:38.560 --> 19:43.200
This is like fucking the Star Wars Online apocalypse.

19:43.200 --> 19:45.840
Like this is terrible.

19:45.840 --> 19:47.120
And then it'll be the end of the show, right?

19:47.120 --> 19:48.080
That's the end of Bim Bam?

19:48.640 --> 19:51.200
Yeah, we'll have accomplished our only goal.

19:52.240 --> 19:53.520
Yeah, to bring them down.

19:53.520 --> 19:56.080
It took us longer than really it should have, but hey.

19:56.720 --> 20:00.480
Now, it will be kind of a relief to not have to go there anymore,

20:00.480 --> 20:03.360
I'm assuming, to do something different.

20:03.360 --> 20:05.760
Yeah, I mean, I'm not the one with the fucking waders on

20:05.760 --> 20:07.680
just like diving into the stank anymore.

20:07.680 --> 20:08.560
I got people for that.

20:10.000 --> 20:10.560
Thank you, Aaron.

20:10.560 --> 20:12.560
It's by Yahoo Answers user Question Mark who asks,

20:12.560 --> 20:16.400
how to get my mom, sorry, let me try this again.

20:16.400 --> 20:27.520
How to get me mom to buy me shorts when I haven't worn them for years.

20:27.520 --> 20:32.320
Now, is it possible that he means,

20:32.320 --> 20:35.680
or they mean getting their mother to buy the shorts

20:35.680 --> 20:37.840
they already own that they haven't worn for years?

20:37.840 --> 20:40.080
Like, hey, me mom, buy me shorts.

20:42.800 --> 20:43.680
It'll be a fair price.

20:43.680 --> 20:45.200
They say Dr. Rice on the butt.

20:45.200 --> 20:45.920
Don't you want that?

20:47.040 --> 20:48.000
A thousand dollars.

20:49.680 --> 20:53.600
So when I was little, I remember wearing shorts sometimes.

20:54.800 --> 20:56.080
They were comfortable and easy to wear.

20:56.080 --> 20:58.000
Comfortable and easy to wear.

20:58.000 --> 21:01.600
As I got older and into my later years in primary school,

21:01.600 --> 21:05.680
I wore them less and less until then for some reason,

21:05.680 --> 21:08.960
I went off them completely and ceased to own a pair

21:08.960 --> 21:10.560
when I became like 11.

21:10.560 --> 21:11.120
Since starting secondary school-

21:11.120 --> 21:14.000
When I became a man and put away such childish pants.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.880
Since starting secondary school, I have not worn shorts,

21:16.880 --> 21:19.280
not even for PE or my sports clubs.

21:19.840 --> 21:21.680
You're playing fucking jeans soccer?

21:21.680 --> 21:22.800
What are you talking about?

21:22.800 --> 21:26.320
All of these pinstripe dress pants.

21:26.320 --> 21:26.720
Since then-

21:26.720 --> 21:28.480
All of these all-time bathing suits.

21:28.480 --> 21:31.520
Since then, I've seen other boys in shorts

21:31.520 --> 21:34.320
and at that time sort of half-wished unconsciously

21:34.320 --> 21:36.000
in the back of my mind sometimes.

21:37.840 --> 21:40.320
Okay, I have to read this phrase again.

21:41.120 --> 21:44.880
And at that time sort of half-wished unconsciously

21:44.880 --> 21:48.640
in the back of my mind sometimes that I was wearing those shorts.

21:48.640 --> 21:52.560
That's the least you can want to wear shorts.

21:52.560 --> 21:53.760
What is this feeling?

21:53.760 --> 21:56.000
What is this feeling at the back of my mind?

21:56.000 --> 21:57.520
I can barely grasp.

21:57.520 --> 22:01.520
Aside from explicitly not wanting to wear shorts,

22:01.520 --> 22:02.800
on the spectrum of shorts,

22:02.800 --> 22:06.800
that emotion they just described is like the lowest one you can have.

22:06.800 --> 22:08.320
Hey, Doug, are you okay?

22:08.320 --> 22:09.600
Yeah, yeah, why do you ask?

22:09.600 --> 22:12.240
I just saw a look flit across your face for a brief instant.

22:12.240 --> 22:15.280
It was a microaggression.

22:15.280 --> 22:16.640
It was a microexpression.

22:16.640 --> 22:21.360
And nobody other than like your pastor that raised you

22:21.360 --> 22:26.480
and adopted you from like a baby would be able to detect this emotion.

22:26.480 --> 22:28.880
Like he didn't turn you into a killing machine.

22:28.880 --> 22:29.120
Yeah.

22:29.120 --> 22:33.360
Okay, so cargo shorts, Bermuda shorts, fleece shorts, gym shorts, etc.

22:33.360 --> 22:36.640
Just a quick little list of what some shorts are.

22:37.280 --> 22:40.560
However, the desire was never enough to actually even consider in my mind

22:40.560 --> 22:41.360
wearing them again.

22:41.360 --> 22:43.200
This guy's got a real mind palace.

22:44.000 --> 22:45.200
Got a real library in there.

22:45.200 --> 22:49.760
What hurdle is he overcoming that the desire must be so strong

22:49.760 --> 22:52.880
to overcome his not wearing shorts?

22:52.880 --> 22:53.600
I gotta keep going.

22:53.600 --> 22:54.160
I gotta keep going.

22:54.800 --> 22:59.520
It had sort of became hardwired in my mind that I did not like shorts,

22:59.520 --> 23:01.600
even though when I saw other boys wearing them,

23:01.600 --> 23:05.360
there was a few seconds where I could see myself wearing those shorts.

23:05.360 --> 23:08.960
Thing is, it has sort of become hardwired in my parents' minds too.

23:08.960 --> 23:12.640
As sometimes when we've been out and see a family in shorts or something,

23:12.640 --> 23:16.720
me mom's remarked, we're not a shorts family.

23:20.480 --> 23:22.960
Don't look at them Dylan, they're not one of us.

23:24.560 --> 23:29.200
My mom's remarked, we're not a shorts family or none of us like shorts.

23:34.320 --> 23:37.200
I've seen old photos of my older brother wearing shorts

23:37.200 --> 23:42.000
when he was about 10 to 12 years old before the boat accident.

23:42.000 --> 23:43.520
No, that last part is made up.

23:43.520 --> 23:44.960
And I know it's from his 11th birthday

23:44.960 --> 23:47.200
because someone's forcibly ripping the shorts from him.

23:48.880 --> 23:49.840
In recent years, however,

23:49.840 --> 23:52.720
the desire to wear shorts has sort of slowly returned.

23:53.440 --> 23:54.800
Okay, a little bit more.

23:54.800 --> 23:56.160
Two updates to this question.

23:56.720 --> 23:58.640
I know everything about this person now.

23:58.640 --> 24:01.200
I first started wearing them for PE again

24:01.200 --> 24:04.000
when I borrowed some from the spare kit box.

24:04.000 --> 24:08.000
Basically a box full of old shorts, muddy trainers, etc.

24:08.000 --> 24:14.560
My fucking beautiful dark twisted fantasy, just a box of these forbidden small pants.

24:15.680 --> 24:19.360
Surely no one will notice one of these shirts gone missing.

24:19.360 --> 24:23.200
He cracks that shit open in the fucking like Zelda discovery theme place.

24:24.160 --> 24:24.800
My treasure.

24:24.800 --> 24:27.040
You've got some shorts.

24:27.040 --> 24:30.080
I've taken some home and me mom did discover them

24:30.080 --> 24:31.360
and wonder how they got there.

24:31.360 --> 24:32.960
What the fuck is this?

24:32.960 --> 24:40.640
I learned it from watching you to discover them and wonder how they got there.

24:40.640 --> 24:43.200
But I just said I don't know or something and hid them away.

24:43.200 --> 24:46.800
Now you're thinking, well, why don't you just say I want to wear shorts or something?

24:46.800 --> 24:48.240
Well, it's not so easy.

24:48.240 --> 24:50.720
If I just said that out of the blue, she'd probably faint or something.

24:50.720 --> 24:52.240
She'd be so shocked.

24:52.240 --> 24:55.200
I want to try and sort of bring it up casually in a conversation,

24:55.200 --> 24:56.400
if you know what I mean, but I don't know how.

24:56.400 --> 24:57.360
Can anyone help me out?

24:57.360 --> 24:57.860
Thanks.

24:57.860 --> 25:05.860
Listen, this is just like any other thing that you do when you're a kid.

25:06.500 --> 25:09.540
You're not supposed to do and you have a secret little,

25:09.540 --> 25:11.380
well, you have a secret compartment.

25:11.380 --> 25:16.100
All you two had secret compartments where you kept your dark materials.

25:16.100 --> 25:19.300
And I know what both of them were because I'm a little,

25:19.300 --> 25:23.620
that was my sort of role in the family was a little sneak thief.

25:23.620 --> 25:25.220
And I would sneak in and creep in here.

25:25.220 --> 25:28.020
I would creep in, tap into your sin.

25:28.900 --> 25:32.340
That's what this person needs to get is like a little hideaway junk box

25:32.340 --> 25:33.380
where they keep their shorts.

25:33.380 --> 25:36.260
And then, I mean, you put them in your backpack.

25:36.260 --> 25:38.020
It'll be like the toaster strudels commercial,

25:38.020 --> 25:40.100
where like the mom gives them those shitty ass pop tarts.

25:40.100 --> 25:42.660
And then their friend Dylan is like, here's those toaster strudels.

25:42.660 --> 25:43.780
Hey, what do you do with your pop tarts?

25:43.780 --> 25:45.940
And he opens up the locker and like a million

25:45.940 --> 25:48.420
of the grossest looking pop tarts ever fall out.

25:48.420 --> 25:51.780
It's going to be like that, but with little pants without the sleeves on them.

25:51.780 --> 25:55.940
You need to open some kind of like big brothers, big sisters, like safe place

25:55.940 --> 26:00.020
where like people after 11 can go to like wear shorts.

26:00.740 --> 26:02.340
And like you show up in pants.

26:02.340 --> 26:03.140
And do whatever.

26:03.780 --> 26:05.620
Maybe just lay around and read a book.

26:05.620 --> 26:08.500
Just live their life in shorts.

26:09.300 --> 26:10.180
I have a name for it.

26:10.820 --> 26:11.060
Okay.

26:11.700 --> 26:12.420
Hog shorts.

26:15.140 --> 26:16.100
Sorry, say again?

26:16.100 --> 26:16.820
Hog shorts.

26:16.820 --> 26:18.180
It's for little short wizards.

26:18.900 --> 26:19.780
Okay, so.

26:19.780 --> 26:20.900
Hog shorts, okay.

26:20.900 --> 26:21.540
Okay.

26:21.540 --> 26:23.540
Is there a sorting shorts that you put it on?

26:23.540 --> 26:25.300
It's just like, there's no houses here, man.

26:25.300 --> 26:26.500
Just fucking kick it.

26:26.500 --> 26:28.020
The shorting hat.

26:28.020 --> 26:28.260
Okay.

26:28.260 --> 26:28.980
Thank you.

26:28.980 --> 26:32.500
When Hagrid shows up when you're 11 and your parents are trying to make you wear pants

26:32.500 --> 26:34.580
and you're like, no, you're a shorts boy, Harry.

26:34.580 --> 26:35.300
Come with me.

26:35.300 --> 26:36.660
You're a shorts boy, Harry.

26:36.660 --> 26:39.620
So there's just one house at hog shorts and it's shorts.

26:41.620 --> 26:46.740
No, you can separate it into like cargo, Bermuda, like tear away.

26:47.300 --> 26:48.020
That's fun.

26:48.020 --> 26:48.980
You would be, okay.

26:48.980 --> 26:51.780
Let's, let's real quick go around.

26:51.780 --> 26:52.260
I've got it.

26:52.260 --> 26:53.860
I've got the shorting hat in my hands right now.

26:53.860 --> 26:55.380
I'm about to put it on Travis's head.

26:55.380 --> 26:55.860
Here we go.

26:55.860 --> 26:56.660
Let's put it right.

26:56.660 --> 26:57.620
Tear away.

26:57.620 --> 26:57.940
Wow.

26:57.940 --> 26:58.340
Jesus.

26:58.340 --> 27:00.740
It didn't even need to like think about it at all.

27:00.740 --> 27:01.860
He just like knew.

27:01.860 --> 27:03.540
That is your own personal choice, Griffin.

27:05.460 --> 27:07.300
You had, you had a couple pairs of them.

27:07.860 --> 27:08.260
Oh yeah.

27:08.260 --> 27:09.300
Zipped off of the knee.

27:09.300 --> 27:10.980
It was the, it was like the nineties.

27:15.940 --> 27:16.820
Oh man.

27:16.820 --> 27:20.020
The cool thing to do was unzip it 70% of the way.

27:20.020 --> 27:23.140
So it looked like your pants were just talking and they were just saying,

27:23.140 --> 27:25.380
knee, knee, knee, knee, knee, knee, knee over and over.

27:25.380 --> 27:25.700
Yeah.

27:25.700 --> 27:26.820
It was pretty great.

27:26.820 --> 27:30.020
That was pretty good if you ever wanted to get caught on fences.

27:30.020 --> 27:34.820
Cause it's constantly just a constant getting caught on fence issue.

27:34.820 --> 27:37.220
Would George be the Slytherin of hog shorts?

27:41.940 --> 27:45.540
Yes, because here's the thing about the Slytherin house is that they're all evil

27:45.540 --> 27:47.620
fucks, but they're brilliant.

27:47.620 --> 27:48.260
You know what I mean?

27:48.260 --> 27:50.900
And I see him, I see a person wearing jorts and I go like,

27:51.460 --> 27:54.500
where did you get your advanced post-grad degree?

27:56.900 --> 27:59.220
I won't even go into defending Slytherin by the way.

27:59.220 --> 28:02.260
I'm I we'll talk about that on our after show.

28:02.260 --> 28:03.700
My brother, my brother and you.

28:03.700 --> 28:03.860
Yeah.

28:04.660 --> 28:05.380
Our after show.

28:06.180 --> 28:11.060
And my head cannon in the real Harry Potter house Hufflepuff was just like

28:11.780 --> 28:14.100
shorts require like mandatory.

28:14.100 --> 28:16.020
Like they were the only house that was allowed to wear shorts.

28:16.580 --> 28:19.220
And everybody else was wearing like cool ass robes and like, you know,

28:19.220 --> 28:22.900
British fancy lad long wear, but like house Hufflepuff was just like,

28:23.540 --> 28:24.500
yeah, whatever.

28:24.500 --> 28:25.300
We know what we are.

28:25.300 --> 28:25.940
Yeah.

28:25.940 --> 28:30.260
Hufflepuff just wore shorts and commemorative t-shirts from marathons.

28:30.260 --> 28:31.860
Their uncles didn't run.

28:31.860 --> 28:32.100
Yeah.

28:33.540 --> 28:38.100
They wore shorts and they wore old play t-shirts.

28:38.100 --> 28:40.340
Something tells me Dr. Rice was a Hufflepuff.

28:40.340 --> 28:44.180
There's something about him that rings Hufflepuff to me.

28:44.180 --> 28:45.300
Maybe Ravenclaw.

28:46.100 --> 28:48.260
Hey, I have a great idea for this person.

28:48.260 --> 28:51.940
Why don't they start by wearing pants and every,

28:53.700 --> 28:59.300
let's say two months, they cut a half inch off of the pants.

28:59.300 --> 29:03.220
So on their deathbed, it'll just be gone for their balls.

29:03.220 --> 29:04.660
Finally accrued shorts.

29:04.660 --> 29:09.700
Well, no, at that point it would be just like a very small necklace.

29:10.660 --> 29:14.900
It's just gone all the, they've just unspooled all the way up to the neck.

29:15.460 --> 29:18.580
Hey, here's a good idea nobody ever thinks about.

29:18.580 --> 29:20.500
You buy pants, you buy shorts, right?

29:20.500 --> 29:21.060
Yeah, yeah.

29:21.620 --> 29:23.460
And you buy the shorts cause they only,

29:23.460 --> 29:25.860
you only want them to cover half of your legs, right?

29:25.860 --> 29:27.060
Right, right, right.

29:27.060 --> 29:27.300
Yeah.

29:27.300 --> 29:34.900
Yeah, maybe instead of buying both pants and shorts, we should buy pants

29:36.260 --> 29:42.580
and then just wait for it to get to cause there.

29:43.780 --> 29:46.500
If you buy pants when you're four.

29:46.500 --> 29:48.100
This is gonna be so fucking funny.

29:49.620 --> 29:51.940
Wait, you buy pants when you're four.

29:51.940 --> 29:52.260
Okay.

29:52.260 --> 29:57.460
And then you get older and when you're eight and your legs are twice as long,

29:58.740 --> 30:01.700
you're still wearing those pants, but now they're shorts.

30:02.420 --> 30:06.980
So you like, they convert over time as your legs grow in length.

30:06.980 --> 30:08.420
Do you understand what I'm saying to you?

30:08.420 --> 30:08.980
I do.

30:08.980 --> 30:10.980
And I know what people at home are wondering.

30:10.980 --> 30:13.460
How do the jeans companies continue to make money?

30:13.460 --> 30:17.940
That's easy with the panels that you add into the pants so it fits on the waist.

30:17.940 --> 30:23.860
Right, and also they're like modifiable so you could get like fun characters

30:23.860 --> 30:28.500
from the pockets and you could have them like Velcroed on and off.

30:28.980 --> 30:31.700
And also some of them have drugs.

30:31.700 --> 30:36.100
So they're, they're working at a good profit cause the jean companies also sell drugs now.

30:36.820 --> 30:40.900
Wait, drugs like prescription drugs or drugs like bad, bad, bad, bad.

30:40.900 --> 30:44.740
Doctors, the doctors wouldn't prescribe these with their worst enemies pin.

30:44.740 --> 30:47.380
No, these are some hard, hard drugs.

30:47.380 --> 30:53.540
Hard, hard drugs that have no business at a pharmacy or anywhere in society.

30:54.420 --> 30:56.900
Can I hit you with an inverse idea?

30:56.900 --> 31:00.500
A patented Griffin flip thought.

31:01.220 --> 31:03.540
We're going to have more flip thoughts in volume two.

31:03.540 --> 31:05.140
Yeah, definitely.

31:07.140 --> 31:08.500
Here's my flip idea.

31:08.500 --> 31:16.980
Shorts you put on in the morning when it's warm that expand throughout the day.

31:17.540 --> 31:25.220
So at night when it's cooler, they've grown and encased over your legs and then they,

31:25.220 --> 31:30.100
but then they keep going and eventually they disappear right when you get into bed.

31:30.100 --> 31:31.460
Wait, hold on, hold on.

31:31.460 --> 31:37.060
Are we talking like Venetian shorts that you can unroll or like zip on shorts?

31:37.060 --> 31:42.340
I'm saying this is a fabric that we crush down somehow so that it's shorts length.

31:42.340 --> 31:47.460
And then as you go about the day doing your warm, fun shorts activities,

31:47.460 --> 31:53.620
then the shorts naturally heat up and in doing so it cooks the crushed fabric

31:53.620 --> 31:57.380
and it makes them extend and just sort of consume your legs.

31:57.380 --> 32:03.460
Maybe there's sort of a biophysical nanotechnological sort of thing going on in there.

32:03.460 --> 32:08.980
And then it keeps going and then your legs are protected from the cool moonlight

32:08.980 --> 32:13.060
and then you get in bed, they're gone.

32:13.860 --> 32:14.580
Perfect.

32:15.140 --> 32:19.060
What do I do in the weeks where I have to work nights at the podcast plant?

32:19.700 --> 32:21.220
You just are wearing pants.

32:21.220 --> 32:22.020
You should be wearing pants.

32:22.020 --> 32:24.340
You guys are wearing pants right now, right?

32:25.860 --> 32:29.700
Like you're not wearing shorts like just out of like respect for the process.

32:29.700 --> 32:33.460
The process because we're making a podcast right now.

32:33.460 --> 32:34.020
We're not like-

32:35.540 --> 32:37.380
I am wearing my work shorts.

32:37.380 --> 32:38.180
Important question.

32:38.180 --> 32:38.660
Yeah.

32:38.660 --> 32:39.780
Are there dress shorts?

32:40.500 --> 32:44.100
Are there shorts you could wear to church that someone would be like, yes, yes.

32:44.100 --> 32:44.340
Yes.

32:44.340 --> 32:47.620
If you ever see Jesse Thorn wearing shorts, those are dress shorts.

32:47.620 --> 32:47.860
Okay.

32:47.860 --> 32:49.780
He makes them dress shorts by definition.

32:49.780 --> 32:52.260
And these are the ones you took from him from his house.

32:53.220 --> 32:54.420
We are different sizes.

32:54.420 --> 32:54.900
Thank you.

32:54.900 --> 32:58.260
No, these are just khaki shorts.

32:58.260 --> 33:00.260
How that ass look though?

33:02.260 --> 33:02.580
Sorry?

33:03.220 --> 33:09.300
How does that juicy ass look though?

33:09.300 --> 33:10.660
Good question.

33:10.660 --> 33:13.380
Like all macarons, I do not have a butt.

33:13.380 --> 33:14.500
There's no butt.

33:14.500 --> 33:15.220
Not true?

33:15.860 --> 33:17.380
Don't look like nothing down there.

33:17.380 --> 33:19.700
I'm fucking Rumpy Dumples still skin over here.

33:19.700 --> 33:21.460
I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.

33:21.460 --> 33:22.900
I didn't know about that.

33:22.900 --> 33:24.500
I don't want to know about that.

33:24.500 --> 33:27.940
Mine's just two bladed ass bones.

33:28.660 --> 33:29.940
That's all I've got back there.

33:29.940 --> 33:30.420
That's a shame.

33:31.140 --> 33:31.780
I didn't know that.

33:31.780 --> 33:35.540
I thought we were all just sort of gifted with these fucking like-

33:35.540 --> 33:39.300
We used to, Travis used to be called the bony butt boy.

33:39.300 --> 33:41.380
And you don't get a nickname like the bony-

33:41.380 --> 33:44.260
Till this day by passing strangers.

33:45.700 --> 33:48.420
You don't get a nickname like the bony butt boy without a bony butt.

33:48.420 --> 33:51.060
It was ironic like you call a big guy tiny.

33:52.100 --> 33:52.580
Right.

33:52.580 --> 33:56.500
I wondered why my nickname growing up was always Primo Dumper.

33:57.220 --> 33:58.580
Thought it was because I was regular.

33:59.140 --> 34:03.460
But now I've just intuited it's because I had the good butt genes by which-

34:03.460 --> 34:05.380
And that was a fun double entendre.

34:05.380 --> 34:06.980
And you can expect more of those in volume two.

34:06.980 --> 34:08.020
Should we go to the Money Zone?

34:08.020 --> 34:09.140
We're already there.

34:09.140 --> 34:09.940
Look around you.

34:20.180 --> 34:21.300
Did you expect that?

34:21.300 --> 34:21.780
I didn't.

34:21.780 --> 34:22.740
You scared me a little bit.

34:22.740 --> 34:24.820
I'm already there.

34:24.820 --> 34:27.780
I constructed around you while you talked.

34:28.580 --> 34:30.900
About my fucking tight awesome ass.

34:32.100 --> 34:35.140
I can't actually right now with any of that.

34:35.700 --> 34:38.580
I want to talk to you folks about Headspace.

34:39.220 --> 34:39.540
Okay.

34:40.740 --> 34:43.940
Headspace is your number one place to build mental websites.

34:44.740 --> 34:44.980
Yeah.

34:47.380 --> 34:48.500
Think it beautiful.

34:48.500 --> 34:49.220
Headspace.

34:49.220 --> 34:52.340
No Headspace is about meditation.

34:52.340 --> 34:54.100
Here's a kind of radical idea.

34:54.740 --> 35:03.540
The only way that you can intake the world around you is filtered through your mind.

35:04.100 --> 35:10.180
So you can't observe or take in any sensation that isn't filtered through your mind first.

35:10.180 --> 35:17.540
If your mind's not right and calm and cool, then it's going to throw literally everything off in

35:17.540 --> 35:23.540
your whole reality, like your whole existence is going to be off kilter because of this.

35:23.540 --> 35:26.660
But I have an answer for you.

35:26.660 --> 35:27.380
It's Headspace.

35:27.380 --> 35:28.820
It's meditation made simple.

35:28.820 --> 35:33.140
Guided meditations that you listen to whenever you want, wherever you want,

35:33.140 --> 35:34.900
right on your phone, computer or tablet.

35:35.940 --> 35:41.060
I've done Headspace a lot of the courses and they're really, really great.

35:41.060 --> 35:46.820
First off, my dude on the meditations has a great voice, Andy.

35:46.820 --> 35:48.020
Believe he is named.

35:48.740 --> 35:53.380
He doesn't, he doesn't like frequently identify himself as Andy and it's time to meditate.

35:53.380 --> 35:54.020
Hey, what's up?

35:54.020 --> 35:55.300
It's your boy Andy here.

35:55.300 --> 35:56.660
Hey, it's your boy Andy.

35:56.660 --> 35:57.780
What's got you stressed?

35:57.780 --> 35:58.580
Fuck that shit.

35:59.300 --> 36:00.660
We're going to get through this together, bro.

36:01.860 --> 36:03.380
Yeah, he is.

36:04.660 --> 36:08.660
Andy is actually a former Buddhist monk with a degree in circus arts.

36:08.660 --> 36:10.420
So he's like the best.

36:10.420 --> 36:11.220
Okay.

36:11.220 --> 36:13.700
Is there an option where I can just kind of hang out with him?

36:13.700 --> 36:18.180
Yeah, it's like hanging out with him except he's speaking directly to you.

36:18.180 --> 36:21.220
It's rooted in thousands of years of tradition with thousands of scientific studies that

36:21.220 --> 36:22.580
show its positive effects.

36:22.580 --> 36:25.700
If you have never tried, and I know Travis is going to back me up on this.

36:25.700 --> 36:29.460
If you have not tried meditation, you have to.

36:29.460 --> 36:33.940
It's like, it's ridiculously easy and ridiculously helpful.

36:33.940 --> 36:38.660
Before I started doing meditation, as I suspect many people do, think of it as like, well,

36:38.660 --> 36:42.340
it's got to be like heavily religious and all about like, oh, you meditate.

36:42.340 --> 36:42.740
No.

36:42.740 --> 36:47.060
Like most of the time, it's just about like, hey, chill out, breathe, like get your mind

36:47.060 --> 36:48.500
right, clear all that shit.

36:48.500 --> 36:49.220
And here's the thing.

36:49.220 --> 36:53.620
You might also be sitting there picturing someone like sitting on a post for like 12

36:53.620 --> 36:54.660
hours like meditate.

36:54.660 --> 37:00.420
No, this is like 10 minute sessions that can really change where you're at and really

37:00.420 --> 37:01.940
help you out without a big commitment.

37:02.580 --> 37:06.260
Speaking of the number 10, you can download the free Headspace app and begin their take

37:06.260 --> 37:12.020
10 program that features 10 days of guided meditation, each about 10 minutes long by

37:12.020 --> 37:14.260
going to headspace.com slash my brother.

37:15.140 --> 37:15.540
Now, I've never-

37:15.540 --> 37:19.380
It's a 100% free way of experiencing the benefits of meditation in your busy modern

37:19.380 --> 37:19.940
life.

37:19.940 --> 37:21.460
I've actually never meditated before.

37:22.180 --> 37:22.980
Seriously?

37:22.980 --> 37:30.500
Yeah, but I do watch the music video for the song Crazy Frog a whole lot.

37:32.580 --> 37:38.500
Like if the woes of the day get to me in my soul and my mind, I'll just put on Crazy

37:38.500 --> 37:39.060
Frog.

37:39.060 --> 37:42.820
Is that what am I trying to say here?

37:42.820 --> 37:45.700
Because this is not just one of my stupid jokes.

37:46.420 --> 37:47.540
I love the Crazy Frog.

37:47.540 --> 37:48.580
I think he's hysterical.

37:48.580 --> 37:52.820
Headspace.com slash my brother is the website to go forget about this.

37:54.420 --> 37:55.140
Ironically.

37:56.500 --> 37:58.180
Up next is Squarespace.

37:59.380 --> 38:02.660
I want you to know I am a big fan of Squarespace.

38:02.660 --> 38:06.180
I built the mcroyshows.com website on Squarespace.

38:06.180 --> 38:11.540
I just built a Squarespace for Interrobang, the new podcast that I do with my friend Tybee.

38:11.540 --> 38:14.260
Tell me about Interrobang, Travis.

38:14.260 --> 38:19.300
Well, Interrobang is a show in which Tybee and I, we address issues that are frustrating

38:19.300 --> 38:22.980
us in the world, that are frustrating other people in the world, and we just kind of talk

38:22.980 --> 38:23.380
through them.

38:23.380 --> 38:29.300
It's like the most open, honest, like most real Travis macro you're gonna get anywhere

38:29.300 --> 38:29.540
else.

38:29.540 --> 38:31.220
Filtered, unfiltered shit.

38:31.220 --> 38:32.740
Unfiltered, emotional.

38:32.740 --> 38:33.940
Do you guys cuss a whole lot?

38:33.940 --> 38:37.940
We cuss, we curse, we use blue language.

38:37.940 --> 38:39.940
We talk about everything.

38:40.820 --> 38:41.860
No holds barred.

38:41.860 --> 38:43.060
Everything's on the table.

38:43.060 --> 38:47.940
And we just launched a Patreon to encourage people to support the show.

38:48.500 --> 38:51.380
And so we needed a website on which to do it.

38:51.380 --> 38:53.700
And like we were kind of freaking out.

38:53.700 --> 38:59.460
I made a really solidly polished, beautiful website on Squarespace in about an hour.

38:59.460 --> 39:03.700
And I'm not, and not just that, I'm also like really proud of the website.

39:03.700 --> 39:05.540
Like I'm really proud to show it off to people.

39:05.540 --> 39:10.500
It's at Interrobangcast.com, took me an hour, and it does everything I need to.

39:10.500 --> 39:15.620
It's got an embedded podcast player, it's got links to all of our contacts, it's got

39:15.620 --> 39:16.580
links to everything.

39:16.580 --> 39:21.220
The MacroShows.com, we can update it in like the blink of an eye.

39:21.220 --> 39:26.660
It's really amazing how much you can do on Squarespace with absolutely no idea what you're

39:26.660 --> 39:27.220
doing.

39:27.220 --> 39:32.100
And not only that, there's so many like tutorials, they've got Squarespace help stuff.

39:32.100 --> 39:34.980
You can tweet at them and get a really quick response.

39:34.980 --> 39:36.260
It's amazing.

39:36.260 --> 39:37.460
I'm a big fan of it.

39:37.460 --> 39:38.340
I highly recommend.

39:38.340 --> 39:43.060
And you can start a free trial today by going to squarespace.com slash my brother.

39:43.060 --> 39:48.660
Dude, I guarantee if you've been thinking of like starting a website, knock it out in

39:48.660 --> 39:50.020
an hour on Squarespace.

39:50.020 --> 39:54.500
Squarespace, you should Squarespace.

39:54.500 --> 39:58.260
Squarespace, bang it out.

40:00.100 --> 40:03.460
I'm going to tell you guys about my favorite podcast about brothers.

40:04.340 --> 40:05.380
Hey, wait a minute.

40:05.380 --> 40:05.940
Hold on.

40:06.500 --> 40:07.540
Wait a second.

40:07.540 --> 40:10.100
I want to tell you about a podcast called A Brother's Quarrel.

40:10.100 --> 40:11.780
Now stop me if you've heard this one before.

40:11.780 --> 40:13.220
It has brothers in it.

40:14.900 --> 40:16.340
And then they talk about stuff.

40:16.900 --> 40:17.380
Cool, cool.

40:19.140 --> 40:20.100
I'm just now reading.

40:20.100 --> 40:21.220
Should we sue?

40:21.220 --> 40:21.860
What's the...

40:21.860 --> 40:23.620
Yeah, yeah, yeah, they're going to jail.

40:23.620 --> 40:27.540
Get this podcast before we get it like legally taken down.

40:27.540 --> 40:31.060
So let's do the advertisement first and get their money.

40:31.060 --> 40:32.740
And like, that's not going to help them.

40:32.740 --> 40:36.260
Like if we get their money, like they can't spend it on expanding their...

40:36.260 --> 40:37.460
Okay, all right, all right.

40:37.460 --> 40:38.180
Break.

40:38.180 --> 40:39.940
I want to tell you guys about A Brother's Quarrel.

40:39.940 --> 40:43.780
It's a podcast about two brothers who try to debate things, but they end up just trailing

40:43.780 --> 40:47.780
off and arguing about, and here's just a list of some argument topics.

40:47.780 --> 40:53.460
Wizard eugenics, stealing Hitler's wallet, or apolitical human skull feng shui.

40:53.460 --> 40:56.340
All of that sounds very good.

40:56.340 --> 41:00.020
I was just running that through the codex of things that we've talked about, and I think

41:00.020 --> 41:02.340
we are clear there.

41:02.340 --> 41:04.420
I don't think there's grounds for a suit there.

41:06.260 --> 41:11.060
Those are pretty specific topics, but A Brother's Quarrel podcast has everything you need.

41:11.060 --> 41:11.460
They got...

41:12.180 --> 41:16.100
Their tagline is two brothers, so there's one less brother than there is here.

41:16.100 --> 41:17.860
That's 33% worse than us.

41:19.060 --> 41:20.020
They only have one mic.

41:20.020 --> 41:24.580
We just have our own mic because we just produce sort of a smell from the face that is bad

41:24.580 --> 41:30.020
to be around, and they have no shame, which that one actually tracks.

41:30.020 --> 41:31.940
That one, they're kind of on the same page.

41:31.940 --> 41:38.180
It's possible that there's two brothers and they're each 50% taller than one of us, so

41:38.180 --> 41:41.140
the two of them together equals three brothers.

41:42.100 --> 41:46.900
It's also possible that there's two brothers and then one guy named Mike, and then it's

41:46.900 --> 41:48.660
just like a kind of a weird name for a podcast.

41:48.660 --> 41:52.580
I would call that two brothers, a mic, and a podcast place.

41:53.220 --> 41:53.620
That's good.

41:53.620 --> 41:55.220
That's just another thing you could have named it.

41:55.220 --> 42:01.140
Anyway, you can find that show, A Brother's Quarrel, on iTunes and also at ABQ Podcast

42:01.140 --> 42:01.780
on Twitter.

42:03.060 --> 42:06.100
I've got a message for Jake, and it's from Grace.

42:06.100 --> 42:07.140
From State Farm?

42:07.140 --> 42:08.980
Do you guys remember that?

42:10.820 --> 42:11.860
Hey, Jake.

42:11.860 --> 42:13.860
It's me, your girlfriend.

42:13.860 --> 42:15.780
It's been five years of good times.

42:15.780 --> 42:19.140
Thanks for being cute and sweet and funny.

42:19.140 --> 42:20.820
You rock that MeUndies hat.

42:21.700 --> 42:22.580
All right, see ya.

42:24.340 --> 42:25.140
That was from-

42:25.140 --> 42:25.620
Nice.

42:25.620 --> 42:29.220
That was from Jake's girlfriend, Grace, which I wanted to state again here because I made

42:29.220 --> 42:34.340
that terrible dumb Jake from State Farm joke, and I feel like I buried Grace's name.

42:35.700 --> 42:40.980
Do you guys think that you rock that MeUndies hat is like coded language for Grace wanting

42:40.980 --> 42:45.060
to compliment how Jake actually looks in MeUndies and just didn't want to embarrass him on the

42:45.060 --> 42:46.100
podcast or something?

42:46.100 --> 42:49.460
Your downtown situation looks good under all that MeUndies fabric.

42:50.580 --> 42:52.740
I feel like, well, it doesn't say where he's wearing it.

42:53.780 --> 42:55.460
That's a fantastic point.

42:56.260 --> 42:56.580
Oh.

42:57.220 --> 42:58.340
Like maybe it's on his dick.

42:59.060 --> 42:59.300
Oh.

43:01.300 --> 43:02.660
Did you guys see that coming?

43:02.660 --> 43:05.700
I thought you meant like he was balancing it on his tummy.

43:05.700 --> 43:08.020
Or he was sweating it on his finger like a cool kid.

43:08.580 --> 43:13.220
Or maybe it's passive aggressive like, hey, I really, really, really like it.

43:13.220 --> 43:16.340
I like how you wore that MeUndies hat to my grandmother's funeral.

43:17.940 --> 43:20.100
That was so tasteful and appropriate.

43:20.100 --> 43:20.580
All right.

43:20.580 --> 43:20.980
See ya.

43:22.580 --> 43:25.700
That's the best way to end every romantic message.

43:25.700 --> 43:27.300
Hey, I think you're great.

43:27.300 --> 43:29.300
I really, I'm really glad you're in my life.

43:29.940 --> 43:30.420
All right.

43:30.420 --> 43:30.740
See ya.

43:32.260 --> 43:32.900
Peace.

43:32.900 --> 43:34.020
Grace out.

43:34.020 --> 43:35.460
Sorry about your GMOS.

43:35.460 --> 43:36.660
Sucks, dude.

43:36.660 --> 43:37.140
Later.

43:40.420 --> 43:41.460
Welcome to Oh No!

43:41.460 --> 43:42.260
Ross and Carrie.

43:42.260 --> 43:42.740
Ross.

43:42.740 --> 43:43.300
Hi, Carrie.

43:43.300 --> 43:44.980
What do you think is creepier?

43:44.980 --> 43:45.460
Okay.

43:45.460 --> 43:48.100
You jump into a swimming pool.

43:48.100 --> 43:51.380
All of a sudden, the water goes away and instead of water,

43:51.380 --> 43:54.340
there is the bones of your dead ancestors.

43:54.340 --> 43:54.900
Ew.

43:54.900 --> 43:56.500
Or our show.

43:56.500 --> 44:00.020
That's pretty tough because we visited a live exorcism.

44:00.020 --> 44:03.780
We joined the Ordo Templi Orientis where we had to worship a naked lady.

44:03.780 --> 44:05.620
Oh, and we joined that Tony Olomo cult.

44:05.620 --> 44:06.580
They were scary.

44:06.580 --> 44:07.300
Super creepy.

44:07.300 --> 44:08.820
We joined the Ethere Society.

44:08.820 --> 44:11.140
We tried penis enlargement, or at least I did.

44:11.140 --> 44:12.660
Boy, I tried breast enlargement.

44:12.660 --> 44:18.580
We have basically done every creepy, weird, fringe thing except for thousands more,

44:18.580 --> 44:20.420
which we will get to if you listen to our show.

44:20.420 --> 44:23.140
I'd still say the swimming pool of my ancestors' bones.

44:23.140 --> 44:24.820
Well, then I don't even know if people should listen.

44:24.820 --> 44:25.700
I guess they shouldn't.

44:25.700 --> 44:29.220
But if you want to, we're at Maximum Fun and this show is called Oh No!

44:29.220 --> 44:30.100
Ross and Carrie.

44:33.380 --> 44:38.100
I recently celebrated a birthday and received a check from my grandparents who live in Delaware.

44:38.100 --> 44:44.180
While in my wallet, my check lost a corner and now it's compromised.

44:44.180 --> 44:44.820
What to do?

44:45.460 --> 44:52.180
Chalk it up to a $100 loss or call my G parents that I talk to maybe once a year?

44:52.900 --> 44:55.620
Damn, you get $100 for talking once a year?

44:57.300 --> 44:58.260
Wait, wait, wait.

44:58.260 --> 44:59.460
Are you 100 years old?

45:00.580 --> 45:02.420
Because that's the only way this makes sense to me.

45:03.380 --> 45:06.580
I'm leaning towards sending it back with a thank you card with an explanation so that

45:06.580 --> 45:07.860
they may avoid it.

45:07.860 --> 45:09.460
As well as put the ball in their court.

45:10.020 --> 45:10.980
Thoughts?

45:10.980 --> 45:13.380
You got some consequences of cutting quarters in Charleston?

45:15.620 --> 45:16.580
That's actually way-

45:16.580 --> 45:19.380
Your thing is way better than anything we could come up with.

45:21.300 --> 45:22.740
Of sending it back to them like,

45:22.740 --> 45:24.100
well, it looks like you goofed up.

45:24.100 --> 45:24.580
Anyway.

45:28.180 --> 45:28.660
Anyway.

45:32.260 --> 45:33.540
Pay for this to get a waste.

45:33.540 --> 45:34.340
Anyway.

45:34.340 --> 45:36.340
Yikes, yikes, yikes, yikes.

45:36.340 --> 45:38.660
Oops, oops, oops.

45:38.660 --> 45:40.820
Pretty uncomfortable, yikes.

45:41.780 --> 45:44.660
And also be meters running on interest.

45:45.220 --> 45:45.720
So.

45:55.380 --> 45:56.820
Make sure you avoid it.

45:56.820 --> 46:02.100
And my address is still the same.

46:02.100 --> 46:05.780
I still have the same old address.

46:08.420 --> 46:12.340
Thanks so much for this hypothetical money in the future.

46:12.340 --> 46:12.840
Great.

46:13.780 --> 46:16.980
Looking forward to your correspondence.

46:18.580 --> 46:21.620
Wait, I have a great idea.

46:22.900 --> 46:25.220
Same thing, sort of.

46:25.220 --> 46:28.020
But in the thank you note, just write,

46:29.540 --> 46:31.540
this gift means so much to me.

46:31.540 --> 46:33.460
Do you think before I cash it,

46:33.460 --> 46:36.580
you all could take a picture of yourselves holding it

46:36.580 --> 46:40.100
with kind of like a thumbs up so I can remember it forever?

46:40.100 --> 46:41.620
Because the bank will keep it.

46:41.620 --> 46:42.740
Could you take it and do that?

46:42.740 --> 46:44.900
And then when it's missing a quarter,

46:44.900 --> 46:46.420
they tell you just like, what?

46:47.620 --> 46:49.540
The post office did it again.

46:49.540 --> 46:52.180
Well, I guess avoid that and write a new one.

46:52.180 --> 46:54.660
What if they just mail you back the same check

46:54.660 --> 46:58.740
and they're like, well, here's the check.

46:58.740 --> 47:00.740
Check.

47:00.740 --> 47:03.700
Maybe you missed how this processor works.

47:05.220 --> 47:06.260
Wait, no, wait.

47:06.260 --> 47:09.940
Mine's perfect and could still work if it's a video.

47:10.820 --> 47:12.420
If it's a video instead.

47:12.420 --> 47:16.100
And they say, hey, listen, Dylan is cool.

47:16.660 --> 47:19.540
This is Dylan's g-pa and g-ba coming at you.

47:19.540 --> 47:22.660
And you're saying if you take that video to the bank?

47:24.820 --> 47:28.420
I see you furrowing your brow at that missing corner

47:28.420 --> 47:30.820
before you say anything, check the iPhone.

47:32.420 --> 47:34.260
Wait, hold on, let me get my email app.

47:34.260 --> 47:34.980
Give me a second.

47:35.940 --> 47:38.180
Sir, we can't accept this check.

47:38.180 --> 47:40.180
The corner of it's gone and the check's been compromised.

47:40.180 --> 47:43.060
Before, okay, now wait, before you poo poo me

47:43.060 --> 47:44.900
and you rain on my whole parade,

47:44.900 --> 47:48.020
I'd like to show you this video of any old man

47:48.020 --> 47:50.580
that I have on my phone.

47:50.580 --> 47:52.500
Note the similar nose shapes.

47:53.380 --> 47:53.780
Interesting.

47:53.780 --> 47:55.460
You could do it live with Skype

47:55.460 --> 47:57.460
and that way you could also include,

47:57.460 --> 47:59.860
they'll be so tired of you trying to help

47:59.860 --> 48:02.420
your grandpa troubleshoot Skype

48:02.420 --> 48:04.260
there on the lobby of the bank

48:04.260 --> 48:05.940
that they'll probably just cash for you anyway.

48:06.900 --> 48:09.700
How compromised is the corner of this check?

48:10.900 --> 48:13.060
How much would you have to lose off a check

48:13.060 --> 48:14.340
before a bank wouldn't take it anymore?

48:14.340 --> 48:17.220
Okay, so it would have to be the bottom left.

48:17.220 --> 48:18.900
Like lose those numbers down there.

48:18.900 --> 48:21.620
So then how did that happen in your wallet?

48:21.620 --> 48:22.900
It's got jelly in there.

48:22.900 --> 48:23.460
Oh no.

48:25.540 --> 48:27.300
Silverfish in his wallet.

48:27.300 --> 48:30.740
I am kind of in an uncomfortable place

48:30.740 --> 48:34.340
of thinking about how many times I did this

48:35.460 --> 48:38.580
when I was younger and I hated the bank.

48:38.580 --> 48:41.540
Like I got nervous to do anything involving

48:41.540 --> 48:48.660
any sort of building where government happened.

48:49.620 --> 48:50.900
And that was like, I was so,

48:50.900 --> 48:53.220
like that's how little I knew about the whole situation

48:53.220 --> 48:55.460
is that I thought the bank was government

48:55.460 --> 48:56.580
and hey man, look around.

48:56.580 --> 48:57.860
Pretty much man, yeah.

48:57.860 --> 49:01.060
How old were you when you were going to the bank, Griffin?

49:01.060 --> 49:03.060
I mean, I was like 18, 19 years old

49:03.060 --> 49:05.140
and I would get like a check and I didn't have any money

49:05.140 --> 49:07.300
because I was in college and I had none of the money.

49:07.860 --> 49:13.300
And I would get like a $20 check from a grandparent

49:13.300 --> 49:15.780
and I wouldn't like immediately rush to cash it

49:15.780 --> 49:16.340
because it's $20.

49:16.980 --> 49:19.220
But then when I had like negative dollars,

49:19.220 --> 49:21.140
I would be like, I could use that Twonsky

49:21.140 --> 49:22.900
but it's been like two months.

49:23.460 --> 49:24.260
Is that still cool?

49:24.260 --> 49:26.660
The health potion that you had sat on for a while

49:26.660 --> 49:28.980
and now you can like pop the cork on it.

49:28.980 --> 49:31.700
Yes, except it had been months

49:31.700 --> 49:34.420
and then my grandma would look at her bank account

49:34.420 --> 49:36.340
and be like, oh, where'd that health potion go?

49:38.500 --> 49:41.620
And then she would think that like somebody is like

49:42.580 --> 49:43.700
fucking robbing the blind.

49:43.700 --> 49:47.620
Somebody has hacked into her bank account

49:47.620 --> 49:48.900
and is robbing her.

49:48.900 --> 49:52.100
That check I wrote for therapeutic socks last week bounced.

49:52.100 --> 49:54.900
Huh, that's weird how that happened.

49:54.900 --> 49:59.220
Well, I needed those to keep my feet, but hmm.

49:59.220 --> 50:00.100
Thank you, Skylar.

50:00.100 --> 50:01.940
I'll just live with the gout, I guess.

50:01.940 --> 50:02.740
Thank you so much.

50:03.540 --> 50:06.820
I hope you enjoyed that $20 you probably spent

50:06.820 --> 50:08.580
on Doritos and spliffs.

50:12.020 --> 50:13.860
Spliffs, you know, weed spliffs.

50:13.860 --> 50:15.140
Yeah, spliffs.

50:15.140 --> 50:17.220
I just went super hard at the gym

50:17.220 --> 50:20.420
but I forgot to change a shirt since the one I worked out

50:20.420 --> 50:22.820
and this is soaked in my glory sweat.

50:22.820 --> 50:25.940
I'm walking out with my jacket on but nothing underneath.

50:25.940 --> 50:28.660
If I still wanna go out, grab a beer and shoot pool,

50:28.660 --> 50:30.020
am I good?

50:30.020 --> 50:32.500
That's from Commando up top in the Commonwealth

50:33.540 --> 50:36.820
and aside from turning yourself into a mini boss

50:36.820 --> 50:40.660
in a brawling video game, I think that you're fun.

50:41.540 --> 50:45.540
In a fucking 8-bit voice, hey man, this is our turf.

50:47.860 --> 50:49.860
Duck off, pimp squig.

50:49.860 --> 50:51.380
She is my girl now.

50:52.020 --> 50:55.700
You'll never rescue the president's daughter from Viper.

51:00.580 --> 51:02.260
Taste my steel.

51:03.540 --> 51:06.740
Only now do I realize I wasted my potential.

51:09.540 --> 51:10.900
I could have been a teacher.

51:11.460 --> 51:12.740
Batter up.

51:12.740 --> 51:14.100
And then he hits it with a pool cue.

51:14.100 --> 51:15.220
Yeah, well, hold on.

51:15.220 --> 51:19.460
I dropped out of nursing school.

51:19.460 --> 51:23.140
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

51:23.140 --> 51:26.420
I kidnap women because I don't love myself.

51:26.420 --> 51:28.180
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

51:30.100 --> 51:33.300
This is, I'm gonna go and give this one a hard pass.

51:34.980 --> 51:35.780
Really?

51:35.780 --> 51:36.580
Not that I'm passing on a question.

51:36.580 --> 51:38.900
You're so permissive about literally everything.

51:38.900 --> 51:40.900
I'm just passing on the situation.

51:41.540 --> 51:42.420
You know what I mean?

51:42.420 --> 51:47.460
Like if I saw this person out at the local pool shooting hall

51:47.460 --> 51:50.980
and they rolled up like, hey, would you like to play a game?

51:50.980 --> 51:53.140
I just kidnapped the president's daughter.

51:53.140 --> 51:57.860
I would look at them and I would see just their chest and tummy underneath of,

51:57.860 --> 52:00.980
I'm imagining a suit jacket.

52:00.980 --> 52:02.260
That's probably not right, is it?

52:02.980 --> 52:05.780
Yeah, since it's a jacket that zips all the way up.

52:07.460 --> 52:08.900
Some suit jackets do that.

52:08.900 --> 52:12.020
Yeah, okay, cool.

52:12.820 --> 52:13.540
Sorry, what?

52:14.420 --> 52:15.860
Like a zip up suit jacket.

52:16.820 --> 52:22.660
The sensation that this person is describing of wearing a zip up jacket with no shirt,

52:22.660 --> 52:27.540
I only have an association with like, I forgot that it's garbage day.

52:27.540 --> 52:29.780
Yeah, you know what I mean?

52:29.780 --> 52:30.980
That's the look.

52:30.980 --> 52:32.180
I think that, here's the thing.

52:32.180 --> 52:35.140
I have no problem with this person finishing their workout,

52:35.140 --> 52:37.860
throwing just a jacket on and going home

52:37.860 --> 52:42.500
because that's like a stopgap, like I had to, I couldn't just drive home.

52:42.500 --> 52:45.380
Well, yeah, Travie, what's the fucking, what's the fucking alternative?

52:45.380 --> 52:47.700
Oh no, I live at the gym now, dang.

52:47.700 --> 52:50.420
Well, you can wear your sweaty, gross shirt home.

52:51.460 --> 52:53.620
But like, I don't think you have to do that, I think you,

52:53.620 --> 52:56.020
but like, as soon as you're like, and also I'm gonna stop

52:56.020 --> 52:59.460
and run some errands and maybe kick back and really relax.

52:59.460 --> 53:01.780
Go home, get a t-shirt and then go to the pool hall.

53:03.380 --> 53:07.300
It kind of depends on what kind of a workout you had.

53:07.300 --> 53:10.820
Right, because if you just did some light cardio

53:11.460 --> 53:13.460
and you just did like a little bit of something,

53:13.460 --> 53:16.500
something to get that blood pumping, that heart rate up,

53:16.500 --> 53:19.780
and then you go home and you have a light sweat situation

53:19.780 --> 53:22.500
and a little bit of stink, I think you could disguise that.

53:22.500 --> 53:24.740
If you were on some dole vet shit,

53:25.620 --> 53:30.180
if you were, you know, doing full cardio and strength resistance training,

53:30.180 --> 53:32.980
fucking medicine balls, fucking yoga balls,

53:32.980 --> 53:39.300
a fucking racquetball, spinning, and yoga laddies,

53:39.300 --> 53:41.380
and you were on that dole vet shit,

53:41.380 --> 53:45.380
and you have the visible stink waves coming off you,

53:45.380 --> 53:47.620
you'd gotta go home and wash your body off.

53:48.260 --> 53:51.620
But you don't have the stink waves of I sat around for four days,

53:51.620 --> 53:55.540
you have the stink wave of I worked hard to get this beautiful.

53:55.540 --> 53:57.620
Doesn't matter, Travis, that's a sour scent,

53:57.620 --> 54:01.060
and I don't wanna be around it when I'm trying to shoot my billiards.

54:01.060 --> 54:02.100
Travis.

54:02.100 --> 54:02.980
That's fair, Griffin.

54:02.980 --> 54:04.900
I didn't mean to infringe on your billiards time.

54:04.900 --> 54:07.220
If they're playing billiards and every time they lean over

54:07.220 --> 54:11.380
and the hoodie is no longer clinging to their sticky, stinky body,

54:11.380 --> 54:15.460
and just like a little bit of that slimer ghost comes out, no!

54:15.460 --> 54:16.980
Oh, oh, wait, hold on.

54:16.980 --> 54:17.540
Unless.

54:18.340 --> 54:18.820
Unless.

54:18.820 --> 54:19.540
Unless.

54:19.540 --> 54:23.700
You use the jacket as like a hustle maneuver.

54:24.260 --> 54:27.060
Like someone comes over to play you and then you're like,

54:27.060 --> 54:29.940
okay, well, let me just unzip my jacket.

54:29.940 --> 54:33.380
And now just your bare chest is hanging out

54:33.380 --> 54:36.500
as a brilliant distraction against your opponent.

54:36.500 --> 54:40.100
You are going to need to time this out

54:40.100 --> 54:43.780
with the money you put in the jukebox, adjust right.

54:46.740 --> 54:47.940
Oh, yeah, I guess I can play.

54:47.940 --> 54:50.740
Hold on, just wait like one more song.

54:50.740 --> 54:51.700
And then you wait one more song.

54:51.700 --> 54:52.820
Okay, I'm free now, I'm free now.

54:52.820 --> 54:53.940
I'm free now, come on, let's play.

54:53.940 --> 54:55.140
Rack them quick, rack them quick.

54:55.140 --> 54:56.500
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

54:56.500 --> 55:04.500
And Panama, zip!

55:04.500 --> 55:05.540
You got to time it right though.

55:05.540 --> 55:07.140
You got to make sure that your song's next

55:07.140 --> 55:10.340
because the last thing you want to do is like rack them, zip!

55:10.340 --> 55:13.220
Where were you when the world stopped turning?

55:14.100 --> 55:15.540
That's September day.

55:15.540 --> 55:16.900
Hold on, let me zip this back up.

55:16.900 --> 55:18.260
Don't look, don't look, don't look.

55:18.260 --> 55:18.900
You didn't see that.

55:18.900 --> 55:20.100
Unrack them, unrack them.

55:20.100 --> 55:21.540
That's the method of moving around.

55:21.540 --> 55:22.580
Put them back, put them back.

55:22.580 --> 55:24.580
Here it comes, here it comes, here it comes, here it comes, here it comes.

55:24.580 --> 55:26.980
Here it comes, yeah, baby, here it comes, here it comes, zip!

55:26.980 --> 55:28.980
I've seen fire and I've seen rain.

55:28.980 --> 55:30.180
Fuck, come on!

55:31.060 --> 55:32.580
Why is this even in the jukebox?

55:33.300 --> 55:35.380
The country version of James Taylor.

55:35.940 --> 55:37.940
I've seen fire and I've seen rain.

55:39.620 --> 55:41.060
Hold on, no, wait.

55:41.060 --> 55:44.020
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, zip!

55:44.020 --> 55:47.620
Mary, did you know that your baby boy-

55:47.620 --> 55:48.980
This is a Christmas song.

55:48.980 --> 55:52.660
Is this a Christmas song?

55:52.660 --> 55:53.860
Actually, this one's fine.

55:53.860 --> 55:54.660
Actually, this one's fine.

55:54.660 --> 55:55.300
Let's just do this.

55:55.300 --> 55:57.140
If that plays, just do it slower.

55:57.140 --> 55:59.860
And then it's like, well, guys, let's, come on.

55:59.860 --> 56:00.980
Where are we going?

56:00.980 --> 56:02.980
This has been my brother, my brother, and me

56:02.980 --> 56:04.740
in an advice show for the modern era,

56:04.740 --> 56:08.740
closing the book on volume one.

56:08.740 --> 56:13.940
What changes are in store for volume two, episode 300?

56:13.940 --> 56:15.140
We may never know.

56:15.140 --> 56:17.540
Do we get to take a break after 300?

56:17.540 --> 56:19.220
Do we get to like skip a fucking-

56:19.220 --> 56:20.980
Like, have we not earned it?

56:21.940 --> 56:23.060
How can we serve it?

56:23.060 --> 56:26.260
Like, you can't really appreciate, you know?

56:26.260 --> 56:29.060
Yeah, can't really appreciate how much-

56:29.060 --> 56:30.100
Yeah.

56:30.100 --> 56:30.900
You know what I mean?

56:30.900 --> 56:33.460
We're like neck deep in the fucking content mill.

56:34.180 --> 56:36.100
It's hard for us to like take a step back

56:36.100 --> 56:39.060
and really peruse volume one, figure out what works,

56:39.060 --> 56:40.260
what didn't work.

56:40.260 --> 56:43.140
We should take like one, maybe two years off.

56:44.180 --> 56:44.820
I like this.

56:44.820 --> 56:48.500
Just like, yeah, maybe like one or two years off.

56:49.540 --> 56:51.540
Okay, everybody else, not Justin and Griffin.

56:51.540 --> 56:52.900
Justin and Griffin, you stay there!

56:52.900 --> 56:56.020
I'm gonna keep doing the show for that one to two years,

56:56.020 --> 56:57.460
but it'll just be me.

56:57.460 --> 56:58.820
The show will just be called me.

56:59.380 --> 57:02.980
And then we're gonna add the brothers back in slowly over time

57:02.980 --> 57:04.420
and it'll be my brother and me.

57:04.420 --> 57:06.100
And then we'll add in one more.

57:06.100 --> 57:06.660
And then we'll just keep adding-

57:06.660 --> 57:08.660
Goo Punch!

57:08.660 --> 57:10.100
Hey ladies!

57:10.100 --> 57:11.460
Do you guys know the show, My Brother and Me?

57:14.660 --> 57:16.420
Do you guys remember the Nickelodeon show, My Brother and Me?

57:16.420 --> 57:18.740
There's a great episode they did about Goo Punch.

57:18.740 --> 57:24.100
I think Goo, who was a character on that show named Goo,

57:24.100 --> 57:26.740
had like a soft drink that he was peddling.

57:27.620 --> 57:29.380
And I also remember the little boy liked to say,

57:29.380 --> 57:30.820
hanging with the big kids.

57:30.820 --> 57:32.020
And that's like me now.

57:32.020 --> 57:33.620
Like this podcast has given me an avenue

57:33.620 --> 57:35.620
to hang with the big kids and I'm very excited about that.

57:36.340 --> 57:38.420
Are we the big kids or the listeners the big kids?

57:38.420 --> 57:39.780
Good question.

57:39.780 --> 57:42.500
Yeah, I wanna thank John Roderick of the Long Winters

57:42.500 --> 57:43.300
for the use of our theme song.

57:43.300 --> 57:45.540
It's a departure off the album, putting the days to bed.

57:45.540 --> 57:47.460
It's a shame we're gonna have to change it for volume two.

57:47.460 --> 57:49.940
It served us well over the episodes,

57:49.940 --> 57:51.060
but no, I'm just kidding.

57:51.060 --> 57:53.060
It's, we got that shit for life.

57:53.060 --> 57:55.780
I would like to encourage everyone to go check out

57:55.780 --> 57:56.900
McElroyShows.com.

57:56.900 --> 57:57.860
I mentioned it earlier.

57:57.860 --> 58:01.060
It has all the McElroy podcasts and video projects

58:01.060 --> 58:04.980
and all that stuff, along with like the P.O. Box addresses,

58:05.540 --> 58:07.620
all the Twitter accounts, all the Facebook groups,

58:07.620 --> 58:08.260
that kind of stuff.

58:08.900 --> 58:11.940
And I just wanna remind everyone to go check out Interrobang.

58:11.940 --> 58:14.900
You can find it Interrobangcast.com.

58:14.900 --> 58:16.020
Check out the Patreon

58:16.020 --> 58:18.100
and maybe consider becoming a supporter.

58:18.100 --> 58:19.620
It would mean the world to me.

58:19.620 --> 58:21.300
But if something else, just check out the show.

58:22.100 --> 58:24.020
That is not a Max Fun product, right?

58:24.020 --> 58:24.980
You're not double dipping.

58:24.980 --> 58:25.700
That is correct.

58:25.700 --> 58:29.460
This is a brand new show that me and my friend Tybee

58:29.460 --> 58:32.180
have started unaffiliated with any network.

58:32.980 --> 58:34.340
We do it because we love it

58:34.340 --> 58:36.340
and because we hope that you'll love it.

58:36.340 --> 58:39.380
So even if you aren't interested in becoming a patron,

58:39.380 --> 58:40.820
I totally understand that.

58:40.820 --> 58:42.180
But maybe give the show a listen.

58:42.180 --> 58:43.140
It's on iTunes.

58:43.140 --> 58:46.180
You can find it on Pocket Cast and on macroshows.com.

58:46.180 --> 58:47.460
And if you just hate it,

58:48.020 --> 58:49.540
then there's a bunch of other shows for you to listen to

58:49.540 --> 58:50.900
on maximumfun.org.

58:50.900 --> 58:53.620
Talking about shows like Stop Podcasting Yourself.

58:53.620 --> 58:54.500
I said that weird.

58:55.060 --> 58:55.380
Yeah.

58:55.380 --> 58:57.140
Stop Podcasting Yourself.

58:57.140 --> 58:58.900
I'm talking about shows like Bull's Eye.

58:58.900 --> 59:01.060
Talking about shows like Lady Two Lady.

59:01.060 --> 59:02.900
Talking about shows like Getting Curious.

59:03.620 --> 59:04.740
We do other shows on the network

59:04.740 --> 59:06.980
like The Adventure Zone, Sawbones, and Schmaners.

59:06.980 --> 59:07.780
A lot of great-

59:09.060 --> 59:11.540
Oh no, Ross and Carrie.

59:11.540 --> 59:13.540
Oh no.

59:13.540 --> 59:15.220
See, that's one worthy inflection to really-

59:15.220 --> 59:16.020
It's fun, yeah.

59:16.020 --> 59:18.580
What about one bad mother?

59:18.580 --> 59:19.780
A lot of great shows.

59:19.780 --> 59:20.660
Maximumfun.org.

59:20.660 --> 59:21.140
Check it out.

59:22.020 --> 59:23.940

59:29.860 --> 59:33.860
I'm right now wearing my Rocket Crocodile Flophouse T-shirt.

59:34.820 --> 59:35.700
It's super cool.

59:35.700 --> 59:36.820
Fuck, I gotta get that.

59:36.820 --> 59:37.860
Oh, it's so good.

59:37.860 --> 59:39.460
And there's a really cool Sawbones T-shirt

59:39.460 --> 59:40.900
that Teresa likes to rock

59:40.900 --> 59:42.340
that I highly recommend for everyone.

59:42.340 --> 59:43.220
So go check that out.

59:43.940 --> 59:45.620
And we haven't mentioned in a while,

59:45.620 --> 59:47.700
if you're looking for where to submit questions

59:47.700 --> 59:48.900
and Yahoo Answers stuff,

59:49.540 --> 59:52.900
mbmbam at maximumfun.org.

59:53.540 --> 59:54.100
All right.

59:54.100 --> 59:55.220
Finally, Yahoo.

59:55.220 --> 59:56.580
It was sent in by level9000.

59:56.580 --> 59:57.620
Yeah, Drew, Drew, Drew Devonport.

59:57.620 --> 59:58.420
Thank you, Drew.

59:58.420 --> 01:00:00.100
It's by Yahoo Answers user,

01:00:00.100 --> 01:00:01.940
Let's Kill Hitler, who asks,

01:00:03.940 --> 01:00:06.420
if celebrities were Pokemon,

01:00:06.420 --> 01:00:10.660
who would you use your master ball for?

01:00:10.660 --> 01:00:16.260
Oh, my name is Justin McElroy.

01:00:16.260 --> 01:00:17.380

01:00:17.380 --> 01:00:19.060
I'm Travis McElroy, Rob Lowe.

01:00:20.580 --> 01:00:21.940
See, I can't say Carly Rae Jepsen

01:00:21.940 --> 01:00:23.220
because then it sounds like I want to put her

01:00:23.220 --> 01:00:25.060
in like a weird cage.

01:00:25.060 --> 01:00:26.100
Too late now.

01:00:26.100 --> 01:00:26.580
It's out there.

01:00:26.580 --> 01:00:27.460

01:00:57.540 --> 01:00:58.180
Let's be honest.

01:00:58.180 --> 01:00:59.540
We live in a world with too much media.

01:00:59.540 --> 01:01:01.540
You need a podcast on the front lines,

01:01:01.540 --> 01:01:03.060
figuring out what's great.

01:01:03.060 --> 01:01:04.020
