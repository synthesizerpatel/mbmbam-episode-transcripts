00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:31.840
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:31.840 --> 00:47.760
Hello everybody and welcome to My Brother, My Brother and Me, an advice show for the modern

00:47.760 --> 00:51.440
era. I'm the oldest brother, Justin McElroy. They call me around these parts.

00:51.440 --> 00:56.640
I'm the middle-est brother, Travis McElroy. I am the youngest brother, Griffin McElroy.

00:56.640 --> 01:02.000
I'm, uh, I would like to welcome everybody, all of our listeners. This is rare, we don't normally

01:02.000 --> 01:06.000
open these doors up, but welcome to the My Brother, My Brother and Me writers room.

01:06.880 --> 01:11.120
Yeah, sort of a bit of a panic. So if you can envision like a bunch of papers like flying

01:11.120 --> 01:15.840
through the air and some like spilled coffee and there's like our interns in the corner like,

01:15.840 --> 01:20.240
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know. And like we started writing on the white board,

01:20.240 --> 01:23.520
but we just ran out of room there so we just started writing on the walls.

01:23.520 --> 01:30.080
Yeah, and there's a doomsday clock sort of counting down and I show up, I'm wearing like a,

01:30.080 --> 01:33.200
you know, I got like the Steve Martin arrow through my head like, is this anything,

01:33.200 --> 01:37.840
is this anything? And, um, man, we're in, we're in, we're in the shit.

01:38.960 --> 01:45.840
I'm just gonna come out and say it, folks. We don't know what to do about 420. I mean,

01:45.840 --> 01:47.040
there it is, right? Yeah.

01:48.080 --> 01:51.680
We don't know what to do. And we fell into this weird kind of valley

01:51.680 --> 01:55.440
where it was both like for a long time it felt too far away to plan anything,

01:55.440 --> 02:00.240
and now it feels too close to do anything right. And I don't know where the window was,

02:00.240 --> 02:05.360
I feel like I missed it completely. Like maybe it was like during the week where we had to put

02:05.360 --> 02:09.120
up like one of the live episodes or something, and that was the week we could have planned.

02:09.120 --> 02:16.720
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. We just don't got it, because we could do a bunch of weed jokes,

02:16.720 --> 02:22.880
that would be bad, because we haven't enjoyed the kind herb for many, many moons.

02:24.320 --> 02:30.080
And, I mean, could episode one of the Trolls 2 podcast that we do technically be episode

02:30.080 --> 02:34.560
420 of Mabimbo? Because I think that was probably all of our last brush with the kindness.

02:34.560 --> 02:37.120
Like we could re-air, re-air the broadcast?

02:37.120 --> 02:42.480
Yeah, sure, but probably people wouldn't like that. I had an idea where we could do a recap of

02:42.480 --> 02:47.200
like our favorite Family Guy episodes, but I don't think that that's got the legs to get us

02:47.200 --> 02:51.040
all the way. Yeah, because like how do you fucking choose? That's my number one thing.

02:51.680 --> 02:57.760
And the other thing is just like, it is still a criminal crime in a lot of places,

02:57.760 --> 03:01.040
and so wrestling with that is something, because I don't want to make a joke about

03:01.840 --> 03:03.680
something that could get me put in the slammer.

03:04.560 --> 03:07.840
What do you guys think about we all do it on Mescaline?

03:07.840 --> 03:12.320
Interesting. What if we do 420 on Mescaline?

03:12.320 --> 03:12.880
That could be something.

03:12.880 --> 03:16.080
Here's my thing about Mescaline. I don't know what that is.

03:16.720 --> 03:19.920
Okay, I always picture Jell-O. Is it Jell-O?

03:19.920 --> 03:21.200
That's a good point. It could be Jell-O.

03:21.200 --> 03:23.120
I don't actually know what Mescaline is.

03:23.120 --> 03:28.960
I have a kind of out there idea, and it might be good enough that we could actually do it.

03:28.960 --> 03:30.240
And you guys let me know what you think.

03:31.280 --> 03:36.160
Next week, next Monday, people hop out of bed. They load up their podcast app.

03:36.160 --> 03:40.000
They wait five or six hours, because there ain't no way I'm gonna get one of these bad boys up

03:40.000 --> 03:46.320
before noon. And then the episode does come up, and they see episode 421. We skip it.

03:47.040 --> 03:47.920
Yes, we skip it.

03:47.920 --> 03:53.280
I actually love that we skip it until we're ready to pull a perfect one.

03:53.280 --> 03:55.360
Oh, I love that.

03:55.360 --> 04:02.560
And then that'll be great, because we'll be in episode 539, and next week comes out is episode

04:02.560 --> 04:07.600
420. How exciting is that gonna be for everybody when we come back and we're like,

04:07.600 --> 04:10.640
oh, wow, they finally fucking cracked it. That's so good.

04:10.640 --> 04:13.440
That's an amazing idea. I love that very much.

04:13.440 --> 04:18.480
There's a show that's already gone here before that has crossed this

04:19.440 --> 04:27.280
treacherous ravine, and it's Family Guy, which had a 420th episode.

04:27.280 --> 04:28.160
Oh, good, but they do.

04:28.160 --> 04:32.800
Yeah. Nope, never mind. It was just an episode called 420. They haven't done this.

04:32.800 --> 04:35.040
Oh, shit. I bet that was a good one, though. Fuck.

04:35.040 --> 04:40.080
I bet it was a good one. It aired on April 20th, so it was not the 420th episode.

04:40.080 --> 04:49.680
Oh, man. Did ol' Quag smooch any bebs? Did my boy Quagmire smooch any bebs?

04:50.480 --> 04:52.640
I don't know if he smooched any bebs.

04:53.360 --> 04:56.000
I had a dream in which I had beef with Seth McFarlane,

04:56.000 --> 04:58.160
and he dumped some Hannah sanitizer on me.

05:00.560 --> 05:02.560
I had a dream where I had beef with Seth McFarlane,

05:02.560 --> 05:07.520
and he dropped some Hannah tattoos on my hands when I was asleep.

05:07.520 --> 05:08.020
What?

05:09.600 --> 05:13.360
All right, so the next episode that you hear is going to be episode 421, unless-

05:14.160 --> 05:15.040
Unless?

05:15.040 --> 05:17.040
Unless we find it.

05:17.040 --> 05:18.480
We do crack it in the next week.

05:21.680 --> 05:25.520
We will remove it from its place unstuck in time, and we'll just knock that shit out.

05:25.520 --> 05:30.080
But I find it very, very unlikely that's going to happen. So 421's the next one.

05:30.080 --> 05:31.920
Oh, boy. I'm glad we could settle this.

05:31.920 --> 05:37.680
And listen, don't tweet us your great ideas about what we should do for 420,

05:37.680 --> 05:42.560
because then everybody will see them. You got to email them to us, and then we'll do them.

05:42.560 --> 05:44.560
That way we can do it without crediting you.

05:45.120 --> 05:49.920
Yeah, it will be the ideal scenario. And make sure you say at the top of the email,

05:49.920 --> 05:54.480
legally, property of McElroy Brothers. If you send us an email, we own it, basically.

05:54.480 --> 05:55.200
Yeah.

05:55.200 --> 05:58.960
If you send us your social security number, you are basically like,

05:59.840 --> 06:01.120
we can be you.

06:01.120 --> 06:01.520
All right.

06:01.520 --> 06:02.560
We want to take your life.

06:03.200 --> 06:06.720
Can we do, like, you know how they did with the doctors who,

06:07.520 --> 06:13.760
where they were like, the doctors, hey, remember, they like, one of them we forgot.

06:14.880 --> 06:18.240
So this, the whole numbers have been all ka-fluy this whole time.

06:18.240 --> 06:22.560
Do you think maybe we could, like, find some way through an accounting error

06:22.560 --> 06:26.240
that we've already released episode 420 and we missed it already?

06:26.240 --> 06:29.040
So it's like in the past and we don't have to stress about it anymore?

06:29.040 --> 06:33.680
I do know how to backdate episodes on Libsyn so that they drop into the feed in the middle.

06:34.400 --> 06:42.000
Considering that I get maybe five to six tweets a day about opportunities for jokes that I missed,

06:42.000 --> 06:46.080
really choice nugs, they're like, you know, you should have done this joke.

06:46.080 --> 06:51.840
I feel like just releasing episode 420 and making no comment about it would be the excuse to

06:51.840 --> 06:54.160
quit Twitter that I've been waiting for.

06:54.160 --> 06:54.640
All right.

06:54.640 --> 06:57.840
Listen, what if we re-release episode one of My Brother, My Brother and Me,

06:57.840 --> 07:02.000
but we just put the opening sort of eight measures of 311s,

07:02.000 --> 07:03.360
Amber is the color of your energy.

07:04.400 --> 07:07.040
But wait, we probably did that for episode 311, didn't we?

07:07.040 --> 07:08.080
I know we did.

07:08.080 --> 07:09.920
I don't have the transcript that handy.

07:10.960 --> 07:12.960
Uh, let's just do a regular show this time.

07:12.960 --> 07:14.240
We don't have to stress about it right now.

07:14.240 --> 07:14.880
What number is this?

07:14.880 --> 07:16.320
Travis didn't put it in again.

07:16.320 --> 07:17.040
419.

07:17.040 --> 07:18.240
419, are you kidding me?

07:18.240 --> 07:21.760
God, that's kind of like, man, 420 is really close at this

07:21.760 --> 07:22.480
point, huh?

07:22.480 --> 07:22.980
Yeah.

07:26.880 --> 07:29.280
I went to a new dentist's office today.

07:29.840 --> 07:34.400
All of my previous dentists have had TVs in their rooms, but this one has none of that.

07:34.400 --> 07:36.960
Close to the end of my appointment, because I didn't know where to look,

07:36.960 --> 07:40.800
I made slightly prolonged eye contact with the person cleaning my teeth.

07:40.800 --> 07:44.640
She stopped what she was doing, sighed and said, can you please not?

07:44.640 --> 07:45.440
Oh my God.

07:46.320 --> 07:46.960
No, they didn't.

07:47.520 --> 07:48.960
I don't believe it.

07:48.960 --> 07:50.480
The rest of my visit was super awkward.

07:50.480 --> 07:53.280
I didn't say anything, even after my teeth were cleaned.

07:53.280 --> 07:56.480
I have to go back to get a filling soon, and I am terrified.

07:56.480 --> 07:57.680
I will have the same person.

07:57.680 --> 07:59.120
Is there anything I can do?

07:59.120 --> 08:00.560
What should I do with my eyes?

08:00.560 --> 08:01.520
Was I in the wrong?

08:01.520 --> 08:03.440
That's from bad teeth in British Columbia.

08:03.440 --> 08:04.080
Holy shit.

08:04.080 --> 08:05.280
Everyone was in the wrong.

08:05.280 --> 08:06.400
I was in the wrong.

08:06.400 --> 08:09.040
I was in the wrong for reading this out loud.

08:09.040 --> 08:09.600
Fuck me.

08:10.240 --> 08:11.440
Justin thinks this didn't happen.

08:11.440 --> 08:15.040
Justin thinks this is a fake, somebody's trolling our forums.

08:15.040 --> 08:16.320
But I think I can totally see it.

08:16.320 --> 08:22.960
Imagine a hygienist deep in your pearly whites, and you just lock eyes with them the whole time.

08:22.960 --> 08:24.960
That's not acceptable behavior.

08:24.960 --> 08:25.600
It's not acceptable.

08:25.600 --> 08:32.720
But it's also not acceptable to not have, if not a TV playing old episodes of The Office

08:32.720 --> 08:39.280
or something right above you, a like a baby's mobile just sort of hanging above your head.

08:39.280 --> 08:41.840
Something to just sort of attract the eyes.

08:41.840 --> 08:46.880
Maybe it's just a small dot that somebody's drawn on the ceiling with a blue marker.

08:46.880 --> 08:51.760
Anything, anything, anything to give you a reason to not look into the eyes of my hygienist.

08:53.280 --> 08:54.240
I've never had.

08:54.240 --> 08:58.800
Dr. Judy Woodruff does not have any TVs at the top of her office.

08:58.800 --> 08:59.840
I've never had a TV.

08:59.840 --> 09:03.760
As long as I've ever had dental work in my entire life, I've never had a TV to look at.

09:03.760 --> 09:04.480
No one should.

09:04.480 --> 09:08.880
You should have to do like I do when I go to the dentist, which is sit, stare at the

09:08.880 --> 09:13.200
bright light, think about how my teeth will outlive me until they too are clean by time.

09:13.200 --> 09:14.720
That is what you should do at the dentist.

09:14.720 --> 09:19.920
You don't you don't need to watch old episodes of French or Friends or Friends.

09:19.920 --> 09:22.240
No one needs to watch old episodes of Friends French.

09:24.320 --> 09:26.000
Yeah, you fucked up.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.200
You fucked up bad.

09:27.200 --> 09:28.400
You can't go back.

09:28.400 --> 09:29.200
You can't go back.

09:29.200 --> 09:35.520
The good news is at least at my dentist, like the dental hygienist is like a specialist

09:35.520 --> 09:38.000
they bring in to do, you know, the wet work.

09:38.000 --> 09:41.520
And then when it's time to like, you know, rip out one of my terrible teeth and put in

09:41.520 --> 09:46.640
like a, you know, a monkey's tooth in there, then they they, you know, the dentist dentist

09:46.640 --> 09:47.440
steps in.

09:47.440 --> 09:49.760
So it should it should be a different person.

09:50.640 --> 09:53.440
But however, however, you here's the problem.

09:53.440 --> 09:58.000
Yeah, the problem is because I always I go to this very nice dentist here in Cincinnati

09:58.000 --> 10:03.920
and every time I have gone, the person who has, I guess, prepared me for the dentist

10:03.920 --> 10:07.760
who is ready to be for the dentist has been a different person.

10:07.760 --> 10:08.480
Every time.

10:08.480 --> 10:14.400
But that said, I also have to imagine they get together and discuss which of us like

10:14.400 --> 10:17.360
teethers gave them eye contact that day.

10:17.360 --> 10:18.960
Like it happened again.

10:18.960 --> 10:21.600
Who did you get weird eye contact from today?

10:21.600 --> 10:22.880
And everyone's going to know.

10:22.880 --> 10:28.080
That's all I can assume is like I spend so much of my life trying not to make eye contact

10:28.080 --> 10:28.800
with people.

10:28.800 --> 10:29.280
Sure.

10:29.280 --> 10:33.440
Like even people I think I'm supposed to make eye contact with because I don't want them

10:33.440 --> 10:38.720
to see the panic in my eyes of having to interact with another human being and be present with

10:38.720 --> 10:39.680
another human being.

10:40.320 --> 10:43.440
And so the idea of them being like, yeah, I looked right into his eyes.

10:43.440 --> 10:44.000
I saw his soul.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.280
He's terrified of everything.

10:45.280 --> 10:48.000
Like, I don't want them to know that much about me.

10:48.000 --> 10:55.120
OK, we need something here and we need something that is easily sort of reproducible in every

10:55.120 --> 10:56.080
dentist office.

10:56.080 --> 11:01.840
I want this shit to be as commonplace as like and that if you didn't have it, it would

11:01.840 --> 11:06.160
be like going to a dentist and they didn't have any sort of anesthetic at all.

11:06.160 --> 11:07.520
And you're like, wait, you don't have anesthetic?

11:07.520 --> 11:08.640
I'm fucking sorry.

11:08.640 --> 11:13.920
You can't come to this one because we don't have drills or there's no water at this dentist.

11:13.920 --> 11:16.720
It needs to be that sort of place.

11:17.600 --> 11:18.880
Sleep mask might be good.

11:18.880 --> 11:20.000
I was thinking like cool.

11:20.000 --> 11:25.040
Do they make like cool sunglasses that have like a little screen inside of them and you

11:25.040 --> 11:28.640
can put it on and be like a virtual not VR goggles, but like why not?

11:28.640 --> 11:31.920
Not VR goggles, well, expensive cool sunglasses.

11:31.920 --> 11:34.240
I've seen these sunglasses here describing.

11:34.240 --> 11:37.440
Yes, yes, I've seen these sunglasses.

11:37.440 --> 11:38.560
I believe they exist.

11:38.560 --> 11:45.440
Like Doc Brown wears in BTTF2 where he has the sunglasses on and they look like cool

11:45.440 --> 11:46.800
sunglasses with a TV in them.

11:47.360 --> 11:50.800
And you think those are less expensive than VR?

11:50.800 --> 11:53.840
You could get like the cardboard and put a phone in it.

11:53.840 --> 11:55.440
All right, fuck fine.

11:55.440 --> 11:59.520
I mean, there's no way TV sunglasses are cheaper than that.

11:59.520 --> 12:00.240
Okay, I've got it.

12:00.240 --> 12:00.720
I've got it.

12:00.720 --> 12:01.200
I've got it.

12:01.200 --> 12:01.760
I've got it.

12:01.760 --> 12:02.320
I've got it.

12:02.320 --> 12:02.880
He's got it.

12:02.880 --> 12:03.360
He's got it.

12:03.360 --> 12:04.080
He's got it, folks.

12:04.080 --> 12:04.560
Calm down.

12:04.560 --> 12:05.040
He's got it.

12:05.040 --> 12:09.520
Above every dentist chair, there will be live theater.

12:10.160 --> 12:15.760
There will be a live production of The Tempest or a funny thing.

12:15.760 --> 12:16.720
In the ceiling?

12:16.720 --> 12:17.440
In the ceiling.

12:17.440 --> 12:22.480
All the actors are suspended and they're doing a funny thing happened on the way to the forum.

12:22.480 --> 12:26.640
And you are delighted and transported and depending on what the procedure is you're

12:26.640 --> 12:29.600
getting, if you're just getting a cleaning, they're probably, you know, they're not

12:29.600 --> 12:32.240
going to make it to act two.

12:32.240 --> 12:33.840
So they'll get a nice little break.

12:33.840 --> 12:35.440
They're like, oh, that's the end of the play.

12:35.440 --> 12:37.200
And they'll walk away.

12:37.200 --> 12:38.240
And we do.

12:38.240 --> 12:40.240
Is there a more convenient way of doing this?

12:40.240 --> 12:41.840
That couldn't you just have them?

12:43.280 --> 12:44.640
We're thinking about this all wrong.

12:44.640 --> 12:53.680
If you put the performers on the stage, but then you have the tooth person oriented-

12:53.680 --> 12:54.800
Sideways, sideways.

12:54.800 --> 13:02.320
No, you have them oriented sort of vertically like Hannibal Lecter and just have the tooth,

13:02.320 --> 13:04.080
like give the tooth work.

13:04.080 --> 13:07.600
The dentist is loving it because their back was killing them.

13:07.600 --> 13:08.800
So they're excited.

13:08.800 --> 13:12.480
So now the dentist is just, you're standing and the dentist is standing.

13:12.480 --> 13:13.520
Everybody's standing.

13:13.520 --> 13:16.400
And you're just having standing dental work.

13:16.400 --> 13:17.360
You're having standing?

13:17.360 --> 13:23.040
No, you'll be tied to a stretcher and the dentist will be like, hey, listen, I've never

13:23.040 --> 13:24.400
seen this before.

13:24.400 --> 13:30.080
So please do let me know what's happening in it because I have not seen it.

13:30.080 --> 13:33.600
So if anything really cool is about to happen, please let me know.

13:33.600 --> 13:34.720
Let me pause real quick.

13:34.720 --> 13:40.880
I'll look up from your chompers and I will watch the sword fight and then I'm right back

13:40.880 --> 13:41.200
in there.

13:41.200 --> 13:46.640
The only other thing we can do is put the live theater inside of the patient's mouth

13:46.640 --> 13:50.800
so that the dentist will apparently focus on their fucking job instead of looking into

13:50.800 --> 13:51.920
your eyes.

13:51.920 --> 13:52.560
You know what I mean?

13:52.560 --> 13:54.320
Like it takes two to tango.

13:54.320 --> 13:55.280
You're right, Griffin.

13:56.000 --> 13:59.840
Why didn't you, you should have stopped what you were doing and be like, could you not?

13:59.840 --> 14:02.640
Why did you look at my peepers instead of my chompers?

14:02.640 --> 14:04.480
Hey, here's actually a very good question.

14:04.480 --> 14:05.440
Thank you, Travis.

14:05.440 --> 14:07.840
Why don't you look at my fucking teeth?

14:07.840 --> 14:08.480
How about that?

14:08.480 --> 14:12.320
Since you've got like whatever in there, like the thing that they pretend is counting your

14:12.320 --> 14:13.840
teeth, but it's actually scraping them.

14:13.840 --> 14:16.720
Since you got that in there, how about you focus on what you're doing?

14:16.720 --> 14:20.400
My eyes are up here, but my teeth are down there where you should be looking.

14:20.400 --> 14:22.480
They're pretty close and I can't fault you for that.

14:22.480 --> 14:24.560
But if you look at my eyes, you will see no holes.

14:24.560 --> 14:28.240
If you look in my mouth, it is Shia LaBeouf's holes in there.

14:28.240 --> 14:33.120
So like if I went to the eye doctor and I caught him staring at my teeth, I'd be like,

14:33.120 --> 14:34.320
what the fuck are you doing?

14:34.320 --> 14:35.840
That's not where I look from.

14:35.840 --> 14:37.120
That's not your world.

14:37.120 --> 14:38.960
That's where I taste to.

14:38.960 --> 14:40.640
Stay in your fucking lane.

14:40.640 --> 14:41.840
How about a Yahoo?

14:41.840 --> 14:42.720
Yeah, I love that.

14:43.280 --> 14:44.240
Some good ones.

14:44.240 --> 14:44.640
All right.

14:44.640 --> 14:45.760
Yahoo user.

14:47.120 --> 14:50.160
I don't know why I introduced it like that, but it is Drew Davenport.

14:50.160 --> 14:51.760
So he does use Yahoo, I think.

14:52.320 --> 14:54.480
I would argue he is a heavy user.

14:55.040 --> 14:55.760
Level 9000.

14:55.760 --> 14:56.160
Yeah, Drew.

14:56.160 --> 14:56.960
Drew had sent this in.

14:56.960 --> 14:57.360
Thanks, Drew.

14:57.360 --> 14:58.640
It's Yahoo Answers user.

14:58.640 --> 15:02.960
Horseygirl53534, 2534.

15:02.960 --> 15:07.920
Horseygirl3534 has 2% best answers.

15:09.200 --> 15:09.840
Not very good.

15:11.520 --> 15:12.880
But also not the worst it could be.

15:12.880 --> 15:15.120
2% of the time, she's right every time.

15:15.120 --> 15:18.880
She has 100% of the best questions though, because her question is in the movie Cars.

15:20.240 --> 15:21.360
I watched this recently.

15:21.360 --> 15:22.320
I'm excited about this.

15:23.520 --> 15:24.880
How would the Cars have kids?

15:26.640 --> 15:30.720
Me and my friend Shelby are watching Cars when she asked this question.

15:30.720 --> 15:31.680
So how would they?

15:31.680 --> 15:42.640
Now, I know you're probably wondering, is there illustrations of this concept on internet already?

15:42.640 --> 15:46.240
And me, Griffin, will say there is.

15:46.240 --> 15:52.240
And I'm saying that for you so that you don't have to go and find.

15:52.240 --> 15:53.840
Don't do this.

15:53.840 --> 15:56.400
Because I went and I find a lot.

15:56.400 --> 15:58.800
And some of it is Cars Cars.

15:58.800 --> 16:00.800
Some of it is Cars Peoples.

16:00.800 --> 16:04.080
There's one with a plane in the car.

16:04.080 --> 16:06.080
So there's sort of like planes in rescue.

16:10.080 --> 16:12.720
Can I say, so I just recently watched Cars 3.

16:13.920 --> 16:17.600
It's a very fine movie with wonderful voice acting.

16:17.600 --> 16:20.320
Many moments in which tears are brought to my eyes.

16:20.320 --> 16:21.280
Beautiful movie.

16:21.280 --> 16:27.360
But it does introduce the concept of new models of Cars,

16:27.360 --> 16:34.480
which I find deeply troubling as an analog comparison to people.

16:34.480 --> 16:34.880
Sure.

16:34.880 --> 16:36.880
Yeah, yeah.

16:36.880 --> 16:40.560
The idea, I wouldn't look at BB and be like, this is the new model.

16:41.120 --> 16:42.880
Ah, so much sleeker and better.

16:42.880 --> 16:44.160
Like, huh.

16:45.280 --> 16:48.000
The shitty thing is when you have to say that when you have a second kid,

16:48.000 --> 16:49.920
and then you have to say that to your first kid.

16:49.920 --> 16:50.720
Look at this.

16:50.720 --> 16:53.360
This is the new souped up version of you.

16:53.360 --> 16:56.320
If you were an iPhone, I would have traded you in already for this one.

16:56.320 --> 16:58.000
This is Baby X.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.280
This is Baby X.

16:59.280 --> 17:02.240
The most powerful baby with the best camera ever.

17:02.240 --> 17:05.040
And if I charge this baby, she's good all day.

17:05.040 --> 17:05.280
Yeah.

17:06.000 --> 17:06.480
There is-

17:06.480 --> 17:08.160
Don't worry about cloud saves with this one.

17:09.360 --> 17:14.880
You can talk all day about how they have sex, how the cars have sex.

17:14.880 --> 17:15.360
And I will.

17:15.360 --> 17:19.600
The question, the better question I want to ask is this.

17:20.400 --> 17:21.200
Why do they shit?

17:21.200 --> 17:30.480
There are so many scenes in the Cars franchise where Lightning McQueen says,

17:30.480 --> 17:31.680
I have to go take a shit.

17:33.600 --> 17:37.120
There are long sequences in every one of these fucking movies where they're like,

17:37.120 --> 17:37.920
where's Lightning?

17:37.920 --> 17:39.360
And he's like, I'm in the can.

17:39.360 --> 17:41.440
And it's pointless.

17:41.440 --> 17:42.960
It doesn't end the story forward.

17:42.960 --> 17:47.120
Why was it so important to John Lasseter that the cars shit so many times?

17:47.120 --> 17:50.800
I mean, what's weird is that there are no scenes of tomato shitting.

17:50.800 --> 17:54.240
Because they went to Larry and they were like, okay, Larry,

17:54.240 --> 17:55.600
so in this scene, you're gonna-

17:56.480 --> 17:57.200
And he's like, what?

17:57.200 --> 17:58.480
What are you saying?

17:58.480 --> 18:00.320
And they're like, in this scene, your character,

18:00.320 --> 18:02.400
tomato is going to take a big shit.

18:02.400 --> 18:05.440
And then he says, no, I'm sorry.

18:05.440 --> 18:06.000
I won't be-

18:07.840 --> 18:08.800
That is low brow humor.

18:08.800 --> 18:10.000
That is low brow humor.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.160
And it's sort of off my brand.

18:12.720 --> 18:15.040
I played Hamlet at Cambridge.

18:15.040 --> 18:18.240
So you will remove this scene or else I will not-

18:18.800 --> 18:20.720
I am a Nobel Prize winner, sir.

18:20.720 --> 18:24.240
I will, if you do not remove the scene, I will not be getting it done.

18:25.360 --> 18:29.040
I will remove your license to use my recorded voice

18:29.040 --> 18:32.960
in the car's branded electric toothbrush that says,

18:32.960 --> 18:35.760
go for it, pilgrim, brush those fuckers.

18:35.760 --> 18:38.560
I'll make you remove it.

18:38.560 --> 18:41.360
Stop brushing, you're gonna get conjovinus.

18:41.360 --> 18:42.800
I'll remove that too.

18:42.800 --> 18:45.920
You will not be able to use either of those sound samples.

18:45.920 --> 18:48.720
And if I might suggest a few cuts,

18:48.720 --> 18:52.560
there is a lot of shitting scenes already.

18:52.560 --> 18:53.600
So many scenes.

18:53.600 --> 18:57.360
Not just my character, but it seems everyone,

18:57.360 --> 18:59.520
this whole movie is shitting.

18:59.520 --> 19:02.080
I could suggest maybe a rewrite.

19:02.080 --> 19:03.520
Yeah, let me get in the studio.

19:03.520 --> 19:04.800
Okay, are we rolling?

19:04.800 --> 19:05.360
Okay.

19:05.360 --> 19:07.280
I forgot how to do key.

19:07.280 --> 19:10.880
So you can just use that and then it explains it all the way.

19:10.880 --> 19:15.440
I've forgotten everything I knew from when I was a human.

19:15.440 --> 19:21.120
Before I got, we're all cursed memories now.

19:22.160 --> 19:23.600
I don't remember what that,

19:23.600 --> 19:26.560
I don't even remember what my wife smelled like.

19:26.560 --> 19:29.920
I only remember how my engine revs.

19:29.920 --> 19:32.880
I'm broken, this is worse than hell.

19:34.160 --> 19:36.160
I can't remember my daughter's face.

19:37.120 --> 19:40.080
First place, I win, I win the big race.

19:40.080 --> 19:44.080
Get her finished, get her finished, get her finished.

19:44.080 --> 19:45.360
What was my favorite food?

19:45.360 --> 19:46.880
I don't remember how I ate.

19:47.520 --> 19:50.640
Anyway, polish my muffler or what the fuck.

19:50.640 --> 19:52.400
Now we are all cars.

19:52.400 --> 19:54.240
We're all of us cars.

19:54.240 --> 19:56.960
We've become cars, destroyer of worlds.

19:56.960 --> 20:01.040
Black Mirror, season five, starring Lerald the Cable Guy.

20:01.040 --> 20:02.720
Catch it.

20:02.720 --> 20:09.360
I have no mouth, but I must vroom for her.

20:09.360 --> 20:11.680
I think that cars can have kids.

20:11.680 --> 20:14.720
If Lightning McQueen and another character

20:14.720 --> 20:17.840
wanted to have a kid, they would just sort of,

20:17.840 --> 20:20.560
I think Lightning McQueen could pop off a headlight,

20:20.560 --> 20:23.920
and I think another car could drop a tire,

20:23.920 --> 20:25.920
and then somebody would have to build a car

20:25.920 --> 20:27.600
using those two components.

20:27.600 --> 20:31.440
It should have a scene where he pops off a headlight

20:31.440 --> 20:33.040
and another car pops off a tire

20:33.040 --> 20:35.200
and they try to figure out what to do with it then.

20:35.200 --> 20:37.680
They dig a hole and bury it.

20:37.680 --> 20:39.600
Is this gonna be a kid?

20:40.240 --> 20:42.880
We don't know what we're doing, but all the humans are dead.

20:42.880 --> 20:45.200
I love this sequel of Children of Men we're creating

20:45.200 --> 20:47.440
in this cars world where no one can have kids

20:47.440 --> 20:48.560
and they have to figure out a way.

20:48.560 --> 20:51.200
Now granted, I have not seen Children of Men,

20:51.200 --> 20:53.280
but I have seen cars many times.

20:53.280 --> 20:55.280
Damn, Trav, have you seen any movies?

20:55.280 --> 20:56.400
No, just cars.

20:56.400 --> 20:57.040
All right, yeah.

20:57.040 --> 20:58.000
Here's the thing, okay?

20:58.000 --> 21:00.640
Can I tell you the thing that threw me about cars?

21:00.640 --> 21:01.600
Okay, you ready for this?

21:01.600 --> 21:03.040
The cars are cars, yes, of course.

21:03.760 --> 21:06.640
The planes, the helicopters, they also have faces.

21:06.640 --> 21:08.720
They are also living vehicles.

21:08.720 --> 21:11.600
But the tiny bugs we see, they are cars.

21:11.600 --> 21:12.400
Cars.

21:12.400 --> 21:12.640
Yeah.

21:12.640 --> 21:13.520
What the fuck?

21:13.520 --> 21:13.840
Wait, what?

21:13.840 --> 21:15.280
Yeah, they're just having fun with it.

21:16.080 --> 21:18.640
How about another question?

21:19.360 --> 21:22.080
Because of an unfortunate turn of events,

21:22.080 --> 21:27.280
I am changing high schools to one with less than 100 kids.

21:27.280 --> 21:30.720
I was wondering, how do I become the coolest kid in school?

21:30.720 --> 21:33.520
Because of the low numbers, there is a chance for me

21:33.520 --> 21:34.880
to be the coolest kid in school.

21:35.520 --> 21:38.320
Thanks for the advice to making it happen in Massachusetts.

21:38.320 --> 21:39.520
I love that it's not just like,

21:39.520 --> 21:42.960
I know this sounds aspirational, but I've run the numbers.

21:42.960 --> 21:48.160
And it is feasible for me to become the coolest kid in school.

21:48.160 --> 21:52.960
The problem is at this point, I literally have no concept

21:53.760 --> 21:56.160
of what constitutes cool.

21:57.200 --> 22:00.240
I was going to say in school, but like really at all.

22:00.240 --> 22:01.280
Just generally speaking.

22:01.280 --> 22:01.840
Yeah.

22:02.400 --> 22:05.440
I have no answer to this.

22:05.440 --> 22:06.400
I'm at a no.

22:06.400 --> 22:08.480
Travis McElroy, do you have an answer to this?

22:08.480 --> 22:09.600
Do you have an answer to this?

22:09.600 --> 22:10.560
I'm a no.

22:10.560 --> 22:12.080
Griffin McElroy, do you have an answer to this?

22:13.040 --> 22:17.120
I mean, tech decks, but if not tech decks, then no.

22:17.120 --> 22:19.840
All right, I want to bring in a special,

22:19.840 --> 22:22.960
super special guest to help us answer this question.

22:22.960 --> 22:25.200
Elsie Fisher, star of the film 8th Grade,

22:25.200 --> 22:26.720
now in theaters everywhere.

22:26.720 --> 22:28.000
Elsie, welcome to the program.

22:28.000 --> 22:29.440
Hey, thank you for having me.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.240
Elsie, I'm going to bounce this off you

22:32.240 --> 22:33.520
and let me know if it sticks.

22:33.520 --> 22:36.160
Tech decks, are they still hot or not

22:36.160 --> 22:39.520
with sort of the 13 to 18 age bracket?

22:39.520 --> 22:40.640
Oh, they're very hot.

22:40.640 --> 22:42.000
They are very hot.

22:42.000 --> 22:42.720
Wait, God.

22:42.720 --> 22:43.440
Really?

22:43.440 --> 22:44.560
I'm not even joking though.

22:44.560 --> 22:45.840
They are very hot.

22:45.840 --> 22:47.120
You have to be joking.

22:47.120 --> 22:48.960
Elsie, get out.

22:48.960 --> 22:51.840
I've had plenty of children in my classes

22:51.840 --> 22:53.920
get their tech decks duped.

22:55.440 --> 22:59.360
Okay, I can't tell if you're messing with Elsie.

22:59.360 --> 23:00.560
I'm genuinely not.

23:00.560 --> 23:03.040
I swear, they're very hot.

23:03.040 --> 23:06.480
Yeah, wow, my collection still has value then.

23:06.480 --> 23:07.280
I'm so excited.

23:07.280 --> 23:08.960
Oh yeah, it's probably doubled.

23:08.960 --> 23:11.440
Is this how like sort of the statistics

23:11.440 --> 23:15.840
of high school popularity, is that even how it works?

23:15.840 --> 23:19.840
Or I guess in any sort of primary school level of popularity,

23:19.840 --> 23:22.480
if you clock in in a school with 100 kids in it,

23:23.120 --> 23:25.680
are you more likely or is it just if you're super cool,

23:25.680 --> 23:28.240
it doesn't matter what the size of the school is,

23:28.240 --> 23:29.760
you're going to reign supreme?

23:30.560 --> 23:31.200
I don't know.

23:31.200 --> 23:34.240
I mean, I think numbers can make a difference

23:34.880 --> 23:36.400
if it is a smaller school

23:36.400 --> 23:39.520
because there are just less options to pick from.

23:39.520 --> 23:41.360
So you have to do less to be cool.

23:41.360 --> 23:43.440
Yeah, okay, can I make a suggestion?

23:43.440 --> 23:44.880
And we'll see if this plays, right?

23:45.440 --> 23:46.080
Think of that.

23:46.080 --> 23:48.800
I've been watching a lot of cars, the movie Cars.

23:48.800 --> 23:50.560
Think of it like a racetrack, right?

23:50.560 --> 23:53.920
You don't have to go from bottom to beat in the first person.

23:53.920 --> 23:56.560
You just have to pass everyone along the way.

23:56.560 --> 24:00.240
So you need to find the 99th coolest person in school, pass them.

24:00.240 --> 24:01.600
And beat them up.

24:01.600 --> 24:02.960
No, no, no, Elsie.

24:02.960 --> 24:04.400
Oh, wow, all right.

24:04.960 --> 24:07.040
Okay, fine, I get it.

24:07.040 --> 24:08.960
You've listened to the show before, I thought,

24:08.960 --> 24:12.720
and we don't usually sort of endorse jumping people

24:12.720 --> 24:14.560
to become cooler than them.

24:14.560 --> 24:15.440
But that's Hollywood.

24:16.160 --> 24:18.480
Not since the double-digit episodes, at least.

24:19.920 --> 24:23.600
Elsie, I want to hit you with this theory, though.

24:23.600 --> 24:26.080
I understand what you're saying about the numbers are better.

24:26.080 --> 24:28.880
Let me alternate, though.

24:28.880 --> 24:30.960
Isn't it more statistically likely

24:30.960 --> 24:35.360
that you could be the least popular child in your school?

24:35.360 --> 24:37.200
Like, if you think of your kid came back

24:37.200 --> 24:39.440
and they were like, I'm the least popular kid in school,

24:39.440 --> 24:41.280
they're like, oh, there's like a thousand kids

24:41.280 --> 24:41.760
that go to that school.

24:41.760 --> 24:43.120
No way you're the least popular one.

24:43.120 --> 24:44.000
My kid came back and they're like,

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
I'm the least popular one out of a hundred?

24:46.000 --> 24:47.440
Eh, maybe.

24:47.440 --> 24:48.160
I don't know.

24:48.160 --> 24:48.960
It's possible.

24:49.520 --> 24:52.160
I think it is a risk you have to take

24:52.160 --> 24:53.680
if you go to a school of that size

24:53.680 --> 24:55.840
and you're on a quest to become the coolest.

24:55.840 --> 24:58.720
I think it's too easy to become the coolest

24:58.720 --> 24:59.920
if there's just a hundred kids.

24:59.920 --> 25:02.560
There needs to be a bad side, you know?

25:02.560 --> 25:04.560
Yeah, the danger.

25:04.560 --> 25:06.000
We found a school, right?

25:06.000 --> 25:07.440
And you know how there are schools for like,

25:07.440 --> 25:09.920
ah, we take only the best and brightest,

25:09.920 --> 25:11.520
you know, sinister, smartest kids.

25:11.520 --> 25:13.520
But like, there's a hundred kids.

25:13.520 --> 25:18.160
They were all the coolest kids at their hundred schools, right?

25:18.160 --> 25:20.960
And we have brought, this is cool school.

25:20.960 --> 25:22.720
It's only for the coolest kids.

25:22.720 --> 25:24.240
They're not even smart or whatever.

25:24.240 --> 25:25.920
That's just cool.

25:25.920 --> 25:30.560
You're literally describing the plot of like, 14 different animes right now.

25:33.360 --> 25:35.040
I think the opportunity that we're missing here

25:35.040 --> 25:38.320
is not the size of the student body.

25:38.880 --> 25:42.240
It is that you are a new student at this school.

25:42.240 --> 25:43.760
You're changing schools.

25:43.760 --> 25:45.120
You are brand new.

25:45.120 --> 25:47.840
And that is, that's your ticket.

25:47.840 --> 25:49.280
That's the opportunity.

25:49.280 --> 25:51.680
I think the like, new student mystique

25:51.680 --> 25:57.200
is going to penetrate a lot farther with a 100 person student body

25:57.200 --> 26:00.480
because everybody there is going to know there's a new student in town

26:00.480 --> 26:02.560
and their dad invented tech decks.

26:05.120 --> 26:05.840
Because here's the thing.

26:05.840 --> 26:08.480
What you want is you want a cool lie about yourself

26:08.480 --> 26:12.720
that makes yourself more interesting that is not easily Googlable.

26:13.360 --> 26:14.480
I have two vapes.

26:15.040 --> 26:15.600
Yeah, right?

26:15.600 --> 26:16.240
Just say that.

26:16.800 --> 26:17.520
Just say that.

26:17.520 --> 26:20.560
That was not a response to your question, Travis.

26:20.560 --> 26:24.800
That was Elsie just letting everybody know how many vapes she personally has.

26:24.800 --> 26:25.600
Yes, yeah.

26:25.600 --> 26:27.280
I like that it's two.

26:27.280 --> 26:31.280
It's my vape for me and then my vape for you, my friend.

26:31.280 --> 26:32.400
That's so sweet.

26:32.400 --> 26:34.800
What's your movie about, Elsie, so people can go see it

26:34.800 --> 26:37.440
and will want to go see it, I mean?

26:37.440 --> 26:41.600
It's about eighth graders and it's about a girl trying to live her life

26:41.600 --> 26:43.280
and maybe that is weird.

26:43.280 --> 26:44.640
And maybe your life is weird.

26:44.640 --> 26:47.760
And maybe that is weird and maybe your life is weird.

26:47.760 --> 26:48.880
So maybe you'll like it.

26:48.880 --> 26:54.240
I've struggled a lot since I've been sort of following this movie in the trades

26:54.240 --> 26:57.200
with spelling the word eighth.

26:57.200 --> 26:58.320
Boy, it's a tricky one.

26:59.120 --> 27:01.680
There's a lot of G's, H's and T's in that one.

27:01.680 --> 27:04.560
There's like three of each and I can never really remember

27:04.560 --> 27:06.480
how to assemble it correctly.

27:06.480 --> 27:09.200
E-I-G-H-T-H.

27:09.200 --> 27:11.040
That double H even sounds weird.

27:11.040 --> 27:13.600
Yeah, you don't even know where that's coming from.

27:13.600 --> 27:16.400
But it's not eighth grade, it's eighth grade.

27:16.400 --> 27:18.160
Could you change it to eighth grade?

27:20.560 --> 27:21.360
Is it too late?

27:22.640 --> 27:23.680
I think it's too late.

27:23.680 --> 27:25.360
It's already hit theaters, my friend.

27:25.360 --> 27:27.840
I'm assuming by the title, this is a horror film, right?

27:27.840 --> 27:28.480
Oh, yes.

27:28.480 --> 27:31.680
My experience in eighth grade, I don't think they could come up

27:31.680 --> 27:33.200
with a scarier name for a film.

27:35.360 --> 27:37.680
When I was in eighth grade, I had a tooth come loose

27:37.680 --> 27:39.600
and I went to the bathroom and pulled it out

27:39.600 --> 27:42.560
and it was like the first or second day of eighth grade.

27:42.560 --> 27:43.920
And I was on a new floor.

27:43.920 --> 27:46.960
In eighth grade at Comac, you were on the first floor.

27:46.960 --> 27:48.800
And so I went to the bathroom, I was looking in the mirror,

27:48.800 --> 27:51.920
pulled the tooth out and a door to one of the bathroom stalls

27:51.920 --> 27:54.800
opened behind me and a woman did come out

27:54.800 --> 27:56.640
because I was in the women's restroom.

27:56.640 --> 27:59.120
And I didn't know because I was new to the floor

27:59.120 --> 28:01.520
and they saw me pulling a tooth out of my fucking head.

28:01.520 --> 28:04.640
So like worst, I was done pretty much after that.

28:04.640 --> 28:07.600
I literally can't remember anything about eighth grade,

28:07.600 --> 28:10.320
which makes me think it was incredibly terrible.

28:10.320 --> 28:13.040
Maybe my eighth grade experience was just an alien abduction

28:13.040 --> 28:15.600
and I've just like replaced those memories.

28:15.600 --> 28:16.560
I don't know.

28:16.560 --> 28:20.560
In my eighth grade year, I was a furry and I know this

28:20.560 --> 28:23.600
because there are many photos of it.

28:23.600 --> 28:27.280
Many photos of you like drawing furry culture?

28:27.280 --> 28:30.960
No, no, like I used to wear ears and a tail to school.

28:30.960 --> 28:31.680
All right.

28:31.680 --> 28:33.120
There's nothing wrong with that.

28:33.120 --> 28:34.000
You don't have a wrong one.

28:34.000 --> 28:34.720
That's radical.

28:34.720 --> 28:35.600
We love furries.

28:35.600 --> 28:37.280
We fully support that.

28:37.280 --> 28:38.160
Yeah, absolutely.

28:38.160 --> 28:41.200
I'm so used to this furry discrimination in my real life.

28:41.200 --> 28:43.120
You've come to the right place.

28:43.120 --> 28:45.760
We are, I would say, reckless in our support of furries.

28:45.760 --> 28:48.800
That's character development right there.

28:48.800 --> 28:51.040
Thank you, yes.

28:51.040 --> 28:53.440
Thank you for finally heaping the praise on us

28:53.440 --> 28:55.360
that our dad continues to withhold.

28:56.160 --> 28:58.320
Elsie Fisher, eighth grade, is in theaters now.

28:58.320 --> 29:00.480
People can go see it even if they can't spell it.

29:01.360 --> 29:03.840
And I think everybody should go do that, don't you?

29:04.560 --> 29:05.600
Are you asking Elsie?

29:05.600 --> 29:06.640
I'm asking Elsie.

29:06.640 --> 29:07.600
Oh, okay.

29:07.600 --> 29:09.120
Yes, please go see it.

29:09.120 --> 29:12.240
Elsie Fisher, thank you for attending our program.

29:12.240 --> 29:13.920
Oh, thank you so much for having me.

29:15.120 --> 29:16.720
What a natural way to phrase that.

29:16.720 --> 29:20.080
What a good person way of saying that, human, save it.

29:22.160 --> 29:23.600
Elsie, we appreciate your guidance.

29:23.600 --> 29:25.600
Everybody go see eighth grade in theaters now.

29:26.400 --> 29:30.320
But for the moment, we don't have big Hollywood dreams.

29:30.320 --> 29:34.160
We gotta earn our money the old-fashioned way.

29:34.160 --> 29:39.680
Right, so yeah, talking about sponsors for E-Savvy companies on the internet.

29:39.680 --> 29:50.640
Let's go to the money's end.

29:50.640 --> 29:53.920
Can I tell you all about Casper?

29:53.920 --> 29:55.360
Um, yeah, I guess.

29:55.360 --> 29:56.320
Okay, great.

29:56.320 --> 30:00.960
So we travel a lot, we do a lot of tours, I go to a lot of conventions and stuff.

30:00.960 --> 30:07.600
And there's nothing like sleeping on a shitty hotel bed to make me miss,

30:07.600 --> 30:11.520
I'm going to say it, my best friend, my Casper mattress.

30:12.240 --> 30:18.720
Yeah, a lot of these hotels use mattresses from Bastard, which is the evil Casper.

30:18.720 --> 30:25.600
And they are not soft, they come in a box that's bigger than the mattress and they deflate.

30:25.600 --> 30:31.840
And they're not soft and they're not made out of, you know, soft materials.

30:31.840 --> 30:34.720
And so I hate Bastard, I love Casper.

30:34.720 --> 30:36.800
Bastard uses like eight middlemen.

30:36.800 --> 30:40.480
And so it just really jacks up the price where Casper uses no middleman.

30:40.480 --> 30:42.640
So it like decreases the price and Bastard's like,

30:42.640 --> 30:44.880
we can make our mattresses more expensive.

30:47.760 --> 30:52.000
They also, Casper combines multiple supportive memory phones for a quality sleep service

30:52.000 --> 30:54.560
with the right amount of both sink and bounce.

30:54.560 --> 30:59.120
You can be sure of your purchase with Casper's 100 night risk-free sleep on it trial.

30:59.120 --> 31:02.160
And right now you can get $50 towards select mattresses

31:02.160 --> 31:07.440
by visiting Casper.com, that's C-A-S-P-E-R.com slash my brother.

31:07.440 --> 31:10.720
And use the promo code mybrother, all one word, at checkout.

31:10.720 --> 31:12.080
Terms and conditions apply.

31:13.040 --> 31:16.400
Juice, tell me about Quip, because I know that you like to have them in there.

31:17.440 --> 31:21.040
If you have nasty teeth or a nasty mouth even,

31:21.040 --> 31:27.600
like however, wherever you're nasty up there, Quip is a great, great way

31:27.600 --> 31:31.120
to finally kind of get things in order up there.

31:31.120 --> 31:35.840
It's a new electric toothbrush that's a fraction of the cost of bulkier brushes

31:35.840 --> 31:39.760
and packs premium vibrations for a perfect two-minute clean.

31:39.760 --> 31:44.160
You know, I used to use an electric toothbrush from one of the big brands

31:44.720 --> 31:49.600
and it took up like a bunch of space on my counter in my bathroom

31:49.600 --> 31:52.000
and very inconvenient.

31:52.000 --> 31:56.320
Quip is great because it has this like little caddy, basically,

31:56.320 --> 31:59.840
that has a sticky strip on it that you can basically stick anywhere.

31:59.840 --> 32:02.480
Get it out of the way and your toothbrush just hangs out there.

32:02.480 --> 32:05.280
And when you're going on a trip or whatever,

32:05.280 --> 32:09.360
you just flip the Quip over and put it back into the container.

32:09.360 --> 32:10.480
And then it's like a travel case.

32:10.480 --> 32:14.080
Like I always say, got travel, just flip the Quip.

32:14.080 --> 32:15.600
Just flip the Quip, I always say it.

32:15.600 --> 32:19.840
And Quip has, it pulses every 30 seconds to let you know,

32:19.840 --> 32:21.280
like brush a different part of your mouth.

32:21.280 --> 32:23.600
And then at two minutes, I think it's like a different pulse

32:23.600 --> 32:27.680
to let you know like you finally did it, believe it or not.

32:28.480 --> 32:32.560
It also helps fix the problem of remembering to change your toothbrush

32:32.560 --> 32:34.800
with its time because every three months,

32:34.800 --> 32:37.520
they ship you a new one for just five bucks.

32:37.520 --> 32:43.520
So, and it's actually very satisfying because they use the old brush head

32:43.520 --> 32:44.640
right before you throw it away.

32:44.640 --> 32:48.800
You use that to clean the like inside of the brush.

32:48.800 --> 32:51.200
I find it immensely satisfying when you throw it away

32:51.200 --> 32:53.760
and it's all perfectly clean and spotless and everything.

32:53.760 --> 32:55.600
But Quip starts at just $25.

32:55.600 --> 33:00.880
And if you go to getquip.com slash my brother right now,

33:00.880 --> 33:05.680
you'll get your first refill pack free with a Quip electric toothbrush.

33:05.680 --> 33:12.240
That's getquip, G-E-T-Q-U-I-P.com slash my brother.

33:12.240 --> 33:14.560
Catch it, catch the wave.

33:14.560 --> 33:18.560
I want to tell you all about this next Jumbotron because...

33:19.280 --> 33:19.760
Okay.

33:19.760 --> 33:21.040
Yeah, I'm really excited about it.

33:21.040 --> 33:28.000
It was sent in by Nick Palumbo for my dearest Andrea who says,

33:28.720 --> 33:32.640
since introducing you to the McElhory, I'm done, I quit.

33:32.640 --> 33:35.280
If you can't even get the name right, I'm walking.

33:35.280 --> 33:36.960
Nick, Nick-less.

33:36.960 --> 33:41.760
Let me fix your doo-doo mess here, Nick.

33:41.760 --> 33:46.480
Anyway, since introducing you to the McElhory family of products.

33:46.480 --> 33:48.080
It might be an inside joke, Griffin.

33:48.720 --> 33:51.280
It is like their funny joke where they disrespect us.

33:51.280 --> 33:53.760
Disrespect our whole honor.

33:53.760 --> 33:55.040
Our brand, our brand.

33:55.680 --> 33:59.120
Since introducing you to the McElhory family of products, Nick.

34:00.560 --> 34:02.160
I can't get past this first sentence, guys.

34:02.160 --> 34:03.440
It's just a doo-doo mess.

34:03.440 --> 34:08.240
Yes, but since introducing you to the McElhory family of products

34:08.240 --> 34:10.880
was the second smartest thing I did in December 2015,

34:10.880 --> 34:12.240
asking you out was the first.

34:12.240 --> 34:15.520
I figured it's fitting for me to use them to wish you a happy birthday.

34:15.520 --> 34:16.480
Happy birthday.

34:16.480 --> 34:20.080
I love you so much and I can't wait to marry the fuck out of you this August.

34:20.080 --> 34:21.680
Yours forever and always, Nick.

34:22.400 --> 34:23.680
Why did you say his name right?

34:23.680 --> 34:25.120
You should have said yours forever.

34:25.120 --> 34:25.920
McKick.

34:25.920 --> 34:29.280
Yeah, Ken, which is Nick backwards.

34:29.280 --> 34:31.600
Oh, burn him.

34:31.600 --> 34:35.600
Now they did want this message March 5th and it is August

34:35.600 --> 34:37.760
which is when the wedding is going to happen.

34:37.760 --> 34:40.800
So hopefully we're getting in before the wedding so I can let you all know.

34:40.800 --> 34:44.160
I hope many happy returns and many more.

34:44.160 --> 34:45.840
Listen, we all made some mistakes.

34:45.840 --> 34:46.640
You know what I mean?

34:46.640 --> 34:50.160
We all make some mistakes and I'm really not mad about it.

34:50.160 --> 34:54.480
Congratulations on your love and happy birthday a long time ago.

34:54.480 --> 34:59.200
All right, this message is for Aubrey and it's from Matt.

34:59.200 --> 35:04.480
I was so excited to get a Jumbotron that I didn't plan anything specific to say.

35:04.480 --> 35:08.000
Other than I love you and I hope this message from those good, good boys,

35:08.000 --> 35:10.080
the McElroy's brightens your day.

35:10.080 --> 35:14.560
Can't wait to be home with you and the snuggle boys planning our next adventure.

35:14.560 --> 35:18.320
Always remain on the smooth tip and always keep it digital.

35:18.320 --> 35:20.240
Love, Matt, Max and Henry.

35:20.240 --> 35:23.840
Now I don't know who the snuggle boys are.

35:23.840 --> 35:29.120
Yeah, but it sounds like the best and maybe also creepiest kind of like henchmen

35:29.120 --> 35:30.400
I've ever heard of.

35:30.400 --> 35:32.400
Yeah, me and the snuggle boys.

35:32.400 --> 35:35.360
I could come around and show you who's boss.

35:35.360 --> 35:36.480
You think it's an ironic name?

35:36.480 --> 35:41.680
You think they're like, you know, knife enthusiasts,

35:42.640 --> 35:45.520
but they call themselves the snuggle boys kind of like the wet bandits

35:45.520 --> 35:50.160
and it sounds like, you know, a harmless name, but really they did try to kill a kid.

35:50.160 --> 35:50.480
Yeah.

35:50.480 --> 35:53.600
So, Justin, you want to read this last one?

35:53.600 --> 35:55.200
Absolutely.

35:55.200 --> 35:58.800
This is a message from Caroline and it's for Joe and it says,

35:58.800 --> 36:01.920
Hey Joe, a message to my favorite boy from your faith boys.

36:01.920 --> 36:04.320
You told me not to spend my money on this,

36:04.320 --> 36:07.760
but despite having an econ degree, I'm terrible with money.

36:09.120 --> 36:09.440
Fine.

36:10.080 --> 36:16.560
Hope you have a great 24th birthday and that all your magical dreams come true.

36:16.560 --> 36:21.840
You're an awesome photographer, guitarist, and bro love your middle sister.

36:21.840 --> 36:27.040
And that birthday did go ahead and pop off a little early this year on May 9th.

36:27.040 --> 36:31.200
So we are hoping Joe's still in kind of the celebratory mood.

36:31.200 --> 36:33.200
Just a quick cue.

36:36.160 --> 36:40.560
Hello, I'm Oliver Wong, DJ, scholar, and journalist.

36:40.560 --> 36:44.560
And I'm Morgan Rhodes, music supervisor and stiletto devotee.

36:44.560 --> 36:48.880
And we host Heat Rocks, a podcast where we invite our favorite musicians,

36:48.880 --> 36:53.440
writers, and scholars to talk about the albums that have changed their lives.

36:53.440 --> 36:55.360
Morgan, what exactly is a Heat Rock?

36:55.360 --> 36:58.800
It's a record that's like hot fire, combustible.

36:58.800 --> 37:01.360
Basically, just a really, really good album.

37:01.360 --> 37:04.800
We've taken a deep dive into Nigerian funk from the 70s.

37:04.800 --> 37:08.640
He kind of had like a bad reputation in town as just being like a sketchy dude.

37:09.840 --> 37:13.040
And he was just making music that for thousands of miles around him,

37:13.040 --> 37:15.280
he was the only person doing anything like that.

37:15.280 --> 37:18.400
1980s teen comedy soundtracks.

37:18.400 --> 37:22.640
This soundtrack always felt the same to me as like when I would find a great

37:22.640 --> 37:26.880
blazer at a thrift store that I could, I was like, oh, this is going to be me now.

37:26.880 --> 37:32.400
We've talked about Prince, Boys to Men, Kendrick Lamar, and everything in between.

37:32.400 --> 37:35.040
Heat Rocks, every Thursday here on Maximum Fun.

37:35.040 --> 37:42.640
I got a haunted doll watch here.

37:42.640 --> 37:44.160
It's fresh, fresh.

37:44.160 --> 37:50.320
I'm seeing more people that are not willing to weave the fiction

37:51.520 --> 37:55.680
selling a haunted doll would normally require.

37:55.680 --> 37:56.720
What the fuck are they doing?

37:56.720 --> 37:57.600
That's the whole thing.

37:57.600 --> 37:58.240
That's like the whole-

37:58.240 --> 37:59.520
It's a doll, whatever.

38:00.080 --> 38:04.160
But I have, as an artist, we must, and our source material changes.

38:04.160 --> 38:10.640
You know, if you're an artist who presents themselves in their autumnal photography,

38:10.640 --> 38:15.440
when winter does eventually come, you have to find a way to adapt and apply those skills

38:15.440 --> 38:19.920
to the fallen leaves and the frost covered branches.

38:19.920 --> 38:22.400
And in much the same way, I have done this thing.

38:23.360 --> 38:28.720
I do want to show you all the, oh, it's not that.

38:28.720 --> 38:31.040
Let me share my screen real fast so you can see.

38:32.400 --> 38:33.200
Okay, there we go.

38:33.200 --> 38:36.560
Oh, fucking holy shit, Justin.

38:36.560 --> 38:38.320
Look deep into its eyes, guys.

38:38.320 --> 38:40.320
No, could you not?

38:40.320 --> 38:43.280
It looks like, okay, this doll-

38:43.920 --> 38:44.480
No.

38:44.480 --> 38:47.200
The subject line is just, okay, I need to stop sharing my screen.

38:47.200 --> 38:47.840
Yes, please.

38:48.560 --> 38:52.720
The subject line on this doll is just haunted doll, negative spirit.

38:52.720 --> 38:53.360
That's it.

38:53.360 --> 38:54.000
That's all you get.

38:54.000 --> 39:00.560
The doll itself looks like a baby version of Gene Hackman from Superman.

39:00.560 --> 39:00.880
Yes.

39:00.880 --> 39:02.160
Yes.

39:02.160 --> 39:06.080
It's, again, it's like creepy, but in a little bit of a lazy way.

39:06.080 --> 39:08.560
It looks like a doctored haunted doll.

39:08.560 --> 39:12.160
The starting bid, and there's zero of them, is a dollar.

39:12.800 --> 39:14.080
And it ends in three days.

39:14.080 --> 39:18.480
So it will have expired by the time you get this.

39:19.120 --> 39:29.360
So there's just kind of the eBay user HermaMcDon, maybe, put this description up.

39:29.360 --> 39:33.760
And it just says this, upon receiving this negative spirit, my cat died.

39:36.480 --> 39:36.800
What?

39:37.360 --> 39:43.520
Upon receiving this negative spirit, my cat died as I was getting ready to go get Fletcher

39:43.520 --> 39:44.480
from the mailbox.

39:45.120 --> 39:47.520
That is the name of this doll, by the way.

39:47.520 --> 39:52.320
It is great because what is great about this is one of this-

39:52.320 --> 39:54.640
This is like, I want to take you inside a little bit now.

39:54.640 --> 40:03.360
One of the pictures of this doll is the eBay listing from the time this person bought this

40:03.360 --> 40:03.860
doll.

40:07.360 --> 40:12.400
So it says haunted doll Fletcher, terrifying negative spirit, must go now.

40:12.400 --> 40:13.760
We'll kill cats.

40:13.760 --> 40:14.320
We'll kill cats.

40:14.320 --> 40:15.360
From distance.

40:15.360 --> 40:20.240
This person bought this and is like, oh, actually, no way.

40:20.240 --> 40:21.440
No fucking way.

40:21.440 --> 40:22.080
This sucks.

40:22.080 --> 40:24.080
My cat died when I was going to pick up this doll.

40:24.080 --> 40:24.720
You were right.

40:24.720 --> 40:25.280
I'm sorry.

40:25.280 --> 40:26.480
I didn't know what I was fucking with.

40:27.120 --> 40:28.720
So they're trying to get it out in a hurry.

40:29.600 --> 40:33.600
It said, upon receiving this negative spirit, my cat died as I was getting ready to go get

40:33.600 --> 40:34.800
Fletcher from the mailbox.

40:35.520 --> 40:38.080
Days later, washer broke and-

40:38.080 --> 40:40.000
You're putting that on the same level?

40:40.000 --> 40:41.680
I'm going to read you one sentence.

40:41.680 --> 40:43.120
I love that washer.

40:43.120 --> 40:45.040
I'm going to finish a sentence.

40:45.040 --> 40:46.080
So the cat did die.

40:46.080 --> 40:47.040
This is one sentence.

40:47.040 --> 40:54.560
Days later, washer broke and car accident, hitting a tree, my stepson.

40:54.560 --> 40:55.680
Oh my God.

40:57.600 --> 41:02.000
How are we ranking these things by including them in the same breath?

41:02.560 --> 41:03.200
Days later.

41:03.760 --> 41:05.920
Hey, so how's your life going?

41:06.640 --> 41:08.240
It's been kind of a wild few days.

41:09.680 --> 41:13.120
Got a creepy doll and my cat died.

41:13.120 --> 41:14.400
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

41:14.400 --> 41:15.120
It's okay.

41:15.120 --> 41:18.640
Oh, and well, my washer broke.

41:18.640 --> 41:20.000
Well, that's more of a mild annoyance.

41:20.000 --> 41:20.480
I don't know.

41:21.280 --> 41:24.240
And also a car accident, hitting a tree, my stepson.

41:25.440 --> 41:30.400
Yeah, I don't really know that you were driving your stepson as if he was some sort of turbo

41:30.400 --> 41:32.240
teen into a tree?

41:32.880 --> 41:37.600
Or it kind of sounds like you hit a tree and then went on to hit your stepson.

41:37.600 --> 41:41.680
It's a small tree, a small tree, but a big son.

41:41.680 --> 41:45.920
And I went through the first and rammed right damn right into the second.

41:45.920 --> 41:50.240
Hit my sturdy stepson and fucked up the tree.

41:50.240 --> 41:50.880
Son was fine.

41:50.880 --> 41:53.200
I think tree caught most of the momentum of it.

41:54.160 --> 41:55.840
Son was annoyed.

41:55.840 --> 41:59.520
I just want my money back and peace of mind back.

42:02.240 --> 42:06.640
It's like they don't want to be haunted by the negative spirit anymore, but they are

42:06.640 --> 42:09.040
going to go ahead and get a return on the investment.

42:09.040 --> 42:10.240
They're going to get the ROI.

42:10.240 --> 42:13.840
And yes, I did buy this negative spirit on eBay.

42:13.840 --> 42:17.120
Well, okay, so you've owned up to it at least.

42:17.120 --> 42:18.160
That's something.

42:18.160 --> 42:22.880
I do collect other paranormal dolls, but this one carries death with it.

42:23.360 --> 42:24.160
Any questions?

42:24.160 --> 42:24.960
Please ask.

42:25.440 --> 42:26.160
A dollar.

42:26.960 --> 42:27.600
Good luck.

42:27.600 --> 42:28.800
I've seen enough.

42:28.800 --> 42:30.080
That's the last sentence.

42:30.080 --> 42:31.120
Good luck.

42:31.120 --> 42:32.160
I've seen enough.

42:32.960 --> 42:38.480
Here's, I do collect other paranormal dolls, but this one carries death with it.

42:38.480 --> 42:40.160
Any questions?

42:40.160 --> 42:40.800
Please ask.

42:41.920 --> 42:43.520
I don't have any fucking questions.

42:43.520 --> 42:47.200
I think you summed it up pretty good with, it carries death with it.

42:47.200 --> 42:50.240
I think that's actually everything I needed to know.

42:50.240 --> 42:51.200
This is a first.

42:51.840 --> 42:57.280
This is the first time I've ever actually been even remotely scared by one of these

42:57.280 --> 43:02.000
things because this description, this is, Justin's not kidding, that's the end of it.

43:02.000 --> 43:08.800
The lack of sort of a three act narrative structure to this, as is usually the case in

43:08.800 --> 43:14.960
these sales pitches, and sort of the last couple sentiments that they include in there

43:14.960 --> 43:20.640
really sort of drives home the fiction that this is a person who has bought and sold haunted

43:20.640 --> 43:26.080
dolls and we have a lot of fun here, folks, but this one is really full of death.

43:26.080 --> 43:28.160
So I'm going to need this off my hands, Ace.

43:28.160 --> 43:32.480
It's somebody breaking ka-fabe for a minute, like, listen, I know I talked about like,

43:32.480 --> 43:36.080
oh, he was a doll and he died in a bank heist.

43:36.080 --> 43:37.440
But my cat did die.

43:37.440 --> 43:41.280
I ran over a tree and my son and that washer that I just bought.

43:41.280 --> 43:43.200
I don't even have time to formulate a good sentence.

43:43.200 --> 43:46.000
I really, I need this thing out.

43:46.000 --> 43:49.680
It's fun talking about Stephanie and she can make orbs and she changes the radio to the

43:49.680 --> 43:52.720
station she was listening to when she died in the car accident at prom night.

43:52.720 --> 43:53.360
That's fun.

43:53.360 --> 43:59.280
This one, this one killed, this one killed my cat and broke my washer and did a car accident

43:59.280 --> 44:01.920
with my son, stepson into a tree, I guess.

44:01.920 --> 44:02.720
Who I love.

44:02.720 --> 44:03.760
I love very much.

44:03.760 --> 44:04.880
I love him so much.

44:06.160 --> 44:07.120
This has been a bad.

44:07.120 --> 44:08.480
Yeah, I just need this fucking doll.

44:08.480 --> 44:10.160
You are going to have to pay me for it, though.

44:10.160 --> 44:11.840
But the fact that it is $1.

44:12.560 --> 44:14.880
I'm not like, I'm a little bit scared of this.

44:14.880 --> 44:17.040
I have, I have, I do have some fear.

44:17.040 --> 44:17.440
You want it?

44:17.440 --> 44:18.400
I'll get it for you.

44:18.400 --> 44:19.520
No, I super, super don't.

44:20.320 --> 44:21.120
Yeah, don't.

44:21.120 --> 44:22.320
No, I don't want it.

44:22.320 --> 44:23.760
You're buying it right now, aren't you?

44:23.760 --> 44:25.920
No, I'm respecting you.

44:25.920 --> 44:26.960
I'm old enough now.

44:26.960 --> 44:29.200
I've been around the block enough times to know.

44:29.200 --> 44:30.800
Um, how about another question?

44:30.800 --> 44:32.320
Well, can I ask you guys a question?

44:33.120 --> 44:33.760
Uh, sure.

44:33.760 --> 44:35.600
This is not really the format, but okay.

44:35.600 --> 44:36.160
You're right.

44:36.160 --> 44:36.960
Okay.

44:36.960 --> 44:45.120
Mini man scudthumper, maker of wood, worn wood, shrub-ruster, sky-mocker, rave,

44:45.120 --> 44:47.040
poorly pusher, windslave.

44:47.040 --> 44:47.920
What am I?

44:49.280 --> 44:49.520
Yeah.

44:49.520 --> 44:50.560
Oh, fuck me.

44:51.360 --> 44:51.840
Yeah, we're back.

44:51.840 --> 44:53.200
Riddle me this, boys.

44:53.200 --> 44:54.000
Yeah, sure.

44:54.000 --> 44:55.840
We need a stinger or something for the riddles.

44:57.280 --> 44:58.160
What am I?

44:58.160 --> 44:58.640
A kite.

44:59.600 --> 45:00.880
No, dummy.

45:01.440 --> 45:02.000
A balloon.

45:02.640 --> 45:03.840
Stop being so dumb.

45:04.480 --> 45:05.040
Justin?

45:06.240 --> 45:12.080
I wanted to mention our friend Adderall Fye, who plays Chunt on Hello from the Magic Tavern,

45:13.360 --> 45:16.160
started this great podcast called Hey Riddle Riddle.

45:16.160 --> 45:21.760
It's a great show where he and two other great improv comedians solve lateral thinking puzzles

45:21.760 --> 45:22.960
and it's very fun.

45:22.960 --> 45:26.160
If you like riddles, you should check that show out.

45:26.160 --> 45:29.760
If you hate riddles, welcome to our great segment.

45:30.560 --> 45:31.680
Hey Riddle Riddle.

45:31.680 --> 45:32.160
No, wait.

45:32.160 --> 45:33.600
I don't think we should still-

45:33.600 --> 45:35.040
Can I get you with riddle me piss?

45:37.120 --> 45:38.080
Okay, riddle me piss.

45:38.080 --> 45:38.800
That's excellent.

45:38.800 --> 45:39.520
Okay.

45:39.520 --> 45:40.160
So Travis-

45:40.160 --> 45:45.680
Mini man scudthumper, maker of wood, shrub-ruster, sky-mocker-

45:45.680 --> 45:48.080
Can you say the word comma?

45:48.080 --> 45:49.280
Can you just say the word comma?

45:49.280 --> 45:49.840
Yes.

45:49.840 --> 45:50.480
Yes.

45:50.480 --> 46:00.400
Mini man scudthumper comma, maker of worn wood comma, shrub-ruster comma, sky-mocker comma,

46:00.400 --> 46:02.560
rave exclamation point, portly pusher-

46:02.560 --> 46:03.520
What's the last one?

46:03.520 --> 46:04.400
What's that one?

46:04.400 --> 46:05.120
What's that one?

46:05.120 --> 46:05.680
What's that one?

46:05.680 --> 46:06.180
Rave?

46:07.200 --> 46:07.840
Rave?

46:07.840 --> 46:08.880
Is just the one?

46:09.520 --> 46:16.720
Rave exclamation point, portly pusher comma, wind slave, that's hyphenated, period.

46:16.720 --> 46:17.600
What am I?

46:17.600 --> 46:20.000
It's not a kite.

46:20.000 --> 46:22.800
We've established it's not a kite.

46:22.800 --> 46:25.440
I mean, but most of those things you said aren't fucking words.

46:25.440 --> 46:28.000
So that feels like a bad thing to have in a riddle.

46:28.960 --> 46:30.880
I'm just going to tell you now.

46:30.880 --> 46:31.380
Okay.

46:31.840 --> 46:34.000
It's the ocean, I guess.

46:34.720 --> 46:35.840
Does it say that?

46:35.840 --> 46:37.280
Holy shit, Travis.

46:37.280 --> 46:38.480
That's the answer.

46:38.480 --> 46:39.520
I know.

46:40.320 --> 46:47.360
Hickory dickory dock, the mouse ran up the clock, the clock struck one,

46:47.360 --> 46:50.000
then down did come.

46:50.000 --> 46:52.240
Hickory dickory dock.

46:52.800 --> 46:53.680
What am I?

46:54.560 --> 46:55.120
A mouse?

46:56.000 --> 46:57.120
No, dumb shit.

46:57.680 --> 46:58.240
What is it?

46:59.040 --> 47:00.080
The guillotine.

47:05.680 --> 47:06.160
All right.

47:06.160 --> 47:08.640
We got one sent to us actually by Matthew McGreevy.

47:08.640 --> 47:09.200
Thanks, Matt.

47:10.000 --> 47:10.960
This is the riddle.

47:12.160 --> 47:14.080
You go into the woods to get it.

47:14.800 --> 47:16.560
Then you sit down to find it.

47:16.560 --> 47:18.640
Then you go home because you couldn't find it.

47:20.080 --> 47:21.600
I have no idea.

47:21.600 --> 47:22.000
Fish?

47:22.560 --> 47:24.560
You go into the woods to get fish.

47:24.560 --> 47:26.400
Then you sit down to find fish.

47:26.400 --> 47:28.960
Then you go home because you couldn't find fish.

47:28.960 --> 47:30.240
Maybe, maybe.

47:30.240 --> 47:31.200
A place to sit.

47:31.920 --> 47:34.480
No, the answer is a splinter.

47:36.480 --> 47:36.960
What?

47:36.960 --> 47:38.880
Yeah, you go into the woods to get a splinter.

47:39.760 --> 47:41.360
And then you sit down to find the splinter.

47:41.360 --> 47:43.040
Then you go home because you couldn't find this.

47:43.040 --> 47:44.160
I can't find this fucking thing.

47:44.160 --> 47:44.720
I'm going home.

47:44.720 --> 47:48.320
Okay, here's a good one from riddles.com.

47:50.240 --> 47:52.720
You don't see me unless you heat me.

47:53.360 --> 47:56.080
You don't smell me unless you make me.

47:56.720 --> 47:59.840
You don't know I'm here until it's too late.

47:59.840 --> 48:03.920
I have seen countless generations and like parchment always magnifies my presence.

48:03.920 --> 48:04.480
What am I?

48:10.320 --> 48:10.720
What?

48:10.720 --> 48:15.280
It's just like they were trying to write something and they got halfway through and they're like,

48:15.280 --> 48:16.880
this is fucking nothing.

48:16.880 --> 48:18.640
I just want this riddle to be over with.

48:20.640 --> 48:21.760
I'm gonna read it again.

48:25.200 --> 48:27.440
You don't see me unless you heat me.

48:27.440 --> 48:29.840
You don't smell me unless you make me.

48:29.840 --> 48:32.640
You don't know I'm here until it's too late.

48:32.640 --> 48:36.800
I have seen countless generations and like parchment always magnifies my presence.

48:36.800 --> 48:37.360
What am I?

48:39.280 --> 48:40.480
I don't know.

48:40.480 --> 48:43.920
It's invisible ink, but like, what the fuck?

48:43.920 --> 48:44.960
Wait, that's it?

48:44.960 --> 48:48.000
It's just invisible ink is the thing on this one.

48:49.040 --> 48:50.720
What the actual shit?

48:51.440 --> 48:52.400
I, okay.

48:52.400 --> 48:56.000
I love this one because I, I'll just read it.

48:56.000 --> 48:57.600
I run, it runs.

48:57.600 --> 48:59.200
I stop, it runs.

48:59.200 --> 48:59.920
What it it?

49:05.200 --> 49:09.680
This is, I'm imagining like a wizard sitting on top of a mountain and I've climbed the mountain

49:09.680 --> 49:13.920
and I've come to get his orb because it's the only thing that will heal my wife.

49:13.920 --> 49:17.600
And I fought many sort of, uh, you know, skeletons along the way,

49:17.600 --> 49:20.240
but I've made it finally to the top of the wizard's mountain.

49:20.240 --> 49:22.880
And then he says, I run, it runs.

49:22.880 --> 49:24.640
I stop, it runs.

49:24.640 --> 49:25.680
What it it?

49:25.680 --> 49:26.400
Ah, fuck.

49:26.400 --> 49:27.360
I fucked it up.

49:27.360 --> 49:30.960
Man, you came a long way from my orb and I fucked up the riddle.

49:30.960 --> 49:31.840
Just take the orb.

49:35.200 --> 49:35.920
What it it?

49:37.280 --> 49:38.240
Um, a car?

49:38.240 --> 49:39.200
A car?

49:39.200 --> 49:39.520
Nope.

49:40.560 --> 49:41.120
My heart?

49:41.920 --> 49:42.320
Nope.

49:42.320 --> 49:42.640
Okay.

49:42.640 --> 49:45.040
Let me, I'll, I'll, I want to read them all together.

49:45.040 --> 49:47.840
I'll read you the clues to the answer.

49:47.840 --> 49:49.360
I run, it runs.

49:49.360 --> 49:50.720
I stop, it runs.

49:51.280 --> 49:52.080
My watch.

49:53.200 --> 49:53.840
My watch.

49:54.400 --> 49:55.520
My watch.

49:55.520 --> 49:56.080
All right.

49:56.080 --> 50:00.720
I think the rule of fives is, has carried us to the end of the riddle segment.

50:00.720 --> 50:03.440
Hey, this is the end of, uh, riddle me piss.

50:04.080 --> 50:07.600
I did just want to say real quick before we go.

50:07.600 --> 50:10.640
What is the best thing about Switzerland?

50:10.640 --> 50:11.040
Okay.

50:12.240 --> 50:14.640
What's the best thing about Switzerland?

50:14.640 --> 50:15.120
I don't know.

50:15.120 --> 50:15.840
What?

50:15.840 --> 50:17.360
Hey, it's a riddle.

50:17.360 --> 50:20.960
What's the best thing about Switzerland?

50:20.960 --> 50:21.600
Chocolate.

50:21.600 --> 50:23.200
The mountains are beautiful.

50:23.200 --> 50:25.120
Um, there's skiing.

50:25.120 --> 50:27.040
There's a lot of alpine sort of activities.

50:27.840 --> 50:30.560
Um, I don't know, but the flag's a big plus.

50:31.120 --> 50:32.560
Wait, is that on riddles.com?

50:32.560 --> 50:33.840
That's for riddles.com.

50:33.840 --> 50:37.360
And it's actually, it's actually just a joke.

50:37.360 --> 50:38.720
So it's not technically a riddle.

50:38.720 --> 50:40.080
So they still fucked it up.

50:40.080 --> 50:40.640
Should we do it?

50:40.640 --> 50:42.560
We've done one question and one Yahoo.

50:42.560 --> 50:43.600
And that doesn't seem great.

50:43.600 --> 50:44.320
Eight riddles.

50:44.320 --> 50:46.240
Cause this show loves riddles now.

50:46.240 --> 50:48.800
We're a riddle podcast now.

50:48.800 --> 50:50.320
This is a riddle podcast.

50:50.320 --> 50:52.400
It's a riddle podcast for riddlers.

50:52.400 --> 50:54.800
The only fun thing on earth is riddles.

50:54.800 --> 50:56.400
And I love riddles.

50:56.400 --> 50:57.280
I have a good Yahoo.

50:57.280 --> 50:58.720
Y'all want to hear it real quick?

50:58.720 --> 50:59.600
Sure, yeah.

50:59.600 --> 51:01.600
This is sent in by Emily Mercurio.

51:01.600 --> 51:02.000
Thank you.

51:02.560 --> 51:05.280
It's, uh, from a Yahoo answers user.

51:05.280 --> 51:06.240
Raven Hill asks,

51:06.240 --> 51:09.760
How to get over losing important JPEG pictures on your PC.

51:10.640 --> 51:15.200
Years ago I had some really cool pictures I got from some website in 2012.

51:15.200 --> 51:20.080
I can't remember if the pictures were on my Windows 7 laptop or my Windows 7 desktop PC

51:20.080 --> 51:23.760
or even my old Windows XP desktop which crashed and broke.

51:23.760 --> 51:26.400
But I've checked my laptop and Windows 7 PC

51:26.400 --> 51:29.360
and these cool pictures of demons are not on either.

51:29.360 --> 51:33.040
I'm not sure what happened to the pictures because I have so many files and pictures.

51:33.040 --> 51:35.360
But I put it down that they are likely lost forever.

51:35.360 --> 51:38.320
I can't remember what website I got the pictures from either.

51:38.320 --> 51:40.240
And the website's probably not around now.

51:40.240 --> 51:41.280
How do I get over this?

51:41.280 --> 51:43.120
I love art and pictures from the net.

51:46.080 --> 51:47.120
Okay, one more time.

51:47.120 --> 51:48.720
I'm not going to read all that again, Juice.

51:48.720 --> 51:51.360
But the pictures that I had on my PCs,

51:53.200 --> 51:56.560
there were some cool pictures of demons that I downloaded from the net.

51:56.560 --> 51:59.840
And I don't know where those went.

51:59.840 --> 52:01.440
I had some cool demon pictures.

52:01.440 --> 52:04.480
I had a bunch of very, very cool skeleton pictures with guns.

52:04.480 --> 52:09.280
And then I had a few pictures of some of my favorite Matrix characters.

52:09.280 --> 52:11.280
And they're not on the my PC anymore.

52:11.280 --> 52:13.120
And I don't even remember where I got them off the net.

52:13.120 --> 52:14.160
So how do I…

52:14.160 --> 52:18.000
I feel bad for this person because you could come onto my PC

52:18.000 --> 52:23.840
and delete like 23 to 27 of my pictures of Matrix characters.

52:23.840 --> 52:28.000
And I wouldn't even notice because I have so many saved.

52:28.000 --> 52:34.560
All right, my friend Dylan has a 56k and he downloaded it all for me for about $4.

52:34.560 --> 52:35.600
You can put him on a desk.

52:36.160 --> 52:40.960
What I do is I'll save like Neo and then also like Neo 1, Neo 2.

52:40.960 --> 52:44.240
And just save the same JPEG a couple times just in case.

52:44.240 --> 52:44.960
You got to.

52:44.960 --> 52:46.560
You have some backups in there.

52:46.560 --> 52:48.880
So it's like just try to delete all of my Neos.

52:48.880 --> 52:52.320
You won't even find them because some of them I named Morpheus.

52:52.320 --> 52:56.560
So I have a cloud account that I upload most of my Matrix stuff to.

52:56.560 --> 53:00.800
And I feel guilty about that because it feels kind of counter

53:00.800 --> 53:04.320
to what the Matrix guys were all about.

53:04.320 --> 53:04.640
Yes.

53:05.600 --> 53:07.040
You mean all the Matrix characters?

53:07.040 --> 53:10.080
Like if Morpheus found out you did this, Morpheus would be like, oh.

53:10.080 --> 53:12.240
Yeah, I put pictures of him on the cloud.

53:12.240 --> 53:14.880
It's like if I was in the Matrix and I, you know,

53:14.880 --> 53:18.960
was on the cool sewer ships that they were on because I got real,

53:18.960 --> 53:20.960
I would be like, I hate the cloud.

53:20.960 --> 53:21.760
Yeah.

53:21.760 --> 53:22.080
Yeah.

53:22.080 --> 53:26.560
Yeah, so I have that and then I have one just to be safe,

53:26.560 --> 53:28.640
like a flash drive, but it's a big one.

53:29.360 --> 53:31.200
It's like 300 megabytes or something.

53:31.200 --> 53:35.440
And it's full of like JPEGs I downloaded off the internet in the early 2000s.

53:35.440 --> 53:41.600
And I put that in a sort of Faraday cage in my garage just in case,

53:41.600 --> 53:45.040
like if there is the big one, then the pictures will,

53:45.040 --> 53:47.920
I could still look at them on, ah, shoot.

53:48.880 --> 53:50.480
I'm not going to be able to look at them on my computers

53:50.480 --> 53:52.480
because it's going to get, you know, fried up by the big one.

53:52.480 --> 53:56.000
But the good news about the big one is it's going to kill all the AI.

53:56.000 --> 53:56.800
Yeah.

53:56.800 --> 54:02.720
Can you imagine anything that would make you happier than being at your local library

54:02.720 --> 54:07.280
and seeing someone sitting at a computer scrolling through the Google image search results

54:07.280 --> 54:11.360
for cool pictures from the Matrix and just like, yep, good one.

54:11.360 --> 54:12.800
You're coming home with me.

54:12.800 --> 54:15.360
How much is it to print each one out?

54:15.920 --> 54:16.960
Yeah, that's fine.

54:16.960 --> 54:17.520
Yeah.

54:17.520 --> 54:18.400
Ten cents?

54:18.400 --> 54:18.880
Okay.

54:18.880 --> 54:20.880
Just hand them a credit card and like keep it running.

54:21.520 --> 54:22.320
I'm going to be-

54:22.320 --> 54:23.360
Open a tab.

54:23.360 --> 54:24.000
Open a tab.

54:24.000 --> 54:28.080
We're going to be printing out a lot of these bad boys.

54:29.600 --> 54:30.800
Do you have three hole punch?

54:32.080 --> 54:32.960
Thank you.

54:32.960 --> 54:34.000
Can you keep a secret?

54:35.600 --> 54:37.920
Don't tell anybody how many of these I'm about to print out

54:37.920 --> 54:41.040
because it's going to be absolutely ludicrous.

54:41.040 --> 54:50.640
If work gets out, I'll never be able to show my face in city council again.

54:50.640 --> 54:51.520
Just frame them.

54:52.160 --> 54:52.960
Just frame them.

54:55.120 --> 54:57.760
Yeah, it was a two for one at Michael's.

54:57.760 --> 54:59.360
I just had them all taken care of.

54:59.360 --> 55:01.200
This one's kind of my pride and joy.

55:03.040 --> 55:08.720
They've cut the pictures in the shape of the letters M-A-T-T-R-I-X

55:08.720 --> 55:10.400
and they've cut the photos out like that.

55:10.400 --> 55:13.360
And I did have a talk with them about the spelling thing

55:13.360 --> 55:15.760
because that is hugely embarrassing for me.

55:15.760 --> 55:20.720
I can't even have my nephews over because they make such terrible fun of me

55:20.720 --> 55:24.800
for my misspelled matrix collage.

55:24.800 --> 55:26.080
But I do want to-

55:26.080 --> 55:27.520
I want them to be proud of me.

55:28.080 --> 55:29.680
I want to be proud of their uncle.

55:29.680 --> 55:31.520
But I'm so embarrassed.

55:31.520 --> 55:34.320
But not so embarrassed that I won't display it in my home

55:34.320 --> 55:35.680
because it is a treasure.

55:35.680 --> 55:38.480
I did pay to have those printed out at the library.

55:38.480 --> 55:41.280
So I'm thinking of turning my- changing my name to Matt

55:41.280 --> 55:43.200
just so it makes a little more sense.

55:43.200 --> 55:43.600
Right.

55:43.600 --> 55:44.880
Then people will at least be like,

55:44.880 --> 55:47.280
oh, it's a thing, but you didn't used to be Matt.

55:47.280 --> 55:49.360
And I'll say, or maybe it's a glitch in the matrix.

55:49.360 --> 55:49.840
Matrix.

55:49.840 --> 55:51.280
And we'll all have a good laugh.

55:51.280 --> 55:55.920
Anyways, that's why I didn't see that parking meter and I didn't pay it.

55:55.920 --> 56:01.680
Please, please cancel this ticket or whatever you need to do.

56:01.680 --> 56:03.840
I know I haven't seen the Matrix movies.

56:03.840 --> 56:09.120
At this point, I feel like I have though.

56:09.120 --> 56:10.400
You understand your honor?

56:10.400 --> 56:14.240
I got a lot of collectible stuff from like McDonald's and such.

56:14.240 --> 56:16.720
And at this point, I'm pretty much pieced it together.

56:18.480 --> 56:20.000
Quick side story.

56:20.000 --> 56:24.000
When I was in seventh grade, I was in our middle school library

56:24.000 --> 56:25.760
where I did spend most of my lunches.

56:26.320 --> 56:28.960
And the story is not going to be sad the whole way through,

56:28.960 --> 56:30.720
but just sort of during this part of it.

56:31.600 --> 56:32.000
You know what?

56:32.000 --> 56:34.400
It might be sad the whole way through depending on how you look at it.

56:34.400 --> 56:40.880
But I did print out a GameFAQs walkthrough for Pokemon Gold and Silver.

56:40.880 --> 56:46.720
And I didn't realize when I did that, that it was going to be about 290 pages long.

56:46.720 --> 56:50.640
Holy shit, this is going to need such strength.

56:50.640 --> 56:52.640
I got in a lot of trouble.

56:52.640 --> 56:56.480
And I was sort of a volunteer at the middle school library.

56:56.480 --> 56:59.120
And I was not invited back the following year

56:59.120 --> 57:02.320
because I did get a stern talking to…

57:02.320 --> 57:06.880
Because this is not a good heist because it was a dot matrix printer.

57:06.880 --> 57:08.800
Oh god, it's just that grueling noise.

57:08.800 --> 57:10.400
So that was like two days?

57:10.400 --> 57:12.160
Yeah, it was a good long time.

57:12.160 --> 57:13.760
I did not get the full print going.

57:13.760 --> 57:16.720
I think I got about 60 pages in before the librarian came over like,

57:16.720 --> 57:18.400
you've been printing for a long…

57:18.400 --> 57:19.600
What's a Cubone?

57:19.600 --> 57:23.040
And I was like, oh, here I go.

57:23.040 --> 57:24.240
Folks, that's going to do it for us.

57:24.240 --> 57:26.960
Thank you so much for listening to our podcast.

57:26.960 --> 57:30.800
Trav, did you have some things you want to talk about real quick?

57:30.800 --> 57:33.760
I know the big one, the big thing.

57:33.760 --> 57:35.120
Let's start with that.

57:35.120 --> 57:37.840
So a lot of announcements, but all of these,

57:37.840 --> 57:40.960
at least all of like the dates of appearances and stuff,

57:40.960 --> 57:44.160
that's all going to be on mcroyshows.com slash tours.

57:44.160 --> 57:45.440
So I want to move through it pretty quick.

57:45.440 --> 57:49.680
But the big announcement is at the end of September, September 26th to the 28th,

57:49.680 --> 57:53.600
we are coming to Seattle and Portland on September 26th.

57:53.600 --> 57:58.000
We're coming to Seattle with my brother, my brother and me, September 27th.

57:58.000 --> 58:00.960
It's the Adventure Zone, both of those at the Paramount Theater.

58:00.960 --> 58:06.160
And then on September 28th, we're going to be in Portland at the Schnitzer Concert Hall

58:06.160 --> 58:07.760
with my brother, my brother and me.

58:07.760 --> 58:11.680
Those are going on sale this Friday at 10 a.m. local time.

58:11.680 --> 58:18.000
So it'll be 10 a.m. local to Seattle and Portland on sale Friday the 17th at 10 a.m.

58:18.000 --> 58:19.040
Pacific, it's Pacific time.

58:19.040 --> 58:20.720
Yeah, Pacific time, 10 a.m. Pacific.

58:20.720 --> 58:22.000
I'm just reading the thing.

58:22.000 --> 58:24.240
So you'll have some time to get ready.

58:25.120 --> 58:29.040
So we have a couple days, but this Friday, 10 a.m. Pacific.

58:30.320 --> 58:32.320
Now I'm going to run through these really quick.

58:32.320 --> 58:37.840
So dad and I are going to be in Leicington, Kentucky this Saturday the 18th at 2 p.m.

58:37.840 --> 58:41.840
at Joseph Beth Booksellers to sign copies of the Adventure Zone graphic novel.

58:41.840 --> 58:45.760
That'll be the day after my vasectomy, so make sure to ask both of them how it went.

58:46.320 --> 58:49.760
We are doing the tour at the end of the month in Orlando in August.

58:49.760 --> 58:53.360
All right, sorry, Orlando and Atlanta, so make sure you send in your questions.

58:54.160 --> 58:56.960
And then while I'm there, I'm going to be doing some stuff at Dragon Con.

58:57.520 --> 59:02.320
I've already announced the photo sessions, and I'm also doing some other stuff that we haven't

59:02.320 --> 59:04.160
nailed down yet, but I'll be at Dragon Con.

59:04.880 --> 59:09.120

I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song,

01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:04.880
It's a Departure, off the album Putting the Days to Bed.

01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:08.800
It's such a good album, and I really like it a lot.

01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:10.960
And all the Long Winters albums are really dope,

01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:13.360
but this is the only one that has our theme song on it.

01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:15.440
