00:00.000 --> 00:04.820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

00:05.760 --> 00:10.580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

00:11.480 --> 00:17.660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

00:17.660 --> 00:30.660
What's up, you cool, baby?

00:48.660 --> 00:50.660
It's better, it's better with you

00:53.980 --> 00:55.980
It's better, it's better with you

01:00.260 --> 01:02.260
It's better, it's better with you

01:11.580 --> 01:16.620
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother my brother made it my show for the modern era

01:16.620 --> 01:18.620
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy

01:19.300 --> 01:21.300
I'm your middle-aged brother

01:28.260 --> 01:30.740
Yes, it's true I have a pretty new kitty

01:31.740 --> 01:37.300
Is Olive or Olivia? Hello? I'm a pretty kitty. No, look at that special cat

01:37.300 --> 01:44.220
Is that her real name Justin cuz we were told a different name yesterday. Well, she came home and her name was Olive and then

01:44.220 --> 01:49.220
The girls decided Grizabella, you know the glamour cat, of course

01:49.220 --> 01:55.580
Yeah, the cat from the hit movie that we all love that I love you love we all love. Yeah, it's in our blood and

01:56.460 --> 01:59.500
Then I Sidney and I decided we're gonna keep calling her Olive

02:00.500 --> 02:02.720
Protests which you usually don't do

02:03.380 --> 02:07.700
To your kid. You don't usually do a protest. Well, it was gonna be an evening name. I

02:07.700 --> 02:13.220
I see. After the kids were asleep. Oh, yeah. Oh, I thought you're saying the inverse

02:13.220 --> 02:15.940
I thought you were saying in the evening time when the Jellicle cats

02:16.820 --> 02:20.620
Historically do come out and prance. That is when she becomes Grizabella

02:20.620 --> 02:23.940
Well, we I think we can agree that the only confusing thing about cats is

02:24.620 --> 02:27.700
What is a Jellicle name? What's the human given name?

02:28.020 --> 02:32.420
What is their chosen name right cuz it's three different one fucking kitty

02:32.420 --> 02:36.860
Look at those little Toby because you can't tell me that like Jenny Annie dots

02:36.860 --> 02:43.340
Is the same as like rumple teaser? Those are two different worlds at those names existent

02:43.820 --> 02:47.860
Yeah, they can't look at that kitty. Is she changing color to match your shirt?

02:47.860 --> 02:51.940
Is she a community wild if I had a chameleon kitty? She's so little

02:54.780 --> 02:59.940
She's so little we record this show on video now and that's what happens is the cat comes hangs out sometimes

02:59.940 --> 03:02.540
I guess I was sitting on your shoulder like a pretty little parrot

03:02.540 --> 03:08.260
I guess sweet pair on feeble and she likes you which is nice. She's a nice change of paces to my other cat

03:08.260 --> 03:09.980
Does she like me?

03:09.980 --> 03:14.740
Like you let's say ask her. Hi, pretty. Oh, she loves Griffin

03:19.260 --> 03:21.260
Beauty blogging me dad

03:22.460 --> 03:27.100
All right, you got a beauty blog that kitty you're dismissed. Oh, it's gonna stay here on my lap

03:27.100 --> 03:30.700
I guess yeah

03:33.700 --> 03:35.700
Mr. Biggles oh

03:35.740 --> 03:37.740
Yeah, do some

03:38.860 --> 03:45.140
Mr. Biggles were no, mr. Bigglesworth. Oh, man. I shouldn't name how many bad cats how many bad?

03:45.540 --> 03:50.620
Mystery like cats that were not not well-loved. Do you think we're named? Mr. Bigglesworth?

03:50.620 --> 03:58.820
I just I you know right until this moment when you say how many bad cats or whatever and it made me think

03:59.060 --> 04:04.700
What if like mr. Bigglesworth or like that cat that Blofeld's was always hanging out with what if they were really nice?

04:04.820 --> 04:07.860
What if those cats were like no don't hurt them. Oh

04:09.300 --> 04:11.300
Couple of beauty babies like

04:12.780 --> 04:17.660
Justin you went away. Yeah, it was distracting to everyone and we can't do our podcast

04:17.660 --> 04:23.740
I want the kitty on the show instead of Justin there. I said it. I want three kitties on the show instead. Oh my god

04:23.740 --> 04:25.580
Are you kidding me?

04:25.580 --> 04:31.300
Not like my brother my brother me, but now that it's silence with occasional purse. It's good. It's a good show

04:31.300 --> 04:38.980
Have you played that weird mod of stray where it's just three brother kitties and instead of exploring like a city much

04:38.980 --> 04:44.140
Yeah, they're just recording a podcast. I love it. I don't reference turbo teen as much but

04:44.140 --> 04:50.140
Yeah, okay, cuz it's three pretty kitty boys. They talk about mice a lot more. Yeah

04:50.660 --> 04:56.860
All right. Well, I feel like all the oxygen got sucked out of the room the moment the cattle. Yeah, definitely

04:57.460 --> 04:59.460
We should just call this episode

04:59.980 --> 05:03.980
This is this this is um, this is actually perfect. Oh

05:04.420 --> 05:06.500
Okay, this is actually perfect like

05:07.180 --> 05:13.020
Connection here because I am desperate to talk to you guys about a podcast called Hank the cowdog

05:13.020 --> 05:16.780
Now I don't know this. Okay, good. That's perfect. Actually

05:17.860 --> 05:20.020
So I was listening to blank check. They were talking about

05:20.700 --> 05:22.500
I don't know how they got on to it

05:22.500 --> 05:24.780
but they started talking about Hank the cowdog and

05:25.300 --> 05:29.660
they had just discovered its existence and then I in turn discovered it through their discovery and

05:30.300 --> 05:33.820
I just want to tell you guys about Hank the cowdog. Okay, cool

05:34.300 --> 05:40.060
Okay, the self is it funny or is this like are we getting really pop culture happy? I want to talk to you about the cast

05:40.060 --> 05:47.700
Okay, okay. Does it include a dog it stars Matthew McConaughey as Hank the cowdog

05:48.100 --> 05:55.300
Okay, good start good start, right? It also include it's written and directed by Jeff Nichols

05:56.500 --> 05:58.720
And executive producer by Jeff Nichols

06:00.380 --> 06:06.100
Is Hank who also McConaughey served an executive producer Justin I hate to stop you real quick

06:06.100 --> 06:08.100
But I think there's been some confusion

06:08.100 --> 06:09.060
um

06:09.060 --> 06:14.880
You said podcast but clearly this can't be a podcast because it like has won a celebrity in it

06:14.880 --> 06:16.880
And then till you said it's written

06:17.180 --> 06:20.420
And directly, I think you're not actually supposed to write them

06:20.420 --> 06:24.260
I think you're talking about like a movie or maybe a TV show or like a radio drama

06:24.260 --> 06:30.540
Okay, so Jeff Nichols did direct Matthew McConaughey in mood the movie

06:30.540 --> 06:36.180
Correct, and now they're working together again with Matthew McConaughey as Hank a spiritual successor to mud

06:36.180 --> 06:38.180
I haven't seen it but dogs love mud

06:38.380 --> 06:46.660
Jesse Plemons as drover. Okay, sure Kirsten Dunst as Sally May John R. Erickson as Wallace the buzzard

06:47.020 --> 06:52.820
Michael Shannon as sinister the bobcat Joel Edgerton as rip and

06:53.580 --> 06:55.700
Snort and then you got Leslie

06:56.380 --> 07:00.600
Jordan and Cynthia Riva bringing up the back of this this this

07:00.600 --> 07:07.700
Incredible cast this incredible cast of United for Hank the cowdog a five episode

07:07.920 --> 07:13.000
Event now if you were to tell me when this series was released

07:13.000 --> 07:20.580
I bet with a little bit of thinking you could carbon date it to almost a month. Can I guess? Yeah

07:21.040 --> 07:23.040
I'm going to say

07:23.840 --> 07:25.400
June

07:25.400 --> 07:26.480
2020

07:26.480 --> 07:27.800
Wow

07:27.800 --> 07:29.600
Travis Wow

07:29.600 --> 07:31.600
August of 2020

07:32.120 --> 07:38.480
Little bit in post there had a little bit of post work to do to make Michael Shannon really sound like sinister

07:38.480 --> 07:40.480
You know everyone I was trying

07:40.760 --> 07:48.560
Stop, it does not take much work to make Michael. So I met Michael Shannon for eight seconds at a restaurant

07:49.040 --> 07:51.040
Did you really yeah?

07:51.680 --> 07:57.720
I pissed my pants and somehow he pissed Michael Shannon's pants. It was amazing

07:57.720 --> 08:00.200
I thought he didn't have any food yet

08:00.200 --> 08:02.880
And so I bet he won't mind if I go say hey to Michael Shannon

08:02.880 --> 08:05.960
So I walked up and he looked up at me like we're eating

08:07.840 --> 08:13.200
What are you eating no, he didn't really say that what a pleasure it is to meet you Griffin, yeah

08:13.200 --> 08:19.260
I'm a Hollywood big shot Michael Shannon now, if you'll excuse me, I'm learning my lines for a bobcat role

08:19.800 --> 08:21.800
I'm playing sinister

08:22.400 --> 08:24.400
It's the role of a lifetime

08:24.400 --> 08:29.960
Nothing else is happening. No, not Justin. I'm sorry. I hate this was years before

08:30.720 --> 08:37.160
He played saying he was just preparing for a bobcat role knowing it would walk. He was manifesting

08:37.320 --> 08:39.320
I'm gonna be a bobcat

08:40.200 --> 08:47.760
It's not really what he sounds like. It's weird. They didn't come back to this one after the sort of pandemic

08:48.600 --> 08:50.900
Restrictions were lifted for Hollywood types

08:50.900 --> 08:56.860
Yeah, not a lot of return. I think they just made those five and then kind of

08:57.740 --> 09:02.980
Did it? Well, but podcasting is hard man. Not everybody can put out 600 some episodes

09:02.980 --> 09:05.800
You know what I mean? Like a lot of quitters out there

09:06.380 --> 09:08.260
Apparently it's funny you say that draft

09:08.260 --> 09:10.700
apparently according to an email or received I

09:11.380 --> 09:16.940
Said in episode like 12 or 13 that this would be the final episode

09:16.940 --> 09:18.940
This one

09:20.500 --> 09:27.060
Recording right now six, whatever. I mean what we should have prepared more. I don't I don't think of it. I

09:28.020 --> 09:32.180
Don't think of it as episodes anymore. No, no, it's a conversation. Oh

09:34.380 --> 09:37.620
It's jazz I regret to inform everyone

09:38.620 --> 09:40.620
It's jazz. It's jazz

09:40.740 --> 09:42.740
You've been listening to jazz this whole time

09:42.740 --> 09:48.900
Yes, I've been hearing jazz and it's not the kind of jazz you're enjoying dad likes. Okay

09:49.540 --> 09:51.540
Sorry. Yeah, I got ahead of the

09:51.740 --> 09:53.220
thing

09:53.220 --> 09:59.100
That happens sometimes when we're just when we're just jazzin. Oh, she's just sitting behind my monitor

09:59.100 --> 10:02.660
What a cute little kitty cat. You little stinker. I bet it's warm back there

10:03.340 --> 10:05.500
Should we do advice? Yeah, let's do advice

10:05.500 --> 10:12.380
I'm in the process of moving and I have no chairs to sit on and I eat in my place now and eat it

10:12.700 --> 10:18.300
No place to sit. I got my clauses have weird emphasis like kitty clauses

10:20.860 --> 10:25.840
I'm in the process of moving and I have no chairs to sit on and eat in my place

10:25.860 --> 10:29.620
Okay, I have no chairs to sit on a knee in my place. Now. There we go

10:29.620 --> 10:32.460
I ordered pizza for me and my roommates

10:32.460 --> 10:38.580
That's nice. And then they left to get drinks while I waited now. The delivery driver has given me the large 24-inch

10:38.580 --> 10:43.740
Oh, that's large. That's a big you gotta turn that sideways door feet of saw

10:44.140 --> 10:49.300
That's one foot shy of a Bigfoot. Well, you know, it's a two-feet. It's a two-feet

10:50.060 --> 10:54.900
Diameter, but I'm sure if we could do a little bit of pi r-squared calculation we can figure out

10:55.540 --> 11:01.940
What the what the actual area of the pizza is but yes possible actually you cannot figure out the area of a circle

11:01.940 --> 11:05.340
Ah, damn doesn't matter. I tried if people tried

11:07.260 --> 11:12.940
But that's not the important thing the important thing is the only place to put it and eat is

11:13.500 --> 11:15.500
On the ground in the living room

11:16.060 --> 11:19.860
You don't get some counters. What you don't got kitchen counters

11:20.380 --> 11:25.300
Now the only place to put it and eat is on the ground in the living room

11:25.460 --> 11:27.380
The living room has a huge window

11:27.380 --> 11:32.700
Which he can clearly see me from the driver the driver and he has been sitting

11:33.060 --> 11:38.340
In his car for about three minutes, and I've just been standing with the pizza behind a column

11:38.340 --> 11:41.180
So you won't see me sitting on the floor. That's good

11:44.660 --> 11:46.660
You're doing good alone

11:48.940 --> 11:50.940
You're doing is

11:50.940 --> 11:56.540
Exemplary is this a ridiculous? Should I care this much or just do it? I'm so very hungry again

11:56.540 --> 12:00.740
This is a large and they they have a little calves here a large

12:01.420 --> 12:04.420
24 inch pizza that's from I do think that's important

12:04.540 --> 12:11.020
That is important that it's a lot because if the driver rolls up you're in what sounds like an empty apartment

12:11.460 --> 12:16.900
Like empty bear and it's just you and you ordered a large 24

12:16.900 --> 12:23.060
There is is I'm just gonna say a slightly disturbing imagery that I'm getting for the driver

12:23.060 --> 12:25.060
You need to set up a sort of home alone

12:25.060 --> 12:27.060
shadow play

12:27.940 --> 12:32.500
Situation on the curtains and blinds. I mean you don't have furniture in your house

12:32.500 --> 12:38.320
So I'm gonna assume you don't have a big inflatable clown and a talk boy. You know what happens when you assume

12:40.980 --> 12:46.140
Thank you, I want to say 24-inch is pretty big. Yes. There was a place. I used a Mediterranean place

12:46.140 --> 12:50.940
I got pizza from in Austin and it's called arpeggio grill and they had what they called the giant

12:50.940 --> 12:56.300
30 inch pizza that they had to slice so I think we had some of that when you boys were in town from my

12:56.820 --> 13:01.220
Minor Rachel's wedding correct and it's such a big pizza and they have to have slices

13:01.700 --> 13:08.060
Really thin and it looks like a clown's necktie and they had they had to use slightly angle it to get it through your front

13:08.060 --> 13:11.620
Door if I remember. Yeah, and in my in the trunk of my

13:12.220 --> 13:19.100
Toyota matrix anyway, I think it's speaking of some you boys can see behind me. I have nothing

13:19.100 --> 13:25.660
Yeah, that is a the rules are suspended when you have just moved in a way that you would be

13:27.580 --> 13:30.800
It would be a shame for you to waste that opportunity

13:30.860 --> 13:34.940
This is the time where it's okay for you to sit on floor and eat pizza

13:34.940 --> 13:41.340
Some of my most special memories in the last house that I lived in was just sitting on the floor with my with my fam

13:41.340 --> 13:46.500
My buds. Yeah, and just gobbling down some Pete Harry's burgers on the ground on the ground

13:46.500 --> 13:51.300
It's special because you're connected to the root of it where the where the burger came from

13:51.820 --> 13:53.820
You know how much you'll appreciate

13:54.420 --> 14:00.080
Having table and chair. Oh, I have also used to sit on the floor. You'll say I

14:01.220 --> 14:05.220
Was a delivery driver for Jimmy John's for a while, which I'm sure I've talked about

14:06.780 --> 14:10.820
The driver does not care three minutes feels like a long time, but let me tell you a little secret

14:10.820 --> 14:16.780
He's just for him. That's three minutes where he's not at work. That's all he's thinking about baby

14:16.780 --> 14:18.780
Is that three minutes appeared from his?

14:19.100 --> 14:26.940
The moment that door shuts because there's no way that this is the first time a pizza delivery driver has delivered to someone moving into an

14:26.940 --> 14:33.100
Apartment as Griffin has said it's such a common connection of like help me move. I order pizza. I'll just say it to

14:33.780 --> 14:36.460
Three minutes. Maybe that guy should roll on out

14:36.460 --> 14:43.620
You know see he should roll on out. Maybe three minutes isn't that long three minutes is a lot

14:43.620 --> 14:45.900
imagine someone pulling up outside your house and

14:46.460 --> 14:50.640
There yeah, you notice it that car honey that car's been there for three minutes

14:50.860 --> 14:56.860
That's a weird amount of time to idle outside someone's home. Okay. All right. Here's what I'll give you you are correct

14:56.860 --> 15:00.100
I've never been a pizza delivery driver. Maybe he was like

15:00.100 --> 15:06.220
Noting it in his logbook or something depending on which side of the equation

15:06.220 --> 15:09.860
You're on three minutes is a long time if you're in the house looking out

15:10.140 --> 15:12.180
Three minutes is a long time that they're sitting there

15:12.180 --> 15:17.340
If you're the driver and your friend sends you a great long-form tick-tock and you're like wow watch this for you at the road

15:17.340 --> 15:20.540
I want to be responsible and not watch tick tocks while I drive and they don't let me watch it

15:20.660 --> 15:23.180
Then three minutes is nothing, right?

15:23.180 --> 15:30.140
But I guess that's about how long it takes to pack a bowl of that green stuff, which I bet. Oh, I said not to cat

15:30.140 --> 15:31.940
I had a dilemma yesterday

15:31.940 --> 15:36.020
I want to bounce it off the two of you speaking of cars being in places where they shouldn't be for a long time

15:36.180 --> 15:42.580
Lightning McQueen shut up wanted to fight you. He wanted to fight me for the love of my wife. Whoa, not again

15:44.660 --> 15:49.460
Someone left a car in our driveway in the morning and at first I was like, oh, that's weird

15:49.460 --> 15:55.100
Someone parked in our driveway like who who does that? So one it's a one-spot DC driveways

15:55.100 --> 15:59.020
That we and we don't have permits to park on the street is very inconvenient

15:59.020 --> 16:02.260
And so I was like, I bet they'll move it a couple hours later still there. I was like, that's weird

16:02.600 --> 16:06.380
Anyway, I'm gonna check the mail open up the mailbox the keys to the car were in the mailbox

16:06.700 --> 16:12.100
Why someone had someone had delivered an automobile into my possession?

16:13.380 --> 16:17.740
Incorrectly, and there was no information on whose actual car it was

16:17.740 --> 16:22.960
Where I belong how to get how to how to do it how to how to do the thing

16:25.180 --> 16:28.460
Push it in the street street and just leave it all the police

16:30.780 --> 16:34.860
I had to move it so that I could park in our driveway so we wouldn't get a ticket

16:35.260 --> 16:39.660
You got into this and listen, so I got in you got your fingerprints

16:40.220 --> 16:47.380
Let's go it is stole a car. Yeah, did do a grand theft auto for like so you fell for the bait car

16:47.380 --> 16:50.620
You got your fingerprints all over it. Yes

16:51.860 --> 16:54.980
Griffin my innocent boy my young my young

16:55.820 --> 16:56.700
naive

16:56.700 --> 17:02.060
gentlemen your assumption that someone incorrectly delivered that car and not dropped like

17:02.300 --> 17:07.020
What could be a like murder clue into your driveway?

17:08.300 --> 17:15.500
And they're like, this is Griffin's problem now. Yeah, and and then what did you do? Oh

17:15.500 --> 17:21.500
I I moved it out into the street and I left it there for a while and still nobody came to get it

17:21.500 --> 17:24.940
So I went door-to-door and fortunately like on the third house I went to

17:25.380 --> 17:30.520
But those first two houses you didn't drive it, right? I I did have to say I was like, yeah

17:30.520 --> 17:33.960
So it's nice to meet you. Yeah, we're just across the street. I drove your car. So we'll see

17:35.060 --> 17:38.160
No, it's Christine. You can't drive it

17:40.540 --> 17:42.060
Yeah

17:42.060 --> 17:46.500
Hey, can I do can I do a wizard? Oh, I'd love that Griff. I'd love yeah do a wizard on us

17:52.660 --> 17:56.180
Stefan sent this in it's how to not get creeped out by a chain letter

17:56.180 --> 18:02.060
Oh cool from school or work you take off your shoes turn on the TV and check your email you look around and see a message

18:02.060 --> 18:05.900
You read it and you realize it's a piece of chain mail with a threat. Wait, hold on

18:05.900 --> 18:10.420
Can I jump back real quick the series of events there turn on your TV and check your email?

18:10.420 --> 18:16.620
There's a disconnect there and then you look around and see a message like what?

18:16.700 --> 18:24.140
Where's the information coming from in this scenario the TV the air around you? Yeah, I'm scared shitless right now

18:24.140 --> 18:29.220
So if we could just power through this if you don't forward it to ten people, you'll get a frightening consequence

18:29.400 --> 18:35.580
What do you do what to do this how to explains how to deal with this also works on comments such as sites as YouTube

18:36.100 --> 18:40.300
Okay. Yeah, sometimes I am just trying to you know ASMR myself

18:40.300 --> 18:45.100
into the sweet oblivion of sleep and I'll be scrolling through and it's like if you don't

18:45.740 --> 18:48.460
like this comment 69 times then

18:49.180 --> 18:56.020
Your dad is gonna fall is gonna gravity will reverse for him. Yeah, I'll know you've seen these letters

18:58.900 --> 19:02.060
This is why I hate to spoil it but I assume this comes up

19:02.060 --> 19:07.380
This is why whenever I go to a place like Bed Bath and Beyond or like a Yankee Candle and they're like

19:07.380 --> 19:10.540
Do you want to sign up for like our email newsletter? I say yes

19:10.540 --> 19:17.540
and then I when they email me I write down that email address and I just keep ten of those right next to me ready to

19:17.540 --> 19:22.740
Go shotgun. So awesome. So when you get one, that's like your gravity gravity's gonna reverse

19:22.740 --> 19:26.940
Yeah, dad, he'll fall up into space. If you don't send this to ten people you'd be like, what's up?

19:26.940 --> 19:32.740
Bed Bath Beyond what's up Yankee Candle? All I'm saying is I heard circuit city didn't forward it to ten people

19:33.500 --> 19:34.980
Look at him now

19:34.980 --> 19:40.420
Yeah, did you guys um, do you all when you're at the the store and you're checking out?

19:40.420 --> 19:46.980
They're like, um, just need your email address and your phone number. Have you guys ever made up fake ones to avoid?

19:47.500 --> 19:50.220
Having to say I'd rather not give you my email address

19:51.260 --> 19:53.260
Absolutely. I have no I'm

19:53.940 --> 19:57.080
Devin's not getting paid enough. You don't think Devon you don't think Devon would like that too

19:57.080 --> 20:02.380
No, not I'm the eighth person to say been stinky cheeks at Gumi on that biz that day

20:02.380 --> 20:06.100
He g69 we could not secure stinky cheeks at goo mail. Yeah

20:06.100 --> 20:11.060
Well, I had to put an underscore and just to be quick real quick. Yeah, you guys think

20:11.700 --> 20:19.020
Yes, think goo mail.biz is available right for sure, right? Hey, so yeah. Yeah, that's gonna hurt our brand

20:19.020 --> 20:21.420
I think in the long run you think goo mail.biz

20:21.420 --> 20:27.340
I don't think so juice snatched that up for me. I'll pay you back. Sometimes the without biz can get a little pricey

20:27.340 --> 20:29.340
Let's see how this is doing

20:29.340 --> 20:30.840
goo mail

20:30.840 --> 20:35.380
Good goo mail.biz is taken. I knew it

20:38.180 --> 20:40.180
Fucking

20:41.060 --> 20:43.060
Listening in I could goo mail.me

20:44.220 --> 20:46.420
That means you mail me bro, dude

20:47.580 --> 20:50.900
Shoot me a goo mail. We got goo mail goo mail.fun

20:53.740 --> 20:59.460
Goo mail.me it was it we found it. It's good work. Hello. Oh, you're male at or

20:59.460 --> 21:01.460
We're a regular

21:01.660 --> 21:08.300
Nonprofit, we need to sell goo mail.com or just gift it to our favorite nonprofit and be like, this is this is for you

21:08.300 --> 21:11.740
No, this is yours now. Okay, so let's get into the article

21:11.740 --> 21:16.940
I'm not buying any goo mails if I can't get goo mail.biz. It's like not it's now what about all goo mail.com

21:17.900 --> 21:19.900
get goo mail.com

21:21.260 --> 21:22.980
Get goo mail

21:22.980 --> 21:27.300
Okay. Okay. What it think? What is the chain mail? Is it bbq at my house?

21:27.300 --> 21:30.500
I won't like it if you don't come if it is you're fine

21:30.500 --> 21:35.040
It's not really an alarming thing just a friend who expects you to show up and might be sore at you if you don't if not

21:35.040 --> 21:41.940
Continue on I would say that's an alarming thing. Yeah, someone sent me a message like hey grilling up some some sweet beefy boys

21:41.940 --> 21:44.220
And my house, I won't like it if you don't come

21:44.900 --> 21:49.740
Also, that's not really sorry article a chain real that's called an invitation

21:49.740 --> 21:57.580
If someone is chain mailing invitation says invite ten other people to this. Yeah, that's wild. That's lazy. Also

21:58.220 --> 21:59.740
Don't get drawn into reading it

21:59.740 --> 22:05.580
Usually at the top there is something such as don't read this or stop if there is you should stop and delete it

22:05.580 --> 22:12.460
Good advice in general chain letters often tell you to read or don't read as a ploy playing on your initial curiosity

22:12.460 --> 22:17.500
So you read them they'll eventually hit you with a bunch of bologna designed to push your panic button or use any other emotion you have

22:17.500 --> 22:20.100
Against you for one purpose only to get you spreading it further

22:20.580 --> 22:27.180
So I guess if you get email and it's like read this or don't read this then do the opposite

22:27.860 --> 22:32.720
But here's the problem. I get a lot of emails from my doctor with important like test results

22:32.720 --> 22:37.060
I go like once a week just to get random tests, whatever they got. Yeah, they'll use

22:39.700 --> 22:45.500
Travis here any new tests today? Yeah, we got three new ones. Which one do you want surprise me?

22:45.500 --> 22:47.060
I

22:47.060 --> 22:52.900
Was just this is something I want to talk about. Okay me characters welcome. Yeah, we're doing a scene

22:53.180 --> 22:58.380
Okay, that was a scene of vignette. That was a skit a skit. I want us to get better about skits

22:59.620 --> 23:04.980
Fault to I'm gonna play everybody in my skit and I feel like it's good there

23:04.980 --> 23:08.900
I've been meaning to talk to you guys about this when we're not recording but like this. Yeah. Yeah now do it here

23:08.900 --> 23:15.300
Yeah, this is don't double up on the skit. Let other people have fun with the skin with you, right? Okay

23:15.300 --> 23:17.420
Yeah, you want to try it again? Okay

23:18.740 --> 23:20.740
Fucking whiskey. Yeah

23:21.340 --> 23:26.020
Sorry, honey. Daddy's trying to whistle. I'm sorry that your daddy's a bad whistler

23:28.260 --> 23:31.860
Travis here any new tests today? I've got a gun

23:36.820 --> 23:38.820
I've got a sword gun

23:39.660 --> 23:41.180
Yeah, you win

23:41.180 --> 23:43.180
No, I don't want to be in this kit. Oh

23:43.180 --> 23:45.180
Hey, who's that at your door?

23:45.860 --> 23:49.900
This is my little brother Griffin. He's recording a podcast with me. Hey, what's up?

23:54.940 --> 23:58.100
Yeah, look out he's got a slur gun and he loves tests

23:59.820 --> 24:04.500
This is the this is one of the worst kits we've ever done if I if I may we should stick to one person

24:04.500 --> 24:13.740
So if you get an email that says oh like don't read this or stop then don't read it and do stop

24:14.260 --> 24:20.800
Stay rational and sensible often the email or comment will be some story commonly about some monster or a fictional dead kid attacking people

24:21.780 --> 24:25.700
Don't lose your head and get scared. There's no such thing as monsters Wow or

24:26.780 --> 24:30.020
Dead kids attacking people you've known that since you were small

24:30.020 --> 24:34.860
No chain letter is gonna cause what to want to blip into existence to kill you or anyone else

24:35.060 --> 24:38.260
You know dead people are dead and can't go around attacking you pulling you down

24:38.260 --> 24:40.420
It's some non-existent well or do any of those things

24:43.820 --> 24:49.220
Your dad's ex-boyfriend Daryl is it going to come back to your house? I don't know shit about shit

24:49.220 --> 24:54.060
First of all, I know that up till now that hasn't happened. But also up till now

24:54.060 --> 24:59.180
I've always forwarded every chain letter I've ever got correct. So we've got a chain of chain letters

24:59.180 --> 25:01.300
You don't want to break that chain. Yeah, nice try

25:01.740 --> 25:03.460
Never break the chain

25:03.460 --> 25:07.700
Victorian skeleton boy, but you will never get me to go in that well cuz you're not real

25:07.700 --> 25:13.140
You're not real and the wells not real either. But if it is I did forward the chain letter, so I have nothing

25:13.140 --> 25:15.140
I'm doubled down. Yeah

25:16.820 --> 25:22.060
Understand it's hard when you're a Victorian skeleton boy and you just have like a really cool rock collection inside a well

25:22.060 --> 25:26.460
And you're like come check out these rocks and they're like no, you know, like I'm not I just want it

25:26.460 --> 25:34.020
Oh, you can't have a house when you're a Victorian skeleton in this economy in this economy, especially not

25:35.180 --> 25:39.260
The consequences of not following along with the chain communication do not exist after you read the story

25:39.260 --> 25:42.140
It will say something like if you do not send this to ten people you will die in two days

25:42.140 --> 25:44.140
I assume through some sort of

25:44.840 --> 25:46.840
Victorian well boy

25:49.380 --> 25:52.420
Think will this happen to you will you actually die because you didn't send an email

25:52.420 --> 25:57.540
How is it even possible a made-up story and text and pixels created by some anonymous hoaxer can actually kill you

25:57.660 --> 26:02.700
Well, I don't know. I know if I knew that then I would be the one sending right Gary murder

26:02.700 --> 26:09.580
You can't say you can't say will it happen because there's a whole point is I don't know

26:10.100 --> 26:12.100
Right. I don't know the future. I

26:12.820 --> 26:14.580
don't understand the

26:14.580 --> 26:20.340
What the author of the scary Victorian skeleton boy chain letter email gets out of it unless they're like

26:20.340 --> 26:26.260
Send this to ten people and also here's a link to my bank amp. Yeah, I've got a new I've got this

26:26.260 --> 26:30.100
I've got a really hot new sound I've been working on check that out

26:30.100 --> 26:33.980
Oh the hot new sound will also keep the scary Victorian skeleton. Well boy. Oh, yes

26:33.980 --> 26:35.980
Oh things

26:36.060 --> 26:43.020
Subscribe to smash that like button forward it to ten friends or the skeleton boy is gonna well you really hard

26:43.020 --> 26:49.260
I wish I could be there when this person finds this article like okay Valerie calm down. It's okay

26:49.260 --> 26:51.420
It's just a chain letter. We're gonna get through this

26:52.060 --> 26:54.500
Yeah, just go to Yahoo. Let's go. Yeah

26:55.020 --> 26:57.620
No, this step is fucks me up step five

26:57.620 --> 27:01.700
Don't send it to anyone else doing this stops other people from getting it and passing it on and getting worse

27:02.180 --> 27:04.180
Okay, so you do want me to be?

27:04.740 --> 27:09.200
Drowned in a well, which is which is which is which of the two things is it?

27:09.200 --> 27:13.240
Cuz you're telling me not to be scared of the chain email and in my personal experience

27:13.700 --> 27:16.880
That means giving in to the demands of the chain

27:16.880 --> 27:21.960
I figured it out. I'm gonna solve this whole thing. I'm gonna fix fix chain letters for good

27:22.240 --> 27:27.920
What it's gonna take is 12 brave souls, right? And then it's gonna be a full-time job

27:28.560 --> 27:30.920
But every time you get a chain letter

27:30.920 --> 27:37.720
You're gonna forward it to these same 12 people right and then they're gonna forward it to each other and just as chain letters come

27:37.720 --> 27:42.200
In we're just gonna keep sending it to these same 12 people until eventually we've created

27:42.200 --> 27:49.100
Like an echo chamber for every chain letter until it's just these 12 people bouncing it back and forth to each other

27:49.100 --> 27:50.140
It should be 13

27:50.140 --> 27:52.620
I guess because you need one to send it to 12 others, right?

27:52.620 --> 27:58.500
Right, and we're just gonna bounce it around and contain the energy now god forbid when one of them kicks it. Oh

27:59.020 --> 28:02.160
Boy, this is going to become like a Knights of the Round Table

28:03.020 --> 28:06.980
Thing of like you're gonna have to find somebody to take over but I'm gonna love this, you know, we call it

28:06.980 --> 28:14.460
What the unbroken chain and it's a group of people that just keep passing around they protect all of us

28:14.780 --> 28:17.720
Yes, you know a chain letter toilet that you just flush

28:18.620 --> 28:24.540
That is also the secret society from adventures on graduation, but that's fine. No, but that's how they got started, right?

28:24.540 --> 28:31.060
Oh, okay, great. Great equal. This is a prequel to our pretend podcast. Yeah is different from this podcast

28:31.060 --> 28:37.860
Our very real podcast this one gets fun. Keep the email even if it is absolutely creepy

28:37.860 --> 28:39.720
Keep the email and smash it

28:39.720 --> 28:42.740
Write out all the things wrong with it and make yourself laugh at the utter

28:42.820 --> 28:47.700
Ridiculousness of the story and the threat attached to keeping the message is a good way of stopping a troublesome emailer

28:47.700 --> 28:50.100
You tell someone teacher parent friend don't tell someone

28:51.220 --> 28:58.520
Tell someone teacher parent friend, etc. You have proof of getting this unwanted email teacher teacher check this out, please

28:58.520 --> 29:03.240
I'm going to show this to you. I'm not going to forward it to you. So the curse will not be

29:03.720 --> 29:09.160
activated, but I need you to know that I have been threatened with a well boy and

29:10.480 --> 29:14.920
I think about it, I guess we're getting into semantics though, right?

29:14.920 --> 29:18.920
Because yeah, you're not mechanically forwarding electronically forwarding it

29:18.920 --> 29:25.080
But you are like moving the information in the brain. The digital data is how the curse is transmitted

29:25.080 --> 29:28.840
Okay, see I've never seen the ring for obvious reasons

29:29.000 --> 29:34.760
But I do know that in stories like the ring like there's always that moment of like you heard about it

29:34.760 --> 29:41.640
Check this out. There's no way right and like that idea of I like this thing of don't take it seriously

29:42.400 --> 29:48.200
But don't not take it seriously like just could say at least let the buck stop with you

29:48.880 --> 29:52.080
So that's how to not get creeped out by a chain letter

29:52.080 --> 29:59.860
Confront the sender if the person sends you three or more emails tell someone else you've already told the teacher I guess get

30:00.400 --> 30:01.480
multiple

30:01.480 --> 30:06.640
Just sort of hands. Yeah, tell someone out first you tell the teacher and then the vice principal and then the principal

30:07.360 --> 30:11.220
That's the chain of command. It doesn't go any that's why it's called the chain letter. Yeah

30:11.220 --> 30:14.680
Yeah, you pass that on up the chain to your principal. Yeah. Oh, no

30:14.680 --> 30:21.840
Your vice principal don't take that. Don't hey get this off my desk. I'm the principal of a major middle school

30:21.840 --> 30:25.800
I don't have time for chain letters. Take this to the associate vice-principal

30:25.800 --> 30:32.760
I'm going to have to talk to the superintendent about the letters to me and then I give them to President Joseph Biden

30:34.760 --> 30:40.440
And he for it guys to our nation's greatest enemies and then the well boy hunts down terrorists

30:40.440 --> 30:44.960
I knew from Amazon Prime. Well boy

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
Well, well boy, you're a last hope

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
sending this to Kim Jong

30:51.680 --> 30:55.160
Kim Jong-un well boy you and Dennis Rodman are gonna work together on this

30:56.600 --> 31:02.100
I'm not working with Roman no more. I can't trust him push him in the wheel

31:03.120 --> 31:06.000
Get me Jack. That was Dennis Rodman's voice

Well, I've seen a lot the inside of a lot of wells pal. Once you've once you've pushed

31:28.000 --> 31:30.960

Oh Jesus well boy. Yeah, baby Jessica was a creature of sin and I was trying doing my best like that one part the leftovers

She ended up. Okay, though, right? I don't want to talk about it. Okay adorable and evil

32:08.520 --> 32:13.080
She'll forward every fucking letter. She receives this kid. This is for

32:13.840 --> 32:17.560
Menards flyers that she gets just to be just to be extra careful

32:17.560 --> 32:23.440
Careful, she's not going back to that. Well, that's what I live for. That's why I'm in this business, brother

32:26.120 --> 32:28.680
If I'm gonna give up well for you or anybody

32:30.880 --> 32:33.920
I might try a sister in her to just to see how it goes

32:34.440 --> 32:40.920
Watch the video of macho man Randy Savage on Arsenio Hall and our cinema halls like does the macho man ever cry?

32:40.920 --> 32:48.640

My dingle donger got huge and I got a thousand. I got a hundred dollars. Whoa

35:42.300 --> 35:47.980
In the mail from who I don't know. I don't know. It was an empty. It was an envelope with nothing on it

35:47.980 --> 35:50.500
That was actually from me. I wanted you to invest that I

35:51.340 --> 35:56.460
Got a letter from the Census Bureau. That's like hey, we're doing this thing on a national survey of children's health

35:56.460 --> 36:01.860
Will you fill it out and I was like, uh, I guess so and I looked further in the letter. There's a $5 bill

36:01.860 --> 36:04.700
Inside of it, you know, they were doing that. Thanks census

36:05.540 --> 36:08.060

It's clear, but it's a but these are not these are jokes in Squarespace

36:26.940 --> 36:28.700
I think would be pretty pio'd if we didn't

36:28.700 --> 36:34.660
Say that like when we said that all of your bones would revolt and leave your body if you don't tell everyone you know

36:34.660 --> 36:40.540
About this episode of the podcast in Squarespace, then you put something bad will happen to your bones or God will make your business rich

36:41.460 --> 36:43.460
That probably won't happen

36:43.460 --> 36:52.700
Legally, we have to say that here at the end. Yeah, but it definitely will but wink

36:52.700 --> 36:54.780
Hi everyone, I'm Anna McLeod

36:54.780 --> 37:01.580
And I'm Alexis B Preston and we host a show called comfort creatures the show for every animal lover

37:01.580 --> 37:05.840
Be it a creature of scales six legs fur feathers or fiction

37:06.300 --> 37:12.460
Comfort creatures is a show for people who prefer their friends to have paws instead of hands unless they are raccoon hands

37:12.460 --> 37:16.260
That is okay. That is absolutely. Okay. Yeah. Yes, every Thursday

37:16.260 --> 37:21.180
We will be talking to guests about their pets learning about pets in history art and even fiction

37:21.180 --> 37:26.940
Plus we'll discover differences between pet ownership across the pond. It's gonna be a hoot on maximum fun

37:30.820 --> 37:34.540
Hi everybody, my name is Justin McElroy and I'm Sydney McElroy doctor

37:35.580 --> 37:40.340
That is true. It's important in this context because we host a medical history podcast called

37:40.340 --> 37:48.180
Sawbones. Oh, I thought we were gonna we shouldn't work on that. Sawbones. Sawbones isn't afraid to ask the hard-hitting questions

37:48.300 --> 37:55.860
Like are vaccines as safe and reliable as they want us to believe? Yes. Do I have to get a flu shot?

37:56.260 --> 37:57.420
Yes

37:57.420 --> 37:59.420
Okay, is science a miracle?

37:59.940 --> 38:00.940
No

38:00.940 --> 38:07.320
We have a lot of great history for you and a lot of laughs and sometimes the history is so bad that there's no laughs

38:07.320 --> 38:12.800
But you'll learn something you'll feel something and it's always sawbones. That's right

38:13.600 --> 38:15.600
every week on maximumfun.org

38:18.640 --> 38:21.800
Okay, you're your middle name is macho

38:22.320 --> 38:26.960
But uh, I'm wondering if you ever cry you ever has macho man ever cried. Oh, yeah

38:28.320 --> 38:34.280
It's okay for macho men to show every emotion available right there, you know, because I've cried a thousand times

38:34.280 --> 38:36.280
I'm gonna cry some more but

38:36.280 --> 38:40.680
I've soared with the Eagles and I've slithered with the snakes and I've been everywhere in between

38:41.240 --> 38:47.080
And I'm gonna tell you something right now. There's one guarantee in life and that there are no guarantees. Yeah

38:52.280 --> 38:55.320
Nobody likes a quitter nobody said life was easy

38:55.320 --> 39:01.420
So if you get knocked down take the standing eight count get back up and fight again, and you're a macho maniac

39:01.420 --> 39:06.980
Dig it. There it is. Fuck. I mean, yeah, there it is from the macho man himself

39:07.220 --> 39:13.320
Do you remember when macho man body slam toxic masculinity? Yeah, thank you much. Fuck. Yeah, dude

39:13.780 --> 39:18.600
Remember when all Hogan ever body slam was fucking Richard Belzer. Yeah

39:21.340 --> 39:28.160
All I'm saying is macho man press freedom those two things were body slammed by Hulk Hogan

39:28.160 --> 39:33.900
We've never fully discussed as a society. I think macho man Randy Savage's ability to

39:34.620 --> 39:40.220
Use the two-word phrase. Oh, yeah in so many different ways. Just that like

39:42.620 --> 39:47.460
It's an interrogative it was fucking poetry when he said I love that. Oh, yeah

39:47.460 --> 39:57.540
Yeah, macho man's cried. Yeah much and it's it can be more passive than that macho man. Do you want some blackberry cobbler? Oh, oh, yeah

40:00.540 --> 40:07.380
That when macho man cries the tears don't drip down his face they like come out, okay, they like Gleek

40:10.140 --> 40:12.740
Brother the blast like tear juice

40:12.740 --> 40:19.060
It's very macho. Um, I train and teach at a local Krav Maga gym. Ah

40:20.540 --> 40:24.660
The beautiful dance the art sweet science recently

40:24.660 --> 40:29.720
We had a 78 year old man join our gym and started attending classes and he beat everyone to death. No

40:31.340 --> 40:32.620
Miss read I miss read

40:32.620 --> 40:37.840
He's just told came to one of my classes but ended up leaving after about 20 minutes gotten all he needed to I guess

40:37.940 --> 40:41.920
Just wanted to learn how to punch his mailman in the face and now he's ready to go

40:41.920 --> 40:47.860
No, I don't think that's it. Um the next day at another instructors class. He came up to me and said I

40:49.540 --> 40:54.660
Wrote a poem about your class yesterday. Do you want to see I said, okay

40:55.180 --> 40:58.740
Then he went out to his car, but instead of getting the poem he drove away

41:01.900 --> 41:08.140
We have seen one another at the gym multiple times since then but neither of us have mentioned this poem

41:08.140 --> 41:11.500
Brothers, how can I unlock the old man?

41:11.500 --> 41:16.140
Krav Maga poem that's from Troubled in Tennessee. This can't be

41:16.740 --> 41:20.100
This can't be real, right? I mean this can't be real

41:20.180 --> 41:24.580
Well, you know in I so I I build a question list and in picking this question

41:25.100 --> 41:32.500
Not until this moment that the possibility occurred to me that perhaps in in poem form. It's like a performance art thing

41:32.500 --> 41:39.100
It was a poem. He wrote it's a performance poem. Thank you. Yeah, the performance he wrote is the leaving or he was like

41:39.100 --> 41:44.580
Just what's it mean to you? Like I did a performance art piece about right off Maga and here it is

41:44.580 --> 41:45.860
I'd like to do it for you right now

41:45.860 --> 41:48.220
Also, let me just say it was also good to me

41:48.220 --> 41:53.580
If you are ever in this the old man's position here and you start taking a class and you're like, oh

41:53.580 --> 41:55.580
I don't really want to take this class anymore

41:55.580 --> 42:04.660
It's not just walking out loudly announced like oh wait. I already know this. I know this. I'm punching and kicking. I can do that. Oh Krav Maga. Okay, I'm sorry

42:04.660 --> 42:11.260
I've called it something else. Sorry. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, no I know this. I got it confuses with quilting. Do you think do you think?

42:11.860 --> 42:13.860
Do you think there's a possibility?

42:13.860 --> 42:24.180
That this old man thought he was going to a class for people that crave Maga

42:24.180 --> 42:26.180
Is it possible?

42:26.180 --> 42:28.180
This man is like hell yeah

42:28.180 --> 42:30.180
Hell yeah

42:30.180 --> 42:32.180
If that's the case he made it 20 minutes

42:32.180 --> 42:38.180
So there's like it's coming. It's good. Yeah, okay. He's trying to hang in there like yeah this too

42:38.180 --> 42:46.180
I guess yeah, also this all right. Yeah, I don't think they're gonna get to it. I don't think it's maybe maybe that's a second class

42:46.180 --> 42:52.180
They don't want to let you they don't give it away for free if you're really craving the Maga. Sorry, I misread it

42:52.180 --> 42:54.180
I was craving manga. Sorry. I gotta go

42:58.180 --> 43:02.180
You guys have any any rare one-piece in your collection

43:02.180 --> 43:08.180
You guys have any any rare one-piece issues

43:08.180 --> 43:14.180
I like how you read them backwards

43:14.180 --> 43:22.180
Is it if anyone ever comes up to you and says I have written a poem and then the active verb that they use in the next sentences

43:22.180 --> 43:24.180
Do you want to see it?

43:24.180 --> 43:29.180
That feels weird to me instead of do you want to read it or do you want me to read it to you?

43:29.180 --> 43:36.180
If they go I wrote a poem do you want to see it and then they try to take you to a second location where the poem lives

43:36.180 --> 43:43.180
No, do you think that's what's happening Griffin like the old man went out to his car and then was like surprised like they didn't follow me

43:43.180 --> 43:46.180
Huh, I thought I just assumed they'd come with the poems at home

43:46.180 --> 43:53.180
The poems at home is interesting like if he thought it was in the car, and he's like I'm gonna get that fucking poem

43:53.180 --> 43:59.180
And then he goes out it's like the poems not here and he's like I should go back in and tell him oh, but I'm so embarrassed

43:59.180 --> 44:02.180
That's happened to me with my wallet at a store

44:02.180 --> 44:07.180
I'll just go in and recite as much as I remember no David god damn don't it's so embarrassing

44:07.180 --> 44:14.180
That has happened to me at like a grocery store or something like where I've bought all the groceries up to the front and realized it in my wallet

44:14.180 --> 44:19.180
I said I must have left it out of the car I go out in the car the wallets not there and then there's the question of like

44:19.180 --> 44:23.180
I'm not gonna go back in and say so I drive home. Do I get my wallet?

44:23.180 --> 44:29.180
Do I just say like well, let's scrap it for the day, right? He had a good run didn't quite get there. It happened. This is

44:30.180 --> 44:33.180
This is for me a non-issue. Oh

44:34.180 --> 44:40.180
Because if someone ever came up to me and said I have a poem I wrote about something you did and now I'm gonna do it

44:40.180 --> 44:45.180
To you right now and you you can't oh, it's in the car and then they leave and don't come back

44:45.180 --> 44:50.180
I have just avoided a social interaction that would have

44:51.180 --> 44:56.180
Shaved years off of my life. Yeah, that would be a tricky needle to thread unless it's really good

44:57.180 --> 45:05.180
Unless you think this 20-minute 20-minute observed Krav Maga poem is gonna is on some real Robert Frost shit

45:05.180 --> 45:11.180
What I'm saying is that perhaps the reason that he left your class early is because inspiration struck him

45:11.180 --> 45:19.180
So hard that he had to grasp the reins and hold on tight and it was not up to him when he pursued the muse

45:19.180 --> 45:25.180
but rather the muse pursued him and he had to like follow and write it and and like

45:25.180 --> 45:30.180
It just moved him so much that he had to go write this poem

45:30.180 --> 45:35.180
But he did say he had already written it. Yes. Well, this is our following day

45:35.180 --> 45:41.180
Yeah, but then he went home and he was like they're not ready for this if I give him this poem

45:41.180 --> 45:44.180
It'll change the way that they think about Krav Maga and they're not ready for that

45:44.180 --> 45:51.180
This is a bank error in your favor done very well. You have broken this you've you've somehow bugged out

45:51.180 --> 45:57.180
This NPC interaction that was going to make you very uncomfortable. Yes, and that's dope

45:57.180 --> 46:05.180
I would love the sweet cheat codes that you are rocking my friend so that I can avoid any other stranger poem

46:05.180 --> 46:08.180
Sort of moments that may happen to me in my lifetime

46:08.180 --> 46:14.180
I don't know when that would be perhaps when I'm strolling the streets of Paris at nighttime

46:14.180 --> 46:21.180
With with my lady love and some bohemian type comes up to me at the riverside

46:21.180 --> 46:28.180
And you know, it's like give me five dollars. You know how they do how they do it

46:28.180 --> 46:34.180
You know how the bohemian types are always doing that for five dollars in Paris where they want US currency

46:34.180 --> 46:41.180
This is this is a fundamental difference between Gryphon and I of in Cincinnati

46:41.180 --> 46:45.180
A gentleman has approached me and said for five dollars. I'll do a poem on you. No lie

46:45.180 --> 46:51.180
I said yes, of course. I handed him five dollars now. I do not remember the poem but I remember enjoying it thoroughly and saying

46:51.180 --> 46:58.180
Thank you very much and tipping him an extra five dollars because it was such a wonderful poem and I went on about my day feeling inspired

46:58.180 --> 47:02.180
Well, I mean on the day where I told the poem man that I didn't want the poem

47:02.180 --> 47:04.180
I went on to do a bunch of other really good stuff. Oh

47:05.180 --> 47:12.180
Like what so well, you know, I helped I bought some apples for the school. Yeah like

47:12.180 --> 47:15.180
Yes, what Apple computers? No

47:16.180 --> 47:23.180
Just like the eaten kind enough for everybody. Yeah enough for the whole school. I bought apples for them all

47:23.180 --> 47:26.180
Well, that's a lot of that's a lot of apples dude cost me so much money

47:26.180 --> 47:30.180
And then I did I went to the hospital and helped it like fixed a couple people

47:30.180 --> 47:35.180
Well, you know what? I heard driven a lot of those people ended up in the hospital because someone had bought all the apples and they were having

47:35.180 --> 47:39.180
Apple deficiencies and it made them really sick so they had to go to the hospital

47:39.180 --> 47:43.180
well, you know do something nice for someone and

47:46.180 --> 47:52.180
Yeah, and also I heard given that the people you did fix were serial killers what yeah

47:52.180 --> 47:56.180
Okay, but I did other good stuff that day like what day where I said no to the poem man

47:56.180 --> 48:01.180
Yeah, like what the serial killers and stole all the apples from the rest of the world and gave it to one school

48:01.180 --> 48:08.180
Yeah, which honestly now that I'm thinking back about it was probably good on apples, but I was just feeling really guilty about the poem guy

48:08.180 --> 48:12.180
Yeah, what else did you do that day Griffin? Oh, I bought season

48:13.180 --> 48:17.980
Three of lost. Oh, that was really kind of you. Yeah, and I gave it to the library. Oh

48:20.700 --> 48:25.060
To the library and I was like give these out to kids who want to go on this like

48:25.580 --> 48:31.180
mysterious adventure now with everyone was that the season three box out that was discontinued because it

48:31.660 --> 48:34.820
Spontaneously would combust and like catch fire to whatever building it was in

48:34.820 --> 48:38.500
This is how is a DVD gonna come that's doesn't make you sense

48:39.580 --> 48:43.460
The other stuff we've been saying has been like funny, but like yeah, yeah, like make you think

48:44.420 --> 48:47.180
That's what I like when it like you kind of hmm

48:47.300 --> 48:49.860
Yeah, like when I was like I bought all the apples and you're like

48:49.860 --> 48:54.900
But then there's no apples for other people that's real and that make you think but when you're like the lost DVDs burn up and burn

48:54.900 --> 48:56.940
Your house down that does not make me

48:57.500 --> 49:00.100
How did a DVD you knew that Travis? How would a DVD do?

49:00.100 --> 49:05.300
I caught the light and refracted it in such a way that the house burned down. That's never happened ever

49:12.580 --> 49:19.020
I want a bunch squad squad. Wow guys. Can you give me a little bit fucking more than that?

49:19.020 --> 49:21.620
Please you made a squishy noise in the middle Justin

49:22.180 --> 49:25.940
Just a little bit more than that, please. I don't want to scare the kitty

49:25.940 --> 49:29.340
Hey, she's still there. You don't know

49:31.260 --> 49:33.260
Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh, I want a bunch

49:35.500 --> 49:36.820
I'm loving the beer

49:36.820 --> 49:42.200
But I feel like when you start to bust out butt rock riffs on it it goes it turns on me

49:42.200 --> 49:45.580
Just a little just a little I don't know why okay. I'm a challenging man now

49:45.580 --> 49:50.620
I'm aesthetically more challenging than I was before it takes a refined palette, but those that are into it they get it

49:50.620 --> 49:52.620
You know I mean they get it Ray J

49:52.620 --> 49:54.620
What did he do?

49:54.620 --> 50:00.140
Ray J is helping out Krystal getting back to late night

50:00.140 --> 50:06.380
Krystal is the original slider of the South. It's the South's version of White Castle. You understand?

50:07.460 --> 50:11.060
I've never heard I've literally never heard of this once in my life

50:11.660 --> 50:14.460
Real quick to spotlight all things because I have another thing I want to

50:15.380 --> 50:22.260
Real quick to spotlight all things fun after dark Krystal is partnering with American actor singer and TV personality

50:22.260 --> 50:27.620
Ray J for a series of commercials quote more of our restaurants are staying open later

50:27.940 --> 50:32.100
Striving to meet the Krystal crave as our guests are getting out and enjoying the nightlife

50:32.260 --> 50:35.620
Hey guys having a fun time at the clubs and with the nightlife and everything

50:36.740 --> 50:38.740
hamburgers from

50:38.780 --> 50:40.780
Weird make you feel super big

50:41.660 --> 50:45.660
The next hot spot for us small hamburgers from AJ

50:45.660 --> 50:52.460
It's weird that you would need to do a commercial to advertise keeping your restaurant open late because of high demand

50:53.300 --> 50:55.300
That is an excellent point

50:56.780 --> 50:59.140
The $1.99 Krystal snack is

51:00.540 --> 51:06.740
Is a new option there it's valid at participating restaurants, which they always clarify

51:06.740 --> 51:09.180
But like I feel like if a restaurant is not participating

51:09.180 --> 51:13.780
That's a pretty good sign that you're not gonna walk away with that particular way, but no look what and not only that Krystal

51:13.780 --> 51:19.260
You're in charge to make a participate. Why are you giving your restaurants like I don't want to do that deal

51:19.780 --> 51:21.940
Also, I don't think you can just have

51:22.780 --> 51:25.900
Item on the menu that is name of restaurant snack

51:25.900 --> 51:29.660
I think if I ever went to McDonald's and they're like, do you want McDonald's snack?

51:34.740 --> 51:39.980
Especially when the name of the restaurant is another noun like do you want a Krystal snack?

51:39.980 --> 51:46.300
It sounds like a rock golem with it, right? Absolutely with a side of pebbles. What are you talking about?

51:47.140 --> 51:49.140
Real quick. I just want to mention that Ray J

51:49.620 --> 51:51.140
Actually, this is a quote

51:51.140 --> 51:54.140
Ray J actually reached out to us

51:54.940 --> 51:56.940
Through our head of creative marketing

51:57.300 --> 51:59.860
You guys know the head of creative marketing for Krystal, right?

52:01.660 --> 52:02.860
Two chains

52:02.860 --> 52:08.420
No, it's two chains and he wanted to get involved in spreading the word about Krystal

52:08.420 --> 52:15.740
They're building like an MCU of sponsors. He's like, hi, it's Ray J. I'd like to help get the word out about Krystal

52:15.740 --> 52:22.580
Not a lot of people know this but two chains got his name because he owns two different things in the restaurant chain Krystals

52:23.380 --> 52:25.380
There's two different restaurants

52:25.900 --> 52:27.700
Oh man, that's got to be a humble pot

52:27.700 --> 52:34.100
Two chains one on I-64 and the other one on I-75 stop on by anytime you want to be happy to see you

52:34.100 --> 52:39.380
That's gotta take a little bit of a win at a two chain sales reason. I cannot get this across the finish line on my

52:39.380 --> 52:44.300
Own two chains. I'm I must I must bring him I must assemble the team

52:44.300 --> 52:48.660
I don't have the I don't have the like self-confidence to become three chains

52:49.020 --> 52:54.500
No that point in the beach where there was only two chains. That's when I was carrying you. I'm Ray J

52:54.500 --> 52:58.820
I do want to say not a lot of people know this it's short for Ray Jesus. I

52:58.820 --> 53:04.020
Want to have it don't think so. I want to check in real quick on Carl Laredo

53:04.660 --> 53:12.940
My one of my favorite hype men in the biz worried about Carl Wendy's is adding sweet twists to its breakfast menu

53:12.940 --> 53:16.600
That's right. Homestyle French toast sticks. It's happening

53:16.780 --> 53:22.620
It's a sweet new taste at when at Wendy's but how did they settle on this?

53:22.620 --> 53:30.300
Well, Carl said our homestyle French toast sticks strike a perfect note of nostalgia and bring even more morning flavor to our menu

53:30.300 --> 53:32.900
This time with something sweet from day one

53:32.900 --> 53:39.060
We launched our breakfast offering to save fans from the boring and bland morning options that exists some of our competitors. Yep

53:39.700 --> 53:44.820
We've done just that so you get so caught they were like Carl. I

53:45.300 --> 53:50.500
Love when QSR does this they did an interview. They're like Carl how in the fuck man?

53:50.500 --> 53:55.820
This how did you do this and he said we have a couple options and we really honed in on

53:56.020 --> 54:00.660
French toast as a platform. Yeah, I love when he uses that word

54:00.660 --> 54:06.020
The reason being is that there's there's only certain foods at breakfast time that consumers love

54:06.980 --> 54:14.080
But are really difficult to actually put together. Yes, but also carry a lot of emotional benefits. Oh fuck

54:14.080 --> 54:17.220
Yeah, so we start this program of focusing on nostalgia

54:17.220 --> 54:21.620
We could have done waffles, but you know, unfortunately waffles

54:22.460 --> 54:27.500
There's so many that are out there and yeah, they're really bad

54:28.660 --> 54:34.600
Carl and and it hearkens back to mom or dad pulling out waffles of the freezer

54:35.260 --> 54:37.460
And there's always freezer burn. Yeah

54:39.740 --> 54:41.740
But I'm just reading it

54:41.740 --> 54:47.020
Carl is a fucking artist. He's like the Gene Shepard

54:47.620 --> 54:52.220
Like of our time the story he's creating I am sucked into this

54:52.340 --> 54:57.740
So it hearkens back to mom or dad pulling waffles of the freezer. There's always freezer burn. It wasn't really all that special

54:58.260 --> 55:04.580
Pancakes which are honestly just like dry mix and you mix water and then you throw it in a pan

55:04.740 --> 55:10.060
Take that fucking pancakes. You're on blast Carl Laredo's coming for you

55:10.060 --> 55:14.940
Bullshit fuck. Yeah, fuck that play. Anyway, this is sort of pan

55:14.940 --> 55:17.460
It lacked a little bit the extra love that's needed French toast

55:19.980 --> 55:25.220
Interested so without research we discovered French toast is one of those things that was super special

55:25.580 --> 55:31.780
Hi, I'm a researcher Carl and I've got the report in and turns out French toast is super special

55:31.780 --> 55:39.460
You just swirls a beaker around and the fluid turns from blue to purple and he's like it's special

55:43.860 --> 55:49.740
The French toast molecule collide with the syrup molecule and we did it the God particle

55:52.420 --> 55:56.340
Smell this beaker. Oh, what is that waffles? That's not no

55:56.340 --> 56:02.140
This is conjuring images of freezer burn and just mother and father taking him out of the freezer

56:02.620 --> 56:05.500
It's like my mother and father who I hate

56:06.020 --> 56:08.020
now this

56:08.660 --> 56:13.220
Real quick, what's the key differentiating factor of your French toast eggs from the others?

56:13.900 --> 56:15.900
Carl says it took us a year

56:16.500 --> 56:20.700
It took us a year. We went through 18 different whenever they say that

56:20.700 --> 56:25.180
I always wonder is that like six of the same people rolling up to the office every morning?

56:25.180 --> 56:28.140
They're like, well time to make some more fucking Frankie toast

56:28.860 --> 56:32.140
This is Carl Laredo a French fry visionary

56:32.140 --> 56:39.020
So yes Justin I'm going to say that this was Carl and maybe a team of five that had to rotate out Carl CMO

56:39.020 --> 56:40.660
He's just a hype man. He's not out there

56:40.660 --> 56:46.620
He's not like chef Mike out there like developing recipes like he perhaps you don't remember the fucking poetry that

56:47.020 --> 56:49.020
Carl Laredo laid down about

56:49.020 --> 56:54.260
Wendy's new crispy fries. No, I know he spits words, but he doesn't like fry fries himself

56:54.260 --> 56:56.100
Yeah, you assume

56:56.100 --> 57:01.020
It took us a year. We went through 18 different iterations to get this right

57:01.100 --> 57:03.880
So if I could just do a little bit of math

57:04.860 --> 57:09.660
Real quick, if everyone could just be patient. I'm just pulling up my calculator

57:10.180 --> 57:17.560
Real quick. Nope. That's my cat. Are you dividing 365 by 18? So if real quick if I divide

57:19.020 --> 57:20.860
365 by

57:20.860 --> 57:22.780
18 I get

57:22.780 --> 57:24.780
20 so

57:24.780 --> 57:31.540
They would make it for 20 days every 20 days. They're like, no, no, I quit

57:32.140 --> 57:34.140
Do it again

57:34.580 --> 57:37.380
Get me a new batch of French toast of

57:38.020 --> 57:44.920
Chefs of chefs you're out. We have to make the French toast just like your mom grandma your dad

57:45.500 --> 57:50.840
Whoever it was that made it in your house talking dog the robot Butler, whatever it is

57:50.840 --> 57:52.720
The

57:52.720 --> 57:54.720
big French ghost

57:56.640 --> 57:58.640
The magic oven whatever

58:00.680 --> 58:07.140
Well boy, you're sometimes you just wake up at the French toast is there and you live alone and not sure whatever

58:07.760 --> 58:09.160
candelabra

58:09.160 --> 58:10.560
3d printer

58:10.560 --> 58:15.720
Whoever it doesn't matter the French toast tree you grew outside that everyone said would never work

58:15.720 --> 58:21.640
But look where you got the void gate in the ceiling. We're getting you get it from doesn't matter

58:21.640 --> 58:25.660
So we went through okay. Hey, so we start with Texas toast

58:26.200 --> 58:32.760
It goes through an actual egg and dairy and vanilla sugar mix. It's Royale. It's it's a custard

58:33.800 --> 58:38.160
I'm just reading by the way, if I had this for your eyes. Wow. Okay. Yeah, it's a Royale

58:38.160 --> 58:44.040
It's a custard. We make sure it sits in this Royale for the right amount of time. Notice. He's not saying the right amount

58:44.040 --> 58:46.480
No, it's like that's trade secret

58:46.480 --> 58:49.760
It's got to absorb and then actually go through a griddle process

58:49.760 --> 58:53.960
yeah, because you actually want to get all the caramelization around the French toast to get that

58:55.680 --> 58:58.480
Caramelization color and more importantly

58:59.160 --> 59:00.520
the flavor

59:00.520 --> 59:03.880
Then when we get it to a restaurant

59:04.120 --> 59:09.740
This is just a quick flash fry to get it crispy on the outside and you maintain the custard interior

59:09.740 --> 59:10.840
That's what we want to land on

59:10.840 --> 59:13.800
It took us this long because we didn't want to launch until we got it, right?

59:13.800 --> 59:18.160
Hey, if I could just say Carl fucking great instincts, man. Yeah

59:18.880 --> 59:22.640
You don't want to do a you don't want to do a soft open on this one on some shitty toast

59:23.520 --> 59:28.840
We're at this one's in beta. So just try it and if you don't like it, it's it's fine

59:28.840 --> 59:34.580
We weren't gonna stick with it. Anyway, it's fine. I do want to say it sounds like he did describe how to make French toast

59:35.280 --> 59:37.520
Yes, which I should mention

59:37.520 --> 59:44.980
Is not hard to do my friend. It's really not if that's the goal. It's like my mom won't make me French toast anymore

59:44.980 --> 59:46.980
I'm going to Wendy's

59:47.600 --> 59:49.600
Sorry, dad

59:49.680 --> 59:52.400
No time for this. Anyway there, you know how your your

59:53.280 --> 59:58.240
Caregiver always cut your French toast into sticks and then parted it in a cardboard sleeve and charge you five dollars

59:58.640 --> 59:59.480
Yeah

59:59.480 --> 01:00:04.200
The memory the magic is back, but unfortunately the magic is also ended damn

01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:09.760
I bet you putting them in the in a frosty. I bet that goes down real. Oh, fuck you magic

They make they will make it your booty

01:02:58.020 --> 01:03:03.160
Like pop to the music to the rhythm in a good way in a great way it feels great

01:03:03.740 --> 01:03:07.660
I was I was doing that yesterday and it felt suit. It was good for my back

01:03:07.660 --> 01:03:11.020

01:03:11.900 --> 01:03:18.060
And thanks to maximum fun for having us on the network. Thanks maximum fun. You're well on the network. Whoa

01:03:18.700 --> 01:03:25.800
Jesse, where'd you come from? It's me. Jesse. I've descended from the heavens. Whoa, cool. Yep

01:03:27.740 --> 01:03:33.500
So that's it for the show I love you Griffin, how do we know how long it's been since we've sat down to record

01:03:33.500 --> 01:03:38.780
What I've been ma'am, it's been forever forever. Yeah. Yeah, maybe this is a good time for us to do like a quick

01:03:39.500 --> 01:03:40.660
reboot

01:03:40.660 --> 01:03:45.700
Refresh of how we end the show and maybe and this is just something I've been kicking around for a while

01:03:45.700 --> 01:03:50.500
It's not always contingent on me saying a funny thing

01:03:54.660 --> 01:03:56.660
Though yeah

01:03:56.660 --> 01:03:58.060
For sure and that's great

01:03:58.060 --> 01:04:05.060
But if we could find a way to have some of the pressure be taken off of me and put on you all for a while

01:04:05.060 --> 01:04:07.900
I think that that would be cool Griffin's right Griffin's right

01:04:07.900 --> 01:04:14.660
So at the end of every episode, I would like Griffin to start suggesting a bit that Travis and I can try

01:04:15.420 --> 01:04:17.340
next time and

01:04:17.340 --> 01:04:19.340
Then we'll see how it goes

01:04:19.540 --> 01:04:23.500
but this still does feel like a lot of pressure on me to generate the

01:04:23.500 --> 01:04:28.820
It's like you're asking me to write this one time just this one time. I'm gonna write a skit and then

01:04:29.740 --> 01:04:33.980
We'll talk about it in between see if it works and then if that's the one

01:04:34.540 --> 01:04:39.380
Okay, no more work from you required if it's not the one you just come up with another one

01:04:39.380 --> 01:04:44.260
And certainly that will be the one. Okay, so it's we're at a Jamba Juice. Okay, and

01:04:45.500 --> 01:04:49.140
You're but you both work there. You both work at the Jamba Juice

01:04:49.900 --> 01:04:51.660

01:04:53.900 --> 01:04:58.820
Like a among us imposter and you're trying to do bad things to the juice. Oh great

01:04:58.820 --> 01:05:03.500
Yeah, but it's up to the audience to try and figure out which one of you is trying to hurt the juice

01:05:03.500 --> 01:05:07.940
But we won't tell them so let's actually play that out right now. Oh, we'll try that next week

01:05:09.820 --> 01:05:15.860
