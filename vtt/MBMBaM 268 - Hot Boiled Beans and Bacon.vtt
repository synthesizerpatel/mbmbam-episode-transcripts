WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.480
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.480 --> 00:44.480
It's a new craze, and good girls do you wanna just say, hey I wanna, just say, hey I wanna.

00:44.480 --> 00:47.280
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother my brother meeting advice show for the modern

00:47.280 --> 00:51.040
era. I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother Travis McElroy.

00:51.040 --> 00:56.880
I'm your sweet ass brother Griffin McElroy. Your ass brother Griffin McElroy. Cycle 2-2,

00:56.880 --> 01:00.880
America's Next Top Model is back. Boys continue to be in the house.

01:00.880 --> 01:06.160
Boys are still in the house. That's still a heavy, still a heavy element of the show.

01:06.160 --> 01:07.360
Yeah. Isn't it? Like they still,

01:07.360 --> 01:10.960
like it's still in the theme song, boys in the house, but it's like boys in the house.

01:10.960 --> 01:13.440
Yeah, three years in. Boys are still in the house.

01:13.440 --> 01:16.800
They should shake it up and do like dogs and cats in the house.

01:16.800 --> 01:24.320
Yeah, well they had one angle that they started to pursue in this cycle of ANTM 2.2, which was-

01:24.320 --> 01:26.080
It's not two murderers in the house.

01:26.080 --> 01:27.520
It's a double X double I.

01:27.520 --> 01:28.640
Double X double I maybe.

01:32.160 --> 01:37.040
God, I hope everybody who listens to the show watches ANTM and if you don't, then piss off.

01:37.040 --> 01:38.160
We don't want you to listen. Wasting your time.

01:38.160 --> 01:46.480
Yeah. They had an angle this season, which was no beauty has no size or some shit like that,

01:46.480 --> 01:50.800
where you could just be small because all the models on past seasons are all like six foot

01:50.800 --> 01:54.400
beautiful and now they're like four foot lovely.

01:54.400 --> 01:58.160
I don't think they've ever done short and guys. That's like two things.

01:58.160 --> 01:59.600
A new combination.

01:59.600 --> 02:02.320
It's a new combination. Who's your favorite so far of the crew?

02:02.320 --> 02:03.280
Niall, definitely.

02:03.280 --> 02:04.720
Niall, definitely.

02:04.720 --> 02:10.640
Definitely Niall. I like Mamay. I think she's bringing a good style to it. She seems very

02:10.640 --> 02:14.560
professional and I think that's important for this environment.

02:14.560 --> 02:16.320
I think Tyra's going to win this year.

02:16.320 --> 02:17.600
What if Tyra just won?

02:18.880 --> 02:20.720
What if she was America's next top model?

02:20.720 --> 02:24.560
Do you know how fucking desperate she is every year when she announces the winner?

02:24.560 --> 02:29.840
Just like it catches on her tongue. Tyra. Tyra. I should win though.

02:31.440 --> 02:34.720
Niall, Justin, do you want to bust out Niall's amazing-

02:35.280 --> 02:38.240
Travis, you're not an ANTM fan, right? So I'm relating this to you.

02:38.240 --> 02:39.040
Yes, please.

02:39.040 --> 02:41.280
Niall is a deaf gentleman.

02:41.280 --> 02:44.800
Beautiful. Beautiful features. Beautiful jawline. He needs to work on it. He's not

02:44.800 --> 02:48.640
using his face sex very well and he's got a lot of it.

02:48.640 --> 02:50.560
Did you say face sacks?

02:50.560 --> 02:51.840
Face sacks.

02:52.400 --> 02:53.520
Sacks, okay.

02:54.240 --> 03:02.880
Yeah. Niall has two methods through which he communicates. One is an interpreter, which

03:02.880 --> 03:10.240
is amazing because he's just there and chilling and the models are in the house getting cray

03:10.240 --> 03:14.480
and he's just waiting for Niall to start waving his hands and making sign language so he can

03:14.480 --> 03:19.200
do something. But other than that, I bet he's contractually obligated to be silent. There's

03:19.200 --> 03:23.280
no way he's allowed to add to the drama of the house. He can't sleep around with the

03:23.280 --> 03:28.160
models, etc. So that's the one thing. The other thing is they gave him a phone that

03:28.160 --> 03:36.640
has a text-to-voice feature so every once in a while, this fool will just quiet the

03:36.640 --> 03:41.840
house with his cell phone. Just raise it above his head and blast his missives.

03:41.840 --> 03:48.320
Yes, on the episode I watched yesterday, one of the ladies was upset because they shaved

03:48.320 --> 03:54.960
half of her hair and it caused quite a stir and Niall raises his cell phone aloft and

03:54.960 --> 04:01.360
it says, you're all talking about hair, hair, hair. Do I complain about my deafness? No.

04:01.360 --> 04:02.160
Boom!

04:02.160 --> 04:08.880
It's like, okay, how did you sit on that for five episodes? There's been a lot of meaningless

04:08.880 --> 04:13.120
conversation up to this point. Why is this the moment to deploy?

04:13.120 --> 04:19.200
It is weird having the ASL interpreter in the house because it's weird to have somebody

04:19.200 --> 04:22.240
not, especially beautiful. He's got a beautiful spirit.

04:22.240 --> 04:27.360
I wish they would cut to him for the confessionals or he's just like, I couldn't care less.

04:27.360 --> 04:28.160
I just don't.

04:28.160 --> 04:30.720
He's not, no, you're right. He's not an ugly dude.

04:30.720 --> 04:31.360
He's not ugly.

04:31.360 --> 04:34.080
But he's walking amongst gods and goddesses.

04:34.080 --> 04:34.640
Right.

04:34.640 --> 04:41.520
I like totally, no one, no human could compete in this environment, but it makes him by comparison

04:41.520 --> 04:47.040
look like Gollum hiding in the shadows, waiting for somebody to drop a raw fish so he can

04:47.040 --> 04:49.520
skitter out and maybe interpret some sign language.

04:49.520 --> 04:55.840
I have in my head already like just mythologized, whatever, turn this gentleman just like as

04:55.840 --> 04:59.280
people are running through the house, like yelling at each other, like you stole my thing

04:59.280 --> 05:03.200
or whatever. He's just like quietly eating a sandwich at the kitchen counter and you

05:03.200 --> 05:06.640
just like see him in the background as the camera pans past him.

05:06.640 --> 05:07.360
No, he can't be.

05:08.240 --> 05:08.800
He can't be.

05:08.800 --> 05:11.280
They tried to make him stay off camera as much as possible.

05:11.280 --> 05:14.560
So he like hides behind curtains and just watches.

05:14.560 --> 05:16.640
You see his shoes smoking out the bottom.

05:16.640 --> 05:21.040
You see his shoes smoking out, waiting to interpret some sign language.

05:21.040 --> 05:24.320
It's, I mean, like we're having fun.

05:24.320 --> 05:28.000
It's kind of awesome that like for a show like this, they like, you know, made the

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
accommodations for this gentleman.

05:30.000 --> 05:36.800
It's just like it gives the whole show like this crazy, like, like sci-fi, like absurdist

05:36.800 --> 05:39.920
angle that there's just like a guy who's there also.

05:39.920 --> 05:42.800
Just like a traveler from the normal world.

05:42.800 --> 05:44.480
Studying what the beautiful people do.

05:45.040 --> 05:45.520
Exactly.

05:45.520 --> 05:49.680
It's cycle two point, cycle two to ASL interpreter in the house.

05:49.680 --> 05:56.560
I really, the amazing, one of the, the second most amazing moment from last night's episode

05:56.560 --> 06:00.560
is that one of the women was talking about the haircut she was getting and they said

06:00.560 --> 06:04.720
they're giving me a cut similar to Tyra's new look.

06:04.720 --> 06:12.000
And they literally pop a picture up of Tyra Banks in case in the last like 30 seconds

06:12.000 --> 06:17.040
since you have seen Tyra Banks on this show, you have forgotten what Tyra's new look looks

06:17.040 --> 06:17.600
like.

06:17.600 --> 06:20.000
Here is a reminder of Tyra Banks' visit.

06:20.000 --> 06:24.240
I mean, it definitely, definitely looks like the woman from House of Cards.

06:24.240 --> 06:26.800
It definitely looks like Robin Wright.

06:26.800 --> 06:27.760
Is that right?

06:27.760 --> 06:30.080
Formerly knee Robin Wright pen.

06:30.080 --> 06:30.320
Pen.

06:30.320 --> 06:31.600
Knee Robin Wright.

06:31.600 --> 06:31.920
Yeah.

06:31.920 --> 06:33.280
Used to be, not anymore.

06:33.280 --> 06:37.360
So that is our contractual obligated seven minutes on America's Next Top Model.

06:37.360 --> 06:43.840
This is an advice show as you've almost certainly gathered and we're ready to get into it.

06:43.840 --> 06:50.480
So let me pop open the top on this fresh batch of questions.

06:50.480 --> 06:55.920
A few weeks ago, a coworker informed me that she had quote some sort of Sega console in

06:55.920 --> 06:59.760
her basement and asked if I would be interested in taking it.

06:59.760 --> 07:04.080
I told her that I would be happy to take it off her hands and she promised to bring it

07:04.080 --> 07:05.280
in the next day.

07:05.280 --> 07:08.080
It has been a few weeks and she seems to have forgotten about it.

07:08.080 --> 07:12.160
I want it, but I feel like it'd be rude to pester her for something she said she'd give

07:12.160 --> 07:13.280
me for free.

07:13.280 --> 07:17.040
Is there a tactful way to bring it up and get my hands on it?

07:17.040 --> 07:20.880
That's from Seeking a Sega in St. Paul, whoosh.

07:20.880 --> 07:21.840
A lot of variables here.

07:21.840 --> 07:22.960
Before we get into this, I did just-

07:22.960 --> 07:24.240
So many variables.

07:24.240 --> 07:27.760
I want to ask about those tie overs.

07:27.760 --> 07:31.920
There was one woman who part of her tie over is they whitened her teeth and they didn't

07:31.920 --> 07:33.200
do that for anybody else.

07:34.320 --> 07:35.440
They didn't do that for anybody.

07:35.440 --> 07:39.120
Can you imagine being the one person that's like, oh, in addition to your haircut, we're

07:39.120 --> 07:40.400
also going to whiten your teeth.

07:40.400 --> 07:42.400
Like cool, is that a service everybody else is getting?

07:42.400 --> 07:44.320
No, just you.

07:44.320 --> 07:44.800
Just you.

07:44.800 --> 07:46.400
We're also going to bleach your butthole.

07:46.400 --> 07:47.760
If we're going to bleach your butt, is something...

07:47.760 --> 07:48.800
Oh, is everyone getting...

07:48.800 --> 07:50.640
No, it's just you.

07:50.640 --> 07:51.840
Just you.

07:51.840 --> 07:53.680
This is a special request.

07:53.680 --> 07:56.240
You have a special teeth and bowl.

07:57.360 --> 07:57.760
Anyway.

07:58.320 --> 08:01.440
Anyway, so okay.

08:01.440 --> 08:04.160
I feel like we have to provide several answers to this question.

08:04.160 --> 08:06.240
Number one, if it's a Sega Master System.

08:06.240 --> 08:06.640
Fuck it.

08:07.520 --> 08:07.920
Fuck it.

08:07.920 --> 08:09.040
It's not even worth it.

08:09.040 --> 08:10.560
What if it's a Sega CD?

08:10.560 --> 08:11.760
Sega CD, Justin D.

08:12.480 --> 08:15.440
If it's working, then I say go for it.

08:15.440 --> 08:20.880
A lot of them, because it has a motor in the spindle, a lot of those are like not functioning

08:20.880 --> 08:21.360
very well.

08:21.360 --> 08:30.080
So if it's a Sega CD system, or God almighty, if it's like a Nomad, for example.

08:30.080 --> 08:31.120
Oh my God, yeah.

08:31.120 --> 08:32.560
A Nomad, that would be amazing.

08:32.560 --> 08:38.560
Or one of the like, the CDX, where like the CD and Genesis is all like built in.

08:38.560 --> 08:40.000
The 32X, I think is what...

08:40.000 --> 08:40.720
No, no, no.

08:40.720 --> 08:42.080
The CDX is a different...

08:42.080 --> 08:42.560
Oh, that's right.

08:42.560 --> 08:43.360
That's right.

08:43.360 --> 08:43.760
It's a combined...

08:43.760 --> 08:45.920
Why does she just have this in her basement?

08:46.640 --> 08:49.280
Well, everybody's got a Sega system in their basement somewhere.

08:49.280 --> 08:52.960
My house doesn't even have a fucking basement, and I have a basement with like a Sega Saturn

08:52.960 --> 08:53.440
in it.

08:53.440 --> 08:56.560
Everyone has an old Sega system somewhere in their house, even if you don't...

08:56.560 --> 08:57.680
Oh, I just found mine.

08:57.680 --> 08:58.160
Oh, yeah.

08:58.160 --> 08:58.960
Oh, yeah.

08:58.960 --> 08:59.360
There it is.

08:59.360 --> 09:00.880
It was holding up my desk.

09:00.880 --> 09:02.880
I would also say a Saturn would not be worth it.

09:02.880 --> 09:07.440
Now, if it is a Dreamcast, you move heaven and earth.

09:07.440 --> 09:07.760
Yeah.

09:07.760 --> 09:09.440
Whatever, pester every day.

09:09.440 --> 09:10.160
Leave notes.

09:10.160 --> 09:11.120
Hide under her desk.

09:11.120 --> 09:11.620
Hello.

09:11.620 --> 09:13.540
Hello, it's me.

09:14.500 --> 09:16.020
Did you bring the Dreamcast today?

09:18.180 --> 09:20.420
Yeah, you just gotta let her know.

09:21.460 --> 09:23.700
I don't want to rule in on this though, unless I know.

09:24.420 --> 09:28.340
Because there's a ratio of effort to Sega system quality.

09:28.900 --> 09:31.460
Okay, but here's the other side of this, question asker.

09:32.340 --> 09:37.540
If she does remember in like two weeks and you didn't say anything, I think it compounds,

09:37.540 --> 09:39.380
and she goes, oh my God, I completely forgot.

09:39.380 --> 09:40.340
I'm so sorry.

09:40.340 --> 09:45.460
I didn't, but if you walk over and just go like, hey, do you still have that Sega system?

09:45.460 --> 09:46.980
And like, just bring it up.

09:48.340 --> 09:52.500
You're saying the longer you delay asking about it, the more eagerly she will...

09:52.500 --> 09:56.260
She'll be like, if you wait two months, she'll be like, oh my God, I can't believe I wasted

09:56.260 --> 09:57.140
two months of your life.

09:57.140 --> 10:01.300
Let me go, I'll get you the Dreamcast, and then I'll also go out and I'll buy you a copy

10:01.300 --> 10:06.500
of Shenmue, and a copy of Power Stone, and a copy of Sonic Adventure 2.

10:06.500 --> 10:09.460
What if in the interim, since she had this conversation with you,

10:09.460 --> 10:14.020
she saw your eyes light up when she mentioned she had a Dreamcast.

10:14.020 --> 10:16.260
Maybe she's like, what am I missing?

10:16.260 --> 10:19.620
Like, maybe I need to get deep into this fantastic system.

10:19.620 --> 10:23.380
And now she's like, oh yeah, I'll bring it to you as soon as I finish Blue Stinger.

10:23.380 --> 10:25.380
I just need to beat Seaman real quick.

10:25.380 --> 10:27.940
But here's the thing, you can't beat Seaman.

10:27.940 --> 10:28.900
It just keeps going.

10:28.900 --> 10:30.260
Seaman never ends.

10:30.260 --> 10:32.180
You can only beat Seaman once you kill him.

10:32.180 --> 10:32.660
That's true.

10:33.540 --> 10:34.580
That's not hard.

10:34.580 --> 10:37.620
Do you guys remember, can we tell the Seaman story of that time we went to the beach?

10:37.620 --> 10:38.120
Yeah.

10:39.140 --> 10:41.780
The two of you were, I killed my Seaman.

10:41.780 --> 10:44.100
Once Seaman learned to talk, and he was like, hey, dickhead.

10:44.100 --> 10:44.580
I'm like, nope.

10:45.380 --> 10:46.740
You're a real asshole.

10:46.740 --> 10:47.860
You're a jack weed.

10:47.860 --> 10:48.740
Hey, what's up?

10:49.460 --> 10:49.940
Not much.

10:49.940 --> 10:50.900
I'm going to boil you.

10:50.900 --> 10:54.340
Hey, did you bring any babes this time?

10:54.340 --> 10:55.780
I asked you to bring babes.

10:55.780 --> 10:57.300
Seaman, I can't.

10:57.300 --> 10:59.060
You have to kill your boss, Travis.

10:59.060 --> 10:59.940
Whoa, damn.

10:59.940 --> 11:00.660
Seaman, no.

11:01.220 --> 11:02.020
Kill your parents.

11:02.020 --> 11:03.140
Did you bring any weed?

11:03.140 --> 11:12.100
But so we went to the beach for vacation, and we left the AV cables at home for our Dreamcast.

11:12.100 --> 11:16.180
And we fucking flipped shit, because our Seamans were going to die.

11:16.180 --> 11:20.500
And we made our parents drive to the store and buy AV cables immediately.

11:21.540 --> 11:27.380
And it's worth noting that you can definitely, definitely, definitely change the clock on the

11:27.380 --> 11:28.020
Dreamcast.

11:28.020 --> 11:29.860
So that would not have been an issue.

11:29.860 --> 11:30.900
But we were idiot kids.

11:30.900 --> 11:31.700
What did we know?

11:31.700 --> 11:35.460
That was also the vacation, if I remember correctly, where we first saw Deep Blue Sea.

11:36.260 --> 11:37.380
Very momentous.

11:37.380 --> 11:39.380
Yeah, it's a very momentous occasion.

11:39.380 --> 11:43.940
Then there was that time in Philadelphia where we saw the guy who ran up to us and said,

11:43.940 --> 11:45.780
hey, I do something the whole family can enjoy.

11:47.060 --> 11:48.100
Backflips.

11:48.100 --> 11:48.980
And it was awesome.

11:48.980 --> 11:49.460
It was great.

11:49.460 --> 11:49.860
It was awesome.

11:50.500 --> 11:51.700
How many times have we told that story?

11:51.700 --> 11:56.500
But do you think that man knew, like, I'm going to immortalize myself with this desperate act

11:56.500 --> 11:57.460
of flipping?

11:57.460 --> 11:59.780
Maybe he was like a listener from the future.

11:59.780 --> 12:00.500
Oh, shit.

12:00.500 --> 12:01.060
Shit.

12:01.060 --> 12:06.820
Listen, in order to avoid a catastrophic paradox, you must have your whole family watch me do

12:06.820 --> 12:07.220
flips.

12:07.780 --> 12:09.700
Also, I would appreciate a $5 bill.

12:09.700 --> 12:10.100
$5 would go down.

12:10.100 --> 12:11.300
Which maybe we gave him.

12:11.300 --> 12:12.580
Maybe he was saving our lives.

12:12.580 --> 12:17.140
Maybe, like, 10 feet ahead of us as he was doing the backflip, a sniper shot rang out.

12:20.340 --> 12:22.900
It was the only thing, like, he was coming up with it in the moment.

12:22.900 --> 12:26.340
Like, I do something the whole family can enjoy.

12:26.340 --> 12:28.420
And then the first thing that came to his mind is backflip.

12:28.420 --> 12:29.940
And he thought, oh, fuck.

12:29.940 --> 12:31.220
What if the sniper saw him?

12:31.220 --> 12:32.660
Like, oh, no, he's getting in the way.

12:32.660 --> 12:33.460
And then he shot.

12:33.460 --> 12:34.660
And then he flips.

12:34.660 --> 12:37.060
And the bullet misses him because it goes where his head was.

12:37.060 --> 12:41.060
And then as we walked away, he just looked at little Griffin and said, you're safe now,

12:41.060 --> 12:43.300
great, great, great, great grandfather.

12:43.300 --> 12:44.900
You're safe now, Mr. President.

12:44.900 --> 12:48.180
What if he realized after he said backflip, he didn't know how to do a backflip?

12:48.180 --> 12:49.780
And he just had to summon it in that moment.

12:50.740 --> 12:51.540
Well, you did leap.

12:51.540 --> 12:52.980
And then you spun backwards.

12:55.060 --> 12:56.660
Because that's a backflip, Travis.

12:56.660 --> 12:57.380
Oh, yeah, yeah.

12:57.380 --> 12:57.940
Sheesh.

12:57.940 --> 13:06.340
I would honestly, if this was me, I would have already, like, asked about it.

13:06.340 --> 13:06.820
Yeah, for sure.

13:07.620 --> 13:10.340
Maybe say, like, there's a casual way.

13:10.340 --> 13:14.420
Maybe say, like, hey, did you ever figure out what kind of Sega console you had?

13:14.420 --> 13:16.500
Because I was going to buy a couple of controls for it on eBay.

13:17.380 --> 13:19.460
Because I found a good deal on some.

13:20.660 --> 13:21.140
How about a Yahoo?

13:21.140 --> 13:24.420
And then if she says it's a Sega Master System, push her into a well.

13:24.420 --> 13:24.980
Yeah, sure.

13:24.980 --> 13:31.860
Sure, thanks, I was looking for, I was really psyched to play Alex.

13:31.860 --> 13:34.580
No, fuck, I can't even pretend, kid chameleon.

13:34.580 --> 13:35.460
Shit, whatever.

13:35.460 --> 13:37.220
Do you guys want to, that was Sega Genesis.

13:37.220 --> 13:37.940
Fuck, whatever.

13:37.940 --> 13:38.740
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

13:38.740 --> 13:40.500
I wanted to play Willy Beamish.

13:40.500 --> 13:41.780
No, a Sega CD.

13:41.780 --> 13:42.020
Yeah.

13:42.020 --> 13:44.820
I actually think you're thinking about Alex Kidd in Miracle World.

13:44.820 --> 13:46.100
Alex Kidd in Miracle World.

13:46.100 --> 13:46.420
Shit.

13:46.420 --> 13:46.740
Yeah.

13:47.860 --> 13:48.260
Damn it.

13:48.260 --> 13:48.980
How about a Yahoo?

13:49.700 --> 13:50.100
Yep.

13:50.100 --> 13:51.780
This one was sent in by level9000.

13:51.780 --> 13:52.900
Yeah, Drew, Drew, Drew Davenport.

13:52.900 --> 13:53.300
Thank you, Drew.

13:53.300 --> 13:54.580
It's by YeahDrewAnswer.

13:54.580 --> 13:55.460
Oh, they're anonymous.

13:56.260 --> 13:58.980
Didn't want the word getting out on this one.

13:59.540 --> 14:02.980
It's on the society and culture etiquette category.

14:02.980 --> 14:11.140
And Solid Snake here asks, how do you play Snuggle Bug at a party?

14:11.140 --> 14:11.620
Rules?

14:12.580 --> 14:13.060
Pardon?

14:13.700 --> 14:16.660
How do you play Snuggle Bug at a party?

14:16.660 --> 14:17.140
Rules?

14:17.140 --> 14:26.740
What are the rules to the popular party game that is known widely across the world and

14:26.740 --> 14:28.580
this beautiful country as Snuggle Bug?

14:29.620 --> 14:30.580
Griffin, what?

14:31.700 --> 14:32.500
How do you even-

14:32.500 --> 14:36.980
You gotta stop bringing this stuff unless you've done a base amount of research.

14:36.980 --> 14:38.020
I mean, I got the wiki out.

14:38.020 --> 14:39.220
Let me break it down for you guys.

14:39.220 --> 14:40.500
I'll just answer the question.

14:41.860 --> 14:45.140
You get a fairly large group of friends together, at least five people.

14:45.780 --> 14:46.900
Oh my God, I'm reading the rules.

14:46.900 --> 14:51.940
It says, get a mixture of male and female players, or if you want, it can be single sexed.

14:51.940 --> 14:58.260
So basically, fucking any, like almost in-

14:58.260 --> 15:02.900
You can have two guys, three girls, three guys, two girls.

15:02.900 --> 15:03.780
And a pizza place.

15:04.420 --> 15:06.100
Snuggle with a pizza place.

15:06.100 --> 15:09.140
They have managed to be redundant and also exclusionary.

15:09.140 --> 15:12.340
So like, if you just don't identify, like you can't play Snuggle Bug.

15:12.340 --> 15:13.220
That's the one thing.

15:13.220 --> 15:17.540
If you don't identify with the single gender, like there is no Snuggle Bug in your future.

15:17.540 --> 15:18.660
I'm very sorry.

15:18.660 --> 15:20.420
And wikiHow is the authority on it.

15:20.420 --> 15:22.500
This is the rule book.

15:23.460 --> 15:25.220
Get a bowl or anything similar to that.

15:25.220 --> 15:27.700
For example, a hat, a pillowcase, a bucket.

15:27.700 --> 15:29.620
So again, fucking anything.

15:30.420 --> 15:31.940
Go to a suitable location.

15:31.940 --> 15:34.020
If your parents give you permission, you could use your house.

15:34.020 --> 15:35.620
Your parents will not give you permission.

15:35.620 --> 15:38.260
Mom, dad, I would love to get my snug on.

15:38.260 --> 15:39.780
Can I use your room?

15:39.780 --> 15:41.060
Can I use your marital bed?

15:41.060 --> 15:43.940
Dad, wherever you go, be sure there are places you can hide.

15:43.940 --> 15:46.500
Not somewhere like behind a sofa, but a different room.

15:46.500 --> 15:48.100
Come on, bring it.

15:48.100 --> 15:49.140
You're not even trying.

15:49.140 --> 15:50.420
Behind the sofa?

15:50.420 --> 15:51.700
Fuck, come on.

15:51.700 --> 15:55.540
Get everyone who is playing to one place and get them to stand wherever they want.

15:55.540 --> 15:57.300
Nope, get them to sit.

15:57.300 --> 15:59.940
Get them to sit or stand wherever they want.

15:59.940 --> 16:00.820
Sit or stand.

16:00.820 --> 16:02.740
Okay, just as long as they're not like fucking-

16:02.740 --> 16:04.420
No crouching, don't be prone.

16:04.420 --> 16:05.140
Yeah.

16:05.140 --> 16:06.420
No hovering.

16:06.420 --> 16:09.220
Get strips of paper so each person playing has one.

16:09.220 --> 16:13.780
On all the strips of paper except for one, write down, you're not the snuggle bug.

16:13.780 --> 16:16.340
Or if you want to save time, just leave it blank.

16:16.340 --> 16:19.060
Yes, no, I really want to put the effort into this.

16:19.060 --> 16:22.660
On one of the pieces of paper, you write down, you're the snuggle bug.

16:22.660 --> 16:23.860
Got it.

16:23.860 --> 16:26.900
On one of the pieces of paper, write down, I'm going to kill you, Devon.

16:26.900 --> 16:30.900
Give everyone a strip of paper from the quote unquote bowl.

16:30.900 --> 16:32.580
Like, okay, we get it.

16:32.580 --> 16:35.380
They can read it, but they don't let anyone know what they have.

16:35.380 --> 16:38.100
Ask some people to volunteer to search for the snuggle bug.

16:38.100 --> 16:39.060
It shouldn't be too many.

16:39.060 --> 16:41.860
About two people searching for every five people playing.

16:43.060 --> 16:44.420
This is fucking crazy.

16:44.420 --> 16:48.100
And then turn off the lights and everyone should spread out searching for the snuggle bug

16:48.100 --> 16:49.540
who should have gone and hidden.

16:49.540 --> 16:50.340
I don't understand.

16:50.340 --> 16:52.420
I need you to back up to the last step of the game.

16:52.420 --> 16:55.140
I don't understand the search phase of snuggle bug.

16:55.140 --> 16:56.820
You go searching for snuggle bugs.

16:57.460 --> 16:59.540
Some people go searching for snuggle bug.

17:00.100 --> 17:04.820
Also, if you're the snuggle bug, don't mess up the game and volunteer to search for the snuggle bug.

17:04.820 --> 17:05.780
It's just really annoying.

17:06.500 --> 17:08.580
But that seems like that would be the best way to go

17:08.580 --> 17:11.300
because then you just make the other searcher disappear.

17:11.300 --> 17:15.060
Right, turn off the lights and everyone should spread out

17:15.060 --> 17:17.780
searching for the snuggle bug who should have gone and hidden.

17:18.420 --> 17:23.460
And 11, this is the last instruction.

17:24.580 --> 17:28.580
Snuggle if you find the snuggle bug or if they want they can do anything else.

17:28.580 --> 17:29.460
Oh shit.

17:29.460 --> 17:30.660
Fuck if you find the snuggle bug.

17:30.660 --> 17:33.140
Hey, do you guys want to play over the pants stuff bug?

17:34.340 --> 17:36.580
It's a new favorite teen game.

17:36.580 --> 17:39.780
This rule set is crazy.

17:39.780 --> 17:42.340
You draw it and one person's the snuggle bug

17:42.340 --> 17:44.820
and then people have to volunteer to search for the snuggle bug.

17:44.820 --> 17:47.700
This mission, this is a mission you may not come back from.

17:47.700 --> 17:49.460
Why wouldn't you go search for the snuggle bug?

17:50.020 --> 17:53.140
If you're going to play snuggle bug, why wouldn't you go search for the snuggle bug?

17:53.140 --> 17:54.100
It's a binary.

17:54.100 --> 17:56.340
You're either searching for the snuggle bug or not.

17:56.340 --> 17:57.060
And then what are you?

17:57.060 --> 17:59.060
You're just fucking sitting or standing around.

17:59.860 --> 18:01.620
This is crazy.

18:01.620 --> 18:06.260
Well, you have to hide somewhere, but like in another room, not behind the couch, dipshit.

18:06.260 --> 18:10.260
And then like, I guess when you find people and they're like-

18:10.260 --> 18:13.780
No, what he's saying, only the snuggle bug needs to hide.

18:13.780 --> 18:16.580
And only some of the people who are not the snuggle bug

18:17.140 --> 18:19.940
volunteer to go search for the snuggle bug.

18:19.940 --> 18:22.420
And when you find them, it's just like a big snuggle pile

18:22.420 --> 18:24.660
or only the searchers get to snuggle them?

18:24.660 --> 18:27.060
If you find the snuggle bug, you snuggle them.

18:27.060 --> 18:28.580
This is the fucking worst.

18:28.580 --> 18:30.900
If you're searching for, there are some tips here.

18:30.900 --> 18:33.220
If you're searching for the snuggle bug, but are having a hard time,

18:33.220 --> 18:36.260
you could team up with another person who's also searching for the snuggle bug.

18:36.260 --> 18:37.780
Do a little three-way snuggle.

18:37.780 --> 18:39.780
Could my other person be a bloodhound?

18:40.740 --> 18:42.900
You gotta be careful though.

18:42.900 --> 18:45.300
If the two of you find it, it turns into a reservoir of dogs.

18:45.300 --> 18:49.940
Like who's gonna snuggle this bug and you don't trust the other person.

18:49.940 --> 18:52.180
There's a lot of backstabbing and underhanded.

18:52.180 --> 18:54.420
Snuggle does sound like a cutthroat game.

18:54.420 --> 18:55.940
It sounds like a bullshit game.

18:55.940 --> 18:58.580
Where's the resource trading phase?

18:59.300 --> 19:00.180
Wait a minute.

19:00.180 --> 19:04.340
This is an excuse for teens to grope each other.

19:05.460 --> 19:07.700
Okay, it's not a game.

19:07.700 --> 19:09.380
It's a grope thing.

19:09.380 --> 19:10.660
Hey, you know what teens?

19:10.660 --> 19:11.620
Just grope.

19:11.620 --> 19:12.500
Just grope teens.

19:12.500 --> 19:13.940
What's with all the artifice?

19:13.940 --> 19:16.100
Be careful about, I mean, protect your heart.

19:16.100 --> 19:17.620
Oh no, consensual groping.

19:17.620 --> 19:20.580
Yeah, protect your heart, protect your treasure and all that.

19:20.580 --> 19:25.380
But it's just, this is just, I'm all about coming up with excuses

19:25.380 --> 19:28.420
to rub up against your friends if both of you are into it.

19:28.420 --> 19:30.580
But it's just, this is a bad game.

19:30.580 --> 19:32.420
I have a new game I've invented.

19:32.420 --> 19:32.820
Okay.

19:32.820 --> 19:34.180
And this is how you play the game.

19:34.180 --> 19:37.700
You look at somebody and you say, hey, do you want to snuggle with me?

19:37.700 --> 19:40.420
And if they say yes, you snuggle.

19:40.420 --> 19:42.980
And if they say no, you say, that's totally cool.

19:42.980 --> 19:44.100
I understand.

19:44.100 --> 19:46.100
And then you move on to the next player.

19:47.380 --> 19:51.940
I just feel like in inventing Snuggle Bug, they invented a reason

19:51.940 --> 19:55.060
to consensually fondle each other and didn't stop to think about

19:55.060 --> 19:57.700
the collateral damage, which is that I might have to read

19:57.700 --> 19:59.300
the rules of Snuggle Bug someday.

19:59.300 --> 20:02.020
Can you imagine if you are the Snuggle Bug, right?

20:03.460 --> 20:04.820
Okay, I'm behind a couch.

20:04.820 --> 20:06.100
No, wait, fuck.

20:06.100 --> 20:06.820
No, do better.

20:08.100 --> 20:10.340
This is the plot of Eyes Wide Shut 2.

20:11.940 --> 20:13.540
I have excellent news.

20:13.540 --> 20:13.860
Oh boy.

20:13.860 --> 20:19.780
Mickey Howe is apparently chock full of bullshit rules for fake made up games.

20:19.780 --> 20:22.900
Can I interest you gentlemen in the three steps you need to know

20:22.900 --> 20:27.860
to play hot boiled beans and bacon?

20:27.860 --> 20:28.580
Yes, please.

20:29.620 --> 20:32.740
One, send the person to find the object outside.

20:32.740 --> 20:37.140
Like, you have not set up a vocabulary for any of this shit.

20:37.140 --> 20:39.300
Like, I don't know what any of that means.

20:39.300 --> 20:40.020
What object?

20:40.020 --> 20:42.340
He who is chosen will know.

20:42.340 --> 20:43.780
He who is chosen will be called.

20:44.340 --> 20:49.460
Have the rest of the players hide any not too large object in the room?

20:49.460 --> 20:53.060
Like, this is a group activity.

20:53.060 --> 20:55.700
Like, don't hide a big screen TV.

20:55.700 --> 21:00.260
When they have hidden it, shout outside, hot boiled beans and bacon.

21:00.260 --> 21:01.860
It's hidden, but can be taken.

21:03.380 --> 21:04.660
Hot boiled beans and bacon.

21:05.540 --> 21:08.740
It's time for the rites, the sacrament to begin.

21:10.100 --> 21:12.660
Hot boiled beans and bacon, the purge has begun.

21:13.620 --> 21:16.740
When she gets close to the object, say you're getting hot.

21:16.740 --> 21:19.460
Or if she's going away from it, say you're getting cold.

21:19.460 --> 21:24.980
If she's very cold or very hot, it denotes that he is either very close to the object,

21:24.980 --> 21:27.460
very hot, or she is very far from the object, very cold.

21:28.260 --> 21:29.860
Holy shit, we get it.

21:29.860 --> 21:32.180
If she's extremely near to the object, yell you're burning.

21:32.180 --> 21:34.340
If she's extremely far from the object, say she's freezing.

21:34.340 --> 21:35.620
Set them on fire.

21:35.620 --> 21:37.860
When she finds the object, reward her with a small prize,

21:37.860 --> 21:39.460
and then there's a picture of a Snickers bar.

21:40.980 --> 21:42.340
A fun-sized Snickers bar.

21:43.140 --> 21:44.660
Because they're having fun.

21:44.660 --> 21:48.260
That would be the only, here's one of the tips.

21:49.380 --> 21:53.620
Good prizes are bags of pretzels, little toys, candy, et cetera.

21:54.340 --> 21:58.900
Good things to hide are hats, dolls, shoes, books, et cetera.

22:00.100 --> 22:05.300
Good places to hide are on blue shelves, under the sofa, in a drawer, et cetera.

22:05.940 --> 22:09.700
If the weather is bad outside, just send the person into another room with a blindfold on.

22:09.700 --> 22:13.940
Maybe some earplugs or earmuff so she can't hear where you're putting the object.

22:13.940 --> 22:16.260
Capital S for no reason at the end.

22:16.900 --> 22:22.660
That's like, did so, oh man.

22:24.100 --> 22:25.620
Did we just break Justin?

22:25.620 --> 22:29.780
Now I'm looking at the community member who wrote this and it looks like he's 11.

22:29.780 --> 22:31.380
I need to know, I need to know his name.

22:32.740 --> 22:34.420
His name is Daniel and he's from Belgium.

22:35.540 --> 22:36.420
Okay, maybe.

22:36.420 --> 22:39.220
So they don't have hot and cold over there, is what you're telling me.

22:39.940 --> 22:42.260
This kid was just like, oh, I'm on some new dope shit.

22:42.260 --> 22:43.860
Guys, guys, guys, he's at the playground.

22:43.860 --> 22:46.260
Guys, I'm on some next level shit over here.

22:46.260 --> 22:47.540
What if you hid the object?

22:47.540 --> 22:48.260
What object?

22:48.260 --> 22:51.140
Shut the fuck, shut your fucking mouth and let me finish.

22:51.140 --> 22:54.580
You hide the object and then when people get far away from it, they're cold,

22:54.580 --> 22:56.180
but they get close, they're hot.

22:56.180 --> 22:58.180
Boiled beans and bacon.

22:59.620 --> 23:00.980
I'm really hungry now.

23:00.980 --> 23:03.220
Yeah, for hot boiled beans and bacon?

23:03.220 --> 23:04.260
No, just in general.

23:04.820 --> 23:08.820
So I'm in the bathroom at work and I hear an iPhone camera take a picture in the stall.

23:08.820 --> 23:09.940
How should one respond?

23:09.940 --> 23:14.100
You're just bragging, you know how to respond.

23:15.860 --> 23:17.540
Say no paparazzi, please.

23:17.540 --> 23:20.180
Yeah, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

23:20.180 --> 23:21.220
Listen, listen, listen.

23:21.220 --> 23:22.180
Hey, guys, listen.

23:23.220 --> 23:24.580
No pooparazzi.

23:24.580 --> 23:25.380
Hey, pretty good.

23:25.380 --> 23:31.700
I um, I did this once cause there's some really fun graffiti in a bathroom at

23:31.700 --> 23:34.100
one of the places we went on the midwest tour.

23:34.100 --> 23:35.140
And I was like, oh, great.

23:35.140 --> 23:36.260
And I snapped a picture.

23:36.260 --> 23:39.060
And for some reason you can't like mute that particular function

23:39.060 --> 23:40.100
on your phone.

23:40.100 --> 23:42.440
And so, yeah, it definitely sounded like

23:42.440 --> 23:45.600
I was either doing a dick or turd picture.

23:45.600 --> 23:48.380
And neither of those are things I want.

23:48.380 --> 23:50.600
So if you're the picture taker, you have to just say like,

23:50.600 --> 23:53.140
I'm taking a graffiti picture, snap.

23:53.140 --> 23:56.160
Out loud, this is of graffiti.

23:56.160 --> 23:58.560
Please don't misconstrue this camera sound.

23:58.560 --> 24:01.520
I am not displaying neither my junk nor my turd.

24:01.520 --> 24:02.760
But see, I would respond,

24:02.760 --> 24:05.680
that's exactly what a junk snapper would say.

24:05.680 --> 24:07.100
So maybe you announce like,

24:07.100 --> 24:09.240
I am taking a picture of my dick.

24:09.240 --> 24:10.880
And then they're like, well, he's definitely not.

24:10.880 --> 24:11.720
He wouldn't say it out loud.

24:11.720 --> 24:13.200
Well, no, because that's definitely something

24:13.200 --> 24:15.240
a dick snapper would say.

24:15.240 --> 24:17.900
Here's what you do, is you say, you go,

24:18.860 --> 24:20.820
and then you ask the person in the stall next to you

24:20.820 --> 24:21.660
for their phone number.

24:21.660 --> 24:23.500
And then you text them the picture you just took.

24:23.500 --> 24:25.200
That is the only way to get like

24:25.200 --> 24:27.440
actual verifiable evidence on this.

24:28.360 --> 24:30.680
What if you heard like, right after that,

24:30.680 --> 24:33.400
you heard the door open and an aide say,

24:33.400 --> 24:34.960
Representative Wiener, it's time for the-

24:34.960 --> 24:37.000
Oh, Justin, really?

24:37.000 --> 24:39.320
It's 20, Justin, it's 2015.

24:39.320 --> 24:41.640
You guys heard about this story?

24:41.640 --> 24:42.480
Let me try again.

24:42.480 --> 24:43.520
Justin.

24:43.520 --> 24:44.360
Have you heard the door open and hear-

24:44.360 --> 24:45.200
Y'all heard about this?

24:45.200 --> 24:47.560
Your representative of Favre, it's time,

24:47.560 --> 24:49.080
also in this fiction. Oh, good, good.

24:49.080 --> 24:50.280
Brett Favre has been elected

24:50.280 --> 24:51.440
to the House of Representatives.

24:51.440 --> 24:52.260
Yeah, sure.

24:52.260 --> 24:53.360
Was this last year too?

24:53.360 --> 24:56.640
Was last year just not a great year for dicks?

24:56.640 --> 24:59.000
Or a great year for dicks.

24:59.000 --> 25:01.560
I would argue a bad year for dicks.

25:01.560 --> 25:03.400
Brett Favre's 100,000 years old,

25:03.400 --> 25:04.860
and he's probably got a little bit of

25:04.860 --> 25:07.720
football-related mangling going on down there.

25:07.720 --> 25:08.560
He's got a football dick.

25:08.560 --> 25:10.800
Listen, he's a wonderful, he's a great quarterback,

25:10.800 --> 25:12.880
and he did great things for the Green Bay Packers,

25:12.880 --> 25:16.640
but his dick is just beef jerky down there.

25:16.640 --> 25:17.880
Who's that celebrity dick pic

25:17.880 --> 25:19.480
you're always trying to get me to look at?

25:19.480 --> 25:20.500
Oh, Jeff Probst?

25:21.920 --> 25:24.380
I don't try to get anybody

25:24.380 --> 25:26.240
to look at a picture of Jeff Probst's dick.

25:26.240 --> 25:30.240
I just do it, I do it, I just do it.

25:30.240 --> 25:31.720
He'll mask the file name,

25:31.720 --> 25:33.300
and they just tell me to pop it open,

25:33.300 --> 25:34.140
and then there it is.

25:34.140 --> 25:35.920
Travis will be at the beach,

25:35.920 --> 25:38.080
and a bottle will wash up on shore,

25:38.080 --> 25:39.760
and he'll unfurl a scroll inside,

25:39.760 --> 25:43.520
and it'll be a JPEG, printed out JPEG, of Probst's member.

25:45.280 --> 25:47.580
It's just, it's a great, it's a great,

25:47.580 --> 25:49.160
and it's ethically dubious,

25:49.160 --> 25:52.000
but it's a great picture of a dick.

25:52.000 --> 25:55.440
Cool dick, he looks really happy.

25:55.440 --> 25:56.560
Cool pose.

25:56.560 --> 25:58.000
Let's break down all the great pics.

25:58.000 --> 25:59.160
Let me open it up.

25:59.160 --> 26:01.600
Well lit, yes, fantastic photo quality.

26:01.600 --> 26:03.400
Great, I have to load it up,

26:03.400 --> 26:04.240
because I don't want to get it.

26:04.240 --> 26:05.560
I think Ann Geddes took it.

26:07.200 --> 26:09.280
His dick is resting on a sunflower.

26:10.480 --> 26:12.540
It's a fun thing to type in.

26:12.540 --> 26:14.400
It's a fun thing to search for.

26:14.400 --> 26:16.820
So just to go down the line, looking at it now,

26:16.820 --> 26:18.760
I'm looking at a censored version, which is fine.

26:18.760 --> 26:22.900
He's got a nice necklace on

26:22.900 --> 26:24.400
that looks like something you'd wear on the show,

26:24.400 --> 26:25.600
that's fun.

26:25.600 --> 26:27.480
He's got the best part of the picture.

26:27.480 --> 26:30.440
Again, great hog, but the best part of the picture,

26:31.560 --> 26:33.040
well, okay, the second best part of the picture

26:33.040 --> 26:33.880
is his face.

26:33.880 --> 26:35.000
He's so happy.

26:35.000 --> 26:37.160
He's really very, very legitimately happy.

26:37.160 --> 26:38.780
He's fucking gized about it.

26:38.780 --> 26:41.640
He's super gized about this whole situation,

26:41.640 --> 26:43.440
and that's what makes me feel less bad about it.

26:43.440 --> 26:45.600
The look on his face is that he was,

26:45.600 --> 26:50.480
through some sort of time temporal disturbance,

26:50.480 --> 26:54.080
he was present at the invention of the camera,

26:54.080 --> 26:57.320
as though he was taking a history-making dick shot.

26:57.320 --> 27:00.520
Like it was the first dick shot that he had ever taken.

27:00.520 --> 27:02.480
I thought that his face made it appear

27:02.480 --> 27:04.480
as though he just discovered he had a dick,

27:04.480 --> 27:07.280
and he was really proud and excited by it.

27:07.280 --> 27:09.120
So the best thing about the picture

27:09.120 --> 27:11.640
is he has a farmer's tan

27:11.640 --> 27:14.200
around where his cargo shorts always are,

27:14.200 --> 27:17.760
because this motherfucker's always wearing cargo shorts,

27:17.760 --> 27:19.080
always wearing cargo shorts.

27:19.080 --> 27:20.600
Even when he's not on the island,

27:20.600 --> 27:22.260
and he's not adjudicating,

27:22.260 --> 27:25.040
this motherfucker's cargo shorts 24-7,

27:25.040 --> 27:27.280
and now it's like a perfect little picture frame

27:27.280 --> 27:29.280
for his cool wang.

27:29.280 --> 27:31.200
Well, think about it.

27:31.200 --> 27:33.280
Cargo shorts are his work clothes.

27:33.280 --> 27:35.900
It's like, how can you get more cash than that?

27:35.900 --> 27:38.800
You can't dress down when you're not at the office.

27:38.800 --> 27:41.160
Like, it's just a baseline of cargo shorts.

27:41.160 --> 27:43.060
Like shorter cargo shorts?

27:43.960 --> 27:46.640
I guess, or like, they're faux cargo shorts,

27:46.640 --> 27:48.360
but they're made out of sweatpants material.

27:48.360 --> 27:49.740
Maybe that's an option.

27:50.760 --> 27:51.600
I like that.

27:51.600 --> 27:52.840
This picture brings me alive.

27:52.840 --> 27:55.080
But again, great hog.

27:55.080 --> 27:55.920
Cool hog, right?

27:55.920 --> 27:57.720
Just pants dressing up, top-notch wang.

27:58.680 --> 27:59.520
Great penis.

27:59.520 --> 28:03.560
By the way, I also do want to say that it,

28:03.560 --> 28:06.600
just to reiterate, we know it is ethically dicey.

28:06.600 --> 28:07.900
We understand that.

28:07.900 --> 28:09.080
Just wanted to say.

28:09.080 --> 28:10.520
It's the only one I need.

28:10.520 --> 28:13.240
I get no erotic satisfaction out of it.

28:13.240 --> 28:15.800
It's a sort of spiritual satisfaction.

28:15.800 --> 28:17.520
You like his hot beans and bacon.

28:17.520 --> 28:19.160
Oh God, let's go to the mighty zone.

28:19.160 --> 28:33.920
This week, my brother, my brother and me sponsored by harrys.com.

28:33.920 --> 28:35.440
We've talked about it before.

28:35.440 --> 28:36.440
We're big fans.

28:36.440 --> 28:37.440
Harry's.

28:37.440 --> 28:42.720
It's razors, but like new and cool in a new cool way.

28:42.720 --> 28:44.600
Not like the old shitty way.

28:44.600 --> 28:46.020
Which was what?

28:46.020 --> 28:49.140
The old shitty way was you had to like go to the store

28:49.140 --> 28:52.280
and like find somebody to unlock a case

28:52.280 --> 28:55.880
and like hand you like they were nuclear launch codes,

28:55.880 --> 28:57.400
like your razor blades and stuff.

28:57.400 --> 29:00.400
But with Harry's, ship it right to your door.

29:00.400 --> 29:01.620
And you hear that and you think,

29:01.620 --> 29:03.240
so I bet it's super expensive.

29:03.240 --> 29:06.000
Like that wine of the month club I belong to.

29:06.000 --> 29:07.040
But it's not.

29:07.040 --> 29:08.120
It's very affordable.

29:08.120 --> 29:11.800
In fact, you can get a Harry starter set for just $15,

29:11.800 --> 29:15.280
which includes a razor, foaming shave gel or shave cream,

29:15.280 --> 29:18.320
and three razor blades, plus free shipping.

29:18.320 --> 29:20.680
Like that's an incredible deal.

29:20.680 --> 29:22.120
Yeah, it's a great deal.

29:22.120 --> 29:23.720
I'm just furiously searching

29:23.720 --> 29:24.720
because now I'm starting to worry

29:24.720 --> 29:27.600
because I did a search for Jeff Probst dick.

29:27.600 --> 29:30.160
And I'm worried that this picture

29:30.160 --> 29:32.720
that I built a significant part of my life around.

29:32.720 --> 29:33.800
Don't say it.

29:33.800 --> 29:36.080
Might be a fakey fake bullshit.

29:36.080 --> 29:36.920
No.

29:38.080 --> 29:41.040
And here's the thing, you can go to harrys.com right now

29:41.040 --> 29:43.040
and get $5 off the starter set

29:43.040 --> 29:45.320
with the code mybrother, all one word.

29:45.320 --> 29:48.000
So that's just for $10.

29:48.000 --> 29:50.640
You can get the razor foaming shave gel or shave cream

29:50.640 --> 29:52.560
and three razor blades plus free shipping

29:52.560 --> 29:54.480
using the code mybrother.

29:54.480 --> 29:57.320
Start shaving better today.

29:57.320 --> 29:59.920
We got our correspondent Griffin McElroy on a story.

29:59.920 --> 30:02.800
In the meantime, Jason Worsets,

30:02.800 --> 30:05.620
I have a message for you from Gina Worsets Able.

30:05.620 --> 30:08.400
Dear Jason, happy belated birthday, big brother.

30:08.400 --> 30:10.540
I hope this puts the biggest smile on your face

30:10.540 --> 30:14.320
while you recover from the traumatic going upstairs injury.

30:14.320 --> 30:17.320
Sorry you can't have nice things like bones.

30:17.320 --> 30:20.080
I miss you so much since you moved across the country,

30:20.080 --> 30:22.040
but can't wait to reunite with you

30:22.040 --> 30:25.000
at the NBNB AM show in Portland.

30:25.000 --> 30:26.760
Love, Gina.

30:26.760 --> 30:27.980
I hope that happens.

30:27.980 --> 30:29.360
I hope that happened too.

30:29.360 --> 30:31.320
That would be weird if he was like, wait a minute,

30:31.320 --> 30:32.400
she was at that show?

30:33.320 --> 30:34.840
She didn't tell me that.

30:34.840 --> 30:35.680
She didn't tell me that.

30:35.680 --> 30:38.340
Maybe she was waiting for the message to be played.

30:38.340 --> 30:39.800
Well, now it has been.

30:39.800 --> 30:42.880
And so very belated happy birthday to you, Jason.

30:42.880 --> 30:44.480
And I hope that you've recovered, Jason.

30:44.480 --> 30:45.640
Quick update on this story.

30:45.640 --> 30:49.280
Have yet to verify the veracity of the image in question,

30:49.280 --> 30:52.120
but I will say that if you Google search

30:53.200 --> 30:56.020
Jeff Probst's fake nude, you'll get a lot of hits.

30:56.880 --> 30:58.720
Griffin, have you checked out Snopes?

30:58.720 --> 31:01.260
There's actually a Snopes forum post.

31:01.260 --> 31:02.680
They have not confirmed it.

31:02.680 --> 31:03.520
What?

31:03.520 --> 31:05.400
There's just a lot of dicks of all sorts of.

31:06.440 --> 31:08.400
Wow, that's a lot of dicks.

31:08.400 --> 31:13.400
Adam Lumpy Franklin, I have a message for you from Samantha.

31:13.800 --> 31:15.880
And it says, happy 40th birthday

31:15.880 --> 31:18.840
to my favorite bacon loving cousin.

31:18.840 --> 31:22.120
I hope you and Shelly have convinced our favorite brother

31:22.120 --> 31:25.280
to come up and join us for your birthday festivities,

31:25.280 --> 31:27.360
or at least host a live show in Texas.

31:27.360 --> 31:28.960
Enjoy that office birthday cake.

31:28.960 --> 31:30.400
Thanks for being awesome.

31:30.400 --> 31:32.600
Love, your favorite cousin.

31:32.600 --> 31:33.560
You know what I like about that?

31:33.560 --> 31:36.320
Very direct, very to the point, very positive.

31:36.320 --> 31:37.680
Big fan of that message.

31:37.680 --> 31:38.920
I do think in there, though,

31:38.920 --> 31:42.080
are you saying Griffin's your favorite brother?

31:42.080 --> 31:43.840
Okay, let me see. What did I do?

31:43.840 --> 31:46.000
I think you're their favorite brother.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.480
While you were looking at Jeff Probst's possible fake dick.

31:48.480 --> 31:50.560
It's not even Jeff Probst anymore, guys.

31:50.560 --> 31:52.040
I have crossed the Rubicon,

31:52.040 --> 31:53.640
and searching Jeff Probst's fake nude

31:53.640 --> 31:56.240
is apparently a fucking AOL keyword

31:56.240 --> 31:58.480
to take you into a tunnel of dicks.

31:58.480 --> 32:01.040
You've hacked into the mainframe.

32:01.040 --> 32:04.200
I feel like Neil Armstrong,

32:04.200 --> 32:06.440
I am stepping foot onto a part of the internet

32:06.440 --> 32:09.320
where I am the first Voyager.

32:09.320 --> 32:10.480
I am the first explorer.

32:10.480 --> 32:12.320
I'm the first hit that these dick pics have made.

32:12.320 --> 32:14.520
You've entered the Delta Quadrant,

32:14.520 --> 32:16.760
and you can't come back, and it's full of Borg,

32:16.760 --> 32:19.320
and by Borg, I mean celebrity penises.

32:19.320 --> 32:20.640
Guys, there's nothing funnier

32:20.640 --> 32:23.280
than a bad, fake naked picture of Jeff Probst,

32:23.280 --> 32:25.720
where his head is like, there's some shit on here

32:25.720 --> 32:28.160
where it looks like he's got a crazy giraffe neck

32:28.160 --> 32:29.000
or something like that,

32:29.000 --> 32:31.840
and his face is way, way paler

32:31.840 --> 32:34.000
than the rest of his nude body.

32:34.000 --> 32:38.200
I have to get, I need to get the fuck out of here.

32:38.200 --> 32:40.680
Escape pod, escape pod, go.

32:40.680 --> 32:42.240
Get out of there, Griffin.

32:42.240 --> 32:44.960
Get off of the silk, get out of the silk chode.

32:44.960 --> 32:46.560
Let's, oh God, let's, all right,

32:46.560 --> 32:47.960
let's start the money zone.

32:49.480 --> 32:54.480
Hi, I'm Julie Sabatier, host of Rendered.

32:56.920 --> 33:00.240
It's a show about making meaning and breaking rules.

33:00.240 --> 33:02.080
We're answering important questions,

33:02.080 --> 33:05.080
like can you build a spacesuit in your living room?

33:05.080 --> 33:06.840
I went to my brother's place in Beaverton,

33:06.840 --> 33:09.200
and he has a swimming pool, and I pressurized the suit,

33:09.200 --> 33:11.200
and sat down there underwater for about 10 minutes.

33:11.200 --> 33:13.120
The thing that I had built was supporting my life.

33:13.120 --> 33:14.640
That felt really good.

33:14.640 --> 33:17.360
What does it sound like when you play a polka record

33:17.360 --> 33:18.840
through a styrofoam cup?

33:23.640 --> 33:25.960
And what happens when an airport carpet

33:25.960 --> 33:27.800
gains a cult following?

33:27.800 --> 33:31.160
Oh my goodness, the carpet has an Instagram.

33:31.160 --> 33:34.080
Check out Rendered now at MaximumFun.org,

33:34.080 --> 33:36.320
or wherever you like to listen to podcasts.

33:38.920 --> 33:41.080
How about, instead of that, Griffin, how about a Yahoo?

33:41.080 --> 33:42.000
Yeah, sure.

33:42.000 --> 33:44.320
This Yahoo was sent in by Level 9000 Yajur Jujur Davenport.

33:44.320 --> 33:45.160
Thank you, Drew.

33:45.160 --> 33:46.320
It's by Yajur Answers user Justin Bieber,

33:46.320 --> 33:48.160
probably not accurate, who asks,

33:50.000 --> 33:51.520
boxing combinations?

33:52.640 --> 33:56.760
Boxing combos I can use that are unique and cool.

33:58.240 --> 34:00.520
Do you mean like the old one two?

34:00.520 --> 34:02.800
Like the old one two, yeah, I think that's...

34:02.800 --> 34:04.120
The new one two?

34:05.200 --> 34:07.880
Yahoo user Bundini says the very basic combo

34:07.880 --> 34:10.040
is the one two or jab straight.

34:10.040 --> 34:11.680
Doesn't look exciting, but if you can master it,

34:11.680 --> 34:12.960
the timing and accuracy,

34:12.960 --> 34:15.200
it's also the most effective and dangerous.

34:15.200 --> 34:17.480
My favorite though is the three three two,

34:17.480 --> 34:19.760
or the double hook body and head and straight.

34:19.760 --> 34:21.120
Tyson loved throwing it,

34:21.120 --> 34:23.040
and if you have the speed and explosiveness

34:23.040 --> 34:25.600
of Tyson's fist, and I do,

34:26.680 --> 34:28.760
no one would survive it.

34:28.760 --> 34:29.840
Survive it?

34:29.840 --> 34:30.840
Wait, wait, wait.

34:30.840 --> 34:34.920
Sorry, no one would survive your crazy punch combo?

34:34.920 --> 34:37.280
Oh, I've got these just crazy murder hands.

34:37.280 --> 34:40.240
Yeah, and he did, and I do.

34:40.240 --> 34:44.560
I think my favorite combo is the nut nut butthole.

34:44.560 --> 34:45.900
And how does that work, Travis?

34:45.900 --> 34:48.200
You punch the left nut, and then you punch the right nut,

34:48.200 --> 34:50.120
and while they're hunched over, you punch the butthole.

34:50.120 --> 34:53.120
You'd have to get completely around them.

34:53.120 --> 34:54.880
This would be an extremely difficult maneuver

34:54.880 --> 34:55.880
to pull off, Travis.

34:55.880 --> 34:58.160
Listen, I'm not saying, this is not a beginner move.

34:58.160 --> 35:01.480
The precision you would need to isolate each testicle

35:01.480 --> 35:02.760
would be impossible.

35:02.760 --> 35:06.000
This is why I never fight Stretch Armstrong anymore,

35:06.000 --> 35:07.520
because he would always go for that combo.

35:07.520 --> 35:08.360
Can I say something?

35:08.360 --> 35:09.880
If I had to get in a boxing match

35:09.880 --> 35:10.920
against Jeff Probst right now,

35:10.920 --> 35:13.000
I feel like I actually could pull this off,

35:13.000 --> 35:17.320
because I feel like I know that territory so super well.

35:17.320 --> 35:18.940
Better than he knows it himself.

35:18.940 --> 35:21.280
I could punch that shit in like the Konami code,

35:21.280 --> 35:25.520
just using his different areas as the inputs.

35:25.520 --> 35:27.800
Wouldn't boxing be better if they could do

35:27.800 --> 35:31.300
like moves, if they like studied the combos,

35:31.300 --> 35:32.320
and they could like hadouken?

35:32.320 --> 35:33.640
Oh, that would be fucking tight.

35:33.640 --> 35:36.600
If in the Pacquiao Mayweather match,

35:36.600 --> 35:37.980
well, if anything had happened in that match,

35:37.980 --> 35:39.120
it would have been cool.

35:39.120 --> 35:41.160
But if like at one point, like Mayweather's just like,

35:41.160 --> 35:43.200
oh, pretty good fight, yoga fire!

35:43.200 --> 35:44.040
And then spit yoga fire.

35:44.040 --> 35:45.880
Get over here!

35:45.880 --> 35:47.720
Man, that would be tight.

35:47.720 --> 35:50.920
Oh, it seems the champ has been frozen.

35:50.920 --> 35:52.280
Oh, and he shouted.

35:52.280 --> 35:55.160
Okay, well, that's the end of the match.

35:55.160 --> 35:57.760
We'll get him back together for you.

35:57.760 --> 35:58.600
Yeah, that would be good.

35:58.600 --> 36:00.560
Boxing's not my thing.

36:00.560 --> 36:02.480
Have you guys ever just like watched,

36:02.480 --> 36:05.600
sat down for some boxing?

36:05.600 --> 36:08.400
Yeah, I hear it's the most beautiful sport.

36:08.400 --> 36:09.240
It's not.

36:09.240 --> 36:12.080
I think there's a lot of sports more beautiful.

36:12.080 --> 36:13.280
The sweet science.

36:13.280 --> 36:16.040
Sweet science, that's what I was looking for.

36:16.040 --> 36:17.680
The most dangerous game.

36:17.680 --> 36:18.860
The most dangerous game.

36:18.860 --> 36:20.000
Now that I would watch.

36:20.000 --> 36:21.320
You know, it's a weird thing,

36:21.320 --> 36:23.960
because like with most sporting events,

36:23.960 --> 36:26.980
like you know sort of what you're gonna get, right?

36:26.980 --> 36:29.440
Like at least if you're sitting down

36:29.440 --> 36:31.360
to watch something produced by the WWE,

36:31.360 --> 36:33.180
you know you're gonna get showmanship.

36:33.180 --> 36:35.280
You know you're gonna get some drama.

36:35.280 --> 36:37.000
You know you're gonna get some high flying action.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.940
If you're watching a football match,

36:39.940 --> 36:41.560
you know there's gonna be some downs.

36:41.560 --> 36:42.580
There's gonna be passes,

36:42.580 --> 36:45.400
and it's gonna last around two and a half hours-ish.

36:45.400 --> 36:47.200
And even if it's like a low scoring thing,

36:47.200 --> 36:48.700
it's like, oh my God, the defense.

36:48.700 --> 36:49.540
The tension is still there.

36:49.540 --> 36:50.560
Well, there, go!

36:50.560 --> 36:53.840
There are boxing fights

36:53.840 --> 36:56.760
where somebody just punches somebody so hard

36:56.760 --> 36:58.760
that it knocks them out, and that's the end.

36:58.760 --> 37:00.120
They don't wake him back up and say,

37:00.120 --> 37:02.080
hey, people are paying a lot of money for this.

37:02.080 --> 37:02.920
You gotta finish this.

37:02.920 --> 37:04.040
You have to finish it.

37:04.040 --> 37:06.240
I bought a 12 pack of a seasonal micro brew.

37:06.240 --> 37:08.240
I can't wait to have a great evening with it.

37:08.240 --> 37:09.440
All right, bye guys.

37:09.440 --> 37:10.740
And they don't refund you

37:10.740 --> 37:13.480
for the unused portion of the fight.

37:13.480 --> 37:14.760
They don't prorate it.

37:15.920 --> 37:17.640
They should make you go 12 rounds.

37:17.640 --> 37:19.000
Like if you can't-

37:19.000 --> 37:22.240
They prop you up like we get a bird piece in the corner.

37:22.240 --> 37:23.120
If you can't get up,

37:23.120 --> 37:25.440
the guy's just gonna lay on the ground and punch you.

37:25.440 --> 37:26.760
Just keep punching him.

37:26.760 --> 37:28.720
He doesn't have to.

37:28.720 --> 37:29.560
But he could.

37:29.560 --> 37:32.400
He could just lay down beside you and stare at the ceiling.

37:32.400 --> 37:33.240
Does everybody remember he-

37:33.240 --> 37:34.680
But they have to go the whole time.

37:34.680 --> 37:36.560
Everybody remember he laid down first, right?

37:36.560 --> 37:37.680
Okay.

37:37.680 --> 37:39.240
I'm gonna nap now too.

37:39.240 --> 37:41.100
If he wakes up, you wake me up.

37:42.000 --> 37:44.200
I don't want him to punch me all in the sleep.

37:44.200 --> 37:46.840
A knockout should be if the guy counts to 150.

37:46.840 --> 37:48.680
That should be an knockout.

37:48.680 --> 37:49.600
And he doesn't lose track

37:49.600 --> 37:52.960
while there's people throwing numbers at him randomly.

37:52.960 --> 37:55.960
What if there was a crew that they could bring in?

37:55.960 --> 37:58.480
We'll call them a boxing fun time squad.

37:58.480 --> 38:02.480
And if a match lasts 35 seconds, right?

38:02.480 --> 38:05.280
In a Ronda Rousey fight, for example,

38:05.280 --> 38:06.820
which not boxing, but fine.

38:07.680 --> 38:08.640
And then she does her thing,

38:08.640 --> 38:12.200
gets out there 35 seconds down, match is over.

38:12.200 --> 38:14.080
But I've got my crew together.

38:14.080 --> 38:16.640
I worked hard to get my whole squad together.

38:16.640 --> 38:19.000
And I'm trying to hang out and be entertained.

38:19.000 --> 38:20.240
What if there was a fun time squad

38:20.240 --> 38:22.400
that could get out there and do some improv games

38:22.400 --> 38:24.200
for two hours?

38:24.200 --> 38:25.360
Ooh, I like that.

38:25.360 --> 38:26.780
Maybe you get a clown up there

38:26.780 --> 38:28.480
to stand in front of her with a cape.

38:28.480 --> 38:32.400
And she just runs at him and then he hides in a barrel.

38:32.400 --> 38:35.560
What if it was just like, if you go down the next in line,

38:35.560 --> 38:36.840
like now your trainer has to go out.

38:36.840 --> 38:38.260
And if your trainer goes down,

38:38.260 --> 38:40.000
now like your hype man has to go out.

38:40.000 --> 38:41.700
And now your son.

38:43.040 --> 38:44.360
And it's just like succession.

38:44.360 --> 38:45.840
Oh shit, that way when you're fighting,

38:45.840 --> 38:47.600
it's like, I've got to do good in this fight

38:47.600 --> 38:51.240
because I do not want my son in the ring with Tyson.

38:51.240 --> 38:53.280
Cause that, cause then if he goes down,

38:53.280 --> 38:57.800
then my grandkids gonna go in and he's two months old.

38:57.800 --> 38:58.960
And he's terrible.

38:58.960 --> 39:00.600
He hasn't mastered the one, two yet.

39:00.600 --> 39:02.440
No, his three, three, two is good though.

39:02.440 --> 39:05.240
What if after you get knocked out, if it was too early,

39:05.240 --> 39:06.720
after you get knocked out,

39:06.720 --> 39:09.400
like a ring of people dressed exactly like you,

39:09.400 --> 39:11.840
like hop into the ring and encircle the person

39:11.840 --> 39:13.280
like in a Kung Fu movie.

39:13.280 --> 39:14.200
So then you have to like,

39:14.200 --> 39:17.340
you have to take them all on at once to that final challenge.

39:17.340 --> 39:20.680
Well, now they have to fight a shadow version of themselves

39:20.680 --> 39:22.120
and like, so that would be good.

39:22.120 --> 39:23.600
You knocked out Steven,

39:23.600 --> 39:27.180
but now you have to fight yourself, but evil.

39:27.180 --> 39:29.800
And like all your moves are equal.

39:29.800 --> 39:32.660
Maybe after you get knocked out,

39:32.660 --> 39:36.000
you transform into a giant pulsating mass

39:36.000 --> 39:38.600
with one flashing glowing eye in front

39:38.600 --> 39:41.240
and you're shooting lasers and fireballs and stuff.

39:41.240 --> 39:44.040
It seems the challenger has entered his second form.

39:46.520 --> 39:47.360
That would be boxing.

39:47.360 --> 39:48.840
And here's what they don't tell you.

39:48.840 --> 39:50.080
You're supposed to lose that fight.

39:50.080 --> 39:51.560
Yeah, you have to.

39:51.560 --> 39:55.200
Cause then you wake up in like the, you know, in the inn

39:55.200 --> 39:57.680
and it's like, oh, he's rampaging the town.

39:58.840 --> 40:00.320
You must become Dovahkiin.

40:00.320 --> 40:02.600
If you're gonna take on Manny Pacquiao,

40:02.600 --> 40:05.320
you must become the hero you're always meant to be.

40:05.320 --> 40:09.880
Welcome to, be still hero, you're in Mighty Glove Village.

40:09.880 --> 40:14.320
Awaken and take these wooden gloves in preparation.

40:14.320 --> 40:15.600
No, you can't leave the village

40:15.600 --> 40:18.400
until you find steel gloves and a mouth guard.

40:18.400 --> 40:20.360
Unfortunately, your punching shield

40:20.360 --> 40:21.960
was destroyed in the fight.

40:21.960 --> 40:22.800
Well, well, Brian,

40:22.800 --> 40:24.800
it seemed like the over under on that match was way off.

40:24.800 --> 40:26.560
It was much shorter than we thought it was gonna be.

40:26.560 --> 40:28.200
Pacquiao just could not hang in there.

40:28.200 --> 40:32.080
Now we must go collect the seven crystals of legend and-

40:32.080 --> 40:34.040
But first he has to find the missing cat

40:34.040 --> 40:36.840
for the local old woman before he can leave the village.

40:36.840 --> 40:39.240
Do a little bit of grinding in the haunted forest

40:39.240 --> 40:42.920
and just collect the magic sword.

40:42.920 --> 40:45.280
And I think now, now Steve, let me stop you right there.

40:45.280 --> 40:47.600
You cannot bring a sword into the ring.

40:47.600 --> 40:50.280
That is boxing 101, no swords.

40:50.280 --> 40:52.560
It would be an amazing bit of intimidation

40:52.560 --> 40:57.380
if you like lean in and just as the match starts and says,

40:57.380 --> 40:59.640
you should have destroyed my Horcruxes first.

40:59.640 --> 41:00.480
Yeah, sure.

41:01.520 --> 41:02.560
They would just lay down

41:02.560 --> 41:04.240
cause they knew they weren't gonna get it.

41:04.240 --> 41:07.480
I've got the elder wand in my glove.

41:07.480 --> 41:09.340
That's also against the rules.

41:09.340 --> 41:10.180
What?

41:10.180 --> 41:11.400
Hey brothers, my wife is pregnant

41:11.400 --> 41:14.480
and is going to be delivering our daughter in late November.

41:14.480 --> 41:16.920
Apparently they don't let women eat or drink in labor

41:16.920 --> 41:19.240
and I don't want to have to risk her having the baby

41:19.240 --> 41:20.860
in a fast food drive through

41:20.860 --> 41:22.880
on the way to the hospital to get snacks.

41:22.880 --> 41:25.040
What are good snacks to bring during labor?

41:25.040 --> 41:27.800
Her first suggestion was smuggling in a pizza.

41:27.800 --> 41:29.240
A cheese pizza.

41:29.240 --> 41:30.440
Cheese pizza.

41:30.440 --> 41:32.240
And she doesn't listen to you.

41:32.240 --> 41:33.060
So-

41:33.060 --> 41:33.900
Cool.

41:33.900 --> 41:34.740
Cool.

41:34.740 --> 41:36.680
I wish I hadn't done that great goof for you.

41:36.680 --> 41:39.360
So this is a genuine, but maybe she'll hear this bit

41:39.360 --> 41:40.640
cause of course you'll play it for her

41:40.640 --> 41:42.800
and she'll be like, man, I don't like this podcast

41:42.800 --> 41:44.680
but it's a fucking good Tim Curry.

41:44.680 --> 41:48.160
So this is a genuine desire and not a naked Totino's tie-in.

41:48.160 --> 41:49.900
That's from Brandon in South Carolina.

41:49.900 --> 41:50.740
Is that true?

41:50.740 --> 41:53.360
They don't let women eat while they're in labor?

41:53.360 --> 41:54.200
Yeah.

41:54.200 --> 41:55.180
I mean, okay.

41:55.180 --> 41:56.960
The question is a little bit muddled.

41:56.960 --> 41:58.760
I'm trying to follow the logic.

41:58.760 --> 42:01.040
Says they don't let women eat or drink in labor

42:01.040 --> 42:04.040
and he wants to know some good snacks to bring.

42:04.040 --> 42:05.520
Like, is he going to just like-

42:05.520 --> 42:06.360
For you?

42:06.360 --> 42:09.140
Covertly shove a nature's valley into her mouth?

42:09.140 --> 42:10.520
Like what is the-

42:10.520 --> 42:11.480
Baby, he's not looking.

42:11.480 --> 42:12.320
Have these M&Ms.

42:12.320 --> 42:14.800
Maybe you got to take these pills.

42:14.800 --> 42:15.640
Hey, wait a minute.

42:15.640 --> 42:16.800
Those are combos.

42:16.800 --> 42:17.960
Get out of here.

42:17.960 --> 42:20.920
You know, this is my two cents here.

42:20.920 --> 42:23.200
Granted, I've never been in a delivery room

42:23.200 --> 42:26.520
but if the doctor says like, she shouldn't eat

42:26.520 --> 42:28.880
you probably stick with that.

42:28.880 --> 42:32.260
Like I think I know best that my wife wants Doritos.

42:32.260 --> 42:33.120
Is this true?

42:33.120 --> 42:34.200
Like, is this a thing?

42:34.200 --> 42:36.560
Like it seems like a weird incentive

42:36.560 --> 42:40.360
to get labor over quickly, to be like, oh, I'm so hungry.

42:40.360 --> 42:41.840
And you can totally have a sandwich.

42:41.840 --> 42:42.680
Yeah, you want this-

42:42.680 --> 42:43.520
As soon as you're done.

42:43.520 --> 42:44.760
You want this chili dog?

42:46.320 --> 42:47.800
Squeeze that little baby out.

42:48.720 --> 42:50.880
Pop that baby out and you can totally have these Pringles.

42:50.880 --> 42:52.400
I don't know, I think I want to keep this baby

42:52.400 --> 42:53.720
in here for a little while longer.

42:53.720 --> 42:54.920
Oh, are you sure?

42:54.920 --> 42:59.360
Cause I've got this new, they made a new flavor of Pringles

42:59.360 --> 43:01.400
and I've got them.

43:01.400 --> 43:03.480
Maybe that's trying to entice the baby out too.

43:03.480 --> 43:05.840
Like, oh shit, I don't know what Pringles are

43:05.840 --> 43:07.080
but I'm into it.

43:07.080 --> 43:07.920
I bet they-

43:07.920 --> 43:08.960
I just hear a pop.

43:08.960 --> 43:11.400
Oh, then I won't stop, be right there.

43:11.400 --> 43:13.760
I think that babies in the womb actually probably

43:13.760 --> 43:15.000
do know what Pringles are.

43:15.000 --> 43:18.480
So, so great are Pringles that they just-

43:18.480 --> 43:19.720
They've heard about it?

43:19.720 --> 43:21.480
I think they're baked into our DNA.

43:21.480 --> 43:24.080
Like, I think when we come out and we're crying

43:24.080 --> 43:25.400
it's because we haven't had Pringles

43:25.400 --> 43:27.520
for as long as we've existed.

43:27.520 --> 43:28.400
You know what I mean?

43:28.400 --> 43:29.800
And the only way you can shut that up

43:29.800 --> 43:31.200
is to jam a couple of Pringles.

43:31.200 --> 43:34.240
Plus their commercials contain coded ultrasound messages

43:34.240 --> 43:35.080
in Morse code.

43:35.080 --> 43:35.920
True.

43:36.760 --> 43:38.440
A lot of people don't know that.

43:38.440 --> 43:40.640
Yeah, I mean, it's weird, but yeah,

43:40.640 --> 43:42.560
that's like the, that's the scoop.

43:43.600 --> 43:46.680
Now, I think that that's probably something I would guess

43:46.680 --> 43:50.280
and I'm not sure, but we took like our birth training

43:50.280 --> 43:54.560
classes at like a, I don't know what you'd call it.

43:54.560 --> 43:57.400
Like a home birth, a birthing center.

43:57.400 --> 43:58.240
A coven.

43:58.240 --> 43:59.080
A coven.

43:59.080 --> 44:00.520
A coven, there, thank you.

44:00.520 --> 44:03.520
And like, I think they let them eat on the reg

44:03.520 --> 44:05.680
but I'm not, I'm not sure since we didn't actually

44:05.680 --> 44:07.560
go through with it there.

44:07.560 --> 44:10.120
Oh, like at, like the, the-

44:10.120 --> 44:11.840
At the birth center, if it's not, yeah,

44:11.840 --> 44:13.360
like if it's not the hospital, I think they're like,

44:13.360 --> 44:15.120
that's a, that's bullshit.

44:15.120 --> 44:17.720
Oh, so maybe this is just something the hospital cooked up

44:17.720 --> 44:19.640
to save money on like food bills.

44:19.640 --> 44:21.560
Or maybe the doctor had to be in there for a long time

44:21.560 --> 44:24.760
and just didn't want stinky cheese dogs in there

44:24.760 --> 44:26.640
the whole time he was trying to do the baby thing.

44:26.640 --> 44:27.480
He needed to be on focus.

44:27.480 --> 44:28.640
Just give him some Soylent.

44:28.640 --> 44:29.520
Yeah.

44:29.520 --> 44:31.000
It's a meal in a glass.

44:31.000 --> 44:31.840
You know what I mean?

44:31.840 --> 44:32.880
Or some Guinness.

44:32.880 --> 44:34.200
That's not good either.

44:34.200 --> 44:36.480
Maybe mix Soylent into Guinness.

44:36.480 --> 44:39.440
I don't think like beer is a great option,

44:39.440 --> 44:40.400
but it's like bread.

44:40.400 --> 44:42.080
It's like bread in a glass, Justin.

44:42.080 --> 44:42.920
Well, okay.

44:42.920 --> 44:44.480
It's also like baby poison in a glass.

44:44.480 --> 44:45.320
I don't know.

44:45.320 --> 44:47.640
Maybe like, what about non-alcoholic Guinness?

44:47.640 --> 44:48.480
Does that exist?

44:48.480 --> 44:52.640
Yeah, it's called Caliber with a K and it is disgusting.

44:52.640 --> 44:54.680
It tastes like raisins.

44:54.680 --> 44:56.000
Don't get Caliber. Take that, baby.

44:56.000 --> 44:57.120
Take that, baby.

44:57.120 --> 44:58.680
Enjoy this disgusting Caliber.

44:59.920 --> 45:01.080
I think if you get hungry,

45:01.080 --> 45:02.920
I think if you get hungry or thirsty enough,

45:02.920 --> 45:04.200
you'll, you'll drink whatever.

45:04.200 --> 45:07.920
That's how that, what happened in that 156 hours.

45:07.920 --> 45:09.560
The dude like got stuck in the rocks

45:09.560 --> 45:11.240
and then he was like, oh fuck, all I got is Caliber.

45:11.240 --> 45:13.000
Well, I'm gonna dump that right out.

45:14.680 --> 45:17.320
And now I'm gonna cut my arm off so I can eat it.

45:17.320 --> 45:18.160
Mm-hmm.

45:18.160 --> 45:19.080
Is that what happened in that movie?

45:19.080 --> 45:21.160
Yeah, he cuts his arm off and he eats it.

45:21.160 --> 45:22.440
So wait, I do have a question

45:22.440 --> 45:23.600
because I'm never gonna watch that movie.

45:23.600 --> 45:24.440
Yeah.

45:24.440 --> 45:26.360
After he does, and we all know what happens, right?

45:26.360 --> 45:28.240
He cuts his own arm off so he can escape, right?

45:28.240 --> 45:29.600
Or did he?

45:29.600 --> 45:30.440
Or did he?

45:30.440 --> 45:32.280
So like a lot of people aren't sure, I guess.

45:32.280 --> 45:33.640
Griffin had just raised, I don't know.

45:33.640 --> 45:34.920
It's a Jeff Rose did.

45:34.920 --> 45:36.200
I'm saying, I'm saying what I,

45:36.200 --> 45:39.000
the man I saw on the Today Show that one time

45:39.000 --> 45:40.820
looked vaguely holographic.

45:40.820 --> 45:41.660
Okay.

45:41.660 --> 45:46.080
But anyway, so like after he cuts his own arm off,

45:46.080 --> 45:48.920
like does he finish climbing or whatever?

45:48.920 --> 45:50.940
Like he's already there.

45:50.940 --> 45:52.440
Like don't you think he would just like,

45:52.440 --> 45:55.220
well, I'm already here, might as well finish climbing?

45:56.220 --> 45:57.860
No, no.

45:59.120 --> 46:01.480
I mean, what's he get, does he just leave?

46:02.500 --> 46:03.600
Yeah. Yeah.

46:03.600 --> 46:04.440
He just kind of,

46:04.440 --> 46:06.600
that was the whole point of the whole enterprise

46:06.600 --> 46:07.800
of him cutting his arm off.

46:07.800 --> 46:08.840
It's not like he cut his arm off,

46:08.840 --> 46:10.920
was like, cool, now I can sit down.

46:12.600 --> 46:13.560
This is all I needed.

46:13.560 --> 46:17.460
Oh, what a good, what a good sit.

46:21.400 --> 46:22.600
Maybe he just needed a break.

46:22.600 --> 46:24.760
I mean, he's already there.

46:24.760 --> 46:26.020
Okay, I'm done with my sit.

46:26.020 --> 46:28.040
Time to snap back in.

46:28.040 --> 46:30.040
It's from, I don't know where he was climbing,

46:30.040 --> 46:33.040
but what could assume is like a long drive to get there.

46:33.040 --> 46:35.720
Like he's gonna have to drive back out later.

46:35.720 --> 46:37.680
I mean, he had been there for a hundred

46:37.680 --> 46:39.880
and it's like 62 hours.

46:39.880 --> 46:41.920
I feel like he'd gotten his money's worth.

46:41.920 --> 46:43.160
Yeah.

46:43.160 --> 46:44.080
You know what I regret?

46:44.080 --> 46:44.900
You know what?

46:44.900 --> 46:45.840
I'm gonna pop my other arm in there.

46:45.840 --> 46:46.900
I'm not ready to go.

46:48.440 --> 46:49.840
There's still more fun to be had.

46:49.840 --> 46:52.200
What if as he was climbing,

46:52.200 --> 46:53.920
he like reached for the same spot

46:53.920 --> 46:55.160
with the arm that he had cut off

46:55.160 --> 46:56.200
and it just like swung past.

46:56.200 --> 46:57.360
He was like, ah, ah, ah.

46:57.360 --> 46:58.480
Not today.

46:58.480 --> 46:59.320
Not this time, you little bitch.

46:59.320 --> 47:01.640
Have you guys seen 386 hours?

47:01.640 --> 47:04.360
It's this crazy movie where this guy gets his arm stuck,

47:04.360 --> 47:06.720
cuts it off, incinerates it, has an arm jar.

47:06.720 --> 47:08.120
He's like, ah, you know what?

47:09.120 --> 47:09.960
You know what?

47:11.120 --> 47:15.920
What you've been listening to is I think a 100%

47:15.920 --> 47:18.200
authentic recreation of the first meeting

47:18.200 --> 47:19.920
with James Franco about this film.

47:19.920 --> 47:20.760
Yeah.

47:20.760 --> 47:22.240
Like guaranteed he was pitching this.

47:22.240 --> 47:23.720
Like Ash, you should just go back up.

47:23.720 --> 47:25.080
He's already there.

47:25.080 --> 47:26.120
I have another Yahoo.

47:26.120 --> 47:27.760
This one, wow, shit.

47:27.760 --> 47:29.640
I promise I didn't plan this, but it's a hat trick.

47:29.640 --> 47:31.960
Yeah, Drew, Drew, dude, I have a board, thank you, Drew.

47:31.960 --> 47:34.720
It's by, yeah, Drew answers user.

47:34.720 --> 47:36.120
Oh, it's anonymous.

47:36.120 --> 47:37.800
Shit.

47:37.800 --> 47:40.300
Let's call him the Highlander.

47:41.240 --> 47:42.420
The Highlander asks,

47:44.760 --> 47:47.480
does anyone know how to curse a real sword?

47:49.920 --> 47:50.760
Details?

47:50.760 --> 47:51.600
None.

47:51.600 --> 47:52.440
None details.

47:52.440 --> 47:53.880
None.

47:53.880 --> 47:55.600
A real sword?

47:55.600 --> 47:56.440
Yeah.

47:56.440 --> 47:57.280
Ugh.

47:59.360 --> 48:00.200
As opposed to-

48:00.200 --> 48:03.580
A real, like with an edge and metal and what all.

48:03.580 --> 48:04.420
Yeah.

48:04.420 --> 48:05.700
Yeah.

48:05.700 --> 48:07.980
Just your typical real sword.

48:07.980 --> 48:08.820
Yes.

48:08.820 --> 48:10.040
Fight quality?

48:10.040 --> 48:11.840
Doesn't say, doesn't say.

48:11.840 --> 48:15.940
Just like a real, like curse like a nerf sword?

48:15.940 --> 48:17.940
Does he want to curse a nerf sword?

48:17.940 --> 48:19.640
I mean, a nerf sword is real,

48:19.640 --> 48:24.280
but I think the real in this subject is modifying sword.

48:24.280 --> 48:27.680
So like a real, like fighting sword.

48:27.680 --> 48:29.520
A real sword, ugh.

48:29.520 --> 48:31.940
Do you know how to curse a nerf sword?

48:31.940 --> 48:34.320
Eh, gosh, a real sword?

48:38.680 --> 48:39.720
Had to be real, didn't it?

48:39.720 --> 48:40.560
Yeah, that's the-

48:40.560 --> 48:43.060
Drew, couldn't you just take your nerf sword curse

48:43.060 --> 48:44.400
and like use it on the sword?

48:44.400 --> 48:45.600
Yeah.

48:45.600 --> 48:46.600
Which sword?

48:46.600 --> 48:47.420
The real sword.

48:47.420 --> 48:48.740
A real sword, ugh.

48:50.320 --> 48:53.260
Cursing a real sword, ugh, gosh.

48:53.260 --> 48:56.520
A real sword.

48:56.520 --> 48:57.360
Can I ask-

48:57.360 --> 48:59.660
What about a, can I interest you in a cursed,

49:00.600 --> 49:02.160
wait, what did you want?

49:02.160 --> 49:03.000
Real sword.

49:03.000 --> 49:04.520
Ugh, gosh.

49:04.520 --> 49:06.440
A real one.

49:08.240 --> 49:09.860
Ah, crap.

49:09.860 --> 49:10.800
This is great, this is great,

49:10.800 --> 49:12.240
because I felt like I was kind of running on empty

49:12.240 --> 49:13.560
coming into the end of the episode.

49:13.560 --> 49:15.640
I was just like looking for something like this

49:15.640 --> 49:17.460
to just sort of coast in on.

49:17.460 --> 49:18.760
What's the date?

49:18.760 --> 49:21.140
It's September 4th when we're recording this.

49:21.140 --> 49:23.920
Roughly what time in, is it?

49:23.920 --> 49:24.760
About five.

49:25.660 --> 49:28.080
About five, okay.

49:28.080 --> 49:29.160
Whose time zone?

49:29.160 --> 49:30.120
Yours.

49:30.120 --> 49:31.640
And what kind of sword?

49:31.640 --> 49:32.480
Very real.

49:32.480 --> 49:37.480
Ugh, gosh, oof, um, mm, ugh.

49:39.300 --> 49:40.120
I wanna-

49:40.120 --> 49:41.960
Gosh, a real sword, is this a curse?

49:41.960 --> 49:44.280
Can I ask what's bothering you so much about this?

49:44.280 --> 49:46.040
I mean, do you have experience cursing

49:46.040 --> 49:47.880
like a decorative sword or like-

49:47.880 --> 49:50.200
Or like blessing a real sword but not cursing it?

49:50.200 --> 49:51.240
Like it seems like you're upset about

49:51.240 --> 49:53.280
literally every word in this sentence.

49:54.360 --> 49:55.920
What did you want to happen to the real,

49:55.920 --> 49:57.320
like I got the real sword,

49:57.320 --> 49:59.620
like I see you have a real sword that you brought with you.

49:59.620 --> 50:01.840
What did you, like clarify for me

50:01.840 --> 50:03.080
what exactly you want to happen?

50:03.080 --> 50:04.440
We wanted to curse it.

50:04.440 --> 50:05.500
Curse what?

50:05.500 --> 50:06.340
A real sword.

50:06.340 --> 50:07.180
Ugh, gosh.

50:07.180 --> 50:09.120
Can you, can you enchant-

50:09.120 --> 50:09.960
This is a tough thing.

50:09.960 --> 50:12.040
Yeah, can you enchant a real sword?

50:12.040 --> 50:13.360
Enchant it with what?

50:13.360 --> 50:14.720
Magic?

50:14.720 --> 50:16.960
Yeah, but what kind of enchantment are you wanting?

50:16.960 --> 50:17.800
Fire.

50:17.800 --> 50:18.640
We'll say fire.

50:18.640 --> 50:19.720
Like fire.

50:19.720 --> 50:21.760
Well, a fire enchantment on a real sword

50:21.760 --> 50:23.360
is that, that's no problem at all.

50:23.360 --> 50:24.200
You knocked that out.

50:24.200 --> 50:25.680
You knocked that out over the weekend.

50:25.680 --> 50:26.520
Do that.

50:26.520 --> 50:27.340
Yeah, I'll do that, man.

50:27.340 --> 50:28.680
But what about, so just take that

50:28.680 --> 50:30.480
and like curse the real sword.

50:31.880 --> 50:32.720
Ugh!

50:32.720 --> 50:35.360
Yeah, but I know, I know, I know, I know, I know.

50:35.360 --> 50:36.200
Think about it, think about it this way.

50:36.200 --> 50:38.520
Think about the sweat equity that you're building.

50:38.520 --> 50:40.440
People buy swords and they just put them off on the shelf

50:40.440 --> 50:41.520
and they think like, oh, that's gonna,

50:41.520 --> 50:43.880
that's gonna increase in value.

50:43.880 --> 50:46.960
But it's not because the sword needs to be honed.

50:46.960 --> 50:47.800
You know what I mean?

50:47.800 --> 50:48.960
It needs to be used.

50:48.960 --> 50:52.520
Or in this case, it needs to be enchanted with dark magics.

50:52.520 --> 50:54.940
And if you do that, you're gonna be able to resell this

50:54.940 --> 50:58.200
for God, I don't know, 50 to 100% profit.

50:58.200 --> 51:00.380
Depends on the curse too, and the sword.

51:01.480 --> 51:06.100
Yeah, I mean, I would think depending on the kind of sword

51:06.100 --> 51:09.200
that you're wanting to curse, it could be really easy.

51:09.200 --> 51:10.600
Or it could be really difficult.

51:10.600 --> 51:12.000
It depends on the type of sword

51:12.000 --> 51:13.640
that you're wanting to put the curse on.

51:13.640 --> 51:14.800
What about a scimitar?

51:16.240 --> 51:17.440
A real scimitar.

51:17.440 --> 51:20.600
Ah, that is tough.

51:21.680 --> 51:22.520
$100.

51:23.600 --> 51:25.200
That wasn't even the question.

51:25.200 --> 51:28.400
The question was, does anyone know how to curse a real sword?

51:28.400 --> 51:30.440
Not how much would it cost Justin McElroy

51:30.440 --> 51:31.720
to curse my real sword.

51:33.400 --> 51:34.320
Wait, what did you want to curse?

51:34.320 --> 51:37.560
I'm so mad you didn't stick the dismount.

51:37.560 --> 51:39.480
You flipped in the air for 20 minutes.

51:39.480 --> 51:41.100
You didn't stick the landing.

51:41.100 --> 51:46.100
A real sword.

51:47.880 --> 51:49.300
$200.

51:49.300 --> 51:50.520
Why did it increase?

51:51.660 --> 51:52.860
You wasted my time, kid.

51:52.860 --> 51:54.860
Okay, all right.

51:54.860 --> 51:57.620
Are you gonna curse this fucking sword for me or not?

51:57.620 --> 51:59.740
I will if you keep your voice down.

51:59.740 --> 52:02.300
Wait, I also need you to buy some of these unicorn figures.

52:02.300 --> 52:03.900
Wait, is it a fucking sword?

52:03.900 --> 52:06.940
Because that I can curse, that's no problem.

52:06.940 --> 52:10.540
As long as it is not, gosh, I can't even say it.

52:10.540 --> 52:11.380
Yeah.

52:11.380 --> 52:12.220
Real?

52:12.220 --> 52:13.040
Real?

52:13.040 --> 52:13.880
Ooh.

52:13.880 --> 52:15.860
$300.

52:15.860 --> 52:17.380
I don't, I'm leaving.

52:17.380 --> 52:19.060
I'm leaving this store.

52:19.060 --> 52:22.860
This is a bad store run by business,

52:22.860 --> 52:24.900
not business minded people.

52:24.900 --> 52:26.660
Well, I have some bad news for you.

52:26.660 --> 52:27.580
What's that?

52:27.580 --> 52:30.180
It's a Starbucks and you've been dead the whole time.

52:30.180 --> 52:31.020
What?

52:31.020 --> 52:32.740
Twist, Shyamalan.

52:32.740 --> 52:34.080
Why do I have a sword?

52:35.260 --> 52:36.100
Do you?

52:36.100 --> 52:36.940
Look at it right in.

52:36.940 --> 52:40.140
Holy shit, this is not a real sword at all.

52:40.140 --> 52:43.220
That's one of our new sausage and gouda sandwiches.

52:43.220 --> 52:44.060
They're new this week.

52:44.060 --> 52:45.920
Can you curse this for me?

52:45.920 --> 52:47.340
Yeah, no problem.

52:47.340 --> 52:48.340
How much is that?

52:49.620 --> 52:50.460
How much is what?

52:50.460 --> 52:53.220
Cursing my sandwich.

52:53.220 --> 52:54.460
Oh, that comes free with the purchase.

52:54.460 --> 52:55.540
Oh, fuck yeah.

52:55.540 --> 52:56.380
Yeah, do it.

52:56.380 --> 52:57.200
No problem.

52:57.200 --> 52:58.040
Can you toast it?

52:58.040 --> 52:58.860
Yeah, okay.

52:58.860 --> 52:59.700
Is it, wait, hold on, stop.

52:59.700 --> 53:00.540
Wait, wait, wait.

53:00.540 --> 53:01.360
Stop, hold on, wait, wait, hold on, stop.

53:01.360 --> 53:05.680
Are you, in your mind, when you toast something,

53:05.680 --> 53:06.740
and this is very important,

53:06.740 --> 53:07.820
I should have asked this up front.

53:07.820 --> 53:10.740
When you toast something, do you refer to that

53:10.740 --> 53:12.500
as cursing it?

53:12.500 --> 53:13.340
Yes.

53:13.340 --> 53:17.580
Now, when you say sausage and gouda sandwich,

53:17.580 --> 53:19.340
are you referring to a real sword?

53:19.340 --> 53:21.660
No, no, it's a real sandwich.

53:21.660 --> 53:23.500
Okay, that's no problem.

53:23.500 --> 53:26.160
In the morning times, you say,

53:26.160 --> 53:28.220
I know what I'll have, a little breakfast time treat.

53:28.220 --> 53:29.780
I'm gonna curse some waffles.

53:31.100 --> 53:33.260
Give them the curse of incineration.

53:33.260 --> 53:34.780
Okay.

53:34.780 --> 53:36.540
You know what, I will have that on my sword.

53:36.540 --> 53:37.980
Thank you.

53:37.980 --> 53:38.820
Have what?

53:40.400 --> 53:41.840
Thank you all for listening to my brother.

53:41.840 --> 53:45.180
My brother and me, that was our who's on first.

53:45.180 --> 53:47.300
We're gonna break that out into a little cassingle.

53:47.300 --> 53:49.920
Gonna stamp that on the vinyl.

53:49.920 --> 53:51.120
We'll have people sign that.

53:51.120 --> 53:52.100
We'll sign that for folks.

53:52.100 --> 53:55.780
Just come to our shows, bring our cursed sword single,

53:55.780 --> 53:59.880
and we'll make sure to, you won't leave unhappy.

53:59.880 --> 54:02.960
Can I just say, somebody out there,

54:02.960 --> 54:07.820
one person just found their favorite bit of all time.

54:07.820 --> 54:08.700
I think, can I say that?

54:08.700 --> 54:10.060
I think it was fucking you.

54:11.460 --> 54:12.860
I think it was Carl Reiner.

54:12.860 --> 54:16.700
Carl Reiner thought that was a real good goof.

54:17.860 --> 54:19.020
We wanna say thank you to everybody

54:19.020 --> 54:21.380
who came out to our live show tour

54:21.380 --> 54:22.660
in the Pacific Northwest.

54:22.660 --> 54:25.680
It was amazing, and everybody was incredible,

54:25.680 --> 54:28.100
and Seattle and Portland and Vancouver,

54:28.100 --> 54:29.260
you're all super nice,

54:29.260 --> 54:31.760
and we really appreciated the warm welcome,

54:31.760 --> 54:34.260
except for Vancouver, where it rained a bunch

54:34.260 --> 54:35.820
and most people didn't have power,

54:35.820 --> 54:38.260
so it wasn't really that warm, but we still appreciate it.

54:38.260 --> 54:40.660
And the welcome was warm.

54:40.660 --> 54:43.220
I have 20 Canadian dollars with me still,

54:43.220 --> 54:46.140
so if anybody wants to swap, put me know.

54:47.480 --> 54:49.860
We also wanna say we've got another live show coming up

54:49.860 --> 54:50.980
in just a few weeks.

54:50.980 --> 54:54.480
We're doing LA PodFest this year.

54:54.480 --> 54:55.320
Now, here's the thing.

54:55.320 --> 54:56.160
You might be sitting there going,

54:56.160 --> 54:57.740
but I'm not in Los Angeles.

54:57.740 --> 54:58.700
Good news.

54:58.700 --> 55:03.700
If you go to LAPodFest.com and click on live stream,

55:04.140 --> 55:06.860
you can watch a live My Brother, My Brother, Me

55:06.860 --> 55:11.860
and the first ever live adventure zone from anywhere,

55:12.120 --> 55:17.120
and it's only $25, but if you use the code zone or brother,

55:17.340 --> 55:20.180
either one, you can watch it for $20,

55:20.180 --> 55:23.860
you save five bucks, and you help support our show.

55:23.860 --> 55:28.100
And the whole thing, you can watch all the shows,

55:28.100 --> 55:29.700
not just My Brother, My Brother and Me,

55:29.700 --> 55:31.980
and Adventure Zone, but Stuff You Should Know

55:31.980 --> 55:35.180
is gonna be there, Indoor Kids is gonna be there,

55:35.180 --> 55:36.940
and there's a ton of other ones.

55:36.940 --> 55:40.960
Speaking of, Stuff You Should Know comes on right after us,

55:40.960 --> 55:42.660
so if you're going to be at the live show,

55:42.660 --> 55:43.500
stick around, watch their show too.

55:43.500 --> 55:46.220
I think, is Indoor Kids doing right before us?

55:46.220 --> 55:47.060
That is correct. That's gonna be

55:47.060 --> 55:48.340
a fucking power play.

55:48.340 --> 55:50.860
That's gonna be a good set, y'all.

55:50.860 --> 55:51.820
It's a huge lineup.

55:51.820 --> 55:55.340
So go to LAPodFest.com, click on live stream,

55:55.340 --> 55:57.540
use the code zone or brother.

55:57.540 --> 55:59.280
I wanna thank John Roderick in the long winters

55:59.280 --> 56:00.120
for the use of our theme song

56:00.120 --> 56:01.660
as a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

56:01.660 --> 56:03.340
If you didn't listen to last week's episode,

56:03.340 --> 56:06.420
because it was live, you should at least listen

56:06.420 --> 56:08.100
to the first minute and a half of it,

56:08.100 --> 56:09.940
because he played our intro for us,

56:09.940 --> 56:11.340
and he was super cool.

56:11.340 --> 56:12.980
He's a really super great dude.

56:12.980 --> 56:14.780
Thank you, thank you, John.

56:14.780 --> 56:16.740
That video's up too.

56:16.740 --> 56:18.580
If you look at our Twitter, we retweeted it.

56:18.580 --> 56:21.420
Yeah. Yeah, and I've, Jeremy.

56:21.420 --> 56:23.020
Frank. Our friend Jeremy

56:23.020 --> 56:24.180
filmed the whole thing,

56:24.180 --> 56:26.740
so I've got the whole Seattle live show on video.

56:26.740 --> 56:29.380
I'll be putting that up in chunks pretty soon.

56:29.380 --> 56:30.700
Oh, speaking of which,

56:30.700 --> 56:32.540
if anybody happened to do that

56:32.540 --> 56:36.220
for the Portland show, will you please holler at your boy?

56:36.220 --> 56:40.380
We talked about that in the interstitial.

56:40.380 --> 56:42.020
Yeah, we lost Portland.

56:42.020 --> 56:43.460
I've seen a few people on Twitter.

56:43.460 --> 56:44.900
It seems like a mixed reaction.

56:44.900 --> 56:46.860
A lot of people who were at that show are bummed

56:46.860 --> 56:50.260
that the show they went to isn't going to exist ever,

56:50.260 --> 56:54.100
but there are a lot of people who now think of themselves

56:54.100 --> 56:57.220
as the recipients of this rare gift

56:57.220 --> 56:59.420
that it was an okay show.

56:59.420 --> 57:00.260
It was a pretty good show.

57:00.260 --> 57:02.820
I guess it's the kind of show that you'd be happy to be

57:02.820 --> 57:04.940
one of 600 people to listen to.

57:04.940 --> 57:09.220
What I think we should do is post what we have,

57:09.220 --> 57:11.220
maybe not on the feed, maybe just for download,

57:11.220 --> 57:15.220
and let people record what they think Travis is saying

57:15.220 --> 57:16.620
in any given moment.

57:16.620 --> 57:18.380
Oh, everyone can do their own Sad Lib.

57:18.380 --> 57:19.880
Exactly, it's like a Sad Lib

57:19.880 --> 57:21.780
where you're filling in for Travis.

57:21.780 --> 57:26.780
You get to be, we're gonna call it the jokes on you.

57:26.780 --> 57:28.260
Oh shit, that's good.

57:28.260 --> 57:29.580
I like that. Thank you.

57:29.580 --> 57:32.740
So you're gonna record a full episode

57:32.740 --> 57:34.220
where you're just sitting with Travis,

57:34.220 --> 57:37.060
and it's gotta dovetail as nicely as possible,

57:37.060 --> 57:39.420
and I don't know what you should do with it then.

57:39.420 --> 57:40.700
I hope their jokes aren't better than mine.

57:40.700 --> 57:42.440
What if we did it as a contest,

57:42.440 --> 57:44.540
and then we actually release that episode?

57:45.560 --> 57:48.180
Yes, that is an excellent idea.

57:48.180 --> 57:50.040
Yes, that's an excellent idea.

57:50.040 --> 57:54.740
Speaking of contests, the MBMJAM game jam

57:54.740 --> 57:56.140
has been extended.

57:56.140 --> 57:58.460
I think the new deadline is September 13th,

57:58.460 --> 57:59.660
if I'm not mistaken.

57:59.660 --> 58:04.660
Go to MBMJAM.com and check out all the details there.

58:05.900 --> 58:07.380
It's not too late, go do it.

58:07.380 --> 58:08.560
Davenport's been tweeting at us,

58:08.560 --> 58:12.820
pictures of him making shit on the original PSX RPG maker,

58:12.820 --> 58:17.420
and it has been giving me the craziest nostalgia

58:17.420 --> 58:20.140
I've probably ever experienced in my entire life,

58:20.140 --> 58:22.940
because I put maybe 150 hours into that game.

58:22.940 --> 58:24.380
Oh, RPG maker, I miss you so.

58:24.380 --> 58:25.760
Are we done?

58:25.760 --> 58:26.600
I think so.

58:26.600 --> 58:29.460
Speaking of Drew Davenport, four in one show.

58:29.460 --> 58:30.500
Has that ever happened before?

58:30.500 --> 58:31.340
Probably.

58:31.340 --> 58:32.160
It's amazing.

58:32.160 --> 58:33.000
Yeah.

58:33.000 --> 58:33.820
Thank you, Drew.

58:33.820 --> 58:38.820
It's by Yadru user, Sincaivu.

58:38.820 --> 58:41.300
Sincaivu asks,

58:41.300 --> 58:46.300
is Dakota Fanning still alive?

58:49.300 --> 58:50.900
I'm Justin McElroy.

58:50.900 --> 58:51.740
I'm Travis McElroy.

58:51.740 --> 58:53.140
I'm Griffin McElroy.

58:53.140 --> 58:54.060
He's been my brother, my brother,

58:54.060 --> 58:56.360
and may you kiss your dad's square on the lips.

58:56.360 --> 59:23.860
And we host a show about being new moms.

59:23.860 --> 59:26.060
Have you ever pretended to be a sleeping rock

59:26.060 --> 59:28.340
to make your three-year-old play by yourself?

59:28.340 --> 59:29.500
How about scream singing

59:29.500 --> 59:31.740
to make yourself think you aren't screaming?

59:31.740 --> 59:35.060
You're singing really, really loud!

59:35.060 --> 59:37.620
