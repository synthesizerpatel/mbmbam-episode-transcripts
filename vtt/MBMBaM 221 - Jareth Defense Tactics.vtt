00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:46.560
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me,

00:46.560 --> 00:50.560
an advice show for the modern era. I'm your baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

00:50.560 --> 00:56.400
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy. And joining us today, this is very exciting,

00:56.400 --> 01:03.040
very special guest, beloved J-pop hologram pop star, Hatsune Miku.

01:03.760 --> 01:05.440
I'm Hatsune Miku.

01:06.480 --> 01:12.080
Hatsune Miku, thank you for being here. I feel like your holographic nature is maybe lost

01:12.080 --> 01:16.400
based on the nature of our visual medium, but can you in fact confirm for us that you are

01:16.400 --> 01:18.240
a projected light specter?

01:19.040 --> 01:22.320
I am. I am being projected onto the wall.

01:22.320 --> 01:24.560
What in the whole shit?

01:24.560 --> 01:31.760
Um, it's me, Hatsune Miku, fresh from my performance on the David Letterman program.

01:32.400 --> 01:33.520
So happy to be here.

01:33.520 --> 01:37.840
Is this your spe- okay, I've only heard your vocaloid singing performances.

01:37.840 --> 01:41.360
Is this just your speaking voice? Can you confirm that for me hologram now?

01:42.080 --> 01:47.520
Yes, this is how I talk, and this is how I sing.

01:47.520 --> 01:50.080
Griffin, can I talk with you over here for a moment?

01:50.080 --> 01:52.480
Yes, go ahead about your business.

01:52.480 --> 01:58.080
Hatsune, you sit down. I made you some oolong that you just absolutely can enjoy because

01:58.080 --> 02:01.120
you're all light. I'm going to have a sidebar with my brother here. What's up, Trav?

02:01.680 --> 02:04.240
Griffin, what the fuck is going on?

02:04.880 --> 02:06.240
Oh, Hatsune Miku.

02:06.240 --> 02:08.720
I missed one pre-production meeting.

02:09.600 --> 02:13.760
You missed one very important momentous episode of the David Letterman

02:13.760 --> 02:19.040
late night television program, and you're just- you don't have any cultural touchstones anymore.

02:19.040 --> 02:22.160
Hatsune, I am so sorry to bother you. I don't know how you're drinking that,

02:22.160 --> 02:23.520
but I also don't know how you-

02:23.520 --> 02:26.960
I'm just making a puddle. It's just a puddle on the floor.

02:26.960 --> 02:27.200
Okay.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.280
Where's Justin?

02:29.280 --> 02:32.560
I am using him as my corporeal projector.

02:32.560 --> 02:33.680
Oh, shit.

02:33.680 --> 02:42.000
I'm a hologram based on a vocaloid. It's real confusing for you gaijins, but-

02:42.000 --> 02:46.480
Not for me. I just want to say up front that I'm a big, big, big fan.

02:46.480 --> 02:52.320
Yeah, but I have to have a human to project my spectral pop star form,

02:52.320 --> 02:56.080
so I basically just rigged him up as a projector.

02:56.080 --> 03:01.760
And then after you leave your frame, that person dies in 15 minutes.

03:01.760 --> 03:05.280
He will be dead in 15 minutes.

03:05.280 --> 03:07.440
That's a bummer. It's real sad.

03:07.440 --> 03:11.360
Can you- are you- I don't- man, it's really hard to frame this question without being rude.

03:11.360 --> 03:12.000
Are you sick?

03:12.880 --> 03:13.120
What?

03:14.400 --> 03:14.800
I'm just-

03:14.800 --> 03:16.640
Yeah, well, I got the clap.

03:16.640 --> 03:18.400
No, I meant- oh, Jesus.

03:18.400 --> 03:23.920
I meant, like, do you have perhaps a laryngitic illness?

03:23.920 --> 03:28.080
I am a computer program, so you have a virus.

03:29.200 --> 03:31.120
You're next. You're my- I just picked my next projector.

03:31.120 --> 03:32.640
Oh, shit. Great.

03:32.640 --> 03:33.680
Good one for you.

03:35.040 --> 03:37.760
See that movie Annabelle? I'm like that.

03:37.760 --> 03:38.400
It's not like that.

03:38.400 --> 03:39.600
Except they're the hologram.

03:39.600 --> 03:42.480
Sure. Quick question. How was it-

03:42.480 --> 03:47.600
Because obviously, just sort of looking at David Letterman's flop sweats the entire time

03:47.600 --> 03:51.680
that you were doing your shits up there, he did not seem especially,

03:52.720 --> 03:54.480
especially comfortable with the arrangement.

03:54.480 --> 03:58.000
I think- I think the only thing he said afterwards was,

03:58.000 --> 04:02.400
there she is, which is arguably the most uncomfortable thing.

04:02.400 --> 04:07.120
I gotta say- I mean, he announced his retirement.

04:07.120 --> 04:10.240
I think upon seeing me, there was a very clear moment

04:10.240 --> 04:12.800
where he realized I've stayed too long.

04:12.800 --> 04:13.200
Yeah.

04:13.200 --> 04:18.000
I am at that point where I'm introducing a hologram.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.080
I've stayed- I've stayed too long.

04:20.080 --> 04:24.880
He walked out of the studio and immediately threw himself into a tar pit.

04:24.880 --> 04:26.560
Just like, I'm ready now.

04:26.560 --> 04:27.840
I'm ready now. I'm done.

04:28.880 --> 04:30.240
Was it uncomfortable for you?

04:30.960 --> 04:35.040
I mean, I'm literally just a computer program.

04:35.760 --> 04:37.760
Nothing is uncomfortable for me.

04:37.760 --> 04:41.360
So no, I had a fine time.

04:41.360 --> 04:44.640
They had some great treats in the green room.

04:45.440 --> 04:46.400
Like, like EXE's?

04:46.400 --> 04:47.760
Yeah, there were EXE's that I just know me.

04:47.760 --> 04:49.040
Delicious Executables?

04:49.040 --> 04:49.280
Okay.

04:49.280 --> 04:49.680
Delicious Executables.

04:49.680 --> 04:51.840
What the fuck is going on?

04:51.840 --> 04:56.160
I just wish that you paid closer attention to pop culture.

04:56.720 --> 04:58.880
I pay attention to life, Griffin.

04:58.880 --> 04:59.760
Yeah, I guess so.

05:01.200 --> 05:02.640
Well, I'm gonna release this guy.

05:02.640 --> 05:03.440
Okay.

05:03.440 --> 05:06.400
I got a show in Cleveland I gotta start.

05:06.400 --> 05:09.120
I gotta plug in and juice up for.

05:10.720 --> 05:12.160
Oh man, that was good soup.

05:13.040 --> 05:14.480
How are you eating soup?

05:15.040 --> 05:16.080
I'm just puddling it.

05:18.960 --> 05:20.080
It makes me gassy.

05:21.440 --> 05:22.640
Thank you for being on the show.

05:22.640 --> 05:24.960
Thank you for inhabiting and then killing Paul Schaefer.

05:25.520 --> 05:26.720
It was a real joy to have you.

05:27.600 --> 05:29.120
Yeah, but yeah, my pleasure.

05:30.320 --> 05:31.040
Where's my ride?

05:32.000 --> 05:33.680
Oh, it's right here.

05:33.680 --> 05:36.640
I have a torrent waiting for you.

05:36.640 --> 05:39.440
Into the music Versaio.

05:43.600 --> 05:44.400
Justin, you all right?

05:45.360 --> 05:46.160
Yeah, I'm fine.

05:46.160 --> 05:47.600
I thought I would die.

05:47.600 --> 05:47.840
Yeah.

05:48.960 --> 05:50.160
But I didn't.

05:50.160 --> 05:50.800
So that's good.

05:51.440 --> 05:52.400
It is good.

05:52.400 --> 05:54.560
You missed probably our best bit ever though.

05:54.560 --> 05:58.160
So that's certainly the one that has engaged Travis the most.

05:58.160 --> 05:59.680
I think we can all agree on that.

05:59.680 --> 06:02.560
Yeah, Trav, you should have said when we were pitching this,

06:02.560 --> 06:06.240
when we were like we're going to make all kinds of really great Hatsune Miku jokes.

06:07.280 --> 06:12.240
Normally what one does in like the comedy structure is take on the role of the

06:13.200 --> 06:16.480
know-nothing who asked to be educated about the thing.

06:17.840 --> 06:22.480
Maybe you've seen Who's On First where one guy knows about the thing and the other guy

06:22.480 --> 06:24.240
asks questions about the thing and he's confused about the thing.

06:24.240 --> 06:30.960
Travis has decided to take a different approach where he just pumps, opens up the silence fire

06:30.960 --> 06:32.880
hose and pumps it right into his mic.

06:33.840 --> 06:36.560
Well, I didn't realize I was supposed to be the know-nothing.

06:36.560 --> 06:38.080
I just thought I was the say-nothing.

06:38.880 --> 06:39.760
So I went with that.

06:40.560 --> 06:40.880
Sure.

06:42.000 --> 06:47.040
You represent the flyover states regarding Hatsune Miku.

06:47.760 --> 06:49.680
I also was checking Twitter, so.

06:49.680 --> 06:50.640
God damn it.

06:51.280 --> 06:56.960
When people give birthday, Christmas, Valentine cards and such, when is it okay to throw them

06:56.960 --> 06:57.360
away?

06:57.360 --> 07:00.240
We all know the cards will get thrown away eventually.

07:00.240 --> 07:06.720
Should we throw them away in front of the giver after searching it for cash or perhaps

07:06.720 --> 07:10.640
just cross the name out and regift it as an eco-friendly gesture?

07:11.360 --> 07:12.960
That's from Hoarding Hallmark.

07:13.920 --> 07:18.640
Is this a- I was thinking about this the other day because we moved and we brought a bunch

07:18.640 --> 07:19.680
of cards with us.

07:19.680 --> 07:20.160
Some from-

07:20.160 --> 07:20.640
Why?

07:21.440 --> 07:25.120
Well, some were like from our wedding and some like I found a couple birthday cards

07:25.120 --> 07:26.560
from like grandparents and shit.

07:26.560 --> 07:31.760
And my question was, it seems like a thing, like I remember growing up, we had that like

07:31.760 --> 07:36.240
box of Christmas cards that like came out every year and just got added to and added

07:36.240 --> 07:36.960
to.

07:36.960 --> 07:40.320
Did people like used to save these things forever?

07:41.120 --> 07:43.520
Like it ended up with boxes and boxes of hallmarks?

07:44.240 --> 07:44.960
Yeah, I think so.

07:44.960 --> 07:48.720
I think what it was used as like the way you kept in touch with people, it was a lot more

07:48.720 --> 07:49.840
important to save them.

07:49.840 --> 07:56.000
I have a pretty strict rule now where I will hold on to it for one week and then I will

07:56.000 --> 08:01.840
hold on to it for one week for every word that has been written on the card.

08:01.840 --> 08:06.800
So if it's very like a- it's a very sweet card that someone is taking the time to write

08:06.800 --> 08:09.280
a very personalized message in, I'll save it for longer.

08:09.280 --> 08:15.520
If it's just like, B-Day, crushed it, love Nani, then I don't feel the need to keep

08:15.520 --> 08:17.520
that for more than a month or so.

08:17.520 --> 08:22.960
I think if you got a card from Nani that said B-Day, crushed it, you would fucking take

08:22.960 --> 08:24.240
that to the grave.

08:24.240 --> 08:25.840
Yeah, that's probably true.

08:25.840 --> 08:27.920
Buried with it like a pharaoh.

08:27.920 --> 08:33.520
It would be my payment to Styx to cross the river Styx.

08:33.520 --> 08:35.200
Oh yeah, this is great.

08:35.200 --> 08:36.240
This is hilarious.

08:36.240 --> 08:37.120
Nani wrote this?

08:37.120 --> 08:42.880
You know, Teresa and I debated this a little bit, but I think that any kind of greeting

08:42.880 --> 08:46.320
card, anything like that is such a fucking waste.

08:46.320 --> 08:49.680
Waste of money, waste of resources, waste of time.

08:49.680 --> 08:56.000
Like it's- especially when you're giving another present and a card, it seems so redundant.

08:56.000 --> 08:59.840
And so like they know it's from you because your name's on the tag.

08:59.840 --> 09:02.480
They know it's their birthday and you're wishing them a happy birthday because you're

09:02.480 --> 09:03.840
already giving them a present.

09:03.840 --> 09:06.240
Why do I also have to get someone a card?

09:06.240 --> 09:10.880
I really think that we are going to- I think a lot of people feel that way, Travis, and

09:10.880 --> 09:18.320
I feel like we're going to have one moment like in- like in Pleasantville where one person

09:18.320 --> 09:20.480
realizes, hey, I hate this.

09:20.480 --> 09:22.400
I hate getting these and I hate buying these.

09:22.400 --> 09:25.040
And it's just going to explode virally.

09:25.040 --> 09:27.920
Like all of a sudden everyone will say, oh, thank God.

09:27.920 --> 09:28.720
Me too.

09:28.720 --> 09:29.760
I thought you liked it.

09:29.760 --> 09:31.040
The process is terrible.

09:31.040 --> 09:35.120
Like you go and you're looking at cards and you're trying to think like, okay, what in

09:35.120 --> 09:40.160
like two pages is going to sum up my relationship with this person, what I think about them

09:40.160 --> 09:41.600
and what I think about myself.

09:42.240 --> 09:47.440
It's such like a weirdly like introspective kind of thing of like, what does this card

09:47.440 --> 09:49.600
say about me when I give it to this person?

09:49.600 --> 09:56.880
But there are so many ways that cards can intensify the pleasure of a present.

09:56.880 --> 09:58.480
They're present lube.

09:58.480 --> 10:01.200
There is but one way and that is ironically.

10:01.920 --> 10:03.440
No, it doesn't have to be.

10:03.440 --> 10:06.880
You can't look at life through the veil of irony or else you're going to miss so many

10:06.880 --> 10:08.960
great things like fucking-

10:08.960 --> 10:09.760
Jimmy Buffett.

10:09.760 --> 10:10.640
Jimmy Buffett.

10:10.640 --> 10:11.520
You motherfucker.

10:11.520 --> 10:15.280
I've tried so hard to not tweet your shit on Spotify.

10:15.280 --> 10:17.360
It's all he listens to anymore.

10:17.360 --> 10:20.960
But you open up a card and you're like, oh, fuck it, another time for another card.

10:20.960 --> 10:25.680
It's just another, you know, short poem about what a special grandson I am.

10:25.680 --> 10:27.920
And then you open it up and what is it?

10:27.920 --> 10:30.160
Oh no, it's the far side.

10:30.160 --> 10:35.200
And then you get a great old Gary Larson nugget of comedy in there before you open your present.

10:35.200 --> 10:36.240
It's an aperitif.

10:36.240 --> 10:40.080
It's an amuse-bouche that cleanses the palette and then you open it up.

10:40.080 --> 10:40.800
What's in there?

10:40.800 --> 10:41.920
It's a bop it.

10:41.920 --> 10:45.280
The great kind of bop it with like five different commands on it.

10:45.280 --> 10:48.000
And it's better because of the far side.

10:48.000 --> 10:52.400
For my money, there has only ever been one good card.

10:53.040 --> 10:55.600
I've given it to probably a dozen people.

10:55.600 --> 10:57.520
I buy stacks of it whenever I can find it.

10:57.520 --> 10:59.200
And you can't find it anymore.

10:59.200 --> 11:01.840
But it's a picture of a dad and two daughters.

11:01.840 --> 11:05.040
And the dad and one of the daughters have signs that say happy birthday.

11:05.680 --> 11:09.200
And the second daughter has a sign that says, I like corn on the cob.

11:09.840 --> 11:12.720
And on the inside it says, please disregard Stephanie.

11:13.520 --> 11:14.960
See, that's good shit.

11:14.960 --> 11:15.760
It's the best card.

11:15.760 --> 11:16.800
It's the best card.

11:16.800 --> 11:17.520
That's primo.

11:17.520 --> 11:18.080
And you know what?

11:18.080 --> 11:19.680
That puts you in a mood, doesn't it?

11:19.680 --> 11:21.120
I get that card and I'm in a mood.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.960
And now I'm ready to receive and then I get the gift.

11:24.960 --> 11:25.920
Ah, fuck yeah.

11:26.720 --> 11:27.760
It's a gift fluffer.

11:28.320 --> 11:29.280
That's what I'm saying.

11:29.280 --> 11:34.480
I think that like you've got to hold on to cards because I think there are fewer,

11:35.280 --> 11:42.720
more pure and blissful forms of comedy on this planet than recycling cards

11:42.720 --> 11:48.000
that you got for someone like say an ex-girlfriend's parents for your birthday.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.120
And then you recycle that.

11:49.120 --> 11:51.840
And then all of a sudden you're wishing your brother a happy anniversary.

11:52.480 --> 11:54.240
That's amazing stuff.

11:54.880 --> 11:56.000
That's really, really good stuff.

11:56.000 --> 11:59.840
Yeah, our dad taught us that gag.

11:59.840 --> 12:04.800
And I think I still, it is always actually my instinct to buy the card

12:04.800 --> 12:10.320
that would be the least appropriate for the occasion as a sort of like a built-in punchline.

12:10.320 --> 12:10.880
Yeah.

12:10.880 --> 12:11.520
And it's like a-

12:11.520 --> 12:12.240
What?

12:12.240 --> 12:15.120
It's like a fun like mystery that you have to unravel.

12:15.120 --> 12:17.360
Like what was the original context of this card?

12:17.360 --> 12:23.360
Justin, you got an anniversary card from me by way of Doval, my ex-girlfriend's dad.

12:23.360 --> 12:28.480
And then you had to remember who that was and why I would ever know a person named Doval.

12:28.480 --> 12:30.880
And now you're in there like now you've cracked it.

12:30.880 --> 12:31.440
Good work.

12:32.080 --> 12:32.880
Thanks.

12:32.880 --> 12:34.000
I feel like I solved it.

12:34.720 --> 12:35.680
But do we keep them?

12:35.680 --> 12:36.160
That's the thing.

12:36.160 --> 12:37.520
Yes, for that express purpose.

12:38.080 --> 12:41.200
If they're a grand slam and you have a lot of good memories, you keep them.

12:41.200 --> 12:45.600
But I think if you're not attached to it in any way, it was clearly a formality from the person.

12:45.600 --> 12:48.640
Like you trash it.

12:48.640 --> 12:54.240
Yeah, I think that like a healthy buffer of like two weeks, because here's what you do.

12:54.240 --> 12:56.480
You get the card, you put it on your mantle.

12:56.480 --> 12:58.080
It sits there for like a week, two weeks.

12:58.080 --> 12:59.360
I don't even do that.

12:59.360 --> 13:00.800
That's crazy.

13:01.440 --> 13:04.320
I think you only have to do that if it was a card only occasion.

13:05.120 --> 13:09.520
If they give you a card and a gift, you can trash the card as soon as the party's over.

13:09.520 --> 13:10.400
Yeah.

13:10.400 --> 13:13.840
Because you have the gift to display to say like, I care about the thing you gave me.

13:13.840 --> 13:18.160
But like if all they gave you was like a card expressing like how proud of you they are and

13:18.160 --> 13:20.880
like a check, you can't display the check.

13:20.880 --> 13:25.840
I just I wish there was some sort of resale environment for greeting cards.

13:25.840 --> 13:29.600
I think there's a secondhand market that exists out there, especially now that I've established

13:29.600 --> 13:31.520
that it's the fucking funniest thing ever.

13:31.520 --> 13:33.920
Like traditional cards just don't cut it.

13:33.920 --> 13:34.480
They don't.

13:34.480 --> 13:36.960
I wish I could get a pre used card.

13:36.960 --> 13:38.000
That's what I'm saying.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.440
A lightly used or fuck it.

13:40.400 --> 13:46.080
I want a never ending tome of greeting cards.

13:46.080 --> 13:50.720
A card that is like has been reused 50 times over and it's been somebody's birthday card,

13:50.720 --> 13:52.880
somebody's Bob Mitzvah card and somebody's brisk card.

13:53.760 --> 13:54.720
So let me throw this out.

13:54.720 --> 13:55.520
Like, sorry.

13:56.160 --> 13:56.800
So how about this?

13:56.800 --> 13:59.600
No, you said it and it's in the episode forever now.

14:00.240 --> 14:01.680
They know what I want to lean into it.

14:01.680 --> 14:03.360
Let me throw this out.

14:03.360 --> 14:06.960
Let me that's your fucking that's your fucking DJ cool.

14:06.960 --> 14:08.160
Let me clear my throat.

14:08.960 --> 14:10.000
Go to the library.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.200
Check out a birthday card.

14:11.200 --> 14:11.920
You open the front.

14:11.920 --> 14:15.440
You see where all the dates are stamped right and the names are signed.

14:15.440 --> 14:19.920
You check out the birthday card for someone's birthday and make sure you say I am going to

14:19.920 --> 14:21.120
need that back.

14:21.120 --> 14:22.560
I've got to return it to you.

14:22.560 --> 14:25.760
It's it's forty five cents a day that it goes past.

14:25.760 --> 14:27.120
So I need you to get this back.

14:27.120 --> 14:28.000
But happy birthday.

14:28.000 --> 14:28.480
I mean it.

14:28.480 --> 14:29.040
I love you.

14:29.040 --> 14:30.800
You're my most special grandpa.

14:30.800 --> 14:34.080
But fucking if you don't get this back to the library, I'm coming for your ass.

14:34.080 --> 14:36.720
I think the I think the recipient has to return it.

14:36.720 --> 14:39.840
Oh, I think that's the only thing that can make it better for you.

14:40.800 --> 14:41.040
Yeah.

14:44.080 --> 14:45.040
I got you a chore.

14:45.680 --> 14:50.400
My friend started a comic book store in our small town a little over a year ago.

14:51.200 --> 14:53.040
He plans to go out of business soon.

14:53.040 --> 14:55.600
Nobody plans to go out of nobody plans to go out of business.

14:56.240 --> 14:58.400
He expects to go out of business soon.

14:58.400 --> 15:00.320
And let's see.

15:00.320 --> 15:03.920
February is looking pretty good for everything I own to come.

15:04.480 --> 15:05.040
Oh, no.

15:06.080 --> 15:08.480
What's the etiquette for the death of a friend's dream?

15:09.120 --> 15:10.480
Do I send him a card?

15:10.480 --> 15:10.800
Yes.

15:11.600 --> 15:14.880
If it makes any difference, he is not into hugs.

15:14.880 --> 15:16.080
And that's from morning.

15:16.080 --> 15:18.000
Miss Marvel in Logan.

15:19.120 --> 15:22.800
Seems like some sort of Wolverine tie in could have been appropriate there.

15:22.800 --> 15:25.440
But oh, yes, I'm no expert.

15:25.440 --> 15:27.120
And I'm sorry about Miss Marvel.

15:27.120 --> 15:30.080
Oh, I'm sorry about your friend's dream.

15:30.080 --> 15:34.240
But and I guys, I hate to be this way after receiving this bad news.

15:34.240 --> 15:36.960
But this is what happens when you don't get money zone spots.

15:37.680 --> 15:38.000
Right.

15:38.000 --> 15:38.960
We could have blown that.

15:38.960 --> 15:40.560
We could have fucking helped out.

15:41.200 --> 15:42.000
God, wait a minute.

15:42.000 --> 15:42.960
You should be careful.

15:42.960 --> 15:43.760
Maybe we did.

15:44.720 --> 15:46.320
I don't remember all of them.

15:46.320 --> 15:50.560
This this strikes me as like one of those moments in like a movie or a TV show where

15:50.560 --> 15:55.920
what happens is unlike the night before it gets turned over to the bank or whatever,

15:55.920 --> 16:00.080
you just go in with like a six pack of beers and you and your friends have montage

16:00.080 --> 16:08.240
remembrances of all the good times you had in the comic book store or fucking UHF fucking

16:08.240 --> 16:09.920
pledge drive last minute.

16:09.920 --> 16:11.360
Last you got to be careful.

16:11.360 --> 16:12.080
Oh, my God.

16:12.080 --> 16:16.080
You got to be so careful that you do a UHF and not a be kind rewind.

16:16.640 --> 16:17.600
Oh, boy.

16:17.600 --> 16:18.240
Howdy.

16:18.240 --> 16:20.000
That's that's very that's very key.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.040
Hey, be kind rewind.

16:21.040 --> 16:25.680
Thanks for being an adorable and funny movie that ends with like the crushing acceptance

16:25.680 --> 16:29.200
that bad things often happen and cannot be changed.

16:29.200 --> 16:30.240
Geez, spoilers.

16:30.800 --> 16:31.360
Yeah, really?

16:32.400 --> 16:33.680
Let's go back to UHF.

16:33.680 --> 16:38.640
See, they buy stocks in UHF, you see shares.

16:38.640 --> 16:40.800
And then at the end, they're not going to make it.

16:40.800 --> 16:47.360
And there's a homeless gentleman who had been given a nickel, a special nickel that

16:47.360 --> 16:48.640
he sold for a bunch of money.

16:48.640 --> 16:50.720
And he comes in and saves the day at the end.

16:50.720 --> 16:56.400
And thank you for giving a run down of you.

16:56.400 --> 16:57.840
That was really good.

16:57.840 --> 16:58.480
Thank you.

16:58.480 --> 17:03.760
Now this will only work if there's a big corporate comic book store in town that has

17:03.760 --> 17:05.200
been putting him out of business.

17:05.200 --> 17:06.080
Globo comic.

17:06.640 --> 17:07.280
We'll call them.

17:09.200 --> 17:10.560
I hate to hear this first off.

17:10.560 --> 17:12.160
Like this is this is very sad.

17:12.160 --> 17:20.960
What I would try to urge you to have your friend focus on is that while the comic book

17:20.960 --> 17:28.320
store may not have thrived, the dream was fulfilled.

17:28.320 --> 17:33.280
I mean, so many people walk around thinking, you know, I'd love to do this.

17:33.280 --> 17:35.520
I'd love to have a comic book store.

17:35.520 --> 17:39.360
I'd love to have, you know, a bar that I own.

17:39.360 --> 17:41.520
I'd love to have a hit comedy podcast.

17:41.520 --> 17:47.600
With my two brothers, people have these dreams and they just carry them around and never

17:47.600 --> 17:48.160
live them out.

17:48.160 --> 17:49.600
Your friend did it.

17:49.600 --> 17:53.600
I mean, they they started a comic book store that they they owned it.

17:53.600 --> 17:54.800
They worked there.

17:54.800 --> 17:55.520
It was their baby.

17:55.520 --> 18:00.720
I mean, they did it, you know, just because it ends doesn't mean that they didn't, you

18:00.720 --> 18:02.000
know, get to live their dream.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.640
And that's that's a lot further than a lot of people get.

18:04.640 --> 18:05.920
Let me ask you guys this.

18:05.920 --> 18:10.240
Does how does it change this situation and how this person should react to it?

18:10.240 --> 18:15.760
If it's because it's one of two things, either the comic book store is closing because, you

18:15.760 --> 18:20.640
know, the economy or maybe it's in a bad location or because everyone's going digital and no

18:20.640 --> 18:26.400
one's like buying comic books anymore or be who the friend running this store just ran

18:26.400 --> 18:27.680
it into the ground.

18:28.800 --> 18:29.280
It's free.

18:29.280 --> 18:29.680
Come.

18:29.680 --> 18:30.240
It's free.

18:30.240 --> 18:33.040
Comic Wednesday, by which I mean, everything's free.

18:33.040 --> 18:34.160
Come come and get it.

18:35.120 --> 18:35.680
You know what I mean?

18:35.680 --> 18:38.720
Like how Stan Lee to run the store on the weekends.

18:38.720 --> 18:40.320
How do you react if you know what I mean?

18:40.320 --> 18:43.840
Like because if it's the economy, I feel like that's so much easier because like then you

18:43.840 --> 18:49.280
have that like grumbling like, oh, man, it was the deck was stacked against you.

18:49.280 --> 18:52.400
Oh, oh, maybe maybe in 10 years.

18:52.400 --> 18:56.560
But right now, but then when you know your friend like, oh, you were doing that, like

18:56.560 --> 19:01.760
buy one, get six free deal to try to get people in the door and you you ruined it.

19:02.720 --> 19:04.400
Like, how do you comfort that friend?

19:05.040 --> 19:08.640
I know I think you have to blame the economy no matter what.

19:08.640 --> 19:10.800
Never admit this friend's family.

19:10.800 --> 19:14.400
The time for that conversation was roughly six months ago.

19:14.400 --> 19:19.600
The time for that conversation was when he decided to let the giant hungry goat sleep

19:19.600 --> 19:20.640
in his comic book store.

19:22.320 --> 19:26.880
That was before that happened was the ideal time to say, hey, maybe you should have a

19:26.880 --> 19:30.400
strict no goat policy for this establishment.

19:30.400 --> 19:31.280
Lot of edibles.

19:34.160 --> 19:35.120
I hate to hear this.

19:35.120 --> 19:36.240
I hate to hear it, too.

19:36.240 --> 19:42.240
You know, I mean, is it too late to save it by doing what my local comic book store did?

19:42.240 --> 19:42.960
Well, not did.

19:42.960 --> 19:47.120
It just started to have this in its DNA from the beginning and that they sell comics, but

19:47.120 --> 19:50.640
they also sell board games and fucking magic cards and D&D minis.

19:50.640 --> 19:52.880
And they rent out table space where people play D&D.

19:52.880 --> 19:55.840
I feel like a lot of comic book stores go in that direction where it's just like a honey

19:55.840 --> 19:57.520
pot for like seven kinds of nerds.

19:58.080 --> 19:59.760
It's like a full hobby shop.

19:59.760 --> 19:59.920
Right.

19:59.920 --> 20:02.800
And you get them in there like, I don't know, I just kind of want to play some Pokemon cards.

20:02.800 --> 20:03.680
They're like, cool, cool, cool.

20:03.680 --> 20:04.880
Have you read the new Hawkeye?

20:04.880 --> 20:05.680
What's a Hawkeye?

20:05.680 --> 20:06.640
What's reading?

20:06.640 --> 20:08.480
And they say, I've got a lot of things for you.

20:08.480 --> 20:09.680
And the guy who's a hawk.

20:09.680 --> 20:10.720
There's a guy who's a hawk.

20:10.720 --> 20:11.600
He's a pretty cool guy.

20:13.360 --> 20:13.760
No joke.

20:13.760 --> 20:16.240
That's actually why I started reading comics.

20:16.240 --> 20:19.360
Because you were just there playing Pokemon?

20:19.360 --> 20:20.000
I was there.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.600
Well, I wasn't playing Pokemon.

20:21.600 --> 20:24.480
I was filling in the gaps of my collection.

20:24.480 --> 20:25.680
For you, it's more art.

20:25.680 --> 20:26.480
It's more like you're painting.

20:26.480 --> 20:27.760
I appreciate the arts.

20:27.760 --> 20:28.880
The art of the dance.

20:28.880 --> 20:37.440
I appreciate seeing how the artist of the card has realized Electabuzz in his native environment.

20:38.080 --> 20:39.520
The Electabuzz card is beautiful.

20:39.520 --> 20:40.480
It's on acrylic.

20:40.480 --> 20:41.920
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

20:41.920 --> 20:42.960
Please, anything.

20:43.680 --> 20:48.640
This Yahoo is sent in by level 44,000 Yahoo shaman Drew Davenport.

20:48.640 --> 20:50.160
Thank you, Drew Davenport.

20:50.160 --> 20:56.000
It's by Yahoo Answers user Jim, who asks, how to package hummus for trick-or-treaters.

20:56.000 --> 20:59.200
Oh, no.

20:59.200 --> 21:03.920
I'm handing out homemade hummus this Halloween and want to ensure it stays fresh and doesn't

21:03.920 --> 21:06.560
spill in the bags of trick-or-treaters.

21:06.560 --> 21:09.360
What is the best small inexpensive container I can use?

21:09.360 --> 21:10.080
Garbage can.

21:11.280 --> 21:13.680
Just hand each of them pre-thrown away.

21:15.920 --> 21:17.440
I know what you're doing with this when you get home.

21:18.080 --> 21:23.600
The thing that I imagined was like, do you guys use those dishwasher packs of detergent?

21:23.600 --> 21:27.040
I imagine that, just like filled with hummus.

21:27.040 --> 21:30.880
But I want it to be like super pressurized, so like when you puncture it at all, it's

21:30.880 --> 21:34.720
just like an ocean of hummus, just sort of spraying out.

21:35.760 --> 21:38.640
So I'm a 30-year-old man.

21:38.640 --> 21:40.240
I have not trick-or-treated in many years.

21:41.440 --> 21:46.800
But I wonder if parents have become more or less like, we have to check your candy and

21:46.800 --> 21:49.200
go through your stuff before you can eat any of it.

21:49.200 --> 21:51.760
Or if now it's just like, fuck it, I don't care.

21:51.760 --> 21:59.840
In this, in the dawning of the age of Etsy, fucking everyone's gotta be crazy about homemade

21:59.840 --> 22:00.240
goods.

22:00.240 --> 22:02.160
You made cake, what'd you get?

22:02.160 --> 22:07.200
Well, I got two bit of honeys, I got one fun-sized Snickers, and like 8,000 cake pops.

22:08.400 --> 22:12.560
Yeah, and so like our parents are like, well, you can have those three things, and I guess

22:12.560 --> 22:14.160
I gotta garbage the rest of this.

22:14.160 --> 22:16.960
No, no, I think parents are down.

22:16.960 --> 22:20.480
I don't think nobody puts fucking razor blades and pineapples.

22:20.480 --> 22:29.200
That candy stuff is the most, it's such a bad and good side of humanity.

22:29.200 --> 22:34.480
It's like, there's one night where kids can just go door-to-door and their neighbors

22:34.480 --> 22:38.880
in the spirit of community open their doors and give the kids free candy.

22:38.880 --> 22:43.760
There has to be one person who's like, but what if one sicko wants to poison it and they

22:43.760 --> 22:45.680
wanna poison a bunch of kids?

22:45.680 --> 22:47.920
Like, listen, it's not hard to poison kids.

22:47.920 --> 22:52.880
If you're looking for an opportunity to do that, kids will eat anything, okay?

22:53.680 --> 22:55.440
You don't have to make a big show of it.

22:56.880 --> 23:02.160
I imagine if I was like, I'm so horny to poison kids, I would probably get a job as

23:02.160 --> 23:03.680
someone who works in a cafeteria.

23:04.240 --> 23:06.000
That would be the gig for that person.

23:06.000 --> 23:10.880
They wouldn't set a trap and hand poison everything.

23:10.880 --> 23:14.080
I think they'd just dump something into oatmeal and say, best of luck.

23:14.080 --> 23:16.800
You know, I'm really gonna make an evening out of killing these kids.

23:16.800 --> 23:17.280
Sure.

23:17.280 --> 23:19.440
Yeah, like, don't make a big production out of it.

23:20.160 --> 23:26.880
Somebody, Yahoo Answers user starfishltd said, Ziploc baggies, but as you've been told,

23:26.880 --> 23:28.560
homemade treats get thrown out.

23:28.560 --> 23:32.720
If you put your name and address on an accompanying card, they may keep it.

23:32.720 --> 23:35.280
Oh, this is, oh, this is Bryce Hummus?

23:36.080 --> 23:40.240
This is Bryce Hummus at 2101 Oakshire?

23:40.240 --> 23:42.400
Oh, man, you got it.

23:42.400 --> 23:43.760
Yeah, no, this one is-

23:43.760 --> 23:45.360
This is some artisanal hummus.

23:45.360 --> 23:48.720
This is artisanal, you're a fucking little kid, you wouldn't appreciate the work that

23:48.720 --> 23:49.920
went into these chickpeas.

23:49.920 --> 23:52.400
Wait, that's an even bigger question, girl.

23:52.400 --> 23:56.960
What little kid is like, I got a fun-sized snicker, I got some, oh, hummus!

23:56.960 --> 23:59.360
Oh, a gross bag of hummus!

24:00.080 --> 24:02.480
Mom, some loose hummus in my bag?

24:02.480 --> 24:02.640
Yes, please.

24:02.640 --> 24:04.160
Cut up those green peppers, Mom.

24:06.000 --> 24:07.280
We're having a night.

24:07.280 --> 24:09.920
Have some friends over, I've got Nosh covered.

24:10.640 --> 24:13.440
Do you remember when we used to play poker with our Halloween candy?

24:13.440 --> 24:20.080
Can you, what is, what is the fucking exchange rate of a fucking dime bag of hummus?

24:20.960 --> 24:24.960
The hummus works to lower the price, like, all I've got is this full-size snicker.

24:24.960 --> 24:28.160
Okay, wait, and hummus, so then it's like half of a candy bar.

24:28.160 --> 24:33.680
You can always tell when Teddy KGB goes for a second dip into the hummus that he's bluffing.

24:33.680 --> 24:35.200
Do not splash the hummus!

24:37.440 --> 24:38.000
He's my-

24:39.280 --> 24:41.440
Splash the hummus whenever I want.

24:41.440 --> 24:44.000
Ah, fuck me. He's a man, he's chickpeas.

24:45.280 --> 24:49.440
As an adult kid, just give him a fucking Milky Way.

24:50.080 --> 24:51.360
What's the matter with you?

24:52.240 --> 24:54.400
Like, it's what Halloween is for.

24:54.400 --> 24:57.680
Kids, like, it's almost like, I remember there was a person on our block that just would,

24:57.680 --> 25:04.000
like, reach into a bowl of change and just, like, dump, like, six pennies and a nickel into your bag.

25:04.000 --> 25:04.240
Oh, yeah.

25:04.240 --> 25:10.880
And it was, it was as though his hand was saying, and fuck you, and here's 11 cents.

25:10.880 --> 25:14.400
Like, okay, great, I'll just throw this away later.

25:14.400 --> 25:16.560
How? How sad?

25:17.600 --> 25:22.400
I'm sorry, it's like, all I can think about is that Halloween episode of Freaks and Geeks.

25:23.040 --> 25:26.320
How sad is that episode of Freaks and Geeks where the mom makes all the cookies,

25:26.320 --> 25:28.240
then, like, none of the parents will take the cookies,

25:28.240 --> 25:30.960
and then Linda Cardinale throws eggs at her brother?

25:30.960 --> 25:31.360
Fuck.

25:32.160 --> 25:36.240
Freaks and Geeks, you brought me down, and I haven't watched you in months.

25:36.240 --> 25:37.680
I've never even seen the show, and now I'm like-

25:37.680 --> 25:38.800
Well, we've balanced it out. Watch the Halloween Pete and Pete.

25:39.520 --> 25:39.840
Yeah.

25:39.840 --> 25:40.480
Yeah, that's cool.

25:40.480 --> 25:41.120
That's a good one.

25:41.120 --> 25:43.600
Did you just say you've never seen fucking Freaks and Geeks?

25:43.600 --> 25:44.560
Yeah, I'm sorry.

25:45.760 --> 25:49.200
This has been our Halloween recap episode of My Brother and My Brother and Me,

25:49.200 --> 25:51.360
where we go through some of the classic Halloween eps.

25:54.000 --> 25:54.720
I have a kid.

25:54.720 --> 25:55.680
I want to tell you guys this.

25:55.680 --> 25:57.280
This is not a question or anything.

25:57.280 --> 25:59.440
I'm just sort of, like, going off script.

25:59.440 --> 26:02.560
I have a kid now, and she wakes up early.

26:02.560 --> 26:02.960
I know.

26:02.960 --> 26:12.400
Now, did you guys know that at 7.15 a.m. every morning, Cartoon Network shows Check It Out with Steve Bruhl,

26:12.400 --> 26:20.080
but at seven o'clock every morning, every morning, they show a special called Fartcopter?

26:20.080 --> 26:22.000
Did you know that?

26:22.000 --> 26:25.360
Every- that's their fucking, like, color bars and beep?

26:25.360 --> 26:28.400
That's the color bars is- and I thought it was a series,

26:28.400 --> 26:33.440
because it's about a kid selling a helicopter toy that makes fart noises,

26:33.440 --> 26:36.560
and it's, like, the best toy and kids are so violent

26:36.560 --> 26:40.480
that it's the only thing that will distract them from violence is Fartcopter.

26:40.480 --> 26:41.680
And I watched it the first time.

26:41.680 --> 26:44.320
I was like, this is amazing that this is a series,

26:44.320 --> 26:49.360
but no, it's a 15-minute special called Fartcopter that they show every day.

26:50.240 --> 26:51.520
It's baffling to me.

26:51.520 --> 26:55.360
Is this- it sounds a lot to me like Thunderpants.

26:55.360 --> 26:58.160
It sounds a lot to me like Thunderpants.

26:58.160 --> 27:00.800
The movie- do you guys know about Thunderpants?

27:01.600 --> 27:06.400
I always saw it- I always saw it on the shelves in Blockbuster,

27:06.400 --> 27:13.360
and it's sort of like my- it's sort of like my- that book that Desmond from Lost,

27:13.360 --> 27:15.680
like, only wanted to read right before he died.

27:15.680 --> 27:21.440
Thunderpants is like my swan song, and it has Rupert Grint in it.

27:21.440 --> 27:22.880
I'm looking at the IMDB.

27:22.880 --> 27:23.440
Fuck me.

27:23.440 --> 27:25.360
It's got Ned Beatty.

27:25.360 --> 27:27.680
It's got Paul Giamatti.

27:27.680 --> 27:31.120
It's got Stephen Fry in it and Rupert Grint from the Harry Potter films.

27:31.120 --> 27:33.680
And here's the description.

27:33.680 --> 27:38.080
An 11-year-old boy's amazing ability to break wind leaps him first to fame

27:38.080 --> 27:42.800
and then to death row before it helps him fulfill his ambition of becoming an astronaut.

27:42.800 --> 27:44.800
What?

27:44.800 --> 27:46.160
Stephen Fry.

27:46.960 --> 27:48.400
Cool stuff, man.

27:49.200 --> 27:50.880
Hey, Ned Beatty, how's your whole thing?

27:50.880 --> 27:54.080
Is Ned Beatty related to Ned Beatty?

27:54.880 --> 28:01.840
No, Ned Beatty is like, he's a- he's a- IMDB, we have to talk about your descriptions.

28:01.840 --> 28:07.600
Ned Beatty, stocky, genial-looking, supporting actor who was born and raised in Louisville.

28:07.600 --> 28:08.320
Fuck off.

28:09.840 --> 28:10.880
He wrote that himself.

28:11.680 --> 28:12.400
Bad actor.

28:12.960 --> 28:14.400
Anyway, fart movies.

28:14.400 --> 28:15.440
What were we talking about?

28:16.080 --> 28:16.800
Fart movies.

28:17.440 --> 28:18.880
We weren't actually talking about anything.

28:18.880 --> 28:20.880
How about another question?

28:20.880 --> 28:24.560
I recently moved to a town that has a reputation for being kind of dangerous.

28:25.200 --> 28:28.560
More often times than not, I find myself on the other end of some aggressive

28:28.560 --> 28:30.080
stares from rough-looking individuals.

28:30.080 --> 28:34.720
I'm an Asian male and as such, direct eye contact isn't my area of expertise.

28:35.680 --> 28:39.040
Coming out on top of a staring contest, even less so.

28:39.920 --> 28:45.520
With that in mind, what are some things I can do to wig out people who try to stare me down?

28:45.520 --> 28:49.120
That's from Glaring Gladiator in Gilroy.

28:49.120 --> 28:51.520
It- what is- I have to know what Gilroy is.

28:51.520 --> 28:54.400
Apparently, it's like Badlands.

28:54.400 --> 28:54.880
Yeah.

28:54.880 --> 28:55.760
It's in California.

28:56.320 --> 28:56.560
Okay.

28:57.360 --> 29:02.480
I- I will say that if- I guess the confusing thing about this question to me is,

29:02.480 --> 29:09.680
if your area is known for being kind of dangerous, maybe wigging out people is not a good idea.

29:09.680 --> 29:13.600
I bet- look at this guy over here, I bet it would take one push,

29:13.600 --> 29:16.320
one solitary push to get this nut off his rocker.

29:16.320 --> 29:17.040
Let's try it.

29:18.720 --> 29:20.480
And watch what happens when I do this.

29:23.040 --> 29:23.680
Let's dance.

29:26.960 --> 29:28.640
You won't use that gun, pussy.

29:31.120 --> 29:32.080
Guaranteed.

29:32.800 --> 29:33.520
Let's dance.

29:34.560 --> 29:36.000
I mean, maybe you guys-

29:36.000 --> 29:37.760
Yeah, I mean, I might just have Bowie on the brain,

29:37.760 --> 29:39.840
but can you dress up like Jareth from The Labyrinth?

29:39.840 --> 29:45.360
And just walk around all day fucking swirling a crystal ball of wishes.

29:45.360 --> 29:49.280
There is nothing that would be more intimidating than someone-

29:49.280 --> 29:51.680
someone staring you in the eye and you're like,

29:51.680 --> 29:54.880
I could beat this guy, I could take this Jareth looking motherfucker,

29:54.880 --> 29:57.760
and then he starts contact juggling with the magic of Fushimi.

29:57.760 --> 29:59.440
And walking up the side of a wall.

29:59.440 --> 30:00.640
You're like, well, fuck me.

30:00.640 --> 30:02.400
Well, okay, well, okay, maybe not.

30:02.400 --> 30:03.520
Now I'm wigged out.

30:03.520 --> 30:04.720
Now I'm wigged out.

30:04.720 --> 30:05.920
Now I've been wigged.

30:05.920 --> 30:10.160
No, I gotta go home and rethink some things.

30:10.160 --> 30:11.120
I gotta think some things.

30:11.120 --> 30:13.200
I thought I was the weirdest guy on this block.

30:13.200 --> 30:15.680
Look at this guy crawling up holding a baby.

30:16.880 --> 30:19.440
He just put me in a- he put me in an oubliette.

30:19.440 --> 30:20.560
No, I'm in an oubliette.

30:20.560 --> 30:21.680
I've never been in an oubliette.

30:21.680 --> 30:23.200
There's a whole new thing for me.

30:23.200 --> 30:25.680
I thought I was cool dressing like 1970s Bowie.

30:26.400 --> 30:28.080
I have to move out of this fucking town.

30:28.080 --> 30:29.200
It's too dangerous here.

30:29.200 --> 30:30.080
I'm in an oubliette.

30:32.640 --> 30:35.040
There was this song that he started singing,

30:35.040 --> 30:37.120
and I sang it with him about a babe

30:37.120 --> 30:38.240
and how I reminded him of it,

30:38.240 --> 30:39.760
and the song didn't stop.

30:40.320 --> 30:41.760
We couldn't stop singing it

30:41.760 --> 30:43.360
because it didn't have an end.

30:43.360 --> 30:44.320
It was horrifying.

30:44.320 --> 30:46.080
I walked 15 blocks to the train station

30:46.080 --> 30:47.040
and he put me in an oubliette,

30:47.040 --> 30:48.720
and then all of a sudden I'm back at my house.

30:48.720 --> 30:50.240
I have to start all over again.

30:51.280 --> 30:51.760
Sucks.

30:51.760 --> 30:52.640
This sucks.

30:52.640 --> 30:53.840
Jared, through the words.

30:53.840 --> 30:55.680
Got me walking in circles, buddy.

30:55.680 --> 30:56.720
I'm wigged out now.

30:56.720 --> 30:57.840
I'm officially wigged.

30:57.840 --> 30:58.720
I'm real wigged.

31:00.000 --> 31:00.800
Oh, man.

31:00.800 --> 31:01.680
Where's my baby?

31:01.680 --> 31:04.960
I'm gonna swear I had a baby.

31:04.960 --> 31:06.960
I had a baby like a minute ago.

31:06.960 --> 31:08.560
Can you listen to this?

31:08.560 --> 31:08.960
I got it.

31:08.960 --> 31:09.840
I solved the problem.

31:09.840 --> 31:10.640
Good news, guys.

31:10.640 --> 31:12.000
I solved the problem.

31:12.000 --> 31:13.440
When you get close to the person

31:13.440 --> 31:14.480
and you're staring them down,

31:14.480 --> 31:15.440
hand them a chick track.

31:16.320 --> 31:18.560
Say, hi, I want to take you through the Romans road.

31:20.800 --> 31:22.560
Do you know what happens to you when you die?

31:22.560 --> 31:23.280
Wait, come back.

31:23.280 --> 31:23.600
Come back.

31:23.600 --> 31:24.800
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

31:24.800 --> 31:25.840
You might not realize this,

31:25.840 --> 31:28.640
but something you're probably doing is witchcraft.

31:28.640 --> 31:30.560
You know that Ouija board you're carrying with you?

31:30.560 --> 31:32.960
Did you know that the devil lives inside of it?

31:32.960 --> 31:33.520
Oh, you don't have a-

31:33.520 --> 31:34.640
Can I just have a moment of your time?

31:34.640 --> 31:35.440
You don't have a Ouija?

31:36.240 --> 31:37.120
Do you play D&D?

31:37.120 --> 31:37.760
No, shit.

31:39.360 --> 31:40.640
Do you listen to Iggy Azalea?

31:40.640 --> 31:41.360
Do you like Kesha?

31:42.240 --> 31:42.740
Okay.

31:43.600 --> 31:44.160
We found it.

31:44.960 --> 31:46.000
There's our inn.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
Or the devil's inn, I guess I should say.

31:48.000 --> 31:50.640
That dollar sign in her name stands for Satan.

31:52.000 --> 31:53.360
Speaking of dollar signs.

31:53.360 --> 32:08.720
I got two words for you guys.

32:08.720 --> 32:09.440
Hungry boy.

32:10.080 --> 32:10.320
Okay.

32:11.440 --> 32:13.360
Have you checked out hungryboy.com?

32:13.360 --> 32:15.200
It's exactly what it sounds like.

32:15.200 --> 32:16.160
Hungry boy.

32:16.960 --> 32:17.360
Good news.

32:17.360 --> 32:18.880
Are you a hungry boy?

32:18.880 --> 32:22.080
Uh-oh, are we getting an on-air demonstration of how to eat?

32:22.080 --> 32:24.320
I got a solution for this hungry boy.

32:24.320 --> 32:25.120
Whoa, slow down.

32:25.120 --> 32:26.080
Step-by-step this.

32:26.640 --> 32:28.560
That's nurturebox.com.

32:28.560 --> 32:29.280
Nurturebox?

32:29.280 --> 32:30.400
That is what you're saying.

32:30.400 --> 32:32.160
No, they hate nurturebox.

32:32.160 --> 32:32.400
Yeah.

32:32.400 --> 32:33.600
Two of them are always at odds.

32:35.600 --> 32:38.560
Nurturebox is just pictures of moms hugging kids.

32:39.440 --> 32:40.320
You don't want that one.

32:40.320 --> 32:41.360
You want naturebox.

32:41.360 --> 32:48.880
They got delicious, wholesome snacks at naturebox.com delivered to you.

32:48.880 --> 32:51.280
Do you know what's better than delicious and wholesome?

32:51.280 --> 32:52.080
What?

32:52.080 --> 32:52.480
Free.

32:53.600 --> 32:55.360
Whoa, what?

32:55.360 --> 32:56.800
I'm picking up what you're laying down.

32:56.800 --> 32:58.400
How am I gonna get some free snacks?

32:58.400 --> 33:02.400
I want some free baked sweet potato fries or dark cocoa almonds.

33:02.400 --> 33:05.360
Would you like some free Dutch chocolate sun crunch?

33:05.360 --> 33:07.440
That's not, there's no way that's healthy.

33:08.000 --> 33:08.800
It is.

33:08.800 --> 33:12.720
Oh, and right now in October, and I don't know how long they'll have this,

33:12.720 --> 33:17.840
but pumpkin nom-noms, pumpkin spice nom-noms, they're incredible.

33:17.840 --> 33:18.960
They're incredible.

33:18.960 --> 33:21.360
We say this shit every week.

33:21.360 --> 33:25.600
I don't understand the fucking physical, chemical,

33:26.720 --> 33:29.440
natural makeup of what a fucking nom-nom is.

33:29.440 --> 33:32.720
We say this, we say those words every week and I don't, is it-

33:32.720 --> 33:36.000
I'm eating them and I still don't understand their dark sorcery.

33:36.640 --> 33:38.560
So you know how you have like a nom, right?

33:38.560 --> 33:38.800
No.

33:40.160 --> 33:43.600
Yeah, you know how a nom, like you get a nom off of a nom bush, right?

33:43.600 --> 33:45.600
And then you just kind of jam two of them together

33:45.600 --> 33:47.760
and you put some pumpkin spice in the middle.

33:47.760 --> 33:49.120
Okay. Yeah.

33:50.160 --> 33:51.360
It's so good.

33:52.160 --> 33:52.800
It's delicious.

33:53.520 --> 33:54.480
These snacks are free.

33:54.480 --> 33:58.800
If you go to naturebox.com slash my brother, you can get a free trial.

33:58.800 --> 34:01.520
They'll send you a trial box of five of the most popular snacks.

34:01.520 --> 34:04.560
If you work for nature box and you're listening to this,

34:04.560 --> 34:06.960
maybe send me some of those pumpkin nom-noms

34:06.960 --> 34:09.040
and some other stuff with no added sugar.

34:09.040 --> 34:10.560
I'm trying to get tiny.

34:10.560 --> 34:11.200
Help me out.

34:11.200 --> 34:17.680
Naturebox.com slash my brother is where you can get your free trial of delicious snacks.

34:17.680 --> 34:19.440
So if you do not do it, you're a fool.

34:19.440 --> 34:20.320
You're a fool.

34:20.320 --> 34:25.040
We have people every week who are like, I finally did it on Twitter.

34:25.040 --> 34:25.520
We see them.

34:26.720 --> 34:28.320
Do you want a fucking ribbon?

34:28.320 --> 34:30.640
You got free delicious food.

34:30.640 --> 34:31.680
Great, great job.

34:31.680 --> 34:32.480
Congratulations.

34:32.480 --> 34:35.920
Now that it's free, if 100% of our listeners aren't doing it,

34:35.920 --> 34:37.360
I don't know what's going on.

34:37.360 --> 34:40.960
Like we're giving you a gift of a free box of stangs.

34:40.960 --> 34:42.640
Just take our gift.

34:42.640 --> 34:43.920
Take our damn gift.

34:43.920 --> 34:45.200
I'm embarrassing us.

34:45.200 --> 34:48.320
You take fucking so much from us already.

34:48.320 --> 34:53.520
Don't pick and choose the lifeblood that you drain out of us.

34:53.520 --> 34:54.320
We're giving you food.

34:55.440 --> 34:57.120
Your three-headed giving tree.

34:58.080 --> 35:01.120
And now that we're just a stump, you're going to sit on us.

35:01.120 --> 35:02.320
We also have three butts.

35:03.360 --> 35:04.880
That's not important to this story.

35:04.880 --> 35:06.560
Why would you need to make that?

35:06.560 --> 35:08.000
Why would you need to specify that?

35:08.000 --> 35:09.920
I'm just trying to clarify the mental picture.

35:09.920 --> 35:14.320
The original giving tree didn't have one butt, Travis.

35:14.320 --> 35:15.120
Wait, wait, wait.

35:15.120 --> 35:16.320
How do you know that, Griffin?

35:17.280 --> 35:18.960
Because I asked the author.

35:18.960 --> 35:21.680
Take a second to think about the fact that the giving tree had a butt.

35:21.680 --> 35:25.520
I have read every piece of giving tree slash fiction that exists.

35:25.520 --> 35:27.120
That probably exists, doesn't it?

35:28.560 --> 35:30.160
The giving and taking tree.

35:30.880 --> 35:31.760
Hachi machi.

35:32.480 --> 35:32.980
Hulu.

35:34.240 --> 35:34.740
Yep.

35:34.740 --> 35:39.860
Okay, Travis, you did some weird...

35:42.500 --> 35:44.500
Some weird copy-paste here, my friend.

35:44.500 --> 35:48.020
Oh man, I am reading some giving tree slash fiction.

35:48.900 --> 35:52.260
It is all stump knots and bumps and dents.

35:53.380 --> 35:58.500
It is all sap and ruination.

35:58.500 --> 36:01.940
No, no, no, no.

36:01.940 --> 36:04.820
No, turn it off.

36:04.820 --> 36:06.100
Oh, God.

36:10.900 --> 36:11.400
No.

36:14.500 --> 36:16.740
A slice, it's just a sample.

36:16.740 --> 36:20.660
Isn't it better just to know how it's affecting me?

36:22.820 --> 36:24.020
Let Griffin take this hit.

36:24.980 --> 36:27.060
No need to ruin it for all of us.

36:27.060 --> 36:31.140
No, this is illegal.

36:31.140 --> 36:35.780
Griffin is absorbing all of this like John Coffee from the Green Mile.

36:36.340 --> 36:37.620
Leave the lights on.

36:42.820 --> 36:43.620
Fuck me.

36:46.180 --> 36:47.300
So you've tried Hulu.

36:49.060 --> 36:50.980
Oh my God, and it ends with...

36:50.980 --> 36:53.620
Okay, it's extremely explicit.

36:53.620 --> 36:58.100
And it ends, but it ends the way I think the book should end.

36:58.100 --> 37:00.500
This is the last sentence, and this is actually kind of beautiful.

37:00.500 --> 37:03.460
The shit before it, decidedly not beautiful.

37:04.100 --> 37:08.420
The boy laid down and wrapped himself around his childhood friend and love of his life.

37:08.420 --> 37:12.740
Aw, with one final sigh of contentment, gross, and a smile on his face,

37:12.740 --> 37:16.020
the boy closed his tired old eyes for the last time.

37:17.220 --> 37:19.860
He dies on the tree that he just fucked.

37:19.860 --> 37:21.220
With a huge boner.

37:21.220 --> 37:24.260
And was fucked by, thank you giving tree slash fiction.

37:24.260 --> 37:26.660
Did he fuck the tree to death?

37:26.660 --> 37:28.580
Did he, that was his last?

37:28.580 --> 37:30.180
He fucked it in half.

37:30.180 --> 37:34.580
Did he, is this his last action?

37:35.620 --> 37:37.700
Author's note, author's note.

37:37.700 --> 37:42.020
To enhance your reading experience of my tale of love and reconciliation,

37:42.020 --> 37:45.460
I suggest that you listen to Jeff Buckley's Hallelujah ball reading.

37:46.660 --> 37:50.500
I heard there was a secret tree that you could fuck.

37:52.340 --> 37:54.660
And all your childhood memories are dead.

37:54.660 --> 38:00.340
Cause I listened to a podcast, tried to sell me snacks.

38:00.340 --> 38:02.340
Oh no!

38:02.340 --> 38:06.420
Well, that was a fun sponsorship partnership that we had for a while.

38:06.420 --> 38:08.180
Goodbye, nature box.

38:08.180 --> 38:10.660
So Hulu, you all know Hulu, right?

38:11.540 --> 38:17.300
It's where you can see images that will wash away the images that you currently have in your head.

38:17.300 --> 38:23.460
But HuluPlus.com will do an even better job of laundering your mind with a bunch of,

38:23.460 --> 38:28.100
they got a bunch of current season episodes of shows like Modern Family and The Daily Show.

38:28.900 --> 38:33.700
And you can watch every episode of South Park only on Hulu Plus.

38:34.340 --> 38:35.060
That's amazing.

38:36.660 --> 38:42.260
I mean, Teresa and I use it for like Bob's Burgers and when new episodes of stuff come out.

38:42.260 --> 38:46.900
And we watch it all the time, especially since we moved and we're still getting everything set up.

38:46.900 --> 38:48.100
So it's really pretty awesome.

38:48.100 --> 38:49.380
I love Hulu Plus.

38:49.380 --> 38:49.780
Me too.

38:49.780 --> 38:51.300
I love it and they mean a lot to me.

38:51.300 --> 38:54.580
It's the only way that I watch ANTM Cycle 21.

38:54.580 --> 38:56.500
Boys still in that house.

38:56.500 --> 38:58.180
Still a lot of boys in that house though.

38:58.180 --> 38:59.540
Boys have not been removed from the house.

38:59.540 --> 39:00.660
Boys have not been removed.

39:00.660 --> 39:03.220
That man still wears a fucking beard weave.

39:03.220 --> 39:06.820
And then this week they did DNA tests and found out like,

39:06.820 --> 39:14.740
oh, you are one 100th of a 15,000th of a percent Eastern European.

39:14.740 --> 39:16.820
So that's what I'm going to make you dress up as.

39:16.820 --> 39:22.420
Yes, they had people dress up and you're one bajillionth Native American.

39:22.420 --> 39:27.540
Now put on this headdress and inexplicably pose with a gay bald robot.

39:29.540 --> 39:30.660
I'm not making this up.

39:30.660 --> 39:32.980
And Tyro is like, yeah, it's no big deal.

39:32.980 --> 39:36.180
In the future, all of our races will merge to become one.

39:36.180 --> 39:36.900
Okay.

39:36.900 --> 39:37.540
Okay.

39:37.540 --> 39:40.580
And also we will all be part artificial intelligence.

39:42.420 --> 39:42.660
What?

39:42.660 --> 39:51.060
Is there a producer of this show that steps back after every episode airs and goes,

39:51.060 --> 39:52.100
was that not enough?

39:52.100 --> 39:52.740
Was it not enough?

39:52.740 --> 39:54.980
What does it take to get this show canceled?

39:57.300 --> 40:00.740
This week they had, this is all on Hulu Plus, by the way.

40:00.740 --> 40:01.780
So you should be watching Hulu Plus.

40:01.780 --> 40:02.740
It's a fever dream.

40:02.740 --> 40:06.660
Hulu Plus injects you with a fever dream for 48 minutes a week.

40:06.660 --> 40:07.460
It's eight bucks a month.

40:07.460 --> 40:12.900
Right now you can get a two week free trial when you go to huluplus.com slash my brother.

40:12.900 --> 40:14.500
You get an extra week for free.

40:14.500 --> 40:15.700
So go do that.

40:15.700 --> 40:18.100
And they have tons of original content too.

40:18.100 --> 40:18.420
Oh yeah.

40:18.420 --> 40:18.740
Yeah.

40:18.740 --> 40:20.260
There's the awesomes.

40:20.260 --> 40:23.620
Seth Meyers and Mike Shoemaker made a show called The Awesomes about

40:24.180 --> 40:25.220
misfit superheroes.

40:25.220 --> 40:27.620
They got 10 episodes in season one and season two.

40:29.300 --> 40:31.140
Well, it says here it's premiering August 4th.

40:31.140 --> 40:34.260
So let's say that it's probably already up and cooking.

40:34.260 --> 40:38.900
And they have shows like East Loves High and The Real Housewives.

40:38.900 --> 40:42.180
Sorry, The Hot Wives of Orlando, which is a parody of The Real Housewives series.

40:42.180 --> 40:42.820
Tons of stuff.

40:42.820 --> 40:43.460
Go check it out.

40:43.460 --> 40:44.340
Okay, back to Griffin.

40:44.340 --> 40:45.380
So, okay.

40:45.380 --> 40:49.860
So they had, this week they had two gentlemen.

40:50.420 --> 40:56.420
One of them had been sort of making some homophobic comments and the other gentleman

40:56.420 --> 40:59.380
was a gay man who had been offended by said comments.

40:59.380 --> 41:00.900
So they've been sort of beefing.

41:00.900 --> 41:08.260
And then Tyra reveals to them in like, it's supposed to be a gigantic twist that they're

41:08.260 --> 41:09.940
both kind of Finnish.

41:11.780 --> 41:14.500
There's so much more that connects us than divides us.

41:14.500 --> 41:19.380
For instance, you're both, you're two hundredths of a trillionth of a percent Finnish and you

41:19.380 --> 41:21.940
are four hundred trillionths Swedish.

41:21.940 --> 41:23.060
And those are close together.

41:23.060 --> 41:24.980
And they were like, hug it out.

41:24.980 --> 41:26.340
Hug it out, my brother.

41:26.980 --> 41:30.420
There were like three people of different races and ethnic backgrounds.

41:30.420 --> 41:33.140
They're like, guys, you're all barely Asian.

41:33.140 --> 41:35.380
And one dude was like, I knew it.

41:35.380 --> 41:35.620
Yeah.

41:36.340 --> 41:43.300
And also it gave a lot of them instant permission to start using like really racist accents.

41:44.020 --> 41:49.460
Like this guy's like, you know, I always thought that I was just Italian and Native American

41:49.460 --> 41:52.340
and now I'm the Latin Lavera.

41:52.340 --> 41:55.700
Yeah, like he actually said, I'm Zoto.

41:55.700 --> 41:57.780
Like dog, dial it back.

41:57.780 --> 42:00.340
This is cycle 22.

42:00.340 --> 42:01.940
We're calling it dial it back.

42:01.940 --> 42:06.900
I think we might just have you guys smile while we take pictures of you for a while.

42:06.900 --> 42:09.380
Could you all just model for one episode?

42:09.380 --> 42:15.060
Can you just smile and let me take a fucking picture of you without spitting into a cup

42:15.060 --> 42:16.980
and having scientists analyze it?

42:17.700 --> 42:18.900
What are we doing?

42:20.020 --> 42:25.140
Boys are in the house and so is just like unadulterated lunacy.

42:25.140 --> 42:28.660
Fuck cycle 21.

42:30.420 --> 42:38.420
I have a message for Alexandra Splendor and it's from Maria Babin or Bebbin who asks who

42:38.420 --> 42:40.340
says to Alexandria Splendor.

42:40.980 --> 42:43.220
Oh man, it says it says read as Amelie.

42:43.220 --> 42:44.900
So I have to pump the brakes and let Justin.

42:44.900 --> 42:45.780
No, no, no, no.

42:45.780 --> 42:46.820
Let Griffin read it.

42:47.540 --> 42:48.340
No, I just can't.

42:48.340 --> 42:49.140
I don't do voices.

42:49.140 --> 42:49.860
That's not my thing.

42:50.980 --> 42:53.140
Happy 21st birthday, AJ.

42:53.140 --> 42:59.940
You are the friend I always had but never spoke to until the time the universe decided

42:59.940 --> 43:01.380
to send us to Italy.

43:02.420 --> 43:07.460
You deserve all the happiness that exists in this crazy world.

43:07.460 --> 43:09.220
Sir, you're the best.

43:09.220 --> 43:16.420
I don't know what I do with dance parties, endless laughs, and drunken times in Rome.

43:16.420 --> 43:18.260
I love you, glass shot.

43:20.820 --> 43:22.260
Why do people want that?

43:22.260 --> 43:24.900
God, that makes me so fucking horny.

43:24.900 --> 43:27.460
Oh no, it can't.

43:27.460 --> 43:28.180
It does.

43:28.180 --> 43:28.500
It can't.

43:28.500 --> 43:32.020
Got a message here for Travis McElroy.

43:32.020 --> 43:33.140
Hold on, start this over.

43:34.660 --> 43:39.060
It's a message for Travis McElroy and it's from Spencer.

43:39.060 --> 43:39.860
Oh man.

43:39.860 --> 43:42.820
And the message is hi Travis from Spencer.

43:43.540 --> 43:44.580
Hi Spencer.

43:44.580 --> 43:47.300
The preferred time frame for this to air is whenevs.

43:47.300 --> 43:49.540
That was like a hundred dollars.

43:49.540 --> 43:53.060
Money well spent, Spencer.

43:53.060 --> 43:55.220
That's so well spent.

43:55.220 --> 43:56.020
Can I say?

43:56.020 --> 43:56.820
Can I say?

43:56.820 --> 43:57.620
Yeah, yeah.

43:57.620 --> 43:59.860
It was the best greeting card I've ever received.

43:59.860 --> 44:00.740
Yeah, see?

44:00.740 --> 44:01.700
But we can't reuse it.

44:01.700 --> 44:02.820
It's the unfortunate part.

44:02.820 --> 44:03.300
There's no-

44:03.300 --> 44:04.420
I can too.

44:04.420 --> 44:07.220
There's no resale market for Jumbotrons.

44:08.820 --> 44:10.180
Trav, one more message.

44:10.180 --> 44:11.060
One more message.

44:12.180 --> 44:18.340
Got a message for the brilliant and delightful Lindsay Prevett from her friend and former

44:18.340 --> 44:19.780
traveling companion, Liz.

44:20.340 --> 44:24.900
Thank you so much for being great company and comforting me on so many long and arduous

44:24.900 --> 44:25.380
book tours.

44:25.380 --> 44:30.580
I will miss it all, but especially the bliss of hanging out in airport bars with you,

44:30.580 --> 44:33.780
watching soccer and listening to my bim bam together.

44:33.780 --> 44:37.460
You are and always will be the greatest.

44:37.460 --> 44:38.500
Oh my gosh.

44:38.500 --> 44:39.140
I love how-

44:39.140 --> 44:40.020
Beautiful and shit.

44:40.980 --> 44:42.980
Whoever wrote that should be a writer.

44:42.980 --> 44:48.580
Should be a writer of novels and autobiographies.

44:48.580 --> 44:50.020
That's our friend Liz Gilbert.

44:50.020 --> 44:50.500
Hi Liz.

44:51.060 --> 44:51.940
And that was her message.

44:52.820 --> 44:54.980
Mark your calendars for a brand new thing.

44:54.980 --> 45:00.420
The first ever Max Fun Week is coming up October 15th through 21st.

45:00.980 --> 45:05.300
Max Fun Week's all about celebrating the creativity and passion of our listeners.

45:05.300 --> 45:09.940
We'll have podcast crossovers, Q&As, behind the scenes tours, giveaways, and more.

45:09.940 --> 45:12.900
No fundraising, just awesome stuff for you.

45:12.900 --> 45:16.820
So tune into your favorite Max Fun shows, tell a friend about Max Fun, and check out

45:16.820 --> 45:20.820
some new shows during Max Fun Week, October 15th through 21st.

45:22.820 --> 45:27.380
I made the mistake of reading this Farm Wisdom ahead of time and it just bumps me out.

45:27.380 --> 45:29.300
Yeah.

45:29.300 --> 45:31.300
It's like, wait, Griffin, sorry, what did you say?

45:31.300 --> 45:40.100
Did you say, Farm Wisdom, Farm Wisdom, get your Pitchfork album recommendations, Farm

45:40.100 --> 45:43.380
Wisdom.

45:43.380 --> 45:44.180
Oh, God.

45:44.180 --> 45:46.020
It's like, guys, you can send us Farm Wisdom.

45:46.020 --> 45:49.060
It's like, baby chicks are really soft.

45:49.060 --> 45:51.620
They're scientifically proven to be the softest thing on Earth.

45:51.620 --> 45:52.260
That's great.

45:52.260 --> 45:52.740
Give me that.

45:52.740 --> 45:55.300
Baby chicks love so hard that it hurts them.

45:55.300 --> 45:55.860
No.

45:55.860 --> 45:56.260
Yes.

45:56.260 --> 45:57.060
Give me that.

45:57.060 --> 46:02.900
But don't give me, chickens only have one hole called a vent they use to poop, pee,

46:02.900 --> 46:06.100
lay eggs, and have sex simultaneously.

46:06.100 --> 46:08.420
That's from Jason Zeta from Montana.

46:08.420 --> 46:09.140
Simultaneously.

46:09.140 --> 46:09.460
Yes.

46:09.460 --> 46:12.100
They just sort of fucking explode down there.

46:13.300 --> 46:14.340
It's a bad mess.

46:14.900 --> 46:17.220
You have to schedule their whole day around it.

46:17.220 --> 46:17.780
There's a lot of-

46:17.780 --> 46:20.260
Can you go to my ballet recital that?

46:20.260 --> 46:20.980
What time is it?

46:20.980 --> 46:21.540
Three?

46:21.540 --> 46:22.340
Hell no.

46:22.900 --> 46:24.420
Well, no, I can't.

46:24.420 --> 46:26.260
I am booked every day at three.

46:26.260 --> 46:28.180
I can be there at 3.01.

46:29.940 --> 46:31.380
That's for goddamn sure.

46:32.180 --> 46:36.100
There's a lot of farmhouse sounds that I, Griffin McElroy, am acquainted to.

46:36.100 --> 46:39.460
Maybe a moo, or a baa, or a er-er-er-er.

46:39.460 --> 46:41.220
Not like a baa-baa.

46:41.220 --> 46:43.380
And that's the sound that chickens make.

46:43.380 --> 46:44.340
Not again, not again.

46:47.220 --> 46:48.020
Oh my god.

46:48.580 --> 46:49.380
Oh my god.

46:49.380 --> 46:50.020
I mean, it's over with.

46:50.020 --> 46:50.660
I wish I was dead.

46:51.300 --> 46:52.820
I mean, it's over with and done.

46:53.380 --> 46:54.660
They are dead for a second.

46:54.660 --> 47:00.420
I'm done for like a whole day, but oh my god, it never gets any easier.

47:01.700 --> 47:02.420
I need a minute.

47:03.780 --> 47:04.660
I don't have a minute.

47:04.660 --> 47:06.740
I gotta get to my daughter's ballet recital.

47:06.740 --> 47:08.660
There's a lot of stuff coming and going just in.

47:08.660 --> 47:09.220
Wowsers.

47:12.500 --> 47:15.540
If you're ever on Survivor, you can use chicken mess to start a fire.

47:15.540 --> 47:16.020
Is that true?

47:16.580 --> 47:17.060
Yeah.

47:17.060 --> 47:19.300
But what's, it's all so messy.

47:19.300 --> 47:22.020
What do we call, what are we classifying as the mess?

47:22.020 --> 47:22.740
That's everything.

47:22.740 --> 47:24.260
The poop, pee, eggs, whatever.

47:24.260 --> 47:24.740
The sex.

47:25.380 --> 47:26.020
The cx.

47:27.300 --> 47:28.020
Is there another one here?

47:28.020 --> 47:28.580
Yeah, there's another one.

47:28.580 --> 47:29.380
Is there another Farm Wisdom?

47:29.380 --> 47:30.500
Fact, fact.

47:30.500 --> 47:30.980
Hit me.

47:30.980 --> 47:34.820
Can you believe there are people who don't like the Farm Wisdom segment?

47:34.820 --> 47:35.860
People are fools.

47:35.860 --> 47:38.260
It enriches me cosmically.

47:39.140 --> 47:43.220
Fact, in cold climates, cows love hanging out on top of manure piles

47:43.220 --> 47:46.580
because the fermentation going on inside puts off a lot of heat.

47:46.580 --> 47:47.620
And that's from Jonathan.

47:48.740 --> 47:52.820
Jonathan, who I hope is not intimately familiar with poop heat.

47:53.860 --> 47:57.460
With the radiation of this situation.

47:57.460 --> 48:01.140
I bet at least one of those cows is just a dirty bird.

48:01.140 --> 48:01.620
They're all dirty birds.

48:01.620 --> 48:02.820
Yeah, it's warm here, right?

48:02.820 --> 48:03.620
I know, it's so gross.

48:03.620 --> 48:04.820
I would hate to do this before.

48:07.940 --> 48:10.740
There's a lot of different kinds of heat right now.

48:11.540 --> 48:15.380
Actually, I'm exhausted from making my chicken vent noise.

48:16.660 --> 48:17.460
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

48:18.020 --> 48:19.620
Absolutely.

48:19.620 --> 48:22.740
This Yahoo was sent in by Jesse Marciano.

48:22.740 --> 48:23.940
Thank you, Jesse.

48:23.940 --> 48:26.100
Marciano, I'm sorry I'm so bad at names, everybody.

48:26.100 --> 48:29.060
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Moon Yara, who asks,

48:30.020 --> 48:32.500
do you believe in the power of runes?

48:32.500 --> 48:33.140
No.

48:33.140 --> 48:34.340
Do you believe in runes?

48:34.340 --> 48:37.620
And what will happen to you if you carry a rune or runes in your pocket?

48:37.620 --> 48:39.140
Does it have an effect on your life?

48:39.140 --> 48:41.220
I wonder if I will benefit from it.

48:41.220 --> 48:42.580
Thank you for sharing your knowledge.

48:42.580 --> 48:47.540
What a great, like, mouth-field pleasing word.

48:48.900 --> 48:49.540
Runes.

48:50.500 --> 48:51.700
You know, this is the thing.

48:51.700 --> 48:53.940
I'm gonna real talk here for a second.

48:53.940 --> 48:56.340
I think the reason stuff like this upsets me so much

48:56.340 --> 48:59.220
is like when people talk about like crystals and runes and stuff

48:59.220 --> 49:01.060
is because there was a period of my life

49:01.060 --> 49:04.260
where I wanted this kind of thing to be true so hard.

49:04.980 --> 49:07.140
When you were jerking it to Xanth?

49:07.860 --> 49:08.100
Yeah.

49:10.100 --> 49:15.060
From age like 12 to like 17, where it's like, please, Matt, please.

49:15.060 --> 49:17.380
Please, please, please, please, crystal, do something.

49:17.380 --> 49:19.140
Please, crystal, do anything.

49:19.140 --> 49:21.380
I want Loch Ness Monster to be real.

49:21.380 --> 49:23.140
I want there to be runes and crystals.

49:23.140 --> 49:27.060
You had a box of crystals, if I'm not mistaken.

49:27.060 --> 49:29.060
Yes, I wanted it to be real, Griffin.

49:29.060 --> 49:31.460
I believed it so hard.

49:31.460 --> 49:33.620
And now I look back on that, Travis,

49:33.620 --> 49:36.420
and I'm like, fuck, fuck that dude.

49:36.420 --> 49:37.940
Well, I mean, are you mad at yourself?

49:37.940 --> 49:39.940
Are you mad at those fucking crystals for not producing?

49:41.140 --> 49:42.260
I mean, isn't that the case?

49:42.260 --> 49:45.140
Like, the thing is, it's like Amnesia Scrooge.

49:45.140 --> 49:48.020
I need like three crystal ghosts to come and teach it.

49:48.020 --> 49:48.900
It's like, remember?

49:49.460 --> 49:51.460
Remember when you loved crystals, Travis?

49:51.460 --> 49:52.980
Take my crystal in hand.

49:52.980 --> 49:54.820
Fly with me to Xanth.

49:54.820 --> 49:57.140
I'm going to show you the future of crystals.

49:57.140 --> 49:58.020
Still nothing.

49:58.020 --> 49:59.380
They're still not doing shit.

49:59.380 --> 50:02.740
They're still just like pretty translucent rocks.

50:02.740 --> 50:03.620
And that's great.

50:03.620 --> 50:07.060
I mean, be into that if you want to be into anything.

50:07.060 --> 50:09.700
I'm the crystalline ghost of the present.

50:09.700 --> 50:11.140
Still just crystals.

50:11.860 --> 50:15.540
I, for a while, I thought at that same age range,

50:15.540 --> 50:18.660
I thought I had psychic powers.

50:18.660 --> 50:19.380
Oh, sure.

50:19.380 --> 50:26.020
Oh, sure, no, when I look back at like my primary school career,

50:26.660 --> 50:30.020
I have a lot of regrets, but I think the number one regret

50:30.020 --> 50:32.740
is that I wish I wouldn't have fucking tried to move

50:32.740 --> 50:34.900
so much shit with my mind while I was just sort of

50:34.900 --> 50:35.780
standing in the hall.

50:36.660 --> 50:38.340
I think that was probably number one on the list

50:38.340 --> 50:41.300
when I was fucking, when I was like working safety patrol

50:41.300 --> 50:43.380
and making sure the kids got home from school.

50:43.380 --> 50:47.060
I wish I had stopped like trying to move leaves around

50:47.060 --> 50:50.260
with my hand from far away.

50:50.260 --> 50:54.020
I think that could have significantly improved your profile

50:54.660 --> 50:58.580
within the school if you were weird, leaf-wavy Griffin.

50:58.580 --> 50:59.060
But you know what?

50:59.060 --> 51:01.220
It's a gamble because if that shit had worked once.

51:02.180 --> 51:03.060
It only takes one.

51:03.060 --> 51:05.620
It only takes the one time, doesn't it?

51:05.620 --> 51:08.740
I actually have a very clear memory of talking to mom

51:09.380 --> 51:13.620
about my belief that I had psychic abilities.

51:13.620 --> 51:16.020
And then I described to her, I said,

51:16.020 --> 51:17.700
here, let me prove it.

51:17.700 --> 51:22.580
I described to her a gentleman who I believed

51:22.580 --> 51:25.540
had come into her office like suit color,

51:25.540 --> 51:27.700
hair color, the whole thing.

51:27.700 --> 51:34.100
I have a crystal clear memory of mom absolutely dodging

51:34.100 --> 51:37.780
whether or not a gentleman matching that exact description

51:38.340 --> 51:40.180
entered her office on that day.

51:40.740 --> 51:42.180
I knew what was up.

51:42.180 --> 51:45.220
She definitely in retrospect did not say no,

51:45.220 --> 51:46.580
that didn't happen.

51:46.580 --> 51:48.340
She kind of changed the subject.

51:48.340 --> 51:50.900
I think she was scared when I had.

51:50.900 --> 51:53.140
When we turned 15 and 18 respectively

51:54.180 --> 51:56.420
and you got like a big birthday party

51:56.420 --> 51:59.620
and I was like, well, why is 18 so important?

51:59.620 --> 52:03.220
And mom's response was, when you turn 18, you'll find out.

52:03.780 --> 52:06.500
And my immediate thought process was,

52:06.500 --> 52:08.980
oh shit, you get magic powers at 18.

52:09.700 --> 52:10.900
And they just haven't.

52:10.900 --> 52:14.340
I mean, you get the magic power of political enfranchisement.

52:14.340 --> 52:17.140
You get the magic power of smoking legally.

52:17.140 --> 52:18.740
You get the magical power of just like

52:20.180 --> 52:22.340
buying like physical pornography,

52:22.340 --> 52:23.620
which is like, I mean,

52:23.620 --> 52:25.940
basically the worst magic power at this point.

52:26.980 --> 52:29.860
But isn't it, isn't that like so like

52:29.860 --> 52:31.940
because of Harry Potter and shit like Xanthe

52:31.940 --> 52:33.140
and other kind of like where it's like,

52:34.740 --> 52:37.620
there's this whole other world of magic going on

52:37.620 --> 52:39.460
and only the people that truly believe

52:39.460 --> 52:40.900
and it's like, oh, okay, cool.

52:40.900 --> 52:44.500
So I'm just gonna really truly believe over here for a second

52:44.500 --> 52:46.260
and just wait for that to start.

52:46.260 --> 52:48.740
I mean, people wouldn't be writing about this magic shit

52:48.740 --> 52:50.420
if it wasn't a little bit real.

52:50.420 --> 52:51.860
It's gotta come from somewhere.

52:51.860 --> 52:53.220
What, should we just make it up?

52:53.220 --> 52:55.380
I'll just buy the one room

52:56.100 --> 52:57.540
and just carry it around in my pocket for a while

52:57.540 --> 52:58.260
and see how it feels.

52:59.060 --> 53:01.540
And if you're out there fucking casting dispersions,

53:01.540 --> 53:03.060
I want you to go into your closet

53:03.060 --> 53:05.060
and I want you to open that deep dark secret box

53:05.060 --> 53:08.340
that you have that like magnetic copper bracelet in

53:08.340 --> 53:11.220
that like moves your fucking inner johns around in your wrist

53:11.220 --> 53:13.940
to heal your diabetes.

53:13.940 --> 53:14.980
And then I want you to come back

53:14.980 --> 53:16.340
and listen to the rest of the podcast.

53:16.340 --> 53:17.300
Hey, you back?

53:17.300 --> 53:18.340
Yeah, that's what I thought.

53:18.340 --> 53:20.340
Yeah, guess he told you.

53:20.340 --> 53:22.100
I guess I told you Mr. Magnetic Bracelet

53:22.100 --> 53:24.180
everybody on fucking Earth had

53:24.180 --> 53:25.620
because Dr. Drew was like,

53:25.620 --> 53:28.660
guys, you gotta get down on these magnet bracelets.

53:29.300 --> 53:32.020
Moves your inner johns around in such a pleasing manner.

53:32.020 --> 53:34.980
There will probably be a max fun meetup at 25.

53:34.980 --> 53:36.820
Oh, max fun week is coming up.

53:36.820 --> 53:38.180
This is a good segue.

53:38.180 --> 53:41.140
With this talking about bonkers people

53:41.140 --> 53:43.220
who believe in magnet therapy.

53:43.220 --> 53:45.860
No, well, I think max fun listeners believe in magic.

53:46.420 --> 53:48.260
Hopefully, I like to speak.

53:48.260 --> 53:49.860
You know, if you're interested in this kind of stuff,

53:49.860 --> 53:52.020
check out Oh No, Ross and Kerry and the Max Fun Network.

53:52.020 --> 53:53.380
They cover this kind of stuff across the board.

53:53.380 --> 53:54.980
Max Fun, what's that?

53:54.980 --> 53:57.540
That sounds like a network podcast.

53:57.540 --> 53:58.660
Max Fun Network.

53:58.660 --> 54:00.100
That kind of sounds like a network.

54:00.980 --> 54:01.460
What do you want?

54:01.460 --> 54:03.540
Sounds like some kind of hive mind of comedy.

54:03.540 --> 54:04.580
What are you trying to sell me?

54:05.380 --> 54:06.900
Max Fun Week is coming up.

54:06.900 --> 54:10.420
We have a question about Max Fun Week.

54:10.420 --> 54:12.340
Let me just tell you real quick.

54:12.340 --> 54:15.300
Max Fun Week, October 15th through the 21st.

54:15.300 --> 54:17.140
Oh my God, that's a coming up.

54:18.100 --> 54:19.860
We got a bunch of activities.

54:21.140 --> 54:22.340
There's a trivia day.

54:22.340 --> 54:25.220
There's a day to leave reviews collectively.

54:25.220 --> 54:26.420
Collective review day.

54:28.020 --> 54:29.300
There's all kinds of fun stuff.

54:29.300 --> 54:30.500
We'll talk about it more here in a little bit,

54:30.500 --> 54:35.380
but there's gonna be a ton of meetups for everybody

54:35.380 --> 54:37.620
to get together with other Max Fun listeners

54:38.740 --> 54:43.620
and you can find one in your area and go enjoy it.

54:44.980 --> 54:46.180
So question.

54:46.180 --> 54:46.740
So question.

54:47.380 --> 54:50.260
There will probably be a Max Fun Week meetup,

54:50.260 --> 54:52.500
a 25 minute drive away from our home,

54:53.460 --> 54:56.500
but my husband doesn't want to go because it's a Sunday night.

54:57.060 --> 54:59.460
How can I convince my husband that it's okay

54:59.460 --> 55:01.940
to occasionally go out on a school night

55:01.940 --> 55:04.740
even though it might mess up our chore schedule?

55:04.740 --> 55:08.820
And that's from No Semi-Spontaneity in New Jersey.

55:08.820 --> 55:10.420
Do you guys do this?

55:10.420 --> 55:11.540
Yeah, here's the thing.

55:11.540 --> 55:14.340
It does feel like when you hit a certain age,

55:14.340 --> 55:16.260
okay, so when you hit like 18 and on,

55:16.260 --> 55:17.940
the school night thing kind of goes away

55:17.940 --> 55:18.900
and you're like, fuck it.

55:18.900 --> 55:19.940
I got a class tomorrow.

55:19.940 --> 55:20.580
I don't care.

55:20.580 --> 55:22.580
I'm just gonna sleep three hours and I'll be fine.

55:22.580 --> 55:23.780
Why would you sound like that?

55:24.340 --> 55:25.860
Because that's how I sounded in college

55:25.860 --> 55:27.780
because I had so many runes in my pockets.

55:27.780 --> 55:28.820
I couldn't move very quickly.

55:31.780 --> 55:32.660
Ah, Trav's coming.

55:33.300 --> 55:33.940
Here he comes.

55:33.940 --> 55:35.620
He's like a magic maraca.

55:35.620 --> 55:37.060
Ah, shit, it's the crystal guy.

55:37.780 --> 55:40.500
But then like you hit a certain point again

55:40.500 --> 55:42.500
where you're like, I have to do shit tomorrow.

55:42.500 --> 55:44.900
I think it's like at like 27, 28,

55:44.900 --> 55:46.740
where you're like, I gotta do stuff tomorrow.

55:46.740 --> 55:48.020
I don't really want to go out tonight.

55:48.580 --> 55:50.900
And it's like you hit that kind of invincible,

55:50.900 --> 55:52.420
I don't need any sleep age.

55:53.540 --> 55:54.500
I do that now.

55:54.500 --> 55:55.780
There is a definite like,

55:56.580 --> 55:59.460
there's a definite risk here though.

55:59.460 --> 56:05.540
Once you open up this particular, this lamp,

56:05.540 --> 56:07.380
once you let the genie out of this one,

56:08.340 --> 56:10.260
another thing I always wish for, go on.

56:12.100 --> 56:13.860
Where you realize like, hey, wait a minute.

56:13.860 --> 56:14.900
I went out tonight.

56:14.900 --> 56:16.900
I went out on a night when I have to work tomorrow.

56:16.900 --> 56:18.980
I could do this every night.

56:19.540 --> 56:21.860
I had a time, we had a time period

56:21.860 --> 56:24.660
where we were playing trivia in a bar

56:24.660 --> 56:26.580
and it started out as like a weekly thing.

56:26.580 --> 56:29.380
And then we found out that there were like trivia nights

56:29.380 --> 56:30.420
in other bars.

56:31.460 --> 56:33.700
So we started going like a couple times

56:33.700 --> 56:34.740
and then three times.

56:34.740 --> 56:37.460
And then there didn't need to be trivia.

56:37.460 --> 56:39.540
We just should be in a bar.

56:39.540 --> 56:41.300
And then all of a sudden we were a sitcom

56:41.300 --> 56:43.940
because we were at a bar every single night.

56:43.940 --> 56:45.620
And you kind of realize like, wait a minute.

56:45.620 --> 56:47.540
I've been at a bar every day this week.

56:47.540 --> 56:51.220
It would be a great scene in a sitcom

56:51.220 --> 56:52.820
if they sat down at the end of the week

56:52.820 --> 56:54.420
and like we're going through receipts.

56:54.420 --> 56:59.620
We're just like, honey, we spent $600 at a bar this week.

56:59.620 --> 57:02.900
I have to point out an important distinction though,

57:02.900 --> 57:05.380
Juice, and was it different bars

57:05.380 --> 57:06.260
that you were going to every night

57:06.260 --> 57:07.380
or was it the same bar?

57:08.020 --> 57:09.220
No, it was different bars.

57:09.220 --> 57:10.660
Okay, that's not what happened.

57:10.660 --> 57:12.260
Different bars and a Hooters.

57:12.260 --> 57:14.660
That's not what happens in sitcoms though

57:14.660 --> 57:16.980
where people just like show up to bars like,

57:16.980 --> 57:19.700
oh man, same clowns, different circus.

57:19.700 --> 57:22.500
And it's like, guys, go home.

57:22.500 --> 57:23.220
Just go.

57:23.220 --> 57:24.580
If How I Met Your Mother instead of just going

57:24.580 --> 57:26.260
to McLaren's in each episode,

57:26.260 --> 57:28.020
they were just like going to different bars

57:28.020 --> 57:30.580
because of some sort of unnatural compulsion.

57:32.740 --> 57:34.100
That's not a sitcom.

57:34.100 --> 57:37.380
That's a sit bummer, a sit bum.

57:37.380 --> 57:40.500
I think that having a night where you make a bad decision

57:40.500 --> 57:42.340
like, hey, I'm gonna stay out too late

57:42.340 --> 57:43.700
on a night when I have to work,

57:43.700 --> 57:46.980
just makes you appreciate and help break up

57:46.980 --> 57:50.580
the mundanity of all those other nights

57:50.580 --> 57:52.980
when you don't misbehave.

57:52.980 --> 57:54.900
I'm a big fan.

57:54.900 --> 57:55.940
I would also like to point out

57:55.940 --> 57:58.100
that the next fun meetup started 7 p.m.

58:00.980 --> 58:03.620
I don't wanna like throw shade and pass judgment here.

58:03.620 --> 58:06.340
Is that you fucking Wilford Brimley motherfucker?

58:06.340 --> 58:07.780
Maybe you should just go out.

58:08.580 --> 58:11.220
You could go out and be home.

58:11.220 --> 58:13.620
You could go out, stay out for three hours

58:13.620 --> 58:15.940
and still be home by 10.

58:15.940 --> 58:19.140
But 730 is when I watch Two Broke Girls

58:19.140 --> 58:20.340
and I start molting.

58:20.340 --> 58:24.180
I start the molting process at 730

58:24.180 --> 58:25.540
when Two Broke Girls comes on.

58:26.260 --> 58:27.060
I love that show.

58:27.060 --> 58:28.660
It's my favorite show to molt to.

58:31.300 --> 58:32.420
I can't wait to be dead.

58:37.220 --> 58:38.260
Thank you for listening to our show.

58:38.260 --> 58:39.220
I'm sorry I said all that stuff.

58:40.100 --> 58:42.740
That's gonna be our program,

58:42.740 --> 58:45.140
but we wanted to remind you,

58:45.140 --> 58:47.300
I don't know if we alluded to it before,

58:47.300 --> 58:50.340
Max Fun Week kicks off this Wednesday

58:50.340 --> 58:52.260
and there's a ton of really fun stuff happening.

58:53.380 --> 58:53.620
Great.

58:54.580 --> 58:56.740
Yeah, I'm just gonna run through the schedule real quick.

58:56.740 --> 58:59.860
If you go to maximumfun.org forward slash maxfunweek,

58:59.860 --> 59:00.820
it's all on there.

59:00.820 --> 59:02.180
It's broken down by the day.

59:02.180 --> 59:04.660
You can also follow Max Fun HQ on Twitter

59:05.300 --> 59:06.420
and they'll run you through everything.

59:06.420 --> 59:08.660
But basic schedule, Wednesday, October 15th

59:08.660 --> 59:10.020
is Max Fun Trivia Day.

59:10.020 --> 59:11.860
Max Fun HQ is going to be tweeting out

59:11.860 --> 59:12.900
different trivia questions.

59:12.900 --> 59:13.940
And if you're the first person

59:13.940 --> 59:15.300
to answer each question correctly,

59:15.300 --> 59:17.380
you'll be entered in a drawing.

59:17.380 --> 59:20.020
On Thursday, October 16th is Leave a Review Day.

59:20.020 --> 59:22.500
So we're encouraging everyone to go on iTunes

59:22.500 --> 59:23.540
and rate and review

59:24.100 --> 59:25.700
and just kind of get the word out of the show

59:25.700 --> 59:27.620
and talk about it on iTunes.

59:27.620 --> 59:31.060
You can also tweet iTunes podcast

59:31.780 --> 59:33.860
and tell them thank you for hosting the shows

59:33.860 --> 59:35.940
and all of that and tell them how great they are.

59:35.940 --> 59:37.380
On Friday, October 17th,

59:37.940 --> 59:40.740
it's Immediate Summary Judgment Day.

59:40.740 --> 59:43.140
So John Hodgman super fans

59:43.140 --> 59:45.220
and pop culture experts will really love this one.

59:45.220 --> 59:46.340
They'll post an audio clip.

59:46.340 --> 59:48.340
I think we can just say humans

59:48.340 --> 59:50.980
instead of John being John Hodgman super fans.

59:50.980 --> 59:52.820
Human beings will really like this one.

59:52.820 --> 59:54.180
They'll post an audio clip

59:54.180 --> 59:56.500
of one of John Hodgman's signature interpretations

59:56.500 --> 59:58.020
of cultural artifacts.

59:58.020 --> 01:00:00.580
And it's up to you to guess the reference.

01:00:00.580 --> 01:00:01.700
And the first correct answer

01:00:01.700 --> 01:00:03.300
gets entered in drawing for prizes.

01:00:03.300 --> 01:00:04.980
And so on Saturday, October 18th,

01:00:05.620 --> 01:00:08.820
if you listened to our Adventure Zone episode,

01:00:09.780 --> 01:00:12.260
well, and if you didn't, go do that, please.

01:00:12.260 --> 01:00:15.060
But if you did, then you'll be really interested

01:00:15.060 --> 01:00:18.260
in this one, we played D&D and stuff.

01:00:18.260 --> 01:00:19.460
But what they're asking you for

01:00:19.460 --> 01:00:21.460
is for people to draw, paint, sculpt,

01:00:21.460 --> 01:00:23.220
whatever medium you choose to work in,

01:00:23.860 --> 01:00:25.780
representations of the characters we played

01:00:25.780 --> 01:00:27.540
and the winning artist will get

01:00:27.540 --> 01:00:29.780
a fifth edition D&D players handbook

01:00:29.780 --> 01:00:31.140
signed by all three of us.

01:00:31.860 --> 01:00:33.140
So if that's something you're into,

01:00:33.140 --> 01:00:34.500
then there's a great opportunity.

01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:35.700
If not, it's just a fun way

01:00:35.700 --> 01:00:36.820
to show off your art to people.

01:00:36.820 --> 01:00:39.300
We'll put that shit on character sheets too, fuck it.

01:00:39.300 --> 01:00:40.500
Yeah, yeah, we will.

01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:41.860
And I assume that's something

01:00:41.860 --> 01:00:43.140
you're gonna either send to us

01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:44.500
or send to MaxFun HQ.

01:00:45.220 --> 01:00:46.100
But if you send it to us,

01:00:46.100 --> 01:00:47.780
we promise we'll get it to the right place.

01:00:47.780 --> 01:00:48.260
I won't.

01:00:48.980 --> 01:00:50.420
Griffin won't, just send it to me.

01:00:51.140 --> 01:00:53.540
So Sunday 19th, this is what we were talking about earlier.

01:00:53.540 --> 01:00:54.660
It's MaxFun Meetup Day.

01:00:54.660 --> 01:00:56.260
And all over the world,

01:00:56.820 --> 01:00:58.980
we're encouraging people to set up meetups

01:00:59.540 --> 01:01:01.060
and start at 7 p.m. local time.

01:01:01.700 --> 01:01:03.940
If you wanna host a meetup, you just pick a place

01:01:03.940 --> 01:01:06.900
and then contact Jennifer at MaximumFun.org

01:01:06.900 --> 01:01:07.860
and we'll spread the word.

01:01:07.860 --> 01:01:10.260
And just real quick, I wanna run through some of it.

01:01:10.260 --> 01:01:10.740
Some of them.

01:01:11.700 --> 01:01:14.020
There's a bunch in Canada,

01:01:14.820 --> 01:01:16.980
two in Alberta, one in Nova Scotia,

01:01:16.980 --> 01:01:18.500
one in France, one in Turkey.

01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:19.140
What the fuck?

01:01:19.140 --> 01:01:20.020
Is there one in Japan?

01:01:21.540 --> 01:01:22.020
I will look.

01:01:23.300 --> 01:01:25.700
There's one in Phoenix, one in Los Angeles,

01:01:25.700 --> 01:01:27.060
one in Oakland.

01:01:27.060 --> 01:01:29.620
There's one in Los Angeles, it's just for like families.

01:01:29.620 --> 01:01:32.340
It's during the day on the 19th, sorry, on the 18th.

01:01:32.900 --> 01:01:35.060

Cincinnati doesn't have one.

01:01:57.540 --> 01:02:00.500
So one, I'm really disappointed in you, Cincinnati.

01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:01.780
I'm looking at you, Kyle Ross.

01:02:02.340 --> 01:02:02.820
Whoa.

01:02:02.820 --> 01:02:05.060
Yeah, Kyle Ross.

01:02:05.060 --> 01:02:06.740
Host one in Cincinnati, you fool.

01:02:06.740 --> 01:02:08.180
Get one in Huntington, Justin.

01:02:08.180 --> 01:02:10.420
I got a baby.

01:02:10.420 --> 01:02:11.940
So set those up and go hang out.

01:02:12.500 --> 01:02:14.740
I've been to a couple, they're always fun to be around

01:02:14.740 --> 01:02:16.340
other people who love the thing that you love.

01:02:16.340 --> 01:02:18.660
It's a great way to make new friends in your city

01:02:18.660 --> 01:02:20.980
or just get together and kind of have a fun evening

01:02:20.980 --> 01:02:22.980
talking about stuff that you feel comfortable talking about.

01:02:23.700 --> 01:02:26.660
Also, Max Fun fans are like the fucking coolest people.

01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:27.940
Yeah, they're like the best people.

01:02:27.940 --> 01:02:30.820
We're the most uncomfortable, like socially speaking,

01:02:30.820 --> 01:02:33.140
human beings on Earth and I still have a great time

01:02:33.140 --> 01:02:36.340
every time I meet people in Max Fun community.

01:02:36.340 --> 01:02:39.940
So on Monday, October 20th is Share Your Favorite Episode Day.

01:02:39.940 --> 01:02:41.780

01:02:41.780 --> 01:02:45.140
or anything like that, just tweet it out, go on Reddit,

01:02:45.140 --> 01:02:48.260
talk about it on the Max Fun forums, whatever you want to do.

01:02:48.260 --> 01:02:49.620
Just get the word out and tell all your friends

01:02:49.620 --> 01:02:51.060
about the episode, share a link to it.

01:02:52.420 --> 01:02:53.540
It's just a day to kind of say,

01:02:53.540 --> 01:02:55.380
hey, I've never mentioned this to you before,

01:02:55.380 --> 01:02:57.700

01:02:57.700 --> 01:02:59.300

01:03:05.700 --> 01:03:07.300
of Max Fun Rocket, you color it in,

01:03:08.100 --> 01:03:10.580
and the winning artist will get a prize.

01:03:10.580 --> 01:03:13.140

01:03:25.220 --> 01:03:26.820
I don't know what time that is, Eastern.

01:03:26.820 --> 01:03:28.660
What are you guys on, Eastern time?

01:03:28.660 --> 01:03:30.980
I'll listen to Hollywood tribes and microwave.

01:03:30.980 --> 01:03:31.860

01:03:31.860 --> 01:03:34.340
But yeah, come hang out with us and ask us questions.

01:03:34.340 --> 01:03:37.460
You can literally ask us anything, not about poop.

01:03:39.220 --> 01:03:41.460
But there's AMAs every day of that week.

01:03:42.100 --> 01:03:44.100

It's a show about people taking matters into their own hands,

01:06:14.660 --> 01:06:17.540
and we're really excited to be bringing it to Maximum Fun.

01:06:18.100 --> 01:06:21.060
You know, having that experience of I can do that

01:06:21.060 --> 01:06:23.140
makes me feel like I can almost do anything.

01:06:23.140 --> 01:06:25.220
Here at Destination DIY,

01:06:25.220 --> 01:06:27.460
we like to push the do it yourself envelope

01:06:27.460 --> 01:06:29.300
beyond crafts and home improvement.
