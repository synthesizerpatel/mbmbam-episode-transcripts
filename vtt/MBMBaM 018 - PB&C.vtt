00:00.000 --> 00:05.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.560 --> 00:11.080
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.080 --> 00:16.360
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how

00:16.360 --> 00:18.480
cool they are for listening.

00:18.480 --> 00:19.480
What's up, you cool baby?

00:19.480 --> 00:30.880
If you change your mind, I'm the first in line Honey, I'm still free, take a chance

00:30.880 --> 00:35.880
on me If you need me, let me know, I'm gonna be

00:35.880 --> 00:40.880
around If you got no place to go, when you're feeling

00:40.880 --> 00:43.880
down If you're all alone, when the pretty birds

00:43.880 --> 00:47.880
have flown Honey, I'm still free, take a chance on me

00:47.880 --> 00:52.880
I think you're exactly where you need to be, because today is August 15th, and you're listening

00:52.880 --> 00:53.880
to my brother, my brother, and me.

00:53.880 --> 00:56.880
Well, you probably won't hear it until the 16th, but God, the 15th.

00:56.880 --> 01:00.640
If you heard it today, today's the day where it's really fresh.

01:00.640 --> 01:04.160
This is an advice show for the modern era.

01:04.160 --> 01:11.560
I am your semi-host, one of three hosts, Justin McElroy.

01:11.560 --> 01:18.440
I'm another partial host, half-host, third host, Travis McElroy.

01:18.440 --> 01:22.080
I'm a, I'm quasi-host, Griffin McElroy.

01:22.080 --> 01:23.760
Oh, that's a good one.

01:23.760 --> 01:24.760
That's a good one, Tim.

01:24.760 --> 01:25.760
That was way better.

01:25.760 --> 01:26.760
You and your words.

01:26.760 --> 01:27.760
Mm-hmm.

01:27.760 --> 01:28.760
Where you get them words from?

01:28.760 --> 01:30.400
Where you get them, all those words?

01:30.400 --> 01:33.240
I read lots of thesauruses.

01:33.240 --> 01:34.240
Slow down.

01:34.240 --> 01:38.640
I didn't want a whole life story, it scares me, one of the words.

01:38.640 --> 01:40.560
You go ahead and keep that locked up, son.

01:40.560 --> 01:45.040
Hey, how do you guys feel about helping some people out with their lives today?

01:45.040 --> 01:46.040
I would-

01:46.040 --> 01:47.040
Do I have to help them move?

01:47.040 --> 01:48.040
Nope, nope, nope.

01:48.040 --> 01:52.320
There will be actually no effort required, either physical or mental.

01:52.320 --> 01:53.320
My brother and my brother-

01:53.320 --> 01:54.320
You just said the secret word.

01:54.320 --> 01:57.320
We'll always help you, just not with moving.

01:57.320 --> 01:58.320
Or money.

01:58.320 --> 02:01.440
We don't even help each other with moving, we can avoid it.

02:01.440 --> 02:02.440
Yeah.

02:02.440 --> 02:03.440
Yeah.

02:03.440 --> 02:04.440
I've moved too many people in my life.

02:04.440 --> 02:05.440
Whatever.

02:05.440 --> 02:11.160
You two bastards move every few weeks, Justin, come to this family.

02:11.160 --> 02:12.720
I gotta throw them off, Justin.

02:12.720 --> 02:13.720
The carpet looked-

02:13.720 --> 02:14.720
I've been staying in one place for too long.

02:14.720 --> 02:15.720
The carpet looked at me wrong.

02:15.720 --> 02:16.720
I'm out.

02:16.720 --> 02:22.100
Chris, Chris via Gmail asks, I find myself feeling horribly embarrassed when I'm with

02:22.100 --> 02:27.420
a girl who says something that doesn't live up to my exacting standards of wit and charm.

02:27.420 --> 02:29.080
Where can I go to meet some intelligent women?

02:29.080 --> 02:33.360
I was honestly considering going back for my post-graduate degree in the hopes of meeting

02:33.360 --> 02:34.360
someone.

02:34.360 --> 02:35.360
I know that Justin is with us-

02:35.360 --> 02:36.360
That's not a good reason.

02:36.360 --> 02:37.360
That's not a good reason.

02:37.360 --> 02:39.080
I know Justin is with a smart lady.

02:39.080 --> 02:44.040
Where do people like her go to socialize because I haven't met them where I'm at?

02:44.040 --> 02:45.040
Chris, Gmail.

02:45.040 --> 02:47.600
Here's the thing, Chris.

02:47.600 --> 02:54.120
You're looking at bars, nobody's smart when they're in a bar because they went on the

02:54.120 --> 02:58.680
booze on the sauce.

02:58.680 --> 03:04.200
If I've learned one thing from Ernest Hemingway, smartest people are the stupidest drunks.

03:04.200 --> 03:07.120
So it's true.

03:07.120 --> 03:08.120
And he was impotent.

03:08.120 --> 03:11.520
It might seem stupid there, but he was what?

03:11.520 --> 03:13.660
He was impotent.

03:13.660 --> 03:14.660
It's pronounced important.

03:14.660 --> 03:15.660
No, it was impotent.

03:15.660 --> 03:16.660
Impotent.

03:16.660 --> 03:21.800
That has literally nothing to do with this situation, but it's all I know about Ernest

03:21.800 --> 03:22.800
Hemingway.

03:22.800 --> 03:23.800
He may not even be impotent.

03:23.800 --> 03:24.800
Let's move on.

03:24.800 --> 03:25.800
I prefer Papa.

03:25.800 --> 03:32.000
That's how I always think of him.

03:32.000 --> 03:40.400
The thing about this question is of the qualities that are worth looking for in a person.

03:40.400 --> 03:48.120
I think intelligence is good, but I don't think it's a number one thing.

03:48.120 --> 03:52.700
If that's what you're looking for for a connection, I don't know if that should be your number

03:52.700 --> 03:55.440
one standard.

03:55.440 --> 03:56.440
Intelligence is like humor.

03:56.440 --> 03:57.440
It's relative.

03:57.440 --> 03:58.440
You know what I mean?

03:58.440 --> 04:05.120
I mean, people that have never read The Great Gatsby, but their street smarts, their common

04:05.120 --> 04:07.160
sense is off the charts.

04:07.160 --> 04:08.560
You know what I mean?

04:08.560 --> 04:12.720
A lot of my friends can't do math, but they're way smarter than I am.

04:12.720 --> 04:18.120
And there are so many people out there in the world who are wicked stoops, who are with

04:18.120 --> 04:21.720
somebody who's similarly wicked stoops.

04:21.720 --> 04:24.920
And if one of their girlfriends asks them, is he smart?

04:24.920 --> 04:29.280
She said, yeah, he's got a beautiful mind the way it works.

04:29.280 --> 04:30.960
You wouldn't even believe it.

04:30.960 --> 04:31.960
He says these things.

04:31.960 --> 04:33.600
I don't know where he comes up with them.

04:33.600 --> 04:34.600
It's beautiful.

04:34.600 --> 04:42.040
He's just, he's quoting rush lyrics, really just quoting rush lyrics for Y Y Z.

04:42.040 --> 04:49.760
So Chris, to answer your question, just, um, you know, I don't know where do smart people

04:49.760 --> 04:50.760
hang out?

04:50.760 --> 04:58.920
Starbucks, don't go back to, don't go back to, uh, I think Starbucks is not a bad idea.

04:58.920 --> 05:01.280
Do people really hang out at Starbucks?

05:01.280 --> 05:05.080
I do just to do, yeah, I'm, I'm there on the rack.

05:05.080 --> 05:06.080
I always thought that was a myth.

05:06.080 --> 05:07.080
No.

05:07.080 --> 05:09.280
Well, I go there to wheeze off the internet sometimes.

05:09.280 --> 05:10.280
Yeah.

05:10.280 --> 05:15.040
When you work from home and have literally zero human contact, you have to, you have

05:15.040 --> 05:20.160
to make a pilgrimage to the box or got to get the box to get that human connection.

05:20.160 --> 05:22.720
So sometimes I just, I don't even get a drink.

05:22.720 --> 05:26.920
I just rub up against people and hey, no one says you have to be pursuing your graduate

05:26.920 --> 05:29.120
degree to hang out on college campuses.

05:29.120 --> 05:30.120
Trust me.

05:30.120 --> 05:32.560
You just have to be faster than campus police.

05:32.560 --> 05:42.520
Hey Phil, there's a guy, that guy again, who that guy is always with the wide, that's

05:42.520 --> 05:43.560
PD one with this.

05:43.560 --> 05:45.480
He never has any books ever.

05:45.480 --> 05:48.680
That's why he's so fast.

05:48.680 --> 05:52.400
We're used to catching people with books, even have any, he just has sunglasses and

05:52.400 --> 05:53.400
a wide brim hat.

05:53.400 --> 05:58.400
He was just hanging out by the, by the quad playing guitar.

05:58.400 --> 06:01.000
Hey, I, uh, I took a trip home.

06:01.000 --> 06:06.760
I go once a year and my best friend of almost 10 years bailed on me the entire time.

06:06.760 --> 06:09.680
He has a new girlfriend, just moved in together.

06:09.680 --> 06:12.780
How do I handle this using the least amount of curse words possible?

06:12.780 --> 06:13.780
I'm a girl.

06:13.780 --> 06:16.960
If that matters, that totally matters.

06:16.960 --> 06:19.680
Uh, hey, that totally matters.

06:19.680 --> 06:21.400
Of course it matters.

06:21.400 --> 06:22.880
Let's course.

06:22.880 --> 06:24.880
Let's break down the sentence structure here.

06:24.880 --> 06:26.520
Let's break down the actual question.

06:26.520 --> 06:27.520
Yeah.

06:27.520 --> 06:31.640
The important, most verbatim, most important sentence in there.

06:31.640 --> 06:35.800
He has a new girlfriend, just moved in together.

06:35.800 --> 06:39.480
I am a girl.

06:39.480 --> 06:40.960
Like your friend did not bail on you.

06:40.960 --> 06:43.160
Your friend is protecting his relationship.

06:43.160 --> 06:44.160
Yeah.

06:44.160 --> 06:45.160
Yeah.

06:45.160 --> 06:46.160
Sorry lady.

06:46.160 --> 06:53.560
The, the whole, like, no matter how secure somebody is in their relationship, I, I,

06:53.560 --> 06:57.360
and I wholeheartedly believe this, no matter how secure somebody is in their relationship,

06:57.360 --> 07:06.680
it is really hard for them to handle their SO, their significant other being friends

07:06.680 --> 07:12.580
with, especially best friends with someone of the opposite sex, especially if they're

07:12.580 --> 07:14.960
not also friends with them.

07:14.960 --> 07:22.380
Because for starters, they probably think they should be their bestie, you know, they,

07:22.380 --> 07:23.720
they should be your best friend.

07:23.720 --> 07:30.160
So that's, and that's probably, and they should, you psycho, no, they should be, they should

07:30.160 --> 07:32.080
be their best friend.

07:32.080 --> 07:33.820
So yeah, of course you're going to feel threatened.

07:33.820 --> 07:36.520
Of course it has everything to do with it.

07:36.520 --> 07:42.400
And what you need to know is it's not that you can't still be his friend, but you have

07:42.400 --> 07:47.840
to be sensitive to the fact that he is, you know, especially if he just moved in with

07:47.840 --> 07:52.340
his girl, they have reached this new plateau and like they, you know, are getting used

07:52.340 --> 07:54.000
to each other and dealing with that.

07:54.000 --> 07:57.560
Be sensitive to that fact and don't try to rush in and be like, why are you hanging out

07:57.560 --> 07:58.560
with that biddy?

07:58.560 --> 08:00.040
Hang out with me.

08:00.040 --> 08:01.440
You gotta be cool, homie.

08:01.440 --> 08:05.640
Hey, plateau is totally the best word for that by the way.

08:05.640 --> 08:06.640
Yeah.

08:06.640 --> 08:10.440
You can keep the other plateaus.

08:10.440 --> 08:12.800
It's like a serious steps or just a series of plateaus.

08:12.800 --> 08:19.840
If you think about it, I think that's a great NBNBA motivational poster, reach for the plateaus.

08:19.840 --> 08:25.880
My advice in this situation, my, my advice, I can't tell you to, to move away.

08:25.880 --> 08:31.640
Um, but I can tell you that you already did the best that you could do was move away.

08:31.640 --> 08:34.120
So you are, you did step one, which is pack your bags and move away.

08:34.120 --> 08:36.160
Step two, never ever go home again.

08:36.160 --> 08:37.160
You're done there.

08:37.160 --> 08:39.680
They say you can't go home again and for you that has become literal.

08:39.680 --> 08:40.680
You can't.

08:40.680 --> 08:41.680
You just can't.

08:41.680 --> 08:42.680
He's dead now.

08:42.680 --> 08:43.680
It's actually, you shouldn't go home again.

08:43.680 --> 08:44.680
What happened to my best friend, Jerry?

08:44.680 --> 08:45.680
It doesn't matter.

08:45.680 --> 08:46.680
He's dead now.

08:46.680 --> 08:47.680
He's dead to you.

08:47.680 --> 08:48.680
He's gone.

08:48.680 --> 08:49.680
He's dead to you.

08:49.680 --> 08:50.680
For all intents and purposes.

08:50.680 --> 08:53.320
They told me on this podcast I listened to that he died.

08:53.320 --> 08:54.320
It was very peaceful.

08:54.320 --> 08:59.400
Yahoo answers Yahoo answers user Ashley P. Uh, this question was sent in by a Twitter

08:59.400 --> 09:01.200
user that Garrett kid.

09:01.200 --> 09:02.200
So thank you.

09:02.200 --> 09:03.200
That Garrett kid.

09:03.200 --> 09:06.280
Uh, Ashley P asks, is this true?

09:06.280 --> 09:10.680
My mom said that after you have sex, you won't grow taller anymore.

09:10.680 --> 09:15.600
Example, get taller.

09:15.600 --> 09:16.600
That's completely true.

09:16.600 --> 09:18.720
That is completely true.

09:18.720 --> 09:20.760
You're spitting out all your bones, right?

09:20.760 --> 09:21.760
Yeah.

09:21.760 --> 09:23.360
That's what makes your bones is your bone juice.

09:23.360 --> 09:27.600
They call it, they call it boning down because it literally compresses your bones when you

09:27.600 --> 09:28.600
do it.

09:28.600 --> 09:29.600
Yeah, that is correct.

09:29.600 --> 09:33.040
And once you break the seal, you're done.

09:33.040 --> 09:35.600
So you actually start shrinking.

09:35.600 --> 09:36.600
Yeah.

09:36.600 --> 09:37.600
Yes.

09:37.600 --> 09:38.960
Constantly keep blinking all the time.

09:38.960 --> 09:44.200
Do you know how like old old people are really small if they only get like that because they're

09:44.200 --> 09:52.680
total sluts osteoporosis more like hosteo ho porous is whore.

09:52.680 --> 10:00.960
You old whore old whore by the way, Rupa clan and was three feet tall at her desk.

10:00.960 --> 10:03.960
That's why she didn't get more TV appearances.

10:03.960 --> 10:04.960
That's a fact.

10:04.960 --> 10:08.840
You ever see that episode where Blanche was like, I can fit through a mouse hole.

10:08.840 --> 10:14.520
It's too soon to joke about that.

10:14.520 --> 10:15.520
Is it?

10:15.520 --> 10:16.520
It's never too soon.

10:16.520 --> 10:17.520
It's a little too soon.

10:17.520 --> 10:23.280
Is it too soon for her to hop back in bed with the guy after guy after guy after guy

10:23.280 --> 10:24.680
until she was two feet tall.

10:24.680 --> 10:27.440
Didn't I go to bed with Rupa clan again?

10:27.440 --> 10:28.440
She's gone.

10:28.440 --> 10:29.440
She's not gone.

10:29.440 --> 10:30.440
She's at the bed.

10:30.440 --> 10:34.680
Actually, she's boning down that Indian from Indian in the cupboard.

10:34.680 --> 10:37.840
What the fuck, man?

10:37.840 --> 10:38.840
That's where he went.

10:38.840 --> 10:43.720
Travis with those classic literature references, that's the easier guy.

10:43.720 --> 10:48.000
To be fair, I was just hitting the times by watching my audacity go across the screen

10:48.000 --> 10:49.800
and Indian in the cupboard popped into my head.

10:49.800 --> 10:55.800
I am just going to go ahead and apologize.

10:55.800 --> 10:58.280
We all need to we all need to get our heads back in the game.

10:58.280 --> 11:01.720
Yeah, I can tell we're starting to we're starting to drift a little bit.

11:01.720 --> 11:06.120
Where do you think that started?

11:06.120 --> 11:07.120
It's hard to say.

11:07.120 --> 11:09.360
Hey, I have a problem with my name is from Gmail.

11:09.360 --> 11:11.920
I'm going to guess it's from Sarah from Gmail.

11:11.920 --> 11:13.000
I have a problem with my name.

11:13.000 --> 11:16.460
I find my legal name, Sarah, to be too boring.

11:16.460 --> 11:20.920
So for years I've gone by Sashi pronounced Sashi.

11:20.920 --> 11:23.720
Sorry, I shouldn't read that part.

11:23.720 --> 11:28.160
However, people seem to be easily confused by my nickname is I've seen it misspelled

11:28.160 --> 11:35.640
myriad ways, Sushi, Sasha, Shashi, Shawshank.

11:35.640 --> 11:39.840
And perhaps more frustratingly, people tend to think it's a man's name.

11:39.840 --> 11:42.500
What should I do?

11:42.500 --> 11:47.380
Become a more boring person to fit my legal name, undergo a sex change or legally change

11:47.380 --> 11:49.560
my name to Sushi.

11:49.560 --> 11:51.000
Help Gmail.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.480
Where does a sex change come into the equation?

11:54.480 --> 11:56.040
She just wanted to slip that in there.

11:56.040 --> 11:58.880
That's what she's really asking about.

11:58.880 --> 12:01.600
Listen here, Sushi.

12:01.600 --> 12:04.200
Don't get a sex change.

12:04.200 --> 12:06.720
That's not going to help your problem at all.

12:06.720 --> 12:09.920
I think Sarah is an OK name.

12:09.920 --> 12:12.360
But maybe that's the problem is that it's just an OK name.

12:12.360 --> 12:14.200
There's so many of them.

12:14.200 --> 12:21.520
Listen, Hashish, there is never a time in your life where your behavior is dictated

12:21.520 --> 12:22.760
by your first name.

12:22.760 --> 12:25.680
If you're living your life that way, you're doing it wrong.

12:25.680 --> 12:26.680
That's so not true.

12:26.680 --> 12:31.880
Unless your name is dictated, then you're just awesome.

12:31.880 --> 12:36.360
I really am of the opinion that half of the things that happen to you in your life are

12:36.360 --> 12:37.880
because of your first name.

12:37.880 --> 12:38.880
Wow.

12:38.880 --> 12:39.880
Really?

12:39.880 --> 12:40.880
Yeah.

12:40.880 --> 12:44.880
I think if you have a dull first name, you've got to work harder to make awesome things

12:44.880 --> 12:45.960
happen for you.

12:45.960 --> 12:46.960
That's true.

12:46.960 --> 12:48.840
Does that make sense?

12:48.840 --> 12:54.240
If you're looking at a list of people who you're going to hire for a job, they're all

12:54.240 --> 13:04.120
equally qualified, one's named Steven, one is named Robert, and then one is named Pygmalion.

13:04.120 --> 13:07.160
Which one of those three guys are you going to pick?

13:07.160 --> 13:09.360
The trick question, it's Rob.

13:09.360 --> 13:10.360
It is Robert.

13:10.360 --> 13:11.360
You got it.

13:11.360 --> 13:12.360
Damn it.

13:12.360 --> 13:13.360
Do you know why you pick Robert?

13:13.360 --> 13:14.360
Why?

13:14.360 --> 13:15.360
Why?

13:15.360 --> 13:16.360
I didn't.

13:16.360 --> 13:17.360
He's more qualified.

13:17.360 --> 13:18.360
I don't know.

13:18.360 --> 13:19.360
I was hoping you would have.

13:19.360 --> 13:29.240
I think the problem that you're running into, Sasha, is that the reason people use boring,

13:29.240 --> 13:33.440
standardized names is to save their children the embarrassment of having to explain their

13:33.440 --> 13:39.520
names to people and to help make their names a little more, you know, to streamline their

13:39.520 --> 13:42.920
life experience, let's say that.

13:42.920 --> 13:44.760
You need to change your name.

13:44.760 --> 13:48.560
The problem with Sasha is, of course, that it's not a word.

13:48.560 --> 13:49.560
It's not.

13:49.560 --> 13:50.560
You can say it all day.

13:50.560 --> 13:51.560
It's not going to make it a word.

13:51.560 --> 13:52.560
It's made up gibberish.

13:52.560 --> 13:53.560
Just gibberish.

13:53.560 --> 13:54.760
She's like a crazy person.

13:54.760 --> 14:02.600
So what you need to do is pick a new name that is a word already but is also your name.

14:02.600 --> 14:05.960
And I know that you came to us for this purpose.

14:05.960 --> 14:13.840
So now we're going to go round Robin for you and suggest to you a new name that you can

14:13.840 --> 14:18.200
use that's going to be impactful.

14:18.200 --> 14:27.040
It's going to make a difference with people, but they're also going to know what it is.

14:27.040 --> 14:30.520
And Griffin, let's start with you.

14:30.520 --> 14:34.480
What should Habib's new name be?

14:34.480 --> 14:35.720
Dominique.

14:35.720 --> 14:36.880
Whoa.

14:36.880 --> 14:42.720
Yeah, let that one just roll between your lips.

14:42.720 --> 14:45.200
It feels so good to say it.

14:45.200 --> 14:46.200
Dominique.

14:46.200 --> 14:48.880
I like to say it like that, too, as if it's kind of a question.

14:48.880 --> 14:52.320
Hey, whatever happened to Dominique?

14:52.320 --> 14:56.800
The first five letters are all lowercase, and the remainder is all uppercase.

14:56.800 --> 14:58.260
That's how people will know.

14:58.260 --> 15:00.360
What I like about that is it serves two purposes.

15:00.360 --> 15:04.960
It can be her name and then the name of her clothing line.

15:04.960 --> 15:06.960
Dominique.

15:06.960 --> 15:08.200
It's her clothing line.

15:08.200 --> 15:09.520
Oh, wow.

15:09.520 --> 15:14.120
You have got upper-level management written all over you, Griffin.

15:14.120 --> 15:16.160
I'm not giving her a name.

15:16.160 --> 15:18.640
I'm building an empire.

15:18.640 --> 15:22.080
It's about a brand, okay?

15:22.080 --> 15:30.080
I'm of course going to go with Benigans because they closed, so they don't need the name anymore,

15:30.080 --> 15:32.440
but people still have some pretty good feelings about it.

15:32.440 --> 15:35.060
They had a good Monte Cristo.

15:35.060 --> 15:36.060
I love it.

15:36.060 --> 15:37.060
I love it.

15:37.060 --> 15:38.240
But here's the problem.

15:38.240 --> 15:43.160
It's not going to solve her being confused for a man problem.

15:43.160 --> 15:45.520
She's property of Benigan.

15:45.520 --> 15:46.520
That's easy.

15:46.520 --> 15:47.520
I've got it.

15:47.520 --> 15:48.520
Well, I guess it is.

15:48.520 --> 15:49.520
I've got it.

15:49.520 --> 15:50.520
How to solve the man problem.

15:50.520 --> 15:51.520
Okay.

15:51.520 --> 15:52.520
Okay.

15:52.520 --> 15:53.520
Here's the name.

15:53.520 --> 15:54.520
Lady Farquhar, Duchess of York.

15:54.520 --> 15:55.840
Now, why does that fix anything?

15:55.840 --> 16:01.720
Well, because it's got lady and duchess right in there, so it's clearly a female's name.

16:01.720 --> 16:03.680
How about Lady Benigans?

16:03.680 --> 16:08.640
Lady Benigans of Dominique.

16:08.640 --> 16:13.240
How about TGI Fridays?

16:13.240 --> 16:14.240
Follow me.

16:14.240 --> 16:15.240
Follow me.

16:15.240 --> 16:16.240
Follow me.

16:16.240 --> 16:17.240
I'm going somewhere with this.

16:17.240 --> 16:18.240
Okay.

16:18.240 --> 16:19.240
Applebee's.

16:19.240 --> 16:20.240
So, you weren't going anywhere.

16:20.240 --> 16:21.240
Okay.

16:21.240 --> 16:22.240
P.F.

16:22.240 --> 16:23.240
Changs.

16:23.240 --> 16:24.240
Okay.

16:24.240 --> 16:26.200
Speaking of people with names.

16:26.200 --> 16:27.740
Outback Steakhouse.

16:27.740 --> 16:31.800
This next email comes to us from Lask via Gmail.

16:31.800 --> 16:32.800
That's fucking awesome.

16:32.800 --> 16:34.800
Which is a pretty good name.

16:34.800 --> 16:38.920
I'm getting ready to pop the question, the marriage one.

16:38.920 --> 16:39.920
Thanks, man.

16:39.920 --> 16:40.920
I knew.

16:40.920 --> 16:41.920
Piece it together.

16:41.920 --> 16:43.280
I'm ready to pop the question.

16:43.280 --> 16:44.280
To my princess.

16:44.280 --> 16:45.400
Piece it together.

16:45.400 --> 16:49.400
But I'm dreadfully boring, and she's made it clear that the proposal has to be special,

16:49.400 --> 16:53.040
not some ho-hum, hey, you want to marry me thing.

16:53.040 --> 16:59.600
Do you guys have any ideas how to make it sufficiently amazing, Dominique, and wonderful?

16:59.600 --> 17:06.040
I think, hey, you want to marry me is a great proposal, but get a Skyrider to do it.

17:06.040 --> 17:07.040
Yeah.

17:07.040 --> 17:11.320
Hey, you got anything to do in like a year and a half, want to get married?

17:11.320 --> 17:12.320
This is the one.

17:12.320 --> 17:13.320
Great.

17:13.320 --> 17:15.240
You have to fake your own death for two years.

17:15.240 --> 17:17.880
Oh my God, I love this.

17:17.880 --> 17:22.680
And then two years after, you have to fake your death on like whatever anniversary of

17:22.680 --> 17:23.680
coming up.

17:23.680 --> 17:27.840
Two years to the day on your anniversary, you come back with a wedding ring.

17:27.840 --> 17:29.600
She will be floored.

17:29.600 --> 17:32.560
But make sure when you fake your death, it's something like really tragic, where it'll

17:32.560 --> 17:34.800
take her like a solid three years to get over you.

17:34.800 --> 17:35.800
Yeah, because-

17:35.800 --> 17:36.800
You don't want her to start-

17:36.800 --> 17:37.800
It's got to hurt bad, man.

17:37.800 --> 17:40.280
You got to ruin her, just really wreck her.

17:40.280 --> 17:41.760
It's got to be her fault.

17:41.760 --> 17:43.480
Oh, yes.

17:43.480 --> 17:45.480
I told you to do the dishes.

17:45.480 --> 17:50.880
I fell over on the dishwasher like that dude's mom in Garden State.

17:50.880 --> 17:53.240
I have a better idea.

17:53.240 --> 17:54.240
Actually die.

17:54.240 --> 17:55.240
Whoa.

17:55.240 --> 17:56.240
Whoa.

17:56.240 --> 17:57.240
Make her marry your ashes.

17:57.240 --> 17:59.720
And then have your twin brother propose marriage to her.

17:59.720 --> 18:01.200
But it's actually you.

18:01.200 --> 18:02.640
But no, wait.

18:02.640 --> 18:04.760
Okay, there's some holes in my plan.

18:04.760 --> 18:08.600
There are some definite holes.

18:08.600 --> 18:15.120
I think the main thing to do is to remember that she is going to be repeating this story

18:15.120 --> 18:21.280
to people over and over and over, and you're going to have to repeat it over and over and

18:21.280 --> 18:22.280
over again.

18:22.280 --> 18:25.360
And I cannot tell you how many people I've talked to, and I asked like, so how'd you

18:25.360 --> 18:26.360
do it?

18:26.360 --> 18:30.880
And they're just, well, I don't know, we're just at dinner, and I was like, hey, what

18:30.880 --> 18:31.880
about this?

18:31.880 --> 18:33.880
And they're like, okay, fine.

18:33.880 --> 18:35.800
And then that was it.

18:35.800 --> 18:38.680
And you need to bring the heat.

18:38.680 --> 18:43.800
It's not about being boring, and it's not so much about being creative, I think.

18:43.800 --> 18:46.940
It's about effort.

18:46.940 --> 18:51.600
You have to come up with something where it's clear you thought about it and put some work

18:51.600 --> 18:52.600
into it.

18:52.600 --> 18:56.480
Let me suggest this last, this is not a joke.

18:56.480 --> 19:04.100
Look in your area in the yellow pages to see if there are any quartets or sometimes very

19:04.100 --> 19:05.100
large quartets.

19:05.100 --> 19:10.680
On my wife, the first Valentine's Day we were together, I had a 20-member quartet.

19:10.680 --> 19:14.840
They call it a very large quartet, which is funny.

19:14.840 --> 19:19.480
It's the best joke that people in large singing groups have, it's a very large quartet, came

19:19.480 --> 19:22.640
and sang to her on Valentine's Day.

19:22.640 --> 19:26.040
Now did I regret that for all the years following when I had trouble topping it?

19:26.040 --> 19:27.400
Yeah, you bet.

19:27.400 --> 19:28.960
But that's okay for this.

19:28.960 --> 19:30.520
This is one where you can go all out.

19:30.520 --> 19:34.600
So I say call a quartet to do it.

19:34.600 --> 19:38.600
Not only think about what's in your area and what's available, think about her.

19:38.600 --> 19:45.160
You know her pretty well, what it will make it specific to her and not a real, in general,

19:45.160 --> 19:46.600
do you want to marry me thing.

19:46.600 --> 19:52.440
What is a specific thing you can do that only she would appreciate?

19:52.440 --> 19:57.600
Or you could do what Dude It's Coke did and get us to ask her for you.

19:57.600 --> 19:59.080
We are always here for this.

19:59.080 --> 20:01.280
If you need us, we are here for you.

20:01.280 --> 20:07.300
I've seen enough TV to know that you shouldn't hide the wedding ring in some sort of food

20:07.300 --> 20:10.760
item in a table, like mashed potatoes.

20:10.760 --> 20:12.440
This Vichyssoise is crunchy.

20:12.440 --> 20:15.320
Because Uncle Phil will eat it right up.

20:15.320 --> 20:19.320
Can I just say, I think in the mashed potatoes, though, if you're going to go with the food

20:19.320 --> 20:21.080
one, mashed potatoes is the best.

20:21.080 --> 20:22.640
Yeah, it's really the sexiest, definitely.

20:22.640 --> 20:23.640
It's easy to hide.

20:23.640 --> 20:25.080
Hide it in a pile of green beans.

20:25.080 --> 20:27.320
Okay, Josh writes to us from Gmail.

20:27.320 --> 20:30.960
He says, I'm getting married this October and of all the things I'm worried about,

20:30.960 --> 20:33.880
the main worry I have is dancing.

20:33.880 --> 20:35.720
The first dance, he means.

20:35.720 --> 20:38.880
Saying I have two left feet is putting it nicely.

20:38.880 --> 20:42.480
I'm more of a quadriplegic with one left foot and one club foot.

20:42.480 --> 20:43.480
That's kind of mean.

20:43.480 --> 20:44.480
It is a little mean.

20:44.480 --> 20:46.320
It's Daniel Day Lewis getting married.

20:46.320 --> 20:49.200
What does being a robot have to do with it?

20:49.200 --> 20:54.440
My fiance has made many mentions of how we're probably going to go to the old high school

20:54.440 --> 20:58.400
dance route where we just hold each other and spin in a circle slowly.

20:58.400 --> 21:02.120
I can tell by her less than enthusiastic tone, this will not make her happy.

21:02.120 --> 21:05.680
I am too poor to afford dance lessons, thanks to the wedding.

21:05.680 --> 21:10.680
And I'm wondering if MB and BAM has any tips or advice on what I should do.

21:10.680 --> 21:11.680
Oh, Jesus.

21:11.680 --> 21:12.680
Josh.

21:12.680 --> 21:13.680
Oh, dance tips.

21:13.680 --> 21:14.680
Perfect, Josh.

21:14.680 --> 21:15.680
Hold on.

21:15.680 --> 21:16.680
Here we go.

21:16.680 --> 21:17.680
Sway.

21:17.680 --> 21:21.160
Let me give you, I'm going to give you a five word answer right here.

21:21.160 --> 21:23.520
Watch Save the Last Dance.

21:23.520 --> 21:24.520
Yeah.

21:24.520 --> 21:25.880
Step up 3D.

21:25.880 --> 21:29.320
That's the cheapest dance classes you can get because at the end you don't just learn

21:29.320 --> 21:30.320
the moves.

21:30.320 --> 21:31.320
You learn about the passion.

21:31.320 --> 21:33.320
And that's the important thing.

21:33.320 --> 21:35.440
Justin, what did you, you're married.

21:35.440 --> 21:36.440
Yeah.

21:36.440 --> 21:37.440
What did you do?

21:37.440 --> 21:39.120
I, I'm a grownup.

21:39.120 --> 21:45.000
So I held my wife's waist and she held my shoulders and we spun in a circle.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.200
Like that, guys, that's not boring.

21:47.200 --> 21:53.680
That's like what people do because I cannot, like seriously, if, if you guys choreograph

21:53.680 --> 21:59.560
a swing routine, the douche chills will hit me from hundreds of miles and I'm like, oh,

21:59.560 --> 22:01.120
what did they just do?

22:01.120 --> 22:03.320
I just got a douche.

22:03.320 --> 22:05.160
I think you should freak dancer.

22:05.160 --> 22:06.160
Yeah.

22:06.160 --> 22:12.400
Crunk that shit in front of God and everyone really start crumping and like just go to

22:12.400 --> 22:13.400
town on it.

22:13.400 --> 22:14.400
Just cramp it.

22:14.400 --> 22:16.800
Just cramp across the dance floor.

22:16.800 --> 22:17.800
That's the thing, right?

22:17.800 --> 22:20.960
Cramping and don't let her know you're going to do that.

22:20.960 --> 22:25.840
Start really sweet and like swaying and like in a circle and then just go to town.

22:25.840 --> 22:26.840
Someone help me.

22:26.840 --> 22:28.800
My new husband is having a seizure.

22:28.800 --> 22:29.800
Help.

22:29.800 --> 22:36.080
So many people, so many people do first dances at their wedding receptions.

22:36.080 --> 22:40.960
Like there's gotta be other things that you can do to symbolize like you and I are, are

22:40.960 --> 22:42.440
together for revs.

22:42.440 --> 22:43.440
Right?

22:43.440 --> 22:44.440
Right.

22:44.440 --> 22:45.440
First arm wrestling.

22:45.440 --> 22:46.760
First, first staring contest is what I was thinking of.

22:46.760 --> 22:48.180
Like put on a slow song, whatever.

22:48.180 --> 22:51.640
Just go on the dance floor, don't touch and just have a staring contest.

22:51.640 --> 22:52.640
Yeah.

22:52.640 --> 22:53.640
First knife fight.

22:53.640 --> 22:55.560
Well, that might be a little grizzly.

22:55.560 --> 23:01.640
Can I tell you it seriously on the day when you are married, there's, there's so much

23:01.640 --> 23:07.600
else going on and so many people there that care about you and, and, and things like that.

23:07.600 --> 23:12.000
You will not worry about your dance.

23:12.000 --> 23:15.440
I promise you it will be like so low on your, on your priority list.

23:15.440 --> 23:16.680
It's going to be fine.

23:16.680 --> 23:23.000
And I, and, and it, if you're worried about your wife being bored by your first dance,

23:23.000 --> 23:25.080
there's going to be so much else.

23:25.080 --> 23:26.080
Yeah.

23:26.080 --> 23:27.600
There's going to be so much else going on that day.

23:27.600 --> 23:29.360
Well, I thought you were going a different way with that.

23:29.360 --> 23:30.360
Wow.

23:30.360 --> 23:31.360
Yeah.

23:31.360 --> 23:34.600
You are so many more problems that are just going to branch off of that one.

23:34.600 --> 23:36.200
You guys should probably talk about it.

23:36.200 --> 23:37.200
Yeah.

23:37.200 --> 23:39.960
Ask, uh, and last ask Josh how he did it.

23:39.960 --> 23:40.960
See we're making connections.

23:40.960 --> 23:45.400
Hey, as long as we're going on this romantic streak, I would like to posit one from Yahoo

23:45.400 --> 23:46.400
answers.

23:46.400 --> 23:47.400
Yeah.

23:47.400 --> 23:48.400
Okay.

23:48.400 --> 23:55.160
Um, this one comes to us from blue devil ATV racer.

23:55.160 --> 23:56.720
I'm so glad I worked that one out.

23:56.720 --> 24:01.360
Um, blue devil ATV racer like that have, I think he's got it all figured out.

24:01.360 --> 24:04.520
Uh, this question was also sent in by Mike Susek.

24:04.520 --> 24:05.520
Thank you.

24:05.520 --> 24:06.520
Mike Susek.

24:06.520 --> 24:12.920
Um, blue devil ATV racer asks, how do I get my girlfriend to start to rub my crotch while

24:12.920 --> 24:16.240
we make out?

24:16.240 --> 24:21.640
I just don't know how to get her to, we've been making out since forever and I get excited,

24:21.640 --> 24:24.500
but my crotch just needs some attention.

24:24.500 --> 24:26.680
How do I go about this?

24:26.680 --> 24:28.720
Oh, blue devil.

24:28.720 --> 24:29.720
It's so easy.

24:29.720 --> 24:33.360
Um, you just put a little peanut butter down there.

24:33.360 --> 24:43.360
Oh, well, what you don't want to do is hide it in mashed potatoes.

24:43.360 --> 24:45.600
That's absolutely the worst thing you can do.

24:45.600 --> 24:49.040
I like how nonspecific he is.

24:49.040 --> 24:57.520
I don't care if she rubs my penis in that quadrant and you just want her to start to

24:57.520 --> 24:58.520
do it.

24:58.520 --> 24:59.520
Yeah.

24:59.520 --> 25:00.520
Just start from there.

25:00.520 --> 25:01.520
She'll know what to do.

25:01.520 --> 25:02.520
Where the hair starts.

25:02.520 --> 25:09.400
Did you tell her it's sore and ask if she has any icy hot?

25:09.400 --> 25:10.400
Yeah.

25:10.400 --> 25:11.640
Can you rub that down for me?

25:11.640 --> 25:12.920
It's getting a little stiff.

25:12.920 --> 25:13.920
What?

25:13.920 --> 25:24.840
I'm going to use my crotch just needs some attention.

25:24.840 --> 25:32.440
That sounds like something a serial killer says.

25:32.440 --> 25:35.520
What dialogue is going on between you and your crotch?

25:35.520 --> 25:38.200
Hey, I'm down here too.

25:38.200 --> 25:39.200
Come on.

25:39.200 --> 25:45.160
Um, I didn't want to say anything, but I could use a little attention down here.

25:45.160 --> 25:46.800
I'm feeling real snubbed down here.

25:46.800 --> 25:49.720
You and I used to be so close.

25:49.720 --> 25:50.720
I miss Debra.

25:50.720 --> 25:51.720
Remember Debra?

25:51.720 --> 25:53.360
You remember Debra?

25:53.360 --> 25:57.000
She used to rub, start to rub me frequently.

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
So frequently.

25:58.000 --> 26:01.440
And you wouldn't even have to tell her that there was peanut butter down there.

26:01.440 --> 26:02.440
She would just know.

26:02.440 --> 26:03.440
Holy shit.

26:03.440 --> 26:04.440
What?

26:04.440 --> 26:05.440
God, people.

26:05.440 --> 26:06.440
What?

26:06.440 --> 26:14.880
I don't understand these people who would ask this on Yahoo instead of just saying like,

26:14.880 --> 26:18.120
hey, rub my balls.

26:18.120 --> 26:19.120
It's important.

26:19.120 --> 26:20.120
I love you.

26:20.120 --> 26:21.120
I need some attention.

26:21.120 --> 26:23.560
Some attention in my downtown.

26:23.560 --> 26:25.560
Take me downtown to attention town.

26:25.560 --> 26:27.760
You know what's up?

26:27.760 --> 26:28.760
Dear Bim Bammers.

26:28.760 --> 26:30.400
I have a friend that once.

26:30.400 --> 26:31.400
We're simpatico.

26:31.400 --> 26:32.960
Can we just take a moment?

26:32.960 --> 26:35.360
We need the exact moment to move on.

26:35.360 --> 26:36.680
I'll be over here.

26:36.680 --> 26:38.800
Hey, Bim Bammers.

26:38.800 --> 26:39.800
We'll do every other word.

26:39.800 --> 26:40.800
Okay.

26:40.800 --> 26:41.800
Okay.

26:41.800 --> 26:42.800
I have.

26:42.800 --> 26:43.800
I'm not doing this.

26:43.800 --> 26:47.760
A friend that wants advice about her relationship, which seems to have become toxic.

26:47.760 --> 26:49.020
I don't know the guy.

26:49.020 --> 26:52.680
So can I really tell her to break up with him even though I've never met him?

26:52.680 --> 26:54.240
Would that be overstepping my boundaries?

26:54.240 --> 26:57.360
Bitch, what do you think we do every week?

26:57.360 --> 26:58.360
What?

26:58.360 --> 27:04.520
Do you remember the guy who was like, my friend is trapped in town and I need him to get him

27:04.520 --> 27:05.520
to move away?

27:05.520 --> 27:06.520
That one?

27:06.520 --> 27:07.520
Yeah.

27:07.520 --> 27:10.920
This is like the same basic principle of, yeah, you can totally tell her to break up

27:10.920 --> 27:11.920
with him.

27:11.920 --> 27:12.920
But be prepared.

27:12.920 --> 27:13.920
Yeah.

27:13.920 --> 27:14.920
Right.

27:14.920 --> 27:15.920
You can tell anybody anything.

27:15.920 --> 27:19.600
Just this week, just this episode, we've told people to fake their death to really

27:19.600 --> 27:22.720
die and put peanut butter on their genitalia.

27:22.720 --> 27:23.720
Yeah.

27:23.720 --> 27:28.960
So, yeah, I don't think boundaries are a big issue for us.

27:28.960 --> 27:33.200
But we also don't have to see any of you every day, so that's an added bonus for us.

27:33.200 --> 27:37.120
This is the only thing I can tell you about advice like that.

27:37.120 --> 27:38.920
Their relationship has become toxic.

27:38.920 --> 27:39.920
Okay.

27:39.920 --> 27:41.280
That's bad.

27:41.280 --> 27:47.100
But I would say for 99% of advice, people don't want it.

27:47.100 --> 27:51.880
What they want is someone to support what they already believe.

27:51.880 --> 27:54.480
I really do think that.

27:54.480 --> 28:00.760
Especially if she's not seeking out advice from you like, oh, I don't know what to do.

28:00.760 --> 28:06.640
She doesn't want you to tell her that unless she's looking for it specifically.

28:06.640 --> 28:14.160
And excluding everything that we say every episode, as a friend, your job is to give

28:14.160 --> 28:18.560
her the advice she wants and not the advice you think she needs.

28:18.560 --> 28:19.560
That's not how that works.

28:19.560 --> 28:20.560
That's interesting.

28:20.560 --> 28:21.560
Yeah.

28:21.560 --> 28:24.760
That's a good, you know, supporting her opinions is more important.

28:24.760 --> 28:33.200
If it's like, if you believe in your heart that it's bad, you should tell her that.

28:33.200 --> 28:35.560
You should tell her that you think it's bad.

28:35.560 --> 28:41.200
But people have to go in those realizations on their own, especially in bad relationships.

28:41.200 --> 28:42.520
People have got to realize it.

28:42.520 --> 28:46.400
I really think you've got to meet the guy first, though, before you can, because maybe

28:46.400 --> 28:47.880
things aren't going toxic.

28:47.880 --> 28:50.000
Maybe things are getting a little bit stale.

28:50.000 --> 28:53.840
Maybe he's a super nice guy and there's something else that's wrong in the relationship.

28:53.840 --> 28:57.280
I just think it's kind of a blunt way to handle the problem.

28:57.280 --> 28:58.280
You should, you should.

28:58.280 --> 29:01.160
And how serious can this relationship be if you haven't met the dude?

29:01.160 --> 29:02.160
Yeah.

29:02.160 --> 29:04.920
If you want to be my lover, you got to get with my friends.

29:04.920 --> 29:09.480
And it seems like she completely over, like, just skip that step.

29:09.480 --> 29:13.640
Stop right now, thank you very much.

29:13.640 --> 29:14.640
Whoa.

29:14.640 --> 29:15.640
You think he's radioactive?

29:15.640 --> 29:16.640
Yeah.

29:16.640 --> 29:17.640
Oh shit.

29:17.640 --> 29:18.640
That's why she hasn't met him.

29:18.640 --> 29:20.120
He's being kept in a lead box.

29:20.120 --> 29:22.960
This is my boyfriend, lead box.

29:22.960 --> 29:24.360
I've never seen his face.

29:24.360 --> 29:25.720
I can't hear him talk.

29:25.720 --> 29:30.140
This lady's friend is dating the toxic Avenger.

29:30.140 --> 29:32.720
It's got a little toxic.

29:32.720 --> 29:36.560
What you need to do is stay with that, because that franchise is coming back around.

29:36.560 --> 29:39.220
Oh man, that garbage pail kids.

29:39.220 --> 29:40.400
It's a new day.

29:40.400 --> 29:45.720
Here's a quickie from FormSpring, a quickie from us, because it's going to be a quick

29:45.720 --> 29:46.720
answer.

29:46.720 --> 29:47.720
Yeah.

29:47.720 --> 29:51.680
Dear bambinos, or dear bambinos, can you really have friends that are girls?

29:51.680 --> 29:54.860
After a while, I get really close to them and start seeing the possibility of more than

29:54.860 --> 29:56.280
friends relationship.

29:56.280 --> 29:59.000
What do?

29:59.000 --> 30:00.960
You're a terrible person.

30:00.960 --> 30:02.640
Ew.

30:02.640 --> 30:05.640
I'm not exactly sure what you're asking.

30:05.640 --> 30:10.120
I think he's saying that he tries to be friends with girls and then he falls in love with

30:10.120 --> 30:11.120
them.

30:11.120 --> 30:12.120
Is that right?

30:12.120 --> 30:13.120
Sure.

30:13.120 --> 30:14.120
Yeah.

30:14.120 --> 30:15.120
Hey, that's called biology, man.

30:15.120 --> 30:16.180
Like, seriously.

30:16.180 --> 30:17.180
That's how we're built.

30:17.180 --> 30:18.680
We're built to want to propagate this species.

30:18.680 --> 30:21.240
No, some people are built like that.

30:21.240 --> 30:22.920
I totally see where this dude's coming from.

30:22.920 --> 30:27.240
Some people are built like that, and it really is something that you mature out of.

30:27.240 --> 30:29.160
Yeah, that is true, though.

30:29.160 --> 30:35.160
I think that you can have more mature, cross-gender relationships as you get older.

30:35.160 --> 30:37.360
And as you have more legit relationships.

30:37.360 --> 30:38.360
Yeah.

30:38.360 --> 30:43.520
And as you understand, like right now, you don't understand how that relationship works.

30:43.520 --> 30:48.960
So you're starting to feel these nice, warm, fuzzy feelings, which is the friendship, and

30:48.960 --> 30:54.080
then looking at a girl that you find attractive and combining those two things.

30:54.080 --> 30:57.720
You have to be able to keep those two things separate to maintain the friendship.

30:57.720 --> 31:01.360
Friendship is a good basis for a relationship, but the problem is, if you've been friends

31:01.360 --> 31:07.480
for a long time, you kind of miss out on that flirting stage where you're getting to know

31:07.480 --> 31:08.480
each other.

31:08.480 --> 31:11.680
And that can be one of those exciting time relationships.

31:11.680 --> 31:14.080
And you're in kind of a weird spot.

31:14.080 --> 31:21.140
You're like ahead of and behind the game simultaneously when you start off as friends.

31:21.140 --> 31:24.120
But that is normal.

31:24.120 --> 31:25.120
Let's say that.

31:25.120 --> 31:26.120
And you can't have friends.

31:26.120 --> 31:28.360
You just got to be a little older.

31:28.360 --> 31:33.880
And it's easier if you have a girlfriend already to have friends that are girls, but she will

31:33.880 --> 31:34.880
hate them.

31:34.880 --> 31:35.880
That's even easier.

31:35.880 --> 31:36.880
Or if they're uggos.

31:36.880 --> 31:37.880
If they're uggos.

31:37.880 --> 31:38.880
Yeah.

31:38.880 --> 31:40.720
Hey, that's your answer.

31:40.720 --> 31:42.600
Yes, if they're uggos.

31:42.600 --> 31:47.600
And that's, hey ladies, that goes both ways, okay?

31:47.600 --> 31:52.520
And also, if they go both ways, you can be great friends with them.

31:52.520 --> 31:55.760
I'm leaving for my sophomore year at college in a couple of weeks, so there's going to

31:55.760 --> 31:57.880
be the inevitable teary goodbye soon.

31:57.880 --> 32:02.200
Would it be weird if, when that final goodbye hug, I pecked one of my female friends on

32:02.200 --> 32:03.200
the cheek?

32:03.200 --> 32:04.960
We're extremely close.

32:04.960 --> 32:06.440
She's blown kisses at me before.

32:06.440 --> 32:09.080
I see it as a way to express our affection for each other.

32:09.080 --> 32:13.680
I just don't want to pull away from that post-peck hug and suddenly be weird between us.

32:13.680 --> 32:14.680
Any help would be appreciated.

32:14.680 --> 32:15.680
God damn it, Brad.

32:15.680 --> 32:16.680
Damn it, Brad.

32:16.680 --> 32:17.680
I'm so creeped out.

32:17.680 --> 32:18.680
Did you not hear what we just said?

32:18.680 --> 32:20.720
What we just said.

32:20.720 --> 32:22.120
It's like you're not even listening.

32:22.120 --> 32:25.040
How could you ask that?

32:25.040 --> 32:26.760
I'm so creeped out right now.

32:26.760 --> 32:27.760
Why would you-

32:27.760 --> 32:28.760
No, don't be creeped out.

32:28.760 --> 32:29.760
That's a natural.

32:29.760 --> 32:31.840
It's because he uses the word pecked.

32:31.840 --> 32:40.240
Brad, I think if that's in your heart, there is nothing wrong with affection.

32:40.240 --> 32:43.400
No one's ever going to think that's weird.

32:43.400 --> 32:48.480
You know, in France, you legally have to kiss someone on the lips four times when you meet

32:48.480 --> 32:50.600
a new person.

32:50.600 --> 32:51.600
Did you know that, Brad?

32:51.600 --> 32:54.960
There's a lot of herpes going around in France.

32:54.960 --> 32:56.160
Just give her a kiss.

32:56.160 --> 32:57.160
You know what?

32:57.160 --> 33:03.000
I think if you're moving away, I think you should kiss her full on the lips and then

33:03.000 --> 33:08.160
put some peanut butter on your crotch and just see where it goes, you know?

33:08.160 --> 33:10.400
Brad, let me counterpoint here.

33:10.400 --> 33:11.400
Okay.

33:11.400 --> 33:12.400
That's weird.

33:12.400 --> 33:13.400
Don't do that.

33:13.400 --> 33:14.400
Don't do that.

33:14.400 --> 33:17.520
Because you will pull away and even if it's not weird, it will be weird because you will

33:17.520 --> 33:20.080
pull away and be thinking, was that weird?

33:20.080 --> 33:21.340
Yes, it is.

33:21.340 --> 33:23.240
Because you know who pecks people on the cheek?

33:23.240 --> 33:24.240
Old people.

33:24.240 --> 33:25.240
Are you old people?

33:25.240 --> 33:26.400
Are you not old people?

33:26.400 --> 33:28.680
Are you over four feet tall because you ain't that old?

33:28.680 --> 33:29.680
Do you know what?

33:29.680 --> 33:33.680
I'm going to start giving people kisses on the cheek.

33:33.680 --> 33:35.280
That's going to be my new jam.

33:35.280 --> 33:36.840
Like Justin, you hug people all the time.

33:36.840 --> 33:40.920
I'm going to start like when I meet people at like a convention or something, they're

33:40.920 --> 33:42.560
going to get a big smack on the cheek.

33:42.560 --> 33:45.440
That's going to be my calling card because I don't think there's anything wrong with

33:45.440 --> 33:46.440
it.

33:46.440 --> 33:48.240
I think it's a sweet display of affection.

33:48.240 --> 33:49.240
Okay.

33:49.240 --> 33:50.240
Here's what we're going to do.

33:50.240 --> 33:57.440
We're all going to, you and the rest of the MBM nation are going to start hugging and

33:57.440 --> 34:03.840
kissing people, kissing them on the cheek so much that by the time you leave, it's not

34:03.840 --> 34:06.160
going to be weird anymore from like an adult point of view.

34:06.160 --> 34:07.160
That's what I'm saying.

34:07.160 --> 34:08.160
I'm taking it back.

34:08.160 --> 34:09.920
So we're going to take care of it for him?

34:09.920 --> 34:10.920
We're going to fix it?

34:10.920 --> 34:16.920
When you see us in public, by which I mean Griffin, just kiss him on the cheek and he

34:16.920 --> 34:17.920
will return the favor.

34:17.920 --> 34:18.920
Unless you're a dude.

34:18.920 --> 34:21.640
Just come on.

34:21.640 --> 34:26.440
The important thing to keep in mind is after that kiss on the cheek, no eye contact.

34:26.440 --> 34:27.440
Oh my God.

34:27.440 --> 34:28.440
It's so important.

34:28.440 --> 34:32.800
You've got to, you've got to just get out, look away and go.

34:32.800 --> 34:39.480
And I think remember shoulder slumped, it's, it's open mouth, no tongue for your first

34:39.480 --> 34:46.580
cheek kiss for your first cheek kiss, maybe move up to the ear, maybe give a little nibble.

34:46.580 --> 34:52.080
Maybe just find out, smell her hair or don't do that at all.

34:52.080 --> 34:53.400
Don't do any of that stuff.

34:53.400 --> 34:57.020
There's a hot girl cashiering, is that a word?

34:57.020 --> 35:00.480
There's a hot girl cashiering at my local hypermarket.

35:00.480 --> 35:05.760
I've only seen her once and have not been through her checkout line.

35:05.760 --> 35:10.000
What can I purchase at her register to make a great first impression?

35:10.000 --> 35:13.080
Is there a sequence of items that will make her mine?

35:13.080 --> 35:16.800
This is a great question, people who want great questions.

35:16.800 --> 35:19.040
This is a great question.

35:19.040 --> 35:28.440
Jar of honey, box of condoms, children's movie, fish oil, fish oil, take care of yourself.

35:28.440 --> 35:32.800
I would say walk up and slap down like a bag of kitty litter and stare her directly in

35:32.800 --> 35:40.360
the eyes and say, I don't own a cat here to get extra small condoms and then throw them

35:40.360 --> 35:44.480
on the register and be like, what?

35:44.480 --> 35:45.920
Confidence, ladies like that.

35:45.920 --> 35:47.640
You have these any smaller?

35:47.640 --> 35:55.400
Can I talk to your manager about special ordering smaller condoms than your smallest size?

35:55.400 --> 35:57.800
You got any thimbles?

35:57.800 --> 36:05.080
Do you have any plantains upon which I can test these bad boys out?

36:05.080 --> 36:10.280
Little rubber things you put on your thumb to go through papers, that would be ideal.

36:10.280 --> 36:12.720
I'm more or less dealing with a gumdrop down there.

36:12.720 --> 36:19.560
It's a little safe and fleshy acorn.

36:19.560 --> 36:21.160
I don't think any of these things are going to work.

36:21.160 --> 36:22.680
No, I don't think so either.

36:22.680 --> 36:25.200
Man, this is really bad advice.

36:25.200 --> 36:26.200
It seemed good.

36:26.200 --> 36:32.760
It seemed like it was going so well.

36:32.760 --> 36:33.760
Cosmo?

36:33.760 --> 36:35.280
Would that be cool?

36:35.280 --> 36:36.600
Like you're in the women's needs?

36:36.600 --> 36:39.640
Oh, you know what would be fucking dope?

36:39.640 --> 36:45.440
What if you bought a whole bunch of expensive shit so that whenever the price came up on

36:45.440 --> 36:50.280
the little monitor there, the price was your phone number.

36:50.280 --> 36:58.960
You would have to add it up super specific, but she'd be like, oh, this is 30,000 blah

36:58.960 --> 36:59.960
blah blah.

36:59.960 --> 37:01.640
It would be your phone number, dog.

37:01.640 --> 37:02.920
And you'd be like, oh, that's so weird.

37:02.920 --> 37:03.920
That's my phone number.

37:03.920 --> 37:06.560
You should give me a ring sometime and then walk away without paying for it.

37:06.560 --> 37:08.880
But also I need to return all this stuff.

37:08.880 --> 37:12.640
Good luck re-shelving this shit.

37:12.640 --> 37:16.480
You should say, maybe you can ring me up.

37:16.480 --> 37:17.480
What?

37:17.480 --> 37:19.560
And then she'd be like, oh my God, I'm a cashier.

37:19.560 --> 37:21.440
And you'd be like, yeah, I know.

37:21.440 --> 37:24.400
Have fun putting that stuff back.

37:24.400 --> 37:29.560
Yeah, I think that Griffin's got the best idea.

37:29.560 --> 37:36.520
The only other alternative is to wait until an old, like old, old short, slutty woman

37:36.520 --> 37:37.520
goes through her register.

37:37.520 --> 37:41.800
And then when she's like fumbling for her checkbook or whatever, you just say, oh, don't

37:41.800 --> 37:42.800
worry about it, ma'am.

37:42.800 --> 37:43.800
I've got it.

37:43.800 --> 37:46.880
Thank you for your dedication to this nation.

37:46.880 --> 37:48.680
And I think that would go really well.

37:48.680 --> 37:52.280
You fucked a lot of Marines.

37:52.280 --> 37:53.280
You old slut.

37:53.280 --> 37:54.280
What do you guys think?

37:54.280 --> 37:58.760
Are we ready for the last question or should we do another?

37:58.760 --> 37:59.760
What do you think?

37:59.760 --> 38:00.760
Yeah, let's do one more.

38:00.760 --> 38:01.760
Okay.

38:01.760 --> 38:02.760
Griffin, you pick.

38:02.760 --> 38:03.760
You're good at picking.

38:03.760 --> 38:12.240
Um, let's see, let's, let's see.

38:12.240 --> 38:13.960
Okay.

38:13.960 --> 38:20.800
This is not the kind of flow we would normally look for in a high energy podcast, but we'll

38:20.800 --> 38:23.760
just slow it down until you pick just the right question.

38:23.760 --> 38:24.760
I'm reading.

38:24.760 --> 38:25.880
We got so many good questions this week.

38:25.880 --> 38:28.600
I want to thank everyone for sending us so many good questions.

38:28.600 --> 38:30.720
You really got the hint.

38:30.720 --> 38:36.400
Now let me say we did get fewer creepy questions, but they became exponentially more creepy.

38:36.400 --> 38:40.320
Um, and to those people I say, no, thank you.

38:40.320 --> 38:44.560
Um, we actually got a good, we actually got a good one from a, on Twitter that I want

38:44.560 --> 38:49.200
to address from hit it from Joe Martini is his, is his Twitter username.

38:49.200 --> 38:50.680
I was just laid off on Wednesday.

38:50.680 --> 38:52.400
I'm sorry to hear that, Joe.

38:52.400 --> 38:57.400
And rather than seeking new employment, I decided to chase my dreams.

38:57.400 --> 38:58.960
Good idea or bad.

38:58.960 --> 39:06.000
Well, the important component here is what's, what's your dream jet packs jet pack.

39:06.000 --> 39:12.120
If you're going to pursue the jet pack future and lift society up with you, then yes, that's

39:12.120 --> 39:13.120
good.

39:13.120 --> 39:17.040
Now, if your dream is being homeless, that's bad.

39:17.040 --> 39:18.040
That's the thing.

39:18.040 --> 39:24.360
No one's, no one's dream has ever like the manager of a local bank, which would be a

39:24.360 --> 39:29.100
fungibly secure, you know, um, vocation.

39:29.100 --> 39:34.440
And most people are, you know, I want to be Tom Cruise's best friend.

39:34.440 --> 39:36.400
I want to open a failing bar.

39:36.400 --> 39:37.400
That's my dream.

39:37.400 --> 39:40.520
A real middle of the road kind of establishment.

39:40.520 --> 39:46.520
Uh, I think that pursuing your dreams is always a good idea cause you only go around on those

39:46.520 --> 39:50.800
big blue ball once and it's big, stupid orb.

39:50.800 --> 39:58.560
Listen, shoot for the stars, shoot for the stars.

39:58.560 --> 40:04.200
And even if you miss, you'll run into the moon.

40:04.200 --> 40:05.200
What's up moon?

40:05.200 --> 40:06.200
I failed.

40:06.200 --> 40:07.200
You're a hollow bitch.

40:07.200 --> 40:08.200
I'm 95% sure.

40:08.200 --> 40:09.200
Aim for the sky.

40:09.200 --> 40:10.200
That's how that phrase goes.

40:10.200 --> 40:11.200
Yeah.

40:11.200 --> 40:12.200
Something like that.

40:12.200 --> 40:24.320
So Griffin, I want to hear your last question, but first I'll do a little housekeeping.

40:24.320 --> 40:26.320
Um, thank you guys.

40:26.320 --> 40:28.200
We can't thank you guys enough.

40:28.200 --> 40:29.200
Seriously.

40:29.200 --> 40:32.240
You do not know how incredibly supportive you've been.

40:32.240 --> 40:38.920
Um, we, uh, have gotten so many people spreading the word about the show that that's really

40:38.920 --> 40:49.060
how we, um, how we increase the size of our, uh, influence is by, uh, is by adding new

40:49.060 --> 40:52.980
listeners via word of mouth.

40:52.980 --> 40:57.000
You can always put us on speakers and blast us as you drive through your neighborhood.

40:57.000 --> 40:58.040
That's good.

40:58.040 --> 41:04.920
Tell a friend, tell an enemy, tell a loved one, um, and you'll love them more as a result

41:04.920 --> 41:06.440
because you'll bond.

41:06.440 --> 41:12.880
Um, if you want to ask us a question, if you want to seek out our advice, it's at mbmbam.com

41:12.880 --> 41:23.360
or all the different, um, methods, uh, you can, uh, you can, uh, email us mbmbam at gmail.com.

41:23.360 --> 41:24.360
You can call us.

41:24.360 --> 41:25.360
What's the number?

41:25.360 --> 41:30.240
Uh, it's, oh God, I'll tell you in just one second.

41:30.240 --> 41:31.240
Okay.

41:31.240 --> 41:32.240
Keep talking.

41:32.240 --> 41:33.240
Okay.

41:33.240 --> 41:34.880
Uh, you can hit us on Twitter.

41:34.880 --> 41:38.360
We love to see a two zero three mbmbam one.

41:38.360 --> 41:39.360
Okay.

41:39.360 --> 41:40.360
You can hit us on Twitter.

41:40.360 --> 41:46.480
We like to, we love to see, uh, questions on Twitter and, and quotes, uh, uh, from the

41:46.480 --> 41:49.800
show always make us laugh cause we forget the dumb shit that we say.

41:49.800 --> 41:54.960
Um, and just so everyone knows secretly, I'm keeping count in my head of which, whose

41:54.960 --> 41:56.960
quotes get tweeted more.

41:56.960 --> 41:57.960
Yeah.

41:57.960 --> 41:58.960
How's it going?

41:58.960 --> 42:03.600
Um, you're going to have to check my math on this, but I got a leg up.

42:03.600 --> 42:09.400
I got a leg up last week cause so many people tweeted the, the anorexic balsamic thing.

42:09.400 --> 42:10.400
Yeah.

42:10.400 --> 42:12.040
But that was the funniest question we've ever gotten.

42:12.040 --> 42:14.040
So that was understandable.

42:14.040 --> 42:15.040
Yeah.

42:15.040 --> 42:22.840
Um, so also still on the site that you can buy if you want to, if you want to get active,

42:22.840 --> 42:27.320
like get involved, uh, you can buy a t-shirt.

42:27.320 --> 42:31.120
We have a logo t-shirt and a shirt that says, Hey Jeffrey.

42:31.120 --> 42:35.040
Um, I know the site says pre-order, but they're not pre-orders there.

42:35.040 --> 42:38.440
They're actually on sale now and they have them in stock.

42:38.440 --> 42:41.240
Um, they just started shipping too, didn't they?

42:41.240 --> 42:42.240
Yeah.

42:42.240 --> 42:43.240
They just started shipping.

42:43.240 --> 42:44.900
They should, you should start getting them next week.

42:44.900 --> 42:47.960
They're shipping out in the, in the order they were purchased.

42:47.960 --> 42:52.600
So, uh, if you got on it early, hopefully next week you should be getting one.

42:52.600 --> 42:58.320
Make sure you send us like pictures with you wearing them in, uh, dangerous places or pictures

42:58.320 --> 43:01.280
of you not wearing them.

43:01.280 --> 43:02.280
Yuck.

43:02.280 --> 43:03.280
Gross.

43:03.280 --> 43:04.920
That's, that's weirder than a peck on the cheek.

43:04.920 --> 43:13.360
Um, you, you can also buy in BNB am the app experience, um, which is our, our iPhone app.

43:13.360 --> 43:15.360
Uh, so many people purchased that.

43:15.360 --> 43:19.360
Uh, we just got the numbers in and people, people really support it.

43:19.360 --> 43:26.080
Um, there's a, as of this listening Griffin, is there a new special feature on?

43:26.080 --> 43:27.400
Yeah, I'll put it on there.

43:27.400 --> 43:29.960
Yeah, there's a, there's a new bonus feature on there.

43:29.960 --> 43:35.400
We, we put some little edited clips, uh, up on the app experience so you can purchase

43:35.400 --> 43:37.600
that in the app store if you want even more.

43:37.600 --> 43:39.760
And you can listen to all the episodes and contact us with it and stuff.

43:39.760 --> 43:45.000
I just want to throw out, we've been keeping track of all the justice stats fats entries.

43:45.000 --> 43:46.000
Haven't been many.

43:46.000 --> 43:47.000
At least I have.

43:47.000 --> 43:50.760
There haven't been many, but the ones we've gotten, I mean, pretty, pretty impressive.

43:50.760 --> 43:55.760
Well one was an obvious lie because if you weighed that much, you'd be, you'd be so totally

43:55.760 --> 43:56.760
dead.

43:56.760 --> 43:58.280
You would sink into the hollow earth.

43:58.280 --> 44:03.360
And one person sent in a picture, which I explicitly told them not to do.

44:03.360 --> 44:07.240
I explicitly said no pics.

44:07.240 --> 44:13.800
So you want them to prove it, just not with a picture, just send an MP3 of yourself running

44:13.800 --> 44:17.680
up a flight of stairs.

44:17.680 --> 44:22.560
We're trying to find our fattest listener and reward them with a $2 voucher for our

44:22.560 --> 44:23.840
iPhone app.

44:23.840 --> 44:27.400
I don't know, I don't remember why anymore.

44:27.400 --> 44:30.440
If that helps, that'd be more palatable.

44:30.440 --> 44:33.400
So that's all the housekeeping stuff we have to do.

44:33.400 --> 44:35.880
The main thing is just thank you guys so much.

44:35.880 --> 44:37.640
You have no idea how much it means to us.

44:37.640 --> 44:38.640
Oh, thank you.

44:38.640 --> 44:42.700
Thank you to Bob Ball who recorded our, our disclaimer, which we're going to start putting

44:42.700 --> 44:50.320
before episodes so that we don't get sued by people who, you know, who do put peanut

44:50.320 --> 44:52.360
butter on their, on their wieners.

44:52.360 --> 44:54.040
And then like, I stand by that though.

44:54.040 --> 44:59.360
I do think that that you should follow that advice and also let us know how, if you followed

44:59.360 --> 45:03.280
our advice, which you shouldn't ever do, let us know how that went.

45:03.280 --> 45:04.280
Griffin.

45:04.280 --> 45:05.960
This one's going to be tricky.

45:05.960 --> 45:15.840
Yahoo Answers user Ashley asks, where can I watch the animated version of boku wa imautao

45:15.840 --> 45:18.340
ni koi usuru?

45:18.340 --> 45:31.520
I'm in love with my younger sister, I'm Travis McElroy, I'm Griffin McElroy, and this has

45:31.520 --> 45:32.520
been my brother.

45:32.520 --> 45:33.520
My brother and me.

45:33.520 --> 45:34.520
Kiss your dad.

45:34.520 --> 45:35.520
Square on the lips.

45:35.520 --> 45:54.520
You will never know me.

45:54.520 --> 46:09.120
I'm Travis McElroy, and this has been my brother.
