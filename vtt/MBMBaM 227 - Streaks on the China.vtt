00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:48.240
Hello everybody, welcome, my brother, my brother, me, and advice show and cereal roundup,

00:48.240 --> 00:51.840
Wrap Gap for the modern era. I'm your little brother Justin McElroy.

00:51.840 --> 00:54.080
I'm your middle-aged brother Travis McElroy.

00:54.080 --> 00:58.400
I'm your babiest baby brother Griffin McElroy. Let's get to the wrap gap.

00:58.400 --> 01:02.400
Yep, it's that. No, it's a wrap cap. It's like a wrap up and a recap.

01:02.400 --> 01:05.520
Okay, this is your official cereal after show.

01:07.840 --> 01:14.160
So where we look at the latest episode of true crime special cereal and we discuss where the

01:14.160 --> 01:18.960
clues are leading us. I have to say I think it's pretty obvious at this point.

01:19.840 --> 01:23.760
What do you think Travis? What are your suspicions based on the recent revelations

01:23.760 --> 01:29.840
that the the Best Buy was a front this whole time? Well, I'm gonna say two words Justin,

01:30.480 --> 01:37.680
fugue state. Fugue state. I think the reporter entered into a few state and did it and now

01:37.680 --> 01:43.120
like 15 years later is like reporting on the crime. Huge twist Shyamalan.

01:43.120 --> 01:48.480
I will say that is a fucking awesome cover-up is like I'm gonna get to the bottom of this,

01:48.480 --> 01:52.320
but I'm having trouble getting to the bottom of it. Are you having trouble getting to the

01:52.320 --> 01:57.280
bottom of it or are you the bottom? Well, she doesn't know because it was a fugue state. That's

01:57.280 --> 02:01.760
the twist. It's like she's gonna like find out and be like oh my god it's all pointing to me.

02:01.760 --> 02:07.120
If she wasn't forgetting what happened every day whenever she fell asleep, it would be so much

02:07.120 --> 02:10.800
easier for her to catch the criminal. Series finale is just gonna be her like

02:12.400 --> 02:18.400
all of this discussion of trying to remember where these teens were makes me try, makes me

02:18.400 --> 02:22.720
want to try and think where I was. Let me think oh my god I can't believe oh my god I'm covered

02:22.720 --> 02:28.960
in blood still. Probably the craziest thing about Serial to Me, a podcast that I listen to,

02:29.600 --> 02:35.920
is where is this lady finding all these teens? Yeah. She seems to know where a lot of teens hang

02:35.920 --> 02:40.320
out and I swear to god I haven't seen a teenager in three years. And if you did, how the fuck would

02:40.320 --> 02:43.920
you approach them without scaring them away like some sort of- I want to talk to you about a Best

02:43.920 --> 02:50.000
Buy parking lot. No! I don't get teens to talk to you. The craziest thing about this show,

02:50.560 --> 02:54.960
as long as we're talking about Serial, is that the events in it happened 15 years ago.

02:55.680 --> 03:00.880
And there are people on this show that talk about what happened at a certain time. I have four

03:01.440 --> 03:08.960
pictures in my entire mind's eye from my entire freshman year of high school 15 years ago. And

03:08.960 --> 03:14.880
one of them is me sitting in sweatpants listening to DC Talk on a portable CD player in the band

03:14.880 --> 03:19.600
instrument closet. And in your head it's just subtitled Coolest Day Ever. Justin where were

03:19.600 --> 03:25.440
you? Where were you on February 20th 1995? I can tell you exactly where I was motherfucker. Check

03:25.440 --> 03:31.520
the DC Talk. Check my DC Talk? Let me get- let me open up my dismount and you check the memory.

03:31.520 --> 03:37.040
But then you see I was listening to Jesus Freak on that exact day. Then he opened up the Walkman

03:37.040 --> 03:47.360
and there was no DC Talk. It was Newsboys. Murder solved. Fugue State. I think that I

03:48.160 --> 03:53.120
have only listened to half of an episode but I'm starting to think that maybe this is fiction.

03:53.120 --> 03:57.440
This is a work of fiction. And I know that you can google it and like find the news reports

03:58.320 --> 04:02.080
saying that this this girl was actually murdered. It's an ARG. They play with those. But maybe it's

04:02.080 --> 04:10.560
a fucking ARG and maybe I think that somebody is using this to sell us all Pringles. I think it's

04:10.560 --> 04:15.840
a Pringles ARG. That does explain why they keep talking about Pringles at the scene of the crime.

04:15.840 --> 04:20.400
Exactly. Jay is like I- he called me up and he was like I'm gonna murder her today.

04:22.320 --> 04:26.240
Sir I'm gonna have to- I gotta ask you to stop eating those Pringles while we're taking your

04:26.240 --> 04:31.920
testimony. I'm sorry now that I popped I just can't stop. I just cannot stop. The most frustrating

04:31.920 --> 04:37.600
like experience of serial listening must be for the guy who used to run Circuit City. Because

04:37.600 --> 04:43.760
every episode is an extended commercial for Best Buy. Like they don't need the exposure. I bet that

04:43.760 --> 04:48.560
guy is wishing on every star he can find that someone would get murdered in the parking lot

04:48.560 --> 04:54.400
of a Circuit City 15 years ago because he needs that heat. Yeah. Yeah. Do you know what I think

04:54.400 --> 04:59.360
the most confusing thing about serial is? What's that, Travis? I've listened to nine episodes and

04:59.360 --> 05:05.120
they have yet to mention Cinnamon Toast Crunch. Okay come on. Low hanging fruit is the sweetest

05:05.120 --> 05:11.280
of fruits. I think we're like we're more than 200 episodes into this thing I think that we can hold

05:11.280 --> 05:16.000
ourselves to a higher standard than that. Okay but I will say- French Toast Crunch. In Travis's

05:16.000 --> 05:21.360
defense I have had at least three experiences in the past couple weeks since Sydney and I started

05:21.360 --> 05:26.240
listening to serial where she will say to me I read the craziest thing about serial today and

05:26.240 --> 05:32.480
I'll perk up like oh that is a that is a favorite topic oh mine did they bring back they brought

05:32.480 --> 05:39.040
back oops all berries it's called ah fuck all berries I might have killed the girl all berries

05:39.040 --> 05:46.640
ah shit all berries odd dunk where were you when all these berries happened what if it what if it

05:46.640 --> 05:52.480
ties back to that Jay is like yeah I totally remember he was eating a bowl of oops all berries

05:52.480 --> 05:58.560
nope sorry oops all berries is out of circulation then check the calendar it is it was not being

05:58.560 --> 06:04.240
made then oh I'm sorry he was eating a McRib no he wasn't no it was not he was not eating a McRib

06:04.240 --> 06:10.320
he was listening to DC talk was he or was it Switchfoot ah shit all berries let's do a question

06:10.960 --> 06:16.240
yeah that sounds good by the way sorry can I apologize to everybody that this is what I sound

06:16.240 --> 06:24.480
like it you can hear you can hear my slimy vocal cords just slapping together forming each consonant

06:24.480 --> 06:29.680
and vowel and I apologize like a drunk seal we had to alter Griffin's voice because he doesn't

06:29.680 --> 06:36.080
want to be identified I don't want to be identified I'm actually the guy from the serial show I need

06:36.080 --> 06:40.640
to listen to more of it my wife won a car a while back and firmly believed it had something to do

06:40.640 --> 06:45.760
with a lucky crystal she bought I'm quit ever since then there has been an increasing number

06:45.760 --> 06:57.920
of crystals appearing around the house am I good god damn you ah fuck you can't make me laugh like

06:57.920 --> 07:02.400
that when I got the the consumption you actually sound better I feel like the crystals healed you

07:02.400 --> 07:10.720
oh fuck thank you oh it was the topaz mmm it was the lustrous topaz on an episode of uh

07:10.720 --> 07:15.840
Penn and Teller's bullshit they say this phrase like everybody's got a gree-gree or something

07:15.840 --> 07:20.160
along those lines so like everybody's got a thing that like they cling to it's like they're special

07:20.160 --> 07:25.120
like and I feel like this is a case of that I think if everybody were to look deep within

07:25.120 --> 07:29.440
themselves everybody has a thing where they were like oh yeah when this really good thing happened

07:29.440 --> 07:33.600
I was wearing this t-shirt so like this is my lucky t-shirt and they always kind of say it like

07:33.600 --> 07:38.000
jokingly like I'm using a tone of voice that shows that I don't really think this is serious

07:38.000 --> 07:43.680
but I said it 20 times today it's so serious but here's the thing can I tell you two something

07:44.720 --> 07:52.240
I've never fucked with crystals and I've never won a car yep Justin gave me his Oldsmobile Cutlass

07:52.240 --> 07:59.600
Sierra um when he upgraded and I guess that was free and you are and to be fair you were on

07:59.600 --> 08:06.960
crystal meth at the time okay I was on that lucky crystal meth I was on that sweet crunch um that

08:06.960 --> 08:12.800
oops all berries and I did get a free car so I take it back crystals are legit they resonate

08:12.800 --> 08:19.680
at a frequency that human beings can't understand but the Silurians can I think that if someone says

08:19.680 --> 08:24.560
they have a lucky crystal you should tell them they have to eat it because think about it if

08:24.560 --> 08:31.520
it's so lucky that should go fine if it's so lucky you should want it inside of you powering your

08:31.520 --> 08:38.800
body yeah like uh like that that like krang in that weird exoskeleton you should want this stone

08:38.800 --> 08:45.600
this crystal inside of you if it's so lucky so eat it already you should start fighting crime

08:45.600 --> 08:50.640
or something it's like I have a crystal that protects me from all harm like cool you need

08:50.640 --> 08:55.760
to leave here or we're going to shoot you to death yeah go ahead and try check out my amethyst

08:55.760 --> 09:02.480
motherfucker I want a car with this shit I want a car with this and it also makes me unkillable

09:02.480 --> 09:06.720
I might be leaving the conclusions I might be leaving the conclusions here but just try and

09:06.720 --> 09:13.440
shoot me through the topaz you cannot sir this story is distinctly American it we find one

09:13.440 --> 09:19.120
crystal that has the magic power to give us cars and we what do we do are we thrilled that we found

09:19.120 --> 09:25.040
them no no we start trying to scam crystals from every which way we can exactly you did you exhaust

09:25.040 --> 09:30.160
the charge on that like why don't you just roll with the one lucky crystal that you found it sounds

09:30.160 --> 09:34.400
like the reporter from serial could use a magic topaz and somebody would hand it to her and she'd

09:34.400 --> 09:38.960
be like oh it was Jay oh god of course the whole time it was right in front of me it was Jay the

09:38.960 --> 09:44.800
whole time I am so sorry I just wasted everybody's time for for for a dozen hours trying to figure

09:44.800 --> 09:48.720
this thing out I could have just touched this topaz and the answer would have revealed itself

09:48.720 --> 09:53.360
to me do you think maybe it's like a ring of keys where this is her lucky car crystal and then she's

09:53.360 --> 09:58.720
got like a lucky job crystal and she's got like a lucky like the food order I made came back

09:58.720 --> 10:03.200
perfect crystal do you think she has a crystal that helps her find sweet crystals oh this is

10:03.200 --> 10:11.200
my crystal crystal crystal yeah this is my crystal gale crystal that I'll crystal gale vinyl I think

10:11.200 --> 10:16.880
that if this is her thing if this is like your wife's thing there there is a saturation point

10:16.880 --> 10:21.520
where I think you get to say like honey the crystals they're everywhere we don't have money

10:21.520 --> 10:26.400
for food because you bought crystals but I think I think that that line is the first time you step

10:26.400 --> 10:32.080
on one yeah like the first time well not so lucky it seems it seems this one might be busted

10:32.080 --> 10:36.880
check the energy on it somebody call a ghostbuster the energons in this one aren't quite matching up

10:36.880 --> 10:44.320
maybe we go a different way do you want to yahoo yeah hit me this yahoo was sent in by sarah benson

10:44.320 --> 10:50.720
thank you sarah you send in a lot of great yahoo's this week sarah so the I feel like we should have

10:50.720 --> 10:54.880
a new segment on the show called game recognized game where people just like crush it with yahoo's

10:55.600 --> 11:01.440
um game recognized game sarah benson great job it's asked by yahoo answers user whoa fuck

11:02.400 --> 11:09.760
before I and then there's a check mark and then you are you and then it's slash and then 18

11:11.120 --> 11:18.000
that probably means some sort of sex thing before I check you this random string of gobbledygook

11:18.000 --> 11:29.520
asks before I check you are you slash before I check you are you 18 that's what it is all right

11:29.520 --> 11:36.720
gross cool history you must have a back cool backstory that you have contained in a single

11:36.720 --> 11:44.960
username this horrible goblin asks in the truman show do they film him when he's in the shower

11:44.960 --> 11:51.680
in the toilet or making love topical because they film every second of his life but those

11:51.680 --> 11:55.600
things are pretty big parts of everyone's life it is certainly a big part of mine

11:56.400 --> 12:03.360
and I don't think they'd show the whole world that it's a pretty big plot hole okay I don't

12:05.120 --> 12:09.120
good morning good evening and in case I don't see you again good night be right back

12:09.120 --> 12:14.560
and then he has diarrhea for 45 minutes I'm gonna I'm gonna say that this is the most frustrating

12:14.560 --> 12:20.320
yahoo answers question we've ever had and I'll tell you why in the movie the truman show when

12:20.320 --> 12:25.760
he is about to make love they deal with that and the camera pans to the curtains it's a whole

12:25.760 --> 12:34.000
fucking scene and they deal with it okay but but but but but but but but but but but maybe a sweet

12:34.000 --> 12:39.280
sweet oh and maybe he wants to show full penetration maybe the camera operator is asleep

12:39.280 --> 12:46.480
at the wheel and they show full jim carrey penetration wouldn't be a great scene in truman

12:46.480 --> 12:51.440
show if they pulled back and the whole time there was just a camera operator standing pretend like

12:51.440 --> 12:56.160
i'm not here what a way to boost it is an artificial way to boost ratings of hey guys

12:56.160 --> 13:01.840
this week it's shit week we're not gonna pan away when he's shitting we put x-lax into all of

13:01.840 --> 13:09.760
truman's meals enjoy why am i shitting so much every week right before christmas every year

13:10.720 --> 13:17.040
it's the truman show christmas special come around gather around the log kids as truman

13:17.040 --> 13:23.280
shits his brains out liquid liquid waste it's a nightmare it's beginning to look a lot like

13:23.280 --> 13:27.760
christmas how does it all end well he's probably gonna shit himself to death because you keep

13:27.760 --> 13:34.160
poisoning him that's what i think i tell you uh i i i don't know if this policy extends to

13:34.160 --> 13:39.280
self-pleasuring but if i had been the star of the truman show the years between middle of middle

13:39.280 --> 13:43.840
school and the end of high school would have featured a lot of pants a lot of camera panning

13:43.840 --> 13:48.640
that go ahead and secure that better homes and gardens sponsorship now top because you are going

13:48.640 --> 13:55.840
to get some prime placement for your curtain top of the credit roll will be courtesy panner and

13:55.840 --> 14:02.400
it's just like from from from 12 to 19 just like that dude is gonna earn that paycheck mom why are

14:02.400 --> 14:08.960
my curtains now covered with the pepsi logo well well because of money because of your sin because

14:08.960 --> 14:14.960
of your sin you did that how much of it there is do you think that if truman had just turned out

14:14.960 --> 14:19.600
to be like a really boring dude and like the show had gotten cancelled they would have murdered him

14:19.600 --> 14:24.960
we should ask the stars of utopia who are currently living through this exact thing oh

14:24.960 --> 14:30.720
god guys on utopia first of all i'm sorry that i cancelled your television show by talking about

14:30.720 --> 14:37.600
it on our podcast um this podcast is basically the indian in the cupboard of reality shows by

14:37.600 --> 14:43.280
which i mean if i say something happens then it becomes real and it becomes extant i i have to

14:43.280 --> 14:48.160
be fucking careful with this power with this crystal power that i've developed and not like

14:48.160 --> 14:53.600
say any shit about survivor or amazing race because i how could i live without those truman

14:53.600 --> 15:00.320
other what other activities would the camera not be able to show if true like what would

15:00.320 --> 15:05.680
you not put in the show what if he was super racist super racist and it was just like hey

15:05.680 --> 15:10.000
can we get like some good influences in there we've tried like the teachers system the parents

15:10.000 --> 15:14.240
who said i don't know where he gets it from i don't know super racist his whole life has been

15:14.240 --> 15:19.920
artificial we've controlled every single element in his life i do not know it has somebody been

15:19.920 --> 15:26.720
sneaking him blue collar comedy has somebody been smuggling blue collar comedy into the biodome

15:26.720 --> 15:32.320
we never yeah we don't really deal with like truman's super excited when he gets out if i

15:32.320 --> 15:37.280
found out that people had filmed everything i had done until i turned like 30 god

15:37.280 --> 15:41.840
woof that is going to be a hard nap for me i'm gonna have to lay down for a little while and

15:41.840 --> 15:46.320
just sort of process that would have been way better in any of that movie if he was like so all

15:46.320 --> 15:55.520
the jerk offs yep every single one because i did 3482 and the audience loved each and every one

15:55.520 --> 16:01.040
and also truman we need to let you know there's a thing called the internet and people have been

16:01.040 --> 16:06.160
tracking these obsessively there are several tumblers devoted to your jerk off schedule

16:06.160 --> 16:12.800
how about another question i do my laundry at the laundromat sometimes when i go to bump my

16:12.800 --> 16:17.200
clothes from the wash to the dryer all the dryers all clothes in them some of the jars won't even

16:17.200 --> 16:20.880
be in the process of drying the clothes clothes will just be hanging out in the dryer taking up

16:20.880 --> 16:25.040
space what's the appropriate amount of time to wait for the owner of the clothes to arrive and

16:25.040 --> 16:28.800
remove their dry clothes before you just get up fed up and take the clothes out and put them on

16:28.800 --> 16:35.040
the counter somewhere so you can use the dryer that's from ornery in oregon when i think about

16:35.040 --> 16:41.200
this i think this just says a lot about me in that i just if i encounter this problem i think

16:41.200 --> 16:46.720
man i'm losing at laundry today i'll wait like i just feel like the other people got there first

16:46.720 --> 16:52.000
they did it better and i am i am losing it well they didn't do it better if they just leave their

16:52.000 --> 16:57.280
fucking garbage in the dryer for six days is that not a worry for other people i mean movies have

16:57.280 --> 17:02.240
made me afraid that people are going to steal my clothes out of out of the dryers can you imagine

17:03.200 --> 17:10.080
it take it took me a long long time to develop my look you guys know this sure yeah me of course

17:10.080 --> 17:20.160
um my look it took me a really long time to discover that my um weird body shape can only

17:20.160 --> 17:26.880
really truly be accommodated by v-neck t-shirts from old navy so maybe not like a lot of work

17:26.880 --> 17:32.800

20:47.520 --> 20:54.160
if i uh god willing live to an elderly age i'm doing this i'm hitting that point

20:56.480 --> 21:03.120
what are you gonna say but like this is your kin yeah shouldn't you be nice to your to your kin

21:03.120 --> 21:08.800
don't you want them to remember you i know how angry i am at people who are younger than me now

21:09.440 --> 21:15.920
i can only imagine that's going to be compounded in the intervening decades yeah don't even be

21:15.920 --> 21:22.240
young around me you want you want your your grandchildren to wear old person makeup when

21:22.240 --> 21:28.080
they walk in the room like spike jones style yeah i think one of my favorite memories of pa pa is

21:28.080 --> 21:33.280
like him sitting there and just whoever else was talking in the room talking at a level that only

21:33.280 --> 21:38.160
you sitting next to him could hear and he would just be like making fun of them or saying shit

21:38.160 --> 21:42.240
about him like yeah just keeps on talking and nobody's really listening and i don't know why

21:42.240 --> 21:45.600
she keeps talking like that like i'd like to talk but nobody else is gonna let me because

21:45.600 --> 21:49.520
she's in there talking to a lot and it was the best thing it was a very subtle burn he had very

21:49.520 --> 21:54.880
subtly spit on your ferret he used to like i remember one time with pa pa we rolled up to

21:54.880 --> 21:58.960
like a taco bell and he just kept saying like i want an apple pie ask them if they have apple pie

21:58.960 --> 22:05.200
and then looking at me and winking like you dick and then mom would try to explain like no no dad

22:05.200 --> 22:12.400
they don't this is talking about it but i want an apple pie wink you dick that's bit commitment

22:12.400 --> 22:16.480
that's the one thing that old people have in spades i think it's just the ability to say i

22:16.480 --> 22:20.000
don't know if this bit's funny or not but i'm gonna lean into it because how many more bits

22:20.000 --> 22:25.120
am i gonna get i don't have an answer to that i'm just gonna go for it i'm gonna go do you think

22:25.120 --> 22:31.440
that pa pa is the reason they started carrying empanada yeah this old dude just keeps coming

22:31.440 --> 22:36.000
through and he just keeps coming back these apple pies i'm missing a whole market i just

22:36.000 --> 22:42.640
thought about like getting home from pa pa's house and like changing into my pajamas and looking on

22:42.640 --> 22:46.560
the back of my shirt and there were boogers on it and not knowing where they came from and i got

22:46.560 --> 22:55.040

there they're all there they're not there they're not there but my favorite thing and i like every

32:00.800 --> 32:06.160
time i turn on hulu i find something on there that either i've forgotten it existed or i just

32:06.160 --> 32:11.040
assumed wouldn't be out to watch yet because it was too new and it's there yesterday i found

32:11.040 --> 32:16.800
garth moran's dark place which is it's hilarious it's like a six episode spoof on like 70s and

32:16.800 --> 32:21.920
80s like horror shows it is the funniest thing i've ever watched and i haven't watched it since

32:21.920 --> 32:27.040
it was on tv and there it is on hulu every episode of the season and like that's all i

32:27.040 --> 32:31.200
did for the rest of the day i was like well this is what i'm doing so i guarantee you it's it's

32:31.200 --> 32:36.960
like 7.99 a month and the greatest value for that money because you're going to find something new

32:36.960 --> 32:42.400
on there every time you look um i guess we could do an antm check in although it seems like they're

32:42.400 --> 32:47.200
fucking calming it down a little bit like they've actually been modeling and not like doing dna

32:47.200 --> 32:56.880
tests and dressing up like uh native american robots um although they did make them act and

32:56.880 --> 33:01.920
that should just be banned from the show from this point on no more acting did aaron sorkin

33:01.920 --> 33:06.880
leave the show it's yes aaron sorkin left the show and now the dialogue has become extremely

sorry sorry i i may have missed the cup of bed streaks on the china and streaks on jism i bet

35:46.320 --> 35:52.000
the secret to getting jism off your china is a little bit of soda water and mustard

35:52.000 --> 35:58.560
fancy mustard grape upon i just on the china

36:02.000 --> 36:06.880
i love that show just scrape a little jism up the china there's a baby waiting for you

36:06.880 --> 36:17.120
you can't go to work like that you're coming in jism

36:18.960 --> 36:25.680
change your shirt i'll launder them honey i think we need to fire mr belvedere i'm too afraid i'm

36:25.680 --> 36:34.080
too afraid i can hear perfectly decades of tantric jisming giving me the ability to hear far beyond

36:34.080 --> 36:40.560
those of mortal men we have ruined this super sweet message that this this person has written

36:40.560 --> 36:45.680
for a baby so anyway oliver welcome to earth it's pretty much like this all the time drab did we

36:45.680 --> 36:52.160
have another message we do it's for sean the bandana mitchell and it's from jen rampage hernandez

36:52.160 --> 36:58.240
fuck yeah there is no chance of this getting to you on time if there is any time left mary jane

36:58.240 --> 37:06.320
loves you and the cuckoo has left the nest you know what to do godspeed hey how come somebody

37:06.320 --> 37:12.400
assassinated joe biden yesterday i don't know uh it must have been uh some sort of weird sort of

37:12.400 --> 37:17.440
activation splinter cell code word oh no the wires got crossed and he just jizzed all over joe

37:17.440 --> 37:28.720
biden oh no no not again yeah yeah he made a biden job uh we don't know what that message was about

37:28.720 --> 37:33.600
but we hope it activated whoever you intended to activate we are not legally responsible for any

37:33.600 --> 37:48.480
activation that happens on usually responsible for any soiling of mr vice president joe biden

37:48.480 --> 37:54.960
co-host of the goose down along with the lovely kimberly clark and we want to invite you into the

37:54.960 --> 38:01.280
comfort and groove of our podcast that encompasses the arts and entertainment you can check us out

38:01.280 --> 38:10.480
at maximalfund.org also available on itunes my girlfriend has started writing a harry potter

38:10.480 --> 38:18.080
fan fiction with two characters loosely based on well hold on okay she has told me that these two

38:18.080 --> 38:23.760
characters eventually end up dating i'm a little worried will her writing reveal uncomfortable

38:23.760 --> 38:28.000
truths about how she sees me or wishes that i was should i stop reading now or am i worried

38:28.000 --> 38:33.040
about nothing that's from confundus charmed in california folks these are the kinds of

38:33.040 --> 38:38.480
questions we need this is a perfect my brother my brother me question thank you and then when

38:38.480 --> 38:44.000
steve the wizard pulled out his wand jenna said sure it's a little small but that's okay i still

38:44.000 --> 38:49.600
love you it's filled honey i want to talk about this paragraph no it's a wand i talked about how

38:49.600 --> 38:54.480
it's phoenix feather and dragon heart string and boy i wish it was thicker just a little bit

38:54.480 --> 39:02.080
um and steve the wizard always chewed with his mouth open and sarah the wizard hated that hey

39:02.080 --> 39:07.280
sarah hey sarah let's talk about this one day sarah the wizard got enchanted dagger and buried

39:07.280 --> 39:12.480
it in his fucking throat because he couldn't keep his goddamn mouth shut and i'm also i'm talking

39:12.480 --> 39:16.720
to you i mean first of all let's talk about the terminology because it doesn't sound like harry

39:16.720 --> 39:21.520
potter fan fiction it sounds like maybe a little bit of extended universe a little bit of eu a

39:21.520 --> 39:26.960
little bit of uh like harry potter tales from the moss isley cantina yeah canon canon g if it's

39:26.960 --> 39:33.200
canon g that's that's perfectly fine because when you say fan fiction i immediately think of you

39:33.200 --> 39:40.320
know a lot of draco's throbbing member and you're thinking of slash fiction right that's synonymous

39:40.320 --> 39:45.280
no fan fiction can be completely uh completely benign and oh yeah have you read a lot of that

39:45.280 --> 39:51.920
well uh no you've read a lot of shadow the hedgehog fucking big the cat's asshole is what

39:51.920 --> 39:58.720
you have read sir i love those uh shadow the hedgehog bigs the cat slash fictions yeah oh were

39:58.720 --> 40:01.920
you laughing because you think that's a thing that doesn't exist or are you laughing because

40:01.920 --> 40:06.400
you know and acknowledge that that is half of all fan fiction no i was laughing because i get

40:06.400 --> 40:11.920
actual enjoyment from reading those it makes me very happy okay good i wasn't i i think that this

40:11.920 --> 40:16.400
question would be more troubling wouldn't you be more troubled question asker if she was writing

40:16.400 --> 40:21.200
two characters loosely based on you who were not dating and instead she was dating like the captain

40:21.200 --> 40:25.120
of the quidditch team that would be more you thought that was you and then it turned out the

40:25.120 --> 40:30.240
capital country has like a weird mole that you don't have wait a minute wait that's not me our

40:30.240 --> 40:38.960
neighbor jerry has a mole though and he's great at quidditch god damn it jerry please don't take her

40:38.960 --> 40:45.600
just because you can i'm sorry i can't catch the golden snitch his snitches are beyond compare

40:47.840 --> 40:49.840
his mole is covered with gross hair

40:52.400 --> 41:01.520
oh jesus with ivory skin and dragons of emerald green okay i this sucks on a lot of different

41:01.520 --> 41:06.800
levels isn't this a great test of like a relationship that first time someone hands

41:06.800 --> 41:12.800
you their fan fiction their manuscripts how you react that will determine the course of

41:12.800 --> 41:20.400
your love forever can i say you guys like i secretly think i would enjoy the hell i write

41:20.400 --> 41:25.760
in fan fiction what universe i would like to enjoy what what universe would you want to dip into

41:26.720 --> 41:33.120
what if i had to write fan fiction in a universe which one would i want to inhabit yes i mean i

41:33.120 --> 41:38.080
wrote a spec office script once which was basically this yeah so that maybe like that

41:38.080 --> 41:43.120
was basically well that was uh that was potentially for a job and it was a good right yeah yeah but

41:43.120 --> 41:48.560
isn't it all fan fiction until someone pays you for it that's a good point yeah i mean when when

41:48.560 --> 41:53.920
jk rowling wrote the original harry potter and the sorcerer's stone that was actually dune fan

41:53.920 --> 41:59.360
fiction not a lot of people know that very little details had to change how house house of tradies

41:59.360 --> 42:04.240
was just house griffin door they just changed the name oh yeah i think i would want to dip

42:04.240 --> 42:10.960
into quantum leap it's so it's such a rich vein god what can't you do i would write the hell out

42:10.960 --> 42:15.840
of some quantum leap oh i want to do one where he leaps into santa claus travis that's a fucking

42:15.840 --> 42:22.880
good idea thank you justin oh and who's i'm ready to meet up with dr who i'm gonna go uh actually

42:22.880 --> 42:27.200
run into the run into the bedroom really quick and grab rachel's laptop and read you guys some

42:27.200 --> 42:32.160
of her quantum leap slash fiction that she's written because that is her favorite show of

42:32.160 --> 42:39.840
all time oh boy yeah i'm leaving i'm leaving i know what you're thinking there's a lot of

42:39.840 --> 42:45.280
hologram sex involved and you know what i'm thinking that you're absolutely right yes

42:45.280 --> 42:54.480
congratulations swiss cheese memory and an ass like gruyere oh my god don't she still manages

42:54.480 --> 43:00.080
to write in a scene where scott bacula gets to sing though because it's in his writer i'll let

43:00.080 --> 43:04.960
you i'll fuck a physical manifestation of ziggy and i'll have hologram sex too but you gotta let

43:04.960 --> 43:11.520
me dress up like the big bumper okay scott that is an iron clag contract when he anticipated slash

43:11.520 --> 43:17.280
fiction yep in case like 25 years from now people are writing on the internet about me having sex

43:17.280 --> 43:26.240
with ziggy i have to sing in those in those stories come on donald belisario you want me

43:26.240 --> 43:29.600
i've talked about this before but how fucking good would like an adventure game series set in

43:29.600 --> 43:34.080
quantum leap be i think about it and i get so excited i could write that is that is that fan

43:34.080 --> 43:38.640
fiction are you about it telltale are you talking about like a video game scenario like yes card

43:38.640 --> 43:44.000
game scenario no no no video game scenario be so fucking tight i would write it for free you can

43:44.000 --> 43:48.480
make any game into a quantum leap game by just having a scene at the beginning where he leaps

43:48.480 --> 43:53.600
like there's very few distinguishing features of it other than the leaping it's not like he gets

43:53.600 --> 43:57.520
super strength or anything cool like that you could do it right now just by editing in like

43:57.520 --> 44:01.840
scenes into video games where like just for one second he looks at the camera and says like oh

44:01.840 --> 44:06.000
boy and then you just keep going you're like holy wait hold on is this a quantum leap game

44:06.960 --> 44:12.880
is gold my a quantum leap game did we talk about quantum loop slash fan fiction enough that will

44:12.880 --> 44:16.720
actually be forced into making some because i really want to write some fan fiction isn't

44:16.720 --> 44:21.840
everyone just looking for an excuse to write some fan fiction like i guess i guess i need to do a

44:21.840 --> 44:26.480
patreon where we just write a quantum leap i gotta do it it's for the donors yeah i don't want to

44:26.480 --> 44:34.720
write fan fiction uh this yahoo was sent in by level 700 yahoo shaman drew davenport thank you

44:34.720 --> 44:43.440
drew it's by yahoo answers user joe who asks chris angel versus santa claus who who is more magical

44:43.440 --> 44:50.000
i don't want to ruin it but i'm going down through the dozens of responses to this question dozens

44:50.000 --> 44:56.320
of people who decided this is going to be worth their while uh it is almost entirely chris angel

44:56.320 --> 45:04.240
almost all in chris angel's corner serious question yeah if it was revealed that chris angel was some

45:04.240 --> 45:11.600
kind of like suck you incubus character some kind of actual like demon person would you be shocked

45:11.600 --> 45:17.200
at all if he was some sort of nephilim yes if it turned out that he was like an agent of mephistopheles

45:17.200 --> 45:22.480
and like had some unearthly powers if it turned out he was an agent of mr mistopheles

45:25.040 --> 45:31.040
if he was a jellicle cat if it turned out that he was a jellicle cat and ascended to the heavy

45:31.040 --> 45:36.080
time layer or whatever it's called would you be shocked let me see i'm going to show you a trick

45:36.080 --> 45:44.240
hand me those sardines i love them i love these things i love them shits now watch this i'm going

45:44.240 --> 45:48.880
to put a sword through my belly look at that sand over there you see how smooth and not chunky that

45:48.880 --> 45:56.480
sand is can you check this out poopy poop poop poop sweet sweet did you like my magic

45:56.480 --> 46:06.000
check out that laser pointer you want to say hold on oh yeah i tell you guys something this is truth

46:06.000 --> 46:15.680
yeah when i was a young child i saw uh david copperfield on tv performing his uh illusion

46:15.680 --> 46:21.840
of flight uh perhaps one of you could wikipedia that to find out the exact year and the name of

46:21.840 --> 46:27.840
that special because it was something amazing but i watched his illusion of flight and in my young

46:27.840 --> 46:37.280
mind as a as a young boy i entertained seriously entertained for the span of a few days afterwards

46:37.840 --> 46:48.640
that david copperfield may maybe maybe an angel i thought wait now don't laugh no i'm going to

46:48.640 --> 46:56.720
fuck you no i thought that david copperfield in his special his flight 1992 perfect 12 that's

46:56.720 --> 47:01.840
exactly where i thought i was i i and what was the name of that special do you do you have that on

47:01.840 --> 47:09.520
hand uh the magic of david copperfield 14 flying hyphen live the dream calm the fuck down david

47:09.520 --> 47:19.600
copperfield name davey so i was so stumped by how he did this trick i entertained that he was an

47:19.600 --> 47:29.600
angel who has was on earth to re-convince the people that miracles can happen i thought that

47:29.600 --> 47:36.240
david copperfield was perhaps an angel and that was the best explanation can i just say like

47:36.240 --> 47:42.080
it being the 90s i'm amazed that that wasn't like a movie or a tv special or something where it's

47:42.080 --> 47:45.920
like you know who's popular right now that david copperfield people love the angels and stuff so

47:45.920 --> 47:49.440
let's make it where he's really doing magic and solving crimes that was that was actually the

47:49.440 --> 47:54.160
finale of the secrets of magic revealed that the masked magician who's like putting everybody on

47:54.160 --> 48:00.240
blast like and here's the secret behind david copperfield he's a fucking angel guys like i

48:00.240 --> 48:04.960
fucking i've looked at that shit through every angle and this guy's a motherfucking angel i have

48:04.960 --> 48:09.360
no idea why can't we see his halo that's the great magic trick he made that shit disappear

48:09.360 --> 48:13.520
he must have linked it with another ring and then pulled it off his fucking head he actually had to

48:13.520 --> 48:19.040
set he had to give up his halo when he revealed his abilities to earth people is that how it works

48:19.920 --> 48:28.080
in my fan fiction yesterday my roommate of five plus years walked in our room and asked to borrow

48:28.080 --> 48:33.360
my nail clippers like it was the most normal thing in the world i had two questions for you guys but

48:33.360 --> 48:39.200
first the but the answers were real obvious is that okay no how do you say no to that no you

48:39.200 --> 48:45.040
may not use my nail clippers the real question at the root of this is how do i figure out what

48:45.040 --> 48:50.160
other weird stuff he thinks is normal and that's from well please don't use my nail clippers in

48:50.160 --> 48:56.720
pittsburgh first off thanks for handling our light work i don't think it's that weird

48:56.720 --> 49:04.960
what what now the nail clipper borrowing sorry what travis yeah i know i feel like i should

49:04.960 --> 49:09.520
but like i think if brent in college had walked into my room and said like hey can i borrow your

49:09.520 --> 49:15.760
nail clippers i wouldn't have thought twice about it i would have just handed it to and said here

49:15.760 --> 49:22.240
you go good friend okay but when i use nail clippers i don't just like clip my nails i get

49:22.240 --> 49:28.320
in there yeah i get i mean i do some work in there some reconstructive work yeah you get

49:28.320 --> 49:35.200
out the the the speculum that's one of the attachments isn't it so is the fear that okay

49:35.200 --> 49:40.240
is the fear like a that their feet are so gross you're going to catch something from like their

49:40.240 --> 49:49.440
fingernails why do i have to spell this out for you like their nail clippers uh-huh it's gross

49:49.440 --> 49:52.640
everything and you're worried about the feet i'm more worried about the hands because everything

49:52.640 --> 49:58.000
you ever touch including your butthole is going to get under there and then it's going to get on

49:58.000 --> 50:04.320
there and then it's going to get on your shit when you touch it what kind of honey pots of items can

50:04.320 --> 50:08.800
you leave around the house just to see if you'll pick them up and utilize them and make yourself

50:08.800 --> 50:13.840
look like a chair as you like document it and being okay use my toothbrush i need to move out

50:13.840 --> 50:22.240
and now you're sitting on me jerked off on my china okay it's not explicitly what that's for

50:23.200 --> 50:24.880
wish you'd jerk off on your own china

50:29.280 --> 50:34.240
