The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.640 --> 00:47.600
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother, my brother, me, and the advice show for the

00:47.600 --> 00:51.520
modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis

00:51.520 --> 00:58.880
McElroy. And I'm your sweet baby baby, Griffin the Swamp Thing McElroy. Hey, Swamp Thing,

00:58.880 --> 01:03.680
we're so happy you could make it on the program. Get off that hoverboat, what's you afraid of?

01:03.680 --> 01:09.680
You're gonna get your feet all swampy, that's a good Earth down in there. Justin, stop interrupting

01:09.680 --> 01:14.240
him, just let him talk like that. Join my hydration specialist, Griffin McElroy. Grab

01:14.240 --> 01:21.040
yourself a hurricane, baby, grab yourself a- wait, where am I going now? Where in the world is-

01:21.040 --> 01:30.960
Griffin, hold on tight, this magic carpet of axes is backing hard. Is it gonna be the deep

01:30.960 --> 01:35.920
south? Wait, where is this house? Is this Florida? Griffin's just fluctuating back and forth across

01:35.920 --> 01:41.040
the Gulf of Mexico. I'm a mystified Floridian, and I've never seen anything like this before.

01:41.040 --> 01:53.520
And on here we go, back to the Zatarans. All right, Foghorn Lozitico, maybe you could tell

01:53.520 --> 02:01.120
us why your accent has been so impacted. I just got back from Nolans, where I had myself a lot of

02:01.120 --> 02:09.200
ratatouille. On the plane there, I watched the movie Ratatouille. I went down to Nolans,

02:09.200 --> 02:16.960
and a mouse cooked me all my meat. I walked around for like fucking 100 miles, because they

02:16.960 --> 02:22.880
haven't invented public transportation yet down in Nolans, and I did develop myself a hemorrhoid

02:22.880 --> 02:31.600
big enough to draw a face on. A lot of times when you're in New Orleans, you will ask that a mouse

02:31.600 --> 02:35.600
prepare your food, but you really need to go back into the kitchen to make sure, because they will

02:35.600 --> 02:42.080
try to tell you that a mouse has prepared your food. A lot of times, it's a possum. It's not even

02:42.080 --> 02:48.000
a mouse. Or it's a guy named Possum. Got myself a flank steak, 16 ounces. How's a mouse even gonna

02:48.000 --> 02:53.520
pick up something that big? You tell me that. You can't do it. Don't be afraid of this swamp water.

02:55.120 --> 03:00.800
Did you take Traveler? Oh God, yeah. That's Savannah, Georgia. Well, no, you can do that.

03:00.800 --> 03:04.960
As long as it's an open plastic container, you can drink whatever the fuck. You can drink heroin

03:04.960 --> 03:10.480
out of it, as long as it's an open solo cup. Did you get into any voodoo? No, I didn't.

03:10.480 --> 03:17.040
Did you eat any voodoo donuts? I ate 12 voodoo donuts, and every time I did, a bigger donut

03:17.600 --> 03:28.960
was destroyed. That's how it works. Travis was staring at that big donut out in LA,

03:28.960 --> 03:33.280
and it just all of a sudden started evaporating. It just got completely wrecked. I assume Griffin

03:33.280 --> 03:37.600
traveled back in time and stopped the donuts' parents from eating. With a time-traveling

03:37.600 --> 03:44.880
voodoo donut. What are we doing? I don't know. This sounds like we're reciting the lyrics of

03:44.880 --> 03:52.960
a Cherry Pomadaddy's record. Time-traveling voodoo donuts. Come on out with the flank steak made by

03:52.960 --> 03:58.800
a mouse. Okay. That's where Brian sets her territory. You know what, Kmart? This is worth

03:58.800 --> 04:05.440
the $3.99 I paid for the CD. I'm glad I made this versus this is a worthy follow-up. No,

04:06.000 --> 04:11.920
I had a terrific time in Nolens. I was kidding about going near swamp water. Not so much about

04:11.920 --> 04:20.560
the hemorrhoid. If you haven't listened to our podcast before, what we do is we take your

04:20.560 --> 04:27.440
questions, we mix them up with a little Cajun spice, and then we turn them into wisdom. Got

04:27.440 --> 04:33.120
that. Got that Creole comedy. Creole comedy. Right here on my brother, my brother and me.

04:33.120 --> 04:39.840
Let's get into it. Every time I hold open two doors in a row, like walking out of a shopping

04:39.840 --> 04:44.880
mall, I'm not sure if I should expect the person to thank me twice or if the initial thank you for

04:44.880 --> 04:49.440
the first door is implied for the second door. Vice versa, if someone holds open two doors for

04:49.440 --> 04:55.200
me, should I say thank you both times or just the one for everything? That's from the curious,

04:55.200 --> 05:02.160
courteous Canuck in Canada. I'm confused by the question because me too. I always understood it

05:02.160 --> 05:07.680
to be whoever holds the first door door walks through the second door while you hold it.

05:08.240 --> 05:15.200
Right. So a World War Two veteran, a 102 year old World War Two veteran, you say,

05:15.200 --> 05:20.640
hey, Frank, what the fuck? I thought we had each other there. Otherwise, Griffin, what you're

05:20.640 --> 05:26.000
looking at is I open first door, right? Person walks through, then they wait for me to then get

05:26.000 --> 05:30.720
to the second door. It's like if they have to wait, if they have to wait, you fucked up. You

05:30.720 --> 05:38.960
got to juke around them. What is this weird Cinderella's footman like idea? Excuse me.

05:38.960 --> 05:43.840
Let's get the second door for you. I'm saying that's what's expected of you when you run into

05:43.840 --> 05:50.640
a 100, a surviving member of the greatest generation. If you juke around them- One of

05:50.640 --> 05:56.000
Nick Fury's howling commandos. But if they don't thank you again, fuck them forever. I don't care

05:56.000 --> 05:58.720
if you were on the beaches of Normandy. Well, it's hard for them to thank you because they're constantly

05:58.720 --> 06:07.520
howling. Well, I don't think that was a thing. I think it's weird to hold open both doors. I think

06:07.520 --> 06:14.560
that the person would probably be so distracted by your desperate need to touch doors that they

06:14.560 --> 06:17.920
wouldn't think to say thank you twice. They would be too busy thinking, what are they doing?

06:19.520 --> 06:25.200
So it's a thank you and then a what the fuck? What are you doing? At what point is holding

06:25.200 --> 06:31.120
the door open just become such standard courtesy that it's just like, oh no, you can only go

06:31.120 --> 06:37.360
negative if you don't do it. The courtesy is to hold open the door. To me now, if I'm

06:37.360 --> 06:42.000
like walking through a door and someone's right behind me and I don't hold it, I'm like, oh,

06:42.000 --> 06:46.960
I'm a jerk. And when I do hold it, I'm like, oh, I'm just a human being. Like I'm just a normal

06:46.960 --> 06:52.400
person who didn't close a door in someone's face. It's not courtesy. It's just like basic human

06:52.400 --> 06:59.600
nature. So I don't think I should, I don't need to be thanked for that. Like you not hating me

06:59.600 --> 07:05.200
is thanks enough. My periphery's all fucked up. I basically don't have it. I'm basically a horse

07:05.200 --> 07:12.720
with those cool horse glasses on. And I never know when a human being's behind me, which would

07:12.720 --> 07:20.000
make me very vulnerable and say like a ninja scenario or just a sneaky murderer. I would just

07:20.000 --> 07:27.120
have no idea. There could be one behind me right now. Hold on. There's not. No, not. So I almost

07:27.120 --> 07:32.080
never hold the door open in the style that Travis has just described, where it's just like you walk

07:32.080 --> 07:37.840
through it and maybe you give it like an extra second or two of leverage. I fucked that up a lot,

07:37.840 --> 07:42.960
which my wife can attest to. Cause I just, I, she has seen me fuck that up a lot with her perfect

07:42.960 --> 07:48.480
periphery. It is often a very funny moment to me though, where like I see someone go through a door

07:48.480 --> 07:53.840
in front of me. They let go of the door, then see that I'm there and you watch their hand, like kind

07:53.840 --> 07:58.240
of as they're like, should I, I should I grab it? No, it's too late now. Just got to keep going.

07:58.240 --> 08:02.160
We could do a whole episode about door holding. Cause what's the etiquette of when you hold it

08:02.160 --> 08:05.360
and then the person who's coming actually slows way down. Or maybe they're just much slower.

08:07.360 --> 08:15.760
There is no, there is no worse lock of the gaze than I opening this door for you and you are too

08:15.760 --> 08:21.280
far away and we both know it. And I don't know where we go from here. If you speed up, I feel bad.

08:21.280 --> 08:26.480
If you slow down, then you're going to feel awkward about it. And I don't know where we go from here.

08:26.480 --> 08:32.480
Going to feel awkward about it is a nightmare. The only thing worse than that is the, um,

08:32.480 --> 08:36.160
like the church letting out where you hold up in the door for one person and pretty soon,

08:36.160 --> 08:40.400
like 30 people are walking through. Yeah. And you're stuck in that like, Oh, when do I let go?

08:41.040 --> 08:44.480
At some point you have to just let it go and walk. Yeah. I w I would actually agree with you,

08:44.480 --> 08:51.600
Travis. That is the only worst thing. I meant in a door context. Do you guys want a Yahoo?

08:51.600 --> 08:57.040
Sure. Uh, this Yahoo was sent in. Wait, I have a question that I meant to ask. Oops.

08:57.840 --> 09:02.720
How do they do it in Japan Griffin? How would I hold a door open? Uh, the Japanese style.

09:02.720 --> 09:08.960
Well, I'm glad that you've asked this, Justin. Um, all of the doors in Japan are hard light

09:08.960 --> 09:14.560
holograms. Do you guys want to Yahoo or not? Fucking tell me, tell me now. Yeah. I am going to

09:14.560 --> 09:19.760
get in the Japanese style going as my brother. We'll get some fucking hard light hologram doors

09:19.760 --> 09:25.680
and stop fucking tipping. Uh, this Yahoo was sent in by Drew Davenport, level billion Drew,

09:25.680 --> 09:32.480
Drew shaman. He is a shaman of the Drew arts. Thank you. A Druid. What the fuck? How have we

09:32.480 --> 09:39.840
been fucking this up this long? Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Uh, Drew, it's by Yahoo answers user, just me

09:39.840 --> 09:49.840
who asks. Okay. They land on Mars. Then what? Like, what are they going to do? Good question.

09:55.520 --> 10:00.160
That is going to cross somebody's mind when they come down. Like, I never thought we'd get this

10:00.160 --> 10:06.720
far. We didn't really plan. Oh fuck. Actually. Um, look guys, I found a rock. Yeah, me too.

10:06.720 --> 10:11.920
Fuck. Okay. Bring any bags or anything to put the rocks in or yeah. I mean, they're not coming back.

10:11.920 --> 10:15.760
Like this is this mission. What is it? Like a hundred people like get there and they're like

10:15.760 --> 10:19.440
fucking, all right, we're here. We're the first people to die on Mars. We're going to have a

10:19.440 --> 10:26.560
Martian baby. Fuck. It's super fucked up. Let's um, okay. There's nothing funnier to me. Like,

10:26.560 --> 10:32.240
obviously I think like, I don't know. I'm sort of a mix of, of two minds about the whole, like

10:32.240 --> 10:38.640
going to like live on Mars. Like, that's your life if you want to spend it that way. I, you know,

10:38.640 --> 10:42.000
it's like you're going to be alone. There's going to be other people there. That's fine. It's not

10:42.000 --> 10:47.360
actually going to happen by the way, but like, I think that's, that's fine. What I like is the,

10:49.040 --> 10:55.280
the decision that they definitely aren't going to be able to figure out a way back. Like it is not

10:55.280 --> 11:01.200
even on the list of like- That would probably be day two. Day one. We did some experiments on some

11:01.200 --> 11:07.280
rocks. Day two. Should we like try and build another ship? Can we turn these rocks into fuel?

11:07.280 --> 11:12.080
Because they just fucking launched House of Cards season three. And I would very much like to see

11:12.080 --> 11:17.840
that before I die in 60 years. All I know is that for me, like every time I pack to like go to San

11:17.840 --> 11:22.080
Francisco, you know, three hours away, I'm like, Ooh, what am I forgetting? And Teresa always

11:22.080 --> 11:26.880
reminds me, don't worry. Like they have toothbrushes there. You know, they have socks there.

11:26.880 --> 11:33.520
Yeah. Not so much with Mars. What if you land and you're like, Oh, I didn't bring socks. Socks.

11:33.520 --> 11:39.680
I forgot socks. Can anyone get on the wifi yet? Oh no, you can't. Cause we're- Is it any? We fucked

11:39.680 --> 11:45.360
up because we're on the fourth rock from the sun. Say you're going to Mars, huh? Yeah. How do you

11:45.360 --> 11:50.720
think, how do you think the effort to make another ship there is going to go? Well, bad. Well, I don't

11:50.720 --> 11:56.000
know how to make biscuits from scratch. So probably not build the rocket ship. Do they have, they don't

11:56.000 --> 12:05.200
have water per se. And I've heard that's important vis-a-vis living. I thought we would just go to

12:05.200 --> 12:11.440
Mars. NASA doesn't, they don't have it here. Can I, Hey guys, I'm going to Mars tomorrow for the

12:11.440 --> 12:16.560
rest of my life. Can anyone recommend any good iPad games I can download for the trip that will

12:16.560 --> 12:22.240
last me for the rest of my life? I've heard this monument Valley game is good. Will it last me for

12:22.240 --> 12:30.560
the rest of my life? Well, I also might need a battery backup. What, what the phrase the rest

12:30.560 --> 12:36.080
of your life means is vastly different when you're headed to a planet that does not have water on it.

12:36.080 --> 12:39.920
Cause that raises a lot more question marks about exactly how long of a span we're talking about.

12:39.920 --> 12:45.840
Cause if it did fucking interstellar would have been a much shorter film and much better film.

12:45.840 --> 12:50.000
I would say 20 minutes. We need to find life on another planet. There's Mars. I guess we can just

12:50.000 --> 12:56.640
like fucking cab over there. Can we share an Uber? Okay, here we are. They also have decided that

12:56.640 --> 13:01.920
like, it's also a sort of negative saying like, yeah, we're going to go die on Mars. It's kind of

13:01.920 --> 13:07.840
a weird like a point of view on how you think humanity's space travel development is going to

13:07.840 --> 13:13.280
go. Hey, do you think in your lifetime humanity will have a rocket that can get both to Mars and

13:13.280 --> 13:18.080
back? Like that doesn't seem that crazy when you think about it. Like all you need is a ship that

13:18.080 --> 13:22.640
can make the return journey. Like Justin, how many people do you think sit there and go,

13:22.640 --> 13:28.160
I'm going to go die on Mars. That's what they're doing. That's what they're doing. That's what

13:28.160 --> 13:33.360
they're all doing, Travis. Like that is the, that is the deal. None of them have have like,

13:33.360 --> 13:37.440
are even thinking about a return trip like that. This is what they're doing. Do you think they just

13:37.440 --> 13:41.280
finished Breaking Bad and we're like, well, that's it. That's as good as it gets. So I'm

13:41.280 --> 13:45.440
not going to get any better than that. These people are heroes. And then they're like in the

13:45.440 --> 13:52.800
ship and they see a billboard as they're flying out for Better Call Saul. I would love that

13:52.800 --> 13:59.520
character. I love my kids or whatever. Send me back. I think you can own these people are science

13:59.520 --> 14:03.840
heroes and we're goofing on them and we shouldn't be because they're fucking science heroes.

14:03.840 --> 14:08.480
And I'm fucking, I am picking up what they are putting down in a major way. But what are y'all

14:08.480 --> 14:16.320
going to do up there for real though? Give me a team of like 85 year olds and shoot them up there.

14:16.320 --> 14:23.520
Fucking space cowboys too. Let's go die together on Mars. Cool. I'm fine with that because you can,

14:23.520 --> 14:30.720
you can squeeze fucking 15 years out of euchre. You can squeeze 15 years out of the game hearts.

14:30.720 --> 14:36.000
I bring a super hard puzzle. Just bring up a billion piece puzzle and you're cool.

14:36.000 --> 14:39.520
You're probably even going to have a better time up there than you would in Florida,

14:39.520 --> 14:50.240
but like fucking, oh man, what are you doing? Like 185 year olds and one like totally tubular

14:50.240 --> 14:57.280
15 year old and his skateboard. Cause the lesson gravity is going to make for some six

14:57.280 --> 15:02.880
sick tricks while all the 85 year olds are like, stop skateboarding on Mars. And I want to watch

15:02.880 --> 15:09.520
that movie. Cut to, cut to, uh, cut to the mom just shouting. We forgot Kevin on the spaceship

15:09.520 --> 15:15.360
to Mars. He's going to Mars. Planet alone. Home alone five. He's going to do sick kickflips,

15:16.480 --> 15:26.160
but also die on Mars. Next question. I love watching X-Files, but sometimes it's just a

15:26.160 --> 15:30.560
little too freaky watching at night by myself. No one will watch it with me. And I have a vividly

15:30.560 --> 15:35.840
active imagination. How do I cure my heebie-jeebies so I can watch my show without having night

15:35.840 --> 15:43.440
terrors? That's from in Oklahoma. I hope I said that right. I get it. I like, I am with you. I

15:43.440 --> 15:48.720
like spooky stuff, but I have to keep it in the daytime hours. Rachel and I have actually stopped

15:48.720 --> 15:54.000
watching walking dead. Well, we should probably just stop watching walking dead period. Uh,

15:54.000 --> 15:57.920
but we have stopped making it the last thing we watch before we go to bedtime. Not just because

15:57.920 --> 16:04.960
it's like scary or whatever, because it isn't. Um, but it is fucking depressing. And that's my bigger

16:04.960 --> 16:11.200
thing is like, if a show is going to be just sort of unswervingly dark, I fucked up last night. I

16:11.200 --> 16:15.840
watched the house of cards season three, a first episode, which has some, let's call it dark material

16:15.840 --> 16:21.600
in it. And fuck my, fuck my rims up, fuck my rim cycle right up. And I wish I hadn't done it. So I

16:21.600 --> 16:27.200
feel you just got to set a timer on that shit. I was walking dead where it was like, we can't do

16:27.200 --> 16:31.840
this the last thing before we go to sleep. And then it was, we can't watch this, you know,

16:31.840 --> 16:36.640
when we're just a couple hours away from bed. And then it was, we can't watch it after six.

16:36.640 --> 16:41.440
And then it just, and then it was, we can't watch it because they're not fucking doing anything on

16:41.440 --> 16:46.000
that show anymore. They're just walking around and dying. It's a good name for the show because

16:46.000 --> 16:52.400
they're just walking around and then one of them will die. They should just, why don't you just

16:52.400 --> 16:57.840
like watch X-Files with your morning coffee? Like to start your day, you're going to watch a dude

16:57.840 --> 17:03.440
crawl through like an air duct and dislocate his bones and eat someone's liver or whatever,

17:03.440 --> 17:08.000
while you sip on your coffee and eat your Cheerios. Jumpstart your day with some spooks

17:08.000 --> 17:15.840
and some scares. Jumpstart your way the scully way. X-Files. The best part of waking up

17:15.840 --> 17:23.760
is a boneless man in your ducts eating your liver. Because for me, like what I, I would watch stupid

17:23.760 --> 17:28.800
scary stuff. Like, are you afraid of the dark? And the episodes that were legit, just like goofy and

17:28.800 --> 17:34.640
stupid. But then my brain would kick over to like, yo, that was stupid, but what if? And then pretty

17:34.640 --> 17:38.800
soon I was up till four o'clock in the morning. Yeah. And I'm talking about like a week ago. I'm

17:38.800 --> 17:43.760
a grown ass man and still my overactive imagination does that shit. So just watch in the morning and

17:43.760 --> 17:50.240
then watch a bunch of SpongeBob and like wash it away. Jesus Christ, Travis. Is it, is it just,

17:50.240 --> 17:54.960
is it just Nickelodeon programming for you from this point on? Listen, I have, I have a very

17:54.960 --> 17:59.680
particular set of tastes and it's basically like, I only enjoy things for children. You've got,

17:59.680 --> 18:06.960
you've got Jack disease, but culturally. I actually like that. Uh, I actually like that chaser idea

18:06.960 --> 18:11.680
of you watch something, but then, you know, you sneak a gravity falls or something like that in

18:11.680 --> 18:16.560
right after it. Someone's going to pick your spirits right up. And, uh, uh, parks and rec

18:16.560 --> 18:22.800
is great for this. Antiques road show. Okay. Well, no, but sure. Oh, see, I only enjoy things for,

18:22.800 --> 18:28.880
uh, five year olds or 85 year old. That's why either I'm going to watch like, um,

18:28.880 --> 18:34.080
avatar, the last airbender, or I'm going to watch, uh, you know, like property brothers.

18:34.080 --> 18:39.040
Travis has both Jack and Benjamin button. So some, you would think he was like right in the

18:39.040 --> 18:43.840
time of his life where he met in the middle and like carried himself like a grown ass man,

18:44.480 --> 18:50.320
but no, because they both reversed and turned around. And now he's got Benjamin button and Jack

18:50.320 --> 18:56.000
on either side, book ending him, trapping him in a prison of his own creation.

18:57.280 --> 19:01.280
As I worked through grad school, I nanny for a beautiful one and a half year old girl.

19:01.280 --> 19:04.800
I love spending time with her and I can't complain about the money.

19:04.800 --> 19:08.400
However, when I take her on the town, I'm often confused for her mother.

19:08.400 --> 19:12.560
Should I try to let admirers know that she isn't my child? This has led to some awkward situations

19:12.560 --> 19:18.080
like the time I responded to what a beautiful baby you have with, oh, she's not mine. I just

19:18.080 --> 19:22.400
found her like this. Well, don't say that. Don't say that. Especially not with that inflection

19:22.400 --> 19:26.960
I just unintentionally gave you. Brothers, how can I let people know that I'm a nanny and not a mom

19:26.960 --> 19:31.920
without a call to the police? That's from Kidless in California. Might I suggest a broom

19:31.920 --> 19:38.400
and a carpet bag and an umbrella and not a broom. Okay. Cause I forgot what Mary Poppins.

19:38.400 --> 19:42.720
A witch's broom, an umbrella, some steam punk goggles.

19:43.520 --> 19:50.720
Okay. I heard, I heard aerobics and I heard a Mexican restaurant. Okay. Now I need a scenario.

19:52.160 --> 19:58.880
Sweating up the check. Okay, here we go. How about, hey, how about number one nanny

19:58.880 --> 20:07.040
shirt shirt. Yeah. Some kind of branding. Can we, is this something, listen, Facebook for me

20:07.040 --> 20:14.000
has become, well, a prison of my own creation. Um, so many things in your life are a prison of

20:14.000 --> 20:17.840
your own creation. And if you take a look around, you're, you're really going to start to see the

20:17.840 --> 20:23.360
bars showing, but, um, Facebook for me, that's liberation. That's the first step to liberation.

20:23.360 --> 20:28.400
Remember the con is on the con is on realize you're already in a prison of your own creation.

20:28.400 --> 20:34.480
90% of Facebook to me is advertisements for, uh, let's see, I got one this morning,

20:34.480 --> 20:40.800
but it's like, it's an Austin thing. You wouldn't understand it. Uh, or, uh, don't worry. Leave it

20:40.800 --> 20:45.680
up to Griffin McElroy. Like it's like the fucking like books that your parents would get made for

20:45.680 --> 20:51.120
you. Like Griffin's a six year old space astronaut. He's going to Mars to die. Like those books that

20:51.120 --> 20:56.240
Facebook has basically become that for me. Are we missing out on a nanny centric market of people

20:56.240 --> 21:04.640
who are fucking, how about this nanny and proud of it? You didn't let me finish nanny and proud of it.

21:07.440 --> 21:13.200
Put that shit on a shirt. If every nanny buys it, we're Brazilian airs. What about a t-shirt says

21:13.200 --> 21:20.320
it's not my baby. Gotta love me. Because cultural aspect and then on the back, because I'm a nanny

21:20.320 --> 21:28.000
and I love it. I'm very proud. I guess doesn't have the pride. I feel with completing a good

21:28.000 --> 21:32.480
job of watching this child. That's not mine. How about front side? I'm not a booboo nanny.

21:32.480 --> 21:38.560
And then on the backside, just, I'm just a regular nanny and I love it. Love it so damn much. You

21:38.560 --> 21:46.080
can't spell awesome without au pair. You can't spell awesome pair without au pair kind of,

21:46.080 --> 21:51.600
and even then not. And even then it's a stretch. You can't, you can't spell Australian pair without

21:51.600 --> 21:59.360
au pair. There we go. Maybe. Yes. Might be a bit of a reach. Are you Australian? I think there's

21:59.360 --> 22:07.920
some symbols like an umlaut or French umlaut on there. Can you change something about the baby

22:07.920 --> 22:13.200
to make it clear that you two are not related? Can you make the baby a different race than you? Can

22:13.200 --> 22:18.720
you reroll the baby? Can you change the baby's characteristics? Is it too late to respec this

22:18.720 --> 22:25.200
baby? We just changed Drew from a shaman to a druid. So I don't think it's outside the realm

22:25.200 --> 22:30.160
of possibilities that maybe your baby is now a ranger. Oh, I can tell this isn't your baby. It's

22:30.160 --> 22:35.840
a tiefling. This is a tiefling baby. I understand. Justin, hold on, because we did gloss over it.

22:35.840 --> 22:44.160
Did you just maybe suggest baby blackface? I don't think I definitely did. I think it's

22:44.160 --> 22:49.600
maybe open to interpretation what you said. And perhaps my interpretation is just one of many

22:49.600 --> 22:54.800
because there's a lot of beautiful races out there. Yeah. I think that, I think this is a

22:54.800 --> 22:58.880
situation a lot like when people say like, Hey, how's it going? All you got to say when they're

22:58.880 --> 23:03.680
like, Oh, what a beautiful little girl. Just say, thank you. I don't think you need to say like,

23:03.680 --> 23:09.680
she's not mine. Oh, I don't want to mislead you. This isn't my baby. Like, okay. Yeah. Cool. Super

23:09.680 --> 23:14.480
cool. Like I don't really care transaction where that information becomes important. Like you're

23:14.480 --> 23:19.120
selling it. Like I don't think that you're selling the baby. Why are you selling the baby? That's

23:19.120 --> 23:24.960
like the worst. I'll pair all pairing that you could do. That's like number one of the three

23:24.960 --> 23:34.960
laws of pairing. Don't sell the kids. You can't harm the kid unless the kid asks you to harm it.

23:34.960 --> 23:39.680
I have to reread Isaac Asimov because I've forgotten the rest. And also look out. It's Will

23:39.680 --> 23:46.000
Smith. Oh, I feel like I would be. He's got a baby arm. The kid is Alan Tudyk. Do you guys think I

23:46.000 --> 23:51.040
would be a good au pair? Oh, for sure. Yeah. I feel that in my heart that like that would have

23:51.040 --> 23:57.120
been a good career path. If the baby just wants to chill. I think if the baby wants to, if the

23:57.120 --> 24:02.240
baby wants to sketch up on a skateboard and do some truck tricks. Hey, Uncle Justin, it's time

24:02.240 --> 24:09.520
to get active. I don't think so. All right. Our first activity is why don't you bring me a laptop

24:09.520 --> 24:14.800
and load up to monster.com for me? Cause I'm going to need a new career path. I actually did that

24:14.800 --> 24:19.920
when I babysat and the kid was like, I'm going to go outside and play basketball. I'm like, or

24:19.920 --> 24:25.280
we could watch SpongeBob. What would you think about that? Huh? On the couch time, not going

24:25.280 --> 24:30.880
outside for you and me. We can go on a couch adventure. Use our imaginations. We can go

24:30.880 --> 24:35.760
wherever you want. Like I want to go to the park. I want to play in the creek in the park. It's like,

24:35.760 --> 24:39.920
it's like around the corner. It's like in one block over, we can go to the park and just like

24:39.920 --> 24:46.400
throw a frisbee around or we can go on a couch mind adventure and we could pretend that we're

24:46.400 --> 24:52.080
in a park throwing frisbee, but like we could easily super do that thing and it would be like

24:52.080 --> 24:59.120
super duper easy. If you love nature so much, why don't you check out the Phoenix on my computer?

24:59.120 --> 25:04.960
Cause this is Phoenix online and I'm going back to college. I love that Justin's, Justin's imagining

25:04.960 --> 25:10.480
of him being on a career path involves him quitting that job. So deep are those roots in Justin's

25:10.480 --> 25:16.880
mind. Yeah. So deep are Justin's commitment issues to a career path. Yeah. Just completely. Yeah. I

25:16.880 --> 25:21.680
can't be that. I can't find, well, how are you going to advertise that you want a less active

25:21.680 --> 25:28.000
kid? Like, do you know Brayden? Do you know Brayden? Is your kid less active than Brayden?

25:28.000 --> 25:34.400
Then have I got an au pair for you? Wait, are there two of you? Why did you emphasize pair?

25:34.400 --> 25:39.200
It'll seem like that. That's how good I am at it. You'll wonder if there's an au pair of me.

25:39.200 --> 25:44.560
That man is sitting and playing video games on his couch so good. It looks like there's two of him.

25:45.120 --> 25:50.800
That guy's, that, that man is watching TV with kids and actually secretly scrolling pornography

25:50.800 --> 25:56.000
on his phone. Justin. He's the worst in a lot of ways. He's super bad. Wait a minute.

25:56.000 --> 26:01.520
Is there one or two of him? He sucks so much. There's only one cause he's terrible. This

26:01.520 --> 26:09.040
shithead is so shitty. I'm seeing double vision. This kind of incompetence can't be contained in

26:09.040 --> 26:29.040
one corporeal form. You'll say to yourself. I want to tell you all about BlueApron.com.

26:29.040 --> 26:36.000
Blue Apron is like one of, uh, it has literally changed my life. And I, I say that you're going

26:36.000 --> 26:40.960
to sound like I'm blowing, uh, blowing smoke, but, uh, Blue Apron is a service where you sign

26:40.960 --> 26:46.880
up and every week they'll send you meals in the mail. All the ingredients you'll need to make a

26:46.880 --> 26:51.360
meal, I should say, because it's not done for you. You've got to meet them halfway on this. They'll,

26:51.360 --> 26:57.600
uh, send you fresh, delicious meals that are easy to make for $9.99 a meal. It's a

26:57.600 --> 27:02.560
refrigerated box, uh, with, with the meat, the spices, the vegetables, everything you'll need.

27:02.560 --> 27:08.240
Uh, and it's a different thing every time. The reason I say it's changed my life is they, uh,

27:08.240 --> 27:14.240
there are well balanced meals. Um, and, and I, and that's always the part for me at dinnertime

27:14.240 --> 27:18.240
is figuring out like, you know, you're tired. You don't want to put the time into like driving to

27:18.240 --> 27:22.640
the store and all that stuff. So you get a pizza, you get something unhealthy with Blue Apron. It's

27:22.640 --> 27:27.920
settled for you. You know what you have to do and it's all there ready for you to start, uh, digging

27:27.920 --> 27:33.600
into. So it's a, like a really great, healthy option. Most meals are only 500 to 700 calories

27:33.600 --> 27:38.720
per serving. We're talking about stuff like, uh, let's see, what did I have? Uh, this week I got

27:38.720 --> 27:45.920
lamb shawarma. Yeah. Yeah. That sounds awesome. Oh, we did that too. Can I dip into that? Uh, last,

27:45.920 --> 27:53.680
uh, last week I had some, uh, uh, uh, beef low main in like an orange sauce with guy land on it.

27:53.680 --> 27:58.320
And I actually get a lot of vegetables in the blue apron box that I could not buy locally.

27:58.320 --> 28:01.360
I mean, and that's the cool thing is not only are you getting the main dish,

28:01.360 --> 28:05.920
but it also includes a side dish as well. So with the shawarma, there was a radish salad

28:05.920 --> 28:11.840
and like we did, uh, we did crispy chicken thighs and like a whole separate other side dish. And

28:11.840 --> 28:17.760
it was ridiculous how good it was. Like if it's so much food and it's only 9.99 per meal. So if

28:17.760 --> 28:21.360
you want to try it, you're going to go to blue apron.com slash my brother, and you can get two

28:21.360 --> 28:28.320
meals for free by going to blue apron.com slash my brother, that address one more time, blue

28:28.320 --> 28:34.480
apron.com slash my brother. Um, here's the thing guys, when you're not eating delicious food from

28:34.480 --> 28:39.760
blue apron, you're going to be wearing underwear. Sometimes those may even cross over. It's

28:39.760 --> 28:46.880
impossible. No, I cook bottomless because I like to feel the air on me while I'm expressing myself

28:46.880 --> 28:53.760
colonarily. And I'm saying this and I'm thinking about like grease splatter and I'm uncomfortable.

28:53.760 --> 28:58.000
That's why you have to wear one of those big, like Irish thick mitt sweaters cable. So it hangs

28:58.000 --> 29:04.320
down to like your knees. And that's a sexy look for a boy. Yeah. Um, I want to tell you guys about

29:04.320 --> 29:09.360
the best underwear you can buy. And that is of course me undies. Uh, me undies is the most

29:09.360 --> 29:15.200
comfortable underwear that exists in the world. Uh, they're dedicated to offering you, uh, comfy

29:15.200 --> 29:20.640
undies that fit great. They don't ride up and they actually pull moisture away from your skin. So

29:20.640 --> 29:26.240
you're cool all day long. Uh, I wore them almost exclusively down in Nolans and that swamp water

29:26.240 --> 29:32.800
didn't get anywhere near my zone. Stay out of there swamp water. I have a certain barometric

29:32.800 --> 29:38.240
level. I prefer to keep things down there and me undies got me. Um, they're environmentally friendly.

29:38.240 --> 29:43.520
They have cool styles for both men and women. They look great. Go to me undies.com and you can look

29:43.520 --> 29:47.680
at pictures of people wearing underwear and they look great. And the underwear looks great and you

29:47.680 --> 29:52.560

order and free shipping on that order. No kidding is the best underwear that exists. Treat, treat

29:58.160 --> 30:04.080
yourself to it. Um, because you, you won't regret it. We have a message for Lydia syphilis Diller

30:04.080 --> 30:10.560
Carlton. Oh Jesus. Okay. And it's from Edwin. I feel like you didn't nail the emphasis there.

30:10.560 --> 30:18.080
Let me try Lydia syphilis Diller. No, no, no, no. Lydia syphilis Diller. Oh, okay. I see. There you

30:18.080 --> 30:25.520
go. Uh, Carlton, uh, from Edwin double-fist Zuniga. Yeah, probably nailed it. Happy birthday to the

30:25.520 --> 30:30.560
truest friend, a long haired kid from the streets of LA could have. Sorry the end of 2014 sucked,

30:30.560 --> 30:37.440
but together we'll avoid le bonking it in 2015. Looking forward to fire pits, dice rolling,

30:37.440 --> 30:43.120
pasta necklaces, judging young kids at the rock and roll shows and slapping fugazi songs on my

30:43.120 --> 30:49.280
belly in the years to come. Keep it streets, LC. Wow. Sometimes I just feel like I have this open

30:49.280 --> 30:53.600
wind. Like it's almost like you're driving past and you stare in people's windows and you think

30:53.600 --> 30:57.840
like, I saw something I'm not meant to see. Yeah. Driving past, not like looking in for a long

30:57.840 --> 31:03.760
period of time. Oh wait, hold on. Let me listen to that belly slap. Is that fugazi? Is that fugazi

31:03.760 --> 31:08.160
or is that pavement? I can't. Some people will say that the only way to listen to music is on vinyl,

31:08.160 --> 31:12.960
but I think the only way to listen to music is on belly slap. I actually, I like to take two

31:12.960 --> 31:18.960
seven inch LPs and I use those as circular drumsticks against my belly fat. I do it against

31:18.960 --> 31:24.240
other people no matter how much they ask me to stop. Got a message for Charles R. This is a

31:24.240 --> 31:35.600
fucking name. Charles R. Mountain from Caitlin says, happy birthday, Chip. Sorry, Caitlin. Do you

31:35.600 --> 31:42.480
mean Charles R. Mountain? We'll accept Chuck Mountain and also the mountain and that's it.

31:42.480 --> 31:46.240
That's it. I know you thought your birthday present would be a personal message for the

31:46.240 --> 31:50.560
McElroy brothers, but that wouldn't be a surprise at all. Instead, I got you a large frame photo of

31:50.560 --> 31:55.760
Orb winning the Kentucky Derby. To redeem, mention coupon code, Orb is two steel drums.

31:57.040 --> 32:04.960
He is. He really is. He is. Well, happy birthday, The Mountain or Charles or Chuck Mountain.

32:04.960 --> 32:09.200
I don't think there's any gift that anybody could give you that's better than if your parents

32:09.200 --> 32:15.600
already gave. Enjoy walking the land and spreading the good word. Mastering all you survey, Chuck

32:15.600 --> 32:26.080
Mountain. Hi, I'm Julie Sabatier, host of Rendered. It's a show about making meaning and breaking

32:26.080 --> 32:31.920
rules. We're answering important questions like, can you build a space suit in your living room?

32:31.920 --> 32:36.240
I went to my brother's place in Beaverton and he has a swimming pool and I pressurized the suit and

32:36.240 --> 32:39.920
sat down there underwater for about 10 minutes. The thing that I built was supporting my life.

32:39.920 --> 32:45.280
That felt really good. What does it sound like when you play a polka record through a styrofoam

32:45.280 --> 32:55.280
cup? And what happens when an airport carpet gains a cult following? Oh my goodness,

32:56.000 --> 33:01.920
the carpet has an Instagram. Check out Rendered now at maximumfun.org or wherever you like to

33:01.920 --> 33:09.760
listen to podcasts. Do you guys want a Yahoo? Yes. Yeah, please. This one was sent in by

33:09.760 --> 33:17.920
game recognized game, Rachel Sperling. Thank you, Rachel. What was that? That was just the drum beat

33:17.920 --> 33:22.400
of like when a basketball team enters. I was hoping somebody would do like the synthesizer

33:22.400 --> 33:28.560
and which name name me three basketball teams. It's not the LA Lakers, the Wizards, the Bulls

33:28.560 --> 33:34.080
and the Spurs. OK, someone knows their shit. This anonymous user asked this question in the

33:34.080 --> 33:42.320
pregnancy and parenting trying to conceive category. Would your semen be able to leave the moon

33:42.960 --> 33:51.920
if you ejaculated while standing on the moon? Oh, God, sorry, showing up on the radar,

33:51.920 --> 33:55.600
it's coming hard and fast and it's not breaking up in the atmosphere. Armageddon,

33:55.600 --> 34:02.640
too. We got to stop this jizz. I don't want to close my eyes, but I probably should.

34:02.640 --> 34:11.440
I should because this sucks. Would your semen? You're on the moon. You blast off some dude juice

34:11.440 --> 34:19.520
and it whoosh. I think you've created a new astral body. It would enter like it would become

34:19.520 --> 34:24.000
a moon to the moon, wouldn't it? At that point, like it would enter. It would have its own orbit.

34:24.000 --> 34:30.560
Yeah. Uh-huh. The tiniest comet. A little comet. It comes around every 70 years and your kids

34:30.560 --> 34:37.360
look up their future telescopes and say, Dad, is that Hale-Bopp Comet 2? And you say, Yeah,

34:37.360 --> 34:43.440
it is. And I have a secret I've never told anyone as much is. I guess the real question in this

34:43.440 --> 34:48.240
scenario is like how what mechanism did you come up with to have your wiener out that it didn't

34:48.240 --> 34:58.240
freeze off in the void of space? A mitten. Put a mitten over that. Of course. I don't see what's

34:58.240 --> 35:07.600
so hard to understand about that. Whoosh. There it goes. Got you, little guy. It can fly. It'll

35:07.600 --> 35:14.800
take trillions of years as it travels out of our solar system, goes through the interstellar black

35:14.800 --> 35:20.000
hole, comes out the other end. It's trillions of light years away from our Earth as we know it.

35:20.000 --> 35:28.640
And then to a derelict part of space where it's just no life has formed. And then my dew juice

35:28.640 --> 35:35.440
explodes. What if that becomes the sun? Oh, my God. And that's the newest game from me, Peter

35:35.440 --> 35:44.320
Molyneux. That is how this is the opening moments. And then from that point, you take one ounce of

35:44.320 --> 35:53.760
the dew juice to portray, to go to every corner of the solar system. And this is the game that

35:53.760 --> 36:00.080
I've made for you, Peter Molyneux. It has the most upsetting Kinect controls that you've ever-

36:00.080 --> 36:07.760
You will never be more upset by Kinect controls. Graphical fidelity so rich you'll wish it wasn't.

36:08.640 --> 36:13.360
And there it goes off on its own adventure. I'm just thinking about the departure.

36:13.360 --> 36:14.080
Mm-hmm.

36:14.080 --> 36:20.080
And just one astronaut watching another one. And it's like, this isn't weird. This is science.

36:20.080 --> 36:22.080
I see you've come control to me, Tom. Please stop.

36:22.080 --> 36:31.760
And then it's like, whoosh. My own little spaceship of my own going on an interstellar journey.

36:33.040 --> 36:41.520
And there it goes, saluted as it escapes the orbit. Whoosh. But then it runs into an

36:41.520 --> 36:46.080
astronaut. And then it sticks to all the astronauts together.

36:46.080 --> 36:48.560
I don't know why the scientists keep making astronauts.

36:48.560 --> 36:55.200
All the astronauts get stuck together. And then it alters the orbit of this new planet you've

36:55.200 --> 37:02.560
created. And it crashes into our planet. And that's Melancholia II. Lars von Trier. He's

37:02.560 --> 37:07.760
mixing all of his genres together. It's a spatial sex horror romp.

37:07.760 --> 37:15.040
And I call it Ghostbusters III. You're right, everybody. I just made it very bad. Made a bad

37:15.040 --> 37:19.280
film. That's me. Lars von Trier.

37:19.280 --> 37:21.600
That's right. Ghostbusters III.

37:21.600 --> 37:27.680
And that's what I sound like. The classic my brother, my brother, and me bit. What does

37:27.680 --> 37:34.960
Justin think people sound like? Hi, I'm Lars von Trier. This is me. Did you guys see Antichrist?

37:34.960 --> 37:41.040
Pretty fucked up, huh? You may remember the way my voice sounds from the time that I tried

37:41.040 --> 37:46.480
to sound like Peter Molyneux ten minutes ago. Oh, Jesus.

37:46.480 --> 37:50.960
I fall asleep without trouble, only to be slowly woken up by a song, usually at about

37:50.960 --> 37:57.680
four a.m. Today, it's Starship. This happens almost every night. I've tried putting on

37:57.680 --> 38:02.320
ambient music or white noise, but it only makes Mbop even louder. Do you have any ideas

38:02.320 --> 38:06.960
about what I can do? Save me. We built this city from this terrible. We built the city

38:06.960 --> 38:12.400
on rock and roll waking nightmare. Sleepless in Portland, not Seattle. I'm confused.

38:12.400 --> 38:15.040
Yeah, me too. Where's the music coming from?

38:15.040 --> 38:16.640
No, I don't understand.

38:17.680 --> 38:21.280
You find the source of the music and you ask them to shut it down. Like, I don't understand.

38:21.280 --> 38:23.680
No, it's in your head. Or is it in your head?

38:23.680 --> 38:27.200
That's the thing. What they're saying is they have a song stuck in their head. So this happened

38:27.200 --> 38:33.840
to me with Bastille's Pompeii for literally three weeks, where I would be woken up from

38:33.840 --> 38:38.080
a dead sleep with badadum badum in my head.

38:38.080 --> 38:39.360
You're talking about Tarzan Boy 2.

38:40.000 --> 38:41.120
It was so catchy.

38:42.080 --> 38:48.000
Yeah, I got Pompeii in my head really bad. I think everyone on this call will remember

38:48.000 --> 38:56.800
the grim few days in February of 2015, where we were all in confined spaces for a weekend.

38:56.800 --> 39:05.360
And I had not even the chorus of Ginuwine's Pony stuck in my head, but just the very beginning

39:05.360 --> 39:06.160
sounds.

39:06.160 --> 39:07.920
The opening strains.

39:07.920 --> 39:12.000
The opening strains of Pony.

39:12.000 --> 39:18.160
I actually looked up the lyrics later and was retroactively horrified by what I'd been...

39:18.160 --> 39:22.640
So this is a great opportunity for us to talk about the lyrics of Pony in a frank and safe

39:22.640 --> 39:23.200
environment.

39:24.320 --> 39:25.360
Because this is a fun game.

39:25.360 --> 39:28.720
If you're listening at home, you've certainly heard the song Pony millions and millions

39:28.720 --> 39:29.440
of times.

39:29.440 --> 39:31.040
Go ahead and say the first few words of the chorus.

39:31.040 --> 39:32.560
They reference it on Parks and Rec.

39:32.560 --> 39:33.600
He sings it at Lilith's...

39:33.600 --> 39:35.040
I played it at my wedding.

39:35.040 --> 39:37.760
I played it at my wedding, and I danced with my nanny to it.

39:37.760 --> 39:38.960
But go ahead and try and figure out the first words.

39:38.960 --> 39:41.600
So let's just go ahead and talk about this.

39:41.600 --> 39:43.200
By the way, this is the rest of the show.

39:43.200 --> 39:48.880
So if you don't want to spoil Ginuwine's Pony for yourself, then you want to skip ahead

39:48.880 --> 39:49.680
to the end.

39:49.680 --> 39:50.560
Here are...

39:50.560 --> 39:51.120
Let's just go line by line.

39:51.120 --> 39:53.520
If you have a song stuck in your head, by the way, just try and get it out.

39:53.520 --> 39:54.080
Get over it.

39:54.080 --> 39:54.400
Go on.

39:54.400 --> 39:55.600
Okay, deuce.

39:55.600 --> 39:56.560
Listen to the song.

39:56.560 --> 39:58.000
Actually, listen to the song.

39:58.000 --> 39:59.040
That's what did it for me.

39:59.840 --> 40:00.560
You have to listen...

40:00.560 --> 40:04.000
Because if you get halfway through something, that's when it gets stuck.

40:04.000 --> 40:05.520
So you have to like finish it.

40:05.520 --> 40:08.000
And then stop listening to it instead of midstream.

40:08.000 --> 40:11.040
Because your brain gets hung up on things that are unfinished.

40:11.920 --> 40:13.040
And it wants to complete the loop.

40:13.040 --> 40:14.880
There's a lot of game design based around that.

40:14.880 --> 40:17.120
Anyway, I'm just a bachelor.

40:17.120 --> 40:17.760
Okay.

40:17.760 --> 40:19.200
Looking for a partner.

40:19.200 --> 40:19.760
Beautiful.

40:19.760 --> 40:20.800
I'm loving it so far.

40:20.800 --> 40:22.160
This is very romantic.

40:22.160 --> 40:22.400
Yeah.

40:22.400 --> 40:23.680
So far, this is good.

40:23.680 --> 40:26.960
Someone who knows how to ride without even falling off.

40:26.960 --> 40:28.800
Maybe he literally needs horseback riding.

40:28.800 --> 40:29.360
Hold on.

40:30.240 --> 40:35.680
Are you having a problem with people falling off of your pee pee during sex?

40:35.680 --> 40:37.440
She's really bad at riding.

40:37.440 --> 40:39.120
She keeps injuring herself.

40:39.120 --> 40:40.560
Are you bucking down there?

40:40.560 --> 40:41.280
What are you doing?

40:42.320 --> 40:42.640
It's so rambunctious.

40:42.640 --> 40:43.840
I'm very slippery.

40:44.960 --> 40:46.000
I'm very slippery.

40:46.720 --> 40:49.440
I'm not a sex time, like, master.

40:50.160 --> 40:52.320
But you don't buck.

40:52.320 --> 40:53.360
I don't buck.

40:53.360 --> 40:53.760
Nobody falls.

40:54.400 --> 40:55.520
Gotta be compatible.

40:56.080 --> 40:57.360
Takes me to my limits.

40:58.160 --> 41:02.080
Girl, when I break you off, I promise that you won't want to get off.

41:02.080 --> 41:02.480
All right?

41:02.480 --> 41:04.160
You're starting to confuse some of your...

41:05.200 --> 41:05.680
Okay.

41:05.680 --> 41:06.400
But then he...

41:06.400 --> 41:10.480
Just before you can like contemplate that line, he gets...

41:10.480 --> 41:16.000
Like, in case you've been somehow confused by the layers of illusion.

41:16.000 --> 41:18.640
Is it horses or is it fucking?

41:18.640 --> 41:18.960
Right.

41:18.960 --> 41:20.880
Is it horses or is it fucking?

41:20.880 --> 41:26.800
Genuine dispels any of that lingering doubt by saying,

41:26.800 --> 41:28.960
if you're horny, let's do it.

41:30.000 --> 41:31.920
Ride it, my pony.

41:32.480 --> 41:35.520
But he could be being very obtuse there.

41:35.520 --> 41:41.280
And he could be just speaking politically if you're super horny to ride a horse.

41:41.920 --> 41:43.200
I mean, because that's me.

41:43.200 --> 41:45.600
Like, basically every day I'm super horny to ride a horse.

41:45.600 --> 41:51.440
Give me more general parlance, not the specific, not the literal horny,

41:51.440 --> 41:53.760
but the new vernacular horny.

41:53.760 --> 41:55.840
Like, I'm really horny to try this burger.

41:55.840 --> 41:56.720
Yeah, I'm horny.

41:56.720 --> 41:58.160
I don't want to fuck this burger.

41:58.160 --> 41:58.480
Right.

41:58.480 --> 41:59.920
No one would want to fuck a burger.

42:00.560 --> 42:01.520
But I will.

42:01.520 --> 42:02.640
I will if you need me to.

42:02.640 --> 42:03.520
If I have to.

42:03.520 --> 42:05.520
If it's going to get me this job, yeah, sure.

42:06.880 --> 42:08.080
Listen, I'm going to be devil's advocate here because-

42:08.080 --> 42:10.000
That's what it's going to take to sell you this car.

42:10.000 --> 42:13.440
I'm going to be devil's advocate here because I feel like people have over-sexed this song

42:13.440 --> 42:18.160
way too much, and I am still unconvinced it's not about horsies.

42:18.160 --> 42:25.120
What a pretty fun interpretation of this song is that Genuine has never had sex in his life

42:25.840 --> 42:28.640
and doesn't know the things that happen in it.

42:28.640 --> 42:31.760
So he imagines that maybe falling off is a problem,

42:31.760 --> 42:35.200
or maybe someone gets broken off at a certain point.

42:35.200 --> 42:38.480
Or like if it's not compatible because like yours is kind of shaped like this

42:38.480 --> 42:39.920
and hers is kind of shaped like that.

42:39.920 --> 42:40.960
It's like, well, I'm not going to fit in there.

42:40.960 --> 42:42.560
Some people have a duck penis.

42:42.560 --> 42:43.520
I don't know.

42:44.240 --> 42:45.840
What do you say before you do it?

42:45.840 --> 42:50.720
Probably something like really direct, like if you're horny, let's do it.

42:50.720 --> 42:53.360
Do you think that's how people have sex together?

42:53.360 --> 42:54.320
Like they say that?

42:54.320 --> 42:58.160
I can't think of literally any other introduction to the act.

42:58.160 --> 42:58.400
Yeah.

42:58.400 --> 43:00.480
Then I'm going to kiss your butt.

43:00.480 --> 43:01.920
You're going to kiss my butt?

43:03.120 --> 43:03.760
Because that's-

43:03.760 --> 43:04.400
Is that what you-

43:05.520 --> 43:07.280
Gonna pinch your elbows now.

43:08.160 --> 43:12.000
I don't think, and then he thinks saddles are involved.

43:12.000 --> 43:13.120
My saddle's waiting.

43:13.680 --> 43:14.560
Come and jump on it.

43:14.560 --> 43:19.760
Now here's where I think my theory is reinforced.

43:19.760 --> 43:23.360
In the next section of Genuine's Pony,

43:23.360 --> 43:29.600
he has completely exhausted any like imagined sexual prowess that he has

43:29.600 --> 43:30.720
and says the lines,

43:31.600 --> 43:32.880
sitting here flossing,

43:34.160 --> 43:36.400
peeping your stelo.

43:37.920 --> 43:39.440
He's sitting here flossing.

43:39.440 --> 43:39.600
Yeah.

43:39.600 --> 43:42.000
He knows about oral hygiene.

43:42.000 --> 43:43.680
He's got a fucking amazing smile.

43:43.680 --> 43:45.280
So I'm not so surprised about that.

43:45.840 --> 43:47.520
Peeping your steelix.

43:47.520 --> 43:49.360
He's looking over their Pokemon collection.

43:49.360 --> 43:51.520
So like, yes, again, I'm on board.

43:51.520 --> 43:56.640
Is it possible he's so deep into Pony play that when he says like,

43:56.640 --> 44:01.680
you're falling off and like my saddle is ready, he's being literal.

44:01.680 --> 44:06.960
Like if you want to do this, put a saddle on me, ride me around the apartment.

44:06.960 --> 44:08.720
Do a horsey back ride.

44:08.720 --> 44:11.120
And then nine months later, you'll poop a baby out of your butt.

44:11.120 --> 44:11.840
I think.

44:11.840 --> 44:12.080
Yeah.

44:13.280 --> 44:13.680
Maybe.

44:14.320 --> 44:15.840
There's some more vague,

44:16.720 --> 44:18.960
vague allusions to the sex act,

44:20.000 --> 44:22.960
culminating in chills up and down your spine,

44:23.520 --> 44:25.120
juices flowing down your thigh,

44:25.120 --> 44:26.880
which I think we can all agree.

44:26.880 --> 44:28.720
It's sweat from the saddle.

44:30.320 --> 44:32.400
I got the sweaty thighs from this saddle.

44:32.400 --> 44:35.760
I need a bigger saddle that it has that it breathes.

44:35.760 --> 44:39.920
So here is the next, the last section of this song.

44:39.920 --> 44:41.040
And he starts,

44:41.920 --> 44:46.160
he grabs the reins of this fucking crazy metaphor

44:46.160 --> 44:48.560
and just steers it into a shopping mall.

44:48.560 --> 44:51.760
And it's just like knocking over trash cans.

44:51.760 --> 44:53.120
Cannot keep it on the rails.

44:53.120 --> 44:54.480
Here are the last lines of the song.

44:54.480 --> 44:57.680
If we're going to get nasty, baby, first we'll show and tell.

44:57.680 --> 44:57.920
Okay.

44:57.920 --> 45:03.040
So metaphorically, what you've done is you've taken us into a classroom

45:03.040 --> 45:06.240
where we're going to show and tell about the things

45:06.240 --> 45:07.200
that we're about to do.

45:07.200 --> 45:08.320
And what are those things?

45:08.320 --> 45:10.400
Show our genitals and tell about them?

45:10.400 --> 45:11.360
Tell about our genitals.

45:11.360 --> 45:12.400
This is my penis.

45:12.400 --> 45:13.840
His name is Steve.

45:13.840 --> 45:14.800
This is penis.

45:15.680 --> 45:16.320
What is this?

45:17.280 --> 45:17.760
Tell me.

45:17.760 --> 45:19.120
What do you call this?

45:19.120 --> 45:21.040
Till I reach your ponytail.

45:21.040 --> 45:21.280
Okay.

45:21.280 --> 45:26.480
So now you've like conflated ponytails with ponytails

45:26.480 --> 45:27.680
and maybe another,

45:27.680 --> 45:30.160
and there's definitely like an animalia layer.

45:30.160 --> 45:32.080
He might actually mean like a ponytail butt plug

45:32.080 --> 45:33.280
from Extreme Restraints.

45:33.280 --> 45:38.800
Or he thinks that he's going to go so deep in that vagina,

45:39.600 --> 45:42.720
he's going to reach her butt again,

45:43.600 --> 45:47.520
proving that I don't think he understands what's up down there.

45:47.520 --> 45:50.800
Is that Genuine's hand coming out from underneath your ponytail?

45:50.800 --> 45:52.720
Like that one scene in The Grudge?

45:52.720 --> 45:53.920
Yes, it is.

45:53.920 --> 45:55.040
He's deep inside.

45:56.240 --> 46:00.560
He then says, lurk all over and through you, baby.

46:00.560 --> 46:03.440
He's going to go on a magic school bus adventure

46:03.440 --> 46:06.560
through your vagina tube until he takes the butt exit.

46:07.920 --> 46:08.720
He's going to lurk.

46:08.720 --> 46:10.240
But he says he'll lurk.

46:10.240 --> 46:12.080
How are you going to lurk through someone?

46:12.080 --> 46:12.960
What's wrong?

46:12.960 --> 46:13.520
What's wrong?

46:13.520 --> 46:15.040
You seem distressed.

46:15.040 --> 46:16.800
Yeah, my stomach is really hurting.

46:16.800 --> 46:19.280
It might be I had some Mediterranean food

46:19.280 --> 46:20.800
and I don't usually handle that well,

46:20.800 --> 46:24.400
or possibly Genuine's on a magic school bus adventure inside.

46:24.400 --> 46:26.320
And he's lurking around my insides.

46:26.320 --> 46:29.280
Lurking around all over and through me.

46:29.280 --> 46:30.640
And then he gets that,

46:30.640 --> 46:34.240
like he tries to bring the metaphor back around.

46:34.240 --> 46:36.720
He says, until I reach your stream,

46:38.880 --> 46:40.800
you'll be on my jockey team.

46:40.800 --> 46:41.280
Sure.

46:41.280 --> 46:43.680
What are you even saying?

46:43.680 --> 46:46.240
Like I don't even understand metaphorically

46:46.240 --> 46:48.640
what you're trying to get across anymore.

46:48.640 --> 46:50.480
The stream is a metaphor for the fact

46:50.480 --> 46:52.400
that he can lead her to his penis,

46:52.400 --> 46:53.920
but can't make her drink.

46:53.920 --> 46:56.400
And then the jockey team,

46:56.400 --> 47:01.360
she's going to be on the team of people riding him.

47:01.360 --> 47:02.560
Apparently?

47:02.560 --> 47:03.840
For competition.

47:04.480 --> 47:06.800
He is not making her feel special.

47:07.360 --> 47:09.120
Maybe he says jockey team

47:09.120 --> 47:12.400
because he feels like he had to rhyme with stream.

47:12.400 --> 47:14.480
But honestly, Genuine, that's a restriction.

47:14.480 --> 47:16.160
That's a self-made prison, man.

47:16.160 --> 47:17.440
Yeah, look around.

47:17.440 --> 47:19.040
That's a prison you made for yourself.

47:19.040 --> 47:21.200
Stream didn't make any sense in context.

47:21.200 --> 47:23.520
You've had no water-related-

47:23.520 --> 47:25.680
Again, Genuine, you did say earlier

47:25.680 --> 47:28.080
that she was the one with a ponytail.

47:28.080 --> 47:29.840
And if that's the case, she's a pony

47:29.840 --> 47:33.360
and ponies don't ride other fucking ponies on races and shit.

47:33.360 --> 47:34.400
How about this line?

47:34.400 --> 47:36.640
I don't want you to think I'm a player.

47:36.640 --> 47:38.960
I'm going to make you my only mare.

47:39.520 --> 47:40.400
That's beautiful.

47:40.400 --> 47:40.880
That's fine.

47:40.880 --> 47:42.960
But then you have just confessed

47:42.960 --> 47:45.360
that you have a team of people

47:45.360 --> 47:47.600
that are unsuccessfully riding on you

47:47.600 --> 47:49.440
because you won't stop fucking bucking them off.

47:50.320 --> 47:52.000
You have to have some backups

47:52.000 --> 47:53.680
because that's how he thinks sex works.

47:53.680 --> 47:55.440
Well, what he's saying is

47:55.440 --> 47:58.400
she's going to have to work his way up the jockey team

47:58.400 --> 48:00.160
because you don't just start the jockey off

48:00.160 --> 48:00.560
in first position.

48:00.560 --> 48:02.480
You get in on the ground floor.

48:03.760 --> 48:06.080
Yeah, I'm going to welcome you to the line

48:06.080 --> 48:07.840
and if you can prove that you're better

48:07.840 --> 48:12.160
than Jimmy and Steve and Susan and little Jimmy,

48:12.160 --> 48:14.640
then you can be the head of the jockey team.

48:15.600 --> 48:19.840
But until then, if you're horny, let's do it.

48:19.840 --> 48:22.480
You got to muck my stable, if you know what I mean.

48:22.480 --> 48:23.360
If you know what I'm saying.

48:23.360 --> 48:25.520
I wish he threw out more metaphor.

48:25.520 --> 48:27.920
Oh, there's so many things that he could do.

48:27.920 --> 48:29.040
I'll let you shoo me.

48:29.680 --> 48:30.000
What?

48:30.000 --> 48:30.240
Yeah.

48:31.040 --> 48:32.240
What does that mean?

48:32.240 --> 48:37.360
Inspectum, my teeth girl, looking for gum health.

48:37.360 --> 48:39.760
It'll be there because I floss awesome.

48:42.640 --> 48:47.920
An apple, two apples, third apple, I'll eat them.

48:47.920 --> 48:50.400
I'm pulling your carriage.

48:50.400 --> 48:56.160
I pooped on the street and the Shriners rode through it.

48:57.680 --> 48:59.920
He's in a parade in this metaphor.

48:59.920 --> 49:01.760
Sure, I'm with you.

49:03.520 --> 49:05.040
Wow, that really was the rest of the show.

49:05.760 --> 49:07.920
I told you, I knew, I sensed it.

49:07.920 --> 49:08.800
I sensed it coming.

49:08.800 --> 49:13.040
Thank you so much to MeUndies for sponsoring our program.

49:13.040 --> 49:16.240

49:24.160 --> 49:26.320
The other one is Blue Apron.

49:26.320 --> 49:30.080
Blue Apron, you can go there and you can get delicious

49:43.200 --> 49:44.800
Also, Max Fun Drive is coming up.

49:44.800 --> 49:48.560
It starts on the 16th and goes for two weeks.

49:48.560 --> 49:50.720
I mean, this will be our fourth, I think,

49:50.720 --> 49:52.880
but if you're new to the show or new to the network,

49:52.880 --> 49:55.520
Max Fun Drive is our opportunity to give you something

49:55.520 --> 49:57.120
like the best shows of the year.

50:00.720 --> 50:02.880
a donor of My Brother, My Brother and Me

50:02.880 --> 50:05.600

50:05.600 --> 50:08.000
And you'll get some great gifts for becoming a donor

50:08.000 --> 50:09.600
or upgrading your donation.

50:09.600 --> 50:14.160
You also get bonus episodes and I can only speak for

50:14.160 --> 50:15.840
My Brother, My Brother and Me in the Adventure Zone,

50:15.840 --> 50:17.120
but they're fucking good.

50:17.120 --> 50:18.320
You won't want to miss those.

50:18.320 --> 50:20.560
So, I mean, I don't know.

50:20.560 --> 50:22.080
I wasn't sitting in on the Sawbones

50:22.080 --> 50:23.520
or the Bunker Buddies bonus episodes.

50:23.520 --> 50:24.080
I don't know what kind of heat you guys are bringing.

50:24.080 --> 50:26.000
The Bunker Buddies one was super fun.

50:26.800 --> 50:27.520
How was Sawbones?

50:27.520 --> 50:29.920
I haven't done it, but will.

50:29.920 --> 50:30.560
It's gonna be good.

50:30.560 --> 50:31.600
It'll be real good.

50:31.600 --> 50:32.320
It's gonna be great.

50:33.200 --> 50:33.920
Also, I'm gonna let you know,

50:33.920 --> 50:35.200
there's a couple more tickets left.

50:35.200 --> 50:37.120
I think there's only a few for Milwaukee

50:37.120 --> 50:38.400
and a little bit more for Chicago,

50:38.400 --> 50:41.360
but they're going really, really quickly for our live show.

50:41.360 --> 50:45.920
So go to, it's bit.ly forward slash M-B-M-B-A-M Chicago.

50:45.920 --> 50:51.120
And the other one is bit.ly forward slash M-B-M-B-A-M-M-I-L.

50:51.120 --> 50:53.040
I want to thank John Roderick in the long winters

50:53.040 --> 50:54.080
for the use of our theme song,

50:54.080 --> 50:55.120
It's a Departure off the album,

50:55.120 --> 50:56.480
Putting the Days to Bed.

50:56.480 --> 50:57.280
A terrific album.

50:57.280 --> 50:58.960
I was actually listening to it this morning

50:58.960 --> 51:00.480
because it got a little chilly here in Austin.

51:00.480 --> 51:02.000
It's a nice cold weather buddy,

51:02.560 --> 51:03.920
but it's also a warm weather buddy.

51:05.360 --> 51:07.440
It's completely arbitrary what type of weather it is.

51:07.440 --> 51:08.880
Just buy the album and listen to it.

51:08.880 --> 51:09.440
It's great.

51:09.440 --> 51:12.800
I also want to say we got a, or I did at least,

51:12.800 --> 51:17.360
from Rob Toner in the LA PO Box.

51:17.920 --> 51:20.400
Rob sent me two Mordecai posters.

51:20.400 --> 51:21.200
Oh God.

51:21.200 --> 51:22.480
And they're the gigantic ones,

51:22.480 --> 51:25.120
the one of Johnny Depp and the one of Gwyneth Paltrow.

51:25.120 --> 51:26.800
Oh sure, yes, I know them well.

51:27.440 --> 51:28.960
Oh, they're so wonderful.

51:28.960 --> 51:30.240
I'm going to put them up in my home.

51:31.840 --> 51:34.640
The PO Box for the LA, the West Coast,

51:34.640 --> 51:40.240
is PO Box 341769, Los Angeles, California 90034.

51:40.240 --> 51:42.480
Speaking of, super quick,

51:42.480 --> 51:43.920
I want to just blow through these

51:43.920 --> 51:45.600
because I want to thank people

51:45.600 --> 51:48.400
for the great things they got us for Candlelightz.

51:48.400 --> 51:50.240
And I've had this stack of stuff next to my desk

51:50.240 --> 51:51.760
for literally three months.

51:51.760 --> 51:52.960
And so just let me say it.

51:53.760 --> 51:56.560
Andy sent me discs of all the Joystick podcasts.

51:56.560 --> 51:58.000
Thank you so much, Andy.

51:58.000 --> 52:00.880
Oz and Ben sent us a beautiful greeting card.

52:00.880 --> 52:03.280
We got one from Lead Beaters here.

52:03.280 --> 52:06.880
We got pickles from Scottsdale.

52:06.880 --> 52:09.040
Got a game of horse sense from Reed,

52:09.040 --> 52:10.320
a t-shirt and CD.

52:11.440 --> 52:14.560
Kate and Carl sticker factory.

52:14.560 --> 52:16.960
And Sean sleeps naked is the name of that CD.

52:17.840 --> 52:19.520
Andy got me Power Factory on CD.

52:20.960 --> 52:25.040
We got a beautiful postcard from Nauter Sessions.

52:25.680 --> 52:28.080
Scientists, those words don't make any sense.

52:28.080 --> 52:31.440
A postcard from Eric in California from Rome,

52:31.440 --> 52:32.480
which is beautiful.

52:32.480 --> 52:39.120
A postcard from Dennis R. from San Francisco.

52:39.120 --> 52:40.160
That's beautiful.

52:40.160 --> 52:44.720
A lovely Christmas card from Brian and Katherina.

52:44.720 --> 52:47.680
Another one from the Hills, which is just lovely.

52:47.680 --> 52:49.360
Everybody's got beautiful families.

52:49.360 --> 52:51.120
The Vandenbrooks sent us one.

52:51.120 --> 52:52.560
They have a beautiful family.

52:53.360 --> 52:54.560
I'm happy to report.

52:54.560 --> 52:56.560
Oh, I was worried.

52:56.560 --> 52:57.120
I know.

52:58.000 --> 53:00.560
Thank you, Brian, for the lovely note

53:00.560 --> 53:04.560
and the Adventure Zone gifts.

53:04.560 --> 53:09.120
Thank you to George Zimmerman for the very kind note.

53:09.120 --> 53:15.440
And congratulations to Talon Wisdom for graduating college.

53:15.440 --> 53:19.600
Thank you, Lindsay, for the beautiful gift

53:19.600 --> 53:21.920
that you sent to us.

53:21.920 --> 53:24.480
Jennifer and Laura, thank you for the wedding invite.

53:25.680 --> 53:28.800
Thank you to Nikita for the Jimmy Buffett book.

53:28.800 --> 53:32.160
Thank you to Save the Date from Rachel and Chris.

53:32.160 --> 53:33.520
That's very kind of you.

53:33.520 --> 53:38.720
We've got a beautiful postcard from India.

53:38.720 --> 53:40.880
Thanks to Anne for that.

53:41.680 --> 53:48.320
And finally, lastly, a dice bag from Trevor Dearborn

53:48.320 --> 53:50.480
that he fashioned for us himself.

53:50.480 --> 53:52.560
These chain link dice bags, I'll have to get you guys.

53:52.560 --> 53:53.360
Oh, sweet, yeah.

53:53.360 --> 53:55.680
So I know that was, sorry, everybody,

53:55.680 --> 53:57.440
but thank you to everyone who sent us stuff

53:57.440 --> 53:59.520
because it really is so very kind of you.

53:59.520 --> 54:00.960
Yeah, thank you all very much.

54:00.960 --> 54:05.120
Got a final Yahoo answer here from level 9,000.

54:05.120 --> 54:06.800
Yajuridru at Drew Davenport.

54:07.680 --> 54:08.560
Thank you, Drew.

54:09.280 --> 54:12.320
This is by a suspended Yahoo Answers user who asks,

54:13.600 --> 54:16.960
where and how can I get a life like Kesha's?

54:16.960 --> 54:18.240
I want a life like that.

54:20.240 --> 54:21.200
I'm Justin McElroy.

54:21.200 --> 54:22.320
I'm Charles McElroy.

54:22.320 --> 54:23.440
I'm Griffin McElroy.

54:23.440 --> 54:24.960
This has been My Brother, My Brother, Me.

54:24.960 --> 54:25.520
Kiss your dad.

54:25.520 --> 54:28.080
My Brother, My Brother, Me, Kiss Your Dad, school.

54:28.080 --> 54:28.880
Way on the lips.

54:46.160 --> 54:48.080
Maximumfun.org.

54:48.080 --> 54:49.120
Comedy and culture.

Artist-owned.

Oh, hey there, everybody.

54:54.000 --> 54:56.720
I'm Guy Branum, and welcome to Pop Rocket,

54:56.720 --> 54:58.960
a new weekly show picking over the pop culture

54:58.960 --> 55:00.640
we all love to love.

55:00.640 --> 55:02.800
With me to talk TV, film, music,

55:02.800 --> 55:04.320
and anything else entertaining

55:04.320 --> 55:06.160
are journalist Margaret Wappler,

55:06.160 --> 55:08.960
academic writer and DJ Oliver Wang,

55:08.960 --> 55:10.320
digital strategist Wyndham Mitchell,

55:10.320 --> 55:12.560
and comedian Santina Muha.

55:12.560 --> 55:14.880
It's an intellectual and incredibly snark-filled discussion

55:14.880 --> 55:18.080
about pop culture by five cranky Hollywood 30-somethings.

55:18.080 --> 55:19.440
No name-calling, no rudeness,

55:19.440 --> 55:21.040
just straight talk and a lot of role play.

55:21.040 --> 55:22.720
I'm only 30-something for another year.

55:22.720 --> 55:23.600
Me too.

55:23.600 --> 55:26.080
And I don't tell anybody I'm 30-something.

55:26.080 --> 55:52.960
Pop Rocket comes out every week from Maximumfun.org.
