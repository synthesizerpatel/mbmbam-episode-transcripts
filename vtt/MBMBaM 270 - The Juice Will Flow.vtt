00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:48.480
Welcome, my brother, my brother, mean advice show for the modern era.

00:49.280 --> 00:54.640
My name is Justin McElroy. I'm your oldest brother. My voice sounds like this today.

00:55.200 --> 00:58.000
My name is Travis McElroy, your middlest brother.

00:58.000 --> 01:03.200
And I'm Griffin. Guys, what the fuck even is going on anymore?

01:03.840 --> 01:08.560
It was a rough weekend. There was much ribaldry to be had.

01:08.560 --> 01:11.200
There was a lot, as they say, going on.

01:11.920 --> 01:13.440
There was a lot of folks.

01:14.320 --> 01:16.240
Turn my ceiling fan off. Forgot to turn that off,

01:16.240 --> 01:18.640
and there's a little bit of sound in the studio. Gonna be a rough one.

01:18.640 --> 01:20.640
I think that this one's gonna be a rough gem.

01:21.440 --> 01:26.320
No, I think there's gonna be some true diamonds to polish.

01:26.320 --> 01:29.040
This one's gonna be a jagged little pill.

01:29.040 --> 01:33.840
This is the diamond in the rough. We have located the diamond in the rough for you.

01:33.840 --> 01:38.720
Now the impetus is on you to detect its dimonosity.

01:38.720 --> 01:41.840
Count the carrots. Observe the purity.

01:41.840 --> 01:46.240
You must constantly recut it and recut it as it grows smaller and smaller,

01:46.240 --> 01:50.000
and yet you grow more and more unsatisfied with its perfection.

01:50.000 --> 01:58.800
Recut it with the diamond cutting tool of apology and also making excuses in your mind

01:58.800 --> 02:03.360
for our comedy and learn to appreciate this diamond in the rough.

02:03.360 --> 02:07.600
Because that's what growing up is. You're an adult now. Congratulations.

02:07.600 --> 02:09.040
That's what growing up is. Here's a certificate.

02:09.040 --> 02:12.880
Life is just a series of shittier and shittier diamonds.

02:13.760 --> 02:16.880
No, that's not what I'm saying. That's awful negative.

02:16.880 --> 02:22.880
I didn't get it. I didn't get the metaphor that you were crafting.

02:23.520 --> 02:28.160
I'm just saying this is an episode that only the true fans will appreciate.

02:28.160 --> 02:32.960
I think all of our last like six to seven episodes have been for true fans only.

02:32.960 --> 02:35.840
I feel like maybe we're becoming a little bit insular.

02:35.840 --> 02:39.680
I felt like our last six to seven episodes were for Trueblood fans only.

02:40.320 --> 02:42.720
Well, that's because we talked a lot about Trueblood, Travie.

02:42.720 --> 02:43.520
A lot about Trueblood.

02:43.520 --> 02:47.840
A lot about Trueblood. It was exclusionary. Guys.

02:47.840 --> 02:48.320
Yes?

02:48.320 --> 02:48.820
Yeah.

02:49.920 --> 02:51.360
This podcast is killing me.

02:55.360 --> 02:56.240
Let's drill down.

02:56.240 --> 03:02.880
I can't keep, I can't, the pace, the breakneck pace at which we are traveling and doing shit,

03:02.880 --> 03:04.800
doing other shit. It's like-

03:04.800 --> 03:10.320
The rockstar lifestyle of the, I remember reading about this in David Lee Roth's biography

03:10.320 --> 03:14.560
when he talked about how rough podcasting was on him.

03:14.560 --> 03:17.520
This episode, can we finally just cut the shit?

03:17.520 --> 03:18.640
Let's cut the bullshit.

03:18.640 --> 03:28.560
Can we cut the bullshit and just like talk to each other about how tired we are?

03:28.560 --> 03:32.000
We got a lot of irons in the fire and it's our fucking fault.

03:32.000 --> 03:35.280
We left those irons here like, I'll get it later, but now it's like,

03:35.280 --> 03:38.560
hey, you got until Monday to get all those fucking irons out and it's like,

03:38.560 --> 03:41.760
oh, but they're so hot and I left my iron gloves.

03:41.760 --> 03:45.760
We're being evicted from our blacksmith room.

03:45.760 --> 03:48.240
Yeah. I mean, whatever.

03:50.240 --> 03:56.400
I mean, fuck it, whatever. This is our welcome to the privilege hour.

03:56.400 --> 03:57.200
I love it.

03:57.200 --> 03:59.440
I'm so fucking beat, dog.

04:00.320 --> 04:01.920
I mean, it was a big ass weekend.

04:01.920 --> 04:07.920
And we're not, here's the thing though, like I think a lot of like, I think a lot of the

04:07.920 --> 04:15.680
mistakes that true entertainers, the real, you know, tears of a clown types to make is

04:15.680 --> 04:20.560
they go on stage and they try to do a great show and it's just not in them.

04:20.560 --> 04:24.960
And then people say they've lost it and it's like, well, that's hurtful.

04:24.960 --> 04:30.000
So what we're saying is we've lost it, but we'll get it back.

04:30.000 --> 04:34.480
We just want you to be invested in the journey with us.

04:34.480 --> 04:41.040
We're not going to lie to you and say, hey, this is like, you know, what best show,

04:41.040 --> 04:46.000
but maybe it might be, we make it up every week, every week.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.520
A man falls in a hole.

04:47.520 --> 04:48.400
You know what I mean?

04:48.400 --> 04:48.880
Yeah.

04:48.880 --> 04:52.800
And guys guy walks by and he's like, you're in a hole.

04:52.800 --> 04:55.200
Miners fall in the hole with him.

04:55.200 --> 04:59.200
And then there's, and then they find a TV down there and they just start like,

04:59.200 --> 05:02.720
hanging out for a while while they hide from their jobs.

05:02.720 --> 05:03.600
And it's pretty cool.

05:03.600 --> 05:05.360
This is our reboot of roundhouse.

05:05.360 --> 05:10.160
It's called ground hole and it's a kid's club, a subterranean kids club.

05:10.160 --> 05:11.200
Hey, that was pretty good.

05:11.200 --> 05:12.880
It's turning around already.

05:14.480 --> 05:20.000
I got home last night from the West coast.

05:20.000 --> 05:23.120
I woke up at 5 30 AM West coast time.

05:23.120 --> 05:32.000
Oh, then I went to sleep at 1 AM this time and then my baby woke up at 5 30 AM this time.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.520
Then I went back to sleep.

05:33.520 --> 05:36.320
I am doing jet lag the worst anyone has done it.

05:36.320 --> 05:39.600
I found a secret new jet lag inside jet lag.

05:39.600 --> 05:43.040
Justin, Justin somehow set his internal clock to like Korea.

05:44.320 --> 05:48.560
I woke up and I saw the leprechauns like dart back under like,

05:48.560 --> 05:50.160
there's no way he's awake right now.

05:50.160 --> 05:53.680
Now you know where all your shoes come from.

05:53.680 --> 05:56.720
Now you know where all your left socks have gone.

05:57.360 --> 05:58.160
They've been on.

05:58.160 --> 05:58.880
It's impossible.

05:58.880 --> 06:02.960
But like, I woke up and my stuffed animals were still like singing and talking and interacting.

06:04.560 --> 06:06.640
No, Justin, it's impossible.

06:06.640 --> 06:08.400
There's no way you're awake right now.

06:09.200 --> 06:10.240
What the fuck, dude?

06:13.040 --> 06:14.320
The teddy bear picnic.

06:15.120 --> 06:16.880
How could you witness the teddy bear picnic?

06:16.880 --> 06:18.240
There's no way you're awake.

06:18.240 --> 06:21.200
But like, come to think of it, I don't know when you would be asleep either.

06:21.200 --> 06:22.400
You're pretty fucked up right now.

06:22.400 --> 06:25.280
You didn't see the shit before the teddy bear picnic, right?

06:25.280 --> 06:26.960
Because that's when it was wrong.

06:26.960 --> 06:28.080
You just saw.

06:28.080 --> 06:31.200
I'll be honest, the teddy bear picnic is kind of a cool down.

06:33.680 --> 06:35.840
Teddy bear picnics like our chill out tent.

06:35.840 --> 06:39.360
And that's the day the teddy bears had their fuckfest.

06:40.240 --> 06:44.080
You didn't see our eyes wide shut homage, did you?

06:44.080 --> 06:46.080
Do you remember when I just yell saying,

06:46.080 --> 06:48.480
and that's the day the teddy bears had their fuckfest?

06:48.480 --> 06:54.080
Because that is the exact time that my mailman decided to drop off my mail right outside my office.

06:54.080 --> 06:57.680
We've got a complicated relationship, me and this dude.

07:00.800 --> 07:02.240
Let's do some questions though.

07:02.240 --> 07:03.200
He's a good man.

07:04.480 --> 07:06.400
Get that mail to you, rain or sun.

07:06.400 --> 07:12.720
Or someone yelling about teddy bear fuckfest, sleet or snow or horrifying imagery.

07:12.720 --> 07:14.320
The mailman just keeps chugging on.

07:14.320 --> 07:19.600
Look out on your lawn and see if he's just like seated out there with his head in his hands.

07:19.600 --> 07:20.880
He's calling his wife.

07:20.880 --> 07:22.320
No, this is my last day.

07:22.320 --> 07:22.960
You know what?

07:22.960 --> 07:24.240
I can't do this anymore.

07:24.240 --> 07:25.200
I'm out the game.

07:25.200 --> 07:26.000
Let me check real quick.

07:27.280 --> 07:28.080
Yeah, he's baiting.

07:30.480 --> 07:31.840
Your mailman's dirty.

07:31.840 --> 07:34.080
He's a dirty little postal boy.

07:34.080 --> 07:37.520
I travel for work a lot.

07:38.160 --> 07:42.560
Usually with one particularly clingy and incompetent colleague.

07:42.560 --> 07:44.320
I thought I was going to sing this whole question.

07:44.320 --> 07:46.160
I got five words in and bailed.

07:46.160 --> 07:49.760
I need a fair amount of alone time in order to function.

07:49.760 --> 07:53.520
And also I find her to be extremely annoying company.

07:53.520 --> 07:57.840
She's just the opposite and expects to eat every meal together.

07:57.840 --> 08:02.960
A few times I've gotten away from her for dinner, but the next day she complains about loneliness.

08:03.600 --> 08:07.760
How can I get more meals alone without alienating my colleague?

08:07.760 --> 08:10.640
That's from desperately seeking solitude.

08:10.640 --> 08:12.400
Fuck, that sucks.

08:13.280 --> 08:15.440
Damn, that's a hard question to start with.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.560
I might try to make a proposal.

08:20.000 --> 08:25.360
I propose that what you need to do is upon one of these forced dinners,

08:26.400 --> 08:31.360
you need to invent another friend who's very clingy and say,

08:31.360 --> 08:35.360
oh yes, I have this clingy friend, Susan.

08:35.360 --> 08:38.720
And she doesn't seem to understand that I need some alone time.

08:38.720 --> 08:39.840
You know what I mean?

08:39.840 --> 08:44.160
To function and oh, she's great and all, don't get me wrong.

08:44.160 --> 08:49.840
I like Susan, but sometimes you just need some time to recenter yourself

08:49.840 --> 08:54.160
and really think about now this may or may not solve the problem.

08:54.160 --> 08:57.760
Maybe your clingy work colleague gets the hint and goes like,

08:57.760 --> 09:00.000
oh, okay, I'm getting now that this is a person.

09:00.000 --> 09:05.280
But what it does provide you is in the future, if this person is clingy again,

09:05.280 --> 09:10.640
you're able to say like, you know, like I said, I just need a little alone time.

09:10.640 --> 09:14.000
And you've already, like in the past,

09:14.000 --> 09:17.120
brought up the subject makes it easier to bring up a second time.

09:17.680 --> 09:20.560
But what if you're like, what if like your friend's like,

09:20.560 --> 09:21.600
she sounds fun.

09:22.240 --> 09:23.120
What's her number?

09:23.120 --> 09:23.760
Give it to me.

09:23.760 --> 09:24.640
I'm going to hit her up.

09:25.200 --> 09:27.840
You can't, sorry, Justin, let me just step in here.

09:27.840 --> 09:30.800
You can't do an impression of any woman that sounds like that.

09:30.800 --> 09:32.080
You cannot do-

09:32.080 --> 09:34.880
That is the embodiment of the cartoon Cathy.

09:34.880 --> 09:37.200
Yeah, that's, you just did a Cathy, my dude.

09:38.160 --> 09:41.600
I mean, there's like, I love all people.

09:41.600 --> 09:41.840
Yeah.

09:42.480 --> 09:46.480
I give due respect to everyone regardless of-

09:46.480 --> 09:47.200
Didn't just-

09:47.200 --> 09:49.200
Like literally anything at this point.

09:49.200 --> 09:52.080
There are still Cathys in the world, Griffin.

09:52.080 --> 09:55.040
The earth still doth contain Cathys.

09:55.040 --> 10:01.920
I would give them the emotional right of way that I give to all peoples.

10:01.920 --> 10:04.960
They still exist and have voices.

10:04.960 --> 10:05.600
But I'm saying historically-

10:05.600 --> 10:07.920
I am giving voices to the Cathys.

10:07.920 --> 10:09.680
Why should you silence them?

10:09.680 --> 10:11.680
Do not silence the Cathys.

10:11.680 --> 10:15.120
But he who is without Cathys throws the first stone.

10:15.120 --> 10:19.040
Historically, that is a voice you do of a bad person.

10:19.040 --> 10:21.520
On the Justin McElroy voice-o-meter scale,

10:22.160 --> 10:25.280
it's when you do a good person, he sounds like you.

10:25.280 --> 10:27.760
But when you do a bad person, it sounds like Cathy.

10:27.760 --> 10:32.800
I'm just saying you have a confirmation, a Cathy confirmation bias.

10:32.800 --> 10:34.480
You're saying that I've got kind of a

10:34.480 --> 10:36.720
Jekyll and Hyde Justin and Cathy situation.

10:36.720 --> 10:38.880
You do, you do, you do.

10:38.880 --> 10:41.360
That is my favorite morning show, by the way.

10:41.360 --> 10:43.760
Yeah, Dr. Jekyll and Cathy.

10:43.760 --> 10:45.520
Listen, listen.

10:45.520 --> 10:52.640
Can you do anything to sort of sell the merits of loneliness chill out times?

10:52.640 --> 10:54.400
Maybe get her on geocaching.

10:54.400 --> 10:57.760
Well, I don't spend my lonely times geocaching, although I should.

10:57.760 --> 10:58.480
Oh, you don't?

10:58.480 --> 11:02.800
I should fill those hours with a little treasure hunts for spoons and whatnot, coupons.

11:04.320 --> 11:11.120
I have wondered my entire life who the fuck would eat at community tables at restaurants.

11:11.120 --> 11:14.000
I think I have just cracked the case.

11:14.000 --> 11:14.720
It's you.

11:15.680 --> 11:21.200
You have to find restaurants that have shared tables, family style dining,

11:21.200 --> 11:24.560
and then you are muting the blows.

11:24.560 --> 11:27.280
She can talk to other people there at the table.

11:27.280 --> 11:27.920
You know what I'm saying?

11:28.560 --> 11:30.720
You're refracting the attention.

11:30.720 --> 11:34.720
So strangers sitting at community tables at restaurants

11:35.280 --> 11:38.160
are just friends whose dinners you haven't ruined yet.

11:39.200 --> 11:39.920
With Cathy.

11:39.920 --> 11:43.280
With your fucking nonstop horseshit chatter.

11:43.280 --> 11:45.280
They're trying to enjoy their steak frites.

11:45.840 --> 11:48.880
Can I tell you guys what I actually do about the scenario in my real life?

11:48.880 --> 11:53.520
Uh, back when I used to be in a lot of different work environments,

11:54.640 --> 11:56.960
I would often have these situations.

11:56.960 --> 12:03.440
Uh, sometimes it was in a car traveling to news events with a person I found

12:03.440 --> 12:07.040
particularly distasteful or unpleasant to be around,

12:07.040 --> 12:12.640
but was not a malicious sort of person that did not deserve my, my scorn.

12:12.640 --> 12:19.280
What I would do is I would find a subject that this is, this is, I don't know if this is terrible or genius.

12:19.280 --> 12:20.320
You guys got to help me.

12:20.320 --> 12:29.520
I would find a subject that I had some passing interest in that the person was an expert about.

12:29.520 --> 12:33.440
Like I would talk to them until I found something that they knew a lot about

12:33.440 --> 12:40.400
and then just decide that I was going to absorb all of their knowledge about this specific topic.

12:40.400 --> 12:42.880
I like that.

12:42.880 --> 12:46.480
So maybe they grew up in, in Wisconsin, for example.

12:47.200 --> 12:50.480
Uh, and I was like, I don't know fucking shit about Wisconsin.

12:50.480 --> 12:51.680
Tell me about the tales.

12:52.240 --> 12:56.480
I'm going to learn fucking everything you know about Wisconsin.

12:56.480 --> 13:04.720
I'm going to like put a, put my, my, my little sucker onto your medulla oblongata and absorb all of your knowledge.

13:04.720 --> 13:10.160
I want to know Wisconsin in the biblical sense and that's all we're going to talk about anytime we're together.

13:10.160 --> 13:12.160
You're the big fat worm from Starship Troopers.

13:12.800 --> 13:13.360
Exactly.

13:13.360 --> 13:15.520
You just jack right into the brain matrix.

13:15.520 --> 13:18.160
I love this because it's mutually beneficial.

13:18.160 --> 13:21.520
You get to learn about a subject that you're, you're interested in.

13:21.520 --> 13:27.200
You get a little bit better and they get to like feel like they're, you know, having the interaction with you.

13:27.200 --> 13:28.320
This is great.

13:28.320 --> 13:33.120
But then you say, but then you say, I, you're all used up, Jerry.

13:34.000 --> 13:37.520
Jerry, no, you don't got nothing.

13:37.520 --> 13:39.200
You're all used up, Jerry.

13:39.200 --> 13:41.040
And then you eat his head.

13:41.040 --> 13:41.840
Sorry, Vicky.

13:41.840 --> 13:43.520
I don't have anything else to learn from you.

13:43.520 --> 13:48.800
I'm closing this Wikipedia page and I'm going to learn from somebody else.

13:48.800 --> 13:50.000
What about this?

13:50.000 --> 13:55.680
Make plans with them for like a specific, like we'll have dinner together, right?

13:55.680 --> 14:00.720
And then the other 23 hours of the day are yours.

14:01.360 --> 14:02.880
Oh, that's a good idea, Trav.

14:02.880 --> 14:09.840
Like you could say, well, listen, I got some errands I gotta run, but I'll see you at nine for our dinner and McDonald's, right?

14:09.840 --> 14:12.880
So that way they get to feel like they get the interaction with you.

14:12.880 --> 14:19.120
They don't get to complain about loneliness, but it's not this weird, amorphous hanging out could last forever.

14:20.960 --> 14:21.520
Yeah.

14:21.520 --> 14:23.200
Do you guys want a yahoo hand?

14:23.200 --> 14:24.480
Yeah, that like fixed it.

14:24.480 --> 14:24.880
Thank you.

14:25.760 --> 14:26.560
Here comes the yahoo.

14:26.560 --> 14:29.040
Between those two advices, I think there's some good advice here.

14:29.040 --> 14:30.000
Here comes a fresh one.

14:31.200 --> 14:32.000
Flip it.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.680
Fresh new bio one flipped it off the dome.

14:33.680 --> 14:35.280
It's from Zoe Kinski climbing that ladder.

14:35.280 --> 14:35.840
Thank you, Zoe.

14:35.840 --> 14:38.240
It's by yahoo answers user Archie who asks.

14:41.120 --> 14:45.840
I think I swap bodies with my goldfish at night.

14:45.840 --> 14:46.160
Help.

14:47.840 --> 14:50.160
I think I swap bodies with my goldfish at night.

14:50.160 --> 14:50.480
Help.

14:51.120 --> 14:55.440
When I go to sleep, I keep seeing flashes of an image of blurred water.

14:55.440 --> 15:00.720
Eventually when I go to sleep, all I can see is the inside of my goldfish's goldfish bowl.

15:00.720 --> 15:04.640
And when I swam to the end of the bowl, I could see my body flapping around.

15:04.640 --> 15:06.400
I think I swap bodies with my goldfish.

15:07.520 --> 15:09.520
This happens most nights.

15:10.640 --> 15:12.160
Your body was flapping around.

15:12.160 --> 15:16.000
So the goldfish was in your body freaking the fuck out.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.520
Yeah, you would fucking hate him.

15:17.520 --> 15:21.120
You it's bad for you because because you're a goldfish.

15:21.120 --> 15:23.520
Imagine how bad it is for your sweet goldfish though.

15:23.520 --> 15:26.560
The goldfish is getting the short end of the stick.

15:26.560 --> 15:34.240
Like up till now, the only world this fish has known has been a purely water based one.

15:35.200 --> 15:42.960
But it wait, what if you look over through the watery water of the tank and you see your goldfish.

15:43.520 --> 15:45.600
Goldfish is touching your wife.

15:45.600 --> 15:49.600
No, goldfish, that is my wife.

15:49.600 --> 15:50.960
No, you mustn't.

15:51.440 --> 15:53.120
And it's emptying your bank account.

15:53.840 --> 15:55.200
While touching your wife.

15:55.200 --> 15:57.200
While touching your wife.

15:57.200 --> 15:58.880
Your goldfish is ambidextrous.

15:58.880 --> 16:02.240
One hand on your wife, one hand on the keyboard of your computer.

16:02.240 --> 16:03.520
How is that goldfish not a type?

16:03.520 --> 16:04.480
I don't know.

16:04.480 --> 16:06.000
He was watched you do it.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.600
How long has this been going on?

16:08.880 --> 16:13.760
What if you look over and your goldfish is in your cat and your cat is in your body and

16:13.760 --> 16:15.280
you're in the goldfish?

16:15.280 --> 16:18.320
Yeah, everybody just jumped one to the left.

16:18.320 --> 16:19.040
I like that.

16:19.040 --> 16:29.120
And, but then your wife jumped into your dog and then, oh man, this is getting crazy.

16:29.120 --> 16:32.240
Justin, you there?

16:32.880 --> 16:33.600
Yeah, I'm here.

16:33.600 --> 16:34.160
What happened?

16:34.160 --> 16:34.880
Just listening.

16:34.880 --> 16:36.160
Just doing some fan art.

16:37.040 --> 16:39.680
Doing some fan art of this classic bit.

16:41.280 --> 16:46.560
No, I thought that thought maybe there was an incredible Mr.

16:46.560 --> 16:49.280
Limpet goof in here somewhere.

16:49.280 --> 16:49.840
Fuck, dude.

16:49.840 --> 16:52.880
I could hear the gears turning, but then they didn't turn.

16:53.680 --> 16:57.440
Well, I kept waiting for the moment and then there wasn't one.

16:58.640 --> 17:01.840
So I went to the Wikipedia page for the incredible Mr. Limpet.

17:01.840 --> 17:03.520
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

17:03.520 --> 17:07.280
I knew there was some sort of ghostwriter web surfing going on.

17:08.960 --> 17:13.120
I knew that we caught you in a genuine web surf sequence and I'm glad that we got to

17:13.120 --> 17:14.000
the bottom of it.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.280
Can we talk about Mr.

17:15.280 --> 17:16.560
Limpet for a second?

17:16.560 --> 17:18.960
This is the equivalent of podcast juicing, is what you've discovered.

17:18.960 --> 17:20.400
Like you've caught me with a bag.

17:20.400 --> 17:24.000
Yeah, if juicing made you fucking worse at a thing.

17:24.640 --> 17:25.200
No, it's like you knocked me over.

17:25.200 --> 17:27.920
If juicing distracted you from baseball.

17:27.920 --> 17:33.840
You knocked me over in the locker room and a bag, a little Ziploc baggie of Wikipedias

17:33.840 --> 17:34.160
fell out of my juicer.

17:34.160 --> 17:36.320
No, you were actually next in the order.

17:36.320 --> 17:40.640
You were up to bat, but you weren't fucking there because you were too busy buying the

17:40.640 --> 17:41.360
juice.

17:41.360 --> 17:46.000
It was, I was next to bat and you couldn't find me and then you looked into the crowd

17:46.000 --> 17:47.840
and saw me wandering up and down the aisle.

17:47.840 --> 17:50.000
I was like, does anybody have some steroids?

17:50.000 --> 17:50.480
Yeah.

17:50.480 --> 17:53.200
Hey, does anybody have some steroids before my quick up at bat?

17:55.360 --> 17:59.360
But you're here now and we're back together again and it, ooh, reunited and it feels so

17:59.360 --> 18:00.080
good.

18:00.080 --> 18:02.320
Say something funny about this situation, Justin.

18:02.320 --> 18:03.680
Talk about Mr. Limpet.

18:04.960 --> 18:10.880
Did you know in the film The Incredible Mr. Limpet, he falls in the water and is changed

18:10.880 --> 18:12.800
inexplicably into a fish.

18:13.520 --> 18:14.960
I love that writing, by the way.

18:14.960 --> 18:16.800
It was always my favorite thing about that movie.

18:16.800 --> 18:17.440
It happens.

18:18.160 --> 18:19.840
Nobody questions it.

18:19.840 --> 18:21.280
There's no justification.

18:21.280 --> 18:22.000
It just happens.

18:22.000 --> 18:28.160
Now, the crazier thing, though, is that he falls in love with a fish.

18:28.800 --> 18:33.040
Like how quickly he abandons his humanity.

18:34.080 --> 18:36.960
Okay, so those two explain each other, right?

18:36.960 --> 18:41.120
He falls in the water and he's a fish and for a split second he's like, oh no, my life,

18:41.120 --> 18:41.920
I got to leave it behind.

18:41.920 --> 18:46.240
But then he's also like, but I can finally fuck a fish.

18:46.240 --> 18:49.440
I'm gonna fuck that fish and no one can say shit about it.

18:49.440 --> 18:52.720
And you know the groundwork he's been down with that his whole life secretly.

18:52.720 --> 18:53.220
Yeah.

18:53.920 --> 18:58.640
Can I just say, I remember watching that movie when I was like 10 years old and like, no

18:58.640 --> 19:03.200
joke, the thing that occurred to me when he turned into a fish was, oh, he's dead.

19:03.760 --> 19:04.560
Like he died.

19:04.560 --> 19:05.760
This is like his heaven.

19:05.760 --> 19:07.840
His heaven is like being a fish.

19:07.840 --> 19:11.920
And this movie is about a man who fell in the water and drowned.

19:11.920 --> 19:12.160
Yeah.

19:12.160 --> 19:18.320
And this is all like, as the blood drains from his brain, this is like his fleeting

19:18.320 --> 19:25.680
images of like perfection as he drowned because he becomes a fish and helps fight a war.

19:25.680 --> 19:27.840
Worse, worse, worse than that, Travis.

19:28.640 --> 19:31.280
He falls in the water as he's drowning.

19:31.280 --> 19:39.120
He sees a fish, swaps bodies with it, traps that fish in the prison, in the husk of his

19:39.120 --> 19:40.480
dying human form.

19:40.480 --> 19:44.640
That fish that swaps into his body is probably like, fuck yeah, it's human time.

19:44.640 --> 19:46.160
Wait, dead.

19:46.720 --> 19:48.880
Oh no, body stealer.

19:50.240 --> 19:52.480
Oh, he's like a jumper.

19:52.480 --> 19:54.720
He's a switcher.

19:54.720 --> 19:57.120
He's one of those switchers.

19:57.120 --> 20:02.480
One of those fish switchers I read about in biology class.

20:02.480 --> 20:04.000
So there was nothing in there, huh?

20:05.360 --> 20:07.200
Yeah, it was kind of a, but you know what?

20:07.840 --> 20:18.640
The one thing that I will say is that it's like five minutes closer to not to be, like

20:18.640 --> 20:22.160
there's five more minutes of audio on the recording.

20:22.160 --> 20:24.640
No, they definitely heard us say shit for five minutes.

20:24.640 --> 20:26.480
That is undeniable.

20:26.480 --> 20:28.160
Well, it'll probably be a tight three and a half.

20:28.800 --> 20:29.920
Oop, and there's a sneeze.

20:30.640 --> 20:31.840
That was a second and a half.

20:31.840 --> 20:34.960
Deposit it in the time bank.

20:34.960 --> 20:36.240
We have to keep sneezing.

20:36.240 --> 20:39.280
It's like the burping in Willy Wonka.

20:39.280 --> 20:42.320
Like, if we just keep sneezing, we'll get to the end of the podcast.

20:42.320 --> 20:43.280
I'm working on it.

20:43.280 --> 20:44.400
I'm trying.

20:44.400 --> 20:46.640
God, I have to sneeze.

20:48.000 --> 20:52.080
It's so hot up in this office, and I'm gonna have to have an awkward conversation with

20:52.080 --> 20:53.600
my mailman tomorrow.

20:53.600 --> 20:56.960
I have to sign for a lot of packages, so it's not like I can just hide.

20:57.600 --> 21:02.000
You might have thought you heard me say Teddy Bear Fuckfest, but what I really said was

21:04.640 --> 21:07.120
I said County Fair Fuckfest.

21:07.120 --> 21:08.080
Shit, no way.

21:08.080 --> 21:09.280
How about another question?

21:09.280 --> 21:10.480
Justin, I need you to dial back in.

21:10.480 --> 21:13.280
I need you to hit the internet eject button, my boy.

21:14.160 --> 21:18.880
Three weeks ago, I went with a group of friends to Miami to celebrate a birthday with a surprise

21:18.880 --> 21:19.200
trip.

21:19.760 --> 21:20.800
Bullshit ensued.

21:20.800 --> 21:24.400
So the birthday boy and his GF were left without a room for the weekend.

21:24.400 --> 21:28.640
The GF asked me to front the money and said she was expecting a large sum of money in

21:28.640 --> 21:31.040
a few days and would pay me within five days.

21:31.040 --> 21:35.040
I charged that $350 to my credit card, expecting a prompt repayment.

21:35.600 --> 21:41.840
So far, this sounds like an email for someone asking us to refund a purchase that we did

21:41.840 --> 21:44.640
not contribute to in any way, shape, or form.

21:44.640 --> 21:46.560
It sounds like you're about to hit us up for cash.

21:46.560 --> 21:48.160
But let's press on.

21:48.160 --> 21:51.040
Got $350?

21:51.040 --> 21:54.000
How do I ask for that money without asking for it?

21:54.960 --> 21:56.640
This is not a good question.

21:56.640 --> 22:02.480
Like, there's that app now, Vimmo, where you can just send them a little e-message.

22:02.480 --> 22:04.960
It's like, beep boop beep beep, $350, please.

22:04.960 --> 22:05.920
Pay up.

22:05.920 --> 22:07.280
Beep boop beep beep beep beep beep beep.

22:07.280 --> 22:08.080
You owe me.

22:08.080 --> 22:08.560
I'll cut you.

22:08.560 --> 22:10.800
Can you send them a PayPal invoice?

22:10.800 --> 22:12.880
That's exactly like, yes, you can do that, too.

22:12.880 --> 22:13.920
You have so many options.

22:13.920 --> 22:14.960
You have so many technical options.

22:14.960 --> 22:16.720
Send them a singing telegram.

22:16.720 --> 22:18.160
Well, no, because that's going to cost money.

22:18.160 --> 22:22.480
Although you do have to spend money to make money, as Jay-Z said, vis-a-vis singing telegrams.

22:24.400 --> 22:25.520
That's how you got to start.

22:25.520 --> 22:27.120
Not a lot of people know that.

22:27.120 --> 22:27.600
Yeah.

22:27.600 --> 22:32.240
Would you be able to cut down on the initial expense by becoming a singing telegram person

22:32.240 --> 22:33.200
yourself?

22:33.200 --> 22:38.080
I don't think it would be effective if you got, if you, like, did the singing telegram

22:38.080 --> 22:38.880
asking for money.

22:38.880 --> 22:44.000
But I'm assuming there is an employee discount that you could get somebody else and find

22:44.000 --> 22:48.560
out who is, like, the best one because you would be intimately familiar with the organization

22:49.600 --> 22:53.600
to get a cheaper singing telegram to ask for the money.

22:54.400 --> 22:56.880
So you're saying we solve this from the inside.

22:56.880 --> 22:58.000
Yeah, you go inside.

22:58.000 --> 22:58.960
You go deep.

22:58.960 --> 23:00.720
But that's company, that's theft.

23:01.280 --> 23:02.640
That's theft from the company.

23:02.640 --> 23:03.680
It's embezzlement?

23:03.680 --> 23:04.880
I think it's embezzlement.

23:04.880 --> 23:09.120
If you use up the singing telegrams for your own gains, I think that's embezzlement.

23:09.120 --> 23:09.760
Yeah, for sure.

23:10.960 --> 23:12.000
No, no.

23:12.000 --> 23:17.680
You, I mean, you would still pay, but you'd pay the employee rate and it would be cheaper

23:17.680 --> 23:19.680
for you to hire a singing telegram.

23:19.680 --> 23:25.440
Or maybe they would do it as, like, you would go to them and they'd be like, listen, every

23:25.440 --> 23:32.640
singing telegram person gets one for free as a professional courtesy through the union

23:32.640 --> 23:38.800
and the long, long history that we all share together as a career because it's the oldest

23:38.800 --> 23:39.600
profession.

23:39.600 --> 23:40.080
Yes.

23:40.080 --> 23:42.240
And they say, this is your one favor.

23:42.240 --> 23:43.600
Are you sure you want to expand it on this?

23:43.600 --> 23:45.280
But then it's like, God, I don't know.

23:46.400 --> 23:51.600
Maybe what do you do next time you're trapped under a boulder and you need to get a message

23:51.600 --> 23:52.640
to the outside?

23:52.640 --> 23:53.040
Yeah, sure.

23:53.040 --> 23:56.640
And you can't rub that little medallion that they gave you when you got hired.

23:56.640 --> 23:59.280
Valar Morghulis, sing for me.

24:02.400 --> 24:07.840
A man will sing one time to one name that you tell him to sing to.

24:07.840 --> 24:10.880
Do you want to use that to get the $350?

24:10.880 --> 24:11.600
Because I get it.

24:11.600 --> 24:12.000
I do.

24:12.000 --> 24:13.120
Times are tight.

24:13.120 --> 24:18.240
A fucking blind crow flies up to you and it's like, happy birthday, Susan.

24:22.720 --> 24:23.120
All right.

24:23.120 --> 24:23.440
Bye.

24:24.240 --> 24:25.360
How many minutes was those?

24:26.320 --> 24:27.840
Listen, I'm sorry.

24:27.840 --> 24:28.960
I have to use the restroom.

24:28.960 --> 24:29.520
That's fine.

24:29.520 --> 24:30.400
We're going to keep on.

24:30.400 --> 24:32.240
Keep this goof train rolling.

24:32.240 --> 24:32.880
Keep going.

24:34.080 --> 24:35.280
Is there an answer to this?

24:35.280 --> 24:37.920
No, we should wait for Justin to get back from the bathroom.

24:37.920 --> 24:38.160
Okay.

24:38.160 --> 24:40.560
You know how uncomfortable it gets when it's just the two of us.

24:40.560 --> 24:41.360
God knows.

24:42.400 --> 24:44.320
It's just that we have nothing in common.

24:46.560 --> 24:48.560
How are, how's the wife?

24:49.360 --> 24:50.080
That's not true.

24:50.080 --> 24:56.880
We, you remember, you remember breakfast at Denny's?

24:58.080 --> 25:00.400
I think I remember the time.

25:00.400 --> 25:04.000
And I said, what about breakfast at Denny's?

25:04.000 --> 25:06.320
Breakfast at Denny's, you said.

25:06.320 --> 25:10.640
I got diarrhea for three years.

25:10.640 --> 25:14.880
I said, that sounds like that might have killed you.

25:14.880 --> 25:17.120
And you said, that's right.

25:17.120 --> 25:18.480
Because now I'm a ghost.

25:24.720 --> 25:25.280
Yeah, all right.

25:25.280 --> 25:26.400
That one could stay in.

25:29.200 --> 25:32.480
For this episode, I'm going to be less like an editor and more like a bouncer.

25:32.480 --> 25:33.600
Like, all right, all right.

25:33.600 --> 25:34.160
You're cool.

25:35.200 --> 25:35.680
Sorry, man.

25:35.680 --> 25:37.120
We got too many sneezes in here.

25:37.120 --> 25:38.240
You got to wait outside.

25:40.160 --> 25:40.560
What's that?

25:40.560 --> 25:42.480
A song parody of breakfast at Tiffany's?

25:42.480 --> 25:42.880
What is it?

25:42.880 --> 25:44.000
Breakfast at Denny's?

25:44.000 --> 25:44.960
Diarrhea jokes?

25:44.960 --> 25:45.760
Yeah, man.

25:45.760 --> 25:49.520
Bring in, you can come in, bring your three friends back.

25:49.520 --> 25:50.800
Hey, all right.

25:50.800 --> 25:51.520
Let's get back into it.

25:52.480 --> 25:56.640
Justin, we did a good bit about breakfast at, I sang breakfast at Denny's.

25:56.640 --> 25:58.320
Like, it was breakfast at Tiffany's.

25:58.320 --> 25:59.360
It was fucked pretty great.

25:59.360 --> 26:00.320
That sounds funny.

26:00.320 --> 26:01.040
Yeah, it was good.

26:01.040 --> 26:01.760
You missed it.

26:01.760 --> 26:03.360
You can listen to it later.

26:03.360 --> 26:05.120
We have, did we finish that last one?

26:06.400 --> 26:06.880
I don't know.

26:06.880 --> 26:07.920
I was in the bathroom.

26:09.040 --> 26:11.600
We did not, but I can right now.

26:12.480 --> 26:15.280
You have to ask and it sucks and it's the worst.

26:15.920 --> 26:16.560
No, you don't.

26:16.560 --> 26:18.160
I'm saying you have Venmo now.

26:18.160 --> 26:19.600
I don't have Venmo, by the way.

26:19.600 --> 26:22.880
So I, like, friends send me money for like meals and stuff.

26:22.880 --> 26:26.240
Like, I buy for the group and it's like, Jeff has sent you 10 bucks.

26:26.240 --> 26:26.960
You want it?

26:26.960 --> 26:28.560
And I say, no Venmo.

26:28.560 --> 26:30.160
You're not going to get your fucking hands on me.

26:30.160 --> 26:34.880
And no, Griffin, but what I'm saying is all of that obfuscation,

26:34.880 --> 26:39.120
all of that avoidance behavior of like, oh, I'm going to gently ask

26:39.120 --> 26:40.720
if you want it, right?

26:40.720 --> 26:43.920
And you want there to be no confusion.

26:44.480 --> 26:47.840
Like, you just have to say like, oh, by the way, when you get a second hit,

26:47.840 --> 26:49.680
I'm going to need that $350 back.

26:49.680 --> 26:50.800
I need to pay my credit card.

26:50.800 --> 26:52.000
With the juice.

26:55.120 --> 26:56.160
Maybe that's what you do.

26:56.160 --> 26:59.920
You sneak up behind her and just sort of whisper in her ear,

26:59.920 --> 27:01.280
the juice is running.

27:05.920 --> 27:06.560
What did you say?

27:07.920 --> 27:09.360
What did you just, what did you say?

27:09.360 --> 27:10.800
I didn't say anything.

27:16.320 --> 27:17.120
What happened?

27:17.760 --> 27:20.800
I literally like, I literally, I understand you're like asking for something,

27:20.800 --> 27:21.600
but I don't understand.

27:21.600 --> 27:25.120
The juice, the juice is running.

27:27.200 --> 27:29.440
You have very nice kneecaps.

27:29.440 --> 27:32.320
I would hate to, the juice is running.

27:35.520 --> 27:38.320
You know how people put hits out on people like,

27:39.200 --> 27:40.560
that owe them money, right?

27:40.560 --> 27:45.360
The juice, as we've mentioned previously, the juice is running.

27:46.080 --> 27:50.800
There should be, and then like, if you know, it's a real nice place

27:50.800 --> 27:53.600
you got here, it'd be real shame if something happened to you.

27:53.600 --> 27:54.560
I'm melting.

27:55.760 --> 27:58.320
And you like, knock a painting off the wall.

27:58.320 --> 28:00.880
Like, oh, God, I hate what actually happened.

28:00.880 --> 28:03.920
It'd be a real shame if, and then you get like more threatening,

28:03.920 --> 28:06.320
so you get up like the Nancy Kerrigan level of like,

28:06.320 --> 28:09.760
it's a real nice ice you got here, be ashamed if you fell on it.

28:09.760 --> 28:13.040
And then, yeah, like that's, that's, that's terrible,

28:13.600 --> 28:19.120
but there needs to be something like that for more sort of like,

28:19.120 --> 28:21.920
manageable, trivial amounts of trivial things.

28:21.920 --> 28:23.520
What I want is like, it's a real nice friendship.

28:23.520 --> 28:26.960
It'd be a shame if like, he stopped taking you to movies.

28:26.960 --> 28:31.920
I want somebody to run up to this girlfriend and throw a pie in her face

28:31.920 --> 28:34.000
and just whisper like, the juice is running.

28:34.000 --> 28:35.760
The juice will flow.

28:39.040 --> 28:43.200
There will always be more pies.

28:43.200 --> 28:49.760
Real nice pies I have at home.

28:49.760 --> 28:52.560
It'd be a shame if something happened to them.

28:52.560 --> 28:55.040
It'd be a shame if they got a face at them.

28:55.040 --> 28:58.800
It'd be a shame to get some faces in these nice pies.

28:58.800 --> 29:11.120
My husband is a baker, the juice flows.

29:22.640 --> 29:25.680
My Brother, My Brother, Me has brought it to you in part by Squarespace,

29:25.680 --> 29:29.760

29:45.280 --> 29:52.560
I made a website called, it's at SheetsShow.com with a Z, Sheets with a Z, Show.com.

29:52.560 --> 29:57.840
I made it with Squarespace. It's a fucking, you could probably do even better than that.

29:57.840 --> 29:59.280
Maybe with Squarespace.

29:59.280 --> 30:02.080
I just had a brilliant idea for Squarespace tie-in.

30:02.880 --> 30:06.800
We need to create a website called thejuice.com.

30:07.520 --> 30:12.480
And basically when you loan someone money, you log into thejuice.com

30:13.120 --> 30:21.120
and it starts a reminder chain until you turn it off that you still owe that person 350.

30:21.120 --> 30:25.440
And it starts just like after 72 hours, you get an update.

30:25.440 --> 30:28.640
And then pretty soon, it's like every hour.

30:28.640 --> 30:33.120
And every missive is read by Gary Sinise.

30:33.120 --> 30:33.440
Yep.

30:34.640 --> 30:35.920
Very threatening presence.

30:35.920 --> 30:39.840
Yeah, but he gets more and more threatening as thejuice.

30:40.560 --> 30:45.200
Threatening, but like seemingly like, you know, like logical.

30:45.200 --> 30:46.000
Yeah, when it starts out.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.720
Not like a crazy person, not like he's gonna be like,

30:48.720 --> 30:53.680
I'm gonna kill you no matter what, but like very reasonable as long as the juice continues to flow.

30:55.280 --> 30:56.560
Yeah, it starts out, he's your friend.

30:56.560 --> 31:00.080
Listen, the juice is fine, but I know you're good for it.

31:00.080 --> 31:01.760
So just bring whenever you can.

31:01.760 --> 31:06.000
Maybe it's Gary Sinise and William H. Macy, a little like good cop, bad cop.

31:06.000 --> 31:07.440
Oh man, which one's which though?

31:08.240 --> 31:09.520
Well, they take turns.

31:09.520 --> 31:09.920
Yeah.

31:09.920 --> 31:10.960
Let's finish the commercial.

31:12.000 --> 31:13.360
Squarespace, build it beautiful.

31:13.360 --> 31:18.640
Beautiful.

31:18.640 --> 31:19.760
Did you read the offer code?

31:21.600 --> 31:22.240
Yeah.

31:22.240 --> 31:22.640
You did?

31:23.760 --> 31:24.240
Yeah.

31:24.240 --> 31:25.280
You pretty sure?

31:25.280 --> 31:28.640
I think everyone remembers that it's my brother, all one word.

31:28.640 --> 31:30.480
And you get 10% off your first purchase.

31:30.480 --> 31:30.720
Okay.

31:30.720 --> 31:31.040
Yeah.

31:31.040 --> 31:31.760
All right, that's fine.

31:32.320 --> 31:36.080
I also want to mention that my brother and my brother Mia supported in part by Casper,

31:36.080 --> 31:39.200
an online retailer of premium obsessively engineered mattresses,

31:39.200 --> 31:41.200
which you can get for a fraction of the price.

31:41.200 --> 31:45.680
It doesn't say a fraction of the price of what, but I'm going to guess other mattresses.

31:45.680 --> 31:48.640
But there's probably a lot of things that is a fraction of the price of.

31:48.640 --> 31:49.440
A full home.

31:50.000 --> 31:50.800
A Bugatti.

31:50.800 --> 31:51.680
A Bugatti.

31:56.160 --> 31:57.760
I don't know what that is.

31:57.760 --> 31:58.800
I love it though.

31:58.800 --> 31:59.280
I love it too.

31:59.280 --> 32:01.360
It's like a mole man gangster.

32:01.360 --> 32:04.080
It's like he swallows certain consonants, but they change.

32:04.640 --> 32:08.000
Anyway, Casper has a risk-free trial and return policy.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.800
You can try sleeping on a Casper for a hundred days.

32:10.800 --> 32:14.720
That's six and a half months with free delivery and painless returns.

32:14.720 --> 32:19.760
These are mattresses that are made in America so that you know that they're full of liberty.

32:19.760 --> 32:24.080
And my brother, my brother and me listeners can get $50 towards any mattress purchase.

32:24.080 --> 32:28.160
You just go to Casper.com slash my brother and use the promo code my brother.

32:28.160 --> 32:30.000
That's all one word at the checkout.

32:30.000 --> 32:33.200
Terms and conditions do apply on that particular transaction.

32:33.200 --> 32:34.880
I sleep on a Casper mattress.

32:34.880 --> 32:36.240
I love it very, very much.

32:36.240 --> 32:40.400
It replaced my old mattress and I've never looked back.

32:40.400 --> 32:41.840
They're fine products.

32:41.840 --> 32:43.920
You are, you're going to be pleased with these.

32:43.920 --> 32:44.560
I guarantee.

32:45.200 --> 32:46.400
We have another message.

32:46.400 --> 32:48.320
Let me tell you about Wild Speculation.

32:48.960 --> 32:54.080
Wild Speculation is a comedy podcast hosted by Henry and Brandon, two childhood friends

32:54.080 --> 32:59.280
turned 20-something Portlanders who explore a vast world of hypotheticals ranging from

32:59.280 --> 33:04.480
which superhero would make the best lover to what will the next big health fad be to

33:04.480 --> 33:07.920
which American president would win in a 44-man cage match.

33:07.920 --> 33:12.880
It's a lively romp through time, space, sarcasm, and what would happen if Liam Neeson had to

33:12.880 --> 33:14.640
fight a wolf in all of his movies.

33:14.640 --> 33:16.400
I'm pretty sure that already happens.

33:16.400 --> 33:22.400
But anyways, go to wildspeculationpodcast.com and check out the sam- you can check out the

33:22.400 --> 33:29.840
sampler bit.ly forward slash wildspeculation or find Wild Speculation on iTunes or Stitcher

33:29.840 --> 33:30.640
and subscribe.

33:30.640 --> 33:32.080
There's lots of ways to listen to it.

33:32.080 --> 33:32.960
You should go check it out.

33:32.960 --> 33:33.520
All right, listen.

33:33.520 --> 33:36.160
I gotta- wait, listen, listen, wait, listen.

33:36.160 --> 33:38.400
You probably- yours is probably more pressing.

33:38.960 --> 33:39.920
It's very pressing.

33:41.280 --> 33:43.520
There are a lot of subplots in the movie Love Actually.

33:45.040 --> 33:47.680
I don't think anybody would notice if we added one more.

33:48.480 --> 33:53.200
Maybe after Liam Neeson sees off his son who's falling in love with the girl who sings the

33:53.200 --> 33:58.720
song at the end of the movie, spoiler alert for Love Actually, he had to fight a fucking

33:58.720 --> 33:59.520
wolf.

33:59.520 --> 34:01.040
I- I've never seen it.

34:01.040 --> 34:04.240
But Griffin, is it about all the storylines signed together?

34:04.240 --> 34:04.880
Yeah?

34:04.880 --> 34:06.080
Yes, and the wolf-

34:06.080 --> 34:07.200
Wait, wait a minute.

34:07.760 --> 34:09.840
Stop the podcast.

34:09.840 --> 34:11.600
You've never seen Love Actually?

34:11.600 --> 34:12.320
That is correct.

34:12.320 --> 34:14.080
I'm- I'm waiting for the right moment.

34:14.080 --> 34:14.800
That's it.

34:14.800 --> 34:15.200
You're waiting for the-

34:15.200 --> 34:16.320
I want it to be perfect.

34:16.320 --> 34:18.800
You're waiting for the Lupine director's cut.

34:20.080 --> 34:20.720
Yep.

34:20.720 --> 34:24.080
I just want a wolf fight to be going on in the background of one scene.

34:24.080 --> 34:25.600
I'm proud of you.

34:25.600 --> 34:26.880
I'm proud of you, son.

34:28.320 --> 34:29.120
Ah, fuck.

34:29.120 --> 34:29.600
Not again.

34:29.600 --> 34:35.120
I have to go fight a wolf now, and then you just see the wolf fight in the back of a different

34:35.120 --> 34:38.240
scene, and it's just like, oh, it all ties together.

34:38.240 --> 34:39.840
That was the wolf from before.

34:39.840 --> 34:43.600
But then, he doesn't kill the wolf, he just beats the shit out of it, and the wolf limps

34:43.600 --> 34:47.520
off, and Mr. Bean from that movie finds him, because Mr. Bean doesn't get, like, a romantic

34:47.520 --> 34:48.480
resolution in that film.

34:48.480 --> 34:52.560
He falls in love with the wolf, they have fucking crazy looking wolf children.

34:53.280 --> 34:58.800
We just read an ad for a podcast that at the end of the ad described what I assume

34:58.800 --> 35:05.200
is, perhaps, a signature bit for this program, and then we were like, oh, sounds funny.

35:05.200 --> 35:06.880
We'll take that.

35:06.880 --> 35:11.040
Let's see if we can steal from these people, too.

35:11.040 --> 35:11.680
That's fair.

35:11.680 --> 35:15.520
We got a special message from Michelle D. from Kevin H.

35:15.520 --> 35:20.000
Dear Shell Bell, I want to wish you happy birthday, and you're first as my wife.

35:20.000 --> 35:22.800
I love you and the time we spend together with all my heart.

35:24.080 --> 35:24.880
Make fun of that, assholes.

35:24.880 --> 35:25.920
Yeah, I don't think we can.

35:25.920 --> 35:27.440
What if they had to fight a wolf?

35:27.440 --> 35:33.040
Kevin, Michelle, your union and love is a constant sense of

35:34.480 --> 35:37.520
disappointment, joy, and optimism.

35:38.080 --> 35:40.720
I think there should be another storyline in Love Actually.

35:40.720 --> 35:40.880
Yeah.

35:41.840 --> 35:42.800
That's you guys.

35:43.440 --> 35:44.240
Just, like, you know what?

35:44.240 --> 35:47.120
We should just keep, like, George Lucas-ing people into Love Actually.

35:47.120 --> 35:48.800
Right, no, no, it's not George Lucas-ing.

35:48.800 --> 35:51.200
It's, like, there's so many fucking subplots in that movie.

35:51.200 --> 35:54.400
Let's keep adding stuff in, and I think we can add one in that's, like, those books that

35:54.400 --> 35:55.520
your parents would buy you as a kid.

35:55.520 --> 35:59.200
It's, like, this is a story about Gregory the space boy.

35:59.200 --> 36:00.320
You know what I mean?

36:00.320 --> 36:00.640
I do.

36:00.640 --> 36:05.520
You know what would be fucking, like, the most lucrative business ever is if you told

36:05.520 --> 36:11.440
people that you would make them, like, for an anniversary or wedding gift or what have

36:11.440 --> 36:19.120
you, a custom version of Love Actually with their storyline intercut in between the different

36:19.120 --> 36:20.240
storylines.

36:20.240 --> 36:22.400
What would you pay for Love Actually?

36:22.400 --> 36:25.440
To have Armie Hammer play you in a movie today.

36:25.440 --> 36:25.920
Fuck.

36:25.920 --> 36:30.800
Well, I don't think you're going to stage the scenes with Hollywood A-listers.

36:30.800 --> 36:31.040
I don't think-

36:31.040 --> 36:33.040
Well, then how else would you do it, Justin?

36:33.040 --> 36:35.520
You would have, like, everybody's got iPhones.

36:35.520 --> 36:39.840
You've probably got a whole dramatic arc on your iPhone that we could cobble together.

36:40.720 --> 36:41.200
That's fair.

36:41.200 --> 36:44.800
What if you, but then you do that, and then you get too deep in the art, and you're like,

36:44.800 --> 36:48.080
listen, listen, these scenes aren't working.

36:48.080 --> 36:49.920
I'm sorry, Kevin and Michelle.

36:49.920 --> 36:52.000
I'm cutting you back out of the movie.

36:52.000 --> 36:54.400
I'm putting you back on the cutting room floor.

36:54.400 --> 36:59.760
I'm too deep into my new director's cut of Love Actually.

36:59.760 --> 37:01.200
I can't believe you haven't seen Love Actually.

37:01.200 --> 37:07.440
This holiday season, Travis, get ready to set sail to the island of joy and love as

37:07.440 --> 37:09.760
we watch Love Actually together as a family.

37:09.760 --> 37:10.000
Okay.

37:12.080 --> 37:15.360
We're Dave and Graham, and we host Stop Podcasting Yourself.

37:15.360 --> 37:21.120
We started this podcast back in 2008 before podcasts had to have any kind of concept,

37:21.120 --> 37:23.040
so we don't really know how to describe it.

37:23.040 --> 37:28.480
It's kind of like going to the barbershop if your barber knew all about the first season

37:28.480 --> 37:29.760
of the show Elf.

37:29.760 --> 37:34.160
It's like a 90-minute massage where the masseuse is two people talking to each other with a

37:34.160 --> 37:35.040
third person.

37:35.040 --> 37:40.400
It's like the Monsters of Metal tour, only quieter, no music, and just talking.

37:40.400 --> 37:44.880
It's like a makeout session, but without the lips touching, they just talk a lot.

37:44.880 --> 37:52.800
Download Stop Podcasting Yourself from iTunes or MaximumFun.org.

37:52.800 --> 37:53.680
The elevator Yahoo.

37:55.120 --> 37:55.440
Okay.

37:56.480 --> 37:58.400
We've only done two actual questions.

37:59.760 --> 38:01.520
This Yahoo is how this usually goes.

38:01.520 --> 38:04.080
This Yahoo is sent by Drew Davenport, and I'm gonna be honest with you guys.

38:04.880 --> 38:08.560
This one's mostly for me, and it's more of just sort of a jumping off point for a discussion

38:08.560 --> 38:09.920
I've been meaning to have with the two of you.

38:09.920 --> 38:18.240
This Yahoo was asked by an anonymous user who asks, will there be any gyms when Pokemon

38:18.240 --> 38:19.280
Go comes out?

38:20.640 --> 38:21.760
What is Pokemon Go?

38:22.560 --> 38:25.120
Is there any talk of official gyms being opened?

38:25.120 --> 38:28.480
How weird would it be if my hubby and I started a gym?

38:28.480 --> 38:32.960
We have an idea of handing out little badges if someone can beat us and our actual gym

38:32.960 --> 38:37.280
junkie friends, scary looking personal trainers who are secret mega nerds.

38:37.280 --> 38:40.720
Good idea, bad idea, is there going to be an official gym?

38:40.720 --> 38:46.240
Pokemon Go, Travis, is an upcoming mobile game that is location-based where you collect

38:46.240 --> 38:48.960
Pokemon, but on your phone.

38:48.960 --> 38:50.560
Oh, that sounds interesting.

38:51.520 --> 38:58.880
My question is this, can I turn my house into a Pokemon gym and then children would come

38:58.880 --> 39:00.400
to me to try and best me?

39:00.400 --> 39:05.440
Of course, they don't stand a fucking chance, but it's good to have aspirations.

39:05.440 --> 39:06.720
It's good to have aspirations.

39:08.240 --> 39:14.400
The key here, Griffin, you need to have 15 friends all standing facing different directions

39:14.400 --> 39:20.720
within your home that when they walk through, they get engaged in a fight with your 15 friends.

39:20.720 --> 39:26.000
I'll need to make paths out of garbage cans or something to force them to-

39:26.000 --> 39:30.400
Or maybe some trees growing up through the floor that they might have to cut through.

39:30.400 --> 39:33.280
Yeah, we're basically talking about a kid maze in my house.

39:33.280 --> 39:40.800
Yes, you have to build a kid labyrinth, a kid dungeon in your home that they have to

39:40.800 --> 39:47.200
fight a bunch of adults to fight a big adult to get a bath.

39:47.200 --> 39:53.360
Griffin's just sitting at the end juggling two glass balls and super tight pants just

39:53.360 --> 39:56.320
waiting for his kid delivery once he bests his minions.

39:56.320 --> 40:00.000
They would be pokeballs, and also it's not a kid delivery, there's no fucking guarantee

40:00.000 --> 40:06.240
that a kid that comes into the beginning of my crucible makes it to the end of it undefeated.

40:07.360 --> 40:12.080
In fact, I'm going to stack this gym with fucking pros.

40:15.200 --> 40:16.320
It's going to be brutal.

40:16.320 --> 40:18.320
It's going to be a torture chamber.

40:18.320 --> 40:19.200
What's the theme?

40:19.200 --> 40:20.960
Are you like- Is it a bug theme?

40:20.960 --> 40:21.440
Is it-

40:21.440 --> 40:22.000
Yeah, Travis.

40:23.840 --> 40:24.480
Yeah, Travis.

40:24.480 --> 40:28.720
I'm going to open up a bug type Pokemon gym, you idiot.

40:28.720 --> 40:33.040
Yeah, that's what I want because I want to give out- I want to shit out badges for every

40:33.040 --> 40:34.960
ham and egg-er that comes to my front door.

40:36.000 --> 40:37.040
Yeah, that's right, Travis.

40:37.040 --> 40:37.920
Go, Caterpie.

40:37.920 --> 40:39.920
That's me, you fucking imbecile.

40:39.920 --> 40:40.400
Yeah, go.

40:41.280 --> 40:42.560
Do your best, Kakuna.

40:43.120 --> 40:45.840
What are you fucking talking- Yeah, bug type gym.

40:47.760 --> 40:49.680
All right, I'm going to go.

40:49.680 --> 40:51.280
I've embarrassed myself.

40:51.280 --> 40:52.000
Maybe fire.

40:52.960 --> 40:53.440
Fire type?

40:53.440 --> 40:54.560
Could you do fire type?

40:54.560 --> 40:55.040
Maybe a fire-

40:55.040 --> 40:57.040
Yeah, that's a good idea, Justin.

40:57.040 --> 41:02.080
I'll probably just do a fire type one so that one kid with one Blastoise can fuck up my

41:02.080 --> 41:02.720
whole shop.

41:04.400 --> 41:06.080
Killed all of us with one Blastoise, huh?

41:06.080 --> 41:06.560
Wow, shit.

41:06.560 --> 41:07.520
I should have-

41:07.520 --> 41:08.480
Just do rock then.

41:08.480 --> 41:10.000
Just do rock type.

41:10.000 --> 41:14.400
The same Blastoise would fuck my rocks.

41:14.400 --> 41:16.240
What sense does that make, by the way?

41:16.960 --> 41:19.040
Why is rock weak against water?

41:19.040 --> 41:20.880
Are they talking about erosion?

41:20.880 --> 41:21.200
Erosion, yes.

41:21.200 --> 41:23.840
Because that happens over thousands of years.

41:23.840 --> 41:24.080
Yeah.

41:24.640 --> 41:26.480
It's a long grift, no doubt.

41:26.480 --> 41:28.320
What about a grasp type gym, Griffin?

41:28.320 --> 41:29.760
You guys are fucking killing me.

41:30.480 --> 41:31.200
Poison type.

41:31.200 --> 41:31.760
Stabbing type.

41:31.760 --> 41:33.040
Now, poison type is not a bad idea.

41:33.760 --> 41:35.680
You know there really is a poison type.

41:35.680 --> 41:36.160
Yes, I do.

41:36.720 --> 41:37.520
That one's kind of tough.

41:37.520 --> 41:39.600
Nobody can really keep straight what does good yet.

41:39.600 --> 41:43.440
I think ground, but that one I think I might trip up a few kids.

41:43.440 --> 41:45.680
That one I think I might catch a few kids in my web.

41:45.680 --> 41:47.280
Just poison some kids.

41:47.280 --> 41:55.920
I love that we open the show talking about how fucking stupid and awful our schedules

41:55.920 --> 42:00.720
are now and now we also have to account for many nights of the week.

42:00.720 --> 42:05.600
Griffin will be sitting in like a secluded room in his home

42:06.160 --> 42:08.080
waiting for children to beat him at Pokemon.

42:08.080 --> 42:10.880
Well, no, there's also going to be, I mean, I got to get the fucking things.

42:11.520 --> 42:12.240
There's going to be a lot of-

42:12.240 --> 42:13.200
Well, there's other people there.

42:13.200 --> 42:15.280
There's going to be a lot of me going around gathering.

42:15.280 --> 42:17.840
Yeah, I'll have some sort of secondary Pokemon.

42:17.840 --> 42:22.880
No one ever talks about that in the Pokemon world until a child shows up to challenge

42:22.880 --> 42:24.720
this building full of adults.

42:24.720 --> 42:28.720
Are all the adults just standing around going, man, I hope somebody shows up.

42:28.720 --> 42:31.280
Boy, it'd be great if you get some fucking kids up in here.

42:31.280 --> 42:32.400
I am fucking-

42:32.400 --> 42:35.120
I am bored.

42:35.120 --> 42:37.680
There is literally nothing else in this gym.

42:38.720 --> 42:42.000
That's how they stick their heads out the door like, hey, are there any local kids?

42:42.800 --> 42:45.920
Any local kids in the neighborhood want to come over and play Pokemon?

42:45.920 --> 42:49.280
That's definitely, definitely going to be me though.

42:50.080 --> 42:51.200
Where's Griffin?

42:51.200 --> 42:52.640
We haven't heard from him in a while.

42:52.640 --> 42:56.560
Last I heard, he was in the Mojave Desert and he was just walking around catching sand

42:56.560 --> 42:56.960
shrews.

42:57.680 --> 42:58.880
That's going to be me.

42:58.880 --> 43:02.880
When that shit drops, I will be a distant memory to the two of you.

43:04.800 --> 43:10.480
This podcast will be golden oldies because it will be canceled because they don't get

43:10.480 --> 43:11.440
Wi-Fi in the Mojave.

43:13.520 --> 43:17.200
I quit coffee a couple of weeks ago and I basically gone through all the withdrawal

43:17.200 --> 43:19.920
symptoms and no longer have headaches.

43:19.920 --> 43:24.400
However, whenever I smell coffee, I still really want it and last night I had a dream

43:24.400 --> 43:25.440
about drinking coffee.

43:26.000 --> 43:27.520
Have any of you ever quit coffee?

43:27.520 --> 43:31.360
And if so, are there any tricks you use to convince your brain to stop wanting coffee?

43:31.360 --> 43:35.200
And that's from Laura and the answer is never in a million bajillion years.

43:35.200 --> 43:39.200
I have recently cut back from five cups in the morning to two.

43:39.200 --> 43:41.120
Gotta have my cup of mud.

43:41.120 --> 43:42.080
Gotta have my joe.

43:44.080 --> 43:45.200
I gotta have my joe.

43:46.080 --> 43:49.280
I basically have a symbiotic relationship with caffeine at this point.

43:49.280 --> 43:50.720
I don't think of it as a drug.

43:50.720 --> 43:52.480
I think of it as a partnership.

43:52.480 --> 43:53.840
Let me tell you how I feel.

43:53.840 --> 43:56.640
This is my feelings towards both coffee and beer.

43:56.640 --> 44:01.520
They are the closest things to magical potions that exist in real life.

44:02.640 --> 44:09.520
They are the closest thing to like a Zelda, Legend of Zelda style, drink this red thing,

44:09.520 --> 44:14.560
drink this blue thing and feel instantly different that exists in the world.

44:16.400 --> 44:18.000
A five hour energy drink.

44:18.000 --> 44:23.200
It's the fact that you have like one thing that you can definitely control.

44:23.200 --> 44:27.200
You have one thing that you can definitely do and that's make yourself feel a little

44:27.200 --> 44:28.320
less sleepy.

44:28.320 --> 44:34.240
Only now in my life, I started morning caffeine when I was like sophomore in high school,

44:34.960 --> 44:38.880
drinking a Diet Mountain Dew every morning to just get the engine revving.

44:38.880 --> 44:42.400
I had a lot of what you would describe as high octane fuel.

44:42.400 --> 44:52.720
Yeah, I had a lot of what you could charitably describe as bowel issues, but I've been doing

44:52.720 --> 44:52.960
that.

44:52.960 --> 44:54.720
I wouldn't know how to...

44:54.720 --> 44:58.400
I'm never gonna do that and it's kind of nice to make your peace with that because

44:58.400 --> 45:00.640
then you can stop sweating it, right?

45:00.640 --> 45:03.680
Like I'm never gonna stop ever.

45:03.680 --> 45:04.400
I'll never quit.

45:04.400 --> 45:05.120
It's not a test.

45:05.120 --> 45:09.600
Like there's not somebody when you're 40 who's gonna go, still drinking coffee, huh?

45:11.360 --> 45:11.920
Don't talk to me.

45:11.920 --> 45:13.680
Don't talk to me until I've had my coffee.

45:15.200 --> 45:16.240
Guys, I don't exercise.

45:16.240 --> 45:17.440
It makes my coffee spill.

45:20.720 --> 45:22.640
Now say something about wine.

45:22.640 --> 45:24.240
Hey guys, I don't have a problem with coffee.

45:24.240 --> 45:25.840
I have a problem without coffee.

45:32.160 --> 45:36.160
Okay, so now that we've locked this person in their life decisions.

45:36.160 --> 45:37.680
No, it's a bad decision.

45:37.680 --> 45:38.240
Just get...

45:38.240 --> 45:40.400
Okay, but listen, you're in a rare...

45:40.400 --> 45:43.360
Let me just tell you, this is probably not what you came to hear.

45:43.360 --> 45:49.120
So you can stop listening now if you're worried about your resolve wavering.

45:49.120 --> 45:52.000
We're gonna make some goofs and you can stop listening to them.

45:52.000 --> 45:52.480
It's okay.

45:52.480 --> 45:54.000
And there's no harm done.

45:54.560 --> 46:00.800
You are in like a righteous position that I wish I was in where you could drink coffee

46:00.800 --> 46:02.000
now and feel it.

46:04.000 --> 46:06.400
I only feel not coffee.

46:06.400 --> 46:08.080
Like I can't feel coffee.

46:08.080 --> 46:11.760
The only feeling I have is not coffee and Justin.

46:11.760 --> 46:15.360
Those are the two different settings I have, okay?

46:15.360 --> 46:19.520
I don't have a feeling of like, wow, I'm drinking coffee.

46:19.520 --> 46:21.040
Like I can't feel anymore.

46:21.040 --> 46:27.360
You are in a position to get like a mild, a PSL.

46:27.360 --> 46:33.680
Just to really dial into the message we're putting out here right now is we are making

46:33.680 --> 46:38.160
this person who has shown that they possess a level of willpower that the three of us

46:38.160 --> 46:39.360
couldn't even imagine.

46:39.920 --> 46:40.560
Combined.

46:40.560 --> 46:41.200
Combined.

46:41.760 --> 46:46.160
We are trying to sell them on just how fucking good a relapse is gonna feel.

46:46.160 --> 46:49.440
Oh my god, it's gonna feel so...

46:49.440 --> 46:58.000
Do you guys know how like, how many things in my life, like how many choices I would

46:58.000 --> 47:02.720
need to undo before coffee was the bad guy?

47:02.720 --> 47:07.520
Like if I got to a point where coffee was like, well, all I've got left is this coffee,

47:07.520 --> 47:12.160
I would have ascended to like a Buddha-like state of transcendence at that point.

47:12.160 --> 47:18.880
Like I have infinite like just life cruft that I would need to dust off of myself before

47:18.880 --> 47:24.800
I even saw coffee in the emotional wreckage that is my current day to day.

47:24.800 --> 47:27.760
Like I can't even find coffee right now.

47:27.760 --> 47:30.960
I don't even know where, I'm not even aware that I'm drinking it because I'm doing so

47:30.960 --> 47:32.960
many other terrible things.

47:32.960 --> 47:36.000
Number one, doing eight podcasts every day.

47:36.000 --> 47:36.320
Yeah.

47:36.320 --> 47:39.920
Like that's taking a pretty hefty toll on my spirit.

47:41.520 --> 47:44.160
Um, I'll see, I mean, we could all eat healthier.

47:48.000 --> 47:54.160
I was eating, I was eating turkey bacon at breakfast with dad and Justin during LA Podfest

47:54.160 --> 47:57.120
and they looked at me like I was fucking on fire.

47:57.120 --> 47:58.160
What are you, what?

47:58.160 --> 48:02.400
That's some really good bacon there though.

48:02.400 --> 48:04.560
It had a rich smoky flavor.

48:04.560 --> 48:06.080
I enjoy a turkey bacon.

48:06.080 --> 48:06.880
There, I said it.

48:06.880 --> 48:07.600
I enjoy it too.

48:07.600 --> 48:08.400
Not like this.

48:08.400 --> 48:09.360
This looked terrible.

48:09.360 --> 48:11.280
This was like, this looked like meat by the foot.

48:11.280 --> 48:13.040
It was meat by the foot.

48:13.040 --> 48:13.280
Yeah.

48:14.160 --> 48:16.640
That's six feet of meat for you.

48:16.640 --> 48:17.040
Not this.

48:17.040 --> 48:19.040
These were pork roll ups is what these were.

48:19.040 --> 48:19.280
Yeah.

48:19.280 --> 48:21.280
And they were, they weren't even pork though.

48:21.280 --> 48:22.160
They were a nightmare.

48:23.200 --> 48:24.000
Gristle tape.

48:24.000 --> 48:25.200
They were gristle tape.

48:25.200 --> 48:26.080
Do you guys want to Yahoo?

48:26.800 --> 48:27.360
Uh, sure.

48:27.360 --> 48:28.160
Yeah.

48:29.200 --> 48:29.680
Which ones?

48:29.680 --> 48:30.560
Good for you, by the way.

48:30.560 --> 48:31.920
I meant, we should have mentioned that earlier.

48:31.920 --> 48:33.520
Yeah, I'm sorry to be such dicks about it.

48:33.520 --> 48:39.120
Like honestly, I drink an unhealthy amount of coffee and it's going to make my fucking bones disintegrate.

48:39.120 --> 48:40.160
It's going to nothing.

48:40.160 --> 48:41.360
It's going to rule.

48:41.360 --> 48:45.360
It's going to give you a great bowel movement in about 15 minutes.

48:45.360 --> 48:45.680
Yeah.

48:46.320 --> 48:46.560
Yeah.

48:47.440 --> 48:49.520
Here's a Yahoo sent in by Zoe Kinski climbing that ladder.

48:49.520 --> 48:50.240
Zoe Kinski, thank you.

48:50.240 --> 48:50.880
It's by Yahoo.

48:50.880 --> 48:59.360
Answers user Mayda B who asks, do all people who get LASIK eye surgery see ghosts?

49:00.560 --> 49:05.120
My, my brother's getting one and I am afraid he might see ghosts.

49:05.120 --> 49:07.120
Update LASIK with a K.

49:07.120 --> 49:10.400
Sorry, they misspelled LASIK in the title, but then they fucking got it.

49:11.120 --> 49:11.840
Update two.

49:12.480 --> 49:14.560
They laughed at something somebody said.

49:14.560 --> 49:15.040
So.

49:15.040 --> 49:16.160
Update two.

49:16.160 --> 49:16.720
Yes.

49:16.720 --> 49:17.600
Yes is the answer.

49:17.600 --> 49:24.720
Do, do, do now, now, now do all people who get LASIK eye surgery see ghosts?

49:24.720 --> 49:25.680
What percentage?

49:25.680 --> 49:27.280
What is the, what's the spread?

49:27.280 --> 49:31.840
What's the vaguest odds on whether or not this LASIK will give us ghost vision?

49:32.400 --> 49:35.680
It sounds to me like this person heard of the movie The Eye.

49:37.040 --> 49:41.280
But did not trouble themselves to go see it in theaters or on DVD or Blu-ray.

49:41.280 --> 49:49.200
And so I feel like the question should be worded, does getting LASIK-

49:49.200 --> 49:49.840
Yeah, do any.

49:49.840 --> 49:54.160
Has there ever been a single time in recorded history that the movie The Eye happened in

49:54.160 --> 49:56.560
real life, except that that's not what happened in The Eye.

49:56.560 --> 49:57.040
And The Eye wasn't like-

49:57.040 --> 50:00.560
But not the fear of like, can I do just this once?

50:00.560 --> 50:03.520
Can I get LASIK and not see a fucking ghost for once?

50:03.520 --> 50:04.640
For once, please.

50:05.440 --> 50:06.880
I'm so tired.

50:06.880 --> 50:08.960
What if you only see it in one eye?

50:08.960 --> 50:14.480
What if you get LASIK and just odds like one eye sees ghosts and one eye does not?

50:15.360 --> 50:18.800
So that would be sweet because you would be able to walk around with an eye patch and

50:18.800 --> 50:19.920
people would be like, what's up with that?

50:19.920 --> 50:22.800
And you're like, ugh, don't get me started.

50:22.800 --> 50:26.240
But you would have horrible depth perception and keep walking into ghosts.

50:26.240 --> 50:29.600
I'd have horrible depth perception, but you'd have great depth perception.

50:29.600 --> 50:30.320
That's a good one.

50:31.840 --> 50:32.160
Write that one down.

50:32.160 --> 50:33.200
Okay, I'm tired, I'm gonna lie down.

50:33.200 --> 50:34.800
Send it into humor in uniform.

50:34.800 --> 50:37.600
Humor in uniform?

50:37.600 --> 50:39.040
I don't think it would fit in.

50:39.680 --> 50:41.120
No, because it wasn't-

50:41.120 --> 50:44.400
No, but it was the only magazine I could think of that might take the-

50:44.400 --> 50:45.280
Playboy?

50:45.280 --> 50:46.640
I don't know, not a big joke.

50:46.640 --> 50:50.800
While humor in uniform is in a magazine, it would be a segment in Reader's Digest.

50:50.800 --> 50:53.840
I think what you're looking for is Justin's Say the Darnedest Thing.

50:53.840 --> 50:57.200
Yeah, it's a section of Reader's Digest that's in that tier.

50:58.240 --> 51:02.480
I have a bit of a lazy eye in my partially blind eye.

51:02.480 --> 51:04.880
Is that because there's a fucking ghost in there?

51:04.880 --> 51:06.000
Just starting to knock on them.

51:06.000 --> 51:08.080
Maybe you just saw too many ghosts and it burned it out.

51:08.080 --> 51:08.800
That's possible.

51:09.920 --> 51:11.200
Do you remember any ghosts, Griffin?

51:11.200 --> 51:12.000
Close your eyes.

51:12.000 --> 51:12.880
Sorry, it got real.

51:13.440 --> 51:15.360
Did you see a ghost inside your eyelid?

51:15.360 --> 51:15.600
Yeah.

51:15.600 --> 51:16.880
It just, shh!

51:16.880 --> 51:19.680
Yeah, he's in there.

51:19.680 --> 51:21.120
What if, in order to-

51:21.120 --> 51:27.200
Like, when you close your eyes, you saw ghosts, and there was just one ghost that lived in

51:27.200 --> 51:28.640
your eyes when you closed your eyes.

51:28.640 --> 51:30.240
Can you imagine trying to go to sleep?

51:30.240 --> 51:31.520
What?

51:31.520 --> 51:32.560
Jesus, Justin.

51:33.360 --> 51:35.920
Justin, you just wrote a Yahoo Answers question.

51:35.920 --> 51:38.240
You just wrote a fucking heroin trip.

51:39.680 --> 51:41.680
What if there were ghosts in your eyes?

51:41.680 --> 51:45.840
What if you read these two-sentence ghost stories and you won't sleep tonight?

51:45.840 --> 51:50.480
Is the laser that they use in LASIK eye surgery just concentrated ghosts?

51:51.280 --> 51:52.000
Is that all?

51:52.000 --> 51:53.120
It's powered by ghosts.

51:53.120 --> 51:53.920
Open it up.

51:53.920 --> 51:54.960
It's a ghost prison in there.

51:54.960 --> 51:56.240
Is that all that lasers are?

51:56.240 --> 52:00.640
Because that would make the Star Wars movies pretty fucking spooky, if you ask me.

52:00.640 --> 52:07.200
Is the laser from LASIK just a proton pack that they shrunk down, and it was originally

52:07.200 --> 52:11.040
used to capture ghosts, but instead, like, summons them?

52:11.040 --> 52:15.760
Wouldn't that be a horrible revelation from Ghostbusters that the technology they use

52:15.760 --> 52:19.040
to trap ghosts is powered by, like, ground-up ghosts?

52:19.040 --> 52:19.520
Oh, fuck.

52:19.520 --> 52:20.400
That's sick.

52:21.680 --> 52:23.360
That's fucking sick.

52:23.360 --> 52:25.200
That's fucking disgusting.

52:25.200 --> 52:28.320
You should be ashamed of yourself, Egon.

52:28.320 --> 52:30.720
That's my memaw that you're blasting out there.

52:31.600 --> 52:35.040
You ground up my memaw to turn her into a laser beam.

52:35.040 --> 52:37.680
You use my memaw to catch my people, you dick.

52:37.680 --> 52:38.880
Hold up.

52:38.880 --> 52:39.520
Wait a minute.

52:40.960 --> 52:45.040
When I die, if I could get the option to be ground up and turn into a laser beam, that

52:45.040 --> 52:47.440
is absolutely what I would want to be.

52:47.440 --> 52:48.080
Are you kidding me?

52:48.080 --> 52:49.760
That would be sweet, yeah.

52:49.760 --> 52:54.480
Maybe they didn't figure out a way to power their weapons with ground-up ghosts.

52:54.480 --> 52:57.440
Maybe they found a way to power themselves with ground-up ghosts.

52:58.160 --> 53:05.040
By which I mean, they accidentally ate a ghost once and just, like, got the fever.

53:05.600 --> 53:08.240
And even before the Ghostbusters and stuff-

53:08.240 --> 53:09.680
A Pac-Man fever?

53:10.240 --> 53:11.360
Because he eats ghosts.

53:11.360 --> 53:13.520
Pac-Man fever, yes.

53:13.520 --> 53:14.080
Count it.

53:14.080 --> 53:15.920
Griffin say the darndest things.

53:15.920 --> 53:17.680
Page 34 of the New Reader's Digest.

53:17.680 --> 53:18.240
Check it out.

53:19.360 --> 53:20.800
What if they eat ghosts?

53:20.800 --> 53:22.480
Like, what if that's what, like, when you-

53:22.480 --> 53:26.080
If you were to sneak up on the Ghostbusters during off-hours, you would see them sitting

53:26.080 --> 53:28.000
down to a big plate of ghosts.

53:29.440 --> 53:30.240
That's horrible.

53:31.200 --> 53:32.080
I hate that.

53:32.080 --> 53:32.720
I hate it too.

53:34.240 --> 53:37.040
But the good news is, we've done an hour.

53:37.840 --> 53:39.040
Yes!

53:39.040 --> 53:39.920
We made it!

53:40.560 --> 53:41.360
Folks, listen.

53:43.600 --> 53:44.400
Fuck me.

53:44.400 --> 53:45.920
I hope this episode is okay.

53:45.920 --> 53:47.520
Folks, it's, like, not a joke.

53:47.520 --> 53:50.640
We have completely overbooked ourselves for the month of September.

53:50.640 --> 53:54.320
Not just with podcast stuff, but with, like, a bunch of live stuff too.

53:55.040 --> 53:57.280
But thank you for sticking with us.

53:58.080 --> 53:59.120
You've all been really cool.

53:59.120 --> 54:02.240
I know it sucks when we put up episodes late and they're delayed and stuff.

54:02.240 --> 54:04.400
Like, we don't enjoy doing it either.

54:04.400 --> 54:07.280
But you guys have been pretty chill about it and really understanding.

54:07.280 --> 54:08.320
I promise we'll get back to it.

54:08.320 --> 54:09.520
We'll get back to it.

54:09.520 --> 54:10.720
Things are gonna calm down.

54:10.720 --> 54:15.440
Have we even talked about the Switcheroo episode that's coming up in October, what, 5th?

54:16.320 --> 54:16.880
That Monday?

54:17.760 --> 54:18.560
Yeah, that week.

54:18.560 --> 54:23.200
For that week, as a Max Fun special event, all of the shows on the Max Fun Network are

54:23.200 --> 54:23.920
switching shows.

54:24.480 --> 54:27.920
So, uh, the Adventure Zone is swapping with the Flophouse.

54:28.880 --> 54:30.320
We're doing each other's shows that week.

54:30.320 --> 54:31.200
That'll be real fun.

54:32.880 --> 54:35.840
And my brother and my brother and me is switching with Jordan Jesse Goh.

54:36.560 --> 54:37.920
And are you ready for this?

54:38.640 --> 54:44.720
The three hosts of my brother and my brother and me that week, Dave Holmes, Cameron Esposito,

54:44.720 --> 54:45.520
and Jesse Thorne.

54:45.520 --> 54:47.200
So we're fucked, basically.

54:47.200 --> 54:49.680
Because we're gonna come back and people will be like, where did the...

54:50.560 --> 54:51.120
Where the fuck?

54:51.120 --> 54:54.240
Where did the confident, beautiful, hilarious people go?

54:54.240 --> 54:54.800
What happened?

54:55.360 --> 54:57.200
Now I'm back with these three goblins.

54:58.640 --> 55:00.240
But anyway, that's gonna be real fun.

55:00.240 --> 55:02.480
You can hear us that week over on Jordan Jesse Goh.

55:02.480 --> 55:03.520
And then here...

55:03.520 --> 55:04.240
What are you guys?

55:04.880 --> 55:08.640
Sawbones is swapping with Ono, Ross, and Kerry.

55:08.640 --> 55:10.080
Bunker Buddies, who are y'all?

55:10.080 --> 55:12.000
Bunker Buddies is doing Baby Geniuses.

55:12.000 --> 55:13.360
That'll be fun.

55:13.360 --> 55:19.440
And then... Oh, and Baby Geniuses is doing Lady 2 Lady.

55:19.440 --> 55:20.960
Oh, so a little triangle swap there.

55:21.600 --> 55:21.840
Yeah.

55:21.840 --> 55:22.720
That'll be fun.

55:22.720 --> 55:24.000
Anyway, it's gonna be a fun week.

55:24.000 --> 55:26.240
That's October 5th is the...

55:26.240 --> 55:26.960
When I think the...

55:26.960 --> 55:28.160
When the Mabim Bam's going up.

55:29.680 --> 55:30.160
So yeah.

55:31.920 --> 55:33.200
It's gonna be a crazy game of poker.

55:33.200 --> 55:35.440
It's gonna be a crazy game of poker, but then things are gonna calm down.

55:37.840 --> 55:39.920
We've never done as many live shows as we've done this year.

55:39.920 --> 55:42.720
We've done a pretty ridiculous amount of live shows this year for us.

55:42.720 --> 55:46.000
Not for, you know, like normal...

55:46.000 --> 55:50.000
When we plan on doing those live shows, we said, you know, at the beginning of this year, like,

55:50.000 --> 55:53.600
guys, we have to get out there and do more shows and get on the road.

55:53.600 --> 56:01.760
What we didn't really consider is, like, we use those same human bodies to do the podcast every

56:01.760 --> 56:02.480
week, right?

56:02.480 --> 56:03.520
So we can't...

56:03.520 --> 56:04.160
We're not like...

56:04.160 --> 56:05.440
We didn't do clones.

56:05.440 --> 56:09.120
We can't, like, you know, partition that off.

56:09.120 --> 56:11.440
Like, we have to use these same bodies to do all of it.

56:11.440 --> 56:11.840
Yeah.

56:11.840 --> 56:12.640
That's right, Justin.

56:12.640 --> 56:14.080
So someone could invent surrogates.

56:14.080 --> 56:15.440
That would be so dope.

56:15.440 --> 56:16.720
Anyway, thank you.

56:16.720 --> 56:18.960
I'm not completely non-complaining about how successful we are.

56:18.960 --> 56:20.400
I'm not complaining about how successful we are.

56:20.400 --> 56:23.600
I'm saying, like, I know it's been, like, weird.

56:23.600 --> 56:23.920
Not weird, but...

56:23.920 --> 56:25.840
I'm just taking ownership of the fact that we've, like...

56:26.640 --> 56:27.440
That it's hard.

56:27.440 --> 56:28.720
There's, like, a lot of...

56:28.720 --> 56:31.840
Like, we're trying to keep a lot of plates spinning, and there's just three of us,

56:31.840 --> 56:38.800
and we're doing our fucking best, and we're so appreciative to you for continuing to listen

56:38.800 --> 56:42.640
and hang in there with us and be so, like, cool and enthusiastic about everything,

56:42.640 --> 56:43.440
because it's, like...

56:43.440 --> 56:44.560
It's all fun stuff.

56:44.560 --> 56:47.440
I just never want, like, you know, the...

56:47.440 --> 56:52.480
You, the Bim Bambinos, the originals, the listeners, like...

56:52.480 --> 56:54.320
You guys are always going to be our number one fan.

56:54.880 --> 57:00.160
I would like to give you guys a reward for sticking with us and for being so cool,

57:00.160 --> 57:00.880
and it is this.

57:02.000 --> 57:07.280
Our buddy, Emmanuel Miranda, they're streaming Hamilton the Musical.

57:07.280 --> 57:11.360
You can listen to the entire cast recording right now.

57:12.080 --> 57:12.640
I'm gonna...

57:12.640 --> 57:13.040
If you just...

57:13.040 --> 57:13.440
I'm actually...

57:13.440 --> 57:14.480
Like, just basically...

57:14.480 --> 57:15.280
Just Google it.

57:15.280 --> 57:15.440
Yeah.

57:15.440 --> 57:18.400
Just Google, like, Hamilton live stream, and you can, like, listen.

57:18.400 --> 57:18.800
It's good.

57:18.800 --> 57:22.000
You know I've been bumping that shit all day, but what I will say is,

57:22.000 --> 57:24.480
if you haven't seen the show, I'll actually tell you not to do it.

57:24.480 --> 57:26.720
Not till you can go see it and enjoy it in person,

57:26.720 --> 57:30.800
and then you have earned the right to enjoy it with your ear holes,

57:30.800 --> 57:31.680
because you missed a lot.

57:31.680 --> 57:33.040
There's a lot of good choreography.

57:33.040 --> 57:35.680
Also, you should stream it and buy it.

57:35.680 --> 57:36.560
You should buy it on iTunes.

57:36.560 --> 57:37.600
Buy it, but don't listen to it.

57:37.600 --> 57:38.960
Buy it, but save it for yourself.

57:39.520 --> 57:43.840
But if you do listen to it, there's a secret My Brother, My Brother and Me goof in there.

57:43.840 --> 57:45.120
Yeah, that's pretty wonderful.

57:45.120 --> 57:46.560
Arguably one and a half.

57:47.120 --> 57:48.640
Yes, the judges are still out.

57:49.200 --> 57:50.080
The judges are still out.

57:50.080 --> 57:52.400
There's definitely one that you will definitely get.

57:52.400 --> 57:57.120
We also want to thank everybody who came out to watch L.A. Podfest and everybody who joined.

57:57.120 --> 57:57.920
Y'all, it was a fun...

57:57.920 --> 57:59.600
It was exhausting, but it was a fun fucking weekend.

57:59.600 --> 58:00.800
We just basically...

58:00.800 --> 58:05.840
It was us doing shows and fucking kicking it with Tim and Guy from Worst Idea of All Time,

58:05.840 --> 58:07.120
who are the coolest dudes.

58:07.680 --> 58:08.240
It was great.

58:08.240 --> 58:11.360
And we know that there were some issues with the live stream, and we're sorry.

58:11.360 --> 58:12.560
We had no control.

58:12.560 --> 58:13.760
We had literally no...

58:13.760 --> 58:15.920
It was just frustrating for us being up on stage,

58:15.920 --> 58:19.600
seeing people on Twitter talk about how they couldn't get access to this thing.

58:19.600 --> 58:21.840
They had bought a ticket for it and played an event around it.

58:21.840 --> 58:23.600
I know it sucks, and we're...

58:23.600 --> 58:27.760
It will still be up on the archives, though, even though it didn't work on the weekend.

58:27.760 --> 58:30.480
So you still do get a chance to see it, even though it's not live.

58:31.360 --> 58:34.640
I think for the audio for that one and for Adventure Zone,

58:34.640 --> 58:41.920
we're just going to put up as a donor bonus instead of just putting it up in the regular feed.

58:44.000 --> 58:48.800
So if you're a MaxFun donor, that'll just pop up eventually once we get the audio from it.

58:48.800 --> 58:49.440
It's weird.

58:49.440 --> 58:53.520
There are certain restrictions what we can do with it because it wasn't our thing.

58:53.520 --> 58:54.800
It was part of the festival.

58:54.800 --> 58:57.920
So I think that might be what we have to do with it.

58:57.920 --> 59:01.120
Yes, but we'll figure out something, but just bear with us.

59:01.120 --> 59:03.520
Check out all the other amazing MaxFun shows.

59:03.520 --> 59:06.640
As we said, coming up in two weeks is going to be the Switcheroo episode.

59:06.640 --> 59:09.040
So you may want to start kind of preparing yourself.

59:09.040 --> 59:11.680
Check out all the other shows that you haven't checked out yet.

59:11.680 --> 59:12.880
Why haven't you checked them out yet?

59:12.880 --> 59:13.680
They're all very good.

59:15.520 --> 59:17.920
And thanks to John Roderick in the Long Winter's Feast for a theme song

59:17.920 --> 59:20.080
instead of Parchoff, the album putting the days to bed.

59:20.080 --> 59:20.880
It's a great album.

59:20.880 --> 59:23.280
Oh, I have one more thing.

59:24.160 --> 59:26.480
We did a My Brother, My Brother, Me Fantasy Football League.

59:26.480 --> 59:28.560
It's me and like 11 other really awesome people.

59:28.560 --> 59:32.960
And I started a podcast to update if that's something you might be interested in.

59:32.960 --> 59:35.680
If you want to hear Travis talk about his fantasy football teams

59:35.680 --> 59:37.040
in a league you're not a part of.

59:37.760 --> 59:39.920
If that's a thing that you might be interested in,

59:39.920 --> 59:42.080
it's the My Brother, My Brother, Me Fantasy Football League.

59:42.080 --> 59:43.600
It's on iTunes now.

59:43.600 --> 59:44.480
I don't know.

59:44.480 --> 59:47.280
We do like Tuesday and Wednesday episodes.

59:47.280 --> 59:47.840
I don't know.

59:47.840 --> 59:49.600
Maybe check that out if you want to.

59:49.600 --> 59:50.080
It's not.

59:50.080 --> 59:51.280
You say we, it's you.

59:51.280 --> 59:52.480
It's just, it's just me.

59:52.480 --> 59:52.960
Yeah, it's me.

59:53.520 --> 59:54.080
It's me.

59:54.080 --> 59:56.160
So like, I don't know if you want to.

59:56.160 --> 59:57.760
The show should just be called My Brother.

59:59.120 --> 01:00:02.080
Well, I tried to get you on it, Griffin, but you have informed me

01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:02.720
you do not care about fantasy football.

01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:04.080
Yeah, don't give a fuck, dog.

01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:06.960
Don't give a fuck because I beat your ass.

01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:07.440
All right.

01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:11.120
Well, this episode is gonna come to an end now.

01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:13.280
Thanks to Matt Gifford who sent in this Yahoo.

01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:13.760
Thank you, Matt.

01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:15.040
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:16.320
Sorry, something has gone wrong.

01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:17.840
I'm gonna call him Broccoli Bill.

01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:22.320
Broccoli Bill asks,

01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:27.280
when did the phrase get jiggy with it become extinct?

01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:31.040
My name's Justin McElroy.

01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:31.840
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:33.120
I'm Broccoli Bill.

01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:35.440
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:36.480
Kiss your dads.

01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:37.280
Wear on the lips.

01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:56.640

01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:01.440
Welcome to Oh No, Ross and Carrie.

01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:01.920
Ross.

01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:02.400
Hi, Carrie.

01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:04.080
What do you think is creepier?

01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:04.560
Okay.

01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:07.360
You jump into a swimming pool.

01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:10.640
All of a sudden, the water goes away and instead of water,

01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:15.680
there is the bones of your dead ancestors or our show.

01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:19.120
That's pretty tough because we visited a live exorcism.

01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:23.040
We joined the Ordo Templi Orientis where we had to worship a naked lady.

01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:24.880
Oh, and we joined that Tony Olomo cult.

01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:25.840
They were scary.

01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:26.560
Super creepy.

01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:28.320
We joined the Ethere Society.

01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:29.920
We joined the Ethere Society.

01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:32.160
We tried penis enlargement, or at least I did.

01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:32.560
Oh, boy.

01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:33.760
I tried breast enlargement.

01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:36.400
We have basically done every creepy,

01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:39.600
weird, fringe thing except for thousands more,

01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:41.440
which we will get to if you listen to our show.

01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:44.160
I'd still say the swimming pool with my ancestors' bones.

01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:45.920
Well, then I don't even know if people should listen.

01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:46.720
I guess they shouldn't.

01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:49.280
But if you want to, we're at Maximum Fun,

01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:58.880
and the show's called Anna, Ross, and Carrie.
