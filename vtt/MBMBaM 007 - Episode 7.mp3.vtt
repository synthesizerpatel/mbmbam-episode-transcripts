WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
If you change your mind, I'm the first in line Honey, I'm still free, take a chance on me

00:09.000 --> 00:19.000
If you need me, let me know, I'm gonna be around If you got no place to go when you're feeling down

00:19.000 --> 00:24.000
If you're all alone, when the pretty birds have flown

00:24.000 --> 00:35.000
You've done it, you've succeeded, you've engaged in the right series of clicks and types and taps that make the

00:35.000 --> 00:45.000
My Brother, My Brother and Me Advice Show for the Modern Era come out of your speakers or headphones or cans with string

00:45.000 --> 00:51.000
I am, of course, Justin McElroy, I am the oldest McElroy brother

00:51.000 --> 00:55.000
I am Travis McElroy and I am the middle-est McElroy brother

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
You can't get more middle than Travis

00:57.000 --> 01:01.000
I'm Griffin McElroy and I'm the adopted McElroy brother

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
I was gonna bring it up this episode if you didn't

01:04.000 --> 01:08.000
So, real brother, thank you for joining me again

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
No problem

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
Adopted brother, you didn't have much of a choice

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
Right, you'd put me back in the cellar

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
Back to the cellar with you, dum-dum

01:17.000 --> 01:21.000
Words hurt, words hurt

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
Words do hurt

01:23.000 --> 01:27.000
Our first question comes to us from FormSpring

01:27.000 --> 01:31.000
If you need advice, you can find out how to get it at the end of the program

01:31.000 --> 01:37.000
Dear MBMBAM, have you ever fallen in love with a girl for her taste in music?

01:37.000 --> 01:42.000
A girl started making me mix CDs that were surprising and addictingly good

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
And now I am in love, but maybe just because of the mix

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
I ask, is there anything wrong with this?

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
There ain't nothing wrong with a music girlfriend

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
Not in the short term, my man

01:52.000 --> 01:56.000
Yeah, that ain't gonna last long, but you can get some sweet burn CDs from them

01:56.000 --> 02:01.000
Most of my collegiate musical taste came from a girlfriend that I had my freshman year of college

02:01.000 --> 02:05.000
That burned me like four MP3 CDs, not even audio CDs

02:05.000 --> 02:10.000
We're talking like Googles and Googles of music that I still listen to to this day

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
Wait, Googles?

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
Google Bits

02:13.000 --> 02:18.000
It's not gonna last long unless the song that unites the two of you is Crazy Game of Poker

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
Because man, that song never ends

02:21.000 --> 02:26.000
Once again, this is one of those questions where if you're in high school, yeah, no, that's perfectly fine

02:26.000 --> 02:30.000
If you're 45, it's time to get your ass together, man

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
Yeah

02:32.000 --> 02:36.000
I don't think there's anything wrong with judging a person based on their musical taste

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
I think that says a lot about a person

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
I think everybody has that quality

02:39.000 --> 02:46.000
For me, it's TV shows and movies, and I think for other people it's like video games and music and books and magazines

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
There's always gonna be that one thing that sparks our interest

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
Just build off of that

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
For me, it's Pogs

02:53.000 --> 02:59.000
I find a lady with a fine collection of Pogs and maybe some really heavy alloy Slammers

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
Just some really nice Slammers

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
Look at the Slammers on her

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
Wow, look at her Slammers

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
Is that a Digimon on there? Nice

03:06.000 --> 03:12.000
So in closing, it's a fine reason to start a relationship and a terrible reason to continue one

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
There it is

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
That's great

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
Another one from FormSpring

03:15.000 --> 03:25.000
If you work someplace that lets you interact with many different people, customers, and you're immediately attracted to one of them, is it cool to tell him or her you think they're attractive?

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
No

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
What's up with those Slammers, girl?

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
I like those Slammers I see across the register

03:31.000 --> 03:35.000
I'm gonna have to go with Travis on this one, no

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
There's no way to avoid being that dude

03:38.000 --> 03:47.000
Even if you're the nicest guy in the world, there's no way when you're wearing khakis and your work shirt to not sound creepy

03:47.000 --> 03:52.000
Are you gonna say you're attractive? Because that's probably creepy

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
But if you're saying it with body language and stuff

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
You just need this, Alpo? Do you want me to put it in your bag?

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
You're attractive

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
You're attractive

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
I like your face

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
I'm attracted to you

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
I'm attracted to you

04:03.000 --> 04:09.000
Your body, your face is setting off chemical reactions inside of my body that find you very desirable

04:09.000 --> 04:13.000
My aesthetic sense is inflamed

04:13.000 --> 04:21.000
It's one of those things where if you're just paying a compliment, great, it ain't going anywhere

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
But you might make them feel better

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
Maybe you can use that to get ahead in your business, right?

04:25.000 --> 04:31.000
Like if you're a real estate agent, maybe show a little bit of the cleave and then what's up?

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
Yeah, what's up?

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
Okay, confession time

04:34.000 --> 04:41.000
I once asked a girl out when I was working a waiter job and I asked her out via Facebook

04:41.000 --> 04:46.000
We went out once and it was awful

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
It was quite terrible

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
Sounds bad

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
Yeah, so I personally don't recommend it

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
Also, I felt like the creepiest creepo ever

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
You should have

04:56.000 --> 05:01.000
Yeah, and I did, even as I did it, I was trying to justify it and you can't

05:01.000 --> 05:06.000
I'm surprised the girl showed up and didn't just call Chris Hansen because it's creepy time

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
Because she was 12 years old

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
She was also 12

05:10.000 --> 05:14.000
This is also like so much of our advice

05:14.000 --> 05:20.000
It's highly contextual dependent upon whether or not you yourself are very physically attractive

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
Oh yeah, no, if you're banging, forget it

05:22.000 --> 05:30.000
Yeah, if you're super attractive, super handsome dude or a super bodacious lady with just real nice slammers

05:30.000 --> 05:36.000
You are always going to be on the right path by telling people that you find them attractive

05:36.000 --> 05:40.000
It's always acceptable if you're very, very physically attractive

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
Sweet, sweet slammers

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
Just the sweetest

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
Hi brothers

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
Hi

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
Hi, I have a problem

05:47.000 --> 05:51.000
I can't start studying for a test until the day before

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
What should I do to start earlier?

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
You've come to the wrong place, my friend

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
How about this, hey bitch, just start earlier

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
Just do the thing

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
Do the thing you asked how to do

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
Let's do that

06:04.000 --> 06:11.000
You understand the concept of earlier, so pick a time before the time you normally do it and do it then

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
Don't do it now, do it yesterday

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
If you do it now, it's too late, do it before

06:15.000 --> 06:27.000
Now that being said, I do the same thing or I did the same thing because I retained the knowledge better in a block before the test rather than trying to study all week

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
Bullshit

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
I couldn't hold it in my head that long

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
Bullshit

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
No, I sort of got it

06:32.000 --> 06:39.000
The only thing I think you can do which proved to be kind of useful for me was to get like a, I don't want to say study group

06:39.000 --> 06:49.000
Because that's not the right vernacular, but like a shared pain group who will guilt you if you don't study

06:49.000 --> 06:54.000
Yeah, the hardest class I had growing up was theater history and I actually had a study group for that one

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
And I felt like pretty lame about it

06:56.000 --> 06:59.000
That's why I should have a study group, what is it, 1930?

06:59.000 --> 07:02.000
But that worked out well for me

07:02.000 --> 07:10.000
So if you get somebody who will say, like if you make a study appointment with somebody like a few days before, say hey we're going to study on Tuesday, let's just study

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
Then you will keep that appointment

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
Sure

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
In theory

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
Got to get accountability is what that's called

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
Yeah

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
Got to be accountable

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
Got to get that

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
Yahoo Answers user Rock just says

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
Hey Rock

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
That's spelled R-A-Q by the way

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
Whoa

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
I'm figuring that's how it prefers to be pronounced

07:31.000 --> 07:35.000
Hey, need a film, not anything like The Lake House or that sort

07:35.000 --> 07:41.000
Desperate for something to watch, anything for a 15 year old girl?

07:41.000 --> 07:47.000
But not in the wheelhouse of The Lake House

07:47.000 --> 07:53.000
So the only parameters set on this choice

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
Okay

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
Might I suggest The Lake House?

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
No, wait, fuck, shit

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
You choked, you choked McElroy, you choked

08:02.000 --> 08:06.000
Not The Lake House, anything but The Lake House

08:06.000 --> 08:11.000
Maybe something that, maybe Walk in the Clouds?

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
Maybe

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
That's got Keanu

08:13.000 --> 08:19.000
I'm thinking of, I'm trying to think of other Keanu Reeves time travel based rom coms

08:19.000 --> 08:24.000
Oh, Bill and Ted's Excellent Love Affair

08:24.000 --> 08:29.000
Bill and Ted's most tender engagement

08:29.000 --> 08:36.000
Travel through time, kissing George Carlin

08:36.000 --> 08:40.000
This question is troubling to me because of the addendum

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
I'm desperate for something different to watch

08:42.000 --> 08:47.000
Which makes me think, this is a 15 year old girl who her entire life

08:47.000 --> 08:51.000
The only film she's ever watched is The Lake House

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
I'm ready for something new

08:53.000 --> 08:58.000
I would say the Jurassic Park films, that would probably be a good place to start

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
Have you tried Titanic?

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
You've never seen any movies, I don't know where to start with you

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
Have you tried anything else?

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
Not that she hasn't seen any movies

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
She done seen The Lake House

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
Don't even try to quote Lake House to her

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
She knows all the lines, all the classic, classic lines

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
Like, I've got a time traveling mailbox

09:19.000 --> 09:22.000
I live in a house by the lake

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
That really is the worst movie ever

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
You've watched it?

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
Yeah, I watched it

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
Oh, that's good

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
I'm sorry

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
I hate you

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
Another one from FormSpring

09:35.000 --> 09:39.000
I fall in love with every girl that pays attention to me, is this normal?

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
If you're fat

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
Fair

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
I mean, right?

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
I don't know, I get it

09:48.000 --> 09:57.000
If you've been single for long enough, I don't think that's such a ridiculous feature

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
It was actually something I just learned in the last year

09:59.000 --> 10:05.000
To not view every female that I meet as a potential love interest

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
Right now?

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
Yeah, just like a year ago

10:09.000 --> 10:13.000
Sometimes you can just meet and be friends with a girl

10:13.000 --> 10:17.000
And you don't have to be romantically involved

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
It's really freeing

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
Yeah, you can't do that

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
But I see what you're getting at

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
Maybe you've never seen a film called When Harry Met Sally

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
Or The Lake House

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
That's all I've seen

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
That might be a good one

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
Go see When Harry Met Sally

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
Billy Crystals

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
You say Billy Crystals?

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
I don't think you should

10:40.000 --> 10:44.000
I don't think you should fall in love with every girl that pays attention to you anymore

10:44.000 --> 10:48.000
That's my advice

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
Because it's not healthy

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
No, it's not healthy

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
It's a losers game

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
You're a worthwhile person

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
You have great taste in podcasts

10:58.000 --> 11:02.000
You don't need to fall in love with every girl that pays attention to you

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
And also look at it this way

11:04.000 --> 11:07.000
If you fall in love with every girl that pays attention to you

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
You will be less desirable to women

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
Because they don't want that dude

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
They want someone who is funny and aloof

11:14.000 --> 11:18.000
And not desperately trying to get the attention of every woman that pays attention to him

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
So, you know, play it cool, hotshot

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
Play it cool

11:22.000 --> 11:26.000
I've got a bad problem of falling in love with every girl that's pretty on my TV box

11:26.000 --> 11:30.000
Every girl I see on my TV box that I think is pretty

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
Just instant infatuation

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
Like Lauren Bacall

11:34.000 --> 11:38.000
Flo, Flo from the Instagram

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
Don't get me started

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
Flo, those progressive commercials

11:42.000 --> 11:46.000
She's my favorite

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
She is a cutie

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
And you know she's got the N for insurance

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
She can hook you up

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
I mean, C.E. Wilson

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
I mean, I guess he's a good enough looking man

11:56.000 --> 12:00.000
But I would hop onto the Flo wagon

12:00.000 --> 12:04.000
You would with very little hesitation be a Flo rider

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
Oh

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
Wow, from downtown

12:08.000 --> 12:14.000
My wife and I are expecting first child in a month

12:14.000 --> 12:18.000
She wants some songs that would be good to listen to in the delivery room

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
Can you give me some great tracks for this special occasion?

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
That's from Thomas via Gmail

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
No, I think we could come up with something, Thomas

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
Oh man, Zees

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
I actually, I read this question earlier

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
And I came up with a really great solution

12:30.000 --> 12:34.000
And I think for the longer portion

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
The more drawn out portion

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
Like from when she actually gets posted up in the room

12:38.000 --> 12:42.000
And starts squishing out the baby

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
You put on something soothing

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
Something mellow

12:46.000 --> 12:50.000
Something like Iron and Wine's double sided LP around the well

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
Just something to bring the mood down

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
And then

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
And then

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
Right when she starts crowning

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
Thunderstruck by ACDC

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
Wow

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
See, I was going along the same idea

13:04.000 --> 13:08.000
India, Nazareth, Hair of the Dog

13:08.000 --> 13:12.000
Now you're messing with a son of a bitch

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
I think that's the best way for a baby to enter the world

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
How did that go again?

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
I don't want to do that again

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
I don't think he can do better than Thunderstruck

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
Like if you guys want to try and come at me with something else

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
But Thunderstruck would be the most trial

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
How about with Arms Wide Open by Creed?

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
Fuck you with that

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
It's about bringing a baby into the world, it's perfect

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
Get out of here with that, get off the show

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
Fuck you with that

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
The obvious answer by the way

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
For the special moment of childbirth

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
Is Black Hole Sun

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
Oh man

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
What about

13:44.000 --> 13:48.000
What kid wouldn't want to make a triumphant entrance

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
To Hurricane 2000

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
Obviously

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
Hurricane 2000 is the way to go

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
Is that the

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
What am I thinking

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
I was thinking of the orchestral version

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
Of Rock You Like a Hurricane

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
That is in fact Hurricane 2000

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
That's what you're talking about?

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
That would be pretty good I guess

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
It would be perfect

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
Shake it at the knees

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
And then she would really be shaking at the knees

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
And a baby would come out

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
Thomas whatever you pick

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
Make sure you sing it to her

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
She'll really appreciate it

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
She'll really love it

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
Make sure it's with Arms Wide Open too

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
She'll dig it

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
Formspring asks, my girlfriend gets a little upset

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
That I don't tend to hug her at night

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
In bed, I explained I just need

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
My own space to get to sleep but I don't think it

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
Made her feel better, how can I keep my

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
Own bed space and avoid hurting her feelings

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
Um

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
I

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
I think that

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
You should go

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
With the, it depends on how quickly

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
She falls asleep, if she falls asleep really

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
See my wife likes to cuddle in bed

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
But I don't like to touch anything

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
I'm sleeping, so I'll like

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
Justin has a hover chamber

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
He just gets in and he just shuts down

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
For the night

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
I snuggle her until she falls asleep

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
And then I dog pound her out of that side of the bed

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
Check out my other side of the bed

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
And if I'm lucky

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
I'll have hit a real cool spot on the pillow

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
Got a real cool spot going

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
Cause I've been relocated for so long

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
What I like to do is just straight up

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
Cuddle, cuddle, cuddle and then say

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
Hey I'm going to sleep now, and then roll over

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
So she gets the cuddles and then

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
It's your turn, and it's your time

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
For sleeping

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
I've never been married so I don't know what it's like to sleep

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
In the same bed as a woman

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
That's my good boy

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
Onward Christian soldiers, onward

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
Um

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
Christian, what?

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
Yahoo

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
Yahoo answers user Mousseau

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
Which may be

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
The evil twin brother of Justin Rousseau

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
Yeah, or

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
The children's singer Mitchell Mousseau from the hit show

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
Hannah Montana

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
You know they're the same person, right?

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
Yeah, who? Hannah Montana and

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
Miley Cyrus or Justin Rousseau and Mousseau?

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
Mousseau Rousseau

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
I think it's Justin Rousseau and Hannah Montana

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
Yeah, well

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
Okay, go ahead

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
Which is a better name for a character?

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
Here's another fun little naming game

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
I'm torn between

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
Jaden and Jacob

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
Either way, his name is shortened

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
To J. My character

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
Is 15 years old and is growing up

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
In England. He comes from a

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
Middle class background yet smokes weed

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
Is a teenage Casanova

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
And basically a rebel without a cause

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
Get out of here

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
Which name would suit him better and why?

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
The only reason I didn't go for Jacob, which was

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
My first choice, was because of the

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
Werewolf character from the Twilight series

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
But my book is nothing like Twilight

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
Nothing

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
Oh

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
Basically

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
This guy's a rebel without a cause

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
More or less

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
Basically, more or less

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
Just don't get in his way

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
Mister, because you don't like Jason Jaden

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
When he's angry

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
Boy, golly

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
I like any character that's defined as

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
He's from a middle class background

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
But he smokes weed every day

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
As though those two things are mutually exclusive

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
Yeah, he's middle class

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
But you know, he'll still smoke some weed

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
He's the narcotic of the proletarians

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
What do you want him to smoke in middle class?

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
Is a middle class white guy

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
Who will

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
Wear some khakis, whatever

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
Not a big deal

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
He's a free thinker

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
I think your book sounds shitty

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
I wouldn't

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
I wouldn't read it, I don't see what the concern

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
Is with what the character's name is

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
But, to answer your question, Jaden

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
But, Jaden, obviously Jaden

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
The world has too many

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
Jasons already

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
Jacobes

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
Jason

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
Jadakiss

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
Jadakiss

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
Desiree

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
Gotta be bad, gotta be bold

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
Who's that one guy

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
Who sang with his shirt off

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
In a black and white video

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
R&B

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
Right side Fred? What are you talking about?

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
You know

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
You know

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
Not Seal

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
He had his shirt off in the Desiree video?

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
No, he's like

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
He's sort of like Desiree

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
You gotta give me a song or I can't sing

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
Kinda like Jadakiss

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
You gotta give me a song or I can't sing

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
He's an R&B singer

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
Okay, that's a genre

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
DeCantrus, maybe

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
It'll come to me

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
I wanna say something like a pony

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
Is his name

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
Jadakiss, Ludacris

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
Something like that

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
Ludacris is a thing, he's a guy

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
DeAngelo

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
Got it

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
How is that like a pony?

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
Like Capote

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
Like Capote

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
DeAngelo Capote

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
Popular district attorney in Boston

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
Can we keep going?

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
My wife and I, this comes to us from Christian

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
That's the only way I can think to pronounce that

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
For a man

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
Christian from Gmail

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
My wife and I are going to New York

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
For a week in June, would like some advice on

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
What should we do or not do

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
What was

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
Keep going

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
I can do it

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
I keep waiting for it to arrive

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
What should we

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
Should we not do, what must we do

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
See, eat, buy while we are there

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
Keep in mind, it's our first trip

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
To the US, so everything is

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
Brand spanking new to us

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
Can't imagine

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
I mean if it's

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
I think if it's

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
Your first trip to the US

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
There are more staple US activities

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
That you need to partake in before like New York

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
Activities, right?

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
First things first, buy shoes

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
We got them here

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
Lousy with them

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
Also throw some money in the garbage

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
It's what we do, we don't care

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
Get real fat

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
Buy a new like

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
Very consumptive

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
Automobile

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
And like just drive it into a building

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
Get one of those

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
Room scoot 2011's

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
They are really fast and they will just burn

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
That oil, if you want a place to go

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
To eat, try

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
Max Brenner chocolate by the bald

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
Man, there they have

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
It's not only delicious and New Yorky

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
But they have

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
A chocolate marshmallow pizza that really

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
Sums up a lot of American values

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
Welcome to America

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
Here's your complimentary diabetes

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
Yeah, I got

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
This lousy t-shirt and diabetes

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
I would say just go to the nearest

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
Walmart or Sam's Club

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
And buy a big box

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
Of Jimmy Dean's breakfast

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
Corn dogs

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
And then just eat those the entire time you're

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
Within the borders of our nation

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
Sorry, no Walmart New York

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
What?

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
No Walmart in New York

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
In all of the city there's not a single

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
Walmart

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
They would have to leave the city, they would have to take a taxi cab

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
Well maybe you could like

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
Maybe you could get one like under the counter at a Whole Foods

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
Probably yeah

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
They deal in like shady

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
Like so non Whole Foods

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
There, you gotta pay a premium

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
Talk to Jerry, the guy that sweeps up

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
He answers to the name

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
Sweepin' Jerry

21:26.000 --> 21:30.000
He's got a beat on a breakfast corn dog

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
Travis, what show

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
Do they see a show?

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
God, I wish I knew any

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
Shows on Broadway right now

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
What show gets the T-Sax seal of approval?

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
What about The Addams Family?

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
That name's always a delight

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
Is Cats still on Broadway?

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
It is, but now they changed

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
They changed the name to Miss Saigon

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
Oh, okay, but still there's

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
Cats in it, right?

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
I feel like there is something on Broadway

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
Right now that I heard about

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
And was like, oh that sounds so dope

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
But I can't

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
Like it's like a show about like a musician

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
Or something

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
Oh yeah, um, D'Angelo

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
That was it

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
Wicked

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
The Addams Family

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
The Addams Family

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
You're Googling, you make me sick

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
You know what, actually go see Blue Man Group, it's awesome

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
What?

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
That shit's incredible

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
What if they're shirtless and it's black and white

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
And they're singing R&B songs, maybe

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
And also, it's called D'Angelo the Musical

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
Um

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
So

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
Max writes to us from

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
Gmail, he's kind of a wordy

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
chap, he says

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
I've taken a real shine to a girl

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
Every 20 year old who writes our program

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
Is a 70 year old man

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
I just wanted to get that out

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
I've taken a real shine to a girl

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
I fancy a young lady

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
I fancy a young lady

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
I like the

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
Nevermind, her bustle

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
A delight

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
She has the best Lindy Hop in the Tri-County area

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
Um

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
So anyway, I've taken a real shine to a girl I know

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
And after thinking about whether I have a chance or not

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
I'm feeling inspired by your advice on the show

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
Have decided to give it a go

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
Oh, there's your first mistake

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
After some friendly banter, she asked if I was doing anything later

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
Yes, and we soon arranged

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
To meet later in the evening

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
Yeah

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
You're welcome

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
Tell your kids about us

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
I wish more people would write and let us know or name them after us

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
More accurately

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
Thing is, I'm not 100% certain this is a date

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
Don't get me wrong, by all accounts

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
This seems like one when you read it

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
Read it back, indeed

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
But this is one of those girls who has a naturally

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
flirtatious demeanor

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
Meaning it could just be a friendly meetup

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
Here comes the real problem

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
I'm going to try to keep this meeting on the down low

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
So I can ascertain the truth of the matter

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
And not have it announced to our social circle

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
That I'm trying to court this girl

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
Well, Max, I know your fucking first problem, buddy

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
Maybe

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
Does your social circle listen to our podcast?

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
Because this is a bad start

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
Probably not, let's be realistic

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
Yeah

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
If not, then you've got an even bigger problem

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
And that's that you haven't

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
Shared this with your loved ones

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
I think

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
And maybe this is just me

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
I don't know how the young people are today

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
I don't know the

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
Their various social

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
Codes, signals

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
They send to each other

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
It's all online now

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
Is it all?

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
See, I was afraid of that

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
I think that if you

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
Make an appointment to do something

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
It's a date

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
With a lady and a guy

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
Just by themselves, it's a date

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
Like, if you

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
If she invites along other friends

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
Or suggests that you invite

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
Along other people, it's not a date

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
But if she's saying, let's just do this, you and me

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
You gotta assume it's a date

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
It's on her if it's not a date

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
Do not spend the entire date trying to figure out if it's a date or not

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
Or you will fuck it up

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
You will fuck it up, bro

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
You will probably be better off

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
If you act like it's not a date

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
Because that will

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
That will keep the confidence high

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
I don't feel like pressure like

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
Should I hold her hand? Should I kiss her?

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
Should I hold her kiss?

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
Jayda Kiss

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
Jayda Kiss, D'Angelo

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
All the questions that seep into a young man's mind

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
Should I take her to see the lake house?

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
Should I take her to see the lake house again?

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
That's the only movie she's ever seen

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
What other movies are there?

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
I take a much more backwards

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
Approach to my social engagements

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
Where at the end of any social

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
Engagement I partake in

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
I try and kiss the other party

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
And if they take it

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
Then I will know in retrospect that it was a date

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
And if they fight me off

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
Then I know

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
The truth

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
It was really awkward when Griffin got his taxes done

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
Well, I don't know because my H&R Block

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
Representative

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
She was fantastic

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
The weirdest was when he was baptized

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
And he's had them all over the world

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
As far as your

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
Friends finding out

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
You know, don't worry about it

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
They'll all grow up and if they're

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
Dicks, don't worry about it

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
It'll be cool

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
Just don't adhere to any labels, man

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
You know what I'm saying?

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
It doesn't matter if it's a quote-unquote

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
Date or not, or if it's just a friendly

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
Hangout, if it turns into love

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
Yeah, it's by less pressure if you don't

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
If it's not a date, then you can

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
Just hang out, and you know what?

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
Dude, seriously, if you don't

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
Hang out with her, treat it like it's a friendship

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
And if you don't like spending time

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
With her in that context, then you

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
Probably don't want to do it again anyway

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
And honestly, if you like spending time with her

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
If you don't act like it's a date

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
You can probably preserve the friendship easier

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
If it doesn't work out

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
Actually, that's a great point, because we get asked a lot about

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
Friendzone, and I was friend

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
No one that actually likes you

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
Romantically puts you in the friendzone

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
So there's no concern of like

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
I became too good of friends with this person

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
And now they don't want to date me

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
They didn't want to date you before

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
And they just wanted to be friends with you

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
And hey, this goes for him

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
And Max, and everybody

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
Let us know how this stuff works out

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
If you follow our advice

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
Not that we recommend you do that

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
Or anything else we've ever told you to do

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
Anything else we've ever told you to do

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
Yahoo questions user

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
Simmons, aka

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
That Guy

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
Asks, in all caps

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
Help my little baby sister

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
She drank beer

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
Hi, one of my little baby sisters

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
Who is 11 months old just drank some beer

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
She didn't drink a lot, and she doesn't seem affected by it

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
But my mom is freaking out and yelling at all of us

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
But I think she is fine, and my mom doesn't think so

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
Can anyone help? And no bullshit

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
Serious answers only

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
Take her keys away

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
First and foremost

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
Don't let her drive

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
This is another

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
One of those times where we have to remind you

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
Of the right time

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
To call poison control

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
And the right time to ask Yahoo answers

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
What you should do about your situation

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
Because it's not now

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
Babies think they can party

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
Babies don't got shit

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
These babies come up here

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
They think that they can roll with the big dogs

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
Trying to stab

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
I don't think humans get livers

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
Until they're like 3

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
You gotta earn that shit

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
Where's that beer going?

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
I think we're missing some important

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
What beer?

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
Oh that's another

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
That's a big beer

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
What did you let her have first?

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
Did you let her have some highlife?

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
If it's like a heady dogfish stout

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
Then that baby's donezo

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
That baby's out

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
My baby sister just slammed a Rasputin

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
Oh no

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
What if she had a PBR?

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
You got a hipster baby on your hands now

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
Hope you can find really small

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
Horn rimmed glasses

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
Plaid shirts

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
Tiny fixy tricycle

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
These jeans don't come any smaller

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
I'm sorry

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
You'll have to go to the My Buddy aisle

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
To find smaller jeans

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
For tight tight hipster babies

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
Tight tight hipster jeans

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
At the Gymboree

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
But seriously

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
Go to a hospital I think

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
Have her drink a glass of water

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
And an ibuprofen

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
And a glass of water in the morning

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
And she'll be fine

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
Also film that shit and put it on YouTube

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
Did you guys hear about

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
Josh

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
His problem

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
He wrote to us gmail

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
Our answer

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
Just found out

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
My ex cheated on me with her current boyfriend

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
When we were still together

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
What's the best way to set a person aflame?

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
I think you gotta play in one of the hits

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
Of D'Angelo

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
And just watch their heart light up

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
Right? Does that mean literal?

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
Yeah I was gonna say literally

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
Fire

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
But

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
Fire and some sort of flammable oils

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
They gotta be asleep

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
That's so important

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
Or unconscious in some way

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
Yeah you can't just like start

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
You will never work

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
You will be shocked at how quickly a motivated man

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
Is gonna fire

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
Josh let me drop something on you

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
That Jerry Springer dropped on me when I was 12

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
A bottle of beer

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
A bottle of beer

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
That is one of

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
The wise Jerry's final thoughts was

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
If someone will cheat on

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
Someone to be with you

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
Then they will cheat on you to be with someone else

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
So drop that knowledge on her new boyfriend

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
Like listen dude

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
I don't know what makes you think

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
She wouldn't cheat on you she cheated on me

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
Hey bye

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
And then dip

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
That's possible

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
Maybe you just didn't love her hard enough

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
I know that's kind of

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
I know that's

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
That's a harsh reality but

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
Did you love her as hard as you possibly could?

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
You know what you just said she's your ex

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
Who cares man

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
Let it go move on

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
Griffin you made a great point too

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
No girl cheats on someone

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
Or nobody cheats on someone they're happy with

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
You know what I mean?

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
Unless they get drunk at their office party

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
Unless they get drunk at their office party

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
Or the someone is profoundly physically attracted

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
Also that

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
And that's another thing I'm just going to heads up real quick

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
Listeners

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
We appreciate questions and we appreciate

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
Input and we appreciate you listening

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
Questions about

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
How to get

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
People with boyfriends and girlfriends

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
To sleep with you

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
Not really our expertise

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
Or something we're going to address

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
Not cool

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
Not cool just be cool that's the number one

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
Advice of my big bam

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
And

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
Just don't hate

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
I'm just going to give you an in general answer to those questions

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
Question my friend has a

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
Girlfriend I want to sleep with what do I do?

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
Answer realize he's not

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
Really your friend

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
You guys maybe aren't as close as

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
You thought

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
Joseph has a conundrum

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
There's a girl he works with

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
Who he met while she was

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
Reading about the new Pokemon game

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
That got the conversation

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
Started now I'm at a loss

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
For what to do next should I just go

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
Forward ask her out I'm really

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
Bad at the asking out part what should

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
I do what should I ask her out

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
To dinner or something

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
Else maybe Digimon

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
Hold on Gertrude

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
Just go ahead

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
I think maybe you could arrange some sort

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
Of series of romantic Pokemon

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
Battles right

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
You know what I'm saying maybe kind of

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
Sexy Pokemon battles like that could be

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
The way that you ask her out like oh if my

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
My Charizard topples your Venusaur

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
How do you feel about a little

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
Squirtle and of course you will because

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
Her Venusaur will be weak to your Charizard's fire

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
Attacks

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
That's all I can

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
Do that's all I can summon up

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
I can't do anymore

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
I think that

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
Ask her about your Pokeballs

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
Oh Jesus

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
You could

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
You could just ask her if you

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
You two want to meet up the next day we could do an anonymous

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
Meeting I figure

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
You could try that

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
Ask her how her collection of cats is doing

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
I'm trying to make fun of this guy

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
But honestly

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
I feel like his email is pretty much just

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
Sort of

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
Got it out there

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
I mean I don't want to make fun of him

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
We just said that

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
It's a good reason to have a relationship with

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
Somebody if you both dig Pokemon

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
We can poke fun all we want

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
Dude met a girl

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
What's up beautiful

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
Keep the human race going

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
Joseph you had the courage

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
To email a podcast

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
To ask him how to ask out a girl

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
Who your only contact with her

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
Is Pokemon related

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
I don't think you'll have any problem mustering up

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
The courage to ask her out and do something

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
Your balls are huge dude

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
Your pokeballs

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
Your penis are ginormous

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
You can see your pokeballs from space

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
It doesn't matter what you do

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
It doesn't matter what you ask her out

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
To do

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
As long as you have fun

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
As long as it is interesting

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
Be interested in her

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
The date is not important

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
The experience is important

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
Be interested in her Pokemon

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
That's what she wants to talk about the whole time

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
But you guys are making fun

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
Dude if you've got that N

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
If that's your N

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
It's unconventional

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
But you gotta fight tooth and nail

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
For love

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
And you have the best

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
Nerd point argument ever

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
Well I disagree

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
Because I met a girl

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
And you will win every nerd argument like that

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
Joseph if I could just

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
Give you one other piece of advice before we move on

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
Hold on to this one real tight

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
Just really

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
Trust me on this one

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
Don't let her go

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
Just

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
We don't know how many more times

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
This opportunity is going to present itself

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
By which we mean none

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
So just really hold on to this one okay

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
For me

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
Just hold on tight

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
Trust me

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
Make it work

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
Make it work

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
Gordo

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
That's a great name

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
Gordo asks on gmail

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
I am super whipped

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
By my girlfriend and generally despise my life

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
My brother and friends say

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
I'm more whipped than even the most whipped guy

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
On TV

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
No that's a good metric

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
Haven't you seen the new reality show

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
The Most Whipped Guy

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
I would break up with her but I feel

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
Bad about it and I'm locked into a few

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
Trips that include her

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
What do I do

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
Stop planning trips

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
Why do you have more than one trip planned

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
Step one

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
Start dropping subtle hints

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
Asking about refundability of certain trip deposits

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
Babe you know that trip we had planned

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
In 2015 I returned it

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
Stop planning trips

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
We got Bonnaroo in June

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
And then the cruise in September

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
But so help me God

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
October rolls around

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
Guys

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
Listen man trust me on this one

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
Trust me

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
If you get to a point where you think

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
I want to break up with somebody

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
Get in a car

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
Find them and do it right then

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
Because there's not a second of your life

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
You're not going to spend worrying about it until then

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
And as soon as you do it you will be

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
You will feel so much better

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
And you are not doing them any favors by waiting

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
Yep don't go on the trips

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
Because then like okay

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
Let's say you got a romantic cabin

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
Trip planned for this weekend right

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
You're going to go on that cabin trip next weekend

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
You say I think we should break up

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
Oh man that cabin trip

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
That you just went on is completely

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
Invalidated like it never happened

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
Even worse

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
You're going to say nice things on that cabin trip

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
You're not going to sit on the opposite side

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
You're going to say like baby I love you

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
And then the next week break up with her

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
That's going to make it messy dude

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
And the thing is a lot of people shy away from breakups

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
Because like oh it's going to be messy

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
Every breakup is messy it gets better

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
The sooner you do it

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
It starts healing immediately afterwards

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
So the longer you put it off

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
The worse it's going to be

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
I know it sucks man I know it sucks

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
But you got to do it

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
Don't waste any more time you're wasting your life

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
And also your money

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
Stop planning trips

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
Stop planning trips Aaron from

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
Gmail says how do I comment on my wife's

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
Terrible new haircut without lying

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
Here let me feed this one for you Aaron

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
You ready

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
Get close

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
Lie

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
Glad I could help

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
Rob on

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
Gmail says I'm having a

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
Baby girl in June my first

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
We have a first name

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
Picked out but haven't chosen a middle

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
What do you think of the middle name Danger

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
For a girl my wife says it's white trash

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
But I don't know any white trash people with the middle name

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
Danger Your wife doesn't know shit

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
Yeah sorry Rob

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
But that doesn't

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
Those two things shouldn't associate

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
With each other at all

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
I generally have a baby naming

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
Rule and that is that naming your

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
Baby is not an opportunity for self

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
Expression

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
Because your kid has to live with it for the rest of their life

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
That being said

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
Danger as a middle name is

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
Badass

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
I say do it

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
You are raising the sort of person

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
Where

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
That's going to shape

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
Their life right

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
They're going to have to introduce themselves to

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
People that's going to come up

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
They're going to associate with people who

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
Think it's cool that their middle name is Danger

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
And that's a cool crowd

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
That's the kind of people you want

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
It'll be great and like her wedding

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
Her wedding day where there will be a lot of

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
People in attendance who don't know her middle name

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
And the preacher will be like do you

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
Eliza Danger McCutcheons

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
Take so and so

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
And everyone in the audience will be like Danger

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
Sweet

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
Yeah

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
I like it I'm a big fan

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
If she ever becomes like an international super

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
Spy it's right there

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
Danger is my middle name

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
She can actually say I love it

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
Right but that joke she's going to hate

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
That joke no unless she becomes

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
An adventurer

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
But even then like

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
The danger is my middle name thing like people are

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
Going to say that to her at parties and she will

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
Get sick of it after like the second time

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
That might get a little old actually

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
I'm saying that the word itself

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
The concept of danger

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
As a moniker is so strong

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
Yeah what about

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
Adventure I like that one

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
Excitement Punctuality

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
Monkey Shines

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
Monkey Shines is my middle name

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
What's the best way to

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
This is from Maverick

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
89 What's the best way

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
To remember stuff you've forgotten

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
This question is so paradoxical

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
I've been thinking about it all day

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
And I can't

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
I forgot to think about it

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
No come on

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
First creed

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
Now this

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
A2 Travy

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
Listen it's been an awful week

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
I think you just need to sit down

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
You gotta sit down in the dark

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
You just gotta turn on the AC

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
Low as it goes

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
High as it goes?

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
Make the temperature

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
As close to zero as you can get it

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
Okay

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
Ice down?

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
Cover your body in ice and oils

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
Icy oil

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
Think as hard as you possibly can

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
About some old shit

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
That happened to you

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
Back there back in the day

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
Cause you got shit back there that happened

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
To you with you

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
You have memories in there

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
Cobwebs

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
They are cobwebs surrounded

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
And you gotta get back there with the oils and just get them out

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
Just dust them out

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
So what you gotta do is you gotta pop some ginkgo

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
Dust them off

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
Drink a shasta

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
Get in the dark and just sit and get them out

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
Watch some old movies

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
Watch a movie that was created

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
In the year that you were born

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
And just think

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
Like the lake house? Were you born in 1997?

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
Like the lake house?

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
Think deep

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
That movie came out in like 2005 dog

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
Sorry dog we're back

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
I forgot

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
No but for real ginkgo it up

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
The best way to do it

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
If you're talking about something

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
And reset like I was gonna say something

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
And I can't remember it

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
Retrace what you were talking about

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
Or just stop thinking about it

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
The more you try to think about it

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
The more you're going to think about thinking about it

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
And not actually remember it

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
As humans we have a short term memory and a long term memory

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
And getting things to transition from

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
Short term to long term memory is a process

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
Didn't you hear

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
The part with the ginkgo

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
And the ice didn't you think that that pretty well covered it?

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
I answered this question pretty

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
Decisive. I feel like he's probably

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
Already remembered it. He's probably stopped listening already

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
Uh huh

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
Maybe he was trying to remember to unsubscribe

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
I don't think you can blame him

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
I know I can't

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
Dude it's coke

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000

Don't even worry about it

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
Because that's not gonna work out

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
You had your shot and you blew it

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
You blew it
