00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.640 --> 00:51.440
Ladies and gentlemen, after taking a week off to finish our groundbreaking work on the Herman

00:51.440 --> 00:57.440
Cain campaign, we return to you, my brother, my brother and me, an advice show for the modern era

00:57.440 --> 01:05.200
with heavy hearts today. We drove that bitch until the wheels fell off, right? Somebody put a penny

01:05.200 --> 01:10.080
on the track, and that penny was common sense, and it knocked us clean up. That penny is called

01:10.080 --> 01:16.400
sexual harassment allegations, and allegations of a long-term affair, and that penny, it took the

01:16.400 --> 01:21.280
cane tray and cleaned off the tracks. Is that really? Where did we go wrong, Travis? Griffin,

01:21.280 --> 01:28.480
where did we go wrong? I just can't believe that something that minute ended our nation's most

01:28.480 --> 01:36.400
beautiful dream. Something as small as a 13-year-long illicit affair. Yeah, that's only

01:36.400 --> 01:44.560
an affair that is as old as a seventh grader. You know, if we looked at time in its completeness,

01:44.560 --> 01:52.720
13 years? Not that much. Consider the fullness of time, Huffington Post. Give it a thought. Give it

01:52.720 --> 02:01.280
a once-over. Give it a once-over, you jerks. You know, I told my children that they would live to

02:01.280 --> 02:10.000
see a day when a black, unqualified man could be president of this country, and you are ruining-

02:10.000 --> 02:17.440
you are making me a liar to my non-existent children. I told my 13-year-old love child

02:17.440 --> 02:24.640
that he would get to see his daddy in the White House. And mommy won to walk across that stage

02:24.640 --> 02:30.960
as mommy, too, clapped inconspicuously from the crowd. I promised him that, sir.

02:32.320 --> 02:34.080
Guys. That's a lot of America. You ruined it.

02:34.080 --> 02:39.360
Well, hey. This, of course, is an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother

02:39.360 --> 02:44.080
and campaign manager, Justin McElroy. I am your middlest brother and intern,

02:44.080 --> 02:50.320
Travis McElroy. And I am Griffin McElroy, the charming and witty press secretary.

02:52.240 --> 02:56.000
Hey, I saw you and Danny Kankanen in the back of the room.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.920
Oh, we were smoochin'.

02:57.920 --> 02:59.600
Smoochin'? Do not approve.

02:59.600 --> 03:01.440
I'd smooch his beard clean off.

03:01.440 --> 03:05.200
Hey, where's your beard, Timothy Busfield? Go ahead and smooch it off again.

03:05.200 --> 03:10.400
Smooch it off. Give me a sweet goldfish, you sweet, sweet bearded man.

03:10.400 --> 03:14.480
So, brothers, I really like this girl, and she likes me. However,

03:14.480 --> 03:20.480
she is two to three inches taller than me. Is this a deal breaker? That's from Compact

03:21.120 --> 03:22.640
in Kentucky.

03:22.640 --> 03:23.920
Why are you so small?

03:23.920 --> 03:24.720
Why are you so small?

03:24.720 --> 03:25.600
Why are you so tiny?

03:26.240 --> 03:27.360
Why are you so little?

03:27.360 --> 03:28.000
Hey, little guy.

03:28.000 --> 03:31.440
You know, two to three inches? Are you shitting me?

03:31.440 --> 03:31.920
Yeah.

03:31.920 --> 03:36.000
We just wasted three months of our life trying to get Herman Cain elected president,

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
and you're worried about two to three inches?

03:38.000 --> 03:42.640
Now, if it was two to three feet, yeah, it's a deal breaker. She's like nine feet tall.

03:42.640 --> 03:44.320
Right. She's a big, friendly giant.

03:44.320 --> 03:48.880
I'm dating Mandy the Giant, and that was the closest female version of Andrea.

03:48.880 --> 03:50.560
As I said, you mean Mondre?

03:50.560 --> 03:51.840
Andrea. Damn it.

03:51.840 --> 03:52.560
Damn it.

03:52.560 --> 03:53.120
Yeah.

03:53.120 --> 03:57.840
Here's the thing. What I like about this kind of worry is if this was a girl,

03:57.840 --> 04:01.760
and she was saying, I like this guy, but he's two to three inches taller than me,

04:01.760 --> 04:03.840
everyone would be like, that's stupid. What are you talking about?

04:03.840 --> 04:05.600
I think it's a little bit sexist.

04:05.600 --> 04:09.840
Is it sexist or is it scientifically proven that men are a little bit taller than women, Travis?

04:10.720 --> 04:14.400
Just a little bit. Not a lot. Just a little bit. And not all women.

04:14.400 --> 04:15.680
I know women who are taller than me.

04:16.560 --> 04:22.080
Griffin, I did read your paper titled Women Be Short, and I thought that was really interesting.

04:22.080 --> 04:31.280
Well, it's not. They got those tiny little robin bones like a robin bird has.

04:31.280 --> 04:35.360
Travis, I wanted to ask you something about Herman Cain real quick before I return to the question.

04:36.160 --> 04:38.960
You're not so great with keeping up on politics, right?

04:40.080 --> 04:45.280
You are sometimes out of the loop as far as that stuff goes.

04:45.280 --> 04:53.120
Travis, are you aware that in his final speech suspending his campaign,

04:53.120 --> 04:55.280
and I promise we will return to this question in just a moment,

04:56.560 --> 05:01.920
are you aware that in his final campaign speech he quoted the Pokemon movie?

05:02.960 --> 05:06.800
And not just quoted the Pokemon movie, but specifically cited,

05:07.680 --> 05:11.360
I believe these words came from the Pokemon movie.

05:11.360 --> 05:16.480
Life can be a challenge. Life could seem impossible. It's never easy when there's so much on the line.

05:17.520 --> 05:18.720
Are you kidding me?

05:18.720 --> 05:19.760
No, I'm not.

05:19.760 --> 05:23.760
No, okay. I want you guys to know I was in no way invested in his campaign,

05:23.760 --> 05:26.720
but only now when he's gone do I realize what I missed.

05:27.280 --> 05:30.240
Yeah, you don't. Don't it always seem to go?

05:33.760 --> 05:36.640
Hey, paradise, and quoted Pokemon.

05:37.200 --> 05:40.800
Somebody tweeted about him like he wasn't having affairs.

05:40.800 --> 05:42.320
He was just trying to catch them all.

05:42.320 --> 05:44.400
Yeah, that makes sense now.

05:45.120 --> 05:46.400
Guys, we have to go back.

05:47.200 --> 05:48.000
So anyway,

05:48.000 --> 05:49.520
We have to go back.

05:50.240 --> 05:52.560
We have to go back to the train.

05:55.760 --> 05:59.200
I'm gonna have to wait till 2016 to get that beautiful motherfucker back on the stage and

05:59.200 --> 05:59.760
just know it.

06:00.960 --> 06:01.440
Damn it.

06:01.440 --> 06:04.720
Is there any other things that he can run for in the meantime?

06:05.440 --> 06:07.760
Yeah, we could use a new mayor.

06:07.760 --> 06:13.920
Of all cities, can he just be the across the board mayor?

06:13.920 --> 06:14.720
The super mayor.

06:15.920 --> 06:16.640
I have a problem.

06:16.640 --> 06:19.440
My super mayor is two to three inches taller than me.

06:19.440 --> 06:20.560
And made of metal.

06:20.560 --> 06:23.920
And made of metal and has missile fingers.

06:23.920 --> 06:26.080
Okay, you guys might tell me if I'm out of line here.

06:27.280 --> 06:33.680
I feel like this two to three inch taller problem is only a problem depending on how old they are.

06:33.680 --> 06:36.160
Is it?

06:36.160 --> 06:39.520
If they're in high school versus like 26, 27.

06:41.280 --> 06:43.760
High schoolers don't know how to use the internet to email though.

06:45.040 --> 06:45.840
That is true.

06:45.840 --> 06:47.200
They don't learn that till college.

06:47.200 --> 06:48.080
Yeah, they're not allowed.

06:48.080 --> 06:49.520
Hey, why don't you know?

06:49.520 --> 06:52.640
If you're so hung up on this, why don't you know exactly how much the difference is?

06:53.600 --> 06:56.160
2.4 inches taller than me.

06:56.160 --> 06:58.400
If you're on a metric system, you could do that.

06:58.400 --> 06:58.640
Yeah.

06:58.640 --> 06:59.120
Right.

06:59.120 --> 07:00.720
God damn our stupid inch system.

07:00.720 --> 07:01.360
I know.

07:01.360 --> 07:04.480
But the thing is I feel like maybe if she's taller than him,

07:04.480 --> 07:09.840
he's worried that he'll catch some flack from other students and other bullies and whatnot.

07:12.160 --> 07:15.840
She's so big that she'll absorb all the flack for him.

07:15.840 --> 07:16.400
Oh, I see.

07:16.400 --> 07:17.040
Right.

07:17.040 --> 07:18.480
She can take that flack.

07:18.480 --> 07:20.480
Leave tiny boyfriend alone.

07:24.880 --> 07:26.720
Maybe they're both super tall.

07:26.720 --> 07:28.640
And one of them is less super tall than the other.

07:28.640 --> 07:32.240
She's seven foot five and I'm only seven foot two.

07:32.240 --> 07:32.640
Right.

07:32.640 --> 07:35.680
I'm afraid her parents are going to try to dunk on me.

07:38.880 --> 07:39.920
That was not a deal breaker.

07:39.920 --> 07:41.600
To answer the question, not a deal breaker.

07:41.600 --> 07:45.200
If you're so concerned about it, then why don't you buy some man pumps?

07:46.800 --> 07:49.120
Yeah, man pumps are available.

07:49.120 --> 07:55.360
Slap some man pumps on that bitch and then height problem solved.

07:55.360 --> 07:55.840
No joke.

07:55.840 --> 07:59.040
Cowboy boots will give you like another inch and a half to two inches.

07:59.040 --> 08:00.720
Look, you're halfway there.

08:00.720 --> 08:07.680
Now put a nice spiky stiletto on your cowboy boot and you'll be five inches taller.

08:07.680 --> 08:08.960
And a 10 gallon hat.

08:08.960 --> 08:10.560
Get yourself a 10 gallon hat.

08:10.560 --> 08:11.680
That's the look right there.

08:11.680 --> 08:15.520
You got to get yourself a cowboy ugly boot and a coyote ugly.

08:15.520 --> 08:15.840
Fuck.

08:20.080 --> 08:22.240
You got to find yourself an ugly cowboy.

08:22.240 --> 08:26.160
You got to find an ugly cowboy and ride him to save a horse.

08:26.160 --> 08:26.720
Big and rich.

08:27.440 --> 08:28.000
Big and rich.

08:28.560 --> 08:32.560
Hey, in August, I moved into a house with three friends from college.

08:32.560 --> 08:36.560
While I was out one day, my roommates decorated the house without asking me.

08:37.200 --> 08:40.320
I hate the art they hung up on the walls.

08:40.320 --> 08:41.280
Here's the rub.

08:41.280 --> 08:44.320
The art was all done by my roommate's girlfriend of five years.

08:44.320 --> 08:50.160
There's no way I can broach the subject without coming off like a complete asshole.

08:50.880 --> 08:51.840
What do I do?

08:51.840 --> 08:53.520
That's from Irkt in Indiana.

08:54.400 --> 08:55.920
You hire someone to rob your house.

08:57.200 --> 08:59.040
Oh my God, Travis.

08:59.040 --> 08:59.920
That's brilliant.

09:00.480 --> 09:00.880
Thank you.

09:01.840 --> 09:08.480
It's a art thief with great taste, apparently, because he stole all of Janie's paintings of

09:08.480 --> 09:11.200
her dog and her dog's friends' dogs.

09:11.200 --> 09:14.480
The other option is, I think, equally as good.

09:14.480 --> 09:19.360
And that is you hire someone to dress as an art collector and sweep into the room in their

09:19.360 --> 09:22.480
half cape and beret and say, I'll take them.

09:22.480 --> 09:22.720
Yeah.

09:25.840 --> 09:26.800
That's going to require some-

09:26.800 --> 09:31.920
As the cigarette dangles from the long cigarette holder with their tiny mustache.

09:31.920 --> 09:32.800
Speaking of cigarettes-

09:32.800 --> 09:33.680
An eye patch.

09:33.680 --> 09:36.160
Speaking of cigarettes, maybe burn the apartment down.

09:36.160 --> 09:36.640
Hey.

09:36.640 --> 09:37.760
That's another solution.

09:39.680 --> 09:42.800
Why don't you speak up and talk to your rude ass roommate who decorated?

09:42.800 --> 09:44.640
Yeah, I just put some paintings in your room.

09:44.640 --> 09:45.520
Is that cool?

09:45.520 --> 09:46.480
It's absolutely not.

09:46.480 --> 09:48.480
It is absolutely not cool.

09:49.280 --> 09:51.600
These paintings are not cool with me.

09:51.600 --> 09:56.320
I don't feel like an asshole because he's the fucking guy who made all the Martha Stewart

09:56.320 --> 10:00.640
decisions without asking you, and that's the best part of a house, is that you get to decorate

10:00.640 --> 10:01.840
and make it your own.

10:02.320 --> 10:03.280
You didn't make it your own, though.

10:03.280 --> 10:05.040
You made it Jeff's.

10:05.840 --> 10:09.920
Jeff was the asshole first, and now you are completely within your right to be like, hey,

10:09.920 --> 10:12.400
this decoration choice, we tried it out for a while.

10:12.400 --> 10:13.760
I don't think it's working.

10:13.760 --> 10:17.840
My friends who come over, they don't like it, and we want to switch it out for something

10:17.840 --> 10:19.200
else and see how that works.

10:19.200 --> 10:22.240
Is this art violently sexual?

10:22.240 --> 10:24.480
Like really, really-

10:24.480 --> 10:25.680
This is all boobs.

10:25.680 --> 10:26.640
Aggressively sexual.

10:26.640 --> 10:27.840
Boobs everywhere.

10:27.840 --> 10:28.320
Yeah.

10:28.320 --> 10:28.820
Yeah.

10:29.360 --> 10:33.120
Why don't you get your own art that is in fact violently sexual and hang it up?

10:33.120 --> 10:34.720
Say, I don't know, I'm just trying this out too.

10:34.720 --> 10:38.240
This is my painting and it's five dogs playing poker.

10:38.240 --> 10:39.840
Also, they have giant boners.

10:39.840 --> 10:40.340
Yeah.

10:40.340 --> 10:46.100
You need to have this conversation with your roommate.

10:46.100 --> 10:47.060
That's option one.

10:47.060 --> 10:48.020
You talk to him about it.

10:48.020 --> 10:50.900
Option two, guy comes in and buys them.

10:50.900 --> 10:52.180
Option three, burn it down.

10:52.180 --> 10:56.500
Option four, thief, art thief.

10:56.500 --> 10:57.000
Yeah.

10:58.020 --> 11:01.140
I think the other one is you just suffer.

11:01.140 --> 11:01.940
Just eat it.

11:01.940 --> 11:05.860
You know, so often we rush to fix the little things that

11:05.860 --> 11:10.580
plague us, but it's like you don't appreciate breathing until you try to hold your breath.

11:10.580 --> 11:11.080
Yeah.

11:11.080 --> 11:14.580
Why don't you just try living with something you hate for a while and then it'd be such

11:14.580 --> 11:17.460
a refreshing change when you finally get out of it.

11:17.460 --> 11:24.900
But is it possible that our listener here, say his name is Stephen, that these paintings

11:24.900 --> 11:30.260
just say like, Stephen's a dick and they're just like, patients of Stephen with a knife

11:30.260 --> 11:30.900
in his head.

11:30.900 --> 11:32.100
This is absolutely-

11:32.100 --> 11:35.860
Patients of Stephen with a knife in his head.

11:35.860 --> 11:38.820
This is an apple, but the apple is saying, fuck you, Stephen.

11:38.820 --> 11:39.320
Yeah.

11:39.780 --> 11:41.060
I do not think that is...

11:42.500 --> 11:45.220
Oh, and then the roommate and his girlfriend are just standing there going, what do you

11:45.220 --> 11:46.500
think, Stephen?

11:46.500 --> 11:53.220
I believe this is from her 2011 Stephen Sucks Dick collection.

11:54.900 --> 11:59.140
This magnum opus is titled, Fuck Off, Stephen, You're a Jerk.

11:59.140 --> 12:02.580
And that's it.

12:02.580 --> 12:03.700
That's the end of the painting.

12:03.700 --> 12:05.940
It ends on ellipses because it's art.

12:11.300 --> 12:12.580
Is this that big of a deal?

12:12.580 --> 12:14.660
I feel like I don't even notice art most of the time.

12:15.540 --> 12:17.860
I don't think it's that big of a deal, but I can see where this would be the kind of

12:17.860 --> 12:22.580
thing that just kind of eats at you and just like you come home from a hard day at work

12:22.580 --> 12:25.460
and suddenly you look up and there's that stupid ass painting.

12:25.460 --> 12:27.060
It's like, here's one more thing I don't need.

12:27.060 --> 12:30.500
I can see where it would be a tiny thing that just bugs at you.

12:31.860 --> 12:36.900
But if it's like two werewolves sucking each other off, then you are going to notice it

12:36.900 --> 12:38.180
every time you walk into the house.

12:39.700 --> 12:41.780
You're going to be embarrassed to bring people.

12:41.780 --> 12:42.900
I'm saying this is...

12:42.900 --> 12:47.300
We're definitely dealing with an aggressively sexual lycanthropic art situation.

12:49.300 --> 12:49.780
Maybe it's...

12:51.380 --> 12:52.340
It's Taylor Lautner.

12:52.340 --> 12:58.100
He's man from the waist up, werewolf from the waist down, from the waist out, he is

12:58.100 --> 13:00.900
all boner, extending on the Y axis.

13:03.780 --> 13:04.340
Oh, God.

13:04.900 --> 13:08.420
Maybe you just one day when they're out, you redecorate and be like, oh, I thought this

13:08.420 --> 13:09.700
was the thing we were doing, man.

13:09.700 --> 13:11.700
Just taking turns redecorating every couple months.

13:12.420 --> 13:15.060
I thought it was my month to have some shitty paintings.

13:15.060 --> 13:15.940
Sorry, Jenny.

13:15.940 --> 13:16.660
I didn't mean that.

13:17.780 --> 13:18.580
No offense.

13:18.580 --> 13:19.940
I didn't mean shitty, Jenny.

13:19.940 --> 13:20.580
Griffin, do you have a...

13:20.580 --> 13:21.860
Maybe they are shitty paintings.

13:21.860 --> 13:24.340
Maybe that's her medium, is human fecal matter.

13:24.340 --> 13:26.500
There's so many ways for this art to be bad art.

13:27.940 --> 13:29.060
Get out of here, bad art.

13:30.180 --> 13:30.980
I have a Yahoo.

13:31.620 --> 13:34.740
This Yahoo was sent in by Atiana Kuriana.

13:34.740 --> 13:35.540
Thank you, Atiana.

13:36.660 --> 13:42.580
It's by Yahoo Answers user Allison, who asks, any good Facebook statuses?

13:44.980 --> 13:48.180
I know this sounds tacky, but I haven't updated my status in a while.

13:48.180 --> 13:51.620
And do any of you have any good statuses that will get a lot of likes?

13:51.620 --> 13:53.300
They have to be appropriate for a teenage girl

13:53.300 --> 13:55.220
because my mom gets on Facebook like every day.

13:55.220 --> 13:58.260
Any funny, meaningful, meaningless, or cool statuses?

14:01.140 --> 14:02.500
All answers greatly appreciated.

14:02.500 --> 14:02.900
Thank you.

14:06.100 --> 14:10.020
I don't want to live in this world anymore.

14:10.020 --> 14:11.860
That's what the status should be?

14:11.860 --> 14:15.380
No, that's what the title of my autobiography is.

14:15.380 --> 14:15.880
Okay.

14:16.980 --> 14:19.700
Do you know that they just bumped up the Facebook status limit?

14:19.700 --> 14:24.260
Uh, the amount of characters you can use to 63,000.

14:25.140 --> 14:25.940
That's important.

14:25.940 --> 14:27.620
Sometimes people make fucking manifest.

14:27.620 --> 14:30.180
Sometimes people write novellas and post them on the Facebook.

14:30.180 --> 14:31.700
63,000.

14:31.700 --> 14:31.940
Yeah.

14:31.940 --> 14:35.860
And then they tag you in it and you're not in it till the end.

14:35.860 --> 14:36.360
Yeah.

14:36.580 --> 14:38.180
And you read that whole dumb thing.

14:38.180 --> 14:41.140
I just read about your whole fucking Christmas trip to Target.

14:41.140 --> 14:42.980
Thanks for wasting my entire life.

14:44.020 --> 14:44.660
Yeah.

14:44.660 --> 14:46.740
Why did you even tell everybody about that?

14:46.740 --> 14:47.060
How?

14:47.060 --> 14:48.020
Who has this much time?

14:48.020 --> 14:50.260
You know, when I last updated my status update?

14:50.260 --> 14:52.340
When I want people to know that I did something cool.

14:52.340 --> 14:56.260
That's the only time that you should ever update your status or Twitter or anything.

14:56.260 --> 14:59.140
If you're doing something cooler than somebody else might be doing that exact second,

14:59.140 --> 14:59.860
that's when you tweet.

14:59.860 --> 15:02.260
Or you're making something good for dinner.

15:02.260 --> 15:05.540
For half of my status updates, just say, check out this thing I did.

15:06.100 --> 15:06.900
That's basically it.

15:07.460 --> 15:08.100
I made this.

15:09.140 --> 15:09.940
I made this thing.

15:10.580 --> 15:14.020
Okay, and as much as I hate people that are just like, I went to the store today.

15:14.020 --> 15:20.500
What I really hate is those ones that are like, you know, a true friend will do this,

15:20.500 --> 15:22.580
but a dear friend, and I'm just like, fuck you.

15:23.300 --> 15:25.220
You know, that's people that don't actually have friends.

15:25.220 --> 15:27.540
Can you give me an example of what you mean, Travis?

15:27.540 --> 15:29.060
Oh, you're gonna have to give me a second.

15:29.060 --> 15:30.260
I love an example too.

15:30.260 --> 15:31.060
I would love this.

15:31.060 --> 15:32.340
You're gonna have to give me a second.

15:32.340 --> 15:33.220
No, no, no.

15:33.220 --> 15:35.540
I would love it just like straight off the dome freestyle.

15:40.500 --> 15:41.460
I don't know.

15:41.460 --> 15:42.580
Oh, God, give me a fuck.

15:42.580 --> 15:44.980
So like a true friend will drive you to the airport.

15:44.980 --> 15:47.460
A dear friend will fly the plane.

15:51.140 --> 15:53.700
A good guy will get you flowers.

15:53.700 --> 15:56.020
The right guy will eat them for you.

15:56.020 --> 15:57.060
I don't know.

15:57.060 --> 15:58.580
Eat these flowers.

15:58.580 --> 15:59.460
Prove you love me.

15:59.460 --> 16:00.660
Eat these rhododendrons.

16:01.300 --> 16:03.220
Prove your love and eat the rhododendrons.

16:03.220 --> 16:04.180
Eat them, David.

16:04.740 --> 16:05.540
Bite the rose.

16:05.540 --> 16:06.180
Bite the rose, David.

16:06.180 --> 16:07.300
Bite the rose, David.

16:10.500 --> 16:10.980
Guys.

16:10.980 --> 16:11.780
Gingerly.

16:11.780 --> 16:19.220
She needs a real knock them out of the park Facebook status

16:19.220 --> 16:22.180
update that's gonna win her all kinds of awards.

16:22.180 --> 16:25.700
So basically what's gonna get her like the Nobel Peace Prize

16:25.700 --> 16:27.460
for Facebook status messages.

16:27.460 --> 16:27.860
Yeah.

16:27.860 --> 16:29.060
Here, I'll give you an example.

16:29.060 --> 16:32.340
Dwight suggested another day, another food stamp.

16:33.060 --> 16:34.500
I don't understand, Dwight.

16:34.500 --> 16:36.020
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

16:36.020 --> 16:37.060
Can you explain?

16:37.060 --> 16:40.260
Uh, no, I can't.

16:40.260 --> 16:40.900
Cause he didn't.

16:42.820 --> 16:45.620
Wouldn't it be nice if iPods could detect your mood and make

16:45.620 --> 16:46.660
a playlist for it?

16:47.220 --> 16:48.260
Oh man.

16:48.260 --> 16:52.340
That's so now that's so now and so hip kids care about.

16:52.340 --> 16:54.180
No, that would be terrifying.

16:54.180 --> 16:55.700
All about playlists and moods.

16:57.140 --> 16:59.540
When I fall down a flight of stairs, I'm not worried about

16:59.540 --> 17:00.580
if I'm hurt.

17:00.580 --> 17:02.020
I'm worried if anybody saw.

17:03.780 --> 17:04.020
Wow.

17:04.020 --> 17:06.100
Post-it that shit yourself.

17:06.100 --> 17:11.460
Yeah, these fucking snuff film videographer guy.

17:11.460 --> 17:13.860
How often are you falling downstairs that you're thinking

17:13.860 --> 17:14.820
about this this much?

17:15.780 --> 17:18.900
When I fall down stairs, I think I wish I could start falling

17:18.900 --> 17:20.260
down these damn stairs.

17:20.260 --> 17:21.940
I wish my legs worked better.

17:22.740 --> 17:24.980
I think I really got to put that light bulb back in.

17:26.820 --> 17:28.420
Damn these Crisco stairs.

17:29.620 --> 17:30.260
Wait a minute.

17:30.260 --> 17:30.500
What?

17:31.300 --> 17:34.020
You know, it's made out of lard.

17:34.020 --> 17:37.220
They're made out of their stairs made from lard now.

17:37.220 --> 17:37.620
Well, not.

17:37.620 --> 17:39.780
I mean, not primarily, but that's just like the finishing

17:39.780 --> 17:40.420
coat.

17:40.420 --> 17:40.980
Oh, my God.

17:40.980 --> 17:42.100
They put a coat you wrote.

17:42.100 --> 17:43.220
You mean they pledge them.

17:43.220 --> 17:45.620
They use the pledge and then they Crisco them.

17:45.620 --> 17:46.660
Then they lard them.

17:46.660 --> 17:48.340
Do you live in the home alone house?

17:48.340 --> 17:48.820
Is that what?

17:50.660 --> 17:51.700
Damn you, Kevin.

17:51.700 --> 17:54.260
They tie some fucking paint on the thing.

17:54.260 --> 17:57.940
Poor turpentine slipped on these micro machines.

17:57.940 --> 18:00.660
I feel like a pretty good sass update would be the wet band

18:00.660 --> 18:01.300
is right again.

18:01.300 --> 18:05.140
I want to make that my status update right now.

18:05.140 --> 18:07.780
I want my status update to be, you know, that old pigeon lady

18:07.780 --> 18:08.420
ain't so bad.

18:09.780 --> 18:11.620
What if our dreams are just blurred memories

18:11.620 --> 18:12.660
of our previous lives?

18:14.340 --> 18:14.660
What?

18:14.660 --> 18:16.820
These are all coming to us from Yahoo Answers user

18:16.820 --> 18:20.900
Los Pumas, who really turned out about 60 of these.

18:21.940 --> 18:22.260
Okay.

18:22.900 --> 18:27.220
I would like to think that this is basically like the new guy

18:27.220 --> 18:29.860
who writes the music for jingles kind of thing where he just

18:29.860 --> 18:31.460
sits and goes, okay, let me think.

18:32.660 --> 18:33.940
When I fall down the stairs.

18:33.940 --> 18:35.060
Yeah, good start.

18:35.060 --> 18:36.020
Fall down the stairs.

18:36.020 --> 18:37.220
I hope no one's looking.

18:37.780 --> 18:41.780
Yes, I love it when Ron Weasley say bloody hell smiley face.

18:42.660 --> 18:43.940
Is that from the same guy?

18:43.940 --> 18:44.180
Yeah.

18:44.820 --> 18:46.900
Is he just copying all of his status messages?

18:48.420 --> 18:48.980
I think so.

18:50.580 --> 18:53.140
Dear parents, just because it's your house doesn't mean it's

18:53.140 --> 18:54.340
not my privacy.

18:54.340 --> 19:03.940
Sincerely, teens, is this guy 45 teens?

19:03.940 --> 19:04.500
Guess what?

19:05.460 --> 19:08.100
It does mean that it means it.

19:08.980 --> 19:10.420
It means it all over.

19:10.420 --> 19:10.900
Teens.

19:10.900 --> 19:12.660
That's our new sign off for my brother.

19:12.660 --> 19:13.620
My brother and me.

19:13.620 --> 19:15.220
Kiss your dad's green lips is gone.

19:15.220 --> 19:16.180
Teens is in.

19:19.380 --> 19:20.020
Oh my God.

19:20.020 --> 19:22.900
There's websites that generate Facebook statuses for you.

19:22.900 --> 19:26.020
Oh, no, that's teens.

19:26.020 --> 19:26.980
Now I have a virus.

19:29.780 --> 19:30.660
Teens.

19:32.340 --> 19:33.300
Now maybe.

19:35.220 --> 19:36.500
Hey mom, get off my back.

19:37.220 --> 19:38.260
Teens.

19:38.260 --> 19:40.900
And you gotta put teens at the end is important.

19:40.900 --> 19:43.220
I think you got to sign off all your Facebook messages.

19:43.220 --> 19:44.180
The teens.

19:44.180 --> 19:46.420
Well, why don't you just put up some lyrics from your favorite?

19:46.420 --> 19:48.020
My chemical romance jacket.

19:49.060 --> 19:50.340
My jacket chemicals.

19:50.340 --> 19:52.420
My jacket of romance.

19:53.620 --> 19:55.060
My jacket of many colors.

19:57.060 --> 20:00.580
I don't know.

20:00.580 --> 20:03.540
This used to be a consideration of mine when I was on LiveJournal.

20:05.540 --> 20:06.820
This is so long gone.

20:08.020 --> 20:10.180
Trying to think of things to say that people would enjoy.

20:11.140 --> 20:15.540
You know, I straight up know why I remember being on LiveJournal and putting so much thought

20:15.540 --> 20:17.940
into what emotion I was feeling at that moment.

20:17.940 --> 20:20.100
So I knew what smiley face to pick at the end of it.

20:20.100 --> 20:21.540
I always wanted to be exotic.

20:21.540 --> 20:22.660
A terrible pile.

20:23.620 --> 20:24.340
You're a mess.

20:24.340 --> 20:25.220
You're both messes.

20:26.340 --> 20:27.380
I don't do that anymore now.

20:27.380 --> 20:30.100
I just keep all of those emoticons locked up inside my heart.

20:31.940 --> 20:32.660
You'll never know.

20:33.300 --> 20:34.820
You'll never know what I'm feeling right now.

20:34.820 --> 20:35.700
People are like, what are you feeling?

20:35.700 --> 20:36.580
I'm like, that's mine.

20:36.580 --> 20:37.300
That's mine.

20:37.300 --> 20:37.860
I feel quick.

20:37.860 --> 20:39.060
Oh, but shut it.

20:39.060 --> 20:40.420
It's my secret feeling.

20:40.420 --> 20:41.460
I was raised Baptist.

20:41.460 --> 20:45.620
So if I don't know what emotions I'm feeling at any given moment, I don't see why everybody

20:45.620 --> 20:46.420
else gets to.

20:46.420 --> 20:51.140
I barely even have the words to tell people I'm happy.

20:51.140 --> 20:54.020
I stifle all that stuff and then later I turn them into jokes.

20:55.780 --> 20:57.620
I turn them into sandwiches.

20:57.620 --> 21:04.740
My heart is like a mine where I put the sadness and then out comes the chuckle by them.

21:08.420 --> 21:09.140
Oh boy.

21:09.700 --> 21:11.060
Good show today, I think.

21:11.060 --> 21:12.100
It's going really well.

21:12.100 --> 21:13.620
Really, really crushing.

21:13.620 --> 21:14.100
Teens.

21:14.100 --> 21:14.740
Really?

21:14.740 --> 21:19.140
Teens.

21:19.140 --> 21:20.180
Christmas is coming.

21:20.740 --> 21:22.500
The goose is getting fast.

21:22.500 --> 21:28.100
And I have presents for my boyfriend and everyone in my family except my middle-est sister.

21:28.100 --> 21:28.820
Wow.

21:28.820 --> 21:31.460
People are, guys, are you, how's your Christmas shopping going?

21:32.100 --> 21:33.620
Are you like, are you?

21:33.620 --> 21:35.300
God's honest, haven't even started.

21:35.300 --> 21:35.780
Nor I.

21:35.780 --> 21:36.100
Okay.

21:36.100 --> 21:37.140
I got that Amazon Prime.

21:37.140 --> 21:39.860
I could do that shit on the 23rd and Christmas would be saved.

21:40.420 --> 21:42.500
I'm thinking just making ashtrays for everyone.

21:42.500 --> 21:43.140
Don't do that.

21:43.140 --> 21:43.780
I want shit.

21:43.780 --> 21:45.780
Make me an ashtray.

21:45.780 --> 21:46.100
Yeah.

21:47.940 --> 21:48.820
Teens.

21:48.820 --> 21:49.300
Teens.

21:50.580 --> 21:51.060
Go read it.

21:53.300 --> 21:58.980
My middle-est sister, we aren't close and she's a listener, so I plan on an awkward holiday season.

21:58.980 --> 21:59.380
No.

21:59.380 --> 22:02.980
Says we aren't close and we don't spend time together more than once a month,

22:02.980 --> 22:08.020
so it's difficult for me to decide on my own what she might like or find useful.

22:08.020 --> 22:12.020
I've asked her to list a few things she might like, but she hasn't offered any suggestions.

22:12.020 --> 22:16.900
What can I get my sister that she'll appreciate in case she doesn't tell me what she'd like in

22:16.900 --> 22:18.500
time to get it shipped by Christmas?

22:18.500 --> 22:21.140
That's from Christmas Confounded in Carolina.

22:22.500 --> 22:24.500
Are you fucking kidding?

22:24.500 --> 22:28.500
You've consulted the three people who know your sister less than you.

22:30.740 --> 22:32.100
We don't know her.

22:32.100 --> 22:32.580
What you know.

22:32.580 --> 22:35.620
If you're worried about someone getting a gift, anyone could suggest it was like,

22:35.620 --> 22:37.940
this is safe for everyone and anyone would like this.

22:38.580 --> 22:41.540
It's so obvious that that is what you did.

22:41.540 --> 22:43.300
Like, I got you some soap.

22:43.300 --> 22:44.580
Here's a slap chop.

22:44.580 --> 22:45.300
Like, thanks.

22:45.940 --> 22:46.420
Thank you.

22:46.980 --> 22:48.020
Thank you, I guess.

22:48.020 --> 22:50.740
I guess you were watching TV and saw it.

22:53.300 --> 22:56.740
Maybe get her a webcam and say, I want the two of us to be better connected.

22:56.740 --> 22:58.020
Oh, Justin.

22:58.020 --> 22:58.820
Slam dunk.

22:59.620 --> 23:00.340
I don't want.

23:01.060 --> 23:02.420
But maybe she doesn't like her.

23:02.420 --> 23:03.940
So let's operate on that too.

23:03.940 --> 23:09.140
Okay, so you could get her a something of the month club membership.

23:09.140 --> 23:13.140
Like, if she likes cheese or wine or something, chocolates.

23:14.820 --> 23:18.180
But see, that, once again, is just such a generic gift that says like,

23:18.180 --> 23:20.020
hey, I didn't know what else to get you.

23:20.020 --> 23:27.380
Well, not if they know that, like, we got Sidney's dad a beer of the month club because he likes beer.

23:27.380 --> 23:30.260
If it's something like, they're a big coffee drinker and they're really into coffee,

23:30.260 --> 23:34.100
and then going with a gourmet coffee of the month club, you know, might be a great way to go.

23:34.100 --> 23:38.020
Yeah, or if they're a raging alcoholic, get them the beer of the month club.

23:38.020 --> 23:45.380
You know, a lot of people have a coffee grinder that's not really good for them.

23:45.940 --> 23:48.020
Maybe get them a nice burr grinder.

23:48.580 --> 23:49.540
That's what you want.

23:49.540 --> 23:52.500
And some fresh coffee from your local coffisserie.

23:53.940 --> 23:57.060
What about, what's that Scentsy shit that you guys are always talking about?

23:58.260 --> 23:59.220
Scentsy, man.

23:59.220 --> 24:05.700
Scentsy is a great present, actually, because you get a warm worm, you get some wafers.

24:05.700 --> 24:10.100
Some wafers. Right now I'm melting, what do I got in there?

24:10.100 --> 24:11.140
Christmas cottage.

24:11.780 --> 24:13.780
No, no, no, it's the holidays, Griffin, please.

24:13.780 --> 24:14.500
It's the holidays.

24:14.500 --> 24:15.220
Sorry.

24:15.220 --> 24:21.860
I got Christmas cottage up in there, and later I think I'm going to swap in Festival of Trees.

24:21.860 --> 24:23.220
This is whatever you want.

24:23.220 --> 24:23.860
It's really nice.

24:24.740 --> 24:28.340
You could also get her some kind of decorative dagger.

24:29.540 --> 24:32.340
Okay, so you're saying let's go to the local Excalibur,

24:32.340 --> 24:37.060
and let's buy her maybe a pewter dragon statue with fake-

24:37.060 --> 24:40.420
It's just been a while since I mentioned sexual edge, and business is really fucked up.

24:40.420 --> 24:41.540
Oh, God, no.

24:48.660 --> 24:50.820
Are we getting that Scentsy money yet?

24:50.820 --> 24:52.900
Are we getting that Scentsy endorsement money?

24:52.900 --> 24:54.900
You guys know we got that Genesis Today hook.

24:55.700 --> 24:59.380
You know I got two big bags of Genesis Today swag here waiting for you.

25:00.020 --> 25:00.900
Oh, good.

25:00.900 --> 25:01.220
Yeah.

25:01.220 --> 25:02.580
Oh, so you've got it, definitely.

25:02.580 --> 25:05.380
We've got the Genesis Today super fruit gummies.

25:05.380 --> 25:09.460
You've got the clicky pins, and the pins that you can pull out the information sheet.

25:09.460 --> 25:10.180
No, no, no.

25:10.180 --> 25:11.300
These are all edible.

25:11.300 --> 25:14.740
We're talking about omega-3 fatty acid vitamin C chewables.

25:14.740 --> 25:19.140
We're talking about fucking super fruit immunity-boosting gummies.

25:19.780 --> 25:24.820
So when you say you got bags, though, do you mean you just have grocery bags full of pills?

25:24.820 --> 25:28.020
Two Genesis Today branded canvas bags.

25:28.740 --> 25:29.940
Just filled with pills.

25:29.940 --> 25:31.780
It's full of health, is what it is.

25:31.780 --> 25:37.540
Do you have anything in there that's like chock full of B12, another sort of B5?

25:37.540 --> 25:41.860
I have a fucking acai chew with 2,000% acai daily value.

25:43.140 --> 25:44.180
I just really need to set my energy free.

25:44.180 --> 25:44.680
My kidneys!

25:49.540 --> 25:52.020
You know that's how men just get their powers.

25:52.020 --> 25:54.820
You'll feel all the tissues in your body loosen and then tighten.

25:56.020 --> 25:56.900
Where did that come from?

25:56.900 --> 25:57.940
It's the acai.

25:57.940 --> 26:00.820
Can you just hand your sister like a $50 bill?

26:02.020 --> 26:04.100
I don't know you very well, so here's some money.

26:04.100 --> 26:05.780
Hey, you know what everybody likes?

26:05.780 --> 26:06.500
Money.

26:06.500 --> 26:07.140
Don't rate me.

26:09.140 --> 26:10.740
Starbucks gift card's always nice.

26:10.740 --> 26:11.700
No, it's not.

26:11.700 --> 26:13.780
You get to go there, get a burr grinder.

26:13.780 --> 26:14.340
Here's the thing.

26:16.420 --> 26:20.660
The best thing you could do, so you asked your sister what she would like,

26:21.700 --> 26:26.100
and you're waiting on a list back from her, maybe ask around to other places.

26:26.100 --> 26:31.060
You know, ask your parents, ask your other siblings, what are you getting her?

26:31.780 --> 26:38.500
Maybe you can do a tandem gift where they're getting her a new set of something,

26:38.500 --> 26:40.580
so you get a complimentary set of something.

26:43.460 --> 26:47.140
It's Christmas, and the point is that just get her something you think she would like,

26:47.140 --> 26:49.140
and I'm sure it'll be great.

26:50.260 --> 26:51.700
Travis, she doesn't know her very well.

26:51.700 --> 26:54.900
You didn't listen to the core conceit of this question.

26:54.900 --> 27:00.340
So then you have to go off of your own judgment and say like,

27:00.340 --> 27:02.980
I think she would like this because I would like it.

27:02.980 --> 27:05.700
Can you steal something from her and then return it?

27:08.340 --> 27:10.420
Get her something that's already in her house,

27:10.420 --> 27:13.140
which will have doubles, but at least you'll know it's something she likes.

27:13.940 --> 27:14.100
Yeah.

27:14.100 --> 27:14.820
That's not a good idea.

27:14.820 --> 27:16.100
That's a stupid idea.

27:16.100 --> 27:16.740
Stupid.

27:17.700 --> 27:20.020
Unless it's something that's awesome to have doubles of.

27:20.980 --> 27:22.100
Oh, right.

27:22.100 --> 27:25.940
Like a picture of two werewolves fucking.

27:25.940 --> 27:29.380
Or two lonely werewolves put the pictures next to each other,

27:29.940 --> 27:32.580
cut out the sides of the frames,

27:32.580 --> 27:34.260
wait for the magic pictures,

27:34.260 --> 27:37.060
wait for the werewolf sex to happen.

27:37.060 --> 27:40.260
Wait for the two werewolves to have sex in each other's paintings.

27:41.460 --> 27:44.420
Wait for the Harry Potter magic painting crossover werewolf fuck.

27:46.340 --> 27:48.020
Get her something really terrible,

27:48.020 --> 27:52.180
and then you'll be giving her the best gift you can give anyone,

27:52.180 --> 27:55.540
which is the right to complain about the shitty gift you got them all year.

27:55.540 --> 27:56.180
Yeah.

27:56.180 --> 27:59.620
And you'll be giving everyone else the present of

27:59.620 --> 28:02.740
knowing that their present to anyone else wasn't the worst thing.

28:02.740 --> 28:02.980
Yeah.

28:02.980 --> 28:04.340
Fall on this grenade for her.

28:04.340 --> 28:05.700
Get them nothing.

28:05.700 --> 28:10.180
And then when she goes back and talks to the girls around at the steno pool,

28:10.180 --> 28:11.140
she could say,

28:11.140 --> 28:14.900
oh, and my younger sister, she's a real peach.

28:14.900 --> 28:16.260
Guess what she got me?

28:16.260 --> 28:19.860
Did a big box of diddly squat.

28:19.860 --> 28:21.380
Yeah, just give her an empty box.

28:21.380 --> 28:22.820
And when she opens it, say,

28:22.820 --> 28:24.740
you should've gotten me that list quicker, huh?

28:24.740 --> 28:24.980
Yeah.

28:26.580 --> 28:28.420
Christmas morning is the perfect time to be vindictive.

28:28.420 --> 28:28.660
I've always said that.

28:28.660 --> 28:30.820
Yeah, let's turn Christmas lesson into an object lesson.

28:30.820 --> 28:33.220
What about a box with a note in it that says,

28:33.220 --> 28:34.580
I wish I knew you better.

28:35.620 --> 28:37.460
That's the real gift is getting a note.

28:37.460 --> 28:39.860
Get her a gift certificate for one sister.

28:39.860 --> 28:40.100
Yeah.

28:40.820 --> 28:43.140
Or like 20 free phone calls.

28:43.140 --> 28:43.380
Yeah.

28:43.940 --> 28:44.660
Well, you'd have to go-

28:44.660 --> 28:47.060
But to her, you gotta clarify,

28:47.060 --> 28:48.820
you're not like paying her long distance bill.

28:50.100 --> 28:50.980
That would get awkward.

28:53.780 --> 28:54.580
Don't get her anything.

28:55.940 --> 28:56.820
She should've been better contact.

28:56.820 --> 28:58.260
Just don't show up to Christmas.

28:58.980 --> 29:00.580
Christmas is the time where,

29:01.380 --> 29:03.460
when it started a long time ago,

29:04.900 --> 29:08.100
the wise men gave Jesus those really nice gifts,

29:08.100 --> 29:11.700
even though he was a baby and he couldn't give them shit.

29:11.700 --> 29:12.100
Yeah.

29:12.100 --> 29:12.500
So-

29:12.500 --> 29:14.980
Nor can you do it, like what are you doing giving frankincense

29:14.980 --> 29:16.020
to a baby?

29:16.020 --> 29:16.340
Yeah.

29:16.340 --> 29:17.940
Babies eat that and it will kill them.

29:17.940 --> 29:20.500
It kills them instantly.

29:20.500 --> 29:21.780
The toxics to a baby.

29:21.780 --> 29:23.780
But what they were doing was they were making Jesus

29:23.780 --> 29:25.860
feel guilty from the very start.

29:25.860 --> 29:28.260
They wanted him to feel indebted to them.

29:28.260 --> 29:30.100
So he would, they didn't know how it was gonna work

29:30.100 --> 29:31.060
with the cross and whatnot.

29:32.260 --> 29:34.980
But it did have a pretty epic payoff, I would say.

29:34.980 --> 29:37.220
Well, they didn't know how it was all gonna work.

29:37.220 --> 29:39.140
So they thought, well, we want this guy in our pocket.

29:39.140 --> 29:41.700
That's a scene that they usually cut out of that story

29:41.700 --> 29:44.980
where the wise men show back up 33 years later and say like,

29:44.980 --> 29:47.620
hey, remember when we gave you that stuff?

29:48.260 --> 29:50.100
Yeah, we're gonna have to call in that favor.

29:50.100 --> 29:51.700
They all got together beforehand.

29:51.700 --> 29:53.940
They say, Daryl, I like this kid.

29:53.940 --> 29:54.260
Yeah.

29:54.260 --> 29:55.780
I want juice with this kid.

29:55.780 --> 29:56.740
It must've been tricky.

29:56.740 --> 29:58.580
Baby Jesus don't come with the rule book.

29:59.300 --> 30:00.980
You don't know how all that stuff operates,

30:00.980 --> 30:02.820
the heavenly salvation.

30:02.820 --> 30:05.940
Baby Jesus is like the suit from Greatest American Hero.

30:05.940 --> 30:07.460
Nobody knew how it was gonna go down.

30:07.460 --> 30:08.900
Yeah, but it happened.

30:09.460 --> 30:10.180
But it happened.

30:10.180 --> 30:13.060
But the wise men, the reason they got him such nice gifts

30:13.060 --> 30:17.060
is so they could feel superior to Jesus for a little while.

30:17.060 --> 30:18.500
And then he would be indebted to them

30:18.500 --> 30:19.620
and Jesus would feel guilty.

30:19.620 --> 30:21.380
I mean, he didn't have those emotions at the beginning.

30:21.380 --> 30:23.300
He was just a baby, but he would feel guilty later

30:23.300 --> 30:25.060
about the nice gifts that he didn't return.

30:25.060 --> 30:25.380
Actually-

30:25.380 --> 30:27.620
Is there any parallel we can draw between Jesus

30:27.620 --> 30:28.900
and the suit from Condor Man?

30:29.940 --> 30:31.860
I do not think so, Travis.

30:31.860 --> 30:35.140
I do not know what you're talking about is the problem for me.

30:35.140 --> 30:36.820
If my problem is I have no idea what you're talking about.

30:36.820 --> 30:40.260
I can't get into a riff about where Travis explains

30:41.300 --> 30:42.500
the film Condor Man.

30:42.500 --> 30:44.820
I can't, I don't think it's a great fit for our show.

30:44.820 --> 30:45.860
Can I talk about the car and a van?

30:47.460 --> 30:50.580
Can we talk about literally anything else?

30:50.580 --> 30:50.820
Okay.

30:50.820 --> 30:51.540
Sure, of course.

30:54.180 --> 30:56.020
God, Christmas gifts are the pits for people

30:56.020 --> 30:57.460
you don't know very well, huh?

30:57.460 --> 30:57.700
Yeah.

30:57.700 --> 30:58.900
It's just the worst.

30:58.900 --> 31:01.620
Why don't you give a preemptive gift,

31:01.620 --> 31:03.380
call her and say you don't have to get me anything

31:03.380 --> 31:04.420
and I'm not gonna get you anything

31:04.420 --> 31:05.940
and let's just not worry about it.

31:05.940 --> 31:07.300
Cause that would be the best gift anybody could get.

31:07.300 --> 31:08.420
Oh, just cancel it out?

31:09.060 --> 31:12.020
Yeah, say like, listen, I don't like you, you don't like me.

31:13.460 --> 31:14.340
No gifts this year.

31:14.340 --> 31:15.940
Tell her that you bought her a goat

31:16.500 --> 31:17.700
through Heifer International

31:17.700 --> 31:19.940
and she's like, doesn't that usually come with a certificate?

31:19.940 --> 31:22.420
You'd be like, no, no, no, no, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

31:22.420 --> 31:22.820
It's cool.

31:22.820 --> 31:23.940
There's a special goat.

31:23.940 --> 31:24.260
It's cool.

31:24.260 --> 31:26.180
Tell them to use that certificate overhead

31:26.180 --> 31:28.420
to donate to the family so they can have some porridge.

31:30.340 --> 31:32.660
And if all else fails, go on ThinkGeek

31:32.660 --> 31:34.020
and get her something awesome.

31:34.020 --> 31:34.900
Okay, boom.

31:34.900 --> 31:36.820
And that's what ThinkGeek exists for.

31:36.820 --> 31:38.340
It exists for like getting her some sweet ass

31:38.340 --> 31:39.700
astronaut ice cream or something.

31:39.700 --> 31:42.100
Yeah, everybody loves astronaut ice cream.

31:42.740 --> 31:44.100
When they 12.

31:45.860 --> 31:47.540
Good one, good thing.

31:47.540 --> 31:50.180
My new burn is called When They 12.

31:50.820 --> 31:53.620
Yeah, it's sort of a riff on teens.

31:53.620 --> 31:56.660
Yeah, teens, teens, preteens.

31:57.860 --> 31:59.220
Don't go trying to change,

31:59.220 --> 32:00.980
we just gave birth to this meme

32:00.980 --> 32:05.620
and you're trying to fucking chop it and screw it.

32:05.620 --> 32:08.180
In no way am I trying to chop and screw teens.

32:14.660 --> 32:17.460
If you want a show that is not like our show,

32:17.460 --> 32:21.060
that does not make terrible things like that happen

32:21.060 --> 32:21.780
with their mouths,

32:22.820 --> 32:24.660
boy, have we got a recommendation for you.

32:24.660 --> 32:32.580
Hello there, my name is Graham Clark.

32:32.580 --> 32:33.780
And I'm Dave Shumka.

32:33.780 --> 32:36.020
And together we host a podcast called

32:36.020 --> 32:37.620
Stop Podcasting Yourself.

32:37.620 --> 32:40.180
This is a file that you download from the internet

32:40.180 --> 32:42.020
and then you listen to it in your pod.

32:42.020 --> 32:43.460
What's that about, you ask?

32:43.460 --> 32:44.900
Well, who are you to ask?

32:44.900 --> 32:46.020
Who do you think you are?

32:46.020 --> 32:48.020
Yeah, get lost, bozo.

32:48.020 --> 32:50.820
We're a couple of stand up comedians in Vancouver,

32:50.820 --> 32:52.420
British Columbia, Canada.

32:52.420 --> 32:55.060
And every week we bring a guest on the show.

32:55.060 --> 32:56.340
Sometimes they're Canadian,

32:56.340 --> 32:57.620
sometimes they're not,

32:57.620 --> 32:58.980
sometimes they're a ghost.

32:58.980 --> 33:02.260
It's like you're sitting in on a friendly afternoon chat.

33:02.260 --> 33:05.060
Plus we're Canadian, so you get a tax break.

33:06.260 --> 33:09.940
You can find us on iTunes or online at maximumfun.org.

33:14.820 --> 33:15.540
Celebrities.

33:17.220 --> 33:17.940
Who needs them?

33:18.580 --> 33:19.220
Who needs them?

33:19.220 --> 33:20.340
We do, desperately.

33:20.340 --> 33:20.660
Yes.

33:20.660 --> 33:21.380
Yes.

33:21.380 --> 33:23.860
I am so excited about this celebrity.

33:24.660 --> 33:26.260
Yeah, this is a really big one for us.

33:27.540 --> 33:33.540
We ask our, every week we start the show off with the hit song

33:33.540 --> 33:35.300
It's a Departure from the Long Winners.

33:35.300 --> 33:38.900
And we know that so many of you have gotten into the Long Winners

33:38.900 --> 33:41.540
as a result of, well, us, our personal influence.

33:41.540 --> 33:42.340
You're welcome.

33:42.340 --> 33:42.900
You're welcome.

33:44.260 --> 33:47.380
But this week we actually have a celebrity question

33:47.380 --> 33:51.620
from Mr. John Roderick of the Long Winters.

33:53.140 --> 33:56.180
Hello, my brother, my brother and me brothers.

33:56.820 --> 33:58.500
This is John Roderick calling.

33:58.500 --> 34:01.700
And my question for you is,

34:01.700 --> 34:05.940
I want to learn to be an eBay retailer.

34:05.940 --> 34:10.100
I have a lot of junk that I've collected

34:10.100 --> 34:11.540
because I'm a collector.

34:12.820 --> 34:14.500
And now I'm looking around my house

34:14.500 --> 34:18.180
and I'm realizing that I'm not, I've crossed the line

34:18.740 --> 34:20.980
from being a collector to being a crazy person

34:20.980 --> 34:22.100
in a house full of crap.

34:22.820 --> 34:27.860
And so what better way to unload the crap than to go on eBay?

34:27.860 --> 34:31.060
But I can't stand being on eBay whenever I'm there.

34:31.060 --> 34:32.340
It just confuses me.

34:33.300 --> 34:35.060
And it doesn't fill me with delight

34:36.260 --> 34:38.580
like being in a room full of crap does.

34:38.580 --> 34:40.740
So what I'm trying to do is transition

34:40.740 --> 34:43.300
from being a crazy person in a room full of crap

34:43.300 --> 34:47.380
to a wealthy person in an empty room.

34:48.660 --> 34:51.140
And I think eBay might be the way,

34:51.700 --> 34:54.820
but I don't have the first idea how to begin.

34:54.820 --> 34:58.100
So any suggestion or advice for me?

34:58.660 --> 35:00.580
Thanks so much, homies.

35:03.700 --> 35:06.740
Thank you, John Roderick, for that question.

35:07.460 --> 35:10.660
You have gotten to us just in time

35:10.660 --> 35:13.220
in time because you were about to make

35:13.220 --> 35:14.980
a terrible, terrible mistake.

35:14.980 --> 35:15.700
You almost did it.

35:16.500 --> 35:17.460
Almost made a mistake.

35:17.460 --> 35:18.420
I was so close.

35:18.420 --> 35:19.140
Here's the thing.

35:19.700 --> 35:27.460
No one puts you on TV for reasonably getting rid of your stuff.

35:27.460 --> 35:28.980
Yeah, yeah.

35:28.980 --> 35:31.620
I'm glad we're on the same page here, Justin.

35:32.340 --> 35:34.260
Yeah, you gotta lean into it.

35:34.260 --> 35:38.180
You know that promo, you know that digital ink,

35:38.180 --> 35:41.300
that TV ink of getting on the hit show Hoarders

35:41.300 --> 35:42.900
is going to be great for your band.

35:42.900 --> 35:44.580
It's going to be great for your image.

35:44.580 --> 35:45.700
Well, not only that-

35:45.700 --> 35:47.540
Hold on, one second.

35:47.540 --> 35:49.300
I'm not exactly sure it'll be great for your image.

35:49.940 --> 35:50.420
Not sure-

35:50.420 --> 35:51.220
What the fuck?

35:51.220 --> 35:53.780
People kept, people talked about that fucker

35:53.780 --> 35:55.860
from the Libertines for like two years

35:55.860 --> 35:58.100
just because he had such terrible drug addiction.

35:58.100 --> 35:59.620
You don't think people are going to chat up

35:59.620 --> 36:02.260
the lead singer of a hit indie rock band

36:02.260 --> 36:03.700
who is also a Hoarder?

36:03.700 --> 36:03.860
Hey-

36:03.860 --> 36:06.660
I feel like Hoarders is like just a hair's breadth

36:06.660 --> 36:08.420
separated from MTV Cribs.

36:09.460 --> 36:09.780
Maybe-

36:09.780 --> 36:11.220
It's just like MTV Cribs

36:11.220 --> 36:12.820
if they just had a bunch of shit around their house.

36:12.820 --> 36:14.500
Oh my God, is that hair important?

36:15.140 --> 36:15.860
Oh my God.

36:16.500 --> 36:17.060
Yeah.

36:17.060 --> 36:19.140
Nobody's going to want to be the guy who's like

36:19.140 --> 36:20.420
people come up to on the street and it's like,

36:20.420 --> 36:22.020
hey, I saw you on Hoarders.

36:22.020 --> 36:24.900
Your house looks like fucking Scrooge McDuck's vault

36:24.900 --> 36:26.980
if Scrooge McDuck were a homeless person.

36:26.980 --> 36:27.220
And-

36:27.220 --> 36:28.500
But your albums rule.

36:28.500 --> 36:30.660
Your albums are great is the thing.

36:30.660 --> 36:31.460
Your albums are so-

36:31.460 --> 36:32.900
Think about, think about,

36:32.900 --> 36:34.900
you never see the headline in the paper

36:34.900 --> 36:39.380
for a hit indie rocker killed by a mountain of air.

36:39.380 --> 36:39.620
Yeah.

36:39.620 --> 36:43.220
It's gotta be old newspaper or shoe boxes

36:43.220 --> 36:44.900
filled with toenail clippings.

36:44.900 --> 36:47.700
Pile of 45 gramophones topples on.

36:49.700 --> 36:51.860
The number one thing is you can't-

36:51.860 --> 36:55.220
and this is the mistake that so many Hoarders make,

36:55.940 --> 36:56.900
which by the way,

36:56.900 --> 36:58.580
we are definitely, definitely leaning

36:58.580 --> 36:59.620
towards you becoming a Hoarder.

37:00.660 --> 37:02.180
You can't go organic.

37:02.740 --> 37:04.580
You got to keep the organics out of it

37:04.580 --> 37:07.060
because then you're a dirty, dirty, it's dirty.

37:07.060 --> 37:07.540
Yeah.

37:07.540 --> 37:07.940
Then you're-

37:07.940 --> 37:08.420
Shameful.

37:08.420 --> 37:10.580
Then you got a compost home and nobody wants that.

37:10.580 --> 37:11.940
Right. Nobody wants that.

37:11.940 --> 37:14.100
You're gonna find decomposed cats

37:14.660 --> 37:19.460
and old containers of yogurt.

37:19.460 --> 37:20.660
It's terrible.

37:20.660 --> 37:23.700
Do you think that there is a style of hoarding

37:23.700 --> 37:25.940
you could do that would actually be awesome?

37:25.940 --> 37:29.780
Like I hoard old Nintendo Power magazines.

37:29.780 --> 37:30.580
Oh my God, yes.

37:31.540 --> 37:31.860
Yeah.

37:31.860 --> 37:33.540
But what he's saying, I think,

37:33.540 --> 37:35.780
is that like that does make you a collector.

37:35.780 --> 37:38.420
What he's saying is that if you collect enough things,

37:38.980 --> 37:40.500
you're a Hoarder.

37:40.500 --> 37:41.620
Well, doesn't that just mean

37:41.620 --> 37:43.060
it's time to move into a bigger house?

37:43.940 --> 37:44.340
No, it doesn't mean that.

37:44.340 --> 37:45.300
You're saying it's all relative.

37:45.300 --> 37:48.340
You're saying if you have 20,000 square feet

37:48.980 --> 37:51.300
and you fill it with a thousand square feet

37:51.300 --> 37:55.780
of old newspaper clippings and coupons from the 1970s,

37:55.780 --> 37:57.060
you're no longer a Hoarder.

37:57.060 --> 37:59.620
You are just an eccentric person with a large house.

37:59.620 --> 38:00.180
Exactly.

38:00.180 --> 38:05.140
If you're like, and this is my room for Perfect Strangers memorabilia,

38:05.860 --> 38:07.700
then, you know, you're not a weirdo.

38:07.700 --> 38:08.980
But if you're like, this is my house,

38:08.980 --> 38:10.900
which is floor to ceiling covered

38:10.900 --> 38:13.060
with Perfect Strangers memorabilia,

38:13.060 --> 38:13.860
you got a problem.

38:13.860 --> 38:16.020
Now you've stumbled onto a hit new idea,

38:16.020 --> 38:17.940
what you like to call a museum.

38:17.940 --> 38:21.300
Like you're creating more problems.

38:21.300 --> 38:22.180
Then you got overhead.

38:22.180 --> 38:24.180
You have to get special tax classification.

38:24.180 --> 38:25.060
Oh, what about this?

38:25.060 --> 38:26.420
Oh, when someone's like, you're a Hoarder,

38:26.420 --> 38:29.060
say, no, no, no, I'm working on an art installation.

38:29.060 --> 38:29.620
Yeah.

38:29.620 --> 38:30.260
Ooh.

38:30.260 --> 38:31.460
I mean, it's kind of hard.

38:31.460 --> 38:33.060
I think we're being a little myopic

38:33.060 --> 38:34.340
by just focusing on Hoarders.

38:34.340 --> 38:36.020
I feel like there's other reality TV shows

38:36.020 --> 38:39.060
that we can use to help John get rid of his stuff

38:39.700 --> 38:41.780
and make some money off of it.

38:41.780 --> 38:44.500
Like, I'm thinking there's the triumvirate, right?

38:44.500 --> 38:45.780
You got Pawn Stars.

38:45.780 --> 38:46.740
Drop that shit on them.

38:46.740 --> 38:47.940
They'll give you Mad Skrilla.

38:47.940 --> 38:49.540
That is their catchphrase.

38:49.540 --> 38:53.140
You got American Pickers.

38:53.140 --> 38:54.420
Call it the American Pickers, guys.

38:54.420 --> 38:57.460
They'll just swoop in and give you fair trade for your stuff.

38:57.460 --> 38:59.940
And, of course, Hail Billy Hand Fishing.

39:02.820 --> 39:07.060
There's fucking storage wars.

39:07.060 --> 39:08.020
You got storage wars.

39:08.020 --> 39:09.460
Just put all your shit in a storage unit

39:09.460 --> 39:12.100
and then go delinquent on the payments and then it's gone.

39:12.100 --> 39:13.460
You don't get any money for it.

39:14.020 --> 39:16.340
But your stuff gets on TV

39:16.340 --> 39:18.100
and you get to watch your memories picked over

39:18.100 --> 39:19.540
by heartless, heartless men.

39:19.540 --> 39:20.900
And you could go on LA Ink

39:20.900 --> 39:22.660
and get tattoos of all the stuff you have.

39:22.660 --> 39:24.020
You could go on Real Housewives

39:24.020 --> 39:27.940
and marry a sweet, beautiful woman.

39:27.940 --> 39:28.500
Think about that.

39:28.500 --> 39:29.460
Think about that, John.

39:29.460 --> 39:32.660
You could be the one guy with the beard who was a hoarder

39:32.660 --> 39:35.620
and married the one from Sweet Housewives of Atlanta.

39:35.620 --> 39:37.540
And then was on Ace of Cakes.

39:37.540 --> 39:38.980
He was on Ace of Cakes.

39:38.980 --> 39:41.380
We wanted to celebrate you decided to be a hoarder.

39:41.380 --> 39:43.300
I want a cake that's just covered in shit.

39:43.300 --> 39:45.300
Sweet Housewives of Biloxi this week.

39:45.940 --> 39:46.660
It was great.

39:47.220 --> 39:49.300
Those sweet, sweet women marry John Roderick.

39:50.900 --> 39:51.620
All of them.

39:51.620 --> 39:52.740
And then they were on Sister Wives.

39:52.740 --> 39:54.660
Did you see Sister Wives this week?

39:54.660 --> 39:56.260
Cody, he's out.

39:56.260 --> 39:56.820
Cody's out.

39:56.820 --> 39:57.860
John Roderick's in.

39:57.860 --> 39:59.380
He just, he just swooped in.

39:59.380 --> 40:00.740
It was the world's biggest divorce.

40:00.740 --> 40:01.700
It was like the quickening.

40:01.700 --> 40:03.460
He just swooped in and he got a bunch of wives

40:03.460 --> 40:04.660
and like 35 kids.

40:05.380 --> 40:06.500
Oh, he's hoarding kids.

40:06.500 --> 40:07.460
He's hoarding kids.

40:08.020 --> 40:10.100
My house is floor to ceiling covered with kids.

40:10.100 --> 40:10.820
There's spawn everywhere.

40:10.820 --> 40:11.300
Now, listen.

40:11.300 --> 40:12.020
Now, listen, John.

40:12.580 --> 40:13.940
If you want to put kids on eBay.

40:14.820 --> 40:16.020
It's going to go fast.

40:16.020 --> 40:17.140
We're going to talk about this.

40:17.140 --> 40:18.180
I got to, I know a guy.

40:18.900 --> 40:21.060
Let's talk, talk to my guy, Rico.

40:21.060 --> 40:22.260
If you have to take care of me.

40:22.260 --> 40:23.860
If you have to use eBay, the trick is,

40:23.860 --> 40:27.780
as somebody who used eBay once to,

40:27.780 --> 40:29.140
I think I bought a DVD.

40:29.140 --> 40:31.460
And then the second time was I sold some Pokemon cards

40:31.460 --> 40:33.460
and they asked me to pay a fee for selling shit.

40:33.460 --> 40:34.500
And I was like, no.

40:34.500 --> 40:37.460
And I got banned from eBay forever.

40:38.420 --> 40:40.420
But you got to make it seem like a place.

40:40.980 --> 40:43.860
Your space, your sales space has to seem like a place where

40:45.140 --> 40:47.620
it seems like you're not trying to fuck the user

40:47.620 --> 40:49.060
right through their pants.

40:49.060 --> 40:51.220
You got to make it seem like a safe space for them.

40:51.220 --> 40:52.980
Like you are actually going to give them the things

40:52.980 --> 40:53.780
that they want.

40:53.780 --> 40:54.340
And you know what?

40:54.340 --> 40:56.100
Why not use your name on there?

40:56.100 --> 41:00.260
People can think you're not selling old newspaper clippings.

41:00.260 --> 41:01.940
You're selling rock memorabilia.

41:03.140 --> 41:03.540
Right.

41:03.540 --> 41:04.980
It's all rock memorabilia.

41:04.980 --> 41:05.620
Everything you own is rock memorabilia.

41:05.620 --> 41:07.700
Whatever you do, be careful that if you take a picture

41:07.700 --> 41:09.620
of something that is shiny and reflective,

41:09.620 --> 41:11.700
that you are dressed in that reflection.

41:11.700 --> 41:12.180
Or not.

41:12.180 --> 41:12.340
Yeah.

41:12.340 --> 41:12.980
You don't want to become an,

41:14.580 --> 41:15.620
everybody's into something different.

41:15.620 --> 41:16.180
That picture is not a rock memorabilia.

41:16.180 --> 41:18.100
Hey, is that a picture of a werewolf in the background?

41:19.300 --> 41:20.580
What is it doing to him?

41:20.580 --> 41:21.780
I'll take it.

41:21.780 --> 41:22.420
I'll take it.

41:23.060 --> 41:24.980
I'll take that one and its brother next door.

41:25.940 --> 41:28.260
Hey, I'm a 25 year old male.

41:28.260 --> 41:32.180
At work, I share a small office with two lovely young ladies

41:32.180 --> 41:34.660
about my age, both of whom are close friends of mine

41:34.660 --> 41:35.540
that I adore.

41:35.540 --> 41:37.780
But the amount of girl talk and estrogen in the room

41:37.780 --> 41:39.860
can quickly become overwhelming.

41:39.860 --> 41:42.660
Unfortunately, there aren't really any dudes at work

41:42.660 --> 41:43.700
that I can nerd out with.

41:43.700 --> 41:44.820
I need a dude outlet.

41:45.780 --> 41:48.980
What can I do to get the old testosterone pumping at work?

41:48.980 --> 41:50.980
That's from smothered in the south.

41:50.980 --> 41:54.660
Okay, here's, this is where I'm going to

41:55.860 --> 41:58.500
completely go outside of what you asked

41:59.140 --> 42:01.540
and say that basically this would be like

42:01.540 --> 42:04.660
if in World War II, an American soldier was like,

42:04.660 --> 42:06.660
I'm stuck with all these Germans all day

42:06.660 --> 42:08.740
listening to all their plans and secrets.

42:11.940 --> 42:15.380
You are behind enemy lines collecting information.

42:15.380 --> 42:16.660
For the rest of us.

42:16.660 --> 42:17.540
Yes.

42:17.540 --> 42:19.540
Find out what they're talking about

42:19.540 --> 42:21.380
and what is going on in there.

42:21.380 --> 42:23.220
I don't, did you guys even know

42:23.220 --> 42:25.220
that they have a thing called a brood pouch?

42:26.420 --> 42:27.780
This is all new information.

42:29.460 --> 42:30.340
Do you know where the brood pouch is?

42:30.340 --> 42:32.820
It's also possible the women are feeding you misinformation.

42:34.100 --> 42:35.700
Which is actually one of their names.

42:35.700 --> 42:38.260
The jelly that I've been producing from my brood pouch

42:38.260 --> 42:41.060
has been really opaque lately.

42:41.060 --> 42:41.940
I'm worried.

42:43.460 --> 42:45.220
Oh, Travis, don't get it.

42:45.220 --> 42:46.820
It's a natural, beautiful part of life.

42:46.820 --> 42:49.540
The brood pouch is beautiful, natural.

42:50.100 --> 42:51.940
Now, for actual helpful information,

42:51.940 --> 42:54.420
is it possible that there's like a crossover thing

42:54.420 --> 42:55.780
where like you can talk about James Bond?

42:55.780 --> 42:58.340
No, no, Travis, there's nothing that both men and women

42:58.340 --> 42:59.140
like at the same time.

43:01.940 --> 43:02.980
Don't be ridiculous.

43:03.700 --> 43:05.460
Oh wait, there's a billion things.

43:05.460 --> 43:06.580
Top Chef for one.

43:09.220 --> 43:10.500
Just to pick one of the things.

43:10.500 --> 43:13.060
Just to pick one of the hundred-drillion things

43:13.060 --> 43:14.900
that there are that men and women like together.

43:14.900 --> 43:18.660
Yeah, and if I'm correct, a trillion is a trillion trillion

43:18.660 --> 43:19.460
if I'm not mistaken.

43:19.460 --> 43:21.140
All the trillions that there could possibly be.

43:21.140 --> 43:23.220
It's a number only girls know about, so you can't.

43:24.260 --> 43:25.780
Men are from Mars, guys.

43:25.780 --> 43:28.500
Sports, ladies like sports too sometimes.

43:30.740 --> 43:33.860
How about Top Chef?

43:33.860 --> 43:34.980
Just talk about Top Chef.

43:34.980 --> 43:38.020
That can last you like an entire day's worth of conversation.

43:38.660 --> 43:40.500
How about like any movies ever?

43:41.300 --> 43:42.020
Movies are good.

43:42.020 --> 43:43.380
Well, not any movie.

43:43.380 --> 43:43.940
Yeah.

43:43.940 --> 43:46.500
Some movies girls aren't allowed to see and vice versa.

43:46.500 --> 43:47.220
That's true.

43:47.220 --> 43:51.060
I've been trying to see Fry Green Tomatoes for 15 years now.

43:51.060 --> 43:52.180
I would love to see Love Actually,

43:52.180 --> 43:53.700
but I can't get my passport cleared.

43:53.700 --> 43:56.180
I'm imagining Sally Field just runs in and is like,

43:56.180 --> 43:58.900
no, slaps it out of your hand.

43:58.900 --> 43:59.940
Excuse me, ladies.

43:59.940 --> 44:01.860
I hate to interrupt our conversation,

44:01.860 --> 44:04.020
but I believe a boy has entered the room

44:04.020 --> 44:05.620
where our film is airing.

44:07.060 --> 44:09.140
She breaks the fourth wall like Zack Morris.

44:10.420 --> 44:11.060
Time out.

44:11.060 --> 44:14.260
Time out, Sissy Spacek, who may or may not be in this film.

44:17.060 --> 44:19.060
Calm down, woman from Jurassic Park.

44:26.100 --> 44:27.380
Ladies, just so you know,

44:27.380 --> 44:33.860
Jurassic Park is a movie with dinosaurs and Laura Dern in it.

44:34.980 --> 44:35.700
Sorry, ladies.

44:35.700 --> 44:36.260
I didn't-

44:36.260 --> 44:37.620
It's so good.

44:38.900 --> 44:40.100
I wish you could see it.

44:40.100 --> 44:41.300
I wish you guys could see it.

44:41.300 --> 44:43.300
I feel like it would really bridge a lot of gaps.

44:43.300 --> 44:43.800
Right.

44:46.020 --> 44:48.340
Hey, guys, let's tear down these walls, huh?

44:48.340 --> 44:51.940
I sort of like what I imagine how Stella got her groove back.

44:53.380 --> 44:54.820
I wouldn't know, guys.

44:54.820 --> 44:55.540
I wouldn't know.

44:55.540 --> 44:56.420
I'm guessing, but-

44:56.420 --> 44:59.860
I'm hoping that whatever comes after Blu-ray has a feature

44:59.860 --> 45:01.540
where if you're watching Fry Green Tomatoes

45:01.540 --> 45:02.660
and a man walks into the room,

45:02.660 --> 45:05.060
just like Kathy Bates just looks into the camera

45:05.060 --> 45:07.460
and just stops talking mid-sentence until-

45:07.460 --> 45:10.820
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

45:10.820 --> 45:11.320
He's here.

45:13.140 --> 45:14.500
Pretend you're paused.

45:14.500 --> 45:16.820
Fee-fi-foo-fuck.

45:16.820 --> 45:18.500
Wait, Travis.

45:18.500 --> 45:20.660
Someone make me some buffalo wings.

45:21.860 --> 45:24.260
Guys, don't be mean to Kathy Bates.

45:25.540 --> 45:27.060
She doesn't need it.

45:28.500 --> 45:29.780
She's doing her best out there.

45:29.780 --> 45:31.060
Her show just got canceled.

45:31.060 --> 45:31.940
Yeah.

45:31.940 --> 45:32.820
Oh.

45:32.820 --> 45:33.780
Oh, misery.

45:35.060 --> 45:36.260
Do you guys want a Yahoo answer?

45:36.260 --> 45:36.980
Yes, please.

45:36.980 --> 45:38.500
I would like that very much.

45:39.380 --> 45:41.060
This one was sent in by Galiayali.

45:41.060 --> 45:41.780
Thank you, Gali.

45:41.780 --> 45:44.020
It's by yahooanswersuser.

45:47.220 --> 45:49.060
It's just a bunch of Es and Ws and Gs.

45:49.060 --> 45:49.540
Who asks?

45:51.620 --> 45:53.700
When a girl wears flip-flops,

45:53.700 --> 45:56.500
why do I stare at her feet so I can get a glimpse of her soles?

46:00.500 --> 46:01.000
What?

46:01.380 --> 46:02.020
Excuse me?

46:02.020 --> 46:03.860
When a girl wears flip-flops,

46:03.860 --> 46:06.660
why do I stare at her feet so I can get a glimpse of her soles?

46:08.660 --> 46:11.860
It's almost like he answers the question in the question a little bit,

46:11.860 --> 46:14.980
but he just doesn't understand why he's able to answer it.

46:15.780 --> 46:17.940
Why is it that when a woman wears a flip-flops,

46:17.940 --> 46:19.300
I'm such a dirty foot bird?

46:19.300 --> 46:19.800
Yeah.

46:21.140 --> 46:21.640
A what?

46:21.640 --> 46:22.180
A dirty bird.

46:22.180 --> 46:23.140
A dirty foot bird.

46:23.140 --> 46:26.100
Travis is really, really on a Kathy Bates kick right now.

46:26.820 --> 46:29.300
He's doing his impression of her from the film, the hit film,

46:29.300 --> 46:32.340
He's doing his impression of her from the film, the hit film, Misery.

46:34.660 --> 46:37.140
Is Kathy Bates a dirty foot bird in Misery?

46:37.140 --> 46:38.980
Yeah, she's a real nasty.

46:38.980 --> 46:40.180
That's why she- yeah.

46:40.180 --> 46:43.620
It's- is this person just now coming to terms with the fact

46:44.180 --> 46:45.380
that he's a dirty birdie?

46:46.420 --> 46:47.140
I don't know.

46:47.140 --> 46:49.300
He's a real dirty Gus.

46:50.340 --> 46:50.900
Here's the thing.

46:51.460 --> 46:53.700
There are so many things in this world that, you know,

46:53.700 --> 46:56.820
I'm not necessarily into, but I don't judge other people for.

46:56.820 --> 46:58.340
I don't get the foot thing.

46:58.340 --> 46:58.980
I don't get the foot thing.

46:58.980 --> 46:59.620
Like at all.

47:00.180 --> 47:04.980
I mean, I mean, do you want me to show my hand right now?

47:05.940 --> 47:07.940
You want me to show my cards?

47:07.940 --> 47:08.580
Just lay them on.

47:08.580 --> 47:10.500
Yeah, I'm afraid, Griffin.

47:10.500 --> 47:12.420
Yeah, show your cards, I guess, or something.

47:12.420 --> 47:13.780
Something about a delicate arch.

47:15.140 --> 47:16.660
Uh, well, okay, let's not talk about-

47:16.660 --> 47:18.580
No, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen.

47:18.580 --> 47:20.180
No, no, shut, shut, listen, listen, listen.

47:20.180 --> 47:20.980
Okay, okay, okay.

47:21.620 --> 47:23.780
The line between heel and ball.

47:24.420 --> 47:25.540
That delicate arch.

47:25.540 --> 47:25.860
Okay.

47:25.860 --> 47:26.660
Okay.

47:26.660 --> 47:27.780
Well, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

47:27.780 --> 47:28.100
You know.

47:29.140 --> 47:29.460
Wait.

47:29.460 --> 47:30.660
What about those toesies?

47:31.300 --> 47:31.540
No.

47:31.540 --> 47:31.780
Okay.

47:32.980 --> 47:33.620
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

47:33.620 --> 47:34.340
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

47:34.340 --> 47:34.660
Wait.

47:34.660 --> 47:35.060
Oh, okay.

47:35.060 --> 47:36.740
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

47:36.740 --> 47:38.180
What about that arch?

47:38.180 --> 47:38.500
No.

47:38.500 --> 47:39.140
Okay.

47:39.140 --> 47:40.580
Well, you don't actually have a thing.

47:40.580 --> 47:42.420
What about that soft padding on there?

47:42.420 --> 47:45.380
No, you're just getting quieter and that's making it worse.

47:45.380 --> 47:47.300
It's making it much worse for me personally.

47:47.300 --> 47:48.980
All right, so the quiet, you don't-

47:48.980 --> 47:49.860
How about that arch?

47:50.500 --> 47:51.620
Nope, nope, no, no.

47:51.620 --> 47:51.860
No.

47:51.860 --> 47:52.020
Okay.

47:52.020 --> 47:52.980
No, no, no.

47:52.980 --> 47:53.220
No.

47:53.780 --> 47:55.700
Now you sound like one of the kings of comedy.

47:55.700 --> 47:59.140
And I don't appreciate that.

47:59.140 --> 48:00.820
Not on my show.

48:00.820 --> 48:04.420
Do you think this guy actually does not know why he's doing these things?

48:04.420 --> 48:06.820
Or do you think he does know and he just wants to tell the internet about it?

48:07.460 --> 48:10.500
Maybe he just feels like he's possessed by a foot demon or something.

48:10.500 --> 48:11.220
That's possible.

48:11.220 --> 48:13.460
There is that, well, that's what it is.

48:13.460 --> 48:16.500
I am Podtrax King of Feet.

48:17.060 --> 48:18.100
Podtrax King of Feet.

48:21.300 --> 48:22.980
Have you heard that new Podtrax?

48:22.980 --> 48:24.100
My brother, my brother and me.

48:24.100 --> 48:28.740
It's like a podcast, but it's got lots of feet.

48:29.940 --> 48:32.180
Is there any way we can get around this man having a fetish?

48:33.300 --> 48:35.300
Maybe he just wants to be a podiatrist.

48:35.300 --> 48:36.740
Maybe he's got a secret podiatry.

48:36.740 --> 48:38.740
No, maybe he is a podiatrist.

48:38.740 --> 48:39.780
He's just very forgetful.

48:39.780 --> 48:41.700
Maybe all podiatrists are nasty, nasty, dirty birds.

48:46.100 --> 48:49.300
I think he's got a double fetish, like a lot of these Yahoo Answers people.

48:49.300 --> 48:50.580
It's not just that he's in a feat.

48:51.300 --> 48:52.980
You can be into whatever you're into.

48:52.980 --> 48:57.700
But by definition, you keep it locked away in your heart and never tell anyone.

48:57.700 --> 49:01.700
But these people have a double fetish where they have to be into something

49:01.700 --> 49:05.060
that is outside the mainstream and they have to tell people about it.

49:05.060 --> 49:12.020
So you're saying he's in the feat and he has like his other fetishes telling people about it?

49:12.020 --> 49:12.820
Exactly.

49:12.820 --> 49:13.540
That he's in the feat.

49:13.540 --> 49:18.660
I, as somebody who works on the internet and has seen the worst that it absolutely has to offer,

49:18.660 --> 49:21.700
I'm going to go ahead and say that a foot fetish is not outside the mainstream.

49:21.700 --> 49:24.740
I'm going to say a foot fetish is actually pretty milquetoast at this point.

49:25.380 --> 49:27.860
No, but here's, okay, I can agree.

49:27.860 --> 49:30.580
If you're saying, here's the thing that makes me more uncomfortable.

49:30.580 --> 49:34.580
If your thing is cut off feet fetish, I only like feet,

49:34.580 --> 49:36.980
but what's not on the rest of the body is the only thing.

49:36.980 --> 49:38.340
I'm into half foot fetish.

49:38.340 --> 49:39.300
Yeah, right.

49:39.940 --> 49:41.220
This is what bothers me more.

49:41.220 --> 49:44.100
Do you know when you get caught checking out a girl's butt or something?

49:44.100 --> 49:44.580
No.

49:44.580 --> 49:48.580
Imagine if you got caught checking out her feet.

49:49.860 --> 49:50.820
No, because you can bite that off.

49:50.820 --> 49:52.340
You can be like, I like your shoes.

49:53.140 --> 49:54.100
You like your delicate arch.

49:54.100 --> 49:55.140
I like that delicate arch.

49:55.140 --> 49:57.700
But I think in that circumstance, everyone knows what's up.

49:57.700 --> 50:00.180
It's like, were you just peeping my toes?

50:00.180 --> 50:00.660
No.

50:00.660 --> 50:02.820
Why are you looking at girls' butts, Travis?

50:02.820 --> 50:04.500
Well, God, you're a dirty guy.

50:05.540 --> 50:06.580
Treat them like a lady.

50:06.580 --> 50:08.260
Because I'm a podiatrist.

50:11.060 --> 50:14.500
Podiatrists, of course, are notoriously nasty.

50:14.500 --> 50:18.740
Well, I was going to say I was a butterist, but that's not a thing.

50:18.740 --> 50:21.060
No, it is not, unless you work at a bakery.

50:21.060 --> 50:23.060
It's a high rising job.

50:23.060 --> 50:24.180
We have to end this show.

50:24.180 --> 50:24.660
Well, hold on.

50:24.660 --> 50:25.140
I want to hear-

50:25.140 --> 50:26.740
Wait, there's one last thing we have to do.

50:26.740 --> 50:27.300
If we have time.

50:27.300 --> 50:28.420
Do we have time?

50:28.420 --> 50:29.620
I think we have time.

50:29.620 --> 50:30.340
No, we don't.

50:30.340 --> 50:30.900
We really don't.

50:30.900 --> 50:31.540
Well, here's the thing.

50:31.540 --> 50:32.740
We don't have time.

50:32.740 --> 50:34.980
You don't, you do not, do you seriously not have time?

50:35.780 --> 50:36.420
Do we have time?

50:37.940 --> 50:38.740
We got all month.

50:38.740 --> 50:39.940
Can we make it quick?

50:39.940 --> 50:43.700
But here's the thing is that it's the first show in the month of December.

50:43.700 --> 50:48.500
And if we don't do it, then people aren't going to know that it's bingo's birthday month.

50:48.500 --> 50:50.500
Oh, what?

50:50.500 --> 50:52.980
People aren't going to know that it's operation Santa Paws.

50:53.940 --> 50:54.900
Excuse me?

50:57.860 --> 50:58.580
Do you know what I mean?

50:58.580 --> 50:59.540
Like, if we don't-

50:59.540 --> 51:02.660
Is that P-A-W-S or P-A-U-S-E?

51:02.660 --> 51:09.060
If people don't know that it's national drunk and drug driving 3D prevention month, then

51:09.060 --> 51:12.980
like, how are they going to know not to do whatever that thing means not to do to it?

51:12.980 --> 51:19.940
What is national 3D drunk and drug driving prevention?

51:19.940 --> 51:22.020
It's like the drunk guys coming right at me.

51:22.020 --> 51:22.900
Let's explore it.

51:22.900 --> 51:23.780
Let's explore this.

51:23.780 --> 51:24.100
Okay.

51:24.100 --> 51:28.180
National drunk and drugged driving 3D prevention month.

51:29.220 --> 51:30.740
You have to have some other background.

51:30.740 --> 51:33.700
Are the 3Ds drunk, drugged, and driving?

51:33.700 --> 51:34.020
Yeah.

51:34.980 --> 51:42.900
I feel like you can't, you can't say the three words that it is and then say that

51:42.900 --> 51:43.860
thing after it.

51:43.860 --> 51:47.940
Possibly, the two concepts are completely unrelated.

51:47.940 --> 51:51.220
So it's like, hey, don't go see Avatar.

51:51.220 --> 51:56.180
But if you absolutely have to, don't be drunk in the car when you go to do it.

51:57.380 --> 51:58.580
Get drunk there.

51:58.580 --> 51:59.300
Get drunk.

51:59.300 --> 52:00.900
Hey, Hugo, cut it out.

52:02.020 --> 52:03.780
This is another one that we could do.

52:03.780 --> 52:09.380
Our country is plagued with 3D movies that are also full of drunk and drug drivers.

52:09.380 --> 52:09.880
Yeah.

52:10.580 --> 52:11.700
Yeah, like Drive Angry.

52:11.700 --> 52:12.340
You see that?

52:12.340 --> 52:12.840
Yeah.

52:12.840 --> 52:17.100
Drunk King Jack Daniels the whole time, flying through the screen, reckless abandon.

52:17.100 --> 52:17.420
Man, Smurfs?

52:17.420 --> 52:18.220
Fornicating.

52:19.660 --> 52:21.340
Smurfs was family fun.

52:21.340 --> 52:23.180
I can't follow you down that.

52:23.180 --> 52:25.500
I mean, it's fun for the whole family.

52:25.500 --> 52:26.300
It was.

52:26.300 --> 52:26.940
You're right, Justin.

52:26.940 --> 52:33.020
It was like watching two whole families get hit by a truck that was driven by a drunk driver in 3D.

52:33.020 --> 52:34.700
We got to prevent it from happening.

52:34.700 --> 52:36.780
Neil Patrick Harris, what are you doing, Neil?

52:37.740 --> 52:38.460
You're better than that.

52:38.460 --> 52:40.380
Neil, better than that.

52:40.380 --> 52:44.140
I loved you in that movie about Cheech and Chong.

52:44.140 --> 52:45.180
Yeah, so good.

52:45.820 --> 52:47.340
You mean Cheech and Chong today.

52:48.860 --> 52:51.420
Cheech and Chong now.

52:51.420 --> 52:55.820
Cheech and Chong Back Up and Smoke 3D, Neil Patrick Harris.

52:56.540 --> 53:00.460
I mean, is there a warning about drunk, drug, and driving that we can dispense to people?

53:00.460 --> 53:03.020
Obviously, don't drink and drive, you goof.

53:03.020 --> 53:05.260
But like, and don't drug and drive.

53:05.260 --> 53:13.340
I, here's the thing, at this point in the course of humanity, who doesn't know not to do that?

53:13.340 --> 53:13.580
Yeah.

53:14.220 --> 53:17.580
Like, who's sitting there going, oh, that's a, that's a bad thing to do?

53:18.220 --> 53:24.940
Like, I think we're past the point of awareness now to like, just try to stamp out forgetfulness.

53:24.940 --> 53:25.580
Yeah.

53:25.580 --> 53:33.260
If someone hands you some fucking, a big dime bag of drug sauce and a fucking copy of Spy Kids 4D,

53:33.260 --> 53:35.740
you gotta slap both out of their hands, and you gotta say-

53:35.740 --> 53:37.340
What, no, Griffin, I gotta stop you there.

53:37.340 --> 53:37.900
Okay, sorry.

53:38.380 --> 53:40.220
This doesn't say anything about 4D.

53:41.980 --> 53:44.380
The fourth dimension is, the fourth dimension is smell.

53:44.940 --> 53:45.420
Yeah.

53:45.900 --> 53:51.260
Right, technically speaking, you don't want, yeah, at this point, you're just, uh, you're just

53:51.660 --> 53:55.500
piling on guilt, because people know they're not supposed to drunk, drunk drive.

53:55.500 --> 53:59.900
And you know what I don't need when I'm trying to drive drunk?

53:59.900 --> 54:00.380
What's that?

54:01.180 --> 54:02.540
Guilt to distraction.

54:02.540 --> 54:06.860
I need, I need total focus.

54:07.580 --> 54:14.140
I need complete focus, and I don't need the echo of some nagging that I got about it to be

54:14.140 --> 54:15.500
reverberating around my mind.

54:15.500 --> 54:18.300
I already feel super bad, because I'm super drunk.

54:18.300 --> 54:20.540
Yeah, yeah, I've had enough about it.

54:20.540 --> 54:21.820
In a bad place.

54:21.820 --> 54:26.060
I just think, I just think National Drunk and Drunk Driving 3D Prevention Month, I think that

54:26.060 --> 54:32.620
you, I think it's wrong to try and piggyback your own issues onto drunk driving.

54:32.620 --> 54:37.340
Like, you can't be like, it's National Drunk Driving and No Gay Marriage Prevention Month.

54:37.340 --> 54:40.140
Like, you can't, you can't, you'll be like, yeah, boo.

54:40.140 --> 54:41.900
Wait, wait, what was the other thing?

54:41.900 --> 54:43.420
Wait, what, what did you say?

54:44.300 --> 54:45.100
Did you slip in?

54:45.820 --> 54:46.380
Yeah.

54:46.380 --> 54:50.300
We are Mothers Against Drunk Driving, and gays, and gay people.

54:50.300 --> 54:50.860
Wait, hold on.

54:50.860 --> 54:52.780
Boo, don't drink and drive.

54:52.780 --> 54:57.340
Did you say Mothers, did you say Mothers Against Drunk Driving and Four Clubbing Seals?

54:59.020 --> 55:00.220
What kind of organization is that?

55:00.220 --> 55:01.820
Your acronym is whack.

55:01.820 --> 55:02.380
It's MAD.

55:03.820 --> 55:05.900
MAD Ack Cups.

55:07.420 --> 55:08.060
MAD Acks.

55:09.020 --> 55:10.940
Hey, I want to hear Griffin's last question.

55:10.940 --> 55:13.420
But first, super quick housekeeping stuff.

55:13.420 --> 55:17.580
We are doing a live performance of this very show, not this one.

55:17.580 --> 55:19.180
It won't be a stage reading of this.

55:19.180 --> 55:25.100
It'll be another episode of this on December 11th at the Blue Theater in Austin.

55:26.460 --> 55:29.900
You can get tickets, you can look at our Twitter feed for the link.

55:29.900 --> 55:34.060
You can go to mbnbam.com, and there's something there, right, Tudor?

55:34.060 --> 55:34.560
Maybe.

55:36.060 --> 55:36.620
Maybe.

55:36.620 --> 55:37.100
You just gotta-

55:37.100 --> 55:37.580
Poke around.

55:37.580 --> 55:39.580
You gotta know that the theater is behind-

55:39.580 --> 55:40.140
Yes, there is.

55:40.140 --> 55:40.780
If you go to-

55:40.780 --> 55:42.620
It's behind another building.

55:42.620 --> 55:43.660
You gotta keep an eye out for it.

55:43.660 --> 55:44.780
It's giant, and it's blue.

55:45.500 --> 55:46.300
But you gotta look.

55:46.300 --> 55:49.100
You're gonna drive into a lot, and you're gonna think, this isn't a thing you'll

55:49.100 --> 55:50.220
see a big blue building.

55:50.220 --> 55:51.020
And that's when you'll know.

55:51.740 --> 55:53.340
Just park anywhere and come inside.

55:54.300 --> 55:56.620
We sold out of our 9 o'clock show.

55:56.620 --> 56:01.260
We have less than 30 tickets left for our 7 p.m. show.

56:02.700 --> 56:05.980
And if you go to mbnbam.com, you can find the link there.

56:05.980 --> 56:09.660
We expect that, I mean, with any luck, we'll sell all those tickets

56:12.140 --> 56:13.660
before the show launches.

56:13.660 --> 56:16.780
And the 7 and 9 o'clock shows will be completely different.

56:16.780 --> 56:21.660
So if you want to come to both, we'd love to have you at both.

56:21.660 --> 56:24.380
I think everybody's gotten a chance to get tickets who wants them.

56:24.380 --> 56:27.260
So you won't be really edging anybody out.

56:27.260 --> 56:32.140
And kind of the same memo as past live shows, if you're gonna be at the show,

56:32.140 --> 56:36.700
and you'd like to have a question answered, make sure that when you email the question,

56:36.700 --> 56:41.100
let us know that you're going to be at the live show and which one you're going to be at.

56:41.100 --> 56:42.460
Whether you're gonna be at the 7 or the 9.

56:42.460 --> 56:43.100
Yeah, please do that.

56:43.100 --> 56:45.340
This is the first time we've ever tried to do two shows in one day.

56:45.340 --> 56:46.940
So we are going to need as much content.

56:46.940 --> 56:48.460
Same for Yahoo Answers too.

56:48.460 --> 56:52.380
If you can just send in like a bunch of those this week, I would be eternally grateful.

56:53.740 --> 56:59.260
And if you live in Austin and can think of a bar that we could basically occupy

57:00.220 --> 57:02.940
after both shows and like hang out for a bit, let me know.

57:02.940 --> 57:03.740
I know that there's-

57:03.740 --> 57:05.740
After the, he means after the 9 o'clock show.

57:05.740 --> 57:06.620
Yeah, so like-

57:06.620 --> 57:07.740
After both shows are over.

57:07.740 --> 57:09.100
Yeah, like 1030 or something like that.

57:09.980 --> 57:13.100
And 7 o'clock people will expect you to come back out and hang out.

57:13.100 --> 57:17.020
Yeah, so just sit outside the theater and wait for us for a while.

57:17.020 --> 57:18.380
We'll pick up a ticket for the 9 o'clock.

57:18.380 --> 57:19.100
Yep.

57:19.100 --> 57:20.140
They're going to be completely different.

57:21.020 --> 57:22.300
Some of us are going to be the same.

57:22.300 --> 57:24.620
And if we could fucking manage that, that would be amazing.

57:24.620 --> 57:26.620
Your second show will be the first show, but backwards.

57:27.900 --> 57:32.060
We'll just have to cut out all of our references to the time that we wrote into the first show.

57:33.180 --> 57:35.260
Also, we're going to have our posters with us.

57:35.980 --> 57:39.500
So make sure you bring some cash money if you'd like to pick up one of those.

57:39.500 --> 57:39.980
They're going to be-

57:39.980 --> 57:41.580
Well, what, at 10?

57:41.580 --> 57:41.980
Yep.

57:41.980 --> 57:42.780
10 bucks?

57:42.780 --> 57:43.980
Yeah, bring 10 bucks with you.

57:43.980 --> 57:44.540
Get it-

57:44.540 --> 57:46.940
Make sure you get it signed if you are interested in that sort of thing.

57:46.940 --> 57:49.100
And also, I shaved my mustache.

57:49.100 --> 57:52.140
I know I said I was going to keep it for the live show, but it was too gross.

57:52.780 --> 57:53.900
I have a giant beard.

57:53.900 --> 57:54.220
Travis is-

57:54.220 --> 57:54.940
The biggest beard.

57:54.940 --> 57:56.460
Travis is going to go full Grizzly Adams.

57:56.460 --> 57:59.820
I'm looking at a fucking Joseph Gordon-Levitt situation over here.

58:00.380 --> 58:01.420
Smooth, smooth face.

58:02.620 --> 58:07.660
As always, thank you to John Roderick of the Long Winters for both his question this week

58:07.660 --> 58:10.300
and for letting us use his music.

58:10.300 --> 58:17.660
And thank you for people talking about our show on Twitter using the MBMBAM hashtag.

58:18.540 --> 58:19.500
I should play me.

58:20.220 --> 58:22.060
Babylonian doing a lot there.

58:24.540 --> 58:30.940
Our dear friend Ash Nobasu from New Zealand was wondering if we would be returning this week.

58:30.940 --> 58:35.820
DMZilla, as always, complimenting our good friend Bob Ball.

58:35.820 --> 58:40.540
Nerdishow, we helped to make their 16-hour drive survivable this week.

58:40.540 --> 58:41.340
Viva La Betty.

58:41.340 --> 58:41.900
Everybody.

58:42.620 --> 58:43.020
We really appreciate it.

58:43.020 --> 58:43.740
Thanks, everybody.

58:44.780 --> 58:47.020
