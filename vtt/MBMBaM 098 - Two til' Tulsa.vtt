WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.360 --> 00:16.000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:16.000 --> 00:31.200
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:31.200 --> 00:40.960
It's a new craze, and good girls do you wanna just say hey I wanna, just say hey I wanna.

00:45.760 --> 00:55.760
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, welcome to Kayfabulous, your source for wrestling news.

00:55.760 --> 01:04.000
What is the name of our radio station? Kayfabulous. I do not.

01:05.040 --> 01:10.400
As you know, in pro wrestling, Kayfabe is the portrayal of events within the industry as real

01:10.400 --> 01:17.600
or true. It represents a suspension of disbelief required to watch wrestling. So Kayfabulous is

01:17.600 --> 01:24.160
the name of our wrestling show that we're doing. If you have to look at Urban Dictionary to decipher

01:24.160 --> 01:30.240
a goof, then. Like I don't, but like if you're in the world, this is a show for true fans. I am,

01:31.440 --> 01:38.480
ever since I am watching Wrestlemania tonight, I have been really into the world, the mythos,

01:38.480 --> 01:46.960
if you will, of Wrestlemania, or as I like to call it, the big slam. And Kayfabulous is a new

01:46.960 --> 01:50.960
direction for my brother, my brother and me in Advice Show for the Modern Era, that represents

01:50.960 --> 01:55.600
that new direction, that bold new direction that I'm taking our show in. This is not an April fool.

01:55.600 --> 02:00.480
So basically what you're saying is we've, we've picked a fake sport for fake sport people.

02:01.200 --> 02:07.520
What? Who's your favorite slam man right now? People who are working right now. I mean,

02:07.520 --> 02:14.480
all time, obviously, uh, Brett, the Hitman Hart, uh, right now. Is he the one who fell and died?

02:14.480 --> 02:20.000
No, no, no. That's his brother, his dear departed brother, Owen. Uh, right now I'm really into

02:20.000 --> 02:26.000
Fancy Dan, the turnbuckle man, who is sort of a, he's kind of a, um, he's kind of like that berries

02:26.000 --> 02:30.400
and cream guy from the Starburst commercials, except his leg muscles are just palpating,

02:30.400 --> 02:34.800
you know, he's like, he uses them to kick. I understand. Yeah. He'll kick anything that

02:36.080 --> 02:40.400
they don't let baby snare him anymore. Cause he will just kick. He, it's like blind,

02:40.400 --> 02:45.600
it's like blind instinct in there. It's like working with a Puma. Uh, I miss, uh, you know,

02:45.600 --> 02:52.240
I miss, I miss, uh, I miss Jimmy Jean shorts. He was the rest. He was the rest. He was the slam man

02:52.240 --> 02:59.120
who would, uh, he would wear like sweat pants into the ring and just get the ever loving shit

03:00.000 --> 03:06.560
just beaten out of him or kicked out of him. Um, and then when in his hour of need,

03:06.560 --> 03:12.240
he would rip his sweat pants off and there'd be some jorts on under it. And then he would,

03:12.240 --> 03:18.560
he would find his strength inside of himself via using the, the gene shorts as some sort of focus.

03:19.120 --> 03:24.880
I, uh, I do know who I miss who's that? Travis, the karate kid. Yeah. He was very good. He was

03:24.880 --> 03:29.360
really weird. He had a weird thing about him. I do want to introduce ourselves, uh, before we get

03:29.360 --> 03:36.800
too deep into fabulous. I am your oldest brother, Justin, the reconciler McElroy. And I'm your

03:36.800 --> 03:44.960
middle is brother hacks all Travis McElroy. And I am your baby brother, uh, Griffin, Daisy Dukes,

03:45.760 --> 03:54.400
McElroy. I was Jimmy Jean shorts. Uh, second. I was his, his foil. That's what they use. That's

03:54.400 --> 04:00.000
what they call it. Sort of like Paul bearer was the foil of the undertaker. I am the one part of

04:00.000 --> 04:04.480
this goof in this advice show for the modern era that we do every week. The one part of this, this

04:04.480 --> 04:09.280
is not goof. I am indeed watching WrestleMania this evening and I have been attempting to

04:09.280 --> 04:14.640
educate myself, to catch myself up on some of the various storylines and plot lines that will be

04:14.640 --> 04:22.320
represented this evening. Um, I rec I, uh, I, I hear the rock is coming back to fight our friend,

04:22.320 --> 04:27.520
our, our dear friend, John Cena. That will be the athletic contest. He is the, the reigning champion

04:27.520 --> 04:33.360
from last year's WrestleMania, even though he was the fucking referee. Right. WrestleMania,

04:33.360 --> 04:40.480
you are the craziest. You are so crazy. Speaking of crazy, what I was really shocked by is that

04:40.480 --> 04:50.240
there are men in this athletic contest that were adult men wrestling when I was a baby, a baby boy.

04:50.240 --> 04:55.840
And now I'm a grown man. I've grown into my body. You know, I have my own muscles and my own take

04:55.840 --> 05:04.240
down moves, but these guys are still out there doing their thing. They're still out there. The

05:04.240 --> 05:09.680
undertaker is literally 78 years old now, right? How hard must it be to retire from this sport and

05:09.680 --> 05:17.360
do something else? Well, like what do you do after this? Well, you become an undertaker. I mean,

05:18.400 --> 05:24.240
your business, your business, you will not be able to control how, how much work you get there,

05:24.240 --> 05:30.640
but he, I mean, so he's four, the undertaker's 47 years old. He's basically, I saw him in last

05:30.640 --> 05:36.720
year's WrestleMania. He looked 96. You could stack two dads on top of each other. And depending on

05:36.720 --> 05:42.640
the dad, they still might not be as old as the undertaker. He's the oldest person basically in

05:42.640 --> 05:48.000
the world. And he is out there tonight at the wrestling event that I'm going to be a very big

05:48.000 --> 05:57.040
fan of. He is out there tonight, just dealing out, you know, the classic Texas red style justice that

05:57.040 --> 06:01.760
he's known for. He's, he's going to be dishing it out and then driving his kids to school.

06:01.760 --> 06:05.840
Yeah, I don't want him to, I don't want him to, I don't want him to hear me because he could

06:05.840 --> 06:12.480
probably just obliterate me. He could just erase me from existence with one slam, but I watched him

06:12.480 --> 06:18.640
last year and his, his, his skin looked so brittle wrapped around his muscles. It looked like at

06:18.640 --> 06:24.400
any time, like if he gets slammed the wrong way, that his skin would just like pop and his insides

06:24.400 --> 06:28.640
would just, he would just spill out. I would just spill out onto the canvas. That would be,

06:29.360 --> 06:33.440
I mean, that's the ultimate power move. If you're talking about intimidation,

06:33.440 --> 06:37.280
if you, if your opponent goes into a match knowing that with the wrong slam,

06:37.280 --> 06:42.400
You could burst. They could split you wide open like a balloon full of spaghettios.

06:42.400 --> 06:44.880
That's a horrifying image to try to put on somebody.

06:45.920 --> 06:49.440
That's why Jimmy Jean Schwartz isn't allowed to play anymore.

06:49.440 --> 06:49.840
Oh yeah?

06:49.840 --> 06:53.200
He burst, he burst open Rey Mysterio. That's why he has to wear that mask.

06:54.240 --> 06:58.800
Poor Rey Mysterio. He's, he is inspired by luchadors.

06:58.800 --> 07:01.920
CM Punk saw the event, got so scared he went straight edge.

07:01.920 --> 07:04.240
These are all wrestling goofs. How do I know all this shit?

07:04.240 --> 07:06.240
I don't know. How do you know this shit?

07:06.240 --> 07:10.880
It's terrifying. You have these deep pools of knowledge within yourself. Like the only thing,

07:10.880 --> 07:14.480
I know some assorted, like I knew I was going to bust out one of the,

07:14.480 --> 07:19.520
I know one of the undertaker's moves is the, I'm so sorry for your loss. That's one.

07:20.320 --> 07:21.920
That's a smelling salts.

07:21.920 --> 07:26.400
He's known for the, he's known for his pile driver and I know that and I don't know how I know that.

07:26.400 --> 07:29.840
It's called the, the tombstone, isn't it?

07:29.840 --> 07:33.280
Tomb, tomb, tomb raider. It's called the tomb raider.

07:33.280 --> 07:33.840
That's right.

07:33.840 --> 07:37.200
It's the name of that, it's the name of that move.

07:37.200 --> 07:41.600
So, so this has been K Fabulous, our podcast within a podcast about wrestling.

07:41.600 --> 07:46.480
We sure hope you enjoyed it, but now I think we should try our hands at some advice.

07:47.840 --> 07:50.000
I have quite a large friend group and we all get along,

07:50.000 --> 07:54.880
but there's one girl who's part of them who lately has just been so annoying.

07:54.880 --> 07:58.880
We try to be nice and try to be patient, but sometimes she could be too annoying.

07:58.880 --> 08:04.000
Is there any way I can get her to leave us or at least me alone without being rude or

08:04.000 --> 08:06.480
hurting her feelings? That's from annoyed in Kansas city.

08:08.320 --> 08:14.240
What I mean, I understand this is like a huge problem in pretty much every friend group.

08:14.240 --> 08:19.040
You have that one friend that every time he or she comes around, they just ruin your pizza.

08:19.040 --> 08:19.520
Right.

08:21.040 --> 08:23.520
Ruin the special blend of friendship toppings that you've made.

08:23.520 --> 08:28.240
No, it's the freshness. They just, they, they lose the freshness of the pizza.

08:28.240 --> 08:29.440
Mm hmm.

08:29.440 --> 08:32.880
And you want to, uh, these are, these are annoyed goofs.

08:32.880 --> 08:34.160
Okay. Oh, wow.

08:34.800 --> 08:35.280
Wow.

08:35.280 --> 08:35.600
Wow.

08:36.800 --> 08:39.200
My friend is annoyed and like that.

08:39.840 --> 08:43.680
Are you, are you kidding me?

08:43.680 --> 08:50.400
Welcome to the Smothers Brothers comedy hour with Griffin McElroy, Rowan and Martin shit show.

08:50.400 --> 08:53.040
Guys, the annoyed, the annoyed is back.

08:53.040 --> 08:54.160
Is he back?

08:54.160 --> 08:55.040
Better than ever.

08:55.040 --> 08:57.520
Uh, and more relevant than ever.

08:57.520 --> 09:03.600
Apparently you could tell what great momentum he has cause Griffin has to explain the goof to us.

09:03.600 --> 09:07.200
You can tell what a great, great debt he's making in them.

09:07.200 --> 09:12.000
Who hears about the compromising of pizza freshness and doesn't instantly think of the

09:12.000 --> 09:14.480
annoyed. The two are synonymous.

09:14.480 --> 09:20.560
I mean, basically you were right. Um, I, the problem with this,

09:20.560 --> 09:22.960
here's the problem with getting rid of the annoying friend.

09:22.960 --> 09:27.040
You got an annoying friend in your group, happens the best of us.

09:27.040 --> 09:30.880
If you get rid of that annoying friend, someone else becomes the most annoying

09:30.880 --> 09:33.200
friend in your group and friendo that might be you.

09:33.920 --> 09:34.080
Yeah.

09:34.080 --> 09:37.840
You need to take, you need, before you extricate this person,

09:37.840 --> 09:42.880
you need to make sure that you are not going to be the new sort of object of ire, you know?

09:43.440 --> 09:45.680
Is it sort of like the, like a reverse Highlander?

09:46.720 --> 09:48.960
Uh, yes, yes.

09:49.840 --> 09:50.880
There has to be one.

09:50.880 --> 09:56.880
There has to be one. Um, sometimes there's two, but it has to be at least one.

09:57.440 --> 10:00.720
And you need to make sure that you're not sort of next in the line of succession.

10:01.680 --> 10:05.920
Look around you, make sure there's someone more annoying than you, but less annoying than her.

10:06.640 --> 10:07.440
You're golden.

10:07.440 --> 10:08.960
Then you're set to move on.

10:08.960 --> 10:14.400
You guys are turning this into a punishment when in reality it could be a teacher toonity.

10:14.960 --> 10:19.040
Oh, I think you could show this person the error of their ways.

10:19.040 --> 10:21.360
And I think you could do it in a classy way.

10:21.360 --> 10:24.080
Like a night, like a Christmas carol kind of way?

10:24.640 --> 10:25.200
Yeah.

10:25.200 --> 10:26.400
Well, I don't know.

10:26.400 --> 10:27.760
There will be three ghosts.

10:27.760 --> 10:28.400
No, there doesn't.

10:29.360 --> 10:29.520
No.

10:29.520 --> 10:30.320
Would there be ghosts?

10:30.320 --> 10:30.640
No.

10:30.640 --> 10:32.720
The lesson won't be, it won't be spectral in nature.

10:32.720 --> 10:34.880
This sounds like a one ghost problem to me.

10:34.880 --> 10:35.680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:35.680 --> 10:36.560
Maybe one and a half.

10:37.200 --> 10:41.280
So what you can do, it'd be like, hey, um, you, just to let you know,

10:41.280 --> 10:44.960
like when you talk during movies, like it, it, it's irksome.

10:45.760 --> 10:48.480
Um, this is a teacher toonity.

10:48.480 --> 10:49.520
I'm helping you.

10:49.520 --> 10:52.880
You got to make sure to say like, I am helping you and make sure that they know that you're

10:52.880 --> 10:54.400
not just like slapping them on the wrist.

10:54.400 --> 10:58.640
That they, you know, though, Griff, I think that that only works if the person already

10:58.640 --> 11:00.800
kind of has an inkling that they might be annoying.

11:01.440 --> 11:02.480
Oh, they know.

11:02.480 --> 11:02.960
They know.

11:03.520 --> 11:04.320
How do they not?

11:04.320 --> 11:06.160
Their own parents don't like to hang around them.

11:07.360 --> 11:13.440
You need to, you need to tell this person, listen, you are in real dire straits here.

11:13.440 --> 11:13.760
Yeah.

11:13.760 --> 11:15.840
You're in peril of being extricated.

11:15.840 --> 11:18.960
I'm going to reshape you like in the legend of bagger Vance.

11:18.960 --> 11:21.920
I'm going to train you in how to be a better person.

11:21.920 --> 11:23.280
This is me helping you.

11:23.280 --> 11:27.920
You are, you constantly talk down any plans that we may come up with.

11:27.920 --> 11:30.160
And it's just kind of, it kind of brings down the group when you do that.

11:30.160 --> 11:36.080
So if you be more of a yes, man, instead of a no, sir, then, uh, then I'm helping you.

11:36.080 --> 11:37.600
This is a teacher toonity.

11:37.600 --> 11:38.560
Get off my pizza.

11:38.560 --> 11:41.600
And as long as you have a clipboard, that's totally cool.

11:41.600 --> 11:42.400
Everything's great.

11:42.400 --> 11:46.320
You can either start being a yes, man, or a, Hey, where are you guys, man?

11:47.680 --> 11:49.840
That's why isn't anyone answering the phone, man.

11:49.840 --> 11:50.080
Yeah.

11:50.080 --> 11:51.040
You don't want to be that man.

11:52.080 --> 11:56.160
So, uh, I think if you're, it depends on how much energy.

11:56.160 --> 11:58.800
Sometimes you don't have the energy for that, especially as you get older.

11:59.360 --> 12:02.560
Um, you just, you just kind of stop calling people.

12:02.560 --> 12:03.040
Yeah.

12:03.040 --> 12:04.720
That's pretty much it.

12:04.720 --> 12:08.880
Uh, you, you just sort of let them ease on ease on down the road.

12:08.880 --> 12:12.240
Well, that's another, oh, that's another great lesson to take away from this

12:12.240 --> 12:16.080
Justin, if this person is like, if you're in school and have a bunch of classes

12:16.080 --> 12:20.000
with this person and they are, no matter what you do going to be in the same

12:20.000 --> 12:25.600
place as you on many occasions into the future, don't pull the trigger on this.

12:25.600 --> 12:25.840
Yep.

12:26.400 --> 12:30.640
Because they're still going to be there awkwardly over in the corner.

12:31.840 --> 12:32.240
Yeah.

12:32.240 --> 12:32.560
Right.

12:33.760 --> 12:37.680
So if you can escape them, don't pull the trigger on this.

12:37.680 --> 12:38.880
Don't pull the trigger.

12:38.880 --> 12:39.280
You know what?

12:39.280 --> 12:40.720
You should pull the trigger on though.

12:40.720 --> 12:44.640
If are you a maximum fun fan or would you say you're a fanatic?

12:45.360 --> 12:50.080
Do you listen to my brother, my brother, me and judge John Hodgeman and Jade and

12:50.080 --> 12:53.920
Jordan, Jesse go and stop podcasting yourself and international waters and the

12:53.920 --> 12:54.720
new hit throwing shade.

12:54.720 --> 12:55.440
Do you listen to all those?

12:55.440 --> 12:57.520
You think, God, I love this.

12:57.520 --> 13:05.120
I'm really enjoying this, but how can I return the generosity, the audio

13:05.120 --> 13:08.240
generosity of a show me, you have that opportunity right now.

13:08.240 --> 13:14.880
It's a, we're in the second half entering the back stretch of the maximum fun drive.

13:14.880 --> 13:21.680
You have one week left to get in on this and show your support for your maximum fun family.

13:21.680 --> 13:22.960
I get, can I say family?

13:22.960 --> 13:23.440
Is that?

13:23.440 --> 13:25.360
Yeah, I think family is fair.

13:25.360 --> 13:28.800
I think of every single one of our listeners as a, I don't know, a first cousin.

13:29.360 --> 13:29.840
Yeah.

13:30.480 --> 13:34.880
Here's the, the, let me give you guys the, the, the short, the short version of the pitch.

13:34.880 --> 13:37.680
You go to maximum fun.org forward slash donors.

13:37.680 --> 13:38.320
Slash donate.

13:39.280 --> 13:44.000
There are several donation levels starting at $5 a month, all the way up to $200

13:44.960 --> 13:45.520
per month.

13:45.520 --> 13:49.520
If you want to be one of Jordan's platinum angels, I want to tell you what happens.

13:49.520 --> 13:55.040
If you give us, if you can find it in your heart to part with $20 a month, you can say,

13:55.040 --> 13:58.000
Hey, I need, I love these shows.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.200
I love the brothers.

13:59.200 --> 14:02.080
I love Jordan, Jessica, go less than them.

14:03.120 --> 14:04.480
I want to give you $20 a month.

14:04.480 --> 14:05.200
You're going to join.

14:05.200 --> 14:06.960
Why does it why less?

14:06.960 --> 14:08.960
They love them less than us.

14:08.960 --> 14:09.920
They love us more.

14:09.920 --> 14:10.880
That's key.

14:10.880 --> 14:12.320
We're going to come back to that in a second.

14:12.880 --> 14:13.120
Okay.

14:13.120 --> 14:14.560
So you want to give $20 a month.

14:14.560 --> 14:16.640
You're going to join the diamond friendship circle.

14:16.640 --> 14:23.680
You'll receive a shiny new stainless steel water bottle in a handy on the go size.

14:23.680 --> 14:28.160
It's going to be screen printed with the cool maximum fun rocket ship logo.

14:28.160 --> 14:33.440
You're also going to get a beautiful max fun friendship bracelet that is going to look

14:33.440 --> 14:38.800
so fresh and will guarantee you the biggest of hugs when you meet us in person, which

14:38.800 --> 14:40.400
you secretly know you will someday.

14:40.400 --> 14:42.320
You don't want to be not wearing the bracelet because we'll know

14:42.880 --> 14:43.280
last year.

14:43.280 --> 14:44.640
It was a last year.

14:44.640 --> 14:48.160
It was the maximum fund membership cards and no kidding.

14:48.160 --> 14:52.240
Anytime we went to an event, we would see people who bust those out and give them just

14:52.240 --> 14:56.640
the dankest headiest hugs that they have ever received.

14:56.640 --> 14:57.520
Marley hugs.

14:58.960 --> 15:00.560
You don't want to miss out on that treatment.

15:00.560 --> 15:00.800
Yeah.

15:00.800 --> 15:01.920
You don't want to miss out on that.

15:01.920 --> 15:08.240
And you're also going to get and this I think is the greatest gift of all, but you were

15:08.240 --> 15:11.120
going to get a ton of digital content.

15:11.120 --> 15:12.400
You're going to get a bonus.

15:13.680 --> 15:18.080
My brother, my brother, me episode starring our dad with us.

15:18.080 --> 15:23.680
You're going to get a 15 minute video of us performing in Austin for Austin live show.

15:23.680 --> 15:31.040
You're also going to get a rift video that's us watching an old timey educational film

15:31.040 --> 15:33.120
about alcohol and goofing on it.

15:33.920 --> 15:35.040
And that's just from us.

15:35.600 --> 15:39.440
Everybody's got a bunch of bonus episodes and videos like that.

15:39.440 --> 15:43.200
So you're going to get access to a ton of that stuff.

15:43.200 --> 15:46.320
And you get that at every level, every five dollars a month.

15:46.320 --> 15:49.840
You can get all that stuff and it will just mean the world to us.

15:49.840 --> 15:51.760
Now, here's the important thing right now.

15:52.640 --> 15:55.360
My brother, my brother, me is getting I don't want to turn it into a competition, but it

15:55.360 --> 15:57.280
is we're getting beat by Jordan.

15:57.280 --> 16:02.720
Just go, you choose your favorite show when you pledge and more people are choosing them

16:02.720 --> 16:03.120
than us.

16:03.120 --> 16:07.120
We're tied with bullseye and that's on the radio.

16:07.120 --> 16:09.440
So they don't need they don't need you like we need you.

16:09.440 --> 16:11.280
They're getting them radio dollars.

16:11.840 --> 16:13.920
Yeah, they're getting radio money.

16:13.920 --> 16:15.280
We need your real money.

16:15.280 --> 16:19.680
We need you to rise up and say, my favorite show is my brother, my brother and me.

16:19.680 --> 16:23.680
And I love all the shows, but I love them best.

16:23.680 --> 16:24.480
Think of it this way.

16:24.480 --> 16:30.000
It's both your opportunity to contribute to maximum fun as a whole and also your opportunity

16:30.000 --> 16:32.880
to really let everyone know that we're way better than them.

16:32.880 --> 16:33.200
Yeah.

16:33.200 --> 16:35.760
You really got to help us stick it to the man.

16:35.760 --> 16:37.120
And by the man, we mean everybody.

16:37.120 --> 16:39.200
It's not us because we're paranoid.

16:40.320 --> 16:42.880
But anyway, maximum fun dot org slash donate.

16:42.880 --> 16:43.840
Go there right now.

16:44.480 --> 16:45.200
Rise up.

16:45.200 --> 16:46.880
My bim bambinos crushed the J.

16:46.880 --> 16:47.040
J.

16:47.040 --> 16:54.320
Go army underneath your hand like so many shoddily construct constructed action figures.

16:54.320 --> 16:59.680
And then after you do that, go on Twitter and tell everyone that you voted for us above

16:59.680 --> 17:00.240
everyone else.

17:00.240 --> 17:01.440
Sorry, fools.

17:01.440 --> 17:02.640
Sorry, haters.

17:02.640 --> 17:07.760
And make sure to use the hashtag max fun drive so they know that in the NBA rules.

17:08.560 --> 17:10.080
Why would they know that from that?

17:11.360 --> 17:15.600
I guess you got to use both the NBA hashtag and the max fun drive.

17:15.600 --> 17:18.800
And there are no there are no characters left for tweeting.

17:18.800 --> 17:20.960
And a picture of yourself flipping the double bird.

17:21.920 --> 17:23.280
This is for Jordan and Jesse.

17:23.280 --> 17:25.200
I got one for each of you in your ear.

17:27.360 --> 17:28.560
So do that.

17:28.560 --> 17:30.240
That seems like pretty extreme.

17:30.240 --> 17:37.680
But if they're putting their middle fingers like corn holders, here's the tweet.

17:37.680 --> 17:39.120
You're talking about your donation.

17:39.120 --> 17:42.320
You've got max fun drive and B&B and hashtags in there.

17:42.320 --> 17:47.360
You've got a link to maximum fun dot org slash donate.

17:47.360 --> 17:50.400
And you've got to bet you're at one hundred and ninety characters right now.

17:50.400 --> 17:53.600
You've also got a picture of yourself flipping the double bird.

17:53.600 --> 17:55.280
One for Jordan and one for Jesse.

17:55.280 --> 17:58.160
And a gif of someone with a sour face is going mmm.

17:58.160 --> 17:59.680
No, we don't have room for that tweet.

18:01.280 --> 18:04.240
You link that on twit pic, you're at around 300 characters.

18:04.240 --> 18:07.840
Just send that to us and we'll retweet it because I really want to see at least one

18:07.840 --> 18:08.560
person do that.

18:08.560 --> 18:10.080
Come on, Griffin.

18:10.080 --> 18:10.480
You know what I mean.

18:10.480 --> 18:12.320
Here's a Yahoo answer for us to consider.

18:14.880 --> 18:17.200
It was sent in by Atiana Kuriyama.

18:17.200 --> 18:17.920
Thank you, Atiana.

18:17.920 --> 18:23.760
It's by Yahoo Answers user Kyle, who asks, I'm a country boy and I want to tattoo.

18:25.440 --> 18:28.960
I think it's supposed to be tattoo, but when it's only got the one L.

18:28.960 --> 18:30.000
I want Audrey tattoo.

18:30.640 --> 18:35.440
A tattoo is when you get a tattoo because you've plateaued in your life.

18:35.440 --> 18:35.680
Sure.

18:37.360 --> 18:38.400
I've tattooed.

18:38.400 --> 18:40.160
It's not a tattoo on your toe.

18:40.160 --> 18:42.720
Travis is going to go for the fucking metagoof.

18:42.720 --> 18:47.520
I want something that says, hey, I'm a country boy and proud of it.

18:47.520 --> 18:54.880
Don't know which words to use though, something short and sweet, a one-liner or even better,

18:54.880 --> 18:55.680
a few words.

18:55.680 --> 18:57.280
Thanks for the help.

18:57.760 --> 19:04.000
He spelled four F-E-R to really drive the point home that he is he is rural.

19:05.520 --> 19:09.920
Basically anything that Hank Williams Jr.

19:09.920 --> 19:20.800
has ever said, ever escaped his lips, or escaped his mustache more trickily, would be a great

19:20.800 --> 19:21.600
option here.

19:23.680 --> 19:26.880
I suppose anything from the Blue Collar Comedy Tour.

19:27.600 --> 19:28.640
Any of their jokes.

19:29.680 --> 19:30.960
Get her done.

19:32.160 --> 19:34.720
No, I think it's get them done.

19:34.720 --> 19:36.160
Just do it.

19:36.160 --> 19:37.200
Get them done.

19:37.200 --> 19:40.560
Just do it, get them done already.

19:42.720 --> 19:45.280
Maybe like trucking and fucking.

19:47.280 --> 19:49.360
No, no way.

19:50.240 --> 19:51.040
No way.

19:51.680 --> 19:57.840
Maybe something patriotic like the dig them frog standing in front of an American flag,

19:57.840 --> 20:02.240
but also on top of a French flag while crushing a French Tweety Bird.

20:02.240 --> 20:03.920
Dip one from a peephole.

20:03.920 --> 20:10.640
Dip one like he's doing chaw, but he's doing it in honor of his people.

20:10.640 --> 20:12.960
What says I'm a country?

20:12.960 --> 20:15.520
What is the message you want to get out there?

20:17.120 --> 20:19.360
I'm a country boy and I'm proud of it.

20:20.800 --> 20:28.560
Maybe that, I mean, that seems very sort of to the structurally from a grammar perspective.

20:28.560 --> 20:31.600
Yeah, done like in a nice like calligraphy kind of style.

20:32.320 --> 20:32.880
Yeah.

20:32.880 --> 20:34.560
What about just in calligraphy?

20:34.560 --> 20:36.960
Just the word agriculture on your body.

20:37.680 --> 20:38.400
Would that be good?

20:40.000 --> 20:43.200
I feel like that says a lot about like I my farmer.

20:43.200 --> 20:48.800
My parents were farmers or ranchers, but they were involved with the production of

20:49.760 --> 20:53.360
well produce that you get and eat at your grocery store.

20:53.360 --> 20:57.200
Maybe it's like a picture of a farm, but they're growing pickup trucks.

20:58.480 --> 21:00.640
Is that an image we can capture in tattoo?

21:00.640 --> 21:04.000
And an American eagle is harvesting them.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.200
I love this.

21:05.200 --> 21:07.440
Is the eagle driving like a caterpillar?

21:08.080 --> 21:10.800
Like a caterpillar, I'm sorry, a caterpillar like truck.

21:10.800 --> 21:11.520
Oh, yes.

21:11.520 --> 21:13.840
Yes, he is doing it by himself.

21:13.840 --> 21:17.840
And there are a bunch of migrants watching from afar and like,

21:17.840 --> 21:21.600
migrants are watching the eagle driving the caterpillar truck,

21:21.600 --> 21:24.160
harvesting smaller ears of trucks.

21:24.160 --> 21:26.720
The eagle has a tattoo that says trucking and fucking.

21:26.720 --> 21:32.400
Right, and the eagle saying something like, sorry, Paco, I've got it under control.

21:32.400 --> 21:36.560
Or something like sort of racist, but it's not like in your face.

21:36.560 --> 21:39.040
You wouldn't be ashamed to take it off with the Olympic pool, you know?

21:39.040 --> 21:40.960
That's 110% racist.

21:41.760 --> 21:43.360
Is it because he said Paco?

21:43.360 --> 21:46.880
Yeah, that was a contributing factor, Travis.

21:48.480 --> 21:53.760
Can you get Calvin from Calvin and Hobbes and he's maybe like peeing on a city skyline?

21:54.320 --> 21:56.240
I was going to say I'm a city skyline.

21:56.240 --> 21:57.840
Why not a city skyline?

21:57.840 --> 21:59.520
Because it's like, fuck the city.

21:59.520 --> 21:59.760
Yeah.

21:59.760 --> 22:01.040
Oh, right, okay.

22:01.040 --> 22:03.040
He doesn't care for urban environments.

22:03.040 --> 22:05.920
You get the American eagle eating a city mouse.

22:07.520 --> 22:08.880
That might be a little hard to convey.

22:08.880 --> 22:12.400
Or a giant American eagle eating a city.

22:13.360 --> 22:17.600
What about a giant American eagle eating an American eagle retail store?

22:17.600 --> 22:21.120
Because it says, oh, hey, I know, I know.

22:21.760 --> 22:24.640
Why are the eagles so big?

22:24.640 --> 22:29.280
Why can't it be just like a tasteful eagle eating a tasteful yet smaller American eagle store?

22:29.280 --> 22:32.800
When you say giant, do you mean like in scale or like on his back?

22:32.800 --> 22:39.680
I'm imagining a large ambulatory a la foghorn leghorn,

22:39.680 --> 22:43.840
like walking around like super beefy eagle man hybrid.

22:44.560 --> 22:45.920
Oops, I'm turned on.

22:45.920 --> 22:46.400
Oh, no.

22:46.400 --> 22:47.520
Oh, no.

22:48.560 --> 22:49.280
Not a kill.

22:49.280 --> 22:50.560
Get through what episode?

22:52.000 --> 22:54.320
Do you guys know the tattoo that Tony Danza has?

22:54.320 --> 22:55.040
What is it?

22:55.040 --> 23:02.320
It is a picture on his bicep of a man walking and around the man it says keep on trucking.

23:03.280 --> 23:07.520
I recall this from like, I think I saw it 15 years ago and God, I hope that's correct.

23:07.520 --> 23:10.400
But I'm fairly sure that is a tattoo that Tony Danza sports.

23:10.400 --> 23:14.800
He is two words away from trucking and fucking.

23:16.400 --> 23:22.320
With the slightest amount of modification, we could get him on the rural train.

23:22.320 --> 23:25.520
Or I guess the rural pack mule.

23:25.520 --> 23:26.080
What is it?

23:26.080 --> 23:27.120
What's the train out there?

23:28.400 --> 23:29.280
I guess it's just a train.

23:29.280 --> 23:30.640
Who rides a train anymore?

23:30.640 --> 23:30.880
Right.

23:32.480 --> 23:35.920
Old timey farmers that don't know shit about planes and things.

23:35.920 --> 23:36.560
They get scared.

23:36.560 --> 23:37.840
They think it's a white dragon.

23:39.840 --> 23:41.360
They don't think that farmers, I'm sorry.

23:43.360 --> 23:44.480
No, this is a good.

23:44.480 --> 23:47.840
This is let's explore this vein because you could just get an Amish person

23:48.400 --> 23:50.720
because the Amish are like the ultimate country boys.

23:50.720 --> 23:52.480
Oh, the oldest school.

23:52.480 --> 23:53.680
Old school.

23:54.560 --> 23:54.960
Oh, what?

23:54.960 --> 23:57.440
You're listening to Hank Williams on the radio?

23:57.440 --> 23:59.760
We don't know who that is or what that is.

24:00.720 --> 24:01.920
We don't have zippers.

24:02.560 --> 24:05.440
So maybe we're more street than you think.

24:06.720 --> 24:11.520
When the black swan comes and revolution sleeps across this globe and technology shuts down

24:11.520 --> 24:15.760
around us, the Amish are going to be the only ones that are out there just like living.

24:16.800 --> 24:18.080
That are making it.

24:18.080 --> 24:20.640
It just just real quick.

24:20.640 --> 24:20.880
Okay.

24:22.800 --> 24:23.920
What is the black swan?

24:23.920 --> 24:25.680
And why is it the harbinger of the apocalypse?

24:26.560 --> 24:28.000
I thought you meant that movie.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.120
Yeah, I thought that too.

24:29.120 --> 24:31.840
No, when when that movie comes to Amish villages.

24:32.400 --> 24:36.640
Well, I mean, if that was the only movie they'd ever seen, it would kind of jack them up.

24:37.600 --> 24:37.760
Sure.

24:38.640 --> 24:41.040
That would be I mean, that would be that would be pretty messed up.

24:41.040 --> 24:47.200
But a black swan is a is a disproportionate role.

24:47.200 --> 24:52.480
I'm reading from Wikipedia now is a disproportionate role of high impact, hard to predict and rare

24:52.480 --> 24:57.120
events that are beyond the realm of normal expectations in history, science, finance

24:57.120 --> 24:58.000
and technology.

24:58.000 --> 25:01.760
So it's basically like it's the big one when the black swan comes up.

25:01.760 --> 25:07.680
In this scenario, Jesus second coming at the same time as Quetzalcoatl's first coming and

25:07.680 --> 25:11.040
they show up at the same time and they're like, oh, it's awkward.

25:12.480 --> 25:14.320
I can come back in a thousand years.

25:14.320 --> 25:17.600
You wreak havoc and then I'll come back and just sort of be the and they'll both want

25:17.600 --> 25:18.400
to be the hero.

25:18.400 --> 25:20.240
You know, no one wants to everyone.

25:20.240 --> 25:21.440
No one wants to be the opener.

25:21.440 --> 25:24.080
You know, everybody wants to close close out the stadium.

25:24.640 --> 25:25.680
So there.

25:25.680 --> 25:26.720
Oh, my God.

25:26.720 --> 25:28.640
Jesus riding Quetzalcoatl.

25:28.640 --> 25:29.920
Oh, we're all done.

25:29.920 --> 25:32.480
Well, had a good had a good ride.

25:32.480 --> 25:33.520
Humanity.

25:33.520 --> 25:35.680
I never get that tattoo.

25:36.880 --> 25:39.040
Jesus riding Quetzalcoatl would be a good tattoo.

25:39.040 --> 25:39.520
I would.

25:39.520 --> 25:42.320
That really makes people know that your country and proud.

25:42.320 --> 25:46.240
And then under it, under that picture, agriculture.

25:48.320 --> 25:52.960
Hey, guys, what's the non rudest way to walk away from a conversation in the office that

25:52.960 --> 25:55.040
you know you can't contribute to anymore?

25:55.040 --> 25:59.520
Like, say you're talking to someone and then someone else walks in and the conversation

25:59.520 --> 26:02.080
became all about mammals from that point on.

26:02.080 --> 26:06.480
Would you interrupt the dialogue to say I'm leaving now or would you just walk away silently?

26:06.480 --> 26:08.080
It's not like I don't like mammals.

26:08.080 --> 26:10.800
I just don't like talking about them sometimes.

26:10.800 --> 26:16.400
And that's from Mammals and Marmalade, who is a strange obsession they have.

26:16.400 --> 26:18.000
But I think you work at a zoo.

26:18.000 --> 26:18.720
We can help.

26:18.720 --> 26:22.560
Maybe I would I prefer to talk about reptiles today.

26:23.360 --> 26:24.560
No more mammals for me.

26:24.560 --> 26:25.520
I don't have anything to add.

26:27.040 --> 26:29.680
Reptiles are just scaly mammals, basically.

26:29.680 --> 26:30.800
Yeah, pretty much.

26:30.800 --> 26:35.120
I think the non rudest way is the most mysterious way.

26:36.320 --> 26:39.600
And that is to just wordlessly don't make a big deal out of it.

26:39.600 --> 26:43.040
Just turn and walk away, like mid sentence.

26:43.040 --> 26:44.160
But that's like super rude.

26:44.160 --> 26:50.800
But first, you got to get really big eyes and gasp a little bit.

26:52.160 --> 26:53.600
Like you saw a ghost?

26:53.600 --> 26:58.400
Yeah, just something where everybody now they're done talking about mammals because they're

26:58.400 --> 27:00.640
going to wonder what that weird shit you just did was.

27:00.640 --> 27:03.120
But you can do that like once ever.

27:03.120 --> 27:06.960
Yeah, it's not like a renewable resource of extricating yourself.

27:06.960 --> 27:11.200
And once once you do it once ever, they're going to come up to you immediately and be

27:11.200 --> 27:13.760
like, hey, hey, man, what's what the fuck?

27:13.760 --> 27:15.040
That was really weird.

27:15.040 --> 27:15.920
That was super weird.

27:15.920 --> 27:16.640
That thing you did.

27:17.680 --> 27:19.200
You look like you saw a black swan.

27:21.680 --> 27:22.960
Can we go more mysterious?

27:22.960 --> 27:25.120
Can you carry with you a pouch of smoke bombs?

27:26.720 --> 27:27.600
That's a throw one down.

27:28.640 --> 27:29.680
What's that in your other hand?

27:29.680 --> 27:31.760
Oh, it's a patch of it's a pouch of caltrops.

27:31.760 --> 27:33.200
You drop those in the smoke.

27:33.200 --> 27:34.240
They'll never find you.

27:34.240 --> 27:38.080
They'll try to, but they'll step on the caltrops and they'll never talk to you again.

27:38.080 --> 27:39.360
You'll probably get fired.

27:40.000 --> 27:42.400
This is not a good this is not not good advice.

27:42.400 --> 27:43.840
Smoke bomb, caltrops.

27:43.840 --> 27:44.880
Where did he go?

27:44.880 --> 27:46.880
He grappling hooked away because he's Tenshu.

27:48.080 --> 27:50.080
Don't worry about it.

27:50.080 --> 27:51.200
You also need a grappling hook.

27:51.200 --> 27:52.400
You need that.

27:52.400 --> 27:54.160
Basically a lot of ninja gear.

27:54.160 --> 27:55.200
Do you know about katanas?

27:59.840 --> 28:01.360
Maybe just hang around.

28:01.360 --> 28:04.720
Like you don't have to you don't have to.

28:04.720 --> 28:05.920
This is see, okay.

28:05.920 --> 28:07.040
Okay, I'm I'm on this.

28:08.400 --> 28:11.360
Here's the biggest misconception that people have about conversations.

28:12.080 --> 28:15.280
No one enters a conversation to listen to things.

28:15.280 --> 28:15.520
Nope.

28:16.160 --> 28:21.680
Everybody enters a conversation to to talk about things and force people to listen.

28:21.680 --> 28:26.800
The listening part is the is you paying the piper for all the talking you're going to do later.

28:26.800 --> 28:33.920
Mm-hmm, so if you are if you are in a conversation and you don't have anything to add you are like

28:33.920 --> 28:38.880
you're sitting pretty because you can just pile up debt of listening.

28:38.880 --> 28:43.280
Like you can really be a great listener because you're in that very rare position

28:43.280 --> 28:46.480
of not having anything to say and no one wants you to talk.

28:46.480 --> 28:48.320
No one ever wants anyone else to talk.

28:48.320 --> 28:51.840
All anyone ever wants is to talk and have everyone hang on their words.

28:51.840 --> 28:57.040
So you're not holding up your end of the social bargain here.

28:57.040 --> 28:58.480
This is so just stand there.

28:58.480 --> 29:03.760
So you're saying you wait you wait it out like a storm and then you say are we done with mammals?

29:03.760 --> 29:07.520
And they say yeah, you say good because it's time to talk about Doctor Who.

29:07.520 --> 29:08.480
Strap in.

29:08.480 --> 29:09.600
It's strap in.

29:09.600 --> 29:11.120
It's Doctor Who time.

29:11.120 --> 29:14.400
I'll take it a step further and I'll look at it like that.

29:14.400 --> 29:19.520
But then when they leave a window open leave a door open like they mentioned a doctor and

29:19.520 --> 29:22.800
then you jump right in there and you that is Travis.

29:22.800 --> 29:27.120
That is the Travis McElroy method and you pretend like you just invented that as a goof

29:27.120 --> 29:27.600
for this podcast.

29:27.600 --> 29:28.640
No, I'm not at all.

29:28.640 --> 29:32.960
You wedge yourself right in the conversation and say did you mention doctors?

29:32.960 --> 29:33.840
Like no, I didn't.

29:33.840 --> 29:36.640
Like well now that we have let's talk about Doctor Who.

29:36.640 --> 29:37.360
Okay.

29:37.360 --> 29:38.320
Yeah, that's my move.

29:38.320 --> 29:39.920
That's not like a good move though.

29:39.920 --> 29:42.400
We've been trying to get you to stop pulling that move forever.

29:44.400 --> 29:48.720
You say that but I mean I know you're wondering for a while now and I know you're wondering

29:48.720 --> 29:49.680
about this.

29:49.680 --> 29:50.800
This bleeding headband.

29:50.800 --> 29:56.960
I was in a horrible accident and I just got back from the doctor and oh hey.

29:56.960 --> 29:57.200
Hey.

29:59.440 --> 30:00.160
I loved it.

30:00.160 --> 30:00.640
I loved it.

30:00.640 --> 30:01.680
Did you hear about the new companion?

30:01.680 --> 30:02.320
It's crazy.

30:03.360 --> 30:04.480
What were you saying?

30:04.480 --> 30:05.200
Oh, you're dead.

30:05.760 --> 30:06.000
Fuck.

30:07.520 --> 30:07.760
Sorry.

30:07.760 --> 30:09.280
I forgot I was driving to the hospital.

30:10.160 --> 30:12.800
His next words were gonna be I need you to shoot this needle into my heart.

30:14.480 --> 30:18.160
And you know you and the worst part is not that they died but because you've always wanted

30:18.160 --> 30:18.720
to try that.

30:19.280 --> 30:22.480
You've always wanted to try to jam a needle into somebody's heart full of what do they

30:22.480 --> 30:22.880
put in there?

30:22.880 --> 30:23.680
Adrenaline?

30:23.680 --> 30:24.880
Mountain Dew.

30:25.840 --> 30:26.800
Mountain Dew?

30:26.800 --> 30:27.200
Search.

30:28.800 --> 30:29.520
Josta.

30:29.520 --> 30:30.080
Josta.

30:30.080 --> 30:31.040
Ah fuck.

30:31.040 --> 30:31.440
Damn it.

30:32.000 --> 30:33.440
Just sit there and listen.

30:33.440 --> 30:33.680
Yeah.

30:33.680 --> 30:35.040
What's the worst that could happen?

30:35.040 --> 30:39.120
What a nice situation to be in and not be expected to contribute anything.

30:39.120 --> 30:39.760
Just sit there and listen.

30:39.760 --> 30:45.120
And if there's enough people in the circle like if we're talking like one on one or

30:45.120 --> 30:50.480
like three people you gotta stand there forever like until it naturally breaks up.

30:50.480 --> 30:55.200
But if you're like in a group of like eight, nine people no one cares if you're there or

30:55.200 --> 30:55.360
not.

30:55.360 --> 31:00.640
If you're in a big circle full of people and they're all talking remember that God gave

31:00.640 --> 31:04.720
you two ears and one mouth for a reason.

31:04.720 --> 31:11.120
But he also gave you two legs and two arms which is four so maybe jump in the middle

31:11.120 --> 31:12.640
of the circle and just dance.

31:12.640 --> 31:13.360
Pray dance.

31:13.360 --> 31:15.120
Just dance away.

31:15.120 --> 31:16.160
Just bust a move.

31:16.160 --> 31:17.600
Just bust a move.

31:17.600 --> 31:22.640
Just start dancing because you that is gonna that will be a new topic of conversation.

31:23.280 --> 31:27.600
Especially if you start slowly at first and just like build up to it.

31:27.600 --> 31:29.840
Do you mean like you ease into the move?

31:29.840 --> 31:30.800
What?

31:30.800 --> 31:32.800
What are you saying about mammals?

31:32.800 --> 31:36.240
Yeah my favorite mammal is a blue whale.

31:36.240 --> 31:36.720
Here we go.

31:39.200 --> 31:41.280
And you gotta make these mouth noises too.

31:41.280 --> 31:41.520
Yeah.

31:41.520 --> 31:43.120
That's cute.

31:43.120 --> 31:45.200
Man I sure hope blue whales are mammal.

31:45.840 --> 31:48.000
Oh boy howdy do I ever.

31:48.000 --> 31:50.560
We are gonna get emails about that if incorrect.

31:51.280 --> 31:53.680
Okay and that's also great because then you'll be fired.

31:54.640 --> 31:55.920
Well I don't think you'll be fired.

31:56.480 --> 31:57.600
I think you'll be promoted.

31:58.400 --> 31:59.040
Yeah.

31:59.040 --> 31:59.280
Chief dancer.

31:59.280 --> 32:00.080
Which is the opposite.

32:00.720 --> 32:04.240
I recently turned 23 and my parents pulled the Prius promise on me.

32:04.240 --> 32:07.200
Two days before my birthday they asked what I wanted as a present.

32:07.200 --> 32:11.040
I told them I wanted a high quality camera which is something I was planning to buy for

32:11.040 --> 32:11.520
myself.

32:12.720 --> 32:16.000
On the day of my birthday they told me they were still looking into what camera to get

32:16.000 --> 32:20.560
and didn't have anything for me and it's been a few weeks and I'm not and now I'm not sure

32:20.560 --> 32:22.000
how they're going to get it for me at all.

32:23.920 --> 32:26.080
In which case I would just buy the camera myself.

32:26.080 --> 32:30.640
But I don't want to do that if they've already ordered it online or something.

32:30.640 --> 32:34.320
How do I broach the subject without putting them on the spot?

32:34.320 --> 32:38.960
Or how long should I wait before I can safely assume they won't be getting me the camera?

32:38.960 --> 32:41.120
Now it's from Camera Shine California.

32:41.120 --> 32:41.620
Oof.

32:45.120 --> 32:51.120
I have been in this position almost exactly and it is the worst because basically what

32:51.120 --> 32:54.400
you're saying is hey when are you going to give me that present?

32:54.960 --> 32:55.460
Yeah.

32:57.440 --> 33:02.480
Here's here's the here's one of the big mistakes you made and this is a tricky this is a tricky

33:02.480 --> 33:07.920
thing but if you care about something especially if it's a big purchase you should never let

33:07.920 --> 33:12.400
anyone make it for you like exactly it never especially with that fucking camera there's

33:12.400 --> 33:18.560
so many variables so many does it take pictures does it not what yeah high quality video low

33:18.560 --> 33:24.880
quality video instant facebook posting nude pics for sexting sexting does it have something

33:24.880 --> 33:30.800
sexed is it sexed enabled there's so many choices you gotta just hand them a pic this

33:30.800 --> 33:37.040
isn't like this isn't like kid stuff at christmas where you could get the big toy book get a

33:37.040 --> 33:41.520
red marker and just circle 50 things and say like i can't wait for santa to get here this

33:41.520 --> 33:47.120
isn't like that can you get on can you kick start can you kick start a camera are you

33:47.120 --> 33:51.680
asking are you telling this person to ask their dad to kick start for the camera no

33:51.680 --> 33:55.440

33:55.440 --> 34:03.040
starter the program you have to start your dad yeah hey yeah kick start my dad don't

34:03.040 --> 34:16.160
you know uh griffin yeah is it time yet yeah sure this yahoo answer was sent in by lisa

34:16.160 --> 34:23.360
holofield thank you lisa it's by yahoo answers user buddhist prime who asks is it illegal

34:23.360 --> 34:30.160
to take pictures of adults sleeping on college grounds after class when they are tired as

34:30.160 --> 34:37.760
long as i am not profiting from it okay wait people may not like it people who are awake

34:37.760 --> 34:41.920
watching me take pictures of others may have a hissy fit about it but there's nothing illegal

34:41.920 --> 34:46.400
about it right and if they get confrontational with me or put their hands on me i can report

34:46.400 --> 34:50.520
them to the police and they can go to jail right because people who do that have serious

34:50.520 --> 34:55.820
issues and need to be identified before they can become a later risk potential ultimately

34:55.820 --> 35:00.200
i want to petition the dean for sleep capsules to be installed so that students including

35:00.200 --> 35:04.600
myself can rejuvenate our tired minds and do better in school and i would use the sleeping

35:04.600 --> 35:11.200
students pictures as evidence for this whoa several issues hold on hold on oh my god this

35:11.200 --> 35:16.200
rabbit hole goes so deep but first off let's just get this out of the way by students they

35:16.200 --> 35:22.120
mean girls and by girls they mean attractive girls and by the dean they mean their penis

35:22.120 --> 35:27.800
and by sleep capsules they may actually be talking about sleep castles that may actually

35:27.800 --> 35:32.720
be on the level that that's weird enough to actually be be accurate and just just so i

35:32.720 --> 35:39.480
know in what way would you profit from taking pictures of sleeping people what what is like

35:39.480 --> 35:45.640
a coffee table book there's a market for all that traffic you can sell pictures of anything

35:45.640 --> 35:53.120
look at yesterday i looked for pictures of a bull in a china shop but also all the but

35:53.120 --> 35:57.640
a candy shop instead because it was to illustrate a very important post i was reading my writing

35:57.640 --> 36:02.760
from my live journal and i had to go to a one of the stock photo places and search for

36:02.760 --> 36:08.160
like bull in a candy shop and i got a lot of results that i did not enjoy seeing but

36:08.160 --> 36:15.020
i but but i had to do it people buy pictures of anything weird anything sleeping people

36:15.020 --> 36:20.400
dead people don't kill the people that are sleeping don't kill no don't kill things

36:20.400 --> 36:26.520
that are illegal this thing that you've described maybe maybe killing it definitely killing

36:26.520 --> 36:32.800
people definitely 100 um so don't do that part i don't know if you take a if you take

36:32.800 --> 36:36.880
a here's the thing if you take a picture of me and i'm asleep and all you do is show it

36:36.880 --> 36:43.200
to the dean i won't know about it look at griffin look at how pitiful he looks i can't

36:43.200 --> 36:48.840
do anything about it i'm so tired i got a little sunburn yesterday i can barely move

36:48.840 --> 36:55.140
i can't chase you down i think that this is probably one of those things that may not

36:55.140 --> 37:00.800
be outright illegal but if i catch you doing it i will find a way to make it illegal like

37:00.800 --> 37:05.320
i will claim it in a way that will make it sound really you'll take them to nickelodeon

37:05.320 --> 37:10.680
kids court and yeah you'll sue them on like judge judy or something there's no legal

37:10.680 --> 37:16.480
precedent for this but sir i mean it's pretty pretty skeezy i guess if i see a picture

37:16.480 --> 37:22.040
of you taking a picture of an asleep person i will find an adult and they will take they

37:22.040 --> 37:26.640
will take an adult i will go get a teacher and i will make them do something can you

37:26.640 --> 37:33.800
imagine if you were the dean and brother rolled up with just like 500 pictures and just like

37:33.800 --> 37:39.400
slammed them down on your desk i could really go for a napparoo so here's some some smut

37:39.400 --> 37:48.440
maybe like very particular smut this might be smutty uh here's here's the thing you fucking

37:48.440 --> 37:53.720
creep and i hate to poo poo your pet project here but they already have sleep capsules

37:53.720 --> 37:59.720
you know what they're called bedrooms go to them and fucking sleep in them you weirdo

37:59.720 --> 38:04.320
i don't care that you're in college and you're discovering your body and you're questioning

38:04.320 --> 38:09.680
your faith i don't give a shit about any of that go to like a bank go to the mall go to

38:09.680 --> 38:13.920
a place where real people are doing actual things and see how many of these fucking people

38:13.920 --> 38:19.560
said oh i'm sleepy i'm gonna lay down on the ground and i just wish there was a capsule

38:19.560 --> 38:24.000
here that i could sleep in and you know what i find funny as you've been describing this

38:24.000 --> 38:29.760
justin if this person were doing it as an art project there'd be nothing weird about

38:29.760 --> 38:36.000
this right it's the sleep capsule thing what the fuck is a sleep capsule i think you're

38:36.000 --> 38:41.360
a tanning bed i picture a tanning he shouldn't be he shouldn't be penalized for having a

38:41.360 --> 38:45.800
functional project creepy as though it may be because i don't know if you guys know this

38:45.800 --> 38:51.200
sleepiness in college it's an epidemic it's taking over the world that's why we have like

38:51.200 --> 38:56.040
five hour energy drinks and sleeping do you know what's in those sleep you know do you

38:56.040 --> 38:59.920
know how much vitamin b is in a five hour energy drink what the percentage is if you're

38:59.920 --> 39:05.960
doing enough to get me going 8333 percent that's a little bit too much b just a touch

39:05.960 --> 39:10.440
too much b in those can i ask you guys a serious question about five hour energy drink that

39:10.440 --> 39:13.880
i've had forever yeah are you sterile because of all the five hour energy drinks you drink

39:13.880 --> 39:19.200
no i know why i'm sterile on the commercial it's what's your reason it's because i make

39:19.200 --> 39:25.120
god mad um on the commercial for five hour energy it says if you're not sure how it'll

39:25.120 --> 39:31.720
affect you to drink half at first does that give you 50 energy for five hours or two and

39:31.720 --> 39:37.500
a half hours of 100 energy it's not see you think that it stacks like that but i had a

39:37.500 --> 39:46.200
friend who uh wanted to uh stay up for an entire day so uh he he drank five of them

39:46.200 --> 39:51.240
like in a row just like bam bam bam bam bam and then he uh jumped up and he kicked the

39:51.240 --> 39:59.520
sun and he burned it he burned to death and the sun's obviously in the sun's heat he died

39:59.520 --> 40:02.960
that was the weirdest episode of jersey sure if you guys have never seen that one tracking

40:02.960 --> 40:10.120
down uh what a twist hey here's my problem with the sleep capsules okay how do you explain

40:10.120 --> 40:17.720
to a local homeless that you have a bed but this one is closer to the chick filet on campus

40:17.720 --> 40:22.720
yeah so you're gonna sleep there if that's cool and by the way sir if you could please

40:22.720 --> 40:29.960
not sleep in it even though right you're homeless yeah how do you how do you have that conversation

40:29.960 --> 40:35.080
with them not that you should talk to them but how if they were to approach you right

40:35.080 --> 40:40.200
flailing wildly and shouting about whatever it is they do you know how they would be i'm

40:40.200 --> 40:45.800
not interacting with them myself i live in a i live in a small town but um how i imagine

40:45.800 --> 40:49.440
they are how would you have that conversation with them that you had that this is second

40:49.440 --> 40:57.840
bed and they can't they can't get near it it's more like charge a nickel yeah most um

40:57.840 --> 41:04.040
you charge a nickel into the bed into the bed i so you're saying that that if i was

41:04.040 --> 41:10.720
a homeless person for for the princely sum of five cents a night i could have i could

41:10.720 --> 41:16.120
have a home is that i don't know how the homeless economy works justin a lot of misconceptions

41:16.120 --> 41:20.320
here uh you don't get a whole night's worth of sleep for five cents in the sleep capsule

41:20.320 --> 41:26.120
you get 20 you get a 20 minute energon nap and then the sound of sirens uh wakes you

41:26.120 --> 41:31.240
up and then you can you can put another nickel in but it's it just adds to your time what

41:31.240 --> 41:38.320
do you guys think the perfect nap length is what's 20 minutes see i i usually need 25

41:38.320 --> 41:44.240
minutes for that five minutes of get in get in that head space i need to get in the head

41:44.240 --> 41:48.840
space and i'm going to take a nap maybe the sleep capsule has some sort of tech in it

41:48.840 --> 41:54.360
that just like maybe like a hammer just like bang just like hits you right in the center

41:54.360 --> 41:58.400
like in both temples at once and you die for just like 20 minutes but then you come back

41:58.400 --> 42:01.720
out of it because there's a needle a needle that comes out and shoots mountain dew into

42:01.720 --> 42:08.300
your heart oh and there's an adjacent flatliners booth so you you can pay a nickel and flatliners

42:08.300 --> 42:13.580
with somebody as they take a death nap in the an adjacent capsule is that yeah basically

42:13.580 --> 42:20.160
the way i understand it right sure yep okay with a homeless man standing guard why do

42:20.160 --> 42:27.200
we not pay the homeless to guard our sleep slash flatliners capsules and that way they

42:27.200 --> 42:31.440
wouldn't have they wouldn't get a it'd be a good steady work and we're creating jobs

42:31.440 --> 42:38.120
you're welcome obama welcome obama and all we have to do to get this plan to revitalize

42:38.120 --> 42:45.400
our country's uh business sector to shoot mountain dew into its its full its failing

42:45.400 --> 42:50.360

this only second time i've flown somewhere uh but it is also my first time flying alone

48:40.520 --> 48:44.600
despite the fact that i am handsome and manly i'm also claustrophobic and afraid of heights

48:44.600 --> 48:49.120
which makes hurtling through a tube in the sky rather stressful what can i do to keep

48:49.120 --> 48:54.320
myself from having a panic attack that's from airborne in austin this is my this is my no

48:54.320 --> 49:02.120
fail uh pleasurable flying plan so you go to the airport right make sure you get there

49:02.120 --> 49:08.240
with enough time uh to to so it's not going to be stressful for you you go you don't drink

49:08.240 --> 49:14.120
any caffeine that's key you go to the gift shop you get yourself some dramamine what's

49:14.120 --> 49:19.960
that you're not motion sick i don't give a shit you buy yourself some dramamine you uh

49:19.960 --> 49:25.960

53:27.080 --> 53:34.680
is to not leave the cockpit and start talking about 9-11 that's like the one thing you don't

53:34.680 --> 53:40.940
have to do if you could not do that one thing your job is you are like 75 of the way there

53:40.940 --> 53:45.680
after that it's just looking good and banging stewardesses but you know though this this

53:45.680 --> 53:50.340
pilot though might have been going out of his way for customer service what do i mean

53:50.340 --> 53:56.200
you ask i'll explain please do because right now this is crazy i fly on an airplane what

53:56.200 --> 54:02.240
i want every time i have the experience and i know i know but what i want is an experience

54:02.240 --> 54:08.680
in which upon landing the plane the entire uh the entire flight just erupts into applause

54:08.680 --> 54:14.400
okay okay like we're just so happy to have landed okay like we did it we've done it and

54:14.400 --> 54:21.160
nothing says i'm so glad to have landed like a crazy sky scared pilot what you're saying

54:21.160 --> 54:27.600
you are giving me the tyler durden tomorrow when you wake up after this flight your cereal

54:27.600 --> 54:32.120
tastes better than it ever has before is that what you're telling me i've gotten halfway

54:32.120 --> 54:37.180
there i've flown on a flight at christmas where we sang christmas carols in midair

54:37.180 --> 54:42.040
during turbulence that's fucking beautiful are you kidding me yeah but we didn't applaud

54:42.040 --> 54:47.440
when we landed i tried and nobody joined in with me hey travis if i want to appreciate

54:47.440 --> 54:54.360
the life christy's given me i'll read a mitch album book okay for the duration of the flight

54:54.360 --> 55:00.160
if the pilot could just not leave the cockpit and talk about 9-11 and i'll be back here

55:00.160 --> 55:05.880
reading tuesday's with mori sir if i became on the intercom and which is like hello ladies

55:05.880 --> 55:11.520
and gentlemen i just want to take a second to talk to you about uh 9-11 is it it it was

55:11.520 --> 55:16.280
if you watch the videos if you watch the videos can you do the voice like travis yeah i'm

55:16.280 --> 55:20.520
talking in my hands uh if you watch the videos on youtube they explain a lot new world order

55:20.520 --> 55:26.040
illuminati there were missiles on the plane oh oops if i see the pilot on a flight that

55:26.040 --> 55:32.640
i'm on i'm like well that's it i'm dead i'm dead i will look out the window fully expecting

55:32.640 --> 55:37.400
us to be fucking flying into the hungry mouth of a volcano because that's where i think

55:37.400 --> 55:43.720
we are there's nothing you want to say less than a than the pilot i can oh the pilot's

55:43.720 --> 55:49.320
just walking in the bathroom to take a shit i don't care i saw him leave his charge if

55:49.320 --> 55:54.640
i'm if i'm at terminal b and i see a pilot at the chile's express i'm going to defecate

55:54.640 --> 55:59.780
my pants i don't want to see any pilots ever they have one plate they should be surgically

55:59.780 --> 56:03.580
attached to the cockpit that's where they belong don't get out of there it's a one day

56:03.580 --> 56:11.280
you can't do do you know who do you know if there was another pilot like on the plane

56:11.280 --> 56:15.680
that went into the cockpit and helped them land it yeah that's gonna give you a false

56:15.680 --> 56:19.560
sense of security right that you just always assume there's another one there's a backup

56:19.560 --> 56:24.480
pilot sure if your first if your first one breaks down absolutely dope is that guy though

56:24.480 --> 56:30.000
don't worry i got this i've got this you know what in the footage that i saw it definitely

56:30.000 --> 56:33.960
looked like he was wearing a uniform are they like spider-man like they have to keep it

56:33.960 --> 56:39.720
on well you know the pilot's life is a horrible horrible life to lead because imagine when

56:39.720 --> 56:43.520
justin you and i both work at home so like punching out not a big deal like we can just

56:43.520 --> 56:48.680
go in the kitchen and now we're eating a sandwich travis you have to drive home uh when you

56:48.680 --> 56:53.160
punch the clock uh pilot he could punch the clock and be like ah fuck what like where

56:53.160 --> 56:59.000
i'm in tokyo god damn it i gotta go get on a plane and get home to i just assumed they

56:59.000 --> 57:03.680
were nomadic and just sat down wherever the plane landed you think home is whatever port

57:03.680 --> 57:09.120
yeah exactly that's merchants but that's i don't think that's how it i don't think that's

57:09.120 --> 57:14.600
i'm almost certain they are they are citizens of no land right they have no allegiance to

57:14.600 --> 57:18.600
that's why if you're gonna go to war the first ones you should court are the pilots because

57:18.600 --> 57:24.600
they have no allegiance to any swath of land they say they say no no territory but the

57:24.600 --> 57:29.960
sky no race but the blue and that's their sort of credo that's their motto that's their

57:29.960 --> 57:35.160
house words basically that was the nerdiest that was the single nerdiest paragraph you've

57:35.160 --> 57:40.400
ever i didn't come up with it griffin blame the pilots maybe the fact that maybe they

57:40.400 --> 57:43.200
don't have enough stress they obviously don't have anything to worry about maybe you should

57:43.200 --> 57:47.280
pile your complaints on with them things are obviously good luck finding them because they're

57:47.280 --> 57:51.760
always on the move you can't track them down you can't crush them you have to work from

57:51.760 --> 57:57.280
the inside and they have diplomatic immunity is that true that's true pilots can do anything

57:57.280 --> 58:00.800
it's not considered a crime pilot cannot be charged for anything there's actually only

58:00.800 --> 58:06.520
one there's only really only one like uh i would say like no no if you're a pilot can

58:06.520 --> 58:12.960
you guess what it is did you did you guess leaving the cockpit and talking about 9 11

58:12.960 --> 58:17.440
because that is exactly it that's the one thing you can't do that will get you that

58:17.440 --> 58:23.680
will get you uh excommunicated from the church of flying that's a really bad thing to do

58:23.680 --> 58:28.760
and then you got to start paying taxes again one one thing just one last actionable thing

58:28.760 --> 58:34.360
for realsies this is 100 like i don't like flying really either but the one thing that

58:34.360 --> 58:40.480
i do that helps me lock down my sky scaredness my sky fear is uh just look at the stewardess

58:40.480 --> 58:45.320
and look at how bored she looks or look at the steward that was my thing i think i told

58:45.320 --> 58:50.160
you that and i think you took that to heart look at the flight look at the flight attendant

58:50.160 --> 58:55.360
and just look at how bored they look and just think like this is even when it gets rough

58:55.360 --> 58:59.320
even when it gets choppy if they are flying into the mouth of a volcano a flight attendant

58:59.320 --> 59:04.880
will just you know just keep on keep on reading hunger games not a big deal not a big deal

59:04.880 --> 59:08.240
they'll keep reading their people magazine and they won't even trust the pilot trust

59:08.240 --> 59:12.480
the plane unless that but i bet you that's the worst fear in the world because they think

59:12.480 --> 59:16.840
everything's cool and locked down 100 of the time and that's why they look bored and the

59:16.840 --> 59:21.640
pilot snaps and it's like 9 11 i bet you the fear that they feel it's like when superman

59:21.640 --> 59:29.400
feels pain for the first time i bet you they just they just shit to death in seconds they

59:29.400 --> 59:35.340
yeah it's it's uh it's got to be a spooky one because you've got to tell yourself that

59:35.340 --> 59:39.640
nothing ever happens on plane yeah you've got to that's what you got to promise that's

59:39.640 --> 59:43.760
what you have to keep telling yourself how about a yahoo answer yeah that sounds good

59:43.760 --> 59:50.440
this yahoo was sent in by joanna heinz thank you joanna it's by yahoo answers user stupidass

59:50.440 --> 59:59.600
who asks what's his username though uh it's carl weathers fan 2011 okay uh carl weathers

59:59.600 --> 01:00:08.360
fan 2011 asks penis stuck in a cd tray i thought it would be funny but then i got sucked in

01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:15.080
i am in incredible pain i can't get it put what do i do butter doesn't work this is actually

01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:19.400
horrifyingly uh close to some of the emails we get from first-time listeners i'll tell

01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:24.560
you what you don't do press the close button yeah well it sounds like he has already committed

01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:31.040
that particular foible right so wait he put okay so he put his penis in the cd tray sure

01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:37.640
and closed it i think it may have it may have been an auto close situation you know if you

01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:41.040
leave the cd tray out for too long they don't want you to slip and step on it and then break

01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:46.920
your computer so then i assume he just immediately killed himself yeah what kind of what kind

01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:51.120
of first off let me just get this out of the way hit me if this is some kind of viral thing

01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:55.820
for there's something about mary too there's something else about mary i'm gonna be something

01:00:55.820 --> 01:01:02.760
more about mary than we have yet to discover dumb and dumber dumb and dumber um that then

01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:09.320
i will be very put out secondly who is using cd players who is out there putting you deserve

01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:13.440
it you know what maybe this is amish they're they're not used to dealing with zippers so

01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:19.880
they don't have a sort of a perennial fear about their um dong zones well this this could

01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:26.520
also be a like a cd or dvd drive on like a computer but like even then like who doesn't

01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:29.820
just download all their shit like you can't get your you can't get your penis stuck in

01:01:29.820 --> 01:01:36.380
steam you know guys you're missing you're missing my question sorry travis go ahead

01:01:36.380 --> 01:01:41.040
what kind of goof is this yeah what how did this happen i did it to be funny maybe it's

01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:48.360
okay in what context maybe it's like a lo-fi high-tech bris right was somebody else using

01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:53.400
the computer you stuck up behind them and put your penis in the disk drive oops got

01:01:53.400 --> 01:02:00.960
you oh no don't close it there's a few things i would say there's a few things in the world

01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:07.700
maybe a small handful that you shouldn't put your penis in uh like crocodiles a crocodile's

01:02:07.700 --> 01:02:16.720
mouth kardashian well i was gonna say like a cigar cutter but you okay i was i'm talking

01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:23.640
about novelty guillotine yeah uh a refrigerator door a freezer door a toaster oven there's

01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:27.600
actually you know what there's a lot there's actually like just one or two things that

01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:34.680
you it's actually okay to vagina some buttholes people that's it thank you that's it and pumps

01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:40.240
for some of us that's not okay actually a pump is okay no because i can really get to

01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:46.460
know the pump first i could search yahoo answers for penis pump oops and i would get 10 responses

01:02:46.460 --> 01:02:54.520
each of which say butter doesn't work i would say griffin that if you search penis blank

01:02:54.520 --> 01:03:00.120
oops like anything in the middle there the number one response is going to be butter

01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:03.800
doesn't work it's it's turning green oh god oh god oh god oh god it's turning green help

01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:09.880
me something like this is okay so i have in in the hundred episodes of doing the show

01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:16.040
what i've learned is to not judge anybody for the stuff that they are into correct agreed

01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:23.320
so if this dude had put like i wanted to bone my computer yeah so i put my penis in it yeah

01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:29.640
i'd be like you know what i i i don't i don't necessarily subscribe to that but go for it

01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:33.880
there's so many sharp edges though but to do it as a goof there's also better ports

01:03:33.880 --> 01:03:41.800
that you could choose but to do it what's that travis what what's that travis what port

01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:47.960
do you have usb 4.0 and this time we shaped it like a vagina for goofs he puts it in it

01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:53.000
put it in his a tappy i got this i guarantee this new thunderbolt there is somewhere a

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:57.760
weird thing that you can hook up to a usb port that is a vagina a usb vagina you're

01:03:57.760 --> 01:04:03.920
right you're probably right i know i'm right this is the thing though this is 2012 right

01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:08.760
now and this is what's so frustrating and this kind of goes back to your like you know

01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:15.040
different strokes literally for different folks um if you want to fuck it there's probably

01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:20.520
a web page that tells you how to like sort of say in a safe space safe for discussion

01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:26.140
and also safe in the sense that like oh god oh no how can i don't know yeah not my genitals

01:04:26.140 --> 01:04:31.560
please but like these are my favorite

01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:37.400
you can just do a little research next time that is not and then don't try to cover it

01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:41.500
up by saying i thought it would be funny here's be honest with yourself you wanted to bone

01:04:41.500 --> 01:04:48.380

of prevention yeah right that says there's net he's never been so happy to have that

01:05:35.100 --> 01:05:39.340
wireless keyboard you know because he thought it was an expense it's the ultimate catch

01:05:39.340 --> 01:05:44.360
22 because the only way you can free his penis is by turning the computer off and freeing

01:05:44.360 --> 01:05:49.560
him himself from his lifeless jaws but the only way you can do that is to turn it off

01:05:49.560 --> 01:05:56.360
and then not get that answer from yahoo answers catch 22 catch 22 he dies again this is another

01:05:56.360 --> 01:06:01.600
my baby just drank a bunch of alcohol question yeah maybe going to yahoo answers isn't your

01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:09.160
best outlet okay travis what other thing what other bulletin board on the planet is going

to know how to solve this particular pickle a doctor this is the first i you could read

01:06:14.440 --> 01:06:19.160
every medical journal on the planet and stuck my disc dick in a disc drive is not going

01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:24.300
to show up not going to ping any results and travis where was your fucking folksy bland

01:06:24.300 --> 01:06:29.520
of home brand of homespun wisdom back before he put his dick in a computer yeah where were

01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:45.160
really you don't want it to you know i think that's a great litmus test yeah with my hometown

01:06:45.160 --> 01:06:49.800
old-timey documents still hands out lollipops are proof of me stinking my dick in this for

01:06:49.800 --> 01:06:56.520
goofs um and it was not forgives it was not forgives it was not you were trying to create

01:06:56.520 --> 01:07:03.120
a cyborg hybrid but this is not this is not how a sanctioned way to do it this is how

01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:06.640
you get your dick in a computer forever you have to carry this computer you're gonna walk

01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:10.520
your daughter down the aisle with your dick in this you're gonna have your cpu in one

01:07:10.520 --> 01:07:15.960
hand your daughter in the other so just enjoy that lifestyle is that what you would like

01:07:15.960 --> 01:07:21.440
can't fly anymore because you can't get it through the security i bet that'd be one way

01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:25.560
to deal with your sky fear though this is just let's just let your dick just get well

01:07:25.560 --> 01:07:30.360
because after that you got nothing to be afraid of like what's gonna happen to you after you

01:07:30.360 --> 01:07:35.160
get your dick stuck in a computer forever like that gives you a really great like point

01:07:35.160 --> 01:07:41.480
