00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:49.040
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me, an advice show for the modern

00:49.040 --> 00:58.640
era. Cyber Monday is here, and I'm Justin Cyber McElroy. And I'm Travis, Mr. Roboto McElroy.

00:58.640 --> 01:03.520
ASL, it's Griffin McElroy, your youngest baby brother. I put on my wizard hat,

01:03.520 --> 01:09.520
and prepare my body for you. This is the value day, folks. If you head over to

01:12.000 --> 01:17.120
the number one shopping site in the world, BezosPlace.com, if you go to BezosPlace,

01:17.120 --> 01:21.680
you can get a bunch of great deals on all the latest and greatest in tech toys,

01:21.680 --> 01:27.680
gadgets and gizmos, plenty. Finally fucking put Toys R Us out of business this year,

01:27.680 --> 01:31.760
so we're all kind of on a high from that. And who will be next in 2019?

01:31.760 --> 01:34.000
Yeah, let's see who you want to see Bezos eat next.

01:37.440 --> 01:41.520
I'd say Brookstone's had it fucking coming for a while, huh? You got your expensive, like,

01:41.520 --> 01:48.720
you know, $240 Wi-Fi enabled nutcracker. Bezos comes around. Now, Brookstone's in me. I am

01:48.720 --> 01:54.320
Brookstone. I don't know that Skywall still exists. I mean, Bezos might have already eaten that one.

01:54.320 --> 02:00.640
He got that one. He got that one already? Fuck. He travels a lot. He's on planes a lot. He sees it.

02:00.640 --> 02:05.840
He gets hungry. Bezos is going to eat the air mall. You know what I would like to see? I think

02:05.840 --> 02:10.880
that he has conquered it to the point where I think Bezos needs to walk away from Amazon,

02:10.880 --> 02:17.120
leave all his money behind and start again and see how long it takes him to catch back up to Amazon.

02:17.120 --> 02:19.520
Yeah, if you think you're such hot shit. Yeah.

02:19.520 --> 02:25.600
Yeah. So what you did at once, anybody can make a multi-billion dollar company once.

02:25.600 --> 02:28.880
Do it again if you're such hot shit. And now you know what you're doing enough

02:28.880 --> 02:31.920
that I feel like you could catch back up in like five years.

02:31.920 --> 02:37.920
Yeah, why don't you just sort of send everyone, you know, $2.4 million, which as far as I know,

02:37.920 --> 02:45.200
you can do. And then let's see what else you innovate there, you lucky dipshit.

02:45.200 --> 02:47.840
Got him.

02:48.640 --> 02:52.880
I could do another one right. I could do one right now. A sequel to Amazon. Here's,

02:52.880 --> 02:54.320
do you want to hear it? Please.

02:54.320 --> 02:57.840
Yeah. This is the new one. This is the new one. Okay.

02:58.880 --> 03:03.760
You know how they have, if you get prime with them, you get two day, free two day shipping.

03:07.120 --> 03:10.240
I'm going to go for free one day shipping. Okay.

03:10.960 --> 03:14.880
How about that? Like, how about that? Now I'm bigger than Amazon.

03:14.880 --> 03:16.720
Yeah. It wasn't hard.

03:16.720 --> 03:19.760
Can I pitch one? Can I pitch one? Can I pitch one?

03:19.760 --> 03:20.160
Yeah.

03:20.160 --> 03:24.160
With every $30 purchase or more, one free back rub.

03:24.880 --> 03:27.040
From Beesbos?

03:27.040 --> 03:30.160
No, here's the thing. From whoever you want.

03:30.160 --> 03:34.480
Oh, wow. And this is now a legal law of the land?

03:34.480 --> 03:35.040
Yeah.

03:35.040 --> 03:41.360
Can I do this to, you know, Tony Romo? Can I just say Tony Romo? Come rub these shoulders. Okay.

03:41.360 --> 03:45.360
Now you will have to schedule. I mean, like, if you're like Oscar Isaacs,

03:45.360 --> 03:49.360
like I need, I need that back rub. Like you're going to have to schedule it.

03:49.360 --> 03:53.840
You know what I mean? Like he's probably pre booked up at this point.

03:53.840 --> 04:00.320
You know, it's a good thing that I don't run Amazon. This is why I can't be a big rich hot

04:00.320 --> 04:02.480
shot like Jeff Beesbo. This is why. Okay.

04:02.480 --> 04:08.960
It's because I would wait until Cyber Monday and then I would just put an animated video of myself

04:08.960 --> 04:13.360
and with Flash on the front page of website and just say, it's all books again.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.440
Now it's just books again.

04:17.440 --> 04:22.560
Buy it or don't. I don't care. I'm incredibly wealthy, but this one is just books.

04:22.560 --> 04:22.960
Damn.

04:22.960 --> 04:24.640
I'm doing this for books.

04:24.640 --> 04:28.000
I should have never gotten away from books. It's all books again.

04:28.000 --> 04:33.920
I love petulant Cyber Beesbos saying, oh, we'll pay our workers a fair living wage.

04:33.920 --> 04:41.360
In exchange, it's all books again. Not going to get your Black Friday Cyber Monday deals on those

04:41.360 --> 04:44.800
house slippers unless you're going to shove your paws into two big books.

04:45.600 --> 04:49.760
I hope you enjoy your dash button for kitty litter. Press it all fucking day.

04:49.760 --> 04:53.200
The only thing I'm going to bring you is a book about cat ownership.

04:53.200 --> 04:57.920
Maybe that's why it's time for Beesbo to walk away from it. Fill a sack with books

04:57.920 --> 05:01.840
and then walk across the country hand delivering books to people

05:01.840 --> 05:04.240
while he thinks about his next big deal.

05:04.240 --> 05:07.440
Either that or maybe, because at this point, let's be honest, Amazon,

05:07.440 --> 05:12.080
you've got to have a whole giant warehouse just full of the books you forgot that you

05:12.080 --> 05:13.280
were supposed to sell.

05:13.280 --> 05:14.160
Absolutely.

05:14.160 --> 05:19.360
Maybe start hollowing those out and shipping people the things they ordered in books.

05:19.360 --> 05:22.080
Well, what do you think HQ2 is going to be made out of, Trav?

05:22.640 --> 05:23.920
Made out of books?

05:23.920 --> 05:31.920
No, the bones of employees that Jeff just kind of uses as, you know, dude sucks.

05:31.920 --> 05:34.640
Hey, can I tell you guys something horrible, though?

05:35.680 --> 05:36.240
What's that?

05:36.240 --> 05:40.960
Did you see the Al Roker thing from Thanksgiving?

05:41.600 --> 05:42.320
Yeah.

05:42.320 --> 05:42.560
No.

05:42.560 --> 05:44.720
Yeah, I saw a headline and I skipped it.

05:44.720 --> 05:49.200
Oh, you shouldn't have. You should have really patronized that click, bud,

05:49.200 --> 05:55.360
because this is a very, this is a good like meal time prep for me

05:55.360 --> 05:59.360
because Travis posted our mom's old sweet potato casserole recipe

05:59.360 --> 06:00.480
that I had not seen in a while.

06:00.480 --> 06:02.480
It's like my favorite dish that she made for Thanksgiving.

06:02.480 --> 06:03.360
I was so psyched.

06:03.360 --> 06:04.000
I made it.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.520
It was so ballin'.

06:05.520 --> 06:08.640
And so I sympathize with Mr. Roker,

06:08.640 --> 06:15.040
who on the Today Show presented his mom's sweet potato based Thanksgiving food recipe.

06:15.040 --> 06:20.960
It's kind of a casserole, but with chunks of pineapple and like a heaping handful

06:20.960 --> 06:25.600
of baking soda in it, which I'm still trying to wrap my mind around almost as far.

06:25.600 --> 06:30.320
And again, I do not, I'm not dunking on Mr. Roker or his mom or anything like that.

06:30.320 --> 06:31.120
I would never do that.

06:31.120 --> 06:32.160
I respect the game.

06:32.160 --> 06:37.520
The recipe he did say on television a few times was sweet potato poon.

06:39.520 --> 06:42.960
And Al Roker said it with his mouth on the television.

06:42.960 --> 06:47.520
And my ears, and I'm assuming lots of other people's ears heard the waves that he created

06:47.520 --> 06:49.920
and then were sort of digitally synthesized, sent over the airwaves

06:49.920 --> 06:52.640
and then into sweet potato poon.

06:52.640 --> 06:55.040
He really hit it, poon, and he hit it hard.

06:55.840 --> 06:57.760
Loud plosives, loud everything.

06:57.760 --> 07:00.480
So that was the highlight of my year.

07:02.560 --> 07:03.600
That sounds very good.

07:03.600 --> 07:06.080
Where were you, Justin, when you saw it on a website?

07:06.080 --> 07:07.280
You didn't even hear the word, did you?

07:08.000 --> 07:09.440
No, I saw dad.

07:09.440 --> 07:15.840
Al Roker popped up on TV and dad got really mad at him because he hates Al Roker now

07:15.840 --> 07:17.360
because he was mean to us that one time.

07:19.520 --> 07:20.400
I don't know how I feel now.

07:20.400 --> 07:24.640
I was mad at him and then the poon thing happened and now actually I think he gained a few points.

07:24.640 --> 07:25.840
Because how bold and brazen.

07:26.480 --> 07:28.960
I get that you're trying to share your mom's sweet potato casserole recipe.

07:28.960 --> 07:30.880
It's a beautiful instinct, right?

07:30.880 --> 07:35.840
But maybe have a talk with the producers, a frank talk with the producers.

07:35.840 --> 07:37.520
There was a fucking chyron that said sweet potato poon.

07:37.520 --> 07:39.120
Somebody designed it.

07:39.120 --> 07:41.040
Somebody sat down and said, you know what?

07:41.040 --> 07:44.960
I'm gonna put a lot of love into this sweet potato poon graphic.

07:45.760 --> 07:53.200
And even the Today Show Twitter account tweeted the video with the caption,

07:53.200 --> 07:57.920
what do our guest judges think of Al Roker's sweet potato poon?

07:57.920 --> 07:59.040
They love it.

07:59.040 --> 08:00.320
Yeah, and I don't like it being-

08:00.320 --> 08:02.320
We love Al Roker's poon.

08:02.320 --> 08:04.640
Yeah, I don't like it being possessive like that, huh?

08:05.520 --> 08:06.000
It's rough.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.800
The guest judges love Roker's poon.

08:08.800 --> 08:10.240
And now here we are saying it.

08:10.240 --> 08:13.680
And it's a word we would literally never say in any other context

08:13.680 --> 08:18.640
because it's arguably one of the worst ways to refer to genitalia.

08:18.640 --> 08:24.000
But I guess it's okay because it's actually referring to a marshmallow-y sweet potato treat.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.120
I don't know what's more offensive,

08:25.120 --> 08:29.440
the use of poon or the use of marshmallows on sweet potato.

08:29.440 --> 08:30.960
Yeah, we have feelings.

08:30.960 --> 08:32.800
Listen, we have some poonions.

08:32.800 --> 08:33.440
It's no big deal.

08:33.440 --> 08:35.120
Did you say a poonions?

08:35.120 --> 08:39.680
We have some poonions.

08:39.680 --> 08:40.320
It's the worst.

08:40.880 --> 08:42.320
So this is an advice show, okay?

08:43.120 --> 08:46.640
And what we do basically on this one is we just give you advice.

08:46.640 --> 08:48.000
You send us your questions and we turn them out,

08:48.000 --> 08:48.960
coming like into wisdom.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.200
The Christmas creep,

08:51.200 --> 08:53.200
I don't even think I need to tell you all is officially on.

08:54.560 --> 08:57.200
The candle nights for many of you have begun.

08:57.200 --> 09:01.040
We've been hearing about it starting to come in across the wires.

09:01.040 --> 09:02.640
So thank you for those updates.

09:02.640 --> 09:07.440
Candle nights, because I feel like we haven't discussed it in a little bit, wholesale.

09:07.440 --> 09:16.240
Candle nights is a pan-religious, pan-sexual, personal pan holiday for everyone.

09:17.840 --> 09:20.160
So it is our holiday.

09:20.160 --> 09:24.560
It is a, oh, probably the most important thing in this special time of year

09:24.560 --> 09:29.200
to remember about candle nights is that it is a registered trademark of Big Giant Head LLC.

09:29.200 --> 09:29.760
Correct.

09:29.760 --> 09:30.560
All rights reserved.

09:30.560 --> 09:34.480
And so that is the most important thing about helping candle lights grow

09:34.480 --> 09:38.240
is that it is our trademark that only we can use.

09:38.240 --> 09:39.920
Let's get that first question going.

09:39.920 --> 09:43.840
I work overnights at a facility with a washer and a dryer.

09:43.840 --> 09:45.360
Ooh, no need to brag.

09:46.080 --> 09:50.560
On certain nights, we have less to wash than others.

09:50.560 --> 09:52.640
Am I committing some sort of weird work crime

09:52.640 --> 09:54.960
if I were to throw my own laundry on slow days?

09:56.720 --> 09:58.400
It'd save me money at the laundromat,

09:58.400 --> 10:00.560
and I'd still use my own detergent.

10:00.560 --> 10:02.320
That's from Worried Washer in Washington.

10:03.040 --> 10:06.480
So, holy crap, this is confusing.

10:06.480 --> 10:08.960
They work at a facility with a washer and dryer.

10:08.960 --> 10:09.600
Correct.

10:09.600 --> 10:12.160
On certain nights, we have less wash to do than others.

10:12.720 --> 10:13.220
Yes.

10:13.920 --> 10:16.960
So they work in a facility, like say, like in a hotel

10:16.960 --> 10:19.360
where they're washing linens and sheets and stuff.

10:19.360 --> 10:20.480
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

10:21.280 --> 10:24.320
No, no, no, this is a binnie.

10:24.320 --> 10:26.080
This is a binnie of the job.

10:26.080 --> 10:27.600
It's embezzlement, Griffin.

10:27.600 --> 10:30.080
No, shush, shush.

10:30.080 --> 10:31.600
You can't embezzle that.

10:31.600 --> 10:32.800
This isn't embezzling.

10:33.440 --> 10:38.000
Listen, every job that you will ever have in your entire life

10:38.800 --> 10:43.920
is there's so much coyness that goes into the hiring process.

10:43.920 --> 10:46.160
They're gonna tell you salary.

10:46.160 --> 10:48.080
You can go back and forth, blow by blow,

10:48.080 --> 10:49.120
and try and raise that up.

10:49.120 --> 10:50.000
That's cool.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.320
They are gonna tell you their expectations,

10:52.320 --> 10:54.080
give you an idea like the schedule's gonna be,

10:54.080 --> 10:55.360
what training's gonna be like.

10:55.360 --> 10:57.120
And then they're gonna tell you, you know,

10:57.120 --> 11:00.160
if it's at a retail place, what kind of benefit you can get

11:00.160 --> 11:02.320
vis-a-vis a discount.

11:02.320 --> 11:04.000
But every job you'll ever have in your life

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
is gonna have these secret benefits

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
that they cannot put down on paper.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.520
This place cannot write down.

11:09.520 --> 11:13.040
And also, you can do your laundry here for free.

11:13.040 --> 11:14.880
Hush, hush, don't tell nobody.

11:14.880 --> 11:15.920
Yeah, don't ruin it.

11:15.920 --> 11:17.040
Don't ruin it for everyone.

11:17.040 --> 11:17.760
Yeah.

11:17.760 --> 11:19.600
Like at the GameStop that I worked at,

11:19.600 --> 11:23.680
the secret benefit there was that Nintendo DS games

11:23.680 --> 11:26.320
were just fair to steal.

11:26.320 --> 11:32.320
Because it was 2008, the DS had started a decline.

11:32.320 --> 11:34.080
3DS was just around the corner.

11:34.080 --> 11:36.720
And so I gave a knowing look to my manager.

11:36.720 --> 11:38.080
He looked back at me and nodded.

11:38.080 --> 11:41.920
And a nod that said, you go ahead and grab, you know,

11:41.920 --> 11:45.120
Zelda Phantom Hourglass there, tuck it right into your shoe,

11:45.120 --> 11:48.000
like a little bag of cocaine, and go on out of here.

11:48.000 --> 11:48.800
It's a benefit.

11:49.680 --> 11:52.480
When I worked at Best Buy, the added secret benefit

11:52.480 --> 11:56.320
was like, you can just like play Wii Bowling for hours

11:56.320 --> 11:58.960
and say you're working and demonstrating the game

11:58.960 --> 11:59.760
for people.

11:59.760 --> 12:00.640
A great benefit.

12:01.200 --> 12:03.280
Really, you're just really protect-

12:03.280 --> 12:07.360
Like, I was really perfecting my form at Best Buy,

12:07.360 --> 12:09.920
and that's why I'm a professional Wii Bowler now.

12:09.920 --> 12:10.480
Yeah.

12:10.480 --> 12:11.680
So thank you, Best Buy.

12:11.680 --> 12:13.200
At the blockbuster Justin worked at,

12:13.200 --> 12:14.720
it was you can steal one movie a month,

12:14.720 --> 12:16.000
just don't touch Fight Club.

12:16.000 --> 12:19.680
And then he took a big bite of that forbidden apple.

12:19.680 --> 12:21.440
He just couldn't resist.

12:21.440 --> 12:23.760
This is a penny.

12:23.760 --> 12:24.800
You're good.

12:24.800 --> 12:26.560
I'm not sure I agree with you guys.

12:26.560 --> 12:30.800
I hate to be the stickler, but I am not opposed-

12:30.800 --> 12:32.800
I don't think it's a problem to like use the washer

12:32.800 --> 12:33.760
and dryer stuff.

12:34.720 --> 12:39.920
What I do have a problem with is how do you like maintain,

12:39.920 --> 12:42.800
like do the work of laundry?

12:42.800 --> 12:44.240
Laundry doesn't do itself.

12:44.240 --> 12:46.480
Like once you throw those clothes in,

12:46.480 --> 12:47.840
maybe that's not a big deal,

12:47.840 --> 12:49.840
but you are gonna need to fold those.

12:49.840 --> 12:52.320
If you throw them in your trunk, unfolded,

12:52.880 --> 12:56.400
all you're gonna end up with is a big pile of wrinkly clothes,

12:56.400 --> 12:57.680
and nobody likes that.

12:57.680 --> 12:58.640
So are you gonna take-

12:59.840 --> 13:02.160
Is it not bad enough to take the boss man's detergent

13:02.160 --> 13:04.400
and water and now you're an electrician?

13:04.400 --> 13:07.280
They will use their own detergent, Justin.

13:07.280 --> 13:09.680
Okay, fine, but now you're using his time.

13:09.680 --> 13:14.640
That's company time, Dilbert, to fold your laundry.

13:14.640 --> 13:16.000
You couldn't have picked another name.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.120
Couldn't have picked another name.

13:17.120 --> 13:19.680
There was none other ones there right in there at that time.

13:21.040 --> 13:22.080
Yeah, I get what you're saying.

13:22.080 --> 13:23.280
How have we not-

13:23.280 --> 13:25.760
We have shaved so many of the edges off

13:26.320 --> 13:28.240
the laundry doing process, right?

13:28.240 --> 13:31.280
Like you go back and you look at the origins of laundry,

13:31.280 --> 13:32.560
and you know, you wash-

13:32.560 --> 13:34.320
It's my favorite Radiohead album, by the way.

13:34.320 --> 13:34.880
Yeah, it's great.

13:34.880 --> 13:36.400
You wash your clothes in the river,

13:36.400 --> 13:37.360
or you get the wash-

13:37.360 --> 13:41.600
The wash tub with a little thing that they play

13:41.600 --> 13:42.960
as a little cool instrument.

13:42.960 --> 13:43.840
A washboard.

13:43.840 --> 13:44.960
A washboard.

13:44.960 --> 13:46.720
And you know, we got that fixed.

13:46.720 --> 13:48.480
We got now a machine that gets the clothes wet,

13:48.480 --> 13:50.240
tumbles them around, gets them soapy,

13:50.240 --> 13:52.720
and another one that dries out the work of the first machine.

13:53.440 --> 13:54.880
And it's like we got that far,

13:54.880 --> 13:58.320
and we left the one big, very sharp, very deadly edge on it,

13:58.320 --> 14:02.240
which is now you have to do origami

14:02.240 --> 14:04.880
and sort and carry all of your heavy clothes.

14:04.880 --> 14:06.080
How have we not been able to like,

14:06.080 --> 14:09.520
then they, you know, are injected into a small pellet

14:09.520 --> 14:12.320
that you can then just like pull out of your drawer.

14:12.320 --> 14:15.360
It'll be labeled, Griffin's nice red shirt,

14:15.360 --> 14:17.040
and then you just spit on it,

14:17.040 --> 14:18.720
and the capsule disintegrates,

14:18.720 --> 14:20.400
and there's your shirt ready to go.

14:20.400 --> 14:21.680
Soaked in spit.

14:21.680 --> 14:22.400
No.

14:22.400 --> 14:22.880
Perfect.

14:22.880 --> 14:25.280
The capsule caught most of the spit.

14:25.280 --> 14:27.280
It will have some spit on it,

14:27.280 --> 14:28.880
but you didn't have to carry it like,

14:28.880 --> 14:29.600
you know, you just carry a box of pills.

14:29.600 --> 14:32.160
And then we'll need a fourth machine to wring out the spit.

14:33.280 --> 14:34.880
Listen, it's all I'm saying.

14:34.880 --> 14:36.160
Get my capsule machine going.

14:36.160 --> 14:37.040
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

14:37.600 --> 14:38.480
Yeah, I love that.

14:38.480 --> 14:39.920
Here's one sent in by Nick G.

14:39.920 --> 14:40.480
Thanks.

14:40.480 --> 14:43.440
It's a Yahoo Answers user, Ashley, who asks,

14:43.440 --> 14:48.240
is it possible to create a poem in your dreams?

14:48.240 --> 14:50.240
Huh.

14:50.240 --> 14:53.840
About two months ago, I had a dream about a book of poetry.

14:53.840 --> 14:55.280
I opened it and read a poem,

14:55.280 --> 14:58.240
and the theme was Where the Green Sky Meets the Blue Earth.

14:58.240 --> 15:02.480
I only actually read, I only actually read the first stanza,

15:02.480 --> 15:04.000
and the poem was amazing.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.960
I was so, I was so enveloped by the poem

15:06.960 --> 15:08.880
that I was actually sucked into the book

15:08.880 --> 15:10.640
and experienced the poem.

15:10.640 --> 15:11.440
Okay.

15:11.440 --> 15:12.880
I've certainly never read a poem

15:12.880 --> 15:14.080
and I've searched and searched,

15:14.080 --> 15:16.800
but I can't find a poem about a green sky and blue earth.

15:16.800 --> 15:18.160
I really didn't think it was possible

15:18.160 --> 15:19.680
to create literature in a dream,

15:19.680 --> 15:22.800
but now I'm not so sure I really want to find that poem.

15:22.800 --> 15:24.880
Is it possible to write a poem in a dream?

15:24.880 --> 15:26.480
If anyone can help me or at least point me

15:26.480 --> 15:28.080
in the right direction, that would be great.

15:29.040 --> 15:30.720
I dreamt a poem.

15:30.720 --> 15:36.480
I did, it seemed a little long and a little tough

15:36.480 --> 15:37.600
and I had, you know,

15:38.640 --> 15:41.360
some nude parts of the dream I wanted to get to.

15:41.360 --> 15:43.280
So I did only read the first stanza,

15:43.280 --> 15:44.480
but it was amazing.

15:44.480 --> 15:46.560
I was so enveloped by the first stanza,

15:46.560 --> 15:48.080
which was all I allowed myself to read

15:48.080 --> 15:49.040
because of how boring it was.

15:49.040 --> 15:50.080
I was sucked into the book

15:50.080 --> 15:52.800
and experienced this green sky and blue earth firsthand.

15:52.800 --> 15:53.520
Holy shit.

15:54.080 --> 15:56.640
Why is the sky green in this?

15:56.640 --> 15:58.640
It's a fucking dream poem, Travis.

15:58.640 --> 16:00.080
There are two answers to that, Travis.

16:00.080 --> 16:01.120
One, it's a poem.

16:01.120 --> 16:02.720
Two, it's a dream.

16:02.720 --> 16:04.640
Yeah, but even in a poem you're not like,

16:04.640 --> 16:06.800
look at that, I don't know, purple tree

16:06.800 --> 16:09.280
and it's like, oh, you're nailing it with this poem thing.

16:09.280 --> 16:12.720
You're like creating some very wild boundaries

16:12.720 --> 16:14.800
around what poems can have.

16:14.800 --> 16:16.320
Poems can do pretty much whatever,

16:16.320 --> 16:18.000
but if they get the color of the sky wrong,

16:18.000 --> 16:21.360
it's like, next, next poem, please.

16:21.360 --> 16:22.960
That's not about creating art

16:22.960 --> 16:26.560
and your beautiful, I don't know, rhymes or not rhymes.

16:26.560 --> 16:27.760
Come on, poems.

16:27.760 --> 16:29.040
Come on, not rhyming.

16:29.040 --> 16:30.960
Anybody can not rhyme things.

16:30.960 --> 16:34.160
But then you're also like making the sky green.

16:34.160 --> 16:35.040
What are you talking?

16:35.040 --> 16:36.080
And earth is brown.

16:37.840 --> 16:39.040
That's entirely possible.

16:39.040 --> 16:40.640
Do you remember when Travis was a copy editor

16:40.640 --> 16:41.760
for E.E. Comics?

16:41.760 --> 16:44.800
How many of his works he just, nope,

16:44.800 --> 16:46.160
sent back, no, no, no.

16:46.160 --> 16:47.520
Where's the punctuation?

16:47.520 --> 16:50.320
Listen, I think your typewriters got messed up keys in it

16:50.320 --> 16:52.560
or something because this is all fucked up, E.E.E.

16:52.560 --> 16:55.280
I just wrote back more commas across the top.

16:55.280 --> 16:56.640
More commas, one line.

16:56.640 --> 16:58.320
This is a sentence, E.E.E.

16:58.320 --> 16:59.520
You can do better than this.

16:59.520 --> 17:01.200
Gosh, I wish I knew other poets.

17:01.200 --> 17:02.020
I know.

17:02.020 --> 17:03.200
Man, there's gotta be other ones, right?

17:03.200 --> 17:04.560
I've been wondering about this lately.

17:04.560 --> 17:06.400
I am married to a poet

17:06.400 --> 17:07.680
and you would think at some point

17:07.680 --> 17:09.520
I would have learned like through osmosis

17:09.520 --> 17:12.400
or just from, you know, like just kissing.

17:12.400 --> 17:15.120
Like I would have absorbed some sort of like knowledge,

17:15.120 --> 17:16.640
but literally none.

17:16.640 --> 17:18.720
I feel like there's one named Yeats.

17:19.600 --> 17:22.400
There's one named Yeat for sure.

17:23.360 --> 17:23.860
Okay.

17:25.440 --> 17:27.200
My favorite one is Lord Byron

17:27.200 --> 17:28.480
because where does he get off?

17:28.480 --> 17:29.440
Yeah, that's pretty good.

17:31.200 --> 17:32.880
So did you dream, can you dream,

17:32.880 --> 17:39.120
hmm, did all of the George Lucas have a dream about Star Wars?

17:39.120 --> 17:40.160
Woke up, wrote it down.

17:40.160 --> 17:40.640
Not a poem.

17:40.640 --> 17:43.280
No, no, no, but Griffin, here's, I'm sorry,

17:43.280 --> 17:45.440
but what you are saying, yeah, of course,

17:45.440 --> 17:47.360
of course you can dream an idea.

17:47.360 --> 17:48.320
This is words.

17:48.320 --> 17:51.840
What this person is saying is that they dreamed

17:51.840 --> 17:55.280
about a poem that does exist already

17:55.280 --> 17:58.400
that they themselves have never read or seen.

17:58.960 --> 18:01.520
So they are trying to find the poem

18:01.520 --> 18:02.720
they dreamed about.

18:03.840 --> 18:06.400
Yeah, a very, very helpful user

18:06.400 --> 18:07.920
who like deserves a medal of honor

18:07.920 --> 18:11.360
for going above and beyond on Yahoo fucking answers

18:11.360 --> 18:14.800
named Evelyn says best answer,

18:14.800 --> 18:17.760
a rainbow by Donna Brock curving up,

18:17.760 --> 18:20.480
then down, meeting blue sky and green earth.

18:21.920 --> 18:25.200
Evelyn, it's clearly the opposite though.

18:25.200 --> 18:26.720
Green sky, blue earth.

18:26.720 --> 18:28.160
But Evelyn is correct.

18:28.160 --> 18:30.480
I appreciate your help, but you did, come on.

18:30.480 --> 18:31.200
Come on.

18:31.200 --> 18:33.920
Evelyn gets an A for accuracy.

18:34.560 --> 18:34.800
So.

18:35.920 --> 18:37.920
And a P for poem.

18:37.920 --> 18:40.080
And an R for rainbow.

18:40.080 --> 18:41.360
And an L for letters.

18:41.920 --> 18:42.720
There were many.

18:42.720 --> 18:43.680
She gets all of them.

18:46.000 --> 18:46.480
This would be-

18:46.480 --> 18:47.280
Is this a poem?

18:47.280 --> 18:48.880
Is this episode a poem?

18:48.880 --> 18:50.160
I mean, come on.

18:50.160 --> 18:51.280
What is in a poem?

18:51.280 --> 18:51.600
Fuck.

18:52.320 --> 18:54.160
I mean, lots of, most stuff isn't.

18:55.280 --> 18:56.800
Most stuff ain't poems.

18:56.800 --> 18:57.520
Most stuff ain't poems.

18:57.520 --> 18:58.480
What do you know?

18:58.480 --> 19:01.680
Okay, point to something right now and conclusively prove to me

19:01.680 --> 19:02.720
that it's not a poem.

19:03.360 --> 19:06.720
I mean, I guess anything can be a poem.

19:06.720 --> 19:12.000
And if that's your philosophy, then a 99

19:12.000 --> 19:15.360
and then like a funny number of.999s after it.

19:15.360 --> 19:16.960
Like I would go on for a long time and you'd be like,

19:16.960 --> 19:21.840
wow, that sure is a very small number of things are good poem.

19:21.840 --> 19:24.720
This episode, yeah, you could maybe write it down

19:24.720 --> 19:26.560
and then submit it to poetry class.

19:26.560 --> 19:28.640
You'll be expelled from the school for this.

19:28.640 --> 19:34.960
Or lauded as like the next poet laureate of the world.

19:34.960 --> 19:35.920
I do know this.

19:35.920 --> 19:36.640
I do know this.

19:37.680 --> 19:38.880
You have to be right.

19:38.880 --> 19:41.440
You have to be right in a poem to make a poem.

19:41.440 --> 19:46.080
And it is hard to do it.

19:46.080 --> 19:48.720
And I think saying out loud that anything's a poem.

19:48.720 --> 19:52.320
So fuck y'all is maybe a bad tact to take on Travie.

19:52.320 --> 19:56.800
I mean, we're looking down on Wayne's basement,

19:56.800 --> 19:58.640
only that's not Wayne's basement.

19:58.640 --> 19:59.840
Isn't that weird?

19:59.840 --> 20:02.960
And then Wayne says, Garth, that was a haiku.

20:03.520 --> 20:05.760
So he was not intending to write a poem,

20:05.760 --> 20:09.600
but he did write a poem with his phraseology.

20:09.600 --> 20:09.840
Sure.

20:09.840 --> 20:14.400
Or just went like Drew Barrymore in Die Dracula's like cellar door

20:14.400 --> 20:15.680
and everyone's like, oh god, it's fucking beautiful.

20:15.680 --> 20:17.280
So both those things you just mentioned

20:17.280 --> 20:20.560
were professional actors reading off a script

20:20.560 --> 20:22.480
that somebody had written.

20:22.480 --> 20:24.960
Somebody did write that haiku intentionally, Justin.

20:24.960 --> 20:25.760
So I'm going to come at you.

20:25.760 --> 20:29.440
And for Travis's example, didn't do a poem.

20:29.440 --> 20:32.560
I'm pretty sure she read a poem written by a poet at some point.

20:32.560 --> 20:36.800
Both of you guys are just, you fucking tanked so bad there

20:36.800 --> 20:38.640
on both of the points you're trying to make.

20:38.640 --> 20:39.280
Poems are hard.

20:39.280 --> 20:40.560
You got to try to make them.

20:40.560 --> 20:40.960
I don't think you-

20:40.960 --> 20:41.680
That's a poem.

20:41.680 --> 20:42.800
You just made a poem.

20:42.800 --> 20:43.440
Poems are hard.

20:43.440 --> 20:44.480
You got to try to make them.

20:44.480 --> 20:45.680
That could be a poem.

20:45.680 --> 20:46.720
Cut, print, rap.

20:47.680 --> 20:48.400
Griffin.

20:48.400 --> 20:49.120
Is it?

20:49.120 --> 20:50.800
Now, was it a rap?

20:50.800 --> 20:51.300
No.

20:52.160 --> 20:52.560
No.

20:52.560 --> 20:53.680
Are poems raps?

20:53.680 --> 20:54.480
Are raps poems?

20:54.480 --> 20:56.080
Some of them are, yeah.

20:56.080 --> 20:59.040
I don't know why I'm having to explain this to the two.

20:59.040 --> 21:03.280
It doesn't seem like the sort of taxonomy of these things

21:03.280 --> 21:04.240
is too difficult to understand.

21:04.240 --> 21:07.840
I feel like as someone who is married to an appreciator of poetry,

21:07.840 --> 21:11.280
you, Griffin, are wanting to put a lot of bounds

21:11.280 --> 21:13.600
on what is and ain't poems.

21:13.600 --> 21:16.480
And I think what Travis and I are saying is very empowering.

21:16.480 --> 21:16.720
Yes.

21:16.720 --> 21:19.840
Because what we're sort of saying is, who knows?

21:19.840 --> 21:20.560
Yeah, yeah, sure.

21:21.600 --> 21:23.200
I think this is a scenario, Griffin,

21:23.200 --> 21:24.960
where when this episode goes up,

21:24.960 --> 21:26.800
poets will actually be coming at you.

21:26.800 --> 21:27.360
Oh, okay.

21:27.360 --> 21:29.440
They're trying to limit their creativity,

21:29.440 --> 21:31.760
where I'm saying literally everything is a poem

21:31.760 --> 21:33.120
and anything could be a poem.

21:33.120 --> 21:35.680
And you're like, no, a poem's got to be like this.

21:37.680 --> 21:41.200
And you're like old man poet who's trying to box them in

21:41.200 --> 21:43.520
and I'm opening the door and setting them free.

21:43.520 --> 21:46.640
I feel like maybe I'm not putting boundaries on them

21:46.640 --> 21:48.960
because a poem can take so many forms.

21:49.680 --> 21:52.160
But what you all are saying, you're coming up and over me

21:52.160 --> 21:54.320
and saying that like fettuccine Alfredo,

21:54.320 --> 21:58.880
the dish of thick food, can be a poem.

21:58.880 --> 21:59.120
Yes.

21:59.760 --> 22:00.720
And I hate that.

22:00.720 --> 22:04.160
It smells stuff out with the noodles.

22:04.160 --> 22:04.480
Yeah, sure.

22:04.480 --> 22:06.720
Or maybe you do it in such a way that somebody eats it

22:06.720 --> 22:08.880
like you're fucking noodle poet, Derek.

22:08.880 --> 22:11.120
Yeah, the cream spills on the Olive Garden table

22:11.120 --> 22:12.400
and the sunlight shining through it

22:12.400 --> 22:14.560
makes a prism on the floor and you point out that

22:14.560 --> 22:16.480
and say, look, everyone, a poem.

22:16.480 --> 22:18.000
Look before it goes away.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.320
Yes, it's a pasta poem.

22:20.320 --> 22:21.520
All right, all right.

22:22.320 --> 22:25.440
I'm just saying that maybe as always,

22:25.440 --> 22:26.800
I'm right and you're wrong.

22:26.800 --> 22:28.160
I'm just saying what Travis,

22:28.160 --> 22:29.760
I think what Travis and I are saying is

22:31.600 --> 22:33.920
maybe poems are a collection of letters

22:33.920 --> 22:35.280
and spaces and persuasion.

22:35.840 --> 22:39.920
Maybe they're a collection of gluten and dairy products

22:39.920 --> 22:42.320
and peppercorns.

22:42.320 --> 22:42.880
You know what I mean?

22:42.880 --> 22:44.960
Like it could be whatever you-

22:44.960 --> 22:47.040
You're talking about discovered poems.

22:47.040 --> 22:49.440
I'm talking about undiscovered poems.

22:49.440 --> 22:52.080
Like I'm looking at the periodic table of poems

22:52.080 --> 22:53.840
and you're looking at the first two lines

22:53.840 --> 22:56.480
and I'm saying maybe there's even more squares

22:56.480 --> 22:59.200
and lines of poems that we haven't even discovered yet.

22:59.200 --> 23:01.120
Griffin is okay.

23:01.120 --> 23:03.760
Griffin didn't know about undiscovered poems.

23:03.760 --> 23:04.640
Yes, of course.

23:04.640 --> 23:06.400
A problem with a lot of poems.

23:06.400 --> 23:08.480
Let me clear this up for Griff and Travis

23:08.480 --> 23:09.520
before I might be so bold.

23:09.520 --> 23:10.000
Please do.

23:10.000 --> 23:11.440
Yeah, I'm obviously having some trouble here.

23:11.440 --> 23:14.320
The problem with a lot of poems

23:14.320 --> 23:16.880
is that people haven't realized that they're poems yet.

23:16.880 --> 23:17.680
Correct.

23:17.680 --> 23:18.720
So the hard work,

23:19.520 --> 23:21.040
a lot of people write poems

23:21.040 --> 23:22.880
and it's almost like wasteful

23:23.680 --> 23:27.760
because there's lots of poems out there already

23:27.760 --> 23:30.320
that we just haven't sort of unearthed yet.

23:30.320 --> 23:30.960
You know what I mean?

23:30.960 --> 23:31.760
That are just waiting to be discovered.

23:31.760 --> 23:32.160
That's true.

23:33.280 --> 23:35.680
I guess it's not like anybody's ever kicked in the door

23:35.680 --> 23:37.120
to plowshares and said,

23:37.120 --> 23:39.600
hey, here's a Pettuccini Alfredo,

23:39.600 --> 23:41.280
print this you fucking cowards.

23:43.200 --> 23:44.480
Yeah, I think that's fair.

23:45.920 --> 23:47.680
Now what a lot of people are wondering

23:47.680 --> 23:49.360
is what's plowshares?

23:49.360 --> 23:49.920
Yeah, it's a...

23:51.760 --> 23:52.640
You know what?

23:52.640 --> 23:54.160
I don't think that's as important

23:54.160 --> 23:57.200
as the fact that Pettuccini Alfredo can be a poem.

23:57.200 --> 23:59.600
Did you just say Pettuccini Alfredo?

23:59.600 --> 24:04.320
Yeah, how would plowshares, a literary journal,

24:04.320 --> 24:08.400
how would they go about printing Pettuccini Alfredo?

24:08.400 --> 24:11.200
They squeeze it between the pages of the book, Griffin.

24:11.200 --> 24:12.080
Each one, okay.

24:12.080 --> 24:13.600
Like pressing a flower.

24:13.600 --> 24:15.120
I thought maybe you upended on the Xerox,

24:15.120 --> 24:16.640
whatever shape it takes is the poem.

24:16.640 --> 24:17.760
Oh, maybe that.

24:17.760 --> 24:18.480
Oh, I like that.

24:18.480 --> 24:20.480
No, that sounds more like of a McSweeney's thing.

24:20.480 --> 24:22.640
Griffin, you're kind of getting the hang of it now.

24:22.640 --> 24:24.240
Yeah, I'm proud of you.

24:24.880 --> 24:26.320
You're a poet now, boy.

24:26.320 --> 24:27.680
When did you start plowshares?

24:28.320 --> 24:29.600
I didn't even know about it.

24:29.600 --> 24:34.560
Yeah, I was doing a weed in the 70s

24:34.560 --> 24:38.400
and eating the most delicious bowl of,

24:38.400 --> 24:40.880
not Pettuccini Alfredo, but in that family,

24:40.880 --> 24:42.640
sort of a carbonara situation.

24:42.640 --> 24:44.960
And I let out a hearty burp.

24:44.960 --> 24:47.040
My friend Tim said, that's a poem.

24:47.040 --> 24:48.960
And so the rest is history, baby.

24:48.960 --> 24:50.400
Burp into this book, quick.

24:50.400 --> 24:51.520
Yeah, I burped into the book.

24:51.520 --> 24:52.800
I burped all my secrets into it.

24:52.800 --> 24:55.120
Tim said, that's a poem, quick, slam the book.

24:55.120 --> 24:57.760
Slam the book shut before the burp poem gets away.

24:57.760 --> 25:00.720
And so that was how that worked.

25:00.720 --> 25:02.880
And there are people who are never gonna listen

25:02.880 --> 25:04.960
to our show again because of this bit.

25:04.960 --> 25:08.160
Because they're too afraid of how truthful it is?

25:08.160 --> 25:10.480
Like, maybe this episode's a poem?

25:10.480 --> 25:11.760
I've been doing this for a long time now

25:11.760 --> 25:12.800
that I can sense these things.

25:13.360 --> 25:18.160
I feel like there are some people that have gone beyond mad

25:18.160 --> 25:24.960
and found emotions that are somehow beyond mad,

25:24.960 --> 25:27.920
which hopefully will be useful to them in their poetry.

25:29.280 --> 25:32.320
I've never thought of our podcast as us being the Cenobites

25:32.320 --> 25:33.840
from the Hellraiser movies,

25:33.840 --> 25:36.880
just like trying to make you experience new sort of,

25:36.880 --> 25:41.600
by subjecting you to new sort of torturous body horrors

25:41.600 --> 25:44.160
by desecrating the things that you're passionate about.

25:44.160 --> 25:47.600
You can find new, you can transcend the base emotions

25:47.600 --> 25:48.800
into something more beautiful

25:48.800 --> 25:50.480
that you can then turn into poetry, yes.

25:50.480 --> 25:51.200
Yes.

25:51.200 --> 25:52.960
I'm only passionate about one thing.

25:52.960 --> 25:53.920
Do y'all know what it is?

25:53.920 --> 25:55.440
Money?

25:55.440 --> 25:56.000
Money zone?

25:56.000 --> 25:56.480
Money.

25:56.480 --> 25:57.120
Yeah, it's money.

25:57.120 --> 25:57.600
It's money.

25:57.600 --> 25:58.240
It's the one thing.

26:09.280 --> 26:11.280
This is the year that you can finally tackle

26:11.280 --> 26:12.640
your holiday shopping early.

26:13.200 --> 26:14.160
Guess what?

26:14.160 --> 26:16.960
You can just get everybody underpants and stuff.

26:17.600 --> 26:18.100
Okay.

26:18.640 --> 26:18.960
Yeah.

26:18.960 --> 26:19.920
Well, no, there's a reason

26:19.920 --> 26:21.920
because we're sponsored this week by MeUndies

26:21.920 --> 26:25.360
and MeUndies uses the coveted micromodal fabric,

26:25.360 --> 26:26.960
which is three times softer than cotton.

26:26.960 --> 26:29.920
And let me tell y'all, if you like their underpants,

26:29.920 --> 26:32.240
you're gonna love their lounge pants.

26:32.240 --> 26:32.880
Yeah.

26:32.880 --> 26:34.480
I was wearing the lounge pants yesterday.

26:34.480 --> 26:39.120
My little baby boy grabbed like the cuff of the pant leg

26:39.120 --> 26:40.480
down at the bottom near my foot

26:40.480 --> 26:42.880
and just started playing with the micromodal fabric.

26:42.880 --> 26:44.640
Just kind of stretching it and playing with it

26:44.640 --> 26:45.760
and having a great time.

26:45.760 --> 26:46.640
Great for kids.

26:46.640 --> 26:47.840
Folks, let me tell you,

26:47.840 --> 26:50.400
these aren't pants to wear all the time.

26:50.400 --> 26:54.160
If you have things to do, don't put these pants on.

26:54.160 --> 26:54.720
Yes.

26:54.720 --> 26:56.320
This is not work and wear, folks.

26:56.320 --> 26:57.600
You're gonna put these on and be like,

26:57.600 --> 27:00.640
I'm just gonna stretch out here on the couch and do Tuesday.

27:01.200 --> 27:01.920
What?

27:01.920 --> 27:05.520
I got fired from my job because you're so darn comfortable.

27:05.520 --> 27:06.480
And here's the thing,

27:06.480 --> 27:09.440
you can choose from four different cuts of underpants,

27:10.480 --> 27:12.240
all of which are available from classic colors

27:12.240 --> 27:13.360
to adventurous prints.

27:14.160 --> 27:16.400
And the lounge pants, they come,

27:16.400 --> 27:19.520
the ones I have are in this very fun black and red,

27:19.520 --> 27:23.200
like kind of very seasonal prints

27:23.200 --> 27:24.960
that I really enjoy, like a plaid.

27:24.960 --> 27:25.840
Mine are green and black.

27:26.640 --> 27:27.360
Ooh, really?

27:27.360 --> 27:28.080
It's fun.

27:28.080 --> 27:28.880
Yeah, they're different.

27:30.240 --> 27:31.440
And speaking of prints,

27:31.440 --> 27:34.400
they'll be releasing a new print every Tuesday.

27:35.440 --> 27:38.160
Speaking of prints, Raspberry Beret, killer tracks.

27:38.160 --> 27:38.560
So sick.

27:39.760 --> 27:41.600
And along with lounge pants, they got onesies,

27:41.600 --> 27:43.360
they got hoodies, they got t-shirts.

27:43.360 --> 27:46.480
I have a meandee t-shirt that is like one of my favorite.

27:47.280 --> 27:48.880
Because it feels like a hug.

27:48.880 --> 27:49.920
I've been wearing their hoodie

27:49.920 --> 27:51.520
since the weather changed here in Austin.

27:51.520 --> 27:52.960
It's been nice, nice friend.

28:28.000 --> 28:29.440

29:48.880 --> 29:50.160
salutations.

29:50.160 --> 29:52.880
I'm sure you're wondering why I've gathered you all here today.

29:52.880 --> 29:55.040
It is important that I tell you that I am Nico

29:55.040 --> 29:56.320
and you are all my friends.

29:56.320 --> 29:59.120
The important ones clearly because you listen to this show.

29:59.120 --> 30:01.680
Zoe, one day I will get you to stop committing food crimes.

30:01.680 --> 30:04.800
The rest of you, it's 420 somewhere so please 420 blaze it.

30:04.800 --> 30:08.080
For me, Jumbotron adjourned.

30:08.080 --> 30:09.120
I love that.

30:09.120 --> 30:09.680
I love that.

30:09.680 --> 30:11.920
A lot of times we get letters and people say

30:11.920 --> 30:14.160
I don't know when to stop listening to the Jumbotron

30:14.160 --> 30:17.520
and this one had a little like, you know, over and out on it.

30:17.520 --> 30:19.440
Which I think that Jumbotron was a poem.

30:20.480 --> 30:21.600
How about this next one then?

30:21.600 --> 30:22.560
Let's see about that.

30:22.560 --> 30:22.880
Okay.

30:23.600 --> 30:25.680
I'll read it I guess because nobody else is doing it.

30:25.680 --> 30:27.200
This is you introed it.

30:27.200 --> 30:28.960
It's for Perry Buto.

30:29.520 --> 30:30.640
Sorry if I fucked that up.

30:30.640 --> 30:34.240
It's from Michaela Johnson Blanchard or Blanchard

30:34.240 --> 30:36.800
who says hey specialty pizza.

30:36.800 --> 30:39.440
I purchased this message to commemorate how far we've come

30:39.440 --> 30:42.240
since our days listening to my bim bam and knitting on your bed.

30:42.880 --> 30:45.280
We don't like that show anymore obviously.

30:45.920 --> 30:47.360
We've come way past it.

30:47.360 --> 30:48.960
It's really grown.

30:48.960 --> 30:52.400
We've grown and evolved and it's for we've put away our childish things now.

30:53.440 --> 30:55.200
You're almost done with your master's

30:55.200 --> 30:58.800
and I'm finishing up my first quarter of grad school plus getting married.

30:58.800 --> 31:01.280
I am thrilled that you continue to be an important person in my life

31:01.280 --> 31:04.560
and I hope hearing some love from these boys brightens your day.

31:04.560 --> 31:06.320
Looking forward to our next adventure.

31:06.880 --> 31:07.680
It's a sweet message.

31:07.680 --> 31:08.800
Sometimes we get stuff like this

31:08.800 --> 31:11.680
and I worry that we aren't rubbing enough love into it.

31:11.680 --> 31:12.800
We're just sort of reading.

31:12.800 --> 31:16.960
So like I guess Perry we love you.

31:17.520 --> 31:18.080
We love you.

31:20.800 --> 31:23.280
Hi I'm the JV Club podcast Janet Varney

31:23.280 --> 31:25.680
and I used to suffer from indecision.

31:25.680 --> 31:29.040
I couldn't choose between Star Wars and Star Trek

31:29.040 --> 31:32.960
whether to call or text or the best way to cook my eggs

31:32.960 --> 31:36.080
but now thanks to my weekly dose of We Got This on Maximum Fun

31:36.080 --> 31:37.680
my decisions are made for me.

31:37.680 --> 31:38.880
Thanks Mark and Hal.

31:39.520 --> 31:41.040
Warning, We Got This may cause shouting,

31:41.040 --> 31:43.040
foam throwing, the illusion that the hosts can hear you,

31:43.040 --> 31:44.560
laughter on public transit, and death.

31:45.280 --> 31:46.640
We Got This with Mark and Hal.

31:46.640 --> 31:47.520
We know what's best.

31:52.720 --> 31:54.480
How about a next question?

31:54.480 --> 31:58.320
Before we do that I have a special segment I'd like to introduce to you now.

31:58.320 --> 31:59.200
It's a new segment.

32:00.480 --> 32:03.200
It's a new festive segment.

32:05.280 --> 32:06.480
There's a jingle I wrote for it

32:06.480 --> 32:08.400
if I could just sing the jingle real quick.

32:08.400 --> 32:08.720
Okay.

32:08.720 --> 32:09.280
Of course.

32:09.280 --> 32:09.780
Okay.

32:10.800 --> 32:14.080
Come and sit with me now in the candlelight.

32:16.480 --> 32:19.280
Yeah this Christmas we're gonna do right.

32:21.920 --> 32:24.160
Hang some lights on the tree.

32:24.160 --> 32:27.360
Yeah that's a Christmas to me.

32:28.800 --> 32:31.360
Put your arm around the fire.

32:34.080 --> 32:37.760
Yeah I don't want any more knock.

32:39.280 --> 32:42.240
Yeah you're calling me a liar.

32:43.440 --> 32:46.560
But I'm gonna go out for a jog.

32:47.600 --> 32:50.560
That's a Christmas to me.

32:50.560 --> 32:53.840
That's a Christmas to me.

32:53.840 --> 32:56.080
You and me and her and a tree.

32:58.560 --> 33:00.480
Learning about birds and the bee.

33:03.520 --> 33:05.680
That's a Christmas to me.

33:06.960 --> 33:08.880
So this is my new segment.

33:08.880 --> 33:09.920
That's a Christmas to me.

33:10.560 --> 33:18.960
And it's a segment where I'm gonna read you three descriptions from Hallmark Christmas films

33:18.960 --> 33:29.280
Two of them are going to be real films and one of them is going to be a film that I've engineered.

33:29.280 --> 33:34.320
These are challenging questions that I don't want anybody to leap to snap decisions to.

33:34.320 --> 33:36.640
I want you to really chew these over okay.

33:37.280 --> 33:39.200
We have three films today.

33:39.200 --> 33:40.880
The first film is called Let It Snow.

33:42.000 --> 33:46.720
When Falcon Resorts acquires family-owned Snow Valley Lodge from retiring owners

33:46.720 --> 33:51.920
Carla and Paul, driven executive Stephanie Beck must spend the week before Christmas

33:51.920 --> 33:55.520
in Maine preparing a proposal on the property's renovations.

33:55.520 --> 33:59.520
Determined to impress Falcon's president, her detached father Ted,

33:59.520 --> 34:04.480
Stephanie reluctantly departs her warm Arizona home to immerse herself in the lodge's property

34:04.480 --> 34:08.960
and decide how to change it to fit the hip young Falcon brand.

34:08.960 --> 34:12.720
While preparing to rebuild the Snow Valley Lodge from the ground up,

34:12.720 --> 34:17.840
Stephanie butts heads with her property guide Brady Lewis, Carla and Paul's son,

34:17.840 --> 34:22.720
who has decided to leave his family's business over creative differences with his dad.

34:24.160 --> 34:31.280
A self-defined grinch, Stephanie begins her stay at Snow Valley Lodge immune to Christmas sentiment.

34:31.280 --> 34:36.560
But as the lodge's festive traditions provide, the Christmas Stephanie never had growing up

34:36.560 --> 34:40.640
with her distant father, Stephanie finds herself enjoying every minute.

34:40.640 --> 34:42.960
To complicate her professional duties even further,

34:42.960 --> 34:46.640
the combative feelings she felt towards Brady turned into romantic ones.

34:46.640 --> 34:51.840
With Stephanie's newfound Christmas spirit and unexpected holiday romance,

34:51.840 --> 34:54.800
she begins to question Falcon's overhaul.

34:54.800 --> 34:58.400
As her Christmas Eve deadline approaches, she's faced with a decision.

34:59.120 --> 35:05.440
She transform the lodge into a new winter hotspot or embrace tradition and let it snow.

35:05.440 --> 35:07.440
Oh, the latter one because it's the name of the movie.

35:08.080 --> 35:10.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

35:10.000 --> 35:11.760
That's our first film. It's called Let It Snow.

35:12.720 --> 35:14.720
I want to get through our other two films.

35:14.720 --> 35:17.440
Their descriptions are slightly shorter, mercifully.

35:18.320 --> 35:22.960
These descriptions, by the way, are direct from the Hallmark Company's website.

35:22.960 --> 35:25.360
Yeah, but I didn't think you wrote these for the shows.

35:25.360 --> 35:26.080
Okay, thank you.

35:28.560 --> 35:30.640
This one's called Cast Away for Christmas.

35:30.640 --> 35:34.880
When San Francisco- When they sit down to watch the Tom Hanks movie,

35:34.880 --> 35:38.480
Cast Away. When you watch it and watch the whole thing, it's awesome.

35:39.440 --> 35:41.040
Cast Away for Christmas.

35:41.040 --> 35:43.520
When San Francisco oil executive Nick Sperling

35:43.520 --> 35:46.880
comes to the remote Canadian hamlet of Cedarwood Island,

35:46.880 --> 35:49.040
he's only looking for one thing.

35:49.040 --> 35:54.400
The rumored oil deposit under Cedarwood's only tree farm slash bed and breakfast.

35:54.400 --> 35:58.480
In the hopes of endearing himself to its owner, single mob Lisa Craig,

35:58.480 --> 36:02.240
Nick pretends to be a bed and breakfast critic

36:02.240 --> 36:04.880
looking for Canada's most charming holiday escape.

36:06.080 --> 36:08.400
When a snowstorm shuts down ferry service off the island,

36:08.400 --> 36:12.880
Nick finds himself stranded on what the natives jokingly call Christmas Island

36:12.880 --> 36:15.360
in honor of how the town goes all out for the holiday.

36:15.360 --> 36:19.120
Before long, Nick starts to doubt his plans to raise the farm in search of oil

36:19.120 --> 36:22.080
and starts to wonder if he could make a life with Lisa.

36:22.080 --> 36:26.320
But after she learns the truth, will she ever want to see him again?

36:26.320 --> 36:27.680
Is the truth that he's a ghost?

36:27.680 --> 36:29.600
No, the truth is that he's an oil executive.

36:29.600 --> 36:30.560
He pretended to be anyway.

36:30.560 --> 36:31.280
Oh, right, right, right.

36:31.280 --> 36:35.360
Okay, last film, Christmas in Love.

36:36.480 --> 36:36.720
Good.

36:36.720 --> 36:38.400
I can't believe one of these isn't real.

36:38.400 --> 36:39.840
I haven't even heard what this is.

36:39.840 --> 36:43.680
Ellie Hartman is an aspiring crafter working in her small town's bakery

36:43.680 --> 36:46.160
making famous Christmas kringles.

36:46.160 --> 36:52.080
When the new big city CEO Nick Carlingson visits the bakery,

36:52.080 --> 36:56.000
he arrives filled with modernization ideas destined to lay off many employees.

36:56.000 --> 37:00.080
During his visit, Ellie is to teach Nick how to make a kringle

37:00.080 --> 37:05.680
and determined to show him it's the people who make the business success, not machines.

37:05.680 --> 37:07.760
Nick meets more of the employees and townspeople,

37:07.760 --> 37:11.280
visits the food bank and begins to see all the kindness that is shared

37:11.280 --> 37:12.800
and he begins to soften.

37:12.800 --> 37:15.360
They're not convinced automation isn't better.

37:15.360 --> 37:20.400
Struggling with chasing her own entrepreneurial dreams, Ellie begins to fall for Nick

37:20.400 --> 37:23.920
but not before feeling betrayed when she inadvertently sees Nick's laptop

37:23.920 --> 37:25.600
filled with automation plans.

37:25.600 --> 37:29.360
When Nick finally tells the employees his future ideas for the company,

37:29.360 --> 37:32.400
Ellie must decide if she should trust him but more importantly,

37:32.400 --> 37:35.840
whether to take a leap of faith in making her own dreams come true

37:35.840 --> 37:38.080
and that's Christmas in Love.

37:38.080 --> 37:41.600
The three films again are Let It Snow

37:42.400 --> 37:47.840
and that's about the woman who goes to the resort to find out how they do Christmas.

37:47.840 --> 37:48.320
Change it.

37:48.320 --> 37:50.640
Change it and knock it down.

37:50.640 --> 37:52.720
Castaway for Christmas is about an oil executive

37:52.720 --> 37:57.760
that goes to a Christmas island to not probably knock down the tree farm

37:57.760 --> 38:00.640
in order to build his oil thing

38:00.640 --> 38:05.840
and Christmas in Love is about a guy who's gonna go destroy the bakery

38:05.840 --> 38:07.600
to replace it with robots.

38:07.600 --> 38:10.560
That one has a Blade Runner vibe that I'm super into by the way.

38:10.560 --> 38:13.120
I do want to ask you because I am not as familiar

38:13.120 --> 38:15.440
with like the Hallmark Netflix original.

38:16.560 --> 38:18.800
Channel 312 Trav on DirecTV.

38:18.800 --> 38:19.280
Get there.

38:19.280 --> 38:20.080
Thank you.

38:20.080 --> 38:25.440
But is it just, did you specifically pick these three movies for the theme

38:25.440 --> 38:27.680
or is it just a super common theme of like,

38:28.320 --> 38:32.080
person comes to town to destroy a small business.

38:32.080 --> 38:34.000
Oh no, love saved the business.

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
This is Netflix's Christmas Inheritance too.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.240
It's just, it feels like some, what was the first,

38:38.240 --> 38:42.000
what was the urr movie for these that was just sort of then passed down

38:42.000 --> 38:44.560
through a game of telephone and became all,

38:44.560 --> 38:45.200
and you know what?

38:45.200 --> 38:48.640
I'm talking about this just in completely ignoring the fact that one of these is fake.

38:48.640 --> 38:50.320
One of these is, you wrote.

38:50.320 --> 38:51.520
And I have to say kudos.

38:51.520 --> 38:52.160
Thank you.

38:52.160 --> 38:52.880
Kudos, yes.

38:52.880 --> 38:54.160
It's a very realistic.

38:54.160 --> 38:57.760
I have to give half the credit to Sydney who helped me.

38:57.760 --> 39:02.240
By the way, we cooked up our film in 10 minutes

39:02.240 --> 39:06.000
while she folded laundry and I kept the baby from killing herself.

39:06.000 --> 39:07.040
So it's like-

39:07.040 --> 39:08.080
Not the hardest.

39:08.080 --> 39:09.040
It's not the hardest.

39:09.920 --> 39:15.200
Anything can be a urban person goes rural romantic Christmas.

39:15.200 --> 39:18.640
Be careful- Learns that people are maybe worth those shits.

39:18.640 --> 39:22.560
Yeah, yeah, there's, I think that that's definitely,

39:22.560 --> 39:25.920
Travis, you stumble on one of the common themes in Hallmark Christmas movies.

39:25.920 --> 39:32.960
The three big ones I would say are big city person who fucking doesn't,

39:32.960 --> 39:36.400
has never heard of Christmas, never had it, somehow missed it,

39:36.960 --> 39:39.200
and then goes to one small town where they're like,

39:39.200 --> 39:41.040
yeah, we got Christmas coming out of our ass.

39:41.040 --> 39:42.720
Here, have a little bit extra Christmas.

39:42.720 --> 39:44.320
The second theme is white.

39:44.320 --> 39:50.880
The third theme is like automation and preservation of business

39:51.440 --> 39:59.120
in favor of like a profit versus keeping jobs and tradition.

39:59.120 --> 40:00.240
So literally saying like,

40:01.120 --> 40:06.160
this is more important than the money we would need to pay people who work here.

40:07.360 --> 40:07.680
Yeah.

40:07.680 --> 40:09.120
The people are what matters.

40:09.760 --> 40:11.680
I'm so worried about giving away anything.

40:11.680 --> 40:12.480
I know, I know, I know.

40:12.480 --> 40:14.480
I really hope Christmas in Love is not the fake one

40:14.480 --> 40:17.840
because I feel like Jeff Bezos could really love to watch that one.

40:17.840 --> 40:20.000
I have to say it's Christmas in Love too.

40:20.000 --> 40:20.560
You do?

40:20.560 --> 40:22.320
Well, wait, no, I'm not saying that one's fake.

40:22.320 --> 40:24.160
No, I'm saying I don't want that to be fake.

40:24.160 --> 40:27.200
I think Cast Away for Christmas is for sure the fake one.

40:27.200 --> 40:28.640
I think it's Christmas in Love.

40:29.680 --> 40:30.080
Justin?

40:30.800 --> 40:32.000
So what are our votes?

40:32.000 --> 40:33.040
Sorry, one more time.

40:33.040 --> 40:34.240
I'm Cast Away for Christmas.

40:34.240 --> 40:36.000
Travis is Christmas in Love.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.240
Christmas in Love is the one with the kringles, right?

40:38.240 --> 40:38.880
Yeah.

40:38.880 --> 40:40.480
Okay, then that's what I'm going with.

40:41.040 --> 40:42.160
As the fake one?

40:42.160 --> 40:42.800
Yes.

40:42.800 --> 40:47.840
All right, the winner of this round of That's a Christmas to Me

40:48.480 --> 40:50.320
is Griffin McElroy.

40:50.320 --> 40:52.960
Cast Away for Christmas is a fake film

40:52.960 --> 40:55.520
that my wife and I came up with at 2.45 today

40:55.520 --> 40:56.240
before we started recording.

40:56.240 --> 40:58.080
Holy shit.

40:58.080 --> 40:59.360
Thank you very much.

40:59.360 --> 40:59.920
It was good.

41:00.640 --> 41:02.640
I'm not saying it was fake because you gave yourself away.

41:02.640 --> 41:03.520
It just seemed like-

41:03.520 --> 41:04.640
You had to pick one.

41:04.640 --> 41:06.880
I had to pick one and it seemed like the oil was maybe-

41:06.880 --> 41:09.040
The one with kringles was real?

41:09.040 --> 41:10.160
Here's the wildest thing.

41:10.160 --> 41:12.240
If I may divert about Christmas in Love real quick.

41:12.240 --> 41:16.160
So the CEO of the bakery company comes

41:16.720 --> 41:20.240
and he's the son of the current CEO

41:20.240 --> 41:22.160
and he's going to be the new CEO, right?

41:22.160 --> 41:23.920
He comes to the bakery company.

41:23.920 --> 41:25.840
This is where they bake all the things

41:25.840 --> 41:28.160
and he's from the home base in San Francisco.

41:28.960 --> 41:30.720
He is the son of the owner, okay?

41:31.360 --> 41:35.200
He shows up in this town of like where everybody loves Christmas

41:35.200 --> 41:36.640
and this woman bakes Christmas kringles,

41:37.280 --> 41:38.400
shows up in the town

41:38.400 --> 41:44.160
and pretends he's not, just pretends he's not that

41:44.160 --> 41:45.600
because in all these films,

41:45.600 --> 41:47.760
the one thing that's very important is deceit.

41:47.760 --> 41:49.920
There's always deceit in these films.

41:49.920 --> 41:51.520
It's extremely important.

41:51.520 --> 41:54.240
This woman doesn't know what the son of the owner

41:54.240 --> 41:55.840
of her company looks like.

41:55.840 --> 41:57.440
She allows herself to be lied to

41:57.440 --> 41:59.760
for the entirety of the film about his identity.

41:59.760 --> 42:02.560
It is, it says absolute madness.

42:02.560 --> 42:05.120
I am not as much of a business expert

42:05.120 --> 42:06.800
as I am a poetry expert.

42:06.800 --> 42:11.680
Is it common for a headquarters

42:11.680 --> 42:15.200
of what sounds to me like a single bakery-

42:15.200 --> 42:16.000
Yes, yes, yes.

42:16.000 --> 42:19.840
To be not in the same place as where the bakery is?

42:20.400 --> 42:23.760
I'm going to set up my office thousands of miles away

42:23.760 --> 42:27.120
from the only building that matters to my company?

42:27.120 --> 42:27.680
Yes.

42:27.680 --> 42:30.480
Yes, listen, we need to give thanks to Netflix

42:30.480 --> 42:32.080
for making bold films like A Christmas Prince

42:32.080 --> 42:33.360
that break the fucking mold.

42:33.360 --> 42:35.520
Like fucking Christmas Chronicles,

42:35.520 --> 42:38.160
which is about a Santa who does fuck for sure.

42:38.160 --> 42:39.520
Excited to watch that.

42:39.520 --> 42:42.240
I haven't watched Christmas Chronicles yet,

42:42.240 --> 42:47.440
but it is on my 40 Christmas movie to-do list.

42:47.440 --> 42:47.840
Yeah.

42:47.840 --> 42:50.640
Still looking for 10 more suggestions, by the way.

42:50.640 --> 42:51.680
Can we do a Yahoo?

42:51.680 --> 42:52.000
Yeah.

42:52.000 --> 42:54.480
We've only answered one regular question this episode.

42:54.480 --> 42:55.520
Maybe we should do that first.

42:56.080 --> 42:56.960
You got it.

42:56.960 --> 42:59.840
I recently discovered that my landlord has a secret toilet

42:59.840 --> 43:01.280
hidden in my basement.

43:01.280 --> 43:03.360
I live in a house with an unfinished basement

43:03.360 --> 43:04.400
and there's a door down there

43:04.400 --> 43:05.680
that the landlord keeps locked

43:05.680 --> 43:07.200
and has told us is off limits.

43:07.840 --> 43:09.200
One day when I was in the basement,

43:09.200 --> 43:10.320
I noticed the door was unlocked.

43:10.320 --> 43:11.440
So of course I took a peek.

43:12.080 --> 43:15.280
Inside was a toilet and a half-used roll of toilet paper.

43:15.840 --> 43:17.680
I'm really not sure how to proceed from here.

43:17.680 --> 43:18.240
Call the cops.

43:20.480 --> 43:23.920
Does he come to my house just to poop in my basement?

43:23.920 --> 43:24.560
Yes.

43:24.560 --> 43:25.680
What do I do?

43:25.680 --> 43:27.200
I announce we're doing laundry

43:27.200 --> 43:28.960
and suddenly I hear it flush

43:28.960 --> 43:31.680
and he comes out of his secret bathroom.

43:31.680 --> 43:32.800
Should I be afraid?

43:32.800 --> 43:35.360
Should I tell him I've discovered his dirty little secret?

43:35.360 --> 43:36.320
Please help.

43:36.320 --> 43:38.080
That's from Bathroom Shy in Michigan.

43:38.880 --> 43:40.000
You can't tell him.

43:40.800 --> 43:41.840
He'll silence you.

43:42.640 --> 43:43.360
Yep.

43:43.360 --> 43:43.600
Yeah.

43:43.600 --> 43:46.080
If I had a toilet somewhere in the world

43:46.080 --> 43:47.920
that only I knew about,

43:47.920 --> 43:50.160
I would protect that with my life.

43:50.160 --> 43:51.840
Yeah, he will put you in the ground.

43:51.840 --> 43:52.320
No question.

43:52.320 --> 43:52.880
Holy shit.

43:52.880 --> 43:54.160
Have you guys ever thought about this?

43:55.120 --> 43:55.600
Just now.

43:55.600 --> 43:56.880
I guess I was reading it.

43:56.880 --> 43:57.760
No, listen.

43:57.760 --> 43:58.720
I put it in the question.

43:58.720 --> 44:00.240
Stop, stop, please stop and listen.

44:00.240 --> 44:01.120
Please stop and listen.

44:01.120 --> 44:01.620
Listen.

44:02.480 --> 44:06.480
There's not a toilet on earth that only you have used.

44:07.120 --> 44:10.080
There is not a toilet on the planet that exists

44:10.080 --> 44:12.880
that only knows your brand.

44:15.280 --> 44:17.120
Every toilet you have ever used,

44:17.120 --> 44:18.960
you may have been the first one to use it

44:19.600 --> 44:21.600
and maybe in that moment you were the only,

44:21.600 --> 44:24.160
but that was not, it's not permanent.

44:24.160 --> 44:26.400
There's no, there are very few people,

44:26.400 --> 44:28.640
aside from the mega rich, I assume,

44:28.640 --> 44:31.840
who just don't, don't have their own toilet.

44:31.840 --> 44:34.560
And I think your landlord has that

44:34.560 --> 44:37.280
and knows that he is special because of it

44:37.280 --> 44:38.880
and has to keep it somewhere.

44:40.080 --> 44:40.580
Huh.

44:41.360 --> 44:42.480
You got to call the police.

44:43.040 --> 44:44.880
They exist for this exact reason.

44:46.880 --> 44:48.880
911, what's your emergency?

44:48.880 --> 44:50.320
Listen, this is going to sound weird,

44:50.320 --> 44:52.880
but I found a toilet in my, we'll be right there.

44:52.880 --> 44:54.800
Every cop in the world is on the way.

44:54.800 --> 44:56.880
Listen, we're going to take good care of you.

44:56.880 --> 44:59.920
Don't panic, but get out of the house.

44:59.920 --> 45:02.960
Do you have a cupboard you can crawl into and get small?

45:05.360 --> 45:09.120
Do you know, let me get through this thought.

45:10.720 --> 45:16.960
Do you know how ragged your action has to be

45:16.960 --> 45:21.040
that the first time that you move in with your new bride

45:21.040 --> 45:23.920
and you use the bathroom, she grabs you by the lapels

45:23.920 --> 45:25.440
and she's coming out and says,

45:25.440 --> 45:28.160
you look at me, Ralph Sperling, I'm not going to leave

45:28.160 --> 45:30.320
because I made a promise in front of the God

45:30.320 --> 45:32.640
and our family and everything.

45:32.640 --> 45:36.880
But if you ever, ever do that in our home again,

45:36.880 --> 45:39.840
I, God, I need you to buy another house

45:39.840 --> 45:43.360
to put those in because you're not going to my house

45:43.360 --> 45:46.400
with my dad's ashes and all my different paintings

45:46.400 --> 45:47.920
and my wedge wood and everything.

45:47.920 --> 45:49.360
You're not doing that in my home.

45:49.360 --> 45:51.280
We're going to have children here someday.

45:51.280 --> 45:52.880
You can't do that here.

45:52.880 --> 45:56.080
You're going to buy another house.

45:56.080 --> 45:57.680
This is an antique couch.

45:57.680 --> 45:58.880
This isn't happening here.

45:58.880 --> 45:59.840
Who's going to live there?

45:59.840 --> 46:01.600
I don't give a shit who lives there, Ralph.

46:01.600 --> 46:03.520
Hopefully nobody for their sakes,

46:03.520 --> 46:05.760
but that is where you will put these crimes.

46:05.760 --> 46:07.840
You lock that shame in the basement.

46:08.480 --> 46:11.120
They can't even know you do it there.

46:11.120 --> 46:11.920
That's locked up.

46:11.920 --> 46:14.800
And then every year I just come and brick over it.

46:14.800 --> 46:16.320
Cascavina Montalano style.

46:16.880 --> 46:18.560
So no big deal.

46:18.560 --> 46:19.760
It's completely fine.

46:19.760 --> 46:23.200
Once the toilet starts to melt from my leavings,

46:23.200 --> 46:24.880
I should just brick over the room.

46:26.480 --> 46:27.680
That's probably what this is.

46:27.680 --> 46:29.840
It's just like, you know, there is,

46:29.840 --> 46:31.040
for a fact, bunkers.

46:31.680 --> 46:33.200
There was one planned,

46:33.200 --> 46:34.960
or it was built in West Virginia,

46:35.680 --> 46:37.360
that Greenbrier for like,

46:37.360 --> 46:38.800
this is a case of nuclear attack.

46:38.800 --> 46:40.640
This is where we take people from the government.

46:40.640 --> 46:42.400
But once you know that location,

46:42.400 --> 46:43.920
like, well, we got to build another one.

46:44.480 --> 46:46.080
Like, I think that this is that,

46:46.080 --> 46:49.280
like he probably has a secret toilet

46:49.280 --> 46:51.200
that if you, like, let him know,

46:51.200 --> 46:55.200
like, your house is going to probably be gone tomorrow.

46:55.200 --> 46:58.400
Yeah, or it dissolves from the stuff you do in it,

46:58.400 --> 47:00.800
and then you got to sell that house and buy a new house.

47:02.080 --> 47:04.480
Could we get an HGTV show out of this?

47:05.680 --> 47:07.520
And maybe you only get one episode a year.

47:07.520 --> 47:08.560
Toilet hunters.

47:08.560 --> 47:11.600
I'm thinking Flip or Plop.

47:12.240 --> 47:13.520
Okay, very good.

47:13.520 --> 47:14.080
I like that.

47:14.720 --> 47:19.040
I'm thinking Plopperty Brother.

47:19.040 --> 47:21.280
One you should do is Flip or Plop Las Vegas

47:21.280 --> 47:23.600
to make people think that there's other ones

47:23.600 --> 47:24.960
that were very successful,

47:24.960 --> 47:26.080
so they should probably watch.

47:26.720 --> 47:27.920
Wow, this is a rough one.

47:28.640 --> 47:31.120
I mean, just let your landlord have this.

47:31.120 --> 47:33.120
I mean, what my advice to you would be

47:34.000 --> 47:36.400
if they'll cut you in on the action.

47:36.400 --> 47:36.960
Yeah.

47:36.960 --> 47:38.560
Okay, I'm going to let you have this secret.

47:39.280 --> 47:40.960
I don't know who you're keeping it from.

47:40.960 --> 47:41.680
I don't care.

47:41.680 --> 47:43.520
I'm not paid to ask questions,

47:43.520 --> 47:45.360
but you are going to give me a key.

47:45.360 --> 47:47.600
It's going to be our little secret now.

47:47.600 --> 47:48.960
Yeah, that could work.

47:48.960 --> 47:51.360
I'm saying that there's another possibility here

47:51.360 --> 47:52.480
that we have looked at this

47:52.480 --> 47:56.160
as like a secret bathroom for your landlord.

47:56.160 --> 47:58.240
But what if when you tell your landlord,

47:58.240 --> 47:59.120
like, what's the deal?

47:59.120 --> 48:01.600
He's like, you didn't use it, did you?

48:01.600 --> 48:05.440
The last 10 people to use that toilet died

48:05.440 --> 48:08.720
in a horrific accident within 24 hours.

48:08.720 --> 48:09.360
It's at the ring.

48:09.360 --> 48:12.080
You got to get somebody else to sit on it.

48:12.080 --> 48:14.640
Can you leave a note in there that says I know?

48:15.200 --> 48:16.240
I mean, yeah.

48:16.240 --> 48:18.800
If you wanted to put everybody on blast,

48:18.800 --> 48:19.760
I think you could get,

48:19.760 --> 48:22.720
you'll need a 3D printer and a bunch of marbles,

48:23.840 --> 48:27.360
but you 3D print out something that looks like toilet paper

48:27.360 --> 48:31.120
and they reach over to get the scrape that they need

48:32.160 --> 48:33.920
and they realize it's not real.

48:33.920 --> 48:35.920
It's 3D printed and it looks really real.

48:35.920 --> 48:38.240
And so they can't yell for help.

48:38.240 --> 48:41.200
And so they do that shameful walk

48:41.200 --> 48:43.600
that they do out into the basement.

48:43.600 --> 48:44.400
Well, what's that?

48:44.400 --> 48:45.680
The marbles are there.

48:45.680 --> 48:46.720
And now you record.

48:47.280 --> 48:48.320
And that's just for you.

48:50.400 --> 48:52.320
And then you never pay rent again.

48:52.320 --> 48:53.760
Never again do you pay rent.

48:54.400 --> 48:55.280
Jesus, that's right.

48:55.280 --> 48:57.120
This is a good opportunity, actually.

48:57.120 --> 48:58.080
You play this right.

48:59.120 --> 49:01.200
This is about as controlled as rent could get.

49:01.920 --> 49:04.960
Play this wrong and that's the ball game.

49:04.960 --> 49:06.240
Yeah, you'll be killed.

49:07.600 --> 49:08.640
Or they will.

49:08.640 --> 49:10.480
It's really important to play it right.

49:10.480 --> 49:13.040
There's a lot of ways that this could go bad.

49:13.680 --> 49:15.120
Hey, I got a Yahoo here I'd love to read.

49:15.120 --> 49:17.040
It's from Ava Willard.

49:17.680 --> 49:19.760
Sorry again if I mispronounced that.

49:19.760 --> 49:21.680
It's from an anonymous Yahoo Answers user.

49:21.680 --> 49:24.320
I'm gonna call Sperling who asks,

49:25.760 --> 49:28.880
is there a place where I can make my own sandwich?

49:30.880 --> 49:33.520
Not the house because if you say the house every year

49:33.520 --> 49:36.160
as funny as every Yahoo Answers user on this page.

49:36.160 --> 49:37.600
Travis, go ahead and say what you're gonna say.

49:38.640 --> 49:39.840
No, go ahead and say what you're gonna say.

49:39.840 --> 49:43.360
No, I was going to say I assume you mean like a restaurant.

49:43.360 --> 49:47.360
Yes, a restaurant where you can go and grab what you want.

49:47.360 --> 49:49.120
Nobody else has to touch it.

49:49.120 --> 49:52.640
I have eaten at Subway maybe twice since the day

49:52.640 --> 49:54.480
that I saw somebody cut their hand open

49:54.480 --> 49:55.680
while making me a sandwich.

49:57.600 --> 49:58.800
I saw that and I said,

49:58.800 --> 50:01.040
I don't think I can come here as often as I do.

50:03.360 --> 50:06.320
This person wants a place where they're in,

50:06.320 --> 50:08.640
they want a place where they're in control.

50:08.640 --> 50:11.840
They want a Dugway for Dugs to get together

50:11.840 --> 50:13.920
and make their own damn sandwiches.

50:13.920 --> 50:15.760
Where they can be the sandwich artist.

50:15.760 --> 50:16.480
Exactly.

50:16.480 --> 50:19.120
Let me eat a sandwich that's like a paint by numbers place,

50:19.120 --> 50:21.040
like a wine and paint place.

50:21.040 --> 50:22.480
Just let me grab the meat with my own hand.

50:23.200 --> 50:26.240
My initial instinct to this was to say,

50:26.240 --> 50:28.880
no, there are no restaurants

50:28.880 --> 50:30.560
where you can make your own sandwich.

50:30.560 --> 50:32.800
And then it occurred to me, I've never asked.

50:33.920 --> 50:37.760
I think if I'm like, hey, just leave the pylons there

50:37.760 --> 50:40.480
on the bar and let me take a spin on this one.

50:40.480 --> 50:42.640
I'm something of a budding,

50:42.640 --> 50:44.640
I'm an outsider sandwich artist

50:45.360 --> 50:47.280
and I feel like I got a new style that could bring to it.

50:47.280 --> 50:49.600
I'm the E.E. Cummings of sandwich artistry.

50:49.600 --> 50:50.100
Sure.

50:51.200 --> 50:52.640
When I was in high school,

50:53.280 --> 50:56.560
I was shown in a science class the film,

50:56.560 --> 50:57.760
The Andromeda Strain,

50:57.760 --> 51:00.560
the Michael Crichton adaptation, The Andromeda Strain.

51:00.560 --> 51:02.320
And there's a lot from that movie that's very like,

51:02.320 --> 51:03.280
it's a good flick,

51:03.280 --> 51:05.280
a lot of stuff that still stands out in my mind from that.

51:05.280 --> 51:09.040
One time I watched it, you know, 13 years ago

51:09.040 --> 51:10.640
and the thing that sticks out the most

51:10.640 --> 51:12.400
is when they're going into the compound

51:12.400 --> 51:15.520
where they're gonna study this virus that's ravaging the world,

51:15.520 --> 51:17.520
they have to pass through this chamber

51:17.520 --> 51:20.560
and they walk through this like fluid that covers their legs

51:20.560 --> 51:22.080
and then there are these bright lights

51:22.080 --> 51:25.200
that flash them with this super bright, hot burst of heat

51:25.200 --> 51:27.280
that hits them very, very fast and hot

51:27.280 --> 51:29.440
and it burns off like the top layer of their skin

51:29.440 --> 51:31.040
just like instantly and painlessly

51:31.040 --> 51:33.360
so that they're fully, fully clean.

51:33.360 --> 51:35.200
And I'm gonna need one of those in the entrance

51:35.200 --> 51:36.320
to every Dugway

51:36.320 --> 51:40.320
if we're gonna be handling big piles of lunch meats together.

51:40.320 --> 51:42.560
I'm gonna need everybody to lose a layer

51:42.560 --> 51:44.800
and then go on, they'll have to be nude

51:44.800 --> 51:46.160
and they lose a layer of the skin

51:46.160 --> 51:47.120
and then you get your clothes back

51:47.120 --> 51:49.040
and this is what the sandwich artists will be doing

51:49.040 --> 51:51.200
is they'll be like facilitating this process

51:51.200 --> 51:52.400
so we don't lose any jobs.

51:53.520 --> 51:54.480
I like that part.

51:54.480 --> 51:55.680
As a concerned citizen,

51:55.680 --> 51:57.840
I love that we're not losing any American jobs.

51:57.840 --> 51:59.840
My favorite part is when we burn all the skin off

51:59.840 --> 52:02.320
so I don't have to touch anybody else's sin.

52:02.960 --> 52:05.440
Somebody just came from their secret basement bathroom.

52:05.440 --> 52:08.240
I don't wanna be the next one to make a roast beef.

52:08.240 --> 52:08.880
You know what I mean?

52:10.480 --> 52:11.760
Can we get a vending machine?

52:11.760 --> 52:14.720
Some sort of, or individually wrapped sort of slices.

52:14.720 --> 52:16.720
Maybe there's other solutions other than burning all the skin.

52:17.280 --> 52:18.160
Here's the thing.

52:18.160 --> 52:20.320
I was gonna give this a hard time of like,

52:21.040 --> 52:22.880
just make it at home.

52:22.880 --> 52:25.200
But I know, I realize, I know Griffin, I know.

52:26.480 --> 52:28.640
But then I also realized that there are restaurants

52:28.640 --> 52:32.960
that you go to where you buy an uncooked pizza

52:32.960 --> 52:35.280
to take it home and make it yourself.

52:35.280 --> 52:37.200
That's right, we discovered this, this territory.

52:37.200 --> 52:42.080
So this has to exist of like, here's the bread.

52:42.800 --> 52:46.640
Here is, I don't know, different forms of greens.

52:47.440 --> 52:51.520
Here is some meat options and we'll look the other way.

52:52.160 --> 52:57.360
It's just the one you've made the most already of.

52:58.480 --> 53:02.240
Did that sentence get across the point I wanted?

53:02.240 --> 53:03.120
I'm not sure.

53:03.120 --> 53:05.680
A sandwich is, of all the things you've made

53:05.680 --> 53:10.320
for yourself already of, sandwiches number one for sure.

53:10.880 --> 53:13.360
If I go to like a Korean barbecue place,

53:13.360 --> 53:14.400
it's exciting for me.

53:14.400 --> 53:17.840
I'm preparing my own sort of meal experience

53:17.840 --> 53:18.880
and it's exciting for me

53:18.880 --> 53:20.800
because I don't make Korean barbecue all the time.

53:21.360 --> 53:24.560
I'm still throwing down three, four sandwiches a week.

53:25.120 --> 53:27.280
And so I don't know that it's that,

53:27.280 --> 53:30.080
it's exciting for me to do this.

53:30.080 --> 53:31.520
And maybe it's a bad idea.

53:31.520 --> 53:34.640
I know we don't usually put those up.

53:34.640 --> 53:37.440
Usually we're just putting up solid gold basketball shots,

53:37.440 --> 53:40.160
but this one seems like it may actually be quite bad.

53:40.160 --> 53:42.960
I will say I'm afraid to dagwood at home.

53:43.600 --> 53:45.440
Oh God, that's what it is.

53:45.440 --> 53:49.040
But I could dagwood somewhere where people might be like,

53:49.040 --> 53:50.640
I'm impressed, right?

53:50.640 --> 53:55.680
And like, that's why I could see this being like,

53:55.680 --> 53:58.240
can you make a sandwich we've never seen before?

53:58.240 --> 54:01.280
Get your name on the wall, like with a photograph.

54:01.280 --> 54:02.880
That kind of thing I'd be down with.

54:03.680 --> 54:05.120
There's some dissonance there.

54:05.120 --> 54:08.160
If I see the orange cat Garfield

54:08.160 --> 54:12.160
or Travis's friend dagwood make a tall sandwich

54:12.160 --> 54:14.240
and then eat it every time I see one of those

54:14.240 --> 54:16.240
on the printed page of my Sunday Funnies,

54:16.960 --> 54:18.880
I think, damn, that looks good.

54:18.880 --> 54:23.280
If I was confronted with a nine inch tall or bigger,

54:23.280 --> 54:27.760
a 14 inch tall ham sandwich that was just piles of meat,

54:27.760 --> 54:30.960
I would see that and say, that seems quite unappetizing.

54:30.960 --> 54:33.280
That seems like a lot of ham to get through.

54:33.280 --> 54:34.720
The thing that's always bothered me

54:34.720 --> 54:36.800
about those cartoon strip sandwiches, by the way,

54:36.800 --> 54:39.120
there's always like a chicken leg or something on there

54:39.120 --> 54:40.320
and there's a bone in there.

54:40.320 --> 54:41.280
There is a bone in that.

54:41.280 --> 54:42.320
I can't chomp through that.

54:42.320 --> 54:43.920
Maybe Garfield can with his powerful jaws.

54:43.920 --> 54:45.280
What are you thinking?

54:45.280 --> 54:48.240
And there's always like a toothpick with an olive on top.

54:48.960 --> 54:50.880
You can't eat that toothpick.

54:50.880 --> 54:52.800
That's gonna hurt your intestines.

54:52.800 --> 54:54.080
Not for cats.

54:54.080 --> 54:56.800
Yeah, Justin, you like sandwich?

54:56.800 --> 54:59.280
Yeah, I love a good sandwich.

54:59.280 --> 55:02.720
I'm pretty much kind of just a meat and potatoes sort of guy.

55:02.720 --> 55:03.040
All right.

55:03.040 --> 55:04.720
You put meat and potatoes on your sandwich?

55:04.720 --> 55:06.560
I just kind of felt like you were letting me and Trav

55:06.560 --> 55:08.080
handle most of the legwork on this one.

55:08.080 --> 55:09.440
I thought maybe you don't like a sandwich.

55:09.440 --> 55:11.360
I wrote like a third of the show earlier,

55:11.360 --> 55:12.080
so I was kind of toasting.

55:12.080 --> 55:12.800
I heard that bit.

55:12.800 --> 55:13.520
I heard that bit.

55:13.520 --> 55:14.720
I was just toasting a little bit.

55:14.720 --> 55:18.320
Can maybe say like one, like contribute.

55:20.880 --> 55:23.520
Maybe like help, like build the bit like with one.

55:25.040 --> 55:25.920
If you weren't paying attention,

55:25.920 --> 55:28.720
I suggested like we burn everyone's skin off who goes in.

55:28.720 --> 55:30.480
Travis is like, we can make tall sandwiches.

55:30.480 --> 55:32.640
So if you want to like get a hand on the ball, what would it say?

55:32.640 --> 55:34.160
Yeah, I got a bit that I've been working on.

55:35.840 --> 55:37.680
It's where I mean kind of lead up to it.

55:37.680 --> 55:42.000
Yeah, but just say, I'll be like, give me the rock.

55:42.000 --> 55:43.600
And Travis, you say like, here's the rock.

55:43.600 --> 55:45.120
Okay, give me the rock.

55:45.120 --> 55:46.080
Oh, here's the rock.

55:46.080 --> 55:47.680
Thanks for listening to our show this week.

55:47.680 --> 55:49.040
We hope you've enjoyed yourself.

55:50.160 --> 55:54.400
This is the end of the show that we've worked so hard on for you.

55:54.400 --> 55:57.600
There's a new episode of Till Death Do Us Blart,

55:57.600 --> 56:01.200
a podcast we create with Tim and Guy

56:01.200 --> 56:02.960
from The Worst Idea of All Time,

56:02.960 --> 56:05.760
which excitingly is heading into its fourth season.

56:05.760 --> 56:08.240
You can hear all about that on this new episode

56:08.240 --> 56:09.280
of Till Death Do Us Blart.

56:09.280 --> 56:12.240
But if you never listened, Blart's a,

56:12.240 --> 56:14.000
Death Blart, as we've come to call it,

56:14.000 --> 56:17.920
is an annual review of Paul Blart Mall Cop 2

56:17.920 --> 56:19.360
hosted by us and Tim and Guy.

56:20.400 --> 56:22.080
And it is a show that will last forever

56:22.080 --> 56:26.640
because we have selected who will take our place

56:26.640 --> 56:28.400
if we are unable to fulfill our roles.

56:29.440 --> 56:31.760
And this is our fourth year watching it.

56:31.760 --> 56:33.920
And folks, it isn't getting better.

56:34.960 --> 56:35.600
It is for me.

56:35.600 --> 56:36.160
It is for me.

56:36.160 --> 56:37.200
The show's getting better.

56:37.200 --> 56:38.480
The movie's getting better for some of us.

56:38.480 --> 56:40.320
Our enjoyment of it is not.

56:40.320 --> 56:45.680
So find that wherever podcasts are right now.

56:46.320 --> 56:49.120
I will also say, well, you're going to be in Austin

56:49.120 --> 56:50.160
and Denver next week.

56:50.160 --> 56:51.840
So if you are going to be at those shows-

56:51.840 --> 56:53.600
This week, the current week you're hearing this.

56:53.600 --> 56:56.720
Yes, if you're going to be at those shows,

56:56.720 --> 56:58.880
send your questions in ahead of time.

56:58.880 --> 57:01.120
Put Austin or Denver.

57:01.120 --> 57:02.800
And just quick clarification,

57:02.800 --> 57:05.440
because I know we now do this in the audience portion.

57:05.440 --> 57:09.760
This is just for that live first half where we read them

57:09.760 --> 57:11.760
and you don't have to stand up and read it.

57:11.760 --> 57:12.080
Yes.

57:12.080 --> 57:13.920
So if you have one of those questions,

57:13.920 --> 57:17.360
email it to us with Austin or Denver in the subject line,

57:17.360 --> 57:19.120
depending on which show you're going to be at.

57:19.120 --> 57:20.960
Yahoo's too, please.

57:20.960 --> 57:23.040
So thanks to John Roderick and the Long Winters

57:23.040 --> 57:24.640
for the East 4 theme song, It's a Departure,

57:24.640 --> 57:26.400
off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

57:26.400 --> 57:29.440
It's a very, very good album and good dude.

57:29.440 --> 57:31.840
And also thanks to Maximum Fun for having us on the network.

57:31.840 --> 57:32.880
You can go to MaximumFun.org.

57:32.880 --> 57:34.400
Check out all the great shows there.

57:34.400 --> 57:37.600
Shows like Story Break and Switchblade Sisters

57:37.600 --> 57:41.600
and Jordan, Jesse Go, and so many more, MaximumFun.org.

57:41.600 --> 57:42.880
I want to do a quick plug.

57:42.880 --> 57:46.320
We just put up a bunch of new holiday merchandise

57:46.320 --> 57:49.200
in our store, McElroy Merch.

57:49.200 --> 57:52.240
McElroyMerch.com.

57:52.240 --> 57:54.000
We have ornaments for the Adventure Zone,

57:54.000 --> 57:55.440
My Brother, My Brother, Me and Sawbones.

57:55.440 --> 57:58.720
We have a What's Up, You Cool Baby decal.

57:58.720 --> 57:59.280
Just went up.

57:59.280 --> 58:03.200
We have a new entry in our line of podcast merchandise.

58:04.320 --> 58:05.440
It's a cross stitch that says,

58:05.440 --> 58:06.960
In this house, we don't say happy holidays,

58:06.960 --> 58:08.320
we say podcasts.

58:08.320 --> 58:10.320
We have a Joyce Candle Nights pin.

58:10.320 --> 58:12.640
Of course, all the normal great stuff that's in there.

58:12.640 --> 58:17.200
So please go to McElroyMerch.com

58:17.200 --> 58:19.680
and buy those things.

58:19.680 --> 58:21.920
That candlelight spin is only up for this month,

58:21.920 --> 58:23.600
so don't sleep.

58:23.600 --> 58:24.880
You only got a few more days.

58:25.760 --> 58:29.040
Also, just real quick, we've got a mailing list,

58:29.040 --> 58:30.160
a mailer that goes out.

58:30.880 --> 58:33.840
You can sign up for it at bit.ly slash McElroy Mail.

58:33.840 --> 58:35.920
It is not a pyramid scheme.

58:36.720 --> 58:39.360
I think maybe that got printed in The Times.

58:39.360 --> 58:40.960
I'm not sure where that's coming from,

58:40.960 --> 58:42.240
but that is incorrect.

58:42.800 --> 58:43.760
I got a Yahoo here.

58:43.760 --> 58:45.440
This one was sent in by Sam Left.

58:45.440 --> 58:46.240
Thank you, Sam.

58:46.240 --> 58:48.000
It'll be our last Yahoo of the show,

58:48.000 --> 58:49.840
so savor it.

58:50.720 --> 58:52.160
It's from Yahoo Answers user,

58:52.160 --> 58:53.360
my mouse cursor's gone.

58:53.920 --> 58:54.480
Where'd it go?

58:55.600 --> 58:57.200
Oh, it's hiding on the other monitor.

58:57.200 --> 58:58.240
You sneak thief.

58:59.520 --> 59:01.360
It's there and something went wrong.

59:01.360 --> 59:02.720
Ah, no, fuck it.

59:02.720 --> 59:03.440
They asked,

59:05.440 --> 59:08.480
Do ants pee and poo and how?

59:13.280 --> 59:15.120
My name is Justin McElroy.

59:15.120 --> 59:17.040
I'm Travis McElroy.

59:17.040 --> 59:18.320
I'm Griffin McElroy.

59:18.320 --> 59:19.440
