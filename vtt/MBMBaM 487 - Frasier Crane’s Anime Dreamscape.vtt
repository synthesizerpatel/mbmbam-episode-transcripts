00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.640 --> 00:48.080
Hello, everybody, and welcome to my brother, my brother, me, and advice show from the modern

00:48.080 --> 00:52.480
era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middlest brother, Travis McElroy.

00:52.480 --> 00:58.880
I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy. I believe that children know our future.

00:58.880 --> 01:05.680
Okay. Teach them well and let them lead the way. Hi, it's local inspiration, Justin McElroy.

01:05.680 --> 01:13.760
Oh, wow. I am here sort of as a podcaster, but now I feel like I've entered my twilight years

01:14.320 --> 01:19.840
as an entertainer and have now transitioned to sort of a Sherpa.

01:19.840 --> 01:21.200
A guiding light.

01:21.200 --> 01:25.280
A guiding light, a Sherpa through these waters that we call podcasts.

01:25.280 --> 01:27.840
You know Sherpas don't lead people through water, right?

01:27.840 --> 01:30.000
Like they can. I'm a water Sherpa.

01:30.560 --> 01:35.440
Okay. If Jimmy Buffett can make a beer called Land Shark, I can make a water Sherpa.

01:35.440 --> 01:41.280
Okay. I am joined in the studio today by a young-

01:41.280 --> 01:43.120
Don't say his name. He ain't ready for that heat.

01:43.120 --> 01:50.240
A young boy, a young local teen who I've taken in off the streets to shadow me and see how-

01:50.240 --> 01:53.520
Now, please don't say it like that. If you say you brought him in from the street,

01:53.520 --> 01:57.440
it makes it sound like almost an Oliver. Did he seek you out or did he-

01:57.440 --> 02:04.160
I gave him my address and he came in from the street through the front door to the house.

02:04.160 --> 02:04.560
Right.

02:04.560 --> 02:11.200
But you didn't like find him, you know, filching handkerchiefs or whatever

02:11.200 --> 02:12.960
and you're giving him a better life.

02:13.520 --> 02:20.000
No, I saw him trying to sell people his underwear and I said, kid, you got something.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.320
You got the gift. You got the talent.

02:22.320 --> 02:26.800
Did his parents suddenly and tragically die in a big acrobat accident?

02:26.800 --> 02:31.840
And now you are the one, now he's your ward. It's one of those situations.

02:32.400 --> 02:36.880
Yes. They died in a tragic acrobat accident. And then what he said was,

02:38.080 --> 02:44.960
Mr. McRoy, if my parents had been able to fall on the most comfortable hybrid mattresses on the

02:44.960 --> 02:51.760
market, they would have been fine. And I said, kid, you got it. You got the goods.

02:51.760 --> 02:54.560
You can't teach that, Justin.

02:54.560 --> 02:56.320
No, no.

02:56.320 --> 03:02.320
It's good stuff. I've got somebody in the studio too that's shadowing me doing,

03:02.320 --> 03:08.000
and he's learning and I'm an inspiration guiding light. I'm like a fire Sherpa.

03:08.640 --> 03:09.680
It's sort of mine.

03:09.680 --> 03:10.160
Wow.

03:10.160 --> 03:14.560
It's Jake. His name is Jake Gyllenhaal.

03:14.560 --> 03:15.760
Oh, wow.

03:15.760 --> 03:20.240
Yeah, he's going to play a movie. He's doing a movie about a podcaster.

03:21.440 --> 03:22.640
Griffin, Inc.

03:22.640 --> 03:27.680
He's doing Griffin, Inc. this time. And his job's not like the other parents' jobs.

03:30.320 --> 03:32.720
And so he's watching me. And what's that, Jake?

03:34.080 --> 03:37.440
Yeah. Okay. Hey, yeah. If you want, there's, yeah, go grab a,

03:37.440 --> 03:39.760
there's some Sobe Life Water down in the fridge. Okay.

03:39.760 --> 03:40.720
I'm disappointed in you guys.

03:40.720 --> 03:46.800
Can I just real quick, real quick, real quick. I can't fucking stand this guy. He's so big.

03:46.800 --> 03:50.240
He's like so animated. And it's like, just come back.

03:50.240 --> 03:54.080
Yeah. The cranberry, save the cranberry one for Rachel. Okay.

03:55.200 --> 03:57.920
He was like, I'm Spider-Man now. I'm Spider-Man now.

03:57.920 --> 04:01.760
And I'm like, you were in Spider-Man. You didn't play Spider-Man.

04:02.560 --> 04:07.360
I am. I also have, well, a shadowing situation happening here.

04:07.360 --> 04:13.040
But unlike you two lazy layabouts, I have the entire-

04:13.040 --> 04:14.640
Two pieces of gum in my pocket.

04:14.640 --> 04:23.200
Well, I have the entire 2019 slash 2020 Harvard Business graduating class shadowing me.

04:23.200 --> 04:24.080
Oh, wow.

04:24.080 --> 04:26.080
Yeah, they're all here in my office.

04:26.080 --> 04:28.880
That must be one hell of a headphone splitter you've got for them.

04:28.880 --> 04:33.200
Yeah. Well, I mean, they're all just being very quiet.

04:33.200 --> 04:36.640
And they're sharing one speaker that they're huddled around.

04:37.280 --> 04:40.960
Like that scene, you know, in Chrissy's story, where they're listening to Little Orphan Annie.

04:40.960 --> 04:41.440
Right, sure.

04:41.440 --> 04:44.000
They're doing that. It's like they're listening to my brother, my brother, and me.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.200
And they're all in the room, but they promise to be really quiet.

04:47.200 --> 04:51.680
Trav, Jake's laughing so hard. Jake Gyllenhaal's really busting a gut on this one.

04:51.680 --> 04:53.040
Why would he be laughing?

04:53.040 --> 04:56.320
Ian, I'm muted for a second, so I wouldn't mess up the recording.

04:56.320 --> 04:58.480
Did you see how I found the pieces of gum in my pocket,

04:58.480 --> 05:00.480
but I didn't make a big deal out of it on the show?

05:00.480 --> 05:01.440
That's really important.

05:03.680 --> 05:04.560
None of them are talking.

05:06.160 --> 05:06.880
Good one, guys.

05:07.680 --> 05:08.880
Yeah, absolutely.

05:09.600 --> 05:13.840
Anyway, I've just found two pieces of gum randomly.

05:13.840 --> 05:15.040
But I didn't make a big deal out of it.

05:15.040 --> 05:16.640
Now, here's the thing, folks at home.

05:16.640 --> 05:19.920
One of us is telling the truth, and the other two are fibbing.

05:19.920 --> 05:23.760
But you'll never know which one it is, right?

05:24.800 --> 05:28.720
That's how we keep the spark alive here at my brother, my brother, and me.

05:28.720 --> 05:31.200
I'm nodding at the entire Harvard business class.

05:31.200 --> 05:32.800
That's how we keep the spark alive.

05:32.800 --> 05:33.360
Two truths and a lie.

05:33.360 --> 05:37.360
Yeah, we keep people interested, because we lie to them two-thirds of the time,

05:37.360 --> 05:40.400
and they never know what is the truth and what's a lie.

05:40.400 --> 05:41.600
We don't have more so...

05:41.600 --> 05:43.360
How did you finish that that fast?

05:43.360 --> 05:45.120
We don't have more Sobey Life water.

05:45.760 --> 05:46.800
Griffin, send them over here.

05:46.800 --> 05:47.360
I have more.

05:47.360 --> 05:47.920
Just send them to the store.

05:47.920 --> 05:49.280
Go to Travis's.

05:49.280 --> 05:50.480
Fly to Cincinnati.

05:52.960 --> 05:53.460
Slam.

05:55.280 --> 05:55.840
Slam.

05:55.840 --> 05:57.040
Hey, Jake.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.360
Yeah, you wanted some more...

05:59.360 --> 06:00.160
No, sorry.

06:00.160 --> 06:00.960
He forgot his keys.

06:00.960 --> 06:01.760
Send him back, Trav.

06:01.760 --> 06:03.280
Okay, you got to go back and get your keys.

06:04.560 --> 06:05.060
Slam.

06:06.720 --> 06:07.520
Slam.

06:07.520 --> 06:08.480
Hey, let's do a question.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.280
Yeah, guys, absolutely.

06:11.280 --> 06:12.480
Absolutely.

06:12.480 --> 06:15.440
Time for the first question of the episode.

06:15.440 --> 06:18.320
I recently moved nearby a donut shop.

06:18.320 --> 06:19.600
Oh, that'd be tough.

06:19.600 --> 06:21.440
I used to live next door to a Giovanni's.

06:22.160 --> 06:22.560
Okay.

06:22.560 --> 06:25.760
And I would order garlic bread for every meal.

06:25.760 --> 06:30.720
And then sometimes I would also get stromboli or stromboboli and get doubles.

06:30.720 --> 06:33.840
So I would have a stromboboli dinner and a stromboboli lunch.

06:33.840 --> 06:39.280
Did you collect sort of your sweat during that era to use as a sort of

06:39.280 --> 06:43.120
a general purpose, like, Italian oil dressing seasoning?

06:43.120 --> 06:45.120
Yeah, bechamel, almost.

06:45.120 --> 06:47.760
So the donuts are highly praised in the area.

06:47.760 --> 06:49.280
However, I looked at the reviews.

06:49.280 --> 06:54.160
70% of them talk about how the old man that runs the shop is a huge bully to his customers.

06:54.160 --> 06:59.440
Many reviews even stated how he refused to sell you his donuts if you weren't interested in the daily specials.

06:59.440 --> 07:03.360
Or he puts extra donuts in your bag and charges you for them whether or not you wanted them.

07:03.360 --> 07:08.080
My social anxiety has peaked at the thought of interacting with this man, but I really want to try his donuts.

07:08.080 --> 07:10.080
Brothers, what do I do?

07:10.080 --> 07:16.640
That's from Scared of the Donut Man in St. Paul, Minnesota.

07:16.640 --> 07:17.440
That's what I said.

07:18.960 --> 07:22.880
I have good news and bad news, and they're both the same news.

07:23.600 --> 07:24.080
Okay.

07:24.080 --> 07:26.640
Because you're gonna need to go get these donuts.

07:26.640 --> 07:28.080
That's the bad news.

07:28.080 --> 07:28.720
Absolutely.

07:28.720 --> 07:29.920
We've got no premise.

07:29.920 --> 07:34.320
Yes, because the good news side of this is these donuts are so good

07:34.320 --> 07:42.240
that this business has been able to stay in business even though it sounds like it's owned by a bad business person.

07:42.240 --> 07:42.960
Yeah.

07:42.960 --> 07:43.440
Right?

07:43.440 --> 07:45.520
That's how good these donuts are.

07:45.520 --> 07:51.280
And you find that out sometimes where it's like, oh, yeah, this is like a deli where if you don't know what you want right away, they yell at you.

07:51.280 --> 07:51.840
Right.

07:51.840 --> 07:59.200
But people still go there and they'll say, oh, I go there for the atmosphere and it's fun because, like, the hairdressers are rude to you or whatever.

07:59.200 --> 08:00.160
But that's what I-

08:00.160 --> 08:01.680
Let's not skip over that, Travis.

08:01.680 --> 08:03.840
I want to explore this Dick's Last Resort.

08:03.840 --> 08:10.400
He, that this cantankerous old donut man is spinning on his customers because there are people who like that.

08:10.400 --> 08:20.000
And I feel like you can do like a really mean punk rock donut shop atmo and people are gonna be wicked into it.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.440
Like just a general sort of, I know what you're gonna do with these.

08:24.240 --> 08:27.760
You gotta, I know what you're gonna do with these holes.

08:28.640 --> 08:29.120
Aren't you?

08:29.120 --> 08:29.440
Oh, yeah.

08:29.440 --> 08:31.200
You dirty, you dirty animal.

08:31.200 --> 08:31.840
It's not me.

08:31.840 --> 08:33.280
This is the character I'm playing.

08:33.280 --> 08:34.080
This is the character.

08:34.080 --> 08:38.640
Of the filthy old donut man who is gonna be mean to you.

08:38.640 --> 08:41.200
But then if you call him on it, he's like, you know what?

08:41.200 --> 08:44.640
Take some, take some crullers for the kids.

08:44.640 --> 08:46.640
Oh, that's a good point.

08:46.640 --> 08:48.480
Does he like the back sass?

08:48.480 --> 08:51.120
Is he looking for like a two way sassy exchange?

08:51.120 --> 08:53.440
Hey, fuck you too, old man.

08:53.440 --> 08:53.920
Well, that's not-

08:53.920 --> 08:55.440
Whoa, that's so mean.

08:55.440 --> 08:56.480
That's too mean.

08:56.480 --> 08:58.560
Take some crullers for the kids.

08:58.560 --> 09:01.280
He's like, hey, wait, you gotta pay.

09:01.280 --> 09:04.480
I'll pay, you pay for my balls and then leave.

09:04.480 --> 09:04.960
Whoa, that's illegal.

09:04.960 --> 09:05.680
Without paying.

09:06.560 --> 09:09.760
Hey, your balls are illegal and then you leave.

09:09.760 --> 09:12.320
Well, how did you, oh, you knew the secret code.

09:12.320 --> 09:15.680
These donuts are on the house and these nuts.

09:17.680 --> 09:18.960
Say, are these donuts hot?

09:18.960 --> 09:22.640
And when he says no, up in the bag and say you're not paying for them.

09:22.640 --> 09:23.680
Make some fresh ones.

09:25.040 --> 09:25.680
That's good.

09:26.480 --> 09:30.960
He's really mean and you're like, hey, I know that behind that gruff donut mean exterior,

09:30.960 --> 09:32.480
you're just looking to be loved.

09:32.480 --> 09:34.640
And I want you to know you can't scare me off.

09:34.640 --> 09:36.720
I'll be back tomorrow for more donuts.

09:36.720 --> 09:40.080
And then you do that every day until eventually you're in.

09:40.080 --> 09:43.440
You fall in love, he teaches you how to do the donuts.

09:43.440 --> 09:47.200
I've never read Tuesdays with Maury, but I think this is what happens at first.

09:47.200 --> 09:49.280
Maury is so fucking mean.

09:49.280 --> 09:50.720
He's like, hey, you piece of shit.

09:50.720 --> 09:52.880
I don't want to spend Tuesdays with you.

09:52.880 --> 09:54.400
Yeah, Tuesdays are my day.

09:54.400 --> 10:02.320
I want to briefly talk about donuts in Huntington, because we got a bunch of people coming into Huntington.

10:02.320 --> 10:02.800
Okay.

10:02.800 --> 10:11.040
I would, I just want to remind everybody that the best option for donuts in the area is Jolly Pirate Donuts.

10:11.040 --> 10:11.600
Correct.

10:11.600 --> 10:14.560
The donut box looks like a treasure chest.

10:14.560 --> 10:15.360
Can't beat it.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.160
Ask if they got hot donuts in the back.

10:18.160 --> 10:22.160
If they don't mention it, like up front, you'll be able to find some.

10:22.160 --> 10:28.880
Also, I would 100% recommend that you follow Jolly Pirate on Facebook, because it's fucking radical.

10:28.880 --> 10:29.440
Oh, what are they putting out?

10:29.440 --> 10:34.880
I think it's like one old old man who doesn't fully grok Facebook, but he's crushing it.

10:35.440 --> 10:37.920
It's just, there's a picture that went up.

10:37.920 --> 10:40.000
So they haven't posted for literally two months.

10:41.040 --> 10:47.040
Yesterday, he put up two pictures of donuts in the fryer with the quote.

10:47.840 --> 10:48.320
What?

10:48.320 --> 10:50.080
There's two pictures of donuts in the fryer.

10:50.080 --> 10:51.360
I'm looking at it now.

10:51.360 --> 10:52.800
It's unbelievable.

10:52.800 --> 10:54.400
Can you read that quote for me, Griff?

10:54.400 --> 10:59.120
The quote said, these are, first of all, not especially well-framed photos of these donuts,

10:59.120 --> 11:07.040
but it says, no baby beats the old man, but beats his B-E-T-S, like the vegetable.

11:07.040 --> 11:07.540
What?

11:08.240 --> 11:10.320
No baby beats the old man.

11:10.320 --> 11:12.480
That's what Jolly Pirate's message is.

11:12.480 --> 11:13.680
I don't know.

11:13.680 --> 11:17.280
It's like they're, I guess they're calling out someone.

11:17.280 --> 11:18.560
I don't know who.

11:18.560 --> 11:25.360
Somebody post like a rival donut place, post a picture of one donut in a fryer,

11:25.360 --> 11:27.120
and they're like, fuck that, we're doing two.

11:27.760 --> 11:35.520
Possible messages for this are one, there's tiny donuts at Peace Love and Little Donuts downtown.

11:36.640 --> 11:39.040
Those are not great.

11:40.240 --> 11:43.680
And then there's, we got a Dunkin, our first Dunkin in town.

11:43.680 --> 11:44.080
What?

11:44.080 --> 11:46.240
And maybe they're making a run at Dunkin.

11:46.240 --> 11:47.040
I don't know.

11:47.040 --> 11:47.840
Oh, I see.

11:47.840 --> 11:52.400
Listen, I like Dunkin, and I don't know about Jolly Pirate's coffee scenario.

11:53.120 --> 11:54.320
Like Dunkin.

11:54.320 --> 11:56.160
Don't, don't, shop local.

11:56.160 --> 11:57.600
Is it possible?

11:57.600 --> 11:59.920
It don't be Jolly Pirate donuts.

11:59.920 --> 12:01.440
Dunkin's donuts are unthinkable.

12:01.440 --> 12:05.120
The idea, do you know why they had, do you know how they legally had to change the name

12:05.120 --> 12:06.400
of the place just to Dunkin?

12:06.400 --> 12:10.240
Because they're not even, they don't even qualify as donuts anymore.

12:10.240 --> 12:12.240
They don't like legally, it's like a legal-

12:12.240 --> 12:14.000
They're just called breaded rings.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.600
If I could flow, is it possible-

12:15.600 --> 12:18.240
That's how Pringles are like potato crisps.

12:18.240 --> 12:18.480
Yeah.

12:18.480 --> 12:24.400
Is it possible that the social media manager for Jolly Pirate Donuts did an extremely questionable

12:24.400 --> 12:25.920
job of quoting Dirty Dancing?

12:28.960 --> 12:29.520
How about a Yahoo?

12:29.520 --> 12:30.560
It's like I always say.

12:31.360 --> 12:34.000
No baby beats the old man.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.160
Nobody puts baby at the intersection.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.360
Okay, so here's a Yahoo.

12:39.360 --> 12:42.720
This one was sent in by, actually a few people sent this one in.

12:42.720 --> 12:44.160
It's by an anonymous Yahoo Answers user.

12:44.160 --> 12:47.440
Oh wait, sorry, I just want to circle back to one thing.

12:47.440 --> 12:52.880
The last post from Jolly Pirate Donuts is a picture of a huge cruise ship going through

12:52.880 --> 12:54.080
a canal in Greece.

12:54.800 --> 12:56.080
Oh, fucking the best.

12:56.080 --> 12:56.640
Yeah, man.

12:57.200 --> 12:58.400
Oh, that's so cool.

12:58.400 --> 13:00.000
Pumpkin cookies now available.

13:00.000 --> 13:00.640
That's something else.

13:00.640 --> 13:03.600
This is a good, this is a premium follow, folks.

13:03.600 --> 13:04.880
This is a premium follow.

13:04.880 --> 13:07.600
Damn, we haven't recommended a premium follow in a while.

13:07.600 --> 13:08.720
You know I'm getting on board.

13:08.720 --> 13:09.200
I'm following-

13:09.200 --> 13:11.920
Jolly Pirates WV on Facebook.

13:11.920 --> 13:17.520
Okay, so anyway, this one sent in by no baby.

13:17.520 --> 13:19.680
I can't stop thinking about no baby beats the old man.

13:19.680 --> 13:20.160
It's got like-

13:20.160 --> 13:20.720
No baby.

13:20.720 --> 13:21.840
No baby beats the old man.

13:21.840 --> 13:22.960
It's got such good-

13:23.840 --> 13:25.920
Until the chosen baby.

13:25.920 --> 13:30.560
It's got pure boomer energy in a way that I wish everything kind of reflected.

13:30.560 --> 13:36.880
But anyway, so no baby asks, Fraser and Niles get caught eating baked beans at the opera.

13:36.880 --> 13:42.400
I am an aspiring screenwriter, and it is my dream to work on the new Fraser reboot.

13:42.400 --> 13:44.000
Would this be a good episode idea?

13:45.520 --> 13:52.560
We've all been waiting for this opportunity to fall in, not our laps, but someone's laps,

13:52.560 --> 13:58.720
so that we can run over, slap it out of their lap, and onto our lap, and make it our Fraser reboot.

13:59.760 --> 14:04.720
But this idea of Fraser and Niles get caught eating baked beans at the opera,

14:04.720 --> 14:09.520
I feel like we could think and think our three brains locked it together,

14:10.320 --> 14:16.000
completing the cerebral puzzle as it were, and we would not come up with anything that good.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.480
But I'm, you know, I'm open to suggestions, I guess.

14:20.480 --> 14:21.520
Here's-

14:21.520 --> 14:22.080
Okay.

14:22.880 --> 14:27.280
Here's what, to catch you guys up while you think about your answers,

14:27.280 --> 14:29.840
I want to, what's the latest on the Fraser reboot?

14:29.840 --> 14:32.960
This is the Fraser reboot watch, which is a new segment.

14:32.960 --> 14:37.840
This is from 10 days ago.

14:40.480 --> 14:43.360
While visiting in depth with Graham Bessinger last week,

14:43.360 --> 14:47.520
Grammer said that while no network has taken in the cranes just yet,

14:47.520 --> 14:50.720
he approved of an idea for the new season.

14:50.720 --> 14:51.840
This is from Vulture.

14:51.840 --> 14:54.240
And this is Kelsey, this is Kelsey Grammer speaking.

14:54.240 --> 14:56.880
This is Kelsey Grammer of Fraser fame.

14:56.880 --> 15:01.280
He played the, one of the main big characters on there, Fraser.

15:01.280 --> 15:02.960
The titular Fraser.

15:02.960 --> 15:04.560
He played Fraser.

15:04.560 --> 15:06.560
Okay, so here's the quote.

15:07.120 --> 15:08.160
We got it hatched.

15:08.720 --> 15:09.680
We've hatched the plan.

15:10.960 --> 15:12.800
What we think is the right way to go.

15:14.080 --> 15:16.000
We're sort of on standby a little bit.

15:17.200 --> 15:18.800
Hey, where's my Bim Bam season two?

15:19.760 --> 15:20.960
We hatched it.

15:20.960 --> 15:21.920
We hatched it.

15:21.920 --> 15:22.720
We hatched the plan.

15:22.720 --> 15:23.920
It's a holding pattern.

15:23.920 --> 15:26.960
But you know how like you hatch a baby and then like a baby bird,

15:26.960 --> 15:29.520
and then the baby bird is just on standby for a while?

15:29.520 --> 15:30.240
Don't worry about it.

15:30.240 --> 15:32.800
Here's, we're kind of on standby for a little bit.

15:32.800 --> 15:34.320
And this is another one that we can steal.

15:35.040 --> 15:38.400
Working out a couple of possible network deals that we're circling.

15:39.280 --> 15:44.240
So we're kind of, there's the deals below us and like the majestic hawk.

15:44.240 --> 15:46.560
We are circling the deals.

15:46.560 --> 15:49.520
So we just hatched the hawk and it's also circling.

15:49.520 --> 15:50.080
Don't let that confuse you.

15:50.080 --> 15:53.600
We've hatched the hawk of deals and it's circling the deals.

15:53.600 --> 15:55.040
And let's dive back into this quote.

15:55.040 --> 15:56.400
Just like a hawk.

15:56.400 --> 16:00.480
There's still stuff going on, but a revisit to Frasier, comma,

16:00.480 --> 16:04.000
Frasier's world is, I think, definitely going to come.

16:04.000 --> 16:08.560
Now, Vulture has taken a step here to not italicize Frasier's world,

16:09.120 --> 16:14.880
which seems strange because I do think that when Kelsey Grammer said that,

16:14.880 --> 16:21.040
he was dropping the world premiere name of the reboot Frasier's world.

16:22.480 --> 16:24.000
It'll be Frasier's world.

16:24.000 --> 16:27.040
And at this point, you get to go inside of his mindscape.

16:27.760 --> 16:31.760
And so it's part animated, by which I mean like anime.

16:31.760 --> 16:33.200
It's all anime in there.

16:34.080 --> 16:35.840
Like inside Frasier's head?

16:35.840 --> 16:36.960
Yeah, in his mind.

16:36.960 --> 16:38.640
Because he's always talking about other people's minds.

16:38.640 --> 16:42.400
In this one, you get to go into Frasier's world, which is what he calls his anime.

16:42.400 --> 16:44.800
In this one, Frasier has been in some kind of accident.

16:44.800 --> 16:46.240
Maybe he's in a coma.

16:46.240 --> 16:49.360
And we're getting to see the dreamscape in which Frasier lives.

16:49.360 --> 16:49.840
I get it.

16:49.840 --> 16:51.280
Okay, yeah, that's obvious.

16:51.280 --> 16:53.600
We find out the entire first series was a dream

16:53.600 --> 16:55.440
because Kelsey Grammer hates the first series.

16:55.440 --> 16:56.800
So he wants to undo it.

16:56.800 --> 17:01.920
He always wanted it to be based around Frasier Crane's anime dreamscape.

17:01.920 --> 17:02.420
Yes.

17:03.440 --> 17:06.320
John Mahoney hologram.

17:06.320 --> 17:10.400
So Frasier and Niles are eating some beans at the opera.

17:10.400 --> 17:11.520
Baked beans.

17:11.520 --> 17:12.080
Baked beans.

17:12.080 --> 17:14.640
Not a fancy bean like a garbanzo.

17:15.360 --> 17:16.800
And what I love about this,

17:16.800 --> 17:19.600
this premise that this aspiring screenwriter has set up,

17:19.600 --> 17:23.600
is the issue is not that they are eating baked beans at the opera.

17:23.600 --> 17:26.000
It's that they're caught eating baked beans at the opera.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.120
They fucked up.

17:27.120 --> 17:27.840
Yeah.

17:27.840 --> 17:29.360
Now, so here's the question.

17:29.360 --> 17:30.640
Let's roll back.

17:31.440 --> 17:32.320
How did we get here?

17:32.320 --> 17:34.560
Maybe we start in media rows.

17:34.560 --> 17:36.320
The first thing, they're caught.

17:36.320 --> 17:37.040
Break the story.

17:37.040 --> 17:38.880
Right, they're caught, right?

17:38.880 --> 17:41.600
Hey, there's a flashlight from an usher.

17:41.600 --> 17:43.840
Maybe the usher is like a young person.

17:43.840 --> 17:45.680
So their voice breaks when they say like,

17:45.680 --> 17:50.480
Mr. Crane, no baked beans at the opera for the last time.

17:50.480 --> 17:53.760
And then we just see them on the floor eating loose baked beans.

17:53.760 --> 17:57.600
And now we then start back at the beginning to get there.

17:57.600 --> 18:02.480
So this is the premiere of Frasier's World.

18:02.480 --> 18:04.080
This is the first episode.

18:04.080 --> 18:08.240
You haven't seen Kelsey in a couple decades,

18:08.240 --> 18:10.480
except for that one very viral video

18:10.480 --> 18:12.320
where he did eat shit off the stage.

18:12.320 --> 18:13.760
Yes, other than that though.

18:13.760 --> 18:16.240
We all remember that and love that.

18:16.240 --> 18:18.240
That was practically a Frasier reboot.

18:18.240 --> 18:21.040
A very, very short, very, very small, very delightful.

18:21.040 --> 18:23.360
Frasier's plummet to the ground.

18:24.880 --> 18:25.840
And he's come back.

18:25.840 --> 18:28.320
So after the in media res opening,

18:28.320 --> 18:33.520
we show him and they are mourning the loss of the chair,

18:33.520 --> 18:34.560
which is fucked up.

18:34.560 --> 18:35.760
The chair is gone.

18:35.760 --> 18:38.480
And so, and the dad wanted the chair to be,

18:40.480 --> 18:42.320
you know, what's the word?

18:42.320 --> 18:44.080
Immolated, disintegrated.

18:44.080 --> 18:45.360
What's the word I'm looking for?

18:45.360 --> 18:48.160
Yeah, I think it's evaporated.

18:48.160 --> 18:49.840
And he was like, and don't worry about it.

18:49.840 --> 18:52.560
Just put it in a can of baked beans.

18:53.120 --> 18:53.920
Okay.

18:53.920 --> 18:55.680
So he doesn't want like a fancy urn

18:55.680 --> 18:57.280
because he's not a fancy person

18:57.280 --> 18:59.840
like old Garbanzo Niles over here.

18:59.840 --> 19:00.340
Yes.

19:01.200 --> 19:03.760
Is Niles and Frasier eating their dad?

19:03.760 --> 19:07.280
No, but they gotta get the can from somewhere.

19:07.280 --> 19:10.480
Well, yeah, I'm saying that, oh, so they need the can.

19:10.480 --> 19:12.240
I thought you were saying Griffin,

19:12.240 --> 19:13.360
because where I was going to go with it

19:13.360 --> 19:15.600
is they put the ashes of the chair

19:15.600 --> 19:17.360
into the can of baked beans.

19:17.360 --> 19:20.240
Oh, and then it like made a,

19:20.240 --> 19:22.000
like a chair slurry, Travis?

19:22.000 --> 19:24.240
Yes, but then the baked beans spill,

19:24.240 --> 19:26.480
while the can maybe gets destroyed.

19:26.480 --> 19:26.800
Okay.

19:26.800 --> 19:29.200
And now they need to get the baked beans out of there.

19:29.200 --> 19:30.800
And the only way they can think to do it

19:30.800 --> 19:32.960
is by smuggling in their tum-tums.

19:32.960 --> 19:33.600
That's cool.

19:34.400 --> 19:37.360
Frasier's like some dumb old, it's old.

19:37.360 --> 19:39.360
Hey, Justin, you're not muted.

19:39.360 --> 19:40.880
I pretend to like it for my brothers,

19:40.880 --> 19:42.240
because they're like old and boring,

19:42.240 --> 19:45.680
but hey, did Frasier end with Roz and Frasier getting together?

19:45.680 --> 19:46.560
Because that's what I want.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.120
Absolutely, Trav.

19:49.120 --> 19:49.600
Okay, cool.

19:50.320 --> 19:50.800
Do you think they're going to be back?

19:50.800 --> 19:52.640
It's weird, just you keep cutting out,

19:52.640 --> 19:55.120
and then you come back in yelling absolutely,

19:55.120 --> 19:57.920
but not sort of responding to the thing that the people said.

19:58.560 --> 20:02.320
I'm just bringing like positive energy to the show,

20:02.320 --> 20:03.280
trying to keep it going, you know?

20:03.280 --> 20:04.160
Yeah, for sure.

20:04.160 --> 20:06.320
So anyway, what I've just done

20:06.320 --> 20:08.720
is in Hollywood terms called a bump.

20:08.720 --> 20:10.800
And I'm looking for, Travis has said it,

20:10.800 --> 20:12.320
so Justin, you go ahead and spike it

20:12.320 --> 20:13.600
right across the net line.

20:15.120 --> 20:18.240
We've established the sort of baked beans narrative.

20:18.240 --> 20:18.960
Yes.

20:18.960 --> 20:19.600
Take us home.

20:20.560 --> 20:24.880
Okay, so they need, what are they still lacking?

20:24.880 --> 20:26.320
A can, right?

20:26.320 --> 20:28.720
We've got the can, nope, we've got the can.

20:28.720 --> 20:30.000
They were caught eating it.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
You got caught eating it, finish it.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.320
We're at the opera, they have the can,

20:34.320 --> 20:36.480
they've spilled the can, they're eating it off the floor.

20:36.480 --> 20:38.480
Okay, the problem is-

20:38.480 --> 20:40.160
Why are they eating it at the opera?

20:40.160 --> 20:42.160
They're eating dirty chair chili off,

20:42.160 --> 20:44.800
because they were gonna go throw it over the big cliff

20:44.800 --> 20:46.560
like their dad asked to scatter the chair.

20:46.560 --> 20:48.080
But then they saw that the opera was in town.

20:48.080 --> 20:50.640
But then they saw the, and like a moth to a flame,

20:50.640 --> 20:52.720
these two fancy fucks went to the opera.

20:52.720 --> 20:55.280
And they said, we can throw it after the fancy opera.

20:55.280 --> 20:55.840
But what happened?

20:55.840 --> 20:57.120
They spilled it on the floor

20:57.120 --> 20:59.680
and they have to eat the chair chili off the fucking floor

20:59.680 --> 21:00.560
like a couple of dogs.

21:00.560 --> 21:02.560
Oh shit, okay, listen, are you guys ready?

21:02.560 --> 21:03.520
I'm about to pitch you what-

21:03.520 --> 21:05.440
Travis, Justin needs to spike it.

21:05.440 --> 21:06.880
Okay, yes, you spike it Griffin,

21:06.880 --> 21:10.880
and then I will sell it in the room, the Frasier reboot.

21:11.760 --> 21:16.320
So B-plot, Daphne is-

21:16.320 --> 21:17.120
Oh, she's back.

21:18.160 --> 21:19.840
She's back, but here's the thing,

21:19.840 --> 21:22.480
she runs a company now.

21:22.480 --> 21:22.980
Okay.

21:23.760 --> 21:25.680
And she's incorporating.

21:26.240 --> 21:28.880
In this episode, she's filing the papers to incorporate.

21:28.880 --> 21:29.380
Okay.

21:30.320 --> 21:31.360
So back to you, Travis.

21:31.360 --> 21:33.520
Okay, I don't see how that helps me resolve-

21:33.520 --> 21:37.040
Oh, maybe her business is she now runs

21:37.040 --> 21:41.040
like a huge cleaning service organization

21:41.040 --> 21:43.600
that now she is the head of

21:43.600 --> 21:47.120
and now she gets the contract to clean the bean mess.

21:47.120 --> 21:48.000
And they don't want-

21:49.920 --> 21:50.560
The opera-

21:50.560 --> 21:52.800
I can't find a name for me company.

21:53.520 --> 21:54.720
Wait a minute, I'll get it.

21:55.520 --> 21:58.000
Empty can of baked beans, LLC.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
And they all tie back together.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.440
It all ties back.

22:01.440 --> 22:02.320
Now, are you ready?

22:02.320 --> 22:04.720
Here's how I'm going to, if you're listening, Kelsey Grammer,

22:04.720 --> 22:08.160
which I know you are, you dirty boy.

22:08.160 --> 22:11.120
Okay, here, I'm gonna give you your pitch.

22:11.120 --> 22:12.800
Mr. Grammer, this is such an honor.

22:12.800 --> 22:13.280
Oh my God.

22:13.280 --> 22:14.560
Yeah, thank you for listening.

22:14.560 --> 22:16.800
I listened to your autobiography,

22:16.800 --> 22:19.120
the audio book version of it.

22:19.120 --> 22:19.920
Grammer Crackers?

22:20.720 --> 22:22.080
So far, no.

22:22.080 --> 22:22.580
Okay.

22:23.040 --> 22:23.680
In this one-

22:23.680 --> 22:26.240
It was Country Grammer was the name of it.

22:26.240 --> 22:26.720
Country Grammer.

22:28.640 --> 22:29.920
Goes written by Nelly.

22:29.920 --> 22:31.760
It's actually Grammer's Cool.

22:31.760 --> 22:32.560
Grammer's Cool.

22:34.320 --> 22:36.880
In this one, rather than the dad coming to live

22:36.880 --> 22:40.320
with Kelsey Grammer, AKA Frasier, right?

22:40.320 --> 22:42.160
And him being the fish out of water.

22:42.160 --> 22:44.400
This one, Frasier goes to live with his dad

22:45.040 --> 22:48.320
in a rural town where Frasier just doesn't fit in.

22:48.320 --> 22:50.800
John Mahoney did sadly pass away.

22:50.800 --> 22:51.120
So I don't-

22:51.120 --> 22:52.000
Remember we talked about-

22:52.000 --> 22:53.200
It's a reboot, Griffin.

22:53.200 --> 22:54.560
It's gonna be different now.

22:54.560 --> 22:56.560
We already talked about John Mahoney hologram.

22:57.600 --> 22:58.080
Yeah, that's established.

22:58.080 --> 23:00.240
It's problematic in a few ways.

23:00.240 --> 23:02.160
I would love to come into this one clean.

23:02.160 --> 23:03.360
I would love to come into this one clean.

23:03.360 --> 23:05.600
In this one, Kelsey Grammer plays the dad.

23:06.640 --> 23:09.440
Okay, now we're on some Honey Boy shit

23:09.440 --> 23:11.040
and I'm back fucking on board.

23:11.040 --> 23:16.560
We got a young, fancy person to play the titular Frasier.

23:16.560 --> 23:18.800
Everybody bumps up one character.

23:18.800 --> 23:20.160
Everyone bumps up one character.

23:20.160 --> 23:22.320
And who comes in at the bottom to play Frasier?

23:22.320 --> 23:23.840
It's young Sheldon.

23:23.840 --> 23:26.240
Not the actor that plays young Sheldon.

23:26.240 --> 23:29.360
It's young motherfucking Sheldon comes in.

23:29.360 --> 23:31.520
ABC, CBS, NBC.

23:32.880 --> 23:33.680
Okay, I'm sorry.

23:33.680 --> 23:36.080
I have to quibble with you.

23:36.080 --> 23:39.920
Young Sheldon would have to come in to play the dog Eddie

23:39.920 --> 23:43.600
in the hopes that something would be loosened up

23:43.600 --> 23:44.800
at some point.

23:44.800 --> 23:46.880
And then he would be in the running after that

23:46.880 --> 23:51.200
to take over Niles because it funnels by age, right?

23:51.200 --> 23:51.760
Right.

23:51.760 --> 23:54.800
So you're saying David Hyde Pierce would play Frasier?

23:54.800 --> 23:55.760
And Eddie the dog would play Niles?

23:55.760 --> 23:57.200
David Hyde Pierce would be Frasier.

23:57.200 --> 23:57.760
That's right.

23:57.760 --> 23:58.240
Okay.

23:58.240 --> 23:59.440
Yes.

23:59.440 --> 24:00.720
Well, okay, sorry.

24:00.720 --> 24:02.000
Roz would have to play Niles

24:02.000 --> 24:04.240
because I think Roz is probably above Eddie the dog.

24:05.200 --> 24:06.320
Just on the call list.

24:06.320 --> 24:07.760
Let's keep shaking the tree, guys.

24:07.760 --> 24:08.800
That is how it works.

24:08.800 --> 24:11.040
That's how it worked on Roseanne when she got booted.

24:11.040 --> 24:14.240
Lori Metcalf was like, now I'm, it's called Metcalf now.

24:14.240 --> 24:16.000
Welcome to Metcalf.

24:16.000 --> 24:16.720
You know what sucks?

24:16.720 --> 24:18.480
And why I've been actually distracted is

24:18.480 --> 24:23.600
I can't stop thinking about how terrifyingly close

24:23.600 --> 24:28.240
the last 10 minutes probably actually really were

24:28.240 --> 24:31.120
to some of the breaking of stories for Frasier,

24:31.120 --> 24:32.880
especially towards the end.

24:32.880 --> 24:35.360
I feel like if you swapped out baked beans

24:35.360 --> 24:36.560
with another proper now,

24:36.560 --> 24:40.000
we probably would have gotten to a solid spec.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.520
There was probably a lot of pitch meetings

24:41.520 --> 24:44.320
that were just like, Frasier's in Vegas.

24:44.320 --> 24:46.880
Okay, you got 48 hours to give me 20 pages.

24:47.600 --> 24:48.480
That was it.

24:48.480 --> 24:51.360
Hey guys, I got a segment I want to do.

24:51.360 --> 24:53.280
Oh yeah, set it up, Trav.

24:53.280 --> 24:56.320
So I tried this segment out in Milwaukee.

24:56.320 --> 24:56.800
I loved it.

24:56.800 --> 24:58.080
I'm going to do it again.

24:58.080 --> 25:03.200
Basically, I call it reach for the stars.

25:03.200 --> 25:05.120
And in it, I'm going to read you guys

25:05.120 --> 25:06.560
a couple of Amazon reviews

25:06.560 --> 25:09.920
and I'll give you like the review and the star rating.

25:09.920 --> 25:11.280
And you guys are going to try to guess

25:12.000 --> 25:14.320
what the product they're reviewing is.

25:15.680 --> 25:17.360
Now this first one here,

25:17.360 --> 25:19.680
this is a one out of five star review.

25:19.680 --> 25:20.160
Oh no.

25:20.880 --> 25:22.800
It may have just been a warehouse issue,

25:22.800 --> 25:25.360
but there was nothing inside the package.

25:25.360 --> 25:26.880
It was a white and blue envelope

25:26.880 --> 25:28.640
and there was nothing in it.

25:28.640 --> 25:30.480
It was even sealed as well.

25:30.480 --> 25:31.920
Would not recommend.

25:31.920 --> 25:33.280
It even had tracking,

25:33.280 --> 25:35.280
but there was nothing inside.

25:35.280 --> 25:37.840
Someone had to seal the package at the West house

25:37.840 --> 25:39.920
knowing there was nothing inside.

25:40.800 --> 25:42.880
This is an anti-clue you have given us.

25:45.200 --> 25:46.720
I know less about the product now

25:46.720 --> 25:47.840
than I did when we started.

25:47.840 --> 25:49.840
Let me give you one piece of information here.

25:49.840 --> 25:50.080
Okay.

25:50.080 --> 25:53.520
This is another one out of five star review.

25:53.520 --> 25:53.920
Toy.

25:55.040 --> 25:55.520
Okay.

25:55.520 --> 25:57.360
So I, cause I was going to say aphids.

25:58.640 --> 26:00.320
Oh, not a bad guess.

26:00.320 --> 26:00.880
I mean, it is a bad guess.

26:00.880 --> 26:03.680
You open up the bag and aphids come out

26:03.680 --> 26:04.560
and you don't even see them.

26:04.560 --> 26:06.080
You're like, this bag was empty,

26:06.080 --> 26:07.440
but really there was the aphids

26:07.440 --> 26:08.640
you bought and forgot about.

26:08.640 --> 26:09.200
That's pretty good.

26:09.200 --> 26:10.480
But if it's a toy.

26:11.760 --> 26:12.240
Toy.

26:12.240 --> 26:13.920
Now remember that's a one star review.

26:14.960 --> 26:17.120
Oh, so it's, they didn't want it to be a toy.

26:17.120 --> 26:19.120
They wanted it to be a business.

26:19.120 --> 26:21.280
Highlander replica sword.

26:21.280 --> 26:22.320
Highlander replica sword.

26:22.320 --> 26:23.600
Good guess, good guess.

26:23.600 --> 26:26.720
What about like a, you know, a funny stapler,

26:26.720 --> 26:30.000
like a office space theme stapler, you know?

26:30.000 --> 26:30.480
Okay.

26:30.480 --> 26:32.240
Something businessy, not a toy.

26:32.240 --> 26:34.000
One of you is on the right track.

26:34.000 --> 26:34.800
And I won't tell you what,

26:34.800 --> 26:36.480
but one of you is on the right track.

26:36.480 --> 26:38.480
Now this is a five out of five star review

26:39.280 --> 26:40.400
and this might help a lot.

26:41.200 --> 26:42.880
Very realistic looking.

26:42.880 --> 26:45.040
They fool most people.

26:45.040 --> 26:46.880
Made of good quality materials.

26:46.880 --> 26:47.920
Awesome price.

26:47.920 --> 26:49.760
And most important, fun.

26:50.720 --> 26:52.480
I've changed my answer significantly

26:52.480 --> 26:54.640
because now I think it's full blown shit.

26:54.640 --> 26:57.760
I think it's a full blown, goofy, goofy, rubbery shit

26:57.760 --> 26:59.440
that you would put on the floor of your house.

26:59.440 --> 27:00.880
So your friends walk in and be like,

27:02.000 --> 27:03.360
why is there shit on the floor?

27:03.360 --> 27:04.480
And you're like, it's a joke.

27:04.480 --> 27:06.480
And then they say, why did you want us to think

27:06.480 --> 27:07.760
there was shit on the floor?

27:07.760 --> 27:08.320
One of those.

27:08.960 --> 27:09.280
Okay.

27:09.280 --> 27:12.000
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle replica nunchucks.

27:12.000 --> 27:13.200
Okay, okay.

27:13.840 --> 27:15.280
Now here's the final one.

27:15.280 --> 27:16.320
Five out of five stars.

27:16.320 --> 27:19.040
Son got them for drama class.

27:19.040 --> 27:20.400
Very realistic.

27:20.400 --> 27:21.600
Teacher impressed.

27:22.960 --> 27:24.080
I'm back to aphids.

27:25.680 --> 27:26.880
I'm right back on aphids.

27:28.640 --> 27:30.560
Well, how do you think the aphids

27:30.560 --> 27:32.400
would be deployed in drama class?

27:32.400 --> 27:34.160
In an impressive way, it sounds like.

27:34.160 --> 27:35.200
It'd be fucking cool, man.

27:35.200 --> 27:37.600
If you're doing like a monologue from some play

27:37.600 --> 27:39.120
that had aphids in it.

27:39.120 --> 27:41.040
Or a monologue from like Bugs Life.

27:41.040 --> 27:44.880
Bugs Life and monologue or from ants would be funny.

27:44.880 --> 27:46.880
Um, no, okay, I'm back on sort of,

27:46.880 --> 27:49.760
I'm sort of leaning towards Justin's prop weapons now.

27:49.760 --> 27:50.960
I'm gonna stick with nunchucks.

27:50.960 --> 27:51.920
Oh, nope.

27:51.920 --> 27:54.240
We're looking at fake cigarettes.

27:54.240 --> 27:55.360
Fake cigarettes.

27:55.360 --> 27:57.120
Fake cigarettes.

27:57.120 --> 28:00.160
Now, I have one more here and I will tell you.

28:00.160 --> 28:02.080
Now wait, can we stop for a second?

28:02.080 --> 28:02.320
Uh-huh.

28:03.520 --> 28:05.440
Someone thought they were ordering

28:05.440 --> 28:07.280
real cigarettes from Amazon.

28:07.280 --> 28:07.680
Toy.

28:08.960 --> 28:09.440
Toy.

28:10.080 --> 28:14.480
Hey, these didn't, I didn't feel anything with these.

28:14.480 --> 28:16.000
This is a toy.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
Where's all the cool smoke?

28:18.000 --> 28:18.880
Got one more here now.

28:18.880 --> 28:19.920
I will go ahead and tell you guys

28:19.920 --> 28:21.920
this is another novelty.

28:21.920 --> 28:22.240
Okay.

28:22.240 --> 28:23.520
Uh, cause that will become clear

28:23.520 --> 28:26.000
from this first five out of five star review.

28:26.000 --> 28:29.840
Yeah, buddy, fooled my whole family at Easter, lol.

28:30.480 --> 28:32.960
Fake dookie, fake dookie, fake dookie.

28:32.960 --> 28:37.120
I would hate to be one answer off with my fake dookie,

28:37.120 --> 28:41.040
but um, uh, yeah, yeah, fake dookie.

28:41.040 --> 28:43.120
I mean, you guys got it and won.

28:43.120 --> 28:44.160
Oh wow, really?

28:44.160 --> 28:45.440
Yeah, but I'll read the rest of the reviews

28:45.440 --> 28:46.800
cause they're very good.

28:46.800 --> 28:47.360
Okay, okay.

28:47.360 --> 28:49.440
This is a five out of five star review.

28:49.440 --> 28:51.840
I was really excited about this variable fools day.

28:51.840 --> 28:54.400
Unfortunately, my dog ate it before my husband could see it

28:54.400 --> 28:56.480
because he was feeling extra petty that day.

28:57.360 --> 29:00.560
That's extra, that's really bad about your marriage

29:00.560 --> 29:02.960
and your dog ate some shit.

29:03.600 --> 29:04.720
That's rough too.

29:04.720 --> 29:07.280
This one is a five out of five review titled

29:07.280 --> 29:09.360
the best fake poop on the market.

29:09.360 --> 29:11.440
Well, we would have gotten it with that one probably Travis.

29:11.440 --> 29:12.800
Yeah, I wouldn't have given you the title,

29:12.800 --> 29:14.960
but I think you probably would have gotten it from this.

29:14.960 --> 29:17.520
When I cleaned out my uncle's house after his passing,

29:17.520 --> 29:19.840
I offered up various items to the cousins.

29:19.840 --> 29:22.640
One of the items was an antique porcelain commode.

29:22.640 --> 29:24.480
My one cousin said he wanted it.

29:24.480 --> 29:26.320
I packed it up and shipped it off,

29:26.320 --> 29:29.200
but of course put one of these in it as a gag.

29:30.560 --> 29:32.560
That's a pretty horrible gag I feel like.

29:32.560 --> 29:33.760
It's fucking funny.

29:33.760 --> 29:35.760
Okay, now one more and this one.

29:36.720 --> 29:39.280
Oh my God, five out of five star reviews here.

29:39.280 --> 29:43.120
Got it from my stocking stuffer, parentheses, from Santa,

29:43.120 --> 29:47.520
and parentheses, to myself as a joke for my daughter.

29:47.520 --> 29:49.840
Fuck me.

29:51.680 --> 29:52.560
Do it again.

29:52.560 --> 29:56.080
Got it for my stocking stuffer, parentheses, from Santa,

29:56.080 --> 30:00.160
and parentheses, to myself as a joke for my daughter.

30:00.720 --> 30:03.520
Later that day, took it to my parents' house

30:03.520 --> 30:05.840
and strategically placed it in the hallway

30:05.840 --> 30:08.000
right when the party was going

30:08.000 --> 30:11.520
and then waited for my dad to notice.

30:11.520 --> 30:13.760
Took about two hours, but he noticed.

30:15.360 --> 30:17.440
I got the whole party in on it.

30:17.440 --> 30:21.360
This guy expectantly staring at this brown lump like,

30:21.360 --> 30:23.920
hey, anybody been to the hallway lately?

30:23.920 --> 30:25.200
It's a little stinky in there

30:25.200 --> 30:27.600
if anybody wants to go into the hallway.

30:27.600 --> 30:29.440
I got the whole party in on it.

30:29.440 --> 30:30.800
The look on my dad's face

30:30.800 --> 30:33.040
when he tried to secretly grab the paper towel

30:33.040 --> 30:36.400
and clean it up before anyone noticed was priceless.

30:36.400 --> 30:38.640
And the moment when he bent down and grabbed it

30:38.640 --> 30:41.200
and realized it was fake was even better.

30:41.920 --> 30:43.680
Touch that shit, old man.

30:43.680 --> 30:44.480
Touch it, dad.

30:44.480 --> 30:46.080
I've waited two hours for this.

30:47.760 --> 30:48.640
The moment's here.

30:48.640 --> 30:48.880
How was the party?

30:48.880 --> 30:50.160
Hey, has anyone seen Doug?

30:50.160 --> 30:52.240
Yeah, he's just staring down the hallway.

30:52.240 --> 30:53.360
Did you have fun at the party?

30:53.360 --> 30:57.440
Yeah, I spent most of it looking at fake shit on the ground.

30:58.480 --> 31:00.720
I know you invited that person that you wanted me to talk to

31:00.720 --> 31:03.760
because you think maybe we could become romantically entwined,

31:03.760 --> 31:04.880
but they did try and talk to me

31:04.880 --> 31:06.400
and I said, not now, not now, not now.

31:06.400 --> 31:08.720
I need to watch my daddy touch this poo-poo.

31:08.720 --> 31:11.280
And he looked like a fool for the five seconds

31:11.280 --> 31:12.960
when he thought it was real.

31:12.960 --> 31:14.080
What a dumb asshole.

31:14.640 --> 31:17.600
Hey, I'm not gonna be able to afford any fake poop

31:17.600 --> 31:20.080
if we don't take a quick break to the Money Zone.

31:20.080 --> 31:35.280
Do you think there was ever a dookie gag of any stripe

31:35.280 --> 31:37.040
on Frasier Prime,

31:37.040 --> 31:38.800
which is what we'll call the first sort of-

31:38.800 --> 31:41.120
They had a dog running around the house

31:41.120 --> 31:42.640
in a fancy apartment.

31:42.640 --> 31:44.560
You know there was, Griffin?

31:44.560 --> 31:44.960
Okay.

31:44.960 --> 31:46.000
This isn't an ad.

31:46.880 --> 31:48.240
Neither of you are doing the ads.

31:48.240 --> 31:49.280
Okay, I'll read it here.

31:49.280 --> 31:50.640
This ad is from Stitch Fix.

31:50.640 --> 31:54.720
Everybody go to Amazon and buy the complete series of Frasier

31:55.680 --> 31:58.320
and think about how all of them would be wearing

31:58.320 --> 31:59.120
comfortable underpants.

31:59.120 --> 32:00.160
He's right.

32:00.160 --> 32:02.560
It says, Stitch Fix says right here,

32:02.560 --> 32:04.160
don't talk about the clothes.

32:04.160 --> 32:06.240
We're warning you, nerdlingers.

32:06.240 --> 32:08.800
Just, we went deep.

32:08.800 --> 32:12.640
It says we went, okay, we went deep on Frasier.

32:13.200 --> 32:14.320
So deep.

32:14.320 --> 32:15.520
God, we're ruined.

32:15.520 --> 32:18.720
Why did we spend all the money we used,

32:18.720 --> 32:22.800
we earned from bringing great style direct to people's doors

32:23.360 --> 32:25.040
with their favorite clothing brands

32:25.040 --> 32:29.120
and shipping out people's boxes of clothes and accessories

32:29.680 --> 32:33.280
and we spent it all on Frasier, baby, and we're sunk.

32:33.280 --> 32:35.920
It says here, we invested in Frasier,

32:35.920 --> 32:39.040
which is not a thing we thought you could do with a TV show,

32:39.040 --> 32:42.000
but we thought they were all about stylish, classy people.

32:42.000 --> 32:44.800
So we thought, what better to associate ourselves with?

32:44.800 --> 32:47.840
And only then did we find out it's not even running anymore.

32:47.840 --> 32:49.600
It says here that to get started,

32:49.600 --> 32:51.280
go to stitchfix.com slash my brother,

32:51.280 --> 32:53.280
answer some questions about your preferred style

32:53.280 --> 32:55.040
and your personal shopper will ship you

32:55.040 --> 32:57.120
a box of clothes, shoes, and accessories.

32:57.120 --> 33:00.240
And that Griffin on his last box kept five out of five things

33:00.880 --> 33:02.800
because they really, really crushed it.

33:02.800 --> 33:05.520
And then it says here that they just called the stock market

33:05.520 --> 33:08.720
and started yelling, Frasier, Frasier, Frasier, Frasier

33:08.720 --> 33:12.160
until they had shares of Frasier here.

33:12.160 --> 33:14.560
And accidentally some of Brendan Frasier too,

33:14.560 --> 33:16.800
but that's actually paying dividends now.

33:16.800 --> 33:20.000
So that's what's going to keep them afloat here in 2020.

33:20.000 --> 33:23.120
Oh, and it says here, shipping, exchanges, returns,

33:23.120 --> 33:24.960
and Niles are always free.

33:25.600 --> 33:28.960
So if you order the Frasier characters,

33:28.960 --> 33:30.080
you get free Niles.

33:30.080 --> 33:30.800
That's nice.

33:30.800 --> 33:34.080
And a $20 styling fee is automatically applied

33:34.080 --> 33:36.000
towards anything you keep from your box.

33:36.000 --> 33:39.120
And a little bit of Roz's hair is going to be in there.

33:39.120 --> 33:39.760
That's weird.

33:39.760 --> 33:40.240
Wow.

33:40.240 --> 33:41.360
Yeah, it is weird.

33:41.360 --> 33:43.520
It says here they've been stockpiling Roz's hair,

33:43.520 --> 33:47.360
genuine Roz's hair for decades, but get started today.

33:47.360 --> 33:51.440
That is stitchfix.com slash my brother.

33:52.000 --> 33:53.920
Stitchfix.com slash my brother.

33:53.920 --> 33:57.200
You get an extra 25% off when you keep everything in your box,

33:57.200 --> 33:59.200
including Niles, and you have to feed him.

33:59.200 --> 34:00.240
You have to feed him.

34:00.240 --> 34:01.600
You absolutely must feed him.

34:01.600 --> 34:03.040
Don't feed him after midnight.

34:03.040 --> 34:05.440
Let's say you're a clothing company that just made

34:05.440 --> 34:07.760
the biggest mistake of your existence.

34:07.760 --> 34:08.800
You're on the ropes.

34:10.080 --> 34:12.000
The bank is on the phone.

34:12.000 --> 34:13.920
They're going to come for everything.

34:13.920 --> 34:16.000
You've got one chance to set it all right,

34:16.000 --> 34:19.680
and that's to sell all of your copies of Frasier on DVD

34:19.680 --> 34:20.800
at a premium price.

34:20.800 --> 34:22.880
I wouldn't even know where to begin, Justin.

34:23.440 --> 34:24.640
I know where you're going to begin.

34:24.640 --> 34:26.560
You're going to begin at Squarespace.

34:26.560 --> 34:26.960
Oh.

34:26.960 --> 34:29.280
It's going to help you showcase your work

34:29.280 --> 34:32.000
or your extensive collection of Frasier DVDs.

34:32.000 --> 34:34.960
And humans and actors from Frasier.

34:35.680 --> 34:38.320
And the sets, the prop replicas.

34:38.320 --> 34:41.680
They can sell products and services of all kinds.

34:42.800 --> 34:47.920
You can promote your physical or online business and more.

34:47.920 --> 34:50.960
They've got beautiful templates created by world-class designers.

34:50.960 --> 34:53.200
Everything's optimized for mobile right out of the box.

34:53.200 --> 34:55.280
They've got analytics that can help you see

34:55.280 --> 34:57.600
how many copies of Frasier you've sold so far.

34:58.240 --> 35:00.560
And nothing to patch or upgrade ever.

35:00.560 --> 35:03.440
They handle all that boring stuff for you.

This week on Bullseye, Lin-Manuel Miranda on His Dark Materials,

35:17.840 --> 35:19.760
hip-hop, and life after Hamilton.

35:19.760 --> 35:21.920
I know it's the first line of my obituary.

35:22.480 --> 35:27.680
So if that line is handled, then what else can I do with my time here?

35:27.680 --> 35:30.800
It's Bullseye for MaximumFun.org and NPR.

35:33.520 --> 35:35.200
How about another question we've only done once?

35:35.200 --> 35:36.480
What the fuck?

35:52.320 --> 35:53.760
This is unlistenable.

35:54.720 --> 35:55.840
I want a munch.

35:55.840 --> 35:56.340
Squad.

35:59.200 --> 36:01.040
I want to munch.

36:01.040 --> 36:01.540
Squad.

36:01.540 --> 36:02.040
Squad.

36:05.060 --> 36:09.300
I'm sorry that allergies or what have you have kept me from-

36:09.300 --> 36:10.180
Really squealing.

36:11.300 --> 36:12.580
I just don't have much in me.

36:12.580 --> 36:19.940
It's like a bassy, extreme more than words take on the munch squad theme song.

36:19.940 --> 36:20.740
It's very depressing.

36:21.540 --> 36:22.900
Now I'll tell you what's not depressing though.

36:23.780 --> 36:26.340
The latest in Gravis and Quick Service dining.

36:26.340 --> 36:32.180
This week's breaking news takes us to a doorstep.

36:32.180 --> 36:35.460
I don't think we've darkened before, but it's one of my favorites

36:35.460 --> 36:40.500
when I'm headed south, headed to the beach at Zaxby's.

36:40.500 --> 36:43.300
Oh, never even heard that word said out loud.

36:43.300 --> 36:48.500
It is both, I believe, a restaurant chain and potentially an alien species.

36:49.780 --> 36:54.100
Yes, when I'm having a Zax attack, I see a doctor,

36:54.100 --> 36:59.700
but he recommends to me usually that I should head into Zaxby's,

36:59.700 --> 37:02.900
which is like a chicken place without the bigotry,

37:02.900 --> 37:05.140
or at least they're better at cloaking.

37:05.140 --> 37:06.020
I have no idea.

37:06.660 --> 37:11.620
But Zaxby's has announced a promotional partnership with Sony Pictures

37:11.620 --> 37:14.260
for its upcoming action adventure film.

37:14.260 --> 37:14.760
Sorry?

37:16.260 --> 37:17.380
Wait, what would you guess?

37:18.100 --> 37:19.380
Chicken attack.

37:19.380 --> 37:20.100
Chicken Sprint.

37:20.100 --> 37:24.500
Chicken, Sony Pictures is making Chicken Sprint,

37:24.500 --> 37:27.780
presumably a spiritual successor to Chicken Run.

37:27.780 --> 37:28.740
Is that what you're suggesting?

37:28.740 --> 37:30.660
No, I'm sorry, Justin, this is actually a prequel to Chicken Run.

37:31.780 --> 37:33.380
The chicken is building up steam.

37:34.420 --> 37:34.920
Griffin?

37:35.700 --> 37:39.620
I mean, let me look at the list of films that this-

37:39.620 --> 37:40.980
That will be too easy.

37:40.980 --> 37:43.300
It's Jumanji, the next level.

37:43.300 --> 37:46.660
Now see, I was gonna say perhaps Sex Tape 2,

37:46.660 --> 37:50.820
or maybe Miracles from Heaven 2, or Goosebumps 3.

37:50.820 --> 37:53.860
Zaxby's, the fast casual fan favorite.

37:53.860 --> 37:57.060
God, these places have a lot of different ways of saying bad.

37:57.060 --> 37:59.300
A lot of fun ways of saying not good.

37:59.300 --> 38:01.700
We've got a cult following here at Zaxby's.

38:01.700 --> 38:06.820
Yeah, this fast casual fan favorite for chicken fingers, wings, and salads.

38:06.820 --> 38:08.260
Don't think so.

38:08.260 --> 38:09.780
On the last one, I don't agree.

38:10.340 --> 38:15.060
Launched its limited time Southwest Chipotle and Smokehouse Cheddar

38:15.060 --> 38:18.820
BBQ Filet Sandwiches.

38:18.820 --> 38:22.100
Can you imagine standing at a fucking register and they're like,

38:22.100 --> 38:23.060
what will you have?

38:23.060 --> 38:29.220
And I'll say, could I have the Southwest Chipotle BBQ Filet Sandwich, please?

38:29.860 --> 38:31.220
It's embarrassing, they need numbers.

38:31.220 --> 38:32.820
Is that the sandwich, Diane?

38:32.820 --> 38:34.660
Because I don't see the connection.

38:35.540 --> 38:38.660
Well, Travis, maybe it'll become more clear to you when you slurp down

38:38.660 --> 38:42.420
an extra extra large Jumanji Citrus Fizz.

38:42.420 --> 38:42.920
Huh.

38:42.920 --> 38:48.120
I don't think if I was a family brand like Zaxby's,

38:48.840 --> 38:54.680
I would make it so easy to say jizz accidentally in my restaurant.

38:54.680 --> 38:57.000
You are basically begging for it.

38:57.000 --> 38:58.280
Jumanji Citrus Fizz.

38:58.280 --> 39:02.520
And here's the thing, there'll be a moment where you accidentally say like Fumanji

39:03.240 --> 39:06.440
and like you'll keep talking, but your brain will be like, oh no.

39:06.440 --> 39:07.800
Can I get a Fumanji?

39:07.800 --> 39:09.160
Oh no, I'm about to say jizz.

39:09.160 --> 39:10.840
I would stop talking.

39:10.840 --> 39:11.560
Can I get a-

39:11.560 --> 39:13.000
Your mouth, quit it, abort.

39:13.000 --> 39:14.120
You're about to say jizz.

39:14.680 --> 39:16.360
Oh boy, I would, I am parched.

39:16.360 --> 39:18.280
I would love a Fumanji jizz mist.

39:18.280 --> 39:20.280
Ah, beans.

39:21.320 --> 39:21.800
Dang it.

39:21.800 --> 39:24.680
Oh, you wanted a Fumanji jizz mist with beans?

39:24.680 --> 39:26.360
Yeah, I may as well.

39:26.360 --> 39:33.000
Yeah, we strive to give our guests exciting flavor options and our new Southwest Chipotle

39:33.000 --> 39:37.000
and classic Smokehouse Cheddar BBQ sandwiches do just that,

39:37.000 --> 39:39.720
says Zaxby's Chief Marketing Officer, Joel Bolger.

39:39.720 --> 39:43.640
Don't you think that there should be a law where if you're going to put a quote

39:44.440 --> 39:51.160
into a document, you must first say the phrase out loud with your human mouth,

39:51.160 --> 39:54.120
or illegally it can't be written down as a quote.

39:54.120 --> 39:56.120
Like Joel actually had to say out loud,

39:56.920 --> 40:01.960
we strive to give our guests exciting flavor options and our new Southwest Chipotle

40:01.960 --> 40:05.480
and classic Smokehouse Cheddar BBQ sandwiches do just that.

40:05.480 --> 40:11.560
Joel then continues the great tradition of Munch Squad providers being defensive in their quotes.

40:12.440 --> 40:17.960
He says, teaming up with Sony Pictures on Jumanji, the next level, just makes sense.

40:17.960 --> 40:20.200
I don't know.

40:21.000 --> 40:25.160
It's like they're doing a Jumanji and we got some new fucking sandwiches and some citrus jizz.

40:25.160 --> 40:25.880
Damn it.

40:25.880 --> 40:26.360
Damn it.

40:26.360 --> 40:27.160
I did it again.

40:27.160 --> 40:32.280
Now Justin, you haven't seen the first Jumanji, well the remake sequel.

40:32.280 --> 40:34.280
I've tried several times.

40:34.280 --> 40:37.640
I've tried several times to watch the second Jumanji.

40:37.640 --> 40:42.760
But you have not reached the point where the rock just barrels that camera and says,

40:42.760 --> 40:45.240
my God, it burns so much, my citrus jizz.

40:46.520 --> 40:48.680
Get it out, get it out, please get it out of me.

40:48.680 --> 40:49.560
What is this horrible curse?

40:49.560 --> 40:59.560
A scorpion got me on my thingy thingy and it's a hot flaming hot Fumanji mist in there.

40:59.560 --> 41:02.840
And I could really use some help here.

41:02.840 --> 41:08.440
I'm going to jump off this cliff so I can respawn and get a new life where my pee pee

41:08.440 --> 41:10.680
isn't like so full of scorpion venom.

41:10.680 --> 41:12.440
I think the sandwiches are too much.

41:12.440 --> 41:18.040
The Southwest Chipotle filet sandwich has hand breaded filet, pickled jalapenos,

41:18.840 --> 41:23.480
pepper jack cheese, spicy chipotle aioli, fresh lettuce and tomato,

41:23.480 --> 41:25.960
all served on a toasted potato bun.

41:25.960 --> 41:26.760
Does that sound good?

41:26.760 --> 41:31.720
I mean, it would rip me into pieces.

41:31.720 --> 41:34.360
Does that sound like a last sandwich worthy of your last sandwich?

41:35.080 --> 41:41.880
It would shred me up and scatter me over the fucking 2020 Democratic National Convention.

41:41.880 --> 41:43.880
Like it would fuck me right up.

41:43.880 --> 41:46.760
But OK, talk about self burns.

41:46.760 --> 41:53.320
This press release by Zaxby's goes on to say these two hand breaded made to order

41:53.320 --> 42:01.560
customizable chicken sandwich meals are fast, casual quality at quick service pace and pricing.

42:01.560 --> 42:03.000
OK, OK.

42:03.000 --> 42:03.720
Wow.

42:03.720 --> 42:04.680
Wow, really?

42:04.680 --> 42:09.960
Hey, listen, we ran for the top and this is like a sandwich you get at Applebee's, my man.

42:09.960 --> 42:11.160
Like there's that right there.

42:11.160 --> 42:11.560
Exactly.

42:11.560 --> 42:12.920
Say like you could get that.

42:12.920 --> 42:16.280
You eat this sandwich and be like, fuck, am I at Applebee's?

42:16.280 --> 42:17.320
Is this at Chili's?

42:17.320 --> 42:18.680
Because this is amazing.

42:19.320 --> 42:21.240
This is fucking so good.

42:21.240 --> 42:26.920
Customers looking for a movie themed drink may try the custom limited time Coca-Cola

42:26.920 --> 42:29.400
freestyle Jumanji citrus fizz.

42:29.960 --> 42:31.560
Also available in white.

42:31.560 --> 42:32.200
Thank God.

42:32.840 --> 42:36.040
Made with the Minute Maid orange and Seagram's ginger ale.

42:36.600 --> 42:39.480
The beverage has a sparkling citrusy orange taste.

42:39.480 --> 42:40.760
I wonder how they get it.

42:40.760 --> 42:43.720
Is it maybe by mixing Minute Maid orange and ginger ale?

42:43.720 --> 42:45.960
You just gave me the fucking recipe.

42:45.960 --> 42:46.840
I'll do it at home.

42:46.840 --> 42:51.240
This is so great because I was really craving a won't you be my neighbor Baja blast, but

42:51.240 --> 42:53.880
it's really great that I don't have to wait for a movie themed drink.

42:55.000 --> 43:00.280
The beverage has a sparkling citrusy orange taste that pairs with either of the new sandwiches.

43:00.280 --> 43:10.440
Oh, the Seagram's ginger ale really helps to push the hard sandwich down my throat.

43:10.440 --> 43:11.160
What an excellent pairing.

43:11.160 --> 43:12.680
It's a perfect pairing.

43:12.680 --> 43:14.680
I'm able to swallow it.

43:14.680 --> 43:22.840
Guests are invited to enjoy the drink in a 42 ounce Jumanji the next level theme commemorative

43:22.840 --> 43:23.080
cup.

43:23.080 --> 43:26.120
I'm going to save this for ever.

43:26.120 --> 43:30.120
You're coming home to live with me in a place of honor Jumanji cup.

43:30.120 --> 43:37.880
Zaxby's broad audience base lines perfectly with the all audience appeal of Jumanji the

43:37.880 --> 43:44.760
next level, but more importantly they strive for creative execution and have done it again

43:44.760 --> 43:48.760
with the spots they created in collaboration with our film.

43:49.640 --> 43:51.800
Says, silence.

43:52.600 --> 43:57.480
I'm going to read this last name exactly as it's written and I don't want a single peep

43:57.480 --> 43:58.200
to interrupt it.

43:59.000 --> 44:01.240
Says Jeffrey, God sick.

44:03.480 --> 44:04.520
God sick.

44:04.520 --> 44:05.880
Munch squad did it.

44:05.880 --> 44:06.520
God sick.

44:07.080 --> 44:07.560
Help.

44:07.560 --> 44:09.880
God, the God is sick.

44:10.600 --> 44:15.000
Executive vice president of brand management and global partnerships for Sony Pictures

44:15.000 --> 44:16.040
motion picture group.

44:17.640 --> 44:19.720
The TV spots are clever and funny.

44:19.720 --> 44:21.480
That's all Jeff's got left.

44:22.600 --> 44:24.760
Jeff's got one thing left.

44:24.760 --> 44:29.240
Hey, I want you to put my entire name and then my insane title and then I'll come back.

44:29.240 --> 44:32.120
I'll spin back around like a one more thing.

44:32.120 --> 44:34.360
The TV spots are clever and funny.

44:34.360 --> 44:35.160
Oh, geez.

44:35.160 --> 44:39.560
Okay, I don't know how much more of this I can take.

44:40.680 --> 44:42.360
That's all of that.

44:42.360 --> 44:44.920
So that's available now so you can go get that shit.

44:44.920 --> 44:47.080
Okay, how about our second question?

44:47.080 --> 44:51.160
I've always been a little insecure of my rather small vocabulary compared to my friends.

44:51.720 --> 44:56.120
For 2019, I bought a word a day calendar with a new word definition to learn.

44:56.680 --> 45:00.680
I'm assuming each day, not the same one over and over again.

45:00.680 --> 45:08.200
I looked at it every day for about all three weeks and then I forgot about it even existing.

45:08.200 --> 45:12.440
I still have it and I'm hesitant to throw it out since I paid real actually money for it

45:12.440 --> 45:16.840
but it hasn't been touched for more than to move it from place to place since mid-January.

45:17.480 --> 45:22.360
I could try it again for 2020 but it lists the day of the week as well as the date

45:22.360 --> 45:26.440
and I wouldn't want to read my word a day calendar until I'd be at Sunday on a Monday

45:26.440 --> 45:27.960
and end up not going into work.

45:27.960 --> 45:30.920
What should I do with my word a day calendar?

45:30.920 --> 45:33.080
That's from Rice M.

45:33.080 --> 45:33.640
Or Reese.

45:34.280 --> 45:35.080
Or Reese.

45:35.080 --> 45:35.560
Probably Reese.

45:35.560 --> 45:36.600
So let's see.

45:36.600 --> 45:41.640
There's, as we're recording this, 10 divided by 41.

45:41.640 --> 45:43.000
Let me do some quick math here.

45:44.440 --> 45:45.800
Do you do math on your dog?

45:46.440 --> 45:46.680
Yeah.

45:47.480 --> 45:48.280
What the fuck?

45:48.280 --> 45:51.000
Is your dog also a quackulator?

45:51.000 --> 45:51.500
Yeah.

45:52.280 --> 45:56.840
Okay, so this has just become an eight word a day calendar.

45:56.840 --> 45:57.240
Okay.

45:57.240 --> 45:58.120
No big deal.

45:58.120 --> 45:59.160
Yeah, you can do that.

45:59.160 --> 46:00.440
Eight words a day?

46:00.440 --> 46:01.000
That's not bad.

46:01.000 --> 46:01.720
You could do that.

46:02.920 --> 46:03.720
Some of them you'll know.

46:03.720 --> 46:04.220
Yes.

46:04.760 --> 46:05.400
You gotta look forward to that.

46:05.400 --> 46:06.360
Some of them you'll know.

46:06.360 --> 46:10.280
You know they throw in a page every like couple weeks or so where it's like,

46:10.280 --> 46:12.520
bus, take it easy today.

46:12.520 --> 46:16.120
Bus is the long car that we all go in.

46:17.960 --> 46:20.360
But then it's gonna get you right back into a long word.

46:20.360 --> 46:21.640
Like hippopotamus.

46:21.640 --> 46:22.280
Yes.

46:22.280 --> 46:22.920
A tuffy.

46:23.800 --> 46:26.200
A tuffy to work into casual conversation.

46:26.200 --> 46:28.600
And yeah, hard day at work.

46:28.600 --> 46:31.400
Hey Derek, yeah, it's like a real hippopotamus out there.

46:32.120 --> 46:34.680
Yeah, did you guys see the bus this morning?

46:36.920 --> 46:40.360
That was like eight hippopotamuses all stacked like end to end, right?

46:41.080 --> 46:42.280
Big one.

46:42.280 --> 46:43.320
Big ones.

46:43.320 --> 46:46.680
Anyway, hypotenuse.

46:46.680 --> 46:47.180
See ya.

46:50.680 --> 46:52.520
Yeah, I mean, I would just start cranking.

46:52.520 --> 46:56.280
I would just pull up to your bedside, just start cranking through.

46:56.280 --> 46:57.480
You gotta see how it ends.

46:58.840 --> 47:02.280
Yeah, I mean, there's probably a through line in there.

47:02.280 --> 47:04.680
I feel like word of the day calendars is cheating though,

47:04.680 --> 47:08.760
because you should just get some, you know, some big old books

47:08.760 --> 47:13.080
and find the words in them like, you know, like old school style.

47:14.280 --> 47:16.840
Like an old book that you don't know and you don't understand it.

47:16.840 --> 47:20.600
And so you read it and cheat on the accelerated reader test on it.

47:20.600 --> 47:22.920
And you pick up a few words from it that way.

47:22.920 --> 47:25.400
I feel like that's a more organic, a more organic.

47:25.400 --> 47:27.960
You pick up the words like treasure, an island.

47:28.680 --> 47:31.960
I learned a lot of words from the accelerated reader test

47:31.960 --> 47:33.720
for Red Badge of Courage, so.

47:35.080 --> 47:36.280
Here's the thing though, Griffin.

47:36.280 --> 47:39.720
I would argue that if this question asker does not have the time

47:40.280 --> 47:42.360
to look at the calendar every day,

47:42.360 --> 47:45.560
probably don't want time to read thick, thick, heavy, yeah.

47:46.600 --> 47:50.360
Yeah, I mean, it's not the biggest book, but it is challenging.

47:50.360 --> 47:54.600
Could you hire someone to yell a word at you every day

47:54.600 --> 47:57.880
that you don't know, like they find you.

47:57.880 --> 47:59.720
Why would they have to yell it?

47:59.720 --> 48:03.640
Well, cause I just assumed that you'd be busy running to the next thing

48:04.360 --> 48:07.400
and they would just like yell a big word at you as you ran by.

48:07.400 --> 48:08.280
Pogritudinous.

48:09.640 --> 48:12.760
That would be cool, except they wouldn't tell you what it means

48:13.480 --> 48:16.760
and it would scare everyone around you and you wouldn't learn.

48:16.760 --> 48:19.320
I just said the word pogritudinous, I don't know what it means.

48:19.320 --> 48:21.000
I think it means beautiful.

48:21.000 --> 48:21.720
Does it?

48:21.720 --> 48:23.080
Cause it sounds kind of gross.

48:23.080 --> 48:25.560
It's the grossest word, but I think it means beautiful.

48:26.200 --> 48:28.040
I don't think you should take on projects like this.

48:28.600 --> 48:30.920
Okay, I don't think you should do this.

48:31.560 --> 48:35.240
We got a puzzle a day calendar last Christmas

48:35.240 --> 48:40.440
and we had a thing where we were writing like a memory,

48:40.440 --> 48:42.360
something that happened that day on the back of it

48:42.360 --> 48:43.960
and then put it into a jar, right?

48:43.960 --> 48:44.840
That's a lot of work.

48:44.840 --> 48:47.080
And then it's like a lot of work, right?

48:47.080 --> 48:49.880
And then it got to May and by the time it got to May,

48:49.880 --> 48:54.360
like fucking life, you know, like life got in the way.

48:55.160 --> 48:57.800
And it's like, what happened to us three weeks ago?

48:57.800 --> 48:58.360
I don't know.

48:59.000 --> 49:03.000
And now we've got this sad jar with like four months of memories

49:03.000 --> 49:05.880
and I literally don't think I will have,

49:05.880 --> 49:07.400
the idea is supposed to be at the end of the year,

49:07.400 --> 49:08.200
you get them all out.

49:08.200 --> 49:09.640
You're like, remember when?

49:09.640 --> 49:11.880
But I don't think I'll have the fucking guts

49:11.880 --> 49:15.480
to face this failed project come December.

49:15.480 --> 49:17.480
I'm gonna look at it and just feel so hollow

49:18.120 --> 49:21.720
about the months and months of unsaved memories.

49:21.720 --> 49:23.000
It's too depressing.

49:23.000 --> 49:24.680
That's why I just live in the moment

49:24.680 --> 49:26.440
and then forget about it.

49:26.440 --> 49:27.320
That's it, move on.

49:28.520 --> 49:30.760
Here's some honest to gosh stuff.

49:30.760 --> 49:34.280
Don't sweat your, you know, narrower vocabulary.

49:35.560 --> 49:37.640
Sure, I know what the word pulchritudinous means.

49:37.640 --> 49:39.160
Like I'm a real fucking mensa

49:39.160 --> 49:41.000
just fucking balling out all the time.

49:41.800 --> 49:43.480
Everyone thinks I'm so cool and smart.

49:43.480 --> 49:46.600
But also that can be insufferable.

49:46.600 --> 49:51.160
And so just don't sweat it, you do you.

49:51.160 --> 49:54.360
Find the words, find the powerful words for you.

49:54.360 --> 49:56.040
If you don't know pulchritudinous,

49:56.040 --> 49:57.560
it's because you've already decided

49:57.560 --> 49:59.080
that that's not a powerful word for you.

49:59.080 --> 50:00.360
You could just say beautiful.

50:00.360 --> 50:03.640
You could just say beautiful or hella pretty.

50:03.640 --> 50:07.320
And that could be, that felt awful coming out of my mouth.

50:07.320 --> 50:12.360
That felt like I just sort of produced slugs out of my tongue

50:12.360 --> 50:15.480
but it might sound super cool coming out of your mouth

50:15.480 --> 50:18.040
if you're like a badass skateboarder or something.

50:18.040 --> 50:19.720
Find your power words.

50:19.720 --> 50:20.680
And here's the thing.

50:20.680 --> 50:23.160
Let me tell you, this is a little Travis McElroy top tip here

50:23.160 --> 50:26.600
and I'm a little bit loathe to give the secret away.

50:26.600 --> 50:28.680
But if someone uses a big word, like Griffin,

50:28.680 --> 50:30.680
say that building is pulchritudinous.

50:31.640 --> 50:33.720
That building is pulchritudinous.

50:33.720 --> 50:35.080
Okay, yeah.

50:36.360 --> 50:39.400
Like, oh, that's cool, I'm like not listening.

50:39.400 --> 50:41.480
No, I'm just saying like you don't have to then like say,

50:41.480 --> 50:43.960
like you don't have to use it in a sentence.

50:43.960 --> 50:44.920
You're an adult.

50:44.920 --> 50:46.680
If someone says something's pulchritudinous

50:46.680 --> 50:48.360
and then you're like, I don't know what that means.

50:48.920 --> 50:50.840
Like you don't have to apologize for that.

50:50.840 --> 50:52.280
You don't even have to acknowledge it

50:52.280 --> 50:53.240
if you don't want to.

50:53.240 --> 50:55.160
You can just say like, okay, whatever.

50:55.160 --> 50:57.080
Anyways, what do you want for lunch?

50:57.080 --> 51:00.280
Like Travis, I know that you feel

51:00.280 --> 51:02.120
like you're being helpful right now

51:02.120 --> 51:04.280
but I assure you that you're not.

51:04.280 --> 51:06.200
I don't know how you've lulled yourself

51:06.200 --> 51:09.560
into a sense of feeling like this is good stuff

51:09.560 --> 51:12.280
that you're coming up with right now, but you're not.

51:12.280 --> 51:13.080
You're not helping.

51:13.080 --> 51:14.520
Play it the other way, my big man.

51:14.520 --> 51:16.600
You tell me a fancy word

51:16.600 --> 51:18.360
and how you would deal with someone saying it to you.

51:18.360 --> 51:20.840
And you give me a fancy word that I don't know.

51:21.480 --> 51:24.520
Let's say I'm looking around Twitter here, not seeing any.

51:24.520 --> 51:25.560
Okay, give me a second one.

51:26.360 --> 51:27.640
Bupropion.

51:27.640 --> 51:28.840
I'm just looking around my desk.

51:28.840 --> 51:31.080
I'm just sort of shooting it off the cuff.

51:32.280 --> 51:33.160
What's that mean?

51:33.160 --> 51:33.960
Bupropion.

51:34.520 --> 51:36.680
Well, if you take one tablet by mouth twice a day,

51:36.680 --> 51:39.880
then it helps sort of the brain troubles the ghosts,

51:40.680 --> 51:42.360
the sort of specters.

51:42.360 --> 51:43.000
Yeah.

51:43.000 --> 51:44.120
Thank you for sharing that with me.

51:44.120 --> 51:45.960
I appreciate you taking the time to do that.

51:45.960 --> 51:48.840
Okay, now do you think that, Griffin,

51:48.840 --> 51:50.680
do you now think that I'm a normal human being

51:50.680 --> 51:52.600
or a fucking sociopath?

51:52.600 --> 51:55.640
I think probably more normal than what Travis.

51:55.640 --> 51:57.720
Okay, that's kind of like a more normal thing.

51:57.720 --> 51:58.680
I'm saying, you know what?

51:58.680 --> 52:00.840
I've got confidence, boys.

52:00.840 --> 52:03.800
I don't need to learn any of your stupid words, all right?

52:03.800 --> 52:06.440
The other possibility is that you say,

52:06.440 --> 52:08.760
oh, that building's so pulchritudinous.

52:08.760 --> 52:11.160
And then you say, what does that mean?

52:11.160 --> 52:14.200
And then they either say, oh, fuck, I don't know.

52:14.200 --> 52:15.800
Or they say the wrong thing.

52:15.800 --> 52:17.960
And congratulations, you've just wandered

52:17.960 --> 52:21.000
into the most delectable scenario imaginable.

52:21.000 --> 52:21.960
Oh, for real?

52:21.960 --> 52:23.160
Oh, but you said it.

52:23.880 --> 52:24.920
Wow, for real though?

52:24.920 --> 52:28.120
Because you said it like a big old English professor.

52:28.120 --> 52:30.920
Like a big smart Egbert, huh?

52:30.920 --> 52:32.200
But you said it.

52:32.200 --> 52:34.120
Shit, interesting.

52:35.160 --> 52:36.840
That's not a power word.

52:36.840 --> 52:38.520
That's a weakness word.

52:38.520 --> 52:39.480
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

52:39.480 --> 52:40.280
Yeah, I'd like that.

52:40.280 --> 52:41.080
We'll do a quick one.

52:41.080 --> 52:42.360
But this one is sent by Catherine.

52:42.360 --> 52:44.520
It's by another anonymous Yahoo Answers user.

52:45.720 --> 52:49.560
I'm gonna call him Jer-bear asks,

52:50.440 --> 52:53.400
my dog jumped at an elderly man on a walk

52:53.400 --> 52:54.920
and made him fall over.

52:54.920 --> 52:57.480
I walked away quickly and didn't look back.

52:57.480 --> 52:58.680
What will happen?

52:58.680 --> 53:01.160
Oh no, wait, who?

53:01.160 --> 53:03.400
Update, don't be funny, he's not dead.

53:03.400 --> 53:05.800
I didn't hear any ambulance in my neighborhood that day.

53:05.800 --> 53:06.520
Oh God.

53:07.800 --> 53:09.400
I don't know exactly where he lives,

53:09.400 --> 53:10.440
but I haven't seen him since.

53:11.000 --> 53:12.680
Update, update three.

53:13.240 --> 53:14.920
It's been three days, I'm all clear.

53:14.920 --> 53:15.960
Thank God I got lucky.

53:17.160 --> 53:17.660
What?

53:18.360 --> 53:19.160
So what happened?

53:19.880 --> 53:21.000
Sorry, I'll start over.

53:21.000 --> 53:23.160
My dog did jump at an elderly man

53:23.160 --> 53:25.000
on a walk and made him fall over.

53:25.000 --> 53:27.240
Not great, not a great start.

53:27.240 --> 53:28.680
Not great, not great.

53:28.680 --> 53:31.080
I walked away quickly and didn't look back.

53:31.080 --> 53:33.960
Not great, pretty not great.

53:35.320 --> 53:36.040
What will happen?

53:37.000 --> 53:38.920
But then three days have passed.

53:38.920 --> 53:40.760
So quote, I'm all clear.

53:40.760 --> 53:42.120
Smiley face emoticon.

53:42.120 --> 53:43.080
Thank God I got lucky.

53:43.080 --> 53:43.800
He's dead.

53:43.800 --> 53:45.000
He's apparently dead.

53:45.000 --> 53:47.320
I'm not being questioned in connection.

53:47.320 --> 53:48.600
Listen, if we go that route,

53:48.600 --> 53:50.200
it's gonna be hard to play in the space.

53:50.200 --> 53:51.880
No ambulances were heard that day.

53:53.480 --> 53:55.640
The question askers sold their dog up the river.

53:56.200 --> 53:57.880
Oh, okay.

53:57.880 --> 54:02.040
Yeah, I told my dog not to jump on the old man.

54:02.040 --> 54:02.920
I said, don't do it.

54:02.920 --> 54:03.960
And he said, I'm gonna do it.

54:03.960 --> 54:05.480
And I said, no, that's wrong.

54:06.280 --> 54:09.800
Yeah, you could say that there was coins

54:10.440 --> 54:11.880
floating above the old man

54:12.440 --> 54:14.200
that your dog was just trying to get him.

54:14.840 --> 54:16.200
And he got bonked.

54:16.760 --> 54:18.280
And there's just no way around it.

54:20.120 --> 54:23.960
The old man was cosplaying as his favorite character

54:23.960 --> 54:28.360
from the upcoming smash hit movie, Cats.

54:29.160 --> 54:30.920
And that made the dog angry

54:30.920 --> 54:32.280
because he hadn't seen it yet

54:32.280 --> 54:34.440
and it felt like it had been spoiled for him.

54:34.440 --> 54:36.440
He's been trying to go in clean.

54:36.440 --> 54:38.520
He's been trying to go into the theater pure.

54:39.160 --> 54:40.440
And that's a shame

54:40.440 --> 54:43.400
because boy, is that dog not gonna like that movie.

54:43.400 --> 54:45.560
This is about a bunch of tall cats, folks.

54:46.680 --> 54:49.160
He's thinking surely it can't be about cats.

54:49.160 --> 54:50.440
Gotta be an ironic name.

54:51.720 --> 54:52.920
They wouldn't be that.

54:52.920 --> 54:55.720
Like they know there's dogs out here trying to see movies.

54:55.720 --> 54:57.560
There's no way it's just about cats.

54:57.560 --> 54:59.240
There's gotta be something we're missing.

54:59.240 --> 55:02.360
How's that, has that old gearbox you got up

55:02.360 --> 55:03.880
locked up in that skull work

55:04.440 --> 55:07.480
that when your dog does jump up on the elderly man

55:07.480 --> 55:11.480
and he does fall down, you just dip?

55:12.760 --> 55:14.360
And don't look back.

55:15.000 --> 55:17.800
The not looking back is also troubling, Travis.

55:18.680 --> 55:20.200
Yeah, very troubling.

55:20.200 --> 55:21.960
I would say what's gonna happen,

55:21.960 --> 55:24.840
you're probably okay here.

55:24.840 --> 55:27.480
I would hope that some sort of judgment,

55:28.520 --> 55:32.760
be it divine or karmic or whatever, awaits you.

55:32.760 --> 55:34.040
But you know what?

55:34.040 --> 55:35.640
It's been three days.

55:36.360 --> 55:36.840
Yeah.

55:36.840 --> 55:37.880
It's probably fine.

55:37.880 --> 55:38.520
But you know what?

55:39.720 --> 55:41.000
The old man knows.

55:42.600 --> 55:43.720
And does he?

55:43.720 --> 55:45.800
Cause it seems like you played it off so well

55:45.800 --> 55:46.920
by walking away.

55:46.920 --> 55:48.600
Yeah, what was that wild dog by itself?

55:48.600 --> 55:51.560
And loudly announcing whose dog is doing this?

55:51.560 --> 55:53.240
Someone please come get this dog.

55:53.240 --> 55:55.000
I see this dog is causing you issue.

55:55.000 --> 55:56.920
I'll grab his leash and take him away.

55:57.560 --> 55:59.480
Or you should, that's why you should always have

55:59.480 --> 56:01.080
a fake mustache in your pocket

56:01.080 --> 56:02.760
so you can walk away very quickly

56:02.760 --> 56:04.840
and then come back with the fake mustache like,

56:04.840 --> 56:07.320
hi, excuse me, is this dog causing you trouble?

56:07.960 --> 56:12.520
Oh no, the dog has bound my wrist with this leash

56:12.520 --> 56:13.880
and it's tugging me along

56:13.880 --> 56:16.360
and I am waiting for him to make poopies and peepees.

56:17.160 --> 56:18.680
I do love him very much.

56:18.680 --> 56:20.120
I forget what I was doing.

56:20.120 --> 56:23.320
I'm sorry about knocking you very over though, old man.

56:23.320 --> 56:24.440
Do you need help?

56:24.440 --> 56:26.440
Whoa, you jumped back up by yourself

56:26.440 --> 56:28.040
cause you're very healthy

56:28.040 --> 56:30.840
and there's nothing to be sad about in this question.

56:30.840 --> 56:32.200
We're having fun in the space.

56:33.080 --> 56:34.040
Here's what I'll just say.

56:34.600 --> 56:35.480
Here's what I'll say.

56:35.480 --> 56:36.680
All right, I'm just gonna say this.

56:37.720 --> 56:40.920
Original Sid, the thing to remember is

56:41.960 --> 56:44.360
there is Sid in this whole man's heart.

56:44.360 --> 56:47.800
And he probably did deserve it

56:47.800 --> 56:51.880
for something he did because all are fallible.

56:52.600 --> 56:56.520
And fallible, it seems like, cause he did do that,

56:56.520 --> 57:00.120
a big one, but he's okay so we can have fun with it.

57:01.240 --> 57:02.440
It's not sad.

57:02.440 --> 57:04.040
It is not sad.

57:04.040 --> 57:05.960
We can't stress this enough.

57:05.960 --> 57:07.960
This is not a sad situation.

57:07.960 --> 57:09.080
Oh, it's from the old man.

57:09.720 --> 57:13.160
Oh, when he fell down, he found $100 on the ground.

57:13.160 --> 57:13.720
Cool.

57:13.720 --> 57:15.000
Oh, that's great.

57:15.000 --> 57:16.920
Oh, it says here, I'm really glad.

57:16.920 --> 57:17.960
Wait, let me scroll down.

57:17.960 --> 57:19.240
Oh, the dog knocked me down.

57:19.800 --> 57:21.560
I'm healthier than I was before.

57:22.280 --> 57:25.320
Huh, I adopted the dog as my son.

57:25.320 --> 57:26.840
Oh shit, ring, ring, ring, ring.

57:26.840 --> 57:28.200
Oh guys, hold on, I got a phone call.

57:28.200 --> 57:28.840
Beep, hello.

57:28.840 --> 57:29.480
Oh, okay.

57:29.480 --> 57:31.800
Hey, it's me, the old dog man.

57:31.800 --> 57:32.840
Hi, old dog man.

57:32.840 --> 57:34.120
How are you feeling?

57:34.120 --> 57:35.160
We're really worried about you.

57:35.160 --> 57:35.720
We can't hear him.

57:35.720 --> 57:36.520
Could you patch him in?

57:37.960 --> 57:39.880
Hey, it's me, the old dog man.

57:39.880 --> 57:40.360
Oh, hey.

57:41.000 --> 57:43.960
Yep, just wanted to say that darn dog did knock me over

57:43.960 --> 57:45.800
and I thought I was gonna go up

57:45.800 --> 57:48.520
and hang out with Jesus and old Rebecca.

57:48.520 --> 57:50.680
And I'll tell you about old Rebecca later.

57:50.680 --> 57:53.320
We don't have that many Skype minutes.

57:54.120 --> 57:57.320
But it's, I fell down right on my fucking sacral iliac

57:57.320 --> 57:59.240
and popped it right back into place, didn't it?

58:00.520 --> 58:00.840
Okay.

58:02.680 --> 58:05.240
Look out, look out, tap dancing stage.

58:05.240 --> 58:06.680
Cause dog man's coming.

58:09.320 --> 58:12.280
Are you gonna perform as dog man?

58:12.280 --> 58:15.000
Will that be your sort of stage identity?

58:15.000 --> 58:17.240
And I'll tell y'all about all my sin.

58:24.680 --> 58:28.520
The first act is him admitting all of his worldly sin.

58:29.160 --> 58:31.160
So by the end of the first act, you're like,

58:31.880 --> 58:35.080
someone please send this old man to the ground.

58:35.080 --> 58:36.760
Dippy tap him all the way.

58:36.760 --> 58:37.640
Goodbye, sin.

58:37.640 --> 58:39.880
Someone please find a fucking dog,

58:39.880 --> 58:45.640
some hero dog, and go please fucking end this old sinful man.

58:52.280 --> 58:53.880
So this has been My Brother, My Brother, Me.

58:53.880 --> 58:54.840
It's an advice show.

58:55.720 --> 58:56.360
We're helping.

58:57.400 --> 58:58.600
This has all helped, hasn't it?

58:58.600 --> 58:59.240
Yep.

58:59.240 --> 59:00.200
I'm glad we could help.

59:02.360 --> 59:05.400
We, we're done touring for the year.

59:06.040 --> 59:08.120
So this is normally where we tell you to come see us,

59:08.120 --> 59:11.080
but we're not gonna be out and about, sadly.

59:11.800 --> 59:12.680
Yeah, for a bit now.

59:12.680 --> 59:17.720
We're taking a bit of a break as Travis and Teresa are expecting.

59:18.280 --> 59:21.560
And so we're just gonna kind of chill on it for, yeah.

59:21.560 --> 59:23.080
Just gonna chill on it for a little bit.

59:23.080 --> 59:24.520
But thanks to everybody who came out.

59:25.400 --> 59:27.560
We got a bunch of stuff at McElroy.family

59:27.560 --> 59:28.840
that you can check out,

59:28.840 --> 59:31.720
even if it's not tickets for our live sort of performances.

59:31.720 --> 59:36.200
So, you know, new stuff every month, throwing them up.

59:36.200 --> 59:38.360
Got candle lights merch in there.

59:38.360 --> 59:39.800
If you want candle lights merch,

59:39.800 --> 59:43.960
got candles and pins and there's no candles,

59:43.960 --> 59:45.160
but there's pictures of candles,

59:45.960 --> 59:48.280
pins, ornaments, all kinds of fun stuff.

59:48.280 --> 59:49.720
Speaking of new stuff,

59:49.720 --> 59:52.920
you can go to TheAdventureZoneComic.com

59:52.920 --> 59:54.040
if you haven't already,

59:54.040 --> 59:57.720
and pre-order The Adventure Zone Balanced Graphic Novel,

59:57.720 --> 01:00:00.600
book three, coming out in July.

01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:01.800
But you can pre-order it now

01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:03.480
and then not have to worry about it again.

01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:05.720
Thanks to John Roderick and The Long Winters

01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:06.680
for the use of our theme song.

01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:09.160
It's a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:13.160
Great album, great tunes and great riffs on that one

01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:14.680
and a super powerful chorus.
