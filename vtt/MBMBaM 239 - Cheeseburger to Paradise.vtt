WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:48.560
Welcome, my brother, my brother, and me, an advice show for the modern era.

00:49.440 --> 00:57.040
On this week's episode, we have a gigantic palette, but there's only one hue that is represented.

00:57.040 --> 01:05.840
And that's right, it's 50 Shades of Grey. Watch, 2015.

01:07.440 --> 01:11.440
Step into my office, said the spider to the guy.

01:11.440 --> 01:14.880
We gotta be. Let me check your references.

01:15.440 --> 01:21.120
At least like you've got a lot of experience. What would you say to 50,000 a year?

01:21.120 --> 01:32.400
50,000 Shades of Grey is more gray than your human mind and your human eyeball cones can possibly even conceive.

01:32.400 --> 01:35.600
Curious about our health benefits?

01:35.600 --> 01:40.400
Here's one benefit, that boner.

01:40.400 --> 01:48.400
Here, let me describe to you one 50,000th of these shades. I'm gonna punch your butt.

01:48.400 --> 01:52.400
Don't punch it, it's so good.

01:52.400 --> 02:00.400
It's a book so nasty that people in the black section of Sherwin-Williams get looks like, oh, you nasty.

02:00.400 --> 02:02.400
Oh, you nasty motherfuckers.

02:02.400 --> 02:04.400
I'm just looking at all the different shades of gray.

02:04.400 --> 02:08.400
This used to be a nice Christian community, Sherwin-Williams.

02:08.400 --> 02:10.400
And you made that one dirty section.

02:10.400 --> 02:12.400
Made a dirty, dirty color.

02:12.400 --> 02:16.400
It's enough to make you turn to your wife and say, let's just go with mauve.

02:16.400 --> 02:26.400
If it sounds like my recordings coming to you exclusively in the right channel of your headphones,

02:26.400 --> 02:32.400
it's because I'm favoring that butt cheek because my other one's so tender and sore from punching.

02:32.400 --> 02:38.400
Mr. Gray, remember last night when you punched my butt?

02:38.400 --> 02:42.400
Yeah, I'm suing you for sexual harassment.

02:42.400 --> 02:46.400
No, you can't check the contract, section B for butts.

02:46.400 --> 02:56.400
That's how I keep it categorized, B section, all butt stuff, including indices J through K, punching.

02:56.400 --> 02:58.400
My inner casual Friday.

02:58.400 --> 03:06.400
My inner goddess awoke to punch his butt, and then he was punching my butt, and then we punched each other's butts back and forth.

03:06.400 --> 03:10.400
You done butt punched the cum right out me.

03:10.400 --> 03:16.400
Sorry, Debra.

03:16.400 --> 03:18.400
Debra, I laughed.

03:18.400 --> 03:20.400
Let me try that take again.

03:20.400 --> 03:24.400
You done butt punched the cum right out me.

03:24.400 --> 03:30.400
We ADR'd in all of Christian Gray's lines, so the real guy doesn't do anything.

03:30.400 --> 03:32.400
It's just the three of us taking turns.

03:32.400 --> 03:34.400
Yeah.

03:34.400 --> 03:36.400
Oh, man.

03:36.400 --> 03:42.400
How many times in the novel does he or she give the other one purple nurples?

03:42.400 --> 03:44.400
How purple are their nurples?

03:44.400 --> 03:50.400
I am the oldest master of your sexual destiny, Justin McElroy.

03:50.400 --> 03:54.400
I'm your middle-est HR representative, Travis McElroy.

03:54.400 --> 03:58.400
I'm Griffin McElroy, the emperor of piss.

03:58.400 --> 04:06.400
Oh, man, I don't know a goddamn thing about this film or book.

04:06.400 --> 04:08.400
I think we are nailing it.

04:08.400 --> 04:10.400
I think we're doing pretty good.

04:10.400 --> 04:14.400
A lot of people described it, they said it was just like pornography.

04:14.400 --> 04:18.400
I don't think those people have seen pornography.

04:18.400 --> 04:20.400
Do they have wet butts?

04:20.400 --> 04:24.400
Because if not, then it's not like the pornography I've seen.

04:24.400 --> 04:28.400
As my wife pointed out, it's probably just a bunch of butts, right?

04:28.400 --> 04:30.400
Butts for days.

04:30.400 --> 04:32.400
Butts on butts on butts.

04:32.400 --> 04:36.400
I made this point to my wife, Rachel.

04:36.400 --> 04:40.400
I feel like when I say the words I'm about to say to you, the audience,

04:40.400 --> 04:42.400
she maybe loves me a little bit less.

04:42.400 --> 04:46.400
I shave a little bit off of the reservoir there.

04:46.400 --> 04:50.400
But that movie can't show penetration.

04:50.400 --> 04:52.400
It just can't show penetration.

04:52.400 --> 04:54.400
It cannot show penetration.

04:54.400 --> 04:56.400
This is the nastiest book ever,

04:56.400 --> 05:00.400
but the movie can't even show a penetration scene.

05:00.400 --> 05:02.400
Any object in any orifice.

05:02.400 --> 05:10.400
At best, it's a softcore, late night, HBO, Cinemax kind of movie.

05:10.400 --> 05:12.400
At worst.

05:12.400 --> 05:16.400
Even that can show the bottom of a ball as it penetrates, possibly.

05:16.400 --> 05:20.400
But just a ball, left or right.

05:20.400 --> 05:22.400
And only the bottom quarter of it.

05:22.400 --> 05:24.400
And I'm saying we're not even going to get that.

05:24.400 --> 05:26.400
So it's a God's damn point.

05:26.400 --> 05:28.400
Just read a book.

05:28.400 --> 05:30.400
Well, don't read that book.

05:30.400 --> 05:32.400
Use your imagination.

05:32.400 --> 05:34.400
Read any other book, honestly.

05:34.400 --> 05:36.400
Watch the pornography of your mind.

05:36.400 --> 05:38.400
I think there's ropes and chains, right?

05:38.400 --> 05:40.400
Slinging hands.

05:40.400 --> 05:42.400
Who's your daddy? Yes, I am.

05:42.400 --> 05:46.400
And a gross misrepresentation of the whole BDSM lifestyle.

05:46.400 --> 05:48.400
But other than that,

05:48.400 --> 05:52.400
one minor thing upon which the entire book is built.

05:52.400 --> 05:54.400
It's a fine read. A breezy read.

05:54.400 --> 05:56.400
Do you think that the BDSM community

05:56.400 --> 05:58.400
reads Fifty Shades of Grey in anger

05:58.400 --> 06:02.400
the way the Wiccan community reads Harry Potter?

06:02.400 --> 06:04.400
Um, yeah.

06:04.400 --> 06:06.400
There's no butt-punching in BDSM.

06:06.400 --> 06:08.400
What are you even saying, Fifty Shades of Grey?

06:08.400 --> 06:10.400
What?

06:10.400 --> 06:12.400
Now all the first-timers are going to come in

06:12.400 --> 06:14.400
and just start punching butts day one.

06:14.400 --> 06:16.400
That's a professional move.

06:16.400 --> 06:18.400
Let's see here.

06:18.400 --> 06:20.400
Hey, Mistress Jasmine,

06:20.400 --> 06:22.400
could you step into my office for a minute?

06:22.400 --> 06:24.400
We've had a lot of complaints.

06:24.400 --> 06:26.400
We're going to have to let you go from the BDSM club.

06:26.400 --> 06:28.400
Yeah.

06:28.400 --> 06:30.400
Why? I punched one butt?

06:30.400 --> 06:34.400
Yeah, but we have a zero-butt-punch strike policy.

06:34.400 --> 06:36.400
I walked into the fuck prison

06:36.400 --> 06:38.400
and just shouted whale on my pee-pee.

06:38.400 --> 06:40.400
That's not allowed?

06:40.400 --> 06:42.400
Okay.

06:42.400 --> 06:44.400
No, that was okay.

06:44.400 --> 06:46.400
I don't think that was the problem.

06:46.400 --> 06:48.400
I can't help myself. I see those cheeks.

06:48.400 --> 06:50.400
They look like little speed bags.

06:50.400 --> 06:52.400
I'm training for the fight.

06:52.400 --> 06:54.400
I got a fight coming up.

06:54.400 --> 06:56.400
Uh, Mike's son is about to lose his first tooth.

06:56.400 --> 06:58.400
Oh, on this show, it's like questions and stuff.

06:58.400 --> 07:00.400
My son is about to lose his first tooth.

07:00.400 --> 07:02.400
His best friend received $100 goddamn dollars

07:02.400 --> 07:04.400
from the tooth fairy,

07:04.400 --> 07:06.400
and my son seems to think that amount is normal.

07:06.400 --> 07:08.400
How do I manage his expectations

07:08.400 --> 07:10.400
without losing the magic?

07:10.400 --> 07:12.400
And that's from Dentally Injured

07:12.400 --> 07:14.400
in Delaware.

07:14.400 --> 07:16.400
Here's the point I'll make,

07:16.400 --> 07:18.400
and I know I'm coming at this from an adult

07:18.400 --> 07:20.400
who is, at best, tooth fairy agnostic.

07:20.400 --> 07:22.400
Mm-hmm.

07:22.400 --> 07:24.400
I'm not tooth fairy theistic.

07:24.400 --> 07:26.400
I think the truth is out there somewhere.

07:26.400 --> 07:28.400
But I'm just not willing to commit

07:28.400 --> 07:30.400
one way or the other.

07:30.400 --> 07:32.400
If I had to choose

07:32.400 --> 07:34.400
between losing a tooth

07:34.400 --> 07:36.400
or paying $100,

07:36.400 --> 07:38.400
I would pay $100 every time.

07:38.400 --> 07:40.400
It's not even a question.

07:40.400 --> 07:42.400
Each of my teeth,

07:42.400 --> 07:44.400
I have currently in my head,

07:44.400 --> 07:46.400
let me do some quick math,

07:46.400 --> 07:48.400
probably $3,000 worth of teeth

07:48.400 --> 07:50.400
going for me.

07:50.400 --> 07:52.400
This seems about right.

07:52.400 --> 07:54.400
I got about 30 teeth up in there.

07:54.400 --> 07:56.400
That sounds right.

07:56.400 --> 07:58.400
Let me count them real quick.

07:58.400 --> 08:00.400
That would be real good radio.

08:00.400 --> 08:02.400
I have about $3,000 worth of beautiful enamel

08:02.400 --> 08:04.400
in my mouth,

08:04.400 --> 08:06.400
and I'm not willing to trade any of that for $100.

08:06.400 --> 08:08.400
Now, I'm doing fairly well for myself these days.

08:08.400 --> 08:10.400
If I was in Hot Dog's era,

08:10.400 --> 08:12.400
I would have gone to the tooth bank

08:12.400 --> 08:14.400
and just started swapping those bad boys out.

08:14.400 --> 08:16.400
Griffin, you know that the deal with the tooth fairy

08:16.400 --> 08:18.400
isn't that you're buying the teeth from the child, right?

08:18.400 --> 08:20.400
You're not saying,

08:20.400 --> 08:22.400
hey, Tim, pull it out.

08:22.400 --> 08:24.400
No, I'm just saying if we're looking for a way

08:24.400 --> 08:26.400
to establish value, all right.

08:26.400 --> 08:28.400
Losing your teeth is the worst.

08:28.400 --> 08:30.400
It's the nightmare I have most commonly

08:30.400 --> 08:32.400
is the tooth losing nightmare.

08:32.400 --> 08:34.400
I think a lot of people can relate to that.

08:34.400 --> 08:36.400
How much money would you spend

08:36.400 --> 08:38.400
on leaving your mouth?

08:38.400 --> 08:40.400
Yeah, that's a toughie, right?

08:40.400 --> 08:42.400
I don't know what that figure,

08:42.400 --> 08:44.400
I don't know what that's worth.

08:44.400 --> 08:46.400
It's definitely more than $1,500

08:46.400 --> 08:48.400
to replace a tooth in my mouth.

08:48.400 --> 08:50.400
Yeah, now we're talking,

08:50.400 --> 08:52.400
if we're going into the medical community,

08:52.400 --> 08:54.400
each tooth could arguably be worth

08:54.400 --> 08:56.400
anywhere between $800 to $20,000.

08:56.400 --> 08:58.400
I feel like we're ignoring

08:58.400 --> 09:00.400
something about this question,

09:00.400 --> 09:02.400
and that is that

09:02.400 --> 09:04.400
kids

09:04.400 --> 09:06.400
lie all the time constantly.

09:06.400 --> 09:08.400
They're never not lying.

09:08.400 --> 09:10.400
They're 100% lying forever.

09:10.400 --> 09:12.400
No question.

09:12.400 --> 09:14.400
Call this kid's family.

09:14.400 --> 09:16.400
Guarantee they didn't even know he lost a tooth.

09:16.400 --> 09:18.400
Let me pitch this scenario

09:18.400 --> 09:20.400
to you though, Justin.

09:20.400 --> 09:22.400
Hey, Debra,

09:22.400 --> 09:24.400
you grabbed that tooth from under Timmy's pillow,

09:24.400 --> 09:26.400
and you put a dollar.

09:26.400 --> 09:28.400
Yeah, I just grabbed a dollar out of your wallet,

09:28.400 --> 09:30.400
but I didn't have any dollars in my wallet.

09:30.400 --> 09:32.400
I just hit the bank.

09:32.400 --> 09:34.400
Oh, shit.

09:34.400 --> 09:36.400
Actually, I just saw one,

09:36.400 --> 09:38.400
and I was like, let's just go with it.

09:38.400 --> 09:40.400
I just grabbed a bill,

09:40.400 --> 09:42.400
because who keeps $100 bills in their wallet, Steve?

09:42.400 --> 09:44.400
This is why we have money troubles.

09:44.400 --> 09:46.400
Justin, this is something that you're going to run into

09:46.400 --> 09:48.400
eventually with your spawn,

09:48.400 --> 09:50.400
your brood.

09:50.400 --> 09:52.400
I think $1 for a tooth,

09:52.400 --> 09:54.400
even a child's tiny,

09:54.400 --> 09:56.400
insignificant, bullshit tooth

09:56.400 --> 09:58.400
that can't do much chewing of anything in any way,

09:58.400 --> 10:00.400
I think $1 is garbage.

10:00.400 --> 10:02.400
First of all,

10:02.400 --> 10:04.400
inflation, crazy.

10:04.400 --> 10:06.400
Inflation would be crazy right now, you guys.

10:06.400 --> 10:08.400
$1 isn't going to buy you anything.

10:08.400 --> 10:10.400
It's not even going to buy you an issue of Us Weekly.

10:12.400 --> 10:14.400
I think you're making a fair point.

10:14.400 --> 10:16.400
I don't really see that it's up to me,

10:16.400 --> 10:18.400
but I think it's a fine point you're making.

10:18.400 --> 10:20.400
I'm just saying,

10:20.400 --> 10:22.400
at the very least, $5,

10:22.400 --> 10:24.400
and then at least the child...

10:24.400 --> 10:26.400
But how would I weigh into that decision?

10:26.400 --> 10:28.400
How would I weigh into that decision at all?

10:28.400 --> 10:30.400
The tooth fairy comes to you and says,

10:30.400 --> 10:32.400
what denomination of currency?

10:32.400 --> 10:34.400
Where are you at economically?

10:34.400 --> 10:36.400
They want to make sure

10:36.400 --> 10:38.400
they just keep it within...

10:38.400 --> 10:40.400
They don't want to make the kid richer than me

10:40.400 --> 10:42.400
at that particular moment.

10:42.400 --> 10:44.400
Yeah, because then they become the parent.

10:44.400 --> 10:46.400
That's the law!

10:46.400 --> 10:48.400
Why do you think that Britney Spears' parents

10:48.400 --> 10:50.400
just fucking robbed her blind?

10:50.400 --> 10:52.400
Justin Bieber just got robbed blind?

10:52.400 --> 10:54.400
It's because none of these parents

10:54.400 --> 10:56.400
want to be the children.

10:56.400 --> 10:58.400
Right, and that's what happens.

10:58.400 --> 11:00.400
That's what that Head Start thing you hear so much about?

11:00.400 --> 11:02.400
That's what it is.

11:02.400 --> 11:04.400
It's a parental swap-a-rooney.

11:04.400 --> 11:06.400
It's a freaky Friday,

11:06.400 --> 11:08.400
but it's been codified into a business.

11:08.400 --> 11:10.400
I have a suggestion for the question asker.

11:10.400 --> 11:12.400
Go.

11:12.400 --> 11:14.400
Instead of money,

11:14.400 --> 11:16.400
swap it for some kind of good,

11:16.400 --> 11:18.400
like maybe a new Xbox game

11:18.400 --> 11:20.400
that costs less than $100.

11:20.400 --> 11:22.400
That's awesome.

11:22.400 --> 11:24.400
But in a child's mind...

11:24.400 --> 11:26.400
It might as well cost $10,000.

11:26.400 --> 11:28.400
Yeah, like, oh, I got something.

11:28.400 --> 11:30.400
That's way better.

11:30.400 --> 11:32.400
That's a really good idea.

11:32.400 --> 11:34.400
$60 for a new AAA video game

11:34.400 --> 11:36.400
is still a crazy amount of money to spend.

11:36.400 --> 11:38.400
But I'm saying you could pick up

11:38.400 --> 11:40.400
a certified pre-owned game.

11:40.400 --> 11:42.400
Oh, great.

11:42.400 --> 11:44.400
Thanks, Madden 96

11:44.400 --> 11:46.400
for the original PlayStation.

11:46.400 --> 11:48.400
Oh, this is great.

11:48.400 --> 11:50.400
I love how it has eight different stickers on it.

11:50.400 --> 11:52.400
Thanks, GameStop.

11:52.400 --> 11:54.400
You're a really good company.

11:54.400 --> 11:56.400
Oh, and it smells like weed, and that's fun.

11:56.400 --> 11:58.400
Madden 96, who was even playing football back there?

11:58.400 --> 12:00.400
Is that Deon Sanders on the cover?

12:00.400 --> 12:02.400
Is that Deon?

12:02.400 --> 12:04.400
Okay, I mean, I guess I wasn't alive

12:04.400 --> 12:06.400
when Deon Sanders existed,

12:06.400 --> 12:08.400
but that's totally...

12:08.400 --> 12:10.400
Why does it say on the back

12:10.400 --> 12:12.400
Bow Nose Tackling Fidelity?

12:12.400 --> 12:14.400
I don't understand.

12:14.400 --> 12:16.400
How old would you say is the average kid

12:16.400 --> 12:18.400
who's losing teeth and swapping them with the tooth fairy?

12:18.400 --> 12:20.400
Like seven?

12:20.400 --> 12:22.400
I should learn this.

12:22.400 --> 12:24.400
Is that like seven?

12:24.400 --> 12:26.400
I feel like five to ten is really the sweet spot

12:26.400 --> 12:28.400
where all the goddamn teeth fall out of your head.

12:28.400 --> 12:30.400
Childhood is the worst.

12:30.400 --> 12:32.400
Because I feel like

12:32.400 --> 12:34.400
maybe he's going to lose sight of the fact

12:34.400 --> 12:36.400
that his friend got 100 bucks

12:36.400 --> 12:38.400
by the time he gets like a 20.

12:38.400 --> 12:40.400
Yeah, or he'll lose sight of it

12:40.400 --> 12:42.400
when the parents of the $100 child

12:42.400 --> 12:44.400
go completely broke.

12:44.400 --> 12:46.400
They could go completely bankrupt.

12:46.400 --> 12:48.400
Because they're going to spend $30,000.

12:48.400 --> 12:50.400
Well, $3,600 if they keep it up.

12:50.400 --> 12:52.400
I would like to suggest

12:52.400 --> 12:54.400
that if you are leaving $100,

12:54.400 --> 12:56.400
there is no amount of like being rich

12:56.400 --> 12:58.400
where you would think that is a good idea.

12:58.400 --> 13:00.400
I would like to suggest

13:00.400 --> 13:02.400
that if you are leaving $100

13:02.400 --> 13:04.400
under a child's pillow

13:04.400 --> 13:06.400
for a tooth,

13:06.400 --> 13:08.400
there is only one logical reason

13:08.400 --> 13:10.400
that you are leaving $100

13:10.400 --> 13:12.400
and that is only one logical reason

13:12.400 --> 13:14.400
that would be happening

13:14.400 --> 13:16.400
and that is money laundering.

13:16.400 --> 13:18.400
You are trying to launder a large sum of money

13:18.400 --> 13:20.400
through your child's mouth

13:20.400 --> 13:22.400
so the federales can't get their grow units on it.

13:22.400 --> 13:24.400
It's also,

13:24.400 --> 13:26.400
I would pitch another scenario

13:26.400 --> 13:28.400
that this kid's parents

13:28.400 --> 13:30.400
forgot to swap the tooth

13:30.400 --> 13:32.400
like the last three times.

13:32.400 --> 13:34.400
Oh, I see.

13:34.400 --> 13:36.400
We got to do something big for this one

13:36.400 --> 13:38.400
or he's going to stop believing.

13:38.400 --> 13:40.400
Well,

13:40.400 --> 13:42.400
I'm glad we could talk about that

13:42.400 --> 13:44.400
instead of my thing.

13:44.400 --> 13:46.400
I was saying that they are equally likely.

13:46.400 --> 13:48.400
I thought they were honestly,

13:48.400 --> 13:50.400
I mean, if I was running

13:50.400 --> 13:52.400
a chuckle school, I would say

13:52.400 --> 13:54.400
the concept of

13:54.400 --> 13:56.400
forgetful parents versus money laundering.

13:56.400 --> 13:58.400
Money laundering.

13:58.400 --> 14:00.400
Maybe more comedy.

14:00.400 --> 14:02.400
Oh, you want to interrupt to get that?

14:02.400 --> 14:04.400
Yeah, cool. Like what do you got now?

14:04.400 --> 14:06.400
What do you got now, Keratop?

14:06.400 --> 14:08.400
I got your chocolate and my peanut butter.

14:08.400 --> 14:10.400
I got my peanut butter and your chocolate.

14:10.400 --> 14:12.400
They're forgetful money laundering parents.

14:12.400 --> 14:14.400
Did we launder that money?

14:14.400 --> 14:16.400
Ah, we're in jail. Fuck.

14:16.400 --> 14:18.400
We were supposed to launder $10 each time.

14:18.400 --> 14:20.400
We'll just do $100. No one will notice.

14:20.400 --> 14:22.400
Surely he won't tell the kids at school.

14:22.400 --> 14:24.400
Where do we put the books we've been keeping

14:24.400 --> 14:26.400
for the mob? I don't even know.

14:26.400 --> 14:28.400
Fuck.

14:28.400 --> 14:30.400
Which mob are we in?

14:30.400 --> 14:32.400
I'm so shitty at this.

14:32.400 --> 14:34.400
Are we in your mob?

14:34.400 --> 14:36.400
Sorry, sorry. I know this is awkward.

14:36.400 --> 14:38.400
Are we in the Scarface mob

14:38.400 --> 14:40.400
or the Japanese mob?

14:40.400 --> 14:42.400
Are we Yakuza?

14:42.400 --> 14:44.400
Honey, are we Yakuza?

14:44.400 --> 14:46.400
Are we supposed to be putting Yakuza money

14:46.400 --> 14:48.400
in Dylan's mouth?

14:48.400 --> 14:50.400
Is this ornate dragon on my back

14:50.400 --> 14:52.400
a gang thing?

14:52.400 --> 14:54.400
I just love dragons.

14:54.400 --> 14:56.400
Is there a rumble tonight or is that tomorrow?

14:56.400 --> 14:58.400
Did we miss it?

14:58.400 --> 15:00.400
Honey, I just broke a pool cue

15:00.400 --> 15:02.400
over my knee and God help me

15:02.400 --> 15:04.400
if I could remember what I was going to do with it.

15:04.400 --> 15:06.400
That was our last good pool cue.

15:06.400 --> 15:08.400
The other ones are all warped and bent.

15:08.400 --> 15:10.400
If only we hadn't spent all that money

15:10.400 --> 15:12.400
laundering it for our child

15:12.400 --> 15:14.400
and the two fairies.

15:14.400 --> 15:16.400
Honey, you put the actual money in the laundry.

15:16.400 --> 15:18.400
No.

15:18.400 --> 15:20.400
This is bad.

15:20.400 --> 15:22.400
Now this is like the Amelia Bedelia school

15:22.400 --> 15:24.400
of mafioso life.

15:24.400 --> 15:26.400
You're such a scatterbrained mafioso.

15:26.400 --> 15:28.400
You're supposed to put dates in the pudding

15:28.400 --> 15:30.400
so you cut up a calendar.

15:30.400 --> 15:32.400
You're Amelia Bedelia.

15:34.400 --> 15:36.400
Amelia Bedelia Corleone.

15:36.400 --> 15:38.400
You don't know nothing about money laundering.

15:38.400 --> 15:40.400
You dummy.

15:40.400 --> 15:42.400
Y'all want a yahoo?

15:42.400 --> 15:44.400
Let's just take a quick moment

15:44.400 --> 15:46.400
and take our game and recognize

15:46.400 --> 15:48.400
the game of Rachel Sperling.

15:48.400 --> 15:50.400
Thank you Rachel Sperling.

15:50.400 --> 15:52.400
Rachel Sperling who was at the

15:52.400 --> 15:54.400
San Francisco live show.

15:54.400 --> 15:56.400
It was basically a celebrity.

15:56.400 --> 15:58.400
We got a bunch of emails and tweets

15:58.400 --> 16:00.400
from Rachel Sperling.

16:00.400 --> 16:02.400
And Davenport was there.

16:02.400 --> 16:04.400
My boy D. Big D.

16:04.400 --> 16:06.400
They fought.

16:06.400 --> 16:08.400
The ground shook.

16:08.400 --> 16:10.400
And San Francisco's not there anymore.

16:10.400 --> 16:12.400
Just because there was a flurry of blows

16:12.400 --> 16:14.400
exchanged between them.

16:14.400 --> 16:16.400
Thank you Rachel Sperling.

16:16.400 --> 16:18.400
It's by yahoo answers user Jacob who asks

16:18.400 --> 16:20.400
how can you dominate

16:20.400 --> 16:22.400
each zodiac sign?

16:22.400 --> 16:24.400
What is every zodiac's weakness?

16:24.400 --> 16:26.400
I just want to know

16:26.400 --> 16:28.400
how can you dominate very zodiac sign

16:28.400 --> 16:30.400
in a friendship type of way?

16:30.400 --> 16:32.400
How do you become dominant in a relationship

16:32.400 --> 16:34.400
with any zodiac, especially

16:34.400 --> 16:36.400
Geminis? I would also

16:36.400 --> 16:38.400
like to know what every zodiac sign's

16:38.400 --> 16:40.400
weakness is emotionally and

16:40.400 --> 16:42.400
mentally.

16:42.400 --> 16:44.400
Here's some Fifty Shades shit

16:44.400 --> 16:46.400
isn't it? Okay so

16:46.400 --> 16:48.400
wait hold on. Is this dude looking

16:48.400 --> 16:50.400
for something that's like oh if you make eye

16:50.400 --> 16:52.400
contact with a Scorpio they're yours forever.

16:52.400 --> 16:54.400
And that's right Travis. If you make

16:54.400 --> 16:56.400
eye contact with a Scorpio usually it's hard

16:56.400 --> 16:58.400
to do because Scorpios are trained to just

16:58.400 --> 17:00.400
sort of look into the

17:00.400 --> 17:02.400
middle distance.

17:02.400 --> 17:04.400
They will look intently

17:04.400 --> 17:06.400
at a chin or nose but never in the eyes.

17:06.400 --> 17:08.400
But if you can trick one of them into doing it

17:08.400 --> 17:10.400
their soul is

17:10.400 --> 17:12.400
legally your property.

17:12.400 --> 17:14.400
So that's what Scorpios are all about. That was very

17:14.400 --> 17:16.400
astute Travis and I didn't know that you were

17:16.400 --> 17:18.400
a student of the stars.

17:18.400 --> 17:20.400
I only know one other one.

17:20.400 --> 17:22.400
What's that? It's Aquarius.

17:22.400 --> 17:24.400
If you squeeze their right pinky finger

17:24.400 --> 17:26.400
short squeeze, short squeeze, long

17:26.400 --> 17:28.400
squeeze, short squeeze, short squeeze,

17:28.400 --> 17:30.400
short squeeze. Just bang out the Konami

17:30.400 --> 17:32.400
code on their digits

17:32.400 --> 17:34.400
and then what does that do?

17:34.400 --> 17:36.400
That means

17:36.400 --> 17:38.400
that they owe you five dollars every day

17:38.400 --> 17:40.400
for the rest of their lives. And you do that

17:40.400 --> 17:42.400
to enough Aquarii.

17:42.400 --> 17:44.400
You got a little cottage industry.

17:44.400 --> 17:46.400
Yeah you're set. You're good to go.

17:46.400 --> 17:48.400
Cancers they actually

17:48.400 --> 17:50.400
have a glowing weak point on their belly.

17:50.400 --> 17:52.400
That one's easy.

17:52.400 --> 17:54.400
If you punch that then they void their

17:54.400 --> 17:56.400
bowels.

17:56.400 --> 17:58.400
And you've got that on them.

17:58.400 --> 18:00.400
You punch that it flips them over.

18:00.400 --> 18:02.400
They kind of lie there on their back like

18:02.400 --> 18:04.400
and then you want to use a

18:04.400 --> 18:06.400
Deku nut. If you use the Deku

18:06.400 --> 18:08.400
nut it stuns them.

18:08.400 --> 18:10.400
Right.

18:10.400 --> 18:12.400
Taurus.

18:12.400 --> 18:14.400
I mean just stop

18:14.400 --> 18:16.400
giving it gas I guess.

18:16.400 --> 18:20.400
Low MPG.

18:20.400 --> 18:22.400
It should put a stop to it.

18:22.400 --> 18:24.400
Uh huh.

18:24.400 --> 18:26.400
Also if you just sort of take grab their

18:26.400 --> 18:28.400
horns then you can just like fucking

18:28.400 --> 18:30.400
flip them right over. They can't do anything.

18:30.400 --> 18:32.400
It's like grabbing a cat by the scruff

18:32.400 --> 18:34.400
of its neck. And then there's

18:34.400 --> 18:36.400
the monkey. No.

18:36.400 --> 18:38.400
They're weak against fire.

18:38.400 --> 18:40.400
No. No. No.

18:40.400 --> 18:42.400
Bulbasaur

18:42.400 --> 18:44.400
is weak against fire and

18:44.400 --> 18:46.400
bird types.

18:46.400 --> 18:48.400
So.

18:48.400 --> 18:50.400
God you're being

18:50.400 --> 18:52.400
such a. You're acting like a real Bulbasaur

18:52.400 --> 18:54.400
right now.

18:54.400 --> 18:56.400
I know you're a Taurus but um

18:56.400 --> 18:58.400
I'm in Aries and

18:58.400 --> 19:00.400
as far as I know I don't really have any

19:00.400 --> 19:02.400
weaknesses.

19:02.400 --> 19:04.400
If that's your weakness you're hubris.

19:04.400 --> 19:06.400
Yeah I guess that's true. If there's a movie with a robot in it

19:06.400 --> 19:08.400
and something bad happens to the robot

19:08.400 --> 19:10.400
I'll cry for three and a half

19:10.400 --> 19:12.400
weeks. That's a big issue.

19:12.400 --> 19:14.400
That's a big one for me. Hey Griffin

19:14.400 --> 19:16.400
are you going to go see Big Hero 6? I don't think I will.

19:16.400 --> 19:18.400
Thank you because I have plans next

19:18.400 --> 19:20.400
Friday.

19:20.400 --> 19:22.400
I don't want to still be crying. I don't want to still be crying

19:22.400 --> 19:24.400
about Big Hero 6.

19:24.400 --> 19:26.400
Pisces. Their weak point

19:26.400 --> 19:28.400
is the heart. You gotta stab them in it.

19:28.400 --> 19:30.400
Oh God.

19:30.400 --> 19:32.400
Okay well I think that would work for most of them.

19:32.400 --> 19:34.400
Not so much an emotional mental weakness.

19:34.400 --> 19:36.400
I'm pretty sure everyone's weak in their heart.

19:36.400 --> 19:38.400
No but Pisces

19:38.400 --> 19:40.400
are especially weak.

19:40.400 --> 19:42.400
Like here on your sexual contract you've written

19:42.400 --> 19:44.400
down don't stab my heart.

19:44.400 --> 19:46.400
And I have to be honest I wasn't planning on

19:46.400 --> 19:48.400
doing that but I guess it's good to have a balance.

19:48.400 --> 19:50.400
But now super curious.

19:50.400 --> 19:52.400
I just want to say that I love the

19:52.400 --> 19:54.400
context of this question more than anything.

19:54.400 --> 19:56.400
I love it.

19:56.400 --> 19:58.400
I love that there's a guy sitting there going like

19:58.400 --> 20:00.400
I just want to be friends with everyone.

20:00.400 --> 20:02.400
So how can I dominate them?

20:02.400 --> 20:04.400
Well you can't. You know what demands

20:04.400 --> 20:06.400
you can't be friends with somebody

20:06.400 --> 20:08.400
until they're just fucking

20:08.400 --> 20:10.400
terrified of you.

20:10.400 --> 20:12.400
It's called the Biff School

20:12.400 --> 20:14.400
of making friends.

20:14.400 --> 20:16.400
You really have to terrorize them

20:16.400 --> 20:18.400
into being your buddy.

20:18.400 --> 20:20.400
Justin you have just broken my heart in twain.

20:20.400 --> 20:22.400
This idea

20:22.400 --> 20:24.400
that the plot of

20:24.400 --> 20:26.400
Back to the Future is really about

20:26.400 --> 20:28.400
lonely lonely Biff.

20:28.400 --> 20:30.400
McFly!

20:30.400 --> 20:32.400
McFly what are you a cancer?

20:32.400 --> 20:34.400
Come here. I'm gonna punch your tummy.

20:34.400 --> 20:36.400
You find that

20:36.400 --> 20:38.400
weak point. What if in the

20:38.400 --> 20:40.400
moment when George McFly stood up to Biff

20:40.400 --> 20:42.400
Biff was just heartbroken like

20:42.400 --> 20:44.400
but I thought we were friends.

20:44.400 --> 20:46.400
This is just us right?

20:46.400 --> 20:48.400
I give you a hard time

20:48.400 --> 20:50.400
and you're kind of a dork but like

20:50.400 --> 20:52.400
Geminis of course their only weak point is being covered

20:52.400 --> 20:54.400
in manure. It's the only way to kill

20:54.400 --> 20:56.400
one. It

20:56.400 --> 20:58.400
nullifies their regenerative

20:58.400 --> 21:00.400
process.

21:00.400 --> 21:02.400
Cause there's two of them.

21:02.400 --> 21:04.400
And also if you kill

21:04.400 --> 21:06.400
one with manure it ripples back

21:06.400 --> 21:08.400
through their bloodline and kills

21:08.400 --> 21:10.400
all of the past versions of them with

21:10.400 --> 21:12.400
manure as well.

21:12.400 --> 21:14.400
If you wanted to do it scientifically

21:14.400 --> 21:16.400
you could kill the past one and it would ripple forward.

21:16.400 --> 21:18.400
That's a much easier chronic.

21:18.400 --> 21:20.400
Makes a lot more sense.

21:20.400 --> 21:22.400
Man.

21:22.400 --> 21:24.400
Just now thinking about that.

21:24.400 --> 21:26.400
If Marty McFly had just sort of

21:26.400 --> 21:28.400
murdered

21:28.400 --> 21:30.400
what's his face? Mad Bill Hickok.

21:30.400 --> 21:32.400
What was it? Mad Dog Tannen.

21:32.400 --> 21:34.400
Mad Dog Tannen shot him

21:34.400 --> 21:36.400
right in the dome.

21:36.400 --> 21:38.400
Or covered him in

21:38.400 --> 21:40.400
manure and then shot him.

21:40.400 --> 21:42.400
Or else there's no fucking.

21:42.400 --> 21:44.400
Well it's the only way.

21:44.400 --> 21:46.400
It's the only way to ensure that the job gets done.

21:46.400 --> 21:48.400
Covered him in manure and shoot him.

21:48.400 --> 21:50.400
And then that pretty much takes care of

21:50.400 --> 21:52.400
well just about everything huh?

21:52.400 --> 21:54.400
That wraps

21:54.400 --> 21:56.400
up the series I guess.

21:56.400 --> 21:58.400
Do you guys want to do?

21:58.400 --> 22:00.400
Should we do Future 4? I don't think we can.

22:00.400 --> 22:02.400
Because there is no

22:02.400 --> 22:04.400
friction there. We murdered

22:04.400 --> 22:06.400
all BIFs. Past, Present and Future.

22:08.400 --> 22:10.400
The BIFpocalypse.

22:10.400 --> 22:12.400
What if the fourth one is

22:12.400 --> 22:14.400
they realized they needed at least one BIF

22:14.400 --> 22:16.400
to like save the world.

22:16.400 --> 22:18.400
And you have to go dig

22:18.400 --> 22:20.400
back. Dig BIF out of

22:20.400 --> 22:22.400
the poop before it gets shot.

22:22.400 --> 22:24.400
If it gets shot it's fine. Don't worry about it.

22:24.400 --> 22:26.400
No you have to go shoot yourself

22:26.400 --> 22:28.400
before you shoot BIF.

22:28.400 --> 22:30.400
You are the gunman on the grassy

22:30.400 --> 22:32.400
noble. You are the third

22:32.400 --> 22:34.400
man. You are the one

22:34.400 --> 22:36.400
who has to bring yourself down before you shoot.

22:36.400 --> 22:38.400
Back into the future.

22:38.400 --> 22:40.400
Back into the future.

22:42.400 --> 22:44.400
Solid.

22:44.400 --> 22:46.400
Thank you. Thank you. Delicious.

22:46.400 --> 22:48.400
Next question.

22:48.400 --> 22:50.400
Let's see. We got one here.

22:50.400 --> 22:52.400
I'm going with my wife

22:52.400 --> 22:54.400
and a part of her family on a rather expensive

22:54.400 --> 22:56.400
trip to Ful which has been

22:56.400 --> 22:58.400
planned. Florida.

22:58.400 --> 23:00.400
Florida.

23:00.400 --> 23:02.400
Which has been planned for several months.

23:02.400 --> 23:04.400
We are now very close to the trip

23:04.400 --> 23:06.400
and a 50 something year old sister

23:06.400 --> 23:08.400
who originally declined invite is

23:08.400 --> 23:10.400
interested. However she doesn't want to pay

23:10.400 --> 23:12.400
and wants to sleep on a cot with her boyfriend

23:12.400 --> 23:14.400
in our beach front homes and closed

23:14.400 --> 23:16.400
patio.

23:16.400 --> 23:18.400
How should we handle this? That's from Jim City

23:18.400 --> 23:20.400
Slacker. Oh it's easy. Tell him

23:20.400 --> 23:22.400
to fuck off. What are you even talking

23:22.400 --> 23:24.400
about? We don't

23:24.400 --> 23:26.400
want to pay so you're not going to get any money

23:26.400 --> 23:28.400
out of us and we're also going to make you feel super bad

23:28.400 --> 23:30.400
by sleeping on the ground.

23:30.400 --> 23:32.400
Is that okay? Is that an equitable

23:32.400 --> 23:34.400
solution? We don't want to pay and we

23:34.400 --> 23:36.400
want to have sex on your patio. We're not

23:36.400 --> 23:38.400
only going to not contribute we're going to

23:38.400 --> 23:40.400
make you feel shitty the whole time you're there. Is that

23:40.400 --> 23:42.400
okay? Does that sound like do I am I a

23:42.400 --> 23:44.400
good vacay buddy? So like

23:44.400 --> 23:46.400
if you want to if you if you want to

23:46.400 --> 23:48.400
take them and have them not pay

23:48.400 --> 23:50.400
because times are tight but they

23:50.400 --> 23:52.400
want to like hang out with you that's fine. Do

23:52.400 --> 23:54.400
that. But don't like

23:54.400 --> 23:56.400
this. I fucking

23:56.400 --> 23:58.400
hate that. I'm not going to pay so

23:58.400 --> 24:00.400
I'll just like live in poverty while you guys

24:00.400 --> 24:02.400
do it up sleep in your

24:02.400 --> 24:04.400
like you know thousand thread count

24:04.400 --> 24:06.400
sheets while I huddle

24:06.400 --> 24:08.400
up on the floor underneath some

24:08.400 --> 24:10.400
Us Weeklys. If you have any

24:10.400 --> 24:12.400
bread crusts or any

24:12.400 --> 24:14.400
rinds. Are you guys going

24:14.400 --> 24:16.400
out to a nice dinner again? Well

24:16.400 --> 24:18.400
don't forget the doggy bags I guess.

24:18.400 --> 24:20.400
Right that sucks. And then feed us like dogs.

24:20.400 --> 24:22.400
Just leave

24:22.400 --> 24:24.400
leave your leftovers in a

24:24.400 --> 24:26.400
pile on the floor

24:26.400 --> 24:28.400
outside the mud room and we'll

24:28.400 --> 24:30.400
me and Dan will just get to them. Don't

24:30.400 --> 24:32.400
forget to slop your in-laws.

24:32.400 --> 24:34.400
Go ahead and put in a garbage bag if you

24:34.400 --> 24:36.400
want. We'll just tear open the garbage bag and

24:36.400 --> 24:38.400
then sleep in it later. We'll use it as a

24:38.400 --> 24:40.400
blanket. We'll use it like

24:40.400 --> 24:42.400
a little food womb.

24:42.400 --> 24:44.400
Just sleep

24:44.400 --> 24:46.400
in your trash.

24:46.400 --> 24:48.400
Now that sucks. Don't put any

24:48.400 --> 24:50.400
chicken bones in there though. You know how we

24:50.400 --> 24:52.400
get. Dan choked on the last one.

24:52.400 --> 24:54.400
He's dead now. I crawled inside

24:54.400 --> 24:56.400
him for warmth. You thought

24:56.400 --> 24:58.400
he smelled bad on the outside.

24:58.400 --> 25:00.400
Well we haven't bathed in three

25:00.400 --> 25:02.400
weeks. We don't have a

25:02.400 --> 25:04.400
fancy shower like you people.

25:04.400 --> 25:06.400
No I think that Griffin is

25:06.400 --> 25:08.400
right and if it's like a matter of like they always

25:08.400 --> 25:10.400
wanted to go but like they couldn't

25:10.400 --> 25:12.400
afford it and now it's like hey would it be cool

25:12.400 --> 25:14.400
if we went like that's

25:14.400 --> 25:16.400
different than like hey sure

25:16.400 --> 25:18.400
fuck it we'll go with you. I'm not gonna

25:18.400 --> 25:20.400
pay because you already paid for everything right.

25:20.400 --> 25:22.400
So like there's nothing to pay for. That's

25:22.400 --> 25:24.400
shitty. Yeah that sucks.

25:24.400 --> 25:26.400
I mean I'm not even saying that.

25:26.400 --> 25:28.400
I'm saying if they want to go and not pay and you're fine

25:28.400 --> 25:30.400
with it because you want to spend time with them and they

25:30.400 --> 25:32.400
don't have the money right now and you

25:32.400 --> 25:34.400
feel bad for excluding them and then your family and you

25:34.400 --> 25:36.400
want to chill cool then have them along.

25:36.400 --> 25:38.400
But the I mean

25:38.400 --> 25:40.400
this is more advice for them than it is for you

25:40.400 --> 25:42.400
I guess but just this act of like

25:42.400 --> 25:44.400
we don't have money

25:44.400 --> 25:46.400
so we're gonna

25:46.400 --> 25:48.400
live like poppers

25:48.400 --> 25:50.400
while you guys do up the high life like

25:50.400 --> 25:52.400
that sucks. Can you imagine

25:52.400 --> 25:54.400
being the

25:54.400 --> 25:56.400
boyfriend and asking off

25:56.400 --> 25:58.400
for work like

25:58.400 --> 26:00.400
hey I'm gonna need this week

26:00.400 --> 26:02.400
in July off

26:02.400 --> 26:04.400
I am going to

26:04.400 --> 26:06.400
stay with my girlfriend's

26:06.400 --> 26:08.400
family on the patio

26:08.400 --> 26:10.400
for free

26:10.400 --> 26:12.400
for a week. I don't know why you would be

26:12.400 --> 26:14.400
so specific with your time off

26:14.400 --> 26:16.400
request. I think I'll eat a sandwich

26:16.400 --> 26:18.400
on Thursday and maybe

26:18.400 --> 26:20.400
see a movie on Friday.

26:20.400 --> 26:22.400
I just think this is the ultimate expression

26:22.400 --> 26:24.400
of beach life. I'm pretty sure

26:24.400 --> 26:26.400
this is how Jimmy Buffett was born.

26:26.400 --> 26:28.400
Like he realized he couldn't come back.

26:28.400 --> 26:30.400
He was conceived on a patio. He was like

26:30.400 --> 26:32.400
well once you stay for free

26:32.400 --> 26:34.400
in somebody's enclosed patio

26:34.400 --> 26:36.400
of your girlfriend's family

26:36.400 --> 26:38.400
you really don't get to come back from that level

26:38.400 --> 26:40.400
of chill. You can't

26:40.400 --> 26:42.400
rebuild a normal life with your societal

26:42.400 --> 26:44.400
bounds. Right.

26:44.400 --> 26:46.400
What is this tie? It's a noose is what it is.

26:46.400 --> 26:48.400
Cause I once had the ultimate freedom

26:48.400 --> 26:50.400
of sleeping in a

26:50.400 --> 26:52.400
cot in an enclosed patio

26:52.400 --> 26:54.400
with my girlfriend's family. I made love on a cat.

26:54.400 --> 26:56.400
What?

26:56.400 --> 26:58.400
On a cot on a patio.

26:58.400 --> 27:00.400
I know freedom.

27:00.400 --> 27:02.400
You said I made love on a cat on a

27:02.400 --> 27:04.400
patio. Well that was my favorite

27:04.400 --> 27:06.400
Jimmy Buffett song. Stay.

27:06.400 --> 27:08.400
And my favorite scene from Garfield's

27:08.400 --> 27:10.400
Two Kitties.

27:10.400 --> 27:12.400
Stay put Fluffy. Dad's almost

27:12.400 --> 27:14.400
done.

27:16.400 --> 27:18.400
Do you think that's what cheeseburger in paradise

27:18.400 --> 27:20.400
that song is about? Is that

27:20.400 --> 27:22.400
Jimmy Buffett was starving to death on a family

27:22.400 --> 27:24.400
vacation he didn't pay for and then a miracle

27:24.400 --> 27:26.400
burger just appeared on his naked chest.

27:28.400 --> 27:30.400
Just floating. Floating

27:30.400 --> 27:32.400
in the air. He had to chase it down the beach.

27:32.400 --> 27:34.400
It's not your time James.

27:34.400 --> 27:36.400
Cheeseburger to paradise.

27:38.400 --> 27:40.400
Cheeseburger I found in the trash

27:40.400 --> 27:42.400
with my in-laws. Leftovers

27:42.400 --> 27:44.400
half of a burger.

27:44.400 --> 27:46.400
Some old french fries and half

27:46.400 --> 27:48.400
of a cake. It's just a cheeseburger

27:48.400 --> 27:50.400
I found in the trash.

27:50.400 --> 27:52.400
Cheeseburger or else

27:52.400 --> 27:54.400
I'll die.

27:56.400 --> 27:58.400
I like mine before the maggots get

27:58.400 --> 28:00.400
to it. Next to the ketchup

28:00.400 --> 28:02.400
but not the cheeseburger.

28:02.400 --> 28:04.400
Next to the ketchup but not

28:04.400 --> 28:06.400
next to tampons.

28:10.400 --> 28:12.400
None of that is in the garbage.

28:20.400 --> 28:22.400
Cheese tampon in paradise.

28:24.400 --> 28:26.400
Can't be too picky when you're close to

28:26.400 --> 28:32.400
the edge.

28:34.400 --> 28:36.400
Jimmy I don't think we can

28:36.400 --> 28:38.400
release this song.

28:38.400 --> 28:40.400
Use your imagination to just

28:40.400 --> 28:42.400
get it down.

28:42.400 --> 28:44.400
Hey Jimmy could you come to my

28:44.400 --> 28:46.400
office real quick? I want to talk to you about your latest

28:46.400 --> 28:48.400
single. Yeah it's just sandwiches

28:48.400 --> 28:50.400
there. They're probably not

28:50.400 --> 28:52.400
going to be good. Yeah it turns out it's the most popular

28:52.400 --> 28:54.400
song ever.

28:54.400 --> 28:56.400
We can't have it on the shelves.

28:56.400 --> 28:58.400
It's uniting the world like

28:58.400 --> 29:00.400
mild stallions.

29:00.400 --> 29:02.400
He had to travel 800

29:02.400 --> 29:04.400
years to the future to pin cheese

29:04.400 --> 29:06.400
tampons in paradise.

29:06.400 --> 29:08.400
How about a money

29:08.400 --> 29:10.400
zone? Yeah.

29:20.400 --> 29:22.400
We've talked about this before and we'll say it again

29:22.400 --> 29:24.400
90 percent that's the amount

29:24.400 --> 29:26.400
of time that you are in underpants.

29:26.400 --> 29:28.400
Not sure.

29:28.400 --> 29:30.400
Get old fast.

29:30.400 --> 29:32.400
No listen I don't want to like cause a stink with

29:32.400 --> 29:34.400
the bullet points that Meandis has provided us but I

29:34.400 --> 29:36.400
would say that number is much much much much

29:36.400 --> 29:38.400
much much higher for me.

29:40.400 --> 29:42.400
When was the last time you weren't wearing underwear Griffin?

29:44.400 --> 29:46.400
I mean there's a

29:46.400 --> 29:48.400
like an eight second period. No not even

29:48.400 --> 29:50.400
that I would say about I would say there's about

29:50.400 --> 29:52.400
a four second period there when I switch between

29:52.400 --> 29:54.400
pairs of Meandis and

29:54.400 --> 29:56.400
that's about all that you can get out of me

29:56.400 --> 29:58.400
vis a vis my ding dong being exposed

29:58.400 --> 30:00.400
to the world. Well

30:00.400 --> 30:02.400
not everybody has those sorts

30:02.400 --> 30:04.400
of

30:04.400 --> 30:06.400
restrictions I think. Oh they

30:06.400 --> 30:08.400
are not restrictive at all. They are

30:08.400 --> 30:10.400
breathable and soft and I need them on me

30:10.400 --> 30:12.400
at all times.

30:12.400 --> 30:14.400
I am technically

30:14.400 --> 30:16.400
speaking wearing Meandis right now

30:16.400 --> 30:18.400
if you guys have to know the truth.

30:18.400 --> 30:20.400
Wait what do you mean technically like

30:20.400 --> 30:22.400
you're wearing one on your head?

30:22.400 --> 30:24.400
He's turned them into he's fashioned them into a sharp

30:24.400 --> 30:26.400
bangle. I'm legally

30:26.400 --> 30:28.400
wearing Meandis right now.

30:28.400 --> 30:30.400
They're contractual Meandis.

30:30.400 --> 30:32.400
I'm wearing contractual Meandis.

30:32.400 --> 30:34.400
We call them Meandis by the way.

30:34.400 --> 30:36.400
At this point I just

30:36.400 --> 30:38.400
assume that everyone's does like

30:38.400 --> 30:40.400
made the switch but if you haven't

30:40.400 --> 30:42.400
Meandis is a great fitting

30:42.400 --> 30:44.400
pair of underwear that's two times softer than

30:44.400 --> 30:46.400
cotton and that is no BS.

30:46.400 --> 30:48.400
100% true. They are lovely.

30:48.400 --> 30:50.400
If you go to Meandis.com

30:56.400 --> 30:58.400
a little late because you've done Miss Valentine's Day

30:58.400 --> 31:00.400
but let me just throw out matching underpants.

31:00.400 --> 31:02.400
It's a good look. It's

31:02.400 --> 31:04.400
Presidents Day right? Today is Presidents

31:04.400 --> 31:06.400
Day when you're listening to this. Sure.

31:06.400 --> 31:08.400
Yeah. God it's going to be hard because

31:08.400 --> 31:10.400
they have to ship them and stuff.

31:10.400 --> 31:12.400
If you can go to the the Meandis

31:12.400 --> 31:14.400
factory and get them hot off the

31:14.400 --> 31:16.400
tap and then just like throw those

31:24.400 --> 31:26.400

31:26.400 --> 31:28.400
And the Meandis fabric

31:28.400 --> 31:30.400
is it's awesome. It fits great. Doesn't

31:30.400 --> 31:32.400
ride up and it literally

31:32.400 --> 31:34.400
pulls moisture away from your skin so you're cool

31:34.400 --> 31:36.400
all day long. You're so comfortable

31:36.400 --> 31:38.400

31:54.400 --> 31:56.400
my god why have I not been girding my loins

31:56.400 --> 31:58.400
with these like my whole life. Let me

31:58.400 --> 32:00.400
ask you two a question.

32:00.400 --> 32:02.400
Hit me. Let me ask you two a science question.

32:02.400 --> 32:04.400
Okay.

32:04.400 --> 32:06.400
You put the Meandis on

32:06.400 --> 32:08.400
and then it draws the moisture

32:08.400 --> 32:10.400
away from your zone.

32:10.400 --> 32:12.400
Uh huh. That is that

32:12.400 --> 32:14.400
was that's what we've been told by corporate overlords.

32:14.400 --> 32:16.400
And I've been told. Like a Fremen suit.

32:16.400 --> 32:18.400
Yeah. I've been told that yes it's a Fremen

32:18.400 --> 32:20.400
suit. You put it on and

32:20.400 --> 32:22.400
I've also been told this just sort of by

32:22.400 --> 32:24.400
my zone because it knows what it likes

32:24.400 --> 32:26.400
and it likes dryness. And

32:26.400 --> 32:28.400
it's Bluetooth compatible. It pulls

32:28.400 --> 32:30.400
away your gooch juice

32:30.400 --> 32:32.400
and it pulls it all away and it keeps

32:32.400 --> 32:34.400
it super dry and it removes the moisture.

32:34.400 --> 32:36.400
But it doesn't get very

32:36.400 --> 32:38.400
soggy. Is it teleporting?

32:38.400 --> 32:40.400
Your gooch juice

32:40.400 --> 32:42.400
away? Is it like a wizard?

32:42.400 --> 32:44.400
Where is the juice going?

32:44.400 --> 32:46.400
I don't know. The juice is loose.

32:46.400 --> 32:48.400
The juice is loose but is it being fucking

32:48.400 --> 32:50.400
procedurally atomized?

32:50.400 --> 32:52.400
What's going on?

32:52.400 --> 32:54.400
Is it vaping my juice?

32:54.400 --> 32:56.400
Have you seen Willy Wonka in the Chocolate Factory?

32:56.400 --> 32:58.400
And you know Mike TV? Yeah.

32:58.400 --> 33:00.400
Okay. Every time you wear Meandis

33:00.400 --> 33:02.400
someone on your television gets wet underpants.

33:02.400 --> 33:04.400
Okay. That's cool.

33:04.400 --> 33:06.400
That makes perfect sense. Anyway go to Meandis.com

33:06.400 --> 33:08.400
slash my brother and try those

33:08.400 --> 33:10.400
out. You're going to love them.

33:10.400 --> 33:12.400
Who else we got?

33:12.400 --> 33:14.400
Well we've got like

33:14.400 --> 33:16.400
old school friend of the show.

33:16.400 --> 33:18.400
Oh man. Classic. Nature

33:18.400 --> 33:20.400
box. Classic

33:20.400 --> 33:22.400
pals at nature box. I'm trying to think

33:22.400 --> 33:24.400
of like how do you not already know about nature

33:24.400 --> 33:26.400
box at this point? I just

33:26.400 --> 33:28.400
assume that everybody at this point is wearing

33:28.400 --> 33:30.400
Meandis and snacking on nature

33:30.400 --> 33:32.400
box which are whole. I mean

33:32.400 --> 33:34.400
you're going to snack right? Everybody's

33:34.400 --> 33:36.400
going to snack. Everybody knows that. But

33:36.400 --> 33:38.400
what nature box affords you is an opportunity

33:38.400 --> 33:40.400
to do it in a healthy style.

33:40.400 --> 33:42.400
Healthy. Not just healthy but like

33:42.400 --> 33:44.400
with a rotation of like brand

33:44.400 --> 33:46.400
new snacks every time you receive a box.

33:46.400 --> 33:48.400
Like you're not going to. There's so many

33:48.400 --> 33:50.400
options. So many different choices. You can choose

33:50.400 --> 33:52.400
the same ones if you're like oh my god I

33:52.400 --> 33:54.400
love those pistachio power clusters.

33:54.400 --> 33:56.400
I never want to not have those. Great.

33:56.400 --> 33:58.400
You can get those and then try like three or

33:58.400 --> 34:00.400
four new ones that month. You know what I mean?

34:00.400 --> 34:02.400
And you're like okay now I love this. We just

34:02.400 --> 34:04.400
did garlic plantain chips.

34:04.400 --> 34:06.400
Whoa that sounds good.

34:06.400 --> 34:08.400
They're insane. They're so

34:08.400 --> 34:10.400
good. I have to make sure I don't just

34:10.400 --> 34:12.400
keep eating them because then

34:12.400 --> 34:14.400
all I will taste for the next three days

34:14.400 --> 34:16.400
is garlic. But they're so good.

34:16.400 --> 34:18.400
And tiny bananas. That's

34:18.400 --> 34:20.400
what a plantain is.

34:20.400 --> 34:22.400
A plantain is like a little baby banana. It's so

34:22.400 --> 34:24.400
cute. But yeah there's like you can also

34:24.400 --> 34:26.400
there's stuff like dried berries and like

34:26.400 --> 34:28.400
some dried pineapple slices that are so

34:28.400 --> 34:30.400
good. So basically any kind of

34:30.400 --> 34:32.400
snack that you like whether it's savory, sweet,

34:32.400 --> 34:34.400
spicy, whatever.

34:34.400 --> 34:36.400
Umami. You're going to find

34:36.400 --> 34:38.400
something at Nature Box that you're like

34:38.400 --> 34:40.400
okay yeah that sounds incredible.

34:40.400 --> 34:42.400

34:42.400 --> 34:44.400
new snacks. And they have zero

34:44.400 --> 34:46.400
artificial flavors, colors, or sweeteners.

34:46.400 --> 34:48.400

34:48.400 --> 34:50.400
no high fructose corn syrup. So it's like

34:50.400 --> 34:52.400
the best. And here's the best thing about

34:52.400 --> 34:54.400
it in case you didn't already know.

34:54.400 --> 34:56.400
You have the chance to try Nature Box for

34:56.400 --> 34:58.400

34:58.400 --> 35:00.400

35:00.400 --> 35:02.400
It's making me angry

35:02.400 --> 35:04.400
now that you're lying. I am not

35:04.400 --> 35:06.400
lying Justin. I am 100% telling the truth. There's no way

35:06.400 --> 35:08.400
any deal could be this good.

35:08.400 --> 35:10.400
It is that good Justin. And you know why?

35:10.400 --> 35:12.400
Because we love our listeners. Nature Box

35:12.400 --> 35:14.400
was like I don't know about these free snacks guys. And we put our

35:14.400 --> 35:16.400
foot down and we dominated them. We stared

35:16.400 --> 35:18.400
them in the eye and we said give them free

35:18.400 --> 35:20.400
snacks. And they said okay please don't punch us in the

35:20.400 --> 35:22.400
butt again. And they said but

35:22.400 --> 35:24.400
you have to go to their house and hand deliver it and then

35:24.400 --> 35:26.400
mouth feed it to them like a baby bird.

35:26.400 --> 35:28.400
And I said that's fine. And that's

35:28.400 --> 35:30.400
the only, listen, it's not ideal.

35:30.400 --> 35:32.400
You're gonna wish

35:32.400 --> 35:34.400
that you were eating these delicious

35:34.400 --> 35:36.400
sriracha roasted cashews

35:36.400 --> 35:38.400
without us having to chew them up and spit them

35:38.400 --> 35:40.400
in your mouth like a baby bird. Well an adult bird.

35:40.400 --> 35:42.400
But that's just

35:42.400 --> 35:44.400
the way the cookie crumbles. But it won't

35:44.400 --> 35:46.400
cost you anything. And we're very

35:46.400 --> 35:48.400

36:00.400 --> 36:02.400
had a very long journey in the postal service

36:02.400 --> 36:04.400
system. I have

36:04.400 --> 36:06.400
a call to action for you listeners

36:36.400 --> 36:38.400
smile. I got my wallet out. Just like

36:38.400 --> 36:40.400
you saying it I got my wallet out.

36:40.400 --> 36:42.400
Think Doctor Who crossed with

36:42.400 --> 36:44.400
Archer and a little bit of high grade alcohol

36:44.400 --> 36:46.400
consumption. Does that sound awesome?

36:46.400 --> 36:48.400
Then you want Robocopter

36:48.400 --> 36:50.400
Ski Patrol. The best way to buy someone's

36:50.400 --> 36:52.400
love especially the authors

36:52.400 --> 36:54.400
and you know you want that.

36:54.400 --> 36:56.400
This is a book written

36:56.400 --> 36:58.400
by Aaron Seacross

36:58.400 --> 37:00.400
that you can get on Amazon.

37:00.400 --> 37:02.400
They have it on paperback or Kindle

37:02.400 --> 37:04.400
if you like digi stuff.

37:04.400 --> 37:06.400
And it is about a group of

37:06.400 --> 37:08.400
quote idiots and perverts

37:08.400 --> 37:10.400
and an international

37:10.400 --> 37:12.400
conspiracy and there's

37:12.400 --> 37:14.400
a great drawing on the front of the book

37:14.400 --> 37:16.400
of the Robocopter in question

37:16.400 --> 37:18.400
that looks like maybe I did it

37:18.400 --> 37:20.400
when I was seven years old.

37:20.400 --> 37:22.400
It kind of reminds me of the album art

37:22.400 --> 37:24.400
or the cover art for Grant Andrews

37:24.400 --> 37:26.400
Kid Cop which is

37:26.400 --> 37:28.400
my classic book coming soon to Amazon.

37:30.400 --> 37:32.400
It looks great. So that's on

37:32.400 --> 37:34.400
Amazon now. Think about

37:34.400 --> 37:36.400
it. Look inside your heart.

37:36.400 --> 37:38.400
Just decide that you need Robocopter Ski

37:38.400 --> 37:40.400
Patrol in your life. And then

37:40.400 --> 37:42.400
just buy it. Don't think about it anymore.

37:42.400 --> 37:44.400
I have a message for Kevin.

37:44.400 --> 37:46.400
Riptide Ruiz. I think

37:46.400 --> 37:48.400
I fucked that up. And it's from

37:48.400 --> 37:50.400
Ginny Rampage Hernandez

37:50.400 --> 37:52.400
and Sean Bandana Mitchell.

37:54.400 --> 37:56.400
Ginny or sorry

37:56.400 --> 37:58.400
Rampage and Bandana say to Riptide

37:58.400 --> 38:00.400
The starry eyed

38:00.400 --> 38:02.400
angler gnashes through spinal

38:02.400 --> 38:04.400
caps left by spinal taps and constant

38:04.400 --> 38:06.400
lashes and knickknacks fallen

38:06.400 --> 38:08.400
around her tummy sack. Lay your

38:08.400 --> 38:10.400
head on the supple breasts of the mayor smoking

38:10.400 --> 38:12.400
crack. That laugh that was bathed

38:12.400 --> 38:14.400
in ichor comes from playing

38:14.400 --> 38:16.400
like a matador has us rolling on the floor.

38:16.400 --> 38:18.400
Did I ever tell you your mother

38:18.400 --> 38:20.400
is a whore? Woof.

38:20.400 --> 38:22.400
Woofa doofa. Hoofy doofy.

38:22.400 --> 38:24.400
Rampage Bandana you're better than that.

38:24.400 --> 38:26.400
What happened?

38:26.400 --> 38:28.400
What did I just read?

38:28.400 --> 38:30.400
What was any of that?

38:30.400 --> 38:32.400
I think you're a slam poet now.

38:32.400 --> 38:34.400
I think I might be. Did I not slam

38:34.400 --> 38:36.400
that hard enough? The starry eyed

38:36.400 --> 38:38.400
angler

38:38.400 --> 38:40.400
gnashes through

38:40.400 --> 38:42.400
spinal caps.

38:42.400 --> 38:44.400
Hold on. I'm going to decipher this real quick.

38:44.400 --> 38:46.400
Oh Riptide

38:46.400 --> 38:48.400
just graduated from college. Congratulations

38:48.400 --> 38:50.400
Kevin. Congratulations Riptide.

38:50.400 --> 38:52.400
We're very proud of you.

38:52.400 --> 38:54.400
It was a hard time

38:54.400 --> 38:56.400
getting through Spinal

38:56.400 --> 38:58.400

You did a really great job. Happy

39:00.400 --> 39:02.400

39:56.400 --> 39:58.400
wisdom

39:58.400 --> 40:00.400
farm wisdom. It's been a while.

40:00.400 --> 40:02.400
Make a cake right out of hay farm

40:02.400 --> 40:04.400
wisdom. Make a what now?

40:04.400 --> 40:06.400
Make a cake right out of hay farm

40:06.400 --> 40:08.400
wisdom. Make cakes. I got make

40:08.400 --> 40:10.400
a but then what? Make a cake

40:10.400 --> 40:12.400
right out of hay farm

40:12.400 --> 40:14.400

40:14.400 --> 40:16.400
rat. Have the saddest birthday

40:16.400 --> 40:18.400
farm wisdom.

40:18.400 --> 40:20.400
Well not if you're a cow.

40:20.400 --> 40:22.400
If you're a cow I

40:22.400 --> 40:24.400
go down real soon. It would be fucking dope.

40:24.400 --> 40:26.400
Farm wisdom. It's back.

40:26.400 --> 40:28.400
Griffin read the first one.

40:28.400 --> 40:30.400
This one is from Hannah who says

40:30.400 --> 40:32.400
donkeys hate canines.

40:32.400 --> 40:34.400
To protect your sheep from coyotes

40:34.400 --> 40:36.400
you should get a couple of donkeys.

40:36.400 --> 40:38.400
They get lonesome if they are only

40:38.400 --> 40:40.400
one. Ain't that the truth. Be

40:40.400 --> 40:42.400
very careful. They will sometimes

40:42.400 --> 40:44.400
kick and kill pet dogs.

40:44.400 --> 40:46.400
Man.

40:46.400 --> 40:48.400
You gotta really hate

40:48.400 --> 40:50.400
dogs. Yeah.

40:50.400 --> 40:52.400
You know that movie Must Love Dogs?

40:52.400 --> 40:54.400
Don't try to set

40:54.400 --> 40:56.400
a donkey up with Jenny Garofalo.

40:56.400 --> 40:58.400
I don't know what I just said.

40:58.400 --> 41:00.400
No that was

41:00.400 --> 41:02.400
what that movie was about. Was she in it

41:02.400 --> 41:04.400
or was that true about cats? Nope.

41:04.400 --> 41:06.400
Oh fuck. Okay.

41:06.400 --> 41:08.400
So now I know that. Also

41:08.400 --> 41:10.400
about coyotes. They love to

41:10.400 --> 41:12.400
hunt domesticated dogs.

41:12.400 --> 41:14.400
The way they do it is to send one

41:14.400 --> 41:16.400
coyote of the pack to play with the dog

41:16.400 --> 41:18.400
and lure it back to the pack where they will kill

41:18.400 --> 41:20.400
it and eat it. They don't eat

41:20.400 --> 41:22.400
the paws though. So if you see

41:22.400 --> 41:24.400
your dog playing with a coyote get it

41:24.400 --> 41:26.400
away fast. What the

41:26.400 --> 41:28.400
fuck coyotes?

41:28.400 --> 41:30.400
They're all honeypotting

41:30.400 --> 41:32.400
all over the place. They're setting up these

41:32.400 --> 41:34.400
irresistible honeypot play

41:34.400 --> 41:36.400
pin traps. This is some

41:36.400 --> 41:38.400
fucking garbage.

41:38.400 --> 41:40.400
I can't believe

41:40.400 --> 41:42.400
that coyotes weren't

41:42.400 --> 41:44.400
any better

41:44.400 --> 41:46.400
than this. You'd think they would have a little more

41:46.400 --> 41:48.400
respect for their superiors.

41:48.400 --> 41:50.400
Why do

41:50.400 --> 41:52.400
you think they consume all the

41:52.400 --> 41:54.400
coyote but they draw the line or the

41:54.400 --> 41:56.400
dog but they draw the line at the paws?

41:56.400 --> 41:58.400
Because that's the part that's been on a

41:58.400 --> 42:00.400
human floor.

42:00.400 --> 42:02.400
It's too prim and

42:02.400 --> 42:04.400
proper, you know what I mean?

42:04.400 --> 42:06.400
This is fucked up. Hey, you like

42:06.400 --> 42:08.400
to play? Hey, check out

42:08.400 --> 42:10.400
this butt. You want to sniff it? Yeah, let's do a

42:10.400 --> 42:12.400
butt sniff. Hey, you know where we can find a lot

42:12.400 --> 42:14.400
of other butts? We can just sort of slam

42:14.400 --> 42:16.400
jam on and just sort of

42:16.400 --> 42:18.400
sniff all day until the sun comes down.

42:18.400 --> 42:20.400
I can tell you back in my

42:20.400 --> 42:22.400
coyote house. Come back to my coyote house. I got

42:22.400 --> 42:24.400
about six or seven butts there and we can go sniff them

42:24.400 --> 42:26.400
together and you'll come home with your paws intact.

42:26.400 --> 42:28.400
I promise you're going to have a great time.

42:28.400 --> 42:30.400
Don't mind all the paws laying around. We got piles

42:30.400 --> 42:32.400
of paws, piles of paws. Don't worry about those.

42:32.400 --> 42:34.400
Those are from other dogs but they're not

42:34.400 --> 42:36.400
as special as you. I'm sure you'll pass through our coyote

42:36.400 --> 42:38.400
gauntlet just fine. Unmarred.

42:38.400 --> 42:40.400
Just come on through, come on through.

42:40.400 --> 42:42.400
Butts are just a little bit further, a little bit further

42:42.400 --> 42:44.400
and chomp.

42:44.400 --> 42:46.400
I also want to say

42:46.400 --> 42:48.400
Hannah, thank you so much for sending these in.

42:48.400 --> 42:50.400
But I can honestly say even without this

42:50.400 --> 42:52.400
little snippet of farm wisdom, if I looked

42:52.400 --> 42:54.400
out my window and saw my dog playing

42:54.400 --> 42:56.400
with a coyote, I wouldn't just be like

42:56.400 --> 42:58.400
aww how cute.

42:58.400 --> 43:00.400
That's sweet. I'll tell you what else I

43:00.400 --> 43:02.400
wouldn't do though. Get

43:02.400 --> 43:04.400
in the middle of that

43:04.400 --> 43:06.400
because clearly coyotes

43:06.400 --> 43:08.400
like to eat dogs very very much

43:08.400 --> 43:10.400
and I don't want to

43:10.400 --> 43:12.400
I don't want to be the one

43:12.400 --> 43:14.400
who is saying please don't do this.

43:14.400 --> 43:16.400
Oh you don't want to take that away from

43:16.400 --> 43:18.400
the coyote? Well no

43:18.400 --> 43:20.400
I don't want to take me into

43:20.400 --> 43:22.400
the coyote. I don't want to be

43:22.400 --> 43:24.400
eaten by a coyote.

43:24.400 --> 43:26.400
If Justin had his

43:26.400 --> 43:28.400
I love dogs. I love dogs.

43:28.400 --> 43:30.400
I know where they sell them.

43:30.400 --> 43:32.400
He loves coyotes but

43:32.400 --> 43:34.400
the outside of them. Not the inside.

43:34.400 --> 43:36.400
Not the inside. I don't need a better look there.

43:36.400 --> 43:38.400
I love dogs.

43:38.400 --> 43:40.400
I know where they sell dogs.

43:40.400 --> 43:42.400
Yeah. Do you guys want a yahoo?

43:42.400 --> 43:44.400
Sure, yeah.

43:44.400 --> 43:46.400
This yahoo was sent in by

43:46.400 --> 43:48.400
level 14,000 Yajur Shaman

43:48.400 --> 43:50.400
Drew Davenport. Thank you Drew.

43:50.400 --> 43:52.400
It's by Yajur Answers user

43:52.400 --> 43:54.400
Ricardus who asks

43:54.400 --> 43:56.400
Scientists

43:56.400 --> 43:58.400
try to dim the sun

43:58.400 --> 44:00.400
witches pray

44:00.400 --> 44:02.400
so that the sun doesn't shine.

44:02.400 --> 44:04.400
The result will be

44:04.400 --> 44:06.400
famine. What needs to be

44:06.400 --> 44:08.400
done about this?

44:10.400 --> 44:12.400
Okay, so

44:12.400 --> 44:14.400
run it back.

44:14.400 --> 44:16.400
The question asker is

44:16.400 --> 44:18.400
just stating the fact

44:18.400 --> 44:20.400
that scientists

44:20.400 --> 44:22.400
All facts here, baby.

44:22.400 --> 44:24.400
Okay, scientists are trying to dim the sun.

44:24.400 --> 44:26.400
Fact. Correct.

44:26.400 --> 44:28.400
While simultaneously

44:28.400 --> 44:30.400
on the other end of the spectrum

44:30.400 --> 44:32.400
witches are trying to stop the sun

44:32.400 --> 44:34.400
from shining. Oops, both

44:34.400 --> 44:36.400
worked. Now we got famine.

44:36.400 --> 44:38.400
Yeah.

44:38.400 --> 44:40.400
If we need witches and scientists to agree

44:40.400 --> 44:42.400
that just one of them is going to keep

44:42.400 --> 44:44.400
the sun in check. Because right now

44:44.400 --> 44:46.400
there's a little bit too much

44:46.400 --> 44:48.400
between the science and the prayers.

44:48.400 --> 44:50.400
Sounds getting a little too dark for my

44:50.400 --> 44:52.400
taste, thank you.

44:52.400 --> 44:54.400
Did the scientists go to

44:54.400 --> 44:56.400
the witches as like

44:56.400 --> 44:58.400
one option for

44:58.400 --> 45:00.400
keeping the sun in check? Like listen, our science

45:00.400 --> 45:02.400
isn't getting it. We have

45:02.400 --> 45:04.400
one other scientific solution, witches.

45:04.400 --> 45:06.400
Please, please, just

45:06.400 --> 45:08.400
dim it down. Keep it down. See, I

45:08.400 --> 45:10.400
was thinking that it was more of a circumstance

45:10.400 --> 45:12.400
in which the two sides just forgot

45:12.400 --> 45:14.400
to communicate with each other. Yeah, that's what I

45:14.400 --> 45:16.400
think is happening. Oh no, it was an off week.

45:16.400 --> 45:18.400
Science was supposed to keep the sun

45:18.400 --> 45:20.400
not burning the planet up.

45:20.400 --> 45:22.400
And they're like, no, because last week

45:22.400 --> 45:24.400
wait, hold on, was it an odd numbered week?

45:24.400 --> 45:26.400
Oh no, we scienced and magicked.

45:26.400 --> 45:28.400
We scienced and magicked too dark.

45:28.400 --> 45:30.400
Science had the week off.

45:30.400 --> 45:32.400
It's so vitally important that

45:32.400 --> 45:34.400
at least one of these two organizations is

45:34.400 --> 45:36.400
doing something about the goddamn sun now.

45:36.400 --> 45:38.400
Or else what's up, day after

45:38.400 --> 45:40.400
tomorrow, solar flares,

45:40.400 --> 45:42.400
Golden Gate Bridge, that's gone.

45:42.400 --> 45:44.400
The sun got melted by the sun's extreme heat.

45:44.400 --> 45:46.400
Why?

45:46.400 --> 45:48.400
Okay. Ionosphere?

45:48.400 --> 45:50.400
Witches did that, so you have

45:50.400 --> 45:52.400
them to thank for the ionosphere.

45:52.400 --> 45:54.400
No, here's the one thing I will say

45:54.400 --> 45:56.400
to Justin's point. I love

45:56.400 --> 45:58.400
anyone who poses a question

45:58.400 --> 46:00.400
and then ends it, like, poses a hypothetical

46:00.400 --> 46:02.400
and it's like, what can we do to stop it?

46:02.400 --> 46:04.400
It's like, but you, but you,

46:04.400 --> 46:06.400
that's like saying, like, what if demons

46:06.400 --> 46:08.400
attacked, demons and monsters

46:08.400 --> 46:10.400
attacked Earth? What could be done?

46:10.400 --> 46:12.400
This is, this is, Travis, this is fucking

46:12.400 --> 46:14.400
Debate Club 101.

46:14.400 --> 46:16.400
If you even open up

46:16.400 --> 46:18.400
your, uh,

46:18.400 --> 46:20.400
if you even open up your statement

46:20.400 --> 46:22.400
to be

46:22.400 --> 46:24.400
possibly disproven, if you

46:24.400 --> 46:26.400
show even a fraction of a shadow of doubt

46:26.400 --> 46:28.400
in your own mind, then your enemy

46:28.400 --> 46:30.400
debater is gonna come at you with a

46:30.400 --> 46:32.400
hearty riposte, and he's gonna tear

46:32.400 --> 46:34.400
your shit apart. This is why

46:34.400 --> 46:36.400
just like a coyote

46:36.400 --> 46:38.400
does with a dog.

46:38.400 --> 46:40.400
I appreciate this question

46:40.400 --> 46:42.400
asked here. Doesn't want to get hung up too

46:42.400 --> 46:44.400
much on the will they, won't

46:44.400 --> 46:46.400
they of witches and

46:46.400 --> 46:48.400
science. Will those two kids ever get

46:48.400 --> 46:50.400
together?

46:50.400 --> 46:52.400
This person has left right

46:52.400 --> 46:54.400
to, let's get, of course

46:54.400 --> 46:56.400
it's going to happen. Let's work on

46:56.400 --> 46:58.400
solutions together, internet.

46:58.400 --> 47:00.400
Let's get a plan together

47:00.400 --> 47:02.400
for when this does happen. Okay, we're gonna have

47:02.400 --> 47:04.400
to get the daughter of the Witch King to

47:04.400 --> 47:06.400
fall in love with the son of the lead

47:06.400 --> 47:08.400
scientist, right? And it's like

47:08.400 --> 47:10.400
what science and magic together

47:10.400 --> 47:12.400
this couldn't possibly be. But then

47:12.400 --> 47:14.400
they really hit it off, and they're like

47:14.400 --> 47:16.400
man, love would be great if we weren't so hungry

47:16.400 --> 47:18.400
because of this blasted famine.

47:18.400 --> 47:20.400
Oh, solutions.

47:20.400 --> 47:22.400
She'll fill his belly

47:22.400 --> 47:24.400
with her magical

47:24.400 --> 47:26.400
spawn, and when

47:26.400 --> 47:28.400
that baby comes out of his body,

47:28.400 --> 47:30.400
fully formed man,

47:30.400 --> 47:32.400
he will be the

47:32.400 --> 47:34.400
solar lord. Please tell me

47:34.400 --> 47:36.400
Travis, there is at least one

47:36.400 --> 47:38.400
or Griffin, please tell me there's at least

47:38.400 --> 47:40.400
one response to this.

47:40.400 --> 47:42.400
A question from someone saying

47:42.400 --> 47:44.400
okay, I'm picking up what you're laying down

47:44.400 --> 47:46.400
let me uh, fly my pen. Finally someone had the

47:46.400 --> 47:48.400
balls to say it. Well, we're

47:48.400 --> 47:50.400
all thinking. Uh,

47:50.400 --> 47:52.400
well, first off, let me hit you with

47:52.400 --> 47:54.400
Saucy's response. My fucking voice

47:54.400 --> 47:56.400
Saucy is in the comments.

47:56.400 --> 47:58.400
You know when he's got something to say, you can't fucking

47:58.400 --> 48:00.400
keep Saucy down. And

48:00.400 --> 48:02.400
Saucy said, damn some

48:02.400 --> 48:04.400
does sound good right now.

48:04.400 --> 48:06.400
Nice.

48:06.400 --> 48:08.400
Whoa, Saucy,

48:08.400 --> 48:10.400
you completely, you just intentionally

48:10.400 --> 48:12.400
misinterpreted dim sun. And he

48:12.400 --> 48:14.400
did it. That's classic. That's fucking classic

48:14.400 --> 48:16.400
Saucy. And he just, oh my,

48:16.400 --> 48:18.400
someone call an ambulance because my gut just

48:18.400 --> 48:20.400
fucking busted. Now I'm septic.

48:20.400 --> 48:22.400
Um,

48:22.400 --> 48:24.400
Witness of Jesus, uh,

48:24.400 --> 48:26.400
has a pretty level headed, um,

48:26.400 --> 48:28.400
response that has nothing to do with the Rothschild

48:28.400 --> 48:30.400
banking cartels. Oops, no wait.

48:30.400 --> 48:32.400
Uh, ultimately, we need

48:32.400 --> 48:34.400
to put climate changers in jail for

48:34.400 --> 48:36.400
fraud and embezzlement of taxes.

48:36.400 --> 48:38.400
We need to get rid of the United Nations

48:38.400 --> 48:40.400
and all treaties, and we need to

48:40.400 --> 48:42.400
put the last ten presidents in jail

48:42.400 --> 48:44.400
for treason with the Rockefellers and the

48:44.400 --> 48:46.400
Rothschilds for being enemies of

48:46.400 --> 48:48.400
American citizens. Witches need to

48:48.400 --> 48:50.400
repent, no doubt. Everything

48:50.400 --> 48:52.400
thinks their own versions of

48:52.400 --> 48:54.400
sin and idolatry are okay. Not so.

48:54.400 --> 48:56.400
Everything that offends will be destroyed.

48:56.400 --> 48:58.400
And to me, the true definition of a witch

48:58.400 --> 49:00.400
is one who poisons.

49:00.400 --> 49:02.400
So just like everything.

49:02.400 --> 49:04.400
All of it.

49:04.400 --> 49:06.400
I love a comment that

49:06.400 --> 49:08.400
even the question asker who asked about

49:08.400 --> 49:10.400
witches and scientists did me something like,

49:10.400 --> 49:12.400
whoa, calm down, crazy person. Guys,

49:12.400 --> 49:14.400
chemtrails are obviously a

49:14.400 --> 49:16.400
direct result of President Obama

49:16.400 --> 49:18.400
through Carter's

49:18.400 --> 49:20.400
witch sin. What?

49:20.400 --> 49:22.400
We need to put the last ten presidents in jail, even the

49:22.400 --> 49:24.400
dead ones. We gotta put

49:24.400 --> 49:26.400
them. We need to

49:26.400 --> 49:28.400
exhume Reagan, and it's the only

49:28.400 --> 49:30.400
way we're gonna get rid of these god damn

49:30.400 --> 49:32.400
chemtrails.

49:32.400 --> 49:34.400
Fuck me.

49:34.400 --> 49:36.400
Jesus. And a witch is just

49:36.400 --> 49:38.400
someone who poisons.

49:38.400 --> 49:40.400
No, a witch is

49:40.400 --> 49:42.400
not that. No, that's just unfair

49:42.400 --> 49:44.400
because you're gonna lump a lot of just regular

49:44.400 --> 49:46.400
poisoners in with witches.

49:46.400 --> 49:48.400
I just want one question that is just

49:48.400 --> 49:50.400
gonna be relaxing to answer.

49:50.400 --> 49:52.400
I don't think that's so much to ask.

49:52.400 --> 49:54.400
I just want one soothing

49:54.400 --> 49:56.400
question. Yeah.

49:56.400 --> 49:58.400
You mean it's not soothing thinking about the witch

49:58.400 --> 50:00.400
led solar death of the universe?

50:00.400 --> 50:02.400
Yeah. What is your opinion

50:02.400 --> 50:04.400
on returning food if your order

50:04.400 --> 50:06.400
is incorrect? There we go. This is nice.

50:06.400 --> 50:08.400
And does your opinion alter

50:08.400 --> 50:10.400
if the food is takeout rather than

50:10.400 --> 50:12.400
dine in? Recently I ordered

50:12.400 --> 50:14.400
a calzone from a local pizza- okay,

50:14.400 --> 50:16.400
listen, you know what? I don't

50:16.400 --> 50:18.400
need this whole story. They got your calzone

50:18.400 --> 50:20.400
wrong, right?

50:20.400 --> 50:22.400
Well, no, okay, the fuck up that they did

50:22.400 --> 50:24.400
is, in my mind,

50:24.400 --> 50:26.400
treasonous.

50:26.400 --> 50:28.400
I think they should be hanged from the

50:28.400 --> 50:30.400
neck until dead for what they did

50:30.400 --> 50:32.400
to this man's calzone. I ordered a calzone from a local

50:32.400 --> 50:34.400
pizzeria in which the filling I received was ham

50:34.400 --> 50:36.400
rather than pepperoni. Hang from the neck

50:36.400 --> 50:38.400
until dead.

50:38.400 --> 50:40.400
Dead in the street.

50:40.400 --> 50:42.400
This is high treason. High

50:42.400 --> 50:44.400
calzone treason. Drag

50:44.400 --> 50:46.400
them away. With a calzone,

50:46.400 --> 50:48.400
you didn't know till you bit into

50:48.400 --> 50:50.400
it. You couldn't look and say like,

50:50.400 --> 50:52.400
oh, you had to take a bite and be like,

50:52.400 --> 50:54.400
oh, oh.

50:54.400 --> 50:56.400
You went from having pizza

50:56.400 --> 50:58.400
simulcrum to this

50:58.400 --> 51:00.400
weird chicken cordon

51:00.400 --> 51:02.400
bleu with no chicken mess.

51:02.400 --> 51:04.400
You've hammed me, sir. You've hammed

51:04.400 --> 51:06.400
me.

51:06.400 --> 51:08.400
God, I hate ham. I've been John Hammed.

51:08.400 --> 51:10.400
Ham, you are so close to being him.

51:10.400 --> 51:12.400
Are you suggesting that John Ham

51:12.400 --> 51:14.400
earned his nom de plume

51:14.400 --> 51:16.400
earned his nom de plume

51:16.400 --> 51:18.400
by going to calzone-serving

51:18.400 --> 51:20.400
restaurants and hiding

51:20.400 --> 51:22.400
his horrible namesake

51:22.400 --> 51:24.400
inside of those sacred pockets of

51:24.400 --> 51:26.400
dough? He's like Johnny Appleseed of

51:26.400 --> 51:28.400
ham.

51:28.400 --> 51:30.400
Oh, Christ.

51:30.400 --> 51:32.400
Johnny Hampleseed.

51:34.400 --> 51:36.400
I totally get it.

51:36.400 --> 51:38.400
This is a tough, tough thing because if you're

51:38.400 --> 51:40.400
in the building...

51:40.400 --> 51:42.400
I'm sorry, I'm still thinking about

51:42.400 --> 51:44.400
getting ham. I'm angry.

51:44.400 --> 51:46.400
When I thought I was getting pepperoni. I'm sorry,

51:46.400 --> 51:48.400
Travis. Go ahead. No, I was just going to say if you're in the

51:48.400 --> 51:50.400
building and it's brought to your table,

51:50.400 --> 51:52.400
it's so easy to be like, oh, I

51:52.400 --> 51:54.400
ordered ham, but

51:54.400 --> 51:56.400
I ordered pepperoni. Even then,

51:56.400 --> 51:58.400
I was with my friend the other day. He ordered

51:58.400 --> 52:00.400
some boneless chicken wings, got bone-in chicken

52:00.400 --> 52:02.400
wings, and the look

52:02.400 --> 52:04.400
on the face of the server when he was like,

52:04.400 --> 52:06.400
oh, they were supposed to be boneless, and you could

52:06.400 --> 52:08.400
clearly see this process of like, oh, I don't

52:08.400 --> 52:10.400
know what to do with these then.

52:10.400 --> 52:12.400
I can't unbone them.

52:12.400 --> 52:14.400
Eventually, he was just like, no,

52:14.400 --> 52:16.400
it's fine. Don't worry about it.

52:16.400 --> 52:18.400
It's fine.

52:18.400 --> 52:20.400
When I started reading this question, I was thinking

52:20.400 --> 52:22.400
almost... I can't

52:22.400 --> 52:24.400
imagine a scenario where I wouldn't just

52:24.400 --> 52:26.400
grin and bear it because for me, the

52:26.400 --> 52:28.400
social discomfort that I would be

52:28.400 --> 52:30.400
causing myself and this person

52:30.400 --> 52:32.400
by sending it back

52:32.400 --> 52:34.400
would be too extreme to stomach.

52:34.400 --> 52:36.400
But not more extreme

52:36.400 --> 52:38.400
to stomach than fucking calzone

52:38.400 --> 52:40.400
ham. That is, I guess,

52:40.400 --> 52:42.400
a bridge too far for this guy.

52:42.400 --> 52:44.400
The bigger concern for me

52:44.400 --> 52:46.400
is not the

52:46.400 --> 52:48.400
awkwardness of the initial exchange.

52:48.400 --> 52:50.400
It's the, okay,

52:50.400 --> 52:52.400
everybody who also got their

52:52.400 --> 52:54.400
food just now, go ahead and eat,

52:54.400 --> 52:56.400
and I'll watch you, and then later,

52:56.400 --> 52:58.400
you'll watch me eat a pepperoni calzone

52:58.400 --> 53:00.400
from dream of

53:00.400 --> 53:02.400
my hamless future.

53:02.400 --> 53:04.400
Now, I will say this.

53:04.400 --> 53:06.400
Even if I didn't send it back,

53:06.400 --> 53:08.400
I would still...

53:08.400 --> 53:10.400
If I was in the restaurant,

53:10.400 --> 53:12.400
if I was dining in, I would still say something.

53:12.400 --> 53:14.400
Because at the very least, my meal should

53:14.400 --> 53:16.400
be discounted because you fucking got it

53:16.400 --> 53:18.400
wrong. But

53:18.400 --> 53:20.400
it's so much tougher with delivery

53:20.400 --> 53:22.400
because unless you open the

53:22.400 --> 53:24.400
box, take a bite of the fucking

53:24.400 --> 53:26.400
hamzone, and drive back

53:26.400 --> 53:28.400
to the... And that is not a good look

53:28.400 --> 53:30.400
to tell the delivery person, like, wait,

53:30.400 --> 53:32.400
one second. Let me taste this first.

53:32.400 --> 53:34.400
You take a bite first.

53:34.400 --> 53:36.400
You take a bite of the king's calzone.

53:36.400 --> 53:40.400
John Ham got me last time.

53:40.400 --> 53:42.400
No, but, like, that idea of, like, if the drivers

53:42.400 --> 53:44.400
are, like, your only option is, like, to drive

53:44.400 --> 53:46.400
to the place.

53:46.400 --> 53:48.400
Chasing him down the street.

53:48.400 --> 53:50.400
Stop, stop! There's been a ham mistake!

53:50.400 --> 53:52.400
Charlton!

53:54.400 --> 53:56.400
Come back! You've stolen my dignity!

53:56.400 --> 53:58.400
Christopher, there's been a ham,

53:58.400 --> 54:00.400
a terrible ham mistake!

54:00.400 --> 54:02.400
You must stop

54:02.400 --> 54:04.400
your vehicle.

54:04.400 --> 54:06.400
Someone summon a ambulance!

54:06.400 --> 54:08.400
On the subject

54:08.400 --> 54:10.400
of

54:10.400 --> 54:12.400
getting the meal discounted

54:12.400 --> 54:14.400
because they made a ham mistake

54:14.400 --> 54:16.400
inside my dough,

54:16.400 --> 54:18.400
I would not worry so much about

54:18.400 --> 54:20.400
immediate fiducial restitution

54:20.400 --> 54:22.400
because I would

54:22.400 --> 54:24.400
sue that establishment for every

54:24.400 --> 54:26.400
goddamn penny that they have.

54:26.400 --> 54:28.400
Walk into the court with, like, a neck

54:28.400 --> 54:30.400
brace on.

54:30.400 --> 54:32.400
I would fucking

54:32.400 --> 54:34.400
take Papa John.

54:34.400 --> 54:36.400
I think that, um,

54:36.400 --> 54:38.400
one of the things that bothers me about

54:38.400 --> 54:40.400
getting the wrong item is when I correct

54:40.400 --> 54:42.400
them, and then they take

54:42.400 --> 54:44.400
the wrong item back.

54:44.400 --> 54:46.400
Like, no, that's mine now.

54:46.400 --> 54:48.400
You put it in

54:48.400 --> 54:50.400
front of—we were at that coffee shop

54:50.400 --> 54:52.400
this weekend across

54:52.400 --> 54:54.400
from the Hotel Kabuki. They gave me the

54:54.400 --> 54:56.400
wrong drink, and I had to

54:56.400 --> 54:58.400
correct them, and then they took that wrong drink

54:58.400 --> 55:00.400
back, and it's like, hold on a second.

55:00.400 --> 55:02.400
This is mine now. I'm gonna

55:02.400 --> 55:04.400
decide what to do with this. You focus on

55:04.400 --> 55:06.400
your thing. I'm gonna decide how I distribute

55:06.400 --> 55:08.400
this. Maybe I wanna split it. I don't

55:08.400 --> 55:10.400
know. You've created an impossible

55:10.400 --> 55:12.400
minefield, but I do think I can eat

55:12.400 --> 55:14.400
around the ham.

55:14.400 --> 55:16.400
It's gonna take me a while.

55:16.400 --> 55:18.400
I might have wanted to cut the crust off and turn it

55:18.400 --> 55:20.400
into breadsticks. You're not the boss of me.

55:20.400 --> 55:22.400
I've actually brought my pet

55:22.400 --> 55:24.400
crow here for this very reason. He

55:24.400 --> 55:26.400
digs into the calzone and

55:26.400 --> 55:28.400
removes the ham so I can enjoy a

55:28.400 --> 55:30.400
ham-free experience. He's my

55:30.400 --> 55:32.400
ham man. He's my ham crow.

55:32.400 --> 55:34.400
If you eat it, you have

55:34.400 --> 55:36.400
just, like, entered into

55:36.400 --> 55:38.400
the situation, the possibility of impropriety,

55:38.400 --> 55:40.400
in that you are creating

55:40.400 --> 55:42.400
ham calzones

55:42.400 --> 55:44.400
with the intent of eating them,

55:44.400 --> 55:46.400
in which case that means

55:46.400 --> 55:48.400
you like ham. Get

55:48.400 --> 55:50.400
outta here. You disgust me. You like secret ham.

55:50.400 --> 55:52.400
You'll never know how much ham will be

55:52.400 --> 55:54.400
in that bite. Enjoy. Secret dirty

55:54.400 --> 55:56.400
free ham. You fucking

55:56.400 --> 55:58.400
monster. You put in the, you're hungry

55:58.400 --> 56:00.400
and you put in the one ingredient you know no one

56:00.400 --> 56:02.400
would ever eat, and that's

56:02.400 --> 56:04.400
ham. And it

56:04.400 --> 56:06.400
all would've worked out if it wasn't

56:06.400 --> 56:08.400
for the one guy who ran down the

56:08.400 --> 56:10.400
street chasing the delivery driver

56:10.400 --> 56:12.400
and unraveled your dastardly ham

56:12.400 --> 56:14.400
plans, John Ham.

56:14.400 --> 56:16.400
Do you think the first person

56:16.400 --> 56:18.400
that fucking, the

56:18.400 --> 56:20.400
calzone guy, everyone was like, well,

56:20.400 --> 56:22.400
we did it. We perfected food. And

56:22.400 --> 56:24.400
then the first person was like, I

56:24.400 --> 56:26.400
can ruin that. Some fucking

56:26.400 --> 56:28.400
gnarled fucking necromancer

56:28.400 --> 56:30.400
was like, I know what to do.

56:30.400 --> 56:32.400
You all seem to be enjoying

56:32.400 --> 56:34.400
your precious calzones.

56:34.400 --> 56:36.400
I think it is a good point

56:36.400 --> 56:38.400
that I think the difference, so like, the difference

56:38.400 --> 56:40.400
between the boneless versus bone-in wings

56:40.400 --> 56:42.400
and this is that

56:42.400 --> 56:44.400
that is just form version

56:44.400 --> 56:46.400
different. This is like content

56:46.400 --> 56:48.400
version different. Where it's like

56:48.400 --> 56:50.400
if you ordered a steak sandwich and they

56:50.400 --> 56:52.400
brought you a chicken sandwich, like

56:52.400 --> 56:54.400
that's a fucking thing. Well, no, because

56:54.400 --> 56:56.400
ham and pepperoni are still technically

56:56.400 --> 56:58.400
cut from the same

56:58.400 --> 57:00.400
delicious cloth. But you understand what I'm saying, this idea of like, I

57:00.400 --> 57:02.400
asked for a specific, this is like

57:02.400 --> 57:04.400
if you ordered buffalo wings and

57:04.400 --> 57:06.400
they brought you teriyaki wings, like

57:06.400 --> 57:08.400
that's a problem.

57:08.400 --> 57:10.400
Like they just got it 100%

57:10.400 --> 57:12.400
wrong. What if, if you got a ham

57:12.400 --> 57:14.400
calzone, could you not just

57:14.400 --> 57:16.400
sort of sit the ham out

57:16.400 --> 57:18.400
and wait for it to turn into pepperoni?

57:18.400 --> 57:20.400
Just

57:20.400 --> 57:22.400
age it in the sun.

57:22.400 --> 57:24.400
The, the inclusion of bones

57:24.400 --> 57:26.400
in the wings is a, makes it a much

57:26.400 --> 57:28.400
is a much bigger jump

57:28.400 --> 57:30.400
I think than pepperoni to

57:30.400 --> 57:32.400
ham. Cause the inclusion of bones in the wings is

57:32.400 --> 57:34.400
ruining the illusion

57:34.400 --> 57:36.400
that I have that

57:36.400 --> 57:38.400
meat just comes from the store.

57:38.400 --> 57:40.400
Right. And that's as much as I have to think about

57:40.400 --> 57:42.400
it. Meat, this meat comes from the store.

57:42.400 --> 57:44.400
See, I hate

57:44.400 --> 57:46.400
the bones cause it slows down my consumption

57:46.400 --> 57:48.400
process.

57:48.400 --> 57:50.400
I gotta work around something.

57:50.400 --> 57:52.400
Not as much as ham slows

57:52.400 --> 57:54.400
down my calzone consumption process

57:54.400 --> 57:56.400
which is to say absolutely.

57:56.400 --> 57:58.400
It absolutely terminates

57:58.400 --> 58:00.400
the process. Absolutely ham zero.

58:00.400 --> 58:02.400
No one's seen Griffin for 40 years.

58:02.400 --> 58:04.400
He took a bite of a ham calzone

58:04.400 --> 58:06.400
and had to retreat into the mountains

58:06.400 --> 58:08.400
to really think about things. He turned into

58:08.400 --> 58:10.400
a jade statuette.

58:10.400 --> 58:12.400
Remember when Griffin

58:12.400 --> 58:14.400
ate that ham accidentally and turned

58:14.400 --> 58:16.400
into a jade statuette

58:16.400 --> 58:18.400
because he didn't want to be alive anymore?

58:20.400 --> 58:22.400
All the best folk stories

58:22.400 --> 58:24.400
start with Griffin eating a ham calzone.

58:26.400 --> 58:28.400
I miss Griffin.

58:28.400 --> 58:30.400
I miss Griffin. Not as much as

58:30.400 --> 58:32.400
I would have liked to share his pepperoni

58:32.400 --> 58:34.400
calzone though. Goddamn.

58:34.400 --> 58:36.400
We were gonna split that. He jumped on that

58:36.400 --> 58:38.400
grenade for me and he turned into a jade

58:38.400 --> 58:40.400
statue. Well if you want to wipe the taste

58:40.400 --> 58:42.400
of ham out of your mouth, go to naturebox.com

58:42.400 --> 58:44.400
We want to thank again

58:44.400 --> 58:46.400
for being a sponsor on the show and you can get something like

58:46.400 --> 58:48.400
barbecue kettle kernels to wash that

58:48.400 --> 58:50.400
terrible, terrible ham taste out of your mouth.

58:50.400 --> 58:52.400
No, no ham guarantee at

58:52.400 --> 58:54.400
naturebox.com slash my brother.

58:54.400 --> 58:56.400
If you want to pretend that your ham is a little

58:56.400 --> 58:58.400
person, go to meonies.com slash my brother

58:58.400 --> 59:00.400
and buy some underwear to put on it.

59:00.400 --> 59:02.400
You get 20% off your

59:02.400 --> 59:04.400
first order and right now you get free shipping

59:04.400 --> 59:06.400
for your ham underwear.

59:06.400 --> 59:08.400
The perfect size for your ham.

59:08.400 --> 59:10.400
Oh Christ. This ham is

59:10.400 --> 59:12.400
really fucking dry. Yeah, I know.

59:12.400 --> 59:14.400
I've been storing it in meonies

59:14.400 --> 59:16.400
and it has moisture wicking properties.

59:16.400 --> 59:18.400
I'm trying to turn it into pepperoni.

59:18.400 --> 59:20.400
Thank you to everybody who came to our

59:20.400 --> 59:22.400
live shows.

59:22.400 --> 59:24.400
In San Francisco and L.A. we had

59:24.400 --> 59:26.400
a real hoot I would say.

59:26.400 --> 59:28.400
It was a hoot nanny if I may be so bold.

59:28.400 --> 59:30.400
Thank you to the folks at

59:30.400 --> 59:32.400
COBS and

59:32.400 --> 59:34.400
the Hollywood Fairfax Cemetery.

59:34.400 --> 59:36.400
Everybody was super, super nice

59:36.400 --> 59:38.400
and really helped us to

59:38.400 --> 59:40.400
get those shows off the ground for you.

59:40.400 --> 59:42.400
And also Sketchfest people were amazing.

59:42.400 --> 59:44.400
If you're going to go into Sketchfest,

59:44.400 --> 59:46.400
you need to go next year because it's incredible.

59:46.400 --> 59:48.400
We will

59:48.400 --> 59:50.400
probably be posting the San Francisco

59:50.400 --> 59:52.400
live show in, I don't know,

59:52.400 --> 59:54.400
in a few weeks. We're kind of keeping it in the chamber

59:54.400 --> 59:56.400
because Justin's about to move

59:56.400 --> 59:58.400
and we'll probably be disconnected

59:58.400 --> 01:00:00.400
from the web for a while.

01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:02.400
We are going to publish that one,

01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:04.400
but it may be a little while.

01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:06.400
We got

01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:08.400
PO Boxes. Mine's 54.

01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:10.400
PO Box 54,

01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:12.400
100 West Virginia 25706.

01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:14.400
Mine is 173469

01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:16.400
Los Angeles, California

01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:18.400
90034.

01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:20.400
There are still

01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:22.400
tickets available for Chicago and Milwaukee

01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:24.400
shows coming up.

01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:26.400
I think it's bit.ly forward slash

01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:28.400
mbmbam Chicago and bit.ly forward slash

01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:30.400
mbmbam what Travis?

01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:32.400
M-I-L.

01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:34.400
So go there. They are very

01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:36.400
close to

01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:38.400
sold out.

01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:40.400
I know that Minneapolis is

01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:42.400
already sold out

01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:44.400
and I'm checking the most recent count

01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:46.400
right now. It looks like we are

01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:48.400
89% sold out in

01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:50.400
Milwaukee and 76%

01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:52.400
sold out in Chicago. So

01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:54.400
if you've been thinking about getting tickets to that,

01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:56.400
do not sleep on that any longer.

01:00:56.400 --> 01:00:58.400
It is time.

01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:00.400
We've received a lot of great questions already,

01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:02.400
but we've got an upcoming episode with Paul

01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:04.400
Scheer as our guestpert.

01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:06.400
If you would like him to answer one of your

01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:08.400
requests for advice, email us

01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:10.400
mbmbam at gmail.com

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:12.400
or mbmbam at maximumfun.org

01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:14.400
and those questions

01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:16.400
should be about Jason Statham movies,

01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:18.400
thank you notes, or weird

01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:20.400
collectibles. Just make sure to put guestpert

01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:22.400
in the subject line so it's easy for me to

01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:24.400
find and that should be

01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:26.400
coming up soon.

01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:28.400
Max Fun Drive is coming up. That is

01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:30.400
the Maximum Fun Network's annual

01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:32.400
two week long

01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:34.400
fundraiser thing.

01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:36.400
I don't know what to call it. But it's a lot of fun.

01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:38.400
We have some bonus length

01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:40.400
episodes. We have a

01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:42.400
extra donor

01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:44.400
only episode.

01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:46.400
And you won't want to miss

01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:48.400
this year's donor only episode

01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:50.400
because it's very special.

01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:52.400
That's all I'll say about it. But yeah, that's

01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:54.400
coming up. What are the dates

01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:56.400
for that? I believe it's the 6th.

01:01:56.400 --> 01:01:58.400
It starts March 16th.

01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:00.400
Okay, starts March 16th and goes for two

01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:02.400
weeks. So it'll be a very special

01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:04.400
time if you're a donor.

01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:06.400
Thank you very much. If you

01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:08.400
have not given to the show and you want to support

01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:10.400
the show, it's a great time to do it. See, it's cool stuff.

01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:12.400
If you've ever tried other shows on the

01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:14.400
network, it's a really great time to check those out

01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:16.400
because everyone's going to be bringing their A game shows

01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:18.400
like Oh No, Ross and Carrie,

01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:20.400
Lady to Lady,

01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:22.400
The Goose Down,

01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:24.400
Flop House, all kinds of wonderful

01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:26.400
shows, including Saw Bones with

01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:28.400
Justin McElroy and Sydney McElroy.

01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:30.400
It's a marital tour of Misguided Medicine.

01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:32.400
It's hilarious. It's Teresa's favorite show on the

01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:34.400
network and one of the few that I am not

01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:36.400
on. So that's cool.

01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:38.400
Okay.

01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:40.400
Yeah, thank you all very, very

01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:42.400
much. And also thanks to John Roderick

01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:44.400
and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song, Is a Departure

01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:46.400
Off the Album, Putting the Days to Bed.

01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:48.400
Are we done?

01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:50.400
I think we're done. Is that it?

01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:52.400
All right, Griffin, one more question. We're going to grow on.

01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:54.400

Can't see their name.

01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:04.400
No username. Okay.

01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:06.400
It's by an anonymous Yahoo Answers user who

01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:08.400
asks, What

01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:12.400

Did you, the listener, like that?

01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:58.400
You were just swept up in a world

01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:00.400
of high fantasy and magic where anything can

01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:02.400
happen and anything is possible.

01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:04.400

Adventure Zone, a new podcast on Maximum

01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:08.400
Fun in which magic and mystery intertwine

01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:10.400
for a very erotically

01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:12.400
charged role-playing experience.

01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:14.400
