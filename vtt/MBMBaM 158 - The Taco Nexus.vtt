00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:48.160
She's a grand old flag, she's a high-flying flag,

00:48.160 --> 00:55.120
forever may she wave over the land of the free, hum of the brave.

00:55.120 --> 00:57.520
Welcome everybody to our fourth of July celebration.

00:57.520 --> 00:59.840
I'm excited. Did you say hum of the brave?

00:59.840 --> 01:08.560
He's like a super patriotic girl talk. He's just like jamming together all the old standards

01:08.560 --> 01:12.080
written by Francis Scott Key. Is that who did it?

01:12.080 --> 01:12.800
Yeah.

01:12.800 --> 01:18.160
If these remix artists are so keen to save us time, like they're always saying,

01:18.160 --> 01:21.120
let's mash up two pop tunes so you can listen to two at once,

01:21.120 --> 01:29.920
shouldn't they have mashed up every holiday theme into one super theme for each holiday?

01:29.920 --> 01:38.000
I'm saying like one Christmas song that's like jingle bells, home for the holidays,

01:39.440 --> 01:41.680
baby Jesus, just hit all the high notes.

01:41.680 --> 01:44.880
Right. See, what's funny is even after doing this show for so long,

01:44.880 --> 01:51.120
I still have things to learn because I had no idea that DJs did remixes for efficiency sake.

01:51.120 --> 01:52.960
They're just trying to save us time.

01:52.960 --> 01:53.280
Okay.

01:54.640 --> 01:57.920
Is that inaccurate? I mean, what other reason could there be?

01:57.920 --> 02:06.080
If Dr. Girl Talk, if DJ Deadmouth wanted to really save us time,

02:06.080 --> 02:08.720
he wouldn't do a mashup for each holiday.

02:08.720 --> 02:16.000
There would be a single, almost like happy birthday-esque tune that you would just do

02:16.000 --> 02:19.280
at any kind of holiday celebration.

02:20.160 --> 02:27.760
And it would just be like, you know, it's time to celebrate, it's time to feel good.

02:27.760 --> 02:30.080
But then like Halloween, that's kind of weird.

02:30.800 --> 02:31.280
Right.

02:31.280 --> 02:32.160
It's time to feel bad.

02:32.160 --> 02:35.280
Oh, what if we just made it like, it's time to observe.

02:35.280 --> 02:37.520
Oh, that's good. It's not a normal day.

02:37.520 --> 02:39.040
It's not a normal day.

02:40.640 --> 02:45.200
Unless you're Jewish for some people and some days.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.280
Just some days overlap.

02:47.920 --> 02:49.040
Let's not cut them out.

02:49.680 --> 02:52.320
Everybody's welcome, but you may not show up.

02:53.520 --> 02:55.360
Here's the verse about Hanukkah.

02:55.360 --> 02:58.880
Some of you can turn it down or just keep listening.

02:58.880 --> 03:00.160
It's got some good rhymes.

03:00.960 --> 03:01.600
Obviously.

03:03.680 --> 03:05.120
Clearly the rhymes are on point.

03:05.120 --> 03:09.120
Maybe you check it on P for this song.

03:09.120 --> 03:12.240
It would be the Hanukkah verse where it would just catch you up and tell you what you missed.

03:15.520 --> 03:16.960
So this is My Brother, My Brother, Me.

03:17.600 --> 03:19.760
It's an observant show for the modern era.

03:19.760 --> 03:22.320
I'm your oldest, most observant brother, Justin McElroy.

03:22.320 --> 03:25.840
I'm your middle-est brother and I'm not that observant, Travis McElroy.

03:25.840 --> 03:27.920
I'm your baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

03:27.920 --> 03:29.600
And I don't care about labels.

03:30.160 --> 03:31.120
You don't care? No?

03:31.680 --> 03:33.440
When it comes to observance.

03:33.440 --> 03:35.600
You care about labels for like expiration dates.

03:35.600 --> 03:37.200
Oh yeah, and like clothes and shit.

03:37.920 --> 03:38.960
Yeah, all that.

03:38.960 --> 03:42.160
Griffin only wears name brand clothing.

03:42.720 --> 03:50.400
Yeah, I'm into Abercrombie and Fitch because it's like the more people protest and boycott it,

03:52.560 --> 03:57.440
it is becoming precipitously more stylish for me to wear it.

03:57.440 --> 03:59.760
Griffin, do you like girls that wear Abercrombie and Fitch?

03:59.760 --> 04:04.960
Yes, but if I had one wish, it would probably be for like, you know, a billion bucks or something like that.

04:04.960 --> 04:05.760
Oh, I see.

04:05.760 --> 04:06.400
If I had that-

04:06.400 --> 04:08.480
You think it's fly when girls stop by for the summer?

04:08.480 --> 04:10.880
No, that's actually- I wish they would call ahead.

04:11.600 --> 04:14.080
I don't think it's too much to ask them to call ahead first.

04:14.080 --> 04:15.520
How long are you staying?

04:16.080 --> 04:18.560
I kind of thought you were just going to swing through.

04:18.560 --> 04:22.480
For the entire- for three goddamn months until the middle of August?

04:22.480 --> 04:25.040
No, no, no.

04:25.040 --> 04:27.280
That's not gonna- listen, I have plans.

04:27.280 --> 04:30.800
I'm going to Myrtle Beach soon, soon.

04:30.800 --> 04:32.400
I can't have you staying there.

04:32.880 --> 04:34.400
Will you at least feed the dogs?

04:34.400 --> 04:36.080
You won't? Damn it.

04:36.080 --> 04:40.080
I like girls that feed my dogs for me when I'm at Myrtle Beach.

04:40.080 --> 04:41.680
They water my plants and bring in the paper.

04:43.680 --> 04:47.360
Please don't steal my Reggie Jackson baseball.

04:47.360 --> 04:48.160
Biceball?

04:48.160 --> 04:50.320
What's he in baseball?

04:50.320 --> 04:52.480
God, was Reggie Jackson a baseball player, please?

04:53.360 --> 04:54.800
I'm sure we'll find out.

04:54.800 --> 04:57.920
Please. I'm sure we'll find out in the post.

04:58.800 --> 05:00.480
I want to help somebody.

05:00.480 --> 05:01.200
Here we go.

05:01.200 --> 05:03.280
I find myself in the need of some advice.

05:03.280 --> 05:06.720
In several weeks, a very good friend of mine is leaving our city to pursue

05:06.720 --> 05:12.320
a Ph.D. or through- I am quite sad he is leaving-

05:12.320 --> 05:14.160
That was a though, not a through.

05:14.960 --> 05:18.080
Though I am quite sad he is leaving my general vicinity,

05:18.640 --> 05:22.240
I am also excited he got into his number one college

05:22.240 --> 05:24.320
and will be studying his favorite subjects.

05:24.320 --> 05:25.120
Here's my problem.

05:26.240 --> 05:28.400
I want to get him something meaningful,

05:28.400 --> 05:32.560
but I don't know what the man version of frame college-

05:32.560 --> 05:33.520
Oh, sorry.

05:33.520 --> 05:34.880
Jesus, Justin.

05:35.440 --> 05:39.200
I don't know what the man version of frame photo collage

05:39.200 --> 05:42.720
of some of our favorite memories with a thoughtful letter written on the back.

05:43.360 --> 05:47.120
What can I get him that will be meaningful but won't be too girly?

05:47.120 --> 05:52.160
P.S. I'm a gay lady, so this isn't about a sad loss of love that could have been.

05:52.160 --> 05:53.520
Thank you, Megan, for clearing that up.

05:53.520 --> 05:58.160
Yeah, because our fucking stupid troglodyte brains would have just been like,

05:58.160 --> 05:59.920
oh, I tell you, you love thing.

05:59.920 --> 06:03.040
You wait, time may stop, baby, let's get this done.

06:03.040 --> 06:05.200
Like, I'm glad that you cleared that up for us.

06:08.160 --> 06:10.000
See, I think that would be a very nice gift.

06:10.000 --> 06:14.880
Yeah, you're kind of casting some dispersions right now,

06:14.880 --> 06:18.960
because like, guys like that shit too.

06:18.960 --> 06:21.120
Is this straightophobia?

06:21.120 --> 06:22.720
Is something going on here?

06:22.720 --> 06:23.920
I think it is.

06:23.920 --> 06:26.000
Is this a case of straightophobia?

06:26.000 --> 06:28.480
What do you call it when you're prejudiced against straight dudes?

06:29.280 --> 06:30.320
I think I just termed it.

06:30.320 --> 06:30.640
Nothing.

06:30.640 --> 06:31.920
It's called nothing at all.

06:31.920 --> 06:33.680
It's called not a thing at all.

06:33.680 --> 06:36.240
It's called not anything that anyone should worry about.

06:37.600 --> 06:38.400
Not a problem.

06:39.360 --> 06:40.240
Everybody's medicine.

06:40.240 --> 06:41.120
You just have to take it.

06:41.920 --> 06:45.520
I mean, I do think that this is one time where, I mean,

06:45.520 --> 06:48.880
she would probably know her friend better than us, one would hope.

06:48.880 --> 06:52.720
So maybe she knows that he wouldn't necessarily be the sort of dude

06:52.720 --> 06:54.560
that would enjoy a frame photo.

06:54.560 --> 06:57.120
He's a Brock Stone chin type.

06:57.920 --> 07:00.560
He's just not interested in frills.

07:00.560 --> 07:02.080
He's too afraid to feel.

07:02.080 --> 07:04.960
Maybe this is the doorway into his emotions, though.

07:04.960 --> 07:07.040
Maybe you give him this key and he's like,

07:07.040 --> 07:09.440
he's just going to feel everything all at once.

07:09.440 --> 07:10.960
Oh, that could be scary, though.

07:11.520 --> 07:12.880
Yeah, that might be a little frightening.

07:12.880 --> 07:14.160
I can get intense.

07:14.160 --> 07:15.840
Can you get him a football or a basketball?

07:15.840 --> 07:19.280
A set of shoulder pads, maybe.

07:19.280 --> 07:21.200
Get this to your new college and dunk it.

07:21.200 --> 07:23.920
Give him a football and write hometown on it.

07:27.840 --> 07:31.360
Why would someone always remember his hometown?

07:32.000 --> 07:32.160
Yeah.

07:32.160 --> 07:33.760
For all the touchdowns you're going to score.

07:34.720 --> 07:35.840
Oh, what if you just say like,

07:37.280 --> 07:40.640
make a touchdown in your doctorate studies.

07:41.680 --> 07:42.480
That's not good.

07:42.480 --> 07:43.680
He's going to get beat up.

07:43.680 --> 07:47.040
Yeah, and also, it's a good point.

07:47.040 --> 07:48.400
Anybody who's getting their doctorate

07:48.400 --> 07:49.680
probably doesn't like football.

07:50.560 --> 07:52.880
I would think maybe not a photo collage, okay?

07:52.880 --> 07:55.120
That's probably a bit much, but maybe a photo.

07:55.120 --> 07:57.840
Something that he could remember you by.

07:57.840 --> 07:59.840
I think that would be kind of nice, actually.

07:59.840 --> 08:02.880
If you guys have a joint favorite movie or TV show,

08:02.880 --> 08:05.760
you could always get him that and that way he'll watch it.

08:07.520 --> 08:09.040
That's such a lazy gift.

08:09.040 --> 08:12.000
More than just printing off a photo and pumping in a frame.

08:12.000 --> 08:15.280
Now, here's the thing about the photo versus photo collage.

08:15.280 --> 08:16.880
If I go to someone's home

08:16.880 --> 08:19.120
and I see a photo of them with a person,

08:20.320 --> 08:21.600
I'll probably won't even ask about it.

08:21.600 --> 08:22.480
I'll probably just think like,

08:22.480 --> 08:25.440
oh, that's a special person.

08:25.440 --> 08:28.400
If I see a photo collage, in my mind, that person died.

08:29.440 --> 08:29.680
Oh, okay.

08:29.680 --> 08:32.320
That's a altar.

08:32.320 --> 08:36.240
Can we do a collage of something that's not photos?

08:37.200 --> 08:39.280
Like words cut out of magazines?

08:39.280 --> 08:40.480
No, not like a fucking-

08:40.480 --> 08:41.680
There's a word for that.

08:41.680 --> 08:43.840
Yeah, that's a ransom note.

08:43.840 --> 08:48.320
I'm thinking more along the lines of lunch meats.

08:49.920 --> 08:50.960
I guess what I'm saying

08:50.960 --> 08:52.640
is that you should get him a tray of lunch meats.

08:53.680 --> 08:54.160
Framed?

08:54.960 --> 08:55.840
Framed if you want,

08:55.840 --> 08:57.920
but it's really just gonna add an extra step

08:57.920 --> 09:00.480
between him and getting partying down on those lunch meats.

09:00.480 --> 09:02.800
If you think about it, that's how Lunchables really are.

09:02.800 --> 09:04.720
Just frame Lunchables.

09:04.720 --> 09:07.040
Get him a box of Lunchables right home town on it.

09:07.040 --> 09:07.840
And send him on his way.

09:07.840 --> 09:10.240
Make it like a bulk box,

09:10.240 --> 09:11.520
because you don't want to get him just one.

09:11.520 --> 09:12.480
You'll look cheap.

09:12.480 --> 09:14.560
Get him a big box from the Costco.

09:15.440 --> 09:17.280
Get him something that's really gonna help him

09:17.280 --> 09:19.920
establish a character at his new college.

09:19.920 --> 09:21.120
He could be the Lunchable guy.

09:22.480 --> 09:24.080
Well, I was gonna say a snake.

09:24.080 --> 09:24.880
Oh, okay.

09:24.880 --> 09:26.160
Get him a snake, and then he's like,

09:26.160 --> 09:27.600
that guy, that's gonna help him get his-

09:27.600 --> 09:30.160
Does anybody want to be that guy?

09:30.880 --> 09:33.360
Does anybody want to be Snake Guy?

09:33.360 --> 09:34.480
Jake the Snake Roberts.

09:34.480 --> 09:35.760
Nobody wants to be Snake Guy,

09:35.760 --> 09:36.880
but somebody has to be Snake Guy.

09:36.880 --> 09:38.800
Jake the Snake Roberts didn't want to be Snake Guy.

09:38.800 --> 09:43.200
He unintentionally built a career around being Snake Guy.

09:43.200 --> 09:45.200
Like, being Snake Guy paid the fucking bills,

09:45.200 --> 09:47.280
but as soon as Jake the Snake Roberts got home,

09:47.280 --> 09:48.880
he threw that snake in the garbage

09:48.880 --> 09:50.080
and bought a new one the next day.

09:50.720 --> 09:52.480
And that kind of frivolity

09:52.480 --> 09:54.800
is what made snake prices go up so high.

09:54.800 --> 09:57.120
And it also ruined Jake the Snake Roberts.

09:57.120 --> 09:58.480
Because he had a house full of snakes.

09:59.200 --> 09:59.440
Well-

10:00.000 --> 10:01.840
They're not gonna stay in the garbage can.

10:01.840 --> 10:05.120
He had a bank account full of snake receipts,

10:05.120 --> 10:05.840
but not money.

10:05.840 --> 10:08.480
And he can't spend snake receipts at the-

10:08.480 --> 10:09.760
at the Piggly Wiggly, you know?

10:12.160 --> 10:14.080
He must have been so excited when he figured out

10:14.080 --> 10:15.440
that Jake and Snake run.

10:20.080 --> 10:20.960
Jake the Lake.

10:20.960 --> 10:21.840
No, no.

10:21.840 --> 10:22.800
Jake the Quake?

10:22.800 --> 10:23.920
Uh, gotta get fat.

10:23.920 --> 10:25.600
That's actually pretty good.

10:25.600 --> 10:26.640
Jake the Quake Roberts?

10:26.640 --> 10:28.640
He would have to get fat for that to work.

10:28.640 --> 10:30.480
You can't be skinny and be the quake.

10:31.120 --> 10:32.000
Jake the Fake.

10:32.000 --> 10:32.960
Oh no, no, no.

10:32.960 --> 10:35.760
It could have been Jake the Quaker and then-

10:35.760 --> 10:37.520
Jaker the Quaker Roberts.

10:37.520 --> 10:38.000
Yeah.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.040
Oh, he outed him.

10:39.040 --> 10:40.000
Oh, he's been outed.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.320
He just dumped oats on him at his finisher.

10:42.320 --> 10:46.000
Okay, we can't keep fucking propagating these stereotypes.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
Like Quakers are into way more shit than just-

10:48.800 --> 10:49.600
I just meant-

10:49.600 --> 10:51.360
I just meant that they don't listen.

10:52.240 --> 10:53.200
You don't know that?

10:53.200 --> 10:54.080
That's probably true.

10:55.600 --> 10:56.720
So I think we're saying-

10:56.720 --> 10:58.640
Listen, if I can't make fun of anybody,

10:58.640 --> 11:01.520
can it be the people that don't listen?

11:02.240 --> 11:02.640
Yeah.

11:02.640 --> 11:04.000
Yeah, because you know what?

11:04.000 --> 11:04.560
Yeah, you know what?

11:04.560 --> 11:05.200
Fuck those people.

11:05.200 --> 11:06.960
They're not even going to give us a shot.

11:06.960 --> 11:08.880
They're not even going to try our podcast.

11:09.760 --> 11:10.240
I'm saying-

11:10.240 --> 11:11.440
I'm not even making fun of Quakers.

11:11.440 --> 11:12.320
I'm saying they're horde.

11:13.040 --> 11:13.840
Quakers are horde.

11:15.840 --> 11:18.240
Oh, by the way, question, Meaghan.

11:18.240 --> 11:19.200
You're welcome.

11:19.200 --> 11:19.360
Yeah.

11:20.160 --> 11:22.880
So give him a photo collage of Jake the Snake Roberts.

11:22.880 --> 11:24.880
Oh my god, that would be awesome.

11:26.560 --> 11:27.680
Ooh, ooh.

11:27.680 --> 11:30.240
Give him the photo collage of Jake the Snake Roberts snake

11:30.240 --> 11:34.240
that got killed by, I wanna say, Brett the Hitman Hart.

11:34.880 --> 11:36.720
Thank you, everybody, for sending in Yahoo's.

11:37.760 --> 11:40.000
This Yahoo was sent in by Scott Ackerman.

11:41.040 --> 11:42.000
Thank you, Scott Ackerman.

11:42.000 --> 11:45.520
It's by Yahoo Answers user ARJ2288, who asks,

11:47.120 --> 11:49.440
how does Shaq have mental conversations?

11:51.920 --> 11:52.560
What?

11:52.560 --> 11:55.200
Shaq claimed at the 2009 NBA draft

11:55.200 --> 11:58.400
that he had mental conversations with LeBron James.

11:58.400 --> 12:01.840
Quote, I haven't had any verbal conversations with LeBron,

12:01.840 --> 12:04.320
but I've had many mental conversations with him.

12:04.320 --> 12:05.360
How is this possible?

12:07.360 --> 12:12.400
The obvious answer is that they are both Tomorrow people.

12:13.360 --> 12:14.160
If you remember that.

12:14.160 --> 12:15.200
Maybe they're both fey.

12:15.200 --> 12:16.320
Maybe they're each half fey.

12:17.520 --> 12:18.800
They might be of-

12:18.800 --> 12:22.960
I've always said that Shaq does seem of the fey wild, but-

12:23.520 --> 12:24.160
If you look at-

12:24.160 --> 12:25.760
If you kind of catch him out of the corner of your eye,

12:25.760 --> 12:26.800
his eyes are all black.

12:26.800 --> 12:27.760
Mm-hmm.

12:27.760 --> 12:29.520
And vampires are always trying to get him.

12:29.520 --> 12:30.020
Yep.

12:33.200 --> 12:37.200
Could it be that they are the same person separated at birth?

12:37.200 --> 12:38.640
No, wait, that doesn't work.

12:38.640 --> 12:39.840
Or time travel.

12:39.840 --> 12:41.840
When Shaq time traveled-

12:41.840 --> 12:42.960
Dimensional travel.

12:44.080 --> 12:45.040
I don't think that's-

12:45.040 --> 12:47.200
I think that's just like movement in space.

12:48.080 --> 12:49.920
I think just walking is dimensional.

12:49.920 --> 12:51.280
I meant like other dimensions.

12:51.280 --> 12:55.760
I know he's a number one jokester of the entire league,

12:55.760 --> 12:59.280
but I think there's probably some truth to this.

13:00.320 --> 13:01.200
I think there's probably-

13:01.200 --> 13:05.120
I don't think you get to be the hugest man on earth

13:05.120 --> 13:07.920
and not also be evolved in other,

13:09.840 --> 13:12.240
perhaps more supernatural ways.

13:12.240 --> 13:14.880
So what are you implying here, Griffin?

13:15.920 --> 13:17.760
I am implying that

13:17.760 --> 13:25.120
Shaquille O'Neal is a mutant.

13:25.120 --> 13:28.320
He is homo superior, is what I'm saying.

13:28.320 --> 13:28.820
I see.

13:30.320 --> 13:32.160
Not only in terms of dunking,

13:32.160 --> 13:33.360
but in terms of like,

13:33.360 --> 13:34.720
he can probably move shit with his mind.

13:34.720 --> 13:35.760
Now, here's the thing, though.

13:35.760 --> 13:38.240
If you believe in a fair and just God,

13:38.240 --> 13:40.720
do you honestly believe that he would create a human being

13:40.720 --> 13:45.280
that is both gigantic and has hyperkinesia?

13:45.280 --> 13:48.640
Hyperkinesis is ADD, so do you want something else?

13:48.640 --> 13:49.200
Yes, it did.

13:50.160 --> 13:51.120
But I can't remember the word,

13:51.120 --> 13:52.960
so I'm sticking with hyperkinesis.

13:52.960 --> 13:53.920
Okay, cool.

13:53.920 --> 13:56.480
Griffin, I think if Shaq could move things with his mind,

13:56.480 --> 13:58.800
then he'd probably be able to hit one from the three.

13:58.800 --> 13:59.280
What?

13:59.280 --> 14:01.040
If you guys know what I'm talking about.

14:01.040 --> 14:02.000
Taco nexus.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.280
You know what you're talking about?

14:05.280 --> 14:07.040
Griffin, I didn't hear what you were saying.

14:07.040 --> 14:08.000
I said taco-

14:08.000 --> 14:09.920
I thought you said taco nexus.

14:09.920 --> 14:12.000
I said taco nexus.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.840
I thought you said taco nexus.

14:13.840 --> 14:15.840
I said taco nexus.

14:15.840 --> 14:16.880
Taco nexus syndrome.

14:16.880 --> 14:21.120
You remember that commercial where Shaq eats the tacos?

14:21.760 --> 14:24.000
You guys not remember taco nexus syndrome?

14:24.000 --> 14:25.920
I can't believe I have to explain to the two of you.

14:26.960 --> 14:28.400
Of all people, what taco nexus is.

14:28.400 --> 14:31.760
Prominent watchers of television and eaters of food.

14:31.760 --> 14:33.440
Known Taco Bell enthusiasts.

14:34.560 --> 14:38.000
There's a commercial where Shaq was shooting threes.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.040
This is gonna be funny.

14:39.040 --> 14:40.640
He's making all of them.

14:40.640 --> 14:43.040
He's making all the threes, which he's not known for.

14:43.040 --> 14:44.640
I guess it's not his core competency.

14:45.280 --> 14:45.760
Right.

14:45.760 --> 14:47.360
And it pans back-

14:47.360 --> 14:48.720
Or is it foul shots?

14:48.720 --> 14:49.760
Is that what he has a problem with?

14:49.760 --> 14:50.400
No, it's a three.

14:50.400 --> 14:51.760
It's hitting it in the paint.

14:51.760 --> 14:53.280
I think it's hitting it in the paint.

14:53.280 --> 14:54.480
Well, he takes it to the paint.

14:54.480 --> 14:56.720
He keeps it in the paint, but he doesn't-

14:56.720 --> 14:59.520
Once he's there, he has no fucking idea what to do with it.

14:59.520 --> 15:02.080
Except just like run at the basket as fast as he can

15:02.080 --> 15:03.360
and just sort of bull rush it.

15:03.360 --> 15:06.800
And he's the size of two full grown men.

15:06.800 --> 15:08.560
So like there's no stopping him.

15:08.560 --> 15:10.560
But if he has to make it from the paint,

15:10.560 --> 15:13.840
then he's in a world of trouble.

15:13.840 --> 15:15.040
Anyway, cuts back to him-

15:15.040 --> 15:16.240
You're talking about taco nexus.

15:16.960 --> 15:19.680
He's making all these sweet threes and pans back,

15:19.680 --> 15:21.360
and his neck is like tilted to one side.

15:21.360 --> 15:22.000
And they're like, what?

15:22.000 --> 15:22.720
How did it happen?

15:23.280 --> 15:27.520
And some doctor is like, he's got taco neck syndrome.

15:27.520 --> 15:31.920
And when you tilt your head so you don't tilt the taco,

15:31.920 --> 15:36.000
you tilt your head so you don't lose any of the sweet meats in there.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.480
He has Doritos Locos taco syndrome.

15:38.480 --> 15:39.520
Do you mean diabetes?

15:39.520 --> 15:40.240
Yes, I do.

15:40.240 --> 15:42.720
No, that's just when you get crumble fingers.

15:43.360 --> 15:46.320
America, it's your friend Justin McElroy.

15:47.200 --> 15:48.880
Just tilt the taco.

15:49.520 --> 15:50.400
Trust me, you can lose-

15:50.400 --> 15:52.800
We have to stop taco neck syndrome.

15:52.800 --> 15:54.160
Of the cheese shreds.

15:55.440 --> 15:57.280
Man, can you imagine how funny this would have been

15:57.280 --> 15:59.600
if that commercial was still on or had been on

15:59.600 --> 16:01.200
in this presidential administration?

16:03.840 --> 16:04.400
Do you think-

16:04.400 --> 16:05.600
Hey guys, where's the beef?

16:07.280 --> 16:07.600
Fuck.

16:08.320 --> 16:09.760
Cut it out, Justin.

16:09.760 --> 16:10.960
Cut it out.

16:10.960 --> 16:14.240
Do you think that playing basketball with somebody enough

16:14.880 --> 16:17.760
sort of gives you that sort of instinctive,

16:17.760 --> 16:23.600
like sort of gives you a form of extra sensory perception

16:23.600 --> 16:25.440
as to what that person is thinking?

16:25.440 --> 16:28.160
Because like if the three of us played basketball with each other

16:28.160 --> 16:31.040
our entire lives as opposed to just the four or five times

16:31.040 --> 16:32.480
that we did it in the basketball court

16:32.480 --> 16:34.480
that we had in our backyard for some reason.

16:35.520 --> 16:37.600
Like whenever we get on the court,

16:37.600 --> 16:42.640
like I would know if Travis wants me to get free

16:42.640 --> 16:44.800
and get in the paint, you know what I mean?

16:44.800 --> 16:47.520
I would know when Justin is about to run up for a dunk

16:47.520 --> 16:49.280
and needs me to set him up for a layup.

16:49.280 --> 16:50.640
Maybe you should just always assume

16:50.640 --> 16:52.480
that I want you to get free and get in the paint.

16:53.280 --> 16:54.720
If I'm going to run in for a dunk,

16:54.720 --> 16:55.840
why are you going to put me in for-

16:55.840 --> 17:00.000
Oh, so I'm going to dish you the rock, basically.

17:00.000 --> 17:04.080
Or you could fake dish it, you could fake left

17:04.080 --> 17:05.360
and then dish right.

17:05.360 --> 17:08.160
You know how in NBA Jam, sometimes you go up

17:08.160 --> 17:10.240
and you jump up in the air to like dunk it

17:10.240 --> 17:14.480
and then you somehow throw the ball behind your head

17:14.480 --> 17:17.760
without moving your arms at like 200 miles an hour?

17:17.760 --> 17:18.560
Uh-huh.

17:18.560 --> 17:21.680
That's the kind of maneuver that I'm banking on you doing.

17:21.680 --> 17:23.280
But I don't need to fucking tell you this

17:23.280 --> 17:25.680
because we've been playing basketball together for so long

17:25.680 --> 17:28.400
that we have a psychic tether.

17:29.040 --> 17:32.960
Wait, maybe Kobe and Shaq are communicating-

17:32.960 --> 17:33.520
LeBron.

17:33.520 --> 17:37.440
But LeBron doesn't play on the same team, does he?

17:37.440 --> 17:39.600
LeBron, and it doesn't matter.

17:39.600 --> 17:41.520
LeBron and Shaq are communicating,

17:41.520 --> 17:44.960
but the way this communication is actually through basketball.

17:44.960 --> 17:47.440
Maybe when he was missing all those sweet threes,

17:47.440 --> 17:51.600
Shaq was actually using an advanced form of communication

17:51.600 --> 17:54.480
to send a message to LeBron.

17:54.480 --> 17:55.200
You know what I'm saying?

17:55.200 --> 17:55.920
Like a code.

17:56.480 --> 17:57.600
It's a code, right?

17:57.600 --> 18:00.480
Like he misses three threes in a row

18:00.480 --> 18:04.080
and LeBron's like, ah, sense of disturbance in the basketball force.

18:04.640 --> 18:08.000
I know that I can't, I forget what we were saying,

18:08.720 --> 18:10.080
get drafted by somebody.

18:10.080 --> 18:11.600
I don't really understand basketball.

18:11.600 --> 18:13.520
I actually, I prefer to think of it

18:13.520 --> 18:16.000
like with them not being on the same team

18:16.000 --> 18:19.440
that like Shaquille misses a three and like thinks really hard.

18:19.440 --> 18:21.360
Like I'm really sad that I missed that three

18:21.360 --> 18:24.080
and LeBron from like across the country thinks back like,

18:24.080 --> 18:25.200
it'll be okay, man.

18:25.200 --> 18:26.240
You'll get it next time.

18:26.240 --> 18:27.840
And he feels a little bit better.

18:27.840 --> 18:29.440
Yeah, because they're all a lot better.

18:29.440 --> 18:30.800
They're not on the same team.

18:30.800 --> 18:32.080
They're not on the same team,

18:32.080 --> 18:33.760
but they're, you know, they're all on this together.

18:33.760 --> 18:36.000
Yeah, they're on a team I like to call the human race.

18:36.640 --> 18:40.720
Yeah, I'm also the National Basketball Association.

18:40.720 --> 18:41.680
There's that.

18:41.680 --> 18:44.080
That's a slightly smaller fraternity, but sure.

18:45.360 --> 18:46.480
Hey, I wanna help somebody else.

18:46.480 --> 18:47.280
Here we go.

18:47.280 --> 18:49.120
I'm a full-time yoga instructor.

18:49.120 --> 18:52.160
I have dated a few girls who come into the yoga studio

18:52.160 --> 18:53.760
and it always ends up not working out.

18:54.560 --> 18:56.720
I get the impression they expect me to be different

18:56.720 --> 18:58.080
from other guys they've dated.

18:58.080 --> 18:59.600
And in a lot of ways I am.

19:01.600 --> 19:02.720
I mean, I'm pretty great.

19:03.920 --> 19:06.160
I'm pretty great and I'm bendy and shit, I guess.

19:09.520 --> 19:12.800
I think in their mind, I sit around and meditate all day.

19:12.800 --> 19:14.800
How do I give them a reasonable expectation

19:14.800 --> 19:17.040
of who I am outside the yoga studio?

19:17.040 --> 19:19.600
Or should I stop dating girls from there all together?

19:20.160 --> 19:22.880
And that's from Let's Namaste Friends.

19:25.200 --> 19:26.640
Question of the year nominee.

19:26.640 --> 19:28.240
Yeah, 2013.

19:28.240 --> 19:29.440
Pretty good so far.

19:29.440 --> 19:31.120
Hey, listen, just from me to you,

19:31.120 --> 19:33.040
as somebody who's been down the show before,

19:33.040 --> 19:35.440
maybe you start by thinking of them as women.

19:35.440 --> 19:36.080
Oh, nice.

19:37.280 --> 19:37.840
Think about it.

19:37.840 --> 19:38.720
Next question.

19:38.720 --> 19:40.160
Hate to put you on blast.

19:40.160 --> 19:41.440
I hate to put you on blast.

19:43.120 --> 19:44.960
Could you sneak it into your yoga lessons

19:44.960 --> 19:46.640
where you're like, okay, we're gonna do downward dog.

19:46.640 --> 19:47.760
Everyone breathe.

19:47.760 --> 19:50.000
Also, did anyone check out Breaking Bad last night?

19:50.000 --> 19:51.280
That's pretty cool, right?

19:51.280 --> 19:52.960
Anyways, and just move on.

19:52.960 --> 19:53.280
I mean-

19:53.280 --> 19:54.720
That's a lot of pressure

19:54.720 --> 19:56.960
because I think that what he's ignoring

19:56.960 --> 20:00.320
is not his behaviors so much as they're gonna,

20:01.120 --> 20:05.040
they're gonna expect him to know some positions.

20:05.040 --> 20:08.880
They're gonna expect him to give them some predicaments.

20:08.880 --> 20:11.200
I don't think that's what he's talking about.

20:11.200 --> 20:11.680
I don't think-

20:11.680 --> 20:13.120
I don't think it is either.

20:14.720 --> 20:16.400
That is not the context of the question.

20:16.400 --> 20:19.040
Sometimes I don't think about things before I say them.

20:19.040 --> 20:19.440
Sure.

20:19.440 --> 20:19.920
Come on.

20:20.560 --> 20:21.680
You know me better than this.

20:21.680 --> 20:24.640
I was using basketball telepathy to tell you I was sorry.

20:24.640 --> 20:26.080
You were trying to take it to the paint.

20:26.080 --> 20:28.960
What if while he was teaching yoga,

20:28.960 --> 20:31.760
periodically he would stop and just like,

20:32.320 --> 20:33.440
chomp some Pringles?

20:36.720 --> 20:37.680
Just like in the middle.

20:37.680 --> 20:39.600
I mean, if it's like Bikram hot yoga,

20:39.600 --> 20:42.240
like you're probably not gonna want a salty snack

20:42.800 --> 20:43.520
in the middle of it.

20:43.520 --> 20:45.040
I can't imagine doing hot yoga

20:45.040 --> 20:46.320
and wanting to smell Pringles,

20:46.320 --> 20:47.280
let alone eat them.

20:48.240 --> 20:48.740
I-

20:49.600 --> 20:51.360
And can you do it when they're in a position

20:51.360 --> 20:52.800
and they're not facing you?

20:52.800 --> 20:54.640
So they're waiting for you to tell them?

20:54.640 --> 20:55.760
They just hear-

20:57.360 --> 20:58.800
Well, first they'll hear that pop,

20:58.800 --> 20:59.760
that telltale pop.

21:01.680 --> 21:03.600
Just go from ear to ear whispering,

21:03.600 --> 21:04.480
listen, I popped.

21:04.480 --> 21:05.760
Now I can't stop.

21:05.760 --> 21:07.440
I'm gonna need like 15, 20 minutes

21:07.440 --> 21:08.400
to clear the cache here.

21:08.400 --> 21:09.280
They'll hear the pop,

21:09.280 --> 21:10.000
they'll hear a whiff,

21:10.000 --> 21:11.200
they'll hear yummy.

21:11.200 --> 21:12.000
That's all they're gonna hear.

21:12.000 --> 21:12.880
And then just walk by

21:12.880 --> 21:14.720
and like gently adjust their positions,

21:14.720 --> 21:17.120
but really you're wiping your fingers off on their shit.

21:18.240 --> 21:20.160
That's a good way to set the bar real low.

21:20.160 --> 21:22.080
I got some sour cream dust.

21:22.080 --> 21:23.200
I'm just gonna-

21:23.200 --> 21:24.320
Okay, great.

21:24.320 --> 21:25.760
You're gonna want to wash this, Matt.

21:26.320 --> 21:27.840
You can call me though if you want to.

21:27.840 --> 21:29.200
I'm just like every other guy.

21:29.200 --> 21:30.000
Hey, do you want a date?

21:31.440 --> 21:32.240
Do you want a chip?

21:34.960 --> 21:36.640
Just kidding, I popped,

21:36.640 --> 21:38.480
so I legally couldn't stop.

21:38.480 --> 21:40.720
I slammed all those delicious Pringles.

21:40.720 --> 21:42.880
They have a lot of flavors of Pringles.

21:42.880 --> 21:43.120
They do.

21:43.120 --> 21:44.160
When was the last time you guys checked?

21:44.160 --> 21:46.720
They have like spicy dill pickle.

21:46.720 --> 21:49.600
It's extreme dill pickle, Justin, please.

21:49.600 --> 21:50.720
Aww.

21:50.720 --> 21:51.920
I fucking love Pringles.

21:51.920 --> 21:52.800
Here's what you do.

21:52.800 --> 21:55.120
You get the extreme dill, right?

21:55.120 --> 21:57.920
Can we not do a Pringles cooking segment

21:57.920 --> 21:58.000
in the middle of our show?

21:58.000 --> 21:59.680
And then you shuffle them together, right?

21:59.680 --> 22:02.960
So you get dill and ranch in the same bite.

22:03.760 --> 22:05.200
I just think we're gonna enter a future

22:05.200 --> 22:07.680
where all of our meals are delivered via Pringles.

22:07.680 --> 22:10.800
I mean, it is the best way to do,

22:10.800 --> 22:13.200
to transfer that particular food stuff,

22:13.200 --> 22:15.280
but can we just not put,

22:15.280 --> 22:16.320
can we not wait?

22:16.320 --> 22:18.720
Can we not just enjoy these last remaining years

22:18.720 --> 22:21.440
before all of our things come in cans

22:21.440 --> 22:22.560
in convex shapes?

22:23.600 --> 22:24.960
You know, technically,

22:25.680 --> 22:27.440
Pringles aren't chips, they're crisps.

22:27.440 --> 22:28.160
Oh, come on.

22:28.160 --> 22:30.720
They're reconstituted potato flakes.

22:30.720 --> 22:32.160
And that was, they used to call them chips

22:32.160 --> 22:32.800
in the potato chip.

22:32.800 --> 22:33.680
There was a big lawsuit.

22:34.240 --> 22:36.080
Yeah, it's got really bad.

22:36.080 --> 22:39.280
Who the fuck eats a Pringles like,

22:39.280 --> 22:40.560
oh, what the fuck?

22:40.560 --> 22:42.320
I was told there would be chips.

22:42.960 --> 22:45.520
Nobody, but thanks lobbyists, you know?

22:45.520 --> 22:47.680
You know, Griffin, if you ever watched Unwrapped,

22:47.680 --> 22:48.480
you would know that.

22:49.200 --> 22:51.120
Yeah, well, I mean, if they,

22:52.640 --> 22:54.560
I understand that they would think that,

22:54.560 --> 22:57.120
but also that's kind of on them.

22:57.120 --> 22:58.800
I mean, why would they assume

22:58.800 --> 23:00.720
that you would just yoga all the time?

23:01.600 --> 23:04.720
My girl likes to do yoga all the time.

23:04.720 --> 23:07.520
Yeah, you can't live a yoga lifestyle

23:07.520 --> 23:08.400
24 hours a day.

23:08.400 --> 23:10.080
I mean, I know some people are out there doing it,

23:10.080 --> 23:12.080
but he's just like any other guy.

23:12.080 --> 23:13.600
And if they assume otherwise

23:13.600 --> 23:16.560
because of one facet of their personality,

23:16.560 --> 23:18.720
you know, I think that they're not the person

23:18.720 --> 23:19.840
you were gonna end up with anyway.

23:19.840 --> 23:20.960
But I totally get it,

23:20.960 --> 23:22.400
because this is like the one,

23:24.160 --> 23:30.640
this career is completely characterized

23:31.200 --> 23:36.560
by soft speech and like a sort of enlightenment.

23:36.560 --> 23:40.000
Like, I don't do yoga, of course.

23:40.000 --> 23:41.760
Like, look at my, just look at my body.

23:41.760 --> 23:42.880
Look at what I'm working with.

23:42.880 --> 23:44.960
This is not a yoga body.

23:44.960 --> 23:45.680
It just isn't.

23:45.680 --> 23:47.040
I tried to do yoga.

23:47.040 --> 23:49.040
Day one, the instructor was like,

23:49.040 --> 23:51.120
I'm sorry, that is not a yoga body.

23:51.120 --> 23:51.920
I need you to go.

23:53.280 --> 23:55.200
You're making everybody else feel bad for you.

23:55.200 --> 23:56.560
Isn't that something you build to?

23:57.120 --> 23:57.440
No.

23:57.440 --> 23:58.720
You just have it or you don't?

23:58.720 --> 24:01.920
No, it's like, are you an endomorph or an ectomorph?

24:01.920 --> 24:05.520
Like, it's based entirely on your body shape.

24:05.520 --> 24:06.480
I'm an o-morph.

24:08.320 --> 24:11.120
It means my body, like I can maintain,

24:11.120 --> 24:13.760
but I can't get any better than where I'm at right now.

24:13.760 --> 24:15.600
Anyway, I don't want to talk about that anymore.

24:15.600 --> 24:18.560
What I'm saying is that this is a career

24:18.560 --> 24:20.480
determined by enlightenment.

24:20.480 --> 24:24.240
And so you put out this facade of enlightenment

24:24.240 --> 24:26.960
that people, like you can't just like get in your car

24:26.960 --> 24:28.800
and like throw in a Brooks and Dunc cassette.

24:28.800 --> 24:29.760
Like, people are gonna-

24:29.760 --> 24:31.600
But the difference is like, you're not,

24:32.320 --> 24:35.440
you're not like a Buddhist Zen teacher.

24:36.320 --> 24:38.080
You're a yoga teacher.

24:38.640 --> 24:39.520
Right, but you still have to-

24:39.520 --> 24:41.920
Like, that's where I get confused by the like,

24:41.920 --> 24:44.560
kind of assumption of enlightenment.

24:44.560 --> 24:45.840
I don't think that it's the same deal.

24:45.840 --> 24:47.680
But there's no yoga instructor who's like,

24:47.680 --> 24:49.600
all right guys, let's fucking do this.

24:49.600 --> 24:51.920
I would go to that yoga class though.

24:51.920 --> 24:54.320
Throws on the Mortal Kombat soundtrack and is like,

24:54.320 --> 24:55.280
bend your butt.

24:56.640 --> 24:57.920
Put your butt on your back.

24:59.760 --> 25:00.400
Liu Kang.

25:02.640 --> 25:05.200
Put your butt in the air and hold it there.

25:05.200 --> 25:05.920
Coward.

25:05.920 --> 25:07.840
Make sure to maintain your breathing.

25:07.840 --> 25:11.200
Right in.

25:11.200 --> 25:15.360
There's one part of the email that I neglected to read

25:15.920 --> 25:18.400
that sort of disproves his question.

25:18.400 --> 25:20.000
Because he says, I'm still a guy.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.240
I like to watch the Simpsons, pro sports,

25:22.240 --> 25:24.960
and sometimes when I nap, I fart in my sleep.

25:24.960 --> 25:26.800
And you know what, I thought about it,

25:26.800 --> 25:30.880
and you have got to be really in touch with your body

25:30.880 --> 25:32.480
to know if you fart when you sleep.

25:33.840 --> 25:36.880
You just wake up and just write in your dream journal,

25:36.880 --> 25:40.240
six, six of them today.

25:40.240 --> 25:43.680
Oh no, the number is increasing.

25:43.680 --> 25:46.080
Every time he toots, he has to say namaste.

25:46.080 --> 25:48.640
And so he wakes himself up.

25:48.640 --> 25:50.560
I think he probably says namaste.

25:55.280 --> 25:56.160
Stupid.

25:56.160 --> 26:00.240
Let's take it from an urban setting to a more rural.

26:01.440 --> 26:01.940
Fuck.

26:01.940 --> 26:07.060
Let's take it from an urban setting to a more rural one

26:07.060 --> 26:08.180
with farm wisdom.

26:09.860 --> 26:11.700
You know, I really can't introduce the bit

26:11.700 --> 26:14.020
and then sing the theme song and then take it up.

26:14.020 --> 26:15.540
That's like a three person job

26:15.540 --> 26:17.460
that I'm trying to take on to myself.

26:17.460 --> 26:23.700
It's uniquely American, but farm wisdom, farm wisdom.

26:24.580 --> 26:26.820
Pick up your pitch for farm wisdom.

26:28.260 --> 26:28.740
Are you done?

26:28.740 --> 26:30.420
I can never tell when you're done.

26:30.420 --> 26:31.860
You end with upward inflection.

26:33.140 --> 26:34.820
Like you're asking a question in song.

26:35.700 --> 26:37.460
This first one comes from Johnny and Johnny says,

26:37.460 --> 26:40.180
if you have a problem with rabbits messing your garden up,

26:40.180 --> 26:42.580
spread human hair throughout the soil.

26:42.580 --> 26:44.580
Rabbits hate the smell of human hair.

26:44.580 --> 26:46.820
Hey, this is some pretty cool stew you made.

26:46.820 --> 26:49.060
This is some really cool vegetable stew that you made.

26:49.060 --> 26:49.940
One issue though.

26:51.140 --> 26:53.460
It looks like a dad's chest in my bowl right now.

26:53.460 --> 26:55.540
And I don't know what the fuck's going on.

26:55.540 --> 26:57.860
You could probably like go to a barbershop

26:57.860 --> 26:59.380
and get like their clippings like that.

26:59.380 --> 27:00.580
You have to use your own hair.

27:00.580 --> 27:04.100
And I imagine you wash the vegetables before you use them.

27:04.100 --> 27:05.700
Yeah, do you mind if I just come to the barber?

27:05.700 --> 27:06.660
Hey, barber.

27:06.660 --> 27:07.220
Hi, barber.

27:07.220 --> 27:08.660
Thanks for taking my call.

27:08.660 --> 27:09.140
Real quick.

27:09.140 --> 27:11.540
I was wondering if I could do one thing

27:11.540 --> 27:13.940
that might be a little strange.

27:14.580 --> 27:15.700
Can I have all the hair?

27:15.700 --> 27:16.900
I brought my own bag.

27:16.900 --> 27:17.780
It's reusable.

27:17.780 --> 27:21.140
I brought my own bag and a little scooper.

27:21.940 --> 27:22.740
Just get in there.

27:22.740 --> 27:26.260
I, does it twist anybody else's perception

27:26.260 --> 27:29.300
of the human rabbit relationship?

27:29.300 --> 27:31.220
If you know that every time like a child

27:31.220 --> 27:33.060
picks up a little bunny, that bunny is thinking,

27:33.060 --> 27:36.580
ugh, you stinky bastard.

27:36.580 --> 27:37.940
Oh, what is that smell?

27:37.940 --> 27:39.300
Oh God, is that you?

27:39.300 --> 27:40.580
Oh, he's going to kiss me.

27:40.580 --> 27:44.660
Oh, I'm going to smell like this for days.

27:44.660 --> 27:45.940
I can't get this out of my snoot.

27:46.900 --> 27:48.980
This next one comes from Alyssa who says,

27:48.980 --> 27:51.620
did you know that if you see a bull snake around your house,

27:51.620 --> 27:53.940
that means you don't have any rattlesnakes around?

27:53.940 --> 27:56.580
Bull snakes will murder the fuck out of them.

27:56.580 --> 27:57.300
Thank you, Alyssa.

27:57.300 --> 27:58.900
If I see a bull snake around my house,

27:58.900 --> 28:00.820
it also means that I don't own that house anymore.

28:04.660 --> 28:05.220
Yeah.

28:05.220 --> 28:07.940
My reaction whenever I see a snake is never like,

28:07.940 --> 28:08.820
oh, great.

28:09.860 --> 28:10.820
Fantastic.

28:10.820 --> 28:13.060
Because what that basically is telling you

28:13.060 --> 28:14.500
is the thing that can kill,

28:14.500 --> 28:16.180
the thing that can kill you,

28:16.180 --> 28:17.300
it lives in your house.

28:18.980 --> 28:21.780
Let me identify that so I know how to react to it.

28:21.780 --> 28:24.660
No, can't I just have a ricky-ticky-tabby

28:24.660 --> 28:25.700
running around my house?

28:25.700 --> 28:27.060
That would be fine.

28:27.060 --> 28:27.540
Yeah.

28:27.540 --> 28:28.900
Adorable little mongoose.

28:29.860 --> 28:31.780
Now somebody's going to tell me the mongooses are mean.

28:32.580 --> 28:34.740
They're probably not monkeys, first off.

28:34.740 --> 28:37.700
And they're also probably not like the friendliest creatures.

28:38.740 --> 28:40.820
They're bred to, they are bred to fight.

28:40.820 --> 28:41.780
You know what I mean?

28:41.780 --> 28:43.300
They're bred to kill snakes.

28:43.300 --> 28:43.940
Yeah.

28:43.940 --> 28:46.420
Anything whose main diet can,

28:46.420 --> 28:50.180
if like, if the only thing I ate was great white sharks,

28:50.180 --> 28:52.340
you probably wouldn't want to like chill with me.

28:52.900 --> 28:54.180
I disagree.

28:54.180 --> 28:55.460
I think you'd be like the coolest.

28:55.460 --> 28:57.140
I'd have so many questions.

28:57.140 --> 28:57.380
Yeah.

28:57.940 --> 28:58.980
What's it taste like?

28:58.980 --> 29:00.260
How do you get a steady supply?

29:00.820 --> 29:01.860
Can I have some?

29:01.860 --> 29:02.100
No.

29:02.660 --> 29:04.340
Aren't those endangered?

29:04.340 --> 29:05.780
Are you in prison?

29:05.780 --> 29:07.780
They're endangered-er now.

29:10.420 --> 29:13.380
With every bite, with every bite.

29:13.380 --> 29:14.660
A little more endangered.

29:14.660 --> 29:19.300
There are only a hundred thousand and eight point four left

29:19.300 --> 29:22.100
because I am halfway through this meal.

29:22.660 --> 29:24.100
You could actually come back.

29:24.100 --> 29:26.500
I think they're big enough that you could just catch one,

29:27.140 --> 29:29.540
grab a couple of fillets, ice them down,

29:29.540 --> 29:31.060
and then release them back in the wild.

29:31.060 --> 29:31.700
Let him heal up.

29:31.700 --> 29:33.620
Now the great white's going to be pissed.

29:33.620 --> 29:33.780
Yeah.

29:33.780 --> 29:36.020
He's going to be, that's why they're all so angry

29:36.020 --> 29:50.100
because Griffin keeps stealing fillets from them.

29:50.100 --> 29:51.540
Pat, who's this first message for?

29:51.540 --> 29:53.060
This first message is for Wilson.

29:53.700 --> 29:56.260
Well, then it could only be from Ryan, I assume.

29:56.260 --> 29:57.620
They're like buds forever.

29:57.620 --> 29:59.940
Griffin, I want you to read this with the appropriate inflection.

30:01.620 --> 30:02.420
Hey, Wilson.

30:02.420 --> 30:05.060
Yeah, you, Wilson.

30:06.020 --> 30:06.820
I don't know what to write.

30:06.820 --> 30:07.700
What do you want me to do?

30:07.700 --> 30:08.420
You're doing great.

30:08.420 --> 30:08.980
Yeah, keep going.

30:08.980 --> 30:09.700
You're doing great.

30:09.700 --> 30:11.540
Is this freaking you out?

30:11.540 --> 30:12.340
I bet it is.

30:12.900 --> 30:16.500
Happy 21st birthday, you magnificent son of a bitch.

30:16.500 --> 30:19.220
I like to imagine that right now they're in the same car

30:19.220 --> 30:22.820
and Ryan just staring at him with a knife.

30:24.340 --> 30:26.340
This is the last thing that happens.

30:26.340 --> 30:28.180
Can we get one money zone that's just like,

30:28.180 --> 30:29.140
this is how it ends.

30:29.140 --> 30:29.940
Happy birthday.

30:29.940 --> 30:31.460
Okay.

30:31.460 --> 30:32.980
I'll be waiting for you at home.

30:32.980 --> 30:34.100
The trap is sprung.

30:36.420 --> 30:37.220
Thank you.

30:37.220 --> 30:38.260
Thank you to both of you.

30:39.140 --> 30:42.900
Your friendship sounds deeply, grossly rewarding.

30:45.220 --> 30:46.980
Speaking of grossly rewarding,

30:46.980 --> 30:49.860
let's talk about ExtremeRestraints.com.

30:49.860 --> 30:55.220
It's an adult superstore where you can find a whole cornucopia of sexual delight.

30:55.220 --> 30:55.860
H-O-L-E.

30:56.740 --> 30:57.380
H-O-L-E.

30:57.380 --> 31:01.220
H-O-L-E. Travis, you have a list, right?

31:01.220 --> 31:02.980
Of our new coupon code, by the way.

31:02.980 --> 31:05.700
It's going to save you 20% as sexabunga.

31:05.700 --> 31:08.740
And Travis, I feel like you have heard,

31:10.100 --> 31:12.820
you've gotten a communique from the ExtremeRestraints.com

31:13.380 --> 31:16.660
of some of the items that have been purchased with this coupon code.

31:16.660 --> 31:18.500
Now, of course, they don't attach names or anything,

31:18.500 --> 31:21.220
so we don't know which one of you is the friend.

31:22.340 --> 31:24.900
I also want to say, this comes straight from James.

31:24.900 --> 31:26.820
This is market research, people.

31:26.820 --> 31:28.420
My brother, my brother and me

31:28.420 --> 31:32.420
has the sexiest, most adventurous listeners of anyone out there ever.

31:34.660 --> 31:37.300
This is my life's fucking greatest accomplishment.

31:37.940 --> 31:40.980
That we have created something

31:41.860 --> 31:46.340
that is like a burning flame to all these fucking sex models.

31:46.340 --> 31:46.900
I love it.

31:48.660 --> 31:50.740
I think my favorite item on this list,

31:51.380 --> 31:53.300
only because of the word choices,

31:53.300 --> 31:56.980
is silicone derriere plug.

31:56.980 --> 31:58.500
Oh my, how dignified.

31:58.500 --> 31:59.060
I know.

31:59.700 --> 32:03.780
That's also with a tea set, which is weird.

32:04.740 --> 32:08.660
Oh, Daryl, Daryl, would you be a deer

32:08.660 --> 32:10.820
and insert that plug into my derriere?

32:11.780 --> 32:14.020
The one sitting on the doily, yes.

32:14.020 --> 32:15.460
It's the one on the doily,

32:15.460 --> 32:19.700
protecting the table from my natural oil.

32:19.700 --> 32:24.500
If it won't fit, feel free to use some of my wig powder

32:28.260 --> 32:30.740
to reduce the friction, Jeremy.

32:35.780 --> 32:38.900
I also see on here that somebody bought a joint purse dress

32:38.900 --> 32:42.020
of a male masturbation device and a strap-on.

32:42.020 --> 32:44.340
They're not planning on doing anything

32:44.340 --> 32:47.540
except putting the strap-on into the masturbation device.

32:47.540 --> 32:50.580
I mean, that would seem like the obvious option here.

32:51.220 --> 32:52.820
Maybe they'll be out of town for a while

32:52.820 --> 32:55.300
and they want robbers to think someone's in there fucking.

32:55.300 --> 32:59.140
Right, the flashlight is just a holster for the strap-on.

32:59.940 --> 33:02.660
Like a sheath, a scabbard, if you will.

33:04.260 --> 33:07.700
There's also a set of stainless steel kegel balls

33:07.700 --> 33:09.060
purchased by itself,

33:09.060 --> 33:11.540
and I want to say to whatever lady purchased that,

33:11.540 --> 33:12.180
good for you.

33:12.900 --> 33:13.540
Good for you.

33:13.540 --> 33:15.140
You may not even have a man right now,

33:15.140 --> 33:17.060
but when you do, you gonna be ready.

33:17.060 --> 33:17.380
And?

33:17.380 --> 33:20.020
You're gonna be ready to tear him apart.

33:20.020 --> 33:20.820
And not only that,

33:21.460 --> 33:24.820
but when you're not enjoying them in the traditional way,

33:25.460 --> 33:27.300
you can take a couple fushigi lessons.

33:28.100 --> 33:28.500
Perfect.

33:29.300 --> 33:30.020
Perfecto.

33:30.020 --> 33:30.660
Perfectamundo.

33:30.660 --> 33:31.220
Perfecto.

33:32.260 --> 33:33.860
So go to ExtremeRestraints.com,

33:33.860 --> 33:36.020
use the coupon code Sexabunga, save yourself 20%,

33:36.980 --> 33:40.580
and maybe you'll be sort of secondhand famous.

33:40.580 --> 33:41.460
Who knows?

33:41.460 --> 33:42.420
It's impossible to say.

33:43.540 --> 33:46.820
But don't, you know, don't worry.

33:46.820 --> 33:48.580
We're never gonna blow up your spot.

33:48.580 --> 33:50.020
It's your secret, but you know what?

33:50.020 --> 33:51.460
It shouldn't even be a secret.

33:51.460 --> 33:53.540
Everybody just try something new.

33:54.260 --> 33:54.900
You're worth it.

33:54.900 --> 33:55.540
You've earned it.

33:55.540 --> 33:56.580
Spice it up in there.

33:56.580 --> 33:57.540
Easy, pretty, beautiful.

33:59.140 --> 34:00.100
Hi, this is Biz.

34:00.100 --> 34:01.060
And I'm Teresa.

34:01.060 --> 34:03.700
And we host a show about being new moms.

34:03.700 --> 34:05.620
Have you ever pretended to be a sleeping rock

34:05.620 --> 34:07.860
to make your three-year-old play by yourself?

34:07.860 --> 34:09.940
How about scream singing to make yourself think

34:09.940 --> 34:11.300
you aren't screaming?

34:11.300 --> 34:14.740
You're singing really, really loud!

34:30.340 --> 34:31.060
Please.

34:31.060 --> 34:32.900
This Yahoo was sent in by Wayne Rowan.

34:32.900 --> 34:33.460
Thank you, Wayne.

34:34.180 --> 34:36.500
It's by Yahoo Answers user Sophie who asks,

34:39.380 --> 34:42.100
do horses have any emotions that humans don't have?

34:42.100 --> 34:44.900
I am actually doing a horse behavior presentation

34:44.900 --> 34:46.420
for an equine class I'm in.

34:47.220 --> 34:50.340
But I was wondering if horses had exactly the same emotions

34:50.340 --> 34:51.700
that we humans do.

34:52.260 --> 34:54.180
Humans as in parentheses, as if like,

34:54.900 --> 34:56.340
you didn't fucking know.

34:56.340 --> 34:59.220
As we humans do.

34:59.220 --> 35:02.020
I went on a website that told me the types of behavior

35:02.020 --> 35:02.900
that horses have.

35:03.620 --> 35:04.820
Buckle your asses in.

35:06.820 --> 35:08.420
Can I make one quick point before you tell me

35:08.420 --> 35:11.220
that horses have any emotions that humans don't have?

35:11.220 --> 35:12.740
Quick point before you tell me the behavior,

35:12.740 --> 35:13.700
the things that horses have.

35:14.740 --> 35:17.540
I want to see if you did get something valuable from this

35:17.540 --> 35:18.900
before your presentation.

35:18.900 --> 35:21.460
I definitely, definitely can't wait to see

35:21.460 --> 35:23.460
this line on the bibliography.

35:23.460 --> 35:26.820
I can't wait to see how you cite the information

35:26.820 --> 35:28.180
you received from Yahoo Answers.

35:30.020 --> 35:30.740
Acceptance.

35:36.180 --> 35:36.900
That's fair.

35:36.900 --> 35:38.980
If you're professionally being ridden,

35:38.980 --> 35:44.500
it's not ideal, but I don't have a noticeable bum, so.

35:44.500 --> 35:45.700
I love oats and apples.

35:48.020 --> 35:49.220
Affection, sure.

35:50.420 --> 35:51.780
This is my favorite.

35:51.780 --> 35:53.860
Anger one and anger two.

35:56.340 --> 35:59.620
Anger one is like a quiet, reserved anger,

35:59.620 --> 36:02.340
and anger two is like an explosion of biting.

36:02.980 --> 36:04.020
It's just spurs.

36:04.020 --> 36:05.460
That's the only thing that the,

36:05.460 --> 36:06.660
if they see spurs like, ah.

36:06.660 --> 36:08.020
Ah, no.

36:08.020 --> 36:09.380
I am angry one.

36:09.380 --> 36:10.820
Breaking out the dose today.

36:12.260 --> 36:12.900
Annoyance.

36:14.980 --> 36:15.780
Who doesn't?

36:15.780 --> 36:16.340
Apathy.

36:17.620 --> 36:18.660
Well, fine.

36:18.660 --> 36:18.980
Oats.

36:18.980 --> 36:20.180
I accepted too much.

36:20.180 --> 36:21.380
Oats, I guess.

36:21.380 --> 36:22.820
Another ride, ugh.

36:22.820 --> 36:23.300
Yeah, sure.

36:23.300 --> 36:23.700
Perfect.

36:23.700 --> 36:24.500
Whatever.

36:24.500 --> 36:26.500
Jumps, tricks, it's all the same.

36:27.860 --> 36:29.700
Beautifully soaring through nature

36:29.700 --> 36:31.940
like an earthbound dragon, sure, why not?

36:32.980 --> 36:33.780
Anxiety.

36:33.780 --> 36:38.180
What if I run out of oats?

36:38.180 --> 36:38.740
Could happen.

36:42.180 --> 36:42.660
Boredom.

36:44.580 --> 36:45.380
Well, what?

36:45.380 --> 36:48.420
Okay, I can't blame them too much for that.

36:48.420 --> 36:50.660
Right, it's like they can't even watch Game of Thrones.

36:50.660 --> 36:51.300
Like, what?

36:51.300 --> 36:52.180
Like, they don't get HBO.

36:52.180 --> 36:54.340
Could you turn the TV towards the window, please?

36:54.340 --> 36:54.660
Right.

36:54.660 --> 36:56.180
Towards the window.

36:56.180 --> 36:57.380
I got a big day today.

36:57.380 --> 37:00.260
I'm either gonna stand in grass or run in a loop.

37:00.260 --> 37:03.860
I can't wait to see what fate has in store.

37:03.860 --> 37:05.060
Well, I mean, that's okay.

37:05.060 --> 37:06.020
Tame horses, yes.

37:06.020 --> 37:07.700
I could see them falling prey to boredom.

37:07.700 --> 37:09.700
Wild horses, are you fucking kidding me?

37:10.500 --> 37:11.700
Are you fucking kidding me?

37:12.900 --> 37:15.220
Boredom for a wild horse, it can't happen.

37:15.220 --> 37:17.220
Wild horses aren't familiar with this emotion

37:17.220 --> 37:19.140
because they can just go jump over a brook

37:19.140 --> 37:20.580
they've never jumped over before.

37:22.180 --> 37:24.260
I have to imagine that for a wild horse,

37:24.260 --> 37:26.740
it's mainly about anxiety because they're very fast

37:26.740 --> 37:30.020
and I can see a situation where you're in a conversation

37:30.020 --> 37:31.700
deep with another horse friend

37:31.700 --> 37:33.700
and then all of a sudden you look at them and you think,

37:33.700 --> 37:39.860
hey, Rodrigo, have you seen any grass for a while?

37:39.860 --> 37:42.180
And then Rodrigo's like, oh my God, you're right.

37:42.180 --> 37:42.980
There's no grass.

37:42.980 --> 37:44.740
And they're in the middle of a parking lot.

37:44.740 --> 37:45.860
They're in a parking lot.

37:45.860 --> 37:46.500
Oh, great.

37:46.500 --> 37:47.460
This is gonna be on the news.

37:47.460 --> 37:48.660
Was no one paying attention?

37:49.780 --> 37:51.220
Who was following who?

37:51.220 --> 37:52.740
I'm feeling annoyance right now,

37:52.740 --> 37:54.660
which could be upgraded to anger one

37:54.660 --> 37:55.700
if something doesn't change.

37:55.700 --> 37:57.700
If you keep running your fucking mouth, Rodrigo,

37:57.700 --> 37:59.140
it's gonna get upgraded to anger two

37:59.140 --> 38:00.100
and you don't want to see that.

38:00.100 --> 38:02.180
So maybe just relax while we figure this out.

38:02.180 --> 38:02.820
Compassion.

38:04.420 --> 38:05.380
It's got a fat rider.

38:06.260 --> 38:06.900
It's too bad.

38:07.700 --> 38:08.420
You see Lucy?

38:08.420 --> 38:09.780
Lucy's got a fat rider.

38:09.780 --> 38:10.180
I know.

38:11.620 --> 38:12.180
Poor thing.

38:12.180 --> 38:16.100
If you are a being that is mainly bred to be ridden

38:16.820 --> 38:20.260
and you can still work up compassion for anything else,

38:20.260 --> 38:21.620
like, God bless you.

38:21.620 --> 38:24.820
That is a beautiful, beautiful reserve of goodwill.

38:24.820 --> 38:26.660
Well, they feel bad for the burros.

38:26.660 --> 38:28.340
For the burros.

38:28.340 --> 38:28.840
Sure.

38:30.340 --> 38:31.380
Sure, they do.

38:31.380 --> 38:32.180
For the burros.

38:32.740 --> 38:33.060
Yeah.

38:33.060 --> 38:35.460
No, roll the R's because it's not authentic if you don't.

38:35.460 --> 38:35.860
Thank you.

38:37.220 --> 38:38.740
I don't know what animal you're talking about

38:38.740 --> 38:39.860
if you don't roll the R.

38:39.860 --> 38:41.060
Uh, contentment.

38:41.940 --> 38:43.620
Very few horses, I imagine, feel this.

38:45.060 --> 38:48.100
Orb definitely feel, orb appreciates the fact

38:48.100 --> 38:50.980
that he has reached the physical fucking apex

38:50.980 --> 38:53.140
of possibly any creature on the planet.

38:54.420 --> 38:55.780
That's just anxiety, right?

38:55.780 --> 38:58.260
And even if you win the Kentucky Derby,

38:58.260 --> 38:59.780
it's like, well, am I going to get the triple crown?

38:59.780 --> 39:01.380
That's what everybody starts asking.

39:01.380 --> 39:02.500
That's a lot of pressure.

39:02.500 --> 39:03.940
Am I going to be able to fucking keep up

39:03.940 --> 39:05.780
this perfect body until the preakness?

39:06.660 --> 39:08.820
They're going to shower me in oats after this fucking thing.

39:08.820 --> 39:11.300
What if I can't perform my stud duties?

39:11.300 --> 39:11.780
Right.

39:11.780 --> 39:12.500
Oh, man.

39:13.860 --> 39:14.500
I bet orb-

39:14.500 --> 39:15.140
That's rough.

39:15.140 --> 39:17.940
I bet orb fucks like a cylinder.

39:17.940 --> 39:18.740
Like a stallion.

39:20.100 --> 39:21.780
There's a whole saying where someone says

39:21.780 --> 39:22.980
they're hung like a U.

39:22.980 --> 39:25.460
Yeah, that's a lot of pressure.

39:26.260 --> 39:27.060
Curiosity?

39:28.660 --> 39:29.160
Doubtful.

39:29.780 --> 39:30.980
Based on what?

39:30.980 --> 39:32.020
Why is that doubtful?

39:33.620 --> 39:34.980
Like, what are they curious about?

39:34.980 --> 39:35.860
They have everything they need.

39:36.500 --> 39:38.260
I wonder what driving a car is like.

39:39.220 --> 39:39.540
Right.

39:40.340 --> 39:42.420
If they are curious about it, I refuse to-

39:42.420 --> 39:43.620
If they're curious about anything,

39:44.340 --> 39:45.220
like, they're not-

39:45.220 --> 39:46.660
They're certainly not acting on it

39:46.660 --> 39:48.980
because they seem to be kind of in a rut as a species.

39:48.980 --> 39:51.300
Yeah, nobody's ever said curiosity killed the horse

39:51.300 --> 39:53.860
because a horse will see like-

39:53.860 --> 39:55.860
A fucking helicopter could land next to a horse

39:55.860 --> 39:56.660
and a horse would be like,

39:56.660 --> 39:57.460
that's not an apple.

39:59.300 --> 40:00.180
Is that an apple?

40:00.180 --> 40:02.020
You check for a stem.

40:02.020 --> 40:02.900
Nope, no stem.

40:02.900 --> 40:03.380
No, thanks.

40:03.380 --> 40:04.260
Come back when you're hay.

40:07.700 --> 40:08.200
Fear?

40:08.740 --> 40:09.300
Sure.

40:09.300 --> 40:09.800
Yeah.

40:10.340 --> 40:11.220
Yeah, daily.

40:11.220 --> 40:12.020
If there's a bull-

40:12.020 --> 40:13.380
If there's a bull snake around,

40:13.380 --> 40:14.740
those things are terrified.

40:14.740 --> 40:15.380
Loneliness?

40:15.380 --> 40:16.980
Not if I have anything to say about it.

40:18.900 --> 40:20.100
Physical suffering.

40:20.100 --> 40:21.060
Yes, sure.

40:21.060 --> 40:22.180
Definitely, 100%.

40:22.180 --> 40:22.680
Absolutely.

40:24.020 --> 40:26.340
Their entire being is suspended

40:26.340 --> 40:28.420
in a state of constant suffering.

40:28.420 --> 40:29.060
So, yes.

40:30.180 --> 40:31.380
Think about how sad-

40:31.380 --> 40:33.060
When horses get the spurs

40:33.060 --> 40:34.420
and then they run faster,

40:34.420 --> 40:36.660
they're trying to run away from a danger

40:36.660 --> 40:38.820
that is like physically attached to them.

40:38.820 --> 40:39.300
Right.

40:39.300 --> 40:41.140
That's the saddest thing in the world.

40:41.140 --> 40:42.180
Which most humans have,

40:42.180 --> 40:44.660
but do horses have any emotions that humans don't have

40:44.660 --> 40:46.260
or that humans can't relate to?

40:46.260 --> 40:46.660
Thanks.

40:47.220 --> 40:47.460
Prance?

40:47.460 --> 40:48.180
A ladder?

40:48.180 --> 40:48.660
Yes.

40:48.660 --> 40:49.140
What?

40:49.140 --> 40:49.700
Prancing?

40:49.700 --> 40:50.900
Prancing is my-

40:50.900 --> 40:51.400
Okay.

40:52.420 --> 40:52.820
Yeah.

40:52.820 --> 40:54.500
I've never felt prancing.

40:54.500 --> 40:55.780
I don't think that's beyond human-

40:56.340 --> 40:58.180
It's beyond you, yes.

40:58.180 --> 41:00.740
Just because of like your physique.

41:00.740 --> 41:01.140
No offense.

41:01.140 --> 41:02.180
Wouldn't you think, though,

41:02.180 --> 41:04.420
that if the horses did have an emotion

41:04.420 --> 41:07.540
that we don't have in humankind,

41:07.540 --> 41:10.420
then we probably don't have a human word for it, right?

41:10.420 --> 41:10.740
Right.

41:10.740 --> 41:11.460
It's sort of like-

41:12.100 --> 41:14.580
It's kind of like the flavor umami.

41:15.700 --> 41:16.260
Sure.

41:16.260 --> 41:19.060
It's an indescribable thing.

41:19.060 --> 41:21.620
It's like if there were any new colors that we didn't know,

41:21.620 --> 41:24.020
we would know about it.

41:24.020 --> 41:24.740
You know what I mean?

41:25.940 --> 41:28.660
Are there any suggestions from Yahoo answerers

41:29.300 --> 41:31.780
as to some emotions that horses might feel

41:31.780 --> 41:33.220
that we might not be able to detect?

41:33.220 --> 41:36.580
Yahoo answers user MsEquine responded and said,

41:36.580 --> 41:37.540
all that you listed-

41:38.900 --> 41:39.460
Wait, hold on.

41:40.100 --> 41:42.340
I don't know if they're saying that her list was comprehensive

41:42.340 --> 41:45.620
or that MsEquine is incapable of feeling acceptance,

41:45.620 --> 41:48.340
affection, anger 1, anger 2, annoyance, apathy, anxiety,

41:48.340 --> 41:50.340
boredom, compassion, consent, and curiosity,

41:50.340 --> 41:52.020
fear, loneliness, and physical suffering.

41:52.020 --> 41:53.060
First I've heard of it.

41:53.060 --> 41:53.860
What is this stuff?

41:53.860 --> 41:54.500
Compassion.

41:55.780 --> 41:56.260
Go on.

41:58.580 --> 41:59.620
Oh, MsEquine.

42:00.740 --> 42:02.980
Yahoo answers user Zakit says,

42:02.980 --> 42:05.140
I do not believe they have compassion.

42:07.060 --> 42:09.540
I've seen some horses do some cold ass shit.

42:12.500 --> 42:13.700
If anything happens to another horse,

42:13.700 --> 42:15.220
the horse is unlikely to help out.

42:15.220 --> 42:16.500
He might just continue to graze

42:16.500 --> 42:18.340
or to watch with mild interest.

42:18.340 --> 42:20.740
What do you want the horse to do?

42:20.740 --> 42:22.020
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

42:22.020 --> 42:23.540
Fucking cut it out, man.

42:23.540 --> 42:26.100
To be fair, it says compassion.

42:26.100 --> 42:27.620
That doesn't necessarily mean that

42:27.620 --> 42:29.220
they're going to do anything about it.

42:30.020 --> 42:31.700
They could just feel real bad about it

42:31.700 --> 42:32.660
and be like, well, what am I going to do?

42:32.660 --> 42:33.380
I don't have thumbs.

42:34.740 --> 42:36.100
Just got these hooves.

42:36.100 --> 42:39.940
If you have a hoof related debacle for me to fix, maybe.

42:39.940 --> 42:41.540
Am I supposed to pull a rock out of your shoe?

42:41.540 --> 42:42.740
What am I supposed to do?

42:42.740 --> 42:43.300
I'm a horse.

42:44.100 --> 42:45.300
I'll give you some hay.

42:45.300 --> 42:47.300
No, I need it.

42:48.660 --> 42:51.460
Yahoo answers user blackcatmagic says,

42:52.180 --> 42:53.380
I think it's foolish to think that

42:53.380 --> 42:54.980
we know exactly what horses feel.

42:56.900 --> 42:58.500
Maybe they do feel all the things that we do,

42:58.500 --> 42:59.780
but have different ways of showing it

42:59.780 --> 43:01.700
that we can't begin to understand.

43:01.700 --> 43:03.220
Maybe they don't show certain emotions at all,

43:03.220 --> 43:04.740
but that doesn't mean they aren't feeling.

43:05.300 --> 43:06.500
Until horses learn to talk,

43:06.500 --> 43:07.860
we'll never know, smiley face.

43:08.740 --> 43:09.220
Until.

43:09.220 --> 43:10.420
Yeah, I like the conditional.

43:10.420 --> 43:10.900
Until.

43:10.900 --> 43:12.900
The conditional in that statement is wonderful.

43:13.540 --> 43:14.100
Until.

43:14.100 --> 43:14.740
Until.

43:14.740 --> 43:15.300
For now.

43:16.820 --> 43:19.540
Much like man used to stare into the skies and wonder.

43:20.260 --> 43:23.860
By 2017, think how foolish this question will appear.

43:23.860 --> 43:24.580
God.

43:24.580 --> 43:26.020
Horsebizgirl says,

43:30.660 --> 43:32.900
horses don't feel guilty about things.

43:34.580 --> 43:35.780
Humans feel regret.

43:35.780 --> 43:36.500
Horses don't.

43:39.220 --> 43:42.660
Horses lost a big race.

43:42.660 --> 43:44.180
Oh well, oats.

43:47.700 --> 43:48.980
Trampled that kid.

43:48.980 --> 43:49.700
Oats.

43:50.820 --> 43:51.620
I have a question.

43:51.620 --> 43:54.100
If horses don't feel bad about anything in their past,

43:54.100 --> 43:55.060
why are they running?

43:56.500 --> 43:57.300
Think about it.

43:58.340 --> 43:59.700
Are they running to something?

43:59.700 --> 44:01.060
No, they're running away.

44:01.060 --> 44:02.580
I want to know if a horse can feel shame.

44:03.220 --> 44:03.860
What would a horse-

44:03.860 --> 44:06.020
Plenty of opportunities to feel that, if so.

44:06.020 --> 44:08.020
What could a horse possibly be ashamed of?

44:08.020 --> 44:10.100
Like, hey, you just pooped in the middle of the street.

44:10.980 --> 44:11.700
I guess.

44:11.700 --> 44:13.380
You're dragging a cart for a living.

44:13.380 --> 44:14.100
You're majestic.

44:14.100 --> 44:14.900
What are you doing?

44:14.900 --> 44:16.180
I know I'm ashamed.

44:16.180 --> 44:20.420
There's an emotion that I've never felt that I bet horses could feel.

44:20.420 --> 44:24.740
Like, there might be some based on their understanding of the world.

44:24.740 --> 44:26.740
Like, there might be a feeling of,

44:27.380 --> 44:30.740
can someone please learn how to cook oats?

44:30.740 --> 44:33.460
There has to be a way to cook oats.

44:33.460 --> 44:35.060
I would never have that emotion.

44:35.700 --> 44:38.420
And that's why I don't have an English way of translating it,

44:38.420 --> 44:41.860
but I bet that feeling is kind of a present part of their day.

44:41.860 --> 44:42.340
They think-

44:42.340 --> 44:46.020
You're saying that they are constantly disappointed in oats.

44:47.060 --> 44:47.300
Right.

44:48.420 --> 44:49.780
Oats because we keep giving them,

44:49.780 --> 44:52.020
but they can't express a preference for one or the other.

44:52.020 --> 44:53.140
Maybe they're sitting there like,

44:53.140 --> 44:55.300
can I please just have like a hamburger or something?

44:55.940 --> 44:57.060
See you doing it.

44:57.060 --> 44:57.860
Is there-

44:57.860 --> 45:00.660
Do you think horses feel disappointment in us?

45:00.660 --> 45:02.420
In humanity?

45:02.420 --> 45:02.920
Yeah.

45:03.620 --> 45:04.740
I should hope so.

45:04.740 --> 45:07.460
I mean, we've not been great custodians at this time.

45:07.460 --> 45:08.500
No.

45:08.500 --> 45:12.260
In fact, I think they're kind of getting the shitty end of this deal.

45:12.260 --> 45:13.860
The deal we struck up between us and-

45:13.860 --> 45:19.540
We looked at horses gallivanting across the plains of the American West and thought,

45:19.540 --> 45:20.500
I'm gonna sit on that.

45:20.500 --> 45:21.700
Hey, do that for me now.

45:23.300 --> 45:24.100
I could break that.

45:24.660 --> 45:26.580
I'm gonna sit on that forever.

45:26.580 --> 45:27.380
You could-

45:27.380 --> 45:27.780
I'll tell you-

45:27.780 --> 45:29.940
Even after I develop an automobile,

45:29.940 --> 45:32.980
which is by all means much more efficient than my stool,

45:32.980 --> 45:36.100
I'm still going to keep horses and sit on them.

45:36.100 --> 45:38.660
I'm saying-

45:38.660 --> 45:42.580
There may be an emotion for knowing that you're the first horse

45:42.580 --> 45:44.180
to ever let someone sit on them.

45:44.180 --> 45:48.420
And now your children's children's children's children's children

45:48.420 --> 45:51.140
are gonna have a human being strapped to their back.

45:52.420 --> 45:54.420
The first horse that got caught.

45:54.420 --> 45:55.780
What is that feeling like?

45:55.780 --> 45:56.420
You have to carry-

45:56.420 --> 45:57.300
I don't have a word for that.

45:57.300 --> 45:58.660
Well, let's just try this out.

45:58.660 --> 46:01.780
Let's just try this out for a bit and see if we both like it.

46:02.420 --> 46:05.620
Surely human beings will recognize how inefficient this is.

46:05.620 --> 46:05.780
Right.

46:05.780 --> 46:07.140
Surely they'll invent cars.

46:07.940 --> 46:12.260
Don't you have to think there was a horse very near to the Ford plant

46:12.260 --> 46:14.980
and like the first Model T comes out and they're like,

46:14.980 --> 46:15.300
whew!

46:15.300 --> 46:17.060
All right, guys, great news.

46:17.060 --> 46:18.660
I just saw the most wondrous sight.

46:19.380 --> 46:20.420
We're gonna be free now.

46:20.420 --> 46:21.940
We're gonna be a-okay.

46:21.940 --> 46:24.500
I hope they make these cars big enough for us horses to drive.

46:26.500 --> 46:30.020
And even if not, at least we'll be able to run free again.

46:30.020 --> 46:30.500
I hope-

46:30.500 --> 46:34.180
I hope they give us a nice, some like a big area that's just for us.

46:34.180 --> 46:38.580
A whole state just for horses as a nice way of saying we're sorry

46:38.580 --> 46:40.580
for sitting on you for eternity.

46:43.620 --> 46:44.900
Guys, I can't feel anger too.

46:48.900 --> 46:49.620
I just don't-

46:49.620 --> 46:50.260
I don't-

46:50.260 --> 46:50.980
Let me sit up.

46:50.980 --> 46:53.700
Let me sit on you and sit on everyone you've ever met.

46:53.700 --> 46:54.420
That would fucking do it.

46:54.420 --> 46:56.180
We'll see if you can't work it up.

46:56.180 --> 46:56.420
Yeah.

46:56.980 --> 47:00.660
Coming this summer, the sequel to everyone's favorite emotion.

47:00.660 --> 47:04.260
I have an office job, and a new employee was recently hired on.

47:04.260 --> 47:07.460
He seems like a nice normal guy, except for this one thing.

47:07.460 --> 47:09.780
He keeps winking at everybody all the time.

47:09.780 --> 47:10.260
Oh, man.

47:10.260 --> 47:13.380
In almost every conversation he has, usually when he's making a joke

47:13.380 --> 47:16.420
or saying something that could be considered amusing, he winks.

47:16.420 --> 47:19.460
It's making me and my other co-workers a bit uncomfortable.

47:19.460 --> 47:21.860
What should we do about this wacky winker?

47:21.860 --> 47:22.740
Winked at.

47:22.740 --> 47:28.900
Do you know what would make this already hilarious situation even funnier?

47:28.900 --> 47:30.820
I can't stop thinking about it.

47:30.820 --> 47:32.420
It's giving me a Google fit.

47:32.420 --> 47:38.980
What if every time this dude winked, his eyeball made like an audible squishing sound?

47:38.980 --> 47:44.660
Like, just like that, every time he winked.

47:44.660 --> 47:45.780
You know what I'm talking about.

47:45.780 --> 47:50.580
Someone just threw up in their mouth.

47:50.580 --> 47:51.140
Sorry, everybody.

47:51.140 --> 47:51.620
Sorry.

47:52.900 --> 47:58.660
This person is the most confident person that I've ever met.

47:58.660 --> 47:59.460
That has ever lived.

48:00.340 --> 48:04.980
This person is a beautiful soaring eagle, and I don't want you to do anything to change him.

48:04.980 --> 48:08.740
I do not know that I have ever unironically winked at someone ever.

48:08.740 --> 48:10.980
When was the last time you winked at anybody?

48:10.980 --> 48:16.420
I mean, sometimes I'll do it as a joke and actually say the word wink when I do it.

48:17.140 --> 48:20.820
But I've never been like, I'm going to convey a secret message or confidence

48:20.820 --> 48:22.740
via a closing of my eyeball.

48:22.740 --> 48:29.060
Right, you've never hatched a plan in an impromptu nature, unspokenly.

48:29.060 --> 48:34.980
Now, I'll lay my finger to the side of my nose and kind of do like a flick, you know, kind of thing.

48:34.980 --> 48:37.620
Right, but then you think people are asking you to do cocaine.

48:37.620 --> 48:40.500
Okay, that does explain a lot, actually.

48:40.500 --> 48:45.380
If you think about it, a wink is pretty much the boldest gesture you can give.

48:45.380 --> 48:49.620
It's really like setting a wild animal free.

48:49.620 --> 48:52.500
You have so little control over how that is perceived.

48:52.500 --> 48:52.900
Right.

48:52.900 --> 48:53.540
By people.

48:54.500 --> 48:55.460
I don't think I've ever...

48:56.100 --> 48:59.620
If I have winked at someone, I don't think I've ever done it without worrying like,

48:59.620 --> 49:01.300
did they think that was sexual?

49:01.300 --> 49:03.060
Did they think that I was lying?

49:03.060 --> 49:06.100
Did they think that I was having a seizure?

49:06.660 --> 49:07.700
Could you do it?

49:07.700 --> 49:12.180
Okay, this is completely off topic, but do you think that you could wink in like a threatening way?

49:12.180 --> 49:15.700
Or like just in like a wink that conveys nothing?

49:17.060 --> 49:18.260
Just like a neutral wink?

49:18.260 --> 49:21.860
I think if I'm in the ring, if I'm in the boxing ring,

49:21.860 --> 49:26.500
I'm a professional boxer and I'm about to go up against Mayweather.

49:28.900 --> 49:32.180
If I'm going up against the Santa Maria and the Pinta,

49:32.180 --> 49:35.540
if I'm about to fucking lay into some dude with punches

49:36.180 --> 49:41.380
and right before I get to him in the ring, he winks at me, I'm done.

49:42.500 --> 49:43.540
TKO right there.

49:43.540 --> 49:44.820
I don't know what the fuck...

49:44.820 --> 49:48.740
Yeah, I think you can get in an opponent's head in that manner,

49:48.740 --> 49:51.540
in a manner that could be described as threatening.

49:51.540 --> 49:53.060
You have to partner, I think...

49:53.060 --> 49:57.300
I think if you were in the ring with somebody right before the punching was to commence,

49:57.300 --> 49:58.580
you looked at them and said,

49:58.580 --> 50:00.500
hey, I'm not going to punch him.

50:00.500 --> 50:01.380
Wink.

50:01.380 --> 50:01.880
Wink?

50:03.140 --> 50:04.660
Because then it's like, does he mean it?

50:04.660 --> 50:05.460
What does that mean?

50:05.460 --> 50:06.660
Should I not punch him?

50:06.660 --> 50:08.100
Is this an agreement?

50:08.100 --> 50:09.780
I was expecting him to punch me,

50:09.780 --> 50:13.460
so I don't know why he would be letting on that the punching was going to commence.

50:13.460 --> 50:15.220
Are we just going to use our words?

50:15.220 --> 50:17.300
And you would have thought that far before it's like,

50:17.300 --> 50:22.820
haymaker on the mat, one, two, three, four, I'm just going to skip him because you're clearly done.

50:22.820 --> 50:23.320
Ten.

50:23.940 --> 50:28.340
What would you do if you paid big money to get front row seats for a boxing match in Vegas,

50:28.340 --> 50:34.180
and then you got there and then within seconds you realize that they've just turned it into forensics?

50:35.220 --> 50:37.700
They're just getting up there and they're going to do monologues.

50:37.700 --> 50:39.220
With the wink heard around the world.

50:39.220 --> 50:39.720
Right.

50:39.720 --> 50:47.480
Um, I have never received a wink from a stranger and not like felt it,

50:47.480 --> 50:50.600
like physically like it like pushed me back a little bit.

50:51.320 --> 50:54.520
How would you define the physical conduct that you felt from the wink?

50:54.520 --> 50:56.520
Like a smack in the face or like a poke?

50:56.520 --> 50:59.000
It takes my breath away every time.

50:59.000 --> 50:59.500
Wow.

51:00.920 --> 51:02.680
Just because like the power move?

51:02.680 --> 51:05.480
It's just startling because like both of their eyes were open.

51:06.040 --> 51:06.920
You know what I mean?

51:06.920 --> 51:07.800
And they didn't blink.

51:07.800 --> 51:12.600
I would have been fine if both of them had gone down, but I just saw one of them.

51:14.360 --> 51:16.680
And they're going to be off sync for the rest of the day.

51:16.680 --> 51:18.680
You're going to have to be individually winking.

51:18.680 --> 51:20.840
Also, do they want to see my like genital?

51:20.840 --> 51:22.920
Like what, what does it mean?

51:23.880 --> 51:24.840
What are they trying to get across?

51:24.840 --> 51:26.280
What are they trying to tell me?

51:26.280 --> 51:29.160
That, that is what throws people about winks, I think.

51:29.160 --> 51:30.200
Because you...

51:31.480 --> 51:34.600
Can we take back, can we take back the wink so that it's not,

51:34.600 --> 51:39.080
it's not seen as a seductive measure as much as it is like a high five.

51:39.080 --> 51:41.080
Like a, hey, we're all in this together.

51:41.880 --> 51:42.380
You know?

51:44.440 --> 51:46.440
If someone says we're all in this together and then they wink at you,

51:46.440 --> 51:47.560
do they mean that you're not?

51:48.840 --> 51:49.400
Oh, okay.

51:49.400 --> 51:51.480
Is it a subterfuge like double back thing?

51:52.040 --> 51:54.040
I always think a wink means you're lying.

51:54.040 --> 51:57.400
Like that to me is what that like, oh, we'll see if we can go.

51:57.400 --> 52:01.240
That only works if you're facing some kind of like international terrorist

52:01.240 --> 52:03.400
and he's got a gun on you and you look at your partner and go,

52:03.400 --> 52:07.080
oh, I guess, you know, we have to give up wink.

52:07.080 --> 52:10.040
I don't think it works if you're like, you did a really good job on this project.

52:10.040 --> 52:11.400
Right, but then the terrorists will be like,

52:12.040 --> 52:14.920
is this guy trying to, is this guy trying to bone down?

52:14.920 --> 52:15.420
Like...

52:16.280 --> 52:18.440
I'm trying to think back to the times that I've been winked at.

52:18.440 --> 52:21.560
And in retrospect, I'm pretty sure I've never been winked at

52:21.560 --> 52:24.280
and I haven't made a face like I just smelled rotten yogurt.

52:24.920 --> 52:28.680
It's, it, I think it would be like, oh, okay, fine.

52:28.680 --> 52:29.960
Wink at me, I guess.

52:29.960 --> 52:37.960
If a grandpa does it to me, then it reads as like a symbol of familiarity.

52:39.480 --> 52:42.600
Maybe even feigned familiarity, but I don't read it like

52:42.600 --> 52:45.720
this grandpa's trying to get in my jorts, you know?

52:45.720 --> 52:47.240
You're saying it's grandpa safe.

52:47.240 --> 52:48.920
It's grandpa safe. Grandpas can do it.

52:48.920 --> 52:53.800
If a person who has been hired on is winking and is also a grandpa,

52:53.800 --> 52:55.720
then everything I just said is okay.

52:56.760 --> 52:58.440
Okay, what if this, what if it's...

52:58.440 --> 52:59.800
Or a grandma.

52:59.800 --> 53:03.080
What if it's used as a means to convey approval

53:03.080 --> 53:04.120
that you don't want to say out loud?

53:04.120 --> 53:06.200
Like you're talking to someone at a party

53:06.200 --> 53:08.040
and your friend from across the room is,

53:08.040 --> 53:11.400
doesn't want to do like a thumbs up because that's too, that's too much.

53:11.400 --> 53:13.880
But you're saying like, oh, you guys seem to really be hitting it off.

53:13.880 --> 53:15.240
You can convey that with a wink, right?

53:15.240 --> 53:15.640
Where you're like...

53:15.640 --> 53:18.440
If I'm at a party and someone from across the room winks at me,

53:18.440 --> 53:20.200
I'm going to assume they put a bomb in there.

53:20.200 --> 53:21.800
I'm going to assume there's a bomb in the building.

53:21.800 --> 53:24.360
But if it's like your best bud, if it's like your best bud

53:24.360 --> 53:27.560
and kind of does like a half nod, like wink, like you're doing it.

53:27.560 --> 53:30.280
If it's a good party, Davey, and then he winks at me,

53:30.280 --> 53:32.440
I'm like, oh God, you're going to kill everybody in here, aren't you?

53:32.440 --> 53:33.960
Fuck, this is a party.

53:33.960 --> 53:37.000
You will reflexively just mouth back to him.

53:37.000 --> 53:37.640
Upstairs.

53:39.320 --> 53:39.880
Upstairs.

53:42.760 --> 53:43.720
Why are you doing this to me?

53:45.400 --> 53:47.960
What if every time he winked at you, you winked right back?

53:48.760 --> 53:49.160
Twice.

53:49.880 --> 53:50.440
Twice.

53:50.440 --> 53:51.640
Let him know what it's like.

53:51.640 --> 53:54.520
Cause I think this guy maybe doesn't have a world view

53:54.520 --> 53:56.120
where people have winked at him a lot.

53:56.120 --> 53:58.920
So if you wink at this guy, then he's going to feel those.

53:58.920 --> 54:00.360
Let him know how weird it is.

54:00.360 --> 54:03.400
Also, only do this to this person in the restroom.

54:05.720 --> 54:07.240
That'll really break him of this habit.

54:07.960 --> 54:08.680
Hey, hey.

54:09.720 --> 54:10.920
Nice penis.

54:10.920 --> 54:11.800
Boink, boink.

54:12.840 --> 54:15.000
Is it appropriate to leave a small party?

54:15.000 --> 54:15.880
Six people.

54:15.880 --> 54:20.360
When someone puts on Gangnam style and asks everyone to start dancing.

54:20.360 --> 54:21.800
That's from Unsure in Oklahoma.

54:21.800 --> 54:22.920
Oh, this is the shittiest.

54:22.920 --> 54:24.920
Oops, you're in the shittiest party.

54:24.920 --> 54:29.320
I would actually argue that six people does not constitute a small party.

54:29.320 --> 54:33.640
Well, it's not a party until Gangnam style comes on and then uh oh, it is.

54:33.640 --> 54:36.360
It is a small party in the Dungeons and Dragons sense,

54:37.560 --> 54:39.560
but not in the typical social sense.

54:39.560 --> 54:44.440
Here's, okay, the verbiage in this question that really throws me off.

54:44.440 --> 54:47.160
He said, if you had asked, is it appropriate to leave a small party

54:47.160 --> 54:50.840
when someone puts on Gangnam style and everyone starts dancing?

54:50.840 --> 54:54.040
Yeah, if you leave that, if you leave that, then you're a stick in the mud.

54:54.040 --> 54:54.760
Uh huh.

54:54.760 --> 54:58.920
But if you, when someone puts on Gangnam style and asks everyone.

54:58.920 --> 55:00.200
Attention, please.

55:00.840 --> 55:01.880
Attention, please.

55:01.880 --> 55:03.320
Can we all rise to our feet?

55:04.040 --> 55:06.040
I'm going to teach everyone the dance.

55:06.920 --> 55:08.360
I learned it from YouTube.

55:09.480 --> 55:10.120
Lever up.

55:10.120 --> 55:15.160
Move your legs from side to side as if you were straddling an invisible pony.

55:20.520 --> 55:22.520
Dance, you beautiful bastards.

55:22.520 --> 55:24.280
This, we are golden gods.

55:25.160 --> 55:29.320
There, the fun thing about this question is that this person has already lived this scenario

55:29.320 --> 55:31.000
and one of two things happened.

55:31.000 --> 55:36.840
Either they, they feel bad because someone said everyone start dancing to Gangnam style

55:36.840 --> 55:39.080
and they said, I'm leaving.

55:39.080 --> 55:41.080
And then they walked out the door and never looked back.

55:41.080 --> 55:45.800
Or they did do it and they dance and they're wondering, was there another way?

55:45.800 --> 55:47.400
Was there an alternate option?

55:47.400 --> 55:51.240
Now, I think it was the former and I think the next day the host of the party,

55:51.240 --> 55:56.920
this, this psychopath who dictates when the dancing occurs,

55:56.920 --> 56:00.120
she came up to them and was like, hey, what the fuck, man?

56:00.120 --> 56:01.880
Like we were having a great time last night.

56:01.880 --> 56:03.480
That was inappropriate, Dave.

56:03.480 --> 56:05.640
You left and then there were only five people

56:05.640 --> 56:07.880
and that definitely doesn't count as a party anymore.

56:07.880 --> 56:09.000
You ruined my birthday.

56:10.040 --> 56:13.080
Oh, what if the host of the party was Psy?

56:13.080 --> 56:15.080
Oh, that is egomaniacal.

56:15.080 --> 56:18.520
And he put on his own song and he said, please, it's all I have.

56:18.520 --> 56:23.400
I don't think there's an organism on earth that is more sick of that song than,

56:24.120 --> 56:25.560
than Dr. Psy.

56:25.560 --> 56:28.440
I think I have to assume nobody likes his ballads.

56:28.440 --> 56:29.080
You know what I mean?

56:30.040 --> 56:32.440
Nobody likes his likes his tender lovemaking stuff.

56:33.400 --> 56:36.120
Everybody will try to get into gentlemen, but they're not feeling it.

56:36.120 --> 56:36.520
People.

56:36.520 --> 56:36.760
Yeah.

56:36.760 --> 56:39.640
People, people listen to gentlemen out of fucking courtesy.

56:39.640 --> 56:40.200
You know what I mean?

56:40.760 --> 56:43.160
But the hook, the hook, we owe him this one.

56:43.160 --> 56:43.640
Yeah.

56:43.640 --> 56:47.320
He's given us so much and we in turn have also given him quite a bit.

56:47.320 --> 56:47.880
Yeah.

56:47.880 --> 56:49.560
But the hook on that one does not bring me back.

56:50.120 --> 56:53.640
It's sort of like, it's sort of like how people continue to listen to

56:53.640 --> 56:55.640
If It Makes You Happy by Sheryl Crow

56:55.640 --> 56:59.080
because they, they really appreciated all I want to do so much.

56:59.080 --> 57:02.040
And it was like they, they did all they could do for all I want to do.

57:02.040 --> 57:04.120
They bought the single, they bought the album.

57:04.120 --> 57:06.920
And then when that next album came out with It Makes You Happy,

57:06.920 --> 57:07.880
they thought, well, you know what?

57:07.880 --> 57:08.840
I still owe her.

57:08.840 --> 57:12.360
I am still in debt to her for all the fun that first song brought me.

57:12.360 --> 57:12.520
Right.

57:13.880 --> 57:15.480
Yeah, it's exactly, it's exactly like that.

57:15.480 --> 57:16.520
Yeah.

57:16.520 --> 57:18.680
There's so many similarities between Psy and Sheryl Crow

57:18.680 --> 57:20.360
that I feel like a lot of people just like goes right over their head.

57:20.360 --> 57:22.280
Have you ever seen them in the same room together?

57:22.280 --> 57:23.160
I have not.

57:23.160 --> 57:24.120
No, I have not.

57:24.840 --> 57:26.360
Could it be a Phoenix rebirth?

57:27.400 --> 57:30.040
You think Sheryl, did Sheryl Crow fucking die?

57:30.040 --> 57:33.400
No, I'm saying that Sheryl Crow met with like her advisors

57:33.400 --> 57:35.000
and she said, I need a new persona.

57:35.000 --> 57:35.320
And they said-

57:35.320 --> 57:37.080
She went to Phoenix online university.

57:38.920 --> 57:40.760
Took some classes in Korean.

57:40.760 --> 57:44.200
And she took a minor in hammer dancing.

57:46.520 --> 57:47.880
Did you guys see that mashup?

57:47.880 --> 57:49.880
Oh, that went down good.

57:49.880 --> 57:51.480
When the two of them performed that together,

57:53.000 --> 57:54.600
that's when I knew it wasn't Sheryl Crow

57:54.600 --> 57:56.120
because she's a notorious racist.

57:57.720 --> 57:58.520
A lot of people know that.

57:58.520 --> 58:02.280
All I want to do is have fun with white people.

58:04.680 --> 58:07.560
You probably wouldn't know that she's not a terrific racist

58:07.560 --> 58:09.640
by looking at the crowds at her shows.

58:09.640 --> 58:12.200
You would assume that this is just a place

58:12.200 --> 58:13.800
where non-white people are not allowed.

58:13.800 --> 58:15.960
But that does explain all the Sheryl Crow laws.

58:22.840 --> 58:24.680
Fuck, I've got some history into it.

58:24.680 --> 58:25.560
Good work, Travis.

58:27.560 --> 58:31.320
Hey, Travis, Travis, I'm proud of the reference you just made.

58:31.320 --> 58:32.040
Thank you, Griffin.

58:32.600 --> 58:34.840
That's an emotional word that's never experienced.

58:36.040 --> 58:38.360
I'm proud of your Sheryl Crow joke.

58:38.360 --> 58:39.720
That's one they don't know.

58:39.720 --> 58:42.760
Hey, listen, thank you so much for spending an hour with us,

58:42.760 --> 58:44.120
my brother, my brother, me.

58:44.120 --> 58:45.960
We really hope you've had as much fun

58:45.960 --> 58:48.440
as we pretended to have listening to the show.

58:49.560 --> 58:52.120
Thank you to people tweeting about it.

58:52.120 --> 58:54.280
Kembo Soup tweeted,

58:54.280 --> 58:57.240
Sexabunga, it's Pride weekend in SF.

58:57.240 --> 58:59.480
What did we fucking say?

59:00.760 --> 59:02.760
What did we explicitly say?

59:02.760 --> 59:05.000
We explicitly said, don't type that out.

59:05.720 --> 59:07.080
Don't ever put it in text.

59:07.080 --> 59:09.000
But he's on blast and he knows it,

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
so I'm sure he feels terrible.

59:11.000 --> 59:12.760
Michael Harrison, thank you.

59:12.760 --> 59:16.040
Vincent Perea, maybe.

59:16.040 --> 59:18.280
Mason Church, Claire, Large Demon,

59:18.280 --> 59:20.920
Brianna Cole, Kat, Josh Renner,

59:20.920 --> 59:23.400
Trevor Wattman, Paul Peacock,

59:23.400 --> 59:25.240
Eric Edens, Justin Blankenship.

59:25.240 --> 59:27.560
Thank you so much, everybody tweeting about the show.

59:27.560 --> 59:29.800
Hey, maybe tweet out a sampler of our show.

59:29.800 --> 59:33.640
It's bit.ly forward slash mbmbam2013.

59:33.640 --> 59:37.160
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters

59:37.160 --> 59:38.120
for the use of our theme song

59:38.120 --> 59:39.320
instead of departure off the album,

59:39.320 --> 59:40.680
Putting the Days to Bed.

59:40.680 --> 59:41.960
Did you buy that yet, folks?

59:41.960 --> 59:43.000
Did you, hey, go get that album.

59:43.000 --> 59:43.960
Let me just really quick,

59:43.960 --> 59:45.720
can I look at your bank statement

59:45.720 --> 59:49.000
and see if there's a Telltale iTunes receipt on there?

59:49.720 --> 59:50.600
Thank you, John Roderick.

59:51.560 --> 59:54.280
Also, Juice, mention the PO box.

59:54.280 --> 59:55.320
We haven't mentioned that in a while.

59:55.880 --> 59:57.560
Oh yeah, we have a mailbox

59:57.560 --> 01:00:03.320
where you can send us physical objects of your affection.

01:00:03.960 --> 01:00:06.840
Please don't send any more weird things.

01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:08.680
We got another weird envelope

01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:10.760
that just had like six unrelated items in it

01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:12.360
and that really skeezes me out.

01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:13.480
Please don't do that.

01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:15.800
And don't now do it as like a joke about that.

01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:17.080
Like I won't enjoy it.

01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:19.800
We have expressly said that's our least favorite thing.

01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:22.360
But if you want to send us wedding invitations, go for it.

01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:23.880
Yeah, those are always sweet.

01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:28.920
PO box 54, Huntington, West Virginia, 25706.

01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:31.960
We got one from Morocco.

01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:36.200
It's in the Sahara from Bill, Bill Andrews.

01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:39.800
He's in Marrakesh, Morocco.

01:00:40.600 --> 01:00:40.920
Awesome.

01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:42.360
Oh, I had no idea what you were talking about.

01:00:42.360 --> 01:00:43.080
You said Morocco.

01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:44.440
Nobody shortens that to that.

01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:46.520
I'm just telling you what it says.

01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:47.800
Why wouldn't you say Rocco?

01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:51.080
I'm in the co.

01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:52.520
He's in the, and it's real

01:00:52.520 --> 01:00:55.720
because there's like weird stamps I don't recognize.

01:00:55.720 --> 01:00:57.080
So thank you to Bill.

01:00:57.080 --> 01:00:59.080
That's a really cool postcard to get and I'll put it.

01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:01.320
I've been looking at it and brings me great joy.

01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:01.880
Thank you, Bill.

01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:05.640
Also, everyone should check out our other max fun podcast.

01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:09.400
We're growing every, it seems like every day.

01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:13.480
And most recently, we've added a new podcast called saw bones

01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:17.480
featuring our own Justin McRoy and Sydney McRoy, his wonderful wife.

01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:20.680
The latest episode is about Mercury.

01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:21.400
It's really great.

01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:25.320
Check it out and thank you so much for listening.

01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:27.080
We got one more question from Griffin

01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:29.400
and he's going to drop it on us and then we'll come back

01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:31.640
and revisit it next week and give you the secret answer

01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:32.280
that we've been cooking.

01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:36.360
That joke has got to stop because people are going to start expecting.

01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:38.520
No one's noticed yet.

01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:39.080
It is.

01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:41.640
If you buy our iPhone app, you too could hear this.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:43.720
Don't buy the iPhone.

01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:45.080
It's called the MBNBA app.

01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:46.200
It's great.

01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:46.920
Don't worry.

01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:47.960
We won't.

01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:50.680
We won't say it out loud, but you can find it hidden.

01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:51.960
If you look hard enough, I'm not going to.

01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:53.960
I'm not going to send you your portion of the money.

01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:57.320
If you keep saying three and a half dollars that we've made with it.

01:01:58.760 --> 01:01:59.240
All right.

01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:00.280
I'm keeping it for myself.

01:02:00.280 --> 01:02:01.720
Taking myself out to a nice steak dinner.

01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:03.640
This this is not going to be admit.

01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:08.680
You can you could you can enter the Ponderosa lobby with three dollars and 50 cents.

01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:12.120
This final who is sent in by Ravi Patel.

01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:12.840
Thank you, Ravi.

01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:16.040
It's by Yahoo answers user Tiff 24 who asks.

01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:20.360
How would you describe the difference in Tia and Tamera's personalities?

01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:23.560
I'm Justin.

01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:24.120
I'm Travis.

01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:24.680
I'm Griffin.

01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:27.320
This has been my brother, my brother, me.

01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:28.360
Kiss your dad.

01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:47.960
Squire on the lips.
