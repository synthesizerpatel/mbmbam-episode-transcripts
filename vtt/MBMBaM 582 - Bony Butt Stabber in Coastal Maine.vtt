WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

00:05.760 --> 00:10.580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

00:11.480 --> 00:17.660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

00:17.660 --> 00:30.660
What's up, you cool, baby?

00:47.660 --> 00:50.060
It's better it's better with you

00:53.980 --> 00:55.980
It's better it's better

01:00.300 --> 01:02.300
Better it's better

01:02.300 --> 01:09.500
It's better it's better with you

01:11.300 --> 01:17.660
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother my brother and me an advice show for the modern era

01:17.820 --> 01:22.380
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy. I'm your middlest brother big dog Travis

01:23.220 --> 01:29.700
McElroy, and this is your sweet baby brother Griffin McElroy eating Pizza Hut and taking ibuprofen

01:29.700 --> 01:33.380
Ibuprofen over here in my Nike shoes and all of them are good

01:34.060 --> 01:38.340
You know as I sip this Folgers brand coffee. Yeah, just think about

01:38.980 --> 01:44.060
How lucky I am, you know, I woke up. I sat up straight up in my Casper bed this morning

01:44.060 --> 01:51.640
Yes, and I pushed the the bull and brand sheets away and I thought how lucky are we to get to live?

01:51.980 --> 01:55.820
This life, you know what I mean as I rubbed the zest soap

01:55.820 --> 02:00.940
All my body and got truly zestfully what flavor says what flavor is zest you rockin?

02:01.380 --> 02:07.060
Explosive orange. Yeah, that one's a little too intense for me. Yeah, it's got those popping bubbles in it

02:07.060 --> 02:12.380
Yeah, if you're a listener at home, you're probably a little bit lost here. So let me bring you in a little bit

02:13.540 --> 02:20.060
We were nominated by the I heart radio podcast Awards, which we instantly cared quite a bit about

02:20.060 --> 02:22.360
Yes, as soon as I saw my name on there

02:22.360 --> 02:28.260
I knew it was legit for best best comedy podcast who cares but best ad read

02:28.940 --> 02:34.500
I when I got the news, I was eating my favorite dishes at the old spaghetti factory and

02:35.300 --> 02:37.300
Really savoring the good flavors in my mouth

02:37.940 --> 02:40.180
And I just could not believe my eyes

02:40.780 --> 02:46.220
This is a problem because I was actually eating at the Olive Garden when I saw it and Olive Garden

02:46.780 --> 02:49.220
Actually paid me to say fuck the old spaghetti

02:49.220 --> 02:51.700
Oh shit guys. Yeah

02:53.100 --> 02:57.620
Imagine a carousel. Yeah, and you're on it and it's taking you

02:58.900 --> 03:05.940
Spinning you wildly round and round and round and through the crowd as you spin you see the face of your grandfather

03:05.940 --> 03:09.280
But that can't be your grandfather. He's been

03:09.780 --> 03:11.780
Dead for many many years

03:11.940 --> 03:18.700
You continue to spin around and round and you see him and he looks at you and dead in the eyes

03:18.700 --> 03:23.660
And he says I forgive you and then the next one around he says

03:24.260 --> 03:28.940
Eat Frito-Lay brand corn chips. Oh powerful stuff now

03:28.940 --> 03:33.700
Is that the racist grandfather or just like your regular one? I feel like we have

03:34.980 --> 03:36.980
Kind of racist we can all agree

03:38.540 --> 03:42.660
Racist if it's not right. I don't think it's racist. It feels a little racist

03:42.660 --> 03:46.700
This is the kind of stuff that snagged us that nomination by the way

03:46.700 --> 03:52.540
Yeah, I mean remember that time when Griffin talked about how babble would help you engage in oral sex

03:52.540 --> 03:58.120
I want to start I want to start being in the meetings where they try to sell our show to advertisers

03:58.120 --> 04:00.120
I could be a real dick

04:00.140 --> 04:03.740
Like what you want the best of the biz you want the best of the biz?

04:03.820 --> 04:07.180
It's a fuck's me up. I heart radio had to have listened

04:07.740 --> 04:13.820
To and and Travis brings up a good point if it was the one where I talked about how babble will make you better

04:13.820 --> 04:15.820
oral sex

04:15.820 --> 04:17.820
That's crazy

04:19.020 --> 04:21.740
Here's what I like to think there are many let's be honest

04:21.740 --> 04:27.380
There are many that would not only get us not on this list. They would get us banned for these awards

04:27.380 --> 04:29.260
Yeah, the FCC would have some problems

04:29.260 --> 04:34.860
I have a theory that what happened was they put four podcasts on the list that they'd listen to and they're like

04:34.860 --> 04:36.860
I wish I make a five every other categories five

04:36.900 --> 04:40.620
Does anyone else listen any podcasts where they have funny reads and like one guy was like?

04:40.620 --> 04:46.780
My brother my brother me. Oh, yeah, none of us have ever listened to that show. What kind of what are their ad reads like?

04:50.300 --> 04:52.300
They're not dirty are they Derek

04:54.780 --> 04:58.220
To the point they don't like make fun of the brand or

04:58.340 --> 05:04.220
Talk about how like Squarespace is sounds kind of like if you said like like a circle area and that you're competing website

05:04.220 --> 05:11.500
No, they would never do that. All right. We got chatty broads with Becca and Jess. They're up there in the

05:12.940 --> 05:18.540
Fantastic advertisers. Yeah great advertisers couldn't know Brian needs a friend. Does it seem

05:19.820 --> 05:21.660
You know

05:21.660 --> 05:26.660
Literally with Rob Lowe like it those two they've got their they've got Emmys and shit

05:26.660 --> 05:32.260
Probably they got other they don't they don't need this and the I heart radio podcast awards love a story

05:32.260 --> 05:38.280
Yeah, yeah, they love a story and I feel like those guys don't need and Rob Lowe's thing is always like

05:39.580 --> 05:45.620
Squatty potty literally saved my butthole like it's like and it's always that it's like

05:45.900 --> 05:51.620
Pizza Hut literally tastes good the cheese in my mouth and it's like we get it dude. Hey, guess what?

05:51.620 --> 05:54.740
Rob Lowe has never eaten Pizza Hut. No

05:54.740 --> 06:05.180
Or pooped. That's the kind of real shit we bring. All the ads that motherfucker could do are like skin-tight lycra

06:05.180 --> 06:11.060
We all love it, but can't we all wear our exercise bike? The vegetable council would love to

06:12.620 --> 06:14.620
Lamborghini chafing is a big deal

06:20.620 --> 06:22.620
We all experience it from time to time

06:22.620 --> 06:24.620
Listen, we've all been there, you know

06:25.340 --> 06:31.300
Smartless, which is well our net Jason Bateman and Sean Hayes. This is a two-horse race. This is this is us and Jenny

06:31.300 --> 06:36.220
Bronson these other people cannot wait. It's not fair. Of course, they do good batteries. They're professionals

06:36.220 --> 06:37.860
Yeah, we're JV

06:37.860 --> 06:43.740
Not the JV club another great podcast the maximum fun Network, but we're the we're the you know, yeah

06:43.740 --> 06:47.660
Yeah, absolutely and listen all of them the the Conan O'Brien

06:47.660 --> 06:52.180
Smartless literally, I'm pretty sure they're nominated for other categories, right?

06:52.180 --> 06:57.220
So this is this is the like, you know, the the best sound editing which don't get me wrong

06:57.220 --> 07:00.900
So anything's very important, but this is where our movies gonna win, right?

07:00.900 --> 07:07.260
Like sure we can put on the box of an I heart radio podcast award-winning podcast, right?

07:07.260 --> 07:14.380
I mean, I feel like they're pull they're trying to pull like if we give it to smartless. Do we get

07:14.380 --> 07:18.780
Are these guys at the award? Oh, right, right. Oh, yeah, I get that

07:19.580 --> 07:26.160
Can we get these guys if they're there, you know, if we if they win certainly sir. Yeah, they'll be there

07:26.300 --> 07:32.220
We're bones dudes. Yeah, we're both. Yeah, they'll probably just give us the best comedy one. Oh

07:33.100 --> 07:34.860
Damn, I know

07:34.860 --> 07:38.700
Damn, that's smartless. I was kind of thinking that they would do like

07:38.700 --> 07:46.260
You know, a lot of these are like 12 episodes. They're out there every week. Yeah, I'm putting in the work, you know

07:46.260 --> 07:49.260
I know. I mean shout shout out to them. They're consistent

07:49.980 --> 07:51.980
especially for people who have things

07:51.980 --> 07:58.780
Things going on lots of other things. Yeah of our two shows one of us has a Ozark guy in it

07:58.780 --> 08:02.540
That should be that's true. And it's true. It's not

08:02.540 --> 08:06.820
I'm not on the I'm not on those arcs. I was actually edited out

08:07.500 --> 08:11.780
I was but I was supposed to have a four episode arc and they cut me out of all four

08:11.780 --> 08:14.860
I was mr. I was mr. Drugs. You remember that character I do

08:15.140 --> 08:20.580
Yeah, I was like Billy the former mayor and much-beloved figure around town. Then they see

08:21.220 --> 08:23.220
It I did it

08:23.300 --> 08:25.300
And I don't know

08:26.460 --> 08:28.460
Yeah flip it off though

08:28.460 --> 08:31.960
They sold smartless to Amazon

08:32.940 --> 08:34.940
We're fucking ride or die

08:36.260 --> 08:41.380
They love that story. Yeah in these chatty broads is Indy too. Damn it. It's okay

08:43.100 --> 08:45.100
Yeah, we're not entirely

08:46.580 --> 08:52.240
On the show. Yeah, it's already any point be like you're out carrot top French Stewart

08:52.240 --> 09:00.520
Kelsey grammar, you're the new snort. Well, hey look at that. Hey I heart right now Amazon could go to them and say you have to do

09:01.040 --> 09:02.160

You know racist brand chips and they have to do it. They have

09:06.760 --> 09:09.840

09:26.300 --> 09:28.820
Very flattered that you put us in best comedy podcast

09:28.820 --> 09:31.940
I do like that we're up there in best comedy and down at the bottom

09:31.940 --> 09:38.700
It's like podcast to watch films to be buried with with Brett Goldstein one of the most famous people on the planet right now

09:38.700 --> 09:46.320
Brett Goldstein watch. Hey us three established fellows are gonna tell you watch that young whippersnapper of Brett Goldstein

Don't mention our show by name

10:13.640 --> 10:19.640
Stop their bad sport. Yes. Yes. Now the ball's in their court. That's a good sport

10:20.920 --> 10:26.680
Sean I know you're listening just it. Hey one Justin tuna Jason you get the idea

10:29.400 --> 10:35.800
And I heart radio one other thing to consider is that our daddy gave you the best years of his life the best years

10:35.800 --> 10:36.600
of his life

10:36.600 --> 10:39.240
You also do I want to highlight though that it is

10:39.240 --> 10:46.540
91 days away until the podcast award and the chance that I will remember this in 90 days. Yeah, very slight unless that

10:47.200 --> 10:52.000
Until the Hardy shows up in your mailbox. Oh, absolutely. I just assumed we get an invite

10:52.040 --> 10:56.700
They're not gonna make if we will well, that'll be a good indication. Oh, that'll be a great

10:59.320 --> 11:03.280
Is to be there no, I mean you can come if you want

11:03.960 --> 11:05.960
You might make mr. Bate would

11:05.960 --> 11:10.940
Oh, we can just cut to some cardboard cutouts. It's fine

11:13.180 --> 11:19.060
Wait, yeah, I want to send him a picture of myself for the cardboard cutout and it's me like nodding understandably

11:21.060 --> 11:23.540
That makes sense. Yeah. Oh I get it

11:25.260 --> 11:29.980
Okay, I get it. Hey, we got a strong crop of questions. Yeah, let's get busy

11:31.300 --> 11:34.020
Today's the birthday of my roommate unlikely

11:34.020 --> 11:35.100
exactly

11:35.100 --> 11:36.780
considering that

11:36.780 --> 11:42.540
You know, we're reading it whenever they have no control over the temperature of this but perhaps when it was written

11:42.540 --> 11:45.000
I have to assume that's it Justin

11:45.000 --> 11:49.540
I don't think this was a moving target thing trying to time it out who is a good friend of mine good

11:49.540 --> 11:56.060
I do not usually make things but this year I got some help from my girlfriend and made a homemade pumpkin pie from scratch

11:56.500 --> 11:57.740
nummy

11:57.740 --> 11:59.300
nummy numbers

11:59.300 --> 12:02.160
It's the right season for that. You don't want to make that in like May

12:02.160 --> 12:07.540
Yeah, even pureed the pumpkin ourselves rookie mistake, but okay. Yeah, you can buy that you can just buy that

12:07.760 --> 12:09.360
Don't don't waste your time

12:09.360 --> 12:12.060
Don't make anything. Yeah, just buy a pumpkin pie

12:12.680 --> 12:20.120
Roommate was grateful for the pie, but after a quiet night without any birthday festivities. She has not yet eaten any of the pie. Okay

12:20.880 --> 12:22.800
I'm a selfish man

12:22.800 --> 12:26.280
homemade pie something that my heart and my tummy greatly desires

12:26.280 --> 12:32.600
How do I get them to eat some of this pie so that I can have some that's from pie problems in Portland

12:32.600 --> 12:36.360
That's a topic. Let me just start off by letting you off the hook a little bit

12:36.360 --> 12:40.280
You may have homemade pie from scratch. You're not selfish. You're human

12:40.280 --> 12:45.080
If you're human of your time, you've seen that pies that you put the hard work into that pie, right?

12:45.080 --> 12:49.920
You did a little bit of the little red hen who will help me plant the wheat who will help me harvest the wheat

12:49.920 --> 12:55.640
Right, you made the pie and now you're looking at that pie and you want to have a little flizzy for your work

12:55.640 --> 12:58.960
I get it. Yeah, there's nothing wrong with that at all

12:59.640 --> 13:03.040
Let me say this. Yeah, if you're listening to this on

13:04.420 --> 13:10.520
Monday the 18th. Yeah of October don't eat them. Don't eat the part

13:11.360 --> 13:13.360
Okay, it's too late. Oh

13:13.560 --> 13:18.880
You miss their chance so I can help in that sense. Don't eat don't need the pie. Let me tell you

13:18.880 --> 13:21.200
Here's the secret, right? I've I figured this out

13:21.200 --> 13:26.280
When there is any kind of birthday thing you bake a thing you make a thing whatever, right?

13:26.280 --> 13:30.640
Yeah, shake a thing you shake a thing you take a thing you like a thing you

13:31.440 --> 13:36.640
Everybody like Bella thing everybody's waiting for the first cut. Yeah, right

13:37.880 --> 13:39.800
You have to

13:39.800 --> 13:41.800
Justin you okay? I just

13:42.640 --> 13:46.880
Yeah, I had to stand up. Okay, so I had to stand up cuz like

13:46.880 --> 13:52.160
Go ahead. Try us you fishy. Well, you got to make the first cut right? And so I make the first you gotta make the

13:52.160 --> 13:58.480
First cut and so at some point you just have to start slicing things up and putting them on plates and saying who wants it

13:58.480 --> 14:04.420
Right, because otherwise everybody's waiting for when is it time for it? I don't want to be the person who asked for it

14:05.000 --> 14:07.200
You just got you just gotta start serving it

14:07.200 --> 14:12.060
They should they should make pie molds that look like a slice is already missing

14:12.060 --> 14:17.020
Yeah bait when you make it and so people just assume like it's go time also

14:17.020 --> 14:18.340
Do you have whipped cream there?

14:18.340 --> 14:24.900
Cuz if there's if there's pumpkin to kinder pie that person is waiting for the whipping cream to go with I saw one on America's

14:24.900 --> 14:27.740
Test kitchen, you know what they did last night. It's actually Cook's Country. What's the difference?

14:27.740 --> 14:32.300
They put some melted milk powder into their whipped cream. Oh, yes

14:32.820 --> 14:36.620
Hey you question asker you fucked up

14:36.620 --> 14:43.660
You fucked up you can't put this kind of baked good pressure on somebody that lives with you

14:43.660 --> 14:47.060
Yeah, because you need to be able okay. Here's the way

14:47.060 --> 14:53.260
Here's the way baked good baked goods gift if you give someone a baked good, right and you say please enjoy they say

14:53.260 --> 14:55.100
Oh, thank you

14:55.100 --> 14:59.940
Thank you. I'm gonna take this. Hope a week later. They bring you back a cleaned

14:59.940 --> 15:07.580
High plate they say thank you. It was delicious, right your heart in your head say they ate the whole thing

15:07.860 --> 15:09.860
Maybe even in one sitting

15:09.900 --> 15:14.060
Maybe one sitting they loved it so much couldn't put it down. They did not

15:14.780 --> 15:19.940
Fold up a business card and shovel two-thirds of it into the trash can right that didn't happen

15:20.220 --> 15:24.940
They ate as much as they wanted and that might have been almost none

15:24.940 --> 15:31.380
Right, but you now have put them in the situation where every bite every nibble is

15:32.220 --> 15:36.060
Going to be under your watchful. Eye. What if they cut a slice? Uh-huh

15:36.740 --> 15:40.740
While you're just trying to enjoy TV together. You're just trying to watch

15:41.460 --> 15:43.460
Survivor together they cut a slice

15:43.900 --> 15:50.020
They know that they are now going to consume this pie under the watchful eye of Sauron

15:50.020 --> 15:57.140
Yeah, you're gonna be every move every micro micro taste every micro machine every micro. No, there's no micro machine

15:57.140 --> 15:58.980
Well, they don't know here's the thing Justin

15:58.980 --> 16:03.900
It's even worse than that because if you're good friends with a roommate, they know you don't normally bake things

16:03.900 --> 16:04.660
Oh, yeah

16:04.660 --> 16:12.540
The pressure's so on and they watch you maybe like puree it yourself or you said like you're in the world and they're like

16:13.180 --> 16:17.260
Have you ever pure it there in their head? They're thinking have I ever seen them puree anything before?

16:17.260 --> 16:21.180
Do they know if it was done? How did that happen to you? What was that?

16:21.180 --> 16:25.300
That was just my chair pushing my chair all the way. I decided I'm not gonna need it this whole episode. Listen

16:25.580 --> 16:31.840
It's too much when you do everything yourself from scratch. There's so much room for error. Did you leave?

16:32.020 --> 16:35.980
Did you leave a mess? Yeah, did you leave a mess?

16:36.180 --> 16:40.140
Because I wouldn't be happy to get the pie that did the mess that broke my heart

16:41.380 --> 16:45.380
For sure for sure. I would say 48 hours have passed you can just cut into it

16:45.380 --> 16:51.740
I think you can go nuts after I think after 30 you have you have to ask it's insane

16:51.740 --> 16:54.260
Not to think about the flipside of this question if we received it

16:54.260 --> 16:58.840
It was like my roommate baked me a pie and it was really sweet and then they cut into that motherfucker

16:58.940 --> 17:01.680
Like I was saving it to show my mom on FaceTime

17:02.140 --> 17:05.820
Yeah, and she's been in Bermuda this whole time. And so I had to wait

17:05.820 --> 17:08.820
There is a massive difference between a pie with a tiny

17:08.820 --> 17:15.900
Half inch slice out of it and a pie that is untouched pie that is untouched you could take to a bake sale

17:15.900 --> 17:20.660
yeah, you could take to the a pie that is untouched has has value you could take it to a

17:21.820 --> 17:23.820
Pawn shop. Oh

17:23.900 --> 17:29.780
Aftermarket the pie aftermarket is very very lucrative right now. Yeah, you have there's a market for that

17:29.780 --> 17:31.780
You could take it to someone else's house and be like, I

17:32.820 --> 17:36.860
Made pie. I mean, you know the pie things that people say cool. Yeah, that is happening

17:36.860 --> 17:41.980
by the way, the big good the second hand big good has happened to me many times where it's like, oh, yeah, my

17:42.540 --> 17:48.580
In-laws gave this to me, but they gave me too much. So now I'm giving it to you and it's like

17:48.580 --> 17:50.300
Oh, I'm not gonna eat that

17:50.300 --> 17:55.300
Like there's just something about that where like I know at this point like oh, I'm really appreciative of this

17:55.380 --> 17:59.580
It's gonna sit on the counter for X number of days before I go

17:59.580 --> 18:02.300
Ah, man, I should have eaten that and then I'm gonna throw it away

18:02.300 --> 18:07.300
Like there's something about the disconnect where it just fades from my memory like Brigadoon

18:07.420 --> 18:13.660
Yeah, my trick my trick is I'll bake something really delicious cuz you know me that's a good trick, you know me

18:13.660 --> 18:18.020
I'll bring I make something really delicious. I'll try a slice. I'm like, this is really good

18:18.020 --> 18:21.620
And if I have this in the house, I'm gonna eat this whole fucking thing. Yeah, it's so good

18:21.660 --> 18:26.580
So then I'll take it over to Sydney's parents house. I'll say hey time at this point

18:26.580 --> 18:29.420
You got a Mary and Tommy's I think everyone marry Tommy's house in

18:29.420 --> 18:33.220
It's like Tommy. You gotta try this pumpkin cake and then I'll just like

18:34.460 --> 18:39.820
Accidentally leave it there. Yeah, knowing full well that he'll consume the entire thing for breakfast

18:39.820 --> 18:43.980
So I'm basically using my father-in-law as a more ethical garbage can

18:43.980 --> 18:49.460
There you go using his body like a like a more ethical trash can that makes me feel good cuz it nourished

18:49.460 --> 18:51.620
You know what? I mean it nourished somebody

18:52.500 --> 18:56.700
Do you ever think that this is what how when you go to like the supermarket?

18:56.700 --> 19:00.260
And you see they're selling like a half pie and that like half pie container

19:00.460 --> 19:06.460
that like the person baked it in the grocery store and they went I can have a little piece and pretty soon half the

19:06.460 --> 19:08.460
Pie was gone and they were like, oh no

19:08.860 --> 19:16.020
And they had to build a special container to just sell half a pie and it just kept happening because damn those pies look good

19:16.020 --> 19:21.740
They do look good though. I you know, he gets the time he gets the little guy pies, you know

19:21.740 --> 19:28.820
Tommy does Tommy gets the little guy. He goes to Walmart. He gets a little guy pie and it's a personal, you know

19:28.820 --> 19:33.880
I've heard pot, you know personal pie pie a personal pie a little guy pie

19:34.580 --> 19:36.180
Hey

19:36.180 --> 19:40.740
Do you guys want to approach the Wizards Throne? We talking wait, is he in it?

19:41.180 --> 19:48.100
Yeah, were you guys tracking how long we just talked about pie because it was it was a big it was a big pie talk

19:48.100 --> 19:53.180
You know, it's a great question. Hurry up. You could do a pie chart of how much time we spent talking about pie

19:53.180 --> 19:59.020
That's funny Marlena sent this one in and it's just like a it's I wish I had this one when kovats started

19:59.020 --> 20:02.780
Cuz I don't know about you guys, but I got pretty fucking bored. Oh, yeah

20:03.460 --> 20:07.740
During kovat stuff like starting like like it's hard for me to remember what things were like back then

20:07.740 --> 20:11.660
Yeah, it's kovats. They were it's wicked a lot like how it is

20:12.660 --> 20:14.900
Presently this feels that way sometimes to them

20:14.900 --> 20:19.980
Yeah, I'll like all the time but it's okay because now we're gonna teach you how to pass time

20:20.660 --> 20:26.420
This one was co-authored. I didn't know that this was something you had to actively do. I have this explains so much

20:26.500 --> 20:33.380
Yeah, you have to really force your body to move forward through the time stream. Yeah, it was co-authored by Lucy

20:33.380 --> 20:37.780
Yeah, so let's get into it. There's so much stuff here guys

20:38.740 --> 20:40.740
method one doing stuff

20:40.740 --> 20:46.260
Oh awesome so far. That's that's pretty brassy to put that out number one. Yeah

20:47.300 --> 20:52.860
Stuff is a big that's a big the big hit open with number two not doing stuff

20:52.940 --> 20:57.860
Yeah, so the first the very first thing you need to pass the time why not dance around?

20:58.380 --> 21:00.180
Have a dance party just for yourself

21:00.180 --> 21:06.300
if you're in a place where you can't dance choreograph a dance inside your head to your favorite song and I know that Ellen's

21:06.300 --> 21:11.820
in hot water, but I for her whole thing, but I bet you

21:12.420 --> 21:15.900
That she's kind of stoked to not have to do that show anymore

21:15.900 --> 21:18.740
Cuz now she can just like when the spirit moves her

21:18.960 --> 21:22.380
She doesn't have to wait to be in front of an audience and just have a little dance

21:22.740 --> 21:25.540
Yeah, why would I want to dance if no one is watching?

21:26.260 --> 21:28.260
Yes, exactly

21:28.260 --> 21:29.380
I

21:29.380 --> 21:33.740
Think choreographing a dance in your head to entertain yourself. Yeah, I mean

21:33.740 --> 21:35.740
I

21:35.820 --> 21:40.260
Was gonna say that's pretty wild I guess that's how choreographers do it right? Yeah, that's true

21:40.260 --> 21:44.260
That's I know if you have a gift or not until you start choreographing things in your brain

21:44.580 --> 21:51.500
Yeah, Travis wall one day was just like waiting in a long line at Target. He was like, ooh, actually that would look fucking cool

21:54.460 --> 21:57.820
Watch me do this and tell me if it looks good cuz I can't see myself from here

21:57.820 --> 22:00.660
Oh, no, no Travis Travis. Sorry Travis wall can't dance

22:00.660 --> 22:04.980
He just does the the dance moves in his brain, you know

22:06.620 --> 22:09.860
He just makes the brain dancers in his dreamscape dance

22:09.940 --> 22:13.700
But when he tries to do him with his body and it's frustrating because when he's showing something he's like, all right

22:13.700 --> 22:19.300
So you want to twist your arms like then and do him like this and people like Travis you need to stop pal

22:19.980 --> 22:23.060
I organize your movie shelf that we all have

22:23.700 --> 22:28.540
Oh now this is good because a lot of people talk about do you do by genre do you do it?

22:28.540 --> 22:33.620
You know by director by year. No by color. Oh, that's one of the yeah

22:33.620 --> 22:35.820
That's one of the options here traps the spine color

22:35.820 --> 22:40.980
It's great. If you don't have any movies nearby just rank your favorite movies in your head or read books

22:41.320 --> 22:43.320
Hey, you can't wait

22:44.420 --> 22:48.780
One of the oldest ways to pass time in the history of exist

22:49.180 --> 22:56.580
like humanity has been killing time by looking at ink on paper for thousands of years and you

22:56.580 --> 23:02.700
Get in with that movie shelf that you throw that in underneath. Oh you'd organize your movies, I guess

23:02.700 --> 23:08.700
Yeah, and then I'll skip that like I'm not gonna read that that's wild and then they slip in there, you know

23:09.700 --> 23:11.700
No, read books. Yeah, you could

23:12.420 --> 23:17.420
Escape into the wonderful world of literature that could take you anywhere as long as your mind is willing to accept it

23:17.420 --> 23:23.020
Or you could figure out the right order from Pixar movies. Yeah, it's so mad at my

23:23.020 --> 23:28.180
At my ownership of any physical. Oh sure. Yeah, I haven't bought a movie

23:28.540 --> 23:33.380
Comprehend. Yeah, can't comprehend haven't bought a physical movie or book for that matter

23:33.380 --> 23:38.380
I think unless it's a reference book. I don't buy a lot of them, but I'll begin from get put them away

23:38.380 --> 23:42.500
I don't know when I want to watch season three of Penn and Teller's bullshit. I don't know. It's true

23:42.500 --> 23:43.180
No

23:43.180 --> 23:48.220
Could be any time I do like to have them for when people come over and I say look at that

23:48.220 --> 23:53.980
That's a thing. Look at it. That's my almost complete box set of lost

23:53.980 --> 23:58.300
I am missing a few discs from I loaned them to my friend Jeremy, and I'm never getting

23:59.860 --> 24:05.500
Write a song. All right, sorry, but whatever make up your own language. She be booby-dooby-gooby

24:05.980 --> 24:09.140
Love it. Good. We love it. You call me

24:09.140 --> 24:16.700
I called you a scooby-dooby-dooby-dooby and that's my language how is take a nap not number one. That's the number

24:16.700 --> 24:20.620
I've got time to kill. I've taken a nap. Take a nap is actually number two

24:21.220 --> 24:23.140
Yeah

24:23.140 --> 24:25.140
Not under do things

24:25.300 --> 24:28.380
It is this is all part of the do things umbrella

24:28.380 --> 24:36.100
Okay, clean organize or DIY your room fuck off. That's not passing time. That's work. That's chores doing stuff. I

24:36.860 --> 24:41.540
All right. Listen, we need to get back in our brainscape because the second method is using your imagination

24:41.540 --> 24:47.260
Imagination imagine conversations plug your ears and make up random things that people are saying around you

24:47.740 --> 24:49.340
Wait, awesome

24:49.340 --> 24:50.900
What?

24:50.900 --> 24:55.980
The action of a healthy person that is one of the wildest things I've ever heard

24:55.980 --> 25:01.820
It's not imagine a conversation you might have where you're doing both parts plug your ears and imagine

25:01.880 --> 25:05.220
You're a fly on the wall and people are talking around you

25:05.460 --> 25:08.860
Yeah, but like that sounds wild but you know

25:08.860 --> 25:12.700
That's what Stephen King is doing all the time 18 hours a day. Yeah

25:13.340 --> 25:17.220
Then the only way to quiet it is to write it down. It's a right

25:17.540 --> 25:24.560
He plugs his ears at a nice restaurant and just looks around. He just thinks like Jeremy. There's a big mummy behind you

25:25.500 --> 25:30.140
That's not that's not right Steven. I'm gonna do name the skateboard of ghost ravine

25:30.640 --> 25:36.380
Perfect when I put on this mask, it makes me into a skeleton that stabs butts. No

25:36.380 --> 25:37.380
Fuck

25:37.380 --> 25:39.380
Fuck that's not it. That's not it either

25:40.620 --> 25:49.620
Do you know what would be so dumb if I was Stephen King to drop a 50,000 word book about a skeleton that stabs butts on my editor's desk and be like

25:49.620 --> 25:53.620
It's the master of horror's mask

25:53.620 --> 25:58.620
You have to print it and if you change a word I'll burn this building down around

25:58.620 --> 26:05.620
Do you know who I am? I'm Stephen King. I'm Stephen King. This is my new vision. It's about a skeleton that stabs butts

26:05.620 --> 26:07.620
Oh print, mr. Bone of the butts

26:09.020 --> 26:11.860
Wait is Steven is there a 1.0? No

26:12.580 --> 26:15.060
Turn to page 800. There's a twist. Yep

26:15.060 --> 26:19.220
The knife turns people into skeletons and then they stab more butts now

26:19.220 --> 26:24.220
I know you're wondering does bony butt stabber live in coastal Maine and the answer is yes, of course

26:24.220 --> 26:26.220
He does

26:26.300 --> 26:33.140
And he loves the Red Sox now my butt my butts been stabbed I that's my job

26:33.140 --> 26:35.980
Fantastic right small butt stab under the but not squash

26:36.900 --> 26:39.100
Are you some kind of skeleton? Wow?

26:40.740 --> 26:44.940
Imagine Grover's Corners never saw a butt stabber like mr. Bono before

26:46.580 --> 26:52.260
You've never seen anyone from Maine with the way that you are doing this accident correction

26:52.260 --> 26:57.300
I was I was the dad of the girl. Mr. Webb in in our newspaper man

26:57.300 --> 27:03.860
Mm-hmm. Okay. He's the editor of the newspaper down in global. I still remember all the words from my partner our town

27:03.860 --> 27:07.780
I used I would say this is our town. That's what we like it that way

27:07.780 --> 27:13.940
All I remember is that's all right smart farm. All right, smart. All right. Okay, so there's so much more guys, please

27:14.140 --> 27:16.140
Imagine that you're a spy. Okay, cool

27:16.340 --> 27:21.780
Yes, I do that. Well, what if you're already a spy trying to pass time? Yeah, then imagine you're just

27:23.100 --> 27:24.860
You work out office

27:24.860 --> 27:32.500
My name's Doug photocopy photocopy photocopy. Oh, does anyone you have does anyone tried the new office milk?

27:32.500 --> 27:33.700
Oh

27:33.700 --> 27:35.700
No, I stopped. I forgot. I'm a spy

27:37.060 --> 27:39.980
That's how the new James Bond movie ends by the way, yeah

27:40.220 --> 27:44.020
Put yourself this way yourself in someone else's head blah blah blah assign superpowers

27:44.260 --> 27:48.460
Decide what superpowers everyone in the room would have try to be creative but keep the powers useful

27:50.220 --> 27:52.100
Okay

27:52.100 --> 27:57.060
This is exhausting. It sounds so hard. Yeah. Okay. Well then let's try this next one because it could be this one

27:57.060 --> 27:59.060
I think is a pretty fun way to pass the time

28:00.020 --> 28:02.020
Imagine your past loved ones

28:02.220 --> 28:07.760
Have an imaginary conversation with someone that you love that has passed on what would they say about where you are in life now?

28:07.760 --> 28:10.240
What would they say about what the afterlife life is like?

28:12.380 --> 28:19.280
Normal way to kick it on a Thursday afternoon. I got ten minutes of the DMV. Hey me ma

28:19.280 --> 28:26.240
What's the internal rest like? What's the damn this stop light this stop? I say forever. Don't you think so rush limbaugh?

28:29.160 --> 28:34.280
Then that's fun cuz you can make him be like, oh I pooped my pants hell is bad. I

28:36.200 --> 28:44.000
Bet though the libs made this stop light the libs love their gotta go a devil stab me in the butt and I'm turning into a

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
skeleton

28:46.000 --> 28:50.800
It's all real. It's all very real Stephen King was right

28:54.480 --> 28:56.480
We should have listened

28:57.320 --> 28:59.320
He tried to warn us

29:00.120 --> 29:02.120
It was a prophecy

29:03.400 --> 29:05.400
And they loved the Red Sox

29:08.920 --> 29:11.800
Buddy what's never is a documentary. I keep doing

29:11.800 --> 29:17.240
Everybody why don't they listen to me? Why didn't we come up with a name for documentary for books?

29:19.320 --> 29:23.640
I tried to say book you better and they laughed me out of the room. It's real

29:23.640 --> 29:29.160
Oh, there's no word for vocabulary, but he does

29:37.480 --> 29:42.760
We are halfway through play a game with yourself for other people whatever start a new TV show, okay play a prank

29:43.320 --> 29:49.080
It's better to start a new TV show. We've tried that one many many times. It's very unsatisfying. It takes a long time

29:49.080 --> 29:55.120
All right, trust me you end up in a lot of zoom calls pitching your idea and then nobody wants it. Yeah

29:56.040 --> 30:02.240
Step five on I'm skipping a lot now step five of having fun is read a book. So they said they do circle that boy

30:02.760 --> 30:03.960
Yeah

30:03.960 --> 30:05.960
this next one hits

30:06.040 --> 30:13.080
So paradoxical so fucking fast. Okay, we are we've moved on to the last subsection method for being productive

30:13.680 --> 30:17.520
first step one use the Internet

30:17.520 --> 30:19.520
But no

30:19.560 --> 30:22.040
That's not what being productive is

30:22.680 --> 30:30.160
Just go to YouTube or Wikipedia reddit and boing boing. I am very productive on boing boing today

30:31.880 --> 30:36.000
Okay exercise barf make a friend yeah, it's that easy

30:37.320 --> 30:42.320

39:38.220 --> 39:40.700
Something thick and crimson.

42:49.020 --> 42:49.860
That's more just saying-

You didn't hear about the dirt and worms?

42:51.740 --> 42:52.580

42:53.420 --> 42:55.660
It's just saying like, are you willing to take the dare

42:55.660 --> 42:57.940
to do the work that someone else could have done for you

42:57.940 --> 42:59.540
for the same price?

42:59.540 --> 43:01.500
But your kids would love to do this

43:01.500 --> 43:02.580
and make a huge mess. No, they won't.

43:02.580 --> 43:04.060
They'll start for three seconds

43:04.060 --> 43:06.180
and then I'll have to do it. Make a huge mess.

43:06.180 --> 43:08.460
Justin's kids love to do shit.

43:08.460 --> 43:09.380
And make a huge mess.

43:09.380 --> 43:11.900
My kids like the idea of it.

43:11.900 --> 43:15.420
And then they remember that apparently I work for them.

43:15.420 --> 43:16.620
This is the scariest one of all.

43:16.620 --> 43:17.980
Oh, fuck.

43:17.980 --> 43:20.820
I don't want you to be too terrified when I launch in.

43:20.820 --> 43:24.860
So make sure you've braced yourself for true terror

43:24.860 --> 43:27.220
because once I reveal to you the name

43:27.220 --> 43:31.060
that Krispy Kreme has chosen for their Halloween lineup,

43:31.060 --> 43:34.100
you will be chilled to the very bone.

43:34.100 --> 43:36.740
You will look to the edge of existence

43:36.740 --> 43:38.620
and you will be insane for it.

43:38.620 --> 43:39.460
Okay.

43:39.460 --> 43:40.300
Okay.

43:40.300 --> 43:41.340
Are you ready for this?

43:41.340 --> 43:42.180
I guess so.

43:42.180 --> 43:43.020
Are you fully braced?

43:43.020 --> 43:44.260
Yeah, no, I'm, yeah.

43:44.260 --> 43:47.140
I told Guillermo del Toro this, he shit his own pants.

43:47.140 --> 43:48.420
Oh, wow.

43:48.420 --> 43:49.260
Yeah.

43:49.260 --> 43:50.100
You know Guillermo del Toro now?

43:50.100 --> 43:51.660
You've gotten so big.

43:51.660 --> 43:53.340
Thank you, yes.

43:53.340 --> 43:54.500
He's a dear friend.

43:54.500 --> 43:55.700
Okay. Named Robert.

43:55.700 --> 43:59.740
Krispy Kreme launches Halloween lineup of

44:01.500 --> 44:03.380
Krispy Scream Donuts.

44:03.380 --> 44:04.220
No!

44:04.220 --> 44:05.780
No!

44:05.780 --> 44:07.620
I've driven myself mad.

44:07.620 --> 44:08.820
No!

44:08.820 --> 44:10.580
I'm now from terror.

44:10.580 --> 44:12.180
Oh, God.

44:12.180 --> 44:15.500
The darkness, it's everywhere.

44:15.500 --> 44:17.060
Under a witchy theme,

44:17.060 --> 44:19.740
Krispy Kreme has transformed to Krispy Scream.

44:19.740 --> 44:21.060
I said it again.

44:21.060 --> 44:22.820
I have to stop saying it.

44:22.820 --> 44:23.660
Ah!

44:24.940 --> 44:29.740
They complete with a very scary logo change.

44:29.740 --> 44:30.580
All right.

44:30.580 --> 44:31.420
That actually just sounds expensive.

44:31.420 --> 44:36.420
Free donuts and the treat of a dollar dozen every Saturday.

44:36.980 --> 44:37.980
Okay.

44:37.980 --> 44:41.580
Plus, a free donut offer on Halloween.

44:41.580 --> 44:44.860
Beginning today, well, it's a while ago,

44:44.860 --> 44:47.780
beginning last Monday, Krispy Scream fans

44:47.780 --> 44:49.620
will be enchanted by four new donuts.

44:49.620 --> 44:52.180
Even when you kind of whisper it, it still like hurts.

44:52.180 --> 44:53.020
Yeah.

44:53.020 --> 44:53.860
It is hard, isn't it?

44:53.860 --> 44:55.060
There's new donuts.

44:55.060 --> 44:57.340
Who's the first one?

44:57.340 --> 44:58.780
Abracadabra.

44:58.780 --> 44:59.620
Abracadabra.

44:59.620 --> 45:02.980
Abracadabra donut.

45:02.980 --> 45:04.180
It's a long walk.

45:04.180 --> 45:05.940
It's a little sweaty, this one.

45:05.940 --> 45:08.260
This one comes with a little extra sweat.

45:08.260 --> 45:10.220
It's like, it's a donut.

45:10.220 --> 45:12.340
Enchanted Cauldron Donut.

45:12.340 --> 45:14.700
It's chocolate with a pretzel witch broomstick.

45:14.700 --> 45:16.820
Do you think that they came up with them in that order

45:16.820 --> 45:19.460
where they're like put a lot of work into abracadabra

45:19.460 --> 45:20.300
and then they were just like,

45:20.300 --> 45:22.620
and this one's like an enchanted cauldron,

45:22.620 --> 45:24.620
so we're just gonna call it that.

45:24.620 --> 45:27.060
Bewitched Broomstick Donut,

45:27.060 --> 45:31.820
which is an unglazed shell donut dipped in purple icing

45:31.820 --> 45:34.540
decorated with icing swirl and gold stars.

45:34.540 --> 45:35.380
Okay.

45:35.380 --> 45:38.700
And then most terrifying of all, the Spooky Sprinkled.

45:38.700 --> 45:41.460
It's orange icing and topped with,

45:42.700 --> 45:46.620
I shudder to this Halloween sprinkle.

45:46.620 --> 45:49.020
Again, it rears its head.

45:49.020 --> 45:49.940
I shit myself.

45:49.940 --> 45:52.900
Saturday's beginning October 16th to Halloween

45:52.900 --> 45:54.900
will be scary great.

45:54.900 --> 45:57.740
It's like fairy, but spooky.

45:57.740 --> 46:01.420
For Krispy Scream fans who can give a dollar a dozen

46:01.420 --> 46:02.620
to share with family and friends

46:02.620 --> 46:04.140
with the purchase of any dozen.

46:05.060 --> 46:09.500
They call them Saturday Scary Sherries.

46:09.500 --> 46:10.340
Huh.

46:11.700 --> 46:12.540
Huh.

46:13.460 --> 46:15.820
Even, I tell this to Richard Scary,

46:15.820 --> 46:18.140
he barf on his children.

46:18.140 --> 46:20.740
Even Richard Scary driven insane by this.

46:20.740 --> 46:22.740
I bet his children are adults at this point too,

46:22.740 --> 46:24.540
so that's gotta be wild.

46:24.540 --> 46:27.020
Let's just hope they're not litigious.

46:27.020 --> 46:30.060
We all deserve an incredibly great Halloween this year.

46:30.060 --> 46:30.900
Here we go.

46:30.900 --> 46:35.100
Still, we just have to keep referencing

46:35.100 --> 46:38.060
the fact that this is a bad time.

46:38.060 --> 46:41.100
And certainly the curry is a donut.

46:41.100 --> 46:44.020
We all deserve an incredibly great Halloween this year

46:44.020 --> 46:47.020
because of the ongoing COVID pandemic.

46:47.020 --> 46:49.020
It doesn't say this, but it's implied.

46:49.020 --> 46:53.460
So we're turning to Krispy Scream for the month

46:53.460 --> 46:56.780
and scaring up some amazing Halloween donuts

46:56.780 --> 46:59.460
along with some spooky good deals.

46:59.460 --> 47:00.700
This is Dave Skinner.

47:00.700 --> 47:02.660
I probably didn't even need to tell you.

47:02.660 --> 47:05.060
You could tell it Dave Skinner by the way.

47:05.060 --> 47:09.580
Help us have fun too by coming by on Halloween in costume.

47:09.580 --> 47:10.420
Oh boy.

47:10.420 --> 47:13.780
And we'll give you a free donut.

47:16.060 --> 47:18.180
Now you can share how you've been entranced

47:18.180 --> 47:20.580
by Krispy Scream's new donuts.

47:20.580 --> 47:22.140
No, I'm actually getting pretty in here too.

47:22.140 --> 47:25.860
This is what they want you to do

47:25.860 --> 47:30.860
for this incredible, incredible event.

47:30.860 --> 47:34.060
Hashtag Krispy Scream.

47:34.060 --> 47:39.060
They say that if you type hashtag Krispy Scream

47:39.060 --> 47:43.700
into your social media, it will make you insane

47:43.700 --> 47:45.900
and also your family be insane too

47:45.900 --> 47:48.060
and everyone driven mad by darkness.

47:48.060 --> 47:48.900
By tweeting it?

47:48.900 --> 47:53.100
Yeah, if you tweet the hashtag Krispy Scream,

47:53.100 --> 47:55.500
then you could be the first one to be driven mad

47:55.500 --> 47:56.340
by this incredible promotion.

47:56.340 --> 47:58.380
Don't be the last on your block.

47:58.380 --> 48:00.460
No, that would be so embarrassing.

48:00.460 --> 48:02.100
Now I will say this.

48:02.100 --> 48:05.860
Oh, Krispy, so they've already, this is confusing, right?

48:05.860 --> 48:08.580
Cause they already smell cream bad

48:08.580 --> 48:10.660
and then they're adding in the scream.

48:10.660 --> 48:11.980
It's very confusing.

48:11.980 --> 48:13.980
I've tried to do it three times.

48:15.220 --> 48:16.420
Here we go.

48:16.420 --> 48:17.900
Krispy.

48:17.900 --> 48:21.020
Let's just see the kind of heat this tag's been getting.

48:21.020 --> 48:23.700
Oh, there's not many.

48:23.700 --> 48:27.100
You know, here's the thing.

48:27.100 --> 48:30.060
We could take over this hashtag.

48:30.060 --> 48:31.660
No, Donut.

48:31.660 --> 48:34.980
We could own this.

48:34.980 --> 48:37.220
We could own this hashtag.

48:37.220 --> 48:38.620
Here's Krispy Scream.

48:38.620 --> 48:39.780
There's five tweets.

48:39.780 --> 48:40.620
Let's take this.

48:40.620 --> 48:42.340
Now Count Donut, we can do this on one.

48:42.340 --> 48:44.380
Let's have this hashtag for our very own.

48:44.380 --> 48:46.260
Here's the thing Count Donut, we can do this,

48:46.260 --> 48:48.820
but the tweets that you do

48:48.820 --> 48:51.900
have to be completely and utterly innocuous.

48:51.900 --> 48:53.940
Like had a great day.

48:53.940 --> 48:54.780
Oh man.

48:54.780 --> 48:56.100
You guys see that tree?

48:56.100 --> 48:57.060
Krispy Scream.

48:57.060 --> 48:59.780
That's the only way I will allow this Count Donut.

49:01.260 --> 49:03.460
That seems more harmful than talking about

49:03.460 --> 49:06.460
how these donuts have driven you to the brink of madness.

49:06.460 --> 49:07.700
Okay, then let's do that.

49:07.700 --> 49:10.020
Just use the tag to tell how the donuts

49:10.020 --> 49:11.340
have driven you mad.

49:11.340 --> 49:12.180
Yeah, okay.

49:12.180 --> 49:14.700
Yeah, now I can get on board with that.

49:14.700 --> 49:19.700
Yes, I want to take over this K-R-I-S-P-Y-S-K-R-E-N-E.

49:20.180 --> 49:22.060
Oh, it's spelled bad too, huh?

49:22.060 --> 49:24.940
It's spelled so bad, so it's ours now.

49:24.940 --> 49:28.140
And we'll use it for just horror.

49:28.140 --> 49:32.100
Just absolute Lovecraftian nightmare.

49:32.100 --> 49:34.220
Yeah, there you go.

49:34.220 --> 49:36.220
About the dark ones and the donuts.

49:36.220 --> 49:38.500
So anyway, get the donuts.

49:38.500 --> 49:40.740
Or don't, whatever.

49:40.740 --> 49:43.300
Eat the donuts or don't, it's up to you.

49:43.300 --> 49:44.860
You're starting to sound a lot like Richard Stink,

49:44.860 --> 49:45.700
Mr. Dracula.

49:45.700 --> 49:46.820
Yeah, a little bit.

49:46.820 --> 49:48.820
How about another one of these great questions?

49:48.820 --> 49:50.700
I must bring Justin back to life one more time.

49:50.700 --> 49:51.540
Oh God, you killed him?

49:51.540 --> 49:52.380
Why do people-

49:52.380 --> 49:53.220
I kill him every time I do this.

49:53.220 --> 49:54.580
People keep killing Justin.

49:54.580 --> 49:56.100
Do you want me to read the question?

49:56.100 --> 49:57.580
No.

49:57.580 --> 49:59.460
Sorry, it's still me, I was a vape.

49:59.460 --> 50:01.300
Okay, yeah, go ahead and get your vape stand.

50:01.300 --> 50:04.820
Did the huge, huge rip off my vape.

50:04.820 --> 50:07.140
One sec, let me rip this cotton out.

50:08.380 --> 50:10.380
All right, here's Justin.

50:10.380 --> 50:11.220
Hey guys. Hi.

50:11.220 --> 50:13.540
Oh man, you've vaped it up.

50:13.540 --> 50:14.660
Such a huge cloud.

50:14.660 --> 50:15.500
Blood vape.

50:15.500 --> 50:17.020
Is it blood flavor?

50:17.020 --> 50:18.620
It's blood flavor.

50:18.620 --> 50:19.780
No, sorry, blood orange.

50:19.780 --> 50:21.220
I misread the file.

50:21.220 --> 50:22.260
That's refreshing.

50:22.260 --> 50:24.340
We said we were gonna do a lot of questions this time.

50:24.340 --> 50:25.180
We're gonna fire these off.

50:25.180 --> 50:26.020
We're gonna get more.

50:26.020 --> 50:26.860
You ready?

50:26.860 --> 50:29.460
I'm in a new city for work and on my walk to my job,

50:29.460 --> 50:32.140
I pass a house with a trampoline in the side yard.

50:32.140 --> 50:34.380
There is very little division between the yard

50:34.380 --> 50:35.900
and the sidewalk and the trampoline is no more

50:35.900 --> 50:37.780
than 15 feet from me as I pass.

50:37.780 --> 50:39.340
Brothers, what is the protocol for using

50:39.340 --> 50:40.180
a stranger's trampoline?

50:40.180 --> 50:41.340
Rip it.

50:41.340 --> 50:46.340
Is it stealing if I just hop on for a few bounces

50:47.300 --> 50:48.420
on my way to work?

50:49.340 --> 50:50.980
That's from grounded in Greenboro.

50:50.980 --> 50:53.260
Yes, let's just, can we, boys, please?

50:53.260 --> 50:55.900
Yes, it's stealing.

50:55.900 --> 50:57.140
You, it's stealing.

50:57.140 --> 50:59.740
You all know there's other crimes other than stealing,

50:59.740 --> 51:00.580
right?

51:00.580 --> 51:02.060
Yeah. Yeah.

51:02.060 --> 51:04.260
There's like, one might be trespassing.

51:04.260 --> 51:05.220
That's one, yeah.

51:05.220 --> 51:06.060
One that you might do.

51:06.060 --> 51:06.900
Trespassing.

51:06.900 --> 51:07.740
It's don't do.

51:07.740 --> 51:08.580
Trespassing.

51:08.580 --> 51:12.820
But for real, there's some great questions on this week.

51:12.820 --> 51:16.140
Don't bounce on a stranger's trampoline.

51:16.140 --> 51:17.240
What, why?

51:18.300 --> 51:20.940
Justin, if you had a trampoline in your yard,

51:20.940 --> 51:21.980
if you had a trampoline in your yard

51:21.980 --> 51:25.660
and you looked outside and there was a stranger rando adult

51:25.660 --> 51:27.440
having a bounce on their way to work

51:27.440 --> 51:28.940
with their briefcase and everything.

51:28.940 --> 51:29.760
Should be polite about it.

51:29.760 --> 51:30.600
What?

51:30.600 --> 51:31.440
Oh, wait, hold on, Griffin.

51:31.440 --> 51:32.260
You actually just sold it for me

51:32.260 --> 51:34.380
because if they have a briefcase and everything,

51:34.380 --> 51:35.220
then this is-

51:35.220 --> 51:36.660
It's a businessman who's like finally free.

51:36.660 --> 51:38.500
This is a full blown music video moment

51:38.500 --> 51:39.340
and I'm here for it, Griffin.

51:39.340 --> 51:41.300
Yeah, I freed the businessman.

51:41.300 --> 51:42.140
Okay.

51:42.140 --> 51:42.960
That's the only way that it's-

51:42.960 --> 51:43.800
I think that's the one time.

51:43.800 --> 51:45.720
The only time that's acceptable.

51:45.720 --> 51:48.020
If you're holding to like a travel mug of coffee

51:48.020 --> 51:50.460
that you're drinking from while you're bouncing

51:50.460 --> 51:54.500
and you have your briefcase in one hand

51:54.500 --> 51:56.900
and full like suit, then it's okay.

51:56.900 --> 51:59.840
But if you're doing it in grownup clothes,

51:59.840 --> 52:04.140
looking at me through the window, completely stone-faced.

52:05.420 --> 52:06.260
With a thumbs up.

52:06.260 --> 52:07.980
With a thumbs up, you must leave.

52:07.980 --> 52:08.980
Or I must.

52:08.980 --> 52:11.100
Next question.

52:11.100 --> 52:12.440
There's a security guard at work

52:12.440 --> 52:14.060
who keeps on trying to scare me.

52:14.060 --> 52:16.780
They regularly sneak upon me and go boo

52:16.780 --> 52:18.860
or jump out at me from behind doors.

52:18.860 --> 52:20.660
They're not very good at scaring me

52:20.660 --> 52:23.580
and their scares never seem to get the desired reaction.

52:23.580 --> 52:26.500
This is a problem seeing as they're an amazing cook

52:26.500 --> 52:27.900
and are known to give free food

52:27.900 --> 52:29.340
to people they scare successfully.

52:29.340 --> 52:30.900
What is this business?

52:30.900 --> 52:35.100
I have tried their cooking at pre-pandemic potlucks

52:35.100 --> 52:37.620
and still dream of their coconut shrimp to this day.

52:37.620 --> 52:39.620
How do I give a convincing enough performance

52:39.620 --> 52:41.740
to arm me some delicious seafood curry?

52:41.740 --> 52:43.620
That's from a hungry, hungry museum worker.

52:43.620 --> 52:44.460
None of this makes any sense to me.

52:44.460 --> 52:46.240
Okay, the fact they work in a museum

52:46.240 --> 52:50.140
twists and turns this thing fucking completely for me.

52:50.140 --> 52:52.540
If it was an office and people were pulling this shit,

52:52.540 --> 52:54.700
it would be like, this is a place of business.

52:54.700 --> 52:58.020
But if someone is dressing up like the mummy

52:58.020 --> 53:00.260
or like Bony Butt Stabber

53:00.260 --> 53:04.060
and doing this in a museum setting, that's fun.

53:04.060 --> 53:05.620
I think that's pretty fun.

53:05.620 --> 53:07.580
Yep, absolutely fun.

53:07.580 --> 53:09.100
I think it's fun to get scared in a museum

53:09.100 --> 53:13.220
and then get yummy like red lobster appetizers out of it.

53:13.220 --> 53:14.800
Like that kicks ass to me.

53:15.900 --> 53:18.360
Yeah, that sounds choice.

53:18.360 --> 53:19.200
Now Justin-

53:19.200 --> 53:20.940
And I'd love to go to a museum.

53:20.940 --> 53:21.980
You guys remember those?

53:21.980 --> 53:22.820
I do.

53:22.820 --> 53:24.900
It's like a big house full of old things.

53:24.900 --> 53:26.460
And at night they come to life

53:26.460 --> 53:27.300
and they give you life lessons.

53:27.300 --> 53:28.900
At night, every one of them comes to life.

53:28.900 --> 53:30.580
Love that shit.

53:30.580 --> 53:34.060
At hotel, they have pictures they hang on.

53:34.060 --> 53:35.740
This is like that, but bigger

53:35.740 --> 53:37.860
and the pictures are way better.

53:37.860 --> 53:38.700
Way better.

53:38.700 --> 53:40.780
And sometimes they're done by people whose names you know,

53:40.780 --> 53:41.620
which is nice.

53:41.620 --> 53:42.440
Right.

53:42.440 --> 53:43.280
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

53:43.280 --> 53:44.120
Whoa.

53:44.120 --> 53:46.260
Now we all three have kids

53:46.260 --> 53:47.100
and I don't know about you guys,

53:47.100 --> 53:49.860
but my kid B.B. tries to scare me

53:49.860 --> 53:52.860
by jumping out and saying boo a lot.

53:52.860 --> 53:53.700
Yeah.

53:53.700 --> 53:54.780
So I've really tried to perfect this,

53:54.780 --> 53:56.700
like, oh God, oh.

53:56.700 --> 53:57.540
Oh man.

53:57.540 --> 53:58.360
Yeah.

53:58.360 --> 53:59.300
Whoa.

53:59.300 --> 54:00.900
And then it's kind of a laugh, right?

54:00.900 --> 54:02.780
It's that like, oh my God.

54:02.780 --> 54:03.980
Oh, now a breath.

54:03.980 --> 54:05.020
Oh, I can see how funny.

54:05.020 --> 54:06.700
I'm so happy to be alive.

54:06.700 --> 54:07.600
And if you want to say like,

54:07.600 --> 54:09.420
I'm so happy to still be alive now

54:09.420 --> 54:10.700
because for a second there,

54:10.700 --> 54:12.580
I thought that the mummy was going to kill me.

54:12.580 --> 54:15.680
Oh man, I can't wait to eat coconut shrimp

54:15.680 --> 54:16.940
and feel alive, right?

54:16.940 --> 54:17.780
Something like that.

54:17.780 --> 54:18.600
Makes it worth it.

54:18.600 --> 54:19.440
Yeah, that's good stuff.

54:19.440 --> 54:20.280
That's good stuff.

54:20.280 --> 54:21.940
Man, the next coconut shrimp I eat

54:21.940 --> 54:23.540
will be the most tasty coconut shrimp

54:23.540 --> 54:25.260
I've ever had in my life.

54:25.260 --> 54:27.180
Henry's got this big plastic skeleton hand

54:27.180 --> 54:28.320
on the end of a long stick

54:28.320 --> 54:30.340
that he likes to use to like scare me,

54:30.340 --> 54:32.620
like wave it around a wall or something

54:32.620 --> 54:34.300
to make me think that bony butt stabber's coming for me.

54:34.300 --> 54:36.740
And after this recording, it will work every time.

54:36.740 --> 54:39.500
But yesterday he did hit me in the face with it accidentally.

54:39.500 --> 54:40.780
And guess what?

54:40.780 --> 54:41.620
Guess what?

54:41.620 --> 54:43.700
I am very scared of that skeleton hand now

54:43.700 --> 54:45.220
when it's in my boy's hands.

54:45.220 --> 54:46.460
I don't trust him as far as I can throw him.

54:46.460 --> 54:49.620
And I can throw him awfully far.

54:49.620 --> 54:52.500
That's a really good, can I just say, for his age,

54:52.500 --> 54:53.940
it's a pretty good gag.

54:53.940 --> 54:55.420
Pretty good gag, hitting your dad in the face

54:55.420 --> 54:56.260
with a big bony butt stabber.

54:56.260 --> 54:58.260
Another hit in the face part, but that's good too.

54:58.260 --> 54:59.960
I mean, listen, he's little,

54:59.960 --> 55:01.180
so I doubt he hurt you that much,

55:01.180 --> 55:02.860
but you do have that glass face.

55:03.740 --> 55:05.300
Yeah.

55:05.300 --> 55:06.540
Do we have time for this next one?

55:06.540 --> 55:07.380
It excites me.

55:07.380 --> 55:08.660
Yeah.

55:08.660 --> 55:10.180
I set a fire in my dorm room

55:10.180 --> 55:12.700
trying to microwave a Red Lobster cheesy biscuit.

55:12.700 --> 55:14.300
It's wild that we talked about Red Lobster twice.

55:14.300 --> 55:15.140
That is wild.

55:15.140 --> 55:16.380
Okay.

55:16.380 --> 55:17.980
And then I had Red Lobster last night.

55:17.980 --> 55:18.820
How was it?

55:18.820 --> 55:19.660
Was it shrimp?

55:19.660 --> 55:20.480
Shrimp?

55:20.480 --> 55:21.320
Shrimp was?

55:21.320 --> 55:22.160
Their Brussels sprouts are pretty banging.

55:22.160 --> 55:22.980
Okay.

55:22.980 --> 55:23.820
I like a Brussels sprout.

55:23.820 --> 55:24.660
Yeah.

55:24.660 --> 55:25.480
Yeah.

55:25.480 --> 55:26.320
I mean, you know I love the biscuits.

55:26.320 --> 55:27.160
They call me Cheddar Bay Jay.

55:27.160 --> 55:27.980
Yeah, they do.

55:27.980 --> 55:28.820
Of course.

55:28.820 --> 55:31.500
But the Brussels sprouts are surprisingly on point.

55:31.500 --> 55:32.340
Yeah.

55:32.340 --> 55:33.160
Okay.

55:33.160 --> 55:35.020
Hey, well, thank you for listening.

55:35.020 --> 55:37.500
Red Lobster never disappoints, except when it does.

55:37.500 --> 55:38.340
Yep.

55:38.340 --> 55:40.420
And when they fall, they fall hard, baby.

55:40.420 --> 55:42.820
Fire and ice, Red Lobster.

55:44.820 --> 55:46.580
My RA said I have to wait here

55:46.580 --> 55:48.900
until the fire department comes.

55:48.900 --> 55:50.900
I haven't had dinner and I'm very hungry.

55:50.900 --> 55:52.820
The only food I have in my room,

55:52.820 --> 55:54.660
my dorm, are microwave meals

55:54.660 --> 55:59.660
and a few remaining Red Lobster Cheesy Biscuits.

56:00.140 --> 56:02.060
Do I risk putting food back in the devices

56:02.060 --> 56:03.620
I've already destroyed with my biscuits so far

56:03.620 --> 56:06.660
or do I accept my fate of spitting the evening hungry?

56:06.660 --> 56:07.860
That's from Starving Student.

56:07.860 --> 56:09.820
I bet you any amount of money,

56:09.820 --> 56:13.580
the biscuits come in like a metal lined bag for the oven.

56:13.580 --> 56:15.860
I bet you any amount of money they microwaved it.

56:15.860 --> 56:16.700
Any amount.

56:16.700 --> 56:17.520
That's possible.

56:17.520 --> 56:18.360
I just love this like, all right,

56:18.360 --> 56:19.820
so tell me again what happened.

56:19.820 --> 56:22.680
Yeah, I microwaved the biscuit and it caught fire.

56:22.680 --> 56:23.520
No, I know.

56:23.520 --> 56:26.700
But then the second fire, oh, right, right, right.

56:26.700 --> 56:29.740
What did the second, third, and fourth fires come out of?

56:29.740 --> 56:32.020
Yes, I used my extremely powerful microwave.

56:32.020 --> 56:35.140
And my dad is an industrial scientist

56:35.140 --> 56:36.860
and he gave me one of their industrial microwaves

56:36.860 --> 56:38.900
for doing industrial stuff.

56:38.900 --> 56:41.700
The kind that you use to dry out big piles of wet wood.

56:41.700 --> 56:44.620
Yeah, I just put one of these Cheddar Bay Biscuits in there

56:44.620 --> 56:47.480
for the normal amount, 45 minutes, and.

56:47.480 --> 56:51.700
Oh, boy.

56:51.700 --> 56:55.700
I would do, I would, here's the thing, guys.

56:55.700 --> 56:59.360
You literally do have to risk it for the biscuit.

56:59.360 --> 57:00.200
Yep.

57:01.540 --> 57:04.220
A ship is safe in the harbor,

57:04.220 --> 57:08.100
but when you take it out to sea, it kicks ass.

57:08.100 --> 57:11.740
Yep, that's what they say, that old sailor saying.

57:11.740 --> 57:14.020
I think it would also be perfect if you could time it

57:14.020 --> 57:16.220
so that the microwave dings two seconds

57:16.220 --> 57:18.700
after the fire department opens your door.

57:18.700 --> 57:19.980
And they're just like looking at them like,

57:19.980 --> 57:22.020
can I get that, because that ramen's

57:22.020 --> 57:23.900
not gonna eat itself, you guys.

57:23.900 --> 57:27.620
Oh, yeah, sorry, it was on fire, not the ramen.

57:27.620 --> 57:28.620
You know what, I'm gonna eat this ramen,

57:28.620 --> 57:31.300
get out of your way, I'll be in the common room

57:31.300 --> 57:33.900
watching Bones, because it's always on.

57:33.900 --> 57:35.260
What's that, I'm arrested?

57:35.260 --> 57:36.100
That makes sense.

57:36.100 --> 57:38.580
Oh, no, wait, you're the fire department.

57:38.580 --> 57:42.420
You can't, you don't have that jurisdiction.

57:42.420 --> 57:45.460
I bet they do, they have to, for arson and stuff.

57:45.460 --> 57:46.380
Yeah, I guess.

57:46.380 --> 57:49.100
Hey, your RA's a dick.

57:49.100 --> 57:51.180
If I accidentally set a fire in my house

57:51.180 --> 57:53.180
and then somebody came up to me and was like,

57:53.180 --> 57:55.700
now sit in your shame.

57:55.700 --> 57:58.700
It's already an, I know I fucked up.

57:58.700 --> 58:01.340
I set a fire in the place I sleep in.

58:01.340 --> 58:02.900
I know I fucked up.

58:02.900 --> 58:04.820
I don't need the fire department to come say,

58:04.820 --> 58:07.300
did you know you did a fire where you sleep?

58:07.300 --> 58:09.380
Thanks, fire guys, I know.

58:09.380 --> 58:11.620
All fires are illegal.

58:11.620 --> 58:14.580
And so if you started a fire without their blessing,

58:14.580 --> 58:16.860
they will come down on you pretty hard.

58:16.860 --> 58:19.900
Hey, RA, listen, any RA listening,

58:19.900 --> 58:22.140
this is your chance to score major points.

58:22.140 --> 58:24.620
Because listen, this person is both embarrassed and hungry.

58:24.620 --> 58:28.340
You're gonna say, hey, here's five bucks,

58:28.340 --> 58:31.380
go get some food, I'll take this one, Doug.

58:31.380 --> 58:34.860
And right there, you're a hero.

58:34.860 --> 58:39.740
You're a hero to Doug, who, listen,

58:39.740 --> 58:42.020
question asker is a student, right?

58:42.020 --> 58:44.340
They're in that, oh, that's so weird transition

58:44.340 --> 58:46.340
between childhood and adulthood.

58:46.340 --> 58:49.180
And it's that worst time to tell a fire person

58:49.180 --> 58:52.460
that you set fire to a cheddar bay biscuit in a microwave.

58:52.460 --> 58:54.700
A five-year-old does this, it's fine.

58:54.700 --> 58:56.700
They're fine. It's funny, it's funny.

58:56.700 --> 58:59.420
A 45-year-old man sets fire to a cheesy biscuit,

58:59.420 --> 59:01.260
he answers to no one.

59:01.260 --> 59:04.820
But like a 19-year-old does this, no excuse.

59:04.820 --> 59:07.700
And you have to answer to someone, the worst.

59:08.580 --> 59:09.580
The worst.

59:09.580 --> 59:11.220
I'm sorry, it's hard being young,

59:11.220 --> 59:13.660
but there's good parts too.

59:13.660 --> 59:16.420
Like when you don't overcook the cheddar bay biscuit.

59:16.420 --> 59:18.500
Just cook them right, this is a learning experience.

59:18.500 --> 59:19.340
I bet you'll never do that again.

59:19.340 --> 59:20.540
Probably. Yeah.

59:20.540 --> 59:22.060
But maybe you might.

59:23.140 --> 59:24.620
You might immediately afterwards,

59:24.620 --> 59:25.940
according to this question.

59:25.940 --> 59:26.780
Yeah.

59:27.940 --> 59:29.740
They've learned nothing.

59:29.740 --> 59:32.060
Thank you so much for listening to our podcast.

59:32.060 --> 59:33.660
I hope you've learned something

59:33.660 --> 59:35.940
throughout the course of this experience,

59:35.940 --> 59:37.180
or else we haven't done our job.

59:37.180 --> 59:40.140
Hey, you wanna come, you wanna watch us do a live show?

59:40.140 --> 59:43.140
Come to your computer, not to a physical location.

59:43.140 --> 59:46.140
Do you wanna go to a computer or a TV or whatever,

59:46.140 --> 59:47.460
and watch us do a Taz show?

59:47.460 --> 59:49.900
We're gonna be doing Hootenanny part three.

59:49.900 --> 59:51.500
What do we agree on for a title?

59:51.500 --> 59:53.740
I mean, Hootenanny three is the only thing that makes sense,

59:53.740 --> 59:56.020
but I do think we landed on Threetnanny.

59:56.020 --> 59:57.660
Yeah. Threetnanny, okay.

59:57.660 --> 59:59.580
Threetnanny was just really good and right there,

59:59.580 --> 01:00:00.700
and so we had to kind of keep going with it.

01:00:00.700 --> 01:00:02.660
I wanted to call it Threetnanny two,

01:00:02.660 --> 01:00:05.100
but like, I thought that would be confusing.

01:00:05.100 --> 01:00:07.140
There's a space, it's a space cowboy opera.

01:00:07.140 --> 01:00:10.700
It's November 5th, 9 p.m., tickets are 10 bucks.

01:00:10.700 --> 01:00:13.500
It's a bit.ly forward slash Taz virtual,

01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:15.460
and the VOD video on demand.

01:00:15.460 --> 01:00:17.260
It's available for two weeks after the show.

01:00:17.260 --> 01:00:18.780
If you haven't seen Hootenanny,

01:00:18.780 --> 01:00:20.780
there's a recap on our YouTube channel

01:00:20.780 --> 01:00:25.260
to catch you up with the story so far, such as it is,

01:00:25.260 --> 01:00:27.460
and I will be indulging in that.

01:00:27.460 --> 01:00:28.860
Yes, absolutely.

01:00:28.860 --> 01:00:31.340
You will know exactly the things that I know

01:00:31.340 --> 01:00:33.020
about the Hootenanny story.

01:00:33.020 --> 01:00:36.380
Also, very exciting tickets for the shows

01:00:36.380 --> 01:00:39.940
at Emerald City Comic Con go on sale October 28th.

01:00:39.940 --> 01:00:41.460
It's gonna be My Brother, My Brother and Me

01:00:41.460 --> 01:00:45.100
on December 2nd, and Taz on December 3rd.

01:00:45.100 --> 01:00:47.180
Both shows will be general attendance,

01:00:47.180 --> 01:00:48.820
so no assigned seating,

01:00:48.820 --> 01:00:52.740
but there will be ADA-compliant seating available.

01:00:52.740 --> 01:00:55.620
You do not need an Emerald City Comic Con badge

01:00:55.620 --> 01:00:57.500
to buy tickets to the shows,

01:00:57.500 --> 01:00:59.980
but you will need tickets to the shows, obviously,

01:00:59.980 --> 01:01:03.740
and Emerald City Comic Con has safety protocols in place,

01:01:03.740 --> 01:01:06.500
including require proof of full vaccination

01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:09.060
or a recent negative COVID test to attend,

01:01:09.060 --> 01:01:12.540
and in addition, masks are required while on the premises

01:01:12.540 --> 01:01:14.460
and capacity is going to be reduced.

01:01:14.460 --> 01:01:16.780
If you wanna check out more info on the show,

01:01:16.780 --> 01:01:19.580
including the full health and safety protocols,

01:01:19.580 --> 01:01:21.540
as well as ticket links and all that stuff,

01:01:21.540 --> 01:01:25.900
it's available at bit.ly slash McElroyTour.

01:01:25.900 --> 01:01:28.900
Thanks to Montaigne for the use of our theme song,

01:01:28.900 --> 01:01:29.980
My Life is Better with You.

01:01:29.980 --> 01:01:33.940
You can find that on the internets

01:01:33.940 --> 01:01:38.940
and on Books A Million, probably has it.

01:01:40.740 --> 01:01:41.900
I don't know about that.

01:01:41.900 --> 01:01:43.340
It's just those two places.

01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:46.100
Make sure you check out macromerch.com,

01:01:46.100 --> 01:01:47.420
get that pin of the month,

01:01:47.420 --> 01:01:51.900
which is Hellraven, AKA Del Craven, from Taz Just Us.

01:01:51.900 --> 01:01:54.060
That benefits the National Latina Institute

01:01:54.060 --> 01:01:55.060
for Reproductive Rights,

01:01:55.060 --> 01:01:56.740
which builds Latina and Latinx power

01:01:56.740 --> 01:01:58.660
to fight for the fundamental human right

01:01:58.660 --> 01:02:01.220
to reproductive health, dignity, and justice.

01:02:01.220 --> 01:02:02.780
There's a lot of other stuff on there.

01:02:02.780 --> 01:02:03.820
In case you missed the news,

01:02:03.820 --> 01:02:06.540
we've been doing Taz Weekly for a while now.

01:02:06.540 --> 01:02:09.300
So this is a good chance to jump in on Ether C.

01:02:09.300 --> 01:02:11.860

01:02:11.860 --> 01:02:14.740

01:02:37.260 --> 01:02:38.140
Yes. Sure.

01:02:38.140 --> 01:02:43.140
This final Yahoo was sent in by Derek.

01:02:43.380 --> 01:02:44.220
Okay.

01:02:45.060 --> 01:02:46.260
Jeter.

01:02:46.260 --> 01:02:47.500
Oh.

01:02:47.500 --> 01:02:49.260
And thank you, Derek.

01:02:49.260 --> 01:02:50.660
Thank you, Derek Jeter.

01:02:50.660 --> 01:02:52.980
It's asked by Yahoo Answers user.

01:02:56.100 --> 01:02:57.260
Sorry?

01:02:57.260 --> 01:02:58.180
I think you cut out.

01:02:58.180 --> 01:02:59.420
Yeah.

01:02:59.420 --> 01:03:01.980
My microphone has a short in it.

01:03:01.980 --> 01:03:04.380
It's asked by Yahoo Answers user.

01:03:07.980 --> 01:03:09.380
Pikachu.

01:03:09.380 --> 01:03:10.340
Whoa.

01:03:10.340 --> 01:03:11.900
Yeah.

01:03:11.900 --> 01:03:12.860
The little rat.

01:03:13.900 --> 01:03:15.500
The electricity rat.

01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:16.580
Lightning rat, yeah.

01:03:16.580 --> 01:03:18.060
Yeah.

01:03:18.060 --> 01:03:30.300
And fucking Pikachu fucking asks.

01:03:30.300 --> 01:03:31.140
Hello?

01:03:37.820 --> 01:03:39.020
Hello?

01:03:39.020 --> 01:03:41.260
I am just wondering.

01:03:41.260 --> 01:03:48.100
Hey guys, quick question.

01:03:48.100 --> 01:03:48.940
Go ahead.

01:03:51.460 --> 01:03:52.460
Hey guys, quick question.

01:03:52.460 --> 01:03:53.820
It's me and Pikachu.

01:03:53.820 --> 01:04:02.620
I got yelled at when I vaped on an airplane.

01:04:02.620 --> 01:04:08.460
And I'm just wondering how to move on.

01:04:08.460 --> 01:04:14.380
My name is Justin McElroy.

01:04:14.380 --> 01:04:15.660
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:04:15.660 --> 01:04:16.740
That was an okay one.

01:04:16.740 --> 01:04:17.580
I'm Griffin McElroy.

01:04:17.580 --> 01:04:19.020
I can do better than that.

01:04:19.020 --> 01:04:20.540
This has been my brother, my brother, me,

01:04:20.540 --> 01:04:40.500
because your dad's screw on the lips.

01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:55.260
