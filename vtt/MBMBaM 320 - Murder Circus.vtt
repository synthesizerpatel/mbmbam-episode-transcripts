00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.640 --> 00:45.760
Hello everybody and welcome. My brother, my brother,

00:45.760 --> 00:49.200
mean advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

00:49.200 --> 00:52.800
I'm your middle brother, Travis McElroy. I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

00:52.800 --> 00:58.000
I hate this so much. It's not good to see your meat.

00:58.000 --> 01:01.200
I don't like it. You guys are going to be able to see me. We're recording in the same

01:01.200 --> 01:04.720
room for the first time since we got together and when we weren't like live on stage.

01:04.720 --> 01:08.000
Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's true. And I don't want you guys to be able to see me because then

01:08.000 --> 01:11.120
you'll see when I zone out and stop listening to you so I can come up with jokes.

01:11.920 --> 01:15.360
It's basically literally as soon as you finish. There you go. Bye, Travis.

01:16.160 --> 01:21.920
There he goes. So we are recording in my home here in beautiful Hinton, West Virginia,

01:21.920 --> 01:29.040
because we're about to start production on our new TV show. We're done with our old TV show.

01:29.040 --> 01:32.640
It's time for the new one. Yeah, maybe you've heard of it. Frasier.

01:34.080 --> 01:39.680
Griffin, you said Frasier wrong. No, it wasn't Frasier. It was Frasier. So that was F-R-A-Y.

01:41.520 --> 01:46.080
You know how that one company made like Atlantic Grim and that kind of stuff so that grandparents

01:46.080 --> 01:49.680
would just scroll through and buy it. That's what we want. We wanted kids to scroll through and buy

01:49.680 --> 01:55.120
Frasier for their grandparents. It was dark Frasier. This is very dark.

01:55.120 --> 01:58.080
But anyway, that's over with now because now we're making My Brother, My Brother and Me

01:58.640 --> 02:01.680
Untitled Project. It's not Untitled. I think it's just going to be called-

02:02.880 --> 02:07.440
It's just called The Kelsey Grammer Show. So now we've gone Hollywood and-

02:07.440 --> 02:09.600
A lot of stuff has changed. A lot of stuff has changed.

02:09.600 --> 02:11.760
How has your life changed, Justin, since we went to Hollywood?

02:11.760 --> 02:15.840
Well, I don't have very bad diarrhea. You know what? Me neither. Now Griffin-

02:15.840 --> 02:19.920
That's weird how that happened because I strangely, as soon as I made the switch to go

02:19.920 --> 02:26.560
Hollywood, my body was like, you've gone corpo. Anyway, I've got the norovirus and it's a fun

02:26.560 --> 02:33.680
way to start out the shoot. If you watch the show early next year and you see Griffin, you say, boy,

02:33.680 --> 02:39.760
that boy look empty. There's a good reason. It's actually a fact that one in three people

02:39.760 --> 02:44.800
who could go Hollywood have wicked bad diarrhea. If you've ever seen Ocean's Eleven, one in three

02:44.800 --> 02:48.480
of them was having wicked bad diarrhea. I can't run the math on that, but it's a good number.

02:48.480 --> 02:50.320
Three to four of the- Let's see.

02:50.320 --> 02:51.440
Three and three quarters.

02:51.440 --> 02:52.000
Let's think.

02:53.040 --> 02:54.400
That math's no fun.

02:54.400 --> 02:56.320
Clooney definitely had it.

02:56.320 --> 02:57.280
Uh-huh. Cheeto.

02:57.920 --> 03:01.120
Don Cheadle has it all the time.

03:01.120 --> 03:05.360
There's all the time. Don Cheadle's body is actually allergic to fame, but he can't stop.

03:05.360 --> 03:09.840
He's got a slender profile and it's because of that noro, that Hollywood noro.

03:09.840 --> 03:14.000
We scheduled a few days early for everybody to get in and get in the-

03:14.000 --> 03:19.200
Get in a rhythm. Just get comfortable with each other again, relearn each other's bodies,

03:19.200 --> 03:23.840
each other's rhythms. Griffin has spent the entire time on the couch in my den,

03:23.840 --> 03:26.480
watching the OC and playing Phoenix Wright on CBS.

03:26.480 --> 03:27.360
And just fucking-

03:27.360 --> 03:28.320
Just fucking-

03:28.320 --> 03:29.360
Just driving.

03:30.000 --> 03:30.720
Yeah.

03:30.720 --> 03:33.200
It's been a miserable, miserable weekend.

03:34.400 --> 03:36.080
Excited to get fucking started though.

03:36.080 --> 03:36.800
Just so ready.

03:36.800 --> 03:41.680
Making the red carpet. Making the red carpet right there, laying it down and stepping on it.

03:41.680 --> 03:44.560
Walking all over the red carpet.

03:44.560 --> 03:44.800
Yeah.

03:46.400 --> 03:47.520
Thanks for listening.

03:47.520 --> 03:48.000
I don't know.

03:48.640 --> 03:50.160
Are these going to be regular?

03:50.160 --> 03:51.680
What's going to be different about these?

03:51.680 --> 03:54.480
Because we're going to have three of these episodes where we're doing it all together.

03:54.480 --> 03:56.800
They're going to be shorter because we got nothing in the tank.

03:56.800 --> 03:57.760
We have not-

03:57.760 --> 04:00.880
I especially look at my belly.

04:00.880 --> 04:01.680
Do you see that?

04:01.680 --> 04:04.320
How it says there's a needle pointing to E?

04:04.320 --> 04:08.720
I have nothing inside to power my goofs anymore.

04:08.720 --> 04:11.680
He's clinging to an action figure of our dad for strength.

04:11.680 --> 04:12.240
Thank you, dad.

04:13.360 --> 04:15.280
Should we get started and just do some advice?

04:15.280 --> 04:15.920
Yeah, that sounds-

04:15.920 --> 04:17.200
Can we holler at Rob?

04:17.200 --> 04:18.720
Rob is editing the show for us.

04:18.720 --> 04:20.720
It's the first time we've ever had anybody, not me.

04:21.600 --> 04:24.080
Well, I guess you guys have edited every once in a while.

04:24.080 --> 04:26.160
I did a really shitty job twice, I think.

04:26.160 --> 04:27.200
But Rob is going to do a great job.

04:27.200 --> 04:29.520
Do you think Rob's going to put in any fun sound effects?

04:30.480 --> 04:31.280
Let's listen in.

04:33.520 --> 04:34.480
That's really good, Rob.

04:35.200 --> 04:36.720
We're going to call you great job, Rob.

04:36.720 --> 04:37.360
Very funny.

04:37.360 --> 04:38.400
Great job, Rob.

04:38.400 --> 04:40.720
So listen, I hate this.

04:42.400 --> 04:44.960
I cannot stress enough how distracting it is to see

04:44.960 --> 04:47.040
your stupid faces in the same room with me.

04:48.000 --> 04:48.560
It's weird.

04:48.560 --> 04:50.560
It's like trying to shit in public.

04:50.560 --> 04:53.680
Griffin, do you know anything about that?

04:53.680 --> 04:55.120
She like shitting in public?

04:55.680 --> 04:57.200
He's not that diuretic.

04:57.200 --> 05:00.240
He's not just like, could everyone please look to their left?

05:00.240 --> 05:01.520
I don't like how blue this is.

05:01.520 --> 05:02.400
It's very blue.

05:02.400 --> 05:03.200
Okay, here's a question.

05:03.840 --> 05:06.960
A woman I went to university with works at my local Starbucks.

05:06.960 --> 05:09.760
It's called college, get it right or pay the price.

05:09.760 --> 05:10.400
We knew each other.

05:10.400 --> 05:11.760
Starbucks is called college?

05:11.760 --> 05:13.360
Yeah, it's called coffee college.

05:13.360 --> 05:14.320
I went to Starbucks, you.

05:15.360 --> 05:16.720
I majored in foam.

05:16.720 --> 05:17.760
I have a latte debt.

05:19.680 --> 05:20.880
Shut up, that wasn't even good.

05:20.880 --> 05:21.840
That was good.

05:21.840 --> 05:22.480
Yeah.

05:22.480 --> 05:24.320
Now you're ready to really start making the beans.

05:24.880 --> 05:27.600
A woman I went to university with works at my local Starbucks.

05:27.600 --> 05:29.760
We knew each other and I would happily say hello to her

05:29.760 --> 05:32.560
and reintroduce myself, except for one problem.

05:32.560 --> 05:34.240
She had an identical twin.

05:34.240 --> 05:35.840
Bum, bum, bum.

05:35.840 --> 05:38.320
And I'm not sure which twin it is.

05:38.880 --> 05:40.160
Do I have to move now?

05:41.040 --> 05:41.360
This is.

05:42.240 --> 05:43.520
That's from Confused Coffee Trigger.

05:43.520 --> 05:47.840
Listen guys, you don't have to jump straight to moving away every time.

05:47.840 --> 05:49.120
Yeah, I lost my keys.

05:49.120 --> 05:51.120
Do I need to move away?

05:51.120 --> 05:52.000
Good luck with that.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.200
Yeah, you don't need to move.

05:53.200 --> 05:53.920
No, you're fine.

05:53.920 --> 05:56.720
At the very least, there's probably other coffee shops in your area.

05:57.360 --> 06:01.600
Unless the identical twin works at the other coffee shop in your area.

06:01.600 --> 06:02.480
Oh no.

06:02.480 --> 06:07.120
Better coffee shops with less corporate greed, probably.

06:07.120 --> 06:07.840
Wait, hold on.

06:07.840 --> 06:08.960
How do we feel about Starbucks?

06:09.840 --> 06:10.560
Where are we at?

06:10.560 --> 06:12.400
I have the easiest solution to this.

06:12.400 --> 06:13.360
She works at Starbucks.

06:13.360 --> 06:14.480
She's wearing a name tag.

06:15.200 --> 06:16.240
I have the same name though.

06:16.240 --> 06:17.120
It's the fucked up thing.

06:17.120 --> 06:17.920
Oh no.

06:17.920 --> 06:18.400
Yeah.

06:18.400 --> 06:19.840
But spelled slightly differently?

06:19.840 --> 06:20.640
No.

06:20.640 --> 06:21.680
Spelled the exact same?

06:21.680 --> 06:22.160
Exactly the same.

06:22.160 --> 06:23.360
We're both Joanie.

06:23.360 --> 06:27.200
We probably saved a lot on personalized license plates and key chains and stuff.

06:27.200 --> 06:30.480
And as a responsible parent, you gotta think about stuff like that.

06:30.480 --> 06:33.600
That license plates cost so much money.

06:33.600 --> 06:36.480
You think they just get printed at prisons?

06:36.480 --> 06:39.040
Yeah, that's why we're naming our daughter Hamilton.

06:39.040 --> 06:41.280
She'll be able to find stuff everywhere.

06:41.280 --> 06:46.640
It's a good thing that you are so concerned about this because I'm certain this is the

06:46.640 --> 06:49.040
first time she's ever had any issue.

06:49.680 --> 06:51.040
It's good that you are personally-

06:51.040 --> 06:52.000
No, I'm Julie.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.240
Oh, did you confu- No way!

06:54.240 --> 06:56.720
We're two different people, you monster.

06:56.720 --> 06:57.920
How could you, Darren?

06:57.920 --> 06:59.040
How could you, Darren?

06:59.040 --> 07:00.560
No, it's not me.

07:00.560 --> 07:02.560
It's my identical brother, Barron.

07:03.920 --> 07:05.920
That's a good reversal if that happens.

07:05.920 --> 07:06.560
How could you?

07:07.360 --> 07:12.400
This is so not- Also, man, I've had two hour long conversations with people in which I

07:12.400 --> 07:14.080
did not use their name once.

07:14.080 --> 07:17.280
It's gonna be super cool to like, hey, how's it going?

07:17.280 --> 07:19.200
I won't tell Dale Carnegie you said that.

07:19.200 --> 07:19.600
Thank you.

07:19.600 --> 07:21.040
No, I'm not a good person.

07:21.040 --> 07:22.480
I don't wanna share the problem.

07:22.480 --> 07:24.880
It's just, do both twins work at the Starbucks?

07:24.880 --> 07:26.240
No, I don't think so.

07:26.240 --> 07:30.640
It's just that you don't know, you've never known, you've never ever known which twin

07:30.640 --> 07:32.640
this has been the whole time.

07:32.640 --> 07:33.520
Wait, I've got it.

07:33.520 --> 07:33.840
Okay.

07:34.480 --> 07:37.760
You do like a fun, like, college buddy thing, use their last name.

07:38.800 --> 07:41.520
You just walk up and you're like, Johnson, what's up?

07:41.520 --> 07:42.000
Right?

07:42.000 --> 07:45.120
Because like, you're going to be right 100% of the time.

07:45.120 --> 07:51.040
Okay, but Travis, this person has been to this Starbucks a few times, enough times

07:51.040 --> 07:52.560
that they're writing in to us about it.

07:52.560 --> 07:57.600
This is, how fucking weird is it that after acting like a stranger for weeks, suddenly

07:57.600 --> 08:01.200
they're like, hey, Johnson, do you remember me, Johnson?

08:01.200 --> 08:02.320
No, you just gotta put a question.

08:02.320 --> 08:04.400
You can't do it like a challenge, like how did you not remember?

08:04.400 --> 08:06.160
Do you like a question and you go, Johnson?

08:06.160 --> 08:07.600
Oh my God, are you aging backwards?

08:07.600 --> 08:09.040
I never would have believed we went to college together.

08:09.040 --> 08:09.840
You look great.

08:09.840 --> 08:10.640
Something like that.

08:10.640 --> 08:15.040
You know what else would work, you say, you know what would be fun this time is you write

08:15.040 --> 08:19.440
your own name on the coffee cup, but then they write like a diaper and it's like, why

08:19.440 --> 08:21.600
did you write, it's all we know.

08:21.600 --> 08:26.000
It's like a twist on that, I lost my phone number, can I have yours kind of thing.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.840
Except you're like, I lost my name.

08:27.840 --> 08:29.680
I lost my identity, can I have yours?

08:29.680 --> 08:31.280
A coffee buyer has no name.

08:31.280 --> 08:35.200
This says Shusen, Shusen, is that, okay.

08:36.560 --> 08:37.680
How about a Yahoo?

08:37.680 --> 08:38.000
Yeah.

08:38.000 --> 08:38.240
Yeah.

08:39.600 --> 08:41.680
This one was sent in by level 9,000.

08:41.680 --> 08:46.560
Yadu, yadu, yadu, yadu, yadu, yadu, yadu, yadu, yadu, yadu, yadu, yadu, yadu, yadu.

08:46.560 --> 08:47.520
Is asked by Yadu.

08:47.520 --> 08:50.560
Hey, Rob, could you just insert ground saying Drew down?

08:50.560 --> 08:52.400
Could you fix it, but don't really, leave that in.

08:52.400 --> 08:53.920
It's from Yadu answers user.

08:55.120 --> 08:56.640
Well, they're not listed.

08:56.640 --> 09:01.120
So I'm going to go with the next name down, which is death dealer.

09:03.360 --> 09:06.800
Death dealer asks, I think magicians are hot.

09:07.760 --> 09:09.600
I can't afford to go to circuses.

09:11.120 --> 09:14.880
Is there any other places that magicians hang out or I could meet them?

09:14.880 --> 09:15.840
Nope, just there.

09:15.840 --> 09:17.200
Just there for circuses.

09:17.200 --> 09:18.080
Dammit.

09:18.080 --> 09:18.580
Dam.

09:18.580 --> 09:21.540
What, what venue?

09:22.500 --> 09:22.820
Okay.

09:22.820 --> 09:24.500
I haven't been to a circus in a grip.

09:24.500 --> 09:26.580
I don't know how much a circus, how much is a circus?

09:26.580 --> 09:27.460
Justin, you've got kid.

09:27.460 --> 09:28.820
How much is a circus?

09:28.820 --> 09:31.460
1750 usually 18 bucks.

09:31.460 --> 09:31.780
Okay.

09:31.780 --> 09:36.820
Because there's not going to be a Vegas show cheaper than going to like a Ringling Brothers

09:36.820 --> 09:37.540
circus.

09:37.540 --> 09:37.780
Yeah.

09:37.780 --> 09:41.140
I mean, it's like, or like even a bad circuit, a worse circus than that.

09:41.140 --> 09:42.740
There are many off brand.

09:42.740 --> 09:47.460
You can go to like uncle Jimmy's like cut rate circus where there's like golden retrievers

09:47.460 --> 09:51.540
in mains and like the magician guy is just like making your money disappear.

09:51.540 --> 09:52.980
And all the clowns are babies.

09:53.620 --> 09:54.260
Well, hold on.

09:54.260 --> 09:55.300
You charge extra for that.

09:55.300 --> 09:56.420
You want a clown baby?

09:56.420 --> 09:58.260
I don't want to go to this circus now.

09:58.260 --> 09:59.540
It's a pretty good circus actually.

09:59.540 --> 10:03.060
Now that I've been describing it, this would be a really like easy entry point for kids

10:03.060 --> 10:05.780
who like are afraid of the circus or like, no, it's just a dog in a wig.

10:05.780 --> 10:07.220
And you're like, okay, this is all right.

10:07.220 --> 10:08.900
Well, you got to build to that.

10:08.900 --> 10:10.420
If you want to start, you're in circus.

10:10.420 --> 10:12.580
Nobody's going to give you an elephant day one.

10:12.580 --> 10:14.900
You got to start with like, what do I have around me?

10:14.900 --> 10:15.300
Okay.

10:15.300 --> 10:16.420
I have dogs.

10:16.420 --> 10:17.460
I have babies.

10:17.460 --> 10:18.500
I have mains.

10:18.500 --> 10:20.420
You got, I can put a main on the baby.

10:20.420 --> 10:21.220
No, that's not right.

10:21.220 --> 10:21.860
I'll get there.

10:21.860 --> 10:22.820
That's a good point, Justin.

10:22.820 --> 10:28.100
Cause you can't just like say I have a circus now and expect people to like give you lions.

10:28.100 --> 10:30.020
You got to prove you're responsible for lions.

10:30.020 --> 10:31.300
How do you start?

10:31.300 --> 10:33.220
How do you get your first elephant?

10:33.220 --> 10:36.580
Cause it seems like people, first off, I guess elephants aren't in it anymore.

10:36.580 --> 10:38.100
No, elephants are all retired.

10:38.100 --> 10:38.660
Thanks, Obama.

10:40.580 --> 10:43.460
They've all returned to their native home of Nebraska.

10:43.460 --> 10:48.420
This is what the book Water for Elephants was about, is about a young circus man.

10:48.420 --> 10:50.740
He falls deeply in love and he has to take care of elephants.

10:50.740 --> 10:52.020
It's like, you better give them water.

10:52.020 --> 10:53.140
They love that stuff, man.

10:53.140 --> 10:54.980
Elephants, they're crazy about this stuff.

10:54.980 --> 10:56.420
They will die without water.

10:56.420 --> 10:58.020
That much I know about these elephants.

10:58.020 --> 11:00.020
That's Elephant 101.

11:00.020 --> 11:03.860
Oh, you get a Timothy Elephant and then he comes and you can prove you're responsible

11:03.860 --> 11:04.340
for him.

11:04.340 --> 11:04.980
And then they give you more.

11:04.980 --> 11:06.900
That's what the book Water for Elephants.

11:06.900 --> 11:09.380
You got to, you got to drop factor.

11:09.380 --> 11:12.900
You got to drop like facts about your knowledge of elephants.

11:12.900 --> 11:18.020
Like, hello, I'd like to buy an elephant which need water to live for my circus.

11:18.020 --> 11:19.540
That was the test and you passed.

11:19.540 --> 11:20.660
Here you go, young man.

11:21.300 --> 11:22.820
What is this part called?

11:22.820 --> 11:23.380
The trunk.

11:23.380 --> 11:24.100
That's right.

11:24.100 --> 11:24.660
You did great.

11:24.660 --> 11:25.300
You did great.

11:25.300 --> 11:26.580
And what do they need to live?

11:26.580 --> 11:26.900
Water.

11:26.900 --> 11:27.780
That's also right.

11:27.780 --> 11:28.740
Here you go.

11:28.740 --> 11:30.100
Hey, you're not going to hurt it.

11:30.100 --> 11:30.820
No hurting.

11:30.820 --> 11:31.380
All right.

11:31.380 --> 11:31.780
All right.

11:31.780 --> 11:33.060
Enjoy your circus.

11:33.060 --> 11:36.820
I think that to take over a circus, you have to first apprentice with like a ring master

11:36.820 --> 11:38.820
because you can't just say like, I'm a master now.

11:38.820 --> 11:43.380
You got to start as like a ring apprentice and then eventually kill the ring master.

11:43.380 --> 11:46.020
Take his big hat and whip maybe and hoop.

11:46.020 --> 11:47.460
And now you're the ring master.

11:47.460 --> 11:49.540
Well, you have to make it look like an accident.

11:49.540 --> 11:50.100
Oh yeah.

11:50.100 --> 11:52.180
He's got to get, I see.

11:52.180 --> 11:54.100
What's a good circus accident?

11:54.100 --> 11:54.980
Jesus, Travis.

11:54.980 --> 11:59.220
I mean, circuses were literally made for murders that look like accidents.

11:59.220 --> 12:02.580
Yeah, but like you don't want to fall into the one of like, oh, he got crushed by cotton

12:02.580 --> 12:03.140
candy.

12:03.140 --> 12:04.180
No, he didn't.

12:04.180 --> 12:08.580
Barnum and Bailey were like, we need to murder a bunch of fools and make it look like accidents.

12:08.580 --> 12:11.780
How can we create the most dangerous environment possible?

12:11.780 --> 12:13.220
I know we're going to get lions.

12:13.220 --> 12:15.700
We're going to put motherfuckers heads in the lions.

12:15.700 --> 12:16.500
What's up?

12:16.500 --> 12:20.740
We're going to make people walk on like really thin wires, super duper high up.

12:20.740 --> 12:22.500
Well, we got to make sure they won't be missed.

12:22.500 --> 12:24.260
Well, we'll just travel around all the time.

12:24.260 --> 12:25.380
No one will think to look for.

12:25.380 --> 12:26.980
We'll give them fake names and shit.

12:26.980 --> 12:27.940
We'll paint their faces.

12:27.940 --> 12:29.700
No one will even know what they look like.

12:29.700 --> 12:30.100
This is it.

12:30.100 --> 12:30.740
Wait, hold on.

12:30.740 --> 12:31.060
Wait.

12:31.060 --> 12:33.380
This is a real, we're explaining a lot here.

12:33.380 --> 12:34.900
It makes a lot more sense to me now.

12:34.900 --> 12:36.180
It's the perfect murder.

12:36.180 --> 12:37.460
Circus murder is the perfect murder.

12:37.460 --> 12:39.220
Circus murder.

12:39.220 --> 12:41.300
Here are some other ways you could kill somebody in a circus.

12:41.300 --> 12:42.020
Okay, please.

12:42.020 --> 12:43.060
Poison cotton candy.

12:43.060 --> 12:43.780
Yes.

12:43.780 --> 12:44.260
That's it.

12:44.260 --> 12:45.140
That one's easy.

12:45.940 --> 12:47.060
Poison hot dogs.

12:47.060 --> 12:47.620
Two.

12:47.620 --> 12:48.020
Okay.

12:48.020 --> 12:50.420
Make, don't give an elephant water for a really long time.

12:50.420 --> 12:54.260
Then have them walk into the elephant zone with a bottle of water and the elephant will

12:54.260 --> 12:56.500
just go fucking ham on them.

12:57.220 --> 12:58.500
Rub peanuts on their clothes.

12:58.500 --> 12:59.540
Is that water?

13:01.540 --> 13:01.940
Oh, wait.

13:01.940 --> 13:05.060
If you, if you dehydrated an elephant, it could talk.

13:05.060 --> 13:05.780
Yeah.

13:05.780 --> 13:06.740
They get thirsty enough.

13:06.740 --> 13:11.860
Offer like an amateur sword swallower booth because, well, that's a little on the nose,

13:11.860 --> 13:12.260
isn't it?

13:12.260 --> 13:13.380
Try sword swallowing.

13:14.500 --> 13:15.700
You've heard so much about it.

13:15.700 --> 13:16.980
Oh, you think it's so easy?

13:16.980 --> 13:17.140
Yeah.

13:17.140 --> 13:21.060
Then you, oh, get a very standoffish sword swallower to join your circus.

13:21.060 --> 13:23.860
Well, then you do it and then like that just takes care of itself.

13:23.860 --> 13:25.140
You've read about it in my book.

13:25.140 --> 13:26.500
You've seen it on Travel Channel.

13:26.500 --> 13:29.620
Now is your chance to experience sword swallowing for yourself.

13:29.620 --> 13:33.380
You think when Cirque du Soleil got up in it, they're like, here's my idea for a circus.

13:33.380 --> 13:34.500
Two, two steps.

13:34.500 --> 13:36.340
One, weirdly sexual.

13:36.340 --> 13:39.540
Two, let's take the murder out of the equation.

13:39.540 --> 13:45.140
That's the only reason that Cirque du Soleil is so popular is cause the audience don't

13:45.140 --> 13:47.220
get the same murder vibes they get from the circus.

13:47.220 --> 13:47.540
Yeah.

13:47.540 --> 13:53.460
It's, do you think that this idea was sort of the impetus for Spider-Man turning off

13:53.460 --> 13:54.260
the dark?

13:54.260 --> 13:54.500
Yeah.

13:54.500 --> 13:56.020
We miss all the murder.

13:56.020 --> 13:56.820
Where's the murder?

13:56.820 --> 13:57.620
Where's the murder?

13:57.620 --> 14:00.580
The old circus days, old vaudeville days.

14:00.580 --> 14:01.700
Bring it back, you two.

14:02.820 --> 14:03.220
Okay.

14:03.220 --> 14:04.500
We'll, we'll both bring it back.

14:04.500 --> 14:05.380
You got, okay.

14:05.380 --> 14:06.420
Sorry we took it.

14:06.420 --> 14:07.140
Done.

14:07.140 --> 14:08.260
How about a question, Justin?

14:08.260 --> 14:08.420
Yeah.

14:08.420 --> 14:09.380
I got one for you.

14:09.380 --> 14:10.740
And please stop looking at me.

14:10.740 --> 14:11.780
I really just can't.

14:12.500 --> 14:14.740
My office buys food for lunchtime meetings.

14:14.740 --> 14:17.860
After the meeting is over, the food is placed in the break room.

14:17.860 --> 14:21.860
I learned from our receptionist that she throws away any food at the end of the day if anything

14:21.860 --> 14:22.740
is left.

14:22.740 --> 14:25.300
Sometimes there are containers full of food left.

14:25.300 --> 14:29.780
I have decided that rather than let the food go to waste, I would bring containers on the

14:29.780 --> 14:34.580
days that food would be available and try to bring it home in my good.

14:34.580 --> 14:38.500
That's from not quite dumpster diving in Fishers, Indiana.

14:38.500 --> 14:40.020
I love this blackhawk down.

14:40.740 --> 14:44.820
Leave no ma'am, leave no, leave no delicious taquitos behind.

14:44.820 --> 14:46.740
It all depends on your timing.

14:46.740 --> 14:47.300
Okay.

14:47.300 --> 14:52.020
Because like, if you're, if they serve the food at like 1215 and they ordered a bunch

14:52.020 --> 14:55.620
of pizzas for lunch and you go through with a plate and a Tupperware and you're like,

14:55.620 --> 14:56.660
you're not going to eat all this.

14:56.660 --> 14:57.700
I'm taking it with me.

14:57.700 --> 14:58.260
You're a jerk.

14:58.260 --> 14:59.940
Yeah, Travis, that's food theft.

14:59.940 --> 15:04.980
But if you wait until like 459 and you just barely beat the receptionist to like the thing

15:04.980 --> 15:07.140
and save the pizza, you're a hero.

15:07.140 --> 15:12.100
If you drive your Ford Focus into the front window of the Papa John's and then jump out

15:12.100 --> 15:15.780
and steal all the pizzas before it's even delivered to your office, then yeah, that's

15:15.780 --> 15:16.180
not acceptable.

15:16.180 --> 15:20.180
I'm just saying there's a thin line between like a pizza theft and a pizza hero.

15:20.180 --> 15:20.740
You know what I mean?

15:20.740 --> 15:22.180
And it's about four hours.

15:22.180 --> 15:24.020
There is a good point there of like-

15:24.020 --> 15:24.580
Is there?

15:24.580 --> 15:25.060
Extra pizza.

15:25.060 --> 15:25.700
You found it?

15:25.700 --> 15:26.900
No, there is one.

15:26.900 --> 15:31.540
If you have extra pizzas, okay, somebody brings in a stack of pizzas from Papa John's, right?

15:31.540 --> 15:33.140
They're all piping hot and fresh as every-

15:33.140 --> 15:33.700
They're delicious.

15:33.700 --> 15:34.260
They're amazing.

15:34.260 --> 15:35.140
They're delicious.

15:35.140 --> 15:38.100
You can get that thin crust, you can get a little bit of sprinkles on it, it's so good.

15:38.100 --> 15:41.380
If somebody walks in as soon as the doors are open and they're like, this one's going

15:41.380 --> 15:43.780
home with me, that's a monstrous thing to do.

15:44.580 --> 15:49.300
At some point during the day, it becomes okay for them to be like, I'm taking one of these

15:49.300 --> 15:50.740
and everyone will be like, oh, thank God.

15:50.740 --> 15:51.700
What is that point?

15:51.700 --> 15:55.140
I think it's when everybody's full of pizza because when you're full of pizza, there's

15:55.140 --> 15:57.540
nothing more deplorable to you than pizza.

15:57.540 --> 16:01.060
You just have to go cubicle by cubicle like, Dan, you full?

16:01.060 --> 16:02.260
Susan, you full?

16:02.260 --> 16:02.980
Yeah, and actually-

16:02.980 --> 16:03.940
You want some more?

16:03.940 --> 16:04.420
What kind?

16:04.420 --> 16:05.060
I will get it for you.

16:05.060 --> 16:06.100
I got to expedite this process.

16:06.100 --> 16:09.780
Have you ever been so full of pizza that you watch someone else eat pizza and you're like,

16:09.780 --> 16:11.140
what are you doing?

16:11.140 --> 16:12.020
That's disgusting.

16:12.020 --> 16:13.140
You're the devil.

16:13.700 --> 16:18.740
Also, no tea, no shade, but at the end of this question, I thought it was going to end

16:18.740 --> 16:24.340
with, I would bring containers to some sort of hunger thing or shelter place.

16:24.340 --> 16:30.260
Yeah, one of the things that hunger places prize the most is if I can say a last pizza

16:30.260 --> 16:32.100
at a Tupperware, you brought for work.

16:32.100 --> 16:32.980
Oh, thank you.

16:32.980 --> 16:37.780
This will feed no one that's returning it in the trash.

16:40.020 --> 16:40.900
That was a good zone out.

16:40.900 --> 16:42.500
I just caught a really juicy one.

16:42.500 --> 16:43.380
Is that 30 seconds?

16:43.380 --> 16:44.820
Because I think I've come up with a solution.

16:44.820 --> 16:47.940
What you need to do is you need to organize with whoever the office manager is who takes

16:47.940 --> 16:52.580
care of food and you need to take however much is left at the end of the day and then

16:52.580 --> 16:55.940
minus that much from the next time they order food.

16:55.940 --> 17:00.100
Because what appears to be happening here is your supply and demand is way off.

17:00.100 --> 17:04.820
You need to get the supply lower so the demand is higher or else you're just wasting food.

17:04.820 --> 17:11.140
And not only wasting food, but you could create a game here where you know if there's 100

17:11.140 --> 17:13.780
people in your office, there's only food for 99.

17:13.780 --> 17:18.820
So who's going to be the 100th and that 100th just doesn't get food on that Friday.

17:18.820 --> 17:22.660
That's fun because then you can also have an office pool and whoever loses the office

17:22.660 --> 17:25.140
pool has to get the food the next time.

17:25.140 --> 17:30.420
I'm broken I think in a way because there's nothing less appetizing to me and I don't

17:30.420 --> 17:36.420
know if maybe I'm alone in this, but like anytime food is provided on like a table and

17:36.420 --> 17:40.340
everybody's waiting in line to eat it, that's profoundly unappetizing to me.

17:40.340 --> 17:44.740
I never want to eat in that scenario and I think partially it's because I'm overweight

17:44.740 --> 17:49.460
and I feel like it's such a bad look to be like, I can't even wait for this.

17:49.460 --> 17:54.980
And I feel like I'm always the person when dinner is available, they always say,

17:54.980 --> 17:55.940
somebody get us started off.

17:55.940 --> 17:56.900
Griffin, come on.

17:56.900 --> 18:03.940
And I always wonder why I'm the hunky boy that has to fire the starting pistol.

18:03.940 --> 18:08.020
I think the thing that trips me up about it is if you're in line for food, what you're

18:08.020 --> 18:12.100
saying is, I'm really worried there's not going to be enough for everybody and I want

18:12.100 --> 18:13.300
to get my taste.

18:13.300 --> 18:17.300
And especially if you're the first one in line, it looks like you're like with your

18:17.300 --> 18:20.100
body language saying, stay back, stay back.

18:20.100 --> 18:21.300
These potatoes are mine.

18:21.300 --> 18:23.300
You know I'm the hunky boy.

18:23.300 --> 18:24.740
What are you even doing?

18:24.740 --> 18:27.780
Then, but of course, see that bites me in the ass sometimes because we were at Max Fun

18:27.780 --> 18:32.420
Con East last weekend and there was some, I went up to get, I waited a little bit too

18:32.420 --> 18:37.940
long and then I went up and there was a thing of three cheese tortellini in the thing and

18:37.940 --> 18:39.700
I missed out and there wasn't any in there.

18:39.700 --> 18:40.180
That's okay.

18:40.180 --> 18:43.780
There's plenty of other food for the rest of the fucking weekend.

18:43.780 --> 18:47.220
All anybody wanted to talk about was this three cheese tortellini.

18:47.220 --> 18:48.180
It was really good.

18:48.820 --> 18:49.380
Get in there.

18:49.380 --> 18:49.860
Get in there.

18:49.860 --> 18:51.300
I missed out.

18:51.300 --> 18:55.700
I just love how much we're talking about that good, good food.

18:55.700 --> 18:55.940
Okay.

18:55.940 --> 18:56.660
Here's the problem.

18:57.220 --> 18:58.580
Here's the problem question, Oscar.

18:58.580 --> 18:59.940
I've just realized the issue here.

19:00.580 --> 19:07.300
How many times can you do this in a row before you gain the reputation as the one who takes

19:07.300 --> 19:08.980
food home every time?

19:08.980 --> 19:13.620
Well, because you'll start to hear these jokes at 1215 when the pizza gets there, like, oh,

19:13.620 --> 19:14.980
make sure you leave some for Stan.

19:14.980 --> 19:16.020
Am I right, Stan?

19:16.020 --> 19:18.980
And you guys think like, I just told him, he feeds it to his weird birds.

19:20.820 --> 19:23.060
I told you guys, I don't have birds.

19:23.060 --> 19:25.300
I don't have birds and the pizza just gets thrown away.

19:25.300 --> 19:25.780
Oh yeah.

19:25.780 --> 19:26.740
You love trash pizza.

19:27.540 --> 19:29.700
It's a very angry workplace.

19:29.700 --> 19:32.020
It's for my ferret named Stan's bird.

19:32.660 --> 19:34.420
Stan's bird loves pizza.

19:34.420 --> 19:36.980
My ferret Stan's bird loves pizza.

19:36.980 --> 19:38.820
Um, as long as we're talking-

19:38.820 --> 19:40.660
Where are people even getting ferrets?

19:42.180 --> 19:42.980
Hold on.

19:42.980 --> 19:44.180
We've spiraled.

19:44.180 --> 19:45.060
Yeah, we've spiraled.

19:45.060 --> 19:48.340
Can I read a Yahoo that's like maybe the best transition we've ever had on this show?

19:48.340 --> 19:48.900
Hell yeah.

19:49.780 --> 19:51.140
Sent in by Aaron Keys.

19:52.020 --> 19:53.300
We're going to come up with that nickname.

19:53.300 --> 19:54.180
The Keys Blade.

19:55.460 --> 19:56.340
Jesus.

19:56.340 --> 19:57.540
It's from Yahoo Answers user.

19:57.540 --> 19:58.340
Keysman.

19:58.340 --> 19:59.380
Calvster.

20:00.180 --> 20:01.140
Just let him get through it.

20:01.140 --> 20:02.260
Look at how weak he is.

20:02.260 --> 20:02.580
Keysgate.

20:02.580 --> 20:04.260
I really, all my bones are gone.

20:04.260 --> 20:08.740
It's from Yahoo Answers user Calvster who says, who asks,

20:10.100 --> 20:15.220
would you eat a bag of bread rolls that have been mysteriously left at your doorstep?

20:15.940 --> 20:16.900
What?

20:16.900 --> 20:17.460
What?

20:17.460 --> 20:19.380
It's a really good transition.

20:19.380 --> 20:20.020
Wait a minute.

20:20.020 --> 20:23.060
Would you eat a bag of bread rolls that have been mysteriously left at your doorstep?

20:23.060 --> 20:24.180
Let's put some parameters on this.

20:24.180 --> 20:25.540
You got home at five.

20:25.540 --> 20:26.260
Five thirty.

20:27.860 --> 20:28.420
Who is it?

20:28.420 --> 20:29.300
Nobody's-

20:29.300 --> 20:32.260
Who left this bag of bread rolls on my doorstep?

20:32.260 --> 20:35.300
With a note saying, I can't care for these bread rolls.

20:35.300 --> 20:36.900
Please, please adopt these bread rolls.

20:36.900 --> 20:37.700
I made too many.

20:37.700 --> 20:38.900
Sincerely, a neighbor.

20:39.700 --> 20:42.580
A bag of bread rolls that have been mysteriously left at your doorstep.

20:42.580 --> 20:45.460
You know, my biggest worry would be the first thing I would think was,

20:45.460 --> 20:48.020
what, what am I putting out in the world?

20:48.020 --> 20:50.740
Like what, maybe you'll see me day to day, but they think,

20:50.740 --> 20:52.580
I need to get that man some rolls.

20:52.580 --> 20:55.700
That man can't, he's not responsible enough to get his own rolls.

20:55.700 --> 20:57.060
I mean, look at him.

20:57.060 --> 20:57.940
Look at him over there.

20:57.940 --> 20:58.740
So roll-less.

21:00.180 --> 21:00.680
Could.

21:00.680 --> 21:01.180
Could.

21:01.800 --> 21:03.880
I mean, would I eat them?

21:04.920 --> 21:10.280
Okay, there is a temperature at which these rolls would be served,

21:10.280 --> 21:13.640
where it would arrive on my doorstep where I think, whoa, nice.

21:13.640 --> 21:15.480
Somebody just breaks some fresh bread rolls.

21:15.480 --> 21:16.920
Oh, you're saying if they were warm.

21:16.920 --> 21:20.120
No, I'm saying there's a temperature at which I would think,

21:20.120 --> 21:23.000
oh, someone made freshly made rolls.

21:23.000 --> 21:26.440
Like if an oven on a truck rolled up and they pulled rolls out,

21:26.440 --> 21:29.720
threw them in a bag and see, I was going to go the other way, J-Man.

21:29.720 --> 21:31.320
I'm saying if I could just finish,

21:31.880 --> 21:34.360
there's a temperature at which I would make that assumption.

21:34.360 --> 21:35.640
There is another temperature.

21:35.640 --> 21:40.760
It is one degree next to that one where I think, what the fuck happened to these rolls?

21:40.760 --> 21:42.600
Did you leave them in your car?

21:42.600 --> 21:44.600
Did you leave them underneath your seat?

21:44.600 --> 21:46.440
Where these rolls come from?

21:46.440 --> 21:49.480
I think if they're frozen, I feel a lot more comfortable.

21:49.480 --> 21:53.560
If somebody brings me like pop in the oven set to 350 for 45 minutes

21:53.560 --> 21:55.080
and these rolls will be done rolls.

21:55.080 --> 21:56.760
I'm like, okay, you went to the store.

21:56.760 --> 21:58.040
You bought too many frozen rolls.

21:58.040 --> 21:58.760
Do you got it?

21:58.760 --> 22:03.080
This mystery frozen rolls left on your doorstep are the act of an assailant.

22:04.440 --> 22:08.200
You would rather have hot rolls like so delicious, can't say no to these.

22:08.200 --> 22:11.400
Guys, we got a new like hot, would you rather thing.

22:11.400 --> 22:13.720
It's the new cake or pie, Elvis or Beatles.

22:13.720 --> 22:18.040
Would you rather eat mystery frozen bread rolls left at your door

22:18.040 --> 22:21.240
or mystery hot and fresh out the kitchen bread rolls left at your door?

22:21.240 --> 22:23.000
I would like to make one argument.

22:23.000 --> 22:23.960
I think we'll settle this.

22:23.960 --> 22:26.040
I'll mediate because I'll eat both those motherfuckers.

22:26.040 --> 22:31.240
If they're frozen, you're going to bake them at 350 for a set amount of time

22:31.240 --> 22:33.480
and bake a lot of evil away.

22:33.480 --> 22:36.520
If they're hot and fresh, you just pop them straight in your mouth.

22:36.520 --> 22:38.760
Anthrax, anthrax burn right off.

22:38.760 --> 22:39.560
Burn that right off.

22:39.560 --> 22:41.960
You burn any tiny bug germs off there.

22:41.960 --> 22:43.560
Toast that, Thrax.

22:43.560 --> 22:47.640
You're going to get, but you're just going to get a hot pipe and bag of rolls

22:47.640 --> 22:48.920
and just pop them in your mouth.

22:48.920 --> 22:49.880
Just in your rebuttal.

22:52.120 --> 22:53.560
That's a lot of work.

22:53.560 --> 22:58.760
And I think that I would not, I think a hot roll is a roll from a friend.

22:58.760 --> 23:02.280
A frozen roll is a roll from somebody who wants to waste your afternoon.

23:02.280 --> 23:04.600
And I would trust the first person more than I would the second.

23:05.480 --> 23:09.880
Who in your life would you find out you got a hyping hot rolls from?

23:09.880 --> 23:11.080
And you go, that makes sense.

23:11.080 --> 23:14.120
One of my greatest regrets is that I've not cultivated a life

23:14.120 --> 23:17.560
in which I've drawn people around me that would leave piping hot rolls on my doorstep.

23:17.560 --> 23:20.520
I think I have many mystery admirers who would bring me frozen rolls

23:20.520 --> 23:21.720
and that would make sense to me.

23:21.720 --> 23:24.360
They'd be like, here, I took three steps.

23:24.360 --> 23:25.400
You take three steps.

23:25.400 --> 23:26.360
We meet in the middle.

23:26.360 --> 23:27.480
I got you some frozen ones.

23:27.480 --> 23:28.280
You bake them yourself.

23:28.280 --> 23:29.080
And now we're best friends.

23:29.080 --> 23:33.240
It is weird to think about, like, there's definitely a period in history where,

23:33.240 --> 23:35.320
like, if you were to watch a movie about Robin Hood

23:35.320 --> 23:40.520
and he was just like left a basket full of piping hot rolls on a poor family's doorstep,

23:40.520 --> 23:43.720
they'd open the door and be like, oh, it's amazing.

23:43.720 --> 23:44.760
We'll live through the week.

23:44.760 --> 23:47.640
And there's something that happened at some date where somebody's like,

23:47.640 --> 23:48.520
what have you done?

23:48.520 --> 23:49.560
What the fuck?

23:49.560 --> 23:50.360
What is this?

23:50.360 --> 23:51.960
I also want you to know that in my mind,

23:51.960 --> 23:54.440
the sound that Robin Hood made when he dropped those rolls off was,

23:54.440 --> 23:57.800
thwip, Robin Hood away, which I'm pretty sure is not correct.

23:57.800 --> 24:03.480
I just want to say top answer here from Forte88ing says,

24:03.480 --> 24:07.640
nope, I'd either take it to the park for youngsters to feed the ducks

24:07.640 --> 24:11.400
or give it to my neighbor as I don't eat bread other than dark rye.

24:13.080 --> 24:16.120
Forte, how do you know they aren't dark rye rolls, bud?

24:16.120 --> 24:17.800
They might be dark rye rolls.

24:17.800 --> 24:20.760
And what if your neighbor put them there and now you look like a real dick?

24:20.760 --> 24:22.520
If you're like, somebody dropped these rolls, I don't want them.

24:22.520 --> 24:23.080
Gross, right?

24:23.080 --> 24:25.480
Your neighbor's like, yeah, gross, I guess that would be.

24:26.520 --> 24:27.560
What if the rolls came-

24:27.560 --> 24:30.520
The one thing I can say concretely about the person who answered that question

24:30.520 --> 24:32.120
is that they have never met a young child.

24:32.120 --> 24:32.600
Yeah.

24:32.600 --> 24:34.760
Because if you're running stats on whether or not

24:34.760 --> 24:38.200
these kids are going to pop one of those bad boys in their mouth, job one,

24:38.200 --> 24:41.000
you have not met a little kid because that has happened.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.720
That's the first thing they do is going to put that right in their mouth.

24:43.720 --> 24:47.720
And I remember when I was a tot and I would walk around the park so forlorn

24:47.720 --> 24:50.840
because I just didn't have random rolls to feed the duck.

24:50.840 --> 24:54.440
Just hoping for some roll hero to bring me some mystery rolls.

24:54.440 --> 24:56.920
You'd grab bread out of the fucking duck's mouth

24:56.920 --> 24:58.840
just so you could throw it back to other ducks.

24:58.840 --> 24:59.160
Yeah.

24:59.160 --> 25:01.400
They were like, no, duck, you've had enough.

25:01.400 --> 25:06.120
What, as a parent, I cannot imagine a reality in which I was like,

25:06.120 --> 25:09.880
hey, I got some, I got a piping hot roll for you, youngster.

25:09.880 --> 25:15.080
You see, I only eat dark rye and somebody left these on my doorstep.

25:15.080 --> 25:18.280
Then the creepy roll man away.

25:18.280 --> 25:19.560
Why does everyone have Spider-Man?

25:21.400 --> 25:23.080
You gave everybody Spider-Man abilities.

25:24.920 --> 25:26.120
Should we go in the money zone?

25:26.120 --> 25:26.680
Yeah, we should.

25:39.160 --> 25:42.120
First monster this week I want to tell you all about is Casper.

25:43.000 --> 25:44.520
I've been sleep on that Casper.

25:44.520 --> 25:47.080
Griffin, actually Griffin, why don't you do this one?

25:47.080 --> 25:48.120
Because you've been sleep on a Casper.

25:48.120 --> 25:48.440
You could-

25:48.440 --> 25:50.680
Let me say this about Casper and I don't want to read all this stuff

25:50.680 --> 25:51.880
because I'm very tired.

25:51.880 --> 25:54.120
I've eaten six crackers in three days,

25:54.120 --> 25:56.840
but it's made for a wonderful bed for my convalescence.

25:58.600 --> 26:02.680
If you are going to get severe diarrhea-

26:02.680 --> 26:03.800
If you're planning-

26:03.800 --> 26:06.840
Can we just say illness, please God.

26:06.840 --> 26:09.880
If you're planning to be out of commission for several days.

26:09.880 --> 26:14.840
Yeah, this is the bed you want to be running from every half hour on the hour.

26:14.840 --> 26:18.200
It's easy to get out of and it's easy to ease back into.

26:18.200 --> 26:19.720
This is going to be perfect for you.

26:19.720 --> 26:23.480
This is the exact bed you want to be thinking about getting back into when you're on the toilet.

26:23.480 --> 26:25.560
You know, sometimes you lay down on the bed and you sink in.

26:25.560 --> 26:28.440
You got to push yourself out, but sometimes you shit your bones out.

26:28.440 --> 26:31.320
You can't push yourself out of a bed anymore.

26:32.120 --> 26:32.680
But Casper-

26:32.680 --> 26:35.240
If you need a bed in which to regrow your skeleton.

26:35.240 --> 26:41.800
Casper has a risk-free trial and return policy.

26:41.800 --> 26:43.640
Try sleeping on it for a hundred days

26:43.640 --> 26:47.320
with free delivery to US and Canada and painless returns.

26:48.440 --> 26:50.360
Matches are made in America.

26:51.160 --> 26:53.480
You know those dogs that have been mistreated

26:53.480 --> 26:56.520
and so anybody tries to show them kindness, they try to bite their hand?

26:57.080 --> 26:59.560
I feel like sometimes we act like that with our advertisers.

26:59.560 --> 27:02.360
Like we're trying to push them away to make them prove their love.

27:03.000 --> 27:04.040
We don't deserve your love, Casper.

27:04.040 --> 27:05.880
We don't deserve this money, Casper.

27:05.880 --> 27:09.160
Here's the story about convalescence.

27:09.160 --> 27:10.280
But here's the good news.

27:10.280 --> 27:12.440
Casper mattresses are so affordable.

27:12.440 --> 27:14.440
You won't worry about putting a sick relative in them

27:15.000 --> 27:18.520
because you love them, but you can replace them at a reasonable rate.

27:19.160 --> 27:21.080

We've been working on our TV show, trying to get our look right.

27:43.480 --> 27:45.880
And the one thing I didn't worry about is a gray sweater.

27:45.880 --> 27:46.760
You know why?

27:46.760 --> 27:47.720
Because of Trunk Club.

27:48.520 --> 27:51.240

Or Chunk Cub.

28:59.080 --> 28:59.400
Okay.

28:59.400 --> 29:00.760
Well, you've belittled me.

29:00.760 --> 29:01.480
I thought you did great.

29:01.480 --> 29:03.080
Welcome to the Chunk Club.

29:03.080 --> 29:04.600

29:04.600 --> 29:09.240
I'm gonna get you some fashion at the Chunk Club.

29:09.240 --> 29:12.040
This is a message for Michael from Cindy.

29:12.040 --> 29:14.840
You are the absolute best person I could ask to marry.

29:14.840 --> 29:17.880
You are so good, I know you won't be mad whenever this shows up,

29:17.880 --> 29:22.200
even though I promised to do this in June of 2015 and completely forgot.

29:22.200 --> 29:23.960
Also, brothers, please weigh in.

29:23.960 --> 29:29.240
Would the last name for Richardson make us sound like sexy bank robbers?

29:29.240 --> 29:33.720
V-R-I-C-H-A-R-D-S-O-N for Richardson.

29:34.760 --> 29:37.000
Only in the sense that when you make a deposit and like,

29:37.000 --> 29:37.720
what's your last name?

29:37.720 --> 29:38.520
Richardson.

29:38.520 --> 29:40.440
And then they spend an hour trying to spell it.

29:40.440 --> 29:42.600
And by then, like, they're like, okay, I think I finally,

29:42.600 --> 29:43.800
wait, the vault's empty.

29:43.800 --> 29:45.000
And where's all our pins?

29:45.000 --> 29:45.960
Where's all our pins?

29:45.960 --> 29:47.080
And that's your signature.

29:47.080 --> 29:47.960
You see all the pins.

29:47.960 --> 29:50.440
We tell people this all the time, you don't have to take the heat

29:50.440 --> 29:51.240
for forgetting this stuff.

29:51.240 --> 29:51.800
We'll do that.

29:51.800 --> 29:52.440
Put it on us.

29:53.880 --> 29:57.880
Why, I remember back in June of 2015 when Cindy first sent this message in.

29:57.880 --> 29:58.600
There you go.

29:58.600 --> 30:00.280
I want to tell everybody about Heath Sledge.

30:00.920 --> 30:05.080
My dear friend, Heath Sledge, is not someone I have met,

30:05.080 --> 30:10.920
but she is an academic writing consultant who wants to make your academic writing

30:10.920 --> 30:12.760
tasks feel less stomach achingly awful.

30:13.400 --> 30:17.800
She's a freelance editor with a PhD in English and 10 years of experience

30:17.800 --> 30:19.320
working with academic writers.

30:19.320 --> 30:24.040
And Heath wants to help you finish and or publish your journal article,

30:24.040 --> 30:28.440
grant application, dissertation, book manuscript without tears,

30:28.440 --> 30:30.200
ulcers, excessive drinking.

30:30.200 --> 30:31.560
That was probably tears.

30:31.560 --> 30:35.480
Do you think that Heath would help me write like a book of sad libs?

30:35.480 --> 30:39.080
Or I actually have an idea for a play that I'm not allowed to discuss

30:39.080 --> 30:40.680
until I complete other projects.

30:40.680 --> 30:43.080
If Heath did that, Heath could be tried for war crimes.

30:43.080 --> 30:43.880
And I don't think he-

30:43.880 --> 30:44.840
The play would be good.

30:44.840 --> 30:46.040
The sad libs would be bad.

30:46.040 --> 30:51.800
Yeah, so heathsledge.com, go there and make your writing better.

30:51.800 --> 30:53.640
It can be scary to start a writing project

30:53.640 --> 30:55.400
because you sit there like, well, this is bad.

30:55.400 --> 30:57.640
But Heath is going to sit there and both make it good

30:57.640 --> 30:59.160
and tell you it's good so you don't have to worry about-

30:59.160 --> 31:01.880
I think you should start your project before you get in touch with Heath.

31:01.880 --> 31:03.000
I don't think he's going to walk-

31:03.000 --> 31:05.160
Call Heath and say, I have an idea for a dissertation.

31:05.160 --> 31:06.280
What do you think?

31:06.280 --> 31:08.920
You shouldn't call Heath and be like, yo, Heath, what are we doing?

31:08.920 --> 31:11.480
Heath, I want to make a bespoke presentation.

31:12.040 --> 31:14.760
Heath, what's a book I could do for writing?

31:14.760 --> 31:15.480
It's quite possible.

31:15.480 --> 31:17.560
I need to call Heath to find out what the word bespoke is.

31:17.560 --> 31:19.080
I use it a lot in my day-to-day life

31:19.080 --> 31:20.280
and I've just realized I'm not a hundred percent-

31:20.280 --> 31:21.480
That's an easy job for Heath.

31:21.480 --> 31:25.080
Heath would appreciate you giving her a job like that, easy.

31:25.080 --> 31:25.880
What's bespoke?

31:25.880 --> 31:27.240
Well, I'll tell you.

31:27.240 --> 31:27.800
Job over.

31:33.400 --> 31:36.360
Hi, are you a fan of Star Trek The Next Generation?

31:36.920 --> 31:39.480
Well, that's weird because it's a corny show.

31:39.480 --> 31:43.880
But my friends Ben Harrison and Adam Pranica do a lovely podcast about it.

31:43.880 --> 31:47.480
It's called The Greatest Generation and it's on MaximumFun.org.

31:48.040 --> 31:51.960
I thought that this podcast was a bad idea, but I was wrong.

31:51.960 --> 31:56.280
Please listen to The Greatest Generation on MaximumFun.org.

31:59.240 --> 32:01.720
Three weeks ago, praying mantis showed up on our back door.

32:02.840 --> 32:06.040
After a week, I put her in a box and moved her in my neighbor's garden.

32:06.040 --> 32:08.120
But the next day she was back in the same place.

32:08.120 --> 32:08.920
Oh man.

32:08.920 --> 32:11.800
I don't want to kill her, but she's been very big.

32:11.800 --> 32:16.040
And my wife and I are both too nervous to use the back door in case she jumps on us.

32:16.040 --> 32:17.080
Very real danger.

32:17.080 --> 32:18.600
True, real danger.

32:18.600 --> 32:21.160
Plus she hangs out on the screen and is always watching.

32:21.160 --> 32:21.960
What should I do?

32:21.960 --> 32:22.840
Creeped in Chicago.

32:22.840 --> 32:23.960
What are you doing in there?

32:25.000 --> 32:26.600
Have you heard the good news?

32:26.600 --> 32:27.960
I'm a praying mantis.

32:29.000 --> 32:35.560
I do, listen, I'm not a big bug, spider, you know, tiny crawly thing person.

32:35.560 --> 32:36.760
You're not a big spider, Travis.

32:36.760 --> 32:37.560
I'm not a big spider.

32:37.560 --> 32:38.280
We've covered this.

32:38.280 --> 32:43.720
But I would say that, like, there is no amount of big that that praying mantis is,

32:43.720 --> 32:45.640
that it is any threat to you.

32:45.640 --> 32:46.920
Yeah, but that doesn't scare you.

32:46.920 --> 32:48.920
This is, here, I'll murk a spider.

32:48.920 --> 32:50.600
I don't fucking care.

32:50.600 --> 32:55.160
A praying mantis is so exotic and beautiful and yet also scary.

32:55.160 --> 32:58.200
This is the perfect bug for this situation to be about.

32:58.200 --> 33:03.320
Because like, I couldn't kill a praying mantis because it's got too much personality.

33:03.320 --> 33:04.120
Two reasons why.

33:04.120 --> 33:05.800
First reason, too exotic.

33:05.800 --> 33:07.640
I, they may be, they may be like.

33:07.640 --> 33:08.600
It could grant wishes.

33:08.600 --> 33:09.560
It could grant wishes, I don't know.

33:09.560 --> 33:09.960
For sure.

33:09.960 --> 33:12.600
The second thing is they have too much stuff.

33:13.640 --> 33:19.640
Like, if I gooshed a praying mantis, like, they have too many parts that I would see gooshed.

33:19.640 --> 33:22.120
Like a mosquito, you just like, blap, and it's just like a.

33:22.120 --> 33:22.600
Dust.

33:22.600 --> 33:23.240
Dust, man.

33:23.240 --> 33:24.280
You just dust them.

33:24.280 --> 33:27.000
Praying mantis would be like, I don't know, stepping on a crab or something.

33:27.000 --> 33:28.120
Like, there's too much stuff.

33:28.120 --> 33:30.360
I would also say that of all the bugs in the world,

33:30.360 --> 33:33.320
the praying mantis is the one that I could most see like having as a pet.

33:33.320 --> 33:33.640
Sure.

33:33.640 --> 33:34.840
Because it seems to have personality.

33:34.840 --> 33:35.720
Does the head tilt?

33:35.720 --> 33:38.120
Well, it's going to go crazier because its hands are swords, so.

33:38.120 --> 33:41.720
What I'm saying, when it looks at you, it like does, it seems to have personality.

33:41.720 --> 33:44.920
It has a little bit going for it that I don't see in other bugs,

33:44.920 --> 33:48.600
but I see a praying mantis like hanging out and I'm like, hey, how is your day?

33:48.600 --> 33:50.360
And it seems to be really interesting in mine.

33:50.360 --> 33:51.240
Well, you know what?

33:51.240 --> 33:53.400
I'm going to go out on a limb more so than a goldfish.

33:53.400 --> 33:55.080
I think a praying mant, maybe that's it.

33:55.080 --> 33:58.920
Maybe this praying mantis, just like a dog, if a dog kept showing up on your porch,

33:58.920 --> 34:01.880
you wouldn't put the dog in a box and take it over to your neighbor's garden.

34:01.880 --> 34:04.760
No, you would like, well, maybe adopt a dog or you'd call someone.

34:04.760 --> 34:06.440
It depends on if you're a dog person or not.

34:06.440 --> 34:09.400
If a cat kept coming around, you put a little dish of cream for them.

34:09.400 --> 34:09.880
You know what I mean?

34:09.880 --> 34:12.920
I'm saying maybe this praying mantis has scoped inside your house from the back door.

34:12.920 --> 34:15.560
It's like, wow, that's a pretty sweet setup in there.

34:15.560 --> 34:16.680
I would like to get in on this.

34:16.680 --> 34:17.720
Happy part of your family.

34:17.720 --> 34:21.160
I would like to be in your, it's cold as shit out here and it's bad.

34:21.160 --> 34:22.360
And then you put me in a garden.

34:22.360 --> 34:24.360
I came all the way back because I love you.

34:24.360 --> 34:25.640
You ever seen Homeward Bound?

34:25.640 --> 34:26.840
I just did a small version of that.

34:26.840 --> 34:27.960
I did a small Homeward Bound.

34:27.960 --> 34:30.280
And you know, Homeward and Bow and they put the dogs in a box

34:30.280 --> 34:31.720
and they put them in the neighbor's house.

34:31.720 --> 34:34.920
And like three minutes later, they're right back.

34:35.480 --> 34:40.440
I'm saying maybe open your heart and let a praying mantis in.

34:40.440 --> 34:43.320
I think if I'm your neighbor also, by the way.

34:43.320 --> 34:43.720
Thank you.

34:43.720 --> 34:44.040
Thanks.

34:44.040 --> 34:44.440
Thank you.

34:44.440 --> 34:44.680
Thanks.

34:44.680 --> 34:48.680
Probably what would probably facilitate this is the neighbor looks out and they see a box

34:48.680 --> 34:51.960
in their garden and then they go out there and they're like, what the fuck is this?

34:51.960 --> 34:53.800
Even better if they see you doing it.

34:53.800 --> 34:54.520
What are they doing?

34:54.520 --> 34:56.920
It's like Steve's in our garden with a box.

34:56.920 --> 34:58.280
Should we call somebody?

34:58.280 --> 34:58.920
Oh, I know.

34:58.920 --> 35:00.280
This is some bread rolls for me.

35:00.280 --> 35:01.400
Yee pop.

35:01.400 --> 35:01.880
What?

35:01.880 --> 35:02.380
No.

35:03.160 --> 35:04.520
There's not bread rolls in your house.

35:04.520 --> 35:05.240
This isn't bread rolls.

35:05.240 --> 35:06.120
This is a bug.

35:06.920 --> 35:07.560
Very nice bug.

35:07.560 --> 35:10.360
This is a bug with swords on its hands.

35:10.360 --> 35:13.240
This is a bug with a sign around its neck that says you're a problem now.

35:14.600 --> 35:18.760
I'm looking at pictures of praying mantises and guys, I just cannot get behind this.

35:18.760 --> 35:21.080
Look at the personality of that praying mantis' face.

35:21.080 --> 35:22.040
His eyes are red.

35:22.040 --> 35:23.400
Why do you like this?

35:23.400 --> 35:24.600
I don't like it.

35:24.600 --> 35:28.360
I'm just saying that that praying mantis looks to me like it's going, hey.

35:28.360 --> 35:29.400
How about this one?

35:29.400 --> 35:30.040
This yahoo.

35:30.040 --> 35:31.080
You guys want this yahoo?

35:31.080 --> 35:32.440
Wouldn't it be manti?

35:32.440 --> 35:33.240
Praying mantis?

35:33.240 --> 35:33.800
It's not important.

35:33.800 --> 35:34.760
Do you guys want a yahoo though?

35:36.280 --> 35:37.560
How big are they though?

35:37.560 --> 35:38.920
They can be arm length.

35:38.920 --> 35:39.560
They can be-

35:39.560 --> 35:40.520
You're kidding me.

35:40.520 --> 35:42.520
See, I've been talking a big fucking game.

35:42.520 --> 35:47.160
If that boy's longer than like two inches long, we don't have a discussion.

35:47.160 --> 35:48.200
There's not a discussion here.

35:48.200 --> 35:49.800
I'm calling the authorities.

35:49.800 --> 35:51.960
Yeah, I would call the cops probably.

35:52.920 --> 35:54.040
We call the police.

35:54.040 --> 35:57.880
We've got like a it came from the desert kind of situation here that I'm not comfortable with.

35:57.880 --> 35:59.320
Hi, it's me, Justin.

35:59.320 --> 36:02.280
We have an it came from the desert situation at my house.

36:02.280 --> 36:03.160
We'll be right there.

36:03.160 --> 36:05.480
You, of course, remember the IBM classic.

36:05.480 --> 36:07.880
Are you familiar with the Pokemon Scyther?

36:08.600 --> 36:11.000
It's real and it's happening to me.

36:12.280 --> 36:13.960
Do you want a yahoo?

36:13.960 --> 36:15.720
Damn, I haven't thought about it came from the desert.

36:15.720 --> 36:16.520
Oh, damn.

36:16.520 --> 36:19.720
We are never going to get to this fucking yahoo.

36:19.720 --> 36:20.760
I miss you guys.

36:20.760 --> 36:21.640
It's a good game.

36:21.640 --> 36:22.680
It's a good game.

36:22.680 --> 36:25.560
Hey, do you guys want to maybe do a yahoo?

36:25.560 --> 36:26.200
Yeah, I love that.

36:26.200 --> 36:28.520
This one was sent in by riding high, Rachel Rosen.

36:28.520 --> 36:29.080
Thank you.

36:29.080 --> 36:31.720
Wait, no, that's Zoe Kinski saying son of a game recognized game.

36:31.720 --> 36:32.520
Rachel Rosen.

36:32.520 --> 36:37.080
Sorry, I'm I don't have any bones from yahoo answers.

36:37.080 --> 36:38.680
User no name.

36:38.680 --> 36:41.720
So we're going to go to the next one, which is Supernova Mike Eleven.

36:43.400 --> 36:46.360
Supernova Mike one through ten was taken.

36:46.360 --> 36:49.560
Yeah, Supernova Mike Eleven asks in all caps.

36:49.560 --> 36:53.000
Can a paleontologist like Jurassic Park or no?

36:54.120 --> 36:55.480
I hear people say all the time.

36:55.480 --> 37:01.160
Nobody who truly likes dinosaurs should like be a fan of Jurassic Park because it's inaccurate.

37:01.160 --> 37:04.760
I'm an aspiring paleontologist and I adore the movie.

37:04.760 --> 37:08.120
But can I still like it if I'm an aspiring paleontologist?

37:08.120 --> 37:10.280
That word's a lot of word to wrap your mouth around.

37:10.920 --> 37:14.360
People act like you cannot like both frown face update.

37:14.360 --> 37:19.560
People call JP fans all the time fanboy and say they know nothing of real dinos.

37:19.560 --> 37:20.520
I do.

37:20.520 --> 37:24.040
This movie is what made me want to become a paleontologist.

37:24.040 --> 37:25.640
I know some dinos have feathers.

37:25.640 --> 37:26.440
I know all this.

37:27.000 --> 37:31.880
But can I still be a massive fan of the movie if I become a paleontologist?

37:32.440 --> 37:33.160
How often?

37:33.720 --> 37:34.280
Hold on.

37:34.280 --> 37:36.600
I'm going to pick right out of the middle there and say,

37:36.600 --> 37:39.960
how often does it come up that you're standing in a circle of people and you're like,

37:39.960 --> 37:41.320
I like Jurassic Park in circles.

37:41.320 --> 37:42.200
Fanboy.

37:42.200 --> 37:45.960
Well, I'm I'm betting if you're a paleontologist more than you would think.

37:45.960 --> 37:48.360
Aspiring paleontologist, Justin.

37:48.360 --> 37:52.920
I wonder how many times this versus around other paleontologists before you have to stop

37:52.920 --> 37:56.360
being an aspiring paleontologist and you're just a paleontologist at that point.

37:56.360 --> 37:59.720
Because if you're an aspiring paleontologist, you're a person who likes dinosaurs.

37:59.720 --> 38:02.600
See, that word is a real, it's a trouble, it's a problem.

38:02.600 --> 38:03.960
And I think it's paleontology.

38:03.960 --> 38:06.680
If you're hanging with a squad of paleontology.

38:06.680 --> 38:09.960
I'm actually going to say let's not let's stop saying trying to say paleon,

38:09.960 --> 38:11.720
paleon, paleo.

38:11.720 --> 38:12.680
To say paleos.

38:12.680 --> 38:14.360
And let's just say dino boys.

38:14.360 --> 38:17.160
If you're a dino boy and you're hanging out with other dino boys.

38:17.160 --> 38:19.160
I just watched Justin his face on his microphone.

38:19.720 --> 38:20.520
Dumb animal.

38:20.520 --> 38:24.840
I what I'm trying to think of other examples of movies that would fall under this.

38:24.840 --> 38:25.320
That's the problem.

38:25.320 --> 38:27.960
You don't have a lot of dino options if you're a dino boy.

38:27.960 --> 38:31.160
No, I'm saying like if you want to be like if you're an aspiring doctor,

38:31.160 --> 38:33.400
can you say your favorite movie is Patch Adams?

38:33.400 --> 38:35.000
You know, like what's what's the other ones?

38:35.000 --> 38:40.040
We're like, if you're if you're a vampire slayer, you just can't like Van Helsing.

38:40.840 --> 38:44.520
Well, no, that one actually works if you can't be a vampire fan.

38:44.520 --> 38:45.240
Because here's the thing.

38:45.240 --> 38:48.440
JP one, they don't really do nothing to the dinos, really.

38:48.440 --> 38:50.920
But by the time you get to JP four or JW,

38:52.360 --> 38:56.600
they just are like, it's just Andy from Parks and Rec.

38:56.600 --> 39:00.680
Just shooting dinosaurs in the mouth with shotguns over and over and over and over again.

39:00.680 --> 39:03.320
And it's hard to be like, hell, yeah, fuck them up.

39:03.320 --> 39:06.280
But also be like, I want to study these beautiful beasts.

39:06.280 --> 39:09.320
I'm trying to do you think if you're like a historian,

39:09.320 --> 39:15.720
any movie about the past falls under this or like I can't like like 75% of movies.

39:15.720 --> 39:16.440
I cannot enjoy.

39:16.440 --> 39:19.720
I would say that like, there's a vast swath of like,

39:20.360 --> 39:25.640
medical shows that Sydney can't enjoy, or at least not without like a heavy scoff and a sigh.

39:25.640 --> 39:28.680
But I think you can still like them even if they're inaccurate, right?

39:28.680 --> 39:32.200
Like Grey's Anatomy is like, yeah, okay, they did the spinal tap.

39:32.200 --> 39:33.080
And that is how they did it.

39:33.080 --> 39:35.800
But then they fucked them right there on the bed.

39:35.800 --> 39:39.560
Yeah, that's just why we have to test that spine.

39:39.560 --> 39:41.000
It's like now you don't.

39:41.000 --> 39:43.240
I'm about to spinal tap that dick.

39:43.960 --> 39:44.440
What?

39:44.440 --> 39:46.280
That's not even the saying.

39:46.280 --> 39:47.880
I'm about to tap that dick.

39:47.880 --> 39:50.920
And then like, and then like the shin starts playing.

39:53.640 --> 39:55.080
Shonda get at me girl.

39:56.520 --> 39:57.960
Do you need a showrunner?

39:57.960 --> 39:59.480
Shonda, it's time.

39:59.480 --> 40:01.000
Let me fuck up that spot.

40:03.880 --> 40:06.760
Let me get all up in Grey's Anatomy and get crazy in there.

40:06.760 --> 40:07.320
It's time.

40:09.080 --> 40:12.120
My little bro taking shit on Grey's Anatomy or what?

40:12.120 --> 40:14.440
We're all ready for it.

40:14.440 --> 40:19.320
Well listen, the one thing is no production really can last longer than a half hour.

40:19.320 --> 40:21.000
Because Griffin is really gonna have to step up.

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
What's the worst thing you could let me do in one episode?

40:23.000 --> 40:23.960
Kill all the characters?

40:23.960 --> 40:25.400
You already did that Shonda.

40:25.400 --> 40:25.960
Come on.

40:27.000 --> 40:28.120
Let me get crazy.

40:28.120 --> 40:28.840
One episode.

40:28.840 --> 40:29.560
That's all I want.

40:29.560 --> 40:31.000
I'm gonna bring Kyle Chandler back.

40:31.000 --> 40:33.160
Yes, he did explode in that one episode.

40:33.160 --> 40:35.000
But I've got a way around it.

40:36.520 --> 40:38.520
I put him back together with sex.

40:38.520 --> 40:45.880
I guess it was sexiotomy and I put all the exploded meat back together.

40:45.880 --> 40:49.880
Half the characters of Grey's Anatomy are ghosts and they're falling in love with each other.

40:49.880 --> 40:53.000
It used to be people pining for ghosts but now the ghosts fall in love and they have

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
their own ghost adventures once the lights are out.

40:55.000 --> 40:55.880
Spinoff.

40:55.880 --> 40:56.600
Yeah.

40:56.600 --> 40:57.320
I love it.

40:58.120 --> 41:00.520
I would be the best Grey's Anatomy showrunner ever.

41:01.160 --> 41:04.520
This is actually why I can't watch Maren.

41:04.520 --> 41:07.160
Because I'm like that's not what podcasting is like.

41:07.160 --> 41:08.520
I can't do it.

41:08.520 --> 41:12.440
And also because he keeps shooting podcasters over and over again.

41:12.440 --> 41:15.080
It's like I can't celebrate this thing.

41:15.080 --> 41:16.120
I'm not okay with this.

41:17.320 --> 41:18.360
How long have we been going Juice?

41:18.920 --> 41:19.400
Well sir?

41:21.080 --> 41:22.440
44 minutes.

41:22.440 --> 41:22.920
Wow.

41:22.920 --> 41:26.200
It seems a lot longer when we're sitting in the same room, doesn't it fellas?

41:26.200 --> 41:27.560
No fucking shit.

41:28.120 --> 41:30.120
But we did record the intro already.

41:30.920 --> 41:31.480
What do you mean?

41:31.480 --> 41:33.560
That's included in the span of the 44.

41:33.560 --> 41:34.120
Cool.

41:34.120 --> 41:34.760
Yeah.

41:34.760 --> 41:35.960
We're doing great.

41:35.960 --> 41:37.240
Another question Justin.

41:38.840 --> 41:44.520
One thing I will say is we're making better time through questions than we normally would.

41:44.520 --> 41:44.760
Yeah.

41:45.480 --> 41:49.320
It's just because we're not being as funny because we're all together and we're so tired.

41:50.840 --> 41:51.720
I'm not tired.

41:51.720 --> 41:52.440
I feel great.

41:52.440 --> 41:54.600
And I'm ready to make a television program.

41:54.600 --> 41:55.160
Awesome, great.

41:55.160 --> 41:59.080
My little, the only thing that's slowing me down, my only baggage I'm carrying right now

41:59.080 --> 42:00.680
is I'm very worried about my little brother.

42:00.680 --> 42:01.720
Your little brother's dying.

42:01.720 --> 42:01.960
Yeah.

42:01.960 --> 42:02.840
That's the only problem.

42:02.840 --> 42:05.080
He's getting littler and littler as the day goes by.

42:05.080 --> 42:06.360
I've lost- He's three inches shorter.

42:06.360 --> 42:07.800
I've lost like seven pounds.

42:07.800 --> 42:09.160
Did you weigh yourself for sure?

42:09.160 --> 42:09.640
Yeah.

42:09.640 --> 42:09.880
Yeah?

42:10.520 --> 42:12.280
That's so good to get TV ready though.

42:12.280 --> 42:13.000
It's so bad to not.

42:13.000 --> 42:13.880
You're doing great.

42:13.880 --> 42:20.280
Yeah, I'm not TV ready though because you need bones to be on television.

42:20.280 --> 42:21.560
You need them TV bones.

42:22.280 --> 42:23.480
Read out a question Justin.

42:24.280 --> 42:26.600
A few days ago I was on a four hour flight to LA.

42:26.600 --> 42:29.960
The flight attendant handed out snacks to me and the other passengers in my row.

42:29.960 --> 42:33.240
A few minutes after I finished my cheese nips and peanuts, the man standing next to me picked

42:33.240 --> 42:37.160
up his unopened snacks and motioned them as if to say, would you like these?

42:37.160 --> 42:37.880
I read ahead.

42:38.600 --> 42:42.200
I motioned what I felt like was a firm no and said thanks anyway.

42:42.200 --> 42:46.200
And he placed the snacks on my tray and said, maybe you'll change your mind later.

42:46.200 --> 42:47.240
I didn't know what to do.

42:47.240 --> 42:49.720
I placed it in the seat pocket in front of me and put it on my tray.

42:49.720 --> 42:53.000
When the flight attendant came around to collect trash, I handed her the unwanted packs.

42:53.000 --> 42:54.120
Am I good?

42:54.120 --> 42:57.080
How can I avoid being the trash man for my fellow passengers?

42:57.080 --> 42:59.160
That's from Snack Attacked in Kansas City.

42:59.160 --> 43:01.640
That's exactly what this was Kansas City.

43:01.640 --> 43:03.320
This was a snack attack.

43:03.320 --> 43:04.600
You got attacked by snacks.

43:04.600 --> 43:09.320
Do you look, when you fly, do you dress yourself like a Dickensian orphan?

43:09.320 --> 43:12.520
Was he like trying to look out for you in like a paternal way?

43:12.520 --> 43:19.960
I just want to say that like the real, I want to know more about the character in this story

43:19.960 --> 43:22.840
that looked at you and said, you might want these later.

43:22.840 --> 43:27.560
And what I would say is a very mysterious way as though that person has some kind of

43:27.560 --> 43:32.280
precognizance or perhaps like is like, trust me, you'll need these cheese nips.

43:33.160 --> 43:33.960
Oh, shit.

43:33.960 --> 43:38.200
You're saying like at the airport, a pack of wild dogs gets loose and it's coming to

43:38.200 --> 43:38.760
attack you.

43:38.760 --> 43:42.200
And if you'd have the cheese nips, you use nips on dogs.

43:42.200 --> 43:46.280
Have you ever seen the movie Paycheck, which is a terribly named movie for what is actually

43:46.280 --> 43:50.680
a really cool concept where Ben Affleck sends himself a bag of cheese nips and he's like,

43:50.680 --> 43:51.640
you'll need these.

43:51.640 --> 43:52.520
It's that kind of thing.

43:52.520 --> 43:53.800
Only it's a passenger.

43:53.800 --> 43:54.840
Maybe from the future.

43:54.840 --> 43:55.560
I don't know.

43:55.560 --> 43:58.920
But I can't imagine another scenario in which I would look at a human being I didn't know

43:58.920 --> 44:00.760
and say, you might need these later.

44:00.760 --> 44:02.760
But OK, that was weird.

44:02.760 --> 44:04.040
That was a good movie.

44:04.040 --> 44:06.280
It was a good movie with a terrible, terrible name.

44:06.280 --> 44:09.560
A Philip K. Dick story, which I can't remember the name of.

44:09.560 --> 44:11.240
Do you remember the name of the story?

44:11.240 --> 44:22.280
It was Uncle Craiggy's funny day at the office or Colin or a wacky time machine ride to the

44:22.280 --> 44:29.480
future starring Ben Affleck starring Uma Thurman's boyfriend.

44:29.480 --> 44:31.640
I think I picked that up at the Scholastic Book Fair one.

44:31.640 --> 44:34.760
I picked it up and it was Uncle Craiggy's.

44:34.760 --> 44:36.760
OK, this one's on Philip K. Dick.

44:36.760 --> 44:37.960
OK, he did call it Paycheck.

44:37.960 --> 44:39.400
That's a terrible name.

44:39.400 --> 44:41.160
Then blame fucking Philip K. Dick, Travis.

44:41.160 --> 44:41.800
I would never.

44:41.800 --> 44:53.480
I don't know how much you have traveled, listener, but I think it is the highest form of hubris

44:54.200 --> 45:01.080
to not slip those snacks in your bag because I guarantee you here in about an hour, you're

45:01.080 --> 45:04.280
going to be in a cab and you're going to be trying to find your hotel and all you're going

45:04.280 --> 45:06.200
to be able to think about is the trash.

45:06.200 --> 45:10.040
You're literally going to think about calling the airline to say, those are legally my nibs.

45:10.040 --> 45:10.920
Can you please fish them out?

45:10.920 --> 45:12.120
Did somebody grab those?

45:12.120 --> 45:13.400
Did somebody save those nibs?

45:13.960 --> 45:15.480
This whole time, just a quick poll.

45:15.480 --> 45:19.320
Have I been have have we been saying nibs or nibs?

45:19.320 --> 45:21.080
I've been saying nibs.

45:21.080 --> 45:23.080
Is that not where the P?

45:23.080 --> 45:24.200
OK, is that nibs?

45:25.160 --> 45:28.840
I found I almost missed my flight here to Huntington.

45:28.840 --> 45:29.960
I missed my connection, I should say.

45:30.760 --> 45:35.880
I barely had time to run on and I was like two and I had not eaten lunch and luckily

45:35.880 --> 45:42.200
past me had left little Delta biscotti's and a Clif Bar and I was like, hello, sunshine.

45:43.160 --> 45:48.280
When I was flying here from anyway, and then I got norovirus, so maybe it was the biscote.

45:48.280 --> 45:55.000
When I moved here when flying from L.A. to Huntington, I was given a meal because I

45:55.000 --> 45:57.560
purchased a special seat because I'm a special boy.

45:57.560 --> 45:58.360
I was given a meal.

45:58.360 --> 46:03.560
I got a hamburger and I bit into that hamburger to find chunks of porcelain in it because

46:03.560 --> 46:08.680
the corner of the of the plate had broken and it had stuck to the lettuce and tomato

46:08.680 --> 46:09.960
that I put on the hamburger.

46:09.960 --> 46:13.480
And the point of this story is I scraped that porcelain off and I finished.

46:13.480 --> 46:15.080
Oh yeah, it's your fancy sky burger.

46:15.080 --> 46:16.920
I'm not going to turn down the sky burger.

46:16.920 --> 46:18.920
That's good mood food, baby.

46:18.920 --> 46:20.840
I'm not turning down that burger.

46:20.840 --> 46:24.200
And so did your cheese nibs have porcelain in them?

46:24.200 --> 46:28.440
Because if not, you have no excuse and Travis, you said you told me when I heard this story

46:28.440 --> 46:32.600
previously that you try to get another sky burger and they were like, no, we only brought

46:32.600 --> 46:34.200
we brought exactly enough.

46:34.200 --> 46:39.720
That's some great of both options because it was like it was a chicken salad sandwich

46:39.720 --> 46:44.120
and a hamburger and they like they bring like six and six, I guess.

46:44.120 --> 46:49.320
And like, that's that's a crazy gamble that like that you have exactly enough like

46:49.320 --> 46:50.120
we're in the air.

46:50.120 --> 46:51.240
What if I'm hung?

46:51.240 --> 46:55.640
I really actually am very uncomfortable now with the fact that like I get sky hungry.

46:55.640 --> 47:00.920
The only sort of assurance I've had is that like if I'm sky hungry, someone is going

47:00.920 --> 47:02.360
to be able to hook me up up there.

47:02.360 --> 47:05.800
The fact that they have literally enough rations for everyone aboard.

47:05.800 --> 47:06.760
Yeah, that's terrifying.

47:06.760 --> 47:08.040
Not everyone aboard, Justin.

47:08.040 --> 47:08.920
Everyone in the front.

47:08.920 --> 47:10.600
Like 10 rolls at the front.

47:10.600 --> 47:11.160
Oh, it is.

47:11.880 --> 47:15.560
And if you're in the back, I've seen them run out of the little snack trays that have

47:15.560 --> 47:16.840
grapes and cheese in it.

47:16.840 --> 47:19.240
Yeah, there's there's no there's nothing that will.

47:19.240 --> 47:20.680
You didn't bring enough Pringles for everybody.

47:20.680 --> 47:25.400
Betray your privilege quicker than like, hey, let's slow it down.

47:25.400 --> 47:26.520
Hey, not every.

47:26.520 --> 47:28.440
There's lots of great snack options.

47:28.440 --> 47:29.320
Sometimes sometimes.

47:29.320 --> 47:30.760
You don't have to get Pringles.

47:30.760 --> 47:33.800
I want the hummus, please, not the hummus.

47:33.800 --> 47:38.360
Sometimes when I'm sitting in the back of the plane and I'm walking to get my seat

47:38.360 --> 47:42.360
and I'm just walking past the people and like the first class in the front, like 20

47:42.360 --> 47:47.480
bros and like I just see all the people wearing the like shirts that say like good, good Pringles

47:47.480 --> 47:48.280
boy on it.

47:50.120 --> 47:54.360
They have little signs that say like, I can't wait to slam some Pringles and like little

47:54.360 --> 47:58.600
badges that say National American Pringles Convention.

47:58.600 --> 48:01.480
I don't know why it's both National and the American Pringles Convention.

48:02.200 --> 48:05.320
And some of them are just like big boys with Pringle crumbs in their mouths.

48:05.320 --> 48:08.280
And I just think like, I'm not going to get any fucking Pringles on this.

48:08.280 --> 48:09.720
They're not going to make it back to me, are they?

48:09.720 --> 48:11.240
Unless the Pringles start in the back of the plane.

48:11.240 --> 48:12.280
And that never happens.

48:12.280 --> 48:14.760
Never because that's what that's what they call it.

48:14.760 --> 48:16.040
Pilots privilege.

48:16.040 --> 48:19.480
Have you ever thought about pushing the button and when she comes in and they're like, how

48:19.480 --> 48:19.960
can I help you?

48:19.960 --> 48:21.480
And you're like Pringles.

48:21.480 --> 48:25.320
I'm like, no, we'll be bringing no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

48:25.320 --> 48:27.240
I ran a quick head count on my way in.

48:27.240 --> 48:28.040
You're not making it.

48:28.040 --> 48:29.480
Sir, we have a lot of Pringles.

48:29.480 --> 48:30.440
You shut up.

48:30.440 --> 48:31.000
Stop it.

48:31.000 --> 48:31.480
Shut up.

48:32.520 --> 48:33.800
You listen to me now.

48:33.800 --> 48:35.080
Look at all these Pringles fans.

48:37.640 --> 48:38.680
Count them with me.

48:38.680 --> 48:38.840
Yeah.

48:38.840 --> 48:39.640
One, two, three, four.

48:39.640 --> 48:40.360
There's too many.

48:40.360 --> 48:41.800
There's some Pring heads in here.

48:41.800 --> 48:43.880
Listen, I understand you can't bring them now.

48:44.520 --> 48:46.760
What I have in my hand is a $10 bill.

48:46.760 --> 48:49.560
This $10 bill could be in your hand.

48:49.560 --> 48:55.080
If maybe you just slide one underneath one of the wheels or that's not a good place for

48:55.080 --> 48:55.480
Pringles.

48:55.480 --> 48:59.000
No, you're on the ground.

48:59.560 --> 49:00.520
You're in Tulsa.

49:01.880 --> 49:02.680
I'm gone.

49:04.360 --> 49:06.120
What a what a terrible waste.

49:08.440 --> 49:10.520
After the snack service, go to the toilet.

49:10.520 --> 49:12.440
There'll be one remaining Pringles.

49:13.160 --> 49:16.840
Reach inside the hand, the lotion, the hand sanitizer.

49:16.840 --> 49:18.440
Pull out individual Pringles.

49:19.000 --> 49:21.880
Find a series of Pringles hidden underneath each thing.

49:21.880 --> 49:25.560
Fucking 15 rows in front of you hear a little boy like, thank you for buying me the chips,

49:25.560 --> 49:26.120
Daddy.

49:26.120 --> 49:27.800
And you're like, they're crisps.

49:27.800 --> 49:29.640
He doesn't even deserve them.

49:29.640 --> 49:32.280
They're reconstituted potato granules.

49:32.280 --> 49:33.560
But can I have one?

49:33.560 --> 49:35.080
Is he going to eat all of them?

49:35.080 --> 49:37.240
But do ask your boy to hit me up.

49:39.240 --> 49:43.480
Should we end the thanks Pringles for the thank you Pringles for the sponsorship.

49:44.840 --> 49:47.640
You know that then that's going to do it for us on our program.

49:47.640 --> 49:51.000
I was just about to talk more about Pringles and how they legally can be called.

49:51.000 --> 49:52.280
No, I know you talked about it.

49:52.280 --> 49:54.520
I can't tell you how many times you talked about this on the podcast.

49:55.880 --> 49:58.280
What episode of what episode of how Pringles are made?

49:58.280 --> 49:59.080
Did you watch?

49:59.080 --> 49:59.560
Go ahead.

49:59.560 --> 50:00.600
You guys wrap it up.

50:00.600 --> 50:01.320
No, you.

50:01.320 --> 50:02.840
I read an Uncle John's bathroom reader.

50:02.840 --> 50:04.440
Travis, did you have anything to add?

50:04.440 --> 50:06.600
No, I just going to say that I wanted to hear your story.

50:06.600 --> 50:09.640
Just I was excited to be in the same room with you for the first time.

50:09.640 --> 50:13.880
You know, for a while, you know, for a while.

50:13.880 --> 50:15.960
Are you drooling the Pringles?

50:15.960 --> 50:17.400
No, because I'm not talking about Pringles anymore.

50:17.400 --> 50:21.880
I'm talking about margarine for a while.

50:21.880 --> 50:26.680
The butter lobby made it so that margarine couldn't be yellow.

50:27.240 --> 50:31.320
So margarine, when you bought it in the store, we actually come with a little coloring packet

50:31.320 --> 50:34.760
that you that you would squeeze into your margin and stirred around to give a color.

50:34.760 --> 50:36.600
Would it be just white, just white?

50:36.600 --> 50:38.040
Yeah, that's so much fun.

50:38.040 --> 50:44.760
We need more interactive foods caused by lawyers, caused by lawyers and lobbyists.

50:44.760 --> 50:50.840
Anyway, that's my story about, this has been a Justin McElroy food fact.

50:50.840 --> 50:53.240
All right, that's going to do it for us.

50:53.240 --> 50:55.160
I'm so weak.

50:55.160 --> 50:56.360
You're going to live Griffin.

50:56.360 --> 50:57.240
I believe in you.

50:57.240 --> 51:01.480
I would like to encourage everybody because we are starting filming tomorrow or today,

51:01.480 --> 51:02.680
whenever you listen to this.

51:02.680 --> 51:06.200
And we're going to be like trying to do updates and pictures and stuff like that.

51:06.200 --> 51:10.200
So you can check out our Twitter at NBNBAM.

51:10.200 --> 51:13.720

51:18.040 --> 51:21.560
My brother, my brother and me all one word and we'll post photos and maybe some videos

51:21.560 --> 51:23.320
and stuff like that over the next couple of weeks.

51:23.320 --> 51:25.640
We have a PO box where people have sent us things.

51:25.640 --> 51:28.040
And I want to say some quick thank yous.

51:28.040 --> 51:30.360
Thanks to David for sending along the cereal.

51:30.360 --> 51:31.480
You're very kind.

51:31.480 --> 51:33.400
Vince, thank you for the meat sticks.

51:33.400 --> 51:34.840
Brenna, thank you for sending your book.

51:36.200 --> 51:38.680
Glenn Tickle sent us a copy of his CD.

51:38.680 --> 51:39.720
Yes, really.

51:41.240 --> 51:44.360
So you can check that out to check that out.

51:44.360 --> 51:46.520
And I should hold on.

51:46.520 --> 51:47.560
Let me grab that box.

51:47.560 --> 51:48.760
I'm going to grab a box.

51:48.760 --> 51:52.680
We should also say we're going to be doing our candlelight show at the end of the month.

51:52.680 --> 51:57.720
So if you have candlelight specific questions, start sending them in now with the with the

51:57.720 --> 51:59.800
subject line candle nights.

52:00.520 --> 52:04.760
And if you're going to be at the show, try to include that either like in somewhere in

52:04.760 --> 52:08.200
the body of the question or afterwards to let us know so that we're not sitting up on

52:08.200 --> 52:11.320
stage going, is Steven here and like a Steven.

52:11.320 --> 52:12.120
Well, that's a horrible name.

52:12.120 --> 52:16.360
But if it's like Steven's not a horrible, well, no, I mean, horrible example name can't

52:16.360 --> 52:19.800
like candle lights and and kills or whatever.

52:19.800 --> 52:23.400
And like, we'd want to know that name before we try to see if they were in-house.

52:23.400 --> 52:25.800
So, yeah, things are going to be a little weird for a few weeks.

52:25.800 --> 52:27.480
So just like thank you for hanging with us.

52:27.480 --> 52:29.400
It's your fault that we're in this.

52:29.400 --> 52:30.040
You made this out.

52:30.040 --> 52:31.000
Your support made this happen.

52:31.000 --> 52:33.480
Your support made this happen, you monsters.

52:33.480 --> 52:36.920
So you just got to, like, hang in there with us for a little bit and then we'll be back

52:36.920 --> 52:41.080
on on a regular, regular groove and we'll all be in different rooms again.

52:41.080 --> 52:44.520
Yeah, like as God intended, as it's supposed to be.
