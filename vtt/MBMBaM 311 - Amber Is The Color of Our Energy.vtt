00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:47.520
Hello everybody and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me, an advice show from the modern era.

00:47.520 --> 00:51.360
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother Travis of McElroy.

00:51.360 --> 00:57.280
I'm your sweet baby brother Griffin McElroy. And amber is the color of our energy. We made it.

00:57.280 --> 01:03.600
Guys, we did it. I knew that this would come around the bend. Now I see. Now we finally done did it.

01:03.600 --> 01:09.040
This is the one we got. Travis, look at the email you sent out about the show notes,

01:09.040 --> 01:14.400
and you tell me what we done did. Now see, I tried to do a 7-Eleven branded episode,

01:14.400 --> 01:21.600
and you said no. But 3-Eleven branded it? Ugh. 7-Eleven happens every year. I mean, that's

01:21.600 --> 01:28.320
optimistic. But like, we'll probably get another one of those. This only happens once. It's 3-Eleven,

01:29.040 --> 01:32.320
the episode. Alright, well now I'm just like taking the email full of questions and all the

01:32.320 --> 01:36.240
Yahoo answers I found and throwing them right in the dumpster. And I'm shutting the dumpster

01:36.240 --> 01:40.640
and calling the dumpster company to come take it away. Well, this is all of your 3-Eleven related

01:40.640 --> 01:46.640
Yahoo answers questions. Yeah, well there are a few of those. Uh, yeah. Um, what other songs did

01:46.640 --> 01:51.360
3-Eleven do? All Mixed Up? Was that them? That was one of their hits, right? Yeah. Let's establish

01:51.360 --> 01:56.000
some parameters before we get too deep on this. What's our main number 3-Eleven? I know that

01:56.000 --> 02:04.080
amber is the color of their energy. Whoa. I think they did Bubbly Toes. Okay, they did Bubbly Toes.

02:04.080 --> 02:15.760
Now, um, a lot of people say, Justin, how do you, uh, identify a, uh, a real artist? You know,

02:15.760 --> 02:21.600
how can you judge by their music? No, you can't. Can you judge by their look? No, you can't.

02:22.320 --> 02:29.200
Um, what you can judge by is whether or not that they have sponsored a, uh, NASCAR stock car

02:29.920 --> 02:40.320
as a 3-Eleven for Jeb Burton in 2015. If you're, uh, looking for it, look between the logos of,

02:40.320 --> 02:46.800
uh, Dr. Pepper and Maxim magazine, and right there you'll find the logo for the band 3-Eleven.

02:46.800 --> 02:52.480
Oh my god. Couldn't really afford a lot of car space, huh? No, not a big car space on that one.

02:52.480 --> 02:59.520
Can you pay to have somebody else's logo put onto a NASCAR? Yeah, it's kind of like how you can put

02:59.520 --> 03:05.040
by somebody's name on a star. By the way, I did buy a name for a star and I named it 3-Eleven.

03:05.040 --> 03:10.720
You guys know which star? The sun. The sun is named 3-Eleven. It was crazy. Like I was on the

03:10.720 --> 03:14.720
star registry website and they're like, pick a star. And I was like, let's just try the sun.

03:14.720 --> 03:20.800
Nobody damn thought of it first. So now the sun's named 3-Eleven. Please only refer to it as that

03:20.800 --> 03:24.880
because it's, and it's appropriate because it is the only source of light and heat in my life.

03:24.880 --> 03:28.400
Do you think it's possible that Jeb Burton was looking at his car and he's like,

03:28.400 --> 03:31.360
all right, you guys put whatever you want on here. This one's for Jeb.

03:31.360 --> 03:35.440
Just fucking slapping the 3-Eleven sticker on my car. That was just a sticker he picked up at a

03:35.440 --> 03:41.680
concert. That was not a sponsorship in any way. Could we pay to have 3-Eleven sponsor every car

03:41.680 --> 03:47.200
in NASCAR a little bit so that no matter what car wins, it's the 3-Eleven car?

03:48.800 --> 03:52.400
Do you guys know about the rumor that 3-Eleven was a racist name for a band?

03:52.400 --> 03:58.160
Learning about this from Yahoo Answers because the letter K is the 11th letter of the alphabet

03:58.160 --> 04:05.920
and so three Ks would be KKK and it doesn't necessarily seem to sort of align with the

04:05.920 --> 04:11.920
message of most of the band 3-Eleven songs, which are mostly just sort of about chill beach vibes.

04:12.480 --> 04:12.880
Are they?

04:14.320 --> 04:17.920
For the most part, yes. The actual origin of it is-

04:17.920 --> 04:19.040
Wait, can I guess?

04:19.040 --> 04:19.520
Yeah, please.

04:19.520 --> 04:25.360
See if I know this. Is 3-Eleven the police code for smoking weed?

04:25.360 --> 04:31.040
No, it is the police code for indecent exposure. You see, a man named P-Nut.

04:33.600 --> 04:35.520
They were skinny dipping in a public pool.

04:35.520 --> 04:35.600
Peter Nut.

04:35.600 --> 04:39.600
Peter Nut got arrested. He was cuffed naked and taken home to his parents.

04:39.600 --> 04:42.320
There, he was issued for a citation for a code 3-Eleven.

04:42.880 --> 04:45.200
We thought this was funny, so we took it as our band name.

04:45.920 --> 04:46.640
After the humor-

04:46.640 --> 04:48.160
It really got famous and now we hate it.

04:48.880 --> 04:52.880
After the humor of the name wore off, you mean like 15 minutes later?

04:52.880 --> 04:58.080
We still kept it because we liked that it was just abstract and did not define us in any way.

04:58.800 --> 04:59.600
Cool.

04:59.600 --> 05:04.000
I mean, that's true. I have basically no impressions about 3-Eleven as a band.

05:04.000 --> 05:07.840
I have no like, concepts of it. I do want to give them their propers, though.

05:07.840 --> 05:09.120
I want to give them some credit.

05:09.680 --> 05:15.360
According to Wikipedia, their music is a blend of rock, reggae, hip-hop, and funk.

05:15.360 --> 05:18.160
So God bless them, because somebody had to read that and say,

05:18.160 --> 05:23.520
hmm, okay, good. Let's make a CD out of it. Let's make a CD out of that.

05:23.520 --> 05:24.320
Yeah, here's some money.

05:24.320 --> 05:25.440
Here's some money. Let's make a CD out of this.

05:25.440 --> 05:29.120
We have a ton of it, apparently. It's the 90s. We don't know what to do with money.

05:29.120 --> 05:31.600
We're children tickling ourselves with razors.

05:31.600 --> 05:34.960
Truckin' Peanut was like, but I want to make a reggae CD.

05:35.520 --> 05:38.880
And fuckin' Zach was like, nah, man, all rock for me.

05:38.880 --> 05:40.720
And he lowered his shades and started smoking.

05:42.320 --> 05:45.600
You got your rock in my reggae. You got your reggae in my rock.

05:45.600 --> 05:51.760
So there are other genres that they've been classified as are alternative rock, reggae rock,

05:51.760 --> 05:54.720
rap rock, funk rock, alternative metal, and nu metal.

05:54.720 --> 05:57.360
Jesus. Alternative and nu metal. Both of the metals. Great.

05:57.920 --> 05:58.720
Whatever you're doing.

05:58.720 --> 06:01.040
You guys heard the story about how Amber came about, right?

06:02.080 --> 06:06.640
One of their dads had a cold, and he was trying to sneeze.

06:06.640 --> 06:09.920
And he went, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop.

06:09.920 --> 06:11.840
They're like, that was crazy. Can you do that at games?

06:11.840 --> 06:15.120
Like, yeah, sure. Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop.

06:15.120 --> 06:19.280
They just fuckin' recorded it. Put that down on the track. Put some reggae over it, baby.

06:20.560 --> 06:24.640
311 has a Caribbean cruise.

06:25.440 --> 06:25.680
No.

06:26.400 --> 06:29.840
Yep, the 311. It's called 311 Caribbean Cruises.

06:29.840 --> 06:32.320
It's a partner between 311 and Jonathan Coulton.

06:34.560 --> 06:40.720
They had Tom Green, Doug Benson, Less Than Jake, Revolution, Ex-Savvy.

06:40.720 --> 06:43.360
This actually sounds not bad. I would probably get on this cruise.

06:43.360 --> 06:45.360
This sounds all right now that I'm listening to it.

06:46.640 --> 06:47.680
What if they're really cool?

06:49.040 --> 06:50.480
They're probably pretty-

06:50.480 --> 06:53.120
Here's what I think. I actually believe this in my heart.

06:53.120 --> 06:59.120
I think that if you have had a big hit or two, and then you've managed to have any level of

06:59.120 --> 07:03.680
consistency and can still maintain a career from music after that,

07:03.680 --> 07:05.520
you're probably a pretty decent human being.

07:05.520 --> 07:06.240
And not only that-

07:06.240 --> 07:08.160
I feel like that's the only thing that propels you through.

07:08.160 --> 07:11.040
It may be naive, but I feel the exact same thing, Justin.

07:11.040 --> 07:20.080
That I bet people might turn their nose up and say a Dave Matthews or a Sublime or a 311.

07:20.080 --> 07:24.960
But I bet if you got the chance to chill with those dudes, it's probably chill as fuck.

07:24.960 --> 07:30.240
Well, they'll still smoke you the fuck out for sure, Travis, is that what you're-

07:30.240 --> 07:31.280
Yes, agreed.

07:31.280 --> 07:34.640
And they'll also show you the drawings that their kids did.

07:34.640 --> 07:35.120
You know what I mean?

07:35.120 --> 07:35.760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:35.760 --> 07:38.000
They're just people.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.480
They seem like reggae rock funk stars.

07:40.480 --> 07:44.640
You know that all of their iPhone lock screens are like pictures of sweet pandas and stuff?

07:44.640 --> 07:45.600
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

07:45.600 --> 07:48.960
Hey, before I unlock this to show you some of my kids' pictures that they drew,

07:48.960 --> 07:50.480
did you check this panda?

07:50.480 --> 07:52.240
Check out this chill funk panda.

07:52.240 --> 07:53.760
It's a cool panda.

07:53.760 --> 07:58.640
I have to imagine if you grow up and you come out of Nebraska and your whole thing is,

07:58.640 --> 08:02.480
we're going to do a reggae rock band, you probably, I mean,

08:02.480 --> 08:04.400
you at least have some thick skin, I think.

08:05.760 --> 08:07.520
You at least could take some heat.

08:07.520 --> 08:09.440
We're going to do some reggae nu metal.

08:09.440 --> 08:13.840
Nebraska? Are you ready, Nebraska, to reggae nu metal rock?

08:13.840 --> 08:17.280
Yeah, a little bit, I guess.

08:17.280 --> 08:18.880
What kind of music are you guys into?

08:18.880 --> 08:23.040
We're into a very steep uphill climb for many years

08:23.040 --> 08:25.920
with very little recognition is what we're kind of all about.

08:25.920 --> 08:29.600
This band started in 1988 AD, the year of our birth.

08:29.600 --> 08:30.560
Are you kidding me?

08:30.560 --> 08:30.560
No.

08:32.000 --> 08:36.960
Are you telling me that we are careening towards 30 years of 311?

08:36.960 --> 08:40.480
Happy 30th anniversary, 311.

08:41.920 --> 08:42.560
Wow.

08:42.560 --> 08:43.840
You're my favorite band.

08:45.760 --> 08:49.600
1988, this band was born the year after me.

08:50.960 --> 08:54.160
I remember the first time I heard 311, I was five.

08:54.160 --> 08:55.440
It changed my life.

08:55.440 --> 08:56.400
I just drank it in.

08:58.720 --> 09:00.320
Let's do some advice, I think, for people.

09:00.320 --> 09:03.760
Oh, we have a special guest this episode.

09:03.760 --> 09:04.720
Should we talk about that?

09:04.720 --> 09:07.680
Just like set it up and then hit that ball right in the hole later?

09:08.640 --> 09:09.520
Yeah, that sounds good.

09:10.080 --> 09:12.640
Joining us to be a guest, Bert, and I know you're listening,

09:12.640 --> 09:14.880
it's going like, wait, another person is going to be on the show?

09:14.880 --> 09:16.160
Yeah, we used to do that.

09:16.160 --> 09:21.360
It's been like two years, but we have a fantastic author,

09:21.360 --> 09:25.680
fantastic person, Patrick Rothfuss, is going to be on the show a bit later.

09:25.680 --> 09:26.960
But for now, let's do our thing.

09:26.960 --> 09:28.320
All right, here's our first question.

09:28.320 --> 09:31.200
Today on the train, I caught a woman taking a picture of me with her phone.

09:31.200 --> 09:31.760
Oh, boy.

09:31.760 --> 09:33.920
The weird thing is that after we made eye contact,

09:33.920 --> 09:36.000
she simply smiled and continued taking pictures.

09:36.000 --> 09:36.960
Oh, my God.

09:37.680 --> 09:41.040
The phone wasn't even muted, and I could hear the shutter noise of each picture.

09:42.080 --> 09:44.320
I thought that she might be taking selfies,

09:44.320 --> 09:45.600
but she followed me with her camera

09:45.600 --> 09:48.320
even after I moved a few rows down in the train.

09:48.320 --> 09:50.320
So my question is, what the fuck should I have done?

09:50.320 --> 09:51.680
Sincerely, Tom Cruise.

09:51.680 --> 09:53.440
Well, okay, so that one is.

09:54.160 --> 09:55.280
That one's pretty obvious.

09:57.200 --> 09:57.700
Okay.

09:58.320 --> 10:00.160
Shutter shy in San Francisco, by the way.

10:00.160 --> 10:03.920
Without discussing it, I want each of us to say

10:03.920 --> 10:07.120
why we think this woman was taking pictures of this person.

10:07.120 --> 10:08.320
Okay, kind of a choose your own adventure.

10:08.320 --> 10:08.720
I love it.

10:08.720 --> 10:09.920
Yeah, Justin, go.

10:09.920 --> 10:10.420
Art.

10:11.120 --> 10:11.620
Griffin?

10:12.880 --> 10:15.040
Maybe they looked like one of their friends

10:15.040 --> 10:17.200
and they wanted to text them a good picture of their face,

10:17.200 --> 10:18.800
but they kept looking away or something.

10:19.360 --> 10:22.640
Or alternate second guess, just like, I want to hedge my bets.

10:22.640 --> 10:23.680
She's a pervert.

10:24.640 --> 10:26.160
Oh, see, I was going to say pervert.

10:26.160 --> 10:26.660
Okay.

10:26.660 --> 10:30.580
You're going to end up taped to a wall with colored yarn

10:30.580 --> 10:33.300
stretching between you and pictures of weapons

10:33.300 --> 10:34.660
and I don't know, maybe the Pope.

10:34.660 --> 10:35.380
Who knows?

10:35.380 --> 10:38.260
What if you get a, you're going to get a parcel,

10:39.620 --> 10:41.460
not through the postal service because that leaves a trail.

10:41.460 --> 10:42.900
It's just going to show up on your door

10:42.900 --> 10:44.340
and there's going to be a note that says,

10:44.340 --> 10:46.740
I believe this should be to your specifications

10:46.740 --> 10:49.140
and it'll be a very tasteful suit jacket.

10:51.780 --> 10:53.780
I knew from the moment I saw you.

10:53.780 --> 10:55.300
I must sue him.

10:55.300 --> 10:58.020
To embroider you with my suitory.

10:58.020 --> 10:59.540
Alternative explanation,

10:59.540 --> 11:02.020
it is your great, great grandchild from the future.

11:02.900 --> 11:05.540
Travel back to capture pictures of the day

11:06.100 --> 11:07.460
that your whole life changed.

11:08.980 --> 11:11.620
Yesterday, I was at a pool party

11:11.620 --> 11:14.740
and a man showed up who was very drunk

11:14.740 --> 11:20.180
and he looked exactly like Till Death Do Us Blart

11:20.180 --> 11:24.660
and Worst Idea of All Time podcaster Guy Montgomery.

11:24.660 --> 11:30.580
The whole like a hundo percent DNA code splice combo.

11:30.580 --> 11:32.260
God, I would have been so fucking excited

11:32.260 --> 11:33.300
until I realized it wasn't him.

11:33.300 --> 11:33.620
I know.

11:33.620 --> 11:36.020
He's got a pool party and Guy Montgomery shows up?

11:36.020 --> 11:36.420
I know.

11:36.420 --> 11:38.420
So I tried to, I thought in my head,

11:38.420 --> 11:40.500
like it would be fun if I snapped a pic of this dude

11:40.500 --> 11:43.940
and like sent a picture over Twitter to Guy Montgomery.

11:43.940 --> 11:44.740
I bet he'd really enjoy it.

11:45.300 --> 11:46.660
Only the guy was wearing a Speedo

11:46.660 --> 11:48.660
and he was really partying hard

11:48.660 --> 11:52.420
and I worried like the photog sesh on that would be

11:52.420 --> 11:54.420
a little uncomfy.

11:54.420 --> 11:55.620
The optics on that situation are not ideal.

11:55.620 --> 11:56.740
Hey, stand up for me, bud.

11:56.740 --> 11:58.580
Hey, get out of the pool and just like stand,

11:58.580 --> 11:59.540
towel off, bud.

11:59.540 --> 12:00.500
And just like-

12:00.500 --> 12:02.340
No, no, put that dick away.

12:02.340 --> 12:03.540
Hey, can you tooch?

12:03.540 --> 12:04.180
Can you tooch your booch a bit?

12:04.180 --> 12:06.580
Can you tooch your booch and smize your thighs?

12:07.140 --> 12:08.980
And now our interaction is over

12:08.980 --> 12:11.060
and I don't want you to speak to me anymore.

12:11.060 --> 12:14.260
Yeah, I don't actually know you if you could stop, please.

12:14.260 --> 12:16.020
That's the problem is that this woman,

12:16.660 --> 12:20.580
I feel like there is an unspoken law in society

12:20.580 --> 12:23.220
that if you're sneaking a peek, whether it's a picture

12:23.220 --> 12:25.940
or just like scoping someone out of the corner of your eye,

12:25.940 --> 12:29.620
once you are caught, that exchange is done, right?

12:29.620 --> 12:31.540
Well, you can only get so wet.

12:32.340 --> 12:32.980
You know what I mean?

12:32.980 --> 12:33.300
Like-

12:33.300 --> 12:33.940
That's what I'm saying.

12:33.940 --> 12:36.260
But I'm saying that this is like a level of chaos

12:36.260 --> 12:39.780
in society that I'm not willing to accept.

12:39.780 --> 12:41.060
Oh no, don't get me wrong.

12:41.060 --> 12:43.380
It's 24 seven purge out there, Travie.

12:43.380 --> 12:45.940
Okay, because like I saw you do it.

12:45.940 --> 12:47.220
Like I know you're doing it.

12:47.220 --> 12:48.900
I'm looking at you while you're doing it

12:48.900 --> 12:50.020
and you're continuing to do it.

12:50.020 --> 12:50.820
And you're just doing it.

12:50.820 --> 12:54.420
My only recourse, which is to notice you, has been weakened.

12:54.420 --> 12:55.140
Has failed.

12:55.860 --> 12:56.420
Yeah.

12:56.420 --> 12:57.620
So now what am I supposed to do?

12:57.620 --> 12:58.420
Confront you?

12:59.300 --> 12:59.540
What?

13:00.820 --> 13:04.660
That's the other thing is like you didn't say stop, right?

13:04.660 --> 13:06.900
Like you didn't say, hey, cut it out.

13:06.900 --> 13:07.700
Can you stop?

13:07.700 --> 13:09.380
I'm going to have to confiscate that.

13:09.380 --> 13:11.700
And then muting, not muting it is really bad.

13:11.700 --> 13:12.420
This is the thing.

13:12.420 --> 13:14.180
I wanted to touch on this real quick, Griffin.

13:14.180 --> 13:16.660
I want to make a push in 2016.

13:16.660 --> 13:19.940
If we can do nothing else, can we fucking cheese it?

13:19.940 --> 13:22.660
With the camera noise when you take a pic.

13:22.660 --> 13:25.860
I believe that that has never been used to any purpose

13:25.860 --> 13:27.620
other than blowing up your spot.

13:27.620 --> 13:29.380
Can you think of a time you've ever been happy

13:29.380 --> 13:30.420
that that fucker went off?

13:30.420 --> 13:33.060
Or is it like constantly your spot getting blown up

13:33.060 --> 13:33.940
every single time?

13:33.940 --> 13:36.820
Even before phones, we were using digital cameras.

13:36.820 --> 13:40.020
When was the last time a camera made that noise ever?

13:40.020 --> 13:40.900
That's a good point.

13:40.900 --> 13:41.860
It doesn't make that noise.

13:41.860 --> 13:47.060
I was in a toilet stall doing my thing in there,

13:47.060 --> 13:51.860
having practice, having my fun, and I saw something very

13:51.860 --> 13:54.500
funny on my cell phone that I was looking at.

13:55.140 --> 14:00.180
And so I did a screen grab, only when you do a screen grab,

14:00.180 --> 14:01.780
it makes the camera noise.

14:01.780 --> 14:02.500
Thanks, Apple.

14:02.500 --> 14:03.220
Thank you, Apple.

14:03.860 --> 14:08.740
So for the optics on that, or I guess the audio on that

14:08.740 --> 14:11.380
from my neighbor in the other bathroom stall,

14:11.940 --> 14:14.180
so I was having a little photo session in there,

14:14.180 --> 14:15.380
a little photog sesh.

14:15.380 --> 14:18.420
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think you may have told

14:18.420 --> 14:19.300
this story before.

14:19.300 --> 14:21.140
I don't think I have, Travis.

14:21.140 --> 14:23.540
Or maybe it's multiple times this has happened.

14:23.540 --> 14:24.820
Has this happened to you multiple times?

14:24.820 --> 14:25.460
It's probably happened.

14:25.460 --> 14:29.460
I like to save my phone memories, my internet memories

14:29.460 --> 14:31.700
that I have with my Twitter pals.

14:32.260 --> 14:36.900
Last night, I was looking up how to fight a gym in Pokémon Go.

14:38.420 --> 14:41.300
And I screenshotted the instructions and Teresa heard

14:41.300 --> 14:42.980
the camera go and said, oh, what are you taking

14:42.980 --> 14:43.940
a screenshot of?

14:43.940 --> 14:46.660
And you would have thought I was taking a screenshot

14:46.660 --> 14:48.900
of how to kill someone because I was like, oh,

14:48.900 --> 14:50.980
just directions for something.

14:52.820 --> 14:53.380
It's nothing.

14:53.940 --> 14:56.420
We have a neighborhood Facebook group that's actually

14:56.420 --> 14:59.220
been very helpful for certain stuff and a nice little

14:59.220 --> 15:00.340
community bonding thing.

15:00.340 --> 15:02.500
And people have been talking about Pokémon Go all the time.

15:02.500 --> 15:04.180
Apparently, all my neighbors are just going out

15:04.180 --> 15:05.620
for late night Zubat sessions.

15:07.860 --> 15:10.260
Is that that new exercise down at the gym?

15:10.260 --> 15:12.180
Yeah, but it's all adults.

15:12.180 --> 15:13.380
It is not children.

15:13.380 --> 15:15.780
And I'm wondering if we can sort of take Pokémon Go away

15:15.780 --> 15:17.540
from children so I feel a little bit more comfortable

15:17.540 --> 15:20.340
running around catching my EVs and stuff.

15:21.140 --> 15:25.700
I took Charlie out this morning to go look for Pokémon

15:25.700 --> 15:30.420
and she was so excited and I put on her shoes and we just

15:30.420 --> 15:34.020
went out walking and just looking for Pokémon.

15:34.020 --> 15:35.940
I told her that's what we're doing, looking for Pokémon.

15:36.500 --> 15:39.220
And we walked for like 10 minutes without spotting

15:39.220 --> 15:40.260
a single Pokémon.

15:40.260 --> 15:43.620
Every 15 seconds, she's looking up at me like, well,

15:43.620 --> 15:45.060
any Pokémon yet, old man?

15:45.060 --> 15:46.420
I was sold the pillow goods.

15:46.980 --> 15:47.700
Answer's no.

15:47.700 --> 15:50.020
I've never been more fucking humiliated as a dad.

15:50.980 --> 15:52.500
What more embarrassing thing is there?

15:52.500 --> 15:53.700
Like, no, I'm just waiting.

15:53.700 --> 15:57.460
I'm hoping Mimota's song is going to drop me a Pokémon

15:57.460 --> 15:57.860
down here.

15:57.860 --> 15:59.620
Me and my baby girl are going to catch it.

15:59.620 --> 16:00.900
I'm really sorry, sweetheart.

16:02.180 --> 16:03.700
I just pretended because she's a baby.

16:04.260 --> 16:06.660
We saw a squirrel and I was like, oh, come on.

16:08.180 --> 16:08.740
We got one.

16:08.740 --> 16:10.580
That's what she's going to talk in a therapy session

16:10.580 --> 16:12.580
about when she's like 22.

16:12.580 --> 16:13.540
That's more beautiful.

16:13.540 --> 16:15.780
That's like, but this is the fuck thing that I'm saying

16:15.780 --> 16:16.260
to you.

16:16.260 --> 16:19.540
I was looking for digital imaginary Pokémon in my that

16:19.540 --> 16:21.220
only exists in my phone.

16:21.220 --> 16:23.940
And while my daughter and I were like traipsing around

16:23.940 --> 16:25.460
the neighborhood, I saw a squirrel.

16:25.460 --> 16:26.660
I was like, oh, fuck that.

16:26.660 --> 16:27.140
Get out of here.

16:27.140 --> 16:27.860
Get out of here.

16:29.460 --> 16:31.380
Unless you can use quick attack.

16:31.380 --> 16:32.260
Get the fuck out.

16:33.060 --> 16:34.580
You guys want to have some candy?

16:34.580 --> 16:35.780
How about a Yahoo?

16:35.780 --> 16:37.220
Yeah, let me give this Yahoo to you.

16:37.220 --> 16:41.060
Oops, I opened up a best credit cards of 2016.

16:41.060 --> 16:42.180
I opened up an ad.

16:42.740 --> 16:43.780
Well, all right.

16:43.780 --> 16:44.500
Compare cards.

16:44.500 --> 16:46.740
And it's the city simplicity.

16:46.740 --> 16:47.780
No late fees.

16:47.780 --> 16:48.980
Wait a minute.

16:48.980 --> 16:50.500
These are that's a great deal.

16:50.500 --> 16:51.700
I'm going to get on board deal.

16:51.700 --> 16:56.260
You can get a thousand dollars instantly just for signing up.

16:56.260 --> 16:56.820
Holy shit.

16:56.820 --> 16:59.620
I just got somebody just gave me emailed me a thousand bucks.

17:00.500 --> 17:02.020
Man, the Internet is attached.

17:02.020 --> 17:05.700
You see those ads and you think like this is this is they're

17:05.700 --> 17:06.820
trying to grift me.

17:06.820 --> 17:09.300
But no, I just got another thousand.

17:09.300 --> 17:10.100
That's two thousand.

17:10.980 --> 17:12.580
This is by Yahoo Answers user.

17:12.580 --> 17:13.380
They're anonymous.

17:13.380 --> 17:17.380
Let's call them Purvis asks.

17:18.740 --> 17:20.020
Oh, we sent him by level 9000.

17:20.020 --> 17:21.060
Yeah, Drew, Drew, Drew Davenport.

17:21.060 --> 17:21.380
Thank you.

17:21.380 --> 17:25.060
Drew by Yahoo Answers sold me a Nintendo 64.

17:25.060 --> 17:26.020
So I appreciate Drew.

17:26.020 --> 17:26.500
Wow, really?

17:27.780 --> 17:28.260
Any carts?

17:28.260 --> 17:28.900
Any hot carts?

17:29.460 --> 17:30.980
I got the Ocarina of Time.

17:31.780 --> 17:32.660
Oh, nice.

17:32.660 --> 17:34.260
Gold or regular gray?

17:34.820 --> 17:35.460
Just regular.

17:35.460 --> 17:38.980
But I remember my gold version that Justin gave to his ex-girlfriend.

17:38.980 --> 17:39.940
That was fun and cool.

17:41.540 --> 17:47.060
Anyway, was that the same day that you erased my Final Fantasy 7 game?

17:47.060 --> 17:49.940
Yeah, it's a circle of life, the circle of being a shitty brother.

17:51.780 --> 17:54.420
This anonymous user who I have named Purvis asks,

17:54.420 --> 17:57.620
why don't pets need jobs, but humans do?

17:58.660 --> 17:59.860
Good question.

17:59.860 --> 18:01.220
Why don't pets need jobs?

18:01.220 --> 18:04.420
People tell me to get a job, but why can't I be like a pet dog

18:04.420 --> 18:05.860
and sit around all day relaxing?

18:05.860 --> 18:08.100
That's another question that we need to circle back to.

18:08.100 --> 18:10.020
Can anyone explain why pets are excused?

18:10.020 --> 18:12.980
I mostly sit around playing video games or browsing the internet.

18:12.980 --> 18:17.380
I get called useless for not working, but my pet dog gets called adorable.

18:17.380 --> 18:19.540
You never call the pet useless to society.

18:19.540 --> 18:20.180
Why not?

18:20.180 --> 18:22.100
Aren't pets useless to society?

18:22.100 --> 18:22.900
Oh, yeah.

18:22.900 --> 18:25.540
They give humans comfort, but so do I.

18:25.540 --> 18:30.900
I give my parents comfort and I get called mama's boy or childish.

18:30.900 --> 18:34.580
Why do pets get rewarded for doing things humans get shamed for?

18:34.580 --> 18:35.140
Update.

18:35.140 --> 18:37.300
I know it sounds kind of silly, but I'm serious.

18:37.300 --> 18:38.180
Update two.

18:38.180 --> 18:41.460
I know some pets do have jobs like police dogs or service pets,

18:42.020 --> 18:44.420
but most pets don't really do anything except eat, sleep,

18:44.420 --> 18:46.100
go to the bathroom and have fun.

18:46.100 --> 18:46.820
Simple life.

18:48.180 --> 18:50.100
Okay, I want to draw one quick point of order.

18:50.900 --> 18:53.300
Your career aspiration is to be a pet.

18:53.300 --> 18:57.220
I am doubting you're bringing your parents a lot of comfort on the daily.

18:57.220 --> 19:00.740
Maybe some light snuggling or maybe you got them a cold drink,

19:00.740 --> 19:03.220
but on the bigger existential level,

19:03.220 --> 19:07.140
I bet you're providing the absolute opposite of comfort to your parents.

19:07.140 --> 19:08.500
That's an excellent point, Justin.

19:08.500 --> 19:12.660
Are you putting in the comfort work that a dog does every damn day?

19:13.380 --> 19:17.460
Like those dogs are not being comforting 10% of the time.

19:17.460 --> 19:22.500
Can we all agree that this is the prologue to a TLC show about-

19:22.500 --> 19:22.980
I'm a man.

19:22.980 --> 19:24.100
I'm a living-

19:24.100 --> 19:25.380
Hello, I am a man pet.

19:26.020 --> 19:26.340
Yes.

19:27.060 --> 19:29.380
You know, it was just one day I was sitting there and I,

19:29.380 --> 19:32.180
I just realized like this is what I aspire to.

19:32.180 --> 19:36.340
Like why, why do pets get to have all the relaxation fun, you know?

19:36.900 --> 19:39.380
And now I live my life as a comfort dog.

19:39.380 --> 19:40.820
Is there a career opportunity there?

19:40.820 --> 19:42.420
If I ate food,

19:43.540 --> 19:47.780
if I ate the same food every meal and it was relatively inexpensive,

19:47.780 --> 19:50.340
like a kibble, but not a kibble because I, that's gross.

19:51.220 --> 19:55.060
Um, but like, but like, or Luna bars.

19:56.180 --> 19:57.860
If I just ate Luna bars every meal

19:57.860 --> 20:00.500
and you knew just like, let's, we need to get a 36 pack of Luna bars.

20:00.500 --> 20:02.100
This will keep Griffin for a week.

20:02.100 --> 20:03.460
And then I would just like roll up.

20:03.460 --> 20:05.540
You'd feed me a Luna bar three times a day.

20:05.540 --> 20:09.460
And I would just like roll up on the couch and just like put my belly on you.

20:10.820 --> 20:11.380
And that's it.

20:11.380 --> 20:12.740
Like I wouldn't do any, I wouldn't work.

20:12.740 --> 20:14.500
I would just eat my Luna bars.

20:14.500 --> 20:18.820
I would go to, first of all, oh my God, I would beat the shit out of a dog.

20:18.820 --> 20:20.420
First of all, I've been one.

20:20.420 --> 20:21.940
So I know like the tactics.

20:22.660 --> 20:25.540
Second of all, like, if you tell me like, shut the fuck up, we're trying to sleep.

20:25.540 --> 20:26.500
I'd be like, oh, that's cool.

20:26.500 --> 20:26.900
That's cool.

20:26.900 --> 20:27.860
That's cool.

20:27.860 --> 20:30.100
I'm just going to get myself one more Luna bar, an extra one.

20:30.100 --> 20:31.540
Cause I've been a real good boy today.

20:31.540 --> 20:33.140
And I'm also going to go to sleep.

20:33.140 --> 20:34.580
This is a good point.

20:34.580 --> 20:38.580
Cause the thing I like best about my dog is that she is both there

20:38.580 --> 20:41.700
and often non-intrusive to my life.

20:41.700 --> 20:43.300
So she's like there hanging out.

20:43.300 --> 20:47.620
So I know there's like another living being accompanying me through this journey

20:47.620 --> 20:50.020
we call life at all times when I am home.

20:50.580 --> 20:54.020
But also she's not like asking me questions or trying to talk to me

20:54.020 --> 20:55.460
while I'm playing video games.

20:55.460 --> 21:00.180
If I could have that in a human being, just like pay someone to like,

21:00.180 --> 21:04.900
just hang out and keep me safe and bark when someone tries to break into my home.

21:04.900 --> 21:10.020
But also like, they don't need anything from me other than for me to occasionally be like,

21:10.020 --> 21:11.220
who's a good boy?

21:11.220 --> 21:12.340
And then I'm back to overwatch.

21:12.340 --> 21:13.620
See, I can do that too.

21:13.620 --> 21:18.340
Like all I need are my Luna bars and you tell me that I'm looking great today.

21:19.140 --> 21:21.060
I don't know how to break this to you guys,

21:21.060 --> 21:25.780
but there are human beings in this situation and they're called babies, okay?

21:26.340 --> 21:27.780
Babies are in this situation.

21:27.780 --> 21:32.740
We have all of us experienced the exact scenario that is being discussed here

21:32.740 --> 21:35.460
and we decided, okay, I've had my fill.

21:36.340 --> 21:38.020
I want to get my own Luna bars.

21:38.020 --> 21:40.180
I want to go get a job.

21:40.180 --> 21:42.260
It's baffling in hindsight.

21:42.260 --> 21:44.820
We've all made terrible mistakes that have gotten us to this point.

21:44.820 --> 21:46.820
Yeah, it was sick.

21:46.820 --> 21:47.700
It was awesome.

21:47.700 --> 21:48.900
Like, yeah, it was great.

21:48.900 --> 21:50.340
We were all human pets at one point.

21:50.340 --> 21:52.420
Jesus, Justin, you've blown the lid off of this

21:52.420 --> 21:56.020
because I can remember a time when I was like 16, 17, 18

21:56.020 --> 21:58.820
and all I wanted to do was get out there on my own

21:58.820 --> 22:02.020
and own my own way and earn it for myself.

22:02.020 --> 22:03.700
Like that was some trophy.

22:03.700 --> 22:06.740
It was like a lie that had been taught to me for 18 years

22:06.740 --> 22:12.900
that like what I really needed to do was get out from under my parents' wing.

22:12.900 --> 22:14.900
Now all I want to do is get back under there.

22:14.900 --> 22:17.620
If dad could just take care of me forever

22:17.620 --> 22:20.180
while I played video games that didn't have to do shit,

22:20.180 --> 22:22.260
I work a hard life podcasting.

22:22.260 --> 22:22.980
It's exhausting.

22:22.980 --> 22:23.940
This is the important thing though.

22:23.940 --> 22:25.220
You can't play video games.

22:25.220 --> 22:28.100
You have to watch like what dad's watching.

22:28.100 --> 22:28.820
That's the thing.

22:28.820 --> 22:31.780
I guess that's true because Buttercup doesn't get to play video games.

22:31.780 --> 22:33.940
She has to watch goodies when I'm on TV.

22:33.940 --> 22:37.140
But the thing is dad's always watching like Star Trek Deep Space Nine

22:37.140 --> 22:40.020
and now I'm like, yes, feed me my Luna bars

22:40.580 --> 22:42.820
and let's go on a deep space adventure, Nine.

22:45.540 --> 22:47.540
Let's go on our ninth deep space adventure together.

22:47.540 --> 22:49.220
That's fucking, that's, oh man.

22:49.220 --> 22:54.180
Can, is it too late to become an adult baby?

22:55.060 --> 22:59.380
I would need to do some research to figure out where the circles operate

23:00.260 --> 23:01.940
that I can really ingratiate myself

23:01.940 --> 23:03.780
because I feel like I would need to earn a little bit of cred.

23:03.780 --> 23:05.780
So the next time I rolled up like, whoa, Griffin,

23:06.500 --> 23:08.740
you're kind of, you kind of look like an adult baby right now.

23:08.740 --> 23:12.420
I can, I can be like, yes, I've been a member of this circle for a while now.

23:12.420 --> 23:13.620
Respect this.

23:13.620 --> 23:16.260
You have to slow slope into adult baby.

23:16.260 --> 23:20.900
You can't just go from like wearing, you know, a button up and khakis to diaper.

23:21.540 --> 23:25.380
You gotta like, maybe you start wearing a pacifier on a ribbon around your neck.

23:25.380 --> 23:26.980
And people are like, huh?

23:27.540 --> 23:31.540
Okay, that's probably a better option, but I don't know what the first step is.

23:31.540 --> 23:34.580
I don't, I wonder what the supply and demand optics are right now

23:34.580 --> 23:37.540
on like adult team, like adult babies.

23:37.540 --> 23:40.020
Like, is there a lot of positions sitting open

23:40.020 --> 23:42.740
or is it very competitive, do you think?

23:43.540 --> 23:45.300
Well, let me check on Craigslist real quick.

23:45.300 --> 23:46.500
Oh, God. Oh, God.

23:46.500 --> 23:48.340
It's so competitive. Holy shit.

23:49.060 --> 23:49.940
Anything but that.

23:49.940 --> 23:52.980
What, you need three years experience just to apply

23:52.980 --> 23:54.260
for this adult team baby position?

23:54.260 --> 23:56.500
How am I supposed to get the experience of a baby?

23:56.500 --> 23:58.980
Wait a minute, I do have three years experience being a baby.

23:58.980 --> 24:00.340
I have at least seven.

24:00.340 --> 24:02.900
It took me a while to get over the hump.

24:04.660 --> 24:08.660
You know what, I'm, I wasn't body trained until I was seven.

24:08.660 --> 24:09.460
That's not true.

24:10.180 --> 24:11.780
That's just a goof for the podcast.

24:11.780 --> 24:13.700
That's a goof for the podcast.

24:13.700 --> 24:15.700
I was six.

24:16.820 --> 24:18.580
So we were very excited.

24:19.220 --> 24:21.220
I'm gonna jump in here, take a little break

24:21.220 --> 24:22.900
from the old questions.

24:23.780 --> 24:26.660
We're gonna do a pre-money zone, money zone real quick.

24:26.660 --> 24:28.660
Yes, a pre-promo, promo.

24:29.300 --> 24:31.460
If you've ever played the game Monikers

24:31.460 --> 24:32.580
or know of the game Monikers,

24:32.580 --> 24:34.500
you know that it is extremely fun and exciting.

24:34.500 --> 24:35.620
It's one of our favorite games,

24:35.620 --> 24:37.140
one of our favorite party games.

24:37.140 --> 24:39.700
And we are partnering with them to do

24:39.700 --> 24:45.060
my brother and my brother and me slash McElroy collection of Monikers cards,

24:45.060 --> 24:49.140
specifically relating to the McElroy's and McElroy family of shows.

24:50.660 --> 24:52.820
Here's a 30 second rundown on Monikers

24:52.820 --> 24:53.460
if you haven't played it.

24:53.460 --> 24:54.340
It's really, really fun.

24:54.980 --> 24:57.300
Your team draws cards and then you look at your card

24:57.300 --> 24:59.380
and you have to guess, make your teammates guess

24:59.380 --> 25:01.220
what the card says just by talking about it.

25:01.220 --> 25:02.100
That's first round.

25:02.100 --> 25:03.780
Second round, use the same batch of cards,

25:03.780 --> 25:05.380
but you can only say a single word

25:05.380 --> 25:07.140
and you have to get your team to guess it.

25:07.140 --> 25:09.300
And then the third round, you just can use actions,

25:09.300 --> 25:11.060
no words at all to make them guess the word

25:11.060 --> 25:13.460
and whoever gets the most cards after three rounds wins.

25:13.460 --> 25:17.780
And the cards are weighted with extra points for more difficult ones

25:17.780 --> 25:19.540
and easier ones are worth less points.

25:19.540 --> 25:20.180
It's fucking great.

25:20.180 --> 25:22.580
It's a super, super fun game.

25:22.580 --> 25:26.980
And it's, we're really excited because we have,

25:26.980 --> 25:28.900
just to give you an idea, I'm gonna read through a few.

25:28.900 --> 25:30.740
We've got like specific Bim Bam ones,

25:30.740 --> 25:32.980
like Bramble Pelt, Corncob Boy,

25:33.540 --> 25:35.540
Griffin's Ghost Who Wants His Internet History Deleted,

25:35.540 --> 25:37.700
King Nugget, et cetera, Torcy, et cetera.

25:37.700 --> 25:40.740
We've also got general ones that people

25:40.740 --> 25:42.580
who don't listen to the show could do,

25:42.580 --> 25:45.460
like regular size Scott Magula or Mr. Belvedere

25:45.460 --> 25:47.220
or a haunted dollar, Austin Powers, et cetera.

25:47.780 --> 25:51.300
And then we have ones related to some of the other shows

25:51.300 --> 25:53.380
in the McElroy family of podcasts,

25:53.380 --> 25:55.620
like Adventure Zone, Sawbone, Schmanter's,

25:55.620 --> 25:57.300
Trance Like These, Bunker Buddies, Rose Buddies,

25:58.020 --> 26:01.380
and then about people involved with each of those shows.

26:01.380 --> 26:05.060
So there's a ton of cards, I think like 112,

26:05.060 --> 26:06.100
something like that in all.

26:06.100 --> 26:09.620
And we have written the card text for every single one

26:09.620 --> 26:10.420
we wrote ourselves,

26:10.420 --> 26:12.660
which was a significant expenditure of energy,

26:13.220 --> 26:14.420
but it was really fun to do

26:14.420 --> 26:15.700
because we've never done anything like that before.

26:15.700 --> 26:16.740
So that was cool.

26:16.740 --> 26:18.020
Now here's the deal with it.

26:18.020 --> 26:20.260
This is an expansion of monikers.

26:20.260 --> 26:22.420
The base game of monikers, if you have it,

26:22.420 --> 26:25.060
you can buy this expansion and it costs you 10 bucks

26:25.060 --> 26:26.820
and then you can get the whole expansion

26:26.820 --> 26:29.620
in a cool looking package and what all.

26:29.620 --> 26:31.140
If you don't have monikers already,

26:31.140 --> 26:33.300
you can go to McElroyCollection.com,

26:33.300 --> 26:35.540
McElroyCollection.com, singular,

26:35.540 --> 26:36.820
and that's actually where you can pre-order

26:36.820 --> 26:38.580
the expansion as well.

26:38.580 --> 26:40.260
But if you go to McElroyCollection.com,

26:40.260 --> 26:46.260
you can pre-order the card set and also a set of monikers.

26:46.260 --> 26:48.660
So you'll have everything you need to start playing.

26:49.460 --> 26:50.820
You can also play it standalone.

26:51.860 --> 26:53.700
It's more fun with more cards

26:53.700 --> 26:55.380
and the base set has like a ton of cards

26:55.380 --> 26:56.900
and is really fun.

26:56.900 --> 26:58.180
And we should also be clear,

26:58.180 --> 27:01.060
we're only selling this at pre-order at this point.

27:01.060 --> 27:03.300
Once the pre-order is done,

27:03.300 --> 27:05.380
there won't be more orders after that.

27:05.380 --> 27:07.300
We don't have plans to sell it.

27:07.300 --> 27:08.820
Right now, we don't have plans to sell it

27:08.820 --> 27:10.660
as a standalone thing after the pre-order.

27:10.660 --> 27:11.380
The pre-order is gonna be the only way.

27:11.380 --> 27:14.100
We may do a second run way down the road

27:14.100 --> 27:14.900
or something like that.

27:14.900 --> 27:16.900
But for the, like you will not be able to like,

27:18.020 --> 27:19.380
at least the plan currently,

27:19.380 --> 27:20.660
you will not be able to order these.

27:21.380 --> 27:24.900
There'll be 30 days of pre-ordering and then that's it.

27:24.900 --> 27:30.100
And they should be in before Christmas by the holidays.

27:30.100 --> 27:33.860
So like November, possibly October,

27:33.860 --> 27:38.660
but definitely by the holiday shopping season,

27:38.660 --> 27:40.180
you should have them in your hot little hands.

27:40.180 --> 27:42.100
Go to McElroyCollection.com

27:42.100 --> 27:43.060
and at the very least,

27:43.060 --> 27:46.340
check out the amazing art that's going to be up the box.

27:46.340 --> 27:49.220
It makes me very happy every time I look at it.

27:49.220 --> 27:50.580
It's fantastic.

27:50.580 --> 27:51.940
Yeah, it's worth it just to look at that.

27:51.940 --> 27:54.580
McElroyCollection.com, pre-order that.

27:54.580 --> 27:55.620
You have 30 days.

27:55.620 --> 27:56.820
We'll try to remind you a couple of times.

27:56.820 --> 27:58.020
Oh, one other thing.

27:58.020 --> 27:59.780
A portion of sales from this

27:59.780 --> 28:02.020
are gonna go to an organization called Grow Huntington

28:02.020 --> 28:06.100
that actually is an urban farm

28:06.100 --> 28:09.780
that is spinning up here in Huntington

28:09.780 --> 28:15.780
to assist people who are in drug addiction recovery

28:16.660 --> 28:19.300
and are using farming as sort of a therapy

28:19.300 --> 28:20.500
to help them with that.

28:20.500 --> 28:23.220
And that's a really cool organization here in Huntington

28:23.220 --> 28:26.020
and a portion of every sale goes to them.

28:26.020 --> 28:28.420
So you're helping out a good cause too.

28:28.420 --> 28:38.020
Let's go to that money zone.

28:41.620 --> 28:43.780
We're sponsored in part this week by Casper.

28:44.420 --> 28:45.620
We've talked about Casper before.

28:45.620 --> 28:47.220
They make amazing mattresses.

28:47.220 --> 28:48.900
My wife and I sleep on one

28:48.900 --> 28:50.820
and I can't imagine ever going back

28:50.820 --> 28:53.540
to any other form of mattress other than...

28:53.540 --> 28:57.780
I used to sleep on those old like crappy spring mattress things

28:57.780 --> 29:01.060
that dug into you and made sleeping a chore.

29:01.060 --> 29:03.140
Casper makes sleeping a dream

29:03.140 --> 29:05.700
and that's a blurb that they can put on the box.

29:06.420 --> 29:07.540
Like video games.

29:07.540 --> 29:08.100
It's a very...

29:08.100 --> 29:10.100
It's kind of a confusing blurb because like...

29:10.820 --> 29:12.580
Casper makes sleeping a dream?

29:12.580 --> 29:14.340
That's a fucking pull quote, Griffin.

29:14.340 --> 29:15.620
That's amazing.

29:15.620 --> 29:16.260
Are you kidding me?

29:16.980 --> 29:17.700
It's clever.

29:17.700 --> 29:18.260
It's witty.

29:18.260 --> 29:18.980
Okay, it doesn't matter.

29:18.980 --> 29:20.260
It just shows me it's really great.

29:20.260 --> 29:22.420
And they have a risk-free trial and return policy.

29:22.420 --> 29:24.740
You can sleep on a Casper mattress for a hundred days

29:25.540 --> 29:27.060
and then if you don't like it,

29:27.060 --> 29:29.220
there's painless returns and free delivery.

29:29.220 --> 29:31.460
So I highly recommend it.

29:31.460 --> 29:32.580
And I wouldn't just say that

29:32.580 --> 29:34.420
because they are sponsoring the show.

29:34.420 --> 29:36.180
I would say that if anybody asks me

29:36.180 --> 29:37.620
because it's my favorite mattress

29:37.620 --> 29:39.380
I've ever slept on in my entire life.

29:39.380 --> 29:40.420
And because you are my brother,

29:40.420 --> 29:41.380
my brother and me listener,

29:41.380 --> 29:43.940
you can get $50 off towards any mattress,

29:43.940 --> 29:45.700
which are already a great deal

29:45.700 --> 29:46.820
and you're gonna find them cheaper

29:46.820 --> 29:49.700
than any of those big mattress stores

29:49.700 --> 29:51.220
because they cut down on their overhead.

29:51.220 --> 29:52.420
They save you money

29:52.420 --> 29:53.700
and we're gonna save you money.

29:53.700 --> 29:55.540
$50 towards any mattress.

29:55.540 --> 29:58.420
Go to Casper.com slash my brother

29:58.420 --> 30:00.340
and use the promo code mybrother.

30:00.340 --> 30:01.780
All one word at checkout.

30:01.780 --> 30:03.620
Terms and conditions apply.

30:03.620 --> 30:04.820
I wanna tell you about Club W.

30:04.820 --> 30:06.260
Here's my tagline for them.

30:06.260 --> 30:07.940
As long as we're generating these.

30:07.940 --> 30:09.140
Wine is fine.

30:10.020 --> 30:11.220
It's pretty good.

30:11.220 --> 30:14.100
So Club W, what they do is they will send you wine

30:14.100 --> 30:15.860
and they're gonna figure out what kind of wine

30:15.860 --> 30:18.900
is gonna be good for your special snowflake of a tongue

30:19.860 --> 30:21.540
and all the different buds on there.

30:22.900 --> 30:24.420
You fill out a quick little questionnaire

30:24.420 --> 30:25.780
and then based on that,

30:25.780 --> 30:27.140
they figure out what kind of wine you like

30:27.140 --> 30:28.100
and then they send it to you.

30:28.100 --> 30:30.100
Right now, Club W is offering listeners

30:30.100 --> 30:31.780
20 bucks off your first order

30:31.780 --> 30:34.180
when you go to clubw.com slash my brother

30:34.180 --> 30:35.140
and it gets better.

30:35.140 --> 30:36.260
You don't have to pay for shipping.

30:36.260 --> 30:37.300
They'll pay for your shipping

30:37.300 --> 30:39.300
on orders of four bottles or more

30:39.300 --> 30:41.460
and of course you're gonna order four bottles.

30:41.460 --> 30:42.420
What's the point getting like,

30:42.420 --> 30:44.260
I'm gonna order one bottle off the inner,

30:44.260 --> 30:45.700
oops, it's all gone.

30:45.700 --> 30:48.020
I watched a single episode of The Bachelorette

30:48.020 --> 30:50.020
and I drank all my wine, dang it.

30:50.020 --> 30:51.380
Because I needed it.

30:51.380 --> 30:53.220
I needed it to get through this show.

30:53.220 --> 30:54.420
I was just gonna say that that's not

30:54.420 --> 30:55.700
because I don't like The Bachelorette.

30:55.700 --> 30:57.380
It's just an extreme intense show.

30:57.380 --> 30:58.020
I just wanted to make that clear.

30:58.020 --> 30:59.300
No, yeah, you need something.

30:59.300 --> 31:01.380
I don't want another fish gate happening.

31:02.100 --> 31:03.380
Just take something off your to-do list.

31:03.380 --> 31:05.220
Go to clubw.com slash my brother.

31:05.220 --> 31:07.140
Get 20 bucks off your first order right now.

31:07.140 --> 31:10.100
That's clubw.com slash my brother.

31:10.980 --> 31:13.460
I got a personal message for us.

31:15.460 --> 31:18.500
It's from McDrunk who says,

31:18.500 --> 31:20.820
hi guys, thanks for the goose.

31:20.820 --> 31:22.020
Now this is a short message

31:22.020 --> 31:24.100
so I wanna make sure you actually get every word right

31:24.100 --> 31:25.620
because it's actually, hey guys.

31:25.620 --> 31:26.180
Hey guys.

31:26.180 --> 31:26.420
Thanks for the goose.

31:26.420 --> 31:28.500
There were six words and you blew one.

31:28.500 --> 31:29.620
You did screw up one of them.

31:29.620 --> 31:32.180
That's like an 18.6% repeating.

31:32.740 --> 31:34.100
But since the message is to us,

31:34.100 --> 31:35.300
we've already consumed it.

31:36.580 --> 31:37.220
I mean, it's there.

31:37.220 --> 31:38.100
Oh, you're right.

31:38.100 --> 31:39.300
We shouldn't have read this out loud.

31:39.300 --> 31:40.340
This was just for us.

31:40.340 --> 31:41.780
This is a private message.

31:42.580 --> 31:47.140
This is a $100 DM that was sent to us by McDrunk.

31:47.140 --> 31:49.540
Honestly, we should put a breathalyzer on the Jumbotron.

31:49.540 --> 31:50.820
We absolutely, oh my God.

31:50.820 --> 31:54.260
It would cut the number down by at least 70%.

31:54.260 --> 31:56.820
Which would be good for us actually.

31:56.820 --> 31:57.940
Especially when you consider that

31:57.940 --> 31:59.780
we're sold out six months in advance.

32:00.340 --> 32:03.860
McDrunk probably bought this in January.

32:03.860 --> 32:06.660
They've probably been dreading this moment for half a year.

32:07.220 --> 32:07.460
Yeah.

32:08.180 --> 32:10.820
Hey, congratulations on the confrontation

32:10.820 --> 32:12.260
of your darkest demons.

32:12.260 --> 32:16.020
I have a message, another one for AJ Cluck.

32:16.580 --> 32:18.500
And it is from D Money.

32:18.500 --> 32:21.940
And it says, for the McElroy brothers,

32:21.940 --> 32:24.100
thank you for making my favorite person laugh

32:24.100 --> 32:26.020
with your internet chit chat.

32:26.020 --> 32:28.900
You are blessed to have his precious Canadian ears

32:28.900 --> 32:29.860
listening every week.

32:29.860 --> 32:30.660
I thank you very much.

32:31.300 --> 32:35.060
For AJ, you are the absolute coolest.

32:35.060 --> 32:36.820
Thanks for being my best friend.

32:36.820 --> 32:38.180
Happy fake Valentine's day.

32:38.980 --> 32:40.820
Oh yeah, 7-11.

32:40.820 --> 32:42.900
The fake Valentine's day every year.

32:43.460 --> 32:45.700
That or we beefed it on the timing.

32:45.700 --> 32:48.100
So maybe the baddest we've ever beefed.

32:48.100 --> 32:49.540
Yeah, we're like at the inverse.

32:49.540 --> 32:51.460
We're very, very far off.

32:51.460 --> 32:52.340
It's hate day.

32:52.340 --> 32:54.260
What's the opposite of Valentine's day?

32:54.260 --> 32:55.140
Six months later.

32:56.020 --> 32:57.780
Here's some butt chocolates.

32:57.780 --> 32:58.980
I don't even know what those are.

33:01.540 --> 33:03.060
Here's some, here's some nails.

33:03.860 --> 33:05.460
Here's some cigarette butts

33:05.460 --> 33:07.700
in a nice decorative heart shaped box.

33:08.740 --> 33:11.780
Um, so good for all that.

33:11.780 --> 33:13.540
For both of you, AJ and D Money.

33:14.100 --> 33:16.420
May you live happily ever after, I guess.

33:16.420 --> 33:18.020
Hey guys, this is Adam Conover.

33:18.020 --> 33:19.700
You may know me from my true TV show,

33:19.700 --> 33:20.740
Adam Ruins Everything.

33:20.740 --> 33:21.540
Well, guess what?

33:21.540 --> 33:23.140
Now we're doing a podcast version

33:23.140 --> 33:24.740
right here on Maximum Fun.

33:24.740 --> 33:26.500
What we do is we take all the interesting,

33:26.500 --> 33:28.020
fascinating experts that we talked to

33:28.020 --> 33:29.460
for just a couple of minutes on the show

33:29.460 --> 33:31.940
and we sit with them for an entire podcast,

33:31.940 --> 33:33.380
really going deep and getting into

33:33.380 --> 33:35.700
the fascinating details of their work.

33:35.700 --> 33:36.900
Find Adam Ruins Everything

33:36.900 --> 33:38.340
wherever you get your podcasts

33:38.340 --> 33:39.940
or at MaximumFun.org.

33:41.220 --> 33:43.620
We are now going to share with you

33:43.620 --> 33:45.220
our interview with guestpert,

33:45.220 --> 33:46.740
Patrick Rothfuss.

33:46.740 --> 33:48.820
Even if you aren't familiar with his work,

33:48.820 --> 33:50.340
I think you're really going to enjoy it.

33:50.340 --> 33:53.380
There's a lot of interesting discussion

33:53.380 --> 33:55.780
about parenthood and creating stories

33:55.780 --> 33:58.340
and he's just a really cool fella

33:58.340 --> 33:59.620
and we really enjoy talking with him

33:59.620 --> 34:01.540
and I think you're going to enjoy that.

34:02.100 --> 34:03.620
But we will be back with you

34:03.620 --> 34:04.580
right after that interview,

34:04.580 --> 34:07.060
which is taking away us from four days ago.

34:07.060 --> 34:09.060
I'm very excited, ladies and gentlemen,

34:09.060 --> 34:11.060
to introduce our guest,

34:11.060 --> 34:14.180
our special guestpert on this episode.

34:14.180 --> 34:17.940
I've been a fan for many, many years of his work

34:17.940 --> 34:19.620
to the point where my friends and I

34:19.620 --> 34:22.900
would have like conspiracy theory level discussions

34:22.900 --> 34:25.700
on what we thought was going on in the stories.

34:25.700 --> 34:27.620
And I know that that is not uncommon.

34:27.620 --> 34:29.940
We are joined this week by,

34:29.940 --> 34:31.140
I'm going to say at this point,

34:31.140 --> 34:33.540
I'm just going to go ahead and say legendary author,

34:33.540 --> 34:34.820
Patrick Rothfuss,

34:34.820 --> 34:36.500
author of the Kingkiller Chronicles

34:37.300 --> 34:39.700
and regular fixture on the

34:40.420 --> 34:41.380
Dungeons and Dragons,

34:41.380 --> 34:42.820
Wizards of the Coast podcast,

34:42.820 --> 34:44.900
Acquisitions Incorporated member,

34:44.900 --> 34:47.860
just general kind of cool internet nerd dude.

34:47.860 --> 34:48.660
Welcome, Patrick.

34:48.660 --> 34:49.220
Hey there.

34:49.220 --> 34:52.580
Sorry to try to feel the need to label you like that.

34:52.580 --> 34:53.060
Jeez.

34:53.060 --> 34:54.020
Yeah, jeez.

34:54.020 --> 34:56.180
I just, I like to know who my people are at any given,

34:56.180 --> 34:57.220
it makes me feel safer.

34:57.220 --> 35:00.420
I will say I am more comfortable with internet nerd

35:00.420 --> 35:03.220
than legendary fantasy author.

35:03.220 --> 35:03.780
Yeah.

35:03.780 --> 35:04.740
Now-

35:04.740 --> 35:07.060
Legendary makes me feel like a little bit of a collectible.

35:07.060 --> 35:08.580
Master of the quill.

35:08.580 --> 35:13.540
Patrick, a quick Google of you,

35:14.900 --> 35:17.300
according to Google,

35:17.300 --> 35:18.820
you are influenced by,

35:18.820 --> 35:20.820
and these are the only two it says,

35:20.820 --> 35:22.820
William Shakespeare and George R.R. Martin.

35:22.820 --> 35:23.940
So is that about sum it up?

35:25.140 --> 35:25.460
You know-

35:25.460 --> 35:26.900
Is it just those two?

35:26.900 --> 35:28.340
If I was, yeah, that's pretty much,

35:28.340 --> 35:30.020
those are the only two things I've ever read.

35:31.300 --> 35:32.980
I'm going to squish these bad boys together,

35:32.980 --> 35:33.620
see what happens.

35:33.620 --> 35:36.260
You got your George R.R. Martin in my Shakespeare.

35:36.260 --> 35:38.500
You got your Shakespeare in my George R.R. Martin.

35:38.500 --> 35:41.300
Yeah, pretty much just the histories of Shakespeare

35:41.300 --> 35:44.740
and only the second and the fourth Martin books.

35:45.780 --> 35:48.180
Did it make as much sense as if you had just read them

35:48.180 --> 35:49.140
from the beginning?

35:49.140 --> 35:51.300
I wonder what metric,

35:51.300 --> 35:55.620
what weird fucking Google thing pulled up those

35:55.620 --> 35:56.900
as my influences.

35:56.900 --> 35:58.740
Like how the hell did that happen?

35:58.740 --> 36:01.140
It does say, I will say it says comma more.

36:01.140 --> 36:03.940
So there are other-

36:03.940 --> 36:05.780
Also Judy Blume.

36:05.780 --> 36:06.280
Yeah.

36:07.620 --> 36:09.380
Patrick, we have a big list of questions here.

36:09.380 --> 36:10.340
Travis, you curated these.

36:10.340 --> 36:14.740
How many jerks did we get asking about book three

36:14.740 --> 36:16.580
and did you put those jerks in the garbage?

36:16.580 --> 36:17.220
I did.

36:17.220 --> 36:18.500
I threw those jerks right away.

36:18.500 --> 36:20.660
I burned them off the internet like a wart.

36:21.300 --> 36:23.620
So we won't have to worry about that anymore.

36:23.620 --> 36:24.820
All the questions,

36:24.820 --> 36:28.020
we asked you some topics you felt comfortable giving advice on

36:28.020 --> 36:29.460
and you just kind of went with it.

36:29.460 --> 36:31.300
I felt comfortable giving advice on

36:31.300 --> 36:34.020
and you said storytelling and parenting.

36:34.900 --> 36:38.820
So we've got an interesting grab bag of those two sets.

36:38.820 --> 36:39.700
Let's start off.

36:39.700 --> 36:43.620
We've had to start putting those expertise areas out there

36:43.620 --> 36:46.820
because I think we had like Elizabeth Gilbert,

36:46.820 --> 36:48.580
author of Eat, Pray, Love on the show,

36:49.540 --> 36:50.500
dear friend of the family.

36:51.060 --> 36:53.780
And everybody's like, my garbage disposal is broken.

36:53.780 --> 36:54.820
How do I fix it?

36:56.820 --> 36:58.660
Oh man, I really missed out.

36:58.660 --> 37:01.300
Did we in turn go ahead and ask her that question?

37:02.020 --> 37:04.340
I mean, we could have at any point stepped in

37:04.340 --> 37:05.620
and not done that.

37:05.620 --> 37:07.460
Listen, there were a lot of steps in that process

37:07.460 --> 37:08.260
that we fucked up.

37:09.380 --> 37:10.260
We did bad.

37:10.260 --> 37:11.140
We get that.

37:11.140 --> 37:12.100
We get that now.

37:12.100 --> 37:14.420
And now Elizabeth Gilbert won't talk to us anymore.

37:14.420 --> 37:16.180
I understand that we did bad.

37:16.180 --> 37:17.380
But here's the first question.

37:18.100 --> 37:19.300
I've never held a baby

37:19.300 --> 37:21.460
and me and my wife are trying to conceive.

37:21.460 --> 37:24.420
I'm genuinely worried that I'm going to hold the baby wrong.

37:24.420 --> 37:26.900
What would be the best way to hold a newborn in your opinion?

37:26.900 --> 37:28.660
That's from Nathan and Yukon

37:28.660 --> 37:31.780
and like two of the three brothers on this show right now.

37:31.780 --> 37:32.980
Yeah, also, yes.

37:33.780 --> 37:37.620
Oh, are you like gearing up for babying?

37:37.620 --> 37:38.020
Yeah.

37:38.020 --> 37:39.380
Travis and I are both,

37:39.380 --> 37:40.660
and with our respective wives,

37:40.660 --> 37:41.700
we are both expecting.

37:41.700 --> 37:42.980
We're not expecting with each other

37:42.980 --> 37:46.500
in some sort of weird incestuous junior situation.

37:48.660 --> 37:50.420
It's worth noting, Patrick, before you hop in,

37:50.420 --> 37:51.860
I do have a two-year-old

37:51.860 --> 37:53.860
so they could have fucking asked me at any point,

37:53.860 --> 37:54.900
but that's fine.

37:54.900 --> 37:57.940
You know, here's the thing, we're grown ass adults, Joseph.

37:57.940 --> 37:59.300
Patrick Roth is on the show

37:59.300 --> 38:00.580
and he'll tell you how to hold a baby.

38:00.580 --> 38:01.700
We're grown ass adults

38:01.700 --> 38:04.020
and sometimes it's really disheartening

38:04.020 --> 38:05.460
and kind of embarrassing to go,

38:05.460 --> 38:07.300
how do I hold a tiny human?

38:08.500 --> 38:09.220
So how do you?

38:09.220 --> 38:10.900
The thing is, I will say,

38:10.900 --> 38:12.420
actually, I'm going to come to your defense.

38:14.100 --> 38:16.100
Generally speaking, there's not a community

38:17.540 --> 38:20.740
of guys talking about being dads.

38:20.740 --> 38:24.180
You know, culturally, women get together.

38:24.180 --> 38:27.380
It's valued in the culture.

38:27.380 --> 38:29.380
Women feel free to ask these questions,

38:29.380 --> 38:30.660
share information,

38:30.660 --> 38:32.900
but it's not a typical dude thing.

38:32.900 --> 38:36.020
Now, what I've discovered is that geek dudes,

38:36.900 --> 38:39.140
we like to do everything to the best of our ability

38:39.140 --> 38:40.740
and we like to mine for data.

38:41.300 --> 38:43.380
And so we're an interesting subsection

38:43.380 --> 38:44.660
of the population.

38:45.780 --> 38:49.940
And so there is a lot of geek dad talk.

38:49.940 --> 38:52.980
But anyway, with holding a baby and here,

38:52.980 --> 38:57.860
I'm sorry, this will be irritatingly frank advice,

38:57.860 --> 38:59.700
which is kind of boring.

38:59.700 --> 39:02.820
But the most important thing is to get in there

39:03.380 --> 39:05.220
because the baby's going to get born.

39:05.700 --> 39:06.900
You're going to be freaked out

39:07.620 --> 39:09.460
and you're going to be thinking

39:09.460 --> 39:11.140
exactly what everybody thinks.

39:11.140 --> 39:13.140
They're going to be like, oh no, I'm going to fuck it up.

39:13.140 --> 39:16.260
It's, this is such a like essential part of it,

39:16.260 --> 39:18.500
but this is one area in which

39:18.500 --> 39:24.100
like I think we have it not great off.

39:24.100 --> 39:26.100
And that is that parenting books

39:26.100 --> 39:28.660
and like baby books aimed at dudes

39:28.660 --> 39:32.420
are almost invariably the fucking pits.

39:32.420 --> 39:34.660
Like without any useful information whatsoever,

39:34.660 --> 39:36.260
the stuff in these books is like,

39:36.260 --> 39:38.100
make sure to build yourself a man cave

39:38.100 --> 39:39.540
that the baby's not allowed in,

39:39.540 --> 39:41.220
that you put all your football trophies.

39:41.220 --> 39:42.980
In dudes you're getting a dad,

39:42.980 --> 39:44.980
the book that I read and encouraged you,

39:44.980 --> 39:46.980
it said you probably have a hard time connecting

39:46.980 --> 39:48.260
with your unborn baby.

39:48.260 --> 39:50.660
And it suggested drawing football plays

39:50.660 --> 39:52.260
on your pregnant wife's stomach

39:52.260 --> 39:54.260
and explaining them to the fetus

39:54.260 --> 39:57.700
to encourage some sort of basic human connection.

39:57.700 --> 39:59.140
And I'm like, and I'm like,

39:59.140 --> 40:03.060
which bones in there do I need to not touch

40:03.060 --> 40:04.580
because they're crazy baby bones

40:04.580 --> 40:05.540
and they're super weak.

40:05.540 --> 40:07.460
And if I touch it while holding it wrong,

40:07.460 --> 40:08.660
like I lose.

40:08.660 --> 40:10.260
Well, I think what Patrick is saying,

40:10.260 --> 40:12.340
if I might paraphrase,

40:12.340 --> 40:14.660
there's no wrong way to hold a baby.

40:14.660 --> 40:20.980
Well, no, no, actually what I will say,

40:20.980 --> 40:22.980
and as you will quickly learn,

40:22.980 --> 40:26.340
I lack the ability to make simple declarative statements.

40:26.340 --> 40:29.060
Every question that I respond to,

40:29.060 --> 40:30.980
if not everything that I fucking say

40:31.700 --> 40:32.980
ends up being a little story.

40:32.980 --> 40:33.940
So here's the story.

40:35.060 --> 40:37.300
I'm in the delivery room.

40:37.300 --> 40:39.700
I've been on team baby.

40:39.700 --> 40:41.940
I've been minding my position, right?

40:41.940 --> 40:43.860
Because in the delivery room,

40:43.860 --> 40:46.180
you are not the fucking captain of the ship

40:46.180 --> 40:47.620
and you are not the first mate.

40:48.180 --> 40:50.020
And you're just, you're like way down.

40:50.020 --> 40:53.060
You're the poor orphan that's stowed away

40:53.060 --> 40:54.820
in the basement of the ship,

40:55.700 --> 40:59.460
hiding in a discarded gin barrel,

40:59.460 --> 41:00.660
hoping you're not discovered.

41:01.460 --> 41:02.980
Just trying to get to the new world.

41:03.780 --> 41:05.780
At best, you're some sort of bosun,

41:05.780 --> 41:07.300
you know, like Gideon Forsen.

41:09.060 --> 41:10.820
And so baby gets born

41:10.820 --> 41:14.100
and I have an amazing midwife there

41:14.100 --> 41:16.900
who's helping out, which is a whole different story.

41:16.900 --> 41:18.100
You know, because the first thing is

41:18.100 --> 41:19.460
you gotta cut the umbilical cord

41:19.460 --> 41:21.380
and she goes and she hands me the scissors.

41:22.500 --> 41:25.300
And I'm like, oh no, I'm fine.

41:25.300 --> 41:26.660
This has been a great experience.

41:26.660 --> 41:28.660
I'm full of all sorts of emotions,

41:29.540 --> 41:31.620
but like, you know how to do this

41:31.620 --> 41:33.460
and I'm a fucking idiot.

41:33.460 --> 41:36.260
So how about you use the surgical implement

41:36.260 --> 41:37.380
and I will just stand here.

41:38.100 --> 41:40.340
And she handed it to me and she goes,

41:40.340 --> 41:40.900
do it.

41:41.860 --> 41:42.900
And so I did it.

41:42.900 --> 41:44.500
You know, and I'm like, okay, I did it.

41:44.500 --> 41:46.100
She was right about my capabilities.

41:46.100 --> 41:46.900
I could do this.

41:47.620 --> 41:49.700
First thing, of course, you get the baby

41:49.700 --> 41:51.220
on the mom's chest.

41:51.220 --> 41:53.140
So the baby gets skin to skin contact,

41:53.140 --> 41:53.700
super important.

41:55.700 --> 41:57.460
And then after a little bit,

41:58.740 --> 42:00.020
I did get a chance.

42:00.580 --> 42:03.460
And what I said was, oh no, no, that's okay.

42:03.460 --> 42:04.980
Let's get a bunch of that skin to skin.

42:04.980 --> 42:06.420
Let's leave the baby on the mom.

42:06.420 --> 42:09.140
But all I was doing was like, I don't know.

42:09.140 --> 42:10.500
I don't want to do it wrong.

42:10.500 --> 42:11.140
That's the fear.

42:12.180 --> 42:14.980
And so she said, do it.

42:14.980 --> 42:17.140
And she puts the baby in my arms

42:17.140 --> 42:18.180
and I'm super careful.

42:19.060 --> 42:21.300
And that's how I started doing it.

42:21.300 --> 42:22.420
And the more you do it,

42:22.420 --> 42:23.460
the better you get at it.

42:24.020 --> 42:26.260
But you can't start getting good at it

42:26.260 --> 42:27.060
until you start.

42:27.060 --> 42:29.300
And so you got to start like fucking hour one.

42:29.860 --> 42:32.580
Get in there, hold it, and then you'll start.

42:32.580 --> 42:37.060
You'll be a fucking pro inside of three months.

42:37.060 --> 42:38.580
You'll learn the upside down.

42:38.580 --> 42:39.940
You'll learn the leg over the top.

42:39.940 --> 42:41.460
You'll learn the backwards.

42:41.460 --> 42:43.780
You'll learn if you lay them on the left hand side,

42:43.780 --> 42:44.820
they fart better.

42:44.820 --> 42:45.380
Yeah.

42:45.380 --> 42:46.180
What really?

42:46.180 --> 42:47.620
Does that work for adults too?

42:49.140 --> 42:53.220
See, skin to skin was your first mistake, Patrick.

42:53.220 --> 42:55.060
You got to go skin to football.

42:55.060 --> 42:57.620
I had my baby on a football.

42:58.340 --> 42:59.700
The moment she was born,

42:59.700 --> 43:02.020
she was lying on a football just to get that connection

43:02.020 --> 43:04.660
between her and football, which I love so much.

43:04.660 --> 43:06.420
I was, of course, referring to a pigskin.

43:06.420 --> 43:07.220
A pigskin.

43:07.220 --> 43:08.020
Fantastic.

43:08.020 --> 43:09.140
Fantastic.

43:09.140 --> 43:09.620
Very good.

43:09.620 --> 43:10.100
Naturally.

43:10.100 --> 43:10.500
It's good.

43:10.500 --> 43:13.780
You can do the skin to skin as a dad too.

43:13.780 --> 43:14.900
Don't be afraid, guys.

43:14.900 --> 43:15.860
Take that shirt off.

43:15.860 --> 43:16.980
Get some skin to skin going.

43:16.980 --> 43:17.300
It's good.

43:17.300 --> 43:19.780
No matter what the doctor or midwife says.

43:19.780 --> 43:20.260
Yeah.

43:20.260 --> 43:21.460
But I mean, not right away.

43:21.460 --> 43:23.460
You can do skin to skin for a long time.

43:24.100 --> 43:24.500
Yeah.

43:24.500 --> 43:28.660
And honestly, I mean, here's your interesting science fact.

43:30.020 --> 43:33.460
If you put the baby on the mom, if the baby is too hot,

43:33.460 --> 43:37.540
the skin to skin contact, the mom's body will regulate

43:37.540 --> 43:38.980
the baby's body temperature.

43:38.980 --> 43:39.780
That's babies.

43:40.420 --> 43:41.780
Crazy babies, too.

43:41.780 --> 43:42.340
It is.

43:42.340 --> 43:45.860
This is fucking like this is why we've survived as a species.

43:45.860 --> 43:46.900
The baby's too cold.

43:46.900 --> 43:50.580
The mama actually heats up and warms up the baby.

43:50.580 --> 43:52.660
But here's the here's the tricky bit.

43:52.660 --> 43:56.980
If the baby is too hot, the mom's body cools down to bring

43:56.980 --> 43:58.820
the baby's body temperature down.

43:58.820 --> 43:59.460
What?

43:59.460 --> 44:00.020
Yeah.

44:00.020 --> 44:00.500
Yeah.

44:00.500 --> 44:02.260
What does my body do?

44:02.260 --> 44:06.500
And here's you get you get half of that.

44:06.500 --> 44:06.900
Okay.

44:06.900 --> 44:11.540
You're not, you know, you're not, you know, Wolverine.

44:11.540 --> 44:13.220
You don't get the full suite of powers.

44:13.220 --> 44:15.700
But you're like Dazzler, right?

44:17.140 --> 44:20.260
You know, where if you have the baby on your chest, you know,

44:20.260 --> 44:24.660
skin to skin, if the baby is too cold, a dad's body will warm

44:24.660 --> 44:26.020
up and warm up the baby.

44:26.020 --> 44:28.740
But you don't get the other side where you can cool it down.

44:28.740 --> 44:29.700
So it's half.

44:30.340 --> 44:31.140
Dads aren't cool.

44:31.140 --> 44:32.420
You heard it here first.

44:32.420 --> 44:35.220
Well, I think we all knew that already.

44:36.020 --> 44:37.780
Can I read one off this list?

44:37.780 --> 44:38.420
Yes.

44:38.420 --> 44:39.140
We got a bunch.

44:39.140 --> 44:41.140
And I really only want to hear about the stuff that's

44:41.700 --> 44:43.060
interesting to me.

44:43.060 --> 44:47.060
That's a pro interviewer tip that I learned from Barbara Walters

44:47.060 --> 44:48.580
is the one who does the interviews.

44:50.580 --> 44:54.020
I've been slowly building a world for use in DMing or maybe

44:54.020 --> 44:56.820
try my hand at writing short stories when it comes to creating

44:56.820 --> 44:58.100
a world from scratch.

44:58.100 --> 45:01.620
What was your first step or maybe baseline, i.e. geography,

45:01.620 --> 45:04.020
religion, world events, Brian?

45:04.020 --> 45:04.580
Oh, I'm sorry.

45:04.580 --> 45:06.180
Brian is the person who has that.

45:06.180 --> 45:07.780
You got to get a good Brian in there.

45:07.780 --> 45:09.540
And then you sort of spiral out from there.

45:09.540 --> 45:14.580
I think a lot of people are looking for a recipe, which is

45:14.580 --> 45:15.460
very understandable.

45:15.460 --> 45:18.340
You're kind of you want to do a good job at this thing.

45:18.340 --> 45:21.540
And so you're like, how do you make a good fantasy world?

45:22.260 --> 45:26.100
And what happens a lot of times is people look to the classics.

45:26.100 --> 45:30.020
You look to Tolkien because he's like granddaddy.

45:30.020 --> 45:31.940
Tolkien has this.

45:33.220 --> 45:35.860
His shadow is long over the fantasy world.

45:36.660 --> 45:40.660
And and so people look at that and they go, OK, you need a

45:40.660 --> 45:41.540
bunch of poetry.

45:41.540 --> 45:43.460
You need a bunch of fake languages.

45:43.460 --> 45:45.300
You need mythology.

45:45.300 --> 45:49.140
You need a big history that goes back 5000 years.

45:50.020 --> 45:51.060
But here's the thing.

45:51.780 --> 45:55.460
That's not what makes a good fantasy world or a good world

45:55.460 --> 45:56.820
of whatever sort you're creating.

45:57.460 --> 46:01.540
What made that good is that Tolkien was a huge geek for all

46:01.540 --> 46:02.660
of those things.

46:02.660 --> 46:07.060
He studied the like Norse Edda's and he was a linguistics

46:07.060 --> 46:09.540
nut and he loved history.

46:10.180 --> 46:13.220
And so, of course, all of those things that he was super

46:13.220 --> 46:17.700
passionate about informed the world that he was creating.

46:18.740 --> 46:21.460
But odds are, you are not all of those things.

46:21.460 --> 46:25.620
So if you try to follow Tolkien's recipe, you're just not going

46:25.620 --> 46:29.380
to know as much about those things and you won't be as

46:29.380 --> 46:30.260
excited about them.

46:30.260 --> 46:32.500
And that passion won't show up in the world you're making.

46:33.060 --> 46:37.060
So generally speaking, I mean, in my world, there's a lot

46:37.060 --> 46:40.180
about economy and about coinage and money.

46:40.180 --> 46:42.820
And that's because I'm kind of a geek for that stuff.

46:43.380 --> 46:46.660
There's a lot about like religion and philosophy because

46:46.660 --> 46:47.780
I'm kind of a geek for that.

46:47.780 --> 46:51.540
Some sociology and psychology, a lot of hard science because

46:51.540 --> 46:53.140
I was almost a chemical engineer.

46:54.660 --> 46:58.980
Those things, you know, are what kind of make the cornerstones

46:58.980 --> 47:00.020
of my world.

47:00.020 --> 47:02.820
But nobody ever says, where's all your elf poetry, Rothfuss,

47:02.820 --> 47:03.940
because you need that.

47:03.940 --> 47:04.440
Yeah.

47:05.300 --> 47:06.820
Well, at least not to your face.

47:07.620 --> 47:08.900
Not to my face, right?

47:08.900 --> 47:13.300
Whenever I start reading a new fantasy series, I'm always

47:13.300 --> 47:16.500
impressed that it always seems like they put so much thought

47:16.500 --> 47:19.540
into how magic works in their specific world.

47:20.260 --> 47:22.740
Is that a good, because that's one of my favorite things

47:22.740 --> 47:26.260
about the Kingkiller Chronicles is like the explanation of

47:26.260 --> 47:30.740
sympathy and like how magic works specifically in the world

47:30.740 --> 47:32.020
you've created.

47:32.020 --> 47:35.060
Is that a good base point for a fantasy writer or is that

47:35.060 --> 47:37.460
something that comes out of the world you've built?

47:39.060 --> 47:41.380
It definitely has a big impact on the world.

47:41.940 --> 47:46.100
And if you are interested in it and if you like it, you can

47:46.100 --> 47:49.140
you like it, then absolutely you should you should do that.

47:49.700 --> 47:53.700
It's really interesting to note that Tolkien doesn't do any

47:53.700 --> 47:57.540
of that, you know, and like those books are fairly

47:57.540 --> 47:58.100
successful.

47:59.940 --> 48:02.500
And but think about it, like, what do you know about what

48:02.500 --> 48:03.380
Gandalf can do?

48:05.140 --> 48:08.100
He can blow a smoke ring and then put a ship in it, I think.

48:09.300 --> 48:09.780
Right.

48:09.780 --> 48:11.220
Well, that's not that's not magic.

48:11.220 --> 48:14.340
Like, look at any vape tricks compilation video that goes

48:14.340 --> 48:16.740
viral on Facebook and like people are doing way crazier

48:16.740 --> 48:17.460
shit than that now.

48:18.900 --> 48:23.540
But like he like actually Gandalf is kind of crap in terms

48:23.540 --> 48:24.740
of the magic department.

48:24.740 --> 48:26.420
You look at the Hobbit, what does he do?

48:26.420 --> 48:30.340
He like makes a couple of like flashes and sets pine cones

48:30.340 --> 48:30.980
on fire.

48:30.980 --> 48:31.620
Big deal.

48:31.620 --> 48:32.500
I could do that.

48:32.500 --> 48:35.220
But there's no big magic system there.

48:36.100 --> 48:38.260
You may have just ruined those books for me because I'm

48:38.260 --> 48:40.580
thinking back at like all this stuff like, wait, he turned

48:40.580 --> 48:42.100
gray and then he turned white.

48:42.100 --> 48:44.900
What did? Why? Why did that?

48:44.900 --> 48:46.020
Why did he do this?

48:46.020 --> 48:46.820
Why did this happen?

48:47.380 --> 48:50.980
Yeah, he not he had a there was a big monster coming at him

48:50.980 --> 48:52.500
and the Balrog, you know what he did?

48:52.500 --> 48:54.020
He knocked himself off a bridge.

48:54.020 --> 48:55.220
He broke a bridge he was on.

48:55.220 --> 48:55.860
Good job.

48:55.860 --> 48:57.140
Good magic, bud.

48:57.140 --> 48:57.780
Good magic.

48:57.780 --> 48:59.460
Get your shit together Gandalf, geez.

48:59.460 --> 49:00.900
Yeah, do something.

49:00.900 --> 49:03.380
Hey, Patrick, I understand starting a fantasy world with

49:03.380 --> 49:05.380
what I like, but what if I only like garbage?

49:05.380 --> 49:07.700
I can't very well build a fantasy world about discontinued

49:07.700 --> 49:09.460
cereals, which is the only thing I'm interested in.

49:09.460 --> 49:14.180
You know, I would argue that I would I would love I would

49:14.180 --> 49:18.340
maybe not a fantasy world, but I could see a dystopian future.

49:18.340 --> 49:19.700
Yeah, or that's the currency.

49:20.500 --> 49:21.300
Yeah, it's three.

49:21.300 --> 49:22.260
See, there you go.

49:22.260 --> 49:24.580
Three crunch berries to a to a boo berry.

49:26.580 --> 49:28.260
I can't tell if Justin's joking or not because we've been

49:28.260 --> 49:29.860
taught the three of us with our dad.

49:29.860 --> 49:33.460
We do a Dungeons and Dragons podcast that I DM and we've

49:33.460 --> 49:36.020
talked about like when my campaign is over, us taking

49:36.020 --> 49:39.860
turns trying the DM mantel on and Justin, you seemed to

49:39.860 --> 49:44.340
prickle at the thought of of of building a fantasy world.

49:44.340 --> 49:46.500
I'm wondering how much truth there is to you there.

49:46.500 --> 49:47.940
It's infinite truth, Griffin.

49:47.940 --> 49:49.140
It's 100 percent true.

49:49.140 --> 49:52.660
I feel like I don't have a creative bone in my body as far

49:52.660 --> 49:53.700
as that stuff goes.

49:53.700 --> 49:58.260
I just don't have you know, not every the world needs

49:58.260 --> 49:59.300
farmers to Griffin.

49:59.300 --> 50:03.300
Not everybody can create a fantasy world.

50:03.300 --> 50:08.740
Yeah, Justin's too busy working the land to get in there

50:08.740 --> 50:10.420
and make up a D&D campaign.

50:11.700 --> 50:13.140
Watch me bridge this, guys.

50:13.140 --> 50:15.780
This is the best segue I've ever performed in my life.

50:17.060 --> 50:18.900
I really want to back that up.

50:18.900 --> 50:23.300
My two boys because I got one who's six, one who's two, and

50:23.940 --> 50:27.140
I tell little stories with with the older boy.

50:27.860 --> 50:30.900
And a lot of them are, you know, you could call them

50:30.900 --> 50:32.100
collaborative storytelling.

50:32.100 --> 50:34.340
But what I'm really doing is I'm role playing without the

50:34.340 --> 50:38.580
dice, you know, and I put him in a situation and I say, you

50:38.580 --> 50:42.660
find a cave and you go into the cave and what do you do?

50:42.660 --> 50:45.380
And then he gives answers and I tell the story.

50:46.900 --> 50:50.660
And I always kind of was hoping that he would take off more

50:50.660 --> 50:53.620
and more and tell the stories himself.

50:54.180 --> 50:55.220
But he doesn't like that.

50:55.220 --> 50:57.460
He likes being the character in the world.

50:57.460 --> 51:01.380
Now, my littler boy, who's only two and a half, you give him

51:01.380 --> 51:07.220
the slightest starting point and he will, like, launch into

51:07.220 --> 51:08.020
telling a story.

51:08.740 --> 51:10.740
My daughter is almost two.

51:11.380 --> 51:14.180
Currently, she's only interested in ingesting Pee-Wee's

51:14.180 --> 51:14.740
Playhouse.

51:15.300 --> 51:19.620
So the the pretending in our house currently is one hundred

51:19.620 --> 51:22.260
percent Pee-Wee's Playhouse themed.

51:22.820 --> 51:26.500
I portray Terry and Captain Carl when I can find the hat.

51:26.500 --> 51:32.660
My wife is Cowboy Curtis and my daughter is Pee-Wee sometimes

51:32.660 --> 51:36.260
and also Missy Vaughn when I feel like going to find the

51:36.260 --> 51:38.340
dress that she has to wear to be Missy Vaughn.

51:38.340 --> 51:39.380
So, yeah, it's great.

51:39.380 --> 51:43.220
It's actually like makes my life super weird because sometimes

51:43.220 --> 51:46.660
I walk in my room to talk to my wife and my wife's not there.

51:46.660 --> 51:51.140
Cowboy Curtis is, so I've got to talk through Cowboy Curtis.

51:51.140 --> 51:53.780
It sounds like you already started a really cool DM session,

51:53.780 --> 51:54.340
Justin.

51:54.340 --> 51:54.820
Yeah.

51:54.820 --> 51:56.740
We have a question here from Andy.

51:56.740 --> 52:00.340
Do we have a responsibility as parents to sometimes deliberately

52:00.340 --> 52:04.020
frighten our children with scary stories, movies, video games,

52:04.020 --> 52:04.820
et cetera?

52:04.820 --> 52:06.180
That's a great question.

52:06.180 --> 52:10.020
And I'm so torn to give, like, some really bad advice here.

52:10.020 --> 52:11.940
I don't think there's good advice to be had.

52:11.940 --> 52:12.660
Yeah, man.

52:12.660 --> 52:13.860
I'm not going to lie to you.

52:13.860 --> 52:19.220
There's a huge amount of delight to be gained by terrifying

52:19.220 --> 52:20.020
your child.

52:20.020 --> 52:23.140
You know, like, especially if you're in a bit of a mood or

52:23.140 --> 52:26.180
they're being, like, a little bit of a dick, that will happen.

52:26.180 --> 52:27.380
I mean, we love our kids, right?

52:27.380 --> 52:28.660
But they can still be dicks.

52:28.660 --> 52:31.060
Well, I love my brothers and they're dicks all the time.

52:31.060 --> 52:32.180
And he spooks us.

52:32.180 --> 52:34.340
He sends me pictures of ghosts, like, every day.

52:37.140 --> 52:42.660
And so here's a great example of maybe I can show you the good

52:42.660 --> 52:43.940
and the bad.

52:43.940 --> 52:46.260
You know, we're all in bed.

52:46.260 --> 52:50.100
Sarah still sleeps with the boys.

52:50.100 --> 52:53.780
I don't, because I'm huge and the bed isn't big enough.

52:53.780 --> 52:56.180
And so we're all in bed.

52:56.180 --> 52:57.780
We've been reading some stories.

52:57.780 --> 52:59.380
It's time for sleep.

52:59.380 --> 53:05.220
And Sarah says to the older boy, says to Ute, OK, go pee.

53:05.220 --> 53:06.740
It's time for bed.

53:06.740 --> 53:08.100
And it's nighttime.

53:08.100 --> 53:12.820
And it's really easy to forget, as an adult, how terrifying

53:12.820 --> 53:16.820
the dark is, you know?

53:16.820 --> 53:17.700
And he's like, come with me, come with me.

53:17.700 --> 53:20.820
And I'm like, you know, it's down the hallway.

53:20.820 --> 53:22.900
You can turn the lights on.

53:22.900 --> 53:23.620
You can do it.

53:23.620 --> 53:28.180
And it's important for him to get over this a little bit.

53:28.180 --> 53:31.140
Sarah has worked out a compromise where she'll let

53:31.140 --> 53:34.180
him go, but she'll tell him a story so he can hear her

53:34.180 --> 53:36.580
voice, and that's reassuring.

53:36.580 --> 53:38.900
And it gives him enough so that he can go and turn on the

53:38.900 --> 53:40.580
lights and be brave.

53:40.580 --> 53:43.140
And to practice being brave.

53:43.140 --> 53:44.820
And so he goes, will you tell me a story?

53:44.820 --> 53:47.940
And I go, sure.

53:47.940 --> 53:49.220
And so he starts to go.

53:49.220 --> 53:51.060
And I hear his little feet going off.

53:51.060 --> 53:54.820
And I go, once upon a time, there was a little boy, and he

53:54.820 --> 54:01.060
lived in a house with a thousand ghosts made of bone.

54:01.060 --> 54:03.140
And I hear him go, ah.

54:03.140 --> 54:05.220
And then, doop, doop, doop, doop, doop, doop, doop, doop,

54:05.220 --> 54:07.940
like his feet as he's running back into the room.

54:07.940 --> 54:10.580
And he jumps onto the bed.

54:10.580 --> 54:11.460
And I laugh.

54:11.460 --> 54:12.660
And he's like, dad.

54:12.660 --> 54:14.020
And it's OK.

54:14.020 --> 54:15.300
This was a play.

54:15.300 --> 54:17.300
It's a play we're doing.

54:17.300 --> 54:20.020
And so then I go, OK, I'm sorry.

54:20.020 --> 54:21.940
So he gets up, and he starts going again.

54:21.940 --> 54:25.540
And he goes, no bones in this story.

54:25.540 --> 54:27.700
And I go, OK, I'll tell you a story with no bones.

54:27.700 --> 54:30.900
And he goes, OK, once upon a time, there was a boy, and

54:30.900 --> 54:34.580
there was a ghost that ate pee, and it was under the

54:34.580 --> 54:37.940
floor, and it lived near the toilet.

54:37.940 --> 54:40.100
And he comes running back, you know?

54:40.100 --> 54:41.780
And it turns into this big joke.

54:41.780 --> 54:44.580
He keeps going, and I keep telling him a story about a

54:44.580 --> 54:46.900
pee ghost that lives in the floor, and it would come up

54:46.900 --> 54:49.460
when he pees in the toilet, and it's going to get his pee.

54:49.460 --> 54:52.260
Just want to say real quick that ghost that eat pee, you

54:52.260 --> 54:55.300
are completely on brand right now, Patrick Rothfuss, for

54:55.300 --> 54:59.540
the MBMBAM sort of milieu.

54:59.540 --> 55:03.140
And then finally, I've talked about this for a long time.

55:03.140 --> 55:06.340
So and then finally, I've told too many of these stories.

55:06.340 --> 55:08.820
I legitimately freaked him out.

55:08.820 --> 55:11.780
And then he says, and then he's like, he's just not going

55:11.780 --> 55:12.940
to do it anymore.

55:12.940 --> 55:16.340
And Sarah's like, OK, you fucked this up.

55:16.340 --> 55:16.980
Go.

55:16.980 --> 55:18.940
You have to walk him to the bathroom now.

55:18.940 --> 55:20.380
I'm not getting out of bed, because you've

55:20.380 --> 55:21.820
made a mess of this.

55:21.820 --> 55:25.060
So I go, and we go into the bathroom, and he pees.

55:25.060 --> 55:25.980
This has been fun.

55:25.980 --> 55:27.140
This has been a ton of fun.

55:27.140 --> 55:28.580
It's playful.

55:28.580 --> 55:33.260
And I'm in the bathroom, standing behind him, and it

55:33.260 --> 55:37.980
occurs to me how hysterical it would be to just do a little

55:37.980 --> 55:42.460
like, ah, and maybe grab him a little bit, and maybe tickle

55:42.460 --> 55:43.940
him a little bit.

55:43.940 --> 55:49.660
I have the foresight to not do this while he is peeing,

55:49.660 --> 55:52.180
because I don't want to clean that up.

55:52.180 --> 55:57.100
He finishes peeing, and then I just, again, very gently,

55:57.100 --> 56:00.220
because I know my boy, and he can get spooked pretty easy.

56:00.220 --> 56:01.700
He's very gentle.

56:01.700 --> 56:03.500
And so I do just a little one.

56:03.500 --> 56:08.060
I get down, and I get my fingers on his rib, and I go,

56:08.060 --> 56:11.940
wah, but instead of him just having a little jump and a

56:11.940 --> 56:17.940
squeak, he screams bloody murder and completely curls up

56:17.940 --> 56:19.660
into a ball.

56:19.660 --> 56:23.860
And I'm like, oh, I failed.

56:23.860 --> 56:25.900
I've really failed as a dad.

56:25.900 --> 56:28.500
And Sarah's like, what the actual hell is

56:28.500 --> 56:30.300
going on in there?

56:30.300 --> 56:33.020
And so I pick him up, and I sit down on the floor with him,

56:33.020 --> 56:36.300
and I'm like, oh, my sweetie, I am so sorry.

56:36.300 --> 56:37.460
I'm so sorry.

56:37.460 --> 56:41.220
I thought that would be funny, and it wasn't funny.

56:41.220 --> 56:46.020
And he's like, that was dad.

56:46.020 --> 56:46.860
That was super scary.

56:46.860 --> 56:47.940
And I'm like, I'm so sorry.

56:47.940 --> 56:48.700
That was not fair.

56:48.700 --> 56:50.820
I shouldn't have done that.

56:50.820 --> 56:54.940
And he hugs me, and we go back in.

56:54.940 --> 56:58.540
And at this point, I'm like, he's going to remember this.

56:58.540 --> 57:00.900
And when I'm in the hospital as an old man, this is the

57:00.900 --> 57:03.700
memory he's going to flash back to.

57:03.700 --> 57:07.980
He's going to put me in a home because I've

57:07.980 --> 57:09.540
betrayed his trust here.

57:09.540 --> 57:13.220
But we get back, and I'm thinking, I'm the worst dad

57:13.220 --> 57:18.100
ever, and the next day, I'm still dwelling on it.

57:18.100 --> 57:25.100
And I go, you know, I am super sorry that I did that.

57:25.100 --> 57:26.900
I want you to know I won't do that.

57:26.900 --> 57:28.660
And he goes, I thought it would be funny.

57:28.660 --> 57:32.380
He goes, you know, dad, it was a little bit funny.

57:32.380 --> 57:33.540
Oh, that's a cool kid, man.

57:33.540 --> 57:34.500
I would not have let you.

57:34.500 --> 57:37.420
I would have seen how many Nintendo 64 cartridges I could

57:37.420 --> 57:40.620
have shucked out of that situation.

57:40.620 --> 57:41.500
Yeah.

57:41.500 --> 57:44.500
I think it's super important to be just honest with them.

57:44.500 --> 57:49.020
And you don't want to use them as a confessional, but I

57:49.020 --> 57:53.140
think it's really helpful when you screw up, if you say,

57:53.140 --> 57:56.140
boy, I just made a big mistake, and I'm so sorry.

57:56.140 --> 57:59.100
Modeling that behavior for them is really helpful, I

57:59.100 --> 58:00.020
think.

58:00.020 --> 58:02.340
The tricky thing, I feel like, is you don't know which of

58:02.340 --> 58:05.380
those little spooky goofs is going to get deep in their

58:05.380 --> 58:08.460
brain and then be a thing that's scary.

58:08.460 --> 58:12.420
We got Christmas, 1996, McElroy household got a Sony

58:12.420 --> 58:15.500
PlayStation, what's up, best Christmas ever, except the

58:15.500 --> 58:18.980
games that we got were Resident Evil and Blood Omen

58:18.980 --> 58:20.220
Legacy of Kane.

58:20.220 --> 58:23.540
So like nine-year-old Griffin was like, cool, I'm just

58:23.540 --> 58:26.020
going to like, I know I have the first bedtime, so I'm just

58:26.020 --> 58:27.820
going to probably just like chill and sit at the top of

58:27.820 --> 58:30.260
the stairs while I can still see the light coming from the

58:30.260 --> 58:32.740
first floor hallway and just like the comforting voices of

58:32.740 --> 58:35.700
my family before I go to bed and will definitely be like,

58:35.700 --> 58:39.940
you know, eviscerated or eaten.

58:39.940 --> 58:42.060
I still remember, why do all of our fears center around

58:42.060 --> 58:42.900
video games?

58:42.900 --> 58:45.340
I remember the American Final Fantasy III with Palim and

58:45.340 --> 58:49.380
Porom turned to stone to stop walls from crushing you.

58:49.380 --> 58:50.620
Yeah, spoilers, sorry.

58:50.620 --> 58:53.860
And like, that was my fear until I was like 18, that I

58:53.860 --> 58:56.020
would be crushed by walls or turned to stone.

58:56.020 --> 58:58.700
Travis, that was American Final Fantasy II, Final Fantasy

58:58.700 --> 59:00.500
IV, in Japan, sorry.

59:00.500 --> 59:02.220
Sorry, I just wanted to get ahead of the tweets.

59:02.220 --> 59:03.580
Just want to get ahead of the tweets.

59:03.580 --> 59:05.540
Justin, do you want to talk about your phobia or another

59:05.540 --> 59:07.180
question?

59:07.180 --> 59:11.100
No, I've detailed my phobias and excruciating.

59:11.100 --> 59:12.300
Justin's afraid of fiction.

59:12.300 --> 59:16.020
Yeah, I'm afraid of creativity in all its forms.

59:16.020 --> 59:19.660
Burn it from the earth, I say.

59:19.660 --> 59:21.380
I want to do this last question.

59:21.380 --> 59:22.300
Does that sound good to you guys?

59:22.300 --> 59:23.140
Yeah, go for it.

59:23.140 --> 59:23.980
Okay.

59:25.140 --> 59:28.400
How do you balance working on so many projects from home

59:28.400 --> 59:29.980
and raising two kids?

59:29.980 --> 59:32.040
I know two of the brothers Mackroy are expecting and the

59:32.040 --> 59:33.940
other already has a little one, so I failed the discussion.

59:33.940 --> 59:35.700
Everyone could weigh in on.

59:35.700 --> 59:36.540
That's from Mish.

59:36.540 --> 59:41.540
Yeah, I don't know.

59:42.020 --> 59:42.860
Okay, so here's-

59:42.860 --> 59:44.300
Well, that's all the time we have, everybody.

59:44.300 --> 59:46.440
Thanks so much, Patrick, for joining us.

59:46.440 --> 59:47.820
Very good discussion.

59:47.820 --> 59:48.640
How about this?

59:48.640 --> 59:51.580
I knew I would be okay on this podcast because my true

59:51.580 --> 59:56.220
specialty is giving really bad advice that once you hear it,

59:56.220 --> 59:58.660
you're like, oh shit, anything I do will be better than what

59:58.660 --> 59:59.700
Rothfuss suggested.

59:59.700 --> 01:00:00.700
Hey, watch out.

01:00:00.700 --> 01:00:03.020
There's only enough room for one of us in this town.

01:00:03.020 --> 01:00:08.020
And so, you know, I still remember when my older boy,

01:00:10.300 --> 01:00:14.080
when he was, you know, maybe 18 months, which again,

01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:17.660
is this golden time because they're just full of joy

01:00:17.660 --> 01:00:19.900
and wonder and love.

01:00:19.900 --> 01:00:24.460
And I came home from working on book two and I see him

01:00:24.460 --> 01:00:28.660
sitting on the floor, like naked, just like this pink,

01:00:28.660 --> 01:00:33.660
hudgy, like ball of raw joy.

01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:38.780
And he's found a plastic hanger and he's moving it.

01:00:38.780 --> 01:00:41.020
You know, he's like using it and he's hitting the floor

01:00:41.020 --> 01:00:45.140
and he looks up at me and he moves this hanger and he's

01:00:45.140 --> 01:00:49.040
like, he's looking at me thinking, holy man, dad,

01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:52.660
did you know that you could like move a hanger?

01:00:52.660 --> 01:00:55.180
You know, and he's full of joy and excitement over,

01:00:55.180 --> 01:00:57.540
like just banging a hanger around.

01:00:57.540 --> 01:01:01.960
And I'm like, I am missing this, you know?

01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:06.100
And like, for the rest of my life, I will regret putting

01:01:06.100 --> 01:01:10.560
in these 16 hour days to try to get book two done

01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:14.700
because my child was here having this, like,

01:01:14.700 --> 01:01:16.060
and I'm never gonna get this back.

01:01:16.060 --> 01:01:17.820
I'm never gonna get another chance.

01:01:19.780 --> 01:01:23.340
And like, I will, I'll feel bad about it forever.

01:01:23.340 --> 01:01:25.660
Now, that's not to say that I didn't get some good times

01:01:25.660 --> 01:01:28.860
and I didn't spend time, but I tell you, nobody

01:01:28.860 --> 01:01:32.260
on their death bed thinks, boy, I wish I would have spent

01:01:32.260 --> 01:01:33.520
more time at work.

01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:34.500
Sure.

01:01:34.500 --> 01:01:36.680
Although book two's real good.

01:01:37.700 --> 01:01:39.660
It is pretty good, turned out pretty good.

01:01:39.660 --> 01:01:43.300
I guess, I guess, thanks, thank you.

01:01:43.300 --> 01:01:44.140
Thanks.

01:01:44.140 --> 01:01:45.560
You know, everybody always says that about no one

01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:46.400
on their death bed.

01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:49.420
I bet there was one guy who had like just the sickest job

01:01:49.420 --> 01:01:52.620
that he was like, he was just like the captain of parties

01:01:52.620 --> 01:01:53.460
or something and he was like,

01:01:53.460 --> 01:01:55.060
I wish I'd spent more time at work.

01:01:55.060 --> 01:01:55.940
I hated my house.

01:01:55.940 --> 01:01:58.140
The guy who invented like the showbiz pizza company

01:01:58.140 --> 01:02:00.280
is just gonna be like, nice, did it.

01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:03.120
Crushed it.

01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:05.620
Well, but what if there's people on their death bed

01:02:05.620 --> 01:02:08.740
who think, dang, I wish Roth was finished book three.

01:02:08.740 --> 01:02:11.820
I would have loved to tuck into that bad boy.

01:02:11.820 --> 01:02:14.820
Now, that I actually believe, yeah.

01:02:18.260 --> 01:02:20.220
But no, I think the important thing,

01:02:20.220 --> 01:02:22.180
and actually I was talking to Sanderson.

01:02:22.180 --> 01:02:23.580
Sanderson's way better at this,

01:02:23.580 --> 01:02:26.600
not only because he writes 18 times faster than I do,

01:02:28.460 --> 01:02:30.300
but we were talking and he's like, yep.

01:02:30.300 --> 01:02:33.980
He goes, and how's this for gross?

01:02:33.980 --> 01:02:37.380
He says, yep, he goes, I keep it to 10 hours

01:02:37.380 --> 01:02:38.220
of writing a day.

01:02:38.220 --> 01:02:40.920
He goes, 10 hours and I promise myself that I stop

01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:43.460
and I go home and then I spend time with my family.

01:02:43.460 --> 01:02:45.380
Like, you know, 10 hours of writing in a row.

01:02:45.380 --> 01:02:47.380
It's like, ah, you know, I put a lid on it there

01:02:47.380 --> 01:02:48.860
and then after the kids are in bed,

01:02:48.860 --> 01:02:50.580
I can always come back and write more.

01:02:50.580 --> 01:02:51.980
Makes it sound so easy.

01:02:51.980 --> 01:02:55.300
It's weird because it doesn't, there's not a,

01:02:55.300 --> 01:02:58.300
I'll be like completely frank about this

01:02:58.300 --> 01:03:00.200
as long as we're just getting into it.

01:03:01.220 --> 01:03:04.580
The first year that my daughter was alive,

01:03:04.580 --> 01:03:06.720
I was really bad at this.

01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:10.300
I mean, things had really started to pick up with the show

01:03:10.300 --> 01:03:14.820
and I suddenly had a full plate.

01:03:14.820 --> 01:03:17.740
I mean, it was like full, you would think that that's like

01:03:17.740 --> 01:03:20.700
horse apples considering what I do for a living,

01:03:20.700 --> 01:03:23.180
but like the stuff got busy.

01:03:23.180 --> 01:03:28.180
And the thought I would have a lot of the time is,

01:03:28.780 --> 01:03:31.980
well, she's with people who are caring for her,

01:03:31.980 --> 01:03:33.060
so she's fine.

01:03:33.060 --> 01:03:37.460
And the crappy thing about finding balance like that

01:03:37.460 --> 01:03:41.620
is like they will spend time with somebody.

01:03:41.620 --> 01:03:43.760
Like there will be people to fill the gap there

01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:46.580
if you're not like there putting in the hours

01:03:46.580 --> 01:03:50.580
and actually like investing the time into it.

01:03:50.580 --> 01:03:55.220
And like they, I think one of the last realizations you have

01:03:56.260 --> 01:04:00.180
in the process of maturing into a full-blown adult

01:04:00.180 --> 01:04:04.060
is that the time that you do have is precious.

01:04:04.060 --> 01:04:06.380
And like that was, it actually took me I think a year

01:04:06.380 --> 01:04:11.380
after Charlie was born to really like absorb that lesson

01:04:11.740 --> 01:04:16.740
and really make that a part of my day-to-day existence.

01:04:17.060 --> 01:04:19.540
And I still don't think I'm great at it.

01:04:19.540 --> 01:04:21.580
I get to the end of a lot of days

01:04:21.580 --> 01:04:25.820
thinking that I haven't done either particularly well,

01:04:25.820 --> 01:04:30.220
but I guess that's not particularly helpful advice.

01:04:30.220 --> 01:04:33.500
Well, you know, it's, and I'll chime in there as well.

01:04:33.500 --> 01:04:36.620
For me, it's bad enough if you work too long

01:04:37.980 --> 01:04:40.040
and then you don't get in, then you don't get home

01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:42.380
and you only get to spend two hours.

01:04:42.380 --> 01:04:44.280
I remember at one point,

01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:46.460
just to maybe make you feel better about yourself,

01:04:46.460 --> 01:04:48.500
I remember at one point saying,

01:04:48.500 --> 01:04:50.060
like resolving to myself

01:04:50.060 --> 01:04:53.620
that I would spend at least two hours a day with my kid.

01:04:53.620 --> 01:04:55.860
And of course that resolution by itself

01:04:55.860 --> 01:04:59.020
is an extraordinarily like sad thing

01:04:59.020 --> 01:05:01.820
because it implies that I was not spending

01:05:01.820 --> 01:05:04.860
two hours a day with my kid, which is ridiculous.

01:05:04.860 --> 01:05:06.880
You know, it'd be one thing if we were starving to death

01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:08.620
and I was a coal miner,

01:05:08.620 --> 01:05:11.860
but you know, different things shake you in different ways

01:05:11.860 --> 01:05:14.420
and it's kind of a shame a lot of ways

01:05:14.420 --> 01:05:16.780
you don't learn how to do something right

01:05:16.780 --> 01:05:19.820
until you screw it up or until you see

01:05:19.820 --> 01:05:21.060
somebody else screw it up.

01:05:21.060 --> 01:05:23.820
And that's, I feel the service I provide

01:05:23.820 --> 01:05:26.660
to the entire world is screwing things up very visibly

01:05:28.100 --> 01:05:30.740
so other people can learn from my mistakes.

01:05:30.740 --> 01:05:32.460
And you're a real hero.

01:05:32.460 --> 01:05:34.540
I've always said that about you.

01:05:34.540 --> 01:05:36.900
I, you know, I was going to,

01:05:36.900 --> 01:05:39.660
it was one of my first San Diego Comic Cons

01:05:39.660 --> 01:05:42.260
and I went and it's a long con

01:05:42.260 --> 01:05:44.540
and there's a day of travel on either side

01:05:44.540 --> 01:05:46.020
and I'd spent other trips away,

01:05:46.020 --> 01:05:47.140
but they were much shorter.

01:05:47.140 --> 01:05:49.440
I get on the phone and I hear him

01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:52.540
in his tiny piping voice and he's just started to talk

01:05:52.540 --> 01:05:54.380
and he goes, daddy.

01:05:54.380 --> 01:05:56.980
I go, hey, sweet baby, how are you?

01:05:56.980 --> 01:06:01.500
And he goes, daddy, daddy, hold you in my arms.

01:06:01.500 --> 01:06:05.060
Oh, out, out, damn it.

01:06:05.060 --> 01:06:06.780
Now see, the only, I would do,

01:06:06.780 --> 01:06:08.540
I would pull a move like that if I was a child,

01:06:08.540 --> 01:06:10.660
but again, only to get some like

01:06:10.660 --> 01:06:15.340
guilt Nintendo 64 games out of it upon my father's return.

01:06:15.340 --> 01:06:18.060
When he said, hold you in my arms,

01:06:18.060 --> 01:06:20.700
I knew he was expressing that to me,

01:06:20.700 --> 01:06:22.380
but it wasn't his own phrase.

01:06:22.380 --> 01:06:26.600
I knew that phrase came from Corduroy,

01:06:26.600 --> 01:06:28.980
the book, the kid's book,

01:06:28.980 --> 01:06:32.060
because, you know, the Corduroy is looking for an owner.

01:06:32.060 --> 01:06:33.500
He's trying to find his button

01:06:33.500 --> 01:06:35.620
and the little girl picks him up

01:06:35.620 --> 01:06:39.940
and, you know, and holds Corduroy in her arms.

01:06:39.940 --> 01:06:42.940
And so he was thinking of that book

01:06:42.940 --> 01:06:46.140
and somebody bigger holding him

01:06:46.140 --> 01:06:48.460
and taking him to a place.

01:06:48.460 --> 01:06:52.780
And it wasn't that I felt he was ripping something else off,

01:06:52.780 --> 01:06:54.740
it's that I knew the context

01:06:54.740 --> 01:06:56.700
for this little phrase he was using.

01:06:56.700 --> 01:06:59.300
So yeah, I guess that's kind of the overarching thing

01:06:59.300 --> 01:07:01.580
is just kind of get in there and do it

01:07:01.580 --> 01:07:04.900
and know that you'll goof it up and it's okay

01:07:04.900 --> 01:07:07.820
and you'll get better at it, be smart.

01:07:09.100 --> 01:07:10.620
And it's like a muscle, you know,

01:07:10.620 --> 01:07:13.180
you will not be the most patient in the world,

01:07:13.180 --> 01:07:15.580
parent in the world at first,

01:07:15.580 --> 01:07:17.600
but if you don't practice being patient,

01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:19.140
you're not gonna get better at it.

01:07:19.140 --> 01:07:20.620
See, this is why I gotta have a second one

01:07:20.620 --> 01:07:21.940
because I would love to get it right.

01:07:21.940 --> 01:07:23.820
I mean, just like really to get it, just like-

01:07:23.820 --> 01:07:25.220
You really think you could stick the second,

01:07:25.220 --> 01:07:26.060
I could stick the landing.

01:07:26.060 --> 01:07:27.980
I feel like I could really crush it with a sec.

01:07:27.980 --> 01:07:29.780
The first one's like, okay.

01:07:29.780 --> 01:07:31.940
Well, I mean, look at what our parents did.

01:07:31.940 --> 01:07:32.780
Yeah, well-

01:07:32.780 --> 01:07:35.580
Yeah, took them three.

01:07:35.580 --> 01:07:37.260
Took them three to really nail it.

01:07:37.260 --> 01:07:38.780
But as long as we can all agree

01:07:38.780 --> 01:07:40.920
that the second is better than the first.

01:07:40.920 --> 01:07:41.760
I think we can all-

01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:42.600
Well, in a lot of ways,

01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:44.820
you can over-correct on the second one.

01:07:44.820 --> 01:07:45.820
Sure, right.

01:07:45.820 --> 01:07:48.520
Patrick, thank you so much for joining us.

01:07:48.520 --> 01:07:49.620
Thank you so much.

01:07:49.620 --> 01:07:51.580
I will say I've had a ton of fun.

01:07:51.580 --> 01:07:53.980
I can talk about being a parent for days,

01:07:53.980 --> 01:07:58.380
but you know, if, I feel like I've kind of betrayed

01:07:58.380 --> 01:08:01.740
some of the underlying, you know,

01:08:01.740 --> 01:08:03.620
the brand of the podcast here,

01:08:03.620 --> 01:08:05.460
I would love to come back at some point

01:08:05.460 --> 01:08:08.260
and talk about like some stuff that I'm really bad at

01:08:08.260 --> 01:08:09.460
and give bad advice.

01:08:09.460 --> 01:08:10.300
Great.

01:08:10.300 --> 01:08:11.120
Oh, sure.

01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:13.040
What would those areas of unexpertise look like?

01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:13.880
What are we-

01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:14.700
Dating.

01:08:14.700 --> 01:08:15.540
Oh, okay.

01:08:15.540 --> 01:08:16.360
Mm-hmm.

01:08:16.360 --> 01:08:21.360
And maybe I could give some really bad dating advice.

01:08:22.180 --> 01:08:25.120
Pretty much anything socially interacting

01:08:25.120 --> 01:08:26.060
with other human beings.

01:08:26.060 --> 01:08:28.300
Oh, shit, dude, you're gonna be a total fit in

01:08:28.300 --> 01:08:29.140
on this podcast.

01:08:29.140 --> 01:08:29.960
Yeah, you're gonna be great.

01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:30.800
It's gonna be perfect.

01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:31.620
It's gonna be perfect.

01:08:31.620 --> 01:08:35.420
Patrick, obviously, sometimes when we ask guests on the show,

01:08:35.420 --> 01:08:36.920
where can people find your work?

01:08:36.920 --> 01:08:41.420
Like, for you, the answer is like bookstores and Amazon.

01:08:41.420 --> 01:08:44.200
You also have a podcast, I don't think we've talked about it,

01:08:44.200 --> 01:08:48.220
called Unattended Consequences that you do with Max Timken

01:08:48.220 --> 01:08:50.540
from Cards Against Humanity.

01:08:50.540 --> 01:08:55.300
Anything else that people can find that you do on internet?

01:08:56.500 --> 01:09:00.860
One big thing that I do is it's sort of,

01:09:00.860 --> 01:09:02.680
you know, on again, off again.

01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:04.740
I run a charity called World Builders.

01:09:04.740 --> 01:09:09.060
We raise money for various charitable causes,

01:09:09.060 --> 01:09:11.020
primarily Heifer International,

01:09:12.580 --> 01:09:15.880
but also a charity called First Book,

01:09:15.880 --> 01:09:18.460
which gets books into the hands of little kids

01:09:18.460 --> 01:09:20.780
who have maybe never owned a book in their life.

01:09:21.780 --> 01:09:24.820
Or we did some stuff for the Syrian refugees.

01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:29.400
World Builders, you know, we do a bunch of different stuff.

01:09:29.400 --> 01:09:31.780
You can find them on worldbuilders.org.

01:09:31.780 --> 01:09:34.500
We've raised, I think, maybe $5 million

01:09:34.500 --> 01:09:37.720
for various charities over the last couple of years.

01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:41.340
We rally geeks who wanna make the world a better place,

01:09:41.340 --> 01:09:45.100
and we help make that happen, and we sell cool merch

01:09:45.100 --> 01:09:47.500
and giveaway books and games and stuff, so.

01:09:47.500 --> 01:09:48.340
Cool.

01:09:48.340 --> 01:09:50.820
Great, so yeah, Patrick, thank you for joining us.

01:09:50.820 --> 01:09:51.660
Thank you for doing the show.

01:09:51.660 --> 01:09:55.480
Thank you for maybe once in 311 episodes

01:09:55.480 --> 01:09:58.420
offering some real sincere good advice.

01:09:58.420 --> 01:09:59.420
Much appreciated.

01:10:00.540 --> 01:10:01.380
Thanks so much for having me, guys.

01:10:01.380 --> 01:10:02.380
Thanks for breaking the streak.

01:10:02.380 --> 01:10:04.020
Thanks for putting up with me.

01:10:04.020 --> 01:10:05.220
This has been such a treat.

01:10:05.220 --> 01:10:07.420
Let's wrap up here real quick.

01:10:07.420 --> 01:10:08.460
Some things we need to talk about.

01:10:08.460 --> 01:10:11.300
We are doing live shows in Boston this next weekend.

01:10:11.300 --> 01:10:13.060
Live Adventure Zone and a live Mabim Bam.

01:10:13.060 --> 01:10:15.060
We need questions, both if you're gonna be

01:10:15.060 --> 01:10:18.380
in the audience in Boston and wanna ask advice.

01:10:18.380 --> 01:10:21.260
Send that into, what's our email address even?

01:10:21.260 --> 01:10:23.140
Nobody's quite sure, huh?

01:10:23.140 --> 01:10:25.780
MBMBAM at maximumfun.org.

01:10:25.780 --> 01:10:27.320
Oh, tricky to remember, huh?

01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:28.700
Could also use some Yahoos,

01:10:28.700 --> 01:10:32.000
so any of my Yahoo soldiers to come out in full force.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.400
Again, we're doing a Monikers expansion.

01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:36.620
Go to mackeroicollection.com.

01:10:36.620 --> 01:10:38.020
We're doing a pre-order for 30 days.

01:10:38.020 --> 01:10:40.420
You can get the expansion for 10 bucks

01:10:40.420 --> 01:10:42.280
or a collection with the expansion

01:10:42.280 --> 01:10:44.180
and the base game for 35.

01:10:44.180 --> 01:10:45.900
Again, mackeroicollection.com.

01:10:45.900 --> 01:10:48.460
I wanna say, if you're looking for other shows to check out,

01:10:48.460 --> 01:10:51.020
check out all the other amazing shows on maximumfun.org.

01:10:51.020 --> 01:10:53.300
There's a ton on there that you're gonna like.

01:10:53.300 --> 01:10:57.200
We also do a couple shows that are a little more independent.

01:10:57.200 --> 01:10:59.060
One of my favorite podcasts in the world

01:10:59.060 --> 01:11:01.320
that I look forward to and listen to every week,

01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:03.020
even if I don't have time for anything else,

01:11:03.020 --> 01:11:05.260
I make time for it, is Rose Buddies

01:11:05.260 --> 01:11:06.260
with Griffin and Rachel,

01:11:06.260 --> 01:11:08.900
where they watch and recap The Bachelor and The Bachelorette.

01:11:08.900 --> 01:11:12.060
It is, no joke, one of my favorite things

01:11:12.060 --> 01:11:13.180
that exist in the world right now,

01:11:13.180 --> 01:11:15.060
so I encourage everyone to check it out.

01:11:15.060 --> 01:11:18.800
I also do a show with my friend Tybee called Interrobang,

01:11:18.800 --> 01:11:20.300
where we talk about the things in the world

01:11:20.300 --> 01:11:22.260
that are frustrating us and frustrating you.

01:11:22.260 --> 01:11:27.020
Every fifth episode is an audience submitted topics episode,

01:11:27.020 --> 01:11:28.420
and we just did one,

01:11:28.420 --> 01:11:30.000
and you know, there's a lot of frustrating stuff

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:31.100
going on in the world right now,

01:11:31.100 --> 01:11:33.140
and I'm just trying to build kind of a safe place

01:11:33.140 --> 01:11:35.080
for discussion in podcast form,

01:11:35.080 --> 01:11:36.660
so check that out, called Interrobang.

01:11:36.660 --> 01:11:38.940
And also, you guys have put out a new episode

01:11:38.940 --> 01:11:43.220
of The Monster Factory recently that I thoroughly enjoyed,

01:11:43.220 --> 01:11:44.820
and I want everyone to go check that out too.

01:11:44.820 --> 01:11:49.060
Griffin and Justin do probably the funniest thing

01:11:49.060 --> 01:11:51.500
on the internet called Monster Factory on YouTube

01:11:51.500 --> 01:11:53.260
through their website Polygon,

01:11:53.260 --> 01:11:56.300
where they create just the most abhorrent characters

01:11:56.300 --> 01:11:59.420
through character creation engines in video games,

01:11:59.420 --> 01:12:01.460
and it's pretty much everyone's favorite thing

01:12:01.460 --> 01:12:04.140
on the internet, so go check that out.

01:12:04.140 --> 01:12:05.100
Thank you, Travis.

01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:07.700
Thanks again to Patrick Rothfuss

01:12:07.700 --> 01:12:09.860
for being our guest for this week,

01:12:09.860 --> 01:12:11.820
and thanks to John Roderick and the Long Winters

01:12:11.820 --> 01:12:13.020
for these four theme songs that set apart

01:12:13.020 --> 01:12:14.620
drop the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

01:12:14.620 --> 01:12:15.460
It's a wonderful album,

01:12:15.460 --> 01:12:17.620
and you can find it wherever albums are sold.

01:12:19.460 --> 01:12:20.300
Is that it?

01:12:20.300 --> 01:12:23.660
Oh, oh, oh, we're gonna be at Max Fun Con East.

01:12:23.660 --> 01:12:26.100
If you haven't picked up your tickets yet, go get those.

01:12:26.100 --> 01:12:28.140
We wanna see you there, we wanna hang out with you

01:12:28.140 --> 01:12:31.500
in the scary, shining hotel in the Poconos Mountains.

01:12:31.500 --> 01:12:33.380
You get to hang out with all the Magroys

01:12:33.380 --> 01:12:35.220
and I think the Smurls as well.

01:12:35.220 --> 01:12:39.300
It's gonna be a crazy fun time hanging out in the mountains.

01:12:39.300 --> 01:12:41.460
Come see us, hang out, it's gonna be great.

01:12:41.460 --> 01:12:42.980
We really want you there.

01:12:42.980 --> 01:12:47.020
I think you can go to maxfuncon.com for all the information.

01:12:47.020 --> 01:12:49.380
Well, we should make it clear, we're doing not in Bim Bam,

01:12:49.380 --> 01:12:51.180
we're doing Adventure Zone there, so.

01:12:51.180 --> 01:12:52.380
Yep, come hang out.

01:12:52.380 --> 01:12:54.900
Last Yahoo Time, this one was sent in by Zoe Kinski,

01:12:54.900 --> 01:12:56.580
riding high, Zoe Kinski, thank you Zoe,

01:12:56.580 --> 01:13:01.380
by Yahoo Answers user, RG778SX, who asks,

01:13:02.660 --> 01:13:04.820
how many people agree that Smash Mouth

01:13:04.820 --> 01:13:07.420
at the end of Rat Race was a crummy way

01:13:07.420 --> 01:13:09.460
to end a classic comedy?

01:13:09.460 --> 01:13:14.460
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

01:13:17.540 --> 01:13:19.340
