00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:46.880
Hello everybody and welcome to My Brother, My Brother and Me,

00:46.880 --> 00:50.480
an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

00:50.480 --> 00:53.360
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

00:53.360 --> 01:07.840
And I'm sweet, sensual Valentine's Day brother. Not brother, but sensual gentleman,

01:07.840 --> 01:10.480
Griffin McElroy, the youngest brother, your brother.

01:12.240 --> 01:15.600
Wait, are you their sensual brother?

01:15.600 --> 01:23.120
I've got two Ferrero Rochers and I've put them in a suggestive sensual position.

01:25.680 --> 01:26.640
My nipples.

01:27.840 --> 01:32.720
I figured, listen guys, pause the show. I think that maybe there might be people out there who

01:32.720 --> 01:36.480
don't, and we all know that we love Valentine's Day. It's the most important holiday.

01:36.480 --> 01:37.840
It's the most sacred holiday.

01:37.840 --> 01:39.520
The most natural holiday.

01:39.520 --> 01:42.960
Most natural holiday Jesus invented a long time ago. And so there might be people who

01:42.960 --> 01:49.680
don't have a sensual lover and so they might want some help, like podcast help with that.

01:49.680 --> 01:52.720
And we help with every other thing, I don't see why. And it can be completely platonic,

01:52.720 --> 01:54.720
you know what I mean? Like a platonic sensual.

01:54.720 --> 01:58.960
I do like this though, Griffin, because in the past we've helped people find love.

01:58.960 --> 02:03.360
And what if we just cut out the middleman, which is us, and we just were like, hey,

02:03.360 --> 02:04.480
we're here for love.

02:04.480 --> 02:10.720
Well, I love my wife very, very much. There will be no dalliances today, thank you.

02:10.720 --> 02:11.120
Yes.

02:11.120 --> 02:15.600
But we can, but it's like a make pretend.

02:15.600 --> 02:21.120
And listen, here's what I'll do, and gosh darn it, we done missed it. This is, I don't

02:21.120 --> 02:25.200
know, January or February or whatever day it is when you listen to this, it's not Valentine's

02:25.200 --> 02:28.880
Day. But if you want to tell people that I was your Valentine, you can.

02:28.880 --> 02:30.640
No, no, no, that's too far. That's too far. That's too far.

02:30.640 --> 02:31.360
That's too far?

02:31.360 --> 02:34.160
Yes, this episode is, you could say the episode is.

02:34.800 --> 02:39.760
Oh, the episode is your, okay, yeah, you're right. Hey, don't lie, this episode is your

02:39.760 --> 02:40.400
Valentine.

02:40.400 --> 02:42.960
Okay, Justin, you want to get a hand on this ball or you're going to sit this one out,

02:42.960 --> 02:43.280
you think?

02:43.280 --> 02:49.040
I don't know where the ball is, guys. It's confusing enough that Travis is committing

02:49.040 --> 02:50.400
adultery and Griffin is-

02:50.400 --> 02:54.080
No, no, no, no, I'm letting people lie about me committing adultery.

02:54.080 --> 03:01.120
No, no, we don't even do that. The podcast episode is your sensual friend for today,

03:01.120 --> 03:04.240
the most sacred of all the high holy days.

03:04.240 --> 03:08.640
Griffin, here's my question, because the word could mean many different things, but is the

03:08.640 --> 03:12.480
okay, when you say the episode is your Valentine, do you mean like we're walking around the

03:12.480 --> 03:16.000
classroom and we're putting this on the envelope you've taped to the front of your desk, or

03:16.560 --> 03:21.920
this is the podcast is putting a note in the envelope taped to the front of your desk?

03:21.920 --> 03:24.080
You love the podcast.

03:24.080 --> 03:24.480
Yes.

03:25.520 --> 03:28.320
That's the end of the sentence. That's the end of the thought.

03:28.320 --> 03:30.480
You love the podcast, now the podcast loves you.

03:30.480 --> 03:32.080
You now love the podcast.

03:32.080 --> 03:36.080
Finally, it's reciprocated. It's the podcast loves you.

03:36.080 --> 03:42.800
Okay, are you right? I'm paused. I have these two Ferrero Rochers where my nipples are.

03:42.800 --> 03:44.080
The podcast nipples.

03:44.080 --> 03:49.360
Yeah, and then I'm sitting on a bed of poetry. The episode sitting on a bed of poetry I wrote

03:49.360 --> 03:50.000
for you.

03:50.000 --> 03:50.000
Thank you.

03:50.000 --> 03:54.320
Yeah, and it's getting the chocolate everywhere, streaks it, streaks it.

03:54.320 --> 04:00.080
No, wait, you said pretty plainly that the chocolate was on your Griffin McElroy's nipples.

04:00.080 --> 04:04.080
I did a tumble. I did a tumble. I did a tumble into the paper.

04:04.080 --> 04:06.400
That does sound like something I would see on Tumblr. That's fair.

04:06.400 --> 04:07.920
Son of a, come on!

04:07.920 --> 04:14.480
No, but Griffin, you're saying, are you personifying your own body for chocolate delivery?

04:14.480 --> 04:19.440
I was wearing a suit with little Velcro Ferrero Rochers all over it.

04:19.440 --> 04:21.520
Like a mocap?

04:21.520 --> 04:25.200
And you have to, yeah, like mocap balls. And then for Valentine's Day as a special treat,

04:25.200 --> 04:28.480
you get to run around, try and grab them off me. But I did a tumble into the poetry that

04:28.480 --> 04:29.280
the podcast made for you.

04:29.280 --> 04:34.800
No, but you're still saying you, Griffin. I thought the podcast was the Valentine.

04:34.800 --> 04:35.040
Yeah.

04:35.760 --> 04:37.920
But you're saying you are covered in chocolate.

04:39.680 --> 04:44.480
The podcast is the one seducing you on the bed of poetry. I'm also there wearing a suit

04:44.480 --> 04:47.040
of Ferrero Rochers in case you get peckish.

04:47.840 --> 04:49.200
So you're just the caterer?

04:49.200 --> 04:51.600
Completely platonic body food.

04:53.040 --> 04:55.840
I'm wearing clothes under the Ferrero Rochers.

04:55.840 --> 04:56.320
Okay.

04:57.040 --> 04:57.840
Okay.

04:57.840 --> 05:01.680
For me, it's a fun game where I see if I can, because after five minutes,

05:01.680 --> 05:05.360
I get to keep all the Ferrero Rochers that you didn't grab off him.

05:05.360 --> 05:08.320
Oh, it's kind of like a big game that captures the flag.

05:08.320 --> 05:12.560
It's like, capture the flag, but it's all me hazelnut chocolates.

05:12.560 --> 05:15.920
Hey, welcome to Wild and Crazy Kids. This week, you got a special game. You're going

05:15.920 --> 05:19.920
to grab those chocolate off those people, and if they don't, they eat them.

05:19.920 --> 05:24.800
I just, I don't see what the fucking confusion is. We do this every fucking year.

05:26.160 --> 05:26.880
Start the metaphor.

05:26.880 --> 05:28.080
Are you eating a Ferrero Rocher?

05:28.080 --> 05:28.560
Was that a Ferrero?

05:28.560 --> 05:32.400
Start the metaphor over, and don't involve your corporeal form in it.

05:32.400 --> 05:32.880
Okay.

05:32.880 --> 05:33.840
See if you can do this.

05:33.840 --> 05:34.640
Start again. Hello.

05:34.640 --> 05:39.120
Hi, everybody. Welcome, my brother, my brother, me, et cetera. And then Griffin says...

05:39.120 --> 05:42.320
This is podcast. I love you. Grab this candy.

05:42.960 --> 05:46.480
Where's the candy? Wait, wait. Where's the candy?

05:47.280 --> 05:55.360
The podcast that is this one has candy all over its suit, wearing it like a mocap.

05:55.360 --> 06:00.080
Are you eating? Who is eating what right now? Who's eating Gilbert grapes right now?

06:00.080 --> 06:03.200
I'm eating up this delicious description you're giving up.

06:03.200 --> 06:06.720
Yeah, of a sentient podcast that's down for love.

06:06.720 --> 06:11.360
Well, nobody's going to love this thing now because you guys have... You guys have fucking...

06:11.360 --> 06:13.360
Oh, Griffin, you put chocolate on your own nipples.

06:14.240 --> 06:15.680
Griffin, could you describe the podcast for me?

06:15.680 --> 06:20.000
You didn't let me finish that part. I have it on my nipples, but then it's everywhere else too.

06:20.000 --> 06:24.800
No, no. You finished it. That part was completed.

06:24.800 --> 06:29.280
Here comes the poetry pile. I jump in. I get all my chocolate streaks everywhere.

06:29.280 --> 06:34.480
No, you can't be there. I'm sorry, Griffin. You are not allowed

06:34.480 --> 06:38.000
to see whatever Valentine happens between the episode and the listener.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.640
You recorded the episode. You left the episode.

06:40.640 --> 06:43.600
Okay, okay, okay. Hold on. And here's the next part.

06:43.600 --> 06:45.920
And then I see you approaching the podcast episode.

06:45.920 --> 06:49.600
I take off a few Ferrero's and throw them in your direction just because I've had a big round.

06:49.600 --> 06:54.480
Well, let's stop. Shut up. And then I walk meekly backwards out of the room.

06:54.480 --> 06:57.520
And then whatever you do with podcasts at that point is up to you,

06:57.520 --> 07:01.040
God, and podcast and the Ferrero Rochers. That's better.

07:01.040 --> 07:02.720
That was much better. Here's the two issues that I still have.

07:02.720 --> 07:05.280
I wouldn't say much, Justin. That was very generous.

07:05.280 --> 07:08.480
Somewhat better. Here's the two issues that I still have with this.

07:08.480 --> 07:12.240
One, you're technically stripping because you are removing layers.

07:12.240 --> 07:13.760
I got clothes on underneath the Ferrero Rochers.

07:13.760 --> 07:17.680
I know, but it's a long con kind of strip, but it is stripping.

07:17.680 --> 07:21.840
No, I disagree with you on that point, Justin, because when I see someone take their jacket off,

07:21.840 --> 07:26.400
I'm not like, whoa, whoa, whoa, NSFW. Depends on how they take it off, though.

07:26.400 --> 07:28.080
The way I take off a jacket.

07:28.080 --> 07:32.160
When podcast takes his jacket off, it does it the cool, like backwards Jeb Bartlett.

07:32.160 --> 07:33.280
Yeah, there you go.

07:33.280 --> 07:37.280
The other thing I had was that you fed people chocolate off your body.

07:37.280 --> 07:37.520
No.

07:37.520 --> 07:39.920
And that's another one that's got a little bit charged.

07:39.920 --> 07:41.040
Gave it to them.

07:41.040 --> 07:41.680
Gave it to them.

07:42.320 --> 07:45.520
And if I remember correctly, you more flung it at them.

07:45.520 --> 07:46.720
One of two things happened.

07:47.280 --> 07:51.040
Either you threw your body chocolate on the dirty floor,

07:51.040 --> 07:52.720
or you fed it lovingly to them.

07:52.720 --> 07:54.320
Which of those two options?

07:54.320 --> 07:56.480
You're saying, oh, OK, and you hear that audience?

07:56.480 --> 07:58.320
Justin says you all can't catch good.

07:59.520 --> 08:00.080
Interesting.

08:00.080 --> 08:03.360
Did you throw it like a Benihana chef and they caught it in their mouth?

08:04.160 --> 08:06.640
Or with their fucking hands.

08:06.640 --> 08:07.040
Gross.

08:07.040 --> 08:10.720
Then they're going to get chocolate all over their hands before reading the poetry.

08:10.720 --> 08:15.440
The body impact when I dive into the poetry pile makes the foil come off and streaks the chocolate.

08:15.440 --> 08:18.000
I don't see why are you guys wrestling?

08:18.000 --> 08:19.440
It's been nine fucking minutes.

08:19.440 --> 08:21.760
You're the one wrestling with the poetry.

08:21.760 --> 08:24.240
OK, I just want to suggest, start over.

08:24.240 --> 08:24.960
All right.

08:24.960 --> 08:26.080
God, heaven.

08:26.080 --> 08:31.520
Hey, it's my brother, my brother, and me podcast killing it year in, year out.

08:31.520 --> 08:33.280
This time, Griffin's going to say something.

08:33.280 --> 08:38.160
So Valentine's Day is upon us, and we would like you to make love to the podcast.

08:38.160 --> 08:42.640
And by make love, I mean it in the literal sense and not in the coital sense.

08:43.200 --> 08:48.080
You and the podcast, there was no love before, but now there will be love with you

08:48.080 --> 08:51.040
and this inanimate podcast to help set the scene.

08:52.160 --> 08:53.440
I will appear in the room.

08:54.720 --> 08:55.280
Shush.

08:55.280 --> 08:56.960
The podcast will also be there.

08:56.960 --> 08:57.760
You will be there.

08:57.760 --> 09:00.720
I have a suit of Ferrero Rochers if you get peckish.

09:00.720 --> 09:02.560
And also, I have wine balloons.

09:03.120 --> 09:04.160
Do you want one?

09:04.160 --> 09:04.880
Wait, where are they?

09:06.960 --> 09:09.120
I have 12 wine balloons hidden all around.

09:10.720 --> 09:11.760
Did you say hidden?

09:12.800 --> 09:13.920
Why are they hidden?

09:13.920 --> 09:14.800
Why are they hidden?

09:14.800 --> 09:15.840
Why would you hide them?

09:15.840 --> 09:17.280
You fucking Easter bunny.

09:17.280 --> 09:18.800
It's not a fun surprise.

09:18.800 --> 09:19.920
You know where they are.

09:21.200 --> 09:25.520
I have a suit of Ferrero Rochers over my clothes.

09:25.520 --> 09:27.520
You will not come at me with your mouth open.

09:27.520 --> 09:28.480
I will hand them to you.

09:28.480 --> 09:30.960
You will take them with your hands, unwrap them, and eat them.

09:30.960 --> 09:33.520
Sometimes I will jump in the poetry pile.

09:33.520 --> 09:38.640
Sometimes there's a wine balloon in there too, and I make a terrible, terrible mess.

09:38.640 --> 09:42.160
But then when it's time for you and the podcast to consummate it,

09:42.160 --> 09:43.840
I'm going to back out of the room meekly.

09:43.840 --> 09:45.200
I will no longer be present.

09:45.840 --> 09:46.560
Here's what I have.

09:46.560 --> 09:49.360
Okay, I want to go back to the things that I hate.

09:49.360 --> 09:53.680
So one of the main ones is that you've locked someone in a room with a podcast

09:53.680 --> 09:57.360
that they may not even be in.

09:57.360 --> 09:58.560
He didn't say lock the door.

09:58.560 --> 10:01.920
He just said he was going to leave them to whatever they get up to.

10:01.920 --> 10:06.960
But the implication is clearly that they're going to do it, this person and the podcast.

10:06.960 --> 10:10.000
And can we make clear that it's an episode of a podcast?

10:10.000 --> 10:10.960
It's not the whole podcast.

10:10.960 --> 10:12.000
It's not the whole podcast.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.880
That's semantics, because we've done some things on this podcast,

10:14.880 --> 10:16.720
broadly speaking, that no one would love.

10:16.720 --> 10:18.080
We got unfuckable eps.

10:18.080 --> 10:22.000
I just want to go back also to the wine.

10:22.000 --> 10:26.960
I feel like a wine balloon popping over a pile of poetry.

10:26.960 --> 10:29.040
Is the sexiest thing you've ever heard?

10:29.040 --> 10:31.440
It's one, it's someone's fetish.

10:31.440 --> 10:34.480
Don't forget about the chocolate streaks from my suit.

10:34.480 --> 10:37.200
Yeah, now is it red wine or white?

10:37.200 --> 10:39.680
Of course it's red wine, it's Valentine's Day.

10:39.680 --> 10:42.640
And it's popping on the rose thorns.

10:42.640 --> 10:44.960
I've sprinkled thorns all over the bed.

10:44.960 --> 10:45.760
You're not there.

10:45.760 --> 10:50.000
Jesse Thorne, Teresa Thorne, they're all on the bed, sprinkled lovingly.

10:50.000 --> 10:53.440
I will say, I realized in Griffin's 18th take at this,

10:53.440 --> 10:55.920
that while Justin and I have been upset at it,

10:55.920 --> 11:02.000
this idea of a holiday concierge is basically what Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny are.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.320
They come in, they provide you all the stuff,

11:04.320 --> 11:06.560
and then they leave and let you get down to it.

11:06.560 --> 11:08.880
Yeah, there needs to be one of those for Valentine's Day, Cupid.

11:08.880 --> 11:10.080
What's our first question?

11:10.080 --> 11:10.800
One more try.

11:10.800 --> 11:14.080
There's no way we can do this.

11:14.080 --> 11:14.880
This is my brother.

11:14.880 --> 11:16.640
Griffin is a winged cherub.

11:16.640 --> 11:18.640
This is my brother of a show.

11:20.800 --> 11:21.120
I feel like we need-

11:21.120 --> 11:22.640
This is a brother of an episode.

11:22.640 --> 11:26.960
Yeah, we need indices, indices A before I even start going.

11:26.960 --> 11:30.160
I'm wearing clothes fully, and there's no question about that.

11:30.160 --> 11:32.640
Over the clothes, I have stuck many Ferrero Rochers.

11:32.640 --> 11:35.440
Like, can you edit this to be sequentially first?

11:35.440 --> 11:35.840
Yes.

11:35.840 --> 11:41.280
I want this to be the first thing people hear, okay.

11:41.280 --> 11:43.200
There are 12 wine balloons hidden throughout the room.

11:43.200 --> 11:44.880
If you are hungry, there's the Rochers.

11:44.880 --> 11:46.800
If you are thirsty, there is wine.

11:46.800 --> 11:51.600
The only other object in the room is the podcast episode that this is.

11:51.600 --> 11:52.720
What about the poetry pile?

11:52.720 --> 11:55.520
The poetry pile is also there as the third, fourth-

11:55.520 --> 11:58.800
Could we also include a button on the wall, like in an escape room?

11:58.800 --> 12:02.640
Like, hey, if at any time you want me to unlock the door, just hit this button.

12:02.640 --> 12:05.280
If it gets too wet and wild in there, here's the button that you press.

12:05.280 --> 12:08.720
It's over the poetry pile, and you're going to have to sort of scramble around in there.

12:08.720 --> 12:09.440
It's rough terrain.

12:09.440 --> 12:11.600
To find the flag in the poetry pile.

12:11.600 --> 12:13.840
I'm going to count to 30 and leave.

12:15.280 --> 12:20.880
If you can find all the wine balloons before then, you get $10,000 furnished by San Pellegrino.

12:24.880 --> 12:26.480
And a trip to space camp.

12:26.480 --> 12:28.480
I'm so glad we got a sponsor.

12:28.480 --> 12:29.280
Yeah.

12:29.280 --> 12:31.440
I'm so glad we got a sponsor for this.

12:31.440 --> 12:34.080
I want to welcome San Pellegrino to sponsor the show.

12:34.080 --> 12:39.040
You also get a booth at the Food and Wine Festival, and you don't even have to know what to do with that.

12:39.040 --> 12:42.800
I'm worried that including a sponsor is going to make this holiday too commercial.

12:42.800 --> 12:43.680
Yeah, probably.

12:43.680 --> 12:44.400
I worry.

12:44.400 --> 12:46.720
Let's switch it for BK Nights.

12:46.720 --> 12:47.600
What are they doing?

12:47.600 --> 12:48.800
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:48.800 --> 12:50.880
Maybe a Casio keyboard in there?

12:50.880 --> 12:51.360
Sure.

12:51.360 --> 12:52.160
So.

12:52.160 --> 12:54.160
So, okay.

12:54.160 --> 12:56.640
I think that that's got it.

12:56.640 --> 13:03.040
I think what I love about this, Griffin, here's a quick list, bullet pointed.

13:03.040 --> 13:08.800
One is I think that you have not included yourself physically in it.

13:08.800 --> 13:16.640
You've much more resigned yourself to a Jeff Probst role or Chris Harrison role who is clearly on the periphery.

13:16.640 --> 13:26.160
And I feel like it's kind of like those cats also where it's like clearly on the periphery, but the implication is always that if they decided to compete, they would win.

13:26.160 --> 13:27.440
They would beat ass, yeah.

13:27.440 --> 13:30.640
Yeah, so that's good.

13:30.640 --> 13:38.240
And I think it's also like a very romantic, loving environment that you've created for the podcast episode and the listener.

13:38.240 --> 13:42.800
Yeah, and fun, too, fun, because you got to find the balloons and poetry can be fun for some people.

13:42.800 --> 13:45.760
Yeah, maybe the poet, but nobody else.

13:45.760 --> 13:47.920
Here comes our first question.

13:47.920 --> 13:50.800
My parents sent me a Valentine's Day card today.

13:50.800 --> 13:54.240
Now, I don't keep in touch with them as much as I used to, and I have to-

13:54.240 --> 13:55.200
Shame.

13:55.200 --> 13:56.240
Shame.

13:56.240 --> 14:00.240
They sent it to me as an attempt to cheer me up about my lack of a romantic partner.

14:00.240 --> 14:01.840
Well, we handled that.

14:01.840 --> 14:06.240
You're in a committed relationship with a podcast episode.

14:06.240 --> 14:11.200
As reality has it, I do have a partner, one who I've been dating for almost a year now.

14:11.200 --> 14:16.400
I just forgot to tell my parents about my relationship due to how infrequently we catch up.

14:16.400 --> 14:17.360
Hachi machi.

14:17.360 --> 14:23.440
The card that my parents sent me is not only very fancy, but the endorsement on it isn't written on the card directly,

14:23.440 --> 14:26.400
but is instead on a piece of paper that slides out of the card.

14:26.400 --> 14:29.760
Can I replace it with a new dedication and give this card to my significant other?

14:29.760 --> 14:32.720
That's from Valentine's vexed in San Francisco.

14:32.720 --> 14:33.520
No!

14:33.520 --> 14:36.080
I need a fucking map for that question.

14:36.080 --> 14:40.640
What a buckwild, like, light cycle-esque turn that took.

14:40.640 --> 14:44.880
Just like a hard fucking bank, and I'm exploding into your light wall.

14:44.880 --> 14:45.600
What?

14:45.600 --> 14:52.160
I just want everyone to know, I put together the question list, and I don't always know if a question is going to be a winner,

14:52.160 --> 14:56.400
but when I hear Griffin do that, like, lean away from the microphone, like, oh my god.

14:56.400 --> 14:58.800
Like, I know, I got it.

14:58.800 --> 15:03.360
Yowza, I mean, I really thought, how do I tell my parents I've been in a relationship for years?

15:03.360 --> 15:06.560
Certainly would take precedence over, how do I save $1.26?

15:06.560 --> 15:09.600
How do I grift both my parents and my lover?

15:09.600 --> 15:13.040
Yeah, um, Yowza, I mean, yeah, ugh.

15:13.040 --> 15:21.280
This is some real, I think nothing's funnier than pulling off the gag, and not everybody can do it, and a lot of people try,

15:21.280 --> 15:24.560
of like, re-gifting the card.

15:24.560 --> 15:30.800
I've never seen anybody do it, um, earnestly, with an earnest mind, an earnest heart, to say,

15:30.800 --> 15:33.040
this, oh, this is not the same card.

15:33.040 --> 15:38.480
Most of the time, it's like, uh-oh, yeah, this was totally from my four-year-old nephew, Todrick.

15:38.480 --> 15:42.880
Uh, see, and I marked his name out, and I put mine in, as a funny joke.

15:42.880 --> 15:48.000
This is a new strat altogether that I've never heard of, and I don't think is quite good.

15:48.000 --> 15:52.400
I will say, though, I think now you can never tell your parents about your significant other,

15:52.400 --> 15:56.000
or they're just gonna feel absolutely ripped off, because they sent you a card,

15:56.640 --> 15:58.880
and you had a significant other the whole time.

15:58.880 --> 15:59.440
Yeah.

15:59.440 --> 16:02.320
Oh, oh no, what a pickle.

16:02.320 --> 16:04.080
What a picky.

16:04.080 --> 16:06.000
You shouldn't do this thing.

16:07.120 --> 16:08.560
You shouldn't do this thing.

16:08.560 --> 16:11.840
I understand that not everybody's money situation is the same.

16:12.480 --> 16:13.760
God knows that's true.

16:13.760 --> 16:20.480
But this is, the amount that you are saving to enter yourself into,

16:20.480 --> 16:22.800
you're in the fucking hornet's nest right now,

16:22.800 --> 16:26.320
and you could easily not be in the hornet's nest by going to Walgreens,

16:26.320 --> 16:32.080
or taking a sheet of loose-leaf paper and doing your fucking best with some Crayola on it.

16:32.080 --> 16:33.280
That's even better.

16:33.280 --> 16:38.560
Now, Griffin, there is the line that the card is very fancy.

16:38.560 --> 16:39.920
Mmm.

16:39.920 --> 16:43.120
Very, maybe this is like a $12 card.

16:43.120 --> 16:46.240
Like, you open it up, and a video plays or something.

16:46.240 --> 16:47.280
Oh, that's good.

16:47.280 --> 16:49.760
Or you open it up, and it has a song like,

16:49.760 --> 16:51.600
come on and have some birthday fun.

16:53.440 --> 16:53.920
Or maybe-

16:53.920 --> 16:55.920
Are you ready for some birthday?

16:55.920 --> 17:00.080
What if there's a prerecorded thing in there, but you only hear it if you open it all the way?

17:00.640 --> 17:05.120
So your significant other gets it, and they open it all the way, and it's like,

17:05.120 --> 17:10.480
dear Philippe, we so treasure you, and we're sorry you're so terribly lonely.

17:10.480 --> 17:12.000
As alone as alone can be.

17:12.000 --> 17:15.840
Anyway, love you, your parents, who bought this card for you.

17:16.560 --> 17:17.120
Ugh.

17:17.120 --> 17:17.840
Can I ask you a question?

17:17.840 --> 17:19.280
Are you just maybe bored?

17:19.280 --> 17:23.840
And the idea of, for this $1.65 you could save yourself,

17:23.840 --> 17:28.000
you could potentially turn your life completely 180 around.

17:28.000 --> 17:33.680
Everyone who is close to you now feels jilted by you, and you dunk it right into the toilet.

17:33.680 --> 17:36.720
It's like you're looking at the power to destroy your entire life.

17:36.720 --> 17:38.720
Yeah, and it's seductive, that power, sometimes.

17:38.720 --> 17:39.520
God, it is.

17:39.520 --> 17:43.120
Yeah, like you have that button, it's like a self-destruct button,

17:43.120 --> 17:45.760
but it's like everyone else destruct button.

17:45.760 --> 17:46.260
Yeah.

17:47.760 --> 17:50.000
Maybe here's a great gift for your significant other.

17:50.000 --> 17:50.880
Okay.

17:50.880 --> 17:52.160
Tell your parents about them.

17:52.160 --> 17:54.160
Yeah, I'm sure they would appreciate that.

17:54.160 --> 17:57.680
I also feel like you could make your own shitty card on looseleaf,

17:57.680 --> 18:00.960
and write your own love message on it, and then you pull out the nice fancy card,

18:00.960 --> 18:03.440
and you start to hand it to them, and then you tear it up, and you say,

18:03.440 --> 18:07.040
no store-bought card is good enough to transmit my love thoughts to you.

18:07.040 --> 18:12.240
So you're gonna tear up the Valentine's Day card your parents got you?

18:12.800 --> 18:13.840
Yeah, no evidence.

18:13.840 --> 18:17.040
No, but the question-asker is also a great slide of ham addition,

18:17.040 --> 18:19.360
so they didn't really tear it up, Justin, don't worry.

18:19.360 --> 18:21.120
Oh, okay, I gotcha.

18:21.120 --> 18:21.440
They tore up the phone.

18:21.440 --> 18:22.560
And then a dove.

18:22.560 --> 18:23.760
Yeah, a dove comes out.

18:23.760 --> 18:25.360
A dove comes out.

18:25.360 --> 18:27.040
Here's a Yahoo that was sent in by Merit Palmer.

18:27.040 --> 18:28.720
Thank you, Merit, it's Yahoo Answers user.

18:28.720 --> 18:30.400
Hello, question mark, who asks?

18:31.360 --> 18:31.920
McFly.

18:31.920 --> 18:36.720
Can I start a gym called Goku, or would that be infringement?

18:36.720 --> 18:40.880
There would be no reference, or mascot, or anything similar DBZ.

18:40.880 --> 18:45.760
That stands for Dragon's Ball ZZ, zero.

18:46.720 --> 18:53.680
Then why, then I guess, do you just think, what a great name for a gym?

18:54.720 --> 18:59.680
Well, no Trav, I think you're gonna get brand recognition.

18:59.680 --> 19:05.440
But as long as you don't put the spiked man himself on there,

19:05.440 --> 19:10.640
doing his big, powerful yell, then I think you're probably gonna be okay, right?

19:10.640 --> 19:14.400
Goku's just a name, and what's in a name?

19:14.400 --> 19:16.880
A rose by any other name is still Goku.

19:16.880 --> 19:19.200
There's no good names for gyms.

19:20.080 --> 19:21.360
Think of a good name for them.

19:21.360 --> 19:27.440
The ones near my house include Planet Fit,

19:27.440 --> 19:35.440
that's bad, that's like, hey aliens, come here and get healthy, that's terrible.

19:35.440 --> 19:39.680
There's a 24 hour fitness center that closes at nine, that sucks.

19:39.680 --> 19:42.320
What about Beef City?

19:42.320 --> 19:45.200
Beef City sounds like a butcher shop, no way.

19:45.920 --> 19:49.200
Okay, how about Rippington's?

19:49.200 --> 19:50.640
That's good, hey can I suggest maybe-

19:50.640 --> 19:54.000
That sounds like an amazing vape shop, start over.

19:54.000 --> 19:57.360
Griffin, give me one good gym name, and I'll tear it down.

19:57.360 --> 19:58.480
I got a good one, you ready?

19:58.480 --> 19:58.980
Yes.

19:59.520 --> 20:02.800
Goku, what is, listen to the question, it's perfect.

20:02.800 --> 20:06.080
It's not even called Goku, no listen, it's not even called Goku's gym.

20:06.960 --> 20:09.200
It's called Goku.

20:09.200 --> 20:10.880
This gym is Goku.

20:11.600 --> 20:13.520
So hey, sorry honey, I'm gonna be late.

20:14.400 --> 20:17.040
I'm gonna stop at Goku after work.

20:17.040 --> 20:18.560
Yeah, yeah.

20:19.280 --> 20:21.760
I think actually without any context,

20:21.760 --> 20:25.600
it kind of sounds like a super high-end frozen yogurt shop.

20:25.600 --> 20:28.720
It does kind of sound like that, so what we're gonna need to

20:29.520 --> 20:33.120
express or communicate is that this is a place

20:33.120 --> 20:36.240
where the art of crafting muscles takes place.

20:36.880 --> 20:37.840
Sweaty Goku.

20:37.840 --> 20:40.720
I'm gonna call it, we're gonna call it the art of Goku.

20:41.600 --> 20:44.480
I think that is gonna get the message across

20:44.480 --> 20:46.480
that this is a place to be reckoned with

20:46.480 --> 20:49.120
if you want to put some beef on your bones.

20:49.120 --> 20:49.620
Yeah.

20:51.600 --> 20:54.240
What about just Goku Makers?

20:54.240 --> 20:55.680
Oh, I like that.

20:55.680 --> 20:57.920
That's a direct reference.

20:57.920 --> 21:02.480
Okay, Goku Maker one, he gets his power from the yellow sun.

21:02.480 --> 21:03.680
So that's not good.

21:03.680 --> 21:05.920
A real Goku Maker is the yellow sun.

21:05.920 --> 21:08.800
Secondly, that's a direct reference to this popular character,

21:08.800 --> 21:10.720
Goku from Dragon Ball Z.

21:10.720 --> 21:12.080
Well, so what about this?

21:12.080 --> 21:15.200
Because it would teach you like the art of getting buff, right?

21:15.200 --> 21:16.400
As you said, right?

21:16.400 --> 21:19.360
So what about Goku's Art Academy?

21:19.360 --> 21:22.080
Okay, I like this so far.

21:22.080 --> 21:24.240
That's it, that's the end of the thought, it's good, okay.

21:24.240 --> 21:26.400
Well, I figure, because here's the thing,

21:26.400 --> 21:28.720
at first you would show up with like paintbrush in hand

21:28.720 --> 21:30.160
and then you would say like, okay,

21:30.160 --> 21:32.800
now snap that paintbrush in half.

21:32.800 --> 21:33.920
That's lesson one.

21:34.880 --> 21:38.800
What if you have, what if it's called Goku, right?

21:38.800 --> 21:42.080
But then you also have a big neon sign up

21:42.080 --> 21:43.680
that says Vegeta next to it.

21:43.680 --> 21:45.840
Now listen, now listen, listen, listen, listen.

21:45.840 --> 21:48.960
When the people who own that property swing by

21:48.960 --> 21:52.800
to close you down or the copyright police or whatever,

21:52.800 --> 21:55.040
more neon letters click on,

21:55.040 --> 21:57.680
it's displaying the word vegetables.

21:59.200 --> 22:00.800
And then it's like you never even,

22:00.800 --> 22:03.520
it's like no, you're all good.

22:03.520 --> 22:06.240
You're talking about like a speakeasy gym.

22:06.240 --> 22:07.440
When you say it out loud,

22:07.440 --> 22:09.120
Vegeta sounds like a grandmother

22:09.120 --> 22:10.960
trying to order Mexican food.

22:10.960 --> 22:13.760
Kind of, I would like vegetables, excellent.

22:13.760 --> 22:15.680
Hey, give me one of them vegetas.

22:15.680 --> 22:17.920
I would also say it sounds like a six pack.

22:17.920 --> 22:19.200
I would say it sounds like a sixth grader

22:19.200 --> 22:20.960
trying to talk about a vagina.

22:20.960 --> 22:23.680
What are you doing at a gym?

22:23.680 --> 22:24.640
What are you doing?

22:24.640 --> 22:26.320
It's not about making muscles.

22:26.320 --> 22:27.440
Anyone can do that.

22:27.440 --> 22:27.840
No.

22:27.840 --> 22:30.080
What I think you're doing really at a gym

22:30.080 --> 22:31.520
is investing in yourself.

22:31.520 --> 22:33.040
It's about investment.

22:33.040 --> 22:34.720
So here's what I think you should do

22:34.720 --> 22:36.160
is call it Goku's bank.

22:36.720 --> 22:41.280
And that could be a little more palatable, I think.

22:42.080 --> 22:43.760
Because yeah, that's the thing is like,

22:43.760 --> 22:47.760
I think I don't know much about copyright infringement.

22:47.760 --> 22:48.080
Not much.

22:48.080 --> 22:50.880
But I'm pretty sure that if it doesn't compete

22:50.880 --> 22:53.920
with what the existing Goku is offering,

22:53.920 --> 22:55.840
you're probably fine, right?

22:56.720 --> 22:57.280
Yeah, right?

22:57.280 --> 23:00.320
Like I could start a store called Pepsi's Vegetables

23:00.320 --> 23:01.520
and I'd probably be cool.

23:03.120 --> 23:05.360
What if your gym had two doors?

23:05.360 --> 23:05.680
Okay.

23:07.680 --> 23:12.240
Can we just stop for a second

23:12.240 --> 23:14.080
and think about Pepsi's Vegetables?

23:14.960 --> 23:16.880
Yeah, let's give that one its fair.

23:16.880 --> 23:18.320
Let's give that one its due.

23:18.320 --> 23:19.840
It's just a powerful idea.

23:20.880 --> 23:24.320
I was running away from the warm pool of Pepsi's Vegetables.

23:24.320 --> 23:25.040
I'm gonna turn around,

23:25.040 --> 23:27.040
I'm gonna splash around there with you guys for a while.

23:27.040 --> 23:28.720
I mean, they can try to shut me down,

23:28.720 --> 23:30.640
but it's not like people are confusing

23:30.640 --> 23:32.560
my vegetables for their soda.

23:32.560 --> 23:33.040
That's right.

23:33.040 --> 23:34.560
These are Pepsi's Vegetables.

23:35.440 --> 23:37.680
These are my vegetables and I'm Pepsi.

23:38.560 --> 23:39.120
All right.

23:39.120 --> 23:41.280
Oh, legally change your name to Goku.

23:41.280 --> 23:43.120
And then call it Goku's gym.

23:43.120 --> 23:45.120
They can't fucking touch you.

23:45.120 --> 23:46.880
Yes, that's true.

23:46.880 --> 23:50.000
And legally make yourself look exactly like Goku.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.480
And then put a picture of yourself next to it.

23:52.480 --> 23:54.000
And learn to play the piccolo.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.200
I haven't seen the show.

23:55.200 --> 23:55.920
Haven't seen it.

23:55.920 --> 23:57.360
But maybe the gym has two doors

23:57.360 --> 23:59.360
and over one is a sign that says,

24:00.800 --> 24:02.720
this one's for not Goku's.

24:03.360 --> 24:05.920
And then the exit door, you can just leave that blank.

24:05.920 --> 24:06.560
You can put like,

24:06.560 --> 24:09.120
this one's for question mark, question mark, question marks.

24:09.120 --> 24:11.440
And then all you have on there is not Goku.

24:11.440 --> 24:12.160
That's true.

24:12.160 --> 24:13.120
And then you're saying,

24:13.120 --> 24:16.560
listen, I'm explicitly saying that I am not your property.

24:16.560 --> 24:18.640
I am not stealing your copyright.

24:18.640 --> 24:22.560
This is what I've opened here is like a not Kroger.

24:22.560 --> 24:23.680
This is, you know what I mean?

24:23.680 --> 24:24.160
Like, yes.

24:24.800 --> 24:25.520
God, I love it.

24:25.520 --> 24:28.160
I love it when Goku yells and energy comes out.

24:28.800 --> 24:29.120
Yeah.

24:29.840 --> 24:32.080
And he uses it to power the US

24:32.080 --> 24:35.120
so that we have less of a dependency on fossil fuels.

24:35.120 --> 24:36.080
Haven't seen the show.

24:36.080 --> 24:37.680
Hey, everybody can just real quick,

24:37.680 --> 24:38.560
just say it out loud.

24:38.560 --> 24:39.280
Thank you, Goku.

24:39.920 --> 24:42.160
Thank you, Goku.

24:42.160 --> 24:43.920
Gokyu.

24:43.920 --> 24:44.720
Is that a trademark?

24:44.720 --> 24:46.400
Can we put thank you, Goku on a t-shirt?

24:47.040 --> 24:47.280
Yeah.

24:48.320 --> 24:52.160
What if we put thank you and then in quotation marks,

24:52.160 --> 24:52.960
Gokyu.

24:59.120 --> 25:00.480
Oh, shit.

25:00.480 --> 25:02.400
God, Goku is so powerful.

25:02.400 --> 25:03.040
He's so good.

25:03.040 --> 25:04.640
He would be so good on a powerful t-shirt.

25:04.640 --> 25:06.640
He would make you look stronger just from wearing it.

25:06.640 --> 25:07.680
My wife, it's impossible.

25:07.680 --> 25:09.680
My wife is very thrifty and scolds me anytime I'm-

25:09.680 --> 25:14.400
My wife!

25:14.400 --> 25:17.120
Anytime I spend money unnecessarily.

25:17.120 --> 25:20.640
She recently suggested we pick up coffee at a local coffee shop

25:20.640 --> 25:22.720
as a treat to ourselves for penny pinching.

25:23.280 --> 25:26.080
The issue is I've been secretly shopping at this coffee shop

25:26.080 --> 25:27.200
at least once a week for over two years.

25:27.200 --> 25:28.800
Oh, my God.

25:28.800 --> 25:31.440
They know me by name and begin making my regular order

25:31.440 --> 25:33.200
before I get to the register.

25:33.200 --> 25:36.560
Had I warned the baristas to pretend like they don't know me

25:36.560 --> 25:40.720
so I won't be caught when I do go with my wife.

25:40.720 --> 25:42.480
When I do go with my wife.

25:42.480 --> 25:42.880
Yeah, sure.

25:42.880 --> 25:43.520
My wife.

25:43.520 --> 25:44.000
My wife.

25:44.560 --> 25:46.320
That's from regular in Redondo Beach.

25:46.320 --> 25:47.520
The Dondo.

25:47.520 --> 25:48.320
The Dondo.

25:49.920 --> 25:52.560
I wish you did more like shout outs to locations

25:52.560 --> 25:55.760
like the Dondo, call him in or something like that.

25:55.760 --> 25:58.320
I mean, the good thing about having IBS

25:58.320 --> 26:01.120
is that people just assume that you do have it all the time.

26:01.120 --> 26:03.680
So if you need to fake a tummy ache so that they,

26:03.680 --> 26:05.200
so your wife will go get the coffees

26:05.200 --> 26:06.960
and you could just chill at home and avoid the situation

26:06.960 --> 26:08.640
altogether, that's fine.

26:11.120 --> 26:13.920
Maybe just burst in and say like, I'm new here.

26:14.480 --> 26:15.760
Okay, they get your wife's credit card.

26:15.760 --> 26:16.960
They look at the name.

26:16.960 --> 26:19.200
Oh, you must be related to blah, blah, blah.

26:19.200 --> 26:20.400
He's in here every week.

26:21.040 --> 26:22.000
Oh, shit.

26:22.000 --> 26:22.800
Double life.

26:22.800 --> 26:24.640
You've apparently led a double life

26:24.640 --> 26:26.320
and your wife has found out about it

26:26.320 --> 26:28.720
when you're not even there to explain yourself.

26:28.720 --> 26:29.760
Yep, you're the one who knocks.

26:31.040 --> 26:32.640
What if you go in and then they're like,

26:32.640 --> 26:34.320
oh, it's our regular.

26:34.320 --> 26:36.400
I'll make you your vanilla latte.

26:36.400 --> 26:39.120
And you say, what the fuck are you talking about?

26:43.120 --> 26:46.880
Well, have you considered not lying?

26:46.880 --> 26:49.760
I was gonna say, it's almost like there's a very good reason

26:49.760 --> 26:51.200
why we shouldn't lie to people

26:51.200 --> 26:52.640
that share their lives with us.

26:53.280 --> 26:56.400
I feel like we've caught the bad end of that particular.

26:59.680 --> 27:01.120
Hold on, this is an opportunity for us

27:01.120 --> 27:04.160
to make a very salient, very helpful relationship tip.

27:04.160 --> 27:06.160
I feel like there's lots of people out there

27:06.160 --> 27:08.960
who have what they think is little secrets

27:08.960 --> 27:11.920
from their SO or their partner, whatever.

27:12.880 --> 27:14.560
But you do it so much, but you're like,

27:14.560 --> 27:16.400
it's okay, it's just little secrets.

27:16.400 --> 27:17.920
But then when your partner finds out about it,

27:17.920 --> 27:19.840
you are immediately confronted with the reality

27:19.840 --> 27:22.160
that, oh no, it's big secrets.

27:23.440 --> 27:26.160
It's kind of weird that I didn't clue them in.

27:26.160 --> 27:29.360
This is like if you embezzled a $1 every day

27:29.360 --> 27:31.120
from where you worked and you're like,

27:31.120 --> 27:32.640
oh, I'm just stealing $1.

27:32.640 --> 27:34.480
And then you work there for 30 years

27:34.480 --> 27:37.360
and you've stolen thousands and thousands of dollars?

27:37.360 --> 27:38.640
I should clear up.

27:38.640 --> 27:41.520
I'm not saying that there needs to be 100%.

27:42.800 --> 27:45.040
I'm not saying that you have to check in

27:45.040 --> 27:47.120
every time you wanna do something, right?

27:47.120 --> 27:48.720
I also do not think that that is the basis

27:48.720 --> 27:50.080
of a healthy relationship.

27:50.080 --> 27:51.440
It's just the nature of,

27:51.440 --> 27:53.680
it doesn't matter the size of the secret.

27:53.680 --> 27:58.400
When your SO finds out that you have a secret,

28:00.000 --> 28:01.200
there's a weird energy now.

28:01.200 --> 28:03.200
I celebrate the secret.

28:03.200 --> 28:05.200
I think it's fine to have a secret.

28:05.200 --> 28:07.120
I think it's good to have a little secret.

28:07.120 --> 28:08.960
But I think it should be the kind of little secret

28:08.960 --> 28:11.840
that if your SO finds out about it,

28:12.720 --> 28:14.080
then they don't give a shit.

28:15.440 --> 28:17.840
Or at most they kind of like roll their eyes.

28:17.840 --> 28:19.920
No, you're missing the point, Travis.

28:19.920 --> 28:22.400
If you try to make it something like you would want to hide,

28:22.400 --> 28:26.960
okay, I was like three weeks into my Coursera class

28:26.960 --> 28:29.120
about appreciating classical music

28:29.120 --> 28:32.000
before I told my wife that I was taking this class

28:32.000 --> 28:36.000
because she saw me and she didn't give a shit.

28:36.000 --> 28:36.960
Because who would?

28:36.960 --> 28:39.520
But it was my little private thing for a little while.

28:39.520 --> 28:43.040
That's my special class between me and this cat from Duke

28:43.040 --> 28:46.640
who has a lot of knowledge about classical music.

28:46.640 --> 28:48.240
It was our special thing, right?

28:48.240 --> 28:49.760
And I didn't tell my wife about it

28:49.760 --> 28:51.040
because it was my little secret

28:51.040 --> 28:53.360
that she wouldn't give an ever-loving shit about.

28:53.360 --> 28:54.160
Yeah.

28:54.160 --> 28:56.640
See, what I do is I routinely,

28:56.640 --> 28:58.560
I will overspend on something

28:58.560 --> 29:00.560
and when Teresa and I first started dating,

29:00.560 --> 29:03.600
I knew that she would be upset

29:03.600 --> 29:05.840
that I went to, say, the grocery store

29:05.840 --> 29:09.280
and bought a bunch of impulse buy items and spent too much.

29:09.280 --> 29:13.200
So I would routinely just cut money off of how much I spent

29:13.200 --> 29:15.200
and say, yeah, I only spent whatever.

29:15.200 --> 29:17.200
And then one day what I did is I told her

29:17.200 --> 29:18.800
that I was doing that.

29:18.800 --> 29:23.120
And so now I still do it, but she knows I'm doing it.

29:23.120 --> 29:26.320
So it's like a lie, but it's not.

29:26.320 --> 29:28.800
But also we both agree that it's better this way.

29:28.800 --> 29:29.760
It's called Big Secrets.

29:29.760 --> 29:31.600
How completely psychopathic, Trav Gray.

29:31.600 --> 29:32.560
Thanks for sharing.

29:32.560 --> 29:34.480
No, because then she knows that I round town.

29:34.480 --> 29:37.760
How absolutely baffling is it?

29:37.760 --> 29:40.960
Is it Justin or is it normal?

29:41.600 --> 29:43.120
That's a jagged little pill right there, bud.

29:45.600 --> 29:47.440
I've never done what you guys have talked about.

29:47.440 --> 29:48.960
Your secret, your classical music,

29:48.960 --> 29:51.360
your Mozart perversions.

29:53.120 --> 29:54.560
I'm actually not to Mozart yet.

29:54.560 --> 29:57.440
I kind of got hung up around Bach because I don't like his stuff.

29:59.600 --> 30:02.160
You know he wrote 30 minutes of new-

30:02.160 --> 30:03.760
Hold on, MoneyZune Kuwait.

30:03.760 --> 30:04.640
MoneyZune?

30:04.640 --> 30:06.000
Is Zune one of our sponsors?

30:06.000 --> 30:07.200
The MoneyZune Kuwait.

30:08.080 --> 30:14.320
Bach wrote a new 30 minute piece of music every week.

30:16.480 --> 30:19.040
But that was easy when there wasn't other music.

30:19.040 --> 30:21.120
He could just be like, bing, bing, bing, bing.

30:21.120 --> 30:21.920
That's a new one.

30:21.920 --> 30:22.960
That's a new one.

30:22.960 --> 30:24.880
They've always done that one before.

30:27.120 --> 30:27.920
That's a new one.

30:27.920 --> 30:30.400
It's for at least two.

30:30.400 --> 30:31.840
Huff my nuts, Beethoven.

30:31.840 --> 30:36.880
It's for at least two.

30:36.880 --> 30:37.840
That's a new one.

30:37.840 --> 30:39.200
Do that for 30 minutes.

30:39.200 --> 30:40.960
He didn't, Justin, to be fair,

30:40.960 --> 30:43.840
he didn't say he wrote 30 minutes of good music every week.

30:44.640 --> 30:46.640
He also wrote 30 minutes of lyrics to that music,

30:46.640 --> 30:47.840
but they made him cut it every time

30:47.840 --> 30:49.200
because of how dog shit it was.

30:49.200 --> 30:55.200
And the dragons come over the crest of the ridge

30:55.200 --> 30:59.040
and the sunlight sword hangs above them.

30:59.040 --> 31:00.160
Bach, please.

31:00.800 --> 31:02.640
We have talked to you so many times,

31:02.640 --> 31:04.960
we love the music so much,

31:04.960 --> 31:06.800
but your lyrics are,

31:06.800 --> 31:11.360
and the white wolves gather at the edge of the sunlight.

31:11.360 --> 31:12.080
All right, Bach.

31:12.720 --> 31:15.440
I just feel like you're using a lot of weird imagery.

31:16.160 --> 31:16.640
It's not.

31:16.640 --> 31:20.000
Run, run your fingers through my curly white hair.

31:20.640 --> 31:23.280
Bach, Bach, we're not ready for this.

31:23.280 --> 31:24.800
Our great, great, great, great green kids

31:24.800 --> 31:26.240
are gonna eat that shit up.

31:26.240 --> 31:27.200
Yeah, they're gonna love it.

31:27.200 --> 31:30.240
But all this stuff about like reaching the peak of the mountain

31:30.240 --> 31:31.680
and soaring with the eagles,

31:31.680 --> 31:33.040
we're not into that right now.

31:33.040 --> 31:36.640
Could you please just, I don't know, talk about flowers?

31:36.640 --> 31:37.680
I think we like that.

31:37.680 --> 31:38.480
Can we all agree?

31:38.480 --> 31:40.000
Flowers, maybe spring?

31:40.000 --> 31:40.880
We're into spring.

31:41.600 --> 31:45.120
And the flowers spring from the mouth of all the virgins

31:45.120 --> 31:47.280
as they ride upon their dragons.

31:47.280 --> 31:47.780
Whoa.

31:49.360 --> 31:49.920
Damn it.

31:49.920 --> 31:50.800
From their eyes.

31:51.440 --> 31:52.480
Nope, nope, nope, nope.

31:52.480 --> 31:55.280
And when I look into your eyes,

31:55.920 --> 31:58.320
you put me in my grave.

31:58.320 --> 31:59.120
No, Bach.

32:00.320 --> 32:02.960
The dragons in my love grave.

32:02.960 --> 32:04.000
What, no, what?

32:04.000 --> 32:08.000
With their incredible laser rifles.

32:08.000 --> 32:08.720
Wait, wait.

32:08.720 --> 32:09.200
What?

32:09.200 --> 32:10.160
Holy shit.

32:10.160 --> 32:10.880
What?

32:10.880 --> 32:14.400
The robot overlords I see in my dreams.

32:14.400 --> 32:15.920
Bach, what the fuck?

32:15.920 --> 32:16.800
What the shit are you on?

32:16.800 --> 32:18.480
Anyway, are you cool?

32:18.480 --> 32:19.360
30 minutes of music.

32:19.920 --> 32:21.680
We put an hour of podcast.

32:21.680 --> 32:23.200
Yeah, and some weeks we skip.

32:25.840 --> 32:28.080
Because we can't, because we're tired.

32:28.080 --> 32:40.240
Anyway, let's go to the mighty dance.

32:40.240 --> 32:41.520
Hey, can I tell you all about schtomps?

32:42.320 --> 32:42.820
Yeah.

32:42.820 --> 32:45.060
Yeah, I love these things.

32:45.060 --> 32:48.660
Do you guys like art and pictures and drawings?

32:48.660 --> 32:49.220
Yes.

32:49.220 --> 32:51.300
What if you could get them really little and sticky

32:51.300 --> 32:54.420
and allow them to make your mail go from where you have it now

32:54.420 --> 32:55.860
to where you want it to go?

32:55.860 --> 32:56.980
Oh, okay.

32:56.980 --> 32:58.820
And then it's like you're giving somebody art,

32:58.820 --> 33:00.580
but you're also giving them the mail

33:00.580 --> 33:01.620
that you need to get in their hands.

33:01.620 --> 33:04.340
Do you know that stamps are picked by CSAC,

33:04.340 --> 33:05.940
the Citizen Stamp Advisory Committee?

33:06.500 --> 33:08.100
And it's a secret organization

33:08.820 --> 33:11.380
that the public isn't allowed any insight into.

33:11.380 --> 33:14.260
And these 12 non-postal worker employees

33:14.260 --> 33:15.700
pick them all in secret?

33:15.700 --> 33:16.660
I did not know that.

33:16.660 --> 33:18.740
But what I do know is that if you don't want to go

33:18.740 --> 33:20.180
to the post office to get your stamps,

33:20.180 --> 33:21.940
then stamps.com has you covered

33:21.940 --> 33:23.300
because they have all the services

33:23.300 --> 33:26.420
of the US Postal Service right at your fingertips.

33:26.420 --> 33:28.660
I'm talking about printing your own postage

33:28.660 --> 33:30.900
for any letter, any package, any class of mail

33:30.900 --> 33:32.900
using your own computer and printer.

33:32.900 --> 33:33.940
And they save you money too

33:33.940 --> 33:35.220
because they got postage discounts

33:35.220 --> 33:36.500
you can't get at the post office,

33:36.500 --> 33:38.900
including five cents off every first class stamp.

33:38.900 --> 33:41.300
And that shit adds up though.

33:41.300 --> 33:43.380
They also are not allowed to have alcohol

33:43.380 --> 33:47.060
or cigarettes or firearms on stamps.

33:47.060 --> 33:49.060
So if you look at like Betty Davis's stamp,

33:49.060 --> 33:51.540
they photoshopped out her cigarette.

33:52.100 --> 33:53.300
If you check out her stamp,

33:53.300 --> 33:53.940
it looks like she's holding a cigarette.

33:53.940 --> 33:55.300
They replaced it with a carrot.

33:55.300 --> 33:56.500
There's no cigarette there.

33:56.500 --> 33:59.380
I heard a lot of stamp stuff on every little thing

33:59.940 --> 34:01.460
and I just wanted to share it all with you guys.

34:02.100 --> 34:03.140
Okay, well.

34:03.140 --> 34:03.940
Cool.

34:03.940 --> 34:06.500
I just found out that I can't get the gun stamps I wanted

34:06.500 --> 34:07.780
so you've really peed me oh.

34:07.780 --> 34:10.260
Sorry about being your oh, clean out.

34:10.260 --> 34:12.260
But anyway, stamps.com is great.

34:13.060 --> 34:15.220
It's a very, very convenient way to get your postage

34:15.220 --> 34:19.060
if you, like me, don't like going to the post office

34:19.060 --> 34:22.420
because it's far away and also anxiety.

34:22.420 --> 34:25.380
Right now our listeners get a free special offer

34:25.380 --> 34:27.220
that includes a four week trial

34:29.700 --> 34:31.220

35:00.020 --> 35:01.700
That's a tagline, baby.

35:01.700 --> 35:03.300
I feel like I can get it under two words.

35:03.940 --> 35:04.820
Website?

35:04.820 --> 35:05.780
Question mark.

35:05.780 --> 35:06.820
Squarespace.

35:06.820 --> 35:08.020
I can do it in one.

35:08.020 --> 35:08.520
Okay.

35:09.860 --> 35:10.740
Webspace.

35:11.460 --> 35:14.260
Ooh, I think I could do it in one letter.

35:15.300 --> 35:16.020
W?

35:16.020 --> 35:18.260
Okay, so that's Squarespace ad

35:18.260 --> 35:20.820
and that'll be $50, please.

35:22.500 --> 35:24.420
That's not actually the Squarespace ad.

35:24.420 --> 35:26.180
Travis has a real one that he'd like to tell you about.

35:26.180 --> 35:27.060
Yeah, so here's the thing.

35:27.060 --> 35:30.900
Squarespace, listen, we live in the digital age.

35:30.900 --> 35:32.420
Everything's digital these days.

35:32.420 --> 35:36.340
If you want to have a successful business,

35:36.340 --> 35:37.940
you have to have an online presence.

35:37.940 --> 35:39.940
If you want to be a cool hip artist,

35:39.940 --> 35:41.380
you have to have an online presence.

35:41.380 --> 35:43.540
If you want to be just about anything,

35:43.540 --> 35:45.060
you need to have an online presence

35:45.060 --> 35:46.260
and you don't need to know anything

35:46.260 --> 35:48.580
about making websites to do with Squarespace

35:48.580 --> 35:50.900
because Squarespace, it's easy to set up.

35:50.900 --> 35:52.260

36:13.460 --> 36:15.700
You just got me so psyched with all that stuff.

36:15.700 --> 36:17.060
I know, but I have like a flow

36:17.060 --> 36:18.020
and now I have to start over.

36:18.900 --> 36:20.100
It's a digital age.

36:20.100 --> 36:20.900
Fuck, I forgot.

36:22.020 --> 36:22.740
Nice, dude.

36:23.860 --> 36:26.500

36:35.380 --> 36:37.060
There's nothing quite like sailing

36:37.060 --> 36:40.020
in the calm international waters on my ship,

36:40.020 --> 36:41.300
the SS Biopic.

36:42.260 --> 36:43.220
Avast!

36:43.220 --> 36:46.660
It's actually pronounced biopic.

36:46.660 --> 36:48.260
No, you dingus!

36:48.260 --> 36:49.380
It's biopic!

36:49.380 --> 36:50.900
Who the hell says that?

36:50.900 --> 36:52.500
It's biopic.

36:52.500 --> 36:55.540
It comes with the words biography and picture.

36:56.420 --> 36:57.780
All right, that is enough.

36:57.780 --> 36:59.380
Ahoy, I'm Dave Holmes.

36:59.380 --> 37:02.100
I'm the host of the newly rebooted podcast,

37:02.100 --> 37:04.340
formerly known as International Waters,

37:04.340 --> 37:08.020
designed to resolve petty but persistent arguments like this.

37:08.020 --> 37:08.740
How?

37:08.740 --> 37:11.220
By pitting two teams of opinionated comedians

37:11.220 --> 37:14.580
against each other with trivia and improv games, of course,

37:14.580 --> 37:17.060
winner takes home the right to be right.

37:17.060 --> 37:18.740
What podcast be this?

37:18.740 --> 37:20.180
It's called Troubled Waters,

37:20.180 --> 37:22.180
where we disagree to disagree.

37:23.540 --> 37:24.980
So I got Yahoo.

37:26.420 --> 37:26.980
Yeah.

37:26.980 --> 37:28.500
So this one was sent in by Merritt Palmer.

37:28.500 --> 37:29.700
I don't know if it's good jokes,

37:29.700 --> 37:31.300
but I feel like we need to talk about it

37:31.300 --> 37:33.540
because it's from an anonymous Yahoo Answers user

37:33.540 --> 37:36.340
who I'm gonna call Nancy, who asks,

37:37.380 --> 37:41.540
is dessert its own meal or is it a part of dinner?

37:43.460 --> 37:48.580
Is it a thing of its own or is it just dinner's sweet hat?

37:49.460 --> 37:53.380
My first inclination is to say it is a thing of its own.

37:53.380 --> 37:58.020
Mm. But then I also think it would be really weird

37:58.020 --> 38:03.300
to just skip dinner and have dessert at like 7 p.m.

38:04.500 --> 38:08.420
I, it's 3 p.m. I have finished lunch long ago.

38:08.420 --> 38:11.300
I reach into my cookie drawer and I retrieve Oreos

38:11.300 --> 38:12.020
and eat them.

38:12.020 --> 38:13.300
That is a snack.

38:13.300 --> 38:17.140
I have just finished my dinner of ham at 8 p.m.

38:17.140 --> 38:18.340
and I reach into the cookie drawer,

38:18.340 --> 38:19.140
pull out Oreos, I eat it.

38:19.140 --> 38:20.020
That's a dessert.

38:20.020 --> 38:26.660
Yeah, if you have something sweet without dinner,

38:27.380 --> 38:28.260
it's not dessert.

38:28.900 --> 38:29.220
No.

38:29.220 --> 38:29.940
It's excess.

38:30.820 --> 38:31.700
It's a snack.

38:31.700 --> 38:32.420
It's a snack.

38:33.060 --> 38:33.940
It's Snackcess.

38:35.220 --> 38:36.740
No, we don't need to do that.

38:36.740 --> 38:38.340
Snackcess Hollywood.

38:38.340 --> 38:39.380
You don't need to do that.

38:39.380 --> 38:41.540
I'm just saying if you have dessert without dinner,

38:41.540 --> 38:42.820
it's not dessert.

38:43.380 --> 38:44.180
It's a snack.

38:44.740 --> 38:46.580
It's a sweet snack, okay?

38:46.580 --> 38:49.700
If you, I, here's the problem though.

38:50.500 --> 38:53.780
I like my dessert later in the evening.

38:53.780 --> 38:56.260
I don't like to have my dessert directly after dinner.

38:56.260 --> 38:57.940
I like to let it settle a little bit.

38:58.420 --> 38:58.740
Yeah.

38:58.740 --> 38:59.240
Okay?

38:59.700 --> 39:00.660
Is that dessert?

39:00.660 --> 39:02.580
If you've choked a little herb,

39:02.580 --> 39:04.100
a little post dinner kush.

39:04.100 --> 39:06.180
I think maybe that's fourth meal, Justin.

39:06.180 --> 39:06.660
Is that?

39:06.660 --> 39:07.940
Or 3.5 meal?

39:07.940 --> 39:11.140
Is that dessert if I wait until 10 o'clock?

39:11.860 --> 39:12.820
It's not dessert, right?

39:12.820 --> 39:13.460
Yeah.

39:13.460 --> 39:14.420
No, that's dessert.

39:14.420 --> 39:15.700
That's dessert still, yeah.

39:15.700 --> 39:16.980
Here, let me counterpoint.

39:16.980 --> 39:19.300
And that whole time you were chilling and getting blazed,

39:19.300 --> 39:20.900
that was all dinner.

39:20.900 --> 39:23.700
You were still in dinner that whole time.

39:23.700 --> 39:25.780
You had some additional vegetables.

39:25.780 --> 39:26.420
Yeah.

39:26.420 --> 39:28.020
It was your weed stuff.

39:28.020 --> 39:29.300
Now look, here's it,

39:29.300 --> 39:32.020
but to anybody who says dessert is part of dinner,

39:32.020 --> 39:33.060
let me throw this out.

39:33.060 --> 39:35.540
I bring you a plate that I've made you for dinner,

39:35.540 --> 39:39.460
and there on the plate is a really well cooked chicken breast,

39:39.460 --> 39:43.460
maybe some steamed broccoli, and an Oreo.

39:43.460 --> 39:49.300
And an Oreo on the same plate as dinner.

39:49.300 --> 39:50.180
Weird, huh?

39:50.740 --> 39:53.220
This is a bad dinner you've made for me, Travis.

39:53.220 --> 39:56.660
I get that, but I'm saying that Oreo doesn't belong there

39:56.660 --> 39:58.500
because that should come at a separate time.

39:58.500 --> 40:01.140
But at the same time, when I go out to a fancy restaurant

40:01.140 --> 40:03.460
and I'm having lunch with all of my famous friends,

40:03.460 --> 40:06.580
James Vanderbeek and the rest,

40:06.580 --> 40:09.540
when we are eating all of the great dinner food

40:09.540 --> 40:10.900
and then they say, would you like dessert?

40:10.900 --> 40:12.980
I've already filled my tummy up with all the great dinner food

40:12.980 --> 40:14.420
because I forgot about dessert.

40:14.420 --> 40:19.300
If they brought the dinner and the sweet tiramisu

40:19.300 --> 40:22.260
on the same plate to my table when it's dinner time,

40:23.220 --> 40:26.420
oh y'all, it's like a kid cuisine.

40:26.420 --> 40:28.900
Griffin, we're not talking about what it should be.

40:28.900 --> 40:30.500
We're talking about what it is.

40:30.500 --> 40:32.900
Can I pitch my adult kid cuisines

40:32.900 --> 40:34.980
at restaurants that you can get, please?

40:34.980 --> 40:36.580
But that's just called cuisine.

40:36.580 --> 40:44.580
What do you think a waiter or anybody at a restaurant

40:44.580 --> 40:49.460
would do if you said, yes, I'm going to have the ribeye

40:49.460 --> 40:52.260
and the baked potato and later I'm gonna want

40:52.260 --> 40:56.340
the brownie lava explosion, so just put it on the same plate.

40:57.540 --> 40:59.540
I feel like that's what Applebee's whole thing is

40:59.540 --> 41:01.140
because they don't give a fuck.

41:01.140 --> 41:01.860
That is true.

41:01.860 --> 41:02.660
They don't give a fuck.

41:02.660 --> 41:04.660
Everything's sizzling in the same skillet

41:04.660 --> 41:06.980
to save on doing dishes later.

41:07.700 --> 41:11.460
Applebee's will bring you some pudding shooters

41:11.460 --> 41:15.060
and then they'll bring you a garlic man,

41:15.060 --> 41:18.580
which is a man they make out of a whole garlic bulb,

41:18.580 --> 41:22.660
two lobster tails and a steak and three breadsticks.

41:22.660 --> 41:23.780
And he is sentient.

41:23.780 --> 41:25.860
And he is sentient and you have to chase him and eat him.

41:25.860 --> 41:28.500
And then finally they bring you your drink last

41:28.500 --> 41:30.660
because they are absolute what?

41:30.660 --> 41:38.500
What's the third breadstick?

41:38.500 --> 41:39.860
Why are you so nasty today?

41:39.860 --> 41:41.940
I can't believe you're making fun of me for that.

41:41.940 --> 41:44.420
Justin, I want you to try and imagine trying to stand up

41:44.420 --> 41:45.860
this meat man that I've talked about

41:45.860 --> 41:47.780
using just the two breadstick legs.

41:47.780 --> 41:49.780
A tripod is a way more secure foundation

41:49.780 --> 41:52.580
and I knew that when I was saying that shit on the phone.

41:52.580 --> 41:53.780
Where is the tripod?

41:53.780 --> 41:55.460
Where's the kickstand leg of the tripod?

41:55.460 --> 41:56.900
Towards the back like a tail.

41:56.900 --> 41:57.940
What's up now?

41:57.940 --> 41:59.380
And then two on the corners.

41:59.380 --> 42:01.380
Okay, good.

42:01.380 --> 42:02.260
Not like a penis.

42:02.260 --> 42:04.740
Not like a penis.

42:04.740 --> 42:04.980
Yeah.

42:04.980 --> 42:07.860
Unless it's a fun prank Herb, you know.

42:07.860 --> 42:10.500
You can request it that way, but you better tip well.

42:10.500 --> 42:12.180
Yeah, they'll do it sometimes for you know,

42:12.180 --> 42:13.460
like stag parties and stuff.

42:13.460 --> 42:14.500
Yeah, or birthday.

42:15.140 --> 42:18.260
Man, I want to have my bachelor party at Babblebee's.

42:18.260 --> 42:19.700
We've talked a lot of bullshit.

42:19.700 --> 42:21.860
I feel like dessert's part of dinner though.

42:21.860 --> 42:24.500
What if it's actually the beginning of breakfast?

42:24.500 --> 42:25.140
Whoa.

42:25.140 --> 42:27.860
Here's a sneak preview of what breakfast is gonna be like.

42:27.860 --> 42:30.180
Yeah, hey, because you know when sweet goes?

42:30.180 --> 42:30.980
Breakfast.

42:30.980 --> 42:32.180
Sweet flies at breakfast.

42:32.180 --> 42:32.900
Yeah, sweet's good at breakfast.

42:32.900 --> 42:33.780
Sweet doesn't fly at dinner.

42:33.780 --> 42:35.860
It's like a trailer for breakfast.

42:35.860 --> 42:39.060
Yeah, hey, and when you wake up, there's more where that came from.

42:39.700 --> 42:43.220
Hey, speaking of this, I want a munch.

42:44.020 --> 42:44.660
Okay.

42:44.660 --> 42:45.140
Scarred.

42:46.020 --> 42:47.300
You guys have to say squad.

42:47.300 --> 42:48.420
Did you say squarred?

42:48.980 --> 42:49.380
Scarred.

42:49.380 --> 42:49.620
Hit it.

42:49.620 --> 42:51.700
Hit that funky music.

42:51.700 --> 42:52.340
I want a munch.

42:52.900 --> 42:53.540
Squarred.

42:53.540 --> 42:53.700
Okay.

42:55.380 --> 42:56.260
I have two.

42:56.260 --> 42:59.220
I'm just gonna read the first line of this one, even though it's really good.

42:59.860 --> 43:04.500
This is McDonald's adds donut sticks to breakfast lineup.

43:05.780 --> 43:10.820
And the first line of this is, roses are red, violets are blue.

43:11.700 --> 43:14.340
The rumors of donut sticks coming to McDonald's are true.

43:15.060 --> 43:15.540
Okay.

43:16.740 --> 43:17.940
You've heard the buzz.

43:17.940 --> 43:18.420
That's good.

43:18.420 --> 43:21.140
Hey, I didn't know Robert Frost was still alive.

43:21.140 --> 43:22.980
He is, and he works for McDonald's.

43:22.980 --> 43:24.180
Robert Frosty.

43:24.180 --> 43:25.780
I'm the new Hamburglar.

43:25.780 --> 43:26.500
Okay, Robert.

43:26.500 --> 43:26.980
Okay.

43:26.980 --> 43:27.700
Calm down.

43:27.700 --> 43:28.900
Yes, that's happening.

43:28.900 --> 43:30.740
Nothing delicious can stay.

43:32.740 --> 43:35.140
I'll take the number two less eaten by.

43:35.860 --> 43:40.180
But I want to talk about, this is actually extremely important and challenging.

43:40.900 --> 43:47.860
Domino's new platform rewards points for competitors pizza.

43:49.300 --> 43:49.700
Listen.

43:50.340 --> 43:51.140
Okay.

43:51.140 --> 43:52.660
They announced this during the Super Bowl.

43:52.660 --> 43:58.980
Starting a February 2nd, Domino's began awarding points for all pizza customers.

44:00.340 --> 44:04.820
All pizza customers eat through its new points for pies program.

44:04.820 --> 44:05.780
The big catch.

44:05.780 --> 44:09.860
This includes competitors pizza, not just Domino's.

44:09.860 --> 44:15.540
Listen, instead of advertising during Sunday's game, we decided to invest in a breakthrough

44:15.540 --> 44:20.420
program that rewards everyone who loves pizza as much as we do, says someone.

44:20.420 --> 44:25.620
We know everyone is asking themselves, did Domino's just say they will award points for

44:25.620 --> 44:28.900
eating any pizza, even from a competitor?

44:28.900 --> 44:30.180
That's accurate.

44:30.980 --> 44:39.940
This new app will scan anything and say that it is pizza, or not pizza, obviously.

44:40.740 --> 44:46.740
Its internal teams developed pizza identifier capable of scanning each pizza or slice.

44:46.740 --> 44:51.860
It then uses artificial intelligence-driven software to identify the image.

44:52.580 --> 44:56.340
Quote, this is the first time Domino's is using AI technology like this.

44:56.340 --> 44:58.980
I hope so.

44:58.980 --> 44:59.940
Let's fucking hope so.

45:00.820 --> 45:03.780
And also, I hope that that's, okay.

45:04.580 --> 45:07.060
I hope it's the last time, but it won't be.

45:08.020 --> 45:13.300
It will be running the pizza identification process and is already smart enough to identify

45:13.300 --> 45:14.260
all pizza.

45:14.260 --> 45:19.940
Even if it's a homemade English muffin pizza, a pizza with a hot dog stuffed crust, or a

45:19.940 --> 45:21.780
high-end artisan pizza.

45:21.780 --> 45:25.780
It can even identify if it's a dog squeaky pizza toy.

45:25.780 --> 45:29.460
Hey, um, Dennis, that's not pizza dog.

45:29.460 --> 45:30.740
Are you okay?

45:30.740 --> 45:34.100
Because it sounds like you just proven that your robot can be easily fooled.

45:34.100 --> 45:40.900
Justin, Justin, I don't want to skip ahead, but is there a part in this press release

45:40.900 --> 45:45.780
where they say, and we don't know why we've done this, we hope that will reveal itself

45:45.780 --> 45:46.580
to us later.

45:46.580 --> 45:48.660
What's the points for though?

45:48.660 --> 45:57.380
You can scan other pizzas and get pizza points, or piz points, as I've decided to call them.

45:57.380 --> 45:58.660
Pizzies, pizzers.

45:58.660 --> 46:03.940
You can get pizzies or piz points, and then you can exchange those piz points for more

46:03.940 --> 46:05.540
piz at Domino's.

46:05.540 --> 46:07.540
So, okay.

46:07.540 --> 46:08.660
I can't do that.

46:08.660 --> 46:12.900
So, okay, I can't tell if that's good or bad.

46:12.900 --> 46:14.580
It seems not great.

46:14.580 --> 46:17.620
Well, Domino's has really turned their shit around, is what they want you to believe,

46:17.620 --> 46:22.340
but it's still, Domino's is okay, but you go around taking pictures of pizza like you're

46:22.340 --> 46:27.620
in fucking Pokemon Snap, and then you go to the Domino's and show them your camera roll,

46:27.620 --> 46:31.300
and you just kind of swipe through it, and they say, yep, yep, yep, circle with little

46:31.300 --> 46:35.140
circles on it, yep, yep, yep, here's a pizza, and you can take a picture of that, and then

46:35.140 --> 46:36.100
it never ends?

46:36.100 --> 46:37.460
No, you dummy.

46:37.460 --> 46:40.260
There's, the employees aren't part of it.

46:40.260 --> 46:45.940
There's a robot that lives in your phone, and it beams the image to the cloud, and the

46:45.940 --> 46:52.820
AI, the pizza bot that lives in the cloud, identifies things as being pizza or not pizza.

46:52.820 --> 46:58.500
We're training robots to perfectly identify what things are pizza.

46:58.500 --> 47:05.540
How bad is Domino's doing right now that there was a board meeting where they brought in

47:05.540 --> 47:11.620
the folks in R&D and said, hey, are people even still eating pizza?

47:11.620 --> 47:13.780
Is there any way we could figure this out?

47:13.780 --> 47:16.900
Fuck, guys, it's all about hot dogs now, fuck!

47:16.900 --> 47:17.940
What can we do?

47:17.940 --> 47:22.020
What do we do to figure out who's even eating pizza anymore?

47:22.020 --> 47:30.260
Maybe the chefs at Domino's are like, listen, guys, I have no fucking clue what we're doing

47:30.260 --> 47:32.980
here, I don't even know if this is pizza.

47:32.980 --> 47:38.980
I wish there was a way we could get billions of people to send us pictures of other pizza

47:38.980 --> 47:40.980
so we could just copy what they did.

47:41.540 --> 47:42.740
Can we just do that?

47:42.740 --> 47:48.100
I'm glad that they made a robot do it, because I wouldn't want to be the human being responsible

47:48.100 --> 47:54.660
for looking at a picture of something someone sent to Domino's that wasn't pizza.

47:55.540 --> 48:01.300
Because, god, the idea of what someone might take a picture of that's not pizza to send

48:01.300 --> 48:05.700
to Domino's terrifies me to the core of my being.

48:05.700 --> 48:08.340
That robot's gonna see some stuff, though.

48:08.340 --> 48:08.740
Yeah.

48:08.740 --> 48:12.820
Ooh, could you make a pizza out of robot parts?

48:13.940 --> 48:17.300
So then you send it the picture and you're like, no, look at it.

48:17.300 --> 48:19.460
I don't want to, look at it.

48:19.460 --> 48:21.620
This is not pizza, this is crime.

48:21.620 --> 48:23.220
Are you sure it's not pizza?

48:23.780 --> 48:27.220
Look again, it's shaped like pizza, right?

48:27.220 --> 48:27.780
It's got little-

48:27.780 --> 48:29.620
This is not pizza, this is sister.

48:29.620 --> 48:36.180
I cut this robo, you know, I cut its eyeballs off into slices and put it on there.

48:36.180 --> 48:37.620
So that's pepperoni, isn't it?

48:37.620 --> 48:40.580
I mean, if you're gonna prove chew toys, you gotta prove this, right?

48:40.580 --> 48:41.780
Call it pizza.

48:41.780 --> 48:43.460
It's pizza.

48:43.460 --> 48:45.380
I am pizza.

48:48.100 --> 48:53.380
The sweet relief you would feel after exploding after seeing tens of thousands of pictures

48:53.380 --> 48:57.620
of dudes just, like, spread out assholes that they sent to Domino's.

48:57.620 --> 48:59.140
That's what kink.

48:59.140 --> 49:01.540
The end of The Matrix is weird, huh?

49:02.100 --> 49:05.860
It all ends up the same, all the simulations in the same way.

49:05.860 --> 49:08.660
I don't get it.

49:08.660 --> 49:13.220
I sent a picture of my asshole to the robot so I hope Papa John sees it.

49:13.220 --> 49:15.060
What the fuck are you talking about?

49:16.500 --> 49:18.260
I'm on the hunt for a part-

49:18.260 --> 49:19.940
Enjoy my asshole, robot.

49:22.260 --> 49:23.460
Dude, dude, smack it.

49:23.460 --> 49:28.980
I'm in the hunt for a part-time job and getting really frustrated.

49:28.980 --> 49:32.100
I once worked at a seafood buffet and it's since been closed.

49:32.100 --> 49:34.340
I only worked there over the summers as a bus person.

49:38.900 --> 49:41.700
All aboard, all aboard me.

49:41.700 --> 49:42.980
I have transformed.

49:44.180 --> 49:46.980
I'll try not to sneeze and transform back in the middle.

49:47.780 --> 49:49.460
That happens a lot on Transformers.

49:49.460 --> 49:53.540
Cleaning up after tourists on a crab leg bender is hard work.

49:53.540 --> 49:58.180
My question is this, since it's closed, can I lie to any possible employers

49:58.180 --> 50:01.220
and say I worked there for way longer and in a higher paid position?

50:01.780 --> 50:05.460
The restaurant is a boat store now and no one knows where the others went,

50:05.460 --> 50:08.980
the owners went, so there's no way to verify my story of employment as far as I know.

50:08.980 --> 50:11.380
It's a harmless grift or a greedy scheme.

50:11.380 --> 50:13.460
That's from willing to work in Wilmington.

50:14.100 --> 50:17.060
Man, I didn't mean to make the first three questions about lying,

50:17.060 --> 50:20.340
but man, here we are, huh? Happy Valentine's Day.

50:20.340 --> 50:22.340
Yeah, you sound more like a Decepticon to me.

50:23.700 --> 50:24.820
Yeah, you're all good here.

50:25.620 --> 50:26.980
This one passed my smell test.

50:26.980 --> 50:28.740
I think you're all good to lie about this one.

50:28.740 --> 50:33.060
You can say you were president of Crab Legs and that you worked there for 18 years.

50:33.700 --> 50:38.500
If the previous owners of this restaurant were murdered by the boatmen,

50:38.500 --> 50:40.660
then they're not going to be able to narc you out.

50:40.660 --> 50:42.420
You're totally aces here.

50:42.420 --> 50:44.420
They're totally at the bottom of something.

50:45.060 --> 50:46.420
I ran Crabtown.

50:46.420 --> 50:48.500
I'm the mayor of Crabtown.

50:48.500 --> 50:49.300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

50:49.300 --> 50:51.380
And you know what? It was actually a chain.

50:51.380 --> 50:54.420
It was 18 stores, and I was the mayor of all of them.

50:54.980 --> 51:00.980
And I saved a small child from crabs that overran one of the stores.

51:00.980 --> 51:03.460
This is actually kind of weird because like,

51:03.460 --> 51:05.700
why doesn't everybody do this all the time?

51:05.700 --> 51:09.700
This seems like such a good crime that I'm surprised it's not extremely,

51:09.700 --> 51:10.420
extremely common.

51:10.420 --> 51:12.260
I mean, maybe it is extremely common,

51:12.260 --> 51:17.540
but it just seems like a grift everybody is probably running all the time, right?

51:17.540 --> 51:20.660
So like put down a friend's name as the phone number and say like,

51:20.660 --> 51:23.140
yeah, call the manager and ask them and then call and say like,

51:23.140 --> 51:24.100
yes, this is Todd.

51:24.100 --> 51:25.140
He was great.

51:25.140 --> 51:26.660
Hello, this is Bill Gates.

51:28.420 --> 51:32.500
Hey, was Steven really your quote number two?

51:32.500 --> 51:34.740
Was he really quote your left hand, dude?

51:35.860 --> 51:37.860
Yeah, he helped me with Microsoft 98.

51:37.860 --> 51:42.900
Steve Ballmer learned everything from him.

51:43.700 --> 51:46.100
I was going to name it 97 and he fixed it.

51:46.100 --> 51:46.900
And he fixed it.

51:46.900 --> 51:49.140
And he also made Halo, so I've got to go.

51:50.660 --> 51:53.220
It says here his job title was Keyboard Lord.

51:53.220 --> 51:55.220
Do you guys really have a job title for that?

51:56.100 --> 51:58.020
Yeah, he put the T on there.

51:58.020 --> 52:00.980
I wasn't going to include any T's and he said people might need that.

52:00.980 --> 52:03.300
It says Keyboard Lord and Mouse Master.

52:03.940 --> 52:05.220
This is a story to sound fake.

52:05.220 --> 52:07.700
Yeah, he sure is.

52:07.700 --> 52:10.500
He included the cord and buttons.

52:10.500 --> 52:12.500
I was just going to give people a hunk of plastic.

52:14.020 --> 52:16.260
I'm actually a robot that he broke in.

52:16.260 --> 52:19.140
It sounds Mr. Gates might be so bold.

52:19.140 --> 52:24.340
It sounds like really Steve was kind of the brains behind the entire operation to me.

52:25.060 --> 52:26.660
I owe him so much.

52:26.660 --> 52:26.900
Yep.

52:26.900 --> 52:27.380
What are you?

52:27.380 --> 52:29.380
I'm including my own sentence.

52:29.380 --> 52:32.340
Why do you, what are you going to do without him?

52:32.340 --> 52:33.620
Sounds like he was pretty vibe.

52:33.620 --> 52:36.980
Well, I'm making, I'm working on making new toilets now.

52:38.100 --> 52:38.900
They're pretty cool.

52:38.900 --> 52:40.100
They don't stink, these ones.

52:41.700 --> 52:42.340
It's not a joke.

52:42.340 --> 52:43.140
He's really doing that.

52:43.140 --> 52:45.860
You could also say you're Joe from Joe's Crab Shack.

52:45.860 --> 52:49.220
And you had, you were the first one who looked at these little red bastards and said,

52:49.220 --> 52:50.740
I'm eating me one of them.

52:50.740 --> 52:56.260
Yeah, Gallagher's brother started performing and doing the Sledge-O-Matic routine and a lot

52:56.260 --> 53:00.660
of Gallagher's jokes because Gallagher couldn't meet the demand of people that wanted to see

53:00.660 --> 53:01.620
Gallagher perform.

53:01.620 --> 53:06.340
So his brother started performing and then when he got in trouble with his brother for

53:06.340 --> 53:09.380
something, he started performing his Gallagher 2.

53:10.180 --> 53:14.580
And the reason I'm bringing this up is that there's probably room for a Gallagher 3 if

53:14.580 --> 53:17.380
you wanted to, or like no one would know.

53:17.380 --> 53:21.460
I think the situation's confusing enough that you could probably claim to have been Gallagher

53:21.460 --> 53:23.940
2 at a certain point or, you know.

53:25.300 --> 53:28.500
Not just, it's honestly foolproof.

53:28.500 --> 53:33.620
I guess my question is, the one question I have, how does that help you get a part-time

53:33.620 --> 53:34.260
job?

53:34.260 --> 53:36.820
Well, it's in the produce department.

53:38.260 --> 53:38.760
So.

53:39.860 --> 53:43.060
Yeah, I'm familiar with the tensile strength of a lot of people.

53:43.060 --> 53:45.620
I know exactly how hard I can punch this motherfucker.

53:46.980 --> 53:50.740
I am aware of how many bits any given produce will turn into.

53:51.620 --> 53:56.260
Apparently there is a Joe's Crab Shack in Austin, but it's quote, temporarily closed.

53:56.260 --> 53:59.620
And I don't know what conditions led it to be temporarily closed, but you may as well

53:59.620 --> 54:01.620
go ahead and make that permanent, my friend.

54:01.620 --> 54:02.740
Yeah, out of crabs.

54:04.020 --> 54:04.980
Couldn't find them.

54:04.980 --> 54:06.260
Couldn't find them anywhere.

54:06.260 --> 54:07.780
How about we close it out?

54:07.780 --> 54:08.420
I'd love that.

54:08.420 --> 54:08.900
Let's do it.

54:08.900 --> 54:10.420
Y'all, thank you so much.

54:10.420 --> 54:11.700
We've had such a good time with you.

54:11.700 --> 54:14.180
I hope you did have a happy Valentine's Day.

54:14.180 --> 54:18.900
Whatever that means for you, even if it's like not observing it at all or chilling by

54:18.900 --> 54:22.100
yourself or whatever, I hope you enjoyed yourself.

54:22.100 --> 54:26.980
Because we, kidding aside, do love you very much and we appreciate all of the support

54:26.980 --> 54:28.740
over the years, et cetera, et cetera.

54:28.740 --> 54:34.020
I want to let you know that we have tickets, hopefully on sale now if everything has gone

54:34.020 --> 54:38.260
right, for San Jose and Salt Lake City.

54:38.260 --> 54:43.460
We're going to be in San Jose April 2nd and 3rd with the Adventure Zone and my brother,

54:43.460 --> 54:44.260
my brother and me.

54:44.260 --> 54:48.260
And then we're going to be in Salt Lake City on April 4th with my brother, my brother and

54:48.260 --> 54:48.760
me.

54:48.760 --> 54:54.440
And you can get tickets for those if you go to McElroy.family and click on tours there

54:54.440 --> 54:55.160
at the beginning.

54:55.160 --> 54:59.320
And then we're going to have some more announcements coming soon for the rest of 2019.

54:59.320 --> 55:02.920
But we hope to see you all in San Jose and Salt Lake City in April.

55:04.120 --> 55:06.600
Thanks to John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song.

55:06.600 --> 55:09.000
It's a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

55:09.000 --> 55:12.840
It's a super good album that I love a lot and you will too.

55:12.840 --> 55:15.000
And thank you to Maximumfun.org for having us on the network.

55:15.000 --> 55:16.200
They got a bunch of great shows.

55:16.200 --> 55:19.000
They got a new one with Ted Leo and Amy Mann that you're going to love a lot.

55:19.000 --> 55:22.360
They've got Mission to Zix is a new one up on there.

55:22.360 --> 55:26.760
A bunch of new shows all at Maximumfun.org and we have other stuff at McElroy.family.

55:26.760 --> 55:29.640
And you know what else just occurred to me?

55:29.640 --> 55:31.880
We haven't mentioned this in a hell of a long time.

55:31.880 --> 55:36.360
We have a YouTube channel that I believe now is McElroy family is the name of the channel.

55:36.360 --> 55:40.840
You can also we have an Instagram account where you can see like some behind the scene

55:40.840 --> 55:43.480
stuff from our live shows and tours and whatnot.

55:43.480 --> 55:47.240
As well as a Twitter account at McElroy family.

55:47.240 --> 55:49.240
So like go follow those, I guess.

55:49.240 --> 55:49.960
Absolutely.

55:49.960 --> 55:50.440
Yeah.

55:51.160 --> 55:54.040
And sorry that Travis said hello.

55:54.040 --> 55:54.520
Yeah.

55:54.520 --> 55:55.960
Listen, I hate it.

55:55.960 --> 55:56.760
I hated it.

55:56.760 --> 55:58.520
As I was doing it, I hated it.

55:58.520 --> 55:59.560
So here's a final Yahoo.

55:59.560 --> 56:00.600
This one was sent in by Brian.

56:00.600 --> 56:01.080
Thank you, Brian.

56:01.080 --> 56:09.720
It's Yahoo Answers user Chris who asks, what is a ham basket and how does it get you to hell?

56:09.720 --> 56:15.080
My name is Justin McElroy.

56:15.080 --> 56:16.680
He mistook the letters.

56:16.680 --> 56:17.320
Oh, I see.

56:17.320 --> 56:18.440
I'm Travis McElroy.

56:18.440 --> 56:19.400
I'm Griffin McElroy.

56:19.400 --> 56:20.360
We were brother by brother.

56:20.360 --> 56:22.120
May I kiss your dad's square lips?

56:22.120 --> 56:41.400
Maximum fun.org.

56:41.400 --> 56:42.440
Comedy and culture.

56:42.440 --> 56:43.560
Artist owned.

56:43.560 --> 56:44.920
Listener supported.

56:44.920 --> 56:49.960
Unless you binge watch TV at least 80 hours a week, inside pop is definitely not for you.

56:49.960 --> 56:52.920
Sean, that's a little extreme and also not quite true.

56:52.920 --> 56:57.000
Okay, Amita, how about Inside Pop is the podcast for people who love and appreciate

56:57.000 --> 56:59.080
the best pop culture has to offer.

56:59.080 --> 57:00.120
Oh, much better.

57:00.120 --> 57:03.960
In every episode, we interview the people who create the culture you crave.

57:03.960 --> 57:07.720
Past interviews include the showrunner of Ava DuVernay's Queen Sugar and Mudbound

57:07.720 --> 57:09.080
director Dee Rees.

57:09.080 --> 57:13.160
You'll also get the very best pop culture recommendations in our Big Cell segment.

57:13.160 --> 57:17.400
Plus the opinions of two TV producers who are pop culture obsessives and actually do

57:17.400 --> 57:19.320
binge 80 hours of TV a week.

57:19.320 --> 57:20.440
Eyeballs.

57:20.440 --> 57:21.400
So tired.

57:21.400 --> 57:49.080
Listen to Inside Pop every other Wednesday on the Maximum Fun Podcast Network.
