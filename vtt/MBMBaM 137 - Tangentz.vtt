WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:49.280
Let's just jump right into it, guys. Dear Abby's dead, and what do we do now?

00:50.720 --> 00:57.520
Where do we go from here? There's lots of really terrible direction that we could take this goof,

00:57.520 --> 01:01.280
but I'm actually, like, super sad. I feel like a pioneer is gone.

01:02.800 --> 01:12.160
We do a super sad podcast, but a sad advice podcast is what shows up in our iTunes description.

01:12.160 --> 01:16.160
Are we to mock the passing of a titan?

01:16.160 --> 01:23.440
One of my favorite Dear Abby columns came from 1979. I thought this was the best way

01:23.440 --> 01:30.400
to remember her before we moved on to some of the actual goofs. She received a letter

01:32.720 --> 01:39.760
written by a fan of hers who was complaining about a gay couple who had moved into her

01:39.760 --> 01:45.440
neighborhood, and the letter writer said that they have all sorts of strange company.

01:46.480 --> 01:51.520
Men who look like women, women who look like men, blacks, whites, Indians.

01:51.520 --> 01:56.160
Yesterday, I even saw two nuns go in there. How can we improve the quality

01:56.160 --> 02:00.880
of this once respectable neighborhood? And her reply was, you could move.

02:04.240 --> 02:12.000
I know, like in three words, she just took somebody apart in what usually takes us

02:12.000 --> 02:15.200
15 to 20 hours to put together.

02:15.200 --> 02:19.200
That's good, man. She probably got shit like that all the time, right?

02:19.200 --> 02:20.800
Oh yeah.

02:20.800 --> 02:25.200
My black president, who I hate, is trying to take all my guns and liberties away.

02:26.240 --> 02:33.120
Why does that guy, that fella, if I may, I don't want to get too incendiary here,

02:33.120 --> 02:35.120
but why does that fellow want to take my guns?

02:35.840 --> 02:36.080
Right?

02:37.840 --> 02:47.840
Mine are first, listen, listen, listen. My AR-15 is a modern musket, and I use it for one,

02:47.840 --> 02:54.800
let's shut up. I use it for one thing, and that's sport. And the sport I like is hunting the homeless.

02:55.360 --> 03:00.000
And so Obama wants it. I'm trying, it's a modern muskem.

03:00.560 --> 03:05.440
I just want to know why does he actually want to take my real factual musket away?

03:05.440 --> 03:07.840
Why does he want to take my decorative musket?

03:08.480 --> 03:12.640
I bought this blunderbuss at an auction. It is mine, damn it.

03:12.640 --> 03:16.720
It wouldn't look as goo with a shorter capacity magazine, idiot.

03:16.720 --> 03:23.120
Right, right. Keep your hands off my novelty cannon. Leave my musket alone,

03:23.120 --> 03:29.360
and also stop trying to steal my musk. That's my fragrance. I worked on it with Jean-Pierre

03:29.360 --> 03:34.720
LaPierre, and it has sandalwood and notes of tobacco and longing, and please don't steal my

03:34.720 --> 03:36.480
musk. Please, it's my modern musk, Obama.

03:36.480 --> 03:38.720
Does Obama want to take my stank away?

03:38.720 --> 03:40.480
Why does, please don't take my modern musk, Obama.

03:40.480 --> 03:46.560
The Third Amendment defends our stank. Defends our right to hold stank without quartering

03:46.560 --> 03:49.600
enemy soldiers. I think that's number three.

03:49.600 --> 03:54.160
I've seen a lot of hostage movies, and I've learned one thing, and that's if

03:55.840 --> 04:00.720
someone is gathering up a bunch of guns, that means they're about to lead an assault.

04:00.720 --> 04:01.920
Oh my god, yeah.

04:01.920 --> 04:06.800
They're like, I need all your guns. I'm going to rescue my nephew,

04:07.680 --> 04:10.720
dumb Ricky, from the hospital that he's captive in.

04:10.720 --> 04:13.440
I got to tell you, Justin, with the flu that you have, clearly,

04:13.440 --> 04:18.320
and by the way, listeners, Justin has a flu, if you sounded just a little more belligerent,

04:18.320 --> 04:22.560
you already have this sort of death rattle voice of Alex Jones,

04:22.560 --> 04:26.720
so you could really drop some science on our listeners.

04:26.720 --> 04:29.360
Hey, listen, everybody, do you own any gold?

04:30.080 --> 04:32.320
Why not, you retards?

04:32.320 --> 04:34.320
We trade goops for gold.

04:34.320 --> 04:37.840
We trade goops for gold here on the My Brother, My Brother Me show.

04:37.840 --> 04:42.720
Hey, listen, coming up after the break, we got a brand new set of knives.

04:42.720 --> 04:44.000
These are pearl-handled.

04:44.800 --> 04:48.320
You're going to be able to pick up three of these for $17.99,

04:48.320 --> 04:51.440
and after the break, a samurai sword also.

04:51.440 --> 04:53.520
It's going to look real great on your mantle,

04:53.520 --> 04:57.040
or your modern musket used to hang before Obama took it away.

04:57.040 --> 05:00.000
Now, let me ask, is Alex Jones also like a CBS-

05:00.000 --> 05:01.840
Alex Jones hosts the Knife Show.

05:01.840 --> 05:02.080
Okay.

05:02.800 --> 05:05.360
Yeah, Alex Jones hosts the Knife Show.

05:05.360 --> 05:10.800
I realized as I was doing that goof that I really don't know anything about Alex Jones,

05:10.800 --> 05:14.320
except he thinks everybody should have a water purifier in their apartment,

05:14.320 --> 05:17.520
and then I decided to transition seamlessly,

05:17.520 --> 05:19.680
at least it was seamless until you pointed it out,

05:19.680 --> 05:23.840
seamlessly into the guy that runs the Knife Show, which I love.

05:23.840 --> 05:24.640
I love that guy.

05:24.640 --> 05:25.040
Okay.

05:25.040 --> 05:28.960
You're going to be able to buy 70 knives for $30.

05:31.040 --> 05:32.320
What is the situation?

05:32.320 --> 05:35.520
That is a lot of knives for a very low amount of money.

05:35.520 --> 05:38.480
I want to practice throwing knives into the river.

05:38.480 --> 05:40.880
But I don't want to walk over and retrieve them.

05:40.880 --> 05:42.720
Now, see, my joke was the river.

05:42.720 --> 05:44.480
You should have let me finish my joke.

05:44.480 --> 05:45.280
I think you were crossing-

05:45.280 --> 05:46.240
Let me try again.

05:46.240 --> 05:46.880
Ah, Jesus.

05:46.880 --> 05:51.040
I'm going to throw my knives, and I want to practice throwing knives into the river.

05:52.240 --> 05:55.520
This episode of My Brother, My Brother, Me is sponsored by Theraflu,

05:55.520 --> 06:01.600
which if you take too much of it, you are just going to fucking trip your ass right to the moon.

06:02.720 --> 06:05.200
I live in a van down by the river.

06:05.200 --> 06:06.160
You guys hear that one?

06:06.160 --> 06:08.400
Great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great.

06:08.400 --> 06:13.920
A van down by the river, Mount Folly.

06:13.920 --> 06:15.040
Travis, do you think we should-

06:17.040 --> 06:18.000
Should we start...

06:18.960 --> 06:23.760
A, should we take control of the podcast, and B, should we host some sort of intervention?

06:23.760 --> 06:27.120
I would take control of the podcast, Griffin, but Obama took my guns away.

06:30.320 --> 06:32.800
You want control of this podcast, you're going to take it by force.

06:33.520 --> 06:36.720
You can pry this podcast out of my cold, dead fingers.

06:36.720 --> 06:38.240
Uh, here's a question.

06:39.120 --> 06:41.040
I have a first date coming up.

06:41.040 --> 06:44.080
I recently found out, however, that the girl I'm going out with

06:44.080 --> 06:47.440
has a Twitter account where she live tweets all her first dates.

06:47.440 --> 06:50.400
Oh, what the fuck?

06:50.400 --> 06:53.680
I haven't followed her, and my account isn't public,

06:53.680 --> 07:00.400
but I do have the address and all signs point to her not knowing slash not caring that I can read it.

07:00.400 --> 07:02.560
She's tweeted some about me already.

07:02.560 --> 07:04.800
We're going to dinner and a concert.

07:04.800 --> 07:08.720
Should I discreetly follow the play by play and act accordingly,

07:08.720 --> 07:11.760
or should I ignore it in hopes that I won't throw off my game?

07:11.760 --> 07:13.040
That's tempted by Twitter.

07:14.240 --> 07:15.680
Are you kidding me?

07:15.680 --> 07:18.720
The fucking worst thing I've ever heard.

07:18.720 --> 07:19.760
What are we doing?

07:20.960 --> 07:24.960
So is this like she just does it, or like she's doing it as like a project?

07:25.600 --> 07:29.120
It sounds like, it sounds like this is her social media presence.

07:30.080 --> 07:31.120
Yeah, it's awful.

07:31.760 --> 07:33.440
You're the worst person.

07:33.440 --> 07:38.000
But no, the worst person is the person who didn't include her username so I can follow her.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.320
Yeah, that's that's a great point.

07:40.320 --> 07:42.240
I mean, I would I would do that.

07:42.240 --> 07:43.280
Don't get me wrong.

07:43.280 --> 07:45.200
I would do this for entertainment, but it's like,

07:45.840 --> 07:51.840
this is the same reason that you don't date a dark a Kardashian is because you don't want the

07:51.840 --> 07:53.440
you don't want that to be your whole life.

07:53.440 --> 07:55.200
You know, exactly right.

07:56.480 --> 07:59.360
People forget how good you are at football or rapping.

07:59.360 --> 08:02.000
That's the only thing that's keeping me from doing that.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.480
Other than the fact that I'm very happily engaged.

08:04.480 --> 08:09.360
And also I still don't know what and who the fuck those people are and what they did.

08:10.480 --> 08:14.320
I would also like to point out I mean, I know that this wasn't the point of the question.

08:14.320 --> 08:17.280
But this means that when this girl goes on a first date,

08:17.280 --> 08:19.840
she's constantly like typing on her phone.

08:19.840 --> 08:21.680
Maybe she goes on a lot of first dates.

08:22.320 --> 08:25.760
At least you'd know like right when you like like like you

08:26.320 --> 08:27.440
I'll order for the lady.

08:27.440 --> 08:30.320
Oh, oh, oh, oh, coming out.

08:30.320 --> 08:34.240
You accidentally like flip around and kind of mustard on to her and she

08:34.240 --> 08:34.960
whips the phone out.

08:34.960 --> 08:37.760
You're like, okay, I did deserve that one.

08:37.760 --> 08:38.320
You got me.

08:39.520 --> 08:41.600
Can you just be like having dinner with her and be like,

08:41.600 --> 08:46.080
Hey, would you mind putting your goddamned phone away?

08:46.080 --> 08:50.640
So I can like try and form a personal connection with you and maybe later get some touch

08:51.200 --> 08:54.640
here in the wilderness of human civilization.

08:54.640 --> 08:58.640
Two people have found each other and you're marking the occasion by like

08:58.640 --> 09:00.800
play by playing it tweet by tweet.

09:00.800 --> 09:06.480
I also would suggest like, listen, I'm not one to to to poo poo something before

09:06.480 --> 09:07.680
you even give it a shot.

09:07.680 --> 09:09.120
But this girl sounds awful.

09:10.400 --> 09:11.040
Is that just me?

09:11.040 --> 09:13.840
She doesn't sound like very, very cool or fun.

09:14.560 --> 09:16.000
I mean, it could be cool and fun.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.240
We don't know unless we read those those tweets.

09:18.240 --> 09:20.240
Is it possible that she's dating you?

09:20.240 --> 09:26.960
Is it possible that she's dating you because like a one girl in the in that boy meets world

09:26.960 --> 09:35.920
episode, Topanga, no, Cory's mom, no, the Alanis, Cory's dad, Morgan, Morgan one, Morgan

09:35.920 --> 09:41.280
two, the one who had a songwriting career about Cory's brother, Larissa Olenek.

09:42.400 --> 09:43.200
Okay, right.

09:43.760 --> 09:45.360
And she needed to date him again.

09:45.360 --> 09:52.480
I feel like you guys are kind of I'm trying to get a black one, you know, the only one

09:52.480 --> 09:55.040
there weren't the one black person on Boy Meets World.

09:55.040 --> 09:57.520
No, to be fair, there were two.

09:58.480 --> 10:00.160
There were two black people.

10:00.160 --> 10:02.960
There was the teacher in season one who was not asked back.

10:02.960 --> 10:03.440
Oh, shit.

10:05.280 --> 10:07.040
Anyway, what were you saying, Justin?

10:07.040 --> 10:11.520
There was one on there that dated Cory's brother.

10:11.520 --> 10:15.120
Uh, and he treated her badly and she got a hit song out of it.

10:15.920 --> 10:16.640
Okay, I give up.

10:16.640 --> 10:17.200
Potato.

10:17.200 --> 10:17.760
I quit.

10:17.760 --> 10:18.240
I'm out.

10:19.040 --> 10:19.520
I'm out.

10:19.520 --> 10:20.240
I quit.

10:20.240 --> 10:20.960
Was it potato?

10:20.960 --> 10:21.760
I think she's dead.

10:21.760 --> 10:23.600
I think she's going out with you for more material.

10:23.600 --> 10:24.800
That's what I'm saying to you.

10:24.800 --> 10:30.240
This is what I'm dating you for material as somebody who works on and broadcasts pretty

10:30.240 --> 10:34.240
much exclusively on the Internet for the way that they make money for a living.

10:34.240 --> 10:40.320
Why does this person feel like the medium for this broadcast has to be live?

10:40.320 --> 10:44.400
Is their audience like, it's eight o'clock on Friday, time to tune into those tweets?

10:44.400 --> 10:46.160
It's not like an old-timey radio show.

10:46.160 --> 10:49.920
Why can't she fucking wait home and then write up a blog post and try and make an honest?

10:49.920 --> 10:51.680
Who remembers anything, though?

10:51.680 --> 10:53.760
I don't remember anything that happens unless I tweet it.

10:53.760 --> 10:58.320
And also, can you imagine being the dude who reads the field report later, where it's like,

10:58.320 --> 11:00.080
so here's how it went down.

11:00.080 --> 11:02.560
And you're like, oh, man, I thought I did good.

11:02.560 --> 11:03.600
I did bad.

11:03.600 --> 11:05.440
I thought I did a real good job.

11:05.440 --> 11:10.560
I thought I did a real good job. Best way to build your presence is probably to bomb the

11:10.560 --> 11:13.920
date, because then you're going to get a lot of people following you.

11:13.920 --> 11:21.120
If your date's good or unremarkable, it's going to be a non-starter.

11:21.120 --> 11:23.840
But like, if you completely bomb it.

11:23.840 --> 11:27.440
Just compulsive, memetic behavior.

11:27.440 --> 11:38.320
Yeah, unless you have the greatest date anyone has ever had ever.

11:38.320 --> 11:42.080
Now, listen, you're really going to have to pull out all the stops and really commit to this.

11:43.280 --> 11:48.560
But you could be Twitter famous for having the best date ever.

11:48.560 --> 11:54.240
Everybody has been trying to have the best date ever for a thousand years.

11:54.240 --> 11:57.360
Listen, I'm not saying the mods aren't stacked against him.

11:57.360 --> 12:00.320
I'm not saying it's not going to be an uphill climb.

12:00.320 --> 12:06.480
He'll show up to the dinner with like a ukulele and he's like, that's for later.

12:06.480 --> 12:12.480
He'll have two jackets so he can put one around you and also one over that puddle that you can step over.

12:13.200 --> 12:17.840
The greatest first date ever was already had by John Cusack, Kate Beckinsale and Serendipity.

12:19.600 --> 12:20.640
Let that ship sail.

12:20.640 --> 12:21.600
You're not going to beat him.

12:21.600 --> 12:25.040
Or recreate Serendipity, but don't tell her what you're doing.

12:25.040 --> 12:30.880
Isn't that sort of against the spirit of the film Serendipity?

12:32.160 --> 12:38.080
What if she hasn't seen Serendipity and her followers realize before she does

12:38.080 --> 12:40.800
that he is just recreating the film Serendipity?

12:40.800 --> 12:45.200
Holy shit, you have to secretly be tweeting about the date also

12:45.200 --> 12:49.280
that you are goofing her on on a faux Serendipity switcheroo.

12:49.280 --> 12:57.440
Oh my god, that, I mean that's a little played out.

12:57.440 --> 12:58.000
Yeah.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.440
I got another question for you.

12:59.440 --> 12:59.840
Okay.

12:59.840 --> 13:01.040
I have a problem.

13:01.040 --> 13:04.320
My boss is super long-winded and he's super on my case.

13:04.320 --> 13:09.520
Some of his points are valid, but it's as if he will not stop speaking on his own volition.

13:09.520 --> 13:14.160
He'll circle the same point over and over again, repeating things he said in past conversations

13:14.160 --> 13:15.280
or just minutes ago.

13:15.280 --> 13:18.640
I don't think I've ever had a one-on-one with him that was under 20 minutes.

13:18.640 --> 13:20.400
They're usually closer to 40.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.880
There's never more than five minutes worth of information.

13:22.880 --> 13:26.880
He is my boss and I can't tell him to shut his goddamn yapper.

13:27.520 --> 13:28.640
Need some tips and tricks.

13:28.640 --> 13:31.680
That's from Karma Tornado.

13:31.680 --> 13:35.200
I have never understood when people have this complaint.

13:35.200 --> 13:40.080
It's like they don't realize that in the 40 minutes where your boss is telling you

13:40.080 --> 13:43.360
things to do, you're not having to do anything.

13:43.360 --> 13:44.080
That's a 40 minute.

13:44.080 --> 13:46.800
You're trying to remember the lyrics to a Dave Matthews Band song.

13:46.800 --> 13:47.680
That's right.

13:47.680 --> 13:50.320
You don't have to work when your boss is talking to you.

13:50.320 --> 13:52.080
It's like a little vacation in the middle of the day.

13:52.080 --> 13:52.580
Yeah.

13:53.040 --> 13:58.880
We used to try to get my friggin' algebra teacher to tell us about the Civil War.

13:58.880 --> 13:59.360
Oh, man.

13:59.360 --> 14:03.360
Because if you could get him to talk about that, Mr. Sheets would go on a whole class

14:03.360 --> 14:04.720
period on that topic.

14:04.720 --> 14:06.640
I would also suggest this phrase.

14:06.640 --> 14:07.840
I'm going to stop you right there.

14:08.640 --> 14:10.160
You've inspired me.

14:10.160 --> 14:10.660
Okay.

14:11.680 --> 14:17.040
I'd just be like, I have to finish this project now, Frank.

14:17.040 --> 14:17.280
Thank you.

14:17.280 --> 14:21.680
Listen, Frank, you've put the wind, the proverbial wind, beneath my wings.

14:21.680 --> 14:23.120
I really need to fly now.

14:23.120 --> 14:25.040
I feel like I need to fly on my own.

14:25.600 --> 14:26.800
Can you give me a coffee?

14:28.800 --> 14:29.600
Are you my boss?

14:29.600 --> 14:31.040
Because Justin forgot the question.

14:32.720 --> 14:35.280
Listen, Frank, this back's not going to rub itself.

14:36.000 --> 14:39.360
Listen, Frank, please just drive the cab, Frank.

14:39.360 --> 14:40.800
Man, I really, I'm lost.

14:40.800 --> 14:46.080
What are you, are you, did you take like cold medicine or dilaudid?

14:46.080 --> 14:46.720
What are you on?

14:46.720 --> 14:48.160
I took, here's what I'm on.

14:48.160 --> 14:55.440
I'm on Tamiflu, which I heard some hubbub about back when the superflu was like a real fear.

14:55.440 --> 14:56.560
So I'm on Tamiflu.

14:57.200 --> 14:59.200
I'm on dextromethorphan.

14:59.200 --> 15:00.320
That's not, you just, what?

15:00.320 --> 15:02.240
That's going to decongest me.

15:02.240 --> 15:06.240
I'm on, Mucinex DM has that in it.

15:06.240 --> 15:10.240
And it's got a cough suppressant and something to just loosen it up.

15:10.240 --> 15:16.560
And then I'm on some ibuprofen and some zinc, which for me, when I have a hard hit of zinc,

15:16.560 --> 15:21.840
it's like, it feels like my brain is a balloon and I have to pull its string down to earth

15:21.840 --> 15:24.400
to grab the balloon and whisper in its ear.

15:24.400 --> 15:26.800
I actually know that to be a fact.

15:26.800 --> 15:30.080
That is not a goof that Justin is coming up with right now.

15:30.080 --> 15:32.800
I remember that being a problem Justin had in high school.

15:32.800 --> 15:34.320
The zinc gets you fucked up?

15:34.320 --> 15:36.480
Zinc gets me messed up.

15:36.480 --> 15:38.080
I'd really lose it on zinc.

15:38.080 --> 15:40.000
I lose, I lose whole seconds.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.040
I fall out of time.

15:41.920 --> 15:45.680
But this is like, why would you take it before we do the show instead of just playing through

15:45.680 --> 15:47.840
the pain like fucking Curt Schilling in the bloody sock?

15:48.560 --> 15:50.560
This could have been your bloody sock of comedy.

15:50.560 --> 15:51.680
But this is weird.

15:51.680 --> 15:54.560
I've also drank a lot of beers before this too, so I mean.

15:54.560 --> 15:59.520
Am I the only one that is substantly, I'm actually, I'm sorry, I'm on crack,

15:59.520 --> 16:00.720
I'm on crack cocaine right now.

16:01.360 --> 16:02.640
You smoked crack?

16:02.640 --> 16:03.760
Crack cocaine.

16:03.760 --> 16:05.520
Hey, can you give us a Yahoo answer?

16:05.520 --> 16:06.320
Sure, I can.

16:06.320 --> 16:11.760
This Yahoo answer was sent in by Matt R. Thank you, Matt R. It's by Yahoo answers user.

16:11.760 --> 16:13.840
Is it any relation to Chris R?

16:13.840 --> 16:16.400
Yes, it's Chris R's little brother.

16:17.200 --> 16:21.360
Thank you, Matt R. It's by Yahoo answers user.

16:22.640 --> 16:24.560
Rose is a vander.

16:26.160 --> 16:30.480
Who asks, is it wrong that I sleep with a machete?

16:32.320 --> 16:37.040
I sleep with a machete every night in case I wake up in the morning and I'm forced to survive.

16:37.040 --> 16:41.200
I keep two lighters with me unless I'm at school and occasionally carry a dagger in my boot.

16:41.200 --> 16:43.760
My mom is threatening to take away all my stuff

16:43.760 --> 16:47.200
because having the weapons only feeds my fear or government.

16:47.200 --> 16:49.520
That's probably fear of government.

16:49.520 --> 16:51.760
But when I have my machete, I'm not afraid of anything.

16:51.760 --> 16:54.080
She just can't see that something is going on in the world.

16:54.080 --> 16:57.920
She doesn't understand that I don't feel like I'm here to have kids and start a family.

16:57.920 --> 17:01.120
I feel like I'm here to fight and die for my loved ones.

17:01.120 --> 17:04.240
I just don't see how it's wrong to be ready for a disaster.

17:04.240 --> 17:08.320
I don't want to wake up and have the house falling apart and I die trying to get my stuff together.

17:08.320 --> 17:14.160
Is he saying literally, like is he going to fight an earthquake with his magic machete?

17:14.160 --> 17:19.840
Can I hit you guys with a proverb and you let me know if it seems wise to you?

17:19.840 --> 17:21.920
Because in my head right now it seems really wise.

17:21.920 --> 17:24.480
Throw your wisdom spaghetti against our wall and we'll tell you what's next.

17:24.480 --> 17:25.440
Let me just see what it says.

17:25.440 --> 17:28.080
And then we'll say, you wasted that spaghetti, what the fuck?

17:28.080 --> 17:30.720
I'm not saying you're going to want to like cross stitch this on something,

17:30.720 --> 17:33.120
but I think there's a nugget of truth there.

17:33.120 --> 17:38.960
The man who sleeps with a machete is a fool every night, but one.

17:40.640 --> 17:42.000
Think about that for a second.

17:42.000 --> 17:42.480
You know what?

17:42.480 --> 17:44.560
I am going to get that stitched onto a pillow.

17:45.200 --> 17:46.720
Or your arm or something.

17:46.720 --> 17:48.160
Just like stitch it, I feel like.

17:48.160 --> 17:51.360
I also, I don't want to get too deep here,

17:51.360 --> 17:55.520
but I would also say that every morning when you wake up, you're forced to survive.

17:57.120 --> 17:58.000
Damn it.

17:58.000 --> 17:58.480
Can I try?

17:59.040 --> 17:59.520
Can I try?

17:59.520 --> 18:00.800
Yeah, yeah.

18:00.800 --> 18:05.360
The world is a little bit brighter when you carry a smile for a flashlight.

18:05.360 --> 18:06.160
God damn it.

18:06.720 --> 18:07.360
Can I try again?

18:07.360 --> 18:10.400
Let me hit you with another one.

18:10.400 --> 18:10.640
Okay.

18:11.280 --> 18:12.080
Okay.

18:12.080 --> 18:14.640
Life is like a box of chalk.

18:14.640 --> 18:16.560
Get out, we were doing so good.

18:17.120 --> 18:18.720
We were doing so good.

18:19.520 --> 18:20.080
Oh wait, okay.

18:20.080 --> 18:20.960
How about this one?

18:20.960 --> 18:21.440
Okay.

18:21.440 --> 18:24.720
The man who sleeps with a machete is a cut above the rest.

18:26.720 --> 18:28.800
That wasn't a proverb, it was just like a pun.

18:28.800 --> 18:29.440
I think it was.

18:29.440 --> 18:30.800
I think it was.

18:30.800 --> 18:35.280
That sounds like the sign you put outside of your machete store.

18:37.440 --> 18:41.680
Well, okay, to be fair, my machete store, a cut above, is thriving.

18:41.680 --> 18:42.480
Thank you very much.

18:44.320 --> 18:45.200
Can I try?

18:45.200 --> 18:46.240
Yeah, you want to try again?

18:47.360 --> 18:51.520
There are holes in the floor of heaven and mama's tears are raining down.

18:52.720 --> 18:53.440
What?

18:53.440 --> 18:56.080
That's from the country song, Holes in the Floor of Heaven.

18:56.080 --> 18:56.720
All right.

18:56.720 --> 18:57.600
Feed Jake.

18:57.600 --> 18:59.440
He's been a good dog.

18:59.440 --> 19:01.920
Been my friend right through it all.

19:01.920 --> 19:03.200
Don't take the girl.

19:04.160 --> 19:08.720
Mama, God please, don't take the girl.

19:08.720 --> 19:11.120
Can we just do Tim McGraw songs for this?

19:11.120 --> 19:14.080
Listen, hey pretty lady, won't you give me a sign?

19:14.080 --> 19:16.640
That's John Michael Montgomery.

19:17.280 --> 19:19.760
I don't mean to put you on blast, but it's John Michael Montgomery.

19:22.560 --> 19:26.160
Guys, listen, prop me up beside the jukebox if I die.

19:26.160 --> 19:26.720
Okay.

19:26.720 --> 19:27.040
You know?

19:27.040 --> 19:27.540
Water.

19:28.560 --> 19:30.000
If you guys want to pursue this.

19:30.640 --> 19:33.200
Let's all go down to the Dumas Walkers.

19:34.640 --> 19:39.200
Trump's going to be able to procure a slaw dog, fries, and a bottle of ski.

19:39.200 --> 19:42.400
And then you can bring it on out to your baby and ye.

19:45.360 --> 19:47.360
Three people just lost their shit.

19:47.360 --> 19:49.760
Yeah, and all of them are in the Kentucky Head Hunters.

19:50.720 --> 19:52.880
Okay, I'm so flattered.

19:52.880 --> 19:54.880
So flattered you guys are listening, by the way.

19:54.880 --> 19:56.080
Okay.

19:56.080 --> 19:58.240
I have friends in Austin.

19:58.880 --> 20:04.880
I went on a fucking doomsday preppers bender over the holidays.

20:04.880 --> 20:07.200
And when I got back to Austin, I was hanging out with my group of friends.

20:07.760 --> 20:10.000
Yeah, and there's this show, Doomsday Preppers.

20:10.000 --> 20:15.600
They build secret lairs and they buy a bunch of shit and prep for the end of the world.

20:15.600 --> 20:16.640
Isn't that crazy?

20:16.640 --> 20:21.040
And pretty much all of them either, the two responses I got were, we have that, yes.

20:21.040 --> 20:25.680
Or we are in actively in the process of acquiring those things.

20:26.480 --> 20:30.480
So you think that like everybody is secretly doomsday prepping?

20:31.120 --> 20:35.200
I feel like I'm the only person who like when shit goes rough,

20:35.200 --> 20:38.560
when shit starts to pop off, Quetzalcoatl makes his tardy appearance.

20:39.280 --> 20:42.800
Like everybody on my street is just going to like iron shutters are going to slam over

20:42.800 --> 20:45.280
their door and be like, where's our fucking iron shutters?

20:45.280 --> 20:46.320
Why didn't we get those?

20:46.320 --> 20:49.840
I went to New Year's Eve.

20:49.840 --> 20:53.680
I went to dinner at like a fancy, very fancy restaurant.

20:53.680 --> 20:56.400
And they did this thing where after we ate,

20:59.360 --> 21:06.960
they took a razor or like a long, thin metal blade and scraped it over our table.

21:06.960 --> 21:13.760
So we would not have to, our vision would not be besmirched by crumbs anymore.

21:13.760 --> 21:19.920
Or I say that because if that's still going on in society,

21:19.920 --> 21:26.480
like I think we have a pretty long way to fall before we're back to like machetes.

21:26.480 --> 21:30.320
Like if that's the first thing that goes and then it's like,

21:30.320 --> 21:33.360
I have to reach the adjacent table to get a bottle of ketchup.

21:33.360 --> 21:35.520
Like that's our apocalypse.

21:35.520 --> 21:40.160
Like I don't think we have so far to break down before that.

21:40.160 --> 21:42.000
Like I think I'll see it coming.

21:42.000 --> 21:45.200
Justin, the point you're trying to make right now seems so innocuous.

21:45.200 --> 21:49.360
But what you're really saying is that you have become accustomed to a level of comfort

21:49.920 --> 21:56.480
where if you don't have a man who scrapes the crumbs off of your table,

21:56.480 --> 22:00.880
so you don't have to look at the crumbs from the expensive, delicious food you just ate,

22:00.880 --> 22:03.040
you might as well be fucking dead.

22:03.040 --> 22:06.720
You might as well just like, you might as well just lay down and wait to die.

22:06.720 --> 22:08.880
That's not the exact point I was trying to make.

22:08.880 --> 22:10.800
But I mean, I think that that's fine.

22:10.800 --> 22:15.600
If you, I would prefer someone next time scrape the crumbs off myself

22:15.600 --> 22:20.080
because then it's like there's a clean table and a crummy guy.

22:20.080 --> 22:21.840
And it's like, how did that happen?

22:21.840 --> 22:22.880
I don't have a good excuse.

22:22.880 --> 22:24.720
But did you come into this restaurant with crumbs?

22:24.720 --> 22:26.800
You gotta use a soft bristled broom.

22:26.800 --> 22:28.640
Sir, please don't touch the table.

22:28.640 --> 22:29.040
Please.

22:29.760 --> 22:32.880
Please sir, we have another party coming in in a couple hours.

22:34.160 --> 22:37.040
Can we get a giraffe in here to lick these crumbs off of him?

22:37.040 --> 22:37.600
Thank you.

22:37.600 --> 22:38.880
We have a self mess.

22:38.880 --> 22:44.640
Can someone please open up the guest gutter and dump him in, please?

22:46.400 --> 22:48.960
Someone with a BMI over 10 is in the restaurant.

22:49.520 --> 22:52.080
Can we have them removed, please?

22:52.080 --> 22:53.840
I really am, like, I feel like-

22:53.840 --> 22:58.160
They're ensloppining the whole, the whole atmosphere.

22:59.520 --> 23:02.880
A machete seems just like an, like an awfully dangerous thing to sleep with.

23:03.760 --> 23:05.360
How, why is it so much, okay.

23:05.360 --> 23:10.880
Okay, why is it, you know what, I have an axe within reach of the bed,

23:10.880 --> 23:15.120
but it's not in the bed unless you count, I mean, unless you count the battle axe.

23:15.120 --> 23:19.520
Well, in his defense, in his defense, your axe doesn't have a vagina on it.

23:20.240 --> 23:21.200
Right, correct.

23:21.200 --> 23:24.320
Sorry, let me be, I didn't read that paragraph of the Yahoo answer,

23:24.320 --> 23:26.720
but his machete has a fake vagina on it.

23:26.720 --> 23:29.680
We've been doing this show for too long officially, I think.

23:30.720 --> 23:34.640
Can we do a show about normal people, normal things that they do?

23:34.640 --> 23:37.840
I would say, Griffin, I would say that it is okay to throw stones at people

23:37.840 --> 23:39.920
who have sexual relationships with weaponry.

23:39.920 --> 23:42.160
Well, it's not safe, certainly.

23:42.880 --> 23:46.240
I'd throw stones at other people before I'd throw stones at people

23:46.240 --> 23:47.920
who are in love with an axe, certainly.

23:47.920 --> 23:51.760
Wait a second, do you think that's the, oh my God,

23:52.320 --> 23:58.880
all of like the crazy, like crazy NRA gun appreciation day,

23:59.600 --> 24:03.040
do you think it's really because they are fucking these guns literally?

24:03.040 --> 24:06.240
They are put, if you push two pistol barrels together,

24:06.240 --> 24:09.680
man, and just wedge something in there, it's gonna feel phenomenal.

24:10.800 --> 24:12.080
You listen to me, Bula.

24:12.080 --> 24:12.880
Oh, man.

24:12.880 --> 24:14.800
I will never let them take you.

24:15.360 --> 24:18.720
You are my special, special somebody.

24:21.200 --> 24:23.680
I can't tell if you're trying to do Alex Jones, but.

24:23.680 --> 24:27.440
I don't know who that is, I don't know what he sounds like breathing.

24:27.440 --> 24:30.400
I know he's a nut bar and I know he thinks he was a hoax.

24:30.400 --> 24:33.600
You listen to me, Bula, I'm gonna have sex with your barrel

24:33.600 --> 24:38.080
while I tell you that the second tower could never have come down

24:38.080 --> 24:39.760
because metal doesn't melt that way.

24:41.280 --> 24:44.560
I'm gonna cock my gun and then I'm gonna pull back the hammer thing

24:44.560 --> 24:45.600
that gets it ready to shoot.

24:49.600 --> 24:54.160
I have a friend that I will hang out with a lot and we have a lot of fun.

24:54.160 --> 24:55.680
Do you want me to do this for you?

24:55.680 --> 24:57.520
Let me try it in a different tense.

24:57.520 --> 25:00.720
Because this seemed very sort of forward-looking.

25:00.720 --> 25:05.280
That was past perfect participle present perfunctory.

25:05.280 --> 25:10.960
I have a friend that I hang out with a lot and we have a lot of fun when we go out.

25:10.960 --> 25:14.400
The problem is whenever I say something funny or come up with a goof,

25:14.400 --> 25:17.360
he will repeat what I just said back to me verbatim.

25:17.360 --> 25:22.160
Not only that, he won't add anything to the joke and he will repeat what I said

25:22.160 --> 25:24.560
to other friends and take full credit for it.

25:24.560 --> 25:26.320
Is it awkward or is it funny?

25:26.320 --> 25:30.560
Is it awkward because I don't want to call him out for it,

25:30.560 --> 25:32.560
but sometimes it gets a little annoying.

25:32.560 --> 25:36.080
Should I tell him to write his own jokes or should I just suck it up?

25:36.080 --> 25:37.760
It's from Shafted and Savannah.

25:38.400 --> 25:42.480
Is he like saying, hey guys, did you hear what he just said?

25:42.480 --> 25:46.880
He said and then repeating the joke or literally just turning to the group

25:46.880 --> 25:48.480
and saying it again.

25:48.480 --> 25:52.400
It sounds like he's just literally saying them right like he's mirroring them.

25:52.400 --> 25:55.680
But he's learning.

25:55.680 --> 26:00.320
When he first started hanging out with us, he was an amorphous blob,

26:00.320 --> 26:03.680
but he's starting to gain characteristics similar to my own.

26:04.960 --> 26:05.760
I don't know, man.

26:05.760 --> 26:11.760
I think if you call this dude out, he's going to give you an invasion of the body snatchers

26:11.760 --> 26:17.280
style owl and then I think he's going to turn to Ash and return to his home planet.

26:17.280 --> 26:24.640
He'll have surpassed you and he'll take your words, your thoughts.

26:24.640 --> 26:25.520
He'll steal them.

26:27.200 --> 26:29.520
Does this man have a slug attached to his brain?

26:29.520 --> 26:31.360
Is there a slug, a visible slug?

26:31.360 --> 26:34.080
Is there a visible slug coming through like a part in his hair?

26:35.040 --> 26:36.320
Does he have any spines?

26:37.120 --> 26:38.720
Can anyone else see him but you?

26:41.040 --> 26:42.720
Are you imaginary perhaps?

26:42.720 --> 26:47.200
Does he ask to borrow some of your clothes and then all of your clothes?

26:47.200 --> 26:49.680
Are you two ever in the same room at the same time?

26:49.680 --> 26:52.320
Does your mother often confuse him for you?

26:52.320 --> 26:54.000
How did you internet, Fignant?

26:57.360 --> 26:58.240
That's amazing.

26:58.800 --> 27:00.080
That's amazing, Fignant.

27:01.280 --> 27:02.800
Fig Newton, you're incredible.

27:04.080 --> 27:05.840
Juice Newton, you're a great singer.

27:05.840 --> 27:12.560
That's a personal message from me to Juice Newton.

27:12.560 --> 27:13.680
Oh, God.

27:13.680 --> 27:15.920
The title of this episode is Tangents with a Z.

27:22.480 --> 27:23.520
Did you guys have a good week?

27:27.360 --> 27:29.360
Let's just, let's pause.

27:29.360 --> 27:30.000
Take a break.

27:30.000 --> 27:31.360
Take a brother break.

27:31.360 --> 27:32.560
Just a quick brother break.

27:32.560 --> 27:33.680
We don't want to take these anymore.

27:33.680 --> 27:35.920
So Justin could huff some more zinc.

27:35.920 --> 27:39.440
I'm just trying to get it together on home on my friend.

27:39.440 --> 27:41.600
Let's, I think we should go to the money zone.

27:41.600 --> 27:45.120
Yeah, this is so far has been something that we should be paid for.

27:45.760 --> 27:48.080
I look back at the past half hour and think,

27:48.080 --> 27:53.120
I just, I demand recompense for this has happened.

27:54.080 --> 27:56.320
And I bet you and I were thinking the same thing.

27:56.320 --> 27:57.360
These guys are great.

27:57.360 --> 27:59.920
I just wish I could pay for what's happening to me.

27:59.920 --> 28:04.160
Don't put a penny into the port at the bottom of your iPod because it'll break.

28:04.880 --> 28:05.360
Yeah.

28:05.360 --> 28:07.040
And also don't want more than pennies.

28:07.680 --> 28:08.960
Yeah, I need dollars.

28:08.960 --> 28:09.840
Dollars and cents.

28:09.840 --> 28:10.640
That's all we're about.

28:10.640 --> 28:12.080
No, not cents.

28:12.080 --> 28:16.080
I want, and no, cents like musk because Obama stole all mine.

28:16.080 --> 28:20.720
So if someone can steal me, send me a musk that I can use for my variance.

28:20.720 --> 28:22.800
Have you ever thought about how musk sounds like musket?

28:24.640 --> 28:28.480
And how musket sounds like musketoon, which is like a shorter barreled musket.

28:28.480 --> 28:32.400
I got a pretty good goof coming up for you 20 minutes ago, Griffin.

28:32.400 --> 28:34.080
I think you're really going to have liked it.

28:38.080 --> 28:40.640
Most people aren't aware that this podcast is cyclical.

28:42.480 --> 28:44.240
Yeah, this whole podcast is a haiku.

28:48.800 --> 28:51.360
Actually, the last podcast will end with our birth.

28:52.320 --> 28:53.440
It'll be really weird.

28:53.440 --> 28:55.760
Like a snake eating its own tail.

28:55.760 --> 28:57.280
My brother, my brother and me.

28:57.280 --> 29:00.000
It's going to be Mobius strip.

29:00.000 --> 29:01.840
Nope, wait, money zone.

29:12.080 --> 29:15.200
Happy birthday and anniversary.

29:15.200 --> 29:21.520
I hope we were paid twice for this message to Arthur Gorka and that's happy anniversary

29:21.520 --> 29:22.560
of your birth.

29:22.560 --> 29:28.880
Happy anniversary of your birth and your agreement to stay with each other forever.

29:28.880 --> 29:30.960
That's from Lindsay Wood.

29:32.400 --> 29:34.880
She loves Arthur very much, one would assume.

29:34.880 --> 29:42.800
And it's his birthday and the day that their special commitment was born.

29:42.800 --> 29:43.200
So we have-

29:43.200 --> 29:44.400
What is that, you ask?

29:44.400 --> 29:44.960
We don't know.

29:45.840 --> 29:46.160
Love?

29:46.720 --> 29:47.280
Love?

29:47.280 --> 29:48.080
What am love?

29:48.080 --> 29:50.080
Am just in love?

29:55.600 --> 29:57.120
Am just in no love, yes.

30:04.400 --> 30:05.760
Am just in touch love?

30:15.680 --> 30:17.040
Oh my God.

30:17.040 --> 30:22.560
I promise we didn't, during the money zone break, we didn't take chunky bong rips.

30:28.240 --> 30:30.320
We did all take a fuckload of Zinco.

30:32.240 --> 30:34.560
Griffin, who am feeling?

30:36.640 --> 30:38.480
Justin, can you guide us through these choppy waters?

30:39.200 --> 30:39.440
Yeah.

30:41.280 --> 30:42.960
Why is Justin at the wheel?

30:42.960 --> 30:53.840
Oh man, I watched Blue Velvet last night and at the moment where Dennis Hopper is screaming,

30:56.880 --> 30:58.400
baby wants to fuck.

30:58.400 --> 31:06.960
And he takes a segment of Isabella Rossellini's robe and manipulates her genitals with it.

31:06.960 --> 31:09.600
I was thinking to myself, that seems unsanitary.

31:09.600 --> 31:13.600
He should have stopped at ExtremeRestraints.com.

31:13.600 --> 31:17.920
It's an adult superstore, so you don't have to fuck Isabella Rossellini with your hands

31:17.920 --> 31:18.960
wrapped in robe.

31:19.520 --> 31:23.680
Imagine what other classic movies would be like if they had extreme restraints in them.

31:23.680 --> 31:28.160
Yeah, you could just go get a woman's fetish uniform.

31:28.800 --> 31:32.240
Baby likes to fuck, well get her something that's appropriate for that.

31:32.240 --> 31:33.440
Get her nurse perverse.

31:33.440 --> 31:41.040
It's a beautiful nurse's costume with some really tasteful covers over her nipples and

31:41.040 --> 31:43.120
it looks great, very sexual.

31:43.120 --> 31:44.640
Is it cotton?

31:44.640 --> 31:47.200
If it's not cotton, I can't wear it.

31:47.200 --> 31:50.000
I don't know, but I would assume it's all natural.

31:50.880 --> 31:52.800
It's probably edible too, I don't know.

31:53.520 --> 31:55.200
It's made of fruit roll-ups.

31:56.000 --> 32:02.080
It's also a silicone, there's also a silicone deluxe come-through penis plug.

32:02.080 --> 32:09.600
So when you don't want to take the time to take your plug out, you can come I guess through

32:09.600 --> 32:10.320
it or around it.

32:10.320 --> 32:13.760
I'm not exactly sure of the physics, but what I am sure of is that you're going to save

32:13.760 --> 32:14.560
a lot of money.

32:14.560 --> 32:19.040
You come into an envelope and then you mail it to your lover.

32:19.040 --> 32:20.320
Please don't do that to us.

32:20.960 --> 32:24.720
You mail it to yourself in the past and you're like, how?

32:24.720 --> 32:25.440
When did this happen?

32:25.440 --> 32:27.440
That's how you patent your comb.

32:28.400 --> 32:29.840
That's how you patent your comb.

32:29.840 --> 32:33.280
That is actually in most courts as long as there is a postmark on it.

32:33.280 --> 32:34.400
That will hold up in court.

32:36.080 --> 32:38.560
I'm sorry, I couldn't be the father.

32:38.560 --> 32:44.720
But don't wait too long because then that semen will grow into a baby as we all know.

32:44.720 --> 32:48.640
You'll get another mailbox baby.

32:48.640 --> 32:50.080
God, it's such a shame, isn't it?

32:51.520 --> 32:54.960
Isn't it such a shame, these mailbox babies?

32:54.960 --> 33:06.960
Thanks to ExtremeRestraints.com, I have seen more manipulated, twisted, plugged dicks than

33:06.960 --> 33:08.800
I have normal dicks.

33:08.800 --> 33:12.640
I no longer have a barometer for what a regular penis looks like.

33:12.640 --> 33:18.000
So often have I seen them caged and pinned like a wild boar.

33:18.000 --> 33:23.520
I didn't know until we started perusing the JPEGs on Extreme Restraints, I didn't know

33:23.520 --> 33:26.720
about the secret sex hole that you have on the back of your head.

33:31.200 --> 33:32.240
It's called your Gorka.

33:33.120 --> 33:34.800
No, no.

33:34.800 --> 33:37.520
No, I don't think it's called your Gorka.

33:37.520 --> 33:43.120
So our friend James Medina at Extreme Restraints sent me a list of some suggested products

33:43.120 --> 33:43.760
to talk about.

33:44.480 --> 33:50.800
Oh my god, the best one is the last one and it is the Kinky Kyle Head and Body Masturbator,

33:50.800 --> 33:55.760
which I thought at first when reading the title was like a suit that you wore that masturbated

33:55.760 --> 33:57.200
your whole body at the same time.

33:57.200 --> 33:57.920
Oh my god.

33:57.920 --> 33:59.120
What's up 2013?

33:59.760 --> 34:00.720
But it's not.

34:01.760 --> 34:06.880
It is in fact a full body that you use to masturbate.

34:06.880 --> 34:08.160
Oh okay, I like it.

34:08.160 --> 34:08.960
That's just sex.

34:08.960 --> 34:12.960
And he has eyes, which is weird.

34:13.680 --> 34:18.240
So search Kinky Kyle Head and Body Masturbator at ExtremeRestraints.com.

34:18.240 --> 34:26.640
If you say that sex is just using someone else's body to masturbate, is that the creepiest thing?

34:26.640 --> 34:29.440
Basically a pretty terrible thing to say out loud.

34:29.440 --> 34:35.440
I do want to say though that the best thing I've ever said out loud to counterbalance

34:35.440 --> 34:42.000
that terrible thing your girlfriend said is that you can save 20% at ExtremeRestraints.com

34:42.640 --> 34:47.840
if you enter the coupon code MIDDLEST as you're checking out.

34:47.840 --> 34:48.880
You're going to save 20%.

34:52.320 --> 34:56.080
If you get off, let's get serious.

34:57.200 --> 35:01.360
If you get off, sorry, when you get off using one of these fun products,

35:02.800 --> 35:07.200
it's basically going to be because of us, because of the savings that we've just passed along to you.

35:08.640 --> 35:08.960
Yes, you're welcome.

35:08.960 --> 35:11.520
20% of your orgasm belongs to us.

35:11.520 --> 35:15.520
Yeah, so if you could scoop up approximately 20% of the,

35:15.520 --> 35:20.480
toss that bitch in an envelope, maybe send it our way.

35:20.480 --> 35:22.720
P.O. Box, what is the number Justin?

35:23.520 --> 35:24.080
Sorry?

35:24.080 --> 35:25.600
The P.O. Box.

35:25.600 --> 35:32.160
P.O. Box 54, like the car, hunting to West Virginia, 25706.

35:32.160 --> 35:33.840
Please don't, please.

35:33.840 --> 35:35.920
Don't send us an envelope of your cum.

35:35.920 --> 35:36.640
Stop it.

35:38.640 --> 35:40.640
Stop now, this isn't funny anymore.

35:40.640 --> 35:41.200
Oh, check it out.

35:41.200 --> 35:43.440
What if they seal the envelope with it and we'd never know?

35:43.440 --> 35:46.480
Oh, what if they've already done that?

35:46.480 --> 35:50.720
What if I'm going to quit forever and I don't just mean this show, but life?

35:52.320 --> 35:54.400
I don't have the strength to go on anymore.

35:54.400 --> 35:55.360
How about a Yahoo answer?

35:56.640 --> 35:59.200
Extremetist.com, KuboKubo Middle is 20%.

35:59.920 --> 36:00.720
Hit me, Griffin.

36:00.720 --> 36:02.720
I have a question about pubes and a question about porn.

36:02.720 --> 36:06.800
I'm worried that following up that whole seg with one of these-

36:06.800 --> 36:07.600
Yeah, maybe not.

36:07.600 --> 36:08.480
Maybe something about-

36:09.200 --> 36:10.640
Ira Ray sent this in.

36:10.640 --> 36:12.400
Do you have anything about Sanford and Son?

36:12.400 --> 36:13.600
I don't.

36:13.600 --> 36:15.200
This Yahoo answer was sent in by Ira Ray.

36:15.200 --> 36:15.600
Thank you, Ira.

36:15.600 --> 36:16.080
It's by Yahoo!

36:16.080 --> 36:16.880
And it's by Tyler.

36:16.880 --> 36:18.160
Are you Ira Ray?

36:18.720 --> 36:19.600
Who wants to know?

36:21.920 --> 36:23.360
It's a tag, it's a stinger.

36:24.640 --> 36:26.000
It's not a joke, it's a stinger.

36:26.720 --> 36:28.080
It's an audio stinger.

36:28.080 --> 36:28.400
Yahoo!

36:28.400 --> 36:33.840
And it's by Tyler asks, for school, we have to make a pretend restaurant

36:33.840 --> 36:35.040
and I need a catchy slogan.

36:36.000 --> 36:39.200
My restaurant's name is Tyler and Kyle's Totally Bodacious Rib Shack.

36:39.200 --> 36:40.880
I'm sorry, one more time.

36:40.880 --> 36:44.400
My restaurant's name is Kyle and Tyler's Totally Bodacious Rib Shack.

36:44.400 --> 36:45.920
We have seafood and barbecue.

36:47.920 --> 36:53.600
I needed to know so much more about K&T's TBRS.

36:55.600 --> 36:59.520
Kyle and Tyler's Totally Bodacious Barbecue and Fish.

36:59.520 --> 37:02.640
Where the food is as good as it looks.

37:05.440 --> 37:07.840
It is as bodacious as it looks.

37:07.840 --> 37:10.480
It is as bodacious as you may have heard.

37:11.280 --> 37:14.960
As bodacious as you believe in your heart that it is.

37:14.960 --> 37:17.280
We are not shitting you about the bodacious.

37:17.280 --> 37:19.040
Come eat some fucking torsos.

37:19.840 --> 37:21.280
Tykel and Kyler.

37:21.280 --> 37:21.600
Food?

37:22.640 --> 37:23.920
I'm sorry, what were their names?

37:27.680 --> 37:30.480
And when did it go from being an awesome rib shack

37:30.480 --> 37:34.000
to being like a highfalutin, like micro food kind of place?

37:35.440 --> 37:37.440
Have you been to that new coffee shop?

37:37.440 --> 37:39.360
It's totally shade grown, organic.

37:39.360 --> 37:41.280
They only serve one cup a day.

37:41.280 --> 37:42.880
It's called Tykel and Kyler's.

37:45.040 --> 37:46.320
They also have gift sets.

37:48.800 --> 37:49.300
Fuck.

37:50.240 --> 37:52.560
Why is this a thing that your school's making you do?

37:55.360 --> 37:57.360
Do you think this guy's teacher is like,

37:57.360 --> 37:59.520
I can't wait to get out of the fucking teaching biz.

37:59.520 --> 38:02.480
Got to open up my own restaurant, but I just have no ideas.

38:02.480 --> 38:06.160
Griffin, I know that people are always talking

38:06.160 --> 38:09.920
about us talking too much about Dawson's Creek on this show,

38:09.920 --> 38:12.160
but it seems like a fine time to bring up

38:12.160 --> 38:14.880
Dawson's dad's restaurant concept.

38:14.880 --> 38:17.280
For those not familiar with the show,

38:17.280 --> 38:20.400
for literally two seasons of this program,

38:20.400 --> 38:24.000
Dawson's dad's job was to build a model of a restaurant

38:24.000 --> 38:25.680
where everyone wore scuba gear.

38:26.560 --> 38:27.360
That was his profession.

38:27.360 --> 38:28.560
And it wasn't a joke?

38:28.560 --> 38:30.000
No, it wasn't a gag.

38:30.000 --> 38:31.840
That was his goddamn J.O.B.

38:31.840 --> 38:34.080
Every time they panned this poor,

38:34.640 --> 38:37.440
formerly the Flash motherfucker,

38:37.440 --> 38:41.680
it's him putting a helmet on a little guy

38:41.680 --> 38:43.280
in a scuba-themed restaurant.

38:44.080 --> 38:45.520
But he also had his other restaurant,

38:45.520 --> 38:50.240
which was Dawson's dad's 100% safe car floor ice cream.

38:52.480 --> 38:53.680
Sorry, spoiler alert.

38:53.680 --> 38:56.160
Spoiler alert, season four, Dawson's Creek.

38:56.160 --> 38:58.160
If you haven't watched it, I apologize for the spoiler.

38:58.160 --> 38:59.680
I think we've talked about this before.

38:59.680 --> 39:00.560
I think I edited it out

39:00.560 --> 39:02.720
because I was really worried about spoiling Dawson's Creek.

39:02.720 --> 39:05.920
What's awesome about the scuba-themed restaurant

39:05.920 --> 39:09.520
is that later in the show,

39:10.240 --> 39:13.760
Dawson's family did in fact have a fish restaurant,

39:14.800 --> 39:16.080
but had none of the...

39:18.080 --> 39:22.320
There was no even tip of the hat to its more scuba-themed...

39:22.960 --> 39:25.680
There was apparently an off-camera conversation

39:25.680 --> 39:26.720
between Mitch and Gale,

39:26.720 --> 39:27.520
where Gale's like,

39:27.520 --> 39:30.800
listen, Mitch, this is the dumbest goddamn idea ever.

39:30.800 --> 39:32.160
You know what people like?

39:32.160 --> 39:32.960
Fish.

39:32.960 --> 39:33.920
You know what people hate?

39:33.920 --> 39:35.520
Helmets and tubes.

39:37.040 --> 39:38.480
I'm not doing this with you anymore.

39:40.160 --> 39:41.040
Let's get a divorce.

39:42.560 --> 39:43.840
Sydney often tries to convince me

39:43.840 --> 39:46.080
that Dawson's Creek is actually the story of Mitch and Gale.

39:47.040 --> 39:49.120
That everyone else is ancillary.

39:50.400 --> 39:51.120
Well, I mean...

39:52.160 --> 39:52.720
Think about it.

39:52.720 --> 39:53.920
It really makes a lot of sense.

39:53.920 --> 39:55.280
Categorically, it does it.

39:55.840 --> 39:57.040
I mean, if you think about...

39:57.040 --> 39:57.360
She...

39:57.360 --> 39:59.760
That's her time to regroup, anyway.

39:59.760 --> 40:02.400
I have recently taken a listen to audiobooks

40:02.400 --> 40:05.120
to help pass the time during life's four menial tasks.

40:05.680 --> 40:07.760
Once I complete listening to one,

40:07.760 --> 40:09.280
can I claim that I have read it?

40:09.280 --> 40:11.040
Or do I tell people I have only listened

40:11.040 --> 40:13.760
to every single word over the course of 10 hours?

40:13.760 --> 40:16.160
That's from Wondering in Woodstock.

40:18.080 --> 40:20.640
Travis, I bet you have an opinion about this.

40:20.640 --> 40:22.320
I do, and it's awful.

40:22.320 --> 40:25.840
The ship is still on its steady course.

40:25.840 --> 40:26.480
Yes.

40:26.480 --> 40:27.200
Yep.

40:27.200 --> 40:29.920
The problem is, yes, you can say that you read it,

40:29.920 --> 40:33.520
but you'll have to 100% of the time follow that up by saying,

40:33.520 --> 40:35.680
well, I mean, I listened to it.

40:36.480 --> 40:38.960
And so it's better just not to bring it up.

40:38.960 --> 40:41.040
You're getting the information in your fucking brain.

40:42.240 --> 40:42.960
You would be amazed.

40:42.960 --> 40:43.840
But you'd be amazed, though.

40:44.400 --> 40:46.320
I've had this argument with people before,

40:46.320 --> 40:47.760
because I agree with you, Griffin.

40:47.760 --> 40:48.800
But the number of people who say,

40:49.440 --> 40:53.920
no, taking in audio information and visual information

40:53.920 --> 40:59.360
is completely different, and you don't hold it the same way.

40:59.360 --> 41:01.040
Now, I will say this.

41:01.040 --> 41:03.600
I could see why having somebody read it to you

41:04.400 --> 41:07.440
tends to put their inflection on things.

41:07.440 --> 41:10.720
And you don't hear it in your own voices in your head.

41:10.720 --> 41:11.840
You hear it through them.

41:12.400 --> 41:15.200
So I could see where that would affect it a little bit.

41:15.200 --> 41:16.960
But you're still getting the story.

41:16.960 --> 41:18.240
You're still getting the words.

41:19.120 --> 41:20.800
You're still getting fucking smarter.

41:20.800 --> 41:22.880
I don't understand why these people have to stand.

41:22.880 --> 41:24.560
You're trying to do better.

41:24.560 --> 41:26.480
And they're like, mm, but it's indifferent.

41:27.280 --> 41:29.840
Fucking, man, fuck those Beekmans.

41:29.840 --> 41:30.480
You don't need that.

41:30.480 --> 41:31.040
All right.

41:31.040 --> 41:32.480
I don't think any of these Beekmans

41:32.480 --> 41:34.960
are ever going to quiz you on a-

41:34.960 --> 41:37.200
How did the paper feel in your hands then?

41:37.200 --> 41:39.600
Describe the textile element.

41:39.600 --> 41:41.120
I mean, how is it different?

41:41.120 --> 41:44.480
I mean, it seems to me like the same kind of progression

41:44.480 --> 41:47.200
of reading a book or getting it on a Kindle.

41:47.200 --> 41:49.040
Except, hey, guess what, idiots?

41:49.040 --> 41:51.360
I can listen and do other stuff at the same time.

41:51.360 --> 41:53.440
You can listen to that book and read another book.

41:53.440 --> 41:54.560
Double books.

41:54.560 --> 41:55.840
Yeah, you know what you can't do?

41:55.840 --> 41:57.360
Read a book and drive a car.

41:57.360 --> 41:57.680
Yeah.

41:57.680 --> 41:59.840
I can listen to the book on tape and drive a car

41:59.840 --> 42:00.720
at the same time.

42:00.720 --> 42:02.240
Who's smart now, Beekman?

42:02.240 --> 42:02.800
Me.

42:02.800 --> 42:06.160
Now, let me ask you the slightly more complex question.

42:06.960 --> 42:09.360
What if the audio version is abridged?

42:10.080 --> 42:11.760
Oh, well, then it doesn't count.

42:11.760 --> 42:13.760
It does, though, because when you read a book,

42:13.760 --> 42:15.040
you're automatically abridging it,

42:15.040 --> 42:16.720
because everybody knows that when you read a book,

42:16.720 --> 42:18.640
you're really only reading every other paragraph.

42:19.200 --> 42:19.920
Tops.

42:19.920 --> 42:20.720
Tops.

42:20.720 --> 42:22.400
You'll read a sentence and be like,

42:22.400 --> 42:25.440
John woke up and looked outside, and you're like,

42:25.440 --> 42:27.520
well, he's about to describe some fucking trees

42:27.520 --> 42:29.200
for like 200 words, so I'm just going to go ahead

42:29.200 --> 42:30.960
and skip around and look for the word tits.

42:31.680 --> 42:34.000
You know, when I was in elementary school

42:34.000 --> 42:36.880
and I had to read books for the Accelerated Reader program

42:36.880 --> 42:40.080
and then take quizzes on it, I would read every other page.

42:40.080 --> 42:40.400
Yeah.

42:40.400 --> 42:42.400
And I aced every single one of those tests.

42:42.400 --> 42:44.000
Sure, because you're a very lucky man.

42:44.800 --> 42:47.200
Well, I got the basic gist of Treasure Island.

42:47.200 --> 42:50.240
Now, maybe I was confused as to where some characters came from.

42:50.240 --> 42:50.720
Yeah.

42:50.720 --> 42:52.560
But I knew who the characters were.

42:52.560 --> 42:53.600
And it was fifth grade.

42:53.600 --> 42:56.960
It's not like they were, like, really in-depth quizzes.

42:56.960 --> 42:59.760
It was like, what was the name of the evil pirate?

42:59.760 --> 43:00.960
You're like, Long John Silver.

43:00.960 --> 43:03.360
I learned that in the first, like, 10 pages.

43:03.360 --> 43:06.000
What if Travis did that and became the first dude

43:06.000 --> 43:08.400
to ever understand Finnegan's Wake?

43:08.400 --> 43:11.280
Like, everyone's like, oh, shit, yeah, every other page.

43:11.280 --> 43:13.120
Oh, it was like a codex.

43:13.120 --> 43:14.960
Okay, you had to read every other page,

43:14.960 --> 43:15.760
and then they connected.

43:15.760 --> 43:17.120
Unless one of the pages you were skipping

43:17.120 --> 43:18.160
had the word tits on it.

43:18.160 --> 43:20.560
You quickly scan.

43:20.560 --> 43:22.880
Yeah, that's why the Kindle is great,

43:22.880 --> 43:25.600
because you can just, like, search for the word tits.

43:25.600 --> 43:26.960
Control F, yeah.

43:27.520 --> 43:28.720
Sometimes they don't say tits, though.

43:28.720 --> 43:30.560
Sometimes they say, like, titties.

43:32.880 --> 43:35.680
James Joyce used them interchangeably.

43:35.680 --> 43:36.480
So if you search one,

43:36.480 --> 43:38.400
you're really going to be missing out on, like, half the book.

43:39.200 --> 43:41.120
That's why it's better just to type tit,

43:41.120 --> 43:42.480
and it'll pull up both.

43:44.080 --> 43:45.680
No, because then you could get, like, title.

43:46.800 --> 43:47.760
Oh, that's true.

43:47.760 --> 43:49.200
And nobody wants to waste time.

43:49.200 --> 43:51.120
Or, like, titular, and then you're like,

43:51.120 --> 43:53.600
oh, damn, it's not what I thought it meant.

43:53.600 --> 43:56.080
Or titay, which is sexy.

43:56.720 --> 43:57.840
It's not sexy or something.

43:57.840 --> 44:00.720
I forgot about, yeah, James Joyce also peppered.

44:01.280 --> 44:02.640
Peppered his words with that.

44:02.640 --> 44:04.400
Actually, he coined the term titay.

44:05.360 --> 44:07.120
Actually, the only character in Finnegan's Wake

44:07.120 --> 44:10.560
that uses the term titay is Meth-Daryl,

44:10.560 --> 44:12.640
and everyone knows that you could skip

44:12.640 --> 44:14.080
all the Meth-Daryl sections

44:14.080 --> 44:16.720
and really take just as much away from the novel.

44:16.720 --> 44:18.320
That's why when you search it on your Kindle,

44:18.320 --> 44:21.280
you got to do the minus sign, Meth-Daryl,

44:21.280 --> 44:24.400
so that way it will edit Meth-Daryl out of the book for you.

44:24.400 --> 44:25.840
Did you know you can do that with Kindle?

44:25.840 --> 44:27.680
Just edit out whole sections of the book.

44:27.680 --> 44:29.760
Yeah, books are the fucking worst.

44:30.720 --> 44:32.480
Yeah, yeah, I get it, books.

44:32.480 --> 44:33.600
You had your chance.

44:33.600 --> 44:34.080
If I could shoot-

44:34.080 --> 44:35.840
Maybe if you had pictures and you talked.

44:35.840 --> 44:37.040
Oh, wait, that's movies.

44:37.040 --> 44:38.640
Get the fuck out, books.

44:38.640 --> 44:42.240
I read books for the first, like, 16 years

44:42.880 --> 44:46.400
I was alive before computers and everything.

44:46.400 --> 44:48.480
And I really feel like books have had their chance.

44:49.040 --> 44:51.120
At this point, if I'm not reading anymore,

44:51.120 --> 44:52.720
isn't that really their fault?

44:53.440 --> 44:55.840
Like, didn't they have a chance to get their claws into me?

44:56.480 --> 44:58.320
Let me ask you guys a next level question.

44:58.320 --> 44:59.120
Okay, me.

44:59.120 --> 45:01.760
Okay, so we agree that when you listen to the book on tape,

45:01.760 --> 45:03.040
you can say you read it, right?

45:03.040 --> 45:03.680
Yeah.

45:03.680 --> 45:06.320
What if you watch a really, like,

45:06.320 --> 45:10.160
accurate movie version of a book?

45:10.160 --> 45:11.680
Sure, I don't-

45:11.680 --> 45:12.640
You say you read it.

45:12.640 --> 45:16.880
I think if-

45:16.880 --> 45:18.160
I see, I think with a movie,

45:18.160 --> 45:23.600
you run a real risk of saying the one thing that, like,

45:25.520 --> 45:28.800
lets the person know that you only saw the movie.

45:28.800 --> 45:31.040
Like, I think that that's a long distance scam.

45:31.040 --> 45:32.880
So, but like, with Game of Thrones,

45:32.880 --> 45:35.600
where they made, like, 10 episodes of one book,

45:35.600 --> 45:38.160
that's pretty accurate, you know?

45:38.160 --> 45:39.840
Like, I feel like that covers it.

45:39.840 --> 45:42.880
Yeah, but I think in Game of Thrones,

45:43.680 --> 45:47.760
you, is a rare example of where you should be more embarrassed

45:47.760 --> 45:49.920
to have read the book, all right?

45:49.920 --> 45:53.200
Because you're saying instead of actually seeing

45:53.200 --> 45:55.840
some real juggerugs on TV-

45:55.840 --> 45:56.400
Oh my God.

45:56.400 --> 45:57.440
I'd rather read-

45:57.440 --> 45:59.280
I was coined by James Joyce.

45:59.280 --> 46:01.920
I'd rather read a fat bearded man tell me about this.

46:01.920 --> 46:03.920
I don't know, cause that fat bearded man

46:03.920 --> 46:08.000
can weave a tapestry of adjectives to describe-

46:08.000 --> 46:11.520
The words he creates discuss titties.

46:11.520 --> 46:14.080
He fucking goes centimeter by centimeter

46:14.080 --> 46:18.400
describing every bump, every nook and cranny of the areola.

46:18.400 --> 46:19.520
He gets in there-

46:19.520 --> 46:22.160
George R.R. Martin is a man who knows his nipples.

46:22.160 --> 46:25.600
He gets in on and around those titties.

46:26.320 --> 46:28.960
He gets you inside the mind of the titty.

46:28.960 --> 46:31.040
Yeah, you really know what the titty's thinking,

46:31.040 --> 46:32.960
and I mean, you can feel-

46:32.960 --> 46:35.280
Justin, Justin, titty.

46:35.280 --> 46:37.360
You can feel the lactation.

46:37.360 --> 46:40.000
I'm saying sometimes when you read them,

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
you can really feel that kind of thing.

46:42.880 --> 46:46.640
If his descriptions of breasts are so exquisite,

46:46.640 --> 46:49.200
you would almost swear they were edible

46:49.200 --> 46:51.440
because those are the only other things

46:51.440 --> 46:54.560
that get his attention in that fashion.

46:55.600 --> 46:57.360
It activates the same part of,

46:58.400 --> 47:01.440
well, not everyone's brain, but certainly George R.R. Martin's.

47:01.440 --> 47:03.840
The only thing George R.R. Martin likes

47:03.840 --> 47:07.680
is food and breasts and ways to avoid walking.

47:07.680 --> 47:11.120
If he can do any of those three, he is stoked.

47:11.680 --> 47:12.560
I don't know him personally.

47:12.560 --> 47:13.840
He's probably a very sweet man.

47:14.800 --> 47:16.480
Who knows a lot about boobies.

47:16.480 --> 47:16.960
He does.

47:16.960 --> 47:18.800
I mean, he writes, he can write a boob.

47:19.600 --> 47:20.640
That's all I'm saying.

47:20.640 --> 47:21.200
He can write a boob.

47:21.200 --> 47:23.680
I do find it weird when there are entire chapters

47:23.680 --> 47:26.640
from the perspective of tits.

47:27.200 --> 47:29.120
Like that seems a little excessive.

47:29.120 --> 47:31.600
It's like the tits heaved up and down

47:31.600 --> 47:35.040
and they didn't see much until they got out to fuck.

47:35.040 --> 47:37.840
And then the kings died.

47:37.840 --> 47:40.640
There's that one point in the book

47:40.640 --> 47:42.480
where it tangented off

47:42.480 --> 47:45.440
to a time when George R.R. Martin saw some boobs

47:45.440 --> 47:47.840
and it had nothing to do with the story he was telling,

47:47.840 --> 47:49.280
but it took over from the narrator.

47:49.280 --> 47:54.480
It was the summer of 75 in the back of my dad's chevillette.

47:55.920 --> 47:59.360
The blood of Reggie Stark splashed onto the boobs

47:59.360 --> 48:02.560
and then they knew that the king had perished.

48:04.880 --> 48:07.440
And there was not a dry boob in the house that day.

48:07.440 --> 48:10.720
Not a dry boob as all the boobs were covered in tears

48:10.720 --> 48:12.960
of the families that had lost men that day.

48:14.000 --> 48:16.720
And House Stark always knew that winter was boobing.

48:17.360 --> 48:20.560
So it was so many men were lost that day.

48:21.120 --> 48:24.880
So many hearts broken just below the breasts.

48:24.880 --> 48:27.040
You can read more in the final chapter

48:27.040 --> 48:29.280
of the Game of Thrones series titled

48:31.120 --> 48:32.240
A Barrel of Jugs.

48:36.240 --> 48:37.440
My girlfriend and I recently got engaged.

48:37.440 --> 48:38.640
Dragon tits.

48:38.640 --> 48:39.040
Sorry, you going home?

48:39.040 --> 48:39.840
Dragon tits.

48:41.280 --> 48:45.360
A song of ice and fire and boobs.

48:45.360 --> 48:45.840
Okay.

48:45.840 --> 48:47.600
My girlfriend and I recently got engaged.

48:47.600 --> 48:49.040
We started planning our wedding.

48:49.040 --> 48:51.200
We're having a problem filling out our guest registry.

48:51.200 --> 48:53.280
Each of us have lived in the registry.

48:53.280 --> 48:53.920
What did I say?

48:53.920 --> 48:54.400
Guest.

48:54.400 --> 48:54.900
Guest.

48:54.900 --> 48:57.380
We're having a problem filling out our gift.

48:57.380 --> 48:58.260
Should I start at the beginning?

48:58.260 --> 48:59.460
Would that be easier to edit?

48:59.460 --> 49:02.100
No, it sort of plays into the narrative thread of this podcast

49:02.100 --> 49:05.780
of you being whacked out of your mind on a single,

49:05.780 --> 49:07.620
off of a single mineral.

49:08.740 --> 49:11.620
They lived alone before moving in together.

49:11.620 --> 49:13.460
So we already own a lot of stuff.

49:14.100 --> 49:16.180
What should we include on our registry

49:16.180 --> 49:18.500
to ensure a life of wedded bliss?

49:18.500 --> 49:21.460
And that's from wanting some free shit.

49:22.260 --> 49:23.940
I think you are missing the point.

49:23.940 --> 49:24.900
Wait, sir.

49:25.780 --> 49:29.220
The point here is not to get stuff you don't already have.

49:29.220 --> 49:31.700
It's to get the new awesome adult version

49:31.700 --> 49:34.900
of the childish shit you bought for 20 bucks at Walmart.

49:34.900 --> 49:35.140
Right.

49:36.580 --> 49:40.340
Like everybody's got the economy class of stuff.

49:40.340 --> 49:41.700
This is your chance to say,

49:41.700 --> 49:46.020
hey, maybe, you know, Spurge and buy me the fancy iron.

49:46.020 --> 49:47.940
Everybody's got the coffee maker

49:47.940 --> 49:50.340
that will just literally just tip over

49:50.340 --> 49:52.260
and spill coffee all over the ground.

49:52.260 --> 49:55.140
And if you let brew more than three cups at a time,

49:55.140 --> 49:56.340
everybody's got that already.

49:56.900 --> 49:58.020
But maybe these people are into that.

49:58.020 --> 49:59.700
Maybe these people are into shabby chic

49:59.700 --> 50:01.940
and we can't, you don't want to take that from them.

50:01.940 --> 50:02.740
You know?

50:02.740 --> 50:04.900
Well, if that's the case, then you need to widen,

50:05.860 --> 50:07.140
widen your mind.

50:07.140 --> 50:07.540
Yeah.

50:07.540 --> 50:10.820
And you know, go like do a gift registry at like Home Depot

50:10.820 --> 50:11.860
and get some tools.

50:11.860 --> 50:14.020
I guarantee you don't have tools.

50:14.020 --> 50:16.100
Listen, you can't, you're so young.

50:16.100 --> 50:17.780
You can't already have,

50:17.780 --> 50:19.540
if you already have all the material possessions

50:19.540 --> 50:20.180
you want right now,

50:20.180 --> 50:22.100
what are you going to distract yourself

50:22.100 --> 50:24.260
with when the magic wears off, you know?

50:24.260 --> 50:24.820
Getting a really bad fight.

50:24.820 --> 50:26.020
Why'd you want to surf for toys?

50:26.020 --> 50:26.820
They get in a really bad fight

50:26.820 --> 50:28.180
where they break all the shit that they have.

50:29.220 --> 50:30.180
Oh, that's true.

50:30.980 --> 50:34.020
You know, I have a few different options here.

50:34.020 --> 50:36.500
My wife and I ran into something similar to this.

50:36.500 --> 50:40.980
We actually had people buy us parts of our honeymoon.

50:42.660 --> 50:46.580
We had a registry where you could buy like dinner one night

50:46.580 --> 50:48.660
or one night in our hotel room or whatever.

50:48.660 --> 50:51.700
Uh, so you, so we did that.

50:51.700 --> 50:54.340
Um, I also had friends,

50:54.340 --> 50:57.700
our friends John and Rissy went the opposite direction

50:57.700 --> 51:00.820
and they registered at Target for shit they didn't need.

51:00.820 --> 51:04.020
So we ended up buying them a copy of Trivial Pursuit

51:04.020 --> 51:06.420
and a large jar of nacho cheese

51:06.420 --> 51:08.100
because they had registered for it.

51:08.100 --> 51:10.740
Now what's to make you think they don't need that?

51:10.740 --> 51:12.580
I mean, they certainly consumed it.

51:12.580 --> 51:13.140
I'm sure.

51:13.140 --> 51:13.640
Right.

51:14.180 --> 51:15.220
And I'm just saying that like,

51:15.940 --> 51:16.980
if you look around your house,

51:16.980 --> 51:19.460
I'm sure that you could use some new bath towels

51:19.460 --> 51:21.300
or, you know, something like that.

51:21.300 --> 51:22.820
You, you probably are not thinking

51:23.620 --> 51:25.380
about all the new shit you could get.

51:25.380 --> 51:29.060
I think we're just gonna ask for money to like get a house.

51:29.060 --> 51:32.020
But like, if people don't give us enough money at the wedding

51:32.020 --> 51:34.420
to pay for an entire house, then we don't let them leave.

51:35.300 --> 51:36.500
Here's the problem though, Griffin.

51:36.500 --> 51:39.140
That's not a bad idea, but there are people in this world

51:39.140 --> 51:42.740
that like for some reason are just so opposed to giving money

51:42.740 --> 51:45.700
that you have to give them some kind of option.

51:45.700 --> 51:49.060
Everything that I've read, everybody I've talked to is like,

51:49.060 --> 51:51.060
you need to go and register for at least like three things.

51:51.060 --> 51:52.820
Oh, we've thought, we, yeah, yeah.

51:52.820 --> 51:53.540
I mean, we thought of that.

51:53.540 --> 51:54.900
You can either give us money for a house

51:54.900 --> 51:57.060
or the keys to the house that you got us.

51:57.060 --> 51:57.540
Uh-huh.

51:57.540 --> 51:58.260
We're kind of house crazy.

51:58.260 --> 52:00.020
Or just keys to a house.

52:00.020 --> 52:00.340
It's fun.

52:00.340 --> 52:01.700
And then we have to find it.

52:02.420 --> 52:03.300
It's like the Goonies.

52:04.020 --> 52:05.620
Why don't you register for some guns?

52:06.660 --> 52:08.420
Yeah, because Obama's gonna take them

52:08.420 --> 52:11.220
before they can even like get married.

52:11.780 --> 52:12.820
That would be terrible.

52:12.820 --> 52:13.780
I love video games.

52:13.780 --> 52:15.380
Can you register for toys?

52:15.380 --> 52:16.180
I think so.

52:16.180 --> 52:16.900
Yeah, you can.

52:16.900 --> 52:19.940
It's just like, you're not, the people who are gonna buy you

52:19.940 --> 52:24.660
things off your registry, I think one, you lose out on,

52:24.660 --> 52:27.620
by not having items in your registry, you lose out on people

52:27.620 --> 52:30.900
who aren't gonna enter, like people who aren't gonna attend,

52:30.900 --> 52:34.420
but will go through the easy, like few clicks to send you a gift

52:34.420 --> 52:35.940
to let you know they're thinking about you.

52:35.940 --> 52:39.540
So like, if you look around at your household goods,

52:40.500 --> 52:42.740
if you live in America, you better get real,

52:42.740 --> 52:46.660
you better get real used to the idea of being dissatisfied

52:46.660 --> 52:48.100
with your material possessions.

52:48.660 --> 52:51.220
And right now you're thinking good enough,

52:51.220 --> 52:53.060
and we don't know that term here.

52:53.060 --> 52:54.580
We always want bigger and better.

52:54.580 --> 52:57.860
Your towel's fine, but can you wrap your whole body in it

52:57.860 --> 52:58.900
three times and then your head and also feet?

52:58.900 --> 53:00.980
Is it still as fluffy as it was when you bought it

53:00.980 --> 53:01.860
three months ago?

53:01.860 --> 53:02.500
Is your love?

53:04.420 --> 53:06.740
You're saying that there's always better shit.

53:07.300 --> 53:08.900
There's always newer shit.

53:09.540 --> 53:12.580
Watch like Cribs and pick one thing on there.

53:12.580 --> 53:14.420
It's better than the thing you have at your house.

53:14.420 --> 53:16.020
Unless you're watching a real bummer episode

53:16.020 --> 53:17.780
like Sean William Scott or something.

53:17.780 --> 53:18.820
Wait, was his a bummer?

53:19.540 --> 53:22.100
Oh God, he just lived in an apartment with two other dudes.

53:23.460 --> 53:25.140
Did you ever see Red Man?

53:25.140 --> 53:29.220
Red Man had piss in his toilet and his doorbell was broken.

53:29.940 --> 53:31.860
Sean William Scott lived in an apartment with like

53:31.860 --> 53:34.020
two other guys and they had two rooms

53:34.020 --> 53:35.460
and they were like sharing a bed

53:35.460 --> 53:37.860
and there were boxes of pizza all over the floor.

53:37.860 --> 53:39.940
I did not know how they got on television,

53:39.940 --> 53:40.580
but it was amazing.

53:40.580 --> 53:42.980
That's amazing. It's like Sean William Scott

53:42.980 --> 53:46.180
was totally recognized the fact that his star

53:46.180 --> 53:48.260
was going to burn so bright and so fast.

53:48.900 --> 53:51.460
Like I cannot afford to go by.

53:51.460 --> 53:54.180
Like don't be silly right now.

53:54.180 --> 53:55.460
Thank you, Sean William Scott.

53:55.460 --> 53:56.660
Thanks for the, thanks for.

53:56.660 --> 53:59.140
You were, you were so good at Meet the Needles.

54:00.980 --> 54:03.060
I don't think that was, I don't think that was his.

54:03.060 --> 54:04.900
Pretty sure he wasn't in Meet the Needles.

54:04.900 --> 54:05.780
Pretty sure.

54:05.780 --> 54:07.060
Do you have a Yahoo that would be good?

54:07.940 --> 54:09.860
What's the one about pubes you talked about?

54:09.860 --> 54:12.180
Yeah, let's chart that old pubes number out.

54:12.180 --> 54:13.860
You mentioned something about pubes,

54:13.860 --> 54:14.660
if I'm not mistaken.

54:14.660 --> 54:16.340
This, something in a pubes.

54:16.340 --> 54:17.460
This was sent in by Layla.

54:17.460 --> 54:18.100
Thanks, Layla.

54:18.740 --> 54:20.580
It's, I mean, you, I feel like I've already spoiled the,

54:21.860 --> 54:23.620
I feel like I've already ruined the prestige.

54:24.260 --> 54:24.500
Okay.

54:27.700 --> 54:30.100
This is asked by Yahoo answers user Keith who asks,

54:31.460 --> 54:33.860
how do I prevent my dog from eating pubic hair

54:33.860 --> 54:34.900
he finds in the bathroom?

54:35.460 --> 54:35.780
Okay.

54:37.780 --> 54:38.660
There's not.

54:38.660 --> 54:40.180
Why do you need more details than that?

54:41.460 --> 54:43.380
You could try, put some quick lime on them.

54:45.140 --> 54:46.740
That's going to scare them right away.

54:46.740 --> 54:49.300
If you dump a little quick lime right on your pubes,

54:49.300 --> 54:51.940
that's going to keep your dog away.

54:51.940 --> 54:53.460
It's going to keep deers away.

54:53.460 --> 54:53.860
If that's a problem for you.

54:53.860 --> 54:55.460
You could also go with a no-no can.

54:55.460 --> 54:58.020
Just get like a Pepsi can full of small pebbles

54:58.020 --> 54:59.940
and every time he goes to eat the pubic hair,

54:59.940 --> 55:00.820
you shake the no-no can at him.

55:00.820 --> 55:02.420
Yeah, but that means you will have to be there

55:02.900 --> 55:03.700
pretty much constantly.

55:03.700 --> 55:04.580
So you'll have to.

55:04.580 --> 55:05.540
You're going to have to set,

55:05.540 --> 55:06.980
you're going to have to set a honey pot.

55:06.980 --> 55:09.460
And so you're going to have to place pubes there

55:09.460 --> 55:11.060
specifically to draw the dog in.

55:11.060 --> 55:14.580
Or you could hire an attendant to stand over your pubes

55:14.580 --> 55:15.860
that you left in the bathroom.

55:16.660 --> 55:22.660
Tie a can of, tie a long thread of cans

55:22.660 --> 55:24.100
to one of the pubes.

55:24.100 --> 55:26.900
And then when he eats it, then he'll run around

55:26.900 --> 55:28.580
and you'll hear the cans banging around.

55:29.460 --> 55:31.540
That seems like less of a way to get him to stop,

55:31.540 --> 55:32.900
more of a way to know that he's done.

55:32.900 --> 55:34.580
Put the pubes on glue.

55:34.580 --> 55:34.820
Okay.

55:34.820 --> 55:37.140
Okay, and then he'll try to lick it,

55:37.140 --> 55:38.340
but his tongue gets stuck.

55:38.340 --> 55:39.700
And then the more he looks at it.

55:41.540 --> 55:44.020
Hire a bigger dog to protect your pubes.

55:44.020 --> 55:47.220
It would be so much, it would be so much easier

55:47.220 --> 55:49.140
to get your dog to stop doing things

55:49.140 --> 55:52.260
if dogs felt ashamed or embarrassment or anything.

55:52.260 --> 55:54.900
Have you considered building a small house

55:54.900 --> 55:56.500
around your pubes and locking the door?

55:58.500 --> 56:01.300
Or, or get rid of the dog.

56:02.260 --> 56:03.380
Wow, Trout.

56:03.380 --> 56:03.940
Wow, Trout.

56:03.940 --> 56:05.620
I'm just saying, I mean, I know it's drastic,

56:05.620 --> 56:06.420
but it would work.

56:06.420 --> 56:08.740
Cut off his pubes, put them over,

56:09.380 --> 56:11.860
camouflage your own pubes with them.

56:11.860 --> 56:13.220
And then when he sees them, he's like,

56:13.220 --> 56:14.100
oh, no big deal.

56:14.100 --> 56:14.660
It's just mine.

56:15.540 --> 56:17.540
Cut off his pubes and eat them in front of him.

56:17.540 --> 56:18.500
Be like, how's this feel?

56:19.940 --> 56:20.420
How do you like this?

56:20.420 --> 56:22.100
Sounds so nice when it happens to you, is it?

56:22.100 --> 56:25.140
Makes you feel pretty sad to watch me eating your pubes.

56:25.140 --> 56:26.420
I mean, wait a minute.

56:26.420 --> 56:27.620
I love this and I have a boner.

56:27.620 --> 56:28.120
Oh God.

56:28.900 --> 56:31.060
Oh boy.

56:31.060 --> 56:31.940
Oh boy.

56:31.940 --> 56:35.060
Sam back at quantum leap out.

56:35.060 --> 56:36.260
Ziggy, I messed up.

56:36.260 --> 56:36.980
Ziggy, I ate the pubes.

56:36.980 --> 56:38.740
No, and then Dean Stockwell apparates.

56:38.740 --> 56:39.860
Ow, I ate the pubes.

56:39.860 --> 56:40.580
Why haven't I leave?

56:40.580 --> 56:41.540
Dean Stockwell appears.

56:41.540 --> 56:42.900
He's like, nope, that's pretty much,

56:42.900 --> 56:44.500
that's what you needed to do here, actually.

56:44.500 --> 56:45.540
I'm consulting with Ziggy.

56:45.540 --> 56:46.100
This can't be right.

56:46.100 --> 56:48.580
But it said in order to prevent catastrophe,

56:48.580 --> 56:50.580
you had to learn that you like eating pubes.

56:50.580 --> 56:52.980
So if you hadn't eaten those pubes,

56:52.980 --> 56:54.820
Jackie Kennedy would have been shot too.

56:54.820 --> 56:55.300
Yeah.

56:55.300 --> 56:56.020
Think about it.

56:57.140 --> 56:57.700
Think about it.

56:57.700 --> 56:59.060
That doesn't sound right, Al.

56:59.060 --> 57:00.500
Eat more dog pubes, Sam.

57:00.500 --> 57:02.740
Sam, save some pubes for me.

57:03.860 --> 57:07.300
Sam, now I have to go punch Colin McLaughlin in the stomach

57:07.300 --> 57:09.140
because Dennis Hopper told me to.

57:10.260 --> 57:11.300
Blue Velvet again.

57:11.300 --> 57:12.340
Man, great film.

57:14.020 --> 57:16.580
That one scene where Isabella Rossellini gets fucked

57:16.580 --> 57:18.820
by dog pubes is amazing.

57:18.820 --> 57:21.940
It's animated and claymated, which is weird to do both.

57:22.980 --> 57:24.340
What a fun episode.

57:25.620 --> 57:26.260
Do you think?

57:28.020 --> 57:29.540
Tomorrow I'm going to listen to it and wonder

57:29.540 --> 57:32.420
who is that hilarious stranger recording with my brothers

57:33.060 --> 57:34.500
and why did I miss the recording?

57:35.220 --> 57:37.140
So this has been My Brother, My Brother, Me.

57:37.140 --> 57:40.260
It's a psychosexual journey into the unknown,

57:40.260 --> 57:44.260
starring three actual brothers, Justin, Travis, and Griffin McElroy.

57:44.260 --> 57:47.540
Every week we listen to you, your questions,

57:47.540 --> 57:53.140
and we help you rebuild your life from what you've done to it every week.

57:53.140 --> 57:55.060
That we made you do to it the previous week.

57:55.700 --> 57:56.420
We're sorry.

57:56.420 --> 58:00.020
Every week is about undoing the damage we've done.

58:01.060 --> 58:04.340
Twitter, thank you so much for tweeting about our program

58:04.900 --> 58:06.900
using the NBNBA hashtag.

58:06.900 --> 58:09.540
Joel Kelly, C. Duncan Cook, John Gregory,

58:09.540 --> 58:15.460
Santa Proden, Amalaya Shuri, Mark Brown,

58:15.460 --> 58:19.060
Jan Villarosa, Evan Weston, Bramblepelt,

58:19.060 --> 58:24.500
Loretta Zahn, Isaac Zuka, Zix, Sarah, Erin S.

58:24.500 --> 58:26.660
So many people tweeting about our program.

58:26.660 --> 58:28.660
Thank you so, so much for doing so.

58:29.300 --> 58:32.020
If you want to share our site with other people,

58:32.980 --> 58:37.060
our podcast rather, if you want to share our clothing site.

58:37.060 --> 58:41.300
We got an Etsy site if you want to check it out.

58:41.300 --> 58:43.780
It's just some, like we find local stained glass

58:43.780 --> 58:45.460
that's been broken or discarded.

58:46.420 --> 58:51.380
Anyway, so we have a sampler.

58:51.380 --> 58:53.380
It's bit.ly forward slash it's bambambam.

58:53.380 --> 58:55.860
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters

58:55.860 --> 58:58.980
for the use of our theme song, which is called It's a Departure.

58:58.980 --> 59:01.780
You can find it on the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

59:01.780 --> 59:03.780
Whenever I see people like on Twitter talking about

59:03.780 --> 59:06.180
how they just bought this album and how we were right.

59:06.180 --> 59:06.900
And thank you.

59:06.900 --> 59:07.940
And thank you, John Roderick.

59:07.940 --> 59:09.460
And thank you, Long Winters for making it.

59:09.460 --> 59:12.500
I get fucking angry because it's like, why are you?

59:13.620 --> 59:15.540
It's like we've been hanging out at a party

59:15.540 --> 59:16.980
that lasted two and a half years.

59:16.980 --> 59:19.700
And now you're only just bothering to ask what my name is.

59:19.700 --> 59:20.660
You know what I mean?

59:20.660 --> 59:22.740
What I find even funnier is when people ask like,

59:22.740 --> 59:24.340
what is that intro music?

59:24.340 --> 59:27.780
And it's like, we talk about it at the end of every episode.

59:27.780 --> 59:29.220
That's been the show, I guess.

59:30.020 --> 59:35.140
Oh, hey, we're going to be at Max Fun Con, Max Fun Con West

59:36.420 --> 59:40.020
this May and June, end of May or beginning of June.

59:40.020 --> 59:43.380
And I believe last check, there was still a couple beds available.

59:43.380 --> 59:45.940
So head on over to maxfuncon.com.

59:45.940 --> 59:47.380
It's going to be wild.

59:47.380 --> 59:48.020
We're going to be there.

59:48.020 --> 59:50.740
But more importantly, like cool people will too.

59:50.740 --> 59:51.940
So get also.

59:51.940 --> 59:54.020
If you would like to have a personal message

59:54.020 --> 59:55.700
or a business message on the show,

59:55.700 --> 59:59.380
go to maximumfun.org forward slash Jumbotron

59:59.380 --> 01:00:00.660
and they will get you all set up.

01:00:01.620 --> 01:00:03.700
Also, the brothers and I have decided that

01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:05.540
we are ready to do more live shows.

01:00:06.580 --> 01:00:08.500
We're hoping to do one in April,

01:00:08.500 --> 01:00:10.100
but we're just not sure where yet.

01:00:10.100 --> 01:00:15.140
So if you have any suggestions or if you like know any venues

01:00:15.140 --> 01:00:17.220
that will be awesome for us to perform at,

01:00:17.220 --> 01:00:19.940
then let us know and we'll try to get something set up.

01:00:19.940 --> 01:00:23.300
I think we'd really like to do like New England.

01:00:24.180 --> 01:00:26.900
Yeah, New York, Philadelphia, Boston, somewhere around there.

01:00:27.780 --> 01:00:29.380
So if you can make that happen for us,

01:00:30.020 --> 01:00:32.500
if you know of a venue or not just know of a venue,

01:00:32.500 --> 01:00:35.860
but like you know a guy who can get us in.

01:00:35.860 --> 01:00:38.660
He's into the show and you know.

01:00:39.540 --> 01:00:41.620
We need you to grease some palms.

01:00:41.620 --> 01:00:43.700
We need you to be able to grease some wheels for us

01:00:43.700 --> 01:00:44.660
to make this a little easier.

01:00:44.660 --> 01:00:46.420
Grease some wheels and you're going to be greasing.

01:00:47.140 --> 01:00:48.100
Sorry, step one.

01:00:48.100 --> 01:00:50.100
You're going to need to procure a lot of grease.

01:00:50.980 --> 01:00:52.020
That's that's huge.

01:00:52.020 --> 01:00:52.580
It's vital.

01:00:53.460 --> 01:00:55.380
This final Yahoo answer is sent in by Ira Ray.

01:00:55.380 --> 01:00:56.100
Thank you, Ira Ray.

01:00:59.540 --> 01:01:03.620
All right, so Yahoo answers user Mr. Mr. Funeral asks,

01:01:06.100 --> 01:01:08.980
who thinks Bea Arthur should have been buried in a cemetery

01:01:08.980 --> 01:01:10.180
instead of cremated?

01:01:14.740 --> 01:01:16.180
I'm Justin McElroy.

01:01:16.180 --> 01:01:17.140
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:01:17.140 --> 01:01:18.260
I'm Griffin McElroy.

01:01:18.820 --> 01:01:21.060
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

01:01:21.060 --> 01:01:47.620
Kiss your dad's square on the lips.
