WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:51.440
All-stars? I saw the all-stars play. All-stars of baseball? No, all-stars of

00:51.440 --> 00:55.600
chuckles. Chuckle stars? Justin, I'm sorry to interrupt you, but

00:55.600 --> 01:00.880
I know that we're in the middle of this home run. We try to have a good time at the beginning of

01:00.880 --> 01:04.720
the podcast, but I have something really serious to talk about, and I think it's going to affect

01:04.720 --> 01:13.600
everyone pretty strongly. Brace yourselves. The Black Eyed Peas have announced they're taking

01:13.600 --> 01:19.120
a break. What? What? The Black Eyed Peas are breaking up. I mean, I heard the words you said,

01:19.120 --> 01:25.200
but they didn't. Like, something's that terrible. I can't comprehend it with my brain. Yeah,

01:25.200 --> 01:31.680
so we're going to have to say goodbye to Fergie, Will.i.am, etc. Apple the app, please.

01:32.480 --> 01:41.440
Proust was right, you guys. God is dead. I'm not sure that I can. I want to pitch this to you guys

01:41.440 --> 01:47.600
right here and right now. I don't think I can do a podcast today that isn't about this national

01:47.600 --> 01:54.160
tragedy. This is so weird because I'm on Facebook right now, and as you said that to me, simultaneously

01:54.160 --> 02:00.480
all the parties that I was invited to got canceled. That's weird. That's odd. How are they going to

02:00.480 --> 02:08.880
get it started? It looks like every football and hockey game also kaput. I had a beat that I was

02:08.880 --> 02:14.640
holding that I was expecting to drop, and it has not happened. The beat has not dropped,

02:15.440 --> 02:20.240
to my knowledge. I'm still holding in loft. Does Will.i.am have to change his name to Will

02:20.240 --> 02:28.880
he was? I don't know why them breaking up. Will.i.am no more. Would change his status as Will.

02:28.880 --> 02:34.000
Will he is and may again in two to three years after we each proceed. Oh, how dope is that

02:34.000 --> 02:38.880
reunion show going to be? People in the place are going to get down again. It's so fucking sick.

02:40.000 --> 02:43.680
It's going to be ironic by that point, and then it's going to be double good. I just really wish

02:43.680 --> 02:48.160
I could have been there at the meeting when Fergie was like, I think we should break up so I can

02:48.160 --> 02:53.040
pursue some other things. And Will.i.am was like, yeah, me too. You know, my solo career started

02:53.040 --> 02:56.960
in the other guys like, yeah, we're we're working on a lot of big stuff too. I believe you mean

02:56.960 --> 03:02.960
Apple, the app and pogo is the other one. I think it's ghost ghost boy ghost boy.

03:02.960 --> 03:08.880
I think it's ghost ghost dog. The samurai. I think it's I think they just call him Pringles

03:09.440 --> 03:15.440
is his name. Did you go get us some more snacks? That's that is how he developed the moniker

03:15.440 --> 03:18.640
because what else is he fucking doing? Dropping jams? Nope. That's what I am.

03:19.200 --> 03:21.360
He and his pants on stage. No, that's the other one.

03:22.480 --> 03:28.720
Transmorphing into Ferguson for the first time at all. No. She has a lock on that market.

03:28.720 --> 03:32.640
My brother, my brother and me. It's an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother,

03:33.200 --> 03:37.440
Justin McElroy. I'm your middle brother, Travis McElroy. And I'm Griffin McElroy,

03:37.440 --> 03:42.080
the youngest brother of them. We're all three pretty heartbroken.

03:42.080 --> 03:52.080
And I don't know how we can go on. I am actually sitting here having trouble imagining a fabric

03:52.080 --> 03:57.840
of our universe where the black eyed peas have not permeated every inch of it.

03:57.840 --> 04:02.800
Who's got the cocaine habit, you think? Who's really who's? Oh, probably Pringles.

04:02.800 --> 04:06.720
Probably Pringles. Yeah, you're probably right. That was probably a dumb. He's just

04:06.720 --> 04:11.120
snorting cheese. I mean, when everybody thinks of the black eyed peas, they always think of that

04:11.120 --> 04:19.040
guy's boundless energy. Let's be honest, though. If it was him, the announcement wouldn't be,

04:19.040 --> 04:24.320
we're taking a break. The announcement would be, bye, Pringles. Pringles out the van.

04:24.320 --> 04:28.880
Stand by for a Pringles too. We're really going to miss you. Or maybe we'll replace it,

04:28.880 --> 04:33.440
but no one will notice. This is an advice show for the modern era where we take your questions

04:33.440 --> 04:37.120
and turn them into wisdom. Let's get right into it. Well, I mean, I think actually,

04:37.120 --> 04:42.320
I think the window forgetting about six minutes into it. Let's get currently into it. My first

04:42.320 --> 04:53.600
child is due on July 12th. Oops. I am in search of the perfect phrase to welcome my son into the

04:53.600 --> 05:00.400
world. How about sorry, I'm six days late. Happy belated life that you have now. You're welcome.

05:00.400 --> 05:07.920
I'm sorry I haven't spoken to you for a week, my newborn son. Well, I mean, welcome to Earth.

05:07.920 --> 05:12.640
Oh, yeah. I mean, that's it. But can we do a runner up so that we can keep this question going?

05:14.800 --> 05:18.480
Well, that song that sounds specific says you have to be carefully taught to hate and fear,

05:18.480 --> 05:23.280
so you should probably get cracking on that. Oh, yeah. Yeah. You got to tell them which

05:23.280 --> 05:30.320
groups he needs to be afraid of and loathe for their, you know, how they, you know,

05:30.320 --> 05:36.640
butter side up and butter side down, skin color. Is get a job too direct? Get a job, baby.

05:37.920 --> 05:47.200
How lucky is this? No, this isn't even luck. It's sad. This child is the last of the Black Eyed

05:47.200 --> 05:54.880
Peas generation. Sort of like how John Lennon died a month to the day after I was born.

05:54.880 --> 05:59.440
This is similar, don't you think? I think this is worse. It's basically exactly the same.

05:59.440 --> 06:06.080
This is worse? I would rather every beetle be killed. That's true, because John Lennon died.

06:06.080 --> 06:12.080
It was just John Lennon dying with the Black Eyed Peas dying. Go look at Dr. Pepper sponsorships.

06:13.280 --> 06:16.640
Music is dead. Do you remember the day the music died? I did. I was listening to

06:16.640 --> 06:19.840
My Brother, My Brother and Me, and they announced that the Black Eyed Peas split up.

06:21.200 --> 06:26.160
Are we breaking the story? Yeah, this is it. Oh, God. I'm sorry that your baby's first My

06:26.160 --> 06:31.280
Brother, My Brother and Me, and I assume they're listening. Has to be such a downer,

06:31.280 --> 06:38.880
such a downtrodden, broken hearted podcast. What else can expecting in Seattle say to welcome the

06:38.880 --> 06:49.520
child to the world? What about Hakuna Matata? That's a good one. Parents love that shit.

06:50.640 --> 06:56.160
You could decry him for his tardiness if he's late. Be like, what took you so long? Did you

06:56.160 --> 07:02.640
get lost in the urethra? I still, why the fuck every time we talk about childbirth do I think

07:02.640 --> 07:07.680
the urethra is a necessary component in that mix? At least you're correcting yourself.

07:07.680 --> 07:12.560
You could be straight up with him and to to avoid like any surprises for him and just say, hey,

07:13.200 --> 07:17.920
I hope you're prepared to not be cool for like the next 18 years. Yeah, you're going to turn

07:17.920 --> 07:22.720
it around, though. Yeah, at 18, you're going to enjoy your baby. But first, can you can you say

07:22.720 --> 07:29.360
do something funny? Do a trick. Do a trick. You could start prepping him for toddlers and tiaras

07:29.360 --> 07:35.200
like right off the bat. You will be named Brock and he will be fabulous. Now start pumping iron.

07:35.200 --> 07:43.440
Start pumping iron. You will be the strongest baby. What about, hey, baby, thanks for ruining

07:43.440 --> 07:52.000
one of my favorite spots. This is good because because you later you will regret not having

07:52.000 --> 07:56.640
said it to him back before he could comprehend speech. You can't say to him when he's seven.

07:56.640 --> 08:01.120
That's going to jack his scene, but at least you'll get it off your chest. Hey, baby, you ruined-

08:01.120 --> 08:06.960
That was like my vacation destination. And you you have done muddy those waters and now I can't

08:06.960 --> 08:12.400
can't go back. You can never go back. You know, a lot of women literally do muddy the waters.

08:12.400 --> 08:17.200
It's not a lot of people don't talk about it. It's pretty embarrassing. But they listen to muddy

08:17.200 --> 08:22.400
waters, but they are in choppers. Yeah, sure. That's what I'm going with.

08:23.440 --> 08:28.480
Yeah, that's probably best. Just cover your ears and scream and make the pain go away.

08:28.480 --> 08:35.200
There's got to be something good in there, right? Maybe just play this episode for him.

08:37.600 --> 08:40.720
I bet at least one of the things is a thing he could say to a baby.

08:41.840 --> 08:47.760
How about, can you say, get that placenta off of you and we'll talk? Like, look at yourself.

08:47.760 --> 08:54.480
Look at yourself right now. You're a fucking joke. What are you? I love you so much.

08:54.480 --> 08:58.880
You changed my life. You're all you're my whole life now. But seriously, get that

08:58.880 --> 09:02.400
playlist. I can't touch you. Covered and put that. What is that even?

09:03.440 --> 09:06.400
Baby, thanks to you, I understand so many more Creed songs.

09:08.960 --> 09:14.720
Thank you, baby, for this insight. Can you just gently sing to him, arms wide open,

09:14.720 --> 09:18.160
when he comes out? And make sure you're doing your Scott Sapp impression.

09:18.160 --> 09:19.600
Now, Travis, what would that sound like?

09:19.600 --> 09:25.600
Travis, what would that sound like? Well, I just heard the news today.

09:27.440 --> 09:29.760
You sound like a drunk, sleepy Neil Diamond.

09:31.200 --> 09:35.760
You sound like a man who's having infrequent, periodic, painful bowel movements.

09:35.760 --> 09:37.520
When was the last time you heard Scott Sapp?

09:38.320 --> 09:43.760
That's not funny. Scott Sapp has terrible IBS. You shouldn't check that out.

09:43.760 --> 09:45.680
Scott Sapp has terrible everything.

09:45.680 --> 09:48.160
Did you hear the Black Eyed Peas are going back on a tour? Yeah,

09:48.160 --> 09:52.000
they replaced Pringles with Scott Sapp. It's a really weird fit.

09:52.560 --> 09:57.840
What's the appropriate polite response when a friend of a friend asks, Have we met before?

09:57.840 --> 10:01.840
When you know for a fact that you have. You don't want to embarrass them by recounting

10:01.840 --> 10:06.240
the details of your first introduction, but you don't want to seem like you've

10:06.240 --> 10:11.280
never registered them either. Meet up in Manhattan is who that's from.

10:11.280 --> 10:16.000
Why don't why don't you want to do that second thing? Like if they're not if they're not bringing

10:16.000 --> 10:22.640
the effort to register you and their memory banks in their friend database, then like what's wrong

10:22.640 --> 10:30.560
with you also acting like that? I see. I completely disagree. I don't think you could be more off base

10:30.560 --> 10:37.680
here, Griffin. I personally believe that if you've got the opportunity to embarrass someone, yes,

10:38.320 --> 10:42.960
to get the upper hand. Yeah, sure. It's all about power plays. Yeah. Make the power play like,

10:42.960 --> 10:46.400
oh, yeah, of course, we did this and this and I bought you that drink and you loved it. We

10:46.400 --> 10:50.960
laughed about. I agree. And here's why if they have the balls to ask the question,

10:50.960 --> 10:56.800
have we met before that? I think that's in the same category of you don't remember me. Do you

10:56.800 --> 11:02.960
like have we met before that one? Have we met before implies like I can't be bothered to try

11:02.960 --> 11:08.080
to remember you. So you just tell me how I know you like it's putting you in the awkward position

11:08.080 --> 11:12.880
of having to confirm or deny. Because what if the answer was no? It's like, no, you don't know me.

11:12.880 --> 11:17.440
And now this is weird. Like, who asked that question? Can you for it? Can you further

11:17.440 --> 11:22.480
busted out, flip it and reverse it and just be like, yeah, we fucked and then see what they do.

11:23.360 --> 11:28.640
Yeah, this is but I'm like a sixty five year old dude. And it's like, I know. I know. That's why

11:28.640 --> 11:33.760
it was so tender and real. We started for like six months. This is our daughter, Tobago.

11:33.760 --> 11:40.960
Yeah. Why don't you remember her? She has your eyes and your way with words.

11:42.640 --> 11:46.800
When she was born, I told her, welcome to Earth. And I told her tenderly about the

11:46.800 --> 11:52.000
black eyed bees break up and look at her. She still has screaming and screaming sense.

11:54.320 --> 12:01.200
Can we all just be cool? Yeah. Can we just chill out? Like, I'm so I can't joke about this question

12:01.200 --> 12:07.200
because I do this constantly because I forget every person that is not related to me or I don't

12:07.200 --> 12:12.560
live with. Like, if I don't see your face like two to three hours every day, you're gone from my

12:12.560 --> 12:20.560
brain because I got I got so little space up there and I have to save it for like the Pokedex and

12:20.560 --> 12:27.760
like Everclear song lyrics. So I don't think the problem is not remembering. I think it's

12:27.760 --> 12:31.440
asking the question. Like, I don't care if you don't. Yeah, but it bothers me because I

12:32.320 --> 12:37.040
have enough flash memory up there that I can kind of remember like how a nose and a mouth

12:37.040 --> 12:42.080
go together. It's like, hey, buddy, a lot. And you're like, hey, man, what's going on?

12:42.080 --> 12:45.840
Oh, that's so disingenuous. I want to know because maybe I will live with that person.

12:46.960 --> 12:50.960
You might want to live with them. So I might maybe you don't rule it out. I

12:50.960 --> 12:57.280
I this is one of those do as we say, not as we do type situations, because

12:58.240 --> 13:05.200
if you can remember someone's name, that's that's a huge in with them. That's always like the best,

13:05.200 --> 13:10.880
the best thing you can do. If you learn how to do that, let me know. It helps to use it a lot.

13:10.880 --> 13:16.320
That's everybody's, you know, Dale Carnegie says that everybody's favorite sound in any language

13:16.320 --> 13:21.680
is the sound of their own name being said. And and so if you use it a lot in conversation,

13:21.680 --> 13:24.960
then, A, they're going to like it. B, you're going to remember it next time.

13:24.960 --> 13:28.480
You're going to have to bring some new Carnegie to the table because we already dropped that

13:28.480 --> 13:33.520
shit on him with that Jeffrey bit. Remember our Jeffrey Goof? That was a hundred years ago. We

13:33.520 --> 13:39.120
done Carnegie. That one out. That was over a year over one calendar year ago. I know if if

13:39.120 --> 13:45.280
pearls of wisdom go out of style, then this is a reboot. We're rebooting this franchise. This is

13:45.280 --> 13:51.040
a relaunch. This isn't Dale Carnegie. This is the Dale Carnegie. This is the sequel, the revamp.

13:51.760 --> 13:54.160
Dale Carnegie Jr. The race car driver.

13:57.840 --> 14:03.760
So, yeah, I try to just try to match their level wherever they're whatever level of remembrance

14:03.760 --> 14:07.360
they're at. That's what's going to make them most comfortable. And I know it's dishonest,

14:07.360 --> 14:12.400
but hi. Welcome to all social interaction ever, ever, ever. Yep. Because if you're we're all

14:12.400 --> 14:15.680
being honest, here's how that conversation would go. I don't give a shit about you. I don't give

14:15.680 --> 14:20.240
a shit about you either. I clearly didn't care enough to register the first time. I do not know

14:20.240 --> 14:25.280
your name. But again, I do not know your name. But here is the chorus to Father of Mind by Everclear.

14:25.840 --> 14:28.320
Will that do? Do you want to hear that? I've got that for you.

14:29.440 --> 14:32.960
Here is every first generation Pokémon. Are we OK?

14:35.440 --> 14:39.520
I made this first generation Pokémon list for you. Oh, I told you that the first time we met?

14:39.520 --> 14:46.080
Well, this is embarrassing. Well, shit. That's kind of my A material. How do you remember that?

14:46.080 --> 14:53.680
But you don't remember my name. I got to be honest with you guys. I want to keep the lulls coming

14:53.680 --> 14:58.480
because I I think we're in some fertile ground here. But while we were sitting there talking,

14:58.480 --> 15:06.880
my ankle inched its way up my chair and accident like I was kind of playing with a stick on my

15:06.880 --> 15:10.880
chair and not knowing what it was. And it was the button that makes me fall out of the chair like a

15:10.880 --> 15:17.200
child. So if you heard a noise that sounded like an overweight gentleman falling out of a chair and

15:17.200 --> 15:22.320
then trying to cover it up, that's basically you basically assessed. And then if you heard a sad

15:22.320 --> 15:27.680
trombone, that was me editing in a sad trombone to go along with Justin's comical folly.

15:27.680 --> 15:34.160
There's no way he remembered to do that. But maybe you can all imagine it. Griffin. Yeah,

15:34.160 --> 15:39.920
I got you. This one was sent in by Dan Devine, or possibly Dan Devine. I'm going to go with the

15:39.920 --> 15:46.880
latter one because nobody's named Dan Devine. It's my occupant user, Abby Kate, who asks,

15:46.880 --> 15:54.080
it's Pringle's real name, who asks, What do you love the feeling of next to your skin?

15:54.960 --> 16:00.160
And then in the body of the question, she has put in a smiley face emoticon, which isn't

16:00.160 --> 16:04.960
particularly helpful. But okay, wait, read the question one more time. What do you love the

16:04.960 --> 16:13.760
feeling of next to your skin? Uh huh. So she's saying besides your skin, adjacent skin adjacent.

16:14.560 --> 16:18.800
She's not saying other than the feeling of your skin, what feeling do you love? There are three

16:18.800 --> 16:24.560
different ways you can mean this one. Is it is there something hovering centimeters away from

16:24.560 --> 16:29.520
your skin, and you just know what you feel it's ghost pressure, you can feel it. Uh huh. Two,

16:29.520 --> 16:35.520
two, you love your skin the best. That's the best feeling is your skin on your muscles and stuff.

16:35.520 --> 16:40.960
But what what's after that? What's the what's the runner up? What's second nowhere I would want my

16:40.960 --> 16:48.400
skin to be other than around my muscles? Yes. And three is I believe what she is asking is what you

16:48.400 --> 16:55.920
like to touch? What do I like to touch? What do you touch? Creepy question. What a really innocuously

16:55.920 --> 17:01.600
weird. You know what I like to feel? I like the feeling. What do you like on you? What do you know

17:01.600 --> 17:08.400
what I like on me? I like the feeling of the sort of material they use in playgrounds now instead of

17:08.400 --> 17:14.320
gravel. Yeah. You know what I mean? Spongy shit. Spongy shit. I love that. I'm down with that.

17:14.320 --> 17:20.400
I love that. I love to touch it. Just sit there splayed leg milkshake, maybe three milkshakes

17:20.400 --> 17:26.080
because who knows who I'll meet there and just really feel that stuff. Well, hold on, because

17:26.800 --> 17:30.800
I have a pretty good idea of who you'd meet there. Yeah, well, you never know. You know,

17:30.800 --> 17:37.120
you like to maybe you'll meet, make some new friends. Like, you know, do you mean like the

17:37.120 --> 17:44.000
police? Some friends of all ages. Yeah, sure. You know what I like? Young at heart, maybe. I like

17:44.000 --> 17:51.440
um, I like a good roll of packing tape. Like when you get that, like there's something about the

17:51.440 --> 17:57.440
layers of it that really just gets to me because it's really, it's smooth and it's heavy like a

17:57.440 --> 18:02.240
stone. But then on the sides, it's a little sticky, just a little bit. You know what I like? What's

18:02.240 --> 18:09.520
that Travis? Floam. Okay. Well, where does that even exist in the natural environment anymore?

18:09.520 --> 18:14.480
Uh, well, I don't think it ever existed in the natural environment. Pretty sure they just find

18:14.480 --> 18:21.280
a vein of floam. Yeah. I've got a rich vein of gack over here. You gotta watch out for claim jumpers.

18:24.640 --> 18:31.120
The problem with floam is that they stopped producing it in like 1994. And I'm pretty sure

18:31.120 --> 18:36.640
all the floam in the world is now just like crusty bullshit. So like, I don't think I don't think

18:36.640 --> 18:41.920
anyone's going to be born into this generation and a be able to listen to black eyed peas or

18:41.920 --> 18:48.240
be able to feel natural sticky foam. I'm not saying I don't miss it. Yeah, he's not saying

18:48.240 --> 18:54.000
it's a tragedy. It's a tragedy in one act about how Travis can't feel flow anymore. Um,

18:55.600 --> 18:58.800
I like it at playgrounds when you're sitting on the bench.

19:01.440 --> 19:05.600
I mean, there's some extra room and you're like, I wish someone would come. Yeah,

19:05.600 --> 19:09.680
sure. Take one of these. Yeah, you know, a lot of tactile experiences tied into a play,

19:09.680 --> 19:15.840
a good playground. Maybe too many for me personally. Um, hey, you know what I like?

19:16.480 --> 19:18.000
Tell me. Butterfly kisses.

19:21.280 --> 19:25.520
Cause I, I always kind of thought I never have received any that I know. I mean,

19:25.520 --> 19:30.320
maybe an intention. What? As far as I know, that's the next time we hang out. I'm giving

19:30.320 --> 19:37.920
you butterfly kisses. Oh, I wish it was up to you anymore. Oh, good. You know how we're always

19:37.920 --> 19:42.640
trying to find things to replace business handshakes with butterfly kisses? Oh my God.

19:42.640 --> 19:47.200
Yes, I think it doesn't have to be on the face. It could be like on the back of the,

19:47.200 --> 19:52.720
it's gotta be on the cheek and it's gotta be after bedtime prayers. Uh, Griffin,

19:52.720 --> 19:57.840
are there any answers to this question? And if so, can you read them in like sort of a low guttural

19:57.840 --> 20:11.600
moan, feathers, my girlfriend's skin. Oh, like the outside of it. I hope dog

20:14.160 --> 20:23.200
and no one likes feathers, sharp and shitty pirates and cowboys. He, he, he, what? What?

20:23.200 --> 20:27.120
You like the feeling of pirates on your skin, Griffin? I feel like you didn't sell that one.

20:27.120 --> 20:37.440
Can you try again? Pirates and cowboys. That's way better. Hello, Abby. I like being in the garden

20:37.440 --> 20:41.680
and feeling a cool afternoon breeze against the skin after some physical work.

20:44.560 --> 20:52.480
The sun. It's so hot. I'm burning on the sun. Why do I like this? Why am I touching this with my skin?

20:52.480 --> 21:03.520
This sucks. I think that velvet pet velvet pet. That was my favorite eighties band.

21:04.720 --> 21:12.560
Um, no joke. Like 99% of these are female skin, lady skin, female, female flesh. Robbie says,

21:12.560 --> 21:16.320
Robbie says female flesh. How does Robbie say that Griffin?

21:16.320 --> 21:24.960
Female flesh. He said from inside a basement from, from handcuffs. It's a high jail basement.

21:24.960 --> 21:33.920
It's a jail basement. I like, I guess like sure. Sure. A female. Here's the thing.

21:34.560 --> 21:39.440
Nice people. Here's, here's what's not going on. Nobody's saying the touch of a woman. They're

21:39.440 --> 21:47.440
saying female flesh, which is not the same thing. Guys. That's like a weird version of that.

21:47.440 --> 21:51.840
It's like, they don't know you're there. You're almost right, but you're not quite there.

21:53.120 --> 21:57.280
Cause you don't need a woman inside that skin. You can just have it. You don't have to have

21:57.280 --> 22:03.200
an active participant. Stop being weird. Everybody you're upsetting. You happy now?

22:03.200 --> 22:10.560
Um, sometimes my friends rely too heavily on quoting TV shows and movies for humorous effect

22:10.560 --> 22:14.080
in lieu of saying things that are uniquely engaged on their own merits. What should I do

22:14.080 --> 22:20.480
when this happens? Ignore it, make up quotes to fit in, change the subject, uh, narratively

22:20.480 --> 22:27.280
nonplussed in the natty. Uh, definitely don't make up quotes. I like making up quotes

22:27.280 --> 22:31.280
from TV shows that don't exist.

22:31.280 --> 22:32.960
Toss me them sugar smacks.

22:39.760 --> 22:44.160
Jerry, I'm getting socked about my shoes. That's Kramer.

22:46.240 --> 22:48.000
From Kramer. Remember?

22:49.120 --> 22:51.360
Oh, you mean the spinoff series Kramer.

22:51.360 --> 22:53.040
Remember Kramer? The Kramer show?

22:53.040 --> 22:54.160
Kramer v. Kramer.

22:54.160 --> 22:57.520
Yes. Remember Kramer v. Kramer?

22:58.880 --> 23:03.360
Um, I don't think you should make up quotes. I said that earlier,

23:03.360 --> 23:04.560
but then I try to make one up.

23:04.560 --> 23:06.480
And it's like really hard to do, right?

23:06.480 --> 23:08.160
Unless it's about sugar smacks.

23:08.160 --> 23:09.280
Unless it's about sugar smacks.

23:09.280 --> 23:11.760
I'm convinced you just said that because you have sugar smacks somewhere in the

23:11.760 --> 23:14.880
room that you're recording in and the rest of us don't have props, Travis.

23:16.320 --> 23:22.720
Yeah. Well, let me try. Let me try. I'll try to make one, uh, with, uh, let me guitar

23:22.720 --> 23:31.280
that half empty diet Pepsi in a chained up kid from the playground.

23:31.280 --> 23:33.920
Don't make me Zune my replica buster sword.

23:36.960 --> 23:40.480
Yeah, I would actually prefer you not Zune your replica buster sword.

23:40.480 --> 23:41.440
It's very dangerous.

23:42.320 --> 23:47.040
It's super dangerous. And you have to get a doctor to come remove it.

23:47.040 --> 23:54.240
I don't think it's inherently wrong to make, uh, jokes based on movies and TV shows and stuff, but

23:55.360 --> 23:58.000
I think you can rely too heavily on it.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.160
Yeah. But is it worth bringing up though?

24:00.160 --> 24:03.120
I mean, dude, when all, when Napoleon dynamite came out,

24:03.120 --> 24:06.320
it was all I could do not to murder every single person I met.

24:07.040 --> 24:12.080
Like everybody was doing Napoleon dynamite impressions and Napoleon dynamite quotes.

24:12.080 --> 24:13.120
And it made me want to kill them.

24:13.120 --> 24:19.200
Um, I, I appreciate what Justin tries to do, which is every, I would say about once a year or so,

24:19.200 --> 24:25.520
he goes through a phase where he tries to bring back, um, catch phrases from, uh,

24:25.520 --> 24:28.640
like an Austin Powers or an Ace Ventura pet detective.

24:30.240 --> 24:32.800
You never know until you guys see if it'll stick.

24:32.800 --> 24:37.840
Are you, are you on that tip now? And if yes, what does it, what does it sound like dumb and dumber?

24:37.840 --> 24:41.600
Or, well, how about, how about to show you? I will do my Napoleon impression.

24:41.600 --> 24:42.560
Oh Jesus.

24:42.560 --> 24:44.400
Okay. No, it's been, it's been long enough.

24:44.400 --> 24:44.720
Okay.

24:45.360 --> 24:49.040
Ziggy Piggy, Ziggy Piggy. What do you think?

24:49.840 --> 24:50.320
It's pretty good.

24:50.320 --> 24:53.120
Pretty good? Well, it depends on how they're doing it.

24:53.120 --> 24:55.760
Like, are you doing it like,

24:55.760 --> 24:57.760
Hey guys, dynamite. That was mine.

24:58.400 --> 24:59.200
I made that.

24:59.200 --> 25:05.600
Are you doing it like all the time, 24 seven and just a little too exuberantly?

25:05.600 --> 25:07.680
Or are they doing it any clever, funny way?

25:07.680 --> 25:11.120
It's like any joke where if you do it well, yeah, it's funny.

25:11.120 --> 25:12.800
If you do it poorly, it's annoying.

25:12.800 --> 25:18.640
You know, you should, you know, you should do is every time they do it, you, um, you cite them.

25:19.360 --> 25:22.880
You just drop a quick citation in there. Like, Oh, as good as it gets like,

25:24.720 --> 25:26.560
I'll make them really cognizant of it.

25:26.560 --> 25:30.640
You don't have to be malicious about it. Like you're not, you're not picking on them or anything,

25:30.640 --> 25:34.800
but I think if you, if you cite it, if you give it a parenthetical citation,

25:34.800 --> 25:41.040
a fucking AP style, that's not right, but they're going to stop doing it.

25:41.040 --> 25:42.480
I think they'll cut back.

25:42.480 --> 25:44.480
At least cut back and probably stop.

25:44.480 --> 25:51.680
I, by the way, if you at home or someone who likes to quote movies to try to, um, or quote things,

25:51.680 --> 25:57.840
the trick is to, uh, take in media that is obscure enough that no one knows you're doing it.

25:57.840 --> 26:00.560
So they just think you're off the wall and really creative.

26:00.560 --> 26:01.440
Or find like,

26:01.440 --> 26:02.640
I've been doing that for years.

26:02.640 --> 26:06.480
Yeah. Find one friend that shares that kind of eclectic taste.

26:06.480 --> 26:09.520
Like I have some friends I can quote mystery science theater 3000 with

26:10.080 --> 26:12.640
and like everybody in the room isn't going to jump on board,

26:12.640 --> 26:15.360
but the two of us have a good laugh and then we move on.

26:15.360 --> 26:17.440
Like that's fine.

26:17.440 --> 26:22.400
I think, uh, the only references that I think are funny are Tennessee Williams references.

26:22.400 --> 26:22.640
Sure.

26:22.640 --> 26:26.560
If someone like, if two guys are fighting and someone says they're bickering,

26:26.560 --> 26:30.080
like Jack Straw and Peter Ocello, I'm going to lose my shit every time.

26:30.080 --> 26:33.760
God, you nailed it. You nailed it with that cat reference.

26:33.760 --> 26:38.800
Have you considered, uh, making a really funny friend and then drinking their funny up and then,

26:38.800 --> 26:42.880
um, like murdering them and then like those jokes are all yours now.

26:42.880 --> 26:44.320
Uh-huh. Like the Highlander.

26:44.320 --> 26:47.280
Like the Highlander, like the Highlander of jokes. It's all in their name.

26:47.280 --> 26:48.640
Like the, like the Ha-lander.

26:48.640 --> 26:49.120
Mm-hmm.

26:49.120 --> 26:50.880
The Ha-ha-lander.

26:50.880 --> 26:51.520
Maybe.

26:51.520 --> 26:52.800
You actually.

26:52.800 --> 26:54.320
The high laughter.

26:54.320 --> 26:57.360
The hilarious and-er.

26:57.360 --> 26:58.160
Two more.

26:58.160 --> 27:07.760
The giggle guilt. I got nothing. I got nothing.

27:07.760 --> 27:09.680
How about the smile-ander? You didn't even.

27:09.680 --> 27:10.880
The smile-ander.

27:10.880 --> 27:15.920
This has been a great goof and some great riffing,

27:15.920 --> 27:19.200
but I, unlike you guys, have bills to pay.

27:19.200 --> 27:32.720
And, uh, in my world, that means a quick trip to the money zone.

27:32.720 --> 27:38.480
Kim, thank you for marrying Hayden on June 18th, 2011.

27:39.360 --> 27:40.560
We really appreciate it.

27:40.560 --> 27:44.560
You did me a big solid there. You bit the bullet and you jumped on the Hayden sword.

27:44.560 --> 27:46.160
You really took one for the team.

27:46.160 --> 27:51.200
We, we all knew that you, somebody had to marry Hayden,

27:51.200 --> 27:56.000
and I'm glad it was a compassionate speech therapist in her second year of law school,

27:56.800 --> 28:00.400
and not, not me, I guess.

28:00.400 --> 28:03.280
Hey Kim, you're a speech therapist who's attending law school.

28:03.280 --> 28:04.800
You're kind of doing a lot of things.

28:06.000 --> 28:06.720
Yeah.

28:06.720 --> 28:08.800
You kind of have a lot of shit on your plate right now.

28:08.800 --> 28:10.800
That's some free advice from us to you.

28:10.800 --> 28:15.920
Um, so, thank you is what Hayden wants to say to Kim for marrying him,

28:15.920 --> 28:17.760
and that's what we say too.

28:17.760 --> 28:22.000
So you guys enjoy your lives together with Sabrina and Roger there in Baltimore,

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
and, um, thank you for marrying each other.

28:24.000 --> 28:28.080
You keep teaching people to talk good and or punishing criminals.

28:28.080 --> 28:29.600
Like Batman.

28:29.600 --> 28:30.400
Hey, Kathy-

28:30.400 --> 28:32.000
Or teaching criminals to talk good.

28:32.000 --> 28:32.500
Correct.

28:33.360 --> 28:36.160
Kathy, thank you.

28:36.160 --> 28:37.920
No, I don't actually have one on this one.

28:37.920 --> 28:40.080
Kathy just wants to wish her boyfriend Paul happy birthday.

28:40.080 --> 28:48.720
He's, uh, that he's big, big 3-0 for Paul, who's a computer animator, and apparently good looking.

28:48.720 --> 28:49.220
Ooh.

28:49.760 --> 28:50.240
Uh, yeah.

28:50.240 --> 28:56.160
He got to hug me, and he called it, get this, one of the best experiences of my life.

28:56.880 --> 28:57.680
Of your life?

28:57.680 --> 28:58.880
Of your Justin life?

28:58.880 --> 29:00.560
Of his, of his life.

29:01.680 --> 29:02.180
Uh-huh.

29:02.320 --> 29:05.600
I, I'm sure it's in my top, it's up there.

29:05.600 --> 29:12.480
It's up there, um, but he scuba dives on shipwrecks and hugging me would like tug him to another plane.

29:12.480 --> 29:13.760
It was like some next level shit.

29:15.040 --> 29:18.160
Like seeing, like seeing the Black Eyed Peas in concert.

29:18.160 --> 29:20.400
Oh, ah, it still hurts.

29:20.400 --> 29:21.440
It's too fresh.

29:21.440 --> 29:24.880
His birthday is July 20th, so we want to wish him a happy birthday.

29:24.880 --> 29:28.160
Happy birthday to you, Paul, from your beloved Kathy.

29:28.960 --> 29:34.480
And if you would like to get on our Maximum Fun, my brother, my brother and me, Jumbotron,

29:34.480 --> 29:39.680
you just need to go to maximumfun.org forward slash Jumbotron, right?

29:39.680 --> 29:40.180
Correct.

29:42.400 --> 29:46.480
Uh, and that sound can only mean one thing that Griffin has written,

29:46.480 --> 29:52.080
formally composed a song, uh, about everyone on the Jumbotron today.

29:52.080 --> 29:53.440
Take it away, Griffin.

29:54.800 --> 29:55.840
Well, shit.

29:57.520 --> 29:58.080
Good start.

29:59.280 --> 29:59.780
Let's see.

29:59.780 --> 30:03.140
Got to find those connecting elements that make these jingles so cohesive.

30:03.700 --> 30:06.660
It looks like Kim and Kathy's name is supposed to start with K.

30:06.660 --> 30:25.220
Kimberly, can you teach me how to talk?

30:25.220 --> 30:32.980
Kimberly, can you teach me how to talk?

30:32.980 --> 30:40.140
Kathy, can you teach me how to love?

30:40.140 --> 30:44.880
Everything I need, I get from you.

30:44.880 --> 30:49.060
Everything else, I get from a hug.

30:49.060 --> 30:56.420
But you gotta get a lady with a K name.

30:56.420 --> 31:01.900
Hold on to your lady with a K name.

31:01.900 --> 31:06.220
I'm not saying that these are okay dames.

31:06.220 --> 31:14.940
I'm saying they're top flight ladies with a K name.

31:14.940 --> 31:23.900
I'm sure there's a better connecting thing in there.

31:23.900 --> 31:26.080
No, I think you found the best one.

31:26.080 --> 31:29.420
My boyfriend of two years lives about three hours away.

31:29.420 --> 31:32.780
Seeing each other is difficult and sometimes downright impossible.

31:32.780 --> 31:35.300
I know he wants to move closer, but he still hasn't done it yet.

31:35.300 --> 31:37.460
Our relationship is solid, seriously.

31:37.460 --> 31:40.180
Who wouldn't want to live closer to my baking abilities?

31:40.180 --> 31:42.860
You can all attest to this.

31:42.860 --> 31:47.420
That sounded threatening.

31:47.420 --> 31:49.780
Like a cue, like attest to this here.

31:49.780 --> 31:50.780
We can.

31:50.780 --> 31:51.780
They're great.

31:51.780 --> 31:56.100
Assuming the lady who made us baked goods in Cincinnati, because that was fresh.

31:56.100 --> 31:58.700
Anyway, this was so good.

31:58.700 --> 32:00.860
How do I get him to take that leap?

32:00.860 --> 32:08.220
That's from isolated in Indianapolis.

32:08.220 --> 32:09.220
Bake better.

32:09.220 --> 32:11.780
I guess just keep baking.

32:11.780 --> 32:15.060
If you leave a pie on a windowsill, that'll travel three hours, right?

32:15.060 --> 32:18.340
So you will float off of the ground following the stink stream.

32:18.340 --> 32:23.020
Tex Avery cartoons have taught me anything.

32:23.020 --> 32:26.980
I think Griffin and I are going to be on two opposite sides here.

32:26.980 --> 32:29.700
Moving is such a hassle.

32:29.700 --> 32:33.020
Moving is such like, there's so much involved with it.

32:33.020 --> 32:34.620
I'm not saying that you're not worth it.

32:34.620 --> 32:37.060
I'm not saying that he doesn't want to do it for you.

32:37.060 --> 32:40.380
I'm just saying it seems like the kind of thing you don't really rush and be like, yeah,

32:40.380 --> 32:41.380
why not?

32:41.380 --> 32:43.740
Why not pack up and move your shit?

32:43.740 --> 32:46.240
I'm not joking when I say this.

32:46.240 --> 32:51.540
I would move to be closer to pie.

32:51.540 --> 32:53.300
That reason is good enough.

32:53.300 --> 32:54.300
That's adequate for me.

32:54.300 --> 32:56.260
If the pie is good enough.

32:56.260 --> 32:57.260
You're not joking though.

32:57.260 --> 32:59.900
That's why I'm saying you've got to get your baking scene-

32:59.900 --> 33:02.740
You've got to take it to that next level.

33:02.740 --> 33:03.740
That next level of shit.

33:03.740 --> 33:05.740
Much like the Black Eyed Peas used to be great.

33:05.740 --> 33:06.740
Hey, come on now.

33:06.740 --> 33:07.740
That's too trash.

33:07.740 --> 33:08.740
I had just forgotten.

33:08.740 --> 33:09.740
I know.

33:09.740 --> 33:14.340
That's how, that's the circle I keep living in.

33:14.340 --> 33:18.860
So yeah, it's just like rhubarb, look into like graham cracker crust and just-

33:18.860 --> 33:20.420
Oh, if you're doing cheesecakes, fuck it.

33:20.420 --> 33:21.780
I'll move to live with you.

33:21.780 --> 33:23.220
Can we all just move in with this lady?

33:23.220 --> 33:24.220
Cause she sounds great.

33:24.220 --> 33:25.900
Hey, guess what, boyfriend?

33:25.900 --> 33:26.900
You waited too long.

33:26.900 --> 33:28.700
Oh, you missed your shot.

33:28.700 --> 33:32.700
You always want what you can't have and now we got it.

33:32.700 --> 33:33.700
Huckleberry.

33:33.700 --> 33:34.700
That's our pet.

33:34.700 --> 33:39.700
You should have been her Huckleberry.

33:39.700 --> 33:40.700
Now where are your Huckleberry?

33:40.700 --> 33:42.900
We're up in that pie, loving it.

33:42.900 --> 33:43.900
Seeds?

33:43.900 --> 33:44.900
Don't mind.

33:44.900 --> 33:45.900
Love it.

33:45.900 --> 33:46.900
Crunch.

33:46.900 --> 33:47.900
Pie.

33:47.900 --> 33:48.900
Crusty.

33:48.900 --> 33:49.900
Sweet.

33:49.900 --> 33:50.900
Enjoy.

33:50.900 --> 33:51.900
It's like a Maya Angelou poem.

33:51.900 --> 33:52.900
Possibly E.E. Cummings.

33:52.900 --> 33:53.900
Crusty sweet pie on the window.

33:53.900 --> 33:54.900
Your pie.

33:54.900 --> 33:55.900
I carry it in my mouth.

33:55.900 --> 33:56.900
I don't need punctuation.

33:56.900 --> 33:57.900
I got pie.

33:57.900 --> 33:58.900
Thanks, E.E.

33:58.900 --> 33:59.900
I wish E.E.

33:59.900 --> 34:00.900
Cummings made pies instead of poems.

34:00.900 --> 34:01.900
I know he couldn't enjoy them now, but they're so good.

34:01.900 --> 34:11.620
Some fucked up pies.

34:11.620 --> 34:12.620
You think?

34:12.620 --> 34:13.620
Yeah.

34:13.620 --> 34:14.620
This pie isn't contained.

34:14.620 --> 34:15.620
It's just hot filling.

34:15.620 --> 34:19.900
You just made a pile of hot filling and left it on the table, E.E.

34:19.900 --> 34:23.460
Dude, this is just cherry soup, what you have made.

34:23.460 --> 34:24.460
You did a bad job.

34:24.460 --> 34:26.180
This is just a pan full of cherry stims.

34:26.180 --> 34:29.620
E.E. Cummings, you did a really bad job with this pie.

34:29.620 --> 34:31.140
Here's the thing about this pie though.

34:31.140 --> 34:33.460
It's erudite and inspiring.

34:33.460 --> 34:34.740
I appreciate it.

34:34.740 --> 34:37.940
God, I wish I could have come up in the Harlem Pie Renaissance.

34:37.940 --> 34:41.660
Don't you guys?

34:41.660 --> 34:42.660
Those were some-

34:42.660 --> 34:43.660
It was an exciting time to be alive.

34:43.660 --> 34:45.300
Those were some revolutionary pies.

34:45.300 --> 34:48.740
Go to the back door of the Key Lime Club.

34:48.740 --> 34:53.820
They'll tell you about pies you won't find back in Kansas City.

34:53.820 --> 34:58.780
I'll tell you that.

34:58.780 --> 35:00.540
So I guess what we're saying.

35:00.540 --> 35:01.540
I've gone beyond the-

35:01.540 --> 35:04.060
I think we've gone beyond the point now where we can go back, like we can get back-

35:04.060 --> 35:07.860
Oh fuck, I mean we jumped off of the advice train like half sentence in.

35:07.860 --> 35:11.260
I think, fuck, this sucks.

35:11.260 --> 35:12.260
Get him to.

35:12.260 --> 35:13.260
Just get him to do it.

35:13.260 --> 35:14.260
Just get him to do it.

35:14.260 --> 35:15.260
Just tell him-

35:15.260 --> 35:16.580
Say get the fuck over here.

35:16.580 --> 35:17.580
What-

35:17.580 --> 35:18.580
What-

35:18.580 --> 35:19.580
Here's the great-

35:19.580 --> 35:20.580
Here's a great question.

35:20.580 --> 35:24.380
What is three hours away from Indianapolis and also awesome?

35:24.380 --> 35:25.540
Nothing.

35:25.540 --> 35:30.260
I think you need to find out what it is that's really keeping him from doing it.

35:30.260 --> 35:32.660
Because it may be that he doesn't-

35:32.660 --> 35:35.740
Moving can be pretty scary if you've never done it before.

35:35.740 --> 35:38.540
And if it's a question of scary, you can help him through that.

35:38.540 --> 35:39.540
You think he's-

35:39.540 --> 35:40.540
If it's a question of he's-

35:40.540 --> 35:41.540
I bet he's scared of stock car racing.

35:41.540 --> 35:43.180
Do you think that's his hang up?

35:43.180 --> 35:46.620
No, I don't think he's scared of stock car racing, Griffin.

35:46.620 --> 35:47.620
It's scary.

35:47.620 --> 35:48.620
What about Colts?

35:48.620 --> 35:49.620
Colts.

35:49.620 --> 35:51.020
He might be scared of the Manning family.

35:51.020 --> 35:52.020
The extent of-

35:52.020 --> 35:55.500
No, Travis means literal horses.

35:55.500 --> 35:59.620
Like little tiny horses.

35:59.620 --> 36:01.900
What if they run out in the stock car racing track?

36:01.900 --> 36:03.860
Oh, and then there's just chaos.

36:03.860 --> 36:04.860
That's just-

36:04.860 --> 36:05.860
That's a-

36:05.860 --> 36:06.860
That's a hullabaloo is what that is.

36:06.860 --> 36:08.660
I'm trying to save this relationship.

36:08.660 --> 36:09.660
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

36:09.660 --> 36:10.660
It's over here.

36:10.660 --> 36:11.660
Let's buckle down.

36:11.660 --> 36:13.020
Let's buckle down and really save it.

36:13.020 --> 36:15.020
Listen, look, can you put him on the line?

36:15.020 --> 36:16.820
What are you doing?

36:16.820 --> 36:17.820
She's great.

36:17.820 --> 36:18.820
You know what?

36:18.820 --> 36:23.540
Can I give you a scoop that would help everybody with their fucking decision making?

36:23.540 --> 36:28.100
And we talk about this a lot, but in a hundred years, you'll be dead.

36:28.100 --> 36:29.420
You're wasting your time.

36:29.420 --> 36:33.500
You're wasting your life separated from this person who you love.

36:33.500 --> 36:37.340
And there are moments you can be sharing with them all the time that you're missing out

36:37.340 --> 36:40.400
on for stupid three hours of geography.

36:40.400 --> 36:42.500
I think that's absolutely it.

36:42.500 --> 36:45.060
Missing out on, because you don't want to miss this opportunity because you were too

36:45.060 --> 36:48.660
scared or preoccupied or worried to do it.

36:48.660 --> 36:51.740
Just get off your duff and go do it.

36:51.740 --> 36:54.660
Put your shit in a box and drive there.

36:54.660 --> 36:57.460
I'm going to fucking kill you.

36:57.460 --> 36:58.860
I'm going to kill you.

36:58.860 --> 36:59.860
I'm going to burn down your house tonight.

36:59.860 --> 37:04.980
I will seriously fuck you up if you don't get to Indianapolis this second.

37:04.980 --> 37:05.980
Here's the thing.

37:05.980 --> 37:10.860
If you're still living where you're living, whatever place that is, in a week, we're burning

37:10.860 --> 37:11.860
it down.

37:11.860 --> 37:12.860
How does that sound to you?

37:12.860 --> 37:13.860
We're burning it down.

37:13.860 --> 37:14.860
We're wrecking your whole shop.

37:14.860 --> 37:20.700
We're salting the earth, you lazy bitch.

37:20.700 --> 37:26.380
Get in a car and go get into your life with this woman and stop wasting your time.

37:26.380 --> 37:28.740
And our time, you son of a bitch.

37:28.740 --> 37:29.740
God damn.

37:29.740 --> 37:30.740
Griffin, cleanse my palate.

37:30.740 --> 37:32.380
How about a Yahoo answer?

37:32.380 --> 37:33.380
No, no.

37:33.380 --> 37:35.700
Literally, cleanse his palate.

37:35.700 --> 37:36.700
I don't.

37:36.700 --> 37:37.700
Pringles, cleanse my palate.

37:37.700 --> 37:38.700
Pringles?

37:38.700 --> 37:43.140
Bring me a Jordan almond.

37:43.140 --> 37:45.340
This one was sent in by Tom Burkart.

37:45.340 --> 37:46.340
Thank you, Tom.

37:46.340 --> 37:47.340
It's by Yahoo!

37:47.340 --> 37:54.400
It's a user, Mitchell London, who asks, need an old fashioned term for sex for a novel

37:54.400 --> 37:56.660
based in the late 1800s.

37:56.660 --> 38:02.140
I need a term that could be used back then for something sexual that could end in ing.

38:02.140 --> 38:07.900
Snorkeling, coitusing.

38:07.900 --> 38:11.900
Can we say 23 skadooing it?

38:11.900 --> 38:13.700
I think that's okay.

38:13.700 --> 38:15.980
What about the piggy dance?

38:15.980 --> 38:18.780
Was that a term that was used?

38:18.780 --> 38:19.780
Rumping.

38:19.780 --> 38:20.780
Rumping?

38:20.780 --> 38:21.780
Gross!

38:21.780 --> 38:22.780
Gross!

38:22.780 --> 38:27.700
Sock hopping.

38:27.700 --> 38:29.780
I guess that was like the 50s.

38:29.780 --> 38:31.700
I don't know time well.

38:31.700 --> 38:33.980
Yeah, it's okay.

38:33.980 --> 38:35.980
What decade are we in now?

38:35.980 --> 38:38.300
Theoretically, what decade are we operating in again?

38:38.300 --> 38:43.980
We're in the 21st century, doing something into it.

38:43.980 --> 38:45.460
I mean, like, for this question.

38:45.460 --> 38:46.460
Oh, the decade.

38:46.460 --> 38:47.460
Yeah.

38:47.460 --> 38:49.580
I'm going to say the 1890s.

38:49.580 --> 38:52.220
So that's like gold rush.

38:52.220 --> 38:53.220
Prospecting.

38:53.220 --> 38:57.260
Prospecting is good.

38:57.260 --> 39:00.900
How about fumbling with buttons for 45 minutes?

39:00.900 --> 39:01.900
That's good.

39:01.900 --> 39:02.900
No, that's not ing.

39:02.900 --> 39:03.900
Dammit.

39:03.900 --> 39:04.900
Gatsbying.

39:04.900 --> 39:05.900
Mining.

39:05.900 --> 39:06.900
Pickaxing.

39:06.900 --> 39:07.900
Clean jumping.

39:07.900 --> 39:14.580
I didn't mean to get you guys on a 49ers tear.

39:14.580 --> 39:15.580
Panning for pussy gold.

39:15.580 --> 39:19.780
Is that an option?

39:19.780 --> 39:20.780
Dead wooding.

39:20.780 --> 39:21.780
Dead wooding.

39:21.780 --> 39:24.900
I feel like that's if you do a bad job at it.

39:24.900 --> 39:26.700
Yeah, almost certainly.

39:26.700 --> 39:32.160
The only thing I know about this time period is from Oregon Trail, so I'm going to say

39:32.160 --> 39:34.980
yellow fevering.

39:34.980 --> 39:35.980
Did you see Becky?

39:35.980 --> 39:37.680
I heard she got cholera.

39:37.680 --> 39:39.060
You know she gives cholera too.

39:39.060 --> 39:40.060
What's up?

39:40.060 --> 39:42.100
She loves it.

39:42.100 --> 39:43.100
Snake biting.

39:43.100 --> 39:44.100
Transcominant railroading.

39:44.100 --> 39:45.100
What?

39:45.100 --> 39:46.100
Wow.

39:46.100 --> 39:47.100
Hating orientalings.

39:47.100 --> 39:48.100
What?

39:48.100 --> 39:49.100
Hating orientalings.

39:49.100 --> 39:50.100
Hating orientalings.

39:50.100 --> 39:54.940
You're just picking things from the thing and then saying it.

39:54.940 --> 39:58.260
Like it's not even about sex anymore.

39:58.260 --> 39:59.620
Carpet bagging.

39:59.620 --> 40:00.620
Like what?

40:00.620 --> 40:02.260
Reluctantly releasing your slaves.

40:02.260 --> 40:08.740
Like you can't just say shit from the late 1800s and hope it's sex.

40:08.740 --> 40:11.300
I don't think we should worry because I'm pretty sure most of the things that we're

40:11.300 --> 40:13.100
saying didn't happen in the late 1800s.

40:13.100 --> 40:17.140
That was a very unimportant era.

40:17.140 --> 40:18.140
I mean what was it?

40:18.140 --> 40:19.140
The Constitution?

40:19.140 --> 40:21.580
That happened a long time before that.

40:21.580 --> 40:22.580
TV?

40:22.580 --> 40:24.580
Catch me in 50 years.

40:24.580 --> 40:25.580
Nah.

40:25.580 --> 40:26.580
I don't think that.

40:26.580 --> 40:29.620
Maybe Marconi was getting ramped up to do his thing.

40:29.620 --> 40:34.100
Thanks for nothing Uncle John's Bathroom Reader.

40:34.100 --> 40:38.220
Prepare me for this era, for this call as much as I thought you would.

40:38.220 --> 40:39.220
Let's do another Yahoo.

40:39.220 --> 40:40.220
Yeah.

40:40.220 --> 40:41.220
Okay.

40:41.220 --> 40:42.220
This one was sent in by Kayla Doherty.

40:42.220 --> 40:45.420
This one was sent in by Kayla Doherty.

40:45.420 --> 40:46.420
Thank you Kayla.

40:46.420 --> 40:52.500
Yahoo Answers user Bomb Soldier who asks, when is the appropriate time to give my cat

40:52.500 --> 40:56.740
the talk?

40:56.740 --> 41:01.340
My cat Kate Kate is turning eight years old tomorrow and I've considered talking to her

41:01.340 --> 41:03.040
about sex.

41:03.040 --> 41:04.460
Not sure if she's ready though.

41:04.460 --> 41:07.260
Somebody please help me.

41:07.260 --> 41:11.300
This is another one of those that if you had asked me before we started doing this show

41:11.300 --> 41:15.180
I would have said it was someone on Yahoo Answers being funny.

41:15.180 --> 41:17.220
But now I know too much.

41:17.220 --> 41:18.480
And nothing's funny anymore.

41:18.480 --> 41:23.300
And now I know that someone is really stressing over this somewhere.

41:23.300 --> 41:27.660
I'm sorry I misread that it's somebody please kill me.

41:27.660 --> 41:30.940
Release me from this prison of tears.

41:30.940 --> 41:33.400
Because everyone knows it's ten years old.

41:33.400 --> 41:37.900
Can we not just leave these fucking cats alone for a day?

41:37.900 --> 41:40.220
We already cut off their balls.

41:40.220 --> 41:47.140
No, well, I'm assuming what kind of talk would she need to have with her ball-less cat Travis?

41:47.140 --> 41:49.140
Here's this awesome sex shit you can't do it though.

41:49.140 --> 41:50.140
I'm sorry?

41:50.140 --> 41:51.140
How about the apology talk?

41:51.140 --> 41:53.220
Hey cat, I'm sorry I sewed your vagina shut.

41:53.220 --> 41:55.620
Do you want to know about sex?

41:55.620 --> 41:57.100
Why aren't you listening to me?

41:57.100 --> 41:58.100
Come back.

41:58.100 --> 42:00.900
Why are you just eating and lapping up milk?

42:00.900 --> 42:01.900
Because that's all you do all day.

42:01.900 --> 42:08.340
I'm pretty sure that if this person has a cat that they need to talk to, that they ask

42:08.340 --> 42:13.180
the internet how to talk to about sex, they don't actually know like a whole hell of a

42:13.180 --> 42:17.020
lot about it, right?

42:17.020 --> 42:21.740
You're saying that the next question for this person is, so can you suggest some things

42:21.740 --> 42:23.420
I might say to my cat?

42:23.420 --> 42:25.260
Like how am I explained to it?

42:25.260 --> 42:27.940
When should I have the talk and what should I say?

42:27.940 --> 42:29.900
And what is it that happens exactly?

42:29.900 --> 42:30.900
This is really a case of-

42:30.900 --> 42:32.500
Diagrams please.

42:32.500 --> 42:38.300
This is a case of the blind leading the fucking domesticated animals that don't possess the

42:38.300 --> 42:40.300
capacity for human speech.

42:40.300 --> 42:42.580
You dumb asshole.

42:42.580 --> 42:43.860
You're killing Griffin.

42:43.860 --> 42:45.860
Look what you've done to him.

42:45.860 --> 42:46.860
You've snapped his spirit.

42:46.860 --> 42:50.620
Can we just leave these fucking cats alone for a day?

42:50.620 --> 42:55.220
Like every time I get on the internet, it's like I got my cat drunk.

42:55.220 --> 43:00.900
It's like I put my drunk cat on YouTube and it makes me so fucking angry.

43:00.900 --> 43:03.420
Don't talk to your cat about sex because that's it.

43:03.420 --> 43:08.300
That's the only thing your cat has is that it can just fucking garbage cans all day long.

43:08.300 --> 43:14.060
The rest of its life it has to eat shitty like dry cereal basically and have a fucking

43:14.060 --> 43:16.340
terrible human master.

43:16.340 --> 43:18.020
Just let him fuck all day.

43:18.020 --> 43:21.940
He's always trying to talk to them about the birds and the bees.

43:21.940 --> 43:26.060
You hold it too close when you go to bed at night and it gets weirded out.

43:26.060 --> 43:29.940
Just let him get his dick wet.

43:29.940 --> 43:30.940
I want to put this out there.

43:30.940 --> 43:34.220
I own a cat and I think my cat's great and everything.

43:34.220 --> 43:40.940
Your cat, aside from you feeding it, doesn't give two shits about anything you say to it.

43:40.940 --> 43:44.540
Your cat isn't nearly as about you as you are about your cat.

43:44.540 --> 43:45.540
Here's the thing.

43:45.540 --> 43:52.140
If morning comes and finds you dead on your couch, your cat is going to instantly take

43:52.140 --> 43:58.580
in the situation and start looking through your ratty robe pockets for meat.

43:58.580 --> 44:00.460
That's your cat's relationship with you.

44:00.460 --> 44:01.460
How is that?

44:01.460 --> 44:02.460
How is that working?

44:02.460 --> 44:06.820
How about you don't talk to him about sex and you talk to your mailman about having

44:06.820 --> 44:09.020
sex with you and you move on.

44:09.020 --> 44:13.820
By the way, if you're speaking of, if you're looking for the right time to tell any living

44:13.820 --> 44:21.340
being about how to have sex, I maybe wouldn't wait until five years before it dies.

44:21.340 --> 44:25.020
Maybe shoot for a little bit sooner than that.

44:25.020 --> 44:27.660
This fucking cat is 49 in cat years.

44:27.660 --> 44:28.660
Idiot.

44:28.660 --> 44:32.300
Hey, uh, my boyfriend has a boyfriend.

44:32.300 --> 44:33.500
Now hold on.

44:33.500 --> 44:36.420
I've been dating this guy for almost a year and he's absolutely wonderful.

44:36.420 --> 44:41.380
I even really like his best friend, but the problem is he's more dating his best friend

44:41.380 --> 44:42.380
than me.

44:42.380 --> 44:44.740
They spend more waking hours together.

44:44.740 --> 44:47.680
I usually claim the slinky sleeping ones.

44:47.680 --> 44:51.860
They have so many inside jokes that it's often hard to hang out with just the two of them

44:51.860 --> 44:52.860
together.

44:52.860 --> 44:56.860
And sometimes I feel judged for intruding on their bro time, which happens weekly and

44:56.860 --> 44:59.740
bear in mind they live together.

44:59.740 --> 45:04.460
Am I just jealous of their manly love or is there something weird going on here?

45:04.460 --> 45:05.460
Third wheel.

45:05.460 --> 45:06.460
I'm really sorry about your gay boyfriend.

45:06.460 --> 45:10.260
I had sex with guys so much.

45:10.260 --> 45:13.220
He loves guys so much, uh, that he has sex with them.

45:13.220 --> 45:14.220
No, he's not gay.

45:14.220 --> 45:15.220
It's a, this is a pretty natural.

45:15.220 --> 45:17.300
No, this is what she wants to hear.

45:17.300 --> 45:18.300
Let's just give it to her.

45:18.300 --> 45:19.300
Let's just give her a little treat.

45:19.300 --> 45:20.900
Oh, we've gone from advice to placation.

45:20.900 --> 45:24.180
It's totally weird and freaky and not okay and you're right.

45:24.180 --> 45:25.180
Look behind you.

45:25.180 --> 45:26.180
They're blowing each other.

45:26.180 --> 45:34.100
I never thought you would look, um, I have an easy solution to this, this problem.

45:34.100 --> 45:35.100
Have sex with a friend.

45:35.100 --> 45:36.100
Do it once.

45:36.100 --> 45:37.100
Hey.

45:37.100 --> 45:38.100
That friendship is over.

45:38.100 --> 45:39.100
Hey lady.

45:39.100 --> 45:40.100
Solved.

45:40.100 --> 45:41.100
Don't do that.

45:41.100 --> 45:42.100
Solved.

45:42.100 --> 45:46.820
I don't think, I don't think there's anything wrong with a dude enjoying time with his best

45:46.820 --> 45:52.740
friend, but I think that there's gotta be a balance, you know, where he should probably

45:52.740 --> 45:55.880
like you slightly more than his best friend.

45:55.880 --> 46:02.420
I would really look at your feelings and you need to put this in, in a different perspective.

46:02.420 --> 46:05.260
What you need to figure out is how much it's actually bothering you.

46:05.260 --> 46:09.820
Not he spends a lot of time with his friend and I should be bothered, but think about

46:09.820 --> 46:11.900
what's actually impacting your own personal happiness.

46:11.900 --> 46:14.820
Like is the concept bothering you or is it actually bothering you?

46:14.820 --> 46:15.820
Like, yeah, right.

46:15.820 --> 46:16.820
Are you actually feeling neglected?

46:16.820 --> 46:22.960
Because I think in areas that you're feeling neglected, then, then that's one thing.

46:22.960 --> 46:26.060
And I think that that's something you should really address with him.

46:26.060 --> 46:28.220
Otherwise it's jealousy.

46:28.220 --> 46:34.900
You know, like you're, it's not that you're neglected, he, it's that, um, you know, you,

46:34.900 --> 46:38.580
you feel jealous of the time that his friend gets to spend with him.

46:38.580 --> 46:44.720
And that's not a, that's not super healthy, B, that's not something he's going to guess

46:44.720 --> 46:49.140
because in his mind, if he's not neglecting you, then it probably hasn't occurred to him

46:49.140 --> 46:50.380
that you would be upset at all.

46:50.380 --> 46:51.660
Does that make sense?

46:51.660 --> 46:52.660
I'm going to guess though.

46:52.660 --> 46:58.380
I'm going to infer because they live together that you guys are probably in like your twenties.

46:58.380 --> 47:02.700
It's something that I think as everybody grows older, you spend less and less time with your

47:02.700 --> 47:05.980
friends and more and more time with like your family.

47:05.980 --> 47:08.140
So this isn't going to be a forever problem.

47:08.140 --> 47:14.380
So let him have his time with his friend now and develop this, you know, lifelong friendship.

47:14.380 --> 47:16.900
Because eventually, you know, he's going to have a job and kids and everything and he's

47:16.900 --> 47:19.700
not going to get to hang out with his best friend all the time.

47:19.700 --> 47:24.460
You can't deep six this friendship because it's going to put too much pressure on you.

47:24.460 --> 47:25.460
Trust me.

47:25.460 --> 47:30.300
Most guys are secret needy and you don't want to have to hang out with them all the time.

47:30.300 --> 47:35.940
Play halo with him and like if I can scarf a bunch of four loco and pizza rolls, like

47:35.940 --> 47:37.540
you don't want all that responsibility.

47:37.540 --> 47:38.540
Trust me.

47:38.540 --> 47:42.300
His friend has taken, taken a lot of the load off for you.

47:42.300 --> 47:47.860
Now if you are actually upset about it, you need to have a talk about it, but not in a,

47:47.860 --> 47:51.340
you need to spend more time with me and less time with him, but address the things that

47:51.340 --> 47:52.340
you need.

47:52.340 --> 47:56.020
Like, you know, I think that we should spend more time together.

47:56.020 --> 48:00.740
I miss you, that kind of thing, but don't make it a choice between you and his friend.

48:00.740 --> 48:01.740
Right.

48:01.740 --> 48:02.740
It's not going to end well.

48:02.740 --> 48:03.740
Yeah, exactly.

48:03.740 --> 48:08.260
Don't, don't make him spend more time with you at the expense of spending time with his

48:08.260 --> 48:09.260
friend.

48:09.260 --> 48:13.140
Let him figure out where he's going to make the, the, the requisite cuts.

48:13.140 --> 48:18.700
And, you know, also you, you would also do yourself a big favor if you'd get it out of

48:18.700 --> 48:23.820
your head that you are the third wheel, because I think if you really just ingratiate yourself

48:23.820 --> 48:31.180
in there and, and be cool, then it would, then it would probably help to make you not

48:31.180 --> 48:32.180
feel so isolated.

48:32.180 --> 48:35.140
I don't think she should have to hang out with them when they're trying to touch their

48:35.140 --> 48:36.660
balls together.

48:36.660 --> 48:39.220
I'm not sure that's part of the equation, Griffin.

48:39.220 --> 48:40.220
All right.

48:40.220 --> 48:43.060
Do you mean metaphorically touch their balls together?

48:43.060 --> 48:45.660
I mean spiritually touch their balls together.

48:45.660 --> 48:46.660
Okay.

48:46.660 --> 48:47.660
I'm talking about it.

48:47.660 --> 48:49.860
I don't think she should have to hang out with them every time, but I'm saying when

48:49.860 --> 48:51.240
she feels isolated.

48:51.240 --> 48:52.620
She shouldn't feel uncomfortable hanging out with them.

48:52.620 --> 48:54.420
She shouldn't feel uncomfortable hanging out with them.

48:54.420 --> 48:59.300
And if she, if she feels that way, then that's something she definitely needs to address.

48:59.300 --> 49:04.200
You know, even if it's something as simple as having him sort of explain to you where

49:04.200 --> 49:06.860
these inside jokes came from and stuff like that.

49:06.860 --> 49:07.860
Yeah.

49:07.860 --> 49:10.860
Because he probably doesn't realize that you feel excluded in those moments.

49:10.860 --> 49:11.860
Yeah.

49:11.860 --> 49:15.180
He's probably laughing and having a good time and he's probably not sitting there thinking,

49:15.180 --> 49:17.300
but is she having a good time?

49:17.300 --> 49:18.780
Because he's a, he's a boy.

49:18.780 --> 49:19.780
He's a stupid boy.

49:19.780 --> 49:20.780
He doesn't think that way.

49:20.780 --> 49:21.780
I'm sorry.

49:21.780 --> 49:23.620
His brain doesn't work very well.

49:23.620 --> 49:25.900
Guys, let's stop talking about that.

49:25.900 --> 49:27.980
Um, cause I feel like we, we solved it.

49:27.980 --> 49:29.540
You mean that lady's homo boyfriend?

49:29.540 --> 49:36.000
We solved it so good that let's move on and talk about this month and the things that

49:36.000 --> 49:38.100
are going on that people need to pay attention to.

49:38.100 --> 49:39.100
Cause we didn't do it last week.

49:39.100 --> 49:40.100
Fuck.

49:40.100 --> 49:41.100
Griffin, the month's half over.

49:41.100 --> 49:48.220
Hey, half a month of wisdom about mango and melon month is better than no months of wisdom.

49:48.220 --> 49:51.780
I feel like this point you'd have to choose that it has to be a mango or melon month.

49:51.780 --> 49:52.780
Yeah.

49:52.780 --> 49:54.260
You gotta let go one of them.

49:54.260 --> 49:57.940
Quit trying to have your mango and also eat a melon with it.

49:57.940 --> 49:58.940
Greedy bitch.

49:58.940 --> 49:59.940
Um.

49:59.940 --> 50:02.980
So Griffin, why don't you tell for those who may just be joining us, why don't you tell

50:02.980 --> 50:03.980
about this terrible thing.

50:03.980 --> 50:08.840
Every month shit happens or well no constantly shit is constantly happening.

50:08.840 --> 50:13.700
It's like, um, just like molecules colliding and bad shit happens all the time and people

50:13.700 --> 50:18.320
are getting killed by their baths and by ice cream cones that they ate the wrong way.

50:18.320 --> 50:20.780
And so like we got to warn them.

50:20.780 --> 50:25.940
It's just us on the edge and we're warning people and about shit that happens every month

50:25.940 --> 50:28.840
from a list that I find on the internet.

50:28.840 --> 50:36.220
So we are there every month is a special month, a special day of the collection of 30 special

50:36.220 --> 50:37.220
days.

50:37.220 --> 50:38.220
It's a collection of 30 special days.

50:38.220 --> 50:42.580
So what is, what has July been officially recognized as Griffin?

50:42.580 --> 50:47.660
Well according to this website, which based on the animated GIF background, I think is

50:47.660 --> 50:52.540
a legit operation, um, there's, there's all kinds of flavors we could go with national

50:52.540 --> 50:55.540
dog house repairs month is.

50:55.540 --> 50:56.540
Get out there and fix your face.

50:56.540 --> 50:58.540
Your dog's house is busted.

50:58.540 --> 51:03.540
Uh, uh, uh, national share a sunset with your lover month.

51:03.540 --> 51:04.540
Bleah.

51:04.540 --> 51:05.540
No, I like that.

51:05.540 --> 51:07.720
Put your lover's skin on your skin month.

51:07.720 --> 51:09.120
I like that.

51:09.120 --> 51:13.140
There's national, national wheelchair beautification month, which I do not think we could talk

51:13.140 --> 51:19.380
about without, um, safely saying some kind of goof that would be import taste, import

51:19.380 --> 51:21.780
a sandwich generation month.

51:21.780 --> 51:27.380
Now this I want to know more about because there's one, there's one of two pretty awesome

51:27.380 --> 51:31.540
ways that this month could go right?

51:31.540 --> 51:34.820
One is, one is, well, okay, I can think of three.

51:34.820 --> 51:38.540
The first is I'm making a sandwich, generating a sandwich.

51:38.540 --> 51:39.540
Let's yes.

51:39.540 --> 51:41.260
It's sandwich generation month, everybody.

51:41.260 --> 51:42.820
You know what that means?

51:42.820 --> 51:43.820
Yeah.

51:43.820 --> 51:50.300
The sandwich generation was, it means, it means forget two slices.

51:50.300 --> 51:53.660
This is a new day and the next generation of sandwich.

51:53.660 --> 51:54.660
Yeah.

51:54.660 --> 51:58.060
You're talking about taking it to the next level.

51:58.060 --> 51:59.060
Oh God.

51:59.060 --> 52:05.580
So is this like, like the new revolution in recipes and cooking, like kind of, you know,

52:05.580 --> 52:10.820
there's the micro foods kind of thing or the stuff where like you freeze shit and deconstruct

52:10.820 --> 52:11.820
a hamburger.

52:11.820 --> 52:12.820
Is that what we're talking about?

52:12.820 --> 52:13.820
Yes.

52:13.820 --> 52:18.780
It's like molecular gastronomy, but instead you're just using one slice of bread, bread

52:18.780 --> 52:19.780
sandwich generation.

52:19.780 --> 52:21.900
It's a thought sandwich.

52:21.900 --> 52:24.940
It's sandwich 2.0, free your mind from the second slice.

52:24.940 --> 52:29.580
So it'd be like, I had a piece of bread on Monday and a slice of bologna on Thursday.

52:29.580 --> 52:30.580
Yeah.

52:30.580 --> 52:32.140
Piece of bread on Saturday.

52:32.140 --> 52:35.620
A procedurally generated sandwich.

52:35.620 --> 52:36.620
Procedurally generated sandwich.

52:36.620 --> 52:38.340
Hey, did you have a single down at KFC?

52:38.340 --> 52:39.340
I did.

52:39.340 --> 52:40.340
It sucked.

52:40.340 --> 52:44.060
It was just a piece of bread and I charged, I was charged $4 for it.

52:44.060 --> 52:46.180
This is the next, this is the next sandwich.

52:46.180 --> 52:48.700
So the next sandwich, the sandwich of the future, people are busy.

52:48.700 --> 52:49.740
They don't want to carb up.

52:49.740 --> 52:51.740
What they're doing is they're getting rid of the top slice.

52:51.740 --> 52:58.740
So we can just say, we can say hold the mayo and also the ham and also the lettuce and

52:58.740 --> 52:59.740
the mustard.

52:59.740 --> 53:01.000
No, you're not understanding.

53:01.000 --> 53:03.060
The things are still on the sandwich.

53:03.060 --> 53:07.220
You're talking about an open face sandwich though, and that's not particularly revolutionary.

53:07.220 --> 53:10.940
An open face sandwich is just a sandwich two you haven't folded yet.

53:10.940 --> 53:17.700
And an open face sandwich is also a name for sex in 1990, or in 1898.

53:17.700 --> 53:18.700
Justin.

53:18.700 --> 53:19.700
Yes.

53:19.700 --> 53:23.620
We've been at bread tacos and I don't, I think we skipped over it too quickly.

53:23.620 --> 53:26.220
No, you're, yes, bread tacos.

53:26.220 --> 53:33.100
What about, what about like nine steps into the future, like 3011, you just think about

53:33.100 --> 53:34.100
a sandwich.

53:34.100 --> 53:37.000
You just, you just listen to the black eyed peas.

53:37.000 --> 53:38.000
They're back together.

53:38.000 --> 53:39.000
And you think about a sandwich.

53:39.000 --> 53:43.460
Travis, by that fucking point, no sandwich passes betwixt your lips.

53:43.460 --> 53:46.860
We're going to have matrix ethernet ports in the back of our brains and we can just

53:46.860 --> 53:49.060
download a sandwich thought.

53:49.060 --> 53:50.060
You can just download a sandwich.

53:50.060 --> 53:54.340
You can download a flavor taste direct from subway.

53:54.340 --> 53:55.340
It's called a $5 gigabyte.

53:55.340 --> 53:56.340
I wish.

53:56.340 --> 53:57.340
The byte is spelled B-I-T-E.

53:57.340 --> 54:04.300
And then by dollar, he means five billion dollars.

54:04.300 --> 54:06.900
Five billion space credits.

54:06.900 --> 54:08.660
At that point, it'll be like five babies.

54:08.660 --> 54:09.660
Yeah, sure.

54:09.660 --> 54:12.860
Cause we'll all be, um, baby factories?

54:12.860 --> 54:13.860
What are you saying?

54:13.860 --> 54:14.860
We'll be trading in babies.

54:14.860 --> 54:15.860
Sandwich shop.

54:15.860 --> 54:18.380
It's all in, it's in my, my new novel.

54:18.380 --> 54:23.340
Am I the only one who went to like the Pepsi generation?

54:23.340 --> 54:31.900
Like everybody who is currently ages, let's say 15, how about this newborn baby?

54:31.900 --> 54:32.900
This newborn baby.

54:32.900 --> 54:36.340
It starts at the end of the black eyed peas generation.

54:36.340 --> 54:37.340
Yeah.

54:37.340 --> 54:41.260
Because black eyed peas generation, sandwich generation, Skechers generation.

54:41.260 --> 54:45.300
We haven't reached that one yet, but guys put some money, drop some money on your Skechers

54:45.300 --> 54:46.440
stocks.

54:46.440 --> 54:53.860
So wait, X generation, X generation Y, X, Y, Z, Alpha, Beta, Theta, Zeta, Pepsi, black

54:53.860 --> 54:56.620
eyed peas, sandwich, Skechers.

54:56.620 --> 54:57.620
Okay.

54:57.620 --> 54:59.300
I think I'm, I'm on board.

54:59.300 --> 55:02.140
So welcome babies of the future to the sandwich generation.

55:02.140 --> 55:04.420
I'm curious though, just real quick.

55:04.420 --> 55:08.700
Are there any obligations of being in the sandwich generation?

55:08.700 --> 55:14.540
You um, the, you're drafted into the military just instantly.

55:14.540 --> 55:17.940
That's right, like straight out the gate from the jump.

55:17.940 --> 55:24.060
You are in the military, but you get all the sandwiches that you need and crave.

55:24.060 --> 55:25.060
Like forever.

55:25.060 --> 55:26.060
Forever.

55:26.060 --> 55:27.060
Yeah.

55:27.060 --> 55:28.060
That's the new social security.

55:28.060 --> 55:30.700
Instead of getting any social security card, you get a subway punch card.

55:30.700 --> 55:34.980
I really wish it's already filled out.

55:34.980 --> 55:35.980
Yep.

55:35.980 --> 55:36.980
Yeah.

55:36.980 --> 55:37.980
It's like, what's your social security number?

55:37.980 --> 55:38.980
Eight punches, two more.

55:38.980 --> 55:39.980
And I get a BLT.

55:39.980 --> 55:40.980
So got that.

55:40.980 --> 55:42.740
There were more wars.

55:42.740 --> 55:44.740
I have only fought eight of them.

55:44.740 --> 55:49.020
When I fight in that 10th war, I'll never pay for a sandwich again.

55:49.020 --> 55:51.540
Unfortunately all sandwiches are downloaded through brain ports.

55:51.540 --> 55:52.540
I miss eating.

55:52.540 --> 55:53.700
I hate the future.

55:53.700 --> 55:55.620
I have mustard in my brain port.

55:55.620 --> 55:56.660
I tried, did it wrong.

55:56.660 --> 55:57.660
I didn't download it.

55:57.660 --> 55:58.660
I just wanted a mustard on it.

55:58.660 --> 56:00.940
I just put the, got mustard on my mind now.

56:00.940 --> 56:04.740
I see the silly lighthearted bucks walking around their Skechers and I think what could

56:04.740 --> 56:05.740
have been.

56:05.740 --> 56:08.140
I think you youngsters today with their Skechers.

56:08.140 --> 56:11.900
You youngsters today, you don't understand the service that I provided this country.

56:11.900 --> 56:14.580
I earned these sandwiches.

56:14.580 --> 56:15.580
Killed so many.

56:15.580 --> 56:16.580
They're gonna be a baby lol.

56:16.580 --> 56:18.060
Killed so many Martians.

56:18.060 --> 56:24.580
Nine months from today where parties aren't rocking anymore and the black, cause the black

56:24.580 --> 56:26.620
IPs aren't making the beat drop there.

56:26.620 --> 56:30.180
So how are babies going to get born without that boom, boom, pow?

56:30.180 --> 56:33.020
Is my question.

56:33.020 --> 56:34.500
Think about it.

56:34.500 --> 56:38.220
The human race might, do they have to get back together at that point if we see like

56:38.220 --> 56:39.220
a dramatic down.

56:39.220 --> 56:41.220
When like the sun stops providing heat.

56:41.220 --> 56:45.700
I feel like this is the setup for like a Bill and Ted's excellent adventure style movie

56:45.700 --> 56:49.900
where Rufus has to travel back in time and make sure the black eyed peas get back together.

56:49.900 --> 56:50.900
Yeah.

56:50.900 --> 56:51.900
Good job.

56:51.900 --> 56:52.900
Good job, America.

56:52.900 --> 56:53.900
I'm saying.

56:53.900 --> 56:54.900
He's where our wire stallions and we let them go.

56:54.900 --> 56:56.820
I say things are way more dire than that.

56:56.820 --> 57:02.420
I'm saying, you know how, um, you know how like when there's a flood or a tidal wave,

57:02.420 --> 57:06.100
like mice and dogs and cats will like run away from it.

57:06.100 --> 57:10.960
I'm saying that the black eyed peas know that like the heat death of the universe is coming.

57:10.960 --> 57:14.060
And so they, they, they have broken up because they're leaving.

57:14.060 --> 57:15.540
They're leaving this planet.

57:15.540 --> 57:23.980
Oh, so by the them breaking up a typhoon in Japan is a vert, like the butterfly effect,

57:23.980 --> 57:24.980
right?

57:24.980 --> 57:25.980
Is that what you're saying?

57:25.980 --> 57:26.980
Like the apple, the app effect?

57:26.980 --> 57:32.460
I'm saying that read the book of revelations cause this is fucking verse one, chapter one,

57:32.460 --> 57:36.260
the four horsemen of the beat of the funk ellipse.

57:36.260 --> 57:37.260
Uh huh.

57:37.260 --> 57:38.460
I miss them so guys.

57:38.460 --> 57:40.460
I'll miss, I'll miss them so much.

57:40.460 --> 57:45.580
Hey, can all of our listeners, um, get off your asses and write a letter.

57:45.580 --> 57:46.580
I don't know to your representative.

57:46.580 --> 57:47.580
Is there a petition?

57:47.580 --> 57:48.580
Congressman.

57:48.580 --> 57:50.940
There ought to be a law.

57:50.940 --> 57:51.940
There ought to be a law.

57:51.940 --> 57:54.860
Get a law in the book.

57:54.860 --> 57:55.860
You know what we should have done.

57:55.860 --> 58:00.020
Hey, if they aren't going to be the black eyed peas, somebody else needs to.

58:00.020 --> 58:01.980
It should be a title that's handed down.

58:01.980 --> 58:03.140
It's exactly.

58:03.140 --> 58:05.700
It should be like the dry pirate Fergie.

58:05.700 --> 58:11.580
You know, this was all, we can't be angry at the black eyed peas.

58:11.580 --> 58:13.020
This is all bad planning on our part.

58:13.020 --> 58:18.340
What we should have done is we should have taken 10 to 20% of every black eyed peas album

58:18.340 --> 58:23.180
that came out and held it into a strategic black eyed peas reserve so that we could keep

58:23.180 --> 58:24.740
the black eyed peas train rolling.

58:24.740 --> 58:27.020
Um, sort of social security style.

58:27.020 --> 58:32.300
Instead, we're in a double dip black eyed peas recession and everyone's feeling it.

58:32.300 --> 58:35.140
The black eyed peas balloon, the bubble has burst.

58:35.140 --> 58:37.620
Oh God.

58:37.620 --> 58:38.620
This is my black.

58:38.620 --> 58:40.700
This is my black eyed peas lock box.

58:40.700 --> 58:44.500
So it's like body odor, Dr. Pepper in here.

58:44.500 --> 58:45.860
Why is there so many black eyed peas?

58:45.860 --> 58:49.500
Hey, listen, I want to hear Griffin's last question, but first thank you so much for

58:49.500 --> 58:54.100

It was a fun little project.

59:14.140 --> 59:20.260
And that Travis came up with that I thought was a real thing, but I guess it's better.

59:20.260 --> 59:22.620
I made it a real thing by my actions.

59:22.620 --> 59:24.900
Yeah, sure.

59:24.900 --> 59:29.980
Sam Barsanti has listened to 27 NBNB AM episodes in the past two weeks.

Um, so that way you get them automatically each week and you don't even have to think
