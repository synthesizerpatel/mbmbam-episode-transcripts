00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:45.040
It's a new craze, and good girls do you wanna just say, hey, I wanna, just say, hey, I wanna.

00:45.040 --> 00:49.280
Welcome to my brother, my brother, mean advice show for the modular. I'm your oldest brother,

00:49.280 --> 01:04.560
Justin Tyler McElroy. I'm your middle brother, Travis Patrick McElroy. You'll get him next time,

01:04.560 --> 01:11.520
champ. I'm hometown boy made good in 30 under 30 media luminary, Griffin McElroy.

01:11.520 --> 01:20.960
I kind of thought I was gonna win. We love coming to Texas.

01:22.480 --> 01:27.360
And playing fucking candy crush while we're doing it. Austin has, it almost feels like home to us

01:27.360 --> 01:32.000
now because we've played here so many times. It's like a home to us, like a second home.

01:32.000 --> 01:37.360
Austin's like a second home. It's like coming home for me. It's almost like we own property here

01:37.360 --> 01:44.160
and all of our shit is here. That's what it feels like. You know, you come, you see old friends,

01:44.160 --> 01:51.360
old family, old lovers. I thought it would be better. Old lovers, I actually would love to

01:51.360 --> 01:59.520
explore. That's tough. I've had a lot of old lovers. We saw Willie backstage. Saw Willie.

01:59.520 --> 02:05.360
So cool to see Willie. He welcomed us to his street. He welcomes everybody here to Austin

02:05.360 --> 02:10.240
City Limits. When you come in, Willie greets you at the door. I know you're wondering did

02:10.240 --> 02:17.360
he smoke us out? He's actually, guys, no. He's very cool. Is that more of a character that he

02:17.360 --> 02:21.120
plays? He plays a character. He's like, please call me Bill. He's wearing a business suit.

02:22.480 --> 02:31.520
He was wearing like kind of a business jacket over a polo. Yeah. He's also like 36 years old.

02:31.520 --> 02:37.840
Yeah, that's the weirdest thing. He's also wearing a wire and that's hard too. He leaned over to get

02:37.840 --> 02:42.560
me a Starburst off our Starburst table and I saw it down his shirt and first of all, I was like,

02:42.560 --> 02:46.080
I'm seeing down Willie Nelson's shirt. This is a once in a lifetime experience.

02:46.080 --> 02:50.880
Mental picture, but also I saw the fucking wire. Yeah, I saw the wire, Willie. He does this funny

02:50.880 --> 02:57.360
bit though where like every five minutes, apropos of nothing, he'll just say, I'm not a cop. Yeah.

02:57.360 --> 03:04.000
Yeah, it's cool. It's really good. He said one thing that was so cool backstage, he's like,

03:04.000 --> 03:08.080
I think you guys are going to put on a great show tonight. Can I interest you in some marijuana,

03:08.080 --> 03:14.720
which is illegal within the state of Texas. Just to clarify that, would you still like some

03:14.720 --> 03:19.840
marijuana? And he said, you Travis McElroy. Travis said our names a lot out loud. Travis McElroy is

03:19.840 --> 03:24.320
the one who said that. He's reaching into his pocket. He narrated a lot. Everything we did,

03:24.320 --> 03:29.600
he said, and now you're walking across the room. Speak into the flower, he said a lot. Speak into

03:29.600 --> 03:35.280
my huge comical flower. And when I pulled out my gun, he was like, Bumblebee, Bumblebee,

03:35.280 --> 03:40.960
Bumblebee, Bumblebee. Just waiting and watching the windows. I don't normally have a gun,

03:40.960 --> 03:46.880
but when you cross the bounds into Texas, they give you one. They throw it in the open window

03:46.880 --> 03:51.680
of your car as you drive past. It was in my luggage actually, which is so weird. I didn't

03:51.680 --> 04:01.040
pack it. It was just in there with some honey, some local honey. Now one of those is for your

04:01.040 --> 04:06.480
allergies. Keep it straight. Keep it straight. It's not the gun. Well, we have returned to you

04:06.480 --> 04:12.960
Austin and the Chilean miners. We have reemerged from the ground. Are the Chilean miners known for

04:12.960 --> 04:21.200
returning to places? Guys, can I be honest with you? I miss the fucking cage. Let's go chug it

04:21.200 --> 04:28.000
off. Where's my wallet? Ah, fuck. I'm going back to the cave. Chilean miners too. I have to take

04:28.000 --> 04:34.000
this. The squeak wall. This time they have to get back in. Oh, they put up some kind of tape over

04:34.000 --> 04:38.160
the front. What are we going to do? We have to go back. Hey gang, this table's real wet and I was

04:38.160 --> 04:46.640
the only other one to do a show out here tonight. That's a cool mystery. Really? So anyway, this is

04:46.640 --> 04:52.720
an advice show. We are not used to playing theaters where there are people in the round here. So if

04:52.720 --> 04:59.280
you feel like you're not getting service- This is actually a thrust. Yeah, it's a thrust. In the

04:59.280 --> 05:04.000
round would be behind us. It's a thrust. Okay, Jesus. Three quarters, to be honest. I know you

05:04.000 --> 05:09.200
guys get frustrated because you have useless theater degrees. Fair enough. Seemed like they

05:09.200 --> 05:15.120
just came in pretty useful, Griffin. What news story will you be writing about this evening's

05:15.120 --> 05:26.720
performance? Anyway, why is James crying? Because he just got dunked on. So anyway, hi. If you feel

05:26.720 --> 05:32.800
like you're not getting service, please let us know silently. I don't know how you'll accomplish

05:32.800 --> 05:39.120
that, but here's the question. I get monthly massages as a way to de-stress and maintain sanity.

05:39.120 --> 05:44.400
Fuck yeah. I have seen the same person every month for a little more than a year. I noticed about

05:44.400 --> 05:49.360
three months ago while massaging my left hand, she seemed to avoid my pointer finger. Your pointer

05:49.360 --> 05:54.480
finger? My pointer finger. My punter finger. I thought- I'm gonna kick it there. I thought,

05:54.480 --> 05:59.200
okay, that's weird. She moved my right hand and massaged my hand and all five fingers.

06:00.160 --> 06:04.160
I thought maybe it was a fluke and I went on with my month until the next massage,

06:04.160 --> 06:16.160
it happened again and again the time after. It always is my left hand and always the pointer.

06:16.160 --> 06:19.680
Is there something that could be wrong with my finger to cause such an aversion? I mean,

06:19.680 --> 06:25.520
it's a pretty normal finger, I think, and this is now causing what should be a relaxing time

06:25.520 --> 06:30.640
into an anxious nightmare. Should I say something? What should I say? Please help.

06:30.640 --> 06:37.120
That's from Soar Pointer in DFW. Are you here? Okay. Hi. What are you gonna say like, hey,

06:37.120 --> 06:45.760
you forgot my finger. If you're ever wondering- No skipsies. If you're ever wondering if you should

06:45.760 --> 06:51.680
ask your massage therapist for a specific part of your body to be deeply serviced,

06:52.640 --> 06:59.600
repeatedly, the answer is yes, obviously. How else are they gonna know? How else will they know

06:59.600 --> 07:03.600
what you are? There's a 0% chance it's a normal index finger though, right?

07:05.040 --> 07:08.080
I'm thinking, because I was thinking about it, and if you get the other

07:09.520 --> 07:16.400
hand piggies, right? Sure. And then you skip that one to go for thumb. Yeah. It's harder to

07:16.400 --> 07:22.400
skip it than to just include it. Oh, maybe the massage therapist is super excited to get to

07:22.400 --> 07:27.520
that fucking thumb. Oh. Yeah, maybe it's not a bad pointer, maybe it's an awesome thumb.

07:27.520 --> 07:32.160
They're on the pinky like, oh God, this is the hand. I'm almost there. Ring finger. Oh shit.

07:32.160 --> 07:38.560
Here, the thumb is over. Middle finger. I can't take it anymore. I gotta get somebody down.

07:38.560 --> 07:43.600
How cool is your thumb? It's a cool thumb, probably. Maybe they saw you do something

07:43.600 --> 07:50.560
with that finger, huh? Yeah. Something evil. Do you legally have to tell us? This is a podcast.

07:50.560 --> 07:58.800
You have to tell us if you did something nasty. What did you do with your secret finger?

07:58.800 --> 08:11.040
I'd say you met my finger. What'd you do? No, but really, what'd you do?

08:11.040 --> 08:21.040
No answer. No answer. The crime is unspeakable. Terrible crime. Maybe it's just,

08:22.640 --> 08:26.560
maybe your massage therapist is just making sure you're paying attention and they're like bummed

08:26.560 --> 08:30.560
out that you haven't mentioned the finger. Yeah, it's a test on you. I clearly skipped their finger.

08:30.560 --> 08:36.800
This is how these things start to erode though. They skip the finger. You don't notice they skip

08:36.800 --> 08:41.920
two fingers, five fingers, the whole hand, the arm, the whole side of the body. Eventually you're

08:41.920 --> 08:46.720
paying $60 and they slap you on the butt. That's the whole massage. They say good game, chief.

08:47.280 --> 08:53.040
Good game, chief. Thanks for the 60 buckaroonies. That's been an hour. I don't think it has,

08:53.040 --> 09:01.760
do you know? Fuck. It could be accident though. Your body has so many parts

09:01.760 --> 09:07.840
if you think about it. Everybody close your eyes and try to list out all the parts of your wonderful

09:07.840 --> 09:15.200
body. At the top of your lungs. Good Christ. We can't say stuff like that. It's happened by my

09:15.200 --> 09:20.880
math four times. What? That's not an accident. You don't miss the exact same part of the body over

09:20.880 --> 09:24.320
and over and over again. That's true. If it was an accident, they would miss different things like,

09:24.320 --> 09:30.320
oh, didn't get my right foot that time. Is your left index finger maybe somehow bad or the same

09:30.320 --> 09:37.040
exact color of the fabric of the massage table? Do you have camo finger? Do you have one camouflage

09:37.040 --> 09:42.320
finger? Because that would fucking do it. Do you have like a real shifty finger where they go for

09:42.320 --> 09:46.960
and the finger just dodges out of the way and they can't see? Yeah, maybe they're trying to rub the

09:46.960 --> 09:53.440
finger, but you instinctively pull it away because it's your weakest finger. Did you lose your finger

09:53.440 --> 09:58.880
in a lawn mowing accident? Now you have phantom finger. Do you have phantom finger? Do you have

09:58.880 --> 10:03.440
phantom finger? If so, you have to tell us. You legally have to tell us. It's a podcast.

10:04.160 --> 10:06.560
How about a Yahoo? Okay. I feel like we helped enough.

10:09.760 --> 10:13.840
This one was sent in by Graham Roebuck. Thank you, Graham. It's an anonymous Yahoo Answers user.

10:13.840 --> 10:19.200
I'm going to call them Scalver. Scalver asks,

10:21.520 --> 10:24.320
why are we don't see nights in this day and age?

10:24.320 --> 10:31.040
I assume you mean like K nights. Yes, Travis.

10:31.040 --> 10:37.920
Now like why don't we see beautiful starry nights? Homophones good every time. They show up as a joke.

10:37.920 --> 10:43.600
The homophone tree is a giver. Ripe fruits on the homophone tree.

10:45.440 --> 10:48.240
Why are we don't see nights in this day and age?

10:48.240 --> 10:54.800
Maybe we do. Okay. Okay. Griffin.

10:56.080 --> 11:01.280
Griffin, it's me, the cops. You legally can't interrupt your brother for the next two minutes.

11:01.280 --> 11:05.600
Yeah. So Travis, maybe we do go on. Okay. I am saying.

11:07.520 --> 11:14.240
Hold on. I'm looking at the timer. No bullshit. Go. I'm saying that maybe when you see

11:14.240 --> 11:22.240
on like a BuzzFeed, like a man climbs outside a bridge to save like a puppy on like the leg of

11:22.240 --> 11:27.360
the bridge or whatever it's called, the bridge holder, a man saved it and you're like, oh,

11:28.000 --> 11:31.200
what good person. And I'm like, no, that person's a night.

11:31.920 --> 11:34.480
And the person who put the dog there is an evil night.

11:34.480 --> 11:44.240
Okay. Time in. I'm sorry. I made it a good 20 seconds to my great credit.

11:45.120 --> 11:49.680
So there were a lot of things in there that you kind of showed that you didn't know about.

11:52.640 --> 11:56.960
Okay. The bridge one is a gimme. Yeah. Yeah. The bridge is a gimme. I know that there's

11:57.520 --> 11:59.920
bridge pillar. That's not right. Yep. Yep. That's it.

11:59.920 --> 12:10.560
It doesn't feel right. Did they night them as a result of their actions or were they nights before?

12:10.560 --> 12:15.280
They were nights before. Okay. That's why they had to save the dog. They were walking over in

12:15.280 --> 12:19.520
the store. They see the dog down there and like, ah, damn it. And then they had to save the goddamn

12:19.520 --> 12:29.040
dog. The evil night on his Google calendar had a thing that said get dog and then another

12:29.040 --> 12:38.080
appointment right after that that said place dog gotten in previous GCAL entry on top of bridge leg.

12:40.640 --> 12:46.560
And so this hope other night doesn't come along. Evil night walks under bridge and just like lifts

12:46.560 --> 12:52.800
a dog up, puts it on top of the bridge leg and says, Ooh, that that's good. That's good stuff.

12:52.800 --> 13:00.880
That's good evil there. I hope you're happy evil Jesus. I've done your bidding.

13:02.320 --> 13:06.480
I am Justin. Good job, Justin. I'm proud of you again.

13:09.920 --> 13:13.520
So how else does the dog get there? All right. We've had a lot of fun.

13:13.520 --> 13:24.080
I'm up here turning wine into clamato. Walk on water. No, I walked on your mom's rug.

13:25.760 --> 13:30.000
The one that's just for guests and I wore my shoes.

13:34.080 --> 13:36.240
I found Lazarus and I killed him.

13:36.240 --> 13:41.520
Some of the miracles of evil. Jesus. Sure.

13:44.640 --> 13:49.680
Killing someone isn't really a miracle. Yeah, that's easy. They gave me five fish

13:49.680 --> 13:54.640
and three loaves of bread and I scrum it down on that shit. Okay.

13:57.360 --> 14:01.360
Listen, we all went to Southern Baptist Church for a long time. We can list out all the miracles.

14:01.360 --> 14:07.840
Don't mean to brag. Why the fuck aren't there nights this day? Travis's shit was not real,

14:07.840 --> 14:12.560
was not in the realm of realness. Well, there are. Doesn't the like Elton

14:12.560 --> 14:17.200
John's a night, right? Aren't there moderns? I don't think he's the same kind of night.

14:17.200 --> 14:24.320
No, he is. No, he is. He is. He is. If they go to war, the queen calls him up. It's like,

14:24.320 --> 14:31.120
all right, strap up. Saturday night's all right for fighting. Let's fucking do this.

14:33.120 --> 14:39.680
You made a fucking promise. It's go time, Elton. You're going to space to claim Mars,

14:40.480 --> 14:47.680
rocket man. Prove it. What other songs? So tough. A lot of fun songs. You can use your father's gun

14:47.680 --> 14:56.800
so he had another song called my friend. Take a crocodile with you. Sorry, Sir Elton. This is

14:56.800 --> 15:05.120
the circle of life. This is the way these things go. From Lion King? Yeah. All right. Here's another

15:05.120 --> 15:10.000
question. Whenever I'm invited to someone's house to hang out, I always bring some kind of food.

15:10.720 --> 15:13.760
This feels like the polite thing to do in exchange for hospitality.

15:13.760 --> 15:21.520
The problem is no one ever seems to eat what I bring. My chips and queso go ignored and I'm

15:21.520 --> 15:30.800
left picking at it by myself. Oh man, I didn't read that part. That's so sad. Okay. So my question

15:30.800 --> 15:36.560
is how can I enjoy these snacks without looking like I just brought them for myself or what can

15:36.560 --> 15:41.120
I do to get my friends to enjoy these snackums with me? That's from eating alone in Austin.

15:41.120 --> 15:46.400
This seems like a win-win to me. Either your friends enjoy your tasty meal or you get to eat

15:46.400 --> 15:54.000
like a pound of queso. Yeah. Okay. If we're all being honest with ourselves. Then let's and let's.

15:54.000 --> 15:58.080
When you present the queso, are you really selling it? Are you like anybody wants this?

16:00.480 --> 16:05.840
That's it. No. Who wants this stinky shitty queso? Nobody?

16:05.840 --> 16:12.320
Yeah. We didn't, I didn't see, like I said, I didn't see the part where you said you picked at

16:12.320 --> 16:17.680
it. If you're holding it in your arms the entire time. Come get some queso. Does anybody want some

16:17.680 --> 16:24.160
of this? Who wants to fucking wrestle me for queso? Come in for a chip hug. Yeah. There's

16:24.160 --> 16:31.600
some parties that you bring food to. There's some parties that you don't, you can't just decide as a

16:31.600 --> 16:36.880
guest that it's a party everybody's bringing food to. Sure. The host won't know. If I was a, okay,

16:37.600 --> 16:41.360
there's a lot of foods that you can eat without knowing the contents of.

16:42.080 --> 16:46.320
Queso is at the very bottom of the list. You start with queso, then you work up from there.

16:46.320 --> 16:50.400
If I'm the host of this party, I'm going to see that and walk over to my friends like,

16:51.280 --> 16:58.560
hey, I didn't, that's not my queso. I don't know. I don't know where that queso came from.

16:58.560 --> 17:04.880
I wouldn't eat that queso. I don't know where it, in fact, I wouldn't even say I'm 100% sure it's

17:04.880 --> 17:10.240
queso. It may not be queso. They don't make transparent cheese. What if they brought queso

17:10.240 --> 17:18.800
and no chips? Surely you have chips somewhere. There's a whole bowl right there in front of you.

17:18.800 --> 17:23.040
Look at it. The gelatinous sauce. Enjoy this cheese flavor.

17:23.040 --> 17:32.160
Maybe it's just free queso. It has to be microwaved. Gross. Why is that gross? It is

17:32.160 --> 17:40.000
gross though. No, you don't like cheese. It's raw queso is what you're saying. Where'd you put it?

17:42.720 --> 17:50.560
There's tables where food can go that it is communal, but if you put it under the sink

17:50.560 --> 17:56.080
and close it, no one's going to eat that queso. Okay. This is an excellent point because if you

17:56.080 --> 18:01.360
walk in and you put it by the table by the front door where you keep your keys and mail,

18:01.360 --> 18:04.400
if I walk in and saw queso, they're like, well, that's for trick-or-treaters.

18:08.240 --> 18:14.960
They are going to a queso party after this party. That's not for this. No, that's for later.

18:14.960 --> 18:19.040
If I saw it on someone's bedside table, I'd be like, oh, that's their nighttime queso.

18:19.040 --> 18:25.680
Yes. Similar point. What are you serving it out of? Because if you're using it on something

18:25.680 --> 18:31.280
from the Martha Stewart collection, like a nice oak tray with polished metal handles,

18:31.840 --> 18:37.040
now we're hopefully a bowl also and not just sort of loose queso slip sliding around there.

18:37.920 --> 18:42.800
Now we're talking. If you serve it out of a big toilet that you just got from the Lowe's

18:42.800 --> 18:48.640
and you wheel in on a wheelbarrow or something. Do you remember for a period in the 80s when

18:48.640 --> 18:54.720
everybody brought everything in Shed Spread Country Crock containers? Is that just our family? I guess.

18:56.080 --> 19:03.200
I have a Yahoo here. It's from Merit Polymer. Thank you, Merit. It's a Yahoo answers user,

19:03.200 --> 19:08.880
Al the Pal, who asks, why isn't my fruits and vegetable blog getting views?

19:08.880 --> 19:27.200
I made a blog to talk about how I love fruits and veggies. Spent $150 to get it started. Sorry,

19:27.200 --> 19:35.200
spent $150. Dollars? Somethings to get it started. Beans.

19:35.200 --> 19:43.120
I made a deal with a guy for a cow. Spent $150 to get it started. I even made a recipe involving

19:43.120 --> 19:52.560
putting cheese on broccoli. The ultimate sacrifice. You pour cheese. I hate to do this

19:52.560 --> 20:01.360
to these good veggies, but it'll get the clicks. I can't believe I ruined the broccoli for this.

20:01.360 --> 20:10.000
Yes. Sleep now, my sweet green prince. My grandma's broccoli. It's been in my family for years.

20:11.440 --> 20:19.200
It's an heirloom. Broccoli. And heirloom tomatoes. I am not getting supporters. How to get popular.

20:21.840 --> 20:27.920
They spelled it super wrong. Alert. I'd like to say something. Yes. It's this. S-E, okra.

20:27.920 --> 20:32.560
Okay. Justin didn't know how he was going to get that one in.

20:32.560 --> 20:39.440
I just wanted to say S-E, okra. Thank you. Because S-E-O is search engine optimization.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.400
These people got it already, so y'all don't listen, okay?

20:43.120 --> 20:46.320
Y'all go to the lobby, get yourselves a snack, and come back in 10.

20:46.320 --> 20:55.600
Okra. Take it back. Hey, how the fuck did you spend $150 on your vegetables website,

20:55.600 --> 20:58.720
my friend? Maybe it was in buying the vegetables.

21:01.360 --> 21:06.160
What are you supposed to do? Have a vegetables website without any vegetables on it? Come on.

21:06.160 --> 21:14.160
I'm imagining somebody with a van of potatoes. How many potatoes can I get for this many?

21:14.160 --> 21:18.160
Just taking them and placing them around the modem like...

21:18.160 --> 21:23.760
This is something. Go, go, go guys. Go, go.

21:25.120 --> 21:28.560
Maybe they like vegetables too much. Screaming at the modem. I like these.

21:30.240 --> 21:36.720
No, I guarantee this person paid like, I don't know, the cool neighborhood kid like $150 to

21:36.720 --> 21:40.320
start them a vlog like they said they would. And they're like, how's the website doing?

21:40.320 --> 21:44.240
And they're like, not a lot of clicks. I think I'm going to need another $20.

21:44.240 --> 21:48.640
Can you give me another $20? Maybe they like vegetables too much on the blog.

21:48.640 --> 21:50.960
Have you all noticed when you read a recipe for vegetables...

21:50.960 --> 21:53.680
Do you want to do this at the stand line? No, they love vegetables already.

21:54.320 --> 21:58.960
Do you ever notice when you read an online recipe for vegetables,

21:58.960 --> 22:03.680
after they write 3000 words about how supportive their husband is, you get to...

22:06.480 --> 22:09.760
You get to the part where they talk about vegetables and it's always like,

22:09.760 --> 22:17.200
these tastes exactly like hot butter popcorn. It's like, I don't think so. Actually,

22:17.200 --> 22:21.280
I don't actually think that, but it doesn't even feel guilty for not enjoying vegetables

22:21.280 --> 22:26.080
as much as they do. So maybe this blog is like making people feel a little bit put on the spot.

22:28.000 --> 22:34.400
I would pay $150 for a vegetable website where like the headline of the recipe is like,

22:34.400 --> 22:39.200
do you want to make vegetables palatable? This is fine. This is as close to good as it...

22:39.200 --> 22:43.760
Like it doesn't taste like hot butter popcorn, but it doesn't not taste like hot butter popcorn.

22:43.760 --> 22:47.040
You all are missing the fucking point of this artist's website.

22:48.240 --> 22:50.640
They're not making a blog about how to make tasty vegetables.

22:51.360 --> 22:54.720
I made a blog to talk about how I love fruits and veggies.

22:57.760 --> 23:00.400
It is a little narrow, narrowly targeted.

23:00.400 --> 23:10.240
Hut, hail, hail, wary internet traveler. Greg again. This time, asparagus. Love to eat it,

23:10.240 --> 23:14.880
but my pee. What? Little joke. Like and subscribe.

23:14.880 --> 23:20.160
Like this post as much as I like asparagus. Next week, kiwifruits.

23:21.280 --> 23:27.840
Spoiler alert, like them. How much? A lot. Teehee emoji.

23:27.840 --> 23:31.520
That's the whole post. Damn it. I used all my content for next week.

23:31.520 --> 23:35.600
I've burned it already. Anyways, support me on Patreon.

23:35.600 --> 23:39.200
Thanks. I need to recoup some expenses.

23:41.280 --> 23:46.000
Necessary expenses. Kiwis don't buy themselves.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.320
That's right. Not yet. Read on.

23:50.640 --> 23:53.840
I'm Jeff Bezos, and these are my new self-buying kiwifruits.

23:53.840 --> 23:59.360
Why isn't anyone liking this blog? This is when I started to compete with Amazon.

24:00.160 --> 24:01.120
All right. All right.

24:01.680 --> 24:04.240
I don't know why I said all right. It's your turn to read a question.

24:04.240 --> 24:11.360
I am a first-time plant dad. My hanging ivy has lived for about a year and a half so far.

24:11.920 --> 24:16.720
I'm not sure how because I've not changed its soil since buying it.

24:18.160 --> 24:20.640
All right. I was waiting to see what the reaction to that was because

24:20.640 --> 24:23.440
I don't actually know if that's... I heard no gasps. Yeah.

24:23.440 --> 24:25.680
I actually don't know if that's something or not.

24:27.040 --> 24:30.000
Can I get a quick... Actually, before we move on,

24:30.000 --> 24:32.320
can I get a quick round of applause if that's something?

24:34.080 --> 24:36.480
Thank you. Okay, that wasn't enough for it to be a thing.

24:36.480 --> 24:40.160
Wait, now stop. Can I get a quick round of applause if you have no fucking idea?

24:42.320 --> 24:45.440
Okay, perfect. So, it sounds like it's something.

24:46.960 --> 24:49.840
If I add those two together, I think that's literally everybody in here.

24:49.840 --> 24:55.920
Okay. I've not changed its soil since buying it and I often forget to water it.

24:55.920 --> 24:59.680
Potting soil is expensive and difficult to move when you walk everywhere.

25:00.480 --> 25:06.000
They put that in parentheticals. Does not address the watering issue, but okay. Fine. That's fine.

25:06.000 --> 25:10.400
Also, water is expensive? I have nothing.

25:10.400 --> 25:15.280
No. However, on my route home, they are building a bowling alley.

25:15.280 --> 25:17.520
A bowling alley with a few trees and planters.

25:17.520 --> 25:22.240
My question is, how do I steal some of that sweet brown stuff

25:24.640 --> 25:28.640
for my struggling plant son, Dirk Bandit in DFW?

25:30.640 --> 25:32.800
Are you worried that someday your plant will find out?

25:34.960 --> 25:35.840
I feel dirty.

25:37.360 --> 25:40.400
Well, hey, are you here?

25:41.600 --> 25:44.640
This is the best fucking short story I've ever read in my entire life.

25:44.640 --> 25:48.960
When the bowling alley showed up, who here was like, okay?

25:50.400 --> 25:51.280
Twist.

25:51.280 --> 25:55.120
Are you taking the plant bowling? Fuck yeah.

25:56.880 --> 26:02.160
Isn't there a Denzel Washington movie where his kid is sick and so he robs a hospital?

26:02.960 --> 26:05.200
This is like that, but the stakes are down here.

26:05.200 --> 26:05.840
Way lower.

26:05.840 --> 26:11.680
I mean, here's an option. I mean, steal the dirt. Don't steal the dirt. You only go around once.

26:12.240 --> 26:18.720
But one option would be to bring your plant son back to the bowling alley and plant them there.

26:19.600 --> 26:22.320
If you love something, you got to let it go. And maybe this is...

26:22.960 --> 26:27.600
You clearly are, if you'll excuse me, a delinquent parent.

26:28.880 --> 26:33.440
I understand the soil expense issue. Fair enough. The watering thing is hard to get past.

26:33.440 --> 26:37.920
Well, maybe there's a bowling alley employee out there with a heart of gold and a thumb of green

26:40.960 --> 26:43.920
who can step in where you have so clearly fucked up.

26:44.800 --> 26:49.200
I would also say if I was a landscaper who was like putting stuff in and I saw someone doing it,

26:49.200 --> 26:52.480
I was like, hey, what are you doing? And they're like, I'm planting a plant here.

26:52.480 --> 26:54.800
I'd be like, well, that's 10% less work for me to do.

26:54.800 --> 26:55.840
Perfect.

26:55.840 --> 26:56.800
Sounds great.

26:56.800 --> 26:58.960
Excellent. Thanks for the help. Appreciate it.

26:58.960 --> 27:02.240
Sounds great. Excellent. Thanks for the help. Appreciate it.

27:06.240 --> 27:07.920
I mean, don't steal the dirt.

27:10.800 --> 27:12.800
You would be the worst thing you go to prison for, by the way.

27:12.800 --> 27:16.960
No, it's not you wouldn't go to fucking prison because it's dirt and you can't own that.

27:16.960 --> 27:18.400
God owns it. But also...

27:19.280 --> 27:21.280
We've all watched Pocahontas.

27:21.280 --> 27:25.920
It is weird how if it's dirt is on the floor, it's like, ugh, God, clean it up.

27:25.920 --> 27:29.280
If you put the dirt in a bag, that'll be $8. Like, why?

27:30.400 --> 27:32.240
Yeah. Good point, guys.

27:32.240 --> 27:38.160
You wouldn't go to jail for it. What would happen would be way worse.

27:38.960 --> 27:46.400
The stigma associated with somebody seeing you rob dirt is some next level shit.

27:47.200 --> 27:48.320
Hey, what are you doing?

27:49.440 --> 27:50.240
And why?

27:50.240 --> 28:00.800
I'm taking a sample. We've had reports in the area of ash beetles.

28:02.640 --> 28:04.640
You're doing a really good job at this.

28:04.640 --> 28:07.840
I'm testing this at home.

28:09.360 --> 28:12.080
No, wait, my lab, my lab, my lab.

28:12.080 --> 28:13.120
My home lab.

28:13.120 --> 28:16.800
Do you really need that much dirt for your tests? You're taking a good wheelbarrow full there.

28:16.800 --> 28:24.080
Hey, listen, if you are an expert on ash beetles, like me, Dr. Ash...

28:27.360 --> 28:27.860
...Beetle...

28:29.280 --> 28:30.320
...Steen...

28:32.160 --> 28:35.760
...then you can do the rigorous testing.

28:36.320 --> 28:37.440
Well, that all tracks.

28:37.440 --> 28:37.920
Yep.

28:37.920 --> 28:40.000
Anyway, another suspicion here.

28:40.560 --> 28:42.000
Sounds good. Sounds good.

28:43.200 --> 28:45.040
Anything I can do to help? You need any money?

28:45.040 --> 28:48.160
Money? I just want to walk away.

28:50.480 --> 28:51.840
Are you peeing your pants?

28:52.720 --> 28:53.680
It's a different test.

28:53.680 --> 28:55.440
It keeps the beetles away.

28:55.440 --> 28:56.640
It's a different test.

28:56.640 --> 28:59.120
It's a base level for the pH balance. I have to...

28:59.840 --> 29:00.720
It's the control.

29:02.880 --> 29:06.480
Hey, why are they building a bowling alley?

29:06.480 --> 29:08.160
Hey, yeah, wait, huh?

29:09.200 --> 29:10.880
It's 2018.

29:10.880 --> 29:13.760
2018? All right.

29:13.760 --> 29:16.000
I guess people here want more bowling alleys.

29:16.800 --> 29:19.120
I'm not saying it's bad to have more bowling alleys.

29:19.120 --> 29:21.920
I'm saying, aren't there enough bowling alleys?

29:21.920 --> 29:25.920
To be fair, we do come from a city in West Virginia where there's at least

29:25.920 --> 29:29.040
two empty, waiting-for-someone bowling alleys.

29:29.040 --> 29:31.440
No, no, no, they closed down Colonial Lanes, didn't you hear?

29:31.440 --> 29:32.720
But it's still there, right?

29:33.680 --> 29:36.240
I mean, yeah, you can fucking bust in the windows and go bowling.

29:36.240 --> 29:39.120
No, but that's what I'm saying is you don't need to build a new bowling alley

29:39.120 --> 29:40.160
if you want to own a bowling alley.

29:40.160 --> 29:43.440
You can clear away some of the ivy and bowl in there, I guess, if you want.

29:43.440 --> 29:45.120
You can have the last of us bowling.

29:45.120 --> 29:49.360
But if I say, like, this is my bowling alley now, I feel like it is.

29:50.560 --> 29:54.080
Do you would like a Yahoo?

29:54.080 --> 29:55.600
I'm becoming a Yahoo answer.

29:57.360 --> 29:59.040
Um, yes.

30:00.320 --> 30:01.280
Unless you want me to just...

30:01.280 --> 30:04.240
The fucking audience even knows you're not going to let me get through it.

30:04.240 --> 30:11.040
Throw your clothes onto the bed.

30:13.280 --> 30:13.840
Oh, okay.

30:14.720 --> 30:17.360
And wait for me by the tree.

30:20.560 --> 30:23.280
I'm gonna swing, sing jingle bells to your head.

30:25.840 --> 30:27.840
That's a Christmas to me.

30:29.600 --> 30:32.080
That's a Christmas to me.

30:32.080 --> 30:35.680
That's a Christmas to me.

30:38.080 --> 30:40.160
Making love in the light of a tree.

30:43.200 --> 30:45.200
That's a Christmas to me.

30:45.840 --> 30:46.160
Okay.

30:47.360 --> 30:49.680
Pass me a glass of that mulled wine.

30:51.520 --> 30:54.560
Been 20 years since we've been like this.

30:57.280 --> 30:59.920
And yet it feels oh so fine.

30:59.920 --> 31:03.040
We're under the mistletoe, let's kiss.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.640
That's a Christmas to me.

31:07.680 --> 31:10.480
That's a Christmas to me.

31:11.600 --> 31:16.160
You and me and a little bit of holly.

31:16.880 --> 31:19.680
That's a Christmas to me.

31:20.720 --> 31:21.680
So this is a segment.

31:25.680 --> 31:26.960
This is a holiday special.

31:26.960 --> 31:28.480
That was a fucking joke.

31:28.480 --> 31:30.320
That was a fucking journey.

31:30.320 --> 31:33.280
Yeah, I want to explore before we get into this great segment.

31:33.280 --> 31:34.320
That's a Christmas to me.

31:34.880 --> 31:36.560
Let's explore what happened.

31:39.200 --> 31:45.120
I was a little thrown at the beginning when you said throw your clothes out of the bed.

31:45.120 --> 31:48.240
Yeah, so you first I'll see you by the tree.

31:48.240 --> 31:49.120
Yeah, Paul.

31:49.120 --> 31:50.240
Paul, I need another drink.

31:50.240 --> 31:52.080
Paul, if you can hear me, Paul, I need another drink.

31:53.680 --> 31:56.880
Let's throw our clothes not just on the floor as we prepare to make love,

31:56.880 --> 31:59.360
but do scoop them right under the bed.

31:59.360 --> 32:02.080
By the way, we haven't done this in 20 years.

32:04.560 --> 32:05.120
Thanks, Paul.

32:06.080 --> 32:08.080
It's been 20 years since we've been like this.

32:08.080 --> 32:12.880
You don't have to, you don't have to Tom Cruise and cocktail it for me.

32:12.880 --> 32:14.640
I'll just blend it myself.

32:14.640 --> 32:15.360
Thanks, old friend.

32:16.160 --> 32:18.240
Okay, I'm just going to ride it out.

32:18.240 --> 32:27.920
So in the segment, in the segment, that's a Christmas to me.

32:27.920 --> 32:29.200
Travis, don't look at the iPad.

32:29.200 --> 32:30.240
Don't look at the iPad.

32:30.240 --> 32:30.800
It doesn't matter.

32:30.800 --> 32:31.440
You wouldn't be able to tell.

32:32.880 --> 32:34.880
In the segment, that's a Christmas to me.

32:34.880 --> 32:41.280
I read the description of two Hallmark Christmas films that are real

32:41.280 --> 32:44.160
and one that I created in my mind's eye.

32:44.800 --> 32:46.880
Now, if you are a listener, my brother, my brother,

32:46.880 --> 32:49.600
me not familiar with this segment, it's because it's one episode old.

32:49.600 --> 32:51.040
So don't worry that you've missed a lot.

32:51.040 --> 32:54.640
Technically speaking, it's one day old, but it's only a holiday segment.

32:54.640 --> 32:55.600
So I got to get a lot in.

32:55.600 --> 32:55.920
Yeah.

32:55.920 --> 33:00.240
He can't do this and say, I don't know any other months of the year.

33:00.240 --> 33:00.640
Right.

33:00.640 --> 33:00.960
Okay.

33:00.960 --> 33:02.720
So here we go.

33:02.720 --> 33:04.640
And by the way, we're going to take a poll.

33:05.360 --> 33:08.960
If you actually know the answer, please don't vote because it will spoil.

33:08.960 --> 33:09.440
Okay.

33:09.440 --> 33:13.200
Unlike a lot of elections, if you know the right thing, don't vote.

33:13.200 --> 33:19.600
So first film is Switched for Christmas.

33:20.960 --> 33:21.520
Switched?

33:22.240 --> 33:23.360
Switched for Christmas.

33:23.360 --> 33:24.880
Not a Switch for Christmas.

33:24.880 --> 33:31.280
Just because they are identical does not mean these twins even like each other.

33:32.240 --> 33:37.200
Estrange twin sisters played by Candace Cameron Brewer get together.

33:37.200 --> 33:37.760
That's right.

33:37.760 --> 33:38.640
Say that last name one more.

33:38.640 --> 33:40.000
Candace Cameron Brewer.

33:40.000 --> 33:40.160
Okay.

33:41.120 --> 33:42.480
That's Candace Cameron's new name.

33:42.480 --> 33:43.360
Candace Cameron Brewer.

33:44.160 --> 33:47.360
Estrange twin sisters get together for an obligatory pre-Christmas lunch

33:47.360 --> 33:49.120
a year after their mother's death.

33:49.840 --> 33:50.240
Sorry.

33:50.240 --> 33:55.360
Both women are unhappy and frustrated with their own lives, though not close.

33:55.360 --> 33:57.200
Each is envious of the other's life.

33:57.840 --> 33:59.520
It's a nasty Christmas movie.

33:59.520 --> 34:02.320
What's a twin do but to take advantage of this?

34:02.880 --> 34:03.920
And who would be the wiser?

34:04.480 --> 34:07.760
They do what any identical twins in need of new outlets would do.

34:07.760 --> 34:10.080
They swap lives until Christmas day.

34:10.080 --> 34:12.800
That's a fucked up thing to say about identical twins.

34:12.800 --> 34:16.240
And by doing so, each woman discovers the true meaning of her life

34:16.240 --> 34:19.200
and gains a deeper perspective and appreciation for what she already had.

34:19.200 --> 34:20.800
That's Switch for Christmas.

34:20.800 --> 34:22.160
That sucked so bad.

34:22.160 --> 34:24.720
The plot of it sucked and the way it was written was quite bad.

34:24.720 --> 34:26.000
So I hope that one wasn't yours.

34:26.000 --> 34:29.360
Also, I would say if that movie is real,

34:30.240 --> 34:34.640
100% chance there's a scene with a husband involved of like,

34:34.640 --> 34:37.120
hey, honey, let's make love tonight.

34:37.120 --> 34:39.680
Oh, no, it's my twin sister's husband.

34:39.680 --> 34:40.800
And that's in there, right?

34:40.800 --> 34:44.000
Also, no disrespect, but nobody has ever said,

34:44.000 --> 34:45.040
we're making a movie.

34:45.040 --> 34:47.280
I would love to get Candace Cameron in it twice.

34:49.440 --> 34:51.600
How is that supposed to be no disrespect?

34:53.120 --> 34:54.560
Fairly disrespectful.

34:54.560 --> 34:55.440
Can I move on?

34:55.440 --> 34:55.920
Yes.

34:55.920 --> 34:58.240
The next film is called A Shoe Addict's Christmas.

35:00.720 --> 35:02.080
As Christmas approaches,

35:02.080 --> 35:04.320
Noelle, played by Candace Cameron Bure,

35:04.320 --> 35:06.960
is at a crossroads in her life when it seems that love,

35:06.960 --> 35:10.400
a connection with her father, and her dream career are out of reach.

35:10.400 --> 35:14.080
When she stays late at her job in a department store on a snowy Christmas Eve,

35:14.080 --> 35:16.640
she accidentally gets locked in after closing.

35:16.640 --> 35:19.680
She isn't too concerned about the prospect of spending the night in the store

35:19.680 --> 35:23.680
until a quirky woman appears out of nowhere in the shoe department

35:23.680 --> 35:26.240
and tells Noelle that she's her guardian angel.

35:27.440 --> 35:31.440
Soon, Noelle finds herself revisiting Christmas's past, present, and future.

35:31.440 --> 35:35.520
She must work with her new neighbor, a handsome, Christmas-loving firefighter,

35:36.320 --> 35:38.000
to plan the annual...

35:40.480 --> 35:44.720
How would you describe yourself in three descriptive terms?

35:44.720 --> 35:48.240
There's a fucking Christmas tree in that apartment, no!

35:48.240 --> 35:50.480
Not like this, Jesus!

35:50.480 --> 35:53.200
Not like this, Jesus, God, who I love for Christmas!

35:54.160 --> 35:56.560
The annual Christmas charity gala will,

35:56.560 --> 35:58.320
visiting the holidays of yesterday,

35:58.320 --> 36:02.080
and tomorrow, help Noelle take new chances and discover the true spirit of Christmas.

36:02.080 --> 36:06.880
And in realizing the only thing standing in her way is leading a fulfilling life as herself,

36:06.880 --> 36:10.480
will the love she has longed for all her life be the best surprise gift of all?

36:10.480 --> 36:12.400
And that is a shoe addict's Christmas,

36:12.400 --> 36:15.920
starring Candace Cameron-Burr and, as her guardian angel, Jean Smart.

36:15.920 --> 36:17.520
Hmm. Hmm.

36:18.560 --> 36:21.200
Last film. A tailor-made Christmas.

36:21.920 --> 36:25.120
New York fashion designer Grace Preston, played by Candace Cameron-Burr,

36:25.120 --> 36:29.440
isn't thrilled about spending the holidays in her tiny hometown of Charity Falls, Wisconsin.

36:29.440 --> 36:34.640
But when the dress her step-sister Anna's Christmas Eve wedding is lost in shipping,

36:34.640 --> 36:37.920
Grace is guilted into crafting a last-minute replacement by their overbearing mother,

36:37.920 --> 36:40.000
played by Mary Margaret Hume,

36:40.000 --> 36:41.840
who you'll remember, of course, from Dawson's Creek.

36:41.840 --> 36:42.640
Ah.

36:42.640 --> 36:47.920
Grace is making the best of a bad situation until she meets the best man at the right time.

36:47.920 --> 36:51.040
And that's when she finds out she's the best man in the world.

36:51.040 --> 36:56.400
Grace is making the best of a bad situation until she meets the best man at a pre-wedding luncheon

36:56.400 --> 36:59.680
and learns it's none other than her high school boyfriend, Brad Phillips.

36:59.680 --> 37:02.720
After a college football injury ended his dreams of going pro,

37:02.720 --> 37:04.960
Brad turned his attention to Tailor Made,

37:04.960 --> 37:07.200
a charity that provides handcrafted business,

37:07.760 --> 37:11.760
sorry, handcrafted business attire to homeless men and women heading to job interviews.

37:11.760 --> 37:13.360
Brad is kind, caring and intelligent,

37:13.360 --> 37:16.800
but he's also put down roots in Charity Falls as Christmas Eve approaches.

37:16.800 --> 37:22.400
Grace must choose between a life with Brad and following her dreams in the fashion industry.

37:22.400 --> 37:22.800
Fuck.

37:22.800 --> 37:23.920
These are three films.

37:23.920 --> 37:26.080
I can't fucking believe one is not real.

37:26.080 --> 37:28.720
One, those are all so good.

37:28.720 --> 37:29.200
They're all really good.

37:29.200 --> 37:30.320
They're all a Christmas to me.

37:30.320 --> 37:31.520
I mean, not good.

37:31.520 --> 37:32.160
No, they're quite bad.

37:32.160 --> 37:32.640
Okay, listen.

37:32.640 --> 37:37.040
They're all a Christmas to me, but I want to know which is the one that is a Christmas to me.

37:37.040 --> 37:38.560
Should we take audience poll first?

37:38.560 --> 37:40.880
No, I want to hear you two before they bias you.

37:40.880 --> 37:44.000
The first one, Switch to Christmas, has to be real

37:44.000 --> 37:48.080
because I know there's more than one of that exact movie that exists out there.

37:48.080 --> 37:50.880
So if there's more than one, this is probably among the crew.

37:52.160 --> 37:52.800
I have my guess, Travis.

37:52.800 --> 37:54.960
But if I found two Candace Cameron Bure movies,

37:55.600 --> 37:59.520
boy, a good punchline would be a movie with two of her in the same film.

37:59.520 --> 38:00.480
That would be a good punchline.

38:00.480 --> 38:01.440
No, no, no, no.

38:01.440 --> 38:02.480
I'm okay.

38:02.480 --> 38:03.200
I've got mine.

38:03.200 --> 38:04.080
I got mine.

38:04.080 --> 38:04.720
Okay.

38:04.720 --> 38:06.240
I'm going to Shoe Addicts Christmas.

38:06.240 --> 38:07.600
Mine is also Shoe Addicts Christmas is Fake.

38:07.600 --> 38:08.720
Shoe Addicts Christmas is Fake.

38:10.080 --> 38:11.440
I think there's a lot of diversion in there.

38:11.440 --> 38:15.120
Like you say, oh, and it's got a Jane Smyrna.

38:15.120 --> 38:16.960
We're going to take a quick poll from the audience.

38:17.520 --> 38:20.000
The first we're just going to do just by cheers.

38:21.040 --> 38:24.320
First film was Switch to Christmas.

38:24.320 --> 38:25.600
Round of applause if you think that's fake.

38:28.000 --> 38:28.500
Okay.

38:29.040 --> 38:31.600
Second film was a Shoe Addicts Christmas.

38:31.600 --> 38:32.880
Round of applause if you think that's fake.

38:36.080 --> 38:37.280
Okay, thank you.

38:37.280 --> 38:39.280
Our third film was A Tailor Made Christmas.

38:39.280 --> 38:40.960
A round of applause if you think that's fake.

38:43.600 --> 38:47.280
The film that I made up.

38:47.280 --> 38:49.040
Well, actually Sydney made up mainly,

38:49.040 --> 38:52.320
but I hope is A Tailor Made Christmas is a fake.

38:55.040 --> 38:57.520
Switch for Christmas is real?

38:57.520 --> 39:00.320
Switch for Christmas is so fucked

39:00.320 --> 39:02.720
because one of the women has two children.

39:02.720 --> 39:04.160
I can't deal with these idiots.

39:04.960 --> 39:07.280
I can't deal with these idiots at Christmas.

39:07.280 --> 39:09.360
Bye.

39:09.360 --> 39:09.920
Bye.

39:09.920 --> 39:12.000
I'm living at my sister Deborah's apartment

39:12.000 --> 39:13.120
and loving it.

39:14.640 --> 39:16.560
Hey, idiots.

39:16.560 --> 39:17.520
Mom's gone.

39:17.520 --> 39:18.000
Bye.

39:18.000 --> 39:18.640
Enjoy my kids for Christmas.

39:18.640 --> 39:20.880
Have you and Sydney thought about pitching movies

39:20.880 --> 39:22.240
to the Hallmark Channel?

39:22.240 --> 39:24.000
She's got a gift, honestly.

39:24.000 --> 39:26.960
A lot of this is like, you know that scene

39:26.960 --> 39:29.280
where Sally Aries like throwing the music around?

39:29.280 --> 39:30.480
Like, how does he do it?

39:30.480 --> 39:32.800
That's me typing these down when Sydney's like,

39:32.800 --> 39:34.640
and then Candace Cameron Brewer is like,

39:34.640 --> 39:38.480
this woman was, the mother of my children

39:38.480 --> 39:41.120
was dictating scenes to me that would be in the movie

39:41.680 --> 39:43.600
if she filled it out to a spec script.

39:47.680 --> 39:49.200
She was like, there would fully be a scene

39:49.200 --> 39:51.360
where her company is like,

39:51.360 --> 39:53.200
good news, Bloomingdale's loves your new collection,

39:53.200 --> 39:54.560
but they want to see more by New Year's Eve.

39:54.560 --> 39:56.160
So we need you back here immediately.

39:56.160 --> 39:57.200
And she would then have to choose.

39:57.200 --> 39:59.040
The name of the city was Charity Falls, right?

39:59.040 --> 40:00.160
Charity Falls, Wisconsin, yeah.

40:00.160 --> 40:01.280
That should have been the giveaway.

40:01.280 --> 40:04.240
No, I actually thought that was so Hallmark

40:04.240 --> 40:06.720
that it was about a charity called Taylor Merck.

40:06.720 --> 40:07.600
Bro, it's not a giveaway.

40:07.600 --> 40:09.920
The woman in the last film is called Noel.

40:09.920 --> 40:11.120
Like, it's not a giveaway.

40:11.120 --> 40:12.000
They're all like this.

40:12.000 --> 40:14.480
Half the towns in these fucking movies are Christmas.

40:14.480 --> 40:16.960
Christmas town or Christmas city, Christmasburg.

40:17.840 --> 40:19.920
I live in Christmas Eve town.

40:30.960 --> 40:33.120
Hello, party people, and welcome.

40:33.120 --> 40:35.360
Thank you for listening to this episode.

40:35.360 --> 40:36.480
Travis, oh, Travis.

40:36.480 --> 40:38.400
You've heard so much of it already.

40:38.400 --> 40:40.240
Oh, help me, Travis.

40:40.240 --> 40:41.680
Oh no, Griffin, what's wrong?

40:41.680 --> 40:44.720
I busted my cut laughing at this great episode

40:44.720 --> 40:48.720
and all the great jokes that we had at Austin, Texas.

40:48.720 --> 40:49.840
I've heard of it, yes.

40:49.840 --> 40:50.640
It's my favorite.

40:50.640 --> 40:55.600
And so now we are going to tell you about our sponsors.

40:56.240 --> 40:58.080
The tragic thing is I've clicked away

40:58.080 --> 41:00.320
from where the list of the sponsors is.

41:00.320 --> 41:01.840
Well, can I say, Griffin,

41:01.840 --> 41:03.360
if you have injured yourself,

41:03.360 --> 41:06.400
might I recommend laying down on this Casper mattress?

41:06.400 --> 41:07.680
No, no, gotta go to the hospital.

41:07.680 --> 41:08.240
Did you not hear me?

41:08.240 --> 41:09.680
My tummy busted open, Travis.

41:09.680 --> 41:11.280
I got sepsis.

41:11.280 --> 41:13.760
Because I have found that when I am injured

41:13.760 --> 41:16.000
and want to rest and recuperate,

41:16.000 --> 41:17.760
well, there's no place better to do that

41:17.760 --> 41:19.520
than my Casper mattress.

41:20.320 --> 41:20.960
This is true.

41:20.960 --> 41:23.040
The other day, and listen, I'm not a doctor.

41:23.040 --> 41:25.520
The other day, my hand hurt really bad.

41:25.520 --> 41:27.760
I think I'd injured it signing posters

41:27.760 --> 41:29.760
and books and stuff at the Austin show.

41:29.760 --> 41:30.960
So fucking bougie.

41:30.960 --> 41:32.000
And I laid down.

41:32.000 --> 41:33.360
I took a nap, half hour.

41:33.360 --> 41:35.760
When I woke up, my hand was completely healed.

41:35.760 --> 41:37.760
So I attribute that to-

41:37.760 --> 41:40.320
Christ, Christ-like these mattresses are.

41:40.320 --> 41:41.120
That's what I'm saying.

41:41.120 --> 41:42.720
They're the Holy Ghost of mattresses.

41:43.840 --> 41:45.040
Oh, that's great.

41:45.040 --> 41:45.520
Thank you.

41:46.080 --> 41:48.080
And you can check them out now.

41:48.080 --> 41:49.440
They offer affordable prices

41:49.440 --> 41:51.120
because Casper cuts out the middleman

41:51.120 --> 41:52.720
and sells directly to the consumer.

41:52.720 --> 41:54.800
Casper brand mattresses combine

41:54.800 --> 41:56.960
multiple supportive memory foams

41:56.960 --> 41:58.640
for a quality sleep service

41:58.640 --> 42:01.680
with the right amounts of both sink and bounce.

42:01.680 --> 42:04.640
It's eight sink and 14 bounce.

42:04.640 --> 42:05.440
That's it.

42:05.440 --> 42:07.360
Well, Griffin, you gave away a-

42:07.360 --> 42:08.320
Oh, shit.

42:08.320 --> 42:09.840
Secret family recipe.

42:09.840 --> 42:11.280
And you can be sure of your purchase

42:11.280 --> 42:14.800
with Casper's 100 night risk-free sleep on it trial.

42:14.800 --> 42:17.360

42:23.600 --> 42:25.680
Terms and conditions apply.

42:25.680 --> 42:27.280
Can I tell you about some shops?

42:27.280 --> 42:28.000
Yes, please.

42:28.000 --> 42:29.840
Can I tell you about a little bit of stomps?

42:29.840 --> 42:31.440
Please tell me about stomps.

42:31.440 --> 42:32.640
Listen, it's the holidays

42:32.640 --> 42:34.400
and around the holidays times

42:34.400 --> 42:36.800
is when you must use stomps the most

42:36.800 --> 42:39.280
on your boxes and your letters.

42:39.280 --> 42:40.080
To Santa.

42:40.800 --> 42:42.560
To Santa Claus.

42:42.560 --> 42:44.160
He loves receiving your letters.

42:44.160 --> 42:45.600
If you don't put stamps on them though,

42:45.600 --> 42:46.720
he shreds them.

42:46.720 --> 42:47.360
He shreds them.

42:47.360 --> 42:48.720
You get put on the naughty list,

42:48.720 --> 42:53.360
which is just a short walk to the hell list.

42:53.360 --> 42:53.760
Yeah.

42:53.760 --> 42:55.520
And also the no fly list.

42:55.520 --> 42:56.720
Add the no fly list.

42:56.720 --> 42:58.560
But if you put it on the,

42:58.560 --> 43:00.640
if you put a stomps on the letters to Santa,

43:00.640 --> 43:01.920
you get TSA pre-check.

43:01.920 --> 43:02.640
Just like that.

43:03.200 --> 43:04.800
So stamps.com is great.

43:04.800 --> 43:05.600
It's very convenient.

43:05.600 --> 43:07.840
I hate leaving the house for virtually any reason.

43:07.840 --> 43:09.520
And stomps.com is there for me

43:09.520 --> 43:12.400
because they have the technology

43:12.400 --> 43:13.360
that they give to you

43:13.920 --> 43:15.920
so that your house technically becomes a post office.

43:15.920 --> 43:16.480
You got to be careful

43:16.480 --> 43:17.520
because people are going to come to you

43:17.520 --> 43:20.560
wanting to buy stamps.

43:20.560 --> 43:21.840
And I think that's illegal for you

43:21.840 --> 43:24.160
to open up a secret stamps resale market.

43:24.160 --> 43:25.440
So maybe I shouldn't even mention

43:25.440 --> 43:27.920
that possibility in this an advertisement for stamps.

43:27.920 --> 43:28.960
It is convenient though,

43:28.960 --> 43:31.200
because your breadbox will become a PO box.

43:31.200 --> 43:32.240
So that's nice.

43:32.240 --> 43:33.120
It is nice.

43:33.840 --> 43:34.320
Anyway,

43:34.320 --> 43:36.160
stamps.com can help save you a bunch of time

43:36.160 --> 43:37.200
during the holiday season.

43:37.200 --> 43:39.280
You can buy and print official US postage

43:39.280 --> 43:41.120
for any letter, any package, any class of mail

43:41.120 --> 43:42.640
using your own computer and printer.

43:42.640 --> 43:43.840
Then the mail carrier picks it up

43:43.840 --> 43:45.280
and you don't have to go to the post office.

43:45.280 --> 43:46.240
You're going to save a bunch of time.

43:46.240 --> 43:47.360
You're going to save a bunch of money.

43:47.360 --> 43:48.720
Stomps.com is the best gift

43:48.720 --> 43:50.640
you can give yourself this holiday season.

43:50.640 --> 43:52.320
You can enjoy the stamps.com service

43:52.320 --> 43:53.280
with the special offer

43:53.280 --> 43:55.360
that includes a four week trial plus postage

43:55.360 --> 43:57.280
and a digital scale without long-term commitments.

43:57.280 --> 43:58.880
Go to stamps.com,

43:58.880 --> 44:00.720
click on the microphone at the top of the homepage

44:00.720 --> 44:02.560
and type in my brother, all one word.

44:02.560 --> 44:04.000
That's stamps.com.

44:04.000 --> 44:05.520
Enter my brother.

44:05.520 --> 44:08.560
This message is for Michael and it's from Rebecca.

44:09.120 --> 44:10.640
Michael Felix says,

44:13.600 --> 44:15.360
which in Bubba speak

44:15.360 --> 44:16.880
means that we both love you

44:16.880 --> 44:19.120
and your poopy butt bones a whole lot.

44:19.120 --> 44:20.320
Hey, come on.

44:20.320 --> 44:21.360
It's what it says.

44:21.360 --> 44:23.840
Listen, some of us suffer from poopy butt bones

44:23.840 --> 44:25.520
and you don't got to make it sound jovial.

44:25.520 --> 44:27.280
That was a sad sentence, Travis.

44:27.280 --> 44:31.360
Love you and your poopy butt bones a whole lot.

44:31.360 --> 44:31.840
Thank you.

44:32.640 --> 44:35.280
Thanks for letting me harass you all the time,

44:35.280 --> 44:36.400
you sweet birdie.

44:36.400 --> 44:38.400
Now, please remember to Febreze the bathroom

44:38.400 --> 44:39.200
when you come out.

44:40.000 --> 44:42.080
I mean, there's a lot in there.

44:42.080 --> 44:43.920
Yeah, a lot about his poopy butt bones

44:43.920 --> 44:46.960
and sort of the issues that Rebecca has with them.

44:46.960 --> 44:49.360
But I guess now Michael's going to take that stuff

44:49.360 --> 44:50.960
a little bit more seriously.

44:50.960 --> 44:51.920
But who's Felix?

44:51.920 --> 44:52.640
Who is Bubba?

44:52.640 --> 44:53.760
Who are these characters?

44:53.760 --> 44:54.640
It don't matter.

44:54.640 --> 44:55.920
Here's one for Lewin

44:55.920 --> 44:58.160
and it's from Taylor and Ginger who say,

44:58.160 --> 45:00.160
happy 22nd birth from your...

45:00.160 --> 45:01.680
Whoa, 22...

45:02.560 --> 45:03.120
That's it.

45:03.120 --> 45:04.320
You beat the Duggars, right?

45:04.320 --> 45:06.800
That's a lot of births from your two best buds.

45:06.800 --> 45:08.480
We've spent 16 of your birthdays together,

45:08.480 --> 45:10.560
but I'm still sorry I missed the first five

45:10.560 --> 45:12.080
and Ginger, the first 16.

45:12.080 --> 45:14.160
You're a strong, beautiful, bespectacled bear

45:14.160 --> 45:15.360
and one smart cookie.

45:15.360 --> 45:17.360
Thanks for sticking with us in life and D&D

45:17.360 --> 45:19.840
even though you forced Ginger to flirt with you

45:19.840 --> 45:22.080
as a Southern fantasy sheriff.

45:22.080 --> 45:22.720
We love you.

45:22.720 --> 45:24.960
Have you been there, done that, huh?

45:24.960 --> 45:28.880
Wait, was Ginger the fantasy sheriff or was Lewin?

45:29.440 --> 45:31.040
I think all of them were.

45:31.040 --> 45:32.400
I think they're doing a Deadwood,

45:32.400 --> 45:38.240
but they're all playing the handsome man, you know, him.

45:38.240 --> 45:40.160
I just think I would like to see this game

45:40.160 --> 45:42.400
where a fantasy sheriff was like, flirt with me.

45:44.400 --> 45:46.640
Deadwood was just sort of a bunch of nasty men

45:47.200 --> 45:49.600
looking very sort of bedraggled,

45:49.600 --> 45:51.920
but then the one handsome man does come to town

45:51.920 --> 45:53.440
and it just goes around being all handsome.

45:53.440 --> 45:54.400
I haven't seen all of the show,

45:54.400 --> 45:55.360
but that's what I remember of him.

45:55.360 --> 45:58.320
Are you talking about Timothy Amundson as the handsome man?

45:58.320 --> 46:01.680
I'm talking about Timothy Olyphant as the handsome man.

46:01.680 --> 46:02.640
So anyway, this is for nobody.

46:02.640 --> 46:04.000
We can debate that later.

46:04.000 --> 46:05.920
Sure, and Travis is gonna read the last one.

46:06.560 --> 46:09.680
This is for Gabriel and it's from Kelly.

46:09.680 --> 46:11.520
Happy all events and holidays

46:11.520 --> 46:13.520
that fall in the first half of 2018.

46:13.520 --> 46:14.400
Well, we missed that.

46:15.200 --> 46:18.480
There is no one else I would want to share this crazy life with

46:18.480 --> 46:21.600
whether it's going to Taiwan, a train trip to Texas

46:21.600 --> 46:25.040
for the cotton bowl or yelling at the lions every Sunday.

46:25.040 --> 46:26.400
I love you more than anything.

46:26.400 --> 46:28.000
Oh no, they got lions outside their house, Griffin.

46:28.000 --> 46:31.280
I know, but they read the right books

46:31.280 --> 46:33.360
because yelling at them is the best way to fight the lions.

46:33.360 --> 46:35.040
You gotta yell and you gotta make yourself look big.

46:35.760 --> 46:36.960
Yeah, and you gotta yell stuff like,

46:36.960 --> 46:38.800
oh hey, I hate lions, I hate them.

46:38.800 --> 46:41.520
Oh, lions smell like poopy butt bones.

46:42.080 --> 46:42.960
Can we not?

46:42.960 --> 46:44.080
I'm so sorry, Griffin.

46:44.960 --> 46:47.840
So I hope you all enjoyed these Jumbotrons

46:47.840 --> 46:49.440
because they are the last.

46:49.440 --> 46:50.000
Oh yeah.

46:50.000 --> 46:50.500
Yeah.

46:51.280 --> 46:53.120
They are the last of the Jumbotrons.

46:54.000 --> 46:55.440
Yes, we're changing shit up

46:55.440 --> 46:58.080
and it's weird that we're doing this without Justin here.

46:58.960 --> 47:01.040
But yes, we are going to stop doing Jumbotrons

47:01.040 --> 47:03.200
both on My Brother, My Brother and Me and Adventure Zone.

47:03.200 --> 47:05.520
We're gonna continue doing them on our other shows

47:06.160 --> 47:08.560
because the reality of the situation

47:08.560 --> 47:11.280
is that selling them on our shows

47:11.280 --> 47:15.840
has become a very, very, unbearably difficult

47:15.840 --> 47:19.040
and competitive and disappointing process

47:19.040 --> 47:20.720
for virtually everybody involved.

47:21.840 --> 47:25.600
And yeah, we've enjoyed doing them

47:25.600 --> 47:28.240
and it's been a fun way to interact with y'all

47:28.240 --> 47:28.960
as we keep going on.

47:28.960 --> 47:30.880
But now we have lots of fun ways to interact with y'all

47:30.880 --> 47:33.920
and so we are putting them to bed.

47:33.920 --> 47:36.080
Now the Money Zone's gonna be a little bit tighter,

47:36.080 --> 47:38.400
which I'm sure a lot of people are gonna be also excited about.

47:39.440 --> 47:41.680
And yes, big programming update.

47:43.120 --> 47:45.360
Also, thank you all for listening to the show.

47:45.360 --> 47:46.400
You won't hear us again.

47:46.400 --> 47:49.040
We have some big things coming up this week

47:49.040 --> 47:50.080
so make sure you pay attention.

47:50.080 --> 47:51.360
Oh shit, yeah.

47:51.360 --> 47:51.920
Yeah, dude.

47:51.920 --> 47:53.520
To the My Brother, My Brother and Me Twitter account

47:53.520 --> 47:54.320
so you don't miss it.

47:55.040 --> 47:56.960
For real, we say shit like that all the time.

47:56.960 --> 47:59.040
It's going to be a pretty big week.

47:59.840 --> 48:01.600
Again, I can't believe Justin's not here.

48:01.600 --> 48:04.640
Yeah, so make sure you keep an eye on that

48:04.640 --> 48:05.920
because there's some stuff coming up

48:05.920 --> 48:08.800
and you can pre-order the Adventure Zone graphic novel

48:08.800 --> 48:11.040
at theadventurezonecomic.com.

48:11.040 --> 48:12.880
We did a lot of this shit at the end of the live show.

48:12.880 --> 48:13.680
Let's just get back to it.

48:13.680 --> 48:14.560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

48:14.560 --> 48:16.000
All right, well, that's it.

48:16.000 --> 48:19.600
Well, yeah, keep your eye locked on the Tweetos

48:19.600 --> 48:21.840
and we'll catch you later.

48:23.200 --> 48:24.480
Hi, this is Rachel McElroy.

48:24.480 --> 48:26.000
Hello, this is Griffin McElroy.

48:26.000 --> 48:27.040
And this is Wonderful.

48:27.040 --> 48:30.480
It's a podcast that we do as we are married

48:30.480 --> 48:32.240
and how's the ad going so far?

48:32.240 --> 48:33.840
Because I think it's going very good.

48:33.840 --> 48:36.400
We talk about things we like every week on Wednesdays.

48:36.400 --> 48:38.000
One time Rachel talked about pumpernickel bread.

48:38.000 --> 48:40.400
It was so tight you cannot afford to miss her

48:40.400 --> 48:42.000
talking about this sweet brown bread.

48:42.000 --> 48:44.240
We also talk about music and poems

48:44.240 --> 48:46.160
and, you know, weather.

48:46.160 --> 48:47.440
There was one, weather?

48:48.000 --> 48:49.920
One time Rachel talked about Baby Beluga,

48:49.920 --> 48:51.440
this song for like 14 minutes

48:51.440 --> 48:53.280
and it just really blew my hair back.

48:54.400 --> 48:56.560
So check us out on maximumfun.org.

48:56.560 --> 48:58.800
It's a cool podcast with chill vibes.

48:58.800 --> 49:00.480
Amber is the color of our energy

49:00.480 --> 49:02.000
is what all the iTunes reviews say.

49:02.720 --> 49:03.360
They will now.

49:08.400 --> 49:09.840
How about a Yahoo answer?

49:09.840 --> 49:10.340
Yeah.

49:10.340 --> 49:14.660
This one was sent in by a lot of people.

49:14.660 --> 49:16.820
Thank you everybody who got a hand on this ball.

49:16.820 --> 49:21.620
It's from Yahoo Answers user NoSummertime who asks...

49:23.780 --> 49:24.900
Oh wait, for Justin.

49:28.420 --> 49:30.820
Why the hell don't I like potato salad?

49:30.820 --> 49:43.540
I love potatoes, baked french fries, mashed hashbrowns,

49:43.540 --> 49:45.060
grilled side dish things.

49:46.660 --> 49:49.300
But the potato salad tastes like ass to me.

49:52.580 --> 49:53.780
WTF is wrong with me.

49:53.780 --> 49:56.900
It angers me and makes me want to punch someone in the face.

49:56.900 --> 49:58.900
It's the mayonnaise.

49:58.900 --> 49:59.700
It's the mayonnaise.

50:01.940 --> 50:03.620
Justin says mayonnaise.

50:03.620 --> 50:04.660
I buzzed in first.

50:05.220 --> 50:06.020
It's the mayonnaise.

50:06.020 --> 50:08.180
Mayonnaise tastes bad and things like that.

50:08.180 --> 50:08.900
It's the mayonnaise.

50:10.340 --> 50:11.540
It's the reason you don't like it.

50:12.340 --> 50:15.300
It's cause mayonnaise is a weird thing to bind something with

50:15.300 --> 50:17.860
and the reason you don't like it is the mayonnaise.

50:20.580 --> 50:21.540
Come at me.

50:21.540 --> 50:26.100
You didn't leave us much air to breathe in the bit zone.

50:26.100 --> 50:27.700
Maybe it's not mayonnaise.

50:31.860 --> 50:34.420
I mean, I do want to pitch this from Yahoo Answers user

50:39.060 --> 50:41.460
who says there are lots of ways to make potato salad.

50:41.460 --> 50:43.940
The one you have tasted probably wasn't very good.

50:43.940 --> 50:44.980
No big deal.

50:44.980 --> 50:48.900
Punching someone because you don't like potato salad is a bit over the top.

50:48.900 --> 50:51.460
The only one at fault here is you for not liking it.

50:51.460 --> 50:53.220
Punch yourself if you must.

50:53.220 --> 50:56.100
Anyway, that's my new SNL character.

50:56.100 --> 50:58.740
The guy that takes Yahoo Answers literally.

50:58.740 --> 51:01.300
Well, the question asker really liked it

51:01.300 --> 51:03.700
because they decided this was the best answer.

51:04.900 --> 51:08.100
I love the idea of like tasting some food and like, I don't like this.

51:08.660 --> 51:10.340
Don't blame that on anyone but yourself.

51:10.340 --> 51:15.700
Yeah, I will say that Yahoo Answers user NoSummertime does not like potato salad.

51:15.700 --> 51:17.620
They do like a slice of humble pie.

51:17.620 --> 51:18.660
That's what they were served up.

51:19.380 --> 51:20.820
They gobbled it down and said, you're right.

51:21.620 --> 51:22.020
You know what?

51:22.020 --> 51:22.500
You're right.

51:22.500 --> 51:23.620
That was over the top.

51:23.620 --> 51:24.500
I should not.

51:24.500 --> 51:25.620
I'm the asshole.

51:25.620 --> 51:27.220
I'm the one who tastes like ass now.

51:29.300 --> 51:32.500
It could be the coldness of the potato.

51:32.500 --> 51:34.740
You don't eat a cold potato most of the time, huh?

51:35.780 --> 51:36.740
It's probably the mayonnaise.

51:36.740 --> 51:37.860
It's just there's nothing else.

51:37.860 --> 51:40.100
It's just that it's definitely the mayonnaise.

51:40.100 --> 51:42.180
Mayonnaise is like a fish song.

51:42.180 --> 51:42.820
Now hold on.

51:44.740 --> 51:46.900
Listen really carefully because this part won't be in the show

51:47.780 --> 51:49.620
because it won't be funny, but it's true.

51:49.620 --> 51:51.380
Mayonnaise is like a fish song.

51:51.380 --> 51:55.220
If you listen to Kill Devil Falls, right?

51:55.220 --> 51:58.180
Or Free or any other great fish track on the album

51:58.180 --> 52:00.100
and it's three minutes and 30 seconds long,

52:00.100 --> 52:01.780
you're like, that was great.

52:01.780 --> 52:02.820
Great song construction.

52:02.820 --> 52:03.540
Great recording.

52:03.540 --> 52:04.340
Fantastic.

52:04.340 --> 52:05.620
You see it live.

52:05.620 --> 52:06.660
It's 30 minutes long.

52:07.220 --> 52:07.860
That's enough.

52:07.860 --> 52:08.500
Thank you.

52:08.500 --> 52:10.420
If you have a little bit of mayonnaise on a thing,

52:14.100 --> 52:16.100
I don't remember sandwiches being this wet.

52:18.020 --> 52:19.460
Welcome to the welcome.

52:19.460 --> 52:21.300
It's not like sloppy sloppy,

52:21.300 --> 52:25.140
but it's a little bit wetter than I remember.

52:25.140 --> 52:26.580
It's a little bit indulgent.

52:29.380 --> 52:32.100
And then there's like a line

52:32.100 --> 52:35.300
and it's the seven minute mark of the Kill Devil Falls,

52:35.300 --> 52:38.980
you know, Sioux City Falls, Iowa version of the song.

52:38.980 --> 52:40.420
They've got them all on Spotify

52:41.140 --> 52:43.620
and you listen to it for 17 minutes.

52:43.620 --> 52:45.780
It's like, that's enough mayonnaise.

52:45.780 --> 52:47.540
Hey Juice, are you real into fish?

52:47.540 --> 52:50.980
Cause what the fuck, bud?

52:50.980 --> 52:52.260
You got to tell us this shit.

52:52.980 --> 52:55.140
It was improvisational comedy.

52:55.140 --> 52:55.620
It wasn't.

52:55.620 --> 52:56.340
You knew a lot about fish, friend.

52:56.340 --> 52:57.700
You knew a lot about fish.

52:58.420 --> 52:58.900
All right.

52:58.900 --> 53:00.980
Here's the tip off that I pulled out on my ass.

53:00.980 --> 53:03.060
I was talking about Kill Devil Falls

53:03.060 --> 53:05.700
and I said Sioux City Falls, Iowa.

53:05.700 --> 53:06.100
Okay.

53:06.100 --> 53:07.540
So that was made up.

53:07.540 --> 53:08.660
Anyway, too much mayonnaise.

53:08.660 --> 53:09.860
After the whole Jimmy Buffet thing,

53:09.860 --> 53:11.220
I don't know who to trust anymore.

53:11.220 --> 53:11.540
Okay.

53:11.540 --> 53:15.380
Okay.

53:15.380 --> 53:17.380
I work at a local coffee shop

53:17.380 --> 53:18.980
and over the last couple of months,

53:18.980 --> 53:20.740
we've had a regular customer who comes in,

53:21.380 --> 53:23.140
sets up his personal home office in the shop

53:23.140 --> 53:26.420
and very loudly takes phone calls for his dental practice.

53:28.660 --> 53:31.460
I recently noticed that he has four cell phones on him

53:31.460 --> 53:34.580
at all times and uses all of them

53:34.580 --> 53:36.020
to take these business calls.

53:36.020 --> 53:37.140
Should I be concerned?

53:37.140 --> 53:40.500
Is he involved in some sort of black market dental operation?

53:41.220 --> 53:42.900
That's from Leave My Teeth Alone.

53:42.900 --> 53:46.740
Being a dentist isn't like writing a screenplay, right?

53:46.740 --> 53:49.220
That's not something you can just like post up

53:49.220 --> 53:50.980
at a Starbucks and do it.

53:52.500 --> 53:53.540
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

53:53.540 --> 53:54.500
You know what?

53:54.500 --> 53:55.300
What do I know?

53:55.300 --> 53:56.820
It's 2018.

53:56.820 --> 53:59.700
Maybe they're an at-home dentist.

53:59.700 --> 54:00.260
Thank you.

54:00.260 --> 54:01.220
They do house calls.

54:01.220 --> 54:01.540
They'll come.

54:01.540 --> 54:03.460
Do you have a chair that reclines

54:03.460 --> 54:05.620
and a good bright flashlight?

54:05.620 --> 54:10.020
Good bright flashlight and teeth hooks.

54:10.020 --> 54:11.140
I don't really have anything.

54:11.140 --> 54:11.860
I don't have anything.

54:11.860 --> 54:13.140
Do you have a toothbrush?

54:13.140 --> 54:14.100
You have a toothbrush.

54:14.100 --> 54:16.500
This is how I know you guys aren't dentists

54:16.500 --> 54:21.060
because you can't just buy a dentist store

54:21.060 --> 54:26.260
and then go in there and go in there with your chair

54:26.260 --> 54:28.580
and the light and the metal thing

54:29.220 --> 54:32.340
and open the door and say, I'm ready for teeth.

54:32.340 --> 54:32.820
Yeah.

54:32.820 --> 54:34.580
And then expect people to go.

54:34.580 --> 54:36.740
You have to build your client base

54:36.740 --> 54:38.900
through networking and...

54:38.900 --> 54:39.940
And Patreon.

54:39.940 --> 54:42.020
And Patreon and entrepreneurship.

54:42.580 --> 54:44.820
And you have to build your client base before.

54:44.820 --> 54:47.220
You have to say, would you be interested

54:47.220 --> 54:50.020
in a value-priced dentist who's just learning

54:50.020 --> 54:51.620
and cutting his teeth, if you will.

54:52.660 --> 54:53.140
But I won't.

54:53.140 --> 54:53.700
Hey, hey, hey.

54:53.700 --> 54:55.700
But I won't cut your teeth

54:55.700 --> 54:56.980
because I've only been in dentists for a week,

54:56.980 --> 54:58.740
but I'm pretty sure you're not supposed to do that.

54:58.740 --> 54:59.460
I know you don't.

54:59.460 --> 55:01.140
I don't know much yet.

55:01.140 --> 55:01.700
Yet.

55:01.700 --> 55:02.020
Yet.

55:02.020 --> 55:03.940
But I don't think I'm supposed to cut your teeth.

55:03.940 --> 55:05.540
I do know this, teeth are mad hard.

55:05.540 --> 55:07.300
I don't think you can cut them if you try.

55:07.860 --> 55:09.460
I've heard a lot about drilling

55:09.460 --> 55:11.300
and I plan on YouTubing that later

55:11.300 --> 55:13.380
to see if I can find some tutorials.

55:13.380 --> 55:14.420
I went to Home Depot.

55:15.140 --> 55:16.820
The drill seemed pretty big.

55:16.820 --> 55:17.300
So...

55:17.300 --> 55:19.700
If I'm being honest, I wouldn't want that.

55:19.700 --> 55:20.660
If you know of a...

55:20.660 --> 55:22.980
This could sound silly, but like a dentist depot.

55:24.820 --> 55:26.900
That would be funny to have the dentist

55:26.900 --> 55:28.180
come to your house for the fourth time

55:28.180 --> 55:30.500
and say, good news, got my own place.

55:30.500 --> 55:32.900
You can come visit me there from now on.

55:32.900 --> 55:33.140
Yeah.

55:33.140 --> 55:35.060
I've got lots of old highlights magazines.

55:35.060 --> 55:37.700
That would be the day I stopped going to that dentist.

55:37.700 --> 55:38.980
Like what would be better than a dentist

55:38.980 --> 55:40.340
who comes to your house?

55:40.340 --> 55:41.940
A dentist who doesn't come to your house.

55:43.940 --> 55:44.660
Fair.

55:44.660 --> 55:45.540
I'll grant you that.

55:46.100 --> 55:47.860
So we have some audience questions.

55:47.860 --> 55:50.020
I want to keep talking about this fucking dentist.

55:50.020 --> 55:50.900
Are you serious?

55:50.900 --> 55:52.340
Yeah, we can't leave this guy alone.

55:53.300 --> 55:53.780
Okay.

55:53.780 --> 55:56.580
For a lot of mostly because what he's doing is illegal,

55:56.580 --> 55:57.940
so we should keep an eye on him.

55:57.940 --> 56:00.580
What, okay. The four cell phones.

56:00.580 --> 56:01.860
Let's talk about that for a second.

56:02.660 --> 56:05.460
One's for his mistress, probably.

56:05.460 --> 56:08.820
And then the other three, we can talk about the...

56:08.820 --> 56:11.300
I feel like he's probably calling other people

56:11.300 --> 56:13.700
and saying like, hey, this is your dentist.

56:15.700 --> 56:19.380
I got arrested for getting drunk in the job

56:19.380 --> 56:22.340
and I don't think I'm going to be able to do that.

56:22.340 --> 56:25.060
I'm not going to be able to teeth.

56:25.060 --> 56:26.580
Drill right.

56:26.580 --> 56:30.420
Drill right clean through someone's whole head.

56:30.420 --> 56:34.340
So you should probably find a new dentist anyway.

56:34.340 --> 56:35.700
I'm scared of teeth now.

56:35.700 --> 56:36.900
I'm really scared of teeth.

56:36.900 --> 56:38.980
I got a phobia now and I got to go.

56:38.980 --> 56:39.380
Bye.

56:39.380 --> 56:42.900
They have one phone that they call other dentists with

56:42.900 --> 56:46.980
and they're like, hi, this is Timothy, dentist.

56:46.980 --> 56:50.900
And I was asked, I'm doing a book report about dentistry.

56:50.900 --> 56:52.500
Can you tell me where you get your tools

56:52.500 --> 56:58.180
and also how you do every part of your job?

57:02.180 --> 57:04.180
No, maybe their dental practice,

57:04.180 --> 57:06.260
their dental middleman and somebody calls them

57:06.260 --> 57:07.940
that you got it and then they call a dentist

57:07.940 --> 57:09.540
and then they just hold the phones together.

57:13.380 --> 57:14.900
Are you guys done yet?

57:14.900 --> 57:15.860
Okay, sorry.

57:15.860 --> 57:17.460
For 10 minutes, he sits in the corner

57:17.460 --> 57:27.700
and makes his phone 69 and I don't know why.

57:27.700 --> 57:28.580
What's that?

57:28.580 --> 57:29.940
You need an orthodontist?

57:29.940 --> 57:30.900
I got a third phone.

57:30.900 --> 57:33.220
I put you on the party line.

57:35.780 --> 57:36.820
Okay, so we will.

57:36.820 --> 57:37.940
Well, let's do audience questions.

57:37.940 --> 57:39.780
Yes, we have some picked out.

57:39.780 --> 57:40.260
We do it.

57:40.260 --> 57:41.060
We're doing it a new way.

57:41.060 --> 57:42.980
Probably since the last time we were here in Austin.

57:42.980 --> 57:45.060
Yeah, we're going to call some names and some seat numbers.

57:45.060 --> 57:46.420
You're going to come on down to the microphones.

57:46.420 --> 57:49.220
Can we get the spotlights down on the microphones

57:49.220 --> 57:51.060
in three, two, okay.

57:51.060 --> 57:52.100
Hey, what's up?

57:52.100 --> 57:52.580
Hello.

57:52.580 --> 57:53.380
Hey, who are you?

57:53.380 --> 57:54.100
I'm Brooks.

57:54.100 --> 57:56.340
Hi, Brooks.

57:56.340 --> 58:00.980
So my question is my boyfriend keeps on going

58:00.980 --> 58:08.740
into the pantry and grabbing handfuls of fettuccine uncooked.

58:08.740 --> 58:10.420
I would hope he's not grabbing handfuls

58:10.420 --> 58:11.860
of cooked fettuccine, Brooks.

58:11.860 --> 58:12.820
In your pantry?

58:12.820 --> 58:17.380
No, and eating them raw and he keeps calling them chips.

58:17.380 --> 58:17.620
Okay.

58:20.580 --> 58:22.660
How do I make him stop?

58:22.660 --> 58:23.940
Is your boyfriend here?

58:23.940 --> 58:24.180
Yeah.

58:24.740 --> 58:25.780
You're a monster.

58:27.460 --> 58:29.380
Words mean things.

58:29.380 --> 58:30.420
Does anybody remember?

58:31.060 --> 58:32.980
I haven't been to Olive Garden in many moons,

58:32.980 --> 58:36.820
but they do have like a little like fettuccine bottle

58:36.820 --> 58:38.580
that you can just grab them out of and shoot.

58:38.580 --> 58:38.980
Hold on.

58:38.980 --> 58:40.500
Was this a prank you guys pulled on me

58:40.500 --> 58:43.140
when we went to Olive Garden as kids?

58:43.140 --> 58:43.860
No, stop.

58:43.860 --> 58:44.740
Everybody shut up.

58:46.340 --> 58:48.740
Do they give you raw fettuccine to chew on

58:48.740 --> 58:50.100
in the lobby of the Olive Garden?

58:51.220 --> 58:53.380
You fucking bastards.

58:58.340 --> 58:59.700
The prestige.

59:08.180 --> 59:09.860
And now you have IBS.

59:09.860 --> 59:10.260
I did.

59:10.260 --> 59:10.980
We got him.

59:12.740 --> 59:15.220
What I need you, Brooks, we'll get back to you.

59:15.220 --> 59:17.300
What I need you two to understand is

59:18.020 --> 59:21.460
that was not the only time I went to Olive Garden.

59:25.300 --> 59:25.780
There were...

59:26.820 --> 59:28.820
Were there never employees around?

59:32.100 --> 59:38.020
I, wanting to seem like an authentic metropolitan diner,

59:38.020 --> 59:39.940
would always grab the fettuccine

59:39.940 --> 59:41.220
and walk over to my friends like,

59:41.220 --> 59:42.580
yeah, I'm a little peckish.

59:47.060 --> 59:48.020
I can't believe you did that.

59:48.020 --> 59:49.620
I can't believe literally I'm finding out

59:49.620 --> 59:51.140
in the worst imaginable venue.

59:52.020 --> 59:54.660
Speaking as a former Olive Garden employee,

59:55.460 --> 59:58.820
if I saw a little kid eating raw fettuccine,

59:59.460 --> 01:00:02.820
the odds of me stopping them are negative 1000%.

01:00:04.180 --> 01:00:05.540
Okay, Brooks.

01:00:05.540 --> 01:00:06.100
Brooks.

01:00:06.100 --> 01:00:09.700
Brooks, yeah, so I'm gonna sit this one out, Brooks.

01:00:10.900 --> 01:00:13.140
Brooks, is it possible that your boyfriend

01:00:13.140 --> 01:00:14.900
has been laboring under the same delusion

01:00:14.900 --> 01:00:16.820
as my brother for all these years?

01:00:16.820 --> 01:00:19.860
Oh, wait, they sell this for you to take home?

01:00:19.860 --> 01:00:22.260
Okay, a little fancy for myself then.

01:00:23.700 --> 01:00:26.660
Brooks, is it possible your boyfriend does not

01:00:27.220 --> 01:00:29.220
believe these are chips,

01:00:29.220 --> 01:00:34.340
but instead likes to annoy you by calling them chips,

01:00:34.340 --> 01:00:36.260
a thing I, not exactly that,

01:00:36.260 --> 01:00:38.420
but similar, do to my wife all the time?

01:00:39.460 --> 01:00:43.540
Is it possible your boyfriend loves chips

01:00:44.260 --> 01:00:46.180
and you never have chips

01:00:46.180 --> 01:00:48.340
and this is his way of passive-aggressively

01:00:48.340 --> 01:00:50.580
sort of guilting you into going,

01:00:50.580 --> 01:00:52.340
these are tasty chips.

01:00:52.340 --> 01:00:54.340
And as a raw fettuccine eater myself,

01:00:54.340 --> 01:00:56.900
I can tell you it's not a good chew.

01:00:58.260 --> 01:00:59.780
You do it and you put it in your mouth

01:00:59.780 --> 01:01:01.380
and your six-year-old brain thinks

01:01:01.380 --> 01:01:04.260
it'll turn the fettuccine in the heat of your mouth.

01:01:04.260 --> 01:01:05.540
It doesn't work like that.

01:01:05.540 --> 01:01:06.900
It doesn't work like that.

01:01:06.900 --> 01:01:08.260
It just doesn't work like that.

01:01:08.260 --> 01:01:08.760
Brooks?

01:01:09.620 --> 01:01:10.180
Yes.

01:01:10.180 --> 01:01:11.700
Did you eat all your boyfriend's chips?

01:01:14.900 --> 01:01:16.660
No, but he does bring that up

01:01:16.660 --> 01:01:19.700
every time he loudly crunches on them next to me.

01:01:20.580 --> 01:01:21.860
Brings what up?

01:01:21.860 --> 01:01:23.300
That I don't have any chips.

01:01:23.300 --> 01:01:25.060
Okay then, Brooks, that's the answer.

01:01:25.860 --> 01:01:27.940
All right, Brooks, we've got to buy this.

01:01:27.940 --> 01:01:28.340
We've sold it.

01:01:28.340 --> 01:01:32.420
You've got to buy some chips, Brooks.

01:01:32.420 --> 01:01:34.020
Somewhere in this audience,

01:01:34.020 --> 01:01:35.380
Brooks' boyfriend is going, yes.

01:01:36.740 --> 01:01:39.140
And now I shall have chips.

01:01:39.860 --> 01:01:40.900
Follow-up question.

01:01:40.900 --> 01:01:42.500
I don't know where to get chips from.

01:01:44.100 --> 01:01:46.340
Have you ever seen your boyfriend

01:01:46.340 --> 01:01:47.700
with a pot of boiling water

01:01:49.300 --> 01:01:51.140
cutting the bristles off a broom into it

01:01:51.140 --> 01:01:52.340
saying we're out of fettuccine?

01:01:53.940 --> 01:01:55.700
Oh, Brooks, here's what you do.

01:01:55.700 --> 01:01:57.380
Have you ever seen this boyfriend,

01:01:57.380 --> 01:01:58.580
plug your ears.

01:01:59.140 --> 01:02:00.500
Okay, go buy a bag of chips.

01:02:01.220 --> 01:02:02.420
Dump them all in the garbage.

01:02:03.300 --> 01:02:04.980
Put some raw fettuccine in it.

01:02:06.020 --> 01:02:07.700
Put a chip clip back on it.

01:02:07.700 --> 01:02:09.940
Put it back in the pantry and wait.

01:02:10.820 --> 01:02:11.860
And he's going to think he's in like

01:02:11.860 --> 01:02:13.460
a weird Twilight Zone episode

01:02:13.460 --> 01:02:15.380
where there have never been chips.

01:02:15.380 --> 01:02:16.340
Never been chips.

01:02:16.980 --> 01:02:17.460
Wait until-

01:02:17.460 --> 01:02:18.820
And then what's that you're boiling?

01:02:18.820 --> 01:02:19.460
Doritos.

01:02:19.460 --> 01:02:20.740
Yes, yeah.

01:02:21.300 --> 01:02:23.460
Wait until your boyfriend starts making fettuccine

01:02:23.460 --> 01:02:25.140
if you're real and walk over and smell the pop

01:02:25.140 --> 01:02:29.060
and say, mm, chip soup.

01:02:29.060 --> 01:02:30.260
My favorite.

01:02:31.620 --> 01:02:32.340
Delicious.

01:02:32.340 --> 01:02:32.900
Does that help?

01:02:33.540 --> 01:02:33.940
Yes.

01:02:33.940 --> 01:02:34.500
Okay, good.

01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:34.980
Thank you.

01:02:40.900 --> 01:02:42.100
Please go ahead.

01:02:42.100 --> 01:02:42.820
Luke, what's up?

01:02:42.820 --> 01:02:43.460
Luke.

01:02:43.460 --> 01:02:44.020
Hey.

01:02:44.020 --> 01:02:44.500
Hell yeah.

01:02:44.500 --> 01:02:44.820
Get casual with that mic.

01:02:44.820 --> 01:02:46.500
I really enjoy your question.

01:02:47.860 --> 01:02:48.420
Thank you.

01:02:48.420 --> 01:02:49.860
First of all, Luke Baker,

01:02:49.860 --> 01:02:51.540
sophomore at School of Mass Communication

01:02:51.540 --> 01:02:53.460
and Journalism at Texas State University.

01:02:53.460 --> 01:02:54.420
Yeah.

01:02:55.540 --> 01:02:56.900
Is this your LinkedIn?

01:02:56.900 --> 01:02:58.980
Yeah, but I gotta tell you,

01:02:58.980 --> 01:03:00.660
that shit's broken bad for us in the past.

01:03:00.660 --> 01:03:01.460
I thought you were going to be like,

01:03:01.460 --> 01:03:02.500
my SoundCloud is-

01:03:03.700 --> 01:03:05.220
Just ask the question, Luke.

01:03:05.220 --> 01:03:05.860
I will warn you,

01:03:05.860 --> 01:03:06.820
if you're about to do that,

01:03:06.820 --> 01:03:07.860
the last time it happened,

01:03:07.860 --> 01:03:09.380
the person was booed so hard

01:03:09.380 --> 01:03:10.980
they sunk into the mantle of the earth.

01:03:12.100 --> 01:03:13.620
Let that be a lesson to all of you.

01:03:13.620 --> 01:03:14.900
It was fucking brutal

01:03:14.900 --> 01:03:16.500
and I loved every second of it.

01:03:18.340 --> 01:03:19.940
We will do nothing to stop it.

01:03:19.940 --> 01:03:23.060
We will do nothing to stop it.

01:03:23.060 --> 01:03:24.260
Thank you for warning me.

01:03:25.540 --> 01:03:27.300
So my question is,

01:03:28.020 --> 01:03:29.060
what is charcuterie?

01:03:33.140 --> 01:03:33.640
Because-

01:03:34.980 --> 01:03:37.220
You don't need to clarify beyond the earlier-

01:03:37.220 --> 01:03:38.820
I would be interested to see why.

01:03:40.500 --> 01:03:42.020
That word's been kind of haunting me

01:03:42.020 --> 01:03:42.900
for the past month.

01:03:43.540 --> 01:03:45.380
I've just heard it so many times.

01:03:46.180 --> 01:03:46.580
Where?

01:03:48.340 --> 01:03:49.540
Just like in passing-

01:03:49.540 --> 01:03:50.420
Menus though, right?

01:03:50.420 --> 01:03:50.920
Right?

01:03:52.820 --> 01:03:54.660
Not just like on park benches and stuff.

01:03:55.540 --> 01:03:56.040
I don't-

01:03:56.040 --> 01:03:58.100
Dude, just like in casual conversation,

01:03:58.100 --> 01:03:59.780
I've never really had the heart to like,

01:03:59.780 --> 01:04:00.500
be like,

01:04:00.500 --> 01:04:01.380
okay, what is that?

01:04:01.380 --> 01:04:02.500
So I figured you guys would-

01:04:02.500 --> 01:04:03.700
Do you have any,

01:04:04.420 --> 01:04:05.380
any gl-

01:04:05.380 --> 01:04:07.220
Don't you fucking lie to me, Luke.

01:04:07.220 --> 01:04:09.460
How much do you actually know about charcuterie?

01:04:10.980 --> 01:04:12.180
Literally nothing at all.

01:04:12.180 --> 01:04:13.060
Okay, Luke.

01:04:13.940 --> 01:04:15.140
Let me take a crack at it.

01:04:15.140 --> 01:04:16.260
It's cheese and meat.

01:04:16.260 --> 01:04:16.500
All right.

01:04:17.220 --> 01:04:20.180
Well, but also sometimes it could be almonds

01:04:20.180 --> 01:04:22.260
and it can be almonds and it could be a pickle

01:04:22.260 --> 01:04:24.260
and it could be jam of some sort.

01:04:24.260 --> 01:04:25.380
Honeycomb is sometimes on there.

01:04:25.380 --> 01:04:26.900
It can be crusty bread.

01:04:26.900 --> 01:04:30.340
I think it's whatever the fuck they got laying around.

01:04:30.340 --> 01:04:30.900
Yeah.

01:04:30.900 --> 01:04:33.220
It's a fancy word for leftovers.

01:04:34.900 --> 01:04:36.500
That are easy to make.

01:04:36.500 --> 01:04:38.420
If it took work to make little ones,

01:04:38.420 --> 01:04:40.820
that's an appetizer or an hors d'oeuvre.

01:04:41.460 --> 01:04:45.380
If they just cut up something from Pepperidge Farm,

01:04:45.380 --> 01:04:45.620
that-

01:04:45.620 --> 01:04:47.460
You got charcuterie going, my friend.

01:04:47.460 --> 01:04:50.020
What's the one with the little vegetables?

01:04:50.020 --> 01:04:50.820
What's that called?

01:04:50.820 --> 01:04:52.340
A plate of little vegetables is called-

01:04:52.340 --> 01:04:53.140
Crudite.

01:04:53.140 --> 01:04:53.620
Crudite.

01:04:53.620 --> 01:04:54.420
Crudite.

01:04:54.420 --> 01:04:56.100
Crudite is vegetables.

01:04:56.100 --> 01:04:57.140
Charcuterie is cheese and meat.

01:04:57.140 --> 01:04:59.380
Charcuterie has vegetables on it too sometimes.

01:04:59.380 --> 01:05:00.420
Listen, let's dial in.

01:05:01.140 --> 01:05:02.500
Let's start with what isn't.

01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:03.700
What isn't charcuterie?

01:05:03.700 --> 01:05:04.980
A car, a truck.

01:05:04.980 --> 01:05:06.340
A child's laughter.

01:05:06.340 --> 01:05:07.060
Child's laughter.

01:05:07.060 --> 01:05:07.940
That's where we breathe.

01:05:07.940 --> 01:05:08.820
The stage I'm sitting on.

01:05:08.820 --> 01:05:10.180
A dream of your grandparents.

01:05:10.180 --> 01:05:10.900
Yes.

01:05:10.900 --> 01:05:12.500
A memory of summer's past.

01:05:13.380 --> 01:05:14.100
These things-

01:05:14.100 --> 01:05:15.300
Well, wait.

01:05:15.300 --> 01:05:17.300
A memory of summer's past could be charcuterie.

01:05:17.300 --> 01:05:19.700
Yeah, my grandma made the death of charcuterie.

01:05:19.700 --> 01:05:21.860
Also, your grandparents might've dreamed of charcuterie.

01:05:21.860 --> 01:05:22.180
I don't know-

01:05:22.180 --> 01:05:24.180
And a child might be laughing at charcuterie.

01:05:24.180 --> 01:05:24.500
Okay.

01:05:25.620 --> 01:05:27.780
That's some funny charcuterie they'd say.

01:05:27.780 --> 01:05:32.260
When a bread becomes too hard to safely consume,

01:05:32.260 --> 01:05:33.700
it is now charcuterie.

01:05:33.700 --> 01:05:39.620
When a thin meat is deemed too flavorless,

01:05:39.620 --> 01:05:40.820
it has become charcuterie.

01:05:40.820 --> 01:05:42.020
And room temperature.

01:05:42.020 --> 01:05:44.900
When a cheese has been deemed to be too flavorful,

01:05:45.860 --> 01:05:46.980
now it's charcuterie.

01:05:46.980 --> 01:05:48.100
Are you following me?

01:05:48.100 --> 01:05:49.220
I get it.

01:05:49.220 --> 01:05:49.940
There's imagine...

01:05:50.820 --> 01:05:52.660
When you go and you have to work at a restaurant,

01:05:52.660 --> 01:05:54.100
you go get your food handler's license,

01:05:54.100 --> 01:05:56.020
you learn about the safe range of temperature.

01:05:56.020 --> 01:05:56.900
Yes, the danger zone.

01:05:56.900 --> 01:06:00.180
There's a secret gauge they don't tell you about,

01:06:00.180 --> 01:06:02.420
and it is when does bread become so hard,

01:06:02.420 --> 01:06:03.780
now it's charcuterie, baby.

01:06:05.220 --> 01:06:06.900
And also, it should be clear,

01:06:06.900 --> 01:06:09.300
these can't be loose things.

01:06:09.300 --> 01:06:11.460
One piece of bread is not charcuterie.

01:06:11.460 --> 01:06:13.460
One piece of cheese is not charcuterie.

01:06:13.460 --> 01:06:14.660
One piece of meat, no.

01:06:14.660 --> 01:06:16.820
Put it all in the same area.

01:06:16.820 --> 01:06:18.420
Maybe it's like a hunk of wood.

01:06:18.420 --> 01:06:20.100
Or maybe it's a stone slab.

01:06:20.100 --> 01:06:21.620
Maybe it's someone's face.

01:06:21.620 --> 01:06:22.340
I don't know.

01:06:22.340 --> 01:06:23.620
Now it's charcuterie.

01:06:23.620 --> 01:06:25.620
Another big determining factor.

01:06:25.620 --> 01:06:28.100
If it costs $30, that's a charcuterie.

01:06:28.100 --> 01:06:29.220
That's a charcuterie.

01:06:30.500 --> 01:06:31.780
If it's complimentary...

01:06:32.420 --> 01:06:35.700
The $6 offering at Applebee's is a ham party.

01:06:38.500 --> 01:06:40.900
Or, as it's called on the menu, a ham slam.

01:06:40.900 --> 01:06:41.860
A ham slam.

01:06:43.220 --> 01:06:44.100
That explains so much,

01:06:44.100 --> 01:06:45.940
because the reason I was pitching myself earlier

01:06:45.940 --> 01:06:47.460
is because I'm not worth $30 yet.

01:06:47.460 --> 01:06:48.500
So...

01:06:48.500 --> 01:06:49.000
Yes.

01:06:49.780 --> 01:06:51.780
No, no, no, don't all that.

01:06:51.780 --> 01:06:53.300
That's a fucking goal.

01:06:53.300 --> 01:06:54.500
That's an aspiration.

01:06:55.060 --> 01:06:56.900
I remember the first time I ate charcuterie,

01:06:56.900 --> 01:07:00.020
I went, oh, that cheese is...

01:07:00.020 --> 01:07:00.520
Wow.

01:07:01.060 --> 01:07:02.820
I went, taste that, taste that, taste that.

01:07:02.820 --> 01:07:05.060
It's really pungent, huh?

01:07:05.060 --> 01:07:06.100
But I've made it.

01:07:06.100 --> 01:07:08.180
Because it was $30 that I had.

01:07:08.180 --> 01:07:08.820
That's the thing.

01:07:09.380 --> 01:07:13.220
Charcuterie is like the noted excess of food.

01:07:13.220 --> 01:07:14.260
Because it's literally like, hey,

01:07:14.260 --> 01:07:16.180
do you want a delicious appetizer?

01:07:16.180 --> 01:07:18.820
Or like a plate of actual food you're gonna eat?

01:07:18.820 --> 01:07:19.700
No, no.

01:07:19.700 --> 01:07:22.420
Give me a big hunk of wood with some leavens on it.

01:07:22.420 --> 01:07:22.820
Sure.

01:07:22.820 --> 01:07:23.780
For $30!

01:07:23.780 --> 01:07:24.580
For $30.

01:07:24.580 --> 01:07:26.500
If you run, if you own a...

01:07:26.500 --> 01:07:28.180
I know this is a food scene, Austin.

01:07:28.180 --> 01:07:29.220
I know it because I live here.

01:07:29.220 --> 01:07:31.380
If you're a restaurateur, restaurant owner,

01:07:31.940 --> 01:07:33.780
please Christ do this,

01:07:33.780 --> 01:07:36.420
because it's the best idea I've ever had in my life.

01:07:36.420 --> 01:07:38.260
If your restaurant sells charcuterie,

01:07:38.820 --> 01:07:40.020
and it costs $30,

01:07:40.020 --> 01:07:42.500
it's got flavorless ham and stinky cheese on it.

01:07:43.940 --> 01:07:46.100
It should also come with a sticker that said,

01:07:46.100 --> 01:07:47.540
I had charcuterie today.

01:07:53.700 --> 01:07:54.900
They put that on you.

01:07:56.100 --> 01:07:59.460
You go to any job interview in the fucking city.

01:08:00.660 --> 01:08:02.020
What are your qualifications?

01:08:03.140 --> 01:08:05.140
I have $30 to throw around.

01:08:07.220 --> 01:08:11.300
My teeth are hard enough to chew through the firmest breads.

01:08:13.060 --> 01:08:14.260
Luke, does that help?

01:08:14.260 --> 01:08:15.300
That helps me immensely.

01:08:15.300 --> 01:08:16.260
Thank you so much, guys.

01:08:16.260 --> 01:08:17.060
Thank you, Luke.

01:08:17.060 --> 01:08:18.340
All right, and thank you.

01:08:18.340 --> 01:08:19.300
Yeah, we got one more.

01:08:20.500 --> 01:08:21.060
Yes.

01:08:21.060 --> 01:08:21.460
Hello.

01:08:22.260 --> 01:08:23.060
Hi.

01:08:23.060 --> 01:08:24.020
Hey, what's your name?

01:08:24.020 --> 01:08:24.420
Camille.

01:08:24.420 --> 01:08:25.140
Hi, Camille.

01:08:25.140 --> 01:08:25.780
Camille.

01:08:25.780 --> 01:08:30.420
Hi, so my question, I guess, was,

01:08:30.420 --> 01:08:32.180
at work a while ago,

01:08:32.180 --> 01:08:35.140
we were all kind of reminiscing about how fun college was

01:08:35.140 --> 01:08:36.820
and fun stuff we do with our friends.

01:08:36.820 --> 01:08:40.340
And I told my coworkers about the inside joke,

01:08:40.340 --> 01:08:41.220
me and my best friend,

01:08:41.220 --> 01:08:42.580
who we lived together for three years,

01:08:42.580 --> 01:08:45.140
had where when one person would come home,

01:08:45.140 --> 01:08:47.620
whoever was already at home would pretend they had died.

01:08:48.580 --> 01:08:52.020
And when you find your best friend's dead body,

01:08:52.020 --> 01:08:54.820
you have to react like you fell, excuse me,

01:08:54.820 --> 01:08:56.660
found and murdered.

01:08:56.660 --> 01:08:58.740
Camille got worked up for a second.

01:08:58.740 --> 01:09:00.900
It's hilarious.

01:09:00.900 --> 01:09:01.540
Yeah, sure.

01:09:02.900 --> 01:09:05.380
My coworkers did get really weird though.

01:09:05.380 --> 01:09:06.660
Well, because here's-

01:09:06.660 --> 01:09:08.420
No, what's your question?

01:09:09.220 --> 01:09:11.540
I just, I know they think it's weird,

01:09:11.540 --> 01:09:12.980
but they tried to laugh it off like,

01:09:12.980 --> 01:09:14.820
oh, yeah.

01:09:15.860 --> 01:09:18.340
Was that also because human beings are awkward?

01:09:19.220 --> 01:09:20.980
Oh, yeah.

01:09:23.060 --> 01:09:24.180
Camille, let me say this.

01:09:24.180 --> 01:09:25.620
I don't think the game itself is weird,

01:09:25.620 --> 01:09:27.300
but the thing that struck me about it

01:09:27.940 --> 01:09:31.460
is the chance that you would get halfway through

01:09:31.460 --> 01:09:32.900
doing a very dramatic like,

01:09:32.900 --> 01:09:34.900
oh, oh no, oh God, wait.

01:09:36.420 --> 01:09:37.700
Oh, ah, fuck.

01:09:37.700 --> 01:09:41.940
Yeah, that's a game you win until you lose.

01:09:44.900 --> 01:09:46.500
And then you ain't gonna win it again.

01:09:47.940 --> 01:09:50.260
But you will get A's for the rest of the semester,

01:09:50.260 --> 01:09:50.980
which is nice.

01:09:54.020 --> 01:09:54.900
I've heard that.

01:09:54.900 --> 01:09:55.460
I don't know.

01:09:56.180 --> 01:09:57.940
I just heard it in a movie.

01:09:57.940 --> 01:10:00.020
I mean, it's like a fun game between us.

01:10:00.020 --> 01:10:00.900
We both know we're playing it.

01:10:00.900 --> 01:10:02.260
I'll say this more than once.

01:10:02.260 --> 01:10:04.980
In your defense, everybody here,

01:10:04.980 --> 01:10:07.140
when you heard about the rules of this game,

01:10:07.140 --> 01:10:09.700
you may say out loud, oh, ghoulish.

01:10:10.900 --> 01:10:12.900
I want everybody to just round of applause

01:10:12.900 --> 01:10:14.980
if your mind didn't immediately start racing

01:10:14.980 --> 01:10:16.820
of the scenarios you had concocted.

01:10:18.660 --> 01:10:19.060
Yes.

01:10:19.060 --> 01:10:19.940
Right.

01:10:19.940 --> 01:10:20.440
Yes.

01:10:21.060 --> 01:10:22.740
So maybe, Camille,

01:10:23.380 --> 01:10:25.700
the reason that your coworkers reacted like that

01:10:25.700 --> 01:10:27.220
is because they were distracted

01:10:27.220 --> 01:10:29.940
thinking about how they would fake being dead later.

01:10:29.940 --> 01:10:32.180
Yeah, how they wish they had done it

01:10:32.180 --> 01:10:33.380
because it sounds fun.

01:10:33.380 --> 01:10:33.880
Yeah.

01:10:33.880 --> 01:10:39.000
Oh, I would just wrap myself up in mummy stuff.

01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:42.840
That would get a good scare, wouldn't it?

01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:45.240
I would put a whole pile of me

01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:46.680
underneath a magician's trick.

01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:48.360
Like the prestige.

01:10:55.720 --> 01:10:57.400
You got me again, Justin.

01:10:57.400 --> 01:11:00.040
It's a lot of expense and it's worth every penny.

01:11:00.040 --> 01:11:03.400
I'm going to have to talk to Nikolai Tesla.

01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:06.920
I would get one of my bones out of my body

01:11:08.360 --> 01:11:11.640
and just sort of put it on the kitchen counter

01:11:12.520 --> 01:11:15.080
and then stay at a hotel for a month.

01:11:16.280 --> 01:11:18.280
I would slowly, over many months,

01:11:18.280 --> 01:11:20.120
collect some pints of my own blood

01:11:21.240 --> 01:11:24.120
until I have enough to fill the whole house.

01:11:24.120 --> 01:11:28.120
I would stab myself with a knife, but a bat stab.

01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:30.040
Wait, bat in...

01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:31.160
That looked good.

01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:33.320
That looked like, oh, he dead.

01:11:33.320 --> 01:11:36.040
But I wouldn't be dead and it would just be...

01:11:36.040 --> 01:11:37.080
I would miss the liver by an inch.

01:11:37.080 --> 01:11:39.000
I would kill my twin.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:39.500
Yes.

01:11:42.200 --> 01:11:43.160
Androids.

01:11:44.120 --> 01:11:44.680
That's the end.

01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:46.280
Camille, does that help?

01:11:47.320 --> 01:11:48.120
Your game kicks ass.

01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:48.680
Congratulations.

01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:49.480
Congratulations, Camille.

01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:49.720
Thank you.

01:11:49.720 --> 01:11:50.280
Your game is awesome.

01:11:51.080 --> 01:11:52.920
And you, Austin, are awesome.

01:11:52.920 --> 01:11:54.600
Thank you so much for being so kind to us.

01:11:55.400 --> 01:11:56.120
We really appreciate it.

01:11:56.120 --> 01:11:56.760
You can turn the lights off.

01:11:56.760 --> 01:11:59.800
You can turn the lights off because it's terrifying.

01:11:59.800 --> 01:12:01.400
You want to shut them off?

01:12:01.400 --> 01:12:02.360
Couple of things real quick.

01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:03.720
First, if you haven't already,

01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:06.920
there's posters out on the lobby that...

01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:10.200
Listen, we have a lot of really amazing designers

01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:13.080
that we work with for the live shows.

01:12:13.080 --> 01:12:14.120
This is one of the...

01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:16.760
It's fucking so good.

01:12:16.760 --> 01:12:20.120
They did a great job and you should support her.

01:12:20.120 --> 01:12:21.480
Similarly, there's some copies,

01:12:21.480 --> 01:12:22.760
if you haven't got one already,

01:12:22.760 --> 01:12:25.560
of both the Adventure Zone graphic novel book one

01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:28.040
and the Sawbones book out in the lobby.

01:12:28.040 --> 01:12:28.360
Maybe.

01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:29.640
They're signed.

01:12:30.760 --> 01:12:32.600
So if you want to check those out, you can do that.

01:12:32.600 --> 01:12:33.160
Thank you to...

01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:36.040
I was commenting on this backstage.

01:12:36.040 --> 01:12:38.040
I do not know that I've ever performed on a stage

01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:41.400
where I have seen so many shows beforehand.

01:12:41.400 --> 01:12:44.920
This theater and ACL in general fucking rules this city.

01:12:44.920 --> 01:12:46.440
It's so lucky to have it.

01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:51.160
I am lucky to...

01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:52.760
I'm lucky to live in Austin because of this place.

01:12:52.760 --> 01:12:54.840
I've seen more concerts here than any other place in my life.

01:12:54.840 --> 01:12:57.080
So the fact that we're performing on the stage is buck wild.

01:12:57.080 --> 01:12:57.880
It's a beautiful theater.

01:12:57.880 --> 01:12:59.000
Thank you all so much for having us.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.080
Thank you to American hero, Paul Sabourin.

01:13:01.080 --> 01:13:02.200
Thank you to Paul.

01:13:02.200 --> 01:13:02.440
Paul.

01:13:04.440 --> 01:13:07.000
Please enjoy the music of Paul and Storm.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.400
Thank you Rock on Tour, Clint McElroy.

01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:11.240
Yeah, for your great work.

01:13:11.880 --> 01:13:14.680
Thanks to Wonderful, a fantastic podcast

01:13:15.560 --> 01:13:18.520
that you should enjoy if you do not already.

01:13:19.400 --> 01:13:22.040
And thank you to our various family members

01:13:22.040 --> 01:13:25.160
who weren't included in the two previous things we just said

01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:27.640
for being here to support us and travel with us

01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:28.360
and do the shows and everything.

01:13:28.360 --> 01:13:29.480
I have one last one.

01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:33.400
Every year our listeners get together

01:13:33.400 --> 01:13:36.600
and there's this list called Empty Stockings

01:13:36.600 --> 01:13:37.880
that Huntington, West Virginia,

01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:39.720
newspaper Herald & Spatch puts out.

01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:41.800
And it is all the people who have things

01:13:41.800 --> 01:13:44.600
that they wishes for Christmas

01:13:44.600 --> 01:13:46.520
for kids that aren't going to have anything.

01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:49.160
And every year our listeners look at that list

01:13:49.160 --> 01:13:50.680
and burn it to the ground.

01:13:50.680 --> 01:13:52.040
They fucking destroy it.

01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:53.000
Generosity.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.160
And that was a weird way of putting it.

01:13:55.160 --> 01:13:57.320
But if you can help with that.

01:13:57.320 --> 01:13:59.400
I'm going to fuck that list up.

01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:00.920
If you can help with that,

01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:04.600
MBAMangels.com is the place to go.

01:14:04.600 --> 01:14:05.560
You can claim a gift.

01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:06.680
You can donate money.

01:14:06.680 --> 01:14:08.680
Whatever you can do really means a lot.

01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:10.120
When we say wish list,

01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:12.920
we mean stuff like they need socks.

01:14:12.920 --> 01:14:14.360
Yeah, socks or a mattress or stuff.

01:14:14.360 --> 01:14:15.400
I wasn't going to get into it

01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:16.440
because it's kind of like a live show

01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:17.960
and I want everybody to have a great time.

01:14:17.960 --> 01:14:20.040
But yeah, I mean, it is very sad.

01:14:20.040 --> 01:14:20.680
Thank you, Travis.

01:14:20.680 --> 01:14:21.400
Poverty is sad.

01:14:21.400 --> 01:14:23.160
Hey, who wants a final Yahoo?

01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:24.520
It's a real ripper.

01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:25.960
Yeah, fart it out, bud.

01:14:28.840 --> 01:14:29.400
We thanked everyone.

01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:30.200
John Roderick.

01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:31.240
John Roderick and Max Fun.

01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:31.960
Y'all got it.

01:14:31.960 --> 01:14:32.920
Good work, y'all.

01:14:32.920 --> 01:14:36.440
Let's rip it up with a funny fucking final Yahoo, baby.

01:14:42.040 --> 01:14:43.960

Thank you, James.

01:14:44.920 --> 01:14:46.440
It's Yahoo Anonymous.

01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:47.400
Yeah, Yahoo.

01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:50.120
So I'm going to call him Bill Asks.

01:14:51.640 --> 01:14:55.080
Is buying calcium enriched milk like bone insurance?

01:14:57.480 --> 01:14:58.920
My name is Justin McElroy.

01:14:58.920 --> 01:15:00.040
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:15:00.040 --> 01:15:00.840
I'm Griffin McElroy.

01:15:00.840 --> 01:15:01.800

Hey, it's Janet Varney of the JV Club podcast, and I am so excited to be joining Maximum Fun.

01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:38.200
If you're not yet familiar with the JV Club, it's a podcast with me and some of my favorite women

01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:43.320
and, in the summer, men, as we explore the highs and lows of our terrible teenage years

01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:45.640
into our adult lessons.

01:15:45.640 --> 01:15:50.840
For example, hear about Alison Breeze's humiliating moment at a gymnastics competition,

01:15:50.840 --> 01:15:56.600
experience the shame of a knocked-out tooth with Jamila Jamil, or drop in as Jon Hamm

01:15:56.600 --> 01:15:59.800
imagines what would happen if Bambi met Godzilla.

01:15:59.800 --> 01:16:04.200
So join me and all my once-awkward, often-still-awkward friends every Thursday

01:16:04.200 --> 01:16:22.200
by subscribing to the JV Club on Maximumfun.org.
