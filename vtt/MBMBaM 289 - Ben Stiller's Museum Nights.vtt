00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:51.040
Hello everyone, and welcome to this very special episode of My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

00:52.080 --> 00:58.320
My name is Justin McElroy. My name is Travis McElroy. I'm Griffin McElroy. We come to you

00:58.320 --> 01:09.920
after what many are calling the hug heard around the world. Last night, two teams met on the field

01:09.920 --> 01:17.680
of athletic competition preparing for the biggest sporting event of the year. The Carolina Panthers

01:17.680 --> 01:26.240
and the Denver Broncos lined up against each other and then, apropos of nothing, before the first

01:26.240 --> 01:32.880
ball had been thrown. Or kicked. Or kicked. Or rolled. Or rolled. Sometimes they just roll it.

01:32.880 --> 01:36.240
That's a good trick play, by the way. That's a good thing. High school football coaches,

01:36.240 --> 01:39.520
you just roll the ball and I'm just like, what do I do? Sorry, go on. Can I please finish this story?

01:42.160 --> 01:45.440
Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning crossed the line of scrimmage,

01:46.080 --> 01:52.160
illegal, not just in terms of sports rules. Yeah, not allowed to do that. But an actual crime.

01:52.160 --> 01:57.600
Listen, the scrimmage line is there for a reason. And he walked across the line of scrimmage to

01:57.600 --> 02:04.000
opposing quarterback Cam Newton. It was quarterback v. quarterback. It was in a rare play, quarterback

02:04.000 --> 02:10.880
v. quarterback. Well, they were in the multi-ball bonus round. They set the ball aside and simply

02:11.760 --> 02:17.280
embraced the crowd. I think my favorite part was as you watched the transition on Cam Newton's face

02:17.280 --> 02:22.000
is he was like, what are you doing, man? What are you doing? So right. And then he

02:22.000 --> 02:29.040
just like got it. Yeah. And that's how I felt watching at home was I get it. And it was like

02:29.040 --> 02:35.600
we were all hugging Cam Newton. It was like all of us were hugging each other simultaneously.

02:35.600 --> 02:40.000
I felt so connected to everybody. And they just called the game right there.

02:40.000 --> 02:46.640
I spilled a Coke all over my friend Johnny because we hugged, but I was holding a Coke in my hands

02:46.640 --> 02:50.800
and it just got all over him. And then I realized the cameras were filming us. And this was actually

02:50.800 --> 02:57.120
a Coca-Cola commercial I was in. I felt like I was embracing everybody on earth at the same.

02:57.120 --> 03:03.200
I was embracing Donald Trump. I was embracing Kim Jong Un and Kim Jong Dose and the whole family.

03:03.200 --> 03:08.880
The whole set. The whole set of Kim Jongs, all of them. We were all embracing as one people.

03:08.880 --> 03:13.280
And it was kicked off because two men, it was like, what if they threw a football war and

03:13.280 --> 03:18.080
nobody came? And those two people- And they were finally able to set aside their differences.

03:18.080 --> 03:19.600
Yeah, exactly.

03:19.600 --> 03:24.000
I felt like I was, you know what, Justin? I felt like I was hugging myself. I was finally

03:24.000 --> 03:30.800
able to forgive myself for everything. For all of my crimes against humanity.

03:30.800 --> 03:38.800
It almost made me forget about the game itself in which Cam Newton and his good,

03:38.800 --> 03:45.120
good passing just completely dunked up on that big old dinosaur Peyton Manning and how hard that

03:45.120 --> 03:49.760
he lost. And then he cried because it was the last game of his career and he lost it so fucking bad.

03:49.760 --> 03:51.200
He lost it super bad.

03:51.200 --> 03:52.000
He lost it super bad.

03:52.000 --> 03:52.400
Why is he dying?

03:52.400 --> 03:54.960
It was my last one.

03:54.960 --> 03:59.760
And he cried and cried and cried. The crying tears of an old, old man. And I was like,

03:59.760 --> 04:00.720
fuck, Peyto.

04:01.920 --> 04:06.320
See, I saw the hug for 20 seconds and I figured the game would not be held. I turned it off.

04:06.320 --> 04:07.280
No, they still did it.

04:07.280 --> 04:11.520
They still did it. They didn't televise it though, which was weird. Griffin was at the game.

04:11.520 --> 04:15.520
Yeah. Peyto got posterized. He got dunked upon. It was weird.

04:15.520 --> 04:21.200
I, the way I heard it, they just hugged the entire time. And then like all, like the water,

04:21.840 --> 04:25.840
the hydration specialists, as they say, the water boy, they all hugged.

04:25.840 --> 04:30.160
And then after about like an hour and a half, Coldplay came to the middle of the field.

04:30.160 --> 04:35.120
They're like, oh right. Okay. So like, are we still going to do this show or what?

04:35.120 --> 04:36.400
Or is everybody just going to hug?

04:36.400 --> 04:40.000
And then Bruno Mars hugs Coldplay and they were like, don't you do this, man.

04:40.000 --> 04:40.560
Don't you do this.

04:40.560 --> 04:42.160
Don't you do this to me.

04:42.160 --> 04:43.840
It's not your fault, Coldplay.

04:43.840 --> 04:45.680
Don't you do this to me, Bruno Mars.

04:46.240 --> 04:47.120
It's not your fault.

04:49.680 --> 04:51.040
It was all yellow.

04:51.040 --> 04:53.360
Hey, hey, look at me. I'd catch a grenade for you.

04:59.600 --> 05:00.560
That's Chris Martin.

05:00.560 --> 05:03.840
In case you're curious, that's what it sounds like with Chris Martin crying.

05:04.400 --> 05:07.760
And also every record Coldplay has ever released. It sounds like that too.

05:07.760 --> 05:10.640
Yellow.

05:10.640 --> 05:13.120
Do you guys remember when we used to predict the Super Bowl

05:13.120 --> 05:19.920
by putting the literal team animal or beings in a room together

05:19.920 --> 05:21.360
and having them fight to the death?

05:21.360 --> 05:25.200
Like one time it was the Cardinals and something else.

05:25.200 --> 05:30.640
And we talked about like a bunch of popes just like fucking with machetes

05:30.640 --> 05:32.880
taking on some Seahawks or something.

05:32.880 --> 05:35.200
This is something we talked about on My Brother, My Brother, Me?

05:35.200 --> 05:35.520
Yeah.

05:35.520 --> 05:36.240
Something we did?

05:36.240 --> 05:40.480
So you just like welcome everybody to the My Brother, My Brother, Me fancast,

05:40.480 --> 05:41.600
My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

05:41.600 --> 05:45.040
Well, no, I'm saying let's get into it.

05:45.040 --> 05:46.880
No, because this is a great question.

05:46.880 --> 05:47.840
It's not a great question.

05:47.840 --> 05:48.800
No, shut up and listen.

05:49.360 --> 05:51.040
I haven't even gotten to the fucking question yet.

05:51.040 --> 05:51.440
Okay.

05:51.440 --> 05:53.760
10 big beautiful horses.

05:53.760 --> 05:55.600
Clydesdales? We talking Clydesdales?

05:55.600 --> 05:58.240
Yeah, I think those would qualify as Broncos.

05:58.240 --> 06:01.360
I think a Bronco is also a little bit fucking loco.

06:01.360 --> 06:03.520
They buck as I understand.

06:03.520 --> 06:08.080
They got that going for them versus 10 Panthers in a room

06:08.720 --> 06:11.440
just big enough to hold all 20 of these animals.

06:11.440 --> 06:14.240
It's like a fucked up redundant Noah's Ark.

06:15.040 --> 06:16.560
Well, the problem, Griff, is-

06:16.560 --> 06:18.400
Who's coming out that cage?

06:18.400 --> 06:20.720
Your Panther is a stealth killer.

06:20.720 --> 06:21.040
Yeah.

06:21.040 --> 06:21.680
Right?

06:21.680 --> 06:24.560
They're not really like your straight up fair fight.

06:25.120 --> 06:29.600
They're more of like a pounce on you from the tree or some kind of canopy.

06:29.600 --> 06:32.640
Whereas your Bronco, that's just a straight up murderer.

06:32.640 --> 06:36.640
So I think they're going to stamp on them.

06:36.640 --> 06:37.840
They're going to champ on them.

06:38.800 --> 06:40.160
Champ on them?

06:40.160 --> 06:40.480
Yeah.

06:40.480 --> 06:42.800
You know how they champ at the bit?

06:43.920 --> 06:45.360
They're going to champ on them.

06:45.360 --> 06:46.880
Are you just saying chomp, but bad?

06:46.880 --> 06:47.600
No, champ.

06:47.600 --> 06:48.640
Horses champ.

06:48.640 --> 06:49.680
Horses champ at the bit.

06:49.680 --> 06:50.480
Horses champ.

06:51.040 --> 06:54.640
Yeah, but I think there's something to be said about how much sharp stuff is on a Panther.

06:54.640 --> 06:55.760
There's a lot of sharp-

06:55.760 --> 07:01.840
There's at least probably 30 sharp things on any given Panther.

07:01.840 --> 07:03.440
And they're under quills.

07:03.440 --> 07:04.720
And they have those under quills.

07:05.600 --> 07:07.120
Do you think it's weird?

07:08.240 --> 07:11.280
Do you know how good Peyton Manning must be at football?

07:11.280 --> 07:14.240
That he is A, so old.

07:14.240 --> 07:14.560
100.

07:14.560 --> 07:20.800
And B, his backup is a guy that literally has the name of the team in his name.

07:20.800 --> 07:22.960
His name is Bronco Swiler.

07:22.960 --> 07:24.240
His name is in there.

07:24.800 --> 07:26.960
Quarterback of the Broncos, Bronco Swiler.

07:27.680 --> 07:28.480
That's right there.

07:29.040 --> 07:30.240
You must be so good at football.

07:30.240 --> 07:33.360
Because I'd love to be able to say Broncos Bronco Swiler.

07:33.360 --> 07:33.760
That'd make a lot more-

07:33.760 --> 07:35.680
I love how you pronounce his name.

07:35.680 --> 07:36.160
Well, you've got to say-

07:36.160 --> 07:37.840
It's one weird word.

07:37.840 --> 07:42.080
If you don't say Bronco Swiler, then it's like you lose the joke.

07:42.080 --> 07:44.400
It's got to sound like Bronco, Bronco Swiler.

07:44.400 --> 07:45.600
This has all been amazing.

07:46.240 --> 07:47.440
Really fucking, yeah.

07:47.440 --> 07:51.040
I want to say one more really important thing about the Denver Broncos.

07:51.680 --> 07:55.440
Travis Griffin, everybody listening at home, if it's safe for you right now,

07:56.080 --> 07:59.200
call up a picture of the logo of the Denver Broncos for a second.

07:59.200 --> 07:59.840
I'll check it.

07:59.840 --> 08:00.880
Just go ahead and pull it up.

08:00.880 --> 08:03.280
I'll give you, let's call it three seconds because I've been-

08:03.280 --> 08:04.560
I can do it in my head.

08:04.560 --> 08:07.280
One thousand one, one thousand two, one thousand three.

08:07.280 --> 08:13.280
Okay, I understand that you have to spice it up every few years

08:13.280 --> 08:15.360
and really make it sleeker.

08:15.360 --> 08:16.400
But in trying to make-

08:16.400 --> 08:17.840
Yeah, they've taken it, yeah.

08:17.840 --> 08:18.080
No, they've taken it too far.

08:18.080 --> 08:23.600
In trying to make it so aesthetically sleek and give this illusion of movement,

08:23.600 --> 08:28.080
they have drawn a logo of somebody pulling a horse's head off its body.

08:28.080 --> 08:31.280
That is, right now, this horse has-

08:31.280 --> 08:34.000
The reason it's stretched out like that and the reason there's no body

08:34.000 --> 08:36.080
is that it just got pulled off a horse's body.

08:36.080 --> 08:37.200
It's disgusting.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.760
Just put a picture of a horsey on there.

08:39.760 --> 08:40.480
It's not hard.

08:41.120 --> 08:46.160
How about just a big muscular horse thumbs upping to you and be like, good football.

08:46.160 --> 08:48.720
Yeah, see, that's what's getting lost here is that I love it

08:48.720 --> 08:51.120
when a horse is just fucking diesel.

08:51.120 --> 08:51.600
You know what I mean?

08:51.600 --> 08:58.080
I love it when, listen, God's never made a mistake in the horse world.

08:58.080 --> 08:58.640
You know what I mean?

08:58.640 --> 09:02.160
What if he was a super diesel horse with a cowboy hat

09:02.160 --> 09:03.840
and he was kind of tipping it to you

09:03.840 --> 09:07.520
and he had a sweet ass huge cigar dangling out of his mouth?

09:07.520 --> 09:07.760
Yeah, that would be sick.

09:07.760 --> 09:10.000
And you could just tell that he was a super cool dude.

09:10.000 --> 09:14.880
See, you're losing the musculature in this fucked up, stretched out, torn off horse head.

09:14.880 --> 09:21.600
And honestly, it looks like a snake or maybe like a dinosaur with neck plates.

09:21.600 --> 09:22.480
It's fucking bad.

09:24.640 --> 09:27.200
Last note, the Atlanta Falcons have always had

09:27.200 --> 09:30.000
and will always have the best logo in professional sports.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.720
Yeah, it looks like a superhero logo.

09:32.720 --> 09:33.920
Fucking so sweet.

09:33.920 --> 09:34.560
It's so rad.

09:34.560 --> 09:36.640
And I don't really like the redesign from O3, but anyway.

09:37.760 --> 09:40.080
So this has been our sports show, my brother, my brother, me,

09:40.080 --> 09:43.200
and we are also this week gonna mix it up with some advice.

09:43.200 --> 09:45.600
Our sports show, all the pretty horses.

09:45.600 --> 09:47.360
Our sports show horse review.

09:50.880 --> 09:54.800
We obviously have not seen the big game as we were forced to say legally,

09:55.920 --> 09:57.920
but I'm sure we had a great time.

09:58.960 --> 10:02.720
I'm predicting three defensive touchdowns from the Denver Broncos.

10:02.720 --> 10:03.440
My boyfriend-

10:03.440 --> 10:06.080
I apologize, by the way, that I sound like Shang Tsung,

10:06.080 --> 10:09.600
the fucking emperor warlock from Mortal Kombat.

10:10.320 --> 10:11.600
I've tied one on last night.

10:11.600 --> 10:16.800
Professionalism, dedication, chastity.

10:16.800 --> 10:18.160
Read the question, you ding dong.

10:18.720 --> 10:22.400
My boyfriend likes to sit in the very front row of the movie theater.

10:22.400 --> 10:26.640
He has a film degree and insisted it's the best way to watch movies,

10:26.640 --> 10:29.840
even though everyone else tells him he is being a pain.

10:29.840 --> 10:32.960
He will only go for center seats if it's a 3D movie.

10:32.960 --> 10:34.000
That's legit.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.920
When we go to the movies in a group,

10:35.920 --> 10:38.400
his friends will leave us alone in the front

10:38.400 --> 10:40.160
so they can go sit in the center.

10:40.160 --> 10:43.040
How do I convince my boyfriend to sit in the people seats?

10:43.040 --> 10:45.360
That's from sore neck in central Florida.

10:45.360 --> 10:47.280
That is such a great way to think about it,

10:47.280 --> 10:49.920
because you're right, the seats in the front,

10:49.920 --> 10:51.120
those aren't people seats.

10:51.120 --> 10:52.240
Those are there as a joke.

10:53.360 --> 10:55.360
You know, when you get into a theater,

10:55.360 --> 10:59.040
I've been to a couple opening night,

11:00.560 --> 11:04.720
big time productions of movies and it's sold out

11:04.720 --> 11:07.360
and you get in and the only seats are in the front row

11:07.360 --> 11:10.880
and you're like, oh, well, I might as well leave.

11:10.880 --> 11:12.960
I would rather sit on someone's lap

11:12.960 --> 11:14.800
for the entirety of the movie

11:14.800 --> 11:16.800
than sit in the front row seats,

11:16.800 --> 11:19.120
because they're not actually there to be sat in.

11:19.120 --> 11:22.000
It's like a joke, like these are jokes.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.880
It is weird, it's just like, why do they,

11:24.880 --> 11:27.520
they shouldn't sell them, the theater's full.

11:27.520 --> 11:29.360
Like if that front row is the only row available,

11:29.360 --> 11:32.000
the theater is full, there's no place to sit.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.440
You can't sit anywhere.

11:33.440 --> 11:35.680
They leave that whole row of seats for Elijah,

11:35.680 --> 11:37.760
because he likes to stretch out.

11:37.760 --> 11:41.200
He likes to really, he puts up the armrests

11:41.200 --> 11:42.320
and he lays down some of the chairs

11:42.320 --> 11:43.600
and he just takes a little nap right there.

11:43.600 --> 11:46.640
Is there a professor at film school who's like,

11:46.640 --> 11:49.520
oh yeah, Susan Cain's great, now lean in everybody.

11:49.520 --> 11:50.640
I'm gonna tell you something

11:50.640 --> 11:52.640
they won't tell you in regular school.

11:52.640 --> 11:56.640
The best seats are in the front row.

11:56.640 --> 11:58.400
Keep that to yourself, be cool.

11:59.200 --> 12:00.400
That's what they don't tell you.

12:00.400 --> 12:03.040
It doesn't even make, it's a nonsensical argument

12:03.040 --> 12:08.560
and here is why, if you are, I refuse to believe

12:08.560 --> 12:10.640
that the entirety of the film industry

12:10.640 --> 12:16.800
has been making movies specifically to be best enjoyed

12:17.360 --> 12:18.240
by no one.

12:19.600 --> 12:22.240
Unless every film was shot from underneath

12:22.240 --> 12:24.080
the actors looking up at them.

12:24.080 --> 12:25.760
Yeah, what if it was like that?

12:25.760 --> 12:28.080
It was like those pictures where if you lean it enough

12:28.080 --> 12:29.360
it looks like Abraham Lincoln.

12:29.920 --> 12:32.240
You just get all the secret, like it all connects.

12:32.240 --> 12:35.760
Oh, that's such an amazing, so what would those movies,

12:36.320 --> 12:38.320
let's use Citizen Kane, let's use Jurassic Park.

12:39.280 --> 12:42.000
But it's just filmed like you're just like under

12:42.000 --> 12:43.520
and inside John Hammond.

12:44.640 --> 12:46.240
So from like row five it's like,

12:46.240 --> 12:48.560
this looks really stretched out and fucked up.

12:48.560 --> 12:49.920
I don't get, like it sounds like

12:49.920 --> 12:51.440
there's some sick dino action happening.

12:52.240 --> 12:53.760
But I can't see them.

12:53.760 --> 12:56.800
What sucks is actually if you watch Jurassic Park

12:56.800 --> 12:59.120
that's just sort of how Jeff Goldblum looks.

12:59.680 --> 13:01.920
So like when you do sit in the front row

13:01.920 --> 13:03.600
you get sort of a different Goldblum.

13:03.600 --> 13:06.240
Well you get a much more like Goldloom.

13:06.240 --> 13:08.880
He's like right over you and it's wonderful.

13:08.880 --> 13:11.360
It's what we all dream of happening all the time.

13:11.360 --> 13:13.840
Just being fucking dominated by Jeff Goldblum.

13:13.840 --> 13:14.960
You wanna know something weird?

13:14.960 --> 13:17.200
I just one time I went to a movie,

13:17.200 --> 13:20.400
I went to see Night of the Museum, the first one.

13:21.120 --> 13:22.480
Night of the Museum?

13:22.480 --> 13:24.160
Night at the Museum I believe it was.

13:24.720 --> 13:26.160
This is my night, the museum.

13:26.160 --> 13:26.960
This is my night.

13:27.520 --> 13:31.360
And something happened and to this day

13:31.360 --> 13:32.960
it still boggles my mind.

13:32.960 --> 13:35.360
They were playing it in the wrong format

13:35.360 --> 13:37.440
and I could see like the boom mic

13:37.440 --> 13:39.200
and the cables on the ground.

13:39.200 --> 13:40.240
No, you dream this.

13:40.240 --> 13:43.200
This is real before they clicked it over

13:43.200 --> 13:45.040
and then suddenly like the black bar

13:45.040 --> 13:47.600
at the top of the bottom covered the whole thing.

13:47.600 --> 13:49.840
No Travis, that's some Toy Story bullshit.

13:49.840 --> 13:52.240
You think all movies are actually being acted out

13:52.240 --> 13:53.600
in front of you every time you watched it.

13:53.600 --> 13:54.960
I swear to God this happened.

13:54.960 --> 13:58.000
The digi actors got sloppy in your version.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.600
This is a whole night, there's no fuck.

13:59.600 --> 14:03.040
So what you're imagining is maybe they filmed all of it

14:03.040 --> 14:05.600
but there's a guy that stands up near the projector window

14:05.600 --> 14:07.600
with two pieces of black construction paper.

14:07.600 --> 14:09.680
I'm saying maybe there's a switch on the projector

14:09.680 --> 14:14.560
that's like wide or your like full screen format.

14:15.360 --> 14:16.960
Guys, it was so fucked up.

14:16.960 --> 14:18.960
I was watching Night of the Museum

14:18.960 --> 14:22.000
and then Ben Stiller forgot his line and said line

14:22.000 --> 14:23.200
and it was like really quick.

14:24.320 --> 14:28.480
Listen, I also am not 100% sure this wasn't a dream.

14:28.480 --> 14:30.080
I'm just saying that this is a memory

14:30.080 --> 14:31.440
that I have in my brain.

14:31.440 --> 14:34.640
Hank Azaria in his tunic, his dick was hanging out

14:34.640 --> 14:36.880
for like a lot of the movie.

14:36.880 --> 14:40.080
Guys, Amy Adams fully Purple Rose of Cairode

14:40.080 --> 14:41.840
out of the screen and asked me to come

14:41.840 --> 14:44.160
and throw an incredible adventure is awesome.

14:45.200 --> 14:46.800
Wait, maybe that's why this person

14:46.800 --> 14:48.000
sits so close to the screen.

14:49.280 --> 14:51.200
No, maybe if you've gone to film school long enough

14:51.200 --> 14:54.640
you know that it's not every movie viewing

14:54.640 --> 14:56.320
but every 100th movie viewing

14:56.320 --> 15:00.560
you get one of these weird mutation versions of the film

15:00.560 --> 15:03.040
where you can enter into the picture.

15:03.040 --> 15:04.400
You can warp into it.

15:04.400 --> 15:06.240
You can last action hero it.

15:06.240 --> 15:08.640
Right, but you have to be sitting real close, right?

15:08.640 --> 15:10.400
Or Arnold's not gonna pick you.

15:10.400 --> 15:11.680
Maybe if you sit close enough

15:11.680 --> 15:14.800
you can see behind the giant black letter boxes

15:14.800 --> 15:16.960
that they raise and lower to cover.

15:16.960 --> 15:18.880
You can peek over and see the craft service table.

15:18.880 --> 15:19.680
Yeah, exactly.

15:20.240 --> 15:21.360
Travis, I have-

15:21.360 --> 15:23.600
That's the most mental thing you've ever said.

15:23.600 --> 15:27.520
I swear, it's like, I don't think I'm making it up.

15:27.520 --> 15:31.360
Can you form other memories like surrounding that?

15:31.360 --> 15:33.600
Can you summon up a memory of like you

15:33.600 --> 15:35.760
and who else was there or like what you did before?

15:37.120 --> 15:39.600
His mushrooms dealer was there.

15:42.640 --> 15:45.520
I can't remember anything else about the day.

15:45.520 --> 15:48.720
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

15:48.720 --> 15:50.240
Are you awake right now?

15:50.240 --> 15:51.840
Can we be sure about this?

15:51.840 --> 15:54.400
Can any of us be sure, Griffin?

15:54.400 --> 15:55.760
Oh God, not again.

15:55.760 --> 15:56.560
Do you guys want Yahoo?

15:59.120 --> 16:00.080
I have to know.

16:00.080 --> 16:01.600
I have one other question, Travis.

16:03.920 --> 16:07.600
When you have dwelled...

16:07.600 --> 16:10.480
Okay, first off, I cannot believe we're nearly 300 episodes

16:10.480 --> 16:13.920
before you dropped this fucking omega bomb on us.

16:13.920 --> 16:16.000
Firstly, the craziest thing you've ever said

16:16.000 --> 16:17.440
on this entire program.

16:17.440 --> 16:19.600
I cannot believe you waited this long to deploy this.

16:19.600 --> 16:20.160
That's one.

16:20.160 --> 16:22.960
But maybe it needed this much time for the sands of time

16:22.960 --> 16:25.040
to eclipse the fact that it was indeed a dream.

16:25.040 --> 16:28.960
But secondly, when you have observed this happening

16:28.960 --> 16:32.640
in your mind's eye, what was the logistical reason

16:32.640 --> 16:37.040
that you could simmer up for the filmmakers filming things

16:37.040 --> 16:39.760
that they would never ever want the audience to see?

16:39.760 --> 16:41.920
Because they knew it would be in letterbox.

16:41.920 --> 16:43.840
That was my understanding is like,

16:43.840 --> 16:46.400
well, this is going to be shown in widescreen format.

16:46.400 --> 16:46.960
Exactly, yeah.

16:46.960 --> 16:48.640
No one will ever see the cables.

16:48.640 --> 16:50.400
Why even fucking worry about it?

16:50.400 --> 16:51.840
When you see Hank Azaria's dick,

16:51.840 --> 16:54.400
it's just right there at the bottom of the screen.

16:54.400 --> 16:57.760
So you go behind the letterbox,

16:57.760 --> 16:59.920
and it's just full front of Azaria.

16:59.920 --> 17:01.360
You know how in the breakup,

17:01.360 --> 17:03.120
they shot Jennifer Aniston's ass

17:03.120 --> 17:04.880
as she walked to the bathroom naked,

17:04.880 --> 17:06.320
but then they were like, no one's going to see it

17:06.320 --> 17:09.840
because it's like in the widescreen format?

17:09.840 --> 17:10.320
Yeah, no.

17:10.320 --> 17:12.320
You know, you know.

17:12.320 --> 17:12.960
That's the thing.

17:12.960 --> 17:13.600
I literally don't.

17:13.600 --> 17:14.320
This is the thing.

17:14.320 --> 17:16.080
Oh God, I hope that there are film students

17:16.080 --> 17:18.000
sitting in the front row movie theaters right now

17:18.000 --> 17:20.560
tweeting at me, you are right.

17:20.560 --> 17:21.280
Man, I got to say,

17:21.280 --> 17:21.680
people at the film school are really-

17:21.680 --> 17:23.440
I hope you guys get Probe Roots of Cairode

17:23.440 --> 17:24.320
right into that screen.

17:24.320 --> 17:25.920
I hope you get Last Action Heroed

17:25.920 --> 17:26.960
right through the celluloid.

17:26.960 --> 17:28.320
I was tweeting in the front row

17:28.320 --> 17:30.160
and Arnold Schwarzenegger turned to me and said,

17:30.160 --> 17:31.280
hey, stop it.

17:31.280 --> 17:32.880
I tried to kill Predator up here.

17:33.920 --> 17:34.800
That's not what...

17:34.800 --> 17:36.320
Do you guys want to Yahoo?

17:36.320 --> 17:36.720
Please.

17:38.560 --> 17:40.960
This Yahoo was sent in by Zoe Kinski.

17:40.960 --> 17:41.600
Climb that ladder.

17:41.600 --> 17:43.120
How long is she going to be climbing that ladder?

17:43.120 --> 17:44.000
Because I got to say-

17:44.000 --> 17:45.200
As long as it takes.

17:45.200 --> 17:46.480
She should be up there.

17:46.480 --> 17:49.280
It's by Yahoo Answers user, something has gone wrong.

17:50.160 --> 17:54.480
Let's call them Stealers Jack, okay?

17:55.280 --> 18:00.960
Asks, fair warning, a preface.

18:00.960 --> 18:05.840
This breaks our own rule for the sort of code of conduct

18:05.840 --> 18:07.520
for Yahoo's that make it on the show.

18:08.080 --> 18:10.240
But it's a fascinating question.

18:10.240 --> 18:14.960
I mass drew a biffed with my terrible towel.

18:14.960 --> 18:15.760
Super Bowl party?

18:15.760 --> 18:16.320
There's more.

18:16.320 --> 18:25.440
Can you just do your best to try...

18:25.440 --> 18:28.240
I don't want to make fun of people's writing

18:28.240 --> 18:29.280
or spelling abilities.

18:29.280 --> 18:30.800
Can you just translate for me

18:30.800 --> 18:33.680
to the best of your knowledge you're reading there?

18:33.680 --> 18:36.160
What is your brain filling in the gaps to make it say?

18:36.960 --> 18:40.000
Mass drew a biffed with my terrible towel.

18:40.000 --> 18:40.720
Mass drew a biffed?

18:41.360 --> 18:43.520
I think it means they were having a wank.

18:43.520 --> 18:44.640
Having a wank.

18:44.640 --> 18:48.160
I did a proper wank.

18:48.160 --> 18:50.160
Reciting in gentlemanly fashion.

18:50.720 --> 18:53.200
Should I bring my terrible towel

18:53.200 --> 18:54.800
to the Super Bowl party tonight?

18:54.800 --> 18:57.760
It's the same one that I used to masturbate with.

18:57.760 --> 19:00.640
And I just noticed there are stains on it.

19:00.640 --> 19:01.600
If I do bring it...

19:01.600 --> 19:03.520
I tried to fucking ramp over that, guys.

19:03.520 --> 19:04.400
I'm sorry.

19:04.400 --> 19:06.800
If I do bring it, my friends will know

19:06.800 --> 19:08.400
I've been masturbating.

19:08.400 --> 19:10.000
If I don't bring it,

19:10.000 --> 19:12.160
they will question my loyalty to the Steelers

19:12.160 --> 19:13.840
and I'll be the only one without a towel.

19:13.840 --> 19:15.520
The game kicks off in an hour.

19:15.520 --> 19:16.320
Help!

19:16.320 --> 19:18.800
Yo dawg, I question your loyalty to the Steelers.

19:18.800 --> 19:20.800
You're either the worst Steelers fan

19:20.800 --> 19:22.240
or the biggest.

19:22.240 --> 19:22.880
Yeah.

19:22.880 --> 19:23.840
Can I say one thing?

19:25.440 --> 19:26.320
Can I say one thing?

19:26.320 --> 19:27.520
One thing on this subject.

19:27.520 --> 19:28.560
Can I say one thing?

19:28.560 --> 19:29.920
Can I say just one thing first?

19:29.920 --> 19:31.840
Can I just say one thing before you say one thing?

19:31.840 --> 19:33.440
Let me get in my one thing real quick.

19:33.440 --> 19:34.880
Let me just slide it wide and say,

19:34.880 --> 19:36.560
it is most certainly terrible.

19:36.560 --> 19:38.400
Damn it, that was my one thing.

19:38.400 --> 19:40.000
I thought that'd be both of your things.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.360
It's an exceptionally terrible towel.

19:41.360 --> 19:43.120
It's a very terrible towel.

19:43.120 --> 19:44.720
I think they would get it and be like,

19:44.720 --> 19:47.040
is this cum everywhere on this?

19:47.040 --> 19:48.080
Why did you do this?

19:48.080 --> 19:49.200
And then they would get it like,

19:49.200 --> 19:50.400
oh, wait a minute.

19:50.400 --> 19:51.760
That's a terrible towel.

19:51.760 --> 19:53.760
This has been promoted to Alexander's

19:53.760 --> 19:55.680
no good, very bad, horrible towel.

19:57.200 --> 19:58.800
Nobody liked this towel.

19:58.800 --> 20:01.280
It's not getting invited back to the towel gathering.

20:01.280 --> 20:02.640
Everybody's screaming at him like,

20:02.640 --> 20:03.440
fuck you, Jerry.

20:03.440 --> 20:04.880
And then Steve stands up and he's like,

20:04.880 --> 20:08.080
no, he has the worst towel.

20:08.080 --> 20:09.040
And everyone agrees

20:09.040 --> 20:10.720
that they carry a model on their shoulders

20:10.720 --> 20:12.160
and then they throw them in a dumpster.

20:14.080 --> 20:15.520
Oh, God bless.

20:15.520 --> 20:16.720
Maybe it catches on though.

20:16.720 --> 20:18.720
And worst sporting trend of the year

20:18.720 --> 20:22.000
goes to this guy for coming in towels.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.720
Just, he's beaten out Vuvuzelas.

20:24.720 --> 20:25.840
Congratulations.

20:28.400 --> 20:29.920
Throwing batteries at people.

20:29.920 --> 20:32.720
Those three trends, this is the worst one.

20:32.720 --> 20:36.960
Oh, can you imagine not bringing your terrible,

20:36.960 --> 20:39.600
terrible towel and your friends being like,

20:40.400 --> 20:44.480
hey, do you not even care about the Steelers?

20:44.480 --> 20:49.040
And you're like, no, I can't even begin to tell you

20:49.040 --> 20:51.520
how much I care about the Steelers.

20:52.320 --> 20:54.880
It's just my terrible towel.

20:55.520 --> 20:57.040
You know how you're supposed to hold it in your hand

20:57.040 --> 20:57.920
and spin it around.

20:57.920 --> 21:00.880
Mine isn't, I don't want to be crass,

21:00.880 --> 21:03.840
but it doesn't spin anymore.

21:03.840 --> 21:07.920
How do you not have a towel, like two towels,

21:08.640 --> 21:12.080
one for everyday use and one for special occasions?

21:12.080 --> 21:13.440
Oh, okay, forget it.

21:13.440 --> 21:17.040
No, what you said at the beginning is legit.

21:17.040 --> 21:18.720
This is intentional.

21:18.720 --> 21:20.800
You didn't just grab the one towel

21:20.800 --> 21:24.000
that you fling around in circles in front of people

21:24.000 --> 21:26.400
and not have that sort of like foresight.

21:26.400 --> 21:29.600
Like, well, I mean, yeah, no, no,

21:29.600 --> 21:30.960
that's not what happened.

21:30.960 --> 21:36.960
Listen, this fucking, we can't un-jizz this towel.

21:36.960 --> 21:37.680
It happened.

21:37.680 --> 21:38.480
What happened happened.

21:38.480 --> 21:39.280
You can't go back and be like,

21:39.280 --> 21:41.360
why didn't you jizz into literally any other object

21:41.360 --> 21:44.560
other than your sports activity?

21:44.560 --> 21:46.720
Griffin, when was this question asked?

21:46.720 --> 21:48.640
Do you have access to that information?

21:48.640 --> 21:49.840
Let me dig in.

21:49.840 --> 21:52.640
Let me crack into the CSS.

21:54.880 --> 21:57.040
No, no, I don't.

21:57.040 --> 21:58.880
Well, yes, seven years ago.

21:58.880 --> 21:59.680
Oh, okay.

21:59.680 --> 22:01.360
Do you think this person's a father by now?

22:02.160 --> 22:03.840
They're a towel dad, that's for certain.

22:06.000 --> 22:10.000
AJ responded and said, you have time to wash and dry it.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.360
That's an excellent point, AJ.

22:11.360 --> 22:13.280
That's a fucking great point, AJ.

22:14.400 --> 22:16.240
Especially if you say that on a solo mission,

22:16.240 --> 22:18.400
you could be done 30 minutes.

22:18.400 --> 22:21.600
To be fair though, Steelers Jack did use the word stain.

22:22.160 --> 22:23.440
Sorry, what was his name?

22:23.440 --> 22:24.240
Steelers Jack.

22:25.840 --> 22:27.040
Yeah, I didn't think about that one.

22:27.040 --> 22:30.800
Listen, get a fucking Tide pen, Steelers Jack.

22:30.800 --> 22:31.680
This is easy.

22:31.680 --> 22:32.880
There's a million solutions.

22:32.880 --> 22:34.800
What if you accidentally bleach your terrible towel

22:34.800 --> 22:37.360
and it comes out white and now it's a holy towel?

22:37.360 --> 22:39.440
You're gonna need more of like a Tide paintbrush.

22:39.440 --> 22:40.880
You're gonna need a Tide roller.

22:40.880 --> 22:42.640
You're gonna need a Tide garbage can.

22:42.640 --> 22:45.040
You're gonna need a Tide gun from Splatoon.

22:45.040 --> 22:46.880
Oh no, wait, I've got it.

22:46.880 --> 22:48.000
I've got it, Steelers Jack.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.280
You gotta go the other way.

22:49.280 --> 22:51.840
You're gonna have to stain it worse with other stuff.

22:52.800 --> 22:53.920
Oh my God.

22:53.920 --> 22:55.440
Some spaghetti sauce, right?

22:55.440 --> 22:57.120
And then you show up and your friend's like, what?

22:57.120 --> 22:58.720
And you're like, it never leaves my side.

23:00.560 --> 23:03.760
It is my spaghetti and also wankin' buddy.

23:03.760 --> 23:05.680
I'm like, Arthur Dent over here.

23:05.680 --> 23:07.040
That makes me happy, Travis.

23:07.040 --> 23:08.080
I was worried you were gonna say

23:08.080 --> 23:09.680
jerk off everybody else's towel.

23:12.480 --> 23:15.440
That would take planning far outstripping the hour you've got.

23:15.440 --> 23:17.520
That's a lot of Ocean's Eleven, you know,

23:17.520 --> 23:20.640
getting past the censors to get to your friend's house.

23:20.640 --> 23:23.360
Maybe if I had a Holocaust cloak, possibly,

23:23.360 --> 23:25.440
with a month to plan, maybe.

23:25.440 --> 23:28.000
We're talking about jerking off onto football towels

23:28.000 --> 23:30.080
and you just dropped both Hitchhikers

23:30.080 --> 23:34.080
and Princess Ride references and I'm super proud of you.

23:34.080 --> 23:34.560
Thank you.

23:34.560 --> 23:35.520
I do what I can.

23:35.520 --> 23:36.400
Here's another question.

23:36.960 --> 23:39.120
I work in a job that doesn't have set hours.

23:39.120 --> 23:41.520
Most people come in around nine, leave around five.

23:41.520 --> 23:43.840
I come in early around seven, I leave around three.

23:44.560 --> 23:45.760
Give me a chart.

23:45.760 --> 23:47.760
For some reason, a few of my coworkers

23:47.760 --> 23:50.640
always feel the need to comment on the time I'm leaving work.

23:50.640 --> 23:52.000
Oh, going home already?

23:52.000 --> 23:54.640
How do I politely tell my coworkers to shut up

23:54.640 --> 23:56.240
about the work hours I keep?

23:56.240 --> 23:58.400
If it helps, I'm one of the most productive people

23:58.400 --> 23:59.360
in the office.

23:59.360 --> 24:01.760
Staying at work later doesn't make you better than me

24:01.760 --> 24:02.800
in Salt Lake City.

24:02.800 --> 24:04.080
Oh, that was their name, okay.

24:04.080 --> 24:06.400
Staying later, you get the idea.

24:08.160 --> 24:10.560
I think the easy answer is whenever they come in,

24:10.560 --> 24:12.560
be like, oh, you're coming in now, huh?

24:13.520 --> 24:16.800
Like give them the same treatment but on the AM side.

24:16.800 --> 24:18.400
Oh yeah, to everybody.

24:18.400 --> 24:19.440
To every fucking person.

24:19.440 --> 24:21.360
Your boss, mm, nine o'clock, huh?

24:21.360 --> 24:22.960
That's weird.

24:22.960 --> 24:25.200
Oh, well, two hours of traffic?

24:25.200 --> 24:26.000
We've all been there.

24:26.640 --> 24:28.720
That's why I left at five AM.

24:28.720 --> 24:30.000
You're gonna stay late, right?

24:30.800 --> 24:32.880
You're gonna stay late because of how late

24:32.880 --> 24:33.520
you're coming in, right?

24:33.520 --> 24:35.040
Just a second.

24:35.040 --> 24:38.320
I'm not the boss of you, but I am the most productive person

24:38.320 --> 24:39.440
in the office, so.

24:39.440 --> 24:43.120
Yeah, and that's how he got the name Franklin,

24:43.120 --> 24:47.200
the total ding-dong that everybody hates.

24:47.200 --> 24:48.800
This is rough though, because I get it,

24:48.800 --> 24:50.800
because if you're the first person there at seven

24:50.800 --> 24:52.560
and no one else shows up at nine,

24:54.720 --> 24:57.200
those two hours don't exist to anyone else.

24:57.200 --> 24:57.440
Yeah.

24:57.440 --> 24:58.240
You know what I mean?

24:58.240 --> 24:59.920
They don't show up at nine and think,

24:59.920 --> 25:01.840
I bet he's been here since seven.

25:04.080 --> 25:07.040
You need to send out some Snapchats or something.

25:07.040 --> 25:07.280
Yeah.

25:08.080 --> 25:10.080
Something that's like, just got to work,

25:10.080 --> 25:11.520
to everybody you work with.

25:11.520 --> 25:15.040
Or set enough traps that there's no way

25:15.040 --> 25:18.000
you could have done it without a couple hours of planning.

25:18.000 --> 25:19.760
What are you, what?

25:19.760 --> 25:22.240
Like, you know how, like, okay,

25:22.240 --> 25:24.080
when the Wet Bandits showed up at Kevin's house-

25:24.080 --> 25:24.560
Fuck me.

25:24.560 --> 25:26.480
Can we go a single episode?

25:26.480 --> 25:27.680
They did not think, oh man,

25:27.680 --> 25:29.360
I bet he just got here five minutes ago.

25:29.360 --> 25:31.200
That is my favorite part of Home Alone,

25:31.200 --> 25:32.800
when the Wet Bandits take a step back

25:32.800 --> 25:34.480
and they're like, listen, I hate this kid.

25:34.480 --> 25:34.960
Fuck him.

25:34.960 --> 25:35.440
Am I right?

25:35.440 --> 25:35.840
Am I right?

25:35.840 --> 25:36.400
Okay.

25:36.400 --> 25:37.920
But wow, Ryan.

25:37.920 --> 25:38.320
Wow.

25:38.320 --> 25:39.360
Good traps.

25:39.360 --> 25:39.920
Good traps.

25:39.920 --> 25:40.880
He is doing great.

25:40.880 --> 25:41.600
Hey, Kev.

25:41.600 --> 25:43.440
Kevin, great traps.

25:43.440 --> 25:44.720
It's me, Joe Pesci.

25:45.920 --> 25:47.680
I'm a big fan of your traps.

25:47.680 --> 25:49.840
The problem with most traps,

25:49.840 --> 25:52.240
like, I'm saying if you set enough office traps,

25:52.240 --> 25:53.200
they show up, they think,

25:53.200 --> 25:54.960
God, he's been here for a couple hours, huh?

25:55.680 --> 25:56.960
Definitely, like, he got here early.

25:56.960 --> 25:58.880
That's one way, it's a way to prove

25:59.600 --> 26:01.520
that you've been there for a while,

26:01.520 --> 26:03.120
is to set up plenty of office traps.

26:03.120 --> 26:04.560
The problem with office traps,

26:04.560 --> 26:07.680
as I have, like, the ones that I know about,

26:08.320 --> 26:10.560
there's very few that are guaranteed

26:10.560 --> 26:11.920
to end the way you want them to.

26:11.920 --> 26:14.880
Like, the thing about the bucket and the doorframe,

26:14.880 --> 26:18.560
like, that probably ends with the bottom of a bucket

26:18.560 --> 26:19.920
falling on somebody and killing them.

26:19.920 --> 26:22.080
Like, definitely, that's how it ends

26:22.080 --> 26:23.600
80% of the time, I would think.

26:25.680 --> 26:28.320
The whoopee cushion, that has never worked.

26:28.320 --> 26:30.000
Did you know whoopee cushion has never worked?

26:31.520 --> 26:32.480
Yeah, because you sit on it

26:32.480 --> 26:34.080
and your butt closes the lip part

26:34.080 --> 26:35.120
and it's just like,

26:35.120 --> 26:36.640
you're sitting on a weird balloon for a second.

26:36.640 --> 26:37.920
And it just explodes.

26:37.920 --> 26:39.440
You're sitting on a hemorrhoid donut.

26:39.440 --> 26:40.400
It's miserable.

26:40.400 --> 26:41.120
It doesn't work.

26:41.760 --> 26:42.880
What about, like, a tiger pit?

26:42.880 --> 26:46.320
Depends on where you work, I guess.

26:46.320 --> 26:46.800
Yeah, that's a good point.

26:46.800 --> 26:48.960
See, I think I would make such a good pit

26:48.960 --> 26:51.600
in trying to cover it up with leaves and branches

26:51.600 --> 26:53.280
that it would be like, fine.

26:53.280 --> 26:53.920
Oh, that?

26:53.920 --> 26:56.080
That patch of the break room

26:56.080 --> 26:57.840
that's covered with leaves and branches?

26:57.840 --> 26:59.840
That's been there for, I don't know, months.

26:59.840 --> 27:00.960
But it could backfire,

27:00.960 --> 27:03.040
because if you started and didn't finish

27:03.040 --> 27:05.360
in the two hours before everyone else showed up

27:05.360 --> 27:06.000
and they were like,

27:06.000 --> 27:09.040
oh, couldn't get that tiger pit done, huh?

27:09.040 --> 27:11.040
And then you just look like a real asshole.

27:11.040 --> 27:12.560
Yeah, and if you leave at three that day,

27:12.560 --> 27:12.960
they're like,

27:12.960 --> 27:14.480
don't you want to finish your tiger pit first?

27:14.480 --> 27:16.240
Aren't you going to finish the tiger pit, Dave?

27:17.920 --> 27:18.640
Damn, Dave.

27:18.640 --> 27:21.920
You didn't know you were a real half-asser, Dave.

27:22.640 --> 27:24.240
A tiger's going to go hungry, Dave.

27:24.240 --> 27:24.800
That's on you.

27:24.800 --> 27:25.440
You're in danger.

27:25.440 --> 27:27.920
Guess you're going to finish that one tomorrow, huh, Dave?

27:27.920 --> 27:29.280
All right, see you at nine.

27:29.840 --> 27:32.000
I love that Justin apparently thinks

27:32.000 --> 27:34.160
that a tiger pit is a cool place

27:34.160 --> 27:36.880
for tigers to eat and hang out and do whatever.

27:37.840 --> 27:40.000
That's my favorite bar, the tiger pit.

27:40.000 --> 27:41.120
I have to assume that,

27:41.120 --> 27:43.440
because what kind of dumb, dumb shit are you suggesting

27:43.440 --> 27:46.160
that he has tigers in his office that he's trying to capture?

27:46.160 --> 27:46.560
Why would that be the case?

27:46.560 --> 27:48.560
That's why he's got to leave early, before dinner.

27:49.600 --> 27:50.480
Tiger dinner.

27:51.440 --> 27:52.240
I would go to the zoo.

27:53.120 --> 27:54.800
I don't want to be in there after three, man.

27:56.160 --> 27:57.520
No, that's when the tigers come to life

27:57.520 --> 27:59.280
and start talking to Kevin James.

28:01.760 --> 28:03.360
That's why no one pulls graveyard shifts

28:03.360 --> 28:04.560
at the Gremlin factory.

28:04.560 --> 28:05.760
No one wants that gig.

28:05.760 --> 28:06.880
Ugh, gross.

28:06.880 --> 28:07.360
No way.

28:07.360 --> 28:08.160
I don't want to be there.

28:08.160 --> 28:10.560
Gremlin is a terrible slang term for Mogwai.

28:11.600 --> 28:12.080
What?

28:12.080 --> 28:12.880
Sorry?

28:12.880 --> 28:13.360
What?

28:14.320 --> 28:15.360
No, sorry, what?

28:16.240 --> 28:17.760
I mean, they're called Mogwai.

28:18.240 --> 28:20.640
Gremlin is the bad thing that they become.

28:21.520 --> 28:22.480
It's offensive.

28:22.480 --> 28:23.760
Okay, so here, okay, wait a minute.

28:23.760 --> 28:24.560
Okay, so-

28:24.560 --> 28:24.880
Wait a minute.

28:24.880 --> 28:30.240
Okay, though, Travis, I think Travis has a point.

28:31.040 --> 28:31.520
Thank you.

28:31.520 --> 28:34.400
Their species remains constant.

28:34.880 --> 28:36.480
They are still Mogwai.

28:36.480 --> 28:39.440
Mogwai, they have a side of them

28:39.440 --> 28:41.840
that we don't particularly care for.

28:41.840 --> 28:42.400
Okay, okay.

28:42.400 --> 28:44.000
And we just start using,

28:44.000 --> 28:48.080
I mean, let's call it what it is, a slur against Mogwai.

28:48.080 --> 28:52.320
So was this cryptozoological civics lesson delivered

28:52.320 --> 28:55.120
in the special mushrooms cut of gremlins

28:55.120 --> 28:56.800
that the two of you apparently watched together?

28:58.160 --> 29:01.040
The bottom, if you could remove the letter box

29:01.040 --> 29:04.080
from Night Around the Museum

29:04.080 --> 29:05.120
or whatever preposition-

29:05.120 --> 29:09.600
Night Within the Museum.

29:09.600 --> 29:10.800
If you remove the letter box,

29:10.800 --> 29:14.000
you would just see a Mogwai down there at the bottom

29:14.000 --> 29:17.920
giving you a very thorough lecture about nomenclature

29:17.920 --> 29:18.880
and the power of words to hurt you.

29:18.880 --> 29:20.560
Yeah, don't use the G word, yeah.

29:21.200 --> 29:21.440
Right.

29:22.000 --> 29:25.280
I think it was called Ben Stiller's Museum Nights.

29:28.320 --> 29:31.680
Well, I preferred the original Ben Stiller's Museum,

29:32.240 --> 29:34.400
but I thought that the sequel was much sexier.

29:34.400 --> 29:36.000
Yeah, way hotter.

29:36.560 --> 29:38.000
Should we go to the fucking Money Zone?

29:38.000 --> 29:39.280
Yeah, cool.

29:49.760 --> 29:50.880
Y'all wanna hear about Blue Apron?

29:50.880 --> 29:52.640
Y'all wanna hear me brag about the dope ass meals

29:52.640 --> 29:53.760
I've been making with Blue Apron?

29:54.880 --> 29:56.000
Did you make that steak, Sammy?

29:56.720 --> 29:59.200
Yeah, oh, you know we made that steak, Sammy.

29:59.200 --> 30:00.800
Yeah, that Sammy with a,

30:00.800 --> 30:05.920
there was like a Sammy that had like onions and mushrooms,

30:05.920 --> 30:07.040
which like, I'll tell you what,

30:07.040 --> 30:08.720
I never ate mushrooms until I got-

30:08.720 --> 30:09.280
Oh, same.

30:09.280 --> 30:11.040
Like I enjoy a mushroom at a restaurant.

30:11.040 --> 30:12.320
I never, ever cooked with them.

30:12.320 --> 30:14.160
And then it was like the featured guy

30:14.160 --> 30:16.720
in the last week of ingredients.

30:16.720 --> 30:18.160
And it was like on point.

30:18.160 --> 30:19.760
It was some good mushroom eating.

30:19.760 --> 30:20.880
For less than $10 a meal,

30:20.880 --> 30:22.560
Blue Apron delivers all the fresh ingredients

30:22.560 --> 30:24.080
you need to create home-cooked meals.

30:24.080 --> 30:26.240
You just follow the easy step-by-step instructions.

30:26.240 --> 30:28.240
Okay, there, go, yes.

30:28.240 --> 30:30.240
Yeah, it's an ingredient delivery service

30:30.240 --> 30:33.680
and they have recipes and you get amazing,

30:33.680 --> 30:35.280
really, really, really tasty meals.

30:36.480 --> 30:42.400
I have a beef taco with mole that is still waiting for me.

30:42.400 --> 30:43.440
I'm really, really excited.

30:43.440 --> 30:45.040
Maybe I should bring that to the Super Bowl party

30:45.040 --> 30:46.000
I'm going to today.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.800
Just two tacos with mole and steak.

30:48.800 --> 30:50.080
This is for me, thank you.

30:50.080 --> 30:51.440
This is for me, please don't watch me eat this.

30:51.440 --> 30:52.880
Please don't watch me eat this.

30:52.880 --> 30:54.080
Coming up this week,

30:54.080 --> 30:57.840
the meals this week are roast chicken supreme

30:57.840 --> 31:00.640
with mashed potatoes, gravy, and maple-glazed carrots.

31:00.640 --> 31:02.880
Spiced salmon with black rice, avocado,

31:02.880 --> 31:04.000
and blood orange salad.

31:04.000 --> 31:04.800
Fuck.

31:04.800 --> 31:05.600
My goodness.

31:05.600 --> 31:07.760
Steak sandwich with caramelized onions,

31:07.760 --> 31:10.080
garlic aioli, and honey roasted parsnip fries.

31:10.720 --> 31:11.040
Oh my God.

31:11.040 --> 31:13.600
Miso honey roasted chicken and baby sweet potatoes

31:13.600 --> 31:15.280
with stir fried sesame bok choy.

31:15.280 --> 31:16.320
Jesus Christ.

31:16.320 --> 31:18.960
And they've got vegetarian options as well.

31:18.960 --> 31:21.200
Yeah, so no matter what your dietary preferences,

31:21.200 --> 31:24.000
Blue Apron makes it a breeze to discover and prepare dishes

31:24.000 --> 31:25.760
like the ones that we've been talking about.

31:26.800 --> 31:27.680
Right in your own kitchen.

31:27.680 --> 31:29.440
You don't have to go to somebody else's kitchen.

31:29.440 --> 31:31.840
Here's a pro tip secret from Travis McElroy.

31:32.720 --> 31:35.040
We get the ones that are like for two people,

31:35.040 --> 31:36.080
for me and Teresa,

31:36.080 --> 31:38.080
and there's always tons of leftovers.

31:38.080 --> 31:40.080
This will be like your lunch the next day.

31:40.640 --> 31:41.760
It's such a good deal.

31:41.760 --> 31:43.360
Here's a pro tip for me.

31:43.360 --> 31:44.400
Here's a pro tip for me.

31:44.400 --> 31:45.040
No, there's not.

31:45.760 --> 31:46.240
Oh, well.

31:47.040 --> 31:47.360
Okay.

31:49.360 --> 31:51.120
You can get your first two meals for free

31:51.120 --> 31:52.880
at blueapron.com slash my brother.

31:52.880 --> 31:54.720
That's blueapron.com slash my brother.

31:54.720 --> 31:55.680
I know we like,

31:55.680 --> 31:57.680
we're always very effusive about the products

31:57.680 --> 31:59.360
we advertise on this show

31:59.360 --> 32:01.280
because frankly they're all baller

32:01.280 --> 32:02.640
and if they weren't, we wouldn't do it.

32:03.760 --> 32:06.240
But Blue Apron has changed my life

32:06.240 --> 32:08.720
because I am cooking constantly now

32:08.720 --> 32:11.040
and I love to cook, but I hate shopping for shit.

32:11.040 --> 32:15.840
And this is the ideal way to cook meals, Blue Apron.

32:15.840 --> 32:16.800
Check it out.

32:16.800 --> 32:18.480
I also want to tell you about Squarespace.

32:19.440 --> 32:20.640
We've been talking about Squarespace.

32:20.640 --> 32:22.800
Squarespace has been a sponsor of us for a long time.

32:22.800 --> 32:26.640
But I could say that we built the macroshows.com website

32:26.640 --> 32:27.600
on Squarespace.

32:27.600 --> 32:30.080
It's got links to like all of our projects and stuff.

32:30.080 --> 32:32.800
But the important part is everybody who looks at it,

32:32.800 --> 32:36.080
no joke, has said, wow, what a professional website.

32:36.080 --> 32:37.360
Like it looks so good.

32:37.360 --> 32:40.960
Yeah, it's like a weird involuntary hive mind response.

32:40.960 --> 32:43.520
Yeah, and I did it in about 45 minutes.

32:44.160 --> 32:48.880
Like it was the most straightforward just structure.

32:48.880 --> 32:53.040
It was so simple and so user-friendly.

32:54.080 --> 32:54.880
I recommend it.

32:54.880 --> 32:57.040
If you're looking to build a professional looking website,

32:57.040 --> 32:58.720
but you have no idea what you're doing,

32:59.280 --> 33:00.720
Squarespace is the way to go.

33:00.720 --> 33:02.400
And if you are looking to start a project,

33:02.400 --> 33:04.800
here's the good news, you can start your free trial today.

33:05.360 --> 33:08.720
Try it for free and you don't have to pay anything to start.

33:08.720 --> 33:10.080
And then if you like what you're doing,

33:10.800 --> 33:13.120
trust me, you will, then you can worry about that.

33:13.120 --> 33:14.800
But right now it's free.

33:14.800 --> 33:17.200
Go to squarespace.com slash my brother.

33:17.200 --> 33:18.080
My brother.

33:18.080 --> 33:18.640
You should.

33:19.760 --> 33:20.560
Squarespace.

33:20.560 --> 33:20.960
I am.

33:21.760 --> 33:22.800
You should.

33:22.800 --> 33:24.640
Justin, can I tell you something?

33:24.640 --> 33:25.040
Do it.

33:25.040 --> 33:25.600
You should.

33:26.320 --> 33:26.560
I...

33:27.920 --> 33:30.400
You should Squarespace.

33:30.400 --> 33:30.800
All right.

33:31.840 --> 33:33.360
I'm just trying a couple of different reads

33:33.360 --> 33:34.240
and we can just pick the best one.

33:34.240 --> 33:34.720
I like it.

33:35.280 --> 33:37.680
I have a message for Spud and it's from...

33:38.640 --> 33:39.520
Don't laugh at that.

33:41.360 --> 33:41.680
Okay.

33:42.320 --> 33:43.600
It's from McBabby.

33:43.600 --> 33:44.880
If you want to get a message on the show,

33:44.880 --> 33:46.960
personal message or a message for your small business,

33:46.960 --> 33:48.880
go to maximumfun.org slash Jumbotron.

33:48.880 --> 33:49.600
It's real easy.

33:49.600 --> 33:51.280
Stop sending weird shit.

33:51.840 --> 33:53.520
They don't have to be weird, you guys.

33:53.520 --> 33:54.560
They don't have to be weird.

33:54.560 --> 33:57.040
We literally, just like a quick disclaimer,

33:57.040 --> 34:02.400
we have turned down like two or three Jumbotron ads this week

34:02.400 --> 34:04.560
and we hate doing it because like we know it's always like

34:05.280 --> 34:07.760
in a good spirit, but just like,

34:08.400 --> 34:10.800
please, I just need to be able to understand what I'm saying.

34:11.680 --> 34:13.040
I mean, I'm less worried about that

34:13.040 --> 34:17.280
and more worried about like, don't have a say like creepy stuff too.

34:17.280 --> 34:20.560
Maybe 2015 is the year of Jumbotron sincerity.

34:21.120 --> 34:23.040
Just like keep it real.

34:23.040 --> 34:24.480
Just keep it very real.

34:24.480 --> 34:25.360
That said.

34:25.360 --> 34:27.440
Here's a message for Spud from McBabby.

34:27.440 --> 34:28.960
This is a very sincere message.

34:28.960 --> 34:31.360
Hey Spud, happy belated birthday.

34:31.360 --> 34:33.920
Thanks for being a good friend, always believing me

34:33.920 --> 34:36.000
and not murdering me when we finally met.

34:36.000 --> 34:36.960
Talk to you later.

34:36.960 --> 34:38.160
I like this a lot.

34:38.160 --> 34:39.600
I like this concept of just like,

34:39.600 --> 34:43.120
listen, we're all just a bunch of fucking primal beasts, aren't we?

34:43.120 --> 34:44.400
I love this idea of just like,

34:44.400 --> 34:47.440
hey guys, thanks for not murdering me.

34:47.440 --> 34:50.160
Well, maybe this was one of those Craigslist friendships.

34:50.160 --> 34:50.880
Sure.

34:50.880 --> 34:52.640
Yeah, friend for friend.

34:52.640 --> 34:54.480
Friend for friend, looking for friend.

34:55.200 --> 34:57.840
And then it's like, oh, I hope this person is actually my friend.

34:57.840 --> 35:03.360
Absolutely, absolutely not looking for somebody just to jerk off with.

35:03.360 --> 35:05.280
Absolutely not what this is.

35:05.280 --> 35:06.160
Don't even bring it up.

35:06.160 --> 35:08.960
Sexual friend for friend, no stabbing, please.

35:08.960 --> 35:10.000
No stabbing, no games.

35:10.000 --> 35:11.440
Stabbers need not apply.

35:15.120 --> 35:16.560
Justin, you gonna read this next one?

35:16.560 --> 35:17.600
Hell yeah.

35:17.600 --> 35:22.640
This one's going out to Amanda from, that's a fucking cool name.

35:22.640 --> 35:23.520
Yeah, for sure.

35:23.520 --> 35:25.120
I thought I was reading one name,

35:25.120 --> 35:27.040
then halfway through I thought I was reading another one.

35:27.040 --> 35:28.640
It's like, mm, daddy like.

35:29.200 --> 35:33.600
So daddy like, Amanda, this message is from Jackie.

35:34.480 --> 35:34.960
Here it is.

35:35.600 --> 35:37.440
Dear Amanda, I'm sorry for getting high

35:37.440 --> 35:39.200
and taking your shit in the monastery.

35:40.880 --> 35:45.440
Dad, I didn't know where I was and I got confused.

35:46.000 --> 35:47.280
Thank you for cleaning me up.

35:47.280 --> 35:49.760
I know I was totally wasted and I owe you one.

35:49.760 --> 35:51.760
Thanks for letting me live in your house too.

35:51.760 --> 35:53.680
No one could ever love me like you.

35:53.680 --> 35:56.000
That says, love always, Jackie.

35:57.520 --> 35:58.400
What happened?

35:58.400 --> 36:01.600
I choose to believe that this is 100% sincere.

36:02.400 --> 36:03.200
I love that.

36:03.200 --> 36:04.000
I'm into that.

36:04.000 --> 36:05.120
I believe it is sincere.

36:05.120 --> 36:09.840
Or possibly is a message that Amanda bought for herself

36:09.840 --> 36:11.360
from her dog, Jackie.

36:11.360 --> 36:13.840
That is my other possible option.

36:13.840 --> 36:16.880
You know when dogs get super high and they take shit places?

36:17.680 --> 36:19.040
Well, the second half of that happens.

36:20.000 --> 36:21.600
And I assume dogs are getting high too

36:21.600 --> 36:23.440
because like, how else are they getting through?

36:27.040 --> 36:29.040
Hello there, my name is Graham Clark.

36:29.040 --> 36:30.240
And I'm Dave Shumka.

36:30.240 --> 36:34.080
And together we host a podcast called Stop Podcasting Yourself.

36:34.080 --> 36:36.640
This is a file that you download from the internet

36:36.640 --> 36:38.480
and then you listen to it in your pod.

36:38.480 --> 36:39.920
What's that about, you ask?

36:39.920 --> 36:41.280
Well, who are you to ask?

36:41.280 --> 36:42.480
Who do you think you are?

36:42.480 --> 36:44.400
Yeah, get lost, bozo.

36:44.400 --> 36:46.560
We're a couple of stand up comedians

36:46.560 --> 36:48.880
in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

36:48.880 --> 36:51.520
And every week we bring a guest on the show.

36:51.520 --> 36:52.800
Sometimes they're Canadian.

36:52.800 --> 36:54.080
Sometimes they're not.

36:54.080 --> 36:55.440
Sometimes they're a ghost.

36:55.440 --> 36:58.720
It's like you're sitting in on a friendly afternoon chat.

36:58.720 --> 37:01.520
Plus we're Canadian, so you get a tax break.

37:01.520 --> 37:07.760
You can find us on iTunes or online at MaximumFun.org.

37:10.800 --> 37:11.600
Do you guys want a yahoo?

37:12.240 --> 37:12.720
Yes.

37:12.720 --> 37:13.440
I guess I do.

37:14.080 --> 37:17.600
I have two extremely good ones and I want to get to both of them.

37:17.600 --> 37:19.040
Can I have, do we have any like,

37:19.040 --> 37:21.680
are the rest of the email questions like totally baller

37:21.680 --> 37:23.120
or can I do two yahoo's in a row?

37:24.160 --> 37:25.600
Scraps, what do you say?

37:28.080 --> 37:30.000
They're all pretty good, but we can do yahoo's

37:30.000 --> 37:31.760
and then just save them for next week.

37:32.320 --> 37:33.920
I can also save the yahoo's for next week.

37:34.720 --> 37:35.120
This one was-

37:35.120 --> 37:36.160
Let's just see how it goes.

37:36.160 --> 37:38.080
This one was sent in by Jacob Powels.

37:38.080 --> 37:38.800
Thank you, Jacob.

37:40.800 --> 37:44.240
It is by Yahoo Answers user Vanessa who asks,

37:45.280 --> 37:48.080
three mysterious stones at my front door?

37:49.440 --> 37:52.160
Today I got home and saw that there were three stones

37:52.160 --> 37:53.440
lined up at my front door.

37:53.440 --> 37:56.160
This is the second time I've seen something like this at my door.

37:56.160 --> 37:58.880
Does anyone know what this could be or mean?

37:58.880 --> 38:02.000
I've asked my family and no one seems to know how it got there.

38:03.840 --> 38:04.640
Pirate curse?

38:05.760 --> 38:06.240
Explain.

38:06.880 --> 38:07.840
Like a black spot?

38:08.400 --> 38:10.960
Like this is, I don't think it's the same as the black spot

38:10.960 --> 38:12.400
because the black spot is like,

38:12.400 --> 38:14.480
hey, you betrayed us and now we have to kill you.

38:14.480 --> 38:15.360
Yeah, it's also a black spot.

38:15.360 --> 38:16.320
Maybe the three stones is like,

38:16.320 --> 38:18.560
you've been chosen as the new pirate.

38:18.560 --> 38:19.360
You got chose.

38:20.240 --> 38:20.960
You done been chose.

38:20.960 --> 38:23.440
Hi, I'm a pirate and you got chose.

38:23.440 --> 38:24.480
You're on my team now.

38:24.480 --> 38:26.080
Welcome to the squad, squad goals.

38:26.080 --> 38:28.400
Have you ever seen Wild and Crazy Kids?

38:29.040 --> 38:29.360
Yeah.

38:29.360 --> 38:30.400
You know how they have teams?

38:31.520 --> 38:33.600
Well, that's based on pirate teams.

38:33.600 --> 38:34.480
The old tradition.

38:35.280 --> 38:38.960
The concept of people working together?

38:39.680 --> 38:41.600
It's based on pirate teams.

38:41.600 --> 38:43.840
Pirates were the first people to be like-

38:43.840 --> 38:46.880
They used to get together and roll like a giant stone around

38:46.880 --> 38:48.640
while they were festooned with ribbons

38:49.440 --> 38:51.600
and you could only get the ribbons by killing each other.

38:51.600 --> 38:52.640
Well, they soften that a bit.

38:52.640 --> 38:55.040
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

38:55.040 --> 38:59.680
Travis, Travis, Travis, are you literally high right now?

38:59.680 --> 39:01.360
Are you literally on acid?

39:01.360 --> 39:04.240
Did you drop right before we started recording

39:04.240 --> 39:06.000
this comedy podcast together?

39:06.000 --> 39:08.960
No, not that I know of.

39:08.960 --> 39:11.600
Because you've been saying some next level shit.

39:14.880 --> 39:17.760
It's 8.55 AM, more Travis's.

39:17.760 --> 39:18.400
That's correct.

39:18.400 --> 39:20.960
I've had my morning coffee, I took the dog on a walk

39:20.960 --> 39:22.400
and I thought about pirate teams.

39:22.400 --> 39:26.480
Travis, just so I can understand what you're saying.

39:26.480 --> 39:31.520
You're saying that one day a pirate was sword fighting

39:31.520 --> 39:35.360
with a British naval officer and another pirate came up

39:36.400 --> 39:38.960
from behind and stabbed the British naval officer

39:38.960 --> 39:40.720
and he was like, how dare you?

39:42.000 --> 39:43.760
What is this witchcraft?

39:44.880 --> 39:47.120
I was fighting him, not you.

39:47.120 --> 39:50.160
And then the first pirate's like, well, I gotta go

39:50.160 --> 39:53.280
and he jumps onto his pirate ship and sails it by himself.

39:53.280 --> 39:54.960
Like fuck, this sucks.

39:54.960 --> 39:56.880
Oh my God, it's so hard.

39:56.880 --> 39:59.280
I'm jigging the mast and I have to steer

39:59.280 --> 40:02.000
and I have to look out for sharks and whales.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.320
Oh, I wish I could get some fucking help.

40:04.320 --> 40:06.160
You know the term every man for himself?

40:06.800 --> 40:07.920
Yeah, okay.

40:08.800 --> 40:10.560
That was it for a long time.

40:10.560 --> 40:11.120
That was it.

40:12.400 --> 40:14.480
The bible was very short.

40:14.480 --> 40:17.280
One day, Donnie Jeff Coats, great, great, great, great, great,

40:17.280 --> 40:19.440
great, great, great, great, great grandfather,

40:19.440 --> 40:23.760
Captain Jeff Coat said, you know what, fuck that shit.

40:25.760 --> 40:28.080
It's a coach made out of Jeffs.

40:28.080 --> 40:29.040
The Jeffs that I killed.

40:29.040 --> 40:30.720
So that they may not see me, Jeff.

40:34.160 --> 40:35.440
I don't know where to stab him.

40:35.440 --> 40:36.720
He's just, he's all Jeff.

40:38.560 --> 40:40.080
He's just Jeff from Fern to Mast.

40:40.080 --> 40:42.560
He's just fucking Jeff all over, I don't get it.

40:42.560 --> 40:45.440
From starboard to port, he's all Jeff.

40:45.440 --> 40:45.940
What?

40:46.560 --> 40:48.160
He's Jeff from tip to toe.

40:48.160 --> 40:49.520
That's crazy.

40:52.240 --> 40:56.080
Every time I think I draw a bead on a Jeff,

40:56.080 --> 40:58.000
another Jeff takes its place.

40:58.000 --> 41:00.400
I've lopped off so many Jeffs.

41:03.360 --> 41:05.200
Okay, are we gonna talk about the three stones

41:05.200 --> 41:06.880
or is this the discussion now?

41:07.520 --> 41:08.400
Captain Jeff Coat?

41:09.040 --> 41:09.540
Yeah.

41:10.880 --> 41:13.680
Probably Jeff Coats great, great grandfather.

41:13.680 --> 41:15.040
Or how many greats was it?

41:15.040 --> 41:16.800
There's a lot of greats, yeah.

41:16.800 --> 41:17.520
Too many greats.

41:17.520 --> 41:18.720
I think you put him in like the middle class.

41:18.720 --> 41:21.920
Yeah, each one lives to be 12, has a child, and dies.

41:23.520 --> 41:25.280
If you see the dread pirate robber,

41:25.280 --> 41:28.960
if you see an 11 and a half year old named Jeff

41:28.960 --> 41:32.240
looking panicked and horny, that is a Jeff Coat.

41:32.240 --> 41:33.200
No question about it.

41:33.200 --> 41:33.920
Yeah, for sure.

41:33.920 --> 41:35.600
He has got to continue the line.

41:36.640 --> 41:37.760
Like a tsetse fly.

41:38.960 --> 41:41.520
The show Wild and Crazy Kids was about Donnie Jeff Coat

41:41.520 --> 41:44.080
trying to find a successor that was savage enough

41:44.080 --> 41:44.800
and also 12 enough.

41:44.800 --> 41:47.600
The most wild and the most crazy kid.

41:52.800 --> 41:54.320
What are these three stones mean?

41:56.720 --> 41:58.800
All right, let's do this back to back Yahoo situation.

41:58.800 --> 42:00.640
This one was sent in by Brooks Oglesby.

42:00.640 --> 42:02.800
Brooks Oglesby maybe needs a name.

42:03.360 --> 42:05.280
Because this is like the third or fourth one of his

42:05.280 --> 42:05.840
that I've read.

42:07.520 --> 42:08.560
We'll think about it.

42:08.560 --> 42:09.040
Okay.

42:09.040 --> 42:10.080
We'll have it for the next time.

42:10.880 --> 42:11.360
Thank you, Brooks.

42:11.360 --> 42:15.040
It's by Yahoo Answers User Anonymous who asks,

42:16.000 --> 42:19.520
do you think we'll ever have an emo president?

42:21.840 --> 42:23.840
Imagine a president of the United States.

42:23.840 --> 42:26.800
Skinny jeans, long emo hair, all that jazz.

42:27.520 --> 42:29.920
Well, what do you think, teens?

42:34.480 --> 42:37.520
First of all, I don't think jazz is a big part of the emo scene.

42:38.720 --> 42:39.680
Oh, but if it were.

42:39.680 --> 42:41.840
Oh, but if it were.

42:41.840 --> 42:44.400
Your lips to God's ears.

42:48.560 --> 42:49.520
Dark jazz is.

42:50.480 --> 42:51.040
What's that?

42:51.600 --> 42:52.400
Dark jazz.

42:52.400 --> 42:55.200
That's what emo kids are into, dark jazz.

42:57.440 --> 42:57.680
Yeah.

42:57.680 --> 43:03.760
So it's just like, with like, you know, onyx trumpets and stuff.

43:03.760 --> 43:04.480
So hold on.

43:04.480 --> 43:04.880
No.

43:04.880 --> 43:09.280
Dark jazz is all about the zeal for life that they don't have.

43:09.280 --> 43:09.520
Yeah.

43:10.240 --> 43:14.320
It's all about the notes that you don't play because you're dead.

43:14.320 --> 43:14.640
Yeah.

43:15.600 --> 43:17.360
I liked mine better, Travis.

43:17.360 --> 43:17.520
Yeah.

43:17.520 --> 43:18.080
Let's pretend it was just-

43:18.080 --> 43:18.960
Yeah, go ahead and cut mine.

43:18.960 --> 43:20.320
Just cut Travis's.

43:20.320 --> 43:20.800
You're out.

43:22.240 --> 43:27.920
Do you think we'll ever have that emo president that our country deserves to make us all great again?

43:28.720 --> 43:29.760
Vote for me or don't.

43:29.760 --> 43:30.240
Whatever.

43:30.240 --> 43:30.640
Whatever.

43:30.640 --> 43:31.120
Shut up.

43:31.840 --> 43:36.720
At this point, at this point, I might think about it.

43:36.720 --> 43:39.200
Hey, that's very low press.

43:39.200 --> 43:40.080
I'm into it.

43:40.080 --> 43:40.720
Yeah.

43:40.720 --> 43:45.040
If someone was up on that stage, a big, beautiful, honorable, debating stage,

43:46.000 --> 43:51.920
but they had that long emo hair and the jeans would be very skinny on this person.

43:51.920 --> 43:52.640
How skinny?

43:54.240 --> 43:55.440
Talking about some nuthuggers.

43:56.000 --> 43:56.400
Okay.

43:57.120 --> 43:57.760
You asked.

43:58.480 --> 43:58.880
I know.

43:59.440 --> 44:02.640
Do you think that we would find him especially electable?

44:03.440 --> 44:06.400
I would find him delectable, but would I find him electable?

44:06.400 --> 44:08.720
Do you know what we love in this country, Griffin?

44:08.720 --> 44:09.200
Change.

44:09.200 --> 44:10.240
We love change.

44:10.240 --> 44:10.880
We embrace it.

44:10.880 --> 44:11.920
We just look for something different.

44:11.920 --> 44:22.160
I'm sick of those insider baseball politicians who they've been doing it all wrong for so long,

44:22.160 --> 44:28.880
and I'm ready for somebody who's going to get up there and tell me how it is in a depressing manner.

44:30.080 --> 44:30.880
But honest.

44:30.880 --> 44:31.360
Honest.

44:31.920 --> 44:34.320
Honest, but more depressing.

44:34.320 --> 44:35.360
Like a depressing-

44:35.360 --> 44:38.000
Can a whole emo band run for president?

44:38.000 --> 44:40.560
Like, hi, I'm President Newfound Glory.

44:41.600 --> 44:42.560
Is that a new found glory?

44:42.560 --> 44:43.600
An emo band?

44:43.600 --> 44:44.160
Yeah.

44:44.160 --> 44:46.880
Well, they were pop punk, but they had, you know, they were in the scene.

44:48.000 --> 44:50.480
But they weren't Christian pop punk?

44:51.760 --> 44:52.720
Okay, that's fine.

44:52.720 --> 44:53.920
Fall Out Boy then.

44:53.920 --> 44:54.480
Hi, I'm President-

44:54.480 --> 44:56.400
Fall Out Boy is not emo.

44:56.400 --> 44:57.840
You don't actually know an emo band scene.

44:57.840 --> 44:59.280
Dashboard Confessional?

44:59.280 --> 45:00.800
That's definitely in there.

45:00.800 --> 45:02.640
Could we elect an emu president?

45:02.640 --> 45:06.000
Hi, everybody.

45:06.000 --> 45:10.720
I'm an emu, and we all vote for him, and we're like, fucking, that's so funny and cool.

45:12.960 --> 45:15.600
He got an emo, and then the emu's like,

45:15.600 --> 45:20.800
hey, big news, I have some decidedly draconian opinions on abortion.

45:20.800 --> 45:23.920
Like, whoa, emu, oh no.

45:23.920 --> 45:27.520
We thought it was so funny and cool that we elected an emu president,

45:27.520 --> 45:30.640
but you have some decidedly draconian opinions on abortion.

45:30.640 --> 45:32.800
We did not pay any attention to his platform.

45:32.800 --> 45:33.360
We didn't think about the platform.

45:33.360 --> 45:34.960
Only his long, graceful neck.

45:34.960 --> 45:38.080
We just thought about how graceful he would look in an Oval Office.

45:38.640 --> 45:40.720
How great those future stamps would be.

45:40.720 --> 45:42.400
Just the best stamps.

45:42.400 --> 45:43.120
Wouldn't it be great?

45:43.120 --> 45:45.120
Wouldn't it be so fucking funny, though?

45:47.840 --> 45:50.800
You know that one where it's like rows of presidents,

45:50.800 --> 45:52.560
like you see like those charts, right?

45:52.560 --> 45:54.880
With like the different paintings of the presidents,

45:54.880 --> 45:57.120
and like his would just be a neck,

45:57.120 --> 46:00.400
and then just like reaching up into Lyndon Baines Johnson

46:00.400 --> 46:01.680
would be an emu head.

46:01.680 --> 46:04.080
Because he didn't fit in the frame.

46:04.080 --> 46:05.280
So fucking funny.

46:05.920 --> 46:07.840
Our first three-term president.

46:07.840 --> 46:10.480
Yeah, because you cannot get him to leave.

46:10.480 --> 46:12.800
He's incredibly fast and incredibly vicious.

46:12.800 --> 46:14.240
And he's got those kicking legs.

46:14.240 --> 46:16.640
Yeah, those kicking legs with the sharp claws.

46:16.640 --> 46:22.000
We'll have to elect President Ostrich to take him down.

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
Because that's the only thing?

46:24.640 --> 46:25.200
Yeah.

46:25.200 --> 46:26.800
I bet you let me in there with a gun.

46:28.240 --> 46:30.160
You would think, but he took all our guns away.

46:30.160 --> 46:30.640
Not mine.

46:31.600 --> 46:32.080
I hid it.

46:33.280 --> 46:34.320
Where'd you hide it, Garvin?

46:35.920 --> 46:36.800
In a box.

46:36.800 --> 46:38.080
He just like can't get in there.

46:39.200 --> 46:39.760
No thumbs.

46:39.760 --> 46:40.720
No thumbs.

46:40.720 --> 46:41.440
Sharp claws.

46:43.440 --> 46:47.280
So I was saying like-

46:47.280 --> 46:48.240
You're talking about emus?

46:48.880 --> 46:49.920
I was talking about emos.

46:50.480 --> 46:52.400
But then you realize we knew less about emo

46:52.400 --> 46:54.640
than we do about emus, improbably?

46:55.760 --> 46:56.480
That's true.

46:57.120 --> 46:58.000
Against all odds.

46:58.000 --> 46:59.360
That's-

46:59.360 --> 47:00.400
This question stinks.

47:01.200 --> 47:01.760
You stink.

47:02.800 --> 47:04.640
Read a normal one from a normal human.

47:04.640 --> 47:10.960
Wikipedia says that emus, in addition to their diet of insects,

47:11.600 --> 47:13.680
emus drink infrequently.

47:14.240 --> 47:18.640
And I kind of feel like that maybe isn't necessarily a good thing.

47:19.200 --> 47:20.400
Maybe they should like,

47:20.400 --> 47:23.120
if they had magazines to tell them to drink more,

47:23.120 --> 47:25.200
maybe they'd be getting ahead in the world, you know?

47:26.480 --> 47:27.440
You're saying they're just not-

47:27.440 --> 47:28.240
That's really good, Justin.

47:28.240 --> 47:32.080
Yeah, they're not hydrated enough to really be president?

47:32.080 --> 47:33.680
Are you guys thirsty?

47:33.680 --> 47:33.920
Yeah.

47:33.920 --> 47:35.280
Well, whatever.

47:35.280 --> 47:37.200
That's what I'm saying is like emus should be drink-

47:37.200 --> 47:39.920
Maybe if emus were drinking more, they'd be doing a bit better.

47:39.920 --> 47:40.320
All right.

47:40.320 --> 47:41.040
Can we-

47:41.040 --> 47:41.440
Okay.

47:41.440 --> 47:43.680
And have more energy in their day-to-day lives.

47:44.880 --> 47:47.920
But you know how no emu has ever accomplished anything ever?

47:47.920 --> 47:48.480
Yeah, right?

47:48.480 --> 47:49.680
Like maybe they would be president

47:49.680 --> 47:52.240
if they would just fucking just keep a brita with them.

47:52.240 --> 47:52.560
Just like-

47:52.560 --> 47:54.080
Or get some electrolytes or something.

47:54.080 --> 47:55.120
Found it, you know?

47:55.120 --> 47:56.640
You could drink green tea.

47:56.640 --> 47:58.000
That's hydrating as well.

47:58.640 --> 48:01.280
Yeah, and like it's not as caffeinated as black tea,

48:01.280 --> 48:03.040
so like you can still go to bed on time.

48:03.040 --> 48:05.120
This is episode 289.

48:05.120 --> 48:10.880
We've done this 288 and almost one extra on top of that times now.

48:10.880 --> 48:11.040
Yeah.

48:11.600 --> 48:13.680
Is this our most fanciful episode?

48:14.720 --> 48:17.920
I feel like we've gone on some fancy flights on this one.

48:17.920 --> 48:19.040
Some flights of fancy,

48:19.040 --> 48:24.080
just some fucking absurdist like mind voyages together.

48:24.080 --> 48:24.320
Yeah.

48:24.320 --> 48:28.560
Yeah, and mentioning that during the podcast

48:28.560 --> 48:31.360
is one way to really submit your comedic legacy.

48:31.360 --> 48:34.800
You know, I love my favorite episodes of MST3K

48:35.440 --> 48:37.600
are the ones where in the last 15 minutes or so

48:38.960 --> 48:42.640
they take the puppets off and they just talk to each other about like,

48:42.640 --> 48:45.120
how did you guys think the jokes went today on this one?

48:45.760 --> 48:48.000
And they sometimes they still use their hands

48:48.000 --> 48:49.280
to talk with the puppet voices,

48:49.280 --> 48:51.200
but like the puppets, they're not wearing them anymore.

48:51.200 --> 48:53.200
They're just like, they just talk about how the show went.

48:53.200 --> 48:56.560
Okay, but Justin, even that is a pretty fanciful thought.

48:57.360 --> 48:58.880
I mean, the one I just said?

48:58.880 --> 48:59.120
Yeah.

48:59.120 --> 49:00.640
Yeah, it's kind of whimsical.

49:00.640 --> 49:03.040
Are we trapped in like a fanciful spiral?

49:03.040 --> 49:04.160
Say something, Griffin.

49:04.160 --> 49:05.440
Say something logical, Griffin.

49:06.080 --> 49:10.320
Okay, I can't.

49:10.320 --> 49:11.600
I'm incapable of it.

49:13.360 --> 49:15.360
I like in the Monty Python

49:15.360 --> 49:17.280
when they switch from the dead parrot skit

49:17.280 --> 49:18.800
they have one of their famous transitions

49:18.800 --> 49:21.920
to like one of those cartoons and it's just God's face.

49:21.920 --> 49:23.520
Like, hey listen guys,

49:24.160 --> 49:27.760
I think this one might be got a little bit much.

49:27.760 --> 49:30.800
Oh my God, they do say the bits are gotten too silly.

49:31.360 --> 49:34.240
Monty Python does comment on how their shit is going.

49:34.240 --> 49:35.840
Is that what we need to aspire to?

49:36.400 --> 49:38.240
Yeah, no, yeah.

49:38.240 --> 49:39.520
I don't want, yeah.

49:39.520 --> 49:42.320
I don't want like a bunch of people quoting Monty Python jokes

49:42.320 --> 49:45.520
that is supposed to be out in a major way.

49:45.520 --> 49:47.200
Oh man, RIP Twitter indeed.

49:47.200 --> 49:50.720
I know, I definitely can't go on there.

49:52.080 --> 49:53.200
No, no, no.

49:53.200 --> 49:54.320
It's just a landmine.

49:54.320 --> 49:55.440
Pull the cord, get out.

49:55.440 --> 49:55.920
Get out.

49:55.920 --> 49:59.760
How many birds can carry a pilot?

49:59.760 --> 50:01.040
Get me out of here.

50:01.040 --> 50:02.000
I'll see you guys at Peach.

50:02.720 --> 50:04.880
Look at my silly walking.

50:04.880 --> 50:06.000
Yeah, I'm headed to Peach.

50:06.000 --> 50:06.960
No, no, no.

50:06.960 --> 50:07.680
Blast off.

50:08.560 --> 50:09.680
Get me out of here, JGL.

50:09.680 --> 50:11.760
We have a nice to say night.

50:11.760 --> 50:13.040
No, I'm an L-O.

50:13.040 --> 50:15.200
I can't hear anywhere but we heard L-O.

50:15.200 --> 50:19.040
I'm done.

50:19.040 --> 50:22.480
This has been our comedy podcast,

50:22.480 --> 50:23.920
My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

50:24.640 --> 50:26.800
It's an advice show for the modern era.

50:28.560 --> 50:30.240
Want to say a big thank you to Blue Apron

50:30.240 --> 50:31.360
who makes cooking at home easy

50:31.360 --> 50:33.440
and get your first two meals for free

50:33.440 --> 50:36.240
by going to blueapron.com slash my brother.

50:38.080 --> 50:41.040
I would like, I have an impassioned plea.

50:41.040 --> 50:42.320
It occurred to me this morning.

50:42.320 --> 50:43.120
I was on Twitter.

50:43.120 --> 50:47.920
If you wield any power on Twitter at all,

50:47.920 --> 50:51.440
even base level, at Twitter Incorporated,

50:51.440 --> 50:53.680
I would really like to be verified.

50:53.680 --> 50:54.720
I don't know what that takes,

50:55.920 --> 50:57.360
but this has gone on for too long.

50:57.360 --> 50:59.440
Yeah, Justin and I have been in the verified club for a while.

50:59.440 --> 51:02.960
And let me tell you, the golden trophies

51:02.960 --> 51:05.120
we just get in the mail for no reason

51:05.120 --> 51:06.560
if Twitter likes our shit,

51:07.360 --> 51:08.640
it's actually getting ridiculous.

51:08.640 --> 51:09.760
I just started throwing them away

51:09.760 --> 51:10.960
because there's only so much shelf space in the house.

51:10.960 --> 51:11.760
I want that.

51:11.760 --> 51:12.560
I want that.

51:12.560 --> 51:13.440
I want that.

51:13.440 --> 51:15.200
I have a whole shelf for it, please.

51:15.200 --> 51:16.240
I could send you some online.

51:16.240 --> 51:17.920
Please let me be verified, please.

51:19.280 --> 51:20.320
I want it so bad.

51:20.880 --> 51:22.240
It means literally nothing

51:22.240 --> 51:25.360
and it gets you nothing on a platform that is now dead

51:25.360 --> 51:28.000
because 100% of our interactions are gonna be,

51:29.520 --> 51:31.200
it's a man-eating rabbit, snee.

51:32.800 --> 51:35.360
Snee, it's me, Monty.

51:35.360 --> 51:37.920
I still want it, still want it.

51:37.920 --> 51:38.420
Cool.

51:40.080 --> 51:42.080
Go listen to all the other Maximum Fun shows.

51:42.080 --> 51:43.840
There's a ton of really, really great shows

51:43.840 --> 51:45.360
on the Maximum Fun network.

51:45.360 --> 51:46.880
I'm talking about shows like Throwing Shade.

51:46.880 --> 51:50.480
I'm talking about shows like Oh No, Ross and Carrie.

51:50.480 --> 51:52.240
I'm talking about shows like Can I Pet Your Tongue?

51:52.240 --> 51:56.000
Oh No, Ross and Carrie, by the way, just did Scientology.

51:56.000 --> 51:57.280
Yeah, which they've been working on forever.

51:57.280 --> 51:58.800
I cannot wait.

51:58.800 --> 52:00.880
Yeah, so yeah, there's that.

52:00.880 --> 52:02.240
We have a bunch of our other stuff.

52:02.240 --> 52:04.080
You can find it all at McElroy Shows.

52:04.080 --> 52:07.200
I do a Bachelor podcast with my wife called Rose Buddies.

52:07.200 --> 52:10.160
I do a new, just launched two episodes in,

52:10.160 --> 52:12.960
a video game design podcast called Cool Games, Inc.

52:14.720 --> 52:16.240
I do one with my wife that we just launched

52:16.240 --> 52:18.160
called Schmanners, all about etiquette.

52:19.040 --> 52:22.080
Our third episode was all about conversation etiquette.

52:22.080 --> 52:24.400
And I know that we've had lots of people ask questions

52:24.400 --> 52:26.240
to my brother, my brother, and me about like,

52:26.240 --> 52:27.440
how do I small talk?

52:27.440 --> 52:28.080
Yeah, it's all there.

52:28.080 --> 52:29.200
How do I talk to people?

52:29.200 --> 52:30.720
And we cover a lot of that in there.

52:30.720 --> 52:31.600
So go check it out.

52:31.600 --> 52:34.160
And then also, I'm very proud to announce

52:34.160 --> 52:38.160
that the Things I Bought at Sheets is back.

52:38.720 --> 52:39.920
It's long hiatus.

52:39.920 --> 52:41.200
And better than fucking ever.

52:41.200 --> 52:44.400
Your last episode is a fucking barn burner.

52:44.400 --> 52:45.200
Thank you.

52:45.200 --> 52:45.920
Thank you, Griffin.

52:45.920 --> 52:48.400
It was really an emotional journey when she recorded.

52:48.400 --> 52:49.680
I'm glad it really-

52:49.680 --> 52:50.880
It made me laugh a lot.

52:51.680 --> 52:52.240
Oh, God.

52:52.240 --> 52:52.560
Well, that's-

52:52.560 --> 52:53.600
It made me think a lot.

52:53.600 --> 52:54.320
Thank you, Travis.

52:54.320 --> 52:55.280
That's what we were going for.

52:57.440 --> 52:59.600
Sheetswithazshow.com.

53:00.320 --> 53:01.680
Go to macroshows.com, baby.

53:01.680 --> 53:02.880
Yeah, it's all there, it's all there, it's all there.

53:02.880 --> 53:03.840
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's all there.

53:03.840 --> 53:05.600
I wanna thank John Roderick and the Long Winters

53:05.600 --> 53:07.200
for the use of our theme song, It's a Departure,

53:07.200 --> 53:10.080
off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

53:11.120 --> 53:12.400
He's a sweet man.

53:12.400 --> 53:15.520
And his tunes really shred.

53:16.400 --> 53:18.000
And he's a very tall man.

53:18.000 --> 53:18.400
He's a tall, sweet man.

53:18.400 --> 53:19.760
So you should listen to his music.

53:20.720 --> 53:21.840
Y'all want that final yahoo?

53:22.640 --> 53:23.520
Yes, please.

53:23.520 --> 53:24.960
This one was sent in by Zoe Kinski.

53:24.960 --> 53:25.760
Climb that ladder.

53:25.760 --> 53:27.040
Oh, just a few more rungs.

53:28.240 --> 53:29.600
Oh, oh, get in there.

53:29.600 --> 53:30.240
Thank you, Zoe.

53:30.240 --> 53:31.680
It's by Yahoo Answers users.

53:31.680 --> 53:32.880
Sorry, something has gone wrong.

53:32.880 --> 53:36.560
His avatar looks like a zwingy cartooned version

53:36.560 --> 53:38.640
of Neo from the Matrix.

53:38.640 --> 53:40.080
I'm gonna call him Neo from the Matrix.

53:40.080 --> 53:46.080
Asks, is it possible to use science from weird science

53:46.080 --> 53:48.720
to make Aaron E-surance real?

53:48.720 --> 53:55.120
My name is Justin McElroy.

53:55.120 --> 53:56.400
I'm Travis McElroy.

53:56.400 --> 53:57.280
I'm Griffin McElroy.

53:57.280 --> 53:58.800
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

53:58.800 --> 54:03.920
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

54:03.920 --> 54:18.960
Kiss your dad square on the lips.

Hello, internet.

54:25.360 --> 54:26.960
I'm Travis McElroy.

54:26.960 --> 54:28.480
And I'm Theresa McElroy.

54:28.480 --> 54:29.440
She is my wife.

54:29.440 --> 54:30.640
And he's my husband.

54:30.640 --> 54:32.560
And it is our pleasure to introduce to you

54:32.560 --> 54:33.840
a brand new podcast.

54:34.400 --> 54:35.760
Shmanners.

54:35.760 --> 54:37.440
It's extraordinary etiquette.

54:37.440 --> 54:38.960
For ordinary occasions.

54:38.960 --> 54:40.320
Theresa, let me ask you this.

54:40.320 --> 54:42.640
Can you teach me how to write a thank you note?

54:42.640 --> 54:43.600
Yes, I can.

54:43.600 --> 54:45.920
How about tips to improve my table manners?

54:45.920 --> 54:47.280
I'll do my best.

54:47.280 --> 54:49.520
And will you finally explain to me the difference

54:49.520 --> 54:52.000
between casual and business casual

54:52.000 --> 54:55.680
and cocktail and formal and black tie and all that stuff?

54:55.680 --> 54:57.760
If anybody can, I can.

54:57.760 --> 54:59.680
But like, it's going to be funny, right?

54:59.680 --> 55:00.400
Of course.

55:00.400 --> 55:03.280
I'm going to give historical origins

55:03.280 --> 55:06.880
and how those manners fit into our everyday lives.

55:06.880 --> 55:08.400
How could it not be funny?

55:08.400 --> 55:11.680
But also, sometimes we'll talk about burps and farts, right?

55:11.680 --> 55:12.800
Yeah, when not to.

55:12.800 --> 55:14.080
But we'll still talk about it.

55:14.640 --> 55:15.440
Yes.

55:15.440 --> 55:15.840
Great.

55:15.840 --> 55:18.480
So come join us for our new hilarious show.

55:18.480 --> 55:20.640
No, RSVP required.

55:20.640 --> 55:24.000
Coming to you soon every Friday on Maximumfun.org.

55:24.000 --> 55:25.600
It's Shmanners.

55:25.600 --> 55:27.360
Manners, Shmanners.

55:27.360 --> 55:27.860
Get it?
