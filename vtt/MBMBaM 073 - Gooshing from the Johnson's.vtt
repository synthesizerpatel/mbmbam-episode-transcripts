WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:52.000
Cory, Penga, the whole gang has gathered here for this, the 18th anniversary of Boy Meets World

00:52.000 --> 00:56.960
special edition of My Brother, My Brother, and Me. Name me one other character from Boy Meets World.

00:56.960 --> 01:09.680
Mr. Feeney. Sean. Travis, name me 12. Eric. The dad. The mom. Mr. Turner. Four. Minkus. Five.

01:09.680 --> 01:15.920
Oh, deep cut. Thank you. I can't remember Sean's brother. I think his name was Sean's brother.

01:16.560 --> 01:24.000
Yes, it's Sean's brother. Brotherly love. Brotherly love. Joey. Clarissa.

01:24.000 --> 01:30.880
Whole gang. Phoebe. Phoebe. Blossom. Monica was there. Family ties. Cory Feldman. What the fuck,

01:30.880 --> 01:38.720
guys? 18 years. We're celebrating. We've got confetti. We've got large pictures of Ben Savage

01:38.720 --> 01:45.200
pasted all over our walls. What an unfitting name for that gentleman, don't you think? Ben Savage?

01:45.200 --> 01:52.240
Yeah. Yeah, he's about the least fat guy that I know. Yeah, his name should be like Stephen Huggs.

01:52.240 --> 01:57.440
Did you ever see the episode, there was a special episode where his brother Fred Savage was on the

01:57.440 --> 02:03.600
show, and for some reason they decided the best thing to do with his brother was to make him a

02:03.600 --> 02:08.400
teacher that sexually harassed Topanga and have Cory throw him through a door. Yeah, I remember

02:08.400 --> 02:13.520
that. I remember watching that going, that was your play? Like you couldn't have them be like cousins

02:13.520 --> 02:19.600
or something cool and fun? Like he threw his brother through a door? Shit got Savage. Yeah.

02:19.600 --> 02:26.160
Have you seen that new ABC sitcom, Shit Got Savage? You got Ben Savage. You got Rory Savage.

02:26.720 --> 02:30.480
You got Adam Savage from Mythbusters. Yeah, and they just fucking wail on each

02:30.480 --> 02:34.240
other for a half hour every week. It's a weird show. It's not very good.

02:34.240 --> 02:37.440
No, it's not a good show. This is a good show though. It's My Brother, My Brother, Me,

02:37.440 --> 02:41.280
and the Advice Show. It's not starting out good. I thought it was pretty good. It's My Brother,

02:41.280 --> 02:44.960
My Brother, Me, and the Advice Show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

02:44.960 --> 02:49.600
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy. I'm the Ben Savage of the family, Griffin McElroy.

02:49.600 --> 02:52.000
He's the youngest, right? I think he's the littlest one, yeah.

02:53.600 --> 02:56.160
Let's get right to the questions. I'm ready to just dig in this week.

02:57.040 --> 03:05.680
I want a big mouthful of questions. Oh, the imagery. Hey, just put your questions in my

03:05.680 --> 03:09.440
mouth real quick. Just put it right there. My molars are going to grind away on your queries.

03:09.440 --> 03:15.440
My pre-wife and I are getting married. I like that. Yeah, me too. My pre-wife and I are getting

03:15.440 --> 03:20.640
married in a smaller venue for our very special day. The only problem is that people seem to

03:20.640 --> 03:25.440
think they could bring a guest to the wedding, even though only their name was on the invitation.

03:25.440 --> 03:30.400
We do not have enough space or alcohol for this nonsense. How should we drop the news?

03:30.400 --> 03:36.960
That's from no randos in North Carolina. I think what's important to note is that you can't be

03:36.960 --> 03:43.840
surprised that people think they can bring a guest, because they think that that is the norm.

03:43.840 --> 03:46.720
Well, I think that's become the norm, so I think you have to state.

03:48.160 --> 03:54.960
Is it too late to put on the invitations plus zero? Plus negative one. Don't even blame yourself.

03:56.480 --> 04:02.640
I think in this case, if you didn't clarify on the invitation, I think if this is the situation,

04:02.640 --> 04:05.840
invite yourself in. You've got to reach out to those people. You've got to call them or email

04:05.840 --> 04:10.160
them or probably email. And that's nice and impersonal to say, hey, no, I wasn't clear.

04:10.800 --> 04:16.560
They made this bed. They have to sit on laps at the church when it's time to go. I'm assuming

04:16.560 --> 04:20.400
you're getting married at a church. Otherwise, it doesn't count. And so they got a lap it.

04:20.400 --> 04:25.600
That's all. That's the choice. That's the business. Is this a situation in which they should kind of

04:25.600 --> 04:30.560
maybe expect it when they tell someone like, hey, you can't bring your S.O., then that person might

04:30.560 --> 04:40.160
not come? I honestly, it is assumed if you invite someone and they're married or in a couple even,

04:40.160 --> 04:44.560
like they're going to bring someone else. Like that's just the price of doing business.

04:44.560 --> 04:50.400
Come celebrate our special bond alone. We want you to think about what you don't have at the moment

04:50.400 --> 04:56.400
and what we do. We don't want anybody's love distracting from our love. Yeah, it's like you

04:56.400 --> 05:01.040
can't wear white and you can't hold hands at a wedding because it's not your time. It's not

05:01.040 --> 05:06.160
your desperately alone. You could just announce that your wedding is standing room only. We're

05:06.160 --> 05:11.920
packed. We're sold out. Yeah, it's a crazy wedding. This is Bieber's wedding. Bieber and Kim Kardashian

05:11.920 --> 05:17.200
got married. I never thought it would work between the two of them. And you know, there's something

05:17.200 --> 05:22.240
there. It's magical. I'll tell you what there is between them. And that's about two and a half feet

05:22.240 --> 05:31.200
of height room. He would have to climb her like shadow of the Colossus to please her.

05:34.080 --> 05:40.080
Like a midget changing a light bulb in a lamp post. It would be a weird scene. All kinds of

05:40.080 --> 05:45.440
shenanigans. All kinds of things going on in that relationship. Where's that reality TV show

05:45.440 --> 05:50.480
of that non-existent relationship? How about a Hollywood? Yeah, you got to assume people are

05:50.480 --> 05:54.880
going to bring in guests. Like I, there are a lot of things that if they said you can come,

05:54.880 --> 06:00.800
but your wife can't like, I probably wouldn't come. Like that's kind of just shitty. I'm sorry

06:00.800 --> 06:05.920
to be the one to break this to you, but this is why you plan on like, you don't count on

06:07.200 --> 06:15.680
300 lonely hearts coming to your shindig. Um, well they probably, they probably did take into

06:15.680 --> 06:20.480
account. I mean, you, you remember how meticulous it was planning, uh, who to invite for your, for

06:20.480 --> 06:27.520
your wedding. They probably did plan on couples, established couples and marrieds and datings. Um,

06:27.520 --> 06:33.360
but they didn't want like, you know, Roger to bring his friend from work, you know,

06:33.360 --> 06:40.320
I don't think this is okay. To be fair in my, in my wedding, I wasted a lot of my invitations on

06:40.320 --> 06:50.880
people like Mr. T and the Harlem Globetrotters. Yeah. You got to send those out because one of

06:50.880 --> 06:55.280
them is going to say yes. Yeah. Maybe the Voltron's like, I don't have anything going on that weekend.

06:55.280 --> 07:02.560
I'll be there. No big deal. The car from Knight Rider shows up. Um, I think you just got to take

07:02.560 --> 07:07.280
your lumps. Yeah. Cause I think the problem is even if you like planned on married couple and

07:07.280 --> 07:12.720
dating couple to expect like that single lonely guy to show up by himself knowing that there's

07:12.720 --> 07:18.480
going to be married couples and dating couples there. It's like, but not you. Who's he going to

07:18.480 --> 07:27.200
meet? Someone married. One of them bride ladies, brides, bridals. And that's the situation you're

07:27.200 --> 07:33.600
setting up though is infidelity, which I think is kind of fucked up at a wedding, you know? Yeah.

07:33.600 --> 07:42.000
It's supposed to be about vows and shit. Eternal love. Not, not sex. Not sexist. Not sex. Hey,

07:42.640 --> 07:49.200
on the subject of sending gifts, should I send presents to my SO's family? If to be frank,

07:49.200 --> 07:54.400
they did not send any to me. That's from Brett's lady. This is one of the toughest questions

07:55.040 --> 08:01.200
in dating. The question, the answer is yes. Like why not? Why wouldn't you? They didn't send any to

08:01.200 --> 08:06.000
her. Yeah. Oh, that's a good, good point. No, I mean, send them some soap or some shit. Like

08:06.000 --> 08:09.760
send them some soap. Just let them know that they are in your mind. I think we talked about it

08:09.760 --> 08:15.040
before, but giving gifts is like, especially, I don't know how long you've been dating your SO,

08:15.040 --> 08:21.200
but especially early on is one of the like toughest challenges of like the beginning of

08:21.200 --> 08:27.840
a relationship where you go, do I get them a gift that's very personalized or do I get them something

08:27.840 --> 08:33.440
that's safe? And I know that like, you know, I don't know, like a popcorn tin, like something

08:33.440 --> 08:38.800
that I know they're going to like. I would rather, I would rather them not have a gift than have the

08:38.800 --> 08:42.480
gift of guilt, which is what you're giving them. If you get them a present and they didn't get you

08:42.480 --> 08:47.600
one, but you always run that risk of like, maybe they didn't think you were going to get them

08:47.600 --> 08:53.600
anything. And so now it's just this like unspoken, like, well, we didn't get anything for each other.

08:53.600 --> 08:57.920
I don't know. It's so tough because you don't want to make them feel bad, but at the same time,

08:58.720 --> 09:02.160
maybe you need to break the cycle. How are you going to make them feel bad if they get a present?

09:02.160 --> 09:05.600
How do you feel? Because they didn't get you a present. Fuck that. They'll be so excited to get

09:05.600 --> 09:10.000
a present that they'll just be like, ooh, present. Who does it like a shiny present? Just go to,

09:10.000 --> 09:15.280
go to stop overthinking it. Just go to Pier 1 Imports and buy them one of those wicker basketballs.

09:15.280 --> 09:21.280
Imagine gift to the Magi and the woman's like, I sold my hair to get you this wash chain. He's

09:21.280 --> 09:27.120
like, oh cool. That'll go great with my watch. Oh man. That was very thoughtful of you.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.400
But listen, I'm going to need a new lady. You're bald.

09:32.320 --> 09:36.080
Hey, I'm just looking at my watch. It looks like it's time to get a new girlfriend.

09:38.560 --> 09:46.880
Out of the way, Lex Luthor. That trade-off is not very fair, is it?

09:46.880 --> 09:54.480
Hey Vicky, me and Hellraiser split up. Yeah. I got a new chain too.

09:56.640 --> 09:59.680
I said, there's the door, Willy Willy. Thanks for the watch.

10:02.240 --> 10:07.040
Oh man. What horse shit? Yeah. I sold my watch. What did you do? Oh, you're bald now.

10:07.600 --> 10:10.720
That's rough. Yeah, but his watch isn't going to grow back. Yeah.

10:10.720 --> 10:15.600
That's true. Yeah. Cause he had his watch gland removed.

10:17.680 --> 10:20.400
You got to go to Pier One. Got to get him a wicker basketball.

10:21.280 --> 10:25.200
Bitches love that shit. And by bitches, I mean this person's parents.

10:26.560 --> 10:31.680
People do love, people love getting presents and you're, you're probably are overthinking it,

10:31.680 --> 10:37.760
Breath Lady. Just, Brett needs you to buy his parents a thing. And then, you know what?

10:37.760 --> 10:43.040
No matter what it does for them, it'll make him think a lot of you and, and that relationship.

10:43.040 --> 10:46.560
Ooh. Ooh. What about this? Get them the present. And they're like,

10:46.560 --> 10:49.520
oh, we didn't get you anything. Say you already got me the greatest present.

10:49.520 --> 10:52.400
Don't fucking do that. Don't do that at all.

10:52.400 --> 10:54.640
Just the right size. No. Cause if you say that,

10:55.280 --> 10:59.680
if you say that, then they won't buy you gifts anymore. They'll be like, oh, check it.

10:59.680 --> 11:03.600
We got you Brett again. You're welcome. You want to return him? I'll get you,

11:03.600 --> 11:07.120
get you a wicker basketball. Those things are so great. I got one that smells like

11:07.120 --> 11:12.240
semen and sorry. That put it in a bowl. It smells like seven and all the time.

11:12.240 --> 11:13.040
What does it smell like?

11:14.400 --> 11:16.960
Smells like fresh rolls. Do you guys want a Yahoo answer?

11:16.960 --> 11:20.480
Yes. I have one. How did Griffin just say cinnamon?

11:21.360 --> 11:27.760
This one was sent in by Justin Russo. Thank you, Justin Russo. You're a gentleman

11:27.760 --> 11:31.760
and a scholar. It's asked by Yahoo answers user Buck Peters who asks.

11:31.760 --> 11:37.520
Come on now. What a power name.

11:38.400 --> 11:41.280
Buck Peters asks whatever he wants to.

11:45.440 --> 11:50.800
Is it weird to watch porn with nine other dudes with surround sound and order pizza for the event

11:50.800 --> 11:57.200
like with sports? Cause that's what's happening at our bachelor pad right now. We started off

11:57.200 --> 12:01.360
with four guys. Now the neighbor and his buddies came over and it's nine guys watching porn,

12:01.360 --> 12:06.320
drinking beer and eating pizza. If my buddy Seth and his two other buddies come over,

12:06.320 --> 12:08.560
that'll bring the tally of this party to 12 dudes.

12:09.280 --> 12:10.240
Oh my Jesus.

12:10.240 --> 12:13.200
There's a question mark like mathematically. Yeah. Yeah. You got it.

12:13.920 --> 12:17.280
Should we invite some girls to balance out a possible sausage fest?

12:18.720 --> 12:20.320
A possible sausage fest?

12:20.320 --> 12:24.960
You can't invite girls from now until the end of linear time.

12:24.960 --> 12:27.440
Not one is going to darken the door of that party.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.200
So here's the setup.

12:29.200 --> 12:34.720
There's so many question marks in this question where question marks didn't need to be like,

12:34.720 --> 12:38.800
yeah, you got 12 goddamn dicks. It's a sausage fest. Also,

12:38.800 --> 12:42.000
you're eating pizza with probable sausage on it.

12:42.000 --> 12:42.400
I'm going to go.

12:43.280 --> 12:45.280
This is like sausage woodstock.

12:45.280 --> 12:45.680
Yeah.

12:45.680 --> 12:49.520
You called all the sausage together for nine miles.

12:49.520 --> 12:51.200
And there's sausage on the TV too.

12:51.200 --> 12:52.320
Wouldn't you imagine?

12:52.320 --> 12:52.560
Yeah.

12:52.560 --> 12:53.120
Some dude.

12:53.920 --> 12:58.320
Do you know what my biggest problem with this setup is? The surround sound aspect.

12:58.320 --> 12:58.880
Yeah.

12:58.880 --> 12:59.440
What was that?

12:59.440 --> 13:00.080
Yeah.

13:00.080 --> 13:01.600
There's a dick right behind my head.

13:01.600 --> 13:03.840
I feel like there's just a dick on my shoulder.

13:03.840 --> 13:05.760
Is there someone gooshing behind my head?

13:07.520 --> 13:09.280
Phillip, are you gooshing?

13:09.280 --> 13:10.560
Yeah, go. Don't say that.

13:13.920 --> 13:18.320
How's this become like a regular, like it's Thursday, poor night again.

13:18.320 --> 13:21.600
Like what the hell is the matter with an event?

13:22.240 --> 13:24.800
Don't you call it an event.

13:24.800 --> 13:26.000
Only not with sports.

13:26.000 --> 13:30.160
Looks like looks like that penis is winning against the vagina.

13:30.160 --> 13:33.920
He could go all the way.

13:33.920 --> 13:34.880
Surround sound.

13:35.760 --> 13:36.640
Perfect choice.

13:37.680 --> 13:38.180
Gross.

13:39.840 --> 13:40.560
I don't get it.

13:41.120 --> 13:47.680
Of course, it's like this is this is the thing where it like it makes us sound like

13:48.960 --> 13:52.400
we're going to be like like we're homophobic and it's not it.

13:52.400 --> 13:55.520
It's that you're not embracing your own thing.

13:55.520 --> 13:58.240
Like you're not embracing your own identity.

13:59.120 --> 14:03.280
Let's look at it through the eyes of the pizza guy who rolls up and delivers your pizza.

14:03.280 --> 14:03.520
Yeah.

14:03.520 --> 14:07.840
And he swings up the door and he's just like, I'm going to go.

14:07.840 --> 14:08.800
I don't know what this is.

14:10.560 --> 14:13.280
There are porn sounds coming from every corner of your room.

14:14.880 --> 14:16.720
Is this like 9.1?

14:16.720 --> 14:18.160
Jesus, how many speakers are there?

14:18.160 --> 14:20.480
I heard your house gooshing from the Johnsons.

14:22.080 --> 14:23.280
Wait a minute.

14:23.280 --> 14:25.200
Wait one goddamn second.

14:25.200 --> 14:29.040
Can you please never say the phrase gooshing from the Johnsons?

14:30.720 --> 14:31.280
I can.

14:31.280 --> 14:33.440
I mean, like, I can't make any promises, but I'll do what I can.

14:33.440 --> 14:34.640
Psychically unpleasant.

14:37.200 --> 14:37.840
That bad, huh?

14:38.560 --> 14:42.320
I thought maybe it was, I don't know, evocative, I would say.

14:42.320 --> 14:44.080
12 dicks is too many dicks.

14:44.080 --> 14:44.880
I'm sorry.

14:44.880 --> 14:45.600
I don't care.

14:45.600 --> 14:48.800
Sexual preference doesn't even even it's not part of it at that point.

14:48.800 --> 14:50.400
That part it's fucking feng shui.

14:50.400 --> 14:54.560
Like you have 12 dicks in one room all watching porn and also pizza.

14:54.560 --> 14:55.360
Pizza, guys.

14:55.920 --> 14:57.920
Greasy, slimy pizza.

14:57.920 --> 15:00.000
Don't just don't put it away.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.280
Put all of it away.

15:01.280 --> 15:05.280
This is how you know it's not a if the question was, is this gay?

15:05.280 --> 15:08.240
Like, no, because a gay person would never go to that.

15:08.240 --> 15:10.800
Yeah, that sounds like the worst thing.

15:10.800 --> 15:12.880
Yeah, I mean.

15:13.760 --> 15:16.160
There are new movies coming out all the time.

15:16.160 --> 15:17.760
Did you watch Avatar?

15:17.760 --> 15:19.680
Yeah, what the fuck is the matter with you?

15:20.320 --> 15:21.360
Nothing else on.

15:21.360 --> 15:22.880
Guess I better watch some porn.

15:22.880 --> 15:26.560
Get everybody in the minivan and just go see Contagion or something.

15:27.360 --> 15:30.080
Hey, hey, did you and your friends watch Downton Abbey yet?

15:30.080 --> 15:32.000
It's starting up second season.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.280
Just just torrent it.

15:33.280 --> 15:35.760
Don't get a bunch of porno and watch it together.

15:36.720 --> 15:37.040
I don't know.

15:37.040 --> 15:42.400
It's like a secret shame that I think it would be equivalent of me and my friends are

15:42.400 --> 15:45.280
bathrooming in the same bathroom with 12 toilets.

15:45.280 --> 15:45.760
We love it.

15:45.760 --> 15:46.800
The doors open.

15:46.800 --> 15:48.000
Ricky's playing guitar.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.520
Jimmy's roasting marshmallows.

15:49.520 --> 15:53.520
We are all just stacked from stem to stern.

15:53.520 --> 15:54.160
Bowling.

15:54.160 --> 15:55.040
Floor to ceiling.

15:55.040 --> 15:55.680
Just beaming.

15:57.520 --> 15:58.560
People are the worst.

15:58.560 --> 15:59.280
People are the worst.

15:59.280 --> 16:00.800
Don't watch porn together.

16:00.800 --> 16:01.920
Watch it alone.

16:01.920 --> 16:02.880
Don't even do that.

16:04.320 --> 16:05.520
At least don't tell us about it.

16:06.080 --> 16:07.600
Did anybody have any answers?

16:07.600 --> 16:08.640
Any advice?

16:10.800 --> 16:15.680
Yeah, Chrissy says, just keep an eye on anyone taking a long bathroom break.

16:15.680 --> 16:18.800
If it's your house, hire someone else to clean your bathroom tomorrow.

16:18.800 --> 16:20.960
And to which the asker responded chewed at.

16:21.680 --> 16:26.960
Hey, both of you, but both of you answer and question.

16:26.960 --> 16:28.400
I mean, Travis, he has a good point.

16:28.400 --> 16:30.640
That's the that's the main problem when you're throwing us around.

16:30.640 --> 16:35.760
Sound porno pizza experience because you don't want you don't want, you know,

16:37.120 --> 16:40.480
strands of just seed hanging from the ceiling when you're done.

16:40.480 --> 16:44.160
Oh, yeah, because it's so the experience would be so erotic.

16:44.160 --> 16:48.320
They'd had a rush to the bathroom and go to not as much as I don't understand this

16:48.320 --> 16:51.360
idea of like group think watching porn together.

16:52.480 --> 16:55.280
Isn't porn like a means to an end?

16:55.280 --> 16:58.960
It's not like I love the story and the character development was awesome.

16:58.960 --> 17:00.320
Let's watch it again.

17:00.320 --> 17:05.680
You know, like, I don't get this idea of like just chased 12 dudes just sitting around

17:05.680 --> 17:06.960
eating pizza watching porn.

17:06.960 --> 17:07.760
I don't I don't know.

17:07.760 --> 17:12.240
Trust me, that's a pretty broad generalization, which do you guys remember?

17:12.240 --> 17:16.160
Scorsese directed one of the butt slammer's and I can't remember which one.

17:16.160 --> 17:20.000
It was butt slammer's 12, whichever one had Leonardo DiCaprio in it.

17:20.000 --> 17:23.760
I remembered it was in the low tens, but you got to be careful.

17:23.760 --> 17:24.080
Yeah.

17:24.080 --> 17:24.400
Yeah.

17:24.400 --> 17:25.520
Leo showed up.

17:26.080 --> 17:26.320
Yeah.

17:27.040 --> 17:29.360
And he slammed all the butts.

17:29.360 --> 17:30.400
All the butts.

17:30.400 --> 17:31.280
Yowza.

17:31.280 --> 17:31.520
Yeah.

17:33.280 --> 17:36.880
I've been dating this girl for a few weeks now and she's borderline perfect.

17:37.440 --> 17:43.840
The only thing that concerns me is that she's more into me than I am into her.

17:43.840 --> 17:46.880
Any advice concerned in Connecticut?

17:46.880 --> 17:47.200
Yeah.

17:47.200 --> 17:49.520
So your problem is she's almost perfect.

17:49.520 --> 17:51.280
If only she didn't like you so much.

17:51.920 --> 17:52.880
Here's the thing.

17:52.880 --> 17:54.960
Oh, to have your problems.

17:54.960 --> 17:57.040
That must be so rough.

17:57.040 --> 17:57.840
Almost perfect.

17:57.840 --> 17:58.480
See, I want to close.

17:59.280 --> 18:01.280
She might not be close to that borderline.

18:01.280 --> 18:06.640
You know, she might have half a face started like right at sideways.

18:06.640 --> 18:08.320
Like nothing below the nose.

18:08.320 --> 18:09.360
What are you talking about?

18:09.920 --> 18:11.760
I'm saying she's almost perfect.

18:11.760 --> 18:14.960
Yeah, the almost perfect thing is that the only problem with her is that she likes him

18:14.960 --> 18:15.520
too much.

18:15.520 --> 18:16.800
This question makes me so angry.

18:18.160 --> 18:23.120
I know I'm trying to recuperate because like when people say that, when people are like,

18:23.120 --> 18:24.880
she's more into me than I am into her.

18:24.880 --> 18:26.400
That's a self-fulfilling prophecy.

18:26.400 --> 18:28.800
It's because you are less into her than she is into you.

18:28.800 --> 18:30.240
So she's pushing.

18:30.240 --> 18:33.280
She's fighting to try to get you on the same level.

18:34.080 --> 18:35.360
Right now the ball's in your court.

18:35.360 --> 18:36.880
You need to give her the ball.

18:36.880 --> 18:37.520
Yeah.

18:37.520 --> 18:41.440
You are not playing teamwork style.

18:41.440 --> 18:42.240
You are not.

18:42.240 --> 18:45.920
I don't know any more basketball references, but no teamwork style.

18:45.920 --> 18:46.560
That was a good one.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.560
We're going to go into this with a teamwork style defense.

18:51.760 --> 18:56.560
What you got to do, you got to get Bugs Bunny to pass it to Bill Murray and slam jam it

18:56.560 --> 18:57.360
on the Monstars.

18:58.160 --> 18:58.880
That's right.

18:58.880 --> 19:00.000
That's the only basketball.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.200
And also, Wayne Knight is there.

19:01.200 --> 19:02.400
Wayne Knight is there also.

19:02.400 --> 19:07.520
And he drinks Michael Jordan's special stuff, which man, that movie is pretty suggestive

19:07.520 --> 19:08.560
now that I'm older.

19:08.560 --> 19:20.320
Yeah, I think Travis makes a rare great point that she is trying to compensate.

19:22.080 --> 19:23.360
She feels things not working.

19:23.360 --> 19:25.040
She feels you're not putting the energy into it.

19:26.720 --> 19:31.680
I don't know what this I don't like her is, but if she is borderline perfect and you don't

19:31.680 --> 19:34.720
like her to your full capacity, that's a problem with you.

19:35.280 --> 19:35.520
Yeah.

19:35.520 --> 19:38.640
I got this sweet, perfect angel.

19:39.360 --> 19:43.600
Only problem, though, is that I want somebody who's terrible for me.

19:43.600 --> 19:44.480
Yeah, right.

19:44.480 --> 19:49.360
It's one of those things whenever someone says, you know, I should really like her,

19:49.360 --> 19:50.080
but I don't.

19:50.080 --> 19:52.080
OK, well, then you don't.

19:52.080 --> 19:55.920
So I think you need to analyze like what your real problem is.

19:56.560 --> 19:59.200
And maybe she's not quite as perfect for you as you think.

19:59.200 --> 20:02.400
Or you don't appreciate her on the level that you should.

20:02.400 --> 20:07.520
There's something stopping you from being happy in this relationship.

20:07.520 --> 20:11.200
What do you think it is, you guys, without any information about this person whatsoever,

20:11.200 --> 20:13.440
except for a pseudonym they provided with us?

20:13.440 --> 20:14.400
They live in Connecticut.

20:14.400 --> 20:17.680
Do you think that maybe their apple orchard has had a rotten harvest?

20:19.520 --> 20:21.360
No, I think that's a definite possibility.

20:22.320 --> 20:27.520
I think it's that I think it's that they've only been dating for a few weeks and that

20:27.520 --> 20:33.680
people in this day and age have a tendency to rush from dating to like we are boyfriend,

20:33.680 --> 20:37.920
girlfriend, and they don't take the time to like actually get to know each other

20:37.920 --> 20:39.760
and figure out if they're perfect for each other.

20:39.760 --> 20:41.520
They just kind of jump into it.

20:42.240 --> 20:44.240
Yeah, but that's not that's not that.

20:44.240 --> 20:45.040
No, I disagree.

20:45.040 --> 20:45.600
I don't know.

20:45.600 --> 20:46.480
It's not always bad.

20:46.480 --> 20:51.840
It's not always bad, but it's this idea of it's never put someone on a pedestal.

20:51.840 --> 20:52.720
She's not perfect.

20:52.720 --> 20:54.080
No one's perfect.

20:54.080 --> 20:54.720
What like?

20:54.720 --> 20:58.720
No, yeah, I think that that's the problem.

20:58.720 --> 21:00.720
You're saying that the problem.

21:00.720 --> 21:03.920
The reason he doesn't like her is because he thinks that she's perfect.

21:04.720 --> 21:06.320
Well, I think he doesn't know her well enough.

21:06.320 --> 21:07.440
You've done lost the plot.

21:07.440 --> 21:08.960
You have no, no, no.

21:08.960 --> 21:12.240
I'm saying if you think she's perfect, maybe you don't well know her well enough.

21:12.240 --> 21:15.360
Maybe you guys just need to have some more conversations.

21:16.240 --> 21:17.120
I'm saying it's his.

21:17.120 --> 21:18.880
I'd say it's this person's problem.

21:18.880 --> 21:20.640
You're putting it on this person who?

21:20.640 --> 21:26.800
Now I'm assuming that the writer of this question listens and the girlfriend doesn't.

21:26.800 --> 21:30.400
So I'm going to put the blame on her because she'll never hear me do it.

21:30.960 --> 21:32.160
Cowardly, you say?

21:32.160 --> 21:35.520
Maybe I say it's practical.

21:35.520 --> 21:37.200
Hey, why are you so amazing?

21:38.080 --> 21:42.080
Hey, you maybe need to aim even higher than almost perfect.

21:43.600 --> 21:45.600
Maybe you need to go take it to the limit.

21:45.600 --> 21:48.800
Hey, is there any way that she that you can like him less?

21:48.800 --> 21:51.920
Maybe he's okay to completely shift gears here.

21:51.920 --> 21:54.480
How do you have that conversation?

21:54.480 --> 21:55.680
Can you like me less?

21:56.400 --> 22:01.280
Yeah, I always say like communication, explain your problems and be like, hey, you like me

22:01.280 --> 22:02.320
way too much.

22:02.320 --> 22:03.920
I am clearly too awesome.

22:03.920 --> 22:07.840
I know I'm great and I'm always cooking your favorite grilled cheese sandwiches and I always

22:07.840 --> 22:10.880
drop the best Napoleon Dynamite quotes the most appropriate times.

22:10.880 --> 22:14.000
But you've got to stop liking me so much.

22:14.000 --> 22:14.880
I get it.

22:14.880 --> 22:15.600
I get it.

22:15.600 --> 22:20.400
Maybe it's it's time for you to, I don't know, just lower the bar a little bit.

22:20.400 --> 22:24.640
Yeah, you got to like next time you're smooching her, maybe he's being too great.

22:24.640 --> 22:29.920
Yeah, maybe he forgets a dinner date, stands her up once or twice.

22:29.920 --> 22:32.720
Well, no, no, no, no, no, nothing that disrespectful.

22:32.720 --> 22:36.080
I'm saying next time you're smooching her, maybe you burp a little bit.

22:39.600 --> 22:44.160
Maybe you invite her to a 12 man straight off jerk off festival.

22:44.160 --> 22:48.320
Like a, like a summer jerk off festival.

22:48.320 --> 22:50.000
Jerk off fest 2011.

22:50.000 --> 22:50.320
Yeah.

22:50.320 --> 22:50.880
Jerkeroo.

22:51.600 --> 22:52.480
Jerkerpalooza.

22:53.600 --> 22:54.480
Jerker shoot.

22:54.480 --> 23:01.280
Maybe make it, maybe make a offhanded comment about, um, tomorrow's underwear changing day.

23:01.280 --> 23:02.400
Just mention it.

23:02.400 --> 23:04.640
Actually I've been waiting for so long.

23:04.640 --> 23:06.160
Oh, time's up.

23:07.200 --> 23:08.720
Um, maybe talk about your mites.

23:08.720 --> 23:13.360
Say bed bugs.

23:13.360 --> 23:14.720
Say something about bed bugs.

23:14.720 --> 23:16.160
You don't even have to like do a sentence.

23:16.160 --> 23:20.400
You can just say the words bed bugs and you drop like two rungs.

23:20.400 --> 23:21.280
Here's the thing.

23:21.280 --> 23:22.000
Smother her.

23:22.720 --> 23:24.240
Not, no, wait a minute.

23:24.240 --> 23:24.720
Come back.

23:25.760 --> 23:26.560
Not like that.

23:26.560 --> 23:27.760
Put that pillow down.

23:27.760 --> 23:28.880
Put that pillow down.

23:28.880 --> 23:31.520
That would fix your problem, but not really in the way that you need.

23:32.560 --> 23:34.160
It would create some new problems.

23:34.160 --> 23:34.480
Yeah.

23:34.480 --> 23:35.840
With the law, Johnny law.

23:35.840 --> 23:38.080
A new one with Johnny law to deal with.

23:38.880 --> 23:45.680
Um, I really, can I, can I, I, I, in, in the serious advice realm, I would say that

23:45.680 --> 23:49.280
if you hang in there with this relationship and you really care about this girl,

23:49.280 --> 23:52.160
these things will, um, uh, balance out.

23:53.440 --> 23:54.640
But he doesn't care about it.

23:54.640 --> 23:56.080
You'll find an equilibrium.

23:56.080 --> 23:56.320
What?

23:56.320 --> 23:57.360
He's, he's bored.

23:57.360 --> 23:58.240
He's bored.

23:58.240 --> 24:00.400
Yaw, no thanks perfection.

24:00.400 --> 24:01.680
Too perfect.

24:01.680 --> 24:04.960
I'm saying Griffin has already turned on this question asker and I'm trying to give him a way

24:04.960 --> 24:05.360
out.

24:05.360 --> 24:06.000
You know what I'm saying?

24:06.000 --> 24:06.480
Just chill.

24:07.360 --> 24:10.480
If she's perfect, he shouldn't have any problems staying in the relationship.

24:10.480 --> 24:14.080
It should be a joy, a delight, unless there's something he's not telling us.

24:14.720 --> 24:16.880
Half a face vampire.

24:16.880 --> 24:18.240
Half a face vampire.

24:18.240 --> 24:19.120
Half face vampire.

24:19.120 --> 24:23.280
She sucks other faces to get the other half of her face.

24:23.280 --> 24:24.240
Is that a thing?

24:24.240 --> 24:24.640
Yeah, sure.

24:24.640 --> 24:25.200
Yeah.

24:25.200 --> 24:25.520
Yeah.

24:25.520 --> 24:27.680
It's probably a series on the BBC.

24:27.680 --> 24:27.920
Yeah.

24:27.920 --> 24:28.800
That's what it's about.

24:28.800 --> 24:33.200
Half face vampires take out and Netflix.

24:33.200 --> 24:35.840
It's not an appropriate second date, right?

24:36.400 --> 24:40.320
I just started dating a guy who's recently out of a long-term relationship and he's jumping

24:40.320 --> 24:41.280
into a comfort level.

24:41.280 --> 24:42.480
We have not reached yet.

24:43.040 --> 24:46.000
How can I get him to back off without being too harsh?

24:46.000 --> 24:47.040
Form spring.

24:47.040 --> 24:47.520
Yikes.

24:48.320 --> 24:48.800
Yikes.

24:49.440 --> 24:50.160
Oh buddy.

24:51.600 --> 24:52.800
Can you put them on the line?

24:52.800 --> 24:53.760
Can we talk to him?

24:54.880 --> 24:55.520
Here's the thing.

24:55.520 --> 24:59.280
I think that's not a bad second date, but it is a bad second, third, fourth, fifth,

24:59.280 --> 25:00.960
sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth and 10th date.

25:01.600 --> 25:01.920
Yeah.

25:01.920 --> 25:02.800
In a row.

25:02.800 --> 25:04.720
It also depends on what the first date was.

25:06.560 --> 25:06.880
Yeah.

25:06.880 --> 25:08.560
Well, I imagine the first date.

25:08.560 --> 25:08.960
Nobody does have a first date.

25:08.960 --> 25:09.920
With their wedding.

25:09.920 --> 25:10.320
Yeah.

25:10.320 --> 25:10.560
Yeah.

25:12.080 --> 25:12.560
No, yeah.

25:12.560 --> 25:14.720
And that's a tough conversation to have too.

25:14.720 --> 25:16.800
Like, really?

25:16.800 --> 25:22.560
You want to, I guess we can stay in and it's a little, it is kind of intimate, I guess.

25:22.560 --> 25:22.960
Yeah.

25:22.960 --> 25:23.360
Doing that.

25:23.360 --> 25:24.720
And yeah, he's, you know what?

25:24.720 --> 25:31.840
He's trying to slip into the sweat pants of stage a relationship long before he's,

25:31.840 --> 25:32.400
it's time.

25:32.400 --> 25:33.920
It's the hot pants stage.

25:33.920 --> 25:36.160
Is there a way to like jokingly bring it up?

25:36.160 --> 25:39.920
Like we're not quite in the sweat pants phase yet.

25:39.920 --> 25:40.640
Ha ha ha.

25:40.640 --> 25:42.400
Without going, hey.

25:42.400 --> 25:45.200
Put on some fucking slacks and take me out before I leave you.

25:45.760 --> 25:46.560
I'm beautiful.

25:46.560 --> 25:47.360
I'm ready.

25:47.360 --> 25:48.000
I'm ready.

25:48.000 --> 25:49.120
I'm thrumming.

25:49.120 --> 25:50.880
Your slacks are pressed.

25:52.480 --> 25:55.280
Get in the car, drive me to the dance hall.

25:56.160 --> 25:58.720
We're going to the DAV and we're going to boogie.

26:01.200 --> 26:01.600
What?

26:01.600 --> 26:02.160
Yeah.

26:02.160 --> 26:02.640
The where?

26:03.760 --> 26:05.040
The D.A.R.

26:05.040 --> 26:06.720
The Dogs of the American Revolution.

26:06.720 --> 26:07.440
Uh huh.

26:07.440 --> 26:08.640
Or maybe the Eagles.

26:08.640 --> 26:09.280
The Dotar?

26:09.280 --> 26:09.920
The Elks.

26:09.920 --> 26:10.720
The Elks?

26:10.720 --> 26:12.720
The Knights of, the KFC, the Knights of Columbus.

26:12.720 --> 26:13.840
We're going to go to the KFC.

26:13.840 --> 26:14.400
We're going to.

26:14.400 --> 26:17.760
We're going to go to the Veterans Hospital and we are going to cut a rug.

26:19.360 --> 26:20.880
Um, I, yeah.

26:20.880 --> 26:24.640
I think joking about it is that, cause there's a thing with a lot of guys.

26:24.640 --> 26:28.880
If you make a joke, he'll really take it to heart and it'll eat at him.

26:28.880 --> 26:30.800
So maybe that's the way to go.

26:30.800 --> 26:33.440
You know, just something fun like that.

26:33.440 --> 26:38.000
But don't make it too serious because I, this is going to sound weird, but you're,

26:38.000 --> 26:41.840
I think second date is too early to be having serious conversations about anything.

26:41.840 --> 26:42.160
Yeah.

26:42.160 --> 26:45.040
I don't think you can have a serious conversation about like, hey, listen, this is really,

26:45.600 --> 26:46.800
this is moving too fast.

26:46.800 --> 26:49.360
Like I would just, you know, make a casual joke about it.

26:50.000 --> 26:52.720
And that's the thing is, what's funny is it's not that it's moving too fast,

26:52.720 --> 26:54.880
so much as it's slowed down too fast.

26:54.880 --> 26:57.040
Yeah, it slowed down like really fast.

26:57.040 --> 26:59.440
Yeah, he threw, he was just revving up the engine.

26:59.440 --> 27:00.800
He threw on the brakes.

27:00.800 --> 27:01.760
Who like brings it?

27:01.760 --> 27:05.600
He's like, Hey, I got Pad Thai and we're about to stream some Downton Abbey.

27:05.600 --> 27:09.360
And I was like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

27:09.360 --> 27:10.400
Chill out.

27:11.200 --> 27:11.680
Hang on.

27:12.960 --> 27:13.680
I gots to go.

27:15.200 --> 27:16.960
That does sound like a good night though.

27:16.960 --> 27:17.680
It sounds nice.

27:17.680 --> 27:18.240
I might do that tonight.

27:18.240 --> 27:19.120
I might do that tonight.

27:19.120 --> 27:19.360
Yeah.

27:19.360 --> 27:19.840
Sounds good.

27:21.600 --> 27:22.400
God, I'm old.

27:22.400 --> 27:23.520
I'm 80 years old.

27:23.520 --> 27:25.840
This is called my brother, my brother, my octogenarian.

27:25.840 --> 27:32.240
My brother, my brother, my grandpa and his sage, sage words.

27:35.120 --> 27:39.520
Um, yeah, I think you, I think if you make a fun joke about it, I don't think it'll be that

27:39.520 --> 27:40.560
big of a problem anymore.

27:40.560 --> 27:41.120
You can get over it.

27:41.120 --> 27:48.320
See, and maybe, maybe wait to see what the third date is because maybe, yeah, maybe that's his

27:48.320 --> 27:48.640
pattern.

27:48.640 --> 27:54.000
Maybe it's like epic first date, lame second date, but then his third date is like hot air balloon

27:54.000 --> 27:55.680
ride and you're losing your mind.

27:55.680 --> 27:56.160
That's right.

27:56.160 --> 28:00.640
You're eating Thai food and watching Netflix on a laptop in a hot air balloon.

28:01.840 --> 28:05.520
Listen, I love when you took me to the fancy Italian restaurant and we watched Netflix and

28:05.520 --> 28:10.160
ate takeout at the table and then you took me to your house and we watched Netflix and ate

28:10.160 --> 28:14.160
takeout and now we're on the space shuttle and we're watching Netflix and eating takeout,

28:14.160 --> 28:15.120
but maybe change it up.

28:15.120 --> 28:16.560
This Downton Abbey is so gripping.

28:18.320 --> 28:20.000
Why do they only make seven episodes?

28:22.240 --> 28:22.800
You know what?

28:22.800 --> 28:26.320
I think you just got to take charge because this person was in a long-term relationship.

28:26.320 --> 28:32.480
They probably would be very excited to, to go out and do things that they didn't do in

28:32.480 --> 28:33.360
their last relationship.

28:33.360 --> 28:37.440
It was, if it was as sedentary as you're making it sound like, I think you just got to take

28:37.440 --> 28:41.520
charge and be like, today we're gonna, you know, go river rafting or something, something

28:41.520 --> 28:42.080
exciting.

28:42.080 --> 28:45.520
You know, I think that that person will really, really appreciate that and sort of break out

28:45.520 --> 28:48.880
of the doldrums and then, you know, try even harder to impress you.

28:48.880 --> 28:53.600
Speaking of doldrums, guys who have been in a long-term relationship for a long time,

28:53.600 --> 28:56.320
don't forget that every once in a while, you got to put the sweatpants up.

28:56.320 --> 28:58.160
You got to put on some slacks again.

28:58.720 --> 29:00.400
And do it for no reason.

29:00.400 --> 29:04.240
Don't wait till like an anniversary or birthday because then it doesn't count.

29:04.240 --> 29:05.840
It's got to be like, hey, you know what?

29:05.840 --> 29:08.000
I just realized how much I love you today.

29:08.000 --> 29:09.360
Let's go somewhere special tonight.

29:09.360 --> 29:11.920
It's, it's much like sieging a fort.

29:12.640 --> 29:16.320
The most important part in love is the element of surprise.

29:16.320 --> 29:17.200
That is correct.

29:17.200 --> 29:17.440
Yeah.

29:17.440 --> 29:20.640
Hey, uh, Griffin, do you have a, and make sure you don't make her pay for it.

29:20.640 --> 29:21.600
Don't you dare.

29:21.600 --> 29:22.640
That really kills it.

29:22.640 --> 29:26.720
Yesterday, just yesterday, my lady, I went out to a fancy dinner.

29:26.720 --> 29:33.680
I had a, um, uh, the, the sea bass, Southern style sea bass coated in polenta.

29:33.680 --> 29:34.180
Delicious.

29:34.880 --> 29:35.120
Yeah.

29:35.120 --> 29:36.080
She had the swordfish.

29:36.080 --> 29:38.800
I, uh, last night I cooked for my lady.

29:38.800 --> 29:44.320
I made her, uh, uh, salmon filets, which I stuffed with baby spinach and pine nuts.

29:44.320 --> 29:46.960
And, uh, and, uh, it was a real treat.

29:47.440 --> 29:48.000
What about you, Trev?

29:48.000 --> 29:49.120
What'd you eat last night?

29:49.680 --> 29:54.080
Uh, Teresa made me a country dinner with mashed potatoes and chicken fried steak.

29:54.080 --> 29:55.600
And damn.

29:55.600 --> 29:59.360
Can we all just, can we all hold hands across the internet and just appreciate

29:59.360 --> 30:00.960
how good our lots in life are?

30:00.960 --> 30:01.600
Yeah.

30:01.600 --> 30:05.840
I don't, I day to day, who knows, but like dinner, at least we got our dinner, right?

30:07.200 --> 30:09.040
My breakfast, I don't know what I'm going to do yet.

30:09.040 --> 30:10.080
It's still early.

30:10.080 --> 30:13.600
I wish there was some really squawky, harpy lady who was here right now.

30:13.600 --> 30:19.280
I'd be like, I ate a bowl of salad out of a bread bowl from Marie Callender's.

30:19.280 --> 30:21.360
And then it would turn into a Marie Callender's commercial.

30:21.920 --> 30:23.520
Marie Callender's is good anytime.

30:23.520 --> 30:24.480
It's good anytime.

30:24.480 --> 30:29.280
Or like a woman who's like, I ate half a Hershey bar and some bunions.

30:29.280 --> 30:34.000
Who is this Kathy-like character you're trying to cast in the show?

30:34.000 --> 30:40.160
I don't understand the sociological profile you're trying to tap into with this new character.

30:40.160 --> 30:43.520
I ate cat food because it is all I had.

30:44.720 --> 30:46.240
So a homeless person.

30:46.240 --> 30:48.640
Is this a homeless ad for Marie Callender?

30:50.080 --> 30:52.960
This actually sounds like an episode of The New Adventures of Will Christie.

30:52.960 --> 30:54.960
Marie Callender homeless delights.

30:58.000 --> 30:59.440
Cat food, surprise.

30:59.440 --> 31:01.120
Surprise, you only have cat food.

31:01.120 --> 31:03.840
Requires a microwave and now my teeth hurt.

31:03.840 --> 31:08.720
I made soup out of newspaper.

31:12.240 --> 31:14.640
Today's headline, these is delicious.

31:16.240 --> 31:20.880
Do you know where you'll be going with all the savings from Marie Callender using coupons

31:20.880 --> 31:23.920
in the mail from the newspaper that you made in the soup?

31:23.920 --> 31:24.960
With the money time.

31:24.960 --> 31:30.400
That's so awkward when you go to buy a Marie Callender homeless meal and you realize that

31:30.400 --> 31:34.400
you already made the coupons in the soup.

31:34.400 --> 31:35.040
Thank you Marie.

31:35.600 --> 31:36.720
Is this soupons?

31:36.720 --> 31:39.120
The soup that keeps on souping.

31:42.000 --> 31:50.000
Let's go to the money zone.

31:50.000 --> 31:58.000
Ethan wants to wish his girlfriend Ariel a happy 21st birthday.

31:59.520 --> 32:01.920
Today, today, today.

32:02.560 --> 32:06.960
Both in Indianapolis, both devout MB&B AM listeners.

32:06.960 --> 32:12.720
And Griffin, kind of channel Ethan and give me this next quote in the voice of Ethan.

32:14.000 --> 32:17.760
Oh yeah, so Ariel, she's a model.

32:17.760 --> 32:20.960
Oh, I'm talking like fucking the guy from Nicolas Cage.

32:24.000 --> 32:28.240
I was talking like the guy from Men in Black after he gets taken over by the alien.

32:28.240 --> 32:36.400
He's like, oh, Ariel, he says, is a model.

32:36.400 --> 32:37.600
Good, good, good get.

32:38.800 --> 32:40.560
She likes giraffes and penguins.

32:40.560 --> 32:42.240
She's hilarious.

32:42.240 --> 32:43.920
And he loves her very, very much.

32:44.720 --> 32:45.760
Happy birthday, Ariel.

32:45.760 --> 32:46.640
Happy birthday, Ariel.

32:46.640 --> 32:51.520
Go get just wasted on Arbor Mist because you can buy that now legally.

32:51.520 --> 32:53.040
Yeah, all the Arbor Mist you want.

32:53.040 --> 32:56.320
Go get some Arbor Mist in Wild Irish Rose and go crazy.

32:56.320 --> 32:57.280
They think it'd be cool.

32:57.280 --> 33:00.720
It would be a good promotion for Arbor Mist if they could somehow make it where you could

33:00.720 --> 33:02.560
drink Arbor Mist when you're 20.

33:03.440 --> 33:05.600
Just as like a warm up for real alcohol.

33:06.400 --> 33:07.760
Yeah, I thought that was Boone's Farm.

33:07.760 --> 33:08.480
It's like juice.

33:09.040 --> 33:12.640
Boone's Farm, Arbor Mist.

33:12.640 --> 33:18.560
Because let's be honest, you're drinking Smirnoff Ice at like 16 for that slow, slow ramp up.

33:19.200 --> 33:20.160
Yeah, for the slow.

33:20.160 --> 33:24.400
It just legally instituted indoctrination in the culture of alcohol.

33:24.400 --> 33:25.840
I don't think there's anything wrong with that.

33:25.840 --> 33:30.800
Hey, if you would like to be on our Jumbotron, you go to maximumfund.org

33:30.800 --> 33:34.800
forge slash Jumbotron and we'll talk about your special event or your corporation.

33:35.440 --> 33:38.640
And there are rates there and thank you for your money.

33:38.640 --> 33:42.960
And listen, don't actually drink before you're 21 unless it's like Zima.

33:44.080 --> 33:47.120
Or you're being pressured to.

33:47.120 --> 33:49.840
If you're being pressured to drink a Four Loko, that's fine.

33:50.480 --> 33:51.280
That's fine.

33:51.280 --> 33:53.440
Especially if it's by a member of the opposite sex.

33:54.000 --> 33:54.720
Oh yeah, yeah.

33:54.720 --> 33:55.600
Who's older than you?

33:56.960 --> 33:58.080
Because you might get the smooch.

33:59.120 --> 34:00.320
Don't actually drink Four Loko.

34:00.880 --> 34:03.200
I'm 24 and I don't think I can handle one of those things.

34:03.920 --> 34:06.000
And listen, I saw it on Twitter last night.

34:06.000 --> 34:09.600
Oh yeah, he's drinking trash monkeys.

34:09.600 --> 34:10.960
I can't stress enough.

34:11.680 --> 34:13.520
Don't drink trash.

34:13.520 --> 34:14.880
It was a fun little short story because she's like,

34:14.880 --> 34:16.480
my boyfriend's about to drink trash monkeys.

34:16.480 --> 34:18.880
And then like two hours later, she's like, my boyfriend's dead.

34:20.800 --> 34:21.520
My boyfriend died.

34:21.520 --> 34:22.400
I miss him very much.

34:23.360 --> 34:24.480
Thanks for the advice.

34:25.040 --> 34:25.760
Thank you.

34:25.760 --> 34:27.040
Just don't drink anymore, you guys.

34:27.680 --> 34:28.960
Yeah, Griffin.

34:29.600 --> 34:30.100
Yahoo.

34:30.720 --> 34:31.360
Yes.

34:31.360 --> 34:33.600
How about another one from Mr. Justin Russo?

34:33.600 --> 34:36.240
He really knocked it out of the park this week.

34:36.240 --> 34:37.280
Thank you, Justin Russo.

34:37.280 --> 34:42.640
It's by Yahoo Answers user Vic Philadelphia Freedom who asks,

34:45.040 --> 34:45.920
this might be too gross.

34:45.920 --> 34:47.840
Let me know if it is and we'll do something else.

34:47.840 --> 34:49.920
How do you make a scrotum more attractive?

34:51.600 --> 34:52.880
I mean, if you leave it as is,

34:52.880 --> 34:55.280
it looks like a Velcro tennis ball rolled in pet hair.

34:56.160 --> 34:58.000
If you shave it, it looks like an orange

34:58.000 --> 34:59.760
that somebody forgot in the fridge for a year.

35:00.640 --> 35:02.000
How do you make it look any better?

35:02.000 --> 35:03.840
Serious answers only, please.

35:03.840 --> 35:06.800
You can make it look like a kitty with like face paint.

35:06.800 --> 35:08.160
What's the additional infographic?

35:08.160 --> 35:09.040
Additional details.

35:09.040 --> 35:10.240
Will you marry me, cat?

35:11.600 --> 35:12.400
So I don't know.

35:12.400 --> 35:14.400
Maybe he's using this as like the worst proposal.

35:14.400 --> 35:16.880
Like he was trying to genetically scientifically come up

35:16.880 --> 35:19.360
with the worst proposal ever imaginable.

35:20.560 --> 35:21.840
Because this would be it.

35:21.840 --> 35:23.280
This is pretty high on the list.

35:24.480 --> 35:26.080
This is actually an easy one to answer.

35:26.080 --> 35:27.120
What you want to do is go up to,

35:27.120 --> 35:32.160
you go up and click layer and then click filter

35:32.160 --> 35:35.520
and then click artistic and then click scrotum

35:36.480 --> 35:42.800
and then click de-speckle, de-vein and uncheck smoothing.

35:43.760 --> 35:49.680
And you're just going to want to save that as a keyboard shape.

35:49.680 --> 35:53.680
To get the TIFF or JPEG file format.

35:53.680 --> 36:01.840
If you have a TIFF, you're going to want to check in laced hair

36:01.840 --> 36:05.440
and that's going to give you a look like the pubes are woven

36:05.440 --> 36:09.360
into like a dick dicky base.

36:09.360 --> 36:12.160
Yeah, it's going to be a really nice look.

36:12.160 --> 36:14.080
I tell you what, I usually just blur it.

36:14.080 --> 36:15.600
Blur, blur, blur, blur, blur.

36:15.600 --> 36:18.480
And then I slap a mosaic filter on it

36:18.480 --> 36:22.720
and then I print that and I use it as a sort of basis

36:22.720 --> 36:23.920
for my stained glass work.

36:23.920 --> 36:25.440
You know, and we run into this a lot,

36:25.440 --> 36:28.080
but you guys are just so much more computer savvy than me.

36:28.080 --> 36:31.440
I just use paint and just kind of do a spray paint smile on it.

36:31.440 --> 36:33.680
Yeah, which is fine.

36:33.680 --> 36:34.880
That's good, I guess.

36:36.480 --> 36:37.760
I'm still using clip art.

36:37.760 --> 36:41.680
I've been looking into flash to like animate

36:41.680 --> 36:46.240
to just make it look like the left and right gonads

36:46.240 --> 36:49.040
are sort of going up and down as if it were walking down

36:49.040 --> 36:52.080
like a path, like a rose covered path.

36:52.080 --> 36:53.520
So maybe they're not any more attractive,

36:53.520 --> 36:55.280
but they're definitely more active.

36:55.280 --> 36:57.840
Yeah, well, and you can't spell attractive without active,

36:57.840 --> 36:59.040
you know, if you think about it.

36:59.040 --> 37:00.400
It's true, it's so true.

37:00.400 --> 37:01.600
Everybody get fit.

37:01.600 --> 37:02.240
Just a reminder.

37:02.240 --> 37:04.160
You thought about maybe throwing a third ball in there?

37:08.000 --> 37:09.520
Giving something they haven't seen before.

37:09.520 --> 37:12.080
Just like that classic scene in Total Recall

37:12.080 --> 37:14.880
when that girl says, baby, you made me wish I was dead.

37:17.520 --> 37:19.040
I hate your third ball so much.

37:19.040 --> 37:24.000
Oh, man, I don't think that there is a,

37:24.000 --> 37:26.560
I don't know, an equal thing for having three balls.

37:26.560 --> 37:30.320
Like, made me wish I had six fingers.

37:30.320 --> 37:31.040
I don't know.

37:31.040 --> 37:34.320
Made me wish I had left after our second date something.

37:36.080 --> 37:37.200
How about this suggestion?

37:38.880 --> 37:42.320
One sentence, get yourself an Easter egg kit.

37:42.880 --> 37:46.080
Oh, you're saying that he should dip them?

37:46.080 --> 37:50.480
Yeah, but make sure you use the wax pencil before.

37:50.480 --> 37:52.800
Yeah, because afterwards he doesn't do the designs as well.

37:52.800 --> 37:54.880
Yeah, you can write your favorite Bible verses.

37:54.880 --> 37:56.640
Don't overdo it with the glitter.

37:56.640 --> 37:59.840
You don't want it looking like a Mariah Carey video down there.

37:59.840 --> 38:02.080
Yeah, get your glitter straight.

38:02.080 --> 38:05.680
That is the most ostentatious scrotum I have ever seen.

38:05.680 --> 38:07.840
It's a little showy, okay?

38:07.840 --> 38:10.080
Listen, did you bedazzle it?

38:10.080 --> 38:10.880
What is that?

38:10.880 --> 38:13.120
We're just 12 guys trying to sit around

38:13.120 --> 38:14.640
and watch the pornography.

38:14.640 --> 38:19.600
I don't need you showing off your Elton John disco ball scrotum.

38:19.600 --> 38:22.240
Hey, get those googly eyes off there.

38:22.240 --> 38:23.280
That's ridiculous.

38:24.240 --> 38:25.360
Tyler, you have to leave.

38:26.560 --> 38:30.320
Tyler, I'm trying to eat pizza and fucking pound it and I can't do it.

38:31.440 --> 38:33.280
Oh, you've just given me a great idea

38:33.280 --> 38:37.360
for like a survivor style reality show

38:37.360 --> 38:39.520
about 12 dudes watching porn together.

38:39.520 --> 38:39.760
Yeah.

38:40.320 --> 38:41.520
Yeah, would you watch that show?

38:42.240 --> 38:42.480
No.

38:43.040 --> 38:43.760
Okay.

38:43.760 --> 38:44.560
Not at all.

38:44.560 --> 38:46.960
But you'd make a fortune off of it.

38:46.960 --> 38:47.360
Oh, yeah.

38:47.360 --> 38:51.920
Can we give these testes some utility?

38:53.760 --> 38:56.720
Can we give them function, not form?

38:57.360 --> 38:59.520
How about like a fanny pack for your balls?

39:00.480 --> 39:01.120
They have those.

39:01.120 --> 39:02.720
It's called being a transvestite.

39:02.720 --> 39:08.080
Can we please come up with something other than that?

39:08.080 --> 39:09.280
What about paperweight?

39:10.400 --> 39:11.760
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

39:11.760 --> 39:15.280
I'm not talking about something to hoist your gonads.

39:15.280 --> 39:18.640
You're saying dip them in like metal

39:19.360 --> 39:20.720
and then use them as paperweights.

39:20.720 --> 39:22.160
So just bronze them.

39:22.160 --> 39:23.600
No, no, no.

39:25.600 --> 39:28.000
Griffin, why do you want to bronze his testicles?

39:28.000 --> 39:29.040
I'm confused.

39:29.040 --> 39:30.640
It seems like while that would make them

39:31.280 --> 39:32.800
more attractive on one level,

39:32.800 --> 39:35.520
I feel like it would be a little bit painful.

39:35.520 --> 39:36.800
Yeah, it would not be pleasant.

39:36.800 --> 39:43.200
I'm, could we, ooh, could we candles?

39:43.200 --> 39:44.480
Can we turn them into candles?

39:44.480 --> 39:45.680
Like candle dip them?

39:45.680 --> 39:46.640
That wouldn't feel good.

39:46.640 --> 39:47.440
That would never mind.

39:48.240 --> 39:48.560
You know what?

39:48.560 --> 39:49.440
Neither would bronzing.

39:49.440 --> 39:50.480
Your ideas suck too.

39:52.720 --> 39:53.840
Can you have them removed?

39:55.120 --> 39:56.480
Can you have them moved?

39:57.040 --> 39:57.280
Yeah.

39:57.280 --> 39:59.280
Have them moved to a place in your body

39:59.280 --> 40:00.880
that's a little more discreet.

40:00.880 --> 40:02.080
How about on top?

40:02.080 --> 40:06.480
Stop it.

40:06.480 --> 40:07.760
Oh no.

40:07.760 --> 40:09.200
Is that Gonzo down there?

40:13.840 --> 40:15.280
He looks ridiculous.

40:16.240 --> 40:18.640
Oh, that's so crazy because mine looks like Rolf.

40:20.640 --> 40:22.160
Would you just put the balls up there

40:22.160 --> 40:23.360
or the whole thing?

40:23.360 --> 40:24.080
The whole kit and kaboom?

40:24.080 --> 40:24.400
I don't know.

40:24.400 --> 40:26.480
Is it possible to just turn the whole thing upside down?

40:26.480 --> 40:27.760
That's what I'm wondering.

40:27.760 --> 40:29.360
I don't want to do that.

40:29.360 --> 40:32.240
Can we turn it sideways?

40:32.240 --> 40:33.760
There's so many options.

40:33.760 --> 40:34.880
But it looks quizzical.

40:37.040 --> 40:37.520
Interesting.

40:38.320 --> 40:40.240
It's like when you were a kid and you cocked your,

40:40.960 --> 40:42.000
sorry for the word choice,

40:42.000 --> 40:43.840
cocked your baseball hat to the side

40:43.840 --> 40:45.520
to let people know that you were street.

40:45.520 --> 40:46.800
Oh, you got rally balls.

40:46.800 --> 40:47.040
Yeah.

40:48.320 --> 40:49.200
Come on, Reds.

40:50.960 --> 40:53.440
I turned my dick 35 degrees to the left for you.

40:54.400 --> 40:55.280
Come on, Gomez.

40:55.280 --> 40:59.520
Hit it.

40:59.520 --> 41:00.480
Oh, shit.

41:00.480 --> 41:02.640
Yahoo Answers user Nate responded to this question.

41:02.640 --> 41:04.560
He said, I have a tattoo on mine.

41:04.560 --> 41:08.160
It says, please hold with a telephone cord wrapped around it.

41:08.720 --> 41:11.280
When I get really old, hopefully it'll say something else

41:11.280 --> 41:12.240
in between the wrinkles.

41:13.840 --> 41:15.200
I have a tattoo on my penis,

41:15.200 --> 41:16.800
but that's a story for another day.

41:16.800 --> 41:18.720
Believe it or not, believe it or not,

41:18.720 --> 41:20.320
those are my only two tattoos.

41:20.320 --> 41:24.000
You, if you have two tattoos in your genitals,

41:24.000 --> 41:27.520
you are not so busy that you cannot finish answering a Yahoo answer.

41:28.400 --> 41:30.480
Nobody's that, you're not that busy.

41:30.480 --> 41:33.920
I'll catch you on Tuesday to tell you about my dick tat.

41:34.640 --> 41:36.480
Tune in to the second part.

41:36.480 --> 41:39.520
Click subscribe and you're going to get the second half.

41:40.400 --> 41:46.720
Listen, a witty tattoo on your balls is maybe, maybe, maybe funny.

41:46.720 --> 41:48.160
Like the first time,

41:48.160 --> 41:50.560
and then after that, it's just like, yeah,

41:50.560 --> 41:52.480
I still have writing on my balls.

41:52.480 --> 41:53.680
I did not think this through.

41:53.680 --> 41:55.680
Didn't think this through, but when I get older,

41:55.680 --> 41:58.080
gonna get some wrinkles, gonna say all kinds of stuff.

41:58.800 --> 41:59.520
Please kill me.

41:59.520 --> 42:00.000
Please hold.

42:00.000 --> 42:00.560
Please kill me.

42:01.120 --> 42:02.560
Free me from this flesh prison.

42:02.560 --> 42:03.760
Hello, brothers.

42:03.760 --> 42:06.640
I'm the proud father of two sons, ages 10 and six.

42:06.640 --> 42:08.320
Individually, they're great kids.

42:08.320 --> 42:10.160
Together, however, they fight and bicker

42:10.160 --> 42:11.920
during every waking second.

42:12.560 --> 42:16.400
Do you have any advice on how I can get them to at least show brotherly kindness?

42:16.400 --> 42:19.280
Rather than brotherly hurling harsh words

42:19.280 --> 42:21.520
and clenched extremities at each other.

42:22.400 --> 42:24.800
Perplexed progenitor in Indiana.

42:24.800 --> 42:25.920
This is going to be trick.

42:25.920 --> 42:28.240
Progenitor is what you meant to say.

42:28.240 --> 42:29.360
How about a brotherly cage match?

42:29.360 --> 42:30.320
Did I say progenitor?

42:30.320 --> 42:31.120
You said progenitor.

42:31.120 --> 42:31.600
Yeah.

42:31.600 --> 42:32.640
Ugh, progenitor.

42:32.640 --> 42:33.200
Sorry.

42:33.200 --> 42:34.240
I don't know what happened to me.

42:34.240 --> 42:35.760
This is going to be tough for us to answer,

42:35.760 --> 42:40.080
because we were all very docile towards each other.

42:41.040 --> 42:42.160
Not me and Justin.

42:42.160 --> 42:43.040
Do you think maybe that's it?

42:43.040 --> 42:44.240
Cause it was just two of them?

42:44.240 --> 42:45.440
No, not three.

42:45.440 --> 42:47.360
Once I came along, I was sort of the mediator.

42:47.920 --> 42:51.040
I think that this age, I think 10 and six,

42:51.040 --> 42:54.480
it's like a pack of wild dogs and they have to establish dominance.

42:54.480 --> 42:54.960
Right.

42:54.960 --> 42:55.920
Exactly.

42:55.920 --> 42:57.520
Was that really important to you guys?

42:59.040 --> 42:59.360
Yeah.

42:59.360 --> 43:01.120
No, but I think that's what brothers do.

43:01.120 --> 43:03.440
I think like there's a certain amount of, it seems,

43:04.480 --> 43:05.360
here's what it is.

43:05.360 --> 43:06.720
Oh, this is a great example.

43:06.720 --> 43:10.960
Uh, with dogs, um, when dogs like snarl at each other

43:10.960 --> 43:12.080
and like nip at each other,

43:12.080 --> 43:14.400
and chase each other, if you don't know better,

43:14.400 --> 43:16.320
you look at it and go, oh my God, they're fighting.

43:16.960 --> 43:20.240
But in reality, that's how dogs interact with each other.

43:20.240 --> 43:21.440
That's how they play.

43:21.440 --> 43:24.880
So I think that this is just the way that boys of that age

43:25.680 --> 43:26.800
are relating to each other.

43:26.800 --> 43:30.080
By the time they're 15 and however old,

43:30.080 --> 43:34.800
uh, 15 and 11 or 15 and 19, they're going to get along so well.

43:34.800 --> 43:36.320
So you got all that shit out.

43:36.320 --> 43:36.640
Sorry.

43:36.640 --> 43:38.880
Do you just want this guy to live in like a waking,

43:38.880 --> 43:40.480
screaming health the next five years?

43:40.480 --> 43:42.560
Is that what you want? Well, what dad used to do

43:42.560 --> 43:45.600
when Justin and I argued is he would like try to,

43:45.600 --> 43:48.000
you know, step it up and say, I'm going to just,

43:48.000 --> 43:49.200
I'm going to make you guys fight.

43:49.200 --> 43:50.480
And then Justin and I would always stop and go,

43:50.480 --> 43:51.520
God, that's ridiculous. Yeah.

43:51.520 --> 43:53.680
That's for foster arguing.

43:53.680 --> 43:55.280
Punch him right in the jaw.

43:55.280 --> 43:56.400
Like, I don't want to.

43:56.400 --> 44:00.960
Um, no, Sidney's mom, when Sidney and my wife,

44:00.960 --> 44:02.080
Sidney and her sister Taylor,

44:02.080 --> 44:03.760
when they would fight when they were little,

44:03.760 --> 44:07.520
her mom came up with a game called pretend your sister's dead.

44:07.520 --> 44:10.640
They would start fighting and she would drop that one on him.

44:10.640 --> 44:16.640
And, and how it would pan out is Sidney would, uh,

44:17.280 --> 44:20.160
start crying and she'd say, I'm sorry, Taylor.

44:20.160 --> 44:20.480
I'm sorry.

44:20.480 --> 44:22.480
We fought and Taylor would say, shut up.

44:22.480 --> 44:22.960
You're dead.

44:22.960 --> 44:26.400
So you never know how that's going to backfire,

44:26.400 --> 44:28.800
but they're, uh, they worked it all out.

44:28.800 --> 44:31.840
I think, um,

44:31.840 --> 44:33.760
I think, um,

44:33.760 --> 44:38.240
I think, um, I don't know.

44:38.240 --> 44:40.960
I don't, I never fought with either of you guys.

44:40.960 --> 44:42.720
I don't think maybe you're so little.

44:42.720 --> 44:44.320
We were plotting behind your back.

44:44.320 --> 44:44.640
Really?

44:44.640 --> 44:46.720
I remember this one day where I was,

44:46.720 --> 44:48.240
I was smarted off to Justin.

44:48.800 --> 44:50.320
I wasn't doing my chores.

44:50.320 --> 44:51.600
And I think that you were in charge.

44:51.600 --> 44:52.160
I could panic.

44:52.160 --> 44:54.720
The folks were away and you, you slapped me.

44:55.280 --> 44:57.120
And then I was so upset by that.

44:57.120 --> 44:58.400
And you were so upset by that.

44:58.400 --> 45:00.640
And I think that was the only confrontation we ever had.

45:00.640 --> 45:03.440
Except sometimes you would get angry

45:03.440 --> 45:05.600
when I would throw a baseball bat at you.

45:05.600 --> 45:06.880
You did throw a baseball bat at me,

45:06.880 --> 45:09.520
but that was a, that was pure accidento.

45:09.520 --> 45:09.760
Right?

45:10.400 --> 45:11.920
No, that was a game we were playing.

45:11.920 --> 45:12.880
That was taste my steel,

45:12.880 --> 45:15.120
but like, I feel like it was pure accident.

45:15.680 --> 45:18.000
And there was the time that you kind of swung Griffin around

45:18.000 --> 45:19.120
and like hammer through him.

45:19.120 --> 45:22.480
You did hammer through me like, like fucking trunchable.

45:22.480 --> 45:27.040
But we've talked about taste my steel before, right?

45:27.040 --> 45:27.920
Like, I don't think.

45:27.920 --> 45:30.000
Let's do a quick recap in case we haven't.

45:30.000 --> 45:31.600
Quick recap in case we haven't.

45:31.600 --> 45:33.680
Taste my steel is a game that I invented with Griffin.

45:34.720 --> 45:36.240
A real collaborative.

45:36.240 --> 45:38.160
No Abner Doubleday and taste my steel.

45:38.160 --> 45:39.200
It was a real collabo.

45:40.000 --> 45:42.560
Basically, I had an aluminum baseball bat

45:42.560 --> 45:44.480
and I would throw it at Griffin,

45:44.480 --> 45:46.320
but he would know it was coming.

45:46.320 --> 45:46.880
How would I know?

45:46.880 --> 45:49.760
I would say, because I would shout taste my steel.

45:49.760 --> 45:51.840
Yeah, throw the bat at him.

45:52.640 --> 45:55.040
I was, I was very live though.

45:55.040 --> 45:56.160
Yeah, wispy I would say.

45:56.160 --> 46:00.720
I was wispy and I dodged it every time except the last time that we played it.

46:01.920 --> 46:04.240
When you hit me, you hit me right in the eyeball.

46:04.800 --> 46:08.560
I got the biggest, nastiest, shiniest anyone's ever gotten.

46:08.560 --> 46:11.360
And then our mom was like, hey, don't play taste my steel anymore.

46:12.160 --> 46:13.600
So maybe that's the solution.

46:13.600 --> 46:16.320
Get your kids some weapons and let them work it out.

46:16.320 --> 46:17.760
Or don't let the commish catch you.

46:19.760 --> 46:22.800
Our mom was the commissioner of taste my steel.

46:22.800 --> 46:24.400
She got it down single-handedly.

46:24.400 --> 46:24.640
Yeah.

46:24.640 --> 46:29.840
She was the steroids of taste my steel because she ruined the purity of the sport.

46:29.840 --> 46:32.480
Travis was never allowed to play because he got caught juicing.

46:32.480 --> 46:34.560
That's right.

46:34.560 --> 46:37.120
He tried to up his taste average.

46:39.520 --> 46:41.120
Up his vibrancy.

46:41.120 --> 46:43.200
And I would have taken it and just made it violent.

46:43.200 --> 46:46.160
I would have taken out the beauty of the sport.

46:46.160 --> 46:50.640
Yeah, you would have made it less of a ranged game, more of a melee.

46:50.640 --> 46:55.680
Okay, Griffin, let's have one more Yahoo Answers question.

46:55.680 --> 46:57.280
I feel like that would go down real smooth if you got one.

46:57.280 --> 47:00.800
Okay, how about, man, it's tricky.

47:01.680 --> 47:09.440
Do you want a creepy one or do you want a more thought-provoking one?

47:10.080 --> 47:11.440
You know I like to get creepy.

47:11.440 --> 47:12.560
Yeah, give me the creepy one.

47:13.440 --> 47:14.800
This one was sent in by Grace Russell.

47:14.800 --> 47:15.360
Thank you, Grace.

47:15.360 --> 47:24.320
It's by Yahoo Answers user HIUH who asks, I want to kiss Sarah Michelle Geller on the forehead.

47:24.320 --> 47:25.040
How can I do it?

47:27.360 --> 47:28.560
Who can help me with that?

47:28.560 --> 47:32.480
Every night I'm going to bed, I'm kissing something thinking of kissing her in forehead.

47:33.040 --> 47:35.440
I also dreamed kissing her in forehead.

47:35.440 --> 47:38.160
If there is none, how can I get over that?

47:38.160 --> 47:39.120
Why do I want it?

47:40.240 --> 47:40.960
Oh, no.

47:40.960 --> 47:47.280
No, he's actually being very mature because he's not just asking how he can gill about

47:47.280 --> 47:50.160
kissing Sarah Michelle Geller right on her sweet forehead.

47:50.720 --> 47:55.600
He wants to know how he can get over it if it truly is impossible, which so few things

47:55.600 --> 47:56.320
in this world are.

47:57.440 --> 48:00.400
This may be one you don't want to do.

48:00.400 --> 48:01.520
You don't want to have to do battle.

48:01.520 --> 48:07.120
I think you have a better chance of kissing Sarah Michelle Geller square on the lips than

48:07.120 --> 48:09.440
you do on the forehead.

48:09.440 --> 48:12.560
If someone came up to her and he said, I have a proposition for you.

48:12.560 --> 48:17.280
I want to give you a kiss one of these two places, you think almost certainly would choose

48:17.280 --> 48:18.080
the lips.

48:18.080 --> 48:19.680
Yeah, not even a question.

48:20.320 --> 48:24.720
Here's the thing, and I'm not condoning this action because it's wrong, but you could kiss

48:24.720 --> 48:28.640
her on the forehead if you found her, but it would be the last thing you did of your

48:28.640 --> 48:30.960
own free will for a while because you would go do it.

48:30.960 --> 48:32.800
But how would you prosecute that?

48:33.600 --> 48:34.640
Assault, Travis.

48:34.640 --> 48:35.280
That's assault.

48:35.280 --> 48:38.000
That is assault with kiss on the forehead.

48:38.000 --> 48:40.400
Are you that would be the greatest court case?

48:40.400 --> 48:42.080
Go around kissing anybody you want to.

48:42.640 --> 48:45.520
Is that no, I believe that it is illegal.

48:45.520 --> 48:48.800
I'm saying I want to know what the actual title of that crime is.

48:48.800 --> 48:56.480
One of my friends here in Austin was talking about this this sort of criminal that that

48:56.480 --> 48:57.440
plagued their school.

48:57.440 --> 49:01.680
I think it was a university, North Carolina, and they called him the campus cuddler.

49:02.800 --> 49:04.720
I can't tell if this is funny or horrifying.

49:04.720 --> 49:05.760
It's a little bit of both.

49:05.760 --> 49:11.360
And what he would do is he would go to the dorms and look for people who were like asleep

49:11.360 --> 49:14.320
in their dorms, who left their dorm door like open or unlocked.

49:14.320 --> 49:21.040
And he would cuddle with them until they woke up and like were being cuddled with by a fucking

49:21.040 --> 49:21.680
stranger.

49:21.680 --> 49:25.760
And then he would like rubble, rubble, hamburger his way out of the room.

49:26.320 --> 49:28.000
You know what's really important in that?

49:28.000 --> 49:28.800
The dismount.

49:29.520 --> 49:34.240
If you don't have a good rubble rubble or, you know, something similar.

49:34.240 --> 49:35.840
Hey, what are you dreaming about?

49:37.440 --> 49:44.160
Rubble, rubble, waka waka, waka waka play.

49:46.320 --> 49:47.360
What's the verdict on that?

49:47.360 --> 49:49.120
I think it's the scariest thing ever.

49:49.120 --> 49:53.200
Maybe we shouldn't joke about it because I think he was a student, which makes it less

49:53.200 --> 49:56.640
creepy if it was like a sociology professor.

49:56.640 --> 49:58.160
That would be mega creepy.

50:00.400 --> 50:02.960
If it's a psychology professor, it's an experiment.

50:02.960 --> 50:04.240
Yeah, it just has.

50:06.000 --> 50:10.480
I would say that that is really funny until it happens to you or someone you know.

50:10.480 --> 50:11.600
It's assault though.

50:11.600 --> 50:15.520
So what I'm saying is if you kiss Sarah Michelle Gellar on the forehead without her permission,

50:15.520 --> 50:16.880
folks, it's a crime.

50:17.680 --> 50:20.960
Folks, I don't know how many times we have to tell you this, it's a crime.

50:21.680 --> 50:24.720
And make sure that you get permission from her in writing.

50:25.360 --> 50:28.320
Yeah, I don't want to change her mind when you start slobbering on her noggin.

50:29.520 --> 50:32.320
Yeah, but if you do get the kiss on the forehead, make it count.

50:32.320 --> 50:33.840
Yeah, cause don't do a little peck.

50:33.840 --> 50:35.840
You need to be like a barnacle up in there.

50:36.880 --> 50:38.560
Give her a forehead hickey.

50:38.560 --> 50:39.920
Do not let go.

50:39.920 --> 50:41.120
Never let go.

50:41.120 --> 50:41.920
That's your peak.

50:41.920 --> 50:42.960
You're peaking right then.

50:43.680 --> 50:46.640
Smear some superglue on your lips and go to town.

50:46.640 --> 50:48.560
Do you want to do this so soon in your life?

50:49.200 --> 50:51.120
You know, it's all downhill after you do it.

50:51.120 --> 50:52.720
Oh, you're saying like he saves it up.

50:53.360 --> 50:53.760
Save it up?

50:53.760 --> 50:56.240
And like get permission from her and then just wait.

50:56.240 --> 50:56.800
Just wait.

50:56.800 --> 51:01.280
Say like, have her send you a coupon and then redeem it when it's appropriate for you.

51:01.280 --> 51:05.120
Oh, and then she dies in like a tragic accident and it's like the worst day ever.

51:05.120 --> 51:06.400
Why would you do that?

51:06.400 --> 51:07.120
I mean, I'm just saying.

51:07.920 --> 51:10.240
I'm saying take your, take your chances now.

51:10.240 --> 51:14.320
Kiss someone on the forehead now cause you never know when they're going to die in a tragic accident.

51:14.320 --> 51:15.920
Can we somehow capitalize on this?

51:15.920 --> 51:22.480
Can we put Sarah Michelle Geller on retainer and just sort of, um.

51:22.480 --> 51:24.160
Like the creepiest kissing booth ever.

51:24.160 --> 51:24.800
Yeah, sort of.

51:24.800 --> 51:26.000
Like for charity though.

51:26.960 --> 51:27.680
Oh yeah.

51:27.680 --> 51:28.480
I like it.

51:28.480 --> 51:31.920
Here's Sarah Michelle Geller, you have to pay, I think a hundred isn't unfair.

51:32.640 --> 51:33.840
Uh, pay a hundred dollars.

51:33.840 --> 51:36.000
I think she, I think she'll set the price point.

51:36.000 --> 51:37.680
I don't want to make that decision for her.

51:37.680 --> 51:40.480
Do you think maybe we could get like a sliver of it?

51:40.480 --> 51:44.960
And by which I mean the money and not like free Sarah Michelle SMG forehead kisses.

51:44.960 --> 51:49.600
Oh well, can we just say like we'll get paid however we choose?

51:49.600 --> 51:51.840
Because I don't, I mean not hypothetically.

51:51.840 --> 51:55.600
You want 10% with an option of 5% and five kisses.

51:56.240 --> 51:56.480
Yes.

51:56.480 --> 51:58.640
Well, not me, not me.

51:58.640 --> 52:01.520
I want to leave that option open in case one of us wants that.

52:01.520 --> 52:03.280
Wants to kiss her on the brow.

52:03.920 --> 52:04.640
Yeah, but not me.

52:04.640 --> 52:08.320
I feel like we could do that without our respective significant others getting angry about it

52:08.320 --> 52:09.920
because it's like for the story.

52:11.120 --> 52:12.720
Well, mine definitely listened.

52:12.720 --> 52:15.840
So I'm going to go ahead and lean on the side of I'll take the money.

52:15.840 --> 52:16.960
Yeah, I'll take the money too.

52:16.960 --> 52:17.460
Travis!

52:19.600 --> 52:23.680
I feel like, I feel like my significant other would get mad.

52:23.680 --> 52:27.760
Not because I kissed another girl, but because I kissed someone on the forehead.

52:27.760 --> 52:29.360
I think she would just be mad in principle.

52:29.360 --> 52:30.080
That's so personal.

52:30.080 --> 52:30.880
It's the worst.

52:30.880 --> 52:31.760
Is she your daughter?

52:31.760 --> 52:33.760
Because if not, get your lips off there.

52:33.760 --> 52:35.280
Hey, I want to hear Griffin's last question.

52:35.840 --> 52:38.640
First, thank you so much for listening to our show.

52:39.200 --> 52:40.800
This is my brother, my brother and me.

52:56.160 --> 52:58.960
That helps us out a lot trying to spread the word.

52:58.960 --> 53:01.040
It seems like more people have been talking about it on Twitter,

53:01.040 --> 53:02.400
which is like infinitely exciting.

53:02.400 --> 53:04.880
And more people who are like, just started listening to mbnbam.

53:04.880 --> 53:06.640
Thanks for the recommendation, so and so.

53:06.640 --> 53:08.080
And we see those and we love them.

53:08.880 --> 53:11.680
When, and when, if you see someone say something like,

53:11.680 --> 53:15.600
maybe it's time to find out what this, my brother, my brother and me is all about,

53:15.600 --> 53:17.760
make sure you descend on them like jackals.

53:17.760 --> 53:20.480
Like, like, like a hawk, like a condom.

53:20.480 --> 53:22.880
And you gotta, and if someone asks, what's mbnbam?

53:22.880 --> 53:24.400
You gotta make sure to put that link in there.

Yeah.

53:25.200 --> 53:26.000
Just hyperlink them.

53:26.960 --> 53:27.840
Just hyperlink it.

53:28.800 --> 53:33.360
Thanks to, we got a new fan, Bile Kojima, is there tweeting about the show.

53:34.080 --> 53:35.600
Lyrical nuisance, always Amy H.

53:36.640 --> 53:37.680
Liquid paper cut.

53:37.680 --> 53:38.480
Eric the Wheeler.

53:40.240 --> 53:44.400
So many, so many people turning out to, to, to root us on.

53:44.400 --> 53:46.880
Join 11, the after field.

53:47.600 --> 53:50.800
Robot Atoms, Auntie Hot.

53:50.800 --> 53:52.240
And you know, if you have-

53:52.240 --> 53:58.480
Oh, and Nano Blossom, do appreciate Rebecca Eagle giving us the, the plug-a-roo.

53:58.480 --> 53:59.040
Thanks, Rick.

54:00.400 --> 54:02.640
If, if you're done with our show,

54:02.640 --> 54:05.840
if this is the last episode that you need to listen to,

54:05.840 --> 54:08.000
to complete your collection, to catch them all,

54:08.000 --> 54:09.600
go listen to something else on Maximum Fun.

54:09.600 --> 54:10.800
Go listen to Jordan and Jesse Go.

54:10.800 --> 54:13.040
Go listen to Stop Podcasting Yourself.

54:13.040 --> 54:14.560
Go listen to Judge John Hodgman.

54:15.360 --> 54:15.680
You're gonna-

54:15.680 --> 54:16.080
Something.

54:16.080 --> 54:17.680
I guarantee you're gonna love them.

54:17.680 --> 54:21.120
Thank you to John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of their song.

54:21.120 --> 54:23.520
It's a departure of the album Putting the Days to Bed.

54:23.520 --> 54:24.960
It's our theme song.

54:24.960 --> 54:27.680
And you should listen to all the songs on that album,

54:28.240 --> 54:30.000
because they're all very good.

54:30.960 --> 54:34.400
And if you, if you get our show off of iTunes

54:34.400 --> 54:38.480
and you haven't been checking out MaximumFun.org lately,

54:38.480 --> 54:40.240
check it out because it's updated all the time.

54:40.240 --> 54:44.560
And there's always great video clips and links to like new albums

54:44.560 --> 54:46.160
and interviews and stuff like that.

54:46.160 --> 54:47.360
And check it out.

54:47.360 --> 54:49.360
And while you're there, make sure you go to the forums

54:49.360 --> 54:52.720
and write about this show on the thread.

54:53.520 --> 54:55.280
So just to, you know what it is there?

54:55.280 --> 54:57.520
It's just a, just a think tank.

54:58.320 --> 54:59.680
Just dig in.

54:59.680 --> 55:01.120
Get into the experience.

55:01.120 --> 55:02.560
Get in the synergy and stuff.

55:03.200 --> 55:05.200
Get in the synergy and stuff.

55:05.200 --> 55:07.040
Hey, we're talking about live shows.

55:07.040 --> 55:07.680
We hear you.

55:08.400 --> 55:09.440
Yeah, we're working on it.

55:09.440 --> 55:10.560
We're working on it, I promise.

55:11.920 --> 55:15.920
It's just hard because not everybody has shared the link to our sampler yet.

55:15.920 --> 55:16.480
It's really-

55:16.480 --> 55:17.440
Yeah, it's like-

55:17.440 --> 55:20.320
It's like, we don't want to do these shows

55:20.320 --> 55:23.440
and then nobody shows up because you didn't whore us, you know?

55:23.440 --> 55:25.280
Yeah, because you are failing us.

55:25.280 --> 55:26.080
You're failing us.

55:26.080 --> 55:28.640
And like, I don't want to put the blame on anybody,

55:28.640 --> 55:30.400
but I'm gonna put it on you if I have to.

55:32.320 --> 55:34.080
So yeah, feel bad and stuff, I guess.

55:34.080 --> 55:36.000
Quit letting me down, Devin.

55:37.200 --> 55:38.080
Devin?

55:38.080 --> 55:40.960
I have a friend named Devin and I used that name last show

55:40.960 --> 55:42.720
and he thought I was talking specifically to him.

55:45.520 --> 55:46.080
Oh, shit.

55:46.080 --> 55:48.880
So anyway, thanks, Griffin.

55:48.880 --> 55:50.000
You want that final question?

55:50.000 --> 55:50.800
Is that what you want?

55:50.800 --> 55:51.440
You know I do.

55:52.400 --> 55:54.240

55:56.720 --> 55:58.000
Thank you, NyxNimby.

55:58.000 --> 56:00.480
It's by Yahoo Answers user Daniel who asks,

56:03.200 --> 56:06.160
can you grow a rose from the waters of your tears?

56:10.800 --> 56:12.000
I'm Justin McElroy.

56:12.000 --> 56:12.880
I'm Travis McElroy.

56:12.880 --> 56:14.160
I'm Griffin McElroy.

56:14.160 --> 56:16.560
If you've been my brother, my brother may kiss your dad.

56:16.560 --> 56:45.040
Square on the lips.
