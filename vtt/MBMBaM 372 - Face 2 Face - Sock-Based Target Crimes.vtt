00:00.000 --> 00:15.000
Hello and welcome to 99% Invisible, I'm Roman March.

00:15.000 --> 00:21.800
Those are the guns he has on every episode that he shoots.

00:21.800 --> 00:24.920
Facts, facts.

00:24.920 --> 00:27.000
Time to hit this story with the fact cannon.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.920
Well, then he has like a salient point introduce the fucking show.

00:31.920 --> 00:32.920
I'm dying.

00:32.920 --> 00:37.920
Hello and welcome to my brother, my brother, mean advice show for the modern era.

00:37.920 --> 00:53.320
I'm your oldest brother, Justin Tyler Mackle, and I'm Travis Patrick McElroy, your middle

00:53.320 --> 01:03.320
list brother, and I'm your sweet baby brother and 30 under 30 media luminary Griffin Mackle.

01:03.320 --> 01:07.280
There are people there are people who work at these theaters who hear me say that every

01:07.280 --> 01:12.240
night and must think I'm the biggest dong in the world.

01:12.240 --> 01:16.360
I have been listening to you all for according to our clock here three minutes and I have

01:16.360 --> 01:17.360
some breaking news.

01:17.360 --> 01:18.360
They horny for this.

01:18.360 --> 01:19.360
Yeah, sure.

01:19.360 --> 01:25.440
Apparently y'all horny for this one or what?

01:25.440 --> 01:26.760
I am horny for this one.

01:26.760 --> 01:28.960
This is the first.

01:28.960 --> 01:29.960
It sounds weird.

01:29.960 --> 01:32.800
Okay, listen, stop.

01:32.800 --> 01:39.220
Anytime I talk about being horny, if there was a lot of horniness last night, if people

01:39.220 --> 01:45.480
don't cheer after that, it gets weird so fast.

01:45.480 --> 01:47.680
It gets very strange very quickly.

01:47.680 --> 01:52.000
Yeah, I don't know why it feels more normal to describe other people's level of horniness

01:52.000 --> 01:54.120
rather than your own.

01:54.120 --> 01:57.120
Like it's okay if I say y'all horny.

01:57.120 --> 01:58.120
Yeah, that's good.

01:58.120 --> 02:06.840
But if I announce I'm horny, it's, see, but you felt it though, right?

02:06.840 --> 02:13.200
You wanted to laugh but you definitely were like, okay, I did pay for these tickets so

02:13.200 --> 02:18.160
y'all get in the seats, we're a little tripped out when we saw some of the seats facing each

02:18.160 --> 02:19.160
other.

02:19.160 --> 02:20.160
Please feel welcome.

02:20.160 --> 02:21.160
It's become dinner theater.

02:21.160 --> 02:25.760
So welcome to direct them at us.

02:25.760 --> 02:29.040
So this is My Brother, My Brother and Me, it's an advice show for the imaginary and

02:29.040 --> 02:33.760
we take your questions and turn them alchemy-like into wisdom, that's right.

02:33.760 --> 02:34.760
Before we get started.

02:34.760 --> 02:35.760
Okay.

02:35.760 --> 02:37.760
Did we not get started?

02:37.760 --> 02:38.760
No.

02:38.760 --> 02:39.760
Okay.

02:39.760 --> 02:46.160
So the first two shows we brought, Justin and I had our wives and various and thunder

02:46.160 --> 02:47.960
children with us.

02:47.960 --> 02:53.920
And tonight it's just Griffin, Justin and I, and so we decided to really party like

02:53.920 --> 02:58.040
three bachelors loose on the town.

02:58.040 --> 03:03.640
By which I mean as soon as we got here, Griffin set up his PlayStation 4 and we played Destiny

03:03.640 --> 03:04.640
2.

03:04.640 --> 03:05.640
Yeah.

03:05.640 --> 03:13.000
And no way, it gets fucking nastier because we ordered some Thai food from Seamless that

03:13.000 --> 03:17.840
took longer than we thought it would and we had to bring it to the theater and eat it

03:17.840 --> 03:19.240
in our dressing rooms.

03:19.240 --> 03:24.120
Yeah, Rachel and Henry are back at home, but you all brought your families with me and

03:24.120 --> 03:29.760
I brought a very special family member who is my best friend Crash Bandicoot, who y'all

03:29.760 --> 03:34.920
gave me so much guff because I've lugged my PlayStation 4 with me across like three

03:34.920 --> 03:37.380
state lines at this point.

03:37.380 --> 03:40.920
And they made me take it out of my bag at the airport and I wasn't ready for that.

03:40.920 --> 03:44.480
And when I opened up my bag to fetch the PS4 out of it, there was what I could qualify

03:44.480 --> 03:48.280
as an underwear explosion.

03:48.280 --> 03:49.280
But then I said-

03:49.280 --> 03:51.640
Which is also what happens every time Griffin eats buffalo wings.

03:51.640 --> 03:52.640
Yes.

03:52.640 --> 03:55.840
But then I set it up in the hotel and Justin was like, hey, can I play some Destiny 2?

03:55.840 --> 03:57.040
I was like, who's laughing now?

03:57.040 --> 04:01.680
And Crash Bandicoot appeared on the screen, he said, no, fuck you, Justin.

04:01.680 --> 04:05.360
Griffin was being really weird, Travis and I just had small bags, but we checked them

04:05.360 --> 04:09.760
because Travis is already checking one, so I figured this is fucking boring anyway.

04:09.760 --> 04:12.160
Griffin wouldn't check his and we couldn't figure out why.

04:12.160 --> 04:13.160
Because Crash was in it.

04:13.160 --> 04:14.160
Yeah, exactly.

04:14.160 --> 04:16.640
That's what we figured out eventually, like his precious PS4.

04:16.640 --> 04:21.760
He'd rather just slam it into an overhead compartment in a rush.

04:21.760 --> 04:22.760
Should we get busy?

04:22.760 --> 04:24.640
Let's get to the meat of the thing.

04:24.640 --> 04:25.640
Yeah.

04:25.640 --> 04:30.160
Now, before I read this first question, some context is important.

04:30.160 --> 04:40.600
This is a question that was sent specifically for this show on September 10th.

04:40.600 --> 04:52.080
Are you supposed to tip Christmas carolers now?

04:52.080 --> 04:53.640
Are you here?

04:53.640 --> 04:54.640
Was there a name on that one?

04:54.640 --> 04:55.640
No.

04:55.640 --> 04:56.640
No.

04:56.640 --> 04:57.640
Are you here?

04:57.640 --> 05:00.920
No, apparently they don't care that much.

05:00.920 --> 05:03.240
So there's two options.

05:03.240 --> 05:07.360
Option one is your life is very fucking chill.

05:07.360 --> 05:10.520
Yeah, you have the coolest life out there, this is the thing that you're worried.

05:10.520 --> 05:21.680
This is like number 74,210 on my list, ranking in well below climate change.

05:21.680 --> 05:26.560
The other option is you care about this a lot.

05:26.560 --> 05:29.760
You really, really care what carolers think of you.

05:29.760 --> 05:33.960
Well, because there's a possibility, I think it's easy to assume that this is like, was

05:33.960 --> 05:35.920
I supposed to tip them?

05:35.920 --> 05:40.680
But it's also possible that nine months ago, the concern might have been I did tip them

05:40.680 --> 05:43.040
and they were really weird about it.

05:43.040 --> 05:44.040
Yeah.

05:44.040 --> 05:45.520
Or that the carolers are still there.

05:45.520 --> 05:52.520
Or should I say there are like five skeletons holding out long ago melted candles and just

05:52.520 --> 05:56.800
a skeletal palm outstretched like, oh shit, stay right there.

05:56.800 --> 05:57.800
I know who can help me with this one.

05:57.800 --> 05:58.920
That's a great point, Travis.

05:58.920 --> 06:02.960
If you're worried, if you have so little to worry about that you're thinking in advance

06:02.960 --> 06:07.920
about whether or not you should tip Christmas carolers, I cannot relate to you at all.

06:07.920 --> 06:11.680
If nine months after the fact, you're still obsessing about the fact whether or not you

06:11.680 --> 06:16.600
did the right thing or not, welcome home.

06:16.600 --> 06:20.120
Yeah.

06:20.120 --> 06:21.120
You found your podcast.

06:21.120 --> 06:23.520
Where are your carats?

06:23.520 --> 06:27.920
Sometimes I will, years later, wake up in a cold sweat like, oh no, I said this and

06:27.920 --> 06:28.920
I meant that.

06:28.920 --> 06:29.920
Shit.

06:29.920 --> 06:33.040
I said you also enjoy your flight to the cab drive.

06:33.040 --> 06:34.040
That one felt relevant.

06:34.040 --> 06:37.280
We're dancing around it because I think would none of us really want to address the question

06:37.280 --> 06:38.280
here, because I don't know.

06:38.280 --> 06:41.000
Well, I actually do know, I do know the answer to this.

06:41.000 --> 06:44.720
Isn't it a pudding-based economy that they have?

06:44.720 --> 06:47.840
I took one of my collegiate classes.

06:47.840 --> 06:49.640
Oh God, here we go, here we go.

06:49.640 --> 06:52.000
I went to university.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
Always rubbing it in.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
Mom, Paul, we had minus in one of us.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.480
That's all we hear about now.

06:57.480 --> 06:58.480
College.

06:58.480 --> 07:03.000
What happened on the quad?

07:03.000 --> 07:06.680
In this history class, it was pre-Civil War history.

07:06.680 --> 07:10.560
We did a course on the war on Christmas.

07:10.560 --> 07:13.600
God, this is as boring as college was.

07:13.600 --> 07:14.600
Thank you for recreating the experience.

07:14.600 --> 07:15.600
I'm getting there.

07:15.600 --> 07:19.920
You know, the actual war on Christmas back when Christmas was outlawed in America for

07:19.920 --> 07:20.920
a while.

07:20.920 --> 07:25.320
Okay, hold on, because now I'm in.

07:25.320 --> 07:29.440
You're back in, because for a while, Christmas was all about just getting drunk and like

07:29.440 --> 07:38.840
fucking raging, and so the church outlawed Christmas, and then they brought it back.

07:38.840 --> 07:44.040
It was like new Christmas that was very family-positive, but it used to be that caroling, they would

07:44.040 --> 07:49.840
literally go door-to-door and demand money and food and gifts from you, and if you didn't

07:49.840 --> 07:56.600
deliver it, they would storm into your house and take shit.

07:56.600 --> 08:00.760
That's why in the song, there's a line that goes, we won't go until we get some, we won't

08:00.760 --> 08:01.760
go until...

08:01.760 --> 08:02.760
This sounds apocryphal.

08:02.760 --> 08:10.040
This is 100% true, so you had to keep a tray of coins by the door to throw at them and

08:10.040 --> 08:11.040
then slam the door.

08:11.040 --> 08:14.280
You had to hurry to the panic room, you were too slow to the panic room.

08:14.280 --> 08:18.840
Now I've got your Xbox and I also took your son.

08:18.840 --> 08:22.640
Now bring us your Amazon Echo, now bring us your Amazon Echo.

08:22.640 --> 08:27.120
I'm updating it, because no one has pudding anymore.

08:27.120 --> 08:34.120
How about a yahoo from the Yahoo answer service?

08:34.120 --> 08:36.040
Y'all are fucking loud and I'm loving it.

08:36.040 --> 08:37.040
This is the best.

08:37.040 --> 08:38.040
It's so good.

08:38.040 --> 08:39.040
This is our... No, no, no.

08:39.040 --> 08:40.040
Okay.

08:40.040 --> 08:42.480
You just misunderstood.

08:42.480 --> 08:44.400
You were a proper amount before.

08:44.400 --> 08:45.400
Let's just keep it.

08:45.400 --> 08:51.720
This is one of the only times... No, the only time of a venue that wasn't at home that we

08:51.720 --> 08:53.840
have played at more than once, is there?

08:53.840 --> 08:54.840
It's true.

08:54.840 --> 08:55.840
Third show.

08:55.840 --> 09:02.040
We're talking, this is not... This is not like that, Baltimore, you're the best city,

09:02.040 --> 09:03.040
yeah, fucking rock on.

09:03.040 --> 09:04.040
But we do love you, B-Town.

09:04.040 --> 09:08.480
Yeah, B-Town, what's up?

09:08.480 --> 09:10.360
But we were talking backstage, you're like, what's your best show ever?

09:10.360 --> 09:14.040
And I think it was... Was anybody at our Adventure Zone show here last year?

09:14.040 --> 09:17.320
Y'all were fucking great, and you're great now too.

09:17.320 --> 09:18.880
So anyway, here's a yahoo from Rose Farlow.

09:18.880 --> 09:19.880
Thank you, Rose.

09:19.880 --> 09:20.880
It's yahoo answers user.

09:20.880 --> 09:24.160
They're anonymous, but we'll call them...

09:24.160 --> 09:25.160
Oh.

09:25.160 --> 09:28.320
Not in our day to day.

09:28.320 --> 09:30.160
Like they've got a real life.

09:30.160 --> 09:33.720
We're going to call them Dravid.

09:33.720 --> 09:39.440
Asks, how can I get the poltergeists in my house to understand that they don't scare

09:39.440 --> 09:43.120
me and nothing they can do will drive me away?

09:43.120 --> 09:49.720
All right, Dravid.

09:49.720 --> 09:55.440
I moved into my house two months ago, and they've been at it nonstop.

09:55.440 --> 09:58.520
Nothing that some earplugs can't fix, even though they try to take them out sometimes

09:58.520 --> 10:01.180
while I sleep.

10:01.180 --> 10:04.400
And I can handle a few objects being chucked my way from time to time.

10:04.400 --> 10:06.560
Holy shit.

10:06.560 --> 10:10.880
The fact of the matter is that as a living being with a physical presence, I am stronger

10:10.880 --> 10:17.640
and more powerful than they are 100 fold.

10:17.640 --> 10:27.760
The house belongs to me, and they belong to me.

10:27.760 --> 10:31.820
There's a new sheriff in town, and they might as well just cross over because their reign

10:31.820 --> 10:35.440
of terror in this old house is over.

10:35.440 --> 10:37.600
So get out of here, old dead sheriff.

10:37.600 --> 10:40.160
Welcome back to this old house.

10:40.160 --> 10:45.520
I'm Bob Vila, and busting makes me feel good.

10:45.520 --> 10:49.500
How can I get them to cross over or at least realize their attempts to drive me out are

10:49.500 --> 10:53.920
futile and they might as well just shut up?

10:53.920 --> 10:56.900
First let me ask, can I get a little bit more monitor so I can hear my dear brother over

10:56.900 --> 11:02.120
these rambunctious people?

11:02.120 --> 11:04.880
Thank you.

11:04.880 --> 11:11.960
I wish these ghosts would just quit it because they're embarrassing themselves.

11:11.960 --> 11:13.640
Let's clear one thing up first.

11:13.640 --> 11:16.320
You don't own the ghosts.

11:16.320 --> 11:17.580
This is America.

11:17.580 --> 11:19.480
We don't own anybody.

11:19.480 --> 11:21.080
You don't own the ghosts.

11:21.080 --> 11:25.780
If you can't own a cloud, if you can't own a beautiful vape cloud that you just made,

11:25.780 --> 11:28.600
if you can't own a ghost, they're basically the same damn thing.

11:28.600 --> 11:30.640
If you love a ghost, set it free.

11:30.640 --> 11:31.640
Yeah.

11:31.640 --> 11:32.640
Well, hold on.

11:32.640 --> 11:33.640
Hold on.

11:33.640 --> 11:34.640
No, hold on.

11:34.640 --> 11:35.640
Wait.

11:35.640 --> 11:40.240
When the Ghostbusters busted ghosts and had them in their little containment units.

11:40.240 --> 11:41.240
Still didn't own them.

11:41.240 --> 11:42.240
Okay.

11:42.240 --> 11:43.240
A warden doesn't own the prisoners.

11:43.240 --> 11:45.800
Yeah, that's a fair point.

11:45.800 --> 11:48.800
My children.

11:48.800 --> 11:54.820
I will also say, I don't know, I guess I've never thought about it in terms of am I stronger

11:54.820 --> 11:57.160
than a ghost?

11:57.160 --> 11:59.760
This guy has.

11:59.760 --> 12:08.040
Because like, yeah, they're ephemeral, they are nothing, but in movies they always seem

12:08.040 --> 12:09.040
pretty scary.

12:09.040 --> 12:10.040
Right.

12:10.040 --> 12:13.800
Well, not in Ghost, but Ghost sets up a weird dynamic where it's like you can either move

12:13.800 --> 12:20.760
a fucking Pepsi can and then it's like, I can kick your ass, or you can summon demons

12:20.760 --> 12:23.400
that drag me to hell and I can't fight that.

12:23.400 --> 12:24.400
Right.

12:24.400 --> 12:25.400
Right.

12:25.400 --> 12:26.400
He levels up so fast.

12:26.400 --> 12:27.400
He levels up real quick.

12:27.400 --> 12:28.400
He evolves.

12:28.400 --> 12:31.240
He uses a moonstone on him and he gets much bigger.

12:31.240 --> 12:34.760
Any time Patrick Swayze is not on camera, he's doing quests, quests and quests and quests

12:34.760 --> 12:35.760
and quests.

12:35.760 --> 12:36.760
Killing Kobolds.

12:36.760 --> 12:37.760
Killing Kobolds.

12:37.760 --> 12:38.760
Kill the Kobolds.

12:38.760 --> 12:39.760
Get the new powers.

12:39.760 --> 12:40.760
Crush Rome Belt.

12:40.760 --> 12:41.760
Crush Rome Belt.

12:41.760 --> 12:42.760
Inhabit Whoopi.

12:42.760 --> 12:46.160
Inhabit Whoopi.

12:46.160 --> 12:51.400
I don't know how you, what I do enjoy about this person, what I respect, is it's not about

12:51.400 --> 12:53.680
how do I get rid of the ghosts.

12:53.680 --> 12:56.880
It's how do I show the ghosts that I'm the boss.

12:56.880 --> 12:58.160
How do I establish dominance?

12:58.160 --> 12:59.160
Right.

12:59.160 --> 13:00.160
How do I dominate my ghosts?

13:00.160 --> 13:01.720
How do I Caesar Malone this shit?

13:01.720 --> 13:02.720
Yeah.

13:02.720 --> 13:03.720
Ghost Whisperer.

13:03.720 --> 13:06.040
You gotta tap the ghost on the nose.

13:06.040 --> 13:07.040
Here's how fucked Earth is.

13:07.040 --> 13:08.520
I just said Ghost Whisperer as a joke.

13:08.520 --> 13:10.000
Nah, it's a fucking thing.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.840
Like it was a whole show.

13:11.840 --> 13:12.840
Which Jennifer Love Hewitt.

13:12.840 --> 13:15.960
I gotta feel bad for these ghosts too because you know they have their little like post-game

13:15.960 --> 13:22.240
debriefs in the attic and they're just like, Jeremy, I've tried everything.

13:22.240 --> 13:23.240
He's not scared.

13:23.240 --> 13:24.240
He's not scared.

13:24.240 --> 13:25.240
He's just not spooked at all.

13:25.240 --> 13:26.240
I threw a few things at him.

13:26.240 --> 13:27.240
Nothing.

13:27.240 --> 13:28.240
He just caught him.

13:28.240 --> 13:30.800
He caught an apple and he just ate it in one bite.

13:30.800 --> 13:33.480
What am I supposed to do with that, Jeremy?

13:33.480 --> 13:35.400
That would be an interesting twist on Sixth Sense.

13:35.400 --> 13:36.400
I see dead people.

13:36.400 --> 13:37.400
Yeah.

13:37.400 --> 13:38.400
Yeah.

13:38.400 --> 13:39.400
Fine.

13:39.400 --> 13:40.400
And I wish they'd quit it.

13:40.400 --> 13:41.400
I've got stuff to do today.

13:41.400 --> 13:42.400
I'm a little boy.

13:42.400 --> 13:45.160
How cool would it be if you were just hanging out with a little seven-year-old and every

13:45.160 --> 13:49.160
once in a while is like, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, fuck off, whatever.

13:49.160 --> 13:50.160
I get it.

13:50.160 --> 13:52.160
He just walked around shutting all the cabinets.

13:52.160 --> 13:54.920
He's fucking idiots every time.

13:54.920 --> 13:55.920
Hold on, Bruce.

13:55.920 --> 14:00.600
Misha, I can't with you today.

14:00.600 --> 14:01.600
Misha Barton was in that film.

14:01.600 --> 14:04.720
A lot of people forget that.

14:04.720 --> 14:07.560
She was the throw-up ghost.

14:07.560 --> 14:08.560
You know.

14:08.560 --> 14:09.560
She threw up.

14:09.560 --> 14:10.560
It was real scary.

14:10.560 --> 14:11.560
Check Iron Newbie.

14:11.560 --> 14:12.560
That's what she's in there as.

14:12.560 --> 14:13.560
I work in a library.

14:13.560 --> 14:15.760
A few weeks ago, my library- A what?

14:15.760 --> 14:16.920
It's a question, Griffin.

14:16.920 --> 14:19.720
I don't- Did he say library?

14:19.720 --> 14:20.720
Like 95.

14:20.720 --> 14:23.720
Can we get a poll from the audience if he said library?

14:23.720 --> 14:27.120
Fuck it.

14:27.120 --> 14:29.960
Now let's hear it if he didn't say library.

14:29.960 --> 14:34.520
It kind of actually sounds slick down the middle.

14:34.520 --> 14:37.240
That side of the house is like, that was library.

14:37.240 --> 14:38.920
I think it's a speaker issue then.

14:38.920 --> 14:40.800
We've got a speaker problem.

14:40.800 --> 14:42.720
Can we get the R's up in the monitor?

14:42.720 --> 14:45.360
The R novice.

14:45.360 --> 14:48.040
I work in a library.

14:48.040 --> 14:49.720
A few weeks- A bibliotech.

14:49.720 --> 14:54.080
A few weeks- That's my fucking favorite U2 song.

14:54.080 --> 15:00.640
A few weeks ago, my library was chicken winged and hot dogged throughout the building.

15:00.640 --> 15:01.640
Sure.

15:01.640 --> 15:02.640
We'll get there.

15:02.640 --> 15:03.640
We'll need to get there.

15:03.640 --> 15:07.120
Meaning some wasteful scoundrels left them- I do like the idea that we would bring up

15:07.120 --> 15:13.240
a topic and a question and not tell you, the audience, what we were talking about.

15:13.240 --> 15:14.800
This is just for us.

15:14.800 --> 15:20.440
Meaning, some wasteful scoundrels left them all over the library.

15:20.440 --> 15:22.760
Now you've got me fucking paranoid.

15:22.760 --> 15:30.040
On tables, on bookshelves, on dancer and prancer- No, just on tables, on bookshelves, even hanging

15:30.040 --> 15:36.360
from a hook above the travel books- How do you hang a fucking hot dog from a hook?

15:36.360 --> 15:38.120
Have you never fished?

15:38.120 --> 15:40.760
You just put it on there.

15:40.760 --> 15:47.800
Someone fishing for Darryl's.

15:47.800 --> 15:54.240
We aren't sure who did it, but the people we think did do it were adults.

15:54.240 --> 15:57.120
Not shenanigan-pulling teens doing some sort of senior prank.

15:57.120 --> 15:59.240
We do not know the motive.

15:59.240 --> 16:04.880
Was it a crime of opportunity or one of premeditation?

16:04.880 --> 16:05.880
How do we get revenge?

16:05.880 --> 16:07.800
That's from Snack Attacked in Boston.

16:07.800 --> 16:08.800
You hear Snack Attacked.

16:08.800 --> 16:16.120
I heard one noise come from stage right of somebody going, and I thought that was them,

16:16.120 --> 16:17.120
but then we got an ecstatic cheer.

16:17.120 --> 16:21.840
Apparently a similar situation happened to you, so we've got a crime warrant.

16:21.840 --> 16:27.320
In what universe could this be a crime of opportunity?

16:27.320 --> 16:28.600
Right.

16:28.600 --> 16:36.720
Well, I was just going to sit here and eat these wings and hot dogs, but you know what?

16:36.720 --> 16:39.080
There's a hook over there, and I'm going to see what I can do about it.

16:39.080 --> 16:41.880
I'm going to do a hot dog experiment.

16:41.880 --> 16:47.680
How fucking sneaky was this person that they put this food all over the library and nobody

16:47.680 --> 16:49.440
saw it?

16:49.440 --> 16:52.900
And nobody saw it.

16:52.900 --> 16:53.900
You did it.

16:53.900 --> 16:54.900
You're in my head.

16:54.900 --> 16:55.900
Yeah.

16:55.900 --> 16:58.280
Welcome to Terror Dome.

16:58.280 --> 17:03.960
I could be in my dorm room a mile and a half away from the library, and if somebody in

17:03.960 --> 17:09.480
the library was fastening a hot dog onto a hook in the library, I would make sure I saw

17:09.480 --> 17:10.480
it.

17:10.480 --> 17:15.000
I don't know how you see somebody like, come on, piercing the ween.

17:15.000 --> 17:18.400
I don't know how you don't notice that.

17:18.400 --> 17:22.720
Yeah, I do have to say, and thank you for coming, and I don't mean to come down on you

17:22.720 --> 17:31.120
so hard, but if a librarian's job isn't to keep people from hanging hot dogs all around

17:31.120 --> 17:37.740
the books, and chicken wings, and also, if I may be so bold, if a librarian's job isn't

17:37.740 --> 17:42.920
to keep people from bringing huge containers of hot dogs and chicken wings into where the

17:42.920 --> 17:48.720
books are kept, I do not know what it is you are being paid to do.

17:48.720 --> 17:54.520
That seems like job one, the first video they put into the machine is like, you may happen

17:54.520 --> 18:00.920
to see some of our guests try to hang hot dogs or chicken wings up around the books

18:00.920 --> 18:03.480
if you see this, please ask them to desist.

18:03.480 --> 18:09.280
If you see someone come in in a large trench coat with an interesting perfume, you might

18:09.280 --> 18:12.640
be a redneck.

18:12.640 --> 18:15.880
I've got a really, you asked about revenge, I've got a real good revenge, and that is

18:15.880 --> 18:21.920
you go around, you're gonna love this, it's so good, you're gonna go around and collect

18:21.920 --> 18:28.600
all the food and then sit down and eat all of the delicious buffalo wings and hot dogs

18:28.600 --> 18:33.560
that they've, buffalo wings are very good, I don't understand what the question is about

18:33.560 --> 18:34.560
this.

18:34.560 --> 18:37.400
These have been manhandled and hooked.

18:37.400 --> 18:38.400
They've been in hookin'.

18:38.400 --> 18:42.680
I'm not saying, okay, skip the hook one, but if it's just some buffalo wings, if you're

18:42.680 --> 18:46.280
just like somewhere and you happen upon some, if it's still warm.

18:46.280 --> 18:47.280
Wait, no, finish this.

18:47.280 --> 18:49.680
Yeah, no, no, no, no, we're going all the way home.

18:49.680 --> 18:56.920
If you happen upon some still warm football food, I think you go for it.

18:56.920 --> 18:57.920
Anywhere?

18:57.920 --> 18:59.200
Anywhere, Griffin?

18:59.200 --> 19:03.880
Not on a street, but on a shelf somewhere.

19:03.880 --> 19:07.400
So you're walking down a library, you see an interesting book.

19:07.400 --> 19:08.400
What was that?

19:08.400 --> 19:09.400
Library.

19:09.400 --> 19:12.800
You see an interesting, like a Jimmy Carter biography, you take it.

19:12.800 --> 19:15.360
That's your go-to interesting book?

19:15.360 --> 19:18.360
Yeah, he's a fascinating man.

19:18.360 --> 19:19.360
Okay.

19:19.360 --> 19:26.720
You move it, behind there, a still warm, lots of nachos with nacho cheese all over them,

19:26.720 --> 19:30.120
and you think, score!

19:30.120 --> 19:34.000
Still warm, football food, good to go.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.200
All right.

19:36.200 --> 19:39.280
Listen, thank you all so much for coming.

19:39.280 --> 19:41.800
We're stopping the podcast for a second.

19:41.800 --> 19:43.440
Oh, no.

19:43.440 --> 19:47.720
Griffin, can we take a quick pause from jokes?

19:47.720 --> 19:49.440
Let's excuse jokes from the stage.

19:49.440 --> 19:51.760
Jokes, go get some ginger ale.

19:51.760 --> 19:55.200
Go to the green room.

19:55.200 --> 19:56.200
We got fruit snacks.

19:56.200 --> 19:57.720
We got chocolate in there.

19:57.720 --> 19:58.720
No problem.

19:58.720 --> 20:00.800
Still warm football food.

20:00.800 --> 20:05.480
So jokes is gone, Griffin.

20:05.480 --> 20:08.480
How much of what you're saying is cafe man?

20:08.480 --> 20:09.480
How much of it is life?

20:09.480 --> 20:10.480
If it's warm.

20:10.480 --> 20:11.480
No, no.

20:11.480 --> 20:12.480
No, no, no.

20:12.480 --> 20:13.480
Jokes are gone.

20:13.480 --> 20:14.480
No, jokes out.

20:14.480 --> 20:15.480
I told you jokes.

20:15.480 --> 20:18.920
I love you, and I care about you, and I need to know.

20:18.920 --> 20:22.120
You have a broken stomach, and jokes is gone.

20:22.120 --> 20:23.120
Jokes left the room.

20:23.120 --> 20:27.040
If I was at a library and I saw some, a library is the perfect setting because I would think

20:27.040 --> 20:29.560
that the library was having some sort of event.

20:29.560 --> 20:34.840
Griffin, I need what you say for the next 30 seconds until jokes comes back to be in

20:34.840 --> 20:37.480
short sentences that I can introduce in court.

20:37.480 --> 20:43.120
I need you to just say in concrete language the extent to which you're willing to eat

20:43.120 --> 20:44.120
chicken wings.

20:44.120 --> 20:45.640
Can I tell you something?

20:45.640 --> 20:50.600
Your body is so broken, you shouldn't be eating fucking buffalo wings if Carly Jepsen brings

20:50.600 --> 20:54.000
them to you on a silver platter.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.920
You shouldn't be eating them, period.

20:55.920 --> 20:56.920
End of story.

20:56.920 --> 21:03.200
It honestly is one of the few times a human being could say, I shouldn't, and mean it.

21:03.200 --> 21:06.560
Even if Trous is like, let's be bad, you could still be like-

21:06.560 --> 21:12.120
I need to take a pause and try to program what Justin just said into my brain so I can

21:12.120 --> 21:21.400
try to lucid dream to that tonight.

21:21.400 --> 21:29.280
Okay, so listen, we do have quite a bit more podcasts, and I would like jokes to be here

21:29.280 --> 21:30.280
for it.

21:30.280 --> 21:31.280
Okay.

21:31.280 --> 21:33.180
So could you just tell me, please-

21:33.180 --> 21:36.560
If it was a trusted setting and the wings were warm, yes.

21:36.560 --> 21:37.560
Stop.

21:37.560 --> 21:38.560
Stop.

21:38.560 --> 21:45.680
I put an asterisk, I put an asterisk next to trusted setting, and I'm going down to

21:45.680 --> 21:49.560
the bottom of the page, and I found the asterisk, what is the text that I find next to it?

21:49.560 --> 21:51.040
If it's a place I've been before.

21:51.040 --> 21:53.040
You've been lots of places.

21:53.040 --> 21:54.680
DMV, a gas station.

21:54.680 --> 21:55.680
This stage.

21:55.680 --> 21:56.680
Not a gas station.

21:56.680 --> 21:57.680
This stage, yes.

21:57.680 --> 21:58.680
If there were just buffalo wings out here when we came out-

21:58.680 --> 22:02.400
That's when a giant box falls over on you and someone's caught you.

22:02.400 --> 22:03.400
Yeah.

22:03.400 --> 22:08.000
Maybe that's what this library was doing, is they had a fucking trail of buffalo wings

22:08.000 --> 22:14.680
leading from the jock frat or whatever to try to get them into-

22:14.680 --> 22:15.680
Are they on a plate?

22:15.680 --> 22:16.680
Griffin, are they on a plate?

22:16.680 --> 22:17.680
Are they on a plate?

22:17.680 --> 22:18.680
Yeah.

22:18.680 --> 22:19.680
I wouldn't eat one just sitting on a couch.

22:19.680 --> 22:20.680
Are they peeled?

22:20.680 --> 22:23.120
We spent 15 fucking minutes talking about whether or not I would eat-

22:23.120 --> 22:27.240
Then answer the question.

22:27.240 --> 22:30.520
Would you not take them to security, lost and found, and then claim them in 40 days

22:30.520 --> 22:32.800
if no one had picked them up?

22:32.800 --> 22:33.800
Wouldn't be warm anymore.

22:33.800 --> 22:34.800
How about a yahoo?

22:34.800 --> 22:40.800
All right, this one was-

22:40.800 --> 22:41.800
Come on back.

22:41.800 --> 22:42.800
Come on back, jokes.

22:42.800 --> 22:43.800
We missed you.

22:43.800 --> 22:45.480
This one was sent in by Basil Butterbaugh.

22:45.480 --> 22:46.480
Thank you, Basil.

22:46.480 --> 22:47.480
It's by...

22:47.480 --> 22:48.480
You here?

22:48.480 --> 22:49.480
All right.

22:49.480 --> 22:50.480
Oh, you went to college.

22:50.480 --> 22:51.480
Cool.

22:51.480 --> 22:52.480
Were they cool?

22:52.480 --> 22:55.760
I bet if you go to school with somebody named Basil Butterbaugh, you remember them.

22:55.760 --> 22:56.760
You would know them.

22:56.760 --> 23:03.000
It's from Yahoo Answers user, the website's doing a bad job.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.480
Yeah, it's not loading.

23:05.480 --> 23:07.920
This one's David also.

23:07.920 --> 23:12.840
David asks, I dream of bathrooms?

23:12.840 --> 23:16.920
I dream of a bathrooms like every other dream.

23:16.920 --> 23:17.920
Nothing happens in there.

23:17.920 --> 23:20.080
It's just me checking out different kinds of bathrooms.

23:20.080 --> 23:27.520
Big bathrooms, small bathrooms, hospital bathrooms, old rusty bathrooms, public bathrooms,

23:27.520 --> 23:32.920
bathrooms with fish swimming in the toilets, bathrooms with five toilets to a stall.

23:32.920 --> 23:33.920
Hold on.

23:33.920 --> 23:39.480
Why'd you react that way to fish swimming in the toilet, but not old rusty bathrooms?

23:39.480 --> 23:40.480
Old rusty bathrooms.

23:40.480 --> 23:41.480
Check.

23:41.480 --> 23:42.480
Oh, fish.

23:42.480 --> 23:43.480
Yeah.

23:43.480 --> 23:48.160
Well, think of the attendant who would have to refresh the fish every time.

23:48.160 --> 23:51.160
Every few hours, really?

23:51.160 --> 23:52.640
Bathrooms with five toilets to a stall.

23:52.640 --> 23:53.800
What's the deal with this?

23:53.800 --> 23:56.000
I have an obsession with dreaming about bathrooms.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.880
Every bathroom is unique, but nothing ever happens.

23:58.880 --> 24:10.880
I want to meet the person who has dreams every night, every night, where they enter a room,

24:10.880 --> 24:14.920
that's it, for hours?

24:14.920 --> 24:15.920
Yeah.

24:15.920 --> 24:23.720
They just spend hours going, hmm, all right.

24:23.720 --> 24:29.360
All of our great bathroom geniuses, all the great geniuses of bathroom design have had

24:29.360 --> 24:30.480
dreams like this.

24:30.480 --> 24:31.820
You have to imagine.

24:31.820 --> 24:33.900
This is how you get the calling, right?

24:33.900 --> 24:38.400
You see in your dreams, bathrooms you want to see in the world.

24:38.400 --> 24:40.880
And that's the universe's way of telling you.

24:40.880 --> 24:43.280
Be the bathroom you wish to see in the world.

24:43.280 --> 24:44.280
Exactly, Travis.

24:44.280 --> 24:45.280
Yes.

24:45.280 --> 24:46.280
Yes.

24:46.280 --> 24:47.280
You dream.

24:47.280 --> 24:48.280
If you don't dream.

24:48.280 --> 24:52.240
That's a Craigslist listing title, if I've ever heard one, by the way.

24:52.240 --> 24:55.000
So I don't think it's weird.

24:55.000 --> 25:01.000
I think you're being called, like you're being called to create the great bathrooms, some

25:01.000 --> 25:02.240
of the great bathrooms.

25:02.240 --> 25:07.560
Oh, I like that because like the five toilets in one stall is maybe it's like a conversation.

25:07.560 --> 25:08.560
Sure.

25:08.560 --> 25:09.560
Who knows?

25:09.560 --> 25:10.560
Yeah.

25:10.560 --> 25:11.560
It's a conversation shit pit.

25:11.560 --> 25:12.560
Yeah.

25:12.560 --> 25:15.200
I can't see inside the head of a bathroom genius.

25:15.200 --> 25:19.160
I just take his work as it comes and enjoy it in my own way.

25:19.160 --> 25:24.720
When Tesla brought the world's first toilet to the Chicago World's Fair and electrified

25:24.720 --> 25:25.720
it.

25:25.720 --> 25:26.720
Electrified it.

25:26.720 --> 25:30.360
He was probably having toilet dreams every night.

25:30.360 --> 25:34.880
You know, you're joking, I think, but it's hard to tell with you sometimes.

25:34.880 --> 25:36.560
It's hard to tell with you sometimes.

25:36.560 --> 25:40.680
But I am now thinking about, it must have been really hard for the first person that

25:40.680 --> 25:46.960
invented a toilet to convince people like, no, go ahead, it's fine.

25:46.960 --> 25:50.280
What about my big old nasty cloth bag?

25:50.280 --> 25:51.280
What do I do with that?

25:51.280 --> 25:52.280
No, you throw that out.

25:52.280 --> 25:53.280
You're done with that now.

25:53.280 --> 25:54.280
You throw that out.

25:54.280 --> 25:55.280
No, it's a hole.

25:55.280 --> 25:57.040
So wait, it's a hole in your house.

25:57.040 --> 25:58.040
In the house.

25:58.040 --> 26:00.320
That I'll just go shit in?

26:00.320 --> 26:01.320
I'm sorry.

26:01.320 --> 26:02.320
I'm sorry.

26:02.320 --> 26:03.440
Hey, I don't mean to seem dense.

26:03.440 --> 26:04.440
I shit outside.

26:04.440 --> 26:05.440
Right.

26:05.440 --> 26:10.680
So, but no, I want you to come in my house and poop in a room in there.

26:10.680 --> 26:13.080
A room like a bedroom or a parlor.

26:13.080 --> 26:14.080
Right.

26:14.080 --> 26:15.080
It's a special one.

26:15.080 --> 26:20.300
Nobody goes in, but I have a chair that makes it disappear.

26:20.300 --> 26:22.000
That doesn't make any sense at all.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
How about I just shit outside?

26:24.000 --> 26:25.080
What about outside?

26:25.080 --> 26:28.640
There's all kinds of outside and you've only got the one house.

26:28.640 --> 26:31.440
I don't need to shit in your house.

26:31.440 --> 26:32.440
I'm fine out there.

26:32.440 --> 26:33.560
Really, it's not a big deal.

26:33.560 --> 26:35.700
We've been doing it for generations.

26:35.700 --> 26:41.800
How many people at fucking Tesla's Toilet Palooza, Chicago World's Fair, 1930, whenever,

26:41.800 --> 26:46.600
rolled up and were like, okay, this seems good, seems good, let me get a feel for it.

26:46.600 --> 26:47.600
All right.

26:47.600 --> 26:51.040
Let me just take this big tank top off and here we go.

26:51.040 --> 26:52.040
Boom.

26:52.040 --> 26:53.600
And then you hide it, right?

26:53.600 --> 26:55.200
Tesla, it didn't go away.

26:55.200 --> 26:56.880
Yeah, I know.

26:56.880 --> 26:58.760
You did such a bad job.

26:58.760 --> 26:59.760
That is true.

26:59.760 --> 27:04.400
How many people do you think bought toilets, like took a shit in them and then threw it

27:04.400 --> 27:07.240
away and went and bought a new one?

27:07.240 --> 27:10.600
This is an expensive habit.

27:10.600 --> 27:13.840
We're trying to figure out the number to call for the dirty cloth bag guy.

27:13.840 --> 27:14.840
Yeah, I'm done.

27:14.840 --> 27:15.840
I'm done.

27:15.840 --> 27:16.840
I finished.

27:16.840 --> 27:17.840
Come get it.

27:17.840 --> 27:21.480
Yeah, no, I'm going to need a new dirty cloth bag to put it in, but it's in the chair for

27:21.480 --> 27:22.480
sure.

27:22.480 --> 27:23.480
What's that?

27:23.480 --> 27:24.480
Connect it to water?

27:24.480 --> 27:25.480
I don't.

27:25.480 --> 27:26.480
Hmm.

27:26.480 --> 27:27.480
Hmm.

27:27.480 --> 27:28.480
How about I get out here, Griffin?

27:28.480 --> 27:29.480
We just did one.

27:29.480 --> 27:30.480
How about a regular question?

27:30.480 --> 27:31.480
Griffin?

27:31.480 --> 27:32.480
Yes.

27:32.480 --> 27:33.480
I work in a library.

27:33.480 --> 27:34.480
Nope.

27:34.480 --> 27:35.480
No, you know what?

27:35.480 --> 27:36.480
Let's take a second round of that one.

27:36.480 --> 27:37.480
I feel like you could have done a better job.

27:37.480 --> 27:38.480
Let's do that.

27:38.480 --> 27:39.480
One more again.

27:39.480 --> 27:40.480
One more again.

27:40.480 --> 27:41.480
Okay.

27:41.480 --> 27:46.400
When I was... I've always wondered what it's like for someone to demand I play the hits,

27:46.400 --> 27:56.900
and now... When I was younger, my mom rented a horse for my B-day party because I enjoyed

27:56.900 --> 27:58.440
my little pony at the time.

27:58.440 --> 27:59.580
You don't need an excuse.

27:59.580 --> 28:01.160
It's cool.

28:01.160 --> 28:02.160
They're very good animals.

28:02.160 --> 28:03.160
They're good animals.

28:03.160 --> 28:04.160
My friends-

28:04.160 --> 28:05.160
And it's a childhood birthday party.

28:05.160 --> 28:06.160
There's a pony there.

28:06.160 --> 28:07.160
It's a success.

28:07.160 --> 28:08.160
Yeah.

28:08.160 --> 28:09.160
No one's going to be like, how gauche?

28:09.160 --> 28:10.640
I love my little pony.

28:10.640 --> 28:14.800
What is this doing here?

28:14.800 --> 28:28.320
My friends think it's hysterical because I hate horses and joke about getting... Fine.

28:28.320 --> 28:32.280
They joke about getting one for my B-day later this month.

28:32.280 --> 28:35.200
I'm terrified they might actually go through with it.

28:35.200 --> 28:36.600
Oh, come on.

28:36.600 --> 28:38.880
How do I let them know I'm not joking about...

28:38.880 --> 28:44.960
Not wanting another horse near me without instigating them, and that's Jade from Boston.

28:44.960 --> 28:45.960
Jade.

28:45.960 --> 28:48.000
Please don't boo Jade.

28:48.000 --> 28:49.820
There's a million of you.

28:49.820 --> 28:50.820
But are you here?

28:50.820 --> 28:51.820
Okay.

28:51.820 --> 28:52.820
Okay.

28:52.820 --> 28:53.820
All right.

28:53.820 --> 28:54.820
You know what?

28:54.820 --> 28:55.820
Turn around.

28:55.820 --> 28:56.820
Everyone leave Jade the fuck alone.

28:56.820 --> 28:57.820
No.

28:57.820 --> 28:58.820
We're not going to do this.

28:58.820 --> 28:59.820
Jade.

28:59.820 --> 29:00.820
No.

29:00.820 --> 29:01.820
I can't.

29:01.820 --> 29:07.880
I got to disperse this because I don't want Jade to feel like this isn't a welcome place.

29:07.880 --> 29:11.280
Like, too bad.

29:11.280 --> 29:14.960
It's the most beautiful animal and it's at your birthday party.

29:14.960 --> 29:18.920
Let me play the world's smallest... Is it violin?

29:18.920 --> 29:22.160
The world's smallest violin for you.

29:22.160 --> 29:25.920
Do it.

29:25.920 --> 29:27.400
That's not what a violin sounds like at all.

29:27.400 --> 29:29.840
I'm just realizing people don't normally make the noise.

29:29.840 --> 29:31.340
That's not usually part of the thing.

29:31.340 --> 29:32.880
People don't usually do that.

29:32.880 --> 29:38.200
Jade, if you weren't afraid of horses, this is a great con to get your friends to supply

29:38.200 --> 29:39.640
a horse for your birthday.

29:39.640 --> 29:40.640
Holy shit.

29:40.640 --> 29:43.880
This is the most reverse that psychology can get.

29:43.880 --> 29:44.880
Yeah.

29:44.880 --> 29:48.680
I'm just trying to put myself in the headspace of somebody who wouldn't be stoked to see

29:48.680 --> 29:50.240
a horse under any circumstance.

29:50.240 --> 29:52.560
Is it because they're big and they got them chompers?

29:52.560 --> 29:53.560
I get that.

29:53.560 --> 29:54.560
I get that.

29:54.560 --> 29:57.240
They are huge bite machines, essentially.

29:57.240 --> 29:58.240
Yeah.

29:58.240 --> 29:59.520
And fast, too.

29:59.520 --> 30:01.720
So they'll bring that bite right to you.

30:01.720 --> 30:03.000
Actually now I'm thinking about it.

30:03.000 --> 30:04.000
Horses are kind of scary.

30:04.000 --> 30:05.000
Yeah.

30:05.000 --> 30:06.000
You know what?

30:06.000 --> 30:07.000
And they kick.

30:07.000 --> 30:08.000
And they have metal on their feet.

30:08.000 --> 30:09.000
They kick.

30:09.000 --> 30:11.240
And often people with swords ride them.

30:11.240 --> 30:13.760
So that's another thing to worry about.

30:13.760 --> 30:14.760
Shit, guys.

30:14.760 --> 30:19.840
Have you ever seen a horse running directly at you and thought, awesome.

30:19.840 --> 30:24.680
I'm going to stand perfectly still and receive that creature.

30:24.680 --> 30:25.680
Maybe- Shit, guys.

30:25.680 --> 30:27.680
Have we been wrong this whole time?

30:27.680 --> 30:28.680
Wait.

30:28.680 --> 30:29.680
Hold on.

30:29.680 --> 30:30.680
Wait.

30:30.680 --> 30:32.760
So the horse says something to you and yeah, you hate all of them.

30:32.760 --> 30:37.520
Like you're at a rodeo and the horse is just like, fuck you, Jade.

30:37.520 --> 30:42.720
And then, but it said it really quiet so like your parents didn't hear and they wouldn't

30:42.720 --> 30:44.280
believe you.

30:44.280 --> 30:54.400
Horse, did you tell my daughter Jade to fuck off?

30:54.400 --> 30:55.400
Straight from the horse's mouth.

30:55.400 --> 30:59.840
And you turn around.

30:59.840 --> 31:00.840
See Jade?

31:00.840 --> 31:01.840
Anyway, I'm going to go get the car.

31:01.840 --> 31:03.600
I'm going to eat your dog.

31:03.600 --> 31:04.600
Did you hear it?

31:04.600 --> 31:10.320
It just said it's going to eat our- You heard it, right?

31:10.320 --> 31:12.520
Maybe call your friends below.

31:12.520 --> 31:15.600
If they're like, or I'm going to get your horse and be like, you know what, fine.

31:15.600 --> 31:16.600
Do it.

31:16.600 --> 31:17.600
Yeah.

31:17.600 --> 31:22.200
Jade, I don't know your friends, but if they're like everybody on earth, they're not going

31:22.200 --> 31:24.640
to fucking follow through with this.

31:24.640 --> 31:27.920
You have no worry of this actually coming to fruition.

31:27.920 --> 31:30.240
I could talk, I could run a lot of shit.

31:30.240 --> 31:32.520
I could talk a lot of shit about getting a horse.

31:32.520 --> 31:34.080
I would have no clue.

31:34.080 --> 31:35.080
What do you do?

31:35.080 --> 31:36.440
Do you call a farm?

31:36.440 --> 31:37.440
Do you know why?

31:37.440 --> 31:40.920
I'll tell you exactly the point at which this joke falls apart.

31:40.920 --> 31:42.560
When money has to change hands.

31:42.560 --> 31:43.560
Yeah, exactly.

31:43.560 --> 31:44.560
It stops being funny.

31:44.560 --> 31:45.560
Oh, you know what would be funny?

31:45.560 --> 31:46.560
We'll rent a horse for Jade.

31:46.560 --> 31:47.560
It's how much?

31:47.560 --> 31:48.560
How?

31:48.560 --> 31:50.760
And I have to get it from here to there?

31:50.760 --> 31:51.760
No way.

31:51.760 --> 31:52.760
Can't do it.

31:52.760 --> 31:56.620
Well, the horse has a way for you to get it from somewhere to somewhere else.

31:56.620 --> 31:58.080
To put miles on it?

31:58.080 --> 32:01.040
Yeah, you're not going to put miles on my horse.

32:01.040 --> 32:02.880
This is a strictly scaring horse.

32:02.880 --> 32:04.080
It's just for scaring people.

32:04.080 --> 32:05.080
What's that?

32:05.080 --> 32:06.080
You want to scare your friend, Jade?

32:06.080 --> 32:07.080
Yeah, we can do that.

32:07.080 --> 32:12.400
That's 250 as our regular scare your friend rate, but sounds like she's had some experience

32:12.400 --> 32:15.840
with horses before, so we could do it for two.

32:15.840 --> 32:16.840
How about Yahoo?

32:16.840 --> 32:17.840
Hit me.

32:17.840 --> 32:18.840
This one was sent in by...

32:18.840 --> 32:25.680
I appreciate y'all cheer every time for this bad website.

32:25.680 --> 32:27.040
It was sent in by Catherine Parkinson.

32:27.040 --> 32:28.040
Thank you, Catherine.

32:28.040 --> 32:29.500
It's Yahoo Answers.

32:29.500 --> 32:30.500
Also anonymous.

32:30.500 --> 32:31.500
Fuck.

32:31.500 --> 32:35.560
Dravid has been busy.

32:35.560 --> 32:45.120
Dravid asks, what do you call the middle part of the pizza?

32:45.120 --> 32:49.440
Urgent.

32:49.440 --> 32:57.520
So, we've got that good, good crust, but what is the part that is not on the edge of the

32:57.520 --> 32:58.520
pizza?

32:58.520 --> 33:01.000
It's just pizza.

33:01.000 --> 33:10.680
No, because if you cut the crust away from something, it's almost like we require a word

33:10.680 --> 33:11.680
for...

33:11.680 --> 33:16.840
No, if you cut the crust away from the pizza, you have a crust and you have a pizza.

33:16.840 --> 33:17.840
You still have a pizza.

33:17.840 --> 33:20.640
Hold on, Justin, because you can't say you have to cut the crust off of the pizza.

33:20.640 --> 33:23.040
That means crust is part of the pizza.

33:23.040 --> 33:31.840
Yeah, but if I walk in and look at a plate and it's pizza with no crust on it, I'm not

33:31.840 --> 33:34.440
going to be like, what the fuck is that?

33:34.440 --> 33:38.040
What did you make?

33:38.040 --> 33:40.960
Okay, wait, hold on.

33:40.960 --> 33:45.040
By the way, Crisp and Tasty's do not have crusts, so if you got a Crisp and Tasty pizza

33:45.040 --> 33:52.280
from Gino's, which is a Gino's family of products, if you got a Crisp and Tasty, that is not going

33:52.280 --> 33:53.280
to have a crust.

33:53.280 --> 33:54.280
How do you fucking pick it up?

33:54.280 --> 33:55.280
That's the thing.

33:55.280 --> 33:58.040
You're wrong, because it's all crust.

33:58.040 --> 34:01.560
No, this person is talking about specifically the crust around the edge.

34:01.560 --> 34:05.000
It's not about the bottom crust, but that the bottom is crust.

34:05.000 --> 34:06.080
It layers up.

34:06.080 --> 34:08.040
It doesn't layer from the outside in.

34:08.040 --> 34:09.840
It layers from the bottom up.

34:09.840 --> 34:15.560
It's not... Travis is saying there's not a bread hoop containing a cheese mess.

34:15.560 --> 34:20.480
That's what I... Okay, but if I finish a slice of pizza except for the crust, I would

34:20.480 --> 34:23.560
be like, here, I saved you the crust.

34:23.560 --> 34:28.260
I'm not expecting the person to scrape the toppings off and hand me a triangular bread

34:28.260 --> 34:29.260
slice.

34:29.260 --> 34:30.260
Holy shit.

34:30.260 --> 34:31.260
I mean, listen, you're right.

34:31.260 --> 34:32.260
Yeah, I know.

34:32.260 --> 34:33.520
But I also feel that I am right.

34:33.520 --> 34:34.520
I get it though.

34:34.520 --> 34:35.520
You are.

34:35.520 --> 34:36.520
Yeah.

34:36.520 --> 34:38.560
The problem is we've got a language issue here.

34:38.560 --> 34:39.560
It's a language issue.

34:39.560 --> 34:43.800
It has to be solved by introducing another word to the lexicon, to the fucking anatomy

34:43.800 --> 34:45.400
of Zah.

34:45.400 --> 34:46.400
Okay.

34:46.400 --> 34:52.000
The bread hoop that we think of as crust, or I'm speaking of as crust, pizza bones.

34:52.000 --> 34:55.920
So... Yes, I think we can all agree on that.

34:55.920 --> 34:57.360
We can all agree on pizza bones.

34:57.360 --> 34:59.200
You have cheese-stuffed bones.

34:59.200 --> 35:02.960
So this is the tissue of the- So the cheese is the marrow.

35:02.960 --> 35:03.960
Right.

35:03.960 --> 35:05.520
The cheese is the marrow of the bones.

35:05.520 --> 35:06.800
Okay, okay, okay.

35:06.800 --> 35:07.800
This is horrible.

35:07.800 --> 35:11.440
You get rid of the pizza bones.

35:11.440 --> 35:13.000
Yes.

35:13.000 --> 35:15.400
Underneath that is still crust.

35:15.400 --> 35:16.400
So I grant you that.

35:16.400 --> 35:17.400
Muscle.

35:17.400 --> 35:18.400
No, what are we doing here?

35:18.400 --> 35:19.400
Cheese is skin.

35:19.400 --> 35:20.400
Sauce is blood.

35:20.400 --> 35:21.400
Yeah, sauce is the blood.

35:21.400 --> 35:22.400
Pepperonis are freckles.

35:22.400 --> 35:23.400
Oh my God.

35:23.400 --> 35:24.400
It's not some skin.

35:24.400 --> 35:25.400
Read the question again.

35:25.400 --> 35:26.400
Start back at the beginning.

35:26.400 --> 35:27.400
Okay.

35:27.400 --> 35:28.400
It's one sentence.

35:28.400 --> 35:29.400
Yeah, one more time.

35:29.400 --> 35:34.840
One more time, one more time, one more time, one more time.

35:34.840 --> 35:37.840
We've got that good, good crust, but what is the part that is not on the edge of the

35:37.840 --> 35:38.840
pizza?

35:38.840 --> 35:39.840
And this is- Okay, wait.

35:39.840 --> 35:40.840
Time out.

35:40.840 --> 35:41.840
Oh, Jesus.

35:41.840 --> 35:42.840
You all fucking heard it that time, right?

35:42.840 --> 35:43.840
We just did the flashback.

35:43.840 --> 35:44.840
The edge of the pizza.

35:44.840 --> 35:45.840
That is what was being discussed.

35:45.840 --> 35:46.840
The pizza is the hole.

35:46.840 --> 35:51.280
But the edge of the pizza, this question specifically is talking about the part that is not the pizza

35:51.280 --> 35:52.280
bones.

35:52.280 --> 35:53.280
Right?

35:53.280 --> 35:54.660
Agreed?

35:54.660 --> 35:55.660
We can all agree on that.

35:55.660 --> 35:56.660
They said around the edge of the pizza.

35:56.660 --> 35:57.660
Justin.

35:57.660 --> 35:58.660
I'm not like some loon here.

35:58.660 --> 35:59.660
Justin.

35:59.660 --> 36:00.660
That's what I was thinking about is the bones.

36:00.660 --> 36:01.660
I'm right.

36:01.660 --> 36:02.660
Justin.

36:02.660 --> 36:03.660
Justin.

36:03.660 --> 36:04.660
Yeah.

36:04.660 --> 36:05.660
Okay.

36:05.660 --> 36:06.660
Play with me.

36:06.660 --> 36:08.160
Play with me.

36:08.160 --> 36:10.760
In this space, don't just say fuck this question.

36:10.760 --> 36:12.600
No, I'm not saying fuck the question.

36:12.600 --> 36:19.940
I'm saying fuck the condescension and the de-evolution into semantics.

36:19.940 --> 36:22.720
We just need to move on with what the part that isn't the bones.

36:22.720 --> 36:25.520
To be fair, this is a question about what you call something.

36:25.520 --> 36:27.080
So it is literally all semantics.

36:27.080 --> 36:28.080
Okay, granted.

36:28.080 --> 36:29.080
Okay.

36:29.080 --> 36:39.240
Would it be too confusing if we referred to the center, we need a fucking word for it.

36:39.240 --> 36:40.240
The core.

36:40.240 --> 36:41.240
The core.

36:41.240 --> 36:42.800
The core.

36:42.800 --> 36:46.040
The mantle.

36:46.040 --> 36:47.920
The mantle of the za.

36:47.920 --> 36:49.720
What about just the meat?

36:49.720 --> 36:50.720
The pearl.

36:50.720 --> 36:51.720
But the meat has...

36:51.720 --> 36:52.720
Oh, I like the pearl.

36:52.720 --> 36:57.240
The pearl is better because the meat, it does have meat.

36:57.240 --> 37:02.840
So a meat lover's pizza in this context would be pretty wild because if you did not in fact

37:02.840 --> 37:06.960
love the meat as Griffin describes it, that would be a weird person eating pizza.

37:06.960 --> 37:09.000
I don't think it's the best choice for you.

37:09.000 --> 37:10.000
Oh, okay.

37:10.000 --> 37:11.000
Let's throw it all out.

37:11.000 --> 37:12.000
All right.

37:12.000 --> 37:15.640
The outside hoop is the rind.

37:15.640 --> 37:17.280
Why do we have to throw out crust?

37:17.280 --> 37:18.280
Crust is crust.

37:18.280 --> 37:19.280
Dammit, you're right.

37:19.280 --> 37:20.280
Crust is crust is crust.

37:20.280 --> 37:21.280
No, we did this.

37:21.280 --> 37:22.280
It's the bones.

37:22.280 --> 37:23.280
No.

37:23.280 --> 37:24.280
Rind and flesh.

37:24.280 --> 37:25.280
Holy shit.

37:25.280 --> 37:26.280
Rind and flesh.

37:26.280 --> 37:28.480
Rind and then the flesh of the pizza.

37:28.480 --> 37:29.480
The flesh of the pizza.

37:29.480 --> 37:33.880
Y'all are cheering, so we'll move on, but this is not up for a vote, okay?

37:33.880 --> 37:36.720
We're gonna settle this together.

37:36.720 --> 37:38.320
I like rind and flesh.

37:38.320 --> 37:39.320
Rind and flesh.

37:39.320 --> 37:40.320
Griffin, can you get on board with that?

37:40.320 --> 37:44.800
Yes, absolutely, if it means we can do another question.

37:44.800 --> 37:48.400
Okay.

37:48.400 --> 37:54.320
I have yet another question that I am going to grab here for you all.

37:54.320 --> 38:00.880
I love my friend, but a few weeks ago, I was in Target with her, and she removed all her

38:00.880 --> 38:03.760
feet coverings.

38:03.760 --> 38:11.000
Is every fucking question in this episode gonna be completely spiritually challenging?

38:11.000 --> 38:22.120
Both her shoes and socks to try on a pair of socks that she had taken out of a package

38:22.120 --> 38:24.560
hanging on the wall.

38:24.560 --> 38:27.240
No, no, no.

38:27.240 --> 38:31.920
I guess they didn't fit, because you are acting like you're watching a sword swallower, and

38:31.920 --> 38:34.720
I'm loving it.

38:34.720 --> 38:49.380
I guess they didn't fit, because she put them in the garbage, back in the bag, and proceeded

38:49.380 --> 38:58.200
to walk barefoot through the sock aisles, looking for another pair to try.

38:58.200 --> 39:03.440
My question is, how do I forget I ever, ever saw this?

39:03.440 --> 39:05.440
Am I overreacting?

39:05.440 --> 39:07.760
No.

39:07.760 --> 39:10.120
Why did she do this to me?

39:10.120 --> 39:11.120
Help.

39:11.120 --> 39:17.080
From Mortified in a Major Way in Massachusetts, I almost don't want to know if you are here.

39:17.080 --> 39:18.080
Are you?

39:18.080 --> 39:19.080
Hey.

39:19.080 --> 39:20.080
No, no.

39:20.080 --> 39:21.320
No, listen.

39:21.320 --> 39:22.320
Is your friend?

39:22.320 --> 39:23.320
Did you bring them?

39:23.320 --> 39:25.960
Oh, thank God.

39:25.960 --> 39:27.960
It almost got real bad.

39:27.960 --> 39:28.960
We're safe, everybody.

39:28.960 --> 39:29.960
It's fine, everybody.

39:29.960 --> 39:30.960
Sit back down.

39:30.960 --> 39:34.180
We almost had to end the show and rip cord out of ball stud.

39:34.180 --> 39:37.640
We need an extraction.

39:37.640 --> 39:39.640
Okay, so.

39:39.640 --> 39:42.240
This is theft.

39:42.240 --> 39:46.000
These socks are dunzo.

39:46.000 --> 39:47.000
That's the thing.

39:47.000 --> 39:50.960
There are so, so very many troubling things in this question.

39:50.960 --> 39:56.840
The thing that troubles me the most, because there could be a situation in which this person

39:56.840 --> 40:03.240
just has never had a human interaction before to understand, like, this is not okay, until

40:03.240 --> 40:10.520
you get to the point where you open a sealed package to try it.

40:10.520 --> 40:16.040
Because that is exactly what the sealed package is attempting to prevent.

40:16.040 --> 40:21.760
In opening, when I buy, you've broken a promise.

40:21.760 --> 40:29.200
When I buy a sealed package, the promise is, here, nobody touched these, except for the

40:29.200 --> 40:30.760
people that are supposed to.

40:30.760 --> 40:31.760
You know what we mean.

40:31.760 --> 40:33.720
But they definitely didn't try them on after making them.

40:33.720 --> 40:35.400
No one tried them on.

40:35.400 --> 40:40.340
It's a promise, and in doing this thing, you've broken a vow.

40:40.340 --> 40:44.160
You've broken a sacred vow between me and Target.

40:44.160 --> 40:49.900
Is it possible that your friend is deeply spiritual, and just wanted to be barefoot

40:49.900 --> 40:58.240
in this Target, just to fucking feel the energy, feel God in this Target tonight, and just

40:58.240 --> 41:05.200
get some of that, just get some Target in between her toes, and just fucking reconnect

41:05.200 --> 41:07.280
with fucking Isaac Mizrahi.

41:07.280 --> 41:12.040
Just like really reconnect with that weird dog who's died, probably, right?

41:12.040 --> 41:14.040
Because we don't see him so much anymore.

41:14.040 --> 41:21.160
She wants to be deeply in tune with this lamp designed by Ryan Seacrest.

41:21.160 --> 41:25.760
Or hey, maybe your friend just had a cross-country flight, just needs to make some fists with

41:25.760 --> 41:26.760
their toes.

41:26.760 --> 41:27.760
No?

41:27.760 --> 41:28.760
Okay.

41:28.760 --> 41:29.760
Die hard?

41:29.760 --> 41:30.760
No one's seen it?

41:30.760 --> 41:34.480
Yeah, no, everybody saw it, but that doesn't mean you have to, just, hey, Harry Potter,

41:34.480 --> 41:36.480
you guys know that one, right?

41:36.480 --> 41:37.480
Okay.

41:37.480 --> 41:41.480
See, they don't have to applaud for it, just because you said a thing, people, now.

41:41.480 --> 41:45.840
Actually, I'm ready to turn a bit of a corner here, because the real monster in this question

41:45.840 --> 41:46.840
is you.

41:46.840 --> 41:47.840
Uh-oh.

41:47.840 --> 41:48.840
Oh.

41:48.840 --> 41:49.840
And here is why.

41:49.840 --> 41:50.840
What?

41:50.840 --> 41:53.920
You saw this happen every step of the way.

41:53.920 --> 41:55.960
My brother is right.

41:55.960 --> 41:58.960
He comes on very strong, but you should have interceded.

41:58.960 --> 42:08.480
When Travis says step, he means every grimy fucking bare skin slapping against tile step.

42:08.480 --> 42:11.840
You owe this target an apology.

42:11.840 --> 42:17.040
You had so many opportunities to just tackle your friend and remove them from the target,

42:17.040 --> 42:22.080
and apologize to literally every person you saw on the way out.

42:22.080 --> 42:29.320
Okay, that was, that was convenient.

42:29.320 --> 42:34.360
I don't control when it happens.

42:34.360 --> 42:38.840
Whoa, shit.

42:38.840 --> 42:39.840
There's a bridge.

42:39.840 --> 42:49.320
Can I go to the bathroom, if you just want to...

42:49.320 --> 43:10.720
I want to munch.

43:10.720 --> 43:18.040
I want to munch.

43:18.040 --> 43:24.200
I'm talking to Munch Squad, it's a podcast.

43:24.200 --> 43:28.000
It's actually, it's a show within a show that has become more popular than the show that

43:28.000 --> 43:29.480
surrounds it.

43:29.480 --> 43:32.760
Yeah, and normally Griffin helps with it.

43:32.760 --> 43:36.960
This isn't like sad libs, where it's kind of a solo-mish.

43:36.960 --> 43:40.400
Munch Squad is very collaborative, but we're going to go ahead and get started, and hopefully

43:40.400 --> 43:41.400
Griffin will listen.

43:41.400 --> 43:42.400
Just talk real slow.

43:42.400 --> 43:44.600
He is, this is not a joke, gang.

43:44.600 --> 43:48.680
He is peeing now at every live show he's done on this tour.

43:48.680 --> 43:51.120
He really needs to get it under control.

43:51.120 --> 43:55.040
Yeah, peeing once a day, can you believe it?

43:55.040 --> 44:00.960
So I'm now subscribed... Look at my peppy boy.

44:00.960 --> 44:05.800
Sorry, I mispronounced that, pee-pee boy.

44:05.800 --> 44:09.560
I'm fucking 30 years old, you can't talk to me like that on a stage.

44:09.560 --> 44:15.640
I'm now subscribed to QSR Magazine, that's Quick Service Restaurant Magazine, and this

44:15.640 --> 44:18.520
is... Wait, hold on, they call it Quick Service

44:18.520 --> 44:19.520
Restaurant?

44:19.520 --> 44:21.620
Like there's not already another- That doesn't sound good, that's not flattering.

44:21.620 --> 44:23.840
There's already another term, it's called fast food.

44:23.840 --> 44:26.160
Why would you call it Quick Service Restaurant?

44:26.160 --> 44:27.920
I mean, fast food is very limiting.

44:27.920 --> 44:33.960
If I go to Chipotle, I'm not eating fast food, I'm eating a quick service.

44:33.960 --> 44:34.960
You are.

44:34.960 --> 44:35.960
No.

44:35.960 --> 44:36.960
You are though eating fast food.

44:36.960 --> 44:37.960
No.

44:37.960 --> 44:38.960
Did you hear they got queso now?

44:38.960 --> 44:41.080
Well, but just a heads up.

44:41.080 --> 44:45.360
Okay, so here's the... I don't have one of these around me, but the headline was too

44:45.360 --> 44:47.640
good to pass up.

44:47.640 --> 44:51.080
Yogurt Land's ice cream has been a hit with fans.

44:51.080 --> 44:57.720
Hold on, wait, is this a press release or a news article?

44:57.720 --> 45:03.560
This is a press release on Quick Service Magazine, industry news breaking, Yogurt Land's ice

45:03.560 --> 45:06.440
cream has been a hit with fans.

45:06.440 --> 45:09.340
And this is under the category menu innovations.

45:09.340 --> 45:11.560
Menu innovations.

45:11.560 --> 45:16.400
Beginning August 30th, Yogurt Land is giving everyone sweet tooth a reason to rejoice with

45:16.400 --> 45:21.840
the limited time edition of premium chocolate and vanilla ice cream.

45:21.840 --> 45:24.440
Ooh la la.

45:24.440 --> 45:25.440
I know.

45:25.440 --> 45:26.440
This is very cosmopolitan.

45:26.440 --> 45:31.880
This is under menu innovations.

45:31.880 --> 45:37.200
The new serve yourself ice cream gives Yogurt Land fans an indulgent option to create their

45:37.200 --> 45:39.120
own customized treat.

45:39.120 --> 45:43.440
An indulgent option that before now has never existed.

45:43.440 --> 45:46.600
Where would one even get this iced cream?

45:46.600 --> 45:52.960
With the addition of chocolate and vanilla ice cream, Yogurt Land is providing a one

45:52.960 --> 45:55.440
stop shop for all to enjoy.

45:55.440 --> 46:00.720
Okay, if you've ever been with your friends and one of them's like, I want ice cream,

46:00.720 --> 46:04.000
and the other one's like, I'm going to Yogurt Land, and the first one's like, oh, fuck off,

46:04.000 --> 46:05.000
no way.

46:05.000 --> 46:11.680
I don't think this has happened, but anyway, Yogurt Land guests can swirl up their choice

46:11.680 --> 46:17.480
of, congratulations on finding the least appetizing wording for that, swirl up their choice of

46:17.480 --> 46:19.480
chocolate or vanilla ice cream.

46:19.480 --> 46:23.960
This is the third fucking time they've been like, oh no, just one flavor?

46:23.960 --> 46:27.480
No, fuck off, two flavors.

46:27.480 --> 46:32.680
One of these days the Yogurt Land people are going to find out about Neapolitan ice cream

46:32.680 --> 46:36.200
and they will instantly die.

46:36.200 --> 46:40.920
They can put toppings on it, build their own satisfying delicious masterpiece.

46:40.920 --> 46:43.280
Why are we talking about this?

46:43.280 --> 46:48.600
With over 60 toppings to choose from, like fruit, candy, cereal, nuts, cookies, and other

46:48.600 --> 46:49.600
toppings.

46:49.600 --> 46:52.240
Here's a quote from John Carlson.

46:52.240 --> 46:56.480
He's the senior vice president of marketing development and operations at Yogurt Land.

46:56.480 --> 47:01.160
He's the senior vice president of ice cream, he's just so happy to have something to do.

47:01.160 --> 47:05.800
The fucking president of ice cream was like, no, I don't want to put my name on this one.

47:05.800 --> 47:10.360
This is going to be a really stupid press release, I do not want to be involved.

47:10.360 --> 47:16.360
One of the many joys for Yogurt Land fans is to build their creation to perfectly suit

47:16.360 --> 47:20.000
their taste buds, says John Carlson.

47:20.000 --> 47:26.340
Now Froyo fanatics and ice cream lovers alike will have the chance to do so, all under one

47:26.340 --> 47:30.000
roof at Yogurt Land.

47:30.000 --> 47:37.020
Like how buck wild has Yogurt Land gotten that this return to the first two flavors

47:37.020 --> 47:43.240
on earth is this, it's like, all right, guys, we got to take out the old tire flavor.

47:43.240 --> 47:45.360
We've gone a little off the rails here.

47:45.360 --> 47:50.760
Listen, I prefer ice cream to yogurt, of course, but when have you ever been eating yogurt

47:50.760 --> 47:55.520
and just like sighed deeply and stared at it longingly and thought, I wish this was

47:55.520 --> 47:58.520
vanilla ice cream?

47:58.520 --> 48:05.680
The supposition here is that Yogurt Land has just now discovered that yes, ice cream does

48:05.680 --> 48:08.560
in fact taste better than yogurt.

48:08.560 --> 48:10.920
And also from the way they talk, it exists.

48:10.920 --> 48:11.920
Yeah, exactly.

48:11.920 --> 48:17.440
Like they had a meeting once and one of the people at the thing was like, we should sell

48:17.440 --> 48:19.240
ice cream, it tastes better, right?

48:19.240 --> 48:20.920
And people like it better?

48:20.920 --> 48:26.600
And they're already dumping fucking Cinnamon Toast Crunch and butter on it, so like, maybe

48:26.600 --> 48:27.600
it doesn't fucking-

48:27.600 --> 48:30.560
They've upended a gallon of sprees into it.

48:30.560 --> 48:34.360
It doesn't matter what the fucking canvas upon which they paint is.

48:34.360 --> 48:37.640
And literally all the machines we have work for both.

48:37.640 --> 48:38.640
They work for both.

48:38.640 --> 48:39.640
Let's-

48:39.640 --> 48:42.080
Shh, it's actually the same flavor, just different colors.

48:42.080 --> 48:44.480
They're gonna add a billion sprees to it, it don't matter.

48:44.480 --> 48:45.480
To matter.

48:45.480 --> 48:47.880
This is where it gets better.

48:47.880 --> 48:52.440
The majority of our guests are not exclusive to either frozen yogurt or ice cream.

48:52.440 --> 48:55.320
What are you talking about?

48:55.320 --> 48:58.200
It's kind of a dessert spectrum.

48:58.200 --> 49:03.120
So they're not exclusive to frozen yogurt or ice cream.

49:03.120 --> 49:05.120
Like, please, if you're this person-

49:05.120 --> 49:09.160
What is this fucking Dr. Seuss butterside upper world that you're trying to-

49:09.160 --> 49:11.200
Derek, what are you eating, Derek?

49:11.200 --> 49:12.200
I'm eating ice cream.

49:12.200 --> 49:13.200
Have you heard about yogurt?

49:13.200 --> 49:14.200
What?

49:14.200 --> 49:16.200
Yog- Did I say it right?

49:16.200 --> 49:17.200
Yog-yard?

49:17.200 --> 49:23.840
And the mom busts into a kid's bedroom, are you eating yogurt in this house?

49:23.840 --> 49:29.600
So giving them a choice ensures that they can come to us regardless of what they desire

49:29.600 --> 49:31.400
on a particular day.

49:31.400 --> 49:34.760
Have you- Okay, listen.

49:34.760 --> 49:38.280
Have you ever- You don't have ice cream?

49:38.280 --> 49:39.280
Ice cream?

49:39.280 --> 49:44.600
Have you ever had a craving for one of these foods that you could actually distinguish

49:44.600 --> 49:58.840
between- Stop, no, wait, I have to finish.

49:58.840 --> 50:04.400
Have you ever wanted soft serve ice cream but not frozen yogurt?

50:04.400 --> 50:07.160
Like, no, I definitely do.

50:07.160 --> 50:08.880
I have a sweet cold craving.

50:08.880 --> 50:10.440
I want it to be cold.

50:10.440 --> 50:11.440
Yeah.

50:11.440 --> 50:15.640
I do want it out of a machine where I pull a handle and it goes in the cup, but just

50:15.640 --> 50:19.800
not a yogurty kind of vibe.

50:19.800 --> 50:22.320
It's the cultures that really bother me.

50:22.320 --> 50:28.120
Do you mean like the deep ice cream culture and the deep yogurt cold?

50:28.120 --> 50:29.120
People get really into it.

50:29.120 --> 50:34.080
If I hear more fucking quotes from this dude saying like, there are people on earth who

50:34.080 --> 50:38.960
like ice cream and some days like yogurt, I'm gonna fucking jump off this stage.

50:38.960 --> 50:44.520
We wanted to give him as much choice as possible, so we definitely gave him chocolate or vanilla.

50:44.520 --> 50:49.520
At Yogurtland, we offer the guests an opportunity to find their own personal flavor.

50:49.520 --> 50:54.520
Our restaurant provides- As long as it's one of the two.

50:54.520 --> 50:57.560
This is what he says, and he really loses the plot here.

50:57.560 --> 51:01.240
Our restaurants provide a staircase of choices.

51:01.240 --> 51:02.720
What?

51:02.720 --> 51:10.080
That staircase just to simulate.

51:10.080 --> 51:13.960
Just a two-step staircase is what my brother has demonstrated.

51:13.960 --> 51:20.600
It's a staircase of choices, including non-fat and low-fat frozen yogurt, sorbets, and gelatos.

51:20.600 --> 51:24.240
So wait, time the fuck out.

51:24.240 --> 51:30.640
You have already introduced frozen yogurt, sorbet, and gelato, and the introduction

51:30.640 --> 51:34.640
of ice cream is a headline?

51:34.640 --> 51:38.760
Not only that, but has any human being ever looked at something and gone, wow, this is

51:38.760 --> 51:42.960
like a staircase of choices?

51:42.960 --> 51:46.320
His programming has broken down at this point.

51:46.320 --> 51:52.560
JonBot3000 has gone off the rails.

51:52.560 --> 51:59.320
Ice cream was the missing piece that now delivers a complete selection of frozen delights for

51:59.320 --> 52:04.800
guests to pair with our extensive topping bar to create their own unique flavor.

52:04.800 --> 52:08.120
And with this, the prophecy is complete.

52:08.120 --> 52:11.400
And now, and now, and now I die.

52:11.400 --> 52:17.820
No, wait, dude, Dippin' Dots, oh shit, okay, check it out.

52:17.820 --> 52:20.680
It's hard as fuck and in little, little pellets.

52:20.680 --> 52:21.680
It tastes like nothing.

52:21.680 --> 52:23.680
Guys, we found a new firmness.

52:23.680 --> 52:26.160
It's Dippin' Dots, it's hard as fuck.

52:26.160 --> 52:28.360
You walk into a yogurt land, it's like, what's your firmness level?

52:28.360 --> 52:30.800
It's like, nah, I'm feeling like a medium firm.

52:30.800 --> 52:31.800
All right.

52:31.800 --> 52:32.800
Two flavors of ice cream.

52:32.800 --> 52:37.920
I like to imagine the person that wrote this story just sat at Jon Carlson as he finished

52:37.920 --> 52:43.480
these paragraphs and just kept staring at him so Jon Carlson felt like, well, I should

52:43.480 --> 52:45.600
say something else.

52:45.600 --> 52:46.800
And this is what he said next.

52:46.800 --> 52:53.200
In a traditional ice cream shop, guests must commit to a whole scoop of one flavor at a

52:53.200 --> 52:55.360
single price.

52:55.360 --> 52:58.320
I just don't know if I'm ready for that kind of commitment.

52:58.320 --> 53:00.920
At Yogurt Land, the experience is different.

53:00.920 --> 53:05.920
We encourage our guests to sample our flavors and then choose how much of each they desire

53:05.920 --> 53:10.920
and blend with their choice of toppings to create their own personal flavor.

53:10.920 --> 53:16.440
The ability to create a unique experience with each visit makes us as special as the

53:16.440 --> 53:19.720
flavors we offer.

53:19.720 --> 53:20.720
What should I do next?

53:20.720 --> 53:22.720
I'm so excited.

53:22.720 --> 53:28.760
And then he closes with, at Yogurt Land, you are always in control.

53:28.760 --> 53:29.760
Shit.

53:29.760 --> 53:33.080
Now, all credit to Jon Carlson.

53:33.080 --> 53:35.040
It's 2017.

53:35.040 --> 53:37.240
I do understand the appeal, Jon.

53:37.240 --> 53:43.480
Thank you for having one thing in my fucking life on earth that is in fact under my control.

53:43.480 --> 53:48.480
I do appreciate that.

53:48.480 --> 53:52.040
That was the best person I've ever heard write words down.

53:52.040 --> 53:56.400
Because that's the kind of person that a boss sees that stuff and goes, well, at least

53:56.400 --> 53:57.400
he's bought in.

53:57.400 --> 53:58.400
I mean.

53:58.400 --> 54:04.280
No, that was the person who somebody walked up to them and was like, I need a 50,000 word

54:04.280 --> 54:08.960
press release about the fact that we sell two flavors of ice cream now.

54:08.960 --> 54:13.200
And he was like, shut up and watch me go.

54:13.200 --> 54:22.480
Well, assuming you might ask me for that, I've actually already written something up.

54:22.480 --> 54:29.600
Hey, everybody.

54:29.600 --> 54:31.720
This is Griffin McElroy from My Brother, My Brother and Me.

54:31.720 --> 54:33.240
Thanks for listening to the episode.

54:33.240 --> 54:35.560
Sorry that we did two live shows in a row.

54:35.560 --> 54:39.600
We usually try to space those out a little bit more on this feed, but this weekend kind

54:39.600 --> 54:42.080
of got away from us and we have a bunch of these in the tank now.

54:42.080 --> 54:43.760
So we thought we'd put up another one.

54:43.760 --> 54:48.200
This was our first, our early Boston show, I guess.

54:48.200 --> 54:49.200
It turned out pretty good, I thought.

54:49.200 --> 54:53.160
The late Boston show was buck wild and we'll probably be putting that one up and the Brooklyn

54:53.160 --> 54:57.840
show up eventually, but again, we're going to try and space those out a little bit more.

54:57.840 --> 54:59.840
I got some ads I want to tell you about, though.

54:59.840 --> 55:02.040
First one is for Squarespace.

55:02.040 --> 55:04.800
With Squarespace, you're going to use that platform and you're going to create yourself

55:04.800 --> 55:09.320

55:34.240 --> 55:37.620
and projects and thank you very much, but you can also see what a website made by Squarespace

55:37.620 --> 55:38.620
looks like.

55:38.620 --> 55:40.200
It's really easy to put that one together.

55:40.200 --> 55:43.320
Check out Squarespace.com for a free trial and when you're ready to launch, use the offer

One more time, that's the offer code MYBROTHER, all one word, save 10% off your first purchase

55:51.720 --> 55:52.720

55:52.720 --> 55:55.320
I also want to tell you about Stamps.com.

55:55.320 --> 55:57.480
These days, you can practically get everything on demand.

55:57.480 --> 56:00.320
Why are you still going to the post office and dealing with their limited hours?

56:00.320 --> 56:02.920
You can get postage on demand with Stamps.com.

56:02.920 --> 56:06.960
Anything you can do at the post office right now, you can do from your desk with Stamps.com.

56:06.960 --> 56:10.520
You can buy and print official US postage for any letter or package just using your

56:10.520 --> 56:11.720
own computer and printer.

56:11.720 --> 56:16.620
Unlike the post office, Stamps.com never closes because it's a fucking website.

56:16.620 --> 56:20.060
You can get whatever you need, whenever you need it, 24-7.

56:20.060 --> 56:24.200

You just go to Stamps.com.

56:29.240 --> 56:32.040
Before you do anything else, you want to click on the radio microphone at the top of the

56:32.040 --> 56:33.600
home page and type in MYBROTHER.

56:33.600 --> 56:34.600
That's Stamps.com.

Enter MYBROTHER.

56:43.280 --> 56:44.280
Never go to the post office again.

56:44.280 --> 56:46.080
Got a couple jumbotrons here.

56:46.080 --> 56:49.640
This one is for Caitlin Peterson, and it's from Ben Peterson, who says,

56:49.640 --> 56:51.400
Well, my love, we've done it.

56:51.400 --> 56:53.640
We've survived our first two years of marriage.

56:53.640 --> 56:57.080
And what better way to celebrate than with this definitely on-time message from Juice

56:57.080 --> 56:58.280
Scraps and Ditto.

56:58.280 --> 56:59.280
Or just Ditto.

56:59.280 --> 57:03.320
I can do my impression of the other two, but it will not be flattering.

57:03.320 --> 57:07.660
Thank you for cooking delicious food, knitting me kick-ass hats, and tolerating my near-daily

57:07.660 --> 57:09.040
banjo playing.

57:09.040 --> 57:12.440
You're the best nerd wife a bearded doofus could ask for.

57:12.440 --> 57:14.960
They wanted this on September 19th, which is tomorrow.

57:14.960 --> 57:17.640
So get off my jock, Ben.

57:17.640 --> 57:18.640
I'm just kidding.

57:18.640 --> 57:19.640
You had every reason to be on my jock.

57:19.640 --> 57:21.320
I can't believe we got this one out on time.

57:21.320 --> 57:23.920
Congratulations on your tremendous love.

57:23.920 --> 57:24.980
I got another message here.

57:24.980 --> 57:29.200
This one is for Will and Allison, and it's from Cooper, who says,

57:29.200 --> 57:32.500
Congrats on your engagement and your pending-slash-upcoming nuptials.

57:32.500 --> 57:35.420
Thank you for turning me on to the McElroy family of products, which have subsequently

57:35.420 --> 57:36.640
saved my life.

57:36.640 --> 57:41.520
You are both independently my favorite people, and with your powers combined, you will surely

57:41.520 --> 57:43.680
sit astride the world.

57:43.680 --> 57:46.760
Or at the very least be my favorite combined person.

57:46.760 --> 57:47.760
Love you, idiots.

57:47.760 --> 57:50.760
Why'd you have to get me in there at the end?

57:50.760 --> 57:55.200
Maybe it's an affectionate nickname, but it hurt me to read it.

57:55.200 --> 57:58.100
But congrats on your engagement, Will and Allison.

57:58.100 --> 58:00.520
Thank you to everybody for tweeting about my bim bam.

58:00.520 --> 58:01.520
Use the hashtag my bim bam.

58:01.520 --> 58:02.640
This is more of the zone cast thing.

58:02.640 --> 58:05.600
I don't know why I'm saying it here, but we sure do appreciate you spreading the word

58:05.600 --> 58:06.600
about the show.

58:06.600 --> 58:09.700
We appreciate everybody who came out to all these live shows last weekend.

58:09.700 --> 58:11.400
It was a whole lot of fun.

58:11.400 --> 58:14.360
We're looking forward to getting down south, Nashville and Atlanta.

58:14.360 --> 58:15.720
I think there's still some tickets available.

58:15.720 --> 58:19.520
If you go to mcroyshows.com slash tours, it may be sold out.

58:19.520 --> 58:20.520
I don't know.

58:20.520 --> 58:22.000
I haven't been following it that closely.

58:22.000 --> 58:23.920
Thank you to maximumfun.org for having us.

58:23.920 --> 58:26.400

58:30.600 --> 58:31.600
Hodgman.

58:40.320 --> 58:42.200
off the album Putting the Days to Bed.

58:42.200 --> 58:43.200
That's it.

58:43.200 --> 58:46.240
Let's get back to the episode and I'll talk to you next week.

58:46.240 --> 58:47.240
Bye.

58:47.240 --> 58:51.640

Listen at maximumfun.org, iTunes, or wherever you download podcasts.

59:21.680 --> 59:23.800
Should we do more questions or should we do audience?

59:23.800 --> 59:24.800
Audience questions.

59:24.800 --> 59:25.800
Yeah.

59:25.800 --> 59:26.800
Okay.

59:26.800 --> 59:27.920
Don't line up or anything.

59:27.920 --> 59:32.400
We had a miscommunication in one of our shows and people lined up and it was very intimidating.

59:32.400 --> 59:33.400
We will call on you.

59:33.400 --> 59:34.400
Can we get some house lights up?

59:34.400 --> 59:35.960
Does everybody know the rule for questions?

59:35.960 --> 59:36.960
No.

59:36.960 --> 59:37.960
Excellent.

59:37.960 --> 59:40.320
Where are the mics?

59:40.320 --> 59:41.600
And can we get even more house lights?

59:41.600 --> 59:42.600
I can't see.

59:42.600 --> 59:43.600
A little bit less us lights.

59:43.600 --> 59:44.600
There we go.

59:44.600 --> 59:46.520
I saw a person in the pink stand up.

59:46.520 --> 59:47.520
Yes.

59:47.520 --> 59:48.520
Yes.

59:48.520 --> 59:49.520
You.

59:49.520 --> 59:50.520
Yes.

59:50.520 --> 59:51.520
Come over here.

59:51.520 --> 59:52.520
Hi.

59:52.520 --> 59:53.520
What's your name?

59:53.520 --> 59:54.520
Nico.

59:54.520 --> 59:55.520
Hi, Nico.

59:55.520 --> 59:56.520
Hi.

59:56.520 --> 01:00:00.280
So, my friend eats cereal wrong.

01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:01.280
She puts cereal.

01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:05.960
I just heard a radio come on over there and I think it was a police officer who was like,

01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:06.960
be on the guard.

01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:07.960
Get ready.

01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:08.960
Okay.

01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:10.440
So, she puts cereal in one bowl.

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:13.400
Nico, by the way, you can angle if you want to angle the mic down.

01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:14.400
There we go.

01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:15.400
Okay.

01:00:15.400 --> 01:00:16.400
Like this?

01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:17.400
Perfect.

01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:18.400
Cozy.

01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:20.320
The fact that you have introduced a second bowl or instrument into the equation has me

01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:21.760
scared out of my fucking mind.

01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:22.760
Okay.

01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:23.760
Yeah.

01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:26.080
She puts cereal in one bowl and then she puts milk in the other.

01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:27.880
No way.

01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:33.040
And then she takes the cereal and puts it in the spoon and then she takes, no, she takes

01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:34.040
milk first.

01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:35.040
Okay.

01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:38.120
And then she sprinkles some cereal in the spoon and then she eats it like this.

01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:39.120
You're kidding me.

01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:40.120
No, she doesn't.

01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:41.120
Okay.

01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:42.120
Yeah.

01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:44.080
She's doing it like dipping ramen in the Japanese style.

01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:47.560
No, she gets a little spoonful of milk.

01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:48.560
Okay.

01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:49.560
No, I get it.

01:00:49.560 --> 01:00:50.560
No, yeah.

01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:51.560
No, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:52.560
I get the process.

01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:53.560
In theory, yes.

01:00:53.560 --> 01:00:54.560
Yeah.

01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:55.560
How do I fix this?

01:00:55.560 --> 01:01:01.640
Well, can I tell you the one, I do kind of get it.

01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:03.800
Oh no.

01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:08.880
Because, hear me out, I'm not, well, I am a monster, but not for this.

01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:09.880
Not a cereal monster.

01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:10.880
Yeah.

01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:11.880
S-E-R-I-A-L, maybe.

01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:12.880
Yeah, no.

01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:13.880
Yeah.

01:01:13.880 --> 01:01:14.880
I don't know.

01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:20.880
Because, because, because, because, because, because of the wonderful things he does.

01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:21.880
Wow.

01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:25.520
We've done a lot of those this show.

01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:29.760
Because if you like your cereal crunchy, you would not-

01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:30.760
Hold on, no, no, no.

01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:31.760
Stop the world.

01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:34.440
I just heard from 20 different sources, people say yes.

01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:37.360
Is there somebody else in this, and please don't fucking lie, is there somebody else

01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:38.680
in this audience who does that?

01:01:38.680 --> 01:01:39.680
Raise your hand.

01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:40.680
One, two, three, four.

01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:41.680
What?

01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:42.680
There's like four.

01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:48.120
This is a- What?

01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:54.560
This is like a 1,090 seat feeder, and four out of 1,090 is way too big of a concentration

01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:57.520
of people.

01:01:57.520 --> 01:02:02.220
I wouldn't do it, because I'm cool.

01:02:02.220 --> 01:02:03.640
You people are so cool.

01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:05.560
I'm sorry about my brother.

01:02:05.560 --> 01:02:08.440
People who raised your hand, you're cool too.

01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:10.560
I get, okay, on one hand, I get it, right?

01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:14.400
You want that crunchy bite every time, you want that feeling that just like, you know,

01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:19.000
you've got the amuse-bouche experience, or this is exactly the texture intended by the

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:20.000
chef.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:23.080
This is kind of a deconstructed cereal.

01:02:23.080 --> 01:02:24.080
That's what it is.

01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:28.760
This is exactly the crunch that the captain had in mind when he presented the bite.

01:02:28.760 --> 01:02:29.760
You'll be getting notes.

01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:31.600
This is farm fresh.

01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:37.080
When you pour it over the crunch, you lose the umami flavor that's hidden inside of it.

01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:40.480
This time we intended it to be all berries.

01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:50.600
I just, these are farm- This is oops, all farm fresh berries in season.

01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:52.920
This is yes, all berries.

01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:53.920
Yes.

01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:56.920
They are berries.

01:02:56.920 --> 01:02:59.640
I understand wanting to maintain the crunch, but all I want to say is it sounds like this

01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:07.680
method would take you about five hours to eat a bowl of cereal, and I have adult responsibilities.

01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:14.760
I like about cereal that once you pour the milk on it, the race is on.

01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:18.600
One of the things I like, think in your head about the way you eat cereal at home, and

01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:20.840
the way you've seen people eat cereal.

01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:26.280
Have you ever eaten somebody who- No, you don't eat people.

01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:27.280
Sorry.

01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:30.520
Have you seen somebody- No, hold on a second.

01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:35.840
I got a friend who eats cereal wrong with other people.

01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:39.840
I have this weird way of eating cereal where I eat other people.

01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:44.560
That's a strange way to- When I was eating Count Chocula and Counting

01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:49.280
Crunch, I thought, what if this was a real count or a real count?

01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:53.240
Have you ever watched someone eat cereal who hasn't had the expression on their face of

01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:55.600
pure determination?

01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:57.040
It's just fucking you and me now.

01:03:57.040 --> 01:04:02.440
I know when I eat cereal, well, I used to be lying in bed in pitch blackness, trying

01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:06.400
not to wake my wife up as I just shoveled it into my face.

01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:11.200
Then I got on the Bean Life, and those days are behind me now.

01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:12.760
Cereal does demand your attention.

01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:13.760
Yeah, sure.

01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:15.840
Cereal is not something you can come back to.

01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:16.840
Right.

01:04:16.840 --> 01:04:19.880
Well, I did, oh, I just poured a bowl of cereal, but I just remembered.

01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:20.880
Right.

01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:27.200
This is why I used to fuck with Crispix, because Crispix was like, don't even worry about it.

01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:28.360
Same with Cracklin' Oat Bran.

01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:30.080
Cracklin' Oat Bran, you could leave for days.

01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:34.120
Yeah, Cracklin' Oat Bran tastes like garbage no matter when you eat it.

01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:37.040
Do we have any Cracklin' Oat Bran reps here tonight?

01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:39.120
We've just been naming cereals for forever.

01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:40.120
Did we help at all?

01:04:40.120 --> 01:04:42.280
The only cereal that actually- There's no fucking marketing.

01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:43.280
It's like you don't even eat the cereal.

01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:44.280
It all gets soggy.

01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:45.280
It all gets soggy.

01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:46.280
Hey.

01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:47.280
Come on.

01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:50.200
Except for Quaker Oat Squares.

01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:51.200
Those do good.

01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:52.200
Okay.

01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:54.880
If we name one more cereal, I'm going to lose my mind.

01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:55.880
Did we help at all?

01:04:55.880 --> 01:04:56.880
Sorry, did that help?

01:04:56.880 --> 01:04:57.880
So, she's right?

01:04:57.880 --> 01:04:58.880
I guess, yeah.

01:04:58.880 --> 01:04:59.880
I would say- That's her.

01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:00.880
Oh, so you- No.

01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:01.880
I would say- I thought you said they weren't here.

01:05:01.880 --> 01:05:02.880
No, I didn't say anything.

01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:03.880
She's here.

01:05:03.880 --> 01:05:04.880
She's right here.

01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:05.880
Oh, shit.

01:05:05.880 --> 01:05:06.880
Oh, God.

01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:15.880
I think you are maybe not right, but justified.

01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:17.880
You're not right, but you're loved.

01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:18.880
How's that?

01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:19.880
Thank you so much.

01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:20.880
Wait, wait.

01:05:20.880 --> 01:05:21.880
Okay.

01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:22.880
All right.

01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:23.880
Now, she wants to spit.

01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:24.880
Okay.

01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:25.880
No, no, no.

01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:27.360
Please address the court.

01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:29.520
Every bite is the first bite.

01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:30.520
TM.

01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:31.520
Thank you.

01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:32.520
Thank you.

01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:33.520
Thank you.

01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:34.520
Thank you.

01:05:34.520 --> 01:05:35.520
Thank you.

01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:36.520
Thank you.

01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:37.520
Thank you.

01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:38.520
Thank you.

01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:39.520
Thank you.

01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:40.520
Thank you.

01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:41.520
Thank you.

01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:42.520
Thank you.

01:05:42.520 --> 01:05:43.520
Thank you.

01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:44.520
Thank you.

01:05:44.520 --> 01:05:45.520
Thank you.

01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:46.520
Thank you.

01:05:46.520 --> 01:05:47.520
Thank you.

01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:48.520
Thank you.

01:05:48.520 --> 01:05:49.520
Thank you.

01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:52.600
You 100% cannot trademark a way of eating cereal, but I appreciate.

01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:53.600
Yes.

01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:54.600
Okay.

01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:55.600
That's a lot of hands up.

01:05:55.600 --> 01:05:56.600
Garfield, the deals wizard.

01:05:56.600 --> 01:05:57.600
Warlock.

01:05:57.600 --> 01:05:58.600
How does he do this?

01:05:58.600 --> 01:05:59.600
Yeah.

01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:00.600
Hello.

01:06:00.600 --> 01:06:01.600
But you do have to remove the mask.

01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:02.600
Hello, boy.

01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:03.600
Oh, shit.

01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:04.600
No, no, no, no.

01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:05.600
You can't.

01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:06.600
No, I'm just kidding.

01:06:06.600 --> 01:06:07.600
Okay.

01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:08.600
What's your name?

01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:09.600
Oh, God.

01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:10.600
Oh, God.

01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:11.600
Oh, God.

01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:15.640
Oh, God.

01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:16.640
I'm Anna.

01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:17.640
Hi, Anna.

01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:18.640
Hi.

01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:19.640
So, hi.

01:06:19.640 --> 01:06:21.640
My friend's back there.

01:06:21.640 --> 01:06:24.440
So, I look very young.

01:06:24.440 --> 01:06:29.240
I have been told that I'm not allowed to buy a lottery ticket, which seems ridiculous.

01:06:29.240 --> 01:06:31.440
No, that's because we're worried about you.

01:06:31.440 --> 01:06:32.820
Okay.

01:06:32.820 --> 01:06:34.600
Thank you for your concern.

01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:39.800
And it's not especially helpful when I'm, say, at Pride and trying to talk to girls.

01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:40.800
Okay.

01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:45.560
So, how do I portray myself as an older person?

01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:46.560
Shit.

01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:49.680
Smoke a pipe, maybe a corduroy jacket.

01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:51.480
I was about to suggest, like, oh, this is easy.

01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:53.200
You just show them your license.

01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:55.320
But that only fixes the lottery ticket thing.

01:06:55.320 --> 01:06:58.240
This is not something you're probably to do, ladies.

01:06:58.240 --> 01:07:00.880
No, pleasure to meet you all.

01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:05.560
As you can see, I am from Maryland, read it and weep.

01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:06.560
How do you...

01:07:06.560 --> 01:07:09.360
How do you portray yourself as older?

01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:11.360
Try to look younger.

01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:12.360
Okay.

01:07:12.360 --> 01:07:13.360
All right.

01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:14.360
That's so...

01:07:14.360 --> 01:07:26.600
Can we take a moment and appreciate that that's the most insightful thing any of us have ever

01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:27.600
said in the history...

01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:28.600
Yeah.

01:07:28.600 --> 01:07:31.600
...of the fucking seven years we've been doing this podcast?

01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:32.600
Yeah.

01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:35.480
If you want to look like a 50-year-old uncle, you can borrow my shirt.

01:07:35.480 --> 01:07:36.480
Yeah.

01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:38.480
Options available to you.

01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:39.480
Yeah.

01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:40.480
I mean...

01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:44.600
The easiest thing to do is when someone, like, says, like, oh, you're not older, like, say,

01:07:44.600 --> 01:07:45.600
like, I'm flat.

01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:46.600
Thank you.

01:07:46.600 --> 01:07:47.600
Oh, you don't know how young that makes you feel.

01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:48.600
Thank you.

01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:49.600
I'm 32.

01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:50.600
Oh, thank you.

01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:51.600
You don't know how...

01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:52.600
Wait, wait, what?

01:07:52.600 --> 01:07:53.600
No shit, huh?

01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:54.600
No, no, no, no.

01:07:54.600 --> 01:07:55.600
I'm 18.

01:07:55.600 --> 01:07:56.600
Okay.

01:07:56.600 --> 01:07:57.600
Okay.

01:07:57.600 --> 01:07:58.600
Wait, hold on.

01:07:58.600 --> 01:07:59.600
Wait.

01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:01.600
You can't be 18 and say, I look young.

01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:02.600
You are!

01:08:02.600 --> 01:08:03.600
Jacuzzi.

01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:11.440
Unless they're looking at you and going, but you're a baby, what are you doing driving

01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:12.440
a car?

01:08:12.440 --> 01:08:15.760
No, no, the problem is that pride girls who are, like, 13 come to talk to me.

01:08:15.760 --> 01:08:16.760
That's a no-go.

01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:17.760
Okay, okay.

01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:18.760
Yes.

01:08:18.760 --> 01:08:19.760
Okay, okay.

01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:20.760
Yeah, the stakes are very high.

01:08:20.760 --> 01:08:21.760
I get it.

01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:22.760
And we're all on the same page.

01:08:22.760 --> 01:08:23.760
Yeah, we've all gotten there.

01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:24.760
That's the problem.

01:08:24.760 --> 01:08:25.760
Yeah, now I'm with you.

01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:31.000
Listen, I had this problem where people used to say that I looked way too young for my

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:32.000
age.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:37.760
So, now the salient advice I could offer you is just wait.

01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:38.760
Just hang in there.

01:08:38.760 --> 01:08:39.760
It ain't a forever problem.

01:08:39.760 --> 01:08:41.480
Yeah, it's not a forever problem.

01:08:41.480 --> 01:08:43.480
This problem will resolve itself.

01:08:43.480 --> 01:08:44.480
Okay.

01:08:44.480 --> 01:08:45.480
All right.

01:08:45.480 --> 01:08:46.480
Savor this problem.

01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:52.600
Oh my God, grab this problem and hold it so, so close because one day you might do a podcast

01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:55.800
where a bunch of people take pictures of you on a street and then you see those pictures

01:08:55.800 --> 01:08:59.760
on Twitter and you go, I look like I'm fucking 55.

01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:02.200
What happened?

01:09:02.200 --> 01:09:04.800
Oh, my mom also is a haunted dog today.

01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:05.800
Oh, nice.

01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:06.800
That's amazing.

01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:07.800
Spirit orbs and everything.

01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:08.800
Wow.

01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:09.800
Thank you.

01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:10.800
That's the life form.

01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:11.800
That rules.

01:09:11.800 --> 01:09:12.800
Did we help?

01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:13.800
Does that help?

01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:14.800
Yeah.

01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:15.800
The tides of time will take me through this problem.

01:09:15.800 --> 01:09:16.800
There you go.

01:09:16.800 --> 01:09:19.800
Yeah, maybe make some hard life decisions.

01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:20.800
Yeah.

01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:24.800
Wait for the reaper ever patient to claim you.

01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:30.200
How about, there's people pointing to this person sitting very up front.

01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:31.200
Yes.

01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:32.200
Yes.

01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:33.200
Come on down.

01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:34.200
Come on up.

01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:35.200
Yeah.

01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:36.200
Yeah.

01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:37.200
Yeah.

01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:38.200
No glasses.

01:09:38.200 --> 01:09:39.200
No glasses.

01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:40.200
There's a defining detail we gave you.

01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:41.200
You got to work your way back.

01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:42.200
There's a mic back there.

01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:43.200
Uh-oh.

01:09:43.200 --> 01:09:44.200
Wait.

01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:45.200
Fight your way through.

01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:46.200
This is your moment.

01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:47.200
All right.

01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:48.200
Fill the time.

01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:49.200
Hey, that question about bathrooms was funny.

01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:50.200
Okay.

01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:51.200
No, there's a mic over here.

01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:52.200
We're going to call on somebody more in this region.

01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:53.200
No.

01:09:53.200 --> 01:09:54.200
We'll come back to you.

01:09:54.200 --> 01:09:55.200
Okay.

01:09:55.200 --> 01:09:56.200
Find your way to one, but we're going to call somebody else.

01:09:56.200 --> 01:09:57.200
Oh, no.

01:09:57.200 --> 01:09:58.200
Wait.

01:09:58.200 --> 01:09:59.200
They're going to be there in three seconds.

01:09:59.200 --> 01:10:00.200
You're right.

01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:01.200
Okay.

01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:02.200
We will wait patiently for you.

01:10:02.200 --> 01:10:03.200
Hello.

01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:04.200
Hi, brothers.

01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:05.200
Hi.

01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:07.200
I also just want to say a brief apology to the people who happen to fall within the sphere

01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:11.000
of light of the mic who are just trying to sit there and not be noticed.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:12.000
Our featured players.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:13.000
I'm noticing you.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:14.000
Hi.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:15.000
What's your name?

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:16.000
I'm Lauren.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:17.000
Hi, Lauren.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:18.000
Hi, Lauren.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:23.920
So a couple months ago for my brother's birthday, I made a terrible mistake and made him a

01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:32.280
Danny DeVito paper mache bust.

01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:36.800
Those two phrases cannot be adjacent to each other.

01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:42.560
I've made a terrible mistake and made a Danny DeVito shaped bust.

01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:47.440
Those two phrases need to be a day apart from each other.

01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:48.440
Right.

01:10:48.440 --> 01:10:51.800
I spent a lot of time with it making it.

01:10:51.800 --> 01:10:55.920
And hence, not a mistake, falling in love with it.

01:10:55.920 --> 01:11:01.820
It's just, his unblinking eyes terrify me and it really gives off a negative energy

01:11:01.820 --> 01:11:04.320
and he has it like right when you walk into his place.

01:11:04.320 --> 01:11:05.320
Ah, damn.

01:11:05.320 --> 01:11:08.960
Just fucking hanging from the ceiling like a trap it swings down into you.

01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:12.480
Kind of a Lionel Richie hello situation at this point.

01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:13.480
Right.

01:11:13.480 --> 01:11:14.480
Yes.

01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:16.640
How do I get over my fear of this paper man?

01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:18.120
Well, you made it.

01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:19.120
I know.

01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:20.120
Yeah.

01:11:20.120 --> 01:11:21.120
You're its creator.

01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:23.240
You know you have the right to destroy it.

01:11:23.240 --> 01:11:24.240
Okay.

01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:25.240
Wait.

01:11:25.240 --> 01:11:26.240
I have a very important question.

01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:27.240
Yes.

01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:28.240
Is it your brother?

01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:29.240
Right?

01:11:29.240 --> 01:11:30.240
I'm not Danny DeVito.

01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:31.240
Wait.

01:11:31.240 --> 01:11:32.240
What?

01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:33.240
It's my boyfriend.

01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:34.240
Boyfriend.

01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:35.240
Boyfriend.

01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:36.240
Sorry.

01:11:36.240 --> 01:11:40.080
Was your, is your boyfriend, was your boyfriend a fan of Danny DeVito or was it just a funny

01:11:40.080 --> 01:11:41.080
thing you did?

01:11:41.080 --> 01:11:42.080
No.

01:11:42.080 --> 01:11:43.080
He's a fan of Danny DeVito.

01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:44.080
He's here.

01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:45.080
Enough so.

01:11:45.080 --> 01:11:46.080
Okay.

01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:55.240
Did you know that when this paper mache bust was given to you, was this a, this was made

01:11:55.240 --> 01:12:06.640
and given to me in love, so I'll display it or oh snap, Danny DeVito, I love that guy.

01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:07.640
Raw passion.

01:12:07.640 --> 01:12:08.640
Raw passion.

01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:09.640
Raw passion.

01:12:09.640 --> 01:12:14.400
The only thing to feel for Danny, um, what, what's like, uh, what's like your favorite

01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:15.400
small thing?

01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:17.840
Like if you had, like if you had, like walked into your room and there was like a little

01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:18.840
handheld thing.

01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:19.840
Danny DeVito.

01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:23.880
He is known to be a short man.

01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:25.880
I am not telling tales out of school.

01:12:25.880 --> 01:12:26.880
He's doing his best.

01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:27.880
To be tall?

01:12:27.880 --> 01:12:28.880
Yeah.

01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:29.880
Like a little handheld thing.

01:12:29.880 --> 01:12:32.400
If you walked in, like a favorite, like a favorite, like candy or a toy or a little

01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:39.320
gizmo or what it's, what's your, it's the fucking wildest question anybody's ever asked

01:12:39.320 --> 01:12:40.320
anybody.

01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:41.320
Okay.

01:12:41.320 --> 01:12:42.320
Ashtrays.

01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:44.120
So say you collect ashtrays.

01:12:44.120 --> 01:12:45.160
This is not what I wanted.

01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:48.520
I know where you're going with this and you've asked as a terrible thing.

01:12:48.520 --> 01:12:50.000
You do you like candy?

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:51.000
Do you like candy?

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:52.000
Yes.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:53.000
Okay.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:54.000
Thank you.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:55.000
Bit.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:56.000
Bit.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:57.000
Bit.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:58.000
I like bit of honey.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:12:59.000
Okay.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:00.000
Cool.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:01.000
I love bit of honey.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
Jam a bunch of bit of honey up in that Danny DeVito.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:07.320
And then you walk in and he's like, oh, it sounds like it's rattling around.

01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:08.320
Yeah.

01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:09.320
Here's a big stick.

01:13:09.320 --> 01:13:11.920
And now all of a sudden.

01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:13.400
It's a Dan Yato.

01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:14.400
It's a Dan Yato.

01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:24.520
It's a, it's a, a poignant, probably difficult, but rewarding way to say goodbye to this nightmare.

01:13:24.520 --> 01:13:25.520
Yeah.

01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:27.920
But God, that's going to be therapeutic though.

01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:28.920
Oof.

01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:32.800
I bet by the end of it, you won't be afraid of Danny DeVito the person.

01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:34.360
And then you'll miss the bust.

01:13:34.360 --> 01:13:35.360
Yeah.

01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:36.360
I have a picture.

01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:37.360
Would you like to see it?

01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:38.360
No.

01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:39.360
Absolutely.

01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:40.360
Yeah.

01:13:40.360 --> 01:13:41.360
Yeah.

01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:50.080
Oh shit, it is really good.

01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:55.080
That's terrifying.

01:13:55.080 --> 01:13:56.080
That is really good.

01:13:56.080 --> 01:13:58.880
Can you email that to us so you can put it on Twitter for the episode?

01:13:58.880 --> 01:13:59.880
Can you do that for us?

01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:00.880
Thank you.

01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:01.880
Um, did we help?

01:14:01.880 --> 01:14:02.880
Did we help?

01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:09.160
Hey, that reminded me, um, happy birthday to Josh because I told someone in the line

01:14:09.160 --> 01:14:10.160
that happy birthday to Josh.

01:14:10.160 --> 01:14:11.160
Josh.

01:14:11.160 --> 01:14:12.160
Happy birthday.

01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:13.160
Happy birthday.

01:14:13.160 --> 01:14:16.160
Uh, did we help you with your Danny DeVito problem?

01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:17.160
Great.

01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:18.160
Thank you.

01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:19.160
Wait.

01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:22.760
Oh, uh, right here in the corner.

01:14:22.760 --> 01:14:23.760
Yes.

01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:24.760
Behind the water bottle.

01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:25.760
Yes.

01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:26.760
Please stand up.

01:14:26.760 --> 01:14:27.760
Yes.

01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:28.760
Yes.

01:14:28.760 --> 01:14:29.760
You.

01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:30.760
Yes.

01:14:30.760 --> 01:14:31.760
Come on down.

01:14:31.760 --> 01:14:32.760
You can leave.

01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:33.760
Oh, stunts.

01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:36.760
I hope you all signed your liability waivers.

01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:37.760
I'm good.

01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:38.760
Thank you.

01:14:38.760 --> 01:14:39.760
Hi, what's your name?

01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:40.760
My name is Sarah.

01:14:40.760 --> 01:14:41.760
Sarah.

01:14:41.760 --> 01:14:42.760
Can you angle the mic back up to point at your face?

01:14:42.760 --> 01:14:43.760
Yeah.

01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:44.760
Got you.

01:14:44.760 --> 01:14:45.760
There we go.

01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:46.760
Hi.

01:14:46.760 --> 01:14:47.760
Oh, apparently I have it now.

01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:48.760
Oh, shit.

01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:49.760
Now it's time for your type five.

01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:53.760
So, um, I ride a lot of Ubers and to get back and forth to school and the thing is-

01:14:53.760 --> 01:14:54.760
On top like Teen Wolf?

01:14:54.760 --> 01:14:55.760
Yes, actually.

01:14:55.760 --> 01:15:02.160
And the thing is, is that, um, I tend to get a little, uh, creative when people talk to

01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:07.200
me and I kind of like make up a story about whatever I'm doing that day to keep it more

01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:08.200
interesting.

01:15:08.200 --> 01:15:09.200
Sure.

01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:10.200
Lying.

01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:11.200
Yeah.

01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:12.200
Yeah.

01:15:12.200 --> 01:15:13.200
You know, just keeps it fun.

01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:14.200
Um.

01:15:14.200 --> 01:15:15.200
Sure.

01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:16.200
Lying.

01:15:16.200 --> 01:15:17.200
Yeah.

01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:18.200
Just a fun lie.

01:15:18.200 --> 01:15:19.200
So here's the thing.

01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:20.200
Are you lying right now?

01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:21.200
No.

01:15:21.200 --> 01:15:22.200
Yeah, is this a lie?

01:15:22.200 --> 01:15:23.200
How do I know?

01:15:23.200 --> 01:15:24.200
I guess we're going to get to that.

01:15:24.200 --> 01:15:25.200
Okay.

01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:28.200
Um, so I got into my last Uber last week and the guy told me-

01:15:28.200 --> 01:15:29.200
Finally kicked the habit.

01:15:29.200 --> 01:15:30.200
No.

01:15:30.200 --> 01:15:31.200
Yeah.

01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:32.200
Okay.

01:15:32.200 --> 01:15:36.680
And I found, the guy was telling me how he's actually friends with a lot of the other Uber

01:15:36.680 --> 01:15:37.680
drivers in that area.

01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:38.680
Oh, fuck.

01:15:38.680 --> 01:15:39.680
Shit.

01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:40.680
Fuck.

01:15:40.680 --> 01:15:41.680
Fuck.

01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:42.680
Fuck.

01:15:42.680 --> 01:15:43.680
Fuck.

01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:44.680
Fuck.

01:15:44.680 --> 01:15:45.680
Fuck.

01:15:45.680 --> 01:15:46.680
Fuck.

01:15:46.680 --> 01:15:47.680
Fuck.

01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:48.680
So I don't know what I should do.

01:15:48.680 --> 01:15:52.040
Should I continue this fun little storytelling habit or?

01:15:52.040 --> 01:15:55.360
Storytelling again is an extremely generous way of describing this habit.

01:15:55.360 --> 01:15:56.360
Wait.

01:15:56.360 --> 01:15:57.360
Hold on.

01:15:57.360 --> 01:15:58.360
Wait.

01:15:58.360 --> 01:15:59.360
I was about to-

01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:00.360
You're not Stephen King.

01:16:00.360 --> 01:16:01.360
You are lying.

01:16:01.360 --> 01:16:04.360
The Garrison Keillor of Uber.

01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:07.440
Hey, look who I picked up.

01:16:07.440 --> 01:16:09.920
That's the old tail spinner.

01:16:09.920 --> 01:16:11.280
It's been one of their old tails.

01:16:11.280 --> 01:16:14.520
I have a super important further details question.

01:16:14.520 --> 01:16:15.520
Let's do it.

01:16:15.520 --> 01:16:16.520
These stories.

01:16:16.520 --> 01:16:17.520
Yeah.

01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:18.520
How outlandish are they?

01:16:18.520 --> 01:16:19.520
They're not actually that crazy.

01:16:19.520 --> 01:16:25.160
I'll just, you know, make up the fact that I'm going to visit some front.

01:16:25.160 --> 01:16:26.160
I'm going to work.

01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:27.160
Or I'll be like-

01:16:27.160 --> 01:16:28.160
Good news.

01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:29.160
You're fine.

01:16:29.160 --> 01:16:30.160
You're cool.

01:16:30.160 --> 01:16:31.160
Yeah, you're fine.

01:16:31.160 --> 01:16:32.160
Those Uber drivers are not getting together.

01:16:32.160 --> 01:16:33.160
I'm like, you'll never believe.

01:16:33.160 --> 01:16:34.160
I picked up this person.

01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:35.160
They were going to visit a friend.

01:16:35.160 --> 01:16:36.160
Yeah, no.

01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:37.640
They were saying like, hey, what's up?

01:16:37.640 --> 01:16:38.640
Thanks for getting me.

01:16:38.640 --> 01:16:40.840
I'm going down to like 45th in Congress.

01:16:40.840 --> 01:16:41.840
And also when I was a kid-

01:16:41.840 --> 01:16:44.400
I mean, they get a little bit more elaborate down the line.

01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:49.200
One time I drank a swimming pool, like, oh shit.

01:16:49.200 --> 01:16:53.840
They get a little bit more elaborate as they go along, but it's like a fun ad-libs games

01:16:53.840 --> 01:16:54.840
the way that I see it.

01:16:54.840 --> 01:17:00.240
One, I think we have established there's no such thing as a fun ad-libs game.

01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:01.240
That's me saying that.

01:17:01.240 --> 01:17:05.440
But it's like, I'm getting into a car with someone I'm never going to meet again.

01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:06.440
May as well.

01:17:06.440 --> 01:17:07.440
May as well lie to them.

01:17:07.440 --> 01:17:09.920
That's how I go through life.

01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:13.200
At the bank, like, yeah, here's my check that I'm depositing.

01:17:13.200 --> 01:17:18.600
One time I jumped up on top of a school bus and rode it like Teen Wolf.

01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:22.840
God, I got Teen Wolf on the brain tonight.

01:17:22.840 --> 01:17:23.840
Don't sweat it.

01:17:23.840 --> 01:17:24.840
Don't sweat it.

01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:25.840
I think you're good.

01:17:25.840 --> 01:17:26.840
You're totally cool.

01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:30.560
They probably appreciate the levity, I would guess, right?

01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:33.880
Maybe next time you get out of an Uber, hop out and just say like, by the way, I lied

01:17:33.880 --> 01:17:34.880
that whole time.

01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:35.880
I'm going to work.

01:17:35.880 --> 01:17:36.880
Now that's a story they'll tell people.

01:17:36.880 --> 01:17:37.880
That's a good story.

01:17:37.880 --> 01:17:38.880
It's the ultimate power play.

01:17:38.880 --> 01:17:39.880
Yeah.

01:17:39.880 --> 01:17:40.880
Exactly.

01:17:40.880 --> 01:17:41.880
By the way.

01:17:41.880 --> 01:17:42.880
Psych.

01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:43.880
Does that help?

01:17:43.880 --> 01:17:44.880
Yeah.

01:17:44.880 --> 01:17:45.880
Thank you.

01:17:45.880 --> 01:17:46.880
Excellent.

01:17:46.880 --> 01:17:47.880
Thank you.

01:17:47.880 --> 01:17:48.880
Okay.

01:17:48.880 --> 01:17:56.200
Someone did a phone flashlight.

01:17:56.200 --> 01:17:57.800
Don't anyone ever do that again.

01:17:57.800 --> 01:17:58.800
But this is the last time.

01:17:58.800 --> 01:17:59.800
The last time that'll work.

01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:00.800
Yes.

01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:03.880
It's the first time and only time anyone's ever done it.

01:18:03.880 --> 01:18:04.880
And it works.

01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:05.880
Come on down.

01:18:05.880 --> 01:18:06.880
The person with the phone flashlight.

01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:09.320
It does make it so I don't have to cover up the house lights.

01:18:09.320 --> 01:18:11.860
Oh, shit.

01:18:11.860 --> 01:18:14.800
Everybody in the audience apparently knows that it's your birthday.

01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:18.440
We won't sing the song because it takes forever and it's not a very good tune.

01:18:18.440 --> 01:18:19.440
But happy birthday.

01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:20.440
Thank you.

01:18:20.440 --> 01:18:22.400
Everyone sang to me before you guys came out.

01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:23.400
Oh, good.

01:18:23.400 --> 01:18:27.040
By the way, also, when we came out, we said hey and high-fived a bunch of folks before

01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:28.360
the show started.

01:18:28.360 --> 01:18:32.560
And apparently there was a mass banana crunch that happened out there.

01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:34.480
You can cheer if you want.

01:18:34.480 --> 01:18:41.200
But that was, I can't imagine the sonic experience for the people eating at the Panera Bread across

01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:42.200
the street.

01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:43.200
What's your name?

01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:44.200
Charlie.

01:18:44.200 --> 01:18:45.200
I tried.

01:18:45.200 --> 01:18:50.640
A lot of Charlie fans in the audience, two nights.

01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:52.240
So I'm a college student.

01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:53.680
I live like up the block.

01:18:53.680 --> 01:18:54.680
It's great, isn't it?

01:18:54.680 --> 01:18:55.680
Oh, college.

01:18:55.680 --> 01:18:56.680
So good.

01:18:56.680 --> 01:18:57.680
It's the best.

01:18:57.680 --> 01:19:00.760
Stop rubbing it in, Charlie.

01:19:00.760 --> 01:19:05.160
So I live with some suitemates this year and I moved in before them.

01:19:05.160 --> 01:19:06.160
That's one of them.

01:19:06.160 --> 01:19:08.240
Holy shit.

01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:13.760
And as a fun little joke, I found this toddler's bike in one of the trash rooms in my dorm

01:19:13.760 --> 01:19:16.000
and I put it under someone's bed.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.920
Wait, there's, wait, yeah, hold on.

01:19:18.920 --> 01:19:23.760
You jumped over the interesting, the like spooky part there, which was.

01:19:23.760 --> 01:19:24.960
Yeah.

01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:27.920
So there's this trash room in school and there was like-

01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:28.920
Get that.

01:19:28.920 --> 01:19:29.920
Uh-huh.

01:19:29.920 --> 01:19:35.600
Someone, there was like, uh, not toddlers, but it's a high school musical small bike

01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:38.720
and it's pink and it's got Barbie on it also.

01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:41.640
But it's not toddlers.

01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:42.640
It's for small children.

01:19:42.640 --> 01:19:43.640
Okay.

01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:44.640
Okay.

01:19:44.640 --> 01:19:45.640
Okay.

01:19:45.640 --> 01:19:46.640
I'm with you.

01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:47.640
I'm with you.

01:19:47.640 --> 01:19:49.760
So I thought it would be real funny to just like leave it there and then like I just throw

01:19:49.760 --> 01:19:51.560
it out when someone found it.

01:19:51.560 --> 01:19:52.560
Yeah.

01:19:52.560 --> 01:19:55.160
But now it's like a part of where we live.

01:19:55.160 --> 01:19:56.960
Have they not discovered it?

01:19:56.960 --> 01:20:01.160
They have and they love it.

01:20:01.160 --> 01:20:02.160
What's the problem?

01:20:02.160 --> 01:20:03.160
Yeah.

01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:04.160
Cause now it's part of-

01:20:04.160 --> 01:20:06.200
You gave someone a gift is what that's called.

01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:07.200
Yeah.

01:20:07.200 --> 01:20:08.200
Yeah.

01:20:08.200 --> 01:20:09.200
What's the issue?

01:20:09.200 --> 01:20:10.200
We live in a very small dorm.

01:20:10.200 --> 01:20:13.280
I was about to say, I have an issue with it and that is like, where are you going to put

01:20:13.280 --> 01:20:14.720
this kid's bike?

01:20:14.720 --> 01:20:20.600
I live in a house I bought and I still don't have room for a kid's bike somewhere.

01:20:20.600 --> 01:20:21.600
Sorry Henry.

01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:25.440
It's nine months old.

01:20:25.440 --> 01:20:29.840
So where do you, what should you, is it worth the memories and the goof to keep this very

01:20:29.840 --> 01:20:31.880
inconvenient bicycle somewhere in your house?

01:20:31.880 --> 01:20:34.840
I have asked to get rid of it a few times and they say no.

01:20:34.840 --> 01:20:35.840
You got to pay it forward.

01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:36.840
You got to sneak it back out.

01:20:36.840 --> 01:20:41.060
The problem is you're going to need an alibi.

01:20:41.060 --> 01:20:44.560
The only problem is the only place you can put it is apparently the trash room and they're

01:20:44.560 --> 01:20:46.440
going to know right where the fuck to find it.

01:20:46.440 --> 01:20:49.240
Oh, maybe that's what, that's the cycle.

01:20:49.240 --> 01:20:51.000
That's the cycle.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:55.480
Tell them that you know they love the bike, but it's someone else's turn to love the bike,

01:20:55.480 --> 01:20:57.320
so you have to return it from whence it came.

01:20:57.320 --> 01:20:59.040
Let me ask you a question because I had a good idea.

01:20:59.040 --> 01:21:00.840
Do you, oh, we have additional details?

01:21:00.840 --> 01:21:01.840
Okay.

01:21:01.840 --> 01:21:02.840
Hold on one second.

01:21:02.840 --> 01:21:05.440
I love, this is the show of, well let me chime in here.

01:21:05.440 --> 01:21:06.440
Let me, hold on.

01:21:06.440 --> 01:21:07.440
Let me take a swing at it.

01:21:07.440 --> 01:21:08.440
You fucked up.

01:21:08.440 --> 01:21:09.440
I got this.

01:21:09.440 --> 01:21:10.440
What's your name?

01:21:10.440 --> 01:21:11.440
Sarah.

01:21:11.440 --> 01:21:12.440
Hi Sarah.

01:21:12.440 --> 01:21:13.440
And you know Charlie, right?

01:21:13.440 --> 01:21:16.240
Like this isn't just like, all right Charlie, you're done.

01:21:16.240 --> 01:21:17.240
My question.

01:21:17.240 --> 01:21:18.240
I also have a bike story.

01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:19.560
We are sweet mates.

01:21:19.560 --> 01:21:21.640
I have seen the bike firsthand.

01:21:21.640 --> 01:21:23.560
It is beautiful.

01:21:23.560 --> 01:21:24.560
Thank you.

01:21:24.560 --> 01:21:25.560
Okay, okay.

01:21:25.560 --> 01:21:26.560
Now this check is at everything.

01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:27.560
Wait, no, no, wait.

01:21:27.560 --> 01:21:32.160
Is there more to the... Yeah, it has two flat tires.

01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:37.880
Well, I wasn't... Oh, so you can't ride it.

01:21:37.880 --> 01:21:38.880
Well.

01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:39.880
No, I get why.

01:21:39.880 --> 01:21:42.320
It answers my question, which is why did somebody throw this bike away, and I think it's because

01:21:42.320 --> 01:21:47.680
they got to your school, and they were like, fuck this junk.

01:21:47.680 --> 01:21:50.800
Okay, so here was my question.

01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:55.120
Does your school have an art department?

01:21:55.120 --> 01:21:56.120
It is an art school.

01:21:56.120 --> 01:21:57.120
It's an art school.

01:21:57.120 --> 01:21:58.120
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

01:21:58.120 --> 01:22:05.600
Are you... There's a Barbie toddler bike in the treasure of course it's an art school.

01:22:05.600 --> 01:22:09.560
Don't kid yourself.

01:22:09.560 --> 01:22:12.520
Can you commission a painting of this bike?

01:22:12.520 --> 01:22:13.880
Oh shit.

01:22:13.880 --> 01:22:17.760
You changed the number of dimensions in which the bike is available.

01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:18.760
Exactly.

01:22:18.760 --> 01:22:23.440
It was previously a three-dimensional... Paintings don't got kickstands unless they're on an

01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:27.000
easel, which is kind of like a kickstand for a painting.

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:28.000
You solved this.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:29.000
Yeah, I did.

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:30.000
Yeah, I know.

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:31.000
I was very excited about it.

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:32.000
Let's go out on a high.

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:33.000
Yeah.

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:34.000
Do we help?

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:35.000
Yes, so much.

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:36.000
Thank you.

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:43.840
All right, we have to wrap up because we are doing another show in like an hour, and that's

01:22:43.840 --> 01:22:45.560
wild to me.

01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:49.840
That show's going to suck compared to this one.

01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:55.440
Unless some of you bought tickets to both, in which case it will be just as good.

01:22:55.440 --> 01:23:00.720
It is, I should warn you though, all the same jokes, so sorry in advance.

01:23:00.720 --> 01:23:02.880
Please come back and ask your bike question again.

01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:07.000
I want to let everyone know, we have posters out in the lobby.

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:08.720
If you haven't checked them out, they are beautiful.

01:23:08.720 --> 01:23:11.720
Oh, thanks to Kevin Budnick for designing them.

01:23:11.720 --> 01:23:13.720
Yeah, Kevin Budnick did those, and they're great.

01:23:13.720 --> 01:23:20.760
Thank you to John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song, It's Departure.

01:23:20.760 --> 01:23:24.640
Thank you to Paul who has helped us this entire tour.

01:23:24.640 --> 01:23:25.640
It's so, so, so much.

01:23:25.640 --> 01:23:26.640
Thank you, Paul.

01:23:26.640 --> 01:23:27.640
Thank you, Paul.

01:23:27.640 --> 01:23:28.640
Thank you to the Wilbur.

01:23:28.640 --> 01:23:29.640
This is Wilbur's beautiful place.

01:23:29.640 --> 01:23:30.640
Thank you to the Wilbur.

01:23:30.640 --> 01:23:35.640
Again, we've done two very good shows here now, and that means a lot.

01:23:35.640 --> 01:23:36.640
Thank you, Wilbur.

01:23:36.640 --> 01:23:37.640
You know what?

01:23:37.640 --> 01:23:38.640
Thank you, Boston.

01:23:38.640 --> 01:23:39.640
Thanks, Boston.

01:23:39.640 --> 01:23:40.640
All right.

01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:46.440
Now, every week on My Brother, My Brother and Me, Griffin gives us the last question

01:23:46.440 --> 01:23:50.760
that we ruminate on and then revisit the next week.

01:23:50.760 --> 01:23:53.520
Griffin, what is that question this time?

01:23:53.520 --> 01:23:56.400
I'm very excited for the discussion next week on this topic.

01:23:56.400 --> 01:23:57.400
Oh, wait.

01:23:57.400 --> 01:24:00.040
I should mention, we are...

01:24:00.040 --> 01:24:01.040
We will not be able to...

01:24:01.040 --> 01:24:02.520
Yeah, we can't hang out after the show.

01:24:02.520 --> 01:24:03.520
Sorry.

01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:04.520
Because we have to do another one.

01:24:04.520 --> 01:24:05.520
There's literally no way that time...

01:24:05.520 --> 01:24:06.520
That's how time works.

01:24:06.520 --> 01:24:09.220
But we met a bunch of you before the show, and you were all super cool, so thanks for

01:24:09.220 --> 01:24:11.200
shaking our hands and high-fiving with us.

01:24:11.200 --> 01:24:13.200
You're the best.

01:24:13.200 --> 01:24:14.200
Okay.

01:24:14.200 --> 01:24:19.120
A lot of you had sticky banana fingers from the bananas you crunched, and I will never

01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:20.120
forgive you.

01:24:20.120 --> 01:24:23.040
So, this was sent in by the delivery man, Seth Carlson.

01:24:23.040 --> 01:24:24.040
Thank you, Seth.

01:24:24.040 --> 01:24:28.920
Finally, God, it's from Yahoo Answers user, Curtis.

01:24:28.920 --> 01:24:32.080
We've been waiting for Curtis to hear his thoughts.

01:24:32.080 --> 01:24:39.160
Curtis asks, if you die on an operating table but come back to life, is your birthday changed?

01:24:39.160 --> 01:24:44.520
My name is Justin McElroy.

01:24:44.520 --> 01:24:45.520
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:24:45.520 --> 01:24:46.520
I'm Griffin McElroy.

01:24:46.520 --> 01:24:47.520
This has been My Brother, My Brother, Meek.

01:24:47.520 --> 01:25:17.440
Is your dad square on the lips?

01:25:17.440 --> 01:25:41.440
Yes, he is.
