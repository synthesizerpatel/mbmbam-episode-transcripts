00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:50.480
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me, where we have sprung into fall.

00:51.680 --> 00:58.080
Is that? We sprung a leak. I fell into fall. You trip, you trip forward.

00:58.080 --> 01:05.120
Hold on. We jumped up, we reached for fall, we missed it. There's a lot of leaves and branches

01:05.120 --> 01:12.320
and debris on the ground, and so you slip and trip forward into the fall hour, and then in the spring,

01:12.880 --> 01:19.200
you have to wind the springs of your clock backwards. I will make a confession for you

01:19.200 --> 01:28.960
right now. Everyone has that childhood, that fun childhood memory of their poppy or their peepums

01:28.960 --> 01:38.320
raking up a big pile of autumnal leaves and leaping into that pile. I have no memory of

01:38.320 --> 01:46.480
ever doing that, and I am worried the ship has sailed. I'm worried that if I were to now leap

01:46.480 --> 01:53.600
into a pile of leaves, I would be perhaps given a lollipop. Now what you do is you you rake up

01:53.600 --> 02:00.000
the pile of leaves and then you just like slowly lay down in it and go to sleep. Yeah, it's a good

02:00.000 --> 02:05.520
that it's a good place for a nap or actually not because uh one time the last time I jumped into a

02:05.520 --> 02:12.640
pile of leaves in Ironton, Ohio, a spider bit me right on the hand and it swelled up and I never

02:12.640 --> 02:19.600
even looked at leaves ever again. I can't look at leaves. Take note, Ironton, Ohio. Full of spiders.

02:19.600 --> 02:24.160
Yeah. You're on watch. You're on notice from Griffin because of the spiders. For arachnids.

02:26.320 --> 02:33.280
I think the true celebration is the the arrival of the PSL in your closest SB. It's back. It's

02:33.280 --> 02:39.440
back. It's better. Griffin, can I tell you? Thicker than ever. Can I tell you guys? I hate

02:39.440 --> 02:47.440
to make this confession to you but I'm I for me in my heart in terms of fall beverage consumption

02:47.440 --> 02:54.000
it the PSL has been dethroned. What? But um it's been dethroned by the SCM. Yeah. I'm

02:54.560 --> 03:01.200
I'm way. A salted caramel macchiato. A salted caramel mocha. I'm way. I'm so close. Way way into it.

03:01.200 --> 03:07.920
Yeah. It's good but it can't beat that pumpkiny flavor. I love the pumpkin. It has probably a leg

03:07.920 --> 03:14.320
up on the PSL in one department and that is that the PSL really does get thicker every year. It is

03:14.320 --> 03:21.840
pretty much uh it's a it's a pumpkinish sludge. Yeah. You know what I mean? It's like a squash

03:21.840 --> 03:27.520
based triple thick milkshake. There's a half a pumpkin in every cup. I think that. It's bad.

03:27.520 --> 03:40.160
Part of the problem is that I'm 31 almost 32 and I am I can appreciate complex flavor combinations

03:40.160 --> 03:44.960
like salt in coffee and I think that you guys maybe aren't there yet. That's the new thing

03:44.960 --> 03:51.680
isn't it? Is salty. I can't eat. I can't like I ate a crunch bar the other day and it was covered

03:51.680 --> 03:57.680
in cardamom and I was like ah what come on whatever happened to the good old days where chocolate was

03:57.680 --> 04:02.880
chocolate and we didn't need to you know throw sea salt all over we didn't have to every every

04:02.880 --> 04:07.520
snickers bar comes with the comes with one of those pepper grinders and you just put coat it

04:07.520 --> 04:12.480
in some sort of strange spice get out of here with that good old days. Sometimes I feel sometimes I

04:12.480 --> 04:17.280
feel like the salted chocolate is like an emperor's new clothes kind of thing where they're just

04:17.280 --> 04:22.960
waiting for some child to be like hey you ruined chocolate hey you put salt on my chocolate sir

04:22.960 --> 04:28.240
yeah you're right it really is for I feel like it's for 20 and 30 somethings who are like I know

04:28.240 --> 04:35.200
it's salty chocolate can you believe it I'm eating it too. I'm really only one of the Hershey bar

04:36.080 --> 04:41.040
can I just get some fucking chocolate please. Yeah that is that is it is a testament I think to

04:41.040 --> 04:51.600
to where our society is at now that we can't even us indulging ourselves has become so unspectacular

04:52.560 --> 04:59.520
that we have to like we have to put a put irony into our into our desserts. Well it's like there

04:59.520 --> 05:05.120
must be slight amount of punishment it's like that idea when they put like the the like red pepper

05:05.120 --> 05:09.760
in in chocolate and you bite down and it's like oh and there's cayenne in it yeah like can I just

05:09.760 --> 05:14.720
get some fucking chocolate why do I have to punish myself and like oh I want to vomit thanks for the

05:14.720 --> 05:20.960
chocolate. I think they're like I think all the ad wizards were like uh seems like uh this this

05:20.960 --> 05:25.440
chocolate's pretty unhealthy can we get some sodium up in it like a bunch of it how much

05:25.440 --> 05:30.240
sodium can we get in this. So much you can feel it between your teeth great. So you've been listening

05:30.240 --> 05:39.040
to three Andy Rooney's talk about candy. Did we introduce ourselves? No. Okay I'm your oldest

05:39.040 --> 05:46.400
brother Justin Andy Rooney McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother Travis Andrew Rooney McElroy.

05:46.400 --> 05:53.440
I am Griffin McElroy lead singer of the band Rooney. I think it I think Andrew Rooney should

05:53.440 --> 06:00.720
have been the main villain in Bioshock. Is a man not entitled to the sweat of his own brow?

06:00.720 --> 06:10.880
No says the man. Would you kindly tell me why there's so many Japanese? Where Andrew Rooney?

06:10.880 --> 06:18.880
Where are there in Japan? Yeah it's where they are. I was I was I was in my private hydro bubble

06:18.880 --> 06:27.040
dome yesterday and I thought I'm kind of thirsty and I thought that's crazy Andrew you're you're

06:27.040 --> 06:35.040
underneath the water. Do you ever think things like that? No says the man in Washington. I don't.

06:37.600 --> 06:44.720
Oh man. Well this has been my brother my brother and me. Tune in next week. Tune in next week when

06:44.720 --> 06:49.680
we I don't know do probably pretty much that again just with different voices and hope you

06:49.680 --> 06:54.960
don't notice. No this is an advice show and we're going to turn some questions into wisdom right

06:54.960 --> 07:04.080
now. Here it comes. Oh here it goes. I have a slight problem. I talk way too much. Not because

07:04.080 --> 07:07.760
you guys hear how good my voice sounds this morning? Yeah really good. Let me try again.

07:09.120 --> 07:14.960
I have a slight problem. I talk way too much. Not because I'm insecure or socially awkward.

07:14.960 --> 07:20.160
I just hate the idea of silence in a conversation. I've noticed recently that it makes me seem

07:20.160 --> 07:25.840
stupid as a young college student who considers herself intelligent. I have a lot of interesting

07:25.840 --> 07:32.560
things to say but they come out sounding ridiculous when they are said after a long long rant. What are

07:32.560 --> 07:38.560
some ways I can make my gift of gab more meaningful and intelligent? That's from loquacious in the

07:38.560 --> 07:50.080
lone star state. I personally. Justin loves a good long awkward silence. I love to dip in there. He

07:50.080 --> 07:54.400
just likes to soak in it like a hot tub. He's one of those people that whenever there's even a brief

07:54.400 --> 07:59.680
silence in a conversation he will address it and say like oh it's you know that it's a good

07:59.680 --> 08:03.760
friendship when you can just sit there and be silent and it still feels just so so good.

08:03.760 --> 08:14.320
I said it was 1368 sir please pull up to the next window. I think that the way you can

08:14.320 --> 08:20.560
transmute your gift of gab into something that'll make you a hit with other people

08:21.760 --> 08:28.400
is instead of. I know you're joking when you talk about having a lot of interesting things to say

08:28.400 --> 08:37.840
and I'm sure you do but if you can turn that gift of gab into asking questions you know wanting to

08:37.840 --> 08:43.840
fill the conversation up with asking people about themselves or you know filling any spare silence

08:43.840 --> 08:48.400
with a question about the other person an invitation for them to talk about themselves

08:48.400 --> 08:55.520
you will you will be more well liked and people will want to spend more time with you. I was

08:55.520 --> 09:02.080
thinking yesterday about an old bit by Mitch Hedberg, Dear Department Hedberg and he said I

09:02.080 --> 09:08.480
don't have attention deficit disorder but I took Ritalin and I found that I just had an extra long

09:08.480 --> 09:15.760
attention span. I would tell people there's got to be more to that story and if you can be that

09:15.760 --> 09:22.480
kind of listener if you can use your use your gift of gab that way then people are always that is the

09:22.480 --> 09:29.760
ideal person to have in a conversation and like I know that I have dealt with this too like I

09:30.640 --> 09:36.800
tend to talk no I know and the important thing to keep in mind is that while you have many

09:36.800 --> 09:43.040
interesting things to say so do the people that you are oh do they for sure they really though

09:43.920 --> 09:48.480
well I mean if they've just finished a long long rant and pause for a brief second and you go

09:48.480 --> 09:53.760
oh there's marsupials and they have pouches and they're like mammals but then you know maybe

09:53.760 --> 09:58.800
just let them finish their idea and then be like man that was great and you said that it was

09:58.800 --> 10:04.320
actually your cousin the whole time and like make it about their story make it about what they've

10:04.320 --> 10:14.000
said the secret to human relations is that no one cares about what you are saying yep with very rare

10:14.000 --> 10:21.200
examples no one wants everyone's just waiting for their chance to treat you to the thing that

10:21.200 --> 10:26.320
happened to them because unless someone's delivering instructions like and even then

10:26.320 --> 10:34.000
even then it's like hit or miss back in the day like okay back before radio and tv you had to rely

10:34.000 --> 10:39.920
on humans for your entertainment you would say like you've got to hit come on you raconteur

10:39.920 --> 10:45.920
hit me up with a story to entertain me like now anytime that someone's talking is a time that you

10:45.920 --> 10:51.360
are not watching the x factor so like you don't need humans to entertain you anymore you need

10:51.360 --> 10:56.320
them to give you relevant pertinent important information and you'll also see this is one of

10:56.320 --> 11:01.360
my favorite phenomenon like you'll hit a word in your story and watch the person you're talking to

11:01.360 --> 11:05.520
something click in their mind that reminds them of a story they know and then it's literally like

11:05.520 --> 11:10.880
you're watching a fuse yeah count down until they stop listening to the thing that you're saying as

11:10.880 --> 11:16.960
they just fucking cock it in the chamber like wait for their chance wait for the tactical precision

11:16.960 --> 11:24.640
strike to enter like oh oh oh yeah yeah speaking of your dead brother uh did you have you seen

11:24.640 --> 11:31.840
the curious green the the green man benny green man what's the what's the picture by these plants

11:31.840 --> 11:37.840
timothy button timothy button you can always tell the uh the the when a person is doing this because

11:37.840 --> 11:43.280
when you see your when your story starts to divert from the point they were going to tie to it you

11:43.280 --> 11:48.560
can see them in physical anguish it's like you're it's like you're going around highway curves too

11:48.560 --> 11:53.520
fast what were you saying about tiny cars you said something about tiny cars hey do you remember 25

11:53.520 --> 11:58.960
minutes ago when you were talking about that other thing have you seen that new benjamin green man

11:58.960 --> 11:59.760
benjamin green man

12:04.400 --> 12:14.240
so if you can if you can start use your gift to the gift really is asking questions is a lot harder

12:14.240 --> 12:18.560
than talking i've i've found this as i've tried to ask more questions because a lot of times

12:18.560 --> 12:24.160
questions can open you up to some pretty awkward interactions uh sometimes the answers are not

12:24.160 --> 12:30.080
something you want to get back um but so so use your use your your speaking talents to try to

12:30.080 --> 12:34.560
figure out uh questions to ask other people also another thing to keep in mind when it comes to

12:34.560 --> 12:40.720
the conversations is there is not like a you don't have this like basket full of topics and

12:40.720 --> 12:44.880
you need to get your entire basket empty before the end of the conversation it's not super market

12:44.880 --> 12:51.440
sleep and reverse and so like you may have a bunch of things to say but if you have to pass by

12:51.440 --> 12:56.480
you know some topics of conversation it's gonna be all right the only reason i actually like talking

12:56.480 --> 13:02.240
to travis is because i'm always hoping he's gonna slip a dope metaphor in the combo like super market

13:02.240 --> 13:11.520
sleep and reverse super market sleep and reverse yeah are you guys on yahoo yes yep this yahoo is

13:11.520 --> 13:15.840
hidden by nicole b thompson thank you nicole it's by yahoo answers user gracie who asks

until the show he's a brown oldenburg gelding with four black legs oh and i'm a girl thank you

13:33.840 --> 13:40.560
smiley face emoticon where are you going that you need a horse costume uh it sounds like some sort

13:40.560 --> 13:48.240
of some sort of uh horse-based costume contest so like like like toddlers and tiaras for horses

13:48.240 --> 13:54.560
yeah right here's the thing you could make a dope centaur costume but you would have to cut off a

13:54.560 --> 14:00.480
significant portion of the horse and and i would i would call it a very important portion of the

14:00.480 --> 14:05.920
horse which is to say it's pretty much its head and everything all that part thinking portion yeah

14:05.920 --> 14:11.920

you dress him up like a person and dress yourself up like a horse a horse right and then you put

15:17.920 --> 15:24.960

top put some leaves in your hair with maybe some orange red or yellow glitter if you're allowed you

16:10.560 --> 16:14.240

16:36.080 --> 16:43.280
nature's greatest wonder my brother my brother means your source for references to obscure

16:43.280 --> 16:49.680

16:54.320 --> 17:00.720
uh 90s comedy you're gonna it's as hard as it is to find a halloween costume that you as a human

17:00.720 --> 17:05.840
being can wear and then have people notice the clever reference that you've made imagine doing

17:05.840 --> 17:12.320
that for a horse that horse has to be some sort of horse right now let me throw this out you know

17:12.320 --> 17:17.600
how they have those things uh like the costumes for dogs that just spit over their front two legs

17:17.600 --> 17:23.440
and then they have like arms yeah those are fun business suits and those are fun yeah i like those

17:23.440 --> 17:27.360
why don't we get like that like horse size so it fits over the horse's head and the horse's

17:27.360 --> 17:32.160
front two legs and then it's got like arms and it's like a horse businessman or like horse yoda

17:32.160 --> 17:37.120
man i just thought about running into that at a party and it gave me the shippers like a like a

17:37.120 --> 17:42.320
bipedal standing up person but with the horse's gigantic head do you guys ever think about how

17:42.320 --> 17:49.760
big horse's heads are and then just get scared apropos of nothing you could there i don't see why

17:49.760 --> 17:57.360
um i don't see why the the horse can't be dressed like something that people dress like i remember

17:58.160 --> 18:03.520
one time a costume that i thought was pretty good was i saw a guy dressed as judge lance edo

18:03.520 --> 18:08.320
from so you want to dress a horse like judge lance edo from the jay simpson trial i thought

18:08.320 --> 18:15.520
that was a pretty good costume so you could just dress the horse like what's something people dress

18:15.520 --> 18:23.200
up like now probably dog the bounty hunter uh-huh oh my god horse the dog the bounty hunter don't

18:23.200 --> 18:29.040
mind if i do what do you dress as a hunter and you dressed your horse is like a wall mounted like

18:29.040 --> 18:33.360
head on a like a like you had to put something around his neck so it looked like his head was

18:33.360 --> 18:39.920
mounted on a wall that's that's not macabre yeah yeah and you put the rest of them in a wall but

18:39.920 --> 18:45.280
then it's like pretty good put them in a box just stand still horse i don't know i think that i i

18:45.280 --> 18:50.080
think that that would be a pretty good make it somehow like a plaque out of cardboard and then

ds you guys feel like we've drenched all the meat off this bone oh christ yes let's do another

20:53.360 --> 21:00.240
thing okay so let me i need to take a moment then ask you something griffin you people ask us a lot

21:00.240 --> 21:05.600
they seem to notice that you guys end up talking about horses and ghosts a lot yeah and it's like

21:05.600 --> 21:10.480
yeah that's true and i think man i wonder how it happens and it just dawned on me that like

21:10.480 --> 21:15.680
you are the one who's continually introducing horses into the conversation we don't get any

21:15.680 --> 21:21.680
like listener submitted questions yeah like hey my brother my brother me horses if the three of us

21:21.680 --> 21:29.040
were sitting in a room travis and i would be talking about like life and sure love and growing

21:29.040 --> 21:35.760
and every few minutes griffin would like lean in and say yeah and like horses right let me uh let

21:35.760 --> 21:41.920
me hit you with this what uh do you remember the first time we talked about horses uh and i found

21:41.920 --> 21:48.560
that yahoo or someone found it but either way i claimed credit for it it was like i had i had

21:48.560 --> 21:56.640
staked my mining pick into the ground and just uh just a torrent of i guess horse blood shot into

21:56.640 --> 22:06.240
the sky shot into the sky and then i was like yahoo i'm rich i'm saying we have found red gold

22:06.240 --> 22:12.880
we have found a deep deep pocket of natural comedy gases and i am ashamed when it runs out

22:12.880 --> 22:20.880
we have to start fracking for horse questions yeah yeah honey might honey does this ice taste

22:20.880 --> 22:30.160
like horse blood to you this is strange anyway that's why also there of all the people in the

22:30.160 --> 22:34.560
world speaking out against horse blood fracking of all the people groups there are in the world

22:34.560 --> 22:44.640
to make fun of i feel like horse owner and horse enthusiasts um equestrianistas are uh the funniest

22:44.640 --> 22:54.000
and also it's the safest because none of them are listening to the show correct okay you can love

22:54.000 --> 23:01.760
your horse just don't just not as much as your kids and it's not as much as your kids or your

23:01.760 --> 23:07.120
family or your dreams it's important i know it's it's tempting because when you ride a horse it's

23:07.120 --> 23:12.000
like it lends you its wings i gotta go back and remember some of those bumper stickers

23:12.000 --> 23:18.560
has everybody on this podcast ridden a horse i have yes what was what did you like it uh i rode

23:18.560 --> 23:23.920
bear back because i was on a farm i was on it for about uh i'm gonna say nine and a half seconds

23:23.920 --> 23:29.120
before it bucked me off and i thought it broke both of my balls broke them in half

23:30.160 --> 23:33.840
it's the worst pain i've ever experienced down down there

23:33.840 --> 23:43.440
uh i when when i rode a horse it was at a place called bob's happy trails horse farm or something

23:43.440 --> 23:48.880
like that definitely was that the shawnee state park happy trails horse farm yes something like

23:48.880 --> 23:52.560
that yeah and shawnee state park did they call it happy trails horse farm because it's where the

23:52.560 --> 23:58.640
horses go so that kids can ride them before they are killed before they actually you actually ride

23:58.640 --> 24:05.920
them to the glue factory and drop them off and walk they say happy trails tiger i guess that's

24:05.920 --> 24:13.280
the name for a horse it i i'm sorry is ben's maybe it's under new management though because it's been

24:13.280 --> 24:20.720
a long time since i was there it's been 20 years but ben's happy trails horse camp i see but yeah

24:20.720 --> 24:24.880
the only time i ever rode a horse i just remember feeling it's really it's really it's a really

24:24.880 --> 24:30.560
the only time i ever rode a horse i just remember feeling it's rippling muscles and warm skin

24:30.560 --> 24:35.680
betwixt my thighs and then i stared deep into its classy eyeball and i grabbed this chinkle

24:35.680 --> 24:42.400
chinkle uh-huh and started praying to oh don't stop slower slower for me please the horse in my

24:42.400 --> 24:54.880
thought a little funny it was tender it was tender no don't back off of it now you might be listening

24:54.880 --> 25:04.880
um was it jtrh nbr or what was the deal just was it was it jtrj nbr or you guys know it was

25:05.680 --> 25:10.240
um we actually i don't think we talked about jtrh nbr on the show no you got to listen to

25:10.240 --> 25:14.560
the set dish if you want that yeah that nug if you want it that nug that choice

25:15.760 --> 25:22.640
justin tell us about your happy trail experience i wrote it i got a boner i don't i want to oh my

25:22.640 --> 25:27.360
god it's you can't be blamed for that because you're riding on just a mass of rippling muscles

25:27.360 --> 25:32.480
it's like it is simultaneously like riding a bunch of vaginas and also like a gun

25:32.480 --> 25:41.920
it's like riding a living cannon yeah yeah made out of vaginas that's what it's like a vagina cannon

25:41.920 --> 25:47.280
a vagina cannon justin tell me where the where the horse's pubes trimmed in like a tasteful

25:47.280 --> 25:54.080
line going to its penis why can't we just ride horses why do we have to fuck we don't have to

25:54.080 --> 25:58.320
i'm saying we don't have to we get you because god gave us domain over all the animals i'm still

25:58.320 --> 26:04.880
trying to figure out the title it seems like an abuse of our privilege then i'm still trying to

26:04.880 --> 26:10.160
figure out the name of the farm a happy trail is it but is like a wish thing happy trails horseman

26:10.160 --> 26:18.080
camp it's called happy trails because the horses are about to die and the trails are pretty happy

26:18.720 --> 26:26.000
i just want to say as funny as it seems like to make fun of a person who loves to have sex with

26:26.000 --> 26:35.200
horses there is it's america there's and it's earth and it's this reality there is somebody

26:35.200 --> 26:43.600
who falls into the cross in the venn diagram sliver who is of our show's listeners and people

26:43.600 --> 26:48.880
who like to have sex with horses and is not amused i would hope that that person has a good sense

26:48.880 --> 26:58.880
i don't know the line must be drawn here there is no i'll apologize to furries about my ill-advised

26:58.880 --> 27:04.480
ill-informed rants about furries i will apologize to jugglers or should i say juggler about the

27:04.480 --> 27:12.560
shit that we said about jugglers i am not gonna i am not gonna go so far as to apologize equestrophiles

27:12.560 --> 27:20.000
nope we we do not stand by our previous calls for violence against the furry community no

27:20.000 --> 27:26.000
that was a that was an ill-advised joke we love furries now a demo for jugglers and i totally

27:26.000 --> 27:30.720
support people who want to have sex with jugglers yeah if you want to have sex with a juggler go

27:30.720 --> 27:35.840
nuts uh that's between you and your god but uh yeah i think we can take a pretty bold stand

27:35.840 --> 27:41.840
against having such horses you know this might be a little uh little controversial but i just do

27:41.840 --> 27:47.920
not support horse fucking all right well well wait wait wait wait wait it's okay between horses

27:47.920 --> 27:52.720
let's that's how that's if if we were if there was no more horse fucking there wouldn't be more

27:52.720 --> 27:57.920
horses and that's at the end of the day that's what you have to keep in mind but yeah man man

27:57.920 --> 28:04.240
or woman i guess woman is all right if a horse wants to bury his powerful horse shaft into

28:04.240 --> 28:13.200
another horse's quivering waiting horse vagina yep i think that is i mean give me a sell tickets

28:13.200 --> 28:22.240
to that i don't know why you are going so fast with this i keep telling everyone slow down we

28:22.240 --> 28:27.520
have an hour you know what i mean that is more than enough time from there's no rush there's no

28:27.520 --> 28:34.160
need to rush this dance yeah yeah we're just in a this is i'm trying to rush straight to a gallop

28:34.720 --> 28:39.600
and you guys are you guys are more of a cantor um

28:42.960 --> 28:50.560
well that was half the show on one question let's move on horses moving on a few months ago i moved

28:50.560 --> 28:55.680
from ireland to michigan and almost everything has been great should i should i should have a

28:55.680 --> 29:00.720
brogue don't do it i should probably keep reading keep reading what do you think about my brogue

29:00.720 --> 29:06.480
should have a brogue no keep reading i think you gotta go bro he's talking about okay when american

29:06.480 --> 29:15.120
people meet me and hear my accent they always ask me to say stuff didn't they often you should have

29:15.120 --> 29:21.440
a stroke right there in the middle of the question how should i react okay so when american people

29:21.440 --> 29:26.960
meet him they hear the accent they always ask me to say stuff then they often do their best

29:28.960 --> 29:37.040
oh no oh golly what a kerfuffle uh how is my face red or should i say green irish

29:40.640 --> 29:45.200
how should i react to these requests should i be polite or should i tell them to go to hell

29:45.200 --> 29:51.520
that's from different in detroit you know what we talked about earlier about how everybody wants

29:51.520 --> 29:57.200
doesn't want people to talk you're in one of the rarest positions where people actually do want to

29:57.200 --> 30:03.200
hear you say stuff yes but my friend marianna mcgee who also co-hosts in case of emergency

30:03.200 --> 30:09.280
with me like every she's got a pretty noticeable australian accent every time that she goes out

30:09.280 --> 30:15.840
somewhere some douchebag he's like where are you from okay now say uh throw another shrimp on the

30:15.840 --> 30:22.720
barbie now say and it's like it's like turns them into like a sideshow act like a puppet it's the

30:22.720 --> 30:29.120
grossest thing and and the dude thinks that he's laying down mad game yeah like ah she she likes

30:29.120 --> 30:35.520
how cute i think it is she likes how xenophobic and narrow-minded i am she loves that shit i'm

30:35.520 --> 30:40.400
really gonna segregate her from the rest of the group yeah awesome can everybody just be like

30:40.400 --> 30:47.200
cool about accents yeah chill out i guarantee i bet i i've never traveled outside of this country

30:47.200 --> 30:52.000
because it's the greatest country on earth um but me i bet that you don't go to like england

30:52.000 --> 30:56.800
and someone goes oh my god what is that an american accent well no because your president

30:56.800 --> 31:02.640
and stuff our accent is the grossest but i also bet that no one over there like you don't roll up

31:02.640 --> 31:07.760
and someone's like oh what is that an irish accent weird no because they're they get that shit all

31:07.760 --> 31:11.440
the time because they're writing up next to it they get that's what i'm saying could we maybe

31:11.440 --> 31:16.160
just pretend like it's not the first foreign person you've ever met i think plus they they

31:16.160 --> 31:22.640
see it on tv and stuff a lot uh because all their tv shows are i think our accent to people

31:23.760 --> 31:30.560
on not on this continent or this continental mass i think i think it just sounds like every

31:30.560 --> 31:34.240
time we're talking like whenever we're talking it just sounds like pizza's just fallen out of our

31:34.240 --> 31:42.800
mouths i think it's a muddy i think it's a muddy sloppy sloppy diet dialect i don't think anybody

31:42.800 --> 31:47.760
likes listening to it maybe when these people are like demanding that you say stuff in your irish

31:47.760 --> 31:53.280
accent then you respond to them with what you imagine an american accent to sound like yeah

31:53.280 --> 31:57.600
and be like okay and that's my impression of you how do you feel we all best friends to like a

31:57.600 --> 32:02.000
british person we basically sound like the cockroach alien and human skin from the first

32:02.000 --> 32:12.320
men in black movie a lot of times when we have conversations like this in uh our international

32:12.320 --> 32:18.720
listeners take it as a cue to write in and kind of fill in some of the gaps uh in our in our

32:18.720 --> 32:23.840
international knowledge i just want to make it clear on this point specifically i i don't really

32:23.840 --> 32:29.280
care what you think our accents i like so please don't the only thing that i i really want you to

32:29.280 --> 32:41.040
do is take the sugar like that okay i remember you know what i can remember being um a young boy uh

32:41.040 --> 32:46.240
griffin won't remember this i don't think travis will either but i have a very clear memory i don't

32:46.240 --> 32:51.360
have a very clear memory of the first time i discovered i had an accent because i was like

32:51.360 --> 32:58.000
10 years old and i was at the beach um it was i think it was like an all-inclusive resort or

32:58.000 --> 33:02.160
something where people there were like a lot of activities planned for the kids so the kids would

33:02.800 --> 33:07.120
would do things separate from the parents and let the parents i don't know what parents do either

33:07.120 --> 33:15.600
by themselves watch tv or something uh so uh we were leaving for the day for the week and uh some

33:15.600 --> 33:22.720
of the kids i'd hung out with uh said oh we're gonna miss you justin we're uh we love your

33:22.720 --> 33:29.920
accent and i and it was literally like it was like the end it was like the end of usual sustrans

33:29.920 --> 33:37.760
like it's like guys are so say like wait a minute i do i have an accent i have an accent like for

33:37.760 --> 33:42.880
christmas like two or three years ago dad gave us like all of our home videos converted to dvd oh

33:42.880 --> 33:47.680
yeah and i sat down with teresa to like watch and was like honey come watch you know here's all my

33:47.680 --> 33:54.400
memories as a child and i had i had always known that like we had an accent but not until that

33:54.400 --> 33:59.600
moment was it thrown into so harsh reality as the video of justin and i playing on the jungle gym

33:59.600 --> 34:06.160
oh yeah and it's like hi father you motherfuckers you motherfuckers turned the word daddy into a

34:06.160 --> 34:15.680
four-syllable word you sounded like old prospectors thing if we weren't like three and six you would

34:15.680 --> 34:22.240
assume that we were doing like the worst comedy routine ever there are a lot of bad that if you

34:22.240 --> 34:29.520
watch this in malcolm gladwell's book the outliers he talks about how you need 10 000 hours of

34:29.520 --> 34:35.360
experience to become an expert in something uh i like to think now my brother my brother me is a

34:35.360 --> 34:40.800
show made by comedy experts but if you watch these because we've done hold on because we have done

34:40.800 --> 34:48.320
10 000 episodes go on no believe no but we've been trying to do bits for our whole lives if

34:48.320 --> 34:56.000
you watch these bit if you watch these tapes you could see a lot of half-formed comedy ideas and

34:56.000 --> 35:02.720
all of my jokes now make about as much sense as they did then there is an idea there is a uh there

35:02.720 --> 35:09.200
is a tape and then watching them now i just like i i oh it's hard to watch because i can see the

35:09.200 --> 35:15.360
setup and then the execution just falls flat i said there's one tape where travis is i'm gonna

35:15.360 --> 35:23.440
put him at four and travis says knock knock knock this one yeah knock knock dad says who's there

35:23.440 --> 35:32.560
here travis says knife yep that's his knife who and travis says would you rather work nightly or

35:32.560 --> 35:39.120
knifely yep what does it mean we'll never know what does that might as well be said in hieroglyphs

35:39.120 --> 35:44.640
but see if you had fucking done that if you had done that on a stage and just taken your bombing

35:44.640 --> 35:51.040
as hard as you would have it would have been like andy kaufman-esque like brilliant so you're saying

35:51.040 --> 35:57.200
four-year-old travis was just a comedic genius yeah we all griffin used to have griffin had a

35:57.200 --> 36:03.200
great bit when he was four or five the cheese no no i don't remember the cheese bit every time

36:03.200 --> 36:07.920
there was a camera pointed at griffin i would say cheese he would just go cheese and it didn't

36:07.920 --> 36:14.240
matter if it was a video camera or a regular if i was at a funeral or a pinhole camera i used to

36:14.240 --> 36:20.480
look at eclipses don't care uh no griffin had a pretty good bit where he used to come up to you

36:20.480 --> 36:28.160
say is there a baker under your bed and you would say no and then griff would say have you checked

36:29.360 --> 36:35.360
they would say no then griff would say then how do you know there is not a baker under your bed

36:35.360 --> 36:40.080
and you know some people was adorable and hilarious for me it was terrifying and i often

36:40.080 --> 36:44.080
lived in fear to fear because they were in bunk beds and griffin would hang his head down at four

36:44.080 --> 36:49.520
o'clock in the morning and shout this into travis's face i uh i have a confession that i need to get

36:49.520 --> 36:57.920
off my chest after okay probably 22 years okay oh wow i stole the baker under your bed joke from the

36:57.920 --> 37:07.200
movie rocket man i stole probably my most minute joke that whenever you talk about how funny a kid

37:07.200 --> 37:14.960
i was i stole that shit from harlen williams took it right from him are you telling me this

37:14.960 --> 37:22.640
yes i hate you took it right from you hate your fuck are you serious 10 years old you thought oh

37:22.640 --> 37:28.320
my god this kid's on another level nope you know who is on another level is harlen williams

37:30.240 --> 37:34.080
he while he's on another level for a 10 year old that's great because when i was seven i

37:34.080 --> 37:36.240
used to think that griffin was like a young harlen williams

37:36.240 --> 37:45.760
mm-hmm holy shit griffin yeah now i'm being usual suspects again now i know kaiser sozay too

37:46.960 --> 37:53.360
sozay again um i didn't uh sozay we all so say we all you have suspects those

38:57.280 --> 39:02.640

39:50.080 --> 39:57.360
box office success of rocket man that griffin has been cribbing this bit yeah and it never occurred

39:57.360 --> 40:03.280
to anyone i actually talked about that extensively on icoe and every time i've ever told anyone about

40:03.280 --> 40:08.480

40:08.480 --> 40:13.680

evening we had a big old barbecue with burgers and wings photos attached thank you uh and now

45:27.120 --> 45:34.320
we're watching the usual suspects and drinking beers whoa that's crazy inception but there's a

45:34.320 --> 45:42.480
problem for our post bbq suite we ended up buying a lemon meringue pie while delicious we are all

45:42.480 --> 45:49.680
agreed that the lmp is a far from testosterone inducing post-dinner treat we'd love to hear

45:49.680 --> 45:54.720
if you have a recommendation for a manlier dessert we presume as members of the volume

45:54.720 --> 46:01.280
loving american nation that you'll have a better idea than us sissy brits that's from effeteater

46:01.280 --> 46:10.560
in southeast london well you've come to the right place i'm fat might i suggest each of

46:10.560 --> 46:17.520
you eat your own cheesecake that's what no see that like that hoes into sex in the city territory

46:17.520 --> 46:22.480
for me everybody having their own individual cheesecake just for women that's what most of

46:22.480 --> 46:28.400
the series was about everybody just eat a pint of haagen-dazs yeah exactly that's that's the vibe

46:28.400 --> 46:35.760
of that why don't you four just jerk each other off what a sweet sweet dessert that'll be

46:35.760 --> 46:46.960
i don't understand that i think the obvious answer is deep fried things is that too is that too well

46:46.960 --> 46:52.800
i think well the obvious answer is to not assign goddamn genders to the dessert that you're eating

46:52.800 --> 47:01.840
you madman like why is this bothering you so much griffin because it's it's i think it's sexist to

47:01.840 --> 47:09.280
say this sweet light treat is a woman thing and these these hearty barbecue ribs are for dudes

47:09.280 --> 47:15.040
only bros only with these ribs now griffin that's that's wonderful that's beautiful and you're very

47:15.040 --> 47:21.360
open but have you never just like had a dude's night like yeah i i will have a night where i

47:21.360 --> 47:25.600
primarily hang out with my dude friends but we're not gonna eat like a key lime pie and be like oh

47:25.600 --> 47:36.800
what are we doing i man this is tough because i think that whether or not you i mean you can you

47:36.800 --> 47:41.040
can do this without assigning gender roles to it i mean you can just say that you're having sort of

47:41.040 --> 47:47.120
a a hearty a hearty night i will say that i don't think a lemon ring probably goes with barbecue

47:47.120 --> 47:51.600
yeah that's crazy if you want to talk about flavor pairings you're yeah that's not i don't

47:51.600 --> 47:57.120
think i i think if you're saying like this is a themed like outdoor cookery you know

47:57.920 --> 48:04.480
old school kind of dinner then yes lemon meringue probably does not fit the the theme god you know

48:04.480 --> 48:09.680
what i know that this is kind of a weird question but now i'm sitting here trying to think about it

48:09.680 --> 48:14.800
like a like you have all your guy friends over it's just boys night out you know and you're

48:14.800 --> 48:22.000
making some ribs and drinking some whiskey and i'm trying to envision a dessert you pull out that

48:22.000 --> 48:26.480
it's not like what are you doing well that's the thing that's why back in the day then bradberry

48:26.480 --> 48:31.040
and bob and i would have like a cookout day the dessert is more meat like you just eat meat you

48:31.040 --> 48:37.040
fall asleep on the couch there is no there is no like way to transition that conversation of yes

48:37.040 --> 48:42.480
good steak i like to eat it i've got something sweet i need something sweet on my teeth here's

48:42.480 --> 48:47.440
my suggestion because whenever i do a cookout party this is what i go with get some bananas

48:48.480 --> 48:54.560
all right slice them open without peeling them stuff some uh chocolate chips in there and wrap

48:54.560 --> 48:59.840
them back up in foil pop them on the grill for about 10 minutes is this a real thing you do pop

48:59.840 --> 49:05.920
it open either yeah it's delicious that's really good it is amazing and it's like grilled bananas

49:05.920 --> 49:10.560
you know stuffed with chocolate and it's badass because you're like eating it in foil and it's

49:10.560 --> 49:17.920
like fair food simple as shit still still shaped like a cock yeah i mean there is that i mean you

49:17.920 --> 49:23.680
can do the same thing with apples too corn apple soak it in like brandy and syrup whittle it whittle

49:23.680 --> 49:29.600
it into a cock shape and then put your dick in and put your dick inside the wrap it up in foil

49:29.600 --> 49:38.240
pop it on the pop it on the the grill for a while i wish there was a way of and maybe i don't know

49:38.240 --> 49:43.200
what the what you would call this aesthetic but i wish there was a way of separating what you

49:43.200 --> 49:52.240
would traditionally apply as the you know call the the dude you know pastiche the the steak

49:52.800 --> 49:59.120
the whiskey the jason statham movies what have you i wish there was a way of separating that from

49:59.120 --> 50:08.560
um just dudes yeah like like i understand this is an aesthetic and i think that women should be

50:08.560 --> 50:14.000
absolutely able to enjoy it too i just wish it didn't have like you're saying gender roles

50:14.000 --> 50:19.760
attached to it right like called like an evening of badassery yeah i i don't know you like you

50:19.760 --> 50:24.640
even like i don't know uh badass seems kind of presumptuous for eating steak and watching

50:24.640 --> 50:29.680
kevin spacey movies like just seems like i don't know hold on hold on hold the fucking phone

50:30.640 --> 50:38.800
yeah did you just give kevin spacey a carte blanche badass status i know i said it i said no

50:38.800 --> 50:46.000
travis did i'm saying it's kind of self-important for watching for what badass this describing

50:46.000 --> 50:51.280
yourself watching a kevin spacey well don't fuck what about don't fuck with spacey

50:51.280 --> 50:58.480
he he could fucking wreck you did you see him in american beauty he was getting jacked

50:59.920 --> 51:06.400
what if what if you called it just like an evening of male bondage okay now okay hold on uh

51:06.400 --> 51:11.440
we'll come back to that the first time i heard k-packs i assumed it was somebody's frat nickname

51:11.440 --> 51:17.440
from college a guy named kevin paxton and everybody called him k-packs k-packs

51:17.440 --> 51:26.080
k-packs hey man i hope griffin had said that one very well i love justin's self-editorializing

51:26.640 --> 51:31.360
it's just a note if hopefully we'll hear that written in red ink cut this i cut this that's

51:31.360 --> 51:38.080
totally funny travis uh male you've you've actually explicitly put the word male

51:38.800 --> 51:44.880
into the thing that i'm trying to execute like an evening of person bondage okay no what okay

51:44.880 --> 51:49.120
evening of bondage because like you're bonding together but you want to say bonding yeah it's

51:49.120 --> 51:53.280
not about it's not even about the bonding like i don't know i don't get down on the sense of

51:53.280 --> 51:59.280
fraternity so much as just a sense of like eating food that is bad for you even it's bad for you

51:59.280 --> 52:07.680
like eating some steak and having a martini and watching k-packs a good question but why can't

52:07.680 --> 52:12.080
you just say like we're having an evening we're doing stuff we're getting together it's important

52:12.080 --> 52:15.680
to let people know what they're coming like what they're coming into yeah you want to you want to

52:15.680 --> 52:22.160
establish the the the vibe what would you call it justin i don't know i'm saying i don't have a good

52:22.160 --> 52:26.880
answer i think we got to use a totally gender neutral word for like it has to be gender neutral

52:26.880 --> 52:36.240
like nachos and steak then what if we just called that like dump and it's like a very it's a we're

52:36.240 --> 52:40.640
taking a dump no no it doesn't have to be that it's just a word that sounds like the thing that

52:40.640 --> 52:51.760
it is it's dump night come on over for dumb and then if sunday sunday sunday um dump

52:54.160 --> 52:57.040
don't worry your fancy khakis we're taking a dump

52:59.040 --> 53:04.320
i'm gonna take that word back from the way that you did honestly the juvenile way that you guys

53:04.320 --> 53:12.640
are using it i just i'm gonna open a fancy chicago restaurant called dump does it have like three no

53:12.640 --> 53:23.360
it has one one you with an umlaut jump i just come on down to jump we got steak we got steer

53:23.360 --> 53:34.960

53:34.960 --> 53:43.120
choices we got all the freshest angus sticks and all the choices cuts from kpx a job

53:43.120 --> 53:54.080
oh i just wanted a word to describe manly that is it doesn't exclude people with vaginas that's

53:54.080 --> 54:00.080
what i'm saying i don't think that that's asking so much just what about jump but to be fair i mean

54:00.080 --> 54:04.560
to be fair this is not just dudes are not the only guys who do this because every so often the

54:04.560 --> 54:09.040
ladies here in cincinnati will have like a ladies night where like they do a clothing exchange every

54:09.040 --> 54:14.960
