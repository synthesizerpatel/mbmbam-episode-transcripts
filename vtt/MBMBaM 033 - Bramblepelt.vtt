00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.000 --> 00:11.000
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.000 --> 00:18.000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
What's up, you cool baby?

00:20.000 --> 00:30.000
If you change your mind, I'm the first in line. Honey, I'm still free, take a chance on me.

00:30.000 --> 00:40.000
If you need me, let me know, I'm gonna be around. If you got no place to go, when you're feeling down.

00:40.000 --> 00:45.000
If you're all alone, where the pretty birds have flown, it's me.

00:45.000 --> 00:53.000
If you change your mind, I'm the first in line. Honey, I'm still free, take a chance on me.

00:53.000 --> 01:15.000
If you change your mind, I'm the first in line. Honey, I'm still free, take a chance on me.

01:24.000 --> 01:33.000
And if you ask, then you are sure to know, it's beginning to look a lot like wisdom here on My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

01:33.000 --> 01:39.000
It's an advice show for the modern era. I am your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
I'm the middle brother, Travis McElroy.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
And it's your boy, Griffin.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
Hey, um, would you guys say that-

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
You asshole.

01:47.000 --> 01:51.000
Are we on that Christmas creep?

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
Holiday, we're on the holiday creep.

01:53.000 --> 01:58.000
Can I, am I the only one who thinks Christmas creep sounds like a hip hop dance move?

01:58.000 --> 02:03.000
That's like taking, like the Dougie, or the orange soda?

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
Yeah.

02:04.000 --> 02:08.000
That's, by the way, get on YouTube and search for the Kel Mitchell orange soda dance.

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
He's back, he's back, and he's invented an actual dance. I'm not making that up.

02:11.000 --> 02:15.000
Yeah, except by he's back, the video's from 2008.

02:15.000 --> 02:19.000
He's definitely on his way back. He started a slow climb.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
It's a slow-

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
It's a Christmas creep to the top.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
It is a Christmas creep.

02:23.000 --> 02:28.000
Can we write a, can we, is it too late to like capitalize on that? Can we write a song on the Christmas creep?

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
First you jingle your bells.

02:30.000 --> 02:34.000
I'm on that Christmas creep. I'm on that Christmas creep. I'm on that Christmas creep.

02:34.000 --> 02:40.000
As long as we can still, as long as we can still do my B-side of Hanukkah hustle.

02:40.000 --> 02:44.000
Do the hustle.

02:44.000 --> 02:48.000
First you jingle your bells, then you mistle your toes. There's gotta be something else.

02:48.000 --> 02:59.000
We'll finish, this is something that really should be saved for My Melody, My Melody and Me, our improvisational songwriting show.

02:59.000 --> 03:06.000
So let's get right into the questions. We take your questions into us through email, Gmail, Tree Mail.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
This first one comes to us from Gmail.

03:08.000 --> 03:13.000
I recently met a Canadian girl on Omegle, and I've begun an online relationship.

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
My friend told me there are no real girls on the internet.

03:16.000 --> 03:22.000
Is this true? If so, should I still pursue a relationship with someone who might be a dude?

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
Those are two completely different questions.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
Confused in Connecticut.

03:27.000 --> 03:35.000
First off, let's start with the obvious question. Are there real girls on the internet? The answer is of course no.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
Nope. Nope. Not a one.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
Also, there are no real girls in Canada.

03:39.000 --> 03:45.000
I was going to say in the world. I'm thinking we've all been duped.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
Oh my God.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
It's a pretty massive cover up.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
Is it all holograms?

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
It's pretty much 100% holograms.

03:52.000 --> 03:56.000
Hologals? Is that closer where we're at?

03:56.000 --> 04:04.000
This is a terrible situation you find yourself in because Omegle, for those who aren't familiar, is an anonymous chat service, right?

04:04.000 --> 04:12.000
That hooks you up with a random person with no verification of their age, sex, location, anything.

04:12.000 --> 04:23.000
That you could be at the butt of a really brutal, long-lasting, hilarious-to-everyone-but-you prank.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
The longest con.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
The longest of cons.

04:25.000 --> 04:31.000
They say love is the longest con. I think Omegle love is slightly longer than that.

04:31.000 --> 04:36.000
I'm going to straight up, I think it's time for a little tough love, my brother, my brother and me style.

04:36.000 --> 04:44.000
What kind of life are you living that you start an online relationship with someone on Omegle?

04:44.000 --> 04:53.000
I can literally think of no worse place to start any kind of relationship, professional, romantic or otherwise.

04:53.000 --> 05:00.000
That would be like saying, I met the nicest guy on Chatroulette. He was wanking his dong. It was awesome.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
He was what?

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
Wanking his dong.

05:02.000 --> 05:07.000
That's not a combination of those words. I know you're going for individually, but combined I don't think that's a...

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
I don't like that one bit.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
That's not a combination that works.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
I'm almost certain it is.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
You workshop it, take it out.

05:13.000 --> 05:17.000
Basically what you just said was he was masturbating his penis, which is redundant.

05:17.000 --> 05:26.000
Yeah, here's how we're going to turn this into a W.

05:26.000 --> 05:33.000
You're going to say you're going to meet up with this person and then you're going to say, listen, I'm too cool to meet someone I met on Omegle.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
Never talk to me again and then just like block them from your life.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
You'll feel good about it.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
They'll, who cares?

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
They're anonymous.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
You didn't know him before.

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
You can go back to not knowing him now and you just bail on this.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
You've got to pull the old eject and get out.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
Trust me on this.

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
You have a little to no investment in this.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
This is imaginary.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
This is not real.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
Unless.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
Unless.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
What if it is true love?

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
Shit.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
Fuck.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
You know how vulnerable I am to the possibility of true love, Griffin.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
I know.

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
And it can spring up in the weirdest of places.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
And make no mistake, this is the weirdest of places.

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
The literal weirdest place on the planet.

06:12.000 --> 06:18.000
I mean, maybe it's just two lonely souls because that's all that's on Omegle.

06:18.000 --> 06:24.000
And maybe they just found each other and just connected on some deep spiritual level.

06:24.000 --> 06:28.000
And if that's the case, then you don't need to be worried about whether or not it's a dude.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
I got it.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
But here's my counter argument to that.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
Okay.

06:33.000 --> 06:41.000
There is no possible way, like in my opinion, that you are meeting the honest to goodness person that they are on Omegle.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
Why not?

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
Because there's no way they go on and go, and I snore.

06:45.000 --> 06:49.000
And I also, like, there's no way because nobody does that.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
Well, nobody does that anyway in the world.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
Yeah.

06:52.000 --> 07:01.000
Well, no, but you get to know the person and like, you know, it's not like I met you, I've never seen your face, I've never spoken to you about anything that's, you know, real, and I love you.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
That's not how that works.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
I don't think that he's not saying let's get hitched.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
He's saying, should I pursue?

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
Okay.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
Okay.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
Okay.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
Here's what we do.

07:10.000 --> 07:15.000
We set this up in ways that increase the real world intimacy of this relationship.

07:15.000 --> 07:19.000
First, you're gonna call on the phone.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
Nice.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
Okay?

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
That's what we're doing.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
We're calling on the phone if we're pursuing this.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
Two, we are chatting on Skype.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
Nice.

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
And making sure no one's doing any ventriloquist nonsense.

07:29.000 --> 07:36.000
We gotta see the real Omegle freak right there and make sure that it is an acceptable situation.

07:36.000 --> 07:42.000
So you don't want to fall victim, you don't want to fall prey to a truth about cats and dogs style dupe.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
You want to know that the correct voice is coming out of the correct lady.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
Right.

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
I don't want a Janine Groffalo, Uma Thurman, Swaperoonie, okay?

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
Nice try, Janine.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
Nice try, Janine.

07:53.000 --> 08:00.000
And I think another concern here is, you know, that idea of, oh, it turned out to be a dude and we were sex chatting and whatnot.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
Don't do that.

08:01.000 --> 08:06.000
Like, you haven't met this person, you shouldn't be sex chatting or whatever it is you kids do.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
You may very well be.

08:08.000 --> 08:13.000
There's probably a blog somewhere that says, look at the freaky stuff I can get this guy to say on Omegle.

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
Oh my god, I read that blog.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
Yeah, yeah.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
It's that one.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
The really funny one.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
But anyway.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
I love that one.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
With the little illustrations.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
I love it.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
So hopefully that'll help.

08:25.000 --> 08:30.000
You just gotta, don't bail on it, but do, you want some real world connections here.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
You want phone calls.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
You want video chat.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
You want to really see this person.

08:34.000 --> 08:42.000
And because you can't build a relationship with chatting anymore until we can verify that this person is.

08:42.000 --> 08:50.000
And there's so much in like that intonation and in speech and in how your chemistry, if it's there, I say you gotta go phone.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
But you gotta be safe.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
Be safe, be smart.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
Don't meet them anywhere, ever.

08:55.000 --> 09:00.000
Because you have brewed up a murdered cocktail here that you do not want to be sipping on.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
It's anonymous.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
That's scary.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
A hundred percent of murders are anonymous.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
None of your friends have ever met her.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
So there's no identifying her later.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
That's scary.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
That's very scary.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
Okay.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
I feel like, I feel like we should move on.

09:16.000 --> 09:24.000
I have hooked up with one of my closest friends a couple of times and he tells me he enjoyed those times, but he wants to keep our hookups a secret from everyone.

09:24.000 --> 09:28.000
Why doesn't he want to tell anyone?

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
Because you're ugly.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
Whoa.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
I'm just kidding.

09:32.000 --> 09:36.000
You also might be annoying or crazy.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
Maybe you're terrible.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
Thanks for listening.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
Thanks for listening.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
We enjoy your patronage.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
No, no, no.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
It's that he doesn't want things to get weird.

09:45.000 --> 09:51.000
Like you've got a group of friends, two people hook up and it's a weird, it's going to be a weird scene.

09:51.000 --> 09:56.000
Also, there's another option that's not insulting to you.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
He might be terrible.

09:58.000 --> 10:02.000
He might be, you know, wheezing the juice.

10:02.000 --> 10:09.000
Why wouldn't you want everybody to know that you're dating someone or you're making love to someone less terrible than you?

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
Well, because he might be a sleazeball.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
And so he might be like, no, I really like you.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
I really like you, but don't tell anyone.

10:16.000 --> 10:19.000
You should just sleep with me and then not tell anyone.

10:19.000 --> 10:27.000
He's trying to get the proverbial sex milk without having a relationship cow.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
Is that what you're saying?

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
That's exactly what it is.

10:29.000 --> 10:32.000
No metaphors either.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
I can never drink milk again.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
Nope.

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
What you need to do is you need to confront him.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
You need to be like, why are you keeping this?

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
No, I'm not saying you need to tell everyone.

10:42.000 --> 10:45.000
You need to ask him why he wants to keep it a secret.

10:45.000 --> 10:49.000
You need to be like, so what's shaking Kevin Bacon?

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
Why aren't we, you know, letting everyone know?

10:52.000 --> 10:57.000
Yeah, well, OK, here's the thing that is very logical to me about this question.

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
He wants to keep our hookups a secret from everyone.

11:00.000 --> 11:05.000
OK, that's that's to me is a very logical like because it should be a secret.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
It is. You get that shit out.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
It's a secret.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
It's a secret you have in this day and age.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
That's a treasure.

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
Something that, you know, other people don't, that you can keep private.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
Oh, yeah.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
That's awesome.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
What a wonderful gift that is.

11:19.000 --> 11:24.000
But that's not even it's not just the beauty of secrets.

11:24.000 --> 11:32.000
It's if you if you get laid, if you get your bone on like don't walk down the street like got my bone on today.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
Got my bone on today.

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
Here's the name of the person that I did it with.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
You can't.

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
You don't do that because it's not Facebook.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
It's just not gentlemanly.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
It's not ladylike either.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
It's not what people do.

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
Like, I don't understand why why this person is upset.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
Do they want them to be like, hey, what's up?

11:49.000 --> 11:53.000
We fuck.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
Hey, do you hear about me and Jerry?

11:55.000 --> 11:58.000
We fuck.

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
It sounds like to me like there's crossed wires.

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
Like maybe you want more than he does.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
That's what this question is really about, isn't it?

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
Yeah.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
That's what this question is really about.

12:09.000 --> 12:14.000
You want to take it to the next level and he wants to keep it a secret, uncomplicated.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
Again, makes total sense.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
But if you I will warn you of this.

12:18.000 --> 12:30.000
You do need to ask him if if you're interested in a relationship, you need to ask because it sounds to me like you do care a little bit more than you're letting on.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
Yeah.

12:31.000 --> 12:36.000
And you can't let your heart get busted up hooking up with this guy continually if there's not going to be any relationship there.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
Can you agree with that Griffin?

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
Can you agree with that?

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
I wasn't listening.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
I have a Yahoo answer question.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
I was like in the middle of the wisdom.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
I got the real nugget of this and you're like moving on.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
Did you get it?

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
Sorry.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
What?

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
It's a busy day.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
I'm on that Christmas crawl.

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
I'm going to set you on fire.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
What do you think Travis?

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
Will you listen to me?

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
I have a good sequitur.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
Again, you're leaving.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
You're leaving.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
You're leaving this question.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
Do you feel like you've answered it or can you not say?

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
What if I just told that person to murder suicide?

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
Let it simmer.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
Professional advice.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
Just let it chill.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
Let it simmer.

13:13.000 --> 13:16.000
That's the opposite of what I just said.

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
I basically just took what you said.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
I'm just going to stay back here.

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
I boiled it down to a rich syrup.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
To the opposite.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
No.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
It's like you melted down the chocolate and made lava.

13:28.000 --> 13:31.000
There's no connection between the two ideas.

13:31.000 --> 13:37.000
This Yahoo answer was sent in by Patrick Toy.

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
The only advice show that makes you dumber.

13:40.000 --> 13:45.000
That makes you actually less equipped to deal with your situation.

13:45.000 --> 13:52.000
Yahoo answer's user OhNo asks, are females attracted to the penis just as males are attracted

13:52.000 --> 13:55.000
to female breasts and butt?

13:55.000 --> 13:59.000
When a man sees female boobs and butt, they go boing, lol, I am immature.

13:59.000 --> 14:06.000
Is it the same thing when a woman sees a male penis or are they like ew?

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
Yeah, it's like ew.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
No, no, no.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
It's lady bone zone.

14:10.000 --> 14:14.000
I can't believe that's a thing.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
I can't believe that's a thing, Travis.

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
I can't believe that a lady sees a boner and goes mm-hmm.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
Yes, please.

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
Oh no, not a boner.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
Just a penis.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
Just anywhere.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
A flaccid.

14:24.000 --> 14:27.000
Just a flaccid, dangly piece of something.

14:27.000 --> 14:31.000
I don't think the reaction could possibly be, oh yes.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
Oh yes.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
I think, I'm not a lady.

14:34.000 --> 14:40.000
If I had to guess, I would imagine the reaction as something more akin to, well, here we are.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
Well, we need those to make more life.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
Oh, you again.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
Ah, of course.

14:46.000 --> 14:52.000
I can barely look, like when I'm in a shower hanging brain, I can barely observe my own

14:52.000 --> 14:56.000
thing without getting a little sick.

14:56.000 --> 15:03.000
I can't see my own without a complicated network of mirrors and volunteers.

15:03.000 --> 15:07.000
I just have someone come in and describe it to me every day.

15:07.000 --> 15:12.000
I have Leonardo DiCaprio come in and sketch it.

15:12.000 --> 15:15.000
We have to be on a boat though or I can't finish.

15:15.000 --> 15:21.000
I wish that Morgan Freeman delivered my penis report, my daily penis briefing.

15:21.000 --> 15:25.000
I wish Morgan Freeman would give my penis the power to control the world around us.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
Yes.

15:26.000 --> 15:29.000
And teach me a valuable lesson in the process.

15:29.000 --> 15:32.000
I feel like we're dodging the question though.

15:32.000 --> 15:36.000
I think women's reaction is probably like when they're looking at a bunch of ingredients

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
before it's time to cook something.

15:38.000 --> 15:46.000
Everyone likes to eat cake, but there's nothing necessarily appetizing about eggs and flour

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
and stuff.

15:47.000 --> 15:50.000
I get what you're saying.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
What?

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
I get what you're saying.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.000
There's a logic to it, right?

15:53.000 --> 15:58.000
There is some logic to it, but in the context of the question, you're making it sound like

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
women are turned on by baking.

16:00.000 --> 16:03.000
Oh, of course, of course.

16:03.000 --> 16:08.000
The interesting thing about this question is of course that with men, men who are into

16:08.000 --> 16:11.000
large breasts, the larger they get, the better.

16:11.000 --> 16:16.000
With women, there's very definitely like a fall, like if you're charting interest.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
There's a bell chart.

16:17.000 --> 16:23.000
There's a bell chart of interest and it peaks and then it goes like, wow, it plummets pretty

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
quickly.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
I would imagine.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
Thank God for that.

16:26.000 --> 16:34.000
I think this question is illustrative of the fact that it's hard for guys to understand

16:34.000 --> 16:38.000
why women find guys attractive because we're gross.

16:38.000 --> 16:43.000
I assume women are attracted to the same thing on dudes that dudes are attracted to on women.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
Like girls look at butts, right?

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
Don't they?

16:46.000 --> 16:47.000
Personality?

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
Is that what you meant to say?

16:49.000 --> 16:54.000
Yeah, they look at personality and they're like, look at that nice shapely personality.

16:54.000 --> 17:05.000
If I'm being judged on my breasts and it just seems to be the situation that you are describing,

17:05.000 --> 17:12.000
that is not a part of my body I have ever worked on to improve, knowingly at least.

17:12.000 --> 17:16.000
I feel like we're in one of those moods where we're anti-helpful.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
We're making all these situations worse.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
So let's do another one.

17:19.000 --> 17:24.000
I'm an atheist and I haven't done don't feel like telling my family.

17:24.000 --> 17:28.000
How do I politely get out of going to Christmas mass without them asking too many questions?

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
Form spring.

17:29.000 --> 17:33.000
Wow, this is a good question.

17:33.000 --> 17:38.000
I have my answer, which is you go to Christmas mass because it ain't about you.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
It's about your family.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
Yeah, that's kind of true.

17:41.000 --> 17:44.000
Like you can I totally get I grok where you're coming from.

17:44.000 --> 17:47.000
Like I get the whole like you're not feeling it.

17:47.000 --> 17:51.000
So you you don't don't want to go.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
But it really is.

17:53.000 --> 17:58.000
It's like an hour and you're going for your family so they can feel like that togetherness.

17:58.000 --> 18:04.000
And also there's a lot to like even if you're an atheist, there's a lot to like in the ceremony,

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
the tradition.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
Sure.

18:06.000 --> 18:09.000
You know, there's there's usually some incense.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
That's nice.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.000
Chill.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
Some pretty music.

18:12.000 --> 18:15.000
I mean, there's nothing that says that an atheist can't go to can't go to church and

18:15.000 --> 18:20.000
you're not going to burst into flames as soon as you cross the threshold of the building.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.000
You're not voting either.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
Like it's not like I'm for it.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
I'm for what's happening.

18:24.000 --> 18:27.000
You're just there to in respect for your family.

18:27.000 --> 18:31.000
You would go to you would go to a church if a friend were getting married.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
I would think of this the same way.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.000
Yeah.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
Well, we really knocked that one out of the park.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
Finally, some actual help.

18:37.000 --> 18:41.000
Should we I think should we should we talk about our Christmas?

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
We're going to holiday.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
Our holiday.

18:43.000 --> 18:44.000
No, fuck that.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
You can't kill my Christmas.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.000
I'll take questions.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.000
I'll take Hanukkah queries.

18:47.000 --> 18:52.000
I'll be the Hanukkah query guy.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
So we're going to do a holiday.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
Can we call it?

18:54.000 --> 19:02.000
Can we call it ha ha ha ha ha like ha ha ha ha because we're going to we're going to make

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
it funny.

19:03.000 --> 19:06.000
Like I'm sure we'll have a wonderful name for it by the time it rolls around.

19:06.000 --> 19:10.000
But we're going to be doing that on Christmas, Hanukkah, Christmas, Hanukkah.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
Get it.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
If you have we're going to do all holiday questions.

19:13.000 --> 19:20.000
So if you have a if you've been waiting to get on the show and you have holiday questions

19:20.000 --> 19:28.000
and you want you want to ask them to us, make sure you get them to us by let's say the 17th

19:28.000 --> 19:31.000
of this month and and we will address those.

19:31.000 --> 19:36.000
I also like to hear about even if we don't end up using these, I'd like to have people

19:36.000 --> 19:39.500
write in about their traditions and ask us if they're weird or not.

19:39.500 --> 19:40.500
Oh, I like that.

19:40.500 --> 19:41.500
Yeah, I like that.

19:41.500 --> 19:43.880
It's sort of in the advice and advice realm.

19:43.880 --> 19:47.600
We usually ask that people don't ask about poop and masturbation.

19:47.600 --> 19:52.320
And I think for this, our holiday special, we can repeal that.

19:52.320 --> 19:55.200
No, I mean, we need the extra don't extra.

19:55.200 --> 19:56.200
Don't do it.

19:56.200 --> 19:57.200
Don't do not do it.

19:57.200 --> 20:02.360
I want this to be an episode where when you travel to your family's home, to the to your

20:02.360 --> 20:07.720
home's place, your ancestral home, you can say, here, let's gather around the fire and

20:07.720 --> 20:08.720
enjoy this together.

20:08.720 --> 20:09.720
I like that.

20:09.720 --> 20:13.280
And maybe when I edit the show, I can edit out all the curse words so that Jingle Bell

20:13.280 --> 20:15.980
sounds and then add in different curse words.

20:15.980 --> 20:21.000
So I can be like, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

20:21.000 --> 20:25.960
And all you'll hear is Jingle Bells and it'll make a song that you forget and it'll be like

20:25.960 --> 20:28.280
don't forget, sorry, grandpa.

20:28.280 --> 20:30.600
The best episode.

20:30.600 --> 20:34.240
So make sure you get those questions in.

20:34.240 --> 20:38.120
I currently have a boyfriend shaped hole in my life that I'm trying to fix.

20:38.120 --> 20:40.040
For pretty much my entire dating life.

20:40.040 --> 20:43.400
I've jumped from long term relationship to long term relationship with whatever best

20:43.400 --> 20:44.840
guy friend I had at the time.

20:44.840 --> 20:47.760
And consequently, I've never really dated or hooked up with anyone.

20:47.760 --> 20:48.760
I'm 20 right now.

20:48.760 --> 20:51.940
And I think the last time I was really single was when I was 14.

20:51.940 --> 20:55.720
My friends have been telling me I need to go crazy and get down with some random dudes,

20:55.720 --> 20:59.040
which sounds intriguing, but I miss the reliability of having a relationship.

20:59.040 --> 21:00.920
What should I do in BNB AM?

21:00.920 --> 21:03.880
Love always alone and indecisive Gmail.

21:03.880 --> 21:09.280
Oh, well, um, your friends sound like they give terrible advice.

21:09.280 --> 21:10.280
I don't trust your friends.

21:10.280 --> 21:11.280
Do they have a show?

21:11.280 --> 21:12.280
I didn't think so.

21:12.280 --> 21:13.280
No.

21:13.280 --> 21:17.800
Um, I don't think that that's the going crazy with a bunch of random dudes.

21:17.800 --> 21:24.000
I don't, I don't see that there's like, it's a big risk and you risk, I don't know, hurt

21:24.000 --> 21:26.680
somebody or get hurt yourself.

21:26.680 --> 21:27.980
It's never a good advice.

21:27.980 --> 21:32.360
And with stuff like that, I like to take it and try to apply it to different situations

21:32.360 --> 21:34.640
and being like, you know, I just lost my job.

21:34.640 --> 21:35.680
What should you do?

21:35.680 --> 21:38.280
Get a bunch of jobs and then quit them.

21:38.280 --> 21:42.160
That's not good advice for any situation.

21:42.160 --> 21:43.160
Like I just finished a diet.

21:43.160 --> 21:44.160
What should I do?

21:44.160 --> 21:45.160
Eat a bunch of food.

21:45.160 --> 21:48.800
Like, no, that's not a good advice to take for any situation.

21:48.800 --> 21:49.800
Yeah.

21:49.800 --> 21:52.880
I just don't, I don't think that that's a, have fun.

21:52.880 --> 21:53.880
Yeah.

21:53.880 --> 21:58.080
I don't look, but let's see, here's, here's the problem with this whole thing.

21:58.080 --> 22:05.240
People you can't give advice on how to proceed, like with your relationship in general.

22:05.240 --> 22:06.720
Like here's what you should do next.

22:06.720 --> 22:10.320
Here's the type of relationship you can pursue cause we don't control when these things happen.

22:10.320 --> 22:11.880
We don't control the type of people we meet.

22:11.880 --> 22:14.480
We don't control the type of relationship we get into.

22:14.480 --> 22:19.940
I mean, if it's the person that you, if it's somebody who can make you really happy, why

22:19.940 --> 22:22.540
would you just randomly bail out?

22:22.540 --> 22:26.440
The best advice I can give is to not try to do anything.

22:26.440 --> 22:29.760
Just live your life and you know what happens, happens.

22:29.760 --> 22:33.880
Don't set the mindset of I'm going to go out and get crazy and get down with a bunch of

22:33.880 --> 22:34.880
random dudes.

22:34.880 --> 22:39.080
No, because then you're trying to manipulate how that works and that's not a good way to

22:39.080 --> 22:40.080
go.

22:40.080 --> 22:43.600
Also, but you don't want to go out and say, I'm going to find true love because then you're

22:43.600 --> 22:45.840
trying to manipulate it the other way.

22:45.840 --> 22:48.120
Just be yourself, live your life.

22:48.120 --> 22:49.200
What happens, happens.

22:49.200 --> 22:50.600
We are saying this though.

22:50.600 --> 22:55.960
You're giving this person this advice because we have all done this thing where we get out

22:55.960 --> 23:00.580
of a long term relationship or at least I, God knows I have, like I got out of a long

23:00.580 --> 23:06.160
term relationship and then all of a sudden, you know, I, my eyes were opened and I, I

23:06.160 --> 23:11.080
went crazy as you said and I think that I got down with a bunch of random dudes, got

23:11.080 --> 23:14.160
down with just so many random dudes and I think the reason that three of us are saying

23:14.160 --> 23:18.200
it's a bad idea is because we did it and we know it's a bad idea and I think that may

23:18.200 --> 23:19.440
just be something you have to do.

23:19.440 --> 23:24.080
I think you may just have to have the, the bad idea part of your life.

23:24.080 --> 23:25.560
I think you need to have that.

23:25.560 --> 23:26.560
I think that's important.

23:26.560 --> 23:27.560
Well, okay.

23:27.560 --> 23:28.560
Well, let's compromise.

23:28.560 --> 23:33.000
If you do do that, that's fine, but don't set out to do that because your friends told

23:33.000 --> 23:34.000
you to.

23:34.000 --> 23:37.080
Like if that's what happens, that's cool.

23:37.080 --> 23:44.080
I think that that's a better, I think maybe a way to sort of, a way to sort of put this

23:44.080 --> 23:50.160
in perspective, something that will be applicable to you is be more cautious of entering into

23:50.160 --> 23:51.960
long-term relationships.

23:51.960 --> 23:57.080
Like rather than setting out to do that, give yourself permission to get out of relationships

23:57.080 --> 23:58.080
if they're not working.

23:58.080 --> 24:03.920
And I mean early, I mean like three dates, it's not working, bail and do go on dates.

24:03.920 --> 24:08.800
I think that that's something else that, that maybe your friends are getting around to.

24:08.800 --> 24:12.280
And maybe that, that's something that could work for you in a less harmful way.

24:12.280 --> 24:16.800
Don't just go with friends, you know, go on some actual dates with people.

24:16.800 --> 24:17.800
Yeah.

24:17.800 --> 24:18.800
In your twenties?

24:18.800 --> 24:19.800
Yeah.

24:19.800 --> 24:20.800
In your twenties?

24:20.800 --> 24:22.120
This is, this is when you, this is when you start dating.

24:22.120 --> 24:23.120
And I'm going to sound like an old man.

24:23.120 --> 24:24.120
If you have more mature dates.

24:24.120 --> 24:25.120
Yeah.

24:25.120 --> 24:26.120
You're, you're so young though.

24:26.120 --> 24:32.840
You have so much time, you know, just enjoy yourself and you know, go have fun responsibly.

24:32.840 --> 24:33.920
Yeah.

24:33.920 --> 24:36.520
Just go out there and just get your dick wet.

24:36.520 --> 24:37.520
Okay.

24:37.520 --> 24:38.520
Not.

24:38.520 --> 24:39.520
All right.

24:39.520 --> 24:40.520
Not quite.

24:40.520 --> 24:41.520
It's 2010.

24:41.520 --> 24:42.520
Okay.

24:42.520 --> 24:43.520
Women have dicks.

24:43.520 --> 24:44.520
What?

24:44.520 --> 24:45.520
Griffin, how about a Yahoo?

24:45.520 --> 24:46.520
Yeah, sure.

24:46.520 --> 24:53.040
God, I had so many good ones this week.

24:53.040 --> 24:54.760
Thank you everybody who sent them in.

24:54.760 --> 24:58.040
This one was sent in by Action Allen.

24:58.040 --> 25:08.600
It's by Yahoo Answers user Shane S. who asks, how to gel pubes and what styles are there?

25:08.600 --> 25:13.320
I am a guy and my boyfriend says he finds it sexy for my pubes to be gelled.

25:13.320 --> 25:16.000
Anyone know any styles for my pubes to be gelled?

25:16.000 --> 25:18.560
Give me a detailed process.

25:18.560 --> 25:19.560
Additional details.

25:19.560 --> 25:21.720
I use gel that I use for the hair on my head.

25:21.720 --> 25:22.720
Why?

25:22.720 --> 25:25.200
What happens if it's an alcohol product?

25:25.200 --> 25:26.600
I don't know about that.

25:26.600 --> 25:28.800
I would like some serious answers.

25:28.800 --> 25:31.240
Anyone know any styles for gelling pubes?

25:31.240 --> 25:32.460
I got a few.

25:32.460 --> 25:34.680
Is there anyone who gelled their pubes before?

25:34.680 --> 25:36.280
Preferably an answer from a guy.

25:36.280 --> 25:38.480
I'm going to have sex tonight.

25:38.480 --> 25:41.520
Please answer.

25:41.520 --> 25:45.920
I like the Gabe Kaplan which is a bunch of curly on top and then a row of straight right

25:45.920 --> 25:46.920
underneath it.

25:46.920 --> 25:47.920
I like that.

25:47.920 --> 25:49.440
I think that that's a real great look.

25:49.440 --> 25:52.320
And the current top too if you have time to dye it.

25:52.320 --> 25:56.700
I like the high top fade with some racing stripes in the side and your basketball number

25:56.700 --> 25:57.700
in the back.

25:57.700 --> 25:58.760
I like that.

25:58.760 --> 26:03.880
How about the Joni Loves Chachi which is where you basically you give your penis sideburns

26:03.880 --> 26:08.800
and then like a little pompadour up on top.

26:08.800 --> 26:09.800
All these are good.

26:09.800 --> 26:11.000
Also spray tan your penis.

26:11.000 --> 26:12.560
That's an important step for that one.

26:12.560 --> 26:13.560
Yeah.

26:13.560 --> 26:14.560
But just your penis.

26:14.560 --> 26:17.240
You could try the Twilight is very popular.

26:17.240 --> 26:22.240
That's where you put a bunch of glitter down there and when you hit the sunlight and I

26:22.240 --> 26:27.760
am assuming you're making love in the daytime it will sparkle and that's something that

26:27.760 --> 26:32.380
a lot of guys are really into.

26:32.380 --> 26:34.240
You can try the MC Hammer too.

26:34.240 --> 26:35.240
What's that about?

26:35.240 --> 26:40.080
Well the MC Hammer is where you have just three straight lines carved into the side

26:40.080 --> 26:49.720
and then directly below it you've sort of like two billowy legs of pubes that shimmy

26:49.720 --> 26:53.520
back and forth as you as you sway and jostle.

26:53.520 --> 26:55.720
So like a Fu Manchu.

26:55.720 --> 26:57.320
Oh the Fu Manchu is very different yeah.

26:57.320 --> 26:58.320
Out of pubes.

26:58.320 --> 26:59.320
Oh it is.

26:59.320 --> 27:01.400
So you basically make legs out of your pubic hair.

27:01.400 --> 27:02.400
Yeah hammer pants.

27:02.400 --> 27:04.320
You make hammer pants out of your pubic hair.

27:04.320 --> 27:11.320
You could also do the Uncle Jesse which is just a lovely bouffant of hair on top and

27:11.320 --> 27:15.360
then when you take off your pants just scream have mercy.

27:15.360 --> 27:23.720
Well you should be doing that anyway regardless of how you decide to style your downtown Maine

27:23.720 --> 27:28.680
it's important that you all have mercy every time you expose your penis to your partner.

27:28.680 --> 27:34.560
I like the young Einstein which involves electricity and patience.

27:34.560 --> 27:37.080
Oh Jesus.

27:37.080 --> 27:41.640
Looking for something low maintenance try the Sasquatch.

27:41.640 --> 27:42.940
That would that's let it go.

27:42.940 --> 27:47.800
Now we're getting off the subject because he obviously wants gel to be up in the mix

27:47.800 --> 27:50.920
and that's a very that's a very natural look the Sasquatch.

27:50.920 --> 27:55.120
There's at least three different Elvi you can do too by the way there's young Elvis

27:55.120 --> 28:02.520
there's fatter there's fat sparkly Elvis and then there's the Elvis Costello where you

28:02.520 --> 28:08.360
hot glue glasses upside down on your balls right.

28:08.360 --> 28:10.080
I like the gonzo.

28:10.080 --> 28:11.080
What's that?

28:11.080 --> 28:19.280
You just keep bending your penis till it forms a permanent nose and then you make Jesus Christ.

28:19.280 --> 28:21.880
Travis I'm sorry but that that doesn't have anything to do with hair.

28:21.880 --> 28:22.880
You're disqualified.

28:22.880 --> 28:26.360
Oh damn it.

28:26.360 --> 28:30.360
So I guess since Travis is disqualified the game is over and who won?

28:30.360 --> 28:31.360
All of us.

28:31.360 --> 28:32.360
And none of us.

28:32.360 --> 28:35.960
Except anyone who does any of the things we just said to do.

28:35.960 --> 28:36.960
They are the loser.

28:36.960 --> 28:40.680
I'm having some trouble staying awake at work.

28:40.680 --> 28:45.840
My job begins at 7 a.m. but I have to wake up at least 5 15 because I take a bus and

28:45.840 --> 28:47.400
a train to work.

28:47.400 --> 28:50.240
The bus and train trips are short enough that I cannot sleep on them.

28:50.240 --> 28:54.280
I usually go to sleep by 10 p.m. No drugs or coffee please.

28:54.280 --> 28:55.280
Help me in BNBA.

28:55.280 --> 28:56.280
You're my only.

28:56.280 --> 29:00.160
That's from Gabriel Gmail.

29:00.160 --> 29:01.160
Does he deserve?

29:01.160 --> 29:05.920
I mean if you're gonna shut us down like from the get by saying no drugs or coffee like

29:05.920 --> 29:10.880
do we even I don't think he deserves our if you're not gonna open your mind to the two

29:10.880 --> 29:20.200
best options because if you won't if you won't do drugs and you won't do coffee and I mean

29:20.200 --> 29:25.080
gotta carve out some nap time like you've got to get better at falling asleep on the train yeah

29:25.720 --> 29:30.040
well don't do that because you'll get fucking you'll wake up with your shirt you have to learn

29:30.040 --> 29:37.400
to hover right above that falling asleep point right before you pass out and so you like you

29:37.400 --> 29:44.440
get the rest but you don't miss your stop you're on that inception tip yeah that's exactly what it is

29:44.440 --> 29:52.280
um is it maybe he says no drugs or coffee do you think that it's a mutually exclusive thing if

29:52.280 --> 29:58.680
do you think if we suggested drugs and coffee oh that's cool um because i sometimes i'll take a

29:58.680 --> 30:06.840
few uh nice uh meth crystals uh none of that foggy shit just pure glass and i'll uh you know

30:06.840 --> 30:11.720
i'll crack that up and toss it in my folders instant mix uh and that'll usually keep me up

30:11.720 --> 30:19.720
for about three or four days until my teeth stop itching the the problem is is your job

30:19.720 --> 30:25.800
starts way too early and so by the time yeah by the time you hit like if you hit like noon

30:26.440 --> 30:32.280
you've only been to work for five hours but you've been up for seven and you only slept

30:32.280 --> 30:37.320
for seven the night before so like you're using up your sleepy time yeah you need a new career path

30:37.320 --> 30:43.400
but that's the thing is like he can take a nap after work but by that point it's too late he's

30:43.400 --> 30:50.280
tired at work it's bedtime the thing is you need to decide is it you need to have a lifestyle change

30:50.280 --> 30:55.240
uh you can either take naps like all the time which would just depress you uh you could change

30:55.240 --> 31:00.360
your career which you probably don't want to do because any job i've found starts at 7 a.m is

31:00.360 --> 31:04.520
usually something you had to work really hard to get in the first place um or you could just get

31:04.520 --> 31:11.160
down on that meth espresso like that's the easiest option is to just chug some espresso

31:11.160 --> 31:16.280
every morning except on the weekends um because if you do it if you do it every day you'll i mean

31:16.280 --> 31:20.600
you will die there and the good news is and i can tell you this from personal experience

31:20.600 --> 31:26.440
eventually your biological clock will balance out and you won't be sleepy at that point you'll

31:26.440 --> 31:31.880
be going to bed at like 8 30 at night but your body will get used to waking up at like 5 15

31:31.880 --> 31:37.800
now if you've been doing this already for like two years and you still can't stay up then i have bad

31:37.800 --> 31:43.880
news this isn't the job for you because your body's not gonna balance out it doesn't agree with you

31:43.880 --> 31:53.480
yeah what do you do at a party where you only know one person gmail leave leave leave leave

31:53.480 --> 31:59.800
immediately leave say this party is fun for everyone but me i'm out because that's worse than

31:59.800 --> 32:04.280
being at a party where you know zero people yeah at a party you know zero people you can go get

32:04.280 --> 32:09.640
really drunk and you know make some friends and do some crazy shit if you know just one person

32:09.640 --> 32:15.720
you're either just gonna hang around them and make a total boob out of yourself or uh you'll do the

32:15.720 --> 32:21.560
you'll get drunk and uh then the friend will tell all your other friends what a what a boob you were

32:21.560 --> 32:27.400
it's a lose lose this is lose this is one of those situations where if you're a really super outgoing

32:27.400 --> 32:33.720
person this is your chance to make friends if you're not this is not the time to try this is

32:33.720 --> 32:38.680
the time to go home yeah yeah you got the odds at least have to be in your favor you at least have

32:38.680 --> 32:44.280
to have a majority yeah and then meet new people that way but but this is not a good scene for you

32:44.280 --> 32:49.160
if you don't already know the answer to it then you shouldn't be in it i know i would be like

32:49.160 --> 32:59.080
if you didn't have if you if the ratio wasn't 75% people you know at a party you would you

32:59.080 --> 33:04.680
would take right off who's who's you just me yeah me i would do that well it this is a chance that

33:04.680 --> 33:09.000
you need to be preemptive in this and when your friend's like hey let's go to a party and when

33:09.000 --> 33:14.840
you're like who am i gonna know there and they're like me don't go to that party yeah i mean

33:14.840 --> 33:19.000
everybody does that right yeah that's totally totally within your rights don't beat yourself

33:19.000 --> 33:23.640
up about this yeah give them a break this is one of those things where you always kind of

33:23.640 --> 33:28.360
feel rude asking the question who's gonna be there but it's for situations like that that

33:28.360 --> 33:33.320
you ask it so it's important that you say like not that i don't want to hang out with you but

33:33.320 --> 33:38.520
if that's the case why don't we just go somewhere else we'll go see a movie and i don't want to go

33:38.520 --> 33:45.640
to a party where i don't know anyone sure dear sweet mbmb am my bf says he wants to change and

33:45.640 --> 33:50.040
is thinking of dying his hair blue and then he said or maybe i'll get a tattoo i think both

33:50.040 --> 33:55.400
ideas are terrible i don't keep him from doing anything silly but still satiate his need for

33:55.400 --> 34:01.000
change asked david from form spring encourage him to dye his hair blue verse get a tattoo because

34:01.000 --> 34:10.440
at least that's not permanent yeah um let me let me ask you this david i agree i i i i understand

34:10.440 --> 34:18.440
where you're coming from but why is it so important to you that they not do this like don't

34:18.440 --> 34:23.560
you love your bf the way he is because i would think that if it's somebody you really care about

34:23.560 --> 34:29.720
then you would want them to get get if they want to ink if that's important to them to to do that

34:29.720 --> 34:36.840
then then uh well let me let me counter argument that justin if he says or maybe i'll get a tattoo

34:36.840 --> 34:43.560
it doesn't really sound like it's a super passionate thing yeah that's true it sounds like

34:43.560 --> 34:50.120
your boyfriend is bored with something else maybe his job is boring or he's having family troubles

34:50.120 --> 34:56.280
or you know he's just been around his small town too much and so he's trying to you know uh strike

34:56.280 --> 35:01.720
out from other directions instead of dealing with the problem that he has so i think you need to talk

35:01.720 --> 35:06.280
to him be like hey what do you really want to change because i guarantee it's not your hair or a

35:06.280 --> 35:11.880
tattoo that's a good wow that was actually insightful travis thank you maybe you could take

35:11.880 --> 35:18.040
up a pipe and yeah that's the new jam right that's the new thing you are you getting in front of that

35:18.040 --> 35:22.360
is that going to be like a 2011 i'm gonna get i'm gonna get out there and say 2011 let's do pipes

35:22.360 --> 35:27.960
let's get pipes let's smell good that's a big change and it's healthy isn't it makes you look

35:27.960 --> 35:33.800
awesome and it makes you look so cool i well if you do it right yeah snooker one right now i love it

35:33.800 --> 35:40.120

what the fuck are you talking about aurora song like what are we doing

39:25.880 --> 39:34.040

39:34.040 --> 39:41.080
worlds yeah there are whole other things that that don't connect to us like we don't have any

39:41.080 --> 39:46.840
any um any vines into them reaching into them to give us some connection it's a it's a completely

39:46.840 --> 39:51.400
different planet that's just spinning wildly of its own accord some wild misconceptions about

39:51.400 --> 39:55.240
the furry community that i feel like we now understand and and totally accept into our

39:55.240 --> 40:03.160
hearts and collective minds but what the little song what i mean bramble pelt snowy pelt brambles

40:57.560 --> 41:02.440
listeners who know exactly like what this is like what a warrior are freaky listen you know they

41:02.440 --> 41:09.640
will there's one guy right now who's like brambly pretty good i knew i listed this show for some

41:09.640 --> 41:16.920
reason oh god oh god i have a friend who has recently started dating a new girl the only weird

41:16.920 --> 41:21.880
thing is that her best friend is a boy who is gay none of us in the group have a problem with her or

41:21.880 --> 41:27.320
her gay friend whatsoever the thing that is bothering us is the fact that our friend and her

41:27.320 --> 41:31.320
will sit in the living room and her gay friend will start to do weird things like rub her feet

41:31.320 --> 41:36.120
while they cuddle on the couch which makes us all ridiculously uncomfortable our friend has even

41:36.120 --> 41:41.240
told us that her gay friend snuggles with her in bed and when our friend is in bed at the same time

41:42.200 --> 41:48.200
yeah that would be weird if that's not how it worked out no no no this means it's gay friend

41:48.200 --> 41:56.440
girl her boyfriend okay yeah in the same oh my god yeah the real mind-boggling thing is that

41:56.440 --> 42:02.760
our friend doesn't think this is weird when it obviously is how do we possibly break the news

42:02.760 --> 42:06.840
to him that this is totally not normal without offending him and tell him his girlfriend is a

42:06.840 --> 42:13.160
weirdo for letting this continue confused in carolina wow what this is brutal what is the

42:13.160 --> 42:19.320
deal with your friend that he can't realize this is weird i need to let this wave of like sadness

42:19.320 --> 42:27.880
just wash over me and shake it i need to absorb this okay dust flower dust flower bramble snow uh

42:27.880 --> 42:31.080
i just want to be there for the moment when it's like don't mind me bro i'm just gonna be down here

42:31.080 --> 42:36.120
rubbing her feet you guys do what you were doing well first of all that's the that's the creepiest

42:36.120 --> 42:40.920
thing that two human beings can do to each other like regardless of their relationship status or

42:40.920 --> 42:46.440
gender just like hanging out with some buds don't mind me i'm just gonna rub her naked feet yeah is

42:46.440 --> 42:51.800
this cool is this cool i would rather see you french kiss i would rather see two people french

42:51.800 --> 43:00.280
kiss than two people oh especially if it's like a mutual foot rub i think there's a good chance

43:00.280 --> 43:06.520
that this friend of hers the gay friend is a serial killer yeah he could be a serial killer

43:06.520 --> 43:12.840
now it's sad okay so so here's the here's this here's the poop on your situation the the gay

43:12.840 --> 43:19.800
friend is obviously in need of intimacy now he he may be very well be like super duper gay

43:19.800 --> 43:25.560
that's fine but the problem is that we've talked we've talked about this before that

43:25.560 --> 43:32.280
just like if you're dating someone that that is like has a bunch of you know gay friends it does

43:32.280 --> 43:38.040
not give her or any of them carte blanche to make out at any time like yeah right that's still super

43:38.040 --> 43:42.440
fucked up like physical intimacy and and being attracted to somebody or two very different

43:42.440 --> 43:49.240
things and it's still somebody who's like being intimate with your with your friend and being

43:49.240 --> 43:55.720
intimate in front of you and i mean i mean intimate in like the the literal yeah way like if you're

43:55.720 --> 44:01.720
doing things you shouldn't do in public regardless and also psychologically the physical action

44:01.720 --> 44:08.120
creates the mental reaction so it's like you know making yourself sick thinking about vomiting makes

44:08.120 --> 44:13.240
you feel sick you know and being intimate with someone even if it's you know that kind of

44:13.240 --> 44:20.760
of skin-to-skin friend intimacy it's still creating a weird bond there it sounds like

44:20.760 --> 44:25.720
this girl is serving as like i don't know a security blanket for the gay friend where she's

44:25.720 --> 44:30.600
just like this outlet for intimacy or it's vice versa i mean oh yeah that's also very possible

44:30.600 --> 44:36.040
it's it's just fucked up like it's it's rude what's weird though is none of the three people

44:36.040 --> 44:41.720
in this situation like directly in the situation think it's weird the gay friend doesn't think

44:41.720 --> 44:44.680
it's weird the girlfriend doesn't think it's weird the boyfriend doesn't think it's weird

44:45.480 --> 44:51.960
so that's a good that's a good point i mean is it within her friend's right to to uh

44:53.880 --> 44:56.840
you know to to infringe on this and tell people how to live their lives

44:57.880 --> 45:04.920
yeah it seems like this would be someone else's call but you are totally within your rights to

45:04.920 --> 45:10.600
look at it and go man that's weird your job is to not hang out with them anymore because that's

45:10.600 --> 45:14.120
weird your job tell them that you're making they're making you uncomfortable i mean i don't

45:14.120 --> 45:19.320
hear anything wrong with that saying like hey i know you're like you're way gay like super duper

45:19.320 --> 45:24.120
gay but that you're still rubbing please stop touching feet yeah please thank you walk on those

45:24.120 --> 45:30.840
you walk over walking your feet live in your shoes like this is all this is all just topsy-turvy but

45:30.840 --> 45:35.080
see but no here's the one point where i'll disagree there it is not our listener the person

45:35.080 --> 45:39.880
who wrote the question and it's not your job to talk to the gay friend you get to talk to your

45:39.880 --> 45:44.920
friend and be like dude i'm not telling you to do anything i'm just telling you this creeps me out

45:44.920 --> 45:49.000
and i'm not gonna hang out with the three of you anymore yeah you're weirding me out yeah

45:49.640 --> 45:56.120
