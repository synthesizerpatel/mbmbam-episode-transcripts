00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:47.760
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother and my brother mean advice show for the modern era.

00:47.760 --> 00:52.000
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy. I'm your middlest brother Travis McElroy.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.200
Bienvenidos. I'm your littlest brother, baby brother Griffin McElroy.

00:55.200 --> 01:03.440
Limps. Limpos. Here's looking at you, Limpos. It's the talented Mr. Olympus.

01:03.440 --> 01:06.640
Give me those five rings. I'm gonna put them all on my fingers and show off my beautiful

01:06.640 --> 01:11.280
rings to my friends, Olympos. Just like Sonic the Hedgehog, we're after them rings.

01:11.280 --> 01:16.480
That's right. Americans and Chinese and other people are all on the hunt for those five rings.

01:16.480 --> 01:22.880
All of them. Americans, Chinese, France, and the other ones.

01:22.880 --> 01:26.160
Five rings of various colors have been hidden throughout Rio de Janeiro,

01:26.160 --> 01:31.840
and these proud Olympians must work together to follow the clues to find all the five rings.

01:31.840 --> 01:36.160
One of them you only find through geocaching. One of them you got to solve the mummy's tomb,

01:36.160 --> 01:41.840
I think. Just looking at the lineup of people looks like both big Australia and little Australia

01:41.840 --> 01:47.040
made it out to this one. Welcome to the Limpos, boys. I'm so excited to be here. I'm so happy.

01:47.040 --> 01:49.600
Now this is why we sports. This is it.

01:49.600 --> 01:53.520
But this year there is a team, and I thought that this was very profound,

01:54.400 --> 01:59.360
there is a team comprised entirely of people who thought Batman vs. Superman was, you know,

01:59.360 --> 02:04.880
not too bad. And it's strange that they have like a flag and everything. They're in the UN,

02:04.880 --> 02:07.920
and they're our strongest NATO ally. Yep.

02:08.960 --> 02:15.680
Do want to say just 18 hours after this year's Limpos began, I am very proud to announce that

02:15.680 --> 02:22.400
West Virginia, a West Virginian, won the state's first gold for this ceremony.

02:22.400 --> 02:24.000
Not just any West Virginian.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.400
Not just any West Virginian and not just any sport.

02:26.400 --> 02:30.720
What sport did West Virginia roll up and crush it in? You guessed it, shooting things.

02:32.400 --> 02:36.400
We took the golden gun, and her name is Virginia Thrasher,

02:36.400 --> 02:39.120
which is so fucking choice and money and good.

02:39.920 --> 02:43.920
Yeah, she actually goes by Jenny Thrasher. How fucking cool is that?

02:43.920 --> 02:50.320
Thank you to Jenny Thrasher for the inspiration, and this episode is dedicated to you.

02:50.320 --> 02:56.160
And it inspired me watching Jenny Thrasher get up there and just gun, like, and gun so tight.

02:56.160 --> 03:00.000
I decided that I'm going to take part in the 2020 Olympos.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.640
Oh man, me too. Griffin, I've actually been training already.

03:03.680 --> 03:04.960
What are you training in?

03:05.520 --> 03:09.600
I'm training in swimming, mostly the butterfly.

03:09.600 --> 03:14.160
Okay. I've been training with Michael Fred Phelps,

03:14.160 --> 03:18.800
who is Michael Phelps' dad, and who unfortunately shares a name with Fred Phelps.

03:19.520 --> 03:23.680
Yeah, that's too bad. So you swim and he's like, you could have done that a little bit faster.

03:23.680 --> 03:29.920
Also, I don't think that bisexual people should be able to vote.

03:29.920 --> 03:30.640
Yeah.

03:30.640 --> 03:32.400
Fred Phelps, why?

03:32.400 --> 03:36.080
If you swim better, God will kill people because he's ashamed of you.

03:36.080 --> 03:37.360
Oh, okay.

03:37.360 --> 03:42.240
I decided that I think I'm going to do leg wrestling.

03:43.360 --> 03:45.840
And I'm really excited to get there.

03:45.840 --> 03:48.640
No one's quite sure where the 2020 Olympics are going to be.

03:49.680 --> 03:54.160
A lot of people said, and I say that, and I'm looking at our producer now,

03:54.160 --> 03:56.480
and the producer is letting me know, just sort of emphatically,

03:56.480 --> 03:59.520
that a whole sort of panel got together and decided it would be in Tokyo.

03:59.520 --> 04:00.560
No, no, no.

04:00.560 --> 04:01.760
I'm still not sure.

04:01.760 --> 04:05.440
They say that, but at the last minute they're going to send out like Wonka-esque tickets

04:05.440 --> 04:10.960
to let you know where to go because they just don't want it swamped by like spectators and

04:10.960 --> 04:11.920
visitors.

04:11.920 --> 04:14.080
They just want to keep it pure for the sport.

04:14.720 --> 04:16.400
Now it is going to be in Tokyo.

04:16.400 --> 04:17.600
Apparently I'm getting it.

04:17.600 --> 04:18.800
They're just really emphatic.

04:18.800 --> 04:19.680
It's in Tokyo.

04:19.680 --> 04:23.520
And I would love to show everybody how I leg wrestle in the Japanese style.

04:23.520 --> 04:24.560
I'm looking forward to that.

04:24.560 --> 04:27.360
Yeah, I thought you were going to demonstrate it here on the call somehow.

04:28.560 --> 04:32.640
We're not even close to each other, but my leg is in the air right now and I'm flailing it.

04:32.640 --> 04:33.520
Justin, what sport?

04:33.520 --> 04:34.640
What sport?

04:34.640 --> 04:35.840
No Oddjob Goldeneye.

04:37.040 --> 04:37.680
Oh!

04:37.680 --> 04:41.600
I've been pushing for a long time and finally we got it in.

04:42.480 --> 04:46.400
They've had Goldeneye for a long time, but I think me and a lot of the other E-athletes,

04:46.400 --> 04:48.160
or E-athletes as we prefer,

04:48.160 --> 04:50.000
Or E-athletes!

04:50.000 --> 04:51.520
E-athletes!

04:51.520 --> 04:57.040
Prefer, like we thought it was unfair that whatever country got the first controller

04:57.040 --> 05:01.360
just like quickest on the draw got to be Oddjob and we just didn't think Oddjob should be in.

05:01.360 --> 05:08.240
So we protested and eventually we got, now the Olympics have no Oddjob Goldeneye,

05:08.240 --> 05:10.880
Oddjob Goldeneye and all slappers.

05:10.880 --> 05:14.240
Oh, is it all licensed to kill?

05:14.240 --> 05:15.440
Yeah, that's a good question.

05:15.440 --> 05:18.480
Yeah, obviously they don't want these matches to drone on for hours on end.

05:19.280 --> 05:23.120
But I'm really happy to represent my country and not choose Oddjob.

05:23.120 --> 05:25.760
You know, I have a secret strategy though that I've been working on.

05:25.760 --> 05:26.800
I wanted to share with you guys.

05:27.520 --> 05:28.160
Tell me now.

05:28.160 --> 05:30.880
Come in real close because I don't want the Ruskies to hear.

05:30.880 --> 05:31.520
Uh-huh.

05:31.520 --> 05:33.200
I'm going to choose Oddjob.

05:33.200 --> 05:34.080
Well now hold on.

05:36.640 --> 05:37.760
I've just changed my mind.

05:37.760 --> 05:40.960
Leg wrestling is out the window because it seems like it'd be very difficult and very taxing.

05:40.960 --> 05:43.920
And I'm looking at the list now and there's a lot of exciting new opportunities.

05:43.920 --> 05:46.000
I think I'm going to go with beach curling.

05:46.000 --> 05:46.640
Oh, okay.

05:46.640 --> 05:47.360
Oh, that's fun.

05:48.000 --> 05:48.960
It's a new curling.

05:48.960 --> 05:52.640
It takes place on the beach and the course is much shorter.

05:52.640 --> 05:54.640
I have actually switched mine now too.

05:54.640 --> 05:59.520
I'm going to switch my major and I'm going to start studying for slowest runner.

05:59.520 --> 06:02.240
And it's the last person across the finish line loses.

06:02.240 --> 06:04.240
These races can take months.

06:04.240 --> 06:05.120
They take a while.

06:05.120 --> 06:05.360
Yeah.

06:05.360 --> 06:06.800
Take a long time.

06:06.800 --> 06:10.640
The last person like missed their family really because that's how most people are just like,

06:10.640 --> 06:11.360
I want to go.

06:11.360 --> 06:12.480
I would love to go home.

06:13.120 --> 06:16.240
I'm actually going to be doing metal detecting this year.

06:16.240 --> 06:17.440
Changing it up again, huh?

06:17.440 --> 06:18.480
Yeah, it's nice.

06:18.480 --> 06:23.360
The really nice thing about it is you can walk into anybody else's event just midway through

06:23.920 --> 06:25.280
and just do your biz.

06:25.280 --> 06:25.840
You know what I mean?

06:25.840 --> 06:30.640
You could stop the beach volleyball midway through and just do the thing.

06:30.640 --> 06:32.640
I'm actually going to switch mine too.

06:32.640 --> 06:34.400
Oh, Travis is just going to switch his real quick.

06:34.400 --> 06:37.200
I'm going to switch mine to mystery barbecuing.

06:37.920 --> 06:38.640
Interesting.

06:39.680 --> 06:40.720
What does that entail?

06:40.720 --> 06:44.880
Well, you get the meat, but you don't know what the meat is ahead of time or even during sometimes.

06:44.880 --> 06:47.360
And you just serve it to the people and you have to prepare.

06:47.360 --> 06:51.760
Usually blindfolded and you're just given a strange meat that you have to cook and prepare.

06:52.800 --> 06:53.440
Hold on one second.

06:53.440 --> 06:56.400
I got to grab my phone.

06:56.400 --> 06:58.880
Hey, I need to cancel my application for beach curling.

06:58.880 --> 06:59.760
This is Griffin McElroy.

07:00.320 --> 07:01.760
Yeah, change that for me.

07:03.760 --> 07:05.920
Devil sticks, 100 meter.

07:07.520 --> 07:08.320
Devil sticks.

07:09.440 --> 07:10.960
Devil sticks, 100 meter.

07:11.520 --> 07:12.000
Okay, bye.

07:12.720 --> 07:14.640
I've changed mine again.

07:14.640 --> 07:16.480
I'm going to have to change mine one more time.

07:16.480 --> 07:17.920
Travis is just changing his real quick.

07:17.920 --> 07:20.000
I'm going to have to do head to head yo-yoing.

07:20.560 --> 07:20.800
Okay.

07:20.800 --> 07:23.360
Okay, a lot of tangled up strings in that one.

07:23.360 --> 07:25.200
And it can get bloody in there.

07:25.200 --> 07:28.480
A lot of black eyes, a lot of walked dogs.

07:29.040 --> 07:29.360
Yeah.

07:29.360 --> 07:31.600
It can get very violent in there.

07:31.600 --> 07:32.640
Sending an email real quick.

07:32.640 --> 07:39.840
Cancel devil sticks order application and change to fencing.

07:41.760 --> 07:42.240
Send.

07:42.240 --> 07:43.440
That's fencing with fans?

07:44.320 --> 07:45.280
With dance.

07:45.280 --> 07:47.680
You were close, but it was sort of a dance fencing.

07:47.680 --> 07:49.680
It's just sort of a fencing.

07:49.680 --> 07:50.240
Fencing?

07:50.240 --> 07:51.200
No, actually, I'm sorry.

07:51.200 --> 07:51.760
Changing that.

07:51.760 --> 07:54.160
Instead, I'd like to do fancing.

07:54.160 --> 07:56.560
And that's just where you get as fancy as you can get.

07:56.560 --> 07:58.960
And you just sort of, you have a contest with it.

08:00.400 --> 08:00.800
Okay.

08:00.800 --> 08:01.920
My pager's going off.

08:01.920 --> 08:03.920
Looking forward to taking the platinum home on that one.

08:03.920 --> 08:04.960
It's even better than gold.

08:04.960 --> 08:06.880
Nobody's ever gotten it before, but I will.

08:06.880 --> 08:08.000
My pager's going off.

08:08.000 --> 08:08.720
Hold on one second.

08:08.720 --> 08:09.680
Let me check it.

08:09.680 --> 08:09.920
Okay.

08:09.920 --> 08:11.360
It's a message to call phone number.

08:11.360 --> 08:11.840
Let me call.

08:13.040 --> 08:13.360
Okay.

08:13.360 --> 08:14.560
That was me from the future.

08:14.560 --> 08:19.760
I've been informed that I have changed my category in the future to freestyle bad boy.

08:21.360 --> 08:24.080
Leather jacket, pomade, sunglasses.

08:24.080 --> 08:26.080
Anything goes in freestyle bad boy.

08:27.360 --> 08:30.880
Yeah, it's an open field this year because I'm the only one participating.

08:30.880 --> 08:33.680
And I think I could have a good shot at least bronze.

08:33.680 --> 08:37.280
Oh, I'm going to send an email real quick just if I could.

08:37.280 --> 08:38.480
Let me just switch it.

08:38.480 --> 08:42.960
I'm going to switch to synchronized vests and just see.

08:42.960 --> 08:43.200
Yeah.

08:43.200 --> 08:44.400
Oh, there was an opening.

08:44.400 --> 08:46.640
I was able to get into the American team.

08:46.640 --> 08:47.360
This is great.

08:47.920 --> 08:48.720
Oh, shit.

08:48.720 --> 08:50.000
Hey, guys, hold on one second.

08:52.720 --> 08:56.320
Somebody's just thrown a rock through my window and it's, oh, it's me.

08:56.320 --> 08:58.160
And it's an application from myself.

08:58.160 --> 08:59.600
I'm changing categories too.

08:59.600 --> 09:00.640
Let me read here.

09:00.640 --> 09:01.840
Sorry, the notes really crumpled up.

09:01.840 --> 09:02.960
It's wrapped around a rock.

09:02.960 --> 09:04.640
It just says Richard Gear.

09:05.920 --> 09:09.680
So I'm going to, I guess I'm changing mine to Richard Gear.

09:10.880 --> 09:12.240
Oh, sorry.

09:12.240 --> 09:13.360
I just got a notification.

09:13.360 --> 09:18.640
They've actually changed synchronized vesting to world's nicest rap battler now.

09:18.640 --> 09:20.000
So we'll see how it goes.

09:20.000 --> 09:20.880
Like no cussing.

09:20.880 --> 09:22.160
And a lot of compliments.

09:22.160 --> 09:25.600
It's mostly just flattery, but in rhyming couplets.

09:25.600 --> 09:31.680
Okay, I just got a DM from Olympics and they say that they would prefer that I change

09:31.680 --> 09:36.400
my category this year to no scope surgery, real patients only.

09:36.400 --> 09:38.080
And it says XXX on it.

09:38.080 --> 09:41.760
So I'm not sure that's supposed to be kind of an edgy thing, but I am going to be doing

09:41.760 --> 09:44.560
surgery, untrained surgery, because you have to be an amateur.

09:45.280 --> 09:47.600
Surgery on real patients without a scope.

09:47.600 --> 09:48.400
No scope.

09:48.400 --> 09:50.160
An owl just landed in my window.

09:50.160 --> 09:53.520
It's letting me know that I've been signed up for world's best grandpa.

09:54.080 --> 09:54.800
I don't know.

09:54.800 --> 09:56.400
I don't even know what I do in that one.

09:56.960 --> 10:01.680
I just got a notification that I received the gold medal for owl impersonation for

10:01.680 --> 10:02.960
tricking Travis.

10:02.960 --> 10:03.280
What?

10:03.280 --> 10:05.120
He was an owl the whole time.

10:05.120 --> 10:05.600
Sorry, guys.

10:05.600 --> 10:07.680
They just threw another rock through the old window.

10:08.560 --> 10:09.360
It was already broken.

10:09.360 --> 10:10.480
I don't even know how they did that.

10:10.480 --> 10:13.680
But I just got a new category here that apparently I've just been somebody else.

10:13.680 --> 10:14.400
Sign me up for it.

10:14.400 --> 10:15.680
And it just says Olympics.

10:17.520 --> 10:19.760
Super, super, duper weird.

10:19.760 --> 10:25.040
I just got a text message that we have all won the gold medal for Olympics category choosing.

10:26.800 --> 10:30.800
And the anti-bronze for improv comedy.

10:30.800 --> 10:32.560
We've actually done so good.

10:32.560 --> 10:36.640
It's a sort of acid that you apply to bronze and it just sort of dissolves it.

10:36.640 --> 10:38.320
Yeah, all medals.

10:38.320 --> 10:43.600
Uh, one last fact that I wanted to share with everybody before we move on, uh, West Virginia

10:43.600 --> 10:45.040
is shooting domination.

10:45.600 --> 10:50.720
There are five people competing in the Olympics this year that are, uh, uh, West Virginia

10:50.720 --> 10:51.840
University graduates.

10:51.840 --> 10:53.520
Uh, yeah, yeah.

10:53.520 --> 10:55.440
David Johnson is the manager of the team.

10:55.440 --> 10:58.080
WVU, Jenny Thrasher, Nash.

10:58.080 --> 10:58.880
Here's the best.

10:58.880 --> 11:02.720
Nico Campionni and Petra Zublasing, both from Italy.

11:02.720 --> 11:04.240
Italy's like, hold the phone.

11:04.240 --> 11:07.360
I hear there's a state where people are shooting so right.

11:07.360 --> 11:09.040
We gotta get them.

11:09.040 --> 11:11.520
It's what we've always raised you to be little one.

11:11.520 --> 11:17.840
Ziva Divorce Act from Slovenia has been called home to shoot shit for her country.

11:18.400 --> 11:19.120
We got this.

11:20.080 --> 11:21.440
Um, should we do advice?

11:21.440 --> 11:21.760
Yeah.

11:21.760 --> 11:22.000
Good.

11:22.000 --> 11:27.360
Best of luck actually to all of our, um, athletes who are from West Virginia and are

11:27.360 --> 11:29.440
competing on USA teams only.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.200
USA, USA.

11:31.760 --> 11:35.600
Jenny Thrasher, I don't know if you're like, if you got plans now, if you're like on your

11:35.600 --> 11:39.280
way home or whatever, but if you want to dip into another event and just like check shit

11:39.280 --> 11:41.440
out, I ain't mad at you.

11:41.440 --> 11:41.840
Yep.

11:41.840 --> 11:42.800
Just keep winning.

11:42.800 --> 11:45.120
Just see, just wait till they stop you.

11:45.120 --> 11:48.400
And if you want to be on our podcast, like judo, let us know.

11:48.400 --> 11:49.760
You can be on our podcast, Jenny.

11:49.760 --> 11:51.280
That would be sweet.

11:51.280 --> 11:52.240
That'd be dope.

11:52.240 --> 11:54.080
Uh, so let's get into the advice.

11:54.080 --> 11:55.040
I'm ready if you're ready.

11:55.680 --> 11:56.560
Yes, let's do it.

11:56.560 --> 12:01.840
My friend's dog is extremely unsettling and disturbs me greatly every time I visit.

12:01.840 --> 12:04.000
He has a very human-esque eyes.

12:04.000 --> 12:08.560
You can see the whites that don't look like a dog's at all and don't reflect in the light.

12:09.120 --> 12:12.800
When I go to the bathroom at night, he's just sitting there waiting for me in the hallway

12:13.440 --> 12:16.640
and he will sit on the couch like a man and watch the TV.

12:17.360 --> 12:19.200
He was found in the precious.

12:19.200 --> 12:19.680
Oh, sorry.

12:19.680 --> 12:20.560
Not precious.

12:20.560 --> 12:21.360
The precious.

12:21.360 --> 12:22.880
Oh, precious owner.

12:22.880 --> 12:28.480
He was found in the previous owner, told my friend to keep him thus passing on the curse

12:28.480 --> 12:29.440
to top it all off.

12:29.440 --> 12:30.720
He has a human man name.

12:30.720 --> 12:35.520
Everyone loves my friend, tells him his dog's a human man in a dog's body, but he says he's

12:35.520 --> 12:37.040
quote, trying his best.

12:38.000 --> 12:38.800
Please help.

12:39.840 --> 12:42.400
That's from Spooky Snacks in South Philly.

12:42.400 --> 12:47.360
P.S. It sounds like I embellish this or even made it up for the goof, but please understand

12:47.360 --> 12:48.880
I'm living in constant fear.

12:51.280 --> 12:51.680
Okay.

12:51.680 --> 12:52.480
Point of order.

12:52.480 --> 12:57.440
You can't tell us that the dog has a human name and not give us the dog's name, please.

12:57.440 --> 12:58.480
What's the dog's name?

12:59.040 --> 12:59.600
Bert?

12:59.600 --> 13:01.440
Bert? Let's go with Bert.

13:01.440 --> 13:05.120
Bert is a dog's name, though, that a human used once and thought it was funny.

13:08.560 --> 13:09.360
Jason.

13:09.360 --> 13:10.240
How about Ethan?

13:11.040 --> 13:11.360
Okay.

13:11.360 --> 13:12.400
Ethan is excellent.

13:12.400 --> 13:14.560
Yeah, no dog has ever been named Ethan.

13:14.560 --> 13:15.360
Or Aiden.

13:15.360 --> 13:17.040
Can you imagine a dog named...

13:17.040 --> 13:17.840
Come here, Aiden.

13:18.720 --> 13:19.760
Roberto Bonini.

13:20.880 --> 13:21.760
Ethan is good.

13:21.760 --> 13:25.920
So yeah, there's a lot of elements at play here, but I think I pieced all the elements

13:25.920 --> 13:28.400
together in a beautiful puzzle.

13:28.400 --> 13:33.200
And have you seen the trailers for this movie, 9 Lives?

13:33.200 --> 13:33.760
Yes.

13:34.480 --> 13:40.240
With Jennifer Garner and Kevin Spacey as a cat, and I think that somebody casts like

13:40.240 --> 13:43.280
a wizardly spell on him to turn him into a cat.

13:43.280 --> 13:44.960
And I think the wizard was...

13:45.760 --> 13:49.200
Oh, it's the guy with the voice that everybody just loves.

13:49.200 --> 13:49.360
It's Walken.

13:49.360 --> 13:50.080
It's Christopher Walken.

13:50.080 --> 13:50.640
It's Walken.

13:50.640 --> 13:55.600
It's Christopher Walken, who I guess only appears in movies to teach dad's lessons with

13:55.600 --> 13:56.320
magic.

13:56.320 --> 14:01.920
Like, I refuse to believe this is not a spiritual successor to Click.

14:01.920 --> 14:03.760
Like, it has to be, right?

14:03.760 --> 14:04.880
It's called Meow.

14:06.400 --> 14:09.840
So in Meow, Kevin Spacey plays a cat, and I think he just loved it so much.

14:09.840 --> 14:11.840
And after they finished shooting, they're like, thanks, Kevin.

14:11.840 --> 14:17.040
This movie's going to suck ass, but we're going to make so much of that dumb kid money.

14:17.040 --> 14:18.240
And he's like, I know.

14:18.240 --> 14:19.040
I love it.

14:19.040 --> 14:21.680
Hey, let me ask you a question, Claire.

14:21.680 --> 14:27.360
Is there a real magic man that can turn me into some sort of bedeviled animal?

14:27.920 --> 14:34.320
And they said, geez, Kevin, with that accent constantly, yeah, I think we can hook you

14:34.320 --> 14:35.360
up with somebody.

14:35.360 --> 14:36.560
Bing, bang, boom.

14:36.560 --> 14:39.760
Long story short, we got a dog Kevin Spacey on our hands.

14:39.760 --> 14:41.040
True story, though.

14:42.080 --> 14:43.600
What is wrong with you, Kevin?

14:44.240 --> 14:45.040
Yeah, Kev.

14:45.040 --> 14:46.560
Kevin, do you have a second?

14:46.560 --> 14:53.280
Kevin, do you have a second? You went from House of Cards to Elvis and Nixon to 9 Lives.

14:53.280 --> 14:55.120
You're spinning out of control.

14:55.920 --> 14:57.840
You are an American beauty.

14:57.840 --> 15:02.560
Your latest film is currently in post-production and due out 2017.

15:02.560 --> 15:06.160
I know nothing about it, but it's literally called Baby Driver.

15:08.240 --> 15:14.080
Does the man who made K-Pax have something on you that's blackmailing you into these movies?

15:14.080 --> 15:16.160
Who would make you do this, Kevin?

15:16.160 --> 15:17.840
Maybe K-Pax was a true story.

15:17.840 --> 15:21.760
He's got a fucking alien brain up there and capable of making good decisions.

15:22.640 --> 15:24.480
It can't be the money, right?

15:24.480 --> 15:30.000
I'm just worried that maybe we're dealing with a Dave situation where Kevin Spacey is

15:30.000 --> 15:34.480
laying like in a sick bed somewhere and they hired an actor who looked like Kevin Spacey

15:34.480 --> 15:35.760
to play Kevin Spacey.

15:36.720 --> 15:40.240
Oh, I thought you meant meet Dave and you were talking about the similar decline that

15:40.240 --> 15:45.040
Eddie Murphy did when he threw himself down a well that had a sign in front of it that

15:45.040 --> 15:46.880
said the Pluto Nash hole.

15:46.880 --> 15:48.800
No, no, not his Nash hole.

15:48.800 --> 15:55.120
I mean, like the movie, Dave, where maybe Kevin Klein is pretending to be Kevin Spacey.

15:55.120 --> 15:56.160
That's fun.

15:56.160 --> 15:57.120
That's just good fun.

15:58.800 --> 16:01.040
You're Kevin Spacey, okay?

16:01.040 --> 16:01.360
Yeah.

16:01.360 --> 16:02.640
Okay, wait, give me a minute.

16:02.640 --> 16:02.960
Okay.

16:02.960 --> 16:03.600
I'm there.

16:03.600 --> 16:08.960
Someone slides across a piece of paper from your agent to you.

16:08.960 --> 16:11.040
Your agent slides a piece of paper to you.

16:11.040 --> 16:16.880
It reads, a stuffy businessman finds himself trapped inside the body of his family's cat.

16:16.880 --> 16:18.080
That's the log line.

16:18.720 --> 16:19.520
Where does the cat go?

16:19.520 --> 16:21.440
Does the cat control Kevin Spacey?

16:21.440 --> 16:28.240
What on earth did they tell Kevin Spacey to get him to agree to appear in this motion

16:28.240 --> 16:28.640
picture?

16:29.280 --> 16:29.600
Yeah.

16:29.600 --> 16:32.160
And we will give you a lot of money.

16:32.160 --> 16:35.280
Hey, Kevin, it's got, hey, you know Arrow?

16:36.080 --> 16:37.280
His brother's in it.

16:37.920 --> 16:38.160
What?

16:38.160 --> 16:43.440
I remember the first time I saw the trailer for Nine Lives starring Kevin Spacey.

16:44.560 --> 16:50.640
I saw how bad it looked and I actually reached my hand into the screen, like in persona.

16:50.640 --> 16:55.280
And I was able to get like my whole torso and head inside of the trailer.

16:55.280 --> 16:58.640
And I grabbed Jennifer Garner's hands and she was like, pull me out.

16:58.640 --> 16:59.680
You can save me.

16:59.680 --> 17:04.320
And I tried, but my hands were too slippery and greasy and I let her go and she fell back

17:04.320 --> 17:05.280
into the movie.

17:05.280 --> 17:07.440
But I almost got her out.

17:07.440 --> 17:13.280
The first time I saw the preview for Nine Lives, I said out loud to Teresa, I look forward

17:13.280 --> 17:15.680
to hearing the Flophouse episode about that movie.

17:16.640 --> 17:17.360
They already did it.

17:17.360 --> 17:18.800
It was called A Talking Cat.

17:18.800 --> 17:19.200
Anyway.

17:19.200 --> 17:20.320
You said that wrong, Griffin.

17:20.880 --> 17:22.240
A Talking Cat?

17:22.240 --> 17:22.640
Thank you.

17:23.920 --> 17:28.080
How about we just spent seven minutes just kind of doing fun riffs on Nine Lives.

17:29.040 --> 17:30.640
And I think just be cool.

17:30.640 --> 17:33.360
It's a dog and feed it some snacks and be good with it.

17:33.360 --> 17:37.040
And maybe don't do anything too embarrassing around it so that when it turns back into

17:37.040 --> 17:39.440
a human, it's not like, oh, I'm so happy to be human.

17:39.440 --> 17:42.720
Also, Derek like gets his balls out everywhere.

17:42.720 --> 17:42.960
Yeah.

17:43.440 --> 17:45.680
Also, you can set Kevin Spacey free.

17:45.680 --> 17:48.400
I haven't seen Nine Lives, but it definitely ends with them.

17:48.400 --> 17:52.400
If they can say their dad's name at the cat, then they transform back.

17:52.400 --> 17:58.480
So you just got to figure out kind of what actor that makes bad choices is the dog and

17:58.480 --> 18:00.720
just just yell a bunch of names at them.

18:00.720 --> 18:03.920
I mean, start with Kevin Spacey, for God's sakes.

18:03.920 --> 18:07.360
Do you guys want a Yahoo answer from the service?

18:07.360 --> 18:09.760
No, I just feel like I don't know if we help them or not.

18:10.560 --> 18:11.360
Oh, cool.

18:11.360 --> 18:12.480
Then we're on par.

18:12.480 --> 18:14.560
This one is sent in by Joel Azose.

18:15.120 --> 18:15.680
Thank you, Joel.

18:15.680 --> 18:18.000
It's by Yahoo Answers user anonymous.

18:19.440 --> 18:22.400
Column Chargo.

18:23.760 --> 18:30.640
Chargo asks, what's a cool catch phrase to say before you throw up?

18:30.640 --> 18:37.680
I've always wanted to say something cool before I vomit from drinking too much.

18:37.680 --> 18:38.720
Any suggestions?

18:42.800 --> 18:44.240
Before, not after?

18:45.600 --> 18:46.880
Yeah, no, it's got to be.

18:46.880 --> 18:49.760
Well, I think let's free ourselves up.

18:49.760 --> 18:52.960
Let's give ourselves a little bit more comedy rope and say it could be either one.

18:52.960 --> 18:55.760
But I think it's funny if you say it before to almost announce it.

18:56.960 --> 19:00.160
And you know, because everybody says something embarrassed when they throw up.

19:00.160 --> 19:02.160
Everybody has a post throw up catchphrase already.

19:03.040 --> 19:05.760
What if you like just before you throw up, you yell like,

19:05.760 --> 19:10.240
I have something to add or I'd like to interject something and then you throw up.

19:12.320 --> 19:13.280
That could be fun.

19:13.280 --> 19:18.480
It's especially good if you're getting really drunk at like an art exhibit or some kind of like

19:18.480 --> 19:24.240
poetry jam somewhere where people are having very like elitist conversations and you can

19:24.240 --> 19:26.800
walk up like, that's a very interesting point about Chaucer.

19:26.800 --> 19:30.320
I have something to add.

19:30.320 --> 19:32.320
I think that's a very interesting point about Chaucer.

19:32.320 --> 19:34.640
I have something to add is a really good catchphrase.

19:34.640 --> 19:36.400
Yeah, it's maybe a little bit wordy.

19:36.400 --> 19:37.440
You're going to rush through it.

19:37.440 --> 19:39.520
Like, you know, it's kind of like, oh, this is very funny.

19:43.440 --> 19:47.280
Definitely the longer build up you could have before the better.

19:47.280 --> 19:50.720
I think you should kind of give it like a bard-esque opening.

19:50.720 --> 19:57.040
Sort of like, excuse me, if I could ask everyone to attend the tale, noblemen,

19:57.040 --> 19:59.760
noble ladies, gather round and I shall delight your-

20:03.840 --> 20:06.000
I'm sorry, if I could have everyone's attention,

20:06.000 --> 20:08.080
you're probably wondering why I've called you all here today.

20:09.520 --> 20:10.880
You have no idea how long it's going to take.

20:10.880 --> 20:14.000
That's the thing about Yards is you never know how long it's going to take, right?

20:14.000 --> 20:22.080
So the inverse, it could also be like, I also have something interesting to add about Chaucer.

20:22.080 --> 20:22.880
Like, what are you doing?

20:28.480 --> 20:30.880
I think it's very embarrassing to do it.

20:31.520 --> 20:32.720
It's so embarrassing.

20:33.920 --> 20:36.720
It's basically like a bathroom thing.

20:37.840 --> 20:39.280
And I would never do that in front of a person.

20:39.280 --> 20:42.800
So I think the best thing to do is kind of couch it and just be like,

20:42.800 --> 20:44.800
what I'm about to do is going to be a prank.

20:46.720 --> 20:48.240
And so people are like, what the fuck?

20:48.240 --> 20:49.360
You'd be like, pranked you?

20:49.360 --> 20:54.880
Do you think after you peek and look everybody dead in the eye, just be like, just kidding?

20:55.600 --> 20:58.640
Oh, just before you vermit, you scream, check out these special effects.

20:59.440 --> 21:00.400
Yeah, and then you do it.

21:00.400 --> 21:03.520
And then while you're crying, because I cry every single time I throw up,

21:04.080 --> 21:07.920
I just look up everybody and I go, that was fake.

21:07.920 --> 21:14.320
That can be fun.

21:14.320 --> 21:17.680
What if your catchphrase is something like, don't eat the dip.

21:17.680 --> 21:19.040
And then you threw up.

21:19.040 --> 21:21.280
Yeah, but what if you made the dip?

21:21.280 --> 21:21.840
Oh, no.

21:22.640 --> 21:25.360
Well, oh, you make the dip every time and then you don't eat the dip.

21:25.360 --> 21:30.320
Because then that also plants into everyone's minds who have had the dip, like, oh, no.

21:31.120 --> 21:34.800
And so they all feel like they're like living on borrowed time.

21:34.800 --> 21:38.720
But then when they don't vomit, they're so relieved that they find a new lease on life.

21:39.440 --> 21:42.640
Maybe you could go with something like, I was really close to my grandpa.

21:42.640 --> 21:45.280
I used to spend a lot of summers in his cabin.

21:45.280 --> 21:47.680
And I'll never forget his final words to me.

21:47.680 --> 21:52.320
They were, because if you did it enough times, people would eventually be like,

21:52.320 --> 21:55.280
I wonder if that's, you guys think this will happen?

21:55.280 --> 21:56.560
That might happen.

21:56.560 --> 21:57.600
He's told that story a lot.

21:59.280 --> 22:03.760
What if we're being a little, these are all very good,

22:03.760 --> 22:06.000
but none of them are really catchphrases.

22:06.000 --> 22:07.040
That's true.

22:07.040 --> 22:14.800
A catchphrase is essentially, it establishes a Pavlovian response.

22:14.800 --> 22:18.960
We have to have something so concise and memetic that when you say it,

22:18.960 --> 22:21.280
people know what's going to happen next.

22:21.280 --> 22:25.840
So maybe just something like in a baby voice, just like, oh,

22:25.840 --> 22:28.480
and if you say it just like that at a party, people are like,

22:28.480 --> 22:29.520
oh, damn, where's Jerry?

22:29.520 --> 22:30.320
Get him outside.

22:30.320 --> 22:34.000
What about something a little bit more t-shirt like,

22:34.000 --> 22:36.960
bada bing, bada boom, give me some room, right?

22:37.840 --> 22:40.320
Still very, you're gonna, uh-oh, you cannot,

22:40.320 --> 22:43.200
yarts in the middle of, because the word itself sounds like a yart.

22:43.760 --> 22:46.080
That could, you'd be like, bada bing, bada boom.

22:46.080 --> 22:47.840
What if you just yell, Omar coming?

22:48.400 --> 22:52.400
Omar coming could be fun, but it's taken and used.

22:52.400 --> 22:53.680
Oh, not like this.

22:55.440 --> 22:56.720
80s kids will love this one.

22:56.720 --> 22:59.760
Um, uh, maybe right before you puke, you say,

22:59.760 --> 23:02.480
first find the orange flag, get some free Casio keyboard,

23:02.480 --> 23:03.680
and then just puke everywhere.

23:04.560 --> 23:06.640
Kind of give them, or maybe just if you want to get simple,

23:06.640 --> 23:09.280
just physical challenge, then puke everywhere.

23:09.280 --> 23:11.360
Yeah, because it is a physical challenge.

23:11.360 --> 23:12.880
It is a physical challenge.

23:12.880 --> 23:14.240
This hurts me more than it hurts you.

23:15.120 --> 23:17.360
What if you just yelled like, hold my arms back?

23:18.240 --> 23:20.960
Because it's confusing, because most of the time you would say hair,

23:20.960 --> 23:24.080
and it would leave people wondering what you usually do with your arms

23:24.080 --> 23:24.800
when you vomit.

23:24.800 --> 23:27.840
But sometimes my arms and back.

23:28.400 --> 23:29.200
That would be a good one.

23:31.360 --> 23:33.440
That puke you like is going to come back into style.

23:33.440 --> 23:35.200
Then just puke on everybody.

23:35.200 --> 23:38.080
And then after you puke, you just look at them and go, damn fine.

23:38.080 --> 23:39.440
And that's fun.

23:39.440 --> 23:40.160
That's fun.

23:40.160 --> 23:40.880
Kind of cultural.

23:40.880 --> 23:42.160
That's the thing that people don't do.

23:42.160 --> 23:45.920
The after, nobody ever, I don't think people celebrate

23:45.920 --> 23:49.680
the natural human bodily function of vomiting enough.

23:49.680 --> 23:50.080
Yeah.

23:50.080 --> 23:53.360
And I think that you could just like turn around and be like, what was that?

23:53.360 --> 23:54.320
Am I right?

23:54.320 --> 23:56.800
Or just turn around like 10 out of 10.

23:56.800 --> 24:00.880
Could you lean into what was that as though it's never happened to you before?

24:00.880 --> 24:04.320
Like you really didn't know that that was one of the holes where that thing happened.

24:04.320 --> 24:05.440
What could that have been?

24:06.320 --> 24:09.360
Oh, that's good because you can get the build up and the after of like,

24:09.360 --> 24:11.600
what is this feeling?

24:11.600 --> 24:13.520
It would be amazing if it could be a payoff.

24:13.520 --> 24:17.520
Like in every conversation you're in the party before,

24:17.520 --> 24:21.200
you find a way to work it around to the fact that you don't think vomiting exists.

24:21.200 --> 24:25.600
And then when you do, it's like, oh my God, my eyes have been opened.

24:25.600 --> 24:26.560
This is astounding.

24:26.560 --> 24:29.280
Chuck was claiming he vomited earlier.

24:29.280 --> 24:30.480
Fuck that guy.

24:30.480 --> 24:32.240
What is he, a Tex Avery cartoon?

24:32.240 --> 24:32.720
Come on.

24:33.360 --> 24:35.360
Here's what I think you do.

24:35.920 --> 24:39.040
Because if it's something that's happening to you because you party a little bit too hard,

24:39.040 --> 24:41.280
and I get very nauseous when I drink.

24:41.920 --> 24:45.040
I know it's like, I think if you know you're about to go somewhere

24:45.040 --> 24:47.040
where you're about to really party already,

24:47.040 --> 24:53.040
then you tuck a small key in between your gums and your cheek.

24:53.600 --> 24:55.840
And you put a little handcuff key in there.

24:55.840 --> 24:59.040
And then when you yards, you let the key come out of the mouth and you get it.

24:59.040 --> 25:00.880
And you hold it up and you say,

25:00.880 --> 25:02.080
oh, thank God I've got to go.

25:02.080 --> 25:03.440
And you run out of the house.

25:03.440 --> 25:04.160
Oh, that's good.

25:04.800 --> 25:08.080
What they don't know is you've eaten a bunch of handkerchiefs earlier.

25:08.080 --> 25:10.880
When you vomit, you just start pulling them out and then say, ta-da.

25:11.840 --> 25:15.520
You fish yourself out of your pocket.

25:15.520 --> 25:17.440
And you say, you pull out your ear and you go,

25:18.240 --> 25:19.200
Susan, I found it.

25:19.200 --> 25:19.760
I'm on my way.

25:21.920 --> 25:26.080
Or you throw up an engagement ring and then immediately get down on one knee to whoever

25:26.080 --> 25:26.480
you're next to.

25:26.480 --> 25:27.200
Just whoever.

25:27.920 --> 25:29.120
Whoever's closest.

25:29.840 --> 25:32.160
Because they're going to say no because you're a big vomit boy.

25:32.720 --> 25:37.440
But at least it looks like you staged an elaborate proposal and then you got shut down.

25:37.440 --> 25:39.360
So now you're going to get a little bit pity,

25:39.360 --> 25:41.840
not for the vomiting, but probably also for the vomiting.

25:41.840 --> 25:44.160
Okay, so you don't propose.

25:44.160 --> 25:47.600
Maybe you just get the ring and just like, oh, this is embarrassing.

25:47.600 --> 25:49.760
Okay, this was not supposed to go like this.

25:49.760 --> 25:53.760
I had a whole Bruno Mars song queued up and everything.

25:54.560 --> 25:56.640
Okay, this is embarrassing.

25:56.640 --> 26:00.800
Recently, my girlfriend was asked by her best friend to be her maid of honor at her upcoming

26:00.800 --> 26:01.440
wedding.

26:01.440 --> 26:05.600
She asked her by presenting my girlfriend with a bottle of wine that had a customized

26:05.600 --> 26:07.920
label printed on it that said, will you be my maid of honor?

26:08.560 --> 26:11.040
My girlfriend, of course, said yes, and life is good.

26:11.040 --> 26:15.280
However, my question is, should we drink the wine or are we supposed to leave the wine

26:15.280 --> 26:18.640
inside as some sort of artifact to commemorate this special occasion?

26:19.200 --> 26:22.000
Would it be even more rude not to drink it?

26:22.000 --> 26:25.040
And that's from Not Drunk Enough Yet in New Jersey.

26:25.920 --> 26:30.000
My in-laws threw me and some of Rachel's friends from St.

26:30.000 --> 26:34.880
Louis who went to visit and they threw us a surprise baby shower there and somebody

26:34.880 --> 26:39.520
brought little It's a Boy lollies and I was like, fuck yeah.

26:39.520 --> 26:41.360
I took one, unwrapped it, popped it right in my gob.

26:41.360 --> 26:42.640
Didn't even think twice.

26:42.640 --> 26:46.320
Didn't even think twice about how this would be a treasured little artifact.

26:46.320 --> 26:47.440
I just like, oh, cool.

26:48.800 --> 26:49.600
It's a blow pop.

26:51.120 --> 26:58.080
Considering you're a co-host of a podcast with a man who at the age of 12 ate his own

26:58.080 --> 27:02.960
It's a Boy cigar from his birth, his bubble gum cigar from his birth, then I think you're

27:02.960 --> 27:04.080
in fine company here.

27:04.080 --> 27:08.160
It's a genetic trait of, I guess just to define that trait, we're shitheads.

27:08.160 --> 27:09.920
Just shitheads who love gum.

27:09.920 --> 27:14.800
Judging from your tone and your username, it sounds like we're really talking about

27:14.800 --> 27:15.840
time frame here.

27:15.840 --> 27:18.240
It does not sound, it's gonna happen, right?

27:18.240 --> 27:19.840
Like they're gonna crack it open.

27:19.840 --> 27:23.360
And the problem is the longer you wait, the guiltier you'll feel.

27:23.360 --> 27:26.240
If you did it like the day you got it like, oh, that's nice, pop.

27:26.240 --> 27:26.960
Like, okay.

27:26.960 --> 27:31.120
But now you're building up momentum of not having opened it yet.

27:31.120 --> 27:36.000
So the moment when you open it will have to be this like, this is the moment, like here

27:36.000 --> 27:36.240
now.

27:36.240 --> 27:39.920
Also the longer you let it sit in there, the better it tastes.

27:39.920 --> 27:46.480
Well, I'm gonna bet that a lot of work went into the custom sweet awesome label.

27:47.200 --> 27:52.400
I doubt very much that they slapped that custom label on like a $300 bottle of wine.

27:53.120 --> 27:58.000
Yeah, it seems to me that if you get someone a bottle of wine that deserves to be celebrated,

27:58.000 --> 27:59.600
you probably don't cover up the label.

27:59.600 --> 28:06.800
I've won quite a few murder mysteries at Ravenswood Castle with the Shadow Stalkers group out

28:06.800 --> 28:07.040
there.

28:07.040 --> 28:11.600
And when they commemorate the victory, they give you a bottle of wine.

28:11.600 --> 28:12.400
I have several of these.

28:12.400 --> 28:17.520
And every time they give it to you, they say, now don't drink this wine because it's terrible.

28:17.520 --> 28:18.640
It's like, oh, that's good.

28:18.640 --> 28:19.680
That's good to know.

28:19.680 --> 28:21.280
It's technically cooking wine.

28:21.280 --> 28:22.880
It's basically, yeah.

28:22.880 --> 28:24.000
Do you like vinegar?

28:24.000 --> 28:27.360
Um, I think.

28:29.360 --> 28:30.320
I think you do.

28:30.320 --> 28:31.920
I do think you drink it though.

28:32.480 --> 28:35.680
Yeah, I think you gotta save the bottle.

28:35.680 --> 28:39.600
Maybe you could turn into like a vase or put some like colored sand.

28:39.600 --> 28:41.200
That's a good question though, Trav.

28:41.200 --> 28:44.960
Because you are opening up yourself up to a second question of like, what do I do with

28:44.960 --> 28:47.040
this empty bottle with a label on it?

28:48.800 --> 28:51.120
There's so many art projects you could do.

28:51.120 --> 28:51.600
Yeah, man.

28:51.600 --> 28:52.720
You make old sand art.

28:52.720 --> 28:55.520
You could turn into like a fun puppet or something.

28:55.520 --> 28:57.520
You could turn into action figure for the kids.

28:57.520 --> 29:00.880
Just put a little ping pong ball on the top and you draw a cool face on it.

29:00.880 --> 29:03.360
And you just like tape a gun onto it or something like that.

29:03.360 --> 29:05.200
And it's like an army man.

29:05.200 --> 29:08.640
If you're going to keep it as a souvenir, regardless, I think what you got to ask yourself

29:08.640 --> 29:10.080
is what looks nicer?

29:10.080 --> 29:12.560
Like a full bottle of wine or an empty bottle of wine?

29:12.560 --> 29:16.800
I think you could probably sleep a bit easier knowing that you have a full bottle of wine

29:16.800 --> 29:18.160
in the house at all times.

29:18.160 --> 29:20.000
Like don't tuck into it.

29:20.000 --> 29:21.360
Your emergency bottle?

29:21.360 --> 29:22.320
Yeah, exactly.

29:22.320 --> 29:24.880
It's better to know it's there and you don't have to use it.

29:24.880 --> 29:30.720
Well, and also, unless they're into like glass blowing, they didn't make the bottle.

29:30.720 --> 29:32.320
Like the label is what matters.

29:32.320 --> 29:34.640
And you could like steam that shit off there.

29:34.640 --> 29:37.920
Yeah, steam it off and make a little brooch out of it.

29:37.920 --> 29:40.720
Or slap that in like a wedding scrapbook.

29:42.000 --> 29:45.600
Slap it in a scrapbook, make it out and make it into a necklace or something.

29:45.600 --> 29:47.040
Do something fun with it.

29:47.040 --> 29:50.480
Put it on something you're never going to finish, like a bottle of vegetable oil.

29:50.480 --> 29:52.960
I've had the same one in my cupboard for like five years.

29:52.960 --> 29:54.160
Never been tempted to drink it.

29:54.160 --> 29:54.960
Not even once.

29:54.960 --> 29:56.560
I got an old bottle of vinaigrette.

29:56.560 --> 29:58.480
I could put that shit on, you know what I mean?

29:58.480 --> 29:59.120
No problem.

30:01.760 --> 30:06.320
Why didn't they just give you a big old can of vinegar?

30:06.320 --> 30:08.240
You just say, why would you do this to me?

30:08.240 --> 30:09.280
Why would you tempt me?

30:09.840 --> 30:13.200
You know this is my favorite fluid, is wine.

30:15.360 --> 30:17.600
Why wouldn't you put it on a big box of baking soda

30:17.600 --> 30:22.640
and just stick it in my fridge for the rest of my life?

30:22.640 --> 30:26.080
Why wouldn't you just etch it into like a tombstone if you wanted it to be forever?

30:27.920 --> 30:28.880
Here's a tombstone.

30:28.880 --> 30:30.080
Will you be my bridesmaid?

30:30.080 --> 30:30.480
Thank you.

30:31.440 --> 30:32.560
This is not a threat.

30:32.560 --> 30:34.000
That's all etched on this.

30:34.000 --> 30:35.600
Will you be my, this is a tombstone.

30:35.600 --> 30:36.640
Will you be my bridesmaid?

30:36.640 --> 30:37.680
This is not a threat.

30:37.680 --> 30:38.800
I love you so much.

30:38.800 --> 30:39.360
I love you.

30:40.400 --> 30:47.120
There are people living in untouched like rainforest villages

30:47.120 --> 30:51.600
that have not seen the slightest glimmer

30:51.600 --> 30:54.960
of what we consider to be modern civilization in their entire history

30:55.520 --> 30:58.560
who I think I would have more in common with

30:58.560 --> 31:02.800
than a person who would take the time to create a beautiful gift

31:02.800 --> 31:04.560
to ask someone to be their maid of honor.

31:06.160 --> 31:08.560
I just want to take my hat off

31:08.560 --> 31:10.640
because I don't know where you're finding the hours in the day.

31:10.640 --> 31:12.080
I would like a few of them,

31:12.080 --> 31:14.720
but that's a very thoughtful friend right there.

31:14.720 --> 31:16.080
I cannot fathom it.

31:16.080 --> 31:18.240
How would you do it, Justin?

31:18.240 --> 31:20.720
I just fucking ask if I remember to ask.

31:20.720 --> 31:22.000
Like if they show up and like,

31:22.000 --> 31:26.400
oh fuck, you, will you be my maid of honor?

31:26.400 --> 31:27.600
You're in charge now.

31:27.600 --> 31:28.400
You're in charge now.

31:28.400 --> 31:29.360
I can't do this no more.

31:30.560 --> 31:36.480
I, when I did it, I created a fancy label

31:36.480 --> 31:38.400
for different products

31:38.400 --> 31:41.600
that I knew the recipient would be so tempted by

31:42.160 --> 31:43.920
that they would have to tuck into them.

31:43.920 --> 31:47.360
Um, so Justin, what did I send you?

31:48.400 --> 31:49.120
I think it was a bag.

31:49.120 --> 31:51.680
I think it was like an unopened bag of Tastations.

31:51.680 --> 31:54.000
Yeah, an unopened vintage bag of Tastations.

31:54.000 --> 31:57.120
I bought on eBay and I had sealed it with the label

31:57.120 --> 32:00.240
that said you're my brother and I love you

32:00.240 --> 32:02.640
and will you please be involved in this special day?

32:02.640 --> 32:06.000
Please don't tear the label up to get to the Tastations event.

32:06.000 --> 32:07.840
And then I knew on my wedding day,

32:07.840 --> 32:09.280
I made you show me the bag.

32:09.280 --> 32:10.720
And it was, you were like, what bag?

32:10.720 --> 32:11.440
What Tastations?

32:11.440 --> 32:12.160
What bag?

32:12.160 --> 32:13.440
I ate the bag.

32:13.440 --> 32:16.560
You sent me a can of pizza-licious Pringles

32:16.560 --> 32:19.440
that you had actually just masking taped the lid down

32:19.440 --> 32:22.000
but had written on the masking tape,

32:22.000 --> 32:24.320
will you be in my wedding party?

32:24.320 --> 32:25.520
Don't break this seal.

32:25.520 --> 32:27.040
Don't open, don't pop, don't stop.

32:27.040 --> 32:28.160
Do stop, don't pop.

32:28.160 --> 32:29.760
And that's why I didn't show up at your wedding.

32:30.480 --> 32:31.200
That's exactly right.

32:31.200 --> 32:34.160
I felt so guilty because I popped and I didn't stop.

32:34.160 --> 32:35.600
Travis didn't show up because he didn't even realize

32:35.600 --> 32:36.320
it was an invitation.

32:36.320 --> 32:38.880
That's how quickly he ripped into those bad boys.

32:38.880 --> 32:40.720
I just consimmed it like a cartoon character.

32:40.720 --> 32:42.000
I put the whole can in my mouth

32:42.000 --> 32:43.920
and then pulled that empty can back out.

32:45.120 --> 32:50.400
For Evan, I just put the label over an Al Jarreau CD.

32:53.200 --> 32:54.480
All of you failed me.

32:54.480 --> 32:55.200
A rare one.

32:55.760 --> 32:57.040
Should we go to the Money Zone?

32:57.040 --> 32:57.920
We're already there.

32:57.920 --> 32:58.400
Look around.

32:58.400 --> 32:59.200
Away we go.

32:59.200 --> 33:13.040
My Brother, My Brother, Me is supported in part by Casper,

33:13.040 --> 33:16.560
an online retailer of premium obsessively engineered

33:16.560 --> 33:19.440
mattresses for a fraction of the price

33:19.440 --> 33:21.120
that you're going to pay in a store.

33:21.680 --> 33:23.040
Travis, you sleep on a Casper.

33:23.040 --> 33:23.920
How's it going?

33:23.920 --> 33:24.480
It's going so good.

33:24.480 --> 33:25.920
Because Casper sent us an email like,

33:25.920 --> 33:27.440
who wants to try out a Casper?

33:27.440 --> 33:28.480
And Travis is like, me.

33:28.480 --> 33:29.120
I do.

33:29.120 --> 33:30.480
I want it up bed.

33:30.480 --> 33:32.160
I'm actually eyeballing it right now,

33:32.160 --> 33:34.400
waiting for the time when this stupid show is done

33:34.400 --> 33:35.360
so I can take a nap.

33:36.000 --> 33:37.520
And it's going to be so good.

33:37.520 --> 33:39.520
Like, listen, it's good for night sleeping,

33:39.520 --> 33:41.600
but it's so good for day sleeping.

33:41.600 --> 33:44.080
It's the best nap dress I've ever had.

33:45.520 --> 33:46.320
What's so good about it?

33:47.120 --> 33:48.080
It's great.

33:48.080 --> 33:48.960
It's like a cloud.

33:49.920 --> 33:52.160
You know, I've slept on mattresses before

33:52.160 --> 33:54.640
that had like really uncomfortable springs in it

33:54.640 --> 33:56.960
and, you know, just couldn't seem to find a balance

33:56.960 --> 33:59.360
between like too soft and too firm.

34:00.000 --> 34:02.800
And it just, all in all, like every mattress seemed like

34:02.800 --> 34:05.280
it was just trying too hard to win my favor.

34:05.280 --> 34:06.960
And Casper is not trying too hard.

34:06.960 --> 34:07.840
It just is.

34:07.840 --> 34:08.400
You know what I mean?

34:08.400 --> 34:11.280
It's just, it's so confident in itself.

34:11.280 --> 34:13.280
It's not trying to be what I want it to be.

34:13.280 --> 34:14.720
It's just being what it is.

34:14.720 --> 34:16.560
What I like about Casper, and I'll say it

34:16.560 --> 34:18.240
because it's taken too long.

34:18.240 --> 34:20.080
It has a risk-free trial and return policy.

34:20.080 --> 34:21.680
You can sleep on it for a hundo days.

34:21.680 --> 34:22.800
That's 100.

34:22.800 --> 34:24.800
And they give free delivery to the US and Canada.

34:24.800 --> 34:25.760
They have painless returns.

34:25.760 --> 34:26.320
You don't like it?

34:26.320 --> 34:27.440
You just send it right back.

34:27.440 --> 34:28.960
And all the mattresses are made in America,

34:28.960 --> 34:30.240
and that's what I really like about it.

34:31.440 --> 34:32.800
Yeah, they're really great.

34:32.800 --> 34:34.800
How can people get their hands on one of these Trisses?

34:35.520 --> 34:38.160
Well, all they're gonna wanna do is go to casper.com

35:07.920 --> 35:09.120
One thing about me undies,

35:09.120 --> 35:12.080
just got a new batch in the mail yesterday.

35:12.080 --> 35:12.800
Jungle print.

35:12.800 --> 35:13.840
You got them jungle print?

35:13.840 --> 35:15.840
I got them jungle print on my loins too.

35:15.840 --> 35:16.880
Yeah, I put them on.

35:16.880 --> 35:18.240
I was like, where my dick go?

35:18.240 --> 35:19.600
And I was like, no, just kidding.

35:19.600 --> 35:20.080
There it is.

35:20.080 --> 35:21.280
And it looks fantastic.

35:21.280 --> 35:23.040
It changed my loins to lions.

35:23.040 --> 35:27.360
Me undies is so good.

35:27.360 --> 35:28.320
It's seriously the best.

35:28.320 --> 35:30.960
They're made of this tight micromodal fabric

35:32.160 --> 35:34.720
and which is sustainably sourced.

35:34.720 --> 35:36.320
It's twice as soft as cotton.

35:36.320 --> 35:37.680
It's indescribably comfortable.

35:37.680 --> 35:39.760
Once you try them on, you'll know why we call them

35:39.760 --> 35:41.040
the world's most comfortable underwear,

35:41.040 --> 35:42.560
why the world calls them that.

35:42.560 --> 35:44.560
And if you don't love your first pair, they're free.

35:44.560 --> 35:45.280
No questions asked.

35:45.280 --> 35:46.880
They won't be like, oh, really?

35:46.880 --> 35:49.200
Show them to me on your body now.

35:49.200 --> 35:50.160
How long have you worn?

35:50.160 --> 35:50.880
No, none of that.

35:50.880 --> 35:53.120
They won't send out the goon squad.

35:53.120 --> 35:55.440
They got dozens of styles, limited edition prints

35:55.440 --> 35:57.360
to help you make a statement with your loins,

35:58.000 --> 35:59.920
whether anyone can see them or not.

35:59.920 --> 36:01.600
But you'll know, and that's what's important.

36:01.600 --> 36:03.280

36:17.920 --> 36:21.040
I've got a message here for Chris from Cody.

36:21.040 --> 36:24.000
This is a personal Yumbotron message,

36:24.640 --> 36:26.480
which is what I'm calling Jumbotrons from now on

36:26.480 --> 36:27.440
because they're so yummy.

36:28.880 --> 36:31.600
After playing you the McElroy family fun hour episode,

36:31.600 --> 36:34.400
I was a bit disappointed when you didn't seem too entertained.

36:34.400 --> 36:37.680
But on my birthday, but on my birthday,

36:37.680 --> 36:39.680
when you made a special trip to pick us up a bag

36:39.680 --> 36:41.760
of Totino's cheddar blasted pizza rolls,

36:41.760 --> 36:43.280
I had to let the McElroy brothers

36:43.280 --> 36:45.200
and all the listeners know how much I love you

36:45.200 --> 36:47.440
and how lucky I am to be your husband.

36:47.440 --> 36:48.400
That's nice.

36:50.320 --> 36:53.200
I'm sorry that Chris was not immediately floored

36:53.200 --> 36:56.400
by our antics, but I'm glad that our viral marketing

36:56.400 --> 36:58.240
wormed its way into his brain.

36:58.240 --> 37:01.360
Yeah, those flavor biases shits is no joke.

37:02.000 --> 37:05.440
How do they get so many flavors and so much of them on it?

37:05.440 --> 37:06.560
It's, I can't tell.

37:06.560 --> 37:09.200
I think it goes a little something like this.

37:09.200 --> 37:10.160
I have another message here.

37:10.160 --> 37:13.760
This one's for Air Bear and it's from Meglett who says,

37:13.760 --> 37:15.280
oh, oh, they want us to sing.

37:15.280 --> 37:17.520
You can do this.

37:17.520 --> 37:19.680
Okay, it's a Hamilton thing.

37:19.680 --> 37:22.400
I know my sister like I know my own mind.

37:22.400 --> 37:25.680
You will never find bigger Bim Bam fans than she and I.

37:26.720 --> 37:27.760
That was really good.

37:27.760 --> 37:28.320
That was good.

37:28.320 --> 37:29.680
Can you do the whole thing or?

37:29.680 --> 37:31.200
If I tell her that I love him,

37:31.200 --> 37:33.360
she'd be residedly resigned.

37:33.360 --> 37:34.960
No, I meant the whole Jumbotron message.

37:34.960 --> 37:36.640
The whole Jumbotron, you dummy.

37:37.440 --> 37:38.800
Oh, I thought you meant the rest of the song.

37:39.600 --> 37:40.320
I could do that.

37:40.320 --> 37:42.080
That was straight off the dome, by the way.

37:42.080 --> 37:42.560
That was really good.

37:42.560 --> 37:44.000
Not even looking at the lyrics page.

37:44.000 --> 37:47.680
I said, oh, Aaron, you're as beautiful and wise as CJ Craig.

37:47.680 --> 37:49.760
She would definitely be friends with you, IRL,

37:49.760 --> 37:51.440
as would Lin-Manuel Miranda.

37:51.440 --> 37:53.440
Happy his birthday from your baby sister.

37:53.440 --> 37:56.080
May your zone be full of adventure in your 30th year.

37:57.680 --> 37:59.440
We'd never received that much direction.

37:59.440 --> 38:00.400
That's a lot of direction.

38:00.400 --> 38:02.080
I felt a little hemmed in.

38:02.080 --> 38:06.800
I wasn't able to do my freeform, you know, my comedy.

38:06.800 --> 38:07.680
A lot of handling.

38:07.680 --> 38:09.280
Yeah, a lot of handling going on.

38:09.280 --> 38:11.600
A lot of handling, a lot of navigation.

38:11.600 --> 38:14.320
Manhandling, I'd say.

38:14.320 --> 38:15.280
A dan handling.

38:16.240 --> 38:17.760
A lot of flan handling.

38:17.760 --> 38:18.640
Is this what we're doing?

38:20.720 --> 38:21.760
I'm Allegra Ringo.

38:21.760 --> 38:22.800
And I'm Renee Colbert.

38:22.800 --> 38:25.520
And we host a podcast called Can I Pet Your Dog?

38:25.520 --> 38:27.600
Renee, can I tell you about a dog I met this week?

38:27.600 --> 38:28.560
I wish that you would.

38:28.560 --> 38:31.120
In turn, though, can I tell you about a dog hero?

38:31.120 --> 38:34.800
May I tell you about a dog breed in a segment I like to call Mutt Minute?

38:34.800 --> 38:35.920
I would love that.

38:35.920 --> 38:37.760
Could we maybe talk about some dog tech?

38:37.760 --> 38:41.440
Could we have some cool guests on, like Lin-Manuel Miranda, Nicole Byer,

38:41.440 --> 38:42.240
and Ann Wheaton?

38:42.240 --> 38:44.320
I mean, yeah, absolutely.

38:44.320 --> 38:44.720
I'm in.

38:44.720 --> 38:45.360
You're on board.

38:45.360 --> 38:48.480
What do you say we do all of this and put it into a podcast?

38:48.480 --> 38:49.040
Yeah, OK.

38:49.040 --> 38:49.760
You think?

38:49.760 --> 38:50.320
Perfect.

38:50.880 --> 38:53.120
Should we call it, like, I don't know, Can I Pet Your Dog?

38:53.120 --> 38:53.600
Sure.

38:53.600 --> 38:54.000
All right.

38:54.560 --> 38:57.840
What do you say we put it on every Tuesday on Maximum Fun?

38:57.840 --> 38:58.960
Or on iTunes?

38:58.960 --> 38:59.840
Sounds good to me.

38:59.840 --> 39:00.560
Meeting's over.

39:04.240 --> 39:05.120
Do you want a Yahoo?

39:05.120 --> 39:05.620
Yeah.

39:06.560 --> 39:08.240
Do you guys want to get political or nah?

39:08.240 --> 39:08.480
Yeah.

39:08.480 --> 39:10.320
Yeah.

39:10.320 --> 39:12.720
So sent in by Zoe Kinski climbing that ladder.

39:12.720 --> 39:13.920
Or riding high.

39:13.920 --> 39:15.600
Think Zoe Kinski's riding high at this point.

39:17.440 --> 39:19.680
It's by Yahoo Answers user Gator who asks,

39:21.600 --> 39:24.160
is Mayor McChee's a Republican or a Democrat?

39:24.160 --> 39:24.660
Oh.

39:26.960 --> 39:28.320
No, no additional information.

39:29.200 --> 39:31.680
Elocuted or required?

39:31.680 --> 39:33.440
Or desired?

39:33.440 --> 39:35.120
Well, let's look at his policies.

39:35.120 --> 39:36.960
I think that'll give us a clear indication.

39:36.960 --> 39:37.760
Yeah.

39:37.760 --> 39:39.040
He's for flavor.

39:39.040 --> 39:40.000
Loves it.

39:40.000 --> 39:41.040
Loves the shit.

39:41.040 --> 39:44.720
But he's anti same sex marriage.

39:45.280 --> 39:45.680
OK?

39:46.400 --> 39:46.800
OK.

39:46.800 --> 39:50.960
So now I think that's I think now I think he's definitely for flavor.

39:50.960 --> 39:54.400
I think just like I don't think he's anti same sex marriage, right?

39:54.400 --> 39:56.080
Because they're all fry guys, right?

39:56.080 --> 40:00.000
What it really comes down to is is he pro grimace and bird person marriage?

40:00.560 --> 40:01.060
Yeah.

40:01.440 --> 40:02.560
That's the new frontier.

40:05.360 --> 40:06.160
He loves flavor.

40:06.160 --> 40:07.600
Let's just really focus on that.

40:07.600 --> 40:08.880
He's very pro flavor.

40:08.880 --> 40:09.440
We can all agree on that.

40:09.440 --> 40:10.880
His head is a his head is a hand.

40:10.880 --> 40:13.120
Like, let's not be let's not make fun here.

40:13.120 --> 40:14.800
His head's a fucking hamburger.

40:14.800 --> 40:16.160
And we know that.

40:16.160 --> 40:16.480
Right.

40:16.480 --> 40:18.640
I think he's got to be he's got to be tough on crime, right?

40:18.640 --> 40:21.760
Because I think if the hamburger ever tried to steal his head,

40:21.760 --> 40:24.720
which would kill him like that's a crime he doesn't want to happen.

40:24.720 --> 40:26.080
So he's got to be tough on crime.

40:26.080 --> 40:31.680
He's he's a living hamburger man who resigned over a world based around

40:31.680 --> 40:35.120
the selling and consuming of hamburgers.

40:35.120 --> 40:38.400
Well, I do want to get in here, Travis, and just correct you very quickly

40:38.400 --> 40:42.960
and that he's not necessarily a hamburger man, but his head is a hamburger.

40:42.960 --> 40:45.680
He definitely has a human body but a hamburger.

40:45.680 --> 40:47.680
Like, yeah, half hamburger, half man.

40:47.680 --> 40:48.800
He's a man burger.

40:48.800 --> 40:54.080
But this man burger is selling baby burgers to the public to consume.

40:55.680 --> 40:57.440
So is a man burger.

40:57.440 --> 41:01.440
That means that a guy fucked a burger and I'm gonna go ahead

41:01.440 --> 41:10.640
and put wimpy on blast here from Popeye definitely is is is Mayor McCheese's dad.

41:10.640 --> 41:15.680
I'm just saying that with his like cannibalistic like lifestyle,

41:15.680 --> 41:16.720
I feel like we could-

41:16.720 --> 41:18.400
I don't think he eats burgers, does he?

41:18.400 --> 41:21.040
But he but he like he wants those babies to be eaten.

41:21.040 --> 41:25.760
I feel like we could launch a very successful campaign against Mayor McCheese

41:25.760 --> 41:32.000
if we wanted like a coup to replace Mayor McCheese as the like mayor of Hamburger Town

41:32.000 --> 41:33.920
or whatever it's called, McDonaldland.

41:35.280 --> 41:38.240
Speaking of McDonaldland, I wanted to take a quick break

41:38.240 --> 41:40.960
to look at the Wikipedia page for McDonaldland.

41:40.960 --> 41:43.760
I want to tell you guys about the Wacky Adventures of Ronald McDonald.

41:43.760 --> 41:50.960
This is a videotape series released from 1998 to 2001 by Rugrats creators, Klaski Supo.

41:51.760 --> 41:52.800
I remember these tapes.

41:52.800 --> 41:57.040
Uh, the series depicted Ronald, Grimace, Birdie, the Hamburglar,

41:57.040 --> 41:59.120
and here's where we start to lose the plot a little bit.

41:59.120 --> 42:02.400
A few new characters like Ronald's pessimistic dog, Sunday.

42:03.040 --> 42:04.000
Well, hold on.

42:04.640 --> 42:05.280
Wait, what?

42:05.280 --> 42:06.240
Why would your dog-

42:06.240 --> 42:07.200
How could you-

42:07.200 --> 42:08.640
How could you live-

42:08.640 --> 42:12.400
Okay, you're a puppy named Sunday who lives in a place called McDonaldland

42:12.400 --> 42:13.520
and you're pessimistic?

42:13.520 --> 42:14.080
Surrounding us.

42:14.080 --> 42:14.800
How dare you?

42:14.800 --> 42:16.720
I don't know, Ronald.

42:16.720 --> 42:20.080
Even real living dogs in the Earth realm,

42:20.080 --> 42:23.280
not in the Dark realm where Mc- where Hamburgerland takes place.

42:23.280 --> 42:24.560
Not in the Upside Down.

42:24.560 --> 42:25.680
Not in the Upside Down.

42:25.680 --> 42:31.040
Fucking real dogs are not pessimistic unless they used to be Kevin Spacey

42:31.040 --> 42:33.840
and they got transformed by magic and are having a hard time finding their way home.

42:33.840 --> 42:38.000
Pessimistic is not a characteristic I've ever heard attributed to a dog.

42:39.280 --> 42:42.640
Yeah, my dog's one of those real, real, uh, uh,

42:42.640 --> 42:44.960
feeding dish half empty types of mutts.

42:44.960 --> 42:47.680
These videos would begin in live action

42:47.680 --> 42:50.720
in what resembled a futuristic McDonaldland.

42:50.720 --> 42:51.280
Fuck that.

42:51.280 --> 42:55.280
Then the characters would enter a tube or other means of travel.

42:55.280 --> 42:56.800
They would become animated.

42:56.800 --> 43:00.240
Hey, ClaskeySuba, I think you might be trying a little bit too hard.

43:00.240 --> 43:03.920
Seems like maybe the pre-production phase went on a little bit too long for this series.

43:03.920 --> 43:06.480
Maybe you should just, like, chill out a little bit.

43:06.480 --> 43:09.760
How much premise do you need for your animated series about McDonalds?

43:09.760 --> 43:11.760
How much grimace premise do you need?

43:12.480 --> 43:15.840
I'm pretty sure people already bought into the McDonald's brand enough

43:15.840 --> 43:20.400
that you didn't have to say, like, hey, you guys, let's really sell them on this cartoon.

43:21.600 --> 43:24.320
You guys realize they haven't been McDonaldland commercials since 2004?

43:24.320 --> 43:25.120
Isn't that weird?

43:25.120 --> 43:26.400
Doesn't it seem like they're still around?

43:28.480 --> 43:29.200
No, dog.

43:30.000 --> 43:32.320
I want to be the first to update this article

43:32.320 --> 43:36.000
because the last section covers the last 11 years of history

43:36.000 --> 43:37.760
and it says that they've been phased out,

43:37.760 --> 43:41.440
but the McDonaldland characters continue to appear at McDonald's play areas,

43:41.440 --> 43:44.240
decorative seats for children's birthday parties, and bibs.

43:44.240 --> 43:47.280
The only Ronald McDonald, Bertie, Grimace, and Hamburglar appear in them.

43:47.280 --> 43:50.480
They also appear in some soft drink cups until 2008.

43:50.480 --> 43:53.120
They do, however, still appear as cookies in pouches,

43:53.120 --> 43:55.200
respectfully titled McDonaldland Cookies.

43:55.200 --> 43:55.760
As of today, the characters-

43:55.760 --> 43:56.260
Rawr, rawr.

43:57.600 --> 44:01.520
They're still burning through the same McDonaldland cookies that they made in 2002.

44:01.520 --> 44:02.480
Guaranteed, absolutely.

44:02.480 --> 44:05.680
As of today, the characters appear on the windows of some McDonald's restaurants.

44:07.200 --> 44:11.200
Modern commercials nowadays usually depict Ronald McDonald alone in real world situations.

44:11.200 --> 44:12.960
So lonely, so all alone.

44:12.960 --> 44:17.920
So alone, exiled from his land,

44:18.880 --> 44:20.640
whether he visits a local restaurant

44:20.640 --> 44:23.680
or goes to visit sick children at a Ronald McDonald house.

44:23.680 --> 44:26.000
So like, I want to be the person who's like,

44:26.000 --> 44:28.640
oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, park, park, park, pull over, pull over.

44:28.640 --> 44:29.360
Check that window.

44:30.400 --> 44:31.440
That's a grimace.

44:31.440 --> 44:32.800
I'm putting this on Wikipedia.

44:33.440 --> 44:34.720
Yeah, we found him.

44:35.280 --> 44:36.000
We found him.

44:36.000 --> 44:37.200
That's another spot spotting.

44:38.400 --> 44:41.280
Is Mayor McCheese, is his first name Mayor?

44:41.280 --> 44:43.600
Does he actually have the title of Mayor or is his name just Mayor?

44:43.600 --> 44:46.320
I mean, but I'm looking, I've been doing some deep white googling

44:46.320 --> 44:48.160
and character description,

44:48.160 --> 44:50.400
Mayor of McDonaldland, the cheesiest burger in town.

44:50.400 --> 44:51.360
Is that how he got elected?

44:51.360 --> 44:52.960
Was there no like, proper vote?

44:52.960 --> 44:54.160
There's like, who's the cheesiest burger?

44:54.160 --> 44:56.400
Is this Ed Wynn-sounding motherfucker?

44:56.400 --> 44:59.440
According to the same Wiki that Justin and I are now the only two active users on

44:59.440 --> 45:00.640
in the whole internet,

45:00.640 --> 45:04.080
he's portrayed as a giggly, bumbling, and somewhat incompetent mayor.

45:04.080 --> 45:04.400
Well.

45:04.400 --> 45:06.640
Based on H.R. Puff and stuff,

45:06.640 --> 45:10.240
while the character was dropped during the streamlining of characters in the mid-80s.

45:10.240 --> 45:11.600
He died. He did die, I guess.

45:11.600 --> 45:12.560
He died.

45:12.560 --> 45:13.760
I guess he did die.

45:13.760 --> 45:15.680
I have a hard time picking out his affiliation here,

45:15.680 --> 45:17.760
but I feel like libertarian.

45:18.400 --> 45:20.720
That would be my, yeah, that would be my thinking.

45:22.000 --> 45:23.200
Oh, I'm actually looking here.

45:23.200 --> 45:24.560
It says Bull Moose Party.

45:25.680 --> 45:27.280
I'm basing that on almost nothing,

45:27.280 --> 45:29.120
but I imagine like, people would come to him and be like,

45:29.120 --> 45:31.440
Mayor McCheese, what are the laws?

45:31.440 --> 45:32.880
It's fucking chaos out here.

45:32.880 --> 45:34.320
Nobody's telling anybody what to do.

45:34.320 --> 45:36.320
And he's like, yep, exactly.

45:36.320 --> 45:41.280
And he like picks off one of his own sesame seeds and eats it.

45:41.280 --> 45:43.600
No gods, no kings, only food.

45:46.800 --> 45:48.720
No, says the man in Burger King.

45:50.960 --> 45:54.480
Does the sweat of my pickle belong to the bourgeoisie?

45:55.120 --> 45:57.200
Is the grease of my own bun on it?

45:58.320 --> 45:59.840
No, says Dave Thomas.

46:02.560 --> 46:04.320
No, says Long John Silver.

46:04.320 --> 46:08.880
No, says the man behind Captain D's, whose name I don't know.

46:08.880 --> 46:10.960
It probably starts with a D.

46:10.960 --> 46:12.880
It probably starts with a D, he's probably a captain.

46:13.840 --> 46:16.880
It seems your cup of Sprite has gone empty.

46:16.880 --> 46:19.440
You can refill it at the Fountainhead.

46:22.880 --> 46:24.720
Welcome to my play place.

46:27.200 --> 46:27.700
Stupid.

46:28.480 --> 46:30.480
This is a dumb fucking podcast.

46:30.480 --> 46:32.000
It's a dumb podcast.

46:32.000 --> 46:37.520
Hey brothers, I have a query, which I could use a little help with.

46:38.160 --> 46:42.320
My boyfriend and I have been going out for almost a year now and are talking about moving in together.

46:42.320 --> 46:44.240
One problem, he lives out of his car.

46:45.120 --> 46:46.240
Which has been cool.

46:48.240 --> 46:50.080
I just think of what his head sounds like.

46:50.080 --> 46:53.440
Because if you think about it, he's had a one hamburger, anyway.

46:53.440 --> 46:54.720
It's gotta be bad.

46:54.720 --> 46:56.240
Oh, you're talking about the Mayor McCheese.

46:56.240 --> 46:57.440
Mayor McCheese, one problem.

46:57.440 --> 46:58.480
Okay, let me start over.

46:58.480 --> 47:01.120
Not this man who lives in, I thought you were saying this person who lives in his car.

47:01.120 --> 47:03.600
No, Mayor McCheese's head, it's gotta be rough by now.

47:03.600 --> 47:05.760
I've been dating Mayor McCheese for about a year now.

47:05.760 --> 47:08.320
He lives out of his car, he hasn't had much work lately.

47:08.320 --> 47:10.880
Hey brothers, I have a query, which I could use a little help with.

47:10.880 --> 47:15.680
My boyfriend and I have been going out for almost a year now and are talking about moving in together.

47:15.680 --> 47:17.280
One problem, he lives out of his car.

47:17.280 --> 47:19.280
Which has been cool, I have my own place too.

47:19.280 --> 47:22.800
But the closer my lease is to ending, the more I notice when we talk about living together,

47:22.800 --> 47:27.680
the conversation sometimes ends up being about which van would be easiest for two people to live in.

47:27.680 --> 47:32.560
While I'm all for reducing my environmental impact, I was kind of hoping, what?

47:33.120 --> 47:33.840
It's a van?

47:33.840 --> 47:35.440
Sorry, go ahead, but it is a van.

47:35.440 --> 47:36.400
It is a van.

47:36.400 --> 47:40.000
My house is cool because it doesn't consume gasoline to go.

47:40.720 --> 47:42.720
I was kind of hoping to live somewhere with a toilet.

47:43.440 --> 47:48.480
So how do I tell him we're not living in a car without squashing his sense of freedom?

47:48.480 --> 47:50.400
That's from cramped in California.

47:50.400 --> 47:53.600
I don't, okay, so this is going to be a real tough one because I don't want to,

47:54.240 --> 47:56.960
I don't want to harsh anybody's mellow.

47:56.960 --> 48:00.640
I don't want, if this is his lifestyle and he's like into it, I don't get it personally.

48:00.640 --> 48:05.680
But, but there, okay, but there's, there's, there's some room here to discuss

48:05.680 --> 48:10.560
because the thing is, it's like compromise and like a little bit of giving 60-40,

48:10.560 --> 48:12.400
as Justin has talked about before.

48:12.400 --> 48:17.120
It's very important here because I feel like there is a,

48:17.120 --> 48:23.680
there is a middle ground between living in a car and living in like a three bedroom, two bathroom.

48:24.320 --> 48:24.560
Like-

48:24.560 --> 48:26.400
You know what that ground, you know what that ground is called?

48:26.400 --> 48:27.440
It's tiny house.

48:27.440 --> 48:29.040
Tiny home movement.

48:29.040 --> 48:33.200
I'm saying you could do tiny house that has a bathroom, has a toilet, has a tiny kitchen.

48:33.840 --> 48:37.520
Like feels like a tiny, it's not for me, God knows.

48:37.520 --> 48:41.600
But like this, or, or like a studio apartment even where it's like-

48:41.600 --> 48:43.840
Oh no, even better, even better.

48:43.840 --> 48:47.360
There's a new HDTV show because of course there's an HDTV show

48:47.360 --> 48:51.840
about literally any kind of container in which you can store yourself

48:51.840 --> 48:53.680
and your things and your loved ones.

48:53.680 --> 48:59.600
And there's one about houses that are also boats and I think it's called Boat Home.

48:59.600 --> 49:01.520
Yeah, you could be on Boat Home.

49:01.520 --> 49:04.240
You could be on Boat Home in a boat home, dude.

49:04.240 --> 49:05.600
Boat Home, Alabama.

49:05.600 --> 49:08.560
What if you tell him you want to do a tiny home and he decides to be a smart ass

49:08.560 --> 49:10.960
and you just come up one day and he's just taking the wheels off?

49:10.960 --> 49:12.640
Like there, mission accomplished.

49:12.640 --> 49:13.760
We live in a tiny home.

49:13.760 --> 49:17.040
No, because there are certain things that make a home and it's love and a bathroom.

49:17.920 --> 49:21.760
Me and my significant other, we celebrate the big car movement.

49:21.760 --> 49:27.040
It's better than a small car to live in, but Jesus, not much.

49:28.480 --> 49:29.920
Boat Home, Boat Home.

49:29.920 --> 49:31.520
How great would it be to be in a boat home?

49:31.520 --> 49:33.600
You're just like in the docks in Baltimore.

49:33.600 --> 49:35.840
You're just like, I'm done with Baltimore.

49:35.840 --> 49:37.360
Unhook, bye.

49:37.360 --> 49:39.600
Well, there's the other side of that where you wake up in the morning like,

49:39.600 --> 49:41.280
oh shit, we forgot to tie off.

49:41.280 --> 49:41.920
I miss Baltimore.

49:41.920 --> 49:44.640
Hey guys, family meeting on the poop deck.

49:44.640 --> 49:46.240
We don't live in Baltimore anymore.

49:47.600 --> 49:49.360
Neptune has decided for us.

49:49.360 --> 49:53.040
That's really good because if you need a toilet, it's right there.

49:53.040 --> 49:54.160
It's called the ocean.

49:54.160 --> 49:55.360
It's called the ocean.

49:55.360 --> 49:58.720
You just pop that, pop open the hole in the bottom of the boat.

49:58.720 --> 50:00.640
Oh no, our belongings.

50:00.640 --> 50:02.160
Why do birds have toilets?

50:03.760 --> 50:04.000
Yeah.

50:04.640 --> 50:05.840
Think about it.

50:05.840 --> 50:06.720
Yeah, I know.

50:06.720 --> 50:08.240
It's our pride, man.

50:09.120 --> 50:13.840
If you guys could have a boat home, what would it be?

50:13.840 --> 50:15.440
A full yacht home?

50:15.440 --> 50:16.400
Are you kidding me?

50:16.400 --> 50:19.040
Oh no, that's too, let's set a reasonable budget.

50:19.040 --> 50:19.680
Oh, okay.

50:19.680 --> 50:20.640
Well, you didn't-

50:20.640 --> 50:21.840
$150.

50:21.840 --> 50:26.400
I would want to live on a super massive boat that's 100 miles long.

50:26.400 --> 50:27.360
No, Trav.

50:27.360 --> 50:29.440
Okay, if I can't do pirate boat home.

50:29.440 --> 50:29.680
No.

50:30.400 --> 50:33.680
I would like to do, I'd like to go the other way then and do full like

50:34.320 --> 50:38.960
big river Tom Sawyer, just like a raft home.

50:40.320 --> 50:42.320
Oh, no roof, just right?

50:42.320 --> 50:45.280
Just me just out there with my friend Jim.

50:45.840 --> 50:48.080
Just looking up at the stars.

50:48.080 --> 50:51.280
And probably really hungry because we don't have a refrigerator or any way to store food.

50:51.280 --> 50:52.800
We don't have a toilet or anything, yeah.

50:53.760 --> 51:01.840
Could I just do, could I just get an RV and attach some really good balloons to it

51:01.840 --> 51:03.680
and just float that shit?

51:03.680 --> 51:04.640
Like Lazy Up?

51:05.360 --> 51:05.680
Yeah.

51:07.280 --> 51:08.400
Just float that RV.

51:08.400 --> 51:10.720
Up to open ocean?

51:10.720 --> 51:14.320
Up to with fewer balloons because the first one stressed me out.

51:14.320 --> 51:17.200
I remember watching Up one just going like, oh, God, that's a lot of balloons.

51:17.200 --> 51:19.040
Are there going to be that many the whole time?

51:19.040 --> 51:19.520
Shit.

51:21.520 --> 51:24.400
Wait, it was the sheer number of balloons bothering you?

51:24.400 --> 51:28.320
Did you see, do you remember watching Up and like when the house first opens up

51:28.320 --> 51:31.200
and you're like, oh, he's going to float the house on some balloons.

51:31.200 --> 51:36.000
But then there's like a million fucking balloons and you're just like, oh, man,

51:36.000 --> 51:38.400
that's way too many balloons to even look at.

51:40.640 --> 51:42.080
I don't know what you mean.

51:42.080 --> 51:43.920
Did you see the fucking movie?

51:43.920 --> 51:44.400
Yeah.

51:44.400 --> 51:44.880
Yeah.

51:44.880 --> 51:48.560
A lot of people stopped watching it after that very sad intro that you had to pay your

51:48.560 --> 51:52.320
tears tax for, but then you get, so a lot of people quit and they don't even know how

51:52.320 --> 51:56.000
many fucking balloons there were that popped out of that house, but there were so many

51:56.000 --> 51:59.840
and I just, I tried, I looked at them and I tried to count all of them and I was like,

51:59.840 --> 52:01.280
this is a fool's errand.

52:02.800 --> 52:04.160
Because there were too many balloons.

52:04.160 --> 52:06.880
So many balloons, it just got me so anxious.

52:08.160 --> 52:09.360
You know what I'm talking about?

52:09.360 --> 52:12.880
Right?

52:12.880 --> 52:13.200
Yeah.

52:13.200 --> 52:16.560
Balloons would start popping during that movie and like would fall out off the house and

52:16.560 --> 52:19.600
I'd be like, oh, thank God, more balloons that I don't have to worry about.

52:21.200 --> 52:24.960
But when they had the maximum number of balloons right there at like sort of like 25 minutes

52:24.960 --> 52:29.360
into the movie, I was like, fuck, that's way too many, way too many balloons.

52:29.360 --> 52:35.840
I don't want to live on a historic boat that we get some people coming by to like check

52:35.840 --> 52:36.160
it out.

52:36.160 --> 52:42.480
What about a ferry that's in operation?

52:43.120 --> 52:45.520
So every day you just have thousands of visitors.

52:46.160 --> 52:48.000
Welcome to my ferry.

52:48.000 --> 52:50.400
Would you like to play a video game with me?

52:50.400 --> 52:51.520
Oh, that's nice.

52:51.520 --> 52:56.080
We could play like some euchre, you know, just like it's so nice to have visitors.

52:56.080 --> 52:58.480
Please take your shoes off on the ferry.

52:58.480 --> 53:01.920
I would like to live on some kind of boat that no one believes that a human being should

53:01.920 --> 53:02.640
be living on.

53:03.520 --> 53:04.560
Like what, Travis?

53:04.560 --> 53:05.120
I don't know.

53:05.120 --> 53:09.600
Like maybe like one of those submarines that they use in planet Earth to go down and look

53:09.600 --> 53:11.520
at like the stuff way, way down there.

53:11.520 --> 53:13.680
And it's just big enough for like one and a half people.

53:13.680 --> 53:14.960
And it's got tiny portals.

53:14.960 --> 53:17.840
I would like for that to be my it's like a tiny boat home movement.

53:17.840 --> 53:18.960
That's what I'm going for.

53:20.000 --> 53:21.200
We're getting away from the point.

53:21.200 --> 53:24.800
Should this person live in their significant other's car?

53:24.800 --> 53:25.040
No.

53:25.600 --> 53:27.040
Who's fan are they going to live in?

53:29.120 --> 53:31.920
I mean, I really think tiny homes the way to go here.

53:31.920 --> 53:34.960
I watch them and I just think like that would be so great.

53:34.960 --> 53:36.320
I mean, it's not ideal for me.

53:36.320 --> 53:38.000
I don't know that I could stand it.

53:38.000 --> 53:41.760
But like, well, it's because you rip those cheesy blasters all the time, dog.

53:41.760 --> 53:43.680
You blow the doors off the motherfucker.

53:44.480 --> 53:48.240
Now, it's mostly that I would just be constantly like Harry and the Hendersons, like turning

53:48.240 --> 53:51.680
around and knocking stuff off of everything all the time.

53:51.680 --> 53:55.040
I do that now and I live in like a full sized home.

53:55.040 --> 54:00.880
I can't imagine how much chaos I would wreak upon a tiny home, but it would not be good.

54:00.880 --> 54:04.320
I would be like Alice in Alice in Wonderland, growing through with my arms and legs and

54:04.320 --> 54:05.760
head poking out the sides and top.

54:05.760 --> 54:06.800
Yeah, I love it.

54:06.800 --> 54:09.680
And then you get your tummy cut open, you're a cake the whole time.

54:09.680 --> 54:10.320
Exactly.

54:11.120 --> 54:15.440
I don't like the tiny homes where they've built an extensive outdoor area.

54:15.440 --> 54:18.560
It's like, hi, can you go home?

54:18.560 --> 54:19.600
You're cheating.

54:19.600 --> 54:20.160
Can you not?

54:21.040 --> 54:21.920
That's my home.

54:21.920 --> 54:24.000
That's part of my extended home, which is all outdoors.

54:24.000 --> 54:25.040
We have to share that.

54:25.040 --> 54:26.080
You can't claim it.

54:26.080 --> 54:30.480
I would like to have a tiny home that lives in the yard of my full sized home, and it's

54:30.480 --> 54:34.480
just like my retreat home just for me when I want to feel like a giant.

54:34.480 --> 54:37.120
Just the exact replica of your current home?

54:37.120 --> 54:39.680
Exactly the same, but like much smaller.

54:39.680 --> 54:43.040
What else would you have in your very tiny home, Travis?

54:43.040 --> 54:47.440
Tiny tables, tiny chairs, some tiny utensils.

54:47.440 --> 54:50.080
But they're all tiny to different scales.

54:50.080 --> 54:54.800
So the table is like for a mouse, but the chair is like for a dog.

54:54.800 --> 54:56.960
And it's like, well, this is just, come on.

54:56.960 --> 54:58.320
I don't want it to make sense.

54:58.320 --> 55:01.440
I want it to be like a tiny fun house, you know what I mean?

55:01.440 --> 55:04.720
And maybe one of the floors slanted, and it gets to feel like I'm in like a tiny mystery

55:04.720 --> 55:05.200
house.

55:05.200 --> 55:06.240
That's fun.

55:06.240 --> 55:07.840
Why aren't there tiny mystery houses?

55:09.280 --> 55:10.480
Why aren't there more?

55:10.480 --> 55:10.980
Why?

55:11.520 --> 55:14.960
Okay, why don't I have a house with a secret passage in it?

55:14.960 --> 55:16.800
Why don't any houses have secret passages?

55:16.800 --> 55:17.520
Well, yeah.

55:18.640 --> 55:19.680
Oh, you know what'd be great?

55:19.680 --> 55:23.760
A secret passage between your regular sized house and your tiny house so that when guests

55:23.760 --> 55:26.880
like fall asleep, you just push them through the secret passage and they wake up in the

55:26.880 --> 55:28.960
tiny house and they're like, what happened?

55:28.960 --> 55:30.000
That's good.

55:30.000 --> 55:31.760
I have a great fucking idea.

55:32.880 --> 55:33.680
Okay, I'm ready.

55:33.680 --> 55:40.480
You have to call the boyfriend's bluff by saying, oh, you want to live in a bigger vehicle?

55:40.480 --> 55:42.640
I was thinking we would simplify.

55:43.280 --> 55:49.520
I want to live with you, my darling love, on a horse, on a horse's back.

55:49.520 --> 55:51.520
That will be our home.

55:51.520 --> 55:54.960
That will be our home, an even smaller thing.

55:54.960 --> 55:59.440
It's going to be a big, it'll have a big saddle on it and we'll have some saddle bags where

55:59.440 --> 56:02.800
we'll keep one plate and one can of beans.

56:04.640 --> 56:07.120
That shall sustain us for the rest of our lives.

56:07.120 --> 56:10.640
That end our love on this, the back of a horse home.

56:11.760 --> 56:13.760
Have you seen the new TV show Horse Home?

56:15.200 --> 56:16.800
It's extremely short.

56:18.320 --> 56:19.840
Each episode is like two minutes.

56:19.840 --> 56:23.680
And June Jonathan is just like, this seems like a good horse.

56:23.680 --> 56:24.240
Saddle up.

56:24.800 --> 56:26.080
And that's a home now.

56:26.080 --> 56:28.400
That's a good, have fun out there.

56:28.400 --> 56:28.880
Be safe.

56:29.520 --> 56:30.800
Do you want an umbrella or something?

56:30.800 --> 56:31.680
Cause you know, okay.

56:32.400 --> 56:33.840
Just the one can of beans.

56:33.840 --> 56:34.400
Okay.

56:34.400 --> 56:35.520
What's the horse going to eat?

56:35.520 --> 56:37.040
You don't, the horse won't eat.

56:38.000 --> 56:38.880
Yeah, I guess so.

56:39.680 --> 56:43.360
I'm not a horseologist, but I think they would love some of those beans.

56:43.360 --> 56:44.960
But folks, that's going to do it for us.

56:44.960 --> 56:50.080
We hope you have enjoyed yourself here on the My Brother, My Brother and Me podcast.

56:50.080 --> 56:51.440
We're sorry if some parts were dumb.

56:51.440 --> 56:52.720
We don't mean for it to be dumb.

56:52.720 --> 56:54.720
You know, we're just doing our best out here.

56:56.960 --> 57:01.840
We want to say thank you to, let's see, the maximum fun.org network.

57:01.840 --> 57:05.680
We don't always give them top billing, but I want to take a moment to thank them for

57:05.680 --> 57:08.320
all they've done for us and for having us on their network.

57:08.320 --> 57:12.400
They've got a brand new show called tights and fights.

57:12.400 --> 57:13.120
Hell yeah.

57:13.120 --> 57:19.120
If you are a fan of wrestling at all, you're really going to enjoy this show.

57:19.120 --> 57:27.040
It includes as hosts for starters, our dear friend, Hal, who is a very funny person and

57:27.040 --> 57:29.680
great to play overwatch with highly recommended there.

57:29.680 --> 57:32.800
It also includes Mike Eagle and Daniel Radford.

57:32.800 --> 57:37.120
So you'll want to look for that wherever fine podcasts are sold.

57:37.120 --> 57:38.800
Tyson fights is the name of that one.

57:38.800 --> 57:39.600
It's about wrestling.

57:40.400 --> 57:42.640
We also want to let you know our monikers game.

57:42.640 --> 57:43.680
I believe it's still going.

57:43.680 --> 57:45.040
How many more days do they have?

57:46.080 --> 57:51.360
A handful, a handful, a small poultry handful by the time there will not be another episode

57:51.360 --> 57:52.160
before it ends.

57:52.160 --> 57:54.640
There are literally two days left as you're listening to this.

57:55.360 --> 57:56.400
Do not sleep.

57:56.400 --> 57:59.120
If you've been waiting till the last minute, this is the last minute.

57:59.120 --> 58:03.520
Go to mackroycollection.com order that now because it's not going to be available.

58:03.520 --> 58:06.080
Once that pre-order is done, it's gone.

58:06.080 --> 58:07.360
I really want to hit this hard.

58:07.360 --> 58:11.280
We have no plans to sell it as a product after this pre-order.

58:11.280 --> 58:14.000
The only people that are going to get it are people that pre-order it.

58:14.000 --> 58:17.840
I hope we've made it explicitly clear because I will shout down anybody who I won't shout

58:17.840 --> 58:21.120
down, but you don't, don't wait until next week.

58:21.120 --> 58:23.760
And it's like, oh, I should get, you cannot get it at that point.

58:23.760 --> 58:24.560
It's only a pre-order.

58:24.560 --> 58:28.560
It's the only way that we know how to make as many as we need.

58:28.560 --> 58:33.200
A portion of all sales are going to go to grow Huntington, which is an organization

58:33.200 --> 58:37.520
here in our home city that is fighting addiction with urban farming.

58:37.520 --> 58:41.120
They actually just got their land and they are trying to get the money together to get

58:41.120 --> 58:43.280
this urban farm going for people who are in addiction recovery.

58:44.080 --> 58:49.360
It is, it is a great, great effort, and we hope to be able to support them a lot.

58:49.360 --> 58:52.800
And every time you buy a copy of our game at mackroycollection.com, you are helping

58:52.800 --> 58:53.360
to do that.

58:53.360 --> 58:55.760
You can find more info on that group.

58:55.760 --> 58:56.880
Grow Huntington.

58:56.880 --> 58:59.440
That's G-R-O Huntington dot org.

58:59.440 --> 59:01.440
The expansion is only ten dollars.

59:02.160 --> 59:03.120
Help support us.

59:03.120 --> 59:04.640
Help support Grow Huntington.

59:04.640 --> 59:07.280
And, you know, get a fun game for you and your friends to play together.

59:07.280 --> 59:08.720
mackroycollection.com.

59:08.720 --> 59:09.440
Do not wait.

59:09.440 --> 59:10.320
Go there now.

59:10.320 --> 59:12.000
We wouldn't do this if the game sucked.

59:12.000 --> 59:13.040
It's a fucking great game.

59:13.040 --> 59:13.760
We played all the time.

59:13.760 --> 59:17.120
OK, I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters for using our theme song It's

59:17.120 --> 59:18.800
Departure off the album Putting the Days to Bed.

59:19.920 --> 59:20.880
We plug Max Fun.

59:20.880 --> 59:23.360
We have other podcasts that we do both on and off Max Fun.

59:23.360 --> 59:25.600
You can find all those at mackroyshows.com.

59:25.600 --> 59:27.280
You can also find out how to get in touch with us.

59:27.280 --> 59:29.360
I think Travis finally added my PO box info.

59:29.360 --> 59:30.160
I did.

59:30.160 --> 59:31.120
I did it.

59:31.120 --> 59:33.920
Speaking of other podcasts, I did want to give a quick plug for it.

59:33.920 --> 59:35.360
This is not a Max Fun show.

59:35.360 --> 59:41.040
But my cousin, Michael, and my father-in-law, Tommy, just started a new podcast called Court

59:41.040 --> 59:41.760
Appointed.

59:41.760 --> 59:47.440
Michael's a lawyer, and the show is sort of about pop culture and how it intersects with

59:47.440 --> 59:48.000
the law.

59:48.000 --> 59:51.520
And you will learn things, but you're also going to have a lot of fun.

59:51.520 --> 59:54.160
There's a lot of dad jokes, and it's a very funny podcast.

59:54.160 --> 59:56.800
And I think you will very much enjoy it.

59:56.800 --> 59:59.120
They are on iTunes.

59:59.120 --> 01:00:00.960
Just search for Court Appointed.

01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:02.480
The response to it has been really, really good.

01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:03.840
And I think you'll really like it.

01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:07.200
I think you'll really like it if you ever listen to Sawbones or Schmaners, which is

01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:09.920
sort of that historical kind of comedy podcast.

01:00:09.920 --> 01:00:10.640
I think you'll dig this.

01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:13.120
It's sort of a legal take on that sort of structure.

01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:13.760
I think you'll dig it.

01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:14.880
It's called Court Appointed.

01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:15.920
Check it totally out.

01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:18.880
I do a show with my friend, Tybee, called Interrobang.

01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:20.640
We are doing our first ever live show.

01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:22.800
Saturday the 13th is when the live show is.

01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:25.040
It's at the Three Clubs here in Los Angeles.

01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:26.640
Tickets are only $8 at the door.

01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:27.840
Come out.

01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:28.880
It's going to be a really great time.

01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:30.560
The show's at 730.

01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:35.200
So if you're in L.A. and you want to come out and either check out a new podcast or

01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:39.920
support a podcast you already like, the Three Clubs, 730, August 13th.

01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:42.800
Come see Interrobang live for the first time ever anywhere.

01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:44.000
Do you guys want that final?

01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:44.960
Yes, please.

01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:45.440
I'm ready.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:46.480
Here it comes.

01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:50.240
Sent in by level9000, Yaju Drew, Drew Davenport.

01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:50.800
Thank you, Drew.

01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:53.680
It's by YajuAnswersUser.

01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:56.160
J Money, 36, 116.

01:00:57.920 --> 01:00:58.720
J Money asks,

01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:04.240
What kind of apple juice comes in a small glass jar like the ones that were on the TV show, Martin?

01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:10.000
My name is Justin McElroy.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.440
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:12.400
I'm Griffin McElroy.

01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:13.440
I know what he's talking about.

01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:15.440
Those shits was on Boy Meets World too.

01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:16.160
You look good.

01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:18.240
Beautiful little gloves and refreshment.

01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:19.840
This has been my brother and my brother and me.

01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:33.440
You and my brother and my brother and me kiss your dad's grub on the lips.

01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:41.680
Maximumfun.org.

01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:42.720
