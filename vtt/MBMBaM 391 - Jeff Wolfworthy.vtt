The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.640 --> 00:47.360
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother, my brother mean advice show for the modern era.

00:47.360 --> 00:52.160
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother Travis McElroy.

00:52.160 --> 00:56.160
I'm your sweet baby brother and 30 under 30 media luminary Griffin McElroy.

00:56.160 --> 01:00.960
Are you ready for more football? I'm ready for twice the amount of

01:00.960 --> 01:05.360
football I currently consume, which would still determined night of the week party.

01:06.720 --> 01:12.400
It's some night and the balls are hot. Don't touch the balls cause you'll burn your hands.

01:12.400 --> 01:17.760
We have a bunch of some announcers to be determined. They're going to get it kickstarted

01:18.400 --> 01:24.720
or maybe like handoff started. We don't know. We haven't finished out the rules yet.

01:24.720 --> 01:29.920
There may not even be a ball this time. It's football of the mind XFL.

01:29.920 --> 01:32.960
You probably guess we're starting an XFL team.

01:32.960 --> 01:37.440
And you've everybody's been asking us to do this even before Vince came out and made his

01:37.440 --> 01:40.800
definitely real announcement about the thing that's definitely definitely going to happen,

01:40.800 --> 01:46.400
which is the XFL. Very exciting new football proposition where a catch is a catch and you

01:46.400 --> 01:55.040
can't ever protest for any reason ever. And it's very I mean to me both those is yeah. Vince,

01:55.040 --> 02:01.760
I definitely get it. I don't get it as somebody who got in early with the XFL with our new the

02:01.760 --> 02:09.040
next XFL, the XXFL. We have gotten like first out. The first thing we had to figure out was,

02:09.040 --> 02:15.280
of course, the team. What are they? Yeah, I'm pushing for the Milton somethings.

02:15.280 --> 02:20.640
Oh, I thought you literally meant like what species are we going to put on the field?

02:21.440 --> 02:26.640
OK, you mean does XFL it's yeah. Trav brings up a good point. Could be anything out there.

02:27.280 --> 02:34.960
Bunch of frogs. They're all pumas. Yeah, they're all the name of the team is the Jaguars.

02:34.960 --> 02:39.440
And people are not going to they're going to there's going to be a lot of dissonance there.

02:39.440 --> 02:44.080
And as long as this thing's just a big old stinking middle finger to the NFL,

02:44.080 --> 02:49.120
we may as well just make it the Jacksonville Jaguars again. OK, fucking come at us because

02:49.120 --> 02:54.640
it's a different thing. Bortles, because that's the thing about the XFL. It's it's literally no

02:54.640 --> 02:59.600
rules, no rights. Well, there's one. Travis, I do have to stop you right there because there's one

02:59.600 --> 03:05.040
very important rule. What's that? And that is you can never express your dissatisfaction with

03:05.040 --> 03:10.000
anything for any reason ever. Or else Vince will come to his house, to your house even.

03:10.000 --> 03:15.600
You'll come to Vince's house. That's how he does it. And he'll unhinge his jaw and he'll eat you.

03:15.600 --> 03:20.640
Oh, OK. The rule is and then we have a list of some. Where did I put my list of

03:21.440 --> 03:29.360
rules? Oh, here it is. Here it is. So the first rule of the XFL obviously is if you kneel during

03:29.360 --> 03:37.040
the anthem, you have to eat an entire airplane tire. And that is stringent. I will agree.

03:37.040 --> 03:43.120
Draconian. I might argue. Draconian. The penalty actually goes up. So the second time you kneel

03:43.120 --> 03:47.200
during the anthem, you are going to have to consume an entire landing gear. And if you're

03:47.200 --> 03:52.720
particularly frustrated and you feel compelled to kneel by the end of the season, I mean,

03:52.720 --> 03:57.680
you could be eating an entire airplane. Well, this is why I've actually heard some owners and players

03:57.680 --> 04:01.280
already planning that how they're going to work around this is they're going to kneel once, eat

04:01.280 --> 04:08.640
the tire, but never get up. Yeah. Yeah. Just do all the football from sort of the from a sort of

04:08.640 --> 04:14.640
prone kneeling position. Yeah. And listen, it's tough, but if you get like knee pads with wheels

04:14.640 --> 04:20.960
on them, call them kneelies. And then, yeah, we can definitely market that to the eight people

04:20.960 --> 04:29.760
who are going to watch this. Hey, Vince, you dumb asshole. Do you realize the fucking delicious

04:29.760 --> 04:37.360
Footloose-esque situation you are setting? Now, no, this is a sports with no protesting. You hear

04:37.360 --> 04:45.680
the first fucking guy that gets down on the knee is going. It is going to be so much more powerful.

04:45.680 --> 04:51.920
You big, dumb asshole. What are you like fucking Babe Ruth calling his shot? But Babe Ruth just

04:51.920 --> 04:56.400
held up the middle finger to everybody. I've got this idea for a new football league that will

04:56.400 --> 05:02.240
generate the most powerful political statement ever created by sport. What the fuck? Are you

05:02.240 --> 05:09.440
out of your fucking mind, Vince? You can't ever. Like, I'll never experience the thrilling level

05:09.440 --> 05:16.960
of dancing in an area where dancing has been forbidden, because that would just be the best,

05:16.960 --> 05:24.800
funnest dance that you could do, I think. And that is the situation that he has developed here,

05:24.800 --> 05:30.720
where it's like, protests? Well, no, not here. That's the best protest you can do,

05:31.360 --> 05:36.240
is when they tell you you can't. That's actually how protesting works. That's how it works, dog.

05:38.240 --> 05:48.320
Jesus, Vince. Vince. It's just disgusting, man. It's just no way. The towns that had one before,

05:48.320 --> 05:55.280
right? You're not going to fool them once, et cetera, et cetera. So it's going to be all second

05:55.280 --> 06:00.960
stringer towns, right? Or third string towns. Because I guess the first string has NFL,

06:00.960 --> 06:07.360
and the second string had the XFL the first time. So now you're down to third tier towns. And that's

06:07.360 --> 06:12.560
not to besmirch the good name of Milton, but if this thing tanks, I didn't want Huntington all

06:12.560 --> 06:16.640
tied up with it. We did have our own arena football team, the Huntington- The River City

06:16.640 --> 06:25.520
Locomotives. The River City Locomotives. Thank you, Griffin. Great team. Lots of fumbles.

06:28.000 --> 06:35.440
Just number the stars that it's about that may fumble. I was actually in an and for the River

06:35.440 --> 06:42.000
City Locomotives when they were looking for a new mascot. And my thing was, I just strode around the

06:42.000 --> 06:48.160
stage going choo-choo, choo-choo. And if I remember how the ad went, I got the job. So if you can get

06:48.160 --> 06:53.440
that on YouTube somewhere, just please let me know. And if I remember correctly, I think our dad owned

06:53.440 --> 06:58.960
1% of the River City. He was the emcee of the River City Locomotives, which meant we got free soda,

06:58.960 --> 07:07.120
which if we do get the XFL team, the Milton big lads going, then I'm hoping that that is a benefit

07:07.120 --> 07:13.280
that will continue, because then I will be full-throated support of this new, exciting,

07:13.280 --> 07:16.800
not going to happen- Well, unfortunately, you have to do full-throated support. Like, that's the problem.

07:16.800 --> 07:21.520
It's like, so we're probably not going to do that team. I don't think we should probably support that.

07:22.640 --> 07:26.800
I mean, I could try out. I mean, they're going to need eight teams of 40 people each. That's what?

07:26.800 --> 07:33.200
Like 800 people. And I think I stand a pretty good shot. Never could make the Comac Middle School

07:33.200 --> 07:39.520
basketball team, but I actually think I stand a better chance of getting in on this new football

07:40.320 --> 07:44.400
league. And then my friend Stone Cold Steve Austin's going to come in and be like,

07:44.400 --> 07:50.000
you can't escape me, Vincent. Crush a high life. And then crush Vincent's skull right there in front

07:50.000 --> 07:56.560
of God and everyone. And then we'll be the new kings of football. And you'll kneel, but to us,

07:56.560 --> 08:02.640
me and my friend Austin, which is what I call him, even though it's his last name.

08:03.840 --> 08:09.280
So anyway. So what do you guys think about the new Fall Out Boy album? I think it's really good.

08:09.280 --> 08:15.600
Yeah. Okay. Let's do a question. Every year, a local theater has a 24-hour Groundhog Day marathon.

08:15.600 --> 08:20.080
If you stay through the entire 24 hours, 12 screenings, you win movie passes for a year.

08:20.640 --> 08:25.600
I'm planning on going this year and by God, I'm getting those movie passes. How do you suggest I

08:25.600 --> 08:29.840
pass the time, other than bringing my 3DS with Pokemon Ultra Moon and headphones to listen to

08:29.840 --> 08:35.040
my Bim Bam? I'm going with one friend, so we're also thinking about bringing cards slash board

08:35.040 --> 08:40.160
games and any suggestions are welcome. That's from Bed Sores with Bill Murray. I got a pretty good

08:40.160 --> 08:45.120
thing you could do. Yeah, I have a super good suggestion. You could watch one of the best

08:45.120 --> 08:49.920
movies ever made. Yeah, you could just kind of tune into the giant screen in front of you and

08:49.920 --> 08:55.040
watch the best movie ever, is what you might do. Because here's what you get. You get an amazing

08:55.040 --> 09:03.120
one to see. I would love to see Groundhog Day in theaters. But also, maybe by that 24th hour,

09:03.120 --> 09:10.000
that 12th viewing, you have realized whole new theories and nuances about this film.

09:10.000 --> 09:14.880
Yeah. It's a wild film. If you read some of the stuff that was cut from Groundhog Day,

09:14.880 --> 09:21.760
it is wild. It supposedly encapsulates, I think I read 10,000 years.

09:21.760 --> 09:26.000
So there's not a canonical length of time. There's not, but as originally written,

09:26.000 --> 09:32.320
it was like 10,000 years. There's also originally a curse that a scorned ex placed on Bill Murray's.

09:32.320 --> 09:36.560
You can find out all about this on Chuck's podcast, Movie Crush I was on, where I talked

09:36.560 --> 09:44.960
about this, my favorite movie of all time. I would not do this for anything because this

09:44.960 --> 09:49.040
really is my favorite movie ever. And I do worry that watching it 12 times in one day

09:49.040 --> 09:54.640
would make it not my favorite movie ever. And I do not want that to be stripped away.

09:55.360 --> 10:01.440
Can I pitch to you? I had an idea the other day about if I were going to make a Groundhog Day-esque

10:01.440 --> 10:10.160
movie. Something that I cannot think of because the whole live the same day over again is not

10:10.160 --> 10:14.240
solely contained to Groundhog Day. Let me just say this real quick. Let me

10:14.240 --> 10:19.120
preface this by saying we are on a really good streak right now of you not pitching movies

10:19.120 --> 10:24.080
that is not going to get made on a podcast. It's been like 90 episodes or so.

10:24.800 --> 10:27.360
Someone should make this movie. I don't know if I'm going to make it, but somebody should

10:27.360 --> 10:30.720
make this movie because I don't think it's ever been done before. A Groundhog Day,

10:30.720 --> 10:38.000
same day over again kind of thing, but everyone is aware of it. It's not just one person.

10:38.000 --> 10:45.680
Everyone wakes up going, again? Because I think it would get really apocalyptic really fast.

10:46.400 --> 10:52.320
Very like Caligulin-like. No, yeah, it would turn into a big old bone

10:52.320 --> 10:58.320
pile. How about this idea for a movie? It's a Groundhog Day, but a man lives every second

10:58.320 --> 11:10.640
over again, and so he's just like, fuck shit up, no, crap, fuck, no, shit up, it's happening again,

11:11.760 --> 11:25.680
Andy McDowell, I fuck you, and I realize that this whole time I've been so selfish.

11:25.680 --> 11:29.520
I don't know why he became a robot there close to the end, but that was a good two minutes of

11:29.520 --> 11:35.040
the podcast that we don't have to worry about. That's gone now. And two minutes of your life

11:35.040 --> 11:41.040
listening at home, so sorry about that. One thing that would be fun is, you know how Bill

11:41.040 --> 11:45.120
Murray lives the same day over and over again in that movie and he starts to learn things so he

11:45.120 --> 11:49.120
seems like he can predict the future because he doesn't before they happen? You could see if you

11:49.120 --> 11:53.040
watch it enough, you might be able to start beating Bill to some of them so it makes him

11:53.040 --> 11:57.040
look like the clown because you said the lady was going to drop the dishes before the lady

11:57.040 --> 12:00.400
dropped the dishes, but also before Bill Murray said the lady was going to drop the dishes.

12:01.200 --> 12:08.800
What if in Groundhog Day Chris Elliott is also reliving the same day over and again because he

12:08.800 --> 12:14.480
can't say that to Bill Murray because he doesn't know that Bill Murray's living the same day over

12:14.480 --> 12:20.400
again. Good point. What if everyone is independently in Groundhog Day living the same day over again?

12:20.400 --> 12:25.120
Chris Elliott is living the same day over again, but he's just rolling with it.

12:25.120 --> 12:27.280
Yeah, he's loving it.

12:27.280 --> 12:32.160
This day was as fine as any of my other days. This is as good a day as any to just sort of

12:32.160 --> 12:40.480
kick it in. I think that I'll go ahead and just live in this day for a while. That's fine. You

12:40.480 --> 12:46.400
know, one thing you could do is if you watch it enough, I bet you could figure out which scenes

12:46.400 --> 12:51.920
are Bill Murray's butt double and which scenes are just actually Bill Murray because it's hard

12:51.920 --> 12:57.760
with the lighting in some of the scenes, some of the extended sex scenes, to figure out which one

12:57.760 --> 13:00.960
is Bill Murray and which one is his butt double. Lorenzo music.

13:00.960 --> 13:05.360
Oh, I thought you said that, but I had a different joke, so I was wondering if I could do mine.

13:08.160 --> 13:09.600
Live the joke over again.

13:09.600 --> 13:14.480
Okay, we do the joke over again. It's confusing. It's actually a lot of times Brian Doyle-Murray

13:14.480 --> 13:19.200
because they said, like, we need a brother's butt. Like, you know how in my butt scenes in

13:19.200 --> 13:23.920
the Bim Bam shows, sometimes we just swap out one. Well, Justin's butt. Travis has the enormous

13:23.920 --> 13:24.800
tattoo.

13:24.800 --> 13:28.800
Well, that's why we just rotate butts. Griffin does it for Justin. Justin does it for me,

13:28.800 --> 13:32.560
and I do it for Griffin. It's hard to keep him in mind, you know?

13:32.560 --> 13:36.800
And in the scenes where Brian Doyle-Murray's butt is, because he plays the mayor, if memory serves,

13:37.840 --> 13:41.920
Bill would step in and be like, don't worry. Take a load off, Brian.

13:41.920 --> 13:48.960
I like Griffin's joke because it doesn't require an in-depth knowledge of voice actors that have

13:48.960 --> 13:53.120
played roles originated by Bill Murray. So I love that part of it.

13:53.120 --> 13:56.160
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. See, that was so deep I didn't even get it.

13:58.400 --> 14:02.720
So it's kind of funny because Lorenzo music played Peter Vinkman in the Ghostbusters cartoon,

14:03.440 --> 14:08.720
and then Lorenzo music did the voice of Garfield, and then Bill Murray in the TV show,

14:08.720 --> 14:11.360
but then after that, Bill Murray did the voice of Garfield in the movie.

14:11.360 --> 14:15.680
And then finally Bill Murray was free, and he could leave that cave.

14:15.680 --> 14:17.840
He'd been trapped in by Lorenzo music.

14:17.840 --> 14:19.600
Trav, do you want to do one?

14:19.600 --> 14:21.040
Yeah, do you want to try a joke about a butt?

14:21.040 --> 14:26.800
Oh, okay. About Bill Murray's butt?

14:26.800 --> 14:27.680
Yeah, about his hiney.

14:29.360 --> 14:33.920
Yeah, it gets confusing because sometimes it's Bill Murray, but sometimes it's Garfield.

14:36.480 --> 14:38.640
Yeah, so if you see a big furry orange butt.

14:38.640 --> 14:41.440
Now that one kind of built off of what I did.

14:42.080 --> 14:46.080
Well, but if I had done mine first, it would have seemed like yours built off of mine,

14:46.080 --> 14:47.440
so who's to say?

14:47.440 --> 14:51.440
That's a very good point, but I think yours would have seemed like the ravings of a madman.

14:51.440 --> 14:55.680
Yeah, is there a way to combine all three of our jokes into something that it's even remotely,

14:55.680 --> 14:57.280
like even a little bit funny?

14:59.840 --> 15:02.320
Yeah, so maybe if we just say all the names at the same time,

15:03.280 --> 15:05.040
and it's sort of a choose your own adventure.

15:05.040 --> 15:10.240
Isn't it fun that in Brian Doyle Murray's name, Doyle just really stands out in there?

15:10.240 --> 15:12.800
Because if he was just Brian Murray, it's like, oh, that could be anyone.

15:12.800 --> 15:15.760
But Brian Doyle Murray, now we've got-

15:15.760 --> 15:20.400
He probably did it intentionally to like make the differentiation clear, right?

15:20.400 --> 15:21.200
I have to assume.

15:22.240 --> 15:23.360
How about a yeah?

15:23.360 --> 15:25.360
Yeah, give me another question.

15:25.360 --> 15:26.640
This one was sent in by Aaron Keys.

15:26.640 --> 15:27.120
Thank you, Aaron.

15:27.120 --> 15:28.400
It's Yahoo Answers user.

15:28.400 --> 15:29.440
Chaz Van Bloom.

15:30.080 --> 15:33.600
Nope, Chaz Van Blom, even better, asks,

15:33.600 --> 15:37.760
how deep inside an apple is the most nutrition?

15:38.640 --> 15:41.280
Enjoying a freshly cut Washington state apple.

15:41.280 --> 15:45.040
And they put the R marked on it for a trademark.

15:45.040 --> 15:46.160
Mm-hmm.

15:46.160 --> 15:47.040
I don't think Washington state-

15:47.040 --> 15:49.680
Washington state brand apples from Oregon.

15:50.560 --> 15:56.320
How if different nutritional value is the, if, so wait, you've offered me a choice here.

15:56.320 --> 16:01.360
So I'm gonna go with, if different is the nutritional value is the peel depth to the

16:01.360 --> 16:06.720
center where the seeds sit, does the flesh of the apple go into varying ranges with changing

16:06.720 --> 16:09.600
nutritional levels getting higher toward the seeds?

16:09.600 --> 16:16.880
Remembering earth science slash AG classes, do vegetables, onions, beets, et cetera, have

16:16.880 --> 16:21.760
this same nutritional range that varies as by how deep the veggie is cut.

16:22.640 --> 16:23.600
You're eating an apple.

16:23.600 --> 16:24.100
Mm-hmm.

16:25.760 --> 16:28.080
Certainly you've cut it up because worms.

16:28.080 --> 16:36.000
And you're eating the apple, where's this, where's that pocket of those dank nutrients at?

16:36.000 --> 16:37.840
Because a lot of people look at the apple and say, I get that.

16:37.840 --> 16:42.480
That's the skin, that's the flesh, it's really fucked up, that's what we call those two things.

16:42.480 --> 16:46.880
And then there's the core with the seeds, which people eat only as YouTube-like challenges.

16:48.640 --> 16:55.920
But is there other sort of zones in the apple that are best for you?

16:55.920 --> 17:05.840
Like striation, like the strata of apple, that as you move down through, the crust, the core.

17:05.840 --> 17:12.160
You bind into the apple and you hit the vitamin pocket, and it expels a gaseous cloud of vitamins

17:12.160 --> 17:14.240
that you breathe in and you're stronger.

17:14.240 --> 17:18.480
We'll get the obvious out of the way first, it ain't the seeds, because those contain

17:18.480 --> 17:21.200
a chemical that's transformed into cyanide in your stomach.

17:21.200 --> 17:24.400
Though admittedly, not enough to do you.

17:24.400 --> 17:26.560
Not enough to do you any damage.

17:26.560 --> 17:28.960
You would have to eat something like a million apples.

17:30.480 --> 17:32.800
No, between 150 and a few thousand should do it, actually.

17:32.800 --> 17:34.240
A lot, a lot of apples.

17:34.240 --> 17:35.040
A lot, a lot.

17:35.040 --> 17:36.640
How am I supposed to eat all these apples?

17:36.640 --> 17:38.000
Aren't my crash bandicoot?

17:38.000 --> 17:40.480
I thought those were mangoes.

17:40.480 --> 17:42.320
Shh, they're a wump of fruit.

17:42.320 --> 17:42.880
It's fine, though.

17:42.880 --> 17:45.680
Not everybody knows as much about crash bandicoot as I do.

17:45.680 --> 17:50.160
So don't eat the seeds, because cyanide, not good.

17:50.720 --> 17:52.480
There's probably some good stuff in there, too.

17:52.480 --> 17:57.280
It's not just, if you pour a bunch of cyanide in the ground, an apple tree doesn't climb

17:57.280 --> 17:57.920
out of it.

17:57.920 --> 18:01.920
But I need to clarify for everybody, the vitamins are in the seeds, okay?

18:01.920 --> 18:03.760
Like, not those.

18:03.760 --> 18:04.720
Here's where I'm coming from.

18:05.760 --> 18:10.320
I look at an apple and I say, I obviously want the vitamins out of this, because that's

18:10.320 --> 18:11.280
how I look at all food.

18:11.280 --> 18:14.240
I look at a pizza, I say, there's probably not many vitamins in here, but I'll figure

18:14.240 --> 18:15.760
out where these motherfuckers are.

18:15.760 --> 18:22.400
I look at an apple and I say, this is going to be a lot of work if I do a vitamin excavation

18:22.400 --> 18:24.080
looking for the vitamins in here.

18:24.080 --> 18:28.080
I want to get in, I want to get that vitamin pocket, and I want to get out.

18:28.080 --> 18:29.520
Where's that thing hiding?

18:29.520 --> 18:30.720
Where is that little bubble hiding?

18:31.760 --> 18:32.400
In the seeds.

18:33.200 --> 18:34.240
Well, shoot, Trav.

18:34.240 --> 18:37.040
That's about as deep in the apple as it gets, I think.

18:37.040 --> 18:39.520
Well, yeah, but the apple has to protect itself.

18:39.520 --> 18:40.960
Now, here's the thing, Justin, to your point.

18:40.960 --> 18:42.880
It is not the seeds that contain the vitamin.

18:42.880 --> 18:47.040
It is the pockets that contain the seeds, contains the vitamins.

18:47.040 --> 18:51.440
Oh, so I jammed my tongue in there, in one of those seed holes, and now all of a sudden

18:51.440 --> 18:53.120
I just got 10% stronger.

18:53.120 --> 18:54.880
Oh, yeah, so strong.

18:54.880 --> 18:55.920
It's possible.

18:55.920 --> 18:56.640
Think about it.

18:57.280 --> 19:03.040
I would think that it would want to keep the nutrients close to its center for its apple

19:03.040 --> 19:04.000
babies, the seeds.

19:04.000 --> 19:04.500
Yeah.

19:05.040 --> 19:10.400
So you have to assume that the good stuff is towards the center, but not the center itself.

19:10.400 --> 19:11.520
And the apple's fine.

19:11.520 --> 19:16.000
Is there something in the stem that we should be eating?

19:16.000 --> 19:16.720
I don't know about that.

19:16.720 --> 19:20.400
I'm wanting to get to the stem next, because there's something going on there, isn't there?

19:20.400 --> 19:21.680
Because nobody's eating that.

19:21.680 --> 19:24.880
We'll talk about the stem, and then we'll talk about the apple butthole on the other side.

19:25.760 --> 19:27.840
Maybe let's talk about eating the apple's ass.

19:29.760 --> 19:32.160
This is all that people are talking about these days.

19:32.160 --> 19:34.000
Is eating the apple's ass.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.440
The apple ass challenge.

19:35.440 --> 19:39.920
Well, specifically just eating ass, and I'm wondering if it's because they're really

19:39.920 --> 19:41.920
talking about getting it at the apple bottom.

19:41.920 --> 19:42.400
Yeah.

19:42.400 --> 19:45.440
The one part we never think about, the apple butthole.

19:45.440 --> 19:46.240
Yes.

19:46.240 --> 19:50.960
I've learned that the less you like a food, the better it is for you.

19:51.600 --> 19:54.080
And I really don't like eating the stem.

19:54.640 --> 20:00.320
So I have to assume that motherfucker's just packed with vitamins and nutrients.

20:00.320 --> 20:01.840
And protein.

20:02.480 --> 20:07.120
I would like to go on record right now and say I would like to label from now on everyone,

20:07.120 --> 20:10.000
everyone in the world, because everyone in the world listens to this show.

20:10.640 --> 20:10.960
Right.

20:10.960 --> 20:14.640
From now on, I would like to refer to the apple asshole as the applejack.

20:16.000 --> 20:19.200
Let's just establish that that's what an applejack is.

20:19.200 --> 20:20.080
Okay.

20:20.080 --> 20:26.000
So you want to call the butthole the applejack.

20:26.000 --> 20:26.240
Yeah.

20:26.240 --> 20:30.800
And now is this going to be, I know the answer already, but are people going to start referring

20:30.800 --> 20:33.280
to their own buttholes as an applejack?

20:33.280 --> 20:33.760
Yeah.

20:33.760 --> 20:35.520
I mean, that is how language evolves.

20:35.520 --> 20:38.080
It starts with the apples, it goes to the humans.

20:38.080 --> 20:39.120
That's how it's always been.

20:39.840 --> 20:40.080
Yeah.

20:40.880 --> 20:44.640
Now I feel like I need to step in here because it's contractually obligated.

20:44.640 --> 20:47.360
And if I don't, I will hear about it.

20:47.360 --> 20:49.520
One time I ate a banana funny.

20:49.520 --> 20:51.840
I don't literally know anything else to say about it.

20:51.840 --> 20:56.240
But if I didn't say that, then I would get tweets, how you not talk about the banana

20:56.240 --> 20:57.200
you ate funny.

20:57.200 --> 20:57.680
And I know-

20:57.680 --> 20:59.040
One time Griffin ate a banana funny.

20:59.040 --> 21:01.120
And I already mentioned mango too, so I'm cool.

21:01.120 --> 21:04.960
Yeah, so Justin, you got any stuff for your brand that you need to sort of dump in here?

21:04.960 --> 21:05.520
Or else-

21:05.520 --> 21:08.400
Regarding sort of like brands and fruits.

21:08.400 --> 21:13.840
Yeah, have you ever said anything funny about apples or fruit or eating ass or anything?

21:19.440 --> 21:23.840
I mean, there was the one man show about how much I like grapes.

21:24.400 --> 21:29.040
And if I remember correctly, it was called I Love Grapes because I wanted to get it out.

21:29.680 --> 21:32.880
Well, if I remember the working title was Grape Expectations.

21:32.880 --> 21:36.480
And I thought that that was a real chuckle.

21:36.480 --> 21:37.680
I really love that one.

21:38.400 --> 21:43.520
If I remember correctly, though, the full title was Grape Expectations bracket eating ass.

21:45.840 --> 21:46.320
Yeah.

21:46.320 --> 21:49.600
Well, the director of that, Boz, he thought that I-

21:51.040 --> 21:52.160
Sorry, you're Lerman though.

21:53.040 --> 21:53.520
Or Justin.

21:53.520 --> 21:54.480
Skaggs, Skaggs.

21:54.480 --> 22:06.640
He thought that people would be confused about if it was completely about grapes

22:06.640 --> 22:11.600
or some about grapes and some about Charles Dickens.

22:11.600 --> 22:13.200
So he thought that it was just like, I love grapes.

22:13.200 --> 22:14.720
Because Charles Dickens loved eating ass.

22:15.280 --> 22:19.840
Yeah, he also tried to get me to make Lito shuffle the intro, outro,

22:19.840 --> 22:23.120
and sort of all throughout underneath very quiet.

22:23.120 --> 22:25.200
And I said, Boz, I love the tune.

22:25.200 --> 22:28.640
It may be too much of the Lito shuffle.

22:29.760 --> 22:32.160
Now, is that a song that Boz Skaggs did?

22:32.160 --> 22:33.120
Yeah, you gotta tell us.

22:33.120 --> 22:35.840
Oh, man, it's a heat rock trap.

22:35.840 --> 22:37.360
You should look it up after we're done here.

22:37.360 --> 22:39.440
You've probably heard it before you didn't realize it was called that.

22:39.440 --> 22:40.880
Anyway, I need some advice.

22:40.880 --> 22:42.800
Two years ago, my husband and I bought a house.

22:42.800 --> 22:43.600
Congratulations.

22:43.600 --> 22:47.440
The neighbors are very nice, but they have a hearse parked in the driveway.

22:48.320 --> 22:50.720
Initially, we didn't really mind the hearse.

22:50.720 --> 22:53.440
However, it has not started in two years,

22:53.440 --> 22:57.840
and it is attracting unwanted attention, gawkers, weirdos.

22:57.840 --> 22:58.800
And some of the neighbors-

22:58.800 --> 23:01.440
Unwanted from you, question asker.

23:01.440 --> 23:01.920
Guaranteed not from her son.

23:01.920 --> 23:03.280
They may be dying for it.

23:04.640 --> 23:06.880
Several other neighbors are trying to sell their houses

23:06.880 --> 23:08.640
and have complained about the hearse.

23:08.640 --> 23:11.600
Before you ask, yes, there is a coffin in the back.

23:11.600 --> 23:12.720
Oh, shit.

23:12.720 --> 23:14.640
Our neighbor loves this thing.

23:14.640 --> 23:16.480
He has it parked in the middle of his driveway.

23:16.480 --> 23:21.520
He is unable to park either his family's nice, drivable new cars

23:21.520 --> 23:24.800
in the driveway because of this horseless death carriage.

23:24.800 --> 23:27.920
How do we ask him to move his beloved mortician mobile

23:27.920 --> 23:30.720
up the driveway outside?

23:34.720 --> 23:35.760
Frequent listeners.

23:35.760 --> 23:36.400
That's their name.

23:36.400 --> 23:37.600
That's from frequent listeners.

23:38.800 --> 23:41.520
P.S. The plot thickens.

23:41.520 --> 23:44.960
He has started playing an organ very late at night,

23:44.960 --> 23:47.040
but only on Sundays.

23:47.040 --> 23:48.320
What the fuck?

23:48.320 --> 23:49.440
No, here's the thing.

23:49.440 --> 23:50.640
Here's the thing.

23:50.640 --> 23:51.520
Here's the thing.

23:52.320 --> 23:53.520
What's the thing?

23:53.520 --> 23:54.400
Give me the thing,

23:54.400 --> 23:57.840
because I would love a thing to cling to right now.

23:57.840 --> 24:01.680
This person is leaning into this, like, persona, right?

24:01.680 --> 24:04.000
And so any complaining you do,

24:04.000 --> 24:06.400
or like, this is off-putting, people are staring.

24:06.400 --> 24:07.520
That's what they want.

24:08.400 --> 24:13.200
You need to play up how, like, how, like, kind of blah it is.

24:13.200 --> 24:16.080
Like, ah, a hearse in the driveway.

24:16.080 --> 24:18.160
Yeah, no, all over town now.

24:18.160 --> 24:20.160
Like, it has to not be-

24:20.160 --> 24:22.880
You also have to buy a hearse with a coffin in the back

24:22.880 --> 24:23.520
and park it.

24:24.080 --> 24:26.560
You've got to make having a hearse seem like,

24:27.520 --> 24:29.760
you know, having like a funny shaped mailbox.

24:30.720 --> 24:31.200
You know?

24:31.200 --> 24:32.160
Everybody's got one.

24:32.160 --> 24:33.120
Everyone's got one.

24:33.120 --> 24:34.160
Oh, a hearse.

24:34.160 --> 24:34.880
That's cute.

24:34.880 --> 24:37.440
Yeah, I was just reading in Vogue

24:37.440 --> 24:39.120
about how everyone's got a hearse.

24:39.120 --> 24:39.760
You know what I mean?

24:39.760 --> 24:43.120
Something like, oh, this is so normal now.

24:43.120 --> 24:45.760
Does, real quick, does everybody have a funny shaped mailbox?

24:46.320 --> 24:47.120
I thought it was just me.

24:47.120 --> 24:48.560
I got one that looks like an Applejack.

24:49.680 --> 24:52.560
And you got to kind of blast it right in there.

24:52.560 --> 24:53.060
Yeah.

24:54.320 --> 24:56.560
So other possibility, lazy vampire.

24:57.200 --> 24:58.080
I'll get to it.

24:58.640 --> 25:00.560
You got to get that fucking coffin in the house.

25:00.560 --> 25:03.680
We bought it, along with the hearse, to transport it.

25:03.680 --> 25:05.280
And I'm sleepy.

25:05.280 --> 25:07.280
I haven't got a wink in a long time.

25:07.280 --> 25:09.120
I need somewhere to post up.

25:09.120 --> 25:11.920
Maybe that's for when he's fighting with his vampire husband.

25:13.600 --> 25:14.160
You know what?

25:15.840 --> 25:17.600
I'm going to sleep in the car.

25:17.600 --> 25:18.000
Yeah.

25:18.000 --> 25:18.800
Fine.

25:18.800 --> 25:19.280
Fine.

25:19.280 --> 25:19.680
Fine.

25:19.680 --> 25:20.240
Oh, wait.

25:20.240 --> 25:20.720
Hold on.

25:20.720 --> 25:21.280
I got to wait.

25:21.280 --> 25:22.000
Sun setting.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.640
But in like five minutes.

25:24.640 --> 25:26.640
In five minutes, I'm going to storm right out of here.

25:28.160 --> 25:31.360
There's definitely not a body in there, right?

25:32.080 --> 25:32.800
Definitely not.

25:32.800 --> 25:34.320
No, I mean, legally speaking.

25:34.320 --> 25:35.440
That would be a crime.

25:35.440 --> 25:37.200
Yeah, it's a criminal crime, I guess.

25:37.200 --> 25:44.400
Could you get one of those, you know how Domino's pizza delivery drivers have like the big sign

25:44.400 --> 25:45.360
on top?

25:45.360 --> 25:48.960
Could you get one of those and permanently affix it to the top of the hearse when he's

25:48.960 --> 25:49.760
not looking?

25:49.760 --> 25:50.480
Of Domino's?

25:51.280 --> 25:56.960
Like get a Domino's pizza delivery sign and affix it to the top of the hearse permanently.

25:57.520 --> 25:59.760
Because that, I think, is going to mute.

25:59.760 --> 26:03.840
That is something anybody would like to have in their neighborhood, because that's hilarious.

26:03.840 --> 26:06.000
So wait, you're telling me?

26:06.000 --> 26:06.500
Yeah.

26:06.500 --> 26:10.560
We're probably going to be selling our house here in the next few months or so.

26:10.560 --> 26:16.720
You're telling me if I go over to my neighbor's house and permanently affix a Domino's pizza

26:17.520 --> 26:20.720
sort of beacon on top of their car.

26:21.280 --> 26:21.920
Yeah, yep.

26:21.920 --> 26:25.840
It will drive up the property value of every other house on the street because everybody

26:25.840 --> 26:30.000
wants to live next to the Domino's pizza car because then they think, boy, if I order Domino's,

26:30.000 --> 26:31.760
it'll be here in like four seconds.

26:31.760 --> 26:33.920
No, I think they'll think they want to.

26:33.920 --> 26:37.200
They don't want to live next to a Domino's pizza delivery car.

26:37.200 --> 26:41.360
They want to live next to the pizza hearse because, yes, that's amazing.

26:41.360 --> 26:44.560
That's how you get on Atlas Obscura right there.

26:44.560 --> 26:45.440
Thank you, Travis.

26:45.440 --> 26:46.960
Yes, absolutely.

26:47.520 --> 26:50.160
Oh, you got to go see the pizza hearse.

26:50.160 --> 26:51.600
So we didn't talk about organ.

26:52.720 --> 26:54.640
The organ bit is something.

26:54.640 --> 26:56.160
On Sundays.

26:56.160 --> 27:02.400
Well, there's a very vital piece of information missing, which is what kind of music is he

27:02.400 --> 27:03.040
playing?

27:03.040 --> 27:06.640
Is it like scary family opera music or is he just doing like covers?

27:08.080 --> 27:12.560
Maybe he's doing a soundtrack for his family watching the football game that evening.

27:13.200 --> 27:14.160
They watch the silent.

27:14.160 --> 27:17.280
They got the silent reel and he has to play along.

27:17.840 --> 27:22.480
They got a silent TV and he plays along to sort of in company and then every once in a while

27:22.480 --> 27:26.720
he'll write what he thinks the announcers are saying on a card and hold it up in front

27:26.720 --> 27:27.120
of the screen.

27:27.120 --> 27:28.800
You did football bad.

27:28.800 --> 27:29.840
Minus 10 feet.

27:30.400 --> 27:32.480
I mean, you got to park them somewhere.

27:32.480 --> 27:34.000
I think we can all agree on that.

27:34.000 --> 27:37.360
Hearse has got to go somewhere that you don't just build a hearse every time you got to

27:37.360 --> 27:38.320
do a funeral.

27:38.320 --> 27:43.600
And it doesn't sound like he's it starts necessarily like it's not working.

27:43.600 --> 27:45.200
It sounds like to me, right?

27:45.760 --> 27:47.200
It's like malfunctioned.

27:47.200 --> 27:50.640
You brought up that he's got it parked in the middle of the driveway so the other cars

27:50.640 --> 27:51.760
can't get in the driveway.

27:51.760 --> 27:56.000
But I would not, I think, want to confront this reminder.

27:56.000 --> 28:02.400
This is grim reminder every time I had to hop in the ride to head to target in the life

28:02.400 --> 28:07.040
whip, you know what I don't want to get in my living whip and look over into the death

28:07.040 --> 28:12.080
whip every time I every time I had to go to the, you know, get my waxing done.

28:12.080 --> 28:17.520
And that's fair because they also like it would be I actually think weirder if you parked

28:17.520 --> 28:22.560
the cars there just because contextually that would be weird because then you're not setting

28:22.560 --> 28:26.880
the hearse apart as like, look at this oddity I have parked in my driveway.

28:26.880 --> 28:29.920
Then it just becomes like another car I have.

28:29.920 --> 28:37.360
And that's far weirder to me if it was like, there's my Subaru, there's my Toyota, and

28:37.360 --> 28:39.040
there's my death car.

28:39.040 --> 28:41.600
What's the brand of the death car?

28:41.600 --> 28:47.680
Is it like a really is it just like a long extended cab Hyundai Elantra?

28:47.680 --> 28:49.520
Like, it's got to have a brand, right?

28:49.520 --> 28:51.120
Is it like Ford?

28:51.120 --> 28:55.120
Is it like Ford Ford Ford built Ford tough.

28:55.120 --> 28:58.880
It's the Ford boat to cross the river stick.

28:58.880 --> 29:01.960
The last ride you'll ever need Ford.

29:01.960 --> 29:03.280
That's a very good question.

29:03.280 --> 29:05.480
Who's making these dang things?

29:05.480 --> 29:08.000
Who's making these things?

29:08.000 --> 29:09.000
I don't want to know.

29:09.000 --> 29:10.000
Don't tweet at me.

29:10.000 --> 29:11.000
Yeah, please don't let me know.

29:11.000 --> 29:12.000
Please don't.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.000
Please don't tweet about hearses.

29:13.000 --> 29:14.000
I will.

29:14.000 --> 29:15.000
I do want to say this.

29:15.000 --> 29:17.320
I'm assuming there was not a picture attached to this travel.

29:17.320 --> 29:18.320
It was not.

29:18.320 --> 29:19.320
No.

29:19.320 --> 29:23.840
People if you're gonna if you're in a situation like this where it would be very easy to please

29:23.840 --> 29:27.800
just go ahead and snap a pic and you know, let us know if it could be publicly serviced

29:27.800 --> 29:28.800
or not.

29:28.800 --> 29:31.000
The answer is almost always probably no.

29:31.000 --> 29:32.860
But go ahead and include that pic.

29:32.860 --> 29:38.080
That's sort of get a better like just send a pic because I feel differently.

29:38.080 --> 29:44.400
I feel differently about this if it's like a rusted out Hulk versus like a shining beautiful

29:44.400 --> 29:49.080
sleek black brand new looking take real good care of right.

29:49.080 --> 29:50.080
That's the case.

29:50.080 --> 29:53.100
Exhibit has gotten his hands on this hearse.

29:53.100 --> 29:57.840
Maybe your neighbors planning to do like ghost tours at some point.

29:57.840 --> 30:01.400
They just haven't really gotten their shit together enough to figure out where the ghosts

30:01.400 --> 30:04.120
are because that's one of the important things.

30:04.120 --> 30:09.040
You don't want to be telling a bunch of cockamamie tales about the locales of ghosts.

30:09.040 --> 30:13.300
You want to make sure you know where they are so it's a legit tour because the critics

30:13.300 --> 30:17.160
will come and they'll tear you apart if it's ghost free locations, you know?

30:17.160 --> 30:19.920
Yeah and I mean it's probably definitely a grave robber.

30:19.920 --> 30:21.240
Should we do a money zone?

30:21.240 --> 30:25.840
Well I real quick can I tell a hearse related Travis anecdote very quickly?

30:25.840 --> 30:30.920
Oh I love your Travis anecdote and especially about hearse.

30:30.920 --> 30:35.320
In 10th grade we were assigned a writing assignment that was like what would you do after high

30:35.320 --> 30:39.140
school if you suddenly had a bunch of money and we had to write like where the money would

30:39.140 --> 30:45.320
come from and what it would be and I was super into the idea of monster hunting at the time.

30:45.320 --> 30:49.640
So that's what I said I would do- I remember this fucking report you wrote.

30:49.640 --> 30:54.260
I would get a hearse and I'd put a motorcycle in the back in case I need the motorcycle

30:54.260 --> 30:56.620
and the hearse, I don't know- Definitely not legal.

30:56.620 --> 30:57.620
Probably not legal.

30:57.620 --> 31:01.760
No definitely not legal but I guess in my head I was picturing the motorcycle ejecting

31:01.760 --> 31:03.560
out the back of the hearse whenever I needed it.

31:03.560 --> 31:09.040
The hearse immediately veering off the road and exploding because nobody's driving.

31:09.040 --> 31:13.220
But now I have my motorcycle and everything's fine and I wrote about like going to the Winchester

31:13.220 --> 31:17.560
house and finding out no in fact it wasn't haunted but there were vampires there.

31:17.560 --> 31:23.440
Anyways so I turned this in and the teacher was like well I can't fault the writing but

31:23.440 --> 31:27.560
this was supposed to be like in real life what would you do?

31:27.560 --> 31:32.680
And I think I wrote that I would have gotten the money from my family dying in a very mysterious

31:32.680 --> 31:33.680
way.

31:33.680 --> 31:37.100
So I was also hunting that and she was like- Glad we got uh glad we got to be involved

31:37.100 --> 31:38.100
Trav there.

31:38.100 --> 31:41.920
Yeah glad we got in there in the margins and in the text crawl at the beginning of the

31:41.920 --> 31:42.920
film.

31:42.920 --> 31:48.400
Well Nessie survived the Scottish Terrier and she traveled with me to help me hunt ghosts

31:48.400 --> 31:54.840
and you know in retrospect uh I actually think that is what I would have done uh had I uh

31:54.840 --> 31:58.240
you know not gone on to college and if my family had all died mysteriously and given

31:58.240 --> 31:59.240
me thousands of dollars.

31:59.240 --> 32:00.240
Oh sorry to disappoint you there Trav.

32:00.240 --> 32:01.240
Sorry I'm still thinking.

32:01.240 --> 32:02.240
Yeah sorry bud.

32:02.240 --> 32:04.400
Well you know you all really let me down.

32:04.400 --> 32:11.320
That teacher Eric Kripke took your shit, made supernatural, made like a billion dollars.

32:11.320 --> 32:12.320
Yeah I don't want to talk about it.

32:12.320 --> 32:13.320
Yeah I know.

32:13.320 --> 32:14.320
They're always trying.

32:14.320 --> 32:15.320
They're always trying to get you and Eric got you good on this one.

32:15.320 --> 32:18.200
I keep giving away these movie ideas, TV show ideas.

32:18.200 --> 32:19.200
Yeah.

32:19.200 --> 32:22.840
Griffin um Griffin mentioned supernatural so I've got to delete my Twitter account real

32:22.840 --> 32:26.560
quick.

32:26.560 --> 32:33.760
In the interim let's go to the money zone.

32:33.760 --> 32:44.680
Well I get home from a hard day at the office and what do I see as I pull into my driveway?

32:44.680 --> 32:46.600
A large box.

32:46.600 --> 32:47.600
Oh a hearse?

32:47.600 --> 32:48.600
I don't remember.

32:48.600 --> 32:49.600
Coffin.

32:49.600 --> 32:50.600
I don't remember I don't remember ordering anything.

32:50.600 --> 32:52.840
I tear it open.

32:52.840 --> 32:55.640
Not the way you're supposed to open it just like start ripping into it because I'm so

32:55.640 --> 32:56.640
curious.

32:56.640 --> 32:58.400
You know what's in there?

32:58.400 --> 33:01.240
Beautiful bouquet from uh Pro Flowers.

33:01.240 --> 33:02.240
Oh okay.

33:02.240 --> 33:04.560
Is this a real story or sort of a dream quest you're going on?

33:04.560 --> 33:09.200
No this is a true story that happened to me and I thought boy somebody must love me very

33:09.200 --> 33:11.040
much I felt so special.

33:11.040 --> 33:15.400
I did read the card and it's like we're excited about the ad campaign it's like well that's

33:15.400 --> 33:20.160
sweet but you all do have a lot of flowers so it's not like you're hurting for them but

33:20.160 --> 33:22.160
I did appreciate the gesture.

33:22.160 --> 33:27.000
There were some berries in there too but if you want to make a big uh impression on somebody

33:27.000 --> 33:31.600
why not try Pro Flowers it's the perfect way.

33:31.600 --> 33:35.240
Pro Flowers thought inside the box so you can too.

33:35.240 --> 33:39.560
Your flowers are boxed fresh and delivered fast so that they will last surprisingly longer

33:39.560 --> 33:40.640
seven days at least.

33:40.640 --> 33:44.680
I gotta say the ones I got were about a week ago uh if not more and they're looking great

33:44.680 --> 33:47.820
and you know the cool thing about Pro Flowers when they show up it's really it's really

33:47.820 --> 33:54.920
easy and not annoying to get it like looking great you just there's a vase included you

33:54.920 --> 33:55.920
tear off the plastic wrapping.

33:55.920 --> 33:56.920

horror action sci-fi fantasy bizarro and exploitation cinema mothers lock up your sons because the

39:35.760 --> 39:41.300
switchblade sisters are coming for you available at maximum fun org or wherever you find your

39:41.300 --> 39:49.480
podcasts i have a yahoo here and i wish we would have done it right after the last question

39:49.480 --> 39:53.360
um but it was sent in by level 9 000 yadru drew a drew java port thank you drew it's

39:53.360 --> 39:58.480
from yahoo answers use her anonymous which is good because they're about to do a crime

39:58.480 --> 40:07.160
but we'll call him raj asks if someone behaves like a vampire uh-huh and i think they might

40:07.160 --> 40:13.480
really be a vampire uh-huh then am i allowed to break into the house whoa to see if it

40:13.480 --> 40:18.680
sleeps in a coffin legal protections around trespassers are for humans and not vampires

40:18.680 --> 40:23.400
right i also want to hold a mirror in front of it to see if it has they keep using it

40:23.400 --> 40:27.800
that seems yeah let's go with they yeah i also want to hold a mirror in front to see

40:27.800 --> 40:34.600
if they have a reflection and might only feel doing a safe doing so whilst they are asleep

40:34.600 --> 40:42.380
um okay let's so what are we trying to ascertain here is this if someone i i think my neighbors

40:42.380 --> 40:47.260
are vampire because they have a fucking hearse in the front yard with a coffin in it am i

40:47.260 --> 40:51.320
legally allowed to break into their house just to see if there's a coffin in there that

40:51.320 --> 40:56.200
a second coffin that they sleep in when they're not fighting with their husband i can i can

40:56.200 --> 41:03.680
answer this for you right now griffin okay okay yeah let's take the on out of undead

41:03.680 --> 41:10.220
and just say your neighbor dies are you allowed to then break into their house no still a

41:10.220 --> 41:18.280
crime well hold on hold on if you suspect they've died oh get in to save them yeah well

41:18.280 --> 41:26.480
save them save them with like some real late but clutch cpr if we're in a world where vampires

41:26.480 --> 41:34.600
exist why can i not do some sort of spell yeah okay um so first of all travis was this

41:34.600 --> 41:38.680
a factor in your report that you did in high school which god please tell me you had to

41:38.680 --> 41:43.720
read that in front of the class please tell me other people our teacher was a very kind

41:43.720 --> 41:52.200
understanding very discreet yeah um this is a high risk high whatever the opposite of

41:52.200 --> 41:58.800
a reward is risk i guess it's a high risk high risk sort of situation because you kick

41:58.800 --> 42:05.680
in the door and either they're all there and they're like when they're eating like a you

42:05.680 --> 42:11.200
know they're eating a salad and you're like oh that's not a vampire dracula never get

42:11.200 --> 42:16.000
caught dead eating lettuce and that's a fun joke even that in of itself because he is

42:16.000 --> 42:21.800
technically dead and then you would go to jail for probably a bit um and actually i

42:21.800 --> 42:26.960
don't know if you just kick in the door is is it still breaking and entering if you just

42:26.960 --> 42:31.040
sort of break but don't enter well here okay but there's another side of this right would

42:31.040 --> 42:35.120
they press charges because if this person is really trying to live that vampire lifestyle

42:35.120 --> 42:40.480
and you're like sorry i thought you were a vampire wouldn't they be a little flattered

42:40.480 --> 42:46.960
when they'd be a little bit like thank you very much now please leave what if you just

42:46.960 --> 42:52.400
there's easier ways to ascertain this i've griffin mentioned salad knock on the door

42:52.400 --> 42:58.920
asked to borrow a cup of lettuce and and if they have that in their house by weight don't

42:58.920 --> 43:04.600
i wait well you have to because are you packing the lettuce in the cup all right you know

43:04.600 --> 43:08.920
what i mean like but you can't give someone a cup of lettuce by weight well i believe

43:08.920 --> 43:14.840
a cup weighs a pound a cup of lettuce weighs a pound okay that's what that's what out in

43:14.840 --> 43:20.000
brown would tell you is that what out in brown person who knows what the fuck lettuce is

43:20.000 --> 43:24.000
would tell me about the weight of lettuce like when they say you know which weighs more

43:24.000 --> 43:28.480
you know a ton of bricks or a ton of lettuce you know they both weigh a ton yeah that's

43:28.480 --> 43:32.620
irrelevant to what i'm saying now if you're making the argument that we in america should

43:32.620 --> 43:38.040
switch to uh using weight measurements for baking specifically i would completely agree

43:38.040 --> 43:43.400
with you it's really criminal that our recipes by and large are delivered to us in the imperfect

43:43.400 --> 43:50.220
system of uh uh sort of like volume measurements i think that that's a very bad way to bake

43:50.220 --> 43:54.440
and whenever possible i prefer to bake by weight because it's much more precise but

43:54.440 --> 44:00.840
a cup of lettuce does not weigh a pound packed it tight enough i think you could yeah you

44:00.840 --> 44:04.200
could make it weigh a pound you think you could pack lettuce tight enough to make it

44:04.200 --> 44:11.120
weigh a pound in a cup yeah okay well so it vampires uh-huh yeah there's a lot of different

44:11.120 --> 44:15.440
things you can do here obviously ask them to come outside in the daylight you can throw

44:15.440 --> 44:19.520
a garlic at them but that in and of itself i think might be a different crime what if

44:19.520 --> 44:24.560
you just made them like a casserole like yes hey welcome to the neighborhood what are you

44:24.560 --> 44:28.520
talking about i've lived here for 10 years yes sorry but i never brought you this garlicky

44:28.520 --> 44:33.800
lasagna well you wouldn't say that would you you wouldn't say garlicky lasagna would you

44:33.800 --> 44:37.600
say that trev well no you would probably just give them lasagna and then check in to see

44:37.600 --> 44:43.600
if they ate and you put like a pound of garlic in there that assumes that anyone human or

44:43.600 --> 44:50.680
a non-human living or undead would eat a casserole baked by a stranger yeah because no never

44:50.680 --> 44:57.400
not thank you so much for this charming gift dump dump it out so the other thing you can

44:57.400 --> 45:04.960
do is go over and say like i just finished this um this magazine this issue of mother

45:04.960 --> 45:11.720
jones do you want to read it and if they say yes not vampire because vampires staunch conservative

45:11.720 --> 45:18.640
and and so that i'm not saying that all of your like staunch conservative neighbors are

45:18.640 --> 45:22.280
vampires but i'm saying probably about half of them are if you can break in and check

45:22.280 --> 45:26.160
their internet history and you see a lot of judge report and info wars on there you might

45:26.160 --> 45:35.160
be dealing with a vampire you might be a vampire finish the thought finish it now if you suspect

45:35.160 --> 45:41.320
that your neighbor is a no i want the accent i want the accent i want three you might be

45:41.320 --> 45:48.960
a vampire if okay delivered in the style of jeff if you're a fan of the xfl you might

45:48.960 --> 45:53.840
be a vampire yeah you're definitely a vampire they're catering to all night games or else

45:53.840 --> 45:59.260
ticket sales are going to be a real problem there two more if you're hers has a papa john's

45:59.260 --> 46:05.740
light on top of it you might be a vampire thank you jeff wolfworthy one more please

46:05.740 --> 46:11.920
give me trab i'm leaning on you on this one i'm i'm pulling out second if you go to church

46:11.920 --> 46:16.280
every sunday even though it burns your skin off you might be does that work is that a

46:16.280 --> 46:20.760
thing well that's something it's kind of a fun one yeah yeah that's a good one i like

46:20.760 --> 46:25.280
that one because i could tell that joke at church and i'm always looking for new jokes

46:25.280 --> 46:29.720
to tell at church i'm gonna work on that one it's hard to come up with funny stuff when

46:29.720 --> 46:35.680
you can't you know cuss or so much anything and griffin's church jokes are great because

46:35.680 --> 46:41.520
they're delivered during the sermon and sort of over it yeah so as yeah outside of it on

46:41.520 --> 46:46.840
a megaphone when he feels like the sermon is in a lull like he's reading a bible verse

46:46.840 --> 46:51.720
or something and like yeah we've all got the bible man thanks yeah it's the time the big

46:51.720 --> 46:57.520
pastors up there and would say something you know like you know the disciple paul and his

46:57.520 --> 47:03.000
letter to the and then just from the audience which is what you call the crowd at a church

47:03.000 --> 47:10.160
you would just hear if you don't finish your garlic lasagna and then i get kicked out again

47:10.160 --> 47:14.600
which you probably don't even realize they will do they'll do that to you if you become

47:14.600 --> 47:18.760
a nuisance you didn't finish the joke so i don't actually know the punchline now you

47:18.760 --> 47:25.320
only started the joke so what would be sort of the rest of it um you might be a redneck

47:25.320 --> 47:29.200
well now that's the other that's jeff foxworthy not jeff wolfworthy no i know but i would

47:29.200 --> 47:34.240
do this justin because it's like a werewolf thing or just because wolf is like fox the

47:34.240 --> 47:40.600
wolf is like fox and also dracula's can change into wolves so that's kind of in the children

47:40.600 --> 47:46.800
of the night listen to the children of the night what beautiful music they make if the

47:46.800 --> 47:51.440
beautiful music your children of the night make is all country western you might be a

47:51.440 --> 47:56.240
vampire now that's good let's go more specific if the beautiful music your children of the

47:56.240 --> 48:03.760
night make is all hank williams senior tunes you might be a vampire hey now what is a man

48:03.760 --> 48:12.960
a miserable pile of secrets but enough have at you might be if your coffin has a big number

48:12.960 --> 48:21.360
three etched in the side you might be a vampire how dare you how dare you justin there's probably

48:21.360 --> 48:26.340
more of these yeah yeah i mean we could probably do a lot but would anybody enjoy it or listen

48:26.340 --> 48:30.800
to it has anyone enjoyed anything we've done so far and i don't just mean in this episode

48:30.800 --> 48:36.440
i mean like in our lives since april 10th 2010 it's impossible to say how about another

48:36.440 --> 48:42.360
question i would love that here it comes i'm currently attending cosmetology school and

48:42.360 --> 48:50.440
i have been for several months now astronauts unfortunately what no unfortunately only

48:50.440 --> 48:55.000
today i've been told our school's graduation ceremony tradition each student on their graduation

48:55.000 --> 48:59.160
day gets to pick a song to come out to in front of everyone and they are seated at the

48:59.160 --> 49:03.640
front of the class and complimented by your teachers and peers it's actually quite lovely

49:03.640 --> 49:08.600
my problem is this i've been cheated out of three months to decide on a song three months

49:08.600 --> 49:13.320
in and they're just now telling me i must choose a song to encapsulate my entire being

49:13.320 --> 49:18.080
a song that will be the soundtrack of my arrival to the professional world a song of glory

49:18.080 --> 49:22.360
of the literal blood sweat and tears i've given to graduate brothers how do i pick the

49:22.360 --> 49:26.760
one perfect song that will escort me into the cold embrace of adulthood pump up the

49:26.760 --> 49:31.240
rest of my class for graduation and will represent the essence of me this is the most important

49:31.240 --> 49:35.080
decision of my life also due to an incident that no one will fucking tell me about no

49:35.080 --> 49:40.360
one is allowed to choose party rock anthem thank you thank you for ruling that out bewildered

49:40.360 --> 49:44.560
and beauty school and thank you also for not including any relevant details about yourself

49:44.560 --> 49:49.120
whatsoever that we could use because that definitely does make it easier um well let's

49:49.120 --> 49:55.080
work backwards let's memento this one what happened with party rock right does that one

49:55.080 --> 50:00.480
have foul lyrics in it that maybe they it came on and all the cool professors were like

50:00.480 --> 50:06.480
nice but then there's a part where lmfao is like you know talking about the their apple

50:06.480 --> 50:12.440
jacks or something like that and people are like uh it's crude this this is a big school

50:12.440 --> 50:18.920
i'm i'm currently reviewing um the the tune on genius lyrics which is it seems like they

50:18.920 --> 50:24.280
should have another dough name yeah yeah this is one of my uh just weird facts that i know

50:24.280 --> 50:29.920
about sports and it's not even really directly about sports but there is a cincinnati reds

50:29.920 --> 50:32.960
player i don't even know if he still plays but he was the third baseman his name was

50:32.960 --> 50:37.320
scott rollin um and you know baseball players get to pick their own walkout music when they

50:37.320 --> 50:43.280
walk up to uh to take you know they're at bat and so scott rollin just let his daughter

50:43.280 --> 50:48.320
pick and so like she always picked like justin bieber and like taylor swift and stuff and

50:48.320 --> 50:52.080
that was just like his walkout music and i just think that like that's the best that's

50:52.080 --> 50:56.880
just really fun to me and i just really enjoyed that fact and i wanted to share it with everybody

50:56.880 --> 51:01.840
yeah it's not funny but it's you know nice yeah you can tell that joke at church you

51:01.840 --> 51:07.080
know i could definitely get in front of the crowd during the sermon and do that one it's

51:07.080 --> 51:11.080
kind of a bummer that i can never release an album because the best name for an album

51:11.080 --> 51:15.560
sorry for party rocking is already taken it's already been done and it's nice that they

51:15.560 --> 51:19.320
understand that they have made a mistake wouldn't it be i think it would be better though if

51:19.320 --> 51:26.600
that album wasn't by lmfao it's just like listen i travis mcgraw on behalf of all music

51:26.600 --> 51:33.340
apologize for party rocking all right what's the song what's the song this is interesting

51:33.340 --> 51:40.880
because like you could pick a song that encapsulates you or you could pick pick like an aspirational

51:40.880 --> 51:49.200
song like a song that i like don't stop me now you know is a song of like this is me

51:49.200 --> 51:53.680
this is the me i want to be i mean that's a good answer that's a good answer but it's

51:53.680 --> 51:58.880
not the best answer okay i think i mean you get up there and you do don't stop me now

51:58.880 --> 52:02.960
but just do that one if we say nothing else that is better just do that one because that

52:02.960 --> 52:06.520
is a very good one i think that's going to get the crowd very psyched what's the best

52:06.520 --> 52:14.480
answer though what if you do the graduation song you know the pomp and circumstance okay

52:14.480 --> 52:21.080
i thought you meant as we go either one is fine it's something to placate those fascist

52:21.080 --> 52:28.040
teachers up on our teachers our national treasure a fascist up on stage and then what's that

52:28.040 --> 52:33.760
record scratch and then what's the weather you hear from coming from the crowd party

52:33.760 --> 52:39.920
rock is in the house tonight it's an acapella version you've worked with the entire school

52:39.920 --> 52:43.600
to do the entire thing so what the fuck are they gonna do kick you out no you already

52:43.600 --> 52:46.940
got that piece of paper actually wait till you get the piece of paper yeah because once

52:46.940 --> 52:52.240
that happens that's a legally binding you graduated and now you can't take that from

52:52.240 --> 52:59.240
you no uh you get that and then that's the record scratch noise and that's how they make

52:59.240 --> 53:03.080
it and then coming from the crowd is party rock in the house tonight everybody's gonna

53:03.080 --> 53:09.220
have a good time and you kind of do like stop like you're like wave like putting your hands

53:09.220 --> 53:13.960
like please no i'm not allowed and they're and they're like we're sorry for party rocking

53:13.960 --> 53:19.280
and and then you like join in and then the teachers are like why did we ban this fucking

53:19.280 --> 53:25.660
tune yeah because we're into it and then you start dancing you're dancing and the small

53:25.660 --> 53:31.400
town priest is like oh you know what this is actually flying yeah he takes off his vestments

53:31.400 --> 53:35.460
and you know he's wearing like you know hot pants and a rave shirt and he's like ready

53:35.460 --> 53:41.600
he's ready to go and then it could be a big food fight oh that would be so great and you're

53:41.600 --> 53:46.360
all just doing each other's hair and getting ready to blast off into space and then red

53:46.360 --> 53:51.680
foo and sky blue stand up and they're like hi this is over yeah we're back and they do

53:51.680 --> 53:59.200
a sequel to the song right there still sorry for party rock yes and listen we can't apologize

53:59.200 --> 54:05.840
enough for party rock okay and this one's gonna be even more contrite can i tell you

54:05.840 --> 54:11.480
something i'm looking at the lyrics of party rock anthem there's very little apology happening

54:11.480 --> 54:16.760
here yeah they're not even sorry for party rocking really yeah so it seems like they're

54:16.760 --> 54:21.520
kind of celebrating it and if they really wanted me to believe their bullshit apology

54:21.520 --> 54:26.200
they would have a little little something in here this is like there is an entire song

54:26.200 --> 54:30.920
oh called sorry for party rocking which i think might be better more palatable in terms

54:30.920 --> 54:35.120
of apologies okay i'm looking at the lyrics of this one they do actually say sorry for

54:35.120 --> 54:39.280
party rocking actually a lot in this one so it's a difference on a lot of that i'm looking

54:39.280 --> 54:43.520
at it they say it about 32 times so that's a good song as far as i can tell just look

54:43.520 --> 54:50.320
because it gets the message across yeah that they did it bad so that could work uh bang

54:50.320 --> 54:57.440
a rang by skrillex bang a ring but you can't come out to the drop yeah yeah and that takes

54:57.440 --> 55:02.800
a little while uh it takes a while to get there you have to be done before the drop

55:02.800 --> 55:08.040
so it's just like oh oh go go go go is there a song that has the drop at the beginning

55:08.040 --> 55:13.040
of it and that might be the antithesis of it but i would love it if you know skrillex

55:13.040 --> 55:19.000
was like i got a new song here comes wow and then it's like whoa thank you i didn't have

55:19.000 --> 55:22.800
to wait at all you just sort of hit me up front with that and it's weird you didn't

55:22.800 --> 55:26.540
really build up a lot of anticipation and then everything that came after that was actually

55:26.540 --> 55:32.000
pretty disappointing um it's just down to is there a song that has the drop at the very

55:32.000 --> 55:41.000
end of it that's just like for like four and a half minutes and it's like and that's the

55:41.000 --> 55:45.560
end of the song and it's like oh man i don't know if that would be satisfying either griffin

55:45.560 --> 55:52.080
i don't think edm is sort of your future what about a song that's all drops and so it opens

55:52.080 --> 56:00.000
