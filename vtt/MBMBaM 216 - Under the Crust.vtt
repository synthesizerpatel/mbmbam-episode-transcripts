WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:46.720 --> 00:55.520
Are you ready for some podcast about fantasy football? My name is Justin McElroy,

00:55.520 --> 00:59.680
and I got Travis and Griffin, and we're ready to get some football.

01:00.880 --> 01:05.600
Make sure the laces are out like in Ace Ventura, because it's time to talk some fantasy.

01:05.600 --> 01:09.360
That's your touchstone? That's your athletic touchstone?

01:09.360 --> 01:12.000
It's amazing that we got Miranda Lambert to write that song for us.

01:12.000 --> 01:12.800
I know.

01:12.800 --> 01:14.480
Fantasy football time is here again.

01:14.480 --> 01:15.760
The greatest time of the year.

01:15.760 --> 01:17.360
All your Sunday night buddies are back.

01:19.680 --> 01:20.800
Randy Moss.

01:20.800 --> 01:21.600
Brad Pennington.

01:22.640 --> 01:23.520
Johnny United.

01:23.520 --> 01:23.920
Perry.

01:24.800 --> 01:26.080
Sergeant Slaughter.

01:26.080 --> 01:29.040
The Orc one from Mutant Football League.

01:30.080 --> 01:32.160
How does everybody like their fantasy chances this year?

01:32.160 --> 01:35.120
We are again in our dad's league, protective cup of soup.

01:36.320 --> 01:44.320
My team, Touchdown to Nabi, is back again with the Archer Countess leading the team to victory.

01:44.320 --> 01:51.200
My team, the Flying Moranite, we got the second place last year, and I feel pretty good.

01:51.200 --> 01:55.440
I feel pretty good about my chances, if everybody doesn't blow it.

01:55.440 --> 02:03.840
I mean, I won last year's league with my team, Gridiron and Wine, a replacement name for the

02:03.840 --> 02:06.880
Mario Lopez dispenser, because I wanted some football in there.

02:08.240 --> 02:11.440
But how do I feel about my chances? Poor, very poor.

02:11.440 --> 02:16.160
I did a great draft, but I mean, I don't think God's gonna let me win this one twice,

02:16.160 --> 02:16.720
you know what I mean?

02:17.520 --> 02:18.960
He's very malevolent.

02:18.960 --> 02:20.960
He's a vengeful football god.

02:22.320 --> 02:23.920
I'm in three leagues this year.

02:24.880 --> 02:25.760
It's far too many.

02:27.760 --> 02:29.120
Did you start a league, Griffin?

02:29.120 --> 02:31.280
Travis, are you the commish on a league?

02:31.280 --> 02:37.360
I am the half-assed league, because I started the league and then forgot to get any players.

02:37.360 --> 02:40.000
So I filled a 12-person league in one day.

02:40.000 --> 02:46.640
So tell me this, because you told me the contents, the constituent makeup of this league,

02:46.640 --> 02:50.880
and it sounded to me like you kind of just wanted to win a fantasy football league,

02:50.880 --> 02:54.560
and so you got a bunch of people together who didn't know what the fuck they were doing.

02:54.560 --> 02:57.120
It literally could not be a more random assortment of humans,

02:57.120 --> 03:00.400
and if you just like threw a water balloon into a DMV line,

03:00.400 --> 03:02.240
and whoever got doused was on your team.

03:02.240 --> 03:05.040
I would say that there's a healthy number.

03:05.040 --> 03:08.640
What I tried to get was a balance of people who knew a lot about football

03:08.640 --> 03:10.320
and had played fantasy football before.

03:10.320 --> 03:11.840
Like Lin-Manuel Miranda.

03:11.840 --> 03:16.320
Well, and people who didn't, but were excited to try it out,

03:16.320 --> 03:23.280
and I wanted to give them a safe environment in which to try their first round of fantasy football.

03:23.280 --> 03:26.960
Did you Buffalo Lin-Manuel Miranda into your fantasy football?

03:26.960 --> 03:29.200
He was the first one to sign up.

03:29.200 --> 03:30.880
He was so excited about it.

03:31.440 --> 03:32.640
He's an excitable dude.

03:32.640 --> 03:34.720
I just don't want you to bully him.

03:34.720 --> 03:37.440
I think what it is is he's got the Emmy.

03:37.440 --> 03:39.520
He's got the Emmy, he's got the Tony.

03:39.520 --> 03:42.000
Now he needs whatever bullshit trophy I buy at a thrift store.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.360
He's got a Grammy too, dog.

03:43.360 --> 03:44.560
And a Grammy, yeah.

03:44.560 --> 03:46.880
He just needs that fantasy football trophy.

03:46.880 --> 03:47.840
That's the one.

03:47.840 --> 03:51.120
That's the one acclaim that has escaped him.

03:51.120 --> 03:52.480
He's trying to get an e-golf.

03:54.160 --> 03:54.660
Yep.

03:55.600 --> 03:56.480
This could be his year.

03:57.280 --> 04:00.640
Maybe finally he can accomplish something and make his family proud.

04:00.640 --> 04:01.360
Yeah, finally.

04:05.440 --> 04:07.200
So fantasy football is here.

04:07.200 --> 04:12.880
We're going to be taking your calls throughout the show, asking for our advice on which players

04:12.880 --> 04:14.400
to start, which players to stop.

04:16.480 --> 04:22.320
Which players had a happy week, which players are feeling a little blue, which players are

04:22.320 --> 04:24.560
cat people, which ones are dog people.

04:24.560 --> 04:26.720
And which ones have flubber.

04:26.720 --> 04:27.220
Yep.

04:30.720 --> 04:32.960
They are cracking down on flubber really hard.

04:32.960 --> 04:33.520
Really?

04:33.520 --> 04:34.160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:34.160 --> 04:35.680
That's why Josh Gordon was out.

04:35.680 --> 04:37.120
It's head to head tackles.

04:37.120 --> 04:38.640
They're looking out for concussions.

04:38.640 --> 04:46.480
They're looking out for wife beating, of course, and also flubber in that order.

04:46.480 --> 04:49.280
That's the order of importance to the ESPN.

04:49.280 --> 04:50.720
The ESPN, the NFL.

04:50.720 --> 04:51.840
Sorry, the ESPN?

04:52.880 --> 04:55.440
Is that the league that is the governing body?

04:55.440 --> 04:57.520
The Extrasensory Perception Network.

04:57.520 --> 04:58.240
Let's move on.

04:58.240 --> 04:59.680
They can feel the flubber.

04:59.680 --> 05:00.960
Let's go ahead and move on.

05:00.960 --> 05:04.400
My friend, who is now also my boss, swears a lot at work.

05:04.400 --> 05:08.560
While it's never directed at his employees specifically, it's usually in ways that feel

05:08.560 --> 05:11.360
overreactive and out of the blue for work conversation.

05:11.360 --> 05:17.520
It's generally shocking and uncomfortable for me and I sense my fellow employees as well.

05:17.520 --> 05:21.360
I strongly compartmentalize work in free time and swearing doesn't usually bother me more

05:21.360 --> 05:22.800
in casual situations.

05:23.520 --> 05:27.600
Do I tell him it bothers me since he's my friend or do I suck it up and deal with it

05:27.600 --> 05:28.560
because he's my boss?

05:29.360 --> 05:33.040
And do I bring it up on or off the clock?

05:33.040 --> 05:35.040
God, all these are so good.

05:35.040 --> 05:36.720
In Chicago, that's a great question.

05:36.720 --> 05:37.360
Is it good?

05:38.080 --> 05:38.960
Here's my question.

05:38.960 --> 05:42.240
Because I've had this personal debate for a while now.

05:42.240 --> 05:46.320
I feel like, listen, I'm totally down with cursing.

05:46.320 --> 05:47.280
I do it a lot.

05:47.280 --> 05:51.280
But there's something about, there's certain environments where it's so grating to me.

05:51.280 --> 05:58.560
Like if I'm out to eat with friends and someone's telling a story and cussing a bunch, that

05:58.560 --> 05:59.600
doesn't bother me.

05:59.600 --> 06:00.960
Oh, no, that does.

06:00.960 --> 06:03.200
But if I'm in a bar, it doesn't.

06:03.200 --> 06:06.560
So the environmental nature of it really changes.

06:06.560 --> 06:10.080
But if we got it, there's so many layers here.

06:10.080 --> 06:16.240
Because if you're talking about a cuss, this person's doing a cuss in a workplace, a cuss

06:16.240 --> 06:17.920
in a workplace environment, right?

06:18.720 --> 06:21.120
There's a lot of different ways that that can be interpreted.

06:21.120 --> 06:25.920
For instance, if he gets back his company's financial report and they had a bad, they

06:25.920 --> 06:31.520
underperformed in the fourth quarter, much like the Green Bay Packers did in their Thursday

06:31.520 --> 06:32.320
night season opener.

06:34.160 --> 06:34.660
Thank you.

06:35.440 --> 06:41.040
If that happens and my boss goes shit, then that's fine.

06:41.040 --> 06:47.040
But if he is just walking down the hallway and is trying to goof around with Jerry in

06:47.040 --> 06:52.800
accounting and goes, hey, Jerry, go fuck a dog, then that is insufficient.

06:52.800 --> 06:56.720
Okay, so let me draw a line in the middle of those two.

06:56.720 --> 07:00.480
What if it's like, you know, the 12 o'clock lunch hour, everybody's eating, he microwaves

07:00.480 --> 07:02.800
his thing, and he's like, oh, these leftovers taste like shit.

07:03.680 --> 07:04.160
Right?

07:04.160 --> 07:05.600
Hey, Jerry, go fuck a dog.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.280
Go fuck a dog, Jerry.

07:09.280 --> 07:09.920
Come on, man.

07:11.120 --> 07:13.760
You really fucked the dog already, buddy.

07:13.760 --> 07:15.680
Jerry, you're two months late with this report.

07:15.680 --> 07:16.400
Really fuck the dog.

07:16.400 --> 07:18.160
Are we gonna fuck this dog or what, Jerry?

07:18.160 --> 07:23.600
Like, if you're like, hey, Jerry, stop being such a dick, if you're just clowning around,

07:23.600 --> 07:24.880
that's like, that's okay.

07:24.880 --> 07:29.040
But if you're like, hey, Jerry, I'd like to squeeze your dick after a nice dinner and

07:29.040 --> 07:31.440
some cocktails, then that's something that's gonna be out of line.

07:31.440 --> 07:33.120
Maybe we can get a dog in the mix, too.

07:34.240 --> 07:34.800
Just saying.

07:35.440 --> 07:36.240
Ah, Jerry.

07:36.960 --> 07:38.320
All right, see you at the retreat.

07:41.520 --> 07:45.440
I mean, it's weird now that I have a kid.

07:45.440 --> 07:50.400
It's been, like, stopping cursing has been sort of like how I imagine a lot of people

07:51.840 --> 07:52.960
stop smoking.

07:52.960 --> 07:59.040
They keep moving back the drop dead red line, at which point there can be no more.

07:59.040 --> 08:05.680
I mean, I am at a point right now where I'm still swearing, but I know that the, you know,

08:05.680 --> 08:08.160
she's too little to know what I'm doing, so that's fine.

08:08.720 --> 08:12.160
But I don't know that I'm gonna be able to make the transition to not.

08:13.040 --> 08:15.120
I think I'm just gonna have to work really hard to see the difference.

08:15.120 --> 08:17.120
You gotta phase words out, right?

08:17.120 --> 08:18.240
Yeah, exactly.

08:18.240 --> 08:19.600
Justin, real talk.

08:20.240 --> 08:21.840
Look at that sweet baby's face.

08:21.840 --> 08:25.440
At what point are you going to allow her to use curse words in your home?

08:26.080 --> 08:27.040
Oh, she can do that.

08:27.040 --> 08:32.480
I am completely 100% morally unfazed by cursing.

08:32.480 --> 08:33.120
She can curse on me.

08:33.120 --> 08:37.360
You say that now, but you get that child in a preschool or school environment.

08:37.360 --> 08:39.200
See, now this is what you're talking about, Griffin.

08:40.240 --> 08:42.000
I don't care if she curses at home.

08:42.000 --> 08:45.600
I do care if she curses at work when she goes to work.

08:46.160 --> 08:46.720
I need her.

08:46.720 --> 08:48.240
Hey, Jerry, go fuck a dog.

08:49.280 --> 08:50.960
You old dog fucker, you, Jerry.

08:50.960 --> 08:54.480
I can't have her making me look like a bad parent in front of the other moms and dads.

08:57.360 --> 08:58.720
To answer the question, I-

08:59.760 --> 09:02.240
That's what we've been doing for five minutes now.

09:02.240 --> 09:04.080
But I want to say to say something.

09:04.080 --> 09:04.320
Okay.

09:05.040 --> 09:08.960
But I know that I in real life wouldn't.

09:08.960 --> 09:10.640
Mm-mm.

09:10.640 --> 09:13.760
Like I'd feel that need, it would be a little grating.

09:13.760 --> 09:17.360
But I also feel like maybe it's the kind of thing that over time, give it a couple months

09:17.360 --> 09:20.160
and that just because it just fades into the background.

09:20.160 --> 09:23.360
This is another weird quirk of the old office.

09:23.360 --> 09:25.760
Unless you work at like a hospital or something.

09:26.480 --> 09:28.160
Well, then the problem is going to take care of itself.

09:29.200 --> 09:30.400
Go fuck a dog.

09:30.400 --> 09:30.880
I am-

09:30.880 --> 09:32.000
Is that a prescription?

09:32.720 --> 09:33.040
Yes.

09:34.880 --> 09:36.720
What if you were to start off-

09:36.720 --> 09:40.800
Okay, what if you eased into it with like jokes?

09:40.800 --> 09:41.680
Like you start-

09:41.680 --> 09:44.320
Like this is a pretty classic McElroy technique.

09:45.440 --> 09:48.320
You're seriously concerned about it, but you'll joke about it.

09:48.320 --> 09:49.520
Kidding on the square.

09:49.520 --> 09:50.480
Are you talking about-

09:50.480 --> 09:53.520
You know, we didn't invent passive aggressive behavior.

09:54.160 --> 09:57.520
No, we didn't invent passive aggressive joking though.

09:57.520 --> 10:01.120
I think passive aggressive, like it's not passive aggressive.

10:01.120 --> 10:01.760
It's passive.

10:01.760 --> 10:03.600
It's like comical aggressive.

10:03.600 --> 10:07.360
Like you're easing it, like listen to you Mr. Sailor

10:07.360 --> 10:08.640
with that salty tongue.

10:08.640 --> 10:10.480
You start there and then you say that every time

10:10.480 --> 10:12.320
and eventually you're going to get in his head.

10:12.320 --> 10:13.440
Like, are you serious?

10:13.440 --> 10:14.960
Are you being serious with these right now?

10:14.960 --> 10:16.560
And then it's like, well, do you care?

10:16.560 --> 10:19.200
Are you opening the door to the serious conversation?

10:19.200 --> 10:20.400
That I've joked my way into?

10:20.400 --> 10:22.000
Let me throw out another manipulation.

10:22.720 --> 10:25.120
You do passive aggressive roundabout complaints

10:25.120 --> 10:26.320
when you guys are out for drinks like,

10:26.320 --> 10:28.560
man, have you noticed how much people curse around the office?

10:29.600 --> 10:31.360
Yeah, don't make it about him.

10:31.360 --> 10:34.560
You just say like in general, people use a lot of foul language there.

10:34.560 --> 10:35.760
It's kind of upsetting, right?

10:35.760 --> 10:38.320
In a workplace, I just don't think that's appropriate.

10:38.320 --> 10:41.440
Yeah, convince him to make a new rule about cursing.

10:41.440 --> 10:44.960
Or you get him to institute an actual swear jar.

10:44.960 --> 10:47.440
His idea, you didn't have to do shit.

10:48.400 --> 10:50.480
And let's go down another strata

10:50.480 --> 10:53.920
in the passive aggressive dungeon that we're burying ourselves in.

10:53.920 --> 10:56.320
Just write down on a piece of paper,

10:56.320 --> 10:58.880
boy, people at this office sure do swear a lot.

10:58.880 --> 11:00.480
And then you put that in an envelope

11:00.480 --> 11:01.760
and you bury it in the yard.

11:04.800 --> 11:06.720
I think that's more passive than aggressive.

11:07.520 --> 11:09.280
I think that that's just passive.

11:09.280 --> 11:13.040
Sure, but if anyone finds that, oh boy, critical hit.

11:13.040 --> 11:15.040
Well, that's why you can't bury it in your own yard.

11:15.040 --> 11:15.840
No, no, no, no, no.

11:15.840 --> 11:16.800
You bury it in the office yard.

11:16.800 --> 11:17.600
Do you guys want to Yahoo?

11:18.240 --> 11:19.040
Please.

11:19.040 --> 11:22.640
This Yahoo was sent in by Charles Greenman, or perhaps Greenman.

11:23.760 --> 11:24.640
Nah, Greenman.

11:24.640 --> 11:25.200
Thanks, Charles.

11:25.200 --> 11:27.920
It's by Yahoo Answers user Jocelyn, who asks,

11:27.920 --> 11:30.800
can I quicken the braces process?

11:32.800 --> 11:35.680
I heard somebody tell me that her daughter had braces,

11:35.680 --> 11:38.320
but she did the extreme tightening method.

11:38.320 --> 11:39.920
I've never heard of that before,

11:39.920 --> 11:43.280
but is it possible to get your braces extremely tightens

11:43.280 --> 11:45.040
so that you can quicken the process?

11:46.560 --> 11:47.840
Well, let me start off by saying,

11:47.840 --> 11:52.320
I love when the name of any process

11:52.320 --> 11:55.920
tells you everything you need to know about the process.

11:55.920 --> 12:00.640
What do you think is involved in the extreme tightening process?

12:00.640 --> 12:01.600
That's pretty clear.

12:01.600 --> 12:03.920
I know that bringing up this question was kind of a risk

12:03.920 --> 12:08.160
because it's sort of a sticking point between the three of us.

12:08.720 --> 12:09.520
Why is that?

12:09.520 --> 12:11.520
Oh, because our smiles are perfect?

12:11.520 --> 12:13.760
Well, no, your immeasurable jealousy

12:13.760 --> 12:16.800
that I got corrective teeth framing.

12:17.680 --> 12:22.640
Griffin, you went with the normal average kind of wuss tightening system.

12:22.640 --> 12:25.680
It felt like it was a little bit of a stretch.

12:25.680 --> 12:29.360
It felt pretty motherfucking extreme to me.

12:29.360 --> 12:33.360
The scale of one to 10, in which one is like butterfly kisses

12:33.920 --> 12:39.200
and 10 is like getting stabbed in the eyeballs with a blunt hot knife.

12:40.400 --> 12:44.960
Using the doctor face scale of pain,

12:45.520 --> 12:49.280
I was full blown Dawson's Creek season two finale.

12:49.920 --> 12:50.160
Gotcha.

12:50.160 --> 12:55.760
I was like that.

12:55.760 --> 12:58.160
You were Frankenstein's monster in pain.

12:58.160 --> 13:01.280
I was Intervention Dad Psycho Cry.

13:03.600 --> 13:05.920
It was very, very bad.

13:05.920 --> 13:11.600
But I mean, like, can we Emerald Kick this up a notch though?

13:12.720 --> 13:14.640
It took me two years to get through braces.

13:14.640 --> 13:21.200
And I guess if they had just like fucking tore the lever off,

13:21.200 --> 13:21.840
you know what I mean?

13:22.960 --> 13:25.200
Then they could have really juiced that process up

13:25.200 --> 13:26.240
and gotten it done in, I don't know, three months.

13:26.240 --> 13:29.200
I feel like the orthodontist would always have to lead off with,

13:29.200 --> 13:33.920
there's like a 90% chance this just like powders your jaw.

13:33.920 --> 13:34.240
Yeah.

13:34.240 --> 13:37.120
But there's a 10% chance you're done in a week.

13:37.120 --> 13:39.520
I want my teeth to move so fast I can hear them,

13:39.520 --> 13:42.960
is what I hear the sound that they make when they move through my head.

13:42.960 --> 13:45.520
And it's screaming.

13:45.520 --> 13:46.640
That's the worry, right?

13:46.640 --> 13:50.320
That you'll do the tightening so well that you'll take them off

13:50.320 --> 13:56.320
and the momentum will still be pulling them together.

13:56.320 --> 13:58.960
All of a sudden you wake up, you got one giant fat tooth.

13:58.960 --> 14:01.360
Or they line up front to back.

14:03.840 --> 14:07.600
You just have two straight vertical rows of teeth.

14:07.600 --> 14:09.200
What do you want for dinner tonight, Justin?

14:09.200 --> 14:10.080
Well, corn.

14:10.080 --> 14:10.880
Corn only, I guess.

14:10.880 --> 14:13.040
Only corn, only corn ever.

14:16.000 --> 14:20.080
I don't know why our parents got like less tolerant of imperfection

14:20.080 --> 14:25.200
because I clearly like, I have like a full like Michael Strahan gap.

14:26.960 --> 14:28.640
Well, Letterman was real popular.

14:28.640 --> 14:29.840
There were no concessions made to correct that.

14:29.840 --> 14:32.720
I think that they could see you in like a late night comedy.

14:33.760 --> 14:34.960
I think that was their hope.

14:34.960 --> 14:38.320
I've got like a bit of an underbite and I think they're just like,

14:38.320 --> 14:40.560
well, that's the least weird thing about his face.

14:40.560 --> 14:41.440
So we're cool.

14:42.080 --> 14:42.400
We're good.

14:42.400 --> 14:42.880
Is that it?

14:42.880 --> 14:44.400
They knew I was going to be overweight.

14:46.400 --> 14:48.080
Let's get our priorities in order.

14:49.120 --> 14:53.520
But do you take your medicine super fast and have it hurt?

14:53.520 --> 14:56.640
Or do you make it more tolerable and stretch it?

14:56.640 --> 14:58.720
Because you guys don't understand.

14:58.720 --> 15:03.600
For two years, I was an unfuckable claptrap.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.120
How old were you?

15:07.120 --> 15:07.360
Yeah.

15:08.560 --> 15:09.040
Well, okay.

15:09.040 --> 15:10.160
For more reasons than one.

15:10.160 --> 15:11.200
But that was it.

15:11.200 --> 15:12.640
It was a major contributor.

15:13.360 --> 15:18.160
If you were to take a survey, if we were to do a family feud style survey of the women.

15:18.800 --> 15:20.400
Why aren't you fucking Griffin?

15:20.400 --> 15:26.640
Come back middle school because his braces survey says being 55 braces.

15:26.640 --> 15:27.600
But here's the question.

15:27.600 --> 15:30.080
The question is, what's the trade off?

15:30.080 --> 15:34.960
Is it like, it's going to hurt 50% more and you get them off one week sooner?

15:34.960 --> 15:39.040
Or is it like, it's going to hurt 20% more and you only have to wear them for six months?

15:39.040 --> 15:41.200
I'm saying we can- There's a certain balance.

15:41.200 --> 15:45.840
There's no limit to how fucking crazy you can get with the jacking.

15:46.800 --> 15:47.360
Just jacking.

15:47.360 --> 15:48.640
Limitless tightening.

15:48.640 --> 15:52.480
You just put a chain around it and a stick and you just have someone stand in front of you

15:52.480 --> 15:53.920
and twist that chain.

15:53.920 --> 15:55.680
That's basically what braces are, Travis.

15:55.680 --> 15:56.480
Ow.

15:56.480 --> 15:56.720
Yeah.

15:57.920 --> 15:59.360
Count your blessings, brother.

15:59.360 --> 16:03.520
I just recently decided to head back to school in the hopes of improving my job outlook.

16:03.520 --> 16:06.880
A problem that most students have had to deal with has come back to haunt me.

16:06.880 --> 16:11.120
There's a student in the class who insists on making comments constantly.

16:11.120 --> 16:14.160
He has some experience with the coursework, probably from related classes,

16:14.160 --> 16:18.160
and constantly makes comments to show how much he knows and get ahead of the professor.

16:18.160 --> 16:23.200
Most people probably just deal with this and I had in almost every class I've taken,

16:24.160 --> 16:28.720
but I really hate this guy and all guys or gals like him.

16:29.360 --> 16:33.840
How do I get him to shut the fuck up so I could just enjoy my class?

16:33.840 --> 16:36.720
That's for most annoyed in the Mountain West.

16:36.720 --> 16:38.800
It sounds to me like you got a minkus on your hands.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.200
A real minkus.

16:41.200 --> 16:42.640
A real grade A minkus.

16:44.560 --> 16:46.720
Have we talked about dealing with a minkus before?

16:47.440 --> 16:47.840
No.

16:47.840 --> 16:51.920
We've talked about minkus a lot, but not how to deal with a minkus.

16:51.920 --> 16:55.040
Not preventative minkus measures.

16:55.040 --> 16:56.720
How to attract and catch a minkus.

16:57.920 --> 17:00.240
Proper minkus care and raising.

17:00.240 --> 17:03.520
How to raise one from egg to hatchling.

17:03.520 --> 17:05.840
About his second level and third level evolution.

17:05.840 --> 17:10.800
Guys, my minkus has been in heat lately and there is like nothing I can do.

17:10.800 --> 17:12.720
It's just like fucking humping the window.

17:13.520 --> 17:16.800
You get that minkus, wait till he gets on a good tear, okay?

17:17.440 --> 17:23.760
Wait till he's like really, you know, all right, here are some things to know about details.

17:23.760 --> 17:25.200
You wait till he's like really going.

17:25.200 --> 17:27.280
Then what you do is you take the meaty part of your hand,

17:27.280 --> 17:29.040
you're gonna put it on the side of your mouth just like this.

17:29.600 --> 17:32.320
And then you're gonna press the palm in front of your mouth and then you're gonna blow.

17:32.320 --> 17:38.880
If that, that would be probably the best thing that has ever happened in this class.

17:38.880 --> 17:44.000
The teacher's gonna be like A+, and he's gonna give you a sticker or something.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.160
That minkus is gonna get the picture.

17:47.200 --> 17:53.200
Um, I mean that you gotta, you, collusion with the teacher is necessary for this situation.

17:53.200 --> 17:55.520
If you're gonna put this fucking minkus in his place,

17:56.320 --> 17:58.800
then you're gonna need to talk to the teacher and get the teacher to

17:58.800 --> 18:05.040
to ask minkus something that he could not possibly know about.

18:05.040 --> 18:06.320
Like a logical fallacy?

18:07.200 --> 18:09.200
I'm not saying, no, I'm not, no.

18:09.200 --> 18:13.040
I'm not saying like ask him if God could make a rock so big that he couldn't move it.

18:13.600 --> 18:14.800
Cause maybe he's a robot.

18:14.800 --> 18:16.800
More important, I think he's just a nerd.

18:16.800 --> 18:17.760
But no, you know what?

18:17.760 --> 18:19.360
I'm turning the corner on this whole question.

18:19.360 --> 18:19.920
So what?

18:20.960 --> 18:21.440
So what?

18:21.440 --> 18:25.520
Maybe that's what this person needs to, to excel educationally.

18:25.520 --> 18:29.120
I'm gonna, I'm gonna counterpoint because when I went back to school

18:29.120 --> 18:31.840
and took some psychology classes in one of my classes,

18:31.840 --> 18:34.400
there was just, it was the abnormal psychology.

18:34.400 --> 18:38.480
So every time we talked about any kind of different condition or disease,

18:39.520 --> 18:41.280
there was someone in the class and it varied.

18:41.280 --> 18:42.320
It was always different.

18:42.320 --> 18:46.240
Who felt the need to throw out some kind of germane or non-germane fact.

18:46.240 --> 18:50.080
Like my aunt had postpartum depression.

18:50.080 --> 18:53.280
Germane Dupree, Germane Dupree had postpartum depression.

18:53.280 --> 18:56.480
They did and like we were all adults, we were all 18 or older.

18:56.480 --> 19:00.960
And it was the most frustrating thing because if you're there to learn,

19:00.960 --> 19:03.920
if you're going back to school to better yourself,

19:03.920 --> 19:06.960
and this is not like I'm an 18 year old who's in school

19:06.960 --> 19:08.320
because I feel like I have to,

19:08.320 --> 19:12.800
but rather a 25 year old who now appreciated how important school is.

19:12.800 --> 19:17.040
It's so frustrating when suddenly you want to learn

19:17.040 --> 19:19.760
and everyone in class is stopping you from doing it.

19:19.760 --> 19:22.640
It's like, I'm actually paying to be here and I care about this.

19:22.640 --> 19:27.520
And you guys want to talk about how this relates to you specifically.

19:27.520 --> 19:28.960
And that's like the worst.

19:30.960 --> 19:32.480
Alternative method.

19:32.480 --> 19:36.000
If you just wait until like season four, he'll just disappear.

19:36.000 --> 19:36.960
That is correct.

19:36.960 --> 19:38.400
But you'll also lose Mr. Turner.

19:38.400 --> 19:39.920
You'll lose Mr. Turner and that's rough

19:39.920 --> 19:42.320
because I think he brought a certain something to the show.

19:42.320 --> 19:44.000
I mean, your class, your life.

19:44.560 --> 19:45.840
He was a sensitive bad boy.

19:47.680 --> 19:50.480
He was, he rode a motorcycle and he took care of Sean Hunter.

19:50.480 --> 19:51.600
How about a Yahoo?

19:51.600 --> 19:52.160
Anything.

19:52.160 --> 19:54.720
This is Yahoo sent by John Severs or Severs.

19:55.440 --> 19:57.520
Is a Johnson too much to ask for?

19:58.320 --> 19:59.360
For one of these last names.

20:00.080 --> 20:00.880
A Thompson.

20:01.440 --> 20:02.320
Thank you, John.

20:02.320 --> 20:03.200
Severs, Severs.

20:03.200 --> 20:04.560
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

20:05.120 --> 20:05.920
Meow.

20:05.920 --> 20:06.240
Meow.

20:07.200 --> 20:08.560
Fucking shit.

20:08.560 --> 20:08.960
Meow.

20:08.960 --> 20:10.800
It's Tia.

20:13.200 --> 20:15.920
Who asks, good answer to the question.

20:15.920 --> 20:17.920
Why do you want to work for Chipotle?

20:19.040 --> 20:20.640
I am beyond stuck.

20:20.640 --> 20:22.640
I have been searching for a job for a year now

20:22.640 --> 20:24.720
and I really want to stand out to Chipotle.

20:24.720 --> 20:26.480
What would be a good answer to this question?

20:27.200 --> 20:28.560
Okay, you're gonna ask me the question.

20:29.280 --> 20:31.520
Why do you want to work for Chipotle?

20:31.520 --> 20:33.120
So I can afford to buy weed.

20:33.120 --> 20:37.280
Yeah, I mean, and also have a pretty good place

20:37.920 --> 20:40.560
to know people who will sell me weed probably.

20:40.560 --> 20:41.760
I don't want to throw stones.

20:41.760 --> 20:45.040
And then I've got stuff to eat when I'm doing weed

20:45.040 --> 20:46.800
because Chipotle's okay.

20:46.800 --> 20:48.800
Arguably the best stuff to eat.

20:48.800 --> 20:49.360
God, I could.

20:49.360 --> 20:52.000
I could crush some Chipotle right now.

20:52.800 --> 20:53.600
What time is it there?

20:54.880 --> 20:55.520
Chipotle time.

20:55.520 --> 20:58.480
No, what time is it actually on the Gregorian clock?

21:00.000 --> 21:01.680
It's 10, 24 a.m.

21:02.240 --> 21:03.920
But Jocelyn's been up for eight hours.

21:03.920 --> 21:05.680
So he's at dinner time.

21:06.320 --> 21:11.600
He's like, these prescriptive definitions of what time means.

21:11.600 --> 21:14.160
They don't mean anything to me or my baby,

21:14.160 --> 21:15.520
but specifically my baby.

21:15.520 --> 21:19.520
Or I can eat, it's the one good thing about being a dad

21:19.520 --> 21:21.840
is that I can eat Chipotle whenever I want.

21:21.840 --> 21:25.120
That's the one good thing about being a dad.

21:25.120 --> 21:27.440
Chipotle around the clock.

21:30.560 --> 21:32.080
What is a good answer to the question,

21:32.080 --> 21:33.360
why do you want to work for Chipotle?

21:33.360 --> 21:35.840
I mean, that's, I feel like we can extend this to-

21:35.840 --> 21:37.600
All the clothes I own smell too good.

21:38.960 --> 21:40.400
We can extend this to anything, right?

21:40.400 --> 21:43.680
Because I remember doing a job interview

21:43.680 --> 21:46.240
at the country's best yogurt.

21:46.240 --> 21:47.200
And they were asking me like,

21:47.200 --> 21:49.440
what is it about the country's best yogurt brand

21:49.440 --> 21:52.320
that really attracted you to try and fill this position?

21:53.360 --> 21:57.520
And I was like, guys, you really want to answer to that?

21:57.520 --> 21:58.480
Oh boy, I love it.

21:58.480 --> 22:00.400
Because it's only a block and a half away.

22:00.400 --> 22:02.640
It's super close to my house and like,

22:02.640 --> 22:03.840
fuck ice cream, right?

22:03.840 --> 22:04.640
Too hard for me.

22:09.120 --> 22:11.040
I just love the smell of rotten milk.

22:11.040 --> 22:14.400
I had to deal with that when I interviewed at Jimmy John's.

22:14.400 --> 22:17.680
It was a very like, what's your passion?

22:17.680 --> 22:19.840
Why are you so serious about sandwiches?

22:19.840 --> 22:20.400
What does it mean?

22:20.400 --> 22:21.920
What does Jimmy John's mean to you?

22:21.920 --> 22:23.360
I had to do three interviews

22:23.360 --> 22:25.600
and take a test on the goddamn sandwiches.

22:25.600 --> 22:28.240
What can you tell me about the sandwich test?

22:28.240 --> 22:29.200
How fucking hard can it-

22:29.200 --> 22:31.840
They would give me a blank piece of paper

22:31.840 --> 22:33.600
and without looking, I had to write down

22:33.600 --> 22:36.480
the name of each sandwich, what came on each sandwich,

22:36.480 --> 22:38.640
what came on the skinny versions of the sandwich

22:38.640 --> 22:40.960
and what came on like the Big Buford sandwich.

22:40.960 --> 22:43.280
Or whatever their like huge sandwich is.

22:43.840 --> 22:47.120
Travis, how much of this knowledge

22:47.120 --> 22:48.880
would you say you still retain?

22:48.880 --> 22:51.040
I would say, Justin, that about 10 minutes

22:51.040 --> 22:53.440
after I filled out the paper, I forgot all of it.

22:53.440 --> 22:53.920
Yeah.

22:53.920 --> 22:54.400
Okay.

22:54.400 --> 22:58.400
I never made a single sandwich in my two months at Jimmy John's.

22:58.400 --> 22:59.840
Well, okay, Mr. Big Shot.

22:59.840 --> 23:01.120
Let's see if that's true.

23:04.400 --> 23:08.400
Justin, you are so good at gamifying this podcast.

23:08.400 --> 23:10.960
I'm gonna name some Jimmy John's sandwiches.

23:10.960 --> 23:12.960
Travis, you are gonna tell me,

23:12.960 --> 23:15.200
not joking now, I don't want any fucking jokes.

23:15.200 --> 23:16.480
I will try to be serious.

23:16.480 --> 23:18.480
I want you to tell me what comes on them.

23:18.480 --> 23:19.520
Are you ready?

23:19.520 --> 23:19.760
Yes.

23:20.320 --> 23:20.640
Okay.

23:22.240 --> 23:23.200
Turkey Tom.

23:23.200 --> 23:24.480
I know that that was a turkey.

23:25.680 --> 23:26.160
Okay, good.

23:26.160 --> 23:28.320
And I think there's like tomatoes and lettuce.

23:28.320 --> 23:29.200
Mayonnaise?

23:29.200 --> 23:30.160
That's all I got.

23:30.160 --> 23:32.000
That's exactly what's on the Turkey Tom, Travis.

23:32.000 --> 23:32.560
Travis, see?

23:32.560 --> 23:33.680
There's nothing else fucking-

23:33.680 --> 23:35.520
I'm sorry, there's no cheese?

23:35.520 --> 23:38.320
No, cheese is like fucking two and a half dollars extra,

23:38.320 --> 23:39.920
if you want any cheese on a sandwich.

23:39.920 --> 23:41.360
That's the Turkey Tom, Travis.

23:41.360 --> 23:42.880
It's time to get a little more challenging.

23:42.880 --> 23:43.520
Okay.

23:43.520 --> 23:44.960
Why don't you tell me what's on the Vito?

23:46.080 --> 23:48.080
I know that the Vito has,

23:49.120 --> 23:53.360
I want to say capicola, provolone, Italian dressing.

23:53.360 --> 23:54.640
That's all I can remember.

23:54.640 --> 23:55.200
I think-

23:55.200 --> 23:56.160
That's pretty good.

23:56.880 --> 23:58.640
It's got lettuce on it, doesn't it?

23:58.640 --> 24:04.240
Salami, provolone, capicola, onion, lettuce, tomato, and Italian vinaigrette.

24:04.240 --> 24:07.200
You left a lot of stuff off that James Johnson sandwich.

24:07.200 --> 24:09.920
If you delivered that to my door, Travis,

24:09.920 --> 24:12.400
I would tell you, shove this up your ass.

24:12.400 --> 24:12.960
Go fuck a dog.

24:12.960 --> 24:16.560
That was my primary job at the Jimmy John's, the delivery driver.

24:16.560 --> 24:21.040
And the people you deliver Jimmy John's to on a Wednesday afternoon

24:21.040 --> 24:22.800
are some of the best people.

24:23.360 --> 24:25.520
Yeah, it's real salt of the earth, real America.

24:25.520 --> 24:26.400
Real top notch.

24:27.280 --> 24:29.200
Travis, this bit's pretty funny,

24:29.200 --> 24:31.440
so I want to keep it going with one last question.

24:31.440 --> 24:31.940
Okay.

24:32.480 --> 24:34.000
The JJ Gargantuan.

24:34.000 --> 24:34.240
Oh, fuck.

24:34.240 --> 24:38.000
That's everything in the store, plus a cookie and maybe a lemonade.

24:38.000 --> 24:39.120
You put a cookie on it?

24:39.120 --> 24:40.640
And then you dunk it in a lemonade,

24:40.640 --> 24:43.280
and then you deliver it to them in the lemonade cup.

24:43.280 --> 24:44.720
And you just kind of throw it at them,

24:44.720 --> 24:46.560
and they catch as much as they can in their mouth.

24:46.560 --> 24:50.240
Drink this detritus slurry, you fuck up.

24:50.240 --> 24:51.760
Enjoy, you filthy animal.

24:53.200 --> 24:55.200
And then you thank them for coming to Jimmy Johnson

24:55.200 --> 24:56.400
and give them some free spells.

24:56.400 --> 25:00.480
I'm more curious to hear what you said to convince them

25:00.480 --> 25:04.080
that you fostered a true and intimate love

25:04.080 --> 25:08.400
of the James Johnson brand that made him give you employ.

25:08.400 --> 25:10.800
I cannot remember, but what I can tell you

25:10.800 --> 25:13.840
is after two months, never making a single sandwich,

25:13.840 --> 25:15.600
because every time it came time to make a sandwich,

25:15.600 --> 25:19.440
they'd say like, maybe the Huntsman or whatever it's called.

25:19.440 --> 25:20.560
And I would go to make it and say,

25:20.560 --> 25:21.520
I don't know how to make this.

25:21.520 --> 25:22.880
And they'd be like, just get on register.

25:22.880 --> 25:23.520
We'll teach you later.

25:23.520 --> 25:24.240
And they never did.

25:24.240 --> 25:28.160
After two months, the day before I was going to quit,

25:28.160 --> 25:31.280
they offered me an assistant manager position.

25:35.280 --> 25:40.240
How long would you have to keep up this fucking ruse

25:40.240 --> 25:42.240
that like, you would at some point

25:42.240 --> 25:44.240
have to train people how to make sandwiches?

25:45.680 --> 25:46.240
Oh, that's good.

25:46.240 --> 25:47.600
Where's the peanut butter, Steve?

25:48.160 --> 25:49.600
We don't do peanut butter sandwiches?

25:49.600 --> 25:52.080
Just layer it on, just give it a good slather.

25:52.080 --> 25:53.840
I don't know, cucumbers?

25:53.840 --> 25:56.160
Fuck, fuck it.

25:56.160 --> 25:58.400
No, I mean, that's why they wanted to elevate you, Travis,

25:58.400 --> 26:00.080
is because they realized that you weren't,

26:00.080 --> 26:02.960
you were meant for something more than the grunt work.

26:02.960 --> 26:03.360
Yeah.

26:03.360 --> 26:03.840
Look at him.

26:03.840 --> 26:04.720
He's a guy.

26:04.720 --> 26:05.600
He's an officer.

26:05.600 --> 26:06.960
He's no enlisted man.

26:06.960 --> 26:08.720
Make that sandwich.

26:09.280 --> 26:10.960
Are you fucking kidding me?

26:10.960 --> 26:12.480
I should be running this place.

26:12.480 --> 26:12.800
I'm not.

26:12.800 --> 26:14.560
I'm wearing the vest now.

26:14.560 --> 26:16.560
It's about the sandwiches he doesn't make.

26:18.880 --> 26:22.320
He knows the forbidden sandwiches, the dark veto.

26:22.320 --> 26:24.000
I will say this, they were very impressed

26:24.000 --> 26:26.160
that when I was doing the register,

26:26.160 --> 26:28.000
I could do math in my head.

26:28.000 --> 26:28.400
Yeah.

26:28.400 --> 26:31.520
That was very impressive to everyone I worked with,

26:31.520 --> 26:33.760
that I could tell someone how much change they got

26:33.760 --> 26:34.960
without looking at the screen.

26:34.960 --> 26:38.960
It's because you had so much unoccupied RAM up there

26:38.960 --> 26:42.880
from not memorizing how to do anything else for the job.

26:42.880 --> 26:43.520
That is correct.

26:44.160 --> 26:46.480
I also didn't know where anything else was in the city.

26:46.480 --> 26:48.400
So when I tried to, because it was in Norman,

26:48.400 --> 26:50.320
so when I tried to deliver sandwiches,

26:50.320 --> 26:54.080
it would usually take me 20 minutes longer than anyone else.

26:54.080 --> 26:58.080
He's just not fit for that base level stuff.

26:58.080 --> 26:59.760
We have to raise him up.

26:59.760 --> 27:02.240
It is very much like when you see in movies and TV shows

27:02.240 --> 27:04.160
those kids where it's like, well,

27:04.160 --> 27:06.400
maybe he's underperforming because he's not

27:06.400 --> 27:07.600
challenged enough.

27:07.600 --> 27:10.640
He's been managing this store for two months now,

27:10.640 --> 27:12.480
and he's done a fucking terrible job.

27:12.480 --> 27:15.280
We got to keep bumping him up the ladder

27:15.280 --> 27:16.800
until we find something that energizes him.

27:16.800 --> 27:19.440
They offered me the role of Jimmy John, and I turned it down.

27:19.440 --> 27:20.560
You're the new Jimmy John.

27:21.120 --> 27:23.920
You are doing terrible at that, Mr. President.

27:24.880 --> 27:26.080
Have you guys seen The Giver?

27:26.640 --> 27:27.440
It's kind of like that.

27:27.440 --> 27:29.280
That's how one becomes Jimmy John.

27:29.280 --> 27:31.520
He has to pass off all of his free smells to you.

27:32.880 --> 27:33.440
Let's get the money.

27:44.160 --> 27:46.240
I'm tired of my shitty underwear.

27:47.280 --> 27:48.080
You need to wash it.

27:48.080 --> 27:49.920
You shouldn't be wearing those.

27:51.280 --> 27:51.920
Crappy.

27:51.920 --> 27:52.080
No.

27:53.200 --> 27:53.920
Poopy diapers.

27:54.720 --> 27:55.600
Shit filled.

27:56.960 --> 27:58.480
I think that one of the transitions

27:59.040 --> 28:02.400
from childhood to adulthood is when you buy yourself

28:03.520 --> 28:05.280
some really good underpants.

28:05.840 --> 28:07.280
There's something about like, you know,

28:07.280 --> 28:09.280
everybody's got their favorite pairs of underpants,

28:09.280 --> 28:11.200
and then they've got their off-court buddies.

28:12.400 --> 28:17.680
It is a defining moment when the number one factor

28:17.680 --> 28:19.600
for which underwear you're going to buy

28:19.600 --> 28:20.880
is how many come in the pack.

28:22.880 --> 28:24.400
And if you're ready to move on up,

28:25.120 --> 28:27.840
we would like to suggest MeUndies.

28:28.640 --> 28:29.760
We've talked about glasses.

28:29.760 --> 28:31.040
We've talked about razors.

28:31.040 --> 28:33.040
You can buy Justin McElroy's underwear.

28:34.640 --> 28:37.040
Lightly, lightly used.

28:37.040 --> 28:38.000
And signed.

28:38.000 --> 28:38.640
Thoroughly cleansed.

28:38.640 --> 28:39.920
Dustin Gaffard's.

28:39.920 --> 28:40.640
Oh, Jesus.

28:41.840 --> 28:42.320
MeUndies.

28:42.320 --> 28:43.360
Yeah, they're all new.

28:43.360 --> 28:48.080
MeUndies guarantees the underwear not pre-worn.

28:48.080 --> 28:49.280
They're going to be the most comfortable underwear

28:49.280 --> 28:50.240
you've ever tried on.

28:50.240 --> 28:52.640
That's what we are told.

28:52.640 --> 28:54.240
And they fit.

28:54.240 --> 28:55.120
They don't ride up.

28:55.760 --> 28:57.040
And they pull, listen to this.

28:57.760 --> 29:00.320
They pull moisture away from your skin

29:00.320 --> 29:02.800
and keep you cool all day long.

29:02.800 --> 29:05.280
Now don't get scared,

29:05.280 --> 29:07.040
because it's not going to pull all the moisture

29:07.600 --> 29:09.440
out of your penis or vagina like the mummy.

29:09.440 --> 29:10.640
It's not going to be dusty.

29:10.640 --> 29:13.840
Like that scene in the movie The Mummy.

29:13.840 --> 29:16.080
When Brendan Fraser pulls all that moisture

29:16.080 --> 29:17.200
away from someone's dick.

29:20.080 --> 29:22.800
Don't be scared of that happening to you in real life.

29:22.800 --> 29:23.840
It's not going to happen.

29:25.680 --> 29:27.920
Dwayne The Rock Johnson is not going to remove

29:27.920 --> 29:29.680
all of your dick water or vagina water.

29:29.680 --> 29:30.480
Here's the awesome thing.

29:30.480 --> 29:32.000
Not only are they comfy,

29:32.000 --> 29:34.160
not only are they going to keep you cool all day long,

29:34.160 --> 29:35.680
but they also look great.

29:35.680 --> 29:36.880
You can go to meundies.com

29:36.880 --> 29:39.040
and check out all the different styles and everything.

29:39.040 --> 29:41.040
And it's really pretty cool.

29:41.040 --> 29:42.640
You know what I like about the styles, Travis?

29:42.640 --> 29:46.400
They have matching styles for ladies and dudes.

29:46.400 --> 29:49.120
So if you and your SO want to get a matching pair,

29:49.760 --> 29:50.880
I don't, that's-

29:50.880 --> 29:55.040
If that's a concern for you, go to town.

29:55.040 --> 29:56.400
I really only have to worry about that

29:56.400 --> 29:58.880
when I like fucking bend over to pick something up

29:58.880 --> 30:00.720
and the top of my stuff pops out.

30:01.360 --> 30:07.360
And dad got me a pair of Xbox boxers for Christmas

30:07.360 --> 30:09.600
when I was like in high school that I still have.

30:10.400 --> 30:12.080
And sometimes I'll wear those

30:12.080 --> 30:13.520
and I'm like, you know, mowing the lawn

30:13.520 --> 30:16.240
and I'm like, I just need something to get juicy,

30:16.240 --> 30:18.400
you know, and I don't want to ruin my good stuff.

30:18.400 --> 30:20.480
And so I'll wear those and I'll forget about it

30:20.480 --> 30:22.880
and someone will come over and I'll bend over

30:22.880 --> 30:26.480
and they'll say, what the fuck are you wearing?

30:26.480 --> 30:27.920
Are those Xboxers?

30:27.920 --> 30:30.640
And I'll say, yes, I'm an Xbox for life.

30:30.640 --> 30:32.640
I love, I hate Crash Bandicoot

30:32.640 --> 30:34.480
and I love Blinks the Time Sweeper.

30:34.480 --> 30:34.960
That's what I tell them.

30:34.960 --> 30:37.520
If you love Blinks the Time Sweeper too, you can go

30:37.520 --> 30:41.200
to meundies.com slash my brother, that's meundies,

30:41.200 --> 30:45.840
M-E-U-N-D-I-E-S.com slash my brother

30:45.840 --> 30:48.640
and you'll get 20% off your first order

30:48.640 --> 30:51.920
and right now you can get free shipping in the US and Canada.

30:51.920 --> 30:52.640
Are you guys ready?

30:52.640 --> 30:53.280
I'm going to blow your mind.

30:53.280 --> 30:54.240
Don't mind if I do.

30:54.240 --> 30:55.120
I'm going to blow your mind

30:55.120 --> 30:57.120
because I'm looking at meundies.com right now.

30:57.840 --> 31:02.000
They offer, okay, so they have like, you know,

31:02.000 --> 31:05.840
a 10 pack of briefs, like a, you know,

31:05.840 --> 31:07.120
three pack of t-shirts.

31:07.680 --> 31:12.400
They offer a 365 pack of underwear.

31:12.400 --> 31:13.440
Holy shit.

31:14.960 --> 31:16.960
That will do me for half a year.

31:18.320 --> 31:19.920
Now it is $4,000.

31:20.640 --> 31:21.680
Is it really?

31:21.680 --> 31:22.960
Yes, but.

31:22.960 --> 31:23.920
But, I mean, that's-

31:23.920 --> 31:27.200
That's, you are good for life.

31:27.200 --> 31:28.880
Well, for a year or half a year.

31:28.880 --> 31:32.080
Well, if you wear a pair of underwear a day

31:32.080 --> 31:34.880
and then throw them away at the end of the day,

31:34.880 --> 31:36.320
then yes, you are good for-

31:36.320 --> 31:37.920
MeUnderwear is the most expensive,

31:37.920 --> 31:39.680
disposable underwear on the market.

31:39.680 --> 31:42.320
Listen, sometimes there's some people

31:43.360 --> 31:44.400
that have to do that.

31:44.400 --> 31:46.160
Can we not fucking judge?

31:47.200 --> 31:49.200
I thought this was a safe fucking space.

31:49.840 --> 31:52.880
Go to meundies.com slash my brother and get 20% off.

31:54.080 --> 31:55.440
Highly recommend.

31:55.440 --> 31:56.480
All right, you're in your underwear.

31:56.480 --> 31:57.200
You're comfortable.

31:57.200 --> 31:59.600
What are you gonna watch?

32:01.520 --> 32:02.160
Time Pass?

32:02.960 --> 32:04.560
No, you're gonna watch Hulu Plus.

32:06.960 --> 32:09.520
I can't believe anybody doesn't know about HuluPlus.com.

32:10.720 --> 32:13.120
It is where you can watch current season episodes

32:13.120 --> 32:14.640
of your favorite shows like Modern Family,

32:14.640 --> 32:16.960
Daily Show with Don Stewart,

32:16.960 --> 32:17.920
and every episode-

32:17.920 --> 32:18.720
Did you say Don?

32:18.720 --> 32:19.520
I'm sorry, with who?

32:20.720 --> 32:21.920
Sorry, with Jon Stewart.

32:21.920 --> 32:22.640
I believe you said Don Stewart.

32:22.640 --> 32:25.280
I'm almost 100% sure you said Don Stewart.

32:25.280 --> 32:27.520
Hi, everybody, I'm Don Stewart,

32:27.520 --> 32:30.640
and welcome to The Daily Show starring me, Don Stewart.

32:31.440 --> 32:32.800
I hope you enjoy it.

32:32.800 --> 32:36.720
We're gonna take a look at all the big news stories from today,

32:36.720 --> 32:38.720
and then we're gonna put a comedy twist on them.

32:38.720 --> 32:40.000
Enjoy, I'm Don Stewart.

32:40.800 --> 32:42.640
Why does Don Stewart sound like Diane Rehm?

32:43.760 --> 32:46.800
You're gonna watch every episode of shows like South Park,

32:46.800 --> 32:48.720
which you're gonna only get on Hulu Plus.

32:48.720 --> 32:49.840
That'd be a good binge.

32:49.840 --> 32:52.000
That binge would go down really smooth,

32:52.000 --> 32:55.280
but you don't just have to watch it on your computer.

32:55.280 --> 32:56.960
It's on smart TVs.

32:56.960 --> 32:57.920
It's on your Roku.

32:57.920 --> 32:58.960
It's on your Apple TV.

32:58.960 --> 33:01.200
It's on your any streaming device.

33:01.200 --> 33:02.000
It's on my what?

33:03.040 --> 33:04.800
It's on your Xbox.

33:04.800 --> 33:05.520
Oh, boy.

33:09.040 --> 33:12.320
I hope those PlayStation jerks never get it.

33:12.320 --> 33:15.760
There are assumptions that you can only get on Hulu.

33:15.760 --> 33:18.000
Like, it's just Hulu stuff.

33:18.000 --> 33:21.040
There's a new season of East Los High,

33:21.040 --> 33:23.600
which was last summer's, and I'm quoting,

33:23.600 --> 33:25.440
summer breakout, Summer Sizzler.

33:26.720 --> 33:29.680
So that's got sex and love and betrayal.

33:29.680 --> 33:31.040
And you like those things.

33:31.040 --> 33:32.000
I love those things.

33:32.000 --> 33:33.920
They got Hot Wives of Orlando,

33:33.920 --> 33:36.400
which is a parody of The Real Housewives.

33:36.400 --> 33:38.960
It's a very funny Casey Wilson, Christian Schaal, and others.

33:39.920 --> 33:43.280
There's also The Awesomes, which is Seth Meyers show.

33:43.840 --> 33:45.360
It's about a group of superheroes.

33:46.560 --> 33:47.360
Oh, and Quick Draw.

33:47.360 --> 33:48.480
And there's one called Quick Draw,

33:48.480 --> 33:51.600
which is an improvised comedy set in the Wild West.

33:52.640 --> 33:53.680
Highly recommended.

33:53.680 --> 33:54.400
Highly recommended.

33:54.400 --> 33:55.760
There's five out of five.

33:55.760 --> 33:58.400
And they still have The Prophet, which is like the best.

33:58.400 --> 34:01.840
And Bob's Burgers, which is like Teresa's favorite thing ever.

34:01.840 --> 34:02.880
It's a pretty good show.

34:02.880 --> 34:04.960
We've watched Bob's Burgers straight through like seven times.

34:04.960 --> 34:08.400
So you can get infinite television programming for $7.99 a month.

34:09.120 --> 34:12.720
But if you go to huluplus.com slash my brother, all one word,

34:12.720 --> 34:17.040
you can get a two week free trial into the Hulu Plus experience.

34:17.040 --> 34:20.640
That's an extra week on top of the standard trial they offer.

34:20.640 --> 34:21.520
And we'll give it to you.

34:21.520 --> 34:22.320
Half a month.

34:22.320 --> 34:22.960
Go to Hulu Plus.

34:22.960 --> 34:23.600
Look at it this way.

34:23.600 --> 34:25.840
You're going to sign up for it.

34:25.840 --> 34:27.040
It is inevitable.

34:27.040 --> 34:30.400
You're going to do it eventually because everyone's doing it

34:30.400 --> 34:32.560
and you don't want to be the last one at the station.

34:32.560 --> 34:35.520
So why not just do it now and get a week free?

34:36.640 --> 34:38.000
And just get it over with.

34:38.000 --> 34:38.800
Just get it over with.

34:38.800 --> 34:39.200
Do it.

34:39.840 --> 34:43.440
I'm sure that's what the nice people at Hulu want to hear us say about their product.

34:43.440 --> 34:44.240
Just get it over.

34:44.240 --> 34:47.440
Just rip that fucking Band-Aid off.

34:47.440 --> 34:48.000
Thank you, Hulu.

34:48.000 --> 34:49.280
Huluplus.com slash my brother.

34:49.280 --> 34:49.680
Try it out.

34:50.240 --> 34:53.600
Got a message for Liz real quick from Aaron who says,

34:53.600 --> 34:56.480
to my beautiful wife on her big 3-0.

34:57.280 --> 35:01.600
Does that mean she's 30 or that she's won three games and lost zero?

35:01.600 --> 35:02.080
That's it.

35:02.720 --> 35:03.360
Happy birthday.

35:03.360 --> 35:04.720
Great fantasy performance.

35:04.720 --> 35:08.800
Happy birthday to my favorite human and the greatest development director

35:08.800 --> 35:12.000
or occupational therapist or small business owner

35:12.000 --> 35:14.240
or whatever new career ideas you've come up with.

35:14.800 --> 35:15.840
Animal trainer?

35:15.840 --> 35:17.680
Anyway, you're the best.

35:17.680 --> 35:18.160
Here's to-

35:18.160 --> 35:23.360
Aaron, can you chill with the passive aggressiveness for like one birthday message, please?

35:23.360 --> 35:28.400
Here's to many more years of having fun and making frighteningly detailed life plans.

35:29.680 --> 35:30.000
Great.

35:31.040 --> 35:33.760
I think this is Aaron's way of saying happy birthday

35:33.760 --> 35:36.000
and also if you could help out with the ring.

35:36.000 --> 35:42.560
And also pick something.

35:42.560 --> 35:43.520
Oh, happy birthday.

35:43.520 --> 35:44.480
Happy birthday, Liz.

35:44.480 --> 35:45.040
You have a great one.

35:45.040 --> 35:46.080
Aaron loves you very much.

35:46.080 --> 35:46.640
You know what?

35:46.640 --> 35:51.760
He didn't ask for this, but I think small business owner sounds just about right for Liz.

35:51.760 --> 35:53.840
You could be a small business owner slash animal trainer.

35:53.840 --> 35:57.360
But not, I'm talking about the building size.

35:58.080 --> 35:58.800
Oh, okay.

35:58.800 --> 36:00.080
I want it to be little.

36:00.880 --> 36:02.800
I mean, too big and you got to pay for like-

36:02.800 --> 36:05.120
This is my food truck where I train animals.

36:05.120 --> 36:05.920
It's little.

36:05.920 --> 36:07.280
It's a little truck too.

36:07.280 --> 36:08.800
The littlest food truck.

36:08.800 --> 36:09.360
Oh my God.

36:09.360 --> 36:11.920
If you could open the littlest food truck, you're going to make bank.

36:11.920 --> 36:14.800
It's just a Ford F-150 with a fucking pop-up tent.

36:16.000 --> 36:18.400
I got a message for Kevin Schmidt from Alex and Sarah.

36:19.200 --> 36:20.880
And this is a really good message.

36:21.920 --> 36:22.960
So get comfortable.

36:23.840 --> 36:24.560
Hey, Schmitty.

36:25.200 --> 36:26.480
Want to play Diablo later?

36:29.440 --> 36:30.320
It's awesome.

36:30.320 --> 36:31.040
It's amazing.

36:32.880 --> 36:34.000
Is it better?

36:34.000 --> 36:38.560
This was another one that said whenever, but there was no specified date.

36:38.560 --> 36:42.080
So they are open to playing Diablo later any day of the week.

36:43.680 --> 36:47.600
I imagine they probably wanted this to go up a little bit closer to when Diablo

36:48.400 --> 36:51.440
launched on consoles last month, but whatever.

36:52.480 --> 36:55.360
He's been asking them about playing for like weeks.

36:55.360 --> 36:55.680
Yeah.

36:55.680 --> 36:56.400
Are you guys sure?

36:56.400 --> 36:57.760
Can we please play?

36:57.760 --> 36:59.200
Not yet, Schmitty.

36:59.200 --> 37:00.160
We'll tell you when you're ready.

37:01.040 --> 37:02.800
We'll tell you when we're ready to play.

37:02.800 --> 37:06.800
I feel like the Jumbotron, which by the way, if you want to get a message on the show,

37:06.800 --> 37:10.880
go to maximumfun.org slash Jumbotron and you can get that set up.

37:10.880 --> 37:15.600
But I feel like people used to treat Jumbotron as a canvas upon which they would paint.

37:15.600 --> 37:24.560
And then some like intrepid individuals have begun using the Jumbotron itself as the medium.

37:24.560 --> 37:25.200
You know what I mean?

37:25.200 --> 37:33.360
Like they are shaping the vehicle known as the Jumbotron into its own form of art.

37:33.920 --> 37:38.240
It's becoming like a social networking platform in and of itself.

37:38.240 --> 37:38.720
Right.

37:38.720 --> 37:40.880
And we get hundreds of dollars from it.

37:41.680 --> 37:42.880
So it benefits everyone.

37:42.880 --> 37:45.040
Keep on trying.

37:45.040 --> 37:46.800
Keep on vibing and keeping it tight.

37:46.800 --> 37:48.000
Keep it so, so tight.

Bullseye is all about discovering the good stuff in culture that will do nothing less

37:57.680 --> 37:59.360
than change your life.

37:59.360 --> 38:00.960
You know, I've never heard anything like it before.

38:00.960 --> 38:05.920
It'd be like seeing a new color, which I guess is music's like biggest asset is that you

38:05.920 --> 38:06.800
can hear new sounds.

38:06.800 --> 38:08.160
I'll probably never see a new color.

38:08.160 --> 38:13.600
I'll probably never experience like a new crazy taste, but I'll hear new sounds constantly.

38:14.160 --> 38:16.640
Culture picks, comedy and in-depth interviews.

38:16.640 --> 38:24.400
It's the good stuff and just the good stuff in popular culture every week on Bullseye.

38:28.880 --> 38:29.520
Hi, brothers.

38:29.520 --> 38:33.760
There's a cute sign shaker girl on the corner a few miles from my house and I want to ask

38:33.760 --> 38:34.080
her out.

38:34.080 --> 38:34.640
What the fuck?

38:34.640 --> 38:38.160
My question is how to approach her.

38:38.160 --> 38:40.880
I'm assuming pulling up in my car is out of the question.

38:40.880 --> 38:42.080
Good instinct.

38:42.080 --> 38:44.880
And she's surrounded by empty plots of land.

38:44.880 --> 38:47.120
So there's no other reason for me to be there.

38:47.120 --> 38:47.760
Wait, hold on.

38:47.760 --> 38:49.200
What's the sign for?

38:49.200 --> 38:50.240
Here's one good tip.

38:50.960 --> 38:56.080
Don't admit to be the sort of person that notices empty plots of land.

38:56.080 --> 38:59.920
I don't want to survey before asking someone out on a date.

38:59.920 --> 39:01.520
I have some clean routes of exit.

39:03.200 --> 39:06.160
Is her sign for the empty plots of land?

39:06.720 --> 39:07.760
Look at all these plots.

39:09.920 --> 39:10.800
Please buy one.

39:11.760 --> 39:12.720
Absolutely.

39:12.720 --> 39:16.640
This town is collapsing.

39:16.640 --> 39:17.920
Maybe she's starting a new town.

39:19.360 --> 39:20.880
Help me buy one into Sunville.

39:21.440 --> 39:22.720
Help me buy these plots.

39:22.720 --> 39:24.080
I'm starting Huntington Jr.

39:26.080 --> 39:30.320
Can you help me approach her and strike up a conversation in the least awkward way possible?

39:30.320 --> 39:33.680
This is from Seeking Signs in San Jose and the answer is no.

39:34.880 --> 39:37.680
Well, I think you just got to make your own sign that says

39:37.680 --> 39:41.200
want a date and then stand across the street from her and spin it.

39:41.200 --> 39:41.440
No.

39:41.440 --> 39:41.920
No?

39:43.120 --> 39:44.560
I won't do it.

39:44.560 --> 39:48.240
None of this is gonna do it for me, guys.

39:48.240 --> 39:51.920
What if you can deeply impress her with your sign spinning skills and she's like,

39:51.920 --> 39:52.960
oh, you're the one.

39:52.960 --> 39:59.120
I have a rule and I think we've talked about people treating like bank teller windows

39:59.120 --> 40:03.680
like a lady zoo where they just pick the lady that they want to ask out because-

40:03.680 --> 40:05.200
Which is fucking horrible.

40:05.200 --> 40:06.480
It's horrible.

40:06.480 --> 40:07.040
Sign marriage.

40:07.040 --> 40:08.000
Here's my new rule, okay?

40:08.000 --> 40:15.120
Don't ask anyone out if they are not in a position where they cannot turn on heel

40:15.120 --> 40:17.120
and break into a full sprint.

40:17.120 --> 40:21.520
If they're not permitted to turn around and run away from you,

40:22.160 --> 40:25.680
then I don't think that you are able to ask a person out.

40:25.680 --> 40:27.280
But I mean, this is my opinion.

40:27.280 --> 40:33.920
There's so many fucking layers to this that are like crazy for you to even have the impulse

40:34.560 --> 40:36.400
to I want to ask this person out.

40:36.400 --> 40:38.240
They could be married.

40:38.240 --> 40:40.000
You don't know their sexual orientation.

40:40.000 --> 40:40.640
They could be terrible.

40:40.640 --> 40:41.680
They could be horrible.

40:42.240 --> 40:47.280
Okay, but that's not specific to people with signs.

40:47.280 --> 40:48.560
That could be anyone.

40:48.560 --> 40:54.720
I guarantee you, and sorry question asker, you haven't spoken with this sign person.

40:54.720 --> 40:56.560
No, because they don't know how to.

40:56.560 --> 40:59.520
Yeah, you have driven past thought, man, she's cute.

41:00.080 --> 41:05.200
And now you've built up this whole narrative in your head about why you should ask her out.

41:05.200 --> 41:07.120
But you know nothing about her.

41:07.120 --> 41:08.240
It's not like everybody.

41:08.240 --> 41:11.840
No, no, Justin, because everybody because maybe you meet someone at a party

41:11.840 --> 41:14.400
and you have a conversation with them and then you want to ask them out.

41:14.400 --> 41:17.120
You have that so profoundly different.

41:17.120 --> 41:18.000
All three of us.

41:18.000 --> 41:18.800
It's not everybody.

41:18.800 --> 41:22.160
All three of us didn't meet our wives when they were sign dancing.

41:22.880 --> 41:27.600
Yes, I'm saying that like there's such a huge difference between talking to someone for

41:27.600 --> 41:32.080
even only 10 minutes and just driving by and noticing that they're cute.

41:32.080 --> 41:32.960
Check this out.

41:32.960 --> 41:34.640
Check this out.

41:34.640 --> 41:36.080
She's at Little Caesars, right?

41:36.080 --> 41:38.320
Obviously, she's working a Little Caesars.

41:38.320 --> 41:42.480
You go into Little Caesars, you get a hot, you don't know when she's getting off work,

41:42.480 --> 41:45.360
but you'll have to come back in to leave the sign inside.

41:45.360 --> 41:50.400
You go into Little Caesars, you buy a hot and ready za, sit there at a table with the hot

41:50.400 --> 41:54.640
and ready za, wait for her to come in with a plan when she comes in.

41:54.640 --> 41:56.720
Be like, oh, this za is too big.

41:57.360 --> 41:59.280
I can't, I'll never finish on my own.

41:59.280 --> 42:01.520
I hope someone will help me finish this za.

42:01.520 --> 42:04.480
Well, no, then you look like a za coward.

42:04.480 --> 42:04.960
What?

42:04.960 --> 42:05.920
A za coward.

42:05.920 --> 42:06.800
I can't do it.

42:07.360 --> 42:08.560
What was I thinking?

42:08.560 --> 42:09.680
Couldn't do it, huh, pussy?

42:09.680 --> 42:11.360
I'm never dating you, she'll say.

42:12.880 --> 42:13.760
Here's the thing, though.

42:15.040 --> 42:20.400
If she bites into that za and it's not hot and or ready, she's going to know your game.

42:20.400 --> 42:24.080
So I need you to temp check the pizza every few minutes.

42:24.080 --> 42:27.680
If it stops being hot, you have to throw it in the garbage and buy another one.

42:27.680 --> 42:28.800
What if it stops being ready?

42:28.800 --> 42:34.240
If it stops being ready, then time has come unstuck, and that is equally bad.

42:34.240 --> 42:36.800
You open it, it's just dough and tomatoes.

42:36.800 --> 42:37.760
And then you're a baby.

42:40.400 --> 42:43.360
Hi, my name's Benjamin Button, and I'd really like to date you.

42:43.360 --> 42:48.320
You just wrote a blockbuster sci-fi erotic thriller, and you didn't even realize it.

42:49.600 --> 42:51.760
Under the Crust, starring Scarlett Johansson.

42:51.760 --> 43:00.720
And the Oscars go to- wait, Oscars?

43:00.720 --> 43:01.920
Yeah, all the Oscars.

43:01.920 --> 43:03.440
They're going to Under the Crust this year.

43:04.400 --> 43:05.280
Come on up, Justin.

43:07.200 --> 43:08.640
Is Mystic Pizza taken?

43:09.200 --> 43:10.960
It is taken, unfortunately.

43:10.960 --> 43:12.800
Mystic Pizza 2 is not.

43:12.800 --> 43:13.440
There you go.

43:13.440 --> 43:14.960
Don't ask people out at work.

43:14.960 --> 43:18.880
You could stare at that pizza for an hour and never know it's Daniel Day-Lewis.

43:18.880 --> 43:22.480
Not in a million years, would you guess?

43:22.480 --> 43:23.600
So transformative.

43:23.600 --> 43:27.200
But he was difficult to work with because he insisted that people eat him while he was on set.

43:28.960 --> 43:34.240
Don't ask people out at work, especially when their job is sign dancing.

43:34.880 --> 43:37.440
She's got enough on her plate to deal with, you know what I mean?

43:37.440 --> 43:41.360
She's trying to get out of this one horse town, away from all these empty plots of land.

43:42.400 --> 43:43.040
Leave her alone.

43:43.920 --> 43:44.720
And I'm sure you're great.

43:44.720 --> 43:49.040
Maybe you guys really would connect, but not in this circumstance.

43:49.040 --> 43:50.800
All right, guys, I have a question.

43:50.800 --> 43:51.040
Okay.

43:52.320 --> 43:58.960
If Daniel Day-Lewis was in character as a pizza in the movie Under the Crust,

44:00.400 --> 44:08.560
and he's off set and a PA comes up, sees a pizza, and takes a slice out of Daniel Day-Lewis,

44:08.560 --> 44:15.440
would he be so committed to being in character that he would not disabuse

44:15.440 --> 44:21.280
this person of the notion that he's a pizza, or would he just let someone eat a slice of him?

44:21.920 --> 44:24.000
It depends on what slice they're getting, right?

44:24.000 --> 44:25.760
You know what the most delicious part would be, right?

44:27.200 --> 44:27.760
What part?

44:27.760 --> 44:28.720
His left foot.

44:28.720 --> 44:29.920
Come on, come on.

44:29.920 --> 44:31.840
That was fucking, that was easy.

44:31.840 --> 44:33.360
That was the easiest.

44:33.360 --> 44:34.800
Guess I'll remember that movie, right?

44:34.800 --> 44:35.520
My left foot.

44:35.520 --> 44:37.440
Oh, God.

44:37.440 --> 44:40.000
It's better than the Pizza the Hut joke I was going to make.

44:40.000 --> 44:42.160
Yeah, Travis, because I don't believe he was in that film.

44:43.920 --> 44:45.920
No, but it's about a human pizza.

44:47.040 --> 44:48.480
Spaceballs is about Pizza the Hut.

44:48.480 --> 44:51.520
I'm doing Yahoo now, and there's nothing you can do to stop me.

44:51.520 --> 44:54.960
Jaws isn't about a shark, and Spaceballs is about Pizza the Hut.

44:56.160 --> 45:00.480
This Yahoo was sent in by a friend of the show,

45:00.480 --> 45:02.240
Emerald member Shaman Drew Davenport.

45:02.240 --> 45:03.040
Thank you, Drew.

45:03.040 --> 45:05.920
It's by Yahoo Answers user Angela, who asks,

45:05.920 --> 45:09.040
how to moan loud without being heard?

45:10.480 --> 45:12.880
Is there a way I can moan as loud as I can

45:12.880 --> 45:14.960
without being heard by my parents?

45:14.960 --> 45:16.640
What can I do to achieve this?

45:16.640 --> 45:17.360
Any tips?

45:17.360 --> 45:17.760
Thanks.

45:19.120 --> 45:21.680
No, you don't remember what it's like out there.

45:22.320 --> 45:23.840
No, but here's the thing.

45:25.440 --> 45:26.960
All of this makes me icky.

45:28.080 --> 45:31.520
It's just, it's, okay, here's what bothers me the most

45:31.520 --> 45:33.760
about the phrasing of the question is,

45:33.760 --> 45:36.880
if you are consciously going into it and say,

45:36.880 --> 45:40.160
I'm gonna, I want to be as loud as I can,

45:40.160 --> 45:41.760
it seems disingenuous to me.

45:44.640 --> 45:47.920
My problem with it is, I don't like premeditated moaning.

45:47.920 --> 45:48.640
That's what I'm saying.

45:49.200 --> 45:50.320
That skeezes me out.

45:50.320 --> 45:52.960
But if you don't pre, if she doesn't pre-plan it,

45:53.760 --> 45:55.440
then when the moment comes, she's just gonna do it,

45:55.440 --> 45:56.960
and she's gonna get caught, of course.

45:56.960 --> 45:59.440
I hate the idea that at any point during my day,

45:59.440 --> 46:02.560
if I meet a man or woman that somewhere in the back

46:02.560 --> 46:05.200
of their head, they're thinking, I'm gonna moan tonight.

46:05.200 --> 46:08.240
I'm gonna do some, I'm gonna do some, like,

46:08.240 --> 46:08.720
I'm just trying to go about my day-to-day life.

46:08.720 --> 46:11.120
I need to get an acoustical engineer in here

46:11.120 --> 46:12.960
and figure out how loud I can be.

46:12.960 --> 46:14.560
I gotta moan tonight.

46:14.560 --> 46:16.880
It's gonna be a time to moan.

46:16.880 --> 46:18.480
Like, I'm just trying to live my life,

46:18.480 --> 46:21.280
and if I could, like, keep that question out of strangers' heads

46:21.280 --> 46:23.760
as I'm trying to just, like, go about my business

46:23.760 --> 46:26.480
and hit up the Jiffy Lube and ask for donations

46:26.480 --> 46:28.720
for my church group, like, while you're thinking

46:28.720 --> 46:32.720
about how hard you're gonna moan, I really appreciate it.

46:33.920 --> 46:36.400
I actually thought of the best answer, though.

46:37.360 --> 46:40.240
I thought of a good answer, and now I'm gonna feel guilty

46:40.240 --> 46:42.720
saying it, because you guys are trying to moan shame me.

46:43.440 --> 46:45.200
No, you go ahead, because I've got an answer, too,

46:45.200 --> 46:47.040
and I think we might be thinking the same thing.

46:47.840 --> 46:52.400
My answer is, when you moan, you have to moan,

46:52.400 --> 46:56.000
as loud as you can, the melody to the song Tarzan Boy

46:56.000 --> 46:56.880
by Baltimore.

46:56.880 --> 46:59.200
We are not saying the same thing at all.

46:59.200 --> 47:00.080
Oh, shit, okay.

47:00.080 --> 47:04.960
But I'm saying, if you get your moan on with a partner

47:04.960 --> 47:08.000
and you, like, oh, oh, boy, oh.

47:12.960 --> 47:14.720
Then your parents are just gonna be like,

47:14.720 --> 47:16.560
here she goes again with Baltimore.

47:16.560 --> 47:18.240
Man, she fucking loves that song.

47:19.120 --> 47:20.160
Can you update it?

47:22.960 --> 47:23.920
Can I tell you something?

47:23.920 --> 47:26.400
Every time I hear that song, I think it's gonna be Tarzan Boy.

47:26.400 --> 47:28.080
I get excited for, like, a second.

47:28.080 --> 47:29.440
I get fucking excited for a second.

47:29.440 --> 47:31.280
I'm like, fucking Baltimore is back?

47:31.280 --> 47:32.880
Why are they playing this in the Chipotle?

47:32.880 --> 47:34.000
Ah, fucking, it's that.

47:36.560 --> 47:36.960
That one.

47:36.960 --> 47:37.600
It's that one.

47:39.680 --> 47:40.960
Travis, what was yours?

47:40.960 --> 47:43.840
I was gonna say, and it's gonna take a little work,

47:44.640 --> 47:46.240
but maybe just make, like, cue cards.

47:47.120 --> 47:47.760
Cue cards?

47:47.760 --> 47:50.320
Like, in the fucking Love Actually film?

47:50.320 --> 47:52.720
You just, like, hold up a sign that just says, like,

47:52.720 --> 47:54.640
whoa, right?

47:54.640 --> 47:56.480
But you don't say it, but you, like, put it

47:56.480 --> 47:58.160
in the face of your partner.

47:58.160 --> 47:59.040
Pleasure.

47:59.040 --> 48:00.320
I just want you to know, and, like,

48:00.320 --> 48:02.080
point to it really emphatically.

48:02.080 --> 48:03.760
It's like, this now.

48:03.760 --> 48:05.200
This now is what I'm feeling.

48:05.200 --> 48:08.160
And maybe, like, do it, like, in the, like, glitter and glue.

48:08.160 --> 48:08.400
Yeah.

48:08.400 --> 48:10.080
Like, it really shows that you put some time in,

48:10.080 --> 48:12.320
not just, like, a Sharpie on poster board,

48:12.320 --> 48:13.920
but maybe, like, make it a thing.

48:13.920 --> 48:15.520
Like, a diorama of pleasure.

48:16.640 --> 48:18.800
Have one that says, like, too much teeth.

48:18.800 --> 48:19.680
Little to the left.

48:20.240 --> 48:21.200
Night to night.

48:21.200 --> 48:21.920
Give me the other.

48:21.920 --> 48:22.960
Give me the other.

48:22.960 --> 48:25.600
You can have that on one.

48:25.600 --> 48:27.600
We want a pitcher, not a belly itcher.

48:28.640 --> 48:30.880
And then you can use it for multiple occasions.

48:30.880 --> 48:33.120
Why do you have a sign that says John 316?

48:33.120 --> 48:34.400
What am I supposed to get out of that?

48:36.560 --> 48:37.760
Just don't mix those up.

48:37.760 --> 48:40.640
Do not take that to WrestleMania 48.

48:40.640 --> 48:42.400
And then just, like, hold up a big sign

48:42.400 --> 48:44.160
when the rock is suplexed.

48:44.160 --> 48:46.960
And it says, like, I'm coming real good on it.

48:48.240 --> 48:50.240
I love the way you're using your wieners.

48:50.240 --> 48:53.040
And be super careful, be super double careful

48:53.040 --> 48:55.120
if you're a member of the Westboro Baptist Church.

48:55.120 --> 48:58.480
Because you are headed towards some really sticky territory.

49:00.240 --> 49:01.840
I'm getting mixed signals.

49:01.840 --> 49:03.840
Are you protesting or are you a big fan?

49:03.840 --> 49:06.320
If you hold up a sign that says I'm in sticky territory,

49:07.200 --> 49:08.400
it's going to be bad news bears.

49:08.400 --> 49:09.600
Well, it's going to be good news bears

49:09.600 --> 49:10.320
because you're terrible.

49:12.240 --> 49:12.960
We done with the show?

49:14.000 --> 49:15.360
I think that's the end of the show.

49:16.240 --> 49:18.960
We got to wrap up because you got to get Travis to Huntington.

49:18.960 --> 49:19.600
I got to travel.

49:19.600 --> 49:21.280
Travis, are you guys bringing lasagna or what?

49:22.160 --> 49:24.400
We're bringing lasagna and a sweet treat.

49:24.400 --> 49:25.200
Oh, thank God.

49:26.560 --> 49:28.320
Did you have a baby just so your brothers

49:28.320 --> 49:29.360
would keep bringing you food?

49:30.240 --> 49:30.560
Yes.

49:31.200 --> 49:31.840
Nice.

49:31.840 --> 49:34.480
I'm still waiting on another one of those pies, by the way, here.

49:34.480 --> 49:35.520
Well, I got you one.

49:35.520 --> 49:36.720
Travis has gotten you no pies.

49:37.600 --> 49:39.200
I baked you a sweet treat.

49:39.200 --> 49:42.080
I baked you a sweet treat with my own hands.

49:44.640 --> 49:45.920
So this has been our show.

49:45.920 --> 49:48.000
Fantasy Football Bros.

49:48.000 --> 49:49.200
Fantasy Football Bros.

49:49.200 --> 49:53.920
I wish everybody the biggest touchdowns and great performances from your running back.

49:53.920 --> 49:58.560
I hope it's better than soft-headed Eddie Lacey with his stupid concussion.

49:58.560 --> 50:02.080
I hope you don't have him because he's got a soft head.

50:02.640 --> 50:05.600
If you can get a professional football player to tweet about our show this week,

50:05.600 --> 50:11.120
make sure you give them the bit.ly forward slash mbmbam2013

50:11.120 --> 50:17.920
mbmbam2013 or it's mbmbam that bit.ly forward slash it's mbmbam that works too.

50:17.920 --> 50:19.680
Those will lead you to samplers.

50:19.680 --> 50:23.440
I think that's the best way to get pro football players to tweet about our show

50:23.440 --> 50:24.560
and try to get them into it.

50:24.560 --> 50:29.120
If we get one pro football player into it, that would be all I need.

50:29.120 --> 50:30.320
I don't even need a starter.

50:30.320 --> 50:32.320
I'm perfectly happy with a second string.

50:32.320 --> 50:33.280
Yeah, no problem at all.

50:33.280 --> 50:37.760
If I could get a Fozzie Whitaker retweet, fuck me, it's over.

50:37.760 --> 50:43.520
It's over. Everybody just tell Matthew Barry and then I think he can connect us to some other people.

50:45.280 --> 50:49.200
Thank you to people tweeting about the show like Devon Brews, Joshua Doolan, Monochron,

50:50.320 --> 50:57.840
EKS, Spencer, Jen, Bradley Smith, Michael Silva, Sean McNally, Michael Taylor, Wes, Ovens, Honeyboy,

50:58.560 --> 51:02.000
Doyle, Swinimer, many other.

51:02.000 --> 51:05.440
A lot of people, somebody made a Glass Shark video, which I guess we probably-

51:05.440 --> 51:06.240
That was me.

51:06.240 --> 51:08.160
Oh, you did it. Good job, Trav.

51:08.160 --> 51:08.960
Thank you.

51:08.960 --> 51:10.080
You can watch that if you want.

51:10.880 --> 51:13.920
It's on our YouTube, MBMBAM is the channel.

51:14.880 --> 51:17.440
Yeah, I just pulled that audio out, pulled that clip out.

51:17.440 --> 51:22.640
Here's a nice comment on the Glass Shark video from the Arthur Dent.

51:23.600 --> 51:25.680
God, Justin can really keep a bit going.

51:25.680 --> 51:26.640
Yeah, sure.

51:26.640 --> 51:27.840
Sounds a little judgy.

51:27.840 --> 51:28.800
Sounds a little judgy here.

51:28.800 --> 51:30.320
He can really keep that ball up in the air.

51:31.360 --> 51:32.960
But yeah, go check out our YouTube channel.

51:32.960 --> 51:36.960
I try to, if there's a bit that everybody really likes, pull the audio out of it so

51:36.960 --> 51:38.240
that you can share it with your friends.

51:38.240 --> 51:42.080
Just a little bit more digestible and listenable for people who haven't listened before.

51:43.040 --> 51:45.840
It's where the samplers are.

51:45.840 --> 51:49.040
We've got a couple animated videos on there that were made by a couple different friends

51:49.040 --> 51:49.920
of the show.

51:49.920 --> 51:50.720
Highly recommend it.

51:50.720 --> 51:51.280
Really check them out.

51:51.280 --> 51:54.880
We're trying to do more and more stuff on there.

51:54.880 --> 51:58.160
So yeah, go subscribe and share the videos with your friends.

51:58.160 --> 52:03.360
Also, the Facebook group is just really, really hopping right now.

52:03.360 --> 52:05.280
It's amazing to me, the number of people that...

52:05.280 --> 52:06.560
Yeah, it's really catching on.

52:07.120 --> 52:11.600
Like, I think we've approved over 500 people in the last week to join the group.

52:11.600 --> 52:12.400
We have?

52:13.280 --> 52:14.800
Well, I did 114.

52:14.800 --> 52:15.360
Okay.

52:15.840 --> 52:17.360
There's so many, and I love it.

52:17.360 --> 52:22.400
I love that the group is blowing up, but we're talking about like, I approved like almost

52:22.400 --> 52:25.600
500 people in one day, and it was like an afternoon.

52:25.600 --> 52:27.360
It's called My Brother, My Brother, Me.

52:27.360 --> 52:31.040
My Brother, My Brother, Me Appreciation Group, if you're having trouble finding it.

52:32.080 --> 52:32.400
Please.

52:32.400 --> 52:38.960
On there, Elijah Granite posted like a little survey of what's your favorite segments on

52:38.960 --> 52:39.360
the show.

52:39.920 --> 52:43.920
Leading it right now, just so everyone knows, and everybody needs to go weigh in on it.

52:43.920 --> 52:44.480
Yahoo!

52:44.480 --> 52:47.120
Slash Yadruz is leading it.

52:47.120 --> 52:48.960
That's not a segment as much as it is like...

52:49.600 --> 52:50.240
A thing that we do.

52:50.240 --> 52:50.400
Yeah.

52:51.280 --> 52:52.720
Second, normal questions.

52:53.520 --> 52:55.360
Third, D&D special apps.

52:55.360 --> 52:57.600
Fourth, Sad Libs.

52:58.960 --> 52:59.600
Out of four?

52:59.600 --> 53:00.320
That's ironic.

53:00.320 --> 53:00.640
Yeah.

53:00.640 --> 53:06.640
Sad Libs over opening goofs, cold opens, extreme restraints, money zone, and final question.

53:06.640 --> 53:08.240
Sad Libs in fourth place.

53:08.240 --> 53:10.320
How many shell accounts did you create?

53:11.360 --> 53:11.840
Twelve.

53:11.840 --> 53:12.080
Okay.

53:13.520 --> 53:15.280
Okay, time out.

53:15.280 --> 53:21.200
Griffin, we've been having fucking bandwidth issues this entire episode, and Griffin has

53:21.200 --> 53:28.240
decided to make his- turn his Skype icon into a screen share of him watching Baltimore's

53:28.240 --> 53:28.880
Tarzan.

53:30.320 --> 53:31.040
Really, Griffin?

53:31.920 --> 53:32.240
Really?

53:35.680 --> 53:37.120
It is a good song, though.

53:37.120 --> 53:38.640
It's a fucking great song.

53:39.600 --> 53:42.960
I've never seen the music video before, and I feel like I'm on heroin right now.

53:45.600 --> 53:46.880
Thank you to everybody who listened.

53:46.880 --> 53:49.920
Thanks to John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song into Departure

53:49.920 --> 53:51.200
off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

53:51.200 --> 53:55.920
I don't know if you guys got this, but I got a LinkedIn invitation from John Roderick

53:56.560 --> 54:00.800
on the LinkedIn platform, and I very much look forward to doing great business with him.

54:02.240 --> 54:04.560
And thanks again to MeUndies for supporting the show.

54:05.280 --> 54:06.560
Go check out MeUndies.

54:06.560 --> 54:11.200

54:11.200 --> 54:12.640

54:13.200 --> 54:17.440
I also want to thank MeUndies for giving me the chance to say the phrase MeUndies like

54:17.440 --> 54:18.400
34 times.

54:18.400 --> 54:21.600
Yeah, that is the main service they provide.

54:22.320 --> 54:23.680
They just let you say that.

54:23.680 --> 54:24.960
Do you guys want to find out Yahoo?

54:25.840 --> 54:28.640
Go listen to the other Max Fun Shows, by the way, if you haven't.

54:29.360 --> 54:32.000
There's some really, really, really good ones.

54:32.000 --> 54:33.920
I've been catching up on my Throw in Shade lately.

54:35.040 --> 54:38.800
It's Jordan Jesse Goh, Josh John Hodgman, Stop Podcasting Yourself, The Goose Down,

54:38.800 --> 54:41.200
Lady to Lady, Saw Bones.

54:42.480 --> 54:44.000
Oh no, Ross and Carrie?

54:44.000 --> 54:45.040
One Bad Mother?

54:45.040 --> 54:48.880
If you didn't listen to last week's Saw Bones, it was a very special episode.

54:48.880 --> 54:52.080
I was very, very proud of Justin Sidney for putting that one up.

54:52.640 --> 54:56.000
There are probably better places to start if you've never listened before, but a lot

54:56.000 --> 55:00.240
of people responded favorably to that.

55:00.800 --> 55:01.840
Yeah, including me.

55:01.840 --> 55:02.720
I'm going to weigh in right now.

55:04.000 --> 55:05.920
I favored it.

55:05.920 --> 55:07.680
Speaking of, thanks again to everybody.

55:08.240 --> 55:12.560
We got such a great response to the Adventure Zone episode, and everybody's been really

55:12.560 --> 55:14.240
complimentary of it.

55:14.240 --> 55:15.280
So I just want to say thank you.

55:15.280 --> 55:16.880
I'm glad everybody enjoyed it so much.

55:16.880 --> 55:19.520
I hope there's more of those.

55:19.520 --> 55:20.640
Yeah, I do too, geez.

55:21.440 --> 55:27.120
Maybe we should ask for help with the name.

55:27.120 --> 55:29.600
Maybe we can do that in the appreciation group.

55:29.600 --> 55:31.120
We can make a poll or something.

55:31.760 --> 55:33.520
I really like the Adventure Zone.

55:33.520 --> 55:36.880
I think we could really capitalize on that, but I think we've gotten a few others.

55:36.880 --> 55:39.200
Somebody said, my dungeons, my dragons, and me.

55:39.200 --> 55:41.440
It's great, but I don't really want to tie it.

55:41.440 --> 55:42.800
I hit Griffin with this this week.

55:42.800 --> 55:45.520
What do you think about Gerblin's A Family Adventure?

55:46.560 --> 55:47.280
I kind of like that.

55:47.280 --> 55:47.840
I don't know that.

55:47.840 --> 55:49.600
Gerblin's has an exclamation point.

55:49.600 --> 55:54.320
It sounds a little bit like Joseph Gerbils, which worries me a little bit.

55:54.960 --> 55:56.720
Okay, we'll have to think about it.

55:58.000 --> 55:59.440
I mean, we don't have to think about it.

55:59.440 --> 56:02.160
It sounds a lot like Joseph Gerbils, so maybe we shouldn't do that.

56:06.480 --> 56:08.640
Anyway, how about we close it out with the final Yahoo?

56:09.280 --> 56:09.920
Yes.

56:09.920 --> 56:11.840
This Yahoo Drew was sent in by Drew Davenport.

56:11.840 --> 56:12.320
Thank you, Drew.

56:12.320 --> 56:15.200
It's by Yahoo Answers user Thurston Gordon, who asks,

56:17.520 --> 56:20.320
why is Blade Runner called Blade Runner?

56:20.320 --> 56:23.040
There are no blades, and most people drive in the movie.

56:25.840 --> 56:26.800
I'm Justin McElroy.

56:26.800 --> 56:27.680
I'm Travis McElroy.

56:27.680 --> 56:28.880
I'm Griffin McElroy.

56:28.880 --> 56:30.560
This has been My Brother, My Brother Made Kiss Your Dad.

56:30.560 --> 56:43.600
The score there on the lips.

57:00.560 --> 57:04.400
Tower marker, brawling Brandy Posey, and Barbara May Day Gray.

57:04.400 --> 57:07.680
Listen as they throw down with comedy heavyweights like Aisha Tyler,

57:07.680 --> 57:09.440
Retta, Kate Flannery, and more.

57:09.440 --> 57:13.600
These ladies will make you laugh so hard you will literally explode.

57:14.400 --> 57:20.160
So go to MaximumFun.org or iTunes and download Lady Da Lady before it's too late.

57:20.800 --> 57:22.240
Wait, where's the, where's the music?

57:22.240 --> 57:22.960
What happened?

57:22.960 --> 57:23.840
My throat hurts.

57:23.840 --> 57:26.000
I don't know what to do.

57:26.000 --> 57:27.040
Should we just get coffee?

57:27.040 --> 57:31.200
Okay.
