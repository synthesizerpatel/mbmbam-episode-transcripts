00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:50.160
Hello and welcome to the McElroy Brothers brand expansion quarterly report.

00:50.160 --> 00:55.600
I am your oldest chief financial officer, Justin McElroy.

00:55.600 --> 00:58.960
I'm your middlest head of HR, Travis McElroy.

00:58.960 --> 01:07.840
And I am digital profit, Shingy. I go by Shingy now, because I'm a digital profit.

01:08.560 --> 01:17.440
Gosh, what an exciting Q4 it's been for McElroy Industries. We already had the My Brother,

01:17.440 --> 01:25.600
My Brother, Me, and Sawbones franchises under the tent pole, big tent pole business, as I say.

01:25.600 --> 01:32.000
And we welcome three new franchises into the umbrella that we think-

01:32.000 --> 01:33.360
Closing the gap.

01:33.360 --> 01:41.440
Closing the gap, opening the kimono, and just checking out the profits on our new properties.

01:42.240 --> 01:45.760
We're going to go to Travis. We'll get to your calls in just a second. We're going to go to

01:45.760 --> 01:51.760
Travis. First off, tell us about the project he's leading, just a quick-

01:51.760 --> 01:59.120
I'm very excited. Bunker Buddies, the survival comedy podcast. It's looking great. Product

01:59.120 --> 02:04.000
integration is through the roof. I'm talking about rice primarily. We have a lot of rice backers.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.360
How's your dividends?

02:05.360 --> 02:09.840
The dividends are great. My partner, Andy, and I are just rolling in dividends,

02:09.840 --> 02:14.000
swimming in dividends like Scrooge McDuck. We're very excited about all the dividends.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.120
Do you get any bonds?

02:15.120 --> 02:16.000
We've got bonds and dividends.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.280
How are your options?

02:17.280 --> 02:19.040
Options, we have them.

02:19.040 --> 02:20.480
How's your bond options?

02:20.480 --> 02:24.240
Our bond options, we're going to go see Spectre. All the bond options are there.

02:24.240 --> 02:28.720
Travis, that's a podcast about surviving the apocalypse, a comedy show about the end of the

02:28.720 --> 02:28.880
world.

02:28.880 --> 02:29.520
That is correct.

02:30.080 --> 02:36.800
Great. I want to just real quick weigh in on a brand I'm representing here. It's the three of us

02:36.800 --> 02:42.320
on this call plus our sweet daddy playing Dungeons and Dragons. It's called the Adventure Zone. That

02:42.320 --> 02:45.600
hot property was just launched on Thursday.

02:45.600 --> 02:47.280
Big dividends on that one.

02:47.280 --> 02:49.280
Big dividends.

02:49.280 --> 02:56.000
Huge dividends. Number one comedy podcast on iTunes. Suck it, Miss Williams. I guess I did

02:56.000 --> 02:56.880
do something.

02:56.880 --> 03:00.000
Number one dadcast on the net.

03:00.000 --> 03:09.040
Number one cast with our daddy ever in history. That's been big. Then, Griffin, you had a brand

03:09.040 --> 03:09.120
to talk to us about.

03:09.120 --> 03:18.880
I had a whole new brand launching on Guytoons, which is a deep web iTunes application. Not a

03:18.880 --> 03:20.880
lot of people have access to-

03:22.320 --> 03:23.760
You can only get it with the Guypod.

03:23.760 --> 03:31.680
You have to have the first generation Guypod circa 1998 to listen to it. Despite those

03:31.680 --> 03:42.080
limitations, the dividends on this podcast, which I have titled my Vore and Japanese Electronica

03:42.080 --> 03:51.760
podcast about Vore, which I have titled Big Gulp.

03:51.760 --> 03:57.360
Griffin, let me say right off the bat, congratulations on getting the rights to use the 7-Eleven

03:57.360 --> 03:59.760
logo with that. Congratulations.

03:59.760 --> 04:07.600
I was going to get Justin Russo, one of our lead artistic brand managers, or Justin Gray,

04:07.600 --> 04:12.000
artistic brand manager for the Adventure Zone on this one, but you know what I said? Fuck

04:12.000 --> 04:16.880
it. Fuck it. 7-Eleven already did the work. I'm going to put them on, slap them on the

04:16.880 --> 04:22.240
Big Gulp lunch boxes and on the cups that I sell Slurpees out of. It's going to get

04:22.240 --> 04:23.520
really fucking confusing.

04:23.520 --> 04:24.640
Now, Griffin, is there anywhere-

04:24.640 --> 04:27.680
Can I just- But the dividends though.

04:28.320 --> 04:31.840
Is there anywhere anyone can find Big Gulp?

04:31.840 --> 04:39.280
Yeah, you have to have a good RSSS reader. You're going to plug-

04:39.280 --> 04:41.200
What are the S's stands for sex?

04:41.200 --> 04:48.560
You're going to plug this into your favorite RSSS application of your choosing, the following

04:48.560 --> 04:50.480
URL. P.

04:57.680 --> 04:59.280
One more time, Griffin. Can we get that one more time?

04:59.280 --> 05:02.080
P. That's it.

05:02.800 --> 05:04.960
Just P? So that is-

05:04.960 --> 05:11.760
There's not a lot of shit in the PSSSS system, so I locked down P.

05:11.760 --> 05:18.560
Big Gulp, Bunker Buddies, a lot of huge growth, and I think we can go ahead and just try-

05:19.840 --> 05:24.000
I guess we have to keep recording the flagship here.

05:24.000 --> 05:29.680
I'm honestly- I think we've about run into the ground, but the dividends-

05:29.680 --> 05:30.480
The dividends.

05:30.480 --> 05:32.080
The dividends, though.

05:32.080 --> 05:32.880
Damn it. Damn.

05:33.600 --> 05:35.360
Check out damn dividends, though.

05:35.360 --> 05:38.880
We're all- We're three Gordon Ramseys.

05:38.880 --> 05:40.160
Mm-hmm.

05:40.160 --> 05:43.040
We're three chunkier versions of Gordon Ramsey, not British.

05:43.040 --> 05:46.160
A few months ago, I started dating my best friend. Oh, this is my brother and my brother

05:46.160 --> 05:48.720
made some advice show for the modern era.

05:48.720 --> 05:49.520
You probably heard-

05:49.520 --> 05:51.280
It's our Adventure Zone fan cast.

05:51.280 --> 05:56.800
You will always- You will always be our first baby, and we will always love you the most.

05:56.800 --> 06:00.400
Let me just- Quick message to all my big gulpers out there.

06:00.400 --> 06:07.280
We might not talk about Vore on this show, so it might not be- It might be a little unexpected.

06:07.280 --> 06:08.800
That's how I talk.

06:08.800 --> 06:11.600
I hope this is somebody's first fucking my brother.

06:11.600 --> 06:12.320
Fuck off.

06:12.320 --> 06:18.320
Can you fucking even imagine what sort- You said this was funny.

06:18.320 --> 06:24.560
This was funny. David. David. David. It's Brian.

06:24.560 --> 06:28.880
You said this was funny, and it's just guys talking about their brand?

06:28.880 --> 06:36.160
I recognize one of the guys from Losing the Sheen, but it's not about Charlie Sheen at all, is it?

06:36.720 --> 06:42.320
And I recognize Griffin from a pod- You know what? I shouldn't- Forget I said anything.

06:42.880 --> 06:44.000
I don't want to mention-

06:44.000 --> 06:46.400
I'm going to go back to listening to In Case of Emergency.

06:46.400 --> 06:49.360
I love cereal.

06:49.360 --> 06:53.680
This line of goofing that we've been bringing on has really brought up how bad we are at

06:53.680 --> 06:54.960
keeping podcasts going.

06:55.920 --> 06:58.880
Listen, I guarantee- So enjoy Bunker Buddies and Adventure Zone

06:58.880 --> 07:00.320
and Big Gulp while they last.

07:00.320 --> 07:02.560
Yeah, and My Brother, My Brother and Me, for that matter.

07:03.680 --> 07:06.640
Nothing gold can- No gold dividends can stay.

07:06.640 --> 07:07.760
I'll never stop doing My Brother, My Brother and Me.

07:07.760 --> 07:09.600
No, fuck you. I don't care what I do without you two.

07:09.600 --> 07:11.840
Probably the goofs are my cold dead hands.

07:11.840 --> 07:13.920
I'll bring in Ashton Kutcher. I don't care.

07:13.920 --> 07:18.000
So this is an advice show if this is the first time you're listening,

07:18.000 --> 07:19.760
and this is where the show starts.

07:19.760 --> 07:21.120
This is the part of the show.

07:21.120 --> 07:24.080
The thing about My Brother, My Brother and Me, kind of a running gag,

07:24.080 --> 07:28.160
is the first five minutes of every episode of this program ever are un-listenable.

07:28.160 --> 07:29.120
It's barf garbage.

07:31.120 --> 07:33.760
It's how we lure in new listeners.

07:33.760 --> 07:35.280
Set the expectations low.

07:35.280 --> 07:39.120
That's our motto here at My Brother, My Brother and Me Institute.

07:39.120 --> 07:41.840
The only podcast brave enough to begin with hazing.

07:41.840 --> 07:45.760
Mm-hmm. And that's a premium swallow.

07:45.760 --> 07:48.560
Oh, sorry. Hold on. No, that's a big gulp.

07:49.200 --> 07:55.360
That's how I end every episode of Big Gulp.

07:55.360 --> 07:57.200
I have to fucking do it now.

07:57.200 --> 07:58.960
Now I have to fucking do a podcast.

07:58.960 --> 08:01.440
I'm gonna have to learn how to set up an RSS feed,

08:01.440 --> 08:03.920
and I'm gonna have to fucking create a podcast called Big Gulp.

08:04.880 --> 08:06.720
Open submission, I guess, for co-hosts.

08:06.720 --> 08:10.480
Can you have one- I just want one episode of Big Gulp.

08:10.480 --> 08:14.160
I'm not asking for the one, but I want it to like be in iTunes and everything.

08:14.160 --> 08:14.560
Yeah, sure.

08:14.560 --> 08:18.640
And I want to be number one forever, but I just only want one episode.

08:18.640 --> 08:19.040
Okay.

08:19.040 --> 08:19.680
Yeah.

08:19.680 --> 08:24.960
Big Gulp, the Vore show coming from Griffin McElroy and a co-host to be named later.

08:26.160 --> 08:28.880
And here's our advice to you, the listeners.

08:29.920 --> 08:31.920
Can we just do this show? This feels right.

08:34.400 --> 08:39.200
Just every once in a while making oblique references to your repugnant Vore show?

08:39.200 --> 08:41.760
I think my favorite episode was the one on what's eating Gilbert Grape.

08:46.400 --> 08:49.120
It was just 45 minutes of Griffin saying me.

08:51.680 --> 08:55.040
Okay, and now we do it.

08:55.040 --> 08:55.840
Now we do the damn thing.

08:55.840 --> 08:59.360
And now we get to the thing that you've been waiting for.

09:02.240 --> 09:02.800
Hopefully.

09:04.480 --> 09:05.440
Dim the lights.

09:05.440 --> 09:10.240
We're about to thump this melon.

09:10.240 --> 09:13.600
And now the starting lineup of my brother, my brother, me.

09:14.240 --> 09:15.120
Do the damn thing.

09:17.840 --> 09:23.040
If we were a sports team, what song would you guys want to come out onto the court with?

09:23.040 --> 09:24.320
He ain't heavy, he's my brother.

09:25.360 --> 09:26.320
Save the best for last.

09:27.440 --> 09:28.880
Being from night court.

09:28.880 --> 09:31.120
A few months ago, I started dating my best friend.

09:31.120 --> 09:33.760
He's the best ever and it's the happiest I've ever been.

09:33.760 --> 09:34.560
Show off.

09:34.560 --> 09:37.920
I'm totally in love with him and I'd like to tell him that.

09:38.880 --> 09:40.720
But this project needs some tweaking.

09:41.360 --> 09:46.320
We're both pretty goofy and the thought of grand romantic moment in which I declare my

09:46.320 --> 09:48.560
love makes me want to vomit.

09:49.200 --> 09:51.520
Sorry, makes me want to actually vomit.

09:51.520 --> 09:56.240
Can you think of a good way for me to tell him I love him that strikes a nice balance?

09:56.240 --> 09:58.400
And that's from ghost octopus.

10:00.480 --> 10:04.240
So I have a question for you guys because I thought about this when I was putting together

10:04.240 --> 10:04.880
the question list.

10:05.440 --> 10:08.400
Is it as simple as starting the sentence with hey?

10:10.320 --> 10:11.440
Hey, I love you.

10:12.400 --> 10:17.520
I mean, does that do it or does that make it seem like you're reminding them about a

10:17.520 --> 10:19.040
dentist appointment they have?

10:19.040 --> 10:20.240
Hey, I love you.

10:20.240 --> 10:20.800
Okay, great.

10:20.800 --> 10:21.280
Cool, cool, cool.

10:21.280 --> 10:25.280
Thank you for that first for the debut of that terminology.

10:25.280 --> 10:26.720
That seems a little cash.

10:26.720 --> 10:28.800
Yeah, seems a little cash right?

10:28.800 --> 10:29.840
I'm not sure about it.

10:30.480 --> 10:31.280
It seems a little.

10:31.280 --> 10:37.280
I if you're like me, you'll say it accidentally and then just try to go with it to like a

10:37.280 --> 10:39.680
banker on the phone.

10:40.880 --> 10:41.120
Thanks.

10:41.120 --> 10:42.080
I love you.

10:42.080 --> 10:43.440
I mean, fuck.

10:44.160 --> 10:45.200
Sorry, teacher.

10:45.200 --> 10:45.920
I mean, fuck.

10:48.400 --> 10:49.840
Yeah, I don't know what you do.

10:49.840 --> 10:54.400
I do feel like you need to strike a little bit of a balance and it doesn't have to be

10:54.400 --> 10:58.480
like you don't have to like paint it on an elephant that you stole for them.

10:58.480 --> 11:01.280
But I do think it needs to be better than what Travis said.

11:01.280 --> 11:02.000
Fair enough.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.560
Which sounded a little bleak for my taste.

11:04.560 --> 11:09.760
Maybe, maybe you just know, you know what, just do it when you feel it.

11:10.800 --> 11:11.360
You know what?

11:11.360 --> 11:15.360
I you're right, Griffin, because the thing is, like, whatever defines your relationship,

11:15.360 --> 11:20.720
if you guys are goofy together and have a good time, then it will come when you're having

11:20.720 --> 11:21.280
a good time.

11:21.280 --> 11:23.360
It doesn't have to be a grand romantic gesture.

11:23.360 --> 11:27.040
It should be in a moment where it's like, hey, this moment, perfect timing.

11:27.040 --> 11:31.280
This moment perfectly exemplifies why I fell in love with you.

11:31.280 --> 11:35.360
Everything you're doing right now, you're making me laugh till milk shot out of my nose

11:35.360 --> 11:39.760
or we're having a great time doing something that anyone else would think was stupid.

11:39.760 --> 11:41.840
This is the moment when I have to say it.

11:41.840 --> 11:43.120
Say it when you feel it.

11:43.920 --> 11:46.800
Next time you feel that love for that person, let him know.

11:47.680 --> 11:48.240
Let him in.

11:49.200 --> 11:50.640
Let him just know it.

11:50.640 --> 11:51.920
Let him in your heart.

11:51.920 --> 11:53.200
Just let him in your heart.

11:53.200 --> 11:56.640
Just say it when it bubbles up and you can't keep it in anymore.

11:56.640 --> 11:58.080
Just let it all spill out.

11:58.560 --> 12:09.120
Can I another stratagem is when you don't feel a toot coming on when you feel like maybe

12:09.840 --> 12:17.760
maybe after you just had one and it not immediately after, of course, but maybe give it like a

12:17.760 --> 12:18.960
three minute window.

12:18.960 --> 12:22.880
And if you feel like you're probably going to be cool for another three minutes, because

12:22.880 --> 12:26.640
everybody does it every six minutes, you want to try and split the uprights there and buy

12:26.640 --> 12:29.520
yourself as much breathing room as you can.

12:29.520 --> 12:30.880
So like in a toot window.

12:31.840 --> 12:34.320
Yeah, in the six minute toot window for sure.

12:34.320 --> 12:35.120
Pretty good call.

12:36.400 --> 12:39.600
If you if you're feeling it also in that window, perfect.

12:39.600 --> 12:43.200
The stars have aligned, but that might be too much to ask from your body.

12:43.200 --> 12:46.640
Is it a good way to get out of being caught in a toot?

12:46.640 --> 12:49.440
Like you just farted in front of him for the first time.

12:49.440 --> 12:50.240
I love you.

12:50.240 --> 12:50.960
I love you.

12:51.520 --> 12:51.760
What?

12:52.320 --> 12:54.640
Well, now we're talking about this instead of the fart.

12:55.200 --> 12:56.000
Got it.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.360
Oh, I thought you're saying you do it.

12:57.360 --> 12:58.720
And please, can we say toot instead?

12:59.920 --> 13:02.880
I thought you meant like you just say it real loud to disguise.

13:02.880 --> 13:04.320
Oh, to cover the toot.

13:04.320 --> 13:04.880
Yeah, sure.

13:06.560 --> 13:07.280
Have we ruined?

13:07.280 --> 13:08.640
Say it next time you're in trouble.

13:10.000 --> 13:13.920
When you do something wrong or the next time you're in trouble, like you're being attacked.

13:13.920 --> 13:17.760
I love you and hope that it calls to them and they come to your aid like Superman.

13:18.400 --> 13:18.900
Yeah.

13:20.560 --> 13:22.400
I'm not a big fan of sitting on it.

13:22.400 --> 13:24.240
I think now let me ask you guys this.

13:24.240 --> 13:29.840
Do you have to couch it in like it's OK if you don't want to if you're not ready for it?

13:29.840 --> 13:31.040
Oh, it doesn't sound like that's the problem.

13:32.000 --> 13:32.640
That's what I'm saying.

13:32.640 --> 13:33.920
They're already so far ahead of the curve.

13:34.720 --> 13:36.960
Like it doesn't sound like this person is going to get spooked.

13:36.960 --> 13:38.400
But I do understand what you're saying, Justin.

13:38.400 --> 13:42.880
I think just in general, that's like any kind of preface is is.

13:42.880 --> 13:48.560
Because I think that with that, what you're saying is you do actually have to say it back.

13:49.120 --> 13:53.440
I'm saying you don't have to say it back so that, you know, I'm expecting you to.

13:53.440 --> 13:54.640
Here's what I think you should do.

13:54.640 --> 13:57.760
Tell him, like, listen, no matter what I say in the next 30 seconds,

13:57.760 --> 14:02.240
I don't want you to say a fucking word, not a peep out of you.

14:02.240 --> 14:04.320
I don't care what you think or feel.

14:04.320 --> 14:06.320
I need you to just soak this in and process it.

14:06.320 --> 14:07.360
This moment's about me.

14:07.920 --> 14:09.280
This is about me.

14:09.280 --> 14:13.120
This is my moment to shine.

14:13.120 --> 14:13.920
Let's drink it in.

14:14.880 --> 14:18.720
I want you to sit on this for three minutes and then I'm going to go somewhere.

14:19.360 --> 14:20.880
And then I'll come right back.

14:20.880 --> 14:23.920
I've hired actor John Larquette to tell you that I love you.

14:23.920 --> 14:24.720
Don't say anything.

14:25.280 --> 14:26.800
Don't say a word.

14:26.800 --> 14:27.840
Thank you very much, John.

14:27.840 --> 14:29.200
He was very expensive.

14:29.200 --> 14:30.880
His time is very expensive.

14:31.760 --> 14:32.640
Do you guys want a yahoo?

14:33.680 --> 14:34.160
Please.

14:35.520 --> 14:37.920
Here's a yahoo that was sent in by Matt Estavez.

14:37.920 --> 14:38.960
Thank you, Matt.

14:38.960 --> 14:44.800
It's by yahoo answers user Yoville posted in arts and humanities history.

14:46.480 --> 14:50.960
Yoville asks, what are the ranks in the Illuminati?

14:52.400 --> 14:54.080
Name all of the ranks or anything.

14:55.520 --> 14:59.680
Name all of the ranks or anything they use to describe their self as.

15:02.080 --> 15:08.000
Well, there's the Bluebirds and the Cardinals and the Bluebirds are the more advanced Illuminati

15:08.000 --> 15:10.320
and the Cardinals are the ones that need some help.

15:11.840 --> 15:13.600
Is that some red wall shit?

15:14.320 --> 15:17.280
No, it's like a that's like elementary school stuff.

15:18.640 --> 15:19.280
I don't have that.

15:20.080 --> 15:23.760
I think that if anyone answers this question, then they're not Illuminati.

15:24.320 --> 15:28.720
Because they would know better than yeah, because they would know better than to reveal

15:28.720 --> 15:29.360
the secrets.

15:30.320 --> 15:33.200
Let me bounce something that yahoo answers user armor.

15:33.200 --> 15:39.440
We responded with very helpful stuff from our own.

15:40.400 --> 15:43.520
They said the leader of the Earth's Illuminati.

15:43.520 --> 15:46.560
So that's a pretty fucking crazy six words right there.

15:48.160 --> 15:51.440
The leader of the Earth's Illuminati is called the Pindar.

15:52.560 --> 15:53.040
Cool.

15:53.040 --> 15:58.320
The Pindar is a member of one of the 13 ruling Illuminati families and is always male.

15:58.320 --> 15:59.280
That's kind of fucked up.

16:00.480 --> 16:02.160
It's 2014.

16:02.160 --> 16:06.000
But really, there's probably a good reason for that in this next sentence.

16:06.000 --> 16:11.280
The title Pindar is an abbreviated term for pinnacle of the Draco,

16:11.280 --> 16:13.760
also known as the Penis of the Dragon.

16:14.960 --> 16:16.560
I was so hoping that's what it would be.

16:17.280 --> 16:21.360
The Penis of the Dragon is probably my favorite Stephen King book.

16:21.360 --> 16:24.480
He doesn't get a lot of credit, but I'm deeply into it.

16:25.040 --> 16:26.320
All hail me.

16:26.320 --> 16:27.840
The Penis of the Dragon.

16:27.840 --> 16:29.280
Why are you giggling?

16:29.280 --> 16:30.480
Why are you all giggling?

16:30.480 --> 16:32.000
You're the worst Illuminati.

16:32.000 --> 16:32.560
Scott.

16:34.800 --> 16:35.920
Scott Illuminati.

16:36.720 --> 16:40.560
Scott Illuminati, I hear you giggling underneath your innate mask.

16:41.440 --> 16:44.240
It must be so frustrating to be a member of the Illuminati

16:44.240 --> 16:46.880
as everybody is like just spreading out this shit.

16:46.880 --> 16:48.640
And you want to say like, hey, that's not true.

16:48.640 --> 16:49.920
Hey, that's not how it's worked.

16:49.920 --> 16:51.280
It's Gooch of the Dragon.

16:51.280 --> 16:53.360
God, I'm the Goochess.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.480
I am the Goochess of Earth's Illuminati.

16:56.480 --> 17:00.960
Wouldn't it be hard to be the Penis of the Dragon

17:00.960 --> 17:04.640
and then somebody cuts in line in front of you at the Chinese buffet

17:04.640 --> 17:07.600
and you're like, because they want the last of the coconut shrimp

17:07.600 --> 17:10.240
and you're like, hey, you better not do that.

17:10.240 --> 17:11.360
And they look at you, why?

17:11.360 --> 17:13.600
And you just have to stare at the floor.

17:13.600 --> 17:14.880
It's like, oh, I can't try.

17:14.880 --> 17:15.440
Never mind.

17:15.440 --> 17:17.600
But you better not do it.

17:17.600 --> 17:18.640
I'm the Penis of-

17:21.040 --> 17:23.200
I'm the Enos Pei of the Agandre.

17:23.200 --> 17:25.040
Enos Pei.

17:25.040 --> 17:27.440
You just make a triangle with your fingers.

17:27.440 --> 17:28.000
Get it?

17:28.000 --> 17:28.720
Get it.

17:28.720 --> 17:31.680
And then you put that triangle close to your crotch

17:31.680 --> 17:33.440
to make it look like a penis tip

17:33.440 --> 17:35.280
and then you flap your wings like a dragon.

17:36.720 --> 17:37.280
Get it?

17:37.280 --> 17:38.720
The shrimp is yours.

17:38.720 --> 17:39.680
You win.

17:39.680 --> 17:40.240
I'm leaving.

17:42.000 --> 17:45.280
There do have to be like certain levels of Illuminati.

17:45.280 --> 17:48.000
You can't just start as like full-fledged

17:48.000 --> 17:50.160
like on the council Illuminati.

17:50.160 --> 17:52.240
You've got to start as like junior Illuminati, right?

17:52.240 --> 17:52.960
Right?

17:52.960 --> 17:54.080
I think there's a sure-fire-

17:54.960 --> 17:57.200
I don't know how anybody finds out about it,

17:57.200 --> 18:00.160
but I've seen the Yahoos that Drew Davenport sent in.

18:00.160 --> 18:03.040
If that cat has not found how to get into the Illuminati yet,

18:03.040 --> 18:04.880
I don't think anybody ever will.

18:04.880 --> 18:07.280
It seems like he probably would have unearthed it by now.

18:08.480 --> 18:10.080
Well, but how would we know?

18:10.080 --> 18:11.280
Are you suggesting, Travis,

18:11.280 --> 18:14.480
that maybe there's like an Illuminati Awanas program?

18:15.600 --> 18:18.160
Illuminati brownies or something?

18:18.160 --> 18:20.640
Yeah, like you're a Cub Scout Illuminati.

18:20.640 --> 18:23.040
You start, you're making Pinewood Derby first,

18:23.040 --> 18:25.600
and then like 10 years later, you're ruling the world.

18:25.600 --> 18:27.920
You're controlling all the bank cartels and shit.

18:29.040 --> 18:29.760
How do they know?

18:29.760 --> 18:32.000
They're not just gonna like first day Illuminati

18:32.000 --> 18:34.160
hand you the reins to the American government.

18:35.120 --> 18:38.800
They won't even admit that you're in it first.

18:38.800 --> 18:39.840
You gotta be really careful.

18:39.840 --> 18:41.360
They won't admit the Illuminati exists

18:41.360 --> 18:42.800
until you're a couple ranks in.

18:42.800 --> 18:44.480
Sometimes it's just people trying to trick you

18:44.480 --> 18:45.280
out of your rent money.

18:45.280 --> 18:47.280
So wait, am I in the Illuminati or not?

18:47.280 --> 18:48.000
Well, I guess that's up to you.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.840
Are you the real Illuminati?

18:49.840 --> 18:51.040
Six months in, it's like,

18:51.040 --> 18:54.000
hey, you didn't show up to our bowling game on Tuesday.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.600
Oh, so it is a bowling league.

18:55.600 --> 18:57.600
Fuck, I guess wrong again, shit.

18:58.240 --> 19:00.160
Do you think when you start off in the Illuminati,

19:00.160 --> 19:02.160
they let you like control a student government

19:02.880 --> 19:04.800
and like just see how you do with that first?

19:06.640 --> 19:09.920
The first thing you control is a fantasy football league.

19:09.920 --> 19:11.840
That's where you start in the Illuminati.

19:11.840 --> 19:13.920
But no one can know about it.

19:13.920 --> 19:15.360
My name's Scott Jenkins

19:15.360 --> 19:17.280
and I'm running for Huntington High School's

19:17.280 --> 19:21.280
Tip of the Dragon Penis.

19:21.280 --> 19:23.200
Just a tip please, vote Scott.

19:25.920 --> 19:29.120
I'm gonna sort down the lunch signs on Taco Tuesday.

19:29.120 --> 19:31.040
Vote for me for Dragon Penis.

19:39.040 --> 19:40.640
I seen you run in the halls.

19:40.640 --> 19:42.400
I have cameras everywhere.

19:44.080 --> 19:44.800
Scott.

19:44.800 --> 19:48.480
Scott, the principal comes to him in a robe.

19:48.480 --> 19:49.360
Tell me what to do.

19:52.560 --> 19:53.680
Milkshake machine.

19:54.800 --> 19:55.760
Next question.

19:55.760 --> 19:56.720
My name is Simon.

19:57.440 --> 19:58.240
I'm from England.

19:58.800 --> 19:59.760
You didn't need this.

19:59.760 --> 20:02.160
We knew you were from England based on the name.

20:02.160 --> 20:02.800
Is that fair?

20:04.000 --> 20:06.160
Maybe based on the accent, hold on.

20:06.160 --> 20:07.360
Nope, nope, nope, nope.

20:07.360 --> 20:08.000
I can't.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.920
My name is Simon.

20:09.920 --> 20:11.040
I'm from England.

20:11.040 --> 20:11.760
Okay.

20:11.760 --> 20:16.080
I'm finishing up my final year in a PhD program in the US,

20:16.080 --> 20:17.760
specifically Missouri.

20:17.760 --> 20:18.640
Now switch to a Missouri accent.

20:18.640 --> 20:22.640
During my five years here, I've found the stories about Americans

20:23.360 --> 20:25.840
loving the English accent to be true.

20:26.800 --> 20:28.720
It is nice to be appreciated,

20:28.720 --> 20:32.160
but it also sometimes jarring, even annoying,

20:32.160 --> 20:34.640
when I'm simply getting a coffee and I say, thank you.

20:35.280 --> 20:39.840
Or only to hear, oh my God, I love your accent.

20:39.840 --> 20:42.720
I've even tried to put on a Missouri accent.

20:42.720 --> 20:44.480
That's what I was doing earlier, you see,

20:44.480 --> 20:46.640
at the checkout to avoid this problem.

20:46.640 --> 20:49.760
And Simon, I am sure it is convincing.

20:50.640 --> 20:52.880
My question is two pronged.

20:52.880 --> 20:53.920
You call them prongs.

20:53.920 --> 20:56.320
That's like, that's problem number one.

20:57.600 --> 20:59.600
My question is two pronged.

21:00.160 --> 21:02.640
Why do Americans love the English accent?

21:03.520 --> 21:06.400
Two, what can I do to be honest about my feelings

21:06.400 --> 21:08.800
that it's just a voice and I didn't work for it

21:08.800 --> 21:10.640
so it doesn't deserve praise?

21:10.640 --> 21:12.000
And that's from Simon.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.200
Oh, poor baby.

21:13.200 --> 21:14.240
Well, for number one.

21:15.600 --> 21:17.360
Oh, I can't imagine.

21:17.360 --> 21:20.000
All the, everybody, all the ladies and all the guys

21:20.000 --> 21:20.960
are throwing themselves at me

21:20.960 --> 21:22.640
because I sound like Benedict Cumberbatch.

21:22.640 --> 21:24.240
It's so hard, Justin.

21:24.240 --> 21:26.400
Please, brothers, please, brothers,

21:26.400 --> 21:28.480
who sound like extras from Dukes of Hazzard.

21:29.120 --> 21:33.040
Please tell me how to navigate this terrible life situation

21:33.040 --> 21:34.160
I find myself in.

21:34.800 --> 21:36.320
Crikey, shrimp on the bar.

21:36.320 --> 21:36.820
Nope.

21:36.820 --> 21:37.680
Wrong.

21:37.680 --> 21:38.480
Did it bad.

21:38.480 --> 21:40.080
I'm so sorry, Simon.

21:40.080 --> 21:41.120
As far as number one goes,

21:41.120 --> 21:43.440
I always imagine that people really like the accent

21:43.440 --> 21:48.000
because like as melting pot as we're supposed to be,

21:48.000 --> 21:49.040
it's pretty homogenous.

21:49.040 --> 21:50.960
Like everybody pretty much sounds the same

21:51.680 --> 21:52.880
from coast to coast.

21:52.880 --> 21:53.280
And so-

21:53.280 --> 21:55.280
That's 100% not true.

21:55.280 --> 21:55.840
It is.

21:55.840 --> 21:56.640
What are you talking about?

21:56.640 --> 22:00.480
No, I just mean as far as like, if you go to like-

22:00.480 --> 22:04.240
Travis, you've got to, like, you can't just say words.

22:04.240 --> 22:05.040
They have meaning.

22:05.040 --> 22:05.600
Well, hear me out.

22:05.600 --> 22:09.120
What I mean is if you go to like Scotland

22:09.120 --> 22:11.040
or go to England or go to Ireland,

22:11.040 --> 22:12.960
like any other European country,

22:12.960 --> 22:15.760
like there are people coming through there all the time

22:15.760 --> 22:18.000
and you hear different accents constantly

22:18.000 --> 22:21.280
to the point where it kind of loses its effect.

22:21.280 --> 22:23.040
Whereas here, to hear someone with-

22:23.040 --> 22:25.760
You are making this shit up from whole cloth.

22:25.760 --> 22:26.640
I mean, pretty much.

22:27.680 --> 22:29.600
Okay, all right.

22:29.600 --> 22:30.880
He finally admits it.

22:30.880 --> 22:33.280
It only took us 229 episodes.

22:33.280 --> 22:35.600
But wouldn't you admit that it's more unique here

22:35.600 --> 22:39.360
to hear an out of the country accent

22:39.360 --> 22:40.960
than it would be in other countries?

22:40.960 --> 22:42.080
Than an American accent?

22:42.080 --> 22:42.800
Yeah, Trav.

22:44.480 --> 22:47.200
That's just how time and space function.

22:47.200 --> 22:49.760
No, I mean, as compared to other countries,

22:49.760 --> 22:51.200
I imagine that that is the case.

22:51.200 --> 22:54.080
I am basing that off of nothing but my own supposition.

22:54.800 --> 22:55.040
Okay.

22:56.320 --> 22:56.960
I mean, other countries-

22:56.960 --> 22:58.960
But your supposition has to be based on something

22:58.960 --> 23:00.160
or else you're just making it up.

23:00.160 --> 23:01.600
As opposed to the rest of this show,

23:01.600 --> 23:03.760
which is all based on research and facts.

23:03.760 --> 23:04.160
No, no, no.

23:05.840 --> 23:07.120
Here's what you should have argued.

23:07.120 --> 23:08.160
Thank you, Griffin.

23:08.160 --> 23:09.280
If you were better at this.

23:09.280 --> 23:10.560
An English person comes here

23:10.560 --> 23:13.520
and drops some dope knowledge with their English accent

23:13.520 --> 23:16.320
and everybody gets wet.

23:16.320 --> 23:19.440
And we go to England and everyone dries up,

23:19.440 --> 23:24.640
dries it right up like an old crusty flume.

23:24.640 --> 23:26.800
I literally couldn't have put it better myself.

23:27.360 --> 23:29.920
Yeah, especially the crusty flume shit.

23:29.920 --> 23:32.320
Yeah, you are incapable of painting

23:32.320 --> 23:33.360
those kinds of word pictures.

23:34.400 --> 23:35.280
No, you're right.

23:35.280 --> 23:37.280
But how is it a problem?

23:37.280 --> 23:39.200
I guess it is a problem if you live with it.

23:39.200 --> 23:41.920
And it's like, I just want to go to the Piggly Wiggly.

23:41.920 --> 23:43.040
Is that what they have in Missouri?

23:45.040 --> 23:46.080
Yeah, that sounds about right.

23:47.440 --> 23:49.360
Anything that's not HEB, I just don't.

23:49.360 --> 23:50.560
I can't comprehend it.

23:51.680 --> 23:55.680
And you just want to get some, I guess,

23:55.680 --> 23:57.440
breakfast teas or something.

23:57.440 --> 23:59.920
I guess I just don't see why,

24:00.800 --> 24:04.160
in what reality would it make more sense to,

24:04.160 --> 24:06.000
like, why would you ever want to like,

24:06.000 --> 24:07.440
rather than just say, oh, thanks,

24:08.080 --> 24:10.800
or, oh, blind me, gov, no, thank you.

24:11.680 --> 24:12.960
Rather than say that,

24:12.960 --> 24:14.320
why would you want to get into like,

24:15.360 --> 24:16.960
it's a pleasantry, man.

24:16.960 --> 24:17.760
It's a pleasantry.

24:17.760 --> 24:20.560
Okay, you're talking a lot of heat right now.

24:20.560 --> 24:22.480
You're really pulling a Travis

24:22.480 --> 24:24.880
because I want you to imagine being at the grocery store

24:24.880 --> 24:26.160
and having to talk to someone.

24:26.160 --> 24:28.320
Okay, I'm imagining it.

24:29.680 --> 24:30.720
It's not great, is it?

24:31.440 --> 24:33.600
No, but like, he, what I'm saying is,

24:33.600 --> 24:38.080
why is he wanting to invite a deeper conversation about this?

24:38.720 --> 24:41.760
Like, he's not, he's asking how to completely avoid it.

24:42.400 --> 24:43.840
No, no, he's not.

24:43.840 --> 24:46.640
Saying, what can I do to be honest about my feelings?

24:47.200 --> 24:48.320
That's not, he's not gonna wear a t-shirt that says-

24:48.320 --> 24:49.760
First of all, welcome to America.

24:49.760 --> 24:50.800
We don't do that here.

24:51.440 --> 24:52.560
We don't do that here.

24:53.120 --> 24:55.120
What, you, I mean, he's not talking about

24:55.120 --> 24:56.160
wearing t-shirts that says,

24:57.280 --> 25:00.080
just here for the crumpets, but please leave me alone.

25:00.080 --> 25:02.640
He's talking about like, how can he engage with people

25:02.640 --> 25:06.720
to make them more sensitive about his inability

25:06.720 --> 25:08.480
to accept compliments about his accent?

25:09.280 --> 25:10.320
You know, people get compliments

25:10.320 --> 25:11.680
for a lot of things they didn't work for.

25:12.320 --> 25:14.640
I get compliments, Travis gets compliments on his hair.

25:14.640 --> 25:15.140
Correct.

25:16.240 --> 25:19.600
I get compliments on my, my God-given muscles

25:19.600 --> 25:21.440
and I, I didn't work for him.

25:21.440 --> 25:23.520
It just, I'm sculpted that way, carved out of wood.

25:23.520 --> 25:24.400
It's amazing.

25:24.400 --> 25:25.680
What do I, and what do I have?

25:25.680 --> 25:26.400
What do I have?

25:26.400 --> 25:26.640
What?

25:26.640 --> 25:27.040
You're beautiful.

25:27.040 --> 25:27.520
What do I have?

25:27.520 --> 25:30.240
Your beautiful teeth that you consume human beings with.

25:30.240 --> 25:34.000
Besides from the most successful VOR podcast on the dark web.

25:35.840 --> 25:37.200
It's just not that, I just don't-

25:37.200 --> 25:38.560
I agree with Justin on this one.

25:38.560 --> 25:41.840
I think that it's, it's, it just like someone saying,

25:41.840 --> 25:43.600
nice weather isn't an invitation

25:43.600 --> 25:45.440
to like actually discuss the weather.

25:45.440 --> 25:48.480
I think that this is just like, great accent, thank you.

25:48.480 --> 25:49.840
I didn't make the weather.

25:49.840 --> 25:51.680
I had nothing to do with the weather, okay?

25:51.680 --> 25:53.840
It's just how it is.

25:53.840 --> 25:56.000
Maybe I like the clouds.

25:56.000 --> 25:57.200
You ever think about that?

25:57.200 --> 25:58.000
You ever think about that?

25:58.640 --> 25:59.200
Shit weather.

26:01.200 --> 26:03.440
Yeah, that's actually a good point, Travis.

26:03.440 --> 26:05.680
It's not as crazy as a comparison as it may seem.

26:05.680 --> 26:07.920
I mean, you didn't do anything to invite this.

26:07.920 --> 26:09.760
They're just like making conversation

26:09.760 --> 26:10.880
and trying to say something nice.

26:10.880 --> 26:13.520
It doesn't require you to, to get up in arms about it.

26:13.520 --> 26:14.560
Just accept the compliment.

26:14.560 --> 26:15.920
Oh, thank you, Governor.

26:15.920 --> 26:16.640
I appreciate it.

26:16.640 --> 26:19.840
Think of it as like, if you wear like a, a great watch

26:19.840 --> 26:22.480
or a great top and they're just looking for an opportunity

26:22.480 --> 26:24.400
to compliment something about you,

26:24.400 --> 26:27.280
to try to like make you feel nice about your day, you know?

26:27.280 --> 26:28.800
And it's like the same as saying like,

26:28.800 --> 26:30.160
oh, I love your shoes.

26:30.160 --> 26:31.440
I love your accent.

26:31.440 --> 26:32.560
You know, it's that idea of like,

26:32.560 --> 26:35.440
they're just saying something nice to be pleasant.

26:35.440 --> 26:37.120
So if you don't want them to say anything

26:37.120 --> 26:38.640
about your accent anymore, you need to get,

26:38.640 --> 26:40.800
and it's amazing how this is the solution

26:40.800 --> 26:42.880
to basically every problem we're pitched.

26:42.880 --> 26:46.800
Just big diesel muscles.

26:46.800 --> 26:48.000
Just huge, huge muscles.

26:48.000 --> 26:52.080
Justin, like Justin's God-given heft muscles.

26:53.440 --> 26:55.440
One way to get that conversation to stop,

26:55.440 --> 26:57.520
and I don't know how to spread the word that you do this,

26:57.520 --> 27:01.840
but just when somebody compliments you on your accent,

27:01.840 --> 27:04.000
just keep asking for more.

27:04.000 --> 27:05.200
Like, you're really needy.

27:05.200 --> 27:06.080
Like, oh, go on.

27:07.200 --> 27:08.240
What do you like about it best?

27:08.240 --> 27:09.600
What words do you want to hear me say?

27:10.240 --> 27:11.040
I'll say any words.

27:11.040 --> 27:12.640
I'll say all of the words.

27:13.360 --> 27:14.800
Do you want me to call your friend?

27:14.800 --> 27:15.280
Check this out.

27:15.280 --> 27:16.480
And leave a voicemail for him?

27:16.480 --> 27:16.880
Check this out.

27:16.880 --> 27:18.880
This is what it sounds like when I whisper.

27:18.880 --> 27:20.000
God save the queen.

27:20.000 --> 27:21.280
A-S-M-R.

27:21.280 --> 27:21.780
Govna.

27:22.560 --> 27:23.280
Govna, Govna.

27:23.280 --> 27:25.760
Govna J. Nixon of Missouri.

27:28.160 --> 27:28.880
Y'all want a Yahoo?

27:29.520 --> 27:30.400
Yeah, sure.

27:30.400 --> 27:31.120
Here's a Yahoo.

27:31.680 --> 27:33.120
Or should I say a Yajuru?

27:33.120 --> 27:34.240
Sent in by Drew Davenport.

27:34.240 --> 27:35.840
Thank you, Yajuru.

27:36.480 --> 27:39.840
It's by Yajuru Answers user Lardell who asks,

27:39.840 --> 27:41.040
yes or no?

27:41.040 --> 27:43.200
The things I'm into are interesting.

27:43.200 --> 27:48.560
So let's just shoot down the list real quick and you guys can weigh in and let me know how

27:48.560 --> 27:49.920
interesting Lardell stuff is.

27:51.120 --> 27:52.400
What are we into your game, Lardell?

27:52.400 --> 27:53.760
Okay, let's see.

27:53.760 --> 27:54.880
Underground hip-hop.

27:54.880 --> 27:57.920
I think we can unanimously put these up and cool.

27:57.920 --> 28:00.800
If you know how to find that, please let me know.

28:00.800 --> 28:03.840
I'm basically just trying to get like surface level hip-hop masters.

28:03.840 --> 28:04.240
Sure.

28:04.240 --> 28:06.480
Thick and sexy women, Lardell.

28:08.320 --> 28:09.280
You frascal.

28:10.560 --> 28:11.360
Faith Evans.

28:11.360 --> 28:15.520
You know what I say, the thicker the woman, the bigger the bite when I swallow her.

28:15.520 --> 28:16.320
Big gulp.

28:16.320 --> 28:17.760
Check out on Guy Toons.

28:17.760 --> 28:18.640
Every Flerzday.

28:20.080 --> 28:21.600
Wax Poetics.

28:21.600 --> 28:21.840
Sure.

28:24.320 --> 28:26.960
Is that where he's finding out about his underground hip-hop?

28:26.960 --> 28:27.520
Probably.

28:27.520 --> 28:28.400
Dusty Groove.

28:29.040 --> 28:31.440
Either an underground hip-hop artist or another magazine.

28:31.440 --> 28:32.480
Louisville Cardinals.

28:35.440 --> 28:36.240
Pittsburgh Steelers.

28:36.800 --> 28:38.000
Again, I don't think these are interesting.

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
Like billions of people like the Louisville Cardinals.

28:40.000 --> 28:41.360
Billions of people like the Steelers.

28:42.160 --> 28:43.280
Music is my drug.

28:43.280 --> 28:48.320
Well, that's just a saying that you sort of did about yourself.

28:49.200 --> 28:49.600
Right?

28:49.600 --> 28:50.800
Not so much an interest?

28:50.800 --> 28:52.640
Not so much a thing that you're interested in.

28:53.360 --> 28:53.920
Snickers.

28:55.680 --> 28:58.080
Is this this person's Facebook like collection?

28:58.880 --> 29:01.600
All I can imagine is that this is the scenario we're looking at.

29:02.640 --> 29:03.680
What was this person's name?

29:04.320 --> 29:04.800
Lardell.

29:04.800 --> 29:05.520
Lardell.

29:05.520 --> 29:09.200
Lardell has encountered several people that when he starts to talk about himself,

29:09.200 --> 29:10.000
they go,

29:10.560 --> 29:12.720
Lardell, you're not interesting.

29:12.720 --> 29:14.080
And he said, you are wrong.

29:14.080 --> 29:14.640
You're wrong.

29:14.640 --> 29:16.000
I'll get the internet to prove it.

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
Some of these things I think are genuinely interesting.

29:18.000 --> 29:19.120
Talk radio.

29:19.120 --> 29:20.640
The fact that you can actually listen to that.

29:20.640 --> 29:21.120
Yes.

29:21.920 --> 29:22.640
Congratulations.

29:22.640 --> 29:23.440
I'm interested.

29:24.160 --> 29:25.600
RIP Biggie Smalls.

29:25.600 --> 29:29.280
I'm interested that that's an interest.

29:29.280 --> 29:32.080
I'm interested about that interest of yours.

29:32.080 --> 29:33.440
I miss Michael Jackson.

29:33.440 --> 29:35.520
I fucking do too, Lardell.

29:35.520 --> 29:36.880
Now you've hooked me.

29:36.880 --> 29:37.680
Bernie Mac.

29:37.680 --> 29:38.320
Sure.

29:38.320 --> 29:42.960
Sure. I'm going to pull a chair beside you and we're going to talk about Bernie Mac for hours.

29:42.960 --> 29:43.520
Fuck yeah.

29:44.640 --> 29:45.200
Fuck yes.

29:46.000 --> 29:50.400
It's weird to me that Snickers rated above those things in his interests.

29:51.280 --> 29:52.800
I'm just sort of popping around here.

29:52.800 --> 29:53.920
I love to draw.

29:53.920 --> 29:56.000
Again, that's sort of just a sentence, isn't it?

29:56.000 --> 29:57.360
Should have just maybe said drawing.

29:58.400 --> 29:59.760
But fine.

29:59.760 --> 30:00.800
Chili cheese dogs.

30:01.520 --> 30:04.480
Lardell, you're hitting a valley, bud.

30:04.480 --> 30:08.320
We just came off of sweet Bernie Mac Peak and now we're in a valley together.

30:09.920 --> 30:11.520
Uncle Sam's Jams.

30:12.240 --> 30:13.840
Oh, you got me back, Lardell.

30:16.880 --> 30:19.360
You got me back.

30:22.240 --> 30:24.000
How are you guys feeling about Lardell right now?

30:24.000 --> 30:28.880
Let's take a quick Lardell break and just tell me how you feel about him as a person vis-a-vis his interests.

30:28.880 --> 30:34.640
I can just imagine this guy with his Faith Hill poster.

30:34.640 --> 30:35.200
Faith Evans.

30:35.200 --> 30:37.600
Listening to Faith Hill.

30:37.600 --> 30:40.480
Oh fuck, did I confuse Faith Evans and Faith Hill?

30:41.440 --> 30:41.840
Okay.

30:41.840 --> 30:42.960
Hold on, let me check this out.

30:43.600 --> 30:44.640
Oh yeah, different person.

30:45.360 --> 30:46.480
Totally different person.

30:47.520 --> 30:52.560
So he's got a picture of somebody on his wall.

30:52.560 --> 30:54.720
He's listening to his underground hip-hop eatin' Snickers.

30:54.720 --> 31:00.640
And just being interested in rest in peace Mickey Smalls.

31:00.640 --> 31:02.480
Just wondering how his situation is.

31:02.480 --> 31:05.680
Maybe somewhere in the distance, Mr. 3000.

31:05.680 --> 31:10.240
His old beaten up laser disk of Mr. 3000 is playing for the umpteenth time.

31:10.240 --> 31:11.760
He seems like a pretty cool dude.

31:13.520 --> 31:16.000
I would say that if Lardell leaned over to me and said like,

31:16.000 --> 31:18.400
hey, do you want to talk about how much we miss Michael Jackson?

31:18.960 --> 31:19.600
Yeah.

31:19.600 --> 31:20.880
A thousand percent do.

31:20.880 --> 31:22.960
If he said, do you like chili cheese dogs?

31:22.960 --> 31:24.000
Yeah, I do.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.320
And then we'd probably start talking about Sonic the Hedgehog.

31:26.320 --> 31:29.040
And then he'd be like, hey, I got an extra Snickers.

31:29.040 --> 31:29.760
Do you want one?

31:29.760 --> 31:31.600
And then we're like best friend city.

31:31.600 --> 31:31.920
Yeah.

31:31.920 --> 31:34.160
And he'd be like, hey, I need to repair a drum skin.

31:34.160 --> 31:36.560
Do you want to come with me to Uncle Sam's Jams?

31:36.560 --> 31:40.080
Which is a musical instrument retailer in Louisville, Kentucky.

31:40.640 --> 31:42.720
They're closing soon, according to Google.

31:42.720 --> 31:44.080
Six PM is the time they close.

31:44.080 --> 31:44.640
So make sure you-

31:44.640 --> 31:44.960
Oh, okay.

31:44.960 --> 31:46.160
So like closing for the day.

31:46.160 --> 31:49.040
Not like shutting down because Lardell is the only customer.

31:49.040 --> 31:50.960
Uncle Sam's Jams, that's an institution.

31:50.960 --> 31:53.200
Little disappointed it is not a jelly retailer.

31:53.200 --> 31:55.360
But you don't always get what you want.

31:56.560 --> 31:59.040
Knowing Louisville, it should be like a musical instrument

31:59.040 --> 32:00.640
and jam retailer.

32:00.640 --> 32:02.320
Here's my point.

32:03.840 --> 32:08.560
I now know more about Lardell than I do about either of you.

32:08.560 --> 32:09.360
Fair enough.

32:09.360 --> 32:11.360
I keep it pretty close to the vest.

32:14.480 --> 32:16.960
Maybe it's just that the shit that he is into

32:16.960 --> 32:18.320
is so much more interesting than the shit

32:18.320 --> 32:20.240
that I know that you guys are into.

32:20.240 --> 32:22.080
And Lardell, I got to tell you, buddy,

32:22.080 --> 32:24.880
I think you only need like two or three things.

32:24.880 --> 32:26.160
Oh, maybe that's the problem.

32:26.160 --> 32:28.480
Maybe he's got so many things going

32:28.480 --> 32:30.640
that it makes everything else seem bland.

32:30.640 --> 32:31.440
Whittle it down.

32:31.440 --> 32:34.000
Pick three of the things.

32:34.000 --> 32:35.360
Underground hip hop, thick and sexy women,

32:35.360 --> 32:37.040
Faith Evans, wax products, dusty groove,

32:37.040 --> 32:38.400
Louisville Cardinals, Pittsburgh Steelers,

32:38.400 --> 32:42.000
music is my drug, Snickers, talk radio,

32:42.000 --> 32:43.920
I love to draw, chili cheese dogs.

32:43.920 --> 32:44.480
Oh, I'm sorry.

32:44.480 --> 32:45.360
There's no space in there.

32:45.360 --> 32:46.880
He loves to draw chili cheese dogs.

32:48.080 --> 32:50.720
I would say thick and sexy women, talk radio,

32:50.720 --> 32:53.920
and I love to draw because-

32:54.480 --> 32:56.160
But I mean, you left out Michael Jackson,

32:56.160 --> 32:58.000
you left out Bernie Mac, you left out R.E.P. Biggie Smalls.

32:58.000 --> 32:58.960
But hear me out.

32:58.960 --> 33:00.640
Just by adding a couple words,

33:00.640 --> 33:02.160
by adding a couple words,

33:02.160 --> 33:04.480
I like to draw thick and sexy women

33:04.480 --> 33:05.840
that are on talk radio.

33:06.480 --> 33:06.980
Okay.

33:07.600 --> 33:10.160
That's a conversation opener.

33:10.160 --> 33:12.960
I'm starting to worry that I'm not as multifaceted

33:12.960 --> 33:13.760
as I should be.

33:13.760 --> 33:14.880
I'm starting to think that maybe I need to-

33:14.880 --> 33:17.040
Certainly not as multifaceted as Lardell.

33:17.040 --> 33:18.720
I'm starting to think I need to maybe sit down

33:18.720 --> 33:20.800
and write down some of my favorite things.

33:20.800 --> 33:23.440
I bet if you were to pick out your interests,

33:23.440 --> 33:24.800
they would be as varied.

33:25.920 --> 33:26.960
No, I can't even-

33:26.960 --> 33:28.080
No, so you can't even pretend.

33:28.080 --> 33:29.840
The problem is I like a lot of stuff a little.

33:31.280 --> 33:33.280
You could combine like 20 of the things that I love

33:33.280 --> 33:36.400
to equal Lardell's love of R.E.P. Biggie Smalls.

33:37.040 --> 33:38.400
How do you know how deep this goes?

33:39.360 --> 33:41.520
Because he's only listed about 25 things.

33:42.560 --> 33:43.280
And this is it.

33:43.280 --> 33:44.000
This is it.

33:44.000 --> 33:44.560
This is it.

33:44.560 --> 33:47.280
Are you saying to me he has zero cultural awareness

33:47.280 --> 33:49.280
of if I were to be like, hey, what do you think

33:49.280 --> 33:51.600
of the Iron Man franchise?

33:51.600 --> 33:52.160
I have no-

33:52.160 --> 33:52.800
I have no idea.

33:52.800 --> 33:54.000
You know, from Marvel Comics.

33:54.000 --> 33:55.680
I still don't.

33:56.640 --> 33:57.600
That's kind of weird.

33:57.600 --> 33:58.480
Do you watch any TV?

34:00.160 --> 34:02.320
Is that the thing Bill Maher's on?

34:02.320 --> 34:04.320
Because I know him.

34:04.320 --> 34:05.280
He's one of my interests.

34:05.840 --> 34:07.360
Have you seen any good movies lately?

34:07.360 --> 34:10.160
Not since Bernie Mac died, unfortunately, no.

34:13.360 --> 34:15.920
Hey, it looks like you might have scurvy.

34:15.920 --> 34:17.440
Yeah, it's just all the chili cheese dogs

34:17.440 --> 34:18.640
and Pepsi and Snickers.

34:18.640 --> 34:19.360
I think my-

34:20.080 --> 34:21.840
Are there vitamins in Snickers?

34:21.840 --> 34:23.120
A little bit, I guess.

34:23.120 --> 34:23.760
Maybe some.

34:24.480 --> 34:25.520
Maybe fortified.

34:25.520 --> 34:27.680
Do you want to maybe go out and have a salad?

34:27.680 --> 34:28.720
I'd sal-loud.

34:29.920 --> 34:31.360
Say that word again one more time.

34:31.360 --> 34:32.160
Salad.

34:32.160 --> 34:32.720
Salad.

34:33.440 --> 34:33.940
Did I-

34:34.640 --> 34:35.140
Salad.

34:35.920 --> 34:36.480
I can't-

34:36.480 --> 34:38.240
Doesn't seem to take.

34:39.280 --> 34:40.320
Speaking of green.

34:40.320 --> 34:55.520
L-A-R-D-E-L-L.

34:55.520 --> 34:55.760
Yeah.

34:55.760 --> 34:57.520
Because I am trying to find him on Facebook.

34:58.160 --> 34:58.400
Okay.

35:00.000 --> 35:00.480
Pass him around.

35:00.480 --> 35:01.280
Is that why you were so quiet?

35:01.280 --> 35:01.840
Yeah, I was.

35:01.840 --> 35:03.920
I was Facebooking Lardell.

35:04.880 --> 35:05.600
That makes sense.

35:05.600 --> 35:06.000
Great.

35:06.000 --> 35:06.800
The hunt is on.

35:07.360 --> 35:08.560
Everyone, don't hunt Lardell.

35:08.560 --> 35:11.760
Hey, you've probably tried Hulu on your computer.

35:12.480 --> 35:15.040
Just type in a web address and you are there.

35:15.680 --> 35:16.320
But-

35:16.320 --> 35:19.280
Well, the specific Hulu web address don't-

35:19.920 --> 35:20.640
It's not gonna-

35:20.640 --> 35:20.880
Yeah.

35:22.000 --> 35:23.600
Hulu Plus is like that, but better.

35:24.160 --> 35:27.440
Hulu Plus is Hulu evolved.

35:27.440 --> 35:30.560
It's the next levolution of Hulu.

35:30.560 --> 35:32.160
It's got all currencies and episodes.

35:32.160 --> 35:36.720
Your favorite shows like Modern Family and The Daily Show with Jonathan Stewart.

35:36.720 --> 35:42.080
And they've got every episode of South Park, which is a Hulu Plus exclusive.

35:42.800 --> 35:47.120
Is it gonna work on my Smart TVs or my Rokus or my Apples?

35:47.120 --> 35:47.360
No.

35:48.240 --> 35:49.200
Just kidding.

35:49.200 --> 35:50.000
Yes.

35:50.000 --> 35:51.040
Good goof.

35:51.040 --> 35:51.680
Got me again.

35:52.400 --> 35:56.320
Another great joke from my brother, my brother, and me family.

35:56.320 --> 36:04.080
Yeah, Smart TVs, Rokus, Apple TVs, Xbox, PS4, PS3, PS2, PS1, PS5, whatever you got.

36:04.080 --> 36:06.080
Gaipod first generation.

36:06.080 --> 36:06.960
You got a Talkboy.

36:07.520 --> 36:08.640
Load up Hulu on it.

36:09.920 --> 36:12.720
That you fill the wet bandits into thinking that you're having a party.

36:14.240 --> 36:18.880
You can even watch on your phone or your tablet or your train or your-

36:18.880 --> 36:19.440
Sorry.

36:19.440 --> 36:20.480
I mean, you're on the train.

36:20.480 --> 36:21.680
You can't watch it on a train.

36:22.400 --> 36:23.520
They won't project it on a train.

36:23.520 --> 36:25.280
No, you have to run beside it the whole time.

36:25.920 --> 36:28.560
Did you see this new episode of The Awesome?

36:29.520 --> 36:30.880
And that's the train hitting you.

36:30.880 --> 36:31.440
Because you-

36:31.440 --> 36:32.560
Watch The Awesomes, Griffin.

36:32.560 --> 36:34.240
Oh, that's an original TV show.

36:34.240 --> 36:36.640
It was created by Seth Meyers and Mike Shoemaker.

36:36.640 --> 36:39.760
It's an animated comedy series about a misfit group of superheroes.

36:39.760 --> 36:43.680
You should also check out Hot Wives of Orlando, which is a parody of Real Housewives,

36:43.680 --> 36:48.480
which stars Casey Wilson and Kristen Schaal, which they're just awesome anyways.

36:48.480 --> 36:52.240
Can I make a quick recommendation, a quick for real Hulu recommendation?

36:52.240 --> 36:55.600
And this is selfish because I don't want this show to go anywhere.

36:55.600 --> 36:59.600
There's a show called Marry Me with Casey Wilson and-

36:59.600 --> 37:00.640
Ken Marino.

37:00.640 --> 37:01.440
Ken Marino.

37:01.440 --> 37:03.040
It's so goddamn good.

37:03.040 --> 37:05.760
It's the best new show on television and you should absolutely be watching it.

37:05.760 --> 37:07.200
Oh my God, oh my God.

37:07.920 --> 37:10.800
Can we get Ken Marino as a guestpert?

37:10.800 --> 37:11.040
I don't see why not.

37:11.040 --> 37:12.080
Is that even possible?

37:12.080 --> 37:13.280
I want that so badly.

37:13.920 --> 37:15.280
God, Travis, get Ken Marino.

37:15.280 --> 37:16.720
You're in La La Land.

37:16.720 --> 37:17.520
Go find me a Ken Marino.

37:17.520 --> 37:19.680
He lives next door to me, so I'll just go talk to him.

37:20.240 --> 37:21.680
Go find me a Ken Marino.

37:22.320 --> 37:25.440
I tagged him so we could follow him all over the city.

37:25.440 --> 37:29.200
All the episodes of that amazing show are all on Hulu Plus and we can hook you up

37:29.200 --> 37:32.640
with a two week free trial if you go to HuluPlus.com slash my brother.

37:32.640 --> 37:33.520
All one word.

37:33.520 --> 37:38.880
That's a whole extra week on top of the usual bonus freebie that they give you.

37:38.880 --> 37:40.480
Go to HuluPlus.com slash my brother.

37:40.480 --> 37:42.400
All one word, two week free trial, free TV.

37:42.400 --> 37:42.880
Go get it.

37:43.520 --> 37:47.520
This week, My Brother, My Brother and Me is also supported by Harries.com,

37:47.520 --> 37:48.560
which we've talked about before.

37:48.560 --> 37:51.680
So by this point, you should know they revolutionize shaving.

37:51.680 --> 37:55.920
They ship shit right to your door so that you don't have to go to the drugstore anymore

37:55.920 --> 37:59.920
and have someone unlock that stupid case and stare at you like you're trying to steal razors

37:59.920 --> 38:02.640
and they just ship it to your door and it's way easier.

38:02.640 --> 38:05.280
The company makes amazing Germany engineered blades.

38:06.080 --> 38:07.920
Justin, you use them, correct?

38:07.920 --> 38:08.640
And you're a big fan.

38:09.600 --> 38:10.080
I do.

38:10.080 --> 38:17.760
They actually got me off of, I was using single blade razors and, you know, safety razors.

38:17.760 --> 38:18.960
And they got me off of it.

38:18.960 --> 38:22.080
Because you're an artisanal bartender living in Portland.

38:22.080 --> 38:22.580
Got them.

38:23.520 --> 38:27.600
For just $15, you get a set that includes a handle, three blades and shaving cream.

38:27.600 --> 38:31.440
That's an amazing value if you think about how much you would spend at the store getting that stuff.

38:31.440 --> 38:33.120
$862.

38:33.120 --> 38:33.600
Correct.

38:34.320 --> 38:36.800
The blades are half the price of their competitors.

38:36.800 --> 38:40.720
And they even offer custom engraving if you want to get your initials engraved in the razor,

38:40.720 --> 38:43.120
which is just super high class and really fancy.

38:44.560 --> 38:48.400
So go to harries.com and use the promo code mybrother, all one word,

38:48.400 --> 38:53.520
and Harries will give you $5 off your first purchase for all of our dear sweet listeners.

38:53.520 --> 38:55.120
So you could get that whole set for $10.

38:56.000 --> 38:56.560
Fuck it.

38:56.560 --> 38:58.080
Do it.

38:58.080 --> 38:58.560
Shave it.

38:59.280 --> 39:00.000
Smooth it.

39:00.000 --> 39:00.880
Smooth it out.

39:00.880 --> 39:03.840
I got a message for Mirza Gulchuk.

39:04.720 --> 39:06.640
I fucking crushed it.

39:06.640 --> 39:08.560
I crushed the pronunciation of that name.

39:08.560 --> 39:09.520
I destroyed it.

39:09.520 --> 39:13.520
They did provide a phonetic spelling of it, but I still did a really good job.

39:13.520 --> 39:16.240
And I waded through those choppy waters really well.

39:16.240 --> 39:18.000
The message is from Jameson and I want to say-

39:18.000 --> 39:20.880
Can I get a one like message of congratulations from the two of you?

39:20.880 --> 39:21.600
Yeah, you did great.

39:21.600 --> 39:24.800
I want to say thanks to Jameson for putting the pronunciation.

39:24.800 --> 39:25.760
Very helpful.

39:25.760 --> 39:26.960
Thank you.

39:26.960 --> 39:30.080
This message for Mirza Gulchuk.

39:32.640 --> 39:33.200
From Jameson.

39:33.200 --> 39:35.920
Jameson says, you are now married.

39:35.920 --> 39:37.520
Good job to you and Sarah.

39:37.520 --> 39:38.960
And me, of course.

39:38.960 --> 39:42.720
Now old Unky J is just waiting for you to pick out some baby names.

39:42.720 --> 39:43.680
Here's a hint.

39:43.680 --> 39:45.120
Just flip the open-

39:45.120 --> 39:46.960
Just flip the open-

39:46.960 --> 39:48.240
Guessing missed a word there.

39:48.240 --> 39:49.280
That's okay, Jameson.

39:50.080 --> 39:53.440
Just flip the book open to J and look after James.

39:53.440 --> 39:57.200
My name is suitable for all kinds of kids, but especially smart ones.

39:57.200 --> 39:58.800
Seriously, I will open a trust fund.

39:59.440 --> 39:59.920
There it is.

39:59.920 --> 40:00.720
Now you got to do it.

40:00.720 --> 40:03.040
Now you gots to do it, Mirza Gulchuk.

40:03.040 --> 40:06.160
I hope Mirza and Sarah are actually planning on having a kid.

40:06.160 --> 40:07.760
Otherwise, Jameson just like-

40:07.760 --> 40:10.080
Jameson really, really jumped the gun.

40:10.720 --> 40:11.680
Put a baby in that.

40:13.600 --> 40:14.800
I have to kill my cat.

40:14.800 --> 40:15.280
One sec.

40:15.280 --> 40:15.520
Okay.

40:17.520 --> 40:18.240
This is it.

40:18.240 --> 40:21.760
And this next message is very special for a very special man

40:21.760 --> 40:25.280
who's near and dear to all of us, Drew Davenport.

40:25.280 --> 40:28.720
And it's from, I think it's the hacker group Anonymous.

40:29.600 --> 40:30.080
Oh, great.

40:30.080 --> 40:32.480
Or it might just be someone not giving their name.

40:32.480 --> 40:33.440
It's one of those two things.

40:33.440 --> 40:34.080
Let's go with that.

40:34.080 --> 40:36.240
The message is, yo, Drew, we got your penis.

40:37.760 --> 40:40.160
Yo, Drew, we got all your penis JPEGs.

40:40.960 --> 40:42.400
That'll be five Bitcoins.

40:43.600 --> 40:45.360
I learned that you're an awesome person.

40:45.360 --> 40:48.800
And a great friend, I love hearing y'all Drew's and seeing the LED live show

40:48.800 --> 40:50.000
with you was amazing.

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
I never knew what to get you for your birthday.

40:52.000 --> 40:54.160
Nor do I actually know when your birthday is.

40:54.160 --> 40:56.560
So I thought a message from the brothers would be appropriate.

40:56.560 --> 40:58.640
Happy birthday, Drew, whenever it happens to be.

41:00.000 --> 41:03.200
Maybe this is probably somebody Drew actually knows.

41:03.200 --> 41:07.280
If not, I mean, if it, regardless, it's going to drive Drew mad.

41:07.280 --> 41:10.720
Him trying to figure it, trying to suss out, trying to ferret this mystery out.

41:10.720 --> 41:11.440
Crack the case.

41:11.440 --> 41:12.720
Somebody gaslighted him.

41:12.720 --> 41:15.520
Probably, he's worth it, I think.

41:16.080 --> 41:16.640
Oh, definitely.

41:16.640 --> 41:19.920
He's definitely worth driving insane slowly over time.

41:19.920 --> 41:21.680
Oh, I'd gaslight his brains out.

41:21.680 --> 41:22.240
Oh yeah.

41:22.240 --> 41:23.040
He's a great guy.

41:23.040 --> 41:23.920
I would gaslight him.

41:23.920 --> 41:24.960
I don't want to gaslight Drew.

41:25.680 --> 41:26.240
Coward.

41:26.240 --> 41:27.520
I already started for all of us.

41:27.520 --> 41:32.080
So welcome to the lady to lady show behind door.

41:32.080 --> 41:36.480
Number one, we have fantastic weekly guests like Aisha Tyler, French Stewart,

41:36.480 --> 41:38.640
Greta and more behind door.

41:38.640 --> 41:41.280
Number two, we have a special guest.

41:41.280 --> 41:45.840
Behind door number two, we have road trip and sleepover games like Would You Rather

41:45.840 --> 41:49.760
and Never Have I Ever, the kind of games that remind you of being a kid.

41:49.760 --> 41:53.280
Door number three brings you fresh hot episodes every Wednesday.

41:53.280 --> 41:56.320
You can find them on iTunes and Maximumfun.org.

41:56.320 --> 41:57.280
Now pick a door.

41:57.280 --> 41:57.920
Just kidding.

41:57.920 --> 42:00.000
They're not real because we're a podcast.

42:00.000 --> 42:01.200
You're all winners.

42:01.200 --> 42:02.640
And we didn't really think this through.

42:03.200 --> 42:03.920
Lady to lady.

42:07.440 --> 42:09.760
I smoke a lot of pot, like a ton.

42:09.760 --> 42:12.080
Smoke weed every day.

42:12.080 --> 42:12.640
Every day.

42:13.280 --> 42:15.840
Oh, it actually says, sorry, it actually said every day there.

42:15.840 --> 42:16.640
I should have read ahead.

42:16.640 --> 42:16.880
Yes.

42:17.840 --> 42:20.880
I smoke a lot of pot, like a ton, every day.

42:20.880 --> 42:26.800
Probably not a ton every day, but I'm also serious and I think respectable person.

42:28.000 --> 42:30.080
I'm working on my second master's degree.

42:30.080 --> 42:33.040
I've maintained a 4.0 GPA throughout grad school.

42:33.040 --> 42:34.080
A 4.20.

42:35.920 --> 42:36.320
Okay.

42:36.320 --> 42:36.960
I see what you did.

42:36.960 --> 42:37.760
All right there.

42:37.760 --> 42:38.320
Pipe down.

42:38.320 --> 42:39.120
Smoke weed every day.

42:39.120 --> 42:42.240
Pipe down, okay.

42:43.680 --> 42:45.200
Let's calm down and hash this out.

42:45.200 --> 42:45.680
Stop it.

42:45.680 --> 42:45.920
Go.

42:46.640 --> 42:51.680
I am in a healthy long-term relationship and I still manage to have a lot of fun most of the time.

42:51.680 --> 42:52.160
Well, yeah.

42:53.120 --> 42:54.240
How can I get people?

42:57.680 --> 42:58.320
That's not it.

42:58.320 --> 42:59.440
That's not it for debate.

42:59.440 --> 42:59.680
Yeah.

43:00.800 --> 43:02.560
How can I get people to take me seriously?

43:02.560 --> 43:08.080
Even though I am now and have been for a long time and probably always will be a huge pothead.

43:08.080 --> 43:10.480
That's from Seriously Stone in Memphis.

43:10.480 --> 43:15.120
I will say this question is riddled with typographical errors.

43:15.120 --> 43:18.160
I will point that out up front.

43:19.760 --> 43:23.200
Man, I got a contact high off this email.

43:25.120 --> 43:30.160
In this day and age, in 2014, it's a hugely stigmatized thing.

43:32.000 --> 43:33.120
I don't give a fuck.

43:33.120 --> 43:37.520
Yeah, especially living in LA now, I know tons of people that smoke weed all the time.

43:37.520 --> 43:39.200
Did you say astigmatized?

43:40.160 --> 43:41.600
Like it doesn't have a stigma?

43:42.640 --> 43:45.360
No, it is a stigmatized thing.

43:46.160 --> 43:47.520
It is very stigmatized.

43:48.480 --> 43:50.240
But I don't give a fuck is the thing.

43:50.880 --> 43:52.240
And I don't think you guys do either.

43:52.240 --> 43:54.080
And we represent the real America.

43:54.800 --> 43:59.200
Yeah, but there is obviously, I mean, I don't think that this person would be asking this question

43:59.200 --> 44:04.000
if there wasn't a still pervasive stigma about people who smoke a lot of weed.

44:04.000 --> 44:05.040
I think they're paranoid.

44:05.040 --> 44:07.040
I think they're paranoid about nothing.

44:07.440 --> 44:11.520
I think if I ran a small or big business and you came in and you're like,

44:11.520 --> 44:14.960
I'd like a job at Google, smoke weed every day.

44:14.960 --> 44:16.160
I'd be like, cool, weed.

44:16.880 --> 44:18.240
So what are your qualifications?

44:18.240 --> 44:21.120
Would they be blazing it in your office?

44:21.120 --> 44:23.760
Yeah, they'd be chafing a 420 right there in front of you.

44:23.760 --> 44:26.960
I would be like, I'd be like, when can you start?

44:27.760 --> 44:30.400
I don't need a bunch of uptight prudes at Google.

44:30.400 --> 44:31.920
We're trying to invent the future here.

44:31.920 --> 44:37.760
I guess that's the question for the question asker is like, is this an actual thing you're encountering?

44:37.760 --> 44:43.120
Like, are your friends in there going like, hey man, we love you, but you smoke weed too much?

44:43.120 --> 44:46.160
Or are you just assuming that everyone is thinking that?

44:47.280 --> 44:48.480
I think that's a good question.

44:49.280 --> 44:50.400
I mean, how can we be sure?

44:51.120 --> 44:52.080
How can we be sure?

44:52.640 --> 44:54.080
How can he even be sure?

44:54.080 --> 44:57.520
I think that he has enough bona fides as like a grownup

44:58.320 --> 45:00.400
that he probably should just stop worrying about it.

45:00.400 --> 45:04.320
Yeah, I mean, until you get a gig where they're gonna start drug screening you,

45:05.440 --> 45:06.320
what does it matter?

45:06.320 --> 45:07.840
Why do you have to prove yourself to anybody?

45:07.840 --> 45:10.000
You have all these other things going for you.

45:10.000 --> 45:13.920
I just don't, I don't feel like it's holding you back in your day to day life.

45:13.920 --> 45:16.880
And as such, you shouldn't let other people's perception.

45:16.880 --> 45:18.240
You know what you should do?

45:18.240 --> 45:22.160
Be a little more open about it and you can start to change those stigmas.

45:22.160 --> 45:23.200
Think about that.

45:23.200 --> 45:26.240
Hey guys, I have a confession to make.

45:26.240 --> 45:31.280
I just thought of something from dare days that I've never like fact checked.

45:31.280 --> 45:35.520
And I wonder if you guys, does smoking weed kill brain cells?

45:35.520 --> 45:36.560
Not the important ones.

45:37.920 --> 45:40.160
Just like a few old telephone numbers.

45:40.160 --> 45:41.760
But I got all that shit in my phone now.

45:43.600 --> 45:45.760
I think that that's probably where that stigma comes from.

45:45.760 --> 45:48.160
That idea of like people who smoke weed are stupid

45:48.160 --> 45:50.800
and like kill brain cells and they're all burnouts.

45:50.800 --> 45:53.920
And it's like, okay, that's not cool.

45:53.920 --> 45:54.880
That's not true.

45:54.880 --> 45:57.840
That's garbage. Say fuck you, Jim Henson.

45:57.840 --> 45:59.280
Go eat an ass.

45:59.280 --> 46:00.240
You don't know anything.

46:01.120 --> 46:04.000
Isn't that like saying that everyone who like has a beer

46:04.000 --> 46:08.320
ends up face down in a gutter, you know, throwing up on themselves?

46:08.320 --> 46:09.200
Like that's not true.

46:09.200 --> 46:10.320
That's not true at all.

46:10.320 --> 46:16.240
Steve Jobs drank a lot of beer and he invented the way we listen to music now.

46:16.240 --> 46:17.200
I think you're paranoid.

46:17.200 --> 46:18.560
I think you're imagining things.

46:18.560 --> 46:20.720
I want you to drink this Gatorade

46:20.720 --> 46:26.640
and why don't you go lie down in my room for a little while?

46:26.640 --> 46:27.760
Uh, y'all want a yahoo?

46:28.400 --> 46:29.040
Yeah, please.

46:29.600 --> 46:30.560
I hope we weren't mean.

46:30.560 --> 46:31.680
I really don't give a fuck.

46:31.680 --> 46:34.880
And I just like, I don't think anyone gives a fuck.

46:34.880 --> 46:37.680
Unless they're like 50 or 60 years old, in which case, fuck them.

46:38.880 --> 46:40.480
Uh, here is a yahoo.

46:41.280 --> 46:44.240
And it was sent in by Rachel Sperling.

46:44.240 --> 46:45.280
Thank you, Rachel.

46:45.280 --> 46:45.920
Crushing it.

46:45.920 --> 46:48.000
It's by yahoo answers user, Mike, who asks,

46:48.000 --> 46:51.760
how do I convince my girlfriend to stop pooping completely?

46:54.560 --> 46:55.060
Wait.

46:55.680 --> 47:02.880
I gotta say that I, um, Mike has asked this question before on yahoo.

47:05.600 --> 47:08.560
He's asked this question, let's just.

47:08.560 --> 47:10.400
No satisfactory answers, I'm assuming.

47:10.400 --> 47:14.720
Um, I don't want to be blue, but he's asked this question a fuckload of times.

47:14.720 --> 47:16.160
Before you clarify,

47:16.160 --> 47:21.040
I just want you to know, I don't know if he means how do I get my girlfriend to completely stop pooping,

47:21.040 --> 47:24.640
or how do I get my girlfriend to stop pooping completely?

47:24.640 --> 47:25.120
She poops all of it.

47:25.120 --> 47:28.000
You're saying she gets 60% of the way done, and is like.

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
D'yup!

47:31.520 --> 47:33.120
It's like you barely swallowed me.

47:33.120 --> 47:35.440
I know there's no way the air don't poop again.

47:35.440 --> 47:42.720
Um, here's a, so Mike, extra details.

47:42.720 --> 47:45.600
Unfortunately, my girlfriend poops at least 20 times a day.

47:45.600 --> 47:50.080
My girlfriend poops at least once each day, and usually twice every day.

47:50.080 --> 47:50.580
Wait.

47:53.840 --> 47:56.800
Mike, those are not irrational numbers.

47:56.800 --> 47:57.520
You know what, guys?

47:57.520 --> 47:59.680
I think this is a fakey fake bullshit.

47:59.680 --> 48:01.200
Yeah, I think probably it is.

48:01.200 --> 48:03.440
Here's a yahoo, a real yahoo.

48:04.560 --> 48:06.960
Nice try, Rachel Sperling, trying to trick me.

48:07.520 --> 48:08.960
This one was sent in by Drew Davenport.

48:08.960 --> 48:09.520
Thank you, Drew.

48:10.080 --> 48:12.320
Uh, with this legit yahoo.

48:12.320 --> 48:16.800
Asked by yahoo answers user Thomas, who asks, I want to be born in 400 years.

48:18.160 --> 48:20.800
I don't like being born in the 1990s.

48:20.800 --> 48:25.440
I know I get to grow up and play with iPads and cars and stuff, but I want more.

48:26.240 --> 48:30.480
The people 500 years ago couldn't imagine having microwaves or TV or spaceships.

48:30.480 --> 48:33.920
I feel like future people will make fun of me for being primitive.

48:33.920 --> 48:38.160
I want to live in a world where I can visit grandma on Mars and be back by dinner.

48:38.160 --> 48:42.400
I want to order a hoverboard from eBay and have it delivered via drone.

48:42.400 --> 48:47.680
I want to choose what color my baby's eyes will be and if it will be a boy or a girl.

48:47.680 --> 48:50.080
I can imagine those evil bastards up now.

48:51.120 --> 48:55.520
I can imagine those evil bastards up there right now living in glass domes on the moon,

48:55.520 --> 49:00.880
looking back at us 2014 earth dwellers and our non-hovering cars and our non-robotic dogs.

49:00.880 --> 49:01.920
Wait, what?

49:01.920 --> 49:06.480
I want to be there when they announce that NASA has discovered alien life on another planet

49:06.480 --> 49:09.520
and broadcast it live on HDTVs in every home.

49:09.520 --> 49:12.400
Pretty sure they did that already.

49:12.400 --> 49:18.960
I want a goddamn robot hand so at the gym I can bench press 400,000 metric tons of steel,

49:18.960 --> 49:23.360
then use my jet pack to fly back to my underwater home on Venus.

49:23.360 --> 49:25.680
But now I just live in a house and go to school.

49:28.080 --> 49:28.720
I don't...

49:29.760 --> 49:31.200
Okay, what's this question?

49:31.200 --> 49:31.760
Answer his name.

49:33.040 --> 49:33.520
Thomas.

49:33.520 --> 49:42.320
The best idea that Thomas has conceived of is that in 500 years people will get together

49:42.320 --> 49:44.560
and just be like, fucking Thomas.

49:44.560 --> 49:48.000
That fool didn't have none of this shit.

49:48.000 --> 49:49.760
Look at this dip shit.

49:49.760 --> 49:50.480
Look at him.

49:50.480 --> 49:55.920
I'm just gonna put my hands on the wheel and steer this car around again.

49:55.920 --> 49:56.720
Look at this guy.

49:56.720 --> 50:01.200
If you'll flip in your holobooks to page 136, you'll see a picture of Thomas,

50:01.200 --> 50:03.440
the worst person in history ever.

50:03.440 --> 50:07.920
Now I'm looking here at Thomas's dog and it looks like this is once made out of meat.

50:07.920 --> 50:08.560
How could this be?

50:08.560 --> 50:09.360
That's correct.

50:09.360 --> 50:09.680
Teacher.

50:09.680 --> 50:11.120
Thomas didn't have shit.

50:11.120 --> 50:13.600
Teacher, how could this meat dog be?

50:13.600 --> 50:15.840
Now if you're gonna ask a question, raise your robot hand.

50:16.880 --> 50:18.720
Oh fuck, I punched the school part.

50:19.920 --> 50:23.120
I like that Thomas thinks that if he had a robot hand that could lift a bunch of weight,

50:23.120 --> 50:24.880
he'd still be going to the gym.

50:24.880 --> 50:25.380
Yeah.

50:26.240 --> 50:27.280
What are you doing?

50:27.280 --> 50:30.000
Are you going to build up the muscles on your robot hand, Thomas?

50:30.000 --> 50:31.520
I don't think you deserve the future.

50:31.520 --> 50:34.080
He wants big muscles to impress his Mars grandma.

50:35.840 --> 50:37.280
You're looking fit, Thomas.

50:37.280 --> 50:38.480
Thank you, Mars grandma.

50:38.480 --> 50:41.600
You're still so young and sexy, even though you're 200 Earth years old.

50:43.040 --> 50:45.040
I wish you hadn't moved to Mars.

50:45.040 --> 50:47.600
I wish you- Can I say something though, gramps?

50:47.600 --> 50:49.040
Little inconvenient for me.

50:49.680 --> 50:51.040
I mean, I do live on Venus.

50:51.760 --> 50:53.520
I guess it's on the way, but not really.

50:53.520 --> 50:54.800
It's in the other direction, isn't it?

50:55.360 --> 50:56.480
Should have thought about that.

50:56.480 --> 50:57.440
I miss you, ma.

50:57.440 --> 50:59.040
I miss you so much, Thomas.

50:59.040 --> 51:00.160
I miss you so much, grandma.

51:00.160 --> 51:01.840
I miss your sexy tone game.

51:01.840 --> 51:03.920
It's your super, super sexy legs.

51:04.880 --> 51:05.600
Robot legs.

51:06.400 --> 51:07.760
I do miss your meat legs though.

51:09.200 --> 51:11.200
Anyway, what color do you want my baby's eyes to be?

51:13.760 --> 51:15.440
We're letting you pick this week.

51:15.440 --> 51:17.200
We're being really mean to Thomas right now.

51:17.200 --> 51:19.520
How can we get him to be born in 400 years?

51:19.520 --> 51:22.640
We sound like a bunch of people from 2400.

51:24.480 --> 51:25.520
Thomas.

51:25.520 --> 51:26.320
Thomas.

51:26.320 --> 51:28.880
How can we get him born in 400 years?

51:28.880 --> 51:33.600
I was about to harangue Thomas for his inability to visualize a future more robust

51:33.600 --> 51:38.560
than we'll see in next year's Call of Duty game, but I'm having a hard time-

51:38.560 --> 51:40.640
Call of Duty sexy grandmas.

51:41.360 --> 51:42.720
Visit them on Venus.

51:43.280 --> 51:43.840
Shoot them.

51:45.360 --> 51:49.760
But I'm having a hard time visualizing a way to solve this problem for him.

51:49.760 --> 51:51.760
There's gotta be a way to solve this problem.

51:51.760 --> 51:52.320
Tar pits?

51:52.320 --> 51:55.040
A really cold room.

51:56.400 --> 51:57.120
That might work.

51:57.120 --> 52:01.680
I've slept in a hotel room with Justin before and he treats that thermostat

52:02.480 --> 52:06.480
like he is suspending himself or trying to turn himself into jerky or something.

52:07.360 --> 52:12.720
I mean, if you could get in a vehicle going fast enough, then time would move

52:12.720 --> 52:16.240
slower to you relative to the people on Earth and you could wait it out.

52:17.040 --> 52:20.800
He wants to be born in 400 years.

52:20.800 --> 52:23.920
Mm, well first you're gonna have to be unborn.

52:23.920 --> 52:24.480
Damn.

52:24.480 --> 52:25.120
How's that work?

52:26.240 --> 52:30.000
Well, it's a pretty intricate process, but basically you just gotta crawl up into a womb.

52:34.000 --> 52:34.720
What?

52:34.720 --> 52:38.480
I'm having a hard time finding a womb that can support me.

52:38.480 --> 52:40.960
Well that, I mean, that's why everyone's not doing it.

52:40.960 --> 52:43.760
Does it have to be a human womb or a gorilla's womb?

52:43.760 --> 52:48.240
I could probably find one that will find a suitable silverback.

52:48.240 --> 52:52.240
Here's the thing, Griffin, it could be a completely manufactured womb.

52:52.240 --> 52:56.560
Can you get into a blue whale's womb from a blowhole or what's this stuff there?

52:58.400 --> 53:01.120
Hey blue whale, hey blue whale, what's the story?

53:02.800 --> 53:04.160
Where does your stuff connect?

53:07.120 --> 53:13.440
Do I have to go through their weird stringy mouth and get fucking plankton and grill all over here?

53:13.440 --> 53:16.720
I don't want to be born in 400 years covered in plankton.

53:16.720 --> 53:19.520
Hey blue whale, what's your life expectancy?

53:19.520 --> 53:22.240
I don't want to have to hop from blue whale to blue whale.

53:22.240 --> 53:24.480
Do you live for 400 years like a tree?

53:25.920 --> 53:26.800
Oh man.

53:27.520 --> 53:29.600
What if that was the original plot of Cocoon?

53:31.520 --> 53:33.920
So all you have to do to feel revitalized?

53:39.360 --> 53:39.840
And then it's just-

53:39.840 --> 53:43.280
Hold on, I'm cutting a giant hole in a blue whale with a chainsaw.

53:43.280 --> 53:43.920
It's-

53:43.920 --> 53:49.200
I thought they smelled bad on the outside.

53:49.200 --> 53:50.480
So much gooshing.

53:53.680 --> 53:56.480
I thought there would be some gooshing, but this is just-

53:57.520 --> 54:00.400
This is an unconscionable amount of gooshing.

54:00.400 --> 54:03.360
And I was never allowed in a sea world again.

54:03.920 --> 54:07.440
I guess it's time for me to admit, I don't know where the whale's womb is.

54:07.440 --> 54:09.360
I just want to kill a whale.

54:10.800 --> 54:12.160
To feel alive again.

54:12.160 --> 54:14.560
I just want to feel alive, now don't you feel younger?

54:15.200 --> 54:17.280
Help me kill this whale, Steve Guttenberg.

54:18.240 --> 54:20.880
Was he in that movie or am I thinking of batteries not included?

54:20.880 --> 54:23.120
You're thinking exactly of batteries not included.

54:25.120 --> 54:26.320
We're going to get better at this.

54:30.800 --> 54:31.920
Give us a few more episodes.

54:31.920 --> 54:32.960
Give us just a few.

54:32.960 --> 54:37.600
Listen, you've been, you've stuck around for 229 trial episodes.

54:37.600 --> 54:38.800
We're going to get it together.

54:38.800 --> 54:42.480
I feel it, the winds, the winds, they are blowing.

54:43.680 --> 54:46.720
That's going to do it for our comedy show, my brother, my brother, and me.

54:47.440 --> 54:52.320
We hope that you had some salvage, some sort of pleasure from it.

54:52.880 --> 54:55.440
Just real quick to review our brand expansion.

54:56.560 --> 54:59.120
The Adventure Zone is on iTunes.

54:59.120 --> 55:03.520
Please go subscribe and rate and review that and tell your friends about it.

55:04.640 --> 55:07.680
Every other Thursday, we're going to be posting new-

55:07.680 --> 55:11.120
The launch of any podcast is your best shot at exposure.

55:11.680 --> 55:15.760
If you can help us spread the word about that, it would be super helpful for us.

55:16.480 --> 55:17.680
The same for Bunker Buddies.

55:18.800 --> 55:20.000
I really, really love it.

55:20.000 --> 55:22.720
I'm very proud of it and I hope you go check it out and then tell everyone.

55:22.720 --> 55:26.720
Rate, review, word of mouth is the best advertisement we have for any of our shows.

55:26.720 --> 55:31.200
My brother, my brother, and me, The Adventure Zone, Bunker Buddies, and Sawbones too.

55:31.200 --> 55:33.440
If you're a fan of this show and you've never listened to Sawbones,

55:33.440 --> 55:35.360
you are a crazy person and you should go check it out.

55:35.360 --> 55:36.240
My wife and I love it.

55:36.240 --> 55:40.720
We listen to it every week, Justin and Sidney host a show about all of the medical-

55:42.160 --> 55:42.640
What do you say?

55:44.240 --> 55:46.160
It's a marital tour of misguided medicine.

55:46.160 --> 55:46.720
There you go.

55:47.360 --> 55:48.000
Go check it out.

55:48.000 --> 55:50.640
It's hilarious and informative and it's really, really great.

55:50.640 --> 55:52.080
And don't forget about Big Gulp.

55:53.280 --> 55:53.840
It's real.

55:55.120 --> 55:59.040
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song.

55:59.040 --> 56:00.960
It's a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

56:00.960 --> 56:07.040
Go, go just buy that album a few times because at this point we owe them a lot.

56:07.040 --> 56:10.560
We said we would get them a lot more purchases than we've actually been able to pull off.

56:10.560 --> 56:14.000
So if you could just download it like 10 or 20 times, it would be super helpful.

56:14.720 --> 56:16.640
We also want to say thanks again to Hulu Plus.

56:17.440 --> 56:20.000
Hulu Plus, it's an amazing thing and if you haven't gone to check it out,

56:20.000 --> 56:21.280
then you're probably living-

56:21.280 --> 56:22.080
Of course you have though.

56:22.080 --> 56:22.640
What do we-

56:22.640 --> 56:27.680
Yeah, it's like, it's like 400 year from now technology just happening now.

56:27.680 --> 56:31.280
Just go to huluplus.com slash my brother and you'll get a free extended trial,

56:31.840 --> 56:35.200
a two week free trial to check out everything awesome on Hulu Plus.

56:35.200 --> 56:36.000
What are you waiting for?

56:38.560 --> 56:39.760
Is that going to do for us?

56:39.760 --> 56:42.560
Also, Candlelight tickets are still on sale.

56:42.560 --> 56:43.120
Oh, right.

56:43.120 --> 56:46.720
So go to bit.ly forward slash Candlelight's live.

56:46.720 --> 56:47.840
Tickets are only $15.

56:48.480 --> 56:52.800
There's a special deal at the Pullman Hotel where you can get $99 a night.

56:52.800 --> 56:55.200
It's a special rate, so make sure that when you contact them,

56:55.200 --> 56:57.920
tell them that you're coming in for the NBNB AM show.

56:58.720 --> 57:02.880
And if you have any questions, Candlelight related, send them to us.

57:02.880 --> 57:04.560
Make sure to put Candlelight in the subject.

57:04.560 --> 57:07.920
And if you're going to be at the show, make sure you put that in the email as well

57:08.720 --> 57:10.640
and have some questions ready for the show.

57:10.640 --> 57:13.040
And we'll probably do some audience live questions.

57:13.040 --> 57:15.680
And as long as you're, as long as you're in the ticket buying mood,

57:15.680 --> 57:18.640
there are still a few more tickets left from X Fun Con.

57:19.840 --> 57:23.760
Maybe, I don't know, we're recording this one actually pretty early, so check.

57:23.760 --> 57:26.880
Yeah, last time I checked, it was at 80% sold out, so.

57:26.880 --> 57:30.160
And this is Thursday, so God only knows.

57:30.160 --> 57:34.880
But if there are any available, you should get them because it's super, super, super fun.

57:34.880 --> 57:38.400
Last I heard from, as far as NBNB AM merch goes,

57:38.400 --> 57:42.000
if you want to get any for people for Christmas, you should order it like now

57:42.640 --> 57:44.960
because it's going to get backed up for the holiday season

57:44.960 --> 57:46.480
and you're going to want that before Christmas.

57:46.480 --> 57:47.760
So make sure you go to that now.

57:47.760 --> 57:51.520
You can go to maxfunstore.com and all of the max fun merch is there.

57:51.520 --> 57:54.400
There's sawbone shirts as well that we've got tote bags.

57:54.400 --> 57:55.680
We've got t-shirts.

57:55.680 --> 57:58.000
We've got a bunch of NBNB AM stuff, so go check it out.

57:59.200 --> 58:00.400
That's going to do us.

58:00.400 --> 58:01.040
Yeah.

58:01.040 --> 58:04.080
Final Yah Drew Nights Mystery sent in by Drew Davenport.

58:04.080 --> 58:04.560
Thank you, Drew.

58:04.560 --> 58:05.040
It's by Yahoo!

58:05.040 --> 58:06.560
Ancestors user Jamie who asks,

58:08.800 --> 58:12.000
did Elvis have hairy legs or smooth silky ones?

58:15.040 --> 58:16.000
I'm Justin McElroy.

58:16.000 --> 58:17.120
I'm Travis McElroy.

58:17.120 --> 58:18.240
I'm Griffin McElroy.

58:18.240 --> 58:20.080
Is Griffin my better, my brother, or me?

58:20.080 --> 58:21.600
Is Griffin my better, my brother, or me?

58:21.600 --> 58:22.000
Kiss your dad.

58:22.000 --> 58:24.160
And that's a premium swallow.

58:24.160 --> 58:26.000
I'm dead.

58:43.200 --> 58:45.120
Maximumfun.org.

58:45.120 --> 58:46.160
Comedy and culture.

58:46.160 --> 58:47.280
Artist owned.

58:47.280 --> 58:48.400
Listener supported.

58:48.400 --> 58:49.680
Hello, I'm Taco.

58:49.680 --> 58:50.880
The elephant magician.

58:50.880 --> 58:54.800
Moral High Church here, the master of clerical magic.

58:54.800 --> 58:57.280
I'm Magnus Burnside, the fighter.

58:57.280 --> 58:58.320
Did you guys like that?

58:59.040 --> 59:01.120
Did you, the listener, like that?

59:01.120 --> 59:04.160
You were just swept up in a world of high fantasy and magic

59:04.160 --> 59:06.640
where anything can happen and anything is possible.

59:06.640 --> 59:09.440
Hi, I'm Griffin McElroy, dungeon master for the Adventure Zone,

59:09.440 --> 59:13.280
a new podcast on Maximum Fun in which magic and mystery intertwine

59:13.280 --> 59:17.040
for a very erotically charged role-playing experience.

59:17.040 --> 59:20.480
You can catch it every other Thursday here on Maximumfun.org or iTunes.

59:20.480 --> 59:47.360
It's for Dungeons and Dragons, but with family.
