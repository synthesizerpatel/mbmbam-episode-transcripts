WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.640 --> 00:56.400
This is the international episode of my brother, my brother and me from around the globe.

01:01.600 --> 01:07.600
Now, that's my brother, my brother and you, isn't it? Yes, right. Damn it. How's it going?

01:13.760 --> 01:15.040
How are your goofs today?

01:18.400 --> 01:22.560
Pardon me, goof maker. How much for a fresh dozen of goofs?

01:22.560 --> 01:28.800
This is all the French I know.

01:28.800 --> 01:35.120
Moments before the show started that today is the international episode of my brother,

01:35.120 --> 01:39.120
my brother and me. It's the international. It's my brother, my brother and me you love,

01:39.120 --> 01:50.160
but it's got a crippling economy like in Europe. Sorry, it's like when guts had global guts

01:50.160 --> 01:56.080
and then all of a sudden there were French kids for American. And America was just whipping.

01:56.080 --> 02:00.480
America was just grinding them in a prepubescent pace. They have no,

02:01.600 --> 02:06.080
they have nothing in their culture to prepare them. They don't even put steroids in their

02:06.080 --> 02:11.920
chicken. That radical rock had nothing. What has braced you for this? Travis, what do they call the

02:11.920 --> 02:20.560
uh, the agro crag in, in France? Uh, the, the agro with cheese. Wait, no, fuck.

02:24.080 --> 02:29.520
Thank you. You're wonderful. So we do have an international flair on this episode of my brother,

02:29.520 --> 02:35.120
my brother, me and advice show for the modern era. I am your oldest brother, Jose McElroy.

02:35.120 --> 02:41.760
I'm your middle-est brother, Vladimir McElroy. And I am your baby brother.

02:46.640 --> 02:49.840
Wait, was that a language or did you become the scat man?

02:51.440 --> 02:57.440
It's like lady smith black, my brother, my brother and me in, in portal prints. Uh,

02:57.440 --> 03:03.200
scat man is, is the, the primary language. The national language is scat man in the city.

03:03.200 --> 03:08.240
The national language is in the city of Port-au-Prince. The national language is scat man.

03:08.240 --> 03:13.600
He's a national hero down there. National on a city level. He's the Prince of Port-au-Prince.

03:15.120 --> 03:21.920
Basically in the, in the Prince of the city because they held the elections and he won

03:21.920 --> 03:26.160
the election for Prince of the city. Right. He couldn't be mayor because he doesn't have,

03:26.160 --> 03:30.960
he does not have a, you know, a government background. So it's more of a figurehead

03:30.960 --> 03:36.480
position. He beat out Lou Bega, which, which was quite the coup. Um, literally.

03:37.440 --> 03:43.120
The Lou Bega militia, uh, had a few things to say about it. Um, this is of course, uh,

03:43.120 --> 03:48.880
my brother, my brother and me. We take your questions, your queries, and some unsolicited

03:48.880 --> 03:52.480
questions and queries from the, uh, terrible people at Yahoo Answers,

03:52.480 --> 03:56.560
and we turn them alchemy-like into wisdom. Uh, let's get right to it.

03:56.560 --> 04:01.760
My boyfriend, a PhD student, is leaving to do dissertation research in Scotland for two months.

04:02.480 --> 04:09.360
Do you have any advice on how to cope with being apart? Scotland's a country, guys. Huh?

04:09.360 --> 04:13.920
I, I love doing this show early in the morning cause it takes my voice down here. I sound like,

04:13.920 --> 04:21.680
I sound like Rick Dees. Sound like Lou Bega. I love it. Uh, it's tough. I, I'm glad you included

04:21.680 --> 04:28.080
his location where he's traveling to. Because if you were like, my boyfriend is leaving to go to

04:28.080 --> 04:34.000
some whack country for two months, then it'd be like, okay, we can help you here. But he's going

04:34.000 --> 04:39.840
to Scotland and Scotland's pretty dope. I wish he had included where she will remain though,

04:39.840 --> 04:47.440
right? Cause if she's in the UK, then she's not there. From kicking it in, kicking it in Des Moines.

04:47.440 --> 04:55.440
Uh, I, I guess Skype video calling is good for this sort of thing. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. You could

04:55.440 --> 05:00.880
Google, you could Google hang out him. You could Google Buzz him. Just hit him up on Google Buzz.

05:00.880 --> 05:04.400
Yeah. You could, uh, both sign up for eHarmony and see if it syncs you up there.

05:04.400 --> 05:07.840
Mm-hmm. Although I can't imagine- That sounds like a great idea.

05:07.840 --> 05:12.480
I can't imagine they would pair a man in Scotland and a woman in Des Moines and maybe you should

05:12.480 --> 05:17.440
take a hint, but I don't know. Maybe it's not going to work out for a couple. Have you thought

05:17.440 --> 05:24.560
about taking a couple months off? Just, uh, being you, you know? So you're not saying like be single

05:24.560 --> 05:29.600
and not like break up for two months, but just like mentally. I'm just saying mentally kind of

05:29.600 --> 05:34.960
inception them out of your mind, right? Take that, take that, uh, eternal sunshine and the spotless

05:34.960 --> 05:38.320
mind pill and just kind of forget they exist for two months. Have you seen- Think of it like summer

05:38.320 --> 05:44.240
vacation. Have you seen the film you just referenced? Yes. Yes. Eternal Sun- Sunshine.

05:45.680 --> 05:51.920
And it's just him just takes, just Jim Carrey just poppin', poppin' Xannies. He takes the limitless

05:51.920 --> 05:56.960
pill. He takes the limitless pill and he forgets, but he gets, he gets it now. See, my problem with

05:56.960 --> 06:01.920
that movie has always been that he goes overboard. So it's not just he takes the pill to forget Kate

06:01.920 --> 06:06.720
Winslet dumped him. He forgets, like Kate Winslet will go to the store. She's like,

06:06.720 --> 06:11.360
Kate Winslet will go to the store and he'll take the pill. That'll help. Yeah. Cause you know,

06:11.360 --> 06:15.680
he didn't want to be lonely for like 20 minutes. And I think that's, that's probably a substance.

06:15.680 --> 06:19.920
And then it starts to get weird when he starts to take the pill to forget Elijah Wood. Yeah.

06:21.040 --> 06:27.600
And then he does it to forget algebra. And then he, and then he does it to forget that the

06:28.320 --> 06:34.320
lady is actually a man in the crying game, which I don't know how they made that specific a pill.

06:34.320 --> 06:41.120
Well, it's everybody remembers their first time watching the crying game. That's a magical,

06:41.120 --> 06:46.720
that's a magical shock. There actually is a, I think there's a generation of people that,

06:46.720 --> 06:51.440
and I would include myself in this generation, where they through osmosis learned the,

06:52.160 --> 06:58.480
the turn of the movie, but did not actually see the movie. Oh, that's a shame. I have no

06:58.480 --> 07:02.800
idea what the movie is about, but I know that the woman is a man. Yeah. Right. It's powerful.

07:02.800 --> 07:08.960
It's a powerful movie. I think it's a Willem Dafoe, right? Willem Dafoe, but he has a,

07:10.400 --> 07:18.800
yeah, it's like Willem Dafoe, but with a vagina. I only watch the vagina. I only watch Willem Dafoe

07:18.800 --> 07:26.160
movies. If he's dressed like the green goblin or throwing hot wax on Madonna. That's like half the

07:26.160 --> 07:34.000
movies. Yeah. It's half of his, half of his, his criterion collection is actually solely movies

07:34.000 --> 07:38.720
where he plays the green goblin and or throws hot wax. Now, if we could get those two flavors

07:38.720 --> 07:48.400
together, how about it, Coen brothers? Just, just give me that. You know, I was actually exactly,

07:48.400 --> 07:54.480
pretty much exactly in the situation. Mine of course was far harder because my wife did not have

07:54.480 --> 08:02.960
access to the high band internet required for Skype and such. And it, you will level out on the,

08:04.240 --> 08:07.520
on the missing the person that will be the worst at the beginning. And then you'll,

08:07.520 --> 08:15.280
you'll kind of get into a rhythm. Um, try to, if you're, if you're in a long-term relationship,

08:15.840 --> 08:22.560
it's, it's going to suck because you, you get into this mindset that it's going to be the two of you

08:22.560 --> 08:28.800
two of you. And it'll be weird to have experiences that are just you. Um, and that's the thing that's

08:28.800 --> 08:35.040
going to suck the most, I think. And there's going to be a temptation to not have any sort

08:35.040 --> 08:41.760
of memorable experiences, you know, for, for fear that you'll create a, a, some sort of imbalance

08:41.760 --> 08:46.240
there. But you gotta remember that he's going to be doing, you know, completely foreign, completely

08:46.240 --> 08:53.760
new stuff. And you shouldn't keep yourself from, um, also doing interesting things. When Sydney

08:53.760 --> 08:58.480
was gone, I got into new stuff. I got into like, uh, what we've talked about on the show before.

08:58.480 --> 09:02.880
I got in like geocaching while she was gone, you know, things that maybe she wouldn't have any

09:02.880 --> 09:08.640
interest in, but I, I thought I'd pursue. And, uh, and, and that really helped to make the time

09:08.640 --> 09:15.680
seem full, even though it obviously wasn't full because my, my best bud said wasn't around, but

09:15.680 --> 09:21.680
so get like really into drugs. Yeah. Well, no, find some experience that you would be ashamed

09:21.680 --> 09:28.000
to do in front of him, like geocaching, like an eyes wide shut kind of sex party. Well, Travis,

09:28.000 --> 09:34.560
again, yeah. Imagine the thrill of him coming home and him showing you three baubles that he

09:34.560 --> 09:39.920
brought for you from Scotland said, these are great, Phillip. Now watch this. And you juggle

09:39.920 --> 09:47.280
them. Imagine his eyes bugging out of his head as you toss them aloft and catch them and toss them

09:47.280 --> 09:54.880
until he gets bored, which is of course 20 seconds later. Hey jugglers, by the way, hey jugglers,

09:54.880 --> 10:05.280
I can stream like every TV show ever made through a screen on my desk. Uh, your juggling is

10:05.280 --> 10:11.840
entertaining anybody. Nobody wants to see anybody juggle ever again. Can I make a side note about

10:11.840 --> 10:16.800
juggling that blows my mind? Can we just talk about juggling for juggling? Here's why I love

10:16.800 --> 10:23.280
juggling. Juggling is one of the few like, uh, things that people do that requires constant

10:23.280 --> 10:29.280
escalation. Like, Oh, okay. You can do three balls. That's awesome. Now do four. Okay. Now

10:29.280 --> 10:36.720
do like knives. Now do chainsaws. Now do babies. If properly executed it, juggling can only end

10:36.720 --> 10:46.080
in your death. Yeah. If you're into some like Greg Kennedy, like pro style juggling maneuvers,

10:46.080 --> 10:51.200
like that can still, that's like a fucking air show. That's entertaining. He's the dude who got

10:51.200 --> 10:56.320
in the cone and he juggles in the cone and he'll like throw the ball onto the, like against the

10:56.320 --> 11:02.320
cone and I'll like spin around him and like this beautiful perpetual orbit and then I'll catch him

11:02.320 --> 11:07.520
again and just like keep on juggling them. He sounds like an innovative juggler, which is easy

11:07.520 --> 11:14.240
to remember since his website is innovative juggler.com. You know what I like to do? I like

11:14.240 --> 11:21.760
to just toss to one of something to a juggler and just like go to town. Yeah. Enjoy that. It's very

11:21.760 --> 11:26.480
zen. It's very zen. What's the sound of one ball juggling? I really liked there was a craze that

11:26.480 --> 11:32.160
took off for about, I don't know, about a month and a half in college of, it was like single

11:32.160 --> 11:38.000
object juggling. And so as a ball, you know how David Bowie just like made love to those dream

11:38.000 --> 11:53.520
bubbles in Labra? That's pretty much all it was. You're talking about fushigi. Is that,

11:55.200 --> 12:00.480
do you know what that's called? Did you pull that from? Have you never seen the fucking infomercials

12:00.480 --> 12:05.600
where it's like that glittery, you know, silvery ball that you make dance around your fingertips

12:05.600 --> 12:12.720
and shit. And every five seconds the crowd's like fushigi. No, but it's, that sounds like a raw and

12:12.720 --> 12:18.960
primal power. I imagine that fushigi was the gift for like two Christmases that aunts and uncles

12:18.960 --> 12:22.720
gave their nieces and nephews. Cause we didn't know them very well. Oh, cool. What's it? Oh,

12:22.720 --> 12:27.600
devil sticks. Thanks dad. See, this is why we need to get, we needed to get a,

12:29.040 --> 12:33.760
we need to get a PO box or something. Cause it seems like the kind of conversation where after

12:33.760 --> 12:38.880
right people would just flood, who would just flood the boxes with fushigi balls. Yeah. How

12:38.880 --> 12:47.440
many fushigis today, Donald? You know, I'm ordering a fushigi. Fushigi. Fushigi. You guys want a yahoo?

12:47.440 --> 12:55.760
Yeah, please. This yahoo answer was sent in by Maxwell McCandless. Thank you, Max. It's by yahoo

12:55.760 --> 13:01.760
answers user question mark who asks, is there any good dating sites for 13 year olds?

13:01.760 --> 13:09.680
I am single and need a boyfriend ASAP. I am lonely. Oh my God. Here's a good dating site

13:09.680 --> 13:18.400
for 13 year olds. The playground. I like to think that there's a secret context to

13:18.960 --> 13:26.000
every yahoo answer question that it actually does end with an unwritten I am lonely.

13:26.000 --> 13:34.320
But this person went ahead and filled that out. Additional details. Check that box. Additional

13:34.320 --> 13:42.480
details. Fuck y'all. So I guess the answers that this person got. I want your help, but fuck you.

13:42.480 --> 13:47.760
This is a pretty cool 13 year old actually. I'm kind of into it. I can't believe she's single.

13:47.760 --> 13:55.520
Huh? Yeah. Somebody lock that down. Wait before her looks start to go. Too late.

13:57.680 --> 14:03.360
How can you be 13 and lonely? You're surrounded by other 13. Oh wait. Unless homeschooled.

14:06.160 --> 14:10.000
Trapped on an island. That's, I said homeschooled. Okay.

14:10.000 --> 14:15.280
Um, that's really the only scenario I can, unless like you're just striking out at the school that

14:15.280 --> 14:22.800
you're going to, which is we've all been there. Like I, I was very, I was wildly unpopular. Um,

14:22.800 --> 14:29.520
in middle school, high school, elementary school. I did okay. Um, but I, I had a bunch of friends,

14:29.520 --> 14:36.480
other schools, but I had no access to them. Right. That's the time I was 13. I dated everyone at my

14:36.480 --> 14:41.040
school. You know, I just worked my way through the ranks. Yeah. I had fucked my way through.

14:43.040 --> 14:47.760
What I'm, I'm very much like yourself, Griffin, especially in middle school, which I guess is

14:47.760 --> 14:52.640
where you'd be at about 13. Right. Be like six. I was like, I would, I would compare myself to

14:52.640 --> 14:57.920
the Chris Gaines of my middle school. People were not having it. They were not enjoying it.

14:57.920 --> 15:01.760
Believe you were a real person. They didn't believe it was a real person. I didn't have a girl.

15:01.760 --> 15:10.800
Sleep it. I can sleep at night because I knew that, man, if I was kicking it over at, uh,

15:10.800 --> 15:17.280
Beverly Hills middle school, oh man, that's where my friend base was. That's where my core competency

15:17.280 --> 15:21.840
is. They know me. The people know me there. You're known there. You're a known quantity.

15:21.840 --> 15:27.120
Yeah. Take me out of Comac. Take me over to kick me over to Innslow. And I am all of a sudden,

15:27.120 --> 15:34.160
I'm, I'm, you know, I'm Dougie fresh. Yeah. Is that, is he a known popular man in middle school,

15:34.160 --> 15:39.280
in middle school, middle schoolers love Dougie. Take me over, take me over to Beverly,

15:39.280 --> 15:44.240
Beverly Hills middle school. I'm, I'm Urkel. I'm Steve Urkel over there. Yeah. But if you take me

15:44.240 --> 15:51.520
to, if you take me to Innslow, I'm Stefan Urkel, Stefan Urkel. Exactly. Although, you know, kids in,

15:51.520 --> 15:57.440
if Urkel had shown up at your school, like, oh man, when you're 13, oh, forget about it.

15:57.440 --> 16:03.040
It's fucking Elvis. School would have shut down for the day. Oh my God. He said the thing about

16:03.040 --> 16:10.640
cheese. The red power ranger came to my elementary school and he did a backflip off of the stage.

16:10.640 --> 16:14.960
And he bit his, he bit it too. I remember I was there, I was in fifth and you were in first.

16:15.760 --> 16:19.600
Oh, it was hilarious. Nice try. Austin St. John, was that his name or was that the wrestler?

16:19.600 --> 16:25.360
Uh, Austin St. John was the, uh, is that right? I think he was the green. Was he the green ranger?

16:25.360 --> 16:28.240
Yeah, the red ranger. The original red ranger became the green ranger.

16:29.120 --> 16:33.360
No. Fuck you. Tommy was the green ranger and then he became the white ranger. Tommy was the green

16:33.360 --> 16:38.880
ranger. Dragonzord. Austin St. John was the- Oh, guys, all our girlfriends and wives just broke

16:38.880 --> 16:45.760
up with us. Austin St. John is indeed the, um, is indeed the red ranger. Uh, if you were thinking

16:45.760 --> 16:51.600
of Googling him to see how he has aged, allow him to save you some time. He has, uh- He looks

16:51.600 --> 16:56.560
like, he looks like a young Dom Dolores and you need to get out. Didn't he do some grown folks

16:56.560 --> 17:05.680
pictures of the, uh, all male variety? I believe he was in some all male grown folks pictures.

17:05.680 --> 17:13.920
I may be imagining that though. Can we help this person diversify their tween dating portfolio?

17:16.320 --> 17:22.400
It's, see, it's dangerous because I have no way of verifying that this is a real 13 year old.

17:23.040 --> 17:26.320
I just assume anybody who says they're 13 on the internet is actually,

17:26.320 --> 17:34.800
you just go ahead and add 20 to that. Or subtract five. Oh. Yeah. So this is an eight year old

17:34.800 --> 17:40.000
trying to date up. There's what I'm saying. Okay. That's where the money is. Yeah. I assume that

17:40.000 --> 17:44.080
14 year old, I don't have any money. I'm assuming 14 year olds have all the money. Is that where

17:44.080 --> 17:50.240
it is all gone? Mm-hmm. You gotta get yourself a rich 14 year old. Yeah. They're pretty close

17:50.240 --> 17:56.720
to death anyway, so you'll inherit it. Mm-hmm. You, I guess Facebook, I guess this is why-

17:56.720 --> 18:03.200
Facebook is like the teen dating thing, right? Yeah. And by teen dating, you mean all dating,

18:03.200 --> 18:10.480
all ages, forever. All ages. And not just dating. All conversation and contact with human people

18:11.360 --> 18:17.600
is Facebook. Funerals. Funerals, Facebook funerals. Bar mitzvahs. Bury me. Like my casket.

18:19.680 --> 18:29.920
Click to throw dirt. Do you guys, how far are we from more traditional celebrations on Facebook?

18:29.920 --> 18:34.560
From like basically Wall-E where everybody is floating around in the chair staring at Facebook

18:34.560 --> 18:38.880
constantly? Yeah. Like how long until I can just get- I'm there. I do that. Get, go to a bris

18:38.880 --> 18:44.240
virtually. That, now this is largely not for convenience, but because I've never been to a bris

18:44.240 --> 18:48.800
and I can never seem to get invited. So fascination. Fascination. But I want to, I want- You want to

18:48.800 --> 18:54.240
live stream a bris. Let me Google your bris and live stream it from- Can I Google your bris is

18:54.240 --> 18:59.520
probably one of my favorite collections of words I've ever heard. Yeah. Let me you stream that bris

18:59.520 --> 19:05.680
please. Is your bris, sorry, is your, is your baby son's bris on Justin TV? Can you get that, can

19:06.800 --> 19:13.120
get the stream up? How's the wi-fi at the bris, bris facility? What is that? A church? Hospital?

19:13.120 --> 19:21.040
Or they do that? Uh, usually just a baseball, baseball field, baseball field. It's a, it's

19:21.040 --> 19:25.920
always themed. You know, you see a lot of rich families will rent out, you know, rent out Shea

19:25.920 --> 19:30.480
Stadium or something and it's like a- Yeah. You know. That's why when I have a kid- Put up a bunch

19:30.480 --> 19:35.760
of signs that says like, Tommy's bris is a home run and stuff like that. Oh, that's nice. Cut,

19:35.760 --> 19:43.360
cut the tip off your bat. Get that, get the cork out. Tommy. I don't think that's a thing. I don't

19:43.360 --> 19:48.640
think you know how brises work. Cut the end of your penis off, Tommy. Tip of your dick's gotta,

19:48.640 --> 19:57.360
the tip of your dick has to Jose Canseco. And also, uh, we have a guest bris guy, Jose Canseco.

19:57.360 --> 20:03.360
It's a noted baseballman. He's, he's done slicing through the air and knocking out homers,

20:03.360 --> 20:09.520
now he's going to slice through your wiener and knock out your foreskin. Jose Canseco's brother,

20:09.520 --> 20:15.120
Jerry, uh, is filling in for Jose Canseco. Do not make it. Because he is, he is a surgeon.

20:15.120 --> 20:24.160
Please be careful. It's my son's dick we're talking about. My coworker keeps peeking at

20:24.160 --> 20:28.400
the personal stuff I'm doing on my laptop. Whenever she comes to my cubicle for work-related

20:28.400 --> 20:35.840
stuff, what can I do to make her understand to mind her own business? P.S. You get a bonus of

20:35.840 --> 20:40.160
10 internet points if you can provide a solution that doesn't get me fired. Well, if you're gonna

20:40.160 --> 20:48.560
be picky, uh, this is from Worried in Colombia, South, South America. I gotta say, okay, don't,

20:49.840 --> 20:56.400
don't come to us and ask us for the favor of giving you advice and then hamstring us

20:58.400 --> 21:03.600
at the same time, you know? Right. It's like, hey, will you help me move? But you also have

21:03.600 --> 21:09.120
to wear these really constricting jorts. Think of it this way, Griffin, it's like in a video game

21:09.120 --> 21:14.400
where it's like, we need you to go in and steal this thing. Yeah. And you get an achievement if

21:14.400 --> 21:19.120
you don't kill everyone in the process. I guess. All right. So this is completely optional.

21:19.120 --> 21:22.160
Achievement. Now you're speaking my language.

21:25.600 --> 21:30.000
So this is sort of like, we'll start this question like the rock in the rundown,

21:30.000 --> 21:35.760
not using guns. And then if we get stuck, we will use guns. It just won't be as, as brainy.

21:35.760 --> 21:40.480
Sure. Um, so don't look at personal stuff while you're working.

21:40.480 --> 21:44.480
That's yeah. That's like work 101. If you want to do that,

21:44.480 --> 21:47.040
get a job writing about the video games from your house.

21:47.040 --> 21:51.200
I was gonna say, I don't think you guys are, are qualified to answer this question.

21:51.200 --> 21:54.000
Oh no. We are hypocrites from way back. I don't know.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.960
I was gonna say, you live your life looking at personal stuff on the internet.

21:56.960 --> 21:59.120
I don't accidentally write about video games.

21:59.120 --> 22:04.080
I, I, uh, I'd be more concerned about like my boss's school. That used to be tough when

22:04.080 --> 22:08.640
I would work at, when I worked at like offices, you're always worried about like how,

22:08.640 --> 22:13.280
what if the boss sees this, this doesn't look like I can't even pretend this is for work.

22:14.080 --> 22:16.720
It's two words. Alt tab.

22:16.720 --> 22:19.200
Alt tab. Now what does that mean?

22:19.200 --> 22:23.520
That's shady though. When you see, when you walk into somebody and you're like,

22:23.520 --> 22:26.880
is that a dick? And then it flickers really quickly.

22:26.880 --> 22:29.360
How personal do you think this is going?

22:30.160 --> 22:31.680
They're, they're live streaming a bris.

22:31.680 --> 22:35.440
I assumed it was like, I assumed it was like, they were looking at B dogs.

22:36.560 --> 22:41.120
Travis, no one except you looks at B dogs.

22:41.120 --> 22:42.480
R has ever looked at B dogs.

22:42.480 --> 22:45.760
I think in Columbia, B dogs is pretty big.

22:45.760 --> 22:49.520
When you say B dogs, no one knows what the fuck you're talking about.

22:49.520 --> 22:55.040
I think, I think you guys will find that many people know what I'm talking about.

22:55.040 --> 22:56.640
No one knows what B dogs are except you.

22:56.640 --> 22:59.360
I see that B dogs is a pretty big deal.

22:59.360 --> 23:02.640
I want to see how much higher you guys are.

23:02.640 --> 23:04.640
I'm going to tell you that no one knows what B dogs are.

23:06.080 --> 23:09.840
I think you'll find that B dogs are pretty popular.

23:09.840 --> 23:10.960
When do you bring up B dogs?

23:10.960 --> 23:13.040
It's like listening to Mariah Carey kibitz.

23:14.000 --> 23:15.360
When you bring up B dogs,

23:15.360 --> 23:18.240
it makes everybody sadder because they don't know what the fuck you're saying.

23:19.360 --> 23:20.560
And it's time for them to learn.

23:22.160 --> 23:24.160
Hey guys, I want to talk to you about B dogs.

23:24.160 --> 23:25.360
No, no, no.

23:25.360 --> 23:26.560
Fair enough. Fair enough.

23:26.560 --> 23:29.200
You're not using our show as a platform for spraying your madness.

23:30.000 --> 23:34.640
I've got something that might walk the line of fire firing.

23:34.640 --> 23:35.140
Okay.

23:37.520 --> 23:38.320
Blanket fort.

23:40.640 --> 23:43.840
Now listen, you got the cubicle and the cubicle seems like

23:44.880 --> 23:49.120
the perfect like chassis for a blanket fort, right?

23:49.120 --> 23:52.000
You really just have to have like the one blanket for a roof

23:52.000 --> 23:54.160
and then the one blanket for the entry way.

23:54.160 --> 23:58.080
And then all of a sudden you you're dealing with a blanket fort situation.

24:00.480 --> 24:03.440
Yeah, that doesn't seem like a big deal.

24:03.440 --> 24:05.600
Do you think the boss can come by and be like,

24:05.600 --> 24:08.240
hey, I'm going to need you to take this blanket fort down.

24:08.240 --> 24:09.440
Nobody's ever said that.

24:09.440 --> 24:13.360
I think unless you work at Pixar, it's not okay to build a blanket fort.

24:13.360 --> 24:14.480
Yes. Yeah.

24:14.480 --> 24:15.280
You know, the iPad.

24:15.280 --> 24:20.960
If you work at Pixar, it is no holds barred.

24:20.960 --> 24:21.760
Anything goes.

24:21.760 --> 24:22.960
Six year old stuff.

24:22.960 --> 24:24.320
Yeah.

24:24.320 --> 24:26.080
You want to ride a razor scooter around?

24:27.120 --> 24:28.880
Whenever you come in, you have to take your shoes off

24:28.880 --> 24:29.920
and put them in a cubby hole.

24:30.800 --> 24:31.200
Yeah.

24:31.200 --> 24:32.640
There's a ball pit in the corner.

24:33.520 --> 24:38.000
The only sin at Pixar is to not hang up the sign that says

24:38.000 --> 24:39.440
don't come in my blanket fort.

24:39.440 --> 24:40.960
I'm dreamagineering in here.

24:41.840 --> 24:43.120
I'm trying to make a wish.

24:43.120 --> 24:44.480
Dreamagineering.

24:44.480 --> 24:46.320
It's one step up from imagineering.

24:46.880 --> 24:48.800
That nothing good comes from imagineering anymore.

24:48.800 --> 24:49.760
No one has imagination.

24:49.760 --> 24:53.280
But dreamagineering is where you sort of half sleep,

24:54.480 --> 24:59.040
half read a comic book and just let your muse wander.

24:59.040 --> 25:00.960
You smoke like half a bowl of salvia.

25:00.960 --> 25:04.560
Half a bowl of salvia and then just head to the streets of inspiration.

25:04.560 --> 25:06.240
And you're like, oh, talking cars.

25:06.240 --> 25:06.480
Yeah.

25:08.880 --> 25:10.320
And then you make Cars 3.

25:10.320 --> 25:12.240
This coyote is screaming at me.

25:12.240 --> 25:13.440
No, we can't use that one.

25:13.440 --> 25:14.720
But keep dreamagineering.

25:16.000 --> 25:17.120
You'll find it.

25:17.120 --> 25:20.080
And then I watched As a Bear Ate the Placenta.

25:20.080 --> 25:21.600
No, that's not a good Pixar movie.

25:21.600 --> 25:22.800
That's a bad one, actually.

25:22.800 --> 25:23.360
That's a bad Pixar movie.

25:23.360 --> 25:24.480
Placenta can talk?

25:25.440 --> 25:26.000
Let's think about it.

25:26.000 --> 25:26.640
I like it.

25:26.640 --> 25:27.760
Can we get Buscemi?

25:27.760 --> 25:30.080
Can we sign Buscemi on as talking placenta?

25:31.120 --> 25:34.880
Can we get Ryan Phillippe into the studio to play the bear that eats the placenta?

25:35.760 --> 25:36.960
That could be a good movie.

25:36.960 --> 25:37.920
I would watch that movie.

25:37.920 --> 25:39.120
That's what Brave's about.

25:39.680 --> 25:42.640
And you could just call that movie The Bear That Ate the Placenta.

25:43.200 --> 25:44.880
It's very descriptive.

25:44.880 --> 25:45.680
And it's catchy.

25:45.680 --> 25:47.200
Here's the thing, though.

25:48.400 --> 25:50.800
It's gotta be 3D.

25:50.800 --> 25:51.760
Gotta be 3D.

25:51.760 --> 25:56.720
When the bear tears into the placenta and shakes it out of his matted fur,

25:56.720 --> 26:00.080
I want that placenta to just come soaring into the audience.

26:00.080 --> 26:04.720
Because I think it's about time kids learn what placenta is.

26:04.720 --> 26:08.480
Yeah, I think that we could actually make it in 4D and have it reach back through time.

26:09.200 --> 26:10.080
That's appropriate.

26:12.320 --> 26:15.120
That's the kind of dreamagineering that you come up with at Pixar.

26:15.120 --> 26:16.000
Time travel.

26:16.000 --> 26:16.720
Time travel.

26:16.720 --> 26:17.360
Right.

26:17.360 --> 26:19.360
We all used to be placenta, you know?

26:19.360 --> 26:21.120
Why not go back and remind ourselves?

26:21.120 --> 26:22.480
I don't think that's how it works.

26:23.840 --> 26:26.880
I don't think you're made of placenta at any point.

26:26.880 --> 26:30.000
I have to admit to you, Travis, that when you said 4D,

26:30.640 --> 26:33.600
I automatically assumed that you were just going to launch

26:34.240 --> 26:36.720
chunks of placenta at the children in the audience.

26:38.080 --> 26:40.640
I understood that is what 4D meant.

26:40.640 --> 26:42.960
I thought 4D was smell-o-vision.

26:42.960 --> 26:43.520
Yeah, well...

26:43.520 --> 26:46.320
Can we bring back scents around?

26:46.320 --> 26:47.440
Yeah, I'm sorry, Travis.

26:47.440 --> 26:49.840
Do you think you're going to get chunks of placenta launched at you

26:49.840 --> 26:51.280
and you're not going to smell them?

26:52.720 --> 26:53.120
How fresh is this?

26:53.120 --> 26:56.240
I would love to see a movie in which they do it in 4D

26:56.800 --> 26:59.440
but they remove smell from the equation.

26:59.440 --> 27:02.320
Like, put on these glasses and also this noseflip.

27:02.320 --> 27:06.160
Why am I going to waste fresh placenta

27:06.160 --> 27:10.560
when I could be selling that to Tyra Banks for pennies,

27:10.560 --> 27:12.720
for, you know, hundreds of thousands of dollars?

27:12.720 --> 27:15.760
I'm going to use old placenta when I chuck it at the kids.

27:16.400 --> 27:16.640
Huh?

27:17.520 --> 27:17.920
Sorry, guys.

27:17.920 --> 27:18.720
The FCC is here.

27:18.720 --> 27:21.840
They say that we've said placenta way too many times in this episode.

27:21.840 --> 27:23.440
The man's shutting us down.

27:23.440 --> 27:25.600
Now we have to change it to schmutzenta.

27:27.840 --> 27:31.280
Now we got to change it to baby lube.

27:32.880 --> 27:33.360
This is easy.

27:33.360 --> 27:36.480
We change placenta, cat, bear to a dog, Milo notice 2.

27:38.480 --> 27:40.720
I'm going to the bank in 3D.

27:40.720 --> 27:42.960
Oh my god, his whiskers.

27:42.960 --> 27:43.760
Those dogs are...

27:43.760 --> 27:45.760
I bet all the animals in that movie are dead.

27:45.760 --> 27:46.560
Every animal.

27:46.560 --> 27:48.560
Oh, Homeward Bound, it's all dead.

27:48.560 --> 27:49.360
All dead.

27:49.360 --> 27:50.320
All dead.

27:50.320 --> 27:51.280
Shadow went first.

27:51.280 --> 27:52.240
You know it.

27:52.240 --> 27:53.680
You know Shadow went first.

27:54.240 --> 27:55.440
Also, look who's talking.

27:55.440 --> 27:56.400
That baby's dead.

27:56.400 --> 27:56.960
Yeah.

27:56.960 --> 27:59.120
If Homeward Bound, The Incredible Journey,

27:59.120 --> 28:02.320
the movie where dogs go across country to find their owners,

28:02.320 --> 28:04.320
if that movie would play five minutes later,

28:04.320 --> 28:06.800
you would just see the dogs having heart attacks and die

28:06.800 --> 28:07.920
because they went so far.

28:07.920 --> 28:10.560
You know, I actually know that that movie is a work of fiction,

28:10.560 --> 28:12.080
not just because the dogs talk,

28:12.080 --> 28:14.160
but because at no point does one of them roll over

28:14.160 --> 28:15.200
and show you his boner.

28:16.160 --> 28:19.760
You know, Homeward Bound, what they don't show you

28:19.760 --> 28:22.880
is the next, like, five or ten years living with those animals

28:22.880 --> 28:24.880
is going to be insufferable.

28:24.880 --> 28:25.360
Yeah.

28:25.360 --> 28:27.200
You know, you throw the stick and...

28:27.200 --> 28:28.000
Let's go for a walk.

28:28.000 --> 28:29.600
I don't really feel like going for a walk.

28:29.600 --> 28:30.080
Oh, really?

28:30.080 --> 28:33.120
Because you fucking left me in San Francisco, you cunt.

28:33.120 --> 28:34.160
You remember?

28:34.160 --> 28:36.160
You fucking piece of shit.

28:36.160 --> 28:38.080
Oh, you want me to go fetch?

28:38.080 --> 28:39.920
Yeah, I don't think I'm going to

28:39.920 --> 28:43.280
because I fetched you from across the country.

28:43.280 --> 28:44.000
So I'm cool.

28:44.000 --> 28:45.920
I'm fetching forever.

28:45.920 --> 28:47.600
Were you going to eat all that turkey?

28:47.600 --> 28:48.560
I didn't think so.

28:50.400 --> 28:51.920
Give me the rest of your turkey.

28:51.920 --> 28:54.720
So guys, do you think that there is a website

28:54.720 --> 28:57.440
that this person could go to that would not get them fired,

28:58.160 --> 29:00.640
but would also teach their coworker a lesson

29:00.640 --> 29:02.560
about looking over someone's shoulder?

29:02.560 --> 29:03.680
Ooh, yeah.

29:03.680 --> 29:04.640
Oh, yeah.

29:04.640 --> 29:08.720
Oh, yeah, like pipe bomb stuff.

29:08.720 --> 29:09.440
No.

29:09.440 --> 29:10.000
No?

29:10.000 --> 29:10.960
No, fired.

29:10.960 --> 29:11.680
Fired.

29:11.680 --> 29:12.160
Fired.

29:12.160 --> 29:12.720
That's fired.

29:13.600 --> 29:14.960
Because I immediately went to something

29:14.960 --> 29:17.360
that was titled like how to eat your coworker

29:17.360 --> 29:19.040
but I think that would get you fired.

29:19.040 --> 29:19.840
Sword polishing.

29:22.480 --> 29:22.800
Okay.

29:24.320 --> 29:26.320
I think the whole internet is so weird now.

29:26.320 --> 29:30.320
It's hard to think of something that's not really broken down.

29:30.320 --> 29:34.720
You could get on a dating site for 13-year-olds.

29:34.720 --> 29:37.360
Yeah, we didn't actually come up with a good name for that.

29:37.360 --> 29:40.480
Do you guys have, like, Teenster sounds pretty good,

29:40.480 --> 29:43.360
but I'm not sure that's working.

29:43.360 --> 29:44.400
Let's mull it over.

29:44.400 --> 29:45.040
Teen love.

29:45.040 --> 29:46.080
Teen zone for kids.

29:46.080 --> 29:47.040
Teen zone for kids.

29:47.760 --> 29:53.120
Teen zone for kids and fake kids that are uncles, actually.

29:53.120 --> 29:54.000
Secretly uncles.

29:54.000 --> 29:56.640
You know, there's a pen and teller book,

29:56.640 --> 29:57.760
and I can't remember what it's,

29:57.760 --> 30:00.160
it's how to mess with your friends.

30:00.160 --> 30:00.640
Is that it?

30:01.200 --> 30:01.840
I don't remember.

30:01.840 --> 30:02.560
I don't know.

30:02.560 --> 30:05.120
But at one point, they talk about being on a train or plane

30:05.120 --> 30:06.480
and somebody reading over your shoulder

30:07.280 --> 30:12.160
and type out onto like a Word document.

30:12.160 --> 30:13.600
Like, I know that you're reading this.

30:14.400 --> 30:15.360
I know I can see you.

30:15.360 --> 30:16.800
We're looking over my shoulder.

30:16.800 --> 30:17.760
Oh, that's pretty good.

30:17.760 --> 30:21.120
Actually, write a note to that person

30:21.120 --> 30:22.800
and then make them feel bad when they scope it.

30:23.760 --> 30:24.880
There's nothing.

30:24.880 --> 30:25.680
Here's the problem, though.

30:25.680 --> 30:28.720
There's nothing that you can do on your computer

30:28.720 --> 30:30.720
that you shouldn't be doing at work

30:30.720 --> 30:35.520
that won't be so like incredibly scintillating

30:35.520 --> 30:38.160
that this person won't redouble their efforts

30:38.160 --> 30:39.600
to peep your business.

30:39.600 --> 30:40.000
Right.

30:40.000 --> 30:41.360
Oh, you know what it is?

30:41.360 --> 30:42.080
Here's what you do.

30:42.720 --> 30:44.400
Have your personal website or whatever,

30:44.400 --> 30:45.440
whatever you're checking out,

30:45.440 --> 30:47.920
and then when they come in, close it real quick.

30:47.920 --> 30:51.120
But your background is just a collage of pictures of them.

30:52.320 --> 30:52.880
That's it.

30:53.440 --> 30:55.040
That's circle gets the square.

30:55.040 --> 30:56.400
Circle gets the square.

30:56.400 --> 30:58.080
Travis has finally helped somebody.

30:58.080 --> 31:00.640
It only took us 102 episodes, but we did it.

31:01.360 --> 31:02.880
Someone has been helped.

31:02.880 --> 31:04.000
Guys, do you want a Yahoo?

31:04.640 --> 31:04.880
Yeah.

31:04.880 --> 31:05.440
Yeah.

31:05.440 --> 31:07.920
This Yahoo is sent in by Malik Marcellus.

31:07.920 --> 31:08.560
Thank you, Malik.

31:08.560 --> 31:10.320
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

31:11.760 --> 31:12.480
Yeah, baby.

31:12.480 --> 31:12.800
Yeah.

31:14.480 --> 31:15.040
No.

31:15.040 --> 31:16.960
Justin, could you say that correctly, please?

31:18.400 --> 31:19.840
Yeah, baby.

31:19.840 --> 31:20.340
Yeah.

31:21.040 --> 31:21.920
Thank you.

31:21.920 --> 31:29.440
Who fucking asks, what themed party can I have for Halloween?

31:29.440 --> 31:32.160
I want to attract lots of lovely ladies.

31:32.160 --> 31:33.040
Oh, behave.

31:34.000 --> 31:34.880
Oh, no.

31:34.880 --> 31:35.760
All right, Griffin.

31:35.760 --> 31:38.560
I'm going to have to take this question away from you.

31:38.560 --> 31:38.880
OK.

31:39.440 --> 31:42.960
Can you please paste the text into our Skype window?

31:44.560 --> 31:46.240
OK, you just typed, fuck you.

31:46.240 --> 31:50.160
That is enough.

31:54.800 --> 31:58.320
What themed party can I have for Halloween?

31:59.120 --> 32:02.640
I want to attract lots of lovely ladies.

32:02.640 --> 32:04.160
Oh, behave.

32:04.960 --> 32:05.920
That is her fault.

32:05.920 --> 32:08.000
It sounds like Austin Powers had a stroke.

32:08.720 --> 32:09.280
I did.

32:12.080 --> 32:13.280
This isn't my fault.

32:13.280 --> 32:17.120
It's Mike Myers' fault for not releasing a new Austin Powers movie.

32:17.120 --> 32:17.680
I don't know what he sounds like.

32:17.680 --> 32:21.120
It sounds like your face is melting while you're doing it.

32:21.120 --> 32:23.440
It's like Austin Powers had a bucket of water.

32:23.440 --> 32:26.240
I got a gram, call him baby, boy.

32:26.240 --> 32:28.480
I got a Haruka now.

32:28.480 --> 32:30.320
Now I can't take your body.

32:30.320 --> 32:32.160
Oh, you can't baby, yeah.

32:36.800 --> 32:40.800
Every day alone, I feel great Elvis Costello.

32:40.800 --> 32:45.120
It sounds like if Austin Powers were a fat woman on South Park.

32:45.920 --> 32:48.080
That's the sound I apparently was.

32:48.080 --> 32:48.400
Yeah.

32:53.280 --> 32:54.960
Oh, behave.

32:54.960 --> 32:58.320
OK, I think this guy say something.

32:58.320 --> 33:01.440
I think this person has their heart set on a theme.

33:02.640 --> 33:05.440
I think the theme has been decided.

33:05.440 --> 33:08.960
Guys, I don't want to get outside of the question,

33:08.960 --> 33:11.280
but is it possible that this person has just chosen

33:11.280 --> 33:13.040
to live an Austin Powers lifestyle?

33:16.560 --> 33:18.480
Can I share the top answer?

33:20.640 --> 33:25.200
The top answer from Yahoo Answers user Rock Titan says,

33:27.440 --> 33:28.320
it's April.

33:28.320 --> 33:38.480
Oh, he's the pragmatist.

33:38.480 --> 33:39.360
Oh, that's great.

33:45.920 --> 33:48.720
Any Halloween themed party?

33:49.840 --> 33:54.240
The harder thing to think of is a Halloween themed party

33:54.240 --> 33:59.760
that women somehow won't find a way to make sexy.

33:59.760 --> 34:03.040
Is that too much?

34:03.680 --> 34:04.400
What are you saying?

34:05.920 --> 34:06.640
I'm saying that-

34:08.080 --> 34:10.960
So you're saying like a Captain Pike themed party

34:10.960 --> 34:12.800
where everybody rolls up in a big container.

34:13.360 --> 34:15.040
Maybe this is, I don't know.

34:15.760 --> 34:19.440
Maybe this isn't true anymore since none of us are in college.

34:19.440 --> 34:25.280
But I feel like in college, if you had any Halloween party,

34:25.840 --> 34:28.000
there would be at least one to two women there

34:29.760 --> 34:33.680
who were dressed up in a scintillating way.

34:37.600 --> 34:40.160
Hey, are you in college right now?

34:42.640 --> 34:44.320
Can you not listen to podcasts?

34:44.880 --> 34:48.160
I promise you, there will be lots of time for us.

34:48.160 --> 34:50.560
We'll still be here when you're 31 years old.

34:51.600 --> 34:55.200
Don't waste your college years listening to us, please.

34:55.200 --> 34:56.720
Indoor us away in a vault,

34:56.720 --> 34:59.040
and then when there's some kind of apocalypse

34:59.040 --> 35:00.560
and everyone else in the world is killed,

35:00.560 --> 35:01.920
there will be time then.

35:01.920 --> 35:03.120
There will be time for that.

35:03.120 --> 35:05.360
If you have listened to every episode,

35:05.360 --> 35:09.280
that's like five entire days that you could have spent-

35:10.640 --> 35:11.360
Getting it.

35:11.360 --> 35:11.860
Who knows?

35:12.800 --> 35:13.680
Just getting it.

35:15.120 --> 35:16.000
Man, woman?

35:16.000 --> 35:17.360
It's a good time to check in.

35:17.360 --> 35:19.760
It's been a solid five months now.

35:19.760 --> 35:23.360
We're, you know, we're a good way into 2012.

35:23.920 --> 35:24.880
Are you guys getting it?

35:25.680 --> 35:28.720
Like, are you in college and listening to a podcast right now?

35:28.720 --> 35:30.480
Unless you're getting a mani-pedi

35:30.480 --> 35:32.800
and are getting ready to go out and get it.

35:32.800 --> 35:35.120
Like, I don't- I can't think of a good reason

35:35.120 --> 35:37.280
to be listening to this show right now if you're in college.

35:37.920 --> 35:39.120
It's a fucking owl!

35:39.120 --> 35:42.240
Think about that one thing that you want to do,

35:43.040 --> 35:44.160
but you're too afraid to do,

35:44.160 --> 35:45.280
but you're too afraid to do.

35:46.080 --> 35:50.400
Hit the pause button and just go fucking get that thing.

35:50.400 --> 35:51.360
Get it.

35:51.360 --> 35:52.720
Get whatever it is.

35:52.720 --> 35:54.080
You guys have just blown my mind

35:54.080 --> 35:58.400
because there is probably a pretty solid group

35:58.400 --> 36:02.080
of our listeners that have one month of college left.

36:02.080 --> 36:03.600
Oh my god!

36:03.600 --> 36:05.440
They will graduate at the end of May.

36:06.240 --> 36:08.720
Never to- never to be in school again.

36:09.920 --> 36:10.640
This is it.

36:10.640 --> 36:15.040
My last month of college was the best month of school time

36:15.040 --> 36:16.880
that I ever had in my entire life.

36:16.880 --> 36:19.520
And if you are not- if you are not dipping-

36:19.520 --> 36:23.440
you're- you're just drunk on, well, pabs.

36:24.640 --> 36:26.080
But you're also drunk on, like,

36:27.040 --> 36:29.440
fear of what's going to happen once you get out of school.

36:29.440 --> 36:30.960
You're drunk on, like, excitement

36:30.960 --> 36:33.120
that you're about to be finished with college.

36:33.120 --> 36:35.600
You're- you're just- you're drunk on power

36:35.600 --> 36:36.720
because you're the highest.

36:36.720 --> 36:37.600
You're the highest.

36:37.600 --> 36:41.520
Hey, if you're a little nervous about leaving, don't.

36:42.160 --> 36:42.560
I treated-

36:42.560 --> 36:43.760
Van Wilde that shit.

36:43.760 --> 36:46.800
I treated myself through year five and I don't regret it.

36:48.720 --> 36:49.360
Well.

36:49.360 --> 36:49.760
You know what?

36:49.760 --> 36:52.160
You guys know why I had to take a fifth year of college?

36:53.680 --> 36:54.880
Because I failed Spanish.

36:56.320 --> 36:57.360
I never knew that.

36:57.360 --> 36:58.320
I thought you just, like-

36:59.200 --> 36:59.680
I thought it was-

36:59.680 --> 37:00.720
I thought it was a choice.

37:00.720 --> 37:02.800
I thought it was because you wanted to change your major.

37:02.800 --> 37:04.800
No, I failed Spanish.

37:04.800 --> 37:06.320
Shh.

37:06.320 --> 37:08.640
Okay, so don't- don't rage that hard.

37:10.000 --> 37:11.600
I raged so hard I forgot my sign language.

37:11.600 --> 37:13.680
Hey, do you know why I failed Spanish?

37:13.680 --> 37:15.360
Because I walked into the class

37:15.360 --> 37:17.600
and the motherfucker is speaking Spanish.

37:17.600 --> 37:19.600
Dog, I don't speak it.

37:19.600 --> 37:21.680
I know this is the fourth one of these I've had.

37:21.680 --> 37:23.440
Like, I don't speak this language.

37:23.440 --> 37:24.400
Can you please?

37:24.400 --> 37:26.720
He would make assignments in Spanish.

37:26.720 --> 37:29.200
I don't even know what that work was.

37:29.840 --> 37:32.880
You would show up with a picture of your family

37:32.880 --> 37:34.320
you had drawn in red crayon,

37:34.320 --> 37:35.440
like, is this- is this it?

37:35.440 --> 37:37.120
Is this what you wanted?

37:37.120 --> 37:37.680
Is this it?

37:39.120 --> 37:40.880
I baked empanadas.

37:40.880 --> 37:42.320
Is that what you wanted?

37:42.320 --> 37:43.840
Did you want this?

37:43.840 --> 37:46.000
Did you want these empanadas?

37:46.000 --> 37:47.280
This is what I made for you.

37:47.280 --> 37:48.880
Say that again, please.

37:48.880 --> 37:49.840
Empanadas.

37:51.840 --> 37:55.360
Start to sound like Marlee Matlin taking a Spanish class.

37:55.360 --> 37:56.480
Justin is either-

37:57.520 --> 38:01.520
He has an aphasia or he's having a stroke in real life, IRL.

38:01.520 --> 38:04.960
Empanadas, empanadas.

38:04.960 --> 38:05.760
Okay.

38:05.760 --> 38:07.120
Nope, your tongue is melting.

38:07.120 --> 38:08.000
Get to the hospital.

38:08.640 --> 38:10.000
Time loss is brain loss.

38:10.000 --> 38:11.360
I got time-illitis.

38:14.720 --> 38:15.040
Let's-

38:16.320 --> 38:17.200
Can I take it to the bridge?

38:18.640 --> 38:19.440
Yeah, take it to the bridge.

38:19.440 --> 38:20.320
Can I take it to the bridge?

38:21.040 --> 38:21.280
Yeah.

38:21.280 --> 38:41.840
Guys, this is an exciting time for my brother and my brother and me, busy, busy time, so

38:41.840 --> 38:46.160
many people to say that we're thinking about them and other people are thinking about them.

38:46.160 --> 38:50.560
I would like Griffin to tell me about this first- first group.

38:50.560 --> 38:54.800
This first message is from Alex and Kate for their good friend, Dan Kober.

38:54.800 --> 38:56.160
Happy birthday, Dan Kober.

38:56.720 --> 38:58.320
They have been friends with Dan Kober.

38:58.320 --> 39:00.640
God, I hope I'm saying that name right since I'm saying it a lot.

39:01.360 --> 39:02.720
They've been friends for over 10 years.

39:02.720 --> 39:07.440
They met in 10th grade chemistry and Alex was the best man at Dan's wedding.

39:08.800 --> 39:12.080
He and his lovely wife, Shannon, live in Grove City, Ohio.

39:12.080 --> 39:13.600
They have a shit ton of cats.

39:14.480 --> 39:15.760
He likes home brewing.

39:15.760 --> 39:19.680
He likes video games and a computer engineer, so he sounds like a neat guy.

39:19.680 --> 39:22.480
I mean, Griffin, it says four cats.

39:22.480 --> 39:24.080
You know what you're making sound like?

39:24.080 --> 39:25.360
He has the most cats.

39:25.360 --> 39:29.360
There's a possibility that he will die and his body won't be discovered for five days

39:29.360 --> 39:31.360
and he'll be partially consumed by all of his cats.

39:31.360 --> 39:32.720
If you have one cat, that's cool.

39:32.720 --> 39:36.640
If you have two cats, they better do like tandem tricks.

39:36.640 --> 39:39.440
Any more than that, it's a metric shit time.

39:40.960 --> 39:43.920
Anyway, happy birthday to you, Dan Kober.

39:43.920 --> 39:45.440
I'm not judging your number of cats.

39:45.440 --> 39:46.400
Fill your life with love.

39:47.200 --> 39:48.000
Measure it in love.

39:48.000 --> 39:50.800
Seasons of cats of love.

39:53.360 --> 40:02.080
Guys, in the spirit of 20 Does, our next advertiser quit their job, packed their bags,

40:02.080 --> 40:07.280
moved away from Seattle and applied to grad school, then spent a month making his first

40:07.280 --> 40:09.360
iOS game, Singing Star.

40:10.000 --> 40:14.560
The idea is that you travel through space seeding barren plants with life using musical

40:14.560 --> 40:21.520
shooting stars, which is basically what Cher has been doing for three decades in a metaphysical

40:21.520 --> 40:22.240
sense.

40:22.240 --> 40:24.880
No, in the literal body of a spaceship.

40:25.680 --> 40:26.720
Cher has a spaceship.

40:26.720 --> 40:29.360
I did the art programming and sound design, everything.

40:29.360 --> 40:34.320
He's not a pro game developer, so maybe Travis could review it since he's not a pro either.

40:34.320 --> 40:40.240
So search for Singing Star in the app store and download it and let everybody know that

40:40.240 --> 40:41.120
I'm going to get it right now.

40:41.120 --> 40:45.680
Now, if you go impregnate, impregnate some planets.

40:45.680 --> 40:48.160
I think that's impregnating planets, basically.

40:48.880 --> 40:50.080
Here's another one.

40:50.080 --> 40:55.280
This one was sent in by Peter McCaffrey for his dear wife, Megan McCaffrey.

40:56.640 --> 41:02.960
He says that he wants to wish his wife, Megan, good luck delivering their third child on

41:02.960 --> 41:03.680
May 29th.

41:04.400 --> 41:05.280
She's 20.

41:05.280 --> 41:06.560
She's 25 years young.

41:06.560 --> 41:07.440
She's getting it done.

41:07.440 --> 41:13.200
She is a saint, and all women would be so lucky to be like you, and I am a lucky so-and-so

41:13.200 --> 41:14.240
to be with you.

41:14.240 --> 41:15.440
Keep getting it, honey.

41:15.440 --> 41:16.320
20 does.

41:16.320 --> 41:16.960
Get it.

41:16.960 --> 41:18.160
Just effing get it.

41:20.320 --> 41:21.600
I like this guy.

41:21.600 --> 41:22.480
He really goes on a tear there.

41:23.200 --> 41:23.600
Yeah.

41:23.600 --> 41:26.480
I also think this would be the most amazing Lamaze class.

41:26.480 --> 41:26.880
Yeah.

41:26.880 --> 41:27.600
Go.

41:27.600 --> 41:28.000
Get it.

41:28.000 --> 41:28.240
Get it.

41:28.240 --> 41:29.040
Fucking dig deep.

41:30.400 --> 41:30.960
20 does.

41:30.960 --> 41:35.520
I think that this is actually Bob Harper from The Biggest Loser, and he's just like, tear

41:35.520 --> 41:36.000
it up.

41:36.000 --> 41:37.040
You can do this.

41:37.040 --> 41:37.520
Get it.

41:37.520 --> 41:38.480
That is.

41:38.480 --> 41:39.680
You guys know Bob Harper?

41:40.560 --> 41:42.000
Please don't be ridiculous.

41:42.000 --> 41:42.960
What are you talking about?

41:42.960 --> 41:44.240
What the fuck are you talking about?

41:45.040 --> 41:49.280
He's the man on my workout DVDs, and he's like, reach deep down inside yourself.

41:49.280 --> 41:50.080
Find your soul.

41:50.080 --> 41:50.640
Rip it out.

41:50.640 --> 41:52.000
Griffin, can I ask you this?

41:52.000 --> 41:52.720
Use its power.

41:52.720 --> 41:53.760
Eat the placenta.

41:53.760 --> 41:55.600
Has there ever been a moment before that has worked on you?

41:55.600 --> 41:58.720
And ironically, please be honest, this is for posterity.

41:58.720 --> 42:02.400
No, well, it makes me angry at Bob Harper, which is my own source of energy.

42:03.440 --> 42:10.560
When I'm working out on his expert edition workout, I am fueled by a small son of hatred

42:10.560 --> 42:12.160
for Bob Harper that I keep inside me.

42:12.160 --> 42:16.800
Megan, maybe if you can focus on a small sphere of hatred for Bob Harper, you can get through

42:16.800 --> 42:17.760
this pregnancy.

42:17.760 --> 42:19.600
Congratulations to you and Peter.

42:19.600 --> 42:23.120
Travis, we have, let's all go to the movies.

42:23.120 --> 42:24.480
Let's all go to the movies.

42:24.480 --> 42:26.240
Let's all go to the movies.

42:26.240 --> 42:31.360
Let's all go to the movies and hear some guys talk about stuff.

42:31.360 --> 42:33.840
Well, have you guys checked out cinemabums.com?

42:33.840 --> 42:35.040
I love cinnamon buns.

42:35.600 --> 42:37.760
No, no, cinemabums.

42:39.120 --> 42:40.480
Travis, you're saying it?

42:40.480 --> 42:42.240
I'm just hearing cinnamon buns and I'm-

42:42.240 --> 42:43.760
No, cinemabums.

42:43.760 --> 42:44.260
Okay.

42:45.920 --> 42:47.600
I think they make cinnamon buns.

42:47.600 --> 42:52.320
It sounds like if a little kid tried to say cinnamon buns.

42:52.320 --> 42:53.200
It's adorable, Travis.

42:53.200 --> 42:56.480
I just ate a bunch of peanut butter and I want to talk about cinnamon buns.

42:56.480 --> 43:00.480
Pretending you're one of the characters in Family Circus and it's adorable.

43:01.600 --> 43:05.200
If you follow my footsteps back, you can get the cinemabum stuff.

43:05.200 --> 43:07.920
Now I can't even say it right, you assholes.

43:07.920 --> 43:09.920
Jeffy eat it all the cinemabums.

43:11.040 --> 43:13.440
cinemabums.com, Travis, what is it?

43:14.240 --> 43:15.520
I don't even want to talk about it now.

43:15.520 --> 43:16.400
You guys have made me so conscious.

43:16.400 --> 43:17.040
Well, you have to.

43:17.040 --> 43:17.680
They paid us.

43:20.720 --> 43:22.000
It's a great webcomic.

43:22.000 --> 43:29.760
It comes out every Monday and Thursday and it's funny takes on movies and they talk about

43:29.760 --> 43:32.400
movies that are coming out now and just cinema in general.

43:33.920 --> 43:41.280
I'm sure that will appeal to the perplexingly gigantic webcomic audience that we have.

43:42.400 --> 43:43.440
It's got its own style.

43:43.440 --> 43:45.840
It's a distinctive style, which I appreciate.

43:46.720 --> 43:48.480
They're not trying to blend in here.

43:48.480 --> 43:53.040
And I'm I read some of these before we started and I got a big kick out of it.

43:53.040 --> 43:57.120
cinemabums.com is the name of the site.

43:57.120 --> 44:00.320
You can go and read the webcomic and enjoy it.

44:02.880 --> 44:03.840
We would recommend it.

44:03.840 --> 44:06.720
Go go on updated Mondays and Thursdays.

44:06.720 --> 44:08.320
So there's a new one right now.

44:08.320 --> 44:19.760
Do you guys have any ideas of how to weave these fucking two things together?

44:24.000 --> 44:24.720
Nope.

44:24.720 --> 44:25.040
Great.

44:25.040 --> 44:25.360
Thanks.

44:25.360 --> 44:26.480
You're very, very helpful.

44:28.480 --> 44:30.640
Hey, what's that smell?

44:31.600 --> 44:33.680
I think that it's cinnamon buns.

44:33.680 --> 44:40.960
You tell me it's not, but I'm a grown adult.

44:40.960 --> 44:43.280
You say it is cinema bums.

44:43.280 --> 44:44.560
I said, that's what I said.

44:45.440 --> 44:48.720
Then you say it's a webcomic and you can't eat those.

44:48.720 --> 44:49.920
I say, watch me.

44:54.000 --> 44:58.480
So I eat the webcomic and I get real sick.

44:58.480 --> 45:00.560
I have to go to the hospital for a week.

45:00.560 --> 45:05.760
And while I'm there, you say, Hey, I know how to occupy your dilated filled hours.

45:06.800 --> 45:08.720
It's an app called singing star.

45:08.720 --> 45:10.960
And so I get it and enjoy it.

45:12.320 --> 45:13.200
There it is.

45:13.760 --> 45:14.800
Threaded the needle.

45:15.440 --> 45:18.160
No, like Josh didn't read his hay day.

45:18.160 --> 45:20.400
Hello, fake radio listeners.

45:20.400 --> 45:22.000
I didn't see you over there.

45:22.000 --> 45:25.360
This is judge John Hodgman relaxing in his chambers.

45:25.360 --> 45:29.440
You know, I've resolved the greatest moral conflicts of our time, like the potluck problem.

45:29.440 --> 45:31.760
Snob versus slob.

45:31.760 --> 45:33.760
And of course the toot dispute.

45:33.760 --> 45:37.280
Do you have a pressing issue that needs swift, decisive justice?

45:37.280 --> 45:46.560
Visit us at www.maximumfun.org slash J J H O that's JJ Ho for judge John Hodgman.

45:46.560 --> 45:49.920
And here are the results of each case on my weekly podcast.

45:49.920 --> 45:51.120
Judge John Hodgman.

45:51.120 --> 45:56.240
You can subscribe in iTunes or find it online at maximum fun.org.

45:56.240 --> 45:57.600
This is the sound of a gavel.

45:57.600 --> 45:59.200
That is all.

45:59.920 --> 46:03.520
This question comes to us from, well, I'll tell you at the end.

46:03.520 --> 46:07.040
Many of your letters are about how to deal with unintentionally douchey family,

46:07.040 --> 46:11.120
friends and acquaintances who I think probably just got comfortable with their surroundings

46:11.120 --> 46:12.640
and slid into doucheyness.

46:12.640 --> 46:15.840
How can we police ourselves so we don't make such a slide?

46:15.840 --> 46:18.160
That's from moderately comfortable in the Midwest.

46:19.360 --> 46:21.200
You got to, you got to surround yourself.

46:21.200 --> 46:22.720
You can't, you can't police yourself.

46:22.720 --> 46:26.480
I don't think you got to surround yourself with douche.

46:26.480 --> 46:31.440
Slithmus tests that you can, that you can all, you can police them.

46:31.440 --> 46:32.960
It's like a circle of trust, you know?

46:33.760 --> 46:35.040
Ooh, I like that.

46:35.040 --> 46:36.400
A circle of accountability.

46:37.440 --> 46:38.880
Jack, can you scoot a little closer to your mic?

46:38.880 --> 46:40.080
I hear quite an echo.

46:40.080 --> 46:40.640
Yes.

46:40.640 --> 46:40.960
Thank you.

46:40.960 --> 46:41.280
Sorry.

46:45.520 --> 46:51.200
Um, you gotta, you gotta, fuck, record every conversation that you have.

46:52.560 --> 46:53.360
And then like go.

46:53.360 --> 46:54.480
Hire a stenographer.

46:54.480 --> 46:58.080
Well, you don't have to go that far, but you can just like listen to every conversation

46:58.080 --> 46:59.200
that you have that you've recorded.

46:59.200 --> 47:02.560
I think you should hire a stenographer because here's my thing.

47:02.560 --> 47:05.840
You can create a job and that's what this economy needs.

47:05.840 --> 47:06.160
Thanks.

47:07.120 --> 47:08.160
You're right, Travis.

47:08.160 --> 47:11.760
Thank you, Travis, for thinking about our economy when the government's so selfish.

47:12.320 --> 47:12.800
Thank you.

47:12.800 --> 47:16.720
And then hire a stenographer for your stenographer, a tinier stenographer.

47:16.720 --> 47:20.240
I actually think that if you have a stenographer writing down all your stuff,

47:20.240 --> 47:23.600
you're going to say cooler stuff because you're going to know there's that,

47:23.600 --> 47:25.280
there's that accountability there.

47:25.280 --> 47:27.440
And you get to yell stuff out, like read that back to me.

47:28.240 --> 47:29.600
Can I get a copy of that?

47:29.600 --> 47:34.560
No, actually, Vicki, you can see here what I said was that I will do the laundry when

47:34.560 --> 47:38.320
I get some time, as you see here.

47:38.320 --> 47:40.080
That would be actually really good for marriage.

47:40.080 --> 47:43.680
If you can get a marriage stenographer, it would be hugely helpful.

47:43.680 --> 47:45.840
And I sound like I'm about to go on a Tom Pappas bit,

47:45.840 --> 47:50.160
so I'm just going to steer, steer, steer off here, pull off on the junction.

47:50.160 --> 47:53.920
Pump, pump the brakes there, men of a certain age.

47:56.560 --> 47:57.040
I don't know.

47:59.440 --> 48:03.440
I really enjoyed the concept that douchiness is caused by comfort.

48:03.440 --> 48:04.240
I like that idea.

48:04.240 --> 48:07.360
Like douchiness is like a pair of sweatpants you slip into.

48:07.360 --> 48:11.200
It's not, I don't think that it's quite that matter of fact, but like,

48:13.120 --> 48:15.360
I think that is the way that it happens most of the time.

48:15.920 --> 48:16.880
You know what?

48:16.880 --> 48:17.520
Fuck it.

48:17.520 --> 48:21.200
If you become a douche and all your friends and family become douches too,

48:21.200 --> 48:26.400
like just, just try to like corral that and keep it inside your own bubble,

48:26.400 --> 48:28.080
but then just like live in it.

48:28.080 --> 48:29.120
It's fine.

48:29.120 --> 48:30.720
Hey guys, can I read a question?

48:30.720 --> 48:31.280
Oh shit.

48:32.480 --> 48:36.160
I know, but I really like this question and I feel like if Justin reads it,

48:36.160 --> 48:37.520
he'll cop out halfway through.

48:37.520 --> 48:38.000
Okay.

48:38.000 --> 48:38.400
Okay.

48:38.400 --> 48:39.680
That's always a good sign for me.

48:40.480 --> 48:42.160
As long as it's not about pee or farts.

48:42.800 --> 48:43.600
Oh no.

48:43.600 --> 48:47.280
My fellow coworker and I are having a debate and we need you to settle it for us.

48:47.280 --> 48:50.160
One day we both happened to use the urinal at work at the same time

48:50.160 --> 48:51.760
and my coworker passed gas.

48:52.400 --> 48:54.880
I told him you can't do that in public bathroom,

48:54.880 --> 48:57.120
only in the privacy of your own home.

48:57.120 --> 48:58.000
He disagreed.

48:58.000 --> 49:00.880
He stated that it's perfectly acceptable to fart in a public bathroom

49:00.880 --> 49:02.880
because that is what goes on in the bathroom.

49:02.880 --> 49:04.480
Please shed some light on the situation.

49:04.480 --> 49:06.160
And that's from Flatulent in Fargo.

49:06.800 --> 49:07.680
I don't want to do this.

49:07.680 --> 49:08.800
I can't talk about this.

49:09.360 --> 49:09.680
Yep.

49:09.680 --> 49:10.160
Come on.

49:10.160 --> 49:10.880
Farts.

49:10.880 --> 49:11.840
I don't want to do this.

49:11.840 --> 49:12.400
I don't want to talk.

49:12.400 --> 49:13.760
Why don't you guys want to talk about farts?

49:13.760 --> 49:16.160
Be an adult, talk about farts and pee and poopy and stuff.

49:16.160 --> 49:17.840
Okay, but I don't want to do any of that.

49:18.480 --> 49:19.280
No, but like an adult.

49:19.280 --> 49:20.160
Talk about it like an adult.

49:20.160 --> 49:22.560
No, but I don't want to do that.

49:22.560 --> 49:25.520
We'll call it flatness when you release flatness.

49:25.520 --> 49:27.120
Let me answer this question in like 10 seconds

49:27.120 --> 49:28.160
and then we can all move on with our lives

49:28.160 --> 49:29.920
and pretend we never talked about duty.

49:29.920 --> 49:30.420
Okay.

49:31.280 --> 49:34.560
Farting is 100% okay in the bathroom

49:34.560 --> 49:35.760
because you poop in the bathroom

49:35.760 --> 49:38.000
and what are you, some kind of fucking hypocrite?

49:38.000 --> 49:38.240
Yeah.

49:38.240 --> 49:38.480
Yep.

49:39.120 --> 49:39.760
Right?

49:39.760 --> 49:41.520
Farting in the bathroom, totally cool,

49:41.520 --> 49:43.520
and everybody pretending like it didn't happen.

49:43.520 --> 49:46.320
The FCC's back, they said, oh, you might as well

49:46.320 --> 49:48.080
title this episode Fart Placenta

49:48.080 --> 49:49.920
and then put a little sticker on it that says

49:49.920 --> 49:51.920
do not release and then don't release it.

49:51.920 --> 49:55.120
Oh, this one's going in the fucking Disney vault.

49:58.480 --> 50:01.200
Right next to the Blu-ray of the buried in placenta.

50:03.600 --> 50:05.840
We're going to bring that out back in 2030.

50:07.280 --> 50:09.360
Audiences will think that's tame by then.

50:09.360 --> 50:13.440
They'll be completely over the whole bear placenta thing.

50:13.440 --> 50:15.040
Let's do something else.

50:15.040 --> 50:15.920
Anything else, please.

50:16.800 --> 50:17.760
But farting's totally cool.

50:17.760 --> 50:18.800
Okay, next question.

50:20.080 --> 50:20.880
Next question.

50:21.760 --> 50:23.040
Did I ever tell you guys this story?

50:24.080 --> 50:25.280
I was in an airport bathroom

50:25.920 --> 50:28.880
and this dude was in the stall obviously on his phone

50:28.880 --> 50:30.800
having a conversation with someone

50:30.800 --> 50:33.840
and just going to town like some of the

50:34.880 --> 50:36.640
raunchiest toots I've ever heard

50:36.640 --> 50:38.240
and was just not holding back

50:38.240 --> 50:40.960
during a fucking conversation on the phone

50:40.960 --> 50:42.480
in a very public restroom.

50:42.480 --> 50:45.760
It was like a trumpet solo in a Chicago song.

50:45.760 --> 50:47.680
Yes, it was amazing.

50:48.720 --> 50:50.000
See, this bothers me.

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
This is why phones should...

50:52.000 --> 50:53.520
They should actually collect your phones

50:53.520 --> 50:54.960
before you go into a bathroom

50:54.960 --> 50:56.720
because by going into a bathroom

50:56.720 --> 50:58.960
you're entering into like a

50:58.960 --> 51:00.960
I know what you did last summer situation

51:00.960 --> 51:02.640
where we're all doing terrible things

51:02.640 --> 51:03.280
but we promised not to.

51:03.280 --> 51:04.240
It's the counter silence.

51:04.240 --> 51:06.000
Exactly, exactly.

51:06.000 --> 51:09.200
And you promise that the things that are happening in there

51:09.200 --> 51:10.560
you're just going to pretend never happened.

51:10.560 --> 51:12.080
And it's embarrassing when you're in a stall

51:12.080 --> 51:13.360
next to somebody else in a stall

51:13.360 --> 51:14.400
who's on their phone and they're like

51:14.400 --> 51:15.600
hey man, what's up?

51:15.600 --> 51:16.640
On their phone and you're like

51:18.960 --> 51:19.440
not much.

51:22.160 --> 51:23.760
I had some Taco Bell earlier.

51:23.760 --> 51:25.840
I had some Loco Drites.

51:25.840 --> 51:26.720
This is, why are we...

51:28.240 --> 51:30.720
Then he's like yeah, she's doing okay.

51:30.720 --> 51:32.960
You're like ah fuck, god damn it.

51:32.960 --> 51:33.920
And then you gotta pretend like

51:33.920 --> 51:35.840
you're having a conversation on your phone.

51:35.840 --> 51:37.280
Yeah, yeah dad.

51:37.840 --> 51:38.880
Sorry I haven't called in a while.

51:38.880 --> 51:40.880
I had a couple minutes free and...

51:40.880 --> 51:43.360
We've talked way too long about this.

51:43.360 --> 51:45.840
Here's a Yahoo answer that was sent in by Sam McKay.

51:45.840 --> 51:46.400
Thanks Sam.

51:46.400 --> 51:48.640
It's by Yahoo Answers user Haley who asks

51:50.640 --> 51:52.400
Cute inside jokes?

51:53.920 --> 51:55.360
I'm writing my friends' notes.

51:55.360 --> 51:57.040
Like you know the ones you pass in the halls

51:57.040 --> 51:59.120
and I don't want to be lame and repeat past things.

51:59.120 --> 52:00.080
I'm out of ideas.

52:00.080 --> 52:03.120
So are there cute inside jokes or funny things

52:03.120 --> 52:04.400
you and your friends talk about?

52:04.400 --> 52:05.840
Like examples from me.

52:05.840 --> 52:06.880
Banana face.

52:06.880 --> 52:09.760
Examples from me, banana face, inside joke.

52:11.200 --> 52:14.800
Neon nerds, with a Z, code name.

52:15.920 --> 52:17.600
Let's go eat ice cream.

52:17.600 --> 52:21.360
Random, choo choo, IDK.

52:22.720 --> 52:23.600
Stuff like that.

52:23.600 --> 52:25.280
Anything I could put down to be cute

52:25.280 --> 52:27.440
even though it might be a code name to someone else

52:27.440 --> 52:28.800
but just something cute for me.

52:28.800 --> 52:30.560
Please, smiley face, heart Haley.

52:30.560 --> 52:32.640
This is the grossest thing I've ever heard.

52:33.200 --> 52:34.400
Choo choo, IDK.

52:34.400 --> 52:37.040
Ice cream, random.

52:40.880 --> 52:42.160
Jelly bracelets.

52:44.320 --> 52:45.280
Dr. Scholls.

52:48.640 --> 52:51.440
Hey, I don't know how to write this to you

52:51.440 --> 52:57.120
but this was asked by a 50 year old man in high-focals

52:57.120 --> 53:00.560
eating Chef Boyardee out of the can.

53:00.560 --> 53:02.160
So it was a middle school plus 20.

53:02.160 --> 53:05.200
Yeah, he just wants to,

53:06.080 --> 53:07.920
just what are you guys talking about?

53:08.560 --> 53:10.000
What is happening there?

53:10.000 --> 53:10.960
I just want to know.

53:10.960 --> 53:12.080
I just want to know what the things are.

53:12.080 --> 53:14.080
Sneaker snappers, what's up?

53:15.840 --> 53:16.560
Edamame.

53:18.560 --> 53:20.080
You guys are really bad at this.

53:22.000 --> 53:22.800
Mop and Glow.

53:24.320 --> 53:24.560
Why?

53:26.240 --> 53:27.760
Power of Pine Soul.

53:27.760 --> 53:29.360
IRS form 1099.

53:30.160 --> 53:30.880
Why?

53:30.880 --> 53:32.240
Fukushimi.

53:32.240 --> 53:33.040
Fukushimi.

53:33.040 --> 53:34.400
It's Fushigi.

53:34.400 --> 53:34.960
Fushigi.

53:36.880 --> 53:37.440
Umari.

53:38.800 --> 53:39.600
Yakitori.

53:42.000 --> 53:43.040
Kwanzaa.

53:43.040 --> 53:45.040
Shamil Shamal, Little Paws, Pepper Incorporated.

53:45.040 --> 53:45.600
Random.

53:46.560 --> 53:47.680
Random, Kwanzaa.

53:48.240 --> 53:50.160
What do you think kids are talking about, Travis?

53:51.120 --> 53:52.240
Apparently I do not know.

53:54.240 --> 53:56.640
I thought I did until about five minutes ago.

53:56.640 --> 53:58.240
I thought I had my finger on the pulse.

53:58.240 --> 53:59.440
Pokemon cards.

53:59.440 --> 54:00.960
Words, LOL.

54:00.960 --> 54:02.320
I thought they talked about the Green Ranger

54:02.320 --> 54:03.600
turning into the White Ranger.

54:03.600 --> 54:04.240
Raffinator.

54:04.240 --> 54:04.880
That was way off.

54:06.640 --> 54:09.600
So yeah, any of those things that we just said,

54:09.600 --> 54:12.080
or you could just like collect two random words

54:12.080 --> 54:14.080
off of, I don't know, anything,

54:14.080 --> 54:16.160
and just say them with like a smiley face

54:16.160 --> 54:18.000
or like a lull, I think works.

54:18.640 --> 54:19.760
You can put lull in there.

54:22.160 --> 54:23.920
Do kids still use Tamagotchis?

54:23.920 --> 54:26.240
Can you talk about your Tamagotchi?

54:26.240 --> 54:27.840
They replace it with Fushigums.

54:27.840 --> 54:29.520
Fushigums?

54:29.520 --> 54:30.400
Fushigums?

54:30.400 --> 54:32.000
Hey, get over here, Fushigums.

54:32.000 --> 54:34.640
I can actually twirl my Tamagotchi.

54:34.640 --> 54:37.200
I can twirl my Tamagotchi between my fingers

54:37.200 --> 54:39.520
and elbows like a magic trick.

54:39.520 --> 54:40.400
He loves it too.

54:40.400 --> 54:41.360
He has such a good time.

54:42.160 --> 54:43.840
He makes a sad face and then poops

54:44.400 --> 54:46.560
and then I can play with him between my fingers

54:46.560 --> 54:48.160
and then I'll give him a walk.

54:49.440 --> 54:50.640
Those things are so fucking...

54:50.640 --> 54:52.880
You're playing with a calculator, idiot.

54:52.880 --> 54:54.400
Idiot Griffin from 2000.

54:55.280 --> 54:57.040
Stupid 1998 Griffin.

54:57.040 --> 54:58.160
Griffin, do better.

54:59.200 --> 55:01.680
I like how you retconned your age

55:01.680 --> 55:03.360
at which you thought Tamagotchis were incredible.

55:03.360 --> 55:06.320
I never bought a Tamagotchi.

55:06.320 --> 55:07.200
This is a true story.

55:07.200 --> 55:08.960
I was walking home from school one day.

55:08.960 --> 55:10.640
It was actually made in a giga pet.

55:10.640 --> 55:11.360
You remember that?

55:11.360 --> 55:12.400
It was like a knockoff.

55:12.400 --> 55:14.880
Anyway, I found it lying in the grass

55:14.880 --> 55:17.200
while I was walking home and the screen was cracked

55:17.200 --> 55:18.720
as if to insinuate somebody was like,

55:19.360 --> 55:22.400
you fucking giga pet and threw it to the ground.

55:22.400 --> 55:23.440
Like, I'm done with you.

55:23.440 --> 55:26.640
And that person is making someone a wonderful parent right now.

55:26.640 --> 55:27.140
Yeah.

55:27.140 --> 55:29.840
Fucking Timmy, get out of here.

55:29.840 --> 55:31.920
I'm sorry to have to do this,

55:31.920 --> 55:34.000
but I do think I need the rest of that story.

55:35.520 --> 55:37.520
What happens after you find the cracked giga pet?

55:37.520 --> 55:38.800
Do you throw it in the garbage?

55:38.800 --> 55:40.000
No, no, no, I kept him.

55:40.560 --> 55:42.000
Did you nurse him back to health?

55:42.000 --> 55:44.880
I mean, there was some structural,

55:44.880 --> 55:46.160
there was some hardware damage.

55:46.160 --> 55:48.720
Let's remake Homer bound with giga pets.

55:48.720 --> 55:50.720
You can think of something sadder right now.

55:50.720 --> 55:53.520
If you can think of something sadder right now

55:53.520 --> 55:57.120
than 12 year old Griffin playing with a cracked screen giga pet

55:57.120 --> 55:59.520
like some sort of war refugee.

55:59.520 --> 56:03.920
Please let me know what it is to watch this image from my mind.

56:03.920 --> 56:05.840
I couldn't be more depressed right now.

56:06.560 --> 56:10.800
He's wearing pumps, but our parents can afford pumps.

56:10.800 --> 56:11.760
They're squeezers.

56:14.160 --> 56:15.520
You're killing me now.

56:15.520 --> 56:18.080
I kept that giga pet very happy for two weeks

56:18.080 --> 56:19.680
and then the screen bled out

56:19.680 --> 56:21.120
and then I kept interacting with him

56:21.120 --> 56:22.640
even though I couldn't see him anymore.

56:23.440 --> 56:26.960
And then about two weeks after that, the battery died.

56:27.520 --> 56:29.840
I walked in on Griffin sucking out the juice

56:29.840 --> 56:31.840
from the liquid crystal display.

56:31.840 --> 56:34.960
He wanted the giga pet to live inside him forever.

56:37.840 --> 56:41.280
My body is just like a big mech suit

56:41.280 --> 56:42.960
for the giga pet that lives inside me.

56:43.600 --> 56:47.600
Okay, so this is when our dumb ass stupid show

56:47.600 --> 56:50.720
about placentas and shit called My Brother, My Brother, Me

56:50.720 --> 56:52.320
an advice show for the modern era.

56:53.040 --> 56:57.120
Thank you for listening for whatever dark purposes you have

56:57.120 --> 56:58.320
for doing that every week.

56:58.960 --> 57:02.400
Especially if you're in college, you should probably stop listening.

57:06.000 --> 57:09.280
Big love to the show.

57:09.280 --> 57:10.000
Big love.

57:10.000 --> 57:10.640
Big love.

57:11.280 --> 57:12.160
Bill Pullman.

57:13.760 --> 57:15.360
Getting it every day, Bill.

57:15.360 --> 57:16.320
Congratulations.

57:16.320 --> 57:19.280
Mace in your face just listened to 20 hours of Bim Bam

57:19.280 --> 57:21.200
on a long, long drive.

57:21.760 --> 57:22.720
So thanks to him.

57:23.280 --> 57:25.200
Thanks to everybody tweeting about the show

57:25.200 --> 57:28.720
with the M-B-A-M hashtag.

57:30.880 --> 57:41.840
Nick Wustrak, Lil Socrates, Heron Bird, Aurora Hack, Buzz Click, Miluno, everybody.

57:42.880 --> 57:44.800
I want to thank Sean Roderick and the Long Winters

57:44.800 --> 57:47.840
for the use of our theme song, It's a Departure off the album,

57:47.840 --> 57:48.880
putting the days to bed.

57:51.360 --> 57:52.640
Said it before, I'll say it again.

57:54.480 --> 57:55.200
It's a good band.

57:56.560 --> 57:57.200
Hey, Justin.

57:57.200 --> 57:57.700
Yes?

57:58.400 --> 58:02.160
On a personal note, I want to say that I'm very, very glad that Sydney is back

58:02.160 --> 58:04.240
and you guys are doing the satellite dish again.

58:04.240 --> 58:05.440
Oh, the satellite dish.

58:05.440 --> 58:07.680
You mean the satellite dish that you can find on iTunes

58:07.680 --> 58:09.200
by searching for satellite dish.

58:09.200 --> 58:10.960
And it's a comedy podcast about TV.

58:11.840 --> 58:12.400
That's correct.

58:12.400 --> 58:13.520
That I do with my wife.

58:13.520 --> 58:14.560
I missed it.

58:14.560 --> 58:16.800
You know what I didn't miss because it's still been here?

58:16.800 --> 58:18.240
The In Case of Emergency cast.

58:19.520 --> 58:21.840
What can you tell me about the In Case of Emergency podcast?

58:21.840 --> 58:25.440
About emergencies and you do it with two people

58:25.440 --> 58:27.280
and at least one of them is an Australian.

58:27.840 --> 58:28.720
That is correct.

58:28.720 --> 58:29.680
At least one of them.

58:29.680 --> 58:31.280
We haven't confirmed the other one yet.

58:31.280 --> 58:31.920
We're not sure.

58:31.920 --> 58:39.040
To my knowledge, at least 33.3 repeating percent of them are in fact Australian.

58:39.680 --> 58:42.160
And in case of emergency, you can find that on iTunes.

58:42.160 --> 58:43.840
Just search in case of emergency.

58:43.840 --> 58:46.160
Oh, you guys want to talk about Rap Zone?

58:47.760 --> 58:48.400
Yeah, Griffin.

58:48.400 --> 58:49.920
Tell us all about Rap Zone.

58:49.920 --> 58:52.000
Well, Rap Zone is a new podcast.

58:52.000 --> 58:53.120
It's not comedy based.

58:55.520 --> 58:58.400
There's nothing funny about rhyme.

58:58.400 --> 59:01.440
Like rhyme will come up with rhyme battles when you're battling

59:01.440 --> 59:02.960
and you have to rhyme somebody really fast.

59:04.720 --> 59:06.560
So Rap Zone is like my podcast.

59:06.560 --> 59:09.440
It's like an advice show, I guess.

59:09.440 --> 59:14.480
People like calling and ask their rap questions and I advise them.

59:14.480 --> 59:15.120
That sounds great.

59:15.120 --> 59:17.840
Now, can people find that on the Zoom marketplace?

59:17.840 --> 59:18.400
They can't.

59:19.360 --> 59:24.160
You have to hack into my sub network on Linux.

59:24.160 --> 59:25.680
It's more of a private chat.

59:25.680 --> 59:28.800
If you're a Linux user, I can send you my FTP.

59:29.600 --> 59:30.800
And if you see Griffin in public,

59:30.800 --> 59:34.400
he'll just give you a jazz disc that has the show on it.

59:34.400 --> 59:35.040
Yeah.

59:35.040 --> 59:36.080
And a jazz cigarette.

59:36.080 --> 59:37.440
Everybody has a jazz player, right?

59:37.440 --> 59:37.920
Yeah.

59:38.960 --> 59:42.400
I also want to say, while we're congratulating people,

59:42.400 --> 59:46.000
I want to give one more shout out to Chapman Cara

59:47.040 --> 59:51.120
because her Twitter icon is her wearing a shirt of ours

59:51.120 --> 59:52.720
in front of a poster of ours.

59:52.720 --> 59:53.760
And it makes me happy.

59:54.400 --> 59:54.640
Thank you.

59:54.640 --> 59:55.840
And we haven't mentioned it in a while,

59:55.840 --> 59:58.560
but go check out all the other wonderful Max Fun shows

59:58.560 --> 59:59.600
if you haven't yet.

59:59.600 --> 01:00:01.520
Especially, it's brand new.

01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:03.440
It's our newest one, Throwing Shade.

01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:04.480
If you haven't checked it out yet,

01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:06.880
it's every episode is consistently awesome.

01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:08.000
What's great about Throwing Shade is that

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.600
they're only like 30 episodes in.

01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:10.960
You can like listen to all of them.

01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:12.000
And then you can be caught up.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:15.360
Do you guys realize how hard it is to stay up on a podcast?

01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:17.920
Like, and have it all listened to?

01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:20.400
It's basically impossible.

01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:20.640
Yeah.

01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:21.520
But you can do it now.

01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:22.080
Get on board.

01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:23.760
Get on the Throwing Shade train

01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:25.360
because goddamn, it's the funniest.

01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:27.280
You've earned it.

01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:33.040
So that is our show.

01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:34.960
We really hope you enjoyed it.

01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:37.440
And we hope you will come back.

01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:39.120
Subscribe to us on iTunes and stuff.

01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:40.240
If you don't already.

01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:41.360
Which, how are you getting it?

01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:42.560
You piece of shit.

01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:45.760
Justin just dropped.

01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:48.240
Oh no, Justin.

01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:52.640
Justin just dropped a copy paste of an Amazon receipt

01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:54.560
for a Fushigi Magic Gravity Ball.

01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:56.160
You son of a bitch.

01:00:56.160 --> 01:00:57.360
And it comes with a CD.

01:00:57.360 --> 01:00:59.200
Is it the ball and CD-ROM?

01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:00.480
I think it's a combo.

01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:01.520
God, I hope so.

01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:04.000
If I just get the CD-ROM, I'm gonna be very put out.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.480
You could use Apple, maybe.

01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:14.880
This final Yahoo was sent in by Tom Powell or Thom Powell.

01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:15.760
Thank you, Tom Pom.

01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:19.200
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Frank, who asks,

01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:23.040
why are there so many gay Burger King commercials?

01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:28.320
I'm Justin McElroy.

01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:30.160
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:31.520
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:32.560
Kiss your dad.

01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:34.240
Just go wear out the lips.

01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:37.440
Keep your heart, Three Stacks.

01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:38.480
Keep your heart.

01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:40.640
Hey, keep your heart, Three Stacks.

01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:41.600
Keep your heart.

01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:42.960
Man, these girls are smart.

01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:44.720
Three Stacks, these girls are smart.

01:01:44.720 --> 01:02:02.480
Play your part.
