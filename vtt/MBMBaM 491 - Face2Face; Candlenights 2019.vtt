00:00.000 --> 00:07.760
the McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed.

00:07.760 --> 00:15.580
Travis claims he's a sexpert but if there's a degree on his wall I haven't

00:15.580 --> 00:26.400
seen it. Also this podcast kind of is for kids I guess just in case you babies out

00:26.400 --> 00:32.960
there know how cool you are for listening. What's up you cool baby!

00:56.400 --> 01:17.040
Hello everybody and welcome to my show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother Justin

01:17.040 --> 01:36.880
McElroy and I'm your middle brother Travis McElroy and I'm your sweet baby

01:36.880 --> 01:48.000
brother and 30 under 30 media luminary Griffin McElroy. Now I want to say as a

01:48.000 --> 01:53.600
longtime Huntingtonian first off welcome to our city. What a joy it is to have you

01:53.600 --> 01:57.840
here. I want to tell you it is a genuine honor and a pleasure to be playing here

01:57.840 --> 02:04.520
in the beautiful and historic Keith Albee Theatre. Now you will know the Keith

02:04.520 --> 02:10.360
Albee from its storied history as the place where that it's trash gif was made.

02:10.360 --> 02:17.040
Damn Justin I was gonna make that exact joke. So it's not a joke it's history

02:17.040 --> 02:21.320
Travis. It's a notable feature of this building that downstairs I opened a door

02:21.320 --> 02:27.440
and said it's trash and it became a very useful gif for a lot of people from 2016

02:27.440 --> 02:34.680
on. I'm sorry for that it's a storied theater and a lot of great times here.

02:34.680 --> 02:39.120
Griffin you had kind of your own adventure. Yeah fun time. Earlier today.

02:39.120 --> 02:46.280
Beautiful so glad to be here. Can I tell it from my point? Sure I think it'll hit

02:46.280 --> 02:50.240
harder if you hear it from Travis's point of view. So I got a okay this came

02:50.240 --> 02:54.600
after Griffin's wife Rachel said where is Griffin? There she's known for other

02:54.600 --> 03:00.820
things than being Griffin's wife. What I should say is Rachel's husband Griffin had

03:00.820 --> 03:08.440
gone missing and she said where is my husband Griffin and Justin and I

03:08.440 --> 03:15.560
simultaneously without checking said party and then five minutes later I get

03:15.560 --> 03:21.100
a call from Griffin that says hey it's your brother Griffin. You may know me

03:21.100 --> 03:28.360
from being Rachel's husband. And then he said I'm on the third floor I'm stuck in

03:28.360 --> 03:40.800
the bathroom so first I tried to go up that set of stairs and almost ate it on

03:40.800 --> 03:45.040
the stage in front of you all and then I learned you can only get to the third

03:45.040 --> 03:49.240
floor from that set of stairs and then I reached it and I said Griffin are you

03:49.240 --> 03:54.280
locked in? And he said no just stuck. The dang door got stuck. Listen folks hey it's

03:54.280 --> 04:02.520
me Griffin McElroy. It was not my finest moment and the worst part is that I

04:02.520 --> 04:07.760
don't only ask Travis to come help me out. So I heard the news ripple literally

04:07.760 --> 04:12.400
up a flight of stairs onto a completely different section of the theater because

04:12.400 --> 04:16.200
I called Travis in the basement and then I heard very quickly people on the first

04:16.200 --> 04:22.080
floor saying yeah Griffin's stuck in the bathroom. You probably heard my my peals

04:22.080 --> 04:27.040
of laughter my absolute delight. While I was still on the phone with Griffin I

04:27.040 --> 04:31.360
looked at Justin and said he's stuck in the bathroom. Yeah it was another I

04:31.360 --> 04:35.960
announced yeah I did announce it mid call. It was a good few minutes there

04:35.960 --> 04:40.040
before anyone came to fetch me from the bathroom and I do want to I do want to

04:40.040 --> 04:46.080
point out Griffin was not locked in just couldn't physically open the door

04:46.080 --> 04:52.720
the paint the paint of the doorframe and the door had like see a bit I I did to

04:52.720 --> 04:59.320
be fair have the shoulder jacket open. I have I I have a weak body I love this

04:59.320 --> 05:05.000
theater I love this theater it does say on the signs hanging over the toilets

05:05.000 --> 05:10.240
backstage says don't flush anything other than toilet paper to help preserve our

05:10.240 --> 05:16.400
historic plumbing and I wanted to respond to this bathroom sign and say

05:16.400 --> 05:22.960
this is history still in the making. I could have a I could have an important

05:22.960 --> 05:30.720
chapter in the history of this toilet. History is a living document. Yes so as you

05:30.720 --> 05:35.760
certainly guessed. Griffin's fine now. I spent three minutes locked in a bathroom knowing

05:35.760 --> 05:44.920
everyone backstage knew I was in there. There was an army of carolers laughing

05:44.920 --> 05:52.280
at me. To the point where three different people walked by and as I went up I heard a

05:52.280 --> 05:58.760
carolers say we might as well just keep the stairs open. So as you've guessed by

05:58.760 --> 06:04.200
this point it's an advice show that we do around here. It is a genuine pleasure

06:04.200 --> 06:09.000
to have you all on Huntington. I've met many of you at Jolly Pirate Donuts. I met

06:09.000 --> 06:14.280
you in line when I brought some of you Jolly Pirate Donuts. I met some of you

06:14.280 --> 06:20.760
when I tried unsuccessfully to park in the parking lot outside the theater and

06:20.760 --> 06:28.680
was chided by our fans so rippledly that I chickened out of parking and drove

06:28.680 --> 06:36.280
away. Now J-Man we did get an audience question that said why did Justin try to

06:36.280 --> 06:43.720
run me down in the parking lot? I was going very slowly and why were you in a

06:43.720 --> 06:50.360
parking lot? You can still kill someone slowly. It's for cars and softly. It's for cars. It's an

06:50.360 --> 06:57.840
advice show. Pleasure to be here in the historic Keith Albee theater. I am a master model builder

06:57.840 --> 07:03.120
for Legoland Discovery Center. Every day I have dozens of parents that come

07:03.120 --> 07:08.760
through and comment on how easy and fun my job must be. While this is true for

07:08.760 --> 07:14.040
the most part I still have the deadlines and paperwork of any other office job.

07:14.040 --> 07:21.000
Any other office job? Come on this is me Justin. There are lawyers. Yeah there's lawyers and stuff.

07:21.000 --> 07:27.080
There are doctors. My question is this how do I keep their fantastical view of

07:27.080 --> 07:31.280
the job alive while still preserving my fragile ego with the amount of real

07:31.280 --> 07:38.680
work I do? That's from Self-Centered in Central Ohio. Are you here?

07:41.600 --> 07:49.040
Do you have any paper made of Lego bricks you could write upon? Because

07:49.040 --> 07:53.400
then they would have to watch you make the paper and then maybe a pen made out

07:53.400 --> 07:57.720
of Legos and then you try to write and it doesn't work. This is a fantastic world

07:57.720 --> 08:05.560
Travis has swept us all away into. A subtle way to do it is if you just left

08:05.560 --> 08:14.200
all around Legoland just a little bit of blood from your hands and you wouldn't

08:14.200 --> 08:16.880
even make a big deal. I'm not saying you walk maybe you do walk around with

08:16.880 --> 08:20.720
bandages all over your hands and you let the parents piece it together. Oh and

08:20.720 --> 08:25.680
maybe like a Lego sign that says it's been zero days since our last incident.

08:25.680 --> 08:30.120
Just a bunch of headless Lego dolls scattered around the park. Maybe just a

08:30.120 --> 08:36.200
bin of heads and you can be like oh those we don't talk about those. This is what

08:36.200 --> 08:41.520
happens when I lose focus for a second. Look at that Chewbacca. I spent all day on

08:41.520 --> 08:47.960
that Chewbacca's leg fell off. Fell the heck over. And OSHA's on my... OSHA's on my

08:47.960 --> 08:56.200
keister. Oh yeah this is a no cursing show. We're gonna do our best. OSHA's on my

08:56.200 --> 08:59.520
keister. It has to happen right that something you're building collapses.

08:59.520 --> 09:03.400
Maybe not all the time. Hopefully. No you are going to have to sabotage some of

09:03.400 --> 09:09.380
your own creations. Something so beautiful it cannot exist. Right. Something

09:09.380 --> 09:17.400
maybe you're making the Sistine Chapel and maybe God destroys it. God destroys

09:17.400 --> 09:20.720
your Lego Chapel because it's not it's better than his chapel. Yeah and then you

09:20.720 --> 09:25.080
just fall to your knees and you curse to the heavens like you do. Next thing you

09:25.080 --> 09:32.920
build out. And Tom Hanks comes in and says yeah. Okay wait wait wait. Was that a

09:32.920 --> 09:36.480
Da Vinci code? I'm trying to think of literally any other Tom Hanks movie that

09:36.480 --> 09:41.040
it would be. It is but I also just assume that at this point Tom Hanks is a mouthpiece for

09:41.040 --> 09:52.720
God. And he is also at Legoland most days. He loves them. He loves Legos. He likes the noise actually. That's the thing. It's not the

09:52.720 --> 10:02.560
aesthetic. It's the snap noise. It's his ASMR. Hey how about a Yahoo? Yes please.

10:02.560 --> 10:10.600
This one was sent in by Adrian Cowles. Are you here? No. Wait. Shh. Are you here?

10:10.600 --> 10:14.800
Oh maybe not. Oh man. I thought Adrian was supposed to be here. I may be putting

10:14.800 --> 10:19.280
Adrian on blast and maybe Adrian doesn't want to be put on blast. Adrian are you not here? It's not good.

10:19.280 --> 10:26.360
Okay anyway Adrian Cowles is a hero to all. It's from Yahoo Answers user Jamooka

10:26.360 --> 10:35.520
who asks with all the milk Santa drinks where does he go when he has to go?

10:35.520 --> 10:44.640
Obviously in the sleigh. Oh. That would be my guess is he's got a Santa's Little

10:44.640 --> 10:55.760
Helper if you know what I mean. I don't. Viagra? Not Viagra. A bucket? That you call Santa's Little Helper?

10:55.760 --> 11:00.720
A suction like kind of like the mass that drops down on an airplane but he's

11:00.720 --> 11:07.600
got a tube. He's got a tube in there. He's got a tube in there and he just

11:07.600 --> 11:12.720
pees into it and then it fills up a pouch. Just one? Because it's a lot of

11:12.720 --> 11:22.760
milk. It's a lot of pouches and they're. The sleigh is most it's 10% presents 90%

11:22.760 --> 11:27.720
Santa pee pouches. Griffin have you seen that thing that you attach to a spigot

11:27.720 --> 11:31.800
and it fills up a bunch of water balloons at once? Yes. It's like that and

11:31.800 --> 11:38.160
then he dumps them in to the ocean. Okay Santa has been studying with Sting and

11:38.160 --> 11:42.840
just at the end of once a night. Oh wow Travis has just introduced a

11:42.840 --> 11:47.720
fascinating new concept into my life which is how long can sting go without

11:47.720 --> 11:57.960
having to drain the main vein as they say. Okay if Santa had to stop every time. I'm just

11:57.960 --> 12:02.480
realizing that as Sting gets older he will be able to have tangerine sex

12:02.480 --> 12:09.920
without. Hold on one second. Nutting.

12:09.920 --> 12:19.400
It's on the line for more and more time but have to go to the bathroom more and

12:19.400 --> 12:26.040
more frequently. So he will have to. Listen I'm not gonna you know. I don't

12:26.040 --> 12:30.440
want you to think. I don't want you to think that I'm gonna you know. I just

12:30.440 --> 12:36.040
gotta you know. The other one that comes out. The make some of the. I'm gonna keep my

12:36.040 --> 12:42.160
lapel mic on. I gotta make some of the fields of gold if you know what I'm

12:42.160 --> 12:49.840
saying. I will not. And then I was going to say the c-word but I think that's I will not nut.

12:49.840 --> 12:56.840
Little Gordon's gotta. Yeah I want to move away from. No. This region.

12:56.840 --> 13:01.400
Impossible. I'm just saying that if Santa had to stop yeah every let's even say

13:01.400 --> 13:07.360
one hour two hour to relieve himself. That's a lot of time lost. I think he has

13:07.360 --> 13:14.920
to make it to the end of the night. And then. A two hour long. Crazy. Okay you know what.

13:14.920 --> 13:21.120
Here's the only thing that makes sense. Alright okay. That's a thousand. Okay

13:21.120 --> 13:24.960
that's that's a quarter in the swear jar and I'm sorry.

13:24.960 --> 13:31.960
The only. Also this whole conversation I forgot we had an ASL ASL interpreter.

13:31.960 --> 13:39.360
And I'm sorry for that. I am so sorry for you and you and us. So anyway the only

13:39.360 --> 13:44.600
thing that makes sense is that Santa's peeing in your house and he's doing it

13:44.600 --> 13:50.520
while he's eating the cookies. It's the only time. The time lost. The time lost.

13:50.520 --> 13:57.120
His pee lost. Neck neutral. He's taking the cookies into the bathroom. He's urinating.

13:57.120 --> 14:02.040
He's eating the cookies and drinking the milk. Ouroboros the snake eat its own tail.

14:02.040 --> 14:16.000
The cycle continues ad infinitum. Unless. Unless. Santa Claus is just always going

14:16.000 --> 14:30.320
a little bit. ABP. Just a little bit. That's what they don't tell you in the

14:30.320 --> 14:36.160
Santa Claus film. Says here no matter what my beard grows back all the time

14:36.160 --> 14:39.920
because I killed a man and that's my eternal punishment and I'm always kind

14:39.920 --> 14:45.800
of peeing sort of. That's the thing you see only eats and drinks one night of

14:45.800 --> 14:51.920
the year and then pees a little bit for the next 364 days. I have another question here

14:51.920 --> 14:59.560
and I'm sure you're all relieved to hear that. Not literally relieved. I'm a zoo

14:59.560 --> 15:04.600
keeper at a small zoo in West Virginia humblebrag. Sometimes people who come to

15:04.600 --> 15:10.080
the zoo think that some of our animals are fake. Alligator, Burmese python, etc.

15:10.080 --> 15:15.120
Those are some animals. They usually ask me if they are real because they don't

15:15.120 --> 15:19.520
move around a lot. I respond with a yes but even then they aren't convinced. What

15:19.520 --> 15:24.120
are some ways I can absolutely convince them these guests that our animals are

15:24.120 --> 15:29.960
real. That's from real wild and real wonderful animal keeper. Are you here?

15:29.960 --> 15:38.200
Hello. Hello. To be fair some of those people also think they're dead. Are those

15:38.200 --> 15:48.200
real and also alive? Because I'm a zoo cop. That is fair. I'm a bad zoo man. I've taken

15:48.200 --> 15:54.880
my three-year-old to a lot of zoos too and most of the time when she sees any

15:54.880 --> 15:59.080
animal even an active animal she's like is that real because there are

15:59.080 --> 16:04.400
animatronics and holograms now it's hard to know let alone like an alligator

16:04.400 --> 16:09.160
who's just sitting there. If we're being honest the alligator isn't bringing a

16:09.160 --> 16:15.600
lot to the table. Yeah, alligators are whack. That's a deepfake puma. That's not a real...

16:15.600 --> 16:24.640
I think the way you can get around this especially with the alligator and

16:24.640 --> 16:33.440
especially with the Burmese python is to open the door and just say go on in. Now

16:33.440 --> 16:39.240
wait Griffin okay. Maybe it's real maybe it isn't. Are you brave enough to find

16:39.240 --> 16:45.720
out? Okay it's not an escape room Griffin. Let's see you put up or shut up if

16:45.720 --> 16:52.200
these are real or not. If they're real you're gonna be real dead. Hey Griffin

16:52.200 --> 16:58.040
you know a zookeeper is not mostly there to protect the animals right? Listen they

16:58.040 --> 17:01.880
are if you ask me. Here's the other thing. How many times do you think a

17:01.880 --> 17:07.240
professional zookeeper gets to say the phrase go on in then before they lose

17:07.240 --> 17:11.440
their job and charges are pressed against them? Like once right? It's just

17:11.440 --> 17:16.640
the one. Hold on if that is if that is started with did you sign the waiver go

17:16.640 --> 17:22.520
on in. Because there are things where you can go in and meet penguins and sometimes

17:22.520 --> 17:30.680
penguins are having a real bad day. But the kids will see. The kids will see. The

17:30.680 --> 17:35.160
blood. The kids will see the blood as the beautiful beautiful python eats the

17:35.160 --> 17:39.440
disbelieving grandma. And then the kids will go I've learned a lot about

17:39.440 --> 17:44.880
humanity. This is an educational zoo thank you for bringing me. I've learned about snake-anity today. Oh that's one thing you

17:44.880 --> 17:51.320
do is you could put a fake python in the python zone but have like a human

17:51.320 --> 17:58.040
outline sort of inside of the fake python and then be like go on in then.

17:58.040 --> 18:05.400
That guy thought the pythons were fake. Look how he fared. Not good it seems. How

18:05.400 --> 18:08.800
about a yahoo? I'd love that Griffin. Thank you. A lot of people sent this one in.

18:08.800 --> 18:17.600
It's from an anonymous yahoo answers user who is I'm going to call Torbance

18:17.600 --> 18:24.680
asks Torbance asks what happened if the cops are arresting someone on December

18:24.680 --> 18:32.440
23 and it hits midnight on Christmas Eve will they stop as they close Christmas?

18:37.320 --> 18:44.760
So the premise is you're free to go shoot we're close Christmas. But more

18:44.760 --> 18:50.360
than okay if they meant every word of that intentionally what it is saying is

18:50.360 --> 18:56.120
oh we've hit midnight it's now the 24th and this paperwork will take us at least

18:56.120 --> 19:02.760
24 hours. No they're closed for Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. Why do you want them to work all the time?

19:02.760 --> 19:06.920
Come on. Let them have a good time with their families. When are they going to leave cookies out for dinner?

19:06.920 --> 19:12.920
That's fair. You're right you've got oh you did murder eight people but I gotta get

19:12.920 --> 19:20.920
home and put that goose on the stove. It's okay I can't murder on Christmas Eve anyway.

19:20.920 --> 19:28.360
Good night coppers. I'll be back on Boxing Day when I'm putting all those people in boxes.

19:28.360 --> 19:37.000
Sorry fellas it's December 24th there's Santa's problem now.

19:37.000 --> 19:45.400
What I'm suggesting is this he knows when you've been sleeping he knows if you're awake

19:46.120 --> 19:56.280
he knows if you did larceny so he's the cops now and I'm saying December 24th and 25th Santa's

19:56.280 --> 20:02.920
out there he sees everything that's happening Santa can be cops on those days. That is why no murder has

20:02.920 --> 20:07.640
ever happened on the 24th or 25th. I'm not saying it doesn't happen I'm just saying they don't get toys

20:09.560 --> 20:14.760
which is I think we can all agree the worst punishment worst thing that can happen.

20:14.760 --> 20:21.080
There has to be a third list yes if Santa's cops for two days. Oh so naughty nice death penalty.

20:21.080 --> 20:34.280
Naughty nice list naughty list slay. Slay's pretty good. Nice list naughty list naughty list special

20:34.280 --> 20:47.640
victims unit. When him and his partner Christopher Maloney go out I would watch that show.

20:47.640 --> 20:53.720
I would watch that show. I don't have anything else Santa's cops for two days.

20:53.720 --> 20:58.840
Santa's cops that's where we're at. Santa's cops for two days. Should we move on to another question?

20:58.840 --> 21:01.880
I have a segment. Oh no.

21:06.520 --> 21:11.400
So I have a segment you might not have heard it yet it is a newer segment. Oh this one's good okay.

21:11.400 --> 21:21.880
Bum bum bum bum reach for the stars. In this segment I'm going to read some reviews from

21:21.880 --> 21:28.760
Amazon and Justin and Griffin have to guess what the product is. Now this this is only two. This

21:28.760 --> 21:32.600
is only two reviews. I've got three different products here. This is a short one. Okay.

21:32.600 --> 21:40.280
This is a three-star review out of five. The subject line is short-lived.

21:42.760 --> 21:50.040
I love this guy but sadly I got him out for a second season and he no longer works. Wish he

21:50.040 --> 21:57.000
would have lasted longer and also I've never mentioned this before but one person found this

21:57.000 --> 22:03.560
helpful. Okay I'm gonna say it is a Christmas themed Big Mouth Billy Bass. Okay.

22:05.880 --> 22:15.960
Christmas sprinkler. Okay this one might give it away. This is from Roger. This is the five-star

22:15.960 --> 22:25.720
review. For my granddaughter she loves it. He can really twerk. Is it a twerking Santa

22:25.720 --> 22:32.680
Trout? Yes it is a twerking Santa. Yes it is a twerking Santa Justin. That poor first person.

22:32.680 --> 22:38.920
I know. What is this broken twerking Santa look at this poor low energy.

22:44.680 --> 22:52.760
Wouldn't wouldn't you have given anything to be in the room when this old man stares down

22:52.760 --> 22:59.880
at his Santa and says dang thing's supposed to be twerking. Hey hey watch I'm gonna plug him in watch

22:59.880 --> 23:10.120
this. Oh oh man I thought he'd twerk. You can do it put your back into it. Okay so these next two

23:10.120 --> 23:18.520
the last two uh there's a theme these are both Christmas movies. Okay. This is a one-star review

23:18.520 --> 23:29.320
with the subject line heartwarming but strange. If you have a taste for the strange this is the

23:29.320 --> 23:37.800
Christmas movie for you. Bad in every way but we were able to watch it to the end.

23:40.600 --> 23:46.920
Congratulations that's great. Uh I'm gonna say jingle all the way to starring Larry the Cable

23:46.920 --> 23:51.960
starring Larry the Cable Call. Uh National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation. Incorrect.

23:53.800 --> 24:00.760
Two. Nope. Eddie's Island Getaway. This subject line one star review subject line

24:00.760 --> 24:02.840
Spartan helmets don't float.

24:02.840 --> 24:12.920
And the rest of it is and also everything else was just hot garbage as well.

24:21.640 --> 24:25.880
Do you want me to read it again? Is it is it um 300 Crazy Nights?

24:25.880 --> 24:32.840
That's funnier than anything I was gonna say. Okay this is a three-star review. The subject line

24:32.840 --> 24:41.480
is so dumb. I watched this to the end because I was hoping it would get better but it never did.

24:41.480 --> 24:49.080
I gave it three because tween girls would probably love it. So this is one film that tween girls

24:49.080 --> 24:56.680
would probably love and Spartan helmets don't float. And it's what was the first one it's they

24:56.680 --> 25:01.320
hated it but they did. Yeah heartwarming but strange. Heartwarming but strange.

25:03.880 --> 25:05.240
It's a wonderful life.

25:08.200 --> 25:15.400
National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation 3. That's what I made up. That's gonna be a mermaid for

25:15.400 --> 25:26.680
Christmas. A mermaid for Christmas? Okay now this these these reviews make me so happy. All right.

25:27.240 --> 25:30.040
Subject line soft porn.

25:32.040 --> 25:40.760
One star. This has been advertised as a classic Christmas movie. We sat down to watch it with our

25:40.760 --> 25:48.680
teen-aged grandchild. I ignored the r-rating thinking it must be incorrect. It was not.

25:49.400 --> 25:57.880
It is a piece of trash full of the most vile cursing I have heard. It is full of soft porn

25:57.880 --> 26:06.360
showing naked adults acting out copulation. I turned it off and threw it in the garbage where

26:06.360 --> 26:14.040
it belongs. I am not a prude but was much embarrassed to have played a part of it

26:14.040 --> 26:20.840
for my relatives. Amazon should move it to their adults only section. Does Amazon have a

26:20.840 --> 26:29.400
pornography section? This is a question I'm genuinely asking. Before you guys guess I just

26:29.400 --> 26:37.800
have to keep reading them because it goes on and on. It is the bad Santa. Is it the bad Santa?

26:37.800 --> 26:42.600
This is a one-star review. Subject line nudity shocking.

26:45.000 --> 26:46.760
Was shocked by the nudity.

26:46.760 --> 26:57.880
Inappropriate for viewing. Will need to only watch the edited version on TV.

27:00.280 --> 27:05.960
The rest of the content has a great positive message about the holiday. This is a one-star

27:05.960 --> 27:12.040
review and the subject line is one star. Should be x-rated. Went in the trash.

27:12.040 --> 27:19.160
One-star review. This is not a family Christmas movie. Would not have rented this movie if I had

27:19.160 --> 27:26.280
seen the R rating. Filthy language innuendo. Not suitable to be listed as a Christmas movie.

27:26.280 --> 27:31.320
Very disappointed that I cannot get a refund. I rent a lot of movies.

27:31.320 --> 27:40.040
I rent a lot of movies. Okay one more. One-star review. Yuck.

27:42.520 --> 27:49.640
Seriously this movie is one creepy situation after another. Sleazy unprofessional work

27:49.640 --> 27:56.760
relationships. Old men and young women. Very bizarre fake sex on a movie set.

27:56.760 --> 28:03.080
Okay this movie does not age well. It's a wonderful life.

28:06.680 --> 28:12.920
Do y'all know what it is? Because I haven't. Justin guess. I don't know. It's Love Actually.

28:16.520 --> 28:17.080
Yuck.

28:20.040 --> 28:23.720
Now I have not. Oh no we wore out the first interpreter.

28:23.720 --> 28:33.960
Was it all the yelling? Yes. The hand movements had to be bigger. Okay. Now I've never seen

28:33.960 --> 28:41.000
Love Actually. How close did I approximate it? The summer camp I work for holds an annual ravioli

28:41.000 --> 28:47.000
eating contest among the staff. I have been whiplash from what Travis just did to the first

28:47.000 --> 28:54.360
thing you just said. I have been dubbed the ravioli champion as I have won for the past

28:54.360 --> 29:01.480
five years due to some changes in my health. I'm okay. I just gotta eat better. Yeah. Yeah. We all

29:01.480 --> 29:08.360
do. Time passes. Yeah but also you're the ravioli champion so I assume you do indeed have to eat

29:08.360 --> 29:15.080
better. I've come to the conclusion that. My one defining feature is I consume a lot of ravioli.

29:15.080 --> 29:20.280
Anyways I have some health concerns. I've come to the conclusion that I won't be able to

29:20.280 --> 29:25.160
participate next year. When I tried to tell my co-workers this they all thought I was joking.

29:25.160 --> 29:30.280
They even got me a certificate framed and all to hang on my wall for my past achievements

29:30.280 --> 29:35.400
engorging myself on pasta. Brothers how do I resist the peer pressure to eat a ridiculous

29:35.400 --> 29:40.920
amount of ravioli and remain a champion. That's from stuffed in Scotch Plains New Jersey are you

29:40.920 --> 29:51.080
here. That's a ravioli king if I've ever. You know the one thing I do have to say before we begin

29:51.080 --> 29:58.520
with the great goofs and spoofs a ravioli eating competition. Is this a common thing that I'm just

29:58.520 --> 30:03.800
not plugged into. No no here's what I will say because I edited this question down for time

30:03.800 --> 30:08.680
but there was a line in it where they said that there was a restaurant in the town of the summer

30:08.680 --> 30:15.400
camp that had an all you could eat ravioli night. Okay which in and of itself seems like it should

30:15.400 --> 30:24.280
be shut down by the CDC. Yeah ravioli is not a type of food that I think I could stomach infinite

30:24.280 --> 30:29.880
of. No ravioli is not the type of food where I eat a heaping helping and I say I could eat

30:30.760 --> 30:35.160
three to four more heaping helpings of ravioli please. It actually seems like you could like

30:35.160 --> 30:41.560
set up a weird drinking style game but ravioli game where you set up a chess board with different

30:41.560 --> 30:47.160
ravioli squares and if you land on one the other person have to eat it and they die. That's a fun

30:47.160 --> 30:57.080
game that you just invented. Thank you. I think I think you have to participate. Wait cool let me

30:57.080 --> 31:06.840
finish. You can't be ravioli champion and then just bow out and not let people take a shot at

31:08.200 --> 31:13.560
the master of ravioli at the ravioli champion right. They gotta have a shot at the crown.

31:13.560 --> 31:19.640
What you gotta do is go in and I'm sorry eat a tasteful amount of ravioli.

31:19.640 --> 31:29.400
Just a regular healthy portion of ravioli. You know six. Yeah it's six. You're no longer able to

31:29.400 --> 31:34.520
compete at the maximum level and it's fair for you to bow out but honestly you do have to lose.

31:34.520 --> 31:42.200
I think you should have to lose. Now here's what I will say bet against yourself. Okay take a fall.

31:42.200 --> 31:48.920
Yeah now you're the ravioli champion there is a certificate in your cubicle or whatever.

31:50.440 --> 31:55.400
Put a large amount of money against yourself. Is there a danger Travis? Is there a danger that you

31:55.400 --> 32:00.600
won't make it into the ravioli hall of fame? No that they'll start eating the ravioli and then

32:00.600 --> 32:12.760
well I do love this wonderful stuff. Oh don't get that ravioli madness. I do have the fire of

32:12.760 --> 32:18.760
competition in my belly and I do have the plaque and all. That's always a risk Justin. I guess I

32:18.760 --> 32:26.840
should go ahead and pound more ravioli. I'm worried about that. It might happen. And then

32:26.840 --> 32:33.160
that stinks because you die of ravioli poisoning and also you lost your dang money is the other

32:33.160 --> 32:40.440
thing that you bet against yourself. You may eat what you think is a normal amount of ravioli

32:40.440 --> 32:45.400
make it to the end and they're like you won by a lot and you look at everybody else like what's

32:45.400 --> 32:52.440
wrong with you all? This stuff is amazing. That is a good question. Have you often won by two

32:52.440 --> 32:59.400
or three times as much as everyone else? Because it might just be when you've eaten one more than

32:59.400 --> 33:11.000
the next person. Stop. I'm just now realizing I'm really hungry for ravioli. I know right?

33:11.960 --> 33:19.000
I could go for some ravioli right now. I need to be the devil's advocate here and say

33:19.000 --> 33:27.640
don't enter the ravioli competition. Follow your instincts. Griffin's right. Don't enter the ravioli

33:27.640 --> 33:34.680
competition. Let someone win then challenge them. It's the second movie. You train someone to win.

33:34.680 --> 33:41.800
That's ravioli one. Then you're coming back for ravioli two to beat the person you trained because

33:41.800 --> 33:47.400
they got pretty cocky and you need to show them what a real ravioli champ looks like. It's like in

33:47.400 --> 34:05.160
Rocky 2 ravioli three yeah someone else eats your friend. Yes it would be like if in Rocky 2 Rocky's

34:05.160 --> 34:13.160
doctor was like hey your cholesterol is crazy. You can't just keep drinking eggs out of a pitcher.

34:13.160 --> 34:20.520
All you have to do is stop eating. No one's paying you to eat eggs. I'm the best egg eater.

34:20.520 --> 34:25.960
That's not it Rocky. That's nothing. The movie's not about you being a good egg eater. Then what's

34:25.960 --> 34:33.160
it about? You could just have some celery. You burn more calories eating. I want to eat eggs.

34:33.160 --> 34:51.000
But I'm the egg eater. Did you say egg-rian out loud? I did. That's fun. It just came across my...

34:51.000 --> 34:54.760
What if just slowly behind that hut a doll rose up?

34:54.760 --> 35:06.120
Paul don't do it. Hunt a doll watch. If you've never listened to our program before

35:06.120 --> 35:12.120
and it's in this room distinct possibility. How many of you just heard there was something going

35:12.120 --> 35:16.120
on in Huntington today? You saw a huge line of people and you're like screw it I'll hop in line.

35:17.560 --> 35:24.360
We like to keep tabs on the paranormal being sold on the electronic bay and here's one I found

35:24.360 --> 35:31.080
today. Oh I'm looking at it. It's a two and a half foot tall Santa statue with a beach ball and a red

35:31.080 --> 35:39.080
hat. Oh no. No it's not the haunted doll on the stage. This is haunted doll Jody a sad paranormal

35:39.080 --> 35:46.120
doll. Oh currently it's on sale for ten dollars. I'm assuming it will not be by the time this

35:46.120 --> 35:53.000
segment has ended. Haunted doll Jody a sad paranormal doll put on sale by Pretty Willow.

35:53.000 --> 36:00.760
335 ratings 100% positive feedback. This doll haunted. That's a guarantee from your friend

36:00.760 --> 36:08.600
Jess McRoy. Haunted doll Jody sad paranormal doll story on Jody. I just got her last weekend along

36:08.600 --> 36:14.120
with many other dolls but I have a few dolls that are getting upset that there are so many in my

36:14.120 --> 36:22.120
home now. That will happen. Hey Jody is it the dolls or is it your niece Vicky? Are the dolls upset or

36:22.120 --> 36:26.600
does Vicky say you need to clean this house or I'm moving out? Oh I thought you said that the dolls

36:26.600 --> 36:33.240
didn't like Vicky. I have a few other dolls getting upset. There's so many in my home now. With this

36:33.240 --> 36:41.160
being said I work with all my dolls and many of them have many stories to tell. Expect this little

36:41.160 --> 36:52.840
doll. That's just what it says. It says expect this little doll. Expect it. I will deliver. Jody is

36:52.840 --> 36:59.800
near five inches tall. She is old and she was found when my son and I did a paranormal investigation

36:59.800 --> 37:07.720
on a private property that was abandoned. Private property. So you looted. You robbed. I think a private

37:07.720 --> 37:14.120
property that is abandoned is a public property right? I still think it's right. No one was in the

37:14.120 --> 37:20.280
house when we broke in. Yeah to look for haunted dolls. Along with her there was many other dolls

37:20.280 --> 37:27.240
that I had found. The owner said I could have the dolls. Wait hold on. Hold on. I don't believe you.

37:27.240 --> 37:33.480
It was a private property that was abandoned and you said hey can we loot your house and they were

37:33.480 --> 37:39.400
like take whatever. Yeah you don't want me to loot. Stay perfectly quiet. They told me by how

37:39.400 --> 37:46.600
asleep they were. The owner said I could have the dolls. They have been there for such a long time

37:46.600 --> 37:52.760
and he never really bothered with them. So after bringing these dolls into my home I decided to try

37:52.760 --> 37:58.840
to work with this one first doing a spirit box on this doll. Yeah. I can't really get clear answers

37:58.840 --> 38:06.040
from this doll other than her name is Jody. She won't give me an age but she says she's very sad

38:06.680 --> 38:16.360
and she was locked away too long. I don't feel she is bad just sad. That sounds like you apologizing

38:16.360 --> 38:23.480
for a friend that none of your other friends like. Yeah. They're not bad. They're just

38:23.480 --> 38:30.920
sad. So I don't have time right now. He's just hungry. I don't have time right now to keep trying

38:30.920 --> 38:40.680
to get answers from her. I'm busy. So why are you getting rid of your dog? I just can't with Jody

38:40.680 --> 38:48.040
anymore. Woof. This doll would be great if you have time to talk to her and maybe get the answers

38:48.040 --> 38:57.640
yourself. So if you work for yourself from home adopt Jody. I do feel sad when I hold her. I must

38:57.640 --> 39:06.680
have this doll. I would love to have something to blame my sadness on. Griffin why are you so sad

39:06.680 --> 39:13.720
all the time? I don't know but I'm holding this doll. I cannot guarantee your doll will quote

39:13.720 --> 39:21.080
perform for you. These are real individuals that lived real lives and are worthy of respect.

39:21.800 --> 39:28.200
None of those three things are true. They may take a bit of time to warm up to you or they may

39:28.200 --> 39:35.240
show themselves to you right away or they might just be an empty doll. Please do not adopt a

39:35.240 --> 39:40.920
haunted object with no intent of offering them attention. They're like a Tamagotchi folks. You

39:40.920 --> 39:48.360
have to take care of them or communication. They're human beings. They're not though.

39:49.000 --> 39:55.960
Even if they're ghosts they're ghosts. They don't need to eat or sleep or drink or anything.

39:55.960 --> 40:03.880
They're human beings not party tricks or meant to just sit on a shelf. So you want don't expect

40:03.880 --> 40:11.400
them to do tricks but don't not expect them to do tricks either. Have them do some tricks.

40:12.200 --> 40:18.280
An adoption to be taken seriously particularly with children that need a motherly touch.

40:18.280 --> 40:25.080
Wait whoa hey big joke. That sentence is a journey.

40:27.560 --> 40:31.240
English was not meant to convey this level of information

40:31.240 --> 40:37.000
with just a scant few words but suddenly this person's entire world has been opened up to.

40:37.640 --> 40:43.880
Come walk in the door of those 10 words and see their entire existence laid bare.

40:44.600 --> 40:50.600
If you have any questions feel free to ask. Oh I have questions. What was the last thing you just

40:50.600 --> 40:56.760
said all about? Jump back 10 words one more again. Due to eBay rules I must pose this.

40:56.760 --> 41:02.760
All paranormal dolls and stories are for entertainment purposes but I'll let you be the

41:02.760 --> 41:10.600
judge of that. If you have any questions feel free to ask me. All caps. I will be listing many more.

41:11.960 --> 41:17.640
The end. That's Haunted Doll Watch. Do you think when they list in the thing like this is for

41:17.640 --> 41:22.360
entertainment purposes only but I'll let you be the judge of that. eBay like contacts them like

41:22.360 --> 41:29.960
hey you can't. You can't actually say psych at the end. It's like a rule. We asked you not to do

41:29.960 --> 41:35.720
like it's like if we said you can't sell weed and like this is a weed but it is. It is weed.

41:35.720 --> 41:42.040
It's not weed but it's green and when you burn it it gets you high. Great. All right we can do

41:42.040 --> 41:46.360
audience questions. We have some sent in by you all. If we can get house lights turned on. No

41:46.360 --> 41:52.360
listen there were no seat numbers so we have like names we'll do first initial and if there's any

41:52.360 --> 41:57.800
confusion all right first. We're gonna say the first initial of a first name. I meant the first

41:57.800 --> 42:03.480
initial of the last name. All bees rust the stage. Yes. All bees. So we have a microphone right here

42:48.840 --> 42:56.280
question about some bones. All right. What's the deal with these bones? We're gonna need more house

42:56.280 --> 43:00.360
lights because weirdly you're illuminating everybody but the people standing at the

43:00.360 --> 43:06.120
microphones. That may be all we got to work with. It's a historic theater. Okay friend over. Hey

43:06.120 --> 43:12.040

and special holiday magic. Okay here we go. We'll start over here. Hi. No here's where. Oh my god

43:17.240 --> 43:23.720
it's kind of working. Hello over here. Hi. Hi. If you're directly in front of the person we probably

43:23.720 --> 43:29.400
don't need to do that. Okay go on. Um okay so my grandmother. Oh what's your sorry what's your name?

43:29.400 --> 43:34.120
Oh yeah sorry hi I'm Maddie. Hi Maddie. Thank you Maddie. Yes if you want to give your pronouns that

43:34.120 --> 43:39.880
would be very helpful. Thank you. So my grandmother is in the hospital and she like went to the

43:39.880 --> 43:45.640
hospital like three days ago and so we were like oh no she is not going to be out for Christmas.

43:46.280 --> 43:53.080
Um but my grandmother. Turn it around. Come on. Yeah I'm bringing it around. You got this. You can do it. I believe in you.

43:53.080 --> 44:01.160
My grandmother is an old Irish woman who is um resilient so shall we say. You already said old

44:01.160 --> 44:09.000
Irish woman. Yeah so um she texted my cousins and I in our group chat and asked if we could throw

44:09.000 --> 44:20.840
a Christmas rager in her hospital room. Okay. Yeah. I cursed. I'm sorry. And so I just want to know the best

44:20.840 --> 44:25.880
way to pull this off uh without getting us or grandma kicked out of the hospital. Kicked out of the

44:25.880 --> 44:33.560
hospital. I don't know. Wait hold on. Can they kick people out of hospitals for that? Hey you are too

44:33.560 --> 44:41.720
cool. Get out of here. Francis Ford is pretty wild. Uh yeah they can kick you right out of hospital

44:41.720 --> 44:46.840
Travis. You're not granted diplomatic immunity because you're inside of a hospital. But I it's

44:46.840 --> 44:53.160
hard to make sure the dean of the hospital. You don't understand. Hospital official she's sick.

44:53.160 --> 45:00.520
Okay and she wants to have a party. There we go. There's some more lights. Uh yeah um you're gonna

45:00.520 --> 45:13.960
need some IV bags full of vodka. Or gin. Yeah or White Claw. Or Bloody Mary. Probably not the Bloody

45:13.960 --> 45:19.000
Mary. Probably not the Bloody Mary. It looks like blood. That would be fun. You're right that would be fun

45:19.000 --> 45:24.120
Trav. Yeah that you're right Trav. Don't no don't put it in your arm. Don't put any of them in your

45:24.120 --> 45:30.360
arm. Oh my gosh. Listen do everybody got they got the hospital booties? Get a little like old-time

45:30.360 --> 45:35.240
rock and roll like slide like dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun. That's good. Like in risky business and you slide

45:35.240 --> 45:44.760
around. Little cups of jello shots. Okay that's good. I mean listen they hospital gowns don't have

45:44.760 --> 45:51.480
hospital gowns don't have backs. You're halfway to a party already. Okay. I've been to a lot of

45:51.480 --> 46:01.160
parties. Rarely do they feature open butt cracks. Maybe I'm going to the wrong parties. Is there a

46:01.160 --> 46:07.080
way and I'll just base this on some of my like party expertise. Is there a way that there could

46:07.080 --> 46:12.040
be a comfortable couch in an entirely different room and a cat that you can just kind of hang out

46:12.040 --> 46:20.840
where where maybe Mario party is happening? Yeah. So last time she got sick I did sneak my cat into

46:20.840 --> 46:26.280
the hospital. All right so my you would you say that my idea has been the only good one so far?

46:27.480 --> 46:31.320
I don't know those little jello the little jello cup shots that's a pretty good one too. So you're

46:31.320 --> 46:39.640
saying that we've helped? You guys have yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Is this close enough to the mic?

46:39.640 --> 46:46.520
If we could get some more cell phone lines over here. Yeah. Oh my god. Oh yeah. You all rule. Thank

46:46.520 --> 46:51.720
you guys so much. I like the people over here holding up their phones. Thank you. Thank you.

46:51.720 --> 46:57.880
Hello. Very sweet. Hello I am Christy. Hi Christy. So for my birthday yesterday I got tickets to

46:57.880 --> 47:03.960
come here. I was very excited. Oh that's so nice. Is the person standing with you with you? Yes this

47:03.960 --> 47:08.120
is my little sister. She's here for emotional support because I'm just so excited right now.

47:08.120 --> 47:15.160
Well all of the under lighting didn't help with Travis's sort of presumption. That was not a

47:15.160 --> 47:22.920
criticism of everybody's lighting job. Yeah I saw you all reach up higher. We'll get an angle. You're too

47:22.920 --> 47:28.520
sweet. Okay. Yeah so on my way here I was really excited and we were listening to Taz. But now

47:28.520 --> 47:33.960
you're disappointed. No I was just swept away by the tapestry that I didn't realize I was

47:33.960 --> 47:41.880
speeding a little bit. Oh no. The adventure Zane does have that effect on you. What would Zane do?

47:42.600 --> 47:49.000
I got pulled over for my first time on the way here. Oh no. By a West Virginia police officer?

47:49.000 --> 47:58.920
No by Ohio. That's why. I'm sorry. Hey listen here's a non-joke. As you're going home tonight

47:58.920 --> 48:07.240
don't speed in Ohio. Yeah you will watch the speed limit go like 55-60, 55-60, 55-60.

48:07.240 --> 48:14.520
There's real laws over there. Over here in West Virginia there is no law about the number of

48:14.520 --> 48:21.400
people riding in the back of a pickup truck. Where in Ohio that number is zero. In West Virginia

48:21.400 --> 48:28.360
this is true. The open container law is it has to be out of the reach of the driver.

48:30.200 --> 48:36.600
So you you as the driver could just sort of play t-rex and just be like.

48:40.920 --> 48:47.080
Anyway tragic we should have this honestly this one's on us we should have warned you. The first

48:47.080 --> 48:54.520
time I ever got pulled over was in Ohio. Wait wait wait what's your question? So um my little

48:54.520 --> 48:59.000
sister's in the car I was freaking out and then I was. Blame it on her. My parents paid for the

48:59.000 --> 49:05.240
tickets to come here how do I get them to pay for the ticket for Christmas? Okay so the first time

49:05.240 --> 49:09.880
I ever got a speeding ticket I was going 15 miles over the speed limit. That's what happened today.

49:11.080 --> 49:16.360
That's what I did today. That's what you did today? Yes and the officer who brought me over said I'm

49:16.360 --> 49:22.120
going to list it as being nine miles because if it's 10 or more it's reckless endangerment. This

49:22.120 --> 49:28.600
guy was not as nice. They said what? He was not as nice and caught me. Oh okay so then I as they

49:28.600 --> 49:34.920
were writing the ticket I called my father Clint McRoy and I told him what happened and he goes

49:34.920 --> 49:41.640
can you talk about of it all the way and I said dad I feel like he's already being pretty nice

49:41.640 --> 49:51.400
and dad said come on and I refused to try to talk the police officer out of it to the disappointment

49:51.400 --> 50:01.720
of my father. Can you get our father to guilt you in the past? No probably not. This is also. Where

50:01.720 --> 50:09.000
are you from? Columbus. Oh you should have known then. Okay so my advice is gonna be don't go to

50:09.000 --> 50:15.240
Ohio anymore and you're fine. That's a real city. That's a real city you should know about cops.

50:18.280 --> 50:24.280
Maybe talk to some police here and see if they get because one time another story about my dad

50:24.280 --> 50:31.400
I got a ticket for expired uh like stickers on my license plate and I had to go to uh city hall

50:31.400 --> 50:42.600
and talk to someone and my dad said and in this tone of voice ask them if they know who we are.

50:43.480 --> 50:51.000
He didn't mean podcast luminaries to be fair. And I did and they did and it was fine.

50:51.000 --> 51:02.680
Wait it worked? Yeah. Oh that's what's wrong with America. So maybe try that. Has your dad been on

51:02.680 --> 51:09.000
radio for 40 years? Is that an option? No. If not you tell him he was they don't know it's radio.

51:09.560 --> 51:19.640
Listen. Yes. Are your parents cool? Pretty much cool yeah. Do they listen to the show? No but

51:19.640 --> 51:25.720
they know of you guys because they listen to you a lot. What are their names? No. Not last names.

51:25.720 --> 51:31.640
First names. So what do you call them? Mom and dad but they go by Mark and Dorie. Hey mom and dad.

51:31.640 --> 51:38.280
Hey mom and dad. It's me Travis. You know if you think how old are you? 19. 19. If you think about

51:38.280 --> 51:49.000
it what's 2.5 dollars a year right no 25 dollars a year. How much was the ticket? 135. Okay that's

51:49.000 --> 51:53.400
not that bad. I was really shocked I thought it was gonna be 300 because I've never been pulled

51:53.400 --> 52:00.520
over before. Okay look in there hey mom and dad look in their eyes that's your baby. Stop it. Hey

52:00.520 --> 52:08.440
no no stick with me on this that's your baby. Are you gonna really make them sweat 135 dollars?

52:08.440 --> 52:15.000
That's like one stub hub ticket to on my brother my brother and me show. That's nothing. I just

52:15.000 --> 52:20.760
feel bad like because my parents pay for this and I just don't have anything. They've paid for everything

52:20.760 --> 52:25.720
up till now. I'll Venmo you. I have a three-year-old can I tell you how much more money than the next one.

52:47.000 --> 52:53.640
Wait did that help? Wait I know it did. Yeah absolutely thank you. This is so beautiful hello. Hi

52:53.640 --> 52:58.840
um I'm Charlie. Hi Charlie. It's a great name. Can you angle the microphone up just a little bit?

53:00.360 --> 53:07.400
That's fine no worries. Jesus. And apologies in advance if like um something doesn't make sense

53:07.400 --> 53:16.440
I just got back from wisdom teeth surgery so. Whoa hey everyone grab the armrests go on. Okay um

53:17.160 --> 53:26.760
so I live on on a farm and my stepmom hikes a lot and um she's gotten this hobby of collecting bones.

53:26.760 --> 53:33.960
Oh a bone collector. Yeah like the documentary. Yeah they're pretty much everywhere in our house

53:33.960 --> 53:38.280
like um our house is decorated in um uh they're scattered throughout the yard because our dogs

53:38.280 --> 53:52.680
get them too. Oh it's a family affair. Are you here to turn her in? Um maybe um I there's also piles

53:52.680 --> 54:04.760
of them on the front porch. Bone piles. Yeah um and as one might see in Castlevania. Yeah um they've

54:04.760 --> 54:09.880
been there for about three years now I asked her once why and she said she was bleaching them but

54:09.880 --> 54:17.320
I feel like after three years they should be bleached. Hey and also that's not a good answer

54:17.320 --> 54:25.000
for why you have bones. That's as if somebody said why you know the only reason to say why I have

54:25.000 --> 54:34.600
bones so I can stand up and move my arms and eat food. Um but I mean basically my question is how

54:34.600 --> 54:41.240
can I get her to take the bones off the porch at least. Well here's the good news if you steal them

54:41.240 --> 54:50.200
um what's she gonna do? Call the police? Good luck with that call. Hey is this the police?

54:50.200 --> 54:58.920
Someone stole my bone. You should make a you should make a bone pit but work real hard on it

54:59.560 --> 55:05.240
and paint it and stuff with good colors. Put that on YouTube. Put up a fun sign and be like I spent

55:05.240 --> 55:11.400
all day making you a bone pit you're not gonna move them to the bone pit? I made this for you.

55:11.400 --> 55:16.520
And then it's kind of a guilt thing that works that works on me. And maybe start signs like 50

55:16.520 --> 55:21.400
miles out like don't miss the bone pit. Don't miss the bone pit it's a tourist attraction I made it.

55:22.920 --> 55:27.480
What else is she saving them for if not for people to see them because if she doesn't want

55:27.480 --> 55:33.400
people to see them she killed those things. Well I would assume she does want people to see them

55:33.400 --> 55:37.480
because they're like all over our house and she's not exactly hiding them on the porch there just

55:37.480 --> 55:46.120
have piles next to the door. When no one's coming you have to get the word out. Okay. If in the Texas

55:46.120 --> 55:54.600
Chainsaw Massacre. The documentary. The documentary. If the teens had rolled up to the house and there

55:54.600 --> 56:03.560
had been an affable guide who was like look at all my great bones. I don't think the bones would

56:03.560 --> 56:11.160
be very scary. Sure. I think we're all putting a lot of stigma on these bones. So what Griffin is

56:11.160 --> 56:18.120
saying is it's not a problem at all. Apparently it's not a problem. The problem is branding.

56:18.120 --> 56:28.680
Yes. Yes. So maybe if you got on board with it. Maybe the problem is with you. If you petition

56:29.640 --> 56:38.840
the Department of Transportation to put up an official sign on the highway advertising the bone

56:38.840 --> 56:50.280
zone. Now it's fun. Now it's a money maker. Hello. Does that help? Yes it does. Thank you so much.

56:53.080 --> 56:57.560
I need I need my fireflies. We're gonna help you extremely quickly because we're running out of

56:57.560 --> 57:16.840
time. Hi. I appreciate it a lot. I'm Logan. She her. So I like getting gifts that I know that

57:16.840 --> 57:22.920
people are going to use and that people can like use like over time and stuff. So would it be like

57:22.920 --> 57:29.480
entirely too inappropriate to get my roommate cleaning supplies for Christmas?

57:32.040 --> 57:40.120
There. Logan. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. 10 seconds. Why is it a good idea to do this thing? Because

57:40.120 --> 57:46.360
I feel like it could save a lot of time. You know busy people. Hey Logan is there any sort of

57:46.360 --> 57:54.200
little bit of like a kind of slight hint of maybe you could use these around the house? Well anyone

57:54.200 --> 58:04.600
could. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Is there maybe like are these maybe like shade brand? Like you're kind of

58:04.600 --> 58:08.920
throwing a little bit. So I was thinking of like those like I don't know. Okay. So those litter

58:08.920 --> 58:13.000
boxes that I've seen online for years that are like the there's like a top layer that you can

58:13.000 --> 58:19.720
like like sit it out and then just like toss it. Logan they don't do it do they? They don't clean

58:19.720 --> 58:31.080
it out very much do they? Logan. Okay that might cut out. Thank you so much Logan. Thank you.

58:31.880 --> 58:40.760
Logan. Logan. Do it. Just do it. It'll be weird for a while but they might appreciate. At least

58:40.760 --> 58:48.920
you're given the greatest gift which is a story of why they moved out. Does that help? It does.

58:48.920 --> 58:55.080
Thank you. Thank you so much. Okay you can go ahead and lower the house lights down. Thank you. Thank

58:55.080 --> 59:05.320
you so much. Oh that's brighter. The other way. Grab the knob. Okay. Yeah. So I have this is so

59:05.320 --> 59:13.400
cool. I'm really excited. So tonight's event is a a benefit. This is the sad part of the show is

59:13.400 --> 59:22.680
we're going to tell you don't make any money. And there's. I lost money on this show because I bought

59:22.680 --> 59:29.960
this sweater. There's so many and it seemed like a good idea but then there are so many of you here

59:29.960 --> 59:34.600
that it started to feel a little bit like hubris. The good part of that though is that tonight's

59:34.600 --> 59:41.720
event is a fundraiser for Harmony House which seeks to help non-sheltered people in our community.

59:41.720 --> 59:45.480
Are there any reps from Harmony House here? Any Harmony House folks in the audience?

59:48.360 --> 59:53.880
Hey. Thank you. So I've got some good news for y'all.

59:56.600 --> 59:59.560
Actually Harmony House folks do you want to stand up so everybody can give you another round of

59:59.560 --> 01:00:12.440
applause because you do amazing work? Okay. So we have friends at a company called Me Undies and I

01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:19.400
know that underwear is always a need for y'all. Our good friends at Me Undies have donated 200

01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:26.520
pairs of underwear. They have sent to. Well it's in a box at my house but when Sydney comes to work

01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:31.800
I'll have her bring it. But so that thank you so much to Me Undies. That's super cool if they

01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:38.680
read another round of applause for Me Undies. That's great. So here's the here's the even more

01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:46.360
exciting news. The folks here have bought tickets. They've bought posters. They got fired by my

01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:55.640
father-in-law. A service I received for free. They donated and not counting what everyone is going

01:00:55.640 --> 01:01:03.080
to go out and spend on posters and what have you after this. We are going to be able to donate to

01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:22.360
Harmony House 43,355 dollars. So that is cool. And here's the thing that I cannot stress enough.

01:01:22.360 --> 01:01:31.480
When we say we, we mean we. Yeah all of us. It is through you all that this is done and this is what

01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:37.960
our seventh. Hundreds. Yeah we've done a lot of candlelights in every year whether it's through

01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:47.000
the Candlelight Show or NBNBN Angels or whatever. You all have continuously blown us away by your

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:51.320
generosity and your willingness to support our hometown and the people here who need help.

01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:57.800
And I don't have words for it. Thank you so much. Give yourselves another big round of applause.

01:01:57.800 --> 01:02:02.680
We can lower the lights now. That's great. Harmony House you all do amazing work. Thank you

01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:07.800
so much for everything you do. Are we about ready to wrap up? Yes thank you. And we we also want to

01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:14.680
say real quick we couldn't do this show without Paul Seborin. Oh yes yeah yeah yeah. You can all

01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:18.040
go ahead and take the house lights out. It's extremely distracting. Amanda who helped put

01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:25.240
the show together. All the Smurls. Yes. Wait thank you to the Heart Choose Joy players.

01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:31.160
They sang for us. The Ushers, the Kalers, Levi Kelly, Michael Meadows, and Joe Eddins helped

01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:37.560
make the stage amazing. The all the performers in the Soul Bones Show. Thank you so much to all of

01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:41.560
you. Wonderful. Thanks to Dwight Slappy who immediately after his role was complete went

01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:49.480
to the bar across the street to watch the Bills game. Dwight still buffering. Still buffering.

01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:58.440
Let's hear it for Wonderful. Let's hear for the Keith Albee. The Keith Albee amazing beautiful

01:02:58.440 --> 01:03:04.600
venue. The city of Huntington. Another big round of applause because she worked so hard. My mother-in-law

01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:09.960
Mary Smurl made this all this happen. She's amazing. Thank you to John Roderick and the

01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:13.000
Longwinters for these four theme songs instead of Bartroff the album putting the days to bed and

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:18.840
also I guess Jimmy Buffett because there's been quite a bit. I also want a huge round of applause

01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:22.040
for our dad Clint McElroy. Clint McElroy ladies and gentlemen.

01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:27.800
All right time to wrap up.

01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:35.640
Everybody come on up to the microphones. Please don't be shy. We're all family here. Nobody's

01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:48.120
moving. Let's just start playing. Just give me like a one two three four. Nibbling on sponge cake.

01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:57.000
Everybody. Watching the sun bake. All of the tour is covered with oil.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:06.280
Strumming my six string. Now on my front porch swing.

01:04:08.360 --> 01:04:14.760
Smell those shrimp they're beginning to boil. Bubble bubble bubble bubble. Everybody.

01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:26.040
Whisting away again in Margaritaville. Searching for my lost shaker of salt.

01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:36.920
Salt salt salt. Some people claim that there's a woman to blame but I know

01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:46.520
it's my own dang fault. Justin take a verse. I don't know the reason

01:04:48.520 --> 01:04:50.280
I stayed here all season.

01:04:50.280 --> 01:05:09.960
But it's a real beauty. A Mexican beauty. How it got here I haven't a clue.

01:05:09.960 --> 01:05:18.120
Wasting away again in Margaritaville.

01:05:21.480 --> 01:05:25.080
Searching for my lost shaker of salt.

01:05:29.240 --> 01:05:35.960
Some people claim that there's a woman to blame but I know

01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:43.160
it's my own dang fault. Third verse I guess.

01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:49.400
Threw out my flip-flop. There we go. Stepped on a pop top.

01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:54.760
Cut my heel had to cruise on back home.

01:05:54.760 --> 01:06:04.040
You know these words. But there's booze in the blender and soon it will render.

01:06:05.800 --> 01:06:09.080
That frozen concoction that helps me hang on.

01:06:10.120 --> 01:06:12.120
Y'all know the chorus. Sing the chorus.

01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:24.440
Wasting away again in Margaritaville. Searching for my lost shaker of salt.

01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:35.400
Some people claim that there's a woman to blame but I know

01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:42.280
it's my own damn fault. One more chorus I think. Yeah one more everybody let me hear you.

01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:49.960
Wasting away again in Margaritaville. Griffin drop out the guitar let's just hear it.

01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:57.160
Searching for my lost shaker of salt. Salt salt salt.

01:06:57.160 --> 01:07:08.920
Some people claim that there's a woman to blame but I know it's my own damn fault.

01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:14.760
Everybody thank you so much for coming to Canada. I swear to 19. Drive home safely.

01:07:14.760 --> 01:07:28.520
Thank you. Thank you. And kiss your dad's square on the lips. Say bye-bye. Bye-bye. Say bye-bye.

01:07:44.760 --> 01:07:45.260
you
