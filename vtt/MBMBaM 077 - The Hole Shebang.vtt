WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.400
I've saved this tiny green apple to eat during the show.

00:03.400 --> 00:08.920
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:08.920 --> 00:14.240
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:14.240 --> 00:19.760
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how

00:19.760 --> 00:21.760
cool they are for listening.

00:21.760 --> 00:22.760
What's up, you cool baby?

00:22.760 --> 00:48.280
Cut a

00:48.280 --> 00:51.400
hole in some sheets.

00:51.400 --> 00:58.920
Cut holes in a sheet, candy an apple, bob it, and get ready.

00:58.920 --> 00:59.920
It's H-time.

00:59.920 --> 01:05.320
I don't think you can bob for an apple once it's been candied.

01:05.320 --> 01:07.840
Yeah, they're super buoyant.

01:07.840 --> 01:10.400
You push it down far enough it'll rock it through your ceiling.

01:10.400 --> 01:16.320
I'm saying the rich caramelly exterior is going to wash right off once doused in water.

01:16.320 --> 01:20.920
I feel like maybe we should put a limit on the amount of holes one is going to cut in

01:20.920 --> 01:21.920
a sheet.

01:21.920 --> 01:22.920
Just some holes.

01:22.920 --> 01:23.920
What is it?

01:23.920 --> 01:24.920
Three?

01:24.920 --> 01:25.920
Four?

01:25.920 --> 01:26.920
Twelve?

01:26.920 --> 01:30.520
I think you've got to have two for the peepers and one for the penis.

01:30.520 --> 01:33.160
That's my thing.

01:33.160 --> 01:34.160
That is a spooky ghost.

01:34.160 --> 01:35.160
You're going as a horny ghost.

01:35.160 --> 01:36.160
Yeah.

01:36.160 --> 01:37.160
They aren't all ghosts.

01:37.160 --> 01:38.880
Yeah, because they can't.

01:38.880 --> 01:39.880
Well, you know.

01:39.880 --> 01:41.960
They have to watch everybody having sex.

01:41.960 --> 01:46.560
This is My Brother, My Brother, Me, an advice show and Halloween prep show for the modern

01:46.560 --> 01:47.560
era.

01:47.560 --> 01:49.280
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

01:49.280 --> 01:51.160
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

01:51.160 --> 01:52.640
I'm your baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

01:52.640 --> 01:57.520
Do you think we should just start adding to that disclaimer, the advice show for the

01:57.520 --> 02:02.200
modern era, and also a show about ghosts that love to fuck?

02:02.200 --> 02:04.960
Because that's pretty much all we talk about anymore.

02:04.960 --> 02:10.200
Can you imagine if we destroyed a horse and it turned into a ghost that loved to fuck?

02:10.200 --> 02:12.720
That would be like what our whole show is.

02:12.720 --> 02:13.720
Yeah.

02:13.720 --> 02:17.040
Hey, by the way, if you haven't had your Halloween costume planned yet, there it is.

02:17.040 --> 02:18.040
It's right there.

02:18.040 --> 02:20.720
You're a dead ghost horny horse.

02:20.720 --> 02:23.000
You'll be the only one at the party, I guarantee.

02:23.000 --> 02:26.360
All you need is a friend who is a good sport.

02:26.360 --> 02:27.360
Yeah.

02:27.360 --> 02:32.280
Did you guys ever read that old comic strip, Casper the Overly Friendly Ghost?

02:32.280 --> 02:36.140
I loved that one, until it got canceled, and thanks, McCarthy.

02:36.140 --> 02:37.140
Thanks for nothing.

02:37.140 --> 02:39.520
Do you guys have your costumes planned?

02:39.520 --> 02:40.520
Yeah.

02:40.520 --> 02:41.520
You know what you're doing.

02:41.520 --> 02:42.520
Yeah.

02:42.520 --> 02:45.560
I mean, this is our Halloween prep show.

02:45.560 --> 02:47.120
This seems like the time to talk about it.

02:47.120 --> 02:50.000
I'm going to go as Freezer Gaddafi.

02:50.000 --> 02:56.480
I'm post-street murder, currently housed in a freezer while the people decide what

02:56.480 --> 02:58.280
to do for my body.

02:58.280 --> 03:02.360
My whole line is going to be, it's never been this chilly in Libya.

03:02.360 --> 03:03.360
Yeah.

03:03.360 --> 03:04.360
That's my line, I think.

03:04.360 --> 03:05.360
That's your whole goof?

03:05.360 --> 03:06.920
That's a pretty good line.

03:06.920 --> 03:07.920
I made a Gaddafi goof.

03:07.920 --> 03:12.240
Remember before, it's Libya, but it's chilly.

03:12.240 --> 03:16.840
I made a Gaddafi goof yesterday, and somebody was like, whoa, man.

03:16.840 --> 03:19.680
The shit's still, that wound is still fresh.

03:19.680 --> 03:20.680
It's like, really?

03:20.680 --> 03:21.680
Really?

03:21.680 --> 03:22.680
Fuck that guy.

03:22.680 --> 03:23.680
Him?

03:23.680 --> 03:24.680
Fuck that guy.

03:24.680 --> 03:25.680
Fuck that fool.

03:25.680 --> 03:26.680
I hate him.

03:26.680 --> 03:27.680
Fuck that guy.

03:27.680 --> 03:29.320
I don't even know what he did, but I know I'm supposed to hate him, so there.

03:29.320 --> 03:30.320
Yeah.

03:30.320 --> 03:34.320
I think he wore outlandish shirts and terrorized an entire nation.

03:34.320 --> 03:35.320
Okay.

03:35.320 --> 03:36.320
Which is the less crime.

03:36.320 --> 03:37.320
Both of those.

03:37.320 --> 03:38.320
Stacey and Clinton.

03:38.320 --> 03:39.320
Yeah, I don't know.

03:39.320 --> 03:44.120
Hey, every so often, my wife or I will lend a small amount of money to a friend, usually

03:44.120 --> 03:45.120
small, like $20.

03:45.120 --> 03:50.720
The problem is that sometimes these different friends try to repay us in gifts instead of

03:50.720 --> 03:52.680
hard cash money.

03:52.680 --> 03:57.440
For example, they'll suggest buying me coffee or a bottle of wine to service the debt.

03:57.440 --> 04:01.880
I've even had a friend add me to his Costco membership and then propose that it counts

04:01.880 --> 04:04.840
as repayment.

04:04.840 --> 04:08.480
These friends aren't in the poorhouse and have the cash on hand.

04:08.480 --> 04:13.420
Should I take these alternative gifts graciously or be firm and require money?

04:13.420 --> 04:16.280
That's from vexed in Vancouver.

04:16.280 --> 04:22.840
Who needs an amount of money that is under $20?

04:22.840 --> 04:26.240
If you just wait, you'll make $20.

04:26.240 --> 04:28.640
Just chill out and somebody will give it to you.

04:28.640 --> 04:30.400
Money is so boring.

04:30.400 --> 04:31.960
Money is just...

04:31.960 --> 04:36.400
It's great to get paper, but once you get that paper, it's just paper.

04:36.400 --> 04:37.440
You can't do anything with it.

04:37.440 --> 04:41.760
You're basically having your friends go out and buy you exciting things, like a Costco

04:41.760 --> 04:42.760
membership.

04:42.760 --> 04:44.480
It's not worth its weight in gold, but it's not that heavy.

04:44.480 --> 04:49.520
The additional details of this, though, where he said the problem is that what they spend

04:49.520 --> 04:52.720
the money on is not things he would normally spend money on.

04:52.720 --> 04:53.780
That's not a problem.

04:53.780 --> 04:55.160
That's an awesome.

04:55.160 --> 04:56.160
That's the opposite of a problem.

04:56.160 --> 04:57.160
Right.

04:57.160 --> 04:59.880
A Costco membership is the sort of thing that you tell yourself you're going to get, but

04:59.880 --> 05:03.840
no one really knows how to get them or what counter to go to.

05:03.840 --> 05:08.000
You'll go there and you might ask the wrong person.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.480
Then they're like, you're at a blockbuster.

05:09.480 --> 05:11.080
What are you talking about?

05:11.080 --> 05:13.160
They're like, blockbuster clothes.

05:13.160 --> 05:18.840
What they should do is add all of his friends to the Costco membership and then demand that

05:18.840 --> 05:22.920
whenever he loans them a trivial amount of cash like this, that they should repay him

05:22.920 --> 05:29.600
in something from Costco, such as a four-pound bucket of gummy worms or something.

05:29.600 --> 05:31.800
I got you this industrial-sized silly putty.

05:31.800 --> 05:36.280
Hey, man, I hope you like Ferrero Rocher because here's a pyramid.

05:36.280 --> 05:37.280
I heard you like crybabies.

05:37.280 --> 05:39.040
I got you a bucket.

05:39.040 --> 05:40.040
Chew on this.

05:40.040 --> 05:44.160
Yeah, you know that candy that you haven't had in 13 years?

05:44.160 --> 05:45.160
They've been-

05:45.160 --> 05:46.160
Do you remember tearjerkers?

05:46.160 --> 05:47.160
I got you some tearjerkers.

05:47.160 --> 05:49.040
They've been stopped buying them at Costco.

05:49.040 --> 05:50.040
Here's a whole barrel.

05:50.040 --> 05:54.600
I really did have a bucket of... That's the one thing I've ever bought at Sam's, a bucket

05:54.600 --> 05:55.600
of crybabies.

05:55.600 --> 05:56.600
I used to be all about that.

05:56.600 --> 05:59.520
I bought a bag at H-E-B last week.

05:59.520 --> 06:00.520
Did you?

06:00.520 --> 06:02.600
They're good for... Here's what a lot of people don't recognize.

06:02.600 --> 06:05.160
They have such therapeutic qualities.

06:05.160 --> 06:08.960
If you have a sore throat or you're stuffed up, pop a crybaby in there.

06:08.960 --> 06:10.560
The sour will make it go away.

06:10.560 --> 06:12.080
That's free advice from us to you.

06:12.080 --> 06:13.080
Free advice from me.

06:13.080 --> 06:15.000
Tea is for bitches.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.440
Real nice, you crybabies.

06:16.440 --> 06:21.920
I think that the problem with this whole situation that he's running into is I think it's different

06:21.920 --> 06:28.880
if your friends say, would you rather have a bottle of wine or that $12 I owe you?

06:28.880 --> 06:31.400
They're just going, I got you this wine to pay you back.

06:31.400 --> 06:34.280
That wasn't the arrangement, bitch.

06:34.280 --> 06:38.160
I hate buying wine though, so 100% of the time I'm going to go with the wine.

06:38.160 --> 06:40.680
Yeah, but then it's an awesome game show friendship.

06:40.680 --> 06:41.680
Yeah.

06:41.680 --> 06:42.680
Oh, right.

06:42.680 --> 06:45.680
You could have Wes behind door number one or you could take the cash.

06:45.680 --> 06:46.680
This is great.

06:46.680 --> 06:48.520
This is a great thing though.

06:48.520 --> 06:51.560
I'm excited about this.

06:51.560 --> 06:56.600
The cool play is to wait till your friend borrows money, pays you back with a bottle

06:56.600 --> 07:01.040
of wine, and then the next time they hit you up for money, you give them that same bottle

07:01.040 --> 07:02.040
of wine back.

07:02.040 --> 07:03.040
I say, that's bartering.

07:03.040 --> 07:06.600
Oh, I thought this was the economy we were in.

07:06.600 --> 07:08.680
I thought we were in a wine economy.

07:08.680 --> 07:11.360
What kind of relationship do these people have with their friends?

07:11.360 --> 07:14.720
They're like, ah, man, I need $16.

07:14.720 --> 07:17.040
Better go get Jerry.

07:17.040 --> 07:19.080
I am not the town ATM.

07:19.080 --> 07:20.080
They have money.

07:20.080 --> 07:23.560
Why are they borrowing money from their friends?

07:23.560 --> 07:24.560
Nobody needs six.

07:24.560 --> 07:25.560
This is what I'm saying to you.

07:25.560 --> 07:27.160
This is the bigger problem I have.

07:27.160 --> 07:30.240
No one needs less than $20.

07:30.240 --> 07:32.020
Nothing costs that.

07:32.020 --> 07:33.020
Nothing costs less than $20.

07:33.020 --> 07:35.680
Just stop going with your friends to the dollar store.

07:35.680 --> 07:41.120
Right, like, hey, listen, I just parked outside your house, and the parking meter is going

07:41.120 --> 07:43.480
to cost me like $8.

07:43.480 --> 07:45.720
Can you hit me up?

07:45.720 --> 07:46.720
You should have walked.

07:46.720 --> 07:48.880
You shouldn't have driven.

07:48.880 --> 07:51.600
Maybe a movie ticket, but even then, there's an argument.

07:51.600 --> 07:54.680
But why would you go to the movies and not bring money?

07:54.680 --> 07:55.680
That's an important question.

07:55.680 --> 08:00.000
See, and I also kind of feel like if you pay for a ticket for your friends to the movie,

08:00.000 --> 08:01.520
here's what I'm having a problem with.

08:01.520 --> 08:09.000
Maybe this is just because I'm living, I'm in the 82%, so I'm living an affluent lifestyle,

08:09.000 --> 08:18.280
but I kind of feel like anything under $20 is almost like a gift you're doing anyway.

08:18.280 --> 08:23.320
I wouldn't think of that as like a, I did this nice thing for you because I gave you

08:23.320 --> 08:24.320
$20.

08:24.320 --> 08:28.920
I'd be like, oh, I got to do something nice and help you out and give you.

08:28.920 --> 08:32.880
The way I look at it karmically is over all the times of my life that I've bummed money

08:32.880 --> 08:37.040
off people for things, now I'm karmically paying that back by being like, no, I got

08:37.040 --> 08:38.040
it.

08:38.040 --> 08:39.040
Don't worry about it.

08:39.040 --> 08:40.040
I got it.

08:40.040 --> 08:44.200
See, in my head, I have a tiny bookkeeper with a green visor and one of those receipt

08:44.200 --> 08:49.180
machines that just like the receipts fly into the air karmically, and I have a running

08:49.180 --> 08:54.500
tally of exactly how much money everybody owes me all the time, and I'm not miserly

08:54.500 --> 08:55.500
about it.

08:55.500 --> 09:01.080
I don't want to go after those people, but Travis, you owe me $364.

09:01.080 --> 09:02.080
I believe that.

09:02.080 --> 09:09.600
Justin, you and I are totally even, which is nice, but I mean, all of my friends, like

09:09.600 --> 09:15.320
Stu, Stu owes me $455, and I'm never going to forget about that.

09:15.320 --> 09:16.320
Ever.

09:16.320 --> 09:17.320
Ever.

09:17.320 --> 09:18.320
Stu.

09:18.320 --> 09:19.320
That's classic Stu though.

09:19.320 --> 09:22.120
God forbid something happens to Stu and you never see that money.

09:22.120 --> 09:27.480
Oh, I have already lost a lot of funds, unrecoverable funds.

09:27.480 --> 09:29.800
Gaddafi I drew 20 spot.

09:29.800 --> 09:30.800
Gaddafi?

09:30.800 --> 09:31.800
That fool owed me $12.

09:31.800 --> 09:32.800
$12 whole dollars.

09:32.800 --> 09:33.800
He was like, Griffin.

09:33.800 --> 09:37.360
He sent you a bottle of wine, and you're like, no Gaddafi.

09:37.360 --> 09:39.440
Griffin, can I get a scarf?

09:39.440 --> 09:40.440
It's so chilly in Libya.

09:40.440 --> 09:41.440
Give me a $12 scarf.

09:41.440 --> 09:42.440
And you're like.

09:42.440 --> 09:47.840
Well, we were hitting up the bars on 36, and he was like, oh man, I left my wallet at home.

09:47.840 --> 09:49.880
I was like, Gaddafi, I got you.

09:49.880 --> 09:50.880
And I did got him.

09:50.880 --> 09:51.880
And then you know what happened?

09:51.880 --> 09:53.360
He went and got himself killed.

09:53.360 --> 09:54.920
Thanks Gaddafi for nothing.

09:54.920 --> 09:55.920
Yeah.

09:55.920 --> 09:58.200
And all that full drink is buttery nipples.

09:58.200 --> 09:59.200
Yep.

09:59.200 --> 10:02.600
And so you know it's going to be a pricey night.

10:02.600 --> 10:09.520
My serious advice to you is that you don't accept the money and you don't accept the

10:09.520 --> 10:12.120
gifts and you make them live with that.

10:12.120 --> 10:16.320
You make them live with that debt and you cash it in when you are ready.

10:16.320 --> 10:23.720
Make everyone you know live in constant feeling of being indebted to you.

10:23.720 --> 10:27.280
That's going to be a hard policy to reverse though, because they know that they can come

10:27.280 --> 10:30.040
to you with a bottle of wine and you say, okay, we cool.

10:30.040 --> 10:32.760
So the next time they come to you with a bottle of wine, it's going to be tough for you to

10:32.760 --> 10:33.760
be like, nope.

10:33.760 --> 10:35.320
No, I think you'd do exactly that.

10:35.320 --> 10:37.240
Hey, I got you this bottle of wine.

10:37.240 --> 10:39.600
No, no, that is not dollars.

10:39.600 --> 10:40.600
I cannot spend that.

10:40.600 --> 10:41.600
And you turn and walk away.

10:41.600 --> 10:42.600
In this economy.

10:42.600 --> 10:46.240
No, you got to go so hyper polite.

10:46.240 --> 10:49.940
It's got to be like, no, no, no, I can't accept this.

10:49.940 --> 10:53.860
It was a gift from me to you and then you just let make them live with it.

10:53.860 --> 10:57.160
It's the most sort of hostile generosity you can muster.

10:57.160 --> 11:02.600
If it's a small thing, if they're like, here's some, here's a can of Planner's Peanuts.

11:02.600 --> 11:06.720
It was $2 at H-E-B. You can't be like, no, no, no.

11:06.720 --> 11:08.520
That dollar, that money is a gift.

11:08.520 --> 11:09.960
It's fucking peanuts.

11:09.960 --> 11:12.000
You need to calm down.

11:12.000 --> 11:16.960
What if you set up like a Godfather-esque kind of friendship economy where you're like,

11:16.960 --> 11:21.560
no, no, no, but there will come a time when I will call on you for those Planner's Peanuts.

11:21.560 --> 11:24.360
Hey, you know, Stu, I need you to fucking murder him.

11:24.360 --> 11:27.360
It's like, dude, you gave me $13.

11:27.360 --> 11:30.280
I'm not going to murder Stu for that.

11:30.280 --> 11:37.960
Maybe they come to you, they say, hey, I know I owed you $10, but I got you this jar of

11:37.960 --> 11:38.960
peanuts.

11:38.960 --> 11:44.640
You turn it up and dump the peanuts out in front of them and say, with juice, it's $12.

11:44.640 --> 11:47.640
I'll see you in a week.

11:47.640 --> 11:48.640
You got to put the juice on.

11:48.640 --> 11:49.840
That's the problem.

11:49.840 --> 11:53.240
What peanut is that?

11:53.240 --> 11:55.800
You got to put the juice on because a lot of people will loan you.

11:55.800 --> 11:56.800
You got to get the juice on.

11:56.800 --> 11:57.800
A lot of people will loan you.

11:57.800 --> 11:58.800
You better go to Walgreens.

11:58.800 --> 11:59.800
No juice.

11:59.800 --> 12:00.800
You better buy me a can.

12:00.800 --> 12:04.440
Buy me a can of emerald nuts with the chili lime sauce on them.

12:04.440 --> 12:06.240
That damn will be cool.

12:06.240 --> 12:07.380
Hold on real quick.

12:07.380 --> 12:10.760
Just to clarify, Justin, you're saying that when you loan your friends a small amount

12:10.760 --> 12:15.280
of money, you got to charge a really high interest, like a 150% loan?

12:15.280 --> 12:16.280
Yes.

12:16.280 --> 12:17.880
The smaller the amount, the more juice.

12:17.880 --> 12:21.560
If you borrow $2, tomorrow you'll owe me $6.

12:21.560 --> 12:27.160
If I loan someone a dollar and later they try to hand me a grubby piece of paper that

12:27.160 --> 12:30.280
has one written on it, I will tear it in half in front of them.

12:30.280 --> 12:33.160
What am I going to do with $1?

12:33.160 --> 12:36.920
I'm not the sort of person that accepts $1 bills from people.

12:36.920 --> 12:39.920
That's your department.

12:39.920 --> 12:40.920
Have you noticed that?

12:40.920 --> 12:41.920
I'm not the poor one.

12:41.920 --> 12:46.920
You're the poor one.

12:46.920 --> 12:49.520
What am I going to do with a dollar?

12:49.520 --> 12:51.200
Do I look poor?

12:51.200 --> 12:52.200
I'm rich as shit.

12:52.200 --> 12:53.200
I'm the bank.

12:53.200 --> 12:55.360
I've got dollars all over the place.

12:55.360 --> 12:58.680
I thought you sneezed and needed something to blow your nose into.

12:58.680 --> 13:03.680
Oh, this is a confetti in front of a shitty party.

13:03.680 --> 13:05.680
That's the only thing I could do with this right now.

13:05.680 --> 13:09.400
Give me a dollar, keep it.

13:09.400 --> 13:13.600
If you are going to borrow money from a friend and you are going to pay them back with cold,

13:13.600 --> 13:16.920
hard bills, make sure they're not grubby.

13:16.920 --> 13:18.960
Make sure they're not dirty bills.

13:18.960 --> 13:22.960
If they can't go through a soda machine, I'm not interested.

13:22.960 --> 13:25.320
I'm not even talking about the relative crispness.

13:25.320 --> 13:29.440
I'm talking about bills that look like you got it from a cashier and you're like, oh,

13:29.440 --> 13:30.440
cool.

13:30.440 --> 13:31.440
I'm going to keep this right in my butt.

13:31.440 --> 13:34.600
I'm going to put this right between my cheeks and keep it there for a while.

13:34.600 --> 13:38.040
Why did you put this bill in between your cheeks?

13:38.040 --> 13:40.280
And then you give that bill to other people.

13:40.280 --> 13:41.280
That's nature's wallet.

13:41.280 --> 13:44.760
Cash is so gross.

13:44.760 --> 13:48.680
If God didn't want us to put dollar bills in our butts, he would not have left a slot

13:48.680 --> 13:49.680
there.

13:49.680 --> 13:50.680
That's what I'm saying.

13:50.680 --> 13:52.960
Don't talk about the change first.

13:52.960 --> 13:53.960
Nature versus nurture.

13:53.960 --> 13:56.680
Hey, that did not relate.

13:56.680 --> 13:59.200
Nothing in that made sense.

13:59.200 --> 14:04.960
I have a problem with a buddy of mine that I'm hoping you can help me with.

14:04.960 --> 14:07.880
Travis used to be so good about pairing these questions down.

14:07.880 --> 14:08.880
I meant to pair this down.

14:08.880 --> 14:11.480
They're like epic poems now, but okay.

14:11.480 --> 14:16.160
He and his wife gossip so much and I get uncomfortable when neither of our talk to them because of

14:16.160 --> 14:17.160
it.

14:17.160 --> 14:20.280
I was talking to him earlier today and out of nowhere, he brought up something very personal

14:20.280 --> 14:22.840
that his wife had been told in confidence by a mutual friend of ours.

14:22.840 --> 14:27.200
I'm going to talk about a little secret nobody expects that will be kept.

14:27.200 --> 14:32.040
Neither of us have any business knowing it, and I know I'm not the only one he's told.

14:32.040 --> 14:35.960
I've tried to say things like, I don't need to hear this, or that should probably be between

14:35.960 --> 14:41.000
you and your wife and so and so, and he plays it off like it's okay if he's told me as long

14:41.000 --> 14:42.320
as I don't tell anyone else.

14:42.320 --> 14:45.840
I don't usually like being confrontational, but this is the type of thing that I should

14:45.840 --> 14:47.320
be confrontational about.

14:47.320 --> 14:51.120
I don't feel that I'd be out of line going up to his wife and telling her to keep her

14:51.120 --> 14:55.440
mouth shut about these things, but I honestly feel like that wouldn't do any good.

14:55.440 --> 15:00.160
How is someone supposed to handle gossips like my big mouth friend and his even bigger

15:00.160 --> 15:02.080
mouth wife?

15:02.080 --> 15:05.160
Too mad to think of a clever name in Iowa?

15:05.160 --> 15:10.120
Unacceptable excuse, but we will answer your query.

15:10.120 --> 15:15.560
I almost would like to say emergence theory, eventually this will take care of itself,

15:15.560 --> 15:19.560
and all your friends will be like, oh, we shouldn't tell anything to Gossipy Jane and

15:19.560 --> 15:24.080
her Gossipy husband, but really, in real life, people-

15:24.080 --> 15:25.440
I don't know how it works.

15:25.440 --> 15:29.880
Because people want to talk about their problems to whoever will listen.

15:29.880 --> 15:30.880
I think you gotta-

15:30.880 --> 15:31.880
Hence our show.

15:31.880 --> 15:37.400
You gotta give them a lesson.

15:37.400 --> 15:41.640
You gotta treat them to a lesson, like a hard-learned lesson.

15:41.640 --> 15:47.480
Go around and tell everybody about your big mouth buddy, Mike, and you gotta say, oh yeah,

15:47.480 --> 15:53.200
Mike, don't tell anyone, but he's got shingles all over his dick, and just tell it to everybody.

15:53.200 --> 15:56.440
Tell it to every person that you know and see and encounter.

15:56.440 --> 16:00.040
And then, when it gets back to Mike, he'll come to you and be like, hey Dave, what the

16:00.040 --> 16:01.040
fuck?

16:01.040 --> 16:06.560
And you say, now you know how gossip hurts, shingle dick.

16:06.560 --> 16:13.440
I don't see this as a huge problem for you, provided that you don't give these people

16:13.440 --> 16:16.960
any information.

16:16.960 --> 16:18.680
Don't you want this information?

16:18.680 --> 16:22.740
Don't you want to be Lord Varys, the master of whispers?

16:22.740 --> 16:30.680
Don't you want to know all the secrets of the kingdom?

16:30.680 --> 16:39.080
I don't see how, as long as your loose lips don't sink your specific ship, you want to

16:39.080 --> 16:40.760
be able to trade in this information.

16:40.760 --> 16:45.120
So you're saying that he becomes like a vault, just a well of information about everyone

16:45.120 --> 16:46.120
they know.

16:46.120 --> 16:52.120
Right, until that information becomes relevant or valuable to him.

16:52.120 --> 16:56.840
I think the problem, though, is that sometimes you find out the wrong thing, and all of a

16:56.840 --> 16:59.600
sudden you're just laden with this power.

16:59.600 --> 17:03.700
You find out that such and such is cheating on so and so, and you're like, what do I do

17:03.700 --> 17:04.720
with this?

17:04.720 --> 17:09.960
Now I know this thing, and every time I look at them, I know this thing about them.

17:09.960 --> 17:13.180
That can be destructive.

17:13.180 --> 17:14.920
That can ruin a friendship.

17:14.920 --> 17:19.480
And also, this person's going to have to live in fear of his friend's big mouth and his

17:19.480 --> 17:21.460
friend's big mouth wife.

17:21.460 --> 17:24.000
Every time he does something that he doesn't want other people to know about.

17:24.000 --> 17:29.840
Like, oh yeah, he was at his in-laws house and he tooted and nobody heard it, but I know.

17:29.840 --> 17:31.680
I know, and now you know.

17:31.680 --> 17:35.320
Is it a serious enough offense that you could stop being friends with these people?

17:35.320 --> 17:36.880
Because that's sort of where I'm at.

17:36.880 --> 17:39.440
I don't think you could talk someone into being more trustworthy.

17:39.440 --> 17:40.440
No.

17:40.440 --> 17:44.320
I don't think you could say, it hurts my feelings when you're shitty because you're a shitty

17:44.320 --> 17:46.360
person, so please stop it.

17:46.360 --> 17:49.020
Hey, everything about you sucks.

17:49.020 --> 17:50.680
Can you do something about that?

17:50.680 --> 17:51.680
Yeah.

17:51.680 --> 17:54.800
It just seems to me like if someone's sharing these very personal things with them and then

17:54.800 --> 17:59.120
they're going around telling people, they are fundamentally missing the purpose of friendship

17:59.120 --> 18:00.120
and trust.

18:00.120 --> 18:01.120
Yeah.

18:01.120 --> 18:02.120
I mean, it's hard to...

18:02.120 --> 18:03.120
Yeah.

18:03.120 --> 18:07.280
I mean, all you can do is sort of close yourself off to them and stop trusting them, which

18:07.280 --> 18:09.760
is kind of what I was saying before.

18:09.760 --> 18:15.120
You stop giving them your information, and what I would also tell you to do is encourage

18:15.120 --> 18:18.440
other friends you know to stop giving them juice.

18:18.440 --> 18:22.000
And if they ask, like, why aren't you as forthcoming as you used to be, you say, well because you're

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
fucking gossipy.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
Yeah.

18:24.000 --> 18:27.760
And that's sort of like cold, you know, I think it'll have a chilling effect that would

18:27.760 --> 18:29.680
hopefully correct the problem.

18:29.680 --> 18:34.920
And I would say to try to avoid, you know, too big a drama, don't tell your other friends

18:34.920 --> 18:37.120
like, hey, they told me this thing about you.

18:37.120 --> 18:41.900
Say that they're very gossipy about your other friends, just so that you aren't gossiping

18:41.900 --> 18:44.400
about them to other people.

18:44.400 --> 18:45.400
I don't know, guys.

18:45.400 --> 18:48.720
I think you got to keep feeding the beast a little bit, because I feel like the second

18:48.720 --> 18:51.880
you start starving these people like this, they're going to start making shit up.

18:51.880 --> 18:55.640
And then, and then the shoe is really going to be on the other foot.

18:55.640 --> 18:57.320
Are you saying feed them misinformation?

18:57.320 --> 19:01.520
No, I'm saying feed them a little trivial stuff, like the time you tooted at your in-laws

19:01.520 --> 19:06.320
house so that they don't like go around saying like, oh, yeah, Mike got feline AIDS.

19:06.320 --> 19:07.320
Oh, secrecy.

19:07.320 --> 19:08.320
Yeah.

19:08.320 --> 19:09.320
I heard Mike got rickets.

19:09.320 --> 19:11.320
Don't make them quit cold turkey.

19:11.320 --> 19:12.320
Yeah.

19:12.320 --> 19:13.720
You got to, you got to drop them off a little bit.

19:13.720 --> 19:18.720
I don't know why it's got to be some obscure venereal disease that you've got, but that

19:18.720 --> 19:25.880
seems to be like the kind of like the worst kind of information to trade in.

19:25.880 --> 19:28.280
My fingers smell like chlorine.

19:28.280 --> 19:30.920
Don't tell anybody.

19:30.920 --> 19:32.520
You promised.

19:32.520 --> 19:33.520
My socks don't match.

19:33.520 --> 19:34.520
Keep that to yourself.

19:34.520 --> 19:37.520
Do you guys want a Yahoo answer?

19:37.520 --> 19:38.520
Yes, please.

19:38.520 --> 19:39.520
I guess.

19:39.520 --> 19:41.420
I have a few.

19:41.420 --> 19:45.000
This one was sent in by Diego Garcia.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.000
Thank you, Diego.

19:46.000 --> 19:54.600
It's by Yahoo Answers user Lewis, who asks, I have a 20 gauge shotgun and need a nickname

19:54.600 --> 19:56.920
for her.

19:56.920 --> 20:00.560
Don't say Betty Lou or old Yeller.

20:00.560 --> 20:01.560
How about shooty?

20:01.560 --> 20:02.560
Okay.

20:02.560 --> 20:03.560
That's very direct.

20:03.560 --> 20:04.560
Shoot gun.

20:04.560 --> 20:05.560
Shoot gun.

20:05.560 --> 20:06.560
Very literal.

20:06.560 --> 20:07.560
Yeah.

20:07.560 --> 20:08.560
Gunny Gunnarsson.

20:08.560 --> 20:10.560
A very literal name.

20:10.560 --> 20:11.560
You're doing good.

20:11.560 --> 20:12.560
You're so far.

20:12.560 --> 20:13.560
Okay.

20:13.560 --> 20:14.560
Yeah.

20:14.560 --> 20:15.560
What about Gaddafi Slayer?

20:15.560 --> 20:16.560
Whoa.

20:16.560 --> 20:17.560
This is the one.

20:17.560 --> 20:18.560
Okay.

20:18.560 --> 20:22.760
This is the one that brought him down, brought down the big dog.

20:22.760 --> 20:23.760
Yeah.

20:23.760 --> 20:30.240
I went over to Texas and I grabbed him by his stupid collar and I said, listen, Gaddafi,

20:30.240 --> 20:31.240
get out of town.

20:31.240 --> 20:32.240
Get out of here.

20:32.240 --> 20:33.240
Pulled him out of his trailer home.

20:33.240 --> 20:36.000
Punched his mail ticket.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.360
Can't hide in Texas, Gaddafi.

20:37.360 --> 20:39.040
Get out of here.

20:39.040 --> 20:40.840
And he looked incredibly white.

20:40.840 --> 20:41.840
Yeah.

20:41.840 --> 20:42.840
That was weird.

20:42.840 --> 20:44.960
And he was a woman, which was weird.

20:44.960 --> 20:45.960
Yeah.

20:45.960 --> 20:46.960
Yeah.

20:46.960 --> 20:51.200
Um, what about shoot caliber?

20:51.200 --> 20:52.720
Okay.

20:52.720 --> 20:56.400
It's like a medieval thing going on.

20:56.400 --> 20:59.000
Can we call it operation Iraqi freedom?

20:59.000 --> 21:00.000
You can.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
You can.

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
Maybe.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
I like that patriotic angle.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.000
The glittering Eagle.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
It's gotta be something.

21:05.000 --> 21:06.000
It's gotta be something patriotic.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
Right?

21:07.000 --> 21:11.040
It can't be a shotgun, it can't be something like, I like the idea of a girl's name, but

21:11.040 --> 21:13.800
that seems more applicable to like an old automobile.

21:13.800 --> 21:14.800
Yeah.

21:14.800 --> 21:15.800
Or a pistol.

21:15.800 --> 21:19.200
What if you named it Top Gun?

21:19.200 --> 21:21.240
What about red, white, and boom?

21:21.240 --> 21:26.440
Cause that's very, very, your pride is there.

21:26.440 --> 21:28.480
These colors don't fun because-

21:28.480 --> 21:30.440
These colors don't gun?

21:30.440 --> 21:31.920
I'm sorry, Griffin.

21:31.920 --> 21:34.040
Ah, fuck me.

21:34.040 --> 21:35.040
Shit.

21:35.040 --> 21:38.760
Um, how about the only friend I'll ever need?

21:38.760 --> 21:43.760
Uh, what about, uh, second, second amendmenty?

21:43.760 --> 21:48.920
It's kind of a classic personification.

21:48.920 --> 21:55.200
The right to bear harms?

21:55.200 --> 21:56.520
How about Betty Lou?

21:56.520 --> 21:57.520
Damn it.

21:57.520 --> 21:59.520
No, you did a bad job.

21:59.520 --> 22:00.520
Did a bad job.

22:00.520 --> 22:01.520
Hmm.

22:01.520 --> 22:05.280
How about Dracula?

22:05.280 --> 22:10.800
No, this is, okay, this is a vein we need to explore because your gun's name should be

22:10.800 --> 22:11.800
scary.

22:11.800 --> 22:14.840
This is my gun, Wolfman.

22:14.840 --> 22:16.840
This is my gun, Dracula.

22:16.840 --> 22:20.080
This is my gun, The Mummy, starring Brendan Fraser.

22:20.080 --> 22:24.880
How far out of the Universal Monsters over can we go with these gun names?

22:24.880 --> 22:27.800
I mean, can it be the creature from the Black Lagoon, the gun?

22:27.800 --> 22:29.040
I think so.

22:29.040 --> 22:30.720
The creature from the Black Lagoon.

22:30.720 --> 22:31.720
Okay.

22:31.720 --> 22:37.680
Hey, what about Tim Gunn?

22:37.680 --> 22:38.680
That's good and butch.

22:38.680 --> 22:40.480
Yeah, I like that.

22:40.480 --> 22:43.560
Maybe Hot Shots, Hot Shots Part 2.

22:43.560 --> 22:44.560
Maybe.

22:44.560 --> 22:45.560
Okay.

22:45.560 --> 22:47.760
This is my gun, Charlie Sheen.

22:47.760 --> 22:50.200
Charlie Sheen, the gun.

22:50.200 --> 22:53.200
This is my gun, shooting.

22:53.200 --> 22:54.200
Um.

22:54.200 --> 22:56.200
It's my Charlie Sheen impression, everybody.

22:56.200 --> 22:57.200
Oh.

22:57.200 --> 22:59.560
If it's told, I couldn't bust it out.

22:59.560 --> 23:04.080
What about two and a half barrels?

23:04.080 --> 23:05.080
That's not bad.

23:05.080 --> 23:06.080
But it doesn't make sense.

23:06.080 --> 23:07.080
There's only two barrels.

23:07.080 --> 23:08.080
You got to put another half barrel on there.

23:08.080 --> 23:12.200
You got to put a tinier barrel.

23:12.200 --> 23:15.920
So here's some of the suggestions that Yahoo has provided.

23:15.920 --> 23:16.920
Big Mama.

23:16.920 --> 23:17.920
Okay.

23:17.920 --> 23:18.920
No, that's good.

23:18.920 --> 23:19.920
It's got a nice.

23:19.920 --> 23:20.920
Sure.

23:20.920 --> 23:21.920
I guess.

23:21.920 --> 23:22.920
It's got a nice.

23:22.920 --> 23:23.920
Is there another?

23:23.920 --> 23:24.920
Is there a...

23:24.920 --> 23:26.720
What was the Big Mama's house?

23:26.720 --> 23:27.720
Big Mama's gun.

23:27.720 --> 23:28.720
Big Mama's gun.

23:28.720 --> 23:29.720
That's good.

23:29.720 --> 23:30.720
Norbert.

23:30.720 --> 23:32.160
Norbert, the gun.

23:32.160 --> 23:34.400
The wife.

23:34.400 --> 23:35.960
Old Blue, the Terminator.

23:35.960 --> 23:37.600
The apple corer.

23:37.600 --> 23:39.240
Now hold on real quick.

23:39.240 --> 23:40.240
Okay.

23:40.240 --> 23:41.240
Brother said not Old Yeller.

23:41.240 --> 23:42.240
Yeah.

23:42.240 --> 23:44.280
And so other dudes just went for a different color.

23:44.280 --> 23:45.280
Shiloh.

23:45.280 --> 23:46.280
Greeny.

23:46.280 --> 23:47.280
Um.

23:47.280 --> 23:49.840
Something for an old dog that's near death.

23:49.840 --> 23:50.840
What?

23:50.840 --> 23:51.840
It's a good dog name.

23:51.840 --> 23:53.840
It's a good gun name.

23:53.840 --> 23:55.920
Oh, okay.

23:55.920 --> 23:58.560
I thought you were saying that was the name of the gun.

23:58.560 --> 24:00.400
It's for an old dog that's near death.

24:00.400 --> 24:01.400
Trust me.

24:01.400 --> 24:02.400
No.

24:02.400 --> 24:03.400
No.

24:03.400 --> 24:04.400
Um.

24:04.400 --> 24:05.400
Stacy or Jeff.

24:05.400 --> 24:06.400
Mrs. Bangbang.

24:06.400 --> 24:07.400
Baby sister.

24:07.400 --> 24:08.400
Baby sister.

24:08.400 --> 24:09.400
Irene.

24:09.400 --> 24:10.400
Grace.

24:10.400 --> 24:15.120
I call mine the 20 gauge.

24:15.120 --> 24:17.320
The shotgun is yet to complain about it.

24:17.320 --> 24:18.320
Okay.

24:18.320 --> 24:19.320
Wait.

24:19.320 --> 24:20.320
What?

24:20.320 --> 24:21.320
Hold on.

24:21.320 --> 24:22.320
So you didn't come up with the name.

24:22.320 --> 24:23.320
Is that what he means?

24:23.320 --> 24:24.320
He just calls it what the gun is.

24:24.320 --> 24:25.320
Okay.

24:25.320 --> 24:27.320
And the shotgun hasn't protested so far.

24:27.320 --> 24:28.320
Um.

24:28.320 --> 24:29.320
Vern.

24:29.320 --> 24:31.960
Oh, Jesus Christ.

24:31.960 --> 24:33.600
Blood first, then a name.

24:33.600 --> 24:38.080
A gun earns its name when you make your first kill with it.

24:38.080 --> 24:39.080
Oh no.

24:39.080 --> 24:40.880
This is, this is my gun.

24:40.880 --> 24:44.880
Accidental family tragedy.

24:44.880 --> 24:47.020
I really wish I'd named it before.

24:47.020 --> 24:48.020
This is my gun.

24:48.020 --> 24:52.080
Take that uppity bus driver.

24:52.080 --> 24:53.080
This is my gun.

24:53.080 --> 24:54.080
Nirvana ruiner.

24:54.080 --> 24:57.560
Oh no, oh no.

24:57.560 --> 25:00.000
I'm tapping out of this.

25:00.000 --> 25:05.040
Hey, mbnbm, is it weird for a straight guy to paint his fingernails?

25:05.040 --> 25:10.000
I've been thinking about this for a while and I would really like to paint my fingernails

25:10.000 --> 25:13.480
a color like blue, but I'm not sure how socially acceptable this would be.

25:13.480 --> 25:16.960
I also wonder what girls think if they saw this and they don't already know me.

25:16.960 --> 25:19.400
What do you guys think inquisitive in Illinois?

25:19.400 --> 25:20.400
Real quick.

25:20.400 --> 25:25.400
I want to clarify something about this question that I know to be true.

25:25.400 --> 25:29.800
Whether it's weird or not has nothing to do if you are a straight guy or a gay guy.

25:29.800 --> 25:30.800
Yeah.

25:30.800 --> 25:32.420
That's a, yeah.

25:32.420 --> 25:34.340
That's a misconception that I find very funny.

25:34.340 --> 25:36.880
Like if this was a gay guy doing it, it would be totally cool.

25:36.880 --> 25:37.880
Yeah.

25:37.880 --> 25:39.640
I don't think the gay thing enters into it.

25:39.640 --> 25:45.240
Like I don't think, I mean, obviously there's a, it's a gender identity issue, but I wouldn't

25:45.240 --> 25:50.280
think it would be any more or less socially acceptable for a straight or a gay guy.

25:50.280 --> 25:54.740
I don't think it would matter really.

25:54.740 --> 25:57.840
Did we get this because we talked about nail care last week?

25:57.840 --> 26:02.320
God, I never thought when we started this show that this would be, this would be one

26:02.320 --> 26:05.040
of our frequent subjects.

26:05.040 --> 26:09.840
I think, I mean, if you're asking the question, I typically think that if you have to ask

26:09.840 --> 26:12.320
if something's socially unacceptable, it probably is.

26:12.320 --> 26:13.320
Yeah.

26:13.320 --> 26:16.160
Like yes, obviously it's socially unacceptable.

26:16.160 --> 26:20.000
It's not a thing that people do, but that shouldn't stop you from doing it, you know?

26:20.000 --> 26:22.180
Listen, you doing it isn't going to kill somebody.

26:22.180 --> 26:23.440
It's not like the end of the world.

26:23.440 --> 26:25.360
You do it and you want to do it, then do it.

26:25.360 --> 26:28.840
But yeah, you're going to get some weird looks and people are going to give you shit about

26:28.840 --> 26:29.840
it.

26:29.840 --> 26:30.840
Like, because it is weird.

26:30.840 --> 26:35.800
But if you want to, it's, isn't that sort of like, isn't it sort of like the, what was

26:35.800 --> 26:40.000
it we were talking about where if, if you are the sort of person that-

26:40.000 --> 26:42.520
Yeah, we were talking about manicures and hats.

26:42.520 --> 26:43.520
Yeah.

26:43.520 --> 26:47.060
Like if you're the sort of person that can pull that off, that's your style, don't let

26:47.060 --> 26:52.880
it keep you from it, but you know, things like, oh, like take Penn Jillette, for example.

26:52.880 --> 26:54.440
Yeah, that's exactly what I was going to say.

26:54.440 --> 27:00.840
Penn Jillette is a cool guy and he's, you know, he's rock and roll, manly.

27:00.840 --> 27:07.720
You know, I don't think he's, he is somebody you could accuse of being unhip and he rocks

27:07.720 --> 27:09.360
some nail polish on there.

27:09.360 --> 27:13.980
Now, I don't know who that is, but I just assume that it's somebody who's, is it somebody

27:13.980 --> 27:15.720
who's like Trace Angel?

27:15.720 --> 27:18.200
You know, you know Penn Jillette is.

27:18.200 --> 27:19.200
Is that like Criss Angel?

27:19.200 --> 27:23.200
No, it's like, like Penn of Penn and Teller?

27:23.200 --> 27:24.200
Not.

27:24.200 --> 27:27.120
Are you serious?

27:27.120 --> 27:28.520
I'm not familiar.

27:28.520 --> 27:32.080
I know who Criss Angel is, is it somebody like, cause he also paints his nails.

27:32.080 --> 27:34.760
They, no, they, they do the magic goofs.

27:34.760 --> 27:37.760
Like, oh, kind of like Criss Angel, you mean?

27:37.760 --> 27:39.320
They're basically like Criss Angel, okay?

27:39.320 --> 27:40.320
Yes.

27:40.320 --> 27:41.320
Yes, perfect.

27:41.320 --> 27:42.320
Criss Angel.

27:42.320 --> 27:44.200
They're like a fat and silent Criss Angel.

27:44.200 --> 27:50.120
You're telling me that it's like people who do magic tricks and illusions and acts of

27:50.120 --> 27:51.120
misdirection.

27:51.120 --> 27:52.120
Mm-hmm.

27:52.120 --> 27:53.120
Prestidigitation.

27:53.120 --> 27:54.120
Prestidigitation.

27:54.120 --> 27:59.040
Ledger mane and their nails are painted.

27:59.040 --> 28:05.200
So I mean, if it walks like a Criss Angel and wears, wears big black pants like a Criss

28:05.200 --> 28:08.600
Angel, then it's probably a Criss Angel.

28:08.600 --> 28:13.280
If I see somebody floating above the Luxor, I've got to assume that's Criss Angel.

28:13.280 --> 28:14.280
Yeah.

28:14.280 --> 28:19.240
So what you're saying is, yes, he can paint his fingernails as long as he engages in prestidigitation.

28:19.240 --> 28:20.240
Mm-hmm.

28:20.240 --> 28:21.240
Okay.

28:21.240 --> 28:24.920
I think, no, I think what he's saying is if he paints his nails and engages in prestidigitation,

28:24.920 --> 28:29.560
he is, by all rights and purposes, he should be able to walk into any bank.

28:29.560 --> 28:32.360
And so I would like to withdraw the $37.

28:32.360 --> 28:34.240
Can I see two forms of identification?

28:34.240 --> 28:35.240
Sure.

28:35.240 --> 28:36.800
Check out these nails and this awesome card trick.

28:36.800 --> 28:40.160
Check out these, check out these nails and I'm wearing your watch.

28:40.160 --> 28:43.360
Let me get a couple hundo.

28:43.360 --> 28:46.280
Just take it out of the Criss Angel account.

28:46.280 --> 28:50.000
Check out the one labeled fun money.

28:50.000 --> 28:54.520
Sir, this is a Bank of America in Des Moines.

28:54.520 --> 28:56.680
You do not have fungible assets here.

28:56.680 --> 28:58.120
Oh, don't I?

28:58.120 --> 28:59.120
Check it.

28:59.120 --> 29:00.120
Holy shit, where'd all this money come from?

29:00.120 --> 29:01.120
Criss Angel.

29:01.120 --> 29:03.720
It's in my hands and it has your face on it.

29:03.720 --> 29:04.720
Mind freak.

29:04.720 --> 29:05.720
I've ruined $100.

29:05.720 --> 29:06.720
Holy shit.

29:06.720 --> 29:13.560
I think maybe Criss Angel just robbed this bank.

29:13.560 --> 29:17.000
Either Criss Angel robbed the bank or he just ruined a hundred dollar bill of his.

29:17.000 --> 29:18.840
I don't think he has those to lose.

29:18.840 --> 29:19.840
Should we call the cops?

29:19.840 --> 29:21.960
I, let me, just let me think for a second.

29:21.960 --> 29:23.200
My mind is still freaked right now.

29:23.200 --> 29:24.200
Just give me a second.

29:24.200 --> 29:25.200
I'm reeling.

29:25.200 --> 29:26.800
I gotta unfreak it up here.

29:26.800 --> 29:29.240
Is anybody enough mind freaks still in the air?

29:29.240 --> 29:31.160
It's gotta be.

29:31.160 --> 29:36.160
We all think about Criss Angel in the context of mind freak, but what we rarely think about

29:36.160 --> 29:44.720
is that Criss Angel is a real person who has to go to Whole Foods and he buys kale.

29:44.720 --> 29:49.700
Like this is something, this is a real person that does these things, right?

29:49.700 --> 29:53.240
He's not just magicking all the time or maybe he is.

29:53.240 --> 29:57.040
Wouldn't you like to think that he is like even at home and no one's around, like all

29:57.040 --> 30:01.200
of a sudden the coffee's in the glass and he's like, sigh, mind freaked.

30:01.200 --> 30:09.120
My problem with mind freak is that it, it, it's unfairly, it's unfairly watchable because

30:09.120 --> 30:13.840
it's constantly taunting you with the possibility that you'll see Criss Angel killed before

30:13.840 --> 30:14.840
your eyes.

30:14.840 --> 30:19.840
It's like an irresistible ratings bait, I think, and it's not fair and I think they

30:19.840 --> 30:23.560
do have to deliver on it eventually, at least an amputation.

30:23.560 --> 30:28.760
Like today I'm going to set myself ablaze while a man shoots a revolver at me.

30:28.760 --> 30:31.560
Like oh man, clear the Tivo, here we go.

30:31.560 --> 30:35.800
What if Criss, Criss Angel really just one day like wanted to cash it all in, like he

30:35.800 --> 30:41.080
just gave up and so he filmed it and it was like, oh what an awesome trick, oh he's not

30:41.080 --> 30:42.080
moving.

30:42.080 --> 30:43.080
Yeah.

30:43.080 --> 30:44.080
Today I'm going to drink lava.

30:44.080 --> 30:45.080
Hey Criss?

30:45.080 --> 30:46.080
Criss?

30:46.080 --> 30:47.080
Criss, I wouldn't advise that.

30:47.080 --> 30:48.080
Criss, I wouldn't advise that.

30:48.080 --> 30:51.760
Um, maybe you should cancel this one.

30:51.760 --> 30:59.040
He, I'm looking at pictures of him right now and I cannot fucking handle his whole style.

30:59.040 --> 31:00.040
His whole, yeah.

31:00.040 --> 31:04.640
There's a thing on, there's a thing on, okay if you go to A&E TV right now, there is an

31:04.640 --> 31:09.020
ad for the show and the tagline of this like I think it's a maybe a trivia question or

31:09.020 --> 31:14.280
an interactive game and it, the question is will you save or kill Criss Angel?

31:14.280 --> 31:16.320
The game is called Kill Criss Angel.

31:16.320 --> 31:17.320
Okay.

31:17.320 --> 31:21.160
Like they know what they're doing with this and they, they're playing off our desire to

31:21.160 --> 31:22.160
see him die.

31:22.160 --> 31:25.840
Hey world, if you see Criss Angel, give him a hug.

31:25.840 --> 31:30.880
Just tell him like it's okay and that it's going to be alright and maybe you know he

31:30.880 --> 31:31.880
just wants to hang out.

31:31.880 --> 31:33.480
Maybe just buy Criss Angel a beer.

31:33.480 --> 31:36.120
We could save Criss Angel's life today.

31:36.120 --> 31:40.880
I would, I would like to try to reach out to Criss Angel and say it's not that there

31:40.880 --> 31:47.640
are many people I'd like to watch die on TV but you, you are the only one that keeps taunting

31:47.640 --> 31:51.040
me with the possibility and that's the only reason I'm so hungry for your death.

31:51.040 --> 31:54.040
Like the first season on that show started out as real magic, right?

31:54.040 --> 31:56.200
And now it's just like fucking bear baiting.

31:56.200 --> 31:59.120
Like it's, it's waiting to watch Criss Angel die.

31:59.120 --> 32:01.320
Did you see the bear baiting episode?

32:01.320 --> 32:04.920
I thought that it was going to gobble him up for sure.

32:04.920 --> 32:11.320
All I hope is that Criss Angel when he like does do something like drink lava, I just

32:11.320 --> 32:17.960
hope that his last words are like mind free.

32:17.960 --> 32:22.920
And now the mind that is freaked is my own.

32:22.920 --> 32:26.560
I have freaked my own mind.

32:26.560 --> 32:29.680
And now it's time to mind freak Jesus.

32:29.680 --> 32:33.720
May flights of angels freak thee mind to thine rest.

32:33.720 --> 32:39.540
Alright Criss, I gotta go through the book here and look at all of your life's sins and

32:39.540 --> 32:41.040
accomplishments and what?

32:41.040 --> 32:43.320
You're already inside the game!

32:43.320 --> 32:46.720
Hey St. Peter, I'm wearing your watch.

32:46.720 --> 32:49.080
Oh, mind freak.

32:49.080 --> 32:54.320
You know, this is a, when I worked at Best Buy, um, there was a day when I swore Criss

32:54.320 --> 32:58.960
Angel came into our store and like walked around and bought some CDs and I'm like on

32:58.960 --> 33:01.320
the radio going, I swear to God Criss Angel is here.

33:01.320 --> 33:02.420
It's Criss Angel.

33:02.420 --> 33:03.760
But it wasn't Criss Angel.

33:03.760 --> 33:07.360
It turned out to be the lead singer of Hinder.

33:07.360 --> 33:10.280
He just had that look like I'm somebody terrible.

33:10.280 --> 33:14.640
That's why lead singer of Hinder bought his own CD.

33:14.640 --> 33:17.720
You don't know me, but I'm the worst.

33:17.720 --> 33:21.720
I got a vibe from that guy like I wanted to see him die on TV.

33:21.720 --> 33:22.720
Was that Criss Angel?

33:22.720 --> 33:25.880
Nah, that was Hinder.

33:25.880 --> 33:26.880
Mr. Hinder.

33:26.880 --> 33:31.480
Griffin, if I'm ever going to buy CDs at Travis' Best Buy, then I'm going to need a trip to

33:31.480 --> 33:44.480
the Money Zone.

33:44.480 --> 33:48.760
I don't own that Best Buy, just to clarify, it's not my Best Buy.

33:48.760 --> 33:54.640
First up to Glenna from Patrick, Griffin, what's the message?

33:54.640 --> 33:58.640
Patrick would like to wish Glenna a very happy anniversary.

33:58.640 --> 34:02.600
She is his best friend and you know what, his beautiful wife.

34:02.600 --> 34:05.240
Congratulations Glenna on both of those achievements.

34:05.240 --> 34:08.880
It's their 10th anniversary on October 27th.

34:08.880 --> 34:12.960
They've been married for 10 wonderful years and he knows that they will have many more

34:12.960 --> 34:13.960
to come.

34:13.960 --> 34:18.480
A song from Griffin would be awesome, but I understand if it's not possible.

34:18.480 --> 34:20.280
I mean I can try.

34:20.280 --> 34:28.960
Sugar, sugar, how you get so fly?

34:28.960 --> 34:32.640
Amber is the color of your energy.

34:32.640 --> 34:36.560
Glenna is your wife and will remain to be.

34:36.560 --> 34:46.160
Hey, Tyler, you don't get a song, but Chelsea and Trevor Woodburn want to wish you a very,

34:46.160 --> 34:48.120
very happy 31st birthday.

34:48.120 --> 34:51.560
Ooh, the big 31, Justin, you're coming up on that one, right?

34:51.560 --> 34:54.360
Yeah, yeah, it's not a very special one.

34:54.360 --> 35:01.360
Just that march, march to the old grave room, me and Tyler, arm in arm.

35:01.360 --> 35:07.120
When your burden becomes too heavy, I will help you carry it.

35:07.120 --> 35:11.920
I will carry that burden with you and I want you to know that I'm here for you.

35:11.920 --> 35:16.260
Like a bridge over old ass troubled water.

35:16.260 --> 35:21.360
What if instead of celebrating your 31st birthday, you celebrated the 10 year anniversary of

35:21.360 --> 35:22.920
your 21st birthday?

35:22.920 --> 35:24.680
Oh, that's fun.

35:24.680 --> 35:28.880
That sounds really great, Cheryl, from accounting.

35:28.880 --> 35:37.760
Hey, this next one, guys, let's take a step back because this one's all about Joseph.

35:37.760 --> 35:39.360
Travis, give me the pitch.

35:39.360 --> 35:41.360
Well, here's the deal, ladies.

35:41.360 --> 35:42.360
Hey, ladies.

35:42.360 --> 35:44.920
His name is Joseph Buchanan, or JJ.

35:44.920 --> 35:48.380
He's 20, but he's turning 21 on the 29th of October.

35:48.380 --> 35:53.560
He moved from Wichita, Kansas to Lawton, OK, to manage a subway while I go to college.

35:53.560 --> 35:54.720
While you go to college?

35:54.720 --> 35:55.720
I jump 10 sits.

35:55.720 --> 35:59.280
Hey, Joseph, would you mind just working at this?

35:59.280 --> 36:02.920
Would you be a sandwich engineer for me while I do my four year?

36:02.920 --> 36:07.200
Can you work at Subway while I go to college for us?

36:07.200 --> 36:08.200
Thanks.

36:08.200 --> 36:12.680
He enjoys reading, playing video games, and you can contact him by searching on Facebook

36:12.680 --> 36:15.040
for Joseph James Buchanan.

36:15.040 --> 36:21.500
This is a stand up young man, and I feel like he's got, I mean, he's almost 21 so he can

36:21.500 --> 36:23.760
buy you booze.

36:23.760 --> 36:29.600
And he's getting himself a college degree, ladies, and a degree in sandwich engineering.

36:29.600 --> 36:36.040
That's gonna be a cool guy.

36:36.040 --> 36:37.680
I'm looking at this profile right now.

36:37.680 --> 36:43.480
He's got some great interests, like some great films, 300, Anchorman, Dune, he's there for

36:43.480 --> 36:44.480
you.

36:44.480 --> 36:46.380
Mythbusters, Scrubs, he's into it.

36:46.380 --> 36:53.800
I'm looking at a picture of him doing, he's benching like 400, and then here's a picture

36:53.800 --> 36:58.800
of him, and it looks like he's been making love for like a really long time, so he looks

36:58.800 --> 37:00.840
really competent in that department.

37:00.840 --> 37:02.960
It looks like he's been doing it like really good, too.

37:02.960 --> 37:08.120
He's been doing it like super good, because like she is high-fiving him, and there's a

37:08.120 --> 37:14.640
clock on the wall that's like a timer, like a stopwatch, and it says 35.

37:14.640 --> 37:17.960
So they've been at least doing it for 35 minutes in this good manner.

37:17.960 --> 37:24.680
Now, Griffin, you're going into the realm of fantasy, like impossibility.

37:24.680 --> 37:28.300
So ladies, get at him, Joseph James Buchanan.

37:28.300 --> 37:35.320
If you want to get onto the money zone, our Jumbotron where we focus in on one of our

37:35.320 --> 37:39.080
very special listeners, go to MaximumFun.org.org.

37:39.080 --> 37:45.480
And you can do that, and if you're a business that you want us to highlight, Griffin will

37:45.480 --> 37:50.640
write a professional-style jingle for you and sing it.

37:50.640 --> 37:54.520
I want to thank Joseph for being so brave as to be our first personal ad.

37:54.520 --> 37:55.520
I know.

37:55.520 --> 37:56.840
Ladies, please don't let us down.

37:56.840 --> 37:57.840
Get at him.

37:57.840 --> 37:59.280
Please get him some.

37:59.280 --> 38:00.520
Please get at him.

38:00.520 --> 38:04.120
Recently, an ex-boyfriend of mine has moved back to town.

38:04.120 --> 38:05.120
We get along.

38:05.120 --> 38:07.280
We don't really gel as friends.

38:07.280 --> 38:13.300
The problem is, he gets along really well with my older sister of one year.

38:13.300 --> 38:17.360
They hang out together often, which makes me jealous in a he-was-mine-first kind of

38:17.360 --> 38:19.720
way, which was somewhat juvenile.

38:19.720 --> 38:25.040
It makes me feel silly, as without her influence, I feel no need to pursue him.

38:25.040 --> 38:27.480
Do you know if it's possible to overcome this jealousy?

38:27.480 --> 38:32.320
And if so, please share this wisdom childishly covetous."

38:32.320 --> 38:35.320
Oh, the heart, right?

38:35.320 --> 38:37.120
The heart.

38:37.120 --> 38:39.400
That's the trickiest muscle.

38:39.400 --> 38:44.800
Tangled web of tissue and blood and bones.

38:44.800 --> 38:45.800
That's the heart.

38:45.800 --> 38:48.400
Well, it sounds like it's a heart freak.

38:48.400 --> 38:52.080
Sounds like somebody's trying to heart-freak you.

38:52.080 --> 38:54.120
I mean, this dude knows what he's doing.

38:54.120 --> 38:55.120
Oh, yeah.

38:55.120 --> 38:56.120
Yeah, he does.

38:56.120 --> 38:58.560
Yeah, he's like the Criss Angel of hearts.

38:58.560 --> 39:02.720
Nice to meet you, my name's Tom Jones.

39:02.720 --> 39:03.720
Criss Angel of hearts.

39:03.720 --> 39:07.240
That's my name tag.

39:07.240 --> 39:15.280
He knows that he's doing it, and I think, I don't know, your sister might not have intentions

39:15.280 --> 39:21.400
like that, but you gotta talk to your sister, I think.

39:21.400 --> 39:24.080
I don't think this is such a ridiculous thing.

39:24.080 --> 39:29.120
If one of you two is hanging out with an ex-girlfriend of mine, just like bro-ing out, I would say

39:29.120 --> 39:30.120
something to you.

39:30.120 --> 39:31.120
It would be weird, yeah.

39:31.120 --> 39:32.120
It would be weird.

39:32.120 --> 39:37.360
It wouldn't necessarily, I don't think it would upset me in a way where I'd be jealous

39:37.360 --> 39:41.920
in any way, but it would be so weird that it would be off-putting for me.

39:41.920 --> 39:47.200
Yeah, and I think that that's, sometimes the heart's stupid, and I think your heart may

39:47.200 --> 39:55.400
be mixing up the fact that it's weird with making you feel like you want him.

39:55.400 --> 39:59.920
Your heart doesn't want him and doesn't want to be back with him, and in your head I can

39:59.920 --> 40:02.800
hear you saying that, like you recognize that.

40:02.800 --> 40:08.800
What's happening is the weirdness and the hurt of your sister doing that is making you

40:08.800 --> 40:10.160
jealous.

40:10.160 --> 40:16.080
I think more specifically, you're a little hurt that your sister is doing this more than

40:16.080 --> 40:18.320
you are jealous of their relationship.

40:18.320 --> 40:22.080
And I think if nothing else, just talking to your sister about it just to clarify the

40:22.080 --> 40:28.080
situation because your sister might say like, oh, it's being nice because it's your ex-boyfriend,

40:28.080 --> 40:34.440
but finding out what's going on will at least help you clarify how you're feeling about

40:34.440 --> 40:37.560
the situation.

40:37.560 --> 40:43.240
You're on some tricky territory here because I think your focus is off a little bit, and

40:43.240 --> 40:48.320
your focus needs to be, this is a thing that's happening that could upset your relationship

40:48.320 --> 40:55.040
with your sister, which is so, so, so much more important than you being uncomfortable

40:55.040 --> 40:57.480
with your ex-boyfriend being back in town.

40:57.480 --> 41:01.160
I'm willing to bet that if he told your sister, she would say, oh, I didn't realize it was

41:01.160 --> 41:02.160
bothering you.

41:02.160 --> 41:03.160
Cool.

41:03.160 --> 41:04.160
Yeah.

41:04.160 --> 41:05.160
Like, I won't hang out with him anymore.

41:05.160 --> 41:06.160
Yeah.

41:06.160 --> 41:07.160
It won't be that important to her.

41:07.160 --> 41:08.160
Yeah.

41:08.160 --> 41:10.240
Family first, you know?

41:10.240 --> 41:11.240
Family first.

41:11.240 --> 41:12.240
Blood before wine.

41:12.240 --> 41:13.240
Sure.

41:13.240 --> 41:14.240
What?

41:14.240 --> 41:15.240
What?

41:15.240 --> 41:16.500
That's what Dracula says.

41:16.500 --> 41:20.880
This Yahoo is sent in by Dracula, who is also known as Matt Labelle.

41:20.880 --> 41:21.880
Thank you, Matt.

41:21.880 --> 41:22.880
Matt Labelle is Dracula?

41:22.880 --> 41:23.880
Yeah, I know.

41:23.880 --> 41:24.880
I knew it.

41:24.880 --> 41:27.180
Son of a plastic Matt.

41:27.180 --> 41:32.680
Next by Yahoo answers user Bobby, who asks, Mac freak.

41:32.680 --> 41:38.400
Who asks, is it offensive to dress up as a giant penis with a pair of boobs to answer

41:38.400 --> 41:43.280
the door for trick-or-treaters?

41:43.280 --> 41:48.360
I am planning on donning a giant penis costume complete with plastic boobs and a plastic

41:48.360 --> 41:49.880
butt piece.

41:49.880 --> 41:52.920
If I answer the door for trick-or-treaters, would parents be offended?

41:52.920 --> 41:56.360
I mean, it's not like people have to ring my doorbell, and it is my house.

41:56.360 --> 41:57.880
Is it violating anyone's rights?

41:57.880 --> 42:00.160
I mean, maybe it would be better if I didn't answer the door.

42:00.160 --> 42:01.160
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

42:01.160 --> 42:05.040
So you just sit in your apartment alone dressed up like a boob dick?

42:05.040 --> 42:06.040
Drinking.

42:06.040 --> 42:07.480
Boob dick with butt piece.

42:07.480 --> 42:08.480
Why does it...

42:08.480 --> 42:09.480
What?

42:09.480 --> 42:10.480
What's your theme?

42:10.480 --> 42:12.480
What's the overall palette of this costume?

42:12.480 --> 42:14.120
Why does the dick have boobs?

42:14.120 --> 42:15.120
I don't understand.

42:15.120 --> 42:17.000
I'm going to be Freezer Gaddafi.

42:17.000 --> 42:18.520
Oh, me?

42:18.520 --> 42:20.160
I'm going to be a ghost.

42:20.160 --> 42:24.860
I'm going to be a boob dick complete with plastic butt piece.

42:24.860 --> 42:26.920
You know, I'm not doing just one.

42:26.920 --> 42:30.600
I decided I would go for the full Monty, the full Nightmare Monty.

42:30.600 --> 42:31.600
Yeah.

42:31.600 --> 42:36.320
You know, if you pulled down Prince's pants, that's what you would see, right?

42:36.320 --> 42:37.320
Pardon me.

42:37.320 --> 42:41.680
The artist formerly known as Prince, you have boobs and a butt on your penis.

42:41.680 --> 42:44.420
You have an anatomically correct penis.

42:44.420 --> 42:47.120
It's like you have a sexy lady as your penis.

42:47.120 --> 42:48.400
Yeah.

42:48.400 --> 42:50.680
What's going on down there, Prince?

42:50.680 --> 42:51.680
Does that even...

42:51.680 --> 42:52.680
Does it work?

42:52.680 --> 42:53.680
It does.

42:53.680 --> 42:55.680
It does. You know the only thing that comes out of it?

42:55.680 --> 42:56.680
Purple rain.

42:56.680 --> 42:57.680
Purple rain.

42:57.680 --> 42:58.680
God damn.

42:58.680 --> 42:59.680
Oh, no.

42:59.680 --> 43:03.720
That's the end of the show, folks.

43:03.720 --> 43:04.720
How...

43:04.720 --> 43:05.720
77 good episodes.

43:05.720 --> 43:06.720
This...

43:06.720 --> 43:07.960
How...

43:07.960 --> 43:15.200
I think that the kids, even the six-year-old that comes to your door and opens it is going

43:15.200 --> 43:17.560
to be more confused than upset.

43:17.560 --> 43:22.400
They may not even make the connection that you're supposed to be a penis.

43:22.400 --> 43:23.800
What do you...

43:23.800 --> 43:27.760
You're like a naked woman wearing a mushroom on your head.

43:27.760 --> 43:28.760
I don't...

43:28.760 --> 43:30.680
Are you naked Susan Powder?

43:30.680 --> 43:31.680
Like what?

43:31.680 --> 43:32.680
Here's the thing.

43:32.680 --> 43:36.080
I'm willing to bet that if you're the type of guy that sits around and thinks about this

43:36.080 --> 43:38.640
question, people aren't going to be ringing your doorbell.

43:38.640 --> 43:40.240
They know that guy's house.

43:40.240 --> 43:41.240
Yeah.

43:41.240 --> 43:42.240
I'm trying...

43:42.240 --> 43:43.240
Can we...

43:43.240 --> 43:47.040
But he does give away full-size candy bars and that's the trade-off.

43:47.040 --> 43:56.920
Can we get a vagina on this costume and you can be like Bacchus, God of Sex.

43:56.920 --> 43:57.920
I am everything.

43:57.920 --> 43:58.920
It's easy.

43:58.920 --> 43:59.920
You just put it over the mouth hole.

43:59.920 --> 44:00.920
No.

44:00.920 --> 44:01.920
What do you want?

44:01.920 --> 44:02.920
No.

44:02.920 --> 44:03.920
What are you in the mood for?

44:03.920 --> 44:04.920
Is that a...

44:04.920 --> 44:08.600
Because I got it all.

44:08.600 --> 44:11.520
Does that boob butt penis have a Van Dyke?

44:11.520 --> 44:12.520
No.

44:12.520 --> 44:15.560
I can understand your confusion.

44:15.560 --> 44:16.560
Is that a Hitler mustache?

44:16.560 --> 44:17.560
It is not.

44:17.560 --> 44:18.560
It is not.

44:18.560 --> 44:19.560
It is a...

44:19.560 --> 44:21.600
What if you just did the vagina as a hand puppet?

44:21.600 --> 44:22.600
Christ.

44:22.600 --> 44:28.320
How good would the candy bar have to be before you...

44:28.320 --> 44:29.320
If some dad...

44:29.320 --> 44:33.680
It's a king-size payday, so I'm not certain because it's king-size, but it's payday.

44:33.680 --> 44:36.400
Did you go to that house?

44:36.400 --> 44:41.760
There's a guy dressed up in there like Princess Genitalia, but here's the thing.

44:41.760 --> 44:46.680
Whatchamacallit, he is giving away rolls of quarters.

44:46.680 --> 44:48.640
It's like 10 bucks a quarters.

44:48.640 --> 44:54.120
Listen, that house, there is a man dressed up like all the genitalia, and he's only

44:54.120 --> 44:58.000
giving out bit of honeys, so let's just make it clear.

44:58.000 --> 44:59.000
That might be a crime, actually.

44:59.000 --> 45:00.760
That may be against the law.

45:00.760 --> 45:05.800
I saw his dick, boobs, butt, and vagina, and I got some Necco wafers, so the crime did

45:05.800 --> 45:07.160
not fit the punchline.

45:07.160 --> 45:08.160
You know what?

45:08.160 --> 45:12.160
I always say that if he's gonna do it, he embraces it, and he sits on a lawn chair on

45:12.160 --> 45:13.160
the porch.

45:13.160 --> 45:14.160
Yeah.

45:14.160 --> 45:15.160
Let him know what they're...

45:15.160 --> 45:16.160
Yeah.

45:16.160 --> 45:17.160
Getting into.

45:17.160 --> 45:18.160
And wave.

45:18.160 --> 45:21.200
This man talks a big game, but I have to believe that if a child came to his house and opened

45:21.200 --> 45:26.440
the door, he wouldn't just open it dressed up as all the genitalia and then be like,

45:26.440 --> 45:27.440
sup!

45:27.440 --> 45:28.440
Hey!

45:28.440 --> 45:29.440
I'm embarrassed.

45:29.440 --> 45:30.440
What are you?

45:30.440 --> 45:32.080
Oh, you're a Ninja Turtle.

45:32.080 --> 45:34.680
You'll know what I am later.

45:34.680 --> 45:40.120
Daddy's gonna take you home and give you the worst talk of your entire life that anyone's

45:40.120 --> 45:41.120
ever received.

45:41.120 --> 45:42.120
That may be...

45:42.120 --> 45:45.440
To explain that constitute a child, it may constitute child abuse.

45:45.440 --> 45:46.440
I'm not...

45:46.440 --> 45:47.440
I can't say for sure.

45:47.440 --> 45:51.640
Well, honey, this was a great Halloween, but now for your own good, I have to murder you.

45:51.640 --> 45:52.640
Yeah.

45:52.640 --> 45:55.720
Eight years later, that child is gonna be a senior in high school, it's gonna be the

45:55.720 --> 46:00.280
night of his senior prom, he's gonna pull down his girlfriend's thing, and then be like,

46:00.280 --> 46:02.840
hmm, this isn't how I know it to be.

46:02.840 --> 46:06.320
This isn't how I learned it.

46:06.320 --> 46:07.960
Maybe it's a diagram costume.

46:07.960 --> 46:13.280
It's like slim good body, you know, it's slim bad body.

46:13.280 --> 46:14.600
Just shows you all the bad things.

46:14.600 --> 46:16.600
Hey, where's your boob dick?

46:16.600 --> 46:17.600
This isn't...

46:17.600 --> 46:18.600
This is...

46:18.600 --> 46:19.600
I don't even know what to...

46:19.600 --> 46:20.600
What the hell?

46:20.600 --> 46:21.600
What's this bait and switch?

46:21.600 --> 46:22.600
This is just like a normal vagina.

46:22.600 --> 46:23.600
You only got the one.

46:23.600 --> 46:25.280
I need all four.

46:25.280 --> 46:26.280
I can't finish.

46:26.280 --> 46:28.320
I can't...

46:28.320 --> 46:29.320
Save me, Prince.

46:29.320 --> 46:30.320
Save me, Prince.

46:30.320 --> 46:35.040
The only girl for me is Prince.

46:35.040 --> 46:37.160
I recently met a girl in a bookstore.

46:37.160 --> 46:41.900
She works there, and I really liked her, so next time I went there, I asked her out.

46:41.900 --> 46:45.420
She said she can't, but I can always come by for tea at the bookstore, which is also

46:45.420 --> 46:46.800
a tea shop.

46:46.800 --> 46:49.200
I'm pretty sure that means she has a boyfriend.

46:49.200 --> 46:52.900
She was very nice, and then every time I go there, we end up talking for a few minutes.

46:52.900 --> 46:59.540
Should I go and ask her for that tea, or just move away from this city, Mitch in Romania?

46:59.540 --> 47:02.120
Did you say Mitch or Dracul?

47:02.120 --> 47:06.560
Well, Dracul, here's the deal.

47:06.560 --> 47:10.720
I don't know if she has a boyfriend or not, but she doesn't want to have that tea with

47:10.720 --> 47:12.120
you.

47:12.120 --> 47:21.000
I was reading in a book, and I forget the name of the book, the title escapes me, but

47:21.000 --> 47:27.640
it's a book about etiquette, and in that book, they introduce the idea of the Brad Pitt test,

47:27.640 --> 47:32.360
which I think is a wonderful, wonderful tool that everyone can implement in their day-to-day

47:32.360 --> 47:34.460
lives.

47:34.460 --> 47:43.200
If Brad Pitt asked a girl out at a tea shop, it wouldn't even be an issue.

47:43.200 --> 47:44.560
She would have that tea.

47:44.560 --> 47:46.800
She would go wherever.

47:46.800 --> 47:53.480
If she wanted to have this date with you, it would have gone down.

47:53.480 --> 47:54.480
That's what I'm saying.

47:54.480 --> 48:00.040
I'm not comfortable with the idea of every man on earth evaluating himself compared to

48:00.040 --> 48:01.040
Brad Pitt.

48:01.040 --> 48:02.040
How many steps down?

48:02.040 --> 48:03.040
No, no, no.

48:03.040 --> 48:04.040
I don't think that's it.

48:04.040 --> 48:08.240
What it sounds like to me is it's a criteria of people will often say, well, she couldn't

48:08.240 --> 48:12.960
do it because she was at work, or she couldn't do it because she has a boyfriend, but the

48:12.960 --> 48:15.760
deal is she said no without saying no.

48:15.760 --> 48:16.760
She was being nice.

48:16.760 --> 48:17.760
Right.

48:17.760 --> 48:19.920
You got politely turned down for whatever reason.

48:19.920 --> 48:21.640
Maybe she has a boyfriend, maybe she doesn't.

48:21.640 --> 48:28.960
Yeah, I mean, you got turned down, you have a great way of saving face because you already

48:28.960 --> 48:29.960
go there.

48:29.960 --> 48:35.160
Just go and enjoy her in the ladies' zoo that is her job and appreciate her there.

48:35.160 --> 48:44.060
I have another idea, and that is that you need to give her the Paul Giamatti test.

48:44.060 --> 48:50.840
That is, if she would go out with Paul Giamatti, she would probably go out with you.

48:50.840 --> 48:52.200
What are her standards like?

48:52.200 --> 48:53.200
Yeah.

48:53.200 --> 48:56.120
Maybe you need to meet this boyfriend, and maybe he's just a real ugly pile of crap.

48:56.120 --> 48:59.400
I feel like if you compare yourself to Brad Pitt on a day-to-day, you're going to lose

48:59.400 --> 49:00.400
your mind.

49:00.400 --> 49:04.280
If you compare yourself to Paul Giamatti in any field other than acting, of which he is

49:04.280 --> 49:10.560
superb and sublime, then it's going to go much, much better for your self-esteem.

49:10.560 --> 49:14.520
Can we for once just take it easy on Paul Giamatti on one of these shows?

49:14.520 --> 49:15.520
No, you know why?

49:15.520 --> 49:17.920
He's out there doing it every day, Griffin.

49:17.920 --> 49:19.200
But he's so good.

49:19.200 --> 49:23.320
I saw him on Ides of March, I wept, and his part wasn't even particularly sad.

49:23.320 --> 49:26.880
It was actually rather a happy part.

49:26.880 --> 49:27.880
It was.

49:27.880 --> 49:28.880
But he's...

49:28.880 --> 49:33.600
Ides of March, filmed in Cincinnati, starring Billy Jays.

49:33.600 --> 49:36.440
Yeah, that's true.

49:36.440 --> 49:40.200
He looks like a... what are those creatures?

49:40.200 --> 49:41.200
A big toe?

49:41.200 --> 49:46.120
No, like a sleaze stack.

49:46.120 --> 49:49.800
I've recently been entered into your relationship.

49:49.800 --> 49:54.160
We can't just bounce off that subject by me saying that Paul Giamatti looks like a sleaze

49:54.160 --> 49:55.160
stack.

49:55.160 --> 49:58.560
That's usually when one of the two of you chides me, and I say, I'm sorry, Paul Giamatti.

49:58.560 --> 49:59.560
We gotta come to a...

49:59.560 --> 50:00.560
You know what?

50:00.560 --> 50:01.560
Sometimes, Griffin, you just nail it.

50:01.560 --> 50:06.280
Yeah, sometimes you just lead... you and Paul Giamatti live in your own, like, parallel

50:06.280 --> 50:10.200
universe together, and if you want to make amends with him, you go to his house.

50:10.200 --> 50:15.960
I'm tired of you using our show as a platform to apologize to Paul Giamatti.

50:15.960 --> 50:16.960
You know what, Griffin?

50:16.960 --> 50:17.960
Buy a fucking person, Aladdin.

50:17.960 --> 50:23.240
Say you're sorry to Paul from now on, because I'm tired of you using NBNB AM as a bully

50:23.240 --> 50:27.040
pulpit to apologize for bullying Paul Giamatti.

50:27.040 --> 50:28.040
It's done.

50:28.040 --> 50:29.040
It's over.

50:29.040 --> 50:31.040
Hey, guys, can we cut out cyberbullying of Paul Giamatti, please?

50:31.040 --> 50:32.680
Can I just say one thing, though?

50:32.680 --> 50:36.360
Yeah, as long as it's not directly addressed to Paul Giamatti.

50:36.360 --> 50:37.360
Paul, if you're...

50:37.360 --> 50:38.360
Not as much.

50:38.360 --> 50:39.360
Paul, if you're...

50:39.360 --> 50:43.400
I've recently entered into your relationship with this girl.

50:43.400 --> 50:50.040
I would like to issue a statement to all Paul Giamattis, and that is that I'm so sorry.

50:50.040 --> 50:52.040
I'm so sorry.

50:52.040 --> 50:53.040
Paul's...

50:53.040 --> 50:56.120
There's a Paul Giamatti in Idaho right now that's, like, crying.

50:56.120 --> 50:57.120
Messrs.

50:57.120 --> 51:02.080
Giamatti, I apologize for my actions in working with you.

51:02.080 --> 51:03.360
I want to get through this question.

51:03.360 --> 51:07.920
I have recently entered into a relationship with this girl who has been out of a long-term

51:07.920 --> 51:11.320
relationship for a short time, as have I.

51:11.320 --> 51:16.040
One thing that kind of bothers me, and I'm not sure if I'm in the wrong here, but about

51:16.040 --> 51:20.820
99% of her Facebook profile pictures are her kissing her ex-boyfriend.

51:20.820 --> 51:23.280
Am I in the wrong for being concerned with this?

51:23.280 --> 51:25.520
Is it okay to request these be removed?

51:25.520 --> 51:27.000
Ocarina in Ohio.

51:27.000 --> 51:29.760
I don't believe that this young man is an ocarina, but go on.

51:29.760 --> 51:33.520
No, he is not a sweet potato-shaped flute.

51:33.520 --> 51:37.280
I think what needs to be removed is you.

51:37.280 --> 51:39.880
You got to go, and I'll tell you why.

51:39.880 --> 51:44.720
Because anybody who 99% of their Facebook profile pictures...

51:44.720 --> 51:45.720
Let me say again.

51:45.720 --> 51:52.680
If she has 100 Facebook profile pictures, 99 of them are pictures of her kissing somebody.

51:52.680 --> 51:58.200
That's not okay in any language.

51:58.200 --> 52:02.020
Can we just, like, talk about this issue specifically?

52:02.020 --> 52:09.720
And this really is kind of a bugbear with me, but your profile picture on Facebook or

52:09.720 --> 52:15.800
any other social networking service should be an attractive, well-framed picture of your

52:15.800 --> 52:17.880
head and shoulders.

52:17.880 --> 52:18.880
And it should be a headshot.

52:18.880 --> 52:19.880
And that's it.

52:19.880 --> 52:20.880
It should be a headshot.

52:20.880 --> 52:23.440
It should be a professionally taken headshot.

52:23.440 --> 52:25.520
And it has to adhere to the rule of thirds.

52:25.520 --> 52:28.800
I want lighting to be appropriate.

52:28.800 --> 52:31.880
And it should be at least two years recent.

52:31.880 --> 52:33.640
Yeah, within the last two years.

52:33.640 --> 52:35.920
Because I'm tired of these motherfuckers.

52:35.920 --> 52:38.640
Your baby, stop it.

52:38.640 --> 52:39.640
Your dogs.

52:39.640 --> 52:40.640
Just a weird color design.

52:40.640 --> 52:41.880
What the fuck is that?

52:41.880 --> 52:43.160
You with other people?

52:43.160 --> 52:45.680
Hi, which one are you?

52:45.680 --> 52:49.800
Like I don't know how to address you because I don't know what you look like.

52:49.800 --> 52:52.960
I don't know if I need to talk to you like you're a fat person or not.

52:52.960 --> 52:56.840
Like I don't know if you're living your life that way.

52:56.840 --> 52:58.720
The kids drive me crazy.

52:58.720 --> 53:00.400
Why are you letting your baby have a Facebook?

53:00.400 --> 53:01.760
Why does this baby have a Facebook?

53:01.760 --> 53:04.720
And why does Breakfast of Champions is his favorite book?

53:04.720 --> 53:06.200
Like stop it, baby.

53:06.200 --> 53:07.200
I agree.

53:07.200 --> 53:11.080
Also, don't put, I don't want to see you as a cartoon.

53:11.080 --> 53:14.480
I don't want to see you as a Mad Men cartoon.

53:14.480 --> 53:16.160
Is that still a thing?

53:16.160 --> 53:18.080
I want to just see you.

53:18.080 --> 53:19.080
Just be yourself.

53:19.080 --> 53:20.120
Let me see your face.

53:20.120 --> 53:21.400
I need it.

53:21.400 --> 53:23.360
Now back to this guy's problem.

53:23.360 --> 53:25.480
Are you in the wrong for being concerned about this?

53:25.480 --> 53:28.200
Is it okay to request they be removed?

53:28.200 --> 53:29.360
It's not okay is the problem.

53:29.360 --> 53:30.360
No.

53:30.360 --> 53:31.360
They shouldn't be there in the first place.

53:31.360 --> 53:38.280
Like my girlfriend, her Facebook profile is just a hundred pictures of dudes butts.

53:38.280 --> 53:40.200
Like yeah, that's not okay.

53:40.200 --> 53:41.200
Yeah.

53:41.200 --> 53:43.240
I think the whole situation is just weird.

53:43.240 --> 53:48.640
So maybe you don't say anything and see how it shakes out and you just accept that it's

53:48.640 --> 53:49.640
already weird.

53:49.640 --> 53:56.720
Or you go down the list and you like each one or you just comment nice.

53:56.720 --> 53:57.920
Oh, I like this.

53:57.920 --> 53:59.640
Like this smooch.

53:59.640 --> 54:00.740
Everything's looking good here.

54:00.740 --> 54:02.800
Let's try this one out tonight.

54:02.800 --> 54:03.800
You guys look really in love.

54:03.800 --> 54:06.680
That must have been such a pleasant time in your life.

54:06.680 --> 54:09.160
I'm sorry you had second best with me.

54:09.160 --> 54:12.020
I bet you're sad this is over.

54:12.020 --> 54:13.860
Is this the Applebee's on third?

54:13.860 --> 54:14.920
This looks so nice.

54:14.920 --> 54:15.920
Let's go there.

54:15.920 --> 54:18.560
You and me and him if you want.

54:18.560 --> 54:19.840
I have a fun idea.

54:19.840 --> 54:21.440
Let's recreate all these pictures.

54:21.440 --> 54:27.440
It'll be like the soldier kissing his lady on V-Day.

54:27.440 --> 54:31.920
These hit locations and reenact these loving moments.

54:31.920 --> 54:34.880
Don't have a picture of you kissing anybody on Facebook.

54:34.880 --> 54:35.880
And guess what?

54:35.880 --> 54:40.460
If you do have that picture and you think you're about to break up with this person,

54:40.460 --> 54:45.160
like as soon as the idea enters your mind, you delete every single one of those pics.

54:45.160 --> 54:48.400
And if they notice like, hey, what happened to all our kiss pics?

54:48.400 --> 54:49.400
It's got to go.

54:49.400 --> 54:50.400
It's got to end right then.

54:50.400 --> 54:52.880
That's your entry into the situation.

54:52.880 --> 54:57.160
I was hoping you wouldn't notice because now I do have to in fact cut this off.

54:57.160 --> 54:59.960
Please please come into my office, Bradley.

54:59.960 --> 55:03.680
Bradley, your performance lately.

55:03.680 --> 55:07.400
We really appreciate the time that you've committed to this relationship over the last

55:07.400 --> 55:08.600
couple of months.

55:08.600 --> 55:18.360
But in this economy, it just seems like the kiss pics and the cutesy poking on Facebook,

55:18.360 --> 55:21.480
it's ruined and we're going to have to let you go.

55:21.480 --> 55:25.800
Can we please start breaking up with people and blaming the economy?

55:25.800 --> 55:29.240
It's like, listen, layoffs are all over.

55:29.240 --> 55:33.200
I just I haven't recovered from 9-11 yet.

55:33.200 --> 55:37.200
I keep saying I'm going to back.

55:37.200 --> 55:40.160
Everything changed on that day, that fateful day.

55:40.160 --> 55:42.160
And that includes my love for you.

55:42.160 --> 55:43.200
So yeah.

55:43.200 --> 55:49.440
So listen, just leave your name tag with Darcy on the way out, I guess.

55:49.440 --> 55:51.400
I want to hear Griffin's last question.

55:51.400 --> 55:54.280
But first, real quick housekeeping stuff.

55:54.280 --> 55:56.000
This is my brother, my brother and me.

55:56.000 --> 55:58.120
We're at MBMBAM.com.

55:58.120 --> 56:04.120
We're on tweedo at MBMBAM is our username.

56:04.120 --> 56:10.560
We love it when people talk about our show using the MBMBAM hashtag.

56:10.560 --> 56:18.760
I know Carly Violet did Nick Claw's Guillermo, Croco Swine is still there with YHT and John

56:18.760 --> 56:27.240
Kehoe and Invader Sham, everybody, Mr. Daniel Lixon, everybody, our gentlemen, everyone

56:27.240 --> 56:33.460
has been super nice in promoting our show on that on that service.

56:33.460 --> 56:39.720
And I want to throw out Brent O'Floss and I just did a video where we talk about this

56:39.720 --> 56:43.260
podcast and talk about his web comic, talk about all that stuff.

56:43.260 --> 56:44.260
It's very funny.

56:44.260 --> 56:47.760
And more than anything, I just wanted to say it was great catching up with my dear friend

56:47.760 --> 56:48.760
Brent O'Floss.

56:48.760 --> 56:50.720
So thanks, Brent.

56:50.720 --> 56:55.140
And I also want to thank Letty Van Hemert and Nick Rose for pimping us in meat space

56:55.140 --> 56:56.240
in the real world.

56:56.240 --> 56:57.240
Thank you guys very much.

56:57.240 --> 56:58.240
That's not much.

56:58.240 --> 57:04.960
So when you make that tweet with your mouth, mouth tweets, we are going to have if we do

57:04.960 --> 57:08.600
not already, I'm not I don't think we have this right this second.

57:08.600 --> 57:14.000
But I would not be surprised if by the time you listen to this, this is is active.

57:14.000 --> 57:22.280
But we have a brand new My Brother, My Brother, Me T-shirt headed to MaxFunStore.com from

57:22.280 --> 57:24.100
our friends at Tipotico.

57:24.100 --> 57:29.160
It is a should I say what it is or should I just let people discover for themselves?

57:29.160 --> 57:35.240
It is a fully erect penis with boobs, but yeah, it's a whole shebang.

57:35.240 --> 57:37.920
It's called the whole shebang is the name of the shirt.

57:37.920 --> 57:48.360
Check out MaxFunStore and holy spelled H-O-L-E Well, there's your episode title.

57:48.360 --> 57:50.000
We'll tweet about it when it goes live.

57:50.000 --> 57:54.800
But keep an eye out for for MaxFunStore.

57:54.800 --> 58:01.680
I don't think iTunes will let us put a thing on it called the H-O-L-E There's all this

58:01.680 --> 58:02.680
look.

58:02.680 --> 58:04.140
It's an opportunity to do research.

58:04.140 --> 58:07.460
I want to thank John Roderick in the long winners for the use of our theme song.

58:07.460 --> 58:11.920
It's a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed, which a bunch of other people

58:11.920 --> 58:15.400
got on Twitter today and said they started listening to and then it's fucking dope.

58:15.400 --> 58:20.440
And yeah, if you could take a second to think, think at John Roderick, tell him you got you

58:20.440 --> 58:22.440

We're not needy.

58:28.320 --> 58:30.320
It's not a big deal.

58:30.320 --> 58:31.320
Griffin.

58:31.320 --> 58:33.500
I'm a little needy.

58:33.500 --> 58:38.200
This one was sent in by Lisa Holofield.

58:38.200 --> 58:39.200
