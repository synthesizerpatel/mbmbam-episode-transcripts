WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:50.720
Ladies and gentlemen, we are recording this on September 11, 2011, which is of course

00:51.920 --> 00:59.200
10 years after the tragic terrorist attack on the World Trade Center. In times of strife,

00:59.200 --> 01:12.160
we look to some of our generation's wisest men. You, you work all night, and when you work,

01:12.160 --> 01:21.680
you don't feel all right. And when things stop feeling all right, and everything is all right,

01:21.680 --> 01:22.480
we will never-

01:22.480 --> 01:30.880
I'm gonna stop right here. It sounds like you're suggesting that people have a 9-11 party.

01:30.880 --> 01:34.960
No, I'm not saying people need to have a 9-11 themed party. What I'm saying is,

01:34.960 --> 01:39.680
in the face of opposition, in the face of tragedy, in the face of suffering,

01:41.040 --> 01:48.080
we get a party going. Now it's time to party, and we'll party hard. Let's get a party going,

01:48.080 --> 01:51.760
let's get a party going. When it's time to party, we will always party hard, party hard.

01:51.760 --> 01:55.520
Party hard, party hard, party hard, party hard, party hard, party hard, party hard.

01:55.520 --> 01:59.760
Let's do a show. This is my brother, my brother, me, in a vice show for the modern era,

01:59.760 --> 02:04.240
undaunted by terrorism. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

02:05.120 --> 02:07.120
I'm Travis McElroy.

02:07.120 --> 02:09.920
I am Griffin McElroy. You know, it's a shame.

02:10.640 --> 02:10.960
What? Yeah.

02:10.960 --> 02:12.160
You know, it's a real shame.

02:12.160 --> 02:13.680
Yeah. We just talked about it.

02:13.680 --> 02:20.800
Yeah. But also, I'm looking at the observances, because we forgot to do them last week,

02:20.800 --> 02:25.360
and spoiler alert, we're gonna do them later this show, but I'm looking at the daily observances.

02:26.960 --> 02:33.040
And September 11th has Patriot Day and Remembrance Day, which makes sense.

02:33.040 --> 02:36.960
September 11th is how? Depending on your political affiliation, presumably.

02:38.080 --> 02:42.240
September 11th is also National Hug Your Hound Day, and I feel like people, I feel like that,

02:42.800 --> 02:46.560
I feel like there's a lot of unhugged hounds out there. I feel like they get lost in the shuffle.

02:46.560 --> 02:51.840
Mm-hmm. Yes. Is it also called 9-11 Day? Am I making that up?

02:52.960 --> 02:54.480
No, I think Patriot Day is-

02:54.480 --> 02:56.240
9-11, wait, hold on, hold on.

02:56.240 --> 02:58.560
I feel like I've heard it called 9-11 Day.

02:58.560 --> 03:01.920
Are you suggesting to me that September 11th is also

03:01.920 --> 03:06.400
colloquially or officially referred to as 9-11 Day?

03:07.040 --> 03:11.920
This might only be at my local supermarket where they're offering 50% off American flags.

03:14.480 --> 03:15.840
Still doing it, huh?

03:15.840 --> 03:18.720
Mm-hmm. Still doing that thing.

03:18.720 --> 03:22.480
And you know what? I think what I hate most about 9-11 Day is how commercial it's become.

03:24.480 --> 03:30.160
It's just run by the greeting card and tiny American flag companies.

03:30.160 --> 03:37.840
Here's a fun fact. This is one of those crazy years where September 11th is also

03:37.840 --> 03:41.920
National Grandparents Day. It's the first Sunday after Labor Day that's today. It's September 11th.

03:41.920 --> 03:50.560
And I feel like hounds and grandparents are going to be underappreciated on this most faithful day.

03:51.440 --> 03:55.840
I think that's probably- I would say, you know what? Take your time,

03:57.040 --> 04:01.760
think about the people we lost on that day, and go hug your grandpa.

04:01.760 --> 04:03.840
Or go hug your grandpa's dog.

04:04.720 --> 04:09.680
Peepums, I love you. I love you, Peepums, but my mind is in other places.

04:09.680 --> 04:10.800
It's elsewhere.

04:10.800 --> 04:16.960
Baxter, which is the name of my hound, I am also sorry to you, but I just don't have the bandwidth.

04:16.960 --> 04:20.400
People are listening to this on September 12th, and in a way I feel like it's-

04:21.600 --> 04:26.080
they try to cauterize today. Expurgation of pity and fear, just get it all out.

04:26.080 --> 04:29.440
And then today we're like reopening it, like we're digging around in there.

04:29.440 --> 04:32.080
And now they feel bad because they didn't hug a dog.

04:32.080 --> 04:36.080
Good news tomorrow, people. It's National Boss Employee Exchange Day.

04:36.640 --> 04:39.440
Can we take a moment to talk about the show Tomorrow People?

04:39.440 --> 04:39.680
Yeah.

04:39.680 --> 04:40.320
Yeah.

04:40.320 --> 04:41.360
The Tomorrow People?

04:41.360 --> 04:41.600
Yeah.

04:41.600 --> 04:43.680
Today is National Tomorrow People Remembrance Day.

04:44.320 --> 04:46.320
Remember that that was a pretty good show.

04:46.960 --> 04:47.920
God, it was a wicked show.

04:47.920 --> 04:48.560
It was a good show.

04:48.560 --> 04:53.920
This is- our show is neither a September 11th memorial,

04:53.920 --> 04:57.040
or a show about futuristic teens that can travel through time and space.

04:58.160 --> 05:00.400
It's an advice show for the modern era.

05:00.400 --> 05:02.320
And let's get into our first question.

05:03.120 --> 05:04.720
I've started seeing this guy.

05:05.840 --> 05:08.320
I like him a lot, and everything's going well.

05:08.320 --> 05:11.920
But it's only been about two weeks, so it isn't very serious yet.

05:12.480 --> 05:13.920
His birthday is in a couple weeks,

05:13.920 --> 05:17.280
and I'm not sure what the expectation of me is this early in our relationship.

05:17.280 --> 05:18.400
Do I buy him a gift?

05:19.040 --> 05:20.080
Take him out to dinner?

05:20.880 --> 05:21.920
Bake him a cake?

05:22.640 --> 05:24.960
I'm still in school, so my budget is limited,

05:24.960 --> 05:27.760
and I don't want to freak him out with something overly extravagant.

05:27.760 --> 05:31.200
What's an appropriate birthday experience for a relationship

05:31.920 --> 05:34.960
of not even a month my barely boyfriend's birthday?

05:34.960 --> 05:40.160
Um, first off, I'm going to have to put the blame on you

05:40.160 --> 05:42.480
for starting dating him at such a terrible time.

05:42.480 --> 05:45.120
Yeah, don't start dating someone two weeks before their birthday,

05:45.120 --> 05:46.560
or two weeks before Valentine's Day.

05:46.560 --> 05:48.240
Or two weeks before Patriot Day.

05:48.240 --> 05:49.200
Yep, it's a mistake.

05:50.400 --> 05:52.720
Um, Christmas is the worst.

05:52.720 --> 05:54.800
Because then there's all these expectations of like,

05:54.800 --> 05:56.320
are you going to come over and like-

05:56.320 --> 05:57.040
Oh yeah.

05:57.040 --> 05:58.960
Chill with my fam, my peeps.

05:58.960 --> 06:01.280
Then you have to worry about getting their family presents.

06:01.280 --> 06:02.720
It's a little sticky morass.

06:02.720 --> 06:03.280
This is my something.

06:03.280 --> 06:07.680
Hey, I've had exactly 14 minutes of contact with you,

06:07.680 --> 06:10.480
so I got you a walk in the clouds on DVD.

06:11.360 --> 06:14.640
I think that don't take him to dinner,

06:14.640 --> 06:16.560
because he's probably already got other plans.

06:17.520 --> 06:18.560
Get him a gift.

06:18.560 --> 06:20.240
That's cool, that's a cool bet.

06:20.880 --> 06:22.640
Well you don't think he's going to do like a party

06:22.640 --> 06:24.240
or his friends want to take him to drinks,

06:24.240 --> 06:26.560
and he blows off his friends to go out to dinner

06:26.560 --> 06:27.920
with his two-week girlfriend?

06:27.920 --> 06:28.080
Well-

06:28.080 --> 06:28.800
How was your birthday?

06:28.800 --> 06:29.920
How was your birthday, Martin?

06:29.920 --> 06:31.200
Uh, it was okay.

06:31.200 --> 06:32.720
I'm super hungry.

06:32.720 --> 06:34.080
I am just the most hungry,

06:34.080 --> 06:36.000
because all my friends thought that the other friends

06:36.000 --> 06:38.240
were going to take me to take me to Applebee's.

06:38.240 --> 06:39.280
Pretty cool birthday.

06:39.280 --> 06:43.040
I stayed in and I heated up a Marie Callender

06:44.800 --> 06:48.720
stuffing and chicken and gravy in my stove,

06:48.720 --> 06:52.400
and I ate it and I watched like half of Miss Congeniality 2.

06:52.400 --> 06:55.680
To be fair, a Marie Callender pot pie is good at any time.

06:56.640 --> 06:58.160
Except when it's your birthday and you're alone.

06:58.160 --> 06:59.120
Except when it's your birthday

06:59.120 --> 07:01.280
and you put a candle in it, unlit, and cry.

07:01.280 --> 07:02.400
Oh, man.

07:02.400 --> 07:06.720
Um, I think, okay, let's set a price point of gift.

07:06.720 --> 07:09.200
What's the most you spend on a two-week boyfriend?

07:09.200 --> 07:09.520
30.

07:11.120 --> 07:12.400
You think 30?

07:12.400 --> 07:12.640
Yeah.

07:13.360 --> 07:14.160
30's too much.

07:14.800 --> 07:15.360
20.

07:15.360 --> 07:16.720
30 is too much?

07:16.720 --> 07:20.000
Yeah, I would say a new release DVD, nothing more than that.

07:20.720 --> 07:24.000
This is awkward, Travis, because you've just outed the fact

07:24.000 --> 07:27.440
that I am rolling in so much Mad Scrilla,

07:27.440 --> 07:31.840
and you've got some, you're working with table scraps.

07:31.840 --> 07:33.840
Listen, it ain't about your budget.

07:33.840 --> 07:36.000
It's about the statement you're making with the present.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.440
It is completely and entirely about your budget.

07:38.080 --> 07:41.360
No, if you go and like buy a really nice present

07:41.360 --> 07:43.120
that they're not expecting, well, no, wait.

07:43.120 --> 07:45.200
I take that back, because it's different

07:45.200 --> 07:47.280
because you're not exchanging presents.

07:47.280 --> 07:48.800
If you are a rich dude

07:48.800 --> 07:51.520
and you spend more on your free-range toilet paper

07:52.160 --> 07:54.560
than your gift for your two-week girlfriend,

07:54.560 --> 07:55.040
you are actual.

07:55.040 --> 07:57.040
Torture-free, torture-free toilet paper.

07:57.040 --> 07:58.080
Torture-free TP.

07:58.640 --> 08:03.280
I'm gonna say spend a lot of money, set a precedent.

08:03.280 --> 08:05.120
If you set a precedent and spend a lot of money,

08:05.120 --> 08:07.280
then next time it's his turn to give you a present,

08:08.080 --> 08:10.800
you've set the precedent that you get each other awesome things.

08:10.800 --> 08:12.320
Oh, man, that would be terrible.

08:12.320 --> 08:13.280
No, wait, it wouldn't.

08:14.400 --> 08:17.280
Honey, I got you this Zune HD for Easter.

08:17.280 --> 08:19.920
Holy shit, it's Easter.

08:19.920 --> 08:21.440
I just need some Cadbury ice,

08:21.440 --> 08:23.120
and you went and you busted out a Zune HD.

08:23.840 --> 08:24.480
You're the best.

08:24.480 --> 08:25.120
That's one thing.

08:25.120 --> 08:26.480
This is an awesome idea.

08:26.480 --> 08:28.320
So go nice, do something awesome.

08:29.040 --> 08:30.320
Yeah, go like really good.

08:30.320 --> 08:32.320
I don't think anybody feels like,

08:32.320 --> 08:35.120
okay, listen, what's your worry?

08:35.120 --> 08:37.280
The worry is that if you have to split up,

08:37.280 --> 08:38.080
it'll be weird.

08:38.080 --> 08:38.800
Is that the thing?

08:39.360 --> 08:40.800
I think our worry is that

08:40.800 --> 08:42.400
she's gonna get him something too awesome

08:42.400 --> 08:44.160
and he's gonna realize she likes him a lot.

08:44.960 --> 08:46.240
Really, that's what it is.

08:46.800 --> 08:47.680
Oh, fuck it.

08:47.680 --> 08:49.040
Just throw your hat over the fence.

08:49.040 --> 08:50.560
Go buy him a Zune HD.

08:50.560 --> 08:51.360
Yeah, dude.

08:52.720 --> 08:54.320
Draw a line in the sand and say,

08:54.320 --> 08:55.840
this is for serious.

08:55.840 --> 08:58.320
Hey, I bought you this discontinued touchpad.

09:00.320 --> 09:01.200
It's $100.

09:01.200 --> 09:03.120
That's good because that says nice gift,

09:03.120 --> 09:05.200
but hey, I'm budget conscious.

09:06.960 --> 09:09.440
I'm all about charging forward as fast

09:09.440 --> 09:12.800
and recklessly as you possibly can.

09:12.800 --> 09:13.040
Sure.

09:13.040 --> 09:13.760
Buy him a house.

09:15.120 --> 09:16.320
Buy him house on DVD.

09:18.320 --> 09:19.040
That's good stuff.

09:19.040 --> 09:21.040
Hey, I'm really friendly

09:21.040 --> 09:22.960
and I like to make lots of different friends.

09:23.520 --> 09:25.440
I consider a lot of people my BFF.

09:25.440 --> 09:29.680
Well, that's a logical fallacy,

09:29.680 --> 09:33.040
but my mom says that it is not possible

09:33.040 --> 09:34.800
for me to have so many BFFs.

09:34.800 --> 09:37.840
How many can I have without being excessive?

09:37.840 --> 09:40.160
And that's from your BFF, Sarah.

09:40.160 --> 09:40.400
Two.

09:41.120 --> 09:41.360
What?

09:42.000 --> 09:43.040
That's how many you can have

09:43.040 --> 09:44.320
when you start to get excessive.

09:44.320 --> 09:45.920
BFF is best.

09:45.920 --> 09:47.440
That's a superlative.

09:47.440 --> 09:48.880
Best friend forever.

09:50.160 --> 09:54.080
You can literally, literally only have one BFF

09:54.080 --> 09:55.600
because even if you had a BFF that you would

09:55.600 --> 09:56.720
eventually fall out with,

09:56.720 --> 09:57.920
you could replace with another BFF

09:57.920 --> 09:58.800
at some point in your life.

09:58.800 --> 10:00.160
This is your BFF.

10:01.680 --> 10:05.440
You're saying the forever part is what is-

10:05.440 --> 10:07.520
If you declare someone your BFF,

10:07.520 --> 10:09.040
you are cryo locked.

10:09.040 --> 10:09.520
Locked in.

10:10.400 --> 10:12.320
I think what I do to get around that,

10:12.880 --> 10:15.200
the loophole I use is to qualify everything

10:15.200 --> 10:17.120
as like this is my best Cincinnati friend.

10:17.120 --> 10:18.640
This is my best Huntington friend.

10:18.640 --> 10:20.560
This is my best friend since second grade.

10:20.560 --> 10:21.200
And I'll tell you,

10:21.200 --> 10:22.800
as someone who's been on the receiving

10:22.800 --> 10:24.000
end of one of those compliments,

10:24.000 --> 10:25.920
they go down real smooth.

10:26.480 --> 10:27.840
Oh no, it ain't about them.

10:27.840 --> 10:28.720
It's about me.

10:28.720 --> 10:30.320
Just making myself feel better.

10:30.320 --> 10:31.200
What were you?

10:31.200 --> 10:33.680
I was his favorite brother in Huntington.

10:35.280 --> 10:36.560
This person isn't talking about

10:36.560 --> 10:38.320
geographically locating these friends.

10:38.320 --> 10:40.640
They're just, can they have more BFFs?

10:40.640 --> 10:41.600
I'm gonna throw this out.

10:41.600 --> 10:42.800
They literally can't.

10:42.800 --> 10:44.640
I think the problem is that it's something

10:44.640 --> 10:45.600
we've talked about before

10:45.600 --> 10:47.040
and that we throw out words

10:47.040 --> 10:48.640
without really thinking about what they mean.

10:49.200 --> 10:50.800
And it's probably that you like these people,

10:50.800 --> 10:51.920
that they are your friends,

10:51.920 --> 10:54.000
but are they your best friend?

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
That seems like a stronger commitment

10:56.880 --> 10:58.960
than you're really making here.

10:58.960 --> 10:59.680
Like people that say,

10:59.680 --> 11:00.720
I love my friends.

11:00.720 --> 11:01.680
I love that guy.

11:01.680 --> 11:02.640
I love this person.

11:02.640 --> 11:04.400
And you're not thinking about what love means.

11:04.400 --> 11:05.680
I think that your best friend

11:05.680 --> 11:09.280
is a very special upper echelon thing

11:09.280 --> 11:11.520
that you should save for someone

11:11.520 --> 11:12.320
that's really important to you.

11:12.320 --> 11:14.400
What I have done as I grew older

11:14.400 --> 11:16.880
is I have sort of moved the goalpost back a little bit

11:16.880 --> 11:20.720
in that I don't have that many friends.

11:20.720 --> 11:23.520
I have many social acquaintances.

11:24.640 --> 11:28.400
I have peers and cohorts and contemporaries.

11:28.400 --> 11:29.440
But I don't have,

11:30.160 --> 11:33.600
I've got like maybe five or six friends.

11:33.600 --> 11:36.400
And then when it comes to like best friends,

11:36.400 --> 11:40.960
I mean, man, if I had to pick,

11:41.680 --> 11:42.480
that'd be tough.

11:42.480 --> 11:43.280
A BFF?

11:43.280 --> 11:44.400
I don't even think I'm old enough

11:44.400 --> 11:45.440
for that kind of commitment.

11:45.440 --> 11:47.120
No, it's a huge commitment.

11:47.120 --> 11:48.080
People have to live in the world

11:48.080 --> 11:50.240
for at least 30 years before you know what's up.

11:50.240 --> 11:52.560
Yeah, just get less friends, everybody,

11:52.560 --> 11:53.920
I think is the trick.

11:53.920 --> 11:55.040
I just, you can't,

11:55.040 --> 11:57.200
I don't care how many friends people have.

11:57.200 --> 12:00.080
I don't care about telling people you love them even.

12:00.080 --> 12:02.960
I would rather someone get divorced

12:02.960 --> 12:05.280
and make those vows and then break them

12:05.280 --> 12:07.680
than to have the English language

12:07.680 --> 12:11.120
just sort of bandied about like a play thing.

12:11.120 --> 12:13.600
If you say someone's your best friend forever,

12:13.600 --> 12:15.840
you can never have another best friend

12:15.840 --> 12:17.360
and you can never like someone,

12:17.360 --> 12:20.800
like the use of the word forever

12:20.800 --> 12:25.840
supersedes any sort of future relationships

12:25.840 --> 12:26.640
that you might have.

12:26.640 --> 12:27.760
That's forever.

12:27.760 --> 12:30.240
And why can't people just be your friend?

12:30.240 --> 12:31.600
Like who's sitting there going,

12:31.600 --> 12:32.640
oh, so I'm just your friend,

12:32.640 --> 12:33.440
not your best friend?

12:33.440 --> 12:34.480
I see how it is.

12:34.480 --> 12:35.280
And you can't,

12:35.280 --> 12:37.680
you're not gonna be my best friend in two infinity?

12:37.680 --> 12:39.360
Oh, okay, fine, whatever.

12:40.160 --> 12:42.160
See if I loan you any DVDs again,

12:42.160 --> 12:43.840
if I loan you any DVDs again.

12:45.440 --> 12:46.800
Justin, I'm interested in another thing

12:46.800 --> 12:49.520
you just said about BFFs being stronger

12:49.520 --> 12:52.080
than a matrimonial bond.

12:52.080 --> 12:54.880
Is there any way that we can incorporate that

12:55.760 --> 12:57.600
into the terminology of marriage?

12:58.560 --> 13:00.480
For instance, would you consider Sydney

13:01.280 --> 13:02.640
to be your best wife forever?

13:03.200 --> 13:04.000
Yes.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.080
Well, Sydney's also my BFF.

13:06.080 --> 13:07.360
I made that commitment.

13:07.360 --> 13:11.760
I bought her a second BFF ring that she wears.

13:11.760 --> 13:13.120
And when you put them together,

13:13.120 --> 13:14.880
it spells best friends forever

13:14.880 --> 13:15.760
and you have half of the heart

13:15.760 --> 13:16.480
and she has half of the heart.

13:16.480 --> 13:17.360
Exactly, yes.

13:17.360 --> 13:17.840
Yeah.

13:17.840 --> 13:19.440
You should marry your BFF.

13:19.440 --> 13:20.400
That's why I'm saying,

13:20.400 --> 13:22.000
don't throw these words around.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.680
Like they don't mean anything.

13:23.680 --> 13:24.000
They do.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.400
I think you should be forced to marry your BFF,

13:26.400 --> 13:28.560
whether it is your partner or your friend.

13:28.560 --> 13:30.080
Oh, man, that's so good.

13:30.080 --> 13:32.720
There should be a ceremony with a priest

13:32.720 --> 13:35.360
and like you get a license and everything.

13:35.360 --> 13:36.960
So like at age 13,

13:36.960 --> 13:39.840
you're like, oh, Michael, you are my BFF.

13:39.840 --> 13:40.880
And then like 20 years later,

13:40.880 --> 13:42.640
it's like, I gotta marry Michael.

13:42.640 --> 13:43.040
Yep.

13:43.040 --> 13:45.120
He's a bro and I'm a bro and I'm not down,

13:45.120 --> 13:46.960
but like, sorry, Michael.

13:46.960 --> 13:48.080
But then the nice thing is

13:48.080 --> 13:50.080
you get all of the wedding presents

13:51.040 --> 13:52.880
and you have a really nice reception.

13:53.440 --> 13:54.080
Sure.

13:54.080 --> 13:54.560
And you know what?

13:54.560 --> 13:56.640
Maybe Michael is the one.

13:56.640 --> 13:58.160
Yeah, maybe that's what you learned.

13:58.160 --> 13:59.440
Maybe that's what you learned about yourself.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.080
Everybody's best friend is Jesus.

14:02.080 --> 14:03.440
That's what I'm saying to you,

14:03.440 --> 14:05.440
is your best friend forever is Jesus.

14:05.440 --> 14:08.160
The only reason you should say someone is your BFF

14:08.160 --> 14:10.640
is if you are trying to show off.

14:11.200 --> 14:12.000
Like if you say,

14:12.000 --> 14:13.680
like, I don't think BFF is something

14:13.680 --> 14:17.440
I would say to make that person feel special,

14:17.440 --> 14:19.360
but I would tell it to somebody else

14:19.360 --> 14:20.560
to make myself feel good.

14:20.560 --> 14:23.840
Like, oh, hero pilot, Sully Sullenberg,

14:23.840 --> 14:24.960
he is my BFF.

14:25.520 --> 14:26.320
And they would think-

14:26.320 --> 14:27.360
Oh, John Stamos?

14:27.360 --> 14:27.840
John Stamos?

14:27.840 --> 14:28.480
He's my BFF.

14:28.480 --> 14:30.480
He is my bestest best friend forever, ever.

14:31.360 --> 14:31.680
Yes.

14:31.680 --> 14:32.720
He's my BFF.

14:34.960 --> 14:36.000
I love John Stamos so much.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.040
Hey, do you guys want to Yahoo?

14:37.040 --> 14:37.600
Yes, please.

14:37.600 --> 14:38.000
Always.

14:39.120 --> 14:41.520
This one was sent in by...

14:43.680 --> 14:44.160
This one.

14:45.600 --> 14:47.680
This one was sent in by Jesse Thorn.

14:48.800 --> 14:49.840
Thank you, Jesse.

14:49.840 --> 14:51.360
It's by Yahoo Answers user,

14:51.360 --> 14:53.360
Miserable Little Smug Bastard.

14:53.360 --> 14:54.480
Oh, oh my.

14:55.200 --> 14:57.120
Who asks, ladies.

14:59.120 --> 14:59.920
Already winning.

15:00.720 --> 15:04.960
Ladies, if someone paid you $300,000 or pounds

15:04.960 --> 15:06.560
to sit on a real human skull,

15:06.560 --> 15:07.360
would you sit on it?

15:08.640 --> 15:08.960
What?

15:10.320 --> 15:12.080
Would you cross your legs?

15:12.080 --> 15:14.960
If you did, you would get an extra 300,000.

15:14.960 --> 15:17.520
I have actually asked this question before.

15:19.840 --> 15:21.600
Sincerely, Skeletor.

15:24.720 --> 15:26.080
Love, Jack Skellington.

15:27.280 --> 15:28.240
So many questions.

15:28.240 --> 15:30.080
First off, ladies,

15:30.080 --> 15:33.760
if you pick the $300,000 above the 300,000 pounds,

15:33.760 --> 15:35.200
then you are a rube.

15:35.200 --> 15:37.760
Yeah, I was going to say conversion rate.

15:37.760 --> 15:38.720
I think maybe that's it.

15:38.720 --> 15:40.160
It's like a deal or no deal thing.

15:40.160 --> 15:43.280
Like you could take the $300,000 or...

15:43.280 --> 15:45.840
Or 600,000 if you cross your legs while you do it.

15:46.800 --> 15:49.040
Or you can get it in pounds

15:49.040 --> 15:51.520
and have to spend 10 minutes getting it converted at a bank.

15:52.160 --> 15:55.040
Yeah, but that's an awkward story to tell the cashier.

15:55.040 --> 15:56.960
Hey, how'd you get these 600,000 pounds?

15:58.160 --> 15:59.600
I sat on a real human skull.

15:59.600 --> 16:04.960
These smell like calcium and taint.

16:05.600 --> 16:07.200
Are you one of those bone jockeys?

16:07.200 --> 16:08.240
Are you a bone jockey?

16:10.080 --> 16:12.080
You're people sick of me.

16:13.040 --> 16:14.880
Hey, Carl, we got another one.

16:16.640 --> 16:17.840
Look at this one.

16:17.840 --> 16:19.680
She sat on a human skull.

16:19.680 --> 16:20.800
She got boned.

16:20.800 --> 16:21.280
She got boned.

16:21.280 --> 16:22.960
And then they all chuckle, chuckle.

16:22.960 --> 16:24.400
There are so many questions.

16:24.960 --> 16:26.000
God damn it.

16:26.000 --> 16:30.880
Is this skull inside of skin and muscles of a living human being?

16:32.160 --> 16:34.080
Is it a last request kind of thing?

16:34.080 --> 16:35.520
Is this how someone wants to get buried?

16:36.400 --> 16:37.200
It's what I'm saying.

16:37.200 --> 16:38.560
Is this a Devo video?

16:40.080 --> 16:41.200
Are we talking about a Devo?

16:41.760 --> 16:43.360
Is this a Devo right now?

16:43.360 --> 16:44.800
Are you pulling a Devo on us?

16:46.160 --> 16:46.480
How much?

16:46.480 --> 16:47.360
Like a bloody Devo?

16:47.360 --> 16:51.680
Why does the price point start out at $300,000?

16:51.680 --> 16:55.760
Why wouldn't you, why wouldn't you haggle up?

16:57.040 --> 17:01.280
I just noticed in the related questions on the sidebar.

17:01.280 --> 17:04.560
This question by miserable little smug bastard.

17:04.560 --> 17:10.080
Ladies, if someone paid you $100,000 or pounds to sit on a real human skull, would you do it?

17:13.600 --> 17:15.120
He's driving a hard bargain.

17:17.920 --> 17:21.040
What do I have to say to get you on this skull

17:21.040 --> 17:22.080
before you leave today?

17:22.080 --> 17:24.000
If you're offended by this question, then ignore it.

17:24.000 --> 17:24.960
Would you cross your legs?

17:24.960 --> 17:26.080
If you did, you would get extra.

17:26.080 --> 17:27.840
It would be the skull of a serial killer.

17:29.600 --> 17:32.320
You laughed that out when you brought it to $300,000.

17:32.880 --> 17:34.640
He's trying to, he's driving a deal.

17:34.640 --> 17:35.680
He's trying to make this happen.

17:35.680 --> 17:37.440
Griffin, what is this username again?

17:38.480 --> 17:39.920
Miserable little smug bastard.

17:40.880 --> 17:43.040
Miserable little smug bastard.

17:43.040 --> 17:45.600
He's like, he's been negotiating this.

17:46.400 --> 17:50.240
For all his foibles, he's a pretty smart negotiator.

17:50.240 --> 17:52.800
He started low and made a serial killer skull.

17:52.800 --> 17:56.160
He's like a, he's like a Ron Popeil.

17:56.160 --> 17:58.240
Like, okay, I'll take out.

17:58.240 --> 18:01.680
It's no longer a serial killer skull, just a regular skull.

18:01.680 --> 18:03.200
Just a real human skull.

18:03.200 --> 18:05.440
And also this set of Sham Wows.

18:05.440 --> 18:08.960
Yeah, I will throw in a solid flavor injector.

18:11.120 --> 18:12.000
Oh God.

18:12.000 --> 18:17.360
Would you slap chop a real human skull for, I'm gonna bump it up to 400K.

18:17.360 --> 18:20.960
You do have to sit on it before, but afterwards,

18:20.960 --> 18:23.040
you'll slap chop it into non-existence.

18:23.040 --> 18:24.240
It would just be dust.

18:24.240 --> 18:28.080
I will sit on two horse skulls for 50K.

18:29.120 --> 18:33.440
You know, I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say that this is one of those circumstances

18:33.440 --> 18:37.360
where I would rather that this were not a hypothetical question.

18:38.000 --> 18:41.440
Because if he had some purpose behind this,

18:41.440 --> 18:44.960
for some reason that makes it okay than him just sitting around wondering.

18:44.960 --> 18:51.120
Travis, the amount of work that he has put into negotiating,

18:51.120 --> 18:55.920
just yelling into the internet, it has to have been resolved, right?

18:55.920 --> 18:58.160
It has to, it has to have happened.

18:58.160 --> 19:00.960
It has to have, has to have happened by now.

19:00.960 --> 19:02.640
Do you realize how much money 300,000?

19:02.640 --> 19:05.360
What would I not do for $300,000 or pounds?

19:05.360 --> 19:07.680
Cause sit on a real human skull?

19:07.680 --> 19:08.160
Yes.

19:08.160 --> 19:09.280
It ain't on that list.

19:10.800 --> 19:12.800
Yeah, I would make the skull.

19:13.360 --> 19:14.080
I would.

19:14.080 --> 19:14.960
Knife and waiting.

19:18.320 --> 19:20.880
I would turn the person into a skull is what I'm saying.

19:20.880 --> 19:22.320
I'm such a fucking sucker though,

19:22.320 --> 19:27.360
because that first time around when he's like 100K,

19:27.920 --> 19:29.200
I would have jumped at it.

19:29.200 --> 19:29.920
You would have taken it.

19:29.920 --> 19:31.680
I wouldn't even thought to hold off.

19:32.400 --> 19:34.480
You gotta check the trade magazines.

19:35.520 --> 19:36.880
What's the going rate right now?

19:37.680 --> 19:43.040
For a, you know, I actually got a Groupon for sitting on a human skull.

19:43.040 --> 19:46.320
Yeah, a bunch of my friends and I are going to do it for 50K.

19:46.320 --> 19:46.800
The problem is-

19:46.800 --> 19:47.600
The same skull?

19:47.600 --> 19:47.920
Yeah.

19:47.920 --> 19:49.120
Yeah, it's the same skull.

19:49.120 --> 19:50.800
So there's always a huge line.

19:50.800 --> 19:51.440
You really gotta-

19:52.640 --> 19:56.160
And after a while, you know, yeah, it gets warm.

19:56.160 --> 19:57.760
That skull is pretty rowdy.

19:58.960 --> 20:01.520
The thing is, is he doesn't even clarify and say like,

20:01.520 --> 20:03.760
you have to be nude or it has to be set.

20:03.760 --> 20:06.880
He just wants you to sit on it, cross your legs and get off and leave.

20:06.880 --> 20:09.040
Can we, let's talk about the crossing the legs thing.

20:09.040 --> 20:11.200
Is he wanting us to incubate this skull?

20:11.200 --> 20:12.960
Like a, like a, like a mama bird?

20:15.040 --> 20:17.040
Keep it secret, keep it safe.

20:17.040 --> 20:18.000
You get $300,000.

20:20.400 --> 20:22.160
But he doesn't say naked.

20:22.160 --> 20:26.080
So what he's saying is just sit on, just-

20:26.080 --> 20:30.320
You just roll up in your mom jeans, sit on it, cross your legs, get off, leave.

20:30.320 --> 20:30.960
Get out of here.

20:30.960 --> 20:31.840
Get your money.

20:31.840 --> 20:36.000
I need to know, can a human skull support the weight of a fully grown adult woman?

20:36.000 --> 20:37.760
It takes like 14 pounds of pressure to-

20:37.760 --> 20:43.280
We are, we are just skeletons with a big egg on top of our necks.

20:45.040 --> 20:46.640
So it's just a big egg in there.

20:46.640 --> 20:49.120
It's just a big, it's just like a big stupid egg in there.

20:49.120 --> 20:54.080
And it's, if a human being, if it was like a tiny, if it was a baby maybe, but-

20:54.080 --> 20:58.720
Oh, maybe he's doing that like age old, like seventh grade science experiment

20:58.720 --> 21:02.320
where you have to like build a bridge to like save an egg.

21:02.320 --> 21:02.880
You know what I mean?

21:02.880 --> 21:05.600
And like, you have to walk across it and see if it destroys the egg.

21:05.600 --> 21:08.080
There was so much goddamn dumb stuff in that sentence.

21:08.080 --> 21:10.480
You just say, it'll take us a week to tear it apart.

21:13.200 --> 21:15.680
It was, it was a seven layer bar of dumb shit.

21:15.680 --> 21:17.040
You know, an egg bridge.

21:17.040 --> 21:18.320
You know, egg bridge.

21:18.320 --> 21:20.880
I saw it on Mr. Wizard.

21:20.880 --> 21:22.640
Five different science projects.

21:22.640 --> 21:24.000
I was like, you know, an egg bridge.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.960
And then you put baking soda on it and-

21:26.960 --> 21:27.920
And then it's a volcano.

21:27.920 --> 21:28.640
It's a volcano.

21:28.640 --> 21:35.840
I'll never forget the events of September 11th, 2001 when a volcano bridge burned down an egg.

21:40.160 --> 21:41.680
Jimmy, your book report sucks.

21:46.160 --> 21:47.360
A book report?

21:47.360 --> 21:48.480
What book is he?

21:48.480 --> 21:52.320
Your book, Jimmy, your book report on the 9-11 commission is the worst I've ever read.

21:52.320 --> 21:53.440
Did you even read it?

21:54.080 --> 21:55.040
You didn't, did you?

21:55.040 --> 21:58.080
Thank you. I did not.

21:59.440 --> 22:00.320
Myth and legend.

22:01.520 --> 22:04.400
You know that in like a hundred years, myth and legend.

22:04.400 --> 22:04.800
That's all.

22:04.800 --> 22:06.560
There will be no excellent records.

22:06.560 --> 22:08.560
It'll be so open to interpretation.

22:08.560 --> 22:10.320
I've seen enough futuristic movies to know.

22:12.480 --> 22:14.080
Oh, God damn it.

22:14.080 --> 22:15.840
Let's stop talking about sitting on skulls.

22:15.840 --> 22:19.360
Because it's literally making my grundle uncomfortable.

22:19.360 --> 22:24.000
Like, just the thought of trying to perch myself on a cranium.

22:24.000 --> 22:25.680
I don't think it would feel good.

22:25.680 --> 22:27.200
No, I wouldn't think so.

22:27.200 --> 22:28.720
But you know what would feel great?

22:28.720 --> 22:31.120
I could buy myself a new grundle with 300k.

22:32.000 --> 22:33.440
Or 300 pounds.

22:33.440 --> 22:34.240
Jesus Christ.

22:35.360 --> 22:37.840
This guy, this fucking guy.

22:37.840 --> 22:40.400
Do you think he's normal in his day to day?

22:40.400 --> 22:42.240
You think it's somebody really nice and well respected?

22:42.240 --> 22:43.440
Do you think it's Tom Hanks?

22:44.160 --> 22:45.600
Oh, couldn't-

22:45.600 --> 22:47.680
Wouldn't you believe it if somebody was like,

22:47.680 --> 22:50.480
yeah, he's a great actor and like, he's a real sweetheart.

22:50.480 --> 22:51.600
He's got this one thing.

22:51.600 --> 22:56.320
My wife and I have a four month old son who will soon be celebrating his first Halloween.

22:56.320 --> 23:00.160
And we are at a disagreement as to what kind of costume our child should wear.

23:00.160 --> 23:04.800
My wife wants him to be dressed as an animal such as a turkey, a skunk, or a monkey.

23:04.800 --> 23:07.840
I would prefer to dress him as something cool and nerdy.

23:07.840 --> 23:09.600
This is where I need your sagely advice.

23:09.600 --> 23:12.320
Can you give me some cool and nerdy costume ideas

23:12.320 --> 23:14.320
with which to put this argument to rest?

23:14.320 --> 23:15.200
And that's from Kevin.

23:15.920 --> 23:17.040
I got a cool nerdy one.

23:17.760 --> 23:20.640
Do a genetic hybrid of all three of those animals.

23:20.640 --> 23:22.320
Go- go as a most skirky.

23:25.520 --> 23:27.200
This is my son Skylar.

23:27.200 --> 23:29.040
He's dressed as a most skirky.

23:29.040 --> 23:30.400
Just- Justin, that is a-

23:31.520 --> 23:33.440
I almost made a furry joke and I didn't.

23:33.440 --> 23:34.000
Would you say-

23:34.000 --> 23:38.160
Are you happy with the level of restraint that I have adopted since I started doing this show?

23:38.160 --> 23:40.640
Yeah, we made a 9-11 joke 30 seconds ago.

23:40.640 --> 23:42.160
We won't make a furry gag.

23:42.160 --> 23:42.480
How is that?

23:42.480 --> 23:43.120
You're welcome.

23:43.120 --> 23:44.320
How's your sensitivity?

23:45.200 --> 23:45.440
Not great.

23:45.440 --> 23:51.520
I'd sit on a most skirky skull for you.

23:51.520 --> 23:53.440
Your son is going to be-

23:53.440 --> 23:57.680
Let's see, if he's four months old now, he'll be like six months at Halloween.

23:59.040 --> 24:01.760
I think he's gonna need to go as Ash from Evil Dead.

24:01.760 --> 24:02.400
That would be good.

24:02.400 --> 24:03.520
A little fake wig.

24:03.520 --> 24:04.640
What about a zygote?

24:06.240 --> 24:08.080
Who would get a real kick out of that?

24:08.080 --> 24:10.880
You could do a combination costume with the mom

24:10.880 --> 24:14.640
and do the alien popping out of the stomach as an alien.

24:14.640 --> 24:20.800
You guys are not thinking like problem solvers right now.

24:20.800 --> 24:26.800
What you gotta do is you gotta have a nerdy, cool costume that is also an animal.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.440
And the answer is Bucky O'Hare.

24:30.960 --> 24:32.160
Oh, yeah.

24:32.160 --> 24:33.440
Bucky O'Hare.

24:33.440 --> 24:33.760
I love it.

24:33.760 --> 24:35.840
Got a rabbit in there, but he's also got a space gun.

24:38.080 --> 24:39.520
Are there any other cool nerdy-

24:39.520 --> 24:42.960
You could go as the cat from Red Dwarf for this one.

24:42.960 --> 24:44.960
Cool nerdy animal.

24:45.360 --> 24:46.560
A ninja turtle.

24:46.560 --> 24:47.120
That is a-

24:47.920 --> 24:48.400
That's a-

24:48.400 --> 24:52.000
I could go as a biker mouse from Mars.

24:52.720 --> 24:53.680
Loving it.

24:53.680 --> 24:57.920
You could go as a llama, but also it's Doctor Who.

24:58.640 --> 24:59.600
Okay, so hold on.

24:59.600 --> 25:00.240
Let's explore this.

25:00.800 --> 25:02.080
Is this a-

25:03.360 --> 25:05.520
Is this a time king?

25:08.080 --> 25:08.800
Yes, it's a time king.

25:08.800 --> 25:09.600
A time king llama?

25:10.240 --> 25:11.520
Time king is a-

25:11.520 --> 25:14.000
No, no, a regeneration-

25:14.000 --> 25:15.360
Okay, Doctor Who-

25:15.360 --> 25:15.920
Okay, so like-

25:15.920 --> 25:16.400
Was dying.

25:16.400 --> 25:17.760
Matt Smith, Doctor Who dies.

25:17.760 --> 25:18.320
Matt Smith dies.

25:18.320 --> 25:19.040
He regenerates as a llama.

25:19.760 --> 25:27.120
The only thing nearby, he funnels the regeneration energy into the llama to try to cast it off,

25:27.120 --> 25:30.560
and it becomes a Time Lord llama, and you dress your baby like that.

25:30.560 --> 25:32.720
Does the llama speak English?

25:32.720 --> 25:35.200
Well, if it's near enough to the TARDIS, of course.

25:35.200 --> 25:35.760
Okay, great.

25:35.760 --> 25:37.360
And translate all languages.

25:37.920 --> 25:41.280
Does it remain on two legs, or does it become like a-

25:41.280 --> 25:42.160
Are we talking about a joke?

25:42.160 --> 25:42.960
Cool.

25:42.960 --> 25:44.080
Does it need to-

25:44.080 --> 25:46.320
Well, it depends on how much ground it needs to cover.

25:46.320 --> 25:49.760
If it needs to cover ground quickly, it will run on all four legs.

25:50.480 --> 25:56.240
I hope someone somewhere at BBC is listening to this, because we've just figured out the

25:56.240 --> 25:57.120
next series.

25:57.120 --> 25:57.680
Yeah.

25:57.680 --> 26:00.400
I've always thought that that show needed a little extra spice.

26:01.040 --> 26:01.920
That's llama.

26:01.920 --> 26:02.640
Yeah, time king llama.

26:02.640 --> 26:06.640
And that spice is apparently a desert pack mule.

26:06.640 --> 26:08.000
Yeah, I think it would go great.

26:08.960 --> 26:10.080
Here's a fun suggestion.

26:10.080 --> 26:11.360
I think it's fun for the whole family.

26:12.160 --> 26:18.560
Dress your kid like a doggy, and then put it in a cage, and then leave it home, and

26:18.560 --> 26:19.920
go get drunk.

26:19.920 --> 26:20.420
What?

26:21.840 --> 26:24.000
Party for Halloween.

26:24.000 --> 26:25.520
The spirits are out tonight.

26:26.320 --> 26:32.160
Me and mom going out, and you're gonna be all right in your cage we made for you.

26:33.920 --> 26:35.360
Just throw some candy in there.

26:35.360 --> 26:36.000
It'll be fine.

26:36.000 --> 26:40.560
Throw some candy in the clothes hanger cage that we made for you.

26:40.560 --> 26:41.440
You just re-bend them.

26:41.440 --> 26:42.320
You just bend them in the bar.

26:42.320 --> 26:43.360
These babies aren't strong.

26:43.360 --> 26:44.240
It won't take long.

26:44.240 --> 26:46.320
Just go out and get drunk with mom.

26:46.320 --> 26:47.360
You guys deserve it.

26:47.360 --> 26:48.240
You've earned the night off.

26:50.560 --> 26:51.280
It's 10 p.m.

26:51.280 --> 26:52.560
Do you know where your baby is?

26:52.560 --> 26:53.440
Yes, in a cage.

26:53.440 --> 26:54.560
He's in the baby dog.

26:54.560 --> 26:55.280
It's okay.

26:55.280 --> 26:56.240
You dress up like a dog.

26:56.960 --> 26:57.760
He's a baby dog.

26:57.760 --> 26:58.880
That makes it better.

26:58.880 --> 27:02.800
The kind of irreparable harm you've done to your relationship by arguing about costumes.

27:02.800 --> 27:04.320
You've got to get on a retreat.

27:04.320 --> 27:08.080
And by a retreat, I mean go to Shakey's and get you drunk.

27:08.080 --> 27:10.000
Make sure you take lots of pictures of that too,

27:10.000 --> 27:14.160
so that when your kid turns 18 and kills everyone he knows,

27:14.160 --> 27:15.840
you can show those pictures to the news.

27:15.840 --> 27:19.360
Just throw some Alpo in the cage and go get your drunk.

27:20.800 --> 27:21.840
Get that drunk.

27:21.840 --> 27:25.680
Mr. Stevenson, I'm sorry I'm placing you under arrest.

27:25.680 --> 27:29.040
Your son was locked in a cage unsupervised.

27:29.040 --> 27:29.680
What the fuck?

27:29.680 --> 27:30.960
That's a dog.

27:30.960 --> 27:31.760
That's a dog.

27:31.760 --> 27:34.560
That is actually your child in a dog.

27:34.560 --> 27:36.880
Well, color me embarrassed, officer.

27:36.880 --> 27:38.000
Look at his nose.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.720
I have painted it brown like a dog's nose is brown.

27:40.720 --> 27:41.200
I have-

27:41.200 --> 27:43.520
Officer, you are terrible at improv games.

27:43.520 --> 27:46.000
I- yeah, you're supposed to say yes.

27:46.000 --> 27:46.640
And we buy-

27:46.640 --> 27:47.200
Yes, and.

27:47.200 --> 27:48.080
Yes, and.

27:48.080 --> 27:50.640
Yes, and my baby's a dog in cage.

27:51.440 --> 27:53.040
Yes, and do you want some of this beer?

27:53.040 --> 27:54.960
I have extra because we have so much in us.

27:57.840 --> 27:58.960
Do you want a brewski?

27:58.960 --> 28:00.160
And we'll forget about this.

28:00.160 --> 28:03.040
And also, forget about the kid, he's fine for another hour or so.

28:04.640 --> 28:05.840
Let's go play some foosball.

28:05.840 --> 28:06.640
Let's go play-

28:06.640 --> 28:08.160
Let's go foos it up, copper.

28:09.840 --> 28:12.560
And then it turns out that the cop is a baby dressed as a cop.

28:14.080 --> 28:15.040
Incepted.

28:15.040 --> 28:18.320
Baby police, you just got busted by the highest authority in the land.

28:20.560 --> 28:21.280
Baby police?

28:21.280 --> 28:23.120
Baby police are the highest authority in the land.

28:23.120 --> 28:23.680
Sentient babies.

28:23.680 --> 28:25.360
We are under baby martial law.

28:27.360 --> 28:28.320
It's adorable.

28:28.320 --> 28:30.000
And also restrictive.

28:31.360 --> 28:33.120
This is a baby police state.

28:33.120 --> 28:35.040
All TVs will watch Nick Jr.

28:38.160 --> 28:40.000
All things will go boring when you hit them.

28:43.120 --> 28:45.280
The cow says moo, you say nothing.

28:46.880 --> 28:48.880
I snap my fingers, you pull out a tit.

28:48.880 --> 28:49.920
This is baby law.

28:52.400 --> 28:53.520
We're running things now.

28:54.640 --> 28:57.920
You know, I would watch a legal drama called Baby's Law

28:57.920 --> 28:59.280
where it's just about a baby lawyer.

29:00.160 --> 29:01.280
Baby law and baby order?

29:02.000 --> 29:02.800
Yeah!

29:02.800 --> 29:03.920
No, if we don't need-

29:05.440 --> 29:05.920
If there's-

29:05.920 --> 29:07.680
Okay, if there's baby martial law,

29:07.680 --> 29:09.520
baby order doesn't have any place in it.

29:11.280 --> 29:12.400
How about baby chaos?

29:14.480 --> 29:15.440
Baby chaos?

29:15.440 --> 29:17.520
That, you know, you mean babyarchy.

29:18.160 --> 29:18.800
Babyarchy.

29:18.800 --> 29:19.600
Babyarchy, yes, thank you.

29:21.840 --> 29:25.760
Babies don't grow up to be adults because this is what you do.

29:25.760 --> 29:28.000
You think about baby anarchy.

29:30.320 --> 29:33.200
Which is adorable and terrifying at the same time.

29:33.200 --> 29:35.200
Hey, can we-

29:37.440 --> 29:41.040
I want to take a brief hiatus here to tell you about the text

29:42.240 --> 29:44.880
that I just got from my father, our father.

29:45.440 --> 29:46.080
Did you guys get-

29:46.080 --> 29:47.120
Me too, yes.

29:47.120 --> 29:52.560
Okay, so he just sent a text that says, in quotes,

29:52.560 --> 29:55.440
it says, what day is it, son? What day?

29:56.800 --> 29:57.680
What could that-

29:57.680 --> 30:01.120
Is that a reference to the hit film We Are Marshall?

30:01.120 --> 30:01.520
I think it is.

30:01.520 --> 30:02.720
I think it has to be.

30:03.440 --> 30:06.560
I think the response to that is football day or something.

30:06.560 --> 30:07.840
No, listen, listen, let's explain this

30:07.840 --> 30:10.880
because people are going to think our dad is like some sort of crazy 9-11 guy.

30:12.080 --> 30:13.760
I don't think he knows it's 9-11.

30:15.680 --> 30:17.920
I think the three of us should probably text him.

30:17.920 --> 30:21.600
I'm texting right now and I'm asking him if he means September 11th.

30:21.600 --> 30:23.280
Okay, hold on, let's all take a moment.

30:23.280 --> 30:26.880
We need to text him back because I don't want our dad

30:26.880 --> 30:28.880
walking through the day with a spring in his step.

30:29.680 --> 30:30.880
It's game day!

30:30.880 --> 30:32.960
Hey, everybody, are you excited?

30:33.760 --> 30:36.160
Okay, my message is sent.

30:36.160 --> 30:39.520
I've been looking forward to today for so long.

30:39.520 --> 30:43.600
Yeah, it seems like it's been 10 years since this last happened,

30:43.600 --> 30:44.640
by which I mean football.

30:46.320 --> 30:49.040
I love football, getting the points, scoring points.

30:49.040 --> 30:50.800
I get all the points.

30:50.800 --> 30:53.680
Should we even address the fact that we are in a family football pool?

30:53.680 --> 30:55.280
It seems like such a ridiculous...

30:55.280 --> 30:56.080
Oh, my God.

30:56.080 --> 30:57.120
No one will believe it.

30:57.120 --> 31:01.680
If someone can give us some advice on what teams are going to win each week.

31:01.680 --> 31:03.680
Do you know how I pick my teams?

31:04.320 --> 31:05.280
How I pick the winner?

31:05.280 --> 31:07.440
I read them out loud to Teresa and said,

31:07.440 --> 31:08.960
which city do you like better?

31:08.960 --> 31:09.440
Oh, yeah?

31:10.000 --> 31:11.120
That was my method.

31:11.120 --> 31:14.720
Now, if I win, God bless it, it'll be awesome.

31:14.720 --> 31:15.840
Take it to the dog track.

31:15.840 --> 31:16.340
Yeah.

31:16.340 --> 31:22.020
I think that the three of us should have some sort of on-air agreement

31:22.020 --> 31:26.100
to the winner should have to do something and the loser should have to do something.

31:26.100 --> 31:26.900
Okay, here's what it is.

31:26.900 --> 31:31.940
Put some skin in the game, because I feel like this is a kind of low pressure situation.

31:31.940 --> 31:37.620
The last one to forget that we're doing it and stop picking teams is the winner.

31:39.460 --> 31:43.460
That hangs in there the longest and continues to make their picks unabated.

31:44.500 --> 31:46.100
I think that would be good.

31:46.100 --> 31:49.940
I failed on that in previous years, and I think that I'm going to hang in there this year.

31:49.940 --> 31:51.940
I think that this is the year I stick with it.

31:51.940 --> 31:54.740
I've already told myself I'm going to watch every single Packers game,

31:54.740 --> 31:55.700
and it's going to be trying.

31:55.700 --> 31:57.220
It's going to be difficult, you guys.

31:57.220 --> 32:00.420
I will watch at least one football game that's not the Super Bowl.

32:01.060 --> 32:02.020
That's my commitment.

32:03.060 --> 32:07.460
I feel like we joke about not watching sports a lot.

32:07.460 --> 32:09.940
I think it's time we reverse it, our position.

32:09.940 --> 32:11.620
We joke about how much we love sports.

32:11.620 --> 32:15.620
We joke about how much we love sports, but we don't know.

32:15.620 --> 32:17.220
Do we actually have to watch sports?

32:17.220 --> 32:19.780
Yeah, I think we should watch more sports is what I'm saying.

32:19.780 --> 32:20.980
Okay, here's what it is.

32:22.020 --> 32:24.260
Somebody on Twitter, after listening to the show,

32:24.900 --> 32:28.020
tell me what team I should follow and why, and I'll do it.

32:28.020 --> 32:30.100
That's how committed I am to this.

32:30.100 --> 32:31.300
You bring it, I'll do it.

32:31.300 --> 32:31.860
I don't care.

32:31.860 --> 32:33.140
You should follow the Reds.

32:33.140 --> 32:33.940
We'll take a vote.

32:34.980 --> 32:36.100
I follow the Reds.

32:36.100 --> 32:38.740
You should also follow the Bengals, maybe, because you also-

32:38.740 --> 32:41.860
It's a new day. We'll let Twitter pick.

32:41.860 --> 32:45.780
Just make sure when you're telling Travis what team he should follow,

32:46.740 --> 32:50.580
use that NBNBM hashtag, and go ahead and put a link out to our sampler.

32:50.580 --> 32:52.420
Bit.ly forward slash smoothing bam.

32:52.420 --> 32:53.220
People love it.

32:53.220 --> 32:54.420
People go crazy for it.

32:54.420 --> 32:59.220
Hey, what I'm doing right now is shilling, and like Kurt Shilling,

32:59.220 --> 33:02.660
popular sports star who I enjoy, still pitching.

33:02.660 --> 33:04.180
See, Griffin, sports.

33:04.180 --> 33:06.580
He pretty sure does not pitch anymore, does he?

33:06.580 --> 33:09.300
I don't think he pitched ever.

33:10.020 --> 33:12.180
Here is what the response from Clint.

33:13.060 --> 33:15.860
Okay, well, I was going for a game day.

33:15.860 --> 33:17.620
Gotta play till the last whistle blows.

33:18.180 --> 33:19.620
But there's your thing, too.

33:19.620 --> 33:38.340
Let's go to the Money Zone.

33:38.340 --> 33:42.180
This week on the Money Zone, the driver is Duodater.

33:42.980 --> 33:44.020
Oh, fuck yeah.

33:45.220 --> 33:46.020
Okay.

33:46.020 --> 33:48.340
Okay. Sorry, go ahead.

33:48.340 --> 33:51.060
You seem wicked excited about duodater.com.

33:51.060 --> 33:52.020
So this is crazy.

33:53.780 --> 33:58.340
My group of friends here in Austin had come up with this idea for a website

33:58.340 --> 34:00.900
where couples would go on dates with each other to make it

34:00.900 --> 34:04.260
like as low-precious a situation as they possibly could.

34:04.260 --> 34:10.420
Only they called it Wings, W-Y-N-G-Z, like wingman.

34:11.220 --> 34:13.940
And then they later found out that that site already existed,

34:13.940 --> 34:15.300
and it's called Duodater.

34:15.300 --> 34:18.420
So Duodater is a, here's the idea.

34:18.420 --> 34:23.540
It can be a little uncomfortable going out, you know, with a complete stranger.

34:23.540 --> 34:30.100
So what you do is you have a friend and you go on double dates with them.

34:30.100 --> 34:34.900
So it's like a dating website, but for like double date instead of late.

34:34.900 --> 34:35.940
Yeah, that's awesome.

34:35.940 --> 34:39.060
Yeah, like pairs of dudes meet pairs of girls, and it's like comfortable.

34:39.060 --> 34:39.700
Your friend's there.

34:40.260 --> 34:42.660
It's a way more, you know, relaxed situation.

34:42.660 --> 34:46.340
And then it all ends up in a hot tub and where it goes from there.

34:46.980 --> 34:50.580
Is there an option for an established guy-girl couple

34:50.580 --> 34:54.980
to meet up with another guy-girl couple and just make a fuck pile?

34:54.980 --> 34:56.660
Do the old swap-rooney.

34:56.660 --> 34:58.180
Oh, at fuckpile.com.

34:58.180 --> 35:00.580
Yeah, you'll want fuckpile.com for that.

35:02.100 --> 35:04.260
Boy, we need to register that one if that's not already.

35:06.180 --> 35:09.540
Yeah, but Duodater is a really cool idea,

35:09.540 --> 35:13.540
and you can go to duodater.com and just get your best bro.

35:13.540 --> 35:20.660
Do work out a hand sign for if you think you're going to be able to get some sex

35:20.660 --> 35:22.740
and you're going to need your friend to peel off.

35:22.740 --> 35:26.900
Like if you're going to need them to split the duo, like you have to have like,

35:27.700 --> 35:31.220
I think you have to have two keys that you insert at the same time and turn

35:31.220 --> 35:36.980
and it splits the duo and then one duo can go make whoopee and the other one can have aqua coffee.

35:36.980 --> 35:41.300
Actually, if you try to do that, a Duodater officer will come and stop you.

35:42.420 --> 35:43.460
It's a baby officer.

35:43.460 --> 35:46.740
You have to preserve the sanctity of their website's moniker.

35:48.580 --> 35:52.740
Also, Duodater, I feel like you owe us some residuals because that is totally wings.

35:54.420 --> 35:55.300
With a Z.

35:55.300 --> 35:55.860
With a Z.

35:57.860 --> 35:59.860
So crazy if they follow us and that's...

35:59.860 --> 36:01.060
Thank you, Duodater.

36:01.060 --> 36:01.860
Thank you, Duodater.

36:01.860 --> 36:02.260
Griffin.

36:02.820 --> 36:04.900
Oh, fuck, I need to write a song for him.

36:04.900 --> 36:05.140
Yeah.

36:05.140 --> 36:07.140
Hold on, Duodater.

36:08.740 --> 36:11.460
See, I just keep wanting to sing about wings and I feel like that that would be...

36:14.500 --> 36:16.180
You could sing about the TV show Wings.

36:21.300 --> 36:24.260
What's better than going on a date with someone you don't know?

36:25.540 --> 36:29.140
Going on a date with two people that you don't know

36:29.140 --> 36:31.300
and one friend who's got your back.

36:31.300 --> 36:33.780
That's the idea behind Duodater.

36:33.780 --> 36:37.860
It was the idea behind Wings first, then they stole it, and that's okay with me.

36:40.900 --> 36:42.420
That's okay with me.

36:44.740 --> 36:49.380
Visit Duodater.com and get your ideas stolen.

36:55.380 --> 36:57.940
They're a bunch of fucking Inception mind thieves.

37:01.140 --> 37:02.020
I'm sure that was...

37:02.020 --> 37:03.540
That was way angrier than I meant it to be.

37:03.540 --> 37:05.780
You think that's what they had planned on?

37:06.820 --> 37:09.700
I'm sorry about the jingle that I wrote for you.

37:11.700 --> 37:14.820
I should have talked more about your goods and services.

37:18.100 --> 37:19.780
Please accept my apologies.

37:23.780 --> 37:27.300
My roommate and I are pretty good friends.

37:27.300 --> 37:31.140
We watch movies and TV together, eat meals together, play games with each other, etc.

37:31.140 --> 37:34.740
But sometimes I just want some time to myself, go in my bedroom and close the door,

37:34.740 --> 37:37.700
but he always stops by to ask what I'm doing if I want to hang out.

37:37.700 --> 37:42.180
I end up making an excuse, like saying I'm not feeling well, I'm working on something.

37:42.180 --> 37:43.940
But really, I just want some peace and quiet.

37:44.660 --> 37:47.220
I don't like lying to him, so is there some way I can tell him

37:47.220 --> 37:49.300
I want to be left alone without hurting his feelings?

37:49.300 --> 37:50.900
That's from Bothered in Berkeley.

37:50.900 --> 37:53.700
So how do I jerk off in a room and with a roommate?

37:53.700 --> 37:54.500
That's what he's saying.

37:56.580 --> 37:57.300
It's tricky.

37:57.300 --> 37:58.100
You gotta fake a nap.

37:59.140 --> 38:00.820
Yep, I'm taking a nap.

38:00.820 --> 38:02.660
It's gonna last about 15 minutes.

38:02.660 --> 38:04.100
It's pretty short for a nap.

38:04.740 --> 38:06.100
But long enough for the other thing.

38:07.540 --> 38:08.180
Don't you tell.

38:08.180 --> 38:09.780
It's a secret forever.

38:09.780 --> 38:10.500
Don't you ever tell.

38:14.740 --> 38:17.140
God, it is, it is, it is, it is tough.

38:18.180 --> 38:22.020
See, I don't know though, because I got lucky because my roommate in college and I

38:23.220 --> 38:26.900
seem to be on the same schedule of like, hang out, hang out, hang out,

38:26.900 --> 38:31.140
and then we break to our rooms and leave each other alone, you know?

38:31.140 --> 38:32.820
Like, we'd watch TV together for a while,

38:33.540 --> 38:35.940
and then we just kind of simultaneously get bored with each other.

38:35.940 --> 38:37.140
What roommate is this?

38:37.140 --> 38:37.780
That was Brent.

38:38.340 --> 38:39.060
Brent O'Floss.

38:39.940 --> 38:41.860
Hit internet personality Brent O'Floss.

38:41.860 --> 38:42.260
Yes.

38:42.260 --> 38:47.700
The problem is you could be friends with your roommate.

38:47.700 --> 38:51.220
You should be friends with your roommate, but you shouldn't be their only friend.

38:52.180 --> 38:54.100
And that sounds like the kind of situation that you have going on.

38:54.100 --> 38:58.100
You shouldn't either, but you should not be FF with your roommate before you get married.

38:58.100 --> 39:02.820
It sounds like, yeah, it sounds like you're kind of filling a lot of roles

39:02.820 --> 39:09.060
for your roommate if he or she wants to spend like every second with you.

39:09.940 --> 39:18.100
Yeah, yeah, I would say that honestly, in this case, I think it's best to be honest.

39:18.100 --> 39:21.060
Just say like, no, I'm just going to hang out by myself.

39:21.620 --> 39:23.700
I just need some time right now.

39:23.700 --> 39:25.940
But what if they're like, oh, come on?

39:25.940 --> 39:27.940
What if you scheduled time?

39:27.940 --> 39:31.540
Like if you said, hey, don't forget tonight, you know,

39:31.540 --> 39:33.380
Tyler's and Tiara's at 10 o'clock.

39:33.380 --> 39:34.580
Oh, I like that actually.

39:34.580 --> 39:37.220
And so that way you've set a time that you're going to hang out.

39:37.220 --> 39:38.420
So up until then.

39:38.420 --> 39:41.460
Well, at that point, Travis, at that point, you are dating them.

39:42.100 --> 39:44.340
Well, yeah, I mean, it sounds like you are anyways.

39:44.340 --> 39:45.780
They're just really needy.

39:45.780 --> 39:48.100
Yeah, and you don't get your thing touched.

39:48.100 --> 39:48.900
You know what you should do?

39:49.700 --> 39:51.300
Oh, synergy.

39:51.300 --> 39:52.980
Do a date with them.

39:52.980 --> 39:53.480
Oh, fuck.

39:53.480 --> 39:58.660
Go on a do a date with them and then they're done with you.

39:59.620 --> 40:00.900
Yeah, I love that.

40:01.700 --> 40:02.900
Go on a do a date with them.

40:02.900 --> 40:06.500
We need to get do a date on this show so we can talk about like,

40:06.500 --> 40:07.940
I want to know about this statistic.

40:07.940 --> 40:09.300
I want to know about the best practices.

40:09.300 --> 40:14.580
Like how often do two dude couples, a dude couple and a lady couple,

40:14.580 --> 40:19.220
or two pairs of oppositely gendered friends, go on a do a date?

40:19.220 --> 40:22.180
Go on a do a date, but with intent?

40:22.180 --> 40:24.740
Like, do you think they assign who gets who at the beginning?

40:24.740 --> 40:26.740
Like I get Susan, you get Margaret.

40:26.740 --> 40:28.820
And then you get down there, you get on the fucking ground,

40:28.820 --> 40:30.980
and then like you want to swap, and then you swap.

40:30.980 --> 40:32.180
I bet that happens like 75% of the time.

40:32.180 --> 40:36.100
What if you did like the two pairs were a guy and a girl and a guy and a girl?

40:36.100 --> 40:38.340
So it's like a female best friend and a male best friend.

40:39.380 --> 40:41.140
Then they're like, they're getting each other's backs.

40:42.020 --> 40:42.980
That could also happen.

40:42.980 --> 40:44.500
There's so many sexy options.

40:44.500 --> 40:45.140
I love this.

40:45.140 --> 40:47.300
I like that one better, actually, because it's like

40:47.300 --> 40:50.100
like that there's not any other option.

40:50.100 --> 40:50.820
There's no other way.

40:50.820 --> 40:52.100
Oh, but you know what?

40:52.100 --> 40:53.540
You guys know how that one ends, right?

40:53.540 --> 40:56.580
Oh, then they realize they're in love with each other.

40:56.580 --> 40:59.220
They actually call that the Tom Hanksman grind.

40:59.860 --> 41:01.060
You can get that combo.

41:01.060 --> 41:02.820
It is at a discounted rate.

41:02.820 --> 41:03.860
Oh, that's nice.

41:03.860 --> 41:06.820
Because you should have realized it in the first place, you dummy.

41:06.820 --> 41:10.020
As much as I appreciate Duodater, I have bad news,

41:10.020 --> 41:12.500
and that is that I have opened up triodater.com.

41:12.500 --> 41:17.540
And just your, your, your fuck pile expands by 50%.

41:19.700 --> 41:21.700
That is a 50% spread on the fuck pile.

41:21.700 --> 41:23.460
We got sex math right there.

41:23.460 --> 41:24.420
You can't deny it.

41:26.900 --> 41:30.100
Oh God, I love the phrase sex math now.

41:30.100 --> 41:30.580
Do you?

41:31.300 --> 41:34.100
Cause I got, I got, I got skeezed out a little bit.

41:34.100 --> 41:36.260
Yeah, a little bit.

41:36.260 --> 41:38.420
The whole fuck while thing is really grossing me out.

41:38.420 --> 41:39.460
I'll tell you why it's grossing me out.

41:39.460 --> 41:41.540
Because when Scriven said triodater,

41:41.540 --> 41:44.580
I almost said you ever wanted to, uh,

41:44.580 --> 41:47.140
date three brothers who do a comedy podcast.

41:47.140 --> 41:47.940
Oh no.

41:47.940 --> 41:48.980
And then Scriven took it to-

41:48.980 --> 41:51.940
Well, you took it to the weird place of sexums.

41:52.980 --> 41:54.820
You want me to like fucking, like,

41:54.820 --> 41:56.820
throw a picnic by the lake and then-

41:56.820 --> 41:58.980
You're talking like a Chase fuck pile.

41:58.980 --> 42:00.420
Yeah, Chase, we're going to sit around.

42:00.420 --> 42:02.580
We're going to, you bring your parasols

42:02.580 --> 42:04.100
while the gentlemen play bocce ball.

42:04.100 --> 42:05.620
What's wrong with a picnic?

42:05.620 --> 42:07.060
Why does it have to be a sexnik?

42:07.060 --> 42:09.140
Why can't it just be a regular picnic?

42:09.140 --> 42:09.940
A dicknik.

42:09.940 --> 42:11.540
You're thinking of a dicknik.

42:11.540 --> 42:12.040
Yeah.

42:14.500 --> 42:17.620
So your roommate, um, just have that conversation with him

42:17.620 --> 42:19.220
and he'll never want to hang out with you again.

42:20.500 --> 42:22.100
Just play this last segment for them.

42:22.100 --> 42:22.580
Yeah.

42:22.580 --> 42:23.460
Say, this is-

42:23.460 --> 42:25.300
I nod at him a lot and smile.

42:25.300 --> 42:26.340
I'm not kidding.

42:26.340 --> 42:27.620
Duo date with him.

42:27.620 --> 42:28.900
Duodater.com.

42:28.900 --> 42:29.620
I love it.

42:29.620 --> 42:30.500
I think it's a great idea.

42:30.500 --> 42:30.980
You know what else is great?

42:30.980 --> 42:32.180
Yeah, get him out of the house.

42:32.980 --> 42:33.540
Here's another great idea.

42:33.540 --> 42:34.740
Get in a circle of people.

42:35.380 --> 42:38.100
This Yahoo answer was sent in by Catherine Mrow.

42:38.100 --> 42:39.300
Mrow.

42:39.300 --> 42:40.020
What?

42:40.020 --> 42:41.300
M-R-A-U-L-E.

42:41.300 --> 42:43.620
If anyone has a better way of pronouncing this name.

42:43.620 --> 42:46.020
Apparently I pronounced somebody's name wrong last week.

42:46.020 --> 42:47.060
I am off my game.

42:48.020 --> 42:50.340
If you can say that last name without sounding like a bear,

42:50.340 --> 42:51.940
I will give you a dollar out of my pocket.

42:53.300 --> 42:54.100
Now what's the question?

42:55.140 --> 42:57.540
It's asked by Yahoo Lady, who asks,

42:59.060 --> 43:00.180
this one might be too gross.

43:00.980 --> 43:01.480
We'll see.

43:02.500 --> 43:06.580
How is that penis put inside vagina will be held all the night during sleep time?

43:06.580 --> 43:09.060
What?

43:09.060 --> 43:12.660
I really don't know if that is a good or bad for my health and my partner's health,

43:12.660 --> 43:15.460
either if he puts his penis inside my vagina all the night.

43:15.460 --> 43:16.100
What a love.

43:19.780 --> 43:21.220
That would be my first time like that.

43:22.980 --> 43:23.940
What?

43:23.940 --> 43:24.180
What a love.

43:24.180 --> 43:24.740
So what are you saying?

43:25.780 --> 43:26.820
What Yahoo Lady?

43:27.940 --> 43:29.220
I'm going to be straight up, guys.

43:29.220 --> 43:31.780
I have a problem of falling asleep while cuddling.

43:31.780 --> 43:32.420
Yeah.

43:32.420 --> 43:33.620
Let alone.

43:34.180 --> 43:34.820
Let me get...

43:34.820 --> 43:35.860
Let me just...

43:35.860 --> 43:36.360
OK.

43:36.360 --> 43:36.860
Night.

43:36.860 --> 43:39.540
Is this good for you?

43:39.540 --> 43:40.500
You set the alarm?

43:40.500 --> 43:41.300
Good night.

43:41.300 --> 43:42.340
Sweet dreams.

43:43.620 --> 43:45.380
Don't shift around too much, please.

43:45.380 --> 43:47.380
Please don't roll over.

43:49.380 --> 43:52.820
I had the weirdest dream.

43:57.860 --> 44:02.260
You cannot imagine the dream I had.

44:02.260 --> 44:03.220
Hey, I love you.

44:03.220 --> 44:03.720
I love you.

44:03.720 --> 44:05.180
I love you, too.

44:05.980 --> 44:07.820
Do you want to fall asleep in this manner?

44:07.820 --> 44:08.620
I just devise.

44:09.260 --> 44:10.700
There's no love that great.

44:10.700 --> 44:11.340
There's no love.

44:11.340 --> 44:14.220
No, it doesn't even seem like sexy at all.

44:14.220 --> 44:17.580
It just seems like utilitarian, like put it in and let's go to bed.

44:18.220 --> 44:19.020
Like, what?

44:19.020 --> 44:19.340
What?

44:19.980 --> 44:20.700
That's weird.

44:20.700 --> 44:21.580
That's very weird.

44:22.220 --> 44:24.700
Listen, I have chronic wiener coldness.

44:28.300 --> 44:30.860
It is a real thing not invented.

44:30.860 --> 44:31.900
Can you help a brother out?

44:31.900 --> 44:35.340
Can you swaddle my wiener, please?

44:36.060 --> 44:37.740
I don't see anything weird about this.

44:37.740 --> 44:38.700
Nothing weird about it.

44:38.700 --> 44:40.380
Just tuck him in and let's go to bed.

44:40.380 --> 44:41.660
Just swaddle me with you.

44:42.220 --> 44:46.780
For $300,000, would you swaddle a skull all night?

44:46.780 --> 44:52.700
Can we please, please, please, God, I've never wanted anything in my life as much as I want

44:52.700 --> 44:55.660
to get my own sex term coined, and that is swaddling.

44:55.660 --> 45:02.540
And that is when you enter a lady and then you just zonk it for eight.

45:03.180 --> 45:04.140
And then doze off.

45:04.140 --> 45:05.980
Get your foot on purpose.

45:05.980 --> 45:09.420
Get your 40 winks and get your tiddly winks.

45:11.100 --> 45:13.660
With swaddling, the new thing that exists.

45:16.220 --> 45:18.220
God, I can't wait till it gets on Seinfeld.

45:18.220 --> 45:18.940
What a love.

45:19.580 --> 45:20.540
What a loving man.

45:20.540 --> 45:21.180
What a love.

45:22.220 --> 45:22.860
I ask it.

45:22.860 --> 45:26.620
Your love is so great that it's killed my belief in it, in the concept.

45:26.620 --> 45:27.980
So I guess it's a pretty good love.

45:28.540 --> 45:30.860
God Vulcanon responded.

45:30.860 --> 45:32.140
I know some friends who do this.

45:33.020 --> 45:33.500
What?

45:33.500 --> 45:36.460
They actually cuddle with him inside her all night long.

45:36.460 --> 45:38.700
I don't see anything wrong with it so long as you're both clean.

45:38.700 --> 45:40.700
No reason to get a yeast infection over this.

45:40.700 --> 45:41.020
What?

45:41.580 --> 45:42.140
What?

45:42.140 --> 45:47.180
Hey, if you want to do this all night, odds are that's not healthy for you.

45:48.460 --> 45:49.340
Here's my problem.

45:49.340 --> 45:57.660
Once you have penetrated, once you have kicked off the swaddle, you are no longer cuddling.

45:57.660 --> 45:59.500
Sorry, that's no longer cuddling.

45:59.500 --> 46:00.460
You're fucking.

46:00.460 --> 46:01.740
You are fucking at that point.

46:01.740 --> 46:03.660
Hey, here's a funny story.

46:03.660 --> 46:07.340
For my formative years, I thought this is what spooning was.

46:09.340 --> 46:11.100
And you were thinking of swaddling.

46:11.100 --> 46:12.220
I was thinking of swaddling.

46:12.220 --> 46:14.140
I confused swaddling and spooning.

46:14.140 --> 46:20.620
Oh, man, you could have been the creator of this new hate sex sensation.

46:20.620 --> 46:23.580
I could have made the t-shirt for everybody.

46:25.740 --> 46:27.340
That is wholly upsetting.

46:27.340 --> 46:29.420
That is entirely upsetting.

46:29.420 --> 46:30.460
You know what's even more upsetting?

46:30.460 --> 46:35.020
That this person, the answerer, claims that their friends tell them about it.

46:35.020 --> 46:37.660
Hey, Debbie and I had a fun night last night.

46:37.660 --> 46:39.340
Hey, let me tell you about my Tuesday.

46:40.460 --> 46:42.860
I'm in no way ashamed or secretive about this.

46:42.860 --> 46:45.900
We went and saw Contagion, got some great Thai food,

46:45.900 --> 46:47.980
and then I fell asleep with my wiener in her.

46:49.020 --> 46:50.140
It was great.

46:50.140 --> 46:51.340
Oh, that's called swaddling.

46:51.340 --> 46:54.300
I didn't even know I thought we invented it.

46:54.300 --> 46:54.780
Hey, Urban Dictionary, what's up?

46:54.780 --> 46:57.580
You're saying it's a new sex sensation that's sweeping the nation.

46:58.620 --> 46:59.260
Swaddling.

46:59.820 --> 47:00.780
Swaddling.

47:02.220 --> 47:04.620
If that's not in Urban Dictionary by Friday, I'll be despondent.

47:04.620 --> 47:05.100
I will burn you.

47:05.100 --> 47:07.660
And then soon it will be in every R&B song.

47:07.660 --> 47:11.180
Or at least every R. Kelly song, at the very least.

47:11.180 --> 47:15.420
Hey, when this episode airs, I'll be in a truck with my dad,

47:15.420 --> 47:18.220
driving from San Antonio, Texas, to Georgetown, Massachusetts,

47:18.220 --> 47:20.460
with a number of stops in between.

47:20.460 --> 47:25.820
Brothers, what are some good ways to keep up morale on the long and tiring road?

47:25.820 --> 47:26.700
And that's from Fred.

47:28.300 --> 47:29.020
That's a long drive.

47:29.740 --> 47:30.700
It is a long drive.

47:30.700 --> 47:33.980
If you get on a long stretch where there's no other cars or people around,

47:33.980 --> 47:36.220
and like, you know, it's a long drive,

47:36.220 --> 47:40.140
and it's just flat, bad land all over the place,

47:40.140 --> 47:43.580
pretend you're in a post-apocalyptic world where you're the only ones left.

47:44.780 --> 47:46.220
I feel like that could be pretty epic.

47:47.180 --> 47:48.380
Keep up morale.

47:48.380 --> 47:50.380
Keep up morale.

47:50.380 --> 47:52.060
Keep up morale.

47:52.620 --> 47:55.660
I don't think that fits the bill.

47:55.660 --> 48:03.020
Just recreate that book, The Road, by Norm MacDonald.

48:04.300 --> 48:05.740
I do not think so.

48:05.740 --> 48:06.940
Rory McClure.

48:06.940 --> 48:08.380
Rold Dollarson.

48:08.380 --> 48:09.740
Rold Roger.

48:09.740 --> 48:11.260
Rold Dr. Seuss.

48:11.260 --> 48:11.900
Tony Hawk.

48:13.820 --> 48:17.420
You know what did it for me on my drive from Chicago to Austin?

48:17.980 --> 48:18.940
Was just podcasts.

48:19.900 --> 48:21.180
My friend was in the car,

48:21.180 --> 48:23.660
and we just listened to podcasts pretty much the entire way down.

48:23.660 --> 48:25.820
And like, I'm not saying, like, listen to our podcasts.

48:25.820 --> 48:27.100
I'm saying listen to-

48:27.100 --> 48:27.820
I'm saying listen-

48:27.820 --> 48:29.260
I am saying listen to our podcasts.

48:29.260 --> 48:30.060
Well, if you-

48:30.060 --> 48:31.740
And now, Travis, when Travis went to-

48:31.740 --> 48:34.780
When Travis went to Louisville to see Point Break Lie with me,

48:34.780 --> 48:37.260
what podcast did you listen to to help pass the time?

48:37.260 --> 48:38.780
Oh, we listened to our own podcast.

48:38.780 --> 48:40.140
I listened to our podcast.

48:40.140 --> 48:41.100
Did you really?

48:41.100 --> 48:41.660
Yes, I did.

48:41.660 --> 48:43.100
Travis, that is creepy.

48:43.100 --> 48:44.140
With his girlfriend in the car.

48:44.140 --> 48:44.860
No, I don't believe so.

48:44.860 --> 48:46.060
With your girlfriend-

48:46.060 --> 48:48.700
Baby, baby, here comes my favorite goof I did.

48:48.700 --> 48:50.300
Listen, I did it so good.

48:50.300 --> 48:52.140
Well, she hadn't heard the episodes,

48:52.140 --> 48:53.500
and she wanted to listen to them.

48:54.780 --> 48:56.940
But you were in the car giving, like, director's commentary?

48:56.940 --> 48:58.220
Like, here's what I was thinking.

48:58.220 --> 49:00.780
No, she would actually ask questions and I'd shush her.

49:00.780 --> 49:02.460
Questions and I'd shush her, like, just listen.

49:02.460 --> 49:03.580
Shush, shush, shush, shush.

49:03.580 --> 49:04.140
Just listen.

49:04.140 --> 49:05.420
We explained all that.

49:05.420 --> 49:08.060
You talked during Justin's part and Griffin's part.

49:08.620 --> 49:09.180
This is my-

49:09.180 --> 49:09.980
Not during this guy's.

49:10.860 --> 49:11.820
Not during this guy's.

49:13.580 --> 49:15.740
I think the best thing about listening to podcasts,

49:15.740 --> 49:17.260
because I just told my friend about this-

49:17.260 --> 49:18.220
Is when you talk in them?

49:18.940 --> 49:22.460
Yes, is that for those long, awkward pauses

49:22.460 --> 49:23.820
where you can't think of anything to say

49:23.820 --> 49:25.020
with your traveling companion,

49:25.740 --> 49:28.620
podcasts are like other people are having the conversation

49:28.620 --> 49:30.860
for you in the car and you don't have to say anything.

49:31.500 --> 49:31.900
It's great.

49:31.900 --> 49:34.700
It's better than music in that respect, I think,

49:34.700 --> 49:37.900
because it fills up the conversation voids.

49:37.900 --> 49:39.980
And it can also give you a lot of new stuff to talk about.

49:39.980 --> 49:41.740
Don't be afraid to pause and talk,

49:41.740 --> 49:43.180
because that can really help pass the time.

49:43.180 --> 49:47.100
Especially with podcasts like How Stuff Works and Radio Lab,

49:47.100 --> 49:49.260
where, like, they're talking about interesting ideas.

49:49.980 --> 49:50.780
You know what I mean?

49:50.780 --> 49:52.940
I think it's great conversation starters.

49:52.940 --> 49:55.180
Sometimes I listen to Radio Lab with a friend,

49:55.180 --> 49:56.780
and then we have entire discussions about

49:56.780 --> 49:58.860
how to pronounce Jad Abumrad's name.

49:58.860 --> 50:01.340
Yeah, I always say Applerod.

50:01.340 --> 50:02.700
I say Abum-RAD.

50:05.100 --> 50:06.220
Here's another one, Meth.

50:06.780 --> 50:07.260
Yeah.

50:07.260 --> 50:09.180
Yeah, makes it fly by.

50:09.180 --> 50:11.340
Just chomp it down like trail mix.

50:13.260 --> 50:14.300
Also, trail mix.

50:15.260 --> 50:16.940
It's a great snack for the road

50:16.940 --> 50:19.580
when you're on the trail, the modern day trail,

50:19.580 --> 50:21.180
the highway mix.

50:22.300 --> 50:22.800
Corp.

50:24.780 --> 50:25.900
Corp's delicious.

50:25.900 --> 50:27.260
Can I do another Yahoo?

50:28.140 --> 50:28.620
Yeah.

50:28.620 --> 50:29.900
We have a lot more ground to cover,

50:29.900 --> 50:31.580
but let's just burn through this Yahoo,

50:31.580 --> 50:34.700
because I feel, you know, it's important.

50:34.700 --> 50:36.780
This one's sent in by Isi Mendenhall.

50:36.780 --> 50:38.220
Thank you, Isi.

50:38.220 --> 50:42.140
It's by Yahoo Answers user Anonymous.

50:42.860 --> 50:43.500
Okay.

50:43.500 --> 50:46.540
Who asks, what are some really sassy baby names?

50:48.700 --> 50:50.940
My baby girl needs to be a diva like me.

50:52.780 --> 50:53.280
Uh-huh.

50:54.380 --> 50:55.420
I'm angry.

50:55.420 --> 50:56.380
Oh, I'm so angry.

50:57.260 --> 50:58.860
That one girl ruined Precious.

51:00.780 --> 51:02.060
Do you want me to go down the list?

51:02.620 --> 51:03.500
That's not sassy.

51:05.420 --> 51:07.340
Do you want to hear some of the suggestions

51:07.340 --> 51:08.460
that Yahoo has provided?

51:09.340 --> 51:09.840
Yeah.

51:11.660 --> 51:14.460
Eden, because she's a cutie patootie.

51:14.460 --> 51:15.340
Cutie.

51:15.340 --> 51:17.660
A cutie patootie.

51:17.660 --> 51:20.700
Sadie, Jackie, Jamie, Maddie, Brooke.

51:20.700 --> 51:21.340
Brooke is good.

51:21.340 --> 51:23.020
These are all regular names.

51:23.020 --> 51:26.220
What about Sarsi?

51:26.220 --> 51:26.780
I spoke too soon.

51:26.780 --> 51:27.500
Hey, guys.

51:27.500 --> 51:28.540
How about SARS?

51:28.540 --> 51:34.300
You can't take the adjective and then throw an R in it.

51:34.300 --> 51:35.100
This is my baby.

51:35.100 --> 51:35.820
She's a diva.

51:35.820 --> 51:36.940
Her name is Durva.

51:36.940 --> 51:37.440
Yeah.

51:39.340 --> 51:41.500
I need a melancholic child name.

51:41.500 --> 51:42.700
Call him Melanchorlic.

51:44.860 --> 51:45.360
Crystal.

51:46.940 --> 51:47.500
Bristol?

51:48.060 --> 51:48.560
Crystal.

51:49.740 --> 51:50.620
All right.

51:50.620 --> 51:51.660
What about Bristol?

51:51.660 --> 51:55.180
Crystal, Chloe, Silver, Giselle.

51:55.180 --> 51:56.380
Wait, jump back.

51:56.380 --> 51:56.940
Silver?

51:56.940 --> 51:57.500
With a Y.

51:57.500 --> 51:58.140
Like the horse?

51:58.140 --> 51:59.500
They have spelled it with a Y.

52:00.860 --> 52:03.180
Yeah, because that's not going to have any jokes about it

52:03.180 --> 52:04.460
whatsoever in grade school.

52:05.500 --> 52:09.340
What about, like, what if you called your baby, like,

52:09.900 --> 52:10.700
Bitch Patrol?

52:14.940 --> 52:15.900
That's sassy, isn't it?

52:15.900 --> 52:23.580
What about, this is my daughter, No Scrubs.

52:23.580 --> 52:24.140
Don't even trip.

52:24.140 --> 52:25.660
This is my baby, Creepin'.

52:26.380 --> 52:28.540
This is my baby, TLC.

52:28.540 --> 52:30.460
Wait, I don't think...

52:32.860 --> 52:35.020
The name of that song wasn't Creepin', was it?

52:35.020 --> 52:36.060
It was just Creep.

52:36.060 --> 52:37.580
I think it was just Creep.

52:37.580 --> 52:37.820
Yeah.

52:37.820 --> 52:39.180
If you name your baby Creep.

52:39.180 --> 52:40.540
This is my baby, Radiohead.

52:42.780 --> 52:43.740
She's sassy.

52:43.740 --> 52:49.500
What if you name your baby after, like, sassy women who have gone before?

52:49.500 --> 52:51.500
And you're like, this is my baby, Joan of Arc.

52:51.500 --> 52:51.660
Yeah.

52:52.460 --> 52:54.060
What if you just called your baby, Uh-Uh?

52:55.820 --> 52:56.700
Not on my watch.

52:58.380 --> 52:58.940
No, sir.

52:59.900 --> 53:00.940
What if you name your baby...

53:03.100 --> 53:03.660
That was it.

53:03.660 --> 53:05.340
Was it those three snaps?

53:05.340 --> 53:06.460
Just three snaps.

53:06.460 --> 53:08.540
If you make your baby, if you want a sassy baby,

53:08.540 --> 53:11.260
give her a name that humiliates people to pronounce.

53:11.260 --> 53:15.980
So if you said, my name is Destiny!

53:15.980 --> 53:16.460
Eeeeeee!

53:16.460 --> 53:18.500
And it's got forty Es at the end.

53:18.500 --> 53:21.740
And some of them are capitalized, and some of them are not, and you have to voice that.

53:21.740 --> 53:23.980
If you don't address me as Destinyeeeeee!

53:24.940 --> 53:26.660
I will not respond.

53:26.660 --> 53:26.380
The.

53:28.220 --> 53:30.060
That sounded like it was, like, 38 Es.

53:31.180 --> 53:33.820
That's gonna be tough to put down on her SAT.

53:34.700 --> 53:35.100
That's gonna be...

53:35.100 --> 53:36.380
I'm gonna need another sheet.

53:36.380 --> 53:39.340
That's gonna be a lot of Bubbles on that crazy matrix.

53:39.340 --> 53:42.400
I don't think that's gonna be a problem.

53:42.400 --> 53:43.400
Destiny!

53:43.400 --> 53:52.480
You know what, I am not gonna undersell Destiny and I'll tell you why.

53:52.480 --> 53:56.880
I don't think her name is going to prevent her from achieving the goals she wants in

53:56.880 --> 53:57.880
life.

53:57.880 --> 54:01.680
I want her to be the first lady president of the United States of America.

54:01.680 --> 54:02.680
Wow!

54:02.680 --> 54:06.520
Madam President Destiny!

54:06.520 --> 54:10.340
I'm a ghost.

54:10.340 --> 54:17.940
Hey, uh, so did you always, uh, think you would be president?

54:17.940 --> 54:18.940
Uh, yes.

54:18.940 --> 54:21.140
I always assumed that I would.

54:21.140 --> 54:23.780
So what would you say that is?

54:23.780 --> 54:26.940
Would, would it, I guess it was my fate?

54:26.940 --> 54:29.860
Uh, my fate to be, no, no, no, no, no, like.

54:29.860 --> 54:30.860
Predisposition?

54:30.860 --> 54:35.820
No, I mean like, what, what, if you thought you were always going to be it, it would be

54:35.820 --> 54:41.300
like your calling, like my calling?

54:41.300 --> 54:42.620
My destiny with Hawaii?

54:42.620 --> 54:43.620
I don't understand.

54:43.620 --> 54:44.620
I don't understand.

54:44.620 --> 54:50.140
Um, do you guys know what day it is?

54:50.140 --> 54:51.140
Game day?

54:51.140 --> 54:52.140
Game day?

54:52.140 --> 54:54.860
It's September, it's the first week of September.

54:54.860 --> 54:55.860
No.

54:55.860 --> 54:56.980
No.

54:56.980 --> 55:01.660
And as it is that, as is our calling, we're going to do things and we're going to talk

55:01.660 --> 55:02.660
about it.

55:02.660 --> 55:06.100
And we're going to talk about the things that are important this month and we're going to

55:06.100 --> 55:07.100
talk about them.

55:07.100 --> 55:08.100
Okay.

55:08.100 --> 55:10.620
It's fall hat month.

55:10.620 --> 55:12.340
What?

55:12.340 --> 55:13.820
It's also happy cat month.

55:13.820 --> 55:15.300
Oh, right.

55:15.300 --> 55:20.660
Now I don't know if that's saying happy cat month, everybody, or your cat looks bummed.

55:20.660 --> 55:27.300
Uh, it is national coupon month.

55:27.300 --> 55:28.300
Obviously.

55:28.300 --> 55:29.300
Yeah.

55:29.300 --> 55:30.300
It is.

55:30.300 --> 55:34.140
Can we talk about, when was the last time you guys used coupons?

55:34.140 --> 55:35.140
I used one literally.

55:35.140 --> 55:37.340
Coupons are the worst thing to ever happen to our economy.

55:37.340 --> 55:40.380
I literally used one last night to buy a chocolate cake at H-E-B.

55:40.380 --> 55:41.380
Really?

55:41.380 --> 55:44.300
Coupons are bullshit and they're ruining our economy.

55:44.300 --> 55:45.700
I don't think that's true, Travis.

55:45.700 --> 55:46.700
It is absolutely true.

55:46.700 --> 55:48.140
That sounds like a dumb thing you're saying.

55:48.140 --> 55:51.980
No, think about those people that walk in and use coupons like on extreme couponing

55:51.980 --> 55:54.500
and they end up paying like ten cents for a hundred dollars worth of food.

55:54.500 --> 55:58.540
I can't think of those things that you just said because they're not, like any rational

55:58.540 --> 56:01.140
person, those things you're talking about are not in my memory.

56:01.140 --> 56:02.140
Thanks.

56:02.140 --> 56:05.500
Dude, I work, I worked retail where people brought in fucking coupons all the time.

56:05.500 --> 56:06.500
Oh, shit.

56:06.500 --> 56:07.500
They're annoying and I hate that shit.

56:07.500 --> 56:08.500
Guys.

56:08.500 --> 56:09.500
What?

56:09.500 --> 56:10.500
It's pleasure your mate month.

56:10.500 --> 56:11.500
Whoa.

56:11.500 --> 56:12.500
No.

56:12.500 --> 56:13.500
You know what?

56:13.500 --> 56:14.500
Have you heard of swaddling?

56:14.500 --> 56:17.500
That seems to be big.

56:17.500 --> 56:19.140
I heard about it on the news last night.

56:19.140 --> 56:20.420
It was on 2020.

56:20.420 --> 56:22.140
Update your resume month.

56:22.140 --> 56:24.740
You're fired.

56:24.740 --> 56:26.820
I think you extrapolated you're fired.

56:26.820 --> 56:30.340
Those are the ones we're working with, it looks like.

56:30.340 --> 56:32.020
Library card sign up month.

56:32.020 --> 56:33.220
Okay, that's good.

56:33.220 --> 56:34.220
You don't have to use it.

56:34.220 --> 56:39.460
I'm having a hard time coming up with things between happy cat month and pleasure your

56:39.460 --> 56:40.460
mate month.

56:40.460 --> 56:42.820
Can we make a combo month?

56:42.820 --> 56:44.380
That's what I'm saying.

56:44.380 --> 56:46.940
Pleasure your fall hat month.

56:46.940 --> 56:48.420
Really get in there.

56:48.420 --> 56:51.060
Really get in there.

56:51.060 --> 56:54.540
When they say fall hat, is that like putting some fake leaves all over it?

56:54.540 --> 56:57.540
Go wild during California wild rice month.

56:57.540 --> 56:58.540
Okay.

56:58.540 --> 57:02.020
Hey, don't tell me how to fucking celebrate my fucking month, September.

57:02.020 --> 57:06.220
Hey, September, you're apparently no one wants this month anymore.

57:06.220 --> 57:08.060
I can't imagine why.

57:08.060 --> 57:12.060
It's not like it's been ruined for celebrations.

57:12.060 --> 57:13.060
And it sucks.

57:13.060 --> 57:15.260
Does not suck because September, it had so much going for it.

57:15.260 --> 57:17.060
It had that earth winning fire jam.

57:17.060 --> 57:18.540
Yeah, that was a good jam.

57:18.540 --> 57:21.900
Think about everybody's birthdays it is today.

57:21.900 --> 57:22.900
It's like-

57:22.900 --> 57:23.900
It's my grandma's birthday.

57:23.900 --> 57:25.380
Your birthday was ruined forever.

57:25.380 --> 57:27.940
Your birthday is actually ruined forever.

57:27.940 --> 57:31.180
Would you rather have a September 11th birthday or Christmas birthday?

57:31.180 --> 57:32.180
Christmas birthday.

57:32.180 --> 57:33.180
Really?

57:33.180 --> 57:34.180
At this point?

57:34.180 --> 57:37.300
At least there's like presents going around everywhere.

57:37.300 --> 57:40.220
Everyone's in a good mood and there's decorations and it's a happy time.

57:40.220 --> 57:42.900
Guys, it's pleasure your mate month.

57:42.900 --> 57:45.900
And you know what that means here at my bim bam.

57:45.900 --> 57:46.900
What?

57:46.900 --> 57:47.900
I don't know.

57:47.900 --> 57:48.900
Actually, I'm kind of afraid.

57:48.900 --> 57:55.540
I have all the hot bedroom tips that you can give.

57:55.540 --> 57:56.820
Oh, okay.

57:56.820 --> 58:01.460
Let me see if I got one here.

58:01.460 --> 58:06.460
Maybe just grab her nipple and just go for it.

58:06.460 --> 58:08.420
My brother, my brother and me.

58:08.420 --> 58:10.580
Have you considered a sex nick?

58:10.580 --> 58:12.140
My brother, my brother and me.

58:12.140 --> 58:17.100
Turn that wiener like a key in a lock.

58:17.100 --> 58:20.100
My brother, my brother and me.

58:20.100 --> 58:21.100
Helicopter.

58:21.100 --> 58:22.100
My brother, my brother and me.

58:22.100 --> 58:23.100
Oh, man.

58:23.100 --> 58:24.100
What?

58:24.100 --> 58:25.100
Never mind.

58:25.100 --> 58:26.100
I'll extract that.

58:26.100 --> 58:27.100
I don't know, Griffin.

58:27.100 --> 58:28.100
I'm not fucking Dr. Ruth over here.

58:28.100 --> 58:29.100
I can't explain it all.

58:29.100 --> 58:30.820
How about this?

58:30.820 --> 58:35.300
Take a moment, look in your mate's eyes, then Superman that ho.

58:35.300 --> 58:36.300
My brother, my brother and me.

58:36.300 --> 58:37.300
Sure.

58:37.300 --> 58:38.300
Can you do that while looking in the eyes?

58:38.300 --> 58:41.140
I don't know the physiology of supermanning.

58:41.140 --> 58:46.380
Can you explain to me what supermanning is and I'll beep the whole thing out?

58:46.380 --> 58:47.380
You promise to beat the whole thing out?

58:47.380 --> 58:48.380
I swear to God I will.

58:48.380 --> 58:49.380
Do you swear?

58:49.380 --> 58:50.380
I swear to Christ.

58:50.380 --> 58:51.380
You Superman that ho, you cunt.

58:51.380 --> 58:52.380
Sorry, radio audience.

58:52.380 --> 58:53.380
That's what Google's for.

58:53.380 --> 58:55.380
I'm going to black out.

58:55.380 --> 59:13.180
That's what you hear when you're doing it so right.

59:13.180 --> 59:17.860
My brother, my brother.

59:17.860 --> 59:19.040
What would R. Kelly do?

59:19.040 --> 59:20.040
My brother, my brother.

59:20.040 --> 59:21.040
Oh, man.

59:21.040 --> 59:22.040
Then do the opposite thing.

59:22.040 --> 59:24.660
Yeah, then do the exact opposite.

59:24.660 --> 59:28.060
For the love of destiny.

59:28.060 --> 59:30.140
How about this?

59:30.140 --> 59:32.980
True pleasure awaits.

59:32.980 --> 59:33.980
That's what-

59:33.980 --> 59:34.980
Is this like tantric shit?

59:34.980 --> 59:35.980
Are you talking like what would Sting do?

59:35.980 --> 59:40.180
I'm talking about tantricize that until you're married to it.

59:40.180 --> 59:45.980
Oh, so what if pleasure mate month means take the whole month and really just get some Clif

59:45.980 --> 59:49.820
bars and some energy drinks and let's do this.

59:49.820 --> 59:54.820
What if pleasure your mate month doesn't mean mate in the American sense but mate in the

59:54.820 --> 59:57.100
British sense where it's just like-

59:57.100 --> 59:59.780
You're saying like, hey buddy.

59:59.780 --> 01:00:00.780
Hey, pal.

01:00:00.780 --> 01:00:05.940
Is this the month for you?

01:00:05.940 --> 01:00:10.060
Why do you have to pleasure him with adult things?

01:00:10.060 --> 01:00:15.580
Or can't you take him just get some fish and chips by me, right?

01:00:15.580 --> 01:00:16.780
Back rubs galore.

01:00:16.780 --> 01:00:22.820
Take your mate to Buffalo Wild Wings and Weck and enjoy some buffalo wings together.

01:00:22.820 --> 01:00:25.180
And that'll be delicious.

01:00:25.180 --> 01:00:26.860
And then later, Superman that ho.

01:00:26.860 --> 01:00:28.260
And then just Superman him.

01:00:28.260 --> 01:00:33.060
By which I mean, he's gonna do it.

01:00:33.060 --> 01:00:34.060
Yuck-o.

01:00:34.060 --> 01:00:39.460
Hey, I want to hear Griffin's last question, but first I want to remind you that this is

01:00:39.460 --> 01:00:41.020
my brother, my brother and me.

01:00:41.020 --> 01:00:46.340
If you have someone in your life that is not listening to our program, send them this link

01:00:46.340 --> 01:00:50.500
bit.ly forward slash it's my bim bam.

01:00:50.500 --> 01:00:52.740
Tweet it, mail it to people.

01:00:52.740 --> 01:00:54.020
I don't care.

01:00:54.020 --> 01:00:56.460
Just get it out there and write it on a piece of paper.

01:00:56.460 --> 01:00:57.460
Get new people on board.

01:00:57.460 --> 01:01:02.340
Transcribe our entire podcast by hand and bind it in a book.

01:01:02.340 --> 01:01:04.420
And then can I have it?

01:01:04.420 --> 01:01:08.260
If you want us to be on your podcast, just let us know.

01:01:08.260 --> 01:01:09.300
We'll do that too.

01:01:09.300 --> 01:01:10.300
We're flexible.

01:01:10.300 --> 01:01:11.300
Yeah.

01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:12.300
We'll do anything.

01:01:12.300 --> 01:01:13.660
We're looking to make some guest spots.

01:01:13.660 --> 01:01:15.900
We'll do a guest spot on your show.

01:01:15.900 --> 01:01:19.780
I'm actually doing a piece on Radio Lab.

01:01:19.780 --> 01:01:22.500
They're doing a whole episode on swaddling.

01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:23.500
Uh-huh.

01:01:23.500 --> 01:01:24.740
I was catching on that quick.

01:01:24.740 --> 01:01:33.860
I found this elderly couple that has swaddled every single night for 90 years.

01:01:33.860 --> 01:01:35.140
They're actually setting a record.

01:01:35.140 --> 01:01:36.140
They've never stopped swaddling.

01:01:36.140 --> 01:01:37.140
They have been swaddling.

01:01:37.140 --> 01:01:40.860
It makes it awkward to walk around the house.

01:01:40.860 --> 01:01:47.180
I am so yucked right now.

01:01:47.180 --> 01:01:50.280
Thank you to everybody who's been tweeting about the show.

01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:53.340
We really appreciate that.

01:01:53.340 --> 01:02:02.420
Thank you to Eminent Emily, Maya Love, Beard of Prey, Brittney Lee, Ducklips513, Chris

01:02:02.420 --> 01:02:08.660
Buehler, AlwaysAmyH, MarshallDBDX, BD Sean, everybody.

01:02:08.660 --> 01:02:16.460
I want to thank SingleGirl1983 because she sent in like 40 Yahoo answers on the tweets.

01:02:16.460 --> 01:02:17.460
Thank you.

01:02:17.460 --> 01:02:18.460
Awesome.

01:02:18.460 --> 01:02:19.460
Thank you.

01:02:19.460 --> 01:02:24.640
SupplySideJesus, Matt Hutchings, so many people are out there spreading the word.

01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:29.400
If you want to do that, use the NBNBA hashtag.

01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:34.300
You would suggest, actually, I would suggest at least make a column of the NBNBA search

01:02:34.300 --> 01:02:42.300
because you, JBPD did that this week, and you will be amazed at some of the things,

01:02:42.300 --> 01:02:48.340
some of the wonders, the delights, the garden of earthly delights that is the NBNBA hashtag

01:02:48.340 --> 01:02:49.740
search.

01:02:49.740 --> 01:02:50.980
So keep an eye on that.

01:02:50.980 --> 01:02:55.780
I really want to thank John Roderick and The Long Winters for the use of their theme song,

01:02:55.780 --> 01:02:59.540
It's a Departure, from the album Putting the Days to Bed, which is fantastic, and while

01:02:59.540 --> 01:03:06.460
you're buying that, John Roderick just started up his own podcast with Merlin Mann.

01:03:06.460 --> 01:03:08.500
It is delightful.

01:03:08.500 --> 01:03:09.940
It is called...

01:03:09.940 --> 01:03:11.580
It's called Roderick on the Line.

01:03:11.580 --> 01:03:12.580
Roderick on the Line.

01:03:12.580 --> 01:03:13.580
Thank you.

01:03:13.580 --> 01:03:14.580
Boom.

01:03:14.580 --> 01:03:18.280
So thank you, John and Long Winters.

01:03:18.280 --> 01:03:21.460
And Merlin Mann, just for being you.

01:03:21.460 --> 01:03:22.460
So Griffin.

01:03:22.460 --> 01:03:23.460
Yeah, I got it.

01:03:23.460 --> 01:03:24.460
I think we're ready.

01:03:24.460 --> 01:03:27.980
The final Yahoo answer was sent in by FaeStyle on Twitter.

01:03:27.980 --> 01:03:28.980
Thank you, FaeStyle.

01:03:28.980 --> 01:03:41.380
It's by Yahoo Answers user Jiraiya, who asks, if you surgically attach two guys together

01:03:41.380 --> 01:03:45.580
in a 69 position, will the pee just go round and round in an endless cycle?

01:03:45.580 --> 01:03:49.700
I'm genuinely upset, is what I am.

01:03:49.700 --> 01:03:52.220
Oh, God, I'm disgusted.

01:03:52.220 --> 01:03:56.900
This is the most upsetting episode, you know?

01:03:56.900 --> 01:03:57.900
Yeah.

01:03:57.900 --> 01:03:58.900
There.

01:03:58.900 --> 01:04:03.820
My brother, my brother, that's where the lips.

01:04:03.820 --> 01:04:14.020
Game day.

01:04:14.020 --> 01:04:15.020
Keep your heart, three stacks.

01:04:15.020 --> 01:04:16.020
Keep your heart, hey.

01:04:16.020 --> 01:04:17.020
Keep your heart, three stacks.

01:04:17.020 --> 01:04:18.020
Keep your heart.

01:04:18.020 --> 01:04:19.020
Man, these girls are smart.

01:04:19.020 --> 01:04:20.020
Three stacks.

01:04:20.020 --> 01:04:21.020
These girls are smart.

01:04:21.020 --> 01:04:22.020
Three stacks.

01:04:22.020 --> 01:04:23.020
These girls are smart.

01:04:23.020 --> 01:04:24.020
Three stacks.

01:04:24.020 --> 01:04:25.020
These girls are smart.

01:04:25.020 --> 01:04:52.020
Three stacks.
