00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.640 --> 00:48.320
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother and Me, an advice show for the modern

00:48.320 --> 00:52.960
era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis of McElroy.

00:52.960 --> 00:57.760
I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin. Squeaky clean hands, McElroy.

00:57.760 --> 01:01.360
Listen, everyone, these are dark and difficult times. They're uncertain,

01:01.360 --> 01:07.120
you know? So I think we need to find the silver linings where we can, and there is a new,

01:07.120 --> 01:11.440
I'm going to say historic human accomplishment this week.

01:11.440 --> 01:12.160
Wow.

01:12.160 --> 01:18.640
Yes, right? Let's focus on what humans can do when we believe. Are you two,

01:18.640 --> 01:22.000
and I guess our audience, are you aware of Britney Spears?

01:23.040 --> 01:27.360
Yeah, I've heard of her and her great music. Toxic is very good.

01:27.360 --> 01:34.560
Toxic is very good. She makes the good music, but you know what? She also has broken a record.

01:36.720 --> 01:47.680
She posted on Instagram that she ran the 100 meter dash in 5.97 seconds, beating Usain Bolt,

01:47.680 --> 01:49.280
apparently, by four seconds.

01:50.000 --> 01:56.400
Well, okay, here's the one thing about that. There was nobody in her way, so that's not exactly a

01:56.400 --> 02:03.920
good... Usain Bolt has to bob and weave around the whole... It's funny, I was excited that you

02:03.920 --> 02:12.800
brought up Britney Spears because it is Britney bitch, and she is here to sort of rearrange our

02:12.800 --> 02:21.360
society in a more idealistic way. She did post something about how we need wealth redistribution

02:21.360 --> 02:30.640
right now, and that's pretty cool coming from Britney Spears and her big snake that she is going

02:30.640 --> 02:34.080
to use to destroy capitalism.

02:34.080 --> 02:37.680
And at this point, she is the fastest human being in recorded history, right?

02:37.680 --> 02:40.080
She's so fast. Big snake.

02:40.080 --> 02:44.160
She could be a modern-day Robin Hood stealing money and then running,

02:44.160 --> 02:52.800
just like a modern day, like if you cross the flash with Robin Hood, she runs up to, I don't know,

02:52.800 --> 02:57.360
is one of the Koch brothers still alive? I think he is. She takes his money bags away,

02:57.360 --> 02:58.800
and then she's gone.

02:58.800 --> 03:06.480
She's gone. Nice try. Good job trying to catch her. It's not going to happen. She has mechanoid legs.

03:06.480 --> 03:13.280
I did not take... If you were to ask me which celeb was going to be Furiosa in this whole

03:13.280 --> 03:19.840
Piccadillo, I wouldn't have guessed Britney. But of course it is Britney.

03:19.840 --> 03:20.800
Of course it's Britney.

03:20.800 --> 03:26.320
Yeah, she is unstoppable. Unstoppable. Nothing has ever stopped her.

03:26.320 --> 03:29.840
Well, stalled. Maybe a stall.

03:29.840 --> 03:32.800
She had a hiccup. She got a hiccup in her giddy-up.

03:32.800 --> 03:33.440
Don't we all?

03:34.000 --> 03:37.440
But look at her now, the fastest human being alive,

03:37.440 --> 03:44.240
redistributing wealth with the help of her intelligent cybernetic snake. Unstoppable.

03:45.760 --> 03:53.840
And I can't wait to see what record she breaks next. Maybe it'll be hot dog eating,

03:53.840 --> 03:59.920
or perhaps world's longest nap. Because after you run, I assume-

03:59.920 --> 04:00.960
You've got to lay down for a bit.

04:00.960 --> 04:02.240
Yeah, you've got to take a nap.

04:02.240 --> 04:02.480
Recharge.

04:02.480 --> 04:08.240
Because if I ran the 100 meters in under six seconds, I would sleep for probably four years.

04:08.240 --> 04:13.840
Can I read the post that Britney put up on Instagram, just a little portion of it?

04:13.840 --> 04:15.040
Yeah, absolutely.

04:15.040 --> 04:22.000
It was a quote from Mimi Zhu, this whole big block of text. At one point it says,

04:23.520 --> 04:26.080
technologies like virtual communication, streaming,

04:26.080 --> 04:28.720
and broadcasting are part of our community collaboration.

04:28.720 --> 04:32.560
We will learn to kiss and hold each other through the waves of the web.

04:32.560 --> 04:33.120
Whoa.

04:33.120 --> 04:38.080
That's fucking great. We will feed each other, redistribute wealth, strike.

04:38.080 --> 04:41.680
We will understand our own importance from the places we must stay.

04:41.680 --> 04:44.080
Communion moves beyond walls. We can still be together.

04:44.640 --> 04:44.960
Damn.

04:46.080 --> 04:52.880
If you seek Amy, I do. And here she is. And she's going to fucking put it all back together

04:52.880 --> 04:57.200
once it all gets broken down. And it's going to get broken down a little bit.

04:57.200 --> 04:58.880
And Christina, we're waiting.

05:00.640 --> 05:03.200
Mandy Moore, we're waiting.

05:03.200 --> 05:08.160
Mandy Moore has always stayed out of it. That's the thing about Mandy Moore.

05:08.160 --> 05:11.040
She's been in the game forever, but keeping it low key.

05:11.040 --> 05:14.880
And I'm like, hey, Mandy Moore, it's time to take a stand on something.

05:14.880 --> 05:16.960
What do you believe in, Mandy Moore?

05:16.960 --> 05:19.600
Jessica Simpson has taken a lot of stands over there.

05:19.600 --> 05:21.280
Too many, some might say.

05:21.280 --> 05:25.360
But she has been willing to die on so many hills.

05:25.360 --> 05:28.960
Samantha Mumba, where are you?

05:28.960 --> 05:29.360
Wait.

05:29.360 --> 05:30.160
Thank you.

05:30.160 --> 05:30.880
Thank you.

05:32.880 --> 05:34.320
Here's a story for you.

05:34.960 --> 05:38.880
Britney Spears' boyfriend reveals she broke her foot while dancing.

05:38.880 --> 05:42.720
But this is from February 2020. Wait, what?

05:42.720 --> 05:43.200
Wait.

05:43.200 --> 05:44.080
Hold on a second.

05:44.080 --> 05:44.480
Wait.

05:44.480 --> 05:48.720
Britney broke her foot a month ago, and now she has just broken the world's record.

05:48.720 --> 05:50.240
What an inspiration.

05:50.240 --> 05:52.080
She's the Flash and Wolverine.

05:52.080 --> 05:57.280
Yeah, anyway, I'm glad we have a beacon to look to.

05:57.280 --> 06:01.440
I wish we could rename 2020 because fill your life with laughter and love

06:01.440 --> 06:08.160
seems like a genuinely irresponsible motto at this point.

06:08.160 --> 06:09.200
If it could just be-

06:09.200 --> 06:11.200
Look to Britney Spears.

06:11.200 --> 06:13.040
2020, look at Britney.

06:13.040 --> 06:15.440
2020, look to Britney.

06:15.440 --> 06:16.800
What's that in the sky?

06:16.800 --> 06:17.760
That shimmering light.

06:17.760 --> 06:18.960
There's a new North Star.

06:18.960 --> 06:19.760
It is Britney.

06:19.760 --> 06:20.800
What's that up in the sky?

06:20.800 --> 06:21.760
It's a snake.

06:21.760 --> 06:23.040
It's a flight attendant.

06:23.040 --> 06:24.880
No, it's Britney Spears, bitch.

06:24.880 --> 06:26.720
Did I say that right?

06:28.400 --> 06:31.440
There was like a nanosecond too long pause, actually.

06:31.440 --> 06:32.080
Oh, damn.

06:33.520 --> 06:35.840
I don't think you can say it's Britney Spears, bitch.

06:36.960 --> 06:39.840
It's just you lose the alliteration.

06:39.840 --> 06:42.480
I don't think you can say that word at all, actually.

06:42.480 --> 06:43.360
Oh, man.

06:43.360 --> 06:44.400
Basically, yes.

06:45.920 --> 06:47.520
Okay, can I say like snitch?

06:48.720 --> 06:49.360
It's Britney.

06:49.360 --> 06:50.240
It's Britney Spears.

06:50.240 --> 06:51.440
She has the snitch.

06:51.440 --> 06:52.400
She's so fast.

06:53.200 --> 06:53.760
She got it.

06:55.280 --> 06:56.880
Wait, I'm seeing this right.

06:56.880 --> 06:58.320
Britney doesn't have a broom.

06:59.840 --> 07:04.480
She's just kicking it and running so fast that she took off like Mario.

07:05.520 --> 07:06.400
Oh, my God.

07:07.680 --> 07:09.760
Wow, it's Britney Spears.

07:10.400 --> 07:11.440
I wish this show-

07:11.440 --> 07:15.280
Do you think we've missed a trick by not making the show more about Britney Spears over the years?

07:15.280 --> 07:15.760
I'm realizing it, yeah.

07:15.760 --> 07:18.000
I find her genuinely inspirational.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.920
We could have been tracking this whole thing.

07:19.920 --> 07:25.440
Because she says she started her first try at the 100 meters in her pose was nine,

07:25.440 --> 07:26.640
which was Usain Bolt.

07:26.640 --> 07:30.240
So she did that and was like, well, I'm as fast as Usain Bolt, but that's not enough.

07:30.240 --> 07:30.960
That's not enough.

07:30.960 --> 07:32.080
I want to lap this dude.

07:33.760 --> 07:38.080
I was looking at a story, now that you brought this to my attention, I did a quick Google,

07:38.080 --> 07:42.960
and they were saying how on her Twitter when she posted this revelation,

07:42.960 --> 07:49.600
several of her followers just posted a comment like, huh, impressive time or great time, Britney,

07:49.600 --> 07:50.560
or impressive time.

07:50.560 --> 07:52.720
So nobody fucking knows anything, huh?

07:52.720 --> 07:57.280
This is a good reminder that fucking nobody knows anything about what they're fucking talking about.

07:57.280 --> 07:57.760
Right.

07:57.760 --> 07:57.760
Right?

07:57.760 --> 08:01.200
Because like, so you do know that it's a good time.

08:01.200 --> 08:04.320
You don't know that she just broke Usain Bolt's world record.

08:04.320 --> 08:08.800
Well, they could infer that it's a good time by the fact that she posted it because it was like-

08:08.800 --> 08:10.000
Right, okay, yes.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.200
And it's a few number of seconds.

08:13.200 --> 08:14.080
It's not a big number of seconds.

08:14.080 --> 08:18.560
Yeah, it wasn't like, I did my first 100 meter day, and it's like a minute and 45 seconds.

08:18.560 --> 08:19.120
But even that-

08:19.120 --> 08:20.720
I have no idea how long 100 meters is.

08:20.720 --> 08:24.400
Yeah, frankly, if I saw that without context, I might be like, oh, cool.

08:25.600 --> 08:26.400
Good job.

08:26.400 --> 08:29.280
But then again, if somebody posted like, I did a mile in two and a half minutes,

08:29.280 --> 08:30.240
I'd be like, oh, great time.

08:31.600 --> 08:34.160
A football field is 100 yards.

08:34.160 --> 08:34.480
Yeah.

08:34.480 --> 08:36.800
I think a meter's bigger than a yard.

08:36.800 --> 08:37.920
A yard's a meter.

08:37.920 --> 08:40.160
A yard is a meter?

08:40.160 --> 08:46.160
A yard to a meter conversion is-

08:46.160 --> 08:47.520
Yeah, it's about a meter.

08:47.520 --> 08:51.280
So she ran a whole football field in, sorry, Travis, four seconds?

08:51.280 --> 08:54.080
Well, 5.97 seconds.

08:54.080 --> 08:56.880
So just a hair under six seconds.

08:56.880 --> 08:57.760
That's quite good.

08:58.320 --> 09:00.240
Well, she's been training for it.

09:01.360 --> 09:03.760
Hey, it doesn't come easy, Griffin.

09:03.760 --> 09:05.680
She didn't roll out of bed and do this.

09:05.680 --> 09:06.240
You know what I mean?

09:06.240 --> 09:07.120
People forget this.

09:07.120 --> 09:07.680
Yes.

09:07.680 --> 09:10.640
They think of her as a performer.

09:11.840 --> 09:16.400
I think it was recently discovered that Rod Stewart has been building model trains

09:16.400 --> 09:17.760
while he's been onto it.

09:17.760 --> 09:18.320
This is like that.

09:19.440 --> 09:21.840
She doesn't want to be known as Britney the Performer anymore.

09:21.840 --> 09:23.280
That is her side hustle.

09:23.280 --> 09:28.160
Her main hustle has been becoming the fastest human being in recorded history.

09:28.160 --> 09:28.400
Right.

09:30.080 --> 09:31.440
How about we do a-

09:31.440 --> 09:35.760
I would like to see Britney Spears race against one of Rod Stewart's trains

09:35.760 --> 09:37.120
for ultimate dominance.

09:37.120 --> 09:37.920
My God.

09:37.920 --> 09:38.880
But a big one.

09:38.880 --> 09:42.880
Do you think he's got a big, like a real life side train he gets to ride around in

09:42.880 --> 09:45.200
and only Rod gets to ride around in?

09:45.200 --> 09:47.760
This is my one for one model train.

09:47.760 --> 09:49.920
We've for sure talked about Rod's trains.

09:49.920 --> 09:50.320
So let's-

09:51.520 --> 09:52.640
No, it was a touchstone.

09:52.640 --> 09:57.600
But like, I'm wondering how Rod is sort of processing.

09:57.600 --> 10:02.160
Because Rod, I'm sure like everybody else, including some of your favorite podcasters,

10:02.160 --> 10:07.600
had some pretty profitable shows canceled by this unpleasantness.

10:08.240 --> 10:11.600
And that's very bad for Rod.

10:11.600 --> 10:15.440
Rod Stewart does free him up to work on the trains pretty good, though.

10:15.440 --> 10:19.680
So I'm wondering sort of where he's at on this whole thing.

10:19.680 --> 10:25.120
Obviously, I'm sure Rod Stewart, not a known psychopath, sees it as a net negative.

10:26.480 --> 10:28.400
There's no question about this point.

10:28.400 --> 10:33.360
After the shows were canceled, he did have to start using the trains to transport actual

10:33.360 --> 10:36.800
cargo to kind of make up some of the money and the differences.

10:37.440 --> 10:39.680
He spent a lot of it on glue, Justin.

10:39.680 --> 10:44.720
A lot of that money went to glue.

10:44.720 --> 10:47.600
Before we hop into the news, sorry, the news.

10:47.600 --> 10:48.480
Oh, Jesus, no.

10:48.480 --> 10:49.200
On our news program.

10:49.200 --> 10:50.080
God, no.

10:50.080 --> 10:54.080
God, Jesus, and God, and Heaven, and Buddha, and all them.

10:54.080 --> 10:54.880
Please no.

10:54.880 --> 11:00.160
No, before we hop into like questions and stuff, did want to give everybody a little

11:00.160 --> 11:01.680
bit of good news.

11:02.480 --> 11:08.960
Jimmy Buffett also had some shows canceled, but he is not stopping.

11:08.960 --> 11:16.240
He's doing a virtual tour, the Cabin Fever, a virtual license to chill the Spring 2020

11:16.240 --> 11:19.760
tour on Wednesdays and Saturdays.

11:19.760 --> 11:26.000
He's going to be streaming out a bunch of live shows for everybody to enjoy at 8 p.m.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.920
Eastern with an encore at 8 p.m.

11:27.920 --> 11:28.880
Pacific.

11:28.880 --> 11:31.120
You can see this at Margaritaville TV.

11:31.120 --> 11:33.120
We're not being paid by Jimmy to say that.

11:33.120 --> 11:34.960
I just want to give everybody a heads up.

11:34.960 --> 11:39.120
If you want to take a chill little break, Saturdays, Wednesdays, 8 p.m.

11:41.200 --> 11:43.040
You got a license to chill right there.

11:43.040 --> 11:44.160
So heads up.

11:44.160 --> 11:45.840
Do not call Justin at 8 p.m.

11:45.840 --> 11:47.760
Eastern, Wednesdays and Saturdays.

11:47.760 --> 11:49.760
And my stories are on.

11:49.760 --> 11:50.260
Yes.

11:51.360 --> 11:54.720
My co-workers and I occasionally order in food for lunch.

11:54.720 --> 11:58.640
The other day I gave a woman $10 for lunch, but she accidentally had it delivered to her

11:58.640 --> 12:00.240
house instead of our office.

12:00.240 --> 12:01.280
Let me be clear here.

12:01.280 --> 12:03.040
These are also from the before time.

12:03.040 --> 12:03.360
Right.

12:03.360 --> 12:03.840
Yes.

12:03.840 --> 12:04.880
Oh, okay.

12:04.880 --> 12:07.600
When are we going to start getting questions from the after time, Travis?

12:07.600 --> 12:12.480
Well, we had a lot saved up, Justin, because we went on the doco and we had recorded a bunch

12:12.480 --> 12:13.040
of episodes.

12:13.040 --> 12:17.280
And I'm not going to burn good questions just because they're from a long-begotten time.

12:17.280 --> 12:19.520
These are shelf-stable questions, Justin.

12:19.520 --> 12:19.760
Yeah.

12:21.360 --> 12:22.640
How are we to advise them?

12:22.640 --> 12:25.280
Are we to advise them in the context of the now?

12:26.640 --> 12:29.440
I haven't forgotten what life was like.

12:29.440 --> 12:31.600
It's not gone from my memory, Justin.

12:31.600 --> 12:32.560
I could dream.

12:32.560 --> 12:34.400
A man can dream.

12:34.400 --> 12:36.080
I'm like the gorilla's an instinct.

12:36.080 --> 12:38.160
I think freedom is just something I dreamed.

12:40.960 --> 12:42.080
Fucking love that play.

12:42.080 --> 12:48.000
Kuba, Anthony Hopkins phoned it in.

12:48.000 --> 12:48.480
Love it.

12:48.480 --> 12:49.040
Good flick.

12:49.040 --> 12:49.600
Good flick.

12:51.600 --> 12:53.280
So we ordered food for lunch.

12:53.280 --> 12:57.360
The other day, I gave a woman $10 for lunch, but she accidentally had it delivered to her

12:57.360 --> 12:59.040
house instead of our office.

12:59.040 --> 13:03.040
She gave back the money and I thought we were square and that she would just eat it for

13:03.040 --> 13:03.680
dinner.

13:03.680 --> 13:08.080
On Monday, she brought my food in for me four days after it was delivered.

13:08.080 --> 13:11.280
I feel bad that she's out $10, but I'm not going to eat it.

13:11.280 --> 13:14.240
Should I pay her for this old food or are we good?

13:14.960 --> 13:15.440
Huh.

13:15.440 --> 13:17.840
That's from Alex in Mini-Snapolis.

13:18.480 --> 13:19.440
P.S.

13:19.440 --> 13:22.960
It was a Middle Eastern salad with chicken and hummus.

13:22.960 --> 13:23.440
Okay.

13:23.440 --> 13:24.560
That ain't gonna hang.

13:24.560 --> 13:26.800
That's that ain't a four day hang, is it?

13:27.360 --> 13:28.240
No.

13:28.240 --> 13:29.280
But what is?

13:29.280 --> 13:30.240
But what is, I guess.

13:30.240 --> 13:31.760
I'm not saying you need to throw.

13:31.760 --> 13:38.640
I'm saying that if you have not been able to witness the life cycle of this food, right?

13:38.640 --> 13:39.840
And then it is brought to you.

13:39.840 --> 13:43.440
There are so many points of failure along the way.

13:43.440 --> 13:44.000
Exactly.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.840
Yes, yes.

13:45.840 --> 13:49.120
It was sitting on the porch at least for a while while you were at work with them.

13:49.680 --> 13:55.440
And then I guess it was over the weekend and you know Susan got weird on the weekend.

13:55.440 --> 13:59.280
And you're fucking your Middle Eastern salad may have been in.

13:59.280 --> 14:05.040
And I apologize, but the splash zone, there's like no fucking way, dude.

14:05.840 --> 14:09.520
We Susan had this food delivered to her home instead of your office.

14:09.520 --> 14:12.800
We don't know a lot about Susan, but I can say one thing concretely.

14:12.800 --> 14:14.080
She's a careless person.

14:14.080 --> 14:14.720
Yes.

14:14.720 --> 14:18.800
And I don't think I don't think this is the sort of person you trust with food hygiene.

14:18.800 --> 14:19.520
Yes, correct.

14:20.080 --> 14:26.880
And I would say, hey, Susan, if you're listening weird move to bring the food in on Monday.

14:26.880 --> 14:29.440
That's a weird one.

14:29.440 --> 14:31.440
Susan knows that this is not news to Susan.

14:31.440 --> 14:32.480
Now, is she out $10?

14:33.840 --> 14:34.240
Yeah.

14:34.240 --> 14:34.560
Yes.

14:35.360 --> 14:37.520
But that's that's good.

14:37.520 --> 14:43.040
But because you need she needs to have some sort of loss.

14:43.040 --> 14:44.880
She needs to experience loss.

14:44.880 --> 14:49.200
She needs to experience a $10 grief right right now.

14:49.200 --> 14:51.760
And then she will be a little bit more careful to

14:52.480 --> 14:54.640
press that little button and order food to the right place.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.040
One of two.

14:57.040 --> 14:59.360
I'm confused by another facet of this question.

14:59.360 --> 14:59.840
OK.

14:59.840 --> 15:01.680
The order was placed by Susan.

15:01.680 --> 15:04.000
Maybe there's more clarity in the question that you've edited out.

15:04.000 --> 15:10.160
But the order was placed by Susan, was it for one meal for Alex?

15:12.160 --> 15:17.280
Did Alex have Susan order one discreet meal for them to enjoy?

15:17.280 --> 15:24.160
Because we've added an unnecessary middle man here, a middle Susan, if you will,

15:24.160 --> 15:27.840
into this process because that is an order you could definitely handle yourself.

15:28.400 --> 15:31.360
The alternative is Susan was placing a bulk order.

15:31.360 --> 15:42.160
And she showed up to her home to find a big, hot, stinky pile of Mediterranean food just on her stoop.

15:42.160 --> 15:45.920
If you knew you were coming back to a house with a porch full of

15:45.920 --> 15:49.840
really any kind of food that had been sitting in the hot sun all day,

15:49.840 --> 15:53.200
like if I was Susan, I would just like five o'clock closing time.

15:53.200 --> 15:54.160
Everybody's leaving.

15:54.160 --> 15:58.080
They see me still at my desk working like, hey, Susan, it's closing time.

15:58.080 --> 16:01.520
And then I would say like, well, no, I don't have a house anymore.

16:01.520 --> 16:03.120
That house is the raccoon's house.

16:03.920 --> 16:07.920
There's raccoons and one big bear that I guess is kind of like their dad.

16:07.920 --> 16:09.280
And they all live together.

16:09.280 --> 16:13.920
And the bear like helps them, bathes them, keeps them clean.

16:13.920 --> 16:14.480
It's really cute.

16:14.480 --> 16:17.040
But like I wouldn't survive in there for even a second.

16:17.040 --> 16:22.800
So oh, but now I showed up after 48 hours and it seems they didn't touch your salad.

16:23.440 --> 16:24.320
Oh, dang.

16:24.320 --> 16:25.440
Oh, sorry, Alex.

16:25.440 --> 16:28.880
We we've all we're all concerned about our health right now.

16:28.880 --> 16:34.400
And but I don't want there's there's food safety can't go on unattended.

16:34.400 --> 16:39.120
I do want to remind folks, if you're between 40 and 140 degrees,

16:39.120 --> 16:40.400
that is the danger zone.

16:40.400 --> 16:46.000
You do not leave food in that zone for more than four hours and then consume it.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.560
And I can't I've been running a lot of different

16:48.560 --> 16:52.400
simulations here in a program I have right on my computer.

16:52.400 --> 16:57.600
And even being generous and saying this is an office where they had lunch at one

16:57.600 --> 17:03.440
and then Susan got home by five, it's still been in the danger zone too long.

17:03.440 --> 17:04.880
You got to trash it for sure.

17:04.880 --> 17:05.200
Trash it.

17:05.200 --> 17:09.600
Real quick, can we just for a moment acknowledge that there is a delivery person

17:09.600 --> 17:12.400
that this food was ordered and they knocked and they didn't answer.

17:12.400 --> 17:14.080
And they were just like, I'll leave it on the porch.

17:14.640 --> 17:17.360
Yeah, like, whoa, that protocol, right?

17:17.360 --> 17:19.040
That can't be protocol.

17:19.040 --> 17:20.160
What else are they going to fucking do with it?

17:20.160 --> 17:20.720
Steal it?

17:20.720 --> 17:21.520
What are they going to do with it?

17:21.520 --> 17:22.800
Are they going to make it snack?

17:22.800 --> 17:24.320
I don't know.

17:24.320 --> 17:25.760
Hey, listen, this is me.

17:25.760 --> 17:28.320
This is like a living will that I'm leaving here.

17:28.320 --> 17:31.920
That if you ever deliver food to me and I don't answer the door, it's yours.

17:32.560 --> 17:36.560
Or if it's me and you're delivering the food in my house and I don't answer the door,

17:36.560 --> 17:40.640
you wait because I will be there at some point and I will be so hungry.

17:42.080 --> 17:42.960
Hey, I have a Yahoo.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.680
Few people sent this one in.

17:45.680 --> 17:49.680
It's an anonymous Yahoo Answers user who I'm going to call Yahoo David.

17:49.680 --> 17:56.720
It asks, how did the first parents know how to take care of their children?

17:59.200 --> 17:59.680
Wow.

17:59.680 --> 18:03.040
I mean, how do parents now know how to take care of their children?

18:03.040 --> 18:05.920
Books, internet, other parents that have been doing it.

18:05.920 --> 18:08.240
Yeah, there's a lot of institutional knowledge out there, Travis.

18:08.240 --> 18:09.520
Songs, nursery rhymes.

18:09.520 --> 18:10.080
Nursery rhymes.

18:10.080 --> 18:10.880
Daniel Tiger.

18:10.880 --> 18:11.680
Old books.

18:11.680 --> 18:15.920
Old books that are kind of more like what not to do.

18:15.920 --> 18:19.920
Bible is pretty much, there's a lot of stuff in Bible that is just like,

18:20.720 --> 18:24.560
hey, cautionary tale, don't do this one with baby.

18:24.560 --> 18:28.720
I bet there was a lot of angels showing up that first time around.

18:28.720 --> 18:30.240
God was like, you're on your own.

18:30.240 --> 18:31.440
And then how many have had babies?

18:31.440 --> 18:33.280
And God was like, oh shit, okay, wait.

18:33.920 --> 18:36.880
Do you go down there and tell them not to give them marbles or whatever?

18:36.880 --> 18:37.360
Right.

18:37.360 --> 18:38.800
There were a few babies before.

18:38.800 --> 18:40.400
God was just like, nope, they'll get it.

18:40.400 --> 18:40.880
They'll get it.

18:40.880 --> 18:41.120
They'll get it.

18:41.120 --> 18:41.600
Just calm down.

18:41.600 --> 18:42.640
They're going to get it.

18:42.640 --> 18:44.000
All right, they're not going to get it.

18:44.000 --> 18:44.800
Get down there.

18:44.800 --> 18:46.320
Get down there.

18:46.320 --> 18:47.840
Okay, Gabriel, just real quick.

18:47.840 --> 18:50.080
Do go down there and tell them to cook that food.

18:50.080 --> 18:50.960
Oh, please.

18:52.720 --> 18:57.600
Do you think that the first people, let's call them Adam and Eve.

18:57.600 --> 19:00.800
Do you think that the first people who are the first parents,

19:00.800 --> 19:05.120
do you think that they maybe started to pretend they got it less than they did

19:05.120 --> 19:06.800
just so they could go on dates and shit?

19:07.360 --> 19:11.760
Like, oh, yeah, I'd love to watch the kids tonight, Gabriel.

19:11.760 --> 19:15.440
Damn, let me just put them into the stove.

19:15.440 --> 19:16.640
No, okay, you're right.

19:16.640 --> 19:17.040
Damn it.

19:17.840 --> 19:19.840
Okay, so we'll be at TGI Fridays.

19:19.840 --> 19:22.480
Here's the hospital's number.

19:24.080 --> 19:25.440
I mean, it would be tough, right?

19:25.440 --> 19:29.280
Because it would be like, God has given us this great baby and we love him so much,

19:29.280 --> 19:33.520
but God has also given us a tree stump with a perfectly baby-sized hole in it.

19:33.520 --> 19:36.640
So I think that that is like the storage unit.

19:37.680 --> 19:40.160
I think that it didn't come with baby.

19:40.160 --> 19:44.960
But I think, I mean, look at, look, perfect fit, like a perfect satisfying fit.

19:44.960 --> 19:49.200
So like, if God didn't want us to jam our baby in this log

19:49.200 --> 19:55.520
and go out to, you know, the cheesecake factory, then why is the hole that way?

19:56.320 --> 19:56.800
Good point.

19:57.680 --> 20:00.640
Do you guys think that there was some point where the first people,

20:00.640 --> 20:02.720
the first parents were like, you think this thing eats?

20:03.680 --> 20:04.960
I think that that is true.

20:04.960 --> 20:11.120
I'm more concerned about just baby just like poops on itself and the ground or whatever.

20:11.120 --> 20:15.760
And then the parents are like, hey, I know he's like little and stuff,

20:15.760 --> 20:18.640
but this baby is not cleaning his butt the way we all clean our butt.

20:18.640 --> 20:20.400
And it's pretty fucked up if you ask me.

20:20.400 --> 20:21.280
It's gross, right?

20:21.280 --> 20:22.320
It's gnarly, right?

20:22.320 --> 20:25.040
We can all agree that, should we talk to him?

20:25.040 --> 20:29.680
Like when I do it, I go outside and we don't have TP yet,

20:29.680 --> 20:33.360
but you know, I'll use a big leaf and this baby doesn't even go outside.

20:33.360 --> 20:36.240
He doesn't know how to use the clamshells?

20:36.240 --> 20:36.560
Nope.

20:38.720 --> 20:39.680
I use the clamshells.

20:39.680 --> 20:42.720
We have these three shells that I use to clean my butt and he doesn't use it right.

20:43.280 --> 20:48.400
Yeah, he doesn't use mammoth bidet, wear a blaster butt with his big gnarly trunk.

20:48.400 --> 20:49.680
I mean, it's a living.

20:49.680 --> 20:50.880
It's a living, but like what?

20:51.920 --> 20:55.200
I think it's kind of rude and I would actually like to ask him to leave.

20:55.200 --> 20:59.360
Can you go ask Fred Flintstone what he did to get his kid to use their bidet?

20:59.920 --> 21:02.400
I mean, Fred Flintstone's kid beats the shit out of him.

21:02.400 --> 21:03.920
Oh wait, that's Barney's kid.

21:03.920 --> 21:04.880
No, that's Barney's kid.

21:04.880 --> 21:06.720
Beats the shit out of him all the time.

21:06.720 --> 21:07.920
Man, that's rough.

21:07.920 --> 21:09.680
Fred's kid's got a cereal deal.

21:09.680 --> 21:12.480
She can't be seen doing that kind of thing.

21:14.560 --> 21:17.360
Here is another question for you, my brothers.

21:17.360 --> 21:20.480
I'm pretty sure my neighbor sells weed and I really want some.

21:21.040 --> 21:22.160
Okay, all right.

21:22.160 --> 21:22.480
Okay.

21:23.200 --> 21:26.400
I've only ever smoked with friends who had their own weed,

21:26.400 --> 21:29.440
but I'm an adult now and I have to get it for myself.

21:29.440 --> 21:32.560
I know very little about him since he's a few years younger than me

21:32.560 --> 21:35.040
and we didn't talk when we were in high school.

21:35.040 --> 21:38.400
I don't have his phone number and we're not friends on social media.

21:38.400 --> 21:42.640
How do I find out if he actually has the good kush for sale?

21:42.640 --> 21:43.520
Please help me.

21:43.520 --> 21:46.640
I really want to blaze it, but I don't know how to get weed.

21:46.640 --> 21:48.720
That's from wannabe loner stoner.

21:48.720 --> 21:50.640
And boy, have you ever come to the right place.

21:51.280 --> 21:55.680
I think it's important that we do a question like this every year or so, annually or so,

21:55.680 --> 21:58.880
just to remind people that we don't fucking know.

21:58.880 --> 21:59.600
We don't know.

22:00.800 --> 22:04.480
It would be, hey, everyone alive?

22:04.480 --> 22:11.760
It would be pretty fucking cool if I knew at this junction, it would be pretty cool.

22:12.640 --> 22:15.600
I'll take it one step further and clarify for those listening.

22:15.600 --> 22:18.320
Not only do I not know where to get weed,

22:19.120 --> 22:23.200
I don't know how to ask somebody where to get weed.

22:23.840 --> 22:27.040
So I am now in a position where it's like,

22:27.040 --> 22:29.920
I don't know where to get it and I'm too afraid to ask

22:29.920 --> 22:33.120
because I'm pretty sure if I walked out to another human being and said,

22:33.120 --> 22:36.480
from whom might I purchase marijuana?

22:36.480 --> 22:38.320
They would be like, oh, you're a cop.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.080
Can you not, Travis, can you not buy it?

22:42.080 --> 22:43.280
Well, I mean, listen.

22:43.280 --> 22:46.240
But hey, you want to cut through the bullshit, Justin?

22:46.240 --> 22:49.440
Yes, I can buy that medical shit and I do.

22:49.440 --> 22:51.120
But I'm saying that's not cool.

22:51.120 --> 22:53.360
That's not a cool feeling, right?

22:54.400 --> 22:55.520
I think it's pretty cool.

22:55.520 --> 22:57.200
I think it's pretty fucking neat.

22:57.200 --> 22:59.600
I like how you can't be arrested and it's not weird.

22:59.600 --> 23:00.320
No, that is cool.

23:00.320 --> 23:01.520
Listen, that's cool.

23:02.080 --> 23:02.560
But I never had-

23:02.560 --> 23:05.120
You could be arrested because the federal statutes have changed.

23:05.120 --> 23:06.640
I know, yeah, it's fucked up.

23:06.640 --> 23:08.000
I'll explain it.

23:08.000 --> 23:09.120
It's the whole thing.

23:09.120 --> 23:11.920
Listen, if they weren't paying attention before,

23:11.920 --> 23:14.560
they sure as fuck are paying attention now, okay?

23:14.560 --> 23:16.160
So go ahead and just go nuts.

23:16.160 --> 23:21.840
As long as your weed dealer isn't selling to nine other people at the same time,

23:21.840 --> 23:24.080
I don't think they can touch you.

23:24.080 --> 23:26.320
Maybe there's one of those scenarios where you can just say like,

23:26.320 --> 23:28.240
hey, do you sell weed?

23:28.240 --> 23:31.920
Because I bet if they do, they're happy for the customers, right?

23:31.920 --> 23:37.040
Like, if you're someone who sells weed, you like selling marijuana to people, right?

23:37.040 --> 23:37.600
You think that's-

23:38.720 --> 23:41.120
You're probably looking for new customers, right?

23:42.080 --> 23:42.880
Right?

23:42.880 --> 23:43.440
You can't-

23:43.440 --> 23:44.720
No, here's the problem, right?

23:44.720 --> 23:46.160
No, this is incorrect.

23:46.160 --> 23:47.440
You're actually wrong.

23:47.440 --> 23:49.040
Because if they're-

23:49.040 --> 23:50.960
I thought I was onto something.

23:50.960 --> 23:51.840
No, you're wrong.

23:51.840 --> 23:57.920
Because if you're wrong, then you're going to put them into a position where they're like,

23:57.920 --> 24:01.840
what am I putting out there in my day to day

24:01.840 --> 24:04.800
where it makes it seem like I'm a person who's selling weed?

24:04.800 --> 24:06.320
And that's not a bad or a good thing.

24:06.320 --> 24:09.600
But it is like, that's not my identity, I don't think.

24:09.600 --> 24:11.600
Like, I don't know that that's my vibe.

24:11.600 --> 24:14.320
It's a weird vibe to put out in the world if I'm not.

24:14.880 --> 24:15.440
Should I?

24:16.240 --> 24:17.040
Like, should I?

24:17.040 --> 24:18.720
Am I missing an opportunity?

24:18.720 --> 24:20.480
Well, but here's the thing.

24:20.480 --> 24:23.840
In this day and age, everybody's selling something, Justin.

24:23.840 --> 24:27.920
So maybe it's not weed, but you're like, hey, do you sell weed?

24:27.920 --> 24:33.920
And they're like, no, but I do make handmade hacky sacks or whatever.

24:33.920 --> 24:34.720
And I'll sell it to you.

24:34.720 --> 24:36.160
And you're like, oh, okay.

24:36.160 --> 24:40.080
So now I need to find somebody who's looking for hacky sacks to trade for weed.

24:40.080 --> 24:44.160
But then you find somebody who's trading hacky sacks for crochet patterns or whatever.

24:44.160 --> 24:48.080
And eventually you will find somebody who will take your,

24:48.080 --> 24:54.160
I don't know, your antique waffles for weed.

24:54.160 --> 24:55.840
Antique waffles is gross, Trav.

24:56.560 --> 24:58.960
Well, I meant like from an antique waffle maker.

24:58.960 --> 25:01.200
I didn't mean like they were super old waffles.

25:01.200 --> 25:08.240
You were just, I feel like you're also risking falling pretty deep into a multi-level marketing

25:08.240 --> 25:08.800
thing.

25:08.800 --> 25:10.240
Like, do you sell weed?

25:10.240 --> 25:12.800
No, but I got some fucking choice lula roe.

25:13.600 --> 25:14.560
I'm so glad you asked.

25:14.560 --> 25:16.800
Let me open my sample case that I always have.

25:16.800 --> 25:18.400
And you thought was full of weed.

25:18.400 --> 25:19.440
But actually it's lula roe.

25:19.440 --> 25:22.640
Here's the thing I would warn you about, Question Asker.

25:22.640 --> 25:25.280
You don't have any connection to this person.

25:25.280 --> 25:27.440
Doesn't sound like you had any interest in being their friend.

25:27.440 --> 25:29.680
Even though it sounds like they live next to you.

25:30.560 --> 25:33.600
And so I think maybe get to know them.

25:33.600 --> 25:41.760
Or if you don't want to do that, don't open up the relationship with one of bartering quality.

25:41.760 --> 25:47.920
Because I think that would put some strain, no pun intended, on the neighborly relationship.

25:47.920 --> 25:48.560
I guess.

25:48.560 --> 25:52.480
Of course you should hold off on sort of bridge building for a little bit.

25:52.480 --> 25:53.600
Just want to get that out there.

25:53.600 --> 25:58.080
You could set up though like maybe a pulley rope system between houses.

25:58.080 --> 25:59.840
Would they send over a little weed?

25:59.840 --> 26:04.160
So the coronavirus little amoebas can fucking Mission Impossible

26:04.160 --> 26:05.840
zip line from one house to the other.

26:07.120 --> 26:08.320
Oh no, Jeremy fell.

26:08.320 --> 26:08.800
It's okay.

26:08.800 --> 26:10.320
There's a billion of us.

26:10.320 --> 26:11.360
Go, go, go.

26:11.360 --> 26:11.680
Fuck.

26:11.680 --> 26:12.320
I forgot.

26:12.320 --> 26:13.200
You're right, Griffin.

26:13.200 --> 26:16.960
I forgot because I had watched Osmosis Jones the other day and that is how that works.

26:18.240 --> 26:21.760
Listen, just get a trench coat, turn on the in your eyes,

26:21.760 --> 26:24.240
and stand outside their window with your bong above your head.

26:27.280 --> 26:29.440
In my lungs.

26:29.440 --> 26:31.680
I need some weed in my lungs.

26:33.200 --> 26:35.200
Yes, indeed, in my lungs.

26:38.080 --> 26:40.080
I hate to interrupt our program.

26:40.080 --> 26:43.920
We do have to take a brief sojourn to the Money Zone,

26:43.920 --> 26:45.600
if you guys would be so kind as to join me.

26:45.600 --> 26:46.320
Okay.

26:46.320 --> 26:47.440
Here, hop on my back.

26:47.440 --> 26:48.480
Travis, you hop on my back.

26:48.480 --> 26:49.680
Griffin, you hop on Travis's back.

26:49.680 --> 26:50.560
Okay, here I come.

26:50.560 --> 26:52.400
Oops, I jumped all the way over the two of you.

26:54.160 --> 26:56.080
And I cleared you by like three or four feet.

26:56.080 --> 26:57.040
Let me try again.

26:57.040 --> 26:57.840
Well, I did it.

26:57.840 --> 26:59.440
Oh wow, even higher that time.

26:59.440 --> 26:59.840
Wow.

26:59.840 --> 27:00.800
Damn powerful jumping.

27:00.800 --> 27:02.320
These damn powerful legs of mine.

27:02.320 --> 27:07.280
If Brittany had my height with her speed, she could upper cut the sun.

27:07.280 --> 27:10.720
She actually just got a call to hear about how high you're jumping,

27:10.720 --> 27:12.000
and she's like, I can beat it.

27:12.000 --> 27:13.600
Hey, I know we're trying to go to the Money Zone,

27:13.600 --> 27:14.720
but Trav, hop off there.

27:14.720 --> 27:15.360
You're going to hurt yourself.

27:15.360 --> 27:15.680
Okay.

27:15.680 --> 27:17.120
I know we're trying to go to the Money Zone real quick,

27:17.120 --> 27:18.720
but Travis mentioned Osmosis Jones.

27:18.720 --> 27:20.000
That brought something to my mind.

27:20.560 --> 27:26.560
There are movies trending right now like Contagion and Outbreak and the like.

27:26.560 --> 27:32.640
I always see it like in my trending shit on streaming platforms or whatever.

27:32.640 --> 27:37.360
And I don't know why a person would watch one of those at this moment,

27:37.360 --> 27:41.920
but how is Osmosis Jones not crept in?

27:41.920 --> 27:47.600
Like how is this not the moment we need Osmosis Jones and his funny uptight pill friend

27:48.240 --> 27:52.800
to like come in and kind of provide maybe even a little bit of a how to,

27:53.520 --> 27:56.320
like a funny joke and animation and loving that,

27:56.320 --> 27:59.520
but like also maybe there's something you can take away there

27:59.520 --> 28:02.480
that would be helpful at this junction in that movie.

28:02.480 --> 28:06.400
I mean, does a white blood cell and one cold pill be, is it SARS?

28:06.400 --> 28:07.520
It's something like that, right?

28:07.520 --> 28:09.040
It's something pretty bad, yeah.

28:11.440 --> 28:15.120
I bet Griffin, David Hyde Pierce has begun every morning

28:15.120 --> 28:18.560
just firing up that trending and being like, let's see, is it?

28:18.560 --> 28:19.760
Oh, no.

28:19.760 --> 28:21.040
Oh, all right.

28:21.040 --> 28:22.400
Not right this second.

28:22.400 --> 28:22.880
All right.

28:24.400 --> 28:25.120
So now?

28:25.120 --> 28:26.880
Yeah, Travis, get back up there.

28:28.240 --> 28:31.200
And then I'm going to get, I didn't jump high enough in that time.

28:31.200 --> 28:32.240
Oh, ow.

28:32.240 --> 28:33.600
You're laying around my back.

28:33.600 --> 28:34.320
Let me try again.

28:35.600 --> 28:38.400
I'll tell you what, I'm going to go get a stepladder.

28:38.400 --> 28:39.440
You guys start without me.

28:41.600 --> 28:43.120
Honey, where's the stepladder?

28:44.080 --> 28:44.880
Oh, no.

28:46.240 --> 28:48.640
That's in the, oh, man.

28:49.440 --> 28:49.920
Did we?

28:49.920 --> 28:51.440
What a vibrant palette.

28:51.440 --> 29:03.840
Oh, shoot.

29:03.840 --> 29:07.920
Here in my neck of the woods, like a lot of places, I think,

29:08.800 --> 29:13.520
dine-in restaurants aren't keeping it going right now.

29:13.520 --> 29:16.080
Can't kind of do that dining in thing.

29:16.080 --> 29:20.640
So it has been a actual, genuine, huge relief to have DoorDash

29:21.600 --> 29:23.200
available in our neighborhood.

29:23.200 --> 29:26.720
And what I have really appreciated is it gives us a way to support

29:26.720 --> 29:30.160
local restaurants here using DoorDash.

29:30.160 --> 29:31.440
It couldn't be easier.

29:31.440 --> 29:36.240
You open up the app, you find what you want to eat, and it's brought to you,

29:36.240 --> 29:40.320
in my experience, always in a speedy, efficient manner.

29:40.320 --> 29:42.240
And they got a lot of, it's not just like the big chains.

29:42.240 --> 29:44.080
They got a lot of local restaurants on there, too.

29:44.080 --> 29:49.600
So you can keep kicking them some money at a time when they really need it.

29:49.600 --> 29:50.880
And you get delicious food.

29:50.880 --> 29:52.960
It's really, it's a win-win.

29:52.960 --> 29:57.280
And all the drivers have been, that cannot be an easy gig right now.

29:57.840 --> 29:58.960
They got to be busy, busy.

29:58.960 --> 30:02.240
And they have been so kind and always a smile.

30:03.120 --> 30:05.280
And it's been a wonderful experience to have.

30:05.280 --> 30:10.320
So right now, our listeners can get $5 off their first order of $15 or more

30:10.320 --> 30:14.000
when you download the DoorDash app and enter code DOREDASH.

30:14.000 --> 30:15.120
Enter code BROTHER.

30:15.120 --> 30:18.800
That's $5 off your first order when you download the DoorDash app in the app store

30:18.800 --> 30:20.640
and enter code BROTHER.

30:21.600 --> 30:22.800
Get me undies.

30:23.440 --> 30:24.240
Go get them.

30:24.240 --> 30:25.120
Acquire them now.

30:25.760 --> 30:27.600
You don't have to leave the house to get them, which is good.

30:27.600 --> 30:28.720
You shouldn't be leaving the house.

30:29.280 --> 30:32.160
And if you're going to be kicking it around the house, you may as well be doing it.

30:32.160 --> 30:37.200
And the most fucking comfortable garments available that are made from the micromodal fabric,

30:37.200 --> 30:44.400
which is a, just, it is a, listen, they use science and synth weave technology

30:45.920 --> 30:48.880
to compile these powerful underpants.

30:48.880 --> 30:53.040
And they got a variety of ranges from extra small to 4XL.

30:53.760 --> 31:01.600
I wear them every day and they keep me safe and dry down there and comfortable down there.

31:01.600 --> 31:03.120
Ooh!

31:03.120 --> 31:04.720
Yeah, it's like my pee-pee's at the spa.

31:04.720 --> 31:10.400
So to get 15% off your first order free shipping and a 100% satisfaction guarantee

31:10.400 --> 31:14.960
that your pee-pee's going to feel like it's in the spa, go to meundies.com slash my brother.

31:14.960 --> 31:16.800
That's meundies.com slash my brother.

31:18.000 --> 31:21.520
You know what I've been doing, fellas, that's really helped keep my spirits up,

31:21.520 --> 31:26.960
is I've been getting dressed every day, even though I work from home and I could keep my PJs on.

31:26.960 --> 31:31.600
I put on some new clothes and let's be honest, a lot of those clothes are coming from Stitch Fix

31:31.600 --> 31:37.520
and it makes me feel like I still have, you know, purpose and things to do.

31:37.520 --> 31:38.960
And then I'm capable of doing that.

31:39.520 --> 31:42.400
I hadn't thought about what a hard adjustment this must be for you, Travis.

31:42.400 --> 31:45.600
I'm sure you miss your crew at the office something fierce.

31:45.600 --> 31:51.120
Well, it's just that, you know, Dwight's always making jokes and, you know, Jim's so serious.

31:51.120 --> 31:52.480
He doesn't think anything's funny.

31:53.760 --> 31:55.120
You know, it's just, I miss them.

31:55.120 --> 31:57.200
Are you still in love with Pam?

31:57.920 --> 32:00.160
Oh yeah, but I don't know how to tell her.

32:00.160 --> 32:01.680
Uh oh.

32:01.680 --> 32:02.800
Travis is Roy.

32:02.800 --> 32:05.520
Travis has casted himself as Roy in the office, I think.

32:05.520 --> 32:07.840
But in my version, I'm the hero.

32:07.840 --> 32:12.320
I'm the blue collar worker who everyone respects because of my heart of gold.

32:12.880 --> 32:14.560
And Jim's a real bully.

32:14.560 --> 32:15.680
And he fucking is.

32:15.680 --> 32:18.560
He is in the real, well, you can't unpack this right now.

32:18.560 --> 32:21.520
Yeah, we can talk about this later, but he, why is he so mean to Dwight?

32:21.520 --> 32:22.960
Okay, not all close.

32:24.160 --> 32:25.600
Now I'm just going to start at the beginning.

32:25.600 --> 32:29.680
So Stitch Fix is a styling service where their personal stylist will ask you questions like,

32:29.680 --> 32:30.160
do you like this?

32:30.160 --> 32:30.960
Do you like this?

32:30.960 --> 32:31.760
Does this fit your style?

32:31.760 --> 32:32.720
What do you think about this?

32:32.720 --> 32:37.200
And as you answer those questions, it is going to hone in your style so that it perfectly

32:37.200 --> 32:37.920
matches you.

32:37.920 --> 32:41.280
Then they send you a box with five items in it.

32:41.280 --> 32:42.080
You try them on.

32:42.080 --> 32:42.960
You say, I like this.

32:42.960 --> 32:43.760
I don't like this.

32:43.760 --> 32:45.600
Oh, can I get this in a different size?

32:45.600 --> 32:50.640

32:50.640 --> 32:51.840

32:52.480 --> 32:56.160
And it's that easy and it's really cool.

32:56.160 --> 32:57.040
I love it very much.

32:57.040 --> 32:58.080

Hi, I'm Dave Hill from before.

33:28.800 --> 33:34.000
And I'm very excited to bring Dave Hill's podcasting incident back to Maximum Fun where

33:34.000 --> 33:35.200
it belongs.

33:35.200 --> 33:41.520
You can get brand new episodes every Friday on maximumfun.org or, you know, wherever.

33:41.520 --> 33:46.560
And while my partner Chris Gersbeck and I might lack in specific subject matter on our

33:46.560 --> 33:49.840
podcast, we make up for in special effects.

33:49.840 --> 33:51.840
Chris, add something cool right here.

33:51.840 --> 33:59.040
Also, we have explosions, animal noises and sometimes even this.

34:01.600 --> 34:05.920
Dave Hill's podcasting incident every Friday on Maximum Fun.

34:05.920 --> 34:07.760
Chris, do another explosion right here.

34:10.080 --> 34:11.840
Real quick, I just wanted to clarify.

34:11.840 --> 34:12.560
Sorry, guys.

34:12.560 --> 34:16.000
It was anthrax that Osmosis Jones and-

34:16.000 --> 34:17.680
Was it really now?

34:17.680 --> 34:18.560
Was it really?

34:18.560 --> 34:23.840
Anthrax, it's Laurence Fishburne voices Thrax.

34:23.840 --> 34:25.600
Okay, but we know what that means.

34:25.600 --> 34:33.600
According to the Wikipedia, a tall, extremely virulent pathogenetic agent and just also

34:33.600 --> 34:40.160
real quick side note, Kid Rock makes a cameo in Osmosis Jones as Kidney Rock.

34:40.880 --> 34:42.640
Oh, I thought you were going to say-

34:42.640 --> 34:43.920
Wow, that's good.

34:43.920 --> 34:50.160
As a nasty little amoeba man, because that's sort of how he presents himself in real life.

34:50.160 --> 34:54.800
And I'm not fucking afraid to say it, that I think Kid Rock is a nasty man.

34:54.800 --> 34:55.040
Yep.

34:56.000 --> 35:01.600
Maybe before all this shit broke bad, the before times Griffin would keep his mouth

35:01.600 --> 35:06.400
shut because he knows how many people out there love and respect Kid Rock, but I think

35:06.400 --> 35:07.200
that now-

35:07.200 --> 35:08.160
He could be listening.

35:08.160 --> 35:11.920
He could be listening, but now I've been emboldened by this tough time.

35:11.920 --> 35:17.520
I've been sharpened and honed like a katana or something, and I'll just say that Kid Rock

35:17.520 --> 35:19.760
sucks shit, and he's a nasty man.

35:19.760 --> 35:20.960
Yep, there it is.

35:20.960 --> 35:23.280
Come on, come on.

35:24.400 --> 35:28.880
I have a Yahoo here, and it's part of a beautiful trend of Yahoos that I've been noticing since

35:28.880 --> 35:30.000
people have been sending it in.

35:30.000 --> 35:38.160
A lot of people sent this one in as well, and it is Yahoos that have been sent in during

35:38.160 --> 35:39.120
the during times.

35:39.120 --> 35:45.040
Okay. This one is from March 20th, so I think we can safely consider that the during times.

35:46.240 --> 35:54.000
And it's Dylan, and Dylan asks, my dad bought the nasty hamburger buns.

35:59.040 --> 36:05.280
So everybody is suffering from this in their own way, some much, much worse and much more

36:05.280 --> 36:09.600
serious than others, and we would encourage you to find ways to support the people out

36:09.600 --> 36:10.560
there who really need your help.

36:10.560 --> 36:16.400
But the good news is that none of those people are on Yahoo Answers, because Dylan says,

36:16.400 --> 36:18.640
my dad bought the nasty hamburger buns.

36:20.640 --> 36:22.320
I hate when he does this.

36:25.920 --> 36:27.120
I hate when he does this.

36:27.120 --> 36:30.720
When he grills hamburgers, there's a specific type of buns I like him to buy.

36:31.280 --> 36:33.600
They are small, light buns.

36:33.600 --> 36:35.440
Yes, yes.

36:35.440 --> 36:37.840
I like light buns and I cannot lie.

36:40.400 --> 36:46.320
I like the way he's put in commas here, because it says, they are small, light, buns.

36:47.120 --> 36:48.480
These buns are buns.

36:48.480 --> 36:51.680
Since the burgers are never too big, they get smaller when you cook them.

36:51.680 --> 36:53.280
That's just burger physiology.

36:53.920 --> 36:55.840
He bought the freaking big dark buns.

36:55.840 --> 37:00.320
The bun is bigger than the entire patty, which means when I bite, I will be biting into the

37:00.320 --> 37:03.600
bun and it's dark, which I don't like the dark buns he buys.

37:03.600 --> 37:04.320
What should I do?

37:04.880 --> 37:06.560
Oh, man.

37:08.320 --> 37:10.560
I mean, I hate to see that.

37:10.560 --> 37:17.200
I think it's important to be, you know, not necessarily conservative, but like thoughtful

37:17.200 --> 37:24.480
about the food that you have and the food that is able to be circulated among the community.

37:24.480 --> 37:29.120
But at the same time, biting into a big burger and getting worse.

37:29.120 --> 37:30.240
And where's the beef?

37:30.240 --> 37:34.240
Like, oh, man, is there anything fucking worse than that?

37:35.680 --> 37:41.040
My heart goes out to this person's father.

37:42.000 --> 37:44.720
The supplies or the selection is pretty slim.

37:45.840 --> 37:50.000
I went to the grocery store recently and brought home whole wheat tortillas.

37:50.000 --> 37:54.880
And you would have thought that I had vivisected a baby deer in front of my family because

37:54.880 --> 37:58.560
they were met with such disdain and utter disgust.

37:58.560 --> 38:02.640
These whole wheat tortillas that no one wanted and sit untouched.

38:03.440 --> 38:09.600
I brought home a big pack of Uncle Ben's dirty rice, an instant pack.

38:10.560 --> 38:12.400
And Rachel was like, what the fuck?

38:12.400 --> 38:16.160
I was like, yeah, man, maybe we're a dirty rice family now.

38:16.160 --> 38:21.360
Maybe we're going to have a season of jambalaya.

38:21.360 --> 38:23.440
And that is how we will look back on this.

38:23.440 --> 38:25.520
But the big buns, guys, is there anything we can do?

38:25.520 --> 38:28.800
Obviously, we can get we can cut the buns, but then the edges are bigger.

38:28.800 --> 38:31.200
I mean, that compromises the integrity.

38:32.080 --> 38:33.680
The daddy can't make bigger meat.

38:33.680 --> 38:35.360
The daddy knows how to make one type of burger.

38:35.360 --> 38:38.960
It's like you can't you can't you can't unprogram that.

38:39.680 --> 38:40.560
And you know what?

38:40.560 --> 38:41.600
Me like a slider.

38:42.560 --> 38:43.760
Travy like a slider.

38:43.760 --> 38:45.120
Travy like a slider.

38:45.120 --> 38:46.560
Make me feel like big man.

38:47.120 --> 38:50.320
When Travis first went to Applebee's and they were like, hey, man, we got sliders.

38:50.320 --> 38:51.280
And he's like, what's sliders?

38:51.280 --> 38:51.680
The show.

38:51.680 --> 38:53.120
I love that Jerry O'Connell kick ass.

38:54.240 --> 38:55.360
And they were like, no, no, no.

38:55.360 --> 38:57.680
It's like three burgers that you eat instead of one.

38:57.680 --> 39:02.560
And then Travis was like, but that's my whole life now.

39:03.200 --> 39:05.040
Three burgers instead of one burger?

39:05.040 --> 39:06.880
OK, where do I sign up?

39:06.880 --> 39:10.080
Is there some sort of license I need some sort of registry I join?

39:10.080 --> 39:15.920
No, but if there is some kind of slider agency, I would love that.

39:15.920 --> 39:17.760
Did you say Bigger Burger already?

39:17.760 --> 39:18.720
Did I miss Bigger Burger?

39:18.720 --> 39:21.200
We talked about Bigger Burger.

39:21.200 --> 39:23.440
Yeah, I just want to make sure I got in with Bigger Burger.

39:23.440 --> 39:24.720
But we talked about Bigger.

39:24.720 --> 39:25.200
We said.

39:25.200 --> 39:29.600
Yeah, but I don't want people to wonder if I thought Bigger Burger was a good idea

39:29.600 --> 39:36.080
because I hadn't agreed, you know, vociferously that like Bigger Burger is a great play.

39:36.080 --> 39:40.000
OK, because at least I did the whole me like a slider thing.

39:40.560 --> 39:42.880
Bigger, but the slider is a smaller burger.

39:42.880 --> 39:45.120
So I think that's what I'm saying is I don't know.

39:45.120 --> 39:46.320
But I don't want a big.

39:46.320 --> 39:47.200
No, Justin, sorry.

39:47.840 --> 39:49.120
Can you step over here, please?

39:50.720 --> 39:51.440
You guys go do that.

39:52.320 --> 39:54.400
Can I close the door if this is going to be bad?

39:54.400 --> 39:54.960
You close the door.

39:54.960 --> 39:57.200
I'll keep doing the podcast while you guys sort of talk it out.

39:58.800 --> 40:02.720
Let me look at the camera real quick so they know that it's like, oh, boy, here we go.

40:02.720 --> 40:05.360
Justin, what I'm saying is I don't want a Bigger Burger

40:05.360 --> 40:08.240
because I like a smaller burger.

40:08.240 --> 40:09.280
I was specifically.

40:09.280 --> 40:14.800
I was specifically saying that making a Bigger Burger would be angry because I like a slider.

40:14.800 --> 40:15.440
Do you understand?

40:15.440 --> 40:16.000
Do you get it?

40:16.000 --> 40:17.520
Do you fucking get it?

40:17.520 --> 40:18.000
No, I get it.

40:18.000 --> 40:19.760
It's just not helpful.

40:19.760 --> 40:20.800
You're not helping.

40:20.800 --> 40:23.520
No, but I was going down an avenue, Justin.

40:23.520 --> 40:24.000
I was looking.

40:24.000 --> 40:24.720
I'll clean out my desk.

40:24.720 --> 40:25.440
I'll clean out my desk.

40:25.440 --> 40:25.760
Thank you.

40:25.760 --> 40:26.400
I'll clean up my desk.

40:26.400 --> 40:27.280
I'm tired of doing this.

40:27.280 --> 40:29.720
Oh, hey, hey, hey.

40:29.720 --> 40:30.720
You could eat the.

40:30.720 --> 40:31.200
You could eat the.

40:31.200 --> 40:33.040
You could squish the fine.

40:33.040 --> 40:34.160
How did you get in here, Griffin?

40:34.160 --> 40:34.960
The powerful ball.

40:34.960 --> 40:35.920
I closed the door.

40:35.920 --> 40:37.920
You heard me virtually close the door.

40:37.920 --> 40:41.280
Why are we creating so many audio escapes in this episode?

40:41.280 --> 40:44.000
It seems like we're leaning on audio escapes more than normal.

40:46.640 --> 40:52.800
Okay, speaking of nasty hamburger bites.

40:52.800 --> 40:53.520
I want a munch.

40:53.520 --> 40:54.020
Squad.

40:56.640 --> 40:58.080
I want to munch.

40:58.080 --> 40:58.580
Squad.

40:58.580 --> 41:08.180
My feeds are filled currently, not with menu innovations,

41:08.180 --> 41:10.020
which is a cornerstone of the Munch Squad,

41:11.060 --> 41:16.020
but just a lot of restaurants that are trying to do something.

41:16.020 --> 41:16.820
I mean, a lot of these.

41:16.820 --> 41:18.180
Can we live stream a taco?

41:19.060 --> 41:19.860
Is that anything?

41:21.220 --> 41:22.820
Bud, you're not that far off.

41:23.700 --> 41:26.500
Actually, Travis, you must be reading ahead.

41:26.500 --> 41:31.860
Rob Grogowski is going to join Chipotle for Thursday's virtual hangout.

41:33.060 --> 41:36.020
So everybody's kind of wondering what they can do, right?

41:36.020 --> 41:38.420
And there's a lot of brands that are just like,

41:38.420 --> 41:42.980
how do we Bojangles step in and try to do something about this?

41:43.620 --> 41:45.860
What is Bojangles' role in all of this?

41:46.900 --> 41:50.100
And I can safely do that because they closed the Bojangles in Huntington

41:50.100 --> 41:51.460
so nobody can get me.

41:51.460 --> 41:54.100
You can't do anything to hurt me, Bojangles.

41:54.100 --> 41:54.900
We will learn to.

41:54.900 --> 41:55.380
I'm invincible.

41:55.380 --> 41:58.900
We will learn to eat Bojangles and hold each other through the waves of the web.

42:01.220 --> 42:06.660
Rob Grogowski is going to join Chipotle for Thursday's virtual hangout.

42:06.660 --> 42:10.420
While people face ongoing challenges of spending time apart,

42:10.420 --> 42:15.300
Chipotle wants to connect with its fans and deliver some much needed positive vibes.

42:15.300 --> 42:20.740
Chipotle is teaming up with famous brand super fans to host Chipotle Together.

42:21.780 --> 42:23.380
Yes, they're both in caps.

42:23.380 --> 42:26.980
Chipotle Together, a series of virtual hangouts for fans

42:27.700 --> 42:32.020
that feature celebrity appearances, exclusive content and free entree giveaways.

42:32.580 --> 42:34.980
Folks, before I go too much deeper, I want to say,

42:36.580 --> 42:38.340
if someone says, what are you doing today?

42:39.060 --> 42:43.380
And you say, well, I'm going to hang out with Chipotle and Rob Grogowski virtually,

42:43.940 --> 42:47.460
that is very much a second month of quarantine answer.

42:47.460 --> 42:49.220
Like we will accept that and say,

42:49.220 --> 42:53.060
I think Chipotle thinks people are a lot more desperate right now

42:53.060 --> 42:54.500
than they are, baby.

42:54.500 --> 42:56.100
It's been like a week and a half.

42:56.100 --> 42:57.540
We're hanging in there.

42:57.540 --> 42:59.940
Like this is for spitball and new hobbies, right?

42:59.940 --> 43:02.180
Like you've just taken up knitting or painting.

43:02.180 --> 43:05.380
But by April, the knitting stuff's in the fucking garbage

43:05.380 --> 43:08.100
and you're fucking burritoing out with Gronk.

43:08.100 --> 43:08.740
Yes.

43:08.740 --> 43:09.940
Now, here's what I will say.

43:09.940 --> 43:13.300
If the pinch was we have overstuffed this burrito

43:13.300 --> 43:16.660
and you're going to watch Rob Grogowski try to navigate it.

43:17.540 --> 43:19.380
Yeah, that's maybe a third week.

43:19.380 --> 43:23.060
That might be a third week of the quarantine thing.

43:24.020 --> 43:26.900
Yeah, I feel like they've jumped the gun a little bit.

43:27.700 --> 43:31.380
Thursday's Chipotle Together, it's scheduled for 2 p.m.

43:31.380 --> 43:33.460
So you missed this one, but I'm sure there's going to be another.

43:34.260 --> 43:38.020
It's going to feature football legend, Rob Gronk Gronkowski

43:38.020 --> 43:42.260
and wrestler Mojo, who will host a 30 minute at home workout

43:42.260 --> 43:46.420
for fans on his Instagram, participate in a Q&A

43:46.420 --> 43:49.620
and give away 5,000 free burritos.

43:49.620 --> 43:52.740
Now, I'm going to assume it is a coupon

43:53.460 --> 43:56.820
and not some sort of elaborate,

43:56.820 --> 43:59.140
maybe drone based burrito delivery.

43:59.140 --> 44:00.500
Or pneumatic tubes.

44:00.500 --> 44:01.780
Or orbital cannon.

44:06.020 --> 44:06.580
Ow!

44:06.580 --> 44:09.540
Gronkowski has the nuclear football, which he loves.

44:10.100 --> 44:13.540
And he will use the orbital cannon to blast big, big burritos

44:13.540 --> 44:16.580
right down your chimney like a Santa Claus would.

44:16.580 --> 44:19.460
Chipotle has rolled out a series of innovations

44:19.460 --> 44:22.100
to elevate the delivery experience for its fans,

44:22.100 --> 44:24.260
which is a wild way of saying this.

44:25.860 --> 44:27.380
So they've got delivery kitchens,

44:27.380 --> 44:29.460
which featured dedicated teams and ingredient stations

44:29.460 --> 44:31.380
to prepare digital orders with care.

44:31.380 --> 44:32.100
Good.

44:32.100 --> 44:36.900
The second thing it says is new tamper evident packaging seals

44:36.900 --> 44:40.020
to help ensure food is untouched during delivery.

44:40.020 --> 44:41.220
Can we stop for a second?

44:41.220 --> 44:42.660
Can we stop for a second?

44:42.660 --> 44:44.420
Has this been...

44:44.420 --> 44:47.380
Hey Chipotle, can we talk over here?

44:48.260 --> 44:50.660
Has this been an ongoing concern

44:50.660 --> 44:52.900
that you're just now alerting me to?

44:54.020 --> 44:57.540
Have you been aware of a problem with food being untouched

44:57.540 --> 44:58.180
during delivery?

44:58.180 --> 45:01.380
You should have shared this information with the rest of us.

45:01.380 --> 45:02.260
Yes, right.

45:03.140 --> 45:04.740
Just so we're clear,

45:04.740 --> 45:08.260
I'm not loving that during the coronavirus pandemic.

45:08.260 --> 45:12.500
I'm also similarly not loving it before and or after.

45:12.500 --> 45:16.260
I really, if you had the one knowledge of this problem

45:16.260 --> 45:18.260
and two ability to stop it,

45:18.260 --> 45:19.940
it's morally delinquent

45:19.940 --> 45:23.140
that you have done nothing about it to this point.

45:23.140 --> 45:25.540
We have finally begun encouraging our employees

45:25.540 --> 45:28.100
to stop slapping the sour cream when they open it

45:28.100 --> 45:29.540
to test the surface tension.

45:30.900 --> 45:31.460
What?

45:31.460 --> 45:32.180
That's the thing,

45:32.180 --> 45:35.060
unless you can offer me a tamper proof thing

45:35.060 --> 45:36.420
that lets me know it wasn't touched

45:36.420 --> 45:38.260
while it was being made either,

45:38.260 --> 45:40.420
I think there is still an opportunity

45:40.420 --> 45:41.780
for contamination there.

45:41.780 --> 45:44.660
Because my concern wasn't that the person driving it

45:44.660 --> 45:45.220
would be like,

45:45.220 --> 45:47.380
I wanna see what they got on their burrito.

45:47.380 --> 45:49.140
Yeah, let me pop this open real quick

45:49.140 --> 45:50.820
and get a real quick touch going.

45:50.820 --> 45:52.500
I just wanna take stock of whether they got

45:52.500 --> 45:54.180
the pico de gallo or not.

45:54.180 --> 45:56.580
No, I don't think that's the concern.

45:56.580 --> 45:58.020
I want a tamper evident burrito

45:58.020 --> 45:59.060
where if you open it,

45:59.060 --> 46:00.980
it just fucking explodes and showers you

46:00.980 --> 46:04.820
in refried beans like a bait bag at a bank

46:04.820 --> 46:07.620
or something like that.

46:07.620 --> 46:08.820
This is our bait car,

46:08.820 --> 46:09.940
but it's a burrito.

46:09.940 --> 46:10.980
And if you even touch it,

46:10.980 --> 46:11.940
the cops will swarm.

46:12.900 --> 46:14.260
How about another question?

46:14.260 --> 46:15.300
How would that treat everybody?

46:15.300 --> 46:16.180
Yeah, that sounds good.

46:17.060 --> 46:18.100
Good, good, good.

46:18.100 --> 46:19.940
A duck has recently set up shop

46:19.940 --> 46:21.060
and laid eggs in the bush

46:21.060 --> 46:23.060
directly outside the only door to my apartment.

46:23.060 --> 46:23.380
Nice.

46:23.380 --> 46:25.380
The problem is every time I come home,

46:25.380 --> 46:26.900
the duck flaps away panicked

46:26.900 --> 46:28.820
and stands in the parking lot staring at me

46:28.820 --> 46:30.260
until I go inside.

46:30.260 --> 46:31.620
Aside from the near heart attack

46:31.620 --> 46:33.300
this caused me the first few times,

46:33.300 --> 46:35.700
I feel bad for repeatedly alarming this duck

46:35.700 --> 46:37.940
and interrupting her egg sitting routine.

46:37.940 --> 46:40.180
How do I convince this duck that we're chill

46:40.180 --> 46:42.100
and I want nothing but the best

46:42.100 --> 46:43.940
for her and her future ducklings?

46:43.940 --> 46:46.180
That's from Duck Disruptor in Tennessee,

46:46.180 --> 46:47.620
a very considerate human being.

46:47.620 --> 46:49.780
How do you know for the duck?

46:49.780 --> 46:51.780
Damn, I wish we could talk to ducks.

46:51.780 --> 46:52.180
Damn it.

46:52.180 --> 46:52.500
Right?

46:53.620 --> 46:55.300
Think of all the things we'd learn.

46:55.860 --> 46:57.460
Think of all the things we could teach them.

46:57.460 --> 46:57.940
Damn it.

46:59.620 --> 47:00.820
Our two societies,

47:00.820 --> 47:02.340
the duck and the human

47:02.340 --> 47:04.580
would improve by leaps and bounds

47:04.580 --> 47:06.500
if only we could break

47:06.500 --> 47:08.660
this damn communication barrier.

47:08.660 --> 47:10.180
I see a bunch of ducks hanging out at the park.

47:10.180 --> 47:11.140
I want to tell them like,

47:11.140 --> 47:12.260
guys, no, go home.

47:12.820 --> 47:14.660
You need to fucking chill right now, ducks.

47:14.660 --> 47:15.940
But they don't listen to me.

47:17.860 --> 47:19.940
I bet there's a lot of ducks out there

47:19.940 --> 47:20.740
that are like,

47:20.740 --> 47:22.340
man, I miss bread.

47:22.340 --> 47:22.900
Yeah.

47:22.900 --> 47:24.340
You guys remember?

47:24.340 --> 47:25.700
We didn't appreciate it

47:25.700 --> 47:26.660
when they would throw

47:26.660 --> 47:28.340
dumb goldfish crackers at us.

47:28.900 --> 47:29.780
I loved that.

47:29.780 --> 47:31.700
I should have told them when I had the chance

47:31.700 --> 47:33.860
and I could speak English this whole time.

47:33.860 --> 47:34.980
And I should have told them.

47:34.980 --> 47:36.980
What if the only word they know is quack?

47:36.980 --> 47:39.220
We just haven't taught them other words, right?

47:39.220 --> 47:40.180
Because they say quack.

47:40.180 --> 47:40.580
Whoa.

47:40.580 --> 47:42.420
And that's like a word in English, right?

47:42.420 --> 47:42.740
Quack.

47:43.620 --> 47:45.620
Well, there's a one duck that says Aflac.

47:45.620 --> 47:46.580
He is a goose,

47:46.580 --> 47:47.940
but they're the same animal as we've-

47:47.940 --> 47:48.740
No, he's a duck.

47:49.620 --> 47:49.940
Is he?

47:50.580 --> 47:50.820
Yeah.

47:52.180 --> 47:53.540
Yeah, he's a duck, isn't he?

47:53.540 --> 47:54.500
Yeah, read a book.

47:55.060 --> 47:55.460
Well-

47:55.460 --> 47:56.100
No way of knowing.

47:56.100 --> 47:56.980
Geese and duck.

47:56.980 --> 47:58.260
Justin, are you with me on this?

47:58.980 --> 48:00.580
They are the same animal.

48:00.580 --> 48:01.380
They're the same.

48:01.380 --> 48:02.660
One's a stretched out duck.

48:02.660 --> 48:04.020
If someone's taller,

48:04.020 --> 48:05.620
Benedict Cumberbatch is taller than me,

48:05.620 --> 48:08.900
I don't say there goes a human too.

48:08.900 --> 48:09.540
You know what I mean?

48:09.540 --> 48:11.140
Just because his body's a different shell.

48:11.140 --> 48:11.860
That's fucked up.

48:12.420 --> 48:14.980
There's no proof that he's human.

48:14.980 --> 48:18.100
But there is, what I'm saying, Griffin,

48:18.100 --> 48:20.260
is that you could maybe convince me

48:20.820 --> 48:22.500
Swan is big duck,

48:23.220 --> 48:24.900
but goose is not big duck.

48:24.900 --> 48:26.980
We can't relitigate this, Travis.

48:26.980 --> 48:30.660
I'm just saying Swan is like attractive big duck.

48:30.660 --> 48:31.860
It's the bridge.

48:31.860 --> 48:33.620
A goose is a whole other thing.

48:33.620 --> 48:36.580
It's the genetic bridge between these two incredible birds

48:36.580 --> 48:38.900
that no matter what, we can't talk to either of them.

48:38.900 --> 48:40.740
So there's no point arguing this.

48:40.740 --> 48:42.020
But what if we could find,

48:42.020 --> 48:43.780
we can talk to parrot, right?

48:43.780 --> 48:46.180
So if we find a parrot that can speak duck,

48:46.820 --> 48:48.180
that could be the in-between.

48:48.180 --> 48:48.740
Here we go.

48:49.220 --> 48:49.780
Here we go.

48:50.180 --> 48:50.820
Wait a minute.

48:51.780 --> 48:54.020
Travis, that's a big idea that we need to just

48:54.020 --> 48:55.380
slow down for a second.

48:55.380 --> 48:58.100
Slow down for a second.

48:58.100 --> 49:00.100
What Travis is suggesting is

49:01.540 --> 49:02.580
parrots speak a human.

49:03.940 --> 49:04.980
Parrots speak a bird.

49:06.340 --> 49:09.220
Is this the missing link that we've been needing?

49:09.220 --> 49:10.580
We just haven't asked.

49:10.580 --> 49:12.340
It's a really good point, actually.

49:12.340 --> 49:14.500
So I go to the park with my pet parrot

49:14.500 --> 49:17.700
and I say, parrot, you gotta warn these ducks.

49:18.260 --> 49:20.020
And then I hear the parrot, you know,

49:20.020 --> 49:21.780
make incredible bird noises

49:21.780 --> 49:24.420
that my stupid human ears can't even understand.

49:24.420 --> 49:26.580
And then I just kind of see one of the ducks eyebrows go up

49:26.580 --> 49:30.740
like, oh, oh, oh, and they scoot on home.

49:30.740 --> 49:31.300
Thanks for warning.

49:31.300 --> 49:33.380
They tell their friends all ducks are now

49:33.380 --> 49:35.620
like just fucking safe and in lockdown.

49:36.660 --> 49:37.780
Who's this parrot?

49:37.780 --> 49:39.540
Who is this Seabiscuit parrot?

49:39.540 --> 49:40.820
Is it just all parrots?

49:40.820 --> 49:43.060
Do we need to start like a network?

49:43.060 --> 49:44.980
Well, no, because I wouldn't, one,

49:44.980 --> 49:46.340
not all parents speak duck,

49:46.900 --> 49:48.500
but also like, do you trust?

49:49.220 --> 49:50.020
Like that's saying like,

49:50.020 --> 49:52.020
I would let anyone translate from me

49:52.020 --> 49:55.220
and like an important negotiation between two countries, right?

49:55.220 --> 49:56.260
We're gonna need to find

49:56.260 --> 49:58.660
like an even-tempered trustworthy parrot

49:58.660 --> 50:01.140
where like, I know that this parrot

50:01.140 --> 50:03.380
isn't taking liberties in the translation

50:03.940 --> 50:07.700
and isn't like, he told me to tell you he's cool,

50:07.700 --> 50:09.140
but he's a real turd.

50:09.860 --> 50:10.100
Yeah.

50:10.740 --> 50:11.380
You know?

50:11.380 --> 50:11.700
Yeah.

50:11.700 --> 50:13.220
How do you trust a parrot?

50:13.220 --> 50:14.740
There is no good answer for that,

50:14.740 --> 50:16.100
except for you don't, you can't.

50:16.100 --> 50:18.660
Well, you would have to find a duck who spoke human

50:18.660 --> 50:20.900
that the parrot didn't know that the duck spoke human

50:20.900 --> 50:23.060
that you could be like, all right, duck, what did he say?

50:23.060 --> 50:27.620
I mean, I've never asked a duck to honk into my phone

50:28.580 --> 50:30.020
using Google Translate.

50:30.020 --> 50:30.820
Oh, shit.

50:30.820 --> 50:32.180
Like I haven't tried it.

50:32.180 --> 50:34.180
And it probably, I'll be the first to say,

50:35.140 --> 50:37.140
99% chance it doesn't work.

50:37.140 --> 50:39.380
But if there's a 1% chance I can get out there

50:39.380 --> 50:39.940
But there's always that one chance.

50:39.940 --> 50:42.900
and just sort of ring the the the clacks on

50:42.900 --> 50:44.500
for these incredible animals,

50:45.540 --> 50:47.860
I'm going to, I am gonna risk it.

50:47.860 --> 50:50.180
Now, Griffin, if a scientist came to you and said,

50:50.180 --> 50:52.420
we figured it out, but we only have enough power

50:52.420 --> 50:54.820
to generate one message to the ducks.

50:55.620 --> 50:57.140
Get out, get out of there.

50:58.500 --> 51:01.540
Okay, but in what context?

51:01.540 --> 51:02.420
Get out of the bush?

51:04.020 --> 51:06.420
I mean, it's like, get out of there, wherever they're at.

51:06.420 --> 51:06.740
Yeah.

51:06.740 --> 51:07.860
Well, then where do they go?

51:07.860 --> 51:09.940
Are you just saying get off the planet, ducks?

51:09.940 --> 51:10.580
Okay, fine.

51:10.580 --> 51:11.860
Come to my house, ducks.

51:11.860 --> 51:12.820
You'll be safe here.

51:14.180 --> 51:16.260
But I don't feel like that is gonna like,

51:16.260 --> 51:20.740
you need to say like, trust me because, now come to my house.

51:20.740 --> 51:23.940
Trust me because I have some breath.

51:23.940 --> 51:26.100
Not a lot, but all ducks,

51:26.100 --> 51:28.340
please report to Griffin McElroy's house.

51:28.340 --> 51:31.060
This is mandatory.

51:31.060 --> 51:33.620
Or you know, let me finish.

51:33.620 --> 51:35.620
Okay, thank you.

51:35.620 --> 51:39.140
Dear all ducks, please report to Griffin McElroy's house,

51:39.140 --> 51:42.020
address here, and immediately.

51:42.020 --> 51:43.300
And I'm not even worried about like,

51:43.300 --> 51:44.180
putting that address out there

51:44.180 --> 51:46.660
because this will be in duck language.

51:46.660 --> 51:48.420
So like, human beings won't even understand it.

51:49.140 --> 51:50.100
And come to my house.

51:50.100 --> 51:50.820
I do have bread.

51:50.820 --> 51:51.860
This is mandatory.

51:51.860 --> 51:53.940
If you do not come to my house immediately,

51:53.940 --> 51:57.620
you will be punished with duck punishment.

51:57.620 --> 51:58.820
Ooh, that's the worst time.

51:58.820 --> 52:00.980
The ducks, and you're saying now,

52:00.980 --> 52:01.860
and this is a long message,

52:01.860 --> 52:03.060
but you didn't say how long it could be,

52:03.060 --> 52:04.820
but I haven't put a period in yet.

52:04.820 --> 52:06.900
And you may be wondering how Griffin knows

52:06.900 --> 52:08.100
what duck punishment is.

52:08.100 --> 52:10.180
Well, the ducks who do come to his house

52:10.180 --> 52:11.540
are going to tell him.

52:11.540 --> 52:13.380
And then he will turn that knowledge

52:13.380 --> 52:14.980
against the rest of you.

52:14.980 --> 52:17.540
So it's time to choose your side.

52:17.540 --> 52:19.460
The line has been drawn in the sand.

52:19.460 --> 52:21.540
Which, do you want to get through this thing

52:21.540 --> 52:23.700
and hang out with me and have a kick-ass duck party

52:23.700 --> 52:27.700
and eat some cool bread for like a day before I run out?

52:27.700 --> 52:29.700
Or are you going to do duck punishment?

52:29.700 --> 52:30.820
The choice is yours.

52:30.820 --> 52:31.540
Love, Griffin.

52:32.820 --> 52:34.500
And if that doesn't save these fucking,

52:35.060 --> 52:36.820
these beautiful, beautiful beasts,

52:37.940 --> 52:40.260
then they're not worth fucking saving, are they?

52:40.260 --> 52:42.740
Okay, well, it's all clear to me now

52:42.740 --> 52:44.820
is that you want the ducks to social distance

52:44.820 --> 52:45.780
away from humans.

52:47.140 --> 52:48.660
Or I've been social distancing,

52:48.660 --> 52:49.780
so it's cool if they come,

52:49.780 --> 52:51.700
if I'm understanding correctly,

52:51.700 --> 52:55.300
the doctors online and the ones that like come on the TV now

52:55.300 --> 52:57.220
and talk at me all the time,

52:57.220 --> 53:00.260
they did say, it's fine if you're isolating,

53:00.260 --> 53:02.740
go ahead and have a billion birds over to your house

53:02.740 --> 53:04.020
and you should be okay.

53:04.900 --> 53:06.980
Well, that'll be good because up till now

53:07.540 --> 53:11.300
ducks have been so aggressively social with human beings.

53:11.300 --> 53:13.060
They have no idea that they're not supposed to like

53:13.060 --> 53:14.340
go to the movies or anything.

53:15.140 --> 53:17.060
A little too friendly if you ask me.

53:18.100 --> 53:19.940
So I think that answers the question, right?

53:20.900 --> 53:23.300
I mean, it's pretty well fucking answered, Travis.

53:23.300 --> 53:25.460
Thank you so much for listening to our podcast,

53:25.460 --> 53:26.580

We hope that you are staying sane and hopeful and home

53:31.140 --> 53:36.100
and still managing to keep your spirits up

53:36.100 --> 53:37.380
during these challenging times.

53:37.380 --> 53:40.900
We're glad that you've chosen this entertainment product

53:40.900 --> 53:42.980
as your constant companion.

53:43.940 --> 53:45.300
We're so happy to be here with you.

53:47.380 --> 53:49.380
Normally we'd plug something here.

53:50.260 --> 53:51.060
But we won't.

53:52.420 --> 53:54.340
I'll plug John Roderick and the Long Winters

53:54.340 --> 53:57.220
who let us use their theme song, our theme song,

53:57.220 --> 53:59.140
it's a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

53:59.700 --> 54:01.780
So yeah, go get that now.

54:01.780 --> 54:04.100
I mean, get it digital, get it digital today.

54:04.820 --> 54:06.340
Get it digital today.

54:06.340 --> 54:07.540
In months and months from now,

54:07.540 --> 54:09.860
when I'm sure everything will be back to normal and fine,

54:09.860 --> 54:11.620
The Adventure Zone graphic novel book three

54:11.620 --> 54:12.740
is gonna come out.

54:12.740 --> 54:13.940
Yeah, that's a good one.

54:13.940 --> 54:14.500
That's a good one.

54:14.500 --> 54:16.820
You can pre-order that at theadventurezonecomic.com.

54:17.380 --> 54:18.820
Just take care of each other.

54:18.820 --> 54:20.660
You know, wash your hands, take care of each other.

54:20.660 --> 54:23.140
2 p.m. Thursdays, tune in for Gronk's burrito hour.

54:24.180 --> 54:25.460
Yeah, I'll be there.

54:25.460 --> 54:28.180
And it starts in 23 minutes as we're recording this.

54:28.180 --> 54:30.020
I gotta wrap it up.

54:30.020 --> 54:31.940
I gotta get my tuxedo on.

54:32.500 --> 54:33.780
Oh, and real quick.

54:33.780 --> 54:37.060
So we're doing our first ever live streaming

54:37.060 --> 54:39.140
Cincinnati Underground Society show.

54:39.140 --> 54:41.620
Usually only people in the Cincinnati area can come,

54:41.620 --> 54:43.220
but now anyone can watch.

54:43.860 --> 54:47.140
It's going to be this Friday, the 3rd, April 3rd,

54:47.700 --> 54:49.460
8 to 11 p.m. Eastern time.

54:50.420 --> 54:53.140
And we have a huge lineup of guests.

54:53.140 --> 54:54.420
It's like 10 or more people,

54:54.420 --> 54:57.060
including some people who you might recognize

54:57.860 --> 54:59.060
from some McElroy shows.

54:59.940 --> 55:00.500
Hint, hint.

55:00.500 --> 55:03.140
It's a surprise lineup, but I promise you,

55:03.140 --> 55:05.220
they are all incredible.

55:05.220 --> 55:08.420
Tickets start at $5, but proceeds go to charity.

55:08.420 --> 55:12.420
We have chosen a charity that provides equipment

55:12.420 --> 55:14.900
and supplies for healthcare workers

55:14.900 --> 55:16.340
responding to COVID-19.

55:17.220 --> 55:19.300
So it's a great cause,

55:19.300 --> 55:20.740
and it's going to be a super fun show.

55:21.380 --> 55:24.900
You can get your tickets at bit.ly slash cuslive.

55:24.900 --> 55:29.220
That's bit.ly slash c-u-s-s-l-i-v-e.

55:30.100 --> 55:33.700
This Friday, 8 to 11 p.m. Eastern time.

55:33.700 --> 55:34.660
Be there.

55:34.660 --> 55:35.860
It's going to be super fun.

55:36.500 --> 55:37.700
Thank you so much for listening.

55:37.700 --> 55:40.340
Griffin, do you have a final Yahoo for us?

55:40.340 --> 55:41.620
I don't know who sent it in, though,

55:41.620 --> 55:43.940
because that part got deleted,

55:43.940 --> 55:45.940
and we're holding this thing together with twine and tape,

55:45.940 --> 55:47.060
but I apologize.

55:47.780 --> 55:51.060
It's asked by Yahoo Answers user yeet, who asks,

55:53.300 --> 55:56.100
how does one spoon an angel?

55:58.980 --> 56:00.340
My name is Justin McElroy.

56:00.340 --> 56:02.020
I'm Travis McElroy.

56:02.020 --> 56:03.540
I'm Griffin McElroy.

56:03.540 --> 56:04.900
This has been My Brother, My Brother and Me.

56:04.900 --> 56:05.860
Kiss your dad.

56:05.860 --> 56:07.860
Square on the lips.
