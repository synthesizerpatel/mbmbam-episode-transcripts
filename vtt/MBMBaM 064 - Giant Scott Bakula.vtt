WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:48.000
Live from the floor of Comic-Con, it's my brother, my brother, and me,

00:48.000 --> 00:50.720
an advice show for the modern era. I'm Marmaduke.

00:54.160 --> 00:56.160
I'm Naruto. Is that a thing?

00:56.160 --> 00:59.120
Yeah, you're Naruto. I'm Marmaduke. Travis, who are you cosplaying as?

00:59.120 --> 01:00.640
Beetle Bailey.

01:00.640 --> 01:03.200
Oh man, Travis won it.

01:03.200 --> 01:06.800
Sarge is back on the case. He's going after Trav again.

01:06.800 --> 01:11.120
Travis has actually matched up Beetle Bailey and Big Bad Beetleborgs,

01:11.840 --> 01:17.360
which everyone knows what we're all about. It's basically Beetle Bailey in a robot bug suit.

01:17.360 --> 01:18.800
It's Big Bad Beetle Bailey.

01:19.840 --> 01:23.680
If this is supposed to be a comic convention, there should be way more stink lines floating

01:23.680 --> 01:28.160
around this place. That's all I can think is like, if this were a comic book, you wouldn't

01:28.160 --> 01:31.360
even be able to see the signs. You wouldn't be able to navigate the floor.

01:31.360 --> 01:33.760
You're talking about like pig pen-esque stink lines.

01:33.760 --> 01:34.880
Pig pen stink lines.

01:34.880 --> 01:35.760
PU flies.

01:37.600 --> 01:41.440
I think there should be more PU flies. I think if you wanted to cosplay as something,

01:41.440 --> 01:44.640
you should just have visible stink lines emanating from your body.

01:44.640 --> 01:47.200
Because come on, man. Look at yourself.

01:48.480 --> 01:50.960
That's a slippery slope though, because if I ever went to Comic-Con,

01:50.960 --> 01:54.880
I would just walk around and be like, oh, you're PU lines. Oh, you're stink lines.

01:54.880 --> 02:00.080
Oh, no. You just kind of have. That's just the stink of the con.

02:00.080 --> 02:06.800
We're not actually there, but through the magic of audio and imagination, we can be there.

02:07.680 --> 02:12.240
I'm really happy to see all of the Kevin James cosplayers this year.

02:14.960 --> 02:18.720
I bet Kevin James is there. I bet he's dressed up like the fattest Doctor Who.

02:19.520 --> 02:22.960
Yeah, it shouldn't be tough to find a fat guy at Comic-Con.

02:22.960 --> 02:25.440
Let's just all keep an eye peeled for him.

02:25.440 --> 02:28.240
Doctor Who took my lasagna starring Kevin James.

02:33.200 --> 02:35.360
Doctor Who moved my beef butter sandwich.

02:36.960 --> 02:38.240
I'm starving.

02:39.120 --> 02:42.240
Doctor Who could ever love a man that can't put their arms around.

02:45.280 --> 02:49.040
That's a pretty good cosplay. Comic-Con cosplayer.

02:49.040 --> 02:53.200
Um, so this is obviously an advice show for the modern era.

02:53.200 --> 02:55.680
I am your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

02:55.680 --> 02:57.840
I am your middle brother, Travis McElroy.

02:57.840 --> 02:59.840
I'm your youngest brother, Griffin McElroy.

02:59.840 --> 03:02.720
Griffin, who's transported coming to you for the first time

03:03.600 --> 03:05.120
in beautiful Austin Tech House.

03:05.840 --> 03:09.840
Such a lovely city. So lovely. So arid. I love how arid it is.

03:10.480 --> 03:11.600
Is everything Adobe?

03:12.480 --> 03:17.760
Everything is Adobe Photoshop and Premiere and Sound Booth.

03:17.760 --> 03:19.200
So. That sounds nice.

03:19.200 --> 03:21.440
It's a little software joke for everybody.

03:22.000 --> 03:22.880
Hope you enjoyed it.

03:24.480 --> 03:27.200
You can expect much more of that in the hour to come.

03:27.200 --> 03:29.200
Griffin, you said it was arid.

03:29.200 --> 03:31.120
So with your blonde hair and blue eyes,

03:31.120 --> 03:32.480
you must be fitting in really well.

03:33.120 --> 03:34.880
That's not what that word means.

03:34.880 --> 03:35.760
But it's close.

03:35.760 --> 03:37.520
You kept saying, I really want to move there.

03:37.520 --> 03:39.760
It's arid. And then you would wink.

03:39.760 --> 03:40.720
And I wouldn't understand.

03:40.720 --> 03:42.880
But now I think I finally get it.

03:42.880 --> 03:45.040
So you might call it the master state

03:45.040 --> 03:46.080
and I would wink again.

03:46.080 --> 03:49.040
And you'd be like, well, now you're just, everyone knows.

03:49.040 --> 03:50.640
I'm not even being clever anymore.

03:50.640 --> 03:52.240
Hey, let's get into some advice.

03:52.240 --> 03:54.400
I've got the best group of friends.

03:54.400 --> 03:56.000
Problem is, they're all guys.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.680
Did I mention I'm a girl?

03:57.680 --> 03:59.360
You didn't. You know you didn't.

03:59.360 --> 04:01.280
You just wrote that as two sentences in.

04:01.280 --> 04:01.600
You know you didn't include that.

04:01.600 --> 04:03.440
Two sentences deep. You didn't know.

04:03.440 --> 04:05.040
Of course you wrote you're a girl.

04:05.040 --> 04:05.840
It said right there.

04:07.280 --> 04:08.880
And you knew that going in.

04:08.880 --> 04:10.320
And this question is a trick.

04:10.320 --> 04:11.440
I'm not sure I want to read.

04:11.440 --> 04:13.840
Like, what other surprises does she have in store?

04:13.840 --> 04:15.120
But here's the twist.

04:15.120 --> 04:16.560
I'm a girl. Follow me.

04:16.560 --> 04:17.120
Follow me.

04:17.120 --> 04:18.880
I feel like she's wilding out.

04:18.880 --> 04:20.640
Oh, you think it's a punk situation

04:20.640 --> 04:22.400
where the rabbit hole just keeps getting deeper.

04:22.400 --> 04:22.960
Well, let's see.

04:23.520 --> 04:25.680
I've always gotten along better with the opposite gender,

04:25.680 --> 04:28.160
but I'm getting sick of all the testosterone.

04:28.160 --> 04:30.080
I really need some female friends in my life,

04:30.080 --> 04:31.600
but don't know where to start.

04:31.600 --> 04:33.520
What's the best way to make some girlfriends

04:33.520 --> 04:35.600
without appearing desperate?

04:35.600 --> 04:38.800
That's from tired of the sausage fest.

04:38.800 --> 04:41.680
Who are, who do you, who the fuck do you think we are?

04:42.400 --> 04:43.200
Yeah.

04:43.200 --> 04:45.760
Yeah, who, why do you think that we have any,

04:46.560 --> 04:49.440
any wisdom to impart to you in this particular situation?

04:49.440 --> 04:51.760
You could like braid each other's hair,

04:51.760 --> 04:53.040
get manicures.

04:53.040 --> 04:56.000
But you got to find, you got to find someone to braid first.

04:56.000 --> 04:56.880
You can't just walk up.

04:56.880 --> 04:58.480
No, you can just do a drive by.

04:58.480 --> 05:00.080
You can do a drive by braiding.

05:00.080 --> 05:01.040
Let me see those locks.

05:01.600 --> 05:02.960
We're going to be real good friends.

05:03.760 --> 05:04.960
We're going to get real close.

05:04.960 --> 05:06.160
Let's go get our nails done.

05:07.920 --> 05:09.760
Getting your nails did is good.

05:09.760 --> 05:11.440
Because you can just open a nail salon

05:11.440 --> 05:14.080
and then befriend your, your agents.

05:14.080 --> 05:16.080
Ooh, that, that could be a really,

05:16.080 --> 05:17.280
that could work out really well.

05:17.280 --> 05:19.840
But that's, you don't have to open up a small business

05:19.840 --> 05:20.560
to make friends.

05:21.120 --> 05:22.080
Well, that's true.

05:22.080 --> 05:23.520
That's quite an investment on,

05:23.520 --> 05:24.960
on something that may not pan out.

05:27.120 --> 05:29.360
Maybe, hmm.

05:29.360 --> 05:33.280
Go to the gym, join like a spinning class or something.

05:33.280 --> 05:36.240
The problem is like, you're, I don't know how,

05:36.240 --> 05:38.320
if you, if I knew how to meet girls.

05:38.880 --> 05:39.360
Yeah.

05:39.360 --> 05:42.000
Like, man, if you can crack that particular case,

05:42.000 --> 05:43.360
then, then we'd have something.

05:43.360 --> 05:46.400
But I, I, how does anybody meet a girl?

05:46.400 --> 05:47.120
I don't know.

05:47.760 --> 05:49.520
I don't remember how I met my wife.

05:49.520 --> 05:50.880
I just knew her.

05:51.600 --> 05:53.200
And then we were wed.

05:53.200 --> 05:55.120
I believe I've always known her.

05:55.120 --> 05:55.520
Yeah.

05:55.520 --> 05:56.720
She just was.

05:56.720 --> 05:57.840
She just was.

05:57.840 --> 05:59.120
And then I married her.

05:59.120 --> 06:01.680
But I do not remember, I don't think we actually met.

06:01.680 --> 06:03.040
I don't think I've ever met a girl.

06:03.840 --> 06:05.120
Now that I think about it,

06:05.120 --> 06:06.400
I don't think I've ever met one.

06:06.400 --> 06:10.480
But I would say that I think that making new friends,

06:10.480 --> 06:11.520
no matter what gender,

06:12.480 --> 06:15.120
kind of follow the same rule of thumb

06:15.120 --> 06:18.000
as trying to find like a boyfriend or girlfriend,

06:18.000 --> 06:19.360
a romantic relationship,

06:19.360 --> 06:21.760
which is if you go out looking for it,

06:21.760 --> 06:23.440
you're going to scare all of them away.

06:24.160 --> 06:27.600
You know, if you roll up and you start a conversation

06:27.600 --> 06:30.960
with a girl at, you know, Starbucks or something,

06:30.960 --> 06:32.560
and you're like, so can we like hang out

06:32.560 --> 06:34.080
and be best friends and stuff?

06:34.080 --> 06:36.720
She is not going to want to hang out with you ever again

06:36.720 --> 06:37.680
because you are scary.

06:38.400 --> 06:41.840
I don't think this listener would do that,

06:41.840 --> 06:42.960
Travis, what you just said.

06:42.960 --> 06:43.360
I don't think-

06:43.360 --> 06:44.080
Well, she asked, you know,

06:44.080 --> 06:45.520
how to do it without appearing desperate.

06:45.520 --> 06:47.600
And I think, you know, you build slowly

06:47.600 --> 06:50.160
the same way you do any relationship.

06:50.160 --> 06:52.080
You know, you hang out a couple of times,

06:52.080 --> 06:54.640
you make plans, anything like that.

06:54.640 --> 06:57.840
Just, you know, if you meet someone and they seem fun,

06:57.840 --> 07:00.480
and, you know, you would like to hang out with them more,

07:01.040 --> 07:01.920
just ask them.

07:01.920 --> 07:04.000
I feel like you should just embrace the situation

07:04.000 --> 07:04.560
you have now.

07:04.560 --> 07:06.480
I feel like you could have a real

07:06.480 --> 07:08.240
queen of the Nile situation on your hands

07:08.240 --> 07:09.680
if you play your cards right.

07:09.680 --> 07:10.640
Oh, really?

07:10.640 --> 07:13.120
Sort of like a weighted on hand and foot

07:13.840 --> 07:15.440
queen of the voice type situation?

07:15.440 --> 07:16.880
Carried around town on a palanquin.

07:16.880 --> 07:18.320
Like, I think this could all,

07:18.320 --> 07:20.560
I think this would all be really, really good.

07:20.560 --> 07:22.800
Don't any of these guys have girlfriends

07:22.800 --> 07:23.920
or sisters or anything?

07:23.920 --> 07:25.600
Oh, that's a good connection.

07:25.600 --> 07:25.920
Yeah.

07:25.920 --> 07:26.480
Or moms.

07:27.520 --> 07:28.240
Or moms?

07:28.240 --> 07:29.760
Moms are great friends.

07:29.760 --> 07:32.640
With their, they've got a lot of good stories.

07:33.680 --> 07:34.800
They have those jeans.

07:36.000 --> 07:36.560
Sure.

07:36.560 --> 07:37.600
That look like that?

07:37.600 --> 07:38.320
This sucks.

07:38.320 --> 07:40.480
We don't have, like, I don't know any girls.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.760
I'm almost certain that they don't exist.

07:44.720 --> 07:46.000
This is one of those things, though,

07:46.000 --> 07:47.360
where we get that question all the time.

07:47.360 --> 07:48.400
How do I make friends?

07:48.400 --> 07:48.800
I don't know.

07:48.800 --> 07:49.840
What's your skill set?

07:49.840 --> 07:51.200
Like, what, you know?

07:51.200 --> 07:52.480
I need to know something about you.

07:52.480 --> 07:53.760
What are you bringing to the table?

07:53.760 --> 07:54.000
Yeah.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.120
What, are you funny?

07:55.120 --> 07:58.000
Or maybe you're really smart or you're rich.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.640
What are your strengths that are going to draw people into you?

08:01.440 --> 08:02.640
Because there's only three,

08:02.640 --> 08:04.400
and they're funny, smart, or rich.

08:04.400 --> 08:05.440
So which are you?

08:05.440 --> 08:06.000
Which, which skills are you?

08:06.000 --> 08:07.680
Or super attractive.

08:07.680 --> 08:08.080
Four.

08:08.080 --> 08:10.000
Super attractive is the other one.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.960
Maybe you have this army of guys that follows you around

08:12.960 --> 08:14.320
that can lift heavy things for them

08:14.320 --> 08:15.520
and help them move and stuff.

08:16.400 --> 08:17.840
Why don't you send those guys out?

08:18.560 --> 08:21.760
Like, like, like birds of prey

08:21.760 --> 08:23.520
and say, go bring me some women.

08:24.320 --> 08:26.080
Fetch me women, men.

08:26.080 --> 08:29.360
I think we've, I think we've probably constructed

08:29.360 --> 08:32.960
a far different relationship between her and her male friends.

08:33.760 --> 08:35.680
It's kind of a hive mind thing here.

08:35.680 --> 08:36.400
Yeah, right.

08:36.400 --> 08:38.400
We've established her as quite the queen bee.

08:38.400 --> 08:40.480
I'm not sure it rolls out just like that.

08:40.480 --> 08:43.760
But I think that, I think asking them,

08:43.760 --> 08:45.600
like, like trying to hang out with,

08:45.600 --> 08:48.160
like if they got a sister or a mom or something,

08:48.160 --> 08:49.920
I think that that's actually a pretty good,

08:50.960 --> 08:51.840
a pretty good play.

08:51.840 --> 08:54.240
You know, meeting people through people is always easier

08:54.240 --> 08:56.800
than making that initial connection.

08:56.800 --> 08:58.400
Everybody has a hip aunt.

08:58.400 --> 09:00.560
Everybody's got a cool aunt, Julie.

09:00.560 --> 09:03.680
A lot of my friends and also my brother

09:03.680 --> 09:06.080
are trying to tell me to live with my fiance

09:06.080 --> 09:07.600
before we are married.

09:07.600 --> 09:09.520
I don't like that idea because I'm trying to follow

09:09.520 --> 09:11.360
the biblical teaching on the situation.

09:11.360 --> 09:13.680
And I've told them this on many occasions.

09:13.680 --> 09:14.800
Could you please help me with this?

09:15.440 --> 09:15.840
Yeah.

09:15.840 --> 09:18.560
Well, Mike, for people trying to live a biblical lifestyle,

09:18.560 --> 09:20.720
you have certainly come to the right program.

09:20.720 --> 09:26.880
But let me walk you through what my Bible says.

09:26.880 --> 09:31.280
Of course, my Bible is the gift book,

09:31.280 --> 09:33.920
the bro code based on the hit television show

09:34.560 --> 09:35.680
How I Met Your Mother.

09:35.680 --> 09:38.320
This is supposedly written by Barney Stinson,

09:38.320 --> 09:40.880
but I'm pretty sure they had a workshop of ghost writers.

09:40.880 --> 09:42.960
That's my Bible.

09:42.960 --> 09:46.720
And my Bible says, just go for it, bro.

09:46.720 --> 09:47.360
Really?

09:47.360 --> 09:51.440
Yeah, that's what it says in my Bible.

09:51.440 --> 09:52.400
Just live with her.

09:52.400 --> 09:55.760
And then they've got like a picture of Barney

09:55.760 --> 09:58.560
from How I Met Your Mother, and he's just sort of sitting.

09:59.280 --> 10:01.200
He's kind of winking at the camera,

10:01.200 --> 10:02.960
but you kind of know what he's saying.

10:02.960 --> 10:04.560
Is he wearing a suit, perchance?

10:05.120 --> 10:11.600
Yeah, he has suited up, I think, is how you would say it.

10:11.600 --> 10:13.120
It's a great gift book.

10:13.120 --> 10:18.480
It's available for $14.99 at your local, well, not Borders, but-

10:18.480 --> 10:19.360
Spencer's.

10:19.360 --> 10:20.560
Spencer's gifts.

10:20.560 --> 10:22.880
Spencer's is filling the Borders void now.

10:22.880 --> 10:28.320
They're just selling literature and blow up fuck dolls.

10:30.320 --> 10:34.320
I don't think that Spencer's sells blow up fuck dolls.

10:34.320 --> 10:35.120
Oh yeah, they do.

10:35.120 --> 10:36.320
They do, but as a goose.

10:38.560 --> 10:40.400
They're not like sexy blow up fuck dolls.

10:40.400 --> 10:43.600
They're like Queen Elizabeth.

10:43.600 --> 10:44.080
Get it?

10:44.080 --> 10:44.640
I'm with you.

10:45.840 --> 10:51.360
Hey, Mike, I would tell them that they need to back off

10:52.800 --> 10:54.320
and you're going to do your thing,

10:54.320 --> 10:55.680
and they're going to do their thing,

10:55.680 --> 10:58.160
and then later where they're in hell burning forever,

10:58.800 --> 11:01.680
they can get back with you on whether or not you made the right decision.

11:01.680 --> 11:03.760
But for right now, no dice.

11:03.760 --> 11:04.560
Quick counterpoint.

11:04.560 --> 11:09.520
I don't think it's a terrible, awful idea to live with your fiance before marriage,

11:09.520 --> 11:11.120
but if you don't want to, like-

11:11.920 --> 11:12.720
Sure, right.

11:12.720 --> 11:15.840
If you're asking for what I think you should do,

11:15.840 --> 11:19.920
what I think you should do is live with somebody before you marry them,

11:19.920 --> 11:26.480
but I think that what you don't need right now is more people telling you

11:26.480 --> 11:28.080
what to do in your life.

11:28.080 --> 11:29.680
You don't need an advice show.

11:29.680 --> 11:34.240
You need a show called Back Off Mike, where just guys tell people-

11:34.240 --> 11:35.760
Step out my grill.

11:35.760 --> 11:37.120
Get out Mike's grill.

11:37.120 --> 11:38.080
Starring nobody.

11:38.080 --> 11:39.200
Yeah, yeah.

11:39.200 --> 11:41.600
Everything and every major decision in your life,

11:42.240 --> 11:47.040
there will be just countless people that think they know it better than you

11:47.040 --> 11:48.400
because they've done it before,

11:48.400 --> 11:49.680
or they've seen it in movies,

11:49.680 --> 11:51.120
or they've read it in magazines.

11:52.000 --> 11:55.360
Tell them just to back the fuck off because it's your situation.

11:56.640 --> 11:58.080
Advice is always welcome,

11:58.080 --> 12:00.640
but at the end of the day, it's your decision, not theirs.

12:00.640 --> 12:01.920
At the end of the day, step off.

12:03.520 --> 12:05.760
I'm going to interject here and just say that

12:05.760 --> 12:10.800
ignore everything that Justin and Travis are saying because you gots to live with them.

12:11.440 --> 12:12.640
Oh, you totally do,

12:12.640 --> 12:14.800
but you just don't need to listen to your friends and brother.

12:14.800 --> 12:15.680
Listen to us.

12:15.680 --> 12:20.560
You gots to listen to us because you gots to live with her.

12:20.560 --> 12:25.040
Oh man, because she does some shit that you don't know about yet

12:25.040 --> 12:27.280
that you need to know about before you get betrothed.

12:28.880 --> 12:30.480
What if she poops in the shower?

12:30.480 --> 12:34.480
That's not something you're going to get until you share a residence with her.

12:34.480 --> 12:36.160
Mike, can I throw this out?

12:36.720 --> 12:38.080
Two-bedroom apartment.

12:38.080 --> 12:40.000
You're thinking that'll keep it holy.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
Yeah, I'm saying he can live with her

12:42.000 --> 12:46.400
without necessarily caving in on the biblical teachings.

12:46.400 --> 12:47.520
Hey, Travis.

12:48.160 --> 12:48.800
Hey, Travis.

12:51.280 --> 12:54.160
Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior, is not an RA.

12:55.760 --> 12:58.800
We're not trying to fucking thwart the dean here, okay?

12:58.800 --> 13:00.160
Like, it's Jesus.

13:00.160 --> 13:01.520
He knows what's up.

13:01.520 --> 13:04.720
He's not fucking fooled by your chicanery.

13:04.720 --> 13:06.080
He knows the score.

13:06.080 --> 13:07.200
Like, he's not like,

13:07.200 --> 13:09.440
oh, looks like two different apartments from way up here.

13:12.960 --> 13:15.600
Where I sit, this seems pretty kosher.

13:15.600 --> 13:18.320
You got to get a three-bedroom apartment, right?

13:18.320 --> 13:21.840
And then you guys sleep on the outer perimeter bedrooms

13:21.840 --> 13:24.400
and the middle bedroom, that's where the Holy Spirit sleeps.

13:25.280 --> 13:27.280
I'll leave a little space there.

13:27.280 --> 13:28.720
He'll appreciate the gesture,

13:28.720 --> 13:32.000
even though he will continue to help forever.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.360
My body is ready for Yahoo.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.400
Let me see if I can help you with that.

13:36.400 --> 13:38.880
Oh, this one was sent in by Gabriel Pinto.

13:39.680 --> 13:40.400
Okay.

13:40.400 --> 13:42.800
Usually these questions are just like super bad ideas,

13:42.800 --> 13:44.000
but this one is actually like,

13:45.040 --> 13:46.640
this one's actually a really good solution

13:46.640 --> 13:47.600
to an important problem.

13:47.600 --> 13:53.440
It was asked by, ah, fuck, ASDFVBSD,

13:53.440 --> 13:56.000
which makes me think that he took his name selection

13:56.000 --> 13:56.800
pretty seriously.

13:56.800 --> 14:02.000
And he asked, why don't they STD test everyone all at once?

14:02.720 --> 14:03.120
Okay.

14:03.680 --> 14:05.760
Like to kill off all of the treatable stuff

14:05.760 --> 14:07.840
and alert people with non-curable ones

14:07.840 --> 14:10.160
so they can not spread it and also treat it.

14:10.160 --> 14:13.440
Because like now there is super gonorrhea

14:13.440 --> 14:14.800
that isn't curable yet.

14:14.800 --> 14:17.680
And this is going to happen with every curable STD eventually.

14:19.040 --> 14:20.240
So he wants-

14:20.240 --> 14:23.280
He's saying like just massive people round up.

14:23.280 --> 14:24.640
He's talking, he's saying,

14:24.640 --> 14:29.120
hey, everyone on the earth, it's chlamydia day.

14:29.840 --> 14:30.160
Okay.

14:30.160 --> 14:32.560
And everyone goes to the doctor

14:32.560 --> 14:34.000
and they get their chlamydia cured.

14:34.000 --> 14:37.120
And then guess what guys, chlamydia is gone.

14:38.080 --> 14:40.000
So, okay, wait, hold on.

14:40.560 --> 14:43.520
So on one day, everyone in the world-

14:43.520 --> 14:44.320
Chlamydia day.

14:44.320 --> 14:44.880
Chlamydia day.

14:44.880 --> 14:45.600
Yeah, thank you.

14:46.080 --> 14:48.240
Everyone in the world-

14:48.240 --> 14:48.800
On the planet.

14:48.800 --> 14:50.560
Will simultaneously go to the hospital.

14:50.560 --> 14:51.200
Yes, yes.

14:51.200 --> 14:52.320
This is the concept.

14:52.320 --> 14:53.360
And they would have-

14:53.360 --> 14:58.640
So the world grinds to a halt so we can get rid of chlamydia.

14:58.640 --> 15:02.560
It'll be like the rapture, but for wiener disease.

15:02.560 --> 15:03.520
Is that what you're saying?

15:03.520 --> 15:05.680
We got three and a half billion dicks.

15:05.680 --> 15:08.160
We got three and a half billion vaginas.

15:08.160 --> 15:11.760
Let's just get them all peeped at the same moment in time.

15:12.480 --> 15:14.320
And then where did all of our diseases go?

15:15.840 --> 15:17.600
I don't know where my chlamydia went.

15:17.600 --> 15:20.000
And by my chlamydia, I mean the earth's chlamydia.

15:20.000 --> 15:20.480
It's gone.

15:20.480 --> 15:23.440
Okay, but real quick, just brain teaser here.

15:23.440 --> 15:23.840
Okay.

15:23.840 --> 15:25.040
Who checks the checkers?

15:27.600 --> 15:28.400
They check each other?

15:28.960 --> 15:30.000
They check each other.

15:30.000 --> 15:30.720
What are you-

15:30.720 --> 15:34.960
I think here's the one of the infrastructure issues you're gonna run into here.

15:34.960 --> 15:35.200
Okay.

15:35.200 --> 15:38.960
Is that you're gonna have a lot of beautiful people getting treated for chlamydia all at once.

15:39.520 --> 15:42.480
And there's gonna be a line of other people waiting.

15:42.480 --> 15:43.120
No.

15:43.120 --> 15:44.400
Yeah, they're gonna re-hook up.

15:45.040 --> 15:48.480
They're gonna go to the coat check room at the hospital.

15:48.480 --> 15:50.000
At the hospital, the coat check room.

15:50.000 --> 15:50.880
The coat check room.

15:50.880 --> 15:51.680
The champagne room.

15:51.680 --> 15:53.760
The lab coat check room.

15:55.520 --> 15:58.960
And they're gonna hook up.

15:58.960 --> 16:01.600
Hey, quick side note, not to derail us too much.

16:02.400 --> 16:05.760
Did you know that doctors sometimes prescribe beer?

16:06.880 --> 16:07.200
No.

16:07.200 --> 16:09.440
They have prescription beer at the hospital.

16:09.440 --> 16:10.160
Like if you're an alcoholic-

16:10.160 --> 16:11.360
No, you're fucking with me.

16:11.360 --> 16:18.400
They don't want you to have the DTs there while you're getting treated for something else.

16:18.400 --> 16:20.320
So they have prescription beer.

16:20.320 --> 16:22.560
Is it MGD-64?

16:22.560 --> 16:24.160
They will like prescribe you a cold one.

16:24.160 --> 16:25.040
Oh, it's gotta be the war.

16:25.040 --> 16:26.400
It's gotta be like Schlitz.

16:26.400 --> 16:29.120
Like he needs 30 seasons of Schlitz.

16:29.120 --> 16:30.240
Shasta beer.

16:31.120 --> 16:33.280
This is Faygo beer.

16:33.280 --> 16:34.000
Like beer.

16:35.600 --> 16:36.080
But yeah.

16:37.040 --> 16:41.120
That's only gonna help fuel the chlamydia day fuck party.

16:41.120 --> 16:42.000
Oh, shit.

16:42.000 --> 16:42.160
Right.

16:42.160 --> 16:45.920
They're gonna open all the prescription beers and they're gonna get crazy.

16:45.920 --> 16:53.280
So what we've established here is that by trying to cure chlamydia, we create a perfect storm.

16:53.280 --> 16:59.200
Ground zero of a white squall of peepee diseases.

16:59.200 --> 16:59.520
Yeah.

16:59.520 --> 17:00.000
Uh-huh.

17:00.800 --> 17:05.280
To the point where it becomes corporeal and takes human form.

17:05.280 --> 17:06.640
Oh, gross.

17:06.640 --> 17:07.360
Like Mr. Yacht.

17:07.360 --> 17:11.440
And then you've gotta call the ghostbusters.

17:11.440 --> 17:12.240
Exactly.

17:12.240 --> 17:13.200
Obviously.

17:13.200 --> 17:14.000
Obviously.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.080
Guys, what kind of world do you live in?

17:16.080 --> 17:16.560
Let me ask.

17:16.560 --> 17:19.680
There's two worlds that we can live in and you can decide.

17:19.680 --> 17:20.160
Okay.

17:20.960 --> 17:23.920
I don't want to be in the one with the man made of chlamydia.

17:23.920 --> 17:24.560
If that's-

17:24.560 --> 17:36.400
Well, option A, do we want a world with like a Golgotha-esque demon made of venereal diseases?

17:36.400 --> 17:42.240
Or do we want to live in a world where super gonorrhea is a thing that anyone can get at

17:42.240 --> 17:44.160
any time for sitting on the wrong toilet seat?

17:44.160 --> 17:52.000
That's a really, when you make it the point like that, it seems a lot more compelling, actually.

17:52.000 --> 17:55.040
You can stay away from the Golgotha-esque demon.

17:55.040 --> 17:56.880
You can stay away from him.

17:56.880 --> 18:00.960
No, the good thing about the demon is that he gives us something concrete to fight.

18:00.960 --> 18:01.440
To fear?

18:01.440 --> 18:07.040
So often you hear people say, it's time for us to fight AIDS, but now it'll be like no real-

18:07.040 --> 18:10.640
Oh, if you could like fisticuffs just like go around and around with AIDS.

18:10.640 --> 18:14.960
Get a gun, hide behind those sandbags, and help us fight the AIDS monster.

18:14.960 --> 18:15.920
Do you hear about Jim?

18:15.920 --> 18:16.880
Oh, no, what?

18:16.880 --> 18:18.560
Totally took out AIDS the other day.

18:18.560 --> 18:19.040
Yeah.

18:19.040 --> 18:20.560
What if single-handedly with a saber-

18:20.560 --> 18:22.480
Beat the ever-loving shit out of it.

18:22.480 --> 18:23.280
Way to go.

18:23.280 --> 18:26.240
I'm uncomfortable with this question.

18:26.240 --> 18:30.000
I didn't know diseases can become super diseases if we let them go unchecked.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.600
Like, that's horrifying to me.

18:31.600 --> 18:32.160
Oh, yeah.

18:32.160 --> 18:32.720
Yeah.

18:32.720 --> 18:37.520
Well, and our over-reliance on antibiotics will make a lot of things untreatable.

18:37.520 --> 18:39.200
And then they evolve.

18:39.200 --> 18:41.440
Yeah, well, do you know what we can do?

18:41.440 --> 18:42.640
Like Pokemon.

18:42.640 --> 18:45.040
Do you know what we can do is catch them all.

18:45.040 --> 18:47.120
No, you know what we can do is-

18:47.120 --> 18:47.360
What?

18:48.160 --> 18:52.800
Get everybody to go to the hospital on the same day and then just cure them.

18:52.800 --> 18:53.840
Let's do another Yahoo.

18:54.640 --> 18:54.880
Okay.

18:55.520 --> 18:59.440
This is questions, of course, that we've taken from the Yahoo answer service.

18:59.440 --> 19:00.240
Stolen.

19:00.240 --> 19:02.160
Stolen-ish.

19:02.160 --> 19:02.960
Proloined.

19:03.520 --> 19:05.040
And are answering them.

19:05.040 --> 19:05.760
Dragooned.

19:07.520 --> 19:08.480
How about this one?

19:08.480 --> 19:10.080
This one was sent in by Elizabeth Kleven.

19:10.080 --> 19:11.040
Thank you, Elizabeth.

19:11.040 --> 19:13.520
It's by Yahoo Answers user Haley Judd, who asks,

19:14.560 --> 19:19.520
do you think it's a bad idea to name your kids after characters of your favorite movie?

19:21.200 --> 19:26.560
I really want to name my future kids after Harry Potter characters, but nothing too overbearing.

19:26.560 --> 19:33.520
I was thinking names like Ivana Luna, Aiden James, Hermione Evelyn, or Evelyn Hermione.

19:33.520 --> 19:33.760
No.

19:33.760 --> 19:34.880
Lily Charlotte.

19:34.880 --> 19:35.760
What do you think?

19:35.760 --> 19:38.560
If you're Harry Potter fans, add some of your opinions of names.

19:38.560 --> 19:38.960
Pools.

19:39.520 --> 19:40.800
Okay, I like Harry Potter.

19:40.800 --> 19:42.160
Don't fucking do that.

19:42.160 --> 19:44.000
This is my son Cookshanks Dobby.

19:44.560 --> 19:48.080
Yeah, this is Dobby Cookshanks.

19:48.800 --> 19:54.240
This is my son punch me right in the balls in, throw me in a locker, and leave me there forever.

19:54.240 --> 19:57.200
This is my son uninvited to every party ever.

19:57.760 --> 20:00.240
This is my son fart in my mouth in gym class.

20:00.240 --> 20:07.680
This is my son getting jacked on PCP and threw himself out a bedroom window.

20:07.680 --> 20:10.240
He's had a rough life.

20:10.240 --> 20:14.480
It's maybe dates back to, it's hard to pinpoint the exact moment,

20:14.480 --> 20:20.800
but it's probably when I decided to name him Hagrid Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans.

20:23.680 --> 20:29.760
Hi, I'm Stephen Voldemort, and I would appreciate it if you

20:29.760 --> 20:31.760
just stop bullying me just constantly.

20:31.760 --> 20:34.640
And if you do not mind, please stop saying my name out.

20:34.640 --> 20:35.760
It's disrespectful.

20:35.760 --> 20:36.800
It is troubling.

20:36.800 --> 20:38.560
Sorry, I'm not better at sports, but...

20:40.320 --> 20:43.680
And please, it's Steve, he who shall not be named.

20:43.680 --> 20:46.240
I'm Stephen, he who shall not be named.

20:46.240 --> 20:47.680
He who shall not be kissed.

20:51.200 --> 20:52.480
He who shall not be invited.

20:54.320 --> 20:55.040
Don't ever.

20:55.040 --> 20:56.640
He who shall not be successful.

20:56.640 --> 20:59.600
Poor kid. Don't ever do this.

20:59.600 --> 21:00.320
Don't do this thing.

21:00.320 --> 21:01.840
Don't do this thing that you're saying.

21:01.840 --> 21:03.360
This thing you've said, don't do this.

21:03.360 --> 21:08.240
Haley, don't do this thing because for the reasons that we've just outlined,

21:08.240 --> 21:12.400
and also Harry Potter's a book, not a movie, you dummy.

21:13.760 --> 21:15.840
I mean, it's also a movie, but it's a book first.

21:15.840 --> 21:19.600
And thirdly, there's so many other better movie names that you can use.

21:19.600 --> 21:19.760
Sure.

21:20.640 --> 21:23.040
I mean, Condorman, it's right there.

21:23.040 --> 21:29.120
Condorman, T-Rex from Jurassic Park is my favorite character.

21:30.960 --> 21:33.680
I mean, you could pretty much go any direction.

21:33.680 --> 21:37.120
This is my son, Val Kilmer Batman.

21:37.120 --> 21:37.760
Yeah.

21:37.760 --> 21:39.200
You have to be so specific.

21:39.200 --> 21:40.560
Yeah, you really do wanna be.

21:40.560 --> 21:46.320
You don't wanna be George Clooney just swarthing around with swarviness as that Batman.

21:46.320 --> 21:48.080
You want that Val Kilmer Batman.

21:48.080 --> 21:49.280
That's the recipe for success.

21:49.280 --> 21:51.280
No nipple Batman is the best Batman.

21:51.280 --> 21:52.960
It's the only Batman.

21:52.960 --> 21:53.680
The only Batman.

21:54.480 --> 21:59.680
One other thing, if you name your kid Hermione anything, who do you think you're fooling?

22:00.880 --> 22:01.600
That's true.

22:01.600 --> 22:03.840
Who do you think isn't gonna go, oh, Harry Potter?

22:03.840 --> 22:05.040
And you'd be like, no, no, no.

22:06.480 --> 22:08.720
I was way into that name before Harry Potter came out.

22:09.760 --> 22:13.600
The problem is you might be able to extract a name that would work for you,

22:13.600 --> 22:17.600
but you would have to get, to make it a name that's not immediately identifiable as a Harry

22:17.600 --> 22:23.600
Potter name, you'd have to get so deep catalog that I think the effect would be lost.

22:23.600 --> 22:28.480
Yeah, definitely don't name your offspring Hogwarts,

22:28.480 --> 22:30.240
because that's not an attractive name.

22:30.240 --> 22:34.080
Also, I think that tomorrow everybody should go to the hospital at the same time

22:34.080 --> 22:35.520
so we can finally cure Hogwarts.

22:39.520 --> 22:43.440
I have warts just up and down my hog.

22:45.440 --> 22:46.480
It is a bad scene.

22:46.480 --> 22:47.760
It is a bad scene down there.

22:50.880 --> 22:55.200
Up until two weeks ago, almost all my meals were provided either by my loving parents

22:55.200 --> 22:58.480
or the surprisingly excellent dining facilities at my university.

22:59.040 --> 23:02.240
Now, however, I've been living in an apartment for the past two weeks,

23:02.240 --> 23:07.280
and in that time, practically all I've managed to put into my body is an embarrassing amount

23:07.280 --> 23:10.160
of delivery pizza and chain restaurant burritos.

23:10.160 --> 23:12.240
And fuck, I'm hungry.

23:12.240 --> 23:15.440
I'm sick and tired of this, and I need new things to eat.

23:15.440 --> 23:18.080
What should I do to broaden my palette?

23:18.080 --> 23:19.600
That's from Culinary Child.

23:23.600 --> 23:28.000
Your first two or three years out of college, you're going to eat like an asshole, man.

23:29.040 --> 23:31.440
I ate like a fucking, I ate like a jerk.

23:32.080 --> 23:34.880
All I do is eat bacon and drink orange soda.

23:35.920 --> 23:40.160
Griffin would come over to my house after he got out of college.

23:40.160 --> 23:41.680
He would come over to my house sometimes,

23:41.680 --> 23:48.160
and he would have bags from fast food places that were so crowded around,

23:48.160 --> 23:49.840
I didn't even know they really existed.

23:50.640 --> 23:54.160
Those places you see, but no one ever actually eats there.

23:54.160 --> 23:55.600
Did you get a frost top?

23:55.600 --> 23:56.320
What are you doing?

23:57.200 --> 23:58.000
Chompers?

23:58.000 --> 24:00.240
That's not even a restaurant.

24:01.200 --> 24:02.800
Who goes to Chompers?

24:02.800 --> 24:04.640
Griffin, where the fuck did you find a Rax?

24:08.320 --> 24:10.560
Not only that, but I mean, I ate a lot of ramen.

24:10.560 --> 24:12.400
I would put hot dogs in the ramen.

24:12.400 --> 24:14.720
I'd be like, oh yeah, protein, what's up?

24:17.120 --> 24:18.400
Oh, it's such a bad scene.

24:19.040 --> 24:19.920
You got to do that though.

24:19.920 --> 24:20.640
You got to learn.

24:20.640 --> 24:22.240
You got to be carefully taught.

24:22.240 --> 24:25.760
The two things that I can actually recommend is one,

24:26.480 --> 24:35.280
find yourself a cooking guru, to use a popular phrase.

24:35.280 --> 24:40.560
Is it popular? Somebody on TV or who writes books that

24:42.160 --> 24:44.720
is sort of at your skill level, because there's different,

24:44.720 --> 24:47.920
different people are sort of doing different television shows,

24:47.920 --> 24:49.360
different books are in a different level.

24:49.360 --> 24:52.480
I like Alton Brown a lot.

24:52.480 --> 24:53.920
You can get on board with him.

24:53.920 --> 24:56.880
There's another guy, his name's the cooking guy,

24:56.880 --> 25:00.480
Sam Zien, I think, Z-I-E-N.

25:00.480 --> 25:04.160
And just start making some of the stuff that looks the easiest,

25:04.160 --> 25:05.360
and you build from there.

25:06.320 --> 25:11.120
If you go to the store, there are countless books that are written to be easy,

25:11.120 --> 25:15.120
that are like three ingredient meals and 10 minute meals,

25:15.120 --> 25:18.880
that kind of thing that are designed for people that are just starting out

25:18.880 --> 25:20.640
and cooking and have no idea what they're doing.

25:21.680 --> 25:26.960
The only thing is to be prepared that it takes some forethought to do

25:28.160 --> 25:32.720
any kind of cooking meals where you can't just throw a frozen pizza in the oven.

25:32.720 --> 25:35.040
You need to make sure you have all the ingredients.

25:35.040 --> 25:36.800
Get on board before you're hungry.

25:36.800 --> 25:39.040
I mean, get the wheel going before that.

25:39.040 --> 25:42.640
I actually prefer the culinary stylings of Paula Deen,

25:43.600 --> 25:48.560
because she cooks and eats like she's gonna commit suicide later that day.

25:49.760 --> 25:52.240
Yeah, like, fuck this, like, ah, fuck it.

25:52.240 --> 25:53.840
I'm gonna make a burger out of donuts.

25:53.840 --> 25:54.960
Fuck you and fuck me.

25:57.280 --> 26:01.360
She eats and cooks like her parents named her Severus Snape.

26:01.360 --> 26:02.800
I'm just ready to just wrap it up.

26:03.680 --> 26:06.640
And she drinks pudding pretty much.

26:06.640 --> 26:07.760
Out of a goblet.

26:09.360 --> 26:16.240
Yeah, so another good one is find recipes for things that you like to eat at restaurants.

26:16.800 --> 26:23.280
You know, like a Taste Just Like or, you know, copycat recipes, things like that,

26:23.280 --> 26:25.680
where you have something to weigh it against.

26:25.680 --> 26:29.600
Like, okay, I'm getting there because this tastes kind of like that thing I know I like.

26:29.600 --> 26:34.320
Do you guys have a meal that you, like, your go-to meal that you are, like,

26:34.320 --> 26:37.360
super good at making that was one of the first things you learned how to make?

26:37.360 --> 26:38.240
Like, for real?

26:38.240 --> 26:38.740
Yeah.

26:39.760 --> 26:46.880
You could do, it's pretty easy, like, Italian sausage and, like, chopped up, you know, bell peppers

26:46.880 --> 26:50.560
and some Parmesan cheese and noodles.

26:51.120 --> 26:54.000
And, like, you make, like, a pasta dish and it's, like, four ingredients.

26:54.000 --> 26:55.520
It's really, really easy.

26:55.520 --> 26:56.320
That's a good one.

26:56.320 --> 27:02.480
I make a, you boys have had it, they're, like, chimmy-ritos.

27:02.480 --> 27:04.400
Like, half chimichanga, half burritos.

27:05.040 --> 27:05.840
Make them the other.

27:05.840 --> 27:06.320
Oh, yeah.

27:06.320 --> 27:06.960
Remember that?

27:06.960 --> 27:07.600
That's good.

27:07.600 --> 27:10.800
If you want that recipe, I'll make sure I get in touch.

27:10.800 --> 27:14.160
Actually, I stole that from Sam Z and the cooking guy, so track him down.

27:14.160 --> 27:15.760
My jam is bacon-wrapped dates.

27:17.040 --> 27:17.760
Super easy to make.

27:17.760 --> 27:21.680
I mean, you can't eat it for a meal, but you can make it for a party and roll up to it.

27:21.680 --> 27:22.560
Like, what's up?

27:22.560 --> 27:23.600
Who brought this food?

27:23.600 --> 27:24.960
And be like, I made it.

27:24.960 --> 27:26.480
Did you really do that?

27:27.040 --> 27:27.760
Yeah.

27:27.760 --> 27:28.480
That's pretty cool.

27:29.600 --> 27:32.400
We had it up there that one time with Jordan and Jesse.

27:32.400 --> 27:33.760
Jesse was like, oh, you can make those.

27:33.760 --> 27:34.400
And then I made it.

27:34.400 --> 27:35.920
It's like, you can just make them.

27:37.040 --> 27:39.040
This isn't very funny, but it's...

27:39.040 --> 27:40.000
No, it's true.

27:40.000 --> 27:41.360
Everybody make bacon-wrapped dates.

27:41.360 --> 27:42.560
They're going to blow your mouth off your face.

27:42.560 --> 27:44.160
Do you know how I got started cooking?

27:44.160 --> 27:49.360
I got started and it's kind of cheesy and funny, but this book called A Man, a Can, and a Plan.

27:49.360 --> 27:50.720
You've talked about it before on this show.

27:50.720 --> 27:54.720
Yeah, and you can make it with, like, three canned ingredients, you know?

27:54.720 --> 27:59.200
And then I got started on that in college and making everything else, you know?

27:59.200 --> 28:03.760
But my advice right now is go to the store and just kind of walk the aisles and look

28:03.760 --> 28:05.360
for things that look interesting to you.

28:05.360 --> 28:10.160
And if you're like, oh, maybe a pasta dish tonight, and then go to the internet and look

28:10.160 --> 28:11.440
up different pasta recipes.

28:11.440 --> 28:12.720
You know, find something where you like...

28:12.720 --> 28:14.240
Don't get that recipe off Yahoo!

28:14.880 --> 28:15.440
No.

28:15.440 --> 28:16.000
Nope.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.080
Take your sister's hair and then...

28:22.320 --> 28:24.000
You can go to allrecipes.com.

28:24.000 --> 28:25.600
That's the one I normally use.

28:25.600 --> 28:26.320
I have my own...

28:26.320 --> 28:31.120
I have an account there and I have a little digital recipe box where I put all my jams.

28:31.760 --> 28:32.960
All my hot jams.

28:32.960 --> 28:35.760
Have you unlocked enough food points to get any cool avatars?

28:37.920 --> 28:38.640
Yes.

28:38.640 --> 28:42.240
All I do is browse recipes and give people comments.

28:42.240 --> 28:44.320
Helpful comments like, too much pepper.

28:44.320 --> 28:49.360
I unlocked the Mario Batali mustache yesterday and that really lets people know what level

28:49.360 --> 28:50.720
of cooking skill I'm working with.

28:50.720 --> 28:52.880
Anyway, listen.

28:52.880 --> 28:56.240
If I want to eat this week, I'm going to need some money.

28:56.240 --> 29:12.720
And to do that, to buy the food with the money, I need to go to the money store.

29:12.720 --> 29:14.320
Travis, who's driving this car?

29:15.040 --> 29:19.200
Well, first, Joanna would like to wish her boyfriend Robert a happy belated birthday.

29:19.200 --> 29:20.640
They've been together four years.

29:20.640 --> 29:25.920
She's a biomedical engineer technologist and he just finished a web page design course.

29:26.480 --> 29:27.680
He's going to be 24.

29:28.320 --> 29:29.600
They both love video games.

29:29.600 --> 29:34.640
Oh, he's also a guitarist and they live in Newfoundland, Canada.

29:34.640 --> 29:37.520
So, happy birthday, our neighbors to the north.

29:37.520 --> 29:39.520
Is he a shredder or a plucker?

29:39.520 --> 29:40.480
Does it say?

29:40.480 --> 29:41.600
He's a shred plucker.

29:41.600 --> 29:42.400
Plucker, shredder.

29:42.400 --> 29:47.840
I bet if you could combine plucker and shredder for long enough, it would be some pretty righteous

29:47.840 --> 29:48.640
profanity.

29:48.640 --> 29:51.680
I was just, it was playing around in my mouth.

29:51.680 --> 29:53.600
I was like, I don't know what I'm going to push out of here.

29:53.600 --> 29:54.640
Shrugger.

29:54.640 --> 29:55.440
Shrugger.

29:57.280 --> 29:59.680
Newfoundland is, of course, where Great Big C is from.

29:59.680 --> 30:00.480
They're a fine band.

30:00.480 --> 30:00.960
Oh, yes.

30:00.960 --> 30:01.200
Yeah.

30:02.240 --> 30:05.120
So, if you say hi, see them, just say hi.

30:05.120 --> 30:11.120
Jesse Wilson wants to congratulate Jordy Hoyt and Jill Krolik.

30:12.800 --> 30:13.600
Was that good?

30:13.600 --> 30:14.720
That wasn't very good.

30:14.720 --> 30:15.440
Krolik?

30:15.440 --> 30:16.400
Growlick.

30:16.400 --> 30:18.960
Growlick.

30:18.960 --> 30:19.920
Jill Hermione.

30:22.560 --> 30:26.720
They, oh my God, they got married on Saturday.

30:26.720 --> 30:28.640
Oh, that's a talk.

30:28.640 --> 30:29.840
Talk about recent.

30:29.840 --> 30:32.960
Jordy is a programmer at Amazon.

30:33.520 --> 30:39.520
Jill's a scientist, and they got cats, and Jill loves squirrels, and Jordy loves beer,

30:40.400 --> 30:43.120
and their cats love when squirrels drink beer.

30:43.120 --> 30:49.600
I made that last one up, but they were roommates originally, and then they fell in love.

30:51.120 --> 30:56.480
Yeah, but they said they started liking each other, but when I read it initially,

30:56.480 --> 30:57.920
it said they started killing each other.

30:58.960 --> 31:00.160
That's not what happened.

31:00.160 --> 31:03.200
It's like, oh, they have a Mr. and Mrs. Smith thing going on.

31:03.200 --> 31:04.480
That's adorable.

31:04.480 --> 31:08.240
So, congratulations to Jordy and Jill.

31:08.240 --> 31:10.000
Oh, and got one more.

31:10.000 --> 31:17.760
Tim Harrison is one of Andy Turino's closest friends, and it's his 23rd birthday on July 19th.

31:19.440 --> 31:20.240
Tim's awesome.

31:20.240 --> 31:22.080
He got a job at ForumSpring.

31:22.080 --> 31:28.560
He introduced Andy to our show, this program, and they're both Maximum Fun donors, which we love,

31:29.360 --> 31:33.040
and it's Tim's birthday, so we love him.

31:33.040 --> 31:34.480
It was Tim's birthday.

31:34.480 --> 31:35.440
It was Tim's birthday.

31:35.440 --> 31:36.080
We missed it.

31:36.080 --> 31:37.200
By about a week.

31:37.200 --> 31:37.840
Sorry, Tim.

31:37.840 --> 31:40.000
Did my best.

31:40.000 --> 31:40.960
My best on the program.

31:40.960 --> 31:44.160
When Tim met Andy, it was in primary school.

31:44.800 --> 31:45.920
I don't understand what that means.

31:47.680 --> 31:49.840
Like, you know how wizard school works?

31:49.840 --> 31:50.560
Yeah, okay.

31:51.200 --> 31:55.920
Tim met Andy, and the first words he said to him were,

31:55.920 --> 31:59.760
you have holes in your brain, which I think scared the shit out of Andy.

31:59.760 --> 32:00.720
Wait, holy shit.

32:00.720 --> 32:02.720
Was that a quantum leap reference?

32:03.440 --> 32:04.480
I hope so.

32:04.480 --> 32:09.600
I hope this friendship is founded on the back of Dr. Samuel Beckett.

32:09.600 --> 32:11.600
Oh, you have Swiss cheese brain.

32:11.600 --> 32:13.200
You have Swiss cheese memory.

32:13.200 --> 32:15.360
Oh, with America's treasure, Scott Bakkila.

32:16.240 --> 32:16.720
Thank you.

32:17.280 --> 32:18.480
Thank you, Scott Bakkila.

32:18.480 --> 32:19.440
Thank you, Scott Bakkila.

32:19.440 --> 32:20.640
Thank you, Money Zone.

32:20.640 --> 32:23.440
Thank you, Andy and Jesse and Joanna.

32:24.160 --> 32:24.960
You guys are the best.

32:25.600 --> 32:26.480
And Scott.

32:26.480 --> 32:27.520
Give us a map, Scott.

32:27.520 --> 32:29.440
Also, a quick, quick correction.

32:29.440 --> 32:31.120
Quick, minor.

32:31.120 --> 32:32.640
We fucked up last week.

32:32.640 --> 32:34.320
We goofed it pretty hard.

32:35.760 --> 32:42.320
You may remember the plight of Kim, who was honored in a message by Hayden.

32:42.960 --> 32:46.240
I said that Kim was a speech therapist and also in law school,

32:46.240 --> 32:49.200
and then I commented on how she was doing too many things with her life

32:49.200 --> 32:51.120
and how she needs to settle down, girlfriend.

32:52.400 --> 32:56.400
Turns out that Kim is a speech therapist and Hayden is in law school.

32:57.040 --> 33:00.480
She's just super lazy, I guess, and can only handle one thing at a time.

33:00.480 --> 33:05.040
Yeah, so we're marginally less impressed with her than we were last week.

33:05.040 --> 33:08.800
We are completely comfortable saying when Griffin was wrong.

33:08.800 --> 33:10.800
Yeah, I was super wrong, and I'm so sorry.

33:10.800 --> 33:12.320
And please forgive me.

33:12.320 --> 33:13.600
But hey, onward and upward.

33:14.480 --> 33:15.520
I recently moved-

33:15.520 --> 33:16.720
Hey, wait a second.

33:16.720 --> 33:16.960
What?

33:18.080 --> 33:19.360
Ah, motherfucker.

33:20.480 --> 33:21.040
I can't do it.

33:21.040 --> 33:33.360
I don't got my geek.

33:33.360 --> 33:34.560
Joanne loves Robert.

33:35.920 --> 33:40.880
Robert loves data and design and web page design.

33:43.840 --> 33:45.120
Jordy works at Amazon.

33:46.480 --> 33:47.680
Jill is a scientist.

33:47.680 --> 33:50.880
They love their cats, I guess.

33:50.880 --> 33:55.280
Hey Andy, hey Tim, did you fall in love?

33:56.080 --> 33:56.640
You didn't.

33:57.840 --> 33:58.880
You fell in friend.

34:01.840 --> 34:05.280
This song just got bought by John Cougar Mellencamp.

34:06.720 --> 34:08.480
He said it's like one of his.

34:10.480 --> 34:12.480
He said Justin, it doesn't rhyme.

34:13.600 --> 34:16.160
Doesn't need to rhyme when it's a poem.

34:16.160 --> 34:18.640
Doesn't need to rhyme when it's about America.

34:21.200 --> 34:23.360
Capturing the American dream.

34:26.880 --> 34:28.000
I'm sorry, Kim.

34:29.760 --> 34:30.400
And Hayden.

34:32.000 --> 34:32.720
And America.

34:34.400 --> 34:37.200
And John Cougar Mellencamp.

34:42.320 --> 34:43.120
Thanks.

34:43.120 --> 34:44.000
He listens, you know.

34:44.000 --> 34:45.680
Yeah, he's a big fan.

34:47.200 --> 34:50.720
So I recently moved into a apartment with two other wonderful people and trying to come

34:50.720 --> 34:56.000
up with a name to refer to it as the ranch, the old place, but nothing is really stuck.

34:56.000 --> 34:59.120
My roommate, my roommate and me are getting desperate.

34:59.120 --> 34:59.600
Help us.

34:59.600 --> 35:00.320
That's from Tom.

35:00.960 --> 35:05.520
I think that the ranch and the old place and like the commune and stuff, that's pretty

35:05.520 --> 35:05.920
cool.

35:05.920 --> 35:07.440
But let me pitch this.

35:08.960 --> 35:13.760
What about like an old timey southern plantation name?

35:13.760 --> 35:14.320
Oh, wow.

35:14.320 --> 35:16.320
Like have you called it like Belle Rouge?

35:17.120 --> 35:17.840
Oh, my God.

35:19.200 --> 35:20.080
I love that.

35:20.640 --> 35:22.320
Listen, none of us.

35:22.320 --> 35:24.080
This is my home La Croix.

35:24.080 --> 35:25.200
In our lifetimes.

35:26.400 --> 35:33.680
The main point here is that the reason for naming a place is that it's easier to lure

35:34.560 --> 35:41.120
members of the opposite sex or same sex, if that's your bag, into it without it sounding

35:41.120 --> 35:45.200
like let me come to the place where I sleep and make duties and showers.

35:46.080 --> 35:48.080
And I think it's important that this place sounds safe.

35:48.640 --> 35:48.960
Safe.

35:50.960 --> 35:52.640
Do not go with the kill cube.

35:54.400 --> 35:56.800
Whatever you do, avoid the honey trap.

36:00.960 --> 36:02.240
Welcome to my lair.

36:03.280 --> 36:04.560
Let's head back to the lair.

36:08.160 --> 36:09.680
The fortress of bonitude.

36:09.680 --> 36:10.880
That's bad.

36:12.480 --> 36:14.560
Pussy torture zone is awful.

36:14.560 --> 36:15.360
Don't go with that one.

36:15.360 --> 36:15.920
Yeah.

36:15.920 --> 36:16.800
Chuck E. Cheese's.

36:17.920 --> 36:23.280
You could keep the government off your tail by calling it something that is already prominent.

36:23.280 --> 36:25.520
Like if you say the library or something.

36:25.520 --> 36:26.320
Let's see that word.

36:26.320 --> 36:27.440
Or McDonald's.

36:28.720 --> 36:31.520
What if you just called it like the church of the divine light?

36:32.240 --> 36:32.800
Oh, shit.

36:34.320 --> 36:34.560
Yeah.

36:35.120 --> 36:35.760
Very clever.

36:36.880 --> 36:37.360
Kids camp.

36:37.360 --> 36:38.960
Kids camp.

36:38.960 --> 36:39.460
Great.

36:41.280 --> 36:42.080
Come on.

36:42.080 --> 36:43.920
I'm going to make love to you at kids camp.

36:43.920 --> 36:44.480
What?

36:44.480 --> 36:45.360
That was a Z.

36:45.360 --> 36:47.200
Ooh, call it space camp.

36:47.200 --> 36:48.720
Everybody wants to go to space camp.

36:49.280 --> 36:52.080
I think space camp is probably the best name.

36:52.080 --> 36:55.920
And then you can make like all kinds of like, and I'm going to take you out of this world.

36:57.920 --> 36:58.480
Yeah.

36:58.480 --> 36:59.760
I'm about ready to launch.

37:00.640 --> 37:02.320
Houston, we have a problem.

37:02.320 --> 37:05.520
All right.

37:05.520 --> 37:07.280
The problem is that I already launched.

37:07.280 --> 37:08.240
That's my bad.

37:08.240 --> 37:09.360
That's on me, Houston.

37:10.800 --> 37:13.600
You could get a console set up like a whole.

37:13.600 --> 37:14.320
Oh, yeah.

37:14.320 --> 37:16.960
Lots of knobs and switches in there.

37:16.960 --> 37:17.760
I love that.

37:17.760 --> 37:20.640
And then pretend like you're talking to Houston just constantly.

37:20.640 --> 37:21.200
Listen.

37:21.200 --> 37:23.920
T minus nine, eight, seven.

37:23.920 --> 37:26.560
Yeah, these are all, this is all going to work out super well.

37:26.560 --> 37:27.600
Yeah, this is going to be great.

37:27.600 --> 37:30.560
Listen, NASA has discontinued its shuttle program.

37:30.560 --> 37:32.800
We got to have somewhere to go from here.

37:32.800 --> 37:38.560
The dream of interplanetary exploration is alive in my bedroom.

37:39.760 --> 37:48.480
So come, let us extend our national dream of traveling through the stars as I make a

37:48.480 --> 37:50.960
brief love to you.

37:50.960 --> 37:53.600
And then later I make you something from the kitchen.

37:54.560 --> 37:55.840
Which we call the galley.

37:55.840 --> 37:58.080
We call the galley, technically speaking.

37:58.080 --> 38:01.600
Can we just name the house a person's name and then have it sort of be a character in

38:01.600 --> 38:02.240
their story?

38:02.960 --> 38:05.040
Like this is Steve the house?

38:05.040 --> 38:05.920
This is Dennis.

38:05.920 --> 38:07.200
This is my house, Dennis.

38:08.160 --> 38:09.280
It's very spacious.

38:09.280 --> 38:09.920
I live in Houston.

38:09.920 --> 38:13.760
And then you pretend like it's like haunted and you talk to it and like, Dennis, it's

38:13.760 --> 38:14.480
cold in here.

38:15.840 --> 38:17.440
Wait, is Dennis your butler?

38:18.080 --> 38:20.560
Well, it's more like a house spirit.

38:21.600 --> 38:25.840
Dennis, your spirit has, your ectoplasm has given me a chill.

38:25.840 --> 38:28.080
How can you ever move, though?

38:28.080 --> 38:29.600
Yeah, you leave Dennis behind.

38:29.600 --> 38:30.480
You gotta burn it down.

38:31.760 --> 38:35.040
Dennis, as with all friendships, when you have to leave one of your friends, you must

38:35.040 --> 38:35.520
kill them.

38:35.520 --> 38:37.520
If I can't have you, no one can, Dennis.

38:37.520 --> 38:39.040
Is it, was Dennis the name of the house?

38:39.040 --> 38:39.440
I forget.

38:39.440 --> 38:40.960
Dennis is the name of the house.

38:40.960 --> 38:45.840
And it's going to be awkward because every time you walk into or out of the house, it's

38:45.840 --> 38:48.560
like Dennis is either eating you or throwing you up.

38:50.320 --> 38:52.000
And don't go in the back door.

38:52.000 --> 38:55.680
Hey, hey, listen, I've had a great time talking with you tonight.

38:55.680 --> 38:58.000
Uh, I'd like this to continue.

38:58.560 --> 39:01.520
Do you want to crawl inside my friend Dennis' mouth and have sex?

39:03.200 --> 39:07.840
Can we go in and out of the back door repeatedly and have sex with our house Dennis?

39:09.200 --> 39:10.400
For Dennis sake.

39:10.400 --> 39:12.320
Why are you trying to have sex with the house Dennis?

39:12.320 --> 39:17.280
Why can't, why can't we not just at once have a question that's about houses that have

39:17.280 --> 39:18.560
names?

39:18.560 --> 39:23.040
Yeah, like, why does it always have to have to turn into a pornographic?

39:23.040 --> 39:26.000
Have you guys ever seen the movie Monster House?

39:26.000 --> 39:26.720
It'd be like that.

39:27.840 --> 39:28.720
It wouldn't though.

39:31.360 --> 39:34.000
I mean, if you think about it, it wouldn't be like that at all.

39:34.000 --> 39:39.600
Have you guys ever seen the movie, um, the Money Trap starring Tom Hanks?

39:40.160 --> 39:41.280
You're thinking of the Honey Trap.

39:42.400 --> 39:43.680
The Money Pit, you mean?

39:43.680 --> 39:45.280
The Money Trap Pit.

39:45.920 --> 39:47.600
The Money Pit Pit.

39:47.600 --> 39:50.080
Are you thinking they should name the house the Money Pit?

39:50.080 --> 39:54.000
Can they name it Scott Bakkila?

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
Can they name the house Scott Bakkila?

39:56.000 --> 39:57.040
This is my house.

39:57.040 --> 40:00.240
America's, America's Treasurer Scott Bakkila.

40:00.240 --> 40:02.320
America's Treasurer Scott Bakkila.

40:02.320 --> 40:03.360
I live in him.

40:03.360 --> 40:07.840
I live inside Scott Bakkila.

40:07.840 --> 40:09.120
Can we take it to the next level?

40:09.120 --> 40:09.600
Okay.

40:09.600 --> 40:15.680
Can, can the three of you, assuming you're not on a long lease that you would be penalized

40:15.680 --> 40:18.720
for leaving, can you just go live inside of Scott Bakkila?

40:18.720 --> 40:20.240
Like inner space style?

40:20.240 --> 40:21.520
Like inner space style.

40:21.520 --> 40:22.800
Live in his guts.

40:23.600 --> 40:28.000
Are you saying they need to invent shrinking technology technology?

40:28.000 --> 40:28.800
Where do you live?

40:28.800 --> 40:30.880
Just send that letter straight to Scott.

40:30.880 --> 40:37.120
Uh, just PO box, Scott, and, uh, I've attached some notes and stuff to his eyeballs so I

40:37.120 --> 40:38.160
can read it too.

40:38.160 --> 40:40.000
Wait, don't read my mail, Scott.

40:43.520 --> 40:44.000
That's weird.

40:44.000 --> 40:47.280
All these letters just keep getting mailed to me, but it just says Scott Bakkila.

40:47.280 --> 40:49.680
To me, but it just says Scott on it.

40:49.680 --> 40:50.400
Oh, that's mine.

40:51.120 --> 40:51.920
Just eat the letter.

40:51.920 --> 40:52.400
I'll get it.

40:58.080 --> 41:01.920
If I could control Scott Bakkila's body from the inside, starting inner space, quantum

41:01.920 --> 41:03.360
leap to day one.

41:04.560 --> 41:05.920
You guys don't even know.

41:05.920 --> 41:06.560
Leaped again.

41:08.000 --> 41:08.480
You're right.

41:08.480 --> 41:08.960
Oh boy.

41:08.960 --> 41:09.920
Here I go again.

41:09.920 --> 41:10.320
So you-

41:10.320 --> 41:15.440
There are tiny people in my body making me make this poor decision.

41:18.160 --> 41:28.000
Basically, Scott Bakkila's manager would get a call and he said, hi, is this a manager?

41:28.000 --> 41:28.240
Yes.

41:30.640 --> 41:32.400
This is definitely Scott Bakkila.

41:34.320 --> 41:36.720
These are definitely aren't people inside of Scott Bakkila.

41:38.000 --> 41:39.200
So wait, wait, wait.

41:39.200 --> 41:43.440
This is gone from living in Scott Bakkila to controlling it like Meet Dave style.

41:44.080 --> 41:46.720
Like you're inside Scott Bakkila's head piloting.

41:46.720 --> 41:47.280
That's where we're at, Travis.

41:47.280 --> 41:47.600
Keep up.

41:47.600 --> 41:48.080
Exactly.

41:48.880 --> 41:50.880
That's exactly the situation.

41:51.840 --> 41:53.680
Can you put me on a TV show?

41:53.680 --> 41:54.160
What kind?

41:55.200 --> 41:56.320
Quantum leap is pretty good.

41:58.080 --> 42:03.360
You know how we've been itching to start on quantum leap to the sequel to a TV show?

42:05.920 --> 42:08.480
That thing that, of course, people do all the time?

42:08.480 --> 42:12.000
If they're bringing back Dallas, can't they bring back-

42:13.200 --> 42:15.840
I'm willing to bet they wouldn't call it quantum leap 2.

42:15.840 --> 42:17.680
I think they could just call it quantum leap.

42:18.400 --> 42:20.160
Quantum leap colon some more.

42:20.720 --> 42:25.040
As everyone knows, he took a brief sabbatical and never returned home.

42:25.040 --> 42:26.320
He's still out there leaping.

42:26.320 --> 42:26.640
He is.

42:27.200 --> 42:28.800
That show had a very ambiguous ending.

42:28.800 --> 42:30.560
I'm saying it's up to us to shrink ourselves,

42:30.560 --> 42:34.640
lip and Scott Bakkila's body and control him to create quantum leap 2.

42:34.640 --> 42:35.280
Still leaping.

42:37.040 --> 42:37.600
Leaped again.

42:37.600 --> 42:40.560
How much money?

42:40.560 --> 42:42.640
How much dollar do you want me to push for, Scott?

42:42.640 --> 42:46.000
Just the regular amount.

42:46.000 --> 42:48.800
However much I normally get from shows.

42:48.800 --> 42:50.080
Can we three times that money?

42:50.080 --> 42:52.480
Can we triple it and then split it with your-

42:52.480 --> 42:53.440
And then shrink it.

42:53.440 --> 42:55.360
I got a lot of mini mouths to feed.

42:55.360 --> 42:56.800
I have mini mouths to feed.

42:56.800 --> 43:00.320
I mean, by which I mean tiny mouths that live inside me.

43:00.320 --> 43:02.240
Can we make Scott Bakkila giant?

43:04.160 --> 43:05.520
Seriously, not shrink down.

43:05.520 --> 43:07.520
We just blow up Scott Bakkila.

43:07.520 --> 43:08.640
Oh, my God.

43:08.640 --> 43:12.400
You guys have just set up a reality where we can have a battle between

43:12.400 --> 43:15.520
giant Scott Bakkila and giant gonorrhea.

43:18.080 --> 43:20.240
Waging a war.

43:22.000 --> 43:23.440
Laser shooting out of his eyes.

43:23.440 --> 43:24.080
He's leaping.

43:24.080 --> 43:26.880
Although I don't know why he would have laser technology.

43:26.880 --> 43:28.640
He's just big Scott Bakkila.

43:29.360 --> 43:31.600
Well, you know, bigger.

43:31.600 --> 43:32.000
Why not?

43:32.000 --> 43:34.720
I mean, if you're going to shoot for the stars, shoot for the stars.

43:34.720 --> 43:34.960
Yeah.

43:34.960 --> 43:37.920
Yeah, don't limit yourself here.

43:37.920 --> 43:38.880
We got to dream big.

43:39.520 --> 43:42.880
So we're all going to go to Scott Bakkila, get inside him at once.

43:42.880 --> 43:47.600
And what if we just gave Scott Bakkila the antibodies to fight gonorrhea,

43:47.600 --> 43:50.240
and then it would just live and you would live inside him and be cured.

43:51.040 --> 43:51.520
Oh, OK.

43:51.520 --> 43:52.720
So he's like an incubator.

43:52.720 --> 43:54.640
He's like a water slide is what you're saying.

43:55.920 --> 43:59.760
Like every every person on Earth would have to go through Scott Bakkila's body

43:59.760 --> 44:01.600
and then they would be free of diseases.

44:01.600 --> 44:03.120
I don't understand what you're saying.

44:03.120 --> 44:05.280
Yeah, Scott Bakkila needs to eat everybody.

44:05.280 --> 44:07.040
That's what I'm telling you.

44:07.040 --> 44:08.640
Giant Scott Bakkila, not regular Scott Bakkila.

44:08.640 --> 44:11.360
So to answer your question about what to name your apartment,

44:11.360 --> 44:13.840
Scott Bakkila should eat everybody in the world.

44:15.440 --> 44:17.680
Glad that we can help with that one.

44:17.680 --> 44:19.840
No, giant Scott Bakkila should eat everybody in the world.

44:19.840 --> 44:22.160
Sorry, I meant to say giant Scott Bakkila.

44:22.160 --> 44:25.680
If if regular Scott Bakkila eats people, he's he's ham-electar.

44:25.680 --> 44:29.360
Oh, and so then so he absorbs all the gonorrhea

44:29.360 --> 44:32.720
and then flies into space and explodes, saving everyone on Earth.

44:32.720 --> 44:34.080
But sacrificing himself.

44:34.080 --> 44:36.320
This rain is really weird.

44:36.320 --> 44:41.200
It smells like Scott Bakkila and gonorrhea in rain form.

44:41.920 --> 44:43.200
Why did we come out today?

44:43.840 --> 44:45.520
Let's stop this game of catch.

44:45.520 --> 44:46.480
I'm over it.

44:47.440 --> 44:48.640
Let's do a Yahoo.

44:48.640 --> 44:49.040
All right.

44:49.040 --> 44:50.640
This one was sent in by Joseph Hennessy.

44:52.080 --> 44:54.400
It's by Yahoo Answers user Ryan who asks,

44:54.400 --> 44:57.120
how can I successfully become a creepy person?

44:57.920 --> 45:00.000
Hi, I would like to become a creepy person,

45:00.000 --> 45:02.720
not just to the eyes of one other, but for everybody.

45:02.720 --> 45:07.840
What procedures should I follow in order to become an ephetis creepy person?

45:07.840 --> 45:08.160
Thanks.

45:09.040 --> 45:09.360
What?

45:10.000 --> 45:10.880
Excuse me?

45:10.880 --> 45:15.040
I feel like getting on Yahoo Answers is a good first step in the right direction.

45:15.040 --> 45:16.640
You are fucking halfway there.

45:16.640 --> 45:17.280
Are you kidding me?

45:18.160 --> 45:21.520
I think that beginning your Yahoo Answers question with hello

45:21.520 --> 45:23.920
is a good step to hello, internet.

45:23.920 --> 45:24.160
Hi.

45:24.720 --> 45:25.840
I know one in particular.

45:26.480 --> 45:26.800
It's me.

45:28.560 --> 45:29.680
Talk like that.

45:29.680 --> 45:30.400
That's good.

45:30.400 --> 45:31.680
There's the best answer.

45:31.680 --> 45:34.800
I was voted by Yahoo Answers users.

45:37.440 --> 45:39.040
Their username is just period.

45:39.040 --> 45:40.240
It's just one period.

45:40.240 --> 45:44.320
And they said, never frown, even when you're sad,

45:44.320 --> 45:46.800
because you never know who's falling in love with your smile.

45:47.760 --> 45:49.440
So basically just do that.

45:49.440 --> 45:52.560
Like basically just do what that person just did and said to you.

45:53.440 --> 45:54.960
Say those things to people.

45:54.960 --> 45:56.240
In that exact order.

45:56.240 --> 46:00.240
The secret to being a creep is to imagine a reality

46:00.240 --> 46:02.560
in which Paul Giamatti has no acting talent.

46:03.200 --> 46:06.320
And if you can act like that, like Paul Giamatti,

46:06.320 --> 46:11.200
but without the redeeming quality of his wonderful acting,

46:11.920 --> 46:14.320
that to me is the quintessential creep.

46:14.320 --> 46:15.040
A second.

46:15.040 --> 46:18.560
I thought that you were just saying if you want to be a creepy person-

46:18.560 --> 46:23.120
The attitude that someone would have if Paul Giamatti didn't have any acting ability.

46:23.120 --> 46:26.240
Yeah, like Paul Giamatti had never acted.

46:26.240 --> 46:28.000
Paul Giamatti sucks at acting.

46:28.000 --> 46:30.160
Oh, that guy's, you're such a creep for saying that.

46:30.160 --> 46:31.920
I thought that that was what you were saying at first.

46:31.920 --> 46:32.320
No, no.

46:32.320 --> 46:33.040
You know who I hate?

46:33.040 --> 46:33.920
Paul Giamatti.

46:33.920 --> 46:34.880
Ew, get out of here.

46:35.840 --> 46:36.560
Get out of here, you creep.

46:36.560 --> 46:39.440
Oh, I thought you were talking like an alternate reality kind of circumstance

46:39.440 --> 46:44.240
where if we lived in a world where Paul Giamatti didn't have any acting ability-

46:44.240 --> 46:46.720
Oh shit, or he just never tried it.

46:46.720 --> 46:46.960
Yeah.

46:46.960 --> 46:48.960
That's fucking, that's fucking F1.

46:48.960 --> 46:52.800
Listen, giant Sam Beckett, Paul Giamatti is never gonna act.

46:52.800 --> 46:54.800
You've got to convince him to go to the audition.

46:55.680 --> 46:56.320
And then-

46:56.320 --> 46:57.920
Oh, boy.

47:04.240 --> 47:04.880
Oh, God.

47:08.960 --> 47:09.280
Sorry.

47:15.840 --> 47:16.720
Let's stop the show.

47:16.720 --> 47:23.360
My, here's the thing.

47:23.360 --> 47:27.040
If you ever see me in person, just walk up to me and say Giant's Calvacula.

47:27.040 --> 47:31.440
And I'll just start, I promise you I will always find that idea entertaining.

47:33.120 --> 47:35.040
You know what the worst part about doing this show is?

47:35.040 --> 47:38.640
I'm gonna have to walk out my office door and I'm gonna walk in a world where there

47:38.640 --> 47:40.320
isn't a Giant's Calvacula.

47:40.320 --> 47:41.680
And here in this sphere-

47:42.320 --> 47:44.160
Can we stay in this dreamscape forever?

47:44.160 --> 47:48.560
Well, listen, thank you for coming into this dreamscape with us.

47:50.080 --> 47:53.520
We're so happy to have you and so happy that you guys have stuck with us.

47:54.400 --> 48:01.600
If you get a second, tell somebody you know, say, hey, listen, this show is gonna start slow.

48:01.600 --> 48:04.640
And then at the end, it's gonna really go on a journey.

48:04.640 --> 48:07.760
So I need you to go on it with me because I can't do this alone, I'm afraid.

48:09.200 --> 48:10.400
And share the show.

48:10.400 --> 48:11.360
Share the show with somebody you care about.

48:11.360 --> 48:14.800
If you know Scott Baccala, can you try and get him on board?

48:14.800 --> 48:16.800
Because I feel like we had some pretty good ideas for him.

48:18.000 --> 48:18.560
Career-wise.

48:18.560 --> 48:20.640
Some real advances we want to make to his career.

48:20.640 --> 48:21.680
I think we're really gonna turn this whole thing around.

48:21.680 --> 48:24.080
We're really gonna blow him up and then we're gonna blow him up.

48:25.440 --> 48:29.680
And then we're gonna blow up his cell because everybody wants a piece of him and they can.

48:29.680 --> 48:32.240
He's large enough that I can get a sliver.

48:33.200 --> 48:36.800
This is my chunk of the Berlin Wall and this is my chunk of Scott Baccala that I took.

48:36.800 --> 48:38.640
This is my glowing piece of that radical rock.

48:39.360 --> 48:40.720
This is my piece of the agrocrack.

48:40.720 --> 48:42.400
Your mantle's fucking weird, man.

48:42.400 --> 48:44.720
It's a weird mantle, dude.

48:44.720 --> 48:46.400
Got some weird-ass tchotchkes up in here.

48:47.280 --> 48:54.160
If you go to maximumfun.org forward slash jumbotron, you can do just like Joanna and

48:54.160 --> 48:58.480
Jesse and Andy did and say something to a friend.

48:58.480 --> 49:01.920
Corporations, if you got a business you want us to plug, we do that too.

49:02.640 --> 49:03.520
We got forums.

49:03.520 --> 49:05.600
It's also at maximumfun.org as long as you're there.

49:05.600 --> 49:06.320
Go check it out.

49:06.320 --> 49:12.080
If you want to send us a question or a Yahoo question, our email is nbmbam at gmail.com.

49:12.080 --> 49:13.360
You can just shoot us one there.

49:13.360 --> 49:15.280
Or nbmbam at maximumfun.org.

49:15.280 --> 49:15.520
Yes.

49:16.080 --> 49:16.800
Either one works.

49:18.160 --> 49:21.760
Thank you so much to John Roderick and the Long Winners for letting us use the song

49:22.320 --> 49:24.000
It's a Departure as our theme song.

49:25.280 --> 49:29.600
It's on the album Putting the Days to Bed, which no joke is a fucking phenomenal album.

49:30.720 --> 49:34.320
Say thanks to John Roderick is just at John Roderick on Twitter.

49:34.320 --> 49:35.360
So say thanks to him.

49:35.360 --> 49:38.080
Say, hey, hey, you rock really good.

49:38.080 --> 49:40.000
You walk so right.

49:41.680 --> 49:44.960
I see on here that Isolated in Indianapolis owes us a cheesecake.

49:44.960 --> 49:46.080
Is this accurate?

49:46.080 --> 49:46.320
Yeah.

49:46.320 --> 49:51.120
She let us know that, you know, we talked last week directly to her boyfriend and told

49:51.120 --> 49:52.080
him to move.

49:52.080 --> 49:56.960
And then she, I think, made the mistake of listening to the episode with him.

49:57.680 --> 50:01.040
And now he is moving to Indianapolis to be with her.

50:01.040 --> 50:04.400
And she informed us that her cheesecakes are, in fact, amazing.

50:04.400 --> 50:09.280
So in my opinion, she owes us, but more specifically me, a cheesecake.

50:09.280 --> 50:13.040
The good news is we helped save this relationship.

50:13.040 --> 50:15.760
The bad news is that someone did one of the things we told them to do.

50:15.760 --> 50:16.160
Yes.

50:16.160 --> 50:17.920
Which we cannot stress enough.

50:17.920 --> 50:19.360
You really should not do that.

50:19.360 --> 50:20.080
Don't ever do that.

50:20.080 --> 50:21.360
Unless you are Scott Bakkila.

50:22.160 --> 50:24.320
Speaking of which, thanks to Bob Ball, who does our intro.

50:24.320 --> 50:24.640
Thank you, Bob.

50:24.640 --> 50:25.040
We love him.

50:25.840 --> 50:27.440
I went to Red Lobster with Bob this week.

50:27.440 --> 50:28.240
What'd you get?

50:28.240 --> 50:28.720
Cheese rolls?

50:28.720 --> 50:28.960
What?

50:28.960 --> 50:30.080
Did you get some of those cheese rolls?

50:30.080 --> 50:31.120
Did you win the shrimp?

50:31.120 --> 50:31.440
What did you eat?

50:31.440 --> 50:32.400
Did you win the shrimp?

50:32.400 --> 50:35.520
A day with a Red Lobster visit without Cheddar Bay.

50:35.520 --> 50:36.080
What's the point?

50:36.080 --> 50:37.680
Are we talking scampi?

50:37.680 --> 50:39.120
Are we talking fried coconut?

50:39.120 --> 50:41.200
I did a little bit of both, you know.

50:42.640 --> 50:44.480
So thanks to everybody.

50:47.120 --> 50:50.240
We love it when you tweet about the show on Twitter,

50:51.680 --> 50:54.560
which seems like the best place to put tweets.

50:55.280 --> 50:56.960
Just use the M-E-M-E-A-M hashtag.

50:56.960 --> 51:01.520
The best thing about it is when people don't tweet anything about the show,

51:01.520 --> 51:03.120
just something that's going on in their life,

51:03.120 --> 51:05.680
and then put the M-E-M-E-A-M hashtag for some reason.

51:05.680 --> 51:06.640
I like that, though.

51:06.640 --> 51:07.440
I like that.

51:07.440 --> 51:09.200
Just keep it going.

51:09.200 --> 51:10.080
Share the show with people.

51:10.080 --> 51:11.600
And hey, if you're telling somebody about it,
