The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:47.920
Hello everybody, welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me, an advice show for the modern

00:47.920 --> 00:52.240
era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middlest brother, Travis McElroy.

00:52.240 --> 00:55.920
I'm the baby, I almost said middlest, but I'm not a middlest. You're not.

00:55.920 --> 00:58.640
I'm not the middlest. Copyright infringement.

01:02.880 --> 01:08.160
We're back with another episode of our advice podcast. It's a little late. It's been

01:10.320 --> 01:13.120
a kind of, it's been a day. It's been a few days.

01:14.080 --> 01:15.120
What happened?

01:15.120 --> 01:16.880
It's been a harrowing five days.

01:18.000 --> 01:24.480
Okay, so let me give you my story real quick. Saturday morning is the day before my birthday,

01:24.480 --> 01:29.840
and oh my God, my baby is puking every hour on the hour. And babies are rad when they puke,

01:29.840 --> 01:34.480
because like human beings, adult human beings, if they got puked, you see that look in their eyes

01:34.480 --> 01:37.040
like, oh God, oh God, not now.

01:37.040 --> 01:38.080
It's happening again.

01:38.080 --> 01:43.840
It's happening again. They make this run for the bathroom. Babies are just like sitting,

01:43.840 --> 01:48.480
watching little Einsteins chilling, and then they're just puking on your chair,

01:48.480 --> 01:52.400
and you, and everything. And they don't really see that like bent out of shape about it.

01:52.400 --> 01:55.440
How rough and raw is baby puke? Cause they're pretty little.

01:55.440 --> 02:01.200
Is it like in Son of the Mask when I think a baby pukes one time and it like comes out

02:01.200 --> 02:04.880
real fast and hard and Jamie Kennedy is just like wearing it.

02:04.880 --> 02:09.200
It's weird because you really have to help babies out. You know, like you hear the thing about,

02:09.200 --> 02:12.400
you know, a real friend is somebody who holds your hair back while you puke.

02:12.400 --> 02:17.360
For babies, you just like upend them over the tub or something. It's like you're holding their whole

02:17.360 --> 02:22.800
body up so they could just get it all out. And then afterwards, instantly, so cool. Who's got

02:22.800 --> 02:25.600
milk? Who wants to chill? I'm so good right now.

02:25.600 --> 02:31.440
I just want to step in here and say that if somebody comes in to like my zone while I'm

02:31.440 --> 02:38.080
yard sing, that is, that is no friend of mine. My wife, my wife got real concerned about me

02:38.080 --> 02:43.520
because spoiler alert, I also had the yards this past weekend. Oh my God, in the worst way.

02:43.520 --> 02:47.360
And she like came in to check on me. I'm like, what are you, what are you doing? This is,

02:47.360 --> 02:51.440
I don't want anybody to share. It's a private thing.

02:51.440 --> 02:55.680
If it were up to me, if I, if I were, if I were yerbing real hard, I wouldn't,

02:55.680 --> 02:59.360
I would want my wife to like go outside the house, maybe like go down the block

02:59.360 --> 03:02.880
and like pretend like it never happened and she never knew it.

03:02.880 --> 03:05.840
And she came back in and I was in a tux, like drinking a martini.

03:05.840 --> 03:14.240
The next day, uh, was my actual birthday and Sydney got this thing and then Charlie evolved

03:14.240 --> 03:20.160
to stage two of this disorder in, in which she just had like tactical nuclear shits.

03:20.160 --> 03:25.200
Just like absolute abominations of poop that were not constrained by diapers.

03:25.200 --> 03:32.080
Do not try to hold these in. It's just like a, a, a dump site. And I was, there was a moment where,

03:32.080 --> 03:38.720
um, uh, is this story about to get like, it's a little rippled.

03:38.720 --> 03:41.600
Sydney ran in the bathroom to puke in that exact moment.

03:41.600 --> 03:46.320
Charlie took an Omega dump all over me and I couldn't take her into the bathroom because

03:46.320 --> 03:51.600
Sydney was in there puking. So I had to hold my shitty baby close to me as we went down the stairs.

03:51.600 --> 03:56.240
And then I just climbed into the shower with her so we could wash the excrement off of both of us.

03:56.240 --> 04:02.640
And it's just like, happy birthday to me. This is 35. This is why I can be president now

04:02.640 --> 04:06.720
because I've done this. This is, this is why I'm qualified to lead the land.

04:06.720 --> 04:13.280
You know, on my birthday, which is the same day, I, um, we put a mattress down on our foldout

04:13.280 --> 04:18.560
couch and I played oblivion all day while we watched 30 Rock and Parks and Rec on the computer.

04:18.560 --> 04:20.400
And Teresa just took a big dump on me.

04:20.400 --> 04:27.280
She took a big dump on me. And I made steaks and bacon and chicken sausages for breakfast,

04:27.280 --> 04:33.200
lunch and dinner. Oh, Jesus. It was a good day. Um, I, I just wanted to interject here before

04:33.200 --> 04:37.280
people were worried that all of us had problems. I didn't have no problems. You did great. Friday,

04:37.280 --> 04:40.960
I got the worst food poisoning I've ever had in my life. And then I think I just like took that,

04:40.960 --> 04:44.720
put a little envelope and overnighted it to my main girl, Chuck,

04:45.280 --> 04:49.600
and made sure that she sort of spread that whole thing around that whole concept.

04:49.600 --> 04:51.600
And Justin, why didn't we record yesterday?

04:52.320 --> 05:01.920
Because then it was time for part three when I, when I, I, I ate, like, I had a terrible day on

05:01.920 --> 05:07.920
my birthday and I was trying to console myself with a few slices of reheated za, uh, from my

05:07.920 --> 05:14.240
birthday party the night before. And, uh, boy, hachi-machi. Body did not like that. It woke me

05:14.240 --> 05:17.760
up at one in the morning and was like, good news. I've been saving all of the things you've consumed

05:17.760 --> 05:25.280
today for one last curtain call. Everybody, come on out. Gatorade, flat sprite, sausage,

05:25.280 --> 05:29.280
pepperoni, onion pizza. Everybody come out and take your curtain call. Come take your vow. You've

05:29.280 --> 05:34.320
earned it, kids. This is your moment to shine. By which I mean be ejected into the bathroom at

05:34.320 --> 05:39.440
terminal velocity. Um, so yeah, I did that yesterday. That was me yesterday.

05:39.440 --> 05:43.280
I just, and, and we tell all of you this and that's not to yuck you out. We're not one of

05:43.280 --> 05:49.200
those yucky podcasts that like gets off on grossome ups, but we got a lot of tweets yesterday

05:49.200 --> 05:53.680
from people were like, huh? Can't help but notice you guys skip a day. The day that fallout four

05:53.680 --> 06:00.240
comes out. I promise you my dudes. It was not that. No, I actually, I peeled myself away from

06:00.240 --> 06:06.160
fallout four to record this very episode. You're welcome. Yeah. I couldn't even play fallout four.

06:06.160 --> 06:12.400
That's how sick I was. Oh, same Z's. I was, I was curled up in bed and I was watching like crazy,

06:12.400 --> 06:16.560
crazy, crazy old. We have, we have like, we don't have cable. We have like an antenna.

06:16.560 --> 06:23.840
And for some reason that antenna, one of like 12 channels we get, um, includes his channel called

06:23.840 --> 06:29.280
buzzer. And it's all like super old, super shitty game shows. And they're really bad. And I didn't

06:29.280 --> 06:34.240
like watching them, but like, it was just nice to nice to have them there. Here's how sick I was

06:34.240 --> 06:39.440
yesterday. I got to, I had a moment yesterday where this is how sick I was. It's pretty bad

06:39.440 --> 06:45.120
while I was laying there and just like on Netflix chilling. And I thought, you know what,

06:45.120 --> 06:49.520
maybe I should check out supernatural. Like that's how sick I was. Yeah. Like that was,

06:49.520 --> 06:54.640
it was that level of sick. It's really good. Maybe I should dip into supernatural. I don't know.

06:54.640 --> 06:58.640
It's very good. I'm free now. I'm free of this disease. Now I just have a fever

06:58.640 --> 07:03.520
and can't eat anything without having Omega shits. Well, better than nothing, better than nothing. I

07:03.520 --> 07:07.360
think you're in a pretty good head space to produce some comedy. I'm I'm, I think I'm tired

07:07.360 --> 07:11.040
of hearing about our gastrointestinal distress. You know what I'm tired of hearing about? A

07:11.040 --> 07:18.240
fucking Chilean miners movie. Yes. I know. We are aware of it. We are aware of it. I know everybody

07:18.240 --> 07:23.440
has good intentions. It just tends to pile up when I get 30 tweets in one day. Like, have you

07:23.440 --> 07:30.160
seen this trailer? I don't even want to see a film about that. This is like our state of the union

07:30.160 --> 07:37.840
address. We all have really bad diarrhea and thank you all for your enthusiasm about the 33. Um,

07:37.840 --> 07:42.480
we share it in varying degrees, but we don't need minute to minute updates, text message,

07:42.480 --> 07:48.480
Amber alerts about the 33. Did y'all hear the ANTM might be coming back? Yes. Okay. That's another,

07:48.480 --> 07:51.120
yes. I just want to go ahead and get that one out there. Just get that one out there. I know

07:51.120 --> 07:55.280
ANTM might be coming back, but I'll, the proof is going to be in the pudding you guys. And the

07:55.280 --> 08:03.520
pudding is UCI. Yeah. UCI is my, UCI is my pudding. And if he's not involved with the project, let me

08:03.520 --> 08:09.120
say this, let me go out on a limb. You guys ready for a big old nuclear bomb? Yeah. Uh, for real

08:09.120 --> 08:13.680
though, fuck Tyra. You can't be like, I think it's time. I think it's time we pull the plug. Oh,

08:13.680 --> 08:17.760
is it time we pull the plug after three seasons? Yeah. Three seasons. Like it seems like a good

08:17.760 --> 08:22.080
time after letting boys in the house for a scant three seasons. Let's pull the plug. Let's got to

08:22.080 --> 08:25.680
take them off life support. Are you sure? Cause they're a baby. They were just born, but yeah,

08:25.680 --> 08:29.840
let's go ahead and take them off life support. I guess this newborn healthy baby that's like

08:29.840 --> 08:33.600
running around and jumping and doing stunts and stuff. Let's go ahead and unplug the machines and

08:33.600 --> 08:38.240
stuff from this healthy three-year-old baby. Good plan, Tyra. You can't be like that. And then be

08:38.240 --> 08:43.360
like, actually, let's see if, uh, let's see if we can get a streaming. No Tyra, you can't get

08:43.360 --> 08:48.880
a streaming. It's not your project anymore. It's UCI's project. You've lost all rights because

08:48.880 --> 08:52.800
you've lost all rights to the project. You've fucked me one too many times, Tyra. Have all

08:52.800 --> 08:58.480
your makeup back. They let boys in the house. Imagine if you let boys in the house via the

08:58.480 --> 09:03.360
process of adoption. You let boys into your house, your own house. And then after three years,

09:03.360 --> 09:08.800
you decided you would kill the boys. That's a crime. Hi. Maybe I'm just in the different America

09:08.800 --> 09:13.360
from you all. That's a crime. Yeah. It's not my America. And you certainly can't be like boys,

09:13.360 --> 09:17.680
three years, great years, lots of jumps and stunts. And I like how great you all modeled and you added

09:17.680 --> 09:23.120
a really weird and profound sexual energy to the show, to the house, I mean, but anyway,

09:23.120 --> 09:27.840
I have to kill you now. Oh wait, hold up. What's that? Hold up. What's that? Oh no, nevermind. I'm

09:27.840 --> 09:31.040
not going to kill you. I'm going to see if I can get you on streaming. I might kill you in the

09:31.040 --> 09:38.320
morning. Those boys ain't gonna look at you the same way. Let's do a question. Let's do a question.

09:38.320 --> 09:43.280
This is definitely, definitely going off the rails. The other day I was picking up my slider.

09:43.280 --> 09:48.080
Can we just not do any fucking food questions? I didn't even think about that. You can do it. This

09:48.080 --> 09:55.040
one's not about food. Okay. That was not Justin's mouth. That was a stomach flange. The other day I

09:55.040 --> 09:59.840
was picking up sliders from one of my favorite takeout places. The total was 7.99, which meant

09:59.840 --> 10:04.640
that I got a penny back to pay $8 cash for my meal. I stood there for a minute, not knowing

10:04.640 --> 10:08.720
if I should keep the penny or throw it in the tip jar on the counter. I felt like either action was

10:08.720 --> 10:14.320
cheap and chintzy, but it's one better than the other. Brothers, help me. What would you do? That's

10:14.320 --> 10:19.520
from a penny saved or a penny spurned, which is a pretty good name. I think we can all agree.

10:19.520 --> 10:22.960
I think we can all get down on that name. Where are we reading these questions from? Because I

10:22.960 --> 10:29.040
don't see them. Travis emailed us a question list. Is that how he does it usually? That's how he

10:29.040 --> 10:34.400
usually does it. For the last 275 episodes. Is it bim bam 276? Is that really what episode it is?

10:34.400 --> 10:38.320
I can't be right. Let's check the log book. Are we ready to move on? Let me check the

10:38.320 --> 10:45.840
ledger. I'm checking the ledger. Oh my God, it's 276. What are we doing? This is why people...

10:45.840 --> 10:53.360
I feel like when the magical art of sleight of hand was invented, it was for this very reason.

10:53.360 --> 10:57.920
Because neither option is correct. Neither option is appropriate. You just got to make that little

10:57.920 --> 11:03.120
copper bastard disappear. You do a little noodling over your fingers and then you

11:03.120 --> 11:07.040
just sort of wave your hands and it's gone. But in all reality, you've just thrown it very far

11:07.040 --> 11:12.560
across the restaurant to a place where you can't hear it hit the ground. This is why I've been

11:12.560 --> 11:18.880
banging this drum forever about getting rid of the fucking penny. The penny has no value.

11:18.880 --> 11:22.000
You know what I do when somebody gives me a handful of pennies? I throw them on the ground.

11:22.000 --> 11:27.280
I would have thrown them on the ground outside. It's the one monetary that is such a direct

11:27.280 --> 11:32.560
insult. If someone's like, hey, can I have some change? And you hand them a penny,

11:32.560 --> 11:36.480
you might as well just spit in the palm of their hand. And let's just put this out there

11:36.480 --> 11:42.800
and let's just grab the tiger and put him right up on the table. Pennies is just a couple letters

11:42.800 --> 11:47.600
off from penis and I hate saying it. And we all hate saying it. We shouldn't have to,

11:47.600 --> 11:53.360
I have to say peeny. See, there I go again. I have to say pennies all the time.

11:53.360 --> 11:56.080
And sometimes I say that and children laugh at me.

11:58.480 --> 12:03.280
Pennies are the absolute worst. I think what you should do is leave it on the counter

12:03.280 --> 12:07.680
and just tell them, listen, this is your cross to bear now. Do the right thing and throw this

12:07.680 --> 12:12.640
in the garbage. If enough of us did that, we would eventually run out of pennies so we could

12:12.640 --> 12:17.360
be done with this stupid currency. I think that it should be a service that they provide,

12:17.360 --> 12:20.400
right? That the cashier provides in the same way that they ask you if you want a receipt.

12:20.400 --> 12:25.280
They say, do you want a receipt? And the answer is like, no, never. Why? Why am I going to need

12:25.280 --> 12:30.400
a receipt? You're right, Griffin. I think that this is the real problem with the cashier. Why

12:30.400 --> 12:35.760
did they hand you back a penny? They gave you that chore. Well, they do that because they have to,

12:35.760 --> 12:38.640
right? Or else they get fired. No. Well, no, no, no. There's a till at the end of the day.

12:38.640 --> 12:43.840
I have to balance it out. I'm saying we need to- Yeah, but there's a dollar lenience there.

12:43.840 --> 12:48.320
We got to take this on in the Japanese style. That one doesn't really fit here, although they

12:48.320 --> 12:52.560
don't use the one yen too frequently there. But you take that penny and when they say,

12:52.560 --> 12:55.360
do you want your receipt? You say, of course not. What am I going to use that for? And then they

12:55.360 --> 13:01.120
say, and do you want your pennies, sir? And I'll say, or it should just be customary that if I say,

13:01.120 --> 13:04.960
hold the pennies and nickels, nothing smaller than a quarter, my man, then they know what's up.

13:04.960 --> 13:09.840
Because I'm not going to use anything smaller. We're all waging war against the penny. What's

13:09.840 --> 13:13.360
so fucking great about the dime? Nothing. I'll tell you what's great about the dime, Griffin.

13:13.360 --> 13:20.160
Here we go. 10 of them, very tiny, very lightweight. I like it. I don't want that. I don't want tiny,

13:20.160 --> 13:23.040
lightweight coins. I like it better than the penny. I like it better than the nickel. Well,

13:23.040 --> 13:27.840
yeah. It's 10 times better than the penny, Travis. And in many ways, I prefer it to the quarter.

13:27.840 --> 13:31.040
No, fuck off. Now you're being a- It takes up way less space.

13:31.040 --> 13:35.440
You're being obtuse. Quarters are great though. You get a quarter, you think,

13:35.440 --> 13:38.080
I'm going to do something with that. Maybe you're going to put it in a machine,

13:38.080 --> 13:40.480
get a nice gumball out for yourself. Good half.

13:40.480 --> 13:44.320
Blueberry gumball. Maybe get yourselves a nice little homey out of the machine.

13:45.760 --> 13:48.640
Get yourself a little homey. Get yourself a little sticky hand and use that sticky hand to

13:48.640 --> 13:52.240
annoy your dad on the drive home. If somebody gives you a quarter, they're basically saying,

13:52.240 --> 13:55.600
hey, this is your mad money. Just go crazy with this. Get whatever you want.

13:55.600 --> 13:58.640
Hey, you know what? You've earned this. Thanks for being you.

13:58.640 --> 14:03.040
Get yourself a psychedelic jawbreaker. Get two of these bad boys together and get yourself one

14:03.040 --> 14:07.520
of them sticky hands from one of the vending machines. And annoy your dad on the way home.

14:07.520 --> 14:11.360
Your dad's going to hate that sticky hand. I would say to the question asker,

14:11.360 --> 14:15.120
just adopt the policy of being like, I don't need the penny. Just say it.

14:15.120 --> 14:20.480
Okay, but this person can't be the only person saying this. We all have to take

14:20.480 --> 14:25.920
a stand right now and say, hold the pennies. Even saying that, you have to say pennies.

14:25.920 --> 14:29.200
And it's not right. And it's not clean. Hold the one cent piece. Hold the bit.

14:30.800 --> 14:36.080
Now, Travis, I have to take umbrage, though. You say the person should say,

14:36.080 --> 14:39.280
I don't need the penny. That's a crazy thing to say out loud.

14:39.280 --> 14:43.440
And then you pop in your monocle. The inverse of that would be like, I need the penny.

14:44.320 --> 14:48.160
Please, please don't skimp on the penny. I don't need the penny, you say loudly,

14:48.160 --> 14:50.880
so everyone can hear you and then you leave. Yeah, it's like, yeah, who does?

14:50.880 --> 14:53.280
But I do need it. Nobody needs it.

14:53.280 --> 14:58.000
We got to digitize this transaction, don't we? We got to have some sort of little terminal

14:58.000 --> 15:01.200
that after you give them your money and a little screen pops out and it's like,

15:01.200 --> 15:04.560
you want those pennies? So you don't actually have to say the words. You can just hit yes or no.

15:04.560 --> 15:07.760
Yeah, that's an equitable solution. Oh, and then they hand you an envelope

15:07.760 --> 15:10.320
and maybe it's got a penny in it. Maybe it doesn't. No one needs to know.

15:10.320 --> 15:12.080
It's like Schrodinger's penny. You know what I mean?

15:12.080 --> 15:13.200
That's nothing. You need to know if there's

15:13.200 --> 15:15.840
a penny in there or not. You've taken the inconvenience

15:15.840 --> 15:20.720
of a penny and then removed its already slight monetary value.

15:20.720 --> 15:25.840
And the value of the penny has to be exceeded by the value of the envelope, right?

15:25.840 --> 15:27.440
Yeah, but why? Oh, very much so.

15:27.440 --> 15:30.960
They're going to go out of business. Too sweet. It's a profit deal. I get it.

15:30.960 --> 15:34.320
Japanese style. Let's get it done. Can I do a Yahoo?

15:34.320 --> 15:36.480
You're kind of like stepping all over me a little bit.

15:36.480 --> 15:39.600
Well, do we? Okay. Well, sorry. You know, we do one on one.

15:40.400 --> 15:42.480
No, we don't always. Most of the time.

15:42.480 --> 15:45.440
This Yahoo was sent in by level 9000 Yajru Drew at Drew Davenport.

15:45.440 --> 15:49.680
Thank you, Drew Davenport. It's by Yajru Answers user Joshua Leal.

15:49.680 --> 15:52.480
Putting his whole name out there and I've hacked him.

15:52.480 --> 15:56.880
I'm in. I'm into Joshua. Oh, I've got all his files.

15:56.880 --> 15:59.280
He's a dirty boy. Living the Josh life.

15:59.840 --> 16:03.040
Just kidding. It's mostly JPEGs of his trip to...

16:04.160 --> 16:05.120
Boca Raton.

16:05.120 --> 16:06.960
Boca Raton. Ooh, yeah.

16:07.920 --> 16:11.440
Found one of his butt in some swimming trunks.

16:13.840 --> 16:15.120
Putting this on Tumblr.

16:16.480 --> 16:18.720
Thank you, Joshua, for your files.

16:20.400 --> 16:23.520
Thanks for your files, Josh.

16:23.520 --> 16:24.560
Joshua asks...

16:25.200 --> 16:26.480
Why are people looking at my butt?

16:27.440 --> 16:30.400
It's not a nude butt picture. It's just like some nice trunks.

16:30.400 --> 16:31.440
Joshua...

16:31.440 --> 16:34.080
My trunks picked a butt Tumblr. I gotta know.

16:34.080 --> 16:34.640
So...

16:34.640 --> 16:35.680
Joshua asks...

16:38.160 --> 16:41.760
Can you bring board games such as Monopoly onto an airplane?

16:44.160 --> 16:44.960
Huh.

16:44.960 --> 16:48.080
Can you bring board games such as Monopoly onto an airplane?

16:48.080 --> 16:50.000
I don't think he doesn't specify,

16:50.000 --> 16:53.200
and so I don't think he's talking about travel-sized board games.

16:53.200 --> 16:54.720
Let's assume not.

16:54.720 --> 16:57.120
No, because that would be not funny.

16:58.560 --> 16:59.520
Can you bring...

16:59.520 --> 17:00.800
Excuse me, excuse me.

17:00.800 --> 17:02.880
Oh, this is my carry-on.

17:02.880 --> 17:04.720
It's the board game Monopoly.

17:05.520 --> 17:06.640
On one condition.

17:08.000 --> 17:08.720
Which is?

17:08.720 --> 17:10.000
If you are traveling alone.

17:11.120 --> 17:11.920
Well, that's...

17:11.920 --> 17:13.280
Who wants to get in on this?

17:14.000 --> 17:14.800
Come on, folks.

17:16.240 --> 17:19.520
I need at least three other players for it to be fun.

17:20.080 --> 17:21.760
Row 18, I know you feel me.

17:22.480 --> 17:23.920
I'll let one of you guys be the top hat.

17:27.520 --> 17:30.160
That would be a little bit cumbersome, I think.

17:30.160 --> 17:31.840
Also, it would be a race against time.

17:31.840 --> 17:33.280
Monopoly's not a great example, I feel like,

17:33.280 --> 17:36.240
because no game in Monopoly has lasted shorter than like six hours.

17:36.240 --> 17:38.880
Yeah, it's good for international flights, though.

17:38.880 --> 17:39.680
It is.

17:39.680 --> 17:41.360
I think one sweet thing would be

17:41.360 --> 17:45.680
is if you get one of the flight attendants into the game

17:45.680 --> 17:48.320
so that you have to ring your buzzer every few minutes

17:48.320 --> 17:49.680
and bring it back to your chair like,

17:49.680 --> 17:53.360
hey, listen, I don't need a warm towel or a fresh coffee.

17:53.360 --> 17:56.000
I just need you to go ahead and take your turn.

17:56.000 --> 17:56.720
Take your turn.

17:57.440 --> 17:59.120
Roll them bones.

17:59.120 --> 18:00.000
That's the ballroom.

18:00.000 --> 18:00.800
It's not the ballroom.

18:00.800 --> 18:02.000
It's not the ballroom.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.120
Well, wait, what am I doing?

18:03.120 --> 18:03.760
This is Clue.

18:03.760 --> 18:05.120
I'm not supposed to tell you that.

18:05.120 --> 18:07.120
You know what game would work really well on the plane?

18:07.120 --> 18:08.400
Connect Four.

18:08.400 --> 18:09.840
Connect Four would be great, Travis.

18:09.840 --> 18:11.840
Yes, great travel game recommendations

18:11.840 --> 18:13.120
from my brother, my brother, and me.

18:13.120 --> 18:13.520
You heard it here first.

18:13.520 --> 18:14.800
It's very vertical.

18:14.800 --> 18:15.760
It's vertical.

18:15.760 --> 18:18.480
It doesn't take up as much room on your tray.

18:18.480 --> 18:21.920
Those pieces aren't going damn anywhere, are they?

18:21.920 --> 18:22.800
They're gonna stay locked.

18:22.800 --> 18:25.280
It's like a little Czechish prison, isn't it?

18:25.280 --> 18:27.120
Imagine if you were playing like chess

18:27.120 --> 18:29.760
and the person in front of you leaned their chair back

18:29.760 --> 18:31.600
and ruined the whole game.

18:31.600 --> 18:32.720
Yeah, that's done.

18:32.720 --> 18:34.640
That's not gonna happen in Connect Four.

18:34.640 --> 18:38.000
My recommendation would be the hit game Don't Wake Daddy

18:38.000 --> 18:40.160
because there's nothing that would bring me more joy

18:40.160 --> 18:42.480
than to be on an airplane and frequently exclaiming,

18:42.480 --> 18:44.320
hey, don't wake daddy.

18:44.320 --> 18:46.320
Everybody keep it down or you're gonna wake daddy.

18:46.320 --> 18:47.280
Don't wake daddy.

18:47.280 --> 18:50.400
Maybe we could play Grape Escape or Crackers in the Bed.

18:50.960 --> 18:52.320
What's crackers in the bed?

18:52.320 --> 18:54.880
I think it's the one where you eat crackers in a fake bed.

18:55.440 --> 18:56.960
All I remember is the title, Frank.

18:56.960 --> 18:58.560
That sounds like a sick game.

18:58.560 --> 19:00.240
Knock, knock, knock.

19:00.240 --> 19:02.000
Hi, are you the captain of the flight?

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
Yes, I guess I'm the captain.

19:04.000 --> 19:04.800
How can I help you?

19:04.800 --> 19:05.600
How did you get in here?

19:05.600 --> 19:06.880
That's not important right now.

19:06.880 --> 19:11.120
Could you please try to keep the flight turbulence free

19:11.120 --> 19:14.560
as you have repeatedly knocked over both the chandelier

19:14.560 --> 19:17.360
and the fireplace trap on my copy of 13 Dead End Drive?

19:17.360 --> 19:17.680
Jesus.

19:17.680 --> 19:19.600
And we're trying to enjoy a game

19:19.600 --> 19:20.880
of 13 Dead End Drive right here

19:20.880 --> 19:23.200
and your turbulence is making it nigh impossible.

19:23.200 --> 19:25.680
Me and my nephew are trying to play stack-em-ups.

19:25.680 --> 19:26.960
What is stack-em-ups?

19:26.960 --> 19:28.800
It's like when you go to Target to buy Jenga

19:28.800 --> 19:31.360
but they don't have Jenga so you buy stack-em-ups instead.

19:31.360 --> 19:33.200
And there's like animal faces on the box.

19:33.200 --> 19:35.840
Animal faces on the box but on the underside of the box

19:35.840 --> 19:38.480
there's sex suggestions.

19:38.480 --> 19:39.760
Are you playing this with your nephew?

19:39.760 --> 19:42.400
Yeah, we're just, we're not, you're ignoring the sex suggestions.

19:42.400 --> 19:43.840
They didn't have Jenga, okay?

19:47.680 --> 19:50.160
Maybe you bring on a copy of Operation

19:50.160 --> 19:52.320
and just have like sunglasses so people know,

19:52.320 --> 19:53.920
yeah, you're that kind of guy.

19:53.920 --> 19:56.640
You can play Operation on a flight, no problem.

19:56.640 --> 19:58.080
Added level difficulty.

19:58.080 --> 19:59.440
No scope that liver.

19:59.440 --> 20:00.800
Reach right in there, pop it out.

20:00.800 --> 20:02.160
It doesn't matter how much the plane shakes.

20:02.160 --> 20:03.760
Your hands are rock steady.

20:03.760 --> 20:06.640
You do it staring wistfully out the window.

20:06.640 --> 20:08.400
Yeah, you don't even need to pay attention.

20:08.400 --> 20:10.000
That's how good you are at Operation.

20:11.040 --> 20:13.760
I'm flying to Hong Kong on Saturday

20:13.760 --> 20:17.040
and that flight is 16 hours.

20:17.840 --> 20:21.360
Which I'm just gonna round up to a day.

20:21.360 --> 20:22.400
Yeah, 100.

20:22.400 --> 20:26.880
I'm gonna have a sky day with the air people

20:26.880 --> 20:31.600
and I guess should I bring the Game of Life on board?

20:31.600 --> 20:33.440
I hadn't even considered it as a possibility

20:33.440 --> 20:36.560
but I figure if I'm gonna be on a day on a plane,

20:36.560 --> 20:37.600
if it's one of those day planes

20:37.600 --> 20:39.280
that they're gonna give you lots of room

20:39.280 --> 20:42.480
to spread out and do whatever, play board games.

20:42.480 --> 20:44.640
Are you doing that Air Emirates?

20:44.640 --> 20:47.600
Because they give you a shower and stuff in that one.

20:48.240 --> 20:50.720
No, that would be very sick if that's true.

20:50.720 --> 20:54.480
But I think I'm just doing like American Airlines

20:54.480 --> 20:57.360
or Hong Kong Great Flights.

20:57.360 --> 20:58.880
No shower in that one.

20:58.880 --> 21:00.320
Just a communal bathtub.

21:01.200 --> 21:02.000
That's fine too.

21:02.720 --> 21:08.400
I can bring my floaties and balance a copy of Risk on it

21:08.400 --> 21:09.360
or something.

21:09.360 --> 21:11.040
Don't you think it's about time

21:11.040 --> 21:15.360
that we stormed into the offices of Milton Bradley

21:15.360 --> 21:18.240
and Hasbro and told them,

21:18.240 --> 21:22.400
hey, just because you've been making this beat-ass board game

21:22.400 --> 21:26.080
for a hundred years doesn't mean you need to keep making it

21:26.080 --> 21:27.360
because it sucks.

21:27.360 --> 21:28.640
Are we talking about Monopoly here?

21:28.640 --> 21:30.800
I'm talking about Game of Life sucks.

21:30.800 --> 21:34.720
Candy Land, not even a fucking game, it sucks.

21:34.720 --> 21:35.440
Yeah.

21:35.440 --> 21:38.240
Battleship, that game is horse shit.

21:38.240 --> 21:40.400
Yeah, that game's not very good.

21:40.400 --> 21:42.720
Candy Land especially, it sucks.

21:42.720 --> 21:43.920
It's not a game.

21:43.920 --> 21:45.280
Fucking crackers in the bed.

21:45.280 --> 21:48.240
No, hey, hardcore gamers agree.

21:48.240 --> 21:49.600
Crackers in the bed is better than real.

21:49.600 --> 21:52.400
Yeah, but you have to keep buying crackers.

21:52.400 --> 21:54.160
Yeah, well, you gotta get the expansions.

21:54.960 --> 21:56.160
No, they're not expansions, Travis.

21:56.160 --> 21:57.920
You gotta get soda crackers.

21:57.920 --> 22:00.560
You gotta get Ritz crackers, the Saltines.

22:00.560 --> 22:03.200
The Saltines expansion, it's rare.

22:03.200 --> 22:06.560
You're just describing crackers that you buy at a store.

22:07.920 --> 22:10.160
Yeah, at a grocery game store.

22:11.040 --> 22:12.640
No, just like it's a grocery store.

22:12.640 --> 22:16.400
And you can play it with Grape Escape.

22:16.400 --> 22:18.400
I guess you could play Grape Escape with real grapes,

22:18.400 --> 22:19.040
couldn't you?

22:19.040 --> 22:22.160
Once, and then your board's all soggy and sticky and ruined.

22:22.160 --> 22:23.920
You could play Mousetrap with real mice.

22:24.560 --> 22:26.880
Yeah, sure, you play Operation with a real guy.

22:28.400 --> 22:28.880
No way.

22:29.840 --> 22:30.880
No, go for it.

22:30.880 --> 22:33.680
As long as we're saying dumb shit, cut him in.

22:33.680 --> 22:35.120
Just start cutting on a man.

22:36.240 --> 22:37.600
Just say whatever dumb shit you want.

22:37.600 --> 22:42.960
Make them, take them to the factory, mash them, smash them.

22:42.960 --> 22:43.920
Now they're history.

22:44.480 --> 22:46.000
Justin knows the Grape Escape theme song,

22:46.000 --> 22:47.040
so now that's in the show.

22:47.040 --> 22:48.880
Anybody else have anything that they know?

22:48.880 --> 22:50.240
Anybody else have any things they know

22:50.240 --> 22:52.400
that they just gonna put in our show forever?

22:55.520 --> 22:56.960
I just don't want to lose it, you know?

22:58.080 --> 22:59.760
Have we tapped the whole board game thing?

23:01.600 --> 23:03.680
We've preserved it in digital amber.

23:03.680 --> 23:06.880
Okay, well, scientists in the future.

23:06.880 --> 23:10.320
Let me say, does anybody else know any board games

23:10.320 --> 23:13.440
that they can just say, no need for a joke,

23:13.440 --> 23:15.200
as we've already proven many times over

23:15.200 --> 23:16.320
in the past five minutes.

23:16.320 --> 23:19.120
Just board games that you'd like to say out loud.

23:19.120 --> 23:20.080
Hero Quest.

23:20.800 --> 23:23.920
Yes, and that's the only one.

23:23.920 --> 23:24.960
Let's move on.

23:24.960 --> 23:26.560
All right, here's another question.

23:26.560 --> 23:30.640
It comes in to us from a listener of our show.

23:30.640 --> 23:32.560
If you'd like to send in one, you can send it to

23:32.560 --> 23:36.400
mbmbam at maximumfun.org.

23:36.400 --> 23:37.200
Here's the question.

23:37.760 --> 23:39.040
God, I feel like shit.

23:40.080 --> 23:40.580
Woof.

23:42.240 --> 23:42.800
Yeah.

23:42.800 --> 23:43.840
Shake them off.

23:43.840 --> 23:44.880
Shake it off.

23:44.880 --> 23:47.200
My husband and I are from different parts of the country.

23:47.200 --> 23:48.480
Him, Midwest.

23:48.480 --> 23:49.920
Me, Southeast.

23:49.920 --> 23:51.280
And I find some of their food.

23:51.280 --> 23:52.400
We're at war.

23:52.400 --> 23:54.960
Yeah, I find some of their food nasty.

23:55.680 --> 23:56.400
The Midwest.

23:57.920 --> 23:58.400
Excuse me?

23:58.400 --> 24:01.200
Some of my in-laws come to see us for a holiday meal

24:01.200 --> 24:02.880
and I'm wondering, am I supposed to make some

24:02.880 --> 24:05.040
of their traditional stuff, even though it's gross?

24:05.040 --> 24:08.320
Or since they're in my house, is this a you-get-what-you-get

24:08.320 --> 24:08.960
situation?

24:08.960 --> 24:12.160
That's from Steamed vs. Fried in Tennessee.

24:12.160 --> 24:14.560
How could you ask this question and not send some, like,

24:15.120 --> 24:17.600
concrete examples?

24:19.600 --> 24:20.100
Yes?

24:20.960 --> 24:21.920
I don't know what you're talking about.

24:21.920 --> 24:23.600
Are you talking about, like, a deep dish za?

24:24.960 --> 24:26.800
You talking about that Cincinnati chili?

24:26.800 --> 24:27.520
What are you talking about?

24:27.520 --> 24:29.520
No, never make Cincinnati chili, ever.

24:29.520 --> 24:31.040
It's an abomination.

24:31.040 --> 24:33.600
Are they talking, like, maybe, like,

24:33.600 --> 24:36.080
like, potato salad?

24:36.080 --> 24:37.600
Like, what is the Midwest have?

24:37.600 --> 24:40.480
Maybe, maybe it's something like, um, you know,

24:40.480 --> 24:42.640
your sweet potato casserole with the multicolored

24:42.640 --> 24:43.760
marshmallows on top.

24:44.480 --> 24:46.400
I don't have anything against that, mind you,

24:46.400 --> 24:49.680
but I can see where that might be off-putting to outsiders.

24:50.320 --> 24:50.880
What the fuck?

24:50.880 --> 24:52.240
Can I, can I ask a question?

24:52.240 --> 24:55.360
What the fuck is so great about Southeast food?

24:55.360 --> 24:58.000
What do you got, what do you got crackle-ackin' in Florida?

24:58.000 --> 24:58.960
Oranges?

24:58.960 --> 25:00.000
Is that all you subsist on?

25:00.000 --> 25:01.280
Chocodiles?

25:01.280 --> 25:03.680
Chocodiles and oranges, is that it?

25:03.680 --> 25:04.880
Key lime pie?

25:04.880 --> 25:05.520
Key lime pie?

25:05.520 --> 25:06.480
That's not a healthy diet.

25:06.480 --> 25:08.400
You've just named three sweet things.

25:08.400 --> 25:09.840
I don't know what's in the mid-

25:09.840 --> 25:11.680
Like, can we clarify this for me?

25:11.680 --> 25:12.720
What is the Midwest?

25:13.360 --> 25:15.840
I think the Midwest is everything that's not New York,

25:15.840 --> 25:17.280
California, and Florida.

25:17.280 --> 25:18.080
Okay, got it.

25:18.080 --> 25:19.280
Now, what's the Southeast?

25:19.280 --> 25:21.440
Just Winston, Salem, and surrounding areas, right?

25:21.440 --> 25:22.560
Okay, that can't be right.

25:23.440 --> 25:24.960
Texas is like the South-South.

25:24.960 --> 25:25.760
Incorrect.

25:25.760 --> 25:27.280
I, I think here's what you have to do.

25:27.280 --> 25:28.240
I think you need to

25:28.240 --> 25:31.600
to check in with your husband's family.

25:31.600 --> 25:33.440
So let's, let's put this in context

25:33.440 --> 25:34.720
and say it's like Thanksgiving, right?

25:35.760 --> 25:38.560
Talk to your husband or to your in-laws and say,

25:38.560 --> 25:42.160
what are like three dishes that if you don't have

25:42.160 --> 25:44.560
will feel like an incomplete Thanksgiving?

25:44.560 --> 25:46.480
I don't think you need to like recreate

25:46.480 --> 25:48.560
their Thanksgiving whole cloth.

25:48.560 --> 25:50.320
I think that you just have to say like,

25:50.320 --> 25:52.800
you know, maybe like they always have green bean casserole

25:52.800 --> 25:54.320
and if there's no green bean casserole,

25:54.320 --> 25:56.240
it just doesn't feel like Thanksgiving?

25:56.240 --> 25:57.520
Well, in that case, yes,

25:57.520 --> 25:59.520
you should have green bean casserole.

25:59.520 --> 26:02.240
When my in-laws came in town for Thanksgiving last year

26:02.240 --> 26:04.480
and Rachel and I cooked for them,

26:04.480 --> 26:08.320
I was like, welcome to, welcome to my house.

26:08.320 --> 26:10.240
Welcome to Aaron's party.

26:10.240 --> 26:13.280
And I did, I did them, I did them what I wanted

26:13.280 --> 26:16.880
and then they liked it all very much because I was right.

26:16.880 --> 26:19.520
Like the food I like is just right.

26:19.520 --> 26:21.680
There is a, there is a distinction here, I think,

26:21.680 --> 26:26.400
between like, you can get away with, at holiday time,

26:26.400 --> 26:30.800
I think a lot of people can get away with like bad food

26:30.800 --> 26:34.320
that they traditionally eat around this time of year

26:34.320 --> 26:37.120
and it is appropriate and okay.

26:37.120 --> 26:40.400
Like I would say if you just make good food

26:40.400 --> 26:42.080
that tastes very good,

26:42.080 --> 26:43.760
I don't think anybody's gonna grouse.

26:43.760 --> 26:46.080
Like maybe you do wanna throw in a couple of their favorites

26:46.080 --> 26:48.880
just as like pay homage and tribute.

26:48.880 --> 26:49.840
You don't have to eat them.

26:49.840 --> 26:53.680
But serve them, serve them in like a grody plastic cup.

26:53.680 --> 26:56.720
Just so they- Like a dog bowl.

26:56.720 --> 26:59.200
Yeah, just, no, not that blatant,

26:59.200 --> 27:01.360
but like a fucking- Solo cup.

27:01.360 --> 27:04.400
Like a men in black two commemorative plastic cup

27:04.400 --> 27:05.520
you got from Burger King.

27:07.280 --> 27:08.800
Also, listen, there's so,

27:08.800 --> 27:10.800
like the internet is such a great resource

27:10.800 --> 27:14.560
to find a recipe that you like for a dish that they like

27:15.200 --> 27:17.280
where you can be like, oh, here's an iteration of it

27:17.280 --> 27:18.960
that doesn't sound disgusting to me.

27:18.960 --> 27:23.200
So I'll make this version of, you know, potatoes au gratin

27:23.200 --> 27:25.840
that they'll like because it's that,

27:25.840 --> 27:28.400
but I like it because the ingredients sound good to me.

27:28.400 --> 27:31.280
There are things like, I'll give you guys an example.

27:31.280 --> 27:34.400
Around every Thanksgiving, not around,

27:34.400 --> 27:38.960
on every Thanksgiving, I forced- Somewhere near it.

27:38.960 --> 27:42.560
I forced Sydney to make my mom's sweet potato casserole.

27:42.560 --> 27:44.240
Because it's the best.

27:44.240 --> 27:46.240
Okay, it is the best, it is amazing, right?

27:46.240 --> 27:49.200
Okay, let me just pump the brakes here for a second, guys.

27:49.200 --> 27:53.520
Guys, do you eat this casserole any other day of the year?

27:53.520 --> 27:54.320
No.

27:54.320 --> 27:56.320
Well, I mean, the following Friday and Saturday.

27:56.320 --> 27:57.840
Yeah, Friday and Saturday, it's like dope.

27:57.840 --> 27:59.200
You reheated it, it's dope.

27:59.200 --> 28:02.240
We'll post the recipe for our mom's sweet potato casserole

28:02.240 --> 28:04.880
on the, somewhere, on the Facebook maybe.

28:04.880 --> 28:08.080
But anyway, we don't eat it any other time of year, right?

28:08.080 --> 28:10.160
Why is that, do you think?

28:10.160 --> 28:12.000
Like, I really like it.

28:12.000 --> 28:13.520
I never think to myself, I'm gonna eat this.

28:13.520 --> 28:15.760
I have to assume it's because it's like a special occasion.

28:15.760 --> 28:20.000
I like, I don't have birthday cake on random Wednesdays.

28:20.000 --> 28:23.520
I guess, yeah, but like, if you really liked it,

28:23.520 --> 28:26.640
why wouldn't you want it to eat at other times of the year?

28:26.640 --> 28:31.120
Well, it's only because if it's the middle of June,

28:31.120 --> 28:34.240
or even late June, and someone sees you eating

28:34.240 --> 28:39.840
a Christmas ham, you'll be asked to leave the town

28:39.840 --> 28:40.960
that you're in.

28:40.960 --> 28:42.960
You'll be literally run out of town.

28:42.960 --> 28:44.640
That's in the Old Town Charter.

28:44.640 --> 28:46.640
Yeah, no Christmas hams in June.

28:46.640 --> 28:49.360
You know, it's a little bit of that special occasion thing.

28:49.360 --> 28:49.920
But you know what?

28:49.920 --> 28:51.600
Also, I will say this question, Asger.

28:52.320 --> 28:54.960
When you get married, and like, there starts to be

28:54.960 --> 28:57.760
that like mixing of like family traditions and stuff,

28:57.760 --> 29:00.080
it's all about like, what's our holiday now?

29:00.080 --> 29:01.680
Like, what's our event going to be?

29:01.680 --> 29:04.400
Not what was it when you were 13, but what is it now

29:04.400 --> 29:06.480
that we're forming our own family?

29:06.480 --> 29:07.280
You know what I mean?

29:07.280 --> 29:09.840
And so this is a great time, especially if you're hosting it

29:09.840 --> 29:13.520
for the first time, to maybe try out some new stuff,

29:13.520 --> 29:16.400
and maybe be like, this is a thing we're gonna have

29:16.400 --> 29:17.840
every year now, if you like it.

29:17.840 --> 29:20.400
If you don't like it, we never have it again,

29:20.400 --> 29:22.720
because it's very flexible and valuable,

29:22.720 --> 29:23.920
and we can do whatever we want.

29:23.920 --> 29:26.640
That's fine and all, but the first time their in-laws

29:26.640 --> 29:29.680
come in town, it's like, where's the creamy ham salad?

29:29.680 --> 29:32.080
And you're like, oh no, no, we're doing our own thing.

29:32.640 --> 29:34.560
You'll be asked to leave the town.

29:35.600 --> 29:39.040
Because you've disappointed your in-laws so desperately.

29:40.560 --> 29:41.520
And then you have to move.

29:41.520 --> 29:43.280
You gotta make that creamy ham salad.

29:43.280 --> 29:44.080
Here's the recipe.

29:44.640 --> 29:47.280
You gotta go out there and you gotta get sour cream.

29:47.280 --> 29:48.720
The good stuff.

29:48.720 --> 29:50.480
No wait, the bad stuff.

29:50.480 --> 29:53.040
The cheapest, grossest sour cream you can find.

29:53.040 --> 29:56.080
I'm talking about 14 ounces of standing water

29:56.080 --> 29:58.640
on top of this piece of shit when you open the tub.

29:58.640 --> 30:00.480
And then you're gonna wanna get some ham.

30:00.480 --> 30:03.360
Again, this time actually you wanna splurge a little bit.

30:03.360 --> 30:06.000
Mix them all up, throw in a little bit of leaves,

30:06.000 --> 30:07.760
up to you which kind, my man,

30:07.760 --> 30:10.480
and then put it right there on the table,

30:10.480 --> 30:13.680
and serve it with chopsticks in the traditional eating style.

30:13.680 --> 30:16.560
Sydney's grandmother makes this thing

30:17.360 --> 30:20.240
every Christmas Eve called frozen salad.

30:21.520 --> 30:24.640
And I hate it if I don't like to eat it with my mouth,

30:24.640 --> 30:27.600
but if it wasn't there, but every year I'm like,

30:27.600 --> 30:28.960
hell yeah, there it is.

30:28.960 --> 30:30.000
What's up, y'all?

30:30.000 --> 30:30.640
What's up, y'all?

30:30.640 --> 30:32.320
I feel comforted by its presence.

30:32.320 --> 30:33.440
What's up, y'all son of a bitch?

30:33.440 --> 30:34.880
Of course I'm gonna get a slice of you.

30:34.880 --> 30:37.360
Frozen salad, you cold son of a bitch?

30:37.360 --> 30:38.000
Get in here.

30:38.000 --> 30:42.240
Just like a one sentence description of frozen salad.

30:42.240 --> 30:44.080
No, no, no, no, I'm actually gonna demand

30:44.080 --> 30:46.960
that you do not tell us what frozen salad is

30:46.960 --> 30:48.320
because you just said the words,

30:48.320 --> 30:50.000
let me have a slice of salad,

30:50.000 --> 30:53.840
and science PSA from your old buddy Professor Griffin,

30:53.840 --> 30:56.240
salad should not be served in slice form.

30:57.840 --> 30:59.200
Frozen salad, you see.

31:01.200 --> 31:04.000
Let's go to the money's up.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.560
Gmod Jody, if you're listening, I'm into frozen salad.

31:06.560 --> 31:08.320
Gmod Jody, really looking forward to it.

31:08.320 --> 31:10.000
Highlight of the holidays.

31:10.000 --> 31:11.920
You're gonna crush it this time, I feel it.

31:12.960 --> 31:15.520
Let's go to the money's up.

31:15.520 --> 31:27.680
Let's go to the money's up.

31:27.680 --> 31:31.120
My Brother, My Brother, Me is supported in part by harrys.com.

31:31.120 --> 31:32.480
You guys doing Movember?

31:32.480 --> 31:36.960
I mean, I've got a full beard all the time.

31:36.960 --> 31:41.200
I've already shaved, it looks bad, dirty face.

31:41.200 --> 31:44.480
I'm gonna donate to Movember, I did Movember once

31:44.480 --> 31:47.680
and it was the year that I met my,

31:47.680 --> 31:49.040
it was actually over Thanksgiving,

31:49.040 --> 31:52.000
it was Thanksgiving, I met my in-laws

31:52.000 --> 31:54.640
and my father-in-law has this amazing mustache

31:54.640 --> 31:57.120
and I was afraid that he thought I was making fun of him

31:57.120 --> 32:00.160
with my really bad mustache, I wasn't.

32:00.160 --> 32:02.480
That is a long con to make fun of someone.

32:02.480 --> 32:04.720
I grew a mustache for three weeks, get it?

32:04.720 --> 32:06.320
I grew a parody mustache.

32:06.320 --> 32:08.640
But we were just meeting and it could have been

32:08.640 --> 32:09.520
a power move, I don't know.

32:11.440 --> 32:15.120
Anyway, the official partner of the Movember Foundation

32:15.120 --> 32:17.360
is Harry's and they're gonna be donating money

32:17.360 --> 32:19.600
to help raise awareness for men's health.

32:19.600 --> 32:23.600
Harry's starter set is $15 and it includes a razor,

32:23.600 --> 32:26.560
foaming shave gel or shave cream and three razor blades

32:26.560 --> 32:28.320
plus free shipping.

32:28.320 --> 32:32.080
You can go to harrys.com for the $5 off the starter set

32:32.080 --> 32:34.480
with the code MYBROTHER, all one word.

32:34.480 --> 32:37.040
You take that $15, you're gonna cut a third off of it

32:37.040 --> 32:38.960
for just 10 bucks.

32:38.960 --> 32:41.920
You can get the razor, the foaming shave gel and three blades.

32:41.920 --> 32:44.560
Start shaving better today, you are really going to enjoy

32:44.560 --> 32:48.000
the Harry's shaving experience, I can guarantee you of that.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.240
And men, don't forget to get your prostate checked.

32:50.880 --> 32:52.240
While we're at it.

32:52.240 --> 32:54.000
While we're at it, get up in there.

32:54.000 --> 32:56.160
There's no, it's never too early.

32:56.160 --> 32:57.920
Get your walnut checked out.

32:57.920 --> 32:59.840
Scope that nut.

32:59.840 --> 33:00.960
You wear underwear every day?

33:02.000 --> 33:02.800
Sometimes. Mostly?

33:03.760 --> 33:06.080
Mianis understands that and that's why they're dedicated

33:06.880 --> 33:10.000
to creating the world's most comfortable underwear.

33:10.000 --> 33:12.640
Well, I want them to sell me on the concept

33:12.640 --> 33:14.240
of even wearing the stuff.

33:14.240 --> 33:15.440
It's just like double pants.

33:18.400 --> 33:20.000
Yesterday I did not wear underwear,

33:20.000 --> 33:21.360
it would have just been an impediment.

33:22.000 --> 33:22.500
Yeah.

33:24.640 --> 33:26.880
You wore your long johns with the flap on the butt.

33:26.880 --> 33:29.600
Yeah, my supernatural pants, I call them.

33:29.600 --> 33:32.480
And a dog, a dog ran into the house

33:32.480 --> 33:35.680
and tore off the butt part of your supernatural pants.

33:35.680 --> 33:38.240
And damn if he didn't steal my roast beef.

33:38.240 --> 33:43.200
I spent all weekend making that damn mutt.

33:44.080 --> 33:45.040
Get him out of here.

33:45.040 --> 33:45.540
Muffins?

33:47.200 --> 33:49.760
Tore my vest long johns, stole my roast beef.

33:51.520 --> 33:52.720
Had to put him down.

33:52.720 --> 33:53.840
Hate that dog.

33:53.840 --> 33:57.200
What am I supposed to snack on during my binge sessions

33:57.200 --> 33:58.880
of the supernatural?

33:58.880 --> 34:00.960
What am I supposed to even wear?

34:05.440 --> 34:08.000
If you need something to wear underneath your best long johns,

34:08.000 --> 34:10.320
Mianis has tons of colors and styles.

34:10.320 --> 34:12.080
And it's the only place to get matching pairs

34:12.080 --> 34:13.520
for men and women.

34:13.520 --> 34:14.960
Plus we all know paying for shipping sucks.

34:14.960 --> 34:16.880
So Mianis has removed that from the equation.

34:16.880 --> 34:20.880
All orders to the US and Canada ship for free.

34:20.880 --> 34:22.160
Now to sweeten the deal,

34:22.160 --> 34:25.680
Mianis is offering you 20% off your first order

34:25.680 --> 34:29.040
at mianis.com slash my brother.

34:29.040 --> 34:32.720
That's M-E-N-D-I-S.com slash my brother.

34:33.680 --> 34:34.960
I got a message here.

34:34.960 --> 34:35.600
Can I read it?

34:36.160 --> 34:36.480
Yes.

34:37.760 --> 34:40.480
It's from Sarah, AKA Chuggs.

34:41.920 --> 34:44.720
That's C-H Chuggs.

34:45.920 --> 34:47.120
And it's to Derek.

34:47.120 --> 34:49.600
And Chuggs says to Derek,

34:49.600 --> 34:52.400
thanks for being the best friend a girl could ever ask for.

34:52.400 --> 34:54.000
Between doing incredibly sweet things

34:54.000 --> 34:56.160
like cooking me gourmet meals while I relax

34:56.160 --> 34:57.600
and listen to my bim bam

34:57.600 --> 34:59.600
and tolerating my insane family,

34:59.600 --> 35:01.120
you're pretty much perfect.

35:01.120 --> 35:02.720
Here's to having the best summer ever.

35:03.680 --> 35:04.720
2016, I hope.

35:05.360 --> 35:07.120
Hootie hoo, big D.

35:07.120 --> 35:07.760
Hootie hoo.

35:08.880 --> 35:10.080
Hootie hoo indeed.

35:11.360 --> 35:13.440
I feel like the inflection on that is like,

35:13.440 --> 35:14.400
because of the repetition,

35:14.400 --> 35:16.640
it's a little more somber and purposeful.

35:16.640 --> 35:20.000
Like, hootie hoo, big D, hootie hoo.

35:20.000 --> 35:20.560
Hootie hoo.

35:21.280 --> 35:23.280
Is that like what Carla said on Top Chef?

35:24.720 --> 35:25.040
What?

35:26.320 --> 35:27.360
Carla on Top Chef?

35:30.160 --> 35:31.040
This next message.

35:31.040 --> 35:32.400
Carla on Top Chef had this thing-

35:32.400 --> 35:34.000
Griffin, can you say, uh,

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
Carla on Top Chef one more time?

35:36.000 --> 35:36.240
Yeah.

35:36.240 --> 35:36.960
I'm pretty-

35:36.960 --> 35:38.000
Just to be clear,

35:38.640 --> 35:42.240
pretty sure they're referencing the Outkast tune,

35:42.240 --> 35:42.800
Hootie Hoo.

35:43.360 --> 35:46.480
Oh, it could be what Carla said in Top Chef,

35:46.480 --> 35:48.080
because she had a system worked out

35:48.080 --> 35:50.000
where if she ever got separated from her husband

35:50.000 --> 35:51.040
in a grocery store,

35:51.040 --> 35:52.560
she would just go, hootie hoo.

35:52.560 --> 35:54.160
And then he would yell, hootie hoo.

35:54.160 --> 35:55.760
And they would find each other like that.

35:55.760 --> 35:58.240
Like, like married echolocation.

35:58.240 --> 35:59.440
I really like that.

35:59.440 --> 36:01.120
Just food for thought, ponder on it.

36:01.120 --> 36:02.720
Think about your own catchphrases

36:02.720 --> 36:04.640
that you can use to find your lost husband

36:04.640 --> 36:05.440
in a grocery store.

36:06.000 --> 36:07.840
This next message is for the McElroy-

36:07.840 --> 36:08.400
or sorry.

36:08.400 --> 36:10.720
This next message is for the brothers McElroy.

36:10.720 --> 36:13.520
It is from Lieutenant Randolph and Dr. Claw.

36:14.240 --> 36:16.400
Happy birthday to the three brothers McElroy.

36:16.400 --> 36:16.720
Nice, nice.

36:16.720 --> 36:18.960
Since this day has so much fanfare,

36:18.960 --> 36:21.760
it was also chosen to be our wedding date last year.

36:21.760 --> 36:23.200
Like NBNB AM,

36:23.200 --> 36:26.800
we had a great sharing of wisdom among friends and family.

36:26.800 --> 36:28.080
And like NBNB AM,

36:28.080 --> 36:29.920
it was one of the best things in my life.

36:29.920 --> 36:30.880
Keep it up guys,

36:30.880 --> 36:32.560
and we'll see Travis in LA.

36:33.760 --> 36:34.000
What?

36:34.720 --> 36:35.120
Watch out.

36:35.120 --> 36:36.000
You will?

36:36.000 --> 36:37.680
Keep your eyes peeled, motherfucker.

36:38.240 --> 36:39.520
Yeah, we didn't even talk about-

36:39.520 --> 36:40.480
Well, I guess we did talk about

36:40.480 --> 36:41.920
how it was Justin's shit birthday.

36:42.640 --> 36:43.920
And my awesome birthday.

36:43.920 --> 36:46.160
Yeah, and I had a great birthday.

36:46.160 --> 36:48.000
I went and did karaoke.

36:48.000 --> 36:49.760
And now I'm playing Fallout 4.

36:49.760 --> 36:50.800
I ate a bunch of steak.

36:50.800 --> 36:52.400
Daddy mailed me a little present.

36:52.400 --> 36:53.200
He what?

36:53.200 --> 36:54.640
Daddy mailed me a little present

36:54.640 --> 36:56.400
just so I didn't feel left out.

36:56.960 --> 36:58.320
Oh, that's nice.

36:58.320 --> 37:02.400
Yeah, it's a little Hulk toy

37:03.680 --> 37:05.920
from the Avengers.

37:05.920 --> 37:07.440
It's like a little Hulk toy.

37:07.440 --> 37:08.960
And he squeezes legs together

37:08.960 --> 37:10.800
and he flexes his big old muscles

37:10.800 --> 37:11.280
and he goes,

37:11.280 --> 37:18.800
happy birthday, Griffin.

37:18.800 --> 37:19.440
Let's be honest,

37:19.440 --> 37:20.880
we live in a world with too much media.

37:20.880 --> 37:22.880
You need a podcast on the front lines

37:22.880 --> 37:24.320
figuring out what's great.

37:24.320 --> 37:25.280
We're here for you.

37:25.280 --> 37:26.240
We're Pop Rocket.

37:26.240 --> 37:27.440
I am Guy Branham.

37:27.440 --> 37:28.640
I'm a comedian.

37:28.640 --> 37:29.440
I'm Wynton Mitchell.

37:29.440 --> 37:31.360
I call myself a digital strategist.

37:31.360 --> 37:32.480
I'm Oliver Wang,

37:32.480 --> 37:34.240
academic and disc junkie.

37:34.240 --> 37:35.200
Margaret Wappler,

37:35.200 --> 37:36.480
je suis es journalist.

37:37.760 --> 37:39.040
And we watch, listen to,

37:39.040 --> 37:39.840
and read everything

37:39.840 --> 37:41.200
so that you don't have to.

37:41.200 --> 37:42.560
And then we tell you about all the things

37:42.560 --> 37:43.840
that you'll love to love.

37:43.840 --> 37:44.960
Find us in iTunes

37:44.960 --> 37:46.880
or wherever you download podcasts.

37:46.880 --> 37:47.520
Pop Rocket,

37:47.520 --> 37:49.440
every Wednesday from MaximumFun.org.

37:51.360 --> 37:52.800
Some classmates of mine recently-

37:52.800 --> 37:53.200
You guys want to Yahoo?

37:53.200 --> 37:54.720
Actually do Yahoo?

37:54.720 --> 37:56.000
That's what I was going to say.

37:56.000 --> 37:56.500
Sorry.

37:57.840 --> 37:59.280
Do you even want to keep doing Yahoo's

37:59.280 --> 38:00.080
in the show anymore?

38:00.080 --> 38:01.200
Like, do you want to stop doing them?

38:01.200 --> 38:03.360
Well, that is another part of the flavor

38:03.360 --> 38:05.440
that's been chomped so severely.

38:05.440 --> 38:07.120
I'm wondering if we need to move on.

38:07.120 --> 38:08.240
That one doesn't bother me.

38:08.240 --> 38:08.880
We didn't like-

38:08.880 --> 38:11.120
We didn't invent Yahoo's are dumb.

38:11.120 --> 38:12.560
Some people are sending us messages.

38:12.560 --> 38:15.840
It's like, I didn't program Yahoo Answers

38:15.840 --> 38:17.520
and get like a grassroots effort

38:17.520 --> 38:18.880
to build its user base.

38:19.520 --> 38:21.040
Yeah, but like a lot of people

38:21.040 --> 38:22.720
are tapping that Yahoo Answers.

38:22.720 --> 38:23.840
That is, that is true.

38:26.560 --> 38:27.840
Sent in by Zoe Kinski,

38:27.840 --> 38:28.640
climbing that ladder.

38:28.640 --> 38:29.360
Thank you, Zoe.

38:29.360 --> 38:30.560
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

38:30.560 --> 38:31.760
Sorry, something has gone wrong.

38:32.320 --> 38:34.800
We're just going to maybe refresh the page,

38:34.800 --> 38:37.120
see if data might populate.

38:37.120 --> 38:38.640
We'll see if this string,

38:38.640 --> 38:39.920
this text field, no.

38:41.280 --> 38:43.360
We're going to call him Ranald,

38:43.360 --> 38:44.560
which is like Ronald,

38:45.360 --> 38:46.400
but different, Ranald.

38:46.400 --> 38:47.280
But more active.

38:47.280 --> 38:48.160
Ranald asks,

38:50.480 --> 38:52.320
how to convert sexual energy

38:52.320 --> 38:54.320
into sporting and athletic prowess.

38:55.760 --> 38:57.200
I've read that everyone

38:57.200 --> 38:59.600
is really just sexual energy.

39:02.000 --> 39:02.800
Correct?

39:02.800 --> 39:03.040
Yeah.

39:03.040 --> 39:04.560
Just sexual protons and electrons

39:04.560 --> 39:05.680
just bounce off each other,

39:05.680 --> 39:07.200
generating electricity and stuff.

39:07.200 --> 39:08.880
I've read that everyone

39:08.880 --> 39:10.080
is really just sexual energy.

39:10.080 --> 39:11.280
I have lots of it

39:11.280 --> 39:12.960
and a really high sex drive.

39:12.960 --> 39:13.360
Wow.

39:13.360 --> 39:14.960
And I want to convert the energy

39:14.960 --> 39:15.680
so I can use it

39:15.680 --> 39:18.160
in my non-sexual physical endeavors.

39:18.160 --> 39:19.840
I do realize that when I'm horny,

39:19.840 --> 39:22.080
I seem filled with a lot of raging energy.

39:22.640 --> 39:24.160
You wouldn't like me when I'm horny.

39:25.520 --> 39:27.280
I seem filled with a lot of raging energy,

39:27.280 --> 39:29.120
but it's not there when I'm not.

39:29.120 --> 39:30.320
How do I control and use

39:30.320 --> 39:32.240
my massive sexual energy

39:32.240 --> 39:34.080
so I can be a super athlete?

39:34.800 --> 39:36.720
Oh, Ranald, you have to be so careful.

39:36.720 --> 39:38.880
You gotta be careful, Ranald.

39:39.520 --> 39:41.280
If you channel too much sexual energy,

39:41.280 --> 39:43.040
like, say, onto the basketball court,

39:43.040 --> 39:43.920
you are going to be getting

39:43.920 --> 39:45.840
personal fouls left and right.

39:45.840 --> 39:47.680
Yeah, against the audience.

39:49.200 --> 39:51.200
Extremely personal fouls.

39:51.200 --> 39:54.000
Against the viewers and the referees.

39:54.000 --> 39:55.280
Against decency.

39:55.920 --> 39:59.600
Against basketball shorts manufacturers.

40:02.560 --> 40:03.360
No, okay.

40:04.320 --> 40:06.640
I rarely defend Yahoo Answers questions.

40:06.640 --> 40:08.720
But I get where a stupid person...

40:08.720 --> 40:10.160
No, think about, like,

40:10.160 --> 40:11.840
it's pretty common parlance

40:11.840 --> 40:13.280
when you hear, like, the boxers

40:13.280 --> 40:15.040
that, like, they won't sleep

40:15.040 --> 40:16.400
with their wives before the fight

40:16.400 --> 40:17.680
or their girlfriends before the fight

40:17.680 --> 40:18.800
because they want to, like,

40:18.800 --> 40:20.240
save it all for the ring.

40:20.240 --> 40:21.600
That always confuses...

40:21.600 --> 40:23.520
Save all that dude juice?

40:23.520 --> 40:24.080
Right?

40:24.080 --> 40:25.120
But just that idea of, like,

40:25.120 --> 40:26.720
no, not before the fight.

40:26.720 --> 40:27.360
Really?

40:27.360 --> 40:27.760
Really?

40:27.760 --> 40:29.680
What are you going to do in that fight?

40:29.680 --> 40:30.180
Yeah.

40:32.320 --> 40:33.840
Boy, will he be surprised.

40:33.840 --> 40:35.120
All it takes at boxing,

40:35.120 --> 40:36.640
you just mentioned the beautiful sport.

40:38.320 --> 40:40.240
It's a game of, you know,

40:40.240 --> 40:42.000
that takes place in those fractions

40:42.000 --> 40:43.280
of hundreds of seconds.

40:43.920 --> 40:45.360
And you got to, like,

40:45.360 --> 40:46.640
they catch them off guard

40:46.640 --> 40:47.920
and you get that good hook in.

40:47.920 --> 40:49.920
And nothing's going to catch you off guard

40:49.920 --> 40:53.120
like a fucking raging hog

40:53.120 --> 40:56.560
inside billowy shorts with your name on it.

40:58.080 --> 41:00.640
I think the key here is to just...

41:00.640 --> 41:02.960
You got to do a little bit of, like,

41:02.960 --> 41:07.840
like a fantasy projection,

41:07.840 --> 41:09.760
the secret mnemonic device kind of thing

41:09.760 --> 41:11.040
where if you're...

41:11.040 --> 41:13.520
Let's say you're on the track at the meet

41:13.520 --> 41:15.520
and you got to run a hundred meter dash

41:16.240 --> 41:16.560
at...

41:16.560 --> 41:18.080
You just got to, like,

41:18.080 --> 41:20.160
keep telling yourself or pretend

41:20.160 --> 41:22.400
that at the end of that a hundred meters,

41:22.400 --> 41:24.640
there's a big old slice of juicy butt

41:24.640 --> 41:25.360
waiting for you.

41:25.360 --> 41:25.760
Yeah.

41:25.760 --> 41:26.880
You'll be able to carve...

41:26.880 --> 41:28.560
Like, if you're getting a touchdown

41:28.560 --> 41:29.600
and you got the ball,

41:29.600 --> 41:31.600
you just got to pretend like you're running

41:31.600 --> 41:34.560
to slam it into a big old slice of juicy butt.

41:34.560 --> 41:34.800
Yeah.

41:34.800 --> 41:36.320
And you can do that with pretty much anything.

41:36.320 --> 41:38.640
You can slam a basketball into a big,

41:38.640 --> 41:39.760
juicy butt, you know?

41:39.760 --> 41:40.400
Yeah, for sure.

41:40.400 --> 41:42.400
It is important when you get that touchdown

41:42.400 --> 41:44.080
that you then instantly remind yourself

41:44.080 --> 41:46.240
that there is no juicy butt there.

41:46.240 --> 41:47.120
Well, no, that's right.

41:47.120 --> 41:48.640
You might get an excessive celebration.

41:48.640 --> 41:51.120
That's why most touchdown dances

41:51.120 --> 41:51.920
that people do

41:51.920 --> 41:53.600
is actually just them looking for the butt.

41:53.600 --> 41:54.240
Where's the butt?

41:54.240 --> 41:54.720
Where is it?

41:55.520 --> 41:57.120
Oh, he's left into the crowd.

41:57.120 --> 41:57.680
Oh my God.

41:57.680 --> 42:00.080
Oh my God, that's that Lambo leap.

42:00.080 --> 42:01.680
That's that Lambo leap, my package.

42:01.680 --> 42:02.720
More like Lamboner.

42:02.720 --> 42:03.440
Yeah, got it.

42:03.440 --> 42:05.680
It's just looking for butt anywhere you can find it.

42:07.120 --> 42:07.840
You actually shouldn't-

42:07.840 --> 42:09.280
Just prowling the crowd.

42:09.280 --> 42:11.200
And that's why after most touchdown dances,

42:11.200 --> 42:14.960
most sports athletes look so disappointed.

42:16.320 --> 42:18.400
And then they have to cut the commercial instantly.

42:18.400 --> 42:18.640
Yeah.

42:18.640 --> 42:18.800
Yeah.

42:20.080 --> 42:21.440
You actually shouldn't break the spell

42:21.440 --> 42:22.640
until the game's over.

42:22.640 --> 42:24.800
So like, after you get a touchdown,

42:24.800 --> 42:25.840
you have to try to tell yourself

42:25.840 --> 42:28.960
the enemy team is trying to put their ball

42:28.960 --> 42:30.400
into your butt.

42:30.400 --> 42:31.280
Not your own butt,

42:31.280 --> 42:32.400
but your butt that you own.

42:32.400 --> 42:33.200
Your metaphorical butt.

42:33.200 --> 42:34.240
Your metaphorical butt.

42:34.240 --> 42:36.400
The juicy butt that you own yourself.

42:36.400 --> 42:38.240
And so you got to defend the butt.

42:38.240 --> 42:38.720
And then-

42:38.720 --> 42:39.040
Oh.

42:39.840 --> 42:41.440
So like an offensive lineman.

42:41.440 --> 42:44.000
To them, the quarterback is the butt.

42:44.000 --> 42:45.120
And they have to defend,

42:45.120 --> 42:46.880
oh, we will defend this butt.

42:47.600 --> 42:50.240
And that's why they dump the Colt Gatorade on a coach

42:50.240 --> 42:51.920
who has the most sexual energy.

42:51.920 --> 42:52.400
Oh yeah.

42:52.400 --> 42:54.160
Because they're trying to kill their boner.

42:54.160 --> 42:56.800
Hey dude, fucking cool it, okay?

42:56.800 --> 42:57.920
Okay.

42:57.920 --> 42:59.040
Coach, we get it.

42:59.040 --> 43:01.120
That's why everybody slaps each other's butts.

43:01.120 --> 43:01.440
Yeah.

43:01.440 --> 43:01.920
So I guess-

43:01.920 --> 43:03.040
Hey, you got the butt today.

43:03.680 --> 43:05.280
If you're a defender then,

43:05.280 --> 43:07.680
and you're rushing in to get a sack,

43:08.240 --> 43:09.600
that must be instant gratification

43:09.600 --> 43:11.200
because that quarterback looks like a big old butt.

43:11.200 --> 43:12.720
You just go diving right into it.

43:13.280 --> 43:16.000
Griffin, are you just quoting Denzel Washington's speech

43:16.000 --> 43:17.040
from Remember the Titans?

43:18.480 --> 43:20.880
You guys ever see somebody who's really good at curling?

43:20.880 --> 43:22.720
In their mind, they're using a giant brush

43:22.720 --> 43:25.680
to just polish up the juiciest slab of butt they can find.

43:25.680 --> 43:28.960
Oh my God, the whole sport takes place on a big frozen butt?

43:28.960 --> 43:30.160
It's all on a big butt

43:30.160 --> 43:31.440
and they're just polishing up the butt

43:31.440 --> 43:32.880
and they're thinking later on,

43:32.880 --> 43:35.600
I'm gonna grab a fork and dig into this butt,

43:35.600 --> 43:37.520
but not until I get it perfectly polished.

43:37.520 --> 43:40.880
Oops, perfect score, 20 points.

43:40.880 --> 43:42.640
That's why every NASCAR racer,

43:42.640 --> 43:45.440
if you actually, most of the windows are fully tinted

43:45.440 --> 43:46.640
so you can't see inside the car

43:46.640 --> 43:47.680
because if you did,

43:47.680 --> 43:49.760
you would see hanging from the rear view mirror

43:49.760 --> 43:52.720
is like a novelty plushy butt.

43:52.720 --> 43:54.480
And that's the carrot.

43:54.480 --> 43:55.760
And the drivers get confused, yeah,

43:55.760 --> 43:57.280
and they think, oh, I'm so close.

43:58.640 --> 43:59.680
They'll never get it though.

43:59.680 --> 44:00.800
They'll never get that butt.

44:02.320 --> 44:04.880
Well, that's, I mean, that's the sad truth.

44:04.880 --> 44:05.760
You know what I mean?

44:05.760 --> 44:07.360
Yeah, they never do.

44:07.360 --> 44:09.680
They never get that butt, it's never worth it.

44:09.680 --> 44:13.200
It's so sad that our successful professional athletes

44:13.200 --> 44:14.800
never have sex with anybody.

44:16.960 --> 44:20.000
In olden times with car racing,

44:20.000 --> 44:23.200
they used to have a butt on like a stick

44:23.200 --> 44:24.800
that ran around the track

44:24.800 --> 44:26.240
that people would just put on the brakes.

44:26.240 --> 44:27.520
Now they have a HUD,

44:27.520 --> 44:29.840
an electronic HUD AR display

44:29.840 --> 44:32.080
to project a butt onto the windshield.

44:33.680 --> 44:35.600
And all of this is why Wilt Chamberlain

44:35.600 --> 44:37.200
was so bad at basketball.

44:37.200 --> 44:40.000
Right, because he had to wear Google Glass

44:40.000 --> 44:41.600
with a picture of a butt on it.

44:41.600 --> 44:42.800
And he just used it all up.

44:42.800 --> 44:43.680
And he used it all up.

44:44.960 --> 44:47.920
It's just, you know, the original name of football,

44:47.920 --> 44:50.480
what they used to call it was Tumbling Cut Golds.

44:50.480 --> 44:54.720
I didn't know that, something I didn't know.

44:56.400 --> 44:58.000
Some classmates of mine recently informed me

44:58.000 --> 45:00.080
that I overused the phrase, oh geez,

45:00.080 --> 45:01.520
whenever I'm surprised by anything.

45:02.080 --> 45:03.200
This is really weird to me

45:03.200 --> 45:05.200
because I've heard them all say it before

45:05.200 --> 45:06.640
until they let me know they're only saying it

45:06.640 --> 45:07.600
because they're making fun of me.

45:07.600 --> 45:08.960
Oh no.

45:08.960 --> 45:09.840
That's a good look.

45:09.840 --> 45:11.360
Since then, everyone I've asked-

45:11.360 --> 45:12.480
How do I get new friends?

45:13.120 --> 45:15.280
It is something that only I say.

45:15.280 --> 45:19.280
Is oh geez an okay catchphrase to have

45:19.280 --> 45:21.120
or should I try to replace it with something else?

45:21.680 --> 45:23.440
That's from Need a New Catchphrase in New York.

45:23.440 --> 45:25.360
I'll point out to the listener at home

45:25.360 --> 45:26.960
because they will not be privy to this information

45:27.520 --> 45:29.840
that the question asker has spelled geez

45:29.840 --> 45:32.160
two different ways in this email,

45:32.160 --> 45:33.680
which makes me think that it's not something

45:33.680 --> 45:35.680
they use in written correspondence all that often.

45:35.680 --> 45:39.120
Or more of a vocal thing.

45:39.120 --> 45:40.400
Potentially, in that last sentence,

45:40.400 --> 45:41.520
they could be asking,

45:42.080 --> 45:43.840
because they spelled it G-E-E-Z,

45:44.640 --> 45:46.720
if it's okay if they change it to oh geez.

45:46.720 --> 45:51.760
Oh geez.

45:51.760 --> 45:53.280
I like it.

45:53.280 --> 45:54.080
It's endearing.

45:54.080 --> 45:56.160
But then again, I imagine by the time

45:56.160 --> 45:57.200
we reach the end of this bit,

45:57.200 --> 45:59.040
and we've said it two dozen times,

45:59.040 --> 46:00.800
I will not find it endearing.

46:00.800 --> 46:02.240
I think that you should do your...

46:02.880 --> 46:06.080
I think it's okay to have little quirks like this.

46:06.080 --> 46:07.040
I think it's okay.

46:07.040 --> 46:08.480
Especially, you know what I like about it

46:08.480 --> 46:09.600
is that it wasn't forced.

46:09.600 --> 46:10.800
It wasn't something you decided,

46:10.800 --> 46:12.240
hey, I'm gonna start saying this.

46:12.240 --> 46:15.920
It just sort of wormed its way into your pattern.

46:15.920 --> 46:17.280
You know what the problem is?

46:17.280 --> 46:19.440
And your friends took this away from you.

46:19.440 --> 46:20.560
Your innocence.

46:20.560 --> 46:25.200
Because now, the next year when you say oh geez,

46:25.200 --> 46:27.280
you'll click in your head.

46:27.280 --> 46:28.720
You'll hear it and be like, I'm sorry.

46:29.360 --> 46:30.800
That's what happened when Justin told me,

46:30.800 --> 46:32.640
I say, let me throw this out too much.

46:32.640 --> 46:34.320
You ruined it for me for a solid year.

46:35.120 --> 46:35.920
I'm back on it now.

46:35.920 --> 46:36.800
Other people will have to...

46:36.800 --> 46:39.120
If I wasn't defending our listeners

46:39.120 --> 46:42.560
from having to hear you say it all the time,

46:42.560 --> 46:44.720
if it was just casual conversation between the two of us,

46:44.720 --> 46:46.400
I would not have pointed it out.

46:46.400 --> 46:46.960
I appreciate that.

46:46.960 --> 46:48.880
We put out professional radio broadcast.

46:49.520 --> 46:50.320
People hear this?

46:50.320 --> 46:52.400
Can I ask you guys a question?

46:52.400 --> 46:56.400
I think nobody used catchphrases

46:56.400 --> 46:57.920
for like a wicked long time.

47:00.080 --> 47:02.640
Did Charlie Sheen sort of kick this whole thing off?

47:02.640 --> 47:04.480
Yes, Charlie Sheen started catchphrases.

47:04.480 --> 47:05.120
No, no, no, no, no.

47:05.120 --> 47:05.620
I'm not saying...

47:07.040 --> 47:09.600
Charlie Sheen, I'm not talking about Charlie Sheen

47:09.600 --> 47:11.360
on his hit show, Taftman.

47:12.080 --> 47:14.320
I'm talking about Charlie Sheen in life

47:14.320 --> 47:16.400
when he started saying winning about himself,

47:16.400 --> 47:18.240
and then like other people started saying winning,

47:18.240 --> 47:19.520
and then they stopped pretty quickly.

47:19.520 --> 47:21.680
But I think that planted the seeds in everyone's minds

47:21.680 --> 47:24.240
of just like, you can just say a word

47:25.360 --> 47:27.760
and have that sort of be your whole thing.

47:27.760 --> 47:29.200
And then you can put it on, you know,

47:29.200 --> 47:31.040
shirts and sell it and make money and stuff like that.

47:31.680 --> 47:34.000
And I feel like people didn't do this

47:34.000 --> 47:35.600
for like a really long time.

47:35.600 --> 47:37.280
Maybe back in the 30s they did, right?

47:37.280 --> 47:39.360
And it'd be like, show you for the haircut.

47:39.360 --> 47:40.640
Try to say hello.

47:40.640 --> 47:42.080
Yeah, and people would be like,

47:42.080 --> 47:44.400
ha ha, good one, Charles.

47:44.400 --> 47:45.920
I'm just confused.

47:45.920 --> 47:47.120
Charles Sheen, senior.

47:47.120 --> 47:49.040
Charles Sheen, senior, senior, senior.

47:49.040 --> 47:50.800
Because that was the name

47:50.800 --> 47:53.280
of the great, great, great grandfather of that family.

47:53.280 --> 47:54.080
Not Estevez.

47:55.840 --> 47:56.800
You know what I mean, though?

47:56.800 --> 47:57.680
Is there anything here?

47:59.360 --> 48:00.080
Is this something?

48:00.080 --> 48:00.960
Is this something?

48:02.640 --> 48:03.760
I think that it's hard to...

48:06.640 --> 48:09.520
It's hard to catch these, right?

48:09.520 --> 48:11.520
And like, it's hard to notice them

48:11.520 --> 48:13.120
warming their way into your speech patterns

48:13.120 --> 48:14.800
because people probably aren't calling you on it.

48:15.920 --> 48:18.960
I think that, you know, if this bothers you,

48:18.960 --> 48:21.680
if it bothers you that you say, oh geez,

48:21.680 --> 48:22.640
feel free to correct it.

48:22.640 --> 48:23.920
But I don't think it bothered you

48:23.920 --> 48:26.560
because you were saying it and just like living your life.

48:26.560 --> 48:27.840
Well, and here's the problem.

48:28.480 --> 48:30.080
Here's where I think the catch is.

48:30.080 --> 48:31.200
If you have a catchphrase,

48:31.200 --> 48:33.280
it's like you burst into a party, right?

48:33.280 --> 48:34.960
And you're like, the party's here, right?

48:34.960 --> 48:36.800
Nobody cheers and it's awesome, right?

48:36.800 --> 48:38.160
That's your catchphrase and you walk in.

48:38.160 --> 48:39.680
Versus what this sounds like,

48:39.680 --> 48:42.560
which is like a vocal tick where it's like,

48:42.560 --> 48:44.560
you know, something happens in your immediate reaction

48:44.560 --> 48:46.480
without thinking it's, oh geez, oh geez,

48:46.480 --> 48:48.560
oh geez, oh geez, right?

48:48.560 --> 48:50.080
Then you're not in control of it.

48:50.080 --> 48:51.840
I just hit that point, by the way, where I hate it.

48:52.400 --> 48:52.800
Yeah.

48:52.800 --> 48:54.800
Where I could see where that would be a little bit

48:54.800 --> 48:57.120
like disconcerting when you say it

48:57.120 --> 48:58.240
and someone's like, you just said it.

48:58.240 --> 48:59.200
And you're like, oh, did I?

48:59.200 --> 49:01.360
Oh, I didn't even realize I did.

49:02.000 --> 49:03.440
That can be off-putting.

49:03.440 --> 49:06.240
I had this with Hachi Machi for a while.

49:06.240 --> 49:07.600
Yeah, you sure did.

49:07.600 --> 49:09.760
Hachi Machi, of course, is an expression

49:10.400 --> 49:13.520
from the, I'll use the word failed.

49:13.520 --> 49:15.280
I guess it had a couple seasons,

49:15.280 --> 49:17.760
but John Lovitz's program, The Critic,

49:18.800 --> 49:21.760
it was something that The Critic said, Hachi Machi.

49:21.760 --> 49:25.280
It began as a reference to that hit series.

49:25.280 --> 49:27.920
And at some point, it just sort of like got out of control

49:27.920 --> 49:29.520
and then people would say Hachi Machi to me.

49:29.520 --> 49:32.640
And I still think it's a pretty good thing to say,

49:32.640 --> 49:35.120
but I definitely think I started leaning on it too much.

49:35.120 --> 49:36.560
Our dear listeners will remember

49:36.560 --> 49:39.760
when I, for like maybe two and a half years,

49:39.760 --> 49:42.880
I couldn't go five minutes without just yelling,

49:42.880 --> 49:43.680
get that dick.

49:45.120 --> 49:48.160
And that was sort of like my personal brand.

49:48.160 --> 49:49.280
I'll go ahead and call them what they were,

49:49.280 --> 49:50.800
which is brand cuffs.

49:50.800 --> 49:52.480
I just wanna say I'm very proud

49:52.480 --> 49:54.960
and I hope our listeners are proud of me

49:54.960 --> 49:57.920
in that I have done really well

49:58.800 --> 50:00.640
at following my New Year's resolution

50:00.640 --> 50:02.960
of not throwing it off to Luda as much.

50:02.960 --> 50:06.400
It's been a long time since I did it not on purpose.

50:06.400 --> 50:08.240
Yeah, well, and then there was that one time

50:08.240 --> 50:09.920
that we were at a party and Luda was there

50:09.920 --> 50:11.280
and you started to tell a story

50:11.280 --> 50:12.640
and then he started to tell a story

50:12.640 --> 50:13.520
like in the middle of your story

50:13.520 --> 50:16.480
and you were like, oh no, please, Ludacris, go ahead.

50:16.480 --> 50:16.980
Yeah.

50:17.600 --> 50:18.720
Continue, Ludacris.

50:18.720 --> 50:19.840
Please, Ludacris, go ahead and do me.

50:19.840 --> 50:20.880
No, but you tell it better.

50:20.880 --> 50:21.120
Yeah, yeah.

50:21.120 --> 50:21.760
You tell it better, Ludacris.

50:21.760 --> 50:22.720
No, you were there.

50:22.720 --> 50:24.480
Like you were on set with Paul.

50:24.480 --> 50:26.080
So you go ahead.

50:26.080 --> 50:27.920
No, you do it now, please.

50:27.920 --> 50:29.280
I just read it on IMDB.

50:29.280 --> 50:31.920
I wasn't there firsthand, please.

50:31.920 --> 50:32.800
Secondhand story.

50:34.240 --> 50:35.680
Luda tells it best.

50:35.680 --> 50:37.120
He does, ugh.

50:37.120 --> 50:40.480
And he does the voices and like jumps back and forth.

50:40.480 --> 50:41.920
Like he's doing an H-I-D-I.

50:41.920 --> 50:43.760
You know, he's like jumping left and right

50:43.760 --> 50:44.880
and talking to himself.

50:44.880 --> 50:48.640
And his The Rock is spot on.

50:48.640 --> 50:50.720
It's better than The Rock.

50:51.280 --> 50:52.000
Yeah, so head on over.

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
He's more The Rock than The Rock at this point.

50:54.000 --> 50:55.680
Head on over to maxfundstore.com

50:55.680 --> 50:58.880
where you'll find our new Luda tells it best t-shirt

50:59.680 --> 51:02.080
for sale in all sizes and colors.

51:02.080 --> 51:03.200
Should we wrap?

51:03.200 --> 51:04.160
Yeah, we should.

51:04.160 --> 51:06.160
Yeah, folks, that's gonna do it for us

51:06.160 --> 51:08.480
on this issue of My Brother, My Brother, Me,

51:08.480 --> 51:11.280
a magazine apparently that we print.

51:11.280 --> 51:12.240
Our zine.

51:12.240 --> 51:12.880
Our zine.

51:13.760 --> 51:15.120
Thank you so much for joining us.

51:16.640 --> 51:19.200
We didn't do our feature on Bernie Sanders

51:19.200 --> 51:21.840
and his campaign period.

51:22.400 --> 51:23.520
Burning it to the streets.

51:24.480 --> 51:26.640
But we will have a lot more fun

51:26.640 --> 51:28.560
and frivolity for you next time.

51:28.560 --> 51:29.840
So we hope you'll join us again.

51:30.400 --> 51:33.040
And we do wanna say thanks again to MeUndies.

51:33.040 --> 51:35.520

51:37.680 --> 51:41.600

51:41.600 --> 51:42.160
Oh my God.

51:42.960 --> 51:44.720
I wanna say some quick thank yous

51:44.720 --> 51:46.000
to people who have sent us things

51:46.000 --> 51:49.760
to the East Coast My Brother, My Brother, Me post.po box.

51:50.320 --> 51:51.920
Kyle sent us a lovely postcard.

51:51.920 --> 51:53.360
Sarah sent us a graduation notice.

51:53.360 --> 51:54.800
Robert sent us a graduation notice.

51:55.440 --> 51:57.360
We gotta save the date from Kristy and Eric.

51:58.480 --> 52:00.080
Sailor Steve sent us a postcard.

52:00.080 --> 52:02.320
Adam and Shelley Evsons sent a lovely postcard.

52:02.320 --> 52:06.000
Dane and Sean sent us some Sheetz cards

52:06.000 --> 52:08.560
from my YouTube show, Things I Bought at Sheetz.

52:08.560 --> 52:12.240
Kelsey slash Borf, that's her D and D name,

52:12.240 --> 52:14.560
sent us a ghost horse book.

52:15.440 --> 52:17.680
Donna sent us some lovely socks and stickers.

52:17.680 --> 52:19.520
Remind me to get those socks to you guys.

52:19.520 --> 52:22.400
They're from the UK, very continental.

52:23.440 --> 52:26.480
And Brittany sent me a bunch of crunchy bars

52:26.480 --> 52:28.720
which are Canadian, I think,

52:28.720 --> 52:30.960
and have sea foam wrapped in chocolate.

52:30.960 --> 52:34.480
And they were very delicious and I enjoy them very much.

52:34.480 --> 52:36.320
So thank you to all of you.

52:36.320 --> 52:38.880
And what is that P.O. box, Justin,

52:38.880 --> 52:39.760
in case anybody wants to send you something?

52:39.760 --> 52:42.880
P.O. box 54, Huntington Woods, Virginia, 25706.

52:42.880 --> 52:45.840
Oh, and to whoever subscribed that box

52:45.840 --> 52:48.640
to Western Horseman Magazine, go fuck yourself.

52:49.200 --> 52:51.280
It's always full, and I hate you.

52:53.280 --> 52:55.680
It's always full of eight issues of it

52:56.720 --> 52:59.280
and I have to throw it directly into the car by.

52:59.280 --> 53:00.880
An hourly magazine?

53:02.400 --> 53:03.440
Like my brother, my brother, me,

53:03.440 --> 53:05.200
it's a weekly magazine release.

53:05.200 --> 53:07.200
Oh shit, that's amazing.

53:07.200 --> 53:09.200
And if you would like to send anything

53:09.200 --> 53:13.520
to the West Coast box, it is P.O. box 341769,

53:13.520 --> 53:16.560
Los Angeles, California 90034.

53:16.560 --> 53:18.480
Subscribe his ass to Western Horseman.

53:18.480 --> 53:19.520
I would love that.

53:19.520 --> 53:21.520
I don't own a P.O. box for this specific reason.

53:21.520 --> 53:24.640
I'm gonna actually say, if you're hearing this,

53:25.760 --> 53:27.680
hopefully we'll get it out today on Tuesday.

53:27.680 --> 53:30.560
Please send in questions, and Yahoo's,

53:30.560 --> 53:31.920
if you usually do, don't wait,

53:31.920 --> 53:33.840
because we have to record another episode

53:34.480 --> 53:36.640
sometime in the next 72 hours,

53:36.640 --> 53:38.560
because I'm leaving town for like 10 days

53:38.560 --> 53:39.600
and we have to get one in,

53:39.600 --> 53:41.680
and I'm really worried that we won't have enough

53:41.680 --> 53:42.320
questions and stuff.

53:42.320 --> 53:43.760
So please send in questions, Yahoo's,

53:45.680 --> 53:49.040
Drew, Rachel, Zoe, Ira, the usuals, everybody, please.

53:49.040 --> 53:51.040
Jacob Locker, come out of retirement,

53:51.040 --> 53:51.920
dust off your brain.

53:51.920 --> 53:54.560
Yeah, he's actually sent some stuff in, I think.

53:55.120 --> 53:56.560
I love all my precious children.

53:56.560 --> 53:57.680
Anyway, please send in stuff,

53:57.680 --> 53:59.440
because we're gonna need a lot of it.

53:59.440 --> 54:02.800
And if you know any hot shit in Hong Kong,

54:03.520 --> 54:07.040
drop us a line, bim bam, at maximumfun.org.

54:07.040 --> 54:08.320
No racist jokes, though.

54:08.320 --> 54:10.080
I asked on Twitter a couple days ago,

54:10.080 --> 54:11.520
like, hey, what's good in Hong Kong?

54:11.520 --> 54:13.200
I got a lot of racist jokes.

54:13.200 --> 54:14.640
Not from listeners of the show, I'm sure,

54:14.640 --> 54:17.680
but just, you know, let me keep that shit in line.

54:18.800 --> 54:22.000
Just a reminder, Candle Nights 2015

54:22.000 --> 54:23.680
is coming up December 21st.

54:23.680 --> 54:26.000
It's a Monday in Huntington, West Virginia,

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
at the Big Sandy Superstore Arena.

54:28.000 --> 54:31.680
Tickets are on sale, bit.ly forward slash Candle Nights 2.

54:32.320 --> 54:34.400
I'm willing to bet at this point,

54:34.400 --> 54:35.440
we haven't gotten the numbers yet,

54:35.440 --> 54:37.840
but I'm betting we've sold about 50% of the tickets.

54:37.840 --> 54:39.680
That's my guess at this point.

54:39.680 --> 54:40.880
We'd love to see you there.

54:40.880 --> 54:42.720
It's our holiday, spectacular.

54:43.760 --> 54:45.600
Sawbones is gonna be there.

54:45.600 --> 54:46.560
We're gonna be there.

54:47.120 --> 54:49.600
It's in our hometown, so that's always fun.

54:49.600 --> 54:53.360
Last year, we had a day named after us by the mayor,

54:54.000 --> 54:55.200
and we dressed up as ghosts.

54:55.200 --> 54:58.320
Who knows what fun and frivolity will happen this year,

54:58.320 --> 55:00.240
and we would love it if you were there.

55:00.240 --> 55:04.800
Go to bit.ly forward slash Candle Nights 2.

55:07.040 --> 55:08.080
I think that's gonna do it for us, Max.

55:08.080 --> 55:08.800
I think that's it.

55:08.800 --> 55:09.120
Oh, thanks.

55:09.120 --> 55:09.760
It's our network.

55:10.400 --> 55:11.440
Thanks to them for having us,

55:11.440 --> 55:13.200
and go to all the shows there, they're great.

55:13.200 --> 55:14.480
Yes, yes, and thanks to John Roderick

55:14.480 --> 55:15.680
and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song

55:15.680 --> 55:17.440
instead of our trophy album, Putting the Days to Bed.

55:17.440 --> 55:18.400
We haven't done that, have we?

55:19.920 --> 55:21.040
What, no, no.

55:21.040 --> 55:22.240
Talked about it and thanked John Roderick.

55:22.240 --> 55:23.760
I spent a lot of time yesterday actually listening

55:23.760 --> 55:25.440
to When I Pretend to Fall.

55:25.440 --> 55:26.240
I mean, you know what?

55:26.240 --> 55:28.000
What if for like the next few episodes,

55:28.000 --> 55:29.440
instead of recommending Putting the Days to Bed,

55:29.440 --> 55:30.960
which is what our theme song is from,

55:30.960 --> 55:33.440
we'd recommend other great Long Winters albums.

55:33.440 --> 55:34.320
That sounds good to me.

55:35.040 --> 55:36.320
Also, just a quick reminder,

55:36.320 --> 55:38.800
because we got a couple emails about it this week.

55:38.800 --> 55:40.320
If you would like a Jumbotron,

55:40.320 --> 55:42.240
if you would like us to talk about you in the Money Zone,

55:42.240 --> 55:43.360
wish someone a happy birthday,

55:43.360 --> 55:45.200
talk about your website, whatever you would like,

55:45.200 --> 55:49.440
go to maximumfun.org forward slash Jumbotron to sign up.

55:49.440 --> 55:50.560
But just a word of warning,

55:50.560 --> 55:52.560
we're sold out for the next couple months.

55:52.560 --> 55:54.240
So if you would like something read

55:54.240 --> 55:57.120
and say January, February, March,

55:57.120 --> 55:58.480
now is the time to buy it.

55:58.480 --> 56:00.800
So don't wait or it may be a little while

56:00.800 --> 56:02.560
before you actually get to hear your message.

56:03.760 --> 56:10.320
This final Yahoo was sent in by Aaron Kiss or Kiss.

56:10.320 --> 56:10.960
Thank you, Aaron.

56:10.960 --> 56:13.200
It's by Yahoo Answers user Anders who asks,

56:15.040 --> 56:17.760
how to get a haircut similar to Joseph Stalin

56:17.760 --> 56:19.920
without showing the girl who cuts my hair

56:19.920 --> 56:24.480
a picture of Joseph Stalin?

56:24.480 --> 56:25.760
I'm Joseph McElroy.

56:25.760 --> 56:27.040
I'm Travis McElroy.

The federal government has millions of dollars

56:59.920 --> 57:01.680
in programs and opportunities

57:01.680 --> 57:03.680
that you need to seize today.

57:03.680 --> 57:05.120
You're a taxpayer, right?

57:05.120 --> 57:06.720
Well, then you've got it coming.

57:06.720 --> 57:08.000
Thanks to Uncle Sam,

57:08.000 --> 57:10.880
you can learn to get grants for education.

57:10.880 --> 57:12.320
Learn to ride a llama.

Force your dog to stop being so rambunctious.

Make a souffle that sets and stays set.

57:21.120 --> 57:23.760
Mount the heads of your enemies on spikes.

57:23.760 --> 57:26.160
Grind your own corrective lenses
