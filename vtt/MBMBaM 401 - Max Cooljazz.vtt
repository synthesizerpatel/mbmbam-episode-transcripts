00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:47.760
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me, an advice show for the modern era.

00:47.760 --> 00:52.720
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middlest brother, Travis McElroy.

00:52.720 --> 00:56.880
I'm your sweet baby brother, 30 under 30, media luminary, Griffin McElroy.

00:56.880 --> 01:01.360
Here it is. This is season three of My Brother, My Brother, and Me, the podcast.

01:02.080 --> 01:07.040
And I was I've been watching a lot of going back and like binging a lot of TV shows from,

01:07.040 --> 01:09.920
you know, that like started in 2012 and getting current.

01:09.920 --> 01:14.000
And I was thinking about it, and I think it's time that we had a character reset.

01:14.560 --> 01:19.760
Who? Which one of the three of us? Because I've got so much. Actually, you know what?

01:19.760 --> 01:27.440
But if we're able to volunteer, if this means shedding some of the lore or some of the vorlore

01:27.440 --> 01:32.880
about ourselves and just sort of rebooting and maybe we can even bring in a new actor to play

01:32.880 --> 01:37.360
30 under 30, media luminary, Griffin McElroy. I want you to know I'm already in talks with

01:37.360 --> 01:41.280
Adam Scott. I am working with Adam Scott. That is such a good get.

01:41.280 --> 01:45.360
It's such a good get. He plays kind of a cynical boy, I feel like,

01:45.360 --> 01:48.880
in a lot of his shows, though. And I don't know that that's my brand. We need to tell him,

01:48.880 --> 01:53.040
hey, maybe your brand's changing, Griffin. That's how a character reset works. For example,

01:53.040 --> 01:57.360
I've always been the kind of like curmudgeonly one, a little bit of a stick in the mud,

01:57.360 --> 02:04.240
a little bit of like, I take it way too seriously. And Justin's the sexpot.

02:04.240 --> 02:07.120
Right. Always talking about fannies.

02:07.840 --> 02:11.440
I would like to stay the elderly sexpot. Are you sure?

02:11.440 --> 02:19.280
Yeah. Yes. I feel like I've just started to really inhabit my role as an elderly sexpot

02:19.280 --> 02:26.720
and as a room-clean-hand style elderly sexpot. And I feel like I kind of want to stay there.

02:27.760 --> 02:29.520
That's the anchor. That's the anchor of the show.

02:29.520 --> 02:32.000
Yeah. I mean, do you want to go further with it, maybe?

02:32.960 --> 02:36.080
Oh, yeah. Older and sexier.

02:36.080 --> 02:42.080
Yeah. How old slash sexy do you feel comfortable playing and then go 10% beyond that?

02:42.080 --> 02:51.760
So I'm currently a very sexual septuagenarian. I could be a very, very sexual octogenarian.

02:51.760 --> 02:58.240
I would feel pretty uncomfortable with very, very, very sexual nonagenarian.

02:58.240 --> 03:04.000
Well, what we could do is we could make it a storyline within the show where you age rapidly

03:04.000 --> 03:08.880
and sex rapidly. I think the best thing we've done.

03:08.880 --> 03:15.840
I'm getting hornier. Someone get me some iron pills. Why did I pick up this cursed stone?

03:16.720 --> 03:22.480
I need calcium fascia to make my boner bone more better.

03:23.040 --> 03:29.680
Could we start at 150 very, very, very, very, very horny and then kind of walk it back?

03:29.680 --> 03:35.520
And I'm talking about almost a sort of bestial horniness, like an almost uncontrollable-

03:35.520 --> 03:39.200
Where all of Justin's responses to things just become deep grunts.

03:40.880 --> 03:43.360
One and a half centuries of just like,

03:45.760 --> 03:51.040
and then we'll be like, we'll get some feedback. We'll get some one stars from folks like too

03:51.040 --> 03:52.640
horny, too old and be like, all right.

03:52.640 --> 03:55.040
No, no, no. And then we'll hit a point where it's like,

03:55.040 --> 03:57.840
that's the right age, but maybe still a little too horny.

03:57.840 --> 04:02.640
So then it'll be like, all right, walk back. Now I'm 60 and I'm just kind of horny.

04:02.640 --> 04:04.720
And people will be like, I miss it a little bit though.

04:06.160 --> 04:08.240
We'll figure it out. Split the diff.

04:08.240 --> 04:13.760
Okay. So you're saying there's an exact age and an exact horniness.

04:14.960 --> 04:18.560
The sex Y axis where they meet. That's what we're looking for.

04:18.560 --> 04:24.560
Thank you. Yes. Yes. Yeah, I'll work on it.

04:24.560 --> 04:30.240
I feel like that should be in private more than in a public sort of forum like this.

04:30.240 --> 04:31.520
Is that fair to say?

04:32.240 --> 04:38.320
Yeah. I wonder also the etymology of the word sex pot.

04:39.200 --> 04:44.560
Were those in medieval times where people fucking boning down on pots?

04:44.560 --> 04:46.480
It's just like a big pot of sex.

04:47.280 --> 04:51.840
Yikes. Were people getting in it to do sex or were they doing sex to the pot?

04:51.840 --> 04:54.880
Fill it up with some sort of good feeling wax.

04:54.880 --> 04:58.400
They could just sort of make their own and explore the wax.

04:59.120 --> 05:00.000
All of the above.

05:01.200 --> 05:03.840
All right. And some of the below, if you know what I mean.

05:03.840 --> 05:06.800
So I'm still me, but older and sexier.

05:08.160 --> 05:10.480
Travis, what's going on with your character?

05:10.480 --> 05:14.400
You know, I was a curmudgeon, a stick in the mud, not having any fun,

05:14.400 --> 05:23.440
but I thought what if I instead took that in the direction of maybe I'm actually just a little doofy and maybe also a werewolf.

05:24.000 --> 05:28.160
Clean shaven, Travis. Maybe you take a turn being the youngest one.

05:28.160 --> 05:32.560
And then I'll get replaced by Bam Margera.

05:33.440 --> 05:33.940
Okay.

05:35.600 --> 05:37.520
I'm sorry. What was Adam Scott doing?

05:37.520 --> 05:42.240
He was going to be me, but then Bam came in and gave you the best performance audition of his fucking life.

05:42.240 --> 05:46.880
And so he's going to be me and he's going to do at least three stunts an episode like,

05:46.880 --> 05:48.400
okay, I have this hot coffee right here.

05:48.400 --> 05:49.760
Uh-oh, it spilled it.

05:49.760 --> 05:52.080
Okay, I'm going to stick with Adam Scott for now.

05:52.720 --> 05:55.040
Okay, but Bam can do his stunts.

05:55.040 --> 06:00.960
I've seen how Bam treated his father and his uncle and he's very cruel to those old men.

06:00.960 --> 06:08.320
And I don't want someone like that around me because I'm going to be so old and so sexual

06:08.320 --> 06:11.200
that I feel like it's going to be a very juicy target for Bam.

06:11.200 --> 06:15.200
Can we get Adam Scott in the mix, but call him Slam Margera

06:15.200 --> 06:18.560
and just have Adam Scott do stunts, hit our dad, and spill coffee all over us?

06:18.560 --> 06:20.800
I don't want anyone to hit our dad.

06:20.800 --> 06:25.440
Yeah, you seem very hung up on this one key aspect of the show.

06:25.440 --> 06:29.760
It's just, there was a zeitgeist, cultural zeitgeist, of the Jackass crew.

06:29.760 --> 06:32.160
And the Jackass crew's John Knox was like, what's up?

06:32.160 --> 06:34.720
Today, I'm just going to get hit by a fucking car.

06:34.720 --> 06:36.480
And everybody's like, yes, yes, we love this.

06:36.480 --> 06:38.800
And somebody, Pontius came in and was like,

06:38.800 --> 06:42.720
hey, this time I'm going to just jump off the building.

06:42.720 --> 06:48.320
Pontius Pilate is going to, this time I'm going to rule on Christ.

06:48.320 --> 06:49.920
Do you want me to get Barabbas?

06:49.920 --> 06:50.960
Do you want Christ or Barabbas?

06:50.960 --> 06:51.520
Christ or Barabbas, make up your mind.

06:51.520 --> 06:52.880
Christ or Barabbas, make up your pick.

06:52.880 --> 06:56.160
Also, do you want me to slam myself in the nuts with a huge monkey's fist knot?

06:56.160 --> 06:57.120
Okay, fine.

06:57.120 --> 06:58.000
Like sailors do.

06:58.000 --> 06:58.240
All right.

06:58.240 --> 07:01.920
And then Bilbo would come in and he was like,

07:01.920 --> 07:05.920
I'm going to just smoke a bunch of weed and maybe stable my nut sack.

07:06.640 --> 07:08.400
Okay, what?

07:08.400 --> 07:10.160
I couldn't remember the guy's actual, what is it?

07:10.160 --> 07:11.280
Stevo, not Bilbo.

07:11.280 --> 07:11.680
That's it.

07:11.680 --> 07:12.400
Okay, yeah.

07:12.400 --> 07:15.200
And then we were all loving it.

07:15.200 --> 07:16.400
Bilbo would come in.

07:16.400 --> 07:19.680
No, Bilbo is like so on point, Travis.

07:19.680 --> 07:21.040
That's like next level.

07:21.040 --> 07:25.200
How has no one asked Stevo if he knows Bilbo yet?

07:25.200 --> 07:27.840
That's like prime territory.

07:28.560 --> 07:34.640
We had like wild man come in and he'd like put his wiener in a fire truck ladder

07:34.640 --> 07:36.240
and like all these stunts, right?

07:36.240 --> 07:38.000
Stunts, stunts, stunts, unbelievable stunts.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.400
Then Bam shows up and people like, all right, what do you got?

07:40.400 --> 07:44.240
He's like, I'm going to slap my dad's belly while he's asleep.

07:44.240 --> 07:46.720
And it's like, that's the, wait, huh?

07:47.280 --> 07:47.600
Why?

07:48.800 --> 07:49.680
That's the stunt?

07:49.680 --> 07:52.080
Do you think the other jackasses were ever like,

07:52.720 --> 07:56.800
and today I got a good stunt, I'm going to slap Bam's dad's belly.

07:56.800 --> 07:59.840
And Bam would be like, actually, that's way out of line.

07:59.840 --> 08:00.880
That's my fucking dad, dude.

08:00.880 --> 08:02.240
That's my fucking dad, man.

08:02.240 --> 08:03.040
What are you?

08:03.040 --> 08:03.840
That's my blood.

08:03.840 --> 08:04.000
That's my blood in my belly.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.880
Johnny, you know we're brothers, but that's my dad.

08:06.880 --> 08:09.760
Maybe they should do a new jackass where they just do things

08:09.760 --> 08:12.480
that terrify people our age.

08:12.480 --> 08:16.000
Like, this week on Jackass, I'm pulling all the money out

08:16.000 --> 08:18.320
of my 401k before I'm 59 and a half.

08:18.320 --> 08:19.760
Going to be a huge tax penalty.

08:19.760 --> 08:20.560
Check it out.

08:20.560 --> 08:23.760
This week on Jackass, I'm going to call the customer help line

08:23.760 --> 08:27.040
for an airline and see if they can move my ticket to a different day.

08:27.040 --> 08:29.520
This week on Jackass, I'm just going to go to a music festival

08:29.520 --> 08:30.960
and there's going to be a lot of people there.

08:30.960 --> 08:35.760
Actually, that would be very, at this point in my life,

08:35.760 --> 08:38.480
if someone's like, dude, pack it up, we're going to Coachella,

08:38.480 --> 08:41.920
I would just scream like a rabid raccoon,

08:41.920 --> 08:43.920
just screaming, clawing at the walls.

08:43.920 --> 08:46.160
And they could fuse, they could fuse, they could fuse.

08:46.160 --> 08:51.200
Adam and Bam fuse like Steven Universe in the slam Margera.

08:51.200 --> 08:53.440
Or we could just make it like the Olsen twins

08:53.440 --> 08:56.720
where they would alternate, but you'd never know which one was which.

08:56.720 --> 08:59.440
And then Justin is like,

08:59.440 --> 09:03.680
Justin is anywhere between 60 and 150

09:03.680 --> 09:07.680
and anywhere between very horny and very, very, very, very, very horny.

09:08.800 --> 09:09.680
Okay, yes.

09:09.680 --> 09:11.200
But I have a request.

09:12.800 --> 09:18.960
I would like my role to be portrayed by host of the gong show, Tommy Maitland.

09:20.080 --> 09:22.800
I'd like him to take over for me.

09:24.320 --> 09:26.160
I think he's very multi-talented.

09:26.160 --> 09:27.200
Not Mike Myers.

09:27.200 --> 09:28.960
Oh, we could never get Mike Myers.

09:28.960 --> 09:32.080
But Tommy Maitland as Justin McElroy,

09:32.080 --> 09:35.760
I think would be, there's got to be an off-season for the gong show.

09:35.760 --> 09:36.000
Sure.

09:37.920 --> 09:39.040
All right, let's do it.

09:39.040 --> 09:41.600
401, countdown, countdown to 420.

09:41.600 --> 09:43.920
Lots of buzz about the 420 episode.

09:43.920 --> 09:46.000
Y'all, we don't know anything.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.680
We got nothing planned.

09:47.680 --> 09:51.280
Do you know how lucky we got that the timing of the Margaritaville thing

09:51.280 --> 09:53.040
was close enough to episode 400

09:53.040 --> 09:54.880
that it could look like we planned something for episode 400?

09:54.880 --> 09:56.000
Yes, exactly.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.840
Oh, also, it's a max fun drive.

09:57.840 --> 09:59.920
10 out of 10, should have mentioned that before.

09:59.920 --> 10:03.120

And we're going to talk more about those gifts

10:19.120 --> 10:20.080
and talk more about the drive.

10:20.080 --> 10:22.160

10:42.720 --> 10:45.040
Thank you in advance for your support, by the way.

10:45.040 --> 10:48.240
But right now we've wasted enough of your fucking precious time

10:48.800 --> 10:53.680
with panhandling and the jackass stuff, all of it.

10:53.680 --> 10:54.720
Our jackassery.

10:54.720 --> 10:56.400
Our jackassery.

10:57.600 --> 10:58.560
Let's get into some advice.

10:59.440 --> 11:00.480
Yesterday, someone from...

11:02.240 --> 11:03.440
I got three words in, y'all.

11:04.160 --> 11:06.560
Yeah, it's not like you skipped one.

11:06.560 --> 11:07.520
You added a word.

11:08.240 --> 11:13.840
Yesterday, someone was wandering around the office that I work in.

11:16.160 --> 11:17.520
Yikes and wowsers.

11:17.520 --> 11:20.800
Justin, prepositions are really not doing it for you today.

11:20.800 --> 11:23.920
There are some typographical issues that I'm trying to do.

11:23.920 --> 11:25.280
There are.

11:25.280 --> 11:28.400
Yesterday, someone was wandering around the office that I work in

11:28.400 --> 11:29.520
in a monkey costume.

11:29.520 --> 11:30.720
See, there was a missing in.

11:30.720 --> 11:33.520
No, that I work at in a monkey costume.

11:33.520 --> 11:36.880
In a monkey costume, making monkey noises

11:36.880 --> 11:38.640
and it scared the shit out of me.

11:39.360 --> 11:42.080
I was told later that I need to...

11:42.080 --> 11:42.880
You know what it is?

11:42.880 --> 11:43.280
What?

11:43.280 --> 11:44.080
Can I say something?

11:44.080 --> 11:44.880
This is not a joke.

11:44.880 --> 11:49.120
I'm gonna have to do this right here on the show.

11:49.120 --> 11:50.560
I have to increase my font size.

11:50.560 --> 11:54.400
Oh, you're getting older before our very eyes.

11:54.400 --> 11:55.360
I'm aging.

11:55.360 --> 11:56.800
Now are you getting hornier?

11:56.800 --> 11:57.600
Oh, yes.

11:58.240 --> 11:58.800
I knew it.

11:58.800 --> 11:59.360
This isn't right.

12:00.880 --> 12:04.480
I shall find no relief here on this podcast I make with my brothers.

12:04.480 --> 12:05.840
This is a terrible scenario.

12:05.840 --> 12:08.880
You know what folks love, a nice big juicy font.

12:10.240 --> 12:12.880
Yesterday, someone was wandering around the office that I work in

12:13.920 --> 12:16.800
in a monkey costume, making monkey noises

12:16.800 --> 12:18.320
and it scared the shit out of me.

12:18.320 --> 12:23.520
I was told later that this person was in fact our company's CEO

12:23.520 --> 12:25.120
and he does this every year

12:25.120 --> 12:27.440
during our company-wide free throw competition.

12:29.680 --> 12:31.200
You can't sneak that up on me.

12:31.200 --> 12:32.560
You want your bonus this year?

12:32.560 --> 12:34.320
All right, let's see how you do.

12:34.320 --> 12:38.320
Let's see if you got the help of that Taco Neck Syndrome.

12:38.320 --> 12:40.800
And that's my main sort of basketball reference

12:40.800 --> 12:43.760
is of course a Taco Bell commercial with Taco Neck Syndrome.

12:45.200 --> 12:47.520
I did not receive an explanation from my coworkers

12:47.520 --> 12:48.800
as to why he does this.

12:48.800 --> 12:50.320
Now, when they say why he does this,

12:50.320 --> 12:52.400
do they mean run around in a monkey costume

12:52.400 --> 12:55.440
or hold a free throw competition for the employees?

12:55.440 --> 12:58.640
I would say column A with a souson of column B.

12:58.640 --> 13:01.440
The issue is that I now have a perfectly reasonable fear

13:01.440 --> 13:04.320
of this monkey suit and do not know how to respond to this.

13:04.320 --> 13:06.800
How I extract myself from the situation next year

13:06.800 --> 13:11.040
and avoid the fear of death that this display inspires within me

13:11.040 --> 13:13.440
and that's from Scared and Confused in Denver.

13:13.440 --> 13:16.000
Okay, one, you work on the TV show The Office

13:16.000 --> 13:18.080
and the terrifying thing about that

13:18.080 --> 13:19.840
is it was canceled several years ago.

13:19.840 --> 13:22.640
So you are actually kind of a prisoner,

13:22.640 --> 13:25.520
an interdimensional prisoner who is larping

13:25.520 --> 13:27.280
or you're larping as the office.

13:28.080 --> 13:31.600
Can we all agree that the CEO owned this monkey suit

13:31.600 --> 13:35.600
prior to any kind of free throw competition happening

13:35.600 --> 13:38.720
and when the free throw competition started up

13:38.720 --> 13:42.160
or maybe the CEO even started the free throw competition

13:42.160 --> 13:46.800
as an excuse to wear the monkey suit that they already owned.

13:46.800 --> 13:48.400
You're gonna look for any opportunity.

13:48.400 --> 13:49.840
When all you've got is a monkey suit,

13:49.840 --> 13:51.360
everything looks like a free throw competition.

13:51.360 --> 13:53.440
Yes, we've always, that's the adage.

13:53.440 --> 13:55.600
I feel like different entertainment mediums

13:55.600 --> 14:02.800
have tried to get a fear of monkeys rapes going in me

14:03.680 --> 14:06.080
for three years and decades.

14:06.640 --> 14:10.800
And they just haven't succeeded like King Kong.

14:10.800 --> 14:13.760
The big monster's here, what is it, a big ape?

14:14.640 --> 14:17.760
That's fine, I'm not so scared of that I think.

14:17.760 --> 14:19.920
Uh oh, Rampage, what's the rock gonna do

14:19.920 --> 14:21.120
to get out of this sticky mess?

14:21.120 --> 14:22.560
There's a big, big ape.

14:22.560 --> 14:24.560
Well, it's just a big ape, Kongo.

14:24.560 --> 14:25.920
They're coming, the big apes.

14:25.920 --> 14:27.120
Are there dinosaurs too?

14:27.120 --> 14:28.240
No, just big apes.

14:28.240 --> 14:30.320
Like are there murderers in there too?

14:30.320 --> 14:32.640
Nope, just the big, just big gorillas.

14:32.640 --> 14:35.360
I'm not very afraid of that for some reason.

14:35.360 --> 14:39.520
Okay, the ape that you're discussing in Rampage

14:39.520 --> 14:41.360
is several dozen stories tall.

14:41.360 --> 14:43.040
So you're saying, you're telling me,

14:43.040 --> 14:51.440
if you saw a 200 foot giant gorilla coming at,

14:51.440 --> 14:53.200
and they're the same as apes, everybody,

14:53.200 --> 14:56.320
you saw a 200 foot giant gorilla running at you,

14:56.320 --> 14:58.720
you would just be like, mm, sorry.

14:58.720 --> 15:00.160
I'm not saying they're not dangerous.

15:00.800 --> 15:02.960
I'm just saying you're not afraid of them.

15:02.960 --> 15:04.800
Not, yeah, no.

15:05.360 --> 15:08.400
But they are dangerous, you're just not afraid of them.

15:08.400 --> 15:10.480
No, this is a big question, right?

15:10.480 --> 15:15.440
Is the monkey costume comical or realistic?

15:15.440 --> 15:17.600
Because if it's comical, I don't think about,

15:17.600 --> 15:20.320
but if I turned around in an office setting,

15:21.120 --> 15:23.680
a gorilla that I actually don't think I would be

15:23.680 --> 15:26.000
as scared about seeing in the wild, right?

15:26.000 --> 15:28.880
But if I turned around and saw a gorilla in my office,

15:30.240 --> 15:34.960
that might instill in me a bone deep lifelong fear.

15:35.680 --> 15:37.600
No, because it's a costume.

15:37.600 --> 15:39.440
One of my proudest achievements.

15:39.440 --> 15:40.960
I got scared of a werewolf once,

15:40.960 --> 15:42.640
and I'm still afraid of werewolves, Justin.

15:42.640 --> 15:46.640
Yes, but for me, one of my proudest achievements

15:46.640 --> 15:50.400
in life is I've never been fooled by a gorilla costume, ever.

15:50.400 --> 15:52.160
Not once, not for a second.

15:52.160 --> 15:54.720
Happens to people on prank shows literally all the time.

15:55.360 --> 15:56.480
Never happened to me.

15:56.480 --> 15:59.120
So I wouldn't have a fear of this.

16:00.480 --> 16:02.480
I need to drill down on something though,

16:02.480 --> 16:08.080
and I think it's important to this question maybe,

16:08.080 --> 16:09.600
but it's important to me definitely.

16:10.320 --> 16:13.440
You say that your boss does this every year

16:13.440 --> 16:14.800
during the free throw competition.

16:15.840 --> 16:19.680
And then you say, how can I avoid being scared

16:19.680 --> 16:20.720
like this next year?

16:23.120 --> 16:27.200
But in the question itself, you make no mention

16:28.000 --> 16:30.640
of being involved in a free throw competition.

16:30.640 --> 16:34.000
It's like a wild reverse Chekhov's gun,

16:34.000 --> 16:36.720
where like if the gun just emerged

16:36.720 --> 16:39.120
from somebody's belly button, and it's like,

16:39.120 --> 16:41.040
well, nobody's ever mentioned a gun before,

16:41.040 --> 16:42.720
and there's just like suddenly a gun.

16:43.840 --> 16:47.120
It seems very strange to me that you would not include

16:47.120 --> 16:49.680
the context of free throw competition

16:50.720 --> 16:51.840
in the initial question.

16:51.840 --> 16:53.440
It's a mental association you're saying.

16:53.440 --> 16:55.040
You're not afraid of the monkey costume.

16:55.040 --> 16:57.440
You're afraid of how bad you're just gonna brick one up

16:57.440 --> 17:00.000
there in the paint in this competition,

17:00.000 --> 17:04.320
and you have associated that fear with the big monkey.

17:05.360 --> 17:07.280
I can understand that.

17:07.280 --> 17:08.080
I get it.

17:08.080 --> 17:09.440
I'd feel the same way for sure.

17:09.440 --> 17:10.720
Oh, hell yeah.

17:10.720 --> 17:12.720
I'm thinking about my gorilla courage now.

17:13.520 --> 17:16.880
I think it's because of the gorilla on the front of the box

17:16.880 --> 17:20.000
for Gorilla Munch, the Enviro Kids organic cereal.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.840
I don't know if y'all have ever seen this gorilla,

17:21.840 --> 17:24.880
but he's looking at a bowl of this cereal

17:24.880 --> 17:26.400
and there's some strawberries in it

17:26.400 --> 17:27.600
and there's a little banner letting you know

17:27.600 --> 17:30.320
it is gluten-free and I'm sure the gorilla appreciates that.

17:31.120 --> 17:33.360
And he just looks so chill and so happy

17:33.360 --> 17:34.800
to just be close to this cereal.

17:34.800 --> 17:36.720
And I think when I see the Rampage monster,

17:36.720 --> 17:40.400
I see the King Kong, I see the Congo ones.

17:40.400 --> 17:42.160
I just think of this gorilla and I'm like,

17:42.160 --> 17:43.680
we have more in common than we have

17:43.680 --> 17:44.960
that separates us, little guy.

17:46.240 --> 17:47.920
Yeah, I guess that's beautiful.

17:49.440 --> 17:52.240
Yeah, so I guess we helped that one.

17:52.240 --> 17:52.960
How's the Yahoo?

17:54.400 --> 17:55.040
How's the Yahoo?

17:55.040 --> 17:56.160
A lot of people sent this one in.

17:56.160 --> 17:58.000
It's from an anonymous Yahoo Answers user,

17:58.000 --> 18:01.680
but I'm gonna call them Coco the gorilla.

18:02.240 --> 18:04.400
Type this in on the keyboard.

18:04.400 --> 18:07.680
Says, has anybody had sex in space

18:07.680 --> 18:09.360
to see if conception works in space?

18:12.720 --> 18:14.320
I did a little bit of cursory Googling.

18:15.120 --> 18:21.840
In space, your blood pressure gets low.

18:21.840 --> 18:28.320
And so, for those of us for whom a boner

18:28.320 --> 18:30.800
is an important part of the sexual process,

18:32.080 --> 18:35.040
I think we'd just be plumb out of luck

18:35.040 --> 18:38.320
without the help of some sort of special space belt,

18:39.360 --> 18:44.400
some sort of belt that these NASA scientists are working up.

18:44.400 --> 18:45.760
You know they're deep in their labs,

18:45.760 --> 18:47.360
like we gotta come up with a special belt.

18:47.360 --> 18:48.720
But I don't think they cracked that one yet,

18:48.720 --> 18:50.160
and so that's off the table.

18:50.160 --> 18:52.240
And I'm sure I don't want to be normative.

18:52.240 --> 18:53.920
There's lots of other options, right?

18:54.480 --> 18:58.080
But I also think like it's pretty small up there

18:58.080 --> 19:02.640
on like a ship, on this ISS, shuttle missions, no way.

19:02.640 --> 19:05.280
It's the size of like a jet, right?

19:05.280 --> 19:08.800
And that's a tough job to get some privacy up there

19:08.800 --> 19:10.640
unless everybody's nasty.

19:10.640 --> 19:13.120
And that's a lot to ask for a full flight crew.

19:13.120 --> 19:14.720
Hey, hey, hey, you get up there.

19:14.720 --> 19:16.160
Woo, launch went okay.

19:16.160 --> 19:16.960
Wow, that was scary.

19:16.960 --> 19:17.760
We went so fast.

19:17.760 --> 19:19.600
We're like, okay, we're gonna get up there.

19:19.600 --> 19:21.920
Fast, we're like 70 miles above the surface of the Earth.

19:21.920 --> 19:23.200
And that's kind of wild to think about.

19:23.200 --> 19:24.800
Wow, look at the space.

19:24.800 --> 19:26.880
I'm getting kind of existentially freaked out.

19:26.880 --> 19:30.720
Is everyone cool with like just doing it?

19:30.720 --> 19:33.440
You don't have to participate, but I'm going to,

19:33.440 --> 19:34.480
and you'll be close.

19:35.520 --> 19:37.360
And there's no way to vent the stink.

19:37.920 --> 19:38.800
There's no way.

19:39.760 --> 19:43.520
Now, I did some quick Googling.

19:43.520 --> 19:47.200
There have been, and not that sex should be relegated

19:47.200 --> 19:48.480
to just married couples,

19:48.480 --> 19:49.760
but there has been a married couple

19:49.760 --> 19:50.800
that traveled together in space.

19:51.440 --> 19:52.000
Yes.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.880
So, I mean, maybe they did it,

19:54.880 --> 19:56.800
but here's the thing, let's broaden our definition.

19:58.560 --> 20:01.040
That's very scientific, Travis.

20:01.040 --> 20:04.240
I have a theory with evidence and that is maybe they did it.

20:04.240 --> 20:06.640
They would have like, but okay.

20:06.640 --> 20:07.760
What about hand stuff?

20:09.120 --> 20:12.720
They would have to tell Houston.

20:14.560 --> 20:16.320
I think they would have to tell Houston for science.

20:16.320 --> 20:18.640
I think they would make it sexier not to tell Houston.

20:21.120 --> 20:22.400
I don't know if they did or not,

20:23.440 --> 20:26.400
but you know, when they got picked for the MISH,

20:26.400 --> 20:29.840
there was some nasty boys and girls in Houston

20:29.840 --> 20:34.880
who were like, so for scientific purposes,

20:34.880 --> 20:36.640
while y'all up there, are you gonna,

20:38.000 --> 20:40.560
oh, you know, don't make me say it.

20:40.560 --> 20:46.320
Oh gosh, are you gonna space?

20:46.320 --> 20:48.560
What's a good way, what's a good science way to put it?

20:48.560 --> 20:51.040
Are you gonna copulate?

20:53.920 --> 20:56.000
I asked them, Valerie, I asked them.

20:56.720 --> 20:57.120
I did it.

20:57.120 --> 20:57.840
He's just staring at me.

20:57.840 --> 20:58.720
Give me my $5.

20:58.720 --> 21:00.320
You said I wouldn't, but I did it.

21:00.320 --> 21:00.880
I did it.

21:02.640 --> 21:05.200
You think there's one idiot in Houston

21:05.200 --> 21:07.280
where like every time they go off mic,

21:07.280 --> 21:09.600
he's like, y'all gonna go boned?

21:09.600 --> 21:12.560
Like, no, no, Derek, we're not.

21:12.560 --> 21:13.360
For the last fucking time,

21:13.360 --> 21:15.760
we're gonna get out and get some moss.

21:15.760 --> 21:18.080
No, Derek, here's what I know

21:18.080 --> 21:20.640
about space missions and science research.

21:20.640 --> 21:25.760
We have done the most specific shit up there.

21:26.320 --> 21:30.160
I'm talking about fucking astronauts going up there,

21:30.160 --> 21:31.920
chilling on the ISS for a hundred years

21:31.920 --> 21:33.600
so they got a lot of time on their hands

21:33.600 --> 21:35.920
and they're getting science missions from Houston

21:35.920 --> 21:38.160
and they're like, what's on the docket today, Houston?

21:38.160 --> 21:41.280
And Houston's like, oh, you're gonna take this donut

21:41.280 --> 21:43.920
we sent up with you and spin it real fast

21:43.920 --> 21:46.800
so we see what happens when you spin a donut real fast

21:46.800 --> 21:48.640
because we've done everything else.

21:48.640 --> 21:51.440
If we're there, are you telling me

21:51.440 --> 21:53.600
that we haven't been at least a little bit curious

21:53.600 --> 21:56.960
about like if we traveled into space and went into the stars,

21:56.960 --> 22:00.960
if like making love would even be possible?

22:00.960 --> 22:01.680
That's the thing, right?

22:01.680 --> 22:03.840
Because if you're an astronaut, right?

22:03.840 --> 22:08.720
You're, listen, science, exploration, blah, blah, blah.

22:08.720 --> 22:10.880
But your dream is to be the first person

22:10.880 --> 22:13.120
to do blank in space, right?

22:13.120 --> 22:16.560
Like that's why you become, let's be honest,

22:16.560 --> 22:18.080
that's why you became an astronaut.

22:18.080 --> 22:20.960
You wanted to be the first person to do blank in space.

22:21.840 --> 22:25.360
And I guarantee, listen, we all humans,

22:26.160 --> 22:28.880
I guarantee someone has filled in that blank.

22:28.880 --> 22:29.520
You know what I mean?

22:30.320 --> 22:31.920
I don't think that's necessarily true, Travis.

22:31.920 --> 22:33.520
I don't think that's true, my bud.

22:33.520 --> 22:35.760
The suits are very heavy.

22:35.760 --> 22:37.440
Like they're just super heavy

22:37.440 --> 22:40.640
and the monitoring is unparalleled.

22:40.640 --> 22:43.760
I do not think these people have a few minutes to,

22:43.760 --> 22:47.600
like we sent you to space.

22:47.600 --> 22:51.280
Like please focus on science for a second.

22:51.280 --> 22:53.280
Unless you're like one of the people in the ISS

22:53.280 --> 22:56.640
who's of course sent there to live out their days

22:56.640 --> 22:57.680
and their return.

22:57.680 --> 23:00.000
It's space prison.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.640
You are sent there when you do astronaut crime

23:02.640 --> 23:06.640
and it's a great place I think to work out your sentence.

23:06.640 --> 23:08.480
But it is, it's-

23:08.480 --> 23:10.720
Living on the ISS does increase your chances

23:10.720 --> 23:11.680
of meeting the doctor.

23:12.240 --> 23:13.280
I mean, just like-

23:13.280 --> 23:13.760
That's true.

23:13.760 --> 23:15.520
Where is he more likely to show up?

23:15.520 --> 23:16.640
Or they, excuse me,

23:16.640 --> 23:18.160
where are they more likely to show up?

23:19.440 --> 23:20.480
On the space station.

23:21.840 --> 23:22.800
Here's another question.

23:23.360 --> 23:25.440
Also, when you nut and push you backwards,

23:25.440 --> 23:26.400
how's that supposed to work?

23:30.080 --> 23:30.720
Go ahead, Justin.

23:30.720 --> 23:33.440
I said my thing about when you nut, it pushes you backwards.

23:34.000 --> 23:35.200
Look at this script.

23:35.200 --> 23:36.640
Did we get a clean take though?

23:38.000 --> 23:39.840
Could we get a couple different reads on that one?

23:40.480 --> 23:41.040
Yeah, sure.

23:41.920 --> 23:44.240
Well, when you nut, it push you backwards.

23:45.840 --> 23:46.720
I don't know, y'all.

23:48.000 --> 23:48.400
I don't know.

23:50.480 --> 23:51.200
I don't know, y'all.

23:51.200 --> 23:53.040
When you nut, wouldn't it push you backwards?

23:53.040 --> 23:55.520
That's what I think from my own twisted skewed vision.

23:55.520 --> 23:58.240
Now, Griffin, could you give us one,

23:58.240 --> 24:01.760
like even you're nervous about saying it,

24:01.760 --> 24:03.840
like even you're unsure it's an okay thing to say?

24:04.560 --> 24:05.040
Yeah, sure.

24:08.160 --> 24:11.040
When you nut, nevermind.

24:11.040 --> 24:12.080
That was good.

24:12.080 --> 24:13.280
It pushed you backwards.

24:15.200 --> 24:17.440
Matt, could you give us one, like a really nerdy scientist?

24:19.120 --> 24:20.880
Let me like the test out.

24:20.880 --> 24:26.160
I have a theory that when you nut, it push you backward.

24:26.160 --> 24:28.640
Oh, you sounded so much like dad for a second.

24:28.640 --> 24:30.880
Yeah, it's actually scared me coming out of me.

24:30.880 --> 24:31.840
Yeah, I hated that.

24:32.880 --> 24:34.640
I can do one as our dad if you want.

24:34.640 --> 24:35.600
Yeah, do one as our dad.

24:36.400 --> 24:38.960
Well, when you nut, it push you backwards.

24:40.800 --> 24:41.600
The worst.

24:41.600 --> 24:43.600
I work for a company where my co-workers travel

24:43.600 --> 24:45.920
or work remotely so much.

24:45.920 --> 24:48.720
Master Bruce, when you nut, it push you backwards.

24:48.720 --> 24:51.200
So that was my cocaine.

24:51.200 --> 24:52.800
So we can be pushed backwards.

24:53.760 --> 24:55.520
Look outside the window of the space station.

24:55.520 --> 24:56.480
There's no stars.

24:56.480 --> 24:56.720
Why?

24:56.720 --> 24:58.800
Because they're all in here in this recording booth

24:58.800 --> 25:01.520
with Griffin, the master of impressions.

25:05.280 --> 25:08.160
Speaking of impressions, when I was watching Shape of Water,

25:12.560 --> 25:14.160
I don't know if you guys ever think this,

25:15.760 --> 25:17.200
and not with this specific person,

25:17.200 --> 25:20.000
but I thought for about 15 minutes while watching it

25:20.000 --> 25:21.360
that I had a Michael Shannon.

25:22.160 --> 25:24.880
And it was like I wanted to nurture it and nestle it

25:24.880 --> 25:27.760
and kind of grow it, but by the end of the film,

25:27.760 --> 25:28.960
it was gone from me.

25:29.520 --> 25:32.800
I didn't have a Michael Shannon anymore.

25:32.800 --> 25:35.200
I thought I had one, and it felt good.

25:35.200 --> 25:37.520
It felt like a good part of the repertoire,

25:37.520 --> 25:39.120
maybe not the most instantly recognizable,

25:39.120 --> 25:40.000
but still something.

25:40.880 --> 25:44.560
And then it left me, and I just wanted to share the loss.

25:44.560 --> 25:47.520
Did you think about the time that we saw Michael Shannon?

25:47.520 --> 25:49.440
We went out for drinks with Lynn.

25:49.440 --> 25:51.280
I don't know if this is okay to tell this story on the show,

25:51.280 --> 25:53.520
but we were having drinks and then all of a sudden

25:53.520 --> 25:56.720
there was Julia Roberts, and she was standing at her-

25:56.720 --> 25:57.680
It was not there for this.

25:58.320 --> 25:58.880
Oh, okay.

25:58.880 --> 26:00.320
It was not there for this one.

26:00.320 --> 26:02.480
Julia Roberts came to our table and just said hi,

26:02.480 --> 26:05.440
and we all said hi back.

26:05.440 --> 26:07.120
And there was a moment of just like,

26:07.120 --> 26:09.360
should we be greeting a person?

26:09.360 --> 26:11.120
Should we shake her hand?

26:11.120 --> 26:14.720
But it never came up because there was sort of just a vibe

26:14.720 --> 26:18.160
that we're not supposed to touch Julia Roberts.

26:18.800 --> 26:21.040
Not allowed to, definitely shouldn't.

26:21.040 --> 26:24.880
And then I think we ran into Matthew Broderick

26:24.880 --> 26:26.720
and Nathan Lane, and at that point I was like,

26:26.720 --> 26:28.640
I have to get the fuck out of here.

26:28.640 --> 26:31.840
I'm having full blown escape to Margaritaville,

26:31.840 --> 26:34.640
red carpet, panic, I need to go.

26:34.640 --> 26:37.680
And we were walking out and there was Michael Shannon

26:37.680 --> 26:38.320
by the door.

26:38.320 --> 26:39.840
And he walked up to Griffin and he was like,

26:39.840 --> 26:41.360
hey, you seem nervous, are you okay?

26:42.400 --> 26:43.360
That's not bad.

26:43.360 --> 26:45.600
But I saw him and I just bolted.

26:45.600 --> 26:47.760
I was just like, can't, can't, too much, too many.

26:47.760 --> 26:51.200
Come back, that sounds like a lot.

26:51.200 --> 26:53.520
Justin, is Michael Shannon here with us now?

26:53.520 --> 26:54.080
Can we speak?

26:54.080 --> 26:55.680
Let me see who's in here.

26:56.400 --> 26:57.680
Bring me the fish man.

26:57.680 --> 27:00.720
Can you say, oh, you know what would be a fun thing

27:00.720 --> 27:02.400
to hear Michael say, Mr. Shannon?

27:02.400 --> 27:06.320
Okay, I got it, no, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.

27:06.320 --> 27:10.800
When you nut in space it, push backwards.

27:10.800 --> 27:12.800
Now Griffin, could you give me a reading of that

27:12.800 --> 27:14.800
as Vincent D'Onofrio for Men in Black?

27:15.360 --> 27:17.040
Could I do one as the fish man instead?

27:17.040 --> 27:17.840
Oh, yes, yeah.

27:23.840 --> 27:24.800
I want to do this question.

27:24.800 --> 27:28.080
I do want to briefly apologize for the secondhand panic

27:28.080 --> 27:30.080
that we saw so many people tweet about

27:30.080 --> 27:33.360
listening to our episode 400 of the show.

27:33.360 --> 27:35.440
Like there was some legit, like we triggered

27:35.440 --> 27:38.480
some legit brutal anxiety reactions.

27:39.280 --> 27:42.320
I have not been able to listen to it since we recorded it.

27:42.320 --> 27:43.040
So I get it.

27:43.040 --> 27:47.280
If you finish it, there's an arc of triumph there.

27:47.280 --> 27:49.120
There's an arc de triumph.

27:49.120 --> 27:54.240
It is very, it is a tale of overcoming the fears

27:54.240 --> 27:55.520
that live in all of us.

27:55.520 --> 27:57.200
And when I say all of us, I mean the three of us

27:57.200 --> 27:58.720
and you at home listening.

27:58.720 --> 28:00.800
It's all about overcoming your fears

28:00.800 --> 28:04.240
until eventually you get dunked on real hard by Al Roker.

28:07.120 --> 28:08.000
All right, we're gonna do this question.

28:08.000 --> 28:10.640
Thank you, another thanks, by the way, ancillary thanks

28:10.640 --> 28:12.640
for everybody who tweeted about Al Roker

28:12.640 --> 28:14.240
or letting him know about Roker Poker.

28:14.240 --> 28:20.240
That makes me feel good and not scared for my like career.

28:20.480 --> 28:22.000
So cool and great.

28:22.000 --> 28:22.800
Cool, great.

28:23.840 --> 28:25.360
And again, apologies to Mary Lou Hinder.

28:26.320 --> 28:29.120
I work for a company where my coworkers travel

28:29.120 --> 28:30.720
or work remotely so much

28:31.360 --> 28:33.120
that I'm often the only one in the office.

28:34.080 --> 28:36.800
My job requires my physical presence.

28:36.800 --> 28:39.280
So I'm wondering how can I take best advantage

28:39.280 --> 28:42.480
of having this big downtown office all to myself?

28:42.480 --> 28:46.480
Keep in mind, a coworker could show up at any moment.

28:47.120 --> 28:49.600
That's from Unsupervised in Seattle.

28:50.720 --> 28:52.400
You know, I used to be in this scenario.

28:54.480 --> 28:58.880
When I was a disc jockey, a board operator technically

28:58.880 --> 29:01.280
for the radio station over the weekends,

29:01.280 --> 29:03.680
I would go in on the weekends and like literally

29:03.680 --> 29:05.360
you're just a human being there

29:06.160 --> 29:08.480
to make sure Brad Paisley keeps coming

29:08.480 --> 29:09.920
and that there's no silence.

29:09.920 --> 29:12.000
No, I'm sorry.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.920
And when he does, he's like pushing backwards.

29:17.200 --> 29:19.040
And I got too deep down the rabbit hole.

29:19.040 --> 29:21.280
I ended up like bringing in my PlayStation 2

29:21.280 --> 29:23.280
and hooking it up to the TV

29:23.280 --> 29:25.920
and getting myself a whole little game station

29:25.920 --> 29:27.760
and then people would come in and I'd have to look at him

29:27.760 --> 29:29.600
and just like, listen, I'm busted.

29:29.600 --> 29:30.640
You got me.

29:30.640 --> 29:31.600
This is what I do.

29:32.240 --> 29:32.880
You've got me.

29:32.880 --> 29:36.960
So it has to look like work, I guess is what I'm saying.

29:36.960 --> 29:42.000
Or be able to feasibly look like you're working.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.080
They didn't cover if they have to work.

29:44.640 --> 29:48.080
Like how much, you know, like everybody's got a job

29:48.080 --> 29:52.320
that has a job, but do you have to work the whole time

29:52.320 --> 29:54.560
or could you do your job in like half of the time?

29:54.560 --> 29:57.600
You know, season one and two curmudgeonly Travis would say,

29:57.600 --> 29:59.760
here's how you fill the time, you do your job.

29:59.760 --> 30:02.480
But here's what season three Travis is gonna say.

30:02.480 --> 30:07.280
Maybe every day you switch your desk with someone else's.

30:07.280 --> 30:11.600
And I mean, everything in it, everything on top of it, right?

30:11.600 --> 30:14.240
And then you just keep doing that every day

30:14.240 --> 30:17.920
until everybody's desk is in a different place in the office.

30:18.480 --> 30:19.840
Oh, fun.

30:20.400 --> 30:20.720
Right?

30:20.720 --> 30:22.480
I love these fucking pranks.

30:22.480 --> 30:24.480
People come in and they're like, oh, oh yeah,

30:24.480 --> 30:26.000
no, I guess I was over here.

30:26.000 --> 30:26.880
And that's for you.

30:26.880 --> 30:31.200
Videos of office pranks is my absolute best videos

30:31.200 --> 30:35.520
that I can find putting post-it notes all over somebody's shit

30:35.520 --> 30:38.240
or like flushing somebody's pictures of their family

30:38.240 --> 30:40.960
down the toilet or selling all the computers

30:40.960 --> 30:43.120
in the office for drugs.

30:43.120 --> 30:46.400
Like pranks is my best.

30:46.400 --> 30:48.800
That was my least favorite episode of The Office, by the way,

30:48.800 --> 30:50.960
when Jim sold all the computers for drugs.

30:51.680 --> 30:52.180
Yeah.

30:52.180 --> 30:58.180
My good video on the phone is, I did Facebook today

30:58.980 --> 31:03.540
and there was a video of a woman who yelled at a bear

31:04.180 --> 31:08.340
to tell the bear to go away and was mean to the bear

31:08.340 --> 31:10.820
and then said, I'm gonna spray you with pepper spray.

31:10.820 --> 31:12.660
And then she pepper sprayed the bear

31:13.220 --> 31:16.820
and then the bear destroyed her kayak as she watched

31:16.820 --> 31:20.340
and begged the bear to stop, even though she was so mean.

31:20.340 --> 31:23.380
The bear to stop, even though she was being mean to the bear

31:23.380 --> 31:24.820
and she deserved it.

31:24.820 --> 31:26.740
And then the bear destroyed her kayak

31:26.740 --> 31:28.420
and she screamed at the bear.

31:29.060 --> 31:30.500
Travis, what's your good video?

31:30.500 --> 31:33.460
But I do want to point out why she posts that, lady.

31:33.460 --> 31:36.820
Hey lady, your kayak got wrecked and you were mean to a bear

31:36.820 --> 31:39.700
and you were like, save, post to Facebook.

31:39.700 --> 31:40.580
I don't understand.

31:41.540 --> 31:44.580
I just like the ones where like the kids behave like adults

31:45.140 --> 31:47.860
and they like where kid talks and it's like,

31:47.860 --> 31:49.460
you understand English.

31:49.460 --> 31:52.500
Kids, kid driving on the highway.

31:52.500 --> 31:53.700
Yeah, kid paying taxes.

31:54.500 --> 31:55.540
Yeah, I love it.

31:55.540 --> 31:57.780
I like the ones that are kids reacting to things

31:57.780 --> 32:00.180
that I knew about, but they don't know about it

32:00.180 --> 32:02.020
because I'm gonna die before they know.

32:02.020 --> 32:03.460
Those drive me.

32:03.460 --> 32:05.380
And they say it like, who is this?

32:05.380 --> 32:07.140
This is the ape Donkey Kong.

32:07.140 --> 32:08.500
I hate his barrels.

32:08.500 --> 32:10.340
Justin will die before me.

32:10.340 --> 32:12.260
And they say that every day.

32:12.260 --> 32:13.140
Every one of them.

32:13.860 --> 32:14.660
Love that.

32:14.660 --> 32:15.380
Who is this?

32:15.380 --> 32:17.380
This is looking at a Game Boy and they're like,

32:17.380 --> 32:18.740
who could ever love this?

32:18.740 --> 32:20.420
Probably someone who's gonna die before me.

32:20.420 --> 32:23.940
If you know what this is, you're gonna die before I will.

32:23.940 --> 32:25.220
Who is this music?

32:25.220 --> 32:26.180
I don't like it.

32:26.180 --> 32:28.660
Bel Biv Devo, I don't even know who that is.

32:28.660 --> 32:30.580
Justin, your days are numbered.

32:30.580 --> 32:31.620
I will live forever.

32:32.340 --> 32:34.500
I want them to do videos like that

32:34.500 --> 32:36.980
where they have like college kids who are like,

32:36.980 --> 32:38.100
who did Nirvana?

32:39.140 --> 32:42.020
But then next to the camera pans over

32:42.020 --> 32:43.700
and there's like a three-year-old is like,

32:43.700 --> 32:44.900
what is Snapchat?

32:44.900 --> 32:47.620
And then at the same time the college student's like,

32:47.620 --> 32:50.180
oh fuck, it's a circle, huh?

32:50.180 --> 32:51.460
It's like a circle?

32:51.460 --> 32:52.180
Got it.

32:52.180 --> 32:52.660
Perfect.

32:52.660 --> 32:54.260
I would like to see a version of that video

32:54.260 --> 32:57.460
where it's me reacting to things that did happen

32:57.460 --> 32:59.540
while I was also in high school

32:59.540 --> 33:01.460
but I just was never privy to them

33:01.460 --> 33:03.140
because I wasn't cool enough.

33:03.140 --> 33:06.820
When it's like they play music that was popular in like 1996

33:06.820 --> 33:08.500
and I'm like, I don't know what this is.

33:08.500 --> 33:09.860
I do not know what this is.

33:11.460 --> 33:13.060
Boy, we really got away from that question

33:13.060 --> 33:14.740
but that happens sometimes here

33:14.740 --> 33:16.180
on My Brother, My Brother and Me

33:16.180 --> 33:18.660
and that's the kind of like twisted, again,

33:18.660 --> 33:22.020
South Park humor that we ask you

33:22.020 --> 33:23.860
to maybe think about supporting the show

33:23.860 --> 33:29.780
with a donation by joining the MaxFun support circle.

33:29.780 --> 33:30.020
Real quick.

33:30.020 --> 33:31.860
You can go to maximumfun.org slash donate

33:31.860 --> 33:34.180
and find out all the hot deets on that.

33:34.180 --> 33:35.220
Let me tell you how it works.

33:35.220 --> 33:36.580
So it works like this.

33:36.580 --> 33:39.860
You go to maximumfun.org slash donate.

33:39.860 --> 33:43.540
Then you pick a level that you are able to afford every month

33:44.820 --> 33:45.940
and listen, that's important.

33:45.940 --> 33:47.540
We know sometimes the spirit can move you

33:47.540 --> 33:48.260
and you know what?

33:48.260 --> 33:50.580
Sometimes you pick an aspirational level.

33:50.580 --> 33:51.140
Don't do that.

33:51.140 --> 33:52.100
We don't want you to do that.

33:52.100 --> 33:53.700
We want you to pick a level you can afford

33:53.700 --> 33:55.780
and it starts at just $5 a month.

33:55.780 --> 34:00.260
You pick that level and then you pick which shows you listen to

34:00.260 --> 34:02.100
and that is where your money goes.

34:02.740 --> 34:05.460
MaxFun takes a small percentage to cover their overhead costs

34:05.460 --> 34:08.820
but mostly you are directly supporting the shows

34:08.820 --> 34:10.900
and the hosts that you love.

34:10.900 --> 34:13.300
It's, I don't know of another system

34:13.300 --> 34:15.940
that works exactly like this.

34:15.940 --> 34:17.860
I mean, there's probably some crowdfunding ones.

34:17.860 --> 34:23.940
But literally any sort of pledge based public radio system

34:23.940 --> 34:26.100
works pretty close to this.

34:26.660 --> 34:28.020
Justin, $5 a month.

34:28.020 --> 34:29.700
Somebody joins us at that level.

34:29.700 --> 34:30.820
What are they gonna get?

34:30.820 --> 34:35.540
You're gonna get, I believe it's over 100 hours

34:35.540 --> 34:36.100
of bonus content.

34:36.100 --> 34:37.540
I actually calculated it this year.

34:37.540 --> 34:39.380
I think it's like more like 125.

34:39.380 --> 34:44.740
So like we're talking five days of bonus content for you to enjoy.

34:44.740 --> 34:48.420
And that's from all the shows on the network throughout time.

34:48.420 --> 34:51.060
So there's bonus MBMBAMs in there.

34:51.060 --> 34:53.540
This year we did all our old great segments

34:53.540 --> 34:59.300
like what would you even do if and monthly observances.

35:00.660 --> 35:02.420
We got lots of bonus MBMBAMs on there.

35:02.420 --> 35:03.940
This is our eighth year doing this.

35:04.820 --> 35:06.180
But then there's bonus JJGOs.

35:06.180 --> 35:07.380
There's bonus AdventureZones.

35:07.380 --> 35:09.300
There's bonus Schmaners.

35:09.300 --> 35:10.020
There's bonus everything.

35:10.020 --> 35:10.820
Bonus Jonas.

35:11.620 --> 35:13.220
Bonus Jonas is in there.

35:13.220 --> 35:15.620
There's an AdventureZone, by the way.

35:15.620 --> 35:17.300
Well, the one we did this year is really fun.

35:17.300 --> 35:19.540
It's for Sherlock Holmes and a vampire

35:19.540 --> 35:21.700
that is one of the aforementioned Sherlock Holmes.

35:21.700 --> 35:23.300
The Justin DM that was really fun.

35:23.300 --> 35:25.860
But there's also AdventureZone Nights,

35:25.860 --> 35:28.100
an arc with characters that you can only hear

35:29.620 --> 35:31.060
in the bonus content,

35:31.060 --> 35:33.780
including special guest Lin-Manuel Miranda

35:33.780 --> 35:35.460
playing Dungeons and Dragons with us,

35:35.460 --> 35:38.020
I believe for the only time in his entire life.

35:38.020 --> 35:39.540
Right, so $10 a month.

35:39.540 --> 35:42.020
You're gonna get everything at the lower,

35:42.020 --> 35:42.900
every time you step up,

35:42.900 --> 35:45.380
you get everything in the lower level.

35:45.380 --> 35:47.380
So at $10 a month, you get the bonus content

35:47.380 --> 35:49.380
and you get a drive exclusive enamel pin

35:49.380 --> 35:50.900
designed by Megan Lynn Cott.

35:52.180 --> 35:53.220
We did this last year.

35:53.220 --> 35:55.540
This year there's new designs for all the Max Fun shows

35:55.540 --> 35:57.700
and you get to pick your favorite when you make the donation

35:58.420 --> 35:59.940
and you get a Max Fun membership card.

35:59.940 --> 36:04.660
The pin for us this year is based on our battle cry,

36:04.660 --> 36:05.540
stronger together.

36:06.420 --> 36:10.260
You can see it at maximumfun.org.donate

36:10.260 --> 36:11.220
when you become a member.

36:11.220 --> 36:13.220
It is powerful and it lets people know

36:13.220 --> 36:14.340
sort of what you're all about.

36:15.220 --> 36:17.940
And I believe I've seen some people talking about like,

36:17.940 --> 36:19.540
oh, I can't choose between the pins.

36:19.540 --> 36:22.820
If we hit our goal of 25,000 new and upgrading donors,

36:22.820 --> 36:25.620
they will make pins available for purchase

36:25.620 --> 36:26.660
for whoever wants them.

36:27.380 --> 36:29.780
For people who donate at the $10 per month level.

36:30.580 --> 36:32.100
Travis, $20 per month.

36:32.100 --> 36:34.580
At $20 per month, you're gonna get the bonus content,

36:34.580 --> 36:35.620
you're gonna get the pin,

36:35.620 --> 36:37.780
but you're also gonna get the Max Fun family cookbook,

36:38.420 --> 36:42.340
which is lovingly curated with recipes for Max Fun hosts,

36:43.300 --> 36:45.060
anywhere from cocktails to desserts

36:45.060 --> 36:46.340
and everywhere in between.

36:46.900 --> 36:48.420
And also included in that,

36:48.420 --> 36:52.260
you're gonna get a set of space themed cookie cutters

36:52.260 --> 36:55.540
for you to use while I guess you make cocktails, you know.

36:56.500 --> 37:00.580
Justin put in a recipe from our mom's chest bars

37:00.580 --> 37:02.500
that were very, very, very tasty.

37:02.500 --> 37:05.620
Dad apparently let us know that the recipe

37:05.620 --> 37:10.260
for spaghetti-geddon, spaghetti-geddon is in the book.

37:10.260 --> 37:12.500
Rachel put in her chili recipe

37:12.500 --> 37:14.180
that we've talked about on Wonderful before.

37:14.740 --> 37:16.100
So we got a lot of stuff in there

37:16.100 --> 37:18.580
that you're gonna really, really get down on.

37:18.580 --> 37:21.700
If you wanna make a like podcast comedy magic,

37:21.700 --> 37:23.380
you gotta eat the spaghetti.

37:23.380 --> 37:26.500
It is not as funny as you remember it.

37:26.500 --> 37:29.140
So we have higher levels too.

37:29.140 --> 37:32.020
If you have the means and you wanna go in

37:32.020 --> 37:34.340
on those higher levels, we sure do appreciate you.

37:34.340 --> 37:38.340
But really we don't care what level you donate at.

37:38.340 --> 37:42.420
All that we care about is that you show your support

37:42.420 --> 37:44.820
in whatever capacity you are able to show it.

37:44.820 --> 37:45.780
It means a lot to us.

37:45.780 --> 37:48.500
It helps support us and the network.

37:48.500 --> 37:51.300
It has helped us turn this into a career.

37:51.300 --> 37:53.540
This is Travis's full-time job.

37:53.540 --> 37:58.500
This is what allowed dad to retire from the radio station.

37:58.500 --> 38:00.420
The radio station last year

38:00.420 --> 38:03.300
where he was working really bonkers hours

38:03.300 --> 38:04.740
and was kind of unhappy.

38:04.740 --> 38:06.340
And now he's just doing this full-time.

38:06.340 --> 38:07.300
Now he's just doing Adventure Zone full-time.

38:07.300 --> 38:08.100
And let me also be clear.

38:08.100 --> 38:08.740
That's really amazing.

38:08.740 --> 38:11.220
This is my only full-time job, but Justin and Griffin,

38:11.220 --> 38:12.980
I mean, even though you also work at Polygon,

38:12.980 --> 38:14.900
this is also full-time jobs for you.

38:14.900 --> 38:17.860
I mean, between recording this show,

38:17.860 --> 38:20.580
putting the Yahoos together and putting questions together

38:20.580 --> 38:23.140
and Adventure Zone and editing Adventure Zone

38:23.140 --> 38:24.580
and Justin doing Sawbones,

38:24.580 --> 38:28.100
like we are all podcasting full-time at this point

38:28.100 --> 38:28.900
and the reason for that.

38:28.900 --> 38:29.460
Yes.

38:29.460 --> 38:30.740
I'm not allowed to stop.

38:30.740 --> 38:31.940
Yeah, ever.

38:31.940 --> 38:34.660
No, it's important because I will say that not only,

38:35.300 --> 38:37.380
listen, I would be lying if I said

38:37.380 --> 38:39.380
the money didn't help make this a full-time job.

38:39.380 --> 38:40.420
That is how jobs work.

38:40.420 --> 38:41.940
But more than that,

38:41.940 --> 38:45.380
it is knowing how much this matters to people,

38:45.380 --> 38:47.860
directly seeing people every year tweet like,

38:47.860 --> 38:50.740
I supported NBNB AM because I love it, right?

38:50.740 --> 38:52.580
That lets us know, think about it this way.

38:52.580 --> 38:55.540
We've been doing it eight years and we have 400 episodes,

38:55.540 --> 38:58.660
which averages out to like 50 episodes a year.

38:58.660 --> 39:01.060
So we aren't missing episodes when we can help it.

39:01.060 --> 39:03.940
And the reason is we know how important it is to people.

39:03.940 --> 39:05.220
We know that this show matters.

39:05.220 --> 39:06.260
So we make it a priority.

39:06.260 --> 39:09.140
We treat it like a job and that's important.

39:09.140 --> 39:11.380
And it's a two-way street because when you donate,

39:11.380 --> 39:14.340
you know that you have helped support the show.

39:14.340 --> 39:16.500
Every time you listen to it from that point on,

39:16.500 --> 39:20.580
you will know that you're part of the supporting team

39:21.300 --> 39:23.220
and that's cool for you also,

39:23.220 --> 39:25.140
as well as receiving these great gifts.

39:25.140 --> 39:27.620
So maximumfund.orgs.donate.

39:27.620 --> 39:28.740
Pick the level that's right for you.

39:28.740 --> 39:30.420
Pick the shows that you listen to,

39:30.420 --> 39:31.620
where you want your money to go.

39:32.740 --> 39:34.100
And thank you all so, so, so much.

39:34.100 --> 39:36.020
I wanna say two more quick things before we move on.

39:36.020 --> 39:37.620
And that is it's important to note

39:37.620 --> 39:39.460
that the goal is not just new donors.

39:39.460 --> 39:40.740
It's also upgrading donors.

39:40.740 --> 39:43.060
So if you've been a member before, thank you so much.

39:43.060 --> 39:44.420
Can't say thank you enough.

39:44.420 --> 39:46.820
But if you started listening to more shows over the year

39:46.820 --> 39:49.140
and we have added a whole bunch of new shows

39:49.780 --> 39:51.700
or maybe just the shows that you listen to

39:51.700 --> 39:54.340
have filled an even more important part of your life,

39:54.340 --> 39:57.700
then maybe think about it's time to move from five to 10

39:57.700 --> 40:00.020
or 10 to 20 or whatever you wanna do.

40:00.020 --> 40:01.380
And also, we also understand

40:01.380 --> 40:02.740
that not everybody can afford it.

40:02.740 --> 40:03.780
We totally get that.

40:03.780 --> 40:07.620
That is very reasonable and we don't begrudge that at all.

40:07.620 --> 40:10.180
But you can still help by going on social media

40:10.180 --> 40:11.620
and spreading the word saying like,

40:11.620 --> 40:14.340
hey, it's hashtag Max Fund Drive.

40:14.340 --> 40:17.220
Make sure you go to maximumfund.orgs.donate

40:17.220 --> 40:19.220
and consider supporting the shows you love.

40:19.220 --> 40:21.140
That helps, that means the world to us.

40:21.140 --> 40:23.540
So just there's so many ways you can help

40:23.540 --> 40:24.740
and we really appreciate it.

40:26.340 --> 40:27.460
How about a Yahoo?

40:27.460 --> 40:28.980
Do it, coward.

40:30.100 --> 40:30.900
Okay.

40:30.900 --> 40:32.260
This one's sent by Morgan Davey.

40:32.260 --> 40:34.580
Keep it wavy, Morgan Davey, it's Yahoo Answers user.

40:34.580 --> 40:35.540
Sorry, something's gone wrong.

40:35.540 --> 40:36.820
I refuse, I refuse.

40:36.820 --> 40:38.420
You have an avatar, you've gotta have a name.

40:38.980 --> 40:40.100
You gotta have a fucking name.

40:40.900 --> 40:41.400
Shit.

40:42.180 --> 40:42.680
What?

40:43.060 --> 40:44.580
It just won't load.

40:44.580 --> 40:46.500
I'll call him Braxton.

40:46.500 --> 40:47.940
Okay, for a second, Griffin,

40:47.940 --> 40:49.300
I thought you were saying I'll call them.

40:50.260 --> 40:50.500
Okay.

40:50.500 --> 40:51.540
I'll call him, hold on.

40:51.540 --> 40:52.180
Hey, who's this?

40:52.180 --> 40:54.340
Yahoo weirdo, what's your name?

40:54.340 --> 40:55.140
Braxton?

40:55.140 --> 40:55.860
Great.

40:55.860 --> 40:59.460
Braxton asks, Billy Joel costume?

41:00.740 --> 41:03.540
I am doing a report as Billy Joel.

41:03.540 --> 41:05.060
We're gonna get the fuck into that

41:05.620 --> 41:07.940
before we get into the rest of the question, but okay.

41:07.940 --> 41:10.820
I have to give a speech and dress up like Billy.

41:11.940 --> 41:14.420
If I, you, would have any good suggestions

41:14.420 --> 41:16.180
for what I could wear, that'd be great, thanks.

41:17.060 --> 41:17.560
Okay.

41:18.100 --> 41:21.460
What is the Billy Joel report that you're giving?

41:21.460 --> 41:23.060
Is it a history class and you're doing like,

41:23.060 --> 41:25.700
oh, we didn't start the fire and it's just like,

41:25.700 --> 41:28.500
George Washington was the first president.

41:28.500 --> 41:30.980
He did his best and he had wooden teeth.

41:30.980 --> 41:31.480
Hey.

41:32.340 --> 41:36.980
Or maybe it's a report on Billy Joel as Billy Joel.

41:36.980 --> 41:39.780
Like you're Hal Holbrook of Billy Joel.

41:39.780 --> 41:40.980
I love it.

41:40.980 --> 41:43.140
Sir, this is US history.

41:43.140 --> 41:44.980
Yeah, Billy Joel made US history

41:44.980 --> 41:47.140
when he released his great album.

41:47.140 --> 41:51.060
I was born in Allentown, Pennsylvania.

41:52.900 --> 41:56.820
And one thing I know about me is I didn't start any fires.

41:57.540 --> 42:00.180
The year was 1889.

42:00.180 --> 42:02.340
I fell in love with an uptown girl.

42:05.220 --> 42:06.260
Billy Joel costume.

42:06.260 --> 42:06.740
What's gonna Billy Joel get across?

42:06.740 --> 42:10.180
I remember when I was born and for the longest time,

42:10.180 --> 42:10.900
I was a baby.

42:10.900 --> 42:11.940
All right.

42:11.940 --> 42:14.180
But Travis is sort of writing the report for them,

42:14.180 --> 42:16.500
which is gonna be a very helpful sort of thing

42:16.500 --> 42:17.860
when they listen to this episode,

42:17.860 --> 42:20.660
but they're not gonna know what to wear to be Billy Joel.

42:20.660 --> 42:22.340
Is a t-shirt that you have written,

42:22.340 --> 42:26.340
I am Billy Joel on it, out of the question.

42:26.340 --> 42:28.260
Hey, which Billy?

42:29.380 --> 42:30.900
There's a lot of different Billys.

42:30.900 --> 42:34.980
Nowadays, you're gonna go with kind of a black jacket,

42:34.980 --> 42:36.820
black pants, black t-shirt,

42:36.820 --> 42:40.580
black sunglasses, shaved head kind of Billy.

42:40.580 --> 42:42.660
Now, if you wanna go back to the days,

42:42.660 --> 42:43.780
get yourself some-

42:43.780 --> 42:46.100
White wall tires.

42:46.980 --> 42:50.820
Yes, white wall tires, so like big shoes.

42:50.820 --> 42:53.060
See like Billy was into big shoes

42:53.060 --> 42:56.580
and he kind of rolled up packs of cigarettes in his sleeves

42:56.580 --> 42:59.460
and he had acid wash jeans, which were huge.

43:00.820 --> 43:03.700
The still rock and roll to me look is very good.

43:03.700 --> 43:06.020
It's like a bright reddish orange jacket,

43:06.020 --> 43:09.620
white tie, black shirt, and just gigantic hair.

43:09.620 --> 43:14.020
Just the biggest, poofiest, very, very big hair.

43:14.020 --> 43:18.020
We could go early 90s, big colorful windbreaker,

43:18.020 --> 43:22.100
hyper color tank top, JNCO shorts,

43:22.100 --> 43:25.300
and sort of Birkenstock sandals.

43:25.300 --> 43:26.660
And that's when he was like,

43:26.660 --> 43:27.940
y'all remember that short period

43:27.940 --> 43:31.540
where he had his own little sort of like musical alter ego

43:31.540 --> 43:33.060
of max cool jazz?

43:35.780 --> 43:38.740
So you could do the very short sort of max cool jazz phase

43:38.740 --> 43:42.980
and that could be like a fun way of covering it.

43:42.980 --> 43:45.460
My favorite part of the max cool jazz phase

43:45.460 --> 43:48.980
is when the neighborhood kids would be like,

43:48.980 --> 43:51.460
hey mister, what's the max stand for?

43:51.460 --> 43:53.140
And he'd look at me with lower sunglasses

43:53.140 --> 43:55.220
and he'd say, maximum.

43:55.220 --> 43:57.940
And then they would know that he was playing cool jazz

43:57.940 --> 44:00.340
to the very limit of the art form.

44:00.340 --> 44:03.300
That's the coolest jazz we've ever heard.

44:03.300 --> 44:06.260
So show up in your max cool jazz cosplay

44:06.260 --> 44:10.340
and bring out your theremin, which people will be like,

44:10.340 --> 44:12.500
he'd be on the stage and they'd be like, piano man!

44:12.500 --> 44:14.420
And he'd be like, I don't have my piano.

44:14.420 --> 44:15.220
I don't have my piano.

44:15.220 --> 44:16.740
I'm the theremin man now, or thereman.

44:16.740 --> 44:19.060
I'm the theremin man, max cool jazz.

44:19.060 --> 44:24.020
And here's my new song, Space Aliens

44:24.020 --> 44:25.700
is the name of my new song, here it goes.

44:25.700 --> 44:27.620
Is there a question mark at the end of that, Griffin?

44:28.660 --> 44:29.940
It's more of like a surprise.

44:29.940 --> 44:30.980
Oh, okay.

44:30.980 --> 44:35.620
Yeah, so I think really the iconic for me

44:35.620 --> 44:37.860
is the black jacket, black shirt,

44:37.860 --> 44:39.780
black pants, shaved head, sunglasses.

44:42.100 --> 44:44.260
Maybe you have like a, but that,

44:45.860 --> 44:49.540
people might think that you're like a cool hit man,

44:49.540 --> 44:50.820
which is aesthetic.

44:50.820 --> 44:52.660
And so I think you need even more.

44:52.660 --> 44:55.220
Maybe you have a small piano that you bring out there

44:55.220 --> 44:58.260
with you just so people know.

44:58.260 --> 45:01.380
What if you built a diorama that you stood in

45:01.380 --> 45:05.940
that demonstrated you walking by the river of dreams, right?

45:05.940 --> 45:07.540
And it was like, oh, okay, clearly

45:07.540 --> 45:09.060
that's the river of dreams.

45:09.060 --> 45:10.500
And you're walking by it.

45:10.500 --> 45:11.860
Yes, we can do this.

45:12.420 --> 45:15.540
All, Deb, all black, shaved head, loving it.

45:15.540 --> 45:18.260
You walk into the classroom soaking wet.

45:18.260 --> 45:20.340
Just douse yourself in the bathroom.

45:20.340 --> 45:22.740
And also you're carrying a big plate of spaghetti.

45:22.740 --> 45:24.020
And people will be like, what?

45:24.020 --> 45:27.620
And you'll be like, looks like I fell into the river of dreams

45:27.620 --> 45:30.500
while on my way to the scenes from Italian restaurant.

45:30.500 --> 45:32.820
Oh yeah, walk into your classroom and say,

45:32.820 --> 45:34.980
who wants some red and who wants some white?

45:34.980 --> 45:37.540
And just start pouring some wine for your classmates.

45:37.540 --> 45:39.220
For your high school class and that's good.

45:39.220 --> 45:41.460
And, but I'll tell you what, you walk in that class

45:41.460 --> 45:43.380
dressed up like Billy Joel, soaking wet

45:43.380 --> 45:44.260
with a plate of spaghetti.

45:44.260 --> 45:46.180
People will be like, that's Billy Joel.

45:46.180 --> 45:48.980
You fell in the river of dreams on his way to the river,

45:48.980 --> 45:50.740
on the way to the Italian restaurant.

45:50.740 --> 45:51.380
I know what you're doing.

45:51.380 --> 45:53.460
That's Dr. William Joel if I've ever seen him.

45:54.260 --> 45:57.060
I'm trying to have fun with you guys,

45:57.060 --> 46:00.820
but Travis reminded me that it's still rock and roll to me.

46:00.820 --> 46:02.580
It makes me so angry.

46:03.860 --> 46:06.420
Do you mean the song in which Billy Joel has a conversation

46:06.980 --> 46:10.020
with himself about rock and roll

46:10.020 --> 46:13.540
and whether rock and roll is still itself rock and roll?

46:14.580 --> 46:16.900
Yeah, it's so hot.

46:19.140 --> 46:22.580
It's just, you read the lyrics and he says like,

46:24.020 --> 46:26.100
nowadays you can't be too sentimental.

46:26.100 --> 46:29.300
Your best bet's a true baby blue continental,

46:29.300 --> 46:30.900
hot funk, cool punk.

46:31.540 --> 46:35.300
Even if it's old junk, it's still rock and roll to me.

46:35.300 --> 46:38.180
It is so, I love a lot of Billy Joel songs

46:38.180 --> 46:39.700
and I do not mean to dunk on the man.

46:41.460 --> 46:43.460
It is wild to me that he wrote that

46:43.460 --> 46:45.700
and he looked at it and he's like, that's a song.

46:45.700 --> 46:48.260
And then he took it to other people with instruments

46:48.260 --> 46:51.060
and they were like, you got a song on your hands, Bill.

46:51.060 --> 46:55.060
And then they put it out and then America was like,

46:55.060 --> 46:56.500
what am I hearing?

46:56.500 --> 46:57.380
Is this a song?

46:57.940 --> 46:59.460
Because it sounds like a song.

46:59.460 --> 47:03.060
And I'm the, I feel like the lone man on an island

47:03.060 --> 47:05.060
who's like, it's not a song.

47:05.060 --> 47:06.660
There's nothing, he said nothing.

47:06.660 --> 47:07.220
It fills in.

47:07.220 --> 47:07.860
What are we doing?

47:07.860 --> 47:11.380
It fits into a category of song that is one of my favorites.

47:11.380 --> 47:13.300
Oh, we're going to talk about this again.

47:13.300 --> 47:15.540
I should warn you before you go too deep on this,

47:15.540 --> 47:19.300
we talked about this exact category on our last song episode.

47:19.300 --> 47:21.940
Songs that reaffirm that rock and roll still exists.

47:22.580 --> 47:23.140
Yes, we can.

47:23.140 --> 47:25.460
Oh no, well my new favorite one,

47:25.460 --> 47:28.660
because I was listening to the new train song

47:28.660 --> 47:31.700
that is set to the music of No Joke, Heart and Soul.

47:32.500 --> 47:33.940
Yes, what are they doing?

47:34.660 --> 47:36.340
You didn't do a song.

47:36.340 --> 47:38.420
He forgot how to play piano.

47:38.420 --> 47:40.820
And the song is a self-referential song

47:41.620 --> 47:44.260
that references the song in third person

47:44.260 --> 47:46.820
that says, hey, play that song.

47:48.180 --> 47:50.340
Not this song, but that song.

47:50.340 --> 47:54.900
That other song, it's like it is train's version

47:54.900 --> 47:57.380
of the greatest song in the world by Tenacious D.

47:57.380 --> 47:58.420
It's not the greatest song in the world.

47:58.420 --> 47:59.060
It's just a tribute.

47:59.060 --> 48:00.500
It's just a tribute to that.

48:00.500 --> 48:01.700
And it made me start thinking about

48:01.700 --> 48:02.900
how many songs there are that are like,

48:02.900 --> 48:05.380
hey, Mr. DJ, put that record on.

48:05.380 --> 48:07.140
I want to dance with my baby.

48:07.140 --> 48:07.700
What record?

48:07.700 --> 48:08.500
You know the what.

48:08.500 --> 48:10.980
You know what I'm talking about.

48:10.980 --> 48:15.940
I'm talking about Max Cool Jazz's Kind of Blue 2.

48:15.940 --> 48:17.540
I think you can wear whatever you want

48:17.540 --> 48:19.220
for your Billy Joel report.

48:19.220 --> 48:21.060
But let me paint the scene.

48:21.060 --> 48:22.740
Teachers in front of class and they're like,

48:22.740 --> 48:26.180
Dylan, Dylan, it's time for your report.

48:26.180 --> 48:27.620
Has anybody seen Dylan?

48:27.620 --> 48:31.300
And then you smash it through the wall in your car.

48:31.300 --> 48:33.700
Griffin, we went the whole bit

48:33.700 --> 48:37.700
without referencing the most obvious joke.

48:37.700 --> 48:38.980
And then you get out and you're like,

48:38.980 --> 48:40.260
what's up, everybody?

48:40.260 --> 48:41.380
So, piano man.

48:42.740 --> 48:44.420
We went the whole bit without mentioning

48:44.420 --> 48:48.260
that he was married to somebody from West Virginia

48:48.260 --> 48:49.060
that we grew up with.

48:50.020 --> 48:51.060
And then he crashed his car

48:51.060 --> 48:53.060
into three houses in two years.

48:53.060 --> 48:55.940
Yeah, but I guess I'm, okay.

48:55.940 --> 49:00.500
Well, anyway, so that's it for that bit.

49:04.500 --> 49:05.140
Billy Joel?

49:06.900 --> 49:07.940
Hey, it's Billy Joel.

49:07.940 --> 49:08.980
I want him on.

49:08.980 --> 49:09.480
Joel.

49:10.100 --> 49:10.600
Jazz.

49:12.180 --> 49:13.700
I want him on.

49:13.700 --> 49:14.500
River of Dreams.

49:14.500 --> 49:15.220
Uptown.

49:15.220 --> 49:16.740
Uptown.

49:16.740 --> 49:19.140
This one isn't, real quick,

49:19.140 --> 49:23.220
this isn't for the Munch Squad specifically,

49:23.220 --> 49:24.340
but it is part of the podcast.

49:24.340 --> 49:25.060
Welcome to Munch Squad.

49:25.060 --> 49:27.380
It's a podcast within a podcast about what's hot,

49:27.380 --> 49:29.460
what's new in the world of fast food.

49:29.460 --> 49:32.580
Want to say, big Munch Squad, congratulations to Brad Reed.

49:32.580 --> 49:34.660
Just got promoted to chief development officer

49:34.660 --> 49:35.540
over at Captain D's.

49:36.100 --> 49:37.620
So congrats, Brad.

49:38.500 --> 49:42.020
He is moving up after being vice president

49:42.020 --> 49:42.740
of franchise operations.

49:42.740 --> 49:45.060
How do they not fucking call that like first mate

49:45.060 --> 49:46.340
in charge of development?

49:46.340 --> 49:46.980
You know what I mean?

49:46.980 --> 49:49.700
Well, because it's a publicly traded company, Travis.

49:49.700 --> 49:51.060
I think they probably want to handle things

49:51.060 --> 49:52.820
like other normal ones.

49:52.820 --> 49:55.300
No, I want to talk about Zaxby's.

49:57.860 --> 50:01.060
I literally don't know what word you just said, my friend.

50:01.060 --> 50:01.620
That's fine.

50:01.620 --> 50:03.380
Zaxby's is a chicken chain.

50:03.380 --> 50:04.260
Run by aliens.

50:04.980 --> 50:05.700
In the south.

50:06.260 --> 50:08.100
Hello, I am Zaxby.

50:08.100 --> 50:14.340
We have zapped your small birds with our laser guns.

50:15.940 --> 50:16.740
Mr. Joel.

50:17.860 --> 50:20.740
Mr. Joel, the Earth's last hope.

50:21.380 --> 50:24.420
Billy Joel, you'll never stop us now.

50:25.460 --> 50:26.740
What's that new sound?

50:27.380 --> 50:28.340
It's actually not a new sound.

50:28.340 --> 50:29.540
This isn't rock and roll.

50:30.180 --> 50:31.380
This isn't rock and roll.

50:31.380 --> 50:32.260
It is to me.

50:32.260 --> 50:33.780
Well, Bill, you can't just say that.

50:33.780 --> 50:35.220
Anyway, Zaxby's is a chicken.

50:35.220 --> 50:38.100
Who's that champion in the car with whitewalled tires?

50:40.020 --> 50:41.940
And why is he driving at our restaurant

50:41.940 --> 50:43.300
so fast and recklessly?

50:43.300 --> 50:45.460
Slow down, Mr. Joel.

50:46.420 --> 50:49.060
No, it's a chicken chain in the south.

50:49.060 --> 50:49.780
It's very good.

50:49.780 --> 50:54.340
I only get to enjoy it when I'm headed to the beach

50:54.340 --> 50:55.380
to get on island time.

50:56.820 --> 50:58.500
Me and the Smurls will always make a point.

50:58.500 --> 51:00.340
Well, I kind of bully them into it.

51:00.340 --> 51:03.140
They have a of driving through a Zaxby's.

51:03.140 --> 51:04.580
Not driving through a Zaxby's.

51:04.580 --> 51:05.540
I'm not Billy Joel.

51:05.540 --> 51:06.260
Driving to a Zaxby's.

51:06.260 --> 51:08.020
Can we leave Mr. Joel alone?

51:08.020 --> 51:10.420
We broke the seventh seal.

51:10.420 --> 51:12.340
The horn's on high blue.

51:12.340 --> 51:14.340
And then we knew that there were only jokes

51:14.340 --> 51:16.500
we were going to tell for the rest of the episode.

51:16.500 --> 51:16.740
Okay.

51:17.620 --> 51:17.860
Okay.

51:18.980 --> 51:24.740
Zaxby's has good news for Zaxby's fans.

51:25.540 --> 51:32.020
The zenzational, the zenzation salad is returning to Zaxby's

51:32.020 --> 51:32.900
for a limited time.

51:32.900 --> 51:34.340
My teeth already fucking hurt.

51:34.340 --> 51:36.500
And I've already only done it a couple of times.

51:36.500 --> 51:38.420
As requested by thousands of fans,

51:39.300 --> 51:42.660
Zaxby's is bringing back the zenzation salad

51:42.660 --> 51:47.220
at all Zaxby's locations in 17 states from April 2nd.

51:47.220 --> 51:47.460
Okay.

51:47.460 --> 51:51.300
So you've only missed a few days of it to July 1st

51:51.300 --> 51:54.500
with bright flavors and bold textures.

51:54.500 --> 51:56.020
The zenzation salad.

51:56.020 --> 51:56.500
Oh, God.

51:56.500 --> 51:58.020
It's really getting uncomfortable now.

51:58.020 --> 52:00.180
Guys, like make Z's over and over again.

52:00.180 --> 52:00.900
It really starts to get.

52:00.900 --> 52:02.260
No, I was in speech therapy.

52:02.260 --> 52:02.580
I know.

52:03.140 --> 52:04.260
Bad mouth feel.

52:04.260 --> 52:09.860
Combines indescribably great ingredients with Asian flair.

52:09.860 --> 52:11.940
Not a good word to describe food.

52:12.900 --> 52:13.300
Yeah.

52:13.300 --> 52:15.220
Indescribably great.

52:15.220 --> 52:16.820
But what's in it, Zaxby's?

52:16.820 --> 52:18.180
I wish I could tell you.

52:19.380 --> 52:20.580
We don't even know.

52:20.580 --> 52:22.580
There are no words in your human tongue.

52:24.820 --> 52:29.300
The zenzation salad is our most frequently requested

52:29.300 --> 52:32.180
limited time offer item, says Stephanie Gamble,

52:32.180 --> 52:33.940
vice president of menu innovation.

52:33.940 --> 52:37.860
And we continue to bring it back because guests love it.

52:38.580 --> 52:43.060
I can't begin to tell you how many times we've heard.

52:44.500 --> 52:48.180
I don't even eat salads, but I love the zenzation.

52:48.740 --> 52:49.300
So wait.

52:50.260 --> 52:54.420
Finally, a salad for people that wouldn't touch a salad

52:54.420 --> 52:56.260
with their neighbor's fork.

52:56.260 --> 52:57.460
They wouldn't get near it.

52:57.460 --> 53:00.900
But now you've got the one salad, the zenzation.

53:00.900 --> 53:03.460
It's been about four minutes now since I found out

53:03.460 --> 53:05.460
we were doing a salad one.

53:05.460 --> 53:08.340
And now my mind won't stop racing

53:08.340 --> 53:10.420
thinking of what they have put on this

53:10.420 --> 53:14.820
to make the texture so indescribable.

53:14.820 --> 53:17.060
I'm like, I'm thinking Takis.

53:17.700 --> 53:19.940
I'm thinking this one's maybe got Takis.

53:20.900 --> 53:24.740
So the zenzation provides sweet and savory flavors

53:24.740 --> 53:32.180
like sesame, pineapple, orange juice, ginger, garlic,

53:32.180 --> 53:39.540
soy, rice vinegar, honey, and brown sugar.

53:40.580 --> 53:44.260
And great textures from hand chopped lettuces,

53:44.900 --> 53:49.780
crispy wontons, crunchy Asian slaw, and a veggie roll.

53:50.820 --> 53:53.380
Add Zaxby's signature chicken fingers for a salad

53:53.380 --> 53:55.540
that's a perfect combination of the vibrant and the familiar.

53:56.660 --> 53:58.020
The reason I wanted to highlight this,

53:58.020 --> 53:59.540
and it's also for the quote that's coming up after this,

53:59.540 --> 54:00.900
but the reason I wanted to highlight this,

54:00.900 --> 54:03.860
they have not given you folks a list of ingredients.

54:03.860 --> 54:06.740
I want to make sure we're all on the same page here.

54:06.740 --> 54:08.900
You asked what was in the salad,

54:08.900 --> 54:11.860
and Zaxby's turn from its grim work

54:11.860 --> 54:13.060
looked you dead in the eye

54:13.060 --> 54:15.060
and gave you a list of different feelings

54:15.060 --> 54:18.500
that you're going to experience while consuming the salad.

54:18.500 --> 54:21.460
They're describing the salad from your point of view,

54:21.460 --> 54:24.820
not telling you what goes to create the flavors

54:24.820 --> 54:27.300
of sesame, pineapple, orange juice, ginger, garlic, soy,

54:27.300 --> 54:29.220
rice vinegar, honey, and brown sugar.

54:29.220 --> 54:30.900
They just have those flavors.

54:30.900 --> 54:32.660
Well, it's indescribable.

54:32.660 --> 54:34.020
There's so much fluid.

54:36.020 --> 54:36.740
This sounds all right.

54:36.740 --> 54:39.460
It sounds like a nice little Asian salad with chicken on it,

54:39.460 --> 54:42.180
and also there's some sort of spring roll in there,

54:42.180 --> 54:42.900
and that's kind of wild.

54:42.900 --> 54:45.940
But okay, Zaxby's, I'll play it with me.

54:45.940 --> 54:47.940
And I understand there's just a lot

54:47.940 --> 54:49.780
of sort of liquid content in there.

54:49.780 --> 54:53.620
I'm wondering if this is a sort of cold soup, a gazpacho.

54:54.420 --> 54:55.300
So here's the quote,

54:55.300 --> 54:56.580
and I know what you're wondering to yourself.

54:56.580 --> 54:58.740
Why doesn't Zaxby's offer this?

54:58.740 --> 55:01.380
If people love the Zenzation so much,

55:01.380 --> 55:04.500
why doesn't Zaxby's just offer it year round,

55:04.500 --> 55:07.460
like they do with the birthday cake milkshake, for example?

55:08.420 --> 55:09.620
The answer is this.

55:10.100 --> 55:12.260
For the Zenzation, Gamble says,

55:12.900 --> 55:17.540
we use four unique ingredients that must be inventoried,

55:17.540 --> 55:20.100
prepped, and monitored daily.

55:20.100 --> 55:20.600
What?

55:21.460 --> 55:24.180
The build is a different process than our typical salads,

55:24.180 --> 55:25.380
and it requires time.

55:25.380 --> 55:29.540
And it requires training and diligent reinforcement.

55:29.540 --> 55:30.040
What?

55:30.040 --> 55:31.460
Or it'll escape.

55:31.460 --> 55:35.540
Someone said we got a fucking pineapple thief on our hands.

55:35.540 --> 55:38.900
You think we can truck with a fucking salad burglar around?

55:38.900 --> 55:39.860
Scrubble, scrubble.

55:40.820 --> 55:41.700
Scrubble, scrubble.

55:41.700 --> 55:44.100
Give me that rice vinegar.

55:44.100 --> 55:47.860
You got fucking J.K. Simmons to come in

55:47.860 --> 55:50.420
and throw chicken fingers at people

55:50.420 --> 55:53.060
when they didn't diligently make the salad good enough.

55:53.060 --> 55:56.660
But it's worth it, as there's nothing more rewarding

55:56.660 --> 55:58.420
than bringing back a fan favorite

55:58.420 --> 56:00.020
and making our guests happy.

56:00.020 --> 56:02.820
So what they're saying is like, we could do this year round.

56:03.460 --> 56:07.540
It's very hard, and we're tired here at Zaxby's,

56:07.540 --> 56:09.540
and we'd rather not do it all the time.

56:09.540 --> 56:13.460
This is exhausting, what you're asking us to do right now.

56:13.460 --> 56:16.660
You know how big of a favor you're asking us to do

56:16.660 --> 56:19.060
by bringing back this salad, and yet you persist.

56:19.060 --> 56:22.980
It's like, I wish every fast food restaurant

56:22.980 --> 56:24.500
was this upfront about it.

56:24.500 --> 56:26.980
Like yeah, Szechuan sauce is back.

56:26.980 --> 56:28.260
We're not looking forward to it,

56:28.260 --> 56:29.540
because last time we tried this,

56:29.540 --> 56:31.780
a bunch of fucking nerds tried to burn down

56:31.780 --> 56:33.620
13 of our establishments.

56:33.620 --> 56:37.780
So we'll do the Szechuan sauce at great cost to ourselves,

56:37.780 --> 56:40.100
but like somebody brought a fucking sword

56:40.100 --> 56:42.180
into one of our restaurants last time.

56:42.180 --> 56:44.980
So we're not so wild about it, you have to understand.

56:44.980 --> 56:45.780
And those are just the people

56:45.780 --> 56:48.100
that didn't have a concealed carry sword license.

56:48.100 --> 56:50.820
There's probably a lot of undercover swords.

56:50.820 --> 56:53.940
I said they were cosplaying Rick and Morty,

56:53.940 --> 56:56.580
but they had swords, so I don't know, man.

56:56.580 --> 56:59.060
One last note here, Zaxby's does suggest,

56:59.060 --> 57:00.900
I know what you're saying, what about pairing?

57:01.460 --> 57:03.220
The entree with something.

57:03.940 --> 57:06.740
Zaxby's suggests pairing the,

57:06.740 --> 57:09.060
we got the Zamalier over here,

57:09.060 --> 57:11.940
and he suggests pairing the Zenzation salad

57:11.940 --> 57:15.220
with the exclusive Coca-Cola Freestyle mix,

57:15.220 --> 57:16.260
Southern Peach Fizzle.

57:16.260 --> 57:18.980
So in case you're looking for a pairing recommendation,

57:18.980 --> 57:21.700
that is what our Zamalier recommends,

57:21.700 --> 57:23.300
you of course are free to make your own choice.

57:26.180 --> 57:28.260
Okay, I'm gonna find out first of all

57:28.260 --> 57:30.180
what this restaurant is, where it is,

57:30.180 --> 57:31.140
how they do what they do,

57:31.140 --> 57:33.060
and then get one of these very wet salads.

57:33.940 --> 57:35.540
Get one single wet salad.

57:36.340 --> 57:37.700
How about a question, Juice?

57:37.700 --> 57:40.900
The high school in my town is performing Shrek the Musical.

57:41.620 --> 57:42.820
I wanna go see it,

57:42.820 --> 57:46.580
but I have no connections to the high school.

57:46.580 --> 57:49.300
I didn't go there, I don't know any students or parents

57:49.300 --> 57:50.580
of students that attend.

57:50.580 --> 57:51.620
Is it weird for me to go?

57:52.180 --> 57:56.340
How would a late 20s Shrek enthusiast go about doing so?

57:56.980 --> 57:59.460
An all-star in Woodland Park, Colorado.

58:00.500 --> 58:04.820
This is, they're doing it for you.

58:04.820 --> 58:07.300
Yeah, like you are, you just,

58:08.500 --> 58:10.180
is this where we're at, folks?

58:10.180 --> 58:13.140
I know, I'm with you and I understand you,

58:13.140 --> 58:13.700
and I am you.

58:13.700 --> 58:14.900
I get what you're saying, but like...

58:15.540 --> 58:16.980
Well, I don't know the Foo Fighters,

58:16.980 --> 58:19.300
it would be weird if I went to see them in concert.

58:19.300 --> 58:20.340
I don't know the Foo Fighters,

58:20.340 --> 58:22.180
and I don't know any parents of the Foo Fighters.

58:23.060 --> 58:24.980
I'm not making fun of you, I swear to God I'm with you.

58:25.700 --> 58:26.660
I don't know, Dave.

58:28.580 --> 58:32.820
So is it weird if I go see his show as the Foo Fighters?

58:32.820 --> 58:35.780
There is a certain, we have reached the point where

58:36.420 --> 58:37.940
I get that there is a perceived,

58:37.940 --> 58:39.380
and maybe it's not all bad,

58:39.380 --> 58:41.700
perceived like I'm not supposed to be there

58:41.700 --> 58:43.540
unless I'm connected to it feeling.

58:44.340 --> 58:46.020
Oh, high schools are the most, high schools are the most.

58:46.020 --> 58:48.020
Whenever I go, when we went back to Huntington High School,

58:48.020 --> 58:49.060
which is where I went to school

58:49.060 --> 58:51.140
to shoot stuff for the TV show,

58:51.140 --> 58:54.900
there is nothing like being in a school,

58:55.860 --> 58:57.540
even if it's one that you went to,

58:57.540 --> 58:59.300
that makes you feel like,

59:00.180 --> 59:01.300
especially in elementary school

59:01.300 --> 59:03.460
where everything's a little bit littler,

59:03.460 --> 59:07.060
and then you feel like the rampage gorilla,

59:07.060 --> 59:09.540
and you're just smashing through the hallways

59:09.540 --> 59:12.420
of the high school like John Mayer sang about in his song.

59:12.420 --> 59:14.660
He's like, I want to smash through the halls

59:14.660 --> 59:16.100
of my high school.

59:16.100 --> 59:19.220
I'll kick apart all the lockers and desks.

59:19.940 --> 59:23.540
It makes you feel like you're trespassing,

59:23.540 --> 59:24.180
and I get that.

59:24.180 --> 59:26.020
I think that's probably where they're coming from

59:26.020 --> 59:26.580
a little bit.

59:27.380 --> 59:30.820
I think that Shrek, Fiona, the whole gang

59:30.820 --> 59:33.060
would be thrilled to see you at the show.

59:33.700 --> 59:36.180
I think that that would be a delight.

59:36.180 --> 59:38.500
But you make sure you announce as you go in like,

59:38.500 --> 59:40.420
I'm just here because I love Shrek.

59:41.380 --> 59:42.660
Yeah, I love Shrek.

59:42.660 --> 59:43.700
I'm not a student.

59:43.700 --> 59:44.420
Donkey!

59:44.420 --> 59:48.180
What if we're wrong though,

59:48.180 --> 59:52.100
and they show up and it's all high schoolers and you,

59:52.100 --> 59:54.740
and at one point Shrek points in the audience

59:54.740 --> 59:58.740
and he's like, look at that perv.

59:58.740 --> 59:59.460
Interloper.

01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:02.180
Interloper, attack.

01:00:02.180 --> 01:00:04.260
Teens, attack, donkey.

01:00:04.260 --> 01:00:06.340
Maybe you walk up and say, I'm with Shrek.

01:00:07.540 --> 01:00:08.420
I know Shrek.

01:00:08.420 --> 01:00:09.460
Romantically.

01:00:09.460 --> 01:00:12.020
I know, I'm an invited guest of Mr. Shrek.

01:00:13.860 --> 01:00:15.700
I am Shrek.

01:00:16.340 --> 01:00:18.900
I'll be playing Shrek this evening.

01:00:18.900 --> 01:00:20.340
Oh, that's fun.

01:00:20.340 --> 01:00:21.940
So those stairs next to the stage,

01:00:21.940 --> 01:00:25.060
anybody can just go up those and say like,

01:00:25.060 --> 01:00:26.340
do you guys have a Shrek for tonight?

01:00:26.340 --> 01:00:27.940
Because I'd like to throw my hat in the ring.

01:00:27.940 --> 01:00:28.900
Yeah, I'd like to be,

01:00:29.780 --> 01:00:31.060
I heard you guys were doing Shrek,

01:00:31.060 --> 01:00:32.900
so I was just seeing if I could sign up to be Shrek.

01:00:32.900 --> 01:00:34.820
You just have to put a quarter on the edge of the stage

01:00:34.820 --> 01:00:36.660
to indicate that you have next.

01:00:36.660 --> 01:00:37.780
I'm next on Shrek.

01:00:37.780 --> 01:00:39.300
I'm next on Shrek.

01:00:39.300 --> 01:00:41.220
But listen, I will not eat a bug.

01:00:42.740 --> 01:00:44.260
I will not eat a bug and I don't want

01:00:44.260 --> 01:00:46.900
that goddamn scene-stealing donkey up here with me.

01:00:47.700 --> 01:00:49.540
I'll turn my earwax into a candle.

01:00:49.540 --> 01:00:51.300
I will wash my teeth with slime.

01:00:51.300 --> 01:00:52.660
I will not eat a fucking bug.

01:00:54.020 --> 01:00:55.460
Or a parfait.

01:00:55.460 --> 01:00:56.260
I don't like them,

01:00:56.260 --> 01:00:58.740
which makes you perfect for the role of Shrek.

01:00:58.740 --> 01:01:00.340
I'm not gonna eat a slime parfait

01:01:00.340 --> 01:01:01.620
because I'm a dentist in this town.

01:01:01.620 --> 01:01:02.500
People know who I am.

01:01:02.500 --> 01:01:03.460
They won't come see me.

01:01:04.740 --> 01:01:06.100
You try to get me up here to eat a bug.

01:01:06.100 --> 01:01:07.060
You trying to embarrass me?

01:01:07.060 --> 01:01:08.020
I'm running for mayor.

01:01:09.940 --> 01:01:12.420
Hey, I have a Yahoo Hero that we can do real fast.

01:01:12.420 --> 01:01:12.900
Yeah.

01:01:12.900 --> 01:01:14.100
Sent in by Brooks Oglesby.

01:01:14.100 --> 01:01:15.140
Thanks, Brooks.

01:01:15.140 --> 01:01:16.580
It's Yahoo Answers user.

01:01:17.700 --> 01:01:18.660
Maybe this one will load.

01:01:19.220 --> 01:01:20.980
Sawyer Babe asks,

01:01:22.020 --> 01:01:23.780
why is it called The Breakfast Club?

01:01:24.580 --> 01:01:26.740
What does the title have to do with the movie?

01:01:26.740 --> 01:01:27.220
Thank you.

01:01:28.260 --> 01:01:28.820
Thank you.

01:01:29.460 --> 01:01:30.180
They eat lunch.

01:01:30.180 --> 01:01:32.900
It's in the movie because at the end,

01:01:32.900 --> 01:01:36.980
Anthony Michael Hall signs their essay as The Breakfast Club.

01:01:36.980 --> 01:01:37.540
But why?

01:01:37.540 --> 01:01:38.420
That's fine.

01:01:38.420 --> 01:01:40.260
But why, Anthony?

01:01:40.260 --> 01:01:41.460
There's not a scene, I don't think.

01:01:41.460 --> 01:01:43.140
There is a scene where they think eat-

01:01:43.140 --> 01:01:43.780
Lunch.

01:01:43.780 --> 01:01:44.340
Like lunch.

01:01:44.340 --> 01:01:45.060
They eat lunch.

01:01:45.620 --> 01:01:46.740
This should be The Lunch Club.

01:01:47.540 --> 01:01:49.700
It should be The Lunch Club, Travis.

01:01:49.700 --> 01:01:54.820
There's not a scene where Molly Ringwald pulls out a bagel.

01:01:54.820 --> 01:01:56.580
There's a scene where they smoke a bunch of weed.

01:01:56.580 --> 01:01:57.540
They could be The Weed Club.

01:01:58.500 --> 01:01:59.620
They could be The Weed Club.

01:01:59.620 --> 01:02:01.060
They could be The Problems Club.

01:02:01.780 --> 01:02:03.300
The Bad Family.

01:02:03.300 --> 01:02:04.900
The Bad Family Crew.

01:02:05.540 --> 01:02:07.780
But they don't breakfast at any point.

01:02:07.780 --> 01:02:08.900
It's so weird.

01:02:09.460 --> 01:02:11.620
What if it turned out that that's why they were all in detention?

01:02:11.620 --> 01:02:14.740
Because outside of the detention thing,

01:02:14.740 --> 01:02:16.580
they are all in a club called The Breakfast Club

01:02:16.580 --> 01:02:19.140
where they would just get together and talk about breakfast.

01:02:19.140 --> 01:02:22.180
And one day they did that in a room where they weren't supposed to.

01:02:22.180 --> 01:02:23.460
And it's like, well, you have detention.

01:02:23.460 --> 01:02:25.940
And that backstory part is just never mentioned in the movie.

01:02:27.060 --> 01:02:27.540
Okay.

01:02:27.540 --> 01:02:28.040
Okay.

01:02:29.220 --> 01:02:32.260
I have some news.

01:02:32.260 --> 01:02:34.820
The original title of The Breakfast Club was The Lunch Bunch.

01:02:35.460 --> 01:02:36.900
That's a much better title.

01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:37.700
That's okay.

01:02:37.700 --> 01:02:38.740
That doesn't change the-

01:02:38.740 --> 01:02:41.060
That doesn't nullify us talking about it

01:02:41.060 --> 01:02:45.300
because they purposefully saw the off ramp and didn't get on it.

01:02:45.300 --> 01:02:47.060
And they're like, oh shit, what's the next off ramp?

01:02:47.060 --> 01:02:48.260
Breakfast, okay, oops.

01:02:48.260 --> 01:02:52.100
Do you think the problem was The Lunch Bunch just sounds too dang whimsical?

01:02:52.100 --> 01:02:56.580
And everyone's like, this sounds like a wacky spring break.

01:02:56.580 --> 01:02:58.180
Who's gonna get laid sex comedy?

01:02:58.180 --> 01:02:59.940
And then you get in there and it's like, oh no.

01:03:00.660 --> 01:03:01.940
They're talking about their problems.

01:03:01.940 --> 01:03:02.900
Serious family stuff.

01:03:03.620 --> 01:03:06.980
This is like if they called Forrest Gump like Jumping Man.

01:03:06.980 --> 01:03:07.780
Or Running Man.

01:03:07.780 --> 01:03:10.740
And he doesn't jump as much.

01:03:10.740 --> 01:03:12.820
It's not very much like a part of the...

01:03:13.380 --> 01:03:16.660
Thank you, Travis, for not really understanding the premise.

01:03:16.660 --> 01:03:19.380
I just wanted to make a joke because Running Man is already a movie.

01:03:19.380 --> 01:03:24.180
It does seem kind of like they filmed the whole movie

01:03:24.180 --> 01:03:26.100
and they didn't know what they were gonna call it.

01:03:26.100 --> 01:03:30.900
And someone's just like, can you pretend like we've said Breakfast Club a lot, Anthony?

01:03:30.900 --> 01:03:32.820
Can you pretend like we said Breakfast Club a lot during the movie

01:03:32.820 --> 01:03:34.900
and just kind of end it like that in a real confident way?

01:03:34.900 --> 01:03:36.020
Maybe it was a flood.

01:03:36.020 --> 01:03:38.420
Maybe he was supposed to say Lunch Club and he said Breakfast Club,

01:03:38.420 --> 01:03:40.340
but it was the only clean take they got.

01:03:40.340 --> 01:03:43.300
He was so hungry they filmed that last scene at eight o'clock.

01:03:43.300 --> 01:03:44.900
He hadn't had his yogurt.

01:03:44.900 --> 01:03:47.060
Or maybe they were gonna call it Lunch Bunch,

01:03:47.060 --> 01:03:48.420
but then when they were filming the movie,

01:03:48.420 --> 01:03:51.300
they were like, there's a possibility we can make this a trilogy.

01:03:52.660 --> 01:03:53.620
Yes.

01:03:53.620 --> 01:03:54.120
Yes.

01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:55.320
Yes.

01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:55.960
It's not too late.

01:03:55.960 --> 01:03:57.640
That actually makes a lot of sense.

01:03:57.640 --> 01:04:00.760
We can still make Lunch Bunch and Dinner Winners.

01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:01.560
It's about PUBG.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:07.000
The gang is there and they're playing PUBG together.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:08.440
He's one hit, Emilio.

01:04:08.440 --> 01:04:08.940
Push.

01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:13.640
Folks, that is gonna do it for us this week.

01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:14.600
Thank you so much.

01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:19.960
One last push, and I do mean last because we won't be with you again before the drive is over.

01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:23.000
My maximumfund.org forward slash donate.

01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:28.600
If you like our show and it makes you feel good to listen to it and you'd like to support it

01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:32.200
and support us in making more stuff, that's the address.

01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:37.640
Or and supporting like all the shows on the network or the ones that you listen to

01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:41.720
because that is an important point that your donation portion of it goes to Maximum Fund

01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:47.560
to help pay for their great staff and they make our lives so much easier day in, day out.

01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:51.480
But also like you choose the shows that you listen to when you sign up

01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:53.960
and those are the shows that get your money.

01:04:53.960 --> 01:04:55.240
They split it up.

01:04:55.240 --> 01:04:58.280
So like it's really important that you choose what shows you listen to,

01:04:58.280 --> 01:05:01.560
but know that you are funding those shows.

01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:04.840
You are part of the team of those shows, if you will.

01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:14.840
Yeah, it's again, like it means a lot to us and we can't imagine like doing this anywhere else.

01:05:14.840 --> 01:05:19.000
The Maximum Fund network has been a home for us for eight years now

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:22.520
and has given us so much and you all have given us so much.

01:05:23.560 --> 01:05:26.680
And if you're new or you've been consuming more content,

01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:28.920
just think about going to maximumfund.org slash donate

01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:32.280
and helping us hit that 25,000 new and upgrading member goal.

01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:34.360
And yeah, thank you so much.

01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:35.320
Thank you so much.

01:05:35.320 --> 01:05:37.880
Thank you so much and thanks to John Roderick in the long winters

01:05:37.880 --> 01:05:40.520
for the use of our theme song, It's a Departure, off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:47.240
It was so great, so great to have that and still is great.

01:05:47.240 --> 01:05:50.680
And thank you to Al Roker for-

01:05:50.680 --> 01:05:51.240
Everything.

01:05:51.240 --> 01:05:51.720
Everything.

01:05:52.280 --> 01:05:52.920
You know what?

01:05:52.920 --> 01:05:53.960
No, thanks to Al Roker.

01:05:53.960 --> 01:05:55.560
I'm tired of supplicating myself.

01:05:55.560 --> 01:05:57.320
He did me dirty out there.

01:05:57.320 --> 01:05:58.600
Thanks to Corey Cott.

01:05:58.600 --> 01:05:59.240
How about that?

01:05:59.240 --> 01:05:59.720
Yeah.

01:05:59.720 --> 01:06:07.480
Thanks to Matt Doyle for not being there, but for being there.

01:06:07.480 --> 01:06:08.680
Always being there.

01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:09.480
Also real quick.

01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:14.280
So our Dallas and Houston shows are coming up this weekend when you hear this.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.400
And there are still some tickets left available, especially Houston.

01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:20.040
Houston, where are you, Houston?

01:06:20.040 --> 01:06:22.360
Houston, please.

01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:24.600
Houston, Houston, we have a problem.

01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:25.880
Please.

01:06:29.560 --> 01:06:32.920
Make sure to put in the subject line like Dallas show or Houston show.

01:06:33.560 --> 01:06:39.400
Also, I've got another Cincinnati Underground Society show coming up April 28th.

01:06:39.400 --> 01:06:40.520
The tickets are on sale now.

01:06:40.520 --> 01:06:44.760
You can get those at bit.ly KUSKEY 2018.

01:06:44.760 --> 01:06:48.440

01:06:48.440 --> 01:06:53.080
We had a real blast at last month's show and I hope to see you out at this month's show.

01:06:53.080 --> 01:06:55.720
Bit.ly slash KUSKEY 2018.

01:06:57.960 --> 01:06:58.200
Yeah.

01:06:58.200 --> 01:07:01.480
And also the May shows are going to come up sooner than you think.

01:07:01.480 --> 01:07:03.080
So send in questions for those too.

01:07:03.960 --> 01:07:07.160
Speaking of May, we're going to be doing Sawbones,

01:07:07.160 --> 01:07:13.160
Still Buffering, and Court Appointed at the Columbus Podcast Festival on Saturday, May 12th.

01:07:13.160 --> 01:07:13.960
You can get tickets.

01:07:15.080 --> 01:07:16.600
The link is hard for me to find.

01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:19.320
But if you Google, you will find the way to get tickets.

01:07:19.320 --> 01:07:22.040
I don't have a punchy Bit.ly link like Travis.

01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:22.680
Oh, come on.

01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:24.440
I'm sorry, Trav.

01:07:24.440 --> 01:07:25.560
I'm just, I just can't.

01:07:25.560 --> 01:07:26.360
I just don't have one.

01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:28.520
But yeah, we're going to be doing those three shows back to back to back

01:07:28.520 --> 01:07:29.720
because if you come see us, it'll be fun.

01:07:30.520 --> 01:07:33.560
I need Yahoo's also for the live shows, please.

01:07:33.560 --> 01:07:34.680
Please get them in.

01:07:34.680 --> 01:07:34.920
Thank you.

01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:35.400
Thanks, Warriors.

01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:36.440
All right.

01:07:36.440 --> 01:07:37.080
Finally, Yahoo.

01:07:37.080 --> 01:07:39.320
This one was sent in by Merritt Palmer.

01:07:39.320 --> 01:07:39.800
Thank you, Merritt.

01:07:39.800 --> 01:07:41.800
It's Yahoo Answers user, Ashley, who asks,

01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:49.480
Hey, how do I get the wax covering on Babybel cheese out of my ear?

01:07:52.760 --> 01:07:53.880
My name is Justin McElroy.

01:07:53.880 --> 01:07:55.480
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:07:55.480 --> 01:07:56.680
I'm Griffin McElroy.

01:07:56.680 --> 01:07:57.880
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

01:07:57.880 --> 01:08:07.480
Kiss your dad square on the lips.
