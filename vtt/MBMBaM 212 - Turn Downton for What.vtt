00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:46.560
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me,

00:46.560 --> 00:52.640
an advice show for the modern era. I am Groot. I'm the Rocket Raccoon.

00:53.440 --> 00:57.040
I'm Dave Bautista, everybody's favorite wrestler, America's wrestler,

00:57.040 --> 01:02.880
and a movie for some goddamn reason now. Welcome to Guardians of the Galaxy Watch 2014.

01:02.880 --> 01:07.920
We've got Guardians fever here. We're camped out outside the theater for-

01:07.920 --> 01:11.280
Brr, it's cold. Brr, hell, we've been waiting for so long.

01:11.280 --> 01:14.080
They keep telling us to come in and that the movie started playing,

01:14.080 --> 01:15.840
but we're not ready yet. We're not ready yet.

01:15.840 --> 01:18.480
The anticipation is building. I need to find out,

01:18.480 --> 01:22.720
I need to maybe read a comic book, find out why there's a goddamn talking raccoon in this film.

01:22.720 --> 01:26.400
I need to ask somebody who's already seen it if it has a supernatural ending,

01:26.400 --> 01:29.840
because I find that unsettling. I need to know if any dogs die in the movie.

01:29.840 --> 01:33.520
From what I understand, there wasn't originally going to be a raccoon in the movie,

01:33.520 --> 01:37.680
but Bradley Cooper really wanted to be in, and it was the only place they could think to put him.

01:37.680 --> 01:41.200
Sure, I'll be in your comic book when I shoot pictures is one rule, though.

01:41.200 --> 01:44.800
I've always wanted to be a raccoon. One thing I did enjoy-

01:44.800 --> 01:47.600
I want to stand on wooden Vin Diesel's shoulders, please.

01:48.160 --> 01:52.640
One thing I super did enjoy about Guardians of the Galaxy is that it is lighthearted,

01:52.640 --> 01:57.360
intergalactic action, but it does start with a cancer deathbed scene.

01:57.360 --> 01:57.920
Yep, pretty sweet.

01:57.920 --> 02:02.480
So you do need to go ahead and pay that toll to get on the fun train.

02:03.520 --> 02:08.400
That should be the start of the Run-P article, like, you can skip the first three bummer minutes.

02:08.960 --> 02:13.440
You must be this sad to ride this roller coaster of a Marvel motion picture.

02:13.440 --> 02:17.680
It's funny man Chris Pratt out of the can with his dead mom.

02:17.680 --> 02:23.280
I just think, I wonder if I'm feeling like maybe as a nation,

02:23.280 --> 02:27.680
we think Guardians of the Galaxy is fun because it swoops you down.

02:27.680 --> 02:32.400
It's sort of a George the Jungle action, swooping down into the jungle floor,

02:32.400 --> 02:34.640
then proudly swooping out of it.

02:34.640 --> 02:41.760
The upturn is what makes it seem so fun because they coded the first three minutes in bummer sauce.

02:41.760 --> 02:47.840
I think if you actually go back and you watch up and you watch past the first 15 minutes,

02:47.840 --> 02:51.680
you skip those first 15 minutes, you're like, what a fucking boring movie.

02:51.680 --> 02:53.920
It's just a little boy and it's just an old man.

02:53.920 --> 02:56.800
And they're walking very slowly through the jungle.

02:56.800 --> 02:57.680
Who gives a shit?

02:57.680 --> 02:59.040
Give me my space robots.

02:59.040 --> 03:01.680
Give me my underwater oceanic adventures.

03:01.680 --> 03:02.880
Give me my Incredibles.

03:02.880 --> 03:06.880
It is absolutely true that without the first three minutes of the Guardians of the Galaxy movie,

03:06.880 --> 03:08.560
it's just not that action packed.

03:08.560 --> 03:09.520
It's pretty boring.

03:09.520 --> 03:14.320
There's no, now that I think about it, if I can like cut that part away,

03:14.320 --> 03:16.720
I don't think there's a single fight scene in the whole movie.

03:16.720 --> 03:18.720
Travis, which Guardian are you?

03:19.280 --> 03:20.720
God, I would say I'm a Carrie.

03:20.720 --> 03:24.880
It's Griffin.

03:25.840 --> 03:26.960
Stupid, bonk ass.

03:27.840 --> 03:29.200
Griffin, what about you?

03:29.200 --> 03:30.720
I didn't get Travis's joke.

03:30.720 --> 03:32.000
It's a Sex and the City.

03:34.960 --> 03:37.840
That's what I love, those two minute delay jokes.

03:37.840 --> 03:40.240
Nice slow burn.

03:41.120 --> 03:42.560
Mine's not gonna be as funny as Travis's.

03:42.560 --> 03:44.400
So should we just start with doing the advice?

03:44.400 --> 03:47.280
Yeah, let's just do the advice if you're not gonna be able to top it.

03:48.240 --> 03:50.160
The DM for my Pathfinder.

03:51.200 --> 03:51.680
Fuck yeah.

03:51.680 --> 03:52.240
What?

03:52.240 --> 03:52.880
No, come on.

03:53.760 --> 03:54.400
Okay.

03:54.400 --> 03:55.120
Let's get it wet.

03:55.760 --> 03:56.560
The DM.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.120
Dungeon Master.

03:59.120 --> 04:02.080
District Manager for my Pathfinder.

04:03.200 --> 04:04.640
It's a role playing game.

04:04.640 --> 04:04.960
Group.

04:04.960 --> 04:07.840
Just a group.

04:07.840 --> 04:09.600
Group is just like an assembly of people.

04:11.760 --> 04:13.120
More than one person.

04:13.120 --> 04:14.720
It's hitting on me very aggressively.

04:14.720 --> 04:15.200
In game?

04:16.480 --> 04:18.640
Regardless, it's unacceptable.

04:18.640 --> 04:20.400
I'm not interested for a few reasons,

04:20.400 --> 04:23.360
the least of which being her track record in dating.

04:23.360 --> 04:26.640
The worst is that she is recently dating another member of our Pathfinder group.

04:26.640 --> 04:28.160
Okay, so this is her.

04:28.160 --> 04:30.240
So she has a very limited scope.

04:30.240 --> 04:30.480
Yeah.

04:30.480 --> 04:35.680
How do I let her down and not get killed off in our next glorious adventure?

04:35.680 --> 04:39.840
That's from Dungeons and Dragons and why is your hand on my thigh?

04:39.840 --> 04:41.920
Oh, this is the greatest question.

04:41.920 --> 04:45.360
And they attached, just so you know, the question asker is a dude.

04:45.360 --> 04:46.400
DM is a woman.

04:46.400 --> 04:46.880
Okay.

04:48.480 --> 04:49.520
Clarifying Travis.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.040
Not that it matters.

04:51.040 --> 04:53.520
Not that it matters, but they felt the need to include that information.

04:53.520 --> 04:54.320
Thank you.

04:54.320 --> 04:54.880
Oh man.

04:56.160 --> 04:57.040
That's the thing, right?

04:57.040 --> 05:02.720
Because we could, here's, when you introduce fantasy into the compound,

05:02.720 --> 05:05.120
then our regular advice no longer works.

05:05.120 --> 05:07.600
Because we could say, we could tell you like all the things to do,

05:07.600 --> 05:11.280
like be frank, be upfront, be stern, but be gentle.

05:11.280 --> 05:13.440
Float like a butterfly, break up like a bee.

05:13.440 --> 05:16.240
But at the same time, you can do that and you can take all the right steps,

05:16.240 --> 05:17.520
all the necessary precautions.

05:17.520 --> 05:21.920
And then all of a sudden, maybe those goblins start rolling a few more critical hits on you.

05:21.920 --> 05:22.960
Mm-hmm.

05:22.960 --> 05:29.760
Maybe to jump that spike trap, maybe that requires a DC 20.

05:29.760 --> 05:33.200
Oh, you had to roll a 46 on that charisma check.

05:33.200 --> 05:36.160
Ooh, seems like you only rolled a 44.

05:36.160 --> 05:39.120
So that is not going to cut it.

05:39.120 --> 05:44.800
You could initiate this flirtation, this relationship,

05:44.800 --> 05:47.920
but I don't know where it stopped.

05:47.920 --> 05:51.280
How do you know when it stopped and when it started?

05:51.280 --> 05:57.520
How do you know where the ka-fabe ends and the relationship itself has begun?

05:57.520 --> 06:02.640
Let me toss the fucking biggest monkey wrench into this machinery.

06:03.680 --> 06:09.600
If for some reason this leads to this person being forced out of the group

06:09.600 --> 06:15.040
or the role-playing group being dissolved entirely,

06:15.040 --> 06:19.680
that fucking sucks because it is super, super hard to find a good group

06:19.680 --> 06:21.680
to play role-playing games with.

06:21.680 --> 06:24.800
Well, oh, then I think right there, you've got a great out.

06:24.800 --> 06:27.360
I think your out is you can say, listen, I think you're great,

06:27.360 --> 06:30.080
especially since she's already dated a member of your group.

06:30.080 --> 06:32.720
I don't want to break up the band.

06:32.720 --> 06:34.640
Yeah, like, listen, I think this is great,

06:34.640 --> 06:37.760
but I just really like our time together as friends playing this game,

06:37.760 --> 06:38.960
and I don't want to complicate that.

06:38.960 --> 06:41.680
And I just really need to focus on Gringot, the warrior, right now.

06:41.680 --> 06:42.160
Yeah.

06:42.160 --> 06:43.520
And I need to do what's best for him.

06:44.320 --> 06:44.560
Sure.

06:44.560 --> 06:46.880
I just need to stand in my truth scroll.

06:46.880 --> 06:47.840
My scroll of truth.

06:47.840 --> 06:48.960
My scroll of truth?

06:48.960 --> 06:51.040
I need to chase my bliss potion?

06:51.040 --> 06:53.680
Man, this is the worst situation, though.

06:53.680 --> 06:55.360
You are, because when you're playing D&D,

06:55.360 --> 06:57.120
you're playing any role-playing game,

06:57.120 --> 07:04.000
your DM possesses a, like, fucking 50 shades of gray level of control over you.

07:04.000 --> 07:04.800
Because you got to.

07:04.800 --> 07:06.560
It's like a trust exercise.

07:06.560 --> 07:07.680
It's improv.

07:07.680 --> 07:09.760
It's I'm going to pretend to be a dwarven rogue,

07:09.760 --> 07:11.440
and I'm going to say some dumb shit,

07:11.440 --> 07:13.440
and I'm going to trust that you're going to interpret that

07:13.440 --> 07:16.000
in these codified role-playing game rules.

07:16.560 --> 07:18.640
And then to add sex to it, man.

07:18.640 --> 07:20.480
Well, I am ready to give a piece of advice

07:20.480 --> 07:22.720
we have never given in the history of this show.

07:22.720 --> 07:23.760
Oh, jeez.

07:23.760 --> 07:25.520
You need to make yourself less attractive.

07:26.560 --> 07:27.600
Oh, man.

07:27.600 --> 07:28.320
You think so?

07:28.320 --> 07:30.640
Maybe leave a little mud in your jerkin'?

07:30.640 --> 07:34.800
I'm saying, like, maybe don't be so careful about that Cheetos dust.

07:34.800 --> 07:35.440
You know what I mean?

07:35.440 --> 07:38.240
Well, you're throwing a lot of shade right now, Travis.

07:38.240 --> 07:41.360
You're casting a lot of dispersions.

07:41.920 --> 07:43.520
Well, I think even better if this is the world's most-

07:43.520 --> 07:45.360
A lot of easy, a lot of low-hanging fruit.

07:45.360 --> 07:45.760
A lot of puns.

07:45.760 --> 07:50.240
If this is the world's most attractive Armani-clad Pathfinder group,

07:50.240 --> 07:53.600
then you have so much more room to fall.

07:53.600 --> 07:55.840
I'm just saying you're magic-missiling down right now.

07:55.840 --> 07:57.440
You need to magic-missile up.

07:57.440 --> 07:58.400
Does that make sense?

07:58.400 --> 08:00.880
So do you think this person needs to become even more attractive?

08:01.600 --> 08:03.200
I'm saying that shouldn't be a factor.

08:03.200 --> 08:04.720
I say, okay, you got-

08:04.720 --> 08:06.400
I mean, ugh, it sucks.

08:06.400 --> 08:07.200
You got to handle it.

08:07.200 --> 08:09.040
There's no other way to handle this situation.

08:09.040 --> 08:10.080
There's exactly-

08:10.080 --> 08:10.720
Well, there's two.

08:10.720 --> 08:11.680
You can pack your bags and move away,

08:11.680 --> 08:14.000
but as we've said, that's unacceptable.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.280
You'll never find another group.

08:15.280 --> 08:15.760
That's it.

08:15.760 --> 08:17.920
I packed my bags and moved away from Cincinnati,

08:17.920 --> 08:19.120
and I left all my fucking-

08:19.680 --> 08:21.840
I left my campaign behind,

08:21.840 --> 08:23.840
and I never found another one ever again.

08:24.800 --> 08:26.960
So you're going to sacrifice that if you make that jump.

08:26.960 --> 08:28.400
A lot of people think that adventure grows on trees.

08:28.400 --> 08:29.600
It does not.

08:29.600 --> 08:30.000
It does not.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.520
Well, adventure doesn't have anything to do with it.

08:31.520 --> 08:34.400
It's more like people who can be fucking cool

08:34.400 --> 08:36.320
while we all pretend to be wizards and shit.

08:36.880 --> 08:39.120
For a minute, can you be cool for a minute?

08:40.880 --> 08:43.920
No, no, no, no, no.

08:43.920 --> 08:47.760
Well, I take the priestess by her waist

08:47.760 --> 08:49.280
and pull her onto my lap.

08:49.280 --> 08:53.040
No, no, no, no, no, no.

08:54.080 --> 08:57.200
I only played, legitimately played D&D once,

08:57.200 --> 09:00.560
and my friend Jason was a dwarf,

09:00.560 --> 09:02.800
and he ran through a dance floor

09:02.800 --> 09:06.240
cutting everyone's Achilles tendon and got us thrown out,

09:06.240 --> 09:07.600
and that was the last time we ever played

09:07.600 --> 09:09.040
because he didn't do it right.

09:10.400 --> 09:11.520
You're not doing it right.

09:11.520 --> 09:14.320
Did you call someone afterwards?

09:14.320 --> 09:18.720
Did you raise some sort of flag with some organization?

09:18.720 --> 09:20.320
Someone should keep an eye on Jason.

09:20.320 --> 09:23.120
Someone just keep them in your prayers.

09:24.560 --> 09:26.160
You gotta be frank and just say,

09:27.120 --> 09:30.400
listen, I'm flattered, but I really like this group,

09:30.400 --> 09:32.400
and I just like hanging out with you

09:32.400 --> 09:34.320
in this very limited scope.

09:34.320 --> 09:35.920
Please continue doing this.

09:35.920 --> 09:38.160
I'll pay you pizza money for DMing.

09:38.160 --> 09:41.520
That's like the standard trade-off, I think,

09:42.880 --> 09:44.720
but I don't wanna go out with you, and I'm sorry.

09:44.720 --> 09:46.320
There's also another option.

09:46.320 --> 09:46.720
Please.

09:46.720 --> 09:49.120
Without knowing how aggressively hitting on you

09:49.120 --> 09:50.480
aggressively means,

09:50.480 --> 09:53.280
you could start scaling back your responses

09:54.080 --> 09:56.080
because right now you're probably playing along

09:56.080 --> 09:56.960
because you're being nice.

09:56.960 --> 09:58.240
You don't wanna embarrass.

09:58.240 --> 09:59.120
No, that's what I'm saying.

09:59.120 --> 10:02.400
You scale it back gradually until eventually

10:03.440 --> 10:06.720
you're not responding to the hitting the same way.

10:06.720 --> 10:10.320
And so that way, like, if she was asking you out,

10:10.320 --> 10:13.200
if she is saying, like, I wanna go out with you,

10:13.200 --> 10:14.480
then yeah, you need to be frank

10:14.480 --> 10:15.840
and you need to be straightforward.

10:15.840 --> 10:17.600
If at this point, it's just like kind of flirting-

10:17.600 --> 10:18.560
How can I be frank?

10:18.560 --> 10:21.600
I'm too busy being Kromlor the barbarian.

10:22.480 --> 10:25.200
I'm not supposed to be Kromlor and frank now?

10:25.200 --> 10:26.080
And Roger.

10:26.800 --> 10:28.560
Me, my real name and life.

10:29.920 --> 10:30.480
Oh boy.

10:31.520 --> 10:31.920
Good luck.

10:31.920 --> 10:34.320
That's how you end up with some mazes and monster shit.

10:34.320 --> 10:36.640
Yeah, you're gonna find yourself in the tomb of horrors

10:37.600 --> 10:38.640
of love.

10:38.640 --> 10:41.200
The tomb of horrors and also love at the same time.

10:41.200 --> 10:41.840
Horror love.

10:42.480 --> 10:43.440
Fuck, I wanna play Dungeons.

10:43.440 --> 10:45.520
Can we please play Dungeons and Dragons, us,

10:45.520 --> 10:46.240
and record it?

10:47.280 --> 10:48.400
Record it and do a podcast.

10:48.400 --> 10:49.360
There's a hunger for it.

10:49.360 --> 10:50.240
There's a need.

10:50.240 --> 10:51.280
The people, they need it.

10:51.280 --> 10:53.200
The people fucking need to hear us play Dungeons.

10:53.200 --> 10:54.240
Griffin, give us the ahu.

10:54.800 --> 10:55.280
I'll do it, yeah.

10:56.080 --> 10:56.720
I like that.

10:56.720 --> 10:57.680
I know, I've never demanded.

10:57.680 --> 10:59.760
I thought I would just take control,

10:59.760 --> 11:01.840
DM this podcast.

11:01.840 --> 11:02.480
Pretty forceful.

11:02.480 --> 11:04.800
Somebody better.

11:04.800 --> 11:07.520
How about a yahoo from Troy Hoffmacle.

11:07.520 --> 11:08.480
Thank you, Troy.

11:08.480 --> 11:12.480
It's by a suspended yahoo answers user who asks,

11:14.400 --> 11:17.360
could an octopus fire a handgun?

11:18.400 --> 11:21.040
If an octopus could understand a handgun's function

11:21.040 --> 11:22.960
and this handgun could work underwater,

11:22.960 --> 11:24.800
would the octopus have sufficient strength

11:24.800 --> 11:28.560
and motor control in a tentacle to hold, aim, and fire?

11:28.560 --> 11:32.240
Assume a gun with a mass of around one and a half pounds

11:32.240 --> 11:35.440
or seven tenths of a kilo

11:35.440 --> 11:38.160
and any sort of octopus you like.

11:38.160 --> 11:41.520
Bonus marks, would it be strong enough to do so above water?

11:43.600 --> 11:47.120
Well, I think that there is one factor of this question

11:47.120 --> 11:49.680
that I think is assuming and I don't like it.

11:49.680 --> 11:50.160
What's that?

11:51.040 --> 11:54.080
That the octopus has to understand how the gun works.

11:54.080 --> 11:55.840
I think it's a way more terrifying

11:55.840 --> 11:58.400
and much more pressing situation to say like,

11:58.400 --> 12:01.840
I accidentally dropped my handgun into my octopus tank.

12:01.840 --> 12:02.240
Yeah.

12:02.240 --> 12:04.640
Do I need to evacuate the building?

12:04.640 --> 12:04.880
Yeah.

12:05.520 --> 12:07.520
No, I mean, but I think it would be way scarier

12:07.520 --> 12:11.120
if the octopus not only had motive, right?

12:11.120 --> 12:14.880
I think I see an octopus and I just naturally think

12:14.880 --> 12:18.800
like that's an animal that like wants to kill humans.

12:18.800 --> 12:19.360
Yes.

12:19.360 --> 12:23.680
And I guess maybe that's my own like Lovecraftian prejudice.

12:23.680 --> 12:26.800
No, it's nature's purest form of evil.

12:26.800 --> 12:27.300
Right.

12:27.300 --> 12:33.300
I think a octopus that has that malice, that motive,

12:33.300 --> 12:37.140
but also the know-how to fire upon me.

12:37.140 --> 12:39.300
And then like, okay, you have a gun.

12:39.300 --> 12:42.980
An octopus has a gun and you're facing off high noon.

12:45.220 --> 12:48.500
Holy shit, can you imagine like hearing a whistle

12:48.500 --> 12:50.260
or it could click and turning around

12:50.260 --> 12:54.020
and just seeing an octopus just like standing full height

12:54.020 --> 12:56.340
with like two tentacles out holding a gun.

12:56.340 --> 12:58.820
Or six guns in six tentacles.

12:58.820 --> 12:59.060
Okay.

12:59.060 --> 13:00.980
I actually would not be intimidated

13:00.980 --> 13:03.780
by an octopus holding one to two guns

13:03.780 --> 13:05.700
because my assumption is going to be,

13:05.700 --> 13:07.860
well, he doesn't even know how to get more guns.

13:07.860 --> 13:08.100
Right.

13:08.100 --> 13:10.260
If he had six arms, he would have six guns.

13:10.260 --> 13:10.980
He would do that.

13:10.980 --> 13:13.540
I mean, the fucking gun control in this country

13:13.540 --> 13:15.140
is such a goddamn joke that an octopus

13:15.140 --> 13:17.300
probably could buy six guns without a-

13:17.300 --> 13:19.860
Blurrble, blurrble, blurrble, blurrble.

13:19.860 --> 13:22.500
Just please, it's going to be a three-day wait.

13:22.500 --> 13:23.380
Blurrble, blurrble, blurrble, blurrble.

13:23.380 --> 13:24.740
I don't know if we can-

13:24.740 --> 13:26.100
All right, come on out back.

13:26.100 --> 13:29.220
In Octodad's dark sequel, that'll be the opening scene.

13:30.260 --> 13:31.380
Octodad's revenge.

13:32.100 --> 13:34.900
But you're facing off against this motherfucker,

13:35.460 --> 13:40.260
this slimy cephalopod motherfucker.

13:40.260 --> 13:42.420
Where do you shoot that thing?

13:42.420 --> 13:42.980
In the beak.

13:43.780 --> 13:44.740
You can't see his beak.

13:44.740 --> 13:45.780
His beak is not exposed.

13:45.780 --> 13:49.300
It will be exposed after he kills you and engulfs you.

13:49.300 --> 13:52.820
But until then, the beak, his weak point is not exposed.

13:52.820 --> 13:54.260
Well, I will say this.

13:54.260 --> 13:56.500
I don't know much about encephalopods,

13:56.500 --> 13:59.460
but I'm almost certain their entire body is their weak point.

13:59.460 --> 14:00.740
They're pretty jelly-filled.

14:00.740 --> 14:01.940
They're jelly-filled, Travis,

14:01.940 --> 14:04.180
but if you shoot it in the jelly, is that going to stop it?

14:04.180 --> 14:04.740
No.

14:04.740 --> 14:08.100
I'm saying you can easily penetrate its rind,

14:08.740 --> 14:10.580
but is that going to do any fucking damage?

14:10.580 --> 14:12.100
You're not going to be able to shoot those tentacles off.

14:12.100 --> 14:13.860
He probably tried to run a scam on you.

14:13.860 --> 14:15.860
You hid it in the ink sac.

14:15.860 --> 14:17.300
Ink started squirting everywhere.

14:17.300 --> 14:18.660
He's like, oh, you got me.

14:18.660 --> 14:20.500
Look, there's black blood everywhere.

14:20.500 --> 14:23.060
I'm dying. Come over here and check out my-

14:23.060 --> 14:23.940
Come check out my blood.

14:25.780 --> 14:26.980
You shot the ink sac.

14:28.020 --> 14:29.460
My blood is red.

14:29.460 --> 14:31.860
Red is blood of humans.

14:31.860 --> 14:34.740
The drink is my sole source of sustenance.

14:34.740 --> 14:37.940
I think that we are confusing octopuses and squids.

14:37.940 --> 14:39.780
What can I care less?

14:39.780 --> 14:40.420
Fair enough.

14:40.420 --> 14:41.860
They're basically the same thing,

14:41.860 --> 14:44.260
and I don't want to hear from any marine biologists out there,

14:44.260 --> 14:46.020
but they're basically the same animal, right?

14:46.020 --> 14:47.460
Many legs, weird bodies.

14:47.460 --> 14:48.420
They swim in the water.

14:48.420 --> 14:50.340
I'm saying eyes.

14:51.380 --> 14:51.940
What is also scary?

14:51.940 --> 14:52.740
Mustaches.

14:52.740 --> 14:53.940
They're the same thing.

14:53.940 --> 14:54.420
You know.

14:55.300 --> 14:56.020
What is scarier?

14:56.020 --> 14:57.060
Never pick up the check.

14:57.620 --> 14:59.460
Eight arms can't pick up a check.

14:59.460 --> 15:00.500
That's cool.

15:00.500 --> 15:03.540
Suckers covered in suckers,

15:03.540 --> 15:05.620
covered in sticky appendages,

15:05.620 --> 15:06.900
cannot pick up that check, though.

15:08.100 --> 15:08.820
If you say so.

15:09.540 --> 15:10.980
They are tender lovers, though.

15:10.980 --> 15:11.780
They are.

15:11.780 --> 15:12.340
Fuck.

15:12.340 --> 15:13.140
No, they're not.

15:13.140 --> 15:15.460
They don't know, but you can't spurn them

15:15.460 --> 15:17.780
or they will shoot you six times at once.

15:17.780 --> 15:19.860
That song, I just died in your arms tonight,

15:19.860 --> 15:21.780
it's about somebody who had sex with an octopus

15:21.780 --> 15:23.540
and literally was killed by their arms

15:23.540 --> 15:25.380
because they love to kill humans more than anything.

15:26.740 --> 15:28.740
Octopuses are the anti-horse.

15:29.460 --> 15:31.780
Oh, are we making a fucking statement right now?

15:32.580 --> 15:33.300
If that's the truth,

15:33.300 --> 15:34.580
if that's the truth,

15:34.580 --> 15:36.580
then based on that syllogism,

15:37.140 --> 15:38.100
we have to never...

15:38.100 --> 15:41.300
They are to be the forbidden animal.

15:41.940 --> 15:44.820
They are to be a cursed animal

15:44.820 --> 15:47.700
of which we can never speak again after this segment.

15:47.700 --> 15:49.940
Are manatees the horse of the ocean?

15:49.940 --> 15:50.900
No, stop it.

15:50.900 --> 15:51.380
Seahorse.

15:51.380 --> 15:52.180
They're a cow.

15:52.180 --> 15:54.420
I think seahorses would probably be the horse of the ocean

15:54.420 --> 15:56.500
since that's got sea and then horse.

15:56.500 --> 16:00.980
Yeah, and they also reproduce asexually like horses.

16:00.980 --> 16:01.460
Fair enough.

16:02.100 --> 16:04.100
And great wishes if you catch them.

16:04.100 --> 16:04.660
Exactly.

16:04.660 --> 16:07.380
My high school was a small private college prep

16:07.380 --> 16:09.940
and pretty close-knit, about 100 people per class.

16:09.940 --> 16:11.620
We have a big alumni program.

16:11.620 --> 16:14.100
My first five-year class reunion is coming up.

16:14.100 --> 16:19.140
Of course, I want to show off my success in the business world,

16:19.140 --> 16:21.140
but I don't want to look like a total prick.

16:21.140 --> 16:21.460
All right.

16:21.460 --> 16:24.020
The high school is very strict with uniforms and dress codes,

16:24.660 --> 16:27.060
so should my attire be more professional?

16:27.060 --> 16:28.580
I need your help, brothers.

16:28.580 --> 16:30.980
It's from Jaded in Jacksonville.

16:30.980 --> 16:32.420
I do not understand.

16:32.420 --> 16:34.500
Are you asking us for fucking fashion advice?

16:35.300 --> 16:37.940
I think you have two options in this scenario.

16:37.940 --> 16:43.620
You know, full-on like black tie or like white suit,

16:43.620 --> 16:45.460
you know, Monte Carlo kind of shit,

16:46.020 --> 16:48.580
or just like, uh, shorts and a t-shirt.

16:48.580 --> 16:49.860
Yeah, if only there was something in bet-

16:49.860 --> 16:52.660
If only there were clothes in between those two crazy extremes.

16:52.660 --> 16:54.020
No, you gotta go one way or the other

16:54.020 --> 16:55.300
because you either gotta go,

16:55.300 --> 16:59.220
I'm doing super great, or I don't care what you think of me.

17:00.020 --> 17:01.940
See, it's such a gambit because if I find out

17:01.940 --> 17:05.060
that a super, super rich person is wearing cargo shorts,

17:05.060 --> 17:06.740
that makes me angrier than fuck all.

17:06.740 --> 17:12.580
That's the worst, because it's like, you can afford to dress better.

17:12.580 --> 17:15.380
No, you want to be like me, but you're not like me

17:15.380 --> 17:17.620
because you have so much more money than me.

17:17.620 --> 17:18.580
I'm wearing cargo shorts right now.

17:18.580 --> 17:21.780
What happens when you find out that a really poor person

17:21.780 --> 17:22.980
is wearing a tuxedo?

17:22.980 --> 17:24.340
That makes me angry too, man.

17:24.340 --> 17:25.460
That is bad too.

17:25.460 --> 17:28.420
I think all of our rich people should have to wear finery.

17:28.420 --> 17:29.060
Yeah.

17:29.060 --> 17:30.100
Like all the time.

17:30.100 --> 17:30.980
It should have to be-

17:30.980 --> 17:31.780
Doublets.

17:31.780 --> 17:32.340
Yeah.

17:32.340 --> 17:34.500
Then we'll better know who to mug.

17:34.500 --> 17:35.060
Yeah.

17:35.060 --> 17:35.220
Yeah.

17:35.220 --> 17:36.900
Yeah, that'll make the mugging easier.

17:36.900 --> 17:39.540
Can I tell you how many times I mug a dude in a tuxedo

17:39.540 --> 17:41.940
and he's like, no, I just found this in a dumpster.

17:41.940 --> 17:42.820
And I'm like, fuck.

17:42.820 --> 17:44.820
He does that sad little pocket out turn

17:44.820 --> 17:46.180
and the flies fly out of it.

17:47.380 --> 17:48.980
I lost it all in the stocks.

17:50.260 --> 17:54.420
If I may make a humble suggestion, by my math,

17:55.220 --> 17:57.700
assuming you went to college, you don't mention that,

17:57.700 --> 18:00.820
but by my math, you are one year out of college.

18:01.700 --> 18:05.060
I'm 33 years old and allow me to advise you,

18:05.060 --> 18:10.340
maybe hold off on the braggadocious nature of your plan right now

18:10.340 --> 18:12.980
because maybe some things might change.

18:13.620 --> 18:17.860
I would not get too cocky about thinking you have it all figured out

18:17.860 --> 18:19.700
on your first year out of college.

18:19.700 --> 18:22.420
I'm glad you have had some success there,

18:22.420 --> 18:26.420
but maybe you don't want to be the guy at the 10th annual reunion

18:26.420 --> 18:28.260
who's like, I have nothing.

18:28.260 --> 18:29.300
I lost it all.

18:29.300 --> 18:30.340
I lost it all.

18:30.340 --> 18:31.220
I would also like to-

18:31.220 --> 18:31.860
You deserved it.

18:31.860 --> 18:33.460
You came festooned to the fifth year.

18:33.460 --> 18:37.140
I would like to address the organizers of this reunion as well.

18:37.140 --> 18:38.420
I'm sure they're listening.

18:38.420 --> 18:40.020
A five-year reunion?

18:40.020 --> 18:40.820
That's five.

18:40.820 --> 18:41.940
Hey, how's your life?

18:41.940 --> 18:43.700
Pretty much the fucking same.

18:43.700 --> 18:44.820
Pretty much exactly the same.

18:44.820 --> 18:46.980
Pretty much the same plus five.

18:48.580 --> 18:51.940
I mean, I went to college, but I literally just finished that.

18:51.940 --> 18:52.660
What did you do?

18:52.660 --> 18:54.340
I went to college and you?

18:54.340 --> 18:55.860
I did go to college though.

18:56.420 --> 18:58.980
I grew this mustache, but I'm probably gonna shave it tomorrow

18:58.980 --> 19:00.340
because I don't really like it all that much.

19:00.340 --> 19:01.700
I've only had it for two weeks.

19:01.700 --> 19:02.660
What did you do in college?

19:02.660 --> 19:05.460
I drank bad beer and I had sex and was bad at it.

19:05.460 --> 19:05.780
Cool.

19:05.780 --> 19:06.660
What did you do?

19:06.660 --> 19:09.620
I had bad beer and I did bad sex too.

19:09.620 --> 19:10.500
Also, me.

19:11.060 --> 19:11.540
I did that.

19:11.540 --> 19:13.140
We were roommates, remember?

19:13.140 --> 19:13.620
Remember?

19:13.620 --> 19:15.060
We had sex with each other.

19:15.060 --> 19:18.260
We had sex with each other and then we drink Coors Light.

19:19.380 --> 19:20.740
Because we didn't know any better.

19:20.740 --> 19:21.620
We didn't know what we were doing.

19:21.620 --> 19:22.500
We're children.

19:22.500 --> 19:23.380
We're childs.

19:25.940 --> 19:27.140
But it's been nice catching up.

19:27.140 --> 19:28.180
I'll see you later.

19:28.180 --> 19:29.220
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

19:29.940 --> 19:31.620
My 10-year reunion's coming up.

19:31.620 --> 19:32.260
It's coming up.

19:32.260 --> 19:36.420
They're trying, impotently I would say, to plan it on Facebook.

19:36.420 --> 19:39.300
There's like one person, and maybe this is Universal,

19:39.300 --> 19:40.420
who is like,

19:40.420 --> 19:41.700
is coming up guys!

19:41.700 --> 19:44.420
Let's meet at this fucking roller skating rink

19:44.420 --> 19:45.780
and just like hammer this shit out.

19:46.500 --> 19:48.340
But like all of us went to the same school

19:48.340 --> 19:50.260
because we grew up in a college town.

19:50.260 --> 19:54.900
So it's more like a six-year reunion

19:54.900 --> 19:56.820
for when we all graduated from the same college

19:56.820 --> 19:58.420
that we went to after high school.

19:58.420 --> 19:58.980
Right.

19:58.980 --> 19:59.780
I don't know.

19:59.780 --> 20:03.380
I think 15 is the earliest reunion anyone should go to.

20:03.380 --> 20:05.220
Or deathbed reunion.

20:05.220 --> 20:06.340
Oh yeah.

20:06.340 --> 20:06.820
70.

20:06.820 --> 20:08.500
Oh, you got to hit that point

20:08.500 --> 20:10.980
where your reunion coincides with someone else's.

20:10.980 --> 20:15.380
So like the class of 63 and the class of 2013.

20:15.380 --> 20:15.860
Exactly.

20:15.860 --> 20:17.300
I don't want to know what the fuck

20:17.300 --> 20:19.620
my shithead peers have been up to

20:19.620 --> 20:21.540
for the past five years.

20:21.540 --> 20:23.140
I want to know what to expect

20:23.780 --> 20:27.700
using the education I've received from this institution.

20:27.700 --> 20:30.420
How that's going to carry me through the next 60 or so.

20:30.420 --> 20:31.940
Probably a lot of fear of communism.

20:31.940 --> 20:33.300
Probably a lot of commie stuff.

20:34.100 --> 20:36.660
Whenever I get mad or angry, my nose runs.

20:36.660 --> 20:41.140
I start sniffling and snots want to run all over my face.

20:42.340 --> 20:44.260
For those who know me, it's a dead giveaway,

20:44.260 --> 20:45.540
especially the missus.

20:45.540 --> 20:47.700
It sucks when I'm ironing because my wife and friends

20:47.700 --> 20:50.340
know the moment I get pissed by my snorting.

20:50.340 --> 20:53.620
Even when I tried to blow off the offense, I still snort.

20:53.620 --> 20:55.380
So even though I try to let things drop,

20:55.380 --> 20:57.380
the boogie stream lets everyone know.

20:57.380 --> 20:58.340
Can we not?

21:00.580 --> 21:02.500
What kind of husband can I be to my wife

21:02.500 --> 21:04.260
if I can't hide my emotions from her?

21:06.500 --> 21:09.060
If you are at a loss, maybe Sydney could help.

21:10.260 --> 21:10.740
All right.

21:10.740 --> 21:11.620
I don't think-

21:11.620 --> 21:13.620
Thanks for that vote of confidence, dude.

21:13.620 --> 21:15.140
I don't think we need to bring Sydney.

21:15.140 --> 21:15.860
This seems sort of-

21:15.860 --> 21:17.460
No, this seems like-

21:17.460 --> 21:18.900
Way below her pay grade.

21:19.620 --> 21:20.180
Yeah.

21:20.180 --> 21:20.980
I, um...

21:23.300 --> 21:24.500
Why are you getting angry?

21:24.500 --> 21:26.660
Why are you getting snotty is the bigger question,

21:26.660 --> 21:28.420
Justin. People get angry.

21:28.420 --> 21:30.420
Is there an eye patch you could wear on your nose?

21:31.380 --> 21:32.660
Yeah, I saw it on Shark Tank.

21:33.620 --> 21:34.260
I would invest in that.

21:34.260 --> 21:36.420
It's supposed to filter out all the bad stuff,

21:36.420 --> 21:40.020
but I bet it could work as some sort of nasal dam,

21:40.020 --> 21:41.540
keeping the mucus at bay.

21:41.540 --> 21:42.740
I mean, you're gonna dry drown.

21:44.500 --> 21:47.460
I mean, dry drowning is a major risk factor there.

21:49.300 --> 21:50.980
This is the weirdest superpower I've ever heard.

21:50.980 --> 21:52.420
Yeah, you're like the shitty Hulk.

21:52.420 --> 21:54.100
You wouldn't like me when I'm angry

21:54.100 --> 21:56.020
if we're recording a podcast together,

21:56.020 --> 21:57.780
because you are going to have to edit out a lot of snorts

21:57.780 --> 21:59.140
and a lot of snorfles.

21:59.140 --> 22:00.740
Can I borrow your handkerchief?

22:00.740 --> 22:01.780
Can I please borrow your hand key?

22:02.500 --> 22:04.820
Please say yes, or else it's just going to get worse.

22:04.820 --> 22:08.100
What happens when this guy has a fucking sinus infection

22:08.100 --> 22:09.060
and everyone's like,

22:09.060 --> 22:14.500
fuck Scott, damn Scott, pump the fucking brakes, dog.

22:14.500 --> 22:16.500
Calm down a little bit, Scott.

22:17.220 --> 22:18.820
Oh, I think we're out of Greek yogurt.

22:18.820 --> 22:22.900
Oh, fuck dog, chill out, it's yogurt.

22:25.460 --> 22:29.220
No, I have an infection thing, I'm not mad.

22:29.860 --> 22:30.660
Can you play?

22:30.660 --> 22:32.660
Okay, then you can play it off, right?

22:32.660 --> 22:34.100
If you get angry and you...

22:36.100 --> 22:38.260
And people are like, here it comes.

22:38.260 --> 22:40.820
Scott, I heard the wage gap is starting to close

22:40.820 --> 22:41.940
between men and women.

22:42.820 --> 22:43.620
Wow, Scott.

22:43.620 --> 22:45.220
Wow, all right, fucking cool.

22:45.220 --> 22:46.420
Oh, that's a good one.

22:46.420 --> 22:50.580
Wow, Scott, okay, jeez.

22:50.580 --> 22:52.660
Here's your fedora, blow your nose into that,

22:52.660 --> 22:54.100
you fucking creep.

22:54.100 --> 22:54.580
Get out.

22:55.300 --> 22:57.620
Can you believe it, our first black president.

22:58.420 --> 22:59.060
Scott!

22:59.060 --> 23:01.460
Scott, come on.

23:01.460 --> 23:07.460
Damn, wow, you think you know somebody, jeez.

23:10.420 --> 23:10.980
Scott?

23:11.700 --> 23:14.820
Scott, I wanted to tell you, I'm pregnant.

23:14.820 --> 23:18.180
Oh, you said you wanted it.

23:18.740 --> 23:20.980
Scott, shit, this sucks, man.

23:20.980 --> 23:23.540
This is like, can this person even play poker?

23:24.100 --> 23:27.140
Like it's like a lifetell.

23:27.140 --> 23:29.300
I feel like we need to start doing like a Sarah McLaughlin

23:29.300 --> 23:32.100
style like commercial for pennies a day.

23:32.100 --> 23:32.420
Yeah.

23:32.420 --> 23:35.300
You could help Scott and his weird runny mad nose.

23:36.660 --> 23:41.140
Scott can't enjoy a moment's peace when playing poker

23:41.140 --> 23:44.180
or fighting with his wife because of his boogie streams.

23:44.180 --> 23:46.820
I'm wondering why this only manifests with anger.

23:46.820 --> 23:48.260
Do you think there are other emotions?

23:48.260 --> 23:51.780
That seems, I mean, it's weird all over.

23:51.780 --> 23:54.580
When he gets happy, he gets a lot of earwax.

23:54.580 --> 23:55.220
Oh God.

23:57.860 --> 24:01.060
If he gets a little upset, just a little belly button lint.

24:02.260 --> 24:04.340
He's asking what kind of husband he can be

24:04.340 --> 24:06.100
if he can't hide his emojis though.

24:07.620 --> 24:08.900
A very honest one.

24:08.900 --> 24:10.500
Yeah, I think that's sort of the way to go.

24:10.500 --> 24:12.420
Why would you want to hide your emojis anyway?

24:12.420 --> 24:15.300
You gotta let those things out or they'll back you up.

24:15.860 --> 24:17.540
This is great because you can say stuff like,

24:17.540 --> 24:19.540
listen, I want you to know that I sniffed.

24:19.540 --> 24:21.140
Not because I was mad at you,

24:21.140 --> 24:22.740
because I was mad at the situation.

24:23.460 --> 24:25.540
And you can be very open and honest with your wife

24:25.540 --> 24:27.860
and take it as an opportunity to let her know

24:27.860 --> 24:29.380
what's really happening inside your head

24:29.380 --> 24:31.140
along with the snot that's above.

24:31.140 --> 24:32.980
Yeah, I think people are going to know what's up in that head.

24:35.780 --> 24:36.980
Let's go to the money zone.

24:36.980 --> 24:38.740
Are you mad that you don't have money?

24:38.740 --> 24:46.660
I'm mad about not having money.

24:50.660 --> 24:52.180
I'm wondering if we should have told that dude

24:52.180 --> 24:53.460
to go to the doctor.

24:53.460 --> 24:54.500
Oh, yeah, yeah, sorry.

24:55.540 --> 24:58.500
Retcon, go to the doctor, Scott, immediately.

24:58.500 --> 25:04.580
Man, I hope Scott is not the sort of that skips the ads

25:04.580 --> 25:06.100
because he will miss that life-saving message.

25:06.100 --> 25:06.660
Yeah, yeah.

25:06.660 --> 25:07.300
Oh, yeah.

25:07.300 --> 25:08.420
He will drown in his nose.

25:08.420 --> 25:09.140
Well, you know what?

25:09.140 --> 25:10.260
That'll fucking teach him.

25:11.300 --> 25:13.220
Yeah, I'm going to say something that's going to surprise you.

25:13.220 --> 25:13.700
What's that?

25:14.420 --> 25:15.620
You should be snacking more.

25:16.660 --> 25:19.700
I feel like, I mean, I'm glad to hear that.

25:19.700 --> 25:21.860
It is, I suppose, a bit surprising.

25:21.860 --> 25:23.380
Did it fucking surprise you?

25:23.380 --> 25:24.980
I suppose it did, yeah.

25:24.980 --> 25:26.820
Ah, so here's the thing.

25:26.820 --> 25:28.740
I've been running into this because I'm trying to lose some weight.

25:28.740 --> 25:30.740
I'm moving out to the California.

25:30.740 --> 25:32.420
I want to get my beach body ready.

25:32.420 --> 25:33.300
Oh, Jesus.

25:33.300 --> 25:35.380
And I'm trying to lose a couple of LBs,

25:36.020 --> 25:37.780
10 or 12 LBs, you know what I mean?

25:37.780 --> 25:40.500
You've got a beach, you've got a beach ball body now.

25:41.220 --> 25:41.940
Oh, Griffin.

25:42.980 --> 25:43.460
And so-

25:44.660 --> 25:46.580
I'm going to laugh every time anyone sniffs now.

25:47.940 --> 25:52.660
And so, you know, the wife and I, we're eating the healthy snacks.

25:52.660 --> 25:53.700
And how are we doing that?

25:53.700 --> 25:54.580
Well, it's a great question.

25:54.580 --> 25:56.100
We're doing it through naturebox.com.

25:57.460 --> 26:02.260
Naturebox.com has tons and tons of options of delicious and healthy snacks.

26:02.260 --> 26:03.860
They're not just good, they're good for you.

26:05.060 --> 26:06.100
They're natural.

26:06.100 --> 26:08.980
What are y'all working with now?

26:08.980 --> 26:12.180
I had some cinnamon sugar, like corn kernels.

26:12.820 --> 26:17.380
Had a little vanilla, macaroon, granola for breakfast.

26:18.740 --> 26:21.060
You can eat snacks for breakfast?

26:21.060 --> 26:22.420
That's correct, Griffin.

26:22.420 --> 26:23.700
Oh, wonderful world we live in.

26:24.340 --> 26:27.300
They also had this, the Big Island pineapple,

26:27.300 --> 26:31.620
where you get like kind of like a dried dehydrated pineapple.

26:31.620 --> 26:32.340
So good.

26:32.340 --> 26:34.020
And that's what I was jamming on breakfast for a while.

26:34.020 --> 26:35.540
That and the peanut butter nom noms,

26:35.540 --> 26:37.460
which I don't actually think those are breakfast,

26:37.460 --> 26:38.660
but I'm still a child.

26:38.660 --> 26:41.780
So I was eating something called peanut butter nom noms for breakfast.

26:41.780 --> 26:42.820
I love that dried fruit thing.

26:42.820 --> 26:43.780
That's some quick energy.

26:43.780 --> 26:44.020
I'm into that.

26:44.020 --> 26:44.500
Yeah, dude.

26:45.620 --> 26:47.940
And they also have savory snacks.

26:47.940 --> 26:50.100
There was some bruschetta pretzels.

26:50.100 --> 26:52.260
Oh, perfect job.

26:52.260 --> 26:52.980
Bruschetta.

26:52.980 --> 26:54.100
Oh, man, I feel like I'm-

26:54.100 --> 26:55.540
One more of those?

26:55.540 --> 26:56.820
Bruschetta.

26:56.820 --> 27:00.740
I feel like I'm basking under the Tuscan sun.

27:00.740 --> 27:05.620
It's like an Italian vacation in a mouth.

27:05.620 --> 27:07.300
They got baked sweet potato fries.

27:07.300 --> 27:08.180
They got all kinds of-

27:08.180 --> 27:12.340
Baked sweet potato fries.

27:12.340 --> 27:16.340
If you like sweet, if you like spicy, they've got it all.

27:16.340 --> 27:17.460
So go check it out.

27:17.460 --> 27:18.900
Maybe a spicy meatball.

27:21.220 --> 27:22.260
No, sorry, I had a stroke.

27:23.460 --> 27:25.220
And if you go to naturebox.com right now,

That's a steal.

27:36.260 --> 27:36.900
Such a good deal.

27:36.900 --> 27:37.540
It's a robbery.

27:37.540 --> 27:38.340
You're robbing them.

27:39.540 --> 27:41.940
Maybe you cannot steal all of our advertisers' money.

27:41.940 --> 27:42.500
Thank you.

27:42.500 --> 27:43.300

27:47.540 --> 27:48.420

27:48.420 --> 27:50.500
I promise you, you'll totally dig it.

27:50.500 --> 27:52.580
We see so many people on Twitter that say like,

27:52.580 --> 27:54.660
I finally tried it and it's awesome.

27:54.660 --> 27:55.220
I loved it.

27:55.220 --> 27:56.660
And my mouth is watering.

27:56.660 --> 27:59.140
My mouth is currently full of water.

27:59.140 --> 28:00.260
I'm dry drowning.

28:00.260 --> 28:01.460
I don't need to know about your flu.

28:01.460 --> 28:02.020
It's Travis.

28:03.140 --> 28:05.860
If you want to have a job tomorrow,

28:08.580 --> 28:10.340
you need to know how to code.

28:10.340 --> 28:11.780
Big promises.

28:11.780 --> 28:12.740
Big promise.

28:12.740 --> 28:14.500
No, this promise works both ways.

28:14.500 --> 28:15.620
It's carrot and stick here.

28:16.340 --> 28:18.420
If you don't have a job, you want a job tomorrow,

28:18.420 --> 28:19.140
you got to learn to code.

28:19.700 --> 28:22.740
If you have a job and you want to still have a job tomorrow,

28:22.740 --> 28:23.940
you got to learn how to code.

28:23.940 --> 28:24.980
How can I do that so fast?

28:24.980 --> 28:25.860
You're asking me, Justin.

28:25.860 --> 28:27.940
If you want a job, but a different job,

28:28.500 --> 28:30.020
and you also want a second job.

28:30.740 --> 28:33.540
If you want nine jobs, you got to learn how to code.

28:33.540 --> 28:35.140
How do you do that?

28:35.140 --> 28:39.220
Well, you're going to get on the one month HTML bus.

28:39.780 --> 28:42.180
One month HTML is the easiest way to learn to code

28:42.180 --> 28:43.300
and build websites.

28:43.300 --> 28:45.860
I've been doing this and here's how it works.

28:45.860 --> 28:48.580
You log onto the site every day.

28:48.580 --> 28:52.660
There are two or three lessons that you do

28:52.660 --> 28:54.420
that are accompanied by a video.

28:54.420 --> 28:56.980
So basically, you watch a video in one screen

28:56.980 --> 28:59.220
and in your second screen, you code a website.

28:59.220 --> 29:00.980
Even if you've never done that before,

29:00.980 --> 29:03.300
it is going to tell you literally step by step

29:03.300 --> 29:06.660
exactly where to go and what to do.

29:06.660 --> 29:08.500
Like moment to moment, step by step,

29:08.500 --> 29:09.860
here's everything you need.

29:09.860 --> 29:12.020
And you're going to start building a website from day one.

29:12.020 --> 29:14.020
After the first lesson, you will have,

29:14.020 --> 29:16.580
or the first day, you will have a,

29:17.460 --> 29:20.020
admittedly, you know, pretty simple,

29:20.020 --> 29:21.380
but a website that you built.

29:21.380 --> 29:24.740
I built my website, JustinMcElroy.net,

29:25.540 --> 29:26.900
through one month HTML.

29:26.900 --> 29:28.340
Don't go to Justin.

29:28.340 --> 29:29.940
Don't go to JustinMcElroy.com.

29:30.660 --> 29:32.500
It is terrifying.

29:32.500 --> 29:33.620
No, that guy stinks.

29:34.180 --> 29:34.740
No, he's all right.

29:34.740 --> 29:35.620
I guess he's Canadian.

29:35.620 --> 29:37.060
He's Canadian Justin McElroy.

29:37.060 --> 29:39.300
Justin, did you get the email I sent you from Kyle?

29:40.340 --> 29:40.980
No.

29:40.980 --> 29:43.780
Kyle cleaned up the background for your website

29:43.780 --> 29:46.820
so you have a nice clean picture of you gesturing

29:46.820 --> 29:48.900
towards what I assume are the West Virginia hills.

29:48.900 --> 29:50.100
Okay, I will switch that out.

29:50.100 --> 29:50.820
Thank you, Kyle.

29:50.820 --> 29:51.540
I appreciate that.

29:52.820 --> 29:55.460
And here's the best part about it.

29:55.460 --> 29:56.820
They've got other classes.

29:56.820 --> 29:57.860
This isn't the best part about it,

29:57.860 --> 30:00.100
but another part about it, the thing,

30:00.100 --> 30:00.980
is a separate part.

30:01.700 --> 30:04.500
They got a one month Rails class, too,

30:04.500 --> 30:05.700
if you want to learn to be on Rails.

30:07.220 --> 30:08.180
It's super easy.

30:08.180 --> 30:09.220
It's actually really fun.

30:09.220 --> 30:10.900
I kind of look forward to the lessons every day.

30:10.900 --> 30:12.340
I told them when I started

30:12.340 --> 30:16.020
that the biggest problem I have is stopping every day

30:16.020 --> 30:19.300
because I think the lessons are really fun.

30:19.300 --> 30:23.940
So you can enroll at onemonth.com slash my brother

30:23.940 --> 30:28.580
and you'll actually get 25% off 30 minutes a day

30:28.580 --> 30:31.380
for 30 days and you could have this new skill

30:31.380 --> 30:33.220
and right now you can get it for 25% off.

30:33.220 --> 30:36.660
So go to onemonth.com slash my brother.

30:36.660 --> 30:41.300
That's onemonth.com slash my brother and get 25% off.

30:41.300 --> 30:42.500
I'm gonna dip in that Ruby, I think.

30:43.140 --> 30:44.500
Let's see what that's all about.

30:44.500 --> 30:47.060
I pretty much mastered all of the other languages.

30:47.060 --> 30:51.140
So I got two real quick messages.

30:52.980 --> 30:53.780
Here's the first one.

30:54.660 --> 30:58.740
There's a podcast about books, which a great idea, I guess.

30:58.740 --> 31:00.180
I'm not sure there's a lot of crossover there

31:00.180 --> 31:01.700
between people who read books

31:01.700 --> 31:05.620
and prefer to listen to dummies crack wise

31:05.620 --> 31:08.020
about Guardians of the Galaxy, but there you have it.

31:08.020 --> 31:11.780
It's called Tomefoolery and you can check it out on iTunes,

31:11.780 --> 31:14.660
on Stitcher or on their website, tomefoolery.com.

31:15.380 --> 31:16.580
Spelled how it sounds.

31:16.580 --> 31:18.900
Tome, like a book, and foolery.

31:18.900 --> 31:20.420
Like you're saying tomfoolery,

31:20.420 --> 31:22.580
but there's an E in there to make it a pun.

31:23.460 --> 31:25.380
You start back at the beginning, you lost me.

31:25.380 --> 31:26.340
I'm sorry.

31:26.340 --> 31:28.580
You are Enigma wrapped in a mystery.

31:28.580 --> 31:29.700
They've also got a Facebook page,

31:29.700 --> 31:31.380
facebook.com slash Tomefoolery.

31:31.380 --> 31:32.980
Also on Twitter, at Tomefoolery.

31:33.620 --> 31:37.380
Basically twice a month, Cody Melcher and Stephanie Hawes,

31:37.380 --> 31:39.540
who are Chicago-based comedians,

31:40.100 --> 31:42.260
talk about a book with a funny friend of theirs.

31:42.260 --> 31:45.780
They've had people on the show like Tim Kazerinsky

31:45.780 --> 31:47.460
from Saturday Night Live.

31:47.460 --> 31:50.580
Dan Telfer, I guess we can say friend of the show.

31:50.580 --> 31:51.300
Friend of the show.

31:51.300 --> 31:51.940
Friend of the show.

31:51.940 --> 31:54.260
I mean, he introduced us at our first live show.

31:54.260 --> 31:54.740
I'll never forget him for that.

31:54.740 --> 31:55.780
He may not remember us.

31:55.780 --> 31:57.700
He probably doesn't remember us because he was there

31:57.700 --> 31:59.540
when we were the most scared we've ever been

32:00.420 --> 32:01.460
for anything in our lives.

32:01.460 --> 32:03.860
Also got Barbara Gray from Lady Da Lady,

32:03.860 --> 32:06.260
a maximum fun network joint.

32:07.220 --> 32:08.660
Lots of other people, Brandy Posey,

32:08.660 --> 32:10.660
Danny Pewdie from Community.

32:11.220 --> 32:13.780
They've done lots of books from Twilight

32:13.780 --> 32:17.140
to crazy conspiracy books and all kinds of stuff.

32:17.140 --> 32:18.740
So that's Tomefoolery.

32:18.740 --> 32:21.220
It's a book club, but with comedians and weird books,

32:21.220 --> 32:21.780
it sounds like.

32:22.340 --> 32:24.580
And we have another podcast that's supporting the show

32:24.580 --> 32:26.100
this week that you guys should go check out.

32:26.100 --> 32:28.260
It's The Bunker, and it's on iTunes,

32:28.260 --> 32:30.580
or you can go to TheBunkerPodcast.com.

32:30.580 --> 32:33.460
The Bunker Podcast, it's a scripted comedy series

32:33.460 --> 32:34.340
about a breakfast radio show.

32:34.340 --> 32:35.060
Like our show.

32:35.620 --> 32:36.180
Yes.

32:36.180 --> 32:36.900
Fully scripted.

32:37.780 --> 32:40.660
Completely scripted, point A to point B.

32:40.660 --> 32:42.980
And it's a breakfast radio show that takes place

32:42.980 --> 32:44.580
in a post-apocalyptic future.

32:45.140 --> 32:47.380
There's also nice music, stories, and interviews

32:47.380 --> 32:49.300
with storytellers, so go check it out.

32:49.300 --> 32:50.900
TheBunkerPodcast.com.

32:51.540 --> 32:54.580
I mean, if a post-apocalyptic breakfast radio show

32:54.580 --> 32:56.820
doesn't sound funny to you, then get the fuck out.

32:56.820 --> 32:58.420
Get the fuck out of here, kid.

32:59.220 --> 32:59.720
Whoa.

33:01.620 --> 33:03.460
Hey, feeling lonely?

33:03.460 --> 33:04.980
My name's Jesse Thorn.

33:04.980 --> 33:06.980
My name's Jordan Morris.

33:06.980 --> 33:10.500
Do you want to listen to a program where two good friends

33:10.500 --> 33:14.900
get intimate with amazing guests like Maria Bamford,

33:14.900 --> 33:18.980
Rob Corddry, and other comedy superstars?

33:18.980 --> 33:21.300
Jordan Jesse Go is here for you.

33:21.300 --> 33:24.020
Every week, we'll spill our guts for you

33:24.020 --> 33:25.700
and then make some jokes.

33:25.700 --> 33:29.460
Jordan Jesse Go, free at MaximumFun.org.

33:30.580 --> 33:33.940
I got a Yahoo from level 50, 51.

33:34.740 --> 33:36.500
Wow, I guess I downgraded him a little bit.

33:37.460 --> 33:38.580
What did he do?

33:38.580 --> 33:40.020
He's playing a different game.

33:40.020 --> 33:42.340
He has leveled up from 1 to 51 this quickly

33:42.340 --> 33:43.380
in a totally different game.

33:43.380 --> 33:44.820
Anyway, it's Drew Davenport, everybody.

33:44.820 --> 33:45.300
Thank you, Drew.

33:45.300 --> 33:48.420
It's by Yahoo Answers user Uncle Danny Smells.

33:50.820 --> 33:56.020
Uncle Danny Smells asks, how do I eat a Mr. Whippy in public

33:56.020 --> 33:57.540
without looking like a nutcase?

33:58.260 --> 33:58.760
Hold on.

33:59.860 --> 34:01.540
How do I eat a Mr. Whippy?

34:02.420 --> 34:03.300
Mr. Whippy.

34:03.300 --> 34:04.500
Can you guys say that for me?

34:04.500 --> 34:05.700
Mr. Whippy.

34:05.700 --> 34:06.740
Mr. Whippy.

34:06.740 --> 34:07.940
You don't have to do fun voices.

34:07.940 --> 34:08.340
You can just say it.

34:08.340 --> 34:09.140
I wasn't.

34:09.140 --> 34:09.860
Oh, wow.

34:09.860 --> 34:11.700
That's just how that word comes out then.

34:11.700 --> 34:12.200
Yeah.

34:13.220 --> 34:14.180
Wow, okay.

34:14.900 --> 34:16.100
How do I eat a Mr. Whippy?

34:16.100 --> 34:17.620
What is a Mr. Whippy?

34:18.500 --> 34:19.000
Jesus.

34:21.060 --> 34:22.180
I've committed to a bit.

34:23.140 --> 34:28.180
Mr. Whippy is a soft serve ice cream cone.

34:28.180 --> 34:30.660
Isn't that the ice cream man in Pete and Pete?

34:31.460 --> 34:32.340
Mr. Whippy?

34:32.340 --> 34:32.900
Possibly.

34:34.020 --> 34:35.060
Mr. Tasty.

34:35.060 --> 34:35.700
Mr. Tasty.

34:35.700 --> 34:36.260
That was right.

34:36.260 --> 34:36.740
Thank you.

34:36.740 --> 34:38.740
Thank you.

34:38.740 --> 34:40.820
I'm assuming there's an O'Marsh though.

34:40.820 --> 34:42.020
I'm assuming it's an O'Marsh.

34:43.140 --> 34:47.140
I believe Mr. Whippy is an Australian thing.

34:48.020 --> 34:48.900
Just do a quick Google.

34:48.900 --> 34:50.500
Yeah, Australia and New Zealand.

34:51.060 --> 34:52.500
There's a Mr. Whippy.

34:52.500 --> 34:55.220
But I mean, the idea is I think pretty universal.

34:55.220 --> 34:56.660
We're talking about an ice cream cone.

34:56.660 --> 35:01.540
We're talking about that like weird styrofoam platform cone

35:01.540 --> 35:03.380
that's not especially delicious.

35:03.380 --> 35:04.980
A sugar cone, if you will.

35:04.980 --> 35:05.380
I don't know.

35:05.380 --> 35:06.180
Not even a sugar cone.

35:06.180 --> 35:07.620
What do you fucking call that thing?

35:07.620 --> 35:08.980
It's like insulation.

35:09.620 --> 35:15.140
It's like a structured cone that has like a cone inside of

35:15.140 --> 35:17.700
another cone and there's like joints and shit connecting it.

35:17.700 --> 35:19.780
It's got to have a proper name, right?

35:19.780 --> 35:20.260
Yeah.

35:20.260 --> 35:22.820
I think it's just a standard Mr. Whippy cone.

35:23.700 --> 35:27.140
And then you got the swirl going up of soft serve.

35:27.140 --> 35:28.420
And then you just party on that.

35:28.980 --> 35:31.620
I guess my real question is, and I mean this sincerely,

35:31.620 --> 35:37.380
but I've never seen anyone eat one of those and look like a crazy person.

35:37.380 --> 35:39.460
Well, you've never worked at the country's best yogurt, have you?

35:42.100 --> 35:44.100
Do you see a lot of cool styles?

35:44.100 --> 35:47.060
I'm saying as a former the country's best yogurt

35:47.700 --> 35:50.020
employee of the month, several months running,

35:51.140 --> 35:56.180
I earned that honorific by not fucking laughing at people

35:56.180 --> 35:58.500
who ate Mr. Whippy's in front of me.

35:58.500 --> 35:59.860
And it was hard, Travis.

35:59.860 --> 36:00.820
It was hard.

36:00.820 --> 36:02.180
What were they doing wrong?

36:02.180 --> 36:03.700
They were doing everything wrong.

36:07.300 --> 36:08.180
Let's role play.

36:08.180 --> 36:09.460
Let's D&D this out.

36:09.460 --> 36:10.420
I'll be your DM.

36:10.420 --> 36:11.620
I hand you a Mr. Whippy.

36:12.820 --> 36:13.540
What do you do now?

36:13.540 --> 36:14.340
Roll for initiative.

36:14.340 --> 36:16.100
How do you attack that motherfucker?

36:16.100 --> 36:19.140
Well, first things first, I'm going to take care of that little flipped over

36:19.140 --> 36:20.660
part on the top and just bite that off.

36:20.660 --> 36:21.620
You're going to bite that right off.

36:21.620 --> 36:21.860
Okay.

36:22.500 --> 36:23.220
How did you just-

36:23.220 --> 36:26.340
Roll to see if he has sensitive tooth pain.

36:26.340 --> 36:30.580
Do you just sort of position your giant head over this thing

36:30.580 --> 36:32.500
like the mothership in Independence Day

36:32.500 --> 36:35.460
and then sort of lower your gob down onto

36:35.460 --> 36:40.100
and then you sort of encompass it directly like that.

36:40.100 --> 36:40.820
I'm going to be honest.

36:40.820 --> 36:44.420
I'd probably panic and try to bring it from the top to my mouth.

36:44.420 --> 36:46.820
Oh, so you lost it.

36:46.820 --> 36:47.540
You lost the game.

36:47.540 --> 36:48.340
Can I try?

36:48.340 --> 36:48.740
Yeah.

36:48.740 --> 36:50.660
Justin, I hand you a Mr. Whippy cone.

36:50.660 --> 36:51.460
Roll for initiative.

36:54.500 --> 36:56.820
That's my dice roll noise.

36:56.820 --> 36:57.060
Okay.

36:58.020 --> 36:59.780
I extend my tongue just so.

36:59.780 --> 37:03.300
Wait on, slow down, slow down.

37:03.300 --> 37:03.540
Okay.

37:03.540 --> 37:04.980
I extend my tongue just so.

37:04.980 --> 37:07.620
And then I place the Mr. Whippy against my tongue

37:08.420 --> 37:09.380
and then I make this noise.

37:12.980 --> 37:13.940
Is it gone yet?

37:13.940 --> 37:14.580
It's still there.

37:14.580 --> 37:15.940
Can you roll to see if it's still there?

37:20.500 --> 37:21.140
And it's gone.

37:21.140 --> 37:21.620
You did it.

37:21.620 --> 37:22.100
Yay.

37:22.100 --> 37:23.300
Never again do that sound.

37:23.300 --> 37:25.620
Crunch, munch, crunch, munch.

37:25.620 --> 37:30.580
So your strat for down in this month, this bad boy,

37:30.580 --> 37:32.900
is to just do it as fast as possible and hope.

37:34.660 --> 37:36.500
Loudly and graphically as possible.

37:36.500 --> 37:36.980
Sure.

37:36.980 --> 37:38.980
It's unpleasantly as human.

37:38.980 --> 37:42.500
Sonic, the most sonically unpleasant consumption strategy I could devise.

37:42.500 --> 37:44.980
Every Mr. Whippy truck has a picture of Justin that says,

37:44.980 --> 37:45.540
do not serve this man.

37:45.540 --> 37:46.580
Do not serve this man.

37:47.300 --> 37:48.820
Very upsetting for local kids.

37:50.980 --> 37:53.620
I mean, I guess it's like a blow job thing.

37:53.620 --> 37:54.820
Like you don't want to like.

37:54.820 --> 37:55.380
Whoa.

37:55.380 --> 37:57.780
No, I'm just saying I think that's what this person's worried about.

37:57.780 --> 37:59.540
Like, how can I eat this Mr. Whippy?

37:59.540 --> 38:01.220
Because if you go top down, then yeah,

38:01.220 --> 38:03.220
I guess there will be some sort of visual similarity.

38:03.220 --> 38:04.180
If you go at it from the side,

38:04.180 --> 38:06.340
you're gonna look like some sort of crazy rancor.

38:08.900 --> 38:11.300
Other than Griffin working at the country's best yoga,

38:11.300 --> 38:15.460
has anyone ever like seen someone buying a cone of ice cream and thought,

38:15.460 --> 38:16.980
well, let's see how he does.

38:18.500 --> 38:19.060
Good luck.

38:19.860 --> 38:20.820
And do you know what's personally-

38:20.820 --> 38:21.860
Come on, hotshot.

38:21.860 --> 38:23.060
Show me what you got.

38:23.060 --> 38:25.700
Do you know what's personally offensive to me

38:25.700 --> 38:31.780
as the fucking superstar of West Virginia's best,

38:31.780 --> 38:33.060
the country's best yogurt?

38:33.860 --> 38:36.180
Nobody fucking ever asked me how to do it.

38:36.820 --> 38:39.620
Nobody, you're there with a fucking pro.

38:39.620 --> 38:41.460
If you're balling with Michael Jordan,

38:41.460 --> 38:42.980
you don't just do it in front of him

38:42.980 --> 38:44.740
and don't ask him to put on a clinic.

38:45.300 --> 38:46.500
Now here's the thing though,

38:46.500 --> 38:49.860
but I imagine that even worse than looking like a nutcase

38:49.860 --> 38:51.300
is worrying about looking like a dude

38:51.300 --> 38:53.380
who can't figure out an ice cream cone.

38:53.380 --> 38:56.500
How, Brad, would that have been if someone brought you a cone,

38:56.500 --> 39:01.060
just like, listen, I can't get from A to B on this bad boy.

39:01.060 --> 39:02.740
Listen, I tried to come at it from every angle.

39:02.740 --> 39:05.220
It has nothing to do with doing it.

39:05.220 --> 39:07.940
Anybody can eat a fucking ice creamed cone

39:08.820 --> 39:12.820
and anybody can play basketball in front of Michael Jordan.

39:12.820 --> 39:13.380
Are you doing it perfect?

39:13.380 --> 39:15.140
Did you ever see somebody like scrolling their phone

39:15.140 --> 39:19.300
for eHow articles about how the ice cream melting in one hand,

39:19.300 --> 39:23.300
they're just flipping through pages on their phone on the other

39:23.300 --> 39:24.820
trying to find that one eHow article

39:24.820 --> 39:27.940
that's gonna let them get inside the head of this burly beast?

39:27.940 --> 39:29.620
Let me tell you about it, let me tell you about it.

39:31.780 --> 39:36.180
It's a multi-stage fight that you're having with this cone.

39:36.180 --> 39:39.940
And the first two steps are, it's a waiting game at first

39:39.940 --> 39:41.860
because you really want the bottom to get soggy.

39:41.860 --> 39:43.780
I know that seems counterintuitive, but hear me out.

39:43.780 --> 39:47.860
The first stage is all about maintenance

39:47.860 --> 39:49.140
and it's about discretion.

39:49.780 --> 39:51.780
You want to try and keep your mouth

39:51.780 --> 39:55.780
behind the ice creamed portion of the cone.

39:55.780 --> 39:58.260
You want to keep that ice creamed portion

39:58.260 --> 40:02.180
between your mouth and any waiting hungry eyes

40:02.180 --> 40:03.380
that want to see what you're doing

40:03.380 --> 40:05.060
because they're fucking everywhere.

40:05.060 --> 40:06.420
What would you think about a strategy

40:06.420 --> 40:08.100
where you put the whole cone in your mouth

40:08.100 --> 40:09.860
just for safekeeping and hell there,

40:09.860 --> 40:11.780
but you kept your mouth kind of spread open

40:12.340 --> 40:14.500
like inside so that you're not actually touching the ice?

40:14.500 --> 40:17.060
Like an incubator, no, that sounds great.

40:17.060 --> 40:18.340
It's not going to work in practice.

40:18.340 --> 40:19.140
Oh, okay.

40:19.140 --> 40:23.620
You got to maintain that top discreetly, okay?

40:23.620 --> 40:25.780
You want to keep dribbles from dripping off you.

40:26.340 --> 40:27.860
A napkin is helpful in this regard

40:27.860 --> 40:30.180
if you want to keep it around the styrofoam base.

40:30.180 --> 40:32.020
Terrific, if that's your prerogative.

40:32.020 --> 40:36.180
I reached a level of skill where the napkin

40:36.180 --> 40:37.300
was no longer required.

40:38.340 --> 40:39.300
No napkins required.

40:39.300 --> 40:42.260
No napkins required, it was actually kind of embarrassing

40:42.260 --> 40:43.060
to have it there.

40:43.060 --> 40:45.380
So you maintain it until you reach that point

40:45.380 --> 40:47.540
of peak sogginess at the bottom,

40:47.540 --> 40:48.740
and at that point you've whittled down

40:48.740 --> 40:50.740
the ice-creamed portion of the cone,

40:51.380 --> 40:53.460
and then you're going to love this.

40:53.460 --> 40:54.900
You guys are going to fucking love this.

40:55.540 --> 40:57.620
You pick up the cone, hold it above your head

40:57.620 --> 40:59.380
like an ice-creamed beer bomb,

40:59.940 --> 41:02.820
and you bite the bottom directly off of it.

41:02.820 --> 41:05.060
All of a sudden, you're playing an upwards trumpet

41:05.060 --> 41:06.900
to the heavens, and that ice cream

41:06.900 --> 41:10.020
is just going to fucking power blast down your throat,

41:10.020 --> 41:10.980
and you're going to love it.

41:10.980 --> 41:12.260
And then what do you got there?

41:12.260 --> 41:15.060
You have the perfect, the styrofoam has soaked up

41:15.060 --> 41:17.460
the cream in such a pleasing manner,

41:17.460 --> 41:19.700
you can just fold that little gushy baby up

41:20.260 --> 41:22.260
and just go to town.

41:22.260 --> 41:26.500
You have three distinct levels of strategy

41:26.500 --> 41:31.860
and three unique textures, three unique flavor experiences.

41:31.860 --> 41:34.580
It is the only way to down a Mr. Whippy.

41:34.580 --> 41:36.900
I like it when they put the cone on top

41:36.900 --> 41:38.180
and then decorate it with ice-cream

41:38.180 --> 41:39.380
to make it look like a clown.

41:40.900 --> 41:42.020
Get the fuck out of here.

41:42.020 --> 41:43.300
I have a different strategy.

41:43.300 --> 41:44.980
You could use the Justin Baccarat.

41:44.980 --> 41:47.060
Step one, suck it like it's a dick.

41:47.060 --> 41:49.060
Step two, play air guitar.

41:49.060 --> 41:50.820
Step three, high-five every kid in the store.

41:54.100 --> 41:55.300
That also works, yeah.

41:55.860 --> 41:57.700
What I like to do is I take one bite

41:57.700 --> 41:59.860
and I say, too hot, and I throw it on the ground.

42:00.420 --> 42:00.900
That's great.

42:02.020 --> 42:03.940
Brothers, if you have a drink with you

42:03.940 --> 42:05.380
but you need to go to the restroom

42:05.380 --> 42:07.060
and have no one to watch your drink for you,

42:07.060 --> 42:08.260
what do you do with the drink?

42:09.460 --> 42:11.620
If it's not in a resealable bottle,

42:11.620 --> 42:13.380
bringing the drink with you seems gross.

42:14.020 --> 42:16.900
If there's a lot left and chugging it seems like a waste,

42:16.900 --> 42:19.700
that's from perplexed and peeing.

42:19.700 --> 42:21.700
It says pissing, you can say it.

42:21.700 --> 42:24.740
I know, I just thought it would be better to not.

42:24.740 --> 42:27.220
And from perplexed and making water.

42:29.460 --> 42:31.300
It's a tricky situation

42:31.300 --> 42:32.500
because I'm telling you,

42:32.500 --> 42:35.060
if you've got a big, tall, steamy glass of apple juice

42:35.060 --> 42:36.660
and you bring that in and out,

42:36.660 --> 42:38.340
that's the situation.

42:38.340 --> 42:41.860
If you've got Coca-Cola, less of a situation.

42:41.860 --> 42:44.340
Especially if you're at a bar, there's two.

42:44.340 --> 42:46.820
Okay, so on the less extreme side,

42:46.820 --> 42:49.780
you worry about the bar back coming over

42:49.780 --> 42:52.100
and clearing your glasses and taking your glass.

42:52.100 --> 42:53.380
And then two, there's always that risk

42:53.380 --> 42:55.300
that someone's gonna put some fucking shit in your drink

42:55.300 --> 42:56.180
because people are awful.

42:56.180 --> 42:56.980
Kiss people are the worst.

42:59.860 --> 43:00.580
I'm gonna be honest,

43:00.580 --> 43:02.020
I've never thought about it before this moment.

43:02.020 --> 43:03.540
I always just take my drink in with me.

43:04.660 --> 43:07.780
But now I'm thinking about the air being full

43:07.780 --> 43:08.900
of, you know.

43:08.900 --> 43:10.100
Of pee.

43:10.100 --> 43:11.220
Yeah, pee air.

43:11.220 --> 43:14.340
Pee air that the fucking bathroom door magically

43:14.340 --> 43:16.100
and hermetic, the bathroom airlock

43:16.100 --> 43:17.700
magically keeps those pee particles from.

43:18.340 --> 43:20.740
I'm not saying that's going to stop me from doing it.

43:20.740 --> 43:23.860
I'm saying I recognize where perplex is coming from in this

43:23.860 --> 43:25.460
that like, oh, suddenly if you're going like,

43:25.460 --> 43:28.740
oh, taking your bath and drinking the bathroom seems gross.

43:28.740 --> 43:29.460
Yeah, no.

43:29.460 --> 43:31.860
But I don't see how it's any actually grosser

43:31.860 --> 43:34.660
than all of the horrible people that are out in the bar.

43:34.660 --> 43:36.900
I mean, we've talked about the many, many fallacies

43:36.900 --> 43:40.340
surrounding bathroom, like,

43:41.460 --> 43:43.620
contamination, I think.

43:43.620 --> 43:45.220
I think we've pretty much, like,

43:45.220 --> 43:49.620
I have talked about how I can pee without ever touching it.

43:49.620 --> 43:50.580
It being my penis.

43:51.140 --> 43:53.380
And you should not, as a result, have to wash your hands.

43:53.380 --> 43:54.740
I shouldn't need to.

43:54.740 --> 43:57.220
My, the front of my jeans aren't dirty, dad.

43:58.900 --> 43:59.620
The front of my jeans-

43:59.620 --> 44:01.300
You can get a special t-shirt that says that

44:01.300 --> 44:03.060
so you don't have to go explaining it every time

44:03.060 --> 44:03.860
you use the restroom.

44:03.860 --> 44:04.340
I don't touch-

44:04.340 --> 44:05.140
Hands free.

44:05.140 --> 44:09.940
Hands free, no winging or touch, no scope, 360, pee shot.

44:10.660 --> 44:14.500
Front of my jeans aren't dirty, so I didn't wash my hands, dad.

44:14.500 --> 44:16.740
And then on the back, you got a problem with that?

44:16.740 --> 44:18.420
And it'll be a picture of me shrugging my arms

44:18.420 --> 44:19.460
in a, like, threatening manner.

44:25.220 --> 44:26.580
That's on presale now.

44:26.580 --> 44:30.820
It's on presale now, you can get the maximum foot store.

44:30.820 --> 44:31.540
No look.

44:31.540 --> 44:32.900
It says daddy's best boy, 2014.

44:32.900 --> 44:34.340
Daddy's best boy.

44:34.340 --> 44:36.020
No look, no scope, pee shot.

44:40.420 --> 44:42.100
And on the other sleeve, it says in memory,

44:42.100 --> 44:43.700
in loving memory of Big Darryl.

44:45.700 --> 44:48.180
Gone but not forgotten, never forget, mother forever.

44:49.380 --> 44:51.700
Angels only leave paths on your heart

44:51.700 --> 44:55.220
from the tracks in your tears to the strain of the angels.

44:56.500 --> 44:57.380
It's a big shirt.

44:57.380 --> 45:00.020
I love you, Big Darryl.

45:00.020 --> 45:03.060
It's not a huge, puffy sleeve to accommodate all of the text.

45:03.060 --> 45:06.180
Thank you for teaching me your no-scope pee ways.

45:08.500 --> 45:09.220
You were the best.

45:09.220 --> 45:10.980
You were the best stranger.

45:13.620 --> 45:14.820
Nobody's gonna step to you.

45:14.820 --> 45:17.380
No one's gonna step to you with that shirt.

45:17.380 --> 45:19.940
Just get in their face, one v one me, if you don't believe it.

45:19.940 --> 45:22.500
If you don't believe me, I'll be right next to you.

45:22.500 --> 45:23.860
Get that black light.

45:23.860 --> 45:26.740
Yeah, let's scope the front of my jeans.

45:27.460 --> 45:28.020
Nothing there.

45:28.020 --> 45:33.060
Yeah, just take your fucking drink in.

45:33.060 --> 45:34.260
Y'all want a Yahoo?

45:34.260 --> 45:34.660
Yep.

45:35.380 --> 45:37.540
This Yahoo was...

45:39.780 --> 45:46.260
This Yahoo was sent in by Cameron Ogier or Ogier or Ogier.

45:47.140 --> 45:47.940
Ogier.

45:47.940 --> 45:49.060
Okay, sure.

45:49.060 --> 45:49.620
Thank you, Cameron.

45:49.620 --> 45:53.220
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Ogiao.

45:53.220 --> 45:54.420
A lot of, come on.

45:54.420 --> 45:58.100
Who asks, how can I become an aristocrat?

45:59.300 --> 46:04.900
I'm spellbound by the culture, history, and essence of the British aristocracy,

46:05.460 --> 46:09.220
particularly by the English aristocrats of deepest Yorkshire,

46:09.940 --> 46:13.700
with their magnificent rolling estates and majestic country houses,

46:13.700 --> 46:17.140
towering stallions and grand dinner parties.

46:17.140 --> 46:18.820
I want to be an aristocrat.

46:18.820 --> 46:22.980
I've spent some time visiting country houses, cathedrals, abbeys,

46:22.980 --> 46:27.860
and in historical monuments rooted in the heritage and culture of the old England.

46:27.860 --> 46:32.020
And I think that in order for me to fully absorb the essence of British heritage,

46:32.020 --> 46:34.020
I must become an aristocrat.

46:34.020 --> 46:39.860
I want my own beautiful estate, my own gorgeous old country house with luxurious drawing rooms

46:39.860 --> 46:45.140
and paintings of kings, queens, nobles, and personalities of the British chivalry.

46:45.140 --> 46:47.060
I want to be a part of this world.

46:48.660 --> 46:50.260
If there's one thing I know,

46:50.260 --> 46:52.820
it is that you dress for the job you want.

46:52.820 --> 46:53.320
Sure.

46:54.420 --> 46:58.980
So I think you need to go full on fox hunt outfit 24-7.

47:00.980 --> 47:02.900
Welcome to Dinny's, sire.

47:02.900 --> 47:10.660
So in conclusion, Mr. Bank Officer, that is why I need one million pounds.

47:10.660 --> 47:12.740
That's not going to do it, I don't think.

47:13.780 --> 47:16.820
Unless you do like a time travel issue,

47:16.820 --> 47:20.740
unless you do like a time travel issue, like I don't think,

47:20.740 --> 47:23.700
I don't think the million pounds is going to do it.

47:23.700 --> 47:25.700
Well, I also don't know what conversion rates are.

47:25.700 --> 47:28.260
I think that's like six billion dollars.

47:29.700 --> 47:36.100
Listen, we all watched Downton Abbey and we pretend to know how the fuck any of that shit works.

47:36.820 --> 47:38.580
Why do they have all that stuff?

47:39.780 --> 47:41.540
I never see them paying rent.

47:41.540 --> 47:45.220
They never pay rent or mortgage and they just get money.

47:45.220 --> 47:46.820
We have to manage the lands.

47:46.820 --> 47:50.740
Cool, I mow my fucking lawn every other weekend.

47:50.740 --> 47:53.540
I don't get paid billions of pounds, sir.

47:53.540 --> 47:57.060
The game's keeper watches over the herd of deer that lives on the ground.

47:57.060 --> 47:58.820
Do those deers shit gold?

47:59.380 --> 48:00.740
I got squirrels.

48:00.740 --> 48:02.100
You will never hear them like,

48:02.820 --> 48:05.140
Listen, we have to get on our paper chase.

48:06.340 --> 48:08.820
We gotta get that paper.

48:09.940 --> 48:11.540
Get on the grind, everyone.

48:11.540 --> 48:12.900
We have to get that paper.

48:12.900 --> 48:13.940
I think it's just like,

48:13.940 --> 48:16.100
Turn the light off.

48:16.100 --> 48:17.860
Were you born in a barn?

48:17.860 --> 48:20.260
Every light in the manor is on.

48:20.260 --> 48:21.780
Turn down for what?

48:23.540 --> 48:24.100
Interesting.

48:26.820 --> 48:29.380
I do remember when the Duchess had turned down for what?

48:34.660 --> 48:37.380
Is it just like a situation where somebody,

48:38.020 --> 48:42.900
maybe they invented the quill or some shit and they just made like a trill?

48:42.900 --> 48:43.460
A quill?

48:43.460 --> 48:44.740
A trill from that quill?

48:45.380 --> 48:48.340
And then they just sort of coast on that?

48:49.060 --> 48:50.660
Is it possible that no one,

48:51.220 --> 48:54.100
castles are too sweet and no one can own them?

48:54.100 --> 48:58.260
So you just roam the English countryside looking for one that's full of skeletons?

48:58.260 --> 49:00.180
You think, well, okay, this is mine now.

49:00.180 --> 49:00.660
Yeah.

49:00.660 --> 49:01.940
This is my castle.

49:01.940 --> 49:07.460
I'd be willing to bet that if you asked any aristocrat or just old, old blood aristocrat,

49:07.460 --> 49:09.700
how did your family become aristocrats?

49:09.700 --> 49:11.940
Their response would be, well, we've just always been.

49:11.940 --> 49:12.900
I don't remember.

49:14.660 --> 49:16.500
Do you think maybe it was like ordained by God?

49:16.500 --> 49:18.340
Like God created the heavens and earth.

49:18.340 --> 49:19.780
He made the light and the dark.

49:19.780 --> 49:21.220
He made the oceans and the land.

49:21.220 --> 49:23.940
And then he made some people like really super rich forever.

49:23.940 --> 49:24.180
Yeah.

49:24.740 --> 49:26.500
Hey, good, good, good news.

49:26.500 --> 49:27.300
The Williamses.

49:28.340 --> 49:29.140
Your cup.

49:29.140 --> 49:30.500
Y'all are fucking set.

49:31.220 --> 49:32.740
You prayed the right way.

49:32.740 --> 49:33.220
Not you.

49:33.220 --> 49:34.340
Pray more like them.

49:34.340 --> 49:34.740
Not you.

49:34.740 --> 49:35.860
The Williamses.

49:35.860 --> 49:37.060
You heard me wrong.

49:37.060 --> 49:37.460
Billions.

49:37.460 --> 49:38.900
You missed it by one letter.

49:38.900 --> 49:43.300
Their family, their family's last name will be forgotten throughout the ages.

49:43.940 --> 49:44.580
The Williams.

49:44.580 --> 49:46.420
You are my least favorite family.

49:47.460 --> 49:49.380
You get nothing.

49:49.380 --> 49:53.460
But when you enter into my house, you will get room, I guess.

49:53.460 --> 49:54.660
You'll get, you'll do okay.

49:54.660 --> 49:56.100
The Meek shall inherit the earth.

49:56.100 --> 49:58.980
Except for the Williamses who get everything.

50:02.020 --> 50:02.660
I don't know, man.

50:02.660 --> 50:04.580
It seems like a pretty cool fucking scene though.

50:04.580 --> 50:06.580
I mean, except for all the indentured servitude.

50:06.580 --> 50:09.620
Dude, other than that, pretty cool scene.

50:09.620 --> 50:16.260
The weird thing about the Downton Abbey, the life that is presented there in the aristocracy,

50:16.260 --> 50:22.500
is like for people that don't have to do anything, they do a lot of things.

50:22.500 --> 50:25.780
Like they are very busy inventing purpose.

50:25.780 --> 50:28.100
Like yeah, and they also have a lot of stakes.

50:28.100 --> 50:29.540
They have really high stakes.

50:29.540 --> 50:34.420
Yeah, like super high stakes for somebody who never has to worry about anything.

50:34.420 --> 50:39.300
Why isn't there one, like realistically, why isn't there one member of the Downton Abbey

50:40.340 --> 50:41.220
sect that's like...

50:41.780 --> 50:42.900
Smoke weed every day.

50:46.100 --> 50:47.380
That's my jam.

50:47.380 --> 50:48.340
That's where I'm at.

50:48.340 --> 50:50.820
I mean, this totally chill dog found a cool tree.

50:50.820 --> 50:53.060
We're going to smoke weed and sleep under it.

50:54.340 --> 50:57.060
For the next two weeks, because fuck it.

50:57.060 --> 50:58.980
I made this hand sculpted bong.

50:58.980 --> 51:01.380
I was going to sell them, but then I was like, fuck it.

51:01.380 --> 51:06.900
I would like to see an episode of Downton Abbey where the entire DVD episode is an hour long

51:06.900 --> 51:11.140
and it's one of them just wandering through the house trying to find another family member

51:11.140 --> 51:13.300
to hang out with because they're super fucking bored.

51:13.300 --> 51:13.540
Yeah.

51:13.540 --> 51:14.500
Anyone want to chill?

51:15.060 --> 51:15.560
Steven?

51:17.140 --> 51:18.260
Is there anyone in here?

51:18.820 --> 51:19.620
No?

51:19.620 --> 51:20.180
Servants?

51:21.140 --> 51:22.900
Just want something to do.

51:22.900 --> 51:24.420
Got the new masters on EP.

51:25.860 --> 51:26.420
Anybody?

51:27.700 --> 51:28.740
Want to make a pizza?

51:28.740 --> 51:31.060
Do you want to make pizza?

51:32.340 --> 51:33.620
Homemade pizza?

51:34.740 --> 51:36.100
I got some sweet shrooms.

51:36.740 --> 51:38.420
Yes, both kinds.

51:38.420 --> 51:39.780
Smoke weed every day.

51:41.380 --> 51:42.020
Anybody?

51:43.460 --> 51:44.180
Got Jenga?

51:45.860 --> 51:46.980
I invented Jenga.

51:47.780 --> 51:48.660
Anybody?

51:48.660 --> 51:49.700
I'm Laura Linney.

51:49.700 --> 51:51.620
You're watching Masterpiece Theater.

51:51.620 --> 51:56.340
Last week, we watched as Bernie found the dankest herb and enjoyed it with his good,

51:56.340 --> 51:57.380
good dog.

51:57.380 --> 52:00.580
They chilled under a tree and slept for six hours, then made pizzas.

52:02.100 --> 52:03.220
What will happen this week?

52:04.900 --> 52:06.260
On Turn Downton...

52:06.260 --> 52:07.540
Ah, fuck, I blew it.

52:07.540 --> 52:12.100
Will Ronson's brother return from the war and will Bernie find another dope stash of

52:12.100 --> 52:13.300
high quality ganja?

52:15.620 --> 52:16.580
Travis, stick it again.

52:16.580 --> 52:17.540
You can land it this time.

52:20.580 --> 52:23.060
Next on Turn Downton for what theater?

52:24.340 --> 52:24.840
Damn it.

52:24.840 --> 52:27.000
Ah, fuck.

52:30.040 --> 52:31.480
So this has been My Brother, My Brother, Me.

52:31.480 --> 52:37.000
It's an advice show that we do every week with each other and you can listen to it if

52:37.000 --> 52:37.500
you want.

52:37.960 --> 52:43.320
And it's just a show to help you out.

52:43.320 --> 52:44.600
What more do you want from us?

52:44.600 --> 52:46.600
Thank you for people tweeting about the show.

52:47.880 --> 52:50.920
Our boy Nick Roberts recommended it to Morgan Kitten.

52:50.920 --> 52:52.840
Hopefully Morgan Kitten is listening.

52:52.840 --> 52:59.800
Thank you to Alice D., David Lally, Dylan Sochi, Cthulhu29, Kevin Rushing, Jennifer

You're the best for tweeting about our show.

53:11.080 --> 53:11.960
So thanks.

53:11.960 --> 53:15.720
And we want to say thanks again to our friends at Nature Box who have been supporters of

Get in shape for summer and get that beach body stuff.

53:24.680 --> 53:26.680
I think the function is going to be the same.

53:27.560 --> 53:28.120
Yeah, okay.

53:28.120 --> 53:31.160
All forms and the same function that you eat them and then digest them.

53:38.760 --> 53:41.960
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song, It's

53:41.960 --> 53:44.680
a Departure, off the album Putting the Days to Bed.

53:45.800 --> 53:46.760
I don't know what to say, guys.

53:46.760 --> 53:47.800
What I haven't said already.

53:47.800 --> 53:51.160
It's a fucking action packed way to start the show off.

53:51.160 --> 53:52.600
But there's a lot of slow jams on there, too.

53:52.600 --> 53:55.800
A lot of slower cuts, a lot of more pensive tunes.

53:57.080 --> 53:57.880
Check out the record.

53:58.440 --> 54:03.000
I also want to thank everybody who has been sharing the YouTube videos we've been posting

54:03.000 --> 54:04.120
and telling everybody about it.

54:04.120 --> 54:05.480
You guys have been really, really awesome.

54:05.480 --> 54:06.200
Thank you so much.

54:06.200 --> 54:10.920
If you haven't gone to check it out, it's YouTube, it's MBMBAM.

54:10.920 --> 54:12.200
We put up some animated videos.

54:12.200 --> 54:13.640
We're putting up old episodes.

54:13.640 --> 54:16.920
There's live live show videos.

54:17.640 --> 54:18.200
Thank you so much.

54:18.200 --> 54:18.840
You guys are awesome.

54:18.840 --> 54:19.340
Yep.

54:20.440 --> 54:21.400
That's going to do it for us.

54:21.400 --> 54:23.080
I guess this week.

54:23.080 --> 54:24.440
Listen to the other Max.

54:24.440 --> 54:26.680
Listen to the other shows of the Max Fund Network too.

54:32.360 --> 54:35.400

54:37.400 --> 54:40.440
Are y'all still putting Eps out or are you on hiatus?

54:40.440 --> 54:42.040
No, no, no, we're in it.

54:42.680 --> 54:43.180
All right.

54:44.360 --> 54:46.440
They make that show for you and it's really good.

54:46.440 --> 54:48.920
So go listen to it.

54:48.920 --> 54:51.480
And yeah, final question time, I guess.

54:51.480 --> 54:55.720
This one was sent in by Ira Ray.

54:56.440 --> 54:58.280
Are you Ira Ray?

54:58.280 --> 54:59.400
Who wants to know?

54:59.400 --> 55:00.520
Thank you very much, Ira Ray.

55:00.520 --> 55:05.640
It's by Yahoo Answers user Snow Bunny Love 420 who asks,

55:07.800 --> 55:11.720
did Kenny Rogers change his name to Kenny Loggins?

55:11.720 --> 55:17.400
I'm Justin McElroy.

55:17.400 --> 55:18.200
I'm Travis McElroy.

55:18.200 --> 55:19.560
I'm Griffin McElroy.

55:19.560 --> 55:20.280
This has been my brother.

55:20.280 --> 55:21.800
My brother may kiss your dad.

55:21.800 --> 55:32.200
School hair on the lips.

Hey, Ross.

55:46.920 --> 55:47.720
Hey, Carrie.

55:47.720 --> 55:48.920
It's me, your co-host.

55:48.920 --> 55:49.320
Oh, yeah.

55:49.320 --> 55:50.040
We have a show, don't we?

55:50.040 --> 55:50.920
We have a show.

55:50.920 --> 55:52.760
Oh, no, Ross and Carrie.

55:52.760 --> 55:55.560
It's about undercover investigations of fringe groups.

55:55.560 --> 55:55.880
Yeah.

55:55.880 --> 55:57.960
Like the Tony Alamo Ministries cult.

55:57.960 --> 55:58.360
Yep.

55:58.360 --> 55:59.880
That's led by a pedophile.

55:59.880 --> 56:00.600
He's in jail.

56:00.600 --> 56:01.800
He's in jail.

56:01.800 --> 56:04.280
Also, we became Mormons.

56:04.280 --> 56:06.520
We became Raelians, which is a UFO group.

56:06.520 --> 56:07.080
That's right.

56:07.080 --> 56:09.240
We joined the Ordo Templi Orientis.

56:09.240 --> 56:09.640
Yes.

56:09.640 --> 56:11.320
The 9-11 truthers.

56:11.320 --> 56:12.040
We got cupped.

56:12.040 --> 56:13.000
We got acupunctured.

56:13.000 --> 56:13.720
We got reiki.

56:13.720 --> 56:16.760
We've pretty much anything that you've heard of and been like,

56:16.760 --> 56:18.440
that doesn't sound quite right.

56:18.440 --> 56:19.400
We've done that.

56:19.400 --> 56:20.920
So you don't have to do it.

56:20.920 --> 56:32.040
So if you want to hear about this, and you should, then go to maximumfun.org.
