00:00.000 --> 00:07.460
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be

00:07.460 --> 00:14.780
followed. Oh Travis insists he's a sexpert but if there's a degree on his

00:14.780 --> 00:22.040
wall balcony I haven't seen it. Also this show isn't for kids which I mentioned

00:22.040 --> 00:28.560
only so the babies out there know how cool they are for listening. What's up

00:28.560 --> 00:31.920
you cool baby!

00:58.560 --> 01:21.360
It's better, it's better with you. My life. It's better, it's better with you. This is true. It's better, it's better with you. My life. It's better with you.

01:21.360 --> 01:25.280
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother my brother and me an advice show for the

01:25.280 --> 01:32.960
modern era. I'm your oldest brother Justin Tyler McElroy. I'm your middlest

01:32.960 --> 01:46.640
brother Travis Tyler McElroy. And I'm Xavier dark mime Xavier shadow Raven

01:46.640 --> 01:57.000
and I'm a I am a sorcerer. You know it's Griffin say never talk about this in the

01:57.000 --> 02:01.080
books but like 90% of being a sorcerer is just having the confidence to call

02:01.080 --> 02:07.880
yourself a sorcerer. This is Griffin's second night wearing a tuxedo. I will

02:07.880 --> 02:16.480
say I will say the cape is new the cape is for you Portland. Well it's not new

02:16.480 --> 02:20.360
Griffin borrowed it from our tour manager Amanda. Our business manager

02:20.360 --> 02:26.200
Amanda thank you and I will say that the fit is as such that it does make me look

02:26.200 --> 02:32.280
like mr. Potter from it's a wonderful life. And it's also impressive because I

02:32.280 --> 02:36.120
don't know how he's done this like physically the cape is on the outside

02:36.120 --> 02:41.920
then jacket but the cape is connected to the vest underneath the jacket. Sorcerer.

02:41.920 --> 02:47.040
Everybody looks great. I don't know I didn't see dad until right before we

02:47.040 --> 02:56.080
came out. I do not know. He doesn't run any of that bias by management. It used

02:56.080 --> 02:59.800
to be that dad would buy a t-shirt or something at the airport that had like

02:59.800 --> 03:05.760
the name of the city we were on and now he's gone. I don't know yeah my favorite

03:05.760 --> 03:12.440
part of his intro was when he suggested that he is paid for his services. I saw

03:12.440 --> 03:17.080
dad and Travis standing next to each other backstage and it occurred to me it

03:17.080 --> 03:22.720
looked like if there was a new Sherlock Holmes movie and you turn it on and then

03:22.720 --> 03:29.760
five minutes in they come on the screen and you're like no I don't think so no

03:29.760 --> 03:37.040
Did he just say his name is Maury Farty? That's not it. That's not it.

03:37.040 --> 03:41.320
Anyway this is an advice show. We're so thrilled to be back here in Portland

03:41.320 --> 03:51.840
Oregon. We ordered um we uh how can I how can I you know that spicy lettuce you

03:51.840 --> 04:01.280
guys like yeah you should have we haven't consumed any yeah yeah act two

04:01.280 --> 04:09.560
suited and zooted is no no no no don't work cowards there's no way you could

04:09.560 --> 04:14.800
have seen us tittering like schoolchildren backstage as we legally

04:14.800 --> 04:22.520
purchase recreational drugs it's just me and Travis like look this one's called

04:22.520 --> 04:28.520
Obamacare that's pretty good that's hilarious I like anything that sounds

04:28.520 --> 04:32.960
like the name of a cream song you know it's just like soda pop dreams and I'm

04:32.960 --> 04:37.360
like yeah that's my thing I want to go to sleep ten minutes after the show's

04:37.360 --> 04:44.200
done it's it couldn't possibly be harder to choose like I'm looking at them and

04:44.200 --> 04:49.240
they're like this one's fucking chock full of resin and I'm like yeah yes yes

04:49.240 --> 04:55.360
good and then I start thinking like is that too much resin for me can I handle

04:55.360 --> 05:00.720
that level of resin it's resin like wax what's resin it's demoralizing on

05:00.720 --> 05:07.760
purpose to keep the squares out I I purchased weed in Texas a few times

05:07.760 --> 05:13.440
which I can say now cuz I don't live there anymore yeah good luck getting

05:13.440 --> 05:20.760
them now Ted Cruz and I would be like um excuse me sir how much of it can I get

05:20.760 --> 05:27.000

05:27.000 --> 05:32.920
piss it's the newest strain from the backpack boys like yes okay I love it

05:32.920 --> 05:36.760
Justin and I were also like those friends at a restaurant where someone's

05:36.760 --> 05:39.520

05:39.520 --> 05:44.640

05:59.920 --> 06:06.280
maybe this is the one where we just second act come out bombed out of our

06:06.280 --> 06:19.240
mind listen stop you think you'd think right at least one third of us though by

06:19.240 --> 06:24.480
which I mean me would be so paranoid and weird I would say something and you guys

06:24.480 --> 06:30.720
would laugh and I'd be like why are you laughing what did I do this is an advice

06:30.720 --> 06:37.320
show and we have emerged here in Portland like our friends the Chilean

06:37.320 --> 06:42.480
miners who dug their way out of the ground with their own bare hands and

06:42.480 --> 06:45.880
they don't talk about that enough when they tell that story they burrowed out

06:45.880 --> 06:49.560
of the ground with their own bare hands yeah and then they saw their shadows

06:49.560 --> 06:54.040
that went back and it was six more weeks of winter to this we're gonna help you

06:54.040 --> 07:00.000

let's take a vote oh wait yes

07:12.440 --> 07:22.680
erotic erotic there we go let it breathe okay today I saw my pups breeder on an

07:22.680 --> 07:30.200
episode of judge Judy I learned I knew that the breeder was having issues with

07:30.200 --> 07:34.920
another breeder around dog ownership I mean I didn't think they're arguing

07:34.920 --> 07:41.100
over the rights to the matrix assumed but I didn't know the details how can I

07:41.100 --> 07:45.800
casually bring up that I saw the episode and would love to know more I grew up

07:45.800 --> 07:49.180
watching judge Judy with my mom and would love to get some details about the

07:49.180 --> 07:52.960
judge we all grew up watching just Judy with our mom that goes without saying it

07:52.960 --> 07:57.000
seems a little insensitive to ask the episode was from last year and the

07:57.000 --> 08:00.040
ruling was a little bit of a mixed result that's from pondering pup owner

08:00.040 --> 08:06.480
in Portland are you here all right I love welcome the concern that it's

08:06.480 --> 08:12.200
insensitive to talk about the private matter of them being well it sounds it

08:12.200 --> 08:19.160
sounds like they got their ass beat no it's a mixed it's a mixed result which

08:19.160 --> 08:28.640
is always what you want in court I am I listen I say this at 80% of my cases

08:28.640 --> 08:32.960
both sides were in the wrong let's just come together now get out of here

08:32.960 --> 08:37.400

08:37.400 --> 08:43.080
can settle one thing for you conclusively I guarantee that your dog

08:43.080 --> 08:48.640
breeder saw judge Judy for the exact same number of seconds as you saw judge

08:48.640 --> 08:54.440
Judy on television I guarantee judge Judy had five episodes of film that day

08:54.440 --> 08:58.760
I guarantee Judy's not coming out beforehand like so how's everybody doing

08:58.760 --> 09:04.440

Phil because it wait the first one's an accident Justin no I accidentally watched

11:23.800 --> 11:27.960

12:27.640 --> 12:32.080
does you wanna do another question uh-huh okay I've recently started

12:32.080 --> 12:36.040
tucking in my shirt I'm in my 30s so I guess I've never thought about it before

12:36.040 --> 12:39.440
but do you think when we start reading these questions at live shows someone in

12:39.440 --> 12:44.800
the audience goes start talking in my shirt that's me I'm the shirt Tucker I

12:44.800 --> 12:50.400
love when they dub over Samuel Jackson when he's like you sure

12:50.920 --> 12:58.200
thanks get these shirts off this mother tucking plane I recently started tucking

12:58.200 --> 13:02.800
in my shirt I'm in my 30s so I guess it was just time yes however I work in

13:02.800 --> 13:08.280
construction and all the bending down and moving around pulls my shirt out of

13:08.280 --> 13:14.080
my pants constantly you doing backflips in order to retuck my shirt I have to

13:14.080 --> 13:19.120
loosen my belt and stick my hands down my pants yeah which is a weird look when

13:19.120 --> 13:22.920
people catch me with my pants undone while I'm working on their kitchen

13:22.920 --> 13:27.840
countertops or whatever oh cuz it's like you're enjoying your genitals you could

13:27.840 --> 13:32.400
have found a more tasteful place to fix yourself to get yourself you step over

13:32.400 --> 13:36.020
into a corner you face the corner and you do your business and hope no one

13:36.020 --> 13:40.760
sees but if they do they'll think at least he's politely masturbating is

13:40.760 --> 13:48.040
there anything I can say to people when I'm elbow deep in my car hearts not that

13:48.040 --> 13:54.000
though well I was elbow deep in my car hearts on a Friday night looking for

13:54.000 --> 14:01.460
loving my car hearts on the banks of the Chattahoochee in the back of my truck

14:01.460 --> 14:05.640
bed with my hands in my car hearts but they weren't the only hands if you know

14:05.640 --> 14:11.240
what I mean yes ghost hands like in Ghostbusters one you guys ever seen that

14:11.240 --> 14:16.200
it's weird am I right how could they make a new Ghostbusters and not have

14:16.200 --> 14:23.240
Slimer in it come on guys Slimer doesn't get anybody off

14:23.240 --> 14:34.880
are you ready for some football it'd be cool if that ghost kept calling him

14:34.880 --> 14:40.880
through the whole movie like hey I just never heard from you and that's where

14:40.880 --> 14:49.400
the term ghosted comes from yeah so that deserved better no it did guys crushed it

14:49.400 --> 14:52.480
is there anything I could say to people when I'm elbow deep in my car hearts to

14:52.480 --> 14:56.600
justify or gloss over the situation just saying I'm tucking in my shirt

14:56.600 --> 15:05.240
feels a little if your voice breaks I'm almost finished I'm 41 years old I don't

15:05.240 --> 15:09.680
know I'm Greg Brady in every okay just saying I'm tucking in my shirt feels a

15:09.680 --> 15:16.000
little he doth protest too much that's from tucking troubles into Portland and

15:16.000 --> 15:20.000
it says here alliteration is not my strong suit are neither it seems is

15:20.000 --> 15:31.400
discretion what are you are you here God bless you I got it you ready for

15:31.400 --> 15:38.760
this yeah you're gonna need to sew your shirt into your underpants excellent

15:38.760 --> 15:46.160
that's really good so your shirt to your underpants and make a velcro front so

15:46.160 --> 15:50.800
you can just rip it up there you go and then every time you reach up to install

15:50.800 --> 16:00.160
a countertop hinge or whatever you'd be like I'm ripping myself at half no

16:00.160 --> 16:08.160
surprise hugs that is as far as I can hug right now suits are not made for a

16:08.160 --> 16:17.320
hugging this is why business dads are so distant the dad in Mary Poppins was a

16:17.320 --> 16:24.480
great dad mr. Banks can't physically hug his children so he makes up all these

16:24.480 --> 16:31.280
excuses that he has to hire someone in petticoats to hug his children that's

16:31.280 --> 16:39.720
how restrictive his tuxedo is he's sewn into it sewn into it every morning did I

16:39.720 --> 16:46.200
mean a bet belt a belt doesn't hold the shirt and holds the pants up now it just

16:46.200 --> 16:52.360
gets in your way when you need to fix it maybe what about like an elastic belt

16:52.360 --> 16:56.520
where there's some tension there great okay that and then what about longer

16:56.520 --> 17:02.120
shirt what about really really really long shirt oh yeah Scrooge that shit

17:02.120 --> 17:06.600
yeah Scrooge it up and then at night with sleepy time you light your candle

17:06.600 --> 17:11.240
you have a bit of potato soup loving it you learn a lot about love put on your

17:11.240 --> 17:18.400
tassel cap and slip on off to dreamland it'd be beautiful I have great news for

17:18.400 --> 17:25.320
you anytime anyone has ever been in my home to do any work whatsoever impressing

17:25.320 --> 17:31.700
them is my number one priority I I've actually not letting them know how

17:31.700 --> 17:37.880
ignorant I am of what they're doing and making them I can't think of another

17:37.880 --> 17:43.840
word other than proud of me yeah I've been meaning to ask you both do you do

17:43.840 --> 17:47.480
this thing when someone comes into your house to fix something do you ratchet up

17:47.480 --> 17:54.280
your West Virginia accent yeah I do say like yeah man I don't know I don't know

17:54.280 --> 17:59.880
what's happening yeah I also checked that yeah to build on Justin's point I

17:59.880 --> 18:06.360
think the answer is whenever you are caught adjusting yourself and if they

18:06.360 --> 18:09.960
have the audacity to say something along the lines of like what are you doing

18:09.960 --> 18:16.800
just look back at them and be like this is part of it do you do you want these

18:16.800 --> 18:25.200
countertops installed or do you want to hinges on these counters or not how are

18:25.200 --> 18:31.240
you gonna get to the sink if I don't put hinges on these counters when is a good

18:31.240 --> 18:37.380
time to tell this girl I've been talking to that I've released an acapella album

18:37.380 --> 18:42.960
what's the right time track for don't get oh you're liking this I'm enjoying

18:42.960 --> 18:49.840
this a well surprise check this out oh that's right

18:49.840 --> 18:55.560
you made an acapella track but you just did the backing yeah I couldn't find

18:55.560 --> 18:59.520
anybody else to sing with me but you get like how the rest of it would go I do

18:59.520 --> 19:07.680
all the what don't get me wrong I love when that member of Rockapella went on a

19:07.680 --> 19:14.640
solo career don't get me wrong acapella is pretty cool thus the album yeah but

19:14.640 --> 19:20.520
telling someone about it nah nah nah that's more abrasive than selling your

19:20.520 --> 19:26.200
saying you're a SoundCloud rapping career when if at all should I tell her

19:26.200 --> 19:30.920

19:44.520 --> 19:52.920
Connor Connor Connor be honest is it good hell yeah yeah says Connor I actually

19:52.920 --> 19:57.920
I actually have a little bit of life experience with this many years ago we

19:57.920 --> 20:03.120
were in Portland here and we got high on drugs and decide we're gonna get into

20:03.120 --> 20:13.280
trolls too in part of the recording of that podcast we would frequently feature

20:13.280 --> 20:21.240
our toughest nails means mean mean guy in a different time period gangster yeah

20:21.240 --> 20:24.760
he's like a really mean guy and his name is Joel Begleiter and he's our agent

20:24.760 --> 20:29.600
you know he's not mean he's just a tough guy and we found this just tougher than

20:29.600 --> 20:37.040
us and he's got he did he was in an acapella group in college called the

20:37.040 --> 20:42.840
Brown Derby's right and we found down Easter Alexa by the Brown Derby's if you

20:42.840 --> 20:46.520
could find that on Spotify in which he was the lead soloist he was the lead

20:46.520 --> 20:51.440
soloist and we were so jazzed to find this because we were like we fucking got

20:51.440 --> 20:56.000
a crack in the armor we finally got a crack in Joel's armor and then we were

20:56.000 --> 21:00.080
like Joel guess what dog we got you and he was like did you listen to it we're

21:00.080 --> 21:07.040
like yeah and he was like it's pretty good right we're like yeah it's like

21:07.040 --> 21:10.960
yeah so it's pretty cool that I did that I guess we were a great group and I was

21:10.960 --> 21:17.640
like yeah I guess it was pretty yeah Joel you got us and that's you wait you

21:17.640 --> 21:31.400
got to listen listen here Joel's gonna sue us now right so good it's

21:31.400 --> 21:37.520
infuriatingly good does everyone shut up

21:37.520 --> 21:53.040
thank you Paul thank you God it's good I think if you lay down some sick shit

21:53.040 --> 21:56.880
like that yeah play it next time she gets in the car I think you do have to

21:56.880 --> 22:02.080
play it first because if someone told me I made an acapella album and now I'm

22:02.080 --> 22:06.840
gonna play it for you oh boy I would need a fucking Texas Instruments

22:06.840 --> 22:14.160
graphing calculator to figure out my facial expression I could not no way no

22:14.160 --> 22:17.760
how could I have the right face for listening to that but if you're already

22:17.760 --> 22:22.160
listening to it you're like this is good yeah I like this Connor here's my advice

22:22.160 --> 22:26.560
you're gonna walk into this backwards you're going to be like whatever the

22:26.560 --> 22:30.920
conversation is if it's about like you know projects you've worked on hobbies

22:30.920 --> 22:36.340
you've had whatever you can say like well yeah I one time you know I put

22:36.340 --> 22:40.640
together an acapella album and they're like you did and I get pretty good they

22:40.640 --> 22:44.160
are inevitably going to ask to listen to it and you're like I mean I guess we

22:44.160 --> 22:50.000
could which at that point it's great but if you went into it saying I'm going to

22:50.000 --> 22:54.960
play this but you can't do that no no the next few seconds between that

22:54.960 --> 22:59.360
announcement until you press the play button are going to be the worst seconds

22:59.360 --> 23:05.040
of their life and here's the thing trust me from experience please don't try to

23:05.040 --> 23:11.880
stream it because I guarantee oh god it will play two seconds and just wait

23:11.880 --> 23:14.840
hold on it's just buffering hold on one second oh no I think oh there's some

23:14.840 --> 23:18.120
gonna hold on wait the Bluetooth isn't it it's only coming through the left so

23:18.120 --> 23:23.840
you're only getting hold on let me go get my big speakers hold on I swear I

23:23.840 --> 23:28.800
charge this beforehand Paul was oh Paul wanted us to mention that he used to be

23:28.800 --> 23:31.840
in an acapella group called da Vinci's notebook if you've never heard their

23:31.840 --> 23:35.440
shoehorn with well they're selling it they just don't get together anymore you

23:35.440 --> 23:39.760
don't leave an acapella band you've probably heard them because you

23:39.760 --> 23:45.480
downloaded a line wire or Kazaa version of shoehorn with teeth that said it was

23:45.480 --> 23:49.200
by moxie fruvis and it turned out it was actually by Paul yeah so that's where

23:49.200 --> 23:56.000
what a pleasant surprise yeah what a treat for you another question

23:56.000 --> 24:08.160
we got a haunted doll watch okay okay no sorry

24:08.160 --> 24:15.080
ironically I was watching Ghostbusters afterlife backstage let me just move

24:15.080 --> 24:21.360
over to crowns Travis watches movies so that he can tell you how he doesn't like

24:21.360 --> 24:27.160
them yeah a lot guys I've heard Travis Travis has been watching Ghostbusters

24:27.160 --> 24:32.080
afterlife for four days and I have I have ADHD yeah I've heard four

24:32.080 --> 24:38.000
different reviews of the film based on how much he has watched yeah so he's

24:38.000 --> 24:41.240
like so I watched the first 20 minutes of this movie and it's like let me tell

24:41.240 --> 24:45.720
you what I think and then he has done that to me three other times like so

24:45.720 --> 24:49.600
I'm 75 minutes in and here's where I'm at yeah I didn't want to hear about it

24:49.600 --> 24:56.760
at all my experience changes as the movie goes on boy you are seriously

24:56.760 --> 25:00.040
looking like something on your phone yeah it's got me really worried no don't

25:00.040 --> 25:09.480
worry about it don't worry about it okay so I this is my version upon a doll and

25:09.480 --> 25:23.560
whenever I do a bit I like to gamify it so I like to call this the doll is right

25:23.560 --> 25:28.760
okay okay so here's what's gonna happen I will describe the dog and you'll see

25:28.760 --> 25:35.600
the pictures and then you guys are gonna guess the price of the dog good Paul

25:35.600 --> 25:42.560

time she will give you vivid dreams always come to me during meditation whoa

26:12.960 --> 26:18.640
the scale is so different from what I thought it was the first couple looked

26:18.640 --> 26:23.960
like a doll and now it's on some firm gully shit and is very responsive to

26:23.960 --> 26:30.400
any way you would like to communicate I don't need that she can be very

26:30.400 --> 26:36.080
mischievous and likes to be spoiled her favorite thing is to hide small items no

26:36.080 --> 26:40.720
worries I have always been able to find whatever she is hidden because she

26:40.720 --> 26:47.340

my mentor was my late great-aunt Maude some say she was a witch I believe she

27:11.880 --> 27:17.040

have questioned a spirit not interacting with them in items they have purchased

32:04.640 --> 32:09.440
from other sellers spirits have their own personalities sometimes it does take

32:09.440 --> 32:13.400
them a day or two or even longer to adjust their new surroundings they don't

32:13.400 --> 32:18.200
do parlor tricks and if they choose to hold off on interaction thing it is

32:18.200 --> 32:24.200

choice for me like if you say all of our products then it just sounds you're

49:35.800 --> 49:43.840
having a bit of fun this sounds accusatory targeted at me a sandwich the

49:43.840 --> 49:47.240
mountainous half pound roast beef sandwich isn't the only place the old

49:47.240 --> 49:53.720
spice has been lately what beef tastic brouhaha began this past week when the

49:53.720 --> 49:58.340
old spice guy made his presence known on the streets of New York handing out sweat

49:58.340 --> 50:04.920
defense dry sprays Arby's gift cards and these meat sweat defense kits it's like

50:04.920 --> 50:14.080
if someone handed you an antidote and then was like and also here is poison

50:14.080 --> 50:20.400
decked out in an old spice and Arby's SUV which I assume will be in my

50:20.400 --> 50:25.940
driveway at some point through hooker through crook the old spice guy even

50:25.940 --> 50:31.360
ended up in the meatpacking district to tell them that Arby's has the meats and

50:31.360 --> 50:36.680
they said no you don't actually we know we pack them here and send it to you

50:36.680 --> 50:41.520
you have some of the meats what you can't claim all the meats whether you

50:41.520 --> 50:46.260
are eating a meat mountain or a half pound roast beef sandwich or just a

50:46.260 --> 50:51.360

channel Shrek right channel got a dual screen moment okay yes no one

01:01:52.840 --> 01:02:09.240
I'm starting to feel like this is our greatest live show ever all right I

01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:17.320
want Amanda just said no thank you man okay hello hi we're a podcast what's

01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:23.000
your deal um so I'm Kate I sent in the question okay I'm Kate hands in the

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:33.800
audience I send in the question about rabbit okay so I and also let this be a

01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:36.720
lesson to you if you ever come to another live show you know like I think

01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:43.080
my question will get answered this is the new baron like this is the okay no

01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:49.240
pressure Kate oh yeah for sure um so I volunteer at a 4-h county fair every

01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:55.680
year I'm the rabbit superintendent and and this year I got to attend and as the

01:02:55.680 --> 01:03:01.880
rabbit judge and you were the super attendant and

01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:11.400
the problem is is that today was the breed class and I had to judge all these

01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:16.400
today yeah so I had to pose them all and you have to go through every animal in

01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:21.760
the barn and there was a problem that arose because when you're handling all

01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:27.620
of the female rabbits and all of the male rabbits the male rabbits smell the

01:03:27.620 --> 01:03:33.240
female rabbit and they start sort of just going to town on your hands arms

01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:41.440
body and you hey you've showered since then right yes very very very much I mean

01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:46.840
I don't have dirt all over me so you can also tell from that so sorry that you

01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:55.520
had to say that actually from now on if you're at if you're at one of our live

01:03:55.520 --> 01:03:59.280
shows I would like everyone to just mention I don't have dirt all over me

01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:05.040
anyway it's an audio medium if you're listening to this later I do not have

01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:10.840
turtle so what I mean the rabbits are getting down is it the problem yeah so

01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:15.560
they do completion if I remember they go into completion yes multiple times

01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:22.520
throughout the show wait multiple times per rabbit okay it's what rabbits are

01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:28.560
known for is how many jizzes they like carrots they like carrots they give me

01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:34.960
eggs on Easter there's a lot of clarifying so a lot of other things I

01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:40.760
know about rabbit rabbits other than they like to jizz a bunch yeah so

01:04:40.760 --> 01:04:45.560
basically I mean there's a whole show circuit and there's like people who do

01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:49.040
like judging and stuff I thought you're about to say there's people who walk

01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:54.680
them off he can't he can't show right now no one's whacked him off yeah give

01:04:54.680 --> 01:05:02.400
me a second hey okay I'm sorry to ask this question I have to know yeah

01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:15.440
deeded duck points will that happens or do you add bonus I did I did give all

01:05:15.440 --> 01:05:21.800
the rabbits that finished I did end up giving them all blue ribbons I didn't

01:05:21.800 --> 01:05:26.440
it's how it worked I didn't deduct points they were all good rabbits what

01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:31.560
can I say I hope you were locking this in your memories and amber because no

01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:37.960
one will hear it again oh god okay okay so my big question of course I thought

01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:48.440
yeah how do I stop the rabbits from jizzing on me yeah for sure for sure

01:05:48.440 --> 01:06:06.320
but hold on is there a is there is there a how high does the bunny hop contest

01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:11.000
that's not not as a part of this no that's it that's that 4h after hours

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:14.840
that's where the bedding began alley what are the can you give me one of the

01:06:14.840 --> 01:06:20.120
other criteria that they are judged by it's like a dog breed show so like you

01:06:20.120 --> 01:06:27.320
know the good the shape the density okay how do I how dense is the like you like

01:06:27.320 --> 01:06:33.400
a you like a thick boy it just you know the body okay not yeah the rabbit the

01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:37.640
rabbit if there was a people by the way if you're listening this later there

01:06:37.640 --> 01:06:42.000
are people close to us who have physically turned their bodies yeah they

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:48.600
are recoiling they're no longer oriented towards us performing they're oriented

01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:54.520
away from us to other directions that's good I love that if there was a how high

01:06:54.520 --> 01:06:59.720
can the bunny hop contest do you think there would be a judge stopping the

01:06:59.720 --> 01:07:04.560
bunnies from hopping so high and saying don't hop so high bunnies well of course

01:07:04.560 --> 01:07:12.680
not this is a sorry y'all invented what is essentially a jizzing contest you

01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:22.520
cannot we have to stop talking about rabbit jizz now hey hey next time judge

01:07:22.520 --> 01:07:30.200
the boy bunnies first does that help hey does that help though sure yeah okay

01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:40.040
thanks everyone big hand for Kate hello hello I'm Owen hi Owen how are you oh

01:07:40.040 --> 01:07:49.160
all right um I sent in a question about getting permabanned yeah yeah all right

01:07:49.160 --> 01:07:57.040
from the 4-h rabbit show I guess chanting is not oh and how did you get

01:07:57.040 --> 01:08:02.320
first what's the name of the bar it's space room it's over on Hawthorne well

01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:07.640
hold your horses yeah hold on a second you don't know this tale of what oh and

01:08:07.640 --> 01:08:15.640
what happened my birthday was Wednesday and so so I went out and drank with some

01:08:15.640 --> 01:08:20.440
of my friends cool ended up at the space room end of the night comes around last

01:08:20.440 --> 01:08:25.240
call happens my friend Charlie decides to whip his pants down in the middle of

01:08:25.240 --> 01:08:30.440
the bar wait no it's not as bad as you think gone super bad and I end up

01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:35.640
getting super fucking and oh and you have to finish with like they mooned you

01:08:35.640 --> 01:08:41.280
not just whip their pants down yeah there's two sides okay dumbed it out on

01:08:41.280 --> 01:08:46.000
like in front of our table pressed ham mooning okay no this is this is very

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:51.520
jumpy now could also I'm just saying this is like a tasteful mooning this is

01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:57.640
not the first time he's done this okay yeah this happens in a lot of bars no

01:08:57.640 --> 01:09:01.960
he's okay cuz I'm gonna say some mean stuff about wait but that got you

01:09:01.960 --> 01:09:07.200
perma-banned the target not perma-banned not you I'm perma-banned

01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:11.400
this is what I'm saying that's messed up that's not fair you didn't do anything

01:09:11.400 --> 01:09:30.360
I don't hold on did you did you did you laugh though oh of course I did now I

01:09:30.360 --> 01:09:34.240
also think the context that it was last call actually should provide some

01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:39.720
leniency because that happens at 930 p.m. right that's a perfect 230 in the

01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:44.360
morning like yeah we love it I mean did this bar did this bar serve Charlie yes

01:09:44.360 --> 01:09:49.480
you could make the argument then that they are culpable right like you gave

01:09:49.480 --> 01:09:53.960
this person so much boost that they're mooning people you got a kind of you

01:09:53.960 --> 01:10:01.400
provided windows right I how do you get perma-banned have you tried to just walk

01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:17.760
back yeah all of the bartenders know me I used to live like two blocks no it's

01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:21.640

01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:06.000

01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:14.080

everybody cheered at it wait a minute there are definitely worse things that
