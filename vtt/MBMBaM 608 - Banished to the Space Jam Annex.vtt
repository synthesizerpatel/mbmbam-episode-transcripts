WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

00:05.760 --> 00:10.580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

00:11.480 --> 00:17.660

02:58.280 --> 03:02.200
It's unbelievable the bargains are unbelievable

03:02.200 --> 03:09.680
What's the goal Justin the goal well Trav? Here's the goal, but the goal is for us to not be destitute and that

New upgrading and boosting donors uh-huh right now as we record this it is three thousand six hundred eighty three

03:33.400 --> 03:35.960
So it's a little ways to go just shy

03:35.960 --> 03:41.640
We've got a little ways to go and the worst part is if we don't make it Griffin Mackerel will be cuckolded

03:41.800 --> 03:49.280
By lightning McQueen racing legend lightning McLean I should I ask Rachel before we commit to this bit

03:49.280 --> 03:50.960

But I can't imagine anyone

04:07.760 --> 04:12.800
Not being down the clown when I think legend lightning McQueen yeah when I talk to him. He's like

04:13.580 --> 04:18.360
You know the real nitrous in my tank is consent. Yeah, and he loves it. Yeah

04:18.360 --> 04:21.800
It's wild for this enthusiastic consent to he's very clear on that

04:21.880 --> 04:26.680
Hey, how do you feel about lightning McQueen and then I should add like this is for the this is for the show

04:52.180 --> 04:54.100
Normally our show is just like this

04:54.100 --> 04:59.640
Yeah, three brothers talking a bunch of nonsense and it's for you and we don't have to do it

04:59.640 --> 05:04.780
I mean there it is. I should clarify. He's the red car from I think she would know that

05:05.340 --> 05:10.120
She knows it. You have a young boy in your home. We're not we're not a we're not a fucking cars fan

05:10.120 --> 05:15.660
That's right. Really. That was a geek check. I don't want any cars people. You gotta get that shit together my man

05:15.660 --> 05:19.780
It's a great movie. It's not the second one so much. Oh

05:20.460 --> 05:25.900
Man, but wouldn't you rather be cuckolded by lightning McQueen than tow Mater? You know what I mean? Yeah

05:31.540 --> 05:37.220
Now if it was the Hudson sexiness of a cars if it was Hudson Hornet I fucking get it man

05:37.220 --> 05:38.740
Okay

05:38.740 --> 05:43.540

05:44.180 --> 05:45.340
Hi

05:45.340 --> 05:48.460
It's Jesse Thorne here. I regret to inform you

I've discontinued the promotion in which if we don't meet our goal griffin back where we will be cuckolded by lightning McQueen

05:54.460 --> 05:55.580
unfortunately

05:55.580 --> 05:57.940
That is not gonna come out

05:57.940 --> 06:08.380
Should I ask if there's another character in cars that she is is there any of the Pixar canon but non-human car from cars? That is good for you

06:09.740 --> 06:12.140
What about the dinosaur from Toy Story?

06:12.860 --> 06:18.720
Or the text from Toy Story. I don't know why I'm the one sort of jumping on this grenade

06:18.720 --> 06:21.820
So there's a lot of really amazing marital aims in this

06:21.820 --> 06:28.980
And what Griffin it would be weird if I was asking your wife if she would have sex with lightning McQueen. Come on. Yeah, think about it

06:31.340 --> 06:34.800
Okay, she says the dino is definitely for me so that they're now there are stakes

06:35.020 --> 06:39.600
Okay, can I read you guys some names of characters in cars? I would love nothing more

06:40.460 --> 06:45.260
Strip weathers. Nice. She kicks. That's a good one. Finn Mcmissile

06:46.300 --> 06:48.820

I love that. That's surreal. That's cool. Miles Axelrod. Yeah. Hell yeah

06:54.740 --> 07:01.300
Let's see text Dinoco. I can't believe we all had two chances to name human beings

07:01.300 --> 07:06.720
I know we we beefed it so hard and we didn't go with Corey Turbowitz. Yeah

07:07.180 --> 07:10.140
If I had had a boy it was gonna be text Dinoco

07:11.100 --> 07:16.820
Bob Cutlass, that's a good one. Yeah, that's a good one. Oh my god guys rod torque redline

07:16.820 --> 07:22.180
I like that the most so far. It's really good Vladimir trunk golf. Yeah

07:22.780 --> 07:24.540
How did that happen?

07:24.540 --> 07:29.740
Well, that's gotta be the second one. That's gotta be the second one with all the spy shit in it. Jay Kirby Gremlin

07:30.580 --> 07:34.280
Yeah, that's gotta be another oh my god. There's one named Jeff Gorvette

07:36.540 --> 07:41.460
Maximum fun.org slash join again is the name of it the

07:41.460 --> 07:47.340
Way to go to rip clutch Gonski rip clutch Gonski, huh?

07:48.620 --> 07:50.620
Brent Mustang burger

07:53.100 --> 07:55.980
On your support now more than ever

07:56.980 --> 08:00.740
And this is the this is the content. This is what you wipe out

08:01.460 --> 08:03.460
Wait one more game

08:03.980 --> 08:05.500
punchy

08:05.500 --> 08:07.500
punchy punchy

08:07.820 --> 08:09.820
like PONCHY

08:09.820 --> 08:11.820
Yeah, Eugene

08:13.140 --> 08:17.020
Carbooski, okay. All right, and and and we appreciate yes

08:18.460 --> 08:23.300
I have a list of some of the recent people who have just joined up. We got Ernie Gearson

08:24.380 --> 08:26.380
Thank you, David Hobbs cap

08:26.820 --> 08:28.820
This is wild cuz these still sound

08:29.500 --> 08:35.380
Nigel Gearsley then to be fair this actually makes a lot of sense Griffin because we have been appealing to a very cars centric

08:35.380 --> 08:40.100
Demographic for the last like ten minutes. That's true. So it makes sense that

08:41.340 --> 08:44.720
This live feed of car of donors are also

08:45.740 --> 08:52.060
Anthropomorphic cars. Yeah. Yeah, but they can't rely on the cars from cars to support the content that you love

08:52.060 --> 08:57.540
That's only about 50% of our supporters. That's or like even if you like it, you still have to pay for it

08:57.540 --> 09:01.820
I don't love the food I get at McDonald's, but I still have to pay for it. I mean

09:01.820 --> 09:09.740
But bada bada bada they've gotten rid of a lot of my favorite fresh options like the Southwest salad and the chicken

09:09.740 --> 09:12.380
Snack wrap. Oh, they got rid of the chicken snack wrap

09:12.380 --> 09:19.420
They got rid of everything as part of a streamlining effort at the peak of the pandemic and they scaled back to a very

09:19.940 --> 09:24.820
Sort of like button-down menu without a lot of the fresh options not wild about that. Not

09:25.860 --> 09:28.140
Are they gonna bring it back? Oh, I don't know

09:28.140 --> 09:32.540
am I gonna reopen a supply chain to hit Justin up with his snack wrap or make the

09:32.540 --> 09:38.260
Southwest chicken salad that they may have called the Justin McElroy because I'm the only person that got the salad

09:38.260 --> 09:44.940
I got that from time to time. It's pretty good. Honestly, not bad if you like a fresh option. Yeah, I do

09:46.460 --> 09:51.940
This is an advice show obviously a fundraising effort. Hey, can we just be real for a second?

09:51.940 --> 09:56.120
yeah, please go the link and and pledge some money, but it's

09:56.120 --> 10:00.280
We just really need it would be really kick-ass really kick-ass

10:00.660 --> 10:04.280
Thank you, and then let us on Twitter if you do so we can say thanks

10:04.280 --> 10:09.140
At least one of us will I Griffin's, you know, kind of stepped away

10:09.680 --> 10:13.600
He's really focusing on his family right now and his ministry. Yeah. Well, I've been working

10:13.600 --> 10:16.300
I did get hired at focus on the family and thank you guys for

10:16.880 --> 10:21.140
Announcing that here and I know some people are gonna be p.o'd about that and try to get me, you know

10:21.140 --> 10:27.060
Uh, try to get me canceled, but please don't I thought it was focused features. You got hired at

10:27.060 --> 10:33.940
Oh, I got no that was a short sort of thing and then they found out how just I don't like anything

10:34.300 --> 10:36.300
Secular in films. Yeah, okay

10:38.180 --> 10:41.900
Yeah, and they are all about that life so it was a short-lived partnership

10:43.300 --> 10:49.740
What do you what are you focusing on over and focus on the family Griffin daughters this month its daughter month

10:49.740 --> 10:54.320
It's all daughter content all the time. Just McGee and me

10:55.060 --> 11:01.700
Let's start time with daughters. Yeah. Well, that's when I showed thank you so much. No, this was the start

11:02.460 --> 11:05.760
What this was the start this is the start you're there you're in it

11:05.760 --> 11:12.860
I thought all that talk about Lightning McQueen betting Griffin's wife extramaritaly was all just for us

11:13.140 --> 11:17.020
It's kind of intramaritaly because Griffin would be a willing cuckold in this situation

11:17.020 --> 11:24.380
I would have to be because the because just he asked me to in the email. Can we please do lightning have a partner?

11:25.220 --> 11:33.420
What does like you speed is his wife? Oh, okay, but not like another car named speed. No speed is his wife speed racer

11:34.100 --> 11:36.100
No speed like speed

11:38.860 --> 11:44.200
While on a walk around my apartment complex I and you guys ever taken a walk

11:44.200 --> 11:49.080
I don't get out for a long time while out on a walk around my apartment complex

11:49.080 --> 11:52.120
I ended up noticing I feel like if somebody says they're out on a walk

11:52.120 --> 11:55.080
They're doing something that they didn't want to admit. You know, I mean like yeah

11:55.720 --> 12:00.200
I I ended up noticing a securely wrapped perfectly fine

12:00.200 --> 12:06.920
If not super melted package of Reese's chocolate on the floor next to a car and I walked what is Reese's?

12:06.920 --> 12:14.120
Chocolate Reese's Reese's chocolate. It's kind of like Reese's Cup Reese's Cup guys Reese's Cup. I figured that

12:14.320 --> 12:17.400
They don't just make a bar right? I'll make a chocolate. I mean

12:18.000 --> 12:21.100
They make a chocolate. It's just not on the bar. I

12:22.960 --> 12:29.500
Figured the chocolate must have fallen out of the car and the original owner hadn't noticed especially with it right next to the driver's seat door

12:30.200 --> 12:32.800
Seeing as I had been complaining about a lack of chocolate

12:32.800 --> 12:35.040
I

12:35.040 --> 12:36.800
See where this is going now

12:36.800 --> 12:40.160
Seeing as I have been complaining about a lack of chocolate two hours prior

12:40.160 --> 12:44.520
I figured this is a sign from the gods to eat it, but my partner and best friend

12:45.080 --> 12:50.880
Convinced me that eating mostly melted but securely packaged floor chocolate was not in fact the best idea I've ever had

12:51.080 --> 12:53.080
My question is this brother

12:54.360 --> 12:57.520
Yeah, I don't think we should go singing praises just yet

12:57.520 --> 13:03.700
My question is this brother should I have eaten the floor chocolate or should I have taken it home to refridge and eat later?

13:04.080 --> 13:09.180
Now that's from chocolate less Floridian. You have two options here that both in with

13:09.680 --> 13:11.920
You eating the floor chocolate, right?

13:12.400 --> 13:17.840
Well, it doesn't sorry that's the middle step in the journey that they will be going on

13:17.840 --> 13:22.680
I don't think your friends the instep will be not just the emergency room

13:22.680 --> 13:29.280
but one sort of bathroom in the emergency room complex that you are gonna you may as well bring a

13:29.640 --> 13:33.920
Pillow and a good book. I mean, I would love it if it worked that way

13:33.920 --> 13:41.000
But life isn't a fairly brothers comedy Griffin. The realistic answer is you'll eat the chocolate and it'll be fine. But

13:41.960 --> 13:45.840
For the next few days after uh-huh in the back of your head

13:45.840 --> 13:53.840
Yeah, every little creaking pop every little squish and squeeze in your body that you feel every every pang every floating

13:54.760 --> 14:01.460
Flash of light but in front of your eyes everything now, you're gonna wonder is this it is this

14:02.280 --> 14:09.080
My time is this the chocolate? Why did I do it? I did. I know where stores is. Why did I do it?

14:09.080 --> 14:12.200
Let's put the tiger on the table and yell at it for a second. Just okay 20 seconds

14:12.200 --> 14:16.320
There's a lot of food waste and food insecurity both in our country and in the world

14:16.320 --> 14:18.840
That's not what this is. That's not what this is. No, that's not what this is

14:19.360 --> 14:24.700
What here's there's two other factors here that I think have to be considered one other people were with you

14:25.200 --> 14:29.640
Right. So even if that chocolate is perfectly fine, even if you eat it nothing happens

14:29.640 --> 14:31.840
Even if you eat it and you never think about it again

14:32.040 --> 14:38.720
There were people who observed your behavior and maybe children maybe children

14:38.720 --> 14:44.160
Maybe even children they saw you and let's take all context out of the back

14:44.160 --> 14:47.560
They saw you pick something up off the ground and eat it

14:47.840 --> 14:48.800
Yeah

14:48.800 --> 14:53.000
With your only mouth with your only human mouth as far as I know

14:53.360 --> 14:57.520
And you put it in your own human body and put it on you have and you don't know the origin

14:57.800 --> 14:59.600
You do not know

14:59.600 --> 15:04.500
You know where this began. You only know if we're talking in terms of like

15:04.500 --> 15:10.860
An Antiques Roadshow, you don't know its provenance. You only know it's got a lot of patina on it and you ate it

15:10.860 --> 15:14.720
And then you ate it. That's what they do on Antiques Roadshow, by the way, if you haven't watched it lately

15:14.980 --> 15:17.440
They're doing a lot of just sort of eating the antiques

15:18.220 --> 15:22.860
Oh, this this is a old quilt from the Revolutionary War era made by Martha

15:23.820 --> 15:25.820
Washington and hold on one second

15:27.540 --> 15:31.380
Now it's nothing now it's energy it's cake house for Iran

15:31.380 --> 15:38.820
And the second thing to consider here is I'm starting to wonder now if the generation after us maybe even two generations

15:38.820 --> 15:39.580
I don't know how old we are

15:39.580 --> 15:47.140
Are they also being like drilled into their heads that people might inject drugs into candy or was did that stop after us?

15:47.140 --> 15:49.460
I think we were the last ones to get that

15:49.460 --> 15:50.140
Yeah

15:50.140 --> 15:55.020
I think everybody knows that we're just everybody else is kind of too busy to be injecting drugs into chocolate

15:55.020 --> 15:58.260
So who's just giving away free drugs like that? Well

15:58.260 --> 16:00.260
Oh

16:02.700 --> 16:04.700
Okay, don't eat I

16:05.140 --> 16:10.020
Feel like we can cut most of these quite kinds of questions off at the pass. Don't eat for chocolate

16:10.020 --> 16:15.580
I know that times are tough out there and like Travis said the big thing about food waste and I know all about that

16:16.380 --> 16:22.820
But and care and care care about care about it, but you can you can probably get chocolate

16:23.380 --> 16:25.820
That has been ethically sourced

16:25.820 --> 16:30.540
Do you know what I mean? That's not going to hurt you and your body

16:31.340 --> 16:38.700
You know because in the capitalist system we find ourselves in here you exchange your healthy body minutes for

16:39.140 --> 16:43.500
What I call chocolate dollars, which is money that you spend to get your own chocolate

16:43.500 --> 16:48.620
And if you hurt just regular dollars, sorry just dollars and if you hurt that body hurt that body

16:48.740 --> 16:52.900
Make sure that you don't hurt that body by eating chocolate you found on a floor

16:52.900 --> 16:59.380
Then you won't you will be too ill to earn more choco bucks, which is what you call chocolate dollars

16:59.380 --> 17:04.180
No, it also occurs to me reading the question again that in your supposition

17:04.180 --> 17:09.700
You found the chocolate and you were you decided this chocolate came from this car. It was next to

17:10.260 --> 17:16.020
So I could easily place this chocolate somewhere where the driver of the car could discover it once more

17:16.340 --> 17:18.900
But since the driver didn't know

17:18.900 --> 17:26.300
Ah finders keepers to high heavens. Do not eat this fucking chocolate. They already ate the chocolate didn't they?

17:26.340 --> 17:32.180
They ate the chocolate already. I do appreciate I do think that there is it's a little bit of security theater

17:32.260 --> 17:37.780
But the idea of like well, no, you don't understand. I put it in the refrigerator and solided it back up again

17:38.220 --> 17:40.720
So it's better now. It's safer now

17:41.220 --> 17:45.560
It was melty before and that would have been bad, but I put it in the fridge

17:45.560 --> 17:49.180
So I got cold so any germs on it got too cold

17:51.100 --> 17:53.100
Don't eat the chocolate and

17:53.100 --> 17:57.140
Do you all want to approach the wizard and ask him about his day?

17:57.420 --> 18:01.860
Yeah, I'll give us some cool advice on how to do a great thing

18:01.900 --> 18:06.300
Which is to say how to host a warrior cats theme birthday party. Are you kidding me?

18:06.800 --> 18:13.000
Yeah, serious so many people have sent this in over the months and I feel like I've been saving it for a special occasion

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
maximum fun dot org slash joint

18:16.120 --> 18:18.280
Preparing make sure your parents agree

18:18.280 --> 18:22.140
I don't necessarily have to tell your parents the theme of the party slash sleepover

18:22.140 --> 18:25.840
But you still need to make sure you can have one in the first place. This feels duplicitous to me

18:25.880 --> 18:26.400
Yeah

18:26.400 --> 18:32.520
Because if yeah if if one of my beautiful boys comes to me and says I want to have a sleepover and I'm like, yeah

18:32.520 --> 18:39.560
Sure, whatever and then I come in and there's big balls of yarn and everyone's got tails and they're fucking

18:40.160 --> 18:42.160
fighting and there's

18:42.160 --> 18:44.040
desiccated birds

18:44.040 --> 18:46.040
Yeah, I'm gonna be

18:46.080 --> 18:48.080
confused and probably upset

18:48.640 --> 18:51.000
and also just side note if my

18:51.400 --> 18:55.680
If one of my beautiful children came to me and said I want to have a sleepover and I said what's okay

18:55.680 --> 19:00.640
What's the theme and they said no theme I would also be disappointed. That's true, right?

19:00.640 --> 19:06.760
It's gotta have everything you're gonna throw away that chance to have a themed party of any sort. Really? Yeah

19:07.320 --> 19:09.320
one time at the Minskers

19:09.320 --> 19:17.400
Basement we had a slumber party that ended they just kind of turned out to be an Austin Powers themed sleepover

19:18.080 --> 19:21.680
like it wasn't that was not the intention, but then we all showed up and

19:22.640 --> 19:27.040
We were all just sort of like in the headspace of thinking about and talking about Austin Powers a lot

19:27.040 --> 19:30.640
And then we watched Austin Powers and it was just like oh, it's we are

19:30.920 --> 19:37.360
We are accidentally having an Austin Powers themed sleepover party and it was one of the best ones that I've it was one of the best

19:37.360 --> 19:42.480
Austin Powers sleepover parties. I think I've had and Griffin didn't make you horny, baby. No

19:43.640 --> 19:50.160
Start planning early. Even if you plan extremely early when not when not anyone is even thinking about your birthday coming up

19:50.160 --> 19:53.960
This is good. You will have more time to think about what you really want to do

19:54.920 --> 19:58.680
But you can't I I'm of the opinion you start planning too early. Yeah

19:59.320 --> 20:03.620
To invite a couple people to the party see if they like the idea of having a warrior cats theme

20:03.620 --> 20:08.100
Oh, they won't they probably won't and then what kicking around a few different ideas

20:08.900 --> 20:16.740
if I could run past you kind of like having a clown or I don't know I thought about kicking everybody in

20:17.060 --> 20:23.860
The ass when they showed up. Yeah, or maybe warrior cats one of those definitely one of those you it's got to be

20:24.580 --> 20:30.360
Got you gotta switch those steps around right? You gotta ask people before you plan it, right?

20:30.360 --> 20:35.560
Otherwise, you're gonna get so far down the pathway. This is the first step in planning it

20:35.560 --> 20:40.520
This is the charts. I haven't begun to plan. We're just kind of blue sky and see if they would come

20:40.600 --> 20:45.880
Yeah, okay. So also this is more of like I'm just I'm just floating this idea

20:46.600 --> 20:52.400
Like this isn't necessarily an invite or a plan few different options. Just kicking them around if I did

20:53.120 --> 20:57.640
What would you say also step one keep your grades up keep those grades up or your parents?

20:57.640 --> 21:00.840
Will not let you dress up like kitty cats in a fight and desiccated bird

21:00.840 --> 21:05.640
No way decorate before your guests arrive decorate your houses with post your houses

21:05.640 --> 21:09.880
This is a this is we're having a progressive for your kids party. Nice

21:10.440 --> 21:16.680
Yeah, we go from one house to another to sort of represent the different phases in a kitty cat's life. It's a crawl

21:16.680 --> 21:21.400
It's a kitty cat crawl. It's a kitty cat crawl. Happy birthday to me. It's a kitty cat crawl

21:21.400 --> 21:27.280
Yeah, I need you to drive me and my other kitty cats over to Doug's house for the starters

21:27.400 --> 21:30.780
No, they're dry. Their dad says we can drink wild roses

21:33.280 --> 21:37.620
Okay, decorate your houses with posters paw prints or anything else that will complement the theme if you have party games

21:37.620 --> 21:39.620
Make sure anything you need for those games is ready

21:40.080 --> 21:43.280
spider web how is that specific to a warrior's cat is

21:43.960 --> 21:46.680
Preparation a big part of the Warriors cat ethos

21:46.680 --> 21:52.380
Well, Justin you think a warrior cat just like wakes up one day and like I'm a fucking warrior cat now

21:52.560 --> 21:56.340
No, that takes it takes a lot of work make each room a den

21:56.600 --> 22:03.240
So you have sort of different home bases for the Warriors den make small nests of green spider web or three pillows to make a sleeping

22:03.240 --> 22:07.980
Area when there's the leaders den for this you should choose the largest least occupied room

22:07.980 --> 22:11.160
The couch can be your bed cover with the spider webs or pillows

22:11.160 --> 22:18.560
Cover the floors in colored blankets or brown to give it that dirt and sand effect cover your cover your floors in brown

22:19.840 --> 22:26.640
Why why spider web such a prevalent theme here? Is that a big thing and warrior cats or cats just love?

22:27.640 --> 22:31.100
Have you been in the kind of woods that?

22:31.880 --> 22:36.020
Feral cats make their battlegrounds trash not for a long time very

22:37.360 --> 22:39.360
spooky and haunted and spiders

22:39.360 --> 22:43.920
You will need an apprentice tin. I like the idea of you having a den

22:43.920 --> 22:48.680
That's yours. So people show up and you're like fucking draped across your your

22:49.320 --> 22:56.120
Shays lounge like bear. Oh, you've brought me a what is this a nerf gun?

22:57.080 --> 22:59.080
Excellent put it on the pile

23:01.240 --> 23:05.760
Perfect choice. Oh, I would have preferred a saucy of milk

23:05.760 --> 23:09.040
Uh, there's other dens here, but Justin skipped ahead

23:09.040 --> 23:12.080
So I may as well join him in the future which is to say make the high rock

23:12.160 --> 23:18.800
Use multiple pillows stacked or use a chair or couch let the other cats sit below you on pillows or just spread out

23:18.800 --> 23:21.440
Oh, I'm sorry. What if I don't want to be

23:22.120 --> 23:25.340
The kitty cat who sits on the high rock at my own birthday party

23:25.340 --> 23:31.120
Well, I think that says a lot about you Griffin, but I also understand it cuz heavy is you know heavy head. Yeah, sure

23:31.120 --> 23:36.800
Joshua I don't care if it's fucking Plymouth Rock put the couch cushions

23:39.560 --> 23:43.840
I'm gonna make your friends go home. I don't care if it is your birthday. Those are the guest room pillows

23:44.080 --> 23:48.160
Use your pillows. What do you mean? Your pillows are the spiderwebs? Oh

23:48.840 --> 23:55.080
God Timothy's pissing everywhere and not for the normal reason. So can you please ask him to stop?

23:55.080 --> 24:01.520
I don't think the theme was Space Jam. I look like an idiot. I mean basketball themed treats. I'm here in a jersey

24:01.520 --> 24:08.040
I invited somebody who's like dressed up as bugs and I'm feeling like a fucking idiot and then some of your friends fucking

24:08.440 --> 24:12.260
Obliterated him cut him cut him wide open to our house guts put him on the fresh kill spot

24:12.260 --> 24:17.080
Which is the next step in the wikiHow article in the middle of camp place a cardboard piece that is cut out like a stump

24:17.080 --> 24:22.760
And decorated and when it comes to hunting the cats can put their fresh kill or stuffed animals on the stump

24:22.760 --> 24:24.760
This

24:24.880 --> 24:32.280
Sounds fun. I would that part got me that parts that part sounds good. I like that that this is my fresh kill

24:32.760 --> 24:35.800
It's a Mickey Mouse that teaches you the ABC

24:35.800 --> 24:40.820
It does it did skew a little bit Lord of the Flies there if I was a parent president this thing like oh

24:42.080 --> 24:44.080
Wait, what is it? Huh?

24:44.120 --> 24:47.200
Next oh, we're in the we're in the games section now

24:47.200 --> 24:53.520
Welcome each guest maybe with a dip of your head or a whisper of welcome to the home of the clans

24:54.560 --> 24:56.440
Probably not that one

24:56.440 --> 24:57.640
welcome

24:57.640 --> 25:01.560
We are East traveler. You got to really hit that ass on clans though

25:02.440 --> 25:09.520
Boy start with some roleplay once everyone has arrived. Why not pretend to be my interest you in some light roleplay

25:10.280 --> 25:13.400
My father has prepared some basketball cookies there

25:13.400 --> 25:17.100
We don't have it next door. There is a

25:18.220 --> 25:21.720
My twin brother Jebediah is having a basketball

25:22.320 --> 25:27.720
Themed birthday party you can go and try on some of Michael Jordan's shoes

25:28.280 --> 25:32.200
In retrospect I should have warned you about the theme of my party. Dr.

25:32.200 --> 25:37.280
Sniffle whiskers has committed the gravest sin and shall be banished to the Space Jam annex

25:38.120 --> 25:42.560
Start with some roleplay once everyone has arrived. Why not pretend to be warrior cats?

25:42.560 --> 25:45.560
Yeah, there's a pretty good fucking idea. Yeah

25:47.160 --> 25:53.160
Everyone could be one RP character roleplay and one real warrior. What the fuck does that mean?

25:53.160 --> 25:58.280
If you're sure showed Joshua showed up as Sylvester, he can walk between planes

26:01.240 --> 26:05.920
Man how is how is the Space Jam party Sylvester? That's pretty good

26:06.000 --> 26:11.440
They're we are watching they're over there watching the new Space Jam. Not my favorite, but the basketball cookies man, you're stepdad

26:11.440 --> 26:14.520
He cooks a mean basketball cookie. They made some

26:19.400 --> 26:25.400
Hey, don't forget I got that plant-based milk of the downstairs fridge that you want. You're always looking out Josh's dad

26:39.080 --> 26:43.720
Card around their neck. What? Yeah, why can't you just say Kevin go get the giraffe?

26:43.880 --> 26:49.980
Why do you have to like put a number cuz that's not a hunt Griffin. That's that's fetching and cats don't fetch

26:50.520 --> 26:55.360
Okay. Okay. Hey, it's different my cat that does actually fetch hair ties. That's fine

26:55.360 --> 26:58.920
Yeah, have a twisted version of egg toss have every

27:00.080 --> 27:04.840
Have everyone pair up and give each pair a spoon fill white water balloons up with dyed water

27:04.840 --> 27:08.760
What was so fucked up, dude?

27:09.760 --> 27:14.480
Are they what are they eggs? What is like? What is it? What does that have to do with the warrior cat mythos?

27:14.680 --> 27:19.560
Yeah, there's spells so that each one gets magic spells. They're different colors

27:19.840 --> 27:25.200
So red magic is like blood Matt the cat blood magic. Yeah

27:25.200 --> 27:34.520

27:36.520 --> 27:38.920
Collect that come up with a collector resource game in this game

27:38.920 --> 27:46.100
Each den will be removed of its items and hidden among the quote-unquote forest teams assigned each den must collect the items and amount wanted

27:46.680 --> 27:52.280
We're gonna search for the Queen. Hey Derek. Can I talk to you? Can we you're I think you've got a little deep

27:52.280 --> 27:56.020

You're a little deep in there Derek and we're kind of worried about you

27:59.280 --> 28:03.160
We're not playing the game anymore Derek. We're out of the game for a second Derek

28:03.160 --> 28:06.720
If you actually would go over to the space jam party, I feel like it would really

28:12.920 --> 28:20.400
Derek I do notice that you did hide Timothy's inhaler out in the quote-unquote forest and we do need you to tell us where that is

28:20.400 --> 28:27.240
No, that's my shiny special toy. No, he needs that for breathing and living. Do you have a way so I could chase?

28:28.920 --> 28:29.880

28:50.920 --> 28:53.520
730 when your mom's pick you up

28:54.240 --> 28:59.680
Once you've eaten, maybe you could play some warrior cat games with your friends on the internet having a good time

30:24.280 --> 30:27.360
I don't I told you about the berries and greens thing

30:27.360 --> 30:31.160

But you can pretend they are an elder or sick cat fine. Perfect. Oh, this is our sick. I'm not sick

30:37.680 --> 30:41.400

Eggplant muscles that I got from all the plants. They stretch them out of the Space Jam party

30:51.080 --> 30:52.520

It means the world this past year things have been pretty topsy-turvy

32:11.280 --> 32:16.480
For for well for all of us of me and Rachel. I had a baby this year and it's been

32:17.440 --> 32:20.280
Thanks. Yeah, I was waiting for any kind of acknowledgement

32:20.280 --> 32:25.160
I thought you already had a baby. We yeah, we did it. We doubled down and

32:25.800 --> 32:30.240
Too it's been it has been if I may get serious a little bit

32:30.840 --> 32:32.560
difficult we have had

32:32.560 --> 32:35.320
pretty inconsistent childcare between sort of

32:36.660 --> 32:38.660
nannies, you know getting sick and

32:40.240 --> 32:48.020
Daycares sort of closing basically every other week and the only reason why we have been able to sort of stay consistent is because we hired

32:48.020 --> 32:51.600
an editor last year Rachel Jacobs who's been doing an incredible job and

32:52.560 --> 32:59.720
All all of that is possible because of the support that we receive from from you all in the max fun drive

33:00.240 --> 33:06.480

33:15.100 --> 33:20.560
Have personal lives and spend time with our families and stuff and not have to

33:20.960 --> 33:28.000
stress a whole bunch about that balance because we have hired people that have helped us out using the money that you have

33:28.440 --> 33:35.240
Given us in past drives. So it's it is a very meaningful thing to us professionally personally

33:35.640 --> 33:39.900
Just just everything so and I'm also just a creatively things like

33:39.900 --> 33:48.540
either see going weekly and us like committing, you know, very hard to even expanding projects and trying to still come up with new things and

33:49.260 --> 33:54.580
Trying to do more streaming stuff on the YouTube all of that stuff is because we don't want to rest on laurels

33:54.820 --> 34:00.840

35:19.260 --> 35:21.980
There's videos where we riff over old movies

35:23.580 --> 35:29.340
Yes, there's visual movies there's a demo of a song that Lin-Manuel Miranda wrote for us

35:29.340 --> 35:36.140

35:36.620 --> 35:42.820
episodes that our wives recorded together there's a griffins vor podcast that he recorded one episode of

35:44.180 --> 35:48.180
There's a video home movies of us. There's our

35:49.140 --> 35:51.220
absolute debacle of a

35:51.900 --> 35:57.220
Show in Detroit about Star Wars that I actually did not realize had been

35:57.220 --> 36:01.020
uploaded and I'm now not as enthused about people going to

36:01.860 --> 36:06.220
Enjoy this there's last year. We did an episode called Pranky Doodle Dandy. Was that last year?

36:06.220 --> 36:08.220
Fuck that was good. Yeah

36:08.940 --> 36:14.740
No, no, no Pranky Doodle Dandy was 2020 freaky fun day freaky fun day. We switched all the bits around

36:14.740 --> 36:18.660
That's right. And then this yes this year we developed the next great McElroy

36:19.100 --> 36:25.900
Creative project and god damn it. Joel was on board. You gotta listen folks. You gotta get it. You gotta yeah

36:25.900 --> 36:30.980
It's horrifying and incriminating. Did we announce the other thing that we recorded or is that secret stuff?

36:30.980 --> 36:34.080
You know what? I think by this point, hopefully by this point we've hit it though

36:34.660 --> 36:41.180
We recorded we took the transcript from an episode and then assigned the part we switched brothers

36:41.620 --> 36:47.300
And yes, it's a remix. Yeah, it's a remix. Yeah, and so like I think I did Griffin Griffin did me

36:47.300 --> 36:54.580
I think Justin was me. I was no I Griff Travis was Griffin and I know you were Travis

36:54.580 --> 36:59.900
I was Griffin and Travis was me and we like did it it was

37:00.460 --> 37:05.900
It was the dumbest silliest things. I was in a fugue state for most of it

37:05.900 --> 37:09.180
It was genuine by the end. I was crying laughing and just crying

37:09.180 --> 37:13.620
I was like whacked out on cold medicine when we first read it

37:13.620 --> 37:20.300
And so hearing Justin sort of try to capture that in his performance was a true delight

37:20.300 --> 37:26.420
I mean, you'll only hear that one if we hit the goal to release it and to you if you are max fun supporter

37:26.420 --> 37:31.540

37:38.980 --> 37:46.340
Turned classic board games into an RPG and it hasn't taken the world by storm yet. So it'll get there. It'll get there. Okay

37:46.340 --> 37:54.460
Uh, please maximum fun org slash join. Let's let's do another question while they go to that link and do all their stuff

37:55.540 --> 38:00.060
Okay. Sorry. I've moved away from the well, I was thinking maybe we could have some interactive fun

38:00.780 --> 38:04.820
And everybody could join in and play along at home. No

38:05.580 --> 38:07.580
You're done with this one like

38:08.020 --> 38:12.140
Here's here's the thing that I thought about cuz on on last week's

38:12.140 --> 38:16.640
A wonderful. Yeah, Griffin and Rachel talked about me and how great I am

38:17.260 --> 38:19.220
And I was like, that's really nice

38:19.220 --> 38:24.700
And so I thought we could play a little play along home where I asked you trivia questions specifically about me

38:25.180 --> 38:31.780
Right see how well you two and the audience at home know me. Do you think they'll like that?

38:31.780 --> 38:33.780
I think I will

38:33.780 --> 38:38.140
Right, but you're one and they are many. Yeah, I'm like one third of the host

38:38.140 --> 38:41.980
So at least 33% of the hosts are on board with it when you think that way

38:41.980 --> 38:47.220
Well, we know you pretty good. So let's get through this about as fast as we can

38:47.660 --> 38:51.620
Okay, what is Travis McElroy's favorite dessert?

38:52.540 --> 38:54.540
cheesecake

38:54.540 --> 39:00.980
That's very good Griffin that was right off the bat. Yeah, I don't need it. I don't cheesecake. Sorry

39:00.980 --> 39:05.460
There's two points for each. I don't think that Justin should get points because he's

39:05.460 --> 39:09.980
Like I don't like Griffin it was clearly I like okay

39:09.980 --> 39:15.180
Should we start? Well, should we restart the call to try to get this lag fix because maybe we should do a count again

39:15.180 --> 39:17.660
Just see how bad the lag is. Okay, so juice go ahead

39:17.660 --> 39:22.100
I don't think we need to know go ahead and just do the count so we can tell that the lag is good

39:24.020 --> 39:26.020
One

39:26.700 --> 39:28.700
Two yeah, that's pretty bad

39:28.700 --> 39:34.300
Yeah, I told you juice you responded to what I said just then really fast so quickly

39:34.300 --> 39:39.220
That was really maybe he was just ready to say it. Okay, what size shoe does Travis wasn't that fast?

39:40.060 --> 39:43.220
What size shoe does Travis wear ten and a half?

39:44.220 --> 39:50.580

39:50.580 --> 39:54.260

I've got petite feet. Well, do you notice how you fall over a lot when there's like we see feeling up TV?

40:07.340 --> 40:09.100

40:09.100 --> 40:12.460
What do you rock? What do you rock? I'm the 10. I'm the so

40:13.380 --> 40:18.700

40:50.660 --> 40:53.380
Draught there, you know, they love that. So

40:53.820 --> 40:58.300

There's the Triforce. Yes. Yeah, six. We all got that one. That should've been easier to remember. Yeah, it was

42:02.780 --> 42:06.620
Are we forgetting? Oh, yeah, so I got that all you can do is all you can do the pineapple

42:06.620 --> 42:12.900
I have the microphone with flowers. I have the wine glasses cheersing with flowers

42:12.900 --> 42:19.340
I have the d20 that's all 20s that says I do that. I have the sheriff's star that says, you know morons

42:34.940 --> 42:39.220
Nine ten eleven. I got it perfectly. Eleven. I actually said eleven

42:39.220 --> 42:44.700
Okay, then you got it Griffin wins, I guess how are you how are you guys not more impressed by that?

42:44.700 --> 42:47.020
I guess the number of tattoos on my brother's beautiful body

42:47.020 --> 42:51.420
I also would have accepted twelve because I had the one on my back redone. I would have accepted twelve

42:51.700 --> 42:55.340
Okay, but it is exactly eleven, which is you win

42:55.340 --> 42:59.980
I know your beautiful body so good, but not this feet the feet are a little bit. I try not to look at your feet

42:59.980 --> 43:04.420
Yeah, I get that. They're so large. I got you this best brother trophy Griffin. All right

43:04.420 --> 43:08.900
I also got you a best brother because you're both the best brothers

43:09.460 --> 43:12.340
Participation trophy thanks for our first actually. Yeah

43:13.460 --> 43:15.460
Participation trophies, huh?

43:16.420 --> 43:24.380
Made ahead of time. How did we not talk about Jeff Foxworthy making a participation trophy joke in 2022 in his new net?

43:25.420 --> 43:32.020
Yeah, they really there's a thing that went it did go viral online because it was Netflix is a joke

43:32.020 --> 43:34.700
Which I guess is they're like comedy thing. They tweeted out

43:35.380 --> 43:41.420
Clip or some screenshots with captions of Jeff Foxworthy's new special where he said, you know

43:41.420 --> 43:47.240
It's funny back in my day. If you wanted a trophy when you're competing you had to win

43:52.260 --> 43:57.060
That's the good shit right there baby, it's not even like

43:57.060 --> 44:02.980
Like that observation itself is a decade. Yeah, so choice. There's a guy

44:02.980 --> 44:06.740
so there's a Geico commercial on the air right now where that fucking

44:07.820 --> 44:14.700
Slippery sexy gecko is talking to a woman at a diner and she's like I'm an introvert and he's like yeah

44:14.700 --> 44:21.380
Lots of people are introverts. She's like no, I'm a very I'm an introvert and that's very special and I'm over here

44:21.380 --> 44:24.220
I laugh so hard. I shit my pants. Yeah

44:24.220 --> 44:28.820
because it's like a Griffin who is normally an extra became

44:30.420 --> 44:36.580
Because it's like we're all busting up about how lots of people say they're introverts over. Oh, I did it again guys

44:38.580 --> 44:44.680
I didn't even have to laugh this time the Geico gecko made this shit come out with his awesome awesome introvert jokes

44:46.220 --> 44:47.180
Also

44:47.180 --> 44:53.220
Jeff also he's getting to a point now where I don't know that I trust that he's never gone a participation trophy

44:53.220 --> 44:55.820
He got a Netflix special in 2022

44:56.580 --> 44:58.580
That's your

44:58.900 --> 45:01.660
Around long enough. Yeah, you're still participating in life

45:01.660 --> 45:09.140
And so you have a Netflix we came back around we gave everyone else who was kind of problematic and bad a Netflix special

45:09.140 --> 45:13.180
So now we come back to you. Can you step up your problematic badness? So maybe I don't

45:14.220 --> 45:16.820
Don't think anybody's even gonna want to put in the legwork

45:16.820 --> 45:23.140
To do that to Jeff Foxworthy. It's like bigger and better. You know what I mean? Like he doesn't

45:23.780 --> 45:25.780
What do you accomplish?

45:25.780 --> 45:32.500
By by smashing Jeff Foxworthy like that by smashing him good. I don't I don't if you're a Jeff Foxworthy

45:32.500 --> 45:34.980
You might be irrelevant. Is that anything?

45:36.980 --> 45:38.980
I don't want to die

45:42.980 --> 45:44.980
He might be the one to give us our big break

45:44.980 --> 45:51.060
You guys ever think about that maybe he goes around also like if you look at how far we are from 20,000 new and upgrading donors

45:51.060 --> 45:53.540
Like I feel a little Foxworthy myself

45:56.020 --> 46:01.060
Maybe maybe we shouldn't peak not yes the EB peak. That's fair

46:03.460 --> 46:07.060
Okay, I have an alternate joke then how about this is like okay sure and out

46:07.700 --> 46:12.580
Participation trophies. He only gives them to people who are Foxworthy. Is that anything? I don't know

46:12.580 --> 46:20.100
It could be something we it needs about it needs about a good month worth of punch-up in the writers room

46:20.980 --> 46:27.660
But it's it's there's a seed there that I is. Oh, yeah, it's germinating. We've done one question

46:28.700 --> 46:31.860
Really? Yeah, let's do it. Is that right? Let's do a second question

46:32.900 --> 46:33.900
Okay

46:33.900 --> 46:37.460
Here comes the second question every day. I take a walk around my neighborhood

46:37.940 --> 46:41.140
Another what I mean another was weird

46:41.140 --> 46:43.140
Yeah, you know what it is

46:43.540 --> 46:47.660
Temperatures going on. Yeah, there is you want to get out there get your day a few

46:48.340 --> 46:52.540
Be careful that terminology there my dude. Yeah, you heard it, right?

46:52.660 --> 46:58.380
You're or is for our friends across your vitamin. There is your vitamin dick a

46:59.500 --> 47:02.740
Few days ago. I noticed a plastic Easter egg in my neighbor's grass

47:02.740 --> 47:06.500
It seems to have been missed during the Easter egg hunt is now six days past Easter

47:06.500 --> 47:09.020
At what point does it become okay for me to take it?

47:09.020 --> 47:13.180
It looks like there's something inside and I want it really bad this from hiding from the bunny in Dallas

47:13.180 --> 47:18.820
Is this another I did more handy person? This was not on trying to eat some ground

47:18.820 --> 47:24.600
I didn't organize these that way you're on purpose. Okay, listen, but at this year I did put

47:25.060 --> 47:28.920
Lego ninjas in the Easter eggs. Yeah, and by I I mean

47:30.060 --> 47:34.420
The bunny did it the bunny at my mother-in-law's house put 62 cents

47:34.420 --> 47:39.620
For grandkids for eggs each one had 62 cents in it when I said hey

47:39.900 --> 47:41.900
Why is there 62 cents in this egg?

47:41.900 --> 47:48.140
She said that's the amount of change I had that would evenly break up before four kids and I said Becky next time just two

47:48.140 --> 47:50.600
Quarters my kid doesn't need the taxes

47:51.980 --> 47:53.980
That is an absolutely

47:54.100 --> 47:59.780
Bonkers thing that I asked BB the other day if she was gonna get a job when she grew up and she said I don't

47:59.780 --> 48:03.060
Have to I already got money in my bank because she has about two inches worth

48:03.060 --> 48:08.660
In a like one of those big clear coke bottle bank about two inches worth of loose change and as far as she is concerned

48:08.660 --> 48:14.160
She is set for life. So yeah, two quarters probably would have accomplished the like I got money feeling

48:15.620 --> 48:21.140
Is it all from Becky all from Becky are they all Becky bucks just like I get changed and I'm like

48:21.140 --> 48:24.380
I don't want to put this in my point here. This is your allowance or whatever

48:24.380 --> 48:26.220
I did I do that

48:26.220 --> 48:31.700
I'm very cavalier with with like change that I get and I put it in the girls piggy bank and then

48:31.700 --> 48:37.540
Inevitably, I'm like going to the car wash or something like oh fuck. Hey guys, I'm sorry

48:40.020 --> 48:42.020
One day my daughter will catch me in bed

48:44.180 --> 48:47.940
Dad I called the police on you I saw that you took two dollars and fifty cents

48:47.940 --> 48:51.940
I think I had to I had to put air in the tires. Oh, yeah, tell it to the judge dad

48:51.940 --> 48:58.540
I think that this is a failing on the parents part or whoever has hidden these eggs

48:58.540 --> 49:03.480
Yes, you gotta take pictures on your phone every time you hide an egg. So that's a very least

49:04.180 --> 49:10.660
Account you need to know how much now that does get difficult to do when you're like the Easter Bunny told me

49:10.860 --> 49:16.980
He hid 32 eggs and we only got 31. So the Easter Bunny said so so hey, did you look over there?

49:16.980 --> 49:20.100
I got a strong feeling the Easter Bunny might have hid one

49:20.540 --> 49:25.420
But it is human nature to see a little what is essentially a treasure chest

49:25.420 --> 49:31.260
Oh, yeah, and want to know what's inside of it because maybe it is floor candy. Maybe it is for to grass chocolate and

49:32.140 --> 49:38.860
By which I mean a new cool futuristic house for ants. Yeah that they live in like whoa, this is so modern

49:39.300 --> 49:42.620
What is this Philip? I love it. It's so an egg for ants. Oh, that's

49:46.740 --> 49:50.260
What if it's a real always get my if it's a real Easter egg, oh

49:50.260 --> 49:57.240
Oh, and it like starts you on a whimsical journey through the fantastical where you partner up with the Easter money

49:57.300 --> 50:01.680
Like that's the thing is like this is if we approach more things with the wonderment and trust of a child

50:01.860 --> 50:06.280
We would go on more adventures because think about how many times you've seen something you're like

50:06.280 --> 50:10.940
I should pick that and you're like, ah, that's garbage and most of the time it probably is but moves a magical ring

50:10.940 --> 50:16.940
That would start you on a fantastical journey of love and acceptance like an Easter egg like a secret in a movie or a game

50:16.940 --> 50:22.620
Oh, it might be that to click on it. It's like how in the second Sonic the Hedgehog movie

50:22.740 --> 50:27.440
You there's like one scene where they're playing basketball and you can see

50:28.340 --> 50:30.340
dr. Eggman's balls

50:30.620 --> 50:36.820
Really and it but it's like a secret just for true fans just for true believers just for true believers in it

50:36.820 --> 50:38.260
Hey question asker

50:38.260 --> 50:44.580
Are you maybe telling a little tale on yourself when you say there seems like there's something inside you definitely picked it up and shook

50:44.580 --> 50:47.660
It right you weren't you weren't clocking from a distant

50:47.660 --> 50:53.040
You weren't using your x-ray vision on the egg hold and like you held it up to the light at the very least, right?

50:53.580 --> 50:59.500
Yeah, maybe they saw the wind blow it and it didn't move. So they just assumed like it's got some sort of

51:00.340 --> 51:02.460
Lego ninja or something inside of it

51:02.820 --> 51:08.420
Gee, have you guys seen the Easter bunny that they had up to the White House? No, was it a bad boy?

51:08.420 --> 51:12.520
Was it a bad one? This is my this is my fear. I'm gonna drop the picture now. I'm talking

51:12.520 --> 51:16.500
This is my theory is that there is no oh man

51:16.500 --> 51:23.940
Try to find a picture of the Easter bunny that does not bother you that is is non not a problem at all

51:24.580 --> 51:27.300
And it can't be done. That's not it

51:28.020 --> 51:32.700
That's not it. This was not it. This is it looks like a fucking

51:33.300 --> 51:39.340
Furry fan movie about the government. This is literally which by the way, I would watch the full

51:39.340 --> 51:45.540
God, yes, please. It is a person in a white bunny costume with a purple dress wearing a gigantic

51:46.140 --> 51:49.260
Mass and all standing at Jim Pulaski's podium

51:50.220 --> 51:57.420
At the white and strangely it looks like a crepe paper valentine on their chest. It's horrific. This is a terrible bunny

51:57.420 --> 52:00.220
They're all bad expression on their face is one of

52:01.220 --> 52:07.740
Absolute shock. Oh, I would have said condescension, but okay. No, I mean this is clearly clearly

52:07.740 --> 52:10.700
Dr. Jill Biden has said something here that is

52:12.220 --> 52:19.220
Unprecedented and these bunnies are not loving it. And also why are these bunnies wearing so much eyeshadow that now that's from 21

52:19.220 --> 52:21.980
Can you imagine if that bunny was at the podium when?

52:22.580 --> 52:26.780
Some like very serious news came out and they're like, I'm just being handed this. Hold on

52:28.500 --> 52:32.220
Now I actually just give I like this second bunny more

52:33.100 --> 52:35.940
But not a lot not a lot but more

52:35.940 --> 52:37.940
a

52:37.980 --> 52:42.460
Listener they're like community theater tricks. Like you cannot find a good Easter by that makes you feel good

52:42.460 --> 52:47.740
This is your bunny does look like a character designed from a rankin bass, right? The first one is

52:48.940 --> 52:55.020
Complex in in my feelings about that one, but the second one that's definitely being voiced by like a Joel Gray

52:55.700 --> 53:00.220
To tell me about the miracle of Easter and when Jesus came and gave us eggs

53:00.220 --> 53:05.660
We're at the mall. I asked Cooper if she wanted to get her picture taken with Easter Bunny and she said no, I

53:05.940 --> 53:11.420
Want him to be gone. That's god. That's good. Yes, that's accurate. Yes, correct way better

53:11.420 --> 53:15.300
Yes, what happened to me, which is my daughter wanted a picture with these running

53:15.300 --> 53:21.980
I was like, okay and she walked over and then she said you too daddy and I can't say no, so I had to

53:23.620 --> 53:29.160
Get my picture taken with this Easter Bunny and at that point like I know and the Easter Bunny knows and we're both there

53:29.160 --> 53:31.160
Doing this that it was a lie

53:31.720 --> 53:33.720
There was a lot of

53:36.280 --> 53:42.160
Sorry that I just say real quick the flowers in this White House picture are kind of sad

53:42.640 --> 53:44.940
That second one they're they're not well

53:45.520 --> 53:47.520
They're very droopy

53:47.520 --> 53:56.480
I want a month quad. Holy shit. Some fun org join. I want a munch

54:00.000 --> 54:04.320
Looks like the Easter Bunny is like one of the cabinet members and isn't

54:05.720 --> 54:07.720
They are droopy right? Thank you

54:08.400 --> 54:11.040
They're really true. This is weird. They're droopy. It doesn't matter

54:11.040 --> 54:15.140
This is a maybe they were taller and then you couldn't see and so they just smushed them down

54:15.140 --> 54:21.020
Maybe KFC is offering fried chicken bouquets for Mother's Day

54:24.020 --> 54:26.020
It's really so

54:26.180 --> 54:29.660

All right, I you know what I this is no secret. I love I love fried chicken. It's one of my favorite foods

56:07.300 --> 56:12.980
Not my favorite, but one of my favorites, but you know, I've always thought that it was missing a certain rose

56:13.420 --> 56:18.940
Flour and a leaf rubbed against it quality. Yeah that I think will really heighten it

56:18.940 --> 56:21.980
Oh this chicken tastes good, but it doesn't taste enough like it's been rubbed on

56:23.220 --> 56:28.020
Uncooked plants has it been close to plants and on them. Yeah getting some of the flavor dust

56:28.020 --> 56:31.620
Do I have to pull this out of a glass container?

56:32.980 --> 56:36.680
Myself and do it like some kind of I don't know weird monster

Are you asking me? Yes

56:41.380 --> 56:48.220
Okay, this is where I love these because I feel like if you're writing one of these maybe you get to a point where like I

56:49.340 --> 56:53.300
Can't just be that this is what I'm supposed to be doing all day today is writing this press release

56:53.300 --> 56:55.300
I can't I mean I've covered everything

56:55.300 --> 57:00.760
What else can I write? Let's see. Um pair the size lover's meal with a Kentucky fried

57:00.760 --> 57:05.320
But a kit for a DIY arrangement that you can make for mom with the food

57:06.680 --> 57:11.600
Provided by KFC and roses and supplies provided by pro flowers

This mother's day. I'm history can't see all you're giving me the skewers. I can pull over the fuck. I want. Oh, yeah

57:34.480 --> 57:40.920
Okay, don't tell me what kind of chicken then it's like certainly that's long enough. No, you're gonna have one more paragraph. Okay, boss

57:42.000 --> 57:46.280
Why bouquet you might ask well like any iconic duo?

57:46.280 --> 57:51.760
Kravitz, Bennifer, Brangelina, etc. What was the first one? Am I in that one?

57:52.400 --> 57:56.800
Kravitz? Is that me? Is that is that Kendall Jenner and Travis?

57:57.280 --> 58:04.360
Some something? I think it's me and Zoe Kravitz, but I'm confused. Okay Kravitz, Brennifer. Zoe Kravitz and I broke up.

58:05.360 --> 58:07.360
Janderson

58:07.360 --> 58:15.540
Brennifer is breakfast Jennifer Aniston. Waste to be fair is my favorite couple.

58:16.120 --> 58:24.500
Miss Aniston, can I come in? Not right now. I'm having Brennifer. That's what I call it. Have you ever seen Jennifer Aniston and breakfast together? Fucking happy.

58:25.880 --> 58:33.360
I've actually never seen them in the same room. Oh, maybe they're the same person. Yeah, I'm just saying Jennifer Aniston is breakfast.

58:33.360 --> 58:40.440
Hey ladies, let's go get some mimosa at Brunchifer. That's what I call it when I have brunch. Okay, Miss Aniston.

58:41.600 --> 58:46.640
So like any iconic duo you combine the two icons in this case

58:47.280 --> 58:52.040
Bucket and Bouquet and get Bouquet. They literally have a paragraph

58:53.160 --> 59:00.280
Explaining they're broken down busted little bit of needleages. Hey, here's how a portanto works buckle up

59:00.280 --> 59:04.560
Yeah, anyway, if you aren't already in fucking stitches, let's break it down

59:05.120 --> 59:12.200
Now do you guys we got if two famous Jennifer's started dating each other that like tabloids would just explode?

59:12.200 --> 59:14.840
Or do you think they would just like this is Jennifer Jennifer or?

59:15.440 --> 59:18.780
Jennifer Jennifer Jennifer Jennifer Jennifer of her

59:20.040 --> 59:26.360
Jennifer Jennifer Aniston and Jennifer Lopez together today and our brains exploded

59:27.160 --> 59:29.480
Nick Chavez the CMO for KFC

59:29.480 --> 59:30.800
the

59:30.800 --> 59:33.720
Sorry, his title is CMO KFC US a

59:35.000 --> 59:37.560
Regular bouquet of flowers is a good gift for mom

59:38.240 --> 59:43.760
Okay, but a sides lovers meal and Kentucky fried bouquet is a finger-licking

59:44.280 --> 59:50.200
Good way to take Mother's Day from a 10 to 11 one of the worst sentences. I've ever read my how was your mother's day?

59:50.200 --> 59:53.400
Oh, it's great. Honey. Was it finger-licking? Yeah

59:53.400 --> 59:59.720
Mom, tell me the honest truth was a finger-licking Nick continues with three sides four

59:59.920 --> 01:00:05.280
Buttery biscuits and the unforgettable truly fried chicken and flour table decoration

01:00:05.700 --> 01:00:12.840
Everybody is sure to get something they like to eat and mom is sure to smile for the mom who only has one partner and two

01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:14.560
kids

01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:16.560
the perfect choice

01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:17.640
since

01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:23.100
1952 KFC has been bringing families together for Mother's Day with a bucket of its world famous fried chicken

01:00:23.100 --> 01:00:26.080
KFC sells nearly four hundred

01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:34.120
Thousand buckets of fried chicken. So my chicken really making it one of the best sales days of the can't just be us alone

01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:35.560
No, right

01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:38.240
Well, I don't know. Yeah, it's gotta be international

01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:44.360
But Mother's Day is just a US holidays. Yeah, but I'm saying other places still you they don't they don't say

01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:48.600
Well, it's Mother's Day. No fried chicken today. Don't want to add to the numbers. Yeah, sure

01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:53.560
I asked my I asked my Japanese tutor if he was getting KFC for

01:00:54.680 --> 01:01:01.840
Christmas because that's a big tradition in Japan is getting your bucket of KFC for Christmas and he said oh no

01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:04.640
It's a sad chicken

01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:11.000
It's not wrong, maybe it's better over there we don't know

01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:17.280
But anyway, you can do that. That's now remember you gotta wait till the first. Is it the first now?

01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:19.280
Uh, no one knows

01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:25.960
It doesn't matter. I can't remember but like you got to do on the app to get your sides lovers meal

01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:30.280
And I guess they'll ship you the flowers. I can't imagine how this works

01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:34.520
I'm sure that there's a helpful person in app to walk you through it with no confusion

01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:38.280
Yes, and I'm sure if you go to any KFC in the country and tell them

01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:46.080
They get drippy and he's like I see you're trying to order from KFC. Can I help? It's me drippy

01:01:47.040 --> 01:01:49.040
the sentient gravy drip

01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:56.400
That's a great character that I don't like I've been talking about this for too long but drippy is actually pretty yes

01:01:56.400 --> 01:02:02.240
Well, I'd like to make an appointment the genius part. Yeah, what seems to be a problem? I can't get drippy off my phone now

01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:10.360
I'm on your finger. Yeah, I see you're trying to take a snap for your friend

01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:16.980
Yes, drippy, please. You should add the grease filter. That's I don't have that you do now. Oh fuck Wow

01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:20.300
Why are you deleting these texts? I'm telling Karen no

01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:27.280
It's not about that. It's not like that drippy. You don't know me. You don't know my life to me drippy drippy

01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:29.800
Yes

01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:34.040
You don't understand the sexual attraction these cars have these are the sexiest cars in town, okay?

01:02:34.040 --> 01:02:38.200
No, that's the one thing I do get Oh to be the oil in their engines

01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:40.760
drippy

01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:47.960
I don't think you burr. I don't think you burn clean drippy. I want to get pounded by their pistons. Jesus Christ

01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:51.160
I want to lube the carburetor

01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:54.280
