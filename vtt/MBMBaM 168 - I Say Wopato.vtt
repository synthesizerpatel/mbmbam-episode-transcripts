00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:50.560
Guys, I have breaking news from 22 Infinite Loop, or whatever the fuck Apple's address is.

00:50.560 --> 00:53.440
This is my brother. My brother and me in advice for the modern era.

00:53.440 --> 00:53.840
What's the news?

00:53.840 --> 00:59.440
Let me break out this fucking tech news. I'm trying to get the SEO right,

00:59.440 --> 01:02.400
and you're stepping on my... What are you doing?

01:02.400 --> 01:03.920
That's the breaking news sound.

01:03.920 --> 01:07.840
Yeah, that's the one we paid that studio thousands upon thousands of dollars to make,

01:07.840 --> 01:11.040
and you got so mad at us because you said it sounded like us going boop-boop-boop-boop.

01:11.040 --> 01:14.240
Here, let me hit play again, so you can do your breaking news.

01:14.240 --> 01:19.920
Breaking news from 22 Infinite Loop. It's the new model of everyone's favorite touchable.

01:21.040 --> 01:25.520
It's the guy phone. They changed it. It's the new model.

01:25.520 --> 01:29.840
Going along just like Dr. Pepper and 7up. This is just for men.

01:29.840 --> 01:35.040
Nope, that's not it. It's a little anthropomorphic phone. It lives in your pocket.

01:35.040 --> 01:39.440
It's just a little guy. He's just a little guy. He lives in your pocket,

01:39.440 --> 01:40.560
and he does all the things that iPhone 5 did.

01:40.560 --> 01:42.400
Is he saved like a phone or a guy?

01:43.520 --> 01:48.640
He is... Imagine a hybrid of both.

01:49.680 --> 01:53.920
Okay, wait. Okay, wait, hold on. So like a phone with arms and legs,

01:53.920 --> 01:56.240
or like a man with a phone for a face.

01:56.240 --> 01:58.400
It does. It has appendages. Okay.

01:58.400 --> 02:03.280
It has appendages, and it has a fleshy, scratch-resistant exterior.

02:03.840 --> 02:08.160
The thing you should know about the appendages is that they are extremely breakable.

02:08.720 --> 02:13.120
Oh my god. It's like Mr. Glass from Unbreakable.

02:13.120 --> 02:14.640
You'll never stop hearing about it.

02:16.000 --> 02:16.560
So be careful.

02:16.560 --> 02:23.040
You have a phone call. Must be nice. I don't have arms. I'm guy phone.

02:23.040 --> 02:27.040
Also, there's an unwrapped Starlight Mint in here. It's terrible in here.

02:27.040 --> 02:27.840
It sucks.

02:28.960 --> 02:31.280
Please don't leave your iPhone in a jar.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.920
I need you to have baggy pants, please.

02:35.360 --> 02:40.160
I need you to be the legend of baggy pants, and I need to ride around in there.

02:40.160 --> 02:43.200
And if you could wrap me in pillows, I'm so fragile.

02:43.760 --> 02:47.440
Did you want to apps? Did you want to Angry Birds on me?

02:48.400 --> 02:49.760
Angry Birds on my tummy.

02:49.760 --> 02:53.280
Angry Birds on my tummy? We used to Angry Birds all the time, Dave.

02:54.080 --> 02:55.440
My battery's dying!

02:56.560 --> 02:57.200
I'm dying.

02:58.720 --> 02:59.440
That's what I need.

02:59.440 --> 03:03.040
I need a guy phone that can tell me when I shanked it on Super Stickman Golf,

03:03.040 --> 03:06.160
even though I know. I know. I did. I know it.

03:06.160 --> 03:10.960
Oh, a little high. A little too much mustard on that tomato.

03:11.520 --> 03:12.320
Thanks, guy phone.

03:13.440 --> 03:15.040
I would like a guy phone that was sitting there like,

03:15.040 --> 03:18.320
hey, we're going karaokeing tonight. Don't you have to work tomorrow?

03:18.320 --> 03:19.680
You really think it was a good idea?

03:19.680 --> 03:23.600
Ew, gosh. I don't know. Better set an alarm on me now.

03:23.600 --> 03:25.360
So what I want is a tiny pocket nanny.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.080
Pocket nanny from the makers of guy phone.

03:28.880 --> 03:30.640
My name is Justin McElroy, by the way.

03:30.640 --> 03:32.080
I'm Travis McElroy.

03:32.080 --> 03:36.000
I'm Griffin McElroy. Ten thousand dollars for the guy phone.

03:36.000 --> 03:36.640
Does it make calls?

03:37.440 --> 03:39.760
They have a cheaper model. It does not make calls, no.

03:39.760 --> 03:40.160
It does not.

03:41.040 --> 03:46.160
They have a cheaper model that doesn't make calls or have apps, and it's just a small man.

03:47.840 --> 03:48.640
That's cheaper?

03:48.640 --> 03:52.400
It's called the guy phone Stephen.

03:52.400 --> 03:53.920
Neither are a phone.

03:53.920 --> 04:00.320
No, it's also not. It's not a living. It's a tiny. It's a little corpse.

04:00.320 --> 04:01.200
Guy phone does.

04:01.920 --> 04:03.520
Wait, guy phone Stephen is dead?

04:04.240 --> 04:09.360
Yeah, it's a dead. It's a dead pygmy corpse and you carry it around and it doesn't have apps,

04:09.360 --> 04:11.200
but you can still like play with it at the movies.

04:11.200 --> 04:12.320
Does it ward off evil?

04:12.960 --> 04:17.440
Doesn't do any of that. No, that's very, very nonfunctional, but it is cheaper than the guy

04:17.440 --> 04:20.400
phone, so just food for thought.

04:20.400 --> 04:23.600
Which as we've already established is pretty limited in terms of functionality already.

04:23.600 --> 04:27.360
Listen, your kids are going to ask for the fucking guy phone for Christmas.

04:27.360 --> 04:31.600
You don't have ten stacks to drop on each and every one of your seven kids,

04:32.480 --> 04:34.320
so I've got a cheaper option for you.

04:34.320 --> 04:36.160
We call it the guy phone Stephen.

04:36.720 --> 04:40.720
Guy phone Stephen comes in a lot of different colors. He is a dead corpse.

04:40.720 --> 04:45.120
He's a dead corpse. I'm not going to beat around the bush. We're selling you a corpse,

04:45.120 --> 04:48.640
but it's cheaper than the guy phone, so you'll be able to fill all those Christmas wishes.

04:48.640 --> 04:52.880
Great stocking stuffer. Guy phone Stephen's not going to complain about being stuffed.

04:52.880 --> 04:57.280
He's got the same features as the guy phone. Very breakable, very brittle appendages.

04:57.280 --> 05:03.040
I'm ready to make a buy. How much do I have to lay down for guy phone Stephen?

05:03.040 --> 05:05.680
Guy phone's $10,000. What's guy phone Stephen going to run me?

05:05.680 --> 05:11.360
$14.99. $14.99 and you can have your own guy phone Stephen.

05:11.360 --> 05:15.440
You are going to have to walk me through how we are not... I mean,

05:16.080 --> 05:21.360
where are you finding these Lilliputians for your experiments,

05:21.360 --> 05:23.360
and how are we not going to wipe out this resource?

05:23.920 --> 05:29.520
I don't want to be accused of false advertising in saying that it is very much similar.

05:29.520 --> 05:36.000
The guy phone Stephen is very similar to the guy phone. These are obviously failed guy phones.

05:36.000 --> 05:42.560
These came out of the printing press a little sloppy.

05:42.560 --> 05:46.480
So these are guy phones into which we were unable to breathe life.

05:48.240 --> 05:52.800
Yes, they are. They are these half formed golems.

05:55.760 --> 06:02.480
They are lots of variation in the models. Some of them are very big, which people

06:02.480 --> 06:08.080
aren't crazy about, just having these really big mutated corpses.

06:08.080 --> 06:13.040
But $14.99 price it can't be beat coming out this November 32nd.

06:13.840 --> 06:14.640
Get it. Get it.

06:14.640 --> 06:15.360
Guy phone Stephen.

06:15.360 --> 06:18.000
That's all for today, and now everybody Coolio.

06:19.600 --> 06:23.440
I'm Coolio, and I'm here to say I like guy phone Stephen in a major way.

06:25.600 --> 06:26.560
That's Coolio.

06:26.560 --> 06:28.320
He has not missed a step.

06:28.320 --> 06:33.120
He is still, and then he's going to drop in a fantastic voyage and lots of tiny Stevens

06:33.120 --> 06:36.480
are going to just flop on the stage from the ceiling.

06:36.480 --> 06:38.720
Be dropped like so much dead confetti.

06:38.720 --> 06:42.640
Guys, how old do I have to be to call people in college kids?

06:42.640 --> 06:47.440
I'm 25, and I really want to do that. That's from Caleb in New Zealand.

06:47.440 --> 06:51.280
God, don't call anyone below 13 a kid.

06:53.040 --> 06:55.200
I'm getting to that age where everyone's a kid to me now.

06:55.200 --> 06:57.760
Yeah, but you don't hold on, but there's a difference.

06:57.760 --> 07:01.360
Are you like, are you specifically referring to someone like, look at that kid?

07:01.360 --> 07:04.720
Are you saying like kids today or those college kids?

07:04.720 --> 07:07.040
Cause I think that's a lot less. That's innocuous.

07:07.040 --> 07:10.720
You know, say like college kids these days are like, well, I don't want to go hang out

07:10.720 --> 07:15.200
with college kids at some college bar, but I think if you like point at a 22 year old

07:15.200 --> 07:16.960
and you're like, look at this kid over here.

07:16.960 --> 07:22.240
Like everyone is a kid because every, the distinction for me is do they have

07:22.240 --> 07:27.200
responsibilities? And if you're in college, you don't.

07:27.200 --> 07:29.680
I mean, you probably don't. You might have some.

07:29.680 --> 07:34.160
They may seem like responsibilities that you have, but you don't.

07:34.160 --> 07:35.520
That's not accurate.

07:35.520 --> 07:38.880
Are they sexually active? Middle schoolers.

07:38.880 --> 07:43.440
By the time you reach middle school, this is, I saw Pew research study about this.

07:43.440 --> 07:49.280
By the time that anyone ever reaches middle school, they're already hooking up.

07:49.280 --> 07:53.440
They're already, you know, shagging and snogging.

07:55.680 --> 08:01.120
You can't look at a middle schooler that, you know, this Saturday night is going to

08:01.120 --> 08:05.600
make sweet love to a woman or to a man and say, look at that kid.

08:05.600 --> 08:08.480
Look at that sexually active kid. It's not right.

08:09.520 --> 08:10.800
But he also doesn't have a job.

08:11.520 --> 08:12.720
That doesn't matter.

08:12.720 --> 08:13.920
It does to me.

08:13.920 --> 08:15.280
Lots of adults don't have jobs.

08:15.280 --> 08:17.600
And their kids.

08:17.600 --> 08:20.080
You're saying that unemployed to a kid?

08:20.080 --> 08:20.580
Yeah.

08:21.280 --> 08:22.400
Oh, you got fired?

08:22.400 --> 08:23.520
You're a kid again.

08:23.520 --> 08:24.240
You're a kid now.

08:25.200 --> 08:29.520
Listen, if it was that way, I would tender my resignation right now.

08:30.480 --> 08:34.480
But if you have if you have no job, but you have a child, you become a young adult.

08:35.440 --> 08:36.320
OK, I don't understand.

08:36.320 --> 08:37.520
It's a weird sliding scale.

08:37.520 --> 08:38.800
I have it written down somewhere.

08:40.240 --> 08:42.960
Is there any gradient between the two or is it just hard stop?

08:42.960 --> 08:43.680
You're a kid now.

08:43.680 --> 08:48.400
Yeah. You mean if you become like a part time employee, then you're a teenager.

08:49.600 --> 08:52.640
Griffith, Travis, you realize these are tied to ages, right?

08:52.640 --> 08:55.520
I mean, you're you're we're having a lot of fun here so far.

08:56.880 --> 09:00.960
You realize these are our delineations for ages.

09:00.960 --> 09:01.460
Yeah.

09:05.040 --> 09:06.000
I did not.

09:06.000 --> 09:06.500
OK.

09:08.160 --> 09:09.360
But I'm also not ashamed.

09:09.360 --> 09:12.000
Well, I guess that's I guess that's something.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.680
Travis is a West Virginia heart.

09:13.680 --> 09:15.040
He's living mountain proud.

09:15.040 --> 09:17.040
He doesn't care about the role society makes for him.

09:17.040 --> 09:17.840
He's a mountain proud.

09:18.720 --> 09:20.720
Can we change the name of our podcast to Mountain Proud?

09:22.160 --> 09:23.200
Don't call anyone a kid.

09:23.200 --> 09:31.760
I think I think God, once you're like an irascible 70 year old who like only sits on their porch

09:31.760 --> 09:36.080
exclusively, then you can start busting out that kind of vernacular.

09:36.080 --> 09:39.680
You're 20 fucking five. No way.

09:39.680 --> 09:42.560
Because realistically, like and I get it because I do the same thing.

09:42.560 --> 09:47.840
But the reason that you want to do that is to feel superior is so that you can be like,

09:47.840 --> 09:50.400
I've seen some shit and they are still kids.

09:50.400 --> 09:51.360
And like, yeah, I get it.

09:51.360 --> 09:55.600
But it's always going to kind of even people around you that want to do the same thing.

09:55.600 --> 09:58.880
It's always going to make you seem a little bit judgy.

09:58.880 --> 10:03.920
See, it's our fucking it's our stupid fucking language devoid of any and all honorifics.

10:03.920 --> 10:07.040
That is what that is what Japanese has got on us.

10:07.600 --> 10:14.240
Like they have a system, a regimented system in place for referring to people based on

10:14.240 --> 10:18.880
their place compared to yours in like the social cast.

10:20.400 --> 10:25.760
We don't have anything like that, because if so, like, you know, I would probably call you guys,

10:26.560 --> 10:28.880
you know, misters Travis and Justin.

10:30.880 --> 10:33.760
And you would call me like Lil Griffin or something like that.

10:33.760 --> 10:35.680
Can we please get that started?

10:35.680 --> 10:37.040
I think we probably could.

10:37.040 --> 10:40.000
I have news for you, Caleb, why you should be careful.

10:40.000 --> 10:40.800
I'm 32.

10:40.800 --> 10:41.680
You're 25.

10:41.680 --> 10:42.240
Guess what?

10:42.960 --> 10:44.240
You're a kid to me.

10:44.240 --> 10:45.360
You're 25 years old.

10:45.360 --> 10:45.840
You're a kid.

10:45.840 --> 10:47.360
You're a baby boy.

10:47.360 --> 10:48.560
You're a sweet baby boy.

10:48.560 --> 10:52.240
Travis is going to be 30 years old in November.

10:52.240 --> 10:53.280
Oh, Jesus.

10:53.280 --> 10:53.680
I know.

10:53.680 --> 10:54.320
Can you imagine?

10:55.040 --> 10:56.400
What do you think you're going to be to him?

10:56.400 --> 10:57.600
I have a hint for you.

10:57.600 --> 10:58.000
A kid.

10:58.800 --> 11:01.360
This fucking podcast is not unless you be kidded.

11:01.360 --> 11:01.920
Think about it.

11:01.920 --> 11:05.360
This podcast is going to be like two and a half fucking men when Travis turns 30.

11:06.320 --> 11:10.160
It's two adults and a young upstart, crazy religious son.

11:10.720 --> 11:12.880
And introducing Lil Griffin.

11:13.680 --> 11:15.760
He melted the heart of a nation.

11:15.760 --> 11:18.000
I eat it all the potato chips.

11:19.120 --> 11:21.200
I've never watched a single episode of that show.

11:22.320 --> 11:23.600
Where's the potato chips?

11:23.600 --> 11:24.640
I have a date.

11:24.640 --> 11:25.760
I eat it all.

11:26.960 --> 11:28.240
Have you seen my slingshot?

11:28.240 --> 11:30.320
What?

11:30.320 --> 11:37.120
I actually just found my I eat it all the potato chips t-shirt from when Lil Griffin

11:37.120 --> 11:39.360
was still really big on TGIF.

11:40.960 --> 11:42.160
It is a collector's item now.

11:42.160 --> 11:43.840
So I'm going to try to hold on to it.

11:43.840 --> 11:44.560
It's going to come back.

11:44.560 --> 11:45.680
You know, they're getting the reunion.

11:46.560 --> 11:47.360
They're doing it.

11:47.360 --> 11:48.160
You guys want to Yahoo?

11:48.800 --> 11:49.120
Yeah.

11:49.120 --> 12:00.240
Um, this Yahoo was, uh, this Yahoo was sent in by Julie Ken.

12:00.240 --> 12:00.880
Thanks, Julie Ken.

12:00.880 --> 12:08.160
It's by Yahoo Answers user Koolaidman who asks how to make my clothes smell clean.

12:09.760 --> 12:12.880
I have gym tomorrow and I don't have time to wash them.

12:12.880 --> 12:17.120
How would I make them smell clean or just smell good with spraying them with tag work?

12:17.120 --> 12:18.240
Sorry, what's tag?

12:18.800 --> 12:19.360
One more time.

12:19.840 --> 12:20.960
Is that like the body spray?

12:20.960 --> 12:22.000
Is that a body spray?

12:22.000 --> 12:23.600
So there's three body sprays, right?

12:23.600 --> 12:33.040
There's the, there's the Trinity of douche smells and there's ax, there's tag, um, which

12:33.040 --> 12:36.640
is very much, it's, I believe it is also delivered in aerosol form.

12:36.640 --> 12:40.320
And then there's bod, uh, which I don't know if you guys remember bod.

12:40.320 --> 12:44.640
It was, it was a fully blown liquid form that came in a little Windex bottle.

12:44.640 --> 12:45.120
Uh huh.

12:45.120 --> 12:45.680
Uh huh.

12:45.680 --> 12:47.360
Uh huh.

12:47.360 --> 12:48.400
And you would spray that.

12:48.400 --> 12:48.800
Oh yeah.

12:48.800 --> 12:50.320
I want your bod.

12:50.320 --> 12:51.120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:51.120 --> 12:55.120
A very successful eye campaign, very successful, uh, uh, perfume.

12:56.080 --> 13:00.960
Um, and you, yeah, you just spray that on your clothes or on your wiener and then you're

13:00.960 --> 13:02.480
ready to go for the Eve.

13:02.480 --> 13:04.880
What about Saber with four R's at the end?

13:05.440 --> 13:09.360
Was that, am I misremembering that as a, as a pretty, a pretty popular one?

13:09.360 --> 13:11.840
I think you're misremembering that as like an extant thing.

13:12.400 --> 13:13.360
Saber.

13:13.360 --> 13:21.280
Remember it was like, it was like Alpine Stink and Mountain Wafter and.

13:21.280 --> 13:21.520
Yeah.

13:22.720 --> 13:24.080
Truck, truck bed gravel.

13:25.360 --> 13:26.160
Cloud shaker.

13:26.720 --> 13:28.400
Midtime Saturdays.

13:28.400 --> 13:28.960
Yeah.

13:28.960 --> 13:30.160
Bad time Saturdays.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
Fucking casual cretins.

13:34.880 --> 13:36.480
Uncle Dylan secret.

13:36.480 --> 13:38.000
They had lots of different.

13:38.000 --> 13:38.720
Uncented.

13:38.720 --> 13:46.160
You just, you just mist yourself with a, a saline.

13:46.160 --> 13:46.800
I'm dry.

13:46.800 --> 13:47.920
Sort of saline solution.

13:47.920 --> 13:48.880
I'm really dry.

13:50.880 --> 13:52.880
Um, take that with you to the theme park.

13:53.600 --> 13:54.000
Sure.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.040
Treat yourself.

13:55.040 --> 13:57.600
Treat yourself to a little spritz, spritz, little spray.

13:57.600 --> 14:05.120
How do you make clothes smell, um, in Ghostbusters, he says that if you leave a shirt in the sun

14:05.120 --> 14:07.040
for an hour, it'll smell good.

14:07.040 --> 14:09.280
Is that, is that a possibility?

14:09.280 --> 14:12.800
I thought it was that he left it outside his window so that the wind would blow through

14:12.800 --> 14:14.720
it and take all the stink particles away.

14:15.440 --> 14:17.760
I'm not sure on the physics of stink.

14:17.760 --> 14:19.920
No little, little bugs are attracted to it.

14:19.920 --> 14:21.920
They'll come harvest your stink.

14:21.920 --> 14:26.560
Take it back to their, um, um, you know, the drones will take your stink particles back

14:26.560 --> 14:27.360
to the queen.

14:27.360 --> 14:28.320
Build a stink nest.

14:29.600 --> 14:31.040
It's just like the circle of life, I guess.

14:31.040 --> 14:31.600
Beautiful.

14:32.160 --> 14:32.400
Yeah.

14:32.400 --> 14:35.440
I'm so glad that my stink is being put to a good purpose.

14:35.440 --> 14:37.120
Would you rather just waste it?

14:37.120 --> 14:40.160
Would you rather just like flush it down the washing machine, Justin?

14:41.520 --> 14:42.240
No, you're right.

14:42.240 --> 14:43.760
I'm, I'm eco.

14:43.760 --> 14:44.720
I'm green.

14:44.720 --> 14:50.800
I use shopping bags at the shopper and, uh, I, I, uh, I'm into this.

14:50.800 --> 14:51.920
I'm into stink harvesting.

14:51.920 --> 14:56.720
I actually wash my clothes in the river, uh, with sharp, uh, jagged stones.

14:56.720 --> 15:02.720
Um, so that way all the stink forms into a reef, um, that can host marine life.

15:02.720 --> 15:03.280
Yeah.

15:03.280 --> 15:05.600
You always have to fucking one-up me.

15:05.600 --> 15:07.520
Well, I'm just saying, like, I'm trying to live a green life.

15:07.520 --> 15:08.000
I'm sick of it.

15:08.000 --> 15:08.560
I'm sick of it.

15:08.560 --> 15:09.360
I don't take baths anymore.

15:09.360 --> 15:09.920
I'm sick of it.

15:09.920 --> 15:10.960
I feed my clothes.

15:10.960 --> 15:11.840
Do I use deodorant?

15:11.840 --> 15:17.840
I feed my clothes to my kids and that's like a fun way of like reducing my footprint.

15:17.840 --> 15:24.480
Um, because my kids die and then they don't, they don't like do anything and they don't

15:24.480 --> 15:25.760
like consume anything anymore.

15:25.760 --> 15:31.840
I, I actually send, uh, all my unwanted, uh, stinky clothes, uh, to, uh, starving children

15:31.840 --> 15:33.360
in Africa.

15:33.360 --> 15:38.880
Uh, so they can wear like my print at Hardy T's, um, some of my, like my Ginko jeans.

15:38.880 --> 15:39.840
Oh, they love that shit.

15:39.840 --> 15:40.320
They love it.

15:40.320 --> 15:40.800
They love the bag.

15:40.800 --> 15:45.200
Oh, that is a great, please tell me that you wore your Ed Hardy T and your Ginko jeans

15:45.200 --> 15:49.920
together while you sprayed yourself with unscented bod and just like got ready to get

15:49.920 --> 15:50.400
fucked.

15:50.400 --> 15:53.600
When they see me, I want them to be like, ah, that dude is classy.

15:53.600 --> 15:56.480
And I know that because his t-shirt says classy.

15:56.480 --> 15:57.840
Travis isn't just a look.

15:57.840 --> 15:59.840
Travis isn't just a person.

15:59.840 --> 16:01.520
Travis is an aesthetic.

16:01.520 --> 16:01.840
Really?

16:01.840 --> 16:02.080
Yeah.

16:02.880 --> 16:03.360
You know what?

16:03.360 --> 16:06.320
What I'm doing is I'm, I'm selling my brand.

16:06.320 --> 16:06.960
You know what I mean?

16:06.960 --> 16:08.320
Like it's not just me.

16:08.320 --> 16:09.840
It's Travis trademark.

16:11.360 --> 16:12.880
Travis's saggums.

16:12.880 --> 16:18.080
And cause you're, um, I'm assuming your Ginko jeans were tent like.

16:19.840 --> 16:21.600
They actually contain smaller pants.

16:23.280 --> 16:24.720
So I don't understand.

16:24.720 --> 16:26.000
Are we talking about four pant legs?

16:26.000 --> 16:27.360
You're only occupying two at a time.

16:27.360 --> 16:29.120
Please don't say three like a dick joke.

16:29.120 --> 16:31.920
No, no, I have two dicks.

16:31.920 --> 16:32.160
Okay.

16:33.440 --> 16:34.880
Uh, moving on.

16:34.880 --> 16:39.360
I was raised super religious and was prohibited from most physical contact with other people.

16:39.360 --> 16:42.480
If I had been caught even holding hands with a girl, I would have been expelled.

16:43.440 --> 16:47.040
I've since gotten out of that environment, but now I don't know what the rules are in

16:47.040 --> 16:48.160
the real world.

16:48.160 --> 16:52.320
So far I've been avoiding touching people except for handshakes and goodbye hugs, but

16:52.320 --> 16:57.600
touching is really important for flirting and it would be fun if I could be sure I wasn't

16:57.600 --> 17:00.560
committing some unforgivable social sin by doing it to be clear.

17:00.560 --> 17:02.480
I'm not talking about kissing or sex.

17:02.480 --> 17:04.000
Those have obvious rules.

17:04.000 --> 17:07.120
I'm talking about the zone between greeting strangers and kissing.

17:07.760 --> 17:11.680
When can I touch people without being a creepy jerk?

17:11.680 --> 17:14.000
That's from touchless in Rhode Island.

17:15.440 --> 17:16.880
Such a good question.

17:16.880 --> 17:17.200
Yeah.

17:17.200 --> 17:22.240
Except that like the zone between greeting strangers and kissing is like all of it.

17:22.960 --> 17:25.280
It's like, it's like everything.

17:25.280 --> 17:27.600
Everything's hard and dangerous.

17:27.600 --> 17:28.880
It's the whole spectrum.

17:28.880 --> 17:31.520
You're talking about like a billion different steps in between those two.

17:31.520 --> 17:33.200
Do you want to hear the creepy actor answer?

17:33.920 --> 17:35.440
I don't think I do.

17:35.440 --> 17:37.440
I think you have a feeling you're going to say it out loud anyway.

17:37.440 --> 17:38.240
I am.

17:38.240 --> 17:43.280
One of the things that we learned in our acting movement kind of classes is that when you're

17:43.280 --> 17:46.880
working with someone, you can feel their energy.

17:46.880 --> 17:47.760
Fuck off.

17:47.760 --> 17:53.360
Open holes where like people could like let you know where it's okay to touch them during

17:53.360 --> 17:56.960
a scene based on where their energy opened up a vacuum.

17:58.640 --> 18:05.840
For a long time, Travis would walk into a party and say, does everyone feel my dick energy?

18:06.480 --> 18:08.400
I feel some really prominent energy.

18:08.400 --> 18:09.520
If anyone wants to...

18:11.200 --> 18:14.000
I actually, to be fair, called it pinergy, but go on.

18:14.000 --> 18:21.200
I have created a hole in my chi and in my jinko jeans for you to experience my dick beams.

18:21.200 --> 18:22.320
Bzzz.

18:22.320 --> 18:22.880
Let me help.

18:22.880 --> 18:23.760
Bzzz.

18:23.760 --> 18:24.240
Gotcha.

18:24.240 --> 18:24.960
We can set some-

18:24.960 --> 18:25.840
Should I go?

18:25.840 --> 18:29.520
We can set some pretty easy rules, okay?

18:29.520 --> 18:30.240
Here's one.

18:30.880 --> 18:32.960
Don't touch anyone's butt.

18:33.680 --> 18:34.080
Yep.

18:34.080 --> 18:37.120
Don't touch anyone's butt ever.

18:37.120 --> 18:38.160
I think if it's...

18:39.680 --> 18:43.280
If it is shielded by a bathing suit, of course not.

18:45.040 --> 18:46.480
If it's shielded by...

18:46.480 --> 18:47.440
I don't care if it's shielded by-

18:47.440 --> 18:52.240
What appropriate amount of fabric is there that it is okay to socially touch someone's butt?

18:54.320 --> 18:54.720
God.

18:56.000 --> 18:56.640
You don't.

18:56.640 --> 18:57.840
I'm sorry, you don't.

18:57.840 --> 18:59.200
Don't ever touch anyone's butt.

18:59.200 --> 19:00.800
Man, woman, child, child.

19:00.800 --> 19:03.120
I don't care if you're wearing six ski suits.

19:04.080 --> 19:07.040
Yeah, I don't even care if you can't tell where their butt is.

19:07.600 --> 19:12.080
Like you give them a butt sort of DMZ, right?

19:12.720 --> 19:13.760
Do not touch that butt.

19:13.760 --> 19:15.040
Do not touch any butts.

19:15.040 --> 19:18.480
If you're in a committed relationship, then you get an engagement ring

19:18.480 --> 19:20.880
and then you ask if you can touch the butt.

19:20.880 --> 19:22.000
Other than that, no butt touching.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.920
Are we talking about in public or in private?

19:23.920 --> 19:26.800
I'm talking about if you're not in a relationship with someone,

19:27.440 --> 19:29.040
you should never touch their butt.

19:29.600 --> 19:29.920
Yes.

19:29.920 --> 19:31.280
Why are you even like-

19:31.840 --> 19:33.600
This person doesn't know!

19:33.600 --> 19:34.560
I'm helping.

19:34.560 --> 19:35.440
This is helpful.

19:36.320 --> 19:39.600
I don't think it's helpful as much as it is like completely obvious.

19:39.600 --> 19:40.720
Let's go for more of a gray area.

19:40.720 --> 19:42.480
Don't put your finger in their butt either.

19:42.480 --> 19:43.520
Like don't-

19:43.520 --> 19:44.880
Don't come their ears.

19:44.880 --> 19:47.120
Don't go inside them in any way.

19:47.760 --> 19:48.480
In any way.

19:48.480 --> 19:50.240
I'm trying to create a practical guide.

19:50.240 --> 19:51.600
Don't enter any orifices.

19:51.600 --> 19:52.320
That's great.

19:52.320 --> 19:53.520
Don't touch their butt.

19:53.520 --> 19:56.160
Your mouth probably shouldn't touch anything.

19:56.160 --> 19:57.920
Like don't put your mouth on someone's neck.

19:57.920 --> 19:58.560
They hate it.

19:59.520 --> 20:01.760
Okay, so let's go for more of a gray area

20:01.760 --> 20:04.800
and less of like an evil like dark dark area.

20:04.800 --> 20:06.640
Sorry, if you were this guy,

20:06.640 --> 20:08.800
would you be more concerned about entering a gray area

20:08.800 --> 20:11.200
or entering the evil dark area?

20:11.200 --> 20:13.680
Just like you put your tongue in my butt and I'm a stranger.

20:13.680 --> 20:15.200
Like I didn't- I didn't know.

20:15.200 --> 20:16.640
I don't know what this is.

20:16.640 --> 20:17.280
I know he's not-

20:17.280 --> 20:18.400
I'm stuck!

20:18.400 --> 20:19.280
I'm stuck!

20:20.480 --> 20:22.720
I know he's not in Cedar, man.

20:22.720 --> 20:25.120
Like I know he has some baseline.

20:25.120 --> 20:26.400
I'm just trying to get the easy stuff-

20:26.400 --> 20:27.600
Well, but like what about shoulder?

20:27.600 --> 20:28.480
What about shoulder?

20:29.120 --> 20:29.440
Okay.

20:29.440 --> 20:30.960
When is it okay to touch someone's shoulder?

20:30.960 --> 20:33.600
I think you could touch someone's shoulder for one fact-

20:33.600 --> 20:35.280
One Mississippi, done.

20:35.280 --> 20:36.000
Out.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.360
Longer than one Mississippi

20:37.360 --> 20:38.480
and I think that you've-

20:38.480 --> 20:40.160
Unless you're posing for a picture.

20:40.160 --> 20:41.600
Like I think that that's-

20:41.600 --> 20:43.920
I think also like there's a big difference between

20:43.920 --> 20:45.680
touching someone's shoulder like in greeting.

20:45.680 --> 20:46.320
Like, hey!

20:46.320 --> 20:48.160
And you kind of like smack their back,

20:48.160 --> 20:48.960
you know, kind of thing.

20:48.960 --> 20:50.480
Or like give them like a side hug.

20:50.480 --> 20:51.040
Don't hurt them.

20:51.040 --> 20:52.400
Versus like you're sitting there talking to them

20:52.400 --> 20:53.760
and suddenly you just reach out

20:53.760 --> 20:55.200
and rest your hand on their shoulder.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.720
That- that should be saved for serious conversations.

20:58.720 --> 20:58.960
Yes.

21:00.960 --> 21:02.560
I think that what if-

21:02.560 --> 21:03.360
What if we had-

21:03.360 --> 21:06.080
What if we invented some kind of social sex dice?

21:07.040 --> 21:08.960
And then whenever you greeted a stranger,

21:08.960 --> 21:10.160
you would each roll a dice

21:10.160 --> 21:12.880
and it would tell you a body part to touch with their body part.

21:12.880 --> 21:14.400
But it wouldn't be anything perverse.

21:14.400 --> 21:16.480
It would just be like hand to like cheek.

21:16.480 --> 21:18.400
Oh, so it's just like completely innocuous

21:18.400 --> 21:19.840
like elbow to elbow.

21:19.840 --> 21:21.920
Yep, to knock your knees together.

21:21.920 --> 21:24.320
And then you would just like do a-

21:24.320 --> 21:25.520
Oh, you know what would be good?

21:25.520 --> 21:28.960
What if there was some sort of codified way of greeting somebody

21:28.960 --> 21:30.640
where you just like grabbed their hand

21:30.640 --> 21:31.600
and then grabbed your hand?

21:31.600 --> 21:33.440
Like what are we fucking talking about?

21:33.440 --> 21:35.440
He already covered handshakes.

21:36.080 --> 21:38.080
That- that part he's good with.

21:38.080 --> 21:41.360
He's trying to close the bridge between handshakes and kissing

21:41.360 --> 21:44.000
and I'm trying to shine the light of truth

21:44.000 --> 21:46.640
on some of the pitfalls that he's got to avoid.

21:46.640 --> 21:46.960
All right.

21:46.960 --> 21:47.600
Flirty fun.

21:47.600 --> 21:48.480
Flirty fun.

21:48.480 --> 21:49.120
That's our new-

21:49.120 --> 21:50.000
That's the new motto.

21:50.000 --> 21:50.640
Flirty fun.

21:51.440 --> 21:52.080
Keep it fun.

21:52.080 --> 21:52.880
Keep it flirty.

21:52.880 --> 21:53.840
Keep it not weird.

21:55.200 --> 21:56.240
That's like nothing.

21:57.040 --> 21:58.480
There's nothing you can do.

21:58.480 --> 21:59.680
This is the great-

21:59.680 --> 22:00.000
There's-

22:00.000 --> 22:02.960
It's a mystery how anyone gets born.

22:02.960 --> 22:04.000
No, you know what you do?

22:04.000 --> 22:04.480
You gotta-

22:04.480 --> 22:07.920
You gotta take the- the shit that you already know.

22:07.920 --> 22:12.640
You gotta take your- your areas in which you are confident and competent

22:12.640 --> 22:13.920
and you need to put a little-

22:13.920 --> 22:15.280
You gotta chop it and screw it.

22:15.280 --> 22:16.480
You gotta remix it a little bit.

22:16.480 --> 22:19.360
So like go in for that hug when you say goodbye to somebody you like.

22:19.360 --> 22:22.800
Maybe hold it in for like second and a half too long

22:22.800 --> 22:25.040
or like really get your chin down in that neck.

22:25.600 --> 22:28.320
People are gonna either like that or not like that and then you know.

22:29.200 --> 22:30.160
Or maybe when your hand-

22:30.160 --> 22:31.920
Maybe when you're shaking their hand,

22:31.920 --> 22:33.840
you hold it for like a long time

22:33.840 --> 22:35.360
and then you take your other hand on the-

22:35.360 --> 22:38.000
You take your index finger and you make little circles

22:38.000 --> 22:39.520
on the back of their hand while you're holding it.

22:40.400 --> 22:42.480
It's just like fun flirty stuff you can do.

22:42.480 --> 22:44.800
Griffin's suggesting a very-

22:45.360 --> 22:48.800
A very Dian Fossey sort of gorillas in the mist approach

22:48.800 --> 22:52.720
to learning social interaction where just you physically do it

22:52.720 --> 22:54.320
and see if you get bitten.

22:54.320 --> 22:55.440
And then take notes.

22:55.440 --> 22:58.880
And then move to a different town once you've established your thing.

22:58.880 --> 23:00.000
That's another important thing.

23:00.000 --> 23:03.040
After every physical interaction,

23:03.040 --> 23:05.280
copious notes in front of the person.

23:05.280 --> 23:07.120
They need to see you're engaged.

23:07.120 --> 23:11.280
And if you could do it like on a live blog kind of setup

23:11.280 --> 23:14.400
so that other people can learn from your experiences.

23:14.400 --> 23:16.960
Oh definitely, definitely want to know what happens here.

23:16.960 --> 23:18.880
Definitely want some follow-up info.

23:18.880 --> 23:20.240
And maybe some GIFs.

23:20.240 --> 23:21.920
Maybe a couple GIF GIFs.

23:21.920 --> 23:25.120
Maybe the answer here is just to never be

23:25.760 --> 23:28.400
sort of the hugresser if you will.

23:28.400 --> 23:32.560
And make it clear the sort of social physical contact

23:32.560 --> 23:34.320
that you're in the market for.

23:34.320 --> 23:39.680
Sort of put your sign out and let that person take the lead.

23:39.680 --> 23:41.600
I mean because here's the thing realistically,

23:41.600 --> 23:43.520
like as I've been sitting here trying to think about it,

23:43.520 --> 23:46.400
it's one of those things that as soon as you are thinking about it,

23:46.400 --> 23:49.280
there is nothing you can do that's not creepy.

23:49.280 --> 23:49.840
You know what I mean?

23:49.840 --> 23:51.760
Because the thing is,

23:51.760 --> 23:55.520
as soon as it's not like just a spontaneous action that you've taken,

23:55.520 --> 23:56.480
when you think about it like,

23:56.480 --> 23:58.320
can I touch their shoulder right now?

23:58.320 --> 23:59.440
It's already creepy.

23:59.440 --> 24:00.800
You're inherently thinking about something

24:00.800 --> 24:02.880
that you would be ashamed to say out loud.

24:02.880 --> 24:04.720
Like you would never say out loud to someone,

24:04.720 --> 24:06.720
I've been thinking about how to touch you.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.720
Because that dog will not hunt.

24:10.720 --> 24:12.640
So I would say like the best thing to do

24:12.640 --> 24:14.640
is just try to quiet your mind

24:14.640 --> 24:17.680
and just like hang out with the person and not worry about it.

24:18.400 --> 24:22.080
And then if you know in the course of the conversation,

24:22.080 --> 24:24.640
like you end up like kind of you know touching their arm or whatever,

24:24.640 --> 24:25.360
so be it.

24:25.360 --> 24:28.880
But if you try to think about it while you're doing it,

24:28.880 --> 24:31.840
one, you're probably not paying attention to them

24:31.840 --> 24:34.320
and not really listening and being a good friend

24:34.320 --> 24:36.080
or flirting efficiently.

24:36.080 --> 24:38.240
And secondly, as you're thinking about it,

24:39.200 --> 24:42.240
you're ruining the moment by forcing it.

24:42.240 --> 24:43.680
Yeah, but if you don't think,

24:43.680 --> 24:46.720
I mean, yes, but if you just go out,

24:46.720 --> 24:48.960
that's what being drunk is for,

24:48.960 --> 24:50.880
to do these sorts of things without consideration.

24:50.880 --> 24:52.080
Oh, was that not clear?

24:52.080 --> 24:54.080
You need to be drunk 24 stuff.

24:54.080 --> 24:57.440
Yeah, there's nothing that people like around more than a touchy drunk guy.

24:57.440 --> 25:01.280
That's never gotten anyone into trouble.

25:01.280 --> 25:03.920
Everybody else also has to be as drunk if not more.

25:04.480 --> 25:05.440
Did we all touch?

25:05.440 --> 25:09.040
I was just gonna make a joke about how you can sing ZZ Top's

25:09.040 --> 25:11.120
I'm just looking for some touch to people,

25:11.120 --> 25:13.040
but the name of that song is actually tush.

25:14.320 --> 25:16.800
Like they're singing like I'm just looking for some tush.

25:16.800 --> 25:20.560
How the fuck have we allowed ZZ Top to get away with that shit

25:20.560 --> 25:21.920
since the summer of 75?

25:22.720 --> 25:23.920
What the like, what the fuck have we-

25:23.920 --> 25:26.080
They have a song called like tube snake boogie.

25:26.080 --> 25:27.040
Right.

25:27.040 --> 25:28.240
How about wieners?

25:28.240 --> 25:30.320
That song called she wants a pearl necklace.

25:30.320 --> 25:31.040
But that's fun.

25:31.040 --> 25:33.840
But that's like fun, like a fun double entendre.

25:33.840 --> 25:35.440
They're literally saying like,

25:35.440 --> 25:38.240
I'm just trying to hunt some fanny cheeks.

25:38.240 --> 25:43.360
Like ZZ Top, I just wanna squeeze a titty.

25:43.360 --> 25:47.040
Like ZZ Top, you can't just come out and say the thing that you wanna do.

25:47.600 --> 25:54.880
I would like to ejaculate thanks to a sexual partner's interaction with my genitals.

25:54.880 --> 25:57.520
ZZ Top.

25:57.520 --> 25:58.640
Mr. Top, please stop.

25:59.280 --> 26:02.160
The joke, the persistent joke of ZZ Top

26:02.160 --> 26:04.320
is that anyone could ever love a bearded man.

26:04.880 --> 26:11.360
This is the great underlying satirical tone in their music,

26:11.360 --> 26:14.640
which you miss if you aren't paying close enough attention.

26:14.640 --> 26:15.040
Also-

26:15.040 --> 26:16.800
The word, according to the Wikipedia article,

26:16.800 --> 26:19.760
the word tush is pronounced in the song in such a way

26:19.760 --> 26:21.200
that it rhymes with the word rush,

26:21.200 --> 26:25.040
resulting in a mond green, which has some listeners believing the word is touch

26:25.040 --> 26:26.080
if they haven't read the lyrics.

26:26.080 --> 26:28.320
That's because they fucking like said the word wrong.

26:28.320 --> 26:29.680
You're not allowed to do that either.

26:31.680 --> 26:33.920
You're not allowed to do that either.

26:35.120 --> 26:37.520
Say what you will, I love Munduck Dynasty.

26:37.520 --> 26:39.840
Some episodes of that show are really tushing.

26:39.840 --> 26:40.880
What are you fucking doing?

26:40.880 --> 26:41.380
Yeah.

26:42.880 --> 26:44.320
Here's a Yahoo answer.

26:44.320 --> 26:46.000
Here's a Yahoo mystery, Knights.

26:46.000 --> 26:49.840
Yahoo mystery, Knights.

26:49.840 --> 26:51.840
It was sent to me by Jacob Holt.

26:51.840 --> 26:52.400
Thanks, Jacob.

26:52.400 --> 26:55.680
It's by Yahoo mystery user Mondo10, who asks,

26:57.520 --> 27:01.920
would it look cocky or vulgar if I posted a transformation pic on Facebook?

27:03.600 --> 27:06.400
Like, I was about to upload my before and after pic

27:06.400 --> 27:10.960
of how I was fat starting sophomore and how I look now with a six pack

27:10.960 --> 27:12.160
and completely shredded.

27:12.720 --> 27:14.480
When people hate or think I'm cocky,

27:14.480 --> 27:16.560
it's not like I'm doing a selfie of my body.

27:16.560 --> 27:18.240
It's putting both in one pic.

27:18.960 --> 27:20.160
You're doing a double selfie.

27:21.120 --> 27:25.360
Right, but if he was totally ripped and shredded in both pics,

27:25.360 --> 27:26.480
then I think it would be a selfie.

27:26.480 --> 27:29.520
I think this is like an admission of-

27:30.160 --> 27:31.280
Let me throw this out.

27:31.280 --> 27:34.880
This is the only circumstance in which I would allow this.

27:34.880 --> 27:38.080
Picture one, ripped, shredded, lifting up,

27:38.080 --> 27:40.960
your wife beat her to show your abs, posing.

27:40.960 --> 27:44.720
Picture two, exact same picture, but you took it a month later

27:44.720 --> 27:45.840
after you're growing a mustache.

27:46.400 --> 27:48.560
And you have a seventh, you have a seventh pack.

27:49.520 --> 27:51.360
And it's like one of those like magic eye,

27:51.360 --> 27:54.240
like find the differences and the difference is the mustache

27:54.240 --> 27:57.440
and the seventh app that's migrated up towards your right breast.

27:57.440 --> 27:59.280
Right, and if you look really, really,

27:59.280 --> 28:01.440
if you put your face really close into those abs

28:01.440 --> 28:04.160
and you pull back just a little bit, oh, it's a sailboat.

28:06.000 --> 28:07.760
There's a sailboat in there.

28:07.760 --> 28:08.320
That's fun.

28:08.320 --> 28:14.880
I think that you should have one picture of yourself completely fat,

28:15.440 --> 28:16.240
totally fat.

28:16.240 --> 28:17.680
You probably have one of those.

28:17.680 --> 28:20.800
And then the second picture, you're shredded, right?

28:20.800 --> 28:24.960
Six pack the whole bit, except you're surrounded by Nazi paraphernalia.

28:28.720 --> 28:32.000
People are forced to confront the nature of transformation

28:32.000 --> 28:34.640
and the steep price we must sometimes pay.

28:34.640 --> 28:36.880
You take the good, you take the bad, you take them both.

28:36.880 --> 28:41.120
And this is a third panel that just says worth it, question mark.

28:41.120 --> 28:42.640
Maybe, it's up to you, listener.

28:43.280 --> 28:46.560
I miss fat, non-antisemitic Joe.

28:46.560 --> 28:47.920
Okay, what about first picture?

28:47.920 --> 28:49.840
You're fat, but you're very happy.

28:49.840 --> 28:51.120
Second picture, you're ripped,

28:51.120 --> 28:53.520
but they can see that there's trouble behind your eyes.

28:53.520 --> 28:56.880
Then a third panel where you're fat again and clearly happy again.

28:56.880 --> 28:57.200
Okay.

28:57.840 --> 28:59.520
You've just come back around, but you know what?

28:59.520 --> 29:00.400
I wasn't happy.

29:00.400 --> 29:02.240
I wasn't, it's like limitless.

29:02.880 --> 29:04.320
No, it's like fucking shallow hell.

29:04.320 --> 29:05.600
If you're going to compare it to a film.

29:05.600 --> 29:06.800
It's like shallow limitless.

29:07.840 --> 29:11.680
I think the fat to like shred it up to like,

29:11.680 --> 29:14.320
then a third panel where you're just kind of somewhere in the middle.

29:14.320 --> 29:16.480
And that's sort of a realistic take on weight loss.

29:16.480 --> 29:18.080
It's like, oh man, I fucking slipped up.

29:18.080 --> 29:20.160
I need to eat and healthy sucked.

29:20.160 --> 29:23.440
So I might as well just try and like balance out until I die.

29:24.160 --> 29:25.600
You know, but they don't do that with other things.

29:25.600 --> 29:28.400
There's not like one where the dudes are just sitting in pajama pants at home

29:28.400 --> 29:31.280
watching SpongeBob SquarePants at like three o'clock in the afternoon.

29:31.280 --> 29:33.680
And then the second panel where the guy sitting in a cubicle,

29:33.680 --> 29:35.760
like talking on the phone, giving a big thumbs up.

29:35.760 --> 29:36.800
I don't understand.

29:36.800 --> 29:39.120
Like, oh, you're talking about being unemployed and employed.

29:39.120 --> 29:42.160
Like there's not before and after for any other life situation.

29:42.160 --> 29:43.600
Between being a kid and an adult, you mean?

29:44.720 --> 29:45.600
Yes. Thank you.

29:45.600 --> 29:48.560
But like that idea of saying like, this was me fat and this is me fit.

29:48.560 --> 29:52.480
Like there's no like, this was me living in an apartment.

29:52.480 --> 29:53.600
This is me living in a house.

29:53.600 --> 29:56.000
This is me before I learned C plus programming.

29:56.000 --> 29:56.400
Yeah.

29:56.400 --> 29:57.520
And this is me after I learned it.

29:57.520 --> 29:58.080
Can you tell?

29:58.880 --> 29:59.380
Right.

29:59.840 --> 30:01.200
I programmed this Facebook.

30:01.200 --> 30:01.760
I don't understand.

30:01.760 --> 30:02.880
I don't understand the obsession.

30:03.840 --> 30:05.600
I used to not be able to cook quinoa.

30:05.600 --> 30:06.480
Now I totally do.

30:06.480 --> 30:07.520
And I eat it all the time.

30:07.520 --> 30:11.920
Can you tell before and after you look so much happier in the second picture?

30:11.920 --> 30:12.960
Yeah, it's the quinoa.

30:12.960 --> 30:17.760
I told you I learned it's an ancient, it's an ancient grain, super food.

30:18.480 --> 30:20.320
It's a super food and an ancient grain.

30:21.360 --> 30:22.480
This is me pre-goji.

30:22.480 --> 30:23.440
This is me after goji.

30:23.440 --> 30:28.080
You can tell because I'm fucking, I have a 13 pack and I'm fucking glowing.

30:28.080 --> 30:33.360
And I'm floating six inches off.

30:33.360 --> 30:34.800
I'm floating six inches off the ground.

30:34.800 --> 30:38.320
I'm shooting beams of energy out of my, out of my chi holes.

30:40.000 --> 30:41.360
I went super Saiyan.

30:41.360 --> 30:42.160
There, it's out.

30:42.160 --> 30:44.960
I went super Saiyan thanks to my goji and my ancient grains.

30:46.400 --> 30:49.680
If we want to buy more goji and ancient grains, we got to get some money.

30:49.680 --> 31:03.520
So let's do that now.

31:03.520 --> 31:07.600
We talk a lot about sex toys on this program week to week.

31:07.600 --> 31:07.920
We do?

31:08.720 --> 31:09.440
I know.

31:09.440 --> 31:11.200
Thanks to our friends, extremistraints.com.

31:11.200 --> 31:13.200
But I want to, I want to change it up.

31:13.200 --> 31:19.360
I feel like we give so much coverage to extremistraints.com's sex toys that we miss

31:19.360 --> 31:21.520
all the other great options.

31:22.080 --> 31:23.920
I get all my groceries off extremistraints.

31:25.520 --> 31:27.280
The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty.

31:27.280 --> 31:28.160
That's a book.

31:28.160 --> 31:29.200
You could just buy that.

31:29.760 --> 31:30.880
It's by Anne Rice.

31:31.920 --> 31:37.600
It's a very, it's a book about the creator of Sleeping Beauty who is very litigious.

31:39.120 --> 31:43.760
And there were a lot of people who wrote basically Sleeping Beauty knockoffs.

31:43.760 --> 31:47.120
And so this writer had to like defend her intellectual property.

31:47.120 --> 31:48.480
It's very fascinating stuff.

31:48.480 --> 31:49.280
Very interesting.

31:50.400 --> 31:51.520
It's probably not about that at all.

31:51.520 --> 31:58.080
There's also a book you can pick up called Bondage for Sex, which is a great, I'm glad

31:58.080 --> 32:05.440
they're differentiating from, I don't know, bondage for tax evasion.

32:05.440 --> 32:08.240
I don't know the other reasons for bondage.

32:08.800 --> 32:10.960
Pipe sealant, I'm guessing.

32:10.960 --> 32:11.440
I guess.

32:12.960 --> 32:14.720
Bondage for own protection.

32:15.360 --> 32:17.040
Bondage for your own safety.

32:17.040 --> 32:17.520
Your werewolf.

32:17.520 --> 32:18.240
For werewolves.

32:18.240 --> 32:19.280
Yeah, exactly.

32:20.160 --> 32:23.440
Or maybe like you just can't control yourself around chocolate chip cookies, you know?

32:23.440 --> 32:25.200
Like if you put me in front of them, I'm going to eat them.

32:25.200 --> 32:27.200
So I'm going to need you to strap into this bed.

32:27.200 --> 32:27.840
Hold me back.

32:28.800 --> 32:29.600
There's a paddle.

32:30.160 --> 32:32.160
That's great for strict parents.

32:32.720 --> 32:34.160
Or for getting pizzas out of the oven.

32:34.960 --> 32:38.800
That is if you want the bottom of your child or the bottom of your pizza to say

32:38.800 --> 32:40.000
slut on it backwards.

32:42.240 --> 32:46.400
Will you make, you make this amazing artichoke slut pizza?

32:46.400 --> 32:48.720
Uh, can you, can we have that for dinner tonight?

32:50.000 --> 32:51.680
Can we have slut pizza for dinner tonight?

32:52.480 --> 32:53.440
Absolutely.

32:53.440 --> 32:55.680
That's all, that's the only thing on my menu.

32:56.640 --> 32:58.400
And I mean, of course there's nipple clamps.

32:58.400 --> 33:03.120
There's so much extreme restraints.com chastity devices, which are like the opposite of sex

33:03.120 --> 33:04.000
toys.

33:04.000 --> 33:04.640
Think about it.

33:06.080 --> 33:06.720

You didn't spell.

And unsettling.

I have a message for Blaine from Mary who says in just a few days we will be married.

33:41.840 --> 33:45.680
I can't properly express how excited I am to spend the rest of my life with you.

33:45.680 --> 33:49.760
I look forward to years of cats, video games, and traveling all over the world.

33:49.760 --> 33:54.240
I love everything about you and hope that someday we can finally own a horse together.

33:54.240 --> 33:55.520
I did not misspell house.

33:57.280 --> 33:59.360
I'm sure this comes as quite the surprise to Blaine.

34:00.560 --> 34:03.520
A horse is like the best shelter I think you can have.

34:03.520 --> 34:04.560
Like a tax shelter?

34:05.200 --> 34:06.720
No, like a living place.

34:06.720 --> 34:07.200
Oh, okay.

34:08.880 --> 34:13.040
I would point out though that if you're hoping to travel the world, maybe having a pet horse

34:13.040 --> 34:16.880
isn't the way to go because you can't really like take them with you.

34:18.080 --> 34:19.680
And God knows you'll want to.

34:19.680 --> 34:20.960
Like you're not going to want to leave them.

34:20.960 --> 34:22.000
That's the problem.

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
All your plans for, you know, you can make all these plans.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.160
We're going to be different from all the other horse owners.

34:26.160 --> 34:27.760
We're going to be cool, you know.

34:28.800 --> 34:31.440
But once you have the horse, everything changes.

34:32.720 --> 34:34.320
You're going to want to stay home more.

34:34.320 --> 34:38.320
You know, maybe another night watching Project Runway reruns.

34:38.320 --> 34:43.360
Not so bad because you get to do it together as a family with your horse.

34:43.360 --> 34:47.200
I've been looking into this two-bedroom, two-bath horse here in Austin.

34:48.720 --> 34:49.680
I can get it for a song.

34:49.680 --> 34:52.080
It's really competitive, the horsey market.

34:53.040 --> 35:01.280
I got a message for Alexandra Splendor from Alexandra Splendor and she says,

35:01.280 --> 35:05.120
hey brothers, it's my 20th birthday on the 21st.

35:05.120 --> 35:09.040
I want to treat myself to a special birthday message from my favorite trio.

35:09.040 --> 35:11.680
My friend Amber introduced me to your show via Corncob Boy

35:11.680 --> 35:12.960
and I've been obsessed ever since.

35:12.960 --> 35:15.520
Your show has helped me get through life with a smile.

35:17.040 --> 35:18.480
Danny Glover, you all.

35:19.520 --> 35:21.920
P.S. Can Griffin say sugar water?

35:25.440 --> 35:28.320
Man, we had a fucking exterminator come to our house

35:28.320 --> 35:30.560
because we have a very serious ant problem.

35:30.560 --> 35:36.000
Um, and my cat, like, went ape shit on him.

35:36.000 --> 35:39.040
Like, I've never seen my cat, like, freak the fuck out before.

35:39.600 --> 35:41.200
And when I told Rachel, she was like,

35:41.200 --> 35:43.840
is it possible that he was a bunch of bugs in a suit?

35:45.840 --> 35:47.440
Like, the cockroach guy from Men in Black.

35:47.440 --> 35:52.240
If he's a bunch of bugs in a suit, being an exterminator seems a cruel twist of fate.

35:52.240 --> 35:57.120
Maybe, or else he's just, like, false flagging it and just spraying water.

35:57.120 --> 35:58.160
Or sugar water.

35:58.160 --> 36:00.720
Sugar is spraying over the water all around my house.

36:02.720 --> 36:05.840
You shouldn't have any more problems with ants.

36:07.840 --> 36:11.440
We've sprayed it with a deadly toxin.

36:11.440 --> 36:12.480
You sound like Torgo.

36:13.280 --> 36:17.520
The only way to check it is to leave apples on the counter.

36:20.160 --> 36:22.000
A dish of jelly?

36:22.000 --> 36:25.120
Well, that seems perfect.

36:25.120 --> 36:28.160
Uh, we have one more message.

36:28.160 --> 36:31.120
It's for Alicia Neal, uh, from Justin Gray.

36:31.120 --> 36:32.000
Happy birthday.

36:32.000 --> 36:34.080
Happy 30th birthday to Alicia Neal.

36:34.080 --> 36:39.680
Wonderful painter, beloved by corgis, never-ending story, and M-B-M-B-A-M devotee.

36:39.680 --> 36:44.880
An all-around swell lady from her demo partner in crime and co-liver in sin, Justin.

36:44.880 --> 36:51.120
May this year bring you the fanciest of cocktails, macaroons, adventures, and parties.

36:51.120 --> 36:53.280
I feel like I know everything about this lady now.

36:53.280 --> 36:55.360
Yeah, I have a window into her soul.

36:55.360 --> 36:57.520
I like that we're on par with never-ending story.

36:58.560 --> 36:59.680
I wouldn't say that.

36:59.680 --> 37:00.960
It's heavy praise.

37:00.960 --> 37:02.800
But she's devoted to us both.

37:02.800 --> 37:04.480
She is a servant of two masters.

37:05.120 --> 37:07.040
I don't think we could call ourselves her master.

37:07.040 --> 37:07.920
That's terrible.

37:08.560 --> 37:09.040
Now we're her master.

37:09.040 --> 37:10.160
You can't get the fold, Alicia.

37:11.440 --> 37:12.480
Please put on this robe.

37:13.360 --> 37:15.200
Uh, this robe smells terrible.

37:17.840 --> 37:19.360
Didn't you have this thing harvested?

37:20.560 --> 37:22.240
I forgot to put it outside the window.

37:22.240 --> 37:23.280
I'm so sorry.

37:23.840 --> 37:24.560
New question.

37:24.560 --> 37:29.440
I'm on a semester abroad in France, and there's some really cool girls here that I've met both

37:29.440 --> 37:31.200
English-speaking and not.

37:31.200 --> 37:35.200
I'd really like to take one out to dinner to get to know her better, but apparently in

37:35.200 --> 37:39.120
Europe, that is much too serious and reserved for actual couples.

37:39.680 --> 37:44.000
I feel like anything less than a date just puts me in the friend zone.

37:44.800 --> 37:48.320
How do I show interest in a girl without taking her on a date?

37:48.320 --> 37:52.720
That's from really confused in, I don't know, some French city, I think.

37:53.440 --> 37:54.320
I can't pronounce it.

37:55.360 --> 37:57.120
Some fur in place.

37:57.120 --> 37:58.480
Some fur in place.

37:58.480 --> 38:00.080
First off, friend zone is illusion.

38:00.640 --> 38:00.960
Yep.

38:00.960 --> 38:01.680
That doesn't exist.

38:01.680 --> 38:02.400
That doesn't exist.

38:03.200 --> 38:04.880
Second off, they're women, not girls.

38:04.880 --> 38:08.320
I guess just get all the classics out of the way.

38:09.120 --> 38:10.400
Now, let me get a country.

38:11.760 --> 38:12.880
It's a commonwealth.

38:12.880 --> 38:16.240
It is a union of nation-states.

38:16.240 --> 38:18.800
Let me get to the real meat of this question.

38:20.000 --> 38:27.360
What exactly about the last three and a half years we've all spent together have you said,

38:27.360 --> 38:35.200
boy, these guys have such a good handle on how relationships work in America, I bet that

38:35.200 --> 38:38.000
they're just experts about all around the globe.

38:38.000 --> 38:39.200
Do you really think that-

38:39.200 --> 38:41.440
They seem like intercontinental.

38:41.440 --> 38:44.160
They seem like intercontinental classy gentlemen.

38:44.160 --> 38:49.600
Do you think we got so smart about relationships in America that we've branched out to challenge

38:49.600 --> 38:50.160
ourselves?

38:50.160 --> 38:51.920
We don't know where to put hands.

38:51.920 --> 38:54.640
The only thing we could tell a guy is not to touch people's butts.

38:54.640 --> 38:56.480
That's where we're at, caveman status.

38:57.280 --> 39:03.600
Is it possible that it is simply, and I know you said English-speaking and non-English-speaking,

39:03.600 --> 39:09.680
but is it possible that it's just different connotations to hear when you say go on a

39:09.680 --> 39:13.840
date, it just means you're going one-on-one with the person to go do something?

39:14.560 --> 39:19.440
Maybe there, when you say go on a date, it just carries a different kind of weight?

39:19.440 --> 39:20.800
Because what difference is there?

39:20.800 --> 39:26.080
If you just said, hey, do you want to go hang out and see a movie, how is that different?

39:26.080 --> 39:28.160
Travis, I don't know.

39:28.160 --> 39:30.560
It's another goddamn country.

39:31.360 --> 39:31.760
I don't know.

39:31.760 --> 39:35.760
Because it seems to me like the question this person's asking is, hey, they don't want to

39:35.760 --> 39:36.560
call it a date.

39:37.200 --> 39:38.400
How do I still get to know him?

39:38.400 --> 39:41.840
By just hanging out?

39:41.840 --> 39:46.000
Just being around them and then listening to them talk and then interpreting the things

39:46.000 --> 39:49.120
they say and then storing that data in your brain?

39:49.120 --> 39:50.960
Without having to label it like an American?

39:50.960 --> 39:52.320
That's the problem.

39:52.320 --> 39:54.080
That's the issue.

39:54.080 --> 39:57.040
You got to think a little bit more European.

39:57.760 --> 40:00.720
Travis, you're going to Europe in a couple months.

40:00.720 --> 40:03.680
How have you started to recalibrate your thought patterns?

40:03.680 --> 40:04.880
Well, I got a passport.

40:04.880 --> 40:05.760
Sure, that's key.

40:05.760 --> 40:09.280
I'm driving on the other side of the road.

40:09.280 --> 40:11.120
Does this person have a passport?

40:11.120 --> 40:12.240
Do you have a passport?

40:12.240 --> 40:13.360
Have you checked their passport?

40:13.360 --> 40:15.040
That'd be a good way to learn some stuff about them.

40:15.040 --> 40:18.960
Let's see what passports are for them.

40:18.960 --> 40:20.880
Let's pack each other's bags for travel.

40:20.880 --> 40:21.920
Let me see all your visas.

40:24.560 --> 40:26.320
Can I check your receipts for travel?

40:26.320 --> 40:27.840
Do you have anything to declare?

40:27.840 --> 40:29.600
Have you brought any fruits and vegetables?

40:29.600 --> 40:30.160
Do you have any?

40:30.160 --> 40:31.600
Hey, just a quick question.

40:31.600 --> 40:33.280
Just to just quick get to know you.

40:33.280 --> 40:36.240
Have you got any foreign soils?

40:36.240 --> 40:38.640
Got any jars of foreign soils that you're sneaking in?

40:38.640 --> 40:42.560
I was wondering about your youth,

40:42.560 --> 40:46.160
and specifically your youth within the last three weeks,

40:46.160 --> 40:47.760
and have you interacted with any livestock?

40:50.240 --> 40:54.160
The Brothers McElroy told me that this is a social faux pas,

40:54.160 --> 40:56.800
but I'm going to have to stick my finger in your butthole

40:56.800 --> 40:59.280
just to make sure you don't got any foreign soils in there.

41:00.480 --> 41:01.520
Or livestock.

41:01.520 --> 41:02.480
I have a bit of a problem.

41:02.480 --> 41:02.800
Don't do it.

41:02.800 --> 41:04.160
Why are you trying to start a relationship

41:04.160 --> 41:06.320
that you know when the semester is over

41:06.320 --> 41:07.600
is just going to end in heartbreak?

41:07.600 --> 41:10.080
Didn't you see fucking Before Sunrise?

41:10.960 --> 41:12.480
Or After Sunset?

41:12.480 --> 41:14.800
Or After Sunset?

41:14.800 --> 41:16.720
Or From Dawn Till Dawn?

41:16.720 --> 41:17.440
1230.

41:18.800 --> 41:20.400
They had a movie called 1230.

41:20.400 --> 41:21.440
It was a minute long.

41:21.440 --> 41:22.480
They were at Hardee's,

41:22.480 --> 41:26.080
and they were drinking a triple thick milkshake.

41:26.080 --> 41:27.760
And at the very end of the movie, she's like,

41:28.960 --> 41:30.240
why are we eating it hot?

41:30.240 --> 41:33.280
And then credits.

41:33.280 --> 41:34.160
Haunting stuff.

41:34.160 --> 41:36.000
It is not Linklater's best work.

41:36.000 --> 41:38.240
In fact, I'll go out on a limb and call it his worst work.

41:40.640 --> 41:42.080
You know, that was the last movie Roger D.

41:42.080 --> 41:42.960
would ever saw.

41:42.960 --> 41:44.400
His quote upon leaving the theater was,

41:44.400 --> 41:45.200
oh man.

41:45.200 --> 41:45.760
Stop it.

41:46.640 --> 41:47.280
Not like this.

41:47.840 --> 41:48.400
Not like this.

41:48.400 --> 41:49.280
You guys want Yahoo?

41:49.280 --> 41:50.080
Not now.

41:50.080 --> 41:50.800
You guys want Yahoo!

41:50.800 --> 41:51.680
Night's Mystery?

41:51.680 --> 41:52.880
Yeah, please.

41:52.880 --> 41:53.440
This Yahoo!

41:53.440 --> 41:55.200
Night's Mystery was sent in by Nathan Hull.

41:55.200 --> 41:55.840
Thanks, Nathan.

41:55.840 --> 41:56.400
It's by Yahoo!

41:56.400 --> 41:58.080
Answers user Cassie, who asks,

41:58.080 --> 41:59.920
simple cosplay ideas for me.

42:00.880 --> 42:03.520
I really want to do a cosplay for crazy day at school,

42:04.320 --> 42:06.560
but I don't have any money to buy and thing.

42:08.080 --> 42:11.520
So is there a cosplay I can make with normal cloths,

42:11.520 --> 42:13.360
but still have it look cool?

42:13.360 --> 42:14.880
I have wavy shoulder length,

42:14.880 --> 42:16.160
blonde hair and blue eyes.

42:18.000 --> 42:18.500
Wait.

42:20.560 --> 42:21.760
So she's asking,

42:22.720 --> 42:25.600
is there a cosplay I can do without dressing up?

42:25.600 --> 42:27.120
No, no, no.

42:27.120 --> 42:30.160
She has normal cloths, not a big budget.

42:31.200 --> 42:32.000
She needs a lot of bang.

42:32.000 --> 42:34.080
And give me her look one more time.

42:34.080 --> 42:36.000
Shoulder length, blonde hair and blue eyes.

42:36.000 --> 42:37.680
Wavy, wavy ass hair.

42:37.680 --> 42:39.760
Oh, well that's, wait.

42:39.760 --> 42:40.240
Is that Buffy?

42:40.240 --> 42:41.280
Could she do Buffy?

42:41.280 --> 42:43.360
No, I'm thinking more like a Carrie Bradshaw.

42:44.160 --> 42:45.680
You could go as Carrie Bradshaw.

42:45.680 --> 42:47.840
That's a pretty lazy answer.

42:47.840 --> 42:49.200
Expecting a little bit more from you.

42:50.160 --> 42:52.240
You could go as Carrie Bradshaw's evil twin.

42:52.880 --> 42:53.380
Bane.

42:53.380 --> 42:54.740
Carrie Bradshaw's evil twin.

42:55.380 --> 42:56.260
Barry Bradshaw.

42:56.980 --> 42:57.860
Barry Bradshaw.

42:58.820 --> 43:00.260
That sounds more like a football player.

43:00.980 --> 43:02.340
You could go as a football player.

43:05.380 --> 43:07.300
Maybe it's like a scary doctor.

43:09.540 --> 43:12.500
Are you just naming things that women can be?

43:12.500 --> 43:14.980
Like is that just our, here's a list of things.

43:14.980 --> 43:17.460
I was evolving more into like Halloween costumes.

43:18.260 --> 43:21.380
At least he went fairly progressive down that line.

43:21.940 --> 43:22.500
Yeah.

43:22.500 --> 43:23.380
Women can be doctors.

43:23.380 --> 43:24.660
Women can be football players.

43:25.300 --> 43:26.340
They can be ghosts.

43:26.340 --> 43:27.780
They can be, women can be ghosts.

43:31.060 --> 43:32.820
Hey, women can be mummies too, you know.

43:33.940 --> 43:35.700
Such a narrow-minded point of view.

43:36.260 --> 43:38.820
All mummies are women, otherwise they're duddies.

43:40.660 --> 43:41.780
That joke was a duddy.

43:45.060 --> 43:45.860
Like Duddy Rock?

43:45.860 --> 43:47.060
Like Sean Paul?

43:48.020 --> 43:49.300
I'm sorry, what?

43:49.300 --> 43:54.340
Take that, Duddy, Duddy, Sean Paul, Sean Paul.

43:55.220 --> 43:56.260
You could be Sean Paul.

43:56.260 --> 43:57.860
Could you cosplay as Sean Paul?

43:57.860 --> 43:59.220
No one knows what he looks like anyways.

43:59.220 --> 44:00.100
The man's a mystery.

44:00.980 --> 44:03.140
Sean Paul is constantly changing.

44:03.140 --> 44:04.580
Sean Paul is anonymous.

44:04.580 --> 44:05.700
Sean Paul is Guy Fawkes.

44:07.780 --> 44:09.700
It's hard to hear him at his concerts through his mask.

44:09.700 --> 44:15.540
Can you take the mask off, Sean Paul?

44:22.260 --> 44:25.700
Another thing you didn't know about Sean Paul is he's not a person.

44:25.700 --> 44:27.220
According to his Wikipedia page,

44:28.020 --> 44:32.100
Duddy Rock is the second album by reggae dancehall toaster Sean Paul.

44:32.740 --> 44:34.420
So he's been a toaster this whole time.

44:36.980 --> 44:38.020
You didn't suspect that.

44:38.020 --> 44:39.860
He certainly has good flow for a toaster.

44:45.380 --> 44:46.900
Your toast is done.

44:46.900 --> 44:47.940
It's brown on country.

44:51.380 --> 44:53.300
Oh man, all these are so terrible.

44:53.300 --> 44:57.220
Sorry, Sean Paul, but if you're unpopular for long enough, you get on the list.

45:00.340 --> 45:05.700
Our fucking random list of people that we summoned from the grave,

45:05.700 --> 45:10.180
like Dr. Frankenstein, to turn into comedy tubes for our podcast.

45:11.380 --> 45:13.300
Should have had a hit, son.

45:15.860 --> 45:18.740
I imagine him and Duffy just sharing a long embrace.

45:18.740 --> 45:19.380
Like, it's okay.

45:20.820 --> 45:23.780
Welcome to my brother, my brother and me, bullied anonymous.

45:24.580 --> 45:25.780
Please, no names.

45:26.580 --> 45:28.020
Just the names that they gave us.

45:28.020 --> 45:30.740
Duffy, Squinto, Sean Paul the toaster.

45:32.980 --> 45:33.540
Welcome.

45:33.540 --> 45:37.380
Welcome. I haven't been mentioned on my brother, my brother and me in three months.

45:38.980 --> 45:39.620
So proud of you.

45:43.700 --> 45:44.740
That's the problem.

45:44.740 --> 45:49.940
See, you have people like French Stewart who crawled their way back into relevance

45:49.940 --> 45:53.140
by getting back onto TV and then we can't talk about him anymore.

45:53.700 --> 45:54.260
No.

45:54.260 --> 45:55.540
Apparently, oh, by the way, you fucked up.

45:55.540 --> 45:56.980
Duffy is on Dallas, too.

45:56.980 --> 45:58.420
So we're gonna have to scratch him off the list.

45:58.420 --> 46:00.980
And he's also not on Dukes of Hazzard.

46:00.980 --> 46:03.780
No, he's not?

46:03.780 --> 46:04.180
No.

46:04.180 --> 46:05.300
Patrick Duffy wasn't in Dukes of Hazzard.

46:05.300 --> 46:05.940
It was Tom Wopat.

46:07.220 --> 46:07.460
Wow.

46:07.460 --> 46:09.700
It was Wopat and the dad from Smallville.

46:09.700 --> 46:11.860
Well, I mean.

46:13.220 --> 46:14.100
What? Say it.

46:14.100 --> 46:14.900
You say potato.

46:15.780 --> 46:16.740
You say Wopato.

46:19.540 --> 46:20.580
How about another question?

46:20.580 --> 46:22.820
Wow, you are 100% right, Travis.

46:22.820 --> 46:24.740
He was not on the Dukes of Hazzard.

46:25.860 --> 46:26.500
Yeah.

46:26.500 --> 46:28.260
He absolutely was not.

46:28.820 --> 46:29.300
It's okay.

46:29.300 --> 46:31.460
We'll get it in the Corrections and Attractions episode.

46:31.460 --> 46:32.980
I'll be like, that's what-

46:32.980 --> 46:34.180
Episode 200.

46:34.180 --> 46:37.220
Episode 200 is gonna be like things we fucked up through history.

46:37.220 --> 46:37.460
And it's gonna be-

46:37.460 --> 46:38.180
Four hours.

46:38.180 --> 46:39.380
It's gonna be a very long one.

46:43.940 --> 46:45.860
I have a bit of a problem involving two friends.

46:45.860 --> 46:48.740
These friends of mine have been in a relationship for a good few months now.

46:48.740 --> 46:52.260
However, it is common for them to show their affection for one another in public.

46:52.260 --> 46:56.180
It has even come to the point in which it can be rude, for example.

46:56.180 --> 46:57.300
I would be talking to one of them.

46:57.300 --> 46:59.380
Then the other will interrupt our conversation.

46:59.380 --> 47:01.860
And they'll start smooching each other.

47:02.660 --> 47:07.460
Is it not just me that has an issue with this number of our friends also find it uncomfortable?

47:08.420 --> 47:11.140
What would you guys do in this situation?

47:11.140 --> 47:15.300
So it's like you're talking about the latest episode of America's Next Top Model.

47:15.300 --> 47:18.180
And then one of your friends is like, oh, hold up, smooch break.

47:18.180 --> 47:21.380
I don't even think they're that polite about it.

47:21.380 --> 47:22.740
I don't even think they interject like,

47:22.740 --> 47:26.100
hold on, talking time is about to be put on hold while I get my smooch on.

47:26.100 --> 47:34.900
Can you slide, can you crouch down low and then very slowly slide your face in between their faces?

47:35.940 --> 47:37.540
And get kisses on your cheek.

47:37.540 --> 47:39.380
I'm just gonna, excuse me.

47:39.380 --> 47:41.540
Excuse me, let me just, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

47:41.540 --> 47:45.220
So yeah, on the latest episode, Cory pulls this great prank.

47:47.940 --> 47:51.140
I feel like if you made your displeasure with that known just like once,

47:51.140 --> 47:53.460
it would be enough to shame them into stopping, right?

47:53.460 --> 47:57.860
I mean, have you said like, hey, that's kind of rude.

47:57.860 --> 48:00.020
Like, just say that.

48:00.020 --> 48:02.180
Why is it like, hey, could you guys cool it a bit?

48:02.180 --> 48:03.060
Just say that.

48:04.740 --> 48:06.500
That's a little, do you know why?

48:06.500 --> 48:06.980
Do you know why?

48:06.980 --> 48:11.700
Because I'm developing a theory on this and I believe it is because in real life,

48:12.260 --> 48:17.700
people would rather have that thing in their group that everybody can form around

48:17.700 --> 48:20.420
and kind of bitch about quietly behind people's backs

48:20.420 --> 48:24.580
than just address it and have it be done because it's more interesting.

48:24.580 --> 48:26.500
Oh my God, you are getting real.

48:27.220 --> 48:29.380
Yeah, right, but like I've seen that happen.

48:29.380 --> 48:30.660
I've done that before where it's like,

48:30.660 --> 48:33.860
it's more fun to bitch about the person behind their back

48:33.860 --> 48:36.500
than it is to actually take steps to fix the problem.

48:36.500 --> 48:39.940
Travis, that is such a good reminder and I think we've gone too long

48:39.940 --> 48:44.820
without reminding people that it is, it is 2013.

48:44.820 --> 48:45.300
That's true.

48:45.300 --> 48:49.620
You are supposed to be getting out the dirt, washing it out, shaking it out.

48:49.620 --> 48:51.700
And well, you can't really wash dirt, can you?

48:53.860 --> 48:56.420
I'm just saying the thing you said, the thing you said was dumb and wrong.

48:59.300 --> 49:02.340
When you try to wash dirt, it turns into mud and that's not especially clean.

49:03.060 --> 49:05.380
Okay, then when you try to wash mud, it just goes away.

49:05.380 --> 49:07.540
Okay, so then you're left with nothing.

49:07.540 --> 49:09.780
You gotta bleach it and teach it, you know what I mean?

49:10.980 --> 49:12.100
I don't know what that means.

49:12.100 --> 49:12.740
I don't either.

49:12.740 --> 49:15.380
Doesn't rhyme with 13 either, so what the fuck are you doing?

49:15.380 --> 49:18.580
You gotta clean it and-

49:18.580 --> 49:21.700
Clean rhymes with 13, like stop, put that part at the end.

49:21.700 --> 49:23.300
You gotta clean it and screen it.

49:25.540 --> 49:27.780
The screen keeps more of it from coming back.

49:27.780 --> 49:29.620
So you clean it and then you screen it out.

49:29.620 --> 49:31.060
Okay, wrap your friends-

49:31.060 --> 49:33.140
2013, screen it and clean it.

49:33.140 --> 49:35.140
Wrap your friends in a protective screen.

49:35.140 --> 49:37.620
Have you thought about like a Faraday cage for your friends?

49:40.180 --> 49:42.900
Oh, put your two friends in two separate Faraday cages

49:42.900 --> 49:44.420
and that will keep them from coming back.

49:44.420 --> 49:48.020
And that will keep their kissing electrons from meeting.

49:48.020 --> 49:51.140
Put your friends in a box and then put a vial

49:51.780 --> 49:53.860
full of harmful radiation in that box.

49:53.860 --> 49:54.740
Maybe it'll break.

49:54.740 --> 49:55.700
Maybe your friends are dead.

49:55.700 --> 49:56.660
Maybe they're not.

49:56.660 --> 49:59.220
You are existing in two universes simultaneously

49:59.220 --> 50:02.180
where your friends are both necking and not necking.

50:02.180 --> 50:03.300
Isn't that a little bit better?

50:04.340 --> 50:04.900
No?

50:04.900 --> 50:05.300
Okay.

50:05.300 --> 50:05.940
Nope.

50:05.940 --> 50:09.460
You're overwhelmed with existential dread?

50:09.460 --> 50:09.940
Oh no.

50:12.100 --> 50:12.740
Not again.

50:12.740 --> 50:13.860
Not again, sorry.

50:13.860 --> 50:14.500
We're not very good at this.

50:14.500 --> 50:15.540
Or maybe not again.

50:16.660 --> 50:17.460
We don't know.

50:17.460 --> 50:18.180
We're not sure.

50:18.180 --> 50:18.980
Open the box.

50:18.980 --> 50:19.940
Don't open the box.

50:19.940 --> 50:20.820
Don't open it.

50:20.820 --> 50:22.020
Don't open that box.

50:22.020 --> 50:22.580
But open it.

50:22.580 --> 50:23.300
Not until Christmas.

50:23.300 --> 50:24.420
You're gonna see some limbs.

50:25.780 --> 50:26.020
Limbs all-

50:26.020 --> 50:26.820
It's a Kimbo.

50:26.820 --> 50:27.620
All a Kimbo.

50:28.420 --> 50:31.540
It's gonna look like two giant Guy Fone Stevens in there.

50:34.260 --> 50:37.620
Hey, thank you so much for hanging out with us again for another hour.

50:37.620 --> 50:41.140
We hope you've enjoyed yourself half as much as we have.

50:41.140 --> 50:41.940
Thank you to those Tweety Bucks-

50:41.940 --> 50:43.140
That seems about accurate.

50:43.140 --> 50:43.700
Yeah.

50:43.700 --> 50:44.500
Matt Oldenburg.

50:45.460 --> 50:47.460
I didn't enjoy myself all that much.

50:47.460 --> 50:47.940
So 50% of that-

50:47.940 --> 50:49.620
I will hope you don't put the muddle through it.

50:49.620 --> 50:49.860
Yeah.

50:49.860 --> 50:50.580
Just like we did.

51:03.620 --> 51:05.060
Thank you so much for sharing the show.

51:05.060 --> 51:06.020
We sure appreciate it.

51:08.100 --> 51:08.600
A lot.

51:09.700 --> 51:11.940
I want to thank John Roderick in the long winters.

51:11.940 --> 51:14.100
I want to put myself out there,

51:14.100 --> 51:16.100
make myself a little vulnerable for a second,

51:16.100 --> 51:18.260
and just thank John Roderick in the long winters

51:18.260 --> 51:19.220
for the use of our theme song,

51:19.220 --> 51:20.340
It's a Departure,

51:20.340 --> 51:21.860
off the album Putting the Days to Bed.

51:21.860 --> 51:22.660
Heard a lot of people say,

51:22.660 --> 51:24.260
Griffin, I bought Putting the Days to Bed.

51:24.260 --> 51:25.460
Where do I go now?

51:25.460 --> 51:26.820
How about when I pretend to fall?

51:27.380 --> 51:29.540
How about the other one?

51:31.220 --> 51:32.900
The Name of Which Escapes Me.

51:32.900 --> 51:34.740
The Name of Which I Cannot Recall.

51:34.740 --> 51:36.820
That would be a badass name for an album.

51:36.820 --> 51:37.780
How about-

51:37.780 --> 51:39.060
The Name of Which Escapes Me.

51:39.060 --> 51:40.660
There's the Ultimatum EP.

51:40.660 --> 51:41.940
That's one.

51:41.940 --> 51:43.140
Lot of albums.

51:43.140 --> 51:44.020
Maybe four or five.

51:45.780 --> 51:47.300
Then John Roderick will make more for us.

51:48.660 --> 51:49.860
He's just been waiting for you.

51:50.740 --> 51:52.900
This whole podcast is basically a pyramid scheme

51:52.900 --> 51:54.580
to get people to buy Long Winter's albums

51:54.580 --> 51:55.460
so he can get that new one.

51:55.460 --> 51:56.420
Anyway, thanks John Roderick.

51:56.420 --> 51:57.220
Thanks Long Winters.

52:13.540 --> 52:15.460
It's not all about pee pee.

52:15.460 --> 52:15.860
I mean-

52:15.860 --> 52:17.780
I listened to this week's episode.

52:17.780 --> 52:20.580
You guys talk about nothing but urine on your show.

52:20.580 --> 52:22.740
It's a medical history show, but okay.

52:22.740 --> 52:23.700
Anyway, there's lots of other shows.

52:23.700 --> 52:28.180
If you want to listen to a pee pee cast,

I have the last one, yeah.

52:37.380 --> 52:38.020
The last one.

52:38.740 --> 52:40.500
