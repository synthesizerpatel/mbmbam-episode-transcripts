00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:47.760
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me, an advice show for the

00:47.760 --> 00:51.840
modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis

00:51.840 --> 00:55.440
McElroy. I'm your sweet baby brother, 30 under 30 media luminary, Griffin McElroy.

00:56.080 --> 01:00.000
Which one are we doing? Okay, we're doing a watch-watch. I know, but we need to pick the

01:00.000 --> 01:07.760
film for it. Here's the thing. They're all so good. Okay. They're literally all so good.

01:07.760 --> 01:11.920
Sometimes we talk about new movies in the intro, and we watch out for them.

01:13.600 --> 01:21.120
We could do a circle watch, and it's about what if Facebook was bad. Yeah, but like,

01:21.120 --> 01:26.960
some would argue it is. Oh, dang. See, there'd be a lot of material there if we wanted to go with

01:26.960 --> 01:32.480
that as the watch, because I could do a whole, like, I get all these, you know, Dragon Puzzle

01:32.480 --> 01:37.680
Kingdom invite. No, this isn't, that won't do. We could do Sleight, but I actually am, like,

01:37.680 --> 01:43.520
legit excited to see Sleight, but maybe there's some, like, we could maybe tie it to the Now You

01:43.520 --> 01:49.440
See Me verse. Fate of the Furious. Didn't talk about the new, oh, wait a minute. I got it. I

01:49.440 --> 01:54.400
got it. I got it. I got it. All right. Ooga chaka, ooga, ooga, ooga chaka. Where are we going?

01:54.400 --> 02:01.200
The Guardians of the Galaxy are back. Hey, them. Yeah, I'm watching out for them, because they're

02:01.200 --> 02:10.080
back in a big way. The whole team is back. Superman, Batman, Chris Pratt, all the dinosaurs.

02:11.440 --> 02:19.040
The Parks and Rec gang are in this one. Wow. Plant woman, tree, small tree, raccoon gun haver.

02:19.040 --> 02:25.840
Condor man. There's a, actually, this one's got seven raccoons. They've upped the stakes.

02:25.840 --> 02:31.920
Whoa. Yeah, there's a tree, and there's a strong fella, and then there's, like, eight or nine

02:31.920 --> 02:36.000
raccoons. Fuck these raccoons and fuck Guardians of the Galaxy and everybody involved with it.

02:36.000 --> 02:41.440
I'm here to talk about Chuck. It's back. They did it. We got it six seasons in a movie,

02:41.440 --> 02:48.000
and he's back playing Chuck, and he's doing, is he a spy or not? Yvonne Stravinsky is here too,

02:48.000 --> 02:51.600
and she is definitely a spy, and I just clicked through, and this is apparently a boxing movie

02:51.600 --> 02:56.960
with Liev Shriver, which is good. Friend of the show. Friend of the show, Liev Shriver.

02:56.960 --> 03:00.800
I was hoping it was Chuck-Chuck, because I do want to talk about my theory that Chuck is just

03:00.800 --> 03:04.800
a gritty reboot of the Computer War Tennessee. I won't let you talk about that on our podcast

03:04.800 --> 03:08.240
fucking ever again. You've done it once. Have I brought it up before? Yeah, but you've done it

03:08.240 --> 03:13.520
before. I want to go back to Boss Baby now. Still making a lot of money. I will say that,

03:13.520 --> 03:19.520
making money hand over pudgy fist is Boss Baby. Boss Baby. Alec Baldwin is back as Jack Donaghy,

03:19.520 --> 03:27.200
a baby from 30 Rock. He's a baby. What I love about this, I have a baby now, but he doesn't talk.

03:27.200 --> 03:31.440
He's not Alec Baldwin. He doesn't wear little suits and do whatever this wonderful baby does

03:31.440 --> 03:37.280
in this movie, so now I can look at my baby, and I'll be swept away into a world of make-believe

03:37.280 --> 03:43.280
and stuff. If you're listening, creators of Boss Baby, and it might be a little late now,

03:43.280 --> 03:46.720
because your movie's out, but I would like to pitch a tagline for you. A little late. Yeah,

03:46.720 --> 03:50.480
a little bit late for it. But here's a tagline. Look who's talking now.

03:52.640 --> 04:00.080
And it's like Q, look who's talking now. A, this wild baby. A baby. Yeah. It's a baby.

04:00.080 --> 04:07.280
A baby in a suit. Who ever heard of such a thing? His parents are putting him in those suits.

04:07.280 --> 04:14.880
What's the story with the Boss Baby? This is like the one animated film I haven't seen.

04:14.880 --> 04:18.560
I haven't seen it either, but I would like to theorize, just based on the three seconds of

04:18.560 --> 04:25.520
trailer I've seen, what I think Boss Baby's about. My theory, the boss is a fully grown person who

04:25.520 --> 04:31.280
has been cursed to be a baby to remember what life was like before he cared about only business.

04:31.280 --> 04:35.760
About money. So at the end of the movie, he realizes his mistake. He's transformed back

04:35.760 --> 04:40.240
into a fully grown adult, which makes for, I would say, a pretty rough day for his parents.

04:40.240 --> 04:40.740
Yes.

04:43.440 --> 04:45.600
Remember? It's like a dancing Boss Baby.

04:45.600 --> 04:49.280
Okay, you've confused me because that's the second time you've done that in the intro bit.

04:49.280 --> 04:53.680
It's just hard for me to get on board with a watch about some

04:53.680 --> 04:56.720
little baby that I don't care about. Some Alec Baldwin baby.

04:57.440 --> 05:03.680
Honestly, God, I find it hard, and this is not a joke, to care about any watch other than Trolls

05:03.680 --> 05:09.680
2. I'm looking so far forward, it's hard to be in the now.

05:09.680 --> 05:13.360
I'm looking forward to that. Griffin, did you see the new Fast and Furious movie?

05:13.360 --> 05:21.680
No, I missed it. I haven't seen it yet. I know that my big friend Vin Diesel turns on his family,

05:21.680 --> 05:26.400
and I'm just okay pretending that this one doesn't exist, I guess. If that's the route they want to

05:26.400 --> 05:30.240
go, here's the route I'm going to go. Not to the movie theater. I'll go to the Baskin Robbins

05:30.240 --> 05:34.320
instead, or something. Find some better way to spend my time if you're going to betray my family

05:34.320 --> 05:37.760
like that. And that's five minutes. Okay, all right, now-

05:37.760 --> 05:41.120
Jesus Christ, I can't believe how long we talked about Boss Baby.

05:43.360 --> 05:47.760
That's longer than I- I mean, we went 30 seconds over. We could have stopped back there a while ago.

05:47.760 --> 05:54.240
I mean, you're assuming that that was all just a pure, gonna make the show, unedited,

05:54.240 --> 06:00.160
fucking non-stop guild. I'm not saying Boss Baby's a bad film. I'm saying I don't know the Boss Baby.

06:00.160 --> 06:02.800
I don't know the Boss Baby. I'm looking at a picture, and he looks very smug, and he's holding

06:02.800 --> 06:07.040
a cookie, which like, you're a baby. If you ate that, you'd die. You know what I mean?

06:07.760 --> 06:10.480
Yeah, for sure. Babies can't have cookies?

06:11.360 --> 06:15.280
No, not when they're that small. They don't know how to chew or whatever. Does the Boss Baby have

06:15.280 --> 06:20.560
teeth? Uh-oh, oh shit, Travis has to go. I'll be right back. He has some chips on-

06:20.560 --> 06:26.800
I'll just text my wife. It'll be fine. She's just jamming cookies in her baby's mouth,

06:27.680 --> 06:34.160
like some sort of human gachapon machine. I have this friend that every time I bring up

06:34.160 --> 06:38.800
something interesting, I find out they always answer with, you didn't know? Are they lying

06:38.800 --> 06:43.840
to me and actually not know either? Or do they actually have vast knowledge of fun facts and news?

06:43.840 --> 06:50.800
That's from Aaron, Cincinnati. God, what a bummer. What a shitty, bad one. What a shitty thing.

06:51.920 --> 06:54.800
Yeah, that's a- no, I think your friend's a dick. I don't think they're a computer who

06:54.800 --> 06:58.720
wore tennis shoes. Let's Occam's Razor this one. Either your friend has this bad habit,

06:58.720 --> 07:03.120
or they are Kirk Cameron in tennis shoes with a Google brain, and I don't think-

07:03.920 --> 07:07.200
I don't think Kirk Cameron's got a Google brain, and I don't think you're friends with him,

07:07.200 --> 07:11.600
if that were true. So I think it may just be a sort of a nasty habit that-

07:11.600 --> 07:18.080
It also doesn't matter which is the answer, because that's not how you're supposed to respond

07:18.880 --> 07:20.800
to humans. Yeah, that's not how it's done.

07:20.800 --> 07:23.840
Well, I mean, he's got a fucking computer. He's got a Google brain, Travis.

07:23.840 --> 07:27.200
But even then, Griffin, if you had a Google brain and someone was like,

07:27.200 --> 07:32.160
oh, Boss Baby is already out in theaters, you would respond like, yeah, duh. You didn't know

07:32.160 --> 07:36.640
that? Get out of here. There's a better way to handle that exchange.

07:36.640 --> 07:45.360
Yeah. No, your friend is an omnipresent, omni-knowledge-having. They probably know

07:45.360 --> 07:51.440
what the word is that I would try to get there. But yeah, no, it's just your friend has a bad

07:51.440 --> 07:54.960
habit. How do you fix this? This is a bad one, though.

07:54.960 --> 07:56.800
You're going to have to honeypot this.

07:57.360 --> 07:58.160
Oh, shit.

07:58.160 --> 08:02.560
You're going to have to come up with some facts that ain't facts.

08:03.680 --> 08:05.840
Oh, my God. I did this.

08:05.840 --> 08:07.200
What did you do?

08:07.200 --> 08:12.240
In elementary school, we had a friend who was like this, and he would claim

08:12.960 --> 08:20.960
to know all the stuff. And we came up with a sequel to Goonies.

08:21.840 --> 08:29.520
And we started talking a lot about Goonies 2. And did he know about Goonies 2? And was he excited

08:29.520 --> 08:36.080
about it? And he claimed to have known about Goonies 2 for a while. Not the NES game,

08:36.080 --> 08:41.120
Goonies 2, which I know existed. Thank you, Twitter. You can fucking close the app. I got you.

08:42.560 --> 08:47.360
I got you. And now tweet at me that I got you. If I did just get you, by the way.

08:47.360 --> 08:49.440
You got to own up to it.

08:49.440 --> 08:51.040
Tweet at me that I got you, okay?

08:51.040 --> 08:55.520
You don't realize you're this friend and Justin just honeypotted our entire listenership.

08:55.520 --> 09:04.320
Yeah, but he really buckled down on Goonies 2 existing and his knowledge of the film.

09:06.000 --> 09:09.200
And that's how we finally got him. I don't think there was a prestige here. That would

09:09.200 --> 09:12.880
have been great if we had that. I don't think we had a term.

09:12.880 --> 09:18.880
Well, the prestige would have been that Goonies 2 really did exist. And his dad really was an

09:18.880 --> 09:24.560
executive producer on it. And he really did get an early screener. And he would put you back in

09:24.560 --> 09:27.840
your place, which that would be horrible for you. It'd be great for me, though, because I'd love

09:27.840 --> 09:30.640
a Goonies 2. I would love to see all those kids go on another treasure hunt.

09:31.440 --> 09:34.080
Yeah, I would love that. Now, do you know how big that would be?

09:34.080 --> 09:34.640
It would be the biggest.

09:34.640 --> 09:35.040
Are you kidding me?

09:35.040 --> 09:35.840
It would be the biggest ever.

09:35.840 --> 09:36.720
Two Toonies?

09:37.520 --> 09:38.080
Toonies?

09:39.920 --> 09:41.200
How about Yahoo?

09:42.160 --> 09:42.640
Yeah, do it.

09:42.640 --> 09:46.640
This was sent in by Morgan Davey. Keep it wavy, Morgan Davey. Thank you. It's Yahoo Answers user

09:46.640 --> 09:51.600
Bunny who asks, can you name all of Steve Urkel's catchphrase?

09:52.720 --> 09:54.080
And then additional details.

09:54.080 --> 09:58.560
Can you name all of Steve Urkel's catchphrase? There's no question mark on that one.

09:59.760 --> 10:04.640
So it's sort of the subhead on this one kind of got a little, like, there's a desperation to it.

10:05.360 --> 10:05.760
Let's see.

10:05.760 --> 10:06.080
Please.

10:08.160 --> 10:12.880
Before we get, I know we're about to just pull out our funny bones and just slam them against

10:12.880 --> 10:15.760
the table. But before we do that, I mean, did I do that?

10:16.720 --> 10:19.760
Oh, were you going to be funny? Because I was going to see if I could really do it. Got any

10:19.760 --> 10:25.040
cheese? I feel like that went away around the middle of like season two. But got any cheese

10:25.040 --> 10:25.760
was huge.

10:25.760 --> 10:31.280
It's rare that they phase out a catchphrase, huh? They're like, guys, I just don't think got any

10:31.280 --> 10:37.600
cheese is really penetrating the market audience. I don't know. Maybe he's not. Maybe he's not

10:37.600 --> 10:39.360
cheese obsessed as a character trait.

10:40.240 --> 10:45.280
There's not while I'm pouring. That was repeated numerous times.

10:45.280 --> 10:46.480
Wait, really?

10:46.480 --> 10:49.840
Someone would try to talk to him whilst pouring a mixture and he would say,

10:49.840 --> 10:53.840
Shh, not while I'm pouring. And I'm not even joking that happened at least,

10:54.560 --> 10:57.040
I would say at least five times, if not more. So I think that-

10:57.040 --> 10:59.680
Well, at least that's not a joke in any way.

11:00.320 --> 11:06.000
Yeah, that is actually just science safety. Like he was pouring dangerous chemicals and

11:06.000 --> 11:07.680
people were trying to fucking talk to him.

11:07.680 --> 11:12.800
You can lay a lot of slams down at Urkel's feet, but he was a very, very safe scientist.

11:12.800 --> 11:14.880
He kept a clean laboratory.

11:14.880 --> 11:20.800
What about whoa mama, right? Did he do that where he grabbed the glasses kind of?

11:20.800 --> 11:26.400
Yes, whoa mama was definitely one of them. That one was listed by Yahoo member KO71 who says,

11:26.400 --> 11:30.880
Did I do that? Who mama? Which is a different, but close and good.

11:30.880 --> 11:33.840
This user also swears by the following catchphrases.

11:33.840 --> 11:38.400
Sorry, Carl, was one I guess he probably said a lot because he did foul up Carl's,

11:38.400 --> 11:39.920
I think, evening a lot.

11:39.920 --> 11:42.320
That just seems like human interaction. I don't know if that counts.

11:42.320 --> 11:46.160
There weren't any t-shirts that just said, Sorry, Carl.

11:46.160 --> 11:51.120
And then there was one that's, Hi, Laura. And that is just sort of a greeting that people say

11:51.120 --> 11:57.920
to each other. And then of course, the timeless catchphrase that user KO71 loves this one is,

11:58.720 --> 12:00.160
I've made a new invention.

12:02.320 --> 12:08.240
Do you remember when Urkel would say, Everyone, I've made a new invention.

12:08.240 --> 12:13.680
And the audience would just laugh and laugh and scream and woo. I've made a new invention.

12:14.800 --> 12:19.360
I'm Urkel. I've made a new invention. I love it.

12:21.360 --> 12:25.040
The weirdest part about that is once you got to season four, they just had him barrel.

12:25.040 --> 12:28.320
Just like look right down the camera and say, I've made a new invention.

12:28.320 --> 12:28.880
Right, he would-

12:28.880 --> 12:31.120
Not even in his Urkel voice.

12:31.120 --> 12:35.920
He would kick open the door to the Winslow household and step inside and the audience

12:35.920 --> 12:40.240
would applaud for seven minutes and he would look right down the fucking barrel and he would just

12:40.240 --> 12:42.560
say, I've made a new invention.

12:42.560 --> 12:49.680
I like the ones where someone would walk in and find Steve Urkel in their kitchen and he would

12:49.680 --> 12:56.640
say, I've been in your kitchen for 15 minutes. Every time they did it, the minutes would be

12:56.640 --> 13:01.600
different. So sometimes it was like, I've been in your kitchen for 12 minutes. And it was just

13:01.600 --> 13:07.040
kind of tracking because it was in real time. Every Family Matters episode was in real time.

13:07.040 --> 13:11.120
Yeah, that's the best part about it. You could turn it on any time of day to see what the Winslows

13:11.120 --> 13:12.160
and Urkels were up to.

13:12.160 --> 13:15.920
And then the Winslow, whatever Winslow family member he says that to or he fesses up to being

13:15.920 --> 13:19.440
in the kitchen, that family member is just like, better make sure all the cheese isn't

13:19.440 --> 13:21.440
gone. And he's like, I don't fucking do that anymore.

13:21.440 --> 13:27.280
I don't do that anymore. My favorite Steve Urkel catchphrase was every time he would say,

13:27.280 --> 13:31.520
I trapped my parents in an alternate dimension so that I could have full domain over the house.

13:31.520 --> 13:36.000
Yeah, I remember that one. I've made a new invention. It's a pocket dimension for my parents.

13:37.040 --> 13:43.840
I had a little chuckle earlier because in Googling trying to find a more complete list,

13:44.720 --> 13:51.200
I found a story from HuffPost TV. And the headline of this piece, this dates back to 2015

13:51.200 --> 13:55.120
when Jaleel White, who is an accomplished performer in his own right, but of course

13:55.120 --> 14:00.080
is best known as Steve Urkel, was appearing on Worst Cooks in America Celebrity Edition.

14:00.080 --> 14:06.880
And the quote in this piece is, I might've had a, did I do that moment on the show, said White,

14:07.600 --> 14:13.760
to which HuffPost replied, did you do that? And he said, you'll have to watch the show,

14:13.760 --> 14:18.160
laughed White. I don't think you're going to be disappointed in my participation.

14:18.160 --> 14:26.640
The headline of this news post is Jaleel White hints he's bringing back his Steve Urkel catchphrase.

14:26.640 --> 14:35.280
And it's like, it's not, it's not, the headline of this story is there's some scuttlebutt,

14:35.280 --> 14:41.760
there's some vague hints that somewhere Jaleel White said out loud, did I do that? And cameras

14:41.760 --> 14:48.080
filmed it and you can see it. Can you believe it? Now we don't know that for sure, but there's a

14:48.080 --> 14:53.520
hint that this, that he did say, did I do that on a camera, in front of a camera.

14:53.520 --> 15:02.320
Jaleel White potentially made quote, new invention. Oh, gotta, gotta get on it.

15:02.320 --> 15:06.000
He greeted someone named Laura and apologized to someone named Carl,

15:06.000 --> 15:09.280
but we haven't been able to pin down whether or not it was the same character.

15:11.120 --> 15:15.040
This viral video of Jaleel White on a subway train when he stepped on a man named Carl's

15:15.040 --> 15:19.520
foot and then greeted a friend named Laura who boarded the train. People lost their fucking minds.

15:19.520 --> 15:27.440
Do you guys remember the episode, it was a whole arc where Steve Urkel, using a jetpack,

15:27.440 --> 15:33.680
reached the step-by-step universe and took one of the daughters to a dance and did the Urkel?

15:33.680 --> 15:38.160
I thought you were going to say, using the jetpack took one of the daughters back to

15:38.160 --> 15:44.720
Family Matters. What's up, Skip? You're on Family Matters now. Your brood is mine now.

15:44.720 --> 15:52.080
I've bred the lines. Your brood is mine now, Duke boy.

15:53.440 --> 15:58.560
Wait, you know about Dukes of Hazzard? In this reality? Yeah. What? In my rea- well,

15:58.560 --> 16:04.480
this is Patrick Duffy. Oh yes, okay. He's down, step-by-step. Mr. Matthews, I'm very disa- oh man,

16:05.280 --> 16:11.360
a nerdy child with a jetpack is grabbing me, I'm gone, bye. You're on Family Matters now, Feeny.

16:11.360 --> 16:14.800
I'm in your- I'm recruiting anything Avengers.

16:18.320 --> 16:20.880
He's not answering. Yeah, he got taken to Family Matters.

16:20.880 --> 16:24.000
He doesn't live in that house anymore. He's on Family Matters, he got taken.

16:25.440 --> 16:28.400
They need a lot of entertainment. Please bring me from this prison, Mr. Urkel.

16:28.400 --> 16:32.000
They need a lot of characters to fill 24 hours of daily programming,

16:32.000 --> 16:35.280
so they had to recruit some other people. All right, here's another question.

16:36.160 --> 16:41.120
A few months ago, I drunkenly agreed to be in a friend's band, thinking nothing would come of it.

16:41.120 --> 16:44.480
Now he's beginning to book gigs and urging us to rehearse.

16:44.480 --> 16:47.920
The problem is, I am not particularly musically inclined,

16:48.640 --> 16:51.280
and I don't have that kind of time to devote to a band.

16:52.560 --> 16:55.920
How do I get out of this band without looking like an asshole?

16:56.640 --> 17:03.360
Sincerely, Pete Best from 60 years ago. What? No, it's bamboozled in Baltimore.

17:04.480 --> 17:08.880
There are so many parts of this question that confused the shit out of me.

17:08.880 --> 17:13.440
Yeah. Can I say mine and see if it's the same as yours?

17:16.800 --> 17:22.960
If you are not musically inclined, how did you get into this band in the first place?

17:22.960 --> 17:25.760
Derek, you gotta be in the band. I don't play any music.

17:25.760 --> 17:29.120
You got your spirit, your energy. We need it.

17:30.320 --> 17:36.000
This is the tricky thing about spirits, is there is a certain amount of alcohol

17:36.000 --> 17:39.200
that you can drink that when somebody asks you the question,

17:39.200 --> 17:44.000
hey, you play the drums, right? The answer becomes, yes, I do.

17:45.120 --> 17:47.760
Hand me those good skin sticks.

17:48.480 --> 17:53.600
I also am confused in this question that your friend has begun to book gigs.

17:54.240 --> 17:58.960
You haven't rehearsed at all. Your friend has put the cart

17:58.960 --> 18:01.360
so far in the front of the horse, the horse can't see it.

18:01.920 --> 18:04.000
The horse is not aware that there is a cart.

18:04.000 --> 18:08.480
Yeah, and the horse does not know how to play the bass as well as the horse maybe said they did

18:08.480 --> 18:10.560
when they had too much of that boons farm.

18:12.240 --> 18:17.120
Now, how do you get out of the band? Justin was joking earlier, but you kinda can't

18:17.120 --> 18:22.160
because you never know what is gonna be the new Beatles.

18:22.160 --> 18:24.720
Me and my friends were just gonna play a little skiffle.

18:24.720 --> 18:27.920
You don't know. You could be skiffling one day

18:27.920 --> 18:32.480
and then hard days knighting the next day. And you can't destroy this thing

18:32.480 --> 18:34.480
before it has a chance to get off the ground.

18:34.480 --> 18:37.840
I feel like this might be a self-correcting issue.

18:37.840 --> 18:40.880
Like, show up to the first rehearsal, sit down with your bass,

18:40.880 --> 18:42.880
and you're like, boing, boing, boing, boing, boing, boing.

18:42.880 --> 18:46.640
And they're like, okay, we're good here. All right, yeah, you're fine, bye-bye.

18:46.640 --> 18:49.440
All right, guys, let's just see what this old dog can do.

18:52.400 --> 18:57.600
Okay, we can't do this. We can't make this.

18:58.400 --> 19:01.680
We have this space for three hours, though. Do you guys wanna, I don't know,

19:01.680 --> 19:02.480
get some pizza?

19:03.360 --> 19:06.880
Is it possible that this is a Mighty Mighty Boston situation

19:06.880 --> 19:10.800
and this person was recruited just to like the dancing guy

19:10.800 --> 19:16.160
in Mighty Mighty Boston, just like a hype man to get the party rockin'?

19:16.160 --> 19:18.560
Who's the Umbrella Man? You know the Umbrella Man?

19:19.120 --> 19:20.160
From OutKast?

19:20.160 --> 19:20.400
Yes.

19:21.600 --> 19:24.640
Yeah, OutKast was originally like, hey, we're putting a band together,

19:24.640 --> 19:29.600
and Umbrella Man was like, I can play the trumpet.

19:29.600 --> 19:30.960
And they were like, all right, let's get in there.

19:30.960 --> 19:33.760
And then he couldn't, and so they just handed him an umbrella instead.

19:34.320 --> 19:35.520
Fonzworth Bentley.

19:35.520 --> 19:37.920
Thank you. Oh, that was gonna eat me up.

19:37.920 --> 19:45.440
Yeah. Ben Carr was the name of the dancing guy in the Mighty Mighty Boston.

19:45.440 --> 19:50.400
Now, if that name seems familiar to you, it's because he also used to work at Harmonix.

19:51.280 --> 19:52.960
Holy shit, that was him?

19:52.960 --> 19:53.520
What, really?

19:54.080 --> 19:54.880
Dig it.

19:54.880 --> 20:01.600
Maybe, maybe what your friend needs in this band is a dynamic front person.

20:01.600 --> 20:03.680
This is a thing that's gone out the window.

20:03.680 --> 20:09.440
You're Diamond Dave's, like you just don't see it as much anymore.

20:10.000 --> 20:10.960
Now, here's the thing.

20:10.960 --> 20:14.560
I will also say David Lee Roth is also a pretty good singer,

20:14.560 --> 20:18.480
so if you don't have that going for you, you're already at a bit of a disadvantage.

20:18.480 --> 20:22.160
But if you can really bring the energy,

20:22.160 --> 20:27.520
if you're really like, you might not be able to sing like Freddie Mercury,

20:27.520 --> 20:31.360
but if you can just ooze charisma like Freddie Mercury,

20:31.360 --> 20:34.960
you might be able to make it through a couple gigs.

20:34.960 --> 20:38.480
Hey, do you ooze sex?

20:39.120 --> 20:41.200
Because if so, you might have a place in this band.

20:41.200 --> 20:43.600
You can't play, you have no musical, and that's fine.

20:43.600 --> 20:46.560
Can you ooze sex?

20:46.560 --> 20:51.920
What, are you gonna play you at a mic that's not plugged in, and you just ooze?

20:51.920 --> 20:53.840
You just ungellate.

20:54.480 --> 20:56.160
Or, can I hit you with this?

20:56.160 --> 20:57.200
Maybe you'll learn.

20:57.200 --> 21:02.320
Maybe you get in there, and day one, it's goon, gah-gah, goon-goon,

21:02.320 --> 21:03.600
which the drum does what?

21:03.600 --> 21:07.360
And then by day two, it's, you know, goon, gah-gah, gah-gah, goon, gah-gah.

21:07.360 --> 21:11.200
Just like, maybe there's people who just, they pick it up,

21:11.200 --> 21:15.680
and then like the little boy in Love Actually,

21:16.720 --> 21:21.520
they're going Buddy Rich on that shit in like a week.

21:21.520 --> 21:24.320
Just a lot of does-de-gooshes and a lot of paradiddles.

21:24.320 --> 21:26.720
You just gotta get J.K. Simmons to come in and yell at you.

21:27.920 --> 21:30.080
Or Liam Neeson to come in and talk to you like,

21:30.080 --> 21:31.520
it's okay to be sad about your mom.

21:31.520 --> 21:32.960
Oh, have both.

21:32.960 --> 21:38.320
Have Liam Neeson come in to bring you down, and then like, J.K. to bring you up.

21:38.320 --> 21:39.840
Monday, Wednesday, Friday, you get Neeson.

21:40.400 --> 21:42.960
Tuesdays, Thursdays, and either Saturday or Sunday,

21:42.960 --> 21:44.640
he likes to keep his weekends kind of flexible.

21:44.640 --> 21:45.600
You get J.K. Simmons.

21:45.600 --> 21:46.880
It's like, what did Liam say?

21:46.880 --> 21:48.240
Well, the opposite of that.

21:48.240 --> 21:52.560
It's sort of like, it's like searching for Bobby Fischer,

21:52.560 --> 21:57.440
and one is your Bing Kingsley, and the other is your Joe Mantegna, I guess.

21:58.880 --> 22:00.560
Harry Connick Jr. is in there too somewhere.

22:01.520 --> 22:03.040
Harry shows up on Sunday.

22:03.040 --> 22:06.240
You get J.K. Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday.

22:06.240 --> 22:08.720
You get Liam, Monday, Wednesday, Friday,

22:08.720 --> 22:10.720
and then Harry Connick Jr. comes in on Sunday,

22:10.720 --> 22:14.960
and you guys just like smoke some whiskey and talk about, I don't know, love, whatever.

22:14.960 --> 22:21.600
Harry Connick Jr.'s role in searching for Bobby Fischer is every three minutes or so,

22:21.600 --> 22:23.680
he pops his head up from the corner of the screen.

22:23.680 --> 22:24.960
No one's quite sure where he's from.

22:24.960 --> 22:30.160
He says, hey, kid, chess is pretty cool, but have you tried the panano?

22:34.160 --> 22:35.280
The kid's like, what?

22:35.280 --> 22:37.760
I'm pretty sure it's piano.

22:37.760 --> 22:38.720
Not when I do it.

22:39.280 --> 22:40.080
Not when I do it.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.240
He would be the all-time best musician.

22:44.240 --> 22:45.520
Have you guys ever seen that video?

22:46.480 --> 22:47.600
Sorry, real quick.

22:48.320 --> 22:51.600
I just looked up the searching for Bobby Fischer IMDb page,

22:51.600 --> 22:56.000
because I couldn't remember Joe Mantegna's name in the moment.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.600
And there's a user list.

22:57.600 --> 22:59.920
You know, IMDb has the user list.

23:00.560 --> 23:01.760
Somebody has a list.

23:02.640 --> 23:08.240
It's 41 movies long, and it's Sidney Pollock movies I haven't seen but want to.

23:10.800 --> 23:13.360
41 fucking movies.

23:13.360 --> 23:15.600
I'm a huge fan, except...

23:16.720 --> 23:17.920
Can I give you this Yahoo?

23:17.920 --> 23:19.200
Is it about Harry Connick Jr.?

23:19.840 --> 23:20.240
It is.

23:20.240 --> 23:21.600
It's from Harry Connick Jr.

23:21.600 --> 23:23.600
And it's asked by Harry Connick Jr.

23:23.600 --> 23:27.360
And no, it's from Level 9000 Yajujuju Davenport.

23:27.360 --> 23:28.480
And thank you, Drew.

23:28.480 --> 23:29.840
It's Harry Connick Jr.

23:30.800 --> 23:31.760
Harry Connick Jr.

23:33.280 --> 23:34.000
New nickname.

23:34.000 --> 23:34.640
New nickname.

23:34.640 --> 23:35.520
I'll get rid of it.

23:35.520 --> 23:36.960
Sorry, no more shaman.

23:36.960 --> 23:38.320
He's Harry Connick Jr.

23:39.920 --> 23:40.880
It's really hard to say.

23:41.440 --> 23:42.480
It's really tough.

23:42.480 --> 23:46.640
It's by Drew and Your Answers user Michael who asks,

23:47.760 --> 23:50.320
will this make me look like a douche or something?

23:52.880 --> 23:56.320
I've been away from work for two weeks, and I'm coming back on Monday.

23:56.320 --> 24:00.560
I know my coworkers needed me while I was gone, and I know, not for sure.

24:01.200 --> 24:02.240
They missed me.

24:02.240 --> 24:03.200
So you don't know.

24:04.000 --> 24:09.280
My workplace is just a neighborhood bookstore, so there are like only 10 employees.

24:09.280 --> 24:14.320
I thought it would be cool to make a nice return entrance and come in with some awesome music,

24:14.320 --> 24:17.600
like the beginning of Crazy in Love or something in that style.

24:17.600 --> 24:23.600
My fear is that I might look like a huge douche while doing that without even meaning or noticing it.

24:23.600 --> 24:24.400
Whoa, hold on.

24:25.040 --> 24:28.320
You can't say without even meaning to at that point.

24:28.320 --> 24:30.000
Yeah, so what do you think?

24:30.000 --> 24:33.120
Is it a cool thing to do or extremely douchey?

24:33.120 --> 24:38.160
Oh, first of all, can I ask this question of you boys?

24:38.160 --> 24:39.360
Mm-hmm.

24:39.360 --> 24:46.720
What do you think this question asker thinks was going on in their absence that they were like,

24:46.720 --> 24:51.440
I know they needed me at this neighborhood bookstore of 10 employees.

24:51.440 --> 24:54.000
Without me, the whole place was falling apart.

24:54.000 --> 24:56.320
Yeah, the fucking store owner like kicks in the door like,

24:56.320 --> 24:58.880
guys, guys, guys, books two.

24:58.880 --> 25:01.680
This is a sequel to books, and we're not ready for it.

25:01.680 --> 25:04.240
And everybody scrambled to like stock the shelves with books too.

25:08.400 --> 25:10.640
It's such a fine line, isn't it?

25:10.640 --> 25:15.680
It's such a, ostentatious gestures.

25:15.680 --> 25:21.120
There's such a fine line between douchey and thrilling.

25:22.240 --> 25:27.360
I think your own personal charisma is the X factor that makes this really hard to dictate, right?

25:28.400 --> 25:29.760
Could you sell this?

25:29.760 --> 25:30.880
Harry Connick could.

25:30.880 --> 25:32.320
Harry Connick Jr. could sell this.

25:32.320 --> 25:33.120
Yeah, absolutely.

25:33.120 --> 25:33.840
For sure.

25:33.840 --> 25:35.280
Do you have his charisma?

25:35.280 --> 25:35.920
Let me help.

25:35.920 --> 25:36.400
You don't.

25:37.440 --> 25:39.840
But are you close enough to pull it off?

25:39.840 --> 25:40.320
I don't know.

25:40.880 --> 25:44.640
One of these users says, it will be cool if you use the right song,

25:44.640 --> 25:48.720
play the Superman theme song and hire out a Superman suit and some cabling,

25:48.720 --> 25:51.840
then fly into the store to save them all from your bookstore.

25:51.840 --> 25:53.920
Wait, okay, a few problems.

25:53.920 --> 25:57.200
What kind of fucking rigging system do you think this neighborhood bookstore has?

25:57.200 --> 25:58.640
Some cabling.

25:58.640 --> 26:01.920
That's a pretty big, that's a lot of jumps you're making there.

26:01.920 --> 26:05.360
We're gonna have to cut out the window above the door so I can get in.

26:05.360 --> 26:06.960
The problem is it's a bookstore.

26:06.960 --> 26:11.600
So I think coming in with a boombox is not very cool.

26:11.600 --> 26:13.760
What if you came in with a boombox?

26:13.760 --> 26:15.200
Okay, here's the move.

26:15.200 --> 26:19.680
Come with a boombox, just blaring crazy in love, except it's very quiet.

26:19.680 --> 26:25.920
It's like at a tasteful volume, but your gestures and just your various gesticulations

26:25.920 --> 26:30.560
are sort of our max, I like the max level.

26:30.560 --> 26:32.000
The door opens and you just hear like,

26:35.680 --> 26:36.880
but you're just flailing wildly.

26:36.880 --> 26:38.640
But you're flailing wildly.

26:38.640 --> 26:39.200
I got an idea.

26:39.200 --> 26:41.920
You're coming back and you want people to be excited about you coming back, right?

26:42.560 --> 26:47.040
You could bring some like brownies or something that's good for me.

26:47.040 --> 26:48.080
You know what I mean?

26:48.080 --> 26:52.480
Your dance number, it was very cool, but you know what's even cooler?

26:52.480 --> 26:54.240
A billion cookies.

26:54.240 --> 26:55.760
Let me, okay, Griffin.

26:55.760 --> 26:56.320
Counterpoint.

26:56.880 --> 26:59.440
And let me wrap this all into a big bow.

26:59.440 --> 27:00.320
Are you ready for this?

27:00.320 --> 27:02.400
Well, I still want to play in the space.

27:02.400 --> 27:03.920
Don't close off the space traps.

27:03.920 --> 27:04.880
I still want to play in here.

27:04.880 --> 27:07.280
When I pitch my idea, you let me know if I've solved it or not.

27:08.000 --> 27:14.800
You are going to need to hire a string quartet and an opera singer to do final countdown.

27:16.240 --> 27:18.160
I don't know that this is going to be it.

27:18.160 --> 27:21.120
No, because postmodern jukebox is very popular right now.

27:21.120 --> 27:24.240
People are really into these like you take a song, you turn it.

27:24.240 --> 27:25.600
And this is a bookstore, right?

27:25.600 --> 27:28.720
So they have to like, you know, book some nerdy shit.

27:28.720 --> 27:32.080
So like you're going to bring in a string quartet and like they're going to come in

27:32.080 --> 27:35.680
one by one, playing one by one, and it's going to build.

27:35.680 --> 27:39.600
And the opera singer comes in for like, it's the final countdown.

27:39.600 --> 27:43.520
And then you come in and maybe there's also like a caricature artist.

27:43.520 --> 27:45.120
I don't know, you know, classy shit.

27:45.120 --> 27:50.560
Okay, but well, it's been two weeks.

27:52.400 --> 27:54.560
It's a factor we haven't really dove into yet.

27:54.560 --> 27:54.880
Yeah.

27:54.880 --> 27:59.840
Well, when I was working at the country's best yogurt, and I like to think that we were

27:59.840 --> 28:02.000
the country's best, the country's best yogurt.

28:03.040 --> 28:03.840
We were all sort of-

28:03.840 --> 28:05.040
TCB, TCBY.

28:05.040 --> 28:06.880
Yeah, we were all putting in extra hours.

28:08.960 --> 28:16.080
And my coworker, Mark, left to go with his family to the Smokies for two weeks.

28:16.880 --> 28:20.640
And then he comes back with a choreographed dance number.

28:20.640 --> 28:25.840
I think I would probably be just kind of angry at Mark in that moment, because I haven't

28:25.840 --> 28:26.400
missed you.

28:26.400 --> 28:29.520
I haven't missed you that much, Mark.

28:29.520 --> 28:31.760
I don't know that you've earned this, Mark.

28:31.760 --> 28:37.920
The ultimate version of this is Mark comes back after six months of not being there,

28:37.920 --> 28:41.280
and he comes in to a string quartet playing final countdown.

28:41.280 --> 28:42.880
And you're like, Mark, what the fuck?

28:42.880 --> 28:43.520
Where you been?

28:43.520 --> 28:46.800
And he's like, I got fired for stealing money.

28:46.800 --> 28:50.640
Holy shit, Mark.

28:50.640 --> 28:53.200
Yeah, I spent all of it on this string quartet.

28:54.480 --> 28:58.240
Legally, I'm not supposed to be within a hundred yards of this building.

28:58.240 --> 29:00.400
It's the final countdown.

29:03.120 --> 29:09.360
Could you hide in a closet in a sleeping bag, and then when they arrive for work, they open

29:09.360 --> 29:13.200
it up and you sort of tumble out and try to sell them on the fact that you've been living

29:13.200 --> 29:13.840
there.

29:13.840 --> 29:14.640
Oh, that's fine.

29:14.640 --> 29:18.640
That's where you've been is you had some hard times and you've lived in the bookstore.

29:19.760 --> 29:22.720
I mean, you can have a lot of fun with that, too, because you could get in the crawl space

29:22.720 --> 29:28.240
and just sort of yell at them and say that the bookstore did consume you in some way,

29:28.240 --> 29:29.920
like it consumed your spirit.

29:29.920 --> 29:32.320
The bookstore and I have become one.

29:32.320 --> 29:33.840
Yeah, I am the bookstore.

29:33.840 --> 29:34.480
Dust me.

29:34.480 --> 29:35.600
Dust my walls.

29:36.480 --> 29:37.440
Don't sell that book.

29:37.440 --> 29:38.400
That's my kidney.

29:38.400 --> 29:44.800
I wasn't done reading that one.

29:45.520 --> 29:50.960
And then like your entrance back is you just smash through the fucking drywall and are

29:50.960 --> 29:53.840
birthed from the house womb, and there you are in your back.

29:53.840 --> 29:58.160
You have written every word of Jane Eyre on you, and you're like, I'm free.

29:59.600 --> 30:02.320
And that is what House of Leaves is about, in case you're curious.

30:02.320 --> 30:02.640
That is.

30:02.640 --> 30:03.440
That's the plot.

30:03.440 --> 30:04.480
Don't worry about it.

30:04.480 --> 30:05.360
There's a bunch of stuff.

30:05.360 --> 30:07.600
You got to like turn the book upside down at some point.

30:07.600 --> 30:08.320
Don't even worry.

30:08.320 --> 30:08.800
Don't worry about it.

30:08.800 --> 30:09.920
We got you covered.

30:09.920 --> 30:10.400
All right.

30:10.400 --> 30:12.400
We need to take a quick detour.

30:12.400 --> 30:14.240
Let's stop in to the money store.

30:25.280 --> 30:26.560
Hey, I want to tell you all about Harry's.

30:27.120 --> 30:28.640
You all know about Harry's, right?

30:28.640 --> 30:28.880
Yeah.

30:29.680 --> 30:33.280
They do the shaving stuff, but they do it like better than anybody.

30:33.280 --> 30:41.440
Basically, instead of having to like go to the store and spend $100,000 on like four

30:41.440 --> 30:47.200
razors or whatever, because razors are really stupid expensive, Harry's will just sell their

30:47.200 --> 30:51.680
razors direct to you, and in doing so, by cutting out the middleman, they can offer

30:51.680 --> 30:57.680
their blades at, well, it says here half the price, but that sounds like $50,000.

30:57.680 --> 30:58.480
That's not true.

30:58.480 --> 31:03.600
For just $2 a blade compared to four or more that you'll spend at the drug store, this

31:03.600 --> 31:06.720
is what you can get a Harry's razor for, and they are so confident.

31:06.720 --> 31:07.680
You'll love their blades.

31:07.680 --> 31:12.160
They are willing to send you a free trial set if you just cover three bucks shipping.

31:12.160 --> 31:18.000
That set includes a weighted ergonomic razor handle, a five precision engineered blades

31:18.000 --> 31:24.080
with a lubricating strip and trimmer blade, a rich lathering shave gel, and a little

31:24.080 --> 31:25.440
travel blade cover.

31:25.440 --> 31:27.280
That's a $13 a blade.

31:27.280 --> 31:30.160
That's a $13 value for you to try out.

31:30.960 --> 31:34.960
So stop messing around and get started shaving with Harry's today by claiming your free trial

31:34.960 --> 31:38.160
offer, $13 value for free, just cover shipping.

31:38.160 --> 31:41.760
To get that free trial, including a razor handle, five blade cartridge, and shave gel,

31:41.760 --> 31:44.320
go to harrys.com slash my brother right now.

31:44.320 --> 31:47.040
That's harrys.com slash my brother.

31:47.040 --> 31:48.240
Let me ask you guys a question.

31:48.800 --> 31:49.440
Okay.

31:49.440 --> 31:50.720
Do you know flowers?

31:51.600 --> 31:52.400
I don't.

31:52.400 --> 31:52.640
I'm sorry.

31:52.640 --> 31:58.240
Those are like fruit, but you can't...

31:58.240 --> 32:05.280
They're like trees, but they're little and not wood, and they have a lot of color too.

32:05.280 --> 32:11.120
Trees are like green and brown always, but these little trees or fruit, I'm not 100%

32:11.120 --> 32:14.560
sure, have many colors, including red.

32:15.440 --> 32:15.940
Sure.

32:16.720 --> 32:18.480
Well, here's the thing.

32:18.480 --> 32:20.320
Hey, everybody gather around.

32:20.320 --> 32:21.200
Getting close.

32:21.200 --> 32:26.960
Mother's Day is coming up, and it's your chance to show a little bit of appreciation to all

32:26.960 --> 32:28.000
the moms in your life.

32:28.720 --> 32:29.600
All of them.

32:30.880 --> 32:33.360
And how you're going to do that is through ProFlowers.

32:33.360 --> 32:35.040
ProFlowers we've worked with before.

32:35.760 --> 32:36.800
We're big fans.

32:36.800 --> 32:40.960
They're great anytime gifts, but they're even better gifts for special occasions.

32:40.960 --> 32:46.480
And right now you can get the 100 blooms for mom bouquet from ProFlowers this Mother's Day

32:46.480 --> 32:48.080
and make a real impression.

32:48.080 --> 32:52.320
And they sent us one of these bouquets, and they are beautiful.

32:52.320 --> 32:57.760
And what they do, and I love this, they send them to you just before they're about to bloom.

32:57.760 --> 33:02.960
So that way they last even longer, and you get to experience the fireworks of,

33:02.960 --> 33:07.600
oh, I went to sleep, and they were just little buds, and I woke up, and they were beautiful

33:07.600 --> 33:08.400
flowers.

33:08.400 --> 33:10.720
And it comes with a free glass vase for just $19.99.

33:10.720 --> 33:13.440
Beautiful, delicious flowers.

33:13.440 --> 33:14.800
No, Griffin, no.

33:14.800 --> 33:16.880
Crunchy, sweet.

33:16.880 --> 33:18.240
I mean, you don't eat all of them.

33:18.240 --> 33:18.880
No, no, no, no.

33:18.880 --> 33:22.800
You don't eat all of them all at once, because you do want to enjoy the visual bouquet.

33:22.800 --> 33:25.200
I mean, the literal bouquet of flowers.

33:25.200 --> 33:28.320
But I mean, Travis, hold on, hold on, hold on.

33:28.320 --> 33:28.880
Stop that.

33:30.000 --> 33:31.680
You're snacking on these things, right?

33:31.680 --> 33:38.320
No, I paid $10 to get the gourmet chocolates that come and the upgraded premium phase.

33:38.320 --> 33:43.920
It's like a side, that's like a companion food to these delicious, incredible blooms

33:43.920 --> 33:49.120
that just have this umami flavor to them that I don't quite, I can't live without it.

33:49.120 --> 33:51.680
Please don't tell our listeners to eat the flowers, Griffin.

33:51.680 --> 33:55.200
I'm not telling you to eat the flowers.

33:55.200 --> 33:58.160
I'm saying you can eat the flowers, and they're fucking delicious.

33:58.160 --> 34:00.640
No, please don't.

34:00.640 --> 34:04.000
I like to crack open one of these blooms, kind of spread the petals apart, and I put

34:04.000 --> 34:07.440
a little bit of Cheez Whiz in there, and all of a sudden, I've got some very floral combos.

34:07.440 --> 34:09.200
This is a good, this is good.

34:09.200 --> 34:09.840
No, it's good.

34:09.840 --> 34:13.680
Griffin's going to be able to scientifically prove whether or not these flowers are edible,

34:13.680 --> 34:17.520
because we'll put this episode out, and then we'll wait to see if we get an email

34:17.520 --> 34:22.000
from ProFlowers with the subject line, warning, highly poisonous flowers.

34:22.000 --> 34:23.200
No, it's a flower.

34:23.200 --> 34:24.320
Please pull episode.

34:25.040 --> 34:26.720
Goats do it.

34:26.720 --> 34:28.000
Bees do it.

34:29.360 --> 34:32.000
Even certain types, trees do it.

34:32.000 --> 34:33.440
Eat these flowers.

34:33.440 --> 34:40.880
They are so, so crunchy and delicious and sweet, and they are, every bloom is honey glazed.

34:40.880 --> 34:44.480
They got different flavors, too.

34:44.480 --> 34:46.560
No, they're not skittles.

34:46.560 --> 34:47.920
Please don't eat these flowers.

34:47.920 --> 34:49.200
We love you.

34:49.200 --> 34:55.360
They asked me what flowers they wanted me to have, and so I said I would love the nacho

34:55.360 --> 34:59.840
cheesier tulips, and they did, and they are cheesier than nachos.

34:59.840 --> 35:03.600
They are, and there's no saturated fat, which is so important these days.

35:04.880 --> 35:10.640
If you want to get 100 blooms from mom with a free glass vase that is not edible,

35:10.640 --> 35:15.520
starting at $19.99, go to proflowers.com, and then you click on the little microphone

35:15.520 --> 35:21.360
in the top right corner and use the code MYBROTHER, proflowers.com, click the microphone,

35:21.360 --> 35:22.960
and then use the code MYBROTHER.

35:22.960 --> 35:23.920
All one word.

35:23.920 --> 35:29.120
All one word, and this sells out fast, so order it today.

35:29.680 --> 35:31.040
I'll tell you the problem, though.

35:31.040 --> 35:32.720
Get breakfast.

35:32.720 --> 35:40.960
The problem is I got a bouquet of cooler ranch roses, and I was just pounding them, and I

35:40.960 --> 35:45.760
realized there was only one left, and now when all the delicious flavored blasted petals

35:45.760 --> 35:49.440
fall off of that one, I'm going to turn back into the beast or whatever.

35:50.800 --> 35:52.160
Do you guys want this Jumbotron?

35:52.160 --> 35:52.640
Too bad.

35:52.640 --> 35:53.600
It's from Nick...

35:53.600 --> 35:54.400
Nope.

35:54.400 --> 35:58.720
It's from Leia Burns, and it's for Nick Pittman, and Leia says,

35:58.720 --> 36:00.320
Happy 25th birthday, Nick.

36:00.320 --> 36:04.080
Thanks for being the best partner ever and for getting me into my bim bam, even though

36:04.080 --> 36:09.680
it meant me listening to the entire back catalog and trying to get you to do the same by referencing

36:09.680 --> 36:11.520
goofs that you don't even get.

36:11.520 --> 36:15.760
I can't imagine a better person to go through life with, and I'm so lucky to have you.

36:15.760 --> 36:17.680
I love you, and I like you.

36:18.960 --> 36:22.880
This is a very sweet message and a very sweet thing that you've done for each other and for

36:22.880 --> 36:27.440
us, and yeah, we just appreciate you so much.

36:27.440 --> 36:30.800
Your birthday's May 7th, so we really split the uprights.

36:30.800 --> 36:35.600
Well, Leia split the uprights, I think, but yeah, happy birthday.

36:36.880 --> 36:38.480
I would like Justin to read this next one.

36:40.080 --> 36:40.580
Okay.

36:41.680 --> 36:47.280
This is a message for Amelie, and it's from Maddie M, and the message is this.

36:47.280 --> 36:49.280
Happy birthday, you big dumb idiot.

36:49.280 --> 36:51.200
Oh, man.

36:51.200 --> 36:51.600
Hold on.

36:51.600 --> 36:54.880
Wait, Justin, say that in the Amelie voice, and I think maybe that will soften the blow.

36:54.880 --> 36:58.880
No, I don't want to ruin Amelie by making her mean.

36:58.880 --> 37:00.080
Well, this is dark Amelie.

37:00.080 --> 37:03.680
This is like Amelie with a goatee and an eye patch.

37:03.680 --> 37:04.960
I'm not a fucking monkey.

37:05.840 --> 37:07.840
I'm not a fucking professional.

37:07.840 --> 37:09.680
Charles Darwin would say otherwise.

37:09.680 --> 37:10.320
Happy birthday.

37:10.320 --> 37:13.040
Whoa, whoa, whoa, got a little heady.

37:13.040 --> 37:16.480
Some fucking highbrow humor.

37:16.480 --> 37:20.720
Well, we took a fucking hard pivot into Didis Millertown, huh?

37:20.720 --> 37:24.880
Like a lot of real good references.

37:24.880 --> 37:28.000
You've been a top tier homie since day two of college.

37:28.880 --> 37:33.360
I don't know what happened day one, but since day two of college, pretty chill.

37:33.360 --> 37:35.200
Day one, you were kind of a ding-a-ling.

37:35.200 --> 37:36.880
Little bit of a dick.

37:36.880 --> 37:37.440
Pretty chill.

37:37.440 --> 37:39.280
We've kept it up for seven years now.

37:39.280 --> 37:43.840
Even though you name your fucking human rogue child Kevin James, you're the best,

37:44.480 --> 37:47.120
and I just spent all my money on this, so you owe me drinks.

37:48.560 --> 37:49.840
That's a lot of drinks.

37:49.840 --> 37:53.040
One Jumbotron equals several drinks.

37:53.040 --> 37:56.240
Several drinks, or one very big one.

37:56.880 --> 37:58.640
One very big, very good drink.

38:00.240 --> 38:01.840
Hey, MaxFun community.

38:01.840 --> 38:06.480
This is your friend Elizabeth Gilbert, author of You Pray Love and a bunch of other stuff.

38:06.480 --> 38:11.760
I am a longtime member, supporter, and devoted follower of Maximum Fun,

38:11.760 --> 38:13.920
and now finally I have my own podcast on the network.

38:13.920 --> 38:19.520
It's called Magic Lessons, and it is me coaching people through their creative issues and problems.

38:19.520 --> 38:24.000
This season, we have some amazing creators that were helping through their joys and struggles

38:24.000 --> 38:25.600
of making something out of nothing.

38:25.600 --> 38:30.080
And then I bring in special guests like Glennon Doyle Melton, Brandon Stanton, Martha Beck,

38:30.080 --> 38:35.040
the poet Mark Nepo, Michael Ian Black, Sarah Jones, Gary Scheingart, these amazing friends

38:35.040 --> 38:38.400
of mine to come and help coach these people so that they can get their work done.

38:38.400 --> 38:39.440
I hope you'll tune into it.

38:39.440 --> 38:42.960
It's called Magic Lessons, and it's all about love.

38:42.960 --> 38:53.600
Uh, we have a special treat now, um, and it is a, a discussion with, uh, a, a guestpert,

38:54.240 --> 38:57.440
uh, named, well, you'll see, I guess we say it in the segment, right?

38:57.440 --> 39:01.360
We say it in the segment and several times just when we address the person.

39:01.360 --> 39:04.000
I, I am going to apologize for the quality of it.

39:04.000 --> 39:05.360
Probably won't be so good.

39:05.360 --> 39:09.440
We kind of had to drop back and, uh, plant with how we recorded the call.

39:09.440 --> 39:13.360
Um, but it's good stuff and I think y'all are going to like it.

39:13.360 --> 39:14.400
So here is that.

39:14.400 --> 39:21.520
Today's guestpert is, uh, a TV star who is so excited to be finally getting his big break

39:21.520 --> 39:31.600
in podcasting from Hidden America and the new Mystery Science Theater 3000, which isn't

39:31.600 --> 39:33.520
the title, but would be a very good name.

39:33.520 --> 39:34.640
It's Jonah Ray.

39:34.640 --> 39:35.280
Welcome to the program.

39:35.280 --> 39:38.240
The real Mystery Science Theater 3000.

39:38.240 --> 39:41.120
Yes, yeah.

39:41.120 --> 39:41.680
Hi Jonah.

39:42.320 --> 39:44.160
Hi, thanks for having me.

39:44.160 --> 39:45.280
I am very excited.

39:45.280 --> 39:48.800
This, this, this podcasting thing is out of this world.

39:48.800 --> 39:50.320
It really is a real trip.

39:50.320 --> 39:51.040
It's real funky.

39:52.240 --> 39:53.040
We'll hold your hand.

39:53.040 --> 39:53.920
We'll keep you safe.

39:53.920 --> 39:54.720
Don't worry.

39:54.720 --> 39:57.920
Now Jonah, unless I'm mistaken, I can kind of hear from your voice that you're doing

39:57.920 --> 40:03.920
a lot of fun faces and I do want to tell you that that is, it's, it's neither necessary

40:03.920 --> 40:04.560
nor appreciated.

40:04.560 --> 40:06.880
Yeah, this is a marathon, not a sprint.

40:06.880 --> 40:11.520
You need to save that face muscle energy for just raw audio production.

40:12.080 --> 40:15.760
I get, I get, I get your concerns, but I have no control over it.

40:15.760 --> 40:20.960
I do have a spasm and I, uh, ask that you not bring it up on this medium, uh, which

40:20.960 --> 40:26.560
is why I've done so well in the, uh, silhouetted, uh, entertainment world where you can't see

40:26.560 --> 40:27.060
my face.

40:27.920 --> 40:30.080
Now Jonah, how does that work?

40:30.080 --> 40:32.960
Yeah, you're really in a big theater.

40:32.960 --> 40:34.000
I've always wondered.

40:34.000 --> 40:35.520
Oh, golly.

40:35.520 --> 40:38.720
You know, movie magic is-

40:38.720 --> 40:41.120
Hey, but, but Jonah, how does it work?

40:41.120 --> 40:42.640
Yeah, but no, but really, I am kidding.

40:44.000 --> 40:47.840
You want, you want to know that like the thing, the thing that like I was most like, cause

40:47.840 --> 40:51.600
like, you know, watching, watching the show so much and like trying to find out all about

40:51.600 --> 40:55.760
it and how they made it, uh, like I knew they did like the silhouettes in front of a, uh,

40:55.760 --> 41:00.480
a green screen or a blue screen originally, but when, uh, we were, it was time to do ours,

41:00.480 --> 41:08.320
um, they, they, they put me in a, like a dark gray jumpsuit, um, and then the bots were

41:08.320 --> 41:11.120
painted, uh, completely like a matte black.

41:11.120 --> 41:13.360
That must be very, very, very upsetting.

41:14.080 --> 41:19.280
It just was like bizarro world, negative land, uh, Mr. Science Theater.

41:19.280 --> 41:21.440
And that was like a thing that I was like, oh yeah.

41:22.400 --> 41:26.400
That was probably the one thing that I was really shocked by noticing.

41:26.400 --> 41:31.360
Now Jonah, are the robots hard to work with cause they seem like they're always razzling.

41:31.360 --> 41:32.160
All right.

41:32.160 --> 41:32.400
Yeah.

41:32.400 --> 41:34.000
It seems like they're always giving you the business.

41:34.880 --> 41:37.040
They really are, but they are good friends of mine.

41:37.040 --> 41:38.560
They're true professionals.

41:38.560 --> 41:42.240
And it's the way we work is just, it's a lot of fun.

41:42.240 --> 41:45.360
I mean, you guys know what you do here on your radio show.

41:45.360 --> 41:49.840
Uh, it's just a good way to have fun and not take things too seriously.

41:49.840 --> 41:53.760
Hey, is, how, is, how am our superstar really fucking cool in person?

41:53.760 --> 41:56.800
Cause it seems like he'd be a really fucking cool guy.

41:56.800 --> 41:57.680
He's a really cool.

41:57.680 --> 42:02.320
I mean, I've known, I've known that guy for probably now like 14 years or 15 years.

42:02.880 --> 42:06.000
Uh, and he's a, he's an awesome, good dude.

42:06.000 --> 42:07.200
He's a good friend.

42:07.200 --> 42:10.400
Uh, he, uh, he actually was the wedding band at my, my wife's wedding.

42:10.400 --> 42:11.040
You're kidding me.

42:11.600 --> 42:12.640
God, I cannot imagine.

42:12.640 --> 42:14.080
That's a fucking cool wedding.

42:14.720 --> 42:14.960
Yeah.

42:14.960 --> 42:16.320
It was, it was a really fun wedding.

42:16.320 --> 42:20.240
We did it like at this place that was right on some train tracks and we timed the ceremony

42:20.240 --> 42:21.600
to be when trains were going by.

42:21.600 --> 42:26.560
And it was fun to like, look at the, uh, look at the audience, um, and to see who thought

42:26.560 --> 42:29.920
it was awesome and who thought it was a horrifying thing to happen during the wedding.

42:29.920 --> 42:36.560
Um, but, uh, and this is going to sound, uh, uh, real name droppy and I apologize if it

42:36.560 --> 42:41.280
does, but, um, when, when Harmar was playing, uh, they were like, they did a bunch of Harmar

42:41.280 --> 42:45.200
superstar songs and then they started playing like some like, you know, wedding, wedding

42:45.200 --> 42:50.160
kind of covers and they started playing, uh, power of love, uh, what they didn't know

42:50.160 --> 42:55.760
though, is that, uh, in attendance, uh, was Tom Wilson, the guy who played Biff.

42:55.760 --> 42:56.800
Holy shit.

42:56.800 --> 42:57.280
Oh no.

42:58.000 --> 43:02.320
And so like, and you know, Tom kind of like, he's like a really awesome guy, really great

43:02.320 --> 43:06.480
comic, a good actor, but he does, you know, there is a bit of a complex, not a complex,

43:06.480 --> 43:08.160
but like it's something he deals with.

43:08.160 --> 43:09.680
He did a song about it.

43:09.680 --> 43:12.720
I mean, he did a song about people asking him about Back to the Future.

43:13.200 --> 43:13.840
Yeah, exactly.

43:13.840 --> 43:15.040
Stop asking me these questions.

43:15.040 --> 43:20.160
But then, uh, so he was, uh, he was there and then they started playing the song and

43:20.160 --> 43:24.640
then I guess a couple of people around him were like, uh, Hey, get up there.

43:24.640 --> 43:25.600
Oh, that stinks.

43:25.600 --> 43:31.760
So, so he ran, but he ran up on stage and started singing the song along with, uh, Harmar

43:31.760 --> 43:33.120
who did not know he was there.

43:33.120 --> 43:35.120
It was blown away.

43:35.120 --> 43:36.320
Everyone started screaming.

43:36.320 --> 43:39.600
Everyone, uh, everyone like was really blown away.

43:39.600 --> 43:40.800
And then he, he left shortly after.

43:40.800 --> 43:44.160
I emailed him saying like, it's like, Hey, I'm sorry if you felt like they didn't know

43:44.160 --> 43:45.360
you were there.

43:45.360 --> 43:47.200
And he's like, Oh no, no, it's totally fine.

43:47.200 --> 43:48.480
I, I don't mind.

43:48.480 --> 43:52.880
But he said the worst part was when a friend of mine came up to him and, uh, he was drinking,

43:52.880 --> 43:57.440
uh, he was drinking a light beer and someone said, someone said light beer.

43:57.440 --> 44:01.600
Uh, like, like the reference, like to, you know, Oh, I bring your car all the way back

44:01.600 --> 44:03.280
here and all you got for me is light beer.

44:03.280 --> 44:07.360
And then Tom's response to that, Tom's response to that was, uh, come on, man, you're better

44:07.360 --> 44:08.240
than that.

44:08.240 --> 44:10.160
I didn't come, I didn't come to this wedding to work.

44:10.160 --> 44:10.560
Yeah.

44:10.560 --> 44:15.840
I do think though, he does have to stop drinking, I mean, he can't just drink a light beer in

44:15.840 --> 44:17.440
public and not expect, you know?

44:18.400 --> 44:18.640
Yeah.

44:18.640 --> 44:20.640
There's certain things you trade off for fame.

44:21.200 --> 44:26.800
Um, like if, like, like when, when Clint Eastwood's at the casino, he doesn't say like, I'm feeling

44:26.800 --> 44:29.360
lucky and everyone's like, Oh, go on.

44:31.200 --> 44:35.600
Hey, we, you're not here because of TV or because of jokes.

44:35.600 --> 44:37.280
You're here because you're an expert.

44:37.840 --> 44:38.800
I am.

44:38.800 --> 44:44.080
Jonah, and we're going to pick your proverbial brain, which is an excellent choice of, um,

44:45.360 --> 44:52.160
a phrase from me, a broadcasting professional, because I am, I'm gonna, uh, uh, we're gonna

44:52.160 --> 44:54.560
talk about zombies and some about comedy.

44:55.680 --> 44:57.840
We got many more, here's the thing.

44:57.840 --> 45:02.800
We got many more questions about zombies than we did about putting on comedy shows.

45:02.800 --> 45:06.800
Like many, many, many more, which is surprising to me because I thought like, I don't know,

45:06.800 --> 45:11.680
like a lot of people who listen to our show are like comedy folks, right?

45:11.680 --> 45:15.280
That do like actual, do like improv and stuff like that.

45:15.280 --> 45:19.440
But no, they're, I think they're more concerned about being devoured by a dead person.

45:20.080 --> 45:21.520
Well, do you think it's the bubble?

45:21.520 --> 45:23.600
Is it the, is the comedy bubble finally over?

45:23.600 --> 45:26.720
Is this like the first inkling that it's all going to go downhill for all of us?

45:26.720 --> 45:31.440
No, actually, Jonah, I think what it is is we might've forgotten to mention on the show,

45:32.240 --> 45:33.760
the comedy show aspect.

45:33.760 --> 45:36.320
That'll, that'll do it every time.

45:36.320 --> 45:39.760
And I think that might've had a pretty big impact.

45:39.760 --> 45:43.520
Um, but we did, uh, we did fail to mention in the, in your intro that,

45:43.520 --> 45:46.880
uh, along with MST3K and Hidden America,

45:46.880 --> 45:50.480
you also were one of the hosts of the Meltdown with Jonah and Kumail.

45:50.480 --> 45:51.360
Who was that?

45:51.360 --> 45:52.320
I played the role of Jonah.

45:52.320 --> 45:55.040
Yeah, I was going to say, who's the other host on that one?

45:55.040 --> 46:00.080
Well, I actually went, I went to one of the Meltdown live shows and Kumail was not in

46:00.080 --> 46:06.960
attendance and filling in his place was Judd Apatow, which made for, it was a very surreal

46:06.960 --> 46:08.160
experience for me.

46:09.360 --> 46:10.960
Wait, is that, what's the Meltdown?

46:10.960 --> 46:16.240
So the Meltdown was a, it's a, it was a comic book store that, uh, I started doing a show

46:16.240 --> 46:19.520
at like, you know, eight years ago or so.

46:19.520 --> 46:23.040
Um, and then when Kumail moved to town, I was doing it monthly.

46:23.040 --> 46:24.480
He wanted to try and figure out a weekly show.

46:24.480 --> 46:29.280
So we just kind of joined forces with his wife, Emily Gordon, and, uh, she started producing

46:29.280 --> 46:30.160
it and we started hosting it.

46:30.160 --> 46:34.080
So it was just a weekly comedy show that we did for a while that we ended up turning into

46:34.080 --> 46:35.840
three seasons of a show on Comedy Central.

46:35.840 --> 46:36.880
But it wasn't a podcast.

46:37.440 --> 46:38.560
It was never a podcast.

46:38.560 --> 46:39.200
Oh, thank God.

46:39.200 --> 46:40.080
Okay, good.

46:40.080 --> 46:42.320
Cause listen, it's crowded in here, Jonah.

46:42.320 --> 46:46.720
You gotta, my whole intro would have been so stupid if you had done a podcast before.

46:46.720 --> 46:47.920
So I'm really happy to hear.

46:50.880 --> 46:53.120
At home, that's, we call that doubling down.

46:55.440 --> 46:58.160
There's no backing out of this ill-fated bit now.

46:58.160 --> 47:00.240
Uh, will I return to it again?

47:00.240 --> 47:01.520
Well, we'll just have to see.

47:01.520 --> 47:06.960
But it's time, it's time to start really digging deep into these questions.

47:06.960 --> 47:08.640
And this is a very good one that I like.

47:08.640 --> 47:12.160
This is not the first one Travis has listed, but I'm going to leave with it because I

47:12.160 --> 47:12.720
think it's great.

47:13.360 --> 47:14.640
Jonah and McElroy brothers.

47:15.440 --> 47:22.160
How do you feel about people in zombie movies and shows who seem to have no concept of zombies?

47:22.160 --> 47:24.640
Y'all really so shocked to see undead folks?

47:24.640 --> 47:27.040
You've never even conceived of this before?

47:27.040 --> 47:29.440
There's no George Romero in your universe?

47:29.440 --> 47:30.000
Come on.

47:30.880 --> 47:33.120
How would you all handle it if you made a zombie flick?

47:33.120 --> 47:34.240
And that's from Jennifer.

47:35.760 --> 47:42.240
Well, Jennifer, uh, it is kind of brought up in a very clever way in Shaun of the Dead.

47:42.240 --> 47:43.360
It's the best.

47:43.360 --> 47:43.600
Yeah.

47:43.600 --> 47:47.200
Which is, uh, like it's, uh, Nick Frost's character says zombies.

47:47.200 --> 47:48.960
And then Shaun says, don't use that word.

47:49.760 --> 47:50.240
And that's it.

47:50.240 --> 47:51.600
Uh, and that's it.

47:51.600 --> 47:52.240
He's like, which word?

47:52.240 --> 47:53.040
The Zed word.

47:53.040 --> 47:54.720
You know, it's, uh, and he's like, why not?

47:54.720 --> 47:58.400
He's like, because it's crazy because that's the feeling people would have at imagine.

47:58.400 --> 48:03.920
It bothers me so much in Walking Dead, which is now like the biggest zombie thing fucking

48:03.920 --> 48:04.960
ever of all time.

48:04.960 --> 48:10.080
And probably always will be is there's this whole concept of just like, Oh no, here come,

48:10.640 --> 48:12.240
here come the flesh skeletons.

48:12.240 --> 48:13.520
Like, Oh, that's what you call them.

48:13.520 --> 48:14.480
We call them walkers.

48:14.480 --> 48:15.280
What do you call them?

48:15.280 --> 48:16.720
I call them shamblers.

48:16.720 --> 48:17.600
What do you call them?

48:17.600 --> 48:19.120
I call them stink meats.

48:19.120 --> 48:20.880
And it's like, there's zombies.

48:20.880 --> 48:22.880
You guys have seen these fucking films.

48:22.880 --> 48:26.800
Did you say one of them was sandlers as in Adam Sandler?

48:26.800 --> 48:31.840
I said shamblers, but I'm sure there's a group of people like, what's up?

48:31.840 --> 48:32.960
We're the nasty boys.

48:32.960 --> 48:34.240
We call them sandlers.

48:34.240 --> 48:38.000
Like why do you need your own club and not call them zombies?

48:38.000 --> 48:39.040
We're the spike Kings.

48:39.040 --> 48:40.320
We call them zo hands.

48:40.320 --> 48:41.680
Cause you don't want to mess with them.

48:45.200 --> 48:49.520
Um, I don't, I think I, like, I really think the Shaun of the dead model is the best way

48:49.520 --> 48:52.800
to, to, has there ever been a zombie movie where like, where they just

48:52.800 --> 48:54.240
just flat out, just call them zombies.

48:54.240 --> 48:55.440
And they call them zombies the whole time.

48:56.480 --> 48:58.480
Zombie land, zombie land did right zombie land.

48:58.480 --> 48:59.680
They just leaned into it.

49:00.560 --> 49:05.680
Um, I, I find, I feel this about any movie where it's like, it must be so hard when you're

49:05.680 --> 49:08.240
like the, the script writer for the movie.

49:08.240 --> 49:11.760
Like if you're doing a vampire movie and you know, somebody shows up and they're like,

49:11.760 --> 49:16.080
have a lot of eye makeup on and they're being really creepy, but someone's not like, Oh,

49:16.080 --> 49:17.360
that's the vampire.

49:17.360 --> 49:18.880
You guys know about vampires, right?

49:18.880 --> 49:19.120
Right.

49:19.120 --> 49:20.240
We all know about vampires.

49:20.240 --> 49:21.280
This is the vampire.

49:21.280 --> 49:23.440
They can't do that in other movies that the fucking upcoming.

49:24.000 --> 49:29.600
And I can't believe they're making up mummy reboot with Tom cruise is they're not like,

49:29.600 --> 49:31.360
Oh, here comes a bandage boy.

49:31.360 --> 49:33.440
Like, no, they know what fucking mommy's are.

49:35.280 --> 49:39.440
There's a, there's a, uh, a really funny thing, uh, Kumail once said, where he said,

49:39.440 --> 49:44.320
why isn't every movie with the rock, uh, every time he meets someone new for the first time,

49:44.320 --> 49:46.960
why isn't the first thing they say go, Whoa, you're huge.

49:46.960 --> 49:57.760
Oh, also in return of the living dead, uh, they, um, in the beginning, uh, they bring

49:57.760 --> 50:00.240
up the, uh, Romero night of the living dead.

50:00.240 --> 50:01.680
Like, it's like, they, they make allude.

50:01.680 --> 50:04.320
They allude to like, it's like, Oh no, that was based on real things.

50:05.200 --> 50:06.960
So what's covered up?

50:06.960 --> 50:09.520
What's the scariest that you think zombies have ever been?

50:09.520 --> 50:13.440
Like what's the scariest portrayal of zombies that I actually got, got to you?

50:13.440 --> 50:17.120
I mean, it's like, it's different because it's like, when I was a kid, I didn't know

50:17.120 --> 50:19.120
return to living dead was a comedy.

50:19.120 --> 50:23.840
I just thought it was frightening that the zombies could run faster than, you know, the

50:23.840 --> 50:28.560
ones in Dawn of the dead, the original Dawn of the dead, um, probably the original Dawn

50:28.560 --> 50:31.200
of the dead was the one that really made me the most scared.

50:32.640 --> 50:35.040
For me, it was resident, resident evil one.

50:35.040 --> 50:38.080
I know it doesn't technically count cause it's not a movie, but that shit literally

50:38.080 --> 50:40.240
gave me nightmares for five or six years straight.

50:40.240 --> 50:42.000
Resident evil five.

50:42.000 --> 50:46.320
Resident evil four gave me nightmares, but just like stress game nightmares.

50:46.320 --> 50:47.520
Yeah, right.

50:47.520 --> 50:48.480
Thriller.

50:48.480 --> 50:53.280
Thriller freaks me out when they, I was really young the first time I saw it when they came

50:53.280 --> 50:58.240
up through the floorboards, like the concept of like, well, just being inside your house

50:58.240 --> 51:00.560
doesn't make you safe was very scary for me.

51:01.360 --> 51:04.480
Hey, does the robot lady from Superman three count?

51:04.480 --> 51:07.280
Cause she gave me the yips in a major way.

51:07.280 --> 51:08.320
Why would she?

51:08.320 --> 51:12.080
She's like a mechanical zombie, right?

51:12.080 --> 51:13.600
That's a robot, Justin.

51:13.600 --> 51:16.320
I guess all robots are mechanical zombies in a way.

51:16.320 --> 51:19.200
I have a fucking, I have a fucking Roomba in my house.

51:19.200 --> 51:21.840
Is it, do I need to be afraid of this for you or?

51:21.840 --> 51:23.680
I don't, I don't want to do this anymore.

51:23.680 --> 51:27.040
Did it make it scary to make mystery science theater 3000 to know that you were working

51:27.040 --> 51:28.000
with robot zombies?

51:29.840 --> 51:31.680
I did have to bring them back from the brink.

51:31.680 --> 51:36.080
So yes, it was very scary the entire time, but luckily they only feast on other robot

51:36.080 --> 51:36.640
zombies.

51:36.640 --> 51:40.160
Jonah, I'm currently performing a comedic one man show in New York.

51:40.880 --> 51:41.840
Come on out everybody.

51:41.840 --> 51:43.920
It's going to be not me.

51:43.920 --> 51:44.640
What's it called?

51:44.640 --> 51:45.200
Oh shoot.

51:45.200 --> 51:45.920
I thought we could play.

51:45.920 --> 51:48.000
I thought we could play a little bit in the space.

51:48.000 --> 51:48.480
Sorry.

51:48.480 --> 51:49.920
Just in time.

51:49.920 --> 51:50.800
The show is called.

51:50.800 --> 51:51.920
Oh, I didn't see you all there.

51:52.560 --> 51:53.280
Oh, that's fun.

51:54.240 --> 51:56.080
How would you guys start your one man shows?

51:56.640 --> 51:59.120
What would be the first line is in the neighborhood?

51:59.120 --> 51:59.920
I grew up.

51:59.920 --> 52:01.920
There sure were a lot of characters.

52:01.920 --> 52:06.400
That's a good choice.

52:06.400 --> 52:07.760
Griffin, how would you start your?

52:08.400 --> 52:09.360
Well, it's tough.

52:09.360 --> 52:13.280
Mine would entirely be pantomime and just sort of movement.

52:14.160 --> 52:18.560
So it would sort of start with me like laying perfectly still on the stage and then doing

52:18.560 --> 52:23.600
what could only be described as human blossoming, which is dancing to the theme song from Blossom.

52:24.160 --> 52:25.280
That is the beginning is yeah.

52:27.680 --> 52:31.440
I would just start with like 700 Sundays.

52:31.440 --> 52:35.680
I couldn't believe that there were that many Sundays back to back to back.

52:35.680 --> 52:40.400
And then I would just recite Billy Crystal 700 Sundays verbatim.

52:40.400 --> 52:41.600
Just the fart bit, though.

52:41.600 --> 52:43.840
You would do an extended version of the fart bit, right?

52:45.840 --> 52:47.200
You mean City Slickers?

52:51.360 --> 52:53.200
Have you seen 700 Sundays?

52:53.200 --> 52:54.960
I've seen City Slickers.

52:54.960 --> 52:58.320
Well, 700 Sundays has a real long fart bit.

52:58.320 --> 53:02.640
Now, luckily for us, we don't actually have to know anything about things.

53:02.640 --> 53:04.400
Just randomly reference them.

53:04.400 --> 53:04.880
Thank God.

53:04.880 --> 53:06.640
I'm sure it's a delight.

53:06.640 --> 53:07.440
It's not.

53:07.440 --> 53:08.640
He's a consummate professional.

53:10.240 --> 53:14.400
Hey, Billy's a friend and a fan who I'm sure is listening right now, so please.

53:14.960 --> 53:20.000
OK, so the question is, it's a storytelling show about my bar mitzvah and struggles with

53:20.000 --> 53:21.120
mental health.

53:21.120 --> 53:23.760
What are some ways I can actually get butts in the seats?

53:23.760 --> 53:25.040
A publicist?

53:25.040 --> 53:26.160
Online ads?

53:26.160 --> 53:26.960
Skywriting?

53:26.960 --> 53:28.240
Thanks.

53:28.240 --> 53:29.840
And good work on the satellite of love.

53:29.840 --> 53:31.840
And that's from one man in Manhattan.

53:33.280 --> 53:34.080
Can I say something?

53:35.360 --> 53:37.040
I have to point out the very obvious.

53:38.160 --> 53:44.400
One good way would be to get a free mention on a fairly popular podcast and maybe just

53:45.120 --> 53:46.880
toss that name in there, huh?

53:46.880 --> 53:50.480
Just get that old name in.

53:51.760 --> 53:52.080
Yeah.

53:52.080 --> 53:58.800
So one man shows I know I've never done one really you want to make flies want to make

53:58.800 --> 54:03.840
physical flyers like if I the thing with like doing a comedy show is it's regularity and

54:03.840 --> 54:06.160
I'm sure you guys it's the same thing with podcasting.

54:06.160 --> 54:08.960
If you kind of stay on a schedule, it does help a lot.

54:08.960 --> 54:10.880
Just the consistency of it.

54:12.080 --> 54:17.760
But yeah, do it like I'd say and you know, Kurt Braunohler a few times has tried skywriting

54:17.760 --> 54:18.640
to promote stuff.

54:19.600 --> 54:20.640
It never really worked.

54:20.640 --> 54:24.880
It never really works as well as you think it would because everything starts to drift

54:24.880 --> 54:25.360
away.

54:25.360 --> 54:26.640
You know, chemtrails and whatnot.

54:27.280 --> 54:28.080
Sure, of course.

54:28.080 --> 54:29.520
No, tell us more about chemtrails.

54:29.520 --> 54:31.760
Let this be your your appearance.

54:31.760 --> 54:35.440
Your Ronda Rousey 9-11 truther appearance.

54:36.000 --> 54:40.160
I wish sometimes I knew more about conspiracy theories to be able to joke around about them.

54:40.160 --> 54:42.160
But as far like that's as much as I go.

54:42.720 --> 54:45.120
For chemtrails, I go, yeah, look at those chemtrails, man.

54:45.120 --> 54:46.960
Boran controlling your mind.

54:46.960 --> 54:48.240
I think that's all I got.

54:48.240 --> 54:48.800
That's a lot.

54:48.800 --> 54:49.680
It's more than I did.

54:49.680 --> 54:53.120
I can tell from Googling, I think it's called My Bar Mitzvah Brunch.

54:53.120 --> 54:54.800
It's at the People's Improv Theater.

54:56.560 --> 54:58.720
Yeah, the pit where we did, we did some shows there.

54:58.720 --> 55:00.480
We did way too many shows in one day.

55:00.480 --> 55:02.560
Yeah, that was a bad move we did.

55:02.560 --> 55:04.240
You did three shows in one day?

55:04.240 --> 55:05.280
Well, I did six.

55:06.160 --> 55:10.480
Yeah, we just didn't schedule good and we were young and foolish.

55:10.480 --> 55:11.840
So that all seems good.

55:12.480 --> 55:13.040
Good advice.

55:13.760 --> 55:14.720
Well, we didn't do it.

55:14.720 --> 55:16.320
We didn't really say anything at all.

55:16.960 --> 55:18.320
No, make physical flyers.

55:18.320 --> 55:21.200
Make flyers, put it in like the neighborhood.

55:21.920 --> 55:25.680
Don't rely too much on, you know, you want to do your Facebook ads, I guess.

55:25.680 --> 55:28.240
But I'd say make a cool looking flyer.

55:28.240 --> 55:31.600
Put it up in the coffee shops and the bars around the area.

55:31.600 --> 55:33.440
Find some community cork boards.

55:33.440 --> 55:34.960
Mobilize people you know.

55:34.960 --> 55:38.560
If you're like, hey, tell a friend that like word of mouth is usually your best bet.

55:38.560 --> 55:39.520
How do you keep that?

55:39.520 --> 55:43.120
Like, how do you balance that between like trying to get people you know to come

55:43.120 --> 55:47.920
like as a favor versus, you know, how do you keep from leaning on that too heavily?

55:47.920 --> 55:48.560
You don't.

55:48.560 --> 55:49.440
I mean, it's tricky.

55:49.440 --> 55:53.440
I mean, if you know anyone that performs in any kind of like, it's a stand up a band

55:53.440 --> 55:54.000
or anything.

55:54.000 --> 55:57.280
It's just it's like, you don't want to overuse your favor.

55:57.920 --> 56:01.120
You want to help you like you want to pick one night that you tell all your friends to

56:01.120 --> 56:01.520
go to.

56:01.520 --> 56:06.720
And I try to say I like when we were starting the meltdown, Emily said, Oh, should I get

56:06.720 --> 56:07.760
a Facebook invite going?

56:07.760 --> 56:09.200
I said, No, no, I don't want to do that.

56:09.200 --> 56:13.200
Because I get resentful when I see something like a Facebook invite coming in all the time

56:13.200 --> 56:18.640
for a comedy show, it makes me actively not want to go to the comedy show there.

56:18.640 --> 56:19.680
That resistance is there.

56:19.680 --> 56:23.920
Like when I lived in Chicago for a year and I knew a lot of folks who were like doing

56:23.920 --> 56:27.200
doing stuff in Chicago, like a lot of folks who are doing stuff in Chicago.

56:27.200 --> 56:31.280
And if I went to all of their stuff, it would be literally all I did morning, noon and night.

56:33.040 --> 56:37.120
And so you had a big deal in comedy circles, Jonah, like people like whether or not somebody

56:37.120 --> 56:39.120
came to your show or whether or not you went to their show.

56:39.120 --> 56:43.280
Is that like a big an etiquette breach?

56:43.280 --> 56:43.520
Yeah, right.

56:44.160 --> 56:45.200
Yeah, it can be.

56:45.200 --> 56:49.440
It's like you want to go and you want to you want to support a show.

56:49.440 --> 56:53.920
You know, there was a there was a big thing every time, you know, someone would when we

56:53.920 --> 56:57.040
were doing the meltdown, it was just it's like, Oh, yeah, I'd love to do your show.

56:57.040 --> 56:59.840
And we would kind of just go, Yeah, come and hang out.

56:59.840 --> 57:02.880
You know, you're you're, you know, comics are always welcome to come and hang out with

57:02.880 --> 57:04.080
us at the show.

57:04.080 --> 57:09.360
And it that would kind of show that they they like, you know, wanted to be a part of like

57:09.360 --> 57:13.680
our little, you know, the thing we had going on, which was like, you know, a growing group

57:13.680 --> 57:16.000
of friends putting on a fun comedy show every week.

57:16.000 --> 57:20.240
But there was also the other people that would hear about they would just hear about the

57:20.240 --> 57:25.200
fact that it was a popular show, and then just asked to be put on without really putting

57:25.200 --> 57:26.160
in any effort.

57:26.160 --> 57:31.600
It's like, you know, we had a different idea coming into that show than just your average,

57:31.600 --> 57:35.200
you know, comedy show. And, and we didn't we didn't need to like, there's a lot there's

57:35.200 --> 57:39.600
another kind of currency for shows where it's like, if you have a show, and someone else

57:39.600 --> 57:43.760
has a show, you can kind of, there's this idea of swapping sets, it's like, Hey, I'll

57:43.760 --> 57:47.040
put you on my show. And then when you say that, you're essentially saying, Please put

57:47.040 --> 57:48.320
also put me on your show.

57:50.320 --> 57:53.840
But that, you know, but if someone has like a show that's really good, and someone has

57:53.840 --> 57:59.600
a show that's really bad, like, all of a sudden, the the discrepancy between the value

57:59.600 --> 58:03.920
of those sets becomes an issue. But it really is, it's like, if you support a show, if

58:03.920 --> 58:09.200
you go and you hang out, and you're, you know, you're not a dick, it's, it's a good

58:09.200 --> 58:12.560
way to just get on a show because it'll be like, Hey, you, thanks for coming and hanging

58:12.560 --> 58:14.800
out. Yeah, we'll put you up next week, something like that.

58:14.800 --> 58:19.600
Now, what if you have never done stand up and wouldn't know how to do stand up and

58:19.600 --> 58:21.920
don't feel like working on jokes? Can I still come?

58:21.920 --> 58:25.200
But you feel like you might be pretty good at it.

58:25.200 --> 58:30.880
This is my recommendation to you. Go to a comedy show, start heckling the comic. Do

58:30.880 --> 58:36.320
a better job. Hope that they bring you up on stage by saying, Oh, you think you're so

58:36.320 --> 58:40.240
funny? Let's see if you can do it. And that's when you break it out. That's when the moment

58:40.240 --> 58:44.240
of inspiration and with that, without the help of your magic skateboard, you're able

58:44.240 --> 58:48.000
to do the best comedy skits ever.

58:48.000 --> 58:51.280
Word for word is how Jerry Seinfeld got started.

58:51.280 --> 58:58.640
Mm hmm. Yes. Yeah. I did stand up one time, a single time.

58:58.640 --> 59:00.160
When? Where? What?

59:00.160 --> 59:07.920
Yeah, well, it was a Valentine's Day fundraiser where they have quote unquote local celebrities

59:07.920 --> 59:14.160
come and do jokes and it's a competition. Shouldn't have, should have thought through

59:14.160 --> 59:18.800
that. I worked on my set for a long time. A lot of local jokes, you know, like a lot

59:18.800 --> 59:19.800
of local references.

59:19.800 --> 59:20.800
Yeah.

59:20.800 --> 59:27.920
And then there's a great Blank Apache line, which is local jokes get you local work.

59:27.920 --> 59:31.840
I wish that had been the case for me. That would have been grand because I did get beat

59:31.840 --> 59:36.800
by a guy who works at a used car dealership around here who I think was just reciting

59:36.800 --> 59:42.320
a billings a little bit. It's impossible for me to tell. I'm not, you know, but I did

59:42.320 --> 59:46.480
get beat handily. I mean, like, and this wasn't like when I was a guy, I was fucking like

59:46.480 --> 59:52.720
six months ago. I was, it was absolutely miserable. Oh, so you got a TV show, huh? Well, let me

59:52.720 --> 59:57.760
show you how the big boys do it. And I got, I got beaten pretty badly. So that was, I

59:57.760 --> 01:00:02.640
feel like I contain, I know it's important to bomb early in your standup career to build

01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:09.280
up that like a thick skin. I think I did it all sort of in one, one night. I feel like

01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:14.400
I, that was really, that was really enough, enough to prepare me for anything.

01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:18.800
Is there anything you have that you can break us off? Even a little, just like, even just,

01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:22.560
I know I'm asking you to be very vulnerable right now. Is there anything you can break

01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:23.560
off?

01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:28.240
It was mainly about how long it takes you to get into a restaurant here in Huntington.

01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:34.080
I mean, that was basically the thrust of the, the bit. Um, it was all kind of in my noodle.

01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:35.920
I don't think I wrote in any of it down. I'm sorry.

01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:38.520
So you literally have to be there to get the joke.

01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:47.240
I mean, yeah. And apparently not even that is enough. Uh, how about another question

01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:53.400
here? Um, some TV shows now are playing pretty fast and loose with the decomposition of their

01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:58.040
zombies. At what point does it just become a spooky skeleton man? And would you say there's

01:00:58.040 --> 01:01:02.320
a significant difference between a zombie and a spooky skeleton? This quandary keeps

01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:07.280
me up at night, mostly because the nightmares are spooky skeletons. And that's from Mark.

01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:10.440
I don't think you should ever get near a xylophone if you have the thing with spooky skeleton

01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:11.440
man.

01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:18.480
The thing with zombies is that, uh, they still, you know, they need, they can't, it can't

01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:25.840
just be a skeleton walking around because there's no, uh, flesh or muscle mass to move, uh,

01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:27.800
you know, the, the limbs around.

01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:31.680
That's just science. That's just anatomy and science 101. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. And that's

01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:37.880
why, um, uh, running zombies also side note can exist. Cause if you, uh, you die and you

01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:44.200
come back, um, as a zombie, you still have the same, you still have the same muscle mass

01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:48.320
you had right when you died. So when your impulse is to go to something as fast as you

01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:52.520
can to eat it, uh, your body's going to take you there as fast as you can. But since you

01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:58.000
are dead, uh, the, the muscles will tear and not recover. And therefore that's when you

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.920
start to get that zombie, the slow zombie shuffle.

01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:03.920
I see. I've never thought about this before.

01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:06.220
I've thought about it too much.

01:02:06.220 --> 01:02:10.660
Do you think Jonah, are there some zombies that are faster than other zombies based on

01:02:10.660 --> 01:02:12.760
how fast they were in life?

01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:17.560
I'm sure. I'm sure like, yeah. Uh, I'm sure if you were a good runner, good at track or

01:02:17.560 --> 01:02:21.000
the track and field game, um, uh, for Nintendo,

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:24.700
if you're going to the track and field game for Nintendo, you could like do the essentially

01:02:24.700 --> 01:02:28.800
the super bowl shuffle in place very, very rapidly, but that's about it. And that's,

01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:31.360
I mean, that would be entertaining to see a shambler do.

01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:33.120
I think it would be a shuffler at that point.

01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:34.480
It would be a shuffler. Yeah.

01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:39.040
Oh, we got shufflers over here.

01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:40.800
We don't take the old Yankee shamblers.

01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:45.520
I get what this question asker is saying though, because like, it feels like the walking dead

01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:52.060
SFX team is like, um, they're just nasty. And I imagine there's conversations they have

01:02:52.060 --> 01:02:56.020
all the time. They're just like, look at this new nasty thing I learned how to do. This

01:02:56.020 --> 01:03:01.400
one doesn't have a butt. And it's like, Whoa, you made that one not have a butt. And, and

01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:06.200
so they're just like competing to see who can make the most nasty sort of skeletal.

01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:09.760
And I think this is going to result in like what season seven or eight, just a literal

01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:14.680
skeleton chasing Rick and the gang. Just like, this doesn't make sense. Clankety click, click,

01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:15.680
clank.

01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:19.920
I w that, that effects team, which is the Greg Nicotero effects team can be, which,

01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:25.360
uh, he was, uh, he was, uh, like an apprentice to Tom Savini, who was like the modern maker

01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:32.840
of zombies. And, um, there's, there, there is that, that element within the effects community,

01:03:32.840 --> 01:03:36.940
uh, that where it's just, everyone's like, it's everyone's just trying to one up each

01:03:36.940 --> 01:03:41.800
other with everything. That's what I still really enjoy about, uh, the walking dead is

01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:46.360
that every episode you watch, even if it's like story-wise, not the best episode, you

01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:50.880
will see a thing that you've never seen before in regards to zombies.

01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:58.920
So just thinking about zombie deterioration, you could outlast a zombie apocalypse. If

01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:05.580
you hold up long enough and like we're able to stay out of harm's way, would they deteriorate

01:04:05.580 --> 01:04:08.680
to a point where they were no longer a threat?

01:04:08.680 --> 01:04:12.880
I'd imagine so, but then it would just kind of almost become like, uh, landmines or they

01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:16.660
might, you know, fall and winter would come and they kind of get pushed into the ground.

01:04:16.660 --> 01:04:20.640
And then if you, you know, you're a kid just kind of running around a forest, uh, and then

01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:24.360
you kind of, you're sitting down and all of a sudden one kind of is able to come up and

01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:25.360
reach you.

01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:30.880
You just spooked me Jonah. You just spooked me with your words.

01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:35.160
It's very possible. And then it, and then it could start all over again. Also remember,

01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:36.160
this is all fake.

01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:40.480
Yeah. That's another thing I kind of didn't know how to breach the subject of, but like,

01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:44.680
I know you spend a lot of time thinking about zombies. Have you ever gotten on Amazon late

01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:50.940
one night and made a purchase with your money or taken any sort of action, like physical

01:04:50.940 --> 01:04:59.960
action to say like, well, just in case I, yeah, I, me and my wife have a, we have bug

01:04:59.960 --> 01:05:06.080
out bags in, uh, in both of our cars. And also, um, it's, I say it's for the, uh, the

01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:11.240
impending California earthquake, but it's also a little bit inside the back of my head

01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:16.600
of a zombie contingency plan. I just got LASIK. So in the case that, you know, uh, I lose

01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:19.880
my glasses or anything like that, I still have my vision.

01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:24.320
I will say, I'm sorry, Travis. You can't start talking yet.

01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:25.320
Just move on from that.

01:05:25.320 --> 01:05:30.120
Because Jonah just said he took on an expensive and painful elective surgery in case he dropped

01:05:30.120 --> 01:05:32.320
his glasses while the zombies were attacking him.

01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:35.920
Hey, did you know that they had an interview like, so why do you want to do this Jonah?

01:05:35.920 --> 01:05:41.760
I just want to, I think it'd be a handsome, I think it'd be, yeah, that's it. I think

01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:46.000
it'd be more handsome if I didn't have my glasses all the time.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:49.760
I think I, I think it's actually quite the opposite. I think I'm weirder looking without

01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:57.760
my glasses, but it's a price that I'll pay. It's, uh, it's not that painful. And it's,

01:05:57.760 --> 01:06:06.200
um, imagine this, uh, inevitable nuclear war, uh, you know, uh, it, it takes out everybody

01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:09.760
and then you want to read all your books. You'll have, you'll have time. You'll have

01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:14.800
time to read all your books. No glass, you will not live in fear of your glasses falling,

01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:19.120
breaking and not being able to read your precious books. You can smell your burning flesh during

01:06:19.120 --> 01:06:20.120
the procedure.

01:06:20.120 --> 01:06:21.120
That's not ideal.

01:06:21.120 --> 01:06:24.320
That's a turn off Jonah. That's a turn off.

01:06:24.320 --> 01:06:29.880
So you're, here's the thing. You're walking around with crutches, my man. You got crutches

01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:35.760
and you're, someone says to you, you know, with the technology we have with lasers, uh,

01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:38.160
we can easily make it so you don't have crutches anymore.

01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:42.640
And you're like, I think I'll just wait. The doc said six weeks with the cast. So I'm just

01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:47.440
going to wait. I guess. Thank you. Thank you. Random person approaching me in an alley with

01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:49.760
a laser gun. I think I'm just going to wait.

01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:54.000
Ah, shoot. Hey, I got some fucking lasers. I can shoot up your nose and get rid of that

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:57.280
cold. No, I'm good. I got soup kind of.

01:06:57.280 --> 01:07:04.040
Cool. Jonah, when, uh, when can we see the, uh, the, the, the, the next season of, I was

01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:08.000
gonna say Mistake 3K is on Netflix right now. When's the next season of Hidden America coming?

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:11.380
Uh, it comes out May 4th. May the 4th be with.

01:07:11.380 --> 01:07:12.380
I know that one.

01:07:12.380 --> 01:07:13.380
Oh, like the Star Wars.

01:07:13.380 --> 01:07:14.380
Star Wars.

01:07:14.380 --> 01:07:18.480
Like the Star Wars. Episode one, Phantom Menace.

01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:19.480
No.

01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:21.940
No, Jonah. We talked about this.

01:07:21.940 --> 01:07:22.940
We did talk about this.

01:07:22.940 --> 01:07:23.940
You promised.

01:07:23.940 --> 01:07:24.940
You promised.

01:07:24.940 --> 01:07:28.360
And I was given an opportunity to just revolt. Please don't hang up on me.

01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:29.360
Misa editing this out.

01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:35.600
Uh, yeah, so it's going to be on May 4th. Uh, eight new episodes and we got like a ton

01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:39.600
of really awesome people in the season. Uh, a lot of this old mystery science theater

01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:44.240
people are in it. Uh, we got Kevin Murphy playing my old, uh, band teacher from high

01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:50.680
school. Uh, we got that dude. Uh, he's so great. Trace Bolo, uh, plays, uh, uh, my uncle

01:07:50.680 --> 01:07:56.720
who was a cartoonist. Um, uh, we got Joel Hodgson and Mary Jo, uh, Peele, uh, in a scene

01:07:56.720 --> 01:07:59.080
and for many episodes, we got Bill Corbett, uh,

01:07:59.080 --> 01:08:01.400
Wow. You, you fucking collected them all.

01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:02.400
Great.

01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:03.400
Yeah.

01:08:03.400 --> 01:08:06.460
Yeah. No, it's a, it's like, I really just, I wanted to, and a ton of other like awesome

01:08:06.460 --> 01:08:10.980
people too. Like this guy that's in a ton of horror movies, uh, Derek Mears, uh, he's

01:08:10.980 --> 01:08:12.960
in the show. Jorge Garcia from Lost.

01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:13.960
Hell yeah.

01:08:13.960 --> 01:08:14.960
Yeah.

01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:19.860
Yvette Nicole Brown from, uh, uh, from Community. Just like a, I just got like a ton of like

01:08:19.860 --> 01:08:24.000
ton of awesome. Oh, Mike Hagerty, which was like huge for me to have Mike Hagerty in the

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:28.560
show. You might not know him by name, but he is the, uh, uh, you know, in the movie,

01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:33.200
uh, he's bad Billy Pratt from overboard. And he was also, he was the guy that ran the,

01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:38.960
uh, the, uh, the station at, uh, on, um, like the, the, the local station on Wayne's world.

01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:39.960
Okay.

01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:41.960
Oh shit. Okay. I know what you're talking about.

01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:42.960
Gotcha.

01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:43.960
Yeah.

01:08:43.960 --> 01:08:47.600
Gotcha. Um, and Jenna, where, where can people find this show? Hidden America. Where can

01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:48.600
people find it?

01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:54.600
It must be a really good, like a great service that everyone should subscribe to all the,

01:08:54.600 --> 01:08:56.880
all the real comedy fans are at.

01:08:56.880 --> 01:09:01.960
Yes. Uh, you know, you could find it the same spot. You saw these beautiful babies, uh,

01:09:01.960 --> 01:09:06.040
doing their wonderful show. My brother, my brother and me, which is see so, which I want

01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:10.320
to say it now on the record, even though I messaged it to you guys a while back, it is

01:09:10.320 --> 01:09:14.880
truly one of my favorite, one of my favorite shows. It is so much fun.

01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:15.880
Thank you, Jonah.

01:09:15.880 --> 01:09:22.840
It's so good. It's so good. Now cut this part out cause it'll ruin my bad boy image. Uh,

01:09:22.840 --> 01:09:28.000
but yeah, it's like you guys did such a good job. It is so fun and it has the, like the

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:33.880
perfect amount of silliness and joy and like, and also like awesome meta-ness in it too.

01:09:33.880 --> 01:09:38.460
And the, how things like could sometimes fold in on each other or the callbacks. It's just,

01:09:38.460 --> 01:09:41.200
it's all so much fun. I was really, really excited about it.

01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:42.200
Thank you, Jonah.

01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:43.200
Thank you.

01:09:43.200 --> 01:09:47.160
If I, if I knew you had this deep well of love for our show, I would have started talking

01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:51.720
about it much, much earlier. Why did we waste so much time with zombies?

01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:56.720
Uh, Jonah Ray, thank you so much for joining us. Go watch Jonah's show on see so May 4th

01:09:56.720 --> 01:10:01.520
and go watch MSC3K right now. And anything else that you want to plug? Anything anywhere

01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:03.440
else people can, can find you?

01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:05.240
No, no, that should be good.

01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:07.640
Okay, perfect. Well, thanks, right?

01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:08.640
Thank you so much for having me.

01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:13.120
Well folks, that's going to do it for us. Thank you so much for listening to our program.

01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:16.680
We hope you've had a fun time. Uh, hope you've enjoyed yourself.

01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:20.480
I just want to make sure everyone's picturing this correctly. As Justin says that, you know,

01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:24.800
we're sweeping up or putting stuff back into the, like the crates, you know, nail them

01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:30.360
up, put them back onto the podcast train to head onto the next town. Um, so just, just

01:10:30.360 --> 01:10:33.480
know like we're wiping off our podcast grease paint.

01:10:33.480 --> 01:10:34.480
Um,

01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:40.920
The door to our dressing room was cracked just a little bit. You just slipped in and

01:10:40.920 --> 01:10:47.240
you know, we're, we normally we'd have Buster throw you out, but, uh, pull up a stool.

01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:48.240
Yeah.

01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:53.240
I don't understand how I get so dirty doing this damn podcast. Every time I finish recording,

01:10:53.240 --> 01:10:56.920
I go and look at myself in the mirror and I'm just covered in grime and grease paint

01:10:56.920 --> 01:10:57.920
and dirt.

01:10:57.920 --> 01:10:58.920
Well, you're disgusting.

01:10:58.920 --> 01:11:03.440
Oh, that's it. I'm like a disgusting hog.

01:11:03.440 --> 01:11:09.560
Travis took my rhythm off. I was in a pretty good rhythm. Um, so thanks to everybody for

01:11:09.560 --> 01:11:12.400
listening. That's all my bit. Griffin, do your bit.

01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:16.880
Uh, thanks to John Roderick for the long, for the long winters. Thank you for that.

01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:19.220
And thank you for the use of our theme song. Is it a part you're off the album, putting

01:11:19.220 --> 01:11:20.220
the days to bed?

01:11:20.220 --> 01:11:25.920
Can you just, can you just slow down? And then this has been apparently a very hot topic

01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:29.960
lately. Can you just say the name of the fucking song and the album and the group?

01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:35.480
There is a band called the long winters, right? The front man and lead singer of which is

01:11:35.480 --> 01:11:42.480
John Roderick, who is a friend of the show. He's been on the show open for us in Seattle.

01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:50.180
Uh, and they, there's an album that a long winters had called putting the days to bed

01:11:50.180 --> 01:11:58.920
and track 10, I believe is called it's a departure and that is our theme song and it's very good.

01:11:58.920 --> 01:12:05.920
Um, and so go get that album. And thanks to Bob Ball for doing our intro voice. Um, I

01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:11.920
feel like that a lot of folks are asking about that these days. That's Bob Ball did our intro.

01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:13.720
Thank you, Bob Ball.

01:12:13.720 --> 01:12:20.360
Make sure to go check out a hidden America on CISO, uh, coming this week. Um, and while

01:12:20.360 --> 01:12:23.360
you're there, you should probably also check out the, my brother, my brother and me show.

01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:24.360
It's pretty good.

01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:29.120
It's pretty good. We're pretty happy with it. Um, and Mr. Science Dude with 3,000, the

01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:35.840
is up on Netflix now. Check that out as well. Um, we have a website, McElroy shows.com where

you can find all our various projects, ways to reach us, Facebook groups, Twitter accounts,

01:12:40.640 --> 01:12:45.480
PO boxes, all that stuff is there. Um, go to maximum fun.org and check out all the other

01:12:45.480 --> 01:12:49.240
amazing shows there. There are a ton on there. Uh, and I think you're going to love them

01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:52.280
all cause they're all great.

01:12:52.280 --> 01:12:56.120
And uh, that's going to do it for us. Griffin, do you have one more Yahoo to just sort of

01:12:56.120 --> 01:12:57.120
send us out on?

01:12:57.120 --> 01:13:02.720
Yeah, this one's a real thinker. It's sent in by, um, Rachel Rosen, game recognized game,

01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:08.320
Rachel Rosen. Thank you, Rachel. It's Yahoo answers user Lauren who asks, I know this

01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:18.360
sounds weird and stupid, but who closes the door when a bus driver gets off the bus?

01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:27.400
Wait a minute. Whoa. Who? Who does? Who does? Does the bus just do it? I think the bus just

01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:32.040
stays open. Does he set a timer? Does the bus know? Is it like a rubber band? Maybe

01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:37.680
it's like a rubber band and like he walks off and pulls a cable. Yeah, like a, like

01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:42.280
a peewee's big adventure breakfast machine sort of situation. I think maybe the bus driver

01:13:42.280 --> 01:13:48.640
just throws a baseball very hard at the lever. That's the only thing that makes sense. And

01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:52.440
then a Yankees recruiter sees him and he's like, Hey, you got to eat. We're ready for

01:13:52.440 --> 01:14:00.520
the big show. And then he recruits him as Tony Danza in a movie. Tony Danza is bus baseball

01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:05.600
man. My name is Justin McElroy. It would be called bus ball. My name is Justin McElroy.

01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:10.200
I'm Travis McElroy. I'm bus baseball man. This has been my brother, my brother and me.

01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:29.520
That's your dad's square on the lips.

01:14:29.520 --> 01:14:37.880
Maximum fun.org comedy and culture artist owned, listener supported. Judge John Hodgman

01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:43.180
ruled in my favor. Judge John Hodgman ruled in my friend's favor. Judge John Hodgman ruled

01:14:43.180 --> 01:14:48.880
in my favor. I'm judge John Hodgman. You're hearing the voices of real litigants, real

01:14:48.880 --> 01:14:53.800
people who have submitted disputes to my internet court at the judge John Hodgman podcast.

01:14:53.800 --> 01:14:57.960
I hear their cases. I ask them questions. They're good ones. And then I tell them who's

01:14:57.960 --> 01:15:02.760
right and who's wrong. Thanks to judge John Hodgman's ruling. My dad has been forced to

01:15:02.760 --> 01:15:08.200
retire one of the worst dad jokes of all time. Instead of cutting his own hair with a flow

01:15:08.200 --> 01:15:13.800
beat, my husband has his hair cut professionally. I have to join a community theater group and

01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:19.300
my wife has stopped bringing home wild animals. It's the judge John Hodgman podcast. Find

01:15:19.300 --> 01:15:32.880
it every Wednesday at maximum fun.org or wherever you download podcasts. Thanks judge John Hodgman.
