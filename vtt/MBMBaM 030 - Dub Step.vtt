00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:06.000 --> 00:12.000
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:12.000 --> 00:19.000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
What's up, you cool baby?

00:21.000 --> 00:30.000
If you change your mind, I'm the first in line Honey, I'm still free, take a chance on me

00:30.000 --> 00:40.000
If you need me, let me know, I'm gonna be around If you got no place to go when you're feeling down

00:40.000 --> 00:48.000
If you're all alone, when the pretty birds have flown Honey, I'm still free, take a chance on me

00:48.000 --> 00:54.000
Find it in my bed, let me know, I'm gonna be around

00:54.000 --> 01:19.000
If you need me, let me know, I'm gonna be around

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
All of them.

01:25.000 --> 01:29.000
Yeah, going once, going twice, they're all sold. To John Michael Montgomery.

01:29.000 --> 01:38.000
I'm sorry, again, to all my CMA organizers and producers. I'm sorry I get about missing the show.

01:38.000 --> 01:42.000
We were supposed to perform. My bad.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
Oh, were we?

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
Yeah.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
Which of our tracks are we gonna do?

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
John Michael Montgomery's Letters From Home.

01:48.000 --> 01:55.000
And we're actually gonna do Letters From Home's John Michael Montgomery too, which is a less well-known song and band.

01:55.000 --> 02:03.000
I fold it up and put it in my shirt, pick up my gun and get back to work.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
Please don't ever do that again.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
You just want a few more bars?

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
When did Aaron Neville get into music?

02:09.000 --> 02:14.000
I fold it up and put it in my shirt.

02:14.000 --> 02:18.000
So this is My Brother, My Brother, Me. It's an advice show for the modern era.

02:18.000 --> 02:27.000
We take your questions, your queries, and we convert them through a secret family recipe into wisdom.

02:27.000 --> 02:34.000
So here is our first question. It comes just from Gmail. It's from our buddy Nick.

02:34.000 --> 02:40.000
He says, I've been trying to sell my house so that I may pack my bags and move away for the past three months,

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
but I haven't had a single person so much as come by to look at it.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
How can I flip this bitch?

02:45.000 --> 02:54.000
Well, right from the get-go, one of the most important parts of packing your bags and moving away is the immediacy of all of it.

02:54.000 --> 03:01.000
You gotta just leave everything that doesn't fit in your bag behind with just reckless abandon and just move on.

03:01.000 --> 03:06.000
So I mean, if you really wanted to go that path, man, fuck that house.

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
Don't flip that bitch. Fuck that bitch. Get out.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
Burn that bitch.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
I smell insurance.

03:12.000 --> 03:20.000
Yes. Insurance money. Paper checks.

03:20.000 --> 03:26.000
You're doing it wrong. You're moving. You're not packing your bags. You just gotta get out.

03:26.000 --> 03:33.000
Now, as far as the house goes, as far as getting somebody to look at it, have you tried a sign that said,

03:33.000 --> 03:42.000
free house, and then when they come, they're like, this is amazing, and you say, well, not like free-free, but thank you for coming to look at it.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
Is that even a good idea? I don't think so.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
Tell everyone it's haunted.

03:46.000 --> 03:51.000
Yeah, it's all about making it stand out, so you can do that in a number of ways.

03:51.000 --> 03:58.000
Like Travis said, you can say that it's haunted and then get that sweet sci-fi channel money when they pour in there

03:58.000 --> 04:02.000
and have their dudes wander around with flashlights or whatever it is that those ghost shows do.

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
I don't watch those ghost shows because they're too spooky for me.

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
Too spooky. It is spooktacular.

04:08.000 --> 04:18.000
You could also paint it bright red and white, and then maybe people will think it's like a barn, which would be pretty cool.

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
So it may be like a bad deal on a house, but a pretty good deal on a barn.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
This is a pretty fucking good deal on this barn.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
I'll have to knock out some of these walls.

04:25.000 --> 04:29.000
Yeah, I'm not sure where the livestock's gonna go. They don't paint bedrooms.

04:29.000 --> 04:34.000
Just fill it with animals, and then when people come to look at it, inform them that the animals come with the house.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
They come standard.

04:36.000 --> 04:41.000
And say, I'm moving away in two weeks, but the animals are staying here, so you best buy this bitch quick

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
because these things, they die if they don't eat. They're like people.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
They're like people. If they don't eat, they die like us.

04:47.000 --> 04:52.000
If you don't buy this house, the blood of these farm animals will be on your hands.

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
If you do buy the house, you can name the wall whatever you want.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
Also, talking furniture.

04:57.000 --> 05:01.000
Did you get, did you even think to buy talking furniture?

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
If not, then that was not a good investment.

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
Yeah, I feel like we're having to hold your hand.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
Of course, Yari, I'm just gonna assume that you already have talking furniture.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
The talking furniture needs to eat too.

05:11.000 --> 05:16.000
And again, like two weeks and I'm ghost, so like, it will die as well.

05:16.000 --> 05:21.000
So this is kind of a, I don't mean to put a gun to your head, but you know.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
But I do have a gun to your head. That's another idea.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
I do have a gun to your head. Buy this house!

05:25.000 --> 05:39.000
I would also suggest upgrading your cabinetry because that can be an inexpensive way of getting some more bang for your buck.

05:39.000 --> 05:46.000
And maybe, maybe rip up that carpeting and just, you know, just polish that wood.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
Get some beautiful hardwood underneath there.

05:48.000 --> 05:52.000
A new coat of paint goes a long way to really spruce up the place.

05:52.000 --> 05:56.000
Speaking of spruce, have you considered spruce hardwood floors?

05:56.000 --> 06:01.000
Just polish it and give it that fine oaky veneer.

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
Have you considered a scale model of the spruce goose?

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
Howard Hughes' ill-fated giant aircraft.

06:07.000 --> 06:13.000
I'm gonna say, once our show reaches its third spruce goose reference, it's over.

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
Then we should be number one on iTunes. Yes, I agree.

06:16.000 --> 06:20.000
If we're not number one on iTunes by the third goose, we're done.

06:20.000 --> 06:28.000
So, Nick, to recap, spruce it, goose it, polish it, goose it, ghost it, and talking furniture.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
Alright, Nick, kill farm animals? Yeah.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
Done.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
Form Spring. We just saved the economy, by the way.

06:33.000 --> 06:38.000
Yeah. Hey, you're welcome, Bob Vila. Doing a job for you there.

06:38.000 --> 06:43.000
I always seem to rule out girls that have the same name as me or someone in my family.

06:43.000 --> 06:47.000
This includes extended family like cousins, etc.

06:47.000 --> 06:54.000
Since I think it would be awkward if I brought her home and introduced her to my family member.

06:54.000 --> 06:58.000
Hey, Susan. This is Susan. Guess why I picked her.

06:58.000 --> 07:02.000
Did you guess yet, Susan? I'm only voting one of you. You pick which.

07:02.000 --> 07:07.000
It's not what you think. If what you think is that I did it for a normal reason, then it's not that.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
It's not what you think.

07:09.000 --> 07:13.000
See, this seems like one of those things where the act of thinking it makes it so.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
Yeah, right, right.

07:14.000 --> 07:20.000
It's that reality field where it's sort of like when we talked about kissing your dad.

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
The moment you wonder whether or not it's weird, it is weird.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
It's just as bad as doing it.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
Because you wondered it.

07:26.000 --> 07:33.000
So it wouldn't be weird if Griffin were to date someone with the same name as someone in our family because he's never thought it.

07:33.000 --> 07:37.000
But now that you've thought it, it would be weird because you'd be making a choice.

07:37.000 --> 07:41.000
I do like that you specified the same name as you or someone in your family.

07:41.000 --> 07:46.000
Who are you encountering? I could see that with, like, Ryan and Ryan.

07:46.000 --> 07:51.000
But, like, my name is, you know, Steven, and this is my girlfriend, Steven.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
Like, is that a problem you have a lot?

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
I am also named Derek.

07:55.000 --> 07:59.000
Hello. I am Derek 1. She is Derek 2.

07:59.000 --> 08:10.000
Sometimes in this world, Travis, people who are a certain gender will be able to develop feelings towards people of that same gender.

08:10.000 --> 08:15.000
Which I know is a strange concept to wrap your mind around at first, but it is a real thing.

08:15.000 --> 08:19.000
So it is possible that maybe he doesn't want to date, like, he doesn't specify gender.

08:19.000 --> 08:25.000
Maybe he is a gay gentleman, and maybe he has weird feelings about dating a dude with the same name as his dad.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
I totes get that.

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
Yeah, that absolutely is not weird. That sounds like a good.

08:30.000 --> 08:34.000
Now, okay, but see, here's the problem, and this is where all this always falls apart.

08:34.000 --> 08:38.000
Do you, I mean, you, is this a general rule?

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
Like, is it okay as a general standard? Sure.

08:41.000 --> 08:46.000
Should it keep you from somebody who, like, you're crazy about? Probably not.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
I mean, that doesn't even make sense.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
I mean, but as a rule?

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
Like, you're just thinning the herd.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
What if her name is Grandma, though?

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
This is my girlfriend, Meemaw.

08:58.000 --> 09:09.000
Hey, listen, Jerry, would it, I know things didn't go so well between you two. Would it be weird if I was to date Meemaw?

09:09.000 --> 09:14.000
Would it be, and now I do not mean your ex-girlfriend, I mean your actual Meemaw.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
Your literal Meemaw.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
Would that be okay?

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
See, here's the thing.

09:18.000 --> 09:21.000
Going into this question, I was straight up to, no, that's not weird.

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
You shouldn't date someone that has, like, the same name as your brother or something like that.

09:24.000 --> 09:33.000
But now I feel like that's a, like, you pointed that out, Justin, and now I'm wondering, like, how far does that rule go?

09:33.000 --> 09:43.000
Like, if you met an amazing girl and then, like, you found out that she was going by her middle name and her real first name was the same name as your aunt, do you break up with her?

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
Here's this hypothetical I'm going to put on you.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
Listen, Aunt Kathy, this isn't working out.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
I'm going to put this hypothetical on you, okay?

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
Give me.

09:51.000 --> 10:01.000
Like, I have met at least one female named Griffin, so could you date a female Griffin?

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
If she was, I mean, if you weren't married.

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
Assuming she had already had her, like, her talons removed and things, right?

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
Yes.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
No, no, no, no.

10:08.000 --> 10:14.000
If, like, I'm, like, a real, genuine, fantastic woman named Griffin, would that be weird for you?

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
Yes.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
If you guys weren't dating?

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
Yeah.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
See?

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
There it is.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
Very weird.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
You've got to qualify it with, like, do we get along well?

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
But no, that's just fucking weird.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
It's just weird, man.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
It is just fucking weird.

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
Like, I've met female Justins.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
No fucking way.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
No way.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
No way.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
Zero percent chance.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
No way would that ever happen.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
You know what, FormSpring?

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
I flip.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
You're right.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
Good standard.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
Stick with it.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
Don't do it.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
You're right.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
I got a Yahoo.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
Give me.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
Hold out.

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
This one is by Yahoo Answers user Slappy4.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
Sure.

10:48.000 --> 10:52.000
He did it with Roman numerals, too, to let everyone know.

10:52.000 --> 10:55.000
It's like a movie.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
Slapnacious.

10:56.000 --> 11:05.640
He asks, what will a tattoo on a babby look like later after the babby grows up into adult?

11:05.640 --> 11:07.880
My child will get a dragon tattoo.

11:07.880 --> 11:09.480
It is the tradition in my family.

11:09.480 --> 11:12.560
However, I am wondering what it will look like when he gets bigger.

11:12.560 --> 11:15.140
Will it become big dragon or be all spread out?

11:15.140 --> 11:25.960
This is posted in babby names because his name is Merrick Power Sword.

11:25.960 --> 11:26.960
First things first.

11:26.960 --> 11:27.960
Yeah.

11:27.960 --> 11:28.960
What is the first thing?

11:28.960 --> 11:30.320
If you could illuminate that for me, I would appreciate it.

11:30.320 --> 11:35.540
If people on the internet don't learn how to spell the word baby, I'm going to cut off

11:35.540 --> 11:40.680
my own head and throw it in the river.

11:40.680 --> 11:41.680
Baby.

11:41.680 --> 11:42.680
Four letters.

11:42.680 --> 11:44.480
You start out life as that thing.

11:44.480 --> 11:47.920
You would think it would be the very first thing you learn how to spell.

11:47.920 --> 11:48.920
What am I?

11:48.920 --> 11:49.920
When you first become self-aware.

11:49.920 --> 11:50.920
B-A-B-Y.

11:50.920 --> 11:51.920
Got it.

11:51.920 --> 11:55.840
I'm going to lock that down for the rest of my life.

11:55.840 --> 11:56.840
B.

11:56.840 --> 11:57.840
So far so good.

11:57.840 --> 11:58.840
A. Doing great.

11:58.840 --> 11:59.840
All right.

11:59.840 --> 12:00.840
B. Okay.

12:00.840 --> 12:01.840
B. Whoa.

12:01.840 --> 12:02.840
Whoa.

12:02.840 --> 12:03.840
See?

12:03.840 --> 12:04.840
Now you jumped it.

12:04.840 --> 12:05.840
You did one too many.

12:05.840 --> 12:06.840
I know it's a nice letter.

12:06.840 --> 12:10.880
It's got a sweet curvature, but you've got to chill out on that.

12:10.880 --> 12:12.680
It's going to look like silly putty, basically.

12:12.680 --> 12:14.240
That's exactly what I was going to say.

12:14.240 --> 12:15.240
Yeah.

12:15.240 --> 12:16.240
That's what it's going to look like.

12:16.240 --> 12:18.840
It's going to look like stretched out silly putty, and your baby's going to be like,

12:18.840 --> 12:19.840
I wish I'd had a choice.

12:19.840 --> 12:23.400
A. Like when you took Prince Caspian and you just smeared his face out.

12:23.400 --> 12:24.880
It's going to look exactly like that.

12:24.880 --> 12:31.840
B. I think that you guys are thinking that this baby is going to be capable of logical

12:31.840 --> 12:39.540
thought and comprehension after you give it a fucking tattoo when it's four weeks old.

12:39.540 --> 12:44.360
I got a tattoo when I was 18, 19, and it hurt like a bitch.

12:44.360 --> 12:49.280
Can you imagine being a baby and just for a solid half hour, just the most excruciating

12:49.280 --> 12:50.280
thing?

12:50.280 --> 12:51.280
A. Yeah, but we're not babies.

12:51.280 --> 12:52.280
B. Is this life?

12:52.280 --> 12:53.280
I don't like this anymore.

12:53.280 --> 12:54.280
A. Hey.

12:54.280 --> 12:55.280
Spoiler alert.

12:55.280 --> 12:57.320
When you're a baby, somebody cut the tip of your dick off.

12:57.320 --> 12:58.320
B. Yeah.

12:58.320 --> 12:59.320
I guess that's true.

12:59.320 --> 13:01.400
A. Oh, that stings.

13:01.400 --> 13:02.400
That stings a little bit.

13:02.400 --> 13:06.120
What you're doing with the needle, that, ooh, ooh, it's like a bad sunburn.

13:06.120 --> 13:09.600
It's not as bad as a few seconds ago when you cut my dick off.

13:09.600 --> 13:12.200
B. It's not quite as bad as the bris I got.

13:12.200 --> 13:15.720
A. I want to meet that awesome tattoo artist.

13:15.720 --> 13:16.720
You got a baby?

13:16.720 --> 13:17.720
Yeah, fuck it.

13:17.720 --> 13:18.720
I'll do it.

13:18.720 --> 13:19.720
B. Yeah, fuck it.

13:19.720 --> 13:20.720
A. Tape him down.

13:20.720 --> 13:21.720
B. Maybe I'll tattoo a baby.

13:21.720 --> 13:24.540
B. I just read one of the answers.

13:24.540 --> 13:32.600
It's from user Katumble, which is K, apostrophe, tumble.

13:32.600 --> 13:35.200
Katumble says, get him a lizard.

13:35.200 --> 13:38.960
It will grow into a big dragon as the babby grows.

13:38.960 --> 13:47.120
First of all, don't fucking encourage them with the babby talk.

13:47.120 --> 13:48.120
Second of all, you dumb bitch.

13:48.120 --> 13:49.120
What are you saying?

13:49.120 --> 13:50.120
A. What are you saying?

13:50.120 --> 13:53.600
Do you think they're going to do that instead of that?

13:53.600 --> 13:59.520
My child didn't get a dragon tattoo, so instead we let him ride this giant iguana around the

13:59.520 --> 14:00.520
house.

14:00.520 --> 14:01.520
We bought him a Komodo dragon.

14:01.520 --> 14:07.880
B. No, I think he's saying tattoo a lizard on his body and at, I guess, certain intervals

14:07.880 --> 14:13.200
throughout that child's life, it'll grow into a dragon.

14:13.200 --> 14:15.640
First of all, lizards don't just become dragons.

14:15.640 --> 14:19.320
A. And they don't live in a tattoo.

14:19.320 --> 14:20.320
B. They don't.

14:20.320 --> 14:23.080
I mean, it'd be pretty fucking sweet if they did.

14:23.080 --> 14:24.360
A. Fuck, that'd be sweet though.

14:24.360 --> 14:25.360
I would get one.

14:25.360 --> 14:29.840
If someone said, Justin, if you get an iguana tattoo on your baby, by the time it's old,

14:29.840 --> 14:31.920
it would be a sentient dragon tattoo.

14:31.920 --> 14:32.920
I would do it.

14:32.920 --> 14:33.920
B. With Eddie Murphy's voice.

14:33.920 --> 14:34.920
A. Yeah.

14:34.920 --> 14:35.920
B. Yeah.

14:35.920 --> 14:36.920
B. From Milan.

14:36.920 --> 14:37.920
A. From Milan.

14:37.920 --> 14:41.560
Uh, let's, let's, we, we got one from us, um, well, I, I don't want to give it away

14:41.560 --> 14:42.560
just yet.

14:42.560 --> 14:48.680
Uh, I smoke a small amount of marijuana on occasion to unwind after a long day of work.

14:48.680 --> 14:51.640
This clearly bugs my girlfriend on an ideological level.

14:51.640 --> 14:56.680
I don't bug out or need to be taken care of, she just doesn't like the idea of it.

14:56.680 --> 14:59.360
When she wants to relax, she drinks wine.

14:59.360 --> 15:03.480
I try to argue that despite its illegality, it helps her relax.

15:03.480 --> 15:07.000
She has a pretty negative association with the drug, since she knew some pretty unsavory

15:07.000 --> 15:08.780
types who did it in college.

15:08.780 --> 15:13.200
I don't want to sneak joints since I'm a grown ass man, but I also don't want to disappoint

15:13.200 --> 15:14.200
her.

15:14.200 --> 15:17.680
What should I do, stoned and stumped, in St. Paul?

15:17.680 --> 15:21.240
B. Those two things, like, they seem kind of like they go hand in hand.

15:21.240 --> 15:22.240
A. Yeah.

15:22.240 --> 15:23.240
B. Right?

15:23.240 --> 15:24.240
A. I can't figure this out.

15:24.240 --> 15:25.240
B. I don't know what to do.

15:25.240 --> 15:33.280
A. In my opinion, if she gets to drink wine, you get to smoke weed.

15:33.280 --> 15:39.040
B. Tell her that you will stop smoking weed when she stops drinking wine, and then ask

15:39.040 --> 15:47.480
her about auto-related fatalities that were caused by wine, and then ask her about auto-fatalities

15:47.480 --> 15:48.480
caused by marijuana.

15:48.480 --> 15:55.000
A. Ask her how many marijuana addicts anonymous groups there are.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
B. Zero.

15:56.000 --> 16:04.200
A. But you guys are ignoring, like, if maybe she doesn't, I want to play devil's advocate

16:04.200 --> 16:09.160
here, maybe she doesn't, you know, maybe she doesn't want her dude coming home from

16:09.160 --> 16:11.480
Target every day with a new beanbag chair.

16:11.480 --> 16:12.480
Right?

16:12.480 --> 16:15.960
B. What happened to the casserole I made?

16:15.960 --> 16:16.960
I ate the entire thing.

16:16.960 --> 16:17.960
I'm very sorry.

16:17.960 --> 16:20.520
A. I ate the whole thing on my bed of beanbag chairs.

16:20.520 --> 16:24.000
B. You spent our baby's college money on Hostess cupcakes.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.720
A. I thought it was Babby.

16:25.720 --> 16:30.200
No, that's because you're a piehead, you're on Yahoo Answers.

16:30.200 --> 16:32.240
This is all societal, right?

16:32.240 --> 16:36.600
There's a connotation to being someone who smokes marijuana every day, and it's not a

16:36.600 --> 16:38.280
positive connotation.

16:38.280 --> 16:43.240
You know, wine is very glamorous, I think, or at least has been classed up considerably.

16:43.240 --> 16:46.000
B. But you're still getting drunk.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.000
A. Right.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.800
Like, it's, the end effect is the same.

16:48.800 --> 16:50.920
B. And your teeth are turning red.

16:50.920 --> 16:51.920
It's gross.

16:51.920 --> 16:55.360
A. It sounds like her, it sounds like her hangup, honestly.

16:55.360 --> 16:58.080
It sounds like something that she really needs to get over.

16:58.080 --> 17:02.920
I think that if she cares about you, and it's important enough to you that you're like,

17:02.920 --> 17:06.920
not, most things when you're in a relationship and they irritate the other person, you just

17:06.920 --> 17:07.920
stop doing them.

17:07.920 --> 17:08.920
Right?

17:08.920 --> 17:10.720
Like, how many things do you just like, okay, I don't care.

17:10.720 --> 17:11.720
Yeah, fine.

17:11.720 --> 17:14.420
I'll put the soap in this tray instead of whatever.

17:14.420 --> 17:18.080
But this sounds like something that it's, it's important to you, and I think that if

17:18.080 --> 17:24.680
she loves you, then, then you expressing that to her, saying like, hey, this is something

17:24.680 --> 17:29.320
that I enjoy, and it's meaningful to me, and I would like to keep doing it.

17:29.320 --> 17:31.800
B. Can I make another suggestion?

17:31.800 --> 17:33.040
A. She should respect that.

17:33.040 --> 17:34.040
Yeah.

17:34.040 --> 17:39.680
B. Just go outside and look into the sun for like, I don't know, as long as you can, an

17:39.680 --> 17:40.680
hour or two.

17:40.680 --> 17:41.680
A. Does it get too high?

17:41.680 --> 17:44.280
B. No, no, no, no, but you will get wicked cataracts.

17:44.280 --> 17:46.440
And then you, you gotta get on that weed then.

17:46.440 --> 17:48.360
A. Oh, you gotta get a prescription.

17:48.360 --> 17:50.360
B. Then it's like, not even your choice.

17:50.360 --> 17:53.080
Then if she says shit about it, you can be like, baby, it's medical.

17:53.080 --> 17:54.480
A. It's from the cats.

17:54.480 --> 17:56.040
B. It's from the cats.

17:56.040 --> 18:02.320
A. No matter what you do, don't sneak joints, because that shit smells like, you're not

18:02.320 --> 18:03.600
going to hide that.

18:03.600 --> 18:08.440
And then she's going to know, and you're going to know, and if you're sneaking it, then,

18:08.440 --> 18:13.160
you know, you're pretending that she doesn't know, and I find that slightly offensive.

18:13.160 --> 18:18.000
So just do it and be like, baby, here's what I'm doing. I'm sorry. I know you don't like

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
it, but I do.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
And...

18:20.000 --> 18:23.800
B. Do you know what's offensive? Do you know what's offensive? This is against the law.

18:23.800 --> 18:27.840
Why are we even talking about this? This is, this is against, this is an infraction.

18:27.840 --> 18:29.280
A. Except it's illegal.

18:29.280 --> 18:33.000
B. It's illegal, Stone and Stump. Maybe your wife doesn't want to go to jail.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.000
A. Forever.

18:34.000 --> 18:38.360
B. For harboring a drug terrorist, which is basically what you are.

18:38.360 --> 18:39.360
A. Yeah.

18:39.360 --> 18:41.640
B. St. Paul, do you know how strict their, their weed laws are?

18:41.640 --> 18:42.640
A. Not very.

18:42.640 --> 18:48.000
B. Probably super strict, because it's got a saint in it, and they, the saints, I guess,

18:48.000 --> 18:51.280
don't like weed. I don't know where that, that line of logic is going.

18:51.280 --> 18:53.320
A. Except for St. Mary Jane.

18:53.320 --> 18:54.320
B. It's illegal.

18:54.320 --> 18:55.320
A. Woo!

18:55.320 --> 18:56.320
B. Woo!

18:56.320 --> 18:59.280
B. What? It's illegal. I don't even want to talk about this anymore. I'm disgusted with

18:59.280 --> 19:00.280
this for an adult, Chan.

19:00.280 --> 19:05.200
A. I've called, I just called the cops. I'm calling the cops right now.

19:05.200 --> 19:12.080
B. Shane. Shane writes to us from Gmail, and he says, I've packed my bags and moved away.

19:12.080 --> 19:17.400
All the way across the nation, in fact. New York to Oregon. But I still find myself thinking

19:17.400 --> 19:25.240
of my ex-girlfriend. We were together six years. Daily. What do I do now? Shit, man.

19:25.240 --> 19:26.720
There's not a part two.

19:26.720 --> 19:33.000
A. I guess move back and try again. Move back and then move away again.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
B. Yeah.

19:34.000 --> 19:39.240
A. I mean, we could tell you some cool shit to do in Oregon, I guess. I hear there's the,

19:39.240 --> 19:41.320
the Rocky Mountains are like right there.

19:41.320 --> 19:47.760
B. You got to get back. You got to get back up on the horse. Got to get back up on the

19:47.760 --> 19:52.800
horse. This is what you're feeling is utterly natural because you did not just let go of

19:52.800 --> 19:59.440
a girl. You let go of six years of your life that you spent with this person. You, you

19:59.440 --> 20:04.560
create a whole identity for yourself and that part of yourself is gone too, but it is gone.

20:04.560 --> 20:12.280
You got to get a bite out of that recovery sandwich and get back on the horse and go,

20:12.280 --> 20:18.320
go get down. Get, get into it. Get out there. Get, drink deep and don't waste another second

20:18.320 --> 20:19.760
on this girl that you're done with.

20:19.760 --> 20:25.160
A. Especially if you just moved across the country to a new, you know, state where you

20:25.160 --> 20:31.240
don't know many people probably. Harboring, you know, feelings for an ex. That's, that's

20:31.240 --> 20:35.200
not the way to, that's not the way to, you know, lay down roots in a new town.

20:35.200 --> 20:40.560
B. That is true. And I think that part of thinking about her daily, it's kind of a self-fulfilling

20:40.560 --> 20:44.880
prophecy is because you keep thinking about her, you keep thinking about her. And I know

20:44.880 --> 20:48.840
that this sounds kind of offhand, but you got to stop thinking about it. You got to

20:48.840 --> 20:56.440
get a hobby, you know, go explore your new city, make some new friends, go to a concert.

20:56.440 --> 21:01.360
Just take your mind off it and your mind will be off it. You don't want to think about her

21:01.360 --> 21:06.440
as much. It's, ask anybody who's ever been in a long-term relationship and then ended

21:06.440 --> 21:13.280
up, you know, who've been in several relationships and ended up in the right one that you don't

21:13.280 --> 21:17.700
miss this person. It feels like that, but what you miss is, is being in a relationship.

21:17.700 --> 21:22.320
If you miss this person, you wouldn't have, have ended it. Now, now if they ended it,

21:22.320 --> 21:26.120
either way it's, you've got to convince yourself that they weren't the right person for you

21:26.120 --> 21:32.560
and what you miss is being with somebody who you care about. And that is not the futile

21:32.560 --> 21:36.800
position that you have put yourself in right now. There's nothing you can do about the

21:36.800 --> 21:40.400
situation you put yourself in so that you got to change the rules. You got to change

21:40.400 --> 21:46.480
the dynamic of this problem until it's something you can action. You can.

21:46.480 --> 21:51.940
And also be careful that you're not going hunting for that same level of comfort immediately.

21:51.940 --> 21:56.080
That's not going to happen. Your next relationship, you're going to want to make it at the same

21:56.080 --> 22:00.800
level that this six year relationship ended up at. And that's not how this works. That's

22:00.800 --> 22:04.720
why you get people who rebound and stuff like that, because you're trying to force this

22:04.720 --> 22:09.000
to be that comfort level and you just got to go out and have fun, brother. You just

22:09.000 --> 22:11.120
got to get stoned and stumped.

22:11.120 --> 22:17.000
Yeah. I just had a great idea. Um, what if to help him, you know, cope with this, you

22:17.000 --> 22:21.000
know, the pain that he's obviously struggling with. What if we brought Shane on the show

22:21.000 --> 22:27.140
every week? Um, and we did a weekly segment where like if we found like a really bad Yahoo

22:27.140 --> 22:31.100
answers question or if somebody sent in a question where it's like, uh, I'm cheating

22:31.100 --> 22:35.520
on my wife. How do I, you know, like something just like, Oh, you're a terrible person.

22:35.520 --> 22:44.440
We get Shane on the show. We do a segment, uh, called Shane on you. Um, it could be just

22:44.440 --> 22:48.520
as simple as just getting Shane, like we read the question and then we get like maybe just

22:48.520 --> 22:57.720
a clip of Shane just going, uh, Shane on you, Shane, if you want to send us an MP3, um,

22:57.720 --> 23:03.720
I got a Yahoo. Yeah. Give it to me. Oh wait, wait, wait. You, you mentioned people in the

23:03.720 --> 23:10.520
show and you reminded me our buddy Tristan, he's back. The Marine is back. He's better

23:10.520 --> 23:17.880
than ever. He's like full Marine. He's like cut from glass. No, he looks like a chiseled

23:17.880 --> 23:25.560
like Athenian God wearing a small, uh, Hey Jeffrey shirt and he looks like it, like a,

23:25.560 --> 23:30.440
like a, some sort of superhero, like a war superhero. It's incredible, but we're glad

23:30.440 --> 23:34.920
to have him back and we're glad that he's shipping back out for, for more training.

23:34.920 --> 23:39.720
I think later down. No, I'm just saying, but we have a nice little, we have a nice little

23:39.720 --> 23:43.400
two week window here where we can just like, you know, just chill with and then he's off

23:43.400 --> 23:49.320
to kill again. Yeah. Offer more murder. I think he's going to training camp again. So

23:49.320 --> 23:56.440
I'm not sure. Training for killing, training for murder. Although I loved all of his, he's

23:56.440 --> 24:00.360
got a new perspective on life and that much is clear. He's the Triscuit on Twitter if

24:00.360 --> 24:03.720
you want to follow him, but he's got a new perspective on life. Like, um, he went back

24:03.720 --> 24:07.240
and listened to all the old episodes and heard that people were complaining that we didn't

24:07.240 --> 24:11.880
do an episode on labor day, uh, to which he responded. I got four hours off on labor day.

24:11.880 --> 24:15.960
The rest of the time I was, you know, crawling through human excrement or whatever they make

24:15.960 --> 24:19.560
you do in Marine training camp. And he was happy about it. He was totally happy. You know

24:19.560 --> 24:26.840
why? Cause he loves fucking freedom. Yahoo me. Thank you, Tristan, for everything. Thank

24:26.840 --> 24:32.440
you, Tristan, for the freedom. Yeah. Um, this one was sent in by John and Tony Magickers,

24:33.080 --> 24:38.680
uh, which is, that's not even the Yahoo answer. That's like the guys who sent it in, but it's

24:38.680 --> 24:44.520
from one email account. We have the best names. I know. Um, I guess they share it. Uh, but

24:44.520 --> 24:51.160
thank you, John and Tony Magickers. They're the Magickers. I love it. Yahoo answers user

24:51.880 --> 24:56.520
Chelsea Ann. There's a whole bunch of like punctuation marks in there that I didn't read

24:56.520 --> 25:00.120
because I wouldn't know how to like verbalize them, but we'll just boil it down to its,

25:00.120 --> 25:07.480
its core components, which are Chelsea Ann. Chelsea Ann asks, when a movie star watches

25:07.480 --> 25:14.840
a movie with them in it, is it like watching a home video of themselves? Oh, it's so awesome.

25:16.680 --> 25:21.560
Can you imagine like when Robert Pattison watches Twilight and he's like, this is when I was a

25:21.560 --> 25:28.040
vampire. I remember like Will Smith watching any movie he ever did. Like I have the coolest fucking

25:28.040 --> 25:33.480
life ever. He calls up old Goldblum and he's like, Goldblum, remember when we took down those

25:33.480 --> 25:38.360
aliens together? That was awesome. I don't, I don't remember that well. I, it was in a movie.

25:38.360 --> 25:43.480
No, no, we totally did it. I have video proof. Welcome to Earth. Do you remember when I said,

25:43.480 --> 25:49.800
welcome to Earth? It was awesome. Now Willow, when I was, uh, when I was 29 years old, uh,

25:49.800 --> 25:55.640
I stopped the robot apocalypse from happening with a robot Alan Tudyk. It's like after Liam

25:55.640 --> 26:00.200
Neeson's been, uh, been watching his home movies at his house, he walks up to Jewish people and

26:00.200 --> 26:10.280
just says, you're welcome. No, no need to thank me in great. I just put your parents on my list.

26:11.000 --> 26:15.640
Do you think Adam Sandler watches his home movies and it's like, what's wrong with me?

26:17.720 --> 26:26.280
Why did, for a brief period in my early thirties, late twenties, was, was I a mentally handicapped

26:26.280 --> 26:31.640
gentleman? Do you think it really confuses Bruce Willis when he watches Armageddon? Yeah. He's

26:31.640 --> 26:41.880
like, oh, I'm dead. Oh, he watches six cents and he's confused. Oh shit. Oh my God. Yeah. You want

26:41.880 --> 26:48.200
to talk about somebody? What a twist. Elijah Wood. Elijah Wood. That was weird. What a sweeping

26:48.200 --> 26:55.400
adventure that was. Don't remember that. Uh, Sam Jackson, not in the belly of a shark. No,

26:55.400 --> 27:01.160
well half of it isn't. Yeah. Uh, I don't think that there's anybody who really,

27:02.200 --> 27:06.200
maybe Polly Shore does that and he gets a little sad cause he was always doing things that I think

27:06.200 --> 27:11.480
were more, um, important than when he was actually doing. He was always joining the army or running a

27:11.480 --> 27:18.440
family farm or wheezing the juice or wheezing the juice. Maybe, you know, he was fighting,

27:18.440 --> 27:25.000
okay. He was like fighting for, for, um, you know, like ecological equality and biodome.

27:25.000 --> 27:28.840
Like that was a pretty important, that was a pretty important issue that he just tackled

27:28.840 --> 27:34.280
at first. And then he made some trouble in that bubble. He did make some trouble in that bubble

27:34.280 --> 27:40.360
with who was that? Was that one of the, that was Steven, uh, Steven Baldwin. It was actually

27:40.360 --> 27:47.400
Alec Baldwin. No, it fucking wasn't. It would have been way better. Are you kidding me, Travis?

27:47.400 --> 27:51.640
No, I just wanted that to be true. I know that. I just, God, I wanted that to be true.

27:51.640 --> 27:56.840
He's so slick. God, he's so cool. Such a slick guy. I bet he just leave the biodome and be like,

27:56.840 --> 28:02.200
well, I'm not staying here. I'm Alec Baldwin. I've got to go be rad. What are we talking about?

28:02.200 --> 28:06.120
Like what are we even doing on this show? I have, I'm going to ask an actual question

28:06.680 --> 28:12.120
and actual advice it. Advice it up. As they say, uh, I need some professional advice.

28:12.120 --> 28:18.200
Well, you've come to the right place. My coworker who has a level above me in my project group just,

28:18.200 --> 28:21.240
whoa, I'm getting way corporate here. I'm going to slow it down a little bit.

28:22.840 --> 28:28.360
My coworker who was a level above me in my project group just left the company and I have inherited

28:28.360 --> 28:34.440
all of his work. I've been doing the work of two, but still getting paid the same. I'm hoping MBM

28:34.440 --> 28:40.200
can advise me in how to make more cheddar overworked and underpaid. Strike.

28:40.200 --> 28:47.800
You got a strike. Just a big strike. One man's strike. One man's strike it. You may not be able

28:47.800 --> 28:54.440
to tell from our, our conversations, but we are union men through and through. Yeah. Yeah. We are

28:54.440 --> 28:59.960
pro through and through. Um, you gotta, you gotta make a stand. You gotta draw a line in the sand

29:00.600 --> 29:05.800
and show them which side you're on. Uh, just anytime someone goes into your building,

29:05.800 --> 29:12.200
call them a strike breaker, call them a scab. Although technically no one can scab because

29:12.200 --> 29:17.240
it is a one man strike. So there could not be a scab. It's just you. You could, but you'd have to

29:17.240 --> 29:21.720
like guilt them. Like you wouldn't be able to physically stop them, but you'd be like, oh,

29:21.720 --> 29:27.240
come on, come on. I'm trying to make a difference. Come on. I'm having a hard time of it.

29:27.960 --> 29:31.640
Right now you're doing the work of two men getting paid for the work of one.

29:31.640 --> 29:36.200
Yeah. You gotta do the work of half a man and just wait until it evens out. Yep.

29:36.200 --> 29:42.040
Till you've like, till balance sheets are clear. Have you considered creating an alternate

29:42.040 --> 29:46.760
personality that collects collects a separate paycheck, like wearing a mustache and a darker

29:46.760 --> 29:51.880
shirt and walking out going, uh, I didn't get paid this week. Um, yeah, that's how,

29:51.880 --> 29:57.080
that's how jobs work. I'm, I'm Jim's partner. I'm Jim's partner on that big project. I didn't get

29:57.080 --> 30:09.960
paid. I've got, I'm at the payment office. I working on the big project project that I,

30:09.960 --> 30:14.680
my other identity is also definitely really working on, but I'm pretending like I don't know

30:14.680 --> 30:26.040
the name of it. Oh, my name it's Jonas. Please money. Jonas, please money. Hi, I'm Jonas. Please

30:26.040 --> 30:31.560
money. Please ignore my monocle and the fact that my, my mustache, the spirit gum is peeling off

30:31.560 --> 30:36.040
and causing it to fall off of my face. But I will need that paycheck now, please. I do need my

30:36.040 --> 30:46.120
paycheck. Um, the, the police money family isn't going to feed themselves. Uh, did you try asking

30:46.120 --> 30:53.480
your boss? Cause that's what I would do. Say, Hey, this isn't fair. And you know what? I'll be super

30:53.480 --> 30:58.200
straight with you. Things are not so good in the economy right now. So they're probably doing this

30:58.200 --> 31:02.760
because they know it would be very difficult for you to find another job. And that sucks,

31:03.560 --> 31:09.000
but there's probably not a lot you can do about it right now. And sometimes you got to do crap

31:09.000 --> 31:15.320
like that so that later you can say, Hey, remember when I did that crap? Like think of this as like

31:15.320 --> 31:21.640
storing up, you know, ammunition for when you come up for your yearly review or whatever happens in

31:21.640 --> 31:25.480
the corporate world. And you say, you know, I've been doing a lot of work lately. I've really been

31:25.480 --> 31:30.360
picking up the slack. I think it's time, you know, that I get promoted and say, you know, like this

31:30.360 --> 31:34.680
guy quit, you didn't replace him. And honestly, I, I think it's fair that if I'm going to do all

31:34.680 --> 31:39.960
this work, I should get some of the money. There's nothing, there's nothing wrong with asking that.

31:39.960 --> 31:47.480
Like they, managers and owners go around all day, hoping you don't ask that. Like if you don't ask

31:47.480 --> 31:52.600
that, then that is what they would like very much for you to do. Especially if you're doing this

31:52.600 --> 31:59.320
much work. I mean, you know, fear of bad economy aside, if you're doing this much work, you're

31:59.320 --> 32:04.760
probably helping them out a lot. So like they don't need to pay you twice as much as you're

32:04.760 --> 32:11.960
getting paid now, but you know, just throw some bones your way. 100% raise. 100% raise or you

32:11.960 --> 32:18.680
walk. What do we want? 100% raise. When do we want it? By next Friday, because that's pretty soon.

32:20.040 --> 32:25.000
As soon as it can be, you know, matriculated through the payment system. Gotta go through

32:25.000 --> 32:29.160
HR and I understand that's a long process, but as soon as possible, please money. And then,

32:30.120 --> 32:34.280
and that's not a good chant, but it will, it will have a good effect. I have a,

32:34.280 --> 32:39.000
a problem with severe awkwardness. Um, and now a question.

32:39.000 --> 32:43.800
No, I have a problem with severe awkwardness. I feel awkward for people on television and they get

32:43.800 --> 32:48.840
into awkward situations. I also have trouble conversing on the phone. I hear it ringing and

32:48.840 --> 32:56.440
I go hide until it stops. You know, it can't see you. I often try to diffuse awkward situations by

32:56.440 --> 33:01.720
jokingly stating, well, this is awkward. Okay. That's not helping. There's all kinds of ways

33:01.720 --> 33:05.720
we're going to be able to help you, but let me finish the question. The only problem is I'm

33:05.720 --> 33:13.640
usually the only one feeling awkward. Me stating that makes the other resulting in me feeling

33:13.640 --> 33:17.880
even more awkward. How can I stop feeling so damn awkward all the time? And this is from,

33:17.880 --> 33:22.840
of course, awkward person. It's like a, it's like a snail shell. It's all just so recursive. Like

33:23.880 --> 33:28.440
you're your own worst enemy in these, in these situations. Like maybe you're just like constantly

33:28.440 --> 33:33.240
afraid that you'll accidentally drop a racial slur. Like maybe that's what you're super afraid of.

33:33.240 --> 33:39.320
Maybe that's what you're super afraid of. Um, it's, it's really not a problem except you're

33:39.320 --> 33:44.760
making it so it's like thinking about kissing your dad. Let's, let's address this piece by piece

33:45.400 --> 33:49.960
feeling awkward for people on TV. I think we already addressed this in the home movie movie

33:49.960 --> 33:55.160
star question. They're not real people. Yeah. Don't, don't sweat it. I understand what you're

33:55.160 --> 34:00.200
saying. It happens to me too. Um, there's a name for it that I don't know who first started using

34:00.200 --> 34:06.440
but, but people call it wash off that feeling you get where you're like, Oh God, this is the worst.

34:07.080 --> 34:11.080
You got to just, I get it too. Like real bad. There's a lot of things I can't watch. Cause

34:11.080 --> 34:14.440
it's like, Oh, that's too. It makes it hard to watch the office. That's for sure. Oh yeah.

34:14.440 --> 34:19.480
God damn sure. See, I had to see an office. It doesn't bother me. Um, Griffin sent around this

34:19.480 --> 34:24.120
interview with Jake Lloyd. Oh my God. Little Anakin Skywalker all grown up. And it is the

34:24.120 --> 34:30.520
the worst thing I've ever seen. Cause it's like the, the interviewer wants him to be Anakin so

34:30.520 --> 34:36.040
bad. Like wants him to be this wreck and he is fighting it like with two things. No, I'm just,

34:36.040 --> 34:42.440
you know, I'm really into editing now. They get the interview. So you, uh, you keep in touch with

34:42.440 --> 34:49.160
any of the old cast bitch. Like I just, yeah, I called up my, I called Nat port the other day.

34:49.160 --> 34:55.800
I was taking on that. What's up? I want to come to the edit bay and chill. I got some hardies.

34:58.120 --> 35:02.440
That is just a type of entertainment that you don't enjoy. If you see that and it's happening,

35:02.440 --> 35:07.240
you got to get away from it. The phone, dude, I get it. I'm right there. I hate the phone too.

35:08.520 --> 35:13.800
I usually let every call go to voicemail unless it's like Travis or Griffin. Cause I don't want

35:13.800 --> 35:18.120
to deal with, I can't deal with it. But see, anyone who knows me well knows I don't, I don't

35:18.120 --> 35:23.160
make phone calls. If I can help it, I text message for that very reason text message.

35:23.160 --> 35:28.440
I can just say one sentence and I'm not going to get like trapped in a conversation when I really

35:28.440 --> 35:34.440
just needed to ask what time the party was at. As far as like the awkward in the situation,

35:34.440 --> 35:40.200
I get that. Cause like my sense of things being awkward is so finely tuned that I'm

35:41.160 --> 35:46.040
constantly thinking that things are awkward when they're not, um, that happens to me all the time.

35:46.040 --> 35:51.640
And I, the only solution I can give to you, cause I, I haven't cracked this particularly,

35:51.640 --> 35:57.560
not in my own life is to try to figure out what like the awkwardness fine, but try to get deeper

35:57.560 --> 36:01.960
and figure out like what it is that's upsetting you, like what it is that's making it seem awkward

36:01.960 --> 36:06.280
to you. And then try to deal with that. Cause a lot, cause I think awkward is like a symptom.

36:06.280 --> 36:10.440
Like for me, when I feel awkward, I usually just, it's that I'm worried about looking stupid.

36:10.440 --> 36:13.480
That's exactly what it is. I'm worried about saying the wrong thing.

36:13.480 --> 36:17.560
It's not an emotion, right? It's not like a causal thing. Like awkwardness. It's like,

36:17.560 --> 36:22.840
it's like fear. Like you, you have it. It's, it's something that you create based on the

36:22.840 --> 36:27.560
situation that you're in. It's possible to never feel awkward your entire life. If you just like,

36:27.560 --> 36:32.680
if you run into an awkward situation, like you make a joke about somebody's brother and they're

36:32.680 --> 36:37.480
like, oh, my brother's dead. Then you just got to like, you can feel awkward or you can, you can,

36:37.480 --> 36:40.600
you know, try and play it back, try and roll that ball back.

36:40.600 --> 36:45.480
I think what you should keep in mind is situations are not awkward. People are awkward.

36:46.040 --> 36:51.480
Like the situation is not inherently anything. It is your interpretation of the situation that

36:51.480 --> 36:57.080
makes it awkward. So, and I know that everyone's going to immediately come up with some situation

36:57.080 --> 37:01.400
in their head and be like, but what about this? That's inherently awkward. Well, no, that's just

37:01.400 --> 37:07.240
everyone reacting to that makes that awkward. If everybody was just cool with it, it's not awkward.

37:07.240 --> 37:11.720
A lot of the times the way you get out of situations that are awkward is by acting like

37:11.720 --> 37:16.760
a phony. I'm like, I hate that. Cause like in my own day to day, I try to be really honest in my,

37:16.760 --> 37:23.560
in my interpersonal interactions. And I, and I, a lot of times you just got to do it though.

37:23.560 --> 37:28.600
You just gotta be like, say things you don't mean to get out of a rough situation. Yeah.

37:28.600 --> 37:36.360
I say, I say our new motto near my bim bam. No phonies. No phonies allowed. No phonies allowed.

37:36.360 --> 37:43.480
Hey phonies, Shane on you. Shane on your phonies. We're going to go back and edit in Shane actually

37:43.480 --> 37:49.080
saying it though. Yeah. You gotta stop saying, well, this is awkward. Like you, you have,

37:49.080 --> 37:55.720
you have to stop saying it. That is the action item. That's a bomb. That's like a bomb. When

37:55.720 --> 38:01.240
you say that you are making it awkward for everybody in like a two mile vicinity of you.

38:01.240 --> 38:05.720
Yeah. Hey Griffin, do you have like a cracker Jack Yahoo that you've been sitting on that

38:05.720 --> 38:12.760
you're just like, here, this is what I made for you. Something banging. I have a few. How about

38:12.760 --> 38:18.840
this one? This one was actually sent in by two people. Like they, one person sent it in and then

38:18.840 --> 38:24.280
another person sent it in like an hour later, which is insane. It's, it was sent in by Lulz

38:24.280 --> 38:32.280
to miss prime and Patrick toy. Thank you. You too. It's by Yahoo answers user, a great white shark.

38:32.280 --> 38:39.880
Uh, usually whenever I read these, like I try to like just read it in a very, uh, just my standard,

38:39.880 --> 38:45.160
you know, voice. Uh, I try to enunciate and make it clear. I think I have like a certain voice.

38:45.160 --> 38:49.560
I've gone back and listened to old episodes and I do definitely have a voice when I do these,

38:49.560 --> 38:56.040
but I think for this one, um, maybe we should read it in the style of like the person who actually

38:56.040 --> 39:00.840
wrote it. Like what I imagined him sounding like. Is this going to be horrifically racist?

39:00.840 --> 39:07.160
Uh, no. Okay. Does drinking tea make my dick bigger?

39:10.680 --> 39:15.880
Tea has many health benefits. Is this one of them? I noticed a difference lately.

39:15.880 --> 39:23.720
This is just my imagination. Whoa, let's go. I don't know what I've been slurping that

39:23.720 --> 39:32.680
chamomile down like crazy. Is that I've got extra thickness and half down there. Is it the tea?

39:34.040 --> 39:39.560
It's like a hefty thick. Are you not peeing? Like, is that the problem? Well, I'm like,

39:39.560 --> 39:45.400
do so big and it's purple and I want to black out. Why did I drink so much tea? They're right.

39:45.400 --> 39:50.280
This is not a sipping tea. This is a gulping tea because if you sip it, your dick won't get big

39:50.280 --> 40:04.840
as fast. Maybe he just has tea boners. He just loves the tea. This chai boner.

40:06.760 --> 40:11.000
I had someone say to me the other day that they, like we were having a conversation about boners

40:11.000 --> 40:15.960
like you do and they said, oh yeah. And like, you know, when guys get bored, so they get boners

40:16.760 --> 40:19.720
and I was like, what? That's not a thing. That doesn't happen.

40:19.720 --> 40:24.280
What? When I get bored, I just want to check that that's true for everyone,

40:24.280 --> 40:26.280
right? That there's never time like, I'm still bored.

40:30.440 --> 40:37.400
I get boners in two. There are two things. Two catalysts, two boner catalysts.

40:37.400 --> 40:45.320
Tea. It's yeah, tea and things that are sexy. Yeah, right. If I get, if I see both, like if I,

40:45.320 --> 40:49.320
uh, if I'm drinking tea and like a lady drops something nearby.

40:49.880 --> 40:55.720
Oh boy. Or if she drops a tea bag. Oh boy.

40:56.600 --> 41:01.080
If I wasn't so bored right now. Yeah, you'd be in trouble.

41:02.200 --> 41:10.600
Um, uh, no, no, he does not. He does not. Can you imagine like the UK like, oh my God,

41:10.600 --> 41:15.400
it's how they would do. Well, all they do is just compare their half. The trick is not if you drink

41:15.400 --> 41:20.440
it, you gotta pour it right on there. You just pour it boiling hot when it's straight out,

41:20.440 --> 41:24.600
boiling hot, just dump it right on there. That was actually the plot of the fourth

41:24.600 --> 41:30.840
Austin Powers movie. They abandoned it. Dick tea, dick tea, tea on his dick.

41:31.480 --> 41:35.960
Yahoo answers user JD responded. Hell yeah. That's all I drink and I'm packing.

41:35.960 --> 41:44.120
Is it maybe like maybe like maybe big dick gentlemen are drawn to see because they can,

41:44.120 --> 41:48.440
it's like a, it's like a reverse Corvette sort of thing. Like I don't care. I drink tea.

41:48.440 --> 41:54.280
It's like a snail shell. It's re it's recursive. I, are you, is it like a snail shell? It's like

41:54.280 --> 42:02.200
the spruce goose is spruce goose made of snow shells. Um, guys, I gotta say I drink coffee

42:02.200 --> 42:09.320
like exclusively. Am I, am I missing out on a, an opportunity to, I'm actually sipping a delicious

42:09.320 --> 42:15.880
Earl gray right now and enjoying my massive boner. Oh man. Patrick Stewart's boner out of this world.

42:15.880 --> 42:19.080
Forget about it. Get it out of this world.

42:23.240 --> 42:27.480
Uh, if you don't drink tea, then you're, you'll just have another down there. There's nothing

42:27.480 --> 42:35.080
you gotta get up on tea. It gives you a bigger wang. Um, don't put honey in it. Don't put sugar

42:35.080 --> 42:39.320
in it. Cause that's, that's counterintuitive. Don't put honey on it and don't put sugar on it

42:39.320 --> 42:44.680
because that is sticky. You're not going to enjoy that. Uh, that's not going to help the size,

42:44.680 --> 42:49.800
the size issue either. Um, in December I will be performing for the first time on stage in

42:49.800 --> 42:53.720
my school's theater production, knowing that at least one member of your Trinity has knowledge

42:53.720 --> 42:59.240
of the performing arts. Is there anything I can expect from my chosen extracurricular activity?

42:59.240 --> 43:04.360
Also, is there an easy way to cope with the often indignant? Oh, you're in the musical remarks.

43:05.400 --> 43:11.080
Thanks for the knowledge dropping, John. Oh, John, you're in such luck. You're in such luck.

43:11.080 --> 43:18.680
All three parts of this Trinity, uh, have been in. Yeah. Yeah. We've been in sound of music.

43:18.680 --> 43:27.720
You, hello, Dolly. I'm proud of it. Yeah. Uh, well, John, everybody in theater is secret gay.

43:27.720 --> 43:38.200
Now, hold on. The people who are in theater are embracing that secret gay side of them.

43:38.200 --> 43:44.680
The person that the people that make fun of people in theater, um, are, are the ones who

43:44.680 --> 43:52.920
are secret self hating gay. Um, like you look at us. We, last week we talked a lot of yay about

43:52.920 --> 43:58.200
furries, but to cover up the fact that we are all right now as we record the show wearing free

43:58.200 --> 44:07.240
costumes. That is true. What do you guys show? I've ever recorded. I'm a, I'm a sexy cow. Um,

44:07.240 --> 44:15.080
I am an apologetic tiger because I feel bad to our furry friends. I feel wicked bad. Like,

44:15.080 --> 44:20.840
not like our furry friends, like forest creatures. I mean like friends that are furry. I, I,

44:20.840 --> 44:24.680
here's, here's the thing. Let's, let's put this question on pause. We'll get back to it.

44:24.680 --> 44:32.280
Cause we need to address this. I think that hatred comes from fear and fear comes from a

44:32.280 --> 44:39.560
lack of understanding and fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. I learned so much about

44:39.560 --> 44:44.120
that community in this past week from people who sent an email. I was like, Hey, I wish you hadn't

44:44.120 --> 44:50.120
have said, um, that you wish I would die in a fire. Like maybe we did jump the gun a little

44:50.120 --> 44:58.440
bit in that respect, but I guess there are people who are, who enjoy like that idea of people with,

44:58.440 --> 45:05.640
with animal heads and fur and shit. Um, but not in like, not like a sexy man fox,

45:05.640 --> 45:11.320
just railing on a lady rabbit. Like maybe there's no sex involved in it at all. It's just like an

45:11.320 --> 45:18.360
aspect of nerd culture. The sexy ones are called yip yippers, right? I have no idea. I did learn

45:18.360 --> 45:24.440
a new term. Um, uh, there's a, uh, someone on our forums who is a, who's a furry. He goes by

45:24.440 --> 45:33.000
the name root. Um, and he, he jokingly referred to us as first executioners, which I thought was

45:33.000 --> 45:38.440
great. The community's most, the most valuable thing they have about them is their portmanteaus.

45:38.440 --> 45:45.000
They will drop them like nobody's business. I guess like only like five percent of that

45:45.000 --> 45:51.240
community actually dresses up like animals and, um, bones down on each other. So, so like,

45:51.240 --> 45:55.560
I think we, we made some assumptions last week and for that I am, I'm truly sorry.

45:55.560 --> 45:58.280
Justin Perdue I am sorry too. Now, John, now Secret

45:58.280 --> 46:04.440
Gate John, that's a whole other thing. You, if you're in the musical, people are going to think

46:04.440 --> 46:12.040
what they're going to think. Um, you have got to focus on the things that are not those people,

46:12.040 --> 46:17.160
like the magic of the stage, the smell of the grease paint, the roar of the crowd,

46:17.160 --> 46:24.760
the thrill of the footlights as they, they create a path for you to Broadway glory. Um,

46:24.760 --> 46:26.440
that's the kind of thing you need to be focused on.

46:26.440 --> 46:28.760
Justin Perdue Do you have your tap right? You got to get

46:28.760 --> 46:29.240
your tap right.

46:29.240 --> 46:43.680
John

46:43.680 --> 46:50.600
Yeah, you, you know what, you know what's up. Um, okay. And when your friends or you're not

46:50.600 --> 46:55.960
friends give you shit about being in the musical, explain to them that there are also women in the

46:55.960 --> 47:01.160
musical that you get to hang out with backstage and drop words like dressing rooms. Yeah.

47:01.160 --> 47:05.880
Justin Perdue That's an infantile way of winning.

47:05.880 --> 47:08.200
Justin Perdue Yeah, I peep. I peep dressing rooms.

47:08.200 --> 47:13.160
Justin Perdue I saw so many bras, checked out a lot of bras

47:13.160 --> 47:18.200
during, you should see all the bras in the room. John, I, I'm going to help you out with this

47:18.200 --> 47:22.760
seriously. This is the serious, we're going to deal with this problem together. We're at a point

47:22.760 --> 47:29.320
in our society and our history where, um, being a homosexual person is not something to be derided.

47:30.200 --> 47:35.480
Um, it's, it's not something to be like hated or judged or feared or anything. It's just

47:35.480 --> 47:42.360
a way people are. If you deal with people like that, then you are going to elevate that

47:42.360 --> 47:47.720
conversation. You are going to win that every time. If you say, well, no, I'm, um, I just like

47:47.720 --> 47:53.160
performing in musicals, but what would be wrong with it if I was gay? Oh, you could, oh boy.

47:53.160 --> 47:56.200
Justin Perdue Straight up say, oh no, I just actually enjoy

47:56.200 --> 47:58.600
expressing myself and don't have to belittle others.

47:58.600 --> 48:01.960
Justin Perdue Yeah. Yeah. Like that. And then it kind of

48:01.960 --> 48:05.480
sounds like the end of a scene from full house, but I think you should try it.

48:05.480 --> 48:07.240
Jared Polin But in like a full house episode where like

48:07.240 --> 48:10.200
Michelle's like, Hey, go fuck yourself, bigot. Like,

48:10.200 --> 48:12.280
Justin Perdue Yeah, right. Right.

48:12.280 --> 48:14.360
Jared Polin Uncle Joey, that was awful. What you just

48:14.360 --> 48:17.400
said. Fucking bigot. Cut it out.

48:17.400 --> 48:21.160
Justin Perdue Cut it out, bigot. Comet, you fucking racist.

48:21.160 --> 48:26.600
Comet was a racist. Joey was a bigot. Danny, uh, really into S and M.

48:26.600 --> 48:29.320
Jared Polin No, you're ruining it.

48:29.320 --> 48:32.440
Justin Perdue Uncle Jesse a furry, but like not like a

48:32.440 --> 48:32.840
cool one.

48:32.840 --> 48:35.000
Jared Polin But like a cool one. He didn't dress up like

48:35.000 --> 48:38.440
it, but even if you dress up like it, guys, to get back on that point,

48:38.440 --> 48:40.280
Justin Perdue To get back on furry.

48:40.280 --> 48:43.400
Jared Polin Don't listen to us. Like if you if you want

48:43.400 --> 48:48.600
to dress up like a sexy raccoon, like just do it. Don't let anyone, even us, tell you

48:48.600 --> 48:53.560
not to do it. Like we're uncomfortable with it, but fuck it. Fuck it. Maybe we're bigots.

48:53.560 --> 48:57.000
Who knows? Just do it. Just do what you want to do. Don't listen to anyone ever.

48:57.000 --> 48:59.480
Justin Perdue Maybe we're secret furries. Who knows?

48:59.480 --> 49:01.720
Jared Polin Just don't be a phony about it.

49:01.720 --> 49:02.360
Justin Perdue Secret furries.

49:02.360 --> 49:04.680
Jared Polin Do not be a phony whatever you do.

49:04.680 --> 49:08.200
Justin Perdue No, no phonies allowed.

49:08.200 --> 49:09.560
Jared Polin MPH.

49:09.560 --> 49:11.000
Justin Perdue MPH.

49:11.000 --> 49:13.560
Jared Polin Wait, I spelled that wrong. MPA. Damn it.

49:13.560 --> 49:16.440
Jared Polin Oh, you tried your best. You tried.

49:16.440 --> 49:18.360
Justin Perdue I was thinking of Neil Patrick Harris.

49:18.360 --> 49:21.800
Jared Polin Yeah. Yeah. John gets derided, but Travis is

49:21.800 --> 49:25.400
having Freudian slips on Neil Patrick Harris. And John's the gay one.

49:25.400 --> 49:29.000
Jared Polin Now, keep in mind, we're saying no phonies

49:29.000 --> 49:33.320
allowed. Ponies, totally okay. Or people who dress up like ponies.

49:33.320 --> 49:34.760
Justin Perdue I want to hear.

49:34.760 --> 49:35.320
Jared Polin That's cool, too.

49:35.320 --> 49:37.240
Justin Perdue I want to hear Griffin's last question,

49:37.240 --> 49:42.200
but we have a couple of little housekeeping things. First off,

49:43.240 --> 49:48.040
one of our biggest talent week ever last week, just from you guys talking about the show,

49:48.040 --> 49:54.360
tweeting about it, voting about it. Not voting about it, just voting for it in various forums,

49:54.360 --> 49:59.320
reviewing it, critiquing it, talking it up. It's just because of you guys. We are so, so, so, so,

49:59.320 --> 50:07.400
so grateful. We are this week rolling out a new line.

50:07.400 --> 50:09.000
Jared Polin Are we sure it's this week?

50:09.000 --> 50:12.040
Justin Perdue I'm almost positive that it will be this

50:12.040 --> 50:20.840
week. Our buddy Sean at Ninja Bot told me that he would have it ready for today when the show goes

50:20.840 --> 50:28.360
live. But it may, you know, maybe it'll be Tuesday, but it'll definitely be this week. A new line from

50:28.360 --> 50:35.720
my brother, my brother and me, gear, merchandise. We have five items, I think, for you.

50:35.720 --> 50:38.120
Jared Polin Lady shirt, red shirt with the logo.

50:39.880 --> 50:43.160
We have the brown shirt with the pack your bags. We have the coffee mug.

50:43.160 --> 50:47.480
Justin Perdue And we have a hooded sweatshirt

50:48.120 --> 50:55.480
that will be navy blue. And we're doing something kind of neat with that. All our profits from the

50:55.480 --> 50:59.960
hooded, we always invest the stuff we make back into the show to try to make the show better and

50:59.960 --> 51:08.440
more popular and more enjoyable for you. But on the hooded sweatshirt, we are going to donate all

51:08.440 --> 51:15.160
of our profits to Big Brothers Big Sisters, which we thought was a thematically appropriate charity.

51:15.160 --> 51:18.040
Jared Polin Because some people, some people ain't got brothers.

51:18.040 --> 51:20.200
Justin Perdue Yeah, that's a fact. It's a fact. We're going

51:20.200 --> 51:26.520
to pay for brothers. It is a you're making a donation to buy a brother for someone. But

51:27.080 --> 51:31.000
if you want those, make sure you preorder them because we're only making as many sweatshirts

51:31.640 --> 51:38.600
as as we preorder. So if you if you want stuff for Christmas, like this is the round to get it in and

51:38.600 --> 51:43.240
you want to guarantee you're going to get something you want to preorder with this round. If you want

51:43.240 --> 51:46.760
to buy something for that special somebody or want them to buy something for you, make sure

51:46.760 --> 51:51.560
tell them to do it like right away. We'll keep some extras of the other stuff in stock. But

51:51.560 --> 51:56.280
the sweatshirt you need to preorder if you want it. And then like I said, all money for that goes

51:56.280 --> 51:59.960
to Brothers Big Sisters. So it's a good good cause. You're helping to people see you wearing that

51:59.960 --> 52:05.080
they know that you've got not only a warm torso, but a warm heart as well.

52:05.080 --> 52:07.480
Jared Polin They'll also think you're rich because it

52:07.480 --> 52:13.080
will be expensive. Like as far as like garments go, it will cost a premium, but you're helping.

52:13.080 --> 52:15.720
Justin Perdue Not not not actually talk to not a crazy amount.

52:15.720 --> 52:20.520
Not it's not going to be. No, not like. Yeah. No, no, God, no, nothing like that.

52:22.040 --> 52:25.640
But anyway, all that stuff is going to be on the site. So make sure you check it out.

52:25.640 --> 52:28.120
Jared Polin Also wanted to thank everyone on Twitter.

52:29.240 --> 52:33.800
You know, not only for mentioning the show, telling your friends, spreading the love,

52:33.800 --> 52:38.040
but apparently there's some stuff going on at podcast awards.com.

52:38.040 --> 52:40.360
Justin Perdue Apparently the Academy.

52:42.520 --> 52:43.240
Thank thank you.

52:43.240 --> 52:44.040
Jared Polin Yeah.

52:44.040 --> 52:44.680
Justin Perdue Thanks for that.

52:44.680 --> 52:46.200
Jared Polin Well, we do appreciate it. You guys are great.

52:46.200 --> 52:49.960
Justin Perdue Yeah. Thanks, as always, to Bob Ball,

52:51.160 --> 52:57.320
who reads our comes over to my house every Monday and reads the announcement, the disclaimer at the

52:57.320 --> 52:57.560
beginning.

52:57.560 --> 53:00.600
Jared Polin Super inconvenient for him. Like he lives on the other side of the nation.

53:00.600 --> 53:01.560
Justin Perdue He's making it really.

53:01.560 --> 53:04.520
Jared Polin And also, if you haven't done so already,

53:04.520 --> 53:10.200
get down on those forums. Get over there. Things are happening and you want to be able to say that

53:10.200 --> 53:15.640
you got in there on the ground floor. We have hundreds of people there talking, chatting,

53:15.640 --> 53:19.800
learning, living, loving, growing, and you do not want to miss out on that.

53:19.800 --> 53:22.040
Jared Polin I learned. This week I learned about

53:22.040 --> 53:26.680
furries in the furry community. There's a difference between furries and fursuiters.

53:27.240 --> 53:30.840
Guys, it's happening over there. It's like school. It's like college over there.

53:30.840 --> 53:33.800
Justin Perdue It's a learning opportunity. Thanks also to

53:33.800 --> 53:39.800
everybody who mentioned us this week on the Twitter, Gaming Savant and

53:42.520 --> 53:43.720
Chrissy23Cherissy.

53:43.720 --> 53:47.400
Jared Polin I don't know. HybridMisfit just gave us a

53:47.400 --> 53:48.600
shout out. Thanks, HybridMisfit.

53:48.600 --> 53:49.640
Justin Perdue Yeah. What's up?

53:49.640 --> 53:52.040
Jared Polin So, okay. Oh, and we straight up got a

53:52.040 --> 53:56.840
mention from a girl with a porn site. Made me really happy. Iona Grace.

53:56.840 --> 53:59.320
Jared Polin Wow. That's awesome.

53:59.320 --> 54:00.200
Justin Perdue I thought so.

54:00.200 --> 54:02.680
Jared Polin Hey, should we talk about that, DJ?

54:02.680 --> 54:05.320
Justin Perdue Oh, yeah. What's up with that? What's

54:05.320 --> 54:05.880
the story there?

54:05.880 --> 54:09.080
Jared Polin We got an email from this DJ who goes by the

54:09.080 --> 54:19.400
name Rocky Horror. He takes mixtapes. He makes mixtapes based on themes. He made one on Lost,

54:19.400 --> 54:25.720
which I guess mixes homespun jams with cuts, lines from Lost.

54:25.720 --> 54:26.600
Justin Perdue Like deep cuts?

54:26.600 --> 54:28.360
Jared Polin Like deep, deep cuts from Lost,

54:28.360 --> 54:33.160
but of people talking. But each mixtape has a theme, and he wants to do one based on my brother,

54:33.160 --> 54:38.280
my brother and me. So he's going to be touring with that and just spinning it in the clubs,

54:38.280 --> 54:45.240
in the warehouse raves. So if we can just riff for 30 seconds, give him dope things to say.

54:45.960 --> 54:49.960
We need to say his name, Rocky Horror, and his co-DJ, Bird Flu.

54:49.960 --> 54:50.840
Justin Perdue Okay.

54:50.840 --> 54:52.760
Jared Polin We have to fit that into it somehow, but we

54:52.760 --> 54:57.400
