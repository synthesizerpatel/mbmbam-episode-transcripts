00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:44.320
It's a new craze, and good girls do you wanna? Just say, hey I wanna. Just say, hey I wanna.

00:44.320 --> 00:46.720
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother and my brother mean advice show for the

00:46.720 --> 00:52.080
modern era. I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy. I am, at least according to my birth

00:52.080 --> 00:59.600
certificate, your middle-est brother Travis McElroy. I'm Griffin McElroy. Summer's here.

00:59.600 --> 01:04.560
What? Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot. The hot season is here, summer. Check the thermostat.

01:05.120 --> 01:10.720
The beaches have sand, and you know what that means. The drinks have ice. Then it's summer

01:10.720 --> 01:20.480
stuff all over. And May flowers bring June powers. Sun power? Sun powers. What are the songs of the

01:20.480 --> 01:28.240
summer? Well shit, I mean it's, I don't know that we're far enough in because I like to think that

01:28.240 --> 01:32.480
mid-July is when the Black Eyed Peas are finally gonna get their shit together. You think they're

01:32.480 --> 01:38.480
finally gonna get it going? Middle of July is what I expect. I think they're gonna get together.

01:38.480 --> 01:43.760
They're gonna do the, you know, theme song to a big, the new Spider-Man is gonna have a Black

01:43.760 --> 01:49.040
Eyed Peas joint as the theme song, and it's gonna be partially about Spider-Man, but also about how

01:49.040 --> 01:52.800
good it feels when you're together with your friends having a party. Yeah, something about

01:52.800 --> 02:03.120
like let's, let's party responsibly. I have been, uh, to try to get the, um, the pulse of this. I've

02:03.120 --> 02:11.440
been enjoying, um, NBC's Songland, a show where the woman who wrote Super Bass and the young boy from

02:13.120 --> 02:20.480
One Republic and another gentleman with a beard and a guitar help young songwriters make the next

02:20.480 --> 02:30.000
big hits for today's artists, and I was watching an episode with Jonas Brothers, uh, tried to create

02:30.000 --> 02:37.520
their song, uh, Greenlight with a new, um, a new song named Able Heart, right? And so they have their

02:37.520 --> 02:45.760
choice of songs to pick, okay? Um, and that this song includes lyrics like, um, just say I got the

02:45.760 --> 02:51.760
green light the things we do past midnight just me and you and it feels right just an empty room

02:51.760 --> 03:00.080
and the green light and it it I just can't help thinking about so another bit they say before you

03:00.080 --> 03:06.080
come around yeah I was feeling blue so tell me if you're down and I'll fly you to the moon got me

03:06.080 --> 03:12.160
begging you for more yeah it's nothing new ain't nobody in the world does it like you do I just

03:12.160 --> 03:17.760
can't help every time I would they would start to improvise about this song about fucking I can't

03:17.760 --> 03:24.400
help but think about yeah that's the thing it's not about stock car race no sir it's about sex

03:24.400 --> 03:30.480
and every time I think about it I just think about how these men these men who are brothers in much

03:30.480 --> 03:37.600
the same way that we are brothers are like well guys let's fucking pump that song about sex will

03:37.600 --> 03:43.840
you harmonize with me my brother on this song about how we get down with people can we do that

03:43.840 --> 03:52.080
together as brothers together at the same time we'll sing the same thing in this song about pure

03:52.080 --> 03:59.200
sex joe what rhymes with juices on my fat hog let me get my rhyming dictionary

04:01.440 --> 04:04.960
joe you know how it is whenever you get you know the good stuff

04:04.960 --> 04:13.680
uh-huh you know joe hey joe is it is it four or five r's in jerk because I want to get it right

04:13.680 --> 04:19.440
for the song our new number one single it's not the thing to get hung up on in the lyrics you

04:19.440 --> 04:27.600
just described but why is empty room invoked there that's not sexy in the original version

04:27.600 --> 04:33.120
of the lyrics they the the gentleman even says like don't need a bed like we don't need a bed

04:33.120 --> 04:41.680
i think you probably do if someone said hey come have sex with me and i said yes i am interested

04:41.680 --> 04:47.840
and then they led me into a room that was just ceiling and floor and like four bare walls

04:47.840 --> 04:55.280
they're gonna dexter me yeah yeah yeah all the lock star exterior green light um i don't think

04:55.280 --> 05:01.600
that i could sing that song i mean we talk about a lot of adult content here i guess that's true

05:01.600 --> 05:06.720
true not in an earnest way when you're writing that people will put us on in the background

05:06.720 --> 05:12.160
to make love well that yeah it's not a seductive show entertainment weekly has actually named us

05:12.160 --> 05:16.880
four years running the least seductive podcast in the business just try to have sex while you

05:16.880 --> 05:22.400
listen to my brother my brother impossible can't do it can't just can't get the rhythm going

05:23.600 --> 05:27.920
yeah that is what most people will always be legal as long as my brother my brother and me

05:27.920 --> 05:33.520
is legal to be downloaded yes because it is impossible but with our anti-sex with our

05:33.520 --> 05:38.560
fucking twisted south park humor who knows before they shut us down that's true they have been

05:38.560 --> 05:43.120
talking a lot about shutting us down lately they're always trying to come for us but no one

05:43.120 --> 05:50.800
else is coming for us the um the preview of the uh the next next week's episode i'm extremely

05:50.800 --> 05:57.120
excited about because the songwriters the young songwriters for next week's episode

05:57.120 --> 06:03.120
are going to be working with aloe black to create a song for the soundtrack of fast and furious

06:03.120 --> 06:09.520
presents hobbs and shaw so that is a massive opportunity but wait just a huge opportunity

06:09.520 --> 06:15.120
i would love it's probably too late to get in on the filming of that isn't that movie already done

06:16.000 --> 06:20.880
yeah but at the end it's just going to be like boop do do do do do i don't know i haven't heard

06:20.880 --> 06:28.160
this song yet here's a song about hugging hobbs and shaw hobbs and shaw saving lives by breaking

06:28.160 --> 06:34.400
the law people say that you're fast and i'm too furious but i know that is claim is spurious it's

06:34.400 --> 06:39.760
the other way around i am the quick one and you are the one with a quick trigger on the gun fast

06:39.760 --> 06:46.640
and furious hobbs and shaw don't know anybody who's not loving y'all in the box office you're

06:46.640 --> 06:53.760
the number one everybody come and hold this gun it takes a village i hold this gun

06:55.520 --> 06:57.680
indris elba is in this one

07:00.560 --> 07:09.680
we've done it songland al aloe please call us uh we're ready to get started this is an advice show

07:09.680 --> 07:15.200
and we do questions do you want to do one i would love that griffin thank you you read my mind i was

07:15.200 --> 07:19.360
i was about to segue into it because i felt that energy going that way but of course you and your

07:19.360 --> 07:23.120
infinite wisdom you sense the energy going that way just a split second justin's looking for the

07:23.120 --> 07:29.520
question i just i have heard it been said that any internship remains unpaid as long as you don't

07:29.520 --> 07:34.480
steal enough stuff from the company i actually have a pretty well-paid internship in an office

07:34.480 --> 07:38.960
but i still want to take the lamp from my desk when i leave the position okay i've done my

07:38.960 --> 07:45.920
research and this desk lamp is valued at 50 it's a special brand damn that's a good lamp it's a

07:45.920 --> 07:49.840
special brand that mimics natural sunlight so artists who work with color have a more honest

07:49.840 --> 07:55.600
relationship with their art but it's a good lamp this lamp i like the phrasing of that like this

07:55.600 --> 08:02.080
lamp makes me able to date my painting this lamp does not belong in a cubicle hidden around the

08:02.080 --> 08:08.880
computer for the next intern to not totally appreciate as a hobbyist artist the lamp belongs

08:08.880 --> 08:13.680
with me how do i steal something this large from my internship or is there a more chill way to ask

08:13.680 --> 08:20.240
for it that's from lamp lust in little saigon damn this person's got it all figured out i

08:20.240 --> 08:25.440
wish i was this confident about any of my life decisions first of all i would like to address

08:25.440 --> 08:30.720
the first sentence and maybe it's just i haven't worked enough internships but i have never heard

08:30.720 --> 08:35.920
it been said that any internship remains a pain as long as you haven't stolen enough

08:36.800 --> 08:43.680
yeah as has been said by me here in this sentence in this question to you uh here's a chill way

08:44.320 --> 08:52.400
okay ask your boss do you mind if i move this lamp oh good oh that's so good that's really

08:52.400 --> 08:57.440
good and non-specific yeah you leave that what now listen this is risky because if your boss

08:57.440 --> 09:07.840
says move it where and you say my home the jig is up i think that if you asked for the lamp as

09:07.840 --> 09:14.800
you're walking out the door on your last day it would be so disconcerting i think for lack of a

09:14.800 --> 09:21.760
better word it would be so jarring that the person might just say like yeah um yes yes and then you're

09:21.760 --> 09:28.480
gone like you're already out the door um but at that point it's a huge risk right because that's

09:28.480 --> 09:34.240
you're waiting to the last minute with my plan so it may if they say no there you're out of options

09:34.240 --> 09:39.440
here's what i'll say here's another uh way to ensure success here ask it like this and it's

09:39.440 --> 09:46.160
cool if i take this lamp right so good travis damn and you don't even need you don't even need

09:46.160 --> 09:51.280
something to come before the end but the implication is like we've had a whole conversation

09:51.280 --> 09:55.760
about the cool things that will happen when i leave and this is one even better just sort

09:55.760 --> 10:01.040
of hold it up in front of your boss and say it's cool right you know what let's shorten and just

10:01.040 --> 10:09.280
say huh cool yes um you could say hey i'm gonna steal two of these lamps and your boss is gonna

10:09.280 --> 10:16.320
be like no you're not and you'd be like you're right just the one could can you can you maybe

10:16.320 --> 10:21.360
go with like i loved this job was sort of like the best things ever happened to me and i really

10:22.000 --> 10:28.560
treasure it and want to remember it and i'm gonna go ahead and take this lamp to remember all of

10:28.560 --> 10:35.200
you because you were a light that lit up my yes yes you're the light in my life and this is now

10:35.200 --> 10:42.000
the light in my apartment if i maybe just say like i brought this lamp from home and when your boss

10:42.000 --> 10:45.840
is like but it's like all the other lamps and you say that's why i brought it in because it reminded

10:45.840 --> 10:50.960
me of all the other lamps oh see i was gonna say you could bring in another lamp and just swap them

10:50.960 --> 10:56.400
indie indie style swap them but they would notice that you're taking the lamp that looks exactly

10:56.400 --> 11:05.600
like all the other lamps and you left a garfield light up lamp that you found in your sister's room

11:05.600 --> 11:12.640
that's not great so uh you're gonna need to start bringing a really large felt puppet to work with

11:12.640 --> 11:19.680
you now now and start getting everybody comfortable and not only comfortable accustomed to the idea

11:19.680 --> 11:26.240
that you always bring this huge huge felt puppet with you uh that keeps you company in your cubicle

11:26.880 --> 11:31.680
uh that you have conversations with it when you needed you know to blow off some steam

11:31.680 --> 11:38.400
or talk about the new episode of game of thrones that hbo is sending directly to you uh and then

11:38.400 --> 11:42.720
once everybody sort of appreciates the fact oh well that's just you know their big big felt

11:42.720 --> 11:47.120
puppet you'll know by the way the the key there will be when you don't have the puppet if someone

11:47.120 --> 11:52.880
says hey where's the puppet now yes now you know you're in the clear to stuff that fucking lamp

11:52.880 --> 11:58.160
right up in that puppet and carry it out and it's never even been a thing and you know what the you

11:58.160 --> 12:08.560
know why that's such a good idea why why because there's nothing else you could put the lamp in i

12:08.560 --> 12:13.120
want to describe a bit of prop comedy that you could do here to get away with this and i want

12:13.120 --> 12:18.240
you to really don't interrupt me but i want you to close your eyes even if you're driving especially

12:18.240 --> 12:23.840
if you're driving and and really imagine this okay as you're walking out they're applauding

12:23.840 --> 12:28.800
as you're walking on your last day say i just want to let everybody know that this internship

12:28.800 --> 12:35.920
has given me a really bright idea and then you hold the lamp above your head about what i want

12:35.920 --> 12:42.880
to do with my future and then you keep the lamp above your head and slowly back out the door and

12:42.880 --> 12:48.240
they will be so confused as to what is happening or laughing their asses off laughing their asses

12:48.240 --> 12:53.360
off thank you griffin yeah absolutely like losing it with this great prop comedy you did

12:53.360 --> 12:58.080
that they won't even think like he'll they'll assume that you'll bring it back that will be

12:58.080 --> 13:02.000
the assumption that's made is that you'll be bringing it back at your earliest convenience

13:03.040 --> 13:07.840
also get a big parachute tie it to the lamp throw it right out the freaking window

13:08.720 --> 13:13.520
first floor this isn't great if you're on the first floor it's not great just thank you you

13:13.520 --> 13:18.400
kind of do need it to get to terminal velocity but if you're on the first floor it's not a problem

13:18.400 --> 13:22.960
yeah i would say the first floor is probably fine second third and fourth it's probably an

13:22.960 --> 13:28.080
issue but fifth you probably have enough yeah there's four floors there where it's no good

13:28.080 --> 13:35.760
or you really need the wind to sort of pick up maybe tie the lamp use fishing line yes they

13:35.760 --> 13:39.280
can't see it tie it to your belt buckle so it looks like it's hopping behind you and just

13:39.280 --> 13:45.200
keep saying like come on come on and they'll be like the lamp wanted to be with them the lamp

13:45.200 --> 13:51.840
chose them over us okay i know this internship has given me a really bright idea then you hold

13:51.840 --> 13:55.680
it above your head right and then you put it back down and you say about what i want to do

13:55.680 --> 14:01.440
with my future i'm gonna be a lamp repairman and i'm gonna start with this guy right here

14:01.440 --> 14:06.480
and you just yank it out of the wall and walk out the door and they'll be like he's gonna be

14:06.480 --> 14:10.400
the greatest labor pair man ever because he's really dedicated to his craft there it is one

14:10.400 --> 14:14.720
of these certainly has to work certainly one of them i got a yahoo answer here that was sent in

14:14.720 --> 14:19.840
by jack thanks jack it's an anonymous yahoo answers user who i'm going to call theodore asks

14:19.840 --> 14:25.440
what i get laughed at if i call the living room the drawing room and the dining room the morning

14:25.440 --> 14:31.760
room and the kitchen the scullery i watch a lot of movies from the 40s so i've started to pick

14:31.760 --> 14:36.320
these things up and yes i'm aware the living room was called the parlor but i don't have a mansion

14:36.320 --> 14:44.240
what i'm so there's there's so many things there well i mean i would rather have a drawing room

14:44.240 --> 14:51.360
than a parlor right because i you know me i'm always sketching something and it's true yeah so

14:51.360 --> 14:55.920
my plants my is that why it's called the drawing room maybe it's more like the drawing together

14:55.920 --> 15:03.280
of new ideas or perhaps where you might draw cards for a game of dude it's sketching doodles

15:03.280 --> 15:09.840
and doing fun cartoons uh yeah people love that shit back down in abby they were always just

15:09.840 --> 15:15.600
whipping up little you know ziggies uh just that little doodle where it looks like the guy with

15:15.600 --> 15:21.360
frizzy hair is poking his nose over the horizon what's his deal what's he hiding he even doing

15:21.360 --> 15:25.600
here's the thing that i think through me about the further details of this question griffin

15:25.600 --> 15:33.120
the question asker saying you're just picking up things like yeah like it's i don't know like you

15:33.120 --> 15:38.560
traveled abroad for two years and came back with a bit of an accent yeah also the 19th century

15:38.560 --> 15:46.960
yeah also the 1940s is really when these words came to power the 1940s during uh you know world

15:46.960 --> 15:54.240
war ii is when we really started calling shit the scullery uh i i'm no uh historian but i'd be

15:54.240 --> 16:00.080
willing to bet that basically for as long as you've been dining in it i think the dining

16:00.080 --> 16:05.360
room has been called the dining room no it's the morning room because you only eaten there in the

16:05.360 --> 16:10.640
morning anyway we're dodging the question and the answer to it is you're going to be made fun of so

16:10.640 --> 16:17.280
savagely uh you may actually die from it yes you may actually experience death from how bad the

16:17.280 --> 16:22.560
making fun of you is if you say if you call your kitchen the scullery and there's no amount of

16:22.560 --> 16:26.560
explaining a way that i feel like you can do to get over this one that's the big one because i

16:26.560 --> 16:31.280
think if you called your living room the drawing room even your family who loves you the most they

16:31.280 --> 16:37.520
would be like hmm that was weird okay that's fine and then you call the dining room the morning

16:37.520 --> 16:44.480
room they're probably gonna say do you mean the dining room but the second you say scullery it's

16:44.480 --> 16:53.600
done yeah it's done fetch me my pita chips from the larder and what are you fucking saying what

16:53.600 --> 17:02.400
do you mean how i i look at houses sometimes to kill the time until i die and i was on zillow and

17:02.400 --> 17:09.840
they i saw one house that had a room that was labeled popcorn room hell yeah i tried to google

17:09.840 --> 17:16.080
it and google had never heard of it so i don't know it must just be this person saying self-explanatory

17:16.080 --> 17:22.880
did you look with their photos nope no photos just a one label popcorn room i don't know if there

17:22.880 --> 17:27.600
were doors or not i guess there was a door but it was just labeled popcorn room did you put

17:27.600 --> 17:34.080
in an offer right i mean did you go in a little bit under asking oh shit no i did almost buy a

17:34.080 --> 17:39.760
house one time that when i was very young except i didn't have the money to do it but it did have

17:39.760 --> 17:44.960
a door hidden behind a bookshelf oh i've always really wanted that if you what do you think would

17:44.960 --> 17:49.440
be the hardest room to pull off saying that you have with a straight face because i think

17:49.440 --> 17:55.120
it's conservatory oh yes i think that would be the one that would be the toughest to say like oh this

17:56.240 --> 18:03.120
is the conservatory that or i think the ballroom the ballroom is tough the ballroom is tough if you

18:03.120 --> 18:09.680
say you have a conservatory though it's just to murder someone in hands down that's my main sort

18:09.680 --> 18:13.520
of familiarity with the room it's and which is weird because you're not conserving something

18:13.520 --> 18:20.000
you're snuffing it for it should be called a snuffatory probably sex dungeon yeah that's

18:20.000 --> 18:25.920
tough that's tough um you know they also call conservatory solariums that's even worse i think

18:25.920 --> 18:31.120
i think you could get away with solarium only because people would like if you walked into

18:31.120 --> 18:34.640
you know sometimes people like screen in their back porch or they like you know have windows

18:34.640 --> 18:39.440
in the back porch or whatever if you walked in and said this is my solarium i wouldn't know that

18:39.440 --> 18:44.400
you're right but i also wouldn't know that you're wrong and i wouldn't say anything you could get

18:44.400 --> 18:49.360
away with that but if you walked me back there and you said this is my conservatory i would say

18:49.360 --> 18:54.720
no it is not the solarium is a room where you watch the george clinty vehicle solaris yes that

18:54.720 --> 19:00.640
is the main purpose of that but don't use your desk looping don't even fucking think about eating

19:00.640 --> 19:05.920
popcorn while you enjoyed the movie there is a separate room for that you should know better

19:05.920 --> 19:10.400
you have to go into the other room if you want a salty snack my favorite is like how it differs by

19:10.400 --> 19:14.320
country like if you're in london and you say where's the water closet they'll be like oh

19:14.320 --> 19:20.160
it's right over there but if i said that shit here i'm getting booed out of town and people

19:20.160 --> 19:25.440
are just gonna make fun of me till i cry water down my face i didn't know this when i first the

19:25.440 --> 19:29.760
first time i traveled internationally i went to cologne germany for a games conference and i

19:29.760 --> 19:34.480
didn't know i didn't even know what water closet was so when i saw the you know restroom sign with

19:34.480 --> 19:42.560
wc on it i thought like this is where wc fields goes to shit and i think they are dead um and then

19:42.560 --> 19:47.600
i remember asking somebody like where the where the toilet was and when they corrected me i felt

19:47.600 --> 19:52.880
like such a boob because it's that must be like somebody over here was like where's where do you

19:52.880 --> 19:59.440
keep your shitter and pisser at where i can make where i can make my dirty trash in a hole because

19:59.440 --> 20:05.600
i didn't say the good way to say it i guess wc must stand for worst conservatory this is the

20:05.600 --> 20:10.640
worst conservatory i've ever seen in my life if i ever end up selling my house i'm gonna walk

20:10.640 --> 20:15.440
people through it saying and this is the bed conservatory and this is the bath conservatory

20:15.440 --> 20:22.160
and this is kind of the living conservatory uh and this is the scullery i work in the office

20:22.160 --> 20:30.320
at a factory and we have random spirits days with themes i rarely participate yeah that sucks but i

20:30.320 --> 20:37.280
woke up this morning and put on a floral tank top hawaiian shirt shorts and hula girl dress socks

20:37.280 --> 20:42.880
for vacation clothes day hold on a second the name of that is fucking chilling and i have to

20:42.880 --> 20:53.280
put my head between my legs that's grueling can you even imagine what it would be like if you

20:53.280 --> 20:57.840
had imagine you got to wear these for their intended purpose now you will wear them as a

20:57.840 --> 21:03.440
cruel joke i have made a mockery of your vacation clothes couldn't couldn't we just call it vacation

21:03.440 --> 21:09.120
day no because then they might not show up no no no we have vacation days but they're pretty much

21:09.120 --> 21:13.840
just for going to your nana's funeral they're not for actually like fucking relaxing because you get

21:13.840 --> 21:21.920
four of them vacation clothes day as i pulled into the parking lot i had the sudden realization

21:21.920 --> 21:27.040
that i only glanced at the theme schedule once jotted it down on my calendar and heard no word

21:27.040 --> 21:32.320
of it since i'm now second guessing myself what if today isn't a spirit day should i call in from

21:32.320 --> 21:39.600
the parking lot and go home and that's from floral in fort wayne this took a this took a chronological

21:39.600 --> 21:46.480
turn that i wasn't quite expecting like it was it was not a a perspective shift as much as it was

21:46.480 --> 21:53.120
like a time a time shift i think this question asker is a time shifter i like questions where

21:53.120 --> 21:59.520
people send them to us and they're the answer is only applicable for about a five minute window

21:59.520 --> 22:05.600
several weeks ago it gives you the sense of urgency but not you're right it's like some

22:05.600 --> 22:11.760
simultaneous urgency and the complete lack thereof i think it is completely legitimate

22:12.400 --> 22:20.480
for you to put on vacation clothes and then drive to your workplace and then look in there and look

22:20.480 --> 22:26.160
at what you're wearing and think this is so fucking grim i'm gonna actually just do the

22:26.160 --> 22:30.480
vaca i'm already dressed for it this is what this person is debating right right should i

22:30.480 --> 22:36.480
just take a vacation day like yeah probably yeah yeah you're already dressed for it just fucking

22:36.480 --> 22:41.360
piss off this all day this is the start of at least two different movies that i can think of

22:41.360 --> 22:45.840
joe versus the volcano in office space look at this moment of like you know what i'm just gonna

22:45.840 --> 22:53.120
wear my whole lion shirt to work oh also i fucking hate this place this place sucks also you know it

22:53.120 --> 22:56.880
all comes out in the wash sometimes you'll be out on spring break and you'll wake up and you'll put

22:56.880 --> 23:01.920
on some khakis and you'll put on a nice oxford and you'll be like oh i guess my body wants work

23:02.480 --> 23:06.720
and then you'll go to work because it's what your body craves at that moment you gotta go

23:07.280 --> 23:13.040
or the clothes make the person is what i say it makes them go to the places that they need to go

23:13.040 --> 23:20.400
that day the traveling pants the ice cream suit all of those things ice cream suit you know what

23:20.400 --> 23:24.960
you're doing that day you know you're going down to cold stone and you know that you're robbing it

23:27.920 --> 23:33.440
oh no why did i put on this ice cream suit you put on the ice cream suit you pull the hood over

23:33.440 --> 23:40.000
your face you say i gotta have it i would say have no fear walk into work wearing it and if people

23:40.000 --> 23:45.040
are like why are you dressed like that just say it's a spirit day because here's the thing it's a

23:45.040 --> 23:51.120
completely arbitrary thing and if someone says no it isn't then you say well point me towards the

23:51.120 --> 24:00.240
spirit day authority and we'll find out that's good you could also look at the calendar and

24:00.240 --> 24:08.000
that and be more diligent about that is a one step you need it for today yeah i know i know i know um

24:09.200 --> 24:13.600
i'm just saying in the future it would be cool to do whatever tomorrow's spirit day is gonna be

24:13.600 --> 24:18.080
just to give people a sneak peek of what it's gonna what how big a jackass they're gonna look

24:18.080 --> 24:22.800
like for the next one hey guys why are you wearing pajamas i'm just saying next week this

24:22.800 --> 24:27.760
is what you're all gonna look like so really think about it it is it is interesting to think

24:27.760 --> 24:32.720
that it sounds like there's a really loose grasp on what day is what you could just wear whatever

24:32.720 --> 24:38.240
the fuck you want to work any day and if someone sees you be like why are you like oh i thought it

24:38.240 --> 24:45.040
was and it's like okay cool like just wear whatever you want this is it sounds like wild west

24:45.040 --> 24:50.800
you're you're speaking as someone who has worked out of their home for the past several years you

24:50.800 --> 24:58.800
you have lost perspective that is true i have worked many a job with many a dress code and man

24:58.800 --> 25:06.160
it's uh you started i hate khaki pants so much y'all i can't i've worked so many oh khaki pants

25:06.160 --> 25:13.040
can't get me in them these days i've turned mine into fun t-shirts i watched i watched a facebook

25:13.040 --> 25:17.760
video where you cut the uh crotch out of it and you can make them into cool t-shirts you just put

25:17.760 --> 25:22.000
your head through the crotch hole and you wear the legs like sleeves now you're getting it

25:24.960 --> 25:30.960

glasses and we solve all your bookish problems every thursday on maximum fun uh hey can i tell

32:16.960 --> 32:22.320
okay uh yahoo time you want to yeah i love that all right this one's sent in by nick thanks nick

32:22.320 --> 32:28.080
it's anonymous yahoo answers user alissa who asks okay no joke i found a four-leaf clover

32:28.080 --> 32:36.880
clover in your opinion should i eat it to get the luck out of it would that let me absorb the luck

32:36.880 --> 32:40.160
in parentheses if you want to see the clover it's on my instagram and then they've provided

32:40.160 --> 32:47.280
their instagram handle here's the thing if you hold the clover you get a little bit of luck over

32:47.280 --> 32:53.440
time right spread out over time until it's all used up interesting eat the clover you do get

32:53.440 --> 33:01.600
a big burst of luck yeah right so one big good luck for eating the clover right so the question

33:01.600 --> 33:09.280
maybe the question is what do you have planned for the day if you're like i've got i've got the

33:09.280 --> 33:14.880
big game coming up yeah eat the clover eat it but if you're like i was just gonna sit around

33:15.760 --> 33:20.800
maybe hold the clover and you find like a dollar in the couch you know what i mean i'm saying

33:20.800 --> 33:26.880
uh griffin would you eat it well i'd if it's for the big game as you know when you eat it you get

33:26.880 --> 33:33.760
about four seconds of super good luck so i would need a whole big old ziploc bag full of these

33:34.320 --> 33:40.640
things which i probably have to crowdsource you could do like okay you got two strikes it's the

33:41.280 --> 33:48.800
bottom of the ninth you're down by two right you're you're at bat you got two players on

33:48.800 --> 33:55.120
base already you see the pitcher wind up real quick you pop it in your mouth chew it up and

33:55.120 --> 33:59.760
then you swing i mean a satellite a satellite falls from the skies and destroys the pitcher

33:59.760 --> 34:04.000
which of course counts as a home run for the batter which is a weird rule i don't know what

34:04.000 --> 34:09.200
they allow if the pitcher's destroyed mid-pitch it's called interference and his automatic home

34:09.200 --> 34:14.160
run here's what they don't tell you this is what leprechauns won't tell you i'm gonna pull the

34:14.160 --> 34:18.960
curtain back what leprechauns won't tell you is the good luck you get from four-leaf clover is

34:18.960 --> 34:23.120
because that four-leaf clover has siphoned luck away from someone else and given them bad luck

34:23.120 --> 34:27.520
so in that circumstance you're getting a burst of good luck and the pitcher is getting a pretty

34:27.520 --> 34:31.840
solid burst of bad luck right like what are the odds because if you're gonna have good luck

34:31.840 --> 34:37.520
someone else has to suffer just remember that recently looking at traf yeah i know listen i'm

34:37.520 --> 34:44.480
telling you what those leprechaun big wigs won't tell you i'm ready to give you all the secrets

34:44.480 --> 34:49.920
that the leprechauns don't want you to know buy my book for $29.99 buy my book

34:51.680 --> 34:52.560
you guys like the critic

34:55.280 --> 34:59.360
so like it's been our new segment you guys like the critic it's a pretty good segment

34:59.360 --> 35:06.960
it stinks justin it stinks oh i love that it stinks right if you're if it's in you

35:07.520 --> 35:11.520
you're still making content does it have to be physical contact for the luck to get on you or

35:11.520 --> 35:16.960
what's this what's the story uh yeah i mean you have to be in possession of it that's nine-tenths

35:16.960 --> 35:23.840
of the law read a book but the thing is is when you consume it your tummy acids start breaking

35:23.840 --> 35:30.240
down the luck molecules oh so that's where the energy is released right big burst but then

35:30.240 --> 35:36.640
they're gone how many three leaf clothes can my tummy tell if i've taken a three leaf clover and

35:36.640 --> 35:43.520
glued a fourth leaf onto it now if you have four three leaf clovers you do have three four leaf

35:43.520 --> 35:51.680
clovers so that that's another thing the leprechauns won't tell yeah your stomach is your stomach

35:51.680 --> 35:55.440
the people working in your tummy factor you're like oh shit we got a lot of four leaf clovers

35:55.440 --> 35:59.760
coming in whatever that's one two three twelve okay yeah whatever the fuck oh man i don't know

35:59.760 --> 36:05.520
this job's so hard oh corn corn corn alert corn we still haven't figured out what to do with this

36:05.520 --> 36:14.960
shit oh no i want a munch

36:14.960 --> 36:22.560
for some reason that one gave me the feeling of like a janitor rolling in in the middle of a

36:22.560 --> 36:27.280
meeting just like hey don't mind me just here to empty the cans i want a munch

36:27.280 --> 36:33.440
do

36:41.440 --> 36:49.200
that's my manhattan transfer version yeah it was really good good news for dirt bags

36:49.200 --> 36:59.200
okay kfc's cheetos sandwich is going national baby following the limited time launches of

37:00.240 --> 37:06.400
pickle fried chicken kentucky fried chicken and waffles and cinnabon dessert biscuits

37:06.400 --> 37:12.720
the kfc cheeto sandwich is another example of how kfc is continuing to take food innovation

37:12.720 --> 37:20.080
in to new heights after an overwhelmingly successful test earlier this year kentucky

37:20.080 --> 37:28.240
fried chicken and fan favorite cheetos are giving fans nation they just they should just say dirt

37:28.240 --> 37:35.280
bags but okay giving fans nationwide access to the sought after cheetos sandwich for just

37:35.280 --> 37:45.200
just four short weeks beginning july 1st this is a special twist on the kfc crispy colonel sandwich

37:45.920 --> 37:52.320
this and i think this is literal in this case dangerously cheesy combination

37:53.760 --> 38:00.720
is made by coding kfc's juicy hand breaded okay i'm not going to tell you guys we're

38:00.720 --> 38:06.480
much called quiz how do you think the kfc cheetos sandwich is constructed

38:07.360 --> 38:13.520
give me your recipe for if i come into the meeting and i'm like boys we gotta do it kfc

38:13.520 --> 38:20.080
g x cheetos make the sandwich what is it i'm going to say it's hand breaded including did

38:20.080 --> 38:27.920
you say ham breaded because that you're on the right track it's okay i think there's cheetos

38:27.920 --> 38:36.080
dust in it and then maybe some kind of like cheesy sauce cheetos has to be a part of every

38:36.080 --> 38:41.120
yeah whole ass cheetos right there on top i think whole ass cheetos are on there i think cheetos

38:41.840 --> 38:47.280
i think they will call it cheetos milk cheetos blood i think they'll just call it it's it's

38:47.280 --> 38:52.640
hand breaded and i love how they say it's hand breaded as if i care about the fucking like

38:52.640 --> 39:00.080
the tlc that went into this fucking yeah i think it's cheetos all the way down and and with each

39:00.080 --> 39:07.120
sandwich we put just a little bit of irony in every hand breaded fillet yeah eat ironically

39:07.120 --> 39:14.560
kfc the dangerously cheesy combination is made by coding kfc's juicy hand breaded extra crispy

39:14.560 --> 39:23.040
chicken fillet with special cheetos sauce that's what it says special cheetos sauce

39:24.240 --> 39:29.600
get that regular cheetos sauce the fuck out of here this is for jeremy he deserves the best

39:30.800 --> 39:37.760
this and placing it on a toasted bun with a this is a quote that i fucking cannot parse

39:37.760 --> 39:43.520
with a quote pinch of the thumb index and middle fingers layer of crunchy cheetos huh

39:43.520 --> 39:50.000
huh i don't know what that means but that's what it said i i guess it's like how many you can get

39:50.000 --> 39:55.360
with three fingers if you imagine that grabbing motion like that amount of cheetos out is like

39:55.360 --> 40:02.800
on there and then it says with the colonel's mayo and i don't know if we can hold that

40:02.800 --> 40:09.520
but i would like to not include the colonel's mayo just waiting for an expose doesn't it

40:09.520 --> 40:14.560
yeah what did you think the colonel's mayo was this is why they keep going through the actors

40:14.560 --> 40:18.720
so fast it's because reba steps in she's like gosh i'm excited to be the colonel and they're

40:18.720 --> 40:23.760
like okay so we do have to tell you the company secret they open up the briefcase and she looks

40:23.760 --> 40:29.680
at it and says no i'm done y'all let's find another one at the end you are processed and

40:29.680 --> 40:35.520
turned into the colonel's i haven't seen reba in a while where's reba reba's gone i love the new

40:35.520 --> 40:45.200
barbecue flavor of the colonel's mayo chaos colonel's mayo is reba to celebrate the nationwide

40:45.200 --> 40:51.520
launch of the sandwich chester cheetah will be murdered summarily no he doesn't say that

40:52.160 --> 40:57.920
chester cheetah will be taking over manhattan's 14th street kfc restaurant can't the police do

40:57.920 --> 41:04.400
something what does that mean he's gonna be taking i'm gonna tell you i'm gonna tell you

41:04.400 --> 41:12.160
travis i'm excited uh yeah well it's gonna be an exclusive all orange everything pop-up event

41:12.160 --> 41:15.440
where customers can try the sandwich for the first time in advance of the restaurant in

41:15.440 --> 41:21.600
restaurant availability on july 1st why does that stuff always happen in new york

41:21.600 --> 41:29.200
it just doesn't seem fair i'm not there um both cans kfc and cheetos have dedicated and passionate

41:29.200 --> 41:34.640
fan bases which if you have to say it in a press release is probably a lie so it only made sense

41:34.640 --> 41:41.200
to merge these two iconic brands together did it to provide an irresistible and flavorful sandwich

41:41.200 --> 41:49.840
that offers the best of both worlds oh my god planet planet cheese and kfc help best of both

41:49.840 --> 41:58.560
worlds fought um it's uh they're creating delicious menu items that flan fans flock toward which is

41:58.560 --> 42:04.240
accurate because they are sheep i am looking at a picture of this sandwich and what i want to discuss

42:04.240 --> 42:10.640
now is the textural difficulties that this thing's gonna provide first of all it's bigger than any

42:10.640 --> 42:16.240
human mouth like you're gonna have to attack this thing from the side good good news the people

42:16.240 --> 42:21.280
eating this can only loosely be described as humans okay so that's fine let's just go through it

42:21.280 --> 42:26.320
bottom to top and talk about the textural experience bottom bun that's soggy as fuck

42:26.320 --> 42:30.720
at this point there's no way that bun's getting to you with any amount of crisp toastiness left

42:30.720 --> 42:35.440
then you just have wet that's the colonel's mayo and you know how i feel about that then you have

42:35.440 --> 42:40.800
whole ass fucking cheetos that's gonna be you know they're toothsome they're a toothsome bite

42:40.800 --> 42:44.320
and there are they're gonna flop all around they're gonna be loose that's a challenge and

42:44.320 --> 42:49.840
then you have very very heavily crusted fried chicken you get the more crunch meat crunch on

42:49.840 --> 42:55.920
top of that and then another wet bread there's like that's so that is gonna suck there is no

42:55.920 --> 43:01.840
way that you pull your mouth away from that thing with what you would call a good bite of it a good

43:01.840 --> 43:08.240
cross-section good representative bite of this fucking thing this looks like a real agro crag

43:08.960 --> 43:16.240
i would eat the hell out of this oh my god travis listen i wouldn't be proud of it but i'm saying

43:16.240 --> 43:21.360
that given the opportunity to try it i wouldn't i don't think i'd come away well i don't think i'd

43:21.360 --> 43:25.520
walk away from the experience at all but i don't think i'd walk away from the experience saying

43:25.520 --> 43:31.360
like this is it this is the new chase sensation but if you gave me the opportunity to eat a cheetos

43:32.080 --> 43:37.360
you know chicken sandwich or whatever i'd probably do it i like cheetos i like fried

43:37.360 --> 43:43.840
chicken if we can hold you know the colonel's mess then i would totally check it out the colonel's

43:43.840 --> 43:51.040
made such the colonel ancestors made such a big mess they're selling such a big big mess

43:51.040 --> 43:57.120
um and also quick munch quad jr just so people don't send it to me arby's made a carrot out of

43:57.120 --> 44:02.960
meat yeah it's just a fucking they're not gonna sell it i'm only interested in things that they

44:02.960 --> 44:09.280
think that you a human would consume with your but want to consume with your body um so yes that

44:09.280 --> 44:14.560
also happened it's called the merit because it's made of meat that man they sure do like meat there

44:14.560 --> 44:21.360
huh i've noticed i've noticed a thread a sort of common thread with all of their sort of messaging

44:21.360 --> 44:25.600
they sure do like meat and you know what they hate fucking vegetables yeah they don't like

44:25.600 --> 44:31.040
vegetables they do love meat this next question that we got we don't normally do these like help

44:31.040 --> 44:38.080
me like make a judgment call here but this one just baked my noodle so hard i had to include it

44:38.080 --> 44:42.960
because i want to know what you guys think oh yeah this is this is an important subject uh

44:42.960 --> 44:47.120
justin would you please read the question i would read it but i think that would weird people out

44:47.120 --> 44:54.080
because it's just not what we do at a gaming convention last summer what i needed a gaming

44:54.080 --> 45:00.960
convention uh last summer i needed to quickly grab lunch between panels i was muttering the line at

45:00.960 --> 45:05.280
the food truck was huge so i walked to the person who was first in line and offered to pay them for

45:05.280 --> 45:11.680
their meal if they ordered for me too oh my friend says this is the same as cutting in line and was

45:11.680 --> 45:16.800
bad i think it's more like postmates where i paid someone to get lunch for me but on the other hand

45:16.800 --> 45:21.760
i recognize that this increased the wait in line for the time it would take to cook my order i'm

45:21.760 --> 45:26.800
worried my friend might be right they are so i haven't done this since then brothers was i cutting

45:26.800 --> 45:35.360
in line or no and that's from genuinely concerned at gen con let's yes this was bad can we obviously

45:35.360 --> 45:39.840
back can you've run the numbers already you know it was bad you've run the numbers can we can we

45:39.840 --> 45:45.680
tweak it can we tweak reality just a little bit i got this i got one of thanos's cool stones and

45:45.680 --> 45:49.920
i snapped my fingers and the thing changes okay what if instead of going to the person in the

45:49.920 --> 45:55.200
front of the line and saying like hey it's like postmates you work for hey look you work for me

45:55.200 --> 46:00.080
now instead of that what if your buddy is like like in the middle of the line or close to the

46:00.080 --> 46:05.440
front of the line you're like oh shit hey can you go ahead and get me a burrito too is that bad no

46:05.440 --> 46:11.520
this is what i'm saying i don't think this is bad i think what it is is it's revolutionary and

46:11.520 --> 46:17.040
sometimes when something is revolutionary it can seem bad it can seem scary at the time but then

46:17.040 --> 46:22.400
we look back on it in the future and it's like wow on that day they changed the game of ordering

46:22.400 --> 46:26.720
at food trucks now here's the problem if everyone starts to do this there's going to be one person

46:26.720 --> 46:34.720
in line who's ordering 500 meals yeah yeah and the 500 the 500th person is going to have to

46:34.720 --> 46:41.120
get stuck with the bill which is too bad have have you guys noticed that i i my hat does do

46:41.120 --> 46:47.920
go off to this person in one regard that i have found with food trucks that you are either ordering

46:47.920 --> 46:56.560
um and getting your food in like a few minutes or spending a good amount of your life and missing

46:56.560 --> 47:01.680
your daughter's high school graduation as you wait for a slimy taco have you noticed this

47:01.680 --> 47:06.080
like there's an immense amount of variability in food truck speed that we've all just decided to

47:06.080 --> 47:11.920
accept yeah yeah what's what's the deal can you say it like that can you do it again justin but

47:11.920 --> 47:16.960
do it like what's the what is the deal with food what is the deal with food truck jerry never got

47:16.960 --> 47:21.280
to do that do you ever think about the the jokes that seinfeld didn't get to do i bet he'd have

47:21.280 --> 47:28.880
some stuff to say i bet he'd have some fun with that what no but can i just say but for real guys

47:28.880 --> 47:36.800
what is the deal with food trucks is it a car this sucks uh it's it's obviously cutscenes if

47:36.800 --> 47:45.040
you put your body in the line yes but it's like psychic cutscenes if you just put your desires

47:45.040 --> 47:54.240
in the line i would argue that it's only cutscenes if you are adding one more sale between like if

47:54.240 --> 47:58.320
if i if someone said like if someone said i'm gonna get a burrito right and someone walked up

47:58.320 --> 48:03.760
and said make it two burritos the order time is the same now someone said i'm gonna get a burrito

48:03.760 --> 48:12.640
and they say cool let me step in behind you and i too obviously obviously we're talking about the

48:12.640 --> 48:19.840
other thing i have i have a new i have a new plan stand at the front of the line with a stack of 20

48:19.840 --> 48:28.480
us dollar bills as people have um received their order in the moment in the flush of victory upon

48:28.480 --> 48:35.600
receiving their order you offer to buy hey can i have three chips oh can i just have three chips

48:36.160 --> 48:40.640
for this one dollar bill you won't want those three chips by the time you're done consuming

48:40.640 --> 48:47.840
your dish just give me three chips and then i think you can just sort of give me one of your

48:47.840 --> 48:53.600
burrito it's like food antiquing you know you're just you're just getting a little bit off the top

48:53.600 --> 49:00.320
you're at the sampler table you're getting your points on the back end exactly exactly hey here's

49:00.320 --> 49:06.960
here's the deal i'll stand in line with you massage your back i'm just gonna need 10 points

49:06.960 --> 49:13.600
on that burrito and merch rights merch rights to that burrito did i say merch i meant munch rights

49:13.600 --> 49:19.760
on your burrito uh just three chips you can have the first bite because i know how that i wouldn't

49:19.760 --> 49:26.800
like it but i get the second slice me off one fifth of that kit kat bar and i bring me off a

49:26.800 --> 49:31.760
well-measured piece of that kit kat bar now i'm off to dessert now you don't want my mouth on your

49:31.760 --> 49:36.000
food that's fine i got two buckets here one's full of quarters one's about to be full of little

49:36.000 --> 49:40.880
slices of food that my friend my new friends whittle off into it and then there's a third

49:40.880 --> 49:47.520
bucket that's for cleaning the other two buckets don't look at that bucket it gets so fucking nasty

49:48.480 --> 49:53.360
and don't put the food in the quarters one i don't want that metal stink all over my falafel

49:55.600 --> 50:01.520
this is time theft don't fucking do it i think it's fine do it your friend was right don't do

50:01.520 --> 50:06.000
it i think your friend is just afraid of the change you've made in the world the ripple that

50:06.000 --> 50:12.640
you've begun the bad ripple the ripple of painting there maybe you're a doofus maybe maybe it's bad

50:12.640 --> 50:22.480
maybe it's not sometimes change is scary we are fucking hanging on by a thread we are hanging on

50:22.480 --> 50:32.240
by a thread and waiting in line for food is like ground level society do not start dismantling what

50:32.240 --> 50:39.360
little fabric we have left as a people wait in line for your fucking churro and then get it like

50:39.360 --> 50:44.400
everybody else okay we're hanging on by a fucking thread and we're all just going to wait in line

50:44.400 --> 50:49.760
and enjoy our burritos all right all right you know what you've convinced me justin what if

50:49.760 --> 50:57.440
there was 60 windows on this what is now becoming a sort of food train and you have to catch up with

50:57.440 --> 51:02.320
the food train food train is better because that's the problem is there's just the one window

51:02.320 --> 51:09.600
and no one's talking about that no one's talking about food train no one's talking about how if

51:09.600 --> 51:16.000
you had 60 windows we could all just get our food the moment we want it you know what's it thank you

51:16.000 --> 51:22.320
you know it's a kick-ass spot that millennials love to go and nosh down at is amtrak stations

51:22.320 --> 51:28.480
amtrak stations get there after the big game head over there after church get to the amtrak station

51:28.480 --> 51:35.840
hit up the food train okay listen can i hit you guys stop the podcast and let's talk about food

51:35.840 --> 51:41.200
train for a second right what if there was a single train track that wound its way through

51:41.200 --> 51:50.080
this great land we called america and there are food train stops wherever like all throughout the

51:50.080 --> 51:57.200
country right but it's just the one train and the one train track and then when you started to get

51:57.200 --> 52:03.360
a line you have like a single car right and people are lining up there at the carnival because it's

52:03.360 --> 52:08.480
in town for the carnival that you're having all events will take place on the food train track

52:08.480 --> 52:16.880
okay so you if the line gets to be more than two people in line another car on the food train

52:16.880 --> 52:23.360
comes and joins that one and all of a sudden you got twice as many windows no one is waiting if

52:23.360 --> 52:29.280
those people dissipate the food train goes to the next station where it is needed do you understand

52:29.280 --> 52:36.880
it's infinite capacity and it only does hamburgers you can't special order it yes there's just the

52:36.880 --> 52:43.440
hamburgers on your fault is it they are good hamburgers not the best hamburgers it's not

52:43.440 --> 52:47.920
it's not burger king you can't have it your way you have it train way that's it that's the only

52:47.920 --> 52:53.120
way available this train this idea beats so much ass that it's going to become the only legal way

52:53.120 --> 52:59.600
to obtain food now we've entered into a program that i would like to call snack piercer and in

52:59.600 --> 53:05.760
this one we have to we you have to live on burger train you know you never hear about how these

53:05.760 --> 53:11.760
dystopian societies start with a kick-ass idea like food train they all like maybe it was supposed

53:11.760 --> 53:17.680
to be like dope like wouldn't it be cool if we could just watch everybody big brother happens

53:17.680 --> 53:21.760
you know what i mean but at the beginning it was like that would be cool like we could watch

53:21.760 --> 53:26.400
everybody and just make sure they don't get into trouble it would be so sick if some of us started

53:26.400 --> 53:30.640
eating the other ones of us and then it's like walking dead it's like oops you took it i didn't

53:30.640 --> 53:38.320
mean i didn't mean all of us ah shoot dang it i stand by food train though i feel pretty good

53:38.320 --> 53:43.840
just need some investors the oils they have hot oils inside and when it takes a turn

53:48.240 --> 53:54.560
that's why only automatons can work on food train that thing's giving away american jobs justin

53:55.840 --> 54:00.640
they're i'm create it's a zero-sum game travis i'm not taking away any jobs there isn't a food

54:00.640 --> 54:08.640
train right now it's a zero-sum game you are taking away hypothetical jobs dystopian jobs

54:08.640 --> 54:14.560
yes now what i do like is you're also creating american jobs because someone would need to build

54:14.560 --> 54:20.960
both the train and the automatons i like that part and destroy so many buildings to make way

54:20.960 --> 54:26.640
for the food train tracks it i i estimate to have a train track that it weaves its way through our

54:26.640 --> 54:34.880
entire country will take let me just check my mouth here 783 years so there is that especially

54:34.880 --> 54:39.360
just put it where there are especially because it's going to purposefully weave directly through

54:39.360 --> 54:46.000
