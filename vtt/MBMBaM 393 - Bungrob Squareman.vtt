00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:46.480
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother, my brother and me,

00:46.480 --> 00:49.840
an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

00:49.840 --> 00:51.920
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

00:51.920 --> 01:01.040
I'm that sweet baby brother in 30 Under 30 Media, Luminary Griffin McElroy.

01:01.040 --> 01:02.400
Just sounds like you're scatting.

01:02.400 --> 01:03.600
Do you know who did that?

01:03.600 --> 01:04.000
Scatman.

01:05.040 --> 01:06.000
John Williams, that's right.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.760
John the Scatman Williams.

01:07.760 --> 01:10.080
John Williams, feet the Scatman.

01:10.720 --> 01:15.360
Happy birthday, John Williams, turned 86, still cranking out the hit.

01:15.360 --> 01:16.800
What is this intro?

01:16.800 --> 01:24.480
Wow, it is an intro about the Olympics. Folks, the time to sign up for the Olympics

01:24.480 --> 01:29.920
is drawing close. You don't have much time left if you want to sign up to do an event.

01:31.280 --> 01:34.880
Some of the events are already ended, so those would be a little tougher to get into.

01:34.880 --> 01:41.040
Yeah, they can retroactively get you in. Talk to Troy.

01:41.680 --> 01:44.000
Yeah, talk to Troy at the gate.

01:44.000 --> 01:47.760
He's got the red backpack and talk to him and say,

01:47.760 --> 01:49.440
I want to do the big jump.

01:49.440 --> 01:51.920
And Troy will say, well, they already did the big jump.

01:51.920 --> 01:53.760
And then you say, please.

01:53.760 --> 01:55.360
And he says, all right, get up there.

01:55.360 --> 01:57.440
Then you do it the best anyone's ever done it.

01:57.440 --> 02:00.480
They go and they take the gold medal away from Germany.

02:00.480 --> 02:04.080
And they're like, sorry, Griffin did better at the big jump.

02:04.080 --> 02:05.120
He was a walk up.

02:05.760 --> 02:08.880
And then you tell everybody the story about Troy and Troy is fired.

02:09.440 --> 02:11.760
Because rules are rules, Troy.

02:11.760 --> 02:14.160
But they can't take your gold away from you.

02:14.160 --> 02:14.960
They cannot take it.

02:14.960 --> 02:19.360
Well, they can take it away from whoever did legally win it and give it to the walk up.

02:19.360 --> 02:21.280
And there's really no time limit.

02:21.280 --> 02:28.800
I actually got Kristy Yamaguchi's gold medal from, what was that?

02:28.800 --> 02:30.160
Nagano, I think.

02:30.160 --> 02:31.680
And this was like three weeks ago.

02:32.400 --> 02:37.520
It's amazing how few people take advantage of all the rules loopholes in the Olympics.

02:37.520 --> 02:37.920
There's a lot.

02:37.920 --> 02:42.880
I was reading a book by Matthew Lesko about all the rules that are just left on the table

02:42.880 --> 02:44.080
that nobody claims.

02:45.440 --> 02:51.360
If you hold an event in your backyard and call it the Olympics and you win one of the events,

02:51.360 --> 02:54.640
they have to give you a gold medal, like an official one.

02:54.640 --> 02:55.680
Did you know that?

02:55.680 --> 03:00.080
And then you can just turn around and you shouldn't because it's a nation's pride.

03:00.080 --> 03:03.440
But you can just go sell that dang thing for probably like 200 bucks.

03:03.440 --> 03:04.480
No problem.

03:04.480 --> 03:09.040
Did you know that you can go and compete in the Olympics as your own sovereign nation?

03:09.040 --> 03:10.000
Now, here's the thing.

03:10.000 --> 03:10.720
Let me be clear.

03:11.280 --> 03:15.040
It's not as easy as it sounds because you do have to establish your own government

03:15.040 --> 03:19.600
and your own Magna Carta or declaration or what have you.

03:20.320 --> 03:22.720
It does have to be recognized by the UN.

03:23.840 --> 03:29.840
But you can just go and be like the nation state of Griffin and just compete as Griffin.

03:29.840 --> 03:34.400
I've been thinking a lot about what event I want to do this year

03:34.400 --> 03:37.200
because I did miss the big jump and it's such a hassle finding Troy

03:37.200 --> 03:39.680
because sometimes he doesn't have the fucking backpack on.

03:40.400 --> 03:43.920
And I think I might do Tony Hawk's downhill jam.

03:46.080 --> 03:53.440
And this is his new event that he has going on based on the very good 2006 video game.

03:53.440 --> 03:59.920
And it's sort of a mix of jump, ski, slalom, stunt.

04:00.720 --> 04:02.560
And then halfway down, there's a half pipe.

04:03.120 --> 04:07.200
And then at the end, you withdraw the rifle you've had on your back the whole time

04:07.200 --> 04:12.320
and you shoot some cans out of the air that Tony Hawk throws up there for you.

04:12.320 --> 04:12.960
I love it.

04:15.600 --> 04:16.480
That's interesting.

04:16.480 --> 04:17.040
I'm going to be-

04:17.040 --> 04:19.600
Oh, also you have to cross country ski to the top of the hill,

04:19.600 --> 04:21.360
but that's not really part of the race.

04:21.360 --> 04:22.640
That's just to get there.

04:22.640 --> 04:22.880
Right.

04:22.880 --> 04:27.200
I'm actually going to be speed running Taboo the sixth sense for the NES.

04:27.200 --> 04:27.680
Interesting.

04:28.800 --> 04:29.120
Yeah.

04:29.120 --> 04:36.560
And that's a tarot card simulator, so it's not necessarily going to be competitive.

04:36.560 --> 04:40.640
I guess you have to wait for the medals to be distributed in the coming years

04:40.640 --> 04:44.720
as you see who's reading of the cards was the most accurate.

04:44.720 --> 04:45.440
Right.

04:45.440 --> 04:48.560
So it takes a while to get it, but it's an investment.

04:48.560 --> 04:51.280
And it's so subjective, the scoring on that one.

04:51.280 --> 04:54.160
I feel like I'm always getting boned.

04:54.160 --> 04:55.680
That's why I like the downhill jam.

04:55.680 --> 05:01.120
It's just me, my board, my cross country skis, my guns, and Tony's cans.

05:01.920 --> 05:05.200
I think this time, my wife and I have been training,

05:05.200 --> 05:11.040
Teresa and I have been training really hard in the competitive couples asynchronous napping.

05:11.040 --> 05:11.360
Yeah.

05:11.920 --> 05:15.440
Where it's like, I'm going to nap now and then I'll get up

05:15.440 --> 05:18.080
and I'll take care of the baby and then you can nap.

05:18.080 --> 05:23.040
Yeah, and the longer you can spread that out, the better that is for you.

05:23.040 --> 05:25.040
I thought I was going to end up on the podium

05:25.040 --> 05:28.240
because I went down at like 9am one day, early nap.

05:28.240 --> 05:30.880
And Rachel didn't nap until 11pm.

05:30.880 --> 05:31.600
And what happened?

05:32.240 --> 05:33.360
I didn't win anything.

05:33.360 --> 05:35.520
Travis, thanks for fucking rubbing it in.

05:35.520 --> 05:37.360
Well, you started the story.

05:37.360 --> 05:38.560
Yeah, I know.

05:38.560 --> 05:40.240
And then I didn't have an ending for it.

05:40.240 --> 05:43.760
And I didn't think anybody was going to call me on my bullshit, but here we are.

05:43.760 --> 05:45.440
I might also do curling.

05:45.440 --> 05:45.680
Yeah.

05:45.680 --> 05:50.160
Yeah, I forgot that this occurred until this is kind of a persistent delight

05:50.160 --> 05:52.720
that pops up every time the Olympics comes around,

05:53.840 --> 05:57.520
is that there's one called Skeleton, which is fun.

05:57.520 --> 06:03.040
There's like bobsled and downhill alpine and skeleton.

06:03.920 --> 06:07.120
That's just like xylophone playing, but it's your own ribs.

06:07.120 --> 06:07.680
Yeah, right.

06:07.680 --> 06:08.640
You got to play your own ribs.

06:08.640 --> 06:12.880
No, what's great about it is it's basically like bobsledding,

06:12.880 --> 06:14.960
but it's the tiniest possible sled.

06:14.960 --> 06:15.200
Yeah.

06:15.200 --> 06:16.880
So it's like this heightened awareness of like,

06:17.680 --> 06:23.040
yeah, I will just name it after the thing that I'm going to destroy as I'm going down.

06:24.400 --> 06:27.760
Somebody looked at bobsled and said, not dangerous enough.

06:27.760 --> 06:29.200
Well, I have this luge.

06:29.200 --> 06:29.840
No, no, no.

06:30.560 --> 06:34.000
I want to be a centimeter off the ice with nothing around me.

06:35.200 --> 06:38.560
I wanted a sport where if I sneeze while I'm doing it, I will perish.

06:38.560 --> 06:41.120
That sounds very, very fun to me.

06:41.120 --> 06:46.720
Hey, I thought of a really fucking good parody song this morning

06:46.720 --> 06:48.160
while we were watching the Olympics.

06:48.160 --> 06:49.440
Can I tell you it?

06:49.440 --> 06:50.400
Yeah, please.

06:50.400 --> 06:54.880
It goes like, so I'm a parody-dor.

06:54.880 --> 06:56.720
I'm a lusher, baby.

06:58.400 --> 06:59.520
I'm a lusher.

06:59.520 --> 07:00.480
I'm a lusher.

07:00.480 --> 07:04.880
Sorry, the microphone I have sometimes has trouble with the quality and fidelity.

07:04.880 --> 07:09.600
So I'm worried that you're hearing it and you actually think I'm doing a Pitch Perfect version

07:09.600 --> 07:12.960
of Beck's loser.

07:12.960 --> 07:17.520
But instead of saying loser, it's lusher.

07:17.520 --> 07:18.560
And then what's the next line?

07:19.680 --> 07:21.440
So why don't you thrill me?

07:21.440 --> 07:26.000
Because you're so excited to be out there.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.200
So Al, get at me.

07:34.240 --> 07:36.080
Al takes our calls.

07:36.080 --> 07:37.280
He was in our TV show.

07:37.280 --> 07:39.760
I'm assuming he would take our call, right?

07:39.760 --> 07:41.200
I have to imagine.

07:41.200 --> 07:42.400
Hey, brothers, I have a moral dilemma.

07:42.400 --> 07:44.080
I was talking to Al Jarreau, actually.

07:44.080 --> 07:45.200
He's getting into the game.

07:46.720 --> 07:47.840
I think he passed away.

07:47.840 --> 07:49.360
Let your losing down.

07:49.360 --> 07:52.000
Let your losing here to stay.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.400
Make it easy, easy.

07:54.400 --> 07:55.680
Let your losing down.

07:56.400 --> 07:57.840
Hey, brothers, I have a moral dilemma.

07:58.640 --> 08:00.400
You don't get to do your Al Jarreau enough.

08:00.400 --> 08:02.640
My fucking dope ass Al Jarreau.

08:03.600 --> 08:04.960
I'm so glad.

08:04.960 --> 08:07.280
I need 393 episodes.

08:07.280 --> 08:09.120
You can hide your light under a bushel.

08:09.120 --> 08:12.480
To finally get to do my fucking great Al Jarreau.

08:12.480 --> 08:13.920
I'm just so glad.

08:14.560 --> 08:16.800
It has brought such a tickle to my heart

08:16.800 --> 08:19.520
that you were able to do your Al Jarreau finally.

08:19.520 --> 08:19.920
Yeah.

08:19.920 --> 08:23.200
We lost Al Jarreau, oh my god,

08:23.200 --> 08:26.320
exactly one year upon you hearing this.

08:26.320 --> 08:27.520
Holy shit.

08:27.520 --> 08:28.640
It's exactly one year ago.

08:28.640 --> 08:31.840
What a touching tribute we've been able to have.

08:31.840 --> 08:34.880
This is our touching accidental tribute to Al Jarreau

08:34.880 --> 08:36.480
who is very good at singing.

08:36.480 --> 08:38.160
Hey, brothers, I have a moral dilemma.

08:38.880 --> 08:40.480
I have been debating whether or not

08:40.480 --> 08:43.040
to put a Nintendo Switch on my wedding registry.

08:43.600 --> 08:46.240
My fiance is on board as she is the one who suggested it.

08:46.240 --> 08:47.280
So nobody's there.

08:48.000 --> 08:51.520
My problem is that I feel if people see an expensive toy

08:51.520 --> 08:53.040
on there like the Switch,

08:53.040 --> 08:55.040
they'll feel we really don't need anything

08:55.040 --> 08:57.040
and not give us as much presents.

08:57.040 --> 09:00.240
I'm sadly against putting one on for this reason.

09:00.240 --> 09:02.240
Am I making too big of a deal out of it?

09:02.240 --> 09:04.080
That's from fiscal fiance.

09:04.960 --> 09:06.720
You can work around this just by asking

09:06.720 --> 09:11.360
for like a $250 GameStop gift card on your registry,

09:11.360 --> 09:14.240
although I don't think that necessarily skirts this dilemma.

09:15.680 --> 09:18.720
Could you ask for a gift card for an exact price of the Switch

09:18.720 --> 09:20.880
for like Target or Walmart or something?

09:20.880 --> 09:23.040
There's other places you can, yeah, for sure.

09:23.040 --> 09:24.880
I mean, you know me, I'm brand loyal.

09:24.880 --> 09:27.280
Once you're in the fuck, once that GameStop.

09:27.840 --> 09:28.880
Once you're in the fuck.

09:28.880 --> 09:30.480
Once you're in the what?

09:31.280 --> 09:34.720
You said once you're in the fuck and then you stopped.

09:34.720 --> 09:36.160
Once you're in the fuck of GameStop.

09:38.320 --> 09:39.840
I'm just saying once you're in the fuck,

09:39.840 --> 09:41.040
I can't really get out.

09:41.040 --> 09:42.400
Hey man, I'm at GameStop.

09:42.400 --> 09:43.200
Well, how's it going?

09:43.200 --> 09:44.400
I'm deep in the fuck.

09:44.400 --> 09:45.840
It's brutal over here, man.

09:46.560 --> 09:47.600
Way down deep.

09:47.600 --> 09:50.320
I'm just saying, you sling enough reservations,

09:50.320 --> 09:53.600
you sling enough Game Informer subscriptions,

09:53.600 --> 09:55.920
you can't just get that out of your blood, you know?

09:55.920 --> 09:58.480
I mean, I did legit last night have a dream

09:58.480 --> 09:59.840
where I worked at Best Buy again.

09:59.840 --> 10:01.600
I have that about once a week.

10:01.600 --> 10:02.400
Yeah.

10:02.400 --> 10:05.280
I haven't worked at Best Buy since 2008.

10:05.280 --> 10:07.360
It has been a solid decade.

10:07.360 --> 10:08.560
It's the lunar cycle, bruh.

10:08.560 --> 10:10.080
Those blue shirts coming.

10:10.080 --> 10:14.080
So you could say that your dream is to work at Best Buy again.

10:14.080 --> 10:14.880
Literally.

10:14.880 --> 10:17.520
No, it's often an anxiety dream.

10:18.240 --> 10:19.040
I got you.

10:19.040 --> 10:20.800
In which everything has gone wrong

10:20.800 --> 10:24.320
and I've had once again to turn to the big blue embrace.

10:24.320 --> 10:29.920
Yes, I think it's fine to do a cute one on your registry,

10:29.920 --> 10:31.360
wedding or baby or what have you,

10:31.360 --> 10:33.600
because a lot of times I look at somebody's registry

10:33.600 --> 10:37.360
and I think, God, I don't want to get them something so poor.

10:37.360 --> 10:39.440
Like this is all so poor.

10:39.440 --> 10:41.040
Even though I'm not getting it,

10:41.040 --> 10:44.080
it bores me to like look at the page and think about it

10:44.080 --> 10:47.680
and then click it like, oh yeah, you can steam all your shirts.

10:47.680 --> 10:50.080
Every time you steam a shirt, you could think of me.

10:50.080 --> 10:52.320
No, just like, but like switch and be like,

10:52.320 --> 10:55.840
hey, that's fun, thank you, looks like a fun gift, I'm excited.

10:55.840 --> 10:57.680
Most of it feels so perfunctory.

10:57.680 --> 11:01.280
Like you see like a thing for like, oh, we need nipples.

11:01.280 --> 11:03.280
And it's like, I can get you nipples.

11:03.280 --> 11:08.080
And that point is just like, yeah, I got you some rags.

11:08.080 --> 11:10.320
And I know you need, and that's not a joke,

11:10.320 --> 11:14.000
you need hundreds and hundreds of rags for a baby,

11:14.000 --> 11:14.960
not so much for a wedding.

11:14.960 --> 11:16.400
I forgot what the question was about.

11:16.400 --> 11:18.080
But if I see a switch on there,

11:18.080 --> 11:20.480
I know that if you were, that's the only thing on there

11:20.480 --> 11:22.560
that you really want to get.

11:22.560 --> 11:23.760
The other stuff you need to get.

11:23.760 --> 11:25.440
And I think I would be, I mean,

11:25.440 --> 11:27.360
I'd probably want to split it with some folks

11:27.360 --> 11:30.560
because it would probably be one of the more expensive items

11:30.560 --> 11:30.960
on the list.

11:30.960 --> 11:34.560
But like, I would know that I'm getting you something

11:34.560 --> 11:36.240
that you're going to be very excited about,

11:36.240 --> 11:38.320
which is like the point of gift giving.

11:38.320 --> 11:40.320
I do understand this question though,

11:40.320 --> 11:43.360
because like I have encountered this many times in my life

11:43.360 --> 11:45.120
where someone will say like, so what do you want?

11:45.120 --> 11:45.840
What can I get you?

11:45.840 --> 11:49.600
And you say something like, you know, pretty out there,

11:49.600 --> 11:50.880
pretty like, I'll tell you what I want.

11:51.520 --> 11:53.840
What I really, really want, a couple of chia pets.

11:53.840 --> 11:54.880
And they're like, no.

11:55.440 --> 11:57.200
And I'm like, oh, that was what I wanted.

11:57.200 --> 11:58.960
But I guess you know better.

11:59.760 --> 12:01.600
I think the switch is also helpful here

12:01.600 --> 12:05.840
because it is such a strong experience for two players.

12:05.840 --> 12:10.880
Anywhere that you and your new spouse are out and about,

12:10.880 --> 12:13.200
you can enjoy some Puyo Puyo Tetris

12:13.200 --> 12:14.800
or what have you, some Superclips.

12:14.800 --> 12:17.360
There's the Dr. Phil marriage counseling game.

12:18.160 --> 12:19.360
That one's really hot.

12:19.360 --> 12:19.760
It's rated M.

12:19.760 --> 12:20.880
Who will let go first?

12:21.600 --> 12:23.120
It's rated M for mature

12:23.120 --> 12:25.280
because of just all the cussing that Dr. Phil does.

12:26.080 --> 12:27.680
You gotta fucking love each other.

12:27.680 --> 12:29.680
I don't know what Dr. Phil sounds like.

12:29.680 --> 12:32.000
Oh man, I know it's gonna fix your marriage.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.440
I've got it all figured out.

12:34.720 --> 12:36.640
You gotta plug in the Yoshi amiibo.

12:37.440 --> 12:38.240
Mini games.

12:39.280 --> 12:41.280
Do you know on the back in the day

12:41.280 --> 12:43.600
when we were trying to get this show going,

12:43.600 --> 12:45.840
I made business cards for my brother,

12:45.840 --> 12:48.080
my brother and me that I left all over town.

12:48.080 --> 12:51.600
And it had a web address where you could listen to the show

12:51.600 --> 12:55.600
and it had a quote ascribed to Dr. Phil.

12:56.480 --> 12:57.520
And the quote was,

12:57.520 --> 13:00.960
it's like listening to three invisible Dr. Phils.

13:00.960 --> 13:03.200
That was my, I said, I did that.

13:03.200 --> 13:05.520
And I was like, good enough for a business card.

13:05.520 --> 13:07.440
Let's go ahead and get 500 of these

13:07.440 --> 13:09.040
and get the word out about this show.

13:09.040 --> 13:11.840
And I guess you look at us today and I guess it worked.

13:11.840 --> 13:15.440
So what I'm saying to you is do exactly that.

13:15.440 --> 13:17.120
I showed a friend that business card

13:17.120 --> 13:20.800
and they expressed concern that he might sue us

13:20.800 --> 13:23.280
for attributing a quote to him that he did not say.

13:23.280 --> 13:26.480
And my response was, can you think of the publicity?

13:26.480 --> 13:27.280
How amazing would that be?

13:27.280 --> 13:29.440
Yeah, the best possible thing.

13:29.440 --> 13:31.120
I didn't put this switch on your registry.

13:31.120 --> 13:31.760
I think it's fine.

13:31.760 --> 13:34.400
I don't think, and if anybody sees this and says,

13:34.400 --> 13:35.840
well, I'm not gonna get them a present,

13:35.840 --> 13:37.120
you uninvite them from the wedding

13:37.120 --> 13:38.320
because they sound like a real square

13:38.320 --> 13:41.040
and it sounds like they hate Mario and his brother Luigi

13:41.040 --> 13:42.240
and their best friend Yoshi.

13:43.440 --> 13:45.280
Do you think Yoshi is equal best friends

13:45.280 --> 13:46.640
with Mario and Luigi?

13:46.640 --> 13:47.520
Or do you think it's the kind of thing

13:47.520 --> 13:49.920
where like Mario is friends with Yoshi first

13:49.920 --> 13:51.600
and like, yeah, he gets along with Luigi,

13:51.600 --> 13:55.040
but if push came to shove, you know whose side he'd be on.

13:55.040 --> 13:58.240
Okay, who is Mario's better friend, Luigi or Yoshi?

13:58.240 --> 13:59.920
Let's take a moment and think about this.

13:59.920 --> 14:01.760
Oh shit, or Toad.

14:01.760 --> 14:02.880
Where does it fall, okay.

14:02.880 --> 14:05.520
Toad is not, Toad is nobody's friend.

14:05.520 --> 14:09.920
Toad is tolerated because they need him around harvest time

14:09.920 --> 14:11.600
to pull all the onions out fast.

14:11.600 --> 14:16.480
If Mario is the Vinny Chase of the Mario World entourage,

14:16.480 --> 14:17.920
yeah, absolutely, I'm not doing this with you.

14:17.920 --> 14:19.920
Then I think Luigi's drama, right?

14:19.920 --> 14:21.200
Cause they're brothers.

14:21.200 --> 14:22.720
You're saying Luigi's like the heat

14:22.720 --> 14:24.480
that everybody's all in demand for.

14:24.480 --> 14:27.520
That's Vinny, Vinny, Vinny, Mario's Vinny.

14:27.520 --> 14:30.320
Johnny Drama, his older half-brother

14:30.320 --> 14:33.440
who once had a TV show, but now is in demand.

14:33.440 --> 14:34.880
Oh, can Bowser be turtle?

14:36.000 --> 14:38.560
No, I think Bowser would probably be.

14:39.360 --> 14:41.360
He looks like a fucking turtle.

14:41.360 --> 14:42.640
Might be Paramy Jivins.

14:43.600 --> 14:46.160
Can we not have Paramy involved in this project?

14:46.160 --> 14:47.600
I don't think Paramy's in this project.

14:47.600 --> 14:48.880
No, Paramy's fine.

14:48.880 --> 14:53.360
He's in the Bizarro version of Jeremy Piven?

14:53.360 --> 14:54.080
Awesome, dude.

14:55.200 --> 15:00.400
And so then the question is, is Toad E or is Yoshi E?

15:00.400 --> 15:02.160
I think Yoshi would be E and Toad would probably be turtle.

15:02.160 --> 15:04.320
I'm just gonna start reading the next Yahoo.

15:04.320 --> 15:05.040
But don't you think-

15:05.040 --> 15:06.480
And Travis can continue going.

15:06.480 --> 15:08.400
And the cross talk will be unbearable.

15:09.440 --> 15:10.640
But here's one-

15:10.640 --> 15:11.840
But then who's the director guy?

15:11.840 --> 15:14.000
From Merritt Palmer.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.280
Thank you, Merritt Palmer.

15:15.280 --> 15:18.560
It's from Yahoo Answers User Collection who asks-

15:18.560 --> 15:20.000
Walsh might be Waluigi?

15:20.800 --> 15:23.600
How to get Pac-Man dots off monitor.

15:25.280 --> 15:27.440
These, and then a bunch of periods.

15:28.800 --> 15:29.840
I want to eat these.

15:31.040 --> 15:31.920
This is a great point,

15:31.920 --> 15:33.280
as long as we're gonna talk about video games

15:33.280 --> 15:34.240
a whole bunch this episode.

15:35.600 --> 15:42.240
I have a trouble playing Pac-Man's little quest

15:42.240 --> 15:44.400
that he goes on, and Ms. Pac-Man.

15:44.400 --> 15:47.120
Sometimes, Griffin, I can't tell if you're still reading the Yahoo

15:47.120 --> 15:49.680
or if we've spiraled into Griffin's brain now.

15:49.680 --> 15:51.760
No, we're in here, in here in my mind.

15:52.640 --> 15:55.280
Because I watched the Pac-Man eat all these dots

15:56.320 --> 15:58.240
and I'm excited for him,

15:58.240 --> 16:00.400
but you do it enough and you start to get jealous

16:00.400 --> 16:02.400
because you start to wonder what do they-

16:02.400 --> 16:03.040
What do they taste like?

16:03.040 --> 16:03.840
What do they taste like?

16:03.840 --> 16:05.440
What is the texture like?

16:05.440 --> 16:07.920
How is he not, is he not getting full?

16:07.920 --> 16:09.600
I've made him eat so many of these dots.

16:09.600 --> 16:10.480
Are they not filling?

16:10.480 --> 16:12.000
Are they like little pop chips?

16:12.000 --> 16:15.360
I always assumed they were like corn pops,

16:15.360 --> 16:16.640
like the cereal corn pops.

16:16.640 --> 16:18.160
That's what I imagine they tasted like.

16:19.120 --> 16:22.240
You get jealous from seeing the dots

16:22.240 --> 16:24.240
and then soon that turns into anger

16:24.240 --> 16:28.560
and then you just run Pac-Man right into those murderous ghouls

16:28.560 --> 16:32.080
just so he can feel this thing of death

16:32.080 --> 16:34.160
and you can feel some sort of release

16:34.160 --> 16:37.440
from this cycle of jealousy that you're stuck in.

16:37.440 --> 16:39.200
You don't know how to get to the dots,

16:39.200 --> 16:41.520
but at least you know Pac-Man is not going to eat them all

16:41.520 --> 16:42.800
before you figure it out.

16:42.800 --> 16:44.640
Right, you need to leave those dots.

16:44.640 --> 16:46.240
Do you think the dots are maybe

16:46.240 --> 16:48.480
like some kind of prescription medication

16:48.480 --> 16:50.400
that Pac-Man has to take?

16:50.400 --> 16:53.280
I cannot imagine a dosage, a doctor in the world

16:53.280 --> 16:55.440
that would prescribe a dosage that's just like

16:55.440 --> 16:58.160
as many as you can eat before the ghosts kill you.

16:58.160 --> 16:59.280
Can I ask a question?

16:59.840 --> 17:00.340
Yeah.

17:01.760 --> 17:04.400
Can I do a smash on the monitor to get the dots out?

17:05.760 --> 17:06.320
How do you mean?

17:06.320 --> 17:10.080
Think of the arcade cabinet for Pac-Man.

17:10.080 --> 17:11.760
Okay, slow down, slow down.

17:11.760 --> 17:14.000
Okay, you have start button, you have coin slot,

17:14.000 --> 17:16.400
you have Pac-Man move stick,

17:16.400 --> 17:18.720
and that's more or less it,

17:18.720 --> 17:21.680
and then you have the art and you can't eat that,

17:21.680 --> 17:23.520
and then you have the monitor

17:23.520 --> 17:25.840
and that's where the game lives inside of that.

17:25.840 --> 17:26.340
Yes.

17:26.340 --> 17:32.160
And it just seems like if this person wants to get the dots off monitor,

17:32.160 --> 17:35.520
you need to get in the monitor somehow.

17:35.520 --> 17:38.800
So if you wait, and I think you do it at the beginning of the level

17:38.800 --> 17:42.880
when there are the most dots and the fewest ghosts,

17:42.880 --> 17:44.080
because that's the problem.

17:44.080 --> 17:46.640
You can do a big smash right on the monitor

17:46.640 --> 17:51.040
and get all the dots out and be careful of the ghosts.

17:51.040 --> 17:53.840
That's the only problem I plan as I'm seeing it right now.

17:54.640 --> 17:59.040
If I smash up the monitor with my big fist and then I get those.

17:59.040 --> 18:02.160
If you wreck it.

18:02.160 --> 18:04.080
Yeah, and I get those dots out,

18:04.960 --> 18:07.840
are the ghosts gonna get me?

18:08.480 --> 18:10.000
Is Pac-Man gonna get you?

18:10.000 --> 18:12.080
If I was Pac-Man, I'd be very upset that you did that

18:12.080 --> 18:13.200
and took my dots away.

18:13.200 --> 18:15.200
Yeah, you got into this natural environment

18:15.200 --> 18:18.560
and you took his food away, and Pac-Man's a big wild beast.

18:18.560 --> 18:21.040
You know, fuck, I've been watching a lot of Blue Planet

18:21.040 --> 18:22.560
and you make an excellent point, Gervin,

18:22.560 --> 18:24.320
in that yes, Pac-Man wants to eat the dots,

18:24.320 --> 18:25.840
but the ghosts want to eat Pac-Man.

18:25.840 --> 18:27.920
I should be rooting for the ghosts here.

18:27.920 --> 18:30.000
It's the circle of life.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.560
Yeah, those ghosts have to eat and obviously they didn't

18:32.560 --> 18:34.080
and that's why they already died.

18:34.080 --> 18:35.520
And we should even talk about the fact that

18:35.520 --> 18:38.160
how did Pinky and Blinky and Inky and Stinky and all them

18:38.160 --> 18:40.400
get killed in a terrible passion?

18:40.960 --> 18:42.720
Then the game never really explores that.

18:42.720 --> 18:43.360
Like they were just like-

18:43.360 --> 18:45.760
They're actually the ghosts of every Mario and Luigi

18:45.760 --> 18:47.840
who's died in a Mario game.

18:47.840 --> 18:48.400
Whoa.

18:48.400 --> 18:48.800
Whoa, damn.

18:48.800 --> 18:49.840
Yeah, crossover.

18:49.840 --> 18:50.640
Hank, big news.

18:50.640 --> 18:52.480
I don't wanna talk about Pac-Man anymore.

18:52.480 --> 18:54.400
What about, but I didn't even get to my whole thing

18:54.400 --> 18:56.880
about Adam Sandler's pixels, Justin.

18:56.880 --> 18:59.040
I didn't even get to talk about pixels.

18:59.040 --> 19:00.320
Isn't you say that?

19:00.320 --> 19:01.760
Doesn't that cover it?

19:01.760 --> 19:02.260
Yes.

19:04.880 --> 19:07.600
Back when I was about seven, I was at a dinner in my hometown.

19:10.800 --> 19:12.320
Just the one in in there.

19:12.960 --> 19:13.600
One more again.

19:15.440 --> 19:18.720
Back when I was about seven, I was at a diner in my hometown

19:18.720 --> 19:23.280
and I was enjoying a crisp tasty water with a lemon wedge.

19:23.280 --> 19:26.000
Hey folks, this is a quick break from me to you.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.520
When you get a drink at a restaurant,

19:28.240 --> 19:30.640
even if you're getting a soda,

19:30.640 --> 19:33.120
go ahead and ask a lemon wedge in there.

19:33.120 --> 19:35.360
You're gonna be shocked at how much that spices up

19:35.360 --> 19:37.120
that cola or water.

19:37.120 --> 19:39.120
It's a real treat.

19:39.120 --> 19:40.560
And sometimes it may look a little funny

19:40.560 --> 19:41.440
if you ask for it with that coke,

19:41.440 --> 19:42.640
but trust me on this one.

19:43.760 --> 19:45.840
I remember taking the lemon wedge out, tasting it

19:45.840 --> 19:47.760
and saying to no one in particular,

19:47.760 --> 19:48.720
I love lemons.

19:49.360 --> 19:51.920
A complete stranger leaned over to me and said,

19:51.920 --> 19:54.880
if you eat too many lemons in a day, you'll die.

19:54.880 --> 19:56.560
And then turn back to their meal.

19:56.560 --> 19:59.200
To this day, I can't enjoy a nice lemon

19:59.200 --> 20:01.680
without the thought of imminent death looming over me.

20:02.240 --> 20:04.800
Why did this complete stranger say this to me?

20:04.800 --> 20:06.480
What do they know that we don't?

20:06.480 --> 20:10.240
And how can I finally get back to my pre-lemon fearing days

20:10.240 --> 20:11.840
and that's from lemon dread.

20:11.840 --> 20:13.120
The thing about it is,

20:13.120 --> 20:15.680
if you eat too much of anything, you'll die.

20:15.680 --> 20:19.280
Because how are we defining too much?

20:19.280 --> 20:23.120
And I would submit it's the number it takes to kill you.

20:23.120 --> 20:27.680
Like that's too much lemons would kill you.

20:27.680 --> 20:32.080
So yes, but too much of like waffles.

20:32.080 --> 20:32.480
Not me.

20:32.480 --> 20:34.720
Serrano peppers, marmalade.

20:35.760 --> 20:37.920
I could eat a million lemons and not-

20:37.920 --> 20:38.800
You could eat a million lemons.

20:38.800 --> 20:39.600
How many lemons?

20:39.600 --> 20:41.920
Okay, do you think you could eat enough lemons

20:41.920 --> 20:44.320
to kill you before you passed out?

20:46.480 --> 20:48.160
This is a weird line that I don't know

20:48.160 --> 20:49.840
necessarily what to explore.

20:49.840 --> 20:52.640
This body horror, this seven-esque gluttony.

20:52.640 --> 20:53.840
Man of earth's fears.

20:53.840 --> 20:54.340
Yeah.

20:56.240 --> 20:56.740
What?

20:57.600 --> 20:59.440
Okay, this person said this

20:59.440 --> 21:03.840
to plant a flag in your memory with their face on it

21:03.840 --> 21:06.480
so that one day you would write into an advice show

21:06.480 --> 21:07.840
and talk about this strange thing

21:07.840 --> 21:09.280
that they said to you one time.

21:09.280 --> 21:10.720
They are your constant.

21:10.720 --> 21:12.800
They are a performance artist is what they are.

21:14.240 --> 21:15.200
This is a very-

21:15.200 --> 21:17.120
You are their most successful exhibit

21:18.560 --> 21:22.000
because I don't think you need to worry about eating a lemon

21:22.000 --> 21:24.800
and passing away from it.

21:24.800 --> 21:27.440
I literally don't know what else to say about this question.

21:27.440 --> 21:28.160
Do you guys-

21:28.160 --> 21:30.800
Do you have any memories from childhood of someone-

21:30.800 --> 21:34.000
I remember once, so I took Ritalin

21:34.000 --> 21:38.400
and then later different versions of ADD medication growing up

21:38.400 --> 21:40.960
and I remember once a health teacher,

21:40.960 --> 21:43.440
mind you, now this is at the time when health teacher

21:43.440 --> 21:45.760
was synonymous with gym coach,

21:45.760 --> 21:49.280
but a health teacher telling me in elementary school

21:49.280 --> 21:52.240
because I took one of my pills without a drink,

21:52.800 --> 21:56.160
told me that if I continued to take pills without a drink,

21:56.160 --> 21:59.920
it would get stuck in my throat and give me throat cancer.

22:01.360 --> 22:01.920
How did that-

22:01.920 --> 22:02.640
Wow.

22:02.640 --> 22:04.800
That's a good health teacher.

22:04.800 --> 22:07.360
Yeah, that's maybe the worst possible subject teacher

22:07.360 --> 22:09.200
to tell you that falsehood.

22:09.200 --> 22:10.000
Yes.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.840
This is the same health teacher I believe that

22:11.840 --> 22:14.400
because I used to write notes on my hand in ink

22:14.400 --> 22:16.800
that I would get ink poisoning.

22:16.800 --> 22:17.760
Hand cancer.

22:17.760 --> 22:19.120
I would get hand cancer.

22:19.120 --> 22:22.400
Sort of a one arrow in their quiver it sounds like.

22:26.000 --> 22:29.040
I wish you had told me how you responded to this person.

22:29.040 --> 22:31.280
That's the thing I really want to know from this story

22:31.280 --> 22:33.120
because if somebody told me this,

22:33.120 --> 22:36.160
I think I would just try to make myself as small as possible

22:36.160 --> 22:38.000
until the situation resolved itself.

22:39.440 --> 22:42.000
They probably react in the same way every child does

22:42.000 --> 22:43.840
appropriately when a stranger talks to them

22:43.840 --> 22:47.840
and it's silence and returning to your business.

22:47.840 --> 22:50.160
People got to be careful what you say to kids.

22:50.160 --> 22:53.200
They remember once I was at Bob Evans farm

22:53.200 --> 22:54.160
and an old man-

22:55.680 --> 22:57.280
Once I was at Bob Evans farm-

22:57.280 --> 23:01.120
You have to start that thing and take a run up to this thing.

23:01.120 --> 23:01.760
I got to start over.

23:01.760 --> 23:02.720
I lost my mo.

23:02.720 --> 23:04.400
I once was at Bob Evans farm

23:04.400 --> 23:07.680
and an old man couldn't get his change

23:07.680 --> 23:08.800
out of the soda machine.

23:09.440 --> 23:12.080
And I went over and I was probably 10

23:12.080 --> 23:14.240
and I went over and I helped this old man.

23:14.240 --> 23:16.480
I got his change out and I handed it to him.

23:16.480 --> 23:18.640
And he said, thanks young man.

23:18.640 --> 23:19.920
I'll dance at your wedding.

23:22.640 --> 23:25.760
And I was like fucking so tripped out

23:25.760 --> 23:26.480
for the rest of the day.

23:26.480 --> 23:28.480
Like, what does he know that I don't?

23:28.480 --> 23:30.000
Why would he say this to me?

23:30.000 --> 23:31.520
How will this old man find me?

23:31.520 --> 23:33.120
How will he know I'm getting married?

23:33.120 --> 23:34.320
I didn't give him my name.

23:34.320 --> 23:35.680
How will he notify me?

23:35.680 --> 23:37.600
And for, I would say like, I mean, I remember,

23:37.600 --> 23:38.880
I'm 37 years old now.

23:38.880 --> 23:41.520
I remember this moment like with perfect clarity

23:41.520 --> 23:44.720
where I was when this adult said this weird shit to me.

23:44.720 --> 23:48.720
Can we please just like say normal things to kids

23:48.720 --> 23:51.280
and reduce our idioms and our metaphors

23:51.280 --> 23:52.240
when talking to children?

23:52.240 --> 23:54.640
Did he turn into a beam of light after he said that

23:54.640 --> 23:55.840
and shoot into the heavens?

23:56.960 --> 23:57.520
No.

23:57.520 --> 23:58.880
Did you see him at your wedding?

23:58.880 --> 24:01.440
Drank his, drank his cherry Coke.

24:01.440 --> 24:02.960
Oh, he would have been long dead.

24:02.960 --> 24:04.400
He was an old, old man

24:04.400 --> 24:07.360
and I was not married for two decades later.

24:07.360 --> 24:08.720
So I'm sure.

24:08.720 --> 24:11.760
Okay, but be honest with me for a second, Justin,

24:11.760 --> 24:13.280
for a second on your wedding day,

24:13.280 --> 24:17.280
if you look, 100% guaranteed, no question,

24:17.920 --> 24:20.400
this is also another vivid memory

24:20.400 --> 24:23.440
is being towards the end of the ceremony

24:23.440 --> 24:25.600
and having the fleeing thought like, huh, didn't see him.

24:28.000 --> 24:31.440
All right, well, enjoy your change, I guess.

24:32.480 --> 24:34.160
And then Sydney transformed.

24:34.960 --> 24:37.760
Yeah, my crane, why?

24:39.040 --> 24:39.600
Is it?

24:39.600 --> 24:40.800
That's what that song is about.

24:40.800 --> 24:44.400
Is it a possible, I think maybe just,

24:45.200 --> 24:47.440
definitely don't talk to a strange child

24:47.440 --> 24:49.600
who says something at a restaurant

24:49.600 --> 24:50.800
in the booth behind you.

24:50.800 --> 24:52.480
Like, I love lemons.

24:52.480 --> 24:55.280
That was the thing that activated this person's mind

24:55.280 --> 24:56.800
to say like, my turn to speak.

24:56.800 --> 24:57.920
Like, that's wild.

24:59.600 --> 25:02.560
We were at a grocery store yesterday

25:02.560 --> 25:04.800
and they had a cart at the front that had,

25:04.800 --> 25:06.400
I had never seen these before.

25:06.400 --> 25:09.840
They had a two, like a plastic seat in the front

25:09.840 --> 25:11.760
so that you could strap two kids into.

25:11.760 --> 25:14.000
It elongated it by about a foot and a half.

25:14.000 --> 25:17.040
So piloting it is a utter disaster.

25:17.040 --> 25:18.240
And it's designed for two children,

25:18.240 --> 25:20.880
but Charlie saw it was like, hell yeah, yeah, absolutely.

25:20.880 --> 25:24.080
I think I'm gonna ride in that weird carnival shopping cart.

25:24.080 --> 25:25.200
And we didn't want to

25:25.200 --> 25:26.480
because they're miserable to push around.

25:26.480 --> 25:27.600
And also she's one child

25:27.600 --> 25:29.200
and I couldn't deal with the pressure

25:29.200 --> 25:32.000
of people looking at me like, huh, two seater for one kid.

25:32.000 --> 25:32.800
Interesting.

25:32.800 --> 25:34.080
So we were arguing with her for,

25:34.880 --> 25:37.840
it felt like about three hours trying to get her out.

25:37.840 --> 25:40.720
And this other woman who had a daughter

25:40.720 --> 25:44.240
roughly Charlie's age leaned over to Charlie and said,

25:44.240 --> 25:45.600
actually that one's got a flat tire.

25:46.400 --> 25:48.560
And that worked instantly.

25:48.560 --> 25:51.680
And that woman is my true homie for life.

25:51.680 --> 25:53.120
I tried to give her a blood debt

25:53.120 --> 25:55.680
and she was, I didn't know exactly how it worked.

25:55.680 --> 25:57.440
So I ended up just kind of walking away.

25:57.440 --> 25:59.600
But like, I will never forget this person.

25:59.600 --> 26:01.280
And that is a rare instance where like,

26:01.840 --> 26:03.680
maybe this person of what I'm getting at

26:03.680 --> 26:06.800
is maybe this person saw something on your parents face

26:06.800 --> 26:09.120
where it's like, again with the fucking lemons.

26:09.120 --> 26:12.640
This kid always eats lemons and it's so weird.

26:12.640 --> 26:14.400
And the person at the other table was like,

26:14.400 --> 26:16.160
no problem, I have got your back.

26:16.160 --> 26:16.800
But they didn't.

26:17.440 --> 26:19.440
Let me take care of this one for you.

26:19.440 --> 26:21.680
I have just the right thing to say.

26:21.680 --> 26:23.520
And then they went back to their home

26:23.520 --> 26:24.800
and they looked in the magic mirror

26:24.800 --> 26:26.080
and they said, am I free yet?

26:26.640 --> 26:27.760
Am I free from the curse?

26:27.760 --> 26:29.360
Have I saved another child?

26:29.360 --> 26:30.960
They went back to their orange farm.

26:30.960 --> 26:32.880
It was like, fuck yeah, I did it again.

26:32.880 --> 26:33.440
Another one.

26:34.160 --> 26:35.680
No, we got another one guys.

26:35.680 --> 26:37.760
We're gonna be king of citrus mountain before you know it.

26:37.760 --> 26:40.800
Are you saying that oranges and lemons

26:40.800 --> 26:44.560
are competitors in some way?

26:44.560 --> 26:47.200
They occupy two completely different

26:47.200 --> 26:49.440
sort of eating experience fields.

26:49.440 --> 26:52.960
What I'm saying is if the custom was to have an orange slice

26:52.960 --> 26:55.040
on top of every fancy drink you ever had,

26:55.040 --> 26:57.120
that'd be a pretty good day for the orange people.

26:57.120 --> 26:58.560
We've got blue moon.

26:58.560 --> 26:59.760
How do we expand?

27:00.320 --> 27:01.760
We could get into water.

27:01.760 --> 27:04.640
No, everybody knows what goes, wait, yeah?

27:04.640 --> 27:05.680
I've got an idea.

27:05.680 --> 27:07.840
What if little guerrilla marketing.

27:08.400 --> 27:11.040
Yeah, we tell people.

27:11.040 --> 27:12.880
I go from soda fountain to soda fountain

27:12.880 --> 27:14.880
just yelling that lemons are bad.

27:14.880 --> 27:16.640
Yeah, it sounds a pretty good idea, Mark.

27:16.640 --> 27:17.760
Get out there, Mark.

27:17.760 --> 27:18.560
Get out there, Mark.

27:18.560 --> 27:19.920
You start and we'll follow you.

27:19.920 --> 27:20.800
Grassroots, Mark.

27:21.520 --> 27:22.160
Street team.

27:22.800 --> 27:24.880
You're gonna take a quick break now.

27:25.600 --> 27:27.440
Get our duckets in a row.

27:27.440 --> 27:29.280
That's not saying, anyway, it's somebody's-

27:29.280 --> 27:29.920
I liked it though.

27:29.920 --> 27:31.360
It was almost a turn of phrase.

27:31.360 --> 27:46.400
Yeah, I want to tell everybody all about me on these me on these.

27:46.400 --> 27:49.360
They make underwear for TMI, man.

27:49.360 --> 27:52.960
Yeah, I don't get it.

27:52.960 --> 27:53.760
Yeah, what's TMI?

27:55.440 --> 27:58.240
Too many ideas.

27:58.240 --> 27:59.760
So that's worse.

27:59.760 --> 28:00.880
That's worse.

28:00.880 --> 28:02.960
Yeah, so no, no, no.

28:02.960 --> 28:04.000
Hold on now.

28:04.000 --> 28:05.360
Give us another one.

28:05.360 --> 28:06.160
We got to move on.

28:06.160 --> 28:07.200
We got to move on too many.

28:07.200 --> 28:09.440
And I don't want to have to do another make good like last week.

28:10.640 --> 28:14.240
Me on these offers the just the most comfortable underwear of all time.

28:14.240 --> 28:18.400

28:18.400 --> 28:22.400

You and your boss.

28:23.360 --> 28:24.880
No, no, your boss.

28:24.880 --> 28:26.640
No, no, no, your principal.

28:38.800 --> 28:42.640
We have a couple of matching pairs from me on these, and it's a lot of fun.

28:42.640 --> 28:43.200
Wait, hold on.

28:43.840 --> 28:44.320
We do?

28:45.120 --> 28:49.520
No, I mean, okay.

28:50.480 --> 28:52.720
And they're really fun to wear.

28:52.720 --> 28:57.040
I also like right now, actually, I'm wearing their lounge pants, which I don't think are

28:57.040 --> 29:01.280
included in this particular bullet point, but I can't say enough about these very comfortable

29:01.280 --> 29:01.840
lounge pants.

29:02.400 --> 29:04.800
All of it's made from the softest materials on Earth.

29:04.800 --> 29:07.360
They're talking three times softer than cotton soft.

29:07.360 --> 29:10.240
This Valentine's Day, get your partner a fun, thoughtful gift that's comfortable for the

29:10.240 --> 29:11.040

29:43.120 --> 29:43.840
Good job, Griffin.

29:43.840 --> 29:45.360
Oh, come on, please.

29:46.960 --> 29:48.560
Please, you flatter me.

29:51.840 --> 29:52.960
Trav, do you want to read this one?

29:52.960 --> 29:53.920
Sure, I do.

29:53.920 --> 29:56.560
Postage rates have gone up again.

29:57.840 --> 29:58.640
That's all it says.

29:59.280 --> 29:59.680
Weird.

30:00.720 --> 30:02.160
Anyways, Let's Stamps.

30:02.160 --> 30:03.600
Let's move on to the next one.

30:03.600 --> 30:03.840
Yeah.

30:05.280 --> 30:09.040
My name is Greg Williamson with a special message on my brother.

30:09.040 --> 30:09.920
My brother and me.

30:09.920 --> 30:12.320
Postage rates have gone up again.

30:12.320 --> 30:12.640
Bye.

30:14.160 --> 30:18.160
Letstamps.com keep your rates down with postage discounts up to 40%.

30:18.880 --> 30:21.360
Discounts you can't even get at the post office.

30:21.360 --> 30:26.000
Buy and print official US postage for any letter, package, and class of mail using your

30:26.000 --> 30:27.440
own computer and printer.

30:27.440 --> 30:28.960
Then the mail carrier picks it up.

30:28.960 --> 30:30.240
No more trips to the post office.

30:31.120 --> 30:32.080
Wham bam.

30:32.080 --> 30:32.880
Totally done.

30:32.880 --> 30:33.280
Easy.

30:34.960 --> 30:37.440
You won't have to worry about letters anymore.

30:38.320 --> 30:40.880
Well, I don't spend that much time worrying about letters.

30:40.880 --> 30:45.280
Oh, it's like every day, three hours a day in one solid chunk.

30:45.280 --> 30:48.000
Start to finish one o'clock to four o'clock every day.

30:48.000 --> 30:49.440
What am I going to do with these letters?

30:50.160 --> 30:51.120
And now I know.

30:51.120 --> 30:51.920
Stamps.com.

30:52.800 --> 30:54.080
You can enjoy the Stamps.com.

That's Stamps.com.

31:04.560 --> 31:05.520
Enter my brother.

31:07.840 --> 31:08.080
What?

31:09.760 --> 31:10.720
Enter my brother.

31:12.400 --> 31:13.200
Just gross.

31:13.200 --> 31:15.040
No, I meant like an Osmosis Jones way.

31:16.880 --> 31:19.200
I have a message here.

31:19.200 --> 31:20.800
Oh, it's about Sedgwick.

31:20.800 --> 31:22.560
You know what I said, Nick?

31:22.560 --> 31:23.360
You said Sedgwick.

31:24.000 --> 31:24.560
No, I didn't.

31:24.560 --> 31:25.600
I said Sedgwick.

31:25.600 --> 31:26.480
Thank you, Travis.

31:26.480 --> 31:28.080
It's a dream folk band.

31:28.080 --> 31:28.560
Start over.

31:28.560 --> 31:28.960
Start over.

31:28.960 --> 31:29.360
I fucked it.

31:29.360 --> 31:30.640
Why do I have to start over?

31:30.640 --> 31:31.440
You're the one that sucks.

31:31.440 --> 31:32.560
Yeah, I'm the one who fucked it up.

31:33.600 --> 31:35.120
So I'm not starting over.

31:35.120 --> 31:36.880
What word did I leave off on?

31:36.880 --> 31:37.520
Band.

31:37.520 --> 31:39.120
Based in Chicago, Illinois.

31:39.760 --> 31:42.640
Sedgwick is a dream folk band based in Chicago, Illinois.

31:42.640 --> 31:48.560
Using their roots in folk music and influences from alt rock and electronica, Sedgwick explores

31:48.560 --> 31:52.480
emotionally stirring themes via complex vocal harmonies and sweeping symphonic soundscapes

31:52.480 --> 31:56.880
that has been described as haunting, evocative, beautiful music by WGN Radio.

31:56.880 --> 32:01.280
Listen to the album, Collapse Now, and find Sedgwick on social media.

32:01.280 --> 32:05.600
That's at S-E-D-G-E-W-I-C-K.

32:05.600 --> 32:06.080
Band.

32:06.640 --> 32:07.760
That's their Twitter handle.

32:07.760 --> 32:09.840
Listen to Sedgwick's full-length studio album.

32:09.840 --> 32:10.800
I did say full-length.

32:10.800 --> 32:12.640
And you also did say Sedgwick that time.

32:12.640 --> 32:13.680
That was Sedgwick.

32:13.680 --> 32:14.720
That one was Sedgwick.

32:14.720 --> 32:15.600
It's Sedgwick.

32:15.600 --> 32:18.800
Listen to Sedgwick's...

32:18.800 --> 32:24.960
Listen to Sedgwick's full-length studio album, Collapse, on Spotify, SoundCloud, iTunes,

32:24.960 --> 32:27.760
and find out more at Sedgwickmusic.com.

32:27.760 --> 32:29.360
Okay, I figured out the problem.

32:29.360 --> 32:31.200
Listen to Sedgwick's full-length...

32:31.200 --> 32:32.240
Sedgwick.

32:32.240 --> 32:32.480
Sedgwick.

32:32.480 --> 32:34.640
Do you like music?

32:34.640 --> 32:35.440
Sedgwick, we're very sorry.

32:35.440 --> 32:37.840
Sedgwick sounds like you're saying Sedgwick with a baby accent.

32:37.840 --> 32:39.280
And I understand that now.

32:39.280 --> 32:40.080
I get it.

32:40.080 --> 32:41.120
And that's not on Sedgwick.

32:41.120 --> 32:42.240
It's a great name.

32:42.240 --> 32:46.000
And this music does sound evocative and powerful.

32:46.000 --> 32:47.760
It's just we fucked it up.

32:47.760 --> 32:49.680
And then we kind of went down our own little hole.

32:49.680 --> 32:52.560
We made the hole, and then we were baby people, and we made a hole.

32:52.560 --> 32:53.520
You'll remember it now.

32:53.520 --> 32:55.440
It's Sedgwick, not Cedric.

32:56.160 --> 32:58.160
And I'm not speaking with a baby accent.

32:58.160 --> 32:59.200
They're two different words.

33:01.520 --> 33:04.160
I have a message here for Jessica, and it's from Graham, who says,

33:04.160 --> 33:07.440
Dearest Magpie, you're the best thing that ever happened to me.

33:07.440 --> 33:13.440
I'm so lucky to have you as my partner, best friend, wife, and baby mama.

33:13.440 --> 33:17.440
Why are we all incapable of reading these like normal human beings?

33:18.400 --> 33:20.800
My best friend, wife, and baby mama.

33:21.360 --> 33:24.320
I'm grateful you said I will all those years ago.

33:24.320 --> 33:27.120
Thank you for being mine, for the family we've chosen and built,

33:27.120 --> 33:28.400
and for all our days together.

33:28.400 --> 33:30.160
Love forever and always.

33:30.160 --> 33:30.800
G.

33:30.800 --> 33:31.360
P.S.

33:31.360 --> 33:31.920
Great job.

33:32.880 --> 33:34.320
I didn't even say that part right.

33:34.880 --> 33:35.200
Okay.

33:35.200 --> 33:39.120
Okay, Jessica, Graham, congratulations on your momentous love,

33:39.120 --> 33:41.280
and it's the kind of stuff that's gonna move mountains.

33:41.280 --> 33:42.480
That's all I have to say about that.

33:42.480 --> 33:45.440
And it's, I'm really glad that Jessica, when asked,

33:45.440 --> 33:48.480
will you help me hide this body, said I will.

33:48.480 --> 33:49.360
Yeah, sure.

33:49.360 --> 33:51.360
She's always down.

33:51.360 --> 33:53.200
She knows the best spots.

33:54.080 --> 33:55.040
She knows the game.

33:56.240 --> 33:57.360
Griffin, read this one too.

33:57.360 --> 33:59.040
You just keep doing such a good job reading.

33:59.920 --> 34:02.320
Let me prepare, let me moisten my instrument.

34:02.320 --> 34:07.520
Oh, God.

34:07.520 --> 34:09.760
Were you reacting to your own phrase there?

34:10.320 --> 34:11.040
Yeah.

34:11.040 --> 34:13.840
Here's one for Jay, and it's from Tosca, who says,

34:13.840 --> 34:16.000
hey, Jay, happy belated candle nights.

34:16.000 --> 34:17.600
Those are pretty belated candle nights.

34:17.600 --> 34:19.600
Thank you for being one of my,

34:19.600 --> 34:22.400
thank you for being one of my close friends,

34:22.400 --> 34:24.480
and introducing me to these good, good brothers

34:24.480 --> 34:25.280
and the adventure zone.

34:25.280 --> 34:29.280
Looking forward to more gaming hijinks, dumb references, and memes,

34:29.280 --> 34:33.120
childhood crime stories, and hotel wrestle battles.

34:33.120 --> 34:34.000
Love you, dork.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.560
P.S., is this why you wanted me to read this one?

34:36.560 --> 34:37.200
It is, yes.

34:39.120 --> 34:41.200
Oh my wa mo shinderu.

34:42.080 --> 34:44.080
That's, you are already dead,

34:44.080 --> 34:46.160
and I believe it's from Fist of the North Star.

34:46.880 --> 34:47.200
Okay.

34:48.560 --> 34:50.480
That one, that one, that's fine.

34:50.480 --> 34:51.200
That one's fine.

34:51.200 --> 34:52.160
That one's not, yeah.

34:52.800 --> 34:54.640
Oh my wa mo shinderu.

34:54.640 --> 34:56.000
I'm sorry, everybody.

34:56.000 --> 34:57.920
Did you include that so that one of us would say it

34:57.920 --> 35:00.080
and then get dunked on on Twitter by people who are like,

35:00.080 --> 35:01.280
nah, that's actually,

35:01.280 --> 35:06.080
you've mispronounced the Fist of the North Star quote so badly,

35:06.080 --> 35:08.720
and now I'm boycotting the show.

35:11.680 --> 35:12.640
I'm Hal Loveland.

35:12.640 --> 35:13.520
I'm Danielle Radford.

35:13.520 --> 35:14.560
I am Michael Eagle.

35:14.560 --> 35:16.160
And we are the hosts of Tights and Fights,

35:16.160 --> 35:19.920
Maximum Fund's newest podcast dedicated to all things wrestling.

35:19.920 --> 35:22.800
We'll be talking about Sasha Banks, the women's revolution,

35:22.800 --> 35:26.240
Sasha Banks, the brand split, and Sasha Banks' wigs.

35:26.240 --> 35:28.640
And we'll also be talking about wrestler fashion.

35:28.640 --> 35:30.560
Some wrestlers wear too many clothes.

35:30.560 --> 35:32.400
Some wrestlers don't wear enough clothes at all.

35:32.400 --> 35:35.840
And I'll be doing impressions of all your favorite wrestlers.

35:35.840 --> 35:38.720
New episodes Thursdays on Maximum Fund

35:38.720 --> 35:40.720
or wherever you get your podcasts.

35:40.720 --> 35:41.760
Oh yeah.

35:41.760 --> 35:42.240
Dig it.

35:53.040 --> 35:55.120
Here's a Yahoo that was sent in by Morgan Davey.

35:55.120 --> 35:56.240
Keep it wavy, Morgan Davey.

35:56.240 --> 35:57.360
It's from Yahoo Answers user.

35:57.360 --> 36:00.720
Sorry, something has gone wrong, but I'm going to refresh it.

36:00.720 --> 36:03.040
And then it's still wrong.

36:03.040 --> 36:05.920
So I'm going to say this is Flo from Progressive Insurance.

36:07.360 --> 36:10.160
If you could speak as soon as you were born,

36:10.160 --> 36:11.840
what would you first words be?

36:12.720 --> 36:14.400
You've just been born.

36:14.400 --> 36:16.480
What are your first words you say?

36:16.480 --> 36:17.360
Thanks.

36:17.360 --> 36:20.880
And Justin, I know that this is something hot on your mind.

36:20.880 --> 36:21.360
Yeah.

36:21.360 --> 36:23.920
Is it strange that we haven't discussed the fact

36:23.920 --> 36:27.600
that in like five days or four days,

36:27.600 --> 36:29.360
you and Sydney are expecting?

36:30.000 --> 36:31.520
It's nobody's business.

36:31.520 --> 36:33.600
I guess that's, I mean, it's going to be our listeners business

36:33.600 --> 36:36.960
because we're going to have a live show for you next week

36:36.960 --> 36:38.880
because Justin's taking some time off.

36:40.320 --> 36:42.000
Yeah, just for the baby stuff.

36:43.360 --> 36:45.040
Yeah, new baby coming.

36:46.560 --> 36:47.520
New baby coming.

36:48.080 --> 36:49.280
Drops this Tuesday.

36:49.280 --> 36:53.280
I wanted to do, I wanted to reveal it on Insta,

36:53.280 --> 36:53.840
but I guess.

36:57.600 --> 36:59.600
All right, are you going to do like a name reveal?

36:59.600 --> 37:02.240
Like a Kim Kardashian den?

37:02.240 --> 37:03.760
It's actually Jeremy Jivens.

37:03.760 --> 37:04.880
Yeah, that's very exciting.

37:06.160 --> 37:08.960
So what is the, if you speak as soon as you're born

37:08.960 --> 37:12.080
and you are able to speak and you've just been born

37:12.080 --> 37:18.080
and you pop right out and then what's the first words?

37:18.080 --> 37:19.360
What if babies could do this?

37:19.360 --> 37:22.000
What if babies had nine months to think of like

37:22.000 --> 37:25.520
a dope entrance line, but then they couldn't speak again

37:25.520 --> 37:27.680
for, you know, 18 months or whatever

37:27.680 --> 37:30.720
following sort of the natural order of things.

37:30.720 --> 37:33.040
Oh man, wouldn't that suck if you popped out and you're like,

37:33.040 --> 37:36.880
I'm so happy to boo here, fuck, I blew it.

37:38.080 --> 37:38.720
Yeah.

37:38.720 --> 37:39.920
What if they just popped out and said,

37:39.920 --> 37:41.360
I like it, do what?

37:42.000 --> 37:45.440
Oh my God, Travis, it's the best answer.

37:45.440 --> 37:47.520
It's fair, it's a very good answer.

37:47.520 --> 37:48.480
Ah, shit.

37:51.120 --> 37:53.840
Before we jump in, I wanted to read a couple of these answers

37:53.840 --> 37:55.840
because this is the most disappointed I've ever been

37:55.840 --> 37:58.880
in Yahoo, I think, and that's saying something

37:58.880 --> 38:01.120
because even when I'm not doing this podcast

38:01.120 --> 38:03.840
or interacting with this website,

38:03.840 --> 38:06.800
I am experiencing what I would call just sort of

38:06.800 --> 38:12.160
a constant low frequency disappointment at Yahoo Answers.

38:12.960 --> 38:14.400
This is the best answer.

38:14.400 --> 38:16.160
It was voted best answer.

38:16.160 --> 38:19.200
It's from Abby who says, please put me back in.

38:19.200 --> 38:21.520
I don't want to come into this world, you can't make me.

38:23.600 --> 38:24.640
That's the best answer.

38:26.000 --> 38:29.600
Two answers down, Jim G, not the best answer.

38:30.320 --> 38:32.960
Sorry I'm late, I hit some traffic in the birth canal.

38:32.960 --> 38:33.520
Hey mom.

38:34.480 --> 38:36.400
Hey mom, I like the hey mom at the end.

38:36.400 --> 38:37.920
Wait, hey mom's very good.

38:37.920 --> 38:41.120
Because that makes it seem like the baby is addressing

38:41.680 --> 38:44.320
the doctor first, like, yo, sorry I'm late.

38:44.320 --> 38:45.600
Oh, hey mom.

38:45.600 --> 38:47.520
It addresses two different audiences.

38:47.520 --> 38:50.800
It's a pretty good little joke construction there, Jim G,

38:50.800 --> 38:52.400
but it's not the best answer.

38:52.400 --> 38:53.680
No, Abby's is.

38:53.680 --> 38:57.040
The best answer is the first one every 90s comedian

38:57.040 --> 38:59.040
would think of, put me back.

38:59.040 --> 39:00.800
It's not, it's nothing.

39:00.800 --> 39:05.200
What if you, I think, okay, for this example,

39:05.200 --> 39:08.560
I would have to think like me now as a baby being born,

39:09.120 --> 39:10.400
because if the baby was just born,

39:10.400 --> 39:11.440
sure they could speak English,

39:11.440 --> 39:12.480
they wouldn't know what anything is.

39:12.480 --> 39:14.800
So that doesn't work for the joke construction.

39:14.800 --> 39:18.320
So I would wait for some good entrance line, right?

39:18.320 --> 39:21.920
That I could respond to where like, they would say like-

39:21.920 --> 39:22.400
That's good.

39:23.120 --> 39:24.160
Okay, he's coming.

39:24.160 --> 39:26.400
And I'd pop out and be like, that's what she said.

39:26.400 --> 39:27.280
You know, something like that.

39:27.280 --> 39:28.960
Okay, so kind of like what up at the moment.

39:28.960 --> 39:29.520
Yeah.

39:29.520 --> 39:30.480
That's, I like that.

39:30.480 --> 39:32.720
Something where I can respond, like pop out and be like,

39:34.480 --> 39:35.760
I'll have what she's having.

39:35.760 --> 39:38.560
You know, something like that where I can really respond

39:38.560 --> 39:40.240
and nail the timing.

39:40.240 --> 39:42.800
Yeah, if your mom is like moaning from labor pains

39:42.800 --> 39:44.800
and then you come out and you're like, I'll have what she's having.

39:44.800 --> 39:45.680
Like that would be pretty funny for a baby.

39:45.680 --> 39:47.520
That could be funny as fuck, dude.

39:47.520 --> 39:51.360
President Bartlett's first words on the West Wing are,

39:51.360 --> 39:52.720
I am the Lord your God,

39:52.720 --> 39:55.120
thou shalt worship no other God before me.

39:55.120 --> 39:58.960
Would that be a good opening salvo for a baby?

39:58.960 --> 39:59.200
Yeah.

39:59.200 --> 40:00.720
That would be very commanding.

40:00.720 --> 40:03.120
You would run the room at that point, I think.

40:03.120 --> 40:06.160
What if it's three triplets all trying to deliver their jokes

40:06.160 --> 40:09.040
at the same time, but the cross talk makes it unbearable.

40:09.040 --> 40:10.400
And then it would be kind of like,

40:10.400 --> 40:14.240
listening to my brother and me as these babies show up

40:14.240 --> 40:18.480
and they're all like, my wife, I'll have what she's having.

40:18.480 --> 40:19.280
I'm the Lord your God.

40:19.280 --> 40:22.320
Like, oh, guys, oh, guys, guys, can we break these up?

40:22.320 --> 40:22.960
Can we separate these?

40:22.960 --> 40:24.720
Can we do one joke per joke, please?

40:25.440 --> 40:27.200
Because you do kind of a Joey Gladstone thing,

40:27.200 --> 40:29.440
like cut it off and you're looking at the umbilical cord.

40:29.440 --> 40:30.880
Oh, I like that.

40:30.880 --> 40:31.920
Is that fun?

40:31.920 --> 40:34.000
What if you went really topical?

40:34.000 --> 40:36.240
Because like here's the thing, you're only going to do it once

40:36.240 --> 40:37.600
and you popped out and like,

40:37.600 --> 40:39.440
did you guys see The Late Show last night?

40:39.440 --> 40:41.440
And you just made it like really specific,

40:41.440 --> 40:44.240
but a good conversation starter too, a good icebreaker.

40:45.040 --> 40:45.600
That's good.

40:46.560 --> 40:47.600
I think I know what mine would be.

40:48.640 --> 40:52.400
First, I'm going to look at the webcam in the nursery,

40:52.400 --> 40:53.360
make sure the baby's not asleep.

40:53.360 --> 40:54.320
Okay, he's not.

40:54.320 --> 41:01.440
I think the seed hits the egg and then I exist while I'm taking...

41:02.160 --> 41:04.240
Wait, hold on, let me think about what I'm saying.

41:04.240 --> 41:05.040
Uh-huh.

41:05.040 --> 41:05.360
What?

41:05.360 --> 41:06.960
No, listen, life begins at conception.

41:06.960 --> 41:08.320
No!

41:08.320 --> 41:10.880
Hey, listen, one thing we want to establish here on our podcast.

41:10.880 --> 41:11.520
Okay, hold on.

41:11.520 --> 41:12.800
What is it?

41:12.800 --> 41:15.920
With 393 episodes in, it should be clear by now.

41:16.560 --> 41:19.120
The one thing I want is for our podcast to be entered as evidence

41:19.120 --> 41:20.960
in a Supreme Court deliberations.

41:20.960 --> 41:24.160
What do you want to go ahead and establish here, biblically speaking?

41:28.160 --> 41:30.560
Surprise, you finally got to the twist.

41:30.560 --> 41:32.640
You finally got to the twist of our podcast.

41:32.640 --> 41:36.320
Every 390 fucking episodes, it's the twist, the turn.

41:36.320 --> 41:41.440
I'm just saying, I have the thought, I know what I'm going to say,

41:41.440 --> 41:42.560
and then it's just waiting.

41:42.560 --> 41:46.640
The long, dark, damp wait, and it's just like,

41:46.640 --> 41:48.240
oh, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready.

41:48.240 --> 41:51.440
And then out I come as soon as the crown is out.

41:51.440 --> 41:52.800
I think I'm not even fully delivered.

41:52.800 --> 42:00.720
You hear me yelling, my name is Kid Rock!

42:00.720 --> 42:02.640
And then I'm like, is Kid Rock still cool?

42:02.640 --> 42:05.120
And then the baby magic wears off, I can't talk anymore.

42:05.120 --> 42:06.640
But I didn't know.

42:06.640 --> 42:09.760
No, Kid Rock, we don't really fuck around with Kid Rock.

42:09.760 --> 42:11.840
That would be so dope if you got that far,

42:11.840 --> 42:16.960
and then when you were two and a half, or three, or however old,

42:16.960 --> 42:19.520
your first words were, Kid Rock!

42:20.160 --> 42:23.280
That's such a long time for the drop to come, but it's so worth it.

42:23.280 --> 42:27.520
It's so, well, it's kind of worth it.

42:27.520 --> 42:28.880
It's a little bit worth it.

42:28.880 --> 42:32.960
Could you get to, what about, I see you tremble with antisa,

42:32.960 --> 42:37.840
and then three years later, patience.

42:37.840 --> 42:38.960
That could be very good, too.

42:40.160 --> 42:41.920
I think that your Tim Curry impression,

42:41.920 --> 42:43.760
I think you'd have time to get good at it in there.

42:46.720 --> 42:49.840
What a fun, I just love make and believe, don't you guys?

42:52.080 --> 42:55.360
Just saying, we got these brains for reasons to make up imaginations.

42:56.400 --> 42:57.920
Beautiful, thank you, Griffin.

42:57.920 --> 43:00.000
Thank you, God, for the imagination you gave me.

43:00.640 --> 43:01.280
Thank you.

43:01.280 --> 43:03.200
What about, I'm the baby, gotta love me.

43:04.080 --> 43:05.680
I'm the baby, gotta love me.

43:05.680 --> 43:06.720
That's so good.

43:06.720 --> 43:07.760
Yeah, that's the one.

43:07.760 --> 43:12.160
I've showed enough videos of Baby Sinclair and Charlie at this point

43:12.160 --> 43:16.400
that she's probably the only three-year-old on planet Earth

43:16.400 --> 43:17.680
that's deeply into dinosaur clips on YouTube.

43:17.680 --> 43:18.800
Why would you do that?

43:19.840 --> 43:21.200
As an experiment, I think.

43:23.120 --> 43:26.160
She got a Baby Sinclair toy for Christmas that we got off of eBay.

43:26.160 --> 43:28.480
It's gotta be one of five left, right?

43:28.480 --> 43:28.960
Yeah, definitely.

43:28.960 --> 43:31.120
That's the one toy I tell her to take really good care of.

43:31.120 --> 43:34.160
Because Daddy probably can't find another Baby Sinclair.

43:34.160 --> 43:38.640
But Justin, Baby Sinclair is a character purely based off of being a baby

43:38.640 --> 43:42.080
who A, does not get along well with not the mama,

43:42.080 --> 43:44.880
and two, is kind of a monster.

43:46.160 --> 43:48.240
If you think she has not come to me and say,

43:48.240 --> 43:51.040
Daddy, let's play the game where I bang on your head,

43:51.040 --> 43:53.440
and then you say, if you bang my head one more time,

43:53.440 --> 43:54.800
I'm gonna throw you across the room,

43:54.800 --> 43:56.240
and then you throw me across the room.

43:57.120 --> 43:58.320
No, sweetie, we're not playing dinosaurs.

43:58.320 --> 43:59.760
Does that happen in dinosaurs?

43:59.760 --> 44:00.960
That happens in dinosaurs.

44:00.960 --> 44:02.240
He throws his child?

44:02.880 --> 44:04.880
He throws his child across the room.

44:04.880 --> 44:05.840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

44:05.840 --> 44:08.160
I've been a dev for about 14 months now.

44:08.880 --> 44:10.800
That's kind of day one stuff.

44:10.800 --> 44:14.560
Yeah, I'm not saying I'm 100%-ing this, but...

44:14.560 --> 44:16.400
It's in one of the great clips.

44:16.400 --> 44:19.200
I mean, if you look at one of the great clips of...

44:19.200 --> 44:20.480
Oh, okay, yeah, just found it.

44:20.480 --> 44:21.200
It's the first result.

44:21.840 --> 44:22.480
Here you go.

44:22.480 --> 44:23.040
We're just gonna...

44:23.040 --> 44:25.360
This is probably the third time we've sent clips

44:25.360 --> 44:27.760
of the hit TV show Dinosaurs to each other.

44:27.760 --> 44:28.960
If you wanna follow along at home,

44:28.960 --> 44:39.680
youtube.com slash watch question mark V equals U for JTG5V capital X, capital Y, capital Q.

44:40.400 --> 44:44.480
And you can see clearly here at the...

44:44.480 --> 44:47.280
It's very obvious at the 17th second mark,

44:47.280 --> 44:50.480
Baby Sinclair is thrown across the room by daddy.

44:50.480 --> 44:52.560
Baby Sinclair is fine,

44:53.360 --> 44:56.000
but that does happen in the hit TV show Dinosaurs.

44:56.000 --> 45:00.160
Does the baby dinosaur and DJ Jazzy Jeff ever run into each other in the air?

45:00.160 --> 45:01.200
Like, it happened again.

45:02.560 --> 45:04.560
That would be so fresh.

45:04.560 --> 45:07.920
And they trade, but he would be killed, right?

45:07.920 --> 45:11.520
DJ Jazzy Jeff would not last long in this dinosaur-filled world.

45:11.520 --> 45:14.720
I don't necessarily think he's got the skills required

45:14.720 --> 45:18.240
to not be destroyed by the dinosaur's powerful jaws.

45:18.800 --> 45:20.320
So should we do another question?

45:20.320 --> 45:21.840
Absolutely.

45:22.640 --> 45:25.840
Hi brothers, I'm very quiet at work and I haven't been there for long.

45:25.840 --> 45:28.800
I'm also much younger than everyone else at only 23.

45:28.800 --> 45:31.440
I sometimes think that my coworkers don't know how to take me.

45:32.160 --> 45:34.240
In a slow part of the day today,

45:34.240 --> 45:37.040
my adult coworkers out of nowhere started assigning everyone

45:37.040 --> 45:39.120
SpongeBob characters based on their personalities.

45:39.120 --> 45:41.200
Jesus fuck, oh my god.

45:41.200 --> 45:43.360
When they got around to me, one of my coworkers yelled,

45:43.360 --> 45:46.240
Krabby Patty, and everyone just agreed?

45:47.200 --> 45:48.960
I'm so concerned as to what this means,

45:48.960 --> 45:51.120
because Krabby Patty isn't a character, thank you.

45:51.920 --> 45:53.520
It's just a sea hamburger?

45:54.080 --> 45:55.280
Should I quit now?

45:55.280 --> 45:55.920
What do I do?

45:56.800 --> 45:59.680
And that's from confused Krabby Patty in Kansas City.

45:59.680 --> 46:01.200
That is very confusing.

46:01.200 --> 46:03.600
I would not know how to take this information either.

46:03.600 --> 46:09.520
Now, is your real name something that rhymes with Krabby Patty,

46:09.520 --> 46:10.880
like Stabby Daddy?

46:10.880 --> 46:15.760
And then it's the rhyme that is just kind of undeniable.

46:15.760 --> 46:17.840
And maybe the boss's name is Bungbob,

46:18.400 --> 46:20.960
and so he of course got that designation.

46:20.960 --> 46:23.840
Bungbob is a pretty good name.

46:23.840 --> 46:27.440
It doesn't rhyme with sponge, but it's still pretty good.

46:27.440 --> 46:29.440
Yeah, but I think it's a slant rhyme.

46:29.440 --> 46:32.800
I think it's pretty good.

46:32.800 --> 46:36.320
Wouldn't Sponge Rob rhyme better with SpongeBob?

46:36.320 --> 46:37.440
I think I'm mistaken.

46:37.440 --> 46:38.560
What about Bungrob?

46:38.560 --> 46:41.680
We rented, there used to be a costume shop in town

46:42.560 --> 46:44.000
for a theater thing once.

46:44.000 --> 46:48.800
We rented an unlicensed SpongeBob square pants costume.

46:48.800 --> 46:52.240
And it was listed in the catalog as Sponge Robert.

46:52.800 --> 46:55.360
Which I think is like, nice, good try.

46:55.360 --> 46:57.120
Please, Sponge Robert was my father.

46:58.640 --> 46:59.600
I'm Bungrob.

47:05.600 --> 47:08.880
You know, actually, there is no true one Bungrob.

47:08.880 --> 47:12.560
It's a title passed down from father to son.

47:13.360 --> 47:15.360
Yeah, that's why at the end of every season

47:15.360 --> 47:16.960
of SpongeBob Squarepants,

47:16.960 --> 47:19.920
he goes through a regeneration and he's voiced by a different actor.

47:19.920 --> 47:23.520
The problem is, it does sound like they were dunking on you

47:23.520 --> 47:24.880
for being crabby.

47:24.880 --> 47:27.360
The problem is, if you had spun around on them and be like,

47:27.360 --> 47:31.200
excuse me, the crabby patty is a burger, not even a character,

47:31.200 --> 47:34.960
you would have like reinforced pretty hard, I think,

47:34.960 --> 47:38.160
the crabbyness part of the crabby patty.

47:38.160 --> 47:40.240
We should probably address the fact that this sounds

47:40.240 --> 47:42.880
like an incredibly toxic work environment.

47:42.880 --> 47:44.400
That is another thing.

47:44.400 --> 47:47.520
Yes, and that's not so much a funny joke

47:47.520 --> 47:51.120
as much as it is sort of a unfortunate reality.

47:53.120 --> 47:55.760
And not just because for the obvious,

47:55.760 --> 47:59.040
that's definitely hard, but it also sounds like on some level,

47:59.040 --> 48:03.920
these people are uncreative and unfunny and unfunny.

48:03.920 --> 48:05.360
Which SpongeBob character is everybody?

48:05.360 --> 48:08.320
You can't stop working at a place

48:08.320 --> 48:10.480
because the people in it are uncreative and unfunny.

48:10.480 --> 48:12.960
Like you will be job hopping for great money.

48:12.960 --> 48:15.040
You will be job hopping for quite a while.

48:15.040 --> 48:16.640
I don't know, now I'm self-employed

48:16.640 --> 48:18.800
and work with myself and I love it.

48:18.800 --> 48:21.440
I'm self-employed, I work by myself

48:21.440 --> 48:25.520
and the people I work with are funny about half the time.

48:25.520 --> 48:29.120
I do not think that that is a good metric.

48:29.120 --> 48:30.080
Wait, is that us?

48:30.080 --> 48:31.280
Hold on.

48:31.280 --> 48:34.000
No, me, the self-dunk.

48:34.000 --> 48:34.960
Oh, I get it.

48:34.960 --> 48:36.960
There's three of us, so if we're all funny half the time,

48:36.960 --> 48:39.760
the show's always funny, run the math.

48:39.760 --> 48:44.000
This is a, it's actually funny 150% of the time.

48:44.000 --> 48:45.280
I don't know.

48:45.280 --> 48:46.800
Now who's the Krabby Patty?

48:46.800 --> 48:47.600
Okay.

48:48.560 --> 48:49.760
This sucks, right?

48:49.760 --> 48:51.520
This is like a broader question about like,

48:51.520 --> 48:53.680
I work at a workplace where people are bullies,

48:53.680 --> 48:56.080
I think a little bit in this very innocuous,

48:56.080 --> 48:57.120
like passive aggressive way,

48:57.120 --> 48:58.800
but like, that's what it is, right?

48:58.800 --> 49:02.000
Like it's very rare that somebody is like pantsing people

49:02.000 --> 49:02.880
at the place they work.

49:02.880 --> 49:06.240
They just like set up these social hierarchies

49:06.240 --> 49:08.240
that not everyone gets the benefit of.

49:08.240 --> 49:11.120
That fucking sucks.

49:11.120 --> 49:12.400
This is like the office, right?

49:12.400 --> 49:16.640
Like if I worked in the office, the office, the office,

49:18.160 --> 49:21.440
and I saw Dwight getting all of his things taken

49:21.440 --> 49:23.760
and picked on and bullied all the time.

49:23.760 --> 49:24.800
Put in jello?

49:24.800 --> 49:25.760
Put in gelatin.

49:28.000 --> 49:28.800
Jim, can we not?

49:28.800 --> 49:30.400
Can we all stand up for Dwight for a second

49:30.400 --> 49:31.280
and ask Jim to not?

49:32.160 --> 49:35.440
Can you not put Dwight's stapler in some jammy shake,

49:35.440 --> 49:39.040
which is of course what the British called jello and gelatin.

49:39.040 --> 49:41.680
And of course I only watched the British version.

49:41.680 --> 49:43.600
I'll tell you the most frustrating thing

49:43.600 --> 49:46.880
about this poor question asker being called Krabby Patty

49:46.880 --> 49:48.400
is they sent a picture of themselves

49:48.400 --> 49:50.960
and they are a human sized starfish.

49:50.960 --> 49:54.400
And it seems to me like it's just right there.

49:54.400 --> 49:55.280
It's just right there.

49:55.280 --> 49:58.240
There was already somebody at work named Gatrick

49:58.240 --> 49:59.840
and you just can't.

50:00.640 --> 50:03.200
This is my friend, Gatrick Bypass.

50:03.200 --> 50:05.920
And would it be even worse if they were named Patrick

50:05.920 --> 50:08.640
and they were like, we're just gonna keep calling you Patrick

50:08.640 --> 50:10.000
and then they didn't get to play.

50:10.000 --> 50:11.760
They didn't get to play with me.

50:11.760 --> 50:15.360
Never play by the way people in a work environment

50:15.360 --> 50:18.720
or any environment really, the who would everyone be

50:18.720 --> 50:21.760
because inevitably in every media property

50:21.760 --> 50:26.160
there's always one jerk or asshole or disliked person

50:26.160 --> 50:27.680
and you're gonna come around to be like,

50:27.680 --> 50:29.200
and who would that person be?

50:29.200 --> 50:32.240
And it's always mean, always mean.

50:32.240 --> 50:33.840
If you do Game of Thrones in your office,

50:33.840 --> 50:34.720
you got enough people there,

50:34.720 --> 50:36.400
eventually you're gonna run out of the humans

50:36.400 --> 50:39.120
and somebody's gonna have to be a very mean dragon.

50:39.120 --> 50:40.320
Or the Uncomfortable Throne.

50:42.640 --> 50:44.560
I'm talking about how shitty that chair is.

50:44.560 --> 50:45.840
It's a shitty throne.

50:45.840 --> 50:49.520
You think it's just like, I'll kill everyone's family

50:49.520 --> 50:55.040
and make them do horrible crime

50:55.040 --> 50:58.720
and I'm gonna take over and get that big chair

50:58.720 --> 50:59.680
and the power that comes with it.

50:59.680 --> 51:01.360
And you sit in that chair after doing all that stuff

51:01.360 --> 51:05.760
and you're like, oh man, can I get like a sumo beanbag?

51:05.760 --> 51:06.560
Do you have those yet?

51:07.200 --> 51:09.280
And the other thing I've learned from,

51:09.280 --> 51:10.880
and this is just a side note of Game of Thrones,

51:10.880 --> 51:13.040
if someone tries to make you the Hand of the King,

51:13.040 --> 51:13.920
you're gonna die.

51:13.920 --> 51:15.360
So just say no, just don't do it.

51:15.360 --> 51:16.480
Just say no, don't do it.

51:16.480 --> 51:20.640
Listen, can you say, instead of Krabby Patty,

51:21.200 --> 51:24.720
can I be Goliath from Gargoyles?

51:24.720 --> 51:28.080
The T-shirt Gargoyles.

51:28.080 --> 51:29.440
And they'll say like, what?

51:29.440 --> 51:32.000
And you say like, yeah, either Goliath or Lexington,

51:32.000 --> 51:36.720
one of those two from Gargoyles, the TV show Gargoyles.

51:36.720 --> 51:37.760
I wanna be that one.

51:37.760 --> 51:39.840
And they say, but like, that's not really what we're doing.

51:39.840 --> 51:42.160
We're doing like a SpongeBob one.

51:42.160 --> 51:44.640
And then you, you know, roar.

51:44.640 --> 51:46.640
Maybe you show up the next day dressed up

51:46.640 --> 51:49.200
as cosplay from Gargoyles.

51:49.200 --> 51:52.800
And it's like, oh yes, it's me, Krabby Patty, I guess.

51:54.800 --> 51:57.600
Even though I'm clearly Lexington from the Gargoyles.

51:57.600 --> 51:58.560
Obviously Lexington.

51:58.560 --> 52:01.840
You know how I'm always perched on top of the cubicles?

52:01.840 --> 52:03.920
Yeah, perched on their cubicles and be like,

52:03.920 --> 52:06.080
I can be Bronx too if you want.

52:06.080 --> 52:08.720
How many other Gargoyles get Griffin name?

52:08.720 --> 52:10.000
Is that top of your head?

52:10.000 --> 52:10.720
Wait, hold on.

52:10.720 --> 52:12.080
Is that top of your head, Griffin?

52:12.640 --> 52:14.960
Yeah, I mean, they were all named after Burroughs and shit.

52:15.520 --> 52:17.920
My voice sounds exactly like Jonathan Frakes.

52:19.520 --> 52:21.840
Well, he wasn't actually a Gargoyle in that show.

52:21.840 --> 52:22.640
I don't remember.

52:23.600 --> 52:25.520
Somebody didn't watch the deleted scenes.

52:25.520 --> 52:27.760
Oh, he got bit by a Gargoyle turned into a Gargoyle.

52:27.760 --> 52:28.720
On the Blu-ray.

52:28.720 --> 52:30.000
Okay, I see.

52:30.000 --> 52:34.960
My memory of Gargoyles stopped when they were still back in the past.

52:34.960 --> 52:37.200
So you talking about them being in present day New York.

52:37.200 --> 52:38.240
I was like, wait, what the fuck?

52:39.680 --> 52:40.880
I forgot that.

52:40.880 --> 52:42.000
That's the pilot, bud.

52:42.000 --> 52:45.200
I know, but I forgot all about that.

52:45.200 --> 52:47.440
And I was like, why would they be named after the Burroughs

52:47.440 --> 52:50.480
in fucking old timey England or whatever?

52:50.480 --> 52:54.400
And only now do I remember looking at the Gargoyles TV series,

52:54.400 --> 52:57.760
Wikipedia, that it all took place in New York.

52:57.760 --> 52:59.120
Except for fucking Goliath.

52:59.120 --> 53:01.120
He was just like, I'm still Goliath.

53:01.120 --> 53:02.000
I'm still Goliath.

53:02.000 --> 53:03.840
Well, he's talking about Goliath Street,

53:03.840 --> 53:07.200
which is where all the big strong souvenir shops are.

53:07.200 --> 53:11.760
Okay, we need, let's end, let's finish the episode thusly.

53:11.760 --> 53:13.680
Thank you so much for listening to,

53:13.680 --> 53:16.320
where did, did Justin go pee in the fiction?

53:16.320 --> 53:16.960
We lost Justin.

53:16.960 --> 53:19.680
Oh, that's like, yeah, what is it in the fiction?

53:19.680 --> 53:24.800
Justin has, he's disapparated back to Hogwarts.

53:24.800 --> 53:26.160
Yes, he did a Hogwarts spell.

53:26.160 --> 53:27.120
No, he lost his thing.

53:27.120 --> 53:29.200
But Travis and I are jumping in here

53:29.200 --> 53:30.560
