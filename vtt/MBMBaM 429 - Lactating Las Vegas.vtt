00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:46.800
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me,

00:46.800 --> 00:51.200
an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

00:51.200 --> 00:56.880
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy. I'm your sweet baby brother, 30 Griffin McElroy.

00:56.880 --> 01:04.240
All right. A little self-edit there. Cut it out. Yeah, so it's time for another favorite part of

01:04.240 --> 01:12.080
the favorite show, everyone's beloved segment, Travis McElroy's Touched by the Hollywood Angels.

01:12.080 --> 01:18.640
Yeah. Touched by a Hollywood Angel. Travis, just let her rip. I'm just going to sit back

01:18.640 --> 01:23.520
and let it wash over me. I'm so excited, boys, because I went to the New York Comic Con. I had

01:23.520 --> 01:29.280
a lot of good times, met a lot of cool people. Most of them were my listeners. Did you meet

01:29.280 --> 01:36.800
the Doctor Who? Oh, no, Croggy. I did. I met Matt Smith. Step in my time box, Wibbly Bibbly.

01:36.800 --> 01:45.440
I met the Matt Smith. Time box, Wibbly Bibbly. I can't die, can I? I don't. Just come back

01:45.440 --> 01:55.520
somebody else, Wibbly Bibbly. Hey, do you guys think that random people just show up

01:55.520 --> 02:02.080
at a former companion's house and be like, it's me, the Doctor Who. Hey, get in my car.

02:02.640 --> 02:08.400
My tart has exploded. Get in my Datsun, quick. I'm in the back. I'm the Doctor now.

02:08.400 --> 02:14.160
Billy Piper has been kidnapped 18 times. Yeah. I don't have any British money. Can you take

02:14.160 --> 02:23.280
me out for a nice burger and chips? You know what I love? Fish fingers and custard. And then also

02:23.280 --> 02:28.960
like steak and vegetables and some scotch. And maybe some diamonds. I eat diamonds now.

02:28.960 --> 02:35.520
I eat diamonds from my two hearts. Oh, my time box said it needed $1,400, Wibbly.

02:35.520 --> 02:43.280
Listen, I owe $1,000 on my time box, but I'm going to sell it for a million.

02:43.280 --> 02:47.440
My time box just ran out of gas and I'm trying to get to me sisters.

02:47.440 --> 02:55.360
To pick up more money. So if you give me a thousand quid, then I will be back

02:55.360 --> 03:01.120
with 500,000 quid through time and space. I'm going to go back in time and invest in

03:01.120 --> 03:06.880
Apple, ain't I? But I need 1,000 quid from you. I got the sports betting

03:06.880 --> 03:13.280
almanac and all I need you to do, crikey. Travis, that was not the celebrity angel

03:13.280 --> 03:16.000
you were touched by. No, sorry.

03:16.000 --> 03:21.680
Day one, as I was walking into the building through the, and I'm not going to brag you,

03:21.680 --> 03:24.240
but talent entrance. Thank you.

03:24.240 --> 03:30.880
I walked side by side with one Mr. Mark the Ruffalo Buffalo Ruffalo.

03:30.880 --> 03:34.000
What's the smell? Describe it. Everything.

03:34.000 --> 03:38.960
Okay. What do you think he smells like? Old books? Oh, shit.

03:38.960 --> 03:42.400
And here's the thing. You know how sometimes you see someone and you're like,

03:42.400 --> 03:48.240
I think that's a celebrity. Who is that? Oh, is that the, I have never more quickly,

03:48.240 --> 03:51.920
like, like, yeah, that's Mark Ruffalo. Like there was no-

03:51.920 --> 03:54.080
Yeah, sure. He looks exactly like-

03:54.080 --> 03:56.320
Singular. And he is, in fact, Mark Ruffalo.

03:56.320 --> 03:59.200
Was he, was he a little kind of like all celebs or like-

03:59.200 --> 04:01.760
No. No, he was exactly-

04:01.760 --> 04:04.400
Picture what height you think Mark Ruffalo is. Yes.

04:04.400 --> 04:09.440
Do you think that could be part of the fact that, I love the Ruffalo Buffalo,

04:09.440 --> 04:17.680
you know this about me. He kind of is just doing him a lot of the time.

04:17.680 --> 04:18.560
A lot of the time.

04:18.560 --> 04:22.320
A lot of times he's not necessarily buried in the character.

04:22.320 --> 04:27.840
You're getting some permutation of, it's different sides of the same coin,

04:27.840 --> 04:30.480
but it is that original Ruffalo shaped coin.

04:30.480 --> 04:36.720
I just had the idea of a century. The Mask 2 or 3 starring Mark Ruffalo,

04:36.720 --> 04:43.360
who puts on the mask and becomes a sort of wild sort of physical comedy antics clown man.

04:43.360 --> 04:47.520
I actually think, Griffin, if Mark Ruffalo put on the mask, the mask would be like, you win.

04:48.720 --> 04:52.080
Oh, I see. Now I'm Mark Ruffalo.

04:52.080 --> 04:52.800
Sure.

04:52.800 --> 04:56.480
And here's the amazing thing is, I turned to him and I said,

04:56.480 --> 05:00.880
I'm a huge fan of the Avengers in the Marvel universe. And he said, thank you.

05:00.880 --> 05:05.200
And I said, I loved all the cliffhangers. I can't wait to find out what happens.

05:05.200 --> 05:06.800
And he said, well, what do you want to know?

05:07.600 --> 05:13.360
And I kind of jokingly said, everything. And he told me everything.

05:15.120 --> 05:16.320
He told you all the secrets?

05:17.040 --> 05:17.360
Yeah.

05:19.040 --> 05:23.360
And I don't know how much I'm allowed to tell you guys,

05:23.360 --> 05:24.400
how much you want to know.

05:24.400 --> 05:26.320
I'd love to know a little bit of it though.

05:26.320 --> 05:29.760
Okay. Well, of course, heavy spoilers for this point forward.

05:31.520 --> 05:33.440
These are all real and true, right?

05:33.440 --> 05:34.080
Yes, absolutely.

05:34.080 --> 05:34.960
Not goofs.

05:34.960 --> 05:36.080
No, absolutely 1000%.

05:37.600 --> 05:45.120
A big majority of the next movie takes place in Stanley's coma.

05:46.800 --> 05:50.000
Where Stanley is like a character in it.

05:50.560 --> 05:53.360
Oh, this isn't ripped. This is not ripped from the headlines though, right, bud?

05:53.920 --> 05:54.640
No.

05:54.640 --> 05:55.920
Is he in a coma?

05:55.920 --> 05:57.920
I don't know, bud, but you said it so confidently.

05:57.920 --> 06:05.280
No, no, no. He is a character in it as he's talking with Captain America and the Hulk and stuff.

06:06.400 --> 06:08.480
Just remember that this podcast is a mummy's tomb,

06:08.480 --> 06:11.120
just full of curses for every celebrity we name.

06:11.120 --> 06:12.720
So Mark Ruffalo also should be on it.

06:12.720 --> 06:16.880
There's a lot of stuff in which Thor is looking at Stanley saying,

06:16.880 --> 06:20.400
why did you create his father? And there's a lot of that stuff.

06:20.400 --> 06:21.120
Sure, sure, sure.

06:21.120 --> 06:31.120
Sure. Spider-Man becomes a spider, a tiny spider, and he does save a piglet's life.

06:32.240 --> 06:32.960
Interesting.

06:32.960 --> 06:34.400
That's what Mark Ruffalo told me about.

06:36.160 --> 06:38.080
Yeah, is there anything you guys want to know?

06:38.080 --> 06:41.920
Well, I want to know if you felt sort of guilty immediately after this interaction

06:41.920 --> 06:45.360
that you approached him and said you were a fan of the Marvel universe,

06:45.360 --> 06:49.040
because I bet you Mark Ruffalo is just always waiting for somebody to come up to him

06:49.040 --> 06:51.360
and ask him about the Foxcatcher-averse.

06:51.360 --> 06:51.760
Yeah.

06:51.760 --> 06:54.000
Just sort of the extended Foxcatcher canon.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.640
I mean, I led with the spotlight-averse.

06:56.640 --> 07:00.160
Yeah, I said, are the kids all right? And he said, the kids are all right.

07:00.160 --> 07:00.720
They're fine.

07:00.720 --> 07:01.520
And I said, oh, cool, cool.

07:03.760 --> 07:08.800
And I said, I love how the spotlight of the mind goes on eternally.

07:10.080 --> 07:12.880
Yeah, yeah, yeah. And he got that. He thought that was very funny.

07:12.880 --> 07:13.840
Was he in that one?

07:13.840 --> 07:15.600
Yeah, and then I said-

07:15.600 --> 07:16.480
He was in that one. He was one of the science guys, right?

07:16.480 --> 07:19.440
He was in that one. He was one of the science guys.

07:19.440 --> 07:24.000
And then I said, so what's up with Spider-Man and Purpleface guy?

07:24.000 --> 07:25.920
Mark Ruff, the science buff.

07:27.760 --> 07:30.000
Mark Ruff, the science buff.

07:30.000 --> 07:30.800
Okay.

07:30.800 --> 07:31.840
Did you ask him how he-

07:31.840 --> 07:33.440
He played- I don't know if you guys remember this.

07:33.440 --> 07:35.200
He played Beakman in Beacon's World.

07:35.200 --> 07:35.760
Interesting.

07:35.760 --> 07:37.120
Yeah, that was Paul's Allume.

07:37.760 --> 07:38.160
Jesus Christ.

07:38.160 --> 07:39.520
Well, it was Tomato Tomato.

07:39.520 --> 07:42.800
Did you ask him how pre-production was going on 14, going on 31?

07:42.800 --> 07:43.040
Yeah.

07:43.920 --> 07:45.120
He said it's going well.

07:45.120 --> 07:45.920
Okay.

07:47.920 --> 07:52.560
He has to go through a lot of prosthetics to look that young again.

07:52.560 --> 07:53.040
Sure, sure.

07:53.040 --> 07:54.400
And by which I mean 14.

07:54.400 --> 07:55.840
14 years old, yeah.

07:55.840 --> 07:58.080
This one is actually 30 going on 13.

07:58.720 --> 07:59.440
Whoa.

07:59.440 --> 08:04.160
Yeah, where he plays the 30, but he didn't want a child actor to play him

08:04.160 --> 08:05.520
because he thought that would be weird.

08:05.520 --> 08:09.200
And he was looking for a chance to be transformative like we talked about earlier.

08:09.200 --> 08:12.160
So he is playing the 13-year-old too.

08:12.160 --> 08:15.120
Sure, and he's like, I'm going to go invest in some Apple stocks.

08:15.120 --> 08:16.560
Yeah, yeah.

08:16.560 --> 08:18.560
Should we do advice now that we're done talking about-

08:18.560 --> 08:20.320
You don't want to know any more about Mark Ruffalo

08:20.320 --> 08:22.400
and what he told me about the Marvel Cinematic Universe

08:22.400 --> 08:23.760
and the direction they're taking it?

08:23.760 --> 08:26.080
It's going to be lies from your own mind.

08:26.080 --> 08:27.520
They're going to do Avengers Babies.

08:28.400 --> 08:28.720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:28.720 --> 08:30.240
That's for sure happening.

08:30.240 --> 08:32.160
Avengers Babies is locked in.

08:32.160 --> 08:36.560
But also Avengers Oldies, where it's all of them in a retirement home together.

08:37.120 --> 08:37.920
Okay.

08:37.920 --> 08:38.480
Yeah.

08:38.480 --> 08:39.360
I don't hate it.

08:39.360 --> 08:44.080
Avengers Teens, and they're going like a Riverdale kind of thing.

08:44.800 --> 08:47.920
Yeah, and then Adults Avengers.

08:47.920 --> 08:51.120
Avengers Vampires, they're doing that one.

08:51.120 --> 08:54.400
Yo, have they ever avenged even anything?

08:54.400 --> 08:55.920
It's just like aliens are coming.

08:55.920 --> 08:56.640
Let's get them.

08:56.640 --> 09:00.560
You're not Avengers, you're sort of Defenders.

09:00.560 --> 09:01.200
You know what I mean?

09:01.200 --> 09:02.400
That would be a way better name for the movie.

09:02.400 --> 09:03.440
They're going to change the name.

09:03.440 --> 09:03.920
To Defenders.

09:03.920 --> 09:07.280
He did say they're changing it to Defenders.

09:07.280 --> 09:11.280
And they're going to do that retroactively and re-release all the movies.

09:11.280 --> 09:14.640
For $40, you can watch Defenders.

09:14.640 --> 09:15.760
You can get Defenders,

09:15.760 --> 09:18.560
but also it's going to be packaged with the Lord of the Rings movies

09:18.560 --> 09:22.000
because they're tying that into the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.880
Defenders has the incredible Mulk and Guy.

09:26.880 --> 09:29.040
Now, why would they change their names, Griffin?

09:30.240 --> 09:31.040
I don't know, man.

09:31.040 --> 09:32.320
I just really want to do advice.

09:32.320 --> 09:33.920
I've been like excited to do advice all week.

09:33.920 --> 09:35.360
I didn't think we'd get it a lot.

09:35.360 --> 09:38.560
I've been excited to talk about Paul Zaloom and that went nowhere.

09:38.560 --> 09:41.280
That was a real lead balloon on a real red Zaloom.

09:43.280 --> 09:46.880
By the way, that show is huge in Latin America.

09:46.880 --> 09:49.920
And you can see pictures of…

09:49.920 --> 09:53.520
He's still like down there grinding it out in the wig and everything.

09:53.520 --> 09:54.160
All right.

09:54.160 --> 09:55.200
Because he's huge down there.

09:55.200 --> 09:55.840
You got to see…

09:56.400 --> 09:57.280
Folks, get online.

09:57.280 --> 10:00.480
See pictures of Paul Zaloom doing the Beakman thing still

10:00.480 --> 10:03.040
and watching kids in Latin America like flip their shit.

10:03.040 --> 10:04.400
It's just so inspiring.

10:04.400 --> 10:05.440
Like so ripped.

10:05.440 --> 10:06.240
So ripped.

10:06.240 --> 10:10.240
Also, if you got a MeTV affiliate, Sunday's at 8am.

10:10.240 --> 10:12.320
They're fucking cranking Beakman's world again.

10:12.320 --> 10:14.320
If you want to see Beakman, he's back.

10:14.320 --> 10:15.360
He's on at 8am.

10:16.640 --> 10:18.960
Anyway, let's help people.

10:20.720 --> 10:22.480
This first question says,

10:22.480 --> 10:27.520
Justin, I want a great book as a gift for the special doctor

10:27.520 --> 10:28.800
or really anybody in my life.

10:30.320 --> 10:31.360
Do you have any suggestions?

10:31.360 --> 10:32.400
Well, it's funny.

10:32.400 --> 10:34.240
The Sawbones book is out.

10:34.240 --> 10:37.920
This came out last week and folks, it's flying off the shelves.

10:37.920 --> 10:38.880
You can find a copy.

10:38.880 --> 10:40.320
You got to pick this thing up.

10:40.320 --> 10:42.640
Bit.ly forward slash the Sawbones book.

10:42.640 --> 10:44.080
And here's our next…

10:44.080 --> 10:45.120
Well, that's so funny, Justin.

10:45.120 --> 10:46.400
The next question says,

10:46.400 --> 10:49.040
I'm not in the mood for a book right now,

10:49.040 --> 10:52.640
but in six months, I think I would like to read a graphic novel.

10:53.360 --> 10:54.800
Oh, well, good news.

10:54.800 --> 10:56.480
Theadventurezonecomic.com.

10:57.120 --> 10:58.560
You can pre-order a book too.

10:58.560 --> 11:00.960
We're never going to make it six months, folks.

11:00.960 --> 11:03.440

11:04.320 --> 11:06.560
Get a book for now and a book for later.

11:07.440 --> 11:09.120
Well, this is the third question.

11:09.120 --> 11:11.440
It says that in 18 months,

11:11.440 --> 11:15.280
I'm in the mood to read a Griffin McElroy's parody book

11:15.280 --> 11:18.720
of 700 Sundays called 701 Fun Days.

11:18.720 --> 11:19.840
Well, good news.

11:19.840 --> 11:23.040
Pre-order it now at books.dog.

11:23.040 --> 11:31.840
Hey, I want a book that's going to pick up my spirits

11:31.840 --> 11:34.000
and lift my mood, folks.

11:34.000 --> 11:39.280
There's one you can get right now by Jomni Sun

11:39.280 --> 11:41.120
and Lin-Manuel Miranda,

11:42.080 --> 11:44.880

11:44.880 --> 11:47.440
Little Pep Talks from Me to You.

11:47.440 --> 11:50.560
Shouldn't you go pick up this number one bestseller

11:50.560 --> 11:53.120
in the self-esteem category?

11:53.680 --> 11:54.400
I think you should.

11:54.400 --> 11:57.680
That's going to be out October 16th as the crow flies.

11:57.680 --> 11:58.880
Make sure you get your copy.

11:58.880 --> 12:00.320
I know I did.

12:00.320 --> 12:02.080
Put a little pep in my step for sure.

12:02.080 --> 12:02.640
Absolutely.

12:02.640 --> 12:04.960
How, just side note, how much,

12:04.960 --> 12:07.360
what's our cut of every sale of that?

12:07.360 --> 12:07.760
100%.

12:08.640 --> 12:08.880
Whoa.

12:09.520 --> 12:10.000
Yeah.

12:10.000 --> 12:10.960
That's a good deal.

12:10.960 --> 12:13.360
I mean, for us, it's a terrible deal for them.

12:13.360 --> 12:13.840
For sure.

12:13.840 --> 12:16.000
What's the first real question from like

12:16.000 --> 12:18.320
the God's Honest Truth real question on this list?

12:18.320 --> 12:22.320
My university students, damn.

12:22.320 --> 12:23.840
Try again, bud.

12:23.840 --> 12:26.400
Oh no, we didn't even make it four words.

12:26.400 --> 12:27.680
Three words in, Daniel, damn.

12:27.680 --> 12:29.360
You've done it again, Daniel.

12:29.360 --> 12:32.080
Damn, back at it again with the white fans.

12:32.080 --> 12:33.760
Hey, how come that kid was allowed to cuss

12:33.760 --> 12:34.880
that much at school?

12:34.880 --> 12:36.000
Yeah, I know, right?

12:36.000 --> 12:38.960
He was like yelling curse words a lot at school.

12:38.960 --> 12:40.800
If Vine was seven seconds,

12:40.800 --> 12:42.480
you would have seen the principal be like,

12:42.480 --> 12:45.760
uh, excuse me, Philip, excuse me.

12:45.760 --> 12:46.800
Detention.

12:46.800 --> 12:49.360
Detention, back at it again with the attention.

12:49.360 --> 12:51.040
Summer school.

12:51.040 --> 12:52.960
Dag, daggum it, Daniel.

12:54.560 --> 12:56.720
Gosh darn it, H-E double hockey sticks, Daniel.

12:56.720 --> 12:58.480
H-E double hockey sticks, Daniel,

12:58.480 --> 12:59.920
back at it again with the white van.

12:59.920 --> 13:01.360
Ah, piss, Daniel.

13:03.120 --> 13:05.120
I think that still counts as-

13:05.120 --> 13:06.080
What's the first question?

13:06.080 --> 13:06.800
I'm dying, I'm in hell.

13:06.800 --> 13:08.720
My university requires students

13:08.720 --> 13:11.040
to pick up packages at the bookstore,

13:11.040 --> 13:14.320
and thanks to my kind friends and family,

13:14.320 --> 13:17.200
I find myself at the bookstore once or twice a week.

13:17.200 --> 13:18.640
You know why you're there?

13:18.640 --> 13:20.720
Shit, there was like a whole fucking thing

13:20.720 --> 13:22.480
built into this one, fuck.

13:23.440 --> 13:26.240
Recently, the woman who is always,

13:26.240 --> 13:27.440
and this is all caps here,

13:27.440 --> 13:29.200
running the bookstore told me,

13:29.200 --> 13:30.880
you're in here every day.

13:31.600 --> 13:32.960
I assumed she was exaggerating

13:32.960 --> 13:34.160
to make me self-conscious.

13:34.160 --> 13:34.880
It worked.

13:34.880 --> 13:36.000
Until a couple of days ago,

13:36.000 --> 13:38.160
when she told me matter of factly,

13:38.160 --> 13:40.240
this is your second time coming in here today.

13:40.880 --> 13:41.520
Uh-oh.

13:41.520 --> 13:42.160
It was not.

13:42.160 --> 13:44.800
Is the package lady confusing me for another student,

13:44.800 --> 13:46.480
or is she stuck in a time loop?

13:46.480 --> 13:48.080
How do I face her next time?

13:48.080 --> 13:51.120
That's from Frazzled in Fredonia, New York.

13:51.920 --> 13:55.600
I really enjoy that the question asker's assumption here

13:55.600 --> 13:58.320
is that this woman working at the bookstore

13:58.320 --> 13:59.920
was, of course, doing this

13:59.920 --> 14:01.680
just to make them self-conscious.

14:02.560 --> 14:04.880
Yeah, and now it's making them think

14:04.880 --> 14:07.200
that they do have a twin, or,

14:07.200 --> 14:08.080
because that can be like,

14:08.080 --> 14:09.120
you work at a bookstore,

14:09.120 --> 14:10.880
really any sort of retail gig,

14:10.880 --> 14:12.240
you gotta make the fun.

14:12.240 --> 14:13.040
You know what I mean?

14:13.840 --> 14:15.680
And so maybe that means

14:15.680 --> 14:19.680
you bring some Sudoku books in with you,

14:19.680 --> 14:22.160
and sometimes it means trying to convince people

14:22.160 --> 14:23.920
that they do in fact have twins,

14:23.920 --> 14:26.080
or maybe that you try to convince people

14:26.080 --> 14:28.240
that they have been John Malkoviched,

14:28.240 --> 14:30.080
which it sounds like maybe that is what they're trying,

14:30.080 --> 14:32.160
the game they're trying to pull right now.

14:32.160 --> 14:32.660
Uh-huh.

14:33.360 --> 14:34.400
And maybe it's not a lie.

14:34.400 --> 14:35.440
It might not be a lie,

14:35.440 --> 14:36.240
it may not be a game.

14:36.240 --> 14:38.000
You may have been John Malkoviched.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.040
Ugh.

14:39.040 --> 14:40.800
That's, it's so important.

14:40.800 --> 14:43.360
Okay, listen, when you sit down to read a book,

14:43.360 --> 14:45.440
or lay down to go to bed, or something,

14:45.440 --> 14:47.040
take one hair off your head,

14:47.040 --> 14:47.760
lick both ends,

14:47.760 --> 14:50.800
stick it across the doorframe and the door.

14:50.800 --> 14:53.680
And that way, if it's gone when you wake back up,

14:53.680 --> 14:55.120
you know you've been John Malkoviched.

14:55.120 --> 14:55.680
You've been John Malkoviched.

14:55.680 --> 14:58.080
So go ahead and balance it on the bridge of your nose.

14:58.080 --> 14:58.580
Yeah.

14:58.580 --> 15:01.920
And if it moves, you have the John Malkoviched door.

15:01.920 --> 15:03.840
I've not seen the film,

15:03.840 --> 15:05.600
but the John, they get in there, I guess.

15:05.600 --> 15:07.760
You haven't seen the film?

15:07.760 --> 15:14.080
Uh, no, it seems a little too, I don't know, adult.

15:15.120 --> 15:16.880
Is there a point in the John Malkoviched

15:16.880 --> 15:18.080
being John Malkoviched film,

15:18.080 --> 15:21.040
where John Malkoviched goes in his own John Malkoviched door?

15:21.040 --> 15:23.280
I think famously, famously, yes.

15:23.280 --> 15:24.960
I think that does, in fact, happen.

15:24.960 --> 15:27.120
You guys know that, you guys ever been on SNL

15:27.120 --> 15:29.760
where John Malkoviched read Twas the Night Before Christmas?

15:29.760 --> 15:30.240
Yes.

15:30.240 --> 15:32.480
And y'all had all kinds of spooky sides.

15:32.480 --> 15:34.400
If I was gonna be John Malkoviched,

15:34.400 --> 15:35.680
and I ducked in, and I was like,

15:35.680 --> 15:40.000
hey, hi, this is John Malkoviched.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.200
Is this my manager?

15:41.200 --> 15:43.040
Good, that's why you saved it on my cell phone.

15:43.040 --> 15:46.240
Hey, listen, I'm a little fuzzy on timeline.

15:46.240 --> 15:48.080
Have I already done that great bit on SNL?

15:48.640 --> 15:50.240
Okay, well, I'm gonna leave then.

15:50.240 --> 15:51.440
I just wanted to duck in for that.

15:52.720 --> 15:54.560
And you just wanted to make sure that it happened?

15:54.560 --> 15:56.880
No, I wanted to experience that.

15:56.880 --> 15:59.840
So like, I would hang out in John Malkoviched for,

16:01.200 --> 16:04.560
I don't know, I would say at least five days,

16:04.560 --> 16:07.680
to be able to do that bit on SNL.

16:08.240 --> 16:08.880
Sure.

16:08.880 --> 16:10.080
Do you ever think about the fact

16:10.080 --> 16:12.320
that they just completely missed the opportunity

16:12.320 --> 16:14.160
to make a series of movies that were like,

16:14.160 --> 16:17.520
being John Malkoviched, being Samuel L. Jackson.

16:17.520 --> 16:18.400
Sure, sure, sure.

16:18.400 --> 16:20.960
Being Maya Rudolph, I would say.

16:20.960 --> 16:23.920
That's what he is always on the lookout for, is a franchise.

16:23.920 --> 16:26.080
Spike Jonze loves a franchise.

16:28.960 --> 16:30.320
There are so many conversations happening

16:30.320 --> 16:33.600
about how Get Out is unofficially a part of the,

16:33.600 --> 16:34.640
being John Malkovich-versed,

16:34.640 --> 16:36.240
but that's neither here nor there.

16:36.240 --> 16:38.720
What is going on here in this exact situation

16:38.720 --> 16:40.080
in Fredonia, New York?

16:43.840 --> 16:48.240
I think this person is probably confused.

16:48.240 --> 16:50.560
I mean, that would be my best bet

16:50.560 --> 16:54.320
that they've just made some sort of non-funny error.

16:57.840 --> 17:00.640
Yeah, can you have them take a picture of you

17:00.640 --> 17:03.280
every time you, quote unquote, you come in?

17:03.280 --> 17:04.800
So then you can at least know

17:04.800 --> 17:11.600
if you do have a doppelganger or a twin separated at birth.

17:11.600 --> 17:12.560
It can happen, folks.

17:12.560 --> 17:13.360
It has happened.

17:13.360 --> 17:14.400
It does happen all the time.

17:14.400 --> 17:14.880
It does happen.

17:14.880 --> 17:17.280
I've seen it probably on like ABC Family.

17:17.840 --> 17:19.680
I think it's on there probably.

17:19.680 --> 17:22.400
Every third set of twins get separated at birth.

17:22.400 --> 17:24.640
Here's a good, okay, I got a good test.

17:25.680 --> 17:26.560
I got a good test.

17:27.120 --> 17:29.680
Tell this person the next time that they see,

17:29.680 --> 17:33.040
every time they see you in the store for the next week,

17:33.040 --> 17:35.200
to force feed you a bunch of peanuts.

17:35.760 --> 17:36.800
Oh, all right.

17:36.800 --> 17:38.320
Okay, but think about this.

17:38.320 --> 17:44.560
If that person balloons up or has an anaphylactic response,

17:45.200 --> 17:46.320
then that's your twin.

17:47.040 --> 17:49.920
Because that stuff is like, that's genetic.

17:49.920 --> 17:51.040
Wait, but hold on, Justin.

17:51.040 --> 17:54.560
Nowhere in this question does the question asker say

17:54.560 --> 17:56.160
that they are allergic to peanuts.

17:56.160 --> 17:59.840
Yeah, but if they're not allergic, it won't work.

17:59.840 --> 18:00.640
Yeah.

18:00.640 --> 18:01.120
Okay.

18:01.120 --> 18:02.400
Did you even fucking think of that

18:02.400 --> 18:03.440
before you opened your big mouth?

18:03.440 --> 18:04.080
You know what?

18:04.080 --> 18:05.760
Look, I'm the asshole here, I guess.

18:07.600 --> 18:10.000
Say the next time, tell the person the next time

18:10.720 --> 18:12.960
that you, quote unquote, you come in,

18:12.960 --> 18:17.680
have them hold her or them in like bookstore jail.

18:19.280 --> 18:19.780
Yeah.

18:20.480 --> 18:21.600
Arrest them, you're saying.

18:21.600 --> 18:23.840
And arrest them in the prison section.

18:23.840 --> 18:24.800
I see, I see, I see.

18:24.800 --> 18:29.040
Yeah, so have the bookstore worker person hold your twin

18:29.040 --> 18:30.880
until you can get there and investigate.

18:31.520 --> 18:33.760
Listen, for me, that might as well be the cookbook section

18:33.760 --> 18:35.440
because good luck getting me out of there

18:35.440 --> 18:37.440
once I find my way in.

18:39.920 --> 18:40.240
I mean, it's also-

18:40.240 --> 18:41.280
Can you check their fingerprints?

18:41.280 --> 18:44.720
Have the librarian of the bookstore check their fingerprints

18:44.720 --> 18:46.400
to see if it's a match for theirs.

18:46.400 --> 18:48.640
You know they got that ink for when they do the stamps

18:48.640 --> 18:50.640
in the book, do people still do that?

18:50.640 --> 18:51.280
Probably not because-

18:51.280 --> 18:51.440
At bookstores or-

18:51.440 --> 18:53.440
Probably not at a bookstore, Griffin.

18:53.440 --> 18:54.240
No.

18:54.240 --> 18:56.080
Bring this back in two weeks.

18:56.080 --> 18:56.640
Wait, what?

18:58.000 --> 18:59.520
Yeah, you're not allowed to keep this.

18:59.520 --> 19:02.000
It also could be, you know, a hurricane heist

19:02.000 --> 19:04.480
where they know that you're getting your packages delivered

19:04.480 --> 19:06.000
there every other day.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.600
And so they know you're a rich target.

19:07.600 --> 19:10.640
They have Mission Impossible 3D printed on a mask of your face

19:10.640 --> 19:13.200
and they will go in and they'll get all the packages.

19:13.200 --> 19:15.120
That's another, there's so many reasons

19:15.120 --> 19:17.360
why you need to install a series of webcams

19:17.360 --> 19:19.360
all around this bookstore or library.

19:19.360 --> 19:20.960
No one's quite sure what it is.

19:20.960 --> 19:22.480
There are rumors it could be either one.

19:22.480 --> 19:23.760
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

19:23.760 --> 19:24.800
I'd love one, thank you.

19:24.800 --> 19:27.360
I got this one sent in by lots of people.

19:27.360 --> 19:30.480
It's Yahoo Answers user, Billy, who asks,

19:31.200 --> 19:35.760
do you think Neil Armstrong filled his space diaper

19:35.760 --> 19:36.880
during the moonwalk?

19:36.880 --> 19:38.400
Serious answers, please.

19:38.400 --> 19:41.520
I'm working on my dissertation related to the moon.

19:42.720 --> 19:44.240
Let that first sentence sink in.

19:44.240 --> 19:45.280
All right, one more time.

19:46.000 --> 19:49.200
I'm working on my dissertation related to the moon.

19:49.200 --> 19:51.680
We now know that the moon's weak gravity

19:51.680 --> 19:55.840
loosens astronauts' bowels.

19:55.840 --> 19:57.680
Did early astronauts know this

19:57.680 --> 19:59.280
or did they find out the hard way?

20:00.640 --> 20:02.960
I'm, okay, listen.

20:04.320 --> 20:06.480
This is a peer-reviewed knowledge source

20:06.480 --> 20:08.000
that you can find on Nexus Lexus.

20:08.000 --> 20:08.880
Is this Yahoo Answer?

20:08.880 --> 20:10.480
I need it for my dissertation.

20:10.480 --> 20:12.400
So there are many things that I am not.

20:12.960 --> 20:16.880
One of them is a gastrointestinal, yeah, a tummy doctor.

20:16.880 --> 20:17.840
One of them.

20:17.840 --> 20:20.720
And two, scientists, like in any way, really.

20:20.720 --> 20:22.720
Science, I think, covers that as well.

20:22.720 --> 20:23.360
Sure.

20:23.360 --> 20:26.960
But my, no pun intended, gut reaction

20:27.600 --> 20:29.280
is that this is not true.

20:30.400 --> 20:32.480
About space loosening the bowel?

20:32.480 --> 20:33.120
Yes.

20:33.120 --> 20:33.600
Okay.

20:33.600 --> 20:36.720
Because I have been on like roller coasters

20:36.720 --> 20:39.920
and rides and stuff that spun me around in such a way

20:39.920 --> 20:41.520
that I imagine in a less fun way

20:41.520 --> 20:43.920
they do when they're training you to be an astronaut.

20:43.920 --> 20:46.000
And it has never made me shit myself.

20:46.000 --> 20:46.960
This is amazing.

20:46.960 --> 20:47.460
Okay.

20:48.160 --> 20:48.800
What's wrong?

20:48.800 --> 20:52.640
Are you telling me, Travis, that the fact

20:52.640 --> 20:55.040
that you have been on a roller coaster

20:55.760 --> 20:59.440
uniquely positions you to comment on the effects

20:59.440 --> 21:01.200
of space travel on the human body?

21:01.200 --> 21:04.000
Is this what you just said, not as a joke,

21:04.000 --> 21:04.960
but as a real thing?

21:05.600 --> 21:08.000
Well, more than that, Justin, I started originally

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
before I thought of the roller coaster thing

21:10.000 --> 21:12.080
with no evidence to back it up.

21:12.080 --> 21:13.680
And then the roller coaster thing occurred to me

21:13.680 --> 21:16.080
and I was like, wait, hold on, I'm onto something here.

21:16.080 --> 21:18.560
And now I do, yes, I do feel very strongly

21:18.560 --> 21:20.320
about the fact that I've been on a tilt swirl

21:20.320 --> 21:22.080
and I have not shit my pants.

21:22.080 --> 21:26.800
And so I think that probably Neil Armstrong

21:26.800 --> 21:28.240
was probably fine.

21:28.240 --> 21:28.560
All right.

21:28.560 --> 21:30.240
I did it just to cursory Google

21:30.240 --> 21:31.360
and we will get back to the question

21:31.360 --> 21:32.480
because it merits discussion.

21:32.480 --> 21:33.360
It's a hot subject.

21:33.360 --> 21:35.120
This is our first man watch.

21:35.120 --> 21:38.800
But I did find that low gravity, being in low gravity

21:38.800 --> 21:40.640
makes it difficult to tell if your bladder is full

21:40.640 --> 21:42.080
because the bladder's stretch receptor

21:42.080 --> 21:43.760
nerves don't feel the weight of the liquid.

21:43.760 --> 21:45.600
Astronauts are trained to empty their bladders

21:45.600 --> 21:47.520
every two hours because of this.

21:47.520 --> 21:50.480
So these are the world's most elite scientists,

21:50.480 --> 21:52.560
the world's most bravest explorers,

21:52.560 --> 21:56.000
space pioneers risking their lives

21:56.000 --> 21:59.760
and just everything to go up into the dangerous,

21:59.760 --> 22:01.280
endless expanse of outer space

22:01.280 --> 22:03.280
to further our scientific pursuits.

22:03.280 --> 22:04.640
They are geniuses.

22:04.640 --> 22:06.080
They are brave.

22:06.080 --> 22:07.600
They are the best of us.

22:07.600 --> 22:09.840
And also they have a little special watch they wear

22:09.840 --> 22:12.560
to let them know it's tinkle time every 120 minutes.

22:12.560 --> 22:14.640
Because when they have to go potty,

22:14.640 --> 22:16.400
they stop and go right away.

22:16.400 --> 22:17.840
Yeah, exactly.

22:17.840 --> 22:20.320
Houston, I've learned the cells have separated up here

22:20.320 --> 22:23.360
in zero gravity, furthering the research

22:23.360 --> 22:25.200
into curing cancer.

22:25.200 --> 22:26.320
I think we've finally got it.

22:26.320 --> 22:27.120
Oh, beep, beep, beep.

22:27.120 --> 22:29.920
Time for me to go pee pee in the space potty.

22:30.880 --> 22:34.800
I need to go tinkle, tinkle and make yellow, Houston.

22:34.800 --> 22:36.080
So give me a bit.

22:36.080 --> 22:37.120
It's yellow time.

22:37.120 --> 22:40.880
Now, Griffey, to be fair, not knowing if you have to go

22:40.880 --> 22:45.200
to the potty versus like automatically uncontrollable

22:45.200 --> 22:48.160
going to the potty is two different things.

22:48.160 --> 22:51.680
Is it possible that this is not actually having an effect

22:51.680 --> 22:53.200
and they're just bored?

22:53.200 --> 22:57.040
It's like, I would imagine trying to use a space toilet

22:57.040 --> 22:59.440
is the highlight of space travel.

22:59.440 --> 23:02.160
When you're just floating up there in the dark, who cares?

23:03.200 --> 23:05.760
You're looking forward to that next time that you,

23:05.760 --> 23:07.280
like you're just twiddling your thumbs,

23:07.280 --> 23:09.360
hoping that you're gonna have to take a dookie

23:09.360 --> 23:10.240
any moment now.

23:10.240 --> 23:12.800
Yeah, that's the thing, Justin.

23:12.800 --> 23:13.760
We are talking about this,

23:13.760 --> 23:15.520
and I think the question asked who was talking about this

23:15.520 --> 23:17.840
in such way of like, do you think Neil Armstrong

23:17.840 --> 23:20.560
might've like lost control of his belt?

23:20.560 --> 23:22.480
But I think the opposite is true.

23:22.480 --> 23:24.560
We're probably like after five minutes

23:24.560 --> 23:27.280
of being on the moon, Neil Armstrong was like,

23:27.280 --> 23:29.520
I'm gonna be the first man to shit on the moon.

23:29.520 --> 23:33.040
Yeah, he definitely did that or cranked,

23:33.040 --> 23:34.720
but there's something that happened up there.

23:35.280 --> 23:36.240
Have you ever listened?

23:36.240 --> 23:38.800
Pulled his arm inside the sleeve of his space suit.

23:38.800 --> 23:40.240
He could, and he didn't know.

23:40.240 --> 23:41.200
Plant the flag, Neil.

23:41.200 --> 23:44.240
He's like, oh, I'm doing that in a manner of speaking.

23:44.240 --> 23:45.200
You ever listened to,

23:45.200 --> 23:47.360
yeah, y'all ever listened to that tape

23:48.080 --> 23:49.440
where he's talking about how he did it?

23:50.080 --> 23:51.440
Talking about how he cranked it?

23:51.440 --> 23:54.080
No, he's talking about how he's taking one big step for guys.

23:54.080 --> 23:55.360
One big step for guys.

23:55.360 --> 23:58.640
He says one big, he says one huge leap for boys,

23:58.640 --> 23:59.600
and he does it.

23:59.600 --> 24:00.480
Have you listened to it?

24:02.880 --> 24:04.880
Hey, everybody check out my moon cave.

24:04.880 --> 24:06.560
I mean, man cave.

24:06.560 --> 24:09.920
This is me and my other dudes hanging out here in space.

24:09.920 --> 24:11.600
He did declare when he planted the flag,

24:11.600 --> 24:12.880
the moon is for boys.

24:12.880 --> 24:15.200
I remember him saying that really loudly.

24:16.160 --> 24:17.920
But do you ever listen to it?

24:17.920 --> 24:23.520
Welcome to the big radical white rock just for boys only.

24:24.080 --> 24:26.160
He said, Neil, you have to come back now.

24:26.160 --> 24:28.560
And he said, I'm playing on the moon, leave me alone.

24:28.560 --> 24:29.760
You can't boss me around.

24:29.760 --> 24:31.200
I'm a boy and I'm on the moon.

24:33.200 --> 24:34.480
And the first time an eclipse happened,

24:34.480 --> 24:35.920
he went around apologizing to everybody.

24:35.920 --> 24:38.320
Sorry guys, my boy rock got in the way of the sun.

24:38.320 --> 24:40.240
I apologize, it shouldn't happen.

24:41.200 --> 24:42.640
So have you listened to the tape?

24:43.680 --> 24:46.160
I mean, I've seen it in like alien movies.

24:47.280 --> 24:49.840
Dad described it to me.

24:49.840 --> 24:50.960
Well, if you listen to it,

24:50.960 --> 24:53.280
it's on Library of Congress website,

24:53.280 --> 24:54.480
which I'm on all the time.

24:55.280 --> 24:58.560
He sounds sheepish a little bit.

24:58.560 --> 25:00.720
He sounds a little bit,

25:00.720 --> 25:02.880
and for lack of a better term, just kind of naughty,

25:02.880 --> 25:03.840
like while he's doing it.

25:05.680 --> 25:07.120
And he wouldn't say it, right?

25:07.120 --> 25:09.360
Like that was being broadcast to the whole world.

25:09.360 --> 25:12.800
The world's eyes were watching the stars, the cosmos,

25:12.800 --> 25:14.800
as we took our first, you know,

25:16.160 --> 25:20.640
intrepid steps into our destiny in the galaxies beyond.

25:20.640 --> 25:23.840
He did have poop on his butt when he said it, probably.

25:23.840 --> 25:25.920
If you listen to the tape, if you really listen to it,

25:25.920 --> 25:27.760
and I mean, really, really listen to it.

25:28.480 --> 25:30.240
And the way that he walks in the video,

25:30.240 --> 25:32.240
if you watch it, is the way that BB walks

25:32.240 --> 25:33.280
when she's got poop in her butt.

25:33.280 --> 25:34.880
Exactly, exactly.

25:34.880 --> 25:35.380
Yeah.

25:35.380 --> 25:38.980
Do you think it was, like obviously,

25:39.620 --> 25:42.580
he gets out there, he gets out there,

25:42.580 --> 25:44.340
he's walking around, steps in the moon.

25:44.340 --> 25:47.620
I'm the first man on the moon, amazing.

25:48.420 --> 25:50.100
Do you think it took him a little while

25:50.100 --> 25:53.460
before he let Buzz get out?

25:54.020 --> 25:55.860
Because he was trying to think of other things

25:55.860 --> 25:57.460
he could be the first one to do.

25:57.460 --> 25:58.660
Like, I don't know how it would,

25:59.460 --> 26:01.380
I would want to be the first person to do

26:01.380 --> 26:03.060
so many different things on the moon.

26:03.060 --> 26:06.340
It would be so irritating to know that I had to let Buzz out.

26:06.340 --> 26:08.820
Like, I want Buzz to be like,

26:08.820 --> 26:11.380
hey, hey, look at me, I just did,

26:12.100 --> 26:15.860
I just did, you know, this, I don't know,

26:15.860 --> 26:17.860
the hand jive, you know, from Grease.

26:17.860 --> 26:18.980
Yeah, yeah, sure.

26:18.980 --> 26:20.340
And he's like, no, I just actually did that,

26:20.340 --> 26:22.580
like two minutes before you came out.

26:22.580 --> 26:23.300
I totally did that.

26:23.300 --> 26:25.460
This makes so much sense to me, Justin,

26:25.460 --> 26:28.420
because if you remember when Buzz Aldrin stepped on the moon,

26:28.420 --> 26:31.780
he said, I'm the first second person on the moon.

26:31.780 --> 26:34.660
And Neil Armstrong immediately murdered him.

26:34.660 --> 26:36.260
Yeah, killed him dead.

26:37.620 --> 26:41.140
Man, I bet, do you think Buzz had a moment where he was like,

26:41.140 --> 26:42.340
I'm not even gonna get off.

26:43.060 --> 26:44.020
Fuck it.

26:44.020 --> 26:46.500
Fuck it, he's the first man on the moon.

26:46.500 --> 26:48.580
He saw Neil doing armpit farts on the moon,

26:48.580 --> 26:50.660
and he was like, man, there's nothing left.

26:50.660 --> 26:51.220
Let's go home.

26:51.220 --> 26:52.340
There's nothing left for me to do.

26:52.340 --> 26:54.100
I will say, I have-

26:54.100 --> 26:55.460
Is this Damien Chazelle?

26:55.460 --> 26:56.740
I'm ready for our interview.

26:56.740 --> 26:59.620
How's the script come along for First Man and Buzz?

26:59.620 --> 27:02.260
You're still gonna call it that, right?

27:02.260 --> 27:04.340
Like you promised First Man and Buzz?

27:05.540 --> 27:09.140
I have been very excited to go many, many places in my life.

27:09.140 --> 27:11.060
And I would say nine times out of 10,

27:11.060 --> 27:13.460
you build it up really big, and then you get there,

27:13.460 --> 27:15.300
and you're like, oh, okay.

27:15.300 --> 27:17.140
So how long do you think they were on the moon

27:17.140 --> 27:19.700
before they were just like, all right, there's nothing here.

27:20.260 --> 27:21.380
There's nothing to do.

27:21.380 --> 27:24.660
There's no TV or movies or anything.

27:24.660 --> 27:28.020
I'm gonna get back in and just head on home.

27:28.020 --> 27:30.260
You know Neil was hoping there'd be some big worms

27:30.260 --> 27:30.900
he could fight.

27:33.140 --> 27:37.380
That's half of First Man is them working on all the science

27:37.380 --> 27:42.100
and Ryan Gosling helping invent the big rocket ship

27:42.100 --> 27:43.940
and doing the zero G training.

27:43.940 --> 27:45.700
And then there's a scene where he goes

27:45.700 --> 27:47.300
and he learns how to master the katana

27:47.300 --> 27:49.220
so he can fight the big worms that he knows.

27:49.220 --> 27:51.700
He knows, I know there's gonna be big worms.

27:51.700 --> 27:52.980
He's arguing with his wife.

27:52.980 --> 27:54.420
His wife is like, why is it you?

27:54.420 --> 27:56.420
Why do you have to go and leave our family behind?

27:56.420 --> 27:58.180
He's like, I'm the only one that can kick

27:58.180 --> 27:59.700
those big worms' asses.

27:59.700 --> 28:00.900
I'm the chosen one.

28:00.900 --> 28:02.020
I'm the chosen one.

28:02.020 --> 28:05.620
Buzz still came out swinging with his katana just flying around.

28:05.620 --> 28:07.140
No, Buzz, I already got all of them.

28:07.140 --> 28:08.260
Don't worry, Neil, I'm here.

28:09.140 --> 28:10.820
Before you came out, I killed all the worms.

28:10.820 --> 28:12.580
I was the first man to kill a worm on the moon.

28:12.580 --> 28:13.860
I killed all the worms.

28:13.860 --> 28:15.620
Neil, you missed it, bud.

28:15.620 --> 28:18.740
I got worm blood all over me and it gives me powers.

28:19.540 --> 28:23.060
How often do you think during training for Neil and Buzz

28:23.060 --> 28:26.020
and probably someone else that they talk to

28:26.020 --> 28:28.500
like the head of NASA and they're like, okay,

28:28.500 --> 28:32.660
and so just in case, what do we do if there are moon men?

28:32.660 --> 28:34.420
And they're like, there's not, Neil, Buzz,

28:34.420 --> 28:35.780
there's not gonna be moon people.

28:35.780 --> 28:38.100
Like, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

28:38.100 --> 28:43.220
But if there are, what do we do?

28:47.220 --> 28:49.220
Neil, Buzz.

28:50.580 --> 28:51.700
No, no, no, I get it.

28:51.700 --> 28:54.420
There's probably, yeah, probably, probably.

28:54.420 --> 28:58.980
But do we like join their society and like integrate?

28:58.980 --> 29:01.620
Every Gimlet show I listened to this week

29:01.620 --> 29:04.180
has had first man ads on it

29:04.180 --> 29:09.540
and we just absolutely gave them a free promo spot.

29:09.540 --> 29:11.220
So you all wasted your money.

29:11.860 --> 29:13.620
I don't actually think that's true

29:13.620 --> 29:16.660
because we actually described a way more bad-ass movie

29:16.660 --> 29:19.060
than is almost certainly going to be presented to you

29:19.060 --> 29:19.860
on the silver screen.

29:20.660 --> 29:22.020
Also want to congratulate myself

29:22.020 --> 29:23.700
as we are sort of nearing the end of this bit

29:23.700 --> 29:25.700
and sort of approaching the precipice of the money zone

29:25.700 --> 29:29.300
for not ever saying Lance when describing Neil Armstrong.

29:29.300 --> 29:30.580
I've done that pretty much every time

29:30.580 --> 29:32.260
I've talked about space on podcasts before.

29:33.300 --> 29:34.100
Good job.

29:34.100 --> 29:36.820
And actually, now that I say that, I'm not sure it's true.

29:36.820 --> 29:39.700
Yeah, if we're gonna finance our own movie

29:39.700 --> 29:41.460
about Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong

29:41.460 --> 29:42.660
fighting warrants on the moon,

29:42.660 --> 29:43.700
we're gonna need some money.

29:43.700 --> 29:44.980
Let's hear the money zone.

29:44.980 --> 29:58.980
I would like to tell you about Bowl and Branch.

29:58.980 --> 30:00.260
Go nuts.

30:00.260 --> 30:01.060
Well, here's the thing.

30:01.060 --> 30:02.260
Even before we've talked about like,

30:02.260 --> 30:04.020
oh, they make great sheets and they do.

30:04.020 --> 30:06.980
Listen, their sheets, amazing.

30:06.980 --> 30:09.540
Not only comfortable, but affordable.

30:09.540 --> 30:10.420
I love them.

30:10.420 --> 30:12.500
But you know what else I love that they make?

30:12.500 --> 30:13.380
Towels.

30:13.380 --> 30:14.900
Oh, the towels are so good.

30:14.900 --> 30:17.380
My favorite towels I've ever used in my entire life.

30:17.380 --> 30:19.300
Oh, game changers.

30:19.300 --> 30:20.660
They also make blankets

30:20.660 --> 30:24.020
and everything is made from pure 100% organic cotton,

30:24.020 --> 30:25.700
which means they start out super soft

30:25.700 --> 30:28.260
and they just get softer over time.

30:28.260 --> 30:30.180
They have thousands of five-star reviews

30:30.180 --> 30:32.740
and Forbes, the Wall Street Journal and Fast Company

30:32.740 --> 30:34.660
are all talking about Bowl and Branch.

30:34.660 --> 30:37.700
Shipping is free and you can get them for 30 nights,

30:37.700 --> 30:39.620
try them for 30 nights even.

30:39.620 --> 30:42.260
And if you don't love them, send them back for a refund.

30:42.260 --> 30:44.020
But I doubt you want to send them back

30:44.020 --> 30:45.460
because you'll just want to buy more.

30:45.460 --> 30:47.540
You're not sending them back.

30:47.540 --> 30:48.740
You will not send them back.

30:48.740 --> 30:49.540
You will buy more.

30:50.580 --> 30:52.180
To get started right now,

How dare you?

31:14.020 --> 31:14.820
Yes.

31:14.820 --> 31:16.020
I am Stitch Fix.

31:16.820 --> 31:17.460
Okay.

31:17.460 --> 31:19.460
No, it's a service and not a person.

31:20.340 --> 31:20.980
Oh.

31:20.980 --> 31:22.740
Yeah, it's a clothing.

31:22.740 --> 31:24.020
That's their motto.

31:24.020 --> 31:26.260
We're a service, not a person.

31:26.260 --> 31:27.300
Stop mixing us up.

31:28.100 --> 31:31.140
Stitch Fix is an online personal styling service.

31:31.140 --> 31:31.700
What's that mean?

31:31.700 --> 31:32.900
Well, you're going to give them your measurements.

31:32.900 --> 31:34.980
You're going to tell them a little bit about your taste

31:34.980 --> 31:36.900
and they're going to send you clothes

31:36.900 --> 31:38.580
that they think will look great on you

31:38.580 --> 31:41.700
and be a great fit for sort of your own personal style

31:41.700 --> 31:42.900
in a big box.

31:42.900 --> 31:45.620
You try on the clothes, you keep only the stuff you like

31:45.620 --> 31:47.300
and the stuff you don't like, you send it back

31:47.300 --> 31:50.420
in a pre-addressed envelope.

31:50.420 --> 31:52.420
The postage is obviously already paid.

31:52.420 --> 31:54.580
You just throw it in a bag and ship it back to them

31:54.580 --> 31:55.220
if you don't like it.

31:55.220 --> 31:56.980
But you're going to like all this stuff.

31:58.420 --> 32:01.060
I have used this service for a long time.

32:01.060 --> 32:02.020
I love it.

32:02.020 --> 32:04.420
Basically all of our garments that we wear

32:04.420 --> 32:06.500
at like live shows or anything are Stitch Fix.

32:06.500 --> 32:08.660
And the cool thing is you work with your stylist

32:08.660 --> 32:10.820
to give them feedback about the stuff that they send.

32:10.820 --> 32:13.860
So if you don't like a particular shirt

32:13.860 --> 32:17.860
or too pricey, whatever, they can customize the next box

32:17.860 --> 32:19.540
to be a little bit better fit.

32:34.340 --> 32:38.340
One more time, stitchfix.com slash my brother.

32:38.340 --> 32:39.380
Got a gumbo charm here.

32:39.380 --> 32:42.340
This one's for Alex and it's from Stan who says,

32:42.340 --> 32:44.580
happy birthday or close to it.

32:44.580 --> 32:46.660
Thanks for being such a great friend, role model

32:46.660 --> 32:50.180
and for carrying me in every game of Halo we've ever played.

32:50.180 --> 32:52.660
Our whole community is so lucky to have you in our lives

32:52.660 --> 32:54.340
and we are certainly all better for it.

32:54.340 --> 32:56.500
Keep on killing it in everything you do.

32:56.500 --> 32:58.820
Here's to many more game nights, concerts

32:58.820 --> 33:00.580
and McElroy live shows.

33:00.580 --> 33:03.140
It's a sweet message, but it's a shame

33:03.140 --> 33:06.100
you can't really chip in more for the Halo matches.

33:06.100 --> 33:08.020
So I think each of us are going to give you

33:08.020 --> 33:09.700
our top number one sort of Halo tip.

33:10.420 --> 33:11.540
And we're going to start with Travis.

33:11.540 --> 33:13.780
Travis, what's your number one Halo strategy for victory?

33:14.740 --> 33:17.460
You got a romance the aliens.

33:17.460 --> 33:19.300
All right, Justin.

33:20.100 --> 33:21.540
Stegosaurus gun, baby.

33:22.340 --> 33:23.220
Which one's that?

33:23.220 --> 33:25.220
It's the one that looks like a stegosaurus

33:25.220 --> 33:27.140
with all the needles coming out of the top.

33:28.020 --> 33:29.140
Yeah, okay.

33:30.180 --> 33:31.540
That was a trap.

33:31.540 --> 33:35.860
Halo is for jokers, Xbox is for dum-dums

33:35.860 --> 33:37.060
and PlayStation's where it's at.

33:37.060 --> 33:38.580
I can't believe you guys fell for it.

33:38.580 --> 33:39.780
Jesus Christ.

33:39.780 --> 33:41.060
Dang, you did get me.

33:41.860 --> 33:42.660
You got me again.

33:43.380 --> 33:46.180
I have a message for Chris from Bonnie.

33:46.820 --> 33:50.260
Thank you for being my other half for the best 15 years.

33:50.260 --> 33:53.220
I think they meant it when they said you can't buy love.

33:53.220 --> 33:55.220
Now I know you can rent it

33:55.220 --> 33:57.940
and I'd like to renew our lease indefinitely.

33:57.940 --> 33:59.460
Happy anniversary year.

33:59.460 --> 34:02.340
I love you pants and wherever life has taken us

34:02.340 --> 34:04.180
when this airs, I'll cover you.

34:05.060 --> 34:07.140
That was extremely sweet.

34:07.140 --> 34:09.380
When they said you can't buy love.

34:09.380 --> 34:10.500
Yeah, you did need to sing that.

34:10.500 --> 34:12.100
Now I know you can rent it

34:12.100 --> 34:16.100
and I'd like to renew our lease indefinitely.

34:16.980 --> 34:17.620
That's good.

34:17.620 --> 34:18.260
There we go.

34:18.260 --> 34:19.860
Oh, like in rent.

34:19.860 --> 34:21.380
Yeah, it's a lot like rent.

34:22.740 --> 34:24.420
There's also the matter of you said-

34:24.420 --> 34:28.660
I long to discover something as true

34:28.660 --> 34:31.300
as this is.

34:31.300 --> 34:33.140
He's off mic so we can keep talking.

34:33.140 --> 34:33.460
It's fine.

34:33.460 --> 34:34.340
We don't have to cover this.

34:34.340 --> 34:35.380
We don't have to pay for it

34:35.380 --> 34:36.660
because it's off mic.

34:36.660 --> 34:38.020
It's off mic, so it's fine.

34:38.660 --> 34:40.260
Oh, now he's going to get a glass of water,

34:40.260 --> 34:40.820
it sounds like.

34:43.140 --> 34:44.500
Okay, he's using the bathroom.

34:46.980 --> 34:47.220
Okay.

34:48.740 --> 34:50.420
Now he's changing Cooper's diaper.

34:52.980 --> 34:53.220
Okay.

34:55.780 --> 34:57.460
Just let him finish.

34:57.460 --> 35:03.540
Okay, okay.

35:04.580 --> 35:04.980
All right.

35:06.100 --> 35:06.820
Travis, let him go.

35:06.820 --> 35:07.780
But it's a medley.

35:07.780 --> 35:08.980
I know, you got to let him go.

35:08.980 --> 35:10.340
You know how he gets when he's like this.

35:10.340 --> 35:11.460
You have to let him finish.

35:11.460 --> 35:12.980
I keep waiting for you guys to move on.

35:12.980 --> 35:14.500
I'll just kind of be in the background

35:14.500 --> 35:15.460
and then we'll wrap it up.

35:18.820 --> 35:20.900
I refuse to give him that relief.

35:20.900 --> 35:21.780
I'm going to just let him.

35:22.500 --> 35:24.100
Oh, like a bat out of you know where.

35:24.100 --> 35:27.140
We're out of it, we're done.

35:28.260 --> 35:30.020
That's right, damn Yankees.

35:30.020 --> 35:31.620
It's a history of Broadway.

35:32.340 --> 35:32.820
Yeah, sure.

35:32.820 --> 35:33.540
It's super good.

35:34.340 --> 35:35.380
In what order?

35:36.820 --> 35:41.700
You went from rent to damn Yankees.

35:41.700 --> 35:43.060
Thanks for coming, everybody.

35:43.060 --> 35:44.100
Now do Pippin.

35:44.100 --> 35:46.340
Rivers belong where they can ramble.

35:47.940 --> 35:51.380
Eagles belong where they can fly.

35:51.380 --> 35:51.700
Anybody else?

35:51.700 --> 35:54.260
Who is this for?

35:54.260 --> 35:55.780
What do you look for in a book?

35:55.780 --> 35:56.980
Literally if on the back it said like,

35:56.980 --> 35:58.180
this book made me shit my pants.

35:58.180 --> 35:59.780
I'd be like, I'm buying this book.

36:00.820 --> 36:02.260
I think the problem with blurbs a lot of times.

36:02.260 --> 36:05.140
I like that we both want to crap ourselves over books.

36:05.140 --> 36:07.060
What's the best way to e-read in the tub?

36:07.060 --> 36:08.260
Listen to that noise.

36:08.260 --> 36:09.940
I'm reviewing a plastic bag today.

36:11.220 --> 36:12.420
How do you find a good book?

36:12.420 --> 36:14.580
This is the most fucked up weird shit you've ever read.

36:14.580 --> 36:17.060
You're like into it, hand it over.

36:17.060 --> 36:18.420
Take my money.

36:18.420 --> 36:19.300
I'm Breah Grant.

36:19.300 --> 36:20.340
And I'm Mallory O'Mara.

36:20.340 --> 36:23.140
We're reading glasses and we solve all your bookish problems.

36:23.140 --> 36:24.740
Every Thursday on Maximum Fun.

36:27.060 --> 36:29.780
We got one more Gumbotron, right?

36:29.780 --> 36:32.500
Just lingering, waiting to be read.

36:32.500 --> 36:35.140
And it goes a little something like this.

36:35.140 --> 36:38.260
Justin, this is from all listeners to us.

36:38.980 --> 36:40.260
Damn, I loved it.

36:40.260 --> 36:42.340
The part with Justin saying,

36:42.340 --> 36:46.180
shit, I wish that had gone on for many more hours.

36:46.180 --> 36:48.420
Well, thank you so much, dear listener.

36:48.420 --> 36:50.340
You're so appreciated.

36:50.340 --> 36:56.340
A lot of fake questions in this episode.

36:56.340 --> 36:58.100
It's kind of a little bit of a trend.

36:59.060 --> 37:00.180
So what do you guys want to do now?

37:00.740 --> 37:01.380
I want you to read a question.

37:01.380 --> 37:02.340
I'm kind of hungry.

37:02.340 --> 37:03.140
I've got, oh.

37:03.140 --> 37:04.020
Oh, you're kind of hungry?

37:06.020 --> 37:06.740
Oh my God.

37:08.340 --> 37:10.180
Well, I don't know if it's going to be a junior or a big boy.

37:10.180 --> 37:10.740
What's it going to be?

37:12.180 --> 37:13.220
I want a munch.

37:13.860 --> 37:14.660
Squad.

37:14.660 --> 37:15.540
Squad.

37:15.540 --> 37:16.260
That's a big boy.

37:16.260 --> 37:19.060
I want too much.

37:19.060 --> 37:21.060
Squad junior.

37:22.260 --> 37:23.540
Oh, damn it.

37:23.540 --> 37:24.020
Mickey's.

37:24.660 --> 37:26.500
We've never featured Mickey's on the show.

37:26.500 --> 37:28.580
I don't even know what a Mickey's is.

37:28.580 --> 37:29.300
It's a deli.

37:29.300 --> 37:29.800
Holy shit.

37:30.340 --> 37:36.100
This year, they're creating a spicy, spooky Cheeto pizza.

37:37.300 --> 37:40.580
The popularity, the eerie Halloween food trend.

37:40.580 --> 37:41.780
I'm sorry.

37:41.780 --> 37:43.780
No, I don't think, is it?

37:43.780 --> 37:48.420
They had the black whopper the one time, the spooky black bun whopper.

37:48.420 --> 37:49.780
But that's about it that I know of.

37:49.780 --> 37:51.140
That was an accident, though.

37:51.140 --> 37:52.020
That was an accident.

37:52.020 --> 37:52.740
They fucked up.

37:52.740 --> 37:55.620
They let some typewriter ribbons fall into the bun maker machine.

37:57.060 --> 37:58.740
They just burned the buns real bad.

37:58.740 --> 38:02.420
This is a wild press release here on QSR.

38:02.420 --> 38:03.940
This is one sentence.

38:03.940 --> 38:07.380
With the popularity of the eerie Halloween food trend,

38:07.380 --> 38:10.820
combined with the popularity of flaming hot Cheetos, period.

38:10.820 --> 38:12.340
I don't know.

38:12.340 --> 38:14.180
Is this 2009?

38:14.180 --> 38:15.460
What the fuck are you talking?

38:15.460 --> 38:16.340
Wait, that's not a complete sentence.

38:16.340 --> 38:19.860
Have you guys seen this awesome, have you seen this hot Cheetos and talkies video?

38:19.860 --> 38:24.500
It's new from 2000 and, it's just 2000, from the year 2000.

38:24.500 --> 38:25.540
Here's another sentence.

38:26.100 --> 38:31.060
Mickey's deemed it fitting to be the first pizzeria to combine the two, period.

38:31.060 --> 38:31.780
Next sentence.

38:32.340 --> 38:32.980
The result?

38:33.860 --> 38:36.420
The spicy, spooky Cheeto pizza.

38:37.060 --> 38:38.100
Why spooky?

38:38.100 --> 38:40.660
Don't be fooled by its burnt like appearance.

38:40.660 --> 38:44.260
Upon first glance, the pizza is actually very tasty.

38:46.580 --> 38:47.860
What a press release.

38:48.900 --> 38:52.980
Hey, I know this looks like shit, but I promise we didn't fuck it up.

38:52.980 --> 38:54.820
It fucking looks like garbage.

38:54.820 --> 38:55.380
The black.

38:55.380 --> 38:57.380
Oh my God, I am looking at a JPEG of this.

38:57.380 --> 38:59.300
It looks like fucking garbage.

38:59.300 --> 39:05.540
The black hue is created by kneading activated charcoal into their fresh homemade dough.

39:05.540 --> 39:06.340
But don't worry.

39:06.340 --> 39:07.860
That's good, I'll clean your teeth.

39:07.860 --> 39:10.260
This is a press release for a pizza to eat.

39:10.820 --> 39:11.540
But don't worry.

39:11.540 --> 39:14.980
In terms of flavor, activated charcoal doesn't have much.

39:15.860 --> 39:16.900
Too much.

39:16.900 --> 39:21.940
It's got a little bit of charcoal flavor, but not much.

39:22.580 --> 39:23.780
Oh my God.

39:23.780 --> 39:29.300
Next, two type of cheeses with that possessive apostrophe cheeses are added.

39:29.300 --> 39:30.340
Oh my God.

39:30.340 --> 39:36.660
Mickey's first pizza to have multiple kinds of cheeses is in a complete sentence in this press release.

39:36.660 --> 39:43.860
The mozzarella provides a creamy, mild taste, while the cheddar gives the pizza a balance of flavor and sharpness.

39:43.860 --> 39:50.420
To top it off, flaming hot Cheetos are baked on top, adding a bit of spice to every bite,

39:50.420 --> 39:54.180
while perfectly complementing the various flavors.

39:54.180 --> 39:55.460
This is my favorite line.

39:55.460 --> 39:59.860
The spicy, spooky Cheeto pizza only comes in a size large.

40:02.260 --> 40:04.180
We know half measures.

40:04.180 --> 40:06.980
We know half measures.

40:06.980 --> 40:11.220
Yeah, you can't dip your toe in this monstrosity.

40:11.220 --> 40:13.300
You're going to eat a large and you're going to like it.

40:14.260 --> 40:18.820
I will say, we talk about food in MunchSquad a lot that I'm like, but you know what?

40:18.820 --> 40:19.780
I'd fucking eat it.

40:19.780 --> 40:22.580
I'm looking at this pizza and it looks like a crime scene.

40:22.580 --> 40:24.740
I would not eat it with my worst enemy's mouth.

40:24.740 --> 40:29.620
Speaking of which, the last sentence of this is, make sure to come by to get your, quote,

40:29.620 --> 40:33.380
Instagrammable food posts before the month ends.

40:33.380 --> 40:38.420
I don't know that we should be, and I know that we are, and the ship is sailing.

40:38.420 --> 40:39.380
We're all doomed, right?

40:39.380 --> 40:46.340
But I don't know that we should be designing foodstuffs for the visual novelty.

40:47.060 --> 40:53.140
I'm not sure we want the to be verb of all the food that we're trying to eat to be,

40:53.860 --> 40:56.420
you all have to see what I'm about to put in my body.

40:56.420 --> 40:58.340
The word I think you're looking for is ogled.

40:59.140 --> 41:00.100
Right, exactly.

41:00.100 --> 41:00.500
No.

41:00.500 --> 41:03.540
I want my dinner to be rubber-necked by passers-by.

41:03.540 --> 41:05.780
Like, how could you?

41:05.780 --> 41:10.660
Come have a chomp of our yucky stunt pizza is basically what they're saying here.

41:10.660 --> 41:13.860
Yeah, the Presley, it should just be one sentence.

41:13.860 --> 41:15.060
Is this anything?

41:15.060 --> 41:15.700
Question mark.

41:16.260 --> 41:17.940
My boss loves buying-

41:17.940 --> 41:18.740
My boss.

41:20.580 --> 41:24.980
My boss loves buying expensive imported snacks from all around the world.

41:24.980 --> 41:27.540
And then he ships them to me once a month.

41:27.540 --> 41:30.580
It's a new subscription service and I'm offering it to you.

41:30.580 --> 41:31.620
Called Ted Snacks.

41:31.620 --> 41:32.420
Ted Snacks.

41:32.420 --> 41:34.260
He picks his finest delicacies.

41:35.300 --> 41:36.820
He picks them up from all around the world.

41:36.820 --> 41:39.060
Unfortunately for me, he loves to share.

41:39.060 --> 41:43.780
The problem is whenever he goes to share a snack, he asks me to put out my hand

41:43.780 --> 41:45.780
so he can toss me out a portion.

41:46.340 --> 41:49.540
He then waits until I take my hand away.

41:49.540 --> 41:50.040
What?

41:51.380 --> 41:54.820
This is sort of an unwritten ritual as I've gotten comments like,

41:54.820 --> 41:58.420
oh, so you were just humoring me when I take too little and

41:58.980 --> 42:02.260
okay, that's enough when I have pulled away too late.

42:03.140 --> 42:04.820
Brothers, what the fuck?

42:06.100 --> 42:12.180
What is the perfect boss pleasing snack portion and dear God, how do I achieve it?

42:12.180 --> 42:13.300
That's from Panic!

42:13.300 --> 42:16.500
A Snack in Toronto.

42:16.500 --> 42:17.140
I liked it.

42:19.620 --> 42:22.100
So you stick out the hand.

42:22.100 --> 42:30.420
The boss upends a bag of German crunchums and starts pouring in your hand

42:30.420 --> 42:33.540
and then doesn't stop until you opt out.

42:33.540 --> 42:37.380
Until you have decided you have received a fair amount of German crunchums.

42:38.820 --> 42:44.020
That's the issue and sometimes you take too little, the boss thinks you think they're yucky.

42:44.020 --> 42:47.540
You take too much, the boss thinks you're trying to rob them of all their crunchums.

42:47.540 --> 42:49.540
I would say that if the boss said to me,

42:49.540 --> 42:53.300
okay, that's enough, I would look them dead in the eye and say, no, it's not.

42:53.300 --> 42:54.100
It's not enough.

42:54.100 --> 42:55.220
I love these things.

42:55.220 --> 42:55.720
More.

42:56.340 --> 42:59.140
I bet I love these and you don't want to deny me, do you?

43:00.100 --> 43:01.060
Here's one option.

43:02.340 --> 43:07.940
You can have every snack at your desk all the time

43:07.940 --> 43:11.540
and so when your boss is like, hey, you got to try these.

43:11.540 --> 43:15.540
They're Australian Pringles and he just upends the can, right?

43:15.540 --> 43:17.700
And he starts dumping them into your hand.

43:17.700 --> 43:22.100
You reach into your desk, take out your can of Australian Pringles

43:22.100 --> 43:24.260
and start dumping them onto the boss.

43:24.260 --> 43:30.820
And then it's like you've turned into a water feature of reconstituted potato granules.

43:30.820 --> 43:32.020
He's dumping them on you.

43:32.020 --> 43:34.820
You're dumping them on him and then will he pull away?

43:34.820 --> 43:36.100
Will he be the coward?

43:36.100 --> 43:36.660
I don't know.

43:36.660 --> 43:39.460
Ball's in his court because you can take them all day long.

43:40.420 --> 43:41.060
Maybe that's it.

43:41.060 --> 43:45.220
Maybe keep a bunch of gallon-sized Ziploc bags at your desk

43:45.220 --> 43:48.580
and when he comes out, you just open it up and hold it out like it's trick or treat.

43:48.580 --> 43:49.140
You know what I mean?

43:49.140 --> 43:50.980
You're just like, yep, yep, fill her up.

43:51.620 --> 43:53.940
I don't like those, but my kids will love them.

43:54.740 --> 43:56.340
Yeah, my daughter.

43:56.340 --> 43:58.820
I don't have kids, of course, but someday.

43:58.820 --> 43:59.460
My girls will love these.

43:59.460 --> 44:04.180
It sounds like your boss maybe doesn't like the snacks.

44:04.900 --> 44:08.580
The boss just likes feeling powerful and has done, right?

44:08.580 --> 44:11.860
Because if the boss did this with like, you know, some lifesavers gummies

44:11.860 --> 44:13.460
and you take a bunch of them, it's not a big deal.

44:13.460 --> 44:17.620
You just run down to the, you know, the Super America downstairs and grab some more.

44:17.620 --> 44:19.140
But these are irreplaceable.

44:19.140 --> 44:20.500
These are irreplaceable treasures.

44:20.500 --> 44:21.700
Yeah, finite.

44:21.700 --> 44:26.180
I think what you got to do is one of these times is take all of them.

44:26.820 --> 44:29.780
And so they don't take all of their, you know, chocobooms,

44:30.900 --> 44:34.580
their chocolate chocobooms, and then you take all of them.

44:34.580 --> 44:35.780
He doesn't have any more.

44:35.780 --> 44:40.740
And then you say, sorry, I took too many.

44:40.740 --> 44:43.140
And the boss says, well, shoot, I don't have any more chocobooms.

44:43.140 --> 44:46.740
And then the next time your boss probably won't even give you any more snacks.

44:46.740 --> 44:52.500
And I would say also, like, take them all and then display no remorse or shame.

44:53.060 --> 44:56.260
Because if they want to, like, shame you, like, oh, you took all my snacks.

44:56.260 --> 44:58.180
And you say, like, well, you gave me all your snacks.

44:58.180 --> 45:01.060
Yeah, I thought you were, I thought you wanted, when you came over here,

45:01.060 --> 45:03.140
I thought you wanted to give me all your chocobooms.

45:03.780 --> 45:06.340
Because I noticed that you did not reserve any for yourself.

45:06.340 --> 45:07.380
So I guess.

45:07.380 --> 45:08.900
Yeah, I thought you hated them.

45:08.900 --> 45:09.400
I guess.

45:10.500 --> 45:12.180
I just had a great idea.

45:12.180 --> 45:14.340
Next time your boss comes to you and offers you a snack,

45:14.980 --> 45:18.740
look at them in the eye and repeat this extremely powerful phrase.

45:19.780 --> 45:20.980
Does it contain saffron?

45:21.700 --> 45:24.900
I'm extremely, extremely allergic to saffron.

45:24.900 --> 45:28.580
I recently discovered that and it's made my life a lot harder.

45:28.580 --> 45:31.540
But, you know, as long as I'm smart about it, it's not usually a problem.

45:31.540 --> 45:34.500
So I will die if I eat any saffron.

45:34.500 --> 45:36.260
So how much saffron do these have in them?

45:36.260 --> 45:42.500
Can you swear on my literal life that there's no saffron in these snacks?

45:43.140 --> 45:44.740
And then you're fine.

45:45.860 --> 45:48.660
Yeah, you'll never eat another snack again for as long as you live.

45:48.660 --> 45:49.780
Yeah, but it's fine.

45:49.780 --> 45:52.820
Now, listen, y'all, can you imagine though, like, I think-

45:52.820 --> 45:53.540
What if they look good?

45:53.540 --> 45:53.860
I think Griffin's right.

45:53.860 --> 45:55.140
What if they look like really good snacks?

45:55.140 --> 45:56.100
Well, one, if they look really good.

45:56.100 --> 45:56.900
Yeah, sure.

45:56.900 --> 45:59.700
And everyone in the office is just like, mmm, these crunchums.

45:59.700 --> 46:03.380
But imagine, I think Griffin is right, but this is a power move, right?

46:03.380 --> 46:08.980
But imagine if you did, like, stick the landing, because it's like, I don't know,

46:08.980 --> 46:13.460
two and a half seconds of, like, chocums pouring is the right amount.

46:13.460 --> 46:16.900
And your boss is, like, so ready to, like, shame you one way or the other.

46:16.900 --> 46:19.860
But then you nail the amount and it's like, well, fuck.

46:19.860 --> 46:21.140
That is the perfect amount, shoot.

46:21.140 --> 46:21.700
Damn it.

46:21.700 --> 46:24.740
The boss, like, and then everyone lifts you up on their shoulders and, like,

46:24.740 --> 46:29.540
chants you out of the building as your boss dissolves into just chocums.

46:29.540 --> 46:33.700
The only way to make sure you get the perfect amount is to make your boss be the one that

46:33.700 --> 46:34.420
cuts it off.

46:34.420 --> 46:38.020
And I think the way that you can do that is when the boss comes over and says,

46:38.020 --> 46:39.380
hey, I've got some chocobooms.

46:39.380 --> 46:40.980
You want to you want to try some?

46:40.980 --> 46:42.340
You say, sure.

46:42.340 --> 46:44.180
Ah, and you just open your mouth.

46:44.180 --> 46:45.780
Yeah, yes.

46:45.780 --> 46:47.620
And the boss has to put them right in the mouth.

46:47.620 --> 46:50.740
And when he stops, you've had an I think you've had enough.

46:50.740 --> 46:52.900
And you always have your hands full.

46:52.900 --> 46:53.380
Yeah.

46:53.380 --> 46:56.900
And he reaches in your mouth to put a chocoboom on your tongue.

46:56.900 --> 47:01.380
And you chomp down and he pulls his hand back and kind of giggles like a pretty woman.

47:01.380 --> 47:02.820
Mm hmm.

47:02.820 --> 47:06.020
Or maybe he puts them in your mouth and you say, too many.

47:06.020 --> 47:06.980
You say too many.

47:07.620 --> 47:08.900
And now it's on him.

47:08.900 --> 47:10.100
Now he's the fuck up.

47:10.100 --> 47:11.300
Now he's the Malkovich.

47:12.260 --> 47:15.220
You could also just eat as many eat too little.

47:15.220 --> 47:16.260
Take too little.

47:16.260 --> 47:19.880
And he says, oh, seems like you didn't like them and you eat them and you go,

47:20.980 --> 47:22.980
Scrummy!

47:22.980 --> 47:25.060
And then you also never get snacks again.

47:25.060 --> 47:27.300
There's just so many things you could do.

47:27.300 --> 47:29.400
This is an easy one, Jesus.

47:30.260 --> 47:32.200
This one's really easy.

47:32.200 --> 47:33.240
This one's so easy.

47:33.240 --> 47:35.000
There's like 15 things you can do.

47:35.000 --> 47:36.360
It's so easy.

47:37.840 --> 47:39.180
Do you have a scapegoat in the office

47:39.180 --> 47:41.600
that you could make go first and see how many they take?

47:41.600 --> 47:42.900
And then just always take?

47:42.900 --> 47:43.800
Dial it in.

47:43.800 --> 47:44.640
Yeah.

47:44.640 --> 47:45.480
Interesting.

47:46.360 --> 47:48.340
I got a Yahoo here, y'all want it?

47:48.340 --> 47:49.180
Yeah.

47:49.180 --> 47:51.060
It was sent in by Logan, thanks Logan.

47:51.060 --> 47:56.020
It's Yahoo Answers user Tentacles87 who asks,

47:56.840 --> 48:00.660
if you want an extra cheese slice at a fancy restaurant,

48:00.660 --> 48:03.060
what is the least embarrassing way of saying it?

48:05.580 --> 48:10.580
You're at a fancy restaurant, like Bucca di Beppo,

48:11.340 --> 48:16.340
and you want, I guess I included this one mostly

48:17.040 --> 48:19.420
because I was trying to sort of split the needle,

48:19.420 --> 48:20.340
thread the needle.

48:20.340 --> 48:21.540
Well, no, I wanted to split it

48:21.540 --> 48:23.960
because I'd like to have two needles,

48:23.960 --> 48:26.660
of knowing what is a fancy restaurant

48:27.620 --> 48:32.620
that does deal in cheese slices, in slices of cheese.

48:33.220 --> 48:34.060
You can request an extra one.

48:34.060 --> 48:37.420
The only thing I can think of is like on a burger.

48:37.420 --> 48:39.760
Like a fancy, like a, yeah, yeah.

48:39.760 --> 48:44.780
Like a dude burger made out of like human meat.

48:44.780 --> 48:48.400
And that's the only sort of fancy burger I can imagine.

48:48.400 --> 48:50.300
I can't, because I can't, listen,

48:50.300 --> 48:51.140
I don't want to brag,

48:51.140 --> 48:53.660
but I'm an adult and I've ordered a cheese plate before.

48:53.660 --> 48:54.980
I don't think a cheese plate has ever come

48:54.980 --> 48:56.540
and I've said, could I get more of this,

48:56.540 --> 48:57.980
but without paying for it, please?

48:57.980 --> 48:59.580
Also, I don't think a cheese plate

48:59.580 --> 49:01.700
ever comes with slices of anything.

49:01.700 --> 49:02.920
You may get little chunks,

49:02.920 --> 49:04.500
but I don't think you can get like,

49:04.500 --> 49:06.220
I don't think they have like Kraft singles

49:06.220 --> 49:07.060
on a cheese plate.

49:07.060 --> 49:08.520
Although that would be dope.

49:09.820 --> 49:11.780
How thick does a chunk of cheese have to be

49:11.780 --> 49:14.260
before it stops being a slice?

49:14.260 --> 49:19.260
Anything thicker than a slice, it's an orientation issue.

49:19.260 --> 49:21.820
I'm just now thinking about it.

49:23.380 --> 49:27.660
Squad, why don't they have Kraft singles on cheese plates

49:27.660 --> 49:32.500
so that you know how fancy the other cheese is.

49:32.500 --> 49:33.940
You get those Kraft singles and you-

49:33.940 --> 49:35.740
Oh, a baseline cheese.

49:35.740 --> 49:36.740
They make you eat that,

49:36.740 --> 49:37.980
because whenever I eat a cheese plate,

49:37.980 --> 49:39.300
I always pretend like,

49:39.300 --> 49:41.800
mm, that one was harder to eat

49:41.800 --> 49:44.260
because of the pungent flavors.

49:44.260 --> 49:46.080
I guess that means it was good,

49:46.080 --> 49:49.460
but I don't know what makes good cheese, right?

49:49.460 --> 49:50.300
Because I'm not always-

49:50.300 --> 49:52.680
I noticed there's some weird colors

49:52.680 --> 49:55.020
and speckles in this one, is that?

49:55.020 --> 49:56.180
Oh, perfectly normal.

49:56.180 --> 49:59.020
Yes, of course, I thought it was well, good.

49:59.020 --> 50:00.620
Good and fancy, my very favorite.

50:00.620 --> 50:02.440
I ate this one and it was,

50:03.360 --> 50:05.620
it stank the inside of my mouth so bad

50:05.620 --> 50:07.280
that I started to cry a little bit,

50:07.280 --> 50:09.120
so I guess it's very good.

50:09.120 --> 50:10.300
I think the best way that you can know

50:10.300 --> 50:12.980
if the cheese is good is if you do have a Kraft single,

50:12.980 --> 50:16.060
and now you know, like, all right, that's the bar,

50:16.060 --> 50:17.900
let's see if you can clear it.

50:17.900 --> 50:22.740
I noticed that there's some skin left on this,

50:22.740 --> 50:25.500
boy, did you mean, okay, that is as intended.

50:25.500 --> 50:27.540
Do I eat that, do I eat the skin?

50:27.540 --> 50:29.140
I see here on the plate,

50:29.140 --> 50:32.060
there's a bunch of things that aren't cheese,

50:32.060 --> 50:34.100
and I assume some of them are supposed to go

50:34.100 --> 50:36.480
with some of the cheese and some of them aren't.

50:36.480 --> 50:39.060
If you could stay here and just coach me

50:39.060 --> 50:41.460
through this experience together like a doula,

50:41.460 --> 50:43.740
that would be amazing, thank you very much.

50:43.740 --> 50:46.060
It's just like, I wanna go in the back room

50:46.060 --> 50:48.540
with some of these fancy restaurants, gang,

50:48.540 --> 50:50.860
and see if the fucking Riddler is the one

50:50.860 --> 50:53.020
putting these cheese plates together.

50:53.020 --> 50:55.540
I put olives and berries on there.

50:55.540 --> 50:58.980
Okay, well now, what am I supposed to do with that?

50:58.980 --> 51:01.740
You know, you never really order soup

51:01.740 --> 51:05.900
and get a tray of cut up potatoes and chicken and stuff

51:05.900 --> 51:08.700
and a can of broth, and the chef's like,

51:08.700 --> 51:10.340
I don't know, you figure it out,

51:10.340 --> 51:12.340
whatever tastes good to you. Good luck.

51:12.340 --> 51:14.760
I'm going to give you a large chungu cheese

51:14.760 --> 51:17.620
and three crackers, and it'll be up to you

51:17.620 --> 51:18.460
to determine the portions.

51:18.460 --> 51:20.660
There should be six of everything.

51:20.660 --> 51:22.260
How are you gonna play me like that?

51:22.260 --> 51:23.780
That's what they do with Lunchables.

51:23.780 --> 51:24.620
Thank you.

51:25.560 --> 51:26.400
Run the math.

51:26.400 --> 51:29.060
Lunchables are my favorite cheese tray.

51:29.060 --> 51:31.820
For sure, how do you ask for extra cheese slice

51:31.820 --> 51:32.940
at a fancy restaurant though

51:32.940 --> 51:35.100
without being embarrassed to say it?

51:35.100 --> 51:38.220
I think you have to say like, the person next to me,

51:38.220 --> 51:39.540
they're in the bathroom right now,

51:39.540 --> 51:41.340
but they were interested in another,

51:41.340 --> 51:43.300
if you can believe it, another cheese slice.

51:43.300 --> 51:47.320
This asshole right here wants extra cheese.

51:47.320 --> 51:48.820
In slice form, please.

51:48.820 --> 51:50.020
Sliced, please.

51:50.020 --> 51:52.740
She specifically said, excuse me,

51:52.740 --> 51:55.300
I'm getting lactose intolerance tomorrow,

51:55.300 --> 51:58.860
and I want to live it up tonight.

51:58.860 --> 52:01.220
I have super lactose tolerance,

52:01.220 --> 52:05.060
and if I don't get a slice of cheese, I could go into shock.

52:05.060 --> 52:06.480
I'm gonna lose it.

52:06.480 --> 52:07.860
My body loves this stuff.

52:07.860 --> 52:10.420
My body just goes crazy for this stuff.

52:10.420 --> 52:14.180
I'm just gonna do, I have lactose intolerance,

52:14.180 --> 52:15.740
and I'm gonna do a Nicolas Cage

52:15.740 --> 52:17.460
and leaving Las Vegas thing tonight,

52:17.460 --> 52:19.860
so if you could just pile it on.

52:19.860 --> 52:22.460
I'm going to Ben and Jerry's after this.

52:22.460 --> 52:23.820
I just want to get fucking,

52:26.180 --> 52:28.180
I just want to lactate.

52:28.180 --> 52:30.340
I'm doing a lactating Las Vegas thing.

52:32.780 --> 52:34.780
We found the episode title, good.

52:34.780 --> 52:36.460
Blow me out.

52:36.460 --> 52:37.820
I was worried we weren't gonna find

52:37.820 --> 52:39.140
the episode title, but we did.

52:39.140 --> 52:43.380
Here, it's just the six minutes to midnight.

52:43.380 --> 52:44.300
You didn't even really crush it.

52:44.300 --> 52:45.180
Good work, Juice.

52:45.180 --> 52:47.540
Folks, thanks so much for listening to our show.

52:47.540 --> 52:49.820
We did our dumb book plugs at the beginning,

52:49.820 --> 52:52.580
but if you could go to bit.ly forward slash

52:52.580 --> 52:54.820
the Sawbones book and buy my book.

52:54.820 --> 52:56.260
It's out of stock in most places,

52:56.260 --> 52:57.940
but if you put it in order on Amazon,

52:57.940 --> 53:00.860
as soon as that next printing comes through,

53:00.860 --> 53:03.980
we're gonna get y'all taken care of,

53:03.980 --> 53:06.300
and that second printing is in the works,

53:06.300 --> 53:10.460
so make sure you grab one of those if you can.

53:10.460 --> 53:12.220
I will brag about it for a second and say

53:12.220 --> 53:13.980
it is an absolutely beautiful book,

53:13.980 --> 53:16.020
super fun, very well written,

53:16.020 --> 53:18.860
and even if you know someone who has never listened

53:18.860 --> 53:21.140
to the podcast before, but you know that they're interested

53:21.140 --> 53:23.580
in weird history or medical stuff

53:23.580 --> 53:26.460
or just things that are funny and good,

53:26.460 --> 53:29.340
get this book for them, for yourself.

53:29.340 --> 53:32.060
It's perfect, and we're heading towards the holidays.

53:32.060 --> 53:32.900
Oh, thank you.

53:32.900 --> 53:35.220
And it's a great holiday gift.

53:35.220 --> 53:37.420
The Adventure Zone Murder on the Rockport Limited

53:37.420 --> 53:40.460
is the other big news this week.

53:40.460 --> 53:44.700
It is available for pre-order at theadventurezonecomic.com.

53:44.700 --> 53:46.100
You pre-order your copy now,

53:46.100 --> 53:50.060
you'd be, honestly, criminally evil

53:50.060 --> 53:52.060
to not do so immediately.

53:52.060 --> 53:55.500
We've got the, we've been working on the script for a while

53:55.500 --> 53:57.020
and have started to see art from it,

53:57.020 --> 53:59.440
and this book is gonna beat ass.

53:59.440 --> 54:02.620
It is so fucking, I'm so stoked for this one to come out.

54:02.620 --> 54:04.340
This is a good one. Whipped Tushy book.

54:04.340 --> 54:05.860
You're gonna love it.

54:05.860 --> 54:08.040
So, thanks to John Roderick and the Long Winters

54:08.040 --> 54:09.560
for the use of our theme song, It's a Departure,

54:09.560 --> 54:11.380
off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

54:11.380 --> 54:13.820
Good old album, good old guy.

54:13.820 --> 54:16.100

Anything else, fellas?

54:31.140 --> 54:32.340
Also, at macklerayshows.com,

54:32.340 --> 54:36.100
I think there's still a few tickets

54:36.100 --> 54:38.820
for our November shows in Austin and Denver,

54:38.820 --> 54:39.940
if you wanna count those,

54:39.940 --> 54:43.020
both My Brother, My Brother, Me and The Adventure Zone.

54:43.020 --> 54:45.060
I know for a fact that My Brother, My Brother, Me

54:45.060 --> 54:48.140
in Austin and Denver are almost sold out,

54:48.140 --> 54:50.260
like 2% away from being sold out,

54:50.260 --> 54:53.660
and I think there's still, I don't know,

54:53.660 --> 54:55.140
some tickets for The Adventure Zone,

54:55.140 --> 54:57.060
but it is also very close to sold out.

54:57.060 --> 55:00.640
So, if you're in the Austin or Denver area in November

55:00.640 --> 55:01.700
and you wanna come to those,

55:01.700 --> 55:04.340
we are also working on a Candle Night show.

55:04.340 --> 55:06.340
We don't quite have the date yet,

55:06.340 --> 55:08.300
but that's gonna come probably

55:08.300 --> 55:10.900
around the third weekend in December.

55:10.900 --> 55:12.220
We will let y'all know, yeah, we'll firm that up.

55:12.220 --> 55:13.780
Yeah, we'll leave it over show when we have it.

55:13.780 --> 55:14.820
One more thing.

55:14.820 --> 55:16.340
Shit.

55:16.340 --> 55:19.640
At the Barnes & Noble Tribeca in New York, New York,

55:19.640 --> 55:24.140
on October 17th, Justin, Sydney, and probably Taylor, yes,

55:24.140 --> 55:27.220
are going to be doing a signing of the Sawbones book.

55:27.220 --> 55:28.380
You can see a link to that

55:28.380 --> 55:31.180

55:31.180 --> 55:32.020
Here's that final.

55:32.020 --> 55:32.980
It's sent in by Michelle Smith.

55:32.980 --> 55:33.820
Thank you, Michelle.

55:33.820 --> 55:35.620
It's an anonymous Yahoo Answers user.

55:35.620 --> 55:37.180
I'm gonna call them.

55:37.180 --> 55:38.500
Bubsy asks,

55:39.580 --> 55:43.180
is lettuce basically crunchy water?

55:43.180 --> 55:46.940
My name is Justin McElroy.

55:46.940 --> 55:48.380
I'm Travis McElroy.

55:48.380 --> 55:49.460
I'm Griffin McElroy.

55:49.460 --> 55:51.240
My brother, my brother, may kiss your dad's square

55:51.240 --> 55:52.080
on the lips.

55:52.080 --> 56:09.080
Hey girls, do you wanna just say, hey, I wanna.

56:09.080 --> 56:11.060
Maximumfun.org.

56:11.060 --> 56:12.100
Comedy and culture.

56:12.100 --> 56:13.180
Artist owned.

56:13.180 --> 56:14.380
Listener supported.

56:15.780 --> 56:16.620
Welcome.

56:16.620 --> 56:17.460
Thank you.

56:17.460 --> 56:18.280
Thanks.

56:18.280 --> 56:21.340
These are real podcast listeners, not actors.

56:21.340 --> 56:23.420
What do you look for in a podcast?

56:23.420 --> 56:25.260
Reliability is big for me.

56:25.260 --> 56:26.100
Power.

56:26.100 --> 56:27.660
I'd say comfort.

56:27.660 --> 56:29.660
What do you think of this?

56:29.660 --> 56:30.500
Oh.

56:32.860 --> 56:33.980
That's Jordan Jesse Go.

56:33.980 --> 56:35.080
Jordan Jesse Go?

56:35.080 --> 56:36.540
They came out of the floor?

56:37.460 --> 56:39.060
And down from the ceiling?

56:39.060 --> 56:40.860
That can't be safe.

56:40.860 --> 56:42.340
I'm upset.

56:42.340 --> 56:43.500
Can we go now?

56:43.500 --> 56:44.340
Soon.

56:44.340 --> 56:49.340
Jordan Jesse Go, a real podcast.
