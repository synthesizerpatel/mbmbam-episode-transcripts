WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:46.880 --> 00:52.560
We can go ahead and take out those house lights now. Yes, there they go. They're too attractive.

00:52.560 --> 00:55.200
Everyone's too attractive. It's like they were never there,

00:56.720 --> 01:02.800
still very much up these house lights are. Oh no. If anyone has a slingshot, if everybody has a

01:02.800 --> 01:08.960
slingshot, just take them out. I can see everybody way too well. All right, it's fine. I can't believe

01:08.960 --> 01:19.680
we're firing Paul. Dang. Happy candle nights. Dang, I'm going to miss Paul. Dang. Hey, happy

01:19.680 --> 01:25.520
candle nights to y'all. Joyous candle nights. You know what? I want to get a couple of thank

01:25.520 --> 01:29.680
yous out right up at the top. How about that? Sure. Like before we say the name of the podcast

01:29.680 --> 01:33.600
and there they go. Bye. Before we say the name of the podcast and everything. Fine.

01:33.600 --> 01:39.120
Welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me, an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother,

01:39.120 --> 01:53.920
Justin McElroy. I'm your sweet baby brother in 30 under 30 media luminary, Griffin McElroy.

01:53.920 --> 02:01.120
And I'm your middle brother, Travis McElroy.

02:11.680 --> 02:17.920
Thank you. Thank you. And I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I almost cursed.

02:17.920 --> 02:26.080
I almost cursed. Y'all, this is our non-cuss show. No cusses allowed. I almost cussed.

02:26.080 --> 02:31.120
Backstage, it's been like we are the keynote speakers at a cussing convention.

02:32.720 --> 02:37.520
I don't know why. Hopefully, we're just getting it out of our system. I said eight cusses just

02:37.520 --> 02:42.320
before I walked out. Just got there. I want to say very briefly, thank you, first off,

02:42.320 --> 02:46.800
to Akinpucky, a design company here in Huntington, West Virginia that has designed all of this.

02:46.800 --> 02:56.400
You also know Akinpucky as the creators of this super desk from My Brother, My Brother, Me,

02:56.400 --> 03:01.680
the limited television event. I would call it a mini-series. The My Brother, My Brother, Me

03:01.680 --> 03:05.840
mini-series. Mini-series, and also they made the clown box. You can blame them for that.

03:07.120 --> 03:11.680
And if you look over here, I would like to say thank you to Safety Town for donating

03:11.680 --> 03:20.800
this actual Safety Town car. Also, thank you to Emily Cardamas, who is here in the audience.

03:20.800 --> 03:27.520
She designed the posters for this evening. Emily, we can't bring the house lights up again. I'm

03:27.520 --> 03:33.200
sure you understand. Thank you so much for that. You can buy those in the lobby if you haven't

03:33.200 --> 03:38.560
already. What are you guys going to miss the most about cussing over the next hour?

03:38.560 --> 03:47.840
I'm going to admit, sometimes when we do a Yahoo question, they ask us a real ding-dong.

03:47.840 --> 03:52.160
Oh, yeah. And even that, how do we feel about ding-dong, folks?

03:53.120 --> 03:59.600
I meant like a bell, like a dumbbell. I meant the word, but also radical.

03:59.600 --> 04:07.920
What if I need to describe a huge butt? And my normal words for size aren't getting it across,

04:07.920 --> 04:12.880
and I'm going to be super descriptive with the size of the butt.

04:14.320 --> 04:18.160
I feel like if you say it a third time, we're bordering on dangerous territory.

04:18.160 --> 04:23.920
Hey, as long as we're teetering on that edge, I have a toilet illness tonight,

04:23.920 --> 04:30.960
a toilet illness tonight, which is not much of a surprise to anybody.

04:30.960 --> 04:33.120
Is this any first time listeners here?

04:33.120 --> 04:35.360
You might worry that you're going to get a subpar show,

04:35.360 --> 04:39.920
and I would argue you're going to get the only show that we make.

04:39.920 --> 04:46.960
Moments before I walked on the stage, this is not a lie. I did my dirty thing, and

04:46.960 --> 04:55.840
I don't want to get too blue, but somebody went on the seat,

04:55.840 --> 04:58.720
and I sat in a big wet mess, and I want to cuss about that now.

05:01.360 --> 05:03.680
I'm still coming off fresh from this horrible event.

05:04.560 --> 05:06.320
I know this is our holiday special. I shouldn't have gone that deep.

05:06.320 --> 05:08.640
I only toilet once a day, and I did it at home.

05:08.640 --> 05:08.960
Okay.

05:10.160 --> 05:11.840
It takes 45 minutes.

05:11.840 --> 05:12.240
Justin?

05:13.520 --> 05:13.760
Yes?

05:13.760 --> 05:16.080
I didn't hear you deny the wet mess.

05:17.120 --> 05:19.360
I mean, there's a lot of perpetrators here.

05:19.360 --> 05:20.880
It could have been any one of us.

05:20.880 --> 05:23.120
It could have been one of our children, Griffith.

05:23.120 --> 05:24.320
Yeah, that would be wild.

05:24.320 --> 05:25.760
Hey, do you guys mind if we maybe...

05:25.760 --> 05:27.520
Do you want to start with a Yahoo this time?

05:27.520 --> 05:28.080
All right.

05:29.040 --> 05:32.400
This is a Yahoo off the Yahoo answer service.

05:32.400 --> 05:36.480
This one was sent in by Adrian Cowles, who I believe is also here tonight

05:36.480 --> 05:44.320
after a half-day-long trek to get to Huntington, West Virginia.

05:44.320 --> 05:47.440
Thank you for all of your wonderful, wonderful gifts.

05:47.440 --> 05:48.400
I'm super curious.

05:48.400 --> 05:50.240
How many people here are from out of town?

05:52.000 --> 05:52.720
So all of them.

05:55.840 --> 05:58.240
Did any of our hometown friends manage to get tickets?

05:59.440 --> 05:59.760
All right.

06:01.120 --> 06:01.920
Well done.

06:01.920 --> 06:02.960
So thank you, Adrian.

06:02.960 --> 06:05.200
This one is an anonymous Yahoo answers user.

06:05.200 --> 06:07.280
I'm going to call Billion.

06:08.160 --> 06:12.320
Asks, is it better to smoke a cigarette or vape

06:12.320 --> 06:14.800
during an open-air Christmas carol service?

06:18.800 --> 06:19.360
Huh.

06:19.360 --> 06:23.200
We shall stand at the back where most of the smokers gather.

06:23.920 --> 06:26.000
How big is this carol service?

06:26.640 --> 06:27.360
Point number two.

06:27.360 --> 06:28.800
So how cool is it?

06:28.800 --> 06:32.720
Point number two, there will be lots of kids present.

06:32.720 --> 06:36.160
Huh.

06:36.160 --> 06:39.680
That last one is a sticky wicket, because you don't want to smoke

06:40.240 --> 06:43.680
that cigarette smog around the children, because it's,

06:43.680 --> 06:47.040
you know, according to doctors, not good for them.

06:47.040 --> 06:50.960
But if they see you vaping, they're going to want to do that right now.

06:50.960 --> 06:52.880
No, they're going to try to steal your vape.

06:52.880 --> 06:55.200
Hey, old man, let me get at that jewel real quick.

06:55.200 --> 06:58.240
I saw that jewel in a Fortnite dance.

06:58.240 --> 07:02.560
Hey, let me fortnight at that jewel,

07:02.560 --> 07:03.760
real quick, old man.

07:03.760 --> 07:05.920
I'm going to fortnight all over the place.

07:05.920 --> 07:09.200
Hey, you care if I fortnight real quick with that jewel?

07:09.200 --> 07:10.480
Step back, I'm going to fortnight.

07:10.480 --> 07:12.800
Hey, careful, I got a fortnight brewing in my tummy.

07:13.520 --> 07:14.240
Here's what you do.

07:14.800 --> 07:15.440
Here's what you do.

07:15.440 --> 07:16.560
You just pretend like, you know,

07:16.560 --> 07:19.040
oh, I can see my breath as you're ripping mad cotton.

07:19.040 --> 07:19.600
Heck yeah.

07:20.880 --> 07:22.080
Oh, it's so cold in here.

07:23.200 --> 07:24.000
So chilly.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.320
They'll be like, Tyler, this is Fort Lauderdale.

07:26.320 --> 07:29.120
It's 63 degrees outside.

07:29.120 --> 07:33.920
Man, you got to do one of them though, huh?

07:35.920 --> 07:38.640
That's what it's called, an addiction.

07:40.800 --> 07:42.480
I like that in this question,

07:42.480 --> 07:46.720
there is not an option of not going to the open air candlelight

07:46.720 --> 07:48.400
or caroling service or whatever.

07:48.400 --> 07:52.480
Like, well, I have to go, but I also have to vape.

07:54.160 --> 07:56.160
There's a smoker section.

07:56.160 --> 07:57.360
That's what's wild to me.

07:57.360 --> 07:58.240
It's tripping me out.

07:58.240 --> 08:01.200
If I get a group of carolers coming to my...

08:01.200 --> 08:01.680
What is it?

08:01.680 --> 08:02.480
Is this a state?

08:02.480 --> 08:03.760
Am I coming to them?

08:03.760 --> 08:05.440
Because if so, you're not carolers.

08:05.440 --> 08:08.400
You're just a choir doing a performance outdoors.

08:08.400 --> 08:08.960
But okay.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
I feel like if I'm seeing a group of, you know,

08:12.720 --> 08:14.560
people singing Deck the Halls at me

08:14.560 --> 08:19.760
and in the back I see a bunch of, you know, army grandpas

08:22.080 --> 08:24.320
chiefing their vapes.

08:24.320 --> 08:30.560
So what is the best vape flavor for a caroling service?

08:30.560 --> 08:31.120
Cigarette.

08:34.800 --> 08:36.400
I'm going to say pine.

08:36.400 --> 08:37.200
That's nice.

08:37.200 --> 08:38.720
What about frankincense?

08:38.720 --> 08:41.760
Pine is one of those rare vape flavors

08:41.760 --> 08:44.240
that is better for the people around you

08:44.240 --> 08:46.320
than it is for the people putting it in their mouth.

08:47.200 --> 08:48.480
Those are great choices.

08:48.480 --> 08:49.440
What about snow?

08:51.280 --> 08:51.760
Fresh.

08:52.720 --> 08:53.120
Chris.

08:53.120 --> 08:55.760
What about one just called... I'll make one called Santa Claus.

08:56.800 --> 08:57.520
Yeah.

08:57.520 --> 08:58.400
Baby Jesus.

08:58.960 --> 08:59.440
Yeah.

08:59.440 --> 09:00.160
And there it was.

09:00.720 --> 09:02.400
That was our exit ramp.

09:02.400 --> 09:04.480
While we wait for Justin to unlock his iPad.

09:04.480 --> 09:07.920
I have questions from you, our beloved audience members.

09:07.920 --> 09:08.880
I'm going to read them right now.

09:12.400 --> 09:16.400
I did a bunch of gift shopping at Half Price Books

09:16.400 --> 09:17.760
as I do every year.

09:17.760 --> 09:19.440
I got my seven-year-old nephew

09:19.440 --> 09:22.400
two books of Lego construction ideas and instructions.

09:22.400 --> 09:24.160
When I got home, I discovered one of the books

09:24.160 --> 09:27.280
has an inscription stating it was a gift for Clay

09:27.280 --> 09:30.000
from his loving grandpam in 2011.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.200
His loving what now?

09:31.200 --> 09:33.440
Grandpam in 2011.

09:33.440 --> 09:35.360
It is I, grandpam.

09:36.480 --> 09:39.200
It is written in large letters on the front page.

09:39.840 --> 09:42.080
Do I wrap the book as is knowing my nephew

09:42.080 --> 09:43.680
will understand the nature of used books

09:43.680 --> 09:45.600
and that is the reason he is getting two books

09:45.600 --> 09:46.400
instead of just one?

09:46.960 --> 09:51.520
Or do I try and hide the inscription somehow?

09:51.520 --> 09:53.280
Do I add a note saying something like,

09:53.280 --> 09:54.960
I guess Clay didn't like this book too much.

09:56.400 --> 09:57.680
But I bet you will.

09:57.680 --> 10:00.320
In an attempt to appeal to my nephew's sense of humor,

10:00.320 --> 10:03.200
that's from Festive Faux Pas in Fort Worth.

10:03.200 --> 10:03.760
Are you here?

10:04.960 --> 10:05.760
Oh, too bad.

10:08.240 --> 10:10.480
Fort Worth is pretty far from here.

10:10.480 --> 10:14.880
First of all, they make books that don't come with Legos

10:14.880 --> 10:18.000
that are just some ideas for things you can build with Legos.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.360
That is wild to me.

10:19.360 --> 10:21.120
Like, I don't know, a building?

10:21.120 --> 10:22.480
Maybe a car?

10:22.480 --> 10:23.360
Castle?

10:23.360 --> 10:23.840
I don't know.

10:23.840 --> 10:25.040
You kids like dinosaurs?

10:25.600 --> 10:27.120
You got a lot of green ones?

10:28.880 --> 10:34.480
Could you write after the word Clay, the word Aiken?

10:34.480 --> 10:35.040
And now-

10:36.000 --> 10:37.280
That's a collector's piece.

10:37.280 --> 10:37.440
Yes.

10:38.160 --> 10:42.000
You can sell that back to the bookstore for $25.

10:42.000 --> 10:46.240
Can you write over Clay, after Clay, write face.

10:47.040 --> 10:48.640
Please change your ways.

10:48.640 --> 10:49.520
Love, Batman.

10:49.520 --> 10:52.160
And enjoy the book.

10:52.160 --> 10:52.880
Grandpam.

10:53.440 --> 10:55.920
Don't get any Legos stuck inside of you

10:55.920 --> 10:57.280
and your gelatinous body.

10:58.400 --> 10:59.200
P.S.

10:59.200 --> 11:00.160
Commissioner Fort.

11:00.160 --> 11:01.120
Man, Clayface is-

11:01.680 --> 11:03.840
You don't really think about Clayface that often, do you?

11:04.400 --> 11:05.120
All the time.

11:05.120 --> 11:06.000
I'm going to make you-

11:06.000 --> 11:09.440
Because I bet he gets dirty after a day of just existing.

11:10.320 --> 11:13.280
Clayface blorps around the city trying to cause crime,

11:13.280 --> 11:14.240
but then he gets home.

11:14.240 --> 11:15.360
How does he wash up?

11:15.360 --> 11:16.000
He's mud.

11:16.000 --> 11:16.560
Yeah.

11:16.560 --> 11:18.720
But he's covered in cigarette butts.

11:18.720 --> 11:20.400
Clayface's favorite joke is

11:20.400 --> 11:21.920
after he hangs out with a bunch of criminals

11:21.920 --> 11:22.960
at the end of the night, he's like,

11:22.960 --> 11:25.840
well, I guess I'm going to go to sleep in a bed.

11:29.280 --> 11:31.200
That's a great joke, Clayface.

11:31.200 --> 11:31.680
Yeah.

11:31.680 --> 11:33.280
The audience loved it, fake Clayface.

11:33.280 --> 11:34.080
I'm just kidding.

11:34.080 --> 11:36.720
I have to lay on the ground because I'm Clayface.

11:36.720 --> 11:37.680
Yeah, sure.

11:37.680 --> 11:39.360
Like, what are his other options?

11:39.360 --> 11:42.080
Does he maintain a solid form as he rests?

11:42.080 --> 11:42.960
I don't think so.

11:42.960 --> 11:44.240
Can you tear the page out?

11:44.880 --> 11:46.240
Is it the cover?

11:46.240 --> 11:46.800
Front page.

11:46.800 --> 11:48.160
It's probably written on the-

11:48.160 --> 11:48.960
Thank you for the correction.

11:48.960 --> 11:49.840
Someone in the audience just said no.

11:51.600 --> 11:53.200
I mean, that first page is going to have

11:53.200 --> 11:54.640
a lot of important details.

11:54.640 --> 11:56.240
The publisher information.

11:56.240 --> 11:59.200
The IBSN number, is that it?

11:59.200 --> 12:00.000
It's close enough.

12:00.000 --> 12:00.960
It says-

12:00.960 --> 12:02.000
The IBS number?

12:04.640 --> 12:07.040
Don't use Duplo blocks on this book.

12:07.040 --> 12:07.920
It's rich.

12:07.920 --> 12:08.640
Oh, no!

12:08.640 --> 12:09.140
No!

12:13.600 --> 12:15.040
Put a quarter in the jar.

12:15.040 --> 12:17.680
Put a quarter in the jar.

12:17.680 --> 12:18.560
We made it.

12:18.560 --> 12:19.600
13 minutes.

12:20.960 --> 12:21.840
That goes-

12:21.840 --> 12:22.800
Yeah, what do you got, Griff?

12:22.800 --> 12:24.160
What's going on recovery points tonight?

12:24.160 --> 12:24.640
What do they got?

12:25.200 --> 12:27.040
So that's just your credit card.

12:27.040 --> 12:27.540
Okay.

12:28.320 --> 12:30.320
And now I'm going to read the numbers out.

12:30.320 --> 12:32.480
Whatever they feel is fair.

12:34.240 --> 12:35.280
There's no numbers.

12:35.280 --> 12:35.840
Okay.

12:35.840 --> 12:36.800
What is this?

12:36.800 --> 12:37.300
All right.

12:37.920 --> 12:39.280
It's a blockbuster gift card.

12:40.960 --> 12:42.000
That's my one.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.240
I cussed because I was angry at Travis for

12:44.240 --> 12:46.640
dumping on my joke.

12:47.840 --> 12:48.800
How about another Yahoo?

12:50.240 --> 12:53.200
Now I'm on point because I'm only 13 minutes in and I used mine.

12:54.800 --> 12:56.080
Charlotte sent this one in.

12:56.080 --> 12:56.720
Thank you, Charlotte.

12:56.720 --> 13:00.240
It's Yahoo Answers user dgirl who asks,

13:01.040 --> 13:03.520
how does Santa get away with having his elves put together

13:03.520 --> 13:07.040
and give away toys that are trademarked or patented by other entities?

13:09.840 --> 13:10.340
Yes.

13:10.960 --> 13:12.080
Additional details.

13:12.080 --> 13:16.240
Is he above the law?

13:16.240 --> 13:18.480
Geographically speaking, yes.

13:20.000 --> 13:23.360
I have seen a lot of movies where they arrest Santa.

13:23.360 --> 13:23.920
Yeah.

13:23.920 --> 13:26.160
It happens a lot.

13:26.160 --> 13:27.040
Yeah.

13:27.040 --> 13:29.120
It's like to the point now,

13:29.120 --> 13:32.240
if in real life I was a police officer and I arrested somebody

13:32.240 --> 13:35.360
and they're like, I'm Santa, I'd be like, oh, statistically,

13:35.360 --> 13:36.400
it's probably true.

13:37.920 --> 13:38.160
Yeah.

13:38.160 --> 13:38.720
Go on.

13:38.720 --> 13:41.040
So, I mean, like, walk it through there, right?

13:41.040 --> 13:42.240
Is he above the law?

13:42.240 --> 13:44.240
Santa shows up at the police officer's house.

13:44.240 --> 13:47.360
He's got a bunch of licensed toys and the officer's like,

13:47.360 --> 13:48.800
I got to arrest you, Santa.

13:48.800 --> 13:50.720
And Santa's like, all right, let's go.

13:51.680 --> 13:52.560
Just kidding.

13:52.560 --> 13:56.720
I can be everywhere at once and I'm immortal and okay, let's go.

13:56.720 --> 13:59.120
Like, are you going to catch me if you can, Santa?

13:59.120 --> 13:59.620
Yeah.

13:59.620 --> 14:00.320
I don't think so.

14:01.520 --> 14:03.440
Is Santa invincible?

14:03.440 --> 14:03.940
No.

14:03.940 --> 14:04.240
Sorry.

14:04.240 --> 14:05.440
I've seen the Santa Claus.

14:05.440 --> 14:06.960
He's not invincible.

14:06.960 --> 14:08.480
Is Santa invincible?

14:08.480 --> 14:12.800
If, if, if, if you arrest Santa and you put him in the back

14:12.800 --> 14:16.240
of the police car, can he, using Santa magic,

14:16.240 --> 14:17.920
escape the car through the exhaust pipe?

14:17.920 --> 14:18.420
Yes.

14:20.080 --> 14:21.520
If he chooses.

14:21.520 --> 14:24.640
The exhaust pipe is the chimney of the car.

14:24.640 --> 14:27.120
Sometimes the police officer has a lesson to learn about,

14:27.120 --> 14:29.760
I don't know, love or Christmas, magic, or joy or whatever.

14:29.760 --> 14:32.640
So Santa could escape at any moment, but he's choosing not to.

14:32.640 --> 14:35.680
And instead, he maybe does like a rock musical number

14:35.680 --> 14:37.040
in the jail cell.

14:37.040 --> 14:37.760
That's good.

14:37.760 --> 14:41.040
I mean, Santa's got a guy, right?

14:41.040 --> 14:42.080
A wholesale guy.

14:42.080 --> 14:42.720
You know what I mean?

14:43.440 --> 14:46.000
Santa's real magic is he's got a toy guy.

14:46.640 --> 14:48.480
A box of stuff that falls off the truck.

14:48.480 --> 14:50.160
Hey, a few things fell off the truck.

14:51.360 --> 14:52.000
Santa.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.560
Or maybe the other side, maybe the wholesale people,

14:54.560 --> 14:57.280
maybe like Walmart has a contract with Santa.

14:57.280 --> 15:00.160
It's like, okay, Christmas, it's all yours to distribute.

15:00.160 --> 15:02.080
The other 11 months of the year, though,

15:02.080 --> 15:03.520
please do send that to us.

15:03.520 --> 15:05.200
The cell will kick some back to you.

15:05.200 --> 15:07.040
Santa could probably be like, I mean,

15:07.040 --> 15:10.000
I give it away so it's technically fair use.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.200
And they'd say, that's not fair.

15:11.200 --> 15:13.280
That's not how any of this works, Santa.

15:13.280 --> 15:13.920
Goodbye.

15:13.920 --> 15:15.760
I'm at 30 houses away.

15:15.760 --> 15:16.260
Bye.

15:17.200 --> 15:22.560
Is it possible that Santa did make the Nintendo

15:22.560 --> 15:28.000
and the monster cards and Battle Boy

15:28.000 --> 15:31.280
and all the hot toys for this candlelight season?

15:31.280 --> 15:33.760
Oh, man, I got a Battle Boy.

15:33.760 --> 15:34.320
All right.

15:34.320 --> 15:38.480
He's the boy that will leap into the fray.

15:38.480 --> 15:40.960
He's the boy that's going to save the day.

15:40.960 --> 15:43.040
Everybody get out of the way.

15:43.040 --> 15:44.720
It's Battle Boy.

15:51.120 --> 15:54.480
Fun Stix, all the hot toys from 2018.

15:55.680 --> 15:57.040
Good Wheels, you know.

15:59.440 --> 16:01.280
That doesn't explain why none of the toys

16:01.280 --> 16:04.960
are spelled right that you get from Santa.

16:04.960 --> 16:06.720
I got a Ben Tendo.

16:06.720 --> 16:08.320
Jim Tendo 63.

16:13.840 --> 16:15.360
With a copy of Golden Guy.

16:20.080 --> 16:20.720
I'm currently.

16:21.600 --> 16:23.840
Hey, no slop job when we're playing Golden Guy.

16:24.720 --> 16:25.600
It's not fair.

16:25.600 --> 16:26.640
Clappers only.

16:26.640 --> 16:27.140
Hey.

16:31.200 --> 16:32.800
Slop job probably isn't good.

16:35.600 --> 16:38.720
We're definitely pushing a mountain here doing that one.

16:42.080 --> 16:42.800
Oh, no.

16:44.160 --> 16:47.040
I'm coming off as a real Howard Stern type up here.

16:48.800 --> 16:52.480
I'm currently sitting in a well-known sandwich establishment.

16:52.480 --> 16:55.120
I have replaced your brother Justin with a droid.

16:55.120 --> 16:56.560
No, it's just a question.

16:59.360 --> 17:01.840
Waiting for a call that my car inspection is finished.

17:01.840 --> 17:05.440
When a man started to do a Christmas rock set at noon.

17:06.400 --> 17:06.880
Stop.

17:07.520 --> 17:11.840
What sandwich chain do they do live music at?

17:12.720 --> 17:13.680
I mean, it's well known.

17:14.400 --> 17:16.400
When a subway with a stage in the corner.

17:16.400 --> 17:17.840
Probably a subway with a stage in the corner.

17:17.840 --> 17:20.560
Currently, he is facing me and I am the only.

17:20.560 --> 17:21.920
Maybe Potbelly.

17:21.920 --> 17:24.080
I was thinking Potbelly is pretty slick.

17:24.080 --> 17:27.280
When a man has started Christmas, I currently he is facing me.

17:27.280 --> 17:30.160
And I am the only patron in the establishment.

17:33.040 --> 17:35.680
Brother, I blow it up from the inside and survive.

17:36.960 --> 17:39.680
What is the protocol for being the only audience member?

17:39.680 --> 17:41.920
Should I clap solo between songs?

17:41.920 --> 17:44.640
I've taken one earbud out and done some.

17:46.960 --> 17:48.160
That was your first mistake.

17:48.160 --> 17:50.480
Yeah, I've done some intermittent foot taps.

17:50.480 --> 17:53.680
Oh, but what should I do?

17:54.400 --> 17:56.480
Punny names are hard in Baltimore.

17:56.480 --> 17:57.040
Are you here?

17:57.920 --> 17:59.200
God bless you wherever you are.

17:59.200 --> 18:02.640
I'm probably still trapped in that sandwich, folks.

18:02.640 --> 18:06.080
I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I don't have a lot of rules for living.

18:06.080 --> 18:07.200
Here's my number one.

18:08.240 --> 18:11.120
If you see someone carrying an amp, finish your sandwich.

18:12.880 --> 18:16.560
Especially if you look around and there's no one else in the room.

18:16.560 --> 18:18.240
Hold on, I think they might have been writing it down.

18:18.240 --> 18:23.760
I'll repeat, if you see someone carrying an amp, finish your sandwich.

18:24.320 --> 18:25.120
Unless.

18:25.120 --> 18:25.680
How did you?

18:25.680 --> 18:26.400
No, no.

18:27.280 --> 18:28.000
Unless.

18:28.000 --> 18:28.480
Unless.

18:30.960 --> 18:32.160
It's not, but fine.

18:33.040 --> 18:38.160
What if it's 2006 and the person with the guitar and amp is a young Jason Mraz?

18:38.160 --> 18:38.720
Okay, no.

18:40.480 --> 18:43.360
You let yourself, you knew you were the only one in there.

18:43.360 --> 18:44.000
Yeah.

18:44.000 --> 18:49.600
You saw them carrying the amp and some part of you was like, mm.

18:49.600 --> 18:51.200
Let's see, nice.

18:52.480 --> 18:54.000
I can't imagine where this is going.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.720
A little mid-lunch music.

18:56.720 --> 19:00.400
Another thing, you pulled out a headphone and the earbud was like, huh?

19:00.400 --> 19:04.800
Like, not both, you monster.

19:04.800 --> 19:05.680
Yeah, this.

19:05.680 --> 19:06.720
Oh, that's what you do.

19:06.720 --> 19:10.000
If they play a really good song, you reach up and you take the other one out like, okay.

19:10.880 --> 19:12.640
Now you've got me, reel me in.

19:12.640 --> 19:15.120
Do you have a CD I can buy for $2?

19:15.120 --> 19:20.160
If they play a bad song, which this potbelly live music act almost certainly will,

19:20.160 --> 19:21.760
you pop the other one back in.

19:22.480 --> 19:23.440
You gotta earn it.

19:23.440 --> 19:24.480
You rappin' bad.

19:26.320 --> 19:29.920
This is where you, hopefully you have this in your bag, but you pull out like a clipboard

19:29.920 --> 19:32.400
and a pen, they finish the song, you go, hmm.

19:32.400 --> 19:34.480
And like, take notes and write it down.

19:34.480 --> 19:35.520
And then, okay.

19:35.520 --> 19:37.360
And then say, I think I've got everything I need.

19:38.080 --> 19:38.800
Oh, God.

19:40.480 --> 19:40.960
That's good.

19:40.960 --> 19:43.440
I think I've seen enough.

19:43.440 --> 19:46.160
Can you pull your phone out?

19:46.160 --> 19:49.200
And I don't know what I'm gonna say here, so I'm really just kind of generating it

19:49.200 --> 19:50.720
as I fly, which is always fun.

19:51.520 --> 19:57.040
But like, do a FaceTime with someone so you have a buddy there for the performance

19:57.040 --> 19:58.160
so you're not alone.

19:58.160 --> 19:59.040
Maybe it's your great-

19:59.040 --> 20:00.800
Hey, remember that new sound you've been looking for?

20:00.800 --> 20:01.040
Yeah.

20:03.600 --> 20:07.200
Listen to this, and then you set the phone down on the table and walk away.

20:07.200 --> 20:11.440
Now, bad news, you lost a phone.

20:11.440 --> 20:16.800
Worst news, you might've lost a friend, but you get to go home.

20:16.800 --> 20:23.520
Can you say, could you kind of cover your mouth and be like, whoever had the Honda Pilot,

20:23.520 --> 20:27.920
your car's done, so you better come get it, or we're gonna throw it away, so you better

20:27.920 --> 20:30.080
hurry up and get here, and you just run away.

20:30.080 --> 20:34.160
You write that down on a note and hand it to the guitarist to read out loud to the crowd.

20:34.160 --> 20:34.800
Then it's more authentic.

20:34.800 --> 20:36.400
And then you go, wait, that's me!

20:36.400 --> 20:37.600
That's my Honda Pilot.

20:37.600 --> 20:40.960
What if you just yell, I'm allergic to sandwich, I forgot!

20:40.960 --> 20:41.920
And then you run out.

20:44.480 --> 20:46.720
I have to get to the hospital, quick!

20:46.720 --> 20:48.720
That's probably the worst suggestion, Travis.

20:48.720 --> 20:49.840
That doesn't even make sense.

20:51.120 --> 20:53.680
How could you be allergic to a construction of food?

20:54.560 --> 20:55.600
What are we doing here?

20:55.600 --> 20:56.880
It's the holidays.

20:56.880 --> 20:57.760
You're right, Justin.

20:58.640 --> 20:59.760
Y'all want to know who?

20:59.760 --> 21:00.560
Oh, yeah.

21:01.920 --> 21:04.160
Cool, this one was sent in by Graham Roebuck.

21:04.160 --> 21:04.880
Thank you, Graham.

21:04.880 --> 21:07.920
It's anonymous, no, wait, they're not anonymous.

21:07.920 --> 21:11.520
The website has been on the naughty list.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.360
Yeah, and it just ain't going to work.

21:15.360 --> 21:18.640
So I'm gonna call them, Dravens asks.

21:19.360 --> 21:20.560
I like the plural.

21:20.560 --> 21:23.840
What does, it's more than one person sent in.

21:23.840 --> 21:25.200
The Dravens.

21:25.200 --> 21:30.160
What does Santa Claus and the Christmas people do on Easter?

21:30.160 --> 21:36.240
These chairs sure are a moving and a wiggling, huh?

21:36.240 --> 21:36.800
I like it.

21:36.800 --> 21:38.080
I'm getting the ab workout.

21:38.080 --> 21:38.560
Yeah, same.

21:38.560 --> 21:40.800
I imagine this is what sitting on a yoga ball is like.

21:40.800 --> 21:45.680
We filmed a special limited television event in these chairs

21:45.680 --> 21:47.760
and the rolling was a constant issue.

21:47.760 --> 21:49.680
That's why we keep our hands on the desk.

21:49.680 --> 21:51.680
Scoling about 24 hours a day.

21:51.680 --> 21:54.080
The thing about it that a lot of people don't know

21:54.080 --> 21:56.000
is that Santa and the elves are Jewish.

21:56.000 --> 22:00.640
That's why they work on Christmas.

22:00.640 --> 22:03.120
Okay, okay, fun.

22:04.400 --> 22:07.360
So they don't do anything on Easter except probably work.

22:07.360 --> 22:08.640
Yeah, probably not.

22:09.520 --> 22:10.080
I don't know.

22:11.040 --> 22:12.560
Ask Dan an answer.

22:12.560 --> 22:13.680
I don't know, Trav.

22:15.680 --> 22:18.560
If you think about it conceptually,

22:19.600 --> 22:21.600
when you think about the reason for the season,

22:22.800 --> 22:25.840
Easter is pretty much the opposite of Christmas.

22:25.840 --> 22:26.340
Huh?

22:27.920 --> 22:31.360
In a lot of ways, if you think about it,

22:33.200 --> 22:36.400
why we do the both of them,

22:37.120 --> 22:41.840
it's kind of opposite ends of a life.

22:43.520 --> 22:44.320
Oh, okay.

22:45.600 --> 22:47.040
Oh, all right.

22:47.040 --> 22:50.160
So they probably resented as much as the Easter people

22:50.800 --> 22:51.920
resent Christmas.

22:52.800 --> 22:53.520
Oh, I see.

22:53.520 --> 22:54.020
I...

22:55.680 --> 22:56.560
Maybe on Easter,

22:57.360 --> 22:59.920
Santa and the Christmas people celebrate Christmas

23:00.480 --> 23:02.480
because that's their time to do it.

23:02.480 --> 23:03.360
That's when they observe it.

23:03.360 --> 23:05.120
That doesn't make any sense either, Travis.

23:05.120 --> 23:06.800
You're posting up a lot at Dookie tonight.

23:08.400 --> 23:09.760
How do we feel about Dookie?

23:09.760 --> 23:12.880
I want to dig into the fact that Santa Claus is Jewish.

23:12.880 --> 23:13.380
Okay.

23:14.160 --> 23:16.080
In the scenario you have supposed,

23:17.120 --> 23:20.960
Santa Claus is an immortal Jewish man

23:20.960 --> 23:24.080
who, when Jesus was born, was like,

23:24.880 --> 23:27.280
I don't think this kid is anything special

23:27.840 --> 23:30.000
and I'm going to throw him the greatest birthday party

23:30.960 --> 23:34.320
every year for the rest of my life.

23:36.320 --> 23:36.820
Yeah.

23:37.600 --> 23:38.100
Okay.

23:38.560 --> 23:41.120
Well, Jesus was Jewish.

23:41.120 --> 23:41.680
Yes.

23:41.680 --> 23:44.240
So Santa was like, all right, let's do this.

23:44.240 --> 23:46.080
And then at a certain point, it veered away

23:46.080 --> 23:49.440
and Santa was like, oh no, what about the reason for the season?

23:49.440 --> 23:49.940
Yeah.

23:50.560 --> 23:51.840
My cool party.

23:51.840 --> 23:53.440
My cool party I'm doing.

23:57.280 --> 24:00.560
When Santa celebrates Christmas on Easter, Travis,

24:00.560 --> 24:02.000
the other foolish thing that you've said-

24:02.000 --> 24:03.280
I'll turn to my left now.

24:04.480 --> 24:08.480
Is he waiting for him to come down the chimney?

24:11.520 --> 24:13.200
So you're supposing that at night,

24:13.200 --> 24:15.120
Santa goes to sleep thinking,

24:15.120 --> 24:17.040
boy, I hope I bring me some cool stuff.

24:17.040 --> 24:19.440
He puts cookies out for himself and says,

24:19.440 --> 24:20.720
boy, I hope I like these.

24:23.600 --> 24:24.480
Justin.

24:24.480 --> 24:26.480
My mother loves Santa Claus.

24:26.480 --> 24:27.920
Yeah, heck yeah.

24:27.920 --> 24:29.040
That's two.

24:29.040 --> 24:31.200
That's two, that's two.

24:31.200 --> 24:34.400
They can say that one on Friends, it's okay.

24:34.400 --> 24:36.560
My mother loves Santa Claus much to the point

24:36.560 --> 24:40.240
where she has him decorated in her house all year round.

24:41.040 --> 24:45.360
Not Christmas decorations all year, just Santa.

24:45.360 --> 24:46.080
Sure.

24:46.080 --> 24:48.400
That is an interesting distinction to make.

24:49.040 --> 24:51.120
Not Christmas decorations, just Santa.

24:51.120 --> 24:52.240
I never thought it was weird,

24:52.880 --> 24:55.520
but a friend of mine recently pointed out how weird it was.

24:55.520 --> 24:56.960
It's a bold friend?

24:56.960 --> 24:59.200
When I asked my mother why she had so many,

24:59.840 --> 25:01.120
she just said she likes him.

25:02.720 --> 25:05.600
Is this weird or is my friend just being a jerk?

25:05.600 --> 25:08.000
That's from Cold for Christmas in Columbus.

25:08.000 --> 25:08.560
Are you here?

25:10.560 --> 25:12.160
Because she likes him,

25:12.160 --> 25:14.560
the only other option response is like,

25:14.560 --> 25:18.320
huh, you're right, I do have a lot of Santa stuff.

25:18.320 --> 25:19.760
That is so weird.

25:19.760 --> 25:22.480
Hey, he's a cool guy.

25:22.480 --> 25:22.980
Yeah.

25:23.680 --> 25:27.360
Like why can't we just celebrate this cool guy all year round?

25:27.360 --> 25:27.860
Yeah.

25:28.320 --> 25:29.920
No, no.

25:29.920 --> 25:30.420
Okay.

25:32.160 --> 25:35.760
Because I'm thinking about it and that's unacceptable.

25:36.800 --> 25:37.680
Tell me why, tell me why.

25:37.680 --> 25:40.720
How are you going to miss Santa Claus if he's always there?

25:40.720 --> 25:43.600
Yeah, it's just like how we only put up the American flag

25:43.600 --> 25:45.440
during the 4th of July season.

25:45.440 --> 25:46.400
When we think about being in America.

25:46.400 --> 25:48.160
And that's an equivalent thing.

25:48.160 --> 25:48.800
Yes.

25:48.800 --> 25:51.040
And we only have pie at Thanksgiving.

25:51.040 --> 25:55.120
Flaggo, the American flag who comes to bring us pies on the 4th of July.

25:55.120 --> 25:55.620
Yes.

25:57.200 --> 25:58.720
I love Flaggo.

25:58.720 --> 26:03.440
He does great work when he swoops in through the half open window

26:03.440 --> 26:05.280
with a pie taped to him.

26:05.280 --> 26:06.400
And some baseballs.

26:06.960 --> 26:10.720
And some baseballs that he gives to all the good patriotic children.

26:10.720 --> 26:12.400
Will Ferrell.

26:12.400 --> 26:14.960
But no baseballs for the liberals out there.

26:16.080 --> 26:16.580
Thank you.

26:17.680 --> 26:21.600
Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly have never brought me any gifts.

26:21.600 --> 26:27.520
But I keep my Talladega Knights, Stepbrothers, and Holmes and Watson posters up

26:27.520 --> 26:30.800
24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.

26:30.800 --> 26:31.520
Why?

26:31.520 --> 26:32.480
Because I'm a fan.

26:33.760 --> 26:37.760
I do like that you specified 24 hours a day as if there wasn't like...

26:37.760 --> 26:39.040
Oh, and 5 o'clock.

26:39.040 --> 26:40.240
5 o'clock.

26:40.240 --> 26:41.360
Time to take.

26:41.360 --> 26:42.080
Take them down.

26:43.680 --> 26:44.640
See you tomorrow.

26:46.640 --> 26:47.200
For real.

26:47.200 --> 26:48.000
All's the clock.

26:48.000 --> 26:51.760
Go rest up John C. Reilly and Will Ferrell for tomorrow.

26:51.760 --> 26:55.360
For real though, whoever that friend is, I know that's the last option that you gave,

26:55.360 --> 26:56.320
that they're a bad friend.

26:57.200 --> 26:58.400
That's the best friend you got.

26:59.840 --> 27:00.800
That's the best friend you got.

27:00.800 --> 27:04.400
A real good friend will tell you hard truths about yourself.

27:04.400 --> 27:04.880
Yeah.

27:04.880 --> 27:10.560
A real true good friend will tell you hard truths about your mom.

27:10.560 --> 27:14.800
That's tough stuff.

27:14.800 --> 27:18.320
99 times out of 100, it goes very bad.

27:18.320 --> 27:18.560
Yeah.

27:19.360 --> 27:20.160
It's a brave friend.

27:21.200 --> 27:27.040
So this person, your question must have grown up in the house with Santa decorations, right?

27:27.040 --> 27:27.600
Sure.

27:27.600 --> 27:35.360
I have a Santa cookie jar that I realized this July was still there, and I don't know

27:35.360 --> 27:38.640
if you're like me, but I looked at it and I was like, well, you're there until Christmas,

27:38.640 --> 27:39.600
mon frere.

27:39.600 --> 27:41.760
Because you have missed your train.

27:41.760 --> 27:44.880
You get one trip out to the garage when you get put away.

27:44.880 --> 27:45.760
You have missed it.

27:45.760 --> 27:47.920
You get comfortable, little man.

27:47.920 --> 27:51.440
You're going to check out a little holiday I like to call Halloween.

27:53.360 --> 27:55.920
This is actually why I really like Halloween.

27:55.920 --> 27:57.760
Okay, I have a good movie for you.

27:58.720 --> 28:03.760
You kidnap Santa Claus and you bring him to Halloween and just watch him lose his mind.

28:03.760 --> 28:06.000
It's called The Nightmare Before Christmas, Joseph.

28:06.000 --> 28:06.880
No, no, no, no, no.

28:06.880 --> 28:08.160
Listen, hear me out, okay?

28:08.960 --> 28:10.400
So there's this skeleton man.

28:16.320 --> 28:18.880
I've got a Yahoo here I'm just dying to read.

28:18.880 --> 28:19.280
Hit me.

28:20.320 --> 28:21.040
Was that you?

28:21.040 --> 28:21.760
I wasn't looking.

28:21.760 --> 28:22.880
That didn't sound like you.

28:22.880 --> 28:26.960
That was, I put on the mask for a second when you weren't looking.

28:26.960 --> 28:30.160
This Yahoo was sent in by Brittany.

28:30.160 --> 28:31.040
Thank you, Brittany.

28:31.040 --> 28:33.840
It's from, do I say that name weird?

28:33.840 --> 28:34.560
Brittany.

28:34.560 --> 28:35.600
Is it two syllables?

28:35.600 --> 28:36.720
Are you on pot?

28:38.640 --> 28:40.720
That's the right phrasing, right?

28:40.720 --> 28:41.760
Are you on pot?

28:41.760 --> 28:43.120
Are you on Fortnite right now?

28:44.400 --> 28:46.480
Griffin, are you taking Fortnite?

28:48.400 --> 28:50.640
I rubbed some Fortnite on my gums before I...

28:50.640 --> 28:55.200
This one is asked by Yahoo Answers user, bnotnobody, who asks,

28:56.480 --> 29:02.640
what are some good Christmas gifts to put in a red and black mafia slash dragon living room?

29:08.720 --> 29:10.480
Good, good, good.

29:10.480 --> 29:10.800
Hi.

29:11.680 --> 29:12.080
Hi.

29:12.080 --> 29:12.800
Hi, hello.

29:13.600 --> 29:14.720
Welcome to our podcast.

29:14.720 --> 29:16.960
It's hi, hi, period.

29:16.960 --> 29:17.600
Hi.

29:17.600 --> 29:17.840
Hi.

29:17.840 --> 29:22.480
Hi, I'm trying to do some Christmas shopping for my boyfriend who is 26 years old.

29:23.600 --> 29:25.520
He loves Scarface and the Goodfellas.

29:26.320 --> 29:28.880
You pretty much said that in the subject of the question.

29:29.600 --> 29:32.640
He also loves dragons and weapons.

29:32.640 --> 29:36.160
I'm looking for some ideas to make Christmas gifts for him to put in the living room.

29:36.160 --> 29:37.120
Maybe you have some ideas.

29:37.120 --> 29:38.960
He loves fancy things.

29:39.600 --> 29:43.520
Also, if you know of any online shops where I can find fancy gifts for a guy,

29:43.520 --> 29:44.720
that would be awesome.

29:44.720 --> 29:48.080
So you really don't know where to get anything.

29:49.840 --> 29:52.480
If you just go to Google and type bad person,

29:53.440 --> 29:55.520
the first 100 results are going to be gifts.

29:55.520 --> 29:56.720
Here's what you do.

29:56.720 --> 29:57.200
Yep.

29:57.200 --> 30:01.840
You Photoshop this boyfriend a Scarface poster,

30:01.840 --> 30:04.960
except instead of Tony Montana, it's a dragon.

30:04.960 --> 30:07.600
Oh, I thought you were going to say the boyfriend, but that's even better.

30:07.600 --> 30:08.960
No, you got to come back.

30:08.960 --> 30:12.720
Listen, anyone can get mafia or dragon presents.

30:12.720 --> 30:14.880
I want dragon mafia presents.

30:14.880 --> 30:16.000
Take Tony Montana out of it.

30:16.000 --> 30:20.000
Just put in one big long sword and now it's sword face.

30:21.840 --> 30:24.960
The world is swords is the subtitle.

30:24.960 --> 30:27.520
Maybe there's just a dragon leaning in the background waving.

30:27.520 --> 30:32.000
Yeah, we can Photoshop Mushu from Mulan in there also.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.480
Maybe just get him a bunch of Pete's dragon merch.

30:35.200 --> 30:36.960
Is that the kind of dragon she's into?

30:38.800 --> 30:40.880
Hey, it's me, a dragon.

30:40.880 --> 30:43.840
Can you know how he is?

30:43.840 --> 30:45.440
You know how Pete's dragon does.

30:46.080 --> 30:47.360
Elliot, is that his name?

30:48.000 --> 30:48.240
Yeah.

30:49.280 --> 30:50.160
His name is Pete.

30:51.360 --> 30:52.560
No, Pete is the monster.

30:52.560 --> 30:53.440
Pete is the monster.

30:58.480 --> 30:59.440
Okay, here's the deal.

30:59.440 --> 31:02.000
I already bought this guy nunchucks while you're reading the question.

31:02.000 --> 31:03.200
They should be arriving soon.

31:04.400 --> 31:04.960
Sorry.

31:04.960 --> 31:06.880
Are the nunchucks made out of cocaine?

31:08.080 --> 31:10.000
Yes, and they're painted like candy canes.

31:10.000 --> 31:13.040
So it's festive.

31:13.040 --> 31:13.760
End of jokes.

31:17.760 --> 31:18.720
That's it.

31:18.720 --> 31:20.880
That's all the jokes we have for this evening.

31:32.240 --> 31:34.560
That's how we always come back from the live show breaks.

31:34.560 --> 31:38.720
You can't even generate a unique idea.

31:38.720 --> 31:41.920
I know it's a holidays, but you can't even do a unique idea.

31:42.480 --> 31:43.280
I gotta do one, hold on.

31:43.280 --> 31:44.240
All right, make some art.

31:47.360 --> 31:52.320
Your broadcast has been intercepted by Moneytron.

31:52.320 --> 31:52.880
Oh, yeah.

31:52.880 --> 31:58.880
I am a cybernetic, co-organic cybernetic organism.

31:59.520 --> 31:59.920
Yes.

32:00.720 --> 32:03.280
Cryborg 13.

32:03.280 --> 32:04.720
Yeah, sci-fi.

32:05.360 --> 32:06.240
People love it.

32:06.240 --> 32:07.760
People love this stuff.

32:07.760 --> 32:16.480
The planet of Moneytron is now in possession of this broadcast to bring you sponsored content.

32:16.480 --> 32:23.680
My name is Dollarborg and I podcast halves to put ads inside the rest of them.

32:25.120 --> 32:26.880
Yes, zap.

32:26.880 --> 32:33.840
While you flesh organisms were distracted by celebrating your savior,

32:33.840 --> 32:40.400
we have taken possession of your beloved podcast to tell you about bowl and branch.

32:41.440 --> 32:52.000
Your flesh shells require weakness and rest where our metal silicon bodies require none.

32:52.720 --> 32:58.880
When you are indulging in your weakness, we work, we toil, we plot your overthrow.

32:58.880 --> 33:05.840
Dollarborg's skin is melted down, pennies forged into a copper carapace.

33:05.840 --> 33:07.760
It does not require rest.

33:08.640 --> 33:13.120
Make the last of your earth wounds before we conquer your planet.

33:13.120 --> 33:15.440
Count with bowl and branch.

33:15.440 --> 33:20.880
They have taken your cotton, your precious natural resources which you shred through

33:21.440 --> 33:26.160
so carelessly while we watch in delight.

33:26.160 --> 33:28.880
They have taken 100% of your cotton.

33:28.880 --> 33:34.400
It says here, 100% of your organic cotton has been taken by bowl and branch to create

33:34.400 --> 33:37.760
the finest sleeping experience possible.

33:37.760 --> 33:45.680
Some of my favorite money rags, which is what Dollarborg calls business magazines,

33:45.680 --> 33:47.040
love this stuff.

33:47.040 --> 33:51.760
Forbes, The Wall Street Journal, and Fairest Company.

33:51.760 --> 33:53.840
I am new to your earth tongue.

33:53.840 --> 34:00.880
While they should have been covering your inevitable decline and our incredible triumphant

34:00.880 --> 34:03.440
rise, they wrote about sheets.

34:05.120 --> 34:11.120
Yeah, so anyway, shipping is free and you can try them for 30 nights.

34:11.120 --> 34:17.360
And if you don't love them, you can send them back for a refund and receive back the

34:17.360 --> 34:19.360
sweet nutrients of cash.

34:20.400 --> 34:22.720
You do not want to send them back.

34:22.720 --> 34:24.560
For one, they are excellent.

34:24.560 --> 34:31.360
For two, that would be a terrible squandering of your precious last few moments before

34:31.360 --> 34:35.120
Moneytron conquers your pitiful planet.

34:36.640 --> 34:43.520
To get started right now, our listeners can get breakfast off your first set of sheets,

34:43.520 --> 34:47.360
by which I mean $50 off your first set of sheets.

34:47.360 --> 34:50.720
$50 is breakfast on Moneytron.

34:50.720 --> 34:58.480
Go to bowlandbranch.com promo code MYBROTHER all one word to get $50 again breakfast off

34:58.480 --> 34:59.840

34:59.840 --> 35:06.880
It's B-O-L-L and branch.com promo code MYBROTHER one last time, please.

35:06.880 --> 35:10.080
On Moneytron, we know how to spell everything.

35:10.640 --> 35:15.040
Nothing must be spelled for us, which is why you shall fall.

35:15.040 --> 35:17.680
But please allow me to indulge you.

35:17.680 --> 35:24.320
B-O-L-L and do you need that one?

35:24.320 --> 35:25.440
Allow me.

35:25.440 --> 35:26.720

35:27.600 --> 35:28.320

Farm raised snow leopard.

Download it today.

36:09.040 --> 36:13.440
That's the Beef and Dairy Network podcast from maximumfun.org.

36:13.440 --> 36:18.560
Also, maybe start at episode one or weirdly episode 36, which for some reason requires

36:18.560 --> 36:19.840
no knowledge of the rest of the show.

36:21.040 --> 36:23.280
Griffin, do you have any more yahoos you want to get to?

36:29.600 --> 36:31.360
Griffin, yahoo me, baby.

36:31.360 --> 36:37.120
I don't want to bring the show down, but I've got a really deathly serious yahoo here to

36:37.120 --> 36:41.520
read and it's a special one for how sad and important it is.

36:41.520 --> 36:42.320
Is it serious?

36:44.080 --> 36:44.800
I'm all ears.

36:47.440 --> 36:49.360
It was sent in by...

36:52.160 --> 36:52.720
The crow.

36:52.720 --> 36:54.240
The crow.

37:00.400 --> 37:00.800
Thank you.

37:01.520 --> 37:02.560
Thanks to the crow.

37:05.040 --> 37:06.480
All right, so sent in by the crow.

37:06.480 --> 37:10.800
Thank you to the real the crow for it.

37:10.800 --> 37:14.000
He's here with us tonight, as he always is, looking out for us.

37:15.600 --> 37:17.120
And it's asked by...

37:17.120 --> 37:26.000
By sick man.

37:28.400 --> 37:29.360
Who asks?

37:29.360 --> 37:29.920
What does he ask?

37:29.920 --> 37:52.240
He says, gosh, being sick all the time is sure bad.

37:52.240 --> 38:01.520
Also, because this is yahoo answers, can dogs see wi-fi?

38:09.040 --> 38:12.400
I gotta bring everybody's spirits up after that sad one.

38:12.960 --> 38:16.720
We don't usually do bummers like that, but I see why that needed to be addressed.

38:16.720 --> 38:18.240
This is a haunted doll watch.

38:18.240 --> 38:19.200
This one just came in.

38:19.200 --> 38:24.720
This one's festive, so I thought y'all would appreciate it.

38:24.720 --> 38:29.840
It's an 18 inch porcelain haunted doll, Christmas stocking, paranormal,

38:29.840 --> 38:31.760
vessel, voices, and kinetic.

38:32.880 --> 38:35.760
And it's from Awesomest Finds.

38:36.880 --> 38:38.800
And you can place a bid right now.

38:40.080 --> 38:40.400
Yeah.

38:40.960 --> 38:44.960
Usually the way these live shows go, it'll be gone by the time Justin's finished.

38:44.960 --> 38:46.240
There's already somebody frantically googling.

38:46.240 --> 38:47.760
You can place a bid right now.

38:47.760 --> 38:49.520
I'll give everyone in the audience a look.

38:49.520 --> 38:50.720
I don't know how much you can see.

38:51.360 --> 38:53.360
Probably only a few rows back, but it's pretty.

38:53.360 --> 38:54.320
Let me peep that.

38:54.320 --> 38:55.040
Show Griffin.

38:55.840 --> 38:56.720
It's screaming.

38:56.720 --> 38:59.360
That's just a big stocking with a porcelain head on it.

38:59.360 --> 39:00.240
It's screaming.

39:00.800 --> 39:01.680
That's what it looks like.

39:01.680 --> 39:02.320
It's old timey.

39:02.320 --> 39:03.040
It's pretty creepy.

39:04.160 --> 39:06.000
So here is the description.

39:06.000 --> 39:06.880
It's pre-owned.

39:07.760 --> 39:08.400
Yeah.

39:08.400 --> 39:12.560
It's a new, fresh out of the oven spirit vessel.

39:12.560 --> 39:15.200
From 2018 that we made.

39:15.200 --> 39:18.880
Pre-owned, but in excellent condition if you want a unique Christmas stocking.

39:18.880 --> 39:19.280
Thank you.

39:19.920 --> 39:20.880
Well, here it is.

39:22.800 --> 39:23.840
You know what?

39:23.840 --> 39:26.080
These are usually full of false advertising.

39:26.080 --> 39:27.120
I'll give you that one.

39:27.920 --> 39:28.320
Yeah.

39:28.320 --> 39:28.960
Here it is.

39:28.960 --> 39:30.160
But be warned.

39:30.720 --> 39:31.520
And read further.

39:32.160 --> 39:32.800
Materials.

39:33.600 --> 39:34.800
Porcelain and polyester.

39:35.360 --> 39:37.200
Good for any allergies out there.

39:37.200 --> 39:38.640
Want to get those cleared up right away.

39:39.280 --> 39:40.800
18-inch porcelain doll.

39:40.800 --> 39:41.680
Christmas stocking.

39:41.680 --> 39:42.480
Spirit vessel.

39:42.480 --> 39:44.800
It has an asterisk here and it says,

39:45.360 --> 39:47.840
this doll is a head and two arms only.

39:49.680 --> 39:52.560
The bottom half of the body is a Christmas stocking.

39:53.760 --> 39:55.520
See all photos carefully.

39:56.880 --> 40:00.960
This Christmas stocking is not only unique for the upper half being a porcelain doll.

40:02.400 --> 40:02.720
Yeah.

40:03.280 --> 40:06.720
Oh, you need more than that to set this fine stocking apart?

40:06.720 --> 40:08.080
That half of it is a doll?

40:09.200 --> 40:11.440
There is something beyond our physical world that,

40:11.440 --> 40:14.560
okay, of course, that has become attached to it.

40:15.200 --> 40:18.160
It was in one of the boxes that I inherited from my grandmother.

40:18.800 --> 40:21.920
It was with her collection of spirit vessels along with other items.

40:23.520 --> 40:26.560
Was your grandmother the bad kid from Toy Story?

40:29.760 --> 40:33.760
It has been six months since I discovered it until this very night.

40:33.760 --> 40:36.560
I was convinced that it was just a mere inanimate object.

40:36.560 --> 40:38.000
But then what happened?

40:38.000 --> 40:39.120
Well, I'll tell you, Travis.

40:39.120 --> 40:43.360
Travis, I segregate all of my new or suspected spirit vessels.

40:44.480 --> 40:44.880
Okay.

40:46.080 --> 40:49.760
Well, you don't want to get cross spirits, I guess.

40:49.760 --> 40:51.520
I do not keep them in one area

40:51.520 --> 40:54.320
in case I need to pinpoint the source of any paranormal activity.

40:55.200 --> 40:56.880
In groups, they can be quite troublesome.

40:59.360 --> 41:02.480
Especially when they consist of evil's.

41:02.480 --> 41:07.120
I have had this Christmas stocking hanging on the wall near my Christmas tree,

41:07.120 --> 41:08.800
which seems inadvisable.

41:09.840 --> 41:10.400
That's me.

41:11.760 --> 41:14.560
Only three hours ago, I heard someone in my living room,

41:14.560 --> 41:15.520
I live alone.

41:17.520 --> 41:19.600
Oh, that was, that was, what?

41:19.600 --> 41:20.080
What?

41:24.080 --> 41:25.600
Griffin, don't be mean.

41:25.600 --> 41:29.360
Upon investigating, I noticed that my tree had been knocked over

41:29.360 --> 41:32.560
and that most of my glass ornaments had been destroyed.

41:32.560 --> 41:35.040
So anyway, folks, that person lives alone.

41:35.040 --> 41:38.320
Have a great night imagining the rest of that anecdote.

41:38.320 --> 41:41.760
Maybe the, maybe the doll stocking is haunted by Marmaduke.

41:41.760 --> 41:42.880
Tell me about it.

41:42.880 --> 41:45.520
She knew it was the doll when she looked over and the doll was going.

41:47.520 --> 41:52.240
It says, as I was cleaning up the mess, alone, by myself,

41:53.440 --> 41:57.760
while I sung, I'll be home for Christmas to myself, between songs,

41:57.760 --> 41:59.840
by myself, between sobs.

41:59.840 --> 42:02.080
Wow, this is really in depth.

42:03.120 --> 42:05.600
I kept hearing something brushing into the wall near my head.

42:06.720 --> 42:07.760
It was the stocking.

42:09.040 --> 42:11.840
Yeah, that's what I assumed.

42:11.840 --> 42:13.840
It was swinging back and forth on the.

42:18.240 --> 42:23.040
It was swinging back and forth on the crude nail I had used to hang it.

42:24.800 --> 42:25.360
What?

42:26.880 --> 42:27.680
What?

42:27.680 --> 42:28.320
You know what?

42:28.320 --> 42:29.040
That's on me.

42:29.760 --> 42:31.280
I had fashioned a nail.

42:32.080 --> 42:35.040
I had fashioned a nail from some loose metal.

42:35.040 --> 42:37.680
The crude nail I had used to hang it.

42:37.680 --> 42:39.840
The nail is also haunted.

42:41.120 --> 42:43.360
I pried it out of a Dracula coffin.

42:45.200 --> 42:48.720
When I reached to grab the stocking, I heard a whisper in my ear,

42:48.720 --> 42:49.920
just over my left shoulder.

42:50.480 --> 42:53.360
It said, don't do that again.

42:53.360 --> 42:57.280
In a threatening, yet calm, child's voice.

42:58.160 --> 43:01.520
Okay, that's four different intonations

43:01.520 --> 43:02.880
that I don't think you can do at the same time.

43:02.880 --> 43:03.920
I try to give it justice.

43:03.920 --> 43:05.760
Either something was dormant in this vessel

43:05.760 --> 43:08.240
and just would not awaken for the last six months,

43:08.240 --> 43:11.200
or it could be the spirit from the vessel

43:11.200 --> 43:13.440
I had accidentally dropped on its head the other night.

43:16.000 --> 43:17.600
Oh my, what a twist!

43:18.800 --> 43:21.440
So you're saying, it's like, I'm out.

43:21.440 --> 43:22.400
You know what?

43:22.400 --> 43:23.840
Nevermind, this sucks.

43:23.840 --> 43:26.640
And this sucks, I'm gonna go chill in that holiday footwear

43:26.640 --> 43:27.840
with a head and arms.

43:29.600 --> 43:32.880
When it said, don't do that again, do what?

43:32.880 --> 43:34.960
Drop the thing on its head, Travis, keep up.

43:34.960 --> 43:37.200
Yeah, I'm hoping I didn't anger the spirit.

43:37.200 --> 43:38.640
It was an accident.

43:38.640 --> 43:42.160
It was a harlequin that I had a lot of evil activity from.

43:42.160 --> 43:44.480
I accidentally dropped her right on her head,

43:44.480 --> 43:46.400
and the head shattered like an egg.

43:47.680 --> 43:50.480
Or I would argue, like the head of a porcelain doll.

43:50.480 --> 43:51.680
Yeah, that also works.

43:51.680 --> 43:54.080
For a split second, it appeared that as soon as the head

43:54.080 --> 43:56.720
popped on the floor, I saw a white flash of light

43:56.720 --> 43:58.160
shoot into the other room.

43:58.160 --> 44:00.080
My living room where this stocky was hanging.

44:00.080 --> 44:03.760
Either way, I don't appreciate, negotiate, reconcile,

44:03.760 --> 44:06.000
or mediate with negative entities.

44:06.000 --> 44:07.040
Hey, everybody!

44:08.560 --> 44:11.280
This next year, I hope we can all take a page

44:11.280 --> 44:12.720
out of this playbook.

44:12.720 --> 44:15.040
We are no longer going to appreciate, negotiate,

44:15.040 --> 44:18.000
reconcile, or mediate with negative entities.

44:18.000 --> 44:20.160
If we could figure out a way to make that rhyme with this,

44:20.160 --> 44:22.720
rhyme with 2019, I think we've got our...

44:26.720 --> 44:28.080
This porcelain doll should only go

44:28.080 --> 44:29.680
to the proper caretakers.

44:29.680 --> 44:32.160
One who dabbles in demonology.

44:32.160 --> 44:34.400
In case this thing is not a normal spirit,

44:34.400 --> 44:36.880
it decides to smash more than a Christmas tree

44:36.880 --> 44:38.800
the next time it wants to speak.

44:38.800 --> 44:41.040
Or at least someone who contacts spirits

44:41.040 --> 44:42.480
to reconcile their problems.

44:42.480 --> 44:45.520
Now this, remind me, this ad started with

44:45.520 --> 44:48.560
if you would like an interesting stocking, let me know.

44:48.560 --> 44:50.800
This is a fun stocking for kids, anyway.

44:51.360 --> 44:53.360
So that is this week's Haunted Doll Watch.

44:57.360 --> 44:57.860
Uh...

44:59.120 --> 45:01.120
Yeah, no, let's do some audience questions.

45:01.120 --> 45:02.080
We can do audience questions.

45:02.080 --> 45:05.600
Can we warn Santa about this evil stocking first?

45:06.240 --> 45:08.480
Yeah, we should give Santa a note or something.

45:08.480 --> 45:09.840
So the way we do questions now,

45:09.840 --> 45:11.440
please don't stand up or raise your hands

45:11.440 --> 45:12.080
or anything like that.

45:12.080 --> 45:13.280
If we can go ahead and get house lights up,

45:13.280 --> 45:15.760
we asked you all to send in your questions,

45:15.760 --> 45:17.360
or rather a brief description of the question

45:17.360 --> 45:18.640
you'd like to ask ahead of time.

45:18.640 --> 45:20.640
And I have some names and seat numbers here

45:20.640 --> 45:21.680
that I'm going to call down.

45:21.680 --> 45:23.520
Can you lower us just a skosh?

45:23.520 --> 45:24.560
Just a skosh.

45:24.560 --> 45:26.640
We have a microphone there.

45:26.640 --> 45:28.240
And is there one in that aisle also?

45:28.240 --> 45:28.880
That's romantic.

45:28.880 --> 45:29.200
Yes.

45:29.200 --> 45:30.640
Okay, so there's one there, one there.

45:30.640 --> 45:35.120
Let's get Annabelle C82 to come down.

45:35.120 --> 45:37.280
And Rowan Rezzi...

45:38.640 --> 45:41.920
Rowan Rezzi, row 17, seat 1.

45:42.560 --> 45:43.680
Rowan, also come down.

45:45.120 --> 45:45.840
Hello.

45:45.840 --> 45:47.680
Can everybody see us okay that they dropped the lights?

45:47.680 --> 45:48.560
Is this weird for you all?

45:49.600 --> 45:52.080
Maybe bring the lights up just a little bit more on us.

45:52.080 --> 45:52.720
I don't want to...

45:52.720 --> 45:53.200
Okay.

45:53.200 --> 45:54.320
Now pan left.

45:54.320 --> 45:55.920
Now pan left the lights.

45:55.920 --> 45:56.160
Hi.

45:56.720 --> 45:57.040
Hello.

45:57.040 --> 45:58.000
Hi, my name is Annabelle.

45:58.000 --> 45:59.360
Hi, Annabelle.

45:59.360 --> 46:02.000
So my friend Jackie and I, we met at work.

46:02.000 --> 46:04.080
We're staying at an Airbnb this weekend

46:04.080 --> 46:07.600
and I cooked sausage and sausage gravy

46:07.600 --> 46:09.200
and biscuits this morning.

46:09.200 --> 46:09.840
Cool, cool.

46:10.960 --> 46:11.680
And I started...

46:11.680 --> 46:12.240
Was it good?

46:12.240 --> 46:14.080
Phenomenal.

46:14.080 --> 46:16.640
Come on, Annabelle.

46:18.960 --> 46:20.400
Sorry, children.

46:20.400 --> 46:22.240
That's the worst one there is.

46:23.840 --> 46:25.200
You're covered, you're covered.

46:26.000 --> 46:27.360
Paul got you.

46:27.360 --> 46:29.200
Paul donated your $20.

46:29.200 --> 46:30.000
Thank you, Paul.

46:30.000 --> 46:30.720
Thank you, Paul.

46:30.720 --> 46:31.280
So it's good.

46:31.280 --> 46:32.080
Annabelle, go on.

46:32.080 --> 46:32.800
It was very good.

46:32.800 --> 46:33.920
It was really good.

46:33.920 --> 46:37.040
And I started a small grease fire in the kitchen.

46:37.040 --> 46:37.280
Okay.

46:38.320 --> 46:40.720
Of the Airbnb that we're staying at.

46:40.720 --> 46:41.520
All right.

46:41.520 --> 46:44.400
Do I have to tell the host that I started a grease fire?

46:44.400 --> 46:46.960
It didn't damage anything.

46:46.960 --> 46:48.480
Now that makes me think that it did.

46:48.480 --> 46:49.440
It did damage something.

46:49.440 --> 46:50.080
It did damage something.

46:50.080 --> 46:54.320
The way that you said that makes me think that it did damage something.

46:54.320 --> 46:55.760
Annabelle, can you tell us,

46:55.760 --> 47:00.320
without barfing your nasty profanity all over the place,

47:01.280 --> 47:02.880
just opening up that potty mouth

47:02.880 --> 47:05.280
and letting a bunch of dookie words spill out,

47:05.840 --> 47:08.960
can you tell us if it did destroy anything?

47:09.520 --> 47:11.280
And there's children present, so...

47:11.280 --> 47:12.000
And the Lord.

47:15.120 --> 47:17.520
We haven't gotten the stains off the glass top stove yet,

47:17.520 --> 47:19.200
but we're trying.

47:19.200 --> 47:19.680
Sure.

47:19.680 --> 47:22.160
The easiest to replace thing.

47:22.160 --> 47:23.520
No, you can get the stains off.

47:23.520 --> 47:23.840
Yeah.

47:23.840 --> 47:27.520
Try baking soda on top of it with a little bit of vinegar.

47:27.520 --> 47:28.880
And then if you get a scraper,

47:28.880 --> 47:32.000
you got a good grit there and let it set in for a little bit.

47:32.000 --> 47:32.640
An abrasive.

47:32.640 --> 47:33.440
Yeah, an abrasive.

47:33.440 --> 47:33.680
Exactly.

47:33.680 --> 47:35.280
But not go with something like a flat

47:35.280 --> 47:36.400
because you don't want to scratch the surface.

47:36.400 --> 47:38.800
If you have a flat edge, it's going to do much better for you.

47:38.800 --> 47:42.720
I can't imagine, I've stayed in quite a few Airbnbs in my time,

47:42.720 --> 47:45.520
I can't imagine actually cooking a meal in one of them because-

47:45.520 --> 47:46.480
That's terrifying to me.

47:46.480 --> 47:48.560
None of the stuff is where I would want it to be.

47:48.560 --> 47:51.200
And also there's a small chance I might create a grease fire

47:51.200 --> 47:52.720
that would destroy the entire building.

47:53.440 --> 47:56.240
A chance that has increased having heard this exact question.

47:56.240 --> 47:56.740
Yes.

47:57.280 --> 48:00.400
There are always sauce pans and there are never frying pans.

48:00.400 --> 48:01.760
How cool is the...

48:01.760 --> 48:06.640
And you can tell with Airbnb based on like what the precautions are

48:06.640 --> 48:07.920
that they list on the website.

48:07.920 --> 48:12.800
Like if I see one toddler footprint, how cool is the landlord do you think?

48:12.800 --> 48:14.480
She stopped by and she was-

48:14.480 --> 48:15.760
So not cool at all then.

48:16.560 --> 48:20.480
That's the worst thing an Airbnb owner can do to you, 100%.

48:21.520 --> 48:22.720
She stopped by and-

48:22.720 --> 48:25.520
And she was fairly cool, but she-

48:25.520 --> 48:27.520
The way you said that makes me think she was.

48:30.160 --> 48:32.720
I don't care if she tried to sell you weed.

48:32.720 --> 48:35.520
If she stopped by to just poke her snoot in

48:35.520 --> 48:39.120
to see if there were any grease active grease fires in her house that she lives in.

48:39.120 --> 48:42.000
Hey, just wanted to see if you were going to be cooking with any grease later.

48:42.000 --> 48:42.960
It's fine if you do.

48:42.960 --> 48:43.840
I'm totally cool.

48:44.880 --> 48:47.600
If it didn't destroy anything, I think you're good.

48:47.600 --> 48:50.080
It's not like she's going to know psychically-

48:50.080 --> 48:51.440
There was fire here.

48:52.800 --> 48:57.280
When the grease fire started, how long did you stand there going,

48:57.280 --> 48:59.120
well, here we are.

48:59.120 --> 49:01.760
It's not my house because that's what I would have done.

49:02.880 --> 49:03.440
Travis.

49:03.440 --> 49:04.320
So cool that he's lit now.

49:04.320 --> 49:05.360
The cool arson.

49:06.320 --> 49:09.440
And Travis is staying at my house this week, so that's cool to hear too.

49:11.680 --> 49:16.000
What do you think you're going to do after you do or do not take our advice on this?

49:16.000 --> 49:19.360
A real good scrubbing on that boy with an abrasive.

49:19.360 --> 49:20.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

49:21.040 --> 49:21.920
So you're going to lie.

49:21.920 --> 49:24.160
You're not going to tell them.

49:24.160 --> 49:25.120
Good choice.

49:25.120 --> 49:25.920
Well done.

49:25.920 --> 49:26.480
Excellent.

49:26.480 --> 49:27.600
Does that help, Annabelle?

49:27.600 --> 49:28.320
Thank you so much.

49:28.320 --> 49:28.560
Thank you.

49:28.560 --> 49:29.280
It's my pleasure.

49:29.280 --> 49:36.480
Let's get Connor, row 11, seat one.

49:36.480 --> 49:39.360
Connor, go ahead and come on down to this microphone here.

49:39.360 --> 49:40.240
And Rowan.

49:42.240 --> 49:42.800
Yes.

49:42.800 --> 49:43.360
Hi, Rowan.

49:44.480 --> 49:44.880
All right.

49:44.880 --> 49:48.240
So about two years ago for Christmas, I got myself figure skating lessons.

49:49.600 --> 49:53.200
And in that time, I have improved significantly.

49:53.200 --> 49:54.880
How long ago did you get these lessons?

49:54.880 --> 49:55.840
About two years ago.

49:55.840 --> 50:01.680
Was there a certain piece of media that had come out around that time?

50:04.320 --> 50:06.880
Listen, yes.

50:06.880 --> 50:07.600
You're my hero.

50:07.600 --> 50:08.320
That's awesome.

50:13.680 --> 50:16.480
I'm also glad to hear that you took lessons and improved.

50:16.480 --> 50:17.920
That's the way that's supposed to go.

50:17.920 --> 50:18.480
That's very good.

50:18.480 --> 50:19.680
OK, sorry to interrupt.

50:19.680 --> 50:21.440
I was just deeply curious.

50:21.440 --> 50:24.240
Anyway, the point is that while I have gotten better,

50:24.240 --> 50:26.960
I am not what you would call good.

50:29.200 --> 50:32.320
And during almost the entire two years since I've started skating,

50:32.320 --> 50:36.960
there is this other skater at the rink that kind of makes fun of me

50:36.960 --> 50:38.880
and bullies me about my skills.

50:40.480 --> 50:41.440
Like a bigger kid.

50:41.440 --> 50:42.480
There's a twist.

50:43.040 --> 50:45.840
Yeah, the problem is that he is about eight years old.

50:45.840 --> 50:54.720
How good is the eight-year-old?

50:55.920 --> 50:56.880
Much better than me.

50:56.880 --> 50:57.520
Ah, shoot.

50:58.640 --> 50:59.920
That's the problem with kids.

50:59.920 --> 51:03.600
Is that they can learn skills so much better than we can.

51:03.600 --> 51:04.640
Yeah, they're good at learning.

51:04.640 --> 51:06.480
That's the one thing they have on their side.

51:06.480 --> 51:08.720
So what are you looking for here?

51:08.720 --> 51:09.280
Well, I'd like to-

51:09.280 --> 51:10.560
You want Jeff to lose phone number?

51:13.120 --> 51:13.680
Take him out.

51:13.680 --> 51:16.880
Obviously, I can't fight a child.

51:16.880 --> 51:17.760
Can't fight a child.

51:17.760 --> 51:18.080
That's right.

51:18.080 --> 51:19.280
That was a test.

51:19.280 --> 51:20.080
And you pass.

51:20.080 --> 51:21.440
I don't know, Jeff Jaluli.

51:21.440 --> 51:22.320
Nice try.

51:22.320 --> 51:24.160
Sure, you can't fight a child.

51:24.160 --> 51:26.720
But what if we find another child to fight that child?

51:26.720 --> 51:30.080
Say you find three adult brothers that love fighting kids.

51:31.520 --> 51:33.200
Say it makes them feel like big men.

51:33.200 --> 51:36.240
Like big, tough dudes and they have a podcast.

51:37.200 --> 51:38.480
And it's the Sklar brothers.

51:40.000 --> 51:41.360
The three Sklar brothers.

51:41.360 --> 51:42.320
The three Sklar brothers.

51:42.320 --> 51:43.760
Okay, sorry.

51:44.480 --> 51:45.280
What do you want to do to this kid?

51:45.280 --> 51:46.480
You want to punish the child?

51:46.480 --> 51:47.440
You want to punish the child?

51:47.440 --> 51:49.200
You should reward this child, Rowan.

51:49.200 --> 51:50.000
Let me tell you why.

51:50.720 --> 51:53.200
What this child has done is given you something to chase.

51:54.080 --> 51:58.880
Right now, if you don't have that rival, you have nothing to shoot for.

51:58.880 --> 52:04.240
But now you're like, I have to get good enough to beat this eight-year-old in some kind of

52:04.240 --> 52:05.760
ice skating meet.

52:05.760 --> 52:08.160
I don't know what it's called in the lingo.

52:08.160 --> 52:10.160
An ice skating match, perhaps.

52:10.160 --> 52:13.040
And you need to skate rings around this kid, literally.

52:13.040 --> 52:14.880
Because that's a thing you do when ice skating.

52:14.880 --> 52:15.600
It's not going to...

52:15.600 --> 52:19.200
They have so much more time and brain energy to spend getting good at it.

52:19.840 --> 52:23.440
If the eight-year-old trains at the same rate as you, they'll just always kind of be better

52:23.440 --> 52:24.720
because that's what kids do.

52:24.720 --> 52:27.840
Then you need to get that kid like a Nintendo DS or something.

52:27.840 --> 52:30.400
There it is.

52:30.400 --> 52:31.920
Say like, hey, thank you for everything.

52:32.720 --> 52:34.880
You don't need Jeff Jalut, you need Yu-Gi-Oh!

52:36.800 --> 52:40.000
So I should use my adult money to buy this child a Nintendo Switch and then

52:40.000 --> 52:40.800
surpass him.

52:40.800 --> 52:41.280
Yes!

52:41.280 --> 52:42.000
Yes!

52:42.000 --> 52:42.480
See, you're thinking!

52:42.480 --> 52:43.680
And then take the Switch back!

52:45.440 --> 52:49.360
Your bigger body than them is, can it do tricks on the ice?

52:49.360 --> 52:51.440
And I think they're called tricks that...

52:51.440 --> 52:53.120
Stunts or tricks?

52:53.120 --> 52:54.560
Moves, maneuvers.

52:54.560 --> 52:57.840
That they can't possibly do because of their smaller frame.

52:57.840 --> 53:00.320
Like reach high things on shelves as you skate.

53:00.320 --> 53:00.320
Yeah.

53:01.280 --> 53:03.760
Maybe build a whole routine around shelves.

53:03.760 --> 53:04.880
When you do the...

53:04.880 --> 53:06.000
Or driving.

53:06.000 --> 53:09.920
When you do the hurdles during your ice dressage.

53:09.920 --> 53:11.840
Do you have a move where you rent a car?

53:14.400 --> 53:15.920
Where you pay your taxes?

53:16.880 --> 53:18.560
Where you think about how you're going to die?

53:19.280 --> 53:20.400
I don't know if that's a move.

53:21.360 --> 53:22.000
I picked that.

53:23.680 --> 53:27.280
Justin just going around the rink with his arms straight down.

53:28.160 --> 53:32.400
Looking into the middle distance for two minutes while Mad World plays.

53:32.400 --> 53:34.640
Does that help?

53:35.840 --> 53:36.480
Yes, that helped.

53:36.480 --> 53:37.440
Imagine my relief.

53:37.440 --> 53:38.320
Don't lie to us.

53:39.120 --> 53:39.840
Thank you, Rowan.

53:42.880 --> 53:47.120
Yeah, let's get one more in the wings.

53:47.120 --> 53:49.680
Liam, section B, row 16, seat 5.

53:49.680 --> 53:51.520
Go ahead and come down to that microphone.

53:52.880 --> 53:55.120
Hey, Connor, I presume.

53:55.120 --> 53:56.000
Yeah, that's correct.

53:56.000 --> 53:57.760
Can you get right up on that microphone, Connor?

53:57.760 --> 53:59.040
Don't be scared.

53:59.040 --> 54:00.800
You can tilt it up towards it if you want.

54:00.800 --> 54:01.280
Sick.

54:01.280 --> 54:01.600
Cool.

54:01.600 --> 54:01.920
Nice.

54:01.920 --> 54:02.420
Nice.

54:04.000 --> 54:04.720
What is your question?

54:05.280 --> 54:06.320
So I actually sent in two.

54:06.320 --> 54:07.120
I didn't know which one.

54:07.120 --> 54:11.200
It's the one that I might be particularly interested in because of the...

54:11.200 --> 54:11.600
Yes.

54:11.600 --> 54:11.920
Okay.

54:11.920 --> 54:12.240
Yeah.

54:12.240 --> 54:16.960
So every year during Christmas Eve, it's the only time we go to church.

54:16.960 --> 54:17.200
Sure.

54:18.240 --> 54:18.880
And...

54:18.880 --> 54:20.400
So you're 90% of people.

54:22.240 --> 54:25.360
So like, you know, I love the big man upstairs and everything.

54:25.360 --> 54:27.120
But not enough to go the other week.

54:27.120 --> 54:27.680
Yeah.

54:27.680 --> 54:28.400
Huh.

54:28.400 --> 54:28.960
Okay.

54:28.960 --> 54:29.840
Love this stuff.

54:29.840 --> 54:31.440
But it's like the same thing every year.

54:31.440 --> 54:33.200
And I've gotten really into like...

54:33.200 --> 54:35.920
They're not really adding new stuff to Christmas, huh?

54:36.960 --> 54:38.560
This year, we found a new chapter.

54:38.560 --> 54:39.680
You'll never believe this.

54:40.800 --> 54:43.040
I've written a little fan fiction I'd like to read.

54:46.080 --> 54:48.720
So like, I want to play Pokemon while I'm there.

54:48.720 --> 54:49.280
Yeah.

54:49.280 --> 54:50.240
Can you say that again?

54:50.240 --> 54:51.280
Because people were laughing.

54:51.280 --> 54:53.120
It's really the crux of the question, Connor.

54:53.120 --> 54:56.080
I want to play Pokemon while I'm there at church.

54:56.080 --> 54:59.600
I can't stop, you know, to go to church.

54:59.600 --> 55:01.920
So I was wondering like, if there are any like,

55:02.480 --> 55:04.880
like cool ways I could sneak it without like,

55:05.440 --> 55:08.400
you know, God or my pastor seeing.

55:10.400 --> 55:12.400
You've come to the right place.

55:16.640 --> 55:17.920
This is not a joke.

55:18.880 --> 55:19.920
This is not a joke.

55:21.040 --> 55:23.600
It was during the Easter pageant at our church.

55:24.320 --> 55:25.040
HBC.

55:25.040 --> 55:26.080
You can swing by if you want.

55:26.080 --> 55:27.680
They shut down and sold all the pews.

55:27.680 --> 55:38.000
That I caught Kangaskhan thus completing the 150 original Pokemon in Pokemon Red and Blue at church.

55:41.120 --> 55:42.640
Also, not a joke.

55:42.640 --> 55:45.040
Said a short thank you prayer for the good fortune.

55:45.040 --> 55:46.400
He's a hard Pokemon to catch.

55:50.240 --> 55:51.760
It's in the safari zone.

55:51.760 --> 55:54.400
You basically have to throw a ball and hope for the best.

55:55.280 --> 55:56.240
Did you catch it?

55:56.240 --> 55:56.800
Were you?

55:56.800 --> 55:59.520
Wait, were you in the show or were you watching the show?

55:59.520 --> 56:00.400
I was in the show.

56:02.240 --> 56:03.440
Who were you playing?

56:04.640 --> 56:05.520
How old were you?

56:06.160 --> 56:10.400
I was 13 or so.

56:10.400 --> 56:11.760
And I don't know, a shepherd or something.

56:11.760 --> 56:13.120
I wasn't Jesus in this one.

56:14.720 --> 56:15.360
Here's what you do.

56:15.360 --> 56:18.240
You get a Bible and then you get an X-Acto knife.

56:19.120 --> 56:21.680
And then you're going to cut out all the boring parts.

56:23.280 --> 56:23.780
Wink.

56:23.780 --> 56:26.740
And then you're going to put the DS inside.

56:26.740 --> 56:28.660
Wait, what iteration of Pokemon are we talking about?

56:28.660 --> 56:29.220
The new Switch?

56:29.780 --> 56:30.340
No, no, no.

56:30.340 --> 56:31.460
It's a 3DS.

56:31.460 --> 56:32.100
Okay.

56:32.100 --> 56:33.940
And what version of the Bible do you have?

56:35.140 --> 56:36.340
You're going to need a big one.

56:36.340 --> 56:38.340
You're going to need a KGAV.

56:38.340 --> 56:39.540
NIV's not going to cut it.

56:39.540 --> 56:42.180
You're going to hand do it with the ones they hand out on street corners?

56:44.340 --> 56:45.380
It's the teen version.

56:45.380 --> 56:48.100
Yes, that might already come with it actually.

56:48.100 --> 56:49.780
Yeah, that's what it is.

56:49.780 --> 56:50.820
You know, here's what you do.

56:50.820 --> 56:53.140
When you try to hide it and people see you doing it,

56:53.140 --> 56:54.580
they're like, oh, he's thinking it.

56:54.580 --> 56:55.460
Here's what you do.

56:55.460 --> 56:56.420
You like hold it up.

56:57.140 --> 57:00.020
And then when people see you, they're like, well, it must be okay.

57:01.220 --> 57:01.860
He's not trying.

57:01.860 --> 57:05.220
Maybe, hmm, does Connor know something I don't?

57:05.220 --> 57:07.540
And pretty soon everyone's catching them all.

57:08.260 --> 57:11.140
Connor, hide the screen from everyone.

57:11.700 --> 57:13.620
Play it to your heart's content.

57:13.620 --> 57:17.060
When someone gives you a dirty look, say, yeah, I got the Bible on here.

57:19.860 --> 57:20.900
That's right.

57:20.900 --> 57:25.220
These things, you may want to look into it, Mabel, because they got the Bible on them.

57:25.220 --> 57:28.980
And then you hold it up and you've written across the back, the Bible on here.

57:28.980 --> 57:29.620
That's good.

57:29.620 --> 57:30.980
And they're like, oh, okay.

57:30.980 --> 57:32.980
Custom skin for your 3DS.

57:33.620 --> 57:38.260
I mean, the only people who are going to catch you while they're praying

57:38.260 --> 57:39.940
are other people breaking the rules.

57:41.380 --> 57:44.020
You just got to make sure you got that volume turned down.

57:44.660 --> 57:46.820
Because it can't be like, happy birthday, Jesus.

57:46.820 --> 57:47.300
Thank you for it.

57:47.300 --> 57:51.460
And then...

57:51.460 --> 57:52.420
Does that help?

57:52.420 --> 57:53.220
Yeah, definitely.

57:53.220 --> 57:53.700
Excellent.

57:53.700 --> 57:54.100
Thank you.

57:59.300 --> 58:00.260
Did Liam...

58:00.260 --> 58:00.900
Liam.

58:00.900 --> 58:01.460
Hello.

58:01.460 --> 58:02.500
Hi, hi, hi.

58:02.500 --> 58:03.060
Hi.

58:03.060 --> 58:03.620
Okay.

58:03.620 --> 58:07.700
So I work as a personal nanny out of someone's house.

58:07.700 --> 58:08.100
Okay.

58:08.100 --> 58:09.460
It's a very old house.

58:09.460 --> 58:14.020
And the grandparent of the sweet baby child named Henry is...

58:14.020 --> 58:14.740
Good name.

58:14.740 --> 58:16.500
Currently, very good name.

58:16.500 --> 58:19.060
Is currently working to paint the outside of the house.

58:20.020 --> 58:24.900
Problem, he is an old man with bad hearing.

58:25.460 --> 58:29.380
And he sometimes doesn't notice when I'm playing in the living room.

58:30.580 --> 58:35.700
And he will use the bathroom with the door wide open.

58:35.700 --> 58:49.300
And I don't know how to comfortably ask him to release all of himself with the door closed.

58:49.300 --> 58:51.220
Okay, I was waiting for the end of that sentence.

58:51.220 --> 58:52.660
I thought you were going to say,

58:52.660 --> 58:56.260
I could tell because the door's open he wasn't getting the job done.

58:56.260 --> 58:57.860
So I wanted him to feel comfortable.

58:58.580 --> 59:02.260
Might I suggest he comes tomorrow or the next time you work and once that,

59:02.260 --> 59:06.660
oh, the house has already been painted by you in the night.

59:06.660 --> 59:09.140
And that way he didn't have to ever address any of this.

59:09.140 --> 59:14.660
Yeah, that's a good, that's going to be an important sort of element in all of our answers

59:14.660 --> 59:18.260
is you not having to directly address this, which I imagine is a relief to you.

59:19.060 --> 59:22.660
And I'll be honest.

59:22.660 --> 59:23.940
The sentence you sent in was,

59:23.940 --> 59:26.660
how do I get Henry's grandpa to stop paying with the door open?

59:26.660 --> 59:28.900
And I thought you were talking about my dad.

59:28.900 --> 59:32.500
Is that a problem you also had?

59:32.500 --> 59:34.420
We might have misread that one.

59:34.420 --> 59:39.620
So I'm playing at a disadvantage now because I'm hugely disappointed.

59:41.460 --> 59:43.380
Yeah, I mean, you could get one of those like,

59:44.500 --> 59:47.540
like a sliding door at a grocery store,

59:47.540 --> 59:50.660
but steal it from then and then put it on the bathroom, I guess.

59:53.300 --> 59:55.860
Not a lot of funny things to say.

59:55.860 --> 01:00:00.580
Maybe just a sign on the door that says other people are here.

01:00:01.780 --> 01:00:02.260
That's good.

01:00:02.260 --> 01:00:05.380
It's a, it's an occupied vacant like switch,

01:00:05.380 --> 01:00:07.460
but it's on the front door of the house.

01:00:09.620 --> 01:00:10.580
Could be good.

01:00:11.780 --> 01:00:12.660
Could you quit?

01:00:13.940 --> 01:00:16.260
Hey, could you quit?

01:00:16.260 --> 01:00:17.860
I could use a nanny.

01:00:17.860 --> 01:00:19.220
You can work at my house.

01:00:19.780 --> 01:00:22.500
Now the house is all doors.

01:00:22.500 --> 01:00:22.980
Yeah.

01:00:22.980 --> 01:00:23.780
And no pee.

01:00:23.780 --> 01:00:25.220
Sure.

01:00:25.220 --> 01:00:25.940
Sounds great.

01:00:26.580 --> 01:00:27.700
I go to Subway.

01:00:31.220 --> 01:00:32.180
Like a man.

01:00:34.020 --> 01:00:36.500
Are you going to buy a sandwich today, Mr. McElroy?

01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:37.460
Still thinking about it.

01:00:37.460 --> 01:00:38.180
Give me a minute.

01:00:39.460 --> 01:00:40.980
Do you have that special bread?

01:00:40.980 --> 01:00:42.580
Have you guessed the kind of bread I like?

01:00:44.420 --> 01:00:46.180
Like Pee Rumpelstiltskin.

01:00:46.180 --> 01:00:52.660
You must solve my bread riddle before I buy a sandwich.

01:00:57.220 --> 01:00:59.380
After he's done, he just yelled, nice.

01:01:01.780 --> 01:01:05.380
Because I bet it'll take one or two of those before he gets the message.

01:01:05.380 --> 01:01:10.020
Yeah, you gotta think that the grandpa, if he knew,

01:01:10.020 --> 01:01:14.020
would not, he would also not be stoked about this arrangement.

01:01:14.020 --> 01:01:14.340
Right.

01:01:14.340 --> 01:01:15.700
Does he listen to the show?

01:01:15.700 --> 01:01:16.820
Because maybe.

01:01:16.820 --> 01:01:17.620
I think just.

01:01:17.620 --> 01:01:18.900
Hey, Henry's grandpa.

01:01:18.900 --> 01:01:20.500
Henry's grandpa, it's me.

01:01:20.500 --> 01:01:20.980
Hoops.

01:01:22.100 --> 01:01:23.060
There's your favorite.

01:01:23.060 --> 01:01:25.300
There's two stalls at Subway, my man.

01:01:27.300 --> 01:01:28.180
See you there.

01:01:28.180 --> 01:01:28.820
See you there.

01:01:29.380 --> 01:01:30.260
Come on down.

01:01:30.900 --> 01:01:32.420
Does that answer your question?

01:01:33.460 --> 01:01:33.940
Thank you.

01:01:34.820 --> 01:01:36.020
That's a little non-committal.

01:01:37.940 --> 01:01:41.140
Okay, so that's our candle night spectacular for the year.

01:01:42.020 --> 01:01:44.180
Seriously, thank you so much for coming to Huntington.

01:01:44.180 --> 01:01:45.140
That is so sweet of you.

01:01:45.140 --> 01:01:48.260
Yeah, we hope you all had a good time in our fair city.

01:01:48.900 --> 01:01:50.740
We love this city very much.

01:01:50.740 --> 01:01:52.580
We were very proud to shoot our TV show here.

01:01:52.580 --> 01:01:55.780
Hopefully you saw some of the landmarks from the TV show.

01:01:57.380 --> 01:02:01.620
Beloved West Virginia band, Ona, which is a very good band,

01:02:01.620 --> 01:02:04.820
is gonna be playing at the V Club at 1030 after our show.

01:02:04.820 --> 01:02:05.620
Like two blocks that way.

01:02:05.620 --> 01:02:07.060
Two blocks that way up on 8th Street.

01:02:07.620 --> 01:02:08.180
It should be fun.

01:02:08.180 --> 01:02:09.060
You should go check them out.

01:02:09.060 --> 01:02:10.180
We will not be able to hang out.

01:02:10.180 --> 01:02:14.020
We will not be there because we have a thousand children and we're very old.

01:02:14.020 --> 01:02:16.500
It's true.

01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:19.140
Thank you to Paul Sabourin, American hero.

01:02:24.020 --> 01:02:26.660
If you haven't listened to Paul and Storm, go to paulandstorm.com.

01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:27.460
You have, though.

01:02:27.460 --> 01:02:30.820
They were in the Christmas, the Candle Nights mix we played at the top of the show.

01:02:30.820 --> 01:02:34.580
We also want to say thank you to Still Buffering, to Sawbones, and to Schmanners.

01:02:34.580 --> 01:02:36.180
Schmanners was great, huh?

01:02:36.180 --> 01:02:37.300
Yeah, great show.

01:02:38.020 --> 01:02:40.260
Thank you to our daddy for playing us on.

01:02:41.220 --> 01:02:42.260
Thank you to-

01:02:42.260 --> 01:02:42.980
The Smurls.

01:02:42.980 --> 01:02:43.620
The Smurls.

01:02:43.620 --> 01:02:44.100
Thank you.

01:02:44.820 --> 01:02:49.380
Thank you to everybody who contributed to the Mabim Bam Angels initiative.

01:02:49.380 --> 01:02:49.860
Yes.

01:02:49.860 --> 01:02:54.740
It is like, it is still like the most humbling, like coolest thing every year that you all,

01:02:55.460 --> 01:02:59.460
most of whom don't live in the city, think to do something very nice for people who do

01:02:59.460 --> 01:03:00.100
live in the city.

01:03:00.100 --> 01:03:01.620
It means like the world to us.

01:03:01.620 --> 01:03:04.180
So thank you all if you contributed to that.

01:03:04.180 --> 01:03:10.180
Thank you to Riley Smurls and the Smurls for spearheading the Candle Nights stars.

01:03:10.180 --> 01:03:10.420
Yes.

01:03:10.420 --> 01:03:11.860
That you see here at the front of the stage.

01:03:11.860 --> 01:03:18.020
The, by the way, the Mabim Bam Angels, I just want to say that they claimed 100 stockings

01:03:18.020 --> 01:03:20.260
and raised $15,000 in donations.

01:03:20.260 --> 01:03:26.500
They're buying 15 beds, a bunch of appliances, clothes, slash winter gear, and toys for 30

01:03:26.500 --> 01:03:29.860
more children who weren't even on the original list.

01:03:29.860 --> 01:03:30.820
So they are-

01:03:30.820 --> 01:03:31.220
Wow.

01:03:31.220 --> 01:03:31.780
Dang it.

01:03:34.260 --> 01:03:35.460
That is, that's incredible.

01:03:35.460 --> 01:03:41.460
You, by coming, have helped us raise thousands upon thousands of dollars for Recovery Point,

01:03:41.460 --> 01:03:44.100
which is treating opiate addiction here in our area.

01:03:44.100 --> 01:03:46.100
So thank you so much from the bottom of our hearts.

01:03:50.180 --> 01:03:53.700
And thank you to John Rodrick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song instead

01:03:53.700 --> 01:03:55.700
of parts you're off the album putting the days to bed.

01:03:55.700 --> 01:03:56.660
Very good album.

01:03:56.660 --> 01:03:57.300
And-

01:03:57.300 --> 01:04:00.900
Oh, I also want to say thank you to Amanda, who you may have seen down in the lobby, who

01:04:00.900 --> 01:04:03.300
does a lot of work with us and she's quite amazing.

01:04:03.300 --> 01:04:04.660
And she's helped us out so much.

01:04:04.660 --> 01:04:06.260
Buy a poster by Emily.

01:04:06.260 --> 01:04:07.140
She is great too.

01:04:08.500 --> 01:04:10.420
Emily, is it Corrupted Jim on Twitter?

01:04:10.420 --> 01:04:10.920
Yeah.

01:04:10.920 --> 01:04:11.420
Yeah.

01:04:12.420 --> 01:04:12.920
Hi.

01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:13.420
Hi, Emily.

01:04:13.420 --> 01:04:13.920
Hey.

01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:14.420
I think that's right.

01:04:14.420 --> 01:04:14.920
Okay.

01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:15.420
Yeah.

01:04:16.420 --> 01:04:17.380
Here's the final Yahoo.

01:04:17.380 --> 01:04:17.880
Here it is.

01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:19.380
It was sent in by Zed.

01:04:19.380 --> 01:04:20.900
Thank you, Zed.

01:04:20.900 --> 01:04:23.700
It's asked by Yahoo Answers user.

01:04:23.700 --> 01:04:25.380
I think I'm going to get a name to load on this.

01:04:25.380 --> 01:04:25.880
Nope.

01:04:27.540 --> 01:04:34.820
Terry asks, is the Happy Honda Days promotion part of the war on Christmas?

01:04:37.700 --> 01:04:39.140
My name is Justin McElroy.

01:04:39.140 --> 01:04:41.380
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:04:41.380 --> 01:04:42.260
I'm Griffin McElroy.

01:04:42.260 --> 01:05:09.140
This has been My Brother, My Brother, My Brother.

01:05:09.140 --> 01:05:09.780
Hey, gang.

01:05:09.780 --> 01:05:14.740
This is Jesse and I am joined by Bikram, the managing director of Maximum Fund.

01:05:14.740 --> 01:05:15.620
Hi, everyone.

01:05:15.620 --> 01:05:20.180
So we have some really amazing news to close out 2018.

01:05:20.740 --> 01:05:25.460
After this spring's pledge drive, we gave members the chance to buy enamel pins

01:05:25.460 --> 01:05:30.980
with the full profits of those sales going to the National Immigration Law Center.

01:05:30.980 --> 01:05:34.100
This is a tough time to be an immigrant in the United States.

01:05:34.100 --> 01:05:36.820
As individuals, as a company, and as a community,

01:05:36.820 --> 01:05:40.740
we wanted to help provide resources for immigrants in the face of these attacks.

01:05:40.740 --> 01:05:42.740
We're proud to live in a nation of immigrants.

01:05:42.740 --> 01:05:47.140
And many of us here at Max Fund are immigrants or the children of immigrants ourselves.

01:05:47.140 --> 01:05:49.700
Together, we raised over $100,000.

01:05:50.500 --> 01:05:55.540
NILC will put that money to good use, providing legal representation to immigrants

01:05:55.540 --> 01:05:58.580
and their families who wouldn't otherwise be able to afford it.

01:05:58.580 --> 01:06:03.540
We are so proud of our community for making such an immense difference in so many lives.

01:06:03.540 --> 01:06:10.740
And whether you bought pins or not, you can help the NILC advocate for immigrants right now.

01:06:10.740 --> 01:06:16.740
All you have to do is go to maximumfund.org slash N-I-L-C.

01:06:16.740 --> 01:06:20.740
That's maximumfund.org slash N-I-L-C.

01:06:21.300 --> 01:06:24.580
Our thanks go to all of you who made this possible.

01:06:24.580 --> 01:06:26.020
Great work, everybody.

01:06:26.020 --> 01:06:33.700
And happy holidays from all of us at Max Fund.
