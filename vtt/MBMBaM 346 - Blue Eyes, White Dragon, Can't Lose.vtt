WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:47.920
Hello, everybody, and welcome ashore. My name is Justin McElroy. I'm my brother,

00:47.920 --> 00:52.240
my brother, me, this one. Ahoy there. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

00:52.240 --> 00:56.560
I'm your sweet baby brother, 30-30, luminary girlfriend McElroy.

00:56.560 --> 01:02.000
Lanto. Lanto. Our smoothest, like, name-saying, I think, to date.

01:02.000 --> 01:09.520
Yeah. Yeah. I'm back on shore. On land, I guess. I don't know how to think of it anymore.

01:09.520 --> 01:15.440
I used to think of myself as at sea, but then I think of this as at land now. You know?

01:17.440 --> 01:23.280
You've surfed, and now you're turfing. I'm both surf and turf simultaneously.

01:23.280 --> 01:29.200
At the same time? Yeah, I'm a delicious, pricey dish.

01:29.200 --> 01:31.840
So how's our opener going so far? Not good, I think.

01:31.840 --> 01:34.720
No, but listen. Oh, God, it's happening again. Not a joke.

01:34.720 --> 01:38.640
Okay, so yeah, walk us through what's happening right now in your, I guess, inner ear zone.

01:38.640 --> 01:47.680
I've been on the JoCo cruise for the past week. Just got back last night. Now, it was a fun

01:47.680 --> 01:55.280
conflation of things. First off, there's a three-hour time difference. We had a two-hour

01:55.280 --> 02:01.920
time difference, so it was like two hours before Eastern Standard Time for most of the cruise.

02:01.920 --> 02:07.520
And then right the last day, we got back to San Diego, and it was PST, so it was three hours

02:07.520 --> 02:17.120
difference. And then we flew back from PST and lost three hours that way. And then that night,

02:17.120 --> 02:20.560
it was daylight savings time. Got up another hour.

02:20.560 --> 02:25.440
For Justin, it's Thursday. So now I'm beyond the construct of time. I'm in all times.

02:26.240 --> 02:32.400
Beyond time and stationary land, what that feels like under your knees.

02:32.400 --> 02:36.560
You're Matthew McConaughey in whatever that Alien movie was that I've already forgotten the title.

02:36.560 --> 02:44.080
Whoa, shit. It's also not a joke that after you've been on a big cruise ship for a week

02:44.080 --> 02:53.200
and then you come home, your house feels like it's moving sometimes. That's especially noticeable.

02:53.200 --> 02:58.480
It's important to stay moving around because it becomes much more noticeable when you,

02:59.200 --> 03:05.360
let's say, sit stationary and stare at a screen and a microphone for an hour.

03:05.360 --> 03:07.360
Justin, is this something we are going to be getting,

03:07.360 --> 03:11.760
let's say, recurring updates on throughout the course of recording this episode?

03:11.760 --> 03:16.560
I don't feel like they'll be especially funny, so I'll try to keep them to a minimum.

03:16.560 --> 03:21.200
But if I stop mid-sentence, it's because my computer is falling through my desk

03:21.200 --> 03:22.800
and the wall is turning upside down.

03:23.920 --> 03:27.600
This is not fun, though. I want to hear about this sort of new oceanic mastery

03:28.160 --> 03:33.600
that you have fucking now that you went down Periscope for a while and you got out there

03:33.600 --> 03:38.560
on that big blue beautiful boy that we call the ocean. And what you learned out there,

03:38.560 --> 03:43.520
just sort of some nautical secrets and just some lessons that you learned from your new wife,

03:43.520 --> 03:44.480
the ocean.

03:44.480 --> 03:46.800
I will tell you this one nautical secret.

03:48.240 --> 03:51.600
Myself and Max Temkin of Cards Against Humanity learned this this week.

03:51.600 --> 03:57.680
If you start asking about the brig a lot, you are going to start getting some huffiness.

03:58.480 --> 04:03.280
We just want to see where the brig was because there's a brig for sure, right?

04:03.280 --> 04:08.960
There's got to be a brig. There's a boat jail, and I just want to see the boat jail once.

04:08.960 --> 04:09.920
Oh, yeah.

04:11.920 --> 04:15.360
How many Jimmy Buffett songs are there about boat jail?

04:16.080 --> 04:18.400
There's no boat jail songs, which is amazing.

04:18.400 --> 04:25.760
Boat jail. Boys in the band go to boat jail. All of my boys did some sea crime.

04:25.760 --> 04:27.840
Now they're in lockup.

04:29.760 --> 04:31.440
There's that one. Justin, you with us?

04:31.440 --> 04:32.240
There's that one.

04:32.240 --> 04:36.800
I'm here. I had another one. I had a good boy. Good, twisty boy.

04:36.800 --> 04:38.880
J Man, did you get to steer at all?

04:40.560 --> 04:44.320
They sell captain's hat. They sell captain's hats in the gift shop.

04:44.320 --> 04:44.640
All right.

04:44.640 --> 04:45.760
I have to talk about the gift shop.

04:46.320 --> 04:48.320
Listen, I'm going to talk about the gift shop.

04:48.320 --> 04:53.360
For one, this gift shop sold a lot of watches and crystals, and there were signs-

04:53.360 --> 04:54.480
Crystals, huh?

04:54.480 --> 04:56.960
Because all us nerds were on the cruise, there were signs like,

04:56.960 --> 05:01.120
be like the doctor and control space and time and buy one of these watches.

05:01.120 --> 05:04.320
And it almost worked. That's not how it works.

05:05.360 --> 05:09.360
If I buy a stethoscope and a thermometer, I'm not controlling medicine.

05:09.360 --> 05:10.160
You're right.

05:10.160 --> 05:12.880
And then they started showing Dr. Who in the gift shop, which is pretty good.

05:13.440 --> 05:14.880
That's good stuff.

05:14.880 --> 05:15.840
I'll kick it in there.

05:17.680 --> 05:20.080
We've got to go back in time. Let me touch my magic watch.

05:21.280 --> 05:23.920
It's 1884. Thanks, magic watch.

05:23.920 --> 05:26.480
You're welcome, Dr. Beepo Beepo.

05:26.480 --> 05:28.080
This is my magic watch, Beepo.

05:28.080 --> 05:34.480
Another thing I have to mention about the gift shop is that it was showing Dr. Who 24 hours a day,

05:34.480 --> 05:38.320
and there were people who worked there that were just like, I guess, just on a bench, man.

05:38.320 --> 05:40.240
Just like trucking their way through the tenant years.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.880
I had, obviously, I had diarrhea.

05:49.920 --> 05:50.400
All right.

05:50.960 --> 05:52.240
I obviously had diarrhea.

05:52.240 --> 06:02.080
At one point, the old, had the old hemorrhoids, pretty bad, started flaring up pretty bad.

06:02.080 --> 06:02.480
All right.

06:03.040 --> 06:04.560
And I kicked it on down to the gift shop.

06:05.600 --> 06:12.080
This gift shop will sell you a tray of delicious imported

06:12.880 --> 06:19.360
rum flavored chocolate turtles with sea salt on them for $10 in a box.

06:19.360 --> 06:25.200
Okay. And for the world's smallest tube of preparation age, it costs $17.95.

06:25.200 --> 06:27.040
All right, J-Dot, but you got to understand.

06:27.040 --> 06:28.080
They know their market.

06:28.080 --> 06:32.800
Yeah, they literally, they have you over an ocean sized barrel.

06:32.800 --> 06:33.920
What are you going to do?

06:33.920 --> 06:37.040
Get fucking medevaced for your butthole?

06:37.040 --> 06:42.000
That barrel is comically labeled diarrhea, like in an old political cartoon.

06:42.000 --> 06:42.640
Yeah.

06:42.640 --> 06:46.880
And they do have a medical center, so I could have kicked it.

06:46.880 --> 06:50.240
Oh, here we go.

06:50.240 --> 06:54.080
I could have kicked it down there and just been like, you know, look at me.

06:54.080 --> 06:54.960
You know what's up.

06:56.320 --> 07:00.480
I think they should just like, you walk in the door and they shoot you in the mouth with a

07:00.480 --> 07:01.440
Pepto gun.

07:01.440 --> 07:02.160
They just know.

07:02.800 --> 07:07.520
And you just walk in and there's just like a mouth level tray with Pepto on it that you

07:07.520 --> 07:10.400
can just sort of consume and be out of the door in three seconds.

07:10.400 --> 07:14.800
You should just walk into your hotel room and in your like state room and there's like a towel

07:14.800 --> 07:18.960
folded like a monkey and it's holding a tube of preparation age for you.

07:18.960 --> 07:21.120
How did you know about the towels folded like monkeys?

07:21.120 --> 07:22.320
Because I know things.

07:23.280 --> 07:30.400
I actually know it from John Hodgman's, I think it's more information than you require or it

07:30.400 --> 07:31.760
might be that is all.

07:31.760 --> 07:36.160
He talks about going on a cruise and about the different animal shapes and what they mean.

07:38.240 --> 07:39.760
I never knew that Mr.

07:39.760 --> 07:44.000
Hodgman also suffered from that very bad butt affliction.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.320
He does not talk about Preparation H.

07:46.320 --> 07:47.120
He actually-

07:47.120 --> 07:52.080
No, cause he has more decorum than the three of us like orangutans just like shouting about

07:52.080 --> 07:52.240
our shit every episode.

07:52.240 --> 07:56.640
What I was going to say before Griffin interrupted me was that the H stands for Hodgman.

07:56.640 --> 07:57.120
Oh, I see.

07:57.120 --> 08:00.320
He is the inventor of Preparation H, but I didn't get there.

08:00.320 --> 08:04.720
The problem with me going on a cruise and not getting to record this show for a week is I have

08:04.720 --> 08:07.280
so much to talk about and I didn't get to last week.

08:07.280 --> 08:12.640
So I'm sorry that we have like a bunch of different intros.

08:12.640 --> 08:16.080
But I have other things I need to cover if you guys can just hang with me.

08:16.080 --> 08:16.400
Yeah, sure.

08:16.400 --> 08:16.720
Hit it.

08:16.720 --> 08:18.400
Two more big bullet points.

08:19.200 --> 08:25.120
The first came yesterday when I was going back through security to get on to the plane in San

08:25.120 --> 08:30.400
Diego and as I was about to go through the backscatter machine, is that what it's called?

08:30.400 --> 08:31.200
Yeah, sure.

08:31.200 --> 08:34.320
Anyway, I was about to go through the backscatter machine and you know they got the metal detector

08:34.320 --> 08:36.240
next to it if you don't want to do the backscatter thing.

08:36.960 --> 08:42.160
As I was about to go through the backscatter machine, I see a security guard point at the

08:42.160 --> 08:43.200
person behind me.

08:43.200 --> 08:44.720
He looks at her and says,

08:45.840 --> 08:47.200
you got any metal in your body?

08:49.280 --> 08:50.080
All right.

08:50.080 --> 08:52.000
And she's like, what?

08:53.920 --> 08:55.200
Do you have any metal in your body?

08:56.720 --> 09:02.480
And it becomes clear fairly quickly that English is not this woman's first language.

09:02.480 --> 09:04.400
And English is my first language.

09:04.400 --> 09:07.360
And even I was a little bit like, excuse me?

09:07.360 --> 09:07.680
Yeah.

09:07.680 --> 09:13.440
Yeah, what can you just say what I want you to say with my heart, which is, are you a

09:13.440 --> 09:14.480
cyber grandma?

09:14.480 --> 09:21.360
Can you tell me if you are part cyborg, part robot, part woman, all grandma, all cyborg?

09:21.360 --> 09:22.320
You grandma Logan?

09:22.960 --> 09:24.080
You grandma Logan?

09:24.080 --> 09:25.760
This has nothing to do with my job.

09:25.760 --> 09:31.600
I just, it's a fascination of mine and you look like you might have some cyber components.

09:31.600 --> 09:33.120
Do you have cyber components?

09:33.120 --> 09:35.280
Are you enhanced with cyber components?

09:35.280 --> 09:37.920
Are you more machine than human at this point?

09:38.880 --> 09:39.920
All right, going through.

09:39.920 --> 09:42.800
This is really the main thing I wanted to talk about.

09:45.440 --> 09:56.400
Yesterday, I was driving back and was watching Trolls in the car and Riley, the sister-in-law,

09:56.400 --> 10:00.720
told me, I learned something by watching the credits of this movie.

10:00.720 --> 10:06.480
Did you know that pretty much all the people who have one line in this movie are all well

10:06.480 --> 10:08.240
known YouTubers?

10:08.240 --> 10:09.280
Oh, fuck me.

10:10.000 --> 10:15.280
And they did that because, so it's like kind of a cool marketing.

10:15.280 --> 10:16.400
It's a smart marketing.

10:16.400 --> 10:17.200
Yeah, really cool.

10:18.400 --> 10:26.800
So then as I'm driving, I like, things don't come to me this hard, but it was like, I finally

10:26.800 --> 10:28.080
understood the secret.

10:28.080 --> 10:28.640
You know what I mean?

10:28.640 --> 10:32.240
Like, I finally got visual, after joking about it for a long time, I finally understood the

10:32.240 --> 10:36.720
power of visualization because I could see the path to the thing I'm about to say so

10:36.720 --> 10:37.680
clearly.

10:37.680 --> 10:38.180
Okay.

10:40.320 --> 10:49.040
In April 2020, the three of us are going to be in Trolls 2.

10:49.040 --> 10:49.540
Okay.

10:50.400 --> 10:52.400
This is what I'm saying now.

10:52.400 --> 10:52.900
All right.

10:52.900 --> 10:54.400
It's March, 2017.

10:54.400 --> 10:56.880
We do really want to put out there that we have three years.

10:56.880 --> 10:58.560
We have three years.

10:58.560 --> 11:05.040
I'm putting out into the universe that the three of us will be in, I don't even want,

11:05.040 --> 11:09.760
I want to say are, but I feel like that is actually not visualization, it's just tense

11:09.760 --> 11:10.640
confusion.

11:10.640 --> 11:14.240
So I'm going to say will be in April 2020.

11:14.240 --> 11:18.480
And this is a sort of narrow casting for a second to our agent, Joel.

11:19.520 --> 11:23.920
Joel, Trolls 2, April 2020.

11:23.920 --> 11:28.240
I don't care if we, it's of one, it's all three of us or nothing.

11:28.240 --> 11:32.080
Two, I don't care if it's one word said simultaneously.

11:32.080 --> 11:32.560
Yeah, we all sound the same.

11:32.560 --> 11:34.320
We're in Trolls 2, and I'll notice.

11:34.320 --> 11:35.840
We're in Trolls 2, Joel.

11:36.480 --> 11:46.400
The main troll, Bimbo, turns to their friend Charlotte and says, who are those clowns?

11:46.400 --> 11:50.480
And turns to us three, and we all are trolls of different shapes and sizes.

11:50.480 --> 11:51.760
And we're just like, Bazinga.

11:52.400 --> 11:52.800
Yep.

11:52.800 --> 11:57.440
While my brothers are having a great time with their ignorance of the Trolls franchise,

11:57.440 --> 12:00.000
I will also come in and do like some story punch ups.

12:00.000 --> 12:00.720
Yeah, I'm sorry, I haven't seen that.

12:00.720 --> 12:03.040
I've seen that movie quite a few fucking times.

12:04.000 --> 12:09.280
And I will just, not to say the first one needed punch up, although there was some thematic

12:09.280 --> 12:11.360
elements that I felt like could have been clarified.

12:11.360 --> 12:11.840
Okay.

12:11.840 --> 12:15.840
Like the parallels to drug addiction were like there, but I felt like weren't pronounced

12:15.840 --> 12:18.160
enough, could have been a little bit, hit a little bit harder.

12:18.160 --> 12:19.520
So I'm happy to do that work for you.

12:19.520 --> 12:23.920
But we will be in Trolls 2 in April 2020.

12:23.920 --> 12:28.080
All three McElroy brothers, add it to IMDB if you want.

12:28.080 --> 12:31.040
But we will be in Trolls 2 in April 2020.

12:31.040 --> 12:32.880
Give me Jeffrey Katz on the phone.

12:32.880 --> 12:34.240
Give me whoever I need to talk to.

12:34.960 --> 12:39.680
Justin Timms, Anna Kin-kin, Kin-kin, whoever.

12:40.880 --> 12:42.400
We're going to be in Trolls 2.

12:42.400 --> 12:43.360
I'm excited, man.

12:43.360 --> 12:45.280
I'm psyched out of my mind.

12:45.280 --> 12:49.920
I wish maybe we hadn't talked so much yay about, you know, oh, are you gone again?

12:49.920 --> 12:51.600
We didn't talk any yay about it.

12:51.600 --> 12:53.360
We pretended to be excited about it.

12:53.360 --> 12:56.960
Now, after I've seen it 30 times, I'm really excited about it.

12:56.960 --> 12:58.160
It was real to me, damn it.

12:58.160 --> 13:00.000
Let's get to, can we do questions?

13:00.000 --> 13:00.720
Can I tell, okay.

13:01.280 --> 13:05.440
As long as we're saying things that happened in the last two weeks, because we, no, because

13:05.440 --> 13:12.800
we missed an episode, we have 1500 new emails for this week.

13:12.800 --> 13:19.200
And so I was able to kind of build a bit of a theme for this episode.

13:19.200 --> 13:20.720
Oh, hell yeah.

13:20.720 --> 13:22.000
That's really exciting.

13:23.920 --> 13:27.280
Okay, yeah, I'm reading some of the questions now and I can kind of, okay, this is fun,

13:27.280 --> 13:28.560
Trav, what you've made for us.

13:28.560 --> 13:29.680
Let's get started.

13:30.880 --> 13:31.920
When I was out buying-

13:33.920 --> 13:35.760
Read the fucking do it, yes.

13:35.760 --> 13:37.840
Hey, listen, I'm trying to just hang in there, okay?

13:38.640 --> 13:40.800
Justin's trying to read this from the sunken place.

13:40.800 --> 13:41.840
He's having a hard time.

13:41.840 --> 13:44.000
I'm back, I'm back from the upside down, everyone.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.280
Justin's in the sunless sea.

13:48.560 --> 13:53.520
When I was out buying special edition ketchup Doritos, a guy in the convenience store stopped

13:53.520 --> 13:58.800
me, told me I was bootiful, and told me he couldn't let me go without giving me something.

13:58.800 --> 14:01.840
He hands me a piece of paper and I think he's giving me his number.

14:01.840 --> 14:03.600
It's a coupon for a whopper.

14:05.600 --> 14:06.480
It's a coupon for a whopper.

14:06.480 --> 14:08.080
Do you know what this means?

14:08.080 --> 14:09.440
Is this how kids flirt?

14:09.440 --> 14:12.960
That's from Confuse Canuck.

14:12.960 --> 14:16.400
There's a lot, there's a lot here, huh?

14:16.400 --> 14:17.840
There's a lot to sort of unpack.

14:19.280 --> 14:24.640
There's a lot of runes and glyphs that we need to sort of decipher, I think.

14:24.640 --> 14:27.360
Yeah, I need a codex.

14:27.360 --> 14:28.640
Need a codex for this.

14:29.440 --> 14:31.920
Yeah, so you're going to get the ketchup Doritos.

14:31.920 --> 14:36.400
And like at this point, you're lucky that we continued to read the remainder of the question.

14:36.400 --> 14:38.000
Right, is that a Canadian exclusive?

14:38.000 --> 14:40.080
I haven't seen those on shelves.

14:40.080 --> 14:41.920
There's a lot of, probably.

14:41.920 --> 14:44.800
Although ketchup's not really their forte.

14:44.800 --> 14:48.480
Like their sort of specialty is like gravy and cheese on fries.

14:48.480 --> 14:53.200
Yeah, but that's what makes it, that's what makes it exotic, exactly, right?

14:54.640 --> 14:56.320
I don't think, I don't think you can-

14:56.320 --> 14:57.760
It's imported from Canada.

14:57.760 --> 14:59.680
Interesting, I don't think you can call-

14:59.680 --> 15:02.800
I mean, it's not imported from Canada if you're in Canada, it's just there.

15:02.800 --> 15:06.640
I don't think you can call them the ketchup Doritos special edition.

15:06.640 --> 15:09.200
I think it's just edition.

15:09.200 --> 15:12.800
I don't think there's anything especially special about ketchup flavored Doritos.

15:12.800 --> 15:16.240
I do, my favorite part about this whole question is imagining

15:16.800 --> 15:21.120
that this convenience store worker needed this whopper coupon.

15:21.120 --> 15:24.960
Like this was going to be, this was when his whole plan for lunch was like,

15:24.960 --> 15:29.200
I've been saving this coupon and I'm going to treat myself to a free whopper

15:29.200 --> 15:31.520
because the most delicious whopper is a free whopper.

15:31.520 --> 15:32.000
I see.

15:32.640 --> 15:33.120
But then-

15:33.120 --> 15:37.520
Then this is like when Christ went to the temple and somebody was like,

15:37.520 --> 15:39.920
here's a buck, I have a million bucks, but here's one.

15:39.920 --> 15:43.760
And then the other person was like, I only have one buck, but here's my one buck.

15:43.760 --> 15:45.760
And it was like, that's a hundred percent of your bucks.

15:45.760 --> 15:49.440
So this is a hundred percent of the whopper coupons this person had

15:49.440 --> 15:50.560
and they were very excited about it.

15:50.560 --> 15:56.400
And so this gift was such a huge sacrifice that it means a lot to them.

15:56.400 --> 16:00.160
And this is serendipity too, because his number is written on the coupon,

16:00.160 --> 16:03.040
but what you need to do is take that coupon, get that whopper,

16:03.040 --> 16:05.200
and then if that coupon comes back to you-

16:05.200 --> 16:06.560
There it is, serendipity too.

16:07.600 --> 16:11.360
I can officially declare that coupons are basically a curse.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.400
You hand someone a coupon, you've basically cursed them.

16:14.400 --> 16:18.400
Because what this means is like, now you have to,

16:19.280 --> 16:22.320
just using this as an example, but it applies to all coupons.

16:22.320 --> 16:23.120
Here's a coupon.

16:23.680 --> 16:26.720
Now you have to go to this place and buy something you weren't planning on

16:26.720 --> 16:29.520
or feel like you were throwing away money.

16:29.520 --> 16:31.920
And one of those two things has to happen.

16:31.920 --> 16:36.000
The only way to free yourself from a coupon is after it expires.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.480
You can be like, ah, the money disappeared.

16:38.480 --> 16:41.600
Now I can throw this away with a clean conscience.

16:42.160 --> 16:45.920
But until then, it's a curse.

16:45.920 --> 16:47.680
Coupons are basically a curse.

16:47.680 --> 16:50.240
If coupons are a curse,

16:50.240 --> 16:54.000
then the Bed Bath and Beyond near my house is low key the Baba Yaga.

16:57.680 --> 16:59.360
Ah, the coupons expired.

16:59.360 --> 17:01.360
It's not, but it says it never.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.880
Free me from this curse, please.

17:06.880 --> 17:08.720
Because it looks like money.

17:08.720 --> 17:10.880
It looks like fun burger money.

17:10.880 --> 17:11.440
You know what I mean?

17:11.440 --> 17:15.760
It's got like the big free and big letters.

17:15.760 --> 17:18.560
And it's like, get a free sandwich or whatever.

17:19.200 --> 17:20.560
And you feel like you're throwing away money

17:20.560 --> 17:21.680
when you throw away a coupon.

17:21.680 --> 17:23.840
It's like, man, I could have used that for a free sandwich.

17:23.840 --> 17:26.640
But in order to redeem it, you have to go through so many hoops.

17:26.640 --> 17:28.080
And nobody remembers.

17:28.080 --> 17:30.640
How many times, the worst part of the coupon experience

17:30.640 --> 17:33.280
is when you go to Burger King and you forget.

17:33.280 --> 17:36.560
And then as you're opening your wallet to put your receipt in

17:36.560 --> 17:38.480
because you save all your Burger King receipts

17:38.480 --> 17:39.360
because they're nasty.

17:39.360 --> 17:40.080
For taxes.

17:40.880 --> 17:43.040
You see in there the Burger King coupon.

17:43.040 --> 17:44.160
You're like, oh no.

17:44.160 --> 17:44.800
Shit.

17:44.800 --> 17:45.520
Not like this.

17:47.200 --> 17:49.280
All I can picture too is that, walk up to the counter.

17:49.280 --> 17:51.120
I would like one Whopper, please.

17:52.080 --> 17:54.240
No, just the burger.

17:54.240 --> 17:56.320
All right, that'll be like a dollar, I guess.

17:56.320 --> 17:57.760
Yes, no, it will not.

17:57.760 --> 17:58.800
It will not today.

17:59.440 --> 18:02.400
Take this piece of garbage and give me that burger.

18:02.400 --> 18:05.520
I have a Yahoo transition that's really good here.

18:05.520 --> 18:07.360
That's going to stay on theme, Travis.

18:07.360 --> 18:08.640
Very excited for it.

18:08.640 --> 18:11.520
It was sent in by Amelia Burger.

18:13.440 --> 18:17.200
The question is not about food, but it's asked by Pee Pee Slap.

18:17.200 --> 18:20.160
And this is actually Yahoo Answers Now, which, okay, yes.

18:21.760 --> 18:24.080
It's Yahoo Answers Now, which I'm still unsure

18:24.080 --> 18:26.480
what the distinction is between Yahoo Answers

18:26.480 --> 18:29.440
and Yahoo Answers Now, which is like, how's your branding?

18:29.440 --> 18:32.480
Because I use this motherfucker every single week of my life.

18:33.440 --> 18:35.280
But anyway, this Yahoo Answers Now from Pee Pee Slap.

18:35.280 --> 18:35.920
I like that.

18:35.920 --> 18:38.800
I like that too, because it's like, Yahoo Answers Now.

18:39.440 --> 18:40.640
No, don't think about it.

18:40.640 --> 18:41.840
You're thinking too much.

18:41.840 --> 18:43.520
That's been the problem with Yahoo Answers,

18:43.520 --> 18:45.920
is people contemplating too long.

18:45.920 --> 18:47.200
Just shoot from the hip.

18:47.200 --> 18:48.560
This is a Rorschach test.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
Pee Pee Slap asks in card games.

18:52.000 --> 18:52.560
It's an app.

18:52.560 --> 18:53.520
It's a mobile app.

18:53.520 --> 18:54.480
Oh, okay, I see.

18:54.480 --> 18:55.120
That's your answer.

18:56.000 --> 18:56.160
Pee Pee Slap.

18:56.160 --> 18:58.400
For when you really need Yahoo Answers on the go.

18:58.400 --> 19:00.240
How many times am I gonna say Pee Pee Slap?

19:00.240 --> 19:01.280
Because we keep getting interrupted.

19:01.280 --> 19:02.000
Let's find out.

19:02.560 --> 19:03.600
Pee Pee Slap asks,

19:05.760 --> 19:08.480
how do you tell someone they are bad at Yu-Gi-Oh?

19:12.080 --> 19:14.480
No additional details, but this is great.

19:14.480 --> 19:16.240
It's a really, like, here's the thing.

19:16.240 --> 19:22.400
Jeremy, you've spent $3,000 on these cool cards,

19:23.840 --> 19:27.360
but you just can't seem to beat anybody at the game.

19:27.360 --> 19:28.640
And you need to stop.

19:28.640 --> 19:30.720
If this is the sunk cost fallacy,

19:30.720 --> 19:33.760
you're hoping you're gonna get the card or cards

19:33.760 --> 19:36.240
you need to put a winning Yu-Gi-Oh game together.

19:36.240 --> 19:38.960
And my friend, if it hasn't happened yet,

19:38.960 --> 19:40.880
I just don't believe it's gonna happen.

19:41.440 --> 19:43.840
Listen, kids, you just don't have the spark.

19:43.840 --> 19:45.600
You don't have the spark.

19:45.600 --> 19:47.360
Yu-Gi-Oh had the spark.

19:47.360 --> 19:49.440
You don't have what it takes to go pro.

19:50.480 --> 19:52.080
You just don't have it.

19:55.280 --> 19:57.920
Yeah, if you don't have the blue eyes white dragon,

19:57.920 --> 19:59.840
it's the only Yu-Gi-Oh shit I know.

19:59.840 --> 20:02.240
And I'm gonna reference it about 10 more times.

20:02.240 --> 20:02.880
Here's the thing.

20:02.880 --> 20:05.200
Here's what they don't tell you in Yu-Gi-Oh school.

20:05.200 --> 20:07.360
It's okay to not go pro.

20:07.360 --> 20:08.880
Not everyone's gonna go pro.

20:08.880 --> 20:13.360
You can have another job and just do Yu-Gi-Oh for fun.

20:13.360 --> 20:15.840
Do it on the amateur level just because you love it.

20:15.840 --> 20:16.400
You know what I mean?

20:16.400 --> 20:18.480
You don't have to like commit.

20:18.480 --> 20:20.080
You don't have to say like, no,

20:20.080 --> 20:23.840
I'm gonna quit the accounting firm and just Yu-Gi-Oh full time.

20:23.840 --> 20:26.240
Now I will say in the Yu-Gi-Oh anime,

20:26.240 --> 20:29.120
I'm pretty sure the protagonist had to win certain games

20:29.120 --> 20:30.720
or else his grandpa would die.

20:31.280 --> 20:35.200
And in those games, it was actually very important

20:35.200 --> 20:37.280
that he do well in the game.

20:37.280 --> 20:38.640
And like winning isn't everything

20:38.640 --> 20:40.800
unless your grandpa's soul is on the line.

20:40.800 --> 20:42.080
In which case I do actually think

20:42.080 --> 20:45.280
you need to pull out a W on this one, Mr. Yu-Gi-Oh.

20:45.280 --> 20:46.800
Do you think that that's what everybody

20:46.800 --> 20:49.200
in the Yu-Gi-Oh universe was playing for?

20:49.200 --> 20:50.960
Like your grandfather too?

20:50.960 --> 20:51.520
Yeah, my girl.

20:51.520 --> 20:52.160
Your grandfather?

20:53.040 --> 20:54.640
Did they take all of our grandpas?

20:55.280 --> 20:58.080
Is somebody just holding all of our grandpas hostage?

20:58.080 --> 21:00.080
I feel like the person who wrote this question

21:00.560 --> 21:03.600
is on the wrong end of a pretty bad grift.

21:04.160 --> 21:05.440
And it's a hustle.

21:05.440 --> 21:07.600
And what I think is that their friend

21:07.600 --> 21:09.680
has been following their Yahoo Answers account

21:09.680 --> 21:11.040
waiting for this exact moment.

21:11.040 --> 21:11.520
Okay.

21:11.520 --> 21:13.680
There's a very different version of this

21:13.680 --> 21:16.480
where like we see over the shoulder the friend type like,

21:16.480 --> 21:18.320
how do I tell my friend he's not?

21:18.320 --> 21:20.240
And then the friend like turns around

21:20.240 --> 21:21.600
because he's been watching the whole time

21:21.600 --> 21:24.160
and he's like, finally, the trap is set.

21:24.960 --> 21:27.280
Finally, it's time to spring it on him.

21:27.280 --> 21:29.760
And then the next time they play, he's like, listen,

21:31.520 --> 21:34.160
I know you've been thinking and asking on Yahoo Answers

21:34.160 --> 21:36.400
a lot lately about how I should get out of the game.

21:36.400 --> 21:39.360
And I feel like maybe if you beat me this time,

21:39.360 --> 21:40.400
I'll stop playing.

21:40.400 --> 21:42.000
And just to make it like even sillier,

21:43.280 --> 21:46.000
if I beat you, you give me-

21:46.000 --> 21:47.920
Your grandpa's soul.

21:47.920 --> 21:49.440
Give me your grandpa's soul.

21:49.440 --> 21:51.680
Like I get your grandpa, no big deal.

21:51.680 --> 21:53.600
Because he's like, I'm so bad, right?

21:53.600 --> 21:54.800
And it's like, all right, Jeremy,

21:54.800 --> 21:56.000
time to put you out of your misery.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.720
And he's like, blue eyes, white dragon, blow.

21:59.440 --> 22:00.400
And you lose, I guess.

22:01.040 --> 22:02.480
I didn't watch that much of the show,

22:02.480 --> 22:04.240
but I'm pretty sure there's one card called

22:04.240 --> 22:05.280
blue eyes, white dragon.

22:05.280 --> 22:06.800
That's just the best card.

22:06.800 --> 22:13.840
Blue eyes, white dragon, can't lose.

22:13.840 --> 22:14.720
Oh, God.

22:15.440 --> 22:17.600
Man, that joke requires you to understand

22:17.600 --> 22:19.440
so many different pieces of media.

22:19.440 --> 22:20.480
A lot of levels.

22:20.480 --> 22:22.240
This actually might be the only podcast

22:22.240 --> 22:29.200
in which that joke lands.

22:29.200 --> 22:32.000
It also had the trademark macarons so excited

22:32.000 --> 22:33.920
to get to make the joke tone of voice

22:33.920 --> 22:35.200
that always makes me so happy.

22:35.200 --> 22:39.440
Yeah, this would be like Saturday morning JCC tables.

22:40.800 --> 22:42.400
And it's just like you go and you play

22:42.400 --> 22:44.160
in some low level Yu-Gi-Oh tournaments,

22:44.160 --> 22:46.000
but coach Eric Taylor is there.

22:46.000 --> 22:46.880
And Tammy's there too.

22:46.880 --> 22:48.640
Maybe in this one, Tammy's like the fucking...

22:49.680 --> 22:51.840
Coach Eric Taylor can handle all the football stuff.

22:51.840 --> 22:53.840
Tammy's at the fucking Yu-Gi-Oh table,

22:53.840 --> 22:55.840
like bringing the sheet.

22:55.840 --> 22:56.960
She needs to blow off some steam

22:56.960 --> 22:58.160
because Julie's putting her through

22:58.160 --> 23:00.320
the fucking ringer again for no reason at all.

23:00.320 --> 23:02.240
She's just trying to do her best as a mom

23:02.240 --> 23:03.920
living here in this small Texas town.

23:03.920 --> 23:06.160
So she goes to the JCC and blows off some steam

23:06.160 --> 23:07.680
at the fucking tables

23:07.680 --> 23:10.000
and just like drops that blue eyes white dragon.

23:10.000 --> 23:10.640
This is actually a fact.

23:10.640 --> 23:12.640
Can you just like imagine like coach Taylor

23:12.640 --> 23:14.880
is like enjoying a nice real at Applebee's

23:14.880 --> 23:16.640
and he like turns behind him and he's like,

23:16.640 --> 23:19.360
hey, saw you boys playing Yu-Gi-Oh.

23:20.800 --> 23:22.720
You got something raw, I can mold.

23:23.360 --> 23:24.400
Come join my team.

23:25.040 --> 23:26.080
In Friday Night Lights,

23:26.080 --> 23:28.960
anytime you do not see a character on screen,

23:28.960 --> 23:30.240
they are playing Yu-Gi-Oh.

23:30.240 --> 23:34.240
You know Landry's in it.

23:34.240 --> 23:36.000
You know Landry's deep in that shit.

23:37.280 --> 23:39.840
How did he keep his Sandy when he was in the hospital?

23:39.840 --> 23:41.280
Yeah, you guessed it.

23:41.280 --> 23:43.280
He was playing Yu-Gi-Oh the entire time

23:44.000 --> 23:46.480
with himself honing like a chess master.

23:46.480 --> 23:46.720
Yeah.

23:48.640 --> 23:51.200
Okay, so I don't think we need to tell them

23:51.200 --> 23:52.560
how to tell them they're bad at Yu-Gi-Oh.

23:52.560 --> 23:55.680
You can just, I think just someone just tell yourself.

23:55.680 --> 23:56.640
I found out this evening

23:56.640 --> 23:59.200
that my little sister eats soup with a fork.

23:59.200 --> 24:01.360
She eats all the vegetables and meat

24:01.360 --> 24:02.640
and just leaves the broth.

24:02.640 --> 24:03.120
Okay.

24:03.120 --> 24:03.920
What should I do?

24:04.560 --> 24:06.080
That's from sad soup sibling.

24:06.880 --> 24:08.160
Fine, let's get into it.

24:08.160 --> 24:09.600
Yeah, you're just treating this soup

24:09.600 --> 24:11.360
like a sort of shabu-shabu pot

24:11.360 --> 24:14.320
where it's just like, no, you don't drink the broth.

24:14.320 --> 24:16.320
The broth is what cooks the stuff.

24:16.320 --> 24:18.400
No, the broth is where the money is.

24:18.400 --> 24:22.160
Yeah, it feels like if you're doing this,

24:22.160 --> 24:22.960
you don't understand.

24:22.960 --> 24:26.800
Like somebody spilled liquid on this meat and vegetables.

24:26.800 --> 24:28.960
Yeah, what do you do when you get a fucking nice soup?

24:28.960 --> 24:30.960
A nice like tomato basil soup

24:30.960 --> 24:32.480
and you like somebody sets it down in front

24:32.480 --> 24:34.560
and you're like, somebody already finished this soup

24:34.560 --> 24:35.840
because there's nothing in it.

24:35.840 --> 24:37.360
When you guys make a soup at home,

24:38.640 --> 24:41.520
do you get really paranoid and very particular

24:41.520 --> 24:44.160
when you're ladling your soup out into your bowl

24:44.160 --> 24:47.040
to make sure to leave the future iteration for yourself

24:47.040 --> 24:51.760
a very good stuffings to soup ratio?

24:51.760 --> 24:53.600
I try to be very careful about that.

24:53.600 --> 24:55.440
You gotta have that balance.

24:55.440 --> 24:58.000
I don't do much self souping, to be honest.

24:58.000 --> 25:01.040
It's usually something that other people prepare for me.

25:01.840 --> 25:02.400
I don't do any.

25:02.400 --> 25:03.360
I don't have that kind of budget.

25:05.520 --> 25:07.120
You don't have your own saucier?

25:07.120 --> 25:13.200
My problem is that I always over bit the soup.

25:13.200 --> 25:15.520
There's not enough broth, too many bits.

25:15.520 --> 25:19.280
And what you end up with is like a suggestion of broth

25:19.280 --> 25:21.040
in a pile of bits.

25:21.040 --> 25:23.280
If that's not soup, that's just a hot pile.

25:23.840 --> 25:26.800
Yeah, then you just have a pile with some sauce.

25:26.800 --> 25:30.080
I would always prefer, I dump out the broth of my ramen.

25:31.760 --> 25:34.080
I want it to, before I add the seasoning packet.

25:34.080 --> 25:37.840
So it's like highly concentrated, just the nudes, ma'am.

25:37.840 --> 25:39.840
And I, not nudes.

25:39.840 --> 25:41.760
Yeah, that was a rough one, Juice.

25:41.760 --> 25:44.480
Let me try again, like noodles, not nudes.

25:44.480 --> 25:48.160
I know, but the way you said it was really stinked.

25:48.160 --> 25:49.920
It got into a drag that thing.

25:49.920 --> 25:51.440
That's not a point of reference for me

25:51.440 --> 25:52.960
that I'm really sorry about.

25:52.960 --> 25:55.120
Well, I like the chunkens.

25:55.120 --> 25:56.960
I don't really need the broth.

25:56.960 --> 25:58.400
I brought my own drink, thanks.

25:58.400 --> 25:59.520
I'm just gonna enjoy.

25:59.520 --> 26:01.360
I'm actually kind of into this.

26:01.360 --> 26:02.880
The only problem I have with the fork

26:02.880 --> 26:05.920
is I think it would be hard bite composition

26:06.480 --> 26:08.160
to get the right bite composition.

26:08.160 --> 26:10.320
Like a spoon is much better for that, I think.

26:10.320 --> 26:12.640
A slotted spoon would be perfect, it sounds like.

26:12.640 --> 26:16.080
A small slotted spoon would be so choice.

26:16.080 --> 26:17.680
Do you eat those?

26:19.520 --> 26:21.040
First of all, I wanna say I'm very disappointed in you

26:21.040 --> 26:23.120
for not eating your ramen in the Japanese style.

26:23.120 --> 26:26.400
Hey, Griff, do you wanna be rich?

26:26.400 --> 26:27.520
Yeah, sure.

26:27.520 --> 26:29.680
Can you make some small slotted spoons

26:29.680 --> 26:30.560
and trademark that?

26:31.120 --> 26:32.800
Because I think that's a very good idea.

26:32.800 --> 26:36.240
Wait, you're talking, you just said it?

26:36.240 --> 26:37.200
That's a TM, right?

26:37.200 --> 26:38.000
That's a TM?

26:38.000 --> 26:38.800
I guess TM.

26:38.800 --> 26:39.920
You could have something there.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.520
But I don't wanna have invented this

26:43.520 --> 26:45.360
because it kind of goes against everything I'm against,

26:45.360 --> 26:47.760
which is just like, I think broth is very, very good

26:47.760 --> 26:49.040
and you drink it on a cold day

26:49.040 --> 26:50.640
and your lungs feel good.

26:50.640 --> 26:52.560
Oh, yeah.

26:52.560 --> 26:53.760
Are you gone?

26:53.760 --> 26:54.400
No, it's good.

26:54.400 --> 26:54.880
I'm thinking it's good.

26:54.880 --> 26:58.080
Sorry, you were having a good broth memory.

26:58.080 --> 27:00.000
I thought you were going to the deep place.

27:00.000 --> 27:04.640
No, I think it's starting to wear off.

27:04.640 --> 27:05.680
Oh, good.

27:05.680 --> 27:07.200
Yeah, I'm getting there.

27:07.200 --> 27:08.320
Enough coffee and stuff.

27:09.120 --> 27:11.120
I'm afraid it'll go too far the other way, Justin,

27:11.120 --> 27:14.080
and you'll just be super present all of a sudden.

27:14.080 --> 27:16.960
You'll be operating lawnmower man-esque levels

27:16.960 --> 27:18.080
of understanding.

27:18.080 --> 27:20.000
You're gonna be like fucking Superman

27:20.000 --> 27:21.280
powered by our yellow sun

27:21.280 --> 27:23.600
without that Krypton gravity or whatever.

27:26.080 --> 27:27.440
I feel like this for me,

27:27.440 --> 27:30.160
part of it also depends on the broth.

27:30.160 --> 27:32.000
If it's a tomatoey soup,

27:32.000 --> 27:35.200
I don't normally go in for like drinking that.

27:35.200 --> 27:36.880
Like a chickeny kind of broth,

27:36.880 --> 27:38.640
I definitely could just drink that straight.

27:39.760 --> 27:41.040
Okay, I'm glad we fucking settled that.

27:41.040 --> 27:42.640
I was really worried actually.

27:42.640 --> 27:45.200
So now it's made perfectly clear.

27:45.200 --> 27:48.160
Well, this is why you always have to do a brothy soup

27:48.160 --> 27:50.720
and like a crunchy grilled cheese sandwich

27:50.720 --> 27:52.240
so you can eat the dip-ums.

27:52.240 --> 27:54.800
You eat out the chunkums and then you eat the dip-ums.

27:57.040 --> 27:58.240
Can I do a yahoo?

27:58.880 --> 28:00.880
Love soup, love soup.

28:00.880 --> 28:01.840
Top notch.

28:01.840 --> 28:03.120
Now this is some revisionist history.

28:03.120 --> 28:04.880
You can't say that you don't eat the fucking broth

28:04.880 --> 28:05.840
and then say you love soup.

28:05.840 --> 28:07.040
That's like saying I love pizza,

28:07.040 --> 28:09.840
but I scrape all the shit off the crust

28:09.840 --> 28:11.920
and I just eat like a little cheese mess.

28:11.920 --> 28:15.200
No, it's like low pressure regular food.

28:15.200 --> 28:17.280
It's like, hey, listen, I know what a bummer it is

28:17.280 --> 28:19.280
to try to figure out like what you're gonna eat

28:19.280 --> 28:21.920
or how much you're gonna eat or like how to get

28:21.920 --> 28:23.840
good proportions of bites or whatever.

28:23.840 --> 28:26.240
So we just dumped it in all of the vat for you.

28:26.240 --> 28:27.840
We're just serving it up straight.

28:27.840 --> 28:29.360
Soup is food sweatpants.

28:31.280 --> 28:33.120
This yahoo was sent in by Irham Wazessa.

28:33.120 --> 28:34.800
Thank you, Irham, you're crushing it.

28:34.800 --> 28:36.240
It's from yahoo answers user.

28:36.240 --> 28:37.280
Sorry, something's gone wrong.

28:37.840 --> 28:38.640
I'm gonna call him.

28:40.880 --> 28:42.400
Oh God, it just got fucking deleted.

28:42.400 --> 28:43.040
I refreshed it.

28:43.040 --> 28:44.160
What the fuck?

28:44.160 --> 28:46.960
I just fucking refreshed the page and it got deleted.

28:46.960 --> 28:47.840
Why did it get deleted?

28:47.840 --> 28:49.760
It was totally innocuous.

28:49.760 --> 28:51.760
Well, now I gotta go to the fucking internet archive

28:51.760 --> 28:54.400
and pull up this fucking deep web illegal question.

28:56.240 --> 28:59.920
This was not, this was not that fucking bad of a question.

29:00.480 --> 29:01.360
All right, pull that up.

29:01.360 --> 29:02.960
Let me grab the fucking cash.

29:03.680 --> 29:05.520
What the fuck though, seriously?

29:06.160 --> 29:07.280
And the cash isn't loading.

29:07.280 --> 29:09.040
So this one, I lost it guys.

29:10.960 --> 29:11.760
It just gone.

29:13.040 --> 29:15.200
So what, do you remember kind of what it was about?

29:15.200 --> 29:18.400
Give me the five, give me the fucking text only version.

29:18.960 --> 29:19.680
View source.

29:20.400 --> 29:21.200
Why is it gone?

29:22.560 --> 29:25.280
I'm literally looking at the fucking metadata.

29:25.280 --> 29:29.200
I'm looking at the fucking like meta name equals title content.

29:30.080 --> 29:31.680
And all right, not this one.

29:31.680 --> 29:33.760
The data's not in the bucket.

29:33.760 --> 29:35.520
Is prod static true?

29:35.520 --> 29:38.480
Sorry guys, I gotta get into the fucking like hacker code.

29:39.040 --> 29:40.640
This is garbage from a toilet.

29:40.640 --> 29:41.680
This fucking sucks.

29:41.680 --> 29:43.680
All right, here we go.

29:43.680 --> 29:51.280
It was asked by Yahoo Answers user fucking swordfish asks,

29:52.320 --> 29:54.960
shoes off at the door, a growing trend?

29:56.320 --> 29:58.160
I am fairly new to having a rule in our home

29:58.160 --> 30:00.720
that everyone takes off their shoes.

30:01.360 --> 30:03.920
Recently, I've been noticing that more and more people seem to be adopting

30:03.920 --> 30:04.880
the same practice in their home.

30:04.880 --> 30:06.720
I'm curious if anyone else is seeing this trend.

30:07.440 --> 30:08.640
What do you do in your home?

30:08.640 --> 30:09.520
Are shoes allowed?

30:09.520 --> 30:10.480
What about your kids?

30:10.480 --> 30:12.400
Are shoes allowed? What about your guests?

30:12.400 --> 30:14.960
Now that we have the rule in our home, I really like it.

30:14.960 --> 30:16.480
What is common in your area?

30:17.520 --> 30:19.120
So another smooth transition.

30:19.120 --> 30:21.040
We're talking about doing things in the Japanese style.

30:22.240 --> 30:24.000
I think I could get into this.

30:24.000 --> 30:25.840
I don't enforce this in my home at all.

30:25.840 --> 30:29.520
And now I'm worried about sort of the grubbiness of our floors

30:30.960 --> 30:34.000
or whether people are showing disrespect to me in my sort of my zone.

30:34.800 --> 30:39.440
Griffey, normally in the Yahoo Answers portion here,

30:39.440 --> 30:44.640
it's stuff like I put pizza crust in my butt or Garfield had pan buns.

30:44.640 --> 30:47.200
Yeah, no, but I think this is more interesting to talk about

30:47.200 --> 30:50.320
of whether we should start all sort of enforcing issues off policy

30:50.320 --> 30:54.160
because on any walk from point A to point B,

30:55.520 --> 30:56.960
no matter where you live,

30:56.960 --> 31:01.920
both rural and urban environments have their own sort of danger things.

31:01.920 --> 31:07.360
In an urban environment, you might step in like an old pile of soup

31:07.360 --> 31:09.040
that somebody just like dumped on the ground.

31:09.040 --> 31:13.200
But in a rural environment, you might actually step in a cow patty.

31:13.200 --> 31:17.520
And then I don't necessarily want you bringing the story of your walk

31:17.520 --> 31:19.920
into my home and sharing it with my floor.

31:20.480 --> 31:21.200
You know what I mean?

31:21.200 --> 31:22.320
Now that I'm thinking about this.

31:22.320 --> 31:25.600
And I'm not like a, I don't think I'm particularly germaphobic at all.

31:25.600 --> 31:30.800
It's just like you could bring anything from your journey into my place.

31:30.800 --> 31:33.680
And I'm walking on the floor on my bare feet because it's my zone.

31:33.680 --> 31:35.360
It's my little kingdom.

31:35.360 --> 31:35.920
You know what I mean?

31:35.920 --> 31:36.880
Am I the only one here?

31:36.880 --> 31:39.040
I feel like whenever someone,

31:40.640 --> 31:44.560
I never feel like it's an imposition when people ask me to remove my shoes

31:44.560 --> 31:46.720
because I always feel like, oh, thank God.

31:47.280 --> 31:50.800
Like finally I can get comfortable and really explore the space, right?

31:52.640 --> 31:54.160
So I would always prefer to take them off.

31:54.800 --> 31:58.160
That's why I like, you walk into a place, just anybody's house

31:58.160 --> 32:00.240
and they say, take your shoes off

32:00.240 --> 32:02.720
and they hand you a set of pajamas to change into.

32:02.720 --> 32:07.200
Okay, so you went a little bit much there.

32:07.200 --> 32:10.000
No, and then like you all just, they've spread pillows on the floor

32:10.000 --> 32:11.360
and everyone just takes a nap

32:11.360 --> 32:13.840
because this is apparently we're all children now

32:13.840 --> 32:16.480
and we can't wear our fucking shoes indoors.

32:16.480 --> 32:17.120
No, I'm just kidding.

32:17.120 --> 32:17.840
This sounds great.

32:17.840 --> 32:19.280
Cause I always wear funny socks.

32:19.280 --> 32:21.440
Okay, so but you did mean jokes then.

32:22.480 --> 32:24.000
It's like having a fourth brother.

32:25.200 --> 32:26.560
It's like you walk into the house

32:26.560 --> 32:27.760
and you fucking take your shoes off

32:27.760 --> 32:30.400
and they make you climb up a big tube and jump into a ball pit

32:30.400 --> 32:32.480
because it's apparently all big McDonald's Play Place.

32:32.480 --> 32:35.680
That was you just a minute ago, but you know this is true.

32:35.680 --> 32:36.960
Well, here's what I did Griffin.

32:37.680 --> 32:40.000
I started to zig, right?

32:40.000 --> 32:41.920
And then what I did was I zagged

32:41.920 --> 32:45.200
because and I'll go behind the zag here for a second.

32:45.200 --> 32:49.200
I realized that my funny joke might end up sounding mean

32:49.200 --> 32:51.600
towards cultures who are taking shoes off is the norm.

32:51.600 --> 32:52.000
Oh, I see.

32:52.000 --> 32:53.840
So I zagged right out of it

32:53.840 --> 32:56.400
and made it a thing where I'm actually on board with it.

32:56.400 --> 32:57.840
Sort of a corrective zag.

32:58.720 --> 33:00.400
This has been inside the zag.

33:01.040 --> 33:02.080
Here's what I like about this.

33:02.080 --> 33:03.600
I'm Peter Graves.

33:03.600 --> 33:06.160
Welcome to inside the zag.

33:06.160 --> 33:07.520
I like a lot about this.

33:07.520 --> 33:10.720
I think it's clean and good and respectful.

33:10.720 --> 33:13.920
I'm not gonna bring my shoes journeys story

33:13.920 --> 33:16.240
all over your home where your baby is like

33:16.240 --> 33:19.280
definitely like licking the floor 24 seven.

33:19.280 --> 33:19.840
You know what I mean?

33:20.880 --> 33:24.960
But also this also introduces the concept of toilet slippers

33:24.960 --> 33:27.360
which can be very, very exciting

33:27.360 --> 33:28.800
because you do need to put those on

33:28.800 --> 33:31.120
when you go into that room because who knows.

33:31.120 --> 33:33.760
I think we can all agree like no matter what

33:33.760 --> 33:35.360
anything goes in the bathroom.

33:35.360 --> 33:37.920
So you put these special shoes on

33:37.920 --> 33:40.240
and then people come out and it's like a conversation starter.

33:40.240 --> 33:42.800
I enjoyed wearing those toilet slippers

33:42.800 --> 33:43.680
that you had in there.

33:43.680 --> 33:45.680
They were fun and they were flirty and fashionable.

33:49.280 --> 33:51.360
Yeah, you convinced him

33:51.360 --> 33:53.920
I'm willing to take my shoes off from the house from now on.

33:53.920 --> 33:56.000
Now, I think to really drive this home.

33:56.000 --> 33:58.320
By the way, why the fuck did this get deleted?

33:58.320 --> 34:00.000
Who are yahoo?

34:00.000 --> 34:01.680
This is actually the most innocuous question

34:01.680 --> 34:03.440
we've ever had on this TV show.

34:03.440 --> 34:04.720
I know podcast.

34:04.720 --> 34:05.200
Sorry.

34:05.200 --> 34:07.040
What is yahoo owned by big?

34:07.040 --> 34:10.240
Is yahoo owned by big Nike by big Adidas?

34:11.040 --> 34:12.880
My big carpet wizards.

34:12.880 --> 34:13.840
Every all day.

34:13.840 --> 34:17.040
I dream about answering yahoo answers.

34:21.600 --> 34:23.360
That got him nice.

34:23.360 --> 34:25.440
It's just like I think this is dope

34:25.440 --> 34:28.320
and I think I'm gonna actually invest in a little cubby.

34:28.320 --> 34:30.000
I'm gonna invest in a shoe cubby

34:30.000 --> 34:31.120
and when my friends come over,

34:31.120 --> 34:33.840
I can have little nameplates for my friends.

34:33.840 --> 34:34.480
Hi, Justin.

34:34.480 --> 34:35.040
Hi, Bristol.

34:35.040 --> 34:36.240
This is your special cubbies.

34:36.240 --> 34:37.440
Put your shoes in the hole.

34:38.000 --> 34:39.760
You should take it one step further, Griffin.

34:39.760 --> 34:40.080
Okay.

34:41.440 --> 34:42.560
Special cubbies for shoes.

34:43.440 --> 34:45.840
Then special like silly socks

34:45.840 --> 34:48.080
with the non-skid slip on the bottom.

34:48.080 --> 34:49.360
Those will be an option, sure.

34:49.920 --> 34:51.440
So that way it's like they can

34:51.440 --> 34:52.160
because that's the thing.

34:52.160 --> 34:53.040
I have hardwood floors.

34:53.040 --> 34:54.960
I don't wanna brag, but I'm worried.

34:54.960 --> 34:57.680
Like people sometimes they have some sort of composite.

34:57.680 --> 34:59.280
Like some sort of composite.

34:59.280 --> 35:00.800
Are they real genuine?

35:00.800 --> 35:02.080
But I also rent.

35:02.080 --> 35:04.800
So listen, it's not a brag

35:04.800 --> 35:05.520
because it's not my house,

35:05.520 --> 35:08.480
but it's an old house, okay?

35:08.480 --> 35:11.200
But I'm worried about people's dress socks

35:11.200 --> 35:12.160
on the hardwood floor.

35:12.160 --> 35:14.320
So I wanna give them something where it's like,

35:14.320 --> 35:15.680
hey, they look like monster feet.

35:15.680 --> 35:16.160
You know what I mean?

35:16.160 --> 35:16.880
That kind of thing.

35:17.600 --> 35:19.600
Yeah, I think that defeats the purpose a little bit,

35:19.600 --> 35:21.200
but okay, I'm with you kind of,

35:21.200 --> 35:21.840
but not really.

35:21.840 --> 35:25.760
Like indoor shoes.

35:25.760 --> 35:26.260
Okay.

35:27.200 --> 35:28.560
So slippers.

35:28.560 --> 35:29.760
Yeah, that's what you've just described.

35:29.760 --> 35:31.200
You've just said indoor slippers.

35:31.200 --> 35:32.160
No, I'm sorry.

35:32.160 --> 35:34.320
Guys, I don't want them to slip around.

35:34.320 --> 35:36.080
I wanna give them Shurer foot.

35:36.080 --> 35:37.200
Stickers then.

35:37.200 --> 35:37.760
Stickers.

35:38.880 --> 35:39.840
Sticky indoor shoes.

35:40.400 --> 35:42.240
Hey everybody, get inside.

35:43.200 --> 35:43.760
Get aboard.

35:44.800 --> 35:46.160
Where are we going?

35:46.160 --> 35:50.240
We're sailing away from this commerce-free wasteland.

35:50.240 --> 35:52.480
I'm taking you to a sweet little island

35:52.480 --> 35:53.680
that I know about.

35:55.120 --> 35:56.800
It used to be called Bally High

35:56.800 --> 35:59.520
and now I've renamed it The Money Zone.

36:10.560 --> 36:13.200
Someone who can talk should probably sell them.

36:13.200 --> 36:13.520
All right.

36:15.600 --> 36:17.120
I'll do this first one

36:17.120 --> 36:20.480
because this first one is a good friend of mine named Harry,

36:20.480 --> 36:21.840
or specifically Harry's.

36:22.400 --> 36:25.120
What Harry's does is they send you razors

36:25.120 --> 36:26.560
and the razors are very, very good

36:26.560 --> 36:27.840
and they're very, very affordable

36:27.840 --> 36:29.520
and they're gonna give you a close, comfortable shave.

36:30.720 --> 36:33.120
You're talking about five German-engineered blades,

36:33.120 --> 36:34.800
talking about a lubricating strip,

36:34.800 --> 36:36.880
got a flex hinge there for a comfortable glide.

36:38.400 --> 36:39.760
It's a really good blade.

36:39.760 --> 36:42.720
I use mine pretty much exclusively now to shave my face

36:42.720 --> 36:46.000
and I get, I feel like I get a nice shave every time.

36:46.960 --> 36:49.840
And it was started by just two guys, Jeff and Andy,

36:49.840 --> 36:52.080
who were fed up with being overcharged for razors.

36:52.080 --> 36:54.080
So they cut out the middleman

36:54.080 --> 36:56.480
and now they just sell their own high-quality razors online

36:56.480 --> 36:57.520
and ship them directly to you

36:57.520 --> 36:59.520
for half the price of the leading brand.

36:59.520 --> 37:01.920
And they are so confident

37:01.920 --> 37:04.320
they want you to try their most popular trial set for free.

37:04.320 --> 37:06.960
It comes with a free razor handle of your choice,

37:06.960 --> 37:09.040
five-blade cartridge and shaving gel,

37:09.040 --> 37:10.320
and it's free when you sign up.

37:10.320 --> 37:12.480
You just pay a little fee for the razor.

37:12.480 --> 37:16.000
It's free for shipping and you get these good blades.

37:16.000 --> 37:17.520
So to redeem your free trial offer,

37:17.520 --> 37:19.920

37:19.920 --> 37:21.840

37:21.840 --> 37:25.520
Go get that skin, so soft, so smooth.

37:25.520 --> 37:28.640
I would like to tell you guys about my underpants.

37:28.640 --> 37:29.480
All right.

37:30.480 --> 37:31.320
They're great.

37:33.200 --> 37:34.880
They are wonderful, I'm wearing them right now.

37:34.880 --> 37:36.480
They are endowing me with the confidence

37:36.480 --> 37:39.200
to talk about me undies.

37:39.200 --> 37:40.640
Here's the thing, we've talked about me undies

37:40.640 --> 37:41.600
so many times in the show,

37:41.600 --> 37:43.120
maybe this is your first episode.

37:43.120 --> 37:46.920
Maybe you are just now getting into our show

37:46.920 --> 37:49.760
on episode 345.

37:49.760 --> 37:51.560
Gotta start somewhere, don't start at one.

37:51.560 --> 37:53.560
Start here, work backwards.

37:53.560 --> 37:56.920
Me undies is an amazing brand.

37:56.920 --> 37:59.520
I mean, like a concept.

37:59.520 --> 38:01.320
Family member at this point.

38:01.320 --> 38:04.720
At this point, their underpants are amazing.

38:04.720 --> 38:06.840
They're softer than soft.

38:06.840 --> 38:10.420
They not only have underpants for everybody,

38:10.420 --> 38:14.040
they also have sleep pants, T-shirt, it's incredible.

38:14.040 --> 38:17.880
Different styles, cool patterns, it's great.

38:17.880 --> 38:20.000
And it's the first thing you put on

38:20.000 --> 38:21.940
and it's the last thing you take off.

38:21.940 --> 38:24.320
And you're gonna, this is not a joke,

38:24.320 --> 38:25.720
it is not an exaggeration.

38:25.720 --> 38:27.920
When I put on a pair of me undies,

38:27.920 --> 38:30.240
like fresh out of the shower me undies,

38:30.240 --> 38:32.440
it feels like yes, I'm ready.

38:32.440 --> 38:34.400
It feels like yes.

38:34.400 --> 38:36.740
It feels like yes, it does.

38:36.740 --> 38:40.520
It feels like I'm agreeing to do something with myself

38:40.520 --> 38:42.200
that day.

38:42.200 --> 38:44.080
And if you're not ready for a subscription,

38:44.080 --> 38:45.960
that's totally cool.

I got a personal message here for Chambers and Daggley.

39:09.140 --> 39:09.980
And it's from.

39:09.980 --> 39:11.380
My favorite TNT show.

39:11.380 --> 39:12.940
And it's from Chris.

39:12.940 --> 39:15.660
Nobody has a favorite TNT show, so stop it.

39:16.900 --> 39:19.460
Mark Paul Gosler and.

39:19.460 --> 39:21.340
Mark Paul Glockosler.

39:21.340 --> 39:22.180
Jesus.

39:24.700 --> 39:25.940
Chris says to Chambers.

39:25.940 --> 39:28.900
One's a lawyer, the other's a lawyer.

39:28.900 --> 39:31.420
They practice law in a court.

39:31.420 --> 39:33.700
But a different kind, well it's the same branch of law.

39:33.700 --> 39:35.020
It's the same kind of law.

39:35.020 --> 39:35.860
They're part.

39:35.860 --> 39:38.780
But like, one's a little bit wackier.

39:38.780 --> 39:39.600
It's not wacky.

39:39.600 --> 39:40.440
Just a little bit, it's just a little bit.

39:40.440 --> 39:42.180
No, absolutely not.

39:42.180 --> 39:44.660
They're just regular lawyers and they're both lawyers

39:44.660 --> 39:47.120
and they're good at their jobs and they do their best.

39:47.120 --> 39:48.900
But they're not exceptional like house.

39:48.900 --> 39:50.900
They're just regular law guys.

39:50.900 --> 39:52.460
They're looking for love in the big,

39:52.460 --> 39:53.900
they're not looking for love.

39:53.900 --> 39:55.540
What are they doing?

39:55.540 --> 39:57.520
Are they single dads?

39:57.520 --> 39:59.260
No, they're not single, I'm just hearing

39:59.260 --> 40:01.220
they're not single dads at all.

40:01.220 --> 40:02.660
They're not single dads at all.

40:02.660 --> 40:03.500
There's no kids.

40:03.500 --> 40:04.340
What are they doing?

40:04.340 --> 40:06.540
They're going to, okay, so Dagleigh's going

40:06.540 --> 40:09.020
to the grocery store in this episode, everybody.

40:09.020 --> 40:10.300
This is Dagleigh.

40:10.300 --> 40:11.980
They didn't have a case this week?

40:11.980 --> 40:13.020
There's no, okay.

40:13.020 --> 40:13.860
All right.

40:13.860 --> 40:15.120
Every week it's a new case.

40:15.120 --> 40:15.980
Well, not always.

40:15.980 --> 40:16.820
Not always, yeah.

40:16.820 --> 40:18.860
Actually, sometimes there's paperwork.

40:18.860 --> 40:19.700
From this one.

40:19.700 --> 40:20.520
To do.

40:20.520 --> 40:21.360
And this one.

40:21.360 --> 40:24.240
TNT should just change their slogan to TNT, we know.

40:24.240 --> 40:25.300
We know, come on.

40:26.400 --> 40:27.740
We have a show in which one episode

40:27.740 --> 40:29.100
a character just goes to Trader Joe's

40:29.100 --> 40:31.180
and it's the whole episode, uncut.

40:31.180 --> 40:33.180
Uncut Trader Joe's visit.

40:33.180 --> 40:34.020
Okay, so.

40:34.020 --> 40:35.020
And he ends up not getting anything.

40:35.020 --> 40:35.860
No, he doesn't.

40:35.860 --> 40:36.700
They didn't have what they needed.

40:36.700 --> 40:38.220
He left his wallet at home.

40:38.220 --> 40:40.080
That's a good episode.

40:40.980 --> 40:41.820
That's a good episode.

40:41.820 --> 40:42.640
That's drama.

40:42.640 --> 40:43.480
TNT, we know drama.

40:43.480 --> 40:44.320
We have characters.

40:44.320 --> 40:45.140
We know drama.

40:45.140 --> 40:45.960
Okay, so this.

40:45.960 --> 40:46.800
We know drama, we've met him.

40:46.800 --> 40:48.440
Boy, gotta get this message out.

40:49.620 --> 40:51.980
This is from Chris to Chambers and Dagleigh.

40:51.980 --> 40:53.920
And Chris says, happy Blorf Day

40:53.920 --> 40:55.240
to my two Mabim Bam buddies.

40:55.240 --> 40:56.340
I miss the most.

40:56.340 --> 40:58.060
I wish we didn't live about as far

40:58.060 --> 40:59.660
as three people can in the US,

40:59.660 --> 41:01.740
but I'm glad we can still get together online

41:01.740 --> 41:03.880
to slowly deconstruct the English language

41:03.880 --> 41:06.580
into a series of unrecognizable sounds.

41:06.580 --> 41:08.360
Hope you both have great B-days

41:08.360 --> 41:12.480
and we get to play a bunch of Blabio Glambs soon and often.

41:12.480 --> 41:14.780
There's a lot of challenging sort of goof-em-ups

41:14.780 --> 41:15.840
on words in this one.

41:16.840 --> 41:20.220
And we got the timeframe pretty much right on this one.

41:20.220 --> 41:23.300
So happy Blorf Day, Chambers, and Dagleigh.

41:23.300 --> 41:27.460
And sorry we talked more about a fictional TNT show

41:27.460 --> 41:31.980
than we did about you, but kind of part of the course.

41:31.980 --> 41:34.860
Yeah, you knew the job was dangerous when you took it.

41:34.860 --> 41:37.900
I got a message for PV and it's from Apple Alligator.

41:37.900 --> 41:40.120
And it says, happy birthday and congratulations

41:40.120 --> 41:41.740
on finishing your thesis.

41:41.740 --> 41:43.460
I'm so proud of you.

41:43.460 --> 41:47.060
I love you and cannot wait to get some Jolly Pirate again.

41:47.060 --> 41:48.180
Aw, damn.

41:48.180 --> 41:52.180
Jolly Pirate donuts and gyros now sometimes.

41:52.180 --> 41:53.020
What?

41:53.020 --> 41:53.840
You wanna go in there?

41:53.840 --> 41:54.680
Yep.

41:54.680 --> 41:55.640
It even added it to the sign.

41:55.640 --> 41:58.740
It's the J.P. Deli.

41:58.740 --> 41:59.580
Oh, no.

41:59.580 --> 42:02.860
Featuring J.P. Deli starring donuts.

42:02.860 --> 42:04.860
And also gyros.

42:04.860 --> 42:07.100
I mean, the family that runs that place

42:07.100 --> 42:09.280
already kicked donuts ass, right?

42:09.280 --> 42:12.500
And so they needed a new challenge, I guess.

42:12.500 --> 42:13.680
Yeah, they've conquered donuts.

42:13.680 --> 42:14.820
They put them in a treasure chest,

42:14.820 --> 42:17.580
which makes them more appetizing and humanly possible.

42:17.580 --> 42:18.780
Yeah.

42:18.780 --> 42:21.360
Jesus, guys, it's 1.09 p.m. right where I am,

42:21.360 --> 42:22.700
and I have not eaten lunch yet.

42:22.700 --> 42:24.980
And we cannot talk more about donuts,

42:24.980 --> 42:25.820
or else I may actually kill you.

42:25.820 --> 42:29.720
It's 2.09 p.m. here, and it feels like 10, and I'm dying.

42:29.720 --> 42:30.560
Okay.

42:30.560 --> 42:32.100
The Max Fun Drive is coming up.

42:32.100 --> 42:33.020
Okay.

42:33.020 --> 42:34.140
Hey, everybody, it's Justin Mac.

42:34.140 --> 42:34.980
Yeah, that's how we start.

42:34.980 --> 42:36.700
That's how we start talking about the Max Fun Drive

42:36.700 --> 42:38.300
with a little pep and our staff.

42:38.300 --> 42:40.380
Can you just let me fucking get through the sentence?

42:40.380 --> 42:44.060
The Max Fun Drive is coming up, so fucking get ready.

42:44.060 --> 42:45.000
Brace your ass,

42:45.000 --> 42:47.600
because it's gonna kick your ass right down your teeth.

42:47.600 --> 42:49.140
And it's gonna be really good.

42:49.140 --> 42:50.660
And it's the best shows of the year,

42:50.660 --> 42:53.060
and all the shows are gonna be fucking rock out

42:53.060 --> 42:56.300
and rock hard, and you're gonna love every episode

42:56.300 --> 42:57.140
of every one.

42:57.140 --> 42:59.020
These beach bodies are ready.

42:59.020 --> 43:03.820
Come crave the sweaty crevices of these hard abs

43:03.820 --> 43:04.660
Oh my God.

43:04.660 --> 43:06.820
in the podcast abs, and it's coming.

43:06.820 --> 43:09.820
The Max Fun Drive doesn't have vertigo, but I do.

43:09.820 --> 43:12.860
And now it's time to listen to it next week.

43:12.860 --> 43:14.460
Catch it.

43:14.460 --> 43:16.540
So it kicks off on the 20th, and it runs for two weeks,

43:16.540 --> 43:18.140
and we love you all so much,

43:18.140 --> 43:20.560
because you all come out for us every year,

43:20.560 --> 43:21.980
and we appreciate it, and so like-

43:21.980 --> 43:22.820
Rock hard.

43:22.820 --> 43:24.860
It's very rock hard, and if you're a new listener,

43:24.860 --> 43:27.400
and you like our stuff, and you wanna help support us,

43:27.400 --> 43:29.420
this is the best time to do it,

43:29.420 --> 43:31.800
and you get great gifts if you do so,

43:31.800 --> 43:35.060
and we'll have bonus episodes for literally every show

43:35.060 --> 43:36.620
that we make.

43:36.620 --> 43:39.420
And bonus episodes through the past.

43:39.420 --> 43:41.300
To the past, too, so yeah.

43:41.300 --> 43:42.580
If you're a new MBMBAM listener,

43:42.580 --> 43:44.580
and you get on board as a donating member,

43:44.580 --> 43:47.500
there will be fucking hours, and hours, and hours,

43:47.500 --> 43:49.520
and hours, and hours of content waiting for you.

43:49.520 --> 43:51.780
For our show, and all the other shows,

43:51.780 --> 43:55.020
I'm very partial to the Adventure Zone bonus episodes

43:55.020 --> 43:56.780
we've done that have been really, really fun.

43:56.780 --> 43:59.100
So yeah, it starts the 20th, runs for two weeks.

43:59.100 --> 44:00.820
We'll do some really good episodes for you,

44:00.820 --> 44:04.060
and have some bonus shit, and tell you how to support us,

44:04.060 --> 44:07.020
and get some cool gifts for being a donor,

44:07.020 --> 44:09.860
and thank you all so much for how much you've supported us

44:09.860 --> 44:12.020
in the past, because you've allowed us to do

44:12.020 --> 44:13.440
some really, really fun stuff.

44:13.440 --> 44:15.380
So thank you all so much.

44:15.380 --> 44:16.980
I have a problem.

44:16.980 --> 44:20.980
Last time we recorded, it was two weeks ago, or three?

44:20.980 --> 44:23.340
No, two, yes. Who knows?

44:23.340 --> 44:25.220
It was before you left the Earth,

44:25.220 --> 44:26.660
and moved to Mother C. It was before I left.

44:26.660 --> 44:27.980
Before you got on nautical time,

44:27.980 --> 44:29.780
where you measured time in clicks.

44:31.140 --> 44:33.140
I created a great recurring bit,

44:33.140 --> 44:34.540
where I basically just got an opportunity

44:34.540 --> 44:36.740
to talk about Guy Fieri, and see what's going on with him.

44:36.740 --> 44:37.580
Yeah.

44:37.580 --> 44:38.740
And I can't remember what I called it.

44:38.740 --> 44:41.020
At first, I thought it was Fieri Walk With Me,

44:41.020 --> 44:43.460
but that was just something hilarious

44:43.460 --> 44:45.940
that I said a long time ago, in a different life,

44:45.940 --> 44:47.820
before the C Mother took me.

44:47.820 --> 44:50.040
And then I thought it was Guy in the Sky,

44:50.040 --> 44:51.420
but that doesn't make any sense.

44:51.420 --> 44:53.280
No, I don't think that was it.

44:53.280 --> 44:54.120
I'm looking at the-

44:54.120 --> 44:56.620
I think it was Guy Focused.

44:56.620 --> 44:57.660
Guy Focused.

44:57.660 --> 44:59.620
No, Guy Another Day.

44:59.620 --> 45:01.300
Guy Another Day, I think it was.

45:01.300 --> 45:02.140
Yes.

45:02.140 --> 45:04.460
And then I have an important Guy Another Day update,

45:04.460 --> 45:05.500
although I kinda wanna,

45:05.500 --> 45:08.940
this is called Guy Another Day slash Fieri Walk With Me,

45:08.940 --> 45:10.580
because I don't wanna lose either one of those.

45:10.580 --> 45:11.820
They're both very good.

45:11.820 --> 45:12.660
Okay.

45:12.660 --> 45:14.420
When I was still, this is from All Listener.

45:14.420 --> 45:15.460
Travis didn't credit them.

45:15.460 --> 45:16.780
It's from Evan.

45:16.780 --> 45:18.140
It's Evan G.

45:18.140 --> 45:19.240
Evan G.

45:19.240 --> 45:20.300
While I was still in college,

45:20.300 --> 45:22.420
they opened a Guy Fieri restaurant on campus.

45:22.420 --> 45:24.540
In December of that year, I think,

45:24.540 --> 45:28.940
Guy Fieri himself came to my college for a book signing.

45:28.940 --> 45:29.780
He wrote a book?

45:29.780 --> 45:30.620
On a table-

45:30.620 --> 45:31.440
What?

45:31.440 --> 45:32.280
He's sorry.

45:32.280 --> 45:33.460
He's published?

45:33.460 --> 45:37.140
On a table behind the one guy was using to sign the book,

45:37.140 --> 45:40.460
there was a giant ice bucket with a single Heineken in it.

45:40.460 --> 45:41.500
At Guy's command,

45:41.500 --> 45:44.820
one woman would bring the ice bucket to his signing table.

45:44.820 --> 45:47.100
He would take a little sip from the Heineken

45:47.100 --> 45:49.660
and put it back in this ice bucket.

45:49.660 --> 45:51.340
The woman responsible for the bucket

45:51.340 --> 45:53.860
would then immediately move it back behind him

45:53.860 --> 45:56.060
and bring it back and forth whenever Guy wanted

45:56.060 --> 45:57.940
to drink his one single Heineken.

45:59.500 --> 46:00.540
This is a lot.

46:00.540 --> 46:03.160
It's a lot to take in.

46:03.160 --> 46:07.500
It's a lot to take in.

46:07.500 --> 46:09.500
I don't wanna waste any Heine.

46:09.500 --> 46:11.000
Just one at a time, please.

46:12.380 --> 46:15.960
So one thing I will say is, okay, I will say this.

46:15.960 --> 46:19.440
In Guy, in Mr. Fiaty's defense,

46:19.440 --> 46:22.200
sometimes when you go into situations like this,

46:22.200 --> 46:26.080
the setup of the situation is not of your own creation,

46:26.080 --> 46:29.320
but just happens to be whatever the person

46:29.320 --> 46:32.500
putting the thing together thought would be good.

46:32.500 --> 46:36.360
So you end up in situations that feel like weird.

46:36.360 --> 46:40.140
Like we had people when we were shooting our TV show

46:40.140 --> 46:44.640
that would just like run bottles of water up to us sometimes.

46:44.640 --> 46:46.540
And then we would say like, oh, we could have gotten

46:46.540 --> 46:48.880
our own water, but thank you very much for doing this.

46:48.880 --> 46:52.520
So you don't always like, but we would never demanded water

46:52.520 --> 46:55.200
until later on in shooting.

46:55.200 --> 46:57.640
We got a little bit more, really big heads.

46:57.640 --> 47:00.160
But like, maybe he didn't craft this.

47:00.160 --> 47:02.480
I will say though, that had someone put us

47:02.480 --> 47:05.740
in this exact scenario, we probably would have said,

47:05.740 --> 47:07.080
this isn't a great look.

47:07.080 --> 47:09.680
I would prefer you did not with this.

47:10.560 --> 47:12.840
Sorry, on the subject of Guy Fieri being published,

47:12.840 --> 47:16.000
of course he has many cookbooks under his belt.

47:16.000 --> 47:17.200
And I'd like to read- Seven.

47:17.200 --> 47:18.280
Yeah, I'd like to read some of them

47:18.280 --> 47:23.280
because they include Diners, Drive-ins and Dives.

47:23.520 --> 47:24.360
What's the full title?

47:24.360 --> 47:26.360
Diners, Drive-ins and Dives,

47:26.360 --> 47:29.240
an all American road trip with recipes, okay?

47:29.240 --> 47:31.320
More Diners, Drive-ins and Dives,

47:31.320 --> 47:34.480
a drop top culinary cruise through America, that's fun.

47:35.560 --> 47:36.640
Diners- Oh, sorry, Gervin.

47:36.640 --> 47:38.760
Sorry, Gervin, it's through America's finest

47:38.760 --> 47:40.040
and funkiest joints.

47:40.040 --> 47:42.060
You're right, sorry, Travis, it got cut off for me.

47:42.060 --> 47:43.760
Here's another one, Diners, Drive-ins and Dives,

47:43.760 --> 47:46.880
the funky finds in Flavortown, America's classic joints

47:46.880 --> 47:50.080
and killer comfort food, just a lot, just a lot, sir.

47:50.080 --> 47:53.640
And then sort of, we start paring down just a little bit.

47:53.640 --> 47:57.560
Guy on Fire, 130 recipes for adventures in outdoor cooking,

47:57.560 --> 47:59.100
that's a good one.

47:59.100 --> 48:03.280
And then we get Guy Fieri Family Food,

48:03.280 --> 48:08.160
125 real deal recipes, kitchen tested, home approved,

48:08.160 --> 48:09.100
is a good one.

48:09.100 --> 48:11.220
And then we keep going down and down and down,

48:11.220 --> 48:15.160
sort of the word slide to fun and food with Guy Fieri.

48:15.160 --> 48:20.080
And then finally, we just sort of land on Guy Fieri Food

48:20.080 --> 48:21.720
is the name of this book.

48:21.720 --> 48:26.040
Well, sorry, Gervin, subtitled Cooking It, Living It,

48:26.040 --> 48:27.160
Loving It.

48:27.160 --> 48:29.200
Guy Fieri Food.

48:29.200 --> 48:32.340
And then just the next one's just gonna be like Guy Food.

48:32.340 --> 48:37.240
And then finally, G-Slop is the final one,

48:37.240 --> 48:39.200
the final entry.

48:39.200 --> 48:40.840
These are all available on Amazon.

48:40.840 --> 48:43.520
You can get the, I'm sorry, six books.

48:43.520 --> 48:47.060
And then the seventh is the book and DVD bundle.

48:47.060 --> 48:50.280
And just a word of warning, Guy Fieri Food,

48:50.280 --> 48:53.280
Cooking It, Living It, Loving It, isn't a cookbook.

48:53.280 --> 48:57.360
I think it's like a dark and gritty detective novel.

48:57.360 --> 48:58.920
With himself as the detective,

48:58.920 --> 49:00.920
and I would read that so fucking hard.

49:00.920 --> 49:01.760
Are you kidding me?

49:01.760 --> 49:03.160
Yeah.

49:03.160 --> 49:06.120
Private Guy, Private Guy, Private Guy.

49:06.120 --> 49:07.920
Private Guy, excellent job.

49:07.920 --> 49:10.000
It's in food.

49:10.000 --> 49:13.240
Private Dick would be just, I guess.

49:13.240 --> 49:16.320
Listen, listen, I don't know that.

49:16.320 --> 49:18.160
I shouldn't say these things.

49:18.160 --> 49:19.640
No, he has a very secret dick.

49:19.640 --> 49:20.480
I understand.

49:20.480 --> 49:22.200
I've never seen Guy, hey, raise your hands

49:22.200 --> 49:23.840
if you've seen Guy Fieri's dick.

49:23.840 --> 49:26.080
I bet it's a pretty small club.

49:26.080 --> 49:28.480
From scratch, it's the unauthorized history

49:28.480 --> 49:31.120
of the Food Network, and I'm just entered the guy,

49:31.120 --> 49:32.800
the dawn of Guy.

49:32.800 --> 49:35.340
And they said that there's a whole section

49:35.340 --> 49:37.520
about how he was a little green when he started

49:37.520 --> 49:39.720
in that he didn't really know what a diner was.

49:39.720 --> 49:42.840
He thought it was like code for a hamburger restaurant

49:42.840 --> 49:44.680
because he didn't grow up around a lot of diners.

49:44.680 --> 49:48.460
And also when he were filling one of the early episodes,

49:48.460 --> 49:52.080
a chef referred to chicken soup as Jewish penicillin,

49:52.080 --> 49:54.640
and Guy Fieri just lost his fucking mind

49:54.640 --> 49:56.920
because he thought the chef made that joke up.

49:56.920 --> 49:59.400
So he was just like losing it

49:59.400 --> 50:02.420
at this hilarious, hilarious joke.

50:03.680 --> 50:08.400
So that's been Guy in the Sky slash Fieri Walk With Me

50:08.400 --> 50:11.000
slash Guy Another Day.

50:11.000 --> 50:12.760
All right, Justin, do the next question.

50:12.760 --> 50:14.380
You got it, brother.

50:15.300 --> 50:18.280
So my friend, we'll call him Oswald,

50:18.280 --> 50:20.260
has been telling us for the last decade or so

50:20.260 --> 50:22.960
that he is horribly deathly allergic to red meat

50:22.960 --> 50:24.700
and that his throat will close up

50:24.700 --> 50:27.140
and he will die if he consumes any.

50:27.140 --> 50:29.040
The other day, I walked into the room

50:29.040 --> 50:32.120
and he was chomping down on some chips and queso.

50:32.120 --> 50:35.840
The kind of, I know this is a typo

50:35.840 --> 50:37.040
which we don't normally highlight,

50:37.040 --> 50:38.840
but the question asker did type

50:38.840 --> 50:40.680
the kind of quest with beef in it.

50:40.680 --> 50:43.760
And I know they mean queso, but I prefer that.

50:43.760 --> 50:45.560
The kind of quest with beef in it.

50:45.560 --> 50:48.400
When I dive into a bowl of hot peppered cheese,

50:48.400 --> 50:50.520
it is kind of a quest for me.

50:50.520 --> 50:53.580
And the reward for that quest is going to be toilet time.

50:55.360 --> 50:58.160
I checked the container he got the queso in

50:58.160 --> 51:03.160
and it told me it was, in fact, true beef.

51:03.360 --> 51:04.280
Season three.

51:04.280 --> 51:09.280
With Mark Paul Gosler and Paul Giamatti.

51:11.080 --> 51:11.920
One's a cop.

51:11.920 --> 51:12.760
The other's a cop.

51:13.960 --> 51:15.920
They're both by the book.

51:15.920 --> 51:17.920
Now, are we doing a true blood thing

51:17.920 --> 51:20.280
or a true detective thing or both?

51:20.280 --> 51:22.920
Paul Giamatti's a vampire.

51:22.920 --> 51:25.240
Mark Paul Gosler is also a vampire,

51:25.240 --> 51:26.900
but very straight laced.

51:26.900 --> 51:28.700
Super cool.

51:28.700 --> 51:31.040
Okay, so in fact, he was eating true beef.

51:31.040 --> 51:34.040
He isn't dead and it has me wondering,

51:34.040 --> 51:36.040
what the fuck is going on?

51:36.040 --> 51:38.000
And how would I go about confronting Oswald

51:38.000 --> 51:40.180
about this weird thing?

51:40.180 --> 51:42.240
That's from beefing in Baltimore,

51:42.240 --> 51:44.380
a name that Travis made up.

51:44.380 --> 51:46.920
Everybody's gotta get the drop on someone.

51:46.920 --> 51:50.280
Like everyone's, it's an exciting feeling, I know.

51:50.280 --> 51:52.120
When you think in your mind

51:52.120 --> 51:54.120
that you have an opportunity to get the drop,

51:54.120 --> 51:56.760
it's so, it's exciting and I get that.

51:56.760 --> 51:58.040
But I don't understand necessarily

51:58.040 --> 52:02.720
why you need to like put your buddy on blast.

52:02.720 --> 52:04.520
I don't know why this is like, oh boy,

52:04.520 --> 52:06.160
time to really put Oswald in his place.

52:06.160 --> 52:08.440
Here, okay, here's why,

52:08.440 --> 52:13.440
just to give the question asker a little bit of credit.

52:13.660 --> 52:16.320
This isn't like someone saying,

52:16.320 --> 52:19.360
oh, I'm gluten intolerant.

52:19.360 --> 52:21.080
And when you really press them about it,

52:21.080 --> 52:24.280
like they just don't wanna eat bread or whatever,

52:24.280 --> 52:25.220
but they're just making that.

52:25.220 --> 52:29.260
Why would someone be like, yeah, red meat, it will kill me.

52:29.260 --> 52:30.100
Okay.

52:30.100 --> 52:33.440
Like why would you say that if it weren't true?

52:33.440 --> 52:34.960
Maybe you live in a fairly small town

52:34.960 --> 52:37.640
and your only two restaurant options are Sizzler and BW3s.

52:37.640 --> 52:39.400
And of course this person wants to go to BW3s

52:39.400 --> 52:40.680
and get those good hot chicken wings.

52:40.680 --> 52:43.820
And so this is their thing.

52:43.820 --> 52:45.680
But that's just a lie.

52:45.680 --> 52:46.780
Okay.

52:46.780 --> 52:49.180
Well, maybe they're not allergic to ground beef.

52:49.180 --> 52:52.000
And I don't know, there's a lot of different explanations.

52:52.000 --> 52:54.880
Do you think once they grind it, sorry,

52:54.880 --> 52:57.160
they grind it and then it's no longer an allergen?

52:57.160 --> 52:58.320
Is that what you're suggesting?

52:58.320 --> 53:01.080
Yeah, it changes sort of the, it lets out whatever,

53:01.080 --> 53:05.000
you know, carbon dioxide is just sort of released

53:05.000 --> 53:06.080
when you grind up the meat

53:06.080 --> 53:08.240
and the carbon dioxide goes up into the atmosphere

53:08.240 --> 53:10.680
and makes the ozone layer, I think or something.

53:10.680 --> 53:14.480
This is one of the problems with 20 grifting.

53:14.480 --> 53:15.680
We didn't really think through it,

53:15.680 --> 53:18.200
but a lot of people started grifts in 2015,

53:18.200 --> 53:20.840
but we didn't necessarily have an off ramp

53:20.840 --> 53:22.440
for all those grifts, you know?

53:22.440 --> 53:25.360
Some of you might, we told you the con was off,

53:25.360 --> 53:26.640
but like for many of you,

53:26.640 --> 53:28.980
the con may still will indeed be on.

53:28.980 --> 53:29.820
Yeah.

53:29.820 --> 53:31.720
And you just don't know how to get out of it.

53:31.720 --> 53:33.560
It wasn't like January 1st, 2016,

53:33.560 --> 53:35.720
people are like, should all the acquaintance be,

53:35.720 --> 53:38.520
I can eat red meat by the way, got you motherfucker.

53:38.520 --> 53:40.920
And days of auld lang syne.

53:40.920 --> 53:42.560
That would have been, by the way,

53:42.560 --> 53:44.240
you didn't need us to help you find that.

53:44.240 --> 53:45.260
That would have been amazing.

53:45.260 --> 53:46.100
That would have been really good.

53:46.100 --> 53:46.920
And you all should have done that.

53:46.920 --> 53:49.020
If you didn't do that, then it's on you.

53:49.020 --> 53:50.540
I would like to paint you a picture

53:50.540 --> 53:52.480
that makes this all make sense to me.

53:52.480 --> 53:54.040
It's so clear to me now.

53:54.040 --> 53:55.840
All of the elements have been uncovered

53:55.840 --> 53:57.640
and I can see everything.

53:57.640 --> 53:59.400
I see how it all connects.

53:59.400 --> 54:00.560
What happened was,

54:00.560 --> 54:05.440
someone who did not know Oswald's allergy

54:05.440 --> 54:08.360
bought him some of the most delicious queso

54:08.360 --> 54:09.820
they had ever had.

54:09.820 --> 54:12.940
And Oswald accepts it as a gift

54:12.940 --> 54:15.140
because Oswald was too polite to say,

54:15.140 --> 54:16.560
are you trying to kill me?

54:16.560 --> 54:20.480
And there it sat in Oswald's fridge.

54:20.480 --> 54:23.640
And on the same day this queso was about to expire,

54:23.640 --> 54:27.280
Oswald realized their EpiPen was also about to expire.

54:27.280 --> 54:31.840
And they thought, well, let's not let either go to waste.

54:31.840 --> 54:36.540
And so in one hand, chips, in left hand, EpiPen.

54:36.540 --> 54:38.400
Okay, so you get a good dunk.

54:38.400 --> 54:42.880
And it would probably be a pretty fucking good dunk,

54:42.880 --> 54:43.960
I think.

54:43.960 --> 54:46.480
Like if you need to fucking like,

54:46.480 --> 54:47.880
if after consuming it,

54:47.880 --> 54:51.840
you have to also just pop in the bezoar

54:51.840 --> 54:54.580
to like sort of nullify the meat poisons.

54:54.580 --> 54:57.740
It's probably like a pretty good bite of food, I bet.

54:59.960 --> 55:01.880
A lot of people pay a lot of money

55:01.880 --> 55:04.680
to go to like a restaurant that is certified

55:04.680 --> 55:06.280
to serve you fugu fish.

55:06.280 --> 55:09.960
And this is like this experience just for like a whopper.

55:09.960 --> 55:11.020
You know what I mean?

55:12.480 --> 55:15.160
How much of the whopper would you risk eating

55:15.160 --> 55:16.040
before you put the EpiPen?

55:16.040 --> 55:19.040
I would try to cram basically the whole kit and caboodle.

55:19.040 --> 55:19.880
As much as I could.

55:19.880 --> 55:20.720
Yeah.

55:20.720 --> 55:23.400
Why would you lie about being?

55:24.900 --> 55:25.740
Maybe they don't know.

55:25.740 --> 55:26.560
Maybe they don't know.

55:26.560 --> 55:27.680
Maybe they were, fucking,

55:27.680 --> 55:31.700
Rachel went to the doctor when she was like seven

55:31.700 --> 55:34.160
and they were like, she was sick with something.

55:34.160 --> 55:35.000
And they're like, oh, well,

55:35.000 --> 55:37.800
it's because you can't ever have a chocolate.

55:37.800 --> 55:40.000
And so for like fucking 14 years,

55:40.000 --> 55:42.140
like Halloween's no chocolate, no candy.

55:42.140 --> 55:43.440
Like she would go and go trick or treating.

55:43.440 --> 55:46.400
And I guess just throw it all in the dumpster or something.

55:46.400 --> 55:47.700
And then like when she was 20, they're like,

55:47.700 --> 55:48.880
oh, nope, guess we wanged it.

55:48.880 --> 55:49.720
You can have chocolate

55:49.720 --> 55:51.280
and you could have had chocolate this whole time.

55:51.280 --> 55:53.480
And maybe this person was told they can't have red meat.

55:53.480 --> 55:55.400
So they just didn't eat red meat for a long time.

55:55.400 --> 55:58.040
This is a great, you have great news for them.

55:58.040 --> 55:59.080
Great news.

55:59.080 --> 56:00.360
Beef it up.

56:00.360 --> 56:02.120
Go beef crazy.

56:02.120 --> 56:04.640
This is, you get to be the messenger

56:04.640 --> 56:07.200
for probably the best news this person will ever receive

56:07.200 --> 56:10.160
in their entire life, which is go have a beef party.

56:10.160 --> 56:11.920
You've earned it.

56:11.920 --> 56:13.200
Do you think there could be something

56:13.200 --> 56:16.160
in the melted cheese that like neutralizes the toxins?

56:16.160 --> 56:17.800
Oh, Jesus, Travis.

56:17.800 --> 56:20.020
Yes, definitely.

56:20.020 --> 56:20.960
Jesus, Travis, of course.

56:20.960 --> 56:21.960
I'm a scientist.

56:21.960 --> 56:23.680
No, yes, you are though.

56:25.800 --> 56:28.520
There's a tick called the Lone Star Tick

56:28.520 --> 56:29.760
that if it bites you,

56:29.760 --> 56:31.960
you can develop an allergy to red meat.

56:31.960 --> 56:33.360
Horrible news.

56:33.360 --> 56:34.200
Thank you for that one.

56:34.200 --> 56:35.180
I've never heard such a thing.

56:35.180 --> 56:37.840
So keep, I guess, I guess I just said that

56:37.840 --> 56:38.760
so you would know it.

56:38.760 --> 56:40.760
So keep your head on a fucking swivel, I guess.

56:40.760 --> 56:42.640
And be sure to interview ticks

56:42.640 --> 56:44.600
to make sure they're not that kind

56:44.600 --> 56:46.960
because that would sure be the pits, huh?

56:46.960 --> 56:47.800
You know what?

56:47.800 --> 56:48.620
Allergies are weird though.

56:48.620 --> 56:49.680
Allergies can come and go.

56:49.680 --> 56:50.520
You never know.

56:50.520 --> 56:52.880
Oh, wait, hold on, hold on, Justin, hold on.

56:52.880 --> 56:53.720
Griffin, sit back.

56:53.720 --> 56:56.720
This is Justin's tight five on allergies.

56:56.720 --> 56:57.560
Hold on, let him go.

56:57.560 --> 56:58.380
Okay, here we go, Justin.

56:58.380 --> 56:59.220
Sorry, go nuts.

56:59.220 --> 57:00.060
Let me just tell you guys a little something

57:00.060 --> 57:02.080
that I co-host a medical history podcast called Salvo.

57:02.080 --> 57:03.440
So I'm half a doctor pretty much.

57:03.440 --> 57:07.120
And let me just say that like refuse to have allergies.

57:07.120 --> 57:08.480
This is what I'm saying to you.

57:08.480 --> 57:12.880
Do not let yourself be bound by your allergies.

57:12.880 --> 57:14.360
Just refuse to have them.

57:14.360 --> 57:15.780
I used to be allergic to cats

57:15.780 --> 57:18.840
and I wanted a sweet cat of my own, of my very own.

57:18.840 --> 57:19.880
You know what I did?

57:19.880 --> 57:22.280
I just decided to not be allergic anymore.

57:22.280 --> 57:24.020
And today I'm here to tell you

57:24.020 --> 57:25.720
that I'm not allergic to cats anymore.

57:25.720 --> 57:29.040
And I cured myself from my allergies by inspiration.

57:29.040 --> 57:30.760
I'm not gonna lie to you.

57:30.760 --> 57:31.760
A lot of people lie to you

57:31.760 --> 57:34.480
and say you can cure your allergies with diet

57:34.480 --> 57:36.120
and different things like that

57:36.120 --> 57:38.180
or crystals or whatever, herbs.

57:38.180 --> 57:43.160
I love every time we take one step closer to having a cult.

57:43.160 --> 57:44.600
I love it.

57:44.600 --> 57:47.120
It makes me feel like we're finally doing something.

57:47.120 --> 57:49.240
How many cults started as a joke

57:49.240 --> 57:50.840
and then people just kept coming

57:50.840 --> 57:53.200
and then they're like, I guess we need guns.

57:53.200 --> 57:57.400
Cause this is getting very, this got very real.

57:57.400 --> 57:58.440
There's 30 of us.

57:58.440 --> 57:59.280
I guess we need guns.

57:59.280 --> 58:01.280
We should get guns.

58:01.280 --> 58:03.620
Can I do one last yahoo real quick?

58:04.620 --> 58:06.080
We're running pretty long.

58:06.080 --> 58:09.200
Oh my God, my desk is tilted 45 degrees sideways.

58:09.200 --> 58:11.540
Justin, we've only been recording for 20 minutes.

58:11.540 --> 58:12.380
Yeah, I know what you're talking about.

58:12.380 --> 58:14.080
Don't fuck with me right now, please.

58:14.080 --> 58:14.920
It's not like this.

58:14.920 --> 58:17.720
I just had to change my clock on my computer

58:17.720 --> 58:20.040
cause it was three hours slow.

58:20.040 --> 58:20.880
Oh geez.

58:20.880 --> 58:21.720
Oh God.

58:21.720 --> 58:22.800
Real quick, this is a level 9,000

58:22.800 --> 58:24.020
yahoo juju Davenport joint.

58:24.020 --> 58:25.040
So you know it's gonna be good.

58:25.040 --> 58:28.320
It's from yahoo answers user dedicated to evolution

58:28.320 --> 58:31.920
who asks, when you go to the bathroom in a movie theater,

58:31.920 --> 58:35.600
can you ask a stranger what you missed?

58:35.600 --> 58:38.040
Now let's pretend that run P is an app that doesn't exist

58:38.040 --> 58:39.840
and hasn't solved this problem for us.

58:39.840 --> 58:42.120
But when I read this, I guess they're talking about

58:42.120 --> 58:43.480
just you pop back into the theater

58:43.480 --> 58:44.960
and you sit down next to somebody who's like,

58:44.960 --> 58:45.800
hey, what happened?

58:45.800 --> 58:47.240
And I think that's unacceptable.

58:47.240 --> 58:48.320
You do that shit in the draft house

58:48.320 --> 58:49.920
and you get sent the fuck home.

58:50.920 --> 58:52.920
I think there could be an attendant.

58:52.920 --> 58:55.040
This is the only sort of bathroom attendant

58:55.040 --> 58:57.000
sort of situation that I would be cool with

58:57.000 --> 58:59.200
where you go in, you use the potty

58:59.200 --> 59:00.440
and then you go and you're washing your hands.

59:00.440 --> 59:01.280
And while you're washing your hands,

59:01.280 --> 59:02.720
you're like, okay, so what did I miss?

59:02.720 --> 59:04.440
And say you were seeing a rival

59:04.440 --> 59:07.480
and it's just like Amy Adams and Hawkeye,

59:07.480 --> 59:09.560
they had a conversation in the dark.

59:09.560 --> 59:10.400
All right, cool.

59:10.400 --> 59:11.920
Thank you.

59:11.920 --> 59:12.960
I do wanna point out.

59:12.960 --> 59:14.760
I love this, but I do wanna point out

59:14.760 --> 59:16.440
this would require a human being

59:16.440 --> 59:19.600
to know concurrently what's happening

59:19.600 --> 59:22.800
in every movie at the same time.

59:22.800 --> 59:23.640
Yeah, no, they would memorize.

59:23.640 --> 59:24.560
What are you seeing?

59:24.560 --> 59:25.680
You're seeing Logan.

59:25.680 --> 59:27.400
Okay, the 745 showing.

59:27.400 --> 59:29.720
So right now, all right.

59:29.720 --> 59:30.560
Yeah.

59:30.560 --> 59:31.400
Okay, let me think about it.

59:31.400 --> 59:33.680
Let me play it in my mind palace.

59:33.680 --> 59:36.120
And okay, I think I'm pretty sure Professor X

59:36.120 --> 59:38.640
and Wolverine just had a conversation in the dark.

59:38.640 --> 59:40.440
Yeah, I would much prefer they would.

59:40.440 --> 59:42.680
Why is it always that?

59:42.680 --> 59:44.840
Cause half of every movie that comes out

59:44.840 --> 59:46.080
and I've been watching a lot of movies

59:46.080 --> 59:47.600
cause I've just been consuming a lot of content

59:47.600 --> 59:50.920
cause I live at home forever now.

59:50.920 --> 59:52.240
It's just half of all movies.

59:52.240 --> 59:54.320
It's just conversations in the dark now.

59:54.320 --> 59:55.920
And I saw a rival and it was like,

59:55.920 --> 59:59.600
most of that movie was just people having dark room convos.

59:59.600 --> 01:00:00.480
So.

01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:04.280
Have you guys also gotten very aware of movies being,

01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:05.720
as long as we're talking about this,

01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:06.560
since you've had babies,

01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:08.680
have you become very aware of movies

01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:11.240
that are unable to properly mix sound and dialogue?

01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:13.520
Oh my God in heaven.

01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:16.480
It's just fucking Amy Adams is like, I don't know.

01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:19.200
I don't know how to have a communication with these aliens.

01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:21.840
And Jeremy Renner's like, yeah, I know, it's weird, isn't it?

01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:24.160
Just shouting and yelling at Amy Adams.

01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:26.960
There's a space explosion.

01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:27.800
Yeah.

01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:29.360
I've been rewatching West Wing

01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:32.840
and every episode ends like the most dramatic

01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:35.280
and everyone's like, yeah, we're going to war.

01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:38.600
Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:40.560
Blazing, Twin Peaks is the worst about it.

01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:44.600
Twin Peaks is like very quiet, like Agent Dale Cooper.

01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:47.840
And then we did solve the mystery.

01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:50.000
And then like the sound of the devil.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:50.840
Yeah.

01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:53.280
Blah, this is screaming.

01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:54.720
It's like, well, this is pretty spooky,

01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:56.760
but mainly because I have to watch it with a toddler now.

01:00:56.760 --> 01:00:57.760
Thank you, David.

01:00:58.600 --> 01:01:01.200
I think it'd be better if the usher in the bathroom

01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:02.720
just pulled open his vest

01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:04.720
and he had a small screen in there

01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:06.960
and it was just sinked to wherever you left off.

01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:09.920
That would be better and more believable, I think, to me.

01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:11.920
If you could just pull open his vest

01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:14.640
and there was a screen for you to continue watching the film.

01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:15.760
This is a thing that I've actually,

01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:18.040
in live theaters, I've seen before,

01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:19.800
that one, there's a screen out in the lobby,

01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:22.180
but also I've seen or heard, rather,

01:01:22.180 --> 01:01:25.120
they pipe the sound through the bathroom.

01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:27.080
So while you're in the bathroom,

01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:29.440
you can still hear the play going on.

01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:31.640
See, I could have used this when we first,

01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:33.320
you remember when we first saw Hamilton

01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:36.680
and I very much, very almost nearly did shit my pants

01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:37.720
during it,

01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:38.920
because I did not want to miss a second

01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:40.320
of our friend Len's good play.

01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:43.000
And so, I just, He worked very hard on it.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:44.760
He worked really, really hard on it.

01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:49.360
And so like, by the time Battle Yorktown rolled around,

01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:52.000
my world was almost turned upside down.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:55.140
And I was very much, My underwear was turned inside out.

01:01:55.140 --> 01:01:59.720
The shorts turned inside out.

01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:03.120
But I was very much like, okay, yeah,

01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:07.020
can we please just beat the British already?

01:02:07.020 --> 01:02:08.760
Go, do it.

01:02:08.760 --> 01:02:11.040
Here's machine guns.

01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:12.640
Here's machine guns, just go.

01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:15.560
We got to sneak up on them and reconnoitre the hills.

01:02:15.560 --> 01:02:17.240
And then we're going to come up with a plan.

01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:20.440
No, just shoot them up, please.

01:02:20.440 --> 01:02:21.960
I don't want to be the first person

01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:26.560
to ever shit their pants at Hamilton, please.

01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:28.920
You wouldn't have been Griffin, don't worry.

01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:31.280
Please hurry up.

01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:33.440
Mr. Washington, I'm not sure we can do it.

01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:35.960
You can, trust you on this one.

01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:37.320
And then we won the war.

01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:39.060
Oh, thank God, time for your intermission.

01:02:39.060 --> 01:02:41.640
Now, here's what we did after the war.

01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:45.360
Please, please, please, please, God, please.

01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:47.560
No, come on, please.

01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:51.760
This has been our comedy podcast,

01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:54.400
my brother, my brother, and me.

01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:57.320
If you have some free time,

01:02:57.320 --> 01:03:00.640
we have so many delightful offerings for you.

01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:02.920
I guested on Court Appointed,

01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:06.880
which is a legal show explaining the law.

01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:11.880
I guested, it was sort of a co-branded episode

01:03:11.900 --> 01:03:14.440
with another show I do, Sawbones.

01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:19.020
And it was about HIPAA and patient privacy.

01:03:19.020 --> 01:03:20.280
That show's called Court Appointed.

01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:21.480
You can find it on iTunes.

01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:24.680
Also, the Grifster and I did something really fun.

01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:28.040
We appeared on a YouTube show called Drawfee.

01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:31.360
It's D-R-A-W-F-E-E.

01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:34.440
And we helped create the hottest new board game.

01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:36.680
And it's really fun as we sort of created it

01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:39.720
with the Drawfee fellas.

01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:42.840
They drew our dumb board game idea,

01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:46.080
which is actually a really sick board game idea, by the by.

01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:50.700
But just check YouTube for Drawfee and you'll find it.

01:03:50.700 --> 01:03:52.200
As long as you're on YouTube,

01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:57.060
I also, my friend and co-host of Trends Like These, Brent,

01:03:57.060 --> 01:04:00.160
has made a party game called Use Your Words.

01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:04.480
And me and Tybee and some friends and Brent played it

01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:06.120
when he was in town visiting me.

01:04:06.120 --> 01:04:07.840
And we filmed the whole thing

01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:10.040
and he did some Q and A's in there.

01:04:10.040 --> 01:04:13.040
So you can see us play the game and try it out.

01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:15.800
Just go to his YouTube channel, Brentlefloss,

01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:17.920
and you can find it there.

01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:18.960
It was super fun.

01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:19.920
It's coming out soon.

01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:21.400
Use your words.

01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:23.860
And he hasn't asked me to plug this or anything.

01:04:23.860 --> 01:04:26.480
I'm just very proud of him and of the product.

01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:27.400
And it's really good.

01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:29.820
And of course, you can also check out

01:04:29.820 --> 01:04:32.840
my film review series, Carry On.

01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:33.920
Oh, Jesus.

01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:35.640
Still stuck at episode two.

01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:37.000
I need to record episode three.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:38.880
It's hard to get over that hump, man.

01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:39.720
It really is.

01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:41.840
What was episode two?

01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:43.320
Episode two was Copper Mountain,

01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:45.880
a two-hander with Jim Carrey and Alan Thicke

01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:47.700
that contains very little story.

01:04:47.700 --> 01:04:50.760
And it's mostly, it's actually called

01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:52.920
Copper Mountain Club Med Adventure,

01:04:52.920 --> 01:04:54.360
or Club Med Experience.

01:04:54.360 --> 01:04:56.000
Are you shitting me?

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:56.820
I am not.

01:04:56.820 --> 01:05:00.520
It is both movie and infomercial for Club Med.

01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:04.040
It contains nine different musical numbers

01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:06.600
in a 45-minute long made-for-TV movie.

01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:08.020
Oh, boy.

01:05:08.020 --> 01:05:09.900
It is a real treat.

01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:12.600
You can watch all our shit at McElroyShows.com.

01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:13.860
We have all our podcasts and stuff there.

01:05:13.860 --> 01:05:14.700
You can also go to-

01:05:14.700 --> 01:05:15.520
I put Carry On?

01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:16.360
I don't know.

01:05:16.360 --> 01:05:17.200
You should.

01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:18.220
I think maybe once you get to three apps,

01:05:18.220 --> 01:05:19.960
you can put it on McElroyShows.com.

01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:20.800
Yeah.

01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:21.640
I'm really close.

01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:25.680
Actually, a listener sent me the next four movies.

01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:27.720
So I have them all sitting next to me.

01:05:27.720 --> 01:05:28.720
Well, don't please.

01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:30.000
Don't spoil what they're gonna be

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:31.880
or talk about Carry On anymore.

01:05:31.880 --> 01:05:32.720
Okay.

01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:36.080
This is a film-by-film review of Jim Carrey's career.

01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:39.120
It's a very exciting new property.

01:05:39.120 --> 01:05:40.360
You can also go to MaximumFun.org

01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:42.240
and check out all the great shows on MaximumFun.org.

01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:44.160
And we're gonna be talking a lot about Maximum Fun

01:05:44.160 --> 01:05:46.400
over the next couple of weeks during the Max Fun Drive,

01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:50.280
which kicks off Monday, March 20th and runs for two weeks.

01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:52.720
And we're so happy to be a part of this network

01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:55.680
and I'm so grateful to all of you for helping support it.

01:05:55.680 --> 01:05:57.960
I also wanna thank John Roderick and the Long Winters

01:05:57.960 --> 01:05:58.880
for the use of our theme song

01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:01.720
as a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

01:06:01.720 --> 01:06:03.840
Juice, you got to hang out on that big, beautiful ocean

01:06:03.840 --> 01:06:05.680
with John Roderick.

01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:09.360
Yes, never enough time, but he's a solid dude as always.

01:06:09.360 --> 01:06:10.920
He's the best dude.

01:06:10.920 --> 01:06:11.960
Anything else?

01:06:11.960 --> 01:06:13.400
Yeah, we also should say, one,

01:06:13.400 --> 01:06:15.280
we have a TV show on see-so.com.

01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:16.760
If you haven't already checked that out.

01:06:16.760 --> 01:06:18.440
They're constantly, like every Monday,

01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:20.040
putting up new bonus content.

01:06:20.040 --> 01:06:21.960
The deleted scenes, or was it the bloopers?

01:06:21.960 --> 01:06:25.240
The bloopers for episode two is 17 minutes long.

01:06:25.240 --> 01:06:26.560
It's a lot.

01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:28.880
But, so check that out, see-so.com.

01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:31.880
And then also, we're gonna be in Portland this weekend

01:06:31.880 --> 01:06:33.640
doing a show. Oh shit, yeah, fuck.

01:06:33.640 --> 01:06:35.680
I can't believe that's now.

01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:37.000
So if you're gonna be at the show

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:38.160
and you want us to do a question,

01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:40.640
make sure you email it to us with Portland Show

01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:41.880
in the subject line.

01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:45.520
And just to be clear, we didn't organize this show,

01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:47.360
so we're not sure about like meet and greet

01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:48.600
or anything like that.

01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:50.120
So we can't promise anything,

01:06:50.120 --> 01:06:52.980
but we are gonna have posters made at the show.

01:06:54.080 --> 01:06:55.200
Well, they'll be made before.

01:06:55.200 --> 01:06:56.700
They're not gonna be like printers running

01:06:56.700 --> 01:07:00.180
while we do our unique brand of comedy up on stage.

01:07:00.180 --> 01:07:01.020
Yeah.

01:07:01.020 --> 01:07:02.340
And that's done for us by Emily,

01:07:02.340 --> 01:07:05.120
who is at Corrupted Jim on Twitter.

01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:05.960
They're really great.

01:07:05.960 --> 01:07:06.800
They're really great. I'm very excited.

01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:07.800
Yeah, I can't wait.

01:07:07.800 --> 01:07:08.900
You want that final?

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:11.080
Hell yeah.

01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:12.800
Sent in by a couple folks, actually.

01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:15.440
Level9000, YajuJuju Davenport, and Christopher Lockhart.

01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:16.280
Thank you both.

01:07:16.280 --> 01:07:20.640
It's from Yahoo Answers user, Stevan, asks,

01:07:21.580 --> 01:07:25.360
will the Loch Ness monster get into Christian heaven?

01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:26.680
Yes!

01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:27.520
Yes!

01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:28.360
Yes!

01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:30.560
When he was Justin McElroy.

01:07:30.560 --> 01:07:31.480
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:32.760
I'm Griffin McElroy.

01:07:32.760 --> 01:07:34.000
This has been My Brother, My Brother, Me.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.300
Kiss your dad square on the lips.

01:07:36.300 --> 01:07:41.300
Hey, good girls, do you wanna just say hey, I wanna?

01:07:41.300 --> 01:07:44.620
Do you wanna just say hey, I wanna?

01:07:53.580 --> 01:07:55.500
Maximumfun.org.

01:07:55.500 --> 01:07:57.620
Comedy and culture, artist owned.

01:07:57.620 --> 01:07:58.820
Listener supported.

01:07:59.940 --> 01:08:00.780
Hey, Ben.

01:08:00.780 --> 01:08:01.600
What's that, Adam?

01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:03.660
Maximum Fun has asked us to make a new promo,

01:08:03.660 --> 01:08:04.940
and I think the best way to do it

01:08:04.940 --> 01:08:06.700
is to tell people what our show's about.

01:08:06.700 --> 01:08:07.940
Oh, that's pretty easy.

01:08:07.940 --> 01:08:10.380
The Greatest Generation is a hybrid podcast

01:08:10.380 --> 01:08:12.100
that guarantees you a good night's sleep

01:08:12.100 --> 01:08:15.660
with a combination of both latex foam and memory foam.

01:08:15.660 --> 01:08:18.020
No, it's actually a show that allows you

01:08:18.020 --> 01:08:20.940
to skip the post office by printing out your own postage.

01:08:20.940 --> 01:08:23.760
No, it is a podcast that allows you to design websites

01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:26.100
by using award-winning templates.

01:08:26.100 --> 01:08:27.860
Ben, it is most definitely not that.

01:08:27.860 --> 01:08:30.180
The Greatest Generation is a Star Trek podcast

01:08:30.180 --> 01:08:31.660
by two guys who are a little bit embarrassed

01:08:31.660 --> 01:08:32.980
to have a Star Trek podcast.

01:08:32.980 --> 01:08:35.860
New episodes come out every week on Maximum Fun

01:08:35.860 --> 01:08:40.860
or wherever you download podcasts.
