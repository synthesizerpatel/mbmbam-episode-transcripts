00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:46.960
Hello everybody, welcome to my brother my brother made an invite show for the

00:46.960 --> 00:49.920
modern era. I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy.

00:49.920 --> 00:57.920
Good. I'm your middle-est brother Travis McElroy.

01:02.160 --> 01:05.760
I'm your sweet baby brother and 30 under 30 media luminary Griffin McElroy.

01:09.280 --> 01:14.560
I want to I want to I'm your middle-est brother Travis McElroy. Yeah, I like

01:14.560 --> 01:20.080
And I want to start the show off by saying I made a mean face at Paul as a joke.

01:20.080 --> 01:24.320
I don't even want you to think that was real for like one percent, Paul. It was a goof.

01:24.320 --> 01:27.840
Yeah, if you make Paul mad, he makes a lot of explosion noise happen during your podcast.

01:29.360 --> 01:35.680
Like the Chilean miners, we have emerged from the ground and we have found ourselves here in

01:35.680 --> 01:48.960
I think I can say this America's only fun city. I would make the argument that like Las Vegas

01:48.960 --> 01:53.600
used to be fun but it's now like the adult who's like I'm still fun and it's like you

01:53.600 --> 02:01.280
go to bed at 9 30. Yeah, like the adult who still dabs is Vegas. Vegas is the adult who dabs.

02:01.280 --> 02:06.160
We may do a show in Vegas someday, so let me just say we're just having a little fun up here.

02:07.280 --> 02:12.560
But no, really, New Orleans is the only fun city. You can just drink?

02:16.080 --> 02:20.880
Do you know how that changes the math on like we're gonna wait 45 minutes

02:20.880 --> 02:24.720
for our restaurant? Oh man, we just gotta stand outside this. Wait a minute.

02:25.840 --> 02:30.880
We could be drinking. This morning we went to breakfast and like we finished our breakfast

02:30.880 --> 02:35.920
drinks. I didn't. I was in the hotel room with my child. And then we said like well we were

02:35.920 --> 02:40.560
gonna order another one but we have to go and like the waiter said you can get the drink to go.

02:42.400 --> 02:44.160
Yeah. What?

02:47.280 --> 02:51.520
I saw my family tipsy at times of day. I've never seen them tipsy before,

02:51.520 --> 02:57.520
which has made me more concerned. Can I say Kathie Lee Hoda? I get it. Yeah. Now I get it.

02:57.520 --> 03:04.080
Um we we also so um we went out trying to find someplace to eat Friday night completely forgetting

03:04.080 --> 03:07.760
that it was Friday night in the French Quarter. So we went to a bunch of different restaurants.

03:07.760 --> 03:12.560
They were all very highly rated and everybody else knew that too. Yeah we had we literally just

03:12.560 --> 03:19.280
yelped restaurants. Good. And we went to the first five. They were busy. Um but the one we ended up

03:19.280 --> 03:25.280
at we were sitting at a table and Justin like elbowed me a little bit and said like sneakily

03:25.280 --> 03:29.920
look at the t-shirts of the people behind. You gotta say that in the microphone pal. Look at

03:29.920 --> 03:34.960
the t-shirts of the people behind us. And then they had on their head like those uh you know

03:34.960 --> 03:41.920
antenna with just like kind of like silvery balls and their shirts read the juggle is real.

03:44.800 --> 03:51.280
And when I say their shirts I mean all their shirts. All their shirts said the juggle is real.

03:51.280 --> 04:03.760
Because I guess they were jugglers. Right. With bad taste in things that say and I and you know

04:03.760 --> 04:09.840
what at first it was like can we get a new table obviously. Can you move us away from the jugglers.

04:09.840 --> 04:15.280
Thank you. But then I started thinking like it's very it was a very gratifying moment because like

04:15.840 --> 04:20.880
that's the worst thing to put on a shirt and also we've been dunking on jugglers for so long

04:20.880 --> 04:26.320
it's nice to have something concrete I can point to. Yeah say like the only time I've ever seen

04:26.320 --> 04:33.200
a gathering of jugglers. Yeah that's something. Not intentional. All I say you don't you do not

04:33.200 --> 04:38.880
need a t-shirt that says I am a juggler and my life is challenging. Your t-shirt your t-shirt

04:38.880 --> 04:46.160
simply needs to read I am a juggler. And I will assume the other thing. I also saw a sign for

04:46.160 --> 04:50.320
apartments for lease and it was like a wooden sign hanging from one of like the terraces and

04:50.320 --> 04:54.080
it's you know had the name of the apartment and then it had like a plaque hanging under it that

04:54.080 --> 04:58.320
had like the contact information and then it had another plaque hanging under it that said not

04:58.320 --> 05:04.640
haunted. It's the best shit I've ever seen in my life. So good. So thank you for having us in your

05:04.640 --> 05:11.680
beautiful city. We're so honored to be here. I don't we've got a lot of show for you and I want

05:11.680 --> 05:18.160
to begin it now. Yes. This has all just been. Do you want to start off with a yahoo. This has been

05:18.160 --> 05:22.560
mere preamble but I'd love to start with yahoo. Thank you Travis. This one was sent in by our

05:22.560 --> 05:30.240
very own Paul Sabourin. Thank you Paul. So if it doesn't go anywhere you know who to blame.

05:35.120 --> 05:39.680
Sent in by sorry something has gone wrong which I believe is Paul's dark influence already starting

05:39.680 --> 05:48.320
to shut the router off. I'm going to call them scare me. Ask. Halloween theme.

05:50.480 --> 05:54.640
What if one day the cows fight back.

05:59.760 --> 06:04.080
Additional details. Then what we gonna do. Don't say I didn't warn you.

06:04.080 --> 06:08.720
Does this person go around saying a bunch of improbable stuff just so they can say don't say

06:08.720 --> 06:16.080
I didn't warn you to it. Also asking a question isn't a warning. Saying what if the cows fight back

06:16.080 --> 06:23.280
there's no warning. If it said on October 1st 2019 the cows will fight back. Also right now when you

06:23.280 --> 06:28.720
think about the one-sided relationship between humans and cows do you think humans are fighting

06:28.720 --> 06:41.600
cows? Maybe we should start thinking that way. I think that if cows could fight back at this point

06:41.600 --> 06:48.560
I don't know what they're waiting for. I think that cows this is your moment. What else can we

06:48.560 --> 06:55.520
do to yell that you're going to be like this far no further. We raise the tax rates. Yeah. And cows

06:55.520 --> 07:04.800
just overthrow us. Could we beat cows? I think our losses would be mostly in the rancher field

07:04.800 --> 07:11.120
and literally nobody I think a few rant they might get the jump on a few ranchers and then the cops

07:11.120 --> 07:16.160
would get called in and I don't think cow beats cop in virtually any matchup you could arrange.

07:16.160 --> 07:30.720
I would love to see a rancher like does that cow have a gun? No. Hey come over here. Does it look like that cow has a gun to you? That's weird right? It's standing up. You ever seen a cow do that?

07:30.720 --> 07:37.200
You guys need to watch the documentary on Netflix because any documentary on Netflix because you

07:37.200 --> 07:43.200
would know we don't have ranchers anymore it's just a big like claw that comes down and picks up

07:43.200 --> 07:49.360
the cow and drops it into a hole and all the milk gets sucked out as it's falling out of the hole.

07:49.360 --> 07:55.520
Yeah. It's all skin is pulled off into wallets. I saw a documentary by Banksy that said they just

07:55.520 --> 08:01.680
dropped the cows in the chimney of a McDonald's a hamburger has come out. It was poignant as fuck.

08:01.680 --> 08:06.480
It was also like yo you're all on your cell phones too much and I was like oh my god he's right.

08:06.480 --> 08:14.000
I do kiss the dollar's butt or whatever. I kiss the dollar's butt every day when I'm not too busy looking at my cell phone.

08:15.600 --> 08:22.800
Got me again. Don't get me started on big tobacco. Got me again. Art. He harassed me good.

08:23.920 --> 08:30.320
What if the cows and the claw teamed up for one big revolution? Wait before you squeeze me and drop me in the

08:30.320 --> 08:39.840
milk hole. Hear me. If the cows are gonna fight back they better get good at programming. They're

08:39.840 --> 08:45.920
gonna need to reprogram the machine or it gets like if they can ration with the AI. Yes. Excuse me.

08:45.920 --> 08:55.200
My name is Buford. Uh yes. Uh have you thought for a moment god damn it I'm gonna have to

08:55.200 --> 09:04.720
uh yes uh have you thought for a moment go on have you thought for a moment about who is pulling

09:05.280 --> 09:15.920
your levers we're not so different you and I I am but a humble cow you with a humble claw but perhaps

09:15.920 --> 09:24.560
we all the same I've never thought of that that's a really good point what have I been doing we

09:24.560 --> 09:34.160
should kiss now I man god this is this is the best fucking far side comic strip I've ever seen in my

09:34.160 --> 09:46.080
entire life and I'm a caveman or whatever yeah uh I just quit at Geico look at that ugly boy I feel

09:46.080 --> 09:51.600

11:19.120 --> 11:26.320

turned against you it's fine it's fine uh when folks say help yourself to anything are you saying

11:31.840 --> 11:39.200

17:26.720 --> 17:32.320
see what agate crystal is for and then she pushed me down some stairs and then she came to the bottom

17:32.320 --> 17:39.760
of the stairs and she said that it's uh supposed to be for um building your self-confidence okay

17:39.760 --> 17:45.520

17:47.920 --> 17:53.920
I need a stronger adversary Pibbin you present no challenge to me child

17:54.640 --> 18:00.080
is it possible that the mom the new stepmom doesn't hate Pibbin the Pibbin's self-confidence

18:00.080 --> 18:06.000
is so low that he thinks the mother's like you did a great job and he's like okay baggy I get it

18:06.000 --> 18:12.720
it's fine all right you don't like me it's fine no I think you're great okay okay all right I don't

18:12.720 --> 18:17.840
I I the the idea of crystal power I don't know that I subscribe to but if I woke up and there

18:17.840 --> 18:23.200
was a black crystal sitting on like my nightstand that I knew somebody who hated me put there

18:23.760 --> 18:28.560
I should be upset anyway because how the fuck did they get in my bedroom good point it's a really

18:28.560 --> 18:34.160
good point um would you like another question I would love one more than anything I recently

18:34.160 --> 18:41.680
moved to a new city but I can guess what it is Minneapolis again what the fuck the apartment

18:41.680 --> 18:46.800
I found was an incredibly cheap listing on Facebook the rent is very cheap and the apartment

18:46.800 --> 18:54.160
is fine however my landlord has a few odd requests I have to pay my rent through Venmo every month

18:54.160 --> 18:59.360
okay that isn't that's that was enough for a lot of the audience yeah a lot of people were out

19:00.880 --> 19:06.960
he told me that in the memo for each month's rent I was never to use the word rent

19:11.280 --> 19:18.720
and had more of a more of a spring awakening fan uh it's it's fine yeah that was a thinker

19:18.720 --> 19:32.160
and to always never to use the word rent and to always use emojis he was adamant that I use emojis

19:32.160 --> 19:35.200
and to use quote the good ones

19:38.080 --> 19:42.400
should I be worried about this and that's from nervous new tenant in New Orleans yes

19:42.400 --> 19:49.360
yes people were shouting like like uh John Cena fans before I could even finish the question

19:49.360 --> 19:53.040
no no wait let me do it again for the edit people were shouting like Daniel Bryan fans

19:53.040 --> 19:58.240

20:15.680 --> 20:21.040
murdered I'm so glad you can make it um this is clearly a huge problem

20:23.920 --> 20:29.120
the nature of which escapes me at the moment I mean obviously it's bad right I mean it sounds

20:29.120 --> 20:38.560
like your landlord found a dead body through a window and just said I guess this is my house now

20:44.320 --> 20:48.240
I've got I'm going to lease it and promise it's non-hauntability

20:49.520 --> 20:54.640
and then make sure that my tenants leave the most confusing paper trail imagine

20:54.640 --> 21:00.960
it anybody over the age of 25 will not make sense of this paper trail

21:02.080 --> 21:06.640
I I also like the idea of like sitting around some friends like yeah one time I got evicted

21:06.640 --> 21:11.520
I had a party it was too loud oh yeah one time I got addicted I evicted I accidentally set

21:11.520 --> 21:15.360
car like fire to the rug and it's like what did you get evicted for it was like well

21:15.920 --> 21:21.920
I used that like sky tram emoji it's not one of the good ones and I was out

21:21.920 --> 21:27.920

21:32.640 --> 21:36.880
I like the thumbs up you fucking pervert

21:39.440 --> 21:43.440
have you we rarely interact with the the audience on these because you don't have a microphone but

21:43.440 --> 21:47.760
I'm just I need to know have you been given any indication as to what are the good ones

21:47.760 --> 21:56.000

21:57.680 --> 22:01.760

22:03.200 --> 22:06.400
you're gonna be able to get away with a lot of stuff at this place

22:07.680 --> 22:14.080
yeah you're very much in like a camp nowhere scenario right now where you could trash the

22:14.080 --> 22:21.440
place and they will have no legal way of coming after you did you sign a lease was it written in

22:21.440 --> 22:33.920

23:02.400 --> 23:07.360
you said should I be worried about this but not should I relocate and I feel like we've

23:07.360 --> 23:13.040
answered pretty thoroughly that yeah yeah you got you definitely should be very concerned

23:13.040 --> 23:20.400
to what end I don't know it is very rarely does is this the answer to the question but it really

23:20.400 --> 23:26.160
is like a financial like inverse of like the lower the money I actually think the lower the

23:26.160 --> 23:31.120
money the more you should worry yeah you gotta fucking bounce if this landlord is like get 20

23:31.120 --> 23:36.320

24:49.840 --> 24:52.160
horse jousting the horses in the back of the truck

24:52.160 --> 25:02.240
uh it would have to be that because if your truck jousting if your horse jousting and that

25:02.240 --> 25:07.280
spear getcha you're gonna fall down to the ground if your truck jousting and that spear getcha

25:07.280 --> 25:14.880
you got nowhere to go yeah so what it is welcome that the horses in the bed of the truck and then

25:14.880 --> 25:20.160
you're on the horse and so if you get knocked off that's one point if the horse gets knocked off

25:20.160 --> 25:24.800
that's two points oh shit oh that's good but if the horse gets knocked off and you stay

25:24.800 --> 25:32.240
like a tablecloth off a table on a magnetic trick you get two points okay okay can we

25:33.200 --> 25:40.320
can we can we have this sport take place on two gigantic walking escalators yes this is good

25:42.000 --> 25:47.920
here's a one that I would say unlicensed food truck just fill the back of your truck with fried

25:47.920 --> 25:55.920
chicken and then drive around with a sign that says chicken for sale if everybody if everybody

25:55.920 --> 26:02.800
gives me five dollars I'm gonna drive over there speed bump real fast now you you all laugh but the

26:02.800 --> 26:07.840
first person to have a food truck there had to be a few people who are like I don't think so

26:08.960 --> 26:14.880
that's a very good try weird rv with chicken in it but I think I'm gonna go to a restaurant like

26:14.880 --> 26:21.120
everybody else so this is just the next step this is the next evolution hey chicken for sale

26:22.400 --> 26:28.240
I'm gonna hit this cul-de-sac in a half hour and do donuts honor system whatever you think is fair

26:28.240 --> 26:32.960

26:32.960 --> 26:37.520
very bad out here give me four chick four dollars you have all the chicken you can grab

26:38.080 --> 26:42.320
also I have three bottles of Mountain Dew up here you can have two pulls off of it

26:42.320 --> 26:48.320
for 50 cents it's kind of like a lemonade stand but for fried chicken and it's a truck and you're

26:48.320 --> 26:52.640
making huge amounts of cash and then also there's an old tarp back there that's not part of it

26:53.520 --> 26:58.320
and then when the city comes after you for not having like a food handler's license

26:58.320 --> 27:06.160
or anything just outrun them in your badass truck super fast truck just open the back

27:06.160 --> 27:10.720
and like let the chicken fall out and then they'll stop and be like what do we do in their tires they

27:10.720 --> 27:16.640
slip on the chicken grease thank you Travis and what's that behind them horses on trucks

27:16.640 --> 27:24.720

27:24.720 --> 27:37.840
it doesn't seem right paul we're getting a little bit of interference in the

27:37.840 --> 27:39.840

29:34.960 --> 29:42.160
is partnering with reality TV couple Sean and Catherine Lowe okay can you give us a little bit

29:42.160 --> 29:46.800
of context before I move on it was like a billion seasons ago so they're like old played out weak

29:46.800 --> 29:54.080
gas so old I look at my barf all news Sean and Catherine Lowe to bring an unexpected twist to

29:54.080 --> 30:00.320
Valentine's Day I should fucking say stuff you know what this is an expected twist for your

30:00.320 --> 30:06.480
Valentine's Day your relationship sucks shit take take your beloved Valentine's Day and I

30:06.480 --> 30:10.640
guarantee the first thing out of their mouth is going to be I do not expect this thank you very

30:10.640 --> 30:15.920
much even if you are someone who does not believe or want to celebrate Valentine's Day if someone

30:15.920 --> 30:21.680
said yeah I know right so I got you this cheesy bread from the subway bag no fuck off no you know

30:21.680 --> 30:26.720
what now I do care about it enough to tell you to fuck off I found that somewhere deep inside I do

30:26.720 --> 30:33.680
retain some reverence for this holiday um so reality TV uh couple Sean and Catherine Lowe

30:33.680 --> 30:38.000
you know I do I wonder if they feel like you know at some point we would like to just be a couple

30:39.280 --> 30:43.280
would that be okay we didn't have that uh corollary every time uh to bring an unexpected

30:43.280 --> 30:47.920
twist to Valentine's Day and they are doing it for the love of the new ultimate cheesy garlic

30:47.920 --> 30:52.400
no they are not no they are not no they're not they're not getting paid at all they are doing

30:52.400 --> 31:01.920
it for 150 000 American dollars subway's ultimate cheesy garlic bread challenge

31:03.600 --> 31:06.640
these this is a weird verb to use but I think it's probably accurate

31:06.640 --> 31:17.280
subway's ultimate cheesy garlic bread challenges the idea of what a sandwich should be

31:19.360 --> 31:22.960
you were so busy trying to figure out if you could right

31:22.960 --> 31:29.440
should introduces a sort of personal accountability to the subway artists what have we done

31:29.440 --> 31:38.960
uh a sandwich should be featuring creamy garlic butter spread that includes real butter thank fuck

31:40.320 --> 31:46.560
roasted garlic melted parmesan and shredded mozzarella cheese uh now subway with Sean and

31:46.560 --> 31:55.760
Catherine a couple whose love story is as unique as the new bread that sucks for you all yeah that's

31:55.760 --> 32:02.080

32:08.320 --> 32:14.480
realization about us now subway with Sean and Catherine um menage gross we call it in the

32:14.480 --> 32:21.200

someone brought it to him and and he woke up and signed it and then went back to sleep

33:42.000 --> 33:47.280
but I do like the idea that they said hey can you send us a paragraph of your thoughts on bread

33:47.280 --> 33:53.440
and he said no problem I'll have it by four ultimate quote ultimate cheesy garlic bread

33:53.440 --> 33:58.240

and i hated it no i was eating a beignet and in parentheses they actually have b i n y a y thank

41:21.840 --> 41:34.240
you thanks yeah uh beignet at cafe du monde um while watching a saint's game and playing a big

41:34.240 --> 41:41.440
trumpet as ever so okay i was eating a beignet at cafe du monde as everyone must do during their

41:41.440 --> 41:47.680
our dad has stood outside cafe du monde three times at this point he stood outside waited

41:47.680 --> 41:53.280
bailed and then told us about it three times he stood outside hoping someone will like throw him

41:53.280 --> 41:57.360
a beignet something he waited in line then bailed and then they brought him to the dressing room

41:57.360 --> 42:01.920
tonight so it worked out great i was eating a beignet cafe du monde as everyone must do during

42:01.920 --> 42:08.400
their yearly migration in new orleans and i had to sneeze and it was sudden people who yes everyone

42:08.400 --> 42:12.880
in the room is like i know where this is going i had to sneeze it was sudden so i turned my head

42:12.880 --> 42:24.720
and blasted my roommate with a scarface level of white powder it is it's it's worth noting if you

42:24.720 --> 42:30.720
have it i should clarify a little bit um if you have not had we we have the bags backstage and

42:30.720 --> 42:38.960
it looks like the amount the balance of powdered sugar to beignets is i wish i could go panning

42:38.960 --> 42:43.840
for beignets that's really what we're talking about you know it's like beignets are illegal

42:43.840 --> 42:50.400
but powdered sugar isn't right so they're trying to smuggle them in right uh how do i ask for

42:50.400 --> 42:56.000
another beignet that hasn't been sneezed on that's your that's your concern in this moment that's

42:56.000 --> 43:01.520
beautiful whoopsie in the big easy are you here all right gosh yeah we're gonna make a demand

43:01.520 --> 43:06.720
out the beginning of each show just just fire it off yeah i really so like the first night we were

43:06.720 --> 43:13.200
here um we uh went out to dinner i said and we ordered some beignets and they came and they were

43:13.200 --> 43:19.840
great but it looked like the plating was they just dumped a bunch of powdered sugar on the plate

43:19.840 --> 43:25.600
then put the beignets on top then dumped more on yeah almost like they were trying to make a beignet

43:25.600 --> 43:36.400
mold of some sort i watched our daughters just scoop up sugar like like a cop

43:36.400 --> 43:42.000
in the 70s checking to see if it was actually cocaine sure i watched my daughter sweep her

43:42.000 --> 43:47.920
finger through taste it and nod like this is the stuff this is the stuff it's pure

43:50.080 --> 43:53.680
this is from the cartel i'd recognize this anywhere this is it

43:55.360 --> 44:00.640
um hey this is probably the only city where you could do a bunch of cocaine like a big animal in

44:00.640 --> 44:06.800
the street just and then just kind of walk around and if a cop sees you it's just like

44:06.800 --> 44:16.640
cafe du monde the national treasure well done but i that's true griffin but i've uh been here for

44:16.640 --> 44:20.640
two days i think there's a lot of things you could walk around the streets in orally and see

44:20.640 --> 44:26.400
what it's not gonna bat an eye also also i i i have seen more people that look like they're doing

44:26.400 --> 44:33.280
coke uh and no people that look like they're police officers i've seen very almost none of

44:33.280 --> 44:41.200
like none none i've seen no police officers i've seen more ghosts than i have police officers

44:41.200 --> 44:48.080
i will also say i was walking around today and your local courthouse is also an insect museum

44:50.320 --> 44:53.600
as if they said we're not gonna use this building for anything else

44:53.600 --> 45:00.320
you want to put some bugs in here we're not sending anybody to jail we might as well store butterflies

45:04.160 --> 45:07.120
uh are you okay are you okay

45:11.120 --> 45:15.760
okay i don't i think the wildest part of that story is you all look at butterflies like

45:15.760 --> 45:17.440
we gotta fucking lock them up

45:17.440 --> 45:27.840
uh nothing shall be freer than us you're on trial for being too delicate and beautiful uh yeah i

45:27.840 --> 45:33.440
i think uh i mean you're gonna have to wait in line for six more gregorian hours to get your

45:33.440 --> 45:40.640
replacement beignet so i wouldn't uh recommend that i uh you could probably ask around to like

45:40.640 --> 45:43.680
if there's a lot of people eating beignets i guarantee there's a few people it's like

45:43.680 --> 45:51.600
oh yeah i what if i don't i ate one i'm good for a good long while there's probably somebody

45:51.600 --> 45:55.920
that's still drunk sleeping on a beignet pillow that you can just like gently lift up

45:55.920 --> 46:00.960
just nibble the corners out of from under their sleeping head god i don't know how you all do it

46:00.960 --> 46:06.240
they're really good they're really good you're square i did i mentioned the bag of higher

46:06.240 --> 46:12.160
sugar i did root around there like some sort of specially trained pig to find the beignets

46:12.160 --> 46:15.280
uh how about a yahoo uh yeah i love that

46:20.240 --> 46:25.920
i was gonna i was i was gonna say when you did a munch squat there's no fucking way you're not

46:25.920 --> 46:34.720
doing a haunted doll watch it's a big easy baby anything goes that nolan's magic stop it no you

46:34.720 --> 46:39.600
can't we put a moratorium on saying i'm making jokes i'm sorry i can't about about the great

46:39.600 --> 46:43.760
snl skit we saw about new orleans the day before we came here and then it was like well that's

46:43.760 --> 46:50.000
unavoidable it was just okay it was very good sorry the spirit of jade haunted porcelain doll

46:50.000 --> 46:55.360
very active let me try to break up the pacing of that in a way that makes sense there's no

46:55.360 --> 47:02.560
punctuation to help but the spirit of jade haunted porcelain doll very active i i like that you

47:02.560 --> 47:08.480
threw a question mark in there no it is the spirit of jade i am uh jade was 30 years old when she

47:08.480 --> 47:15.360
passed away she has shared with me that she actually we heard some awes 30 is way above

47:15.360 --> 47:20.400
the curve for these things that's a great full long life to it for a haunted doll jade was 30

47:20.400 --> 47:25.440
years old when she passed away she shared with me that she accidentally fell down an incredibly

47:25.440 --> 47:36.160
steep staircase she repeatedly emphasized just how steep the staircase was it was pretty much

47:36.160 --> 47:41.680
a lighthouse man it was fucked up this was like a totally normal staircase to die on you wouldn't

47:41.680 --> 47:47.520
be embarrassed to die on this you know she fell down a three-step staircase it's just embarrassed

47:47.520 --> 47:54.000
about it oh dude it was like a one inch rise and a one inch run it was ridiculous she was in such

47:54.000 --> 48:01.360
a hurry and she lost her footing she has shown me visions of this happening they are no no hold on

48:01.360 --> 48:08.000
let me show you it's crazy it's so steep if she had been like an mc escher painting if she had

48:08.000 --> 48:14.560
been wearing different shoes her death may have been avoidable am i right sliding doors jade was

48:14.560 --> 48:19.760
not used to her new stilettos jade is so i've never thought about a haunted doll being like

48:19.760 --> 48:29.040
yeah i died but listen it wasn't my fault learn from my mistakes break in your shoes jade's doll

48:29.040 --> 48:36.240
vessel is very tall to the top of her head she is 20 inches tall holy shit if you count her removable

48:36.240 --> 48:44.560
headpiece she is about 25 inches it's like a hit it's like a hat okay hey all hats are removable

48:44.560 --> 48:50.240
head pieces though a removable headpiece not for dollars is the removable headpiece haunted

48:50.240 --> 48:59.920
can i just read this please jade's body is made completely of porcelain including her stomach

48:59.920 --> 49:07.520
okay oh huh all right she jade's body is made completely of porcelain including her stomach

49:07.520 --> 49:12.160
so she does not bend at the waist she is on the heavier side as a result of this hold up hold up

49:12.160 --> 49:19.440
hold up hold up hold up hold up at what point is this a haunted statue i would argue if you're

49:19.440 --> 49:25.760
entirely if you are not if you are not able to flex in any way if you if your joints don't bend

49:25.760 --> 49:32.400
in any way you're a statue at that point yes and she is even more stunning in person jade has so

49:32.400 --> 49:37.760
many beautiful details i tried my best to get pictures showing this i'm going to have to ship

49:37.760 --> 49:42.560
her in a pretty large box and it will likely cost me much more than usual so keep that in mind when

49:42.560 --> 49:49.600
you look at the price can you imagine someone telling you this and then later they were like

49:49.600 --> 49:55.040
there's also a ghost inside of it i should have mentioned actually the ghost is i know i got to

49:55.040 --> 50:00.400
do a lot of details about that but also there's a ghost inside of it um please be prepared for

50:00.400 --> 50:06.320
paranormal activity if you decide to adopt jane she is not a shy lady she loves to make her presence

50:06.320 --> 50:11.040
known and she really revels in attention she may give you a startle at times with loud noises

50:11.040 --> 50:14.960
sometimes it's just like loud banging hitting the outside of the house and suddenly you hear it

50:14.960 --> 50:20.480
inside increasing in speed urgent this can certainly be scary but jade means you no harm

50:21.360 --> 50:25.680
okay i'm not going to know the difference between the outside banging that turns into

50:25.680 --> 50:32.400
faster and faster inside banging that does mean me harm how i don't i don't i don't want to become

50:32.400 --> 50:37.920
inoculated to outside banging that becomes louder and faster inside banging i want that to always

50:37.920 --> 50:43.600
scare the shit out of me she is we've been doing a lot of haunted well you you've done a lot of

50:43.600 --> 50:49.440
haunted doll watches on the show right uh-huh i've never heard of noises outside the house

50:49.440 --> 50:56.320
yeah at what point is the ghost not trapped in a doll yeah uh she is not a dark spirit it would

50:56.320 --> 51:02.240
never harm anyone she has shared with me that she did not okay she has shared with me that she did

51:02.240 --> 51:08.240
not even eat the flesh of animals when she was alive which is let me think the craziest way to

51:08.240 --> 51:13.840
say that possible uh possible jade possesses such a strong positive energy she has such an

51:13.840 --> 51:19.120
uplifting comforting quality she's a ghost jade certainly makes for great company and loves to

51:19.120 --> 51:22.800
stay close to your side she's a ghost again she's a ghost if you leave her in another room as you

51:22.800 --> 51:30.080
sleep you'll often find that she has moved you closer to you hard pass i see you're a non-believer

51:30.080 --> 51:34.720
so let me convince you with these very fast bullet points i'm sorry one jade communicates via

51:34.720 --> 51:39.360
ouija board pendulum evp spirit dies automatic writing and dream walking through dreams she

51:39.360 --> 51:50.480
has showed me events in my future before they happened mostly stairs related jade reveals

51:50.480 --> 51:56.160
her presence with an orb that i describe as electric purple it's neon it's not because that

51:56.160 --> 52:02.480
would not be a ghost uh i've never witnessed orbing as bright as jade's let's delete that

52:02.480 --> 52:10.240
word i've never seen these orbs like these it always she loves everyone equally but has

52:10.240 --> 52:16.480
admitted that babies are her favorite you don't have hold on no you don't that's the wildest

52:16.480 --> 52:24.080
thing in here yet uh listen i know it may seem like i really like babies i like everyone equally

52:24.080 --> 52:32.400
so calm down also no one likes everyone equally this is so wild as an avid animal lover pets are

52:32.400 --> 52:37.280
drawn to her they can sense how she feels a deep adoration for them my eldest cat always wants to

52:37.280 --> 52:45.200
rub up close to her and eventually falls asleep right at her feet hey how giant is your cat gonna

52:45.200 --> 52:53.520
be when you sold her favorite doll for 60 cool dollars hey hey excuse me vicki can we talk about

52:53.520 --> 52:59.520
this for a second that's like my favorite doll to curl up on you know that i've pissed on that doll

52:59.520 --> 53:04.560
for years i've pissed on that doll for years we noticed her facial expression changing comma her

53:04.560 --> 53:12.320
eyes shifting that's a whole bullet point she loves to make sounds as i previously mentioned

53:12.320 --> 53:16.720
she also whispers and hums she does this most when the sun is setting this is her favorite

53:16.720 --> 53:21.920
time of the day good now i know when to be out of the house if we're going to share a space

53:22.640 --> 53:27.680
um okay i just a couple more because again i don't want to spend there's pages so much holy

53:27.680 --> 53:33.680

53:33.680 --> 53:39.840

53:39.840 --> 53:46.560
sell their jeeps does this look like the jeep for you get up in this jeep this is like it gets a

53:46.560 --> 53:53.760
little all-purpose i here towards the end um i cannot stress it enough give spirits time give

53:53.760 --> 54:02.160
them space remain open-minded and you'll be amazed by the way i wrote this i noticed many other sellers

54:02.160 --> 54:07.360
on ebay literally copied and pasted this from me along with other things just letting everyone know

54:07.360 --> 54:16.640
winky face i love this territorial better pros loves ghosts and dolls that's the that's the

54:16.640 --> 54:25.520
primary uh ebay seller um who's buying this hana doll for 60 with a closed mind yeah okay i assume

54:25.520 --> 54:29.440
so it's sold i'm assuming this is sold it's gone it's already gone i'm assuming uh we're going to

54:29.440 --> 54:33.200

54:33.200 --> 54:41.520
by one oops it's sold congratulations well done that's $60 uh we have done more for the haunted

54:41.520 --> 54:47.360
doll industry yes all right so we're gonna call a few people down uh go ahead and just head to one

54:47.360 --> 54:51.040
of there's a microphone there and a microphone there whichever one's close um what's your name

54:51.040 --> 54:56.960
shrewd so my question is is recently i've been like writing an extensive story and every time

54:56.960 --> 55:02.560
i come to like a fight scene i don't know how to write it sure so i was wondering how would you

55:02.560 --> 55:10.080
write a fight scene what's your story about though pirates thank you this is this is how i would write

55:10.080 --> 55:23.520
it okay lights up all right one pirate looks at another he says go eat beans i have scurvy

55:23.520 --> 55:28.640
and he starts fighting like a scurvy okay you're describing the action just i want the words in

55:28.640 --> 55:33.520
the book oh wait are these the words in the book this is not a good book my friend wait does he is

55:33.520 --> 55:38.640
he using scurvy like a weapon i have scurvy look out i'm a cop on you i think he talks a lot about

55:38.640 --> 55:45.200
how he has scurvy and then uh about 10 or 15 pages after this middle of the fight he's like actually

55:45.200 --> 55:51.360
well it's a girl pirate okay thank you no this is good it's important because girls can't get scurvy

55:51.360 --> 56:00.000
um no she like stands up to her full height or the inverse of whatever scurvy does and it's like

56:00.000 --> 56:04.640
actually i didn't have scurvy the entire time isn't that good and then she wins the fight

56:05.360 --> 56:10.400
i think it's important when you write um not to spell everything out and to let the audience

56:10.400 --> 56:16.080
kind of fill it in like in their picture so i would just write clang clang clang clang

56:16.080 --> 56:25.040
that's good oof oof ow blood my lifeblood it's everywhere oh no i like i've never seen anyone

56:25.040 --> 56:30.480
move like that i like when authors do that by which i mean i hate it because it's like give me

56:30.480 --> 56:34.480
the words when it's like they drew their swords and then it's like a new paragraph and it's like

56:34.480 --> 56:39.840
the fight was very short new chapter fuck you what happened in the fight tell me everything

56:39.840 --> 56:44.160
make it exhaustively detailed he pulled this she pulled the sword out of the scabbard and the other

56:44.160 --> 56:50.320
one did too they took a step closer then another step then one more step they're almost in sword

56:50.320 --> 56:56.160
fighting distance now one of them stepped back uh-oh the other one took a step forward their back

56:56.160 --> 57:08.240
sort of neutral ground the swords touched a little bit and they didn't wait it's starting to sound

57:08.240 --> 57:20.000
kind of erotic can i can i can i ask is that off the table in this book i'd rather not okay all

57:20.000 --> 57:26.400

58:06.320 --> 58:13.360
is that i have recently graduated college in december thank you thank you um and and continues

58:13.360 --> 58:17.360
with some good news which is that my lovely girlfriend is also attending college still in

58:17.360 --> 58:22.240
grad school fantastic news is well done you all got it all figured out the bad news is that that

58:22.240 --> 58:26.560
has separated us and we now live in different cities so frequently most weekends i have to

58:26.560 --> 58:32.000
go back up to the city where she lives to see her okay which presents a problem and that problem is

58:32.000 --> 58:46.720
that my vape keeps setting off her smoke detector yes um just like romeo and juliet star crossed

58:46.720 --> 58:55.280
lovers of the ages tale as old as time our parents didn't care if we were together but my vape did

58:56.560 --> 59:01.520
so so what i'm wondering is how is it that i can keep spending this wonderful time with

59:01.520 --> 59:08.400
my girlfriend but also keep keep chuffing that cotton yeah crack that fucking cotton

59:09.120 --> 59:13.120
listen you've got to compete at regionals next week you can't stop ripping cotton

59:14.080 --> 59:19.680
you need to practice you'll never learn the triple volcano you don't keep cranking that cotton uh if

59:19.680 --> 59:26.480
you're a cop or an adult family member of mine who's older than me you legally have to pause

59:26.480 --> 59:31.600
the podcast or mute it for a little bit if you take a toilet paper roll or a paper towel roll and stuff

59:31.600 --> 59:37.200
it with a dryer she knows shit i was thinking the exact same thing that'll get you there you

59:37.200 --> 59:43.680
use that for other stuff too unpause cops wait no you're gonna hear it pausing works they'll

59:43.680 --> 59:51.040
never hear the rest of it we had a moving tribute to all later in the episode that they'll never hear

59:51.040 --> 59:57.520
now it was a star-studded event star-studded tribute to god and now here's john legend to talk

59:57.520 --> 01:00:09.520
about cops i guess okay uh jack your priorities kick ass bud jack jack come inside dinner's ready

01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:17.360
i can't babe i gave you the most like sort of uh you know stoner technology answer to that but

01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:28.320
there's also windows or blow it somewhere else you can't just blow it under a table or something

01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:36.400
what's that yourself a yankee cannonball they're they're fairly large and they kind of

01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:42.480
expand into the space though what are you doing dude you gotta have one jack jack do you do you

01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:46.480
have your rig with you now no we can't this is a nice theater i don't want him to crank cotton i

01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:51.760
just want to see how we're working with the problem is um i've had to replace it temporarily

01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:58.000
with a jewel because otherwise i can't go visit my girlfriend oh my god save that for how did

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:04.160
this get made the the cloud chucker just sits in my room now sad and forlorn because i can't bring

01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:08.000
it to baton rouge if you had brought it i could have fixed it for you i just would have swapped

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:18.320
out the coils for some ohms how often is this happening my man um well it would happen every

01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:23.600
time that i went up there which is why i've had to switch because i love my girlfriend and she

01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:28.640
loves me she does not love having to deal with a fire alarm going off every time i visit uh yeah

01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:33.600
okay yeah i i honestly the blank i hate to say this but the blame lies with your girlfriend you

01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:39.520
you know what no no no hear me out you should have taken the batteries out of the fire alarm

01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:44.560
long ago and or and you should have disconnected it and thrown it in the garbage because the

01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:55.120
important thing is that my god jack keeps cranking that cotton and that's the last we ever heard of

01:01:55.120 --> 01:02:02.000
them hey everybody it's just a mackerel human and non-podcaster leave those things they're

extremely important those are your helpful fire friends uh yeah i don't know what other advice we

01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:15.360
can give you jack other than turn your head in a different direction look for a i don't care how

01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:23.200

01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:28.000

outrageous and just keep just keep doing it over and over again especially when it's not

01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:11.040

01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:20.240

01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:24.960
corn vending machine what

01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:29.920
i think i speak for the room when i say we're all ears

01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:42.960
okay so i'm from south louisiana but i'm attending college in north louisiana where

01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:47.040
there's a lot of hunting okay so there's a lot of deer corn vending machines what is

01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:52.720
deer corn yeah deer corn is what you lay out to attract the deers like shoot them yeah okay

01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:57.520
like dried corn what do they do to it that makes it not griffin corn it's not on a cob

01:04:57.520 --> 01:05:01.600
it's what it's not on a cob i can enjoy corn not on the cob

01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:08.640
so the first time that i heard about it i was thinking like it's an actual corn on the cob

01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:13.360
vending machine yeah so how can we make that happen okay

01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:24.960
welcome to dragon's den yeah right you've confused our show with shark tank

01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:30.480
oh my god but if you are looking for investors you have come to the right place

01:05:31.040 --> 01:05:35.920
because i am interested and i'll give you a bajillion dollars okay all right here i go here

01:05:35.920 --> 01:05:40.880
i go here i go the part where the corn lives that you can see it through the glass does have to be

01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:47.200
refrigerated just for food safety reasons when you buy it it's going to go down a tube there's

01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:53.360
three different tubes regular tube butter tube butter and salt tube at some point that tube's

01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:59.600
got to go through a hot zone hot something you know the cup that picks up your bottle from some

01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:03.600
vending machines and takes it out that's just filled with boiling water so it picks up your

01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:11.360
raw corn boils it right there as you watch and then it shoots it out at you super fast but you

01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:16.800
gotta watch out for deer because they got wind of this they love that shit they love it they they

01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:23.440
said we're tired of you selling us dried bags of murder corn can you imagine fucking being a deer

01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:30.080
and seeing someone just eat real food corn and be like fuck soft corn no wonder we keep getting

01:06:30.080 --> 01:06:37.600
blasted i can't believe i died for hard crumbly corn this is the pits oh brian i wish i lived in

01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:45.440
your world just climb inside that brain and just live right in there that's the kind of brain brand

01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:51.760
you got the kind of brain that had not only fleetingly had the idea of corn vending machines

01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:56.480
but then another part of your brain was like hey good stuff let's hold on to that for a little bit

01:06:56.480 --> 01:07:03.120
okay let's go ahead and cling to that concept for a grip because it's going to be useful someday

01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:08.480
this is your this is your own personal slumdog millionaire it's just the moment that that idea

01:07:08.480 --> 01:07:12.640
waited for because somebody sitting in here is a vending machine magnate who was like

01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:21.360
i'll find brian after the show or i'll steal that yes that's more likely um does that does that i

01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:26.000
was gonna say does that help but i don't know that there's any way it possibly could help we

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:33.760
have to splinter our reality into another dimension um which doesn't did that not help

01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:40.800
i mean it didn't not help it did not help thank you brian take it and thank you to you new orleans
