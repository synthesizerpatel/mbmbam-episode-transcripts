00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:48.240
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother my brother mean advice show for the modern era.

00:48.800 --> 00:51.840
My name is Justin McElroy and I'm your oldest brother?

00:52.880 --> 00:57.280
My name is Miller's brother and I and I'm Travis your brother.

00:57.280 --> 01:02.640
I'm your sweet baby brother Griffin rock and roll McElroy.

01:02.640 --> 01:06.480
I have an emergency that needs to be addressed immediately.

01:06.480 --> 01:08.400
Is it Travis's microphone?

01:08.400 --> 01:12.080
Should we Travis's microphone is fine don't see you fucking draw people's attention to it now

01:12.080 --> 01:13.440
they're now they can't unsee.

01:13.440 --> 01:16.080
I think they'll figure out that he's talking to us.

01:16.080 --> 01:21.440
No you did the same thing with the person mowing the lawn and you're like they'll hear it they'll

01:21.440 --> 01:25.040
hear it and then we got a million complaints and now I'm gonna get a million tweets saying

01:25.040 --> 01:29.600
why was Travis recording on a fucking talk boy why was he recording on a goddamn yak back?

01:29.600 --> 01:32.240
Can I get to my emergency?

01:32.240 --> 01:33.280
Do your bit.

01:33.280 --> 01:41.440
We all it's not a bit it's life or death uh we are recording we have one hour to record

01:41.440 --> 01:46.720
the best show of our lives uh it's kind of like the movie Speed we're under a deadline

01:47.280 --> 01:53.200
uh and right before we like right once the call had started and we had started the recording

01:53.200 --> 02:01.040
I reached for my can of crisp refreshing pepsi max and realized that it was empty.

02:01.040 --> 02:06.880
Oh my god brothers I have no beverages can you hear it already?

02:06.880 --> 02:10.880
I can you're getting all creaky and croaky like some sort of mountain man like some sort of man

02:10.880 --> 02:12.880
made it like cleft into a mountain face.

02:12.880 --> 02:15.680
Oil can pepsi max.

02:15.680 --> 02:17.680
Yeah pepsi max me.

02:17.680 --> 02:21.680
It's not inaccurate because once while living in Chicago I had to change my license plate but the

02:21.680 --> 02:27.040
screws were rusted on and I fucking used pepsi max to dissolve the to dissolve that that rust

02:27.040 --> 02:31.520
right off there and it works that's a thing you can do but I'm like I'm you're putting that you're

02:31.520 --> 02:37.040
putting that in your shit box Justin so just for thought I'm freaking out though like I'm freaking

02:37.040 --> 02:44.240
out because I have no beverage and I must record a comedy podcast with no drink at all yeah as

02:44.240 --> 02:49.120
those of you who are at the Midwest live shows know I need a certain sort of drink for those

02:49.120 --> 02:56.080
but I'm just talking about like a general beverage yeah like a wet like a wet fluid I'm freaking out

02:56.080 --> 02:57.840
I'm already thinking about exit strategies.

02:57.840 --> 03:02.400
Hey Justin we're gonna make it through this together and I just I know that you're in a

03:02.400 --> 03:06.720
panic state but I do have to point out that the movie Speed did not involve them having to drive

03:06.720 --> 03:09.920
for an hour or else the film would have been called Duration.

03:11.760 --> 03:14.880
Well it would have been great though if it was like we have to drive for an hour because that's

03:14.880 --> 03:21.680
the closest store that has Pepsi Max. I have two other qualifying factors to this uh one I ate

03:21.680 --> 03:29.600
three spicy buffalo wheat thins before I realized the beverage situation and also I have a bowl of

03:31.280 --> 03:37.280
leftover Honey Nut Cheerios milk that is next to me and this episode for me is about not

03:37.840 --> 03:42.800
drinking it because I am I'm worried I'm gonna get desperate you know what I mean like without

03:42.800 --> 03:49.440
a beverage. So when we hear the sound the telltale sound of sloppy slopping coming from your oh

03:50.400 --> 03:54.880
and there it goes. Not yet not yet I'm not I can't do it. Jesus take the wheel

03:54.880 --> 03:59.440
as specifically from Justin's hand. And when you say leftover Cheerios it's five o'clock

03:59.440 --> 04:06.240
it's five p.m somewhere specifically sitting sitting for a while. Oh god damn it don't

04:07.280 --> 04:11.440
don't do it just do it I'm not gonna ask your question instead. This is an advice show for

04:11.440 --> 04:15.520
the modern era I should have mentioned before uh also a quick thank you to everybody who came to

04:15.520 --> 04:21.600
those shows we'll be um trickling those out uh over the next few months I'm assuming uh so if

04:21.600 --> 04:27.360
we make like recurring jokes they were recorded in three nights in succession but thank you to

04:27.360 --> 04:30.720
everybody who came out that was a lot of fun. I think the I think the only thing we'll probably

04:30.720 --> 04:35.360
end up referring back to from the trip was the time that we did a live show that two people

04:35.360 --> 04:41.680
two and a half people got engaged well sorry four and a half people five people got engaged at our

04:41.680 --> 04:46.000
live show. Also speaking of live shows I believe we'll be announcing a new batch of those at the

04:46.000 --> 04:50.400
end of this episode. Holy shit will we that is correct yeah we will yes we will serendipity

04:50.400 --> 04:54.800
wow god damn stay tuned where's it gonna be ah they're already gone they all fast forwarded

04:54.800 --> 04:58.960
you guys want to kick it for a little while yeah yeah let's just get do I so I have time to go

04:58.960 --> 05:03.600
grab a drink fuck no you don't let's get some answers dog all right let's get some answers

05:03.600 --> 05:10.560
going here we go first I want to tell you guys about I was watching Survivor last night you

05:10.560 --> 05:15.840
guys watched Survivor oh fuck yeah well we got time to chat um the it there was an amazing moment

05:15.840 --> 05:22.880
last night Survivor where Jeff was like it was the reward challenge and Jeff Probst says and once you

05:22.880 --> 05:28.960
get to the end of that zipline what's gonna be waiting for you is a picnic and these adults were

05:28.960 --> 05:38.640
like whoo and then Jeff Probst adds a pizza picnic and these 13 adults lose their minds like the idea

05:38.640 --> 05:45.520
of a pizza picnic was so thrilling to them that they that they were willing to climb or or solve

05:45.520 --> 05:50.640
or whatever Jeff has swallow whatever Jeff had in store for them they had to get to that pizza and

05:50.640 --> 05:54.560
when I get it they were trying one guy was trying to decide somebody else to take on the trip and

05:54.560 --> 06:01.520
this woman was like super fan of what pizza picnics yeah all of us are yeah all of it that

06:01.520 --> 06:08.240
describes all of us super fan of pizza picnics or do you mean Survivor as in like as if to say

06:08.240 --> 06:12.240
that somehow qualifies you more what's your favorite part of Survivor ooh definitely when

06:12.240 --> 06:18.960
they eat pizza on it I like the parts of Survivor when they visit like uh developing nations and

06:18.960 --> 06:24.480
they bring school books to the kids so enriching this cultural exchange you're welcome and then they

06:24.480 --> 06:30.320
have a secret meal they always have a secret meal before or after that they don't invite the native

06:30.320 --> 06:35.840
peoples too that's just the secret uh secret american meal anyway here's the questions I have

06:35.840 --> 06:41.440
several jobs where I lost and found bins would fill up with pretty nice clothes that stayed there

06:41.440 --> 06:49.360
for months on end my question is twofold first oh oh that cotton mouth first what is the statute

06:49.360 --> 06:54.000
of limits what if I got like really good at pronunciation my problem that's the secret your

06:54.000 --> 06:59.760
mouth has been too wet in case a moist mouth though myself what is the statute of limitations

06:59.760 --> 07:05.520
on lost and found items how long do I have to wait until I can claim one as my own second what

07:05.520 --> 07:12.800
is the statute of limitations on wearing clothes to work that I scored from lost and found at work

07:14.640 --> 07:20.320
that's for free clothes in California there's an important factor here do you think and of course

07:20.320 --> 07:24.720
they can't answer because that's not how this communication system works but do you think that

07:24.720 --> 07:31.040
this is a job in which they are pretty sure that the clothing are left by customers or left by

07:31.040 --> 07:39.600
other people that work there or it is left by the ceo or whatever boss-like figure exists

07:39.600 --> 07:46.240
in this establishment um who just stocks the lost and found with tight looking clothes

07:46.240 --> 07:52.160
to make them think that they have a certain level of clientele coming in that can just

07:52.160 --> 07:58.080
lackadaisically leave their their clothes lying around and so they think the business is doing

07:58.080 --> 08:04.320
very very well is that a mark echo hoodie nice nice summit we we're doing great we're pulling

08:04.320 --> 08:09.920
in that mark echo money apparently I know we laid off 14 people last week but I guess we're doing

08:09.920 --> 08:16.320
mark echo good are those are those Dolce and Gabbana jams who wore those into the store we

08:16.320 --> 08:23.520
we are attracting quite the clientele here maybe it's a test what what what how could this be

08:23.520 --> 08:28.640
brothers how can how are people leaving their fucking clothes behind but that's what I'm saying

08:28.640 --> 08:33.360
because if it's customers I totally get it because like that's the kind of thing where it's like did

08:33.360 --> 08:38.080
I leave it at the movies today we went out for coffee at where did I leave my hoodie you know

08:38.080 --> 08:42.800
that thing but like if you work there then you're like okay I had it when I got to work I didn't

08:42.800 --> 08:49.360
have it when I got home like where's my under where's my oxford shirt I wore it to work and

best non-beginner snake I am getting a new snake but I don't want an amateur level snake such as

10:44.080 --> 10:52.240
a ball python or corn snake update I have a budget of four hundred dollars or update please help

10:52.240 --> 11:02.240
snake attack okay slightly less on the expertise scale something between ball python and the

11:02.240 --> 11:09.280
ball python and the anaconda from anaconda maybe you go with snake pliskin he requires a lot of

11:09.280 --> 11:13.840
care and feeding and he's always trying to escape uh-huh that's a different that's a challenge his

11:13.840 --> 11:21.760
depth perception is terrible so don't try some sort of solid snake yeah just one long solid snake

11:21.760 --> 11:27.200
yeah don't try and get any liquid snakes I always wondered about that that's not a good code name

11:27.200 --> 11:34.160
for like a super super duper spy because I'm out of rats Timmy hasn't come back to feed me yeah

11:34.160 --> 11:38.160
do you think that was a subtle reference to like solid thing was like a boner

11:41.280 --> 11:44.880
like I saw Debbie last night she was looking real good I got a real solid snake I'm not

11:44.880 --> 11:48.640
gonna fucking yes and this shit if you want to see it through to its natural conclusion that's

11:48.640 --> 11:52.960
on you no I'll help you out I'll do a whole self-dialogue about it you're saying Hideo

11:52.960 --> 11:59.520
Kojima was like what can we do what can we name this person that will be the most dude studliest

11:59.520 --> 12:05.040
name imaginable and it's like how about Guy Hardcock and no can we get something with a

12:05.040 --> 12:10.880
little bit more illusion than that something a little bit more a little bit more prairie home

12:10.880 --> 12:16.560
companion a little bit less jerky boys I really like the idea of somebody like looking at somebody

12:16.560 --> 12:22.480
else with a ball python and being like uh can I can I ask an important question though how do you

12:22.480 --> 12:28.880
measure snake expertise how do you how do you here's here's my snake expertise you want to know

12:28.880 --> 12:33.600
what it is I've never been bitten by a snake so I think I'm pretty fucking good at it right I think

12:33.600 --> 12:37.440
I'm pretty good at snakes I live in Texas it's not out of the the realm of possibilities I've seen a

12:37.440 --> 12:42.160
snake when you uh when you buy a snake they actually give you a little counter that you hang

12:42.160 --> 12:46.800
on the wall and says like day since swallowed right and if he and it ticks up every day and

12:46.800 --> 12:51.200
if you get to like a hundred that seems like a pretty good streak you're ready for the next level

12:51.200 --> 12:57.600
you get to cash that card in and they're like oh in 100 days okay here's a king cobra but you well

12:58.400 --> 13:03.840
well king cobras can be sweethearts actually if you milk them properly I think the the hardest

13:03.840 --> 13:09.280
thing about owning a snake would be learning to overcome the urge like when you see the snake

13:09.280 --> 13:14.560
when you walk into your room like give me an axe yeah it's a snake I gotta kill it well I bought

13:14.560 --> 13:21.920
you do you guys want to hear a fun a fun true snake anecdote is it even remotely funny yeah

13:23.600 --> 13:30.400
Bob and Bradbury and Teresa and I we went to the Cincinnati zoo okay and we were walking around we

13:30.400 --> 13:37.040
were drinking some beers we were getting a mild zoo drunk they have that yeah and we walked into

13:37.040 --> 13:43.360
the reptile house and as we walked in I passed this tiny bearded gentleman who who was wearing

13:43.360 --> 13:49.920
a zoo staff shirt panicking at a door and he just turned to me with no preface and said hold this

13:49.920 --> 13:55.760
and dumped a giant snake in my arms that's and turned back to the door and his key had gotten

13:55.760 --> 14:02.400
stuck in the door and he was panicking which did not put me at ease but then you left me standing

14:02.400 --> 14:08.720
there with no explanation there is no way this happened this did not happen at a professional

14:08.720 --> 14:15.680
proof of it was it was it a zoo or was it like a dream zoo in your mind that you dreamed no this

14:15.680 --> 14:23.840
was real and I it was fucking terrifying what kind of snake was it it was a yellow one oh maybe a uh

14:24.640 --> 14:30.800
San Francisco garter snake maybe it's a corn snake no it was bigger than that he seemed he had a mean

14:30.800 --> 14:36.080
look in his eye how um what do you do with your old snake when you because you obviously can't

14:36.080 --> 14:42.000
keep these snakes together snakes hate each other so much you know why snakes are so fast is they

14:42.000 --> 14:46.320
have to be fast as soon as they're born their mom turns around like a swallow gulp they are the

14:46.320 --> 14:52.880
gulpinest animals around and for that reason I I have a sinister love for them um but what do you

14:52.880 --> 15:00.720
do when you get a new harder snake you have to pass your snake to a novice I guess that's true

15:00.720 --> 15:07.360
yeah there's probably a craigslist like chapter a chapter of craigslist just full of old snakes

15:07.360 --> 15:13.360
just old basic snakes you got a real basic snake there do you get snake trade-in credit

15:13.360 --> 15:19.360
if you trade in here at snake stop do you get snake trading credit for your all-use snakes

15:19.360 --> 15:23.680
hey I guess you'll never believe it we got a western hog nose dropping next month that's

15:23.680 --> 15:27.840

pepperoni and cheese on it hey hey you're a pizza Travis has sent us an image Travis wants to send

17:30.640 --> 17:34.320
us an image file gonna look at this and Travis has just sent us a picture of him with a snake

17:34.320 --> 17:38.160
sorry Travis didn't mean to doubt you that wasn't a lie but this fucking workout pizza

17:38.160 --> 17:45.040
definitely still is uh I don't understand wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute

17:45.040 --> 17:52.320
what if this isn't like a planet fitness promotion because that again is fucking patently insane

17:53.040 --> 18:00.240
maybe one person who works at planet fitness uh buys a pizza for themselves every week to enjoy

18:00.960 --> 18:04.080
and then leaves the room and comes back is like again

18:04.080 --> 18:10.560
man yogi I'm gonna get you pizza thief somebody keeps like teenager ninja turtles in me

18:11.520 --> 18:18.080
they scarf my za I have a more sinister theory and that is that there's a sort of

18:18.960 --> 18:26.800
panopticon that exists in the planet fitness um universe where it's probably the most personal

18:26.800 --> 18:35.760
panopticon a personal panopticon a network of surveillance for mr fitness himself the owner

18:35.760 --> 18:43.920
of the whole franchise uh once a month can just watch people just slam down on some pizza in his

18:43.920 --> 18:50.800
place of business and like the denial of pizza from himself gives gives him like the raging

18:50.800 --> 18:55.520
a solid snake like you could ever imagine a human being and it's like fucking it's just

18:55.520 --> 19:00.160
super fit and muscular boner um and it's like the best one that you could that anyone can

19:00.160 --> 19:04.960
possibly get and the only way he can get it is through his big brother style pizza surveillance

19:04.960 --> 19:09.840
system is it possible that this is a honeypot that they're trying to keep you needing the planet

19:09.840 --> 19:17.040
fitness services for longer how's his progress going jeremy it's going pretty good fill fitness

19:17.040 --> 19:24.000
i think he's just about really fit well unleash the za and then you order he orders pizza from

19:24.000 --> 19:30.160
a store right that's by unleashing it he gets another place to make it don't tip very well

19:30.160 --> 19:38.000
planet fitness isn't doing super great i'm not made of money jeremy is it possible single topping

19:38.000 --> 19:45.680
jeremy is this a uh is this like a muscle confusion like a tummy confusion type of thing

19:45.680 --> 19:50.080
whereas your tummy's like oh fuck yeah thanks griffin we're taking it to pizza town why are you

19:50.080 --> 19:56.960
running why are you running i want to watch all the episodes of parks and recreation and just

19:56.960 --> 20:04.080
chill for once i thought we were gonna play persona on the couch and now you're running

20:04.080 --> 20:11.040
you confused me oh man i just lost 30 pounds thanks griffin i i i think that the the problem

20:11.040 --> 20:15.200
with that is that your tummy upon sensing the workout this is the way the body works

20:15.200 --> 20:21.520
your tummy upon sensing the workouts like oh no the pizza i gotta hold on to it stay with me

20:21.520 --> 20:26.560
pizza don't run away so your tummy's gonna hold all that pizza it's not gonna digest it

20:26.560 --> 20:30.720
because it's so worried about losing those precious pizza calories exactly that's exactly

20:30.720 --> 20:34.400
right justin because when you're like running on a treadmill you know what's happening that pizza's

20:34.400 --> 20:38.720
just fallen out of you just falling out of your tummy and so your tummy's gotta hold on tight

20:38.720 --> 20:47.520
oh good stay in me stay in me i love you pizza you guys i think you've picked a bad place to

20:47.520 --> 20:52.720
get fit i think you should change this question should end with should i change gyms because this

20:52.720 --> 20:58.560
is a bad one apparently where they serve pizza i think it sounds like the best possible gym uh

20:58.560 --> 21:04.000
i can't believe that wasn't a yahoo yeah that's a really weird situation to find yourself in that

21:04.000 --> 21:11.040
was a human being question wait wait we didn't actually answer it oh uh fucking absolutely not

21:11.040 --> 21:15.840
it's like you can't go to church on doughnut sunday and slam those doughnuts and then say

21:15.840 --> 21:20.640
i don't need to hear the lord's word this week later i got my doughnuts and like through them

21:20.640 --> 21:27.600
i channeled the lord's good blessing this yahoo was sent in by recognize the game of rachel

21:27.600 --> 21:39.040
sperling thank you rachel it's by yahoo answers user sdx zxz didn't even try who asks ladies

21:39.040 --> 21:46.320
i bring my guitar almost everywhere to impress women does this work for example if i go to a

21:46.320 --> 21:52.800
party or a store i'll usually bring my case with me and if i see a woman i like i will get it out

21:52.800 --> 21:58.240
and play it hoping she hears what i don't understand is why it doesn't seem to work

21:58.240 --> 22:02.960
the other day i was at target the most attractive woman i've seen in years was shopping

22:02.960 --> 22:09.120
and got my guitar out and played wonder wall but she didn't come over i went and asked her out and

22:09.120 --> 22:16.880
she said no frigid jerk don't women love guitar players confused right now it's work a few times

22:16.880 --> 22:24.640
but not as often as i thought my co-workers like it at least i think my co-workers at the weed store

22:24.640 --> 22:30.960
love it i think the problem is song choice you have to pick the right song that's going to lure

22:30.960 --> 22:36.960
them in i uh personally have always found that bob dylan's i know how to use this thing between

22:36.960 --> 22:43.200
my legs real good would you like to try it out sometime uh off of bob dylan unplugged and

22:43.200 --> 22:50.560
unrecorded give me a good it's just a person that album is just a person telling you about

22:50.560 --> 22:55.840
how great that album was yeah can you give me a few bars of i know how to use this thing between

22:55.840 --> 23:01.360
my legs between my legs and you're gonna see the thing that i'm talking about it's so this

23:01.360 --> 23:05.920
is an early one i'm guessing this is before he goes electric but right around when he went

23:05.920 --> 23:12.800
eclectic uh he did a lot of novelty hits i know how to use this thing between my legs

23:12.800 --> 23:19.680
and then do you want to see how i use it on you it's good this is a song about vaginas too

23:20.320 --> 23:25.760
all right it's all inclusive no matter what you want to use i know how to use it on you

23:26.480 --> 23:33.520
so bob don't hang all up in blue oh see okay what happened there later that song no that

23:33.520 --> 23:38.960
actually that was a mishap with a blue cable his penis got tangled up into it

23:38.960 --> 23:44.640
it could be removed surgically his penis and his vagina he gives me a great idea

23:44.640 --> 23:52.240
yeah your your dylan sounds a little urkely just a little bit you sound like billy bob from the

23:52.240 --> 24:09.440
rocket fire explosion can i get some cheese please did i do that did i do that tangled up in carl

24:09.440 --> 24:24.080
you're gonna make me stephan when you go

24:24.080 --> 24:30.000
i'm trying to i'm trying to uh uh i'm trying to figure out if i uh don't know more dylan

24:30.000 --> 24:35.280
songs or don't know more urkel references really it's hard to make the two apparently i know

24:35.280 --> 24:43.680
exactly the same that means you just store them in the same filing cabinet in your brain right

24:44.240 --> 24:51.120
oh this over here uh let's see what's stored in here oh looks like uh this is dylan references

24:51.120 --> 24:58.080
and urkel quotes i don't know why these got filed together i'm so thirsty should we go to

24:58.080 --> 25:14.560

and they actually pull moisture away from your skin it could be cool and dry can you prove they're

25:42.720 --> 25:47.360
not magical is there is there is there substantial proof that they're not magical because i'm i'm

hi i'm julie sabatier host of rendered it's a show about making meaning and breaking rules

32:28.560 --> 32:33.360
we're answering important questions like can you build a space suit in your living room

32:33.360 --> 32:37.520
i went to my brother's place in beaverton and he has a swimming pool and i pressurized the suit

32:37.520 --> 32:41.360
and sat down there underwater for about 10 minutes the thing that i built was supporting my life

32:41.360 --> 32:47.040
that felt really good what does it sound like when you play a polka record through a styrofoam cup

32:51.840 --> 32:58.080
and what happens when an airport carpet gains a cult following oh my goodness the carpet

32:58.080 --> 33:02.960
the carpet has an instagram check out rendered now at maximum fun.org

33:02.960 --> 33:08.960
or wherever you like to listen to podcasts i've been doing comedy for about a year now and i find

33:08.960 --> 33:12.960
that more and more i'm being introduced to people as a comedian how do i deal with the dreaded oh

33:12.960 --> 33:19.280
you're a comedian tell me a joke let me try again oh you're a comedian tell me a joke and that's

33:19.280 --> 33:25.040
from that's from mrs big head from rocco's modern life obviously i don't feel the need to prove my

33:25.040 --> 33:30.960
merits to the boorish people who ask this you sound funny but uh what i like to hear you three

33:30.960 --> 33:36.400
do in this situation you must get this crap once in a while uh what am i a joke jukebox is the name

33:36.400 --> 33:42.080
of that question asker you actually don't get a lot when you say like i'm a podcaster right oh

33:42.080 --> 33:48.720
then podcast for me i i have literally in my life never described myself as a comedian in my fucking

33:48.720 --> 33:54.560
life i would never do that no not a crazy thing to say like no one's like oh i'm a baker and like

33:54.560 --> 33:59.520
no one's like oh you're a baker bake something for me right now i need some fucking banana bread

33:59.520 --> 34:07.440
now let's see what you got motherfucker here's some yeast oh you're a butcher kill this dog kill

34:07.440 --> 34:15.840
this dog in front of me you can't just say shit butcher wait you're a sociopath here prove it on

34:15.840 --> 34:25.760
this bird sicko uh i mean i never would say like i don't let anybody know that i'm supposed to do

34:25.760 --> 34:30.560
jokes on the internet like i just never tell anybody that's my workaround i tell people i uh

34:30.560 --> 34:35.200
people ask what i do i say i write about video games and then i just watch as the interest drains

34:35.200 --> 34:42.560
from their face you can it's like sand from an hourglass yeah the conversation just fizzles out

34:42.560 --> 34:47.360
like i can't fire someone just dump gatorade on sometimes i'll just start explaining the rules

34:47.360 --> 34:53.520
to magic the gathering until they walk away in excruciating detail great question great

34:53.520 --> 35:00.240
here's how resources work you're gonna want to tamp the tap your mana and then um oh man i feel

35:00.240 --> 35:03.680
like the appropriate response to this is if someone's like oh you're a comedian tell me a

35:03.680 --> 35:10.880
joke you just go like no and then you like say anything else that seems good trev well i mean

35:10.880 --> 35:15.120
like what are they gonna say if they're like no i said tell me a joke this has been classic

35:15.120 --> 35:20.800
conversation enders which i was mcroy who who is this person who who is this person that is

35:20.800 --> 35:24.560
this is not a joke by the way it'd be great if you busted out like some seinfeld shit

35:24.560 --> 35:30.640
like i'm about to but um who is who is this person that hears your comedian and then responds with

35:31.600 --> 35:39.120
tell me a joke what what person exists that does that no i i can't it's beyond the fucking pale

35:39.120 --> 35:45.520
that anybody would ever do this to you enough to to give you this psychosis that you've obviously

35:45.520 --> 35:51.280
developed i i imagine not being a comedian myself that it's the kind of job title that when you say

35:51.280 --> 35:57.280
it people are immediately incredulous because it's not like you could say like i'm a teacher

35:57.280 --> 36:01.520
and people are just like okay why would you lie about that but imagine if you say like oh i'm

36:01.520 --> 36:06.960
i'm like a comedian professionally i think as people have a hard time believing that they might

36:06.960 --> 36:12.000
actually meet somebody who is funny professionally you know what i mean so they feel the need to like

36:12.000 --> 36:18.720
oh really prove it which is like the worst i had an experience along these lines yesterday i called

36:18.720 --> 36:23.680
the uh uh sort of like a customer service place about something that's too boring to recount

36:23.680 --> 36:29.200
and uh a guy asked you know how how i was doing and i said well i'm a little tired just got back

36:29.200 --> 36:35.120
from uh i was doing a uh i was in these cities you know in the midwest he said what are you doing

36:35.120 --> 36:39.680
he said what are you doing it and it was like a little tour my brothers and i do a comedy show

36:39.680 --> 36:43.840
because he said he was in minneapolis right so that's what prompted it now i remember

36:43.840 --> 36:49.120
and uh he said well um i wish i'd heard about that i would have tried to make it out

36:52.800 --> 36:57.760
really really i think that would have been a weird show for you to come out to but like i

36:57.760 --> 37:02.240
appreciate it and then he adds yeah i mean everybody needs to laugh and i was like yeah

37:02.240 --> 37:09.120
yeah it's especially you it sounds like i guess yeah like how how bad do you need to laugh where

37:09.120 --> 37:12.640
you hear about a comedy show from three chuckleheads you've never heard of and thought

37:12.640 --> 37:16.080
man i wish i could have made it out damn that sounds fucking good wish i could have gone to

37:16.080 --> 37:22.080
that thing with no context whatsoever i know it was just a pleasantry but man i it was a bridge

37:22.080 --> 37:26.320
too far you should have held them to it i'm like can i get your contact info yeah we might be

37:26.320 --> 37:32.640
coming out again i'll put you on the vip list is that what it's called yeah the vipple yeah i get

37:32.640 --> 37:37.520
that a lot for my job as game journalist i tell people i'm a game journalist and they say well

37:37.520 --> 37:41.760
you think the new battlefield and i say i don't play that fucking garbage and then i cash a 15

37:41.760 --> 37:47.200
thousand dollar check from activision and they see me they see me do all of that and they say

37:47.200 --> 37:54.000
okay well done now i get i buy it it seems like a good field how much 15 15 000 okay it sounds

37:54.000 --> 37:59.520
about right how about yahoo yeah i was about to ask by the way everybody at some point during

37:59.520 --> 38:06.480
this program i covertly have obtained a pepsi max you'll never know how uh uh wow it's people

38:06.480 --> 38:12.240
are gonna be ferreting that one out for years this yahoo is sent in by zoe kinski uh she's

38:12.240 --> 38:15.440
been sending out a lot of good stuff she's moving up the leaderboards thank you zoe it's

38:15.440 --> 38:20.400
about i need a bit for her soon yeah i know it's breaking my back it's the new it's the new jingles

38:20.400 --> 38:28.320
it's by yahoo answers user josh who asks what would you do if an arby's manager punched you in

38:28.320 --> 38:37.360
the face all right ironically if you're about to eat arby's it's not the worst thing to have

38:37.360 --> 38:44.800
happened to you in that moment uh so uh buckle in it's a little bit long okay so my friend and i

38:44.800 --> 38:49.520
go into an arby's to get some food last night not gonna lie kind of short on cash so we don't order

38:49.520 --> 38:54.160
any drinks instead ask for a water cup when our food is ready you know the manager tells us in a

38:54.160 --> 38:59.200
real douchebag way that the water isn't working and no we can't have a water cup it was like we

38:59.200 --> 39:06.720
were asking him anything outrages just a cup i ask for something else and he just continues to be

39:06.720 --> 39:11.440
way too concerned about his job i'm a server i work in a restaurant so i think this guy's crazy

39:11.440 --> 39:16.240
one for being so rude too he has to be able to supply us with something to drink we finish our

39:16.240 --> 39:20.720
meal and i decide it would be funny if i knock a rather large stack of cubs that are sitting on the

39:20.720 --> 39:30.400
counter oops jesus now this real chuckle fest now this is where it gets interesting my friend and i

39:30.400 --> 39:35.200
proceed to the exit there's a guy at the door he's using the usual fuck you blah blah blah verbal

39:35.200 --> 39:40.240
fighting stuff we kind of laugh and continue walking towards the car halfway to the car i get

39:40.240 --> 39:46.480
clocked in the face from behind you someone punched you through the back of your skull and punched

39:46.480 --> 39:52.080
you the front of your face bones off my manager ran out of the store with two other employees

39:52.080 --> 39:55.520
punched me in the face and the other employee shoved my friend to the ground

39:58.240 --> 40:02.720
i got hit pretty good this guy had a running start and i was completely blindsided

40:04.320 --> 40:08.480
i was what you didn't see is if you looked to your left you would have seen tyler durden like

40:08.480 --> 40:14.800
yeah that's right how do you feel like a man uh feel like a strong man i was knocked over your

40:14.800 --> 40:20.720
cups my friend jumped right up from being shoved he saw me get whacked so naturally he's defending

40:20.720 --> 40:26.080
me i didn't really see that part but i know he got him a few good times the guy ended up running

40:26.080 --> 40:29.360
in with blood all over his lip and shirt the other two guys are just talking shit to me surrounding

40:29.360 --> 40:33.520
me trying to scare me a man pulls up and breaks up the fight we go straight home i have a huge fat

40:33.520 --> 40:38.160
lip my jaw won't even close right my teeth hurt really bad friend's shirt is ripped up blood all

40:38.160 --> 40:44.160
over it we talked about it for a while figure we should call the cops so we do arby's had called

40:44.160 --> 40:49.760
the cops too exaggerated the story told them we threw stuff and fought them first whatever you

40:49.760 --> 40:56.400
know we called we told the cops our story but what do we do now what would you do if an arby's

40:56.400 --> 41:03.920
manager punched you in the fucking grill don't you guys feel like listening to this story that

41:03.920 --> 41:11.840
that this person telling the story like is about to say oh i guess i should also mention we were

41:11.840 --> 41:18.240
really belligerently drunk but i don't think that has any impact on the story whatsoever

41:19.760 --> 41:26.480
i should mention we were very high on um uh hallucinogenic mushrooms and we may have been

41:26.480 --> 41:31.120
at our home the entire time this may be a fiction like the time we might have been fighting each

41:31.120 --> 41:35.440
other this might have been like the time the world's worst zoo employee handed travis a snake

41:35.440 --> 41:41.760
in his mind yeah he hastily photoshopped a picture of it and then i called the police and the police

41:41.760 --> 41:47.040
said travis you've been home all day because you've called us 20 times also the snake called

41:47.040 --> 41:53.040
us beforehand and told us inside of this said i'm worried about travis he's been locked in his house

41:53.040 --> 42:00.160
all day also you're still high and you'll never not be high travis whoa um what do you i'm not

42:00.160 --> 42:04.880
interested in talking about the fight if fucking happened it's wrong violence is not the answer

42:04.880 --> 42:10.880
it's not funny we shouldn't laugh at the violence what is hilarious gut buster is how you seek

42:10.880 --> 42:17.280
justice for this act call the cops the cops said they called us first and told us their side story

42:17.280 --> 42:23.040
we have no proof it's an arby's the fucking beef oils all over the place just completely get rid

42:23.040 --> 42:27.920
of any fingerprints we could have used to figure out this crime uh it's gonna be hard to csi this

42:27.920 --> 42:33.040
one so it's your word against theirs and they work at arby's so you lose just sort of de facto

42:33.040 --> 42:39.840
right do you do you know how decrepit you have to be for the cops to say well i hear what you're

42:39.840 --> 42:43.840
saying but this arby's manager is giving us a different story and we're gonna have to go with

42:43.840 --> 42:50.720
him because he it's an institution yeah why do we always have to be so hard on arby's i like arby's

42:50.720 --> 42:55.200
they serve fine food everyone i've ever interacted with there has always been pleasant yeah i'm sure

42:55.200 --> 42:59.360
we have people listen they're working on arby's so they so they fucking cold clock every 10th

42:59.360 --> 43:05.120
person that comes so you punch the occasional dildo who cares they shouldn't have been in the

43:05.120 --> 43:09.840
store knocking over your cups and throwing things and fighting with people and starting fights

43:09.840 --> 43:16.640
that's right i i bought the arby's story too i don't buy this email you're an arbypologist

43:16.640 --> 43:21.120
this sounds like you're trying you're angling for a class action lawsuit get everybody together

43:21.120 --> 43:24.800
who's ever been punched by an arby's manager and you guys are gonna try to bring down big beef

43:24.800 --> 43:28.800
and i'm not having it but the sheer number of people who've been punched in the fucking grill

43:28.800 --> 43:33.680
by an arby's manager is so enormous at this point that you'd end up getting like a buck 16

43:33.680 --> 43:38.560
maybe you have to you would ironically have just enough to buy some jalapeno hush puppies and

43:38.560 --> 43:44.720
arby's and you promised yourself never again never again because you bought some and you got fucking

43:44.720 --> 43:50.240
cold clocked and then you ate one of them and oh the capucin what if your what if your settlement

43:50.240 --> 43:54.560
came in the form of an arby's gift certificate and it just had like a picture that manager like

43:54.560 --> 43:59.840
here we go let's do this again okay are you gonna come to tango with me name the place and time

43:59.840 --> 44:05.120
motherfucker name the place and time except this offer is not good on friday up on me and punch me

44:05.120 --> 44:12.640
in the face again try i've been ready for you oh you and your two friends buford and big buford

44:12.640 --> 44:19.280
i was taking you down i just was there a small buford sandwich by the way talking about rallies

44:19.280 --> 44:24.080
they hate each other they're different oh you gotta go to rallies and claim sanctuary

44:24.080 --> 44:31.440
oh gang war that's what i'm saying you go to rallies and you say i'm willing i'm willing to

44:31.440 --> 44:36.720
commit to you it's okay man what'd they do to you over there now listen we can figure out a way to

44:36.720 --> 44:42.720
get back at them but i need to know are you willing to die for this are you willing to beef in

44:42.720 --> 44:51.440
beef out motherfucker beef beef or die motherfucker get out there here's a chain here's a box of tots

44:51.440 --> 44:59.360
you're gonna need both on that hard battlefield yeah you're gonna find keep your strength up

44:59.360 --> 45:03.520
yes don't confuse them you make sure if you get hit with i don't know a knife

45:03.520 --> 45:07.840
if so they hit you with an arby's knife you eat those tots and your hit points are gonna come

45:07.840 --> 45:17.280
right back take this it's dangerous to go alone take this it's a curly fry it's arby's city rampage

45:17.280 --> 45:21.440
the problem with the curly fries at arby's is it's very hard to judge how many fries you've eaten

45:21.440 --> 45:26.960
no because i like to eat about 20 fries a day and if with the arby's uh fries they're very

45:26.960 --> 45:32.800
curly and long sometimes they're like four or five fries in there just like a fry you know come on

45:32.800 --> 45:38.720
obama yeah come on obama it could be it could be more accurately described as a bouquet yeah as a

45:38.720 --> 45:44.320
fry arrangement that's where you have to judge it by weight or tummy feel are we done with the

45:44.320 --> 45:50.800
podcast yeah that was the end of it it felt like the end of it to me oh exciting news yeah let's

can we get john roderick to play for us the intro at the seattle show now that he is running for

49:52.880 --> 49:58.720
seattle city council uh i you know what the only way i'd agree to that and by the way if you want

49:58.720 --> 50:03.280
to read more about his platforms you can go to vote roderick dot com uh and i don't understand

50:03.280 --> 50:06.560
any of it because it's all government i thought it was a goof at first it's a very serious no

50:06.560 --> 50:11.280
it's a yeah yeah no it's a it's it's real yeah we don't usually like to get political here but

50:11.280 --> 50:18.160
yeah i'm like i like the cut of his jib he's got some fucking good ideas and um his albums uh

50:18.160 --> 50:23.200
inspired me more in college than any other musician on earth so let's hear what he has

50:23.200 --> 50:29.840
to say about sewer maintenance yeah uh john roderick uh i will i would love to have him play

50:29.840 --> 50:34.640
the intro to our show in seattle but what i want is for him to play the intro and then once it's

50:34.640 --> 50:39.600
done stand on stage and stare at us with his fucking fingers on the fretboard just waiting

50:39.600 --> 50:44.720
for the outro that's what i mean i need him to be like and the money and the money is this now is

50:44.720 --> 50:50.800
this it now here comes uh that would let him decide when the show ends yeah yeah if he starts

50:50.800 --> 50:54.560
playing the outro that's it that's all the jokes can we also time it so that during the show he

50:54.560 --> 51:00.240
wins his city council election that would be so fucking enormous i want it to be a very important

51:00.240 --> 51:05.040
