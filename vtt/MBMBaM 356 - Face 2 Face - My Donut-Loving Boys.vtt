00:55.040 --> 01:03.200
you why are you missing Twin Peaks why are you here why are you here we have

01:03.200 --> 01:07.040
none of you had shown up we could we could be watching Twin Peaks yeah I

01:07.040 --> 01:10.480
would have been it would have been weird as we were watching the tickets sell for

01:10.480 --> 01:14.480
this if it was just like still zero tickets sold well Twin Peaks is on that

01:14.480 --> 01:18.200
night yeah we got that going for us I wanted them to buy the tickets but then

01:18.200 --> 01:29.240
does not come I wanted their money when it rained really hard I was like so

01:29.240 --> 01:35.240
we've been watching of course so we have some updates and plot points to just

01:35.240 --> 01:42.560
fill you in on first first shot of course is Deputy Andy and he steps on

01:42.560 --> 01:49.880
his own wiener and falls in a big garbage can I as as he does shot shot

01:49.880 --> 01:54.860
number two and we will go shopper shot shot number two Kyle McLaughlin as

01:54.860 --> 01:59.780
agent delcuber slow burns you say Doug Cooper Doug Cooper well it's his twin

01:59.780 --> 02:07.880
brother oh sorry he just does a slow burn to the camera and just says fuck

02:07.880 --> 02:12.920
and it's real real slow though and I know you're wondering like right after

02:12.920 --> 02:16.360
the scene where Andy steps on his wiener and falls in a big garbage that's David

02:16.360 --> 02:22.400
Lynch y'all that's how he did that's how he do shot three this time it's log man

02:22.400 --> 02:28.160
hmm different now there's a man with the log I don't know it's just a big man

02:28.160 --> 02:34.800
made of logs it's and he's got a psychic log girl and it's very different it's a

02:34.800 --> 02:39.040
superhero thing David Lynch he's the master you gotta give him that shot for

02:39.040 --> 02:45.160
Laura Palmer's back what and she's fine

02:45.480 --> 02:49.920
I never explained I said to silence my phone and while I was doing that I got a

02:49.920 --> 02:52.560
notification from my calorie counting app that was like hey you haven't logged

02:52.560 --> 02:57.080
your dinner today and it made me realize that we had Lucy's fried chicken for

02:57.080 --> 03:05.240
brunch and then we had fly right fried chicken for dinner we're gonna die yeah

03:05.240 --> 03:08.440
so when I put that into the calorie app I'm gonna get like a notification that's

03:08.440 --> 03:17.880
just like man you're not gonna try why do I have to be here so this is a this

03:17.880 --> 03:23.120
is a weird question does anybody not listen to our show before okay cool and

03:23.120 --> 03:31.320
you're weirdly excited so what we do on the shows we take questions from real

03:31.320 --> 03:35.880
people just like yourselves and we turn them alchemy like into wisdom and we're

03:35.880 --> 03:41.640
gonna start doing that well in a second after Travis interrupts apparently the

03:41.640 --> 03:44.760
last third of the show we will also take questions from the audience yes but

03:44.760 --> 03:52.280
there is one rule and that one rule is no bum sorry to the six of you who said

03:52.280 --> 03:55.600
you hadn't heard the show earlier that must have been really scary for you yeah

03:55.600 --> 04:01.480
the audience is gonna be less scary they promise so here's the first question

04:01.480 --> 04:07.600
when my girlfriend wears a backpack she leaves it completely unzipped we live in

04:07.600 --> 04:10.520
a city and I think someone will eventually just reach in and take

04:10.520 --> 04:14.360
whatever is in there when I've addressed this with her she's responded with it's

04:14.360 --> 04:19.440
easier to get things out when it's unzipped or don't tell me how to live

04:19.440 --> 04:26.880
my best life how can I convince her to zip up her backpack or am I in the wrong

04:26.880 --> 04:37.640
that's from debated in DC I've never are you here hey is she here and did she

04:37.640 --> 04:44.560
bring a backpack all right all right she is here no backpack I've never

04:44.560 --> 04:50.120
everybody I think who's listening to the show knows sort of my stance on taking

04:50.120 --> 04:58.360
things but that said I was in a production of Oliver and you played I

04:58.360 --> 05:05.800
played Oliver and I did he was I did I did pick a pocket or two it's a song I

05:05.800 --> 05:09.800
remember that but I don't do that you give me a little bit of where is love

05:09.800 --> 05:20.200
do you think is flawless cockney still it's really good that's really nice

05:20.200 --> 05:25.480
Griffin but I don't do that shit in real life I just do it at babies are us and

05:25.480 --> 05:32.640
stuff anyway but if I saw a backpack unzipped I couldn't help it just like I'd

05:32.640 --> 05:37.560
assume it was one of those like bait cam things yeah but then an army vet saw

05:37.560 --> 05:40.680
that her backpack was in there and you'll never believe oh shit John

05:40.680 --> 05:47.840
Quinone steps out of the backpack like no tip to be fair to your girlfriend in

05:47.840 --> 05:51.960
regards to the it's easier to get thing out of it that is true it's true

05:51.960 --> 05:58.080
everyone yeah oh thank you oh it's like when you see those books outside of a

05:58.080 --> 06:01.160
bookstore that are like for sale for like a dollar and it's like oh they want

06:01.160 --> 06:06.040
you to take these yeah these are to be stolen there's no one standing outside

06:06.040 --> 06:10.480
with those books those books are free if you bring them inside to pay for them

06:10.480 --> 06:18.600
their reaction is all right maybe this is sort of a self-fulfilling prophecy

06:18.600 --> 06:23.880
where if something is in there and she's willing to let it just sort of fall out

06:23.880 --> 06:28.120
yeah I just sort of flop out of there because it's open she doesn't care if it

06:28.120 --> 06:33.800
gets so yeah I had said life-changing tidying up

06:33.800 --> 06:38.520
is it smart joy no put it in my back back then yeah okay I don't really play

06:38.520 --> 06:45.240
Yu-Gi-Oh anymore I'll just put these cards in my backpack my dump bag oh how

06:45.240 --> 06:50.160
is your girlfriend or person that is here I guess I could just address your

06:50.160 --> 06:55.400
so much more I'm looking into darkness how are you wearing a backpack that

06:55.400 --> 07:00.160
having it unzipped makes it easier for you to get in it oh yeah notice kangaroo

07:00.160 --> 07:07.640
style or regular it's one strap okay so it's a it's like a cool message like

07:07.640 --> 07:13.360
spin it around like a bass guitar yeah it's like a Yu-Gi-Oh holster at that

07:13.360 --> 07:19.200
point you just have a bandolier of shit you don't care about what if this guy

07:19.200 --> 07:22.960
who vetted zippers came back to life and you were the first person he saw

07:22.960 --> 07:29.320
think about that think about my children really you didn't well I but you know

07:29.320 --> 07:35.960
how the teeth kind of go wait has everybody forgotten does no one

07:35.960 --> 07:41.640

07:58.200 --> 08:08.400
true thing it's asked by Yahoo answers user anonymous we'll call them sea lion

08:08.400 --> 08:12.320

08:12.320 --> 08:20.280
Yahoo thing the child's okay the joke plays this sea lion who got a hold of a

08:20.280 --> 08:26.760
computer and I want to hear that fucking story asks how do you stop obsessing and

08:26.760 --> 08:35.880
overcome wanting a pie smashed in your face I get it been there I I fucking get

08:35.880 --> 08:40.160
it yeah sure sometimes you're up late and you're

08:40.160 --> 08:45.960
watching your Turner classic movies like you do and you see like a Stooges or

08:45.960 --> 09:00.240
like a Marxist movie it's dumb and you see like a pie they were also that what

09:00.240 --> 09:04.200
if Groucho every time was like pretend I said something smart about Marxism here

09:04.200 --> 09:10.400
just doesn't know anything about it we'll get that in a post we do a lot of

09:10.400 --> 09:16.240
ADR on our live shows oh shit and so you see them smash the pie and you just

09:16.240 --> 09:22.240
think you get horny yeah no mine is like you you could fall asleep with that pie

09:22.240 --> 09:25.160
like it would be very oh like when you're at the aquarium you see the fish

09:25.160 --> 09:27.760
swimming around you like I just went dunk my head I just want to live it's

09:27.760 --> 09:31.260
refreshing mr. limp it in there you know what I mean I thought it was gonna be a

09:31.260 --> 09:35.440
horny thing for sure we can turn it into that should we make it a horny thing

09:35.440 --> 09:40.880
from this way can we take a hold on it's not an audience it is actually about to

09:40.880 --> 09:43.680
be can you the house that's on for a second I just want to see a quick show

09:43.680 --> 09:47.840
of hands on whether or not this question specifically is a sex thing and please

09:47.840 --> 09:53.800
raise your hand if you think that this person is asking about a sex that's

09:53.800 --> 10:00.800
maybe as 50-50 split I'm as surprised as anybody keep your hands up dirty birds

10:00.800 --> 10:06.600
okay I'm gonna say this though there's a weird okay when they sold you guys your

10:06.600 --> 10:11.480
tickets was there a like question on the website that was like pie stuff and if

10:11.480 --> 10:18.640
you said yes you had to go to the balcony cuz y'all's 100% over there if

10:18.640 --> 10:24.000
you want to fuck pies you go in the skies okay you can turn the lights off

10:24.000 --> 10:31.200
now I'm getting a run by how attractive they are I saw this hysterical movie

10:31.200 --> 10:41.840
once where there was a pie and a young man

10:41.840 --> 10:50.400
and his name I swear to God was stiffy and he did the damn thing to it and they

10:50.400 --> 10:57.080
called it the pie movie or something so can you give me a beat my beat recount

10:57.080 --> 11:05.160
well it opens with stiffy doing the damn thing and I imagine at that point most

11:05.160 --> 11:08.520
of the people just left the theater because they thought it was gonna be a

11:08.520 --> 11:13.960
fun Don McLean thing he did did he do the is that what the Don McLean songs

11:13.960 --> 11:22.640
about I hope so you think people get their noses broken a lot that way with

11:22.640 --> 11:26.240
the pie thing because it seems like you'd be so overzealous about like

11:26.240 --> 11:29.560
finally I got to do this thing I'm always wanted to do that you would slam

11:29.560 --> 11:33.640
it so hard you break that break the nose I mean with like a pecan pie yeah how

11:33.640 --> 11:38.840
many people how many people do you think a year die from pie to the face more

11:38.840 --> 11:41.880
more than you think more than you think how many people do you think died

11:41.880 --> 11:45.720
because someone didn't think about whether to use a hot filling pie or like

11:45.720 --> 11:51.040
a cold cream oh you gotta be careful you'll never get that out

11:51.040 --> 11:58.000
even the song cherry pie is about horny pie stuff for is it a simile just about

11:58.000 --> 12:06.360
pies it's a cherry pie smash it in my face in my mouth and eyes pretty good

12:06.360 --> 12:13.200
pretty good it's hot stick is sweet gonna smash it with my feet oh no wait

12:13.200 --> 12:18.880
you you've gone astray where now they should have another one called very

12:18.880 --> 12:31.800
weird out hey listen I didn't mean to yuck any yums there if you're into

12:31.800 --> 12:36.560
what's up copy with you I know there's no judgment here it must be a hard world

12:36.560 --> 12:41.440
out there and I'm here for you okay but nobody else is here's another question I

12:41.440 --> 12:45.040
work in a middle school and use a room that is shared by several other

12:45.040 --> 12:48.480
employees sometimes I have to leave my materials in there but usually it's safe

12:48.480 --> 12:53.040
however my favorite pin which has a quote on it from the hit Broadway

12:53.040 --> 12:59.120
musical Hamilton Hamilton went missing I assumed a student had taken it or thrown

12:59.120 --> 13:06.160
it away but later that week I saw my boss using my Hamilton pin how can I

13:06.160 --> 13:09.520
give it back without seeming like a dick and that's from missing musical

13:09.520 --> 13:19.920
merchandise kill him somebody says Wow whoa it's a super musical but and I'm

13:19.920 --> 13:23.680
now worried that like tomorrow this boss is gonna end up dead for completely

13:23.680 --> 13:30.040
unrelated reasons the charming boys on stage said not to kill anybody don't

13:30.040 --> 13:35.640
kill him if you're a reporter that's the story okay everybody tweet that out are

13:35.640 --> 13:40.200
you here a person who had their pencil on yes that was actually sorry that was

13:40.200 --> 13:44.840
actually a wailing cry of sadness they're here and they're having their

13:44.840 --> 13:48.080
soul ripped from their body by a mystical gem

13:48.080 --> 13:58.160
so just did a fatality on somebody in our fucking audience I mean let me ask

13:58.160 --> 14:02.360
you this well what Hamilton do he would write his way out with his own fucking

14:02.360 --> 14:05.920
pin that he would go get back from this person you could do that you go to him

14:05.920 --> 14:12.680
be like hey I I'm gonna write my way out but there's one thing all right don't

14:12.680 --> 14:21.440
have a pen help me out oh I solved it go to them see the pen note the pen say to

14:21.440 --> 14:28.560
them oh you into Hamilton then the trap is set yeah cuz then they'll have to be

14:28.560 --> 14:34.160
like yeah so much that I got a pen and lie or to and if they do that then you

14:34.160 --> 14:39.160
gotta ask for what lyrics favorite song like their favorite bit from it like uh

14:39.160 --> 14:49.440
mr. president huff huff my shorts if you think I couldn't even do one like fake

14:49.440 --> 14:55.080
bar of a yeah but what if it turns out they aren't also just a super big like

14:55.080 --> 14:59.440
I mean odds are they're probably a pretty big a little niche number that

14:59.440 --> 15:02.080
only this works but no if they're like yeah and they just do word-for-word

15:02.080 --> 15:07.880
start to finish the whole musical it's like okay keep it you in here's a fun

15:07.880 --> 15:12.400
here's a funny suggestion for a comedy podcast go to them and say that's my pen

15:12.400 --> 15:20.160
I like it I paid money for that and I'd like it back it's mine I bought mine pin

15:20.160 --> 15:24.820
and I'd like it back why don't you people ever try that before you come to

15:24.820 --> 15:28.480
us it's just like maybe they did maybe they went the box like that's my beddy

15:28.480 --> 15:35.600

15:41.840 --> 15:47.680
way cuz we'd sort that shit out right quick yeah wait are you here and you're

15:47.680 --> 15:51.560

podcast within a podcast

20:31.720 --> 20:37.660
the headline of this USA Today story and I'm putting USA Today on blast on this

20:37.660 --> 20:48.040
one too it's no you're not at Panera McDonald's introduces new artisanal

okay try trying something new huh well fuck you fuck you McDonald's yeah no

20:59.800 --> 21:03.600
you're not Panera what they're saying is that you could eat a sandwich at

21:03.600 --> 21:08.240
McDonald's and be tricked into thinking you're at Panera which is like if that's

21:08.240 --> 21:12.200
all I thought you said no you're not Panera you know you're not at Panera

21:12.200 --> 21:17.920
okay I don't think you hit that at enough that's um hey if that's your

21:17.920 --> 21:23.840
range that's a pretty wild range of thing I mean it's no Panera it's

21:23.840 --> 21:29.160
McDonald's but it's no Panera and that would also imply that you walked in just

21:29.160 --> 21:34.280
like blinders on did not look at any surroundings ordered sandwich hey and

21:34.280 --> 21:42.920

story the Panera clown Pinero he's got the balloons for the children folks the

21:54.020 --> 22:00.240
golden arches are going artisanal that's the head that's the lead from USA Today

22:00.240 --> 22:03.600
McDonald's introduced three new sandwiches on May 1st and the menu

22:03.600 --> 22:10.920

chicken or the trio marks the chain's nationwide launch of its signature

22:38.540 --> 22:42.400
crafted recipes long you motherfuckers can put words like that together however

22:42.400 --> 22:48.280
many ways you want no one's fooled no one is for artisanal market fret fuck

22:48.280 --> 22:53.200
you like no one is full it's McDonald I saw another story where I was looking

22:53.200 --> 22:56.640
for this one that said that McDonald's pledges to have fresh beef quarter

22:56.640 --> 23:05.840
pounders by the middle of 2018 so we're just gonna spend a year kicking it your

23:05.840 --> 23:10.040
old meat that you've alerted us to those motherfuckers said they're gonna

23:10.040 --> 23:19.120
let us have cage-free eggs by I shit you not 2025 we gotta find them yeah we're

23:19.120 --> 23:23.320
gonna have caged read a cage reacts before the heat death of the universe

23:23.320 --> 23:31.480
that's our pledge to you signed Ronald McDonald fuck you guys quote from Chris

23:31.480 --> 23:37.480
Kempinski he's the president of McDonald's USA signature establishes a

23:37.480 --> 23:44.200
premium range on our menu showcasing high quality burger and chicken products

23:44.200 --> 23:53.120
with more food forward ingredients what hey guys I got a new thing we should try

23:53.120 --> 24:00.960
to think about first and that's food we by the way I should take a quick sidebar

24:00.960 --> 24:06.280
I did get to try these in a test market in Columbus and what the fuck wait no

24:06.280 --> 24:12.040
this is unprecedented we the quote continues from Chris we need to bring

24:12.040 --> 24:18.160
more food news like this in order to appeal to millennial customers who are

24:18.160 --> 24:26.000
seeking who are seeking new taste experiences these days okay there's pico

24:26.000 --> 24:30.760
on one of these sandwiches sorry there's a pico element on one of these bad boys

24:30.760 --> 24:37.120
that is a new experience of McDonald's salsa boy I love being born in the late

24:37.120 --> 24:43.000
80s to early thousands it makes me want McDonald's salsa what the fuck's wrong

24:43.000 --> 24:52.800
with me I can't buy a house but boy what's a McDonald's a salsa CBS

24:52.800 --> 24:57.000
irrationally hates me but that's okay cuz I can numb that pain with my good

24:57.000 --> 25:05.000
McDonald's salsa you know this is the end of the quote and it's I'm pretty

25:05.000 --> 25:11.600
sure it's a threat you should expect us to step up our level of menu innovation

25:11.600 --> 25:18.640
in the u.s. in the years ahead that's coming for you Justin McElroy yeah

25:18.640 --> 25:23.440
that's a fun thing of like to think that I'm gonna spend the next few years

25:23.440 --> 25:28.160
somewhere in my head like I wouldn't when McDonald's steps up their

25:28.160 --> 25:31.920
innovation I'm ready for it because they did warn me that for the years ahead

25:31.920 --> 25:36.080
they're gonna be dipping their toes in and this was a news story published in

25:36.080 --> 25:41.760
USA Today yeah this is a drag this is all I'm quoting directly McDonald's move

25:41.760 --> 25:48.280
is the Panera ization stop of the more down market chain no more for value and

25:48.280 --> 25:51.880
convenience in creative flavor combinations hey USA Today thanks for

25:51.880 --> 26:00.400
the elevator pitch on McDonald's go on and it's cheap too do you think that

26:00.400 --> 26:04.240
that journalist walked into the editor's office and was like I've got an idea for

26:04.240 --> 26:09.800
a story you'll never believe what McDonald's is up to

26:10.240 --> 26:15.480
this is there more fast casual is a stolen market share from the fast food

26:15.480 --> 26:19.340
segment said Jack Russo as senior analyst who covers McDonald's at

26:19.340 --> 26:24.320
Deborah Jones cool job cool job when you see that's a competitor you think well

26:24.320 --> 26:27.920
we can't completely transform who we are but we can steal some pages from their

26:27.920 --> 26:32.800
playbook and then this guy goes into like why they why they can't make them

26:32.800 --> 26:42.740
too good cuz it'd be expensive just like mom's kitchen that's too much money no

26:42.740 --> 26:49.200
you get the weird pico de gallo can I do this other Yahoo yeah this is also

26:49.200 --> 26:53.280

Davenport thank you true it is sadly germane yahoo answers user VA 2906 asks

40:31.360 --> 40:37.000
what would it be like if humans were in a constant state of orgasm would it even

40:37.000 --> 40:40.600
be possible to drive a car

40:45.080 --> 40:59.240
somebody's yelling yes yes so I'm thinking you would actually probably

40:59.240 --> 41:02.200
just establish that was your new baseline right like you would get you

41:02.200 --> 41:14.120
eventually would you get used to it it's good to see you hey hey Frank you

41:29.600 --> 41:34.160
question is so irrelevant it's like do you want to go to the movies and see

41:34.160 --> 41:47.240
avatar not at all I'm good that's and that's what that bands all about that's

41:47.240 --> 41:52.480
what ten roof rusted means what is it no it does it means I'm always orgasmic

41:52.480 --> 41:59.400

41:59.400 --> 42:04.160
never invented anything we wouldn't have invented the car certainly certainly not

42:04.160 --> 42:09.480

42:29.680 --> 42:36.960
good ones okay wait what I've been this reverse mirror world when humans

42:36.960 --> 42:53.080
orgasm was the only time they had like a moment's peace let's see it just be

42:53.080 --> 43:20.200

sure they were pity holes yeah this poor sad person what do you say we do some

46:27.680 --> 46:32.160
audience questions we're gonna call on folks I know we just put mics out but

46:32.160 --> 46:36.600
don't it's not a TED talk please don't line up behind them I'll call out from

46:36.600 --> 46:41.600
the left side okay I see somebody at the end pointing to

46:41.600 --> 46:48.520
themselves yes you yes in the hoodie yes yes you've done it hi what's your

46:48.520 --> 46:55.360
name hi Alexa I work remotely and we have lots of conference calls with

46:55.360 --> 47:03.640
people that I don't interface with mm-hmm some of them are older and don't

47:03.640 --> 47:08.760
use normal terminology and one of the women on my team refers to people who

47:08.760 --> 47:14.000
are not very intelligent as who has

47:14.000 --> 47:25.360
so refers to dumb people as who house yeah like this who ha okay I'm so

47:25.360 --> 47:32.440
delighted right now is there a question are you just like my co-workers so cool

47:32.440 --> 47:37.480
no I feel obligated to say something hey look in that deep dark truthful mirror

47:37.480 --> 47:41.560
do you really feel obligated to say something because if you did wouldn't be

47:41.560 --> 47:55.160
asking us yeah look at me right now you don't do you what would you say that's

47:55.160 --> 47:59.000
a really delicate question yeah it is a really delicate request yeah I think

47:59.000 --> 48:03.800
that we live in a world where sometimes joy can be hard to come by and if you

48:03.800 --> 48:10.800
if you ruin this font of pure light for people you have to live with that for

48:10.800 --> 48:17.600
all of your days is what I think this is an important person this means something

48:17.600 --> 48:25.080
if you work with a person who says things like who has or erroneously uses

48:25.080 --> 48:33.160
the term bust a nut which we've talked about before and you change them and

48:33.160 --> 48:39.280
that you've taken something from me you know cuz I might run into that person at

48:39.280 --> 48:43.680
Trader Joe's one day and literally bump into them and they're like hey watch out

48:43.680 --> 48:50.960
you who are maybe so angry I'm gonna bust a nut and I'm like thank you does

48:50.960 --> 48:57.000

49:35.960 --> 49:41.480
half years okay and years and so like I feel like I have to justify when I'm I'm

49:41.480 --> 49:44.400
a younger person and so people are like oh that's so sweet you've been together

49:44.400 --> 49:49.160

49:49.160 --> 49:53.680

are you a button by the way your bedroom button you are you have to tell

50:24.640 --> 50:31.880

my husband's family's from Arizona okay and we've been together not as much of

51:46.040 --> 51:52.120
a response from that we've been together five years now and his mom refers to a

51:52.120 --> 51:59.920
lot of things that's who has not not correctly so here cause cult she calls

51:59.920 --> 52:07.760

52:07.760 --> 52:14.280
things in the last three days go on I really really want to correct her but he

52:14.280 --> 52:18.140
says just let it go yeah I don't know if I should just let it go as she's my

52:18.140 --> 52:26.440
mother yeah I think she's doing it on purpose

52:26.440 --> 52:32.280
oh yeah our play thank you Travis that is of course the

52:32.280 --> 52:38.080
correct answer yeah you're under psychic assault making words sound funny is

52:38.080 --> 52:41.480
funny it's a thing that you do to entertain yourself she knows it's

52:41.480 --> 52:45.080
collages she's the person who's been in the world for a number of years but she

52:45.080 --> 52:55.480
says kolach keys cuz why not we're all gonna die someday so say shit wrong I

52:55.480 --> 53:00.080

sounds good no listen there's nothing to be game here I mean there's like

53:16.960 --> 53:20.800
literally nothing to begin just like let it slide cuz there you it is a no-win

53:20.800 --> 53:24.380
scenario for you to try to correct this person just let it happen I know it's

53:24.380 --> 53:29.680
painful but it's not your problem also nothing you have to worry about does

53:29.680 --> 53:34.480
that and that was a neutral one I know I didn't help it was part of the course

53:34.480 --> 53:41.240
okay sorry sorry we'll get a chance time I see somebody wearing a white short

53:41.240 --> 53:48.040

how many people wearing white shirts that wanted to ask questions we're

54:05.760 --> 54:09.400

last summer I had to go by my last name it's kind of weird last name and a bunch

54:28.120 --> 54:30.880
of the younger kids like the youngest kids we get are like six or seven or

54:30.880 --> 54:33.960
whatever and they're like stay there for three nights and they all gave me a

54:33.960 --> 54:38.200
really embarrassing nickname because some of like I had another girl on

54:38.200 --> 54:42.440
staff who had the same first name as me so she got first name dibs for some

54:42.440 --> 54:51.480
reason that sucks so all the little kids started calling me Rhino mom whoa what

54:51.480 --> 54:54.800

54:54.800 --> 54:59.520
girl's not on staff this summer and how do I become how do I rename myself I

54:59.520 --> 55:06.120
want to rebrand yeah how old are these kids again um they range from like six

55:06.120 --> 55:16.680
and seven to like 18 yeah you can tell an 18 year old like don't call me Rhino

55:16.680 --> 55:22.960

55:37.360 --> 55:42.840

not your opportunity to experiment with growing facial hair and I said fuck this

55:46.760 --> 55:56.840
