00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:31.840
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:31.840 --> 00:48.000
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother, my brother and me, an advice show for the modern

00:48.000 --> 00:53.600
era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I, let me check my notes, I'm your middle

00:53.600 --> 00:56.160
brother Travis McElroy. And I'm your sweet baby Griffin.

00:56.160 --> 00:57.520
Okay. Dang.

00:57.520 --> 01:01.760
Sorry guys, there seems to be some sort of lag on the Skype, and I stepped all over Travis's

01:01.760 --> 01:06.240
dick on that one, and I'll own it. Is there lag on the Skype,

01:06.240 --> 01:08.720
or are you just going, man? There's lag on the Skype, man.

01:09.440 --> 01:12.160
There's, okay, Griffin, lag on the Skype doesn't- Yeah, it's wild, man, because I'm

01:12.160 --> 01:16.240
talking and I hear nothing. Okay, but the lag would make you talk sooner.

01:16.240 --> 01:21.120
When I hear the words, they're after, when I, they get finished by the time I speak.

01:21.120 --> 01:25.200
It can't, lag doesn't work. No, that would mean, like it's time traveling

01:25.200 --> 01:29.040
lag that makes it sooner for you. Guys, I was playing Quake when you were

01:29.040 --> 01:32.720
still Quaking in your fucking diapers, okay? I know all about lag, so don't come to me

01:32.720 --> 01:35.200
and tell me about lag. Check your ping.

01:35.200 --> 01:40.000
Check your ping, you freaking nerds. This is going to be a tough record if I'm

01:40.000 --> 01:42.640
hearing everything you say before you finish saying it.

01:42.640 --> 01:45.600
And this is your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

01:45.600 --> 01:48.560
And welcome to Sawbones. And this is Griffin McElroy,

01:48.560 --> 01:52.080
30 under 30, see that time it was fucking perfect for me.

01:52.080 --> 01:55.040
That one was okay, huh? It's possible I've become unstuck in time.

01:55.040 --> 01:57.280
Okay, not again. Good one, Juice.

01:57.280 --> 02:03.520
Oh God, I didn't do any jokes yet on this one. Maybe just hit shuffle play on this episode

02:03.520 --> 02:06.480
and see how that works. Yeah, you know how that's a feature that's

02:06.480 --> 02:10.400
on most podcast apps? Well, they'll just play 10 seconds at a time,

02:10.400 --> 02:13.200
just a random little sliver, random little cross section.

02:13.840 --> 02:17.760
So I guess it seems like we all had individual bits we were going to do for the opening.

02:17.760 --> 02:22.240
I was going to make a joke about Wick watchers, just people who watch John Wick.

02:23.040 --> 02:26.560
And I was going to talk about like, what do you guys think is in the new John Wick movie?

02:26.560 --> 02:29.120
Because I haven't seen it. And what kind of fun stuff do you think he does?

02:29.120 --> 02:33.840
I think he goes to an arcade where he uses the special coins to play Giant Claw Machine.

02:33.840 --> 02:38.160
Travis, you should see the new John Wick film is one thing I would tell you.

02:38.160 --> 02:41.200
Oh, okay. Well, I do plan, I have joined Wick watchers.

02:41.200 --> 02:45.200
So my plan is to watch the new John Wick film, Justin.

02:45.200 --> 02:53.680
So in your canon, is Wick watchers people who have seen it or people who are planning to seeing it?

02:53.680 --> 02:58.400
I think it's people who have to sort of ration how much they can see it.

02:59.280 --> 03:04.800
I just watched John Wick 2, that's four points. And I have a budget of six points today.

03:04.800 --> 03:06.720
So I can watch half of one if I want.

03:07.520 --> 03:11.520
And I think it, because we only get like one John Wick a year now.

03:12.080 --> 03:16.000
And you don't want to burn out on it too much. So you get six points a day.

03:17.280 --> 03:20.320
If you watch John Wick 1, that's five points.

03:20.320 --> 03:24.400
Yeah. And then if you watch the new John Wick, that's all your sex.

03:24.960 --> 03:27.440
John Wick 2, you can watch that one. That's four points.

03:27.440 --> 03:31.520
I mean, the fucking train knife fight with common alone is three points.

03:33.200 --> 03:35.920
Yeah, that's three of the four points. There's a lot.

03:35.920 --> 03:37.440
What was your bit, Justin?

03:37.440 --> 03:40.080
Me? I didn't have one. My bit comes later.

03:40.080 --> 03:41.280
Oh, okay.

03:41.280 --> 03:45.520
I got a new bit. It's a new segment that I'm really excited about.

03:45.520 --> 03:46.720
Well, why not just do it now?

03:47.440 --> 03:47.920
Do you think?

03:47.920 --> 03:50.240
Do you think? I think the time is right.

03:50.240 --> 03:53.040
And I think that it's been a while since we've done any funny stuff.

03:53.040 --> 03:53.360
All right.

03:56.080 --> 03:58.640
Excuse me, everybody. This is Justin McElroy.

03:58.640 --> 04:03.520
Just wanted to come in over the radio here to inform you that it is pilot season.

04:04.800 --> 04:05.360
That's really good.

04:05.360 --> 04:07.280
Hey, everybody. Welcome to our new bit.

04:07.840 --> 04:08.960
My new bit.

04:08.960 --> 04:11.600
My new personal bit that we can do once a year.

04:12.400 --> 04:14.240
And it's called pilot season.

04:14.240 --> 04:14.720
Oh, good.

04:14.720 --> 04:18.880
And what it is is, this is an advice show for them.

04:18.880 --> 04:19.680
Did we say that?

04:19.680 --> 04:21.920
No, no, no. We just jumped right into the time traveling.

04:21.920 --> 04:24.560
This is my brother, my brother and me. It's an advice show for the modern era.

04:24.560 --> 04:26.960
Justin is me. Travis is the middle one.

04:26.960 --> 04:28.800
The little squeaky fellas, Griffin.

04:28.800 --> 04:29.840
And we do advice.

04:29.840 --> 04:31.520
But right now it's pilot season.

04:31.520 --> 04:35.280
And we're going to walk you through some of the shows that are coming your way.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.760
Did you just eat some saltwater trape?

04:38.320 --> 04:40.080
No, that's the pilot voice, Travis.

04:40.080 --> 04:40.720
Sorry, sorry.

04:40.720 --> 04:44.880
Today, we're going to be going into some network dramas.

04:44.880 --> 04:47.040
And this is an interactive segment.

04:47.040 --> 04:53.120
I'm going to tell you the name of the series and sort of the log line.

04:53.120 --> 04:58.560
Maybe even some of the stars of the film and the TV series.

04:58.560 --> 04:59.360
Not a film.

04:59.360 --> 05:02.080
It's like a film, like short film, like several short films.

05:02.080 --> 05:06.560
Well, it's like one big fucking long film that they cut up into a bunch of little parts.

05:06.560 --> 05:07.920
It's up to you to decide.

05:07.920 --> 05:13.680
Anyway, so I'm going to give you the name of it, the characters, whatever.

05:13.680 --> 05:18.080
And I want you guys to tell me if one of three things are happening.

05:18.080 --> 05:19.520
One, it was ordered a series.

05:20.160 --> 05:21.280
Two, passed over.

05:22.000 --> 05:27.200
Three, some form of sent back to the woodshed for the workshop,

05:27.200 --> 05:30.720
the proverbial workshop for a little bit of retooling.

05:30.720 --> 05:31.280
Okay.

05:31.280 --> 05:31.780
Okay.

05:32.320 --> 05:34.560
First up is the ABC dramas.

05:34.560 --> 05:37.760
Now, this is not all the ABC dramas that are coming.

05:37.760 --> 05:43.840
But it is some of the ABC dramas that were put up for pilot season.

05:45.440 --> 05:47.440
First is called Heart of Life.

05:48.240 --> 05:48.880
Logline.

05:50.000 --> 05:50.960
Logline.

05:50.960 --> 06:00.720
Inspired by John Mayer's song, this drama follows two sets of adult siblings from wildly

06:00.720 --> 06:06.320
different worlds who discovered they are related and must reassess everything they thought

06:06.320 --> 06:08.320
they knew about their shared father.

06:08.960 --> 06:14.080
As they explore the mystery of their separate childhoods, they'll experience the difficulty

06:14.080 --> 06:19.520
in overcoming the sins of the past and learn the joys of reuniting with lost family.

06:20.160 --> 06:20.400
Yeah.

06:20.400 --> 06:21.840
I think that one's a skip-a-rooney.

06:21.840 --> 06:23.680
I think that one did not make it.

06:23.680 --> 06:26.480
That's inspired by John Mayer's song.

06:26.480 --> 06:26.960
Yeah.

06:26.960 --> 06:30.720
I'm going to also guess a big old skip though on that one.

06:31.440 --> 06:33.040
That's being redeveloped.

06:33.040 --> 06:34.400
They like some of it.

06:34.400 --> 06:35.120
Yeah.

06:35.120 --> 06:36.400
Some of that's pretty good.

06:36.400 --> 06:37.600
We like the John Mayer stuff.

06:37.600 --> 06:37.760
Yeah.

06:37.760 --> 06:40.720
I should have followed my gut there because I liked some of that.

06:41.840 --> 06:43.520
Some of that is good.

06:43.520 --> 06:45.600
Some of that was real nice for me.

06:45.600 --> 06:47.520
It hit the ears in a real pleasing way.

06:48.160 --> 06:53.840
So this next one from ABC drama, the ABC drama stable, is called A Hypnotist's Love Story.

06:53.840 --> 06:54.400
The Hypnotist's Love Story.

06:54.400 --> 06:56.160
The titles need some help.

06:56.160 --> 07:00.160
Maybe that's what needs reworking because Heart of Life, is that what it was?

07:00.160 --> 07:00.960
Heart of Love?

07:01.600 --> 07:01.920
It's not.

07:01.920 --> 07:02.560
Heart of Life.

07:02.560 --> 07:03.360
Okay.

07:03.360 --> 07:03.920
Heart of Life.

07:03.920 --> 07:05.920
Hard to remember.

07:05.920 --> 07:07.120
The Hypnotist's Love Story.

07:08.000 --> 07:08.480
Logline.

07:09.040 --> 07:16.000
After a string of failed romances, successful hypnotherapist Ellen is optimistic about her

07:16.000 --> 07:19.520
current boyfriend, but then he reveals a disturbing truth.

07:20.320 --> 07:25.280
A stalker ex-girlfriend, played by Heather Graham, has been following him for years.

07:25.280 --> 07:29.680
Ellen finds herself intrigued and oddly thrilled by the stalker,

07:29.680 --> 07:32.400
entirely unaware that they've already met.

07:32.400 --> 07:34.800
So this is a drama?

07:34.800 --> 07:40.000
It's a drama about a super good hypnotist that dates a guy who's got a stalker,

07:40.000 --> 07:43.040
but the hypnotist loves it until she doesn't.

07:43.040 --> 07:45.920
I'm confused as to how that's a series.

07:45.920 --> 07:47.840
It's based on a novel, I think.

07:47.840 --> 07:51.920
But that seems like less than one episode.

07:51.920 --> 07:53.760
How's that gonna get six seasons in a movie?

07:53.760 --> 07:54.400
You tell me.

07:54.400 --> 07:54.800
I don't know.

07:54.800 --> 07:57.360
I mean, okay, we got Heather Graham attached, so that's a pickup.

07:57.360 --> 07:58.480
That's a pickup day one.

07:59.280 --> 08:00.320
Scrappy-doo.

08:00.320 --> 08:02.640
I'm gonna say it's a pass.

08:02.640 --> 08:03.520
That's a pass.

08:03.520 --> 08:04.320
Correct, Travis.

08:04.320 --> 08:05.840
That's a hard pass.

08:05.840 --> 08:10.640
Next, series in the ABC drama stable is NYPD Blue.

08:10.640 --> 08:11.680
I shit you not.

08:11.680 --> 08:12.180
Wait.

08:12.960 --> 08:21.040
It follows Andy Sipowicz's son Theo as he tries to earn his detective shield and work

08:21.040 --> 08:28.560
in the 15th squad while investigating his father's murder, and that's NYPD Blue.

08:28.560 --> 08:31.200
Now, should they have called it NYPD 2?

08:31.200 --> 08:31.440
Yes.

08:31.440 --> 08:32.480
Of course they should have.

08:32.480 --> 08:32.480
Yes.

08:32.480 --> 08:33.280
That's obvious.

08:34.080 --> 08:35.360
Obvious to anybody.

08:35.360 --> 08:36.880
What's happening with this show?

08:36.880 --> 08:37.760
Pick it up, baby.

08:37.760 --> 08:38.880
It's NYPD Blue.

08:38.880 --> 08:40.880
Yeah, I'm gonna say that's an obvious pickup.

08:40.880 --> 08:41.680
Obvious pickup.

08:41.680 --> 08:43.440
Being redeveloped.

08:43.440 --> 08:46.480
It's NYPD Blue.

08:46.480 --> 08:48.240
It's NYPD Blue 2.

08:48.240 --> 08:49.760
They're gonna do it again.

08:49.760 --> 08:50.480
Triangle.

08:51.200 --> 08:55.840
Guys, what if the Bermuda Triangle was not a watery grave in the middle of the ocean,

08:55.840 --> 09:00.800
but a land lost in time that has trapped travelers over the course of human history?

09:00.800 --> 09:04.640
When a family is shipwrecked in this strange land, they must band together with a group

09:04.640 --> 09:10.080
of like-minded inhabitants from throughout history to survive and somehow find a way home.

09:10.640 --> 09:12.480
It's a series called Triangle.

09:12.480 --> 09:16.160
Now, everyone knows that the Bermuda Triangle is in the middle of the ocean, but what my

09:16.160 --> 09:18.480
book presupposes is maybe it isn't.

09:20.240 --> 09:23.840
I'm gonna say that's a go into series because I would like to watch it.

09:23.840 --> 09:25.680
I would watch that very bad.

09:25.680 --> 09:28.160
I know you nasty boys would watch it.

09:28.160 --> 09:31.600
It is in contention for mid-season consideration.

09:31.600 --> 09:36.880
Haven't made a decision on this one yet, but ABC, you pounce or I'm gonna kickstart it

09:36.880 --> 09:37.600
for myself.

09:37.600 --> 09:38.400
Hey, big news.

09:38.400 --> 09:43.760
The McElroy brothers have started their own major television network so that we can pick

09:43.760 --> 09:44.640
up Triangle.

09:45.520 --> 09:52.400
It's called Bebo and it's got all the alt-comedy you crave and Triangle, poached from ABC this

09:52.400 --> 09:52.880
fall.

09:52.880 --> 09:53.360
Fuck them.

09:53.360 --> 09:59.600
We're gonna go over to CBS and CBS is where the old people play and that's where they

09:59.600 --> 10:03.440
like to get nasty and do their old stuff with none of the young people watching.

10:03.440 --> 10:05.680
No cell phones allowed over at CBS.

10:05.680 --> 10:06.480
That's what it's called.

10:06.480 --> 10:07.440
No cell phones allowed.

10:08.160 --> 10:12.160
So we're gonna get nasty over there to find the most boring series available.

10:13.360 --> 10:14.800
Tommy is the first one.

10:14.800 --> 10:20.480
When a former high-ranking NYPD officer played by Edie Falco becomes the first female chief

10:20.480 --> 10:26.960
of police for Los Angeles, she uses her unflinching honesty and hardball tactics to navigate the

10:26.960 --> 10:31.120
social, political, and national security issues that converge with enforcing the law.

10:31.920 --> 10:33.280
Yeah, that's a cop show.

10:33.280 --> 10:34.240
I've heard of that.

10:34.240 --> 10:35.840
A cop show with Edie Falco.

10:38.080 --> 10:41.360
It's called Tommy, but it was formerly known as Nancy.

10:41.360 --> 10:45.600
So I guess they just decided to call her something different on this one.

10:45.600 --> 10:48.080
Then I don't think they're done fixing this one up.

10:48.080 --> 10:50.640
I think it's back in the woodshed.

10:50.640 --> 10:51.840
I'm gonna say a pickup.

10:53.120 --> 10:54.880
It's absolutely a pickup, Travis.

10:54.880 --> 10:56.640
God, your instincts are so good.

10:56.640 --> 10:58.160
Of course, Edie Falco.

10:58.800 --> 11:00.160
As a hard-nosed cop?

11:00.160 --> 11:00.720
Yeah.

11:00.720 --> 11:03.360
Hard-nosed cop turned judge for the old to love it.

11:03.360 --> 11:04.160
All Rise.

11:04.720 --> 11:06.000
Formerly courthouse.

11:06.800 --> 11:08.560
Follows the dedicated chaotic-

11:08.560 --> 11:09.520
Formerly what?

11:10.320 --> 11:12.480
Former- All Rise is the name of it now.

11:13.120 --> 11:14.320
Not Paul Reiser.

11:14.320 --> 11:15.440
That's a different series.

11:15.440 --> 11:16.240
All Rise.

11:16.240 --> 11:16.720
Okay.

11:16.720 --> 11:18.720
Formerly courthouse.

11:18.720 --> 11:20.480
Are we still talking about the same show?

11:20.480 --> 11:22.080
Is that the name of the, stop.

11:22.080 --> 11:22.480
Nah.

11:22.480 --> 11:24.800
Is it colon formerly courthouse?

11:25.440 --> 11:25.760
No.

11:25.760 --> 11:28.480
Oh, the name of the thing used to be courthouse, now it's-

11:28.480 --> 11:30.400
Courthouse, right, okay.

11:30.400 --> 11:32.960
It follows the dedicated, chaotic, hopeful,

11:32.960 --> 11:35.920
and sometimes absurd lives of the judges,

11:35.920 --> 11:38.560
assistant district attorneys, and public defenders

11:38.560 --> 11:41.440
as they work with bailiffs, clerks, cops, and jurors

11:41.440 --> 11:43.920
to bring justice to the people of Los Angeles.

11:43.920 --> 11:44.320
Sexy.

11:44.320 --> 11:48.320
I started playing Pokemon Go in the middle of that description.

11:48.320 --> 11:49.600
It was so fucking boring.

11:49.600 --> 11:51.120
Well, no, that's why they changed it to All Right,

11:51.120 --> 11:52.080
because courthouse, ooh,

11:52.080 --> 11:53.920
but All Rise makes it sound like boner.

11:53.920 --> 11:55.840
It used to be called courthouse.

11:56.640 --> 11:58.720
Courthouse, I guess.

12:00.240 --> 12:01.280
Oh, that's great.

12:01.280 --> 12:03.760
Oh man, we need more shows named after the buildings

12:03.760 --> 12:04.720
that they're in.

12:04.720 --> 12:06.720
About all these young, sexy judges,

12:06.720 --> 12:08.880
and district attorneys, and court stenographers.

12:08.880 --> 12:10.400
What's happening with this show?

12:10.400 --> 12:12.320
What's happening with this show on CBS drama?

12:12.320 --> 12:13.920
I'm gonna say that's a pickup, Justin.

12:13.920 --> 12:16.560
Yeah, now I don't think CBS gives a shit.

12:16.560 --> 12:17.360
That's a pickup.

12:18.160 --> 12:19.600
That is a pickup.

12:19.600 --> 12:19.840
Yeah.

12:21.120 --> 12:23.760
You'll be able to watch that on TV, damn.

12:24.400 --> 12:27.200
Do you understand, though, that Tommy is about

12:27.200 --> 12:29.760
the first female chief of police for Los Angeles,

12:29.760 --> 12:32.960
and All Rise is about the district attorneys,

12:32.960 --> 12:34.720
and judges, and public defenders,

12:34.720 --> 12:37.040
and clerks, and cops in Los Angeles?

12:37.040 --> 12:41.120
It's like they literally are starting two simultaneous

12:41.120 --> 12:43.840
the sprint takes on the legal system and law schedule.

12:43.840 --> 12:46.960
This is our LAPDCU.

12:47.920 --> 12:49.760
Yeah, but the McElroy brothers get six episodes.

12:49.760 --> 12:50.320
That's what they get.

12:50.320 --> 12:51.520
They get six episodes.

12:51.520 --> 12:52.240
I'm not bitter.

12:52.240 --> 12:54.640
I'm just saying there's a lot of TV money flowing

12:54.640 --> 12:56.400
around here, and then you maybe could kick us some.

12:57.120 --> 12:58.720
Okay, so this is CBS shows.

12:58.720 --> 13:00.320
I just wrote you two of the most boring things

13:00.320 --> 13:02.240
I've ever had to read on this podcast.

13:02.240 --> 13:03.280
Both ordered a series.

13:04.000 --> 13:07.840
The Republic of Sarah, a small New Hampshire town,

13:07.840 --> 13:10.240
is thrust onto the world stage with the discovery

13:10.240 --> 13:12.400
of a valuable resource within its borders,

13:12.400 --> 13:14.320
compels the residents to declare themselves

13:14.320 --> 13:17.680
an independent nation, setting the unlikely young mayor

13:17.680 --> 13:19.280
and her cabinet of inexperienced locals

13:19.280 --> 13:21.600
on the path to running a brand new country,

13:21.600 --> 13:23.040
the Republic of Sarah.

13:23.040 --> 13:24.240
What the fuck?

13:24.240 --> 13:25.520
Holy shit.

13:25.520 --> 13:27.520
Seditious, but it's fun.

13:27.520 --> 13:28.560
Is it a drama?

13:29.120 --> 13:31.680
Is this still a drama, or is this a comedy?

13:31.680 --> 13:34.000
Still the drama section in this one.

13:34.000 --> 13:37.120
Maybe more of a dramedy, but this is a drama.

13:37.120 --> 13:38.320
I mean, it's a short show.

13:38.320 --> 13:42.080
The fucking full force of the military rolls over them.

13:42.080 --> 13:43.360
Sprout down on them.

13:43.360 --> 13:46.080
Yeah, it's like they've got unobtainium there.

13:46.080 --> 13:47.840
And keep this for ourselves.

13:47.840 --> 13:49.200
Uh, no, you didn't.

13:49.200 --> 13:50.160
Oh, okay.

13:50.160 --> 13:52.240
It's like under the dome, but without the dome.

13:52.240 --> 13:54.080
So the military's just like,

13:54.080 --> 13:55.840
I guess we'll kill all of you then?

13:55.840 --> 13:57.760
We'll just come and take what we want.

13:57.760 --> 13:59.280
What's happened with this series though

13:59.280 --> 14:00.400
that sounds so cool and fun?

14:00.400 --> 14:01.920
I'm gonna say it's a pass, Justin.

14:01.920 --> 14:03.120
I think they can fix this up.

14:03.120 --> 14:04.320
I like some of the stuff in there.

14:04.880 --> 14:06.000
It's a hard pass.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.280
Son of a, oh my god.

14:07.280 --> 14:09.600
Why is Travis so fucking good at this?

14:09.600 --> 14:10.960
Travis is fucking great at this.

14:10.960 --> 14:13.600
Now here's the one that this was the,

14:13.600 --> 14:17.520
I was casually perusing this article on,

14:17.520 --> 14:19.280
I don't know, Hollywood Reporter, whatever it was.

14:19.280 --> 14:21.200
And this is the one that made me decide

14:21.200 --> 14:23.200
that we should probably talk about these.

14:24.160 --> 14:27.760
A San Francisco homicide detective is,

14:27.760 --> 14:29.200
this is called Alive.

14:29.200 --> 14:31.280
And I'll tell you what it used to be called after.

14:32.080 --> 14:34.320
A San Francisco homicide detective

14:34.320 --> 14:36.560
is mysteriously brought back to life

14:36.560 --> 14:38.720
after being killed in the line of duty.

14:38.720 --> 14:40.880
But as he resumes his own life,

14:40.880 --> 14:43.760
and he and his wife realize he isn't the same person

14:43.760 --> 14:46.880
he used to be, they zero in on the strange man

14:46.880 --> 14:48.240
behind his resurrection.

14:48.240 --> 14:49.280
What is his name?

14:49.280 --> 14:50.160
Travis, what's his name?

14:50.160 --> 14:50.800
Lazarus.

14:51.520 --> 14:53.840
No, no, what's the name of the strange man

14:53.840 --> 14:54.960
behind his resurrection?

14:54.960 --> 14:56.720
It's Dr. Victor Frankenstein.

14:56.720 --> 14:59.680
It says here, Ryan Phillipe stars in Alive,

14:59.680 --> 15:04.080
formerly called fucking Frankenstein the Cop Show.

15:04.080 --> 15:06.560
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

15:06.560 --> 15:07.120
Hold up.

15:07.120 --> 15:10.480
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:10.480 --> 15:10.800
Cop.

15:10.800 --> 15:13.520
Ryan Phillipe as Frankenstein's monster.

15:13.520 --> 15:15.600
Somebody killed Ryan Phillipe, right?

15:15.600 --> 15:17.680
Then he, oh no, he's back.

15:17.680 --> 15:19.600
But he's different than he used to be.

15:19.600 --> 15:21.760
And he realizes it, I guess.

15:21.760 --> 15:22.800
Oh, who did this?

15:22.800 --> 15:23.920
Oh, it was me.

15:23.920 --> 15:26.800
Dr. Frankenstein, a real life doctor.

15:28.960 --> 15:30.160
Oh my goodness.

15:30.160 --> 15:33.280
Yeah, that's a, oh wow, that's a big pickup.

15:33.280 --> 15:34.560
Wow, holy shit.

15:34.560 --> 15:36.160
I'm going to have to say that's going back

15:36.160 --> 15:37.200
to the old woodshed.

15:37.920 --> 15:41.280
No, it's a pass because it sounds fucking awesome.

15:41.280 --> 15:42.240
And it's a pass.

15:42.240 --> 15:43.360
And they pass on that.

15:43.360 --> 15:48.160
They had that and they said, nope, this one's a pass.

15:48.160 --> 15:49.840
This one we're going to pass on.

15:49.840 --> 15:50.960
We don't deserve it.

15:50.960 --> 15:54.160
That's from the people who brought you to elementary.

15:54.160 --> 15:56.000
They wanted to go back to the well

15:56.000 --> 16:00.640
and they bring you fucking, oh, Jesus Christ.

16:00.640 --> 16:02.080
Eventually we got to start getting back

16:02.080 --> 16:03.680
to our core competencies.

16:03.680 --> 16:05.680
That is the end of the ones that I have.

16:05.680 --> 16:07.440
That is ABC and CBS.

16:08.320 --> 16:10.560
There are many more, just their dramas.

16:10.560 --> 16:13.680
There are many more networks to go over.

16:13.680 --> 16:15.760
But those are the two that I have for you right now.

16:16.800 --> 16:20.320
They're all buck, I mean, they're all so wild.

16:20.320 --> 16:22.400
Yeah, they had a show.

16:22.400 --> 16:25.120
Leslie Odom and Katie Segal as priests

16:25.120 --> 16:26.000
that are working together.

16:26.000 --> 16:26.240
Oh my God.

16:26.240 --> 16:27.120
That's a pass.

16:27.120 --> 16:28.720
What, that's a pass?

16:28.720 --> 16:29.600
That's a pass.

16:29.600 --> 16:33.520
I was hooked off that one line, off that one line.

16:33.520 --> 16:34.240
I wanted it.

16:34.240 --> 16:35.280
I know, I know.

16:35.280 --> 16:37.040
Oh, sorry, Katie Segal had a separate show.

16:37.040 --> 16:39.360
But still, that one's called Nana.

16:39.360 --> 16:40.400
That one's called Nana.

16:40.400 --> 16:42.240
That might have been the issue.

16:42.240 --> 16:44.240
That may have been the problem is it was called Nana.

16:45.680 --> 16:47.600
TV, that's it.

16:47.600 --> 16:48.480
TV sucks.

16:48.480 --> 16:49.200
I've had it with you.

16:49.760 --> 16:50.480
Hello, brothers.

16:51.040 --> 16:51.280
Hi.

16:51.280 --> 16:52.640
I work as a forklift.

16:52.640 --> 16:53.280
Hi.

16:53.280 --> 16:54.720
It's, oh, Trav, they can't.

16:54.720 --> 16:55.040
Oh.

16:55.040 --> 16:56.560
It's just a one way sort of.

16:57.440 --> 16:58.240
Hello, brothers.

16:58.240 --> 17:01.040
I work as a forklift driver in a small warehouse

17:01.040 --> 17:03.360
for a local company that sells books on the internet.

17:04.480 --> 17:05.040
Good read.

17:07.920 --> 17:11.120
Our company is big on safety and urges any employee

17:11.120 --> 17:14.240
who observes unsafe behavior to report it immediately.

17:14.240 --> 17:16.400
A few days ago, I observed one of my managers,

17:16.400 --> 17:19.040
who also happens to be our company's safety officer,

17:19.040 --> 17:22.080
hauling ass through the warehouse on a forklift

17:22.080 --> 17:25.760
and whipping around blind corners like there was no tomorrow.

17:25.760 --> 17:28.560
Was this some sort of test to see if I would report him

17:28.560 --> 17:31.040
or did I do the right thing in not being a narc?

17:31.040 --> 17:33.920
That's from the forklift in the furious in Utah.

17:33.920 --> 17:35.920
Was, I mean, did he crash?

17:35.920 --> 17:37.840
Did he crash or hit somebody?

17:37.840 --> 17:39.040
Doesn't sound like it.

17:39.040 --> 17:40.560
I mean, presumably that would have been included

17:40.560 --> 17:42.560
in the question, but you know how our listeners are.

17:42.560 --> 17:44.960
Yeah, I would have to think that if, like,

17:44.960 --> 17:46.880
and the manager killed three people,

17:46.880 --> 17:48.800
that would probably be a salient detail.

17:48.800 --> 17:50.400
And he's dead today and so am I.

17:51.360 --> 17:54.320
I just think that if he didn't crash or run into somebody,

17:54.320 --> 17:56.960
he sure did drive pretty safely, I think,

17:56.960 --> 17:58.400
and you have nothing to complain about.

17:58.400 --> 17:59.120
You know what I mean?

17:59.120 --> 17:59.440
Right.

17:59.440 --> 18:03.120
The NASCAR guys, they drive freaking fast

18:03.120 --> 18:05.920
and they spin around one big track

18:05.920 --> 18:08.800
and they bump into each other and it's cool

18:08.800 --> 18:10.960
and that's the only race that matters anymore

18:10.960 --> 18:13.360
because in horses, if you bump, it's ruined.

18:14.480 --> 18:17.040
But they are safe about it, you know what I mean?

18:17.040 --> 18:19.840
I feel like maybe he was trying to get really hands-on

18:19.840 --> 18:22.960
to say, like, in the future, I want to be able to tell people

18:22.960 --> 18:25.520
that this is unsafe with a straight face.

18:25.520 --> 18:27.520
I need to know for myself that this is unsafe.

18:27.520 --> 18:29.600
Oh, do you think someone would do it and see if I get hurt?

18:29.600 --> 18:31.680
Do you think the manager then, like, finished

18:31.680 --> 18:33.360
whatever obstacle course he had set up

18:33.360 --> 18:35.920
and was like, oh, wait, I didn't kill anybody.

18:35.920 --> 18:37.440
Maybe this is safe.

18:37.440 --> 18:38.240
This is safe.

18:38.240 --> 18:38.960
I shouldn't.

18:38.960 --> 18:39.840
This is safe.

18:39.840 --> 18:40.400
It's fine.

18:40.400 --> 18:41.280
I did it once and it's fine.

18:41.280 --> 18:43.040
I've been lying to people this whole time,

18:43.040 --> 18:45.760
telling them it wasn't safe, but look at me, I'm fine.

18:45.760 --> 18:46.160
I-

18:46.160 --> 18:48.320
Hey, guys, come over here and tear ass

18:48.320 --> 18:50.560
in these beautiful babies.

18:50.560 --> 18:51.440
I'm so sorry.

18:51.440 --> 18:53.520
Hey, if I get everybody in the break room,

18:53.520 --> 18:56.080
I need you all to go out there and tear some fucking ass

18:56.080 --> 18:58.000
in the front glass, because I was wrong this whole time.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.800
I don't think that's the verbiage of the question.

19:00.800 --> 19:02.560
Hey, J-Man.

19:02.560 --> 19:04.480
Hey, hey, Junge, is your-

19:04.480 --> 19:07.200
Didn't you say your nephew's good at painting flames?

19:07.200 --> 19:09.200
Have him come in here and put some fucking flames

19:09.200 --> 19:12.320
on these sons of bitches and let's tear some ass.

19:12.320 --> 19:14.960
And then stop bragging about your son

19:14.960 --> 19:17.440
and his skills in the workplace.

19:17.440 --> 19:18.160
Or, you know what?

19:18.160 --> 19:19.600
Put up a show up, Junge.

19:19.600 --> 19:20.400
It's time.

19:20.400 --> 19:22.800
It's time for your son, Wreck-It,

19:22.800 --> 19:24.880
to come in here and paint some flames.

19:24.880 --> 19:26.400
And then we'll all race.

19:27.440 --> 19:30.080
I just think if you don't get hurt or dead,

19:30.080 --> 19:31.520
then the thing you did was safe.

19:31.520 --> 19:34.560
I have never broken a bone in my body or been killed,

19:34.560 --> 19:37.200
and so everything I've ever done in my life,

19:37.200 --> 19:39.920
including lying to a robber at Goodpoint

19:39.920 --> 19:43.200
about GameStop's PlayStation 3 inventory,

19:43.200 --> 19:44.640
was really safe.

19:44.640 --> 19:45.360
Yep.

19:45.360 --> 19:46.640
I think it's perfectly safe.

19:46.640 --> 19:49.920
I think you always did the right thing in not narking.

19:49.920 --> 19:52.320
I would say nobody likes a nark, right?

19:53.200 --> 19:55.600
Well, I bet police do.

19:56.640 --> 19:58.000
Police probably like narks.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.040
Probably judges do.

19:59.040 --> 20:01.040
Look, I would say probably anybody

20:01.040 --> 20:05.200
in the LAPD Extended Universe likes narks.

20:05.840 --> 20:07.280
CIs, they call them.

20:07.280 --> 20:08.560
CIs!

20:08.560 --> 20:10.240
I know a little bit of the lingo going in,

20:10.240 --> 20:16.000
so I watch Courthouse and Tommy and All Rise and Nancy,

20:16.000 --> 20:17.120
so I know a lot of the lingo.

20:17.120 --> 20:19.600
All Rise sounds like the name of a show

20:19.600 --> 20:22.880
about a boy band that's also judges during the day.

20:22.880 --> 20:23.680
That's a good...

20:23.680 --> 20:25.840
See, that's a better idea for a show.

20:25.840 --> 20:28.320
That's a good name for a boy band, though, too.

20:28.320 --> 20:30.320
Yeah, All Rise for these cute guys.

20:30.320 --> 20:31.680
That's what it would say on the poster.

20:31.680 --> 20:33.120
A judge-themed...

20:33.120 --> 20:34.640
A judge-themed boy band.

20:34.640 --> 20:37.840
A judge-themed boy band with the wigs and whatnot.

20:37.840 --> 20:39.920
Yeah, they would all be in Barristers wigs

20:39.920 --> 20:40.240
and just tiny shorts.

20:40.240 --> 20:41.600
Only one of them, though, right?

20:41.600 --> 20:42.560
We gotta set them apart.

20:42.560 --> 20:44.080
So there's the Barrister wig one.

20:45.920 --> 20:47.760
There's Judge Lansito is just in it.

20:47.760 --> 20:49.680
He is one of them.

20:50.720 --> 20:53.280
I mean, there's Judge Reinhold is their manager.

20:53.280 --> 20:55.040
Yeah, he's the manager,

20:55.040 --> 20:56.960
and he's always trying to get into the group.

20:56.960 --> 20:59.520
And they're like, no, Judge, you're not a real judge.

20:59.520 --> 21:02.400
We all went to law school for many, many years.

21:02.400 --> 21:03.920
We are Judge Nelson's there,

21:03.920 --> 21:06.480
and he's like, I'm never changing my name ever.

21:06.480 --> 21:07.520
I love you boys.

21:07.520 --> 21:08.960
I'm never changing this name.

21:08.960 --> 21:11.360
I'm never adding the G, no matter how many times you ask.

21:12.160 --> 21:13.680
Come on, but we can be brothers.

21:13.680 --> 21:16.320
No, Judge, that's not how it works.

21:16.320 --> 21:19.040
What if they have a song called I'm Gonna Supremely Court You?

21:19.040 --> 21:20.720
Or what about I Wanna Hold You,

21:21.360 --> 21:23.920
parentheses, in contempt, in parentheses.

21:24.560 --> 21:25.200
That's good.

21:25.200 --> 21:25.680
Thank you.

21:25.680 --> 21:29.040
I like a sexy title where the parentheticals make it less sexy.

21:29.040 --> 21:30.240
Yeah, that's good.

21:30.240 --> 21:31.200
I love that.

21:31.200 --> 21:33.680
Objection, getting naked.

21:33.680 --> 21:35.600
This is a very sexually aggressive boy band.

21:35.600 --> 21:36.960
That's typically not their style.

21:38.960 --> 21:40.960
Their third album once they're all in their 40s

21:40.960 --> 21:41.840
and trying to get the magic back.

21:41.840 --> 21:43.920
I object to you not liking me.

21:43.920 --> 21:45.760
Oh no.

21:45.760 --> 21:47.840
That's a cool song.

21:50.160 --> 21:51.120
I have a Yahoo here.

21:53.280 --> 21:56.000
It's illegal for you to not marry me today.

21:56.000 --> 21:56.640
Wait, what?

21:56.640 --> 21:56.960
Whoa.

21:57.920 --> 21:59.520
You're just saying, I mean.

21:59.520 --> 22:00.320
That's romantic.

22:01.920 --> 22:02.720
Mike sent this in.

22:02.720 --> 22:03.120
Thanks, Mike.

22:03.120 --> 22:05.200
It's Yahoo Answers user Carlos, who asks,

22:05.920 --> 22:10.000
I missed a fight at school and I can't get them to fight again.

22:10.000 --> 22:10.560
What do I do?

22:10.560 --> 22:14.000
The one day I'm sick and had to miss school, my friend got in a fight.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.640
I tried everything to get them to fight again.

22:16.640 --> 22:19.520
I made a fake Facebook account pretending to be the guy he fought

22:19.520 --> 22:21.360
and started sending him messages talking,

22:21.920 --> 22:24.640
I'm assuming it says shit.

22:25.520 --> 22:27.280
I tried bringing up the fight every day at school,

22:27.280 --> 22:30.000
tried spreading rumors about the other person talking shit.

22:30.800 --> 22:32.880
Still, no matter what I do, they won't fight again.

22:32.880 --> 22:33.680
It's bullshit.

22:33.680 --> 22:35.760
Didn't bleep this one, Yahoo, weird,

22:35.760 --> 22:37.120
that I didn't get to see it in person.

22:37.120 --> 22:38.560
I only got to see the video.

22:39.040 --> 22:39.520
What?

22:39.520 --> 22:42.480
Wait, what a twist right there at the end.

22:44.080 --> 22:45.600
Oh, I like the book is better.

22:46.480 --> 22:48.400
I don't get to smell the blood and sweat.

22:49.840 --> 22:55.360
They missed the big fight and I only saw one fight

22:55.360 --> 22:58.640
and it was in high school and somebody had to go to the,

22:59.440 --> 23:02.560
to see the doctor who lives in the hospital

23:03.120 --> 23:04.400
because of how bad it was.

23:04.400 --> 23:07.520
And I didn't, I wouldn't say that I loved, I liked it.

23:07.520 --> 23:10.240
I wouldn't say that I would have been sad if I missed it.

23:10.240 --> 23:11.760
Or maybe it's good that I did see it

23:11.760 --> 23:14.400
because I was so viscerally horrified by the fight

23:14.400 --> 23:17.360
that I have gone out of my way to live a life

23:17.360 --> 23:19.600
that is essentially fight free.

23:19.600 --> 23:22.720
My first day of high school, the first day,

23:22.720 --> 23:26.400
I was all, oh, stars in my eyes, just so young.

23:27.280 --> 23:29.360
There was like an eight person fight

23:29.920 --> 23:32.800
that like teachers had to break up and wade into

23:32.800 --> 23:35.520
in the middle and like, it was horrifying.

23:35.520 --> 23:38.320
And it kind of feels almost like it was so dramatic

23:38.320 --> 23:41.040
that if you told me now, hey, big twist,

23:41.040 --> 23:42.960
it had been staged by the teachers

23:42.960 --> 23:45.120
as like part of a scared straight kind of thing.

23:45.840 --> 23:47.040
I would have believed you.

23:48.400 --> 23:50.800
We need to get them fighting again, though, for this one.

23:51.440 --> 23:54.800
Yeah, you gotta assign kids to a three fight deal minimum.

23:54.800 --> 23:55.440
Yes.

23:55.440 --> 23:56.640
I, you know, you want the,

23:56.640 --> 23:58.880
you want to give them the Chris Evans package.

23:58.880 --> 24:00.720
You want them to be fighting whenever

24:00.720 --> 24:03.520
and wherever you say for the next decade.

24:03.520 --> 24:06.000
Babe, you gotta lock them in early.

24:06.000 --> 24:07.920
Don't just let them go swinging

24:07.920 --> 24:09.840
because then they have all the power.

24:09.840 --> 24:12.480
Yes, also bring up to your friend,

24:12.480 --> 24:14.800
like you've been going the indirect route.

24:14.800 --> 24:17.040
I think you go directly to your friend and say,

24:17.040 --> 24:19.520
we need some kind of character arc here.

24:19.520 --> 24:23.040
Like whoever lost needs a redemption story.

24:23.040 --> 24:24.480
That's act two.

24:24.480 --> 24:27.120
And then maybe act three is like once and for all, right?

24:27.120 --> 24:30.480
Like you need, go to whoever lost and convince them

24:30.480 --> 24:33.200
that they need to have their like Rocky II, right?

24:33.200 --> 24:34.640
Where they come back and fight.

24:34.640 --> 24:37.680
And then I think convince them to work together to fight,

24:37.680 --> 24:39.440
I don't know, a Russian or something.

24:39.440 --> 24:42.000
That seems like Rocky III, if I remember correctly.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.320
I think you got to find out what both of them like

24:45.040 --> 24:48.640
and then leave a trail of each thing

24:49.680 --> 24:52.480
leading each person to one spot

24:52.480 --> 24:54.640
and then hope that the fight will kind of just happen

24:54.640 --> 24:57.360
once they are with each other.

24:57.360 --> 24:59.600
Like if your friend's into three musketeers

24:59.600 --> 25:01.520
and the other one is into like-

25:01.520 --> 25:03.840
Stocks and bonds.

25:04.640 --> 25:07.840
Or yeah, stocks and bonds, camel cigarettes.

25:07.840 --> 25:10.320
You just leave a little line of them

25:10.320 --> 25:12.240
and they'll follow it like a hungry ant.

25:12.240 --> 25:13.440
So maybe do that.

25:13.440 --> 25:16.080
Maybe like steal one of their identities

25:16.080 --> 25:18.160
and ruin their credit and blame it on the other one.

25:18.960 --> 25:19.600
Stink bomb.

25:20.240 --> 25:21.200
Or stink bomb.

25:21.200 --> 25:22.320
One of those two.

25:22.320 --> 25:23.840
I would say one of those two things

25:23.840 --> 25:24.960
would make me want to punch someone.

25:24.960 --> 25:26.080
Stealing a lunch.

25:26.080 --> 25:29.120
That would actually, I wouldn't mind.

25:29.120 --> 25:31.200
Justin, help us make these kids fight.

25:32.240 --> 25:33.280
I don't want to do that.

25:33.280 --> 25:35.520
Justin, help us make the kids fight.

25:35.520 --> 25:36.320
Play with me.

25:37.920 --> 25:41.360
I think you could wear a disguise

25:42.640 --> 25:44.320
and dress like one of the kids.

25:44.320 --> 25:46.880
See, it's fun when you start playing, isn't it?

25:47.440 --> 25:51.120
I'm having a better time now that I've said this far.

25:51.120 --> 25:55.360
I'm going to say also mustache and sunglasses

25:55.360 --> 25:57.840
and go fight the other kid and be like,

25:57.840 --> 26:02.320
I'll be waiting for my revenge over the stairs.

26:02.320 --> 26:07.280
I've made myself sad because I thought about an actual,

26:07.280 --> 26:09.840
I don't know, helpful answer for Yahoo.

26:09.840 --> 26:11.280
And I'm worried about that.

26:11.280 --> 26:14.960
I don't like it, but you could just start saying,

26:14.960 --> 26:17.280
I heard blank and blank.

26:17.280 --> 26:19.360
We're going to fight after school today

26:19.360 --> 26:21.520
and just spread that rumor around

26:21.520 --> 26:23.200
until they can't not fight.

26:23.200 --> 26:25.280
Now that's some rough playing, Trav.

26:25.280 --> 26:26.960
I know I wanted you to play with me,

26:26.960 --> 26:28.160
but you're rough, house and a little rough.

26:28.160 --> 26:29.200
I know that's what I'm saying.

26:30.720 --> 26:32.320
We do jokes here, Trav.

26:32.320 --> 26:36.560
I don't know how I feel about being an effective fixer

26:36.560 --> 26:39.200
for this horrible Yahoo answers person.

26:39.200 --> 26:41.360
You do the thing where you stand in between the two of them,

26:41.360 --> 26:43.520
which is going to be some tricky planning

26:43.520 --> 26:44.560
to get that to happen.

26:44.560 --> 26:47.600
And then you say to one of them like,

26:47.600 --> 26:49.680
hey, yo mama's feet sink, and when they go to punch you

26:49.680 --> 26:51.360
in the face, you duck, and they punch the other one.

26:51.360 --> 26:53.440
And then they will keep doing that.

26:53.440 --> 26:56.800
This ties in really well with the next regular question.

26:56.800 --> 26:58.160
You could do it, I'm not done.

26:58.160 --> 27:00.400
You could do a thing where you run up behind one of them

27:00.400 --> 27:02.320
and you stick your arms through their armpits

27:02.320 --> 27:04.480
and you punch the other person like they're a muppet

27:04.480 --> 27:07.280
and then they'll think it's their arms.

27:07.280 --> 27:09.920
What about when the kid opens his locker,

27:11.200 --> 27:14.320
a bunch of fucking marbles fall out?

27:14.320 --> 27:16.240
Because you've been slowly putting marbles

27:16.240 --> 27:17.600
in there every day.

27:17.600 --> 27:20.960
And behind all the marbles, there's a sign that says,

27:20.960 --> 27:22.480
this one was Kevin.

27:22.480 --> 27:24.000
And then, yeah.

27:24.000 --> 27:25.360
And a picture of Kevin Kline.

27:26.560 --> 27:28.880
So, no, I wouldn't think that.

27:28.880 --> 27:30.240
I was thinking that maybe the kid,

27:30.240 --> 27:32.240
he's trying to get into a fight with his name Kevin,

27:32.240 --> 27:36.800
not beloved actor on stage and scream Kevin Kline.

27:36.800 --> 27:38.640
Maybe the kid is Kevin Kline.

27:38.640 --> 27:39.520
I had a friend named Kevin Kline.

27:39.520 --> 27:43.200
Maybe Kevin Kline went back to like 23 Jump Street

27:43.200 --> 27:43.760
and Kevin Kline's back.

27:43.760 --> 27:45.440
There's more than one Kevin Kline, Justin.

27:45.440 --> 27:47.040
There was a Kevin Kline in my middle school.

27:47.920 --> 27:48.560
Was there really?

27:48.560 --> 27:49.040
Yeah.

27:49.040 --> 27:51.280
And as far as I know, it's not the same person.

27:52.240 --> 27:53.040
That's cool.

27:53.040 --> 27:53.600
That's really cool.

27:53.600 --> 27:54.640
It was cool.

27:54.640 --> 27:56.080
That's badass, dude.

27:56.080 --> 27:59.200
You've said so much fucking trash over the years, Travis,

27:59.200 --> 28:00.960
and you never said the words,

28:00.960 --> 28:03.440
I went to school with a kid named Kevin Kline.

28:03.440 --> 28:05.200
And you said so much other garbage

28:05.200 --> 28:06.320
where you could have been saying that.

28:06.320 --> 28:09.120
Travis, that's the coolest thing you've ever said.

28:09.120 --> 28:11.520
I know, it just wasn't Jermaine before now

28:11.520 --> 28:12.560
and I didn't want to burn it.

28:12.560 --> 28:13.200
I had one chance.

28:13.200 --> 28:15.680
Don't tell me you went to school with a kid named Jermaine, too.

28:15.680 --> 28:16.640
Now I'm freaking out.

28:16.640 --> 28:17.840
Holy shit.

28:17.840 --> 28:19.120
Was it spelled the same?

28:19.120 --> 28:20.800
Or was it Kevin with a C?

28:20.800 --> 28:21.360
Exactly the same.

28:21.360 --> 28:22.160
Fuck yeah, dude.

28:23.520 --> 28:24.240
That kicks ass.

28:24.240 --> 28:25.360
That's so cool, Travis.

28:25.360 --> 28:27.120
Yeah, it was cool.

28:27.120 --> 28:29.760
Did he act or do any other cool shit like that?

28:29.760 --> 28:31.920
He saw a goldfish or what's up?

28:31.920 --> 28:34.480
You know, I just remember him living his best life

28:34.480 --> 28:36.160
and being a good example.

28:36.160 --> 28:37.200
Cool, man.

28:37.200 --> 28:38.800
Yeah, dude, for sure.

28:38.800 --> 28:40.080
For sure, for sure, for sure.

28:40.080 --> 28:40.960
Don't make the kids fight.

28:40.960 --> 28:41.840
Kids shouldn't fight.

28:41.840 --> 28:42.320
Okay.

28:42.320 --> 28:44.000
And with that, we'll go to the Money Zone.

28:55.120 --> 28:58.720
Hey, it can be hard to find the exact right person

28:58.720 --> 29:03.200
for your business and that's a confusing path to walk

29:03.760 --> 29:08.320
with lots of dead ends and people along the way.

29:08.320 --> 29:11.440
They'll try to sell you watches from a coat,

29:11.440 --> 29:13.280
but you don't need to stop with them

29:13.280 --> 29:16.960
or any other of the illusions that try to lure you

29:16.960 --> 29:18.320
into danger or anything.

29:18.320 --> 29:21.280
Uh-oh, here comes a, now there's a big spider

29:21.280 --> 29:24.640
and he's standing before a branch in the forest path

29:24.640 --> 29:25.760
and he can talk.

29:26.560 --> 29:27.600
If you go down that path,

29:27.600 --> 29:29.840
they're gonna confront your shadow self

29:29.840 --> 29:31.040
and you'll have to destroy it.

29:31.040 --> 29:31.600
Go right.

29:32.720 --> 29:36.480
Go right and you'll find a guide hunched under a waterfall

29:36.480 --> 29:38.080
and that guide is Zip Recruiter.

29:38.080 --> 29:41.680
It's me, Zip Recruiter.

29:41.680 --> 29:43.840
Hey Zip, I heard that you send my job

29:43.840 --> 29:46.320
to over a hundred of the web's leading job boards.

29:46.320 --> 29:47.040
That's true.

29:47.040 --> 29:48.160
Do you stop there?

29:48.160 --> 29:49.520
I don't stop there.

29:49.520 --> 29:52.240
I have powerful matching technology.

29:52.240 --> 29:56.560
Me, Zip Recruiter, scans thousands of resumes.

29:57.440 --> 29:58.080
Oh no.

29:58.080 --> 29:58.480
Oh shit.

29:58.480 --> 29:59.760
It's me, Gobblegum.

29:59.760 --> 30:01.760
I eat resumes.

30:01.760 --> 30:03.360
I'll kill you, Gobblegum.

30:03.360 --> 30:05.840
I said if you ever showed your goddamn face around here,

30:05.840 --> 30:08.080
I'd kill you.

30:08.080 --> 30:08.720
No.

30:08.720 --> 30:10.160
Fuck you, Gobblegum.

30:10.160 --> 30:13.040
The crystalline sword, it's emerging from your chest,

30:13.040 --> 30:14.320
Zip Recruiter.

30:14.320 --> 30:17.280
I'm taking the sword, I'm stabbing Gobblegum.

30:17.280 --> 30:18.160
My jellies.

30:18.880 --> 30:19.920
He's dying.

30:19.920 --> 30:22.160
Thank you, Zip Recruiter, for your chest sword.

30:22.160 --> 30:23.520
Yes, I am unstoppable.

30:23.520 --> 30:26.960
In fact, I'm so effective that four out of five employers

30:26.960 --> 30:30.080
who post on Zip Recruiter get a quality candidate

30:30.080 --> 30:32.400
through the site within the first day.

30:32.400 --> 30:33.440
I'm not yet gone.

30:34.240 --> 30:34.800
Gobblegum.

30:34.800 --> 30:35.600
Thank you.

30:35.600 --> 30:37.200
Justin, give me just one second.

30:37.200 --> 30:38.800
I've got to go murder this fool.

30:38.800 --> 30:42.640
Wait, ZipRecruiter.com slash my brother.

30:43.280 --> 30:45.360
Gobblegum, Gobblegum.

30:45.360 --> 30:47.200
I see he says his own name like a Pokemon.

30:47.920 --> 30:50.480
How can people harness these incredible services, Zip?

30:50.480 --> 30:52.640
I already said the link really good as Gobblegum.

30:52.640 --> 30:54.640
Yeah, but it didn't make any narrative sense

30:54.640 --> 30:55.840
for you to fucking say that.

30:55.840 --> 30:59.360
Hey, ZipRecruiter.com slash my brother.

30:59.360 --> 31:02.800
That's ZipRecruiter.com slash my brother.

31:02.800 --> 31:06.240
Zip Recruiter, I'm the smartest way to hire.

31:07.600 --> 31:09.440
Hey, guys, it's me, Postmates.

31:10.720 --> 31:13.680
Do you need some food or whatever delivered?

31:14.560 --> 31:15.920
Call up me, Postmates.

31:18.880 --> 31:21.040
You guys should, now you guys do one of them.

31:21.040 --> 31:21.920
Sucks ass.

31:21.920 --> 31:22.880
Yours sucks.

31:22.880 --> 31:23.760
Ours was so cool.

31:23.760 --> 31:25.760
Yeah, ours had a rich fiction behind it.

31:28.080 --> 31:29.520
I've gone beast form.

31:30.400 --> 31:32.080
Postmates has a beast form?

31:32.080 --> 31:34.400
Postmates has an engaged beast form.

31:35.120 --> 31:35.600
Activate.

31:40.240 --> 31:42.800
Postmates is a bunch of people that can turn into moped.

31:45.040 --> 31:46.320
Armed bazookas.

31:46.320 --> 31:47.680
And they have armed bazookas.

31:47.680 --> 31:51.040
Those armed bazookas can shoot red wine to you or sushi

31:51.040 --> 31:52.800
or I don't know, ibuprofen

31:52.800 --> 31:55.040
because you ate too much red wine and sushi.

31:55.040 --> 31:55.840
Hey, guys, it's me.

31:55.840 --> 31:57.360
I'm regular Postmates again

31:57.360 --> 31:59.920
and I do personal food delivery, grocery,

31:59.920 --> 32:02.000
whatever the fuck you want delivered.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.560
I can get it there to you 24-7.

32:04.560 --> 32:05.920
You don't have to take any more trips.

32:07.040 --> 32:08.560
Hold on, my beast gym is glowing.

32:08.560 --> 32:09.520
Can one of you guys finish?

32:10.880 --> 32:11.380
No.

32:12.480 --> 32:13.920
Beastmates.

32:13.920 --> 32:15.600
You don't have to take trips to the store.

32:15.600 --> 32:16.960
You can download the app for iOS.

32:16.960 --> 32:19.600
Download the app from Beastmates.

32:19.600 --> 32:21.600
Or Android for free.

32:21.600 --> 32:23.520
Browse local restaurants and businesses

32:23.520 --> 32:24.640
and track your delivery.

32:25.200 --> 32:27.840
I can track it with my powerful wolf nose.

32:28.880 --> 32:30.880
They're the largest on demand network

32:30.880 --> 32:34.880
in the known universe with more than 25,000 partner merchants.

32:36.240 --> 32:37.520
So for a limited time,

32:37.520 --> 32:40.480
I'm giving our listeners $100 of free delivery credit

32:40.480 --> 32:41.920
for your first seven days.

32:41.920 --> 32:43.280
To start your free deliveries,

32:43.280 --> 32:45.120
download the app and use the code MYBROTHER.

32:45.120 --> 32:46.800
That's MYBROTHER, all one word,

32:46.800 --> 32:50.320
for $100 of free delivery credit for your first seven days

32:50.320 --> 32:51.280
when you, bing, bing.

32:51.280 --> 32:53.840
How come I'm so clean?

32:53.840 --> 32:55.680
When you download the Postmates app.

32:55.680 --> 32:58.400
Anything you need, anytime you need it, Postmate it.

32:58.400 --> 33:02.080
Download Postmates and save with code MYBROTHER all one way.

33:03.680 --> 33:06.720
You know, a lot of shows brag about being ad-free,

33:06.720 --> 33:10.400
but not a lot are willing to put in the work it takes to get there

33:10.400 --> 33:12.560
to really make that an absolute reality.

33:12.560 --> 33:16.640
We're working hard every episode to drive advertisers away.

33:16.640 --> 33:18.880
This is the only way we know to go ad-free

33:18.880 --> 33:21.920
and that's to systematically alienate everybody

33:21.920 --> 33:23.360
who would want to give us money.

33:23.360 --> 33:24.560
But do go.

33:24.560 --> 33:28.400
Those sponsors, we have gotten so nasty

33:28.400 --> 33:30.480
with everybody who gives us money

33:30.480 --> 33:31.840
and nobody ever gives a shit,

33:31.840 --> 33:33.920
so please frequent their businesses

33:33.920 --> 33:37.120
because they keep letting us do it.

33:37.120 --> 33:39.200
Nobody's ever told us to stop doing it.

33:39.200 --> 33:40.160
I don't know.

33:40.160 --> 33:43.200
Maybe eventually somebody will get wise, but...

33:43.200 --> 33:46.400
Just Beastmates flipped my chair and I lost all my settings.

33:46.400 --> 33:53.680
To give you those again, ZipRecruiter.com slash MYBROTHER

33:53.680 --> 33:58.320
and Postmates is the app and then use the code MYBROTHER to save.

33:58.320 --> 34:00.640
If you could just do that this week.

34:00.640 --> 34:03.040
And don't mention, please don't mention these ads.

34:03.040 --> 34:04.000
That'd be great.

34:04.000 --> 34:07.280
No, do mention, I mean say these are effective ads.

34:07.280 --> 34:09.200
This is the future of advertising.

34:09.200 --> 34:12.320
I mean, I don't know if it's a good thing or a bad thing,

34:12.320 --> 34:16.400
but these are effective ads, this is the future of advertising.

34:16.400 --> 34:17.920
This is how it should be.

34:17.920 --> 34:18.640
Hey, James.

34:18.640 --> 34:19.520
Hey, Nakay.

34:19.520 --> 34:20.400
What we doing, girl?

34:20.400 --> 34:22.480
We are inviting the awesome listeners of Maximum Fun

34:22.480 --> 34:24.080
to join us at Minority Corner.

34:24.080 --> 34:25.200
Ooh, fun.

34:25.200 --> 34:27.680
But you know how we go on Tangent City.

34:27.680 --> 34:28.880
We're the joint mayors.

34:28.880 --> 34:30.080
We're not gonna do that, okay?

34:30.080 --> 34:30.960
Supes focus.

34:30.960 --> 34:33.600
Okay, so Minority Corner is where you can all come

34:33.600 --> 34:35.120
and get your pop culture takes.

34:35.120 --> 34:38.160
Plus social commentary, news, and TV movie reactions

34:38.160 --> 34:39.440
like Avengers Endgame.

34:39.440 --> 34:40.560
No spoilers here.

34:40.560 --> 34:41.440
Ooh, snap.

34:41.440 --> 34:42.880
Sometimes we dig into the vaults

34:42.880 --> 34:45.200
and we review and recap those movies you missed.

34:45.200 --> 34:46.800
Good at you, Halle Berry's kidnapped.

34:46.800 --> 34:48.400
I love how she always gives 1000%.

34:48.960 --> 34:49.680
Like Beyonce.

34:49.680 --> 34:51.280
Did you see Homecoming on Netflix?

34:51.280 --> 34:53.200
She was burning it down like the Mother of Dragons.

34:53.200 --> 34:54.560
Have you seen the latest Game of Thrones?

34:54.560 --> 34:55.200
So good.

34:55.200 --> 34:56.320
Only thing missing?

34:56.320 --> 34:57.760
More black people.

34:57.760 --> 34:59.040
What you think about Mayor Pete?

34:59.040 --> 35:00.000
Wait a minute, James.

35:00.000 --> 35:00.960
We went on a tangent?

35:00.960 --> 35:01.520
Yes.

35:01.520 --> 35:02.160
I will.

35:02.160 --> 35:04.480
Join us every Friday for more tangents.

35:04.480 --> 35:05.440
On Maximum Fun.

35:06.640 --> 35:08.480
I was recently invited to a birthday party

35:08.480 --> 35:09.680
for a good friend of mine.

35:09.680 --> 35:11.520
On the invitation, there was a little note that said,

35:11.520 --> 35:13.200
your presence is our present.

35:13.200 --> 35:15.120
While this normally wouldn't be an issue

35:15.120 --> 35:17.440
as it takes away the burden of wondering what to get them,

35:17.440 --> 35:20.000
this particular person's invite poses a problem.

35:20.560 --> 35:22.080
The last time I went to a party of theirs,

35:22.080 --> 35:22.880
a Christmas party,

35:23.440 --> 35:27.280
where they put your presence is our present on the invite,

35:27.280 --> 35:29.840
literally everyone but me brought a Christmas gift

35:29.840 --> 35:30.400
to the host.

35:31.040 --> 35:31.600
What do I do?

35:32.320 --> 35:34.880
Should I ignore the note and buy them a gift they might like?

35:34.880 --> 35:37.360
Or should I abide by the note and risk being the only person

35:37.360 --> 35:40.240
to show up empty-handed and look like a total jackass?

35:40.240 --> 35:42.160
Any advice at all would be appreciated.

35:42.160 --> 35:43.360
That's from Puzzled Party Goer.

35:43.360 --> 35:43.760
Get a gift.

35:43.760 --> 35:44.480
People like presents.

35:45.040 --> 35:46.880
Next question.

35:46.880 --> 35:48.960
I work at an office in downtown Manhattan

35:48.960 --> 35:51.440
that's situated between several populous tourist attractions.

35:51.440 --> 35:52.080
Wow, wow, wow.

35:52.080 --> 35:53.040
I said populous.

35:53.040 --> 35:53.280
Yeah.

35:54.080 --> 35:54.560
They are-

35:54.560 --> 35:57.680
I think you also said Dantown, Manhattan.

35:57.680 --> 35:59.680
And that's why we call it Dantown.

36:00.240 --> 36:02.880
New on CBS, it's Dantown.

36:02.880 --> 36:06.000
Downtown Julie Brown is back in Murphy Brown's Dantown.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.480
I work at an office in downtown Manhattan

36:08.480 --> 36:11.920
that is situated between several popular tourist attractions.

36:11.920 --> 36:14.000
The Stock Exchange, World Trade Center,

36:14.000 --> 36:15.360
Federal Hall, et cetera.

36:16.160 --> 36:17.600
Whenever I leave my office for lunch,

36:17.600 --> 36:21.120
the area is flooded with tourists taking photos.

36:21.120 --> 36:23.200
I feel really guilty when I walk in front of a camera

36:23.200 --> 36:24.880
and inadvertently ruin a picture,

36:24.880 --> 36:27.760
but it is virtually impossible to avoid doing so.

36:27.760 --> 36:31.040
How can I ensure that I don't ruin the photo of a nice family

36:31.040 --> 36:34.000
visiting the big city while simply trying to eat my burrito?

36:34.000 --> 36:37.040
Is there a way that my unintentional photobombing

36:37.040 --> 36:38.880
could improve their vacation?

36:38.880 --> 36:40.080
And that's from Brian.

36:40.080 --> 36:42.400
And I will quickly dispel Brian of the last one,

36:42.400 --> 36:43.840
and that is to say no.

36:43.840 --> 36:45.440
That will not improve anything.

36:45.440 --> 36:48.480
What if Brian walks around dressed as Iron Man?

36:49.280 --> 36:51.280
Travis, I was literally gonna say Iron Man.

36:51.280 --> 36:53.840
Iron Man was even the one I was gonna say, dude.

36:53.840 --> 36:54.480
Yeah, dude.

36:55.040 --> 36:55.600
Fuck yeah.

36:56.720 --> 36:58.400
Yeah, and it doesn't even need to be

36:58.400 --> 37:00.880
an especially good Iron Man costume.

37:00.880 --> 37:02.800
No, I think if it's a little blurry,

37:02.800 --> 37:04.800
maybe the costume's blurry, you know?

37:04.800 --> 37:06.640
It's like, oh, he's moving so fast.

37:06.640 --> 37:09.760
Iron Man, Pikachu, so many of these folks

37:09.760 --> 37:11.920
that people would love to see in their pictures

37:11.920 --> 37:13.680
because it's fun to have a picture with them.

37:15.120 --> 37:17.040
That's one really good way.

37:17.040 --> 37:19.680
I mean, just have a nice smile always

37:19.680 --> 37:21.360
when you're walking to get your lunch,

37:21.360 --> 37:24.080
which you should be happy anyway because it's burrito time.

37:24.080 --> 37:26.800
I would say whenever I take a picture in a busy area,

37:26.800 --> 37:30.720
my greatest fear in all my life in that moment

37:30.720 --> 37:33.360
is that I am impeding someone's progress

37:33.360 --> 37:35.040
as they try to walk to their location.

37:35.040 --> 37:38.480
So I think I'd prefer the person just truck on through.

37:38.480 --> 37:39.920
I'll snap another pic.

37:39.920 --> 37:40.960
Don't linger.

37:40.960 --> 37:42.480
I have two children under five

37:42.480 --> 37:44.320
that I'm trying to simultaneously get to look

37:44.320 --> 37:46.000
at the little glass circle on my phone.

37:46.720 --> 37:49.280
So statistically speaking, you're not ruining anything.

37:49.280 --> 37:51.520
I'm going to delete this picture, no question.

37:51.520 --> 37:53.920
I'm gonna take 30 of them and there's no way.

37:53.920 --> 37:56.480
Oh, you're doing so much better than I am.

37:56.480 --> 37:59.840
If I beef it, I want a pristine camera roll in there, baby.

37:59.840 --> 38:01.920
I want them to tuck in to a real,

38:01.920 --> 38:04.720
I want them to say Justin had a hidden knack

38:04.720 --> 38:07.040
for being a great, great photographer

38:07.040 --> 38:09.600
and we never knew and we never appreciated

38:09.600 --> 38:12.560
like so many other great things about him.

38:12.560 --> 38:15.440
We did not appreciate this fully while he was with us.

38:15.440 --> 38:16.720
I miss him so bad.

38:16.720 --> 38:18.800
What's that noise from up in the rafters?

38:18.800 --> 38:20.080
Ceiling crashes down.

38:20.080 --> 38:20.640
It's me?

38:20.640 --> 38:21.120
What?

38:21.120 --> 38:22.400
I faked my death.

38:22.400 --> 38:22.800
I did.

38:22.800 --> 38:26.480
Now you are really dead because you fell from the rafters.

38:26.480 --> 38:28.560
I am actually dead this time.

38:28.560 --> 38:30.480
No faking, I wake up.

38:30.480 --> 38:32.000
It was all a dream?

38:32.000 --> 38:35.360
You crashed through the rafters of your own bedroom ceiling.

38:36.080 --> 38:36.400
What?

38:37.040 --> 38:37.520
Yes.

38:37.520 --> 38:37.840
What?

38:38.480 --> 38:40.160
I think it's all about making stories.

38:40.160 --> 38:42.000
That's why people take photos is for stories.

38:42.000 --> 38:44.960
So if you can do something to accentuate the story

38:44.960 --> 38:46.320
of their New York adventure,

38:47.120 --> 38:49.760
like do cartwheels the whole way to the burrito

38:49.760 --> 38:52.000
and they'll be like, remember the cartwheels guy?

38:52.000 --> 38:55.360
Let me pitch this a little less physically demanding.

38:55.360 --> 38:57.920
As you walk by, put your phone to your ear and say,

38:57.920 --> 38:59.120
what's that, Mr. Mayor?

38:59.120 --> 39:00.480
The asteroid's on its way.

39:00.480 --> 39:03.040
I'll be right there as you walk by.

39:03.040 --> 39:05.600
And then they're like, whoa, wait, what just happened?

39:05.600 --> 39:08.880
Is that person some sort of superhero or scientist

39:08.880 --> 39:11.920
or a super scientist or super Saiyan?

39:11.920 --> 39:13.440
And you just keep walking.

39:13.440 --> 39:14.400
Travis makes a good point.

39:14.400 --> 39:16.240
Goku is another character you could just up as.

39:16.240 --> 39:17.200
So that one would be easy.

39:18.320 --> 39:20.400
You could, this would be a fun story.

39:20.400 --> 39:22.400
Remember that time we were taking a picture

39:22.400 --> 39:24.160
in front of the stock exchange

39:24.160 --> 39:26.880
and a person walked by us and just crop dusted

39:26.880 --> 39:28.240
the heck out of us as they went,

39:28.960 --> 39:31.760
just ripped a big fart and they kept going.

39:32.320 --> 39:34.720
And you could do that to all of them.

39:34.720 --> 39:36.960
You just have to really open up down there.

39:36.960 --> 39:39.360
Open up all the vents.

39:39.360 --> 39:41.760
Yeah, and then blast off.

39:44.320 --> 39:44.960
Cause I'll tell you,

39:44.960 --> 39:46.720
you're not gonna have much trouble coming back

39:46.720 --> 39:48.960
after you eat one of these Chipotle burritos.

39:48.960 --> 39:49.680
I'll tell you what,

39:52.240 --> 39:53.440
when I eat one of those,

39:53.440 --> 39:57.360
it gives me a lot of stomach distress.

39:57.360 --> 39:59.200
So I assume it's the same for you.

39:59.200 --> 39:59.920
Yeah, keep going.

39:59.920 --> 40:01.680
Hey, do you remember when we went to New York

40:01.680 --> 40:03.440
and Iron Man farted on us?

40:07.840 --> 40:13.280
We were in downtown Manhattan and Iron Man farted

40:13.280 --> 40:15.840
on me and our children and grandma.

40:17.440 --> 40:18.160
Y'all want a yahoo?

40:18.160 --> 40:18.720
How about another question?

40:18.720 --> 40:19.360
How about a yahoo?

40:19.360 --> 40:20.960
Oh damn, I was about to ask you for that.

40:20.960 --> 40:22.480
That's what I meant, a yahoo question.

40:22.480 --> 40:23.920
Do you all want a yahoo?

40:23.920 --> 40:24.560
No.

40:24.560 --> 40:25.120
Yes, please.

40:25.120 --> 40:26.720
Here's one that was sent in by Esther.

40:26.720 --> 40:27.280
Thanks, Esther.

40:27.280 --> 40:28.880
It's from an anonymous yahoo answers user

40:28.880 --> 40:31.280
who I'm gonna call Bubby.

40:31.280 --> 40:35.440
Asks, did soldiers in the American Revolution

40:35.440 --> 40:39.920
ever take off their shirts slash coats off during battles?

40:39.920 --> 40:41.600
They must have gotten all sweaty and hot

40:41.600 --> 40:43.680
fighting in the heat all day in those heavy garments.

40:44.560 --> 40:49.440
They must have gotten all hot and sweaty and dirty stink.

40:49.440 --> 40:51.360
Get the stink of the arms and the butt

40:51.360 --> 40:55.440
and the grundle from the hot fighting in the heat all day

40:55.440 --> 40:57.840
in those heavy garments, especially the red coats.

40:57.840 --> 40:58.960
Or was it against the rules?

40:59.600 --> 41:04.800
This fall on CBS, Red Coats, No Coats starring...

41:04.800 --> 41:05.600
What is the question?

41:05.600 --> 41:07.600
These boys have done war so much

41:07.600 --> 41:09.760
that they have a right powerful stink

41:09.760 --> 41:12.560
in between their legs and under their arms.

41:12.560 --> 41:14.560
I'm gonna say, let's see who's in this.

41:14.560 --> 41:16.000
Joshua Jackson's in it.

41:16.640 --> 41:18.160
Josh Jackson's in it.

41:18.160 --> 41:19.680
Christopher Jackson's in it.

41:20.240 --> 41:21.280
Josh Molina's in it.

41:21.280 --> 41:23.840
Did they ever take off their shirts and coats

41:23.840 --> 41:25.840
during the battles in the American Revolution?

41:26.480 --> 41:27.680
They couldn't figure out how to.

41:28.800 --> 41:30.320
There's a lot of buttons, I'll give you that.

41:31.360 --> 41:32.880
That's how every, if you've ever,

41:32.880 --> 41:33.680
I know it's a different war,

41:33.680 --> 41:35.760
but if you've ever seen Civil War reactors,

41:35.760 --> 41:39.200
the last thing they do at every one

41:39.200 --> 41:41.520
is like the general or whatever is like,

41:41.520 --> 41:45.680
and now men, let's all shower together.

41:45.680 --> 41:49.600
And then they all go, they all go shower together

41:49.600 --> 41:52.000
in frolic nude in a river.

41:52.000 --> 41:53.520
That's why kids can't go to those things.

41:54.320 --> 41:56.960
Can you imagine, man?

41:56.960 --> 41:58.000
I'm imagining it now.

41:59.840 --> 42:00.560
It's pretty good.

42:01.920 --> 42:04.160
The worst part of being in war

42:04.160 --> 42:06.720
has gotta be the fact that you can't take your clothes off

42:07.440 --> 42:13.040
even when you get a gunky stink down any witch wear.

42:13.040 --> 42:15.040
And I don't know why.

42:15.040 --> 42:17.120
Well, because it's dangerous.

42:17.120 --> 42:18.560
It's not like it's armor, Griffin.

42:18.560 --> 42:22.400
In fact, you would never hear in the Revolutionary War like,

42:22.400 --> 42:24.000
oh, he would have died if it weren't

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
for that thin layer of material.

42:26.000 --> 42:28.160
They don't know if you're a blue one or a red one.

42:28.160 --> 42:28.640
Yes, exactly.

42:28.640 --> 42:29.360
You don't know the teams.

42:29.360 --> 42:32.320
What if you, imagine you're American Revolutionary,

42:32.320 --> 42:34.400
you get called by a bunch of Brits, right?

42:34.400 --> 42:36.400
All you gotta do is strip off your shirt

42:36.400 --> 42:38.080
and be like, go and blow me dents,

42:38.080 --> 42:39.920
don't you miss the team's biscuits?

42:39.920 --> 42:42.160
And then they'd shoot you because it was a bad accident.

42:42.160 --> 42:44.960
But still, the idea, you understand, of course.

42:44.960 --> 42:47.040
You have a Harley Davidson tattoo,

42:47.040 --> 42:48.720
so they know and they kill you right there.

42:48.720 --> 42:49.200
Yeah.

42:49.200 --> 42:50.480
What I'm saying is you get a-

42:50.480 --> 42:51.520
From the future?

42:51.520 --> 42:51.840
Yes.

42:52.640 --> 42:55.120
I want to do one more question, Justin.

42:55.120 --> 42:57.200
I've got just the one for you.

42:57.200 --> 42:57.840
It's the next one.

42:57.840 --> 42:58.480
Okay.

42:58.480 --> 43:00.400
My housemate's dad is going to be crashing

43:00.400 --> 43:01.440
at our house for a few days.

43:01.440 --> 43:02.720
Oh, fuck yeah, Philip?

43:03.280 --> 43:04.400
Philip's coming?

43:04.400 --> 43:05.200
That dude rules.

43:05.200 --> 43:07.840
Philip's dad is coming.

43:08.400 --> 43:09.680
A housemate's dad is going to be crashing

43:09.680 --> 43:12.320
at our house for a few days while my housemate is in Mexico.

43:12.320 --> 43:14.880
He's visited a couple of times, so we know him okay.

43:14.880 --> 43:17.200
Here's the thing, this man has recently gotten into

43:17.200 --> 43:19.280
making DIY music videos for himself.

43:20.800 --> 43:23.200
That's the new sound I make when I get so excited

43:23.200 --> 43:24.320
that I can jump up and-

43:24.320 --> 43:26.000
And asks us to give feedback.

43:26.000 --> 43:28.080
Literally had us sit down at the house,

43:28.080 --> 43:29.440
watch the music video with him,

43:29.440 --> 43:32.480
and ask us to go around and be honest about what we thought.

43:32.480 --> 43:34.640
Thankfully, the music video wasn't terrible.

43:34.640 --> 43:36.560
Nice, but it's clearly DIY.

43:36.560 --> 43:38.240
Mostly shots of his face at different angles

43:38.240 --> 43:40.320
wearing sunglasses as he sings somebody's guitar.

43:40.320 --> 43:47.360
I don't know how you make what you just described not terrible,

43:47.360 --> 43:49.840
but I want to see it so bad.

43:49.840 --> 43:51.200
It's been about six months,

43:51.200 --> 43:52.720
so there's a chance he'll do it again.

43:52.720 --> 43:54.720
He's been working on a full-length album.

43:54.720 --> 43:57.520
And we won't have his daughter there as a buffer

43:57.520 --> 44:00.800
to gauge how much honest feedback to give this man.

44:00.800 --> 44:02.800
Brothers, what would you do if your friend's dad,

44:02.800 --> 44:04.320
who you didn't know super well,

44:04.320 --> 44:06.240
asked for feedback on his music video?

44:06.240 --> 44:08.720
That's from Nervous About Notes in Seattle.

44:08.720 --> 44:10.960
There are so many fucking things.

44:12.800 --> 44:14.480
Here's the wildest part.

44:16.800 --> 44:18.400
It's the truth for you to know.

44:18.400 --> 44:20.560
The dad is just coming for this.

44:20.560 --> 44:23.040
Because his daughter, she ain't there.

44:23.600 --> 44:26.000
He's not visiting his little schnookums.

44:26.000 --> 44:28.960
He's there to see if he's giving too much guitar face

44:28.960 --> 44:30.720
and if he needs to turn up the trip.

44:32.480 --> 44:35.600
To answer your question of what we would do in this situation,

44:36.800 --> 44:38.080
and I know this is kind of a cop-out,

44:38.080 --> 44:41.200
I wouldn't allow myself to get into a situation like this.

44:41.200 --> 44:42.880
If I found out one of my friend's dads

44:42.880 --> 44:46.320
makes amateur music videos and has any desire

44:46.320 --> 44:48.720
for human feedback, I would have to just break up

44:48.720 --> 44:52.000
with that friend immediately, publicly on Facebook,

44:52.000 --> 44:54.720
just to avoid the exact situation you're in right now.

44:54.720 --> 44:56.560
But I appreciate that you're in it.

44:56.560 --> 44:58.240
I like that very much.

44:58.240 --> 45:02.560
I actually think I might be excited

45:02.560 --> 45:04.480
to be a part of this situation.

45:04.480 --> 45:07.440
Because you said it wasn't bad, maybe this one's better.

45:07.440 --> 45:09.520
Maybe the next one's gonna be even better.

45:09.520 --> 45:11.840
And what if he integrated some of your feedback

45:11.840 --> 45:13.040
from last time?

45:13.040 --> 45:15.600
He's like, remember when you said my shirt was too short

45:15.600 --> 45:17.440
and that it should cover all my torso?

45:17.440 --> 45:20.640
Well, good news, this one's down on my knees, let's go.

45:20.640 --> 45:23.360
Remember when you said I should include more claymation?

45:23.360 --> 45:26.960
Well, I had my friend Peter Gabriel help me

45:26.960 --> 45:29.200
and it gets pretty weird.

45:29.200 --> 45:31.920
I put a second mortgage on the house to put more in there.

45:31.920 --> 45:34.800
And also, yeah, I am wearing my jeans backwards.

45:34.800 --> 45:36.880
That's a new thing.

45:36.880 --> 45:38.400
I got this new thing in this video

45:38.400 --> 45:40.480
and it's where I make out with my wife

45:40.480 --> 45:41.680
on a big beanbag chair.

45:42.400 --> 45:44.400
And we do that for like one of the choruses.

45:44.400 --> 45:46.000
So tell me what you think of that.

45:46.000 --> 45:46.960
What do you think about that?

45:48.240 --> 45:49.520
It's deep kissing.

45:49.520 --> 45:50.880
Yeah, it's all real, folks.

45:51.840 --> 45:52.400
That's all new.

45:52.400 --> 45:53.520
I'm still playing the guitar too.

45:53.520 --> 45:55.840
I'm still rocking my ax too, while I'm tongue deep.

45:57.600 --> 46:00.080
And then there's a scene where I'm just throwing a couch

46:00.080 --> 46:01.520
off of a cliff.

46:01.520 --> 46:03.360
It's weird, it's a little avant garde.

46:03.920 --> 46:05.200
Let me know what you think.

46:05.200 --> 46:06.880
There's a scene where I put a bunch of rubber bands

46:06.880 --> 46:08.560
around a watermelon until it explodes.

46:09.840 --> 46:10.560
Pretty fucking cool.

46:10.560 --> 46:13.360
Hey, rate my delts in this next shot.

46:13.360 --> 46:15.440
Not this one, not this one.

46:15.440 --> 46:17.520
Check out my delts in this next shot.

46:17.520 --> 46:19.040
Wait, hold on.

46:19.040 --> 46:20.160
Fuck, I missed it.

46:20.160 --> 46:22.320
Hey, rewind it and check out my delts in that one.

46:22.320 --> 46:24.880
I feel like they're looking pretty good.

46:24.880 --> 46:26.560
Here, okay, question asker.

46:26.560 --> 46:28.320
Here's your get out of jail free card.

46:28.880 --> 46:31.920
You're going to say, listen, there's a lot to present.

46:31.920 --> 46:33.600
There's a lot to examine here.

46:33.600 --> 46:35.120
I'm going to need some time with this.

46:36.160 --> 46:37.200
I will get back to you.

46:37.200 --> 46:39.680
And then just like a couple days later, email like,

46:39.680 --> 46:40.720
I think it's fantastic.

46:41.440 --> 46:42.480
Keep up the good work.

46:42.480 --> 46:43.360
And then you're out.

46:43.360 --> 46:44.480
You're clear.

46:44.480 --> 46:47.120
What if he said, I want you guys to watch the video

46:47.120 --> 46:49.440
and you just threw a ball peen hammer through your TV.

46:49.440 --> 46:50.560
Yeah, sorry, man.

46:50.560 --> 46:53.280
I dropped all my slime on the VCR.

46:53.280 --> 46:54.960
So I can't, because I slimed it.

46:55.920 --> 46:57.680
I'm sorry, we don't have a VCR.

46:57.680 --> 47:00.880
Well, it's not on video today.

47:00.880 --> 47:02.480
What, then how could I watch it?

47:02.480 --> 47:04.160
Yeah, well, how am I supposed to watch it, Daryl?

47:05.200 --> 47:06.880
You smash your TV and he's like,

47:07.680 --> 47:10.000
it's on this thumb drive and you're like, God damn it.

47:11.280 --> 47:13.120
My computer only does USB-G.

47:13.760 --> 47:15.520
That's the new standard.

47:15.520 --> 47:17.280
Oh, you know, I've never been able to get my computer

47:17.280 --> 47:18.240
to play music videos.

47:19.360 --> 47:20.800
And that would be my only feedback is,

47:20.800 --> 47:22.000
can I be in the next one?

47:22.000 --> 47:23.840
Because I feel like I could really smolder

47:23.840 --> 47:25.120
and pretend to play drums.

47:25.120 --> 47:25.920
Oh, hell yeah.

47:26.640 --> 47:29.200
If I could pretend to play a musical instrument,

47:29.200 --> 47:30.880
please let me be in that music video.

47:30.880 --> 47:37.360
Y'all, his daughter's not even gonna be there.

47:37.360 --> 47:39.440
That's the thing that keeps fucking me up

47:39.440 --> 47:41.600
is his daughter's not gonna be there.

47:41.600 --> 47:44.320
So Phillip's just like chilling.

47:45.600 --> 47:52.240
He's just hanging in Seattle for the grunge scene, I guess.

47:54.000 --> 47:56.960
I'm scared because I want to watch it,

47:56.960 --> 47:59.440
but I don't wanna ask you to post it.

47:59.440 --> 48:01.120
Cause I don't wanna blow up his spot,

48:01.920 --> 48:03.920
but I want to see it.

48:03.920 --> 48:06.400
Not to make fun of it, not to make fun of it.

48:06.400 --> 48:07.760
No, it's just like fill this,

48:07.760 --> 48:09.680
like now it's all your brain getting.

48:09.680 --> 48:13.120
It's like hearing half the chorus of Walking on Broken Glass

48:13.120 --> 48:14.400
and you're like, oh my God, please,

48:14.400 --> 48:16.960
just someone play the song so I can move on with my life.

48:16.960 --> 48:18.000
It's all you wanna hear.

48:18.000 --> 48:20.160
Since you are writing into us saying,

48:20.160 --> 48:21.680
like you feel awkward about this

48:21.680 --> 48:23.280
and you're afraid you're gonna have to do it again,

48:23.280 --> 48:26.320
but you also described the video as not that bad,

48:26.320 --> 48:28.240
which means probably to me,

48:28.240 --> 48:30.080
the video will seem amazing

48:31.040 --> 48:33.760
because I don't have any caveats to it.

48:33.760 --> 48:38.080
So if you are willing to sort of endorse it,

48:39.520 --> 48:40.800
I'm endorsing it,

48:40.800 --> 48:42.720
then think of how good it will be for me.

48:44.000 --> 48:45.840
I'm imagining going out of town

48:47.040 --> 48:49.360
and then our dad goes to stay

48:49.360 --> 48:52.240
at one of my friend's houses here in Austin.

48:53.040 --> 48:55.280
And then after being there a couple of days

48:55.280 --> 48:57.200
and just chilling and playing it cool,

48:57.200 --> 48:58.880
he tells my friends,

48:58.880 --> 49:01.600
I want you guys to give me some feedback on my parkour.

49:01.600 --> 49:04.080
And then he starts doing parkour all around the house.

49:04.080 --> 49:05.360
God, that'd be awesome.

49:05.360 --> 49:07.360
That's essentially what we're dealing with here.

49:07.360 --> 49:09.680
Oh shit, I have a theory.

49:10.480 --> 49:13.360
The reason that Philip Dad is coming

49:13.360 --> 49:15.120
while the daughter's out of town is

49:15.120 --> 49:17.040
after the last time daughter said like,

49:17.040 --> 49:19.120
hey dad, please don't show your music videos

49:19.120 --> 49:20.400
to my friends anymore.

49:20.400 --> 49:22.720
And Philip Dad was like, oh, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah,

49:22.720 --> 49:23.360
you got it.

49:23.360 --> 49:25.280
And then daughter was like, hey, Philip Dad,

49:25.280 --> 49:28.080
I'm going to Mexico for a few days.

49:28.080 --> 49:29.360
Oh, you are, huh?

49:29.920 --> 49:31.680
Okay, have fun.

49:33.120 --> 49:34.480
And this is the loophole.

49:34.480 --> 49:35.840
Philip Dad's gonna get in there

49:35.840 --> 49:37.680
and show them the new music video,

49:37.680 --> 49:39.440
that new heat that he's been working on

49:39.440 --> 49:40.880
with a really cool producer

49:40.880 --> 49:42.560
who also happens to be his manager.

49:43.680 --> 49:45.120
Yeah, and this one's too hot for TV.

49:45.760 --> 49:47.360
Most definitely.

49:47.360 --> 49:49.360
Don't give up on this daddy.

49:49.360 --> 49:51.360
Do not give up on this daddy.

49:51.360 --> 49:53.200
I watched his Star is Born.

49:53.200 --> 49:53.600
Yes.

49:53.600 --> 49:55.760
You could be his Bradley Cooper, and that worked out

49:55.760 --> 49:57.200
really great for all of them.

49:57.200 --> 49:57.920
Bradley Cooper.

49:58.480 --> 50:00.240
Yep, yeah, I guess.

50:00.240 --> 50:01.680
Yep, I guess.

50:01.680 --> 50:02.960
I mean, you fucking said it, so.

50:03.680 --> 50:04.480
Daddy Gaga.

50:06.320 --> 50:06.880
Fuck, man.

50:08.640 --> 50:09.840
Should we do something else?

50:10.560 --> 50:11.440
Like a different show?

50:12.080 --> 50:13.440
Yeah, like a different career.

50:16.000 --> 50:16.480
Music?

50:17.040 --> 50:17.920
We could do music.

50:17.920 --> 50:19.040
Is it too late to do music?

50:19.040 --> 50:20.880
Yeah, I got like my foot in the door there, I feel like.

50:20.880 --> 50:23.200
We should do music videos.

50:23.200 --> 50:24.240
Well, no, no, no.

50:24.240 --> 50:24.800
Thank you.

50:24.800 --> 50:26.400
I want to start a real band with you guys.

50:26.960 --> 50:27.520
Yeah.

50:27.520 --> 50:28.000
Okay.

50:28.000 --> 50:29.680
Get in some real noise shit.

50:29.680 --> 50:31.600
We could start a boy band that's all judges.

50:32.400 --> 50:34.720
That's not a good call, we can't just do a callback joke

50:34.720 --> 50:36.880
because it still feels like we're podcasters

50:36.880 --> 50:37.680
when you said that.

50:37.680 --> 50:38.320
Oh, okay, yeah.

50:38.320 --> 50:42.080
And now, Travis, I do noise funk with your brother Justin,

50:42.080 --> 50:44.480
and I'm giving you my hand, and I'm saying,

50:44.480 --> 50:46.400
do you want to join us on this new ship?

50:47.200 --> 50:48.080
Yes.

50:48.080 --> 50:49.360
What do you bring to the table?

50:49.360 --> 50:52.720
I could do like spoken word over the noise funk.

50:52.720 --> 50:53.120
Yes.

50:53.120 --> 50:53.760
Yeah, you can.

50:55.360 --> 50:57.840
Yeah, so I guess this is our last episode.

50:59.040 --> 51:01.440
Well, it's our last, we're going to keep the feed going,

51:01.440 --> 51:03.280
but we're going to mostly, it's from this point on,

51:03.280 --> 51:05.040
it's mostly going to be noise funk.

51:05.040 --> 51:05.540
Okay.

51:06.480 --> 51:10.320
All right, well, this isn't where I saw today headed,

51:10.320 --> 51:14.000
but you know, sometimes you just got to let go and let God,

51:14.560 --> 51:16.560
which is also going to be the name of our band.

51:16.560 --> 51:17.280
It's the new one.

51:17.280 --> 51:18.400
Yeah, it's a Christian band.

51:18.400 --> 51:19.520
It's a Christian band.

51:19.520 --> 51:20.800
It's a Christian noise funk band,

51:20.800 --> 51:24.960
and it's sort of a sound experience

51:24.960 --> 51:28.320
that you're going to get on a weekly basis on our RSS feed.

51:28.960 --> 51:32.720
And I should also say our goal is not to make pleasurable music,

51:32.720 --> 51:35.280
it's just for it to make honest music.

51:36.240 --> 51:38.400
It'll be pleasurable to the ears of our Lord.

51:38.400 --> 51:38.880
Well, yeah.

51:39.680 --> 51:40.720
Dude loves noise funk.

51:41.280 --> 51:41.780
Loves it.

51:42.640 --> 51:44.000
I think you need to call your housemate

51:44.000 --> 51:48.480
and tell her to come home right now.

51:48.480 --> 51:50.240
Come protect me from your dad.

51:50.240 --> 51:52.000
This is not my problem, Patricia.

51:52.000 --> 51:53.520
Get the fuck back here.

51:53.520 --> 51:55.280
Listen, do you remember you called me

51:55.280 --> 51:57.760
because I left the dirty dishes in the sink too long

51:57.760 --> 51:59.200
and you asked me to take care of it?

51:59.200 --> 52:00.240
Okay, cool.

52:00.240 --> 52:02.400
I'm going to do the same thing, but about your dad.

52:02.400 --> 52:03.440
Okay, thank you very much.

52:04.160 --> 52:05.920
You got to call your dad in to come help you.

52:07.360 --> 52:08.880
Welcome to Daddy's Home 3,

52:09.680 --> 52:12.720
in which John Lithgow makes some music videos, I guess,

52:12.720 --> 52:15.600
and we have to call in another dad.

52:15.600 --> 52:18.160
Let's say Joe Mantegna.

52:18.160 --> 52:20.800
Joe Mantegna's got to come and stop John Lithgow

52:20.800 --> 52:22.000
from making music videos.

52:22.640 --> 52:23.920
Do you think that'll go to series?

52:24.640 --> 52:27.200
Daddy's Home, the series based on the movies.

52:27.200 --> 52:28.880
I'm going to take it back to the woodshed.

52:28.880 --> 52:30.320
I want to work on it a little bit more.

52:30.320 --> 52:30.820
Okay.

52:31.680 --> 52:34.080
I don't even think this is real, Trav.

52:35.840 --> 52:37.200
I don't even think this is a real show.

52:37.200 --> 52:39.520
I thought Joe Mantegna was sitting right here next to you.

52:39.520 --> 52:41.840
You're not a TV producer, so I don't think this is real.

52:41.840 --> 52:42.880
Oh, I'm sorry.

52:42.880 --> 52:45.520
I'm not a TV producer.

52:45.520 --> 52:47.200
I'm not a TV producer.

52:47.200 --> 52:47.920
It feels like a joke.

52:47.920 --> 52:49.120
Joe, Joe, I'm sorry.

52:49.120 --> 52:50.080
Yeah, you can go.

52:50.080 --> 52:51.040
I'm sorry about this, Joe.

52:51.040 --> 52:52.400
Justin, he's not even talking to Joe.

52:52.400 --> 52:52.720
He is.

52:52.720 --> 52:53.760
He's crying.

52:53.760 --> 52:55.440
You make Joe Mantegna cry.

52:55.440 --> 52:56.480
He can't cry.

52:56.480 --> 52:58.640
I can't even follow this bit anymore.

52:58.640 --> 53:00.960
Joe Mantegna's in Cincinnati at my house.

53:02.560 --> 53:06.640
So Prodigal Son revolves around Malcolm Bright,

53:06.640 --> 53:10.000
the son of a notorious serial killer named The Surgeon,

53:10.000 --> 53:12.160
who understands how killers think.

53:12.160 --> 53:14.160
The criminal psychologist uses his skills

53:14.160 --> 53:17.440
to help the NYPD solve crimes and stop killers

53:17.440 --> 53:19.680
while balancing his manipulative mother,

53:19.680 --> 53:23.040
an annoyingly normal sister, and a homicidal father

53:23.040 --> 53:25.760
still looking to bond with his prodigal son.

53:25.760 --> 53:27.680
The drama is described as a fresh take

53:27.680 --> 53:30.560
on the crime franchise with a darkly comedic tone.

53:32.160 --> 53:35.440
Yeah, that one's got Lou Diamond Phillips

53:35.440 --> 53:36.800
and Michael Sheen in it.

53:36.800 --> 53:37.680
Whoa, really?

53:37.680 --> 53:40.720
See, that's a pickup, my dude.

53:40.720 --> 53:41.920
You think that one's a pickup?

53:41.920 --> 53:42.800
Griffin, what do you think?

53:43.680 --> 53:44.720
Who cares, man?

53:45.920 --> 53:47.840
I don't really watch fucking TV anymore.

53:49.040 --> 53:50.560
Okay, well, it was a word of the series.

53:50.560 --> 53:51.760
Travis does it again.

53:51.760 --> 53:54.480
Travis, you have an incredible hit rate for this bit.

53:54.480 --> 53:56.960
I have to say, you are extremely good at this.

53:57.520 --> 53:58.640
This is what I should have done.

53:59.280 --> 54:01.040
I should have been somebody who just guessed

54:01.040 --> 54:03.040
at which TV shows get made.

54:03.040 --> 54:04.240
That's what you should have done.

54:04.240 --> 54:06.080
I'm the key demographic.

54:06.080 --> 54:09.200
I'm the person everybody seems to be making TV shows for.

54:11.360 --> 54:12.880
You're a 35-year-old white man,

54:12.880 --> 54:14.640
so yeah, you're explicitly that.

54:14.640 --> 54:15.360
Sounds about right.

54:15.920 --> 54:17.280
Folks, this has been our podcast

54:17.280 --> 54:18.960
with my brother and my brother and me.

54:18.960 --> 54:20.640
We're sorry it got weird at the end,

54:20.640 --> 54:23.040
but we enjoyed ourselves before that,

54:23.040 --> 54:24.080
and we hope you did too.

54:24.080 --> 54:26.000
And remember, as we say every week,

54:26.000 --> 54:28.240
you're welcome to turn it off whenever you want to

54:28.880 --> 54:30.400
and go do other stuff.

54:30.400 --> 54:31.440
It's fine.

54:31.440 --> 54:33.280
Sometimes the wheels are gonna fall off.

54:33.280 --> 54:34.880
Guys, we're just three brothers.

54:34.880 --> 54:37.440
You can always put some of the show into a doggie bag,

54:37.440 --> 54:39.120
take it home, put it in the refrigerator,

54:39.120 --> 54:40.720
swear you'll eat some more later,

54:40.720 --> 54:42.480
but then think, hold it's been sitting in there

54:42.480 --> 54:44.480
for like seven days, then throw it out.

54:44.480 --> 54:45.360
That's fine.

54:45.360 --> 54:47.200
We also, because we didn't want to give you

54:47.200 --> 54:48.720
a bunch of live episodes in a row,

54:48.720 --> 54:50.720
managed to record four of these bad boys

54:50.720 --> 54:51.840
in the course of a week,

54:53.440 --> 54:55.360
which was just poor planning on our part.

54:55.360 --> 54:56.240
We're sorry about that.

54:56.240 --> 54:57.440
We love you very much.

54:57.440 --> 54:58.160
Thanks to John.

54:59.120 --> 54:59.620
Fuck.

55:00.400 --> 55:01.040
Fuck me.

55:01.040 --> 55:02.480
John Roderick knows how I feel about him.

55:02.480 --> 55:03.280
Start over.

55:03.280 --> 55:03.840
Hi, everybody.

55:03.840 --> 55:05.280
Welcome, my brother, my brother, and me.

55:05.280 --> 55:06.880
Thanks, Maxwell and Fun.

55:06.880 --> 55:08.320
All these great shows are there.

55:08.880 --> 55:10.240
Speaking of live shows,

55:10.880 --> 55:13.520
we've got some coming up in Indianapolis and Nashville

55:13.520 --> 55:14.880
in the middle of June.

55:14.880 --> 55:15.760
Go get your tickets.

55:15.760 --> 55:16.880
We have other ones too.

55:16.880 --> 55:18.800
You could get some in Atlanta.

55:18.800 --> 55:20.960
There's other, I think like the second half of the year

55:20.960 --> 55:22.160
is more or less sold out,

55:23.200 --> 55:24.560
but we've got our live shows.

55:24.560 --> 55:26.880
And also, when you're hearing this,

55:27.680 --> 55:31.120
the Adventure Zone book tour tickets will be on sale

55:31.120 --> 55:32.640
and might be sold out already.

55:32.640 --> 55:35.520
But you can go to McElroy.Family and click on tours

55:35.520 --> 55:36.720
and get those tickets.

55:36.720 --> 55:38.320

55:38.320 --> 55:40.160

55:55.840 --> 55:58.320
Hey, thanks to John Roderick and Maxwell and Fun.

55:58.320 --> 55:59.120
I already did that.

55:59.120 --> 56:00.320
Juice, you got anything to keep?

56:00.320 --> 56:04.320
But hey, listen, folks, we have a bunch of merchandise

56:04.320 --> 56:06.400
you can go buy if you go to McElroyMerch.com

56:07.200 --> 56:09.040

You can find links to merchandise

56:10.480 --> 56:13.600

56:13.600 --> 56:15.520
this one and a lot of others.

56:15.520 --> 56:16.800
I have a cereal podcast.

56:16.800 --> 56:18.240
It's for people with anxiety

56:18.240 --> 56:19.840
or people who just want to chill out.

56:19.840 --> 56:22.400
It's called The Empty Bowl and it's about cereal,

56:22.400 --> 56:24.000
but it's a meditative podcast about cereal.

56:25.120 --> 56:26.880
And if you want to check that out, it's on iTunes.

56:26.880 --> 56:28.080
I'll give that plug this week.

56:28.080 --> 56:30.480
That's my plug.

56:30.480 --> 56:31.520
You want the final Yahoo?

56:32.080 --> 56:32.960
Yes, please.

56:32.960 --> 56:33.200
Yeah.

56:33.840 --> 56:35.280
This one was sent in by a couple folks.

56:35.280 --> 56:37.040
Thanks, everybody who sent this in.

56:37.040 --> 56:39.200
It's an anonymous Yahoo Answers user I'm going to call.

56:40.880 --> 56:41.680
Nana asks,

56:43.760 --> 56:46.160

My name is Justin McElroy.

56:54.160 --> 56:55.200

56:55.200 --> 56:56.480

Have you ever watched a movie so bad

57:23.760 --> 57:25.920
you just needed to talk to somebody about it?

57:25.920 --> 57:27.280
Well, here at the Flophouse,

we watch a bad movie and then talk about it.

57:29.600 --> 57:31.040
Yeah, you don't have to do anything.

We'll watch it and we'll talk it.
