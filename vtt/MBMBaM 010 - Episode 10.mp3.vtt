WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
If you change your mind

00:30.840 --> 00:32.840
I

00:33.600 --> 00:35.600
Don't want to do this

00:38.200 --> 00:43.820
I'm brothers together for advising telling people

00:44.840 --> 00:46.840
Tell them what they don't what?

00:47.440 --> 00:51.960
Three of us are around a mic and we're so close

00:52.880 --> 00:58.000
It's despicable like it's gross. I can feel I am feel

00:58.000 --> 01:01.800
I feel Griffin's whiskers on my cheek. There's an odd number of us

01:01.800 --> 01:03.640
I think you're too far you got to come close

01:03.640 --> 01:07.680
I think we call I say this because we only have one mic so I know for a fact you have to get close

01:07.680 --> 01:12.000
We got to take a vote if we should continue this show or if we should just abort it

01:12.480 --> 01:14.680
When would we do it if we aborted it?

01:15.640 --> 01:22.360
We'll figure out another time. I support our right to choose. All right, so advice, right? What's the story with that?

01:22.360 --> 01:26.760
Is that is that how we're beginning the episode? That's the beginning of the episode? Yeah, that's how it begins

01:26.760 --> 01:34.140
Advice, what's the story with that? What is the story? What's the dealio? What's the dealio? Hey, that's for some queries

01:34.760 --> 01:39.760
Hey there, ma'am. My boyfriend has been struggling with an addiction to internet porn for a long time

01:40.120 --> 01:45.720
Neither he nor I like this issue that he has to deal with and would rather him get over it as soon as possible

01:46.280 --> 01:50.740
What can I do to help? What are your suggestions to him? Thanks tannery what?

01:51.400 --> 01:53.680
Tannery, all right. Well, that'll allow it

01:53.680 --> 01:55.520
Um

01:55.520 --> 02:02.180
Let me see if I get this straight you your BF your boyfriend is addicted to internet porn. Can you be addicted?

02:02.240 --> 02:06.160
No, that is not a thing. It happens addiction is a physical thing

02:07.080 --> 02:09.080
So he really likes internet porn

02:09.760 --> 02:12.060
How do you stop that get it?

02:13.440 --> 02:17.780
We live without the internet for thousands of years just cancel it. Yeah, just get it sexy

02:18.400 --> 02:22.840
Just one. I'm just saying if she's asking for a way to help she needs to get it sexy

02:22.840 --> 02:24.840
I don't know what getting a sex

02:25.320 --> 02:31.640
Yeah, tannery needs to sex it up. She needs to replace internet porn. What what what human have you seen the internet?

02:31.640 --> 02:35.840
What like the things those people are willing to do are just despicable

02:35.840 --> 02:39.520
How how could a regular woman help hope to live up to that?

02:39.520 --> 02:41.760
Well, I guess the real question is how much do you love your boyfriend?

02:41.840 --> 02:49.480
You love your boyfriend enough to foot crush some stuff. I'm talking about like the difference between love and just physical like just laws

02:49.480 --> 02:56.040
You can't be as big as the internet. You can't be as sexy as it internet's on 24-7. It's available for you

02:56.040 --> 03:01.880
It's gonna cater to whatever bizarre desire you want. The air is like a sex Hydra, right?

03:02.360 --> 03:06.480
Sex Hydra, you can cut off its heads, but in other words just gonna spring right back into place. Yeah

03:07.680 --> 03:10.040
so I would say

03:10.960 --> 03:14.760
Cancel your internet because it's the only way you got to keep them from the internet because the internet is

03:14.760 --> 03:21.960
Pretty much just porn these days or maybe it's something you two could share together. Watch that internet porn together. Make it a magical

03:23.080 --> 03:24.200
weird

03:24.200 --> 03:26.560
Weird, maybe you need to cancel your boyfriend

03:27.240 --> 03:32.280
Justin you're pushing me. You're not cancel the mic. We got one mic. Do you remember one mic?

03:32.280 --> 03:35.760
Remember this one mic one level look pretty tight, but I'm saying

03:37.320 --> 03:43.040
Cancel cancel that cancel that boyfriend. I'm a chubby guy and I've never been a relationship. That's half true

03:43.040 --> 03:49.000
I've not it's not that I have a problem talking to bitches or anything. It's just there's your problem right there

03:49.000 --> 03:52.280
You got to stop calling them bitches. No, he didn't call bitches girls

03:52.360 --> 03:55.560
It's just the only girls I find attractive are out of my league and can never

03:55.840 --> 04:00.960
Work up the courage to actually ask them out all let me help you out with this man. Lower them standards

04:02.660 --> 04:08.160
You got them too high you're reaching for dust bunnies on the ceiling we got shit under your couch it needs to be dealt with

04:08.160 --> 04:13.440
Lower that standard there's no such thing as out of your league, bro

04:13.760 --> 04:20.520
Yeah, except there is be that way. Wait, let me correct you. There's no such things out your league if you're hugely physically attractive

04:21.520 --> 04:24.880
Because then anything is within your reach I would say

04:25.440 --> 04:28.440
Your problem is you're getting intimidated because you don't have the skills yet

04:28.600 --> 04:33.600
You're trying to friggin knock one out of the park when you should just be trying to pick up a grounder

04:33.600 --> 04:38.760
You know, everyone wants to buy that Corvette first car out. Yeah, you just don't have the capital for that man

04:38.760 --> 04:45.240
You're gonna need to get that used Kia. Yeah, you know the juice you consider hopping on that Atkins diet train get that Atkins

04:45.440 --> 04:50.800
Hit that ketosis drop about 50 get your key to get your keyed up drop about 50 in a week

04:50.800 --> 04:55.360
And then you pick up a fly honey, and then you start eating your breads and your balloon again

04:55.360 --> 05:00.080
And then you look right up and you're like too late. You're already with this lady confusion. She'll never know

05:00.080 --> 05:06.400
Fuckin hey, yeah answers user Charlie asks Christians if we did discover aliens

05:06.400 --> 05:09.220
Should we share the gospel with them? Does Jesus love aliens too?

05:11.080 --> 05:13.080
Deep I

05:13.120 --> 05:17.320
Would think that it takes so much energy to love people

05:18.400 --> 05:23.560
That like he's got to have an outlet and the outlet is probably hating people from other

05:24.680 --> 05:29.080
I love everyone on earth, but everywhere else fuck them

05:29.080 --> 05:30.800
Well, do you remember?

05:30.800 --> 05:37.720
Independence Day right the end of Independence Day right when Will Smith he fired the nuke, but it didn't go off

05:38.480 --> 05:45.120
Until a miracle happened and then I blew up the mothership and saying that miracle was Randy Quaid that miracle is Jesus love

05:45.520 --> 05:47.520
Blowing up aliens through Randy Quaid

05:48.160 --> 05:50.440
Through Randy Quaid Randy Quaid wasn't in that film

05:50.440 --> 05:54.840
Yeah, it was you're too young to remember because you just remember him as a hero because you're a child

05:54.840 --> 06:00.840
You've replaced him in your mind's eye with Jesus, isn't that Dennis Quaid? Now it's Randy

06:02.880 --> 06:06.640
He does hate he does hate people from other planets but at the

06:07.440 --> 06:12.200
Millennial Jesus convention, he always covers it up for like he doesn't tell Mars Jesus that he hates

06:12.960 --> 06:16.800
Martian so it's a franchise, right? Because I've always assumed the Jesus franchise

06:16.800 --> 06:24.600
Ah Jupiter Jesus is my new stage name. You should have been there. You should have been there when they excommunicated Pluto Jesus

06:26.160 --> 06:28.160
It was crazy

06:28.160 --> 06:30.960
No, no Jesus's for moons. Get out of here

06:32.560 --> 06:34.560
Pluto Jesus is also my favorite Eddie Murphy movie

06:36.480 --> 06:38.480
This summer

06:39.520 --> 06:43.560
Eddie Murphy is Pluto Jesus. I work as a lead to the coffee house

06:43.560 --> 06:49.400
How can I best impress the virtue of cleaning up after oneself on my co-workers and boss?

06:49.400 --> 06:54.760
I still don't know. Hey, you're not the boss. Don't fucking worry about it. Yeah, don't worry about your boss

06:54.760 --> 07:00.100
Let him do his thing your co-workers just the first time they leave trash around pick it up and throw it at their face

07:00.560 --> 07:07.280
Probably when they're busy slash a couple tires and that shit changes around real quick. Just be careful that you don't get murdered

07:07.840 --> 07:09.840
Wow, man. Yeah, don't get murdered

07:11.200 --> 07:12.640
Seriously

07:12.640 --> 07:18.320
There's a callback to last week's show. It's okay. It was a long time ago. It's been a long week

07:22.760 --> 07:25.440
Just don't get murdered the 21st of June will be my birthday

07:26.680 --> 07:31.200
Looking for advice on how to kick it like a McElroy any suggestions sort of drinking out of children's beach toys

07:33.240 --> 07:35.880
Would be much obliged as I'm only turning 19

07:38.040 --> 07:40.040
James

07:40.040 --> 07:45.040
James 19 years old. That's a rough age because you're not an adult

07:46.320 --> 07:51.040
Anymore, I mean you're still an adult, but you're not turning into an adult and you're still two years away from any practical upshot

07:51.920 --> 07:53.920
Even 20 is cool cuz you're in your 20s

07:54.760 --> 07:57.280
So I guess I'm saying is keep it on the silent

07:59.280 --> 08:00.560
Oh

08:00.560 --> 08:06.800
I thought you're saying like sit at home by yourself. Keep it quiet. Don't bother people with it, man

08:06.800 --> 08:12.640
Nobody cares calls to the year. It's just keep it quiet

08:13.160 --> 08:16.920
So you're not suggesting he practiced some surreptitious flaskmanship

08:16.920 --> 08:22.720
No, no, just take a chill pill. Everybody's first question is gonna be how old are you me like 20 19. They'll be like, yeah

08:23.480 --> 08:25.480
What did you do? Okay. Well

08:26.160 --> 08:28.160
Not a big deal, but I guess

08:28.680 --> 08:35.120
19 wasn't a great year. So have fun James. You did it. Enjoy it. Yeah. Enjoy it. Drink it in drink it deep

08:35.120 --> 08:37.120
I

08:37.720 --> 08:40.900
Haven't been for a checkup in years and decided it's about that time

08:41.160 --> 08:46.300
The only problem is I really like this like the idea of another guy touching my wiener

08:48.560 --> 08:54.400
Whatever the context what I come across as some degenerate if I asked specifically for a female doctor

08:54.400 --> 09:00.720
Is it normal for a guy to outright refuse to have a male doctor in a wiener related circumstance?

09:00.720 --> 09:08.440
I I feel so completely the opposite on this subject that I only want a dude touching my wiener when it comes to

09:09.040 --> 09:13.080
What if you have a female doctor and she chuckles? What if there's a chuckle?

09:13.080 --> 09:15.140
I made the decision when I went in that

09:15.640 --> 09:20.380
He was gonna be just as uncomfortable as I am like if I'm gonna be uncomfortable in this situation

09:20.760 --> 09:26.280
Guess what brah? So are you put your finger in my butthole try to use the phrase get it as much as possible?

09:26.280 --> 09:31.880
So like mmm get it or just like that

09:33.280 --> 09:36.040
Just like that one finger. That's all you can get

09:38.680 --> 09:43.600
Sometimes you can distract yourself from feeling awkward by making someone else feel worse. I

09:45.320 --> 09:50.520
Mean more awkward or just worse just insert them while they're down there holding your wiener

09:50.520 --> 09:52.520
It's like by the way, your haircut is ugly

09:52.520 --> 09:58.600
So go into the office fully erect is basically what you're saying and don't ever address it like this. This is

10:03.240 --> 10:06.160
Why don't you try to remember he's trying to keep you from having prostate cancer

10:07.160 --> 10:15.240
You you terrible terrible selfish person out the worst. He's not gonna touch your wiener worst-case scenario. He's gonna cup them balls

10:16.840 --> 10:20.640
It's not biggie no big juice that nut yahoo answers user

10:20.640 --> 10:23.920
Tesorio asks, how do my nipples hurt?

10:25.880 --> 10:28.800
Did you saw that please how do my nipples hurt I

10:29.840 --> 10:34.320
Think that's supposed to be how do my nipples hurt and not like some sort of archaic like Oh

10:34.960 --> 10:36.560
Do my nipples hurt?

10:36.560 --> 10:42.080
I went swimming today at the lake while we were in the water for like an hour or so and my nipples started hurting like

10:42.080 --> 10:48.000
After an hour. Why is that? I was wearing a t-shirt. They really hurt like they sting. What can I do to make it stop?

10:48.000 --> 10:54.240
It's the t-shirt man. They're your nipples are sensitive. Some people say they're the most sensitive organ on your body

10:54.960 --> 10:57.200
And you've got a wet t-shirt there. They're just

11:00.200 --> 11:02.200
Rubbing

11:04.120 --> 11:09.000
Just run I had it we had remember those boogie boards we got once the beach one time

11:09.000 --> 11:10.880
I got these boogie boards again about it

11:10.880 --> 11:12.360
They had the texture of sandpaper

11:12.360 --> 11:17.440
We would just dive in the ocean on them like nipple first like we land directly on our nipples

11:17.440 --> 11:23.880
Funny McElroy fact our chests are all sandpaper smooth like all like nipples gone. No belly buttons

11:23.880 --> 11:26.160
It's just a flat sheet. It's really weird

11:27.120 --> 11:28.640
medical mysteries

11:28.640 --> 11:34.900
Griffin ask a question. I want to do is two yahoos in a row. I'm president. What is the best flavor of jelly?

11:37.480 --> 11:40.400
We don't have to answer this one but someone went on the internet

11:41.080 --> 11:44.280
With this burning question that he had to fucking crowdsource

11:44.280 --> 11:49.720
What is the best flavor of the worst things? He's still I'm looking at zero answers. That means he's still sad

11:50.240 --> 11:53.000
Still standing at the curve. There's actually ten answers

11:54.360 --> 11:56.360
strawberry

11:59.360 --> 12:03.600
Flavor jelly get that jelly. It's just a matter of opinion. Mine is peach

12:04.160 --> 12:10.760
Great, but even better is grape jam pear preserves by Braswell's are awesome boob flavor get it

12:10.760 --> 12:14.640
All right, strawberry raspberry. I love orange marmalade

12:14.840 --> 12:21.940
But my favorite is whatever is available for toast at the time. It depends on the person. I personally prefer grape boys and dairy

12:23.120 --> 12:27.580
What a weirdo. I don't know what he said. Hey, why I don't know what he say

12:27.580 --> 12:33.480
Hey as un-clever and awful as these people are nobody said can they really are the worst and the worst is being the only

12:33.480 --> 12:35.480
No, it's worse that someone

12:35.480 --> 12:41.720
Is curious what other people think about jelly or that someone thinks that they're curious about what they think about jelly

12:41.880 --> 12:44.080
Like I'm gonna get on here and answer this guy. He needs

12:44.520 --> 12:48.680
But listen Robbie if you are listening get that rose jelly we had some of those

12:49.360 --> 12:53.080
Jesus it's delicious. You can only get in Britain, but it's worth the investment

12:54.160 --> 12:58.720
Smear that on your English muffin. I have two gay brothers whose wedding

13:00.040 --> 13:04.000
Sorry, I miss read it. I miss read it. I have a gay brother whose wedding is coming up soon

13:04.000 --> 13:05.880
I'm the best man at the wedding

13:05.880 --> 13:09.720
I am very happy for him and I wish him the best of luck my girlfriend

13:09.800 --> 13:14.480
Who is supposed to come with me to the wedding has expressed her dislike for gay rights and gay marriage

13:14.860 --> 13:19.260
She's expressed her unwillingness to come to the wedding due to her own beliefs. What the fuck do I do?

13:19.880 --> 13:25.360
Andrew that's a tough putt man. Thank you. Wicked sick you wicked. I've been thinking about this and I have an idea

13:25.360 --> 13:29.720
I'd like to play a game. All right, we're gonna play a point counterpoint game, right?

13:29.720 --> 13:36.560
Which one of my Justin you are going to be pro gay marriage Griffin. You are going to be anti gay marriage Justin go

13:36.760 --> 13:40.240
Okay, I think gay should be married. Okay, Griffin go

13:41.280 --> 13:44.600
It's yucky. It's sake. It's a union that I

13:45.240 --> 13:48.080
Respect and frankly love is real

13:48.640 --> 13:51.000
Well, is it real if it's two mouths?

13:51.000 --> 13:55.520
Maybe in your man mouth has been married for time five seven times, right?

13:55.520 --> 14:01.280
But how Andrew I hope that helps how many times they married men how many times is man mouth? That's another man mouth

14:01.280 --> 14:03.280
What's wrong with that? It's beautiful

14:03.760 --> 14:09.440
Guys, I've seen a lot of movies and I know the way that this shakes out is that the

14:09.960 --> 14:11.960
Your brother and his free-spirited

14:13.520 --> 14:16.120
Husband meet your girlfriend and they

14:16.840 --> 14:21.280
Enchant her with their love and convince her that she was wrong all along. I've seen Lacoste

14:21.280 --> 14:28.160
I feel I know how it goes or or it pulls the saving Silverman and you you kick a man to Pete to the curb

14:28.240 --> 14:33.040
Yeah, and and also probably the case is she just doesn't want to go to the wedding because going to wedding sucks

14:33.160 --> 14:37.800
So gay or straight wedding. Okay weddings are the bomb. You know, are they fun? They're dope

14:37.800 --> 14:42.040
Yeah, I've been the one I gotta get down on that. They're very brief and the catering is usually very snappy

14:42.040 --> 14:44.200
Yeah, and everyone wears briefs, which is weird

14:44.200 --> 14:50.520
My first wedding anniversary is coming up on July 21st

14:50.520 --> 14:53.480
You can use your expert advice on a cool gift for my husband

14:53.480 --> 14:59.680
His primary hobby is gay being gaming but I typically steer away from buying games as he researches and buys those for himself

14:59.920 --> 15:02.240
He also loves our college basketball team

15:03.160 --> 15:05.920
That's nondescript, but I've already bought him all sorts of

15:07.000 --> 15:13.000
Local team I he enjoys local team all sorts of teen related perfinity over the years now. I'm at a loss

15:13.000 --> 15:16.520
So I'm hoping that y'all can come up with a great anniversary gift for a 30 year old guy

15:16.720 --> 15:18.720
Any suggestions will be much appreciated?

15:19.080 --> 15:23.920

15:24.120 --> 15:29.440

15:29.440 --> 15:33.240

It's a gift that says hey, I'm cool. I'm down. I know you have needs and this is a guide made specially for you

15:46.440 --> 15:49.360
I feel like we used up all of our good gift suggestions last week

15:49.360 --> 15:52.920
But I'm sure we still got some in the tank. Have you considered a home brewing kit? Oh

15:53.520 --> 15:56.640
Always good home bring kids a very is a great idea

15:57.680 --> 15:59.680

16:00.240 --> 16:04.920
If your beer to be done cooking as you explore all the new pornography sites at Tenry's husband

To

16:08.880 --> 16:10.400
Meats

16:10.400 --> 16:12.400
Some form of meats maybe a meat

16:13.160 --> 16:16.020
Subscription a meat of the month Club. Is that a thing that exists?

16:16.020 --> 16:19.840
Sure, it should be noted that the two of them haven't received a gift for many years

16:19.840 --> 16:25.640
So this is largely from memory and what they read in Charles Dickens books torches buck knives

16:27.760 --> 16:29.760
Coffers darning wool

16:29.760 --> 16:34.300
Orphans how many orphans does a bolt of calico?

16:36.080 --> 16:43.040
Twine does he have houses twine houses lard. How about a lesson in love Yahoo answers user on asks. How do you French kiss?

16:43.760 --> 16:46.760
Well first you need to find a partner then you would just kiss regularly

16:46.760 --> 16:50.560
But you need to put your tongue in each other's mouth. There is so much more to it

16:51.440 --> 16:54.960
You know what there is so much more to it than that fuck honor for

16:54.960 --> 17:00.600
Asking how to French kiss then explaining how to French kiss. Is it a question or an answer on a no?

17:00.600 --> 17:04.480
He's always great. One of the answers is don't suddenly put it in and wiggle it around

17:05.560 --> 17:11.600
But that's a turnoff. You need to do it very gently and softly good advice in the link above

17:11.600 --> 17:15.620
That's how I learn to do it. And then there's a link to a wiki page on how to French kiss

17:15.960 --> 17:21.040
Fuck you internet. Fuck the internet. I had to learn that shit at 15 by myself scared like

17:21.040 --> 17:26.480
How's it my problem with the internet for every site? That's like, how do you make you know baked potato?

17:26.480 --> 17:31.720
It's like oh, it's really helpful. Then someone feels the need to create a page. It's like here's how you French kiss. Fuck you

17:31.720 --> 17:37.480
I don't need it. What why is that a thing on the internet that I would ever look up? Why are you stopping such a sinner?

17:39.080 --> 17:45.320
Everyone's got to figure that shit out by themselves at age 15 and it's like going into an arena against an angry lion

17:45.320 --> 17:49.320
and it's the scariest moment in your life, you know, you're either gonna come out a champion or

17:49.320 --> 17:52.800
You'll be fish mouth for the rest of your high school career

17:53.160 --> 17:59.540
Okay, almost two months ago my fiancee and I broke up after dating for five and a half years

18:00.120 --> 18:04.560
We are still living with each other were and but I will be moving out July 1st

18:04.560 --> 18:09.260
Okay, within the last month I discovered that she has been hooking up with my best friend since childhood

18:09.960 --> 18:11.960
That is gross

18:13.200 --> 18:17.400
Obviously I'm angry about this since he was slated to be my best man

18:17.400 --> 18:20.720
and he was when this whole time he was hers and

18:21.760 --> 18:25.160
That was I just extemporaneous that it wasn't in the email

18:26.280 --> 18:29.640
The first person I turned to for consolation after the breakup. Oh

18:30.360 --> 18:33.400
Ouch, man, and even with my knowledge of this

18:33.400 --> 18:37.560
He still continues to talk to her and I know that things are going to pick up more so after I move

18:37.560 --> 18:47.560
I've tried to get past this but in my mind, it's very difficult. I value my friendship with both of these people. Why?

18:47.560 --> 18:50.880
And I don't want to waste my life holding grudges

18:50.880 --> 18:53.680
I know they didn't do this with any intended malice towards me

18:53.680 --> 18:57.600
But it's very difficult to put behind me any advice on how to deal with it. Jeff

18:57.600 --> 19:04.280
I gotta say man, you're already dealing with this pretty cool. I mean, but you did you seem to be dealing with this pretty maturely

19:04.280 --> 19:08.680
You're gonna feel hurt it's gonna happen, but don't be in a rush to try to forgive him

19:09.320 --> 19:13.000
Sometimes no matter how much you care about people you gotta say fuck you

19:13.000 --> 19:17.800
That's some cold shit life. And and if I can play devil's advocate here Jeff

19:18.400 --> 19:26.040
Intended or not. This is your ex-fiance of five and a half years and best friends since childhood. So the malice

19:26.760 --> 19:31.840
Whether they should that's something they probably considered and said fuck it. He'll be mad

19:31.840 --> 19:36.240
So there is a little bit of not so good feelings there

19:36.240 --> 19:41.520
So it's it's perfectly normal that you're still still dealing with it and not completely over it. Fuck him Jeff

19:42.080 --> 19:47.160
Fuck him Jeff get out of there. Yeah, screw them Jeff move out before July 1st, July 1st

19:47.160 --> 19:49.160
Jeff you can get him come stay with us

19:50.040 --> 19:53.320
This is a safe place. Come stay with Griffin come stay with

19:54.360 --> 19:58.440
Perfect to do your armies. Hey guys. Hey

19:58.440 --> 20:05.640
So this last year I had my own apartment and it was where my friends and I would hang out basically all the time

20:06.120 --> 20:11.360
Because it was centrally located between all of us and be the lack of parents rents

20:11.360 --> 20:17.640
If you prefer was nice as well, but because of grades and money, I'm moving back home with my parents in August

20:17.640 --> 20:24.480
It's putting me closer to some of my friends, but putting me almost 20 to 30 minutes away from some others

20:24.480 --> 20:29.400
I just worried our group of friends is going to fall apart without that central place to hang out

20:29.960 --> 20:33.680
What can I and my friends as a group do to make sure this doesn't happen?

20:34.160 --> 20:38.720
You gotta find a peach pit. Hey Ian, how about you focus on your grades?

20:39.040 --> 20:42.160
Yeah, so you can move out of your parents house and get a job

20:42.720 --> 20:49.040
And your peach pit find your peach pit. It sounds like he's a high schooler. That's how he's a high schooler with his own apartment

20:49.040 --> 20:51.040
He's doogie Howser. Yeah

20:51.040 --> 20:59.040
Listen dumb shit, if you're not even gonna listen to the questions. I can't I can't what advice are you gonna give that's gonna be worthwhile or practical
