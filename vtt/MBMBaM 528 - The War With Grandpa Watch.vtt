00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.640 --> 00:49.520
Hello, everybody. Welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me, an advice show for the modern era.

00:49.520 --> 00:53.920
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. Let me check my show notes right here. Yes,

00:53.920 --> 00:56.560
it says I'm your middle-aged brother, Travis McElroy.

00:56.560 --> 01:02.320
I'm Griffin. I don't need show notes. I got my name from my mommy and daddy at birth,

01:02.960 --> 01:06.960
and that's the one I've stuck with using, so I don't need show notes like Travis did.

01:06.960 --> 01:10.000
Justin, did you have an intro? You kind of just barreled into this.

01:10.000 --> 01:13.760
Yeah, we had barely finished syncing up our count, and you were just like,

01:14.800 --> 01:18.880
I don't know. What's that mean? Where are we? What's happening? Set the scene.

01:20.160 --> 01:24.800
I'm looking at the movie release calendar, and I'm just pretty excited about all the upcoming

01:24.800 --> 01:29.040
releases we got coming to movie theaters. I mean, is this a watch watch? Are we watching?

01:29.040 --> 01:32.640
It's watching for the future watches. All right. We're watching The Watchman.

01:32.640 --> 01:37.440
What's the slate look like ahead of us? I want to talk about the upcoming slate

01:37.440 --> 01:39.440
in the context of this. Cool.

01:39.440 --> 01:45.440
Will people risk getting COVID-19 to go see it? First up, War with Grandpa.

01:47.120 --> 01:51.120
Tell me about War with Grandpa. Wait, can I guess? I'm just going to guess.

01:51.120 --> 01:55.280
Is Johnny Knoxville in it? No. No, you're thinking of Bad Grandpa.

01:55.280 --> 01:58.320
This is not a sequel. Although, if I'm going to go to war with a grandpa,

01:58.320 --> 02:01.360
it's going to be a bad one. Yeah, right? I'd feel terrible going

02:01.360 --> 02:04.640
to war with a nice grandpa. Is this in the Focker's verse?

02:05.200 --> 02:08.800
Oh, good question. Robert De Niro is Ed.

02:08.800 --> 02:13.440
He did one with that Zac Efron, right? Where he was a bad grandpa.

02:13.440 --> 02:18.160
Yes, but in this one, he's a bad grandpa who's going to war with, let's see,

02:18.160 --> 02:22.000
the tagline for this one is old school versus new cool.

02:22.720 --> 02:25.200
And there's a boy. Say it again.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.760
Old school versus new cool. Oh, fuck yeah.

02:30.400 --> 02:36.640
Hey, I'm sorry. I'm pretty sure, I realize they're different movies in reality,

02:36.640 --> 02:40.480
but I'm pretty sure that could also have been the tagline

02:40.480 --> 02:45.280
for the Robert De Niro Zac Efron movie. Or Grumpy Old Men, or Grumpier Old Men,

02:45.280 --> 02:48.800
or Road Dogs. Or Meet the Fockers.

02:48.800 --> 02:51.360
Was Focker especially cool? You could use it for Fockers.

02:51.360 --> 02:54.160
You could use it for Camp Nowhere. You could use it.

02:54.160 --> 02:59.360
Here's the thing, because I'm so glad this tagline's out there,

02:59.360 --> 03:03.040
enticing people with this fucking Pied Piper siren song

03:03.040 --> 03:09.120
into these COVID filled theaters, that they finally popularized the phrase

03:09.120 --> 03:12.160
new cool. I'm saying that on the regular.

03:12.160 --> 03:17.360
I'm always saying like, oh, did you check out this guy on Instagram,

03:18.720 --> 03:22.080
his board shorts? That's the new cool, baby.

03:22.960 --> 03:26.960
What happened to Robert De Niro? Do you think that he went from like,

03:27.840 --> 03:31.280
you know, in Oscar winning movies, and I assume he has won an Oscar,

03:31.280 --> 03:35.040
I don't know for sure, to then just like, from now on,

03:35.040 --> 03:37.920
I'm going to play the grandpa. I'm just going to play,

03:37.920 --> 03:40.960
but not even the grandpa in Oscar contender movies,

03:40.960 --> 03:44.000
but I'm going to play him in like college comedies,

03:44.000 --> 03:48.080
where maybe there's like a spring break scene, or the whole movie spring break.

03:48.080 --> 03:50.400
That's me. That's Robert De Niro now.

03:50.400 --> 03:54.080
None of what you're saying makes any difference whatsoever,

03:54.080 --> 03:56.560
because I'm going to talk about Oaks Fegley.

03:56.560 --> 03:57.920
What? Oaks Fegley,

03:57.920 --> 04:00.240
I'm not even sure what that is. Oaks Fegley.

04:00.240 --> 04:02.400
Is that the name of a movie or a person or a place?

04:02.400 --> 04:05.040
Oaks Fegley is going to war with grandpa.

04:05.040 --> 04:07.280
Wait, it's a person?

04:07.280 --> 04:10.160
You may remember him from some previous rules.

04:10.160 --> 04:14.080
Like Boy, Paul, Young Brian, Pete, Ben.

04:14.080 --> 04:15.120
I love Young Brian.

04:15.120 --> 04:16.400
Young Brian's funny.

04:16.400 --> 04:18.400
I'm literally just reading, this is his credits.

04:18.400 --> 04:19.680
You ready? This is just names.

04:19.680 --> 04:23.920
Boy, Michael, Paul, Young Judd, Young Elias Thompson,

04:23.920 --> 04:28.080
Young Brian, Pete, Ben, Boy, Little Josh,

04:28.720 --> 04:33.200
Young Theo, Decker, Peter, Jeffrey, Tommy Callahan,

04:33.200 --> 04:34.080
war with grandpa.

04:34.080 --> 04:36.160
He's playing Peter in Pete's Dragon and played Pete,

04:36.160 --> 04:38.880
so I don't know if we're continuing the Peter-verse.

04:38.880 --> 04:41.360
Maybe this is the verse that we're taking part in.

04:41.360 --> 04:44.080
Peter-verse, Focker-verse, crossover film.

04:44.640 --> 04:47.520
Do you guys see that Pete's Dragon movie, by the way?

04:47.520 --> 04:48.240
No.

04:48.240 --> 04:51.440
First 30 seconds, total party kill.

04:51.440 --> 04:54.480
They just like, aside from Pete, Pete lives,

04:54.480 --> 04:56.960
but they show you the car accident

04:56.960 --> 04:58.960
that takes away his parents.

04:58.960 --> 05:02.640
Okay, that's, it's a super cool Batman-esque move

05:02.640 --> 05:05.200
that shows you how Pete became the Dark Knight.

05:05.200 --> 05:06.320
That's unfortunate,

05:06.320 --> 05:08.480
but Pete's getting his revenge in this one

05:08.480 --> 05:10.480
because he's going to war with grandpa.

05:10.480 --> 05:12.560
Oh no, my parents died in a car accident.

05:12.560 --> 05:14.240
Now it's time to kill my grandpa.

05:14.240 --> 05:16.160
His parents are very much alive.

05:16.160 --> 05:17.760
Oh, it says a prequel.

05:19.600 --> 05:21.360
The second tagline of this one, it says

05:22.880 --> 05:24.400
old school versus new cool.

05:25.360 --> 05:28.080
Oh, fuck, baby, I got chills again, man.

05:28.080 --> 05:30.480
The war with grandpa, there's another-

05:31.120 --> 05:32.160
Needed two taglines.

05:32.160 --> 05:33.360
There's another tagline.

05:33.360 --> 05:35.760
Oh, I thought you were saying that was the second tagline too,

05:35.760 --> 05:38.240
as if to say like, did you hear that the first time?

05:38.240 --> 05:39.360
How good is this?

05:39.360 --> 05:42.720
The second tagline is a comedy for the whole family.

05:42.720 --> 05:43.280
Huh.

05:43.280 --> 05:44.880
Fucking good, yeah.

05:44.880 --> 05:46.080
Fucking good.

05:46.080 --> 05:48.320
And then the third tagline by Justin McElroy is

05:48.320 --> 05:51.280
fucking everybody's slumming it in this one

05:51.280 --> 05:53.600
because you've got Uma Thurman.

05:53.600 --> 05:54.320
Oh boy.

05:54.320 --> 05:55.840
Married to Rob Riggle.

05:55.840 --> 05:56.160
Oh boy.

05:56.160 --> 05:57.600
As the parents of Peter,

05:57.600 --> 06:00.320
who have given away Peter's room to Robert De Niro,

06:00.320 --> 06:01.440
the salty Ed.

06:03.040 --> 06:04.720
He's going to war.

06:05.600 --> 06:07.760
He's going to war with this kid.

06:07.760 --> 06:10.880
Man, for a second, I was kind of hoping that it was literal.

06:11.920 --> 06:14.800
It's starting to shape up like a Home Alone kind of war,

06:14.800 --> 06:17.040
where probably pranks and such.

06:17.040 --> 06:21.040
But I wanted it to be like maybe Robert De Niro's character

06:22.640 --> 06:25.200
was the dictator of one country and a young boy

06:25.200 --> 06:27.280
ascended to the throne of another country

06:27.280 --> 06:29.280
and he had to go to war with his own grandfather

06:29.280 --> 06:31.840
and it was a very touching Oscar-baped piece.

06:31.840 --> 06:33.440
Well, Dennis the Menace sort of-

06:34.560 --> 06:37.120
There's a super precedent established by Dennis the Menace

06:37.120 --> 06:40.800
who did perpetrate war crimes on poor old Walter Matthau,

06:40.800 --> 06:42.800
or at least an actor who looked a lot like Walter Matthau.

06:42.800 --> 06:43.840
No, it was Walter Matthau.

06:43.840 --> 06:45.200
And sometimes I think about that scene

06:45.200 --> 06:47.600
where he puts chiclets in as his fake front teeth.

06:47.600 --> 06:48.160
Yeah, that was briefly-

06:48.160 --> 06:49.440
I used to get really sad.

06:49.440 --> 06:50.560
That was briefly before he was elected.

06:50.560 --> 06:52.320
That's the new cool.

06:52.320 --> 06:53.360
That's the new cool.

06:53.360 --> 06:54.640
That's the super president.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.840
Walter Matthau was recently elected

06:59.840 --> 07:01.600
our nation's first super president.

07:02.320 --> 07:05.200
He is in charge of the other president and he is dead.

07:05.200 --> 07:06.800
Cheech Marin's in this one.

07:06.800 --> 07:07.280
Oh boy.

07:07.280 --> 07:10.240
Jane Seymour, Christopher Walken.

07:10.240 --> 07:13.520
Wow, they're not into making any other movies, huh?

07:13.520 --> 07:15.280
Is this the only movie they were making?

07:15.280 --> 07:17.200
I guess you get a call and you're like,

07:17.200 --> 07:19.440
I guess I'll be in the war with grandpa.

07:19.440 --> 07:20.160
Nice, dude.

07:20.160 --> 07:20.960
That's the script.

07:20.960 --> 07:21.680
Dude, that was fucking-

07:21.680 --> 07:25.040
My agent, is there any other movie?

07:25.040 --> 07:25.840
What is this?

07:25.840 --> 07:28.160
I could be in Cyborg.

07:28.160 --> 07:29.760
Oh, that was Jane Seymour, sorry.

07:29.760 --> 07:31.760
That sounds like, that was Jane Seymour.

07:31.760 --> 07:33.600
That sounds like a tape recorder

07:33.600 --> 07:35.520
that's being thrown down a flight of stairs.

07:36.480 --> 07:39.840
I am happy to take a roll.

07:40.400 --> 07:42.080
That was my impression of Torgue.

07:42.080 --> 07:44.480
I'm going to war with grandpa.

07:44.480 --> 07:46.160
So my problem-

07:46.160 --> 07:52.000
2,725 IMDB users have rated this film already.

07:52.000 --> 07:57.840
They are sitting at 5.3 in just their excitement

07:57.840 --> 08:01.840
or I guess pleasure that they've already derived

08:01.840 --> 08:04.800
from the promotional materials surrounding the war

08:04.800 --> 08:05.600
with grandpa.

08:05.600 --> 08:07.440
Is that fair to say?

08:07.440 --> 08:11.600
Yeah, I think, man, here's the thing,

08:11.600 --> 08:15.680
is that you've got De Niro, you've got Walken.

08:15.680 --> 08:17.440
This movie sounds like it's going to have

08:17.440 --> 08:19.600
a lot of sort of mature themes.

08:19.600 --> 08:21.840
These two fellows are always doing films

08:21.840 --> 08:22.880
with mature themes.

08:22.880 --> 08:26.000
So I'd love to take my family to this film,

08:26.000 --> 08:31.120
but I have no evidence to point me towards the conclusion

08:31.120 --> 08:33.840
that this film would be satisfactory for me

08:33.840 --> 08:35.280
to watch with my whole family.

08:35.280 --> 08:37.200
Yeah, I'm with Griffin on this one.

08:37.200 --> 08:38.960
It kind of seems like this might be fun

08:38.960 --> 08:42.640
for some of my family, like maybe the older kids

08:42.640 --> 08:44.480
or they're downplaying it

08:44.480 --> 08:46.880
and it's just good for the younger kids.

08:46.880 --> 08:49.600
What's amazing is I can actually break these ratings,

08:49.600 --> 08:51.440
IMDB ratings down by demographic.

08:52.080 --> 08:54.160
So if we zoom in, if we enhance here,

08:54.960 --> 08:57.760
kids under 18 are given this one a 6.3.

08:57.760 --> 09:02.240
Adults older than 45 are given it a 5.2.

09:02.240 --> 09:05.680
So the kids are saying, yes, I would like to go to war

09:05.680 --> 09:08.000
with grandpa and the grandparents are saying,

09:08.000 --> 09:09.920
actually, I would prefer that we not go to war.

09:09.920 --> 09:11.840
Well, they know, they know.

09:11.840 --> 09:14.960
Now, if I'm not mistaken, Justin, this is out of 10.

09:14.960 --> 09:18.320
So saying that 6.3 is I would like to go

09:18.320 --> 09:19.520
is awful generous.

09:19.520 --> 09:22.320
It's a sort of cautious, in theory,

09:22.320 --> 09:24.400
I would like to go to war with grandpa.

09:24.400 --> 09:28.080
It's as if to say, I'm afraid of what the other options

09:28.080 --> 09:28.480
might be.

09:29.120 --> 09:31.440
If this is the best one, then yes.

09:31.440 --> 09:34.400
But if there's something better, I would like to do that.

09:36.880 --> 09:37.840
This is the episode.

09:37.840 --> 09:40.560
Let's really get into the war with grandpa.

09:40.560 --> 09:42.960
It's called the war with grandpa,

09:42.960 --> 09:47.600
which seems to intimate a back and forth,

09:47.600 --> 09:51.200
a firing of, just looking at the trailer here,

09:51.200 --> 09:54.560
prank salvos that seem to escalate fairly quickly.

09:54.560 --> 09:57.600
Here's Robert De Niro putting foam sealant on his face

09:57.600 --> 09:58.560
instead of shaving cream.

09:58.560 --> 10:00.400
That would tear the man's flesh.

10:00.400 --> 10:02.080
That would rend the grandpa's flesh.

10:02.080 --> 10:03.440
That's an emergency room.

10:03.440 --> 10:05.120
That's an emergency room, for sure, for sure.

10:05.120 --> 10:08.240
Apparently, he sneaks a very big poisonous snake

10:08.240 --> 10:09.360
into his bed while he's sleeping.

10:09.360 --> 10:10.800
So now that's attempted murder.

10:11.920 --> 10:14.880
This film, it would be pretty fucking wild

10:14.880 --> 10:17.920
and also not suitable for me to bring my whole family to

10:17.920 --> 10:21.680
if the grandpa reciprocates even once.

10:22.800 --> 10:26.160
This is a war on grandpa.

10:26.160 --> 10:30.800
Grandpa is not going to pull out an aluminum baseball bat

10:30.800 --> 10:33.440
like now, my fucking turn.

10:33.440 --> 10:34.640
It's not gonna do it.

10:34.640 --> 10:36.960
He's just gonna take his licks, I guess.

10:36.960 --> 10:38.880
Now, here's the thing, though, Griffin.

10:38.880 --> 10:44.080
I would give an Oscar to a movie in which a child

10:44.080 --> 10:48.000
mercilessly pranks, and I'd say prank,

10:48.000 --> 10:50.720
with quotes around it, an old man,

10:50.720 --> 10:54.640
and those pranks include poisonous snakes and such.

10:54.640 --> 10:56.000
And the old man is just like,

10:56.000 --> 10:59.920
please, I just came for a visit because I love my family.

11:00.480 --> 11:02.800
I just wanted to spend time with my grandkid

11:02.800 --> 11:03.680
and get to know you.

11:03.680 --> 11:06.400
Why are you doing this?

11:06.400 --> 11:08.160
Maybe the title is actually not.

11:08.160 --> 11:11.600
Maybe the prank war is like the first five minutes

11:11.600 --> 11:14.960
and then seven minutes in, Oaks Vaguely gets drafted

11:14.960 --> 11:17.360
into the war with the robots.

11:17.360 --> 11:20.720
And he has to go to war with his grandpa.

11:22.000 --> 11:25.440
They're both conscripted into the battle against AI

11:26.000 --> 11:28.480
and he has to go to war with his grandpa also.

11:28.480 --> 11:31.040
Okay, here's my fanfic for the movie.

11:32.240 --> 11:34.960
Okay, the prank war,

11:34.960 --> 11:36.480
it's the first five minutes of the movie.

11:37.520 --> 11:39.120
And then grandpa says,

11:39.120 --> 11:41.840
this isn't the first war I've been in.

11:42.400 --> 11:45.120
And Oaks Vaguely says, what do you mean grandpa?

11:45.120 --> 11:47.600
And so then grandpa starts telling him about the great war

11:47.600 --> 11:51.120
that he fought in and Oaks Vaguely is there with him.

11:51.120 --> 11:54.000
We could fill that in with whatever war is like,

11:55.360 --> 11:56.560
we'll focus group that one.

11:56.560 --> 11:58.320
It's timeless.

11:58.320 --> 12:00.000
When we remake this movie.

12:00.000 --> 12:05.600
Yeah, and so then Oaks Vaguely is there with his grandfather

12:05.600 --> 12:07.840
as the grandfather is telling him the story

12:07.840 --> 12:09.840
and you see young grandpa,

12:09.840 --> 12:11.200
which is what we'll call the character

12:11.920 --> 12:13.520
and like his time in probably France.

12:14.160 --> 12:16.080
I mean, I just assuming France.

12:16.080 --> 12:18.560
When he's young grandpa, can we just call him dad?

12:20.480 --> 12:24.160
Yes, and he's drinking a lot of absinthe

12:24.160 --> 12:26.480
and then basically it just becomes like Moulin Rouge.

12:26.480 --> 12:28.400
And that it's fun for the whole family.

12:28.400 --> 12:30.640
That's where we get the family fun aspect.

12:30.640 --> 12:31.200
Right.

12:31.200 --> 12:33.120
I do see a clip in this trailer

12:33.120 --> 12:35.920
between the knocking him off a roof

12:35.920 --> 12:37.280
while he's dressed as Santa Claus

12:37.280 --> 12:38.880
and putting a poisonous snake in his bed

12:38.880 --> 12:41.200
where the grandpa and this grandson

12:41.200 --> 12:43.360
give a hug to each other.

12:43.360 --> 12:45.360
And I'm not sure where in the sequence of events

12:45.360 --> 12:46.400
that's gonna fit in,

12:46.400 --> 12:49.120
but it's fun for the family is here

12:49.120 --> 12:51.120
and it's new cool.

12:51.760 --> 12:54.160
Well, you have to imagine the movie ends

12:54.160 --> 12:55.840
with them reconciling, right?

12:55.840 --> 12:57.120
Or does it end with them like,

12:57.120 --> 12:59.040
I still fucking hate your guts.

12:59.040 --> 13:00.240
I don't know, man.

13:00.240 --> 13:04.800
This movie was finished and ready to be released

13:04.800 --> 13:06.880
February 23rd, 2018.

13:06.880 --> 13:08.880
Ooh, it had the mature in the bottle.

13:09.520 --> 13:11.520
Ooh, we gotta let this one age a little.

13:11.520 --> 13:13.360
Ooh, this one's a barrel-aged comedy.

13:13.360 --> 13:14.480
Get that oaky finish.

13:15.520 --> 13:16.800
It's got peaty notes.

13:16.800 --> 13:17.600
Oh wait, it does.

13:17.600 --> 13:19.840
It has Pete's dragon notes.

13:20.640 --> 13:23.440
I wish I could be there with Bob, Bobby,

13:23.440 --> 13:24.800
when he opens the newspaper

13:24.800 --> 13:27.200
and sees that big one sheet in variety

13:27.200 --> 13:29.120
and go see The War with Grandpa

13:29.120 --> 13:31.120
and he has to sit there and stare at it

13:31.120 --> 13:32.080
for five solid minutes.

13:32.080 --> 13:34.080
Wait, didn't I already put this movie out?

13:34.080 --> 13:36.640
And then he'll just quietly say to himself,

13:36.640 --> 13:38.560
there's no fucking way I did this movie.

13:38.560 --> 13:39.920
This does not seem right.

13:39.920 --> 13:42.160
Did they let me make three of these?

13:42.160 --> 13:43.600
How many of these movies I make?

13:44.160 --> 13:46.080
I told them that hologram Robert De Niro

13:46.080 --> 13:48.800
was to be used only in case of national emergency,

13:48.800 --> 13:50.640
not for films like The War with Grandpa.

13:50.640 --> 13:53.440
Oh no, I'm seeing here on IMDb in the trivia

13:54.000 --> 13:56.800
that this movie is made all, well,

13:56.800 --> 13:59.600
with deleted scenes from Cool Grandpa.

14:00.480 --> 14:04.880
Where, yeah, the Oaks Fegley was just reacting

14:04.880 --> 14:07.120
to footage that they already had.

14:07.120 --> 14:07.920
Right.

14:07.920 --> 14:08.560
Okay.

14:08.560 --> 14:10.000
Yeah, yep, yep, yeah.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.840
Oh, and a little bit, it says here,

14:11.840 --> 14:13.920
just a little bit of Baby Fockers.

14:13.920 --> 14:17.120
Just a touch.

14:17.120 --> 14:19.840
A drizzling of Baby Fockers, yeah.

14:19.840 --> 14:22.400
Yeah, he was in there just sort of

14:22.400 --> 14:24.720
Sky Captain in the World of Tomorrow-ing,

14:24.720 --> 14:26.480
just kind of pranking a tennis ball.

14:26.480 --> 14:31.840
But they put in De Niro using Adobe After Effects.

14:31.840 --> 14:32.000
Yeah.

14:32.880 --> 14:33.840
Anybody could do that.

14:33.840 --> 14:35.120
My kid could do that.

14:35.120 --> 14:37.520
And they had me do the ADR.

14:38.080 --> 14:39.520
They had Travis do the ADR.

14:39.520 --> 14:41.040
Travis, give me some, Travis, say like,

14:41.040 --> 14:44.000
you just threw, say like-

14:44.000 --> 14:47.840
Hey, hey, hey, is this a snake in my bed?

14:47.840 --> 14:48.960
Wait, there's a fucking,

14:48.960 --> 14:51.200
there's a fucking snake in my fucking bed?

14:52.000 --> 14:54.480
You little fucking piece of shit trying to kill me?

14:54.480 --> 14:57.440
Yeah, it says that in the script at least on GitHub.

14:57.440 --> 14:58.960
And can you read that one line that's like,

15:00.240 --> 15:02.800
you're gonna throw a beehive at my penis?

15:02.800 --> 15:03.520
Can you say that line?

15:03.520 --> 15:05.120
Yeah, you got it, yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:05.120 --> 15:07.040
You're gonna throw a fucking beehive at my penis?

15:07.040 --> 15:08.800
So the bees sting my balls?

15:08.800 --> 15:09.920
Do it PG-13.

15:09.920 --> 15:12.160
I love, Travis, I love the sting in the ball stuff.

15:12.160 --> 15:12.720
It's so funny.

15:12.720 --> 15:13.760
Okay, yeah, I'll work on it.

15:13.760 --> 15:16.480
Like this film is for the whole family.

15:16.480 --> 15:19.440
So we cannot actually show balls.

15:19.440 --> 15:21.040
I'll allude to it, okay?

15:21.040 --> 15:22.400
We wanna paint the image.

15:22.400 --> 15:24.160
So it's like a Pixar thing where like,

15:24.160 --> 15:26.640
you can say a dirty thing and then the parents will get it

15:26.640 --> 15:28.080
and think about like sexy stuff.

15:28.720 --> 15:29.440
Got it, got it, got it.

15:29.440 --> 15:30.240
Okay, let me try again.

15:30.240 --> 15:31.600
Try again, but don't curse on it.

15:31.600 --> 15:35.760
You're gonna throw a fudgin' beehive at my fudgin' genitals?

15:35.760 --> 15:39.280
So that they sting my old man testicles?

15:39.280 --> 15:40.720
No, that's a little too clinical.

15:40.720 --> 15:41.360
I just really want you to exercise.

15:41.360 --> 15:42.320
Okay, let me try again, can I try again?

15:42.320 --> 15:44.240
Just don't say fucking and don't say fudgin'.

15:44.240 --> 15:46.560
Let's, because this is gonna, this is real now.

15:46.560 --> 15:47.520
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

15:48.160 --> 15:51.120
What, you're going to throw that GD, is that okay?

15:52.080 --> 15:52.400
I just don't-

15:52.400 --> 15:54.480
Okay, yeah, I got it, I got it, I got it.

15:54.480 --> 15:57.120
You know what, go back to saying fucking and we'll fix it.

15:57.120 --> 15:57.620
Okay.

15:58.560 --> 16:01.040
What are you, fucking asshole?

16:01.040 --> 16:01.680
Is that better?

16:02.320 --> 16:03.440
No, okay, hold on.

16:03.440 --> 16:05.200
Hold on, but the line there that you gave,

16:05.200 --> 16:06.480
and that was an inspired read,

16:06.480 --> 16:08.400
is what are you, fucking asshole?

16:08.400 --> 16:08.720
And it's like-

16:08.720 --> 16:09.360
What are you?

16:09.920 --> 16:10.640
Okay, I left that out of it.

16:10.640 --> 16:11.920
It's incoherent, but at this point,

16:11.920 --> 16:14.720
his balls have been so stung so terribly by these hornets.

16:14.720 --> 16:18.800
Ah, these fucking bees are stinging my fucking old balls.

16:19.360 --> 16:25.040
And I'm here trying to flirt with this lady at this pool party,

16:25.040 --> 16:28.000
and you threw these fucking bees at me,

16:28.000 --> 16:30.400
and I'm going into anaphylactic shock.

16:30.400 --> 16:33.440
I can't breathe, and you took my EpiPen,

16:33.440 --> 16:35.520
and you smoked it like a vape,

16:35.520 --> 16:38.880
and now I'm dying because of my allergic reaction

16:38.880 --> 16:42.080
to these fucking bees stinging my fucking balls.

16:42.640 --> 16:44.960
Guys, the reviews are in on this fucking movie.

16:44.960 --> 16:48.400
The war with grandpa, everyone is talking about it.

16:48.400 --> 16:52.080
Somehow it has over 70 ratings on Google.

16:53.440 --> 16:55.120
Just to give you some of the highlights,

16:55.120 --> 16:57.680
here's a four-star review from Anthony.

16:57.680 --> 16:59.040
This is out of five, I should mention,

16:59.040 --> 17:00.560
so you're gonna like it a little bit more.

17:00.560 --> 17:02.480
One of the funnier movies I watch these days,

17:03.040 --> 17:05.600
reminiscent of the epic Home Alone series,

17:05.600 --> 17:07.840
I thoroughly enjoyed the gentle comedy,

17:07.840 --> 17:10.000
which I bet is fucking right on the money.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.560
Whoa, we've already established

17:12.560 --> 17:15.360
there's a scene with a snake in the bed.

17:15.360 --> 17:17.280
I thoroughly enjoyed the gentle comedy

17:17.280 --> 17:20.400
provoked by the war between a grandpa

17:20.400 --> 17:22.080
and sixth-grader grandson.

17:22.080 --> 17:26.720
There's enmity without malice and revenge without vengeance.

17:26.720 --> 17:28.800
I don't know why he became fucking William Faulkner,

17:28.800 --> 17:30.400
halfway through this review, but here we are.

17:30.960 --> 17:32.320
Lovely little family movie.

17:33.520 --> 17:37.920
If anyone ever referred to our jokes

17:37.920 --> 17:40.000
and the things that we do on these shows

17:40.000 --> 17:43.120
as gentle comedy, I feel like that would be

17:43.120 --> 17:45.440
a pretty huge letdown for me.

17:45.440 --> 17:49.760
I feel like, and I'm not saying we're, you know.

17:49.760 --> 17:50.320
Edgy.

17:50.320 --> 17:51.360
We're edgy.

17:51.360 --> 17:52.720
I don't think that that's true,

17:52.720 --> 17:54.320
although we did do an extended bit

17:54.320 --> 17:57.040
about throwing a beehive at Robert De Niro's

17:57.040 --> 17:59.600
reproductive organs.

17:59.600 --> 18:00.100
Genitals.

18:00.880 --> 18:03.520
I think we're just sort of normal comedy.

18:03.520 --> 18:06.240
I don't know what gentle comedy entails.

18:06.240 --> 18:07.840
He misspelled genital.

18:07.840 --> 18:10.800
Does that mean that it's just not funny?

18:10.800 --> 18:12.800
And it's like, is that what gentle comedy is?

18:12.800 --> 18:13.440
It's a thinker.

18:13.440 --> 18:16.000
It's funny, because Brad Barrage says,

18:16.000 --> 18:18.560
this movie was hilarious, loved it throughout,

18:18.560 --> 18:20.720
funny all the way, a total time killer.

18:23.040 --> 18:24.000
Hold on there.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.600
A great movie to watch with family

18:25.600 --> 18:26.800
and have a great time together.

18:26.800 --> 18:28.800
This movie will make you laugh a lot.

18:28.800 --> 18:31.200
A total family entertainer.

18:31.200 --> 18:31.360
Cool.

18:31.360 --> 18:36.320
Now, a TFE, a total family entertainer.

18:36.320 --> 18:37.520
Always looking for those.

18:37.520 --> 18:38.800
Now, here's what I will say.

18:38.800 --> 18:41.280
If someone was describing something I had made

18:42.080 --> 18:45.840
and they were like, oh, so funny, so wonderful,

18:46.480 --> 18:48.480
really killed some time,

18:48.480 --> 18:50.720
I think that that last one would take away

18:50.720 --> 18:52.080
from the first two.

18:52.080 --> 18:54.400
I'm just like, I liked the way that when I sat down

18:54.400 --> 18:56.800
to watch it, it was one time.

18:56.800 --> 18:58.560
And when I was finished watching it,

18:58.560 --> 18:59.840
it was a later time.

18:59.840 --> 19:01.200
And I enjoyed that.

19:01.200 --> 19:03.520
I enjoyed how time continued its linear flow.

19:05.120 --> 19:06.960
Here's one, a five star review.

19:07.680 --> 19:10.720
You hardly get to watch movies like that these days.

19:10.720 --> 19:12.000
Well, loved it.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.160
I had all the favorite casts there.

19:16.160 --> 19:17.680
Where are they watching this movie?

19:17.680 --> 19:18.400
Is it out?

19:18.400 --> 19:19.280
Can I watch it?

19:20.320 --> 19:21.200
I don't think so.

19:21.200 --> 19:23.600
How come they get to watch it?

19:25.760 --> 19:28.480
Here's one, it's three stars out of five.

19:29.920 --> 19:31.600
This is kind of the other side of the coin,

19:31.600 --> 19:33.280
which we've been very positive about

19:33.280 --> 19:33.840
War with Grandpa to this point.

19:33.840 --> 19:36.560
I don't want to hear any bad shit about War with Grandpa.

19:36.560 --> 19:38.080
Movie for kids only.

19:38.080 --> 19:39.040
Or maybe a family.

19:41.520 --> 19:42.880
Maybe a family of kids.

19:44.240 --> 19:45.920
Like a Camp Nowhere thing.

19:45.920 --> 19:47.760
You know, like the Herdman's from worst Christmas

19:47.760 --> 19:49.200
present ever, that kind of deal.

19:49.200 --> 19:49.680
You get it.

19:49.680 --> 19:50.560
I like it.

19:50.560 --> 19:53.520
Some good laughs and typical comedy performance.

19:53.520 --> 19:56.160
And damn, Robert De Niro is very old.

19:57.280 --> 19:58.080
Does this say that?

19:59.040 --> 20:02.000
Don't be ageist to Robert De Niro.

20:02.000 --> 20:06.400
Robert De Niro is very old, but still kicking.

20:06.400 --> 20:07.680
Still kicking ass?

20:07.680 --> 20:08.400
Or still like...

20:09.680 --> 20:12.240
There's that prolonged scene I'm watching on the trailer now

20:12.240 --> 20:15.680
where Robert De Niro just kicks that kid a lot.

20:15.680 --> 20:17.040
That's probably what he's referring to.

20:17.840 --> 20:20.000
Here's one, five star review.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.680
Five out of five stars.

20:21.680 --> 20:23.040
Greatest movie ever.

20:23.040 --> 20:24.800
It's actually a pretty good movie.

20:25.520 --> 20:28.400
Love the scenes between Grandpa and his grandchildren,

20:28.400 --> 20:30.800
which I would assume for what I've gathered

20:30.800 --> 20:33.200
has got to be the majority of the scenes, right?

20:34.480 --> 20:37.760
They were very sparing with the interactions

20:37.760 --> 20:40.080
betwixt Grandpa and grandson.

20:40.640 --> 20:42.480
They just sprinkled it in.

20:42.480 --> 20:45.360
This is just a total family entertainer.

20:45.360 --> 20:47.840
Just a total family entertainer.

20:47.840 --> 20:49.440
Angie says, I love this movie.

20:49.440 --> 20:51.680
Also, the characters are really pretty.

20:51.680 --> 20:52.180
Huh?

20:54.880 --> 20:56.400
All right, all right, all right.

20:58.640 --> 21:00.160
But not the actors, huh?

21:00.160 --> 21:01.360
The characters.

21:01.360 --> 21:01.760
Like their hearts?

21:01.760 --> 21:03.840
Maybe they have an inner beauty.

21:03.840 --> 21:06.080
I think that's maybe what we're talking about.

21:07.840 --> 21:11.440
You can see the twinkle in Oak Svegli's eye.

21:11.440 --> 21:14.080
Is that a first name or first and last, by the way?

21:14.080 --> 21:14.880
It's a symbol.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.320
I just want to go down the quick hit

21:18.320 --> 21:19.680
of all these other five-star reviews.

21:19.680 --> 21:22.160
Awesome movie after so long, especially in COVID.

21:28.240 --> 21:30.160
I like that one because it's like, listen,

21:30.160 --> 21:31.440
if the COVID shit hadn't happened,

21:31.440 --> 21:32.880
I probably would not be enjoying this flick.

21:32.880 --> 21:34.960
But right now, it's about all I can sew it.

21:34.960 --> 21:36.720
So yes, good on that front.

21:36.720 --> 21:37.920
Yes, good, gentle.

21:37.920 --> 21:40.720
It's like in the scene where it's just like,

21:40.720 --> 21:43.760
I've been crawling through the desert forever

21:43.760 --> 21:46.720
and I find like a stagnant pond and I'm so excited.

21:46.720 --> 21:47.600
You know what I mean?

21:47.600 --> 21:49.200
I wouldn't drink that day to day.

21:49.200 --> 21:52.960
It's not just me crawling through the desert, Travis.

21:53.520 --> 21:56.480
It's my whole fucking gosh dang family.

21:56.480 --> 21:56.880
Yeah.

21:56.880 --> 21:59.440
And then we find not one Oasis.

21:59.440 --> 22:00.320
Griffin's family of kids.

22:00.320 --> 22:02.480
Griffin's Fagan style family of kids.

22:02.480 --> 22:05.600
His little town style of kids.

22:05.600 --> 22:07.200
It is many Oasis.

22:07.200 --> 22:10.480
A total family entertainer, Travis.

22:10.480 --> 22:12.400
Like bring into noise, bring into funk.

22:12.400 --> 22:16.000
A total entertainment package like Blue Man Group, baby.

22:16.000 --> 22:19.360
And no one's upset by Blue Man Group, right?

22:20.000 --> 22:20.560
I can't.

22:20.560 --> 22:21.840
I mean, I don't know.

22:22.480 --> 22:23.120
Okay.

22:23.120 --> 22:24.320
We will find out.

22:27.680 --> 22:30.480
Hey, do you guys think Blue Man Group has done a zoom yet?

22:30.480 --> 22:32.000
Do you think they're doing private zooms?

22:32.000 --> 22:33.120
Probably just with each other.

22:33.760 --> 22:34.560
Excellent movie.

22:34.560 --> 22:35.520
Good, good, love it.

22:37.520 --> 22:39.280
That's like they got asked by Google

22:39.280 --> 22:41.440
as they were trying to get to work on time.

22:41.440 --> 22:43.200
Like Google's like, hey, real quick, real quick.

22:43.200 --> 22:43.760
What'd you think?

22:43.760 --> 22:44.960
All right, yeah, it was good.

22:44.960 --> 22:45.600
This is a good movie.

22:45.600 --> 22:46.100
Yeah, yeah.

22:48.400 --> 22:50.400
James Hare says, books butthole.

22:51.200 --> 22:51.840
Don't know what that means.

22:51.840 --> 22:53.760
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

22:53.760 --> 22:54.400
One more time?

22:55.120 --> 22:56.320
Books butthole.

22:57.680 --> 23:00.000
Wait, like this movie is a books butthole or?

23:00.000 --> 23:02.160
Let's explore that.

23:02.160 --> 23:04.880
Or maybe the book that, or with grandpa's based on.

23:05.680 --> 23:06.480
Grandpa's War.

23:07.840 --> 23:10.080
The last review here, five stars from three days ago.

23:11.600 --> 23:14.960
And this is, I, this is actually, it seems to sum it up.

23:14.960 --> 23:19.520
Good, but could be more, all caps, fun.

23:21.280 --> 23:25.920
Good, but could be more fun.

23:29.680 --> 23:33.760
I don't think it looks like it could be any more fun.

23:33.760 --> 23:35.920
Do you think grandpa dies in this movie?

23:35.920 --> 23:36.240
Yes.

23:36.240 --> 23:37.040
No, absolutely.

23:38.800 --> 23:41.920
Okay, see, I don't actually think so.

23:41.920 --> 23:42.960
Oh, interesting.

23:42.960 --> 23:45.520
No, I think it's like, I think it's like, I think this whole

23:45.520 --> 23:50.640
movie might just be a ploy to get people to be on better

23:50.640 --> 23:52.080
terms with their grandparents.

23:52.080 --> 23:55.120
And I think it's, I think it's that this boy just completely,

23:55.920 --> 24:00.800
just, just savages this, this older gentleman.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.800
And then not because of a prank, I'm not saying that the boy

24:04.800 --> 24:08.480
like pushes him off a ladder as he stresses Santa Claus and he

24:08.480 --> 24:10.000
falls, although he does do that.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.160
Or like he puts a poisonous snake in his bed and the snake

24:12.160 --> 24:13.760
bites him and he dies from that.

24:13.760 --> 24:16.720
Although he does do that also, unrelated thing.

24:16.720 --> 24:21.520
And then the boy's like, man, I should have been cooler to him.

24:21.520 --> 24:23.040
Here's what I think happens.

24:23.040 --> 24:23.680
Yeah, sure.

24:23.680 --> 24:25.760
All that prank stuff, everything we see in the trailer,

24:25.760 --> 24:27.440
that's the first five minutes.

24:27.440 --> 24:29.920
And then the grandfather gets bit by a snake and dies.

24:29.920 --> 24:34.000
And the boy is so sad that he goes to heaven to fight the

24:34.000 --> 24:37.600
angels to save, to bring back his grandfather's soul, much

24:37.600 --> 24:40.320
like, and it's been a while since I've seen it, but what I'm

24:40.320 --> 24:42.320
pretty sure happens in what dreams may come.

24:42.320 --> 24:44.400
It's what happens in what dreams may come is what happens

24:44.400 --> 24:45.920
in Dante's Inferno.

24:45.920 --> 24:48.320
It's what happens in the Poisonwood Bible.

24:48.320 --> 24:49.920
This movie is a movie.

24:50.480 --> 24:52.000
It's a total family entertainer.

24:52.000 --> 24:55.760
It's also a total literary omnibus.

24:56.480 --> 24:56.720
Yeah.

24:56.720 --> 25:00.800
The boy goes to war with God to bring back his grandfather's

25:00.800 --> 25:04.560
soul and it's fun for the whole family.

25:04.560 --> 25:06.480
Teams up with fucking Constantine.

25:06.480 --> 25:07.360
Yeah, baby.

25:07.360 --> 25:08.240
Fuck yes.

25:08.240 --> 25:08.880
Fuck yes.

25:08.880 --> 25:10.560
Oh God, yes.

25:11.360 --> 25:13.760
Oh, and maybe I like, maybe there's a fallen angel trying

25:13.760 --> 25:14.640
to get his wings back.

25:15.440 --> 25:16.240
It's a whole thing.

25:16.240 --> 25:18.480
Oh fuck, I'm excited for this movie, you guys.

25:18.480 --> 25:22.000
Guys, speaking of this movie, I don't want to like diminish

25:22.000 --> 25:24.720
because I think that things are often made more beautiful by

25:24.720 --> 25:27.440
their imperfections, but I did want to jump into some goof.

25:27.440 --> 25:27.920
Okay.

25:27.920 --> 25:28.800
Oh man.

25:28.800 --> 25:30.400
The internet, you know.

25:30.400 --> 25:30.800
Yeah.

25:30.800 --> 25:33.120
Sherlock's are already out at this one.

25:33.120 --> 25:34.880
Pick, pick, pick, pick, pick, pick, pick.

25:34.880 --> 25:36.400
Nitpick, pick, pick, pick.

25:36.400 --> 25:37.760
And I think, but you know what?

25:37.760 --> 25:39.120
You know what I like about these goofs though?

25:39.120 --> 25:40.160
What, Justin?

25:40.160 --> 25:43.680
Let's give me an early look at the war with grandpa because

25:43.680 --> 25:47.040
I'm getting a sneak peek into some of the scenes.

25:47.040 --> 25:47.360
Cool.

25:47.360 --> 25:52.240
Before me, a common American is able to watch and enjoy this.

25:52.240 --> 25:54.800
Oh, did they release this in like France?

25:55.360 --> 25:55.920
Perhaps.

25:55.920 --> 25:57.680
I mean, there's all these reviews and goofs.

25:59.040 --> 26:00.880
Let's see, we got a couple of character errors.

26:01.920 --> 26:05.040
Ed is told at Jerry's friend's funeral that he died in his

26:05.040 --> 26:06.640
sleep while skydiving.

26:06.640 --> 26:09.040
Well, this is a funny joke.

26:09.040 --> 26:12.160
In real life, all parachutes for sport jumping are equipped

26:12.160 --> 26:16.320
with an automatic activation device designed to activate

26:16.320 --> 26:18.320
the parachute to open if the user becomes unconscious or is

26:18.320 --> 26:20.720
otherwise unable to deploy the parachute when getting too

26:20.720 --> 26:21.200
close to the ground.

26:21.200 --> 26:22.320
Who wrote this?

26:22.320 --> 26:24.560
What stupid fucking idiot wrote this movie?

26:24.560 --> 26:24.720
Yeah.

26:25.440 --> 26:28.080
Can I, hey, can I point out a goof in that goof?

26:28.080 --> 26:28.560
Yeah.

26:28.560 --> 26:28.960
Yeah.

26:28.960 --> 26:30.000
Fucking goof.

26:30.000 --> 26:33.120
If he died in his sleep, he's dead before he hits the ground.

26:33.120 --> 26:34.960
It doesn't matter if the parachute goes off or not,

26:34.960 --> 26:35.600
you goof.

26:35.600 --> 26:37.600
Yeah, if he explodes into old jelly, then it's like-

26:37.600 --> 26:39.920
I'm saying he's dead before he hits the ground.

26:39.920 --> 26:40.400
Yeah.

26:40.400 --> 26:42.720
I would love to know how they did the analytics on that one.

26:42.720 --> 26:44.000
But yes, Travis, that's an excellent point.

26:44.000 --> 26:44.560
Can I say this?

26:44.560 --> 26:45.440
Can I say this, though?

26:45.440 --> 26:46.880
It is fucking funny.

26:47.520 --> 26:47.760
Right?

26:47.760 --> 26:48.880
It's funny.

26:48.880 --> 26:52.000
He died in his sleep while skydiving.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
Okay, this next one's good.

26:56.000 --> 26:59.840
Ed tells his, what is this fucking movie?

26:59.840 --> 27:02.880
Ed tells his granddaughter that, quote, pretty much every

27:02.880 --> 27:06.000
foundation I dug, I found a marble or two.

27:06.000 --> 27:09.600
And, quote, if you count all those marbles in the glass jar,

27:09.600 --> 27:11.120
you'll know how many houses I built.

27:12.080 --> 27:15.200
Pretty much implies he did not find a marble at the start of

27:15.200 --> 27:15.680
every house.

27:16.480 --> 27:20.240
And for the others, he found one or two, which means he found

27:20.240 --> 27:22.080
one, two, or more.

27:22.080 --> 27:26.240
Circumstances which would not give even a rough count of the

27:26.240 --> 27:28.960
number of houses he built, let alone an accurate one.

27:28.960 --> 27:34.640
I think the jury will find I don't want to pick holes in

27:34.640 --> 27:39.200
Mr. De Niro's film, but what the fuck?

27:39.200 --> 27:40.720
Why would there be marbles just...

27:43.280 --> 27:46.880
So this film opens with a different grandpa's funeral.

27:46.880 --> 27:50.160
So there's got to be a grandchild who goes-

27:50.160 --> 27:51.200
Who's won his war.

27:51.200 --> 27:54.160
Who's won his war, or at the very least experienced it, who

27:54.160 --> 27:57.360
goes to Pete's Dragon and he's like, don't you don't want to

27:57.360 --> 28:00.560
I'm telling you, I'm going to live with this weight, this

28:00.560 --> 28:03.280
guilt for the rest of my fucking days on this earth.

28:03.280 --> 28:04.800
Don't do it, Pete's Dragon.

28:04.800 --> 28:05.760
Oh, shit.

28:06.320 --> 28:07.760
Yeah, but he does it anyway.

28:07.760 --> 28:12.000
This movie is a backdoor sequel to Problem Childs.

28:12.000 --> 28:12.400
Yeah?

28:12.400 --> 28:12.640
Okay.

28:13.280 --> 28:16.640
That kid is like, I murdered my grandpa and it's great.

28:16.640 --> 28:19.120
I get all the like sweets and treats I want.

28:19.120 --> 28:21.680
Yeah, also inspired by the Poisonwood Bible.

28:22.560 --> 28:22.960
Are you sure?

28:24.080 --> 28:26.000
Got a couple of real quick plot holes.

28:26.000 --> 28:27.280
I'm skipping continuity.

28:27.280 --> 28:27.760
Okay.

28:27.760 --> 28:30.960
Ed demonstrates his ignorance of simple electronic devices,

28:30.960 --> 28:34.080
such as the self-checkout, an iPad, and a drone.

28:34.080 --> 28:38.080
If I can take a second just to kind of keep my sides from

28:38.080 --> 28:40.960
splitting, I just got to say that fucking sounds funny.

28:41.680 --> 28:45.360
Yet he somehow manages to log on to his grandson's presumably

28:45.360 --> 28:48.240
password protected computer, find the game his grandson has

28:48.240 --> 28:51.840
been playing, enter it, locate, and subsequently destroy the

28:51.840 --> 28:54.000
castle he has been building for three years.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.360
Oh, my God.

28:55.360 --> 28:56.720
I got to see this flick.

28:56.720 --> 28:57.440
That sounds great.

28:57.440 --> 28:58.160
I know, right?

28:58.160 --> 28:59.520
I got to see the seat.

28:59.520 --> 29:02.720
I just want one time in my life to see the old raging bull

29:02.720 --> 29:05.680
get in there and tear down some kid's Minecraft castle.

29:05.680 --> 29:06.880
That's where he's at now.

29:09.600 --> 29:10.880
Am I talking to you?

29:10.880 --> 29:12.000
Not while I'm gaming.

29:16.560 --> 29:18.640
Hey, can I eat all your redstone?

29:18.640 --> 29:20.640
I figured out a way to eat all your redstone.

29:20.640 --> 29:21.600
I ate it all.

29:21.600 --> 29:23.040
No more switches for you.

29:23.040 --> 29:27.760
I made your fortnight guy do the forbidden dances and got

29:27.760 --> 29:28.320
your band.

29:30.480 --> 29:31.840
Now I'm Twitch streaming.

29:33.040 --> 29:34.400
But that's just for me.

29:34.400 --> 29:36.240
That's not it's not part of the prank.

29:36.800 --> 29:38.000
And this is where I do.

29:38.000 --> 29:41.840
I think we should probably put a pin in the intro and move

29:41.840 --> 29:43.360
on with the show after this.

29:44.080 --> 29:45.200
But I have one more plot.

29:45.200 --> 29:46.400
Okay, great, great.

29:46.400 --> 29:49.680
And this may be actually getting into a little bit of

29:49.680 --> 29:52.560
a spoiler territory.

29:52.560 --> 29:54.480
So skip ahead about 10 minutes.

29:54.480 --> 29:56.080
Skip ahead 10 to 15 minutes.

29:56.960 --> 29:57.600
Make it 20.

29:59.600 --> 30:00.800
Just stop listening.

30:00.800 --> 30:01.760
Just stop listening.

30:01.760 --> 30:03.280
We're going to have the money zone soon.

30:03.280 --> 30:04.240
So don't actually skip.

30:04.880 --> 30:07.760
Okay, just start listening to it at like five times speed.

30:07.760 --> 30:10.400
Justin has to say that to keep the advertisers happy.

30:10.400 --> 30:12.720
But I want you to go into this film with fucking

30:13.280 --> 30:18.720
virgin ears and eyes and a heart and soul of a child's mind.

30:18.720 --> 30:22.000
So don't listen to this next fucking part, no matter what

30:22.000 --> 30:22.480
you do.

30:22.480 --> 30:23.120
It's cursed.

30:23.120 --> 30:25.680
I'm going to put a ring curse on this next 20 minutes.

30:25.680 --> 30:25.920
Nice.

30:26.560 --> 30:27.760
Don't interrupt me for a second.

30:27.760 --> 30:28.000
Okay.

30:28.640 --> 30:31.920
After the many accidents at the birthday party, Sally is

30:31.920 --> 30:36.480
angry with Ed for citing the war as being the cause of all

30:36.480 --> 30:38.160
the events that transpired.

30:38.160 --> 30:41.120
However, almost everything major that happened at that

30:41.120 --> 30:46.000
event, with the exception of the ejector seat chair, started

30:46.000 --> 30:49.440
as a direct result of a rat chewing through a cable and is

30:49.440 --> 30:51.360
not connected with the war at all.

30:51.920 --> 30:55.200
Therefore, not his nor his grandson's fault.

30:57.040 --> 30:59.440
This sounds like fun for the whole family.

30:59.440 --> 31:02.400
Sounds like a fucking total family entertainer is what it

31:02.400 --> 31:02.800
sounds like.

31:02.800 --> 31:06.640
There's a fucking rat chewing a cable that makes an ejector

31:06.640 --> 31:07.200
seat.

31:07.200 --> 31:08.000
Oh, fuck.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.160
You know, an ejector seat at a party.

31:10.720 --> 31:11.760
Fuck, that's funny.

31:12.560 --> 31:14.960
It's really funny and I'm kind of losing it.

31:14.960 --> 31:17.920
Old school versus new cool.

31:17.920 --> 31:20.400
Get it in theater.

31:20.400 --> 31:22.720
I still don't even want to joke and say that part.

31:22.720 --> 31:24.800
No, this one's coming.

31:24.800 --> 31:24.960
Yeah.

31:24.960 --> 31:28.320
So that's our first movie in the intro segment that was

31:28.320 --> 31:31.120
supposed to be one of many films we've talked about.

31:31.120 --> 31:32.880
The War with Grandpa is coming.

31:32.880 --> 31:34.000
Don't see it in theaters.

31:34.000 --> 31:35.840
It's going to be out October 9th, 2020.

31:35.840 --> 31:38.320
You know, you've waited two years to see this flick without

31:38.320 --> 31:39.040
knowing it.

31:39.040 --> 31:42.160
I think you could probably wait until it's out on a home

31:42.160 --> 31:42.960
viewing options.

31:42.960 --> 31:44.640
And that is our first ad.

31:44.640 --> 31:48.400
And now let's move on to some more ads in the money center.

31:59.360 --> 32:04.400
If you want to hire a family to watch War with Grandpa with

32:04.400 --> 32:07.040
you, you're going to need Zip Recruiter.

32:07.040 --> 32:08.480
I don't think Zip Recruiter will be a good fit.

32:08.480 --> 32:10.240
Yeah, let me just put a quick disclaimer here.

32:10.240 --> 32:13.600
I don't know that you can hire a family through Zip Recruiter.

32:14.160 --> 32:18.480
But if you could hire a family, Zip Recruiter would be the

32:18.480 --> 32:20.560
place to do it, right?

32:20.560 --> 32:22.160
Because it's hard to find the right person.

32:22.640 --> 32:25.600
And if it's hard for you, why not switch to Zip Recruiter?

32:25.600 --> 32:30.000
You can try it for free at ziprecruiter.com slash my

32:30.000 --> 32:30.480
brother.

32:31.040 --> 32:33.680
Zip Recruiter will send you the best candidates for the role

32:33.680 --> 32:37.040
you're looking for in around five minutes or so.

32:37.040 --> 32:39.680
And you can hire them the next day if you want to.

32:40.640 --> 32:43.200
And with the results like that, it's no wonder that four out

32:43.200 --> 32:46.080
of five employers who post in Zip Recruiter get a quality

32:46.080 --> 32:48.640
candidate within the first day.

32:49.360 --> 32:50.880
And right now you can try it for free.

32:50.880 --> 32:54.640
That's right, free at ziprecruiter.com slash my

32:54.640 --> 32:55.200
brother.

32:55.200 --> 32:59.600
That's ziprecruiter.com slash my brother.

33:00.640 --> 33:03.200
So let's say you're watching the War with Grandpa and you're

33:03.200 --> 33:05.520
seeing the iconic scene of the war.

33:05.520 --> 33:09.280
And you're seeing the iconic scene where Robert De Niro,

33:09.280 --> 33:10.320
Ed, as we know-

33:10.320 --> 33:10.960
Salty Ed.

33:11.600 --> 33:16.240
Salty Ed is in his fucking cardigan and cabby cap and-

33:16.240 --> 33:18.080
Looking so choice.

33:18.080 --> 33:18.880
He looks fucking good.

33:18.880 --> 33:19.520
He looks cool.

33:20.080 --> 33:20.880
He looks cool.

33:20.880 --> 33:22.080
He looks sexy.

33:22.080 --> 33:24.000

the course of an hour because that's what we do every week on

35:04.800 --> 35:07.440
story break a writer's room podcast where three Hollywood

35:07.440 --> 35:10.080
professionals have an hour to come up with a pitch for a movie

35:10.080 --> 35:13.200
or TV show based off of totally zany prompts like that time we

35:13.200 --> 35:16.160
reimagine Star Wars based on our phones auto complete Luke

35:16.160 --> 35:19.840
Skywalker is a family man and it's Star Wars, but it's a good

35:19.840 --> 35:20.340
idea.

35:20.400 --> 35:22.640
How about a time we broke the story of a bunch of Disney

35:22.640 --> 35:25.120
channel original movies based solely on the title and the

35:25.120 --> 35:25.620
poster.

35:25.680 --> 35:27.040
Okay, Sarah Hyland is a 50 foot woman.

35:27.040 --> 35:28.000
Let's just go with it guys.

35:28.000 --> 35:30.560
Or the time we finally cracked the Adobe Photoshop feature

35:30.560 --> 35:34.480
film stamp tool is your woody and then the autofill is the

35:34.480 --> 35:36.960
new Buzz Lightyear join us as we have a good time

35:36.960 --> 35:39.600
imagining all the movies Hollywood is too cowardly to

35:39.600 --> 35:42.560
make story break comes out every Thursday on maximum fun.

35:42.560 --> 35:43.920
I don't know why I'm using this voice now.

35:45.120 --> 35:46.080
Question or Yahoo.

35:46.720 --> 35:50.720
Well here I feel I feel like we need to I have to make an

35:50.720 --> 35:53.680
apology and maybe you guys can join in too because I feel like

35:53.680 --> 35:56.320
we've been talking a lot about we've been talking a lot about

35:56.320 --> 35:58.720
we've been talking a lot about wars grandpa, but we've been

35:58.720 --> 36:00.480
talking a lot about how it's fun for the whole family.

36:01.200 --> 36:03.600
Yeah, and I feel like we should clarify like that includes

36:03.600 --> 36:04.480
found family.

36:04.480 --> 36:05.120
You know what I mean?

36:05.120 --> 36:07.760
Because not everybody has a good relationship.

36:07.760 --> 36:10.160
Maybe your grandpa is more of like a Dr.

36:10.160 --> 36:13.600
Brown scenario where you have like a found grandpa you want

36:13.600 --> 36:17.120
to go to war with and I just want to make it clear that like

36:17.120 --> 36:20.160
I think it's fun for the whole found family as well.

36:20.160 --> 36:22.480
I just don't want you know, you're sitting there with maybe

36:22.480 --> 36:27.520
it's your roommates or yeah, you know like your coven or like

36:27.520 --> 36:29.600
you know, just your high school friends who you're still really

36:29.600 --> 36:31.680
tight with and you talk about how good you did in the big

36:31.680 --> 36:34.240
game like no matter who it is, right?

36:34.240 --> 36:40.880
I think every literally everyone will enjoy watching war

36:40.880 --> 36:41.360
with grandpa.

36:41.360 --> 36:43.280
I think that this movie is really going to bring people

36:43.280 --> 36:45.680
back together after we've been pulled apart by covid.

36:46.240 --> 36:48.720
Yeah, that's actually a great point Travis.

36:48.720 --> 36:50.960
You got to remember that when you're watching war with

36:50.960 --> 36:53.280
grandpa at your house, you're actually watching with

36:53.280 --> 36:55.760
everybody else on planet earth that is also enjoying this

36:55.760 --> 36:59.360
film and that's something you can't you can't get for free.

36:59.360 --> 36:59.920
Yeah.

36:59.920 --> 37:00.160
Yeah.

37:00.160 --> 37:03.920
I mean everybody's everybody came from the same sort of

37:05.120 --> 37:06.160
Adam and Eve.

37:06.160 --> 37:07.680
We're all family if you think about it.

37:08.640 --> 37:09.280
Yep.

37:09.280 --> 37:10.560
That's so true.

37:11.760 --> 37:13.200
That's so true.

37:13.200 --> 37:14.640
We all came up out of Abraham.

37:14.640 --> 37:17.120
So we got it's all we're all family.

37:17.120 --> 37:18.480
All came up.

37:18.480 --> 37:19.280
Yep.

37:19.280 --> 37:19.680
Thank you.

37:19.680 --> 37:20.640
Thank you.

37:20.640 --> 37:24.000
And you know, I think maybe we should do like a widely

37:24.000 --> 37:24.560
synchronized now.

37:24.560 --> 37:25.360
I'm not saying me.

37:25.360 --> 37:26.080
I'm saying the world.

37:26.080 --> 37:31.200
This is a wide the whole world should just all watch war

37:31.200 --> 37:33.120
with grandpa at the exact same time.

37:33.120 --> 37:34.240
I think that could be cool.

37:34.240 --> 37:39.360
I think that could be like to buy the world a limited time

37:39.360 --> 37:43.600
streaming copy of war with grandpa for them to enjoy and

37:43.600 --> 37:44.880
then we'd all be united.

37:44.880 --> 37:45.120
Yeah.

37:45.120 --> 37:48.560
And here's here's like can I put like a little cool spin on

37:48.560 --> 37:51.200
it? Yeah, we're not going to schedule that time.

37:51.200 --> 37:53.120
I want everyone to just feel it.

37:53.120 --> 37:55.520
I want them to feel it like there will come a moment where

37:55.520 --> 37:57.440
you're like this is it and you're right.

37:57.440 --> 38:00.800
It's everybody will just we'll all sync up and it might be

38:00.800 --> 38:02.880
now it might be 10 years from now.

38:02.880 --> 38:06.640
But like we want there will come a moment where all of our

38:06.640 --> 38:10.720
breeding patterns and our heartbeats and yes, our periods

38:10.720 --> 38:15.600
will all sync up and we'll just know it's the time to watch

38:16.160 --> 38:17.040
war with grandpa.

38:17.040 --> 38:21.840
Well, I mean it'll also have the title song war with grandpa

38:21.840 --> 38:24.800
that chance the rapper did for the soundtrack of war with

38:24.800 --> 38:25.360
grandpa.

38:25.360 --> 38:28.720
So maybe we'll just like play like you'll just you're just

38:28.720 --> 38:34.560
going to hear it and not from any kind of a radio or CD

38:34.560 --> 38:35.280
player.

38:35.280 --> 38:37.840
No, you're just going to it's just going to be you're just

38:37.840 --> 38:40.560
going to hear it and you'll know that it's time to race to

38:40.560 --> 38:46.960
the Blu-ray player and or sorry streaming your wrote your Roku

38:47.680 --> 38:53.280
and or your Goku on your Goku to watch this film or however

38:53.280 --> 38:54.560
we're watching movies at that point.

38:54.560 --> 38:57.600
Because like I said, it might be a long time from now.

38:57.600 --> 38:58.640
Am I reading this right?

38:58.640 --> 39:00.640
This movie's four and a half hours long.

39:04.400 --> 39:05.760
How could that possibly be?

39:07.520 --> 39:10.400
Not nothing was left on the cutting room for it's all on

39:10.400 --> 39:15.040
screen and I mean including like where they would cut and

39:15.040 --> 39:17.600
like reset and make film scenes again.

39:17.600 --> 39:20.080
They didn't edit anything out.

39:20.080 --> 39:22.400
They made it kind of like boyhood where they've been

39:22.400 --> 39:27.280
shooting this movie since Oaks Fagley was born and he's

39:27.280 --> 39:28.240
26 now.

39:30.400 --> 39:32.960
I would love to talk about Tim Hill.

39:32.960 --> 39:35.520
Oh, the I hate I want to pivot a little bit really thought

39:35.520 --> 39:36.800
we were about to do a question.

39:37.440 --> 39:37.760
No.

39:37.760 --> 39:38.080
Yeah.

39:38.080 --> 39:39.760
No, I just want to get this one last thing.

39:39.760 --> 39:44.000
Yeah, we'll get to the episode super quick.

39:44.000 --> 39:46.160
I want to start the episode very soon.

39:46.160 --> 39:48.640
I did want to hit this one last thing about Tim Hill and

39:48.640 --> 39:49.600
just go through his now.

39:49.600 --> 39:50.240
Who is that?

39:51.200 --> 39:54.800
Like he's the director of a film called The War with

39:54.800 --> 39:54.960
Crime.

39:54.960 --> 39:56.080
Oh, right, right, right, right.

39:56.080 --> 39:56.720
Of course.

39:56.720 --> 39:57.120
Yeah.

39:57.120 --> 40:01.040
So let's pretend we're doing like a maybe this is like our

40:01.040 --> 40:03.200
neck if we're if we're a blank check.

40:03.200 --> 40:06.000
Yeah, we're doing like our blank check mini series.

40:06.000 --> 40:09.200
Here are the films we be enjoying in this series Muppets

40:09.200 --> 40:10.000
from Space.

40:10.000 --> 40:11.440
Wait, sorry Justin before you continue.

40:11.440 --> 40:13.680
Are you going chronologically back to front or front to

40:13.680 --> 40:14.960
back back front?

40:14.960 --> 40:15.360
Okay.

40:15.360 --> 40:18.000
Muppets from Space, Max Keeble's Big Move.

40:18.000 --> 40:18.880
Oh, great.

40:18.880 --> 40:19.600
Good one.

40:19.600 --> 40:20.080
Fun flick.

40:20.080 --> 40:23.760
The SpongeBob SquarePants movie he did not direct so we can

40:23.760 --> 40:24.560
skip that one.

40:24.560 --> 40:26.880
Unfortunately, the one of these that I would have wanted to

40:26.880 --> 40:27.120
watch.

40:27.120 --> 40:28.320
Fuck, you don't want to watch Max Keeble's Big Move?

40:28.320 --> 40:30.640
Max Keeble rips ass, dude.

40:30.640 --> 40:32.240
Max Keeble is a fine film.

40:32.240 --> 40:34.480
Tears it up every viewing.

40:34.480 --> 40:40.160
I've worn out the spindles on my VHS of Max Keeble's.

40:40.160 --> 40:41.360
Here's the right here.

40:41.360 --> 40:44.960
Okay, so then he's got Garfield Tale of Two Kitties.

40:44.960 --> 40:45.520
Oh, wow.

40:45.520 --> 40:45.920
All right.

40:46.800 --> 40:48.000
Oscar win.

40:48.000 --> 40:49.200
And then Alvin and the Chipmunks.

40:49.200 --> 40:49.600
All right.

40:50.960 --> 40:52.080
And then Hop.

40:53.040 --> 40:53.440
Huh?

40:53.440 --> 40:54.320
If you remember that one.

40:54.320 --> 40:54.800
Sure.

40:55.360 --> 40:59.200
Russell Brand is a cute little bunny firing on all cylinders.

40:59.200 --> 41:01.360
Then Grumpy Cat's Worst Christmas Ever.

41:01.360 --> 41:01.600
Whoa.

41:01.600 --> 41:03.200
Whoa.

41:03.200 --> 41:05.280
And then for six years, nothing.

41:05.280 --> 41:06.000
Huh.

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
Well, once you nail it, you know what I mean?

41:08.720 --> 41:09.040
Yeah.

41:09.040 --> 41:14.000
And then in 2020, he's got both the SpongeBob Movie

41:14.000 --> 41:17.280
Sponge on the Run and The War with Grandpa.

41:17.280 --> 41:18.480
So Tim Hill is back.

41:18.480 --> 41:19.920
He's on fucking fire.

41:19.920 --> 41:24.480
Can I say, okay, J-Man, when you started his filmography,

41:24.480 --> 41:28.880
I was not expecting this laundry list of certified hits.

41:28.880 --> 41:29.360
Yeah.

41:29.360 --> 41:31.440
Huge hits, all bad.

41:31.440 --> 41:31.920
Huge hits, though.

41:31.920 --> 41:34.000
But all recognizable, though, which-

41:34.000 --> 41:35.280
Recognizable hits.

41:35.280 --> 41:37.520
There's been one thread tying to-

41:37.520 --> 41:41.760
I feel like we have probably talked about Tim Hill's movies

41:41.760 --> 41:47.760
on this podcast more than a lot of huge directors.

41:48.720 --> 41:51.280
We have definitely, definitely talked about

41:51.280 --> 41:53.040
Garfield Tale of Two Kitties.

41:53.040 --> 41:57.120
Oh, I'm almost certain that it also inspired an episode-long

41:57.120 --> 41:59.920
fever dream like the one we currently find ourselves

41:59.920 --> 42:00.560
embroiled in.

42:00.560 --> 42:02.720
This is just the intro, we'll get to the episode.

42:02.720 --> 42:03.680
We're going to get to the-

42:03.680 --> 42:05.760
I'm saying that sometimes you get these

42:05.760 --> 42:10.400
and it's like College Bobsled 3 or whatever,

42:10.400 --> 42:11.200
and you're like, what?

42:11.200 --> 42:12.000
Who is this person?

42:12.000 --> 42:15.120
But Tim Hill has had a storied career.

42:15.840 --> 42:18.240
Tim Hill has also done some amazing work on TV.

42:18.880 --> 42:23.120
Welcome Freshman, Rocko's Modern Life, Bobby's World,

42:23.120 --> 42:28.240
Ka-Blam, Action League Now, don't mind if I fucking do.

42:28.240 --> 42:30.400
Is War with Grandpa really good?

42:30.400 --> 42:30.960
Is it kind of-

42:30.960 --> 42:33.440
What if War with Grandpa fucking rips ass?

42:33.440 --> 42:36.160
Rips ass right alongside Max Cable's.

42:37.520 --> 42:38.720
I'm saying.

42:38.720 --> 42:43.360
We're going to look so smart when this movie fucking rips ass.

42:43.360 --> 42:46.800
This- you have convinced me, I am-

42:46.800 --> 42:49.440
I feel comfortable being swept away in the-

42:49.440 --> 42:50.240
Sorry, what?

42:50.240 --> 42:50.560
Sorry, stop.

42:50.560 --> 42:52.720
I don't think I could say it like that again if I tried.

42:52.720 --> 42:53.680
Say it again.

42:53.680 --> 42:54.160
Just like that, baby.

42:54.160 --> 42:55.200
Comfortable.

42:55.200 --> 42:55.600
Comfortable.

42:55.600 --> 42:56.640
Comfortable.

42:56.640 --> 42:57.200
Comfortable.

42:57.200 --> 42:58.400
Comfortable.

42:58.400 --> 43:01.840
I'm comfortable in the arms of Tim Hill.

43:02.640 --> 43:04.400
To Tim Hill, comfortable.

43:04.400 --> 43:06.400
To tear me away to Tim Hill.

43:11.760 --> 43:13.280
Where does he go from here?

43:13.280 --> 43:14.720
The grandpa's been bad.

43:14.720 --> 43:16.560
We've gone to war with him.

43:16.560 --> 43:18.160
He's got to be reborn.

43:18.160 --> 43:20.320
The next thing should just be Love Grandpa.

43:20.320 --> 43:22.320
Grandpa struggles in peacetime.

43:22.320 --> 43:24.560
No, the next one's just going to be Love Grandpa,

43:24.560 --> 43:26.320
and people are going to see that and be like,

43:26.320 --> 43:29.440
Love Grandpa, that sounds a little gross for me.

43:29.440 --> 43:33.200
And then Tim's going to have to go on a sort of door-to-door

43:33.200 --> 43:35.040
grassroots marketing campaign and be like,

43:35.040 --> 43:38.720
no, you pronounce it Love Grandpa, like a command.

43:39.280 --> 43:41.680
Oh, I thought it was like love actually.

43:41.680 --> 43:42.880
No, Love Grandpa.

43:43.920 --> 43:44.800
Love Grandpa.

43:45.840 --> 43:47.280
You must love Grandpa.

43:48.080 --> 43:49.600
You have seen him be bad.

43:50.160 --> 43:51.600
You have seen him be dirty.

43:52.160 --> 43:54.480
You have seen him at war.

43:54.480 --> 43:57.120
Now you must love Grandpa.

43:57.120 --> 43:58.640
You must love Grandpa.

44:00.160 --> 44:03.280
Can we real quick, I hate to do this on the show,

44:03.280 --> 44:07.840
but real quick, can we just enjoy together the trailer

44:07.840 --> 44:08.880
for War with Grandpa?

44:08.880 --> 44:11.200
Is that like a good use of our time?

44:11.200 --> 44:13.200
Okay, give me just one second to get it kind of

44:15.360 --> 44:16.240
spooled up here.

44:16.880 --> 44:19.760
I'm going to do a little Bluetooth pairing.

44:20.880 --> 44:23.360
Imagine while I'm doing this,

44:23.360 --> 44:27.600
what if I was Ed from War with Grandpa?

44:27.600 --> 44:28.880
You wouldn't be able to figure it out.

44:28.880 --> 44:29.680
You couldn't do it.

44:29.680 --> 44:30.720
I was trying to do this.

44:30.720 --> 44:32.080
Can you fucking imagine?

44:33.040 --> 44:34.080
You'd be losing it.

44:35.280 --> 44:36.560
You'd be absolutely losing it.

44:36.560 --> 44:37.600
I'm already losing it.

44:37.600 --> 44:38.880
Just picturing it.

44:38.880 --> 44:40.320
I'm losing it thinking about it.

44:40.320 --> 44:41.440
Yeah, it's really funny.

44:41.440 --> 44:44.480
Gotta say, Juice, it is taking you about as long as it would

44:44.480 --> 44:46.080
take Salty Ed to figure it out.

44:48.800 --> 44:52.400
I haven't seen him even thinking about that.

44:52.400 --> 44:53.200
Yeah, right?

44:53.200 --> 44:56.320
Even thinking about that is fucking busting me off.

44:56.320 --> 44:57.920
It's kind of bringing us all together.

44:57.920 --> 44:59.760
Our whole family so far loves it.

44:59.760 --> 45:02.320
It really is a total family entertainer.

45:02.320 --> 45:06.240
War with Grandpa.

45:08.480 --> 45:12.000
This one's got 4.7 million views.

45:12.000 --> 45:14.720
More views than any we've ever gotten in our entire lives.

45:14.720 --> 45:15.280
No, it's okay.

45:17.680 --> 45:18.400
Let's do this.

45:18.400 --> 45:22.480
This is the War with Grandpa official trailer.

45:24.000 --> 45:25.360
He's in a grocery store.

45:25.360 --> 45:26.480
Can I help you, sir?

45:26.480 --> 45:28.000
You can help me find Maria.

45:28.000 --> 45:29.120
All Maria's gone.

45:29.120 --> 45:30.800
We're completely self-checkout now.

45:30.800 --> 45:32.240
Please scan your item.

45:32.240 --> 45:33.840
Please scan your item.

45:33.840 --> 45:34.560
I just did.

45:34.560 --> 45:35.760
Please scan your item.

45:36.880 --> 45:37.600
Then he leaves.

45:37.600 --> 45:38.320
He gets arrested.

45:39.120 --> 45:40.560
This can't keep happening.

45:41.280 --> 45:42.160
He hits a mailbox.

45:42.160 --> 45:43.760
You're not putting me in a home.

45:43.760 --> 45:45.360
What if it were our home?

45:45.360 --> 45:46.000
Oh my god.

45:46.000 --> 45:46.500
Grandpa!

45:46.500 --> 45:47.680
Jenny!

45:47.680 --> 45:48.560
Hi, Grandpa.

45:48.560 --> 45:49.520
Hello, sweetheart.

45:50.720 --> 45:52.160
How's your daughter's place at?

45:52.160 --> 45:53.680
She gave me my grandson's room.

45:53.680 --> 45:54.160
That's great.

45:54.160 --> 45:54.880
You're welcome.

45:54.880 --> 45:55.760
How do you like your room?

45:55.760 --> 45:56.320
Kid, look.

45:56.320 --> 45:58.400
I didn't want it to be this way either.

45:58.400 --> 45:59.760
I just want my room back.

46:00.960 --> 46:01.440
Jesus.

46:02.000 --> 46:02.960
The kid runs into a...

46:04.400 --> 46:05.360
I want to put up with this.

46:05.360 --> 46:05.920
A little hanging.

46:05.920 --> 46:08.080
I didn't have my room back or else it's war.

46:08.960 --> 46:10.560
Declaration of war.

46:10.560 --> 46:13.760
Give me back what is mine or face the consequences.

46:14.480 --> 46:14.980
Okay.

46:15.520 --> 46:16.020
Okay.

46:16.020 --> 46:16.520
Okay.

46:17.380 --> 46:18.500
You got your wish.

46:18.500 --> 46:19.700
It's got a power drill.

46:19.700 --> 46:21.540
Last drying foam sealant.

46:21.540 --> 46:22.500
I'm gonna get this kid.

46:23.060 --> 46:24.740
This shirt was off in that scene.

46:24.740 --> 46:26.660
You want me to help you and your buddies.

46:26.660 --> 46:28.900
To help beat up your grandson and his buddies

46:28.900 --> 46:31.460
because the two of you can't figure out some way to live in the same place.

46:31.460 --> 46:31.960
Funny.

46:32.820 --> 46:34.500
Well, when you put it like that...

46:34.500 --> 46:35.460
I'm in.

46:35.460 --> 46:35.940
What?

46:35.940 --> 46:36.340
What?

46:36.340 --> 46:37.140
What?

46:37.140 --> 46:40.340
This kind of aggression shall not stand sympathize.

46:40.340 --> 46:41.540
I didn't know you were a marine.

46:41.540 --> 46:42.100
Oh my god.

46:42.100 --> 46:44.180
It's because we're walking on a hoverboard.

46:44.180 --> 46:44.740
Just saying.

46:44.740 --> 46:46.340
It ain't enough.

46:46.340 --> 46:47.060
Let's do this.

46:48.740 --> 46:50.500
Do you even remember how to do this?

46:50.500 --> 46:51.540
So you don't need your diaper.

46:52.900 --> 46:54.340
Your shit's blowing up, Justin.

46:59.220 --> 47:00.260
They're playing dodgeball.

47:02.340 --> 47:03.620
Why are we doing it this way?

47:03.620 --> 47:06.900
When you have peace talks, you need someone neutral to mediate.

47:06.900 --> 47:08.180
He gave me a cookie.

47:08.180 --> 47:09.700
It is true, a cookie was given.

47:10.420 --> 47:10.980
That is funny.

47:10.980 --> 47:11.300
That's good.

47:11.300 --> 47:12.020
Yeah.

47:12.020 --> 47:13.140
That actually is pretty funny.

47:13.140 --> 47:14.900
That is funny.

47:14.900 --> 47:16.900
I think your grandpa might be a ninja.

47:16.900 --> 47:18.020
We gotta end this somehow.

47:19.780 --> 47:21.780
He's falling off on a ladder onto a bouncy castle.

47:21.780 --> 47:22.900
It's dead.

47:22.900 --> 47:24.260
Did you see that?

47:24.260 --> 47:25.860
She said he's dead.

47:25.860 --> 47:27.220
It was Chris for walking towards the sand.

47:27.220 --> 47:27.860
It's gonna be cool.

47:27.860 --> 47:28.100
Okay.

47:28.100 --> 47:28.900
It's so fucking good.

47:28.900 --> 47:29.700
And then here comes the...

47:30.740 --> 47:31.380
And there's a snake.

47:31.380 --> 47:32.420
Yeah, it's like a godfather thing.

47:33.220 --> 47:34.980
It's like a kind of a godfather thing.

47:34.980 --> 47:35.620
It's fucking great.

47:35.620 --> 47:38.740
So that is War with Grandpa coming to theaters.

47:38.740 --> 47:39.540
What did we say?

47:39.540 --> 47:40.500
Let's probably not theaters.

47:40.500 --> 47:41.060
October.

47:41.060 --> 47:41.540
Oh, no.

47:41.540 --> 47:42.420
Sorry.

47:42.420 --> 47:45.060
Sorry, only in theaters.

47:45.060 --> 47:47.860
So don't even try to see this one.

47:47.860 --> 47:48.580
That is gonna be...

47:49.140 --> 47:52.500
I have been very good about this whole quarantine thing.

47:53.140 --> 47:58.500
That is gonna be sort of an incredible rigid hell for me.

47:58.500 --> 47:59.940
Too tempting.

47:59.940 --> 48:03.140
Yeah, too tempting that people are out there loving this movie,

48:03.140 --> 48:05.700
enjoying this movie, the War with Grandpa.

48:05.700 --> 48:06.980
Please no spoilers.

48:06.980 --> 48:10.500
Now listen, there was a moment in that movie, if I'm not mistaken,

48:10.500 --> 48:13.700
and granted it was playing clearly through Justin's phone,

48:15.140 --> 48:22.340
where Jane Seymour, who is the Maria, I believe,

48:22.340 --> 48:23.700
is the Maria that he is asking for at the beginning of the grocery store.

48:23.700 --> 48:26.580
Okay, Justin's putting the pieces together.

48:26.580 --> 48:28.020
She works at the grocery store.

48:28.020 --> 48:29.460
She works at the grocery store.

48:29.460 --> 48:32.020
She, and she, they probably will.

48:32.020 --> 48:32.340
Yes.

48:32.340 --> 48:32.580
Okay.

48:33.860 --> 48:36.980
And she, is she Pete's mom?

48:37.700 --> 48:38.100
No.

48:38.100 --> 48:38.340
No.

48:38.340 --> 48:40.820
Uma Thurman is Pete's mom.

48:40.820 --> 48:41.300
Yeah.

48:41.300 --> 48:43.140
Okay, see, this is why I was confused.

48:43.140 --> 48:47.060
Maria is his sexual partner.

48:47.060 --> 48:49.860
Yeah, no, they're gonna pork for sure.

48:49.860 --> 48:56.740
Uma Thurman, I imagine, has no knowledge of this conflict.

48:56.740 --> 48:57.620
That's why I was confused,

48:57.620 --> 49:00.100
because it did sound as though the mother character was like,

49:00.100 --> 49:01.540
yeah, let's beat up my son.

49:01.540 --> 49:08.420
No, no, it's, no, it is, I guess it is Salty Ed's lover.

49:08.420 --> 49:10.420
Yes, so they're going to beat up a child

49:10.420 --> 49:11.140
as like an aphrodisiac.

49:11.140 --> 49:12.980
They're gonna try to kick ass.

49:12.980 --> 49:14.580
And Jane Seymour says it.

49:14.580 --> 49:17.220
She doesn't even, she's not joking.

49:17.220 --> 49:18.980
Yeah, she says that, yeah.

49:18.980 --> 49:20.020
Let's beat up some fucking kids.

49:20.020 --> 49:22.980
That should be a moment where even if you're Ed,

49:22.980 --> 49:25.700
and you are craving her wave, right?

49:26.980 --> 49:29.780
And you have deep beef with your grandson,

49:29.780 --> 49:33.940
but then this other human being seems very excited.

49:33.940 --> 49:36.340
That's where you should go like, oh, uh.

49:36.900 --> 49:38.820
Yeah, you should call somebody about that.

49:38.820 --> 49:41.060
Man, I would rather, oh, Bob De Niro,

49:41.060 --> 49:42.660
give me a four alarm ass whip

49:42.660 --> 49:44.820
and then delete my fucking Minecraft save.

49:51.460 --> 49:54.260
I'd let that dude just fuck me up with a two by four

49:54.260 --> 49:57.300
before I let him anywhere near my Minecraft village.

49:57.300 --> 50:00.500
I'd love it if he was like a 20 minute scene

50:00.500 --> 50:02.660
of him destroying his Minecraft castle.

50:02.660 --> 50:05.140
And then Oaks was like, yeah, okay.

50:05.140 --> 50:06.420
And just reloaded it.

50:06.420 --> 50:08.980
It's clocking, I got a cloud save, my dude.

50:08.980 --> 50:10.900
Yeah, it's in the cloud, dumb dumb.

50:10.900 --> 50:13.780
I, was there also a moment in there

50:13.780 --> 50:17.860
that was just brushing up against a little stolen valor?

50:19.540 --> 50:22.340
Yeah, a little bit stolen valor from Chris Walken.

50:23.140 --> 50:24.260
But you know what?

50:24.260 --> 50:25.860
Later you see him in a suit.

50:25.860 --> 50:27.860
Later you see him in a Santa suit.

50:27.860 --> 50:30.580
So that's stolen valor twice in one trailer, Chris.

50:31.300 --> 50:31.940
You sure?

50:33.380 --> 50:35.860
Just gently brushing up stolen valor there.

50:35.860 --> 50:38.260
Yeah, I'm the real Santa Claus.

50:38.260 --> 50:39.220
How dare you, sir?

50:40.420 --> 50:43.220
I need a 10% discount at the movie theaters.

50:43.780 --> 50:45.700
Oh, holy shit.

50:45.700 --> 50:46.500
The real one.

50:47.060 --> 50:49.540
Okay, so the most baffling shot in this trailer,

50:49.540 --> 50:50.740
if you're watching this trailer,

50:51.380 --> 50:54.580
you're watching this trailer and you're loving it.

50:54.580 --> 50:55.540
You're losing it.

50:55.540 --> 50:56.980
I don't want to distract you too much

50:56.980 --> 50:58.420
from how much you're enjoying it.

50:58.420 --> 51:01.300
But I do want to draw your attention to 155,

51:01.300 --> 51:03.540
where I'm going to give you a shot for shot breakdown

51:03.540 --> 51:05.220
because I cannot make fucking heads or tails of it.

51:05.220 --> 51:05.540
Okay.

51:05.540 --> 51:08.260
Okay, we see in sequence.

51:08.260 --> 51:10.980
Sorry, let me slow down the playback speed

51:10.980 --> 51:12.660
to the slowest possible.

51:12.660 --> 51:16.660
Okay, so we see a shot of,

51:17.700 --> 51:19.300
at the top of the ladder is Bob De Niro.

51:19.300 --> 51:20.500
He's hanging Christmas lights.

51:20.500 --> 51:20.820
Got it.

51:21.540 --> 51:23.060
He gets shocked by the wire.

51:23.060 --> 51:25.460
We see an elf look up from the snow

51:25.460 --> 51:27.380
and Bobby D is falling.

51:28.260 --> 51:28.820
An elf?

51:29.940 --> 51:32.100
A little child elf, probably Oaks.

51:32.100 --> 51:32.820
I think it's Oaks.

51:33.700 --> 51:34.900
He's dressed as an elf.

51:34.900 --> 51:38.660
He looks up and sees his grandfather falling.

51:38.660 --> 51:41.780
The ladder is falling backwards into a bouncy castle.

51:41.780 --> 51:46.820
And we see a shot of Ed looking very distraught

51:46.820 --> 51:50.020
in his Santa cap as he falls plummeting.

51:50.020 --> 51:51.940
Probably he has to assume to his death.

51:51.940 --> 51:56.260
Yeah, then we see a wide of him falling in the bouncy castle.

51:56.260 --> 51:58.020
Let's hope it's a stubble.

51:58.020 --> 52:01.540
Probably I'm just going to say a red herring for the trailer.

52:01.540 --> 52:04.900
And then the next shot at the cutaway

52:06.020 --> 52:12.340
is someone in a Santa costume landing on the ground.

52:12.340 --> 52:13.460
That's what I'm saying.

52:13.460 --> 52:15.060
But it's different.

52:15.060 --> 52:15.860
It's different.

52:15.860 --> 52:19.220
It's Santa falling on the ground and it's Christopher Walken.

52:19.220 --> 52:22.260
So this shot has taken us a composite

52:22.260 --> 52:24.820
of Bobby D falling into a bounce castle

52:24.820 --> 52:27.540
and then he rises again as Christopher Walken dressed as Santa.

52:27.540 --> 52:29.620
Yeah, it's almost like he died.

52:29.620 --> 52:33.140
And then Oaks Fegley had to go and bring the soul back,

52:33.140 --> 52:35.780
but the soul got lodged in Christopher Walken, if you will.

52:35.780 --> 52:37.700
Here's the part that fucking does piss me off.

52:37.700 --> 52:37.940
Okay.

52:38.740 --> 52:41.220
Oh, this is my favorite segment when we do,

52:41.220 --> 52:43.940
when we talk about this movie for an hour.

52:43.940 --> 52:45.860
Listen, just the one thing else.

52:45.860 --> 52:47.300
Okay, this is maybe the last thing.

52:47.300 --> 52:50.180
At 201 in the trailer of The War with Grandpa,

52:50.180 --> 52:52.420
at least on the MovieClips upload,

52:52.420 --> 52:58.980
at 201, we see a scene of Oaks and Salty Ed hugging.

52:58.980 --> 52:59.940
Yeah, huh.

52:59.940 --> 53:03.300
So like, I guess that's how it ends.

53:03.860 --> 53:05.380
Thanks, right?

53:05.380 --> 53:08.420
Like, why did we even have the entire fucking war?

53:08.420 --> 53:08.900
Red.

53:08.900 --> 53:10.900
Apparently at the end of it, they're just going to...

53:11.620 --> 53:13.860
How am I supposed to get excited about this war with grandpa

53:13.860 --> 53:15.540
whenever I know it ends with peace?

53:15.540 --> 53:18.020
Justin, it's a red herring, do not worry.

53:18.660 --> 53:20.020
That is something they put in the trailer

53:20.020 --> 53:21.540
that will not be in the actual movie

53:21.540 --> 53:24.740
because in the end, they mutually assured destruction.

53:24.740 --> 53:25.940
This is what I've decided now.

53:25.940 --> 53:29.940
Layers within layers within layers within layers.

53:29.940 --> 53:32.740
They both put snakes in each other's beds.

53:32.740 --> 53:36.260
And as the fangs sink in and they feel the injection of venom,

53:36.260 --> 53:40.180
they will both say, we weren't so different, you and I.

53:41.700 --> 53:43.700
As they stare into each other's eyes

53:43.700 --> 53:46.980
and die simultaneously like in the notebook.

53:46.980 --> 53:48.820
Now, I hate to continue to ruin this,

53:48.820 --> 53:52.020
but we do zoom out to see that Christopher Walken

53:54.180 --> 53:56.820
has been watching this entire scene play out

53:57.380 --> 53:58.660
from about three feet away.

53:58.660 --> 54:02.580
The camera pans down and we see in his hand

54:02.580 --> 54:06.740
a bottle labeled snake venom entered there.

54:06.740 --> 54:11.860
And he says, I guess it's true, we are all but shadows.

54:11.860 --> 54:13.780
And then he walks out the window.

54:13.780 --> 54:15.220
Yeah, he walks out the window.

54:15.220 --> 54:17.300
And he's wearing, he's dressed as Santa

54:17.300 --> 54:18.740
and he falls to his death.

54:18.740 --> 54:20.100
Okay.

54:20.100 --> 54:22.020
Yeah, he walks out the window dressed as Santa,

54:22.020 --> 54:23.220
falls to his death.

54:23.220 --> 54:25.380
His fingers, lifeless fingers,

54:25.380 --> 54:28.100
uncurl the bottle of anti-snake venom

54:28.100 --> 54:29.540
and Uma just starts screaming.

54:29.540 --> 54:31.540
She knows what's happened, she's lost every year.

54:31.540 --> 54:33.380
And this is not the first time this has happened to her,

54:33.380 --> 54:35.300
by the way, we find out about this later,

54:35.300 --> 54:39.140
but she's already lost an entire extended family

54:39.140 --> 54:40.580
to snake-related accidents.

54:40.580 --> 54:43.540
In the distance, there's just a man in a white suit

54:43.540 --> 54:45.380
who checks something off of a clipboard

54:45.380 --> 54:46.660
and then vanishes.

54:46.660 --> 54:48.420
The shitty thing is, it's not even,

54:49.460 --> 54:51.780
the snakes aren't even because of the war with grandpa,

54:51.780 --> 54:53.540
it's because the rat chewed through the damn cake.

54:53.540 --> 54:53.860
Yeah.

54:53.860 --> 54:54.340
Fuck.

54:54.340 --> 54:56.020
So we don't even learn that till the end.

54:56.020 --> 54:56.260
Yeah.

54:57.380 --> 54:59.220
Thank you for listening to our podcast.

54:59.780 --> 55:01.140
We have run out of...

55:02.340 --> 55:04.900
We don't have time for a Yahoo or...

55:04.900 --> 55:06.740
No, we don't have any time for anything in this one,

55:06.740 --> 55:08.260
but gosh, it was a good discussion

55:08.260 --> 55:09.300
of the war with grandpa.

55:09.300 --> 55:11.060
Maybe the best we've ever had.

55:11.060 --> 55:12.180
One of our top discussions,

55:12.180 --> 55:14.100
we're gonna keep a really close eye on this flick.

55:15.140 --> 55:19.220
And what a treat, what a treat we have to look forward to.

55:19.220 --> 55:22.580
This is just a quick reminder, don't go to movie theaters.

55:22.580 --> 55:24.580
Don't go to the movie theater, even if it's a fucking goof,

55:24.580 --> 55:26.580
to go see this movie and send us your ticket stuff

55:26.580 --> 55:28.500
or whatever, don't, don't, don't do it.

55:28.500 --> 55:30.580
Well, okay, if you wanna buy a ticket to something

55:30.580 --> 55:31.700
then not go into the movie.

55:31.700 --> 55:32.260
That's fine.

55:32.260 --> 55:34.340
Or this great flick, I'm absolutely into that.

55:34.340 --> 55:38.100
We have to get to the hundred year war with grandpa.

55:38.100 --> 55:41.540
Yeah, no problem at all, but thank you.

55:41.540 --> 55:43.540
Thank you also to...

55:43.540 --> 55:47.060
No, sorry, we'll do Travis then Griffin.

55:47.060 --> 55:49.060
Okay, we wrote a how to podcast book

55:49.060 --> 55:51.380
and we just got like the first like preview copies of it.

55:51.380 --> 55:53.140
And listen, I'm not just saying this

55:53.140 --> 55:55.380
because it's our book, it's really good.

55:55.380 --> 55:58.580
It's like a well-made book, all the pages stay in there

55:58.580 --> 56:00.900
no matter how hard you flop it around,

56:00.900 --> 56:01.780
you're gonna love it.

56:01.780 --> 56:03.300
And it will teach you how to make a podcast

56:03.300 --> 56:05.700
that you're proud of and it's like fun and funny.

56:05.700 --> 56:08.660
And funny, Teresa was reading it and laughing out loud

56:08.660 --> 56:10.500
and it is hard to make Teresa laugh.

56:10.500 --> 56:12.020
Wow, so there it is.

56:12.020 --> 56:12.740
You can pre-order it.

56:12.740 --> 56:14.100
Maybe his wife read his podcast.

56:14.100 --> 56:15.620
She chose to, sir.

56:15.620 --> 56:16.420
Grim.

56:16.420 --> 56:18.820
It's called, everybody has a podcast except you.

56:18.820 --> 56:19.620
You can pre-order it.

56:19.620 --> 56:20.900
What, you?

56:20.900 --> 56:21.460
Sure.

56:21.460 --> 56:21.940
I think.

56:21.940 --> 56:23.620
No, it's except.

56:23.620 --> 56:24.100
Except?

56:24.100 --> 56:24.340
Yep.

56:25.060 --> 56:25.540
But?

56:25.540 --> 56:26.260
But would have been better.

56:27.060 --> 56:29.380
You can pre-order it at McElroyPodcastBook.com.

56:29.380 --> 56:31.300
Real fucking funny.

56:32.020 --> 56:32.580
Fuck.

56:32.580 --> 56:34.500
McElroyPodcastBook.com.

56:34.500 --> 56:36.580
It's a total family entertainer.

56:36.580 --> 56:37.620
Fun for the whole family.

56:37.620 --> 56:38.580
You gotta get this book.

56:38.580 --> 56:39.540
This book is the new cool.

56:39.540 --> 56:40.180
Hey, and thanks to John Roderick.

56:40.180 --> 56:41.620
This book is the new cool.

56:41.620 --> 56:43.140
So thanks to John Roderick and Long Winter

56:43.140 --> 56:44.260
who's theme song is set apart,

56:44.260 --> 56:45.620
chopped the album, putting the days to bed

56:45.620 --> 56:46.980
and also to maximum fun.

56:47.620 --> 56:50.340
Both of these fucking good guys are the new cool.

56:50.900 --> 56:52.420
Yep, for sure, for sure.

I almost feel like maybe we don't do a final Yahoo.

56:56.820 --> 57:02.260
Yeah, I think that's the end of the episode.

57:02.260 --> 57:03.220
I can do a movies one.

57:03.220 --> 57:04.100
I have a movies one.

57:04.100 --> 57:05.860
Here's a final movies one.

57:05.860 --> 57:08.340
Just cap off our little popcorn bucket to the stars.

57:09.300 --> 57:10.740
This was sent by Graham Roebuck.

57:10.740 --> 57:11.540
Thanks, Graham.

57:11.540 --> 57:15.620
It's a Yahoo answer user named Aaron who asks,

57:16.900 --> 57:18.820
Kevin Smith, if you're out there

57:18.820 --> 57:20.980
after you and Bruce Willis feud,

57:20.980 --> 57:23.940
can you still watch and enjoy Bruce Willis movies?

57:26.980 --> 57:27.780
My name is Justin McElroy.

57:27.780 --> 57:28.900
I'm Travis McElroy.

57:28.900 --> 57:29.700
I'm Griffin McElroy.

57:29.700 --> 57:31.380
I can't believe we've done this.

57:31.380 --> 57:33.300
This has been My Brother, My Brother Made Kiss Your Dad

57:33.300 --> 57:34.260
Square on the Lips.
