00:00.000 --> 00:07.080
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:07.080 --> 00:12.520
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:12.520 --> 00:17.800
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how

00:17.800 --> 00:22.120
cool they are for listening.

00:22.120 --> 00:23.120
What's up, you cool baby?

00:23.120 --> 00:49.120
It's familiar, but not too familiar, but not too not familiar.

00:49.120 --> 01:03.800
Hello, everyone, and welcome to my brother, my brother, mean advice show for the modern

01:03.800 --> 01:07.160
era.

01:07.160 --> 01:14.640
Like Chilean miners emerging from their holes, we have returned to you, Boston.

01:14.640 --> 01:15.640
From their holes.

01:15.640 --> 01:16.640
From their mine holes.

01:16.640 --> 01:21.120
My name is, I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

01:21.120 --> 01:22.680
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

01:22.680 --> 01:26.560
I'm your baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

01:26.560 --> 01:32.120
So Boston, Boston, I need to, we need to talk for a second before we get started.

01:32.120 --> 01:33.120
Can we get real?

01:33.120 --> 01:37.040
Listen, listen, Boston, shut up.

01:37.040 --> 01:43.120
It's going to be a few months until we can do a live show again.

01:43.120 --> 01:47.080
I don't know if you know this, but my wife is just dating a baby and Griffin's wife is

01:47.080 --> 01:49.080
just dating a baby.

01:49.080 --> 01:51.080
It's true.

01:51.080 --> 01:55.920
So this might be our last one for a grip of time.

01:55.920 --> 01:59.840
So that leads me to my question, Boston.

01:59.840 --> 02:03.320
We were thinking, is this going to be the last one we do for a while?

02:03.320 --> 02:08.320
Are you ready to get weird?

02:08.320 --> 02:25.000
Oh, yeah.

02:25.000 --> 02:29.800
We thought just for this one, we get weird because Griffin, what did you think?

02:29.800 --> 02:31.040
You thought something.

02:31.040 --> 02:36.760
We took a poll before when everybody was coming in and we have the results of the poll available

02:36.760 --> 02:37.760
now, Griffin.

02:37.760 --> 02:43.400
And I've been looking at the data and I've had my analysts going over the data and it

02:43.400 --> 02:47.840
seems like just based on sort of the demo, which is what we call demographics in the

02:47.840 --> 03:00.040
data analysis industry, that there's a 90 to 92% chance that they horny for this.

03:00.040 --> 03:05.040
And now we're going to produce actual content and not just fucking hype ourselves up.

03:05.040 --> 03:07.800
Grab in because it's content time.

03:07.800 --> 03:14.320
By the way, everybody, you're welcome for the hot poke stop lure that I dropped here.

03:14.320 --> 03:15.320
I just hit 13.

03:15.320 --> 03:16.800
Travis just hit level 13.

03:16.800 --> 03:17.800
What up?

03:17.800 --> 03:18.800
We're having a great day.

03:18.800 --> 03:21.640
I've been catching a lot of ghastlies, a lot of ratata.

03:21.640 --> 03:26.480
I got to say, Boston, I don't know if y'all have like a city slogan, but if you do, it

03:26.480 --> 03:32.760
should be, we have like infinite drowsies up in this motherfucker.

03:32.760 --> 03:38.880
That's the state bird.

03:38.880 --> 03:44.240
Also as long as we're talking about Boston, so when you come to Boston, what's the one

03:44.240 --> 03:46.240
thing you're going to do?

03:46.240 --> 03:47.240
No.

03:47.240 --> 03:48.240
Wrong.

03:48.240 --> 03:49.240
Wrong.

03:49.240 --> 03:50.240
Wrong.

03:50.240 --> 03:52.280
I didn't hear it anywhere.

03:52.280 --> 03:53.280
Okay.

03:53.280 --> 03:55.000
This was a poorly conceived bit.

03:55.000 --> 03:59.800
Let me give you a hint.

03:59.800 --> 04:04.560
In common, everybody's favorite sitcom with the guy from Yes, Dear that ran for TV.

04:04.560 --> 04:06.760
Travis made us go to fucking Cheers today.

04:06.760 --> 04:10.560
Now, wait, here's the conversation.

04:10.560 --> 04:15.280
We're walking there with a dear friend to Cheers, and he's from New York, and he said,

04:15.280 --> 04:17.680
so what made you guys want to go to Cheers?

04:17.680 --> 04:19.320
You guys must be big fans.

04:19.320 --> 04:24.800
Took a quick poll, the three of us, and none of the... Travis is insistent that we go

04:24.800 --> 04:25.800
to Cheers.

04:25.800 --> 04:32.200
I want to make this super clear, has never seen an episode of Cheers.

04:32.200 --> 04:36.240
You know how I think sad lives are funny?

04:36.240 --> 04:38.880
You think the existence of Cheers is funny.

04:38.880 --> 04:43.960
Sometimes I think really not funny things are funny, and dragging my brother and our

04:43.960 --> 04:47.480
friend JD to Cheers was one of those.

04:47.480 --> 04:53.840
We lasted all of 30 seconds before the words 35 minute wait escaped the hostess' mouth.

04:53.840 --> 04:56.200
Too many minutes to wait.

04:56.200 --> 05:00.080
I was horrified before we knew what the wait was when we walked up and we saw a couple

05:00.080 --> 05:06.640
taking a picture in front of the Cheers sign, and they said, one, two, three, Cheers.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.140
You can't do that, actually.

05:08.140 --> 05:10.560
That's against the law.

05:10.560 --> 05:12.120
What you did there was a crime.

05:12.120 --> 05:14.480
It was a crime.

05:14.480 --> 05:18.040
It wasn't nice of Ted Danson to stop by, though.

05:18.040 --> 05:19.040
Was he in?

05:19.040 --> 05:20.040
He greeted the door.

05:20.040 --> 05:21.040
He was in Cheers then.

05:21.040 --> 05:26.400
Okay, so what we do on this show is we take your questions, and we turn them alchemy-like

05:26.400 --> 05:27.400
into wisdom.

05:27.400 --> 05:32.640
And special for our live shows is we will do audience questions, but we have a very

05:32.640 --> 05:34.640
specific rule.

05:34.640 --> 05:37.660
No bummers, that's right.

05:37.660 --> 05:43.240
And also keep it short, if you could, and a new facet that we've had to add after a

05:43.240 --> 05:47.600
recent show, apolitical, if you don't mind.

05:47.600 --> 05:48.600
That would go down real smooth.

05:48.600 --> 05:52.040
I believe the microphone is over in that area.

05:52.040 --> 05:54.040
We'll bring up house lights when it comes time to not trip and fall over each other.

05:54.040 --> 05:57.080
Yeah, it'll be super, super casual live show hang set.

05:57.080 --> 05:58.560
Just a real laid back.

05:58.560 --> 05:59.560
Let's do some questions, though.

05:59.560 --> 06:00.560
Wild and crazy kids.

06:00.560 --> 06:01.840
All right, here comes the first question.

06:01.840 --> 06:06.000
This is from someone from this area who I think will be here, so after I read the question,

06:06.000 --> 06:07.600
please let me know.

06:07.600 --> 06:10.600
My mom is completely obsessed with the musician Sting.

06:10.600 --> 06:13.320
Oh, so it's everyone's mom's, then.

06:13.320 --> 06:14.320
Wait, are you here?

06:14.320 --> 06:16.400
Yeah, okay, so everybody's mom's are into Sting, cool.

06:16.400 --> 06:22.520
Whenever he's going on tour, she buys tickets to his shows multiple times to get better

06:22.520 --> 06:27.420
seats, and in just everyday conversation, she'll insert comments like, you know, Sting

06:27.420 --> 06:28.760
also does sessions.

06:28.760 --> 06:38.840
It's cool your mom has so many conversations about tantric fucking.

06:38.840 --> 06:39.840
And double stuffed Oreos.

06:39.840 --> 06:40.840
The two things I know about Sting.

06:40.840 --> 06:41.840
Motherfucker loves double stuffed Oreos.

06:41.840 --> 06:42.840
That's a reference everyone can enjoy.

06:42.840 --> 06:51.040
She managed to find him on a street corner in New York just based on her knowledge of

06:51.040 --> 06:52.040
where he lives.

06:52.040 --> 06:53.040
What?

06:53.040 --> 06:54.600
This is kind of a one way.

06:54.600 --> 06:57.400
No, no, it'll be two way later on.

06:57.400 --> 07:01.640
Just based on her knowledge of where he lives and his activity on social media.

07:01.640 --> 07:05.840
That's also a criminal crime from the laws.

07:05.840 --> 07:06.840
Sting crime.

07:06.840 --> 07:09.120
Hold on, I got wifi here right now.

07:09.120 --> 07:10.120
Let me just look up.

07:10.120 --> 07:15.520
Yeah, that's a criminal crime from the federal law book.

07:15.520 --> 07:19.160
The question is, should I do something about this?

07:19.160 --> 07:20.160
That's from Tom in Red Hook.

07:20.160 --> 07:21.160
Tom, are you here?

07:21.160 --> 07:22.160
Hi Tom.

07:22.160 --> 07:23.160
Okay, oh shit.

07:23.160 --> 07:29.520
Tom is apparently a tuvian throat singer.

07:29.520 --> 07:32.560
How do you feel about Sting?

07:32.560 --> 07:33.560
No feelings whatsoever.

07:33.560 --> 07:34.560
No feelings on Sting.

07:34.560 --> 07:38.800
I'll be honest, that's exactly how I feel about Sting.

07:38.800 --> 07:43.840
Let me take you inside, Tom was about to drop the hammer on Sting and then the thought

07:43.840 --> 07:47.600
flashed across his head, wait, Sting could be here.

07:47.600 --> 07:48.600
Sting might be here.

07:48.600 --> 07:49.600
I need to play it cool.

07:49.600 --> 07:53.840
My mom would be so pissed if I put Sting on blast and Gordon was in the room.

07:53.840 --> 07:56.600
What could you possibly do at this point for your mom?

07:56.600 --> 07:57.600
What are you going to do?

07:57.600 --> 08:00.200
Look at her and go, mom, cool it and her go, yeah, you know what?

08:00.200 --> 08:01.200
No, you're right.

08:01.200 --> 08:04.120
Now that you mention it, I've gone over the top.

08:04.120 --> 08:11.120
Yeah, I think tracking down Sting based on his GPS signal that you hacked from the government

08:11.120 --> 08:12.280
is you've already-

08:12.280 --> 08:13.280
Yeah, I've got it.

08:13.280 --> 08:14.960
You need to do immersion therapy with your mom.

08:14.960 --> 08:18.080
You need to get Sting to come and hang out with her every minute of every day for the

08:18.080 --> 08:21.600
next two weeks until she looks at you and goes, I'm fucking sick of Sting.

08:21.600 --> 08:22.600
Yeah.

08:22.600 --> 08:23.600
Yeah, they did it.

08:23.600 --> 08:29.980
Yeah, if Sting could pick up a dish for once and wash it and someone, no, I take 12 hours

08:29.980 --> 08:31.240
to wash a dish.

08:31.240 --> 08:32.240
That's the problem.

08:32.240 --> 08:36.400
Yeah, that's the problem actually with this tantric stuff is that he's been in you for

08:36.400 --> 08:41.880
five days and at that point, you're just like, I'm tired of Sting.

08:41.880 --> 08:44.360
He's been brushing his teeth for 13 hours.

08:44.360 --> 08:46.960
I need to get in the bathroom, Sting.

08:46.960 --> 08:50.040
He's the only human being who listens to podcasts at half speed.

08:50.040 --> 08:52.240
He loves to say it.

08:52.240 --> 08:54.560
I want to accentuate the goofs.

08:54.560 --> 08:57.160
Okay, great, Sting.

08:57.160 --> 09:00.800
I'm Marc Maron.

09:00.800 --> 09:02.600
Welcome to my podcast.

09:02.600 --> 09:06.000
Tom, let me give you some friendly advice.

09:06.000 --> 09:12.760
Don't make your mom choose between you and Sting.

09:12.760 --> 09:18.000
You may not like the way that particular deal breaks.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
Here's a quick quiz.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.200
Actually, we can solve this right now.

09:20.200 --> 09:24.440
Were you in the police?

09:24.440 --> 09:26.100
Probably not.

09:26.100 --> 09:27.200
You might have been.

09:27.200 --> 09:30.240
I don't know the other fellows who were in there, frankly.

09:30.240 --> 09:34.880
So yeah, you could totally pull one over on us right now, vis-a-vis the police members.

09:34.880 --> 09:39.600
Do you guys want a Yahoo answer?

09:39.600 --> 09:40.600
Rare exception.

09:40.600 --> 09:41.600
No.

09:41.600 --> 09:45.280
Was Danny Elfman in the police, who was the other fool in the police?

09:45.280 --> 09:46.280
Stuart Copeland.

09:46.280 --> 09:51.640
He wrote the theme song, The Equalizer, which is fucking... Do we have that queued up?

09:51.640 --> 09:55.920
No, we don't have that one, but we'll get it for you later.

09:55.920 --> 09:58.360
Yeah, I'd like a Yahoo.

09:58.360 --> 10:02.320
A hot Yahoo here from the Yahoo Answers service.

10:02.320 --> 10:05.680
It was sent in by, right in high, Zoe Kinski.

10:05.680 --> 10:08.120
Thank you, Zoe.

10:08.120 --> 10:14.160
It's by Yahoo Answers user, sorry, something has gone wrong.

10:14.160 --> 10:19.120
We'll call them Sting.

10:19.120 --> 10:21.040
He spends five days inside of you.

10:21.040 --> 10:25.920
He gets bored, he gets on his phone, and he wants to know some stuff on Yahoo Answers

10:25.920 --> 10:27.360
like this.

10:27.360 --> 10:42.120
Did Guy Fieri ever eat a meal in Diner, Drive-In, or Dive that he didn't think was totally awesome?

10:42.120 --> 10:46.780
I've been to a few of the restaurants they've been on his show and had the same meals he

10:46.780 --> 10:47.780
had on TV.

10:47.780 --> 10:54.520
I must tell, most of them really sucked by a wide margin.

10:54.520 --> 11:00.040
I know, TV requires him to be super excited with every bite, but come on, man, Guy really

11:00.040 --> 11:08.440
must be a huge tool bag to go into Diner after Diner and watch these people cook crap food

11:08.440 --> 11:09.440
day after day.

11:09.440 --> 11:10.440
Who's the tool bag now?

11:10.440 --> 11:15.720
And then shovel that crap into your hole and act like it's the best thing he ever ate.

11:15.720 --> 11:19.320
That takes a certain kind of tool bag.

11:19.320 --> 11:21.840
I don't care how much they pay him.

11:21.840 --> 11:26.680
There isn't enough money to make me become a totally different person for a living.

11:26.680 --> 11:28.880
This question took a wonderful turn.

11:28.880 --> 11:29.880
Hold on.

11:29.880 --> 11:30.880
Isn't there?

11:30.880 --> 11:35.680
Yahoo Answers question asked, how much money would it take before you ate something and

11:35.680 --> 11:39.720
went, this is delicious, because I guarantee it's way less than you are claiming here,

11:39.720 --> 11:41.320
which is no amount.

11:41.320 --> 11:47.720
He looks like two Smash Mouths got crushed together in the Large Hadron Collider.

11:47.720 --> 11:52.880
He's never said a word that wasn't screamed through a throatful of chili fries, but what

11:52.880 --> 11:59.120
I don't like about Guy Fieri is he seems a little disingenuous.

11:59.120 --> 12:03.400
I was actually ready to jump on the like, fuck Guy Fieri, like what a tool bag, until

12:03.400 --> 12:07.080
he started listening to me, I was like, maybe he's doing something for the mom and pop industry

12:07.080 --> 12:11.160
of America, where he goes in and eats the crap food from these mom and pop diners, and

12:11.160 --> 12:15.600
he looks at the camera and goes, it was great.

12:15.600 --> 12:16.600
Come here.

12:16.600 --> 12:18.800
Guy Fieri came to Hillbilly Hot Dogs in Huntington, West Virginia.

12:18.800 --> 12:19.800
That's right.

12:19.800 --> 12:20.800
Yeah, what's up, Huntington?

12:20.800 --> 12:27.480
Had himself a home wrecker, which is a foot-long hot dog that is 18 inches long.

12:27.480 --> 12:31.120
It's a weird name for it, if you think about it, and it has lots of stuff on it, and he

12:31.120 --> 12:35.680
ate the whole thing, and then he brought it on Jay Leno's show, which is the perfect venue.

12:35.680 --> 12:38.800
He regurgitated it into Jay Leno's mouth like a baby bird.

12:38.800 --> 12:39.800
It was fucking insane.

12:39.800 --> 12:44.040
The answer to your question of whether or not Guy Fieri's ever had anything he didn't

12:44.040 --> 12:46.400
think was totally awesome is, of course, yes, obviously.

12:46.400 --> 12:49.200
But what this question posits is that he's an amazing act.

12:49.200 --> 12:54.320
No, he's a true fucking professional who's in there day in, day out eating trash for

12:54.320 --> 12:57.480
you to mock him from the sidelines.

12:57.480 --> 13:02.600
He eats those cheddar jalapeno popper explosions, and he eats them, and then his brain goes,

13:02.600 --> 13:07.480
I've had better, but his face screams, yes, yes, please got another.

13:07.480 --> 13:12.120
Everyone in Flavortown just had a simultaneous orgasm.

13:12.120 --> 13:15.720
My brothers and I ate there with a friend of ours named Lynn, and it was a delicious

13:15.720 --> 13:16.720
meal.

13:16.720 --> 13:22.120
It was a delicious meal, and I think he does a hell of a restaurant.

13:22.120 --> 13:23.920
I just want to say- His restaurant's real good.

13:23.920 --> 13:25.360
If his restaurant is in question, it was a fine meal.

13:25.360 --> 13:33.720
As far as food that you eat as a joke goes- High marks all around.

13:33.720 --> 13:36.720
Can I interest you all in another question?

13:36.720 --> 13:37.720
Yes, please.

13:37.720 --> 13:38.720
Yes.

13:38.720 --> 13:39.720
One of my friends in...

13:39.720 --> 13:40.720
I want a munch.

13:40.720 --> 13:41.720
This bitch.

13:41.720 --> 13:42.720
I want too much.

13:42.720 --> 13:47.720
Welcome to Munch Squad.

13:47.720 --> 13:53.720
How many of you, this is your first time listening to my brother, my brother, and me?

13:53.720 --> 13:54.720
Hold on.

13:54.720 --> 13:56.960
Let the applause roll in for Munch Squad.

13:56.960 --> 13:57.960
Justin.

13:57.960 --> 13:58.960
Team Mac.

13:58.960 --> 13:59.960
I got to stand for this one.

13:59.960 --> 14:04.200
Can you get me another brewski open so I can tell everybody about Domino's unveiling a

14:04.200 --> 14:10.160
new pizza burger hybrid called the Pizza Burger.

14:10.160 --> 14:14.600
Munch Squad, if you don't know, is a bit where I talk about the new food trends coming to

14:14.600 --> 14:16.960
fast food restaurants, fast casual.

14:16.960 --> 14:20.520
It is six episodes old.

14:20.520 --> 14:21.800
It's a classic.

14:21.800 --> 14:23.800
Here's the tagline.

14:23.800 --> 14:29.280
Here's the tagline.

14:29.280 --> 14:30.280
It's upside down.

14:30.280 --> 14:31.280
There you go.

14:31.280 --> 14:34.760
Looks like a burger, tastes like a pizza.

14:34.760 --> 14:35.760
Simple enough.

14:35.760 --> 14:36.760
Easy enough to understand.

14:36.760 --> 14:39.160
I would like my food to look-

14:39.160 --> 14:40.600
Looks like a garbage can.

14:40.600 --> 14:44.240
Tastes like 10 tacos.

14:44.240 --> 14:45.240
It's a garbage can full of tacos.

14:45.240 --> 14:47.760
You're going to love it.

14:47.760 --> 14:48.760
So we have quotes.

14:48.760 --> 14:52.000
The thing about Munch Squad is I take the quotes directly from the professionals, the

14:52.000 --> 14:54.780
people who should know what this food is like.

14:54.780 --> 15:01.000
The first comes to us from S. Murugan, who is the senior vice president of marketing

15:01.000 --> 15:03.120
for Domino's Pizza India, where the-

15:03.120 --> 15:04.120
Oh, man.

15:04.120 --> 15:05.120
I can't get one of these bad boys.

15:05.120 --> 15:06.120
Nah.

15:06.120 --> 15:07.880
The burger pizza is exclusive.

15:07.880 --> 15:10.960
And here's what he says about it.

15:10.960 --> 15:16.480
The burger pizza is different from conventional burgers in many ways.

15:16.480 --> 15:20.360
I can think of one major way off the top of my head.

15:20.360 --> 15:23.480
I want to clarify, in case you can't picture it in your head, if you're picturing like

15:23.480 --> 15:25.360
a pizza-flavored burger, you are wrong.

15:25.360 --> 15:27.360
If you're picturing a calzone, fucking leave.

15:27.360 --> 15:29.400
Just fucking leave.

15:29.400 --> 15:37.240
Picture like an egg and cheese McMuffin, except it's mostly made out of pizza.

15:37.240 --> 15:48.680
So the burger pizza is the chain's attempt to break into the all day individual consumption

15:48.680 --> 16:05.960
market, which is of course what Guy Fieri calls his home.

16:05.960 --> 16:19.320
We aim to address the desire for a burger through a new kind of pizza.

16:19.320 --> 16:22.320
Something came out of Travis on that one.

16:22.320 --> 16:25.600
It makes no sense.

16:25.600 --> 16:30.720
It is available at the more than 1,000 Domino's Pizza locations in India.

16:30.720 --> 16:32.220
How's it going, India?

16:32.220 --> 16:37.640
But unfortunately for America, burger and pizza lovers, it is an available state side.

16:37.640 --> 16:41.640
I think they're assuming a lot by thinking that burger and pizza lovers are going to

16:41.640 --> 16:45.920
be a fan of this fucking Island of Dr. Moreau style.

16:45.920 --> 16:50.120
The only way that works is if every time someone went to a restaurant, they ordered both pizza

16:50.120 --> 16:53.240
and burger because they couldn't decide between the two.

16:53.240 --> 16:54.240
Right.

16:54.240 --> 16:55.240
No, I want pizza.

16:55.240 --> 16:59.680
If you find it hard to choose between burgers and pizza when you're hungry-

16:59.680 --> 17:01.560
And oh man, that's every day for me.

17:01.560 --> 17:02.560
For sure.

17:02.560 --> 17:05.760
Domino's has a solution for you.

17:05.760 --> 17:08.960
The appropriately, if not so creatively tiled burger pizza.

17:08.960 --> 17:09.960
Does it say that in there?

17:09.960 --> 17:10.960
Wait, hold on.

17:10.960 --> 17:11.960
Is that a quote?

17:11.960 --> 17:12.960
That's a quote from the fucking article.

17:12.960 --> 17:14.240
We did a shitty job.

17:14.240 --> 17:15.240
We get it.

17:15.240 --> 17:17.040
We get it.

17:17.040 --> 17:22.720
The burger pizza hybrid costs an affordable 89 rupees or $1.33.

17:22.720 --> 17:25.160
Holy shit.

17:25.160 --> 17:27.120
How much did your lunch cost, Justin?

17:27.120 --> 17:29.680
I'd rather not say.

17:29.680 --> 17:35.760
Unlike this is a direct quote from Dev Amaritesh, president and chief business officer of Domino's

17:35.760 --> 17:39.240
Pizza India, as I'm certain you know.

17:39.240 --> 17:43.240
Unlike other burgers, the burger pizza is comfort food.

17:43.240 --> 17:45.120
No.

17:45.120 --> 17:48.100
Unlike the health food burgers you're all used to.

17:48.100 --> 17:56.120
Unlike other burgers, burger pizza is comfort food, full of pizza goodness and has been

17:56.120 --> 17:59.920
specifically designed for the Indian palate.

17:59.920 --> 18:01.520
Okay.

18:01.520 --> 18:02.520
Sure.

18:02.520 --> 18:11.480
Anyway, that is the story on burger pizza.

18:11.480 --> 18:20.320
You just closed your computer, but do you really want to read a question for us now?

18:20.320 --> 18:21.920
Thank you, Jeeves.

18:21.920 --> 18:22.920
One second.

18:22.920 --> 18:23.920
I got some owls on my screen.

18:23.920 --> 18:27.240
Let me swipe them out of the way, and we're going to get this show rolling here.

18:27.240 --> 18:29.640
As soon as we deal with these fucking owls.

18:29.640 --> 18:31.680
The owls on my screen saver.

18:31.680 --> 18:36.480
One of my friends believes in mermaids.

18:36.480 --> 18:40.180
At first, I thought it was some sort of inside joke I wasn't getting and didn't pay much

18:40.180 --> 18:44.240
attention to it, but then she almost broke up with her boyfriend when he tried to explain

18:44.240 --> 18:47.320
to her that they are fictional.

18:47.320 --> 18:51.240
She constantly points to the fake Discovery Channel documentary as proof of her existence.

18:51.240 --> 18:52.240
Good work, Discovery Channel.

18:52.240 --> 18:53.600
Oh, it's going to be totally harmless.

18:53.600 --> 18:54.600
Fun joke.

18:54.600 --> 18:55.600
Fun joke.

18:55.600 --> 18:56.600
Cool ratings.

18:56.600 --> 18:57.600
Cool job, guys.

18:57.600 --> 19:01.240
In college, she took marine biology classes and is even trying to get a job in an aquarium

19:01.240 --> 19:06.440
with hopes of someday learning enough to go out and find the mermaids herself.

19:06.440 --> 19:09.960
She has been venting about it to me lately, and I have no idea what to do.

19:09.960 --> 19:13.380
Should I let her have her delusions or try to burst her bubble?

19:13.380 --> 19:15.040
That's from Miffed with mermaids.

19:15.040 --> 19:16.600
I have a two-part question.

19:16.600 --> 19:22.480
The second part, I'm going to skip to it, is this person who you are talking about here.

19:22.480 --> 19:23.480
Thank you.

19:23.480 --> 19:24.480
Yeah.

19:24.480 --> 19:25.480
You did great.

19:25.480 --> 19:27.760
We won't make that mistake a ninth time.

19:27.760 --> 19:28.760
Yeah.

19:28.760 --> 19:30.920
We've fallen into that trap before.

19:30.920 --> 19:33.920
We're done with interventions here on My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

19:33.920 --> 19:34.920
It's just advice.

19:34.920 --> 19:40.080
Now, she believes- Now, ask question one.

19:40.080 --> 19:44.120
Well, I got my answer because they said that she wasn't here.

19:44.120 --> 19:52.160
My favorite player in this tale is the boyfriend who I'm guessing should know better.

19:52.160 --> 19:53.160
Yeah, for sure.

19:53.160 --> 19:58.240
It sounds like this is a pretty defining characteristic of this individual.

19:58.240 --> 20:01.720
The boyfriend was probably having a shitty day and said, you know what?

20:01.720 --> 20:02.720
I'm going there.

20:02.720 --> 20:03.720
You know what?

20:03.720 --> 20:04.720
Yeah.

20:04.720 --> 20:05.720
I'm done dancing on eggshells.

20:05.720 --> 20:06.720
You know what?

20:06.720 --> 20:07.720
Fuck it.

20:07.720 --> 20:08.720
Today's the day.

20:08.720 --> 20:14.480
Tell me again about mermaids, Deborah.

20:14.480 --> 20:20.920
The New York Times recently ran an article, I think the headline was like, yes, there

20:20.920 --> 20:22.480
have been aliens.

20:22.480 --> 20:29.720
And I didn't read it, but the point of this article, I bet, was that the universe is so

20:29.720 --> 20:34.200
infinitely large and there's so many planets out there that certainly at some point there

20:34.200 --> 20:35.680
have been aliens.

20:35.680 --> 20:40.320
And I would like to pause at the same point here, which is to say there have been so many

20:40.320 --> 20:53.160
people that at some point one of them fucked a fish or a dolphin or a whale.

20:53.160 --> 20:57.120
There's 12 people like, yes.

20:57.120 --> 20:58.280
You got it.

20:58.280 --> 20:59.280
Life finds a way.

20:59.280 --> 21:04.820
I'm just saying, it's not my that would be fucking great.

21:04.820 --> 21:07.040
Mermaid Park, I don't understand where they're coming from.

21:07.040 --> 21:10.080
You were so busy worrying about it, you really didn't.

21:10.080 --> 21:13.840
Well, yeah, I didn't think people were fucking fish, yes.

21:13.840 --> 21:14.840
That's on me.

21:14.840 --> 21:15.840
People are getting killed by mermaids.

21:15.840 --> 21:21.320
I'll sit on this one because I didn't think people were going to fuck fish.

21:21.320 --> 21:24.440
I'm just saying it's not my thing, but I'm just saying, I get it.

21:24.440 --> 21:25.440
It's probably a thing.

21:25.440 --> 21:29.160
I don't want to yuck any yumps, but I'm just saying sometimes you see those salmon.

21:29.160 --> 21:30.960
I actually do want to yuck this yump.

21:30.960 --> 21:31.960
No, no, no, no.

21:31.960 --> 21:32.960
Please do not fuck fish.

21:32.960 --> 21:35.020
Let me describe the yum first.

21:35.020 --> 21:38.000
You see one of those salmon and they just finished spawning and they have that dope

21:38.000 --> 21:42.480
pearlescent red color and they look awesome.

21:42.480 --> 21:46.600
I'm saying not me, but somebody probably sees that and is like...

21:46.600 --> 21:49.720
I actually want to still yuck that.

21:49.720 --> 21:52.020
Might I yuck that, please?

21:52.020 --> 21:54.840
How much of the earth's deep oceans is unexplored?

21:54.840 --> 21:56.800
All of it.

21:56.800 --> 22:01.720
There's no way of... Prove to me that somewhere in the Mariana Trench... Okay, these are

22:01.720 --> 22:02.720
probably mermaids.

22:02.720 --> 22:06.200
A lot of people think that they're going to be human size, but it's a human fucking a

22:06.200 --> 22:07.200
fish, right?

22:07.200 --> 22:08.200
Yeah.

22:08.200 --> 22:14.680
So why wouldn't they be like human top, fish bottom, but on fish scale like David the gnome

22:14.680 --> 22:16.980
of mermaids?

22:16.980 --> 22:20.680
What I'm saying is how deep have we been in the Mariana Trench?

22:20.680 --> 22:22.360
Not particularly deep, I'd assume.

22:22.360 --> 22:27.560
If this is what's waiting for us down there, we've gone deep enough.

22:27.560 --> 22:32.120
Can I also say that I think it is silly of us to assume that it'll be half and half,

22:32.120 --> 22:35.280
which is not how breeding ever works.

22:35.280 --> 22:41.600
You think it's like fish, guy, fish, guy, like 10%, 10%.

22:41.600 --> 22:42.600
Yeah.

22:42.600 --> 22:44.560
Evenly spaced.

22:44.560 --> 22:51.120
This is like... But if it's more like a calico and kind of splotches everywhere.

22:51.120 --> 22:52.120
That's fun too.

22:52.120 --> 22:58.520
That's a fun luck of the draw thing where it's like, I hope I get gills in a dick.

22:58.520 --> 23:08.000
I prefer my mer parfait of just like, there's like a belly button scales, pee pee scales,

23:08.000 --> 23:10.760
knees scales.

23:10.760 --> 23:12.560
So did that help?

23:12.560 --> 23:13.880
Wow.

23:13.880 --> 23:18.080
We didn't even touch on the shit at all.

23:18.080 --> 23:19.080
Should we touch on this?

23:19.080 --> 23:21.680
I mean like- No, we good.

23:21.680 --> 23:24.200
Which of these two, Trev?

23:24.200 --> 23:25.200
This one.

23:25.200 --> 23:26.200
Yeah.

23:26.200 --> 23:27.200
This one's sending by level nine.

23:27.200 --> 23:28.600
Yeah, true, true, Drew Davenport.

23:28.600 --> 23:31.600
Thank you, Drew.

23:31.600 --> 23:41.840
This is by yadrewanswersuser Ahmad who asks, don't you wish that donkeys only existed in

23:41.840 --> 23:48.320
legends?

23:48.320 --> 23:52.800
Instead of wishing mythical creatures to be real, why not exile trouble making creatures

23:52.800 --> 23:58.280
into legends?

23:58.280 --> 24:02.640
I follow this question up to this point and then, like boneheaded donkeys wearing dress

24:02.640 --> 24:03.640
of humans.

24:03.640 --> 24:04.640
What?

24:04.640 --> 24:05.640
What?

24:05.640 --> 24:09.480
How often is that coming up?

24:09.480 --> 24:13.740
I just unlocked this because I read it earlier and I've just unlocked it.

24:13.740 --> 24:21.340
I think this person saw the movie franchise Shrek the movies and said, everything in this

24:21.340 --> 24:27.720
movie is fantasy bullshit and they're like, donkeys are real and he was like, yeah, right.

24:27.720 --> 24:31.720
They make super hairy horses that aren't as attractive.

24:31.720 --> 24:32.720
Sure.

24:32.720 --> 24:33.720
Yeah, right.

24:33.720 --> 24:34.720
Great.

24:34.720 --> 24:43.000
Do you think everybody sees a donkey in the hat and is like, no, not again.

24:43.000 --> 24:47.600
Do you wish that donkeys only existed in legends?

24:47.600 --> 24:55.400
The ideal for me would be if we could like exile donkeys to legend, but it would be like

24:55.400 --> 24:56.560
tomorrow.

24:56.560 --> 24:58.120
So like from this point forward.

24:58.120 --> 25:01.760
From this point forward, all donkeys are legend.

25:01.760 --> 25:06.000
Donkeys never exist, but donkeys did exist, but now they're legends.

25:06.000 --> 25:10.120
So when I have grandchildren, I can tell them about the donkeys.

25:10.120 --> 25:15.320
No, grandpa Paul, there was never a boneheaded donkey in people's dress.

25:15.320 --> 25:18.920
They were small, stupid horses.

25:18.920 --> 25:20.040
It's true.

25:20.040 --> 25:22.080
I never actually saw one myself.

25:22.080 --> 25:23.080
I never saw one.

25:23.080 --> 25:25.880
That's a good question, Travis.

25:25.880 --> 25:35.440
Listen, everybody out there, listen, I need you to pay attention for once and engage.

25:35.440 --> 25:43.200
If donkeys disappeared tomorrow, do you feel like you've appreciated donkeys now?

25:43.200 --> 25:49.560
In the arms of the donkey far away.

25:49.560 --> 25:53.460
I think when you all go home tonight, you'll really think twice about just walking past

25:53.460 --> 25:55.000
that donkey on your front lawn.

25:55.000 --> 25:56.000
Yeah.

25:56.000 --> 26:00.720
How many donkeys have you walked past just today and they have their little signs that

26:00.720 --> 26:05.040
are just hoof prints because they're donk, because they're donkeys.

26:05.040 --> 26:09.480
And you turn towards them and you held up your phone and you caught a ghastly on their

26:09.480 --> 26:11.760
fucking face.

26:11.760 --> 26:14.300
Let me tell you about a real life Pokemon friend of mine.

26:14.300 --> 26:19.400
It's called the American donkey.

26:19.400 --> 26:23.360
That's a donkey is a fun character from the show, my brother, my brother and me that we

26:23.360 --> 26:24.360
do.

26:24.360 --> 26:27.200
I mean, that is our IP.

26:27.200 --> 26:28.680
So you're going to be sued now.

26:28.680 --> 26:29.680
Yeah.

26:29.680 --> 26:30.680
In jail.

26:30.680 --> 26:33.680
Do you want another question?

26:33.680 --> 26:34.680
Yeah.

26:34.680 --> 26:35.680
Yeah.

26:35.680 --> 26:38.080
This one comes to us from Caroline.

26:38.080 --> 26:43.840
It says, dear brothers, I've moved in with my girlfriend and her family and overall things

26:43.840 --> 26:44.840
have been good.

26:44.840 --> 26:47.960
I get along with her whole family, but there's one issue.

26:47.960 --> 26:51.900
After years of living with roommates and buying individual food, I'm very defensive over my

26:51.900 --> 26:52.900
food.

26:52.900 --> 26:58.920
I know it's a shared household and I do eat some of their food, but I can't.

26:58.920 --> 27:01.400
We got to circle back on that one.

27:01.400 --> 27:05.020
But I can't help but be a little hurt when the lunch meats I bought Tuesday are gone

27:05.020 --> 27:06.020
by Thursday.

27:06.020 --> 27:09.440
How can I become less of a food hoarder with my new family?

27:09.440 --> 27:12.440
Carolyn, Carolyn, are you here?

27:12.440 --> 27:13.440
Hey Carolyn.

27:13.440 --> 27:14.440
Hey.

27:14.440 --> 27:15.440
Let me tell you where you lost me.

27:15.440 --> 27:16.440
Can you guess?

27:16.440 --> 27:17.440
Do you have the insight?

27:17.440 --> 27:18.440
Can you guess where you lost me?

27:18.440 --> 27:19.440
Let me help.

27:19.440 --> 27:26.760
It was when you said you did eat their food.

27:26.760 --> 27:30.080
I want to eat their things without having my things be eaten.

27:30.080 --> 27:35.080
Sincerely, a human representation of the United States of America.

27:35.080 --> 27:45.320
But no tea, no shade, no pink lemonade, we're just having fun up here, Caroline.

27:45.320 --> 27:46.320
I get it.

27:46.320 --> 27:47.320
Yeah.

27:47.320 --> 27:48.320
Yeah.

27:48.320 --> 27:49.320
I've done that.

27:49.320 --> 27:52.680
When I moved in with my wife at that time, my girlfriend, I would buy treats just for

27:52.680 --> 27:53.680
me.

27:53.680 --> 27:54.680
Yeah.

27:54.680 --> 27:55.680
I think that was going to be my idea.

27:55.680 --> 28:00.920
And I will also say in your corner, Tuesday to Thursday, that's a heavy lunch meat consumption

28:00.920 --> 28:02.600
that this household represents.

28:02.600 --> 28:05.200
There is a luxury monster in your house.

28:05.200 --> 28:07.680
Do you live with Chad from The Bachelorette?

28:07.680 --> 28:14.720
A lot of Chad fans in the fucking crowd tonight.

28:14.720 --> 28:17.640
He's a horribly abusive man and we should never applaud him.

28:17.640 --> 28:18.920
And he loves lunch meat.

28:18.920 --> 28:21.800
But boy does he love to eat lunch meat.

28:21.800 --> 28:23.320
And that's funny.

28:23.320 --> 28:25.580
But he's violent and horrible.

28:25.580 --> 28:26.580
And that's not.

28:26.580 --> 28:27.840
And that's not funny.

28:27.840 --> 28:32.200
But he eats lunch meat like it's Pringles, it's great.

28:32.200 --> 28:36.760
Um, hmm, there's nothing wrong with having secret food.

28:36.760 --> 28:40.400
You just got to have a good place to hide it.

28:40.400 --> 28:42.480
That's not good for frozen.

28:42.480 --> 28:43.880
It's not good for frozen.

28:43.880 --> 28:44.880
That's right.

28:44.880 --> 28:45.880
You can't hide your frozen.

28:45.880 --> 28:52.040
Going grocery shopping with Travis is like going grocery shopping with an old prospector.

28:52.040 --> 28:55.040
You got to get your frozen.

28:55.040 --> 28:56.880
You got to get some Vittles.

28:56.880 --> 29:02.560
You got to get your secret soup.

29:02.560 --> 29:06.120
You got to get your greenie meanies.

29:06.120 --> 29:07.440
And your flapjack makings.

29:07.440 --> 29:15.400
Your flapjack makings and your porkums.

29:15.400 --> 29:17.200
Limes.

29:17.200 --> 29:18.200
For scurvy?

29:18.200 --> 29:19.200
For scurvy.

29:19.200 --> 29:20.200
Yeah.

29:20.200 --> 29:21.200
For all the prospectors scurvy.

29:21.200 --> 29:22.200
You got to get your red buddies.

29:22.200 --> 29:25.200
Are you talking about apples or tomatoes?

29:25.200 --> 29:26.200
Yes.

29:26.200 --> 29:28.440
You got to get your brown friends.

29:28.440 --> 29:33.120
All the red foods you can handle scares the mountain ghosts away.

29:33.120 --> 29:34.440
Did you mean mountain goat?

29:34.440 --> 29:36.640
What are you fucking talking about?

29:36.640 --> 29:37.960
Are you even a prospector?

29:37.960 --> 29:39.800
Are you doing research for a part?

29:39.800 --> 29:42.460
Are you, are you Jared Leto?

29:42.460 --> 29:45.200
You have to tell me legally if you're Jared Leto.

29:45.200 --> 29:46.200
Um.

29:46.200 --> 29:51.640
We got a lot of Leto heads.

29:51.640 --> 29:52.640
Yeah.

29:52.640 --> 29:53.640
Leto fiends.

29:53.640 --> 29:54.640
We've been going maybe like a half hour.

29:54.640 --> 29:55.640
When should we do audience questions?

29:55.640 --> 29:56.640
Uh.

29:56.640 --> 29:57.640
I know you got one more Yahoo.

29:57.640 --> 29:58.640
I got one more Yahoo.

29:58.640 --> 29:59.640
I thought you were.

29:59.640 --> 30:00.640
I just want to send them by.

30:00.640 --> 30:04.680
I just want to send them by Riding High and Zoe Kinsey again.

30:04.680 --> 30:05.680
Thank you Zoe.

30:05.680 --> 30:10.600
Yahoo answers user Joey asks.

30:10.600 --> 30:15.160
What extreme unreasonable things would you do just for one slice of piping hot Chicago

30:15.160 --> 30:20.280
style pizza?

30:20.280 --> 30:23.000
It's a weird exchange race.

30:23.000 --> 30:28.400
I mean I have an extreme unreasonable thing I do whenever I have one slice of piping hot

30:28.400 --> 30:39.360
Chicago style pizza and that is have diarrhea for three days.

30:39.360 --> 30:41.180
I got to play the local crowd.

30:41.180 --> 30:48.280
My favorite pizza chain is actually the Canadian Boston Pizza.

30:48.280 --> 30:52.200
What situation are you running into where someone's like hey do you want this pizza

30:52.200 --> 30:53.200
pizza?

30:53.200 --> 30:54.200
Prove it.

30:54.200 --> 30:58.720
How much does it cost to fly to Chicago?

30:58.720 --> 31:01.080
That's like that's the furthest you should ever go.

31:01.080 --> 31:02.080
Yeah.

31:02.080 --> 31:03.080
Cause it's literally everywhere.

31:03.080 --> 31:07.520
If it's like I would pay $400 it's like you could pay $300 and get to O'Hare and snatch

31:07.520 --> 31:10.040
that za.

31:10.040 --> 31:12.040
If you're in Chicago you shouldn't do anything.

31:12.040 --> 31:13.720
You should just go get some of it.

31:13.720 --> 31:14.720
Just go get some.

31:14.720 --> 31:19.720
That should inexplicably need Chicago style pizza.

31:19.720 --> 31:20.720
You should just.

31:20.720 --> 31:21.720
Have the stuff.

31:21.720 --> 31:22.720
Just have some.

31:22.720 --> 31:23.720
Yeah.

31:23.720 --> 31:28.320
The furthest most unreasonable thing you should do is teach yourself how to make it.

31:28.320 --> 31:34.280
Do you think the great Chicago fire was somebody just like I got to get me that za.

31:34.280 --> 31:35.280
That would have been ill-advised.

31:35.280 --> 31:36.280
Yeah.

31:36.280 --> 31:39.320
Ah beans I burn all pizza town down.

31:39.320 --> 31:42.160
There isn't any pizza here.

31:42.160 --> 31:45.360
Oh sorry you guys never lived in Chicago so there's this dope part of town called Pizza

31:45.360 --> 31:46.360
Town.

31:46.360 --> 31:48.360
It's right next to Roscoe Village.

31:48.360 --> 31:49.640
It's sick.

31:49.640 --> 31:51.400
The streets are literally pizza.

31:51.400 --> 31:54.840
It's actually horrible and disgusting.

31:54.840 --> 31:57.400
When there's potholes just grease pools up.

31:57.400 --> 32:03.000
It's really really horrible.

32:03.000 --> 32:04.560
And it's like an ice nine situation.

32:04.560 --> 32:12.440
If you touch the pizza you turn into pizza and die.

32:12.440 --> 32:13.440
I think we're ready for audience questions.

32:13.440 --> 32:14.440
Yeah.

32:14.440 --> 32:15.440
Can we get some house lights.

32:15.440 --> 32:16.440
Please don't line up.

32:16.440 --> 32:17.440
It's not a TED talk.

32:17.440 --> 32:25.040
This just came in so hot.

32:25.040 --> 32:28.160
This is breaking news that comes fresh on my phone.

32:28.160 --> 32:31.880
We've got a haunted doll watch.

32:31.880 --> 32:32.880
You take him back down.

32:32.880 --> 32:33.880
No house lights.

32:33.880 --> 32:35.240
Justin's a liar.

32:35.240 --> 32:36.240
We pranked you.

32:36.240 --> 32:37.240
That was a fun.

32:37.240 --> 32:38.240
Bring the house lights down.

32:38.240 --> 32:39.240
Hold on.

32:39.240 --> 32:40.240
Sorry.

32:40.240 --> 32:41.240
This just came in so fucking.

32:41.240 --> 32:42.240
I got a notification.

32:42.240 --> 32:43.240
This is a hot haunted doll.

32:43.240 --> 32:44.240
Haunted doll.

32:44.240 --> 32:45.240
Gonna go fast.

32:45.240 --> 32:46.240
Gonna go fast.

32:46.240 --> 32:47.760
Haunted doll called Hunter.

32:47.760 --> 32:48.760
Haunted doll.

32:48.760 --> 32:49.760
Active.

32:49.760 --> 32:50.760
Don't even sweat it.

32:50.760 --> 32:51.760
Sunshine Maquia.

32:51.760 --> 32:53.820
And it says again here on the listing.

32:53.820 --> 32:54.820
Active.

32:54.820 --> 32:57.800
I'm gonna ask my brother Travis one of the most notable things about this listing of

32:57.800 --> 32:59.560
a haunted doll on eBay.

32:59.560 --> 33:03.960
Travis, why don't you tell me the backdrop that they've chosen for haunted doll Maquia?

33:03.960 --> 33:07.320
It's like $100 bills.

33:07.320 --> 33:08.320
Yeah.

33:08.320 --> 33:11.400
It's just lots of haunted dollar bills.

33:11.400 --> 33:14.160
It's just so fucking fresh.

33:14.160 --> 33:17.560
I don't know how to doll who's also a baller.

33:17.560 --> 33:18.680
The most balling thing.

33:18.680 --> 33:20.040
This is my favorite doll.

33:20.040 --> 33:22.160
I call her Sunshine Makiya.

33:22.160 --> 33:24.680
She is the spirit of a spunky eight year old.

33:24.680 --> 33:27.060
She brings a sense of brightness to any room.

33:27.060 --> 33:28.720
You will need that after thinking about

33:28.720 --> 33:29.680
an eight year old dying.

33:29.680 --> 33:30.740
So it's refreshing.

33:30.740 --> 33:34.360
It's good that the doll brings that lightness to any room.

33:34.360 --> 33:35.680
She laughs and sings.

33:35.680 --> 33:37.960
She doesn't, she's a doll.

33:37.960 --> 33:42.760
And turns night lights on, that's okay.

33:42.760 --> 33:47.480
And off, well that's, that's earth conscious of her.

33:47.480 --> 33:48.920
It's very eco-friendly.

33:49.800 --> 33:52.840
She wants to bring happiness to a family

33:52.840 --> 33:55.720
who doesn't care about their electric bills presumably.

33:55.720 --> 33:58.240
And here's the thing about Sunshine Makiya,

33:58.240 --> 34:00.620
she needs help finding the light.

34:00.620 --> 34:04.240
And she did get her picture taken in front of several.

34:04.240 --> 34:05.200
A million dollars.

34:05.200 --> 34:06.800
Like a million dollars, so she can afford it.

34:06.800 --> 34:08.320
Anyway, that's Haunted Doll Watch.

34:08.320 --> 34:09.160
Now we.

34:09.160 --> 34:10.840
That's a little thing just for you.

34:10.840 --> 34:12.600
Hey everybody, we want to take a quick break

34:12.600 --> 34:17.160
from this live extravaganza of this

34:17.160 --> 34:21.400
physical manifestation of joy and acceptance

34:21.400 --> 34:24.200
to tell you about some of our sponsors this week.

34:24.200 --> 34:26.280
Yeah, Travis isn't here because we,

34:26.280 --> 34:28.200
ah dang it, Kevin!

34:28.200 --> 34:29.240
We left him in Boston.

34:29.240 --> 34:31.520
And also we called him Kevin.

34:31.520 --> 34:32.920
And that's probably why we lost him.

34:32.920 --> 34:33.920
We were like, Kevin, you ready to go?

34:33.920 --> 34:36.460
And nobody answered, so we just got on the fucking plane.

34:36.460 --> 34:37.300
Well, there we know.

34:37.300 --> 34:39.120
Travis did not change his name to Kevin.

34:39.120 --> 34:40.920
It's still just Travis.

34:40.920 --> 34:42.840
What if one of the parents of that movie did

34:42.840 --> 34:44.200
definitely see he was still asleep?

34:44.200 --> 34:46.360
He's like, I can't fucking deal with Kevin.

34:46.360 --> 34:47.200
I can't.

34:47.200 --> 34:48.240
I'll figure this out later.

34:48.240 --> 34:49.760
This fucking pizza monster.

34:49.760 --> 34:51.200
Always demanding his own pizzas.

34:51.200 --> 34:52.320
I hate this kid.

34:52.320 --> 34:54.480
You are, you're getting homed alone.

34:55.440 --> 34:58.640
Our sponsor this week is Harry's.

34:58.640 --> 35:00.920
They have supported us for so long.

35:00.920 --> 35:02.480
And let me ask you a question.

35:02.480 --> 35:06.180
Have you wondered why all the razors are behind glass?

35:06.180 --> 35:08.480
I just thought it was because they did crimes.

35:08.480 --> 35:10.400
And so they were in razor jail,

35:10.400 --> 35:12.400
the most dangerous jail of all.

35:12.400 --> 35:13.640
They're not in razor jail.

35:13.640 --> 35:15.760
In razor jail, you don't get cut.

35:15.760 --> 35:18.800
You cut, do the cutting.

35:18.800 --> 35:19.960
Yeah.

35:19.960 --> 35:22.000
No, it's because they're so flipping expensive.

35:22.000 --> 35:23.160
They're really, really pricey.

35:23.160 --> 35:24.360
But you don't have to worry about that.

35:24.360 --> 35:25.580
That's not your problem anymore.

35:25.580 --> 35:27.400
That's the rubes problem.

35:27.400 --> 35:29.920
No, you are gonna start shopping at Harry's.

35:29.920 --> 35:32.600
These are German engineered five blade cartridges

35:32.600 --> 35:34.400
that provide a close, comfortable shave.

35:34.400 --> 35:35.440
And the quality is guaranteed.

35:35.440 --> 35:36.920
If you don't like them, I bet you will.

35:36.920 --> 35:38.680
But if you don't, you get a full refund.

35:38.680 --> 35:41.500
And these are at half the price of the leading brand

35:41.500 --> 35:43.880
because these are like factory direct prices.

35:43.880 --> 35:45.320
I wanna tell you about the Truman Starter Set.

35:45.320 --> 35:46.720
It's a great option for new customers.

35:46.720 --> 35:47.560
It's an amazing deal.

35:47.560 --> 35:49.560
Just 15 bucks, you get a razor handle.

35:49.560 --> 35:50.880
You get moisturizing shave cream

35:50.880 --> 35:52.680
and you get three of Harry's five blade,

35:52.680 --> 35:54.220
German engineered razors.

35:54.220 --> 35:56.320
They're gonna give our listeners five bucks off

35:56.320 --> 35:59.800
that Starter Set with your first purchase

35:59.800 --> 36:02.320
at H-A-R-R-Y-S.com.

36:02.320 --> 36:04.160
That's Harry's.com and use the promo code,

36:04.160 --> 36:05.560
my brother, all one word,

36:05.560 --> 36:07.700
and get that dope Starter Set for 10 bucks.

36:07.700 --> 36:09.640
Again, that's H-A-R-R-Y-S.

36:09.640 --> 36:11.840
Make sure you use that promo code, my brother.

36:11.840 --> 36:14.080
I also wanna tell you about MeUndies.

36:14.080 --> 36:15.800
MeUndies.com slash my brother

36:15.800 --> 36:17.920
is gonna be the address for this one.

36:17.920 --> 36:21.040
Listen, if you are wearing underwear right now

36:21.040 --> 36:23.840
and they aren't MeUndies, you're cheating your nuts.

36:23.840 --> 36:26.360
Or your vagina.

36:26.360 --> 36:27.840
Vagina or a non-binary.

36:27.840 --> 36:28.800
I don't know what you got in there.

36:28.800 --> 36:30.600
It's none of my fucking business.

36:30.600 --> 36:32.760
The important thing is you gotta cradle it.

36:32.760 --> 36:35.960
And the only thing to cradle your non-specific genitalia.

36:35.960 --> 36:39.320
Every pair of MeUndies is made from sustainably sourced modal.

36:39.320 --> 36:40.160
What's modal?

36:40.160 --> 36:43.040
Well, it's a fabric that's twice as soft as cotton.

36:43.040 --> 36:44.400
It shouldn't exist.

36:44.400 --> 36:45.680
It should not exist.

36:45.680 --> 36:48.180
It's a crime against God.

36:48.180 --> 36:50.000
And every month I got new styles.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
We get the new styles in the mirror.

36:52.000 --> 36:55.680
This one's flavor is inspired by my Miami Beach.

36:55.680 --> 36:57.360
You know that's my vibe.

36:57.360 --> 36:59.280
Yeah, the styles are very, very fresh.

36:59.280 --> 37:00.120
I get very excited.

37:00.120 --> 37:02.560
It's the most stylish clothes I wear

37:02.560 --> 37:04.280
and most people don't get to see it.

37:04.280 --> 37:06.840
Just analyze.

37:06.840 --> 37:09.040
Shipping is free in the U.S. and Canada.

37:09.040 --> 37:11.280
And you can, that one's terrible.

37:11.280 --> 37:13.440
You can save up to $8.

37:13.440 --> 37:15.960
It's like, that's Borat's last words.

37:15.960 --> 37:19.960
My man, my boy, my wife.

37:19.960 --> 37:21.900
You can save up to $8 a pair

37:21.900 --> 37:23.440
with the MeUndies subscription plan.

37:23.440 --> 37:25.000
Get the plan, get a pair.

37:25.000 --> 37:27.020
Either way, you get 20% off your first order

37:27.020 --> 37:29.340
when you go to MeUndies.com slash my brother.

37:29.340 --> 37:32.300
That is MeUndies.com slash my brother

37:32.300 --> 37:34.560
for 20% off your first order.

37:34.560 --> 37:36.680
Got a Jumbotron here.

37:36.680 --> 37:39.640
This message is for Katie and it's from Edbury

37:39.640 --> 37:41.960
who says, it's almost Valentine's Day.

37:41.960 --> 37:43.480
Oh no.

37:43.480 --> 37:45.920
But the Max One calendar says it'll be more like July.

37:45.920 --> 37:46.760
Yes. Yes.

37:46.760 --> 37:47.880
When the brothers read this.

37:47.880 --> 37:49.040
Uh-huh.

37:49.040 --> 37:50.760
We've only been seeing each other for a few weeks

37:50.760 --> 37:52.640
so this is either going to be,

37:52.640 --> 37:55.480
this is either going to make future Katie's day

37:55.480 --> 37:59.260
or be incredibly awkward for both of us separately.

37:59.260 --> 38:00.600
Even if things don't pan out,

38:00.600 --> 38:03.360
you definitely deserve a V-Day surprise this summer.

38:03.360 --> 38:05.480
Holy shit. Oh shit.

38:05.480 --> 38:07.560
Please email right this second

38:07.560 --> 38:09.960
and let us know which it is because I have to know.

38:09.960 --> 38:12.720
I'm actually okay with the sort of Schrodinger's cat

38:12.720 --> 38:14.080
situation. Okay, okay.

38:15.600 --> 38:16.920
Schrodinger's relationship.

38:16.920 --> 38:18.880
Yeah, this is really wonderful

38:18.880 --> 38:23.660
and best of luck for your relationship

38:23.660 --> 38:25.240
over the past five months, I guess.

38:25.240 --> 38:26.060
That's applicable.

38:26.060 --> 38:27.120
Best of luck to you two.

38:27.120 --> 38:28.080
Yeah. To both of you.

38:28.080 --> 38:29.120
Best of luck.

38:29.120 --> 38:31.120
And one, oh, do you want to do this one?

38:31.120 --> 38:32.160
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

38:32.160 --> 38:34.680
It's a message for Faye slash mom

38:34.680 --> 38:35.880
and it's from Jake and Max.

38:35.880 --> 38:38.600
So maybe, maybe she's Faye to one of them

38:38.600 --> 38:39.480
and mom to the other.

38:39.480 --> 38:40.960
I don't know exactly what the breakdown is.

38:40.960 --> 38:42.240
Well, that's revealed in literally

38:42.240 --> 38:43.680
the first sentence of the message.

38:43.680 --> 38:46.120
Happy birthday to the mess mom and partner.

38:46.120 --> 38:48.720
Try that again because you did say mess mom and that's.

38:48.720 --> 38:53.720
I am mess mom, welcome to my comic strip.

38:53.800 --> 38:56.740
It's very long running and poorly read.

38:56.740 --> 39:00.280
Happy birthday to the best mom, not mess mom

39:00.280 --> 39:03.920
and partner from your best family and favorite brothers.

39:03.920 --> 39:06.020
May your year be full of geeky wonders

39:06.020 --> 39:07.040
and boundless adventure.

39:07.040 --> 39:10.240
Also stop listening to the adventure zone without Jake.

39:10.240 --> 39:12.360
The brothers command it.

39:12.360 --> 39:14.880
Now your birthday was April 6th

39:14.880 --> 39:17.600
and we're very sorry about that Faye mom, mess mom.

39:17.600 --> 39:21.360
But you have heard this message now.

39:21.360 --> 39:22.200
Yeah.

39:22.200 --> 39:23.120
So it's a fish.

39:23.120 --> 39:26.360
Just remember it on your next birthday, I guess.

39:26.360 --> 39:28.720
Thank you all the folks who came out to Boston.

39:28.720 --> 39:33.500
It was seriously like the wildest, wettest crowd

39:33.500 --> 39:35.760
like we've probably ever had.

39:35.760 --> 39:37.600
It was, yeah, it was wet and wild.

39:37.600 --> 39:38.440
It was so good.

39:38.440 --> 39:40.080
Thank you everybody at the Wilbur theater

39:40.080 --> 39:40.920
for being so great.

39:40.920 --> 39:42.680
Thank you to Kelsey who helped us,

39:42.680 --> 39:44.760
who managed this show for us.

39:44.760 --> 39:46.560
I wanna say something real quick.

39:46.560 --> 39:50.520
Just wanna remind everybody that we are doing a card game.

39:51.500 --> 39:55.840
It is an expansion of the card game monikers.

39:55.840 --> 39:57.080
If you don't know monikers,

39:57.080 --> 39:59.960
it's a great card game that's basically

39:59.960 --> 40:03.920
like an expanded re-imagined version of charades

40:03.920 --> 40:06.140
is perhaps the best way of explaining it.

40:06.140 --> 40:07.840
But we've got an expansion of it.

40:07.840 --> 40:10.060
It's 112 cards.

40:10.060 --> 40:12.280
Every one of them is a reference to something

40:12.280 --> 40:13.760
in one of our podcasts,

40:13.760 --> 40:16.120
but they're not just like in-jokey references.

40:16.120 --> 40:20.360
This is something you can play with everybody.

40:20.360 --> 40:22.660
You can share with the whole family.

40:22.660 --> 40:26.400
Seriously, it's my favorite party game right now.

40:26.400 --> 40:29.360
It has replaced a lot of the other party games

40:29.360 --> 40:30.240
that we used to play.

40:30.240 --> 40:33.560
And every time we go on a trip with our friends,

40:33.560 --> 40:35.240
we bring it and play it every single time.

40:35.240 --> 40:36.560
And it's hard to get a lot of the times.

40:36.560 --> 40:38.240
A lot of times it's like sold out places

40:38.240 --> 40:39.680
because it's really hard to get.

40:39.680 --> 40:41.040
I waited for months to get my copy,

40:41.040 --> 40:42.280
but you're not gonna have to do that.

40:42.280 --> 40:44.280
If you wanna get just our collection

40:44.280 --> 40:46.940
that we hand wrote every single card in this bad boy,

40:46.940 --> 40:50.580
it's $10 to pre-order and we're only doing pre-orders.

40:50.580 --> 40:51.800
Once that's over, that's it.

40:51.800 --> 40:53.080
We gotta stress that this time,

40:53.080 --> 40:55.300
like this thing's gonna be available for pre-order

40:55.300 --> 40:56.180
for a few more weeks.

40:56.180 --> 40:57.020
And then after that,

40:57.020 --> 40:59.080
it will not be available just to purchase.

40:59.080 --> 41:00.800
The only way that we can get it in your hands

41:00.800 --> 41:01.640
is if you pre-order it.

41:01.640 --> 41:05.160
So please do not sleep and ask us like a month from now

41:05.160 --> 41:06.160
how you can get it.

41:06.160 --> 41:07.880
And if you don't have the game, that's okay.

41:07.880 --> 41:10.720
Like half of the pre-orders have been,

41:10.720 --> 41:13.800
you can pre-order it with the actual game for 35 bucks.

41:13.800 --> 41:16.040
And about half the pre-orders have been that.

41:16.040 --> 41:17.600
So that's a lot of people getting in the monikers

41:17.600 --> 41:20.400
and you're going to have so much fun with it.

41:20.400 --> 41:23.040
And it's really, really, really, really cool.

41:23.040 --> 41:24.200
And we're really proud of it.

41:24.200 --> 41:25.560
We worked really hard on it.

41:25.560 --> 41:27.520
Also a portion of the sales are gonna go

41:27.520 --> 41:29.640
to benefit Grow Huntington,

41:29.640 --> 41:33.360
which is a, it's a urban farm

41:33.360 --> 41:37.120
that's going to be helping people in addiction recovery.

41:37.120 --> 41:40.400
And I'm really excited about the project.

41:40.400 --> 41:43.120
They just got their land and they're trying to pay for it.

41:43.120 --> 41:44.320
So by buying this collection,

41:44.320 --> 41:45.760
you're actually gonna be helping to do that.

41:45.760 --> 41:50.320
The address is mackleroycollection.com.

41:50.320 --> 41:52.040
Mackleroycollection.com.

41:52.040 --> 41:53.960
Please, you have 23 days left.

41:53.960 --> 41:54.880
Please don't sleep.

41:54.880 --> 41:57.260
Go and pre-order right this second.

41:58.160 --> 42:00.040
Thanks to Maximum Fun for having us on the network.

42:00.040 --> 42:01.360
Just go to maximumfun.org

42:01.360 --> 42:03.080
and listen to all the podcasts they have on there.

42:03.080 --> 42:04.380
They're all fucking fantastic.

42:04.380 --> 42:06.040
We have other shows that we do.

42:06.040 --> 42:07.680
You can find all those at Mackle Roy shows.

42:07.680 --> 42:10.040
You can also find contact info for us there.

42:10.040 --> 42:11.720
Thanks to John Roderick and the Long Winters

42:11.720 --> 42:12.560
for the use of our theme song.

42:12.560 --> 42:14.640
It's a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

42:14.640 --> 42:17.880
And seriously, again, everybody who came to our Boston shows

42:17.880 --> 42:19.640
and who was involved in the production of the Boston shows,

42:19.640 --> 42:20.480
thank you.

42:20.480 --> 42:21.400
It was like, it was the best,

42:21.400 --> 42:25.620
like it was one of the best weekends like of my life.

42:25.620 --> 42:27.700
The My Bim Bam show was so much fun.

42:27.700 --> 42:30.040
The Adventure Zone was like, holy shit,

42:30.040 --> 42:31.880
like mind-blowingly great.

42:33.080 --> 42:33.920
Just thank you all.

42:33.920 --> 42:34.760
Thanks.

42:34.760 --> 42:35.580
Thank you.

42:35.580 --> 42:36.420
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

42:36.420 --> 42:38.360
Now back to the show.

42:40.860 --> 42:42.760
You guys, I'm so excited to introduce to you

42:42.760 --> 42:45.760
my new baby, Getting Curious with Jonathan Van Ness.

42:45.760 --> 42:47.440
This is gonna be a really fun look

42:47.440 --> 42:48.960
at things that I find curious,

42:48.960 --> 42:50.800
whether it's a menstrual cup,

42:50.800 --> 42:52.320
it might be the Romanov family,

42:52.320 --> 42:55.040
it might be fracking, it could be Carly Fiorina.

42:55.040 --> 42:55.880
I don't even know.

42:55.880 --> 42:56.700
Who knows?

42:56.700 --> 42:57.800
It's gonna be whatever I think is interesting.

42:57.800 --> 42:59.940
I can't wait to bring it to you guys.

42:59.940 --> 43:01.440
We're gonna be bringing in content experts.

43:01.440 --> 43:02.840
I'm gonna be learning the things.

43:02.840 --> 43:04.560
It's only gonna take about 30 minutes

43:04.560 --> 43:06.720
for you to expand your baby brains with me

43:06.720 --> 43:08.040
and have a super fun time.

43:08.040 --> 43:09.040
So I can't wait to see you

43:09.040 --> 43:11.160
on our first episode of Getting Curious.

43:13.920 --> 43:15.240
Okay, now can we get house lights up?

43:15.240 --> 43:17.400
Sorry, we're the fucking worst.

43:17.400 --> 43:19.480
Listen, I'm at the whim of the app.

43:19.480 --> 43:20.320
Let's see here.

43:20.320 --> 43:21.640
Let's go a little bit more.

43:21.640 --> 43:22.480
Can we get more house lights?

43:22.480 --> 43:23.320
A little bit more.

43:23.320 --> 43:24.140
A little bit more.

43:24.140 --> 43:24.980
Yeah, a little bit more.

43:24.980 --> 43:25.800
Now that doesn't help.

43:25.800 --> 43:27.640
Wait, wait, wait, hold on, wait.

43:27.640 --> 43:28.480
I'm gonna say.

43:28.480 --> 43:29.300
In the back of the...

43:29.300 --> 43:30.140
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

43:30.140 --> 43:31.320
Two hands up right here.

43:31.320 --> 43:32.160
Blonde hair, yes.

43:32.160 --> 43:33.000
You.

43:33.000 --> 43:33.820
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

43:33.820 --> 43:34.660
Come on down.

43:34.660 --> 43:35.500
Yes, you got it.

43:35.500 --> 43:36.320
Yes, come on down.

43:36.320 --> 43:37.160
Wait, yes.

43:37.160 --> 43:38.000
Yes.

43:38.000 --> 43:38.820
Hi.

43:38.820 --> 43:39.660
Yes, you're doing it.

43:39.660 --> 43:40.500
Hello.

43:40.500 --> 43:41.320
Where's the mic?

43:41.320 --> 43:42.160
Where's the mic?

43:42.160 --> 43:43.000
Wait, no, no, I think...

43:43.000 --> 43:48.000
Oh, shit.

43:48.000 --> 43:49.000
Wait, wait, where's the mic?

43:49.000 --> 43:49.820
Oh, God.

43:49.820 --> 43:50.660
Hey, hold on a second.

43:50.660 --> 43:53.880
Hold on, wait, we lost the microphone.

43:53.880 --> 43:54.900
I thought we had a floor mic.

43:54.900 --> 43:55.740
Hold on one second.

43:55.740 --> 43:58.160
Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.

43:58.160 --> 43:59.000
So...

43:59.000 --> 44:05.340
Okay, but seriously, there's a Hamburglar for microphones

44:05.340 --> 44:06.920
somewhere in the crowd.

44:06.920 --> 44:07.740
Which is a fun bit.

44:07.740 --> 44:08.580
His name is Clint McElroy.

44:08.580 --> 44:12.200
Somebody's like, hell yeah, I'm gonna get a free mic.

44:12.200 --> 44:14.020
That's a weird reaction to that.

44:14.020 --> 44:14.860
Hi, what's your name?

44:14.860 --> 44:15.920
Hi, I'm Sandra.

44:15.920 --> 44:16.760
Hi, Sandra.

44:16.760 --> 44:17.600
Hello, Sandra.

44:17.600 --> 44:18.420
Sandra, what's up?

44:18.420 --> 44:19.260
Are you gonna have any...

44:19.260 --> 44:20.100
Are you thinking about maybe a bummer tonight,

44:20.100 --> 44:20.920
or what are you...

44:20.920 --> 44:21.760
No, no, no, no bummers.

44:21.760 --> 44:22.600
Great, great, great.

44:22.600 --> 44:23.420
Okay, no bummers.

44:23.420 --> 44:24.260
Okay, great.

44:24.260 --> 44:25.460
Can we get a little more Sandra in our ears, please?

44:25.460 --> 44:27.660
Crank up the knob that says Sandra back there.

44:27.660 --> 44:28.620
Do you have a Sandra knob?

44:28.620 --> 44:30.500
Can you give me like 70% more Sandra?

44:30.500 --> 44:32.300
Hey, is there any more Sandra you could provide?

44:32.300 --> 44:33.460
Waitin' on the Sandra.

44:33.460 --> 44:35.960
Waitin' on the Sandra drop.

44:35.960 --> 44:39.320
I can't get any Sandra on my left.

44:39.320 --> 44:40.160
Hey.

44:40.160 --> 44:41.000
So, hey, what's up, brother?

44:41.000 --> 44:42.360
How are you doing?

44:42.360 --> 44:43.600
I'm super drunk, but...

44:43.600 --> 44:44.420
All right.

44:44.420 --> 44:45.260
Yeah.

44:45.260 --> 44:46.100
Yeah.

44:46.100 --> 44:46.920
Yeah.

44:46.920 --> 44:47.760
Yeah.

44:47.760 --> 44:48.600
Yeah.

44:48.600 --> 44:49.420
Yeah.

44:49.420 --> 44:50.260
Yeah.

44:50.260 --> 44:51.800
So, I actually sent this in,

44:51.800 --> 44:54.000
but I wanted to like really drive it home.

44:54.000 --> 44:55.320
It's not a bummer, I promise.

44:55.320 --> 44:56.160
Okay.

44:56.160 --> 44:58.160
So, my friend just said she's pregnant.

44:58.160 --> 44:59.000
Cool.

44:59.000 --> 44:59.820
And if it's a girl,

44:59.820 --> 45:01.220
cause I know you guys are dads or about to be dads.

45:01.220 --> 45:02.060
Yeah.

45:02.060 --> 45:02.900
And if it's a girl,

45:02.900 --> 45:05.560
she wants to name her Winslow hyphen Stephanie.

45:05.560 --> 45:06.400
So, like...

45:06.400 --> 45:11.400
So, either A, how do I help this future small person,

45:18.160 --> 45:20.700
or B, when is a good age to tell them

45:20.700 --> 45:22.060
to pack up and move away?

45:23.860 --> 45:24.700
Good question.

45:24.700 --> 45:26.660
Winslow, okay.

45:26.660 --> 45:28.360
Winslow, correct me if I'm wrong,

45:28.360 --> 45:30.860
but Winslow hyphen Stephanie sounds like

45:30.860 --> 45:34.460
somebody named Stephanie bought a bar called the Winslow.

45:34.460 --> 45:36.960
And she's like, well, people won't know where to come,

45:36.960 --> 45:38.560
but I do want my name on it.

45:38.560 --> 45:41.360
I'm gonna call it Winslow hyphen Stephanie.

45:41.360 --> 45:44.700
Without giving a last name, what's the last initial?

45:44.700 --> 45:45.620
S.

45:45.620 --> 45:46.460
Okay.

45:46.460 --> 45:48.660
Hmm, that's just nothing for us.

45:48.660 --> 45:50.660
I just wanna make sure it wouldn't end up being like,

45:50.660 --> 45:52.020
Winslow Williams.

45:52.020 --> 45:52.860
If it was a...

45:52.860 --> 45:54.820
Hey, Travis, what would have been the funny letter?

45:54.820 --> 45:55.660
W.

45:55.660 --> 45:57.820
Okay, W, okay, got it.

45:57.820 --> 46:01.060
If it had been a boy, would they have named them?

46:01.060 --> 46:03.400
I think Winslow's still on the table, if it's a boy.

46:03.400 --> 46:04.500
Oh, okay.

46:04.500 --> 46:06.860
I was gonna make a Carl Winslow joke,

46:06.860 --> 46:09.720
but the construction of it would have been extremely tedious.

46:09.720 --> 46:14.720
I will say, I recently watched a clip from the hit show,

46:15.060 --> 46:19.260
Family Matters, and Reginald L. Johnson

46:19.260 --> 46:21.260
delivered quite the performance

46:21.260 --> 46:24.160
when challenging some real jerks.

46:24.160 --> 46:25.600
And I'm down with it.

46:25.600 --> 46:27.000
I shot a kid.

46:27.000 --> 46:30.860
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

46:30.860 --> 46:34.460
Carl Winslow never shot a kid that I can remember.

46:34.460 --> 46:36.460
I shot a kid.

46:36.460 --> 46:39.560
Still the best delivery of any line of movie history.

46:39.560 --> 46:42.860
Sorry, that has nothing to do with what you've asked.

46:42.860 --> 46:45.500
It's not the best name, but you know what?

46:47.060 --> 46:47.900
I don't know what.

46:47.900 --> 46:49.800
There wasn't an end to that sentence.

46:49.800 --> 46:51.500
It's not the worst ever.

46:51.500 --> 46:53.660
Does it change anything that they only wanna name her

46:53.660 --> 46:56.360
Winslow so they can call her Winnie?

46:56.360 --> 46:59.060
There's so many other shortcuts to that, though.

46:59.060 --> 47:00.620
I know, that's what I told her.

47:00.620 --> 47:03.420
They're thinking, why not just go with her Winnie?

47:03.420 --> 47:04.260
Yeah.

47:04.260 --> 47:05.100
That's what I said.

47:05.100 --> 47:06.560
I swear to you, that's what I told her,

47:06.560 --> 47:08.220
but she said, no, Winslow's prettier.

47:08.220 --> 47:11.120
I'm gonna go with Winnebago hyphen Billabong.

47:11.120 --> 47:11.960
Why?

47:11.960 --> 47:13.120
You super don't.

47:15.500 --> 47:18.420
Winslow, okay, if Winslow's prettier than Winnie,

47:18.420 --> 47:20.160
guess what they shouldn't do?

47:20.160 --> 47:21.120
Name her Winnie?

47:21.120 --> 47:22.260
Correct.

47:22.260 --> 47:23.800
Why would they call her Winnie

47:23.800 --> 47:25.560
if they think Winslow is prettier?

47:25.560 --> 47:26.400
That's okay, you caught on.

47:26.400 --> 47:29.960
Also, does it change anything that her husband hates it?

47:29.960 --> 47:30.800
Then hold on.

47:30.800 --> 47:32.800
Then wait, that's not a good arrangement, then.

47:32.800 --> 47:34.100
Yeah, it seems like something's broken down there.

47:34.100 --> 47:35.860
He's kind of whipped, I don't know if that's okay.

47:35.860 --> 47:36.700
Okay, okay, you've gone beyond our energies.

47:36.700 --> 47:38.160
Then you've asked the wrong question.

47:38.160 --> 47:39.600
The question you wanna ask is,

47:39.600 --> 47:41.800
how do you get her husband to really step up

47:41.800 --> 47:43.200
and shut this shit down?

47:43.200 --> 47:45.360
It's, for under any other circumstances.

47:45.360 --> 47:46.500
As per usual, Travis, you're right.

47:46.500 --> 47:47.760
Yeah.

47:47.760 --> 47:49.460
I hope that helped.

47:49.460 --> 47:50.300
Did that help?

47:50.300 --> 47:51.120
All right, cool.

47:51.120 --> 47:52.600
Okay, who's gonna take Sandra's place?

47:52.600 --> 47:53.420
Yeah, okay.

47:53.420 --> 47:54.360
Hold on, wait, wait, wait.

47:54.360 --> 47:55.800
We got a microphone coming down.

47:55.800 --> 47:56.620
Oh, excellent, thank you.

47:56.620 --> 47:57.460
Right there, perfect.

47:57.460 --> 47:58.300
Thank you.

47:58.300 --> 47:59.120
Thank you.

47:59.120 --> 48:00.120
Please don't wave your hands like that.

48:00.120 --> 48:01.400
It's gonna give me a stroke.

48:01.400 --> 48:04.900
Uh, uh, how about, yeah, you right in front.

48:04.900 --> 48:06.020
Yeah, yeah.

48:06.020 --> 48:06.960
You should show your shoulders.

48:06.960 --> 48:08.660
Do you have a question or not?

48:08.660 --> 48:09.900
Okay, then make your way through.

48:09.900 --> 48:11.220
You got a long way to go.

48:11.220 --> 48:12.860
I'm so sorry, you are surrounded by.

48:12.860 --> 48:14.860
Anybody caught any good Pokemon in here?

48:18.160 --> 48:19.000
Only drowsy?

48:19.000 --> 48:19.820
Only fucking drowsy.

48:19.820 --> 48:20.660
I caught a pretty good drowsy.

48:20.660 --> 48:21.500
Hey, what's up?

48:21.500 --> 48:22.320
Hey, guys.

48:22.320 --> 48:23.160
What's your name?

48:23.160 --> 48:24.000
Connor.

48:24.000 --> 48:24.820
Hi, Connor.

48:24.820 --> 48:25.660
How are you?

48:25.660 --> 48:26.500
Good.

48:26.500 --> 48:27.320
Pretty good.

48:27.320 --> 48:28.160
Still?

48:28.160 --> 48:29.000
Pay attention, Connor.

48:29.000 --> 48:29.820
I just said how I was doing.

48:29.820 --> 48:30.660
All right.

48:30.660 --> 48:32.120
Two minutes ago.

48:32.120 --> 48:33.260
So, funny story.

48:33.260 --> 48:35.120
I just got married yesterday.

48:35.120 --> 48:36.300
Holy shit.

48:36.300 --> 48:38.000
Hilarious.

48:38.000 --> 48:39.460
Hey, hey, Connor.

48:39.460 --> 48:41.200
Are you on your funny moon?

48:41.200 --> 48:42.020
Ah.

48:44.160 --> 48:45.000
Good one.

48:47.200 --> 48:48.120
How dare you?

48:49.420 --> 48:51.200
So, my question for you guys is,

48:51.200 --> 48:53.620
all three of you are very happily married.

48:53.620 --> 48:54.460
Congratulations.

48:54.460 --> 48:55.300
Thank you.

48:55.300 --> 48:57.400
And I wanted to know, did you have, you know,

48:57.400 --> 48:59.200
any advice for newlyweds?

48:59.200 --> 49:01.200
Like, when you guys kind of made that transition

49:01.200 --> 49:05.500
from, you know, partners to actually married couple.

49:05.500 --> 49:07.260
Like, did anything change?

49:08.360 --> 49:09.200
No.

49:09.200 --> 49:10.520
Taxes get pretty cool.

49:10.520 --> 49:11.360
Shit.

49:15.360 --> 49:16.860
Here's the thing I'd say.

49:18.700 --> 49:22.160
This is the best advice I ever got about being married.

49:22.160 --> 49:27.060
Treat the whole marriage like it's a 60-40 relationship

49:27.060 --> 49:28.900
and both of you treat it that way.

49:28.900 --> 49:31.720
And you do 60 and let them do 40.

49:31.720 --> 49:34.920
Because if you treat it 60-40, both of you,

49:34.920 --> 49:37.120
you are always trying to take that next step.

49:37.120 --> 49:39.660
And you're always trying to get that one thing

49:39.660 --> 49:40.800
to help that person through,

49:40.800 --> 49:42.420
to let them relax a little bit.

49:42.420 --> 49:44.720
And if you take it 60-40, and both of you do,

49:44.720 --> 49:46.420
and really commit to it, you're gonna be married.

49:46.420 --> 49:47.760
That's 200% then.

49:47.760 --> 49:48.600
Oh, yeah.

49:50.300 --> 49:52.160
Listen, if Justin's gonna go to legitimate,

49:52.160 --> 49:53.360
I'm gonna go legitimate.

49:53.360 --> 49:55.400
Yeah.

49:55.400 --> 49:59.520
The answer is, for me, that the difference between

49:59.520 --> 50:00.360
marriage.

50:00.360 --> 50:01.200
You've been married longer.

50:01.200 --> 50:02.020
I've been married longer.

50:02.020 --> 50:02.860
It's not a big deal.

50:02.860 --> 50:03.700
I believe it.

50:03.700 --> 50:06.620
The difference between a marriage and dating

50:06.620 --> 50:09.260
or anything you've done before now to you now.

50:09.260 --> 50:11.060
I would say, I wouldn't say marriage.

50:11.060 --> 50:13.720
Because expanding that widely to like,

50:13.720 --> 50:14.560
long-term commitment.

50:14.560 --> 50:16.820
The difference between a long-term commitment

50:16.820 --> 50:19.320
is that you gotta play it long-term.

50:19.320 --> 50:22.120
And so right now, if there's something that comes up,

50:22.120 --> 50:23.920
you need to address it right away.

50:23.920 --> 50:25.620
Because what you're doing is you're building

50:25.620 --> 50:27.420
a building over time.

50:27.420 --> 50:29.360
And so you need to go brick by brick,

50:29.360 --> 50:31.720
build a strong foundation, and every moment

50:31.720 --> 50:33.860
is an opportunity to strengthen your relationship.

50:33.860 --> 50:36.120
Because if you're committed to making it last

50:36.120 --> 50:38.760
for a long time, you need to make it structurally sound.

50:38.760 --> 50:40.900
And that only comes from being open and honest

50:40.900 --> 50:42.920
with each other and saying how you feel in that moment.

50:42.920 --> 50:45.560
Because anything you hold back, any frustration

50:45.560 --> 50:46.400
you don't share.

50:46.400 --> 50:48.020
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you have Pokemon Go open

50:48.020 --> 50:50.160
on your fucking phone right now while you're doing this.

50:50.160 --> 50:55.160
I do.

50:56.560 --> 50:57.720
It's not a goof.

50:59.260 --> 51:01.260
I'm not gonna miss out on some Gastlys.

51:10.360 --> 51:12.300
Listen, if you need to catch another Drowzee.

51:12.300 --> 51:13.760
Wait, I'm done, sorry, there's a Pokemon in here.

51:13.760 --> 51:15.200
Yeah, if you need to catch another Drowzee,

51:15.200 --> 51:16.260
that's fine, go for it.

51:16.260 --> 51:18.220
I said that, Griffin, do you have anything to add?

51:18.220 --> 51:20.120
I said that is going to be funnier or better

51:20.120 --> 51:21.820
than the things that have already been said.

51:21.820 --> 51:22.660
Okay, thank you, Connor.

51:22.660 --> 51:23.500
Thank you, Connor.

51:23.500 --> 51:25.360
Congratulations, by the way, that's fantastic.

51:25.360 --> 51:26.200
Hey.

51:28.320 --> 51:29.160
Okay.

51:31.220 --> 51:32.460
I'm sorry, there's somebody that's been waving

51:32.460 --> 51:33.920
their arms so furiously back there.

51:33.920 --> 51:35.200
Yes, guy with two hands up.

51:35.200 --> 51:36.960
Yes, come on, guy with two hands.

51:36.960 --> 51:37.860
You've earned it.

51:39.000 --> 51:41.200
And he's jogging too, this is awesome.

51:41.200 --> 51:42.040
Hi.

51:42.040 --> 51:44.120
Hi, thank y'all, my name is John Paul from Nashville.

51:44.120 --> 51:45.080
John Paul!

51:45.080 --> 51:47.100
You were here last night, right?

51:47.100 --> 51:49.480
So, y'all have inspired me to start my own

51:49.480 --> 51:52.660
hobby business called HauntedComputers.com.

51:52.660 --> 51:53.500
Uh-huh.

51:53.500 --> 51:54.320
Oh, yes.

51:54.320 --> 51:56.320
And I have a, well, yes, sir.

51:56.320 --> 51:58.240
Okay, I'm sorry, I hate to stop you.

51:59.640 --> 52:00.760
Put your phone away.

52:00.760 --> 52:02.160
I'm done, I'm done, I'm done.

52:02.160 --> 52:03.960
You gotta stop catching Pokemon.

52:03.960 --> 52:04.800
I'm done, I'm done.

52:04.800 --> 52:05.620
I may need your, okay.

52:05.620 --> 52:06.560
Sorry, JP, go ahead.

52:06.560 --> 52:07.840
Is JP cool, is that?

52:07.840 --> 52:09.780
JP is great, softball coach.

52:09.780 --> 52:10.620
How about JP?

52:10.620 --> 52:11.460
Ah!

52:13.400 --> 52:14.240
Fucking rules.

52:14.240 --> 52:15.080
Glorious!

52:15.080 --> 52:15.900
What's up?

52:15.900 --> 52:16.740
Okay, keep going, I'm sorry.

52:16.740 --> 52:19.400
I have a lot of friends who've expressed interest

52:19.400 --> 52:21.280
in helping me with this project.

52:21.280 --> 52:26.280
How do I evaluate their haunted computer skills?

52:27.760 --> 52:30.480
How do I know who is gonna help me

52:30.480 --> 52:32.160
in evaluating haunted computers?

52:32.160 --> 52:33.920
Are they good at lying?

52:33.920 --> 52:36.920
Now, hold on.

52:38.820 --> 52:40.800
Wait, that's true, unless.

52:40.800 --> 52:41.640
Unless.

52:41.640 --> 52:42.480
Unless.

52:42.480 --> 52:43.960
Unless.

52:43.960 --> 52:47.320
Ghosts are real.

52:47.320 --> 52:51.200
What if computer, okay, computers can do a lot of things.

52:51.200 --> 52:52.220
Maybe ghosts?

52:54.040 --> 52:55.760
I think a computer could do a ghost.

52:55.760 --> 52:58.800
Yeah, what if you programmed a ghost?

52:58.800 --> 53:01.640
Can I ask what qualifies as a haunted computer?

53:01.640 --> 53:04.920
It's just one that has like all the porno viruses in it.

53:05.960 --> 53:10.840
My practice is that it's a Venn diagram.

53:10.840 --> 53:13.400
If you believe that you don't understand computers

53:13.400 --> 53:14.340
and you believe in ghosts,

53:14.340 --> 53:16.240
then you might have a haunted computer.

53:17.400 --> 53:20.400
Okay, so if you're 85 years old,

53:20.400 --> 53:21.720
every computer's haunted.

53:21.720 --> 53:23.360
So what you're saying is you're setting up

53:23.360 --> 53:25.840
a very predatory business,

53:25.840 --> 53:28.060
and you want to figure out which of your friends

53:28.060 --> 53:31.640
are qualified to do that.

53:32.960 --> 53:34.000
Yes.

53:36.000 --> 53:41.000
I assume that you guys might have a more intimate connection

53:41.000 --> 53:46.000
with what might make a great cyber paranormal specialist.

53:46.240 --> 53:47.840
Here's what you need to do.

53:47.840 --> 53:49.840
You need to, in your interview with them,

53:49.840 --> 53:50.960
at the very end,

53:50.960 --> 53:53.240
reveal that you will not be charging customers

53:53.240 --> 53:54.720
or paying them,

53:54.720 --> 53:58.000
and anyone who sticks around is in it for the goof,

53:59.020 --> 54:00.440
and you keep them.

54:00.440 --> 54:02.080
Okay, okay.

54:02.080 --> 54:04.520
Can I tell you something, though?

54:04.520 --> 54:07.400
I would, depending on the price,

54:07.400 --> 54:09.660
I would buy the fuck out of a haunted computer

54:09.660 --> 54:12.860
and try to crack the code of the spirit within.

54:14.300 --> 54:15.400
Me too, Griffin.

54:15.400 --> 54:17.060
I would, I mean, I'm literally talking about

54:17.060 --> 54:20.680
any computer that had Kazaa on it in 1998.

54:22.680 --> 54:24.400
And it's still downloading.

54:24.400 --> 54:25.880
Party of five.

54:25.880 --> 54:26.700
Woo!

54:29.140 --> 54:30.540
Did that help?

54:30.540 --> 54:31.380
Tremendously.

54:31.380 --> 54:32.200
Cool, cool.

54:32.200 --> 54:33.040
Thank you.

54:33.040 --> 54:33.880
Wait, wait, wait.

54:33.880 --> 54:34.700
I want to keep a balance.

54:34.700 --> 54:36.280
Can we get a woman,

54:36.280 --> 54:37.360
or transitional, or non-binary?

54:37.360 --> 54:38.200
Right there, Stripes.

54:38.200 --> 54:39.020
Anybody, yes.

54:39.020 --> 54:41.680
Stripes, Stripes, Stripes, Stripes, come on down.

54:41.680 --> 54:42.520
You can do it.

54:42.520 --> 54:44.400
It's a long road, but you got it.

54:44.400 --> 54:46.200
Okay, take what, actually?

54:46.200 --> 54:48.140
Stripes, start making your way over.

54:48.140 --> 54:49.240
You're next.

54:49.240 --> 54:50.080
And we'll get somebody from over here.

54:50.080 --> 54:51.320
Oh, you're in the queue.

54:51.320 --> 54:52.240
Right there with the glasses.

54:52.240 --> 54:53.060
Glasses.

54:53.060 --> 54:54.400
Yes, yes, yes.

54:54.400 --> 54:55.240
Come on down.

54:55.240 --> 54:56.060
And then Stripes.

54:56.060 --> 54:56.900
And then Stripes.

54:56.900 --> 54:58.880
Stripes, you got this next.

54:58.880 --> 54:59.720
Put your coat on.

54:59.720 --> 55:02.000
I like to reduce people to one description.

55:02.000 --> 55:02.840
Hello.

55:02.840 --> 55:03.660
Hi.

55:03.660 --> 55:04.500
Hi.

55:04.500 --> 55:05.760
My name is Hani.

55:05.760 --> 55:06.580
Hi, Hani.

55:06.580 --> 55:07.420
I'm here to say,

55:07.420 --> 55:09.480
I love Fruity Pebbles in a major way.

55:09.480 --> 55:14.480
Oh, ho, ho, I'm hungry, Santa, my Pebbles, your Pebbles,

55:17.440 --> 55:20.440
it's the season to be sharing, friend.

55:20.440 --> 55:22.320
Happy Holidays, pal.

55:22.320 --> 55:25.320
Is that what you meant when you said we're gonna get wild?

55:25.320 --> 55:26.320
That's so wild, it's weird.

55:26.320 --> 55:27.320
That was fucking weird.

55:27.320 --> 55:28.320
Thank you for answering my question.

55:28.320 --> 55:29.320
Hi, yeah, thank you.

55:29.320 --> 55:30.320
You're welcome.

55:30.320 --> 55:31.320
No, what's your question?

55:31.320 --> 55:32.320
Hey, my question is,

55:32.320 --> 55:33.320
how did that feel?

55:33.320 --> 55:34.320
How did that feel?

55:34.320 --> 55:35.320
How did that feel?

55:35.320 --> 55:36.320
How did that feel?

55:36.320 --> 55:39.320
My question is, how did that fucking Christmas

55:39.320 --> 55:41.320
Fruity Pebbles jingle go?

55:41.320 --> 55:42.320
Hi.

55:42.320 --> 55:43.320
Hi.

55:43.320 --> 55:44.320
Okay.

55:44.320 --> 55:47.320
Sorry, what was your name?

55:47.320 --> 55:48.320
Hani.

55:48.320 --> 55:49.320
Hani, Jesus.

55:49.320 --> 55:50.320
Sorry.

55:50.320 --> 55:51.320
What's up?

55:51.320 --> 55:54.320
So, I have an extremely cute dog that lives with my parents.

55:54.320 --> 55:56.320
He's our family dog.

55:56.320 --> 56:01.320
And whenever me and my sister go home to visit our parents,

56:01.320 --> 56:03.320
she hogs the dog.

56:03.320 --> 56:06.320
She does not let me cuddle with him.

56:06.320 --> 56:08.320
She calls him over whenever I'm playing with him.

56:08.320 --> 56:11.320
She locks her door at night whenever he's sleeping on her bed.

56:11.320 --> 56:14.320
So, what I want to know is, we are grown ass adults,

56:14.320 --> 56:16.320
how do we share the dog?

56:16.320 --> 56:17.320
Pocket full of bacon.

56:17.320 --> 56:19.320
Pocket full of bacon.

56:19.320 --> 56:31.320
And put in her pockets, mailman cologne.

56:31.320 --> 56:38.320
Dog catcher perfume.

56:38.320 --> 56:42.320
Do you have a kosher option?

56:42.320 --> 56:50.320
Wait, you have dogs that keep kosher?

56:50.320 --> 56:53.320
I don't know anything dogs like other than turds.

56:53.320 --> 56:56.320
And I don't think you should put dog turds in your pocket.

56:56.320 --> 56:59.320
That's me.

56:59.320 --> 57:01.320
Oh, man.

57:01.320 --> 57:04.320
I mean, turkey bacon is the obvious answer.

57:04.320 --> 57:09.320
It's just, is it funny?

57:09.320 --> 57:11.320
See, that's what we have to worry about up here,

57:11.320 --> 57:14.320
that you out there, you just shout whatever.

57:14.320 --> 57:17.320
Okay, you need to show up next time with an identical dog.

57:17.320 --> 57:19.320
And then swap them around and put them back down

57:19.320 --> 57:22.320
and tell her she can have one of them.

57:22.320 --> 57:26.320
That's kind of like the wisdom of Solomon, but double and not.

57:26.320 --> 57:28.320
So, you don't have to cut anything in half.

57:28.320 --> 57:29.320
That's my baby, that's my baby.

57:29.320 --> 57:31.320
Well, here's two babies.

57:31.320 --> 57:32.320
All right.

57:32.320 --> 57:33.320
Cool, cool.

57:33.320 --> 57:35.320
Yeah, Solomon, you're wise as fuck.

57:35.320 --> 57:39.320
That's way smarter, Solomon, than cutting a stupid baby in half.

57:39.320 --> 57:41.320
I'm going to cut both babies in half.

57:41.320 --> 57:43.320
Fuck it, get ten babies in here, I'm cutting them all up.

57:43.320 --> 57:44.320
No, Solomon.

57:44.320 --> 57:45.320
No, no, no.

57:45.320 --> 57:47.320
That is decidedly unwise.

57:47.320 --> 57:50.320
Not against, Solomon.

57:50.320 --> 57:52.320
We got babies coming out the ears here.

57:52.320 --> 57:54.320
You want a baby, I'll get you a baby.

57:54.320 --> 57:56.320
That's crazy Solomon's house of babies.

57:56.320 --> 57:59.320
I'll get you three and a half babies from seven different babies.

57:59.320 --> 58:00.320
Solomon, no.

58:00.320 --> 58:03.320
Bad credit, no credit, it doesn't matter.

58:03.320 --> 58:04.320
I'm going to get you a...

58:04.320 --> 58:07.320
We're sending a half a baby home with you.

58:07.320 --> 58:10.320
Listen, the price is going to grow up and the kids are going to grow up.

58:10.320 --> 58:13.320
So, you need to get into one of these babies, not in a baby.

58:13.320 --> 58:16.320
I mean get a baby in, like get a...

58:16.320 --> 58:20.320
Hey, um...

58:20.320 --> 58:21.320
Try my best.

58:21.320 --> 58:24.320
Do you have to pee?

58:24.320 --> 58:25.320
I do.

58:25.320 --> 58:26.320
Great.

58:26.320 --> 58:27.320
Do you...

58:27.320 --> 58:28.320
Who loves the dog more?

58:28.320 --> 58:31.320
That's the real question and I don't want to put you on the spot.

58:31.320 --> 58:32.320
Who loves the dog more?

58:32.320 --> 58:33.320
Yeah.

58:33.320 --> 58:34.320
I do.

58:34.320 --> 58:35.320
Okay.

58:35.320 --> 58:38.320
If they were here, would they say the same thing though?

58:38.320 --> 58:39.320
She's not here, so...

58:39.320 --> 58:40.320
Oh, that's a good point.

58:40.320 --> 58:41.320
So, you know what?

58:41.320 --> 58:42.320
Fuck her.

58:42.320 --> 58:43.320
You know what?

58:43.320 --> 58:47.320
Seriously, if you really care about this dog, the important thing is that that dog is being

58:47.320 --> 58:48.320
cared and loved for.

58:48.320 --> 58:49.320
That is wrong.

58:49.320 --> 58:53.320
As a dog owner, the important thing is you get the face licks.

58:53.320 --> 58:58.320
I'm expecting a dynamic rescue where she closes the door, you kick that shit in, you take

58:58.320 --> 59:03.320
that dog out, and then, I don't know, a smoke bomb or something, you and the dog are never

59:03.320 --> 59:04.320
seen again.

59:04.320 --> 59:05.320
You go live in a Wahaneho.

59:05.320 --> 59:06.320
A what?

59:06.320 --> 59:09.320
Is that where they go in Shawshank Redemption?

59:09.320 --> 59:12.320
Does that answer the question?

59:12.320 --> 59:13.320
Perfecto.

59:13.320 --> 59:14.320
Great.

59:14.320 --> 59:15.320
Glad we could help Stripes.

59:15.320 --> 59:16.320
Stripes, Stripes, Stripes, Stripes.

59:16.320 --> 59:17.320
Hi.

59:17.320 --> 59:18.320
Hi.

59:18.320 --> 59:19.320
What's your name?

59:19.320 --> 59:20.320
Hi, I'm Tiffany.

59:20.320 --> 59:25.320
What if you had been like, it is actually Stripes.

59:25.320 --> 59:26.320
Stripes.

59:26.320 --> 59:27.320
Stripes.

59:27.320 --> 59:28.320
No, that's totally fine.

59:28.320 --> 59:29.320
Named that for my grandmother.

59:29.320 --> 59:30.320
Perfect.

59:30.320 --> 59:32.320
I feel the heritage.

59:32.320 --> 59:36.320
So, I was wondering, so two-thirds of you move a lot.

59:36.320 --> 59:37.320
Yes.

59:37.320 --> 59:40.320
And I was wondering, how are you guys like cool when you move?

59:40.320 --> 59:43.320
I've moved eight times in the last eight years.

59:43.320 --> 59:44.320
True.

59:44.320 --> 59:45.320
How do you make friends?

59:45.320 --> 59:46.320
Oh, man.

59:46.320 --> 59:47.320
I left.

59:47.320 --> 59:50.320
You have friends like Griffin.

59:50.320 --> 59:52.320
You have a friend named Pop Tart, right?

59:52.320 --> 59:53.320
That's a horse.

59:53.320 --> 59:58.320
I met a mini-donk once that was named Pop Tart.

59:58.320 --> 59:59.320
Dope, for sure.

59:59.320 --> 01:00:00.320
I will say this.

01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:01.320
It was fucking legendary.

01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:03.320
It was a legend.

01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:10.160
I didn't make friends the first time I moved to beautiful Batavia, Ohio because Travis

01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:12.800
and I were the only living human beings there.

01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:13.800
Sure.

01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:18.960
Everybody else there was like an animatronic mannequin and it turns out it was a real house

01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:19.960
of wax situation.

01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:20.960
Wow.

01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:21.960
Okay.

01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:22.960
Luckily, we got out of there with our skin still.

01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:23.960
Some of us did.

01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:26.000
So, I think it turned out okay.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.880
And then in Chicago, basically same situation.

01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:32.920
And then when I moved to Austin, I just had friends there already and built my friend

01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:33.920
group out.

01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:38.080
Having a foundation friend is really important because you can spiral out from that.

01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:41.600
As long as they're like real salt of the earth, cool people.

01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:43.000
What happens if I move from...

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:47.000
I'm from Phoenix and I moved to Portland, Maine.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:48.800
There you go.

01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:49.800
You need to take a listen from...

01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:50.800
Wait, wait, wait.

01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:51.800
Seriously.

01:00:51.800 --> 01:00:52.800
Any Portland, Maine people out here?

01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:53.800
Raise your hand.

01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:54.800
Up there.

01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:55.800
There you go.

01:00:55.800 --> 01:00:56.800
Okay.

01:00:56.800 --> 01:00:57.800
There's like 30 people like...

01:00:57.800 --> 01:00:58.800
Okay.

01:00:58.800 --> 01:00:59.800
Okay.

01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:04.080
Tonight, tweet with the bim bam Portland, Maine hashtag and we're going to get everybody

01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:05.080
connected.

01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:06.080
It's going to be good.

01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:07.080
That's a good...

01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:08.080
That's legit.

01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:09.080
Hey, listen.

01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:17.080
It is really... it's genuinely very, very hard and it seems like hopeless when you don't

01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:18.080
have any friends.

01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:21.440
Literally, all it takes is that first step, that first friend, that first place of like

01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:26.120
putting yourself out there and like meeting a person who's also like in our day and age,

01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:29.880
like everybody's moving around all the time and doesn't have like a lot of friends and

01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:30.880
so everybody's kind...

01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:33.240
There are lots of people in your position that are also looking for people like you

01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:35.160
to be friends with and start a friend group.

01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:36.160
I got one.

01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:37.160
I brought her.

01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:38.160
Okay.

01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:39.160
So...

01:01:39.160 --> 01:01:40.160
Hi.

01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:41.160
Yeah.

01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:42.160
What's her name?

01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:43.160
Yeah.

01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:44.160
Her name's Swathi.

01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:45.160
Hey, Swathi.

01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:46.160
What's up?

01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:47.160
You should also take a lesson...

01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:48.160
Hi.

01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:53.640
You should also take a lesson from five-year-olds, which is if you ever see five-year-olds make

01:01:53.640 --> 01:01:55.160
friends, they make friends like this.

01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:56.720
I want to be your friend now.

01:01:56.720 --> 01:01:57.720
Yeah.

01:01:57.720 --> 01:01:58.720
Yeah.

01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:01.400
Because I think as you get older as an adult, you get very self-conscious telling people

01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:05.800
you want to be their friends, but if you have a good conversation with someone at a thing,

01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:06.800
tell them you want to be friends.

01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:08.560
I wish the hell somebody would say that to me.

01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:09.560
You know, I don't move.

01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:10.560
I only got one friend.

01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:11.560
It's my dear friend Dwight Slab.

01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:14.560
He co-hosts the things I bought at Sheetz.

01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:16.600
That's it.

01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:21.440
I have other friends, but he's the only one I do a hit web series with, so...

01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:24.120
It's cool, though, because it's a pretty dope web series.

01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:25.360
It's a good web series.

01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:26.960
I'll also say one last thing.

01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:31.880
Download the application Pokemon Go on your cell phone, because I was at Starbucks the

01:02:31.880 --> 01:02:36.160
other day and I was just having my breakfast sandwich and I was just catching my Nidorans

01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:40.200
and this dude walked up and he was just like, hey, you doing any good gym battles lately?

01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:44.000
And I was like, yeah, and then I nervously looked back down at my computer.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:47.480
So as long as you don't get a Griffin, you're going to be fine.

01:02:47.480 --> 01:02:48.480
You're going to be great.

01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:52.720
That's actually how we're friends.

01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:55.160
You are the best Pokemon Goer that there is.

01:02:55.160 --> 01:02:56.160
She's putting you on blast.

01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:57.160
What's up, Stripes?

01:02:57.160 --> 01:02:58.160
What do you got?

01:02:58.160 --> 01:02:59.160
Does that help at all?

01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:00.160
Yeah.

01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:01.160
No, that totally...

01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:02.160
Hell yeah.

01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:03.160
Let's do one more.

01:03:03.160 --> 01:03:04.160
One more?

01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:09.920
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:13.120
We have somebody pointing to somebody else who's pointing at themselves, yeah, in the

01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:14.120
back right corner there.

01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:15.120
Yeah, you.

01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:16.120
Yeah, you.

01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:17.120
You jumping up and down.

01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:18.120
Yes.

01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:19.120
Yeah, you won.

01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:20.120
Come on down.

01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:21.120
Somebody's just screaming like, no, no.

01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:22.120
I'm sorry.

01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:23.120
Hi.

01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:24.120
Hello.

01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:25.120
Hi.

01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:26.120
What's your name?

01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:28.560
Britney, but I'm also known as Slick Tracy.

01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:38.000
I play for Boston Roller Derby and we just won our game, so yeah.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:39.000
Yeah.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:43.800
Who'd you beat, who'd you beat?

01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:45.800
We beat the Harbor Horrors.

01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:46.800
Okay.

01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:47.800
Okay.

01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:50.800
There's actually no way for us to respond to that.

01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:53.800
We're the Wicked Pissas.

01:03:53.800 --> 01:03:54.800
Yeah.

01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:55.800
Very good.

01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:56.800
What is your question?

01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:58.800
It's not how do I roller derby good, because that's not...

01:03:58.800 --> 01:03:59.800
It's not.

01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:00.800
No, it's not.

01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:01.800
Okay, good.

01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:02.800
I'm actually curious since you're all married.

01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:03.800
I got engaged a few months ago.

01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:04.800
Congratulations.

01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:05.800
Thank you.

01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:06.800
Big fans.

01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:11.240
I'm just curious if you have any advice for wedding planning, because it's a daunting

01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:12.240
task.

01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:13.240
Don't do it.

01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:14.240
Don't do it.

01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:15.240
Yeah, don't do it.

01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:16.520
Just fucking show up.

01:04:16.520 --> 01:04:19.520
That's 90% of wedding planning is just showing up.

01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:22.120
Make it like a puzzle room, an escape room.

01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:24.760
Have someone else plan it and you got to figure out what's going on.

01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:33.160
Or make the wedding like an escape puzzle room.

01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:40.200
Everybody shut up and let me figure out how that would work.

01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:44.320
You would need 100 rooms.

01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:45.320
That sounds expensive.

01:04:45.320 --> 01:04:46.320
Yeah.

01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:47.320
Let us finish.

01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:48.320
It will be expensive.

01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:55.080
You will also need to employ 100 discrete puzzle masters.

01:04:55.080 --> 01:05:01.960
And I mean discrete in both senses of the word discrete.

01:05:01.960 --> 01:05:08.280
If you and your betrothed are not the first two people to escape-

01:05:08.280 --> 01:05:09.280
It was not meant to be.

01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:18.640
Then the first two people to escape have to get married, high stakes.

01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:19.640
High stakes.

01:05:19.640 --> 01:05:22.000
You got to make it the first couple has to get married, second couple has to get a little

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:23.000
married.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.760
The first couple has to get barely married.

01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:26.760
That's it.

01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:27.760
Fuck.

01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:28.760
I had it in my grasp.

01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:30.480
Let me ask you a question.

01:05:30.480 --> 01:05:33.680
Think in your sphere of people you know and love and trust.

01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:37.760
Is there one person that presumably it's not any of them.

01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:38.760
They're here.

01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:39.760
Okay, cool.

01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:40.760
Hey.

01:05:40.760 --> 01:05:42.640
Think of the whole sphere of people you know and love and trust.

01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:49.000
Is there one amongst them who would like really, really get into planning a wedding?

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:50.000
Me.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:51.000
Yeah.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:52.000
Okay.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:53.000
But like we were trying to offload.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:54.000
Oh.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:55.000
My mom but she lives in Seattle.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:56.000
Period.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:57.000
I don't want to hear any more.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:58.000
Chosen person.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:05:59.000
Chosen person.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:02.880
It just became your mom's problem and then do what I do, show up to your wedding and

01:06:02.880 --> 01:06:05.080
be like this is beautiful.

01:06:05.080 --> 01:06:07.480
Everybody did a great job.

01:06:07.480 --> 01:06:08.480
I didn't help.

01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:09.480
No.

01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:10.480
You did a bad job.

01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:14.880
You also want to make sure like balance however you want to do that.

01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:17.800
If you feel like you want to take control of it a little bit more, make sure you tell

01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:20.640
your betrothed that so that they know where they stand.

01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:22.640
Why do we keep saying the betrothed over and over again?

01:06:22.640 --> 01:06:23.640
You said it first.

01:06:23.640 --> 01:06:24.640
Hey, listen.

01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:25.640
I will tell you one practical tip.

01:06:25.640 --> 01:06:29.240
If you're going to hire a DJ, make sure you pick the playlist before you get it.

01:06:29.240 --> 01:06:30.240
Oh, my God.

01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:31.240
100%.

01:06:31.240 --> 01:06:32.240
Fuck yes.

01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:33.240
I know.

01:06:33.240 --> 01:06:34.240
Let them go hog on it.

01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:38.440
I had the wedding DJ at my wedding attempt to close the wedding.

01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:43.880
With first Frank Sinatra's Love and Marriage.

01:06:43.880 --> 01:06:48.200
You know, the theme song to Married with Children.

01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:54.360
And then he tried to, I shit you not, tried to wrap the whole shindig up with Garth Brooks'

01:06:54.360 --> 01:06:55.360
The Dance.

01:06:55.360 --> 01:06:56.360
Holy shit.

01:06:56.360 --> 01:06:57.360
I just put a nice bow on it.

01:06:57.360 --> 01:06:58.360
Did you apologize to Sydney?

01:06:58.360 --> 01:07:03.760
Yeah, but it was just the two of us there at that point, so it was fine.

01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:05.960
Because everyone left at Love and Marriage.

01:07:05.960 --> 01:07:06.960
Right.

01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:11.880
I went to a wedding once where somebody played an Elvis Presley medley.

01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:14.360
No, dawg.

01:07:14.360 --> 01:07:16.040
Nobody wants this.

01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:20.480
If you're playing a medley of any sort, here's something y'all are going to dance to, nine

01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:22.720
different songs in three minutes.

01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:25.240
No, wrong.

01:07:25.240 --> 01:07:26.640
Incorrect.

01:07:26.640 --> 01:07:27.800
False.

01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:30.560
Uh, yeah.

01:07:30.560 --> 01:07:36.920
But if they will do, play Soul Man and do a Blues Brothers thing, that's always a big

01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:37.920
deal.

01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:41.640
I used to have to do that at the Pub Family Fun Center.

01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:42.640
It was great.

01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:43.640
It was good.

01:07:43.640 --> 01:07:44.640
How did we do?

01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:45.640
How did we do?

01:07:45.640 --> 01:07:46.640
Great.

01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:47.640
You're invited.

01:07:47.640 --> 01:07:48.640
Yay!

01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:57.000
I think that's going to do it for us.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:58.920
Thank you all so much, Boston.

01:07:58.920 --> 01:07:59.920
You've been so good.

01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:00.920
It's been so cool.

01:08:00.920 --> 01:08:03.560
Can we kill the house lights?

01:08:03.560 --> 01:08:07.320
I don't want to look at them while I thank them for their kindness.

01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:10.160
Dismiss them.

01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:14.680
So like we mentioned, there's going to be posters after the show, but it's very limited

01:08:14.680 --> 01:08:15.680
so we don't even know if there's any left.

01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:16.680
Maybe.

01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:17.680
I don't know if they sold out of them.

01:08:17.680 --> 01:08:18.680
Yeah.

01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:19.680
We fucked up the poster situation last night.

01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:20.680
Did not print enough.

01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:21.680
Who was here last night for Adventure Zone?

01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:23.840
Okay, so fucking everybody then.

01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:25.240
We would ask just to throw it out there.

01:08:25.240 --> 01:08:28.560
If you bought a poster last night, leave some for the rest of the people.

01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:30.960
Unless as you're leaving, there are some.

01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:31.960
We don't want to take it.

01:08:31.960 --> 01:08:32.960
Okay.

01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:34.960
I have a flow chart.

01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:40.280
We sold, we signed all the posters backstage before we put them out there and we were talking

01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:45.440
backstage and cannot imagine a sadder situation than us walking back to our hotel carrying

01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:49.520
a bunch of signed posters that nobody bought.

01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:50.520
So please buy them.

01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:51.520
Please buy them.

01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:53.720
Don't make us face that reality.

01:08:53.720 --> 01:09:01.760
On a sincere note, we will not be doing a live show for a while and I have to say sincerely,

01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:07.680
the two crowds at the Wilbur Theater here in Boston have been the loudest and best ever.

01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:10.680
Seriously, the fucking best.

01:09:10.680 --> 01:09:17.160
I promise, I'll say this right now, hand to God, we will come back to Boston in this exact

01:09:17.160 --> 01:09:19.200
theater because this has been the best ever.

01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:27.880
That's what I will also say, it's just the people here at the Wilbur have also been just

01:09:27.880 --> 01:09:28.880
amazing to work with.

01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:29.880
Amazing.

01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:30.880
Thank you so much to Kelsey.

01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:35.440
She's our tour manager for these two shows and has been so amazingly helpful.

01:09:35.440 --> 01:09:36.440
So thank you, Kelsey.

01:09:36.440 --> 01:09:37.440
You're the best.

01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:39.440
Thank you to Rachel, my wife, and Teresa.

01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:42.640
Oh, and my own wife, thank you very much.

01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:43.640
Thank you, Teresa.

01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:44.640
Thank you to Sawbones.

01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:45.640
Thank you to Sawbones.

01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:46.640
This is featuring Sidney McElroy.

01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:50.880
Thank you to Riley and Clint for the intros for the evening.

01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:54.200
Thank you to Riley, Smurl, and Clint McElroy, another big hand for them.

01:09:54.200 --> 01:09:55.200
Thank you to Billions.

01:09:55.200 --> 01:09:56.560
Billions booked these two shows for us.

01:09:56.560 --> 01:09:57.800
We would not be here without them.

01:09:57.800 --> 01:09:59.800
Thank you to Sean Roderick and the Long Winter Shoes for their song.

01:09:59.800 --> 01:10:04.120
Thanks to all the singers that's been part of it today.

01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:05.120
And mostly, thank you.

01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:06.120
Yeah, thank you all.

01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:07.120
Thank you, mostly, at all.

01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:09.700
