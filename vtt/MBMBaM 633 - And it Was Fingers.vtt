00:00.000 --> 00:04.820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

00:05.760 --> 00:10.580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

00:11.480 --> 00:17.660

There's a pretty well-known guy and he kills babysitters bad guy. You want to change it Mike? No

02:39.680 --> 02:44.880
I'll go by Mike Myers. Well, Mike Myers has ever worn a William Shatner mask to Halloween. Just be like

02:44.880 --> 02:46.960
Just a feel oh I said great

02:48.480 --> 02:50.920
So what what are we doing?

02:52.600 --> 02:57.480
Special it's a Travis's idea Travis. I don't want to steal your thunder. Go ahead and lay it out for us

02:57.600 --> 03:02.660
Well, well, the idea is basically I'm while you're listening to this in the UK

03:04.160 --> 03:09.600
Yeah, I know it's for I'm from the past and the future all at once time is a flat circle and you know

03:09.600 --> 03:12.000
What I said coming up. It's the spooky times

03:12.000 --> 03:15.800
It's just it's you know clock and so it's like let's do a Halloween special

03:15.800 --> 03:21.200
So we had people send in some spooky Halloween questions, and I assume you guys prepared a lot of spooky Halloween bids

03:21.880 --> 03:23.880
Yeah, a lot of great stuff

03:26.400 --> 03:27.880
Oh no

03:27.880 --> 03:35.360
Yeah, I have I have a mummy game. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I made up a mummy game

03:35.360 --> 03:42.160
Oh, there's a whole cornucopia of delights that I didn't even know awaited me

03:42.440 --> 03:46.840
Yeah, there's a lot of prep so hard with all my bits. In fact, you know what? I'm

03:48.120 --> 03:54.080
Deleting them. Okay. I deleted permanently all the great crap that I did because Griffin's got this mummy game

03:54.720 --> 03:57.400
Yeah, that'll probably take up 45 minutes at least

03:57.880 --> 04:03.060
Yeah, I'm gonna erase the question list. Let me erase the question list so we

04:03.060 --> 04:10.540
Know oh no, and this and then I'm tweeting the or changing the name of the show to mummy boy mummy's boys

04:10.780 --> 04:14.900
Yeah, mummy's boys and cuz it's just gonna starring Griffin

04:15.540 --> 04:21.420
McElroy. All right, Griff. I'm ready. I trademarked it. I changed the show name permanently and legally. Perfect. Let's go

04:23.100 --> 04:28.200
Okay, so this is the first round okay of the mummy game, okay

04:28.200 --> 04:33.620
It's called I'm sorry. Is it called the mummy game or yeah, okay

04:34.280 --> 04:40.400
It's called the mummy. It's called the mummy's game. Okay. Sorry. Okay the mummy. It's called the mummy's maze and

04:41.080 --> 04:45.040
Here's the first round. The first round is called the first round is called

04:45.600 --> 04:47.600
under wraps Oh

04:49.400 --> 04:54.200
Yeah, and this one I have a secret and you guys gotta have to guess it are you a mummy

04:54.200 --> 05:00.440
No, you guys you guys gotta have to guess my secret. That's under wraps the first round of the mummies. Can I try?

05:00.800 --> 05:02.000
Yeah, go

05:02.000 --> 05:05.520
You didn't prepare anything. No, that's not it. Next. Yes

05:06.880 --> 05:12.360
You're trying to bring back your long-lost bride on knocks on a moon. No, that's not it next

05:13.040 --> 05:15.040
So do you give us a hint?

05:15.960 --> 05:22.400
You're all scarabs. That's right. Justin got it. I'm all scarabs. I'm all scarabs inside

05:22.400 --> 05:23.280
uh

05:23.280 --> 05:25.280
Sure feels like it some days

05:25.640 --> 05:27.320
because

05:27.320 --> 05:29.920
That's the first round of the mummy's maze. It's called under wraps

05:29.920 --> 05:34.280
The second round of the mummy's maze is called the pyramid of shame

05:34.280 --> 05:39.720
Oh now a lot a lot of lesser people. Yeah said I want to space this out

05:39.920 --> 05:42.600
Let's do some more the regular episode and I'll come back for round

05:42.600 --> 05:45.560
No, I just want to get I just want to be done with the mummy's maze

05:45.560 --> 05:48.480
I came up with it, but I also fucking hate it. Oh

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
So it's like one of my beds

05:51.000 --> 05:55.640
Yeah, like I came up with it last night in a sort of dream

05:56.120 --> 06:02.480
Sweat like the be Ronak gets in made him up, but then it tortured him. Yeah, he was like, this is so good

06:02.480 --> 06:05.120
Fuck he's like, I don't want to make this to make it

06:05.120 --> 06:08.320
I don't want to do the mummy's maze, but fuck like it has to get out

06:08.320 --> 06:11.880
Yeah, I have to get it out of me. So this pyramid of shame

06:12.400 --> 06:15.040
Yeah in this one. We're gonna

06:16.200 --> 06:19.800
In this one, we're all gonna tell people what we're super ashamed about

06:19.800 --> 06:25.080
Oh, wait, we have to yeah and the big and the idea is it's a pyramid, right?

06:25.080 --> 06:32.720
So you want to start big? Okay, you go for a shame a big shame a huge shame a big shame

06:33.640 --> 06:40.240
Mmm, gosh, go ahead Griffin. Yeah. Yeah, if Griff's gonna go first. Yeah, sure. Okay, I

06:41.960 --> 06:44.980
Just I add a party

06:44.980 --> 06:52.740
Um whenever there's a party I usually don't get I don't get invited to those very much. Oh

06:54.220 --> 06:58.440
And that's a shame that's something you're ashamed of yeah other people go

06:59.500 --> 07:05.220
To them and get invited to them other dads. Yeah, I guess I should say now that my boys in school

07:05.780 --> 07:12.500
Other dads like really have you guys noticed brief sidebar? All the other dads know each other

07:12.500 --> 07:15.780
Okay, we can agree on this all the other dads know each other, correct?

07:15.780 --> 07:23.180
Yeah, they walk in and the party don't start till that dad's there then that dad every dad knows every other dad

07:23.180 --> 07:29.700
every other dad and this dad and they and they're over there over there and they're over there talking about like

07:30.500 --> 07:34.140
How to repair their like sports projectors

07:35.860 --> 07:41.140
Unless it's a car or not. I know how to repair things unless it's a relationship. Anyway, that's my shame

07:41.140 --> 07:47.100
But I laid the first brick of shame. Okay, my shame is that I've been mine was real and raw

07:47.980 --> 07:52.860
Mine was real and rock. Go ahead. Just to remind you. I've been telling the other dads not to invite Griffin to parties

07:54.020 --> 08:02.020
Justin do you know about it? Um, you know, it doesn't work if you're not I think my younger in my younger days I

08:03.100 --> 08:08.740
was not as thoughtful of a person as I like to think I am now and I feel like

08:08.740 --> 08:14.620
That if I've been more dialed into that, you know, like thinking about other people rather than just myself

08:14.620 --> 08:21.420
I would have had sort of more friends and connections. That's great. Maybe more dads would maybe more dad

08:21.420 --> 08:24.860
Maybe maybe this is an issue. We all still suffer from and that's why dad's hey

08:25.620 --> 08:31.060
Dad's hate this one. You can see the possibility for me. Is that these same dads?

08:32.020 --> 08:37.380
Were already popular. Oh, yeah sure now they're just like still

08:37.380 --> 08:38.740
still

08:38.740 --> 08:43.060
Popular right ads, but they're dads now and I'm still not in there

08:43.060 --> 08:48.140
Oh, here's my shame, even though I'm really excited whenever a new mission impossible movie comes out

08:48.140 --> 08:55.000
I don't really have a lot of passion regarding Top Gun Maverick and I don't know why it just doesn't do anything for me

08:55.000 --> 08:57.820
But like the idea of like oh another mission impossible fuck

08:57.820 --> 09:03.340
Yeah, but then they're like and they made another top gun. I'm like that doesn't doesn't click for me for some reason

09:03.340 --> 09:07.460
I see people on planes watching it and it seems like they're having a really good time

09:07.620 --> 09:13.820
They enjoy it, but I I just can't seem to get interested in watching Top Gun Maverick for this next round

09:13.820 --> 09:17.320
We're not even rented it. I paid a rent on my iPad and I'm on

09:18.380 --> 09:23.200
Bathroom paper go get bathroom paper for then. These first two rounds are hard because

09:24.260 --> 09:29.940
The first two rounds are hard because you have to really dig deep and say a bunch of stuff about yourself that maybe you don't

09:29.940 --> 09:35.220
Want to say in front of our audience, but that's just loosens you up for the third round, which is a fun one

09:35.220 --> 09:42.020
Okay, and this round is called under wraps and but it's not but this round is called under wraps and for this

09:42.020 --> 09:46.100
You'll need bathroom now Griffin, but the first round was called under wraps for this round

09:46.100 --> 09:52.580
You'll need to do bathroom paper Justin's returned Justin has some we are actually rationing it in my home

09:53.220 --> 09:56.540
So I can I use wrapping like can I use toilet paper with the guys?

09:56.540 --> 10:01.900
I mean you don't get to play this round. I just it's just Justin gets to play it

10:01.900 --> 10:07.300
Okay, and Justin you have ten seconds to turn it itself into a mummy ready set go one

10:08.060 --> 10:14.020
the neck for three four five six seven eight nine

10:15.100 --> 10:20.780
Ten oh stop. Don't wrap any more stop put the tissue down put the bathroom paper down

10:21.420 --> 10:22.500
Okay

10:22.500 --> 10:26.620
That's not a very good job. No put it back on the roll though cuz somebody's gonna use that

10:26.940 --> 10:32.380
Now sit there like that for the rest of the podcast Wow wait question though. Yeah, do it. So

10:33.180 --> 10:34.580
Well, he didn't get to do it

10:34.580 --> 10:39.540
He didn't get to do it cuz he wanted to fake it and he's been faking it this whole fucking time

10:39.540 --> 10:43.020
But you my road dog you've been over there the real

10:43.620 --> 10:46.980
Realist the realest mummy is what you are

10:46.980 --> 10:52.540
Now hold on can we jump back cuz I don't think it's fair that you get to judge my level of shame about not watching

10:52.780 --> 10:56.980
Top Gun Maverick because for all you know that might be the biggest shame in my life

10:56.980 --> 10:58.980
I don't have a lot to be embarrassed by

10:59.340 --> 11:01.900
Everything I've done is perfect. Yeah, hey, bud

11:06.740 --> 11:13.220
Man I'm gonna let me take a long hard look Justin wins the mummy's maze your next year when we play it

11:13.220 --> 11:15.980
maybe Travis will get his head out of his ass and

11:15.980 --> 11:22.220
And actually engage with the sport of it that I worked all night long to prepare

11:23.300 --> 11:27.940
That's actually my greatest shame is that I didn't go for it. I'm sorry. All right. Well save that for next year

11:27.940 --> 11:32.160
I'll say one this time this feels more like you know what this feels less like a Halloween episode

11:32.580 --> 11:38.580
And more like a Halloween party at school. Yes, kind of like and I thought about it. Like why can't we have

11:39.220 --> 11:42.580
Why can't podcasts have like hard a party? Yeah

11:42.580 --> 11:48.980
Thank you, this is like our office. This is our office party. This is our like our office party

11:48.980 --> 11:53.280
I don't know why podcasts can't have party episodes where it's just like yeah, they weren't really

11:54.420 --> 12:00.680
You know trying to make it good. Yeah, like they were just but they seemed like but they were hanging they were having real

12:00.680 --> 12:02.980
Yeah, they brought in a lot of individually

12:03.580 --> 12:09.060
Pre-packaged foods so that it was nice and safe and everybody could enjoy a juice boxes and what-have-you. Yeah

12:09.060 --> 12:15.420
Um, let's uh, let's ask one of your very scary questions here. Okay. I need some advice regarding tax on

12:17.100 --> 12:18.940
This is cruel

12:18.940 --> 12:24.100
Folks, you do it. This is cruel when you write them, you know who reads them. Okay, this is cruel. I

12:25.660 --> 12:27.660
Need some advice regarding

12:28.500 --> 12:29.700
taxonomical

12:29.700 --> 12:36.980
Accuracy nailed it does the term werewolf describe only the monstrous wolf creature of supernatural lore

12:36.980 --> 12:44.100
Or does it describe both the monster and the seemingly innocuous person who becomes that monster is a werewolf?

12:44.980 --> 12:48.100
Who is in her human form still a werewolf?

12:48.860 --> 12:50.860
That's for lady lycanthrope

12:51.180 --> 12:53.180
Labeler in London, Ontario

12:54.180 --> 12:56.180
Well, am I a ghost?

12:56.660 --> 12:58.340
No, no

12:58.340 --> 13:02.180
Okay, but one day I'll be a ghost so like

13:02.180 --> 13:08.740
By that logic you hope by that logic I'm I'm a ghost already. I'm already a ghost walking around a cliff

13:08.740 --> 13:11.620
And I'm sorry, but I have to quibble. All right, because

13:13.660 --> 13:14.960
I have to quibble

13:14.960 --> 13:21.060
Once you become a ghost you can't go back to being a human unless you have the machine from Casper the friendly ghost

13:21.060 --> 13:27.580
I'm Chris. Correct. Your your thing is actually very dumb Griffin because if you now I didn't say that

13:27.900 --> 13:32.020
Well, let me go ahead and Justin can say shit like that because he won the mummy's maze

13:32.020 --> 13:37.420
and that means that like he's in charge and he can say whatever he wants if someone's like hand me a piece of paper and

13:37.420 --> 13:40.980
You get the trunk of a tree and you bring it to them and you say here you are

13:40.980 --> 13:44.860
And then I'll say that's not paper and then you say well it will be

13:45.820 --> 13:53.140
That's yeah, that's nothing. That's nothing. Yeah, I do think it's okay. Here's the here's the thing. I do think

13:53.620 --> 13:55.840
They are well once they have been

13:55.840 --> 14:02.200
Infected in some way once they're cursed once they're whatever what have you to become a werewolf, right?

14:02.200 --> 14:05.200
and they change either at will or

14:05.880 --> 14:10.200
under the force of the full moon whether they are human form or

14:10.720 --> 14:13.920
Beast form they are now a werewolf

14:14.480 --> 14:18.400
That said I think it's unfair and probably a little gauche

14:18.640 --> 14:24.720
Probably like ruin a party if you see them in a human form like and you're a werewolf and like hey, hey, come on

14:24.720 --> 14:29.280
Hey, that's not okay, but here's the thing that fucks me up all the time

14:30.600 --> 14:35.720
Where werewolves here's the thing werewolf isn't real vampire vampire isn't real

14:36.400 --> 14:43.440
Frankenstein zombie isn't real skeletons walking around dancing. Skeletons are real bones. Yeah. Okay skeletons are real

14:44.400 --> 14:45.600
but

14:45.600 --> 14:47.520
mummies

14:47.520 --> 14:52.780
Mummies are real mummies are real in that wild that is wild

14:52.780 --> 14:56.180
But skeletons are also real in that way Griffin

14:59.980 --> 15:02.860
Not real enough to Griffin not walking around though

15:05.100 --> 15:11.340
But they did it was some point guys I just drank I had an old coffee here from like zombie coffee

15:13.900 --> 15:16.900
Like just just ripped it nice, dude

15:16.900 --> 15:22.560
Anyway, um, I don't think I think aware. I don't I think if you say oh

15:23.360 --> 15:28.480
Werewolf and you point to just a person that's not that you are not being

15:29.440 --> 15:35.720
Helpful, you may be being accurate with your language, but you're not being helpful. There is which there it is. Yeah, I think that's true

15:35.720 --> 15:40.200
Yes, that's true. Good. That's it feels good to settle one, you know, yeah, sure

15:40.200 --> 15:45.680
Um, hey, you know, who else is real the wizard and he wants us to learn

15:46.760 --> 15:50.600
By way of Zack who sent it in how to live in a haunted house

15:52.440 --> 15:57.080
This is a you just moved in and now you have had really bad feelings about the place

15:57.280 --> 16:03.080
Chances are the place could be haunted you may be frightened, but don't be reading this. I really not buyers or more

16:03.280 --> 16:09.200
Don't worry about that and this economy is a ghost reading this article can help you cope with the ghost presence

16:09.200 --> 16:13.360
It would be cool if you may be frightened, but don't be was a phrase

16:14.080 --> 16:16.000
with any amount of

16:16.000 --> 16:17.520
efficacy

16:17.520 --> 16:21.040
Like whatsoever. Yeah. Yeah as a parent if I could

16:21.480 --> 16:29.080
Pull out that card from my deck that blue-eyes white dragon and slap it down and have one of my beautiful boys be like, oh

16:29.720 --> 16:31.720
Okay, that would be so sick

16:31.720 --> 16:38.160
But here's how to live in a haunted house step one take a well-built guard dog like German Shepherd with you into the house now

16:38.160 --> 16:43.640
Hey, I know that this just step one like ghosts don't care about dogs

16:43.960 --> 16:45.960
What's the ghost gonna do?

16:46.000 --> 16:52.160
Like the dogs gonna bite the ghosts like come on dogs easily detect the presence of the spirits

16:52.160 --> 16:55.360
It will be daring to you also with the dog

16:55.920 --> 16:57.200
What?

16:57.200 --> 16:59.200
It will be daring to you also

16:59.920 --> 17:05.400
With the dog. Okay. Okay. I just feel like clearly and I think we can all agree

17:05.400 --> 17:09.120
Cats have much more of a connection to the spiritual world. Well, yes

17:09.120 --> 17:15.720
And so like if I was going to take a guard animal in with me, it would be a powerful kitty cat

17:15.960 --> 17:20.880
Yeah, but the cat the loyalty there is a question. There's a definite

17:20.880 --> 17:26.600
There's a definite issue of like will they just be like, oh nice ghosts. No, that's fair. That's a good point

17:26.600 --> 17:33.600
Yeah, right away. I would want a big and I would want like a like an elephant or a rhinoceros something that like good

17:33.600 --> 17:38.520
Yeah, cuz you can't see these thing. You can't see these dudes. So you want like something big that can

17:39.080 --> 17:42.640
You know law of large numbers eventually is gonna impale him on his big

17:42.880 --> 17:45.960
You know what if we're gonna do that, then just give me a drill bit Taylor

17:46.000 --> 17:52.200
Give me a drill bit Taylor big old beefy Owen Wilson to go in in front of me to protect me from God

17:52.200 --> 17:55.600
He looked so big and strong in that so fucking ripped in that man

17:56.720 --> 17:58.560
Look like he ate Luke

17:58.560 --> 18:05.120
Remind yourself that before you move anything into the house walk through the entire place doing this will give the ghosts a chance to scope

18:05.120 --> 18:07.760
You out and accept your presence in their home. I

18:09.000 --> 18:14.240
Did buy it. Yeah, that's the thing is that buying a house is

18:15.680 --> 18:17.680
virtually impossible

18:18.080 --> 18:23.080
today and so if that does happen and you've jumped through the

18:23.960 --> 18:25.960
infinite hurdles that are

18:25.960 --> 18:30.700
Terrible society is created between you and a home

18:31.300 --> 18:36.420
I don't think I'm going to have much patience for a spectral hurdle

18:36.420 --> 18:43.500
Yes, a dead a dead person who like already had their chance and frankly blew it. Correct?

18:44.100 --> 18:49.940
Because they died like you had a chance to be the resident of this house and you fucked up

18:49.940 --> 18:55.060
You know what Griffin you have you have just enlightened me made me realize how much like having a landlord

18:55.060 --> 19:01.340
is like living in a haunted house where just like sometimes you come home and you're like wait something's different or like

19:01.500 --> 19:04.300
Like you're like, should I fix that like no, we don't change anything

19:04.300 --> 19:09.740
Yeah, if we if we change something they'll get mad and this is just sort of like a little

19:10.140 --> 19:17.500
Marie Kondo tip from me from yours truly to you is that you should walk through the whole house

19:18.500 --> 19:20.500
Before you move anything into the house

19:20.500 --> 19:26.380
Maybe before you buy it before you buy it even like you should you should see the whole house

19:26.380 --> 19:30.700
I think before because otherwise you're just gonna like carry in a couch and then be like

19:31.340 --> 19:34.980
This room looks this room seems like a good couch room. That's not a good way

19:34.980 --> 19:39.180
Or you can walk a bike. There's no floor. I should have looked first. I should have made sure this house

19:39.180 --> 19:40.200
I floors

19:40.200 --> 19:45.900
Remember before moving all your stuff into the place move in as few items as possible at first this will avoid riling the ghost

19:45.900 --> 19:52.660
Parentheses s ghosts to the changes going on during the transition from former occupants. Sorry ghosts

19:52.660 --> 19:59.340
I only got my friends one pizza. I'm not doing pizza again for them. We gotta get everything in on this one Saturday

19:59.340 --> 20:05.100
I got my dad's truck and my dad normally uses that truck on Saturdays and he rearranges schedule

20:05.100 --> 20:08.740
I don't know what to tell you ghost. Do you have a truck? No

20:09.820 --> 20:14.820
If it's a malevolent spirit like the ghost of a mummy or something like that. Yeah

20:14.820 --> 20:22.300
Oh, that's the one then they're gonna be watching you like a hawk. And so I do actually think there is some great wisdom to

20:23.060 --> 20:28.740
Bringing in the credenza first and then like the two ghosts the two mummy goes on your house being like I'm gonna fuck this

20:28.740 --> 20:34.420
Dude's whole day up. But then the other one would be like Josh. It's a credenza like yeah, it's just a credenza

20:34.420 --> 20:39.080
He's not gonna do but then you slowly like the next day. Maybe you bring in a futon

20:39.080 --> 20:44.440
And you know murder by a thousand cuts which which is how most ghosts

20:44.880 --> 20:50.300
Are made keep in mind while moving furniture or other objects in be alert for any feelings

20:50.300 --> 20:52.600
You may have about where an item should be placed

20:52.600 --> 20:56.200
Yeah, if you can make a ghost happy by placing a chair in a particular space

20:56.200 --> 21:02.600
It could save you lots of trouble later on. Okay, so I guess they're saying that your feelings will mimic the ghosts

21:03.480 --> 21:06.360
Feelings I guess like be aware of your feelings

21:06.360 --> 21:09.560
Oh, okay. Hey, hey wiki how article

21:09.560 --> 21:14.960
Are you saying that if my house wasn't haunted and I put a chair somewhere and I said I fucking hate this

21:16.080 --> 21:20.300
Keeping that chair right there. This is this is the kitchen

21:21.920 --> 21:26.120
Without any ghosts around there's no reason to not put a chair where I hate it

21:27.520 --> 21:32.400
Well, we're carrying this couch through the kitchen to get to the family room, but I feel happy

21:32.400 --> 21:36.880
So set it down because that's a ghost telling me that

21:38.080 --> 21:42.840
Are you sure you don't want to just put the couch down? No, no, this is ghost feelings

21:43.160 --> 21:48.320
Yeah, you don't even live here Doug. Just with the coach couch down. It's good

21:50.240 --> 21:55.160
Try to relate to the ghost by talking about what life may have been like in the house if it is an old house and try

21:55.160 --> 22:00.400
To do something former residents would have done in the house while they live there like eating some meals in a formal dining room or listening

22:00.400 --> 22:02.440
To period music from the time the house was built

22:02.440 --> 22:07.760
I feel like we've we that has come up in a different like dealing with ghosts scenario wiki

22:07.760 --> 22:11.100
How because we have definitely talked about that if you try to say like I bet

22:11.280 --> 22:16.880
Well, you had a hard time with the plague because like fuck off dude, like you weren't there

22:16.880 --> 22:19.600
I don't wanna hear it. No, but they're taught not talking about that

22:19.600 --> 22:22.680
They're talking about get out the get out the the old, you know

22:23.080 --> 22:28.800
Phonograph and should throw down the fucking Charleston and you will hear ghosts just like yes

22:28.800 --> 22:30.800
Yes

22:31.080 --> 22:33.040
Fuck yes, it's

22:33.040 --> 22:40.040
2022 what if it's a ghost from the 90s or something who are like what the fuck play some like where's my disk master?

22:40.140 --> 22:45.200
Come on, man. Okay. Well, then you're gonna need sort of a now. That's what I have called music

22:51.180 --> 22:55.920
But to the next point Travis try to talk about big events that would have happened while past owners would have been living here

22:55.920 --> 23:01.160
For example on October 29th of a year try to talk about how past residents would have felt about the stock market crash in the beginning

23:01.160 --> 23:03.160
Of the Great Depression

23:05.760 --> 23:09.280
How do you think I became a ghost you dick, yeah

23:09.800 --> 23:14.720
Yeah, you know what? You can just you just play we didn't start the fire and if they're from that

23:15.040 --> 23:17.800
Like that era they're gonna fucking love it

23:18.280 --> 23:22.880
But this wiki article sounds like it wants specific day-to-day trivia

23:22.880 --> 23:26.640
Yeah, it could be cool if you're just like sitting in your bedroom and ghost hovers up beside you

23:26.640 --> 23:32.960
But okay, let's take a look October 10th. Hey, it's Susan Sarandon's birthday. Like the ghost is gonna fucking love that. Yeah flip

23:33.360 --> 23:34.920
That's very grounding for me

23:34.920 --> 23:35.720
Thank you

23:35.720 --> 23:41.600
Avoid the area the ghost is in if they are in one particular place try using the room as a storage area and leave the ghost

23:41.600 --> 23:43.600
Alone. Oh, yeah, the ghost will love that

23:44.080 --> 23:50.360
That's like a mystery to that scenario of air wiki hell. Yeah. Yeah. Here's my broken rowing machine

23:50.360 --> 23:54.040
You sleep in the room with that now idiot also wiki how?

23:54.640 --> 24:00.480
Don't like I shouldn't don't like it shouldn't have died if I can pinpoint where the ghost is

24:01.200 --> 24:08.600
Yeah, I think I've got a lot more going on here than where to put like where to put the good TV or whatever

24:08.760 --> 24:15.080
If it's like on the ghost also ghost ain't gonna stay in that one room. It's a ghost. Yeah, it moves around

24:15.760 --> 24:18.080
Does the ghost do you think goes have to stay in your house?

24:18.080 --> 24:19.680
house

24:19.680 --> 24:25.200
We've definitely talked about this before but yes, I mean if you we I don't maybe it's been a while

24:25.200 --> 24:28.000
I think that there should be a rule that if it's been like three years

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
We're allowed to talk about the same shit again

24:30.000 --> 24:35.000
Cuz I feel like there's only so many things but if you see a ghost on the street that would fuck me up

24:35.000 --> 24:38.460
I need them to be in a I need them to be contained inside of

24:39.120 --> 24:42.960
Buildings. Well, the only way if they have very strong feelings about that Street

24:42.960 --> 24:49.000
If they were like a crossing guard to like lived to protect that corner, I could see that happening

24:49.000 --> 24:53.900
Yeah, but that's it. That's the only way but I don't want to try to spend a night and the old haunting

24:54.360 --> 24:57.520
Dickerson mansion and then like make it to 1 a.m

24:57.520 --> 25:01.440
And just be so freaked the fuck out that I have to get out of there and I run away

25:01.760 --> 25:08.220
But then old man Dickerson is like floating with me like on my block and I'm like, what are you doing?

25:08.220 --> 25:14.120
Like I got out of the house. He's like so what like so what I'm bored. I follow you now

25:14.200 --> 25:16.840
But I think it would also be pretty positive experience though

25:16.840 --> 25:19.680
If there's someone was like yeah, this house is haunted and you spend all night there

25:19.680 --> 25:23.040
You're like, I don't see any ghosts in here and you look outside and there's like a ghost on the lawn

25:23.040 --> 25:26.080
And you're like I live with that. That's actually that's fine. He's out there

25:26.080 --> 25:27.760
Hey, try to spend a night in the place

25:27.760 --> 25:32.040
Some goes try to communicate with the living through dreams the line that goes to get its message through to the living may put it

25:32.040 --> 25:36.240
Into the haunting and send the ghost on its way. I would say if you buy a house try to spend a night in a place

25:36.240 --> 25:38.240
Hey

25:39.840 --> 25:41.280
Give it a shot

25:41.280 --> 25:47.500
It's worth it's worth an attempt. I hey slow down your jet-set lifestyles really keeping you away from your house

25:48.520 --> 25:51.880
365 nights a year try sleeping that place at least

25:53.120 --> 25:55.700
Yeah, you have you have a family that

25:57.200 --> 26:02.500
Sleep in the house. Yeah the house except the ghost while this may be difficult for some to do

26:02.500 --> 26:06.600
Most ghosts will leave you alone if you acknowledge their presence like, okay, you lift it up

26:06.920 --> 26:13.120
My whole dining table to the ceiling and then you dropped it. So I saw that I saw that okay, like

26:15.800 --> 26:20.960
Heard all day heard got it. Thank you. You're there you are there talk to the ghost

26:20.960 --> 26:23.520
Let it know it is welcome to stay if it leaves you and your family alone

26:24.240 --> 26:27.200
That's a slippery slope. I think why?

26:27.200 --> 26:32.360
I just feel it just feels like if they slip up. Does that mean like

26:35.160 --> 26:38.680
Spam email it's like, okay. Yes, and I'm not gonna reach out to you anymore

26:39.440 --> 26:44.240
Yeah, and then what before you know it like more ghosts show up and you're like, hey and he's like

26:44.240 --> 26:51.520
I'm how is me having a ghost party that you can't even vibe with aside from like if you walk through one of us you

26:51.520 --> 26:53.000
Get cold

26:53.000 --> 26:58.160
Like how is that bothering you? Like how am I being a nuisance to you right now?

26:58.160 --> 27:05.560
A living person also old to think that the concern here is that ghost doesn't know if it's allowed to stay or not

27:05.560 --> 27:10.040
Yeah, the narrative here is really shifting but let's end it with this last bit

27:10.040 --> 27:13.880
which is remember if the ghost does something scary, let it know you are upset and

27:14.320 --> 27:18.680
That if such behavior continues, it will not be tolerated. So so just like

27:18.680 --> 27:25.720
Ah, no, no, no. Hey, listen, everyone's allowed to get frustrated. I understand that you're frustrated

27:25.720 --> 27:33.040
I get that you're allowed to be frustrated, but we do not swing the dog around the room while going blue. That's not okay

27:33.040 --> 27:37.100
That's not how we express our feelings. Do you understand? Hey, look at me. Hey, we're talking

27:37.100 --> 27:41.040
Are you listen? What did I just say? Not we do not make a gooey portal on the ceiling

27:41.040 --> 27:45.980
Okay, and pull and pull the little girl through it and then she gets in the TV now. Do you understand me?

27:45.980 --> 27:51.300
Do you hear me? Do you want to sit down? Do you want to sit on the no-no step? Yep ghost

27:51.300 --> 27:56.260
Do you want to be in the no-no crypt? You're going in the no-no crypt ghost because you are not listening

27:56.260 --> 28:00.740
We're trying to do it. I see you. I see your eyes. That's a good choice. You made a good choice

28:02.460 --> 28:04.220
Thank you ghost

28:04.220 --> 28:11.300
See ghost I I love you so much and it's and it's why I'm not like I'm just disappointed I guess

28:12.140 --> 28:14.740
Listen, I think I think there's no such thing as a bad ghost

28:14.740 --> 28:21.420
I think there's just a ghost that makes bad choices. You know, let's make choices around here. And yeah, we can watch some iPad

28:21.420 --> 28:23.420
What do you want to watch?

28:25.820 --> 28:27.140
So

28:27.140 --> 28:29.500
Yeah, there's not really any good questions after this

28:29.500 --> 28:33.500
A lot of people have because we we really have plumbed the depths at this point

28:33.500 --> 28:39.740
And I don't know that there's much else to like if there's more to say about ghosts like we'll be the ones to discover it

28:39.740 --> 28:45.220
Yeah, I mean not something on wiki how but that's just that's just how to live in haunted houses. You got to talk to the

28:45.220 --> 28:48.820
Ghost about all the cool stuff that's happened since the 1930s

28:48.820 --> 28:52.980
But then also don't talk to the ghost and don't go near it. Let it have its space

28:52.980 --> 28:59.580
But if it does try to fuck around then it's tell it it'll kill it again or whatever that ghost. Hey

29:00.100 --> 29:01.940
You know what? No one talks about

29:01.940 --> 29:07.180
The ghost flickers the lights and shit and like makes cold spots and it's like hey, man

29:07.180 --> 29:12.500
That's my electric bill and my heating bill. Could you not like you please not?

29:13.220 --> 29:19.280
Hey, you're scaring me. That's fine. You're messing with my financial. I just bought a house. Do you know how hard that is? Yeah

29:20.260 --> 29:24.060
Anyway, that's um, that's ghosts. I'm having people over to my apartment for Halloween

29:24.060 --> 29:29.380
And I've realized that I don't know any good ghost stories to tell I want to set the tone for the evening with something

29:29.780 --> 29:34.880
Scary spooky, but I'm at a loss. Do you have any good ghost stories? I can use

29:34.880 --> 29:37.800
alternatively, do you have a formula for a

29:39.840 --> 29:45.560
Badass ghost story cursing that's from uninspired in Arizona a

29:46.280 --> 29:47.960
badass ghost story

29:47.960 --> 29:53.760
Cool, like like a cool ghost story. I think that no matter what I like the idea of a formula

29:53.760 --> 29:56.560
I don't like the idea of sitting here and trying to come up with a ghost story

29:56.560 --> 30:01.560
That sounds like comedy boys into me, but I mean the formulas formula we can work with formula simple, right?

30:01.560 --> 30:03.360
It's got to start with something like oh, you know

30:03.360 --> 30:08.400
It was blank years ago. Now. This is where it's tough, right? It can't be two

30:11.520 --> 30:13.520
Six months back in March

30:15.440 --> 30:18.500
You've lived here since January, yeah, I know I was

30:21.160 --> 30:25.720
I didn't tell you about this because not only is this a badass scary ghost story. It's an embarrassing one

30:25.720 --> 30:30.760
It also can't be so long ago. You can't be like 500 years ago on this very spot someone

30:30.760 --> 30:32.760
Sure

30:33.360 --> 30:35.360
Absolutely, let's just pick a year

30:36.600 --> 30:38.600
230 right

30:38.760 --> 30:42.920
Too far. That's way too far 100. It was a it was 83

30:43.640 --> 30:45.160
It has to be a round number

30:45.160 --> 30:50.160
I think cuz then it also it's like for some reason it's like a hundred years ago and goes like who an anniversary

30:50.160 --> 30:53.920
What about what about one and you're like, let me tell you about the Holy Ghost

30:53.920 --> 31:00.880
He's this guy that's pretty scary actually I did just get scared of being at a party and not happening

31:00.880 --> 31:04.240
You know scary means life without him. So that's the beginning

31:04.960 --> 31:07.560
That's the beginning obviously the end of the story

31:07.800 --> 31:13.160
No matter what a common great element for a badass ghost story is if you keel over dead

31:13.160 --> 31:17.700
Yeah at the end of the story and a ghost comes out of your body and like

31:18.360 --> 31:22.640
And screams like happy Halloween and like flips over the table

31:22.640 --> 31:27.640
Yeah, okay. It was a hundred years ago and you had to drop down that at the end. Yes

31:27.640 --> 31:32.060
Now, let me take it a little different. Okay, it starts like this. Hmm. Okay, it was

31:33.800 --> 31:40.060
1989 years ago and a man he was put he died and he was buried but then

31:40.560 --> 31:44.040
Three days later. He came back from the grave

31:44.600 --> 31:46.600
read this literature

31:46.600 --> 31:53.880
Oh pretty scary. Okay. I am so distracted. I'm so distracted by the fact that you set this

31:56.280 --> 31:59.480
Bit in 1989. No, it was

32:00.120 --> 32:05.300
1989 years ago. Yeah, right because he died when he was 33 Justin so it couldn't be

32:05.960 --> 32:09.140
2022 years ago. I did you I did you the math?

32:11.200 --> 32:14.760
Travis is we record with camera now and I Travis went to a

32:14.760 --> 32:16.760
Sunken place. Yeah

32:18.720 --> 32:22.640
99 and that wasn't it. That was when Jesus had a righteous 23

32:24.800 --> 32:26.800
The calendar begins on the exact day

32:28.200 --> 32:30.200
Yeah

32:31.240 --> 32:33.240
Any other good ghost story

32:35.280 --> 32:39.720
One thing that I always think is very impactful and ghost stories is that

32:40.520 --> 32:43.560
Someone is eating something that turns out to be a body part

32:43.560 --> 32:44.720
Oh

32:44.720 --> 32:46.520
Yeah, I mean like and yeah

32:46.520 --> 32:53.280
And the payoff is always like this is I think the moment right before the death of fright is like and it was fingers

32:53.280 --> 32:55.640
Oh, that's yeah. Sure. Sure. Sure. I

32:56.600 --> 33:00.160
Know this is excellent. It was a hundred years ago. Uh-huh

33:01.320 --> 33:03.320
Something something something

33:03.720 --> 33:06.280
and it was fingers and then

33:07.440 --> 33:09.320
Dad dad

33:09.320 --> 33:15.480
It helps if it's like relatable if it sounds like it happened to someone like that, you know, or like someone and so like just

33:15.480 --> 33:18.880
Point at anyone in the room and be like they were there they can tell you

33:19.000 --> 33:25.160
Yeah, and then when they deny it be like, maybe you're the ghost, right? That's cool. Like a second person sort of

33:26.240 --> 33:27.640
horror story

33:27.640 --> 33:32.140
Justin almost drink the back. I almost drink the back. You really need to tight tighten and it was fingers. Oh

33:33.120 --> 33:38.400
Wait, is there something in this bad coffee? Is there something in this this? Oh, yes

33:38.400 --> 33:42.760
They open to the universe bringing ideas to you a hundred years ago

33:42.760 --> 33:49.520
I threw a party in their apartment that was and everybody everybody drank the punch

33:49.800 --> 33:55.520
But he had put poison in it and kind of like this punch that you've all been drinking

33:55.520 --> 34:00.240
Let's let's say it was my uncle. Yeah years ago my uncle

34:00.240 --> 34:04.400
Yes, because no one's gonna challenge you on it cuz that would be rude cuz it's your uncle

34:04.400 --> 34:09.520
Yeah, my right is your uncle well enough to know if it really happened. My dad was a real lady

34:09.520 --> 34:13.180
No, not my baby. No, cuz my uncle was there a hundred years ago

34:13.680 --> 34:18.240
My uncle was 70 years old or to my dad 100 years ago. My uncle

34:18.880 --> 34:25.080
My very good. Okay 100 years ago my six-year-old uncle and then it's like yeah, cuz he's a hundred

34:27.520 --> 34:31.120
Yeah, he started living a good clean life and exercising

34:31.120 --> 34:34.680
No, but on a completely hold on on an unrelated

34:38.440 --> 34:43.120
He stopped eating chicken fingers cuz they were real fingers, okay, that's

34:45.080 --> 34:50.840
Dead a hundred years ago a hundred years ago my very young uncle

34:52.440 --> 34:54.480
This also sounds like a mnemonic device

34:54.480 --> 35:01.400
My very young uncle just ate chicken fingers then stop because they were human fingers

35:02.160 --> 35:05.960
But I never stopped eating the fingers and now I have cardiac problems

35:06.560 --> 35:10.100
You're yeah, but that's like it's what you just added like a post credits

35:11.080 --> 35:17.800
Scare that can't be after the end where you die right? Yeah, and I was the uncle the whole time and then you die of fright

35:18.240 --> 35:19.480
Okay

35:19.480 --> 35:24.920
Okay, then you die of fright. Yeah, that's gotta be and then you don't get up until everybody leaves the party

35:25.080 --> 35:28.360
Yeah, that's also important and what's cool is like on

35:29.400 --> 35:36.080
Different holidays you can use the story to use change different parts of it. Yeah, so like I so like for

35:37.040 --> 35:42.320
You know for around Christmastime you can be like is it so saying it's a hundred years ago

35:42.320 --> 35:50.640
Santa Claus and then something something something and then like be like he's eating fingers and then maybe you don't die

35:50.640 --> 35:55.240
At the end of that story cuz yeah, you become more alive. Let's take a quick break

35:56.400 --> 35:59.040
Travis I would prefer if you left. Oh

35:59.680 --> 36:04.640
Okay, I prefer Griffin and I do these alone. Can I come back after the money zone? Yes

36:04.640 --> 36:08.960
Yes, but I prefer that this money zone just be something for Griffin and I is that okay?

36:08.960 --> 36:12.440
I actually I need to use the rest. I need to use the restroom

36:13.200 --> 36:19.360
So maybe Justin does it alone? Oh Griffin, you guys will be recording this in the future while I'm in the UK

36:21.080 --> 36:25.780
Why do you need to I do need to go to the bathroom that's something you can just say as you

36:27.040 --> 36:31.680
Hold on. Let me hold on. Let me think about this. Hold on. Let me figure this out cuz

36:32.680 --> 36:36.240
We're recording this early because Travis is in the is not in America

36:36.240 --> 36:40.620
I've been right now. He is right now Travis in America. We're recording this

36:40.620 --> 36:45.740
Yes in the but in the episode when the episode comes out, he won't be in America. Sure. I need to pee now

36:45.740 --> 36:50.220
Yeah, just try to calculate. He wants to make sure he's not gonna piss on camera

36:53.300 --> 36:58.940
You can go pee now and then also when you adjust and report the money zone later if you need to pee then you can

36:58.940 --> 37:00.940
Also go pee that that's what I'm saying

37:00.940 --> 37:05.860
To the episode when it comes out and you get to this point the episode this exact point. Hi

37:05.860 --> 37:12.720
Yeah, you can pause your podcast layer and go pee then as well. Yeah, your options are limitless

37:12.920 --> 37:16.380
Yeah, there's no no cause for concern really

37:16.940 --> 37:22.180
But why wouldn't but why when we do that? Oh, we don't have ads. Sometimes they come in a little hot

37:22.180 --> 37:24.180
Huh? Is that what the situation? Yeah

37:24.180 --> 37:32.260
There's that's one way of putting it. I'm gonna flip it on you. We're recording early because we're so responsible. Oh, yeah

37:32.540 --> 37:36.740
Okay, and so I was setting up a thing where you and I will record that

37:36.740 --> 37:42.220
We're gonna do it alone because Travis isn't not in America. This isn't in Ohio. Okay, good

37:42.220 --> 37:57.140
Are you peeing your pants right now? You do have to tell me?

37:57.140 --> 38:04.780
Wow, what a great episode so far that we recorded a hundred years ago. This is Griffin. I'm flying solo for the ads today

38:04.780 --> 38:06.780
Let's see if I still remember how this thing works

38:07.540 --> 38:11.100
Squarespace is the all-in-one platform for building your brand and growing your business online

38:11.100 --> 38:17.580
You stand out with a beautiful website when you use it you engage with that audience of yours when you use it and you can sell

38:17.740 --> 38:23.740
Anything your heart could imagine your products content you create even your time sell your time

38:24.220 --> 38:27.860
Sell it like in the Justin Timberlake movie just in time

38:28.420 --> 38:34.980
Every Squarespace website and online store comes with a suite of integrated features and useful guides that help maximize prominence among search results

38:34.980 --> 38:38.180
So when people you know Google mark Ruffalo

38:38.180 --> 38:43.380
Jim shorts mark Ruffalo and Jim shorts and that's your website's gonna come up

38:43.820 --> 38:48.940
First if that's what it focuses on and you used Squarespace to make it

38:48.940 --> 38:54.040
You can sell pictures of mark Ruffalo and Jim shorts on an online store. Probably actually you can't do that because he

38:54.580 --> 38:56.220
He would probably come after you

38:56.220 --> 39:03.420
He's very litigious and they have powerful blogging tools you can use to share photos of mark Ruffalo wearing whatever he wears

39:04.160 --> 39:07.580
You can categorize share and schedule your post to make your content work for you

39:07.580 --> 39:13.780
we've used Squarespace to make all of our joke websites and some of our real websites and it could not be easier to use and

I have I've been buying some winter wear lately from brands online and

40:23.800 --> 40:28.040
winter wear is it can get kind of pricey I guess because they use more fabric and

40:28.360 --> 40:29.160
I

40:29.160 --> 40:35.120
Clicked the honey button and it found a little coupon code for me. I saved some bucks on it and I I did a celebration

It's a lot safer to do a dummy coming to life. That's on the next bullseye for maximum fun.org and NPR

41:28.840 --> 41:31.680

Don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't why is his room filling with smog and smoke?

41:39.200 --> 41:45.720

welcome to Munch School I've a hood to

42:08.220 --> 42:13.560
Did you see Count Donut Travis did it like you did it? That's wonderful. You're my hero. Welcome

42:13.560 --> 42:14.400
Welcome.

42:14.400 --> 42:15.240
It's a podcast.

42:15.240 --> 42:16.560
Look, when I do it, it's like a,

42:16.560 --> 42:18.080
like a, I'm gonna leave.

42:18.080 --> 42:19.320
Yeah, pretty good.

42:19.320 --> 42:20.160
Do you remember him?

42:20.160 --> 42:20.980
Very funny, Griffin.

42:20.980 --> 42:21.820
You ever watch that?

42:21.820 --> 42:22.660
Thanks.

42:22.660 --> 42:23.500
Aw.

42:23.500 --> 42:24.340
Thanks, Count Donut.

42:24.340 --> 42:27.920
One great Beavis and Butthead reference.

42:27.920 --> 42:29.080
Thanks, I love them.

42:29.080 --> 42:32.000
Welcome to Munch Squad, the podcast within a podcast

42:32.000 --> 42:35.880
that profiles the latest and greatest in brand eating.

42:37.520 --> 42:39.840
My name is Count Donut.

42:39.840 --> 42:40.720
We've established that.

42:40.720 --> 42:42.200
And I'm here to talk to you

42:42.200 --> 42:47.200
about the latest innovations in the donut space.

42:47.400 --> 42:51.120
Before I indulge,

42:51.120 --> 42:53.680
does anyone have anything they'd like to say?

42:54.560 --> 42:55.820
I like your beard.

42:55.820 --> 42:56.660
Sorry, happy birthday.

42:56.660 --> 42:58.360
Thank you, thank you, it's new.

42:58.360 --> 43:00.600
Now that is weird because I thought vampires

43:00.600 --> 43:02.880
don't like age or grow or change or anything.

43:02.880 --> 43:04.880
It's a Rogaine!

43:04.880 --> 43:08.480
I had it transplanted from somewhere else.

43:08.480 --> 43:09.320
Oh.

43:09.320 --> 43:11.600
When you said, it's a Rogaine just now,

43:11.600 --> 43:13.760
it's so fucking weird,

43:13.760 --> 43:17.060
but there's this other dude that comes around sometimes.

43:18.120 --> 43:21.120
I forget his name, it's something like Johnny Stink,

43:21.120 --> 43:24.120
but you sounded like him a little bit.

43:25.880 --> 43:26.780
Can I ask you a question?

43:26.780 --> 43:30.100
I've always wondered, Count Donut, is a vampire?

43:30.100 --> 43:32.740
Yes, let's dig into the lore.

43:32.740 --> 43:34.800
Obviously, as a vampire, you don't age,

43:34.800 --> 43:36.100
and so your hair wouldn't grow, right?

43:36.100 --> 43:37.060
Your body wouldn't make,

43:37.060 --> 43:39.800
so if you get a haircut and you don't like it,

43:39.800 --> 43:41.680
is it just, as you live forever,

43:41.680 --> 43:44.080
your hair cuts just get shorter and shorter

43:44.080 --> 43:46.080
until eventually all vampires shave their head

43:46.080 --> 43:48.200
bellowed like Nosferatu?

43:48.200 --> 43:53.200
No, Travis, the hair is grown,

43:54.120 --> 43:58.500
but fed with blood, so I swallow the blood,

43:58.500 --> 44:03.080
and then my excretions are through my follicles.

44:03.080 --> 44:03.920
His hair.

44:03.920 --> 44:07.400
But then your cells are making more hair,

44:07.400 --> 44:08.240
which means they're aging.

44:08.240 --> 44:10.720
No, I'm directly excreting.

44:10.720 --> 44:11.560
He pushes them out.

44:11.560 --> 44:13.240
Oh, like a Play-Doh fun thing.

44:13.240 --> 44:16.960
Like a Play-Doh fun guy, yes, like a Play-Doh fun guy.

44:16.960 --> 44:17.800
That makes all sense now.

44:17.800 --> 44:20.280
Let's talk about Pink Box.

44:20.280 --> 44:21.120
Like what?

44:21.120 --> 44:23.360
And you ate that last word, Donut.

44:23.360 --> 44:24.180
Let me try again.

44:24.180 --> 44:26.680
Let's talk about Pink Box.

44:26.680 --> 44:27.520
Pink Box?

44:27.520 --> 44:28.360
Pink Box?

44:28.360 --> 44:29.200
Pink Box, it's a frequent.

44:29.200 --> 44:30.560
That can't be.

44:30.560 --> 44:35.560
Yes, it's a donut manufacturer based in the Las Vegas area.

44:36.160 --> 44:37.600
Oh, of course it is.

44:37.600 --> 44:42.400
Ghouls, goblins, and donut lovers alike

44:42.400 --> 44:43.240
can get into this.

44:43.240 --> 44:46.360
I'm glad that they've stopped being stuck in a binary.

44:46.360 --> 44:48.000
Good job, Pink Box.

44:48.000 --> 44:48.840
Well done, Pink Box.

44:48.840 --> 44:52.880
Everybody, yes, can enjoy the spirit of Halloween

44:52.880 --> 44:57.880
with these not so scary, but oh so delicious treats.

44:57.920 --> 44:58.760
Be sure to stop.

44:58.760 --> 45:00.520
Don't waste my time with this, Pink Box.

45:00.520 --> 45:02.640
Scare my pants off with your baked goods, please.

45:02.640 --> 45:05.840
For stop, Dean, if you just want a very long list

45:05.840 --> 45:09.440
of creepy donuts of varying degrees of sanity,

45:09.440 --> 45:11.440
Pink Box has you covered.

45:11.440 --> 45:12.360
Oh, good.

45:12.360 --> 45:16.520
First up is the Vampire, which I said like Bill

45:16.520 --> 45:20.240
from True Blood for reasons that defy explanation.

45:20.240 --> 45:25.240
Vampire, it's a glazed raised ring with vampire teeth toy

45:25.800 --> 45:27.600
and vampire decor.

45:27.600 --> 45:29.400
Where, in the hole?

45:29.400 --> 45:30.240
Where is it?

45:30.240 --> 45:34.160
Did they give the whole, did they give the whole teeth?

45:34.160 --> 45:35.960
And they're not like edible teeth, right?

45:35.960 --> 45:38.600
These are plastic toy teeth.

45:38.600 --> 45:40.920
Please remove them before eating.

45:40.920 --> 45:44.640
I'll have my assistant, Beulah, pull up an image for you.

45:44.640 --> 45:46.520
One moment, Beulah.

45:46.520 --> 45:48.160
Well, this is new canon.

45:48.160 --> 45:49.720
Yeah, I don't know how I feel.

45:49.720 --> 45:50.560
Beulah!

45:50.560 --> 45:52.400
Is this like a familiar situation?

45:52.400 --> 45:54.400
Did she pay you? The donuts!

45:54.400 --> 45:56.000
Yeah, actually, I see a little rat

45:56.000 --> 45:57.280
and it's typing on a keyboard.

45:57.280 --> 45:58.360
I actually love that. I don't know why

45:58.360 --> 45:59.560
she can't make it bigger.

45:59.560 --> 46:01.360
Okay, so we're looking at all the donuts right here.

46:01.360 --> 46:02.920
I'm trying to, oh, okay. Don't skip ahead.

46:02.920 --> 46:05.080
You see the vampire teeth.

46:05.080 --> 46:07.160
Vampire donut.

46:07.160 --> 46:08.200
Next up.

46:08.200 --> 46:10.680
Oh, it does have a little bit more decoration

46:10.680 --> 46:12.400
than just shoving some fake teeth in it.

46:12.400 --> 46:13.960
Yeah, it's not just a glazed donut

46:13.960 --> 46:15.400
with teeth in the hole.

46:15.400 --> 46:16.400
It's adorable.

46:16.400 --> 46:17.960
Vampire pool!

46:19.040 --> 46:21.880
It's a chocolate cake topped with chocolate buttercream

46:21.880 --> 46:23.800
covered with chocolate icing.

46:23.800 --> 46:26.520
Halloween sprinkles and vampire decor

46:26.520 --> 46:28.720
and it looks like human fecal.

46:28.720 --> 46:33.240
Wait, hold on. Did you say vampire?

46:33.240 --> 46:34.760
Human fecal matter!

46:34.760 --> 46:35.680
No, no, no, no, no, no.

46:35.680 --> 46:38.440
The name of the, I thought you said vampire pool.

46:38.440 --> 46:40.520
No, vampire pool.

46:40.520 --> 46:43.120
And not the bear, the black bear.

46:43.120 --> 46:44.120
Isn't it funny how he looks funny, though?

46:44.120 --> 46:45.880
Did you also think he said pool, Travis?

46:45.880 --> 46:46.720
I did.

46:46.720 --> 46:48.520
Vampire pool!

46:49.600 --> 46:50.440
Okay.

46:50.440 --> 46:52.760
Wouldn't vampire poo just be blood?

46:52.760 --> 46:54.200
What it is is, yes.

46:54.200 --> 46:55.760
Oh, no, hair. We've covered.

46:55.760 --> 47:00.400
Wait, hair comes out everywhere.

47:00.400 --> 47:01.680
Not just the top of your head.

47:01.680 --> 47:03.720
Vision pumpkin!

47:03.720 --> 47:08.600
Orange frosted raised shell topped with pumpkin decor.

47:08.600 --> 47:09.440
That one's great.

47:09.440 --> 47:10.680
That's a dead-on pumpkin.

47:10.680 --> 47:11.920
I see that. That looks great.

47:11.920 --> 47:12.760
And you know what?

47:12.760 --> 47:13.760
What's great about that?

47:13.760 --> 47:16.000
Remove the little pumpkin leaf on the top.

47:16.000 --> 47:17.240
You can use that for March Madness.

47:17.240 --> 47:18.200
That's a basketball, baby.

47:18.200 --> 47:19.920
That's a basketball right there.

47:19.920 --> 47:23.000
I want now to continue to draw you through

47:23.000 --> 47:25.240
my tunnel of horrors.

47:25.240 --> 47:28.560
Next up, and Travis, I apologize in advance,

47:28.560 --> 47:31.280
for spider ring!

47:31.280 --> 47:32.600
It's actually very cute.

47:32.600 --> 47:33.440
It is a pretty cute little bag.

47:33.440 --> 47:35.200
It's a purple frosted vanilla cake top

47:35.200 --> 47:38.560
with spider web decor and a spider ring!

47:38.560 --> 47:40.440
Oh, that one.

47:40.440 --> 47:42.000
Yeah, that does nothing for me.

47:42.000 --> 47:44.400
Creepy crawler.

47:44.400 --> 47:49.280
Orange frosted raised ring topped with glazed cake peewees

47:49.280 --> 47:51.880
and spider decor!

47:51.880 --> 47:53.040
That one I like.

47:53.040 --> 47:54.240
That one's pretty cute, too.

47:54.240 --> 47:55.080
I like, actually.

47:55.080 --> 47:57.280
That one is called I See You,

47:57.280 --> 47:59.960
and it's a white frosted dough crow

47:59.960 --> 48:02.520
topped with eyeball decor.

48:02.520 --> 48:03.360
Well, that was fun.

48:03.360 --> 48:06.160
Dough crow, by the way, I believe dough crow.

48:08.440 --> 48:12.240
I believed when they realized crow nut was trademarked.

48:12.240 --> 48:14.880
They took some other scraps of the word.

48:14.880 --> 48:18.160
Because dough salt is also definitely taken.

48:18.160 --> 48:20.200
Dough salt is taken, so they just got in there

48:20.200 --> 48:22.200
and squished it all around.

48:22.200 --> 48:26.320
Like my good friend Frankenstein.

48:26.320 --> 48:27.640
Hey, I just want everyone to know

48:27.640 --> 48:30.080
that I didn't see the real vampire doughnut,

48:30.080 --> 48:31.400
and now I'm back to hating it,

48:31.400 --> 48:32.960
because it is just a glazed doughnut

48:32.960 --> 48:36.040
with teeth in the hole and two googly eyes on top of that.

48:36.040 --> 48:38.320
They can make the teeth whatever color they want.

48:38.320 --> 48:41.920
It still is a screaming doughnut that bites,

48:41.920 --> 48:43.960
that does bite back, and it's miserable.

48:43.960 --> 48:45.880
But I do want Count Doughnut to keep going,

48:45.880 --> 48:46.920
because there's a couple on here

48:46.920 --> 48:49.560
that definitely don't seem connected to Halloween

48:49.560 --> 48:51.440
in any way. No, not at all.

48:51.440 --> 48:53.360
Next up is Boo.

48:53.360 --> 48:57.000
It's a white frosted raised ghost filled with orange-

48:57.000 --> 49:00.120
Snooze, snort, yeah, fine, yeah, we see it, next.

49:00.120 --> 49:04.320
White, I'm going to tell you the description of this one.

49:04.320 --> 49:07.320
White frosted raised shell filled with lemon whip

49:07.320 --> 49:10.640
and topped with Jack Skellington decor.

49:10.640 --> 49:12.160
Now, I mention only this

49:12.160 --> 49:16.160
because the name of this doughnut is Jack Lemon, which-

49:16.160 --> 49:19.000
Ha! Ha!

49:19.000 --> 49:21.560
Which to me is such a strange choice.

49:21.560 --> 49:23.560
Ha! Ha! Ha!

49:23.560 --> 49:25.480
They must have known, it's so specific,

49:25.480 --> 49:26.600
it has to be a reference.

49:26.600 --> 49:28.800
This is the only reason you would choose this name,

49:28.800 --> 49:32.680
is Jack Lemon, who died in 2001.

49:32.680 --> 49:35.480
This is the grumpier old doughnut.

49:35.480 --> 49:37.640
Grumpy old doughnut.

49:37.640 --> 49:41.440
Not even someone I would connect to Halloween.

49:41.440 --> 49:44.360
This man was in a movie with Marilyn Monroe.

49:44.360 --> 49:46.520
You can't name a doughnut that.

49:46.520 --> 49:50.040
So there's no way Pink Box got the rights to Jack Skellington.

49:50.040 --> 49:53.000
They get the rights to Jack Skellington and Jack Lemon

49:53.000 --> 49:55.200
for reasons that defy explanation.

49:55.200 --> 49:57.440
Why is it called Jack Lemon?

49:57.440 --> 49:58.280
Hmm.

49:59.360 --> 50:02.480
The loopy Halloween, orange frosted raised bars

50:02.480 --> 50:05.480
topped with fruit loops and Captain Crunch.

50:05.480 --> 50:07.520
Yeah, that's the one that's just like,

50:07.520 --> 50:09.240
they had some of those-

50:09.240 --> 50:11.800
It looks like a coffin for a clown.

50:11.800 --> 50:12.720
Okay.

50:12.720 --> 50:14.920
Oh, that would have called it the clown coffin.

50:14.920 --> 50:16.600
That would have been something.

50:16.600 --> 50:19.040
But there's 13 doughnuts on here.

50:19.040 --> 50:20.360
Frankie bar.

50:20.360 --> 50:21.920
They did not need that one.

50:21.920 --> 50:25.960
They did not need this mini green frosted raised bar

50:25.960 --> 50:28.520
filled with Frankenstein decor.

50:28.520 --> 50:31.440
Then there's strawberry mummy.

50:31.440 --> 50:33.400
Strawberry frosted raised bar with mummy decor

50:33.400 --> 50:35.240
and the Halloween mummy.

50:35.240 --> 50:37.320
A chocolate frosted raised shovel with cookies and cream

50:37.320 --> 50:39.800
topped with Oreo crumble and mummy decor.

50:39.800 --> 50:41.120
And then lastly, at the end,

50:41.120 --> 50:44.120
there's one called It's Your Birthday.

50:44.120 --> 50:45.440
It's Your Birthday.

50:45.440 --> 50:48.120
It's Your Birthday.

50:48.120 --> 50:50.560
They don't want kids whose birthday it is.

50:52.080 --> 50:54.960
You know, so many kids with Halloween birthdays,

50:54.960 --> 50:57.560
they don't get anything.

50:57.560 --> 50:58.400
They get nothing.

50:58.400 --> 50:59.240
They get no recognition.

50:59.240 --> 51:00.920
They get no attention.

51:00.920 --> 51:03.320
But now Pink Box says, It's Your Birthday.

51:03.320 --> 51:04.160
It's Your Birthday.

51:04.160 --> 51:05.000
That's so good.

51:05.000 --> 51:05.840
That's great.

51:05.840 --> 51:06.680
Thanks, Pink Box.

51:06.680 --> 51:08.200
And thanks to me.

51:08.200 --> 51:09.040
Thanks.

51:09.040 --> 51:12.280
As you know, I can only live for one night a year.

51:12.280 --> 51:13.280
What?

51:13.280 --> 51:16.600
Yes, this is the one day I could walk about the Earth.

51:16.600 --> 51:18.160
And you stayed with us.

51:18.160 --> 51:20.080
And I spent it with you.

51:20.080 --> 51:21.360
What are you gonna do next?

51:21.360 --> 51:22.280
I don't really, I don't pity you

51:22.280 --> 51:26.120
because for you, that time, you don't feel that time.

51:26.120 --> 51:26.960
You know?

51:26.960 --> 51:27.800
It's like seven.

51:27.800 --> 51:28.640
Well, you assume that, Griffin.

51:28.640 --> 51:29.480
Hold on.

51:29.480 --> 51:30.320
You assume that?

51:30.320 --> 51:33.440
You go to sleep midnight 2022, Halloween.

51:33.440 --> 51:36.200
You wake up, you know, 12.01.

51:36.200 --> 51:40.280
I walk the Earth every night trying the donuts

51:40.280 --> 51:45.200
that always cause me to retch immediately afterwards.

51:45.200 --> 51:46.040
And the hair comes out.

51:46.040 --> 51:47.920
Because I cannot tolerate them,

51:47.920 --> 51:49.560
despite my love for them.

51:49.560 --> 51:53.160
But this is the day that I could walk amongst the sunlight.

51:53.160 --> 51:54.000
Yeah.

51:54.000 --> 51:55.080
Oh.

51:55.080 --> 51:56.880
That makes, I understand now.

51:56.880 --> 51:59.520
You should check out an aquarium if you have time.

51:59.520 --> 52:01.680
Yeah, do you know about like human stuff?

52:02.680 --> 52:05.600
Sorry, what is an aquarium?

52:05.600 --> 52:08.000
An aquarium is like a fish prison.

52:08.000 --> 52:08.840
Yeah.

52:08.840 --> 52:09.720
What is, wait, hold on.

52:09.720 --> 52:11.360
A water zoo.

52:11.360 --> 52:13.600
What is a fish?

52:13.600 --> 52:15.760
Oh, well, this is actually really interesting

52:15.760 --> 52:17.480
because there's not a scientific class.

52:17.480 --> 52:18.360
Water kills me.

52:18.360 --> 52:22.560
So I, but like, well, water kills me.

52:22.560 --> 52:25.240
So I have never seen a fish.

52:25.240 --> 52:26.240
Okay.

52:26.240 --> 52:27.800
Now wait, hold on, hold on, hold on.

52:27.800 --> 52:29.200
Not even like in a book?

52:29.200 --> 52:31.560
Or like when you were alive at some point

52:31.560 --> 52:32.640
before you got turned.

52:32.640 --> 52:33.520
What would I read?

52:33.520 --> 52:34.360
Why would I read?

52:34.360 --> 52:35.440
Why need I read?

52:35.440 --> 52:38.640
But you didn't start off as like this spectral form, right?

52:38.640 --> 52:39.840
You were alive at some point.

52:39.840 --> 52:41.960
I don't know why you're trying to tell Count Donut

52:41.960 --> 52:42.800
things about himself.

52:42.800 --> 52:44.680
I at some point forgot how to read

52:44.680 --> 52:46.840
and I've never thought to relearn.

52:46.840 --> 52:49.200
I have no cause for knowledge.

52:49.200 --> 52:50.040
You don't need that.

52:50.040 --> 52:51.760
I thirst only for blood.

52:51.760 --> 52:52.600
And Donut.

52:52.600 --> 52:54.520
Have you seen a frog?

52:54.520 --> 52:55.360
What?

52:55.360 --> 52:57.440
Sometimes I see a frog.

52:57.440 --> 52:59.800
And other times I have never seen a frog.

52:59.800 --> 53:01.120
But you know what a frog, you know what a frog.

53:01.120 --> 53:02.280
I see them sometimes,

53:02.280 --> 53:06.200
but it seems like there are more that I'm registering.

53:06.200 --> 53:07.520
Hey, Count Donut, just so you know,

53:07.520 --> 53:09.440
that's the universal experience.

53:09.440 --> 53:12.280
There's not a human being on Earth that's seen every frog.

53:12.280 --> 53:14.720
Well, I suspect sometimes they're in water.

53:14.720 --> 53:16.840
So I would have no awareness of that.

53:16.840 --> 53:20.280
Okay, so now we're dealing with a sort of object permanence

53:20.280 --> 53:22.200
when something goes in water.

53:22.200 --> 53:23.760
It's a cruel trick of fate.

53:23.760 --> 53:28.480
I am permanent while the world around me spins chaotically

53:28.480 --> 53:29.320
and continues to evolve.

53:29.320 --> 53:31.000
Well, no, when the frog goes in the water,

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
it's definitely still there.

53:33.000 --> 53:34.360
It's still there.

53:34.360 --> 53:36.080
Also the Earth rotation is pretty sad.

53:36.080 --> 53:37.320
Hold on, Travis, hold on, Travis.

53:37.320 --> 53:39.200
Don't just say yes.

53:39.200 --> 53:42.840
People feel bad for me

53:42.840 --> 53:45.000
when I have not been on the show for a while,

53:45.000 --> 53:47.920
but truly they should feel bad for you

53:47.920 --> 53:50.600
because this is the one moment you exist

53:50.600 --> 53:52.280
when I am perceiving you.

53:52.280 --> 53:53.600
Oh, I see, oh no.

53:53.600 --> 53:54.520
Whoa.

53:54.520 --> 53:55.680
Right.

53:55.680 --> 53:57.120
Count Donut, what a skewed view.

53:57.120 --> 53:58.320
One thing about me.

53:59.400 --> 54:01.120
Hold on, I'm thinking, yes.

54:01.120 --> 54:04.400
One thing about me is I lack object permanence.

54:04.400 --> 54:07.560
So you do not exist to me when I'm not directly

54:07.560 --> 54:08.960
looking at you.

54:08.960 --> 54:10.480
It's cool that you're aware of that.

54:10.480 --> 54:13.880
Like that's a huge, that's a power in and of itself.

54:13.880 --> 54:17.960
Yes, my wife Drew Barrymore reminds me every morning

54:17.960 --> 54:18.800
when I awaken.

54:18.800 --> 54:20.440
Whoa, wait, what?

54:20.440 --> 54:23.640
Yes, I live on a boat with Drew Barrymore.

54:23.640 --> 54:27.560
So when you say you walk this Earth, try and go there.

54:27.560 --> 54:31.120
Well, I walk onto the pier and then I walk the Earth, yes.

54:31.120 --> 54:32.720
Okay, but every night.

54:32.720 --> 54:34.880
And then you go back to your boat home.

54:34.880 --> 54:37.080
Your boat home, which is about as close to living

54:37.080 --> 54:39.520
in the water as you can get without living in the water.

54:39.520 --> 54:41.320
You've never even looked over the side of your boat home

54:41.320 --> 54:42.880
and seen a fish.

54:42.880 --> 54:45.080
You've never been like, what's that in there?

54:46.080 --> 54:48.760
I thought it was part of the water.

54:48.760 --> 54:51.160
Have you been to Red Lobster?

54:51.960 --> 54:54.720
Red Lobster, I like the red part.

54:54.720 --> 54:56.160
I feel like if I ate crates-

54:56.160 --> 55:00.280
No, come on, this is a land-based restaurant business.

55:00.280 --> 55:02.360
And I know Drew Barrymore goes there.

55:02.360 --> 55:04.200
I know she's, I've seen her at Red Lobster.

55:04.200 --> 55:05.440
Even if you're not eating there,

55:05.440 --> 55:08.160
you would take her because you love her.

55:08.160 --> 55:10.240
Yes, I have, fine, yes.

55:10.240 --> 55:12.240
We can do this, like this if you like.

55:12.240 --> 55:13.080
I have been to Red Lobster.

55:13.080 --> 55:14.120
I do wanna do this.

55:14.120 --> 55:15.960
I have been to Red Lobster.

55:15.960 --> 55:17.360
So have you looked at the menu?

55:17.360 --> 55:19.080
Highly craveable.

55:19.080 --> 55:21.120
Yeah, great, cheddar bay biscuits, we love those.

55:21.120 --> 55:21.960
But like, if you look at the menu-

55:21.960 --> 55:25.560
I am the one who must open the shrimp vortex every year.

55:25.560 --> 55:26.960
They're named English shrimp.

55:26.960 --> 55:28.400
Okay, see, no, that's shrimp.

55:28.400 --> 55:29.240
You just said shrimp.

55:29.240 --> 55:31.680
I just slit my, well, I create.

55:31.680 --> 55:34.800
Yes, they're crispy and broiled shrimp.

55:34.800 --> 55:37.960
The amazing miracle food that comes from the vortex.

55:37.960 --> 55:39.680
Every year during Endless Shrimp,

55:39.680 --> 55:41.120
I must slice open my palm

55:41.120 --> 55:43.440
and let three drops of my blood fall onto the tablet.

55:43.440 --> 55:44.280
Yeah, we know.

55:44.280 --> 55:46.800
And then the Endless Shrimp vortex can open.

55:46.800 --> 55:47.640
It's a merit-

55:47.640 --> 55:49.320
It says it on every menu.

55:49.320 --> 55:50.880
Skip this. We know.

55:50.880 --> 55:52.880
Yeah, skip dialogue, next, we know.

55:52.880 --> 55:55.800
Okay, so the miracle is that this food,

55:55.800 --> 55:57.800
this miraculous food of shrimp,

55:57.800 --> 56:00.520
comes from the vortex, completely prepared.

56:00.520 --> 56:01.360
No.

56:01.360 --> 56:03.120
No discernible source.

56:03.120 --> 56:03.960
No.

56:03.960 --> 56:04.800
No, no, no.

56:04.800 --> 56:07.800
Shrimp lives in water for the most part.

56:08.880 --> 56:13.160
And so they are a type of fish, technically speaking.

56:13.160 --> 56:14.000
They don't look-

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
I don't want you to look at a shrimp and be like,

56:16.000 --> 56:17.040
that's what a fish looks like.

56:17.040 --> 56:20.560
Because honestly, I would say they are kind of the exception

56:20.560 --> 56:22.360
to the rule.

56:22.360 --> 56:23.400
Most shrimps aren't,

56:23.400 --> 56:25.840
most fish aren't like sort of curvy like that.

56:26.880 --> 56:27.720
Travis?

56:27.720 --> 56:28.880
Yeah?

56:28.880 --> 56:30.800
Oh, you're Travis Griffin.

56:30.800 --> 56:31.640
Yeah.

56:31.640 --> 56:32.800
Oh, are you telling me,

56:34.440 --> 56:36.280
are you telling me they have souls?

56:38.440 --> 56:41.600
If they have souls, then I am surely damned.

56:41.600 --> 56:43.640
There is no god on any plane

56:43.640 --> 56:46.040
that would forgive the number of shrimp

56:46.040 --> 56:47.880
that I have summoned from the vortex

56:47.880 --> 56:49.280
if they possess souls.

56:49.280 --> 56:52.080
Let me comfort you there, Count Donut.

56:52.080 --> 56:53.160
There is no-

56:53.160 --> 56:55.840
There's no fucking way shrimps got souls.

56:55.840 --> 56:56.680
Yeah, there's no way.

56:56.680 --> 56:59.360
They barely, you know,

56:59.360 --> 57:02.080
they're like, the fact that they move

57:02.080 --> 57:06.000
is all that separates them from like a carrot, you know?

57:06.000 --> 57:07.960
You're telling me shrimp don't have souls?

57:07.960 --> 57:08.800
No way.

57:08.800 --> 57:11.760
Then how do they reach shrimp heaven?

57:12.680 --> 57:13.720
Thanks, everybody.

57:13.720 --> 57:15.960
I really appreciate you listening to our podcast.

57:15.960 --> 57:16.800
What?

57:16.800 --> 57:17.640
Whoa, Chad.

57:17.640 --> 57:19.640
My brother and me, it was all building to this.

57:19.640 --> 57:23.120
The prestige is that I turned down my hood

57:23.120 --> 57:25.600
and transformed back into your brother, Justin.

57:25.600 --> 57:27.800
And I hope you had a really instructive time.

57:27.800 --> 57:31.920
Make the mouth hole donut go the fuck away, please.

57:31.920 --> 57:33.080
Oh, I'm so sorry.

57:33.080 --> 57:33.920
I'm so sorry.

57:33.920 --> 57:35.320
It is, there is something about the placement of the eyes

57:35.320 --> 57:37.320
that did make that look like it was screaming, right?

57:37.320 --> 57:38.160
Yeah.

57:38.160 --> 57:39.240
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

57:39.240 --> 57:40.400
What if you don't take the teeth out?

57:40.400 --> 57:41.720
That seems like a big risk, actually.

57:41.720 --> 57:43.880
Anyway, thanks so much for listening to our podcast,

57:43.880 --> 57:45.280
my brother, my brother, and me.

57:45.280 --> 57:46.120
We hope you're ha-

57:46.120 --> 57:48.080
I hope Travis is having a good time.

57:48.080 --> 57:48.920
Oh, I'm sure I am.

57:48.920 --> 57:50.120
I'm in a castle.

57:50.120 --> 57:52.040
That's my natural habitat.

57:52.040 --> 57:56.880
And I hope that you will come see our shows

57:56.880 --> 57:58.120
if you would like to do that.

57:58.120 --> 57:59.680
Travis, please help.

57:59.680 --> 58:02.240
Yes, so we have rescheduled dates

58:02.240 --> 58:04.080
for our San Jose and Denver shows,

58:04.080 --> 58:06.000
which we're very excited about.

58:06.000 --> 58:09.080

58:09.080 --> 58:11.960
Adventure Zone with Aabria Iyengar.

58:11.960 --> 58:14.560
Then we have San Jose, My Brother, My Brother, and Me

58:14.560 --> 58:15.880
on April 28th.

58:15.880 --> 58:19.240
My Brother, My Brother, and Me in Denver on April 29th.

58:19.240 --> 58:20.440
So get those tickets.

58:20.440 --> 58:21.560
And if you already have them,

58:21.560 --> 58:23.680
all existing tickets for rescheduled shows

58:23.680 --> 58:25.240
will be honored for the new dates.

58:25.240 --> 58:27.640
Refunds for those unable to attend the new dates

58:27.640 --> 58:30.160
will be available at point of purchase.

58:30.160 --> 58:33.280
So you can go get those tickets soon

58:33.280 --> 58:36.000
to if you want to come to the April shows.

58:36.000 --> 58:38.760
And if you already have, you can just hold on to them.

58:38.760 --> 58:39.600
Sound good?

58:39.600 --> 58:40.960
Great. That's great.

58:40.960 --> 58:42.520
Also, don't forget in November,

58:42.520 --> 58:46.280
we've got shows coming up in Cincinnati, Detroit,

58:46.280 --> 58:47.760
and Washington, DC,

58:47.760 --> 58:51.080
including a Adventure Zone in Washington, DC

58:51.080 --> 58:55.520
with guest DM Brennan Lee Mulligan playing Dadlands 2.0.

58:55.520 --> 58:58.960
Go check out all the great merch over at McElroyMerch.com.

59:00.760 --> 59:03.240
That's all I can think of off the top of my head.

59:03.240 --> 59:04.840
Thank you to Montaigne for the use of our theme song,

59:04.840 --> 59:06.960
My Life Is Better With You.

59:06.960 --> 59:09.440
Montaigne, they are currently on tour now.

59:09.440 --> 59:13.920
Shredding Australia saw a clip of Montaigne

59:13.920 --> 59:16.480
playing our theme song on a stage

59:16.480 --> 59:17.600
and people bouncing to it.

59:17.600 --> 59:18.920
It was very life affirming.

59:18.920 --> 59:21.520
So thank you, thank you for that.

59:21.520 --> 59:24.440
And thanks to Maximum Fun for having us on the network.

59:24.440 --> 59:25.520
It's a good time.

59:25.520 --> 59:26.640
We're having a great time over here.

59:26.640 --> 59:28.320
And then that's it for the show.

59:28.320 --> 59:29.160
All right.

59:29.160 --> 59:30.200
Happy Halloween.

59:30.200 --> 59:31.040
Yeah, happy Halloween.

59:31.040 --> 59:32.880
I don't even think my Halloween present to you

59:32.880 --> 59:35.920
is that I'm gonna let you have the final bit

59:35.920 --> 59:37.600
and you just kind of say like an inspirational,

59:37.600 --> 59:40.480
but in this case, it could also be like spooky,

59:40.480 --> 59:42.320
not scary, but spooky.

59:42.320 --> 59:43.160
Okay.

59:45.000 --> 59:46.000
Okay, here it comes.

59:46.000 --> 59:49.200
So, when light,

59:51.880 --> 59:56.880
I had to gin up a whole mummy's maze

59:58.480 --> 01:00:00.920
Whoa, that wasn't prepared?

01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:03.120
No, of course it wasn't fucking prepared, Travis.

01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:04.120
Did you not hear that?

01:00:04.120 --> 01:00:06.120
Sometimes I use this like tone of voice

01:00:06.120 --> 01:00:11.120
that's like, kind of like he's doing his not smart voice.

01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:14.800
And that's me like, just sort of trying to buy myself time.

01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:19.800
But, and now you guys are having me do an additional thing

01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:22.120
at the end of the episode on top of the mummy's maze.

01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:25.360
That was like 10 minutes of good content.

01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:26.400
So when you guys do this to me,

01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:28.320
you're basically saying like, hey Griffin,

01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:30.840
we know that you've been doing most of the content

01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:32.160
this episode.

01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:36.600
Justin, hey Justin was Count Donut for like 25 minutes.

01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:40.320
That was good, but I feel like we helped you.

01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:42.400
I feel like we helped with Count Donut.

01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:44.080
Okay, I want to actually suggest this.

01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:46.280
Oh yeah, go ahead.

01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:49.680
We should do an impromptu who did the least.

01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:50.640
Oh, okay.

01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:51.680
At the end of each episode,

01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:53.240
we should actually, instead of put it on Griffin every time,

01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:54.600
just decide who did the least.

01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:55.440
Who did the least.

01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:56.560
Well, for my own personal reasons,

01:00:56.560 --> 01:00:57.480
which I don't need to go into,

01:00:57.480 --> 01:00:59.000
I'm not wild about that idea.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.880
It's not important why.

01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:06.880
Okay, I will close it out this time

01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:11.880
and just say that you can always go trick or treat,

01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:15.600
no matter how old you are,

01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:17.040
if you got a costume.

01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:19.120
If the people are home or not.

01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:21.680
No, you should, but do it all by rules and laws,

01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:24.080
but you can always trick or treat.

01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:26.680
How successful it will be, I don't know.

01:01:26.680 --> 01:01:27.840
But you can always do it,

01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:30.800
unless it's like a gated community where the HOA is like,

01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:32.520
please, come on, can we not?

01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:34.640
But that's my inspirational thing.

01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:36.280
You can always trick or treat.

01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:38.240
Okay, it's more of an observation.

01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:39.560
My name is Justin McElroy.

01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:40.520
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:41.360
I'm Griffin McElroy.

01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:42.640
This has been my brother, my brother, me,

01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:44.760
kiss your dad, square on the lips.

01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:49.760
It's better with you, my life, oh, it's better,

01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:59.280
it's better with you, my life, oh, it's better,

01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:05.280
it's better, it's better with you, this is true, oh, it's better,

01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:29.280
it's better, it's better with you, my life, oh, it's better with you.
