WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:28.000
It's familiar, but not too familiar, but not too not familiar.

00:28.000 --> 00:53.900
My son is at Santa for a Wii U. Is it Santa or Santa? My son is at Santa for a Wii U this year.

00:53.900 --> 00:57.000
My wife and I have absolutely no intention of buying a Wii U for a

00:57.000 --> 01:00.160
variety of reasons. He's young enough that we don't want to tell him the truth

01:00.160 --> 01:04.160
about Santa yet, but we don't want to be disappointed when the big day comes.

01:04.160 --> 01:08.440
We've tried several ways of talking him out of this Wii U idea, but his

01:08.440 --> 01:13.040
conviction is pretty strong. How can we shake him of the idea that Santa will

01:13.040 --> 01:16.480
bring him this ridiculous gift without ruining the magic? That's from Alex.

01:16.480 --> 01:20.040
Why is your kid asking for presents from Sansa from Game of Thrones? I don't

01:20.040 --> 01:27.320
understand. I thought it was Beyonce's alter ego, Santa Fears. Sure. Listen, let me

01:27.320 --> 01:32.680
let me talk to your kid. You guys have to leave the room. Come in here little

01:32.680 --> 01:38.360
Bryce. Come in here little Bryce. Let the brothers back right talk to you. Now parents you do

01:38.360 --> 01:41.760
have to leave the room. We probably, you know we can't use bad words. We've been

01:41.760 --> 01:47.900
bound by a blood oath, so just leave the room and let us talk to him. You know

01:47.900 --> 01:55.520
Santa's gonna bring it to you. Yeah. Mom and dad are playing this, playing dumb

01:55.520 --> 02:00.040
basically. They're trying to be so cool. You know my parents try to play this

02:00.040 --> 02:05.000
game. Oh what a Guinness. I'm not gonna get you one of those. And then what's

02:05.000 --> 02:12.220
that? Nintendo 64. Wouldn't you like settle for a Nintendo 63? And then what's that behind the

02:12.220 --> 02:17.000
couch? Oh must be from Santa. What's that from Nonny? Nonny's got you another

02:17.000 --> 02:21.680
present. What's that? It's a secret present. Wait what did Nonny get?

02:21.680 --> 02:26.680
Open it up. Oh it's a sewing machine box. Nonny wait a minute. Wait a minute.

02:26.680 --> 02:30.120
Feels like there's some extra space. Something now rattling around in this

02:30.120 --> 02:40.240
box. Open it up. Is it closed? There's a map. There's a map on this sweater. Is

02:40.240 --> 02:58.400
that a codex? Oh my god Jesus had a son. I'm not even worried about the Wii U anymore. Now I'm off on an international intrigue. I love this. I've gotta go find the Pope and kill him while he sleeps. I did not

02:58.400 --> 03:08.240
rig the da Vinci thing. That's basically it. Bryce listen. Bryce you know Santa's gonna bring it to you. Yeah if you believe. Your parents are just playing

03:08.240 --> 03:13.560
dumb. Santa always hooks you up. Bryce for real have you been good? That's the only

03:13.560 --> 03:17.480
question because if it doesn't show up then you know that somewhere along the

03:17.480 --> 03:20.560
line you done goofed up somewhere. Bryce have you been good and are you a

03:20.560 --> 03:25.200
Christian? Have you heard the good news? Bryce we've got good news. Wear this cape.

03:25.200 --> 03:30.480
Wear this cape. Take this little book. Don't tell your parents though. Bryce we've got good news about the love of Christ.

03:30.480 --> 03:53.520
Keep this little book secret Bryce. But if Santa doesn't bring you a Wii U then Jesus definitely is. Jesus is Wii U insurance Bryce. If Santa doesn't bring you a Wii U it's because your parents don't believe in

03:53.520 --> 03:58.800
Jesus. You gotta diversify. Diversify your Wii U portfolio. Listen playing Wii U is

03:58.800 --> 04:17.160
cool. You know what is cool? Living forever. Don't you want to live forever Bryce? And also possibly playing two Wii U's. One from Santa one from Jesus. After you hear this good news you're gonna be like we who? Because of the good news. Nintendo power? No power of prayer. Power of prayer. Maybe the real power isn't Nintendo

04:17.160 --> 04:21.680
power after all. And also Nintendo power of prayer. Hey Bryce Jesus does what

04:21.680 --> 04:43.560
Nintendo don't. Just food for thought Bryce. Chew it over. Maul it over. Parents you can come back. It's all sorted. We smoothed it all out. Hey listen do get my cape back from him though. That wasn't for Keebz. That wasn't Keebz that was like a

04:43.560 --> 05:13.520
load of cake. He's crying because he saw something outside the window that scared him. It was a hawk. A big hawk flew down. We scared it away. We freaked it out though. God once you have one year where Santa doesn't bring the kid what he wants you never have to worry about bad behavior again. Do you want this to be like the one year? The one year that Santa really followed through on his seemingly hollow threat to not bring you what you wanted?

05:13.520 --> 05:41.480
Just Merry Christmas. Bryce's parents. It's going to be a great one. It's going to be a great one. Don't listen back to that part. You're going to be tempted. Just burn this after it's done. Your iPhone I mean. Bryce just flush it. Just flush this phone down the potty Bryce. Daddy doesn't need it. That way Santa can find it. Because he lives in the sewers. No I'm thinking of it. I'm sorry.

05:41.480 --> 06:07.480
One of those three is definitely going to hook you up with the Wii U. Jesus, Santa, or it. Pennywise is going to bring you a Wii U. This is important Bryce. Don't go to him. Let him come to you with the Wii U. Don't. He's going to come at you from the sewer like check it out. Tell him to slide it to you. I'm down here having a fun fun two screen experience with Mario and Yoshi. Come check it out. And you say no Pennywise why don't you come up. I got a big table up here.

06:07.480 --> 06:36.480
Why don't you come up here Pennywise. They all waggle down here Brycey. I've got a lot of space that you can really explore with that gamepad. You're going to. I'm telling you I think it's going to be way better up here. So why don't you just. Just not in the sewer if we could. Hey, I know kids love clowns. Is there a clown in the world that can entice a child to follow into a sewer? How good is this clown?

06:36.480 --> 06:43.480
He was just so gosh darn charming. He is. No he's not. He's Tim Curry.

06:43.480 --> 06:59.480
And Tim Curry as we know is not blessed with natural charm. Could Tim Curry entice any child into any space anywhere on the earth above ground or subterranean for any reason using any means imaginable?

06:59.480 --> 07:13.480
He can have all the Wii U's and candy in the world and be standing 10 feet away from the child in an open space. I'm going to make you a deal. Surrounded by Wii U, the candy, the pony, and the balloons. Right.

07:13.480 --> 07:20.480
Tim Curry couldn't entice a child into an ice cream truck driven by a Pokemon.

07:20.480 --> 07:31.480
He could be surrounded by his parents and police officers. Come here. You're going to love this. I'm chilling in here with Pikachu and Charmander.

07:31.480 --> 07:40.480
Charizard, pump the brakes. We're all eating push pops.

07:40.480 --> 07:55.480
How do I see you met my faithful ghastly? Don't get strung out by the way I look. Well, what else do I have to go on right now? You are a clown with sharp teeth.

07:55.480 --> 08:02.480
I would rather not. Do get strung out. Very strung out. To be fair, I also don't think Tim Curry could encourage an adult to do anything.

08:02.480 --> 08:12.480
Well, except dance. But let's let's get back to Snuggies because I feel like we've made Justin uncomfortable.

08:12.480 --> 08:18.480
I think Justin's left. I think Justin might have switched the nozzle. He might have flipped the flanger.

08:18.480 --> 08:30.480
I'm still here. What happened? My cat took a dump in here and I'm dying.

08:30.480 --> 08:38.480
I'm trying to like listen to this goop and pick back up on the goop. I'm trying to also light a sensei.

08:38.480 --> 08:50.480
This is important. Is it the cat that you have that is approximately three apples long or is it the 600 pound sea cow with furry legs?

08:50.480 --> 08:54.480
I'm going to say it's the skinny one because they got it. It was like a stealth mish.

08:54.480 --> 09:04.480
They got in and out and I didn't I didn't get them until I started getting in my old factories. Oh God, it's so dirty in here.

09:04.480 --> 09:14.480
I have to find a candle. Say something funny. I sprayed some Old Spice Fiji body spray.

09:14.480 --> 09:24.480
It's getting a little better. Oh no, it's getting worse. They're blending. Stop doing aerosol alchemy.

09:24.480 --> 09:32.480
Can you not? It smells like physical therapist and cat food in here and I hate it.

09:32.480 --> 09:37.480
It's like Jim, bro. Let's do the next question. Okay. Oh, I got a question.

09:37.480 --> 09:40.480
How do you get the cat poopy smell out of your office when you try to do comedy?

09:40.480 --> 09:44.480
This is a really good idea. The room in your house that you work out of and spend most of your time.

09:44.480 --> 09:50.480
Don't let your animals shit in it. Maybe don't put a shit receptacle for any living being in it.

09:50.480 --> 09:53.480
You have full control over where that shit occurs.

09:53.480 --> 09:58.480
It all started because I had to keep the little one locked in here to keep her separate from the big one.

09:58.480 --> 10:05.480
So I would put the dookie box in here and then I realized I should move it out of here because I'm in here.

10:05.480 --> 10:11.480
But then I'm so worried that Amelia will be like, well, I've always stayed here before.

10:11.480 --> 10:17.480
Sorry you didn't have that magic dirt. I'm a cat.

10:17.480 --> 10:26.480
As I'm passing those people, it is almost certainly the only time I'm ever going to see them.

10:26.480 --> 10:28.480
It is intoxicating, right?

10:28.480 --> 10:35.480
The way I think about it is that as soon as I avert my eyes from those people, they're dead.

10:35.480 --> 10:39.480
That's actually how I operate in just everyday life.

10:39.480 --> 10:44.480
When I don't see my friends, they're dead. Whenever I'm not talking to you guys, you're dead.

10:44.480 --> 10:48.480
My world only exists within a six foot circle around me.

10:48.480 --> 10:55.480
So when babies start to figure out spatial understanding, you just skip that one.

10:55.480 --> 11:00.480
We tried to play peekaboo with Travis and he just screams. He just screams wildly.

11:00.480 --> 11:03.480
Where are you? What the fuck? Justin!

11:03.480 --> 11:06.480
There was a man. There was a man named Clint.

11:06.480 --> 11:09.480
This sounds like a pretty good Liam Neeson movie.

11:09.480 --> 11:10.480
Exactly.

11:10.480 --> 11:12.480
Where did you go?

11:12.480 --> 11:15.480
It's taken three and he's playing peekaboo with his daughter.

11:15.480 --> 11:17.480
Return my daughter to me!

11:17.480 --> 11:20.480
I'm just behind this washcloth, Dad.

11:20.480 --> 11:23.480
Dad, I'm behind a washcloth.

11:23.480 --> 11:25.480
I have a particular set of skills.

11:25.480 --> 11:31.480
I'm upstairs. You hear the vacuum cleaner. I'm upstairs.

11:31.480 --> 11:34.480
Please fix your object permanence.

11:34.480 --> 11:40.480
I have a particular set of skills. Object permanence is not one of them.

11:40.480 --> 11:43.480
But I have learned all my shapes.

11:43.480 --> 11:48.480
Let me draw you a circle.

11:48.480 --> 11:52.480
Ten. I have ten fingers, ten toes.

11:52.480 --> 11:55.480
This is like a Muppet Babies version of Taken.

11:55.480 --> 11:57.480
Taken Babies.

11:57.480 --> 11:59.480
Oh, God.

11:59.480 --> 12:01.480
I make pee pee in the potty.

12:01.480 --> 12:05.480
Who's the big boy? You're about to find out.

12:05.480 --> 12:08.480
If you don't return my daughter. Dad, I'm right here!

12:08.480 --> 12:10.480
Just turn around slightly to the side.

12:10.480 --> 12:13.480
You swear you wouldn't do this at my wedding.

12:13.480 --> 12:17.480
I'll lift the veil. Is that what you want? I'll lift it.

12:17.480 --> 12:18.480
Fuck!

12:18.480 --> 12:24.480
Can I cut you guys with a proverb and you let me know if it seems wise to you?

12:24.480 --> 12:26.480
Because in my head right now, it seems really wise.

12:26.480 --> 12:29.480
Throw your wisdom spaghetti against our wall and we'll tell you what's next.

12:29.480 --> 12:30.480
Let me just see what it says.

12:30.480 --> 12:32.480
And then we'll say, you wasted that spaghetti. What the fuck?

12:32.480 --> 12:35.480
I'm not saying you're going to want to cross-stitch this on something.

12:35.480 --> 12:37.480
But I think there's a nugget of truth there.

12:37.480 --> 12:43.480
The man who sleeps with a machete is a fool every night but one.

12:43.480 --> 12:45.480
Think about that for a second.

12:45.480 --> 12:48.480
You know what? I am going to get that stitched onto a pillow.

12:48.480 --> 12:52.480
Or your arm or something. Just stitch it, I feel like.

12:52.480 --> 12:59.480
I don't want to get too deep here, but I would also say that every morning when you wake up, you're forced to survive.

12:59.480 --> 13:01.480
Wow. Damn it.

13:01.480 --> 13:03.480
Can I try? Can I try?

13:03.480 --> 13:04.480
Yeah.

13:04.480 --> 13:10.480
The world is a little bit brighter when you carry a smile for a flashlight. God damn it.

13:10.480 --> 13:11.480
Can I try again?

13:11.480 --> 13:14.480
Let me hit you with another one.

13:14.480 --> 13:15.480
Okay.

13:15.480 --> 13:16.480
Okay.

13:16.480 --> 13:18.480
Life is like a box of chocolate.

13:18.480 --> 13:23.480
Get out. We were doing so good. We were doing so good.

13:23.480 --> 13:24.480
Wait. Okay. How about this one?

13:24.480 --> 13:25.480
Okay.

13:25.480 --> 13:30.480
The man who sleeps with a machete is a cut above the rest.

13:30.480 --> 13:32.480
That wasn't a proverb. It's like a pun.

13:32.480 --> 13:33.480
I think it was.

13:33.480 --> 13:41.480
That sounds like the sign you put outside of your machete store.

13:41.480 --> 13:47.480
Well, okay. To be fair, my machete store, a cut above, is thriving. Thank you very much.

13:47.480 --> 13:51.480
It leads me to a question I've always wondered, which is, if you got someone strong enough,

13:51.480 --> 13:59.480
and they, whilst hugging someone, grab both of their buttcheeks and pull the part really hard, could you rip someone in half?

13:59.480 --> 14:05.480
Because I feel like the butt crack is like that little slit that they make in packages that allow you to open it easily.

14:05.480 --> 14:08.480
And it's like God's way of saying, rip this person in two.

14:08.480 --> 14:11.480
It's your Achilles heel, except it's your asshole.

14:11.480 --> 14:13.480
Have you never wondered that, you guys?

14:13.480 --> 14:15.480
You've never wondered that? Come on.

14:15.480 --> 14:18.480
Why God perforated us? Is he daring?

14:18.480 --> 14:23.480
You're saying that if you were to tear a human being in half long ways,

14:23.480 --> 14:28.480
that the best place to start would be the buttcheeks because it's natural handles, and also there's already-

14:28.480 --> 14:31.480
Obviously. I mean, that's a given. That's not my question.

14:31.480 --> 14:36.480
My question is, I don't know if anyone's ever tried it before, but would it be a clean break?

14:36.480 --> 14:38.480
Could you do it in two?

14:38.480 --> 14:42.480
I don't think that anyone- I don't even think Hulk Hogan and his prime could do that.

14:42.480 --> 14:47.480
Maybe the power team could. Maybe the blessing of God's will.

14:47.480 --> 14:52.480
I just thought about it, and I watched the Hulk Hogan sex tape, and he actually did do that. I take it back.

14:52.480 --> 14:57.480
Brother, are you ready for my special move, brother?

14:57.480 --> 14:59.480
Here it comes.

14:59.480 --> 15:02.480
I'd rather not!

15:02.480 --> 15:09.480
Hulkamania is about to run wild all over your butt and your vagina.

15:09.480 --> 15:12.480
I'm gonna tear your butt and vagina in half, brother.

15:12.480 --> 15:16.480
Then there was a 48-hour manhunt.

15:16.480 --> 15:20.480
Only one man could leave tracks like this.

15:20.480 --> 15:24.480
It's just Hulk Hogan running naked through the woods.

15:24.480 --> 15:28.480
Somebody call Tommy Lee Jones!

15:28.480 --> 15:32.480
I didn't destroy that butt, Hulk Hogan, sir.

15:32.480 --> 15:34.480
I'm pretty sure you did.

15:34.480 --> 15:36.480
We actually have a sex tape of you doing it.

15:36.480 --> 15:39.480
I'm Hulk Hogan destroying this butt.

15:39.480 --> 15:42.480
You have butt blood all over your hands.

15:42.480 --> 15:46.480
Sir, Andre the Giant is dead. There's nobody else.

15:46.480 --> 15:51.480
Have you guys seen that Hulk Hogan Andre the Giant sex tape?

15:51.480 --> 15:54.480
Oh my God.

15:54.480 --> 15:59.480
Both of them in a test for dominance trying to tear the other one's butt.

15:59.480 --> 16:03.480
It's like the opening scene in Melancholia where the two planets collide.

16:03.480 --> 16:05.480
That's basically what we're talking about.

16:05.480 --> 16:08.480
It's like the last scene in Over the Top.

16:08.480 --> 16:16.480
Except it's under the bottom.

16:16.480 --> 16:17.480
Oh man.

16:17.480 --> 16:18.480
Can we be done?

16:18.480 --> 16:21.480
Hulk Hogan, it feels so good.

16:21.480 --> 16:31.480
I didn't think I would like the way it feels inside, but I do in fact like the way it feels.

16:31.480 --> 16:35.480
I'm gonna call me new Hulk Hogan!

16:35.480 --> 16:38.480
What the hell is that impression?

16:38.480 --> 16:42.480
That's what Andre the Giant sounds like mid-coitus, of course.

16:42.480 --> 16:46.480
Because it sounds like the baby of Andre the Giant Sylvester Stallone.

16:46.480 --> 16:51.480
If you tear my butt in half, then I do not think I will laugh.

16:51.480 --> 16:55.480
Anybody want a penis?

16:55.480 --> 17:00.480
Hulk Hogan, perhaps you?

17:00.480 --> 17:02.480
Should we make a bet?

17:02.480 --> 17:10.480
I have four gallons of what in my room?

17:10.480 --> 17:15.480
I have a bag of 30 hamburgers.

17:15.480 --> 17:23.480
I have that giant armchair Gallagher used to use.

17:23.480 --> 17:29.480
I have a bicycle built for two.

17:29.480 --> 17:31.480
It is just mine.

17:31.480 --> 17:35.480
I'm gonna snap into some butt cheeks.

17:35.480 --> 17:36.480
What are you doing?

17:36.480 --> 17:37.480
Get out of here.

17:37.480 --> 17:39.480
Randy, watch me.

17:39.480 --> 17:40.480
Nobody wants you here.

17:40.480 --> 17:41.480
Nobody wants to tear your butt in half.

17:41.480 --> 17:42.480
We're getting tender.

17:42.480 --> 17:43.480
Get out of here.

17:43.480 --> 17:46.480
Oh yeah, I have a lance.

17:46.480 --> 17:47.480
Tear my butt in half.

17:47.480 --> 17:48.480
Get out of here, Randy.

17:48.480 --> 17:49.480
Please.

17:49.480 --> 17:50.480
Randy, please.

17:50.480 --> 17:51.480
Unless.

17:51.480 --> 17:52.480
Unless.

17:52.480 --> 17:59.480
She's trying to set you up as like, can't fuck this.

17:59.480 --> 18:00.480
You know what I mean?

18:00.480 --> 18:03.480
Oh, she's putting her on a pedestal preemptively.

18:03.480 --> 18:06.480
This is what I'm saying.

18:06.480 --> 18:10.480
It's not what I'm saying though, because it's the dumbest.

18:10.480 --> 18:11.480
No, say it.

18:11.480 --> 18:12.480
Get it out there.

18:12.480 --> 18:19.480
If you say that this person doesn't have sexual, then the person, if the person is the right

18:19.480 --> 18:25.480
kind of person, or by which I mean the wrongest person ever, they might say, well, I can get

18:25.480 --> 18:26.480
some sexual in there.

18:26.480 --> 18:27.480
I bet.

18:27.480 --> 18:28.480
Let me see.

18:28.480 --> 18:29.480
I bet I can.

18:29.480 --> 18:30.480
Let me.

18:30.480 --> 18:31.480
You haven't seen what I do in there.

18:31.480 --> 18:32.480
Let me find out.

18:32.480 --> 18:33.480
Up and around it.

18:33.480 --> 18:34.480
Let me find out.

18:34.480 --> 18:35.480
Maybe you're just Dansexual.

18:35.480 --> 18:36.480
Hold on.

18:36.480 --> 18:40.480
Let Dan find out what's going on in there.

18:40.480 --> 18:43.480
Maybe this whole time you've been Dansexual.

18:43.480 --> 18:44.480
Might I suggest Dan?

18:44.480 --> 18:46.480
Hey, don't be Danphobic.

18:46.480 --> 18:47.480
This is...

18:47.480 --> 18:51.480
Let me break you off some Dan.

18:51.480 --> 18:52.480
Just real quick.

18:52.480 --> 18:55.480
Just the taste of the flavor.

18:55.480 --> 18:56.480
You know what they say.

18:56.480 --> 19:03.480
Once you go Dan, hey, did you try the flan?

19:03.480 --> 19:06.480
Because Dan makes flan for you after he makes love to you.

19:06.480 --> 19:07.480
Dan's the flan man.

19:07.480 --> 19:08.480
Don't even worry about it.

19:08.480 --> 19:11.480
That's basically Dan's calling card.

19:11.480 --> 19:14.480
If you smell flan, you know Dan's been fucking.

19:14.480 --> 19:16.480
Do you want to fuck Dan and eat some flan?

19:16.480 --> 19:17.480
Oh, what's that?

19:17.480 --> 19:18.480
You don't like flan?

19:18.480 --> 19:19.480
I understand.

19:19.480 --> 19:23.480
The weirdest Dr. Seuss book ever.

19:23.480 --> 19:26.480
Dan the man with the flan plan.

19:26.480 --> 19:29.480
Fucking.

19:29.480 --> 19:31.480
Dan's about two things.

19:31.480 --> 19:33.480
Fucking and eating flan.

19:33.480 --> 19:34.480
On his deathbed.

19:34.480 --> 19:35.480
And we're all out of flan.

19:35.480 --> 19:39.480
On his deathbed, Dr. Seuss handed that book to his publisher.

19:39.480 --> 19:44.480
Dr. Seuss is like, listen, I know I told you that I didn't have any more books.

19:44.480 --> 19:47.480
I said I was out the game, but wait till you hear my new shit.

19:47.480 --> 19:53.480
I know I've been battling with mild dementia, but I believe this is my magnum opus.

19:53.480 --> 19:54.480
That bitch is fine.

19:54.480 --> 19:56.480
Let me know what you think.

19:56.480 --> 19:58.480
It's like that scene in Proof.

19:58.480 --> 20:00.480
It's from the notebook.

20:00.480 --> 20:03.480
This is just pictures of a guy fucking some flan.

20:03.480 --> 20:06.480
He had so many characters, Dan the flan fucking man.

20:06.480 --> 20:07.480
What do you think?

20:07.480 --> 20:09.480
What do you think, Seuss Incorporated?

20:09.480 --> 20:11.480
Can I get another hit?

20:11.480 --> 20:12.480
No.

20:12.480 --> 20:15.480
We are already building the ride at Universal.

20:15.480 --> 20:23.480
We're gonna have to edit this more than the original story for Hop on Pop.

20:23.480 --> 20:24.480
You're on fire today.

20:24.480 --> 20:25.480
I know.

20:25.480 --> 20:26.480
Absolutely.

20:26.480 --> 20:31.480
Just keep passing him the rock.

20:31.480 --> 20:33.480
I think the in memoriam was kind of lame this year.

20:33.480 --> 20:35.480
You guys think so?

20:35.480 --> 20:36.480
I don't know who died.

20:36.480 --> 20:38.480
Not a lot of like good people died.

20:38.480 --> 20:39.480
A lot of beast rangers.

20:39.480 --> 20:40.480
A lot of beast rangers.

20:40.480 --> 20:42.480
A lot of cinematographers.

20:42.480 --> 20:44.480
A lot of, you know.

20:44.480 --> 20:48.480
Can we all just agree to make a commitment to have more awesome people die this year?

20:48.480 --> 20:51.480
Can we get some good people to die this year?

20:51.480 --> 20:58.480
Listen, I'm not saying anything wink nudge, but I'm just saying I'd like a really blockbuster in memoriam this year.

20:58.480 --> 21:02.480
We could talk to them about adding people that haven't died yet.

21:02.480 --> 21:06.480
How fucking crazy would that be?

21:06.480 --> 21:10.480
Fucking Mickey Rourke up on the screen like in the audience.

21:10.480 --> 21:13.480
And then cut to Mickey Rourke going, what? No.

21:13.480 --> 21:14.480
No, I'm here.

21:14.480 --> 21:16.480
Can't you see me?

21:16.480 --> 21:19.480
Can't anyone see me?

21:19.480 --> 21:23.480
The whole night's about trying to convince Mickey Rourke that he's a ghost.

21:23.480 --> 21:27.480
I'd watch those Oscars.

21:27.480 --> 21:30.480
They're happening to me.

21:30.480 --> 21:35.480
And then like the only person that can see him is Bruce Willis and he just shits his pants.

21:35.480 --> 21:39.480
By the end of the night, James Cameron's like, thank you for this Oscar for Avatar 2.

21:39.480 --> 21:42.480
And he's jumping up and down behind him, waving his hands.

21:42.480 --> 21:43.480
Can't you see me?

21:43.480 --> 21:46.480
Please, someone, if you can see me, call.

21:46.480 --> 21:49.480
Call somebody.

21:49.480 --> 21:50.480
I'm not ready to go.

21:50.480 --> 21:51.480
I'm not ready to go yet.

21:51.480 --> 21:53.480
I have so much left to do.

21:53.480 --> 21:56.480
At least turn me into a snowman like in Jack Frost.

21:56.480 --> 21:59.480
I need to tell my son I love him.

21:59.480 --> 22:02.480
Like the documentary Jack Frost that I saw.

22:02.480 --> 22:06.480
Please, if anyone knows a voodoo priestess, please.

22:06.480 --> 22:11.480
I promise to be a good Jack Frost, not like the killer kind, the killer one Jack Frost movie.

22:11.480 --> 22:13.480
Snowman killer, good snowman.

22:13.480 --> 22:27.480
Hey, folks, thanks for listening to our best of episodes.

22:27.480 --> 22:31.480
It's been a few years since we've done one of these, but we weren't able to record last week.

22:31.480 --> 22:42.480
So we hope you're enjoying the golden days back when we all had the loudest air conditioners in existence.

22:42.480 --> 22:50.480
I'm guessing that air conditioner technology was not quite as advanced as it is now with our whisper quiet, you know, super coolers and stuff.

22:50.480 --> 22:52.480
But anyway, I'm not here to complain about audio quality.

22:52.480 --> 22:53.480
I am.

22:53.480 --> 22:54.480
A little bit.

22:54.480 --> 22:56.480
I'm also here to tell you about our sponsors this week.

22:56.480 --> 22:57.480
Like Away.

22:57.480 --> 23:02.480
Everything is super shitty right now, but you know what's not shitty?

23:02.480 --> 23:16.480
Away's line of rugged and powerful and sleek stylish suitcases and rollaways and bags and other jams like that.

23:16.480 --> 23:22.480
It says here, Away has asked me to speak about travel that I'm excited about in the future.

23:22.480 --> 23:28.480
To which I would reply, any travel, all travel.

23:28.480 --> 23:41.480
I have obviously not not doing a lot of flying these days, but sometimes I'll pack up my Away suitcase and carry it up the stairs and take it into the upstairs bathroom.

23:41.480 --> 23:48.480
And I don't need a lot of stuff while I'm in there, but it just feels good to do a make believe pretend voyage.

23:48.480 --> 23:58.480
But they offer a wide array of suitcases and other stuff made from a variety of different materials like polycarbonate, aluminum and durable nylon.

23:58.480 --> 24:00.480
And do they have many colors and sizes?

24:00.480 --> 24:01.480
Yes, they do.

24:01.480 --> 24:03.480
I have a big sort of gray one.

24:03.480 --> 24:06.480
I have a sort of medium sized green one.

24:06.480 --> 24:10.480
Together they they fill all my family's needs.

24:10.480 --> 24:12.480
Do they have four 360 degree spinner wheels?

24:12.480 --> 24:13.480
Yes.

24:13.480 --> 24:15.480
Do those help it roll very smoothly?

24:15.480 --> 24:16.480
Yes, of course they do.

24:16.480 --> 24:25.480
You can shop Away's selection of suitcases and bags at awaytravel.com slash my brother and give someone something to look forward to this holiday season.

24:25.480 --> 24:28.480
That's awaytravel.com slash my brother.

24:28.480 --> 24:33.480
Hey, with the holidays coming up, you know what everybody could probably use a nice pair of?

24:33.480 --> 24:34.480
Not mittens.

24:34.480 --> 24:36.480
Throw your mittens in the fucking toilet.

24:36.480 --> 24:38.480
I'm talking about Raycon earbuds.

24:38.480 --> 24:41.480
These little doodads are comfy and cozy.

24:41.480 --> 24:42.480
They plop right into your ear.

24:42.480 --> 24:44.480
They got a great sound.

24:44.480 --> 24:47.480
It's got a deep, deep, rich bassy tones.

24:47.480 --> 24:55.480
It's got anything that you could ask for to get a pleasant sort of sonorous experience.

24:55.480 --> 25:00.480
They have seamless Bluetooth pairing and a comfortable noise isolating fit.

25:00.480 --> 25:02.480
And you can start listening to them right out of the box.

25:02.480 --> 25:05.480
There's no, you know, BS setup process.

25:05.480 --> 25:08.480
You just plop them in and you can keep listening for hours.

25:08.480 --> 25:12.480
You can use them for calls or music or work or play or at home or on the go.

25:12.480 --> 25:15.480
It's the gift that keeps on giving.

25:15.480 --> 25:20.480
And it's a great gift this holiday season because it's something someone's going to use.

25:20.480 --> 25:21.480
Who wants it?

25:21.480 --> 25:24.480
Don't give them that doily.

25:24.480 --> 25:27.480
Oh, no one wants that candle.

25:27.480 --> 25:29.480
They want Raycon earbuds.

25:29.480 --> 25:35.480
And also, the best part, they're not wicked super expensive like other wireless earbuds.

25:35.480 --> 25:40.480
On top of Raycon's everyday great prices, they're offering our listeners 15% off right now.

25:40.480 --> 25:46.480
Go to buyraycon.com slash my brother today to get 15% off your Raycon order.

25:46.480 --> 25:50.480
That's buyraycon.com slash my brother.

25:50.480 --> 25:54.480
Buyraycon.com slash my brother.

25:54.480 --> 25:55.480
Enjoy the rest of the episode.

25:55.480 --> 25:56.480
Bye.

25:57.480 --> 25:58.480
Video games.

25:58.480 --> 25:59.480
Video games.

25:59.480 --> 26:01.480
Video games.

26:01.480 --> 26:02.480
You like them?

26:02.480 --> 26:03.480
Maybe you wish you had more time for them.

26:03.480 --> 26:05.480
Maybe you want to know the best ones to play.

26:05.480 --> 26:08.480
Maybe you want to know what happens to Mario when he dies.

26:08.480 --> 26:10.480
In that case, you should check out TripleClick.

26:10.480 --> 26:13.480
It's a podcast about video games.

26:13.480 --> 26:14.480
A podcast about video games?

26:14.480 --> 26:16.480
But I don't have time for that.

26:16.480 --> 26:17.480
Sure you do.

26:17.480 --> 26:20.480
Once a week, kick back as three video game experts give you everything from critical

26:20.480 --> 26:22.480
takes on the hottest new releases.

26:22.480 --> 26:25.480
To scoops, interviews, and explanations about how video games work.

26:25.480 --> 26:29.480
To fascinating and sometimes weird stories about the games we love.

26:29.480 --> 26:31.480
TripleClick is hosted by me, Kirk Hamilton.

26:31.480 --> 26:33.480
Me, Jason Schreier.

26:33.480 --> 26:34.480
And me, Maddie Myers.

26:34.480 --> 26:38.480
You can find TripleClick wherever you get your podcasts and listen at MaximumFun.org.

26:38.480 --> 26:39.480
Bye.

26:42.480 --> 26:46.480
Can we just stop it?

26:46.480 --> 26:48.480
It's really fucking silly.

26:48.480 --> 26:49.480
Like completely made up bullshit?

26:49.480 --> 26:50.480
Stop it?

26:50.480 --> 26:51.480
Is that what you mean?

26:51.480 --> 26:57.480
It really rams home the fact that time itself and our measurement of it is absolute horseshit.

26:57.480 --> 26:58.480
Not just time, right?

26:58.480 --> 26:59.480
All measurements.

26:59.480 --> 27:00.480
All measurements are made up.

27:00.480 --> 27:07.480
It's money fucking, it's a, you know, oh man, the man, right?

27:07.480 --> 27:11.480
Like business and politics and like Wall Street's not looking out for me.

27:11.480 --> 27:12.480
And my bank?

27:12.480 --> 27:14.480
No thank you.

27:14.480 --> 27:15.480
My bank.

27:15.480 --> 27:16.480
I don't want it.

27:16.480 --> 27:17.480
You know what I'm talking about?

27:17.480 --> 27:18.480
Like savings and loans.

27:18.480 --> 27:19.480
Yeah, right.

27:19.480 --> 27:20.480
Exactly.

27:20.480 --> 27:21.480
The government man.

27:21.480 --> 27:23.480
I don't know what's going on.

27:23.480 --> 27:27.480
The government man is taking your time away and he eats it.

27:27.480 --> 27:28.480
Is this Obama's fault?

27:28.480 --> 27:30.480
Is Obama hoarding my time?

27:30.480 --> 27:33.480
Do you know where that hour you lose goes?

27:33.480 --> 27:34.480
Where?

27:34.480 --> 27:35.480
It goes straight to the 1%.

27:35.480 --> 27:39.480
And they go out on a yacht and they spend all the poor people time.

27:39.480 --> 27:43.480
That's like that Justin Timberlake movie where they have the time in their arm and when it

27:43.480 --> 27:44.480
runs out they die.

27:44.480 --> 27:46.480
Where they keep looking at their watches.

27:46.480 --> 27:47.480
Uh-huh.

27:47.480 --> 27:52.480
And then Justin Timberlake is like, I'm going to instill a change in this unfair world.

27:52.480 --> 27:55.480
And he does it with the power of his song and dance.

27:55.480 --> 27:57.480
No, you haven't seen it have you?

27:57.480 --> 27:58.480
I did not see the film.

27:58.480 --> 27:59.480
Did not what?

27:59.480 --> 28:04.480
It's called Time to Sing and Dance.

28:04.480 --> 28:08.480
Can we not kickstart a horse?

28:08.480 --> 28:09.480
Guys.

28:09.480 --> 28:10.480
Are you saying that?

28:10.480 --> 28:11.480
Guys.

28:11.480 --> 28:12.480
No.

28:12.480 --> 28:13.480
Guys.

28:13.480 --> 28:14.480
We've talked about revving up the engine.

28:14.480 --> 28:18.480
We've got to get out of here.

28:18.480 --> 28:22.480
And that's the sound of it idling.

28:22.480 --> 28:23.480
Jon Bon Jovi.

28:23.480 --> 28:27.480
I'm not making a shitty metaphor between a horse and a motorcycle.

28:27.480 --> 28:28.480
What I'm saying to you is.

28:28.480 --> 28:30.480
Wait, he wasn't riding an actual steel horse?

28:30.480 --> 28:31.480
Oh my God.

28:31.480 --> 28:34.480
That would make it the fucking best song.

28:34.480 --> 28:38.480
On my cybernetic horse.

28:38.480 --> 28:42.480
I ride the wastelands of my katana.

28:42.480 --> 28:44.480
With my vibra sword.

28:44.480 --> 28:52.480
And my emerald visor.

28:52.480 --> 28:58.480
I smoke a pack of nano stems.

28:58.480 --> 28:59.480
Oh my God.

28:59.480 --> 29:00.480
I love that.

29:00.480 --> 29:01.480
Oh Jon.

29:01.480 --> 29:02.480
Somebody write that baby.

29:02.480 --> 29:05.480
I've seen a million faces.

29:05.480 --> 29:10.480
And I process them for fuel for my metal horse.

29:10.480 --> 29:12.480
I'm a cowboy.

29:12.480 --> 29:17.480
I sell water at a great profit.

29:17.480 --> 29:22.480
The land is not a myth.

29:22.480 --> 29:24.480
This Yahoo was sent in by two different people.

29:24.480 --> 29:25.480
One of whom was Jacob Blocker.

29:25.480 --> 29:27.480
One of whom was Jack Howard.

29:27.480 --> 29:28.480
I don't know how it happened.

29:28.480 --> 29:30.480
It's a mystical occurrence.

29:30.480 --> 29:32.480
Are they working together?

29:32.480 --> 29:33.480
I think that they fucking work together.

29:33.480 --> 29:35.480
Except they were sent like days apart.

29:35.480 --> 29:36.480
So they probably found it together.

29:36.480 --> 29:37.480
And then Jack was like.

29:37.480 --> 29:39.480
Yeah, let's wait until Tuesday to send this in.

29:39.480 --> 29:42.480
And then he fucking got the jump on it on Saturday.

29:42.480 --> 29:44.480
Anyway, thank you both.

29:44.480 --> 29:49.480
It's by Yahoo Institute's user, Manuel, who asks.

29:49.480 --> 29:54.480
Is it okay to eat in the bathroom at McDonald's?

29:54.480 --> 29:58.480
Hi.

29:58.480 --> 29:59.480
Hello.

29:59.480 --> 30:00.480
How are you?

30:00.480 --> 30:02.480
Whenever I go to McDonald's, I always eat in the bathroom.

30:02.480 --> 30:06.480
I've been doing this for five years now without a problem.

30:06.480 --> 30:11.480
I think that saying without a problem is very generous.

30:11.480 --> 30:14.480
Well, yeah, let's break that term down.

30:14.480 --> 30:18.480
Like the fucking McDonald's bouncer is not going to kick the door and be like.

30:18.480 --> 30:20.480
I've been following your trail for five years.

30:20.480 --> 30:23.480
It goes straight from the fucking cash register to the bathroom.

30:23.480 --> 30:25.480
So it was not a very difficult trail to follow.

30:25.480 --> 30:27.480
You've got to think, though, that if he's been going to the same McDonald's.

30:27.480 --> 30:30.480
That the cashiers are starting to talk.

30:30.480 --> 30:32.480
Oh, I hope he's not going to the same.

30:32.480 --> 30:35.480
I hope nobody's going to the same McDonald's.

30:35.480 --> 30:37.480
Except for that dude in Super Size Me.

30:37.480 --> 30:38.480
Oh, new guy.

30:38.480 --> 30:39.480
Don't worry.

30:39.480 --> 30:40.480
That's just Bathroom Steve.

30:40.480 --> 30:41.480
He's in Super Size Me.

30:41.480 --> 30:43.480
He's like, I ate five thousand Big Macs.

30:43.480 --> 30:44.480
I eat six a day.

30:44.480 --> 30:46.480
And it's like, that's great.

30:46.480 --> 30:48.480
But like, can you do them at different McDonald's?

30:48.480 --> 30:51.480
So they're not like, oh, here comes Big Mac Mac.

30:51.480 --> 30:52.480
Because his name's Mac.

30:52.480 --> 30:54.480
His name is also Mac.

30:54.480 --> 30:55.480
His name is also Mac.

30:55.480 --> 30:56.480
Can you?

30:56.480 --> 30:57.480
And it's like, why wouldn't you just call him Big Mac?

30:57.480 --> 30:58.480
If that's the case.

30:58.480 --> 30:59.480
Can you imagine?

30:59.480 --> 31:01.480
Because he was actually very thin, if I remember correctly.

31:01.480 --> 31:02.480
He was a thin man.

31:02.480 --> 31:04.480
You're on a road trip.

31:04.480 --> 31:05.480
You park.

31:05.480 --> 31:06.480
You pull into a McDonald's.

31:06.480 --> 31:07.480
You run.

31:07.480 --> 31:09.480
You make a rush for the bathroom.

31:09.480 --> 31:12.480
You're promising yourself that you'll go back and buy a Hi-C or something.

31:12.480 --> 31:14.480
You go to the bathroom.

31:14.480 --> 31:16.480
You open the stall door.

31:16.480 --> 31:21.480
And there's just this guy hunched over jamming chicken strips into his mouth.

31:21.480 --> 31:22.480
Occupied.

31:22.480 --> 31:23.480
Occupied.

31:23.480 --> 31:24.480
Occupado, my good man.

31:24.480 --> 31:26.480
Occupado flavor.

31:26.480 --> 31:30.480
Is he voiding, though, while he eats, is the question.

31:30.480 --> 31:31.480
I should hope not.

31:31.480 --> 31:32.480
Is this?

31:32.480 --> 31:35.480
Have we ever told a corncob story?

31:35.480 --> 31:37.480
I feel like we have to have told a corncob story.

31:37.480 --> 31:39.480
Because it's the best thing that's ever happened.

31:39.480 --> 31:41.480
To my knowledge, we have not.

31:41.480 --> 31:44.480
The perfect diagram of efficiency that is the corncob story.

31:44.480 --> 31:48.480
The corncob story is we were at a trailer park.

31:48.480 --> 31:50.480
Trailer park campground.

31:50.480 --> 31:53.480
We were staying there with our cousins or uncles.

31:53.480 --> 31:55.480
I think it was Tim and Tom, right?

31:55.480 --> 31:57.480
So we were staying there.

31:57.480 --> 31:59.480
And we were walking the grounds.

31:59.480 --> 32:00.480
Seeing the sights.

32:00.480 --> 32:01.480
Checking out.

32:01.480 --> 32:03.480
Scoping some whinnies.

32:03.480 --> 32:06.480
And we went to the bathroom.

32:06.480 --> 32:12.480
And it was one of those deplorable kinds of bathrooms with no doors on the stalls.

32:12.480 --> 32:14.480
So like those technically aren't even.

32:14.480 --> 32:15.480
Which are not bathrooms.

32:15.480 --> 32:16.480
In my opinion, they're not bathrooms.

32:16.480 --> 32:17.480
They're not bathrooms.

32:17.480 --> 32:20.480
They're risky water fountains, as far as I'm concerned.

32:20.480 --> 32:22.480
They're little public jails.

32:22.480 --> 32:25.480
And we walked in.

32:25.480 --> 32:30.480
And I was walking, you know, just checking to see if maybe one of these fucking stalls had a door on it.

32:30.480 --> 32:32.480
Because it's 1999.

32:32.480 --> 32:35.480
And we're living in a civilized goddamn world.

32:35.480 --> 32:37.480
Walked by one stall.

32:37.480 --> 32:42.480
And I didn't look long.

32:42.480 --> 32:45.480
Because it's like I guess a crime.

32:45.480 --> 32:47.480
But there was a little kid.

32:47.480 --> 32:49.480
And he's sitting there taking a poop.

32:49.480 --> 32:55.480
And while he was taking a poop, he was also eating some corn on the cob.

32:55.480 --> 32:58.480
He was eating his corn on the cob while voiding.

32:58.480 --> 33:02.480
And I walked out and made a hand gesture.

33:02.480 --> 33:03.480
I forget who was with me.

33:03.480 --> 33:06.480
I made a hand gesture like a fucking SWAT team.

33:06.480 --> 33:07.480
Like I can't talk.

33:07.480 --> 33:09.480
I'm about to lose my fucking mind laughing.

33:09.480 --> 33:12.480
You need to go walk eight feet in that direction.

33:12.480 --> 33:14.480
And look westward.

33:14.480 --> 33:19.480
Turn your eyes westward towards Corncob Boy.

33:19.480 --> 33:20.480
And then we'll talk.

33:20.480 --> 33:26.480
I did a little loop with my finger to say we will do some recon later on this.

33:26.480 --> 33:29.480
We will get together and discuss it in a group.

33:29.480 --> 33:31.480
Not now though.

33:31.480 --> 33:33.480
Not now.

33:33.480 --> 33:34.480
Not now.

33:34.480 --> 33:36.480
I need your total silence.

33:36.480 --> 33:37.480
I need you to walk there.

33:37.480 --> 33:42.480
I need it to be very clear that I did not say hey go check out this kid with no pants on.

33:42.480 --> 33:44.480
You have to keep it totally cash.

33:44.480 --> 33:45.480
You gotta keep it cash.

33:45.480 --> 33:46.480
Turn.

33:46.480 --> 33:47.480
Oh.

33:47.480 --> 33:48.480
Excuse me.

33:48.480 --> 33:49.480
Say like excuse me.

33:49.480 --> 33:51.480
Or how's that corn?

33:51.480 --> 33:52.480
Pretty good I bet.

33:52.480 --> 33:56.480
Since you couldn't fucking tear yourself away from it.

33:56.480 --> 33:59.480
Couldn't leave it on the picnic table.

33:59.480 --> 34:00.480
Go void.

34:00.480 --> 34:03.480
Go evacuate and then return to your biz.

34:03.480 --> 34:07.480
There was a moment in this kid's life where he was eating corn.

34:07.480 --> 34:11.480
Realized he needed to use the bathroom and thought well I can't leave this here.

34:11.480 --> 34:12.480
I get it.

34:12.480 --> 34:13.480
I mean he buttered it.

34:13.480 --> 34:15.480
And once you butter it it's like that's your day.

34:15.480 --> 34:16.480
Yeah.

34:16.480 --> 34:17.480
That's your day until it's done.

34:17.480 --> 34:19.480
That's your day.

34:19.480 --> 34:21.480
Have you ever thought about it from this kid's point of view?

34:21.480 --> 34:27.480
That maybe like Griffin's acknowledgement of him and like just the look on Griffin's face.

34:27.480 --> 34:28.480
Changed this kid's life.

34:28.480 --> 34:29.480
Turned his life around.

34:29.480 --> 34:30.480
He grew up Steve Jobs.

34:30.480 --> 34:32.480
He grew up super fast.

34:32.480 --> 34:34.480
He grew up Steve Jobs.

34:34.480 --> 34:37.480
This Yahoo answer was sent in by Reed.

34:37.480 --> 34:39.480
Thank you Reed.

34:39.480 --> 34:46.480
It's by Yahoo Answers user Miomi who asks well I quitted karate is that a good decision?

34:46.480 --> 34:48.480
Trainings are hard my bro told me to quit.

34:48.480 --> 34:49.480
Oh Jesus.

34:49.480 --> 34:50.480
Trainings are hard.

34:50.480 --> 34:54.480
My bro told me to quit because I didn't want to attend karate so I quitted.

34:54.480 --> 34:56.480
My parents don't.

34:56.480 --> 34:57.480
Hey did you.

34:57.480 --> 34:58.480
Were you found guilty for karate?

34:58.480 --> 35:01.480
No I was acquitted.

35:01.480 --> 35:05.480
My parents don't want me to quit because they wanted me to protect myself when I grow older.

35:05.480 --> 35:10.480
So is it a good or bad decision to quit?

35:10.480 --> 35:18.480
Do you guys know anybody who did karate coming up?

35:18.480 --> 35:19.480
Yes I do.

35:19.480 --> 35:20.480
I knew one.

35:20.480 --> 35:22.480
Chris Sizemore.

35:22.480 --> 35:23.480
Derek Moore.

35:23.480 --> 35:29.480
But like here's the thing I feel like there was a mythos around karate or all forms of

35:29.480 --> 35:34.480
kung fu and there still is which is I'm learning it for self-defense.

35:34.480 --> 35:41.480
I don't think that situation has ever unfolded organically in the history of pugilism.

35:41.480 --> 35:49.480
I think that somebody who has dedicated 20 years of their life to mastering kung fu and

35:49.480 --> 35:54.480
they get in one bar fight they in that bar fight in that moment that primal moment of

35:54.480 --> 35:58.480
punch they do not go what did my sensei teach me.

35:58.480 --> 36:03.480
See I disagree because I think in the moment of punch it probably comes up but like in

36:03.480 --> 36:07.480
the dark alley where dude like pulls a gun you're probably not thinking like I'm

36:07.480 --> 36:08.480
gonna cry.

36:08.480 --> 36:13.480
Well no because you're not gonna fucking like throw a ball of chi at him like that's

36:13.480 --> 36:14.480
obviously not gonna work.

36:14.480 --> 36:15.480
Oh have you guys seen that thing though?

36:15.480 --> 36:16.480
We totally do that.

36:16.480 --> 36:20.480
But when you're careening towards that drunk truck driver you're not gonna kung fu his

36:20.480 --> 36:23.480
car out of the way Travis.

36:23.480 --> 36:27.480
When this when the fucking sun explodes and we experience the heat death of the universe

36:27.480 --> 36:29.480
you're not gonna fucking kick your way out of that one.

36:29.480 --> 36:32.480
Can I tell you the funny thing is though as soon as someone says like self-defense I'm

36:32.480 --> 36:35.480
taking it for self-defense that is what I picture like fighting off.

36:35.480 --> 36:40.480
I'm 95 years old and this coronary is about to get me but let me just chop it.

36:40.480 --> 36:41.480
Done.

36:41.480 --> 36:42.480
Fixed it.

36:42.480 --> 36:45.480
Got it with a chop.

36:45.480 --> 36:47.480
90 years of kung fu paid off.

36:47.480 --> 36:54.480
People say they do it to defend themselves and if you really pound that math out it

36:54.480 --> 36:58.480
is a bad investment no matter which way it breaks.

36:58.480 --> 36:59.480
Inconceivable.

36:59.480 --> 37:05.480
In this situation in this situation that you're that you're envisioning you're in mano

37:05.480 --> 37:12.480
a mano combat hand-to-hand no weapons allowed because make no mistake my friend if you

37:12.480 --> 37:16.480
have karate and he has insert sharp thing here you lose.

37:16.480 --> 37:17.480
You lose.

37:17.480 --> 37:19.480
It's over you get stabbed.

37:19.480 --> 37:23.480
That's why that's why fucking knives and swords and guns were invented is because

37:23.480 --> 37:28.480
people like this fuckhole on yahoo is like karate is too hard I wish there was a substitute.

37:28.480 --> 37:34.480
Oh you're telling me this knife is worth a hundred billion years of karate okay I'll

37:34.480 --> 37:36.480
just take that then it's way easier.

37:36.480 --> 37:43.480
I uh I think that the the the the the big problem with with karate is I don't have an

37:43.480 --> 37:50.480
end of the sentence.

37:50.480 --> 37:58.480
Krav Magra now that's some shit that's some shit I can Krav Magra or Tim McGraw welcome

39:02.480 --> 39:11.480
it I like it I love it I chopped that guy's arm off take a chance okay let me tell you

39:11.480 --> 39:18.480
guys the story of the Terminator I will start from the beginning Sarah Sarah and her son

39:18.480 --> 39:28.480
John John her son John Sarah Connor is pregnant with a baby and Arnold Schwarzenegger is a

39:28.480 --> 39:36.480
robot a series 800 Terminator is he a dad what no sorry is he sorry is he the dad no

39:36.480 --> 39:41.480
he's a robot so so robots can't sorry sorry to keep interrupting you Justin baby half

39:41.480 --> 39:51.480
robot well I've seen Bicentennial Man okay and robots can like come and they can like

39:51.480 --> 39:56.480
create babies just like a normal person okay let me start again and this time I will replace

39:56.480 --> 40:01.480
the Terminator with Robin Williams robotic character from Bicentennial Man oh this is

40:01.480 --> 40:09.480
gonna be so much fun okay so Bicentennial Man as portrayed by Robin Williams travels

40:09.480 --> 40:16.480
is in a war in our future is in a war with humanity okay robots versus humans right does

40:16.480 --> 40:20.480
he have his skin and stuff yet or is he still like the creepy servo at this point he has

40:20.480 --> 40:25.480
skin okay so we're close to the end of the movie we're close to the end of the movie

40:25.480 --> 40:29.480
it's in our future but he's about to go to the beginning of the movie which is our past

40:29.480 --> 40:34.480
so back when he didn't have when he had just when he was just metal John Connor is leading

40:34.480 --> 40:41.480
humanity's revolt against robots this is the baby like the baby is doing this yes yes

40:41.480 --> 40:47.480
a baby from inside the womb fully grown John Connor is humanity's revolt against the robots

40:47.480 --> 40:51.480
okay so the robots like this is going bad I don't think we're gonna win this one and

40:51.480 --> 40:57.480
they're like well bullshit first off well this is the thing the robots never give up

40:57.480 --> 41:01.480
okay here's the thing I don't see the robot sitting around a table like listen guys we're

41:01.480 --> 41:07.480
blowing it listen guys I put a lot of thought into this and we had a good run in my guy

41:07.480 --> 41:13.480
this is what happens so listen so they make a bunch of robots that look like Arnold Schwarzenegger

41:13.480 --> 41:21.480
and now Arnold Schwarzenegger is it is a t800 but he's the 101 model so like his series

41:21.480 --> 41:27.480
is like his robotic abilities and that 101 refers to like his flesh covering which all

41:27.480 --> 41:31.480
look like Arnold Schwarzenegger so they sent him back in the past to kill John Connor's

41:31.480 --> 41:40.480
mom which seems harsh it seems harsh t2 Terminator 2 and that's right that's the end of the

41:40.480 --> 41:44.480
movie they send him back and say good luck and the movie is like thanks I'll do what

41:44.480 --> 41:56.480
I can't and bum bum bum bum so then okay so then t2 they tried again with a robot made

41:56.480 --> 42:01.480
of liquid but by this point the humans have their own Arnold Schwarzenegger and they sent

42:01.480 --> 42:09.480
him back to protect him from that and that's John Connor's dad that's debatable is John

42:09.480 --> 42:21.480
Connor's his own dad oh I saw the scene in the original t t1 uh-huh where um Arnold Schwarzenegger

42:21.480 --> 42:28.480
goes that woman's door is like are you Sarah Connor and she was like yes let me take out

42:28.480 --> 42:34.480
my chewing gum she was I said are you Sarah Connor yes I am and then he's like oh sorry

42:34.480 --> 42:42.480
are you the Sarah Connor that specifically the one that does has a baby and the baby

42:42.480 --> 42:49.480
and are you pregnant right now with a baby that just like feels like a like a few apocalyptic

42:49.480 --> 42:55.480
leader of men and she's like no that's not I'm like I'm like 60 years old it's clearly

42:55.480 --> 43:01.480
not me and he's like okay I apologize for the mistake have a nice day I love what you

43:01.480 --> 43:09.480
I love the tasteful the hedges in your yard they're good while I'm here do you know any

43:09.480 --> 43:14.480
other Sarah Connors that maybe you have like a daughter you're named after yourself did

43:14.480 --> 43:21.480
you name a daughter after yourself by the way I have good news about robot Jesus he's

43:21.480 --> 43:27.480
a new he's a new Jesus that I'm just gonna leave some pamphlets and a hundred years or

43:27.480 --> 43:34.480
so it's really gone as it's just sweep the nation you could get on board super early

43:34.480 --> 43:39.480
with robot Jesus I could I could leave you a few excerpts from the cyber that's a size

43:39.480 --> 43:49.480
that's a cyber Bible that robot Jesus wrote for you from the future no okay let's not

43:49.480 --> 43:57.480
try I'm gonna go his uh his oil will wash your heart clean if you want that that was

43:57.480 --> 44:07.480
a fucking super super good impression we all did if we had a fourth brother he would be

44:07.480 --> 44:12.480
indistinguishable from all sportsmaker because of diminishing returns and statistics you

44:12.480 --> 44:16.480
know a lot of people don't know this but doing a doing an Arnold Schwarzenegger impression

44:16.480 --> 44:22.480
is really easy just lower your voice slightly and mumble and apparently the only hard part

44:22.480 --> 44:29.480
is fighting the temptation to say anybody want a peanut definitely it is your same I

44:29.480 --> 44:43.480
just have an impression of a big man do you Jesse Ventura Oh hello I'm also a governor

44:43.480 --> 44:48.480
so Griff just side note should we make like a bunch of loud noise so it's easier to find

44:48.480 --> 44:54.480
the edit mark for when you cut out that giant section where we talk about Terminator now

44:54.480 --> 45:01.480
do you guys like huge dildos to give me some sort of metric because that could mean like

45:01.480 --> 45:08.480
my definition of what a huge dildo is is probably different than what yours is if it looks like

45:08.480 --> 45:13.480
something that the eye of Sauron would appear above like that's the kind of thing I'm talking

45:13.480 --> 45:20.480
about like I actually prefer a lot of really small dildos is that better for you and it's

45:20.480 --> 45:28.480
just cuter it's fun it's like a couple pins on a desk you know in that one scene in Fantasia

45:28.480 --> 45:32.480
where Mickey Mouse chops up the broom and it becomes a bunch of brooms it's like that

45:32.480 --> 45:38.480
but with dildos do they sell that on extreme restraints do they sell do they sell a young

45:38.480 --> 45:44.480
man's fancy on extreme restraints can you buy that can I buy my innocence back on I

45:44.480 --> 45:51.480
want to tell you guys about one very special dildo to me this is the annihilator X X and

45:51.480 --> 46:00.480
you guessed it X L dildo this thing extra access for excellence this man looks like

46:00.480 --> 46:09.480
he is cradling a poodle a black shiny poodle in front of his crotch is 18 inches long Christ

46:09.480 --> 46:15.480
nine pounds fuck how do you even how do you fucking operate that you got to have a trusted

46:15.480 --> 46:26.480
friend you have to have accomplished for this bill bow or running start either way I guess

46:26.480 --> 46:31.640
yeah I don't really understand let me let me zip on out of the comments and see the

46:31.640 --> 46:40.320
comments are all just like no no no no I love how flexible this one is and I love taking

46:40.320 --> 46:47.160
it all the way to the base I felt like I would explode now folks when you are leaving a product

46:47.160 --> 46:51.040
review on extremistrace.com it is so important to make sure it doesn't sound like you're

46:51.040 --> 46:57.920
bragging and this one seems very braggy to me it's like a backdoor brag I couldn't see

46:57.920 --> 47:02.560
my good though that was my husband many years ago suggested a threesome with his very well

47:02.560 --> 47:20.400
endowed best friend my husband's small only six inches long oh so he's still into threesomes

47:20.400 --> 47:28.280
I guess and anyway my husband a few years ago bought me this and OMG it's huge and intense

47:28.280 --> 47:33.680
I was lucky I have sex a lot but with a very big cock but this OMG it's on a different

47:33.680 --> 47:39.640
level and so am I I am addicted to feeling stretched Justin is no longer reading review

47:39.640 --> 47:45.600
he is just he's just letting his forming thoughts just forming thoughts in his brain and using

47:45.600 --> 47:52.200
his mouth to express them I actually love the power move of telling your wife you're

47:52.200 --> 47:56.480
gonna have a threesome with with your well endowed friend your well endowed friend gets

47:56.480 --> 48:01.080
out his wiener and then he turns his back for just a second and that's when you whip

48:01.080 --> 48:09.600
out the annihilator XXXL it really kills the appeal of Greg it also kills it also kills

48:09.600 --> 48:15.480
the person that it plunges into is there are there any reviews like I am typing this as

48:15.480 --> 48:24.080
I'm using it for the first time and am now dead this period I'm hitting the period hitting

48:24.080 --> 48:35.200
clicking the send button and dying they said annihilator and XXXL they were not at all

48:35.200 --> 48:46.040
joking this is the loved ones we came home David had been shucked like a pistachio but

48:46.040 --> 48:53.240
he sure did look happy thanks extreme he died with a smile on his face like a toddler ripping

48:53.240 --> 49:01.680
apart a fruit roll up just split right in twain he was I was looking at the horses and

49:01.680 --> 49:05.440
there's one that I wanted to point out to you specifically and it is my favorite name

49:05.440 --> 49:09.600
of a horse that is running in the Kentucky Derby and here it is are you ready for it

49:09.600 --> 49:18.800
yeah orb you know orb one I am orb orb one the Kentucky Derby well of course because

49:18.800 --> 49:26.960
that he has the maximum amount of space the maximum efficiency of space used in a geographic

49:26.960 --> 49:32.400
object well he also has the most streamlined name why everybody else has like those longs

49:32.400 --> 49:38.120
like you know like a Stevens left shoe or something you know and this is just orb yeah

49:38.120 --> 49:45.160
what if orb was what if that's what was a sentient yes lobe that insisted he was a horse

49:45.160 --> 49:52.840
I am orb I am a horse like your horses you must admit me to the race I am more not horse

49:52.840 --> 49:58.480
I am horse do not pay attention to how my horse legs don't touch the ground I'm a hub

49:58.480 --> 50:06.320
I am a hover well well well well well well well well well well I am horse please please

50:06.320 --> 50:15.680

50:24.480 --> 50:32.480

50:32.480 --> 50:40.360
with preferably a long a really good wingspan I'm going to need because I'm spherical and

50:40.360 --> 50:46.960
20 feet in diameter you might need to paint him with some kind of glue I must ironic I

50:46.960 --> 50:53.680
know I must win your horse your earth earth horse race so I may make love to your earth

50:53.680 --> 51:04.600
horse women did you guys say your names because mine's just an orb is a very sexual being

51:04.600 --> 51:13.680
I come from the advanced future of 5024 everyone is a geometric shape and everyone loves to

51:13.680 --> 51:22.960
party please find me a horse that I will not crush to death and make sure she's down make

51:22.960 --> 51:30.000
sure she's down to clown with a sex ball because orb is also only about consensual

51:30.000 --> 51:37.800
sex do people in the pokemon universe eat pokemon pokemon seem to be the only animals

51:37.800 --> 51:42.720
around the world created by the show and games do the humans who live there eat pokemon considering

51:42.720 --> 51:46.040
that they can all be caught and trained they obviously have some sort of intelligence so

51:46.040 --> 51:49.880
would eating them be in violation of some sort of ethical code the only way around this

51:49.880 --> 51:53.760
I suppose would be if everyone was vegetarian but I don't see much evidence to support

51:53.760 --> 52:01.720
either side what do you think definitely ooh tricky tricky quandary tricky conundrum it's

52:01.720 --> 52:05.560
hard to catch them all if you keep fucking getting high on your own supply so to speak

52:05.560 --> 52:13.640
I feel like okay so practically speaking in the world of pokemon the battling and competition

52:13.640 --> 52:18.320
of pokemon is a huge business I mean it's like the most important thing in their world

52:18.320 --> 52:24.120
right yeah I mean it's on it's on tv it's on tv the highest thing you can world celebrities

52:24.120 --> 52:30.080
the highest status you can hope to achieve is to be the the you know the master you know

52:30.080 --> 52:39.400
what I mean like so the victor I I asked this because it seems like they would be too expensive

52:39.400 --> 52:46.480
to eat like anytime you eat one it's like eating a show pony I guess but the supply

52:46.480 --> 52:50.560
and demand is off there because you can just fucking walk in the grass and then there you

52:50.560 --> 52:55.240
go yeah nobody's nobody's eating like mew but people are probably eating pidgey left

52:55.240 --> 53:03.040
you're saying there's a hierarchy of edible pokemon and you're saying near the bottom

53:03.040 --> 53:09.760
of that is a pidgey is a magic carp and then what's the mouse one retata retata but he's

53:09.760 --> 53:13.600
probably in there oh I could go for a retata frittata right now it would be so good yum

53:13.600 --> 53:16.680
yum definitely but you're saying everybody's probably eating slowpoke they're probably

53:16.680 --> 53:22.440
eating snorlax because they're like herd animals sure snorlax is not snorlax is actually fairly

53:22.440 --> 53:31.680
rare but I I understand what you're saying um god I ate my snorlax what if you just wander

53:31.680 --> 53:37.040
up to the campfire and you see someone guiltily eating a snorlax and then you tell them like

53:37.040 --> 53:42.160
no he was like really valuable there's like two of those in this whole game but at the

53:42.160 --> 53:49.160
same time though you gotta keep in mind there's only one mewtwo you can catch right I bet

53:49.160 --> 53:57.000
he is fucking delectable because because of the rarity of it that's the thing only the

53:57.000 --> 54:02.960
super rich can afford to eat mewtwo now that's a tricky one because he's he can speak english

54:02.960 --> 54:06.900
according to the first movie okay that gets weird oh no he speaks the king's english so

54:06.900 --> 54:13.000
like that would be that would be uncomfortable unless you only ate just a little bit well

54:13.000 --> 54:18.120
you could do like one leg at a time yeah precisely and then you could still have the pokemon

54:18.120 --> 54:22.800
that would be an interesting twist because like i've reviewed pretty much every game

54:22.800 --> 54:27.080
that has ever come out for that series and you know it's a little stale it needs something

54:27.080 --> 54:31.960
to shake up the franchise what if you get your starter pokemon and you just eat it instantly

54:31.960 --> 54:37.520
right in front of them right in front which one do i want which one do i want i'll take

54:37.520 --> 54:44.480
the grass type let me get a little ranch can i have another one nope ah shit game over

54:44.480 --> 54:50.040
into the game if your list of pokemon gets full and you want to catch another one you

54:50.040 --> 54:54.720
have to eat it there's no storing it you store it in your belly and you convert it to calorie

54:54.720 --> 54:59.360
energy and it's not just like a pop-up like you've eaten it like you have to actively

54:59.360 --> 55:05.920
do it and if you if you press the buttons wrong it goes from like a smooth easy mercy

55:05.920 --> 55:11.620
killing to like a botched really horrible experiment i think there needs to be some

55:11.620 --> 55:17.160
recognition of the of the food chain of survival in the fittest because let's be honest if

55:17.160 --> 55:21.880
you're out in the environment you've got all your pokemon are are knocked out except for

55:21.880 --> 55:26.680
one and you fight like a fucking alligator and he kills your last pokemon you're not

55:26.680 --> 55:32.880
just gonna fall asleep and wake up in a pokemon center you'll be killed you'll be devoured

55:32.880 --> 55:36.620
