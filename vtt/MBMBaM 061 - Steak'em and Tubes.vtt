00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.640 --> 00:48.240
Welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me, an advice show for the modern era.

00:48.240 --> 00:50.960
A lot of people ask, Justin, why do you keep recording this show?

00:52.000 --> 00:57.600
They say, it angers as many people as it helps. Why do you keep recording it?

00:57.600 --> 01:02.720
And I keep recording it because every week we try to come up with

01:02.720 --> 01:08.880
some topical thing to talk about to begin our program, and I get Travis's suggestions.

01:09.440 --> 01:11.200
Travis, you should introduce yourself.

01:11.200 --> 01:13.440
Oh, hello, I'm Travis McElroy.

01:13.440 --> 01:15.840
Uh-huh, and Griffin, you're up in this piece too, right?

01:16.560 --> 01:19.760
I am all up in this bitch, in it to win it.

01:19.760 --> 01:22.240
In it to win it. Travis, why don't you hit everybody

01:22.240 --> 01:26.560
with what your big suggestions were for this week? And I don't want any editorializing,

01:26.560 --> 01:32.320
I just want you to list the topics that you suggested for our comedy podcast to kick off with.

01:32.320 --> 01:36.800
Okay, well, the first was simply debt ceiling.

01:36.800 --> 01:40.560
Debt ceiling, yeah, who's ready to laugh?

01:40.560 --> 01:43.600
Number two, Grease is going into default.

01:44.400 --> 01:48.800
Now, if you get some like hand jive, Olivia Newton, John action in there,

01:50.960 --> 01:54.880
I think you could maybe get something going.

01:54.880 --> 02:02.480
Travis, I know what all those words, isolated, what they mean, together though,

02:02.480 --> 02:05.520
not quite so sure what a default.

02:05.520 --> 02:10.000
I thought the third one was the real gem that I really thought we could have mined

02:10.000 --> 02:15.840
for comedy, but it was Monte Carlo is coming out starring Selena Gomez.

02:15.840 --> 02:17.600
Oh, you mean The Big Race?

02:17.600 --> 02:21.200
Yeah, The Big Race, that's news. If we could just talk about The Race, like the formula.

02:21.200 --> 02:25.200
Oh no, it's a comedy movie for tweens.

02:25.200 --> 02:28.320
Oh yeah, and you would say you're pretty excited.

02:28.960 --> 02:30.240
Well, Andy McDowell's in it.

02:30.800 --> 02:33.280
Oh shit, that national treasure.

02:33.280 --> 02:35.280
She's my number one celebrity crush.

02:35.280 --> 02:43.760
Whichever pulse you have your finger on, can you stop touching that person,

02:44.320 --> 02:45.840
that person that you're touching?

02:45.840 --> 02:47.680
It's actually Selena Gomez.

02:47.680 --> 02:48.640
That's right, I know.

02:48.640 --> 02:49.920
I have a direct pipeline to Selena Gomez.

02:49.920 --> 02:52.880
I am extraordinarily uncomfortable with it.

02:53.760 --> 02:58.560
How about the fact that gay dudes and ladies can now get married in New York?

02:58.560 --> 03:00.080
Oh fuck, that's way better.

03:00.080 --> 03:01.280
That's way better.

03:01.280 --> 03:01.760
Damn it.

03:01.760 --> 03:03.920
Oh no, but hold on, wait.

03:03.920 --> 03:05.040
Because let's balance these two.

03:05.040 --> 03:08.240
Let's put these two on the scales of justice, because what's more important?

03:09.200 --> 03:12.880
Gay marriage or Selena Gomez.

03:14.560 --> 03:16.640
A Selena Gomez full-length feature film.

03:17.280 --> 03:19.040
I really like Selena Gomez.

03:19.040 --> 03:20.880
I think she's a rising star.

03:20.880 --> 03:24.240
I just want to get married to Tim Gunn, and I don't think that's so wrong, is it?

03:24.880 --> 03:26.400
I want to get married to Justin Bieber.

03:27.360 --> 03:30.560
You guys remember Justin's first date with Tim Gunn?

03:30.560 --> 03:33.680
Yeah, they went and saw Monte Carlo with Selena Gomez.

03:35.280 --> 03:37.920
They necked the entire time, he really made it work.

03:37.920 --> 03:41.360
Yeah, the junior mints were mushy, but the sex was neat.

03:41.360 --> 03:51.120
I just imagine Tim Gunn's sex face and put me into a state.

03:51.120 --> 03:53.440
It put me in a state that I'm not comfortable with.

03:53.440 --> 03:54.400
Yeah, New York.

03:54.400 --> 03:54.960
New York.

03:54.960 --> 03:58.080
Because you're a bigot, and you're uncomfortable with the gay marriage.

03:58.080 --> 03:59.760
It's now legal there.

04:00.800 --> 04:03.440
So this is, of course, our advice program.

04:03.440 --> 04:07.840
We record it for you every week to help you with the little things that pop up in your life.

04:07.840 --> 04:12.720
We also talk to each other about the things that are going on in our lives,

04:12.720 --> 04:13.760
because it's a helping show.

04:13.760 --> 04:17.200
Can I say something real quick about the New York past and the gay marriage?

04:17.920 --> 04:21.680
There's nothing in this earth that would make me stop you from talking more about it.

04:21.680 --> 04:26.560
There were four Republican senators that voted for it, and like, yeah, gay marriage rules.

04:26.560 --> 04:28.560
There was one Republican who was like, listen,

04:28.560 --> 04:31.680
this is a vote of conscience and not a vote of party line.

04:31.680 --> 04:35.600
I actually remember in my middle school social studies class,

04:35.600 --> 04:40.400
I learned that every vote in the Senate is a vote of conscience,

04:40.400 --> 04:43.360
because if you're asleep, they won't let you govern.

04:43.360 --> 04:45.680
They won't let you act in a political body.

04:46.560 --> 04:49.760
You will allow me to pronounce that word as conscience.

04:49.760 --> 04:51.120
Then I will pronounce it better.

04:52.800 --> 04:53.600
I won't.

04:53.600 --> 04:54.560
I absolutely won't.

04:55.440 --> 04:56.960
You guys are breaking my heart.

04:56.960 --> 04:58.080
Let's take the first question.

04:59.040 --> 05:02.560
I love my girlfriend, but she keeps eating off my plate

05:02.560 --> 05:04.960
when she has perfectly good food in front of her.

05:04.960 --> 05:07.920
She'll order what she wants, and then she looks longingly at what I got

05:07.920 --> 05:10.000
until I ask if she wants a bite.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.920
How can I put a stop to this without sounding like a selfish jerk?

05:13.920 --> 05:15.600
Hungry like the wolf.

05:17.360 --> 05:18.640
Why are you so hungry?

05:18.640 --> 05:20.720
Hey, dog, like, chill out.

05:20.720 --> 05:21.920
You live in America.

05:21.920 --> 05:24.800
Like, if you don't get enough food right now at this meal,

05:24.800 --> 05:29.280
literally, if you scoop your hand through the nearest gutter,

05:29.280 --> 05:32.080
you'll come up with, like, a hot dog or something.

05:32.080 --> 05:33.360
At least four ho-hos.

05:33.360 --> 05:35.280
Like, you'll be fine.

05:35.280 --> 05:36.720
I'm totally on his side.

05:36.720 --> 05:37.360
Of course.

05:37.360 --> 05:38.080
Oh, come on.

05:38.080 --> 05:39.120
That's his food.

05:39.680 --> 05:40.160
It's not.

05:40.800 --> 05:42.400
That's what a relationship is.

05:42.400 --> 05:47.360
If a relationship is not, at the very least, about sharing your food,

05:47.360 --> 05:51.520
like, that's, like, the most basic survival-level post-apocalyptic,

05:51.520 --> 05:54.800
like, hi, I found this half-eaten Hershey bar.

05:54.800 --> 05:56.480
Well, I have a beef turkey.

05:56.480 --> 05:57.680
Well, let's have a relationship.

05:57.680 --> 05:59.280
Like, this is the base relationship.

05:59.280 --> 06:00.480
The basest one we can have.

06:00.480 --> 06:03.520
Well, here's, okay, I have a suggestion.

06:03.520 --> 06:07.040
Make her order first and then order the exact same thing she gets.

06:07.760 --> 06:08.080
Okay.

06:09.040 --> 06:10.400
She'll never see that coming.

06:11.600 --> 06:12.640
Does she order a salad?

06:12.640 --> 06:13.840
My wife does that a lot.

06:13.840 --> 06:15.760
If she orders a salad, you get a salad.

06:15.760 --> 06:17.840
Like, this is gonna be a long game.

06:17.840 --> 06:20.000
I'll get something delicious because I'm overweight

06:20.000 --> 06:21.600
and I know what things taste good.

06:21.600 --> 06:23.200
It's the one, like, perk of the gig.

06:23.760 --> 06:25.760
And she'll, like, say, hey, that looks good.

06:25.760 --> 06:26.560
It's like, yeah, no shit.

06:26.560 --> 06:27.440
I've been at this for a while.

06:27.440 --> 06:32.320
This ain't my first time at the steak rodeo.

06:32.320 --> 06:32.480
Yeah.

06:33.440 --> 06:36.800
And also, can we stop coming to the steak rodeo?

06:36.800 --> 06:39.280
It smells like old wallpaper and I hate it here.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.560
There's peanut shells on the floor, but they don't serve peanuts.

06:44.640 --> 06:46.400
Where do all these peanuts come from?

06:47.200 --> 06:48.640
Ma'am, excuse me, ma'am.

06:49.200 --> 06:51.760
Can I be reseated in the non-peanut section?

06:51.760 --> 06:52.560
That doesn't exist.

06:54.960 --> 06:57.040
Yeah, I mean, like, just share your food.

06:57.040 --> 06:58.160
It's not a big deal.

06:58.160 --> 06:58.800
You know what?

06:58.800 --> 06:59.920
Here's what you do.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.440
If this is really that important to you-

07:01.440 --> 07:02.640
Sit at different tables.

07:03.440 --> 07:03.680
What?

07:04.720 --> 07:08.880
You, uh, when she starts eating off your plate,

07:08.880 --> 07:09.680
order another one.

07:10.480 --> 07:11.360
I say, hold on.

07:11.360 --> 07:12.560
No, we can make this work.

07:12.560 --> 07:13.520
I'll get a second one for you.

07:13.520 --> 07:14.320
You've touched this.

07:14.320 --> 07:15.360
I don't want it anymore.

07:15.360 --> 07:17.360
So you're saying always, like, order-

07:17.360 --> 07:19.440
I will have two of that, please.

07:19.440 --> 07:21.760
I'll have two of those, please.

07:21.760 --> 07:22.560
You know, I'll do that.

07:22.560 --> 07:22.800
Okay.

07:23.600 --> 07:25.440
This is something that I've started doing.

07:25.440 --> 07:28.160
I order two meals when I go to a restaurant

07:28.160 --> 07:32.560
with the express purpose of intending to take one home

07:32.560 --> 07:33.280
and eat it later.

07:34.080 --> 07:34.960
You do do that.

07:37.120 --> 07:38.240
How is that weird?

07:38.240 --> 07:41.440
Don't make that sound like a thing that you do constantly.

07:41.440 --> 07:42.160
Because you don't.

07:42.160 --> 07:42.480
No, no.

07:42.480 --> 07:46.640
If you did it constantly, you would be some sort of glutton.

07:46.640 --> 07:47.680
Some sort of gluten.

07:47.680 --> 07:49.600
No, not constantly.

07:49.600 --> 07:53.760
But like, if I go to a brunch place, I'll get two brunches.

07:53.760 --> 07:56.000
Now, sometimes the spirit will overtake me

07:56.000 --> 07:58.720
and I will eat both of them in one sitting.

07:59.600 --> 08:03.360
I will admit to the last time I went to the Chili Willys

08:03.360 --> 08:05.360
and I was getting so their delicious Texas Red,

08:06.000 --> 08:07.600
I did order carry out.

08:07.600 --> 08:10.400
I got two of them with the express purpose

08:10.400 --> 08:12.960
of eating one of them the next day.

08:14.000 --> 08:14.800
Is that cool?

08:14.800 --> 08:16.400
Is it just the restaurant thing?

08:16.400 --> 08:17.760
That's not normal, you guys.

08:17.760 --> 08:18.800
Why is that not normal?

08:18.800 --> 08:21.280
I think that that's planning ahead.

08:21.280 --> 08:22.800
I think that's kind of brilliant.

08:22.800 --> 08:25.120
Well, where does that fucking stop?

08:25.120 --> 08:28.480
Can you be like, hey, let me get seven cups

08:28.480 --> 08:30.560
of that sweet Texas Red.

08:31.360 --> 08:33.120
Daddy's going to have a chili week.

08:33.120 --> 08:34.480
Happy chili week, everybody.

08:35.760 --> 08:37.280
You try to paint that like a bad thing.

08:37.280 --> 08:38.880
I think that's an awesome idea.

08:38.880 --> 08:40.960
Yeah, like is anyone hungry?

08:40.960 --> 08:42.480
I have all the chili.

08:42.480 --> 08:43.360
Do you want that?

08:43.360 --> 08:44.240
I mean, I have it.

08:44.240 --> 08:45.120
Watch out for that guy.

08:45.120 --> 08:47.840
He'll come in and order just like a month worth of chili.

08:47.840 --> 08:48.960
It's chili Steve.

08:48.960 --> 08:52.560
When you come here sometimes and you're like,

08:52.560 --> 08:53.840
Griffin, I don't know where the money,

08:53.840 --> 08:55.440
like, I don't know where my money is.

08:55.440 --> 08:56.240
Like my money.

08:56.240 --> 08:58.240
Where did all the money go, Griffin?

08:58.240 --> 09:00.480
And I'll say, Travis, it's, do you remember

09:00.480 --> 09:03.760
how you ate 14 steaks from Outback Steakhouse last week?

09:04.320 --> 09:06.720
You got one in the restaurant and you said,

09:06.720 --> 09:09.200
let me get a baker's dozen of steak to go.

09:09.840 --> 09:10.800
That's where it all went.

09:11.840 --> 09:13.760
To be fair, I said a staker's dozen.

09:13.760 --> 09:18.240
I was wondering if you could help me out with a friend of mine.

09:18.240 --> 09:21.360
I like this guy a lot, but he has to make it known

09:21.360 --> 09:22.720
that he's a vegetarian.

09:22.720 --> 09:25.520
He usually doesn't mention it around close friends.

09:25.520 --> 09:27.840
However, I've been noticing whenever he's communicating

09:27.840 --> 09:30.320
to new people, one of the first things that he asks,

09:30.320 --> 09:32.240
it says is that he's a vegetarian.

09:32.240 --> 09:33.600
I want to tell him he's being a snob,

09:33.600 --> 09:35.440
but that nobody cares what he puts in his mouth.

09:35.440 --> 09:36.320
Only what comes out.

09:37.680 --> 09:38.320
Like puke?

09:38.320 --> 09:41.040
Yeah, whenever I even bring it up,

09:41.040 --> 09:43.840
he lashes out at me and thinks I'm attacking him.

09:43.840 --> 09:48.000
Is he really being a snob or am I just overthinking it?

09:48.000 --> 09:49.120
Help me, brothers.

09:49.120 --> 09:51.280
And that's from Mr. Bixby.

09:51.280 --> 09:53.440
I think it depends on how he's saying it.

09:54.320 --> 09:55.120
Oh, me?

09:55.120 --> 09:56.080
Me?

09:56.080 --> 09:57.920
My eating preferences?

09:57.920 --> 09:59.200
I'm a vegetarian.

09:59.200 --> 09:59.760
Sit down.

09:59.760 --> 10:00.640
Let me tell you about it.

10:00.640 --> 10:04.000
No steak for me, thanks.

10:04.000 --> 10:04.880
We're at a carwash.

10:04.880 --> 10:08.320
Like, why would that even be in the equation?

10:08.320 --> 10:11.280
Why would that even be in the equation?

10:11.280 --> 10:13.200
I hope that's free range prawn.

10:14.480 --> 10:14.720
What?

10:16.720 --> 10:18.320
He's probably not being a snob.

10:18.320 --> 10:20.560
I don't know that people can be a snob.

10:20.560 --> 10:21.600
I mean, they definitely can be.

10:21.600 --> 10:23.040
You can be a snob about anything.

10:23.040 --> 10:28.320
But I mean, that's such a big part of a person's life.

10:28.320 --> 10:35.680
If they're a vegetarian or vegan or only eats translucent foods.

10:35.680 --> 10:36.960
Yeah, but at the same time-

10:36.960 --> 10:39.280
I only eat dark fruits.

10:39.280 --> 10:43.680
Like, I think that's such a big part of their life that like, yeah,

10:43.680 --> 10:44.480
they're going to talk about it.

10:44.480 --> 10:47.680
But I don't introduce myself as Travis McElroy Omnivore.

10:47.680 --> 10:49.680
No, but because that's the norm.

10:49.680 --> 10:51.120
It does say on your business cards, though.

10:51.120 --> 10:51.760
Well, yes.

10:51.760 --> 10:53.440
Let's not play make-believe here.

10:53.440 --> 10:55.440
You are not an omnivore, sir.

10:55.440 --> 10:56.320
I eat everything.

10:57.200 --> 10:59.200
I don't think omnivore is the correct name for that.

10:59.760 --> 11:05.120
Can we say a part-time herbivore, maybe?

11:05.120 --> 11:07.760
Like a practicing carnivore.

11:08.640 --> 11:09.680
I dabble.

11:09.680 --> 11:11.280
I dabble in vegetables.

11:12.800 --> 11:15.440
You like to check in every once in a while, see what's new on the scene,

11:15.440 --> 11:18.400
but you're not like blogging about them.

11:18.400 --> 11:20.480
Yeah, I'm not like super committed.

11:20.480 --> 11:24.240
I'm like a Christmas and Easter herbivore.

11:25.040 --> 11:26.080
Right, I can dig it.

11:27.120 --> 11:28.320
But that's the norm, right?

11:28.320 --> 11:30.400
Like everybody eats everything, right?

11:30.400 --> 11:32.560
Except for those three or four people who don't.

11:32.560 --> 11:36.240
So those three or four people get to bring it up, is what you're saying?

11:36.240 --> 11:40.560
They have denied themselves life's greatest pleasure, which is to say bacon.

11:42.480 --> 11:43.840
They can do whatever they want.

11:43.840 --> 11:45.280
They've earned it.

11:45.280 --> 11:47.920
Yeah, but who gives a shit?

11:47.920 --> 11:48.640
I don't care.

11:50.560 --> 11:52.400
Maybe it's part of their identity.

11:52.400 --> 11:58.960
But it's not something that should determine whether or not you want to hang out with a person.

11:58.960 --> 12:01.440
So if you're meeting someone for the first time and they're like,

12:01.440 --> 12:04.640
oh, and by the way, I'm a vegetarian, you're like, fuck it, I'm out.

12:04.640 --> 12:06.480
It does if you're ahead of lettuce.

12:06.480 --> 12:06.720
Yeah.

12:07.360 --> 12:08.400
Who can relax then?

12:09.360 --> 12:09.760
What's up?

12:09.760 --> 12:10.960
Cucumber fingers?

12:10.960 --> 12:11.920
Oops, they're gone.

12:12.880 --> 12:13.360
Shoot off.

12:13.360 --> 12:14.880
Crunch, crunch, crunch, crunch.

12:14.880 --> 12:18.080
An important question, too, is how long has he been a vegetarian?

12:18.080 --> 12:21.680
Because if it's like within the last three months, he's totally being a snob.

12:21.680 --> 12:23.520
Maybe he's just telling everybody he's a vegetarian

12:23.520 --> 12:25.520
so he has some excuse for when he faints later.

12:26.240 --> 12:28.240
I'm sorry I don't get enough vegetables.

12:28.240 --> 12:32.160
Or so people like try to encourage him to eat bacon and then he's like, what?

12:32.160 --> 12:33.200
No, okay.

12:34.880 --> 12:37.200
Jerry, why is your blood so light?

12:38.240 --> 12:39.680
It's like your blood isn't even there.

12:41.120 --> 12:42.240
I mean, I think it matters.

12:42.240 --> 12:47.280
I think it's a big part of a person because what if you start crushing on a vegetarian

12:47.840 --> 12:50.800
and you don't know they're a vegetarian, though, and you ask them to go to Sizzler?

12:52.640 --> 12:53.680
Love ruined.

12:53.680 --> 12:56.320
Relationship gone.

12:56.320 --> 12:59.760
I think if your first date's to the Sizzler, that ship's sailed.

12:59.760 --> 13:00.480
That ship's already-

13:00.480 --> 13:01.520
That's a good restaurant.

13:02.640 --> 13:03.600
I haven't been recently.

13:03.600 --> 13:04.720
Have they revamped the menu?

13:06.480 --> 13:09.280
No, it's still pretty much the same.

13:09.280 --> 13:14.000
It's still pretty much like steaks and you can get the steaks cooked however you want them.

13:14.000 --> 13:14.720
Oh, man.

13:14.720 --> 13:16.000
However you want them?

13:16.000 --> 13:20.080
Sometimes there's potatoes, but there's like a secret language.

13:20.080 --> 13:21.840
It's kind of like ordering it in and out.

13:21.840 --> 13:29.920
You got to say, can I get a steakham and tubes and they know that when you say tubes-

13:29.920 --> 13:31.440
Is that really how it is?

13:32.080 --> 13:36.640
You say steakham and tubes and when you say tubes, they know that you mean tube.

13:36.640 --> 13:38.640
I need a steakham and tubes.

13:38.640 --> 13:40.240
I need it slarshed and dumps.

13:43.440 --> 13:44.240
They look at you.

13:44.240 --> 13:46.800
They say, that is not real steak.

13:46.800 --> 13:47.680
With a Pepsi.

13:48.240 --> 13:50.320
I need a steakham and tubes.

13:50.320 --> 13:52.000
I need it slarshed and dumps.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.520
Can I get two Megatators and-

13:55.120 --> 13:58.560
To be fair, that was my favorite sci-fi channel movie.

13:58.560 --> 14:01.360
I'd like two Megatators fully cheesed out.

14:01.360 --> 14:03.200
Just sizzle the whole plate if you can.

14:04.800 --> 14:05.680
Sour creamo.

14:06.960 --> 14:08.640
That's not a good password though.

14:10.800 --> 14:11.840
Yes, you're right.

14:11.840 --> 14:13.280
Not sour cream.

14:13.280 --> 14:14.960
Like fresh cream.

14:14.960 --> 14:18.240
That worked because that's sort of like reverse psychology.

14:18.240 --> 14:19.520
You guys want a yahoo?

14:19.520 --> 14:20.000
Yes, please.

14:20.000 --> 14:20.800
You know I do.

14:22.240 --> 14:22.800
How about this one?

14:22.800 --> 14:24.240
It was sent in by Gabe Gysin.

14:24.240 --> 14:24.800
Thank you, Gabe.

14:25.440 --> 14:28.080
It's by yahoo answers user Pat who asks,

14:30.240 --> 14:32.960
Is the matrix real and is it possible?

14:34.640 --> 14:36.800
Simple question, argued answer.

14:37.920 --> 14:38.560
What?

14:38.560 --> 14:42.240
Is the matrix real and are we biological batteries?

14:42.240 --> 14:46.560
And is the human body capable of producing enough energy to power an entire world of machines

14:46.560 --> 14:48.320
if there were six billion of us?

14:48.320 --> 14:50.000
And if so, how would we get out?

14:50.000 --> 14:51.440
Self-substantion?

14:51.440 --> 14:52.400
Suicide.

14:52.400 --> 14:55.200
Or is there someone who could free us?

14:55.200 --> 14:56.240
Red pill.

14:56.240 --> 14:58.240
Please take this question seriously.

14:58.240 --> 15:00.160
No sarcasm or blatant humor.

15:00.160 --> 15:00.560
Thank you.

15:00.560 --> 15:04.560
Boy, when you have to say that right in the question, you were just begging for it.

15:04.560 --> 15:05.680
No blatant humor.

15:05.680 --> 15:06.960
I don't care if you like-

15:06.960 --> 15:08.640
I'm like supes dumb.

15:08.640 --> 15:10.640
So if you want to say shit that's like,

15:10.640 --> 15:11.680
I'm not going to understand.

15:11.680 --> 15:12.320
You're making fun of me.

15:12.320 --> 15:12.480
That's supposed to-

15:12.480 --> 15:16.400
I want to fucking punch this dude mostly because of this-

15:16.400 --> 15:19.520
the phrase, simple question, argued answer.

15:19.520 --> 15:20.480
Here's the problem, Travis.

15:20.480 --> 15:25.760
You try to punch this guy and he dodges it in slow motion

15:25.760 --> 15:28.000
and turns into like three or four different guys.

15:28.800 --> 15:31.120
I want to meet the people that are arguing about this.

15:31.680 --> 15:33.520
Oh, you know they exist, right?

15:33.520 --> 15:34.560
Oh, of course.

15:34.560 --> 15:35.280
Yeah, because you can't-

15:35.280 --> 15:36.800
It's one of those you can't prove it.

15:37.520 --> 15:38.160
You can't-

15:38.160 --> 15:38.880
You can't pro-

15:38.880 --> 15:41.680
Like anything you could create, you know, to-

15:41.680 --> 15:46.560
to refute it could just be another creation of the matrix.

15:46.560 --> 15:48.240
You're just another agent, man.

15:48.240 --> 15:48.720
Yeah.

15:48.720 --> 15:51.520
Like, we've all thought about it, right?

15:51.520 --> 15:53.200
Like we've all just sat down-

15:53.200 --> 15:56.400
We had that moment when we were on a bunch of drugs.

15:56.400 --> 16:00.720
In that deep dark truthful mirror and saw that in that mirror

16:00.720 --> 16:03.600
we were covered in metallic juices

16:03.600 --> 16:05.600
and then we were transported to the real world.

16:05.600 --> 16:07.040
Yeah, you know what though, Griffin,

16:07.040 --> 16:08.800
I think we've all had that thought, but you know what?

16:08.800 --> 16:13.040
I had it back in 19 fucking 99 when the movie was released.

16:13.040 --> 16:15.760
I'm not still kicking that around in 2011

16:16.320 --> 16:17.840
and thinking like, oh, maybe.

16:17.840 --> 16:19.200
Like, it's been 12 years.

16:19.200 --> 16:20.080
Maybe not.

16:20.080 --> 16:22.720
Like, probably that is not the-

16:22.720 --> 16:24.960
that is one construction that you could believe in,

16:24.960 --> 16:27.120
but I am not subscribing to it.

16:27.760 --> 16:33.200
I mean, look, some people go their whole lives without waking up, you know?

16:33.200 --> 16:34.000
Uh-huh, yeah.

16:34.000 --> 16:34.960
Come on, copper talk.

16:35.760 --> 16:36.800
Some people go their whole-

16:36.800 --> 16:38.080
I mean, that's all there is.

16:38.080 --> 16:41.280
It's like, what if we are flesh batteries?

16:42.320 --> 16:47.120
Like, there's only 10 of us who've made it out to the hallowed halls of Zion.

16:47.120 --> 16:47.600
Like, what?

16:48.320 --> 16:49.280
In the rave, in the origin-

16:49.280 --> 16:53.840
In the rave underground fucking rubbing my dirty, dirty body on everyone.

16:53.840 --> 16:54.000
Like-

16:56.240 --> 16:59.040
Lawrence Fishburne spray oil on the crowd.

16:59.040 --> 17:01.600
I know 10 person rave is a really shitty rave.

17:01.600 --> 17:06.800
TJ Fishburne, he's on the ones and twos and he's getting wet in Zion

17:06.800 --> 17:09.680
and like, you're in here, you're on earth,

17:09.680 --> 17:11.680
and you're laughing at somebody on Yahoo Answers.

17:11.680 --> 17:12.400
How's your life?

17:12.400 --> 17:14.000
What gives you the right?

17:16.480 --> 17:17.120
You could be-

17:17.120 --> 17:20.640
You could be bumping to the sounds of DJ Fishburne,

17:21.520 --> 17:27.120
letting his smooth grooves propel you to a higher plane of funky existence.

17:27.120 --> 17:28.000
And here you are.

17:28.000 --> 17:32.160
DJ Cowboy Curtis is mixing up the Chemical Brothers for everybody.

17:32.160 --> 17:33.840
Only Cowboy and Curtis with K's.

17:33.840 --> 17:35.360
Mm-hmm.

17:35.360 --> 17:36.800
He's a real talent.

17:36.800 --> 17:41.840
He could give another DJ, insert another DJ name here, a run for his money.

17:44.160 --> 17:44.880
Tiesto?

17:44.880 --> 17:45.760
He could give Tiesto?

17:45.760 --> 17:48.240
Tiesto is an agent.

17:48.240 --> 17:49.200
Tiesto is an agent.

17:49.200 --> 17:50.880
So he does not count.

17:50.880 --> 17:52.240
That would explain so many things.

17:52.240 --> 17:54.800
Like, you've never listened to speed rail and been like,

17:54.800 --> 17:56.400
oh, these beats are impossible.

17:56.960 --> 17:59.440
Nobody can make these beats unless they're computer programmed.

17:59.440 --> 18:06.160
Do you think that this guy, like, this is the question that starts every conversation

18:06.160 --> 18:07.200
he has with new people?

18:07.200 --> 18:08.560
Like, hi, nice to meet you.

18:08.560 --> 18:09.520
Oh, you're a vegetarian.

18:09.520 --> 18:10.480
That's great.

18:10.480 --> 18:12.320
Do you think that the matrix is real?

18:13.200 --> 18:14.720
Are you really a vegetarian?

18:14.720 --> 18:19.520
Or is that a choice that our computer overlords decided for you?

18:19.520 --> 18:21.520
Do they switch a bit of code in there?

18:21.520 --> 18:24.800
They switch you to a vegetarian because they knew I would be more sexually attracted to you.

18:26.800 --> 18:28.080
Thanks, overlords.

18:28.080 --> 18:30.080
Do you guys ever see, like, déjà vu?

18:30.080 --> 18:30.960
And you're like, maybe.

18:31.600 --> 18:32.240
Maybe.

18:32.240 --> 18:32.720
I don't know.

18:33.840 --> 18:34.880
I can't explain it.

18:34.880 --> 18:35.760
You know who can?

18:35.760 --> 18:36.320
Fishburne.

18:37.280 --> 18:39.520
Here's what I know, that if Fishburne's gonna come for somebody,

18:39.520 --> 18:41.440
he's gonna come for somebody with an open mind.

18:41.440 --> 18:42.640
I want that to be me.

18:42.640 --> 18:46.480
If we are in the matrix, which I have, over the span of this conversation,

18:46.480 --> 18:49.680
convinced myself that we are, in fact, in the matrix.

18:49.680 --> 18:51.040
Because you can't prove we aren't.

18:51.040 --> 18:52.240
Can't prove we aren't.

18:52.240 --> 18:54.560
It's kind of like religion.

18:54.560 --> 18:57.200
Uh, if you doubt it, that's just the devil.

18:57.200 --> 19:02.240
In our case, uh, it's Joe Paglioni trying to convince you.

19:03.120 --> 19:04.160
Joey Pants.

19:04.160 --> 19:08.720
Joey Pants, as I call- as I and other members of the Italian community call him Joey Pants,

19:10.720 --> 19:11.840
trying to convince you otherwise.

19:13.360 --> 19:14.480
He's the devil.

19:14.480 --> 19:15.760
He'd be a good devil.

19:15.760 --> 19:16.480
Yeah, he would.

19:16.480 --> 19:17.360
Let's make that happen.

19:18.000 --> 19:18.960
You know who we- can we-

19:18.960 --> 19:20.160
You're welcome, Hollywood.

19:20.160 --> 19:22.400
Can we call up the Wachowski brothers and be like,

19:22.400 --> 19:25.280
like, hey guys, like, isn't-

19:25.280 --> 19:26.800
Quit keeping us in suspense.

19:26.800 --> 19:28.880
Like, is this a documentary or not?

19:30.960 --> 19:32.560
Was this shot on location?

19:32.560 --> 19:34.320
Or is it a location in your own imaginations?

19:34.320 --> 19:35.280
Your infernal minds.

19:35.280 --> 19:37.920
Does- does anyone have a beat on Keanu?

19:39.440 --> 19:43.440
Does anyone have his- his- his manager's, uh, info to get us around?

19:43.440 --> 19:48.480
If you've got his AOL screen name, can you just, like, forward that to me at our Bim Bam account?

19:48.480 --> 19:51.040
Um, we'll just get up with him-

19:51.040 --> 19:53.120
because I think he would know what he'd tell us, though.

19:53.120 --> 19:58.400
I think we would say, hey Keanu, um, I tried to shorten his name.

19:58.400 --> 20:00.320
Which is his Hawaiian name.

20:00.320 --> 20:05.520
Hey, um, hey Keanu, uh, what- what do you know?

20:05.520 --> 20:07.120
Why don't you tell us?

20:07.120 --> 20:09.680
And he's gonna look at us with kind of a knowing smile and be like,

20:09.680 --> 20:16.880
sorry guys, like, uh, can't- can't say or else I'll get unplugged and then he'll wink at us.

20:16.880 --> 20:20.800
And then we'll say Keanu no really fucking,

20:20.800 --> 20:22.880
like, I gotta know, it keeps me up at night.

20:22.880 --> 20:25.280
And he'll say, yes, it's real.

20:25.280 --> 20:28.640
And then, like, he'll stand up really rigidly and he'll be like, not like this.

20:28.640 --> 20:29.760
And he'll fall every day.

20:31.520 --> 20:35.840
Hey, Wachowski brothers, I just wrote Matrix 4 for you, you ungrateful fucks.

20:35.840 --> 20:37.360
Did you read TMZ today?

20:37.360 --> 20:40.480
It was really- there's a crazy story about Keanu dying.

20:41.040 --> 20:44.160
Apparently Griffin killed him by making him admit the Matrix is real.

20:44.720 --> 20:45.920
We got him plugged.

20:45.920 --> 20:47.120
It was brutal.

20:47.120 --> 20:49.120
It was really brutal, but now we all know.

20:49.120 --> 20:50.880
So we're going to start the rebellion.

20:50.880 --> 20:51.760
Sacrificial lamb.

20:51.760 --> 20:54.000
I just want to party in Zion.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.240
Griffin wouldn't even do anything with the information.

20:56.240 --> 20:58.480
He'd just be like, uh, uh, and then go to Chipotle.

21:00.480 --> 21:02.160
He doesn't give a shit.

21:02.160 --> 21:04.880
This burrito tastes so much better now that Keanu's dead.

21:07.440 --> 21:10.240
I feel so much more alive because I outlived Keanu.

21:11.520 --> 21:12.720
I don't care if I am a battery.

21:12.720 --> 21:14.480
This burrito is delish.

21:14.480 --> 21:15.280
Delicious.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.720
I don't need to know that the computer program tells me it's delicious.

21:18.720 --> 21:20.400
I'm just happy to have that in my heart somewhere.

21:20.400 --> 21:22.480
There are some extra ones and zeros in this burrito.

21:23.280 --> 21:24.160
Is that picante?

21:25.520 --> 21:28.880
Can I have some extra data, please, on my, on my, uh, burrito?

21:28.880 --> 21:32.480
Let me get like 400 megabits of Chipotle's salsa sauce.

21:33.120 --> 21:34.480
There's only four megabytes left.

21:34.480 --> 21:35.200
You better take them.

21:35.200 --> 21:37.040
Om nom nom nom nom.

21:37.040 --> 21:42.960
Hey brothers, recently a girl I knew back in middle school asked me on Facebook and

21:42.960 --> 21:46.720
invited me to her small birthday gathering she's having this weekend in which there'll

21:46.720 --> 21:47.920
be a bunch of people.

21:47.920 --> 21:51.200
I haven't seen since we were kids and probably are more accomplished with their lives than

21:51.200 --> 21:51.920
me.

21:51.920 --> 21:55.200
Should I make up some awesome backstory of what I've been doing all these years?

21:56.240 --> 21:56.720
Neal.

21:58.160 --> 21:59.600
That's how I imagine he says his name.

22:01.920 --> 22:02.400
Neal.

22:03.120 --> 22:03.440
Neal.

22:04.400 --> 22:05.280
Neal.

22:05.280 --> 22:08.560
Just, just be Neal.

22:08.560 --> 22:10.080
Be the best Neal you can be.

22:10.720 --> 22:13.360
What if you, what if you show up to the party and people say, what do you do now?

22:13.360 --> 22:14.560
You say, I'm Neal.

22:14.560 --> 22:17.680
Like, they should get like, hi, look at me.

22:18.880 --> 22:19.920
It's me, Neal.

22:19.920 --> 22:21.040
I'm Neal, you know, from-

22:22.080 --> 22:23.600
Of Neal fame.

22:23.600 --> 22:26.880
My job is to be Neal and I'm always employee of the month.

22:26.880 --> 22:27.120
Yeah.

22:30.240 --> 22:32.800
It doesn't pay, it pays terribly.

22:32.800 --> 22:35.440
The pay is gone, benefits are non-existent.

22:35.440 --> 22:41.280
Uh, there is not a lot of, not a lot of responsibility, not a lot of upward mobility either.

22:41.280 --> 22:43.280
Once you're Neal, you're pretty much just Neal.

22:43.280 --> 22:43.920
For life.

22:43.920 --> 22:46.480
But also, the chances of getting fired are pretty slim.

22:47.040 --> 22:47.920
Did you hear the news?

22:48.480 --> 22:49.200
Caught laid off.

22:50.720 --> 22:52.240
Caught laid off from Neal this week.

22:54.080 --> 22:55.680
Guess it's back to Kevin.

22:55.680 --> 22:56.720
They caught me stealing.

22:57.840 --> 22:59.200
A shop lesson from Neal.

23:00.240 --> 23:01.440
Caught me stealing from Neal.

23:02.560 --> 23:03.920
It's a sexual abuse scandal.

23:03.920 --> 23:06.960
My mom caught me in my bedroom watching Baywatch.

23:06.960 --> 23:07.840
It's pretty messed up.

23:08.640 --> 23:10.640
Ah, Neal, listen man.

23:10.640 --> 23:13.760
You, you don't know those motherfuckers anything.

23:13.760 --> 23:15.840
120 years from now, we're all worm food.

23:15.840 --> 23:16.320
Fuck it.

23:16.320 --> 23:17.440
They're no better than you are.

23:18.000 --> 23:18.960
120?

23:18.960 --> 23:20.800
That's your estimate?

23:20.800 --> 23:22.800
Well, I don't know who's gonna be at this party.

23:22.800 --> 23:24.400
There might be some cyborgs there.

23:24.400 --> 23:27.360
Who, of course, their machinations cannot exist for long.

23:27.360 --> 23:29.600
Well, you're assuming that Neal is zero years old.

23:31.040 --> 23:33.920
Actually, you're assuming he's like negative 30 years old.

23:33.920 --> 23:34.160
Yeah.

23:34.720 --> 23:37.120
Listen, I don't want to bum Neal out by giving him like-

23:37.120 --> 23:39.040
I could tell Neal exactly when he's gonna die.

23:39.040 --> 23:40.880
I don't think he wants to hear that I'm a bim bam.

23:40.880 --> 23:41.360
That's true.

23:41.360 --> 23:45.200
Yeah, but don't, don't lie because that's a-

23:45.200 --> 23:47.920
There's no way that's not going to turn into a fiasco.

23:47.920 --> 23:48.480
Yeah.

23:48.480 --> 23:51.440
No, I think the better option is to honestly tell them

23:52.240 --> 23:54.240
what you are honestly doing in your life,

23:54.800 --> 23:57.360
but with such conviction and dedication

23:57.360 --> 23:59.440
that makes it sound like you're super proud of it.

23:59.440 --> 24:00.960
It's all about the perception.

24:00.960 --> 24:06.000
I wish he told us what it is he's doing because I can spin anything.

24:06.000 --> 24:09.040
Well, if he- okay, so say he's living in his mom's basement.

24:10.800 --> 24:12.320
I'm saving up for a house.

24:12.320 --> 24:12.800
Okay, great.

24:13.600 --> 24:14.720
He's working at Arby's.

24:15.280 --> 24:15.920
What?

24:15.920 --> 24:19.440
Working at Arby's and working on an expose about the fast food industry?

24:19.440 --> 24:21.440
I'm a beef specialist.

24:23.840 --> 24:25.520
That one I think would get him less traction.

24:25.520 --> 24:27.440
I'm an artisanal beef shaver.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.840
No matter what job you're doing right now,

24:33.840 --> 24:37.040
you can always spin it as research for a role.

24:37.600 --> 24:37.760
Yeah.

24:37.760 --> 24:41.040
I'm researching for a role at Arby's employee.

24:41.040 --> 24:44.560
I'm in the new Michael Cera picture and I'm an Arby's employee,

24:44.560 --> 24:47.520
so I'm hoping to get the part in the new Michael Cera.

24:47.520 --> 24:50.720
I'm hoping Michael Cera makes a movie about Arby's employees.

24:50.720 --> 24:54.720
It's called Squash the Beef and it's coming out in the summer of 2012.

24:54.720 --> 24:56.000
It co-stars Megan Fox.

24:56.000 --> 24:57.680
What a talented young lady.

24:57.680 --> 24:59.040
Danny Trejo is in it.

24:59.040 --> 25:00.720
He's a, he's a rugged gentleman.

25:00.720 --> 25:04.480
He's all heart though.

25:05.760 --> 25:09.040
Scraggy and leathery on the outside, but inside he's like gooey center.

25:09.040 --> 25:12.320
That's a hard casing for a sensitive heart.

25:12.320 --> 25:12.800
Exactly.

25:15.280 --> 25:19.280
I think be you because otherwise you are going to get caught

25:19.280 --> 25:20.960
because you are going to be like,

25:20.960 --> 25:26.640
oh, I run a gym and someone else can be like,

25:26.640 --> 25:27.520
I also run a gym.

25:27.520 --> 25:28.480
What's your gym called?

25:28.480 --> 25:29.200
And you're fucked.

25:29.200 --> 25:33.040
And you'd be like, oh, I meant J-I, I meant J-I-M.

25:33.040 --> 25:36.400
I run, I run a man named Jim is my job.

25:37.680 --> 25:38.560
I'm Jim.

25:38.560 --> 25:39.920
I'm in charge of him.

25:39.920 --> 25:40.880
My name is Jim.

25:40.880 --> 25:41.840
Let's be honest, Neal.

25:41.840 --> 25:44.640
If you're really sharp at thinking on your feet,

25:44.640 --> 25:47.200
you would probably be in a better position than you are right now.

25:47.200 --> 25:51.440
Today is not the day to try and reinvent yourself as upwardly mobile dude.

25:51.440 --> 25:55.360
Let's back up though because something even weirder

25:55.360 --> 25:58.160
than your job status is happening.

25:58.160 --> 26:00.640
And that is that a girl you knew back in middle school

26:00.640 --> 26:04.240
added you on Facebook and invited you to her birthday party.

26:04.240 --> 26:06.080
Like, hey, Neal, this is Susan.

26:06.080 --> 26:06.800
Remember me?

26:06.800 --> 26:08.400
You absolutely can't.

26:08.400 --> 26:09.520
Like, there's no way.

26:09.520 --> 26:11.440
But do you want to come chill at my birthday party?

26:11.440 --> 26:12.800
I think it's a small gathering.

26:12.800 --> 26:14.640
It's only like eight people and you.

26:14.640 --> 26:14.880
Yeah.

26:14.880 --> 26:15.520
Oh, shit.

26:15.520 --> 26:17.360
Neal, you're about to get carried.

26:17.360 --> 26:17.920
Oh, God.

26:17.920 --> 26:19.680
Neal, Neal, get out of there.

26:19.680 --> 26:20.560
Neal, come back.

26:20.560 --> 26:22.880
You're walking into a carry situation.

26:22.880 --> 26:23.920
You got to get out.

26:23.920 --> 26:28.320
Is he about to get carried or is he about to get poked?

26:30.080 --> 26:32.160
I'm saying someone found him on Facebook.

26:32.160 --> 26:33.040
They were hunting.

26:33.040 --> 26:35.440
They were trawling for Poon.

26:35.440 --> 26:36.480
Hungry for Neal.

26:36.480 --> 26:37.280
For man Poon.

26:38.000 --> 26:43.040
So you think that this is like a small birthday party slash eyes wide shut kind of deal?

26:43.040 --> 26:45.840
Oh, this has to be a sex party.

26:46.480 --> 26:47.200
Okay.

26:47.200 --> 26:47.920
Gots to be.

26:47.920 --> 26:48.800
No way it's not.

26:49.440 --> 26:50.320
It's not?

26:50.320 --> 26:51.840
And there's no way it's not.

26:51.840 --> 26:52.880
I'm saying it's 100%.

26:52.880 --> 26:57.440
Oh, you're saying there's no way this isn't a sex party.

26:57.440 --> 27:01.600
In fact, Neal, just roll up assuming it is, no matter what anyone says, because they might

27:01.600 --> 27:03.440
be like putting on pretenses at first.

27:04.000 --> 27:04.240
Yeah.

27:04.240 --> 27:06.800
Just roll up and be like, so are we starting this sex party or what?

27:06.800 --> 27:13.200
Yeah, if you're jobless or if you work at Arby's, which is pretty much the same thing.

27:13.200 --> 27:14.480
Sorry, Arby's employees.

27:17.200 --> 27:19.840
You got to assert yourself as king of this sex.

27:19.840 --> 27:20.480
I am.

27:20.480 --> 27:22.000
I'm a king of this sex party.

27:22.000 --> 27:27.360
And the way you do that is on the porch, you bring the doorbell to enter into the house

27:27.360 --> 27:28.640
for the parties being held.

27:28.640 --> 27:30.160
You go ahead and get your dick out.

27:30.160 --> 27:33.600
And you go ahead and go, I'm a king of this sex party.

27:33.600 --> 27:37.360
So when they open the door, everyone knows what is up.

27:37.360 --> 27:37.920
Who is this?

27:37.920 --> 27:38.720
I think.

27:38.720 --> 27:39.440
Is that Neal?

27:39.440 --> 27:40.800
I remember him from middle school.

27:40.800 --> 27:42.720
I don't remember him being quite so aggressive.

27:44.640 --> 27:47.200
I think rolling up with your dick out is good.

27:47.200 --> 27:48.240
It's predictable, though.

27:48.240 --> 27:52.240
I'd put, I'd just scoot your balls through the hole of your Levi's.

27:52.240 --> 27:54.160
Just scoot those out.

27:54.160 --> 27:58.800
Don't like, now you can turn this into sort of a hilarious something about Mary situation

27:58.800 --> 28:00.080
and try to dip your balls into it.

28:00.080 --> 28:02.240
But that's not how you become king of the sex party.

28:02.240 --> 28:03.920
That's how you go to the emergency room.

28:03.920 --> 28:04.640
You don't want to do that.

28:04.640 --> 28:06.880
What about mangina and cape?

28:06.880 --> 28:07.380
Hold on.

28:08.000 --> 28:08.500
What?

28:09.120 --> 28:09.620
What?

28:10.400 --> 28:12.480
Yeah, if he does mangina and wears the cape.

28:12.480 --> 28:17.120
That's how you don't do, how does, how is that an active verb, sir?

28:20.320 --> 28:21.760
You do a mangina.

28:21.760 --> 28:23.520
That's how you become king of prison.

28:26.880 --> 28:28.080
Can I ask you guys something?

28:28.080 --> 28:31.600
This is a different approach to this.

28:31.600 --> 28:36.800
Could all of his problems be corrected if he introduced himself at the party as electric

28:36.800 --> 28:37.300
Neal?

28:37.920 --> 28:41.200
Would that be, could that like fix pretty much everything?

28:41.200 --> 28:44.080
He would have to have some sort of touchdown dance that he could do.

28:45.920 --> 28:49.120
Oh, and the best part about that is after a couple of years and he's gone through some

28:49.120 --> 28:53.200
shit and he's reevaluating his life, he can come back and tell him he's now acoustic Neal.

29:00.000 --> 29:01.040
I'm 28.

29:02.000 --> 29:06.400
He's 36 and we've been living together for seven months.

29:06.400 --> 29:07.120
That's a good lead.

29:08.160 --> 29:08.660
Yeah.

29:09.120 --> 29:09.680
I like this.

29:09.680 --> 29:11.280
This is right into the meat of the question.

29:11.280 --> 29:13.200
I can, I can piece the other stuff together.

29:14.320 --> 29:20.000
I chose choose to sleep naked because I don't like the restrictive feeling of clothes while

29:20.000 --> 29:20.720
I sleep.

29:20.720 --> 29:24.080
He chooses to sleep in shorts and t-shirts.

29:24.720 --> 29:28.560
I disrobe right before crawling into bed at night and then walk directly into the bathroom

29:28.560 --> 29:29.360
in the morning.

29:29.360 --> 29:32.640
The problem is I think he is too used to seeing me naked.

29:32.640 --> 29:34.320
Our sex life has slightly declined.

29:34.320 --> 29:36.880
Seducing him doesn't work like I used to.

29:36.880 --> 29:39.760
And I get the overall feeling that he's less excited to see my body.

29:40.480 --> 29:43.280
I wonder if sleeping naked has affected this.

29:43.280 --> 29:48.640
If this is true and I have exposed myself too much, is there anything I can do or is

29:48.640 --> 29:50.160
it all downhill from here?

29:50.160 --> 29:52.480
Bear or not to bear?

29:53.760 --> 29:54.720
To bear or not to bear?

29:55.360 --> 29:56.320
Well, great.

29:56.320 --> 29:58.640
Now I have to do the show with a boner.

29:59.840 --> 30:00.640
No, I don't.

30:00.640 --> 30:01.760
I'm just kidding.

30:01.760 --> 30:03.120
I don't really have a boner.

30:03.120 --> 30:07.040
I'm only thinking all the blood is in my comedy gland.

30:07.040 --> 30:08.560
I can't think about sex right now.

30:08.560 --> 30:09.840
It's in your advice lobe.

30:10.880 --> 30:12.880
It's in my hypololimus.

30:12.880 --> 30:14.000
It's in my Lisa lobe.

30:16.800 --> 30:18.800
I sent Lisa Loeb a package of my blood.

30:25.040 --> 30:27.920
I think there's a picture of a cardboard box leaking.

30:29.280 --> 30:30.400
What is this?

30:30.400 --> 30:31.440
Hey, Lisa.

30:31.440 --> 30:32.080
Hey, Lisa.

30:32.080 --> 30:35.120
Hey, someone just dropped a package for you while you were gone.

30:36.160 --> 30:37.360
It's leaking blood.

30:37.920 --> 30:39.280
What appears to be blood.

30:40.640 --> 30:42.480
Is it from Griffin McElroy?

30:42.480 --> 30:43.520
Yeah, it is.

30:43.520 --> 30:46.000
Yeah, it smells like CK1.

30:47.920 --> 30:49.520
What an odd package this is.

30:51.920 --> 30:54.720
I think that yeah, you are right.

30:54.720 --> 31:00.400
But the good thing about it is I think that yeah, that a guy can get conditioned to seeing

31:00.400 --> 31:02.240
anybody naked.

31:02.240 --> 31:10.080
I think that the good news is men are fundamentally machines basically, and you can roll this

31:10.080 --> 31:11.200
back up really quick.

31:11.200 --> 31:11.920
Oh my God.

31:11.920 --> 31:15.920
If you, tonight, if you put his shirt on when you go to bed tonight and get in bed with

31:15.920 --> 31:17.200
him, he'll be like, where did they go?

31:18.080 --> 31:19.040
Where did it happen?

31:21.280 --> 31:22.560
Tracey, wake up.

31:23.280 --> 31:23.920
They're gone.

31:23.920 --> 31:30.240
And he'll wake up the next morning like, I thought it was a dream.

31:32.400 --> 31:34.640
I'm living a nightmare, Tracey.

31:34.640 --> 31:36.560
Yeah, it's literally like a day and you're back.

31:37.120 --> 31:41.520
And never underestimate the power of lingerie because if he's gotten conditioned to seeing

31:41.520 --> 31:43.040
you, Travis.

31:43.040 --> 31:43.280
What?

31:43.280 --> 31:48.480
No, I'm saying, I'm saying if he's gotten conditioned and used to seeing her naked.

31:48.480 --> 31:53.920
You're taking this to a much, this is far too, too personal.

31:53.920 --> 31:54.720
This place you're at.

31:54.720 --> 31:57.360
Cover your boobies in silk and lace.

31:57.360 --> 31:58.960
Like, no, gross.

31:58.960 --> 32:00.080
Fringe him out a little.

32:01.120 --> 32:04.800
Wrap your, wrap your butt in candy and stuff.

32:06.080 --> 32:09.040
This isn't pimp my girlfriend who I'm tired of seeing naked.

32:09.600 --> 32:13.120
This is my brother, my brother made advice and not creepiness.

32:13.120 --> 32:14.320
Although some creepiness.

32:14.320 --> 32:16.320
Cheap and practical solutions.

32:16.320 --> 32:18.560
And the best that means put on a big T-shirt.

32:18.560 --> 32:20.560
Put on a big T-shirt, you goof.

32:20.560 --> 32:21.600
Yeah, literally.

32:21.600 --> 32:24.320
I mean, it's like Griffin's right.

32:24.320 --> 32:25.120
Like overnight.

32:25.120 --> 32:29.040
I mean, it'll, it might take, if you've been sleeping naked for a long time, take a week

32:29.040 --> 32:30.400
to course correct yourself.

32:30.400 --> 32:32.320
Don't let him see naked at all.

32:32.320 --> 32:33.280
Ever again.

32:33.280 --> 32:34.400
Ever, ever again.

32:34.400 --> 32:37.040
This is evil.

32:37.040 --> 32:41.440
No, like keep it, keep it under wraps for a while and maybe, oh, this is good.

32:41.440 --> 32:43.680
Do something different up in there.

32:43.680 --> 32:44.560
Like lingerie.

32:44.560 --> 32:51.040
No, I mean like something underneath your, like maybe get something pierced, get some

32:51.040 --> 32:56.160
ink or maybe don't do anything to say you did something and say, you wouldn't believe

32:56.160 --> 32:57.120
what's under here now.

32:57.120 --> 33:00.000
Like he would just freak out if you could see it, but you can't see it.

33:00.000 --> 33:01.600
Dave Coulier right on my gut.

33:02.160 --> 33:04.720
It's so weird in here and you can't see it anymore.

33:04.720 --> 33:06.960
And it's so weird if you need to see it.

33:06.960 --> 33:08.320
Cause then he'll be crazy.

33:08.320 --> 33:12.800
Like if you start teasing, now you got to deliver, you know, it can't be like Al Capone's

33:12.800 --> 33:16.560
vault where Geraldo just teases and teases and teases, there's nothing in it.

33:16.560 --> 33:19.920
You got to have some, you got to deliver something even if it's like a henna tattoo.

33:19.920 --> 33:21.120
Or Dave Coulier.

33:21.120 --> 33:21.760
Al Capone.

33:22.560 --> 33:24.240
Or Al Capone.

33:24.240 --> 33:27.200
Can you get Al Capone like on your torso somewhere?

33:27.200 --> 33:29.600
In it on it somewhere around.

33:29.600 --> 33:31.520
A tattoo or like the real Al Capone?

33:32.240 --> 33:32.720
Yeah.

33:32.720 --> 33:33.440
Like him.

33:33.440 --> 33:34.000
Like the man.

33:36.000 --> 33:39.840
Also start referring to your lady business as Al Capone's vault.

33:39.840 --> 33:41.120
Just see how that takes out.

33:41.120 --> 33:46.560
Uh, side note, uh, talking to a dear friend of mine today, his father's a teacher and

33:46.560 --> 33:49.520
one of the students in his class is named D'Al Capone Jones.

33:52.400 --> 33:53.200
This is not a joke.

33:53.200 --> 33:54.000
It's awesome.

33:54.000 --> 33:55.280
This is not a gag I made up.

33:55.280 --> 33:56.000
Fuck that's good.

33:56.000 --> 33:57.200
D'Al Capone Jones.

33:59.200 --> 34:00.560
Speaking of Al Capone.

34:00.560 --> 34:01.280
You want a yahoo?

34:02.240 --> 34:03.520
Yeah, I do.

34:03.520 --> 34:05.360
This one was sent in by Chuck Jones.

34:05.360 --> 34:06.400
Thanks Chuck Jones.

34:06.400 --> 34:08.240
It's by yahoo answers user Patrick.

34:08.240 --> 34:09.120
That's weird.

34:09.120 --> 34:09.680
Two Pat's.

34:09.680 --> 34:11.760
Um, Patrick asks.

34:13.200 --> 34:15.200
Questions for my dental hygienist.

34:17.200 --> 34:21.680
I am going to be getting my teeth cleaned soon by my ridiculously hot dental hygienist.

34:21.680 --> 34:23.040
And I want to ask some things.

34:23.600 --> 34:27.200
Um, if you were asked these questions, what would your answer be?

34:27.200 --> 34:28.720
And how do you think she will react?

34:30.560 --> 34:30.880
One.

34:30.880 --> 34:33.840
You want to just ask out to do we want to role play here?

34:33.840 --> 34:34.960
Um, sure, sure.

34:34.960 --> 34:39.360
Yeah, you guys can take turns being the super just banging dental hygienist.

34:39.360 --> 34:41.040
And I'll be the sounds like me.

34:41.040 --> 34:42.080
I'll be Patrick.

34:42.080 --> 34:42.560
Uh, one.

34:43.680 --> 34:46.880
Can I have the pair of gloves and the mask you used on me?

34:48.640 --> 34:51.440
I was going to do a bit, but I think she would probably just leave the room.

34:51.440 --> 34:52.720
Yeah, that was my reaction.

34:54.320 --> 34:56.640
I was buying into the character saying yes to the moment.

34:56.640 --> 34:58.560
And that is what my character would have done.

34:58.560 --> 35:02.640
Does the general, does the dental hygienist have a button underneath the counter that

35:02.640 --> 35:04.160
like summons the police?

35:04.160 --> 35:05.120
That's what I would be doing.

35:05.120 --> 35:06.080
Yeah, she does.

35:06.080 --> 35:08.160
Now she will after this.

35:08.160 --> 35:12.160
Um, two, can I have a pair of new gloves and what kind of gloves are they?

35:12.160 --> 35:13.360
That one's kind of harmless.

35:14.000 --> 35:17.040
Uh, yeah, unless unless you couple it with the first question.

35:17.600 --> 35:18.000
Yeah.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.400
And then you say I just need to hide my fingerprints.

35:20.960 --> 35:22.320
I can't tell you why.

35:22.320 --> 35:23.360
No, it's it's it's fine.

35:24.160 --> 35:28.480
Three, would you please check in the back to see if you have any pink gloves or mask

35:28.480 --> 35:29.040
you could use?

35:30.880 --> 35:32.560
What's this guy's hang up?

35:32.560 --> 35:36.480
Oh, four, four.

35:36.480 --> 35:39.120
Do you have to wear a mask?

35:39.120 --> 35:39.680
What?

35:39.680 --> 35:42.720
Can you just spit in my mouth while you're cleaning it?

35:42.720 --> 35:47.280
Five, will you surprise me with the profy paste flavor?

35:47.280 --> 35:48.160
I don't know what that means.

35:49.040 --> 35:49.840
What?

35:49.840 --> 35:51.120
Profy, profy.

35:51.760 --> 35:54.800
This guy doesn't have a crush on his dental hygienist.

35:54.800 --> 35:56.400
He has a dentistry fetish.

35:57.280 --> 35:58.480
That's what's going on here.

35:58.480 --> 36:04.000
And not only that, but like these aren't even like, these are the least direct yet still

36:04.000 --> 36:05.600
creepy questions I've ever had.

36:05.600 --> 36:09.600
Really, Travis, because number six, instead of using a mirror to hold back my cheek, will

36:09.600 --> 36:10.640
you use your finger?

36:14.640 --> 36:15.120
Yes.

36:15.120 --> 36:19.280
Seven, will you perform an extra intra oral and TMJ exam?

36:19.840 --> 36:20.800
Really get in there.

36:21.600 --> 36:22.800
Just get deep in there.

36:23.840 --> 36:24.560
Is there?

36:24.560 --> 36:24.960
Is there?

36:24.960 --> 36:26.000
OK, are there more questions?

36:26.880 --> 36:29.200
Will you use a toothbrush instead of the polisher?

36:29.760 --> 36:31.360
That's not particularly sexual.

36:31.360 --> 36:33.520
Nine, can I add you on Facebook?

36:34.080 --> 36:35.120
Oh, there it is.

36:35.120 --> 36:38.560
Dr. Woodruff, can I add you on Facebook?

36:39.760 --> 36:41.040
That's the end of it right there.

36:41.040 --> 36:42.160
Can I Facebook you?

36:42.160 --> 36:45.200
OK, here's what I would like to pause it.

36:45.200 --> 36:49.760
I think there is an order in which you can ask these questions where you could get to

36:49.760 --> 36:52.320
the end of them without the person leaving the room.

36:52.320 --> 36:54.880
Is there an order in which you could drop these beats?

36:54.880 --> 36:55.680
You got to leave.

36:55.680 --> 36:57.520
You got to lead with Facebook, I think.

36:57.520 --> 36:59.200
It's like making a mixtape, right?

36:59.200 --> 37:03.120
Like you got to, you got to peek it back off, peek it back off.

37:03.120 --> 37:05.600
Like, I think you need to mix up the really weird one.

37:05.600 --> 37:06.240
Dude, I don't know.

37:06.240 --> 37:09.600
I think once you hit, just use your finger.

37:10.480 --> 37:11.600
Get in there with your digits.

37:12.800 --> 37:14.000
You could play that off there.

37:14.000 --> 37:15.680
Like, I have a mirror allergy.

37:15.680 --> 37:17.120
I have an allergy to silver.

37:17.120 --> 37:19.040
Reflective surfaces, ew.

37:19.040 --> 37:20.400
Just get in there with your dig.

37:22.320 --> 37:28.480
Hey, hey, when vampires go to the dentist, how do the doctors see their back teeth?

37:28.480 --> 37:29.360
Oh, it's so hard.

37:29.360 --> 37:30.800
That's a good question.

37:30.800 --> 37:36.400
And, and I mean, dental care is so important to a vampire for obvious reasons.

37:36.960 --> 37:39.120
They've got those teeth forever.

37:39.120 --> 37:41.600
Especially with the sugar filled diet of the American public.

37:41.600 --> 37:46.240
I mean, you can't, yeah, you can't eat a fat person without getting a calorie or a cavity.

37:48.080 --> 37:56.160
How do you get a modicum of a boner when you're in a dentist chair?

37:56.160 --> 38:01.840
How do you get, how do you focus on anything but the raw primal fear of somebody getting

38:01.840 --> 38:04.960
in your teeth and just clanging around in there with their digits?

38:06.240 --> 38:08.960
Like some sort of, like some sort of bad mechanic.

38:08.960 --> 38:10.000
Just tune me up.

38:10.000 --> 38:11.040
Turn up your grill.

38:11.040 --> 38:18.880
I don't think, like, I don't think I will ever be too old to not be scared fuckless

38:18.880 --> 38:19.840
of the dentist.

38:19.840 --> 38:21.040
Like, can't handle it.

38:21.040 --> 38:24.160
Well, that is, that's because it's the most terrifying thing.

38:24.160 --> 38:25.360
It's like the most terrifying thing.

38:25.360 --> 38:26.240
I don't like, I don't like eating food.

38:26.240 --> 38:31.680
Someone is putting whirring, like, blades and points into your mouth and you can't see

38:31.680 --> 38:32.640
what they're doing in there.

38:32.640 --> 38:34.960
You are fighting instinct at every turn.

38:35.600 --> 38:37.760
Maybe that's sexual for some people.

38:37.760 --> 38:42.560
Like, trying to clang, clamp down on, like, their better impulses.

38:42.560 --> 38:46.480
All it takes is one Dr. Butterfingers and he's got a drill through your tongue.

38:46.480 --> 38:47.040
Yeah.

38:47.040 --> 38:47.600
Why?

38:47.600 --> 38:49.840
Yeah, but like, that's hot for some people.

38:49.840 --> 38:50.800
They love the danger.

38:51.600 --> 38:52.640
They love the excitement.

38:53.520 --> 38:54.000
The thrill, I guess?

38:54.000 --> 38:55.200
What's gonna happen today at the dentist?

38:55.200 --> 38:55.600
I don't know.

38:56.560 --> 38:57.280
I might die.

38:58.000 --> 38:58.880
I might die.

38:58.880 --> 39:00.400
I might die.

39:00.400 --> 39:01.920
I will get a boner.

39:01.920 --> 39:03.600
That's for sure.

39:03.600 --> 39:08.960
I will get arrested because I am gonna go full on creepster on my-

39:08.960 --> 39:12.080
Okay, here's the thing that's gonna, like, really fuck you guys up.

39:12.080 --> 39:12.400
Okay.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.240
They ask these questions on Yahoo Answers.

39:16.880 --> 39:24.240
There is 100% likelihood that this person who asked these things did sit in a dentist

39:24.240 --> 39:27.040
chair at some point after this and have an interaction.

39:27.040 --> 39:28.480
Like, this happened.

39:28.480 --> 39:30.800
Like, this isn't, like, fun theory.

39:30.800 --> 39:34.160
Like, this fucking creeper.

39:34.160 --> 39:35.440
Oh, so he was, like, planning.

39:36.640 --> 39:37.600
He did this.

39:37.600 --> 39:39.440
I mean, he did these things that he's saying to us.

39:40.240 --> 39:41.920
He may be apologizing.

39:41.920 --> 39:43.440
Like, is this-

39:43.440 --> 39:44.240
I mean, what would you do?

39:44.240 --> 39:45.120
I just did this.

39:45.120 --> 39:45.840
Is that cool?

39:45.840 --> 39:46.800
So weird.

39:46.800 --> 39:49.200
Did you pull this off of Craigslist Missed Connections?

39:49.200 --> 39:49.440
No.

39:49.440 --> 39:52.480
Me, in the dentist chair, mouth open, slightly numb.

39:52.480 --> 39:54.720
You, finger, chewing on it.

39:54.720 --> 39:56.880
Chesty, put your finger right in there.

39:56.880 --> 39:57.600
Touch my teeth.

39:57.600 --> 39:58.960
Saw down your blouse.

39:58.960 --> 39:59.680
Saw your plates out.

39:59.680 --> 40:01.360
Put that mirror away, silly.

40:01.360 --> 40:02.160
Get your fingers in there.

40:02.160 --> 40:03.600
Hey, we don't need to get mirrors in there.

40:03.600 --> 40:04.640
Just put your fingers in there.

40:05.360 --> 40:06.560
Let me kiss your eyelids.

40:08.560 --> 40:14.000
In case anybody out there is wondering, of all the times to try to, like, be flirty and

40:14.000 --> 40:19.680
pick someone up, when they're in there digging out your old-ass food and tartar buildup with

40:19.680 --> 40:24.480
their fingers in your gross-ass mouth as you're drooling all over yourself, probably not the

40:24.480 --> 40:24.560
best thing.

40:24.560 --> 40:26.080
Is this a piece of Mars bar?

40:26.800 --> 40:31.680
Point of order, if you're trying to fuck your dental hygienist, I bet you keep it pretty

40:31.680 --> 40:32.640
locked down up there.

40:33.760 --> 40:34.560
I bet you keep-

40:34.560 --> 40:37.440
Or, I bet you're pretty much on point in your mouth area.

40:38.000 --> 40:39.040
That's your showpiece.

40:40.240 --> 40:41.440
I just can't, like-

40:41.440 --> 40:45.840
The only thing that gives me a boner about going to the dentist is, at the end of it,

40:45.840 --> 40:47.200
I get a free toothbrush.

40:48.000 --> 40:49.440
And a prize.

40:49.440 --> 40:53.440
Like, the value of that is, like, oh, I don't take the prize anymore.

40:53.440 --> 40:53.840
I love-

40:53.840 --> 40:54.240
What?

40:54.240 --> 40:58.640
I mean, I love sticky hands, but it's a conflict of interest because I'm trying to fuck my

40:58.640 --> 41:01.600
dental hygienist and, like, if I-

41:01.600 --> 41:04.880
Can I get your number and also that pair of googly eyeglasses?

41:04.880 --> 41:08.320
Like, we settle the bill and I walk out and I turn back and come through the door.

41:08.320 --> 41:09.600
I'm like, two things.

41:09.600 --> 41:11.840
One, can I not get a date?

41:11.840 --> 41:14.400
Two, what about those sticky hands?

41:14.400 --> 41:15.200
What's up with those?

41:15.200 --> 41:18.640
Because I need one to grab things that are far away.

41:18.640 --> 41:19.920
But seriously though, date?

41:19.920 --> 41:20.960
You want to go to Sizzler?

41:20.960 --> 41:21.440
I love you.

41:22.000 --> 41:24.160
One thing is, do you want to go to Sizzler?

41:24.160 --> 41:27.040
The other is, do you have one of those foam planes that I build myself?

41:27.600 --> 41:28.960
I love those so much.

41:28.960 --> 41:30.160
I love those so much.

41:30.800 --> 41:32.640
I will take one or the other.

41:32.640 --> 41:33.520
Choice is yours.

41:35.600 --> 41:43.200
There's only one thing that I get aroused by, and that's trips to the money zone.

41:43.200 --> 42:02.800
Okay, who's taking us this week, Griffin?

42:04.320 --> 42:05.040
Okay, hold up.

42:05.040 --> 42:05.600
Time out.

42:05.600 --> 42:07.440
Why am I never invited to the money zone?

42:08.000 --> 42:09.600
Okay, Travis, tell us about-

42:09.600 --> 42:10.880
Because you make things up.

42:10.880 --> 42:11.440
You lie.

42:11.440 --> 42:14.240
You lie through the whole thing.

42:14.240 --> 42:17.920
You'll lie about the thing, and then people pay us to say the truth, and you lie about

42:17.920 --> 42:18.400
the whole thing.

42:18.400 --> 42:19.920
You just make it up.

42:19.920 --> 42:21.120
Travis, you do it.

42:21.120 --> 42:26.480
I'll be your safety net, and when you fuck up, I'll be there to catch you like your father

42:26.480 --> 42:26.880
figure.

42:27.920 --> 42:28.400
Put your little hand in mine.

42:28.400 --> 42:29.280
Lionel Richie, whatever.

42:29.280 --> 42:30.720
Now, Cole Richie goes raw.

42:30.720 --> 42:31.200
He's there.

42:32.000 --> 42:33.920
Oh God, I can't take the pressure.

42:33.920 --> 42:34.320
Do it.

42:34.320 --> 42:35.440
No, you do it.

42:35.440 --> 42:41.200
Oh, okay, well first we want to congratulate Mike on graduating from Stony Brook University.

42:41.840 --> 42:42.240
That sounds like a wizard school.

42:42.240 --> 42:43.760
Go fightin' white fish.

42:43.760 --> 42:45.440
Is that a wizard school for wizards?

42:47.440 --> 42:48.240
Wizard school.

42:48.240 --> 42:49.920
Yes, Mike has graduated-

42:51.520 --> 42:52.080
Classic.

42:54.000 --> 42:57.840
Mike graduated with a wizarding degree in computer engineering.

42:58.640 --> 43:01.040
Now, a lot of people hear that, and they say,

43:01.040 --> 43:05.840
what, that's not, and I say technomagic, is what I say to those people.

43:05.840 --> 43:06.800
Circuit spells.

43:07.600 --> 43:09.600
Yeah, techno wizards.

43:09.600 --> 43:12.560
It's all about bits and bytes and incantations.

43:12.560 --> 43:14.320
Where's he going next?

43:14.320 --> 43:20.800
Oh, he's going to be pursuing his masters at Stony Brook once more, and unfortunately

43:20.800 --> 43:26.960
his friends, Matt, Tony, Franco, and Sean, they done fucked up, and they have requested

43:26.960 --> 43:29.840
that I do the jingle this week.

43:29.840 --> 43:31.520
Oh, shit.

43:31.520 --> 43:37.280
You will also need to combo, that means you've been lumped in.

43:37.280 --> 43:39.600
Oh, by the way, Mike's nickname, the captain.

43:39.600 --> 43:40.640
I like that.

43:40.640 --> 43:41.680
I like that, too.

43:42.480 --> 43:46.640
I like any nickname that's the, unless it's the situation, but the captain is fine.

43:47.520 --> 43:52.880
Listener Jennifer Manziel writes her husband, Todd, a 40, no, it's not what writes him,

43:52.880 --> 43:57.920
wishes him a happy 40th birthday on June 29th.

43:57.920 --> 44:00.720
So just two days away.

44:00.720 --> 44:07.760
Here's what I know about Todd, rapid fire, chef, Vancouver, BC, before time he was a

44:07.760 --> 44:09.840
chef back in caveman days.

44:09.840 --> 44:17.440
We have a Boston terrier named Maude, Todd's nickname, gorilla, turning 40, did cover that.

44:17.440 --> 44:20.800
You're listening to the captain and the gorilla on 94.3.

44:21.520 --> 44:22.400
There, there's your jingle.

44:23.040 --> 44:24.560
His hair is like lambswool.

44:26.800 --> 44:27.600
Awesome.

44:27.600 --> 44:29.360
He plays World of Warcraft.

44:29.360 --> 44:33.840
That is the order in which I hope he would relate those facts to me, were I to meet Todd.

44:34.400 --> 44:36.240
Actually, that's how it's listed on his resume.

44:37.840 --> 44:39.760
Special skills, hair like lambswool.

44:40.640 --> 44:43.840
Todd, this is a really long business card, but I appreciate you giving it to me.

44:43.840 --> 44:45.280
Can I feel your hair again?

44:45.280 --> 44:47.120
So happy birthday to you, Todd.

44:47.120 --> 44:50.800
Thank you, Jennifer, for wishing Todd such a happy special day.

44:50.800 --> 44:56.720
Uh, sadly, because of the, I'm just going to say callous misjudgment of Matt, Tony,

44:56.720 --> 45:02.560
Franco, and Sean, you are going to have a jingle also sung by Travis as he sings about

45:02.560 --> 45:04.080
the captain and the gorilla.

45:04.080 --> 45:09.360
I told him to get a Casio keyboard pre-programmed with, with the backing tracks.

45:10.320 --> 45:12.480
Uh, I do not think he has taken that action.

45:12.480 --> 45:14.640
So let's see what Travis has whipped up.

45:16.640 --> 45:18.080
How are we going to, how are we going to?

45:18.080 --> 45:21.680
Here's what we're going to do, Griffin.

45:21.680 --> 45:27.840
We're going to sit here in silence as Travis sings us a song about the captain and gorilla.

45:27.840 --> 45:32.240
So you want, cause I can just do it like acapella, like arocapella.

45:32.240 --> 45:34.560
Yeah, I think you should definitely do that.

45:34.560 --> 45:37.440
I can't, like I won't be able to handle.

45:38.080 --> 45:39.920
We are going to see where this goes.

45:39.920 --> 45:40.880
Strap in.

45:40.880 --> 45:43.120
You guys got to shut up so I can pretend like you're not there.

45:43.120 --> 45:48.160
This is what it's like when Travis has sex too.

45:50.800 --> 45:51.300
Okay.

45:53.040 --> 45:53.280
Okay.

45:53.280 --> 45:54.480
So here's what I've worked up.

45:54.480 --> 45:54.980
Okay.

45:56.400 --> 45:57.120
God damn it.

45:59.520 --> 46:05.840
Captain Mike and the gorilla set their boat towards excitement and they sailed down the

46:05.840 --> 46:07.520
river of dreams.

46:07.520 --> 46:15.200
They had adventures by the score for about 20 years or more, but then everything ends

46:15.200 --> 46:18.160
or so it seems.

46:18.160 --> 46:22.480
Now they've grown up and gotten adult jobs.

46:22.480 --> 46:23.440
He's a chef.

46:23.440 --> 46:25.280
He's a technical engineer.

46:28.240 --> 46:28.720
Is that it?

46:28.720 --> 46:29.760
Stop laughing.

46:29.760 --> 46:30.320
I'm not laughing.

46:30.320 --> 46:31.200
Is that the end of the song?

46:31.920 --> 46:32.420
No.

46:33.760 --> 46:35.440
He's a technical engineer.

46:35.440 --> 46:36.240
Got that bit.

46:36.240 --> 46:37.920
Here comes the bridge.

46:37.920 --> 46:42.960
Now Captain Mike and the gorilla have given up adventure.

46:42.960 --> 46:46.240
They sold their boat and got a mortgage.

46:47.440 --> 46:48.640
Did that rhyme with engineer?

46:51.040 --> 46:53.520
Would that have rhymed if we let you sing it all together?

46:53.520 --> 46:54.640
Yes, maybe.

46:55.840 --> 46:57.040
Jesus will know if you're lying.

46:57.840 --> 47:02.640
And then pretty much the song devolves from there and then the rest of it was something

47:02.640 --> 47:04.880
about learning that the greatest adventure is life.

47:04.880 --> 47:07.040
Why are you- why didn't you sing that bit, Travis?

47:07.040 --> 47:08.800
Do you not know how the song works?

47:08.800 --> 47:10.160
Is this like an R. Kelly speech breakdown?

47:10.160 --> 47:10.960
Well now I've lost-

47:14.240 --> 47:18.320
And then after that point we basically just sing about a free bird flying.

47:18.320 --> 47:19.840
There's some more guitar noises.

47:19.840 --> 47:21.920
And then there's a pretty epic bridge.

47:23.920 --> 47:25.360
Yeah, so it's pretty much a lot of that.

47:25.360 --> 47:29.760
Say so far, say goodbye to yesterday, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

47:29.760 --> 47:30.640
And then we wrap it up.

47:31.360 --> 47:32.320
Learn a life lesson.

47:33.120 --> 47:34.160
Learn a life lesson.

47:34.160 --> 47:34.800
Explored.

47:35.840 --> 47:37.200
Yeah, so it's pretty much just like that.

47:37.200 --> 47:37.840
Like, where were you?

47:37.840 --> 47:40.480
The world stopped turning and we all think about how sad we were.

47:40.480 --> 47:42.080
And then there's some guitar.

47:42.080 --> 47:42.720
And then it's over.

47:42.720 --> 47:43.600
It's the end of the song.

47:43.600 --> 47:44.560
It's pretty good.

47:44.560 --> 47:45.120
What do you think?

47:46.320 --> 47:47.360
Thanks, Alan Jackson.

47:47.360 --> 47:48.160
That was a great performance.

47:51.680 --> 47:52.080
Hey-

47:52.080 --> 47:54.240
Yeah, now it's like an Indian outlaw.

47:54.240 --> 47:56.880
It's basically just a meditation on that for another minute and a half.

47:56.880 --> 48:00.240
I have to do the course a couple more times and have Cherokee chalk to all that stuff.

48:00.880 --> 48:02.320
There's some more vaguely racist stuff.

48:02.320 --> 48:09.280
A, B, C, C, A, A, B, C, B, B, B, C, A, D, J, A, C, C, B song pattern.

48:09.280 --> 48:09.840
So-

48:09.840 --> 48:11.520
Did you see DJ, A, C, C, B, B, B?

48:13.440 --> 48:15.600
He was at the show last week and he's amazing.

48:16.480 --> 48:17.120
Oh, fuck.

48:17.760 --> 48:18.720
It's amazing.

48:18.720 --> 48:21.760
So thank you guys for, I guess, for that.

48:21.760 --> 48:22.960
And thank you, Travis.

48:22.960 --> 48:25.280
Please never, ever make me do that again.

48:25.280 --> 48:29.840
Since splitting up with my girlfriend two years ago, I've been focusing on ruining my business-

48:29.840 --> 48:30.080
Nope.

48:30.080 --> 48:31.360
And spending- Nope.

48:31.360 --> 48:34.880
I've been focusing on running my business and spending time with friends.

48:34.880 --> 48:38.560
I'm 23 years old and I have ambitions and goals I would like to achieve.

48:39.120 --> 48:40.960
Should I be looking for a relationship?

48:40.960 --> 48:42.560
Most of my friends are engaged.

48:42.560 --> 48:46.880
Or just carry on doing me and I don't think you have much of a choice.

48:48.080 --> 48:50.800
Wait for someone to come along undecided in the UK.

48:51.920 --> 48:52.640
Oh, man.

48:52.640 --> 48:59.200
It's like this guy's me, like last year when I was 23 and running a business.

48:59.200 --> 49:01.440
Well, Griffin, how did you make this choice?

49:02.480 --> 49:10.240
Listen, I've been running my business with just full steam ahead

49:10.240 --> 49:12.960
and I don't have time to dock in the port.

49:12.960 --> 49:14.160
My business is a steamboat.

49:15.920 --> 49:17.120
Let me start over.

49:17.120 --> 49:18.080
Griffin's in the steamboat business.

49:18.080 --> 49:19.440
I'm in the steamboat industry.

49:19.440 --> 49:21.120
It's booming.

49:21.120 --> 49:28.560
And because it's a hip hop steamboat and the speakers are loud.

49:28.560 --> 49:32.480
So anyway, the stern wheels of steel is what he calls it.

49:33.280 --> 49:34.720
This primary is going to keep on rolling.

49:34.720 --> 49:41.760
And I don't have time to stop in the port of love.

49:42.880 --> 49:46.720
I don't have time to dock there because I'm too busy running my business.

49:46.720 --> 49:55.040
And there's nothing wrong with that because a steamboat in port gets loved.

49:55.040 --> 49:56.640
But that's not what a steamboat's for, is it?

49:56.640 --> 49:58.640
Uh, for love?

49:58.640 --> 49:59.920
No, no, it's nice.

49:59.920 --> 50:01.280
It's for traveling down rivers.

50:02.160 --> 50:02.800
No, yeah.

50:02.800 --> 50:09.440
Or hosting the most bangin' R&B rap and beats concerts in the eastern United States.

50:09.440 --> 50:10.160
Exactly.

50:10.160 --> 50:12.720
Listen, Undecided in the UK.

50:12.720 --> 50:17.920
We all are in the business of spinning plates.

50:17.920 --> 50:21.760
We all have different things going on.

50:21.760 --> 50:29.200
And sometimes when one plate falls off, the stick that you're spinning it on, the dowel

50:29.200 --> 50:32.800
rod that you're spinning it on, it shatters like your relationship did.

50:33.360 --> 50:36.400
It's okay to look at the other plates and be like, well, I gotta make sure these are

50:36.400 --> 50:37.520
really, really spinning.

50:38.240 --> 50:42.400
But eventually, you gotta pick that plate back up and put it back on.

50:42.400 --> 50:49.360
If I've learned anything from ABC family movies and the like, people that always just

50:49.360 --> 50:53.200
devote themselves to their job and don't spend any time with family and friends are

50:53.200 --> 50:54.560
always the happiest people.

50:55.120 --> 50:55.600
Oh, yeah?

50:55.600 --> 50:56.080
Right?

50:56.080 --> 50:59.120
They never look back on their life and regret the choices they've made.

50:59.120 --> 51:01.920
I mean, I'm fucking smiles for miles over here.

51:01.920 --> 51:05.280
Like, you don't have to, because you're spinning- let's go back to the plate spinning

51:05.280 --> 51:07.120
analogy, because I felt like it was so on the nose.

51:07.920 --> 51:12.320
Like, you're spinning that plate and it falls off, and then your chore of a girlfriend comes

51:12.320 --> 51:14.480
in and is like, why are you spinning my plates?

51:14.480 --> 51:16.000
And it's like, this is my job.

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
I'm a plate spinner.

51:18.000 --> 51:19.360
I'm focusing on this right now.

51:20.480 --> 51:22.960
Yeah, but the problem is, is you don't look back.

51:22.960 --> 51:25.600
Like, you don't turn 24 and look back on 23.

51:25.600 --> 51:29.440
You turn like 68, and you're old and alone, and then you're sad.

51:30.080 --> 51:31.840
You don't look back on 23, Travis?

51:32.960 --> 51:39.120
I think about how sweet 23 was every time I go to bed in my bed.

51:39.120 --> 51:40.640
Now you're 24, you're run down.

51:40.640 --> 51:46.720
Oh, like, I'm already like a fifth of the way through my life.

51:47.920 --> 51:48.560
Don't think about that.

51:49.200 --> 51:49.520
Whoa!

51:50.240 --> 51:50.800
Yeah?

51:50.800 --> 51:52.640
I'm going with the 120 years.

51:55.040 --> 51:56.080
You an electric Neil?

51:57.040 --> 52:04.320
I mean, every year that gets away from me is another year that I spent alone on this

52:04.320 --> 52:05.440
fucking steamboat.

52:06.080 --> 52:07.440
This steamboat sucks.

52:07.440 --> 52:10.640
I can't sleep on it, because it's just parties all the time.

52:11.440 --> 52:12.480
What was I thinking?

52:14.960 --> 52:16.880
To be fair, we tried to talk you out of it.

52:16.880 --> 52:20.000
Why did I buy this from that shady Cajun businessman?

52:22.000 --> 52:23.440
This was the worst idea.

52:23.440 --> 52:26.640
I thought it was going to be like Maverick, but it's not like Maverick.

52:26.640 --> 52:30.480
It's just shitty hip-hop parties all the time, and I can't sleep.

52:30.480 --> 52:32.240
Fuck it, and I'm so alone.

52:32.240 --> 52:33.200
Fuck you, Maverick.

52:33.200 --> 52:38.400
I thought Jodie Foster was going to come in here and jump my bones, but that's not what

52:38.400 --> 52:39.040
happened, is it?

52:40.560 --> 52:43.920
So it's less focusing on your business and more trying to get Jodie Foster to fall in

52:43.920 --> 52:44.400
love with you.

52:44.400 --> 52:47.760
By the way, a little misguided, as it turns out.

52:48.320 --> 52:50.560
A little bark up the wrong tree there.

52:50.560 --> 52:53.680
I guess undecided in the UK, what we're saying is, you want to buy a steamboat?

52:53.680 --> 52:57.120
I'll give it to you cheaper than I got it.

52:57.120 --> 53:00.080
I know a guy who will cut you a deal.

53:00.080 --> 53:01.120
Let's do a quick Yahoo.

53:02.080 --> 53:02.560
Okay.

53:02.560 --> 53:02.960
All right.

53:02.960 --> 53:03.680
Sounds good.

53:03.680 --> 53:05.360
This one was sent in by Ryan M.

53:05.360 --> 53:06.320
Thank you, Ryan.

53:06.320 --> 53:08.880
It's by Yahoo Answers user BX, who asks,

53:10.800 --> 53:16.320
Should Obama try to change his image by wearing body armor and showing the world he is ready

53:16.320 --> 53:16.880
for action?

53:18.080 --> 53:22.560
Obama just does not seem presidential enough, and his policy on troop withdrawals are making

53:22.560 --> 53:23.360
him look soft.

53:25.600 --> 53:26.320
Here's the thing.

53:27.680 --> 53:28.000
Yes.

53:29.040 --> 53:29.920
Here's what's up.

53:29.920 --> 53:36.480
I think Obama should dress up in full-blown robot armor.

53:36.480 --> 53:39.200
I think he should carry around big gun all the time.

53:39.200 --> 53:41.360
And I think, can we get a rapier?

53:41.360 --> 53:43.600
Can you carry around a rapier everywhere he goes?

53:43.600 --> 53:48.320
And like two flags sort of tucked within his back so he looks like some sort of superhero,

53:48.320 --> 53:49.840
some sort of patriotic superhero.

53:50.800 --> 53:55.280
I think he should wear a costume reminiscent of George Washington.

53:56.080 --> 53:58.240
Oh, you're saying like full-blown powdered wig.

53:58.240 --> 53:58.880
Yeah.

53:58.880 --> 53:59.440
Yeah.

53:59.440 --> 54:00.320
Peg leg.

54:00.320 --> 54:02.080
Like let's president it up, you know?

54:03.040 --> 54:06.720
So we have basically like old-timey Obama or like Psy-Bama.

54:06.720 --> 54:08.960
Psy-Bama.

54:08.960 --> 54:09.360
Techno-Bama.

54:09.360 --> 54:10.480
Okay, okay.

54:10.480 --> 54:17.760
So what about him in a George Washington costume inside of a robotic exoskeleton?

54:18.800 --> 54:20.080
Oh, I love it.

54:20.080 --> 54:21.840
Like, oh, that couldn't get any weirder.

54:21.840 --> 54:23.280
Him in an exoskeleton.

54:23.280 --> 54:24.000
It opens up.

54:25.280 --> 54:26.320
Oh, shit.

54:26.320 --> 54:28.960
He's in George Washington gear.

54:28.960 --> 54:33.120
What about instead of body armor, what about under armor?

54:33.120 --> 54:37.200
He just shows up, shows up completely flexed out.

54:37.200 --> 54:41.440
And just cuts to Obama running up and down the bleachers and he stops and goes, you know,

54:42.080 --> 54:43.040
I love Gatorade.

54:43.040 --> 54:44.640
Obama, you gotta run this country.

54:44.640 --> 54:46.000
He's like, I can't, I'm sporting.

54:46.880 --> 54:47.440
Back off.

54:47.440 --> 54:50.480
They're like, we need you to sign or veto these policies.

54:50.480 --> 54:52.640
And he's like, I can't, I gotta catch this football.

54:52.640 --> 54:53.520
Sports president.

54:54.800 --> 54:55.760
I can't run the country.

54:55.760 --> 54:57.360
I'm running these wind sprints.

54:57.360 --> 54:57.920
Here's the thing.

54:57.920 --> 55:00.240
Every president has his thing, right?

55:00.240 --> 55:01.440
Like everyone has a scene.

55:02.320 --> 55:06.000
Like Bill Clinton was the president who loved blow chops, loved getting them.

55:06.720 --> 55:07.760
And then there was-

55:07.760 --> 55:09.760
To be fair, he ran on that platform.

55:09.760 --> 55:10.160
Yeah.

55:10.160 --> 55:11.840
It's like, who's got two thumbs up?

55:11.840 --> 55:12.640
There's blow jobs.

55:12.640 --> 55:12.800
Me.

55:13.360 --> 55:13.760
I do.

55:13.760 --> 55:15.920
He ran on that platform, but not as fast as Obama.

55:16.880 --> 55:18.640
He's a sports president.

55:18.640 --> 55:19.280
Well, I don't know.

55:19.280 --> 55:19.760
That's the thing.

55:19.760 --> 55:25.680
I feel like Obama hasn't established himself as a particular, but he doesn't have a goof.

55:25.680 --> 55:26.320
He doesn't have a goof.

55:26.320 --> 55:28.080
He could be the sword fighting president.

55:28.080 --> 55:28.720
That'd be good.

55:28.720 --> 55:31.760
But I'm pretty sure that like Aaron Burr, was he a president?

55:32.800 --> 55:33.360
No.

55:33.360 --> 55:33.840
Sure.

55:33.840 --> 55:34.480
Hamilton.

55:34.480 --> 55:35.440
He was a prez, right?

55:36.080 --> 55:38.240
One of those guys who was like scrappy.

55:38.240 --> 55:40.400
One of those pugilistic guys.

55:40.400 --> 55:41.920
Scrappy, yeah.

55:41.920 --> 55:45.360
The ones that are like built like a short tank with a big mustache.

55:45.360 --> 55:45.600
Okay.

55:45.600 --> 55:46.800
But just picture this, right?

55:46.800 --> 55:49.840
Obama, okay, so the scene is this.

55:49.840 --> 55:51.280
We're inside the Senate.

55:51.280 --> 55:54.240
They're trash talking Obama being like, he's soft, he's soft.

55:54.240 --> 55:55.920
Obama kicks down a door.

55:55.920 --> 55:56.160
Yeah.

55:56.160 --> 55:56.560
With robots.

55:56.560 --> 55:58.400
Shirt unbuttoned to his navel.

55:58.400 --> 55:58.960
Oh, shit.

55:59.520 --> 56:02.400
Slices the Constitution in half.

56:02.400 --> 56:03.120
Well, he wouldn't-

56:03.120 --> 56:04.240
Stabs a dude.

56:04.240 --> 56:04.800
Okay.

56:04.800 --> 56:05.680
Here's a problem.

56:05.680 --> 56:07.600
Few things with that, that are a problem.

56:07.600 --> 56:10.240
Like a hundred things that are problematic with that situation.

56:10.240 --> 56:10.480
Okay.

56:11.440 --> 56:12.880
I can name one right off the bat.

56:12.880 --> 56:14.480
Our president is not Mike Hagar.

56:14.480 --> 56:16.000
He isn't Mike Hagar.

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
He's not wearing a belt around his chest.

56:18.000 --> 56:19.680
Not trying to rescue the mayor's daughter.

56:19.680 --> 56:20.800
That's problem one.

56:20.800 --> 56:21.680
That's problem one.

56:21.680 --> 56:25.600
Problem two, he's not even remotely built like Mike Hagar, Travis.

56:25.600 --> 56:26.640
Look at him.

56:26.640 --> 56:27.200
He's good.

56:27.200 --> 56:30.880
He's a great president and a great leader for our country.

56:30.880 --> 56:35.040
But he's not a strong man, I don't think.

56:35.040 --> 56:35.840
He doesn't look like-

56:35.840 --> 56:38.080
He's never struck me as a particularly-

56:38.080 --> 56:40.160
He's the cat burglar type.

56:40.160 --> 56:41.920
Like he'd sneak in from the skylight.

56:42.800 --> 56:43.360
Yeah.

56:43.360 --> 56:47.440
And okay, so he can become Obama, our wispiest president.

56:47.440 --> 56:47.680
Yeah.

56:49.200 --> 56:49.760
I like that.

56:49.760 --> 56:52.000
Just like behind a door frame, he sneaks in.

56:52.000 --> 56:52.480
Where'd he go?

56:52.480 --> 56:53.280
That's his jam.

56:53.280 --> 56:54.880
He's just wispy all the time.

56:54.880 --> 56:56.480
You never know where he's going to be.

56:56.480 --> 56:58.640
So, and by the way, I just realized this.

56:58.640 --> 56:59.760
I do want to apologize.

56:59.760 --> 57:04.000
I've now stereotyped Obama as a criminal and good at sports.

57:05.680 --> 57:07.280
I'm sorry, America.

57:07.280 --> 57:08.240
I did my best.

57:08.960 --> 57:09.360
Sorry.

57:10.240 --> 57:11.040
Sorry, America.

57:11.040 --> 57:20.000
Yeah, so there's got to be like, what if he could be like our most tender president?

57:20.800 --> 57:22.240
What if he just like wrote poems?

57:22.880 --> 57:26.160
Oh, and he did like fireside chats, but instead of being in a wheelchair,

57:26.160 --> 57:27.760
he was laying on a bearskin rug.

57:27.760 --> 57:30.000
You saw that video of that baby crying and he was like,

57:30.000 --> 57:34.560
hold on, let me just, do you mind if I see that baby and the baby shut its fucking mouth?

57:34.560 --> 57:37.280
Like the moment that his sweet presidential hands,

57:37.280 --> 57:40.640
his tender, tender presidential digits like touched it.

57:40.640 --> 57:41.760
You saw that video, right?

57:41.760 --> 57:43.760
Because it's, that's what I'm talking about.

57:43.760 --> 57:44.640
He's got powers.

57:45.200 --> 57:50.560
The thing is, I can't, I think he should be wearing under armor in all these situations.

57:50.560 --> 57:50.880
Why?

57:51.840 --> 57:52.160
What?

57:52.160 --> 57:55.920
Because it's like, if, because if he, he wants to keep that sports door open,

57:55.920 --> 58:02.480
and I think just wearing under armor says that I'm going to do some sports later,

58:03.040 --> 58:05.280
or I just got done doing some sports.

58:05.280 --> 58:09.360
Like he gets those sports points without actually having to do any physical activity.

58:09.360 --> 58:11.120
So it's like, and he carries around a water bottle,

58:11.120 --> 58:12.960
like one of those squeezy bottles always.

58:12.960 --> 58:13.360
Right.

58:13.360 --> 58:14.160
Analoging.

58:14.160 --> 58:18.320
Like it tells people like, hey, I just did sports.

58:18.320 --> 58:23.760
And also I'm too busy to get out of my sportswear because I gotta run this country.

58:23.760 --> 58:26.320
I gotta make laws and stuff and pass them.

58:26.320 --> 58:28.880
I'm going to throw out one last idea here.

58:28.880 --> 58:30.400
Oh, you're, okay, shut, shut it down.

58:30.400 --> 58:33.360
Barack Obama, the hipster president.

58:33.360 --> 58:33.920
Okay.

58:33.920 --> 58:36.080
I like this so much.

58:36.080 --> 58:39.600
So he could, first off, gotta grow a silly little mustache.

58:40.640 --> 58:44.720
Gotta drink PBR, pretty much exclusive.

58:44.720 --> 58:45.760
He already does.

58:45.760 --> 58:46.160
He does?

58:46.720 --> 58:47.840
Yeah, he loves PBR.

58:47.840 --> 58:48.480
How do you know that?

58:49.040 --> 58:52.720
Because it was in all the press photos, like when he was running for president.

58:52.720 --> 58:54.000
Of him slamming a PBR?

58:54.560 --> 58:54.960
Yeah.

58:54.960 --> 58:57.840
God damn, if I'd known that, I would have voted for him twice.

58:57.840 --> 58:58.880
Unpossible.

58:58.880 --> 59:01.360
Travis, if you have a picture of the president slamming,

59:01.360 --> 59:05.360
if you at home have a picture of the president slamming a PBR,

59:05.360 --> 59:05.920
Hold on.

59:05.920 --> 59:07.840
I need it in the forums today.

59:08.560 --> 59:11.680
Obama PBR images.

59:13.440 --> 59:13.760
Yeah.

59:15.360 --> 59:17.200
Wait, no, that's photoshopped.

59:17.200 --> 59:18.400
Get out of here, Travis.

59:19.200 --> 59:20.560
All of this is real.

59:20.560 --> 59:21.120
Look it up.

59:22.080 --> 59:25.200
It didn't give me the pictures I craved, but if you've got one not photoshopped,

59:25.200 --> 59:29.760
I want to see real pictures of our commander in chief slamming a PBR.

59:29.760 --> 59:30.880
Slamming a God's beer.

59:30.880 --> 59:33.200
I think it's a real thing.

59:33.200 --> 59:34.320
That's Todd's beer.

59:34.320 --> 59:37.360
Give it back.

59:37.360 --> 59:39.200
So I want to hear Griffin's last question.

59:40.400 --> 59:43.040
First, some super quick housekeeping stuff.

59:44.320 --> 59:45.760
This is the big one.

59:45.760 --> 59:47.520
The big one you've been waiting for.

59:48.480 --> 59:55.040
If you go to maxfunstore.com right now, you will be able to buy the brand new

59:56.560 --> 59:58.400
My Brother, My Brother, Me t-shirt,

59:58.400 --> 01:00:02.640
designed by Mr. Justin Rousseau or Justin Rousseau, depending on how French I'm feeling.

01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:04.960
It is an amazing design.

01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:05.760
I adore it.

01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:07.600
I could say that because I didn't have anything to do with it.

01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:10.880
It comes in cobalt for dudes and turquoise for ladies.

01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:14.880
We had a lot of people asking for a turquoise girl shirt.

01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:22.160
And so we settled on turquoise for the ladies, especially cut for them.

01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:26.320
These are high quality, soft, beautiful shirts.

01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:28.160
They have a tag you can tear away.

01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:29.360
So that's super nice.

01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:34.160
They're alternative apparel, which is President Obama's favorite t-shirt brand

01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:37.040
because he doesn't like he doesn't like those lane stream tees.

01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:39.600
What what you need to do is be like Mr.

01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:42.880
Dr. Muffin, who's my my hero in yours, Gregory.

01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:45.040
I call him you.

01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:47.520
You wear the shirt and you get on TV.

01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:48.240
That's key.

01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:51.600
Does it matter what show they get on?

01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:53.360
Don't get on Tosh.

01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:55.440
Again, because we've covered that market.

01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:58.320
Also, don't get on cops unless it's you.

01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:01.920
Unless it's you taking out a dude who just committed a crime.

01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:05.120
Like you straight up tackle him and stand up and point at your shirt

01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:08.080
and try to sneak into like photos or whatever.

01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:10.400
Try to get it into cool places.

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:13.680
Our buddy Bob Ball has actually made like a video series where his

01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:16.640
in B&B and T-shirt goes on tours and

01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:23.680
if we could just like a series of people being that guy who like ducks in the back of pictures

01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:25.600
and points at their in B&B shirt.

01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:28.960
Like I would like that to become like the new like meme.

01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:31.680
Get buried in your shirt.

01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:34.720
Get buried in it.

01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:36.880
When you buy a lot of them build a house off.

01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:38.160
Just then you'll live.

01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:39.680
Then it'll be forever.

01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:40.960
Our show will live forever.

01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:45.760
Go buy one of those maxfundstore.com is the website.

01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:46.480
Go get one.

01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:47.760
Go get one for someone you love.

01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:51.200
What better way to introduce the show to someone

01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:53.120
than get them a T-shirt and say you like this now.

01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:58.880
Also, go to the forums that's at maximumfund.org.

01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:02.480
You can find those and come talk about our show and all the other fine maximum programs.

01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:06.800
Last week Griffin made a joke about nomenclature and drinking game

01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:13.120
and we got so many emails about rules for an MB&B AM drinking game

01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:18.560
which I think that that's a great idea but we're not going to limit your creativity.

01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:23.760
So go to the forums and somebody start some line of discussion about.

01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:27.440
I have a great MB&B AM drinking game and it is while you listen to our show

01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:31.680
you drink an adult beverage and when you feel thirsty

01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:33.440
you refresh yourself with that beverage.

01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:37.200
Okay so every time you feel like taking a drink you take a drink.

01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:40.800
Every time yeah every time the spirit compels you to drink your drink

01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:42.720
then you drink it like a fucking adult.

01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:45.360
That's I mean that's less of a game.

01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:45.840
Is it?

01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:49.040
To live will be a great adventure think about it.

01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:52.000
I learned that from your fucking song Travis so don't tell me that's not true.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:57.840
Travis and also go to bit.ly forward slash MB&B AM tune one

01:02:57.840 --> 01:03:02.160
and watch the MB&B AM super show it's absolutely amazing.

01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:05.120
I want a hundred can we commission them to make a hundred of those?

01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:13.040
Yes we want to say thank you so much to people talking about our show on twitter.

01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:17.920
Jonah Skye is trying to get people on board.

01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:21.920
Deadpool Skye continuing this theme that I've just started now.

01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:26.640
I'm seeing a lot of a lot of people listening to us on road trips

01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:30.160
like Ben Laden and and Media Fairy.

01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:31.520
Media Fairy was on a long one.

01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:35.200
I think that's just great because I also listen to podcasts on road trips.

01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:37.360
Not my own podcast but other people's.

01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:41.600
That would be pretty cool if you listened to your own one.

01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:43.120
Hey do you remember when I did this goof?

01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:47.040
So thank you to everybody who's who's been listening

01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:54.240
and uh Hey Friend, Heavy Mono, Neemi, everybody.

01:04:27.040 --> 01:04:27.920
We're happy to have her.

01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:30.800
This is this is a train that keeps on rolling.

01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:35.520
Eric, Patrick, and Chimason who got a fucking stupid show tattooed on their bodies forever.

01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:36.400

You fucking dick.

01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:39.040
Uh it's by Yahoo answer user Raymond who asks does this story sound too cliche?

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:44.960
Male lawyer plus female cop plus friction between the two plus murder plus mystery?

01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:49.360
Justin McElroy.

01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:50.640
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:51.680
I'm Griffin McElroy.

01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:53.200
This has been my brother my brother and me.

01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:54.080
Kiss your dad.

01:05:54.080 --> 01:05:55.200
Square on the lips.

01:05:55.200 --> 01:06:00.960
Keep your heart three stacks.

01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:01.920
Keep your heart.

01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:04.080
Hey keep your heart three stacks.

01:06:04.080 --> 01:06:05.120
Keep your heart.

01:06:05.120 --> 01:06:06.400
Man these girls are smart.

01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:07.040
Three stacks.

01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:08.160
These girls are smart.

01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:25.920
Play your part play your part.
