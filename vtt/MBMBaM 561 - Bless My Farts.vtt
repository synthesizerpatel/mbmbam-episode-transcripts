00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.000 --> 00:11.000
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.000 --> 00:18.000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
What's up, you cool baby?

00:20.000 --> 00:26.000
It's the start of something beautiful.

00:26.000 --> 00:33.000
A small acquaintance has blossomed, it's ripened into a precious friendship.

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
I could have never seen what was coming for me.

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
Hangs at the skatepark, hangs by the beach.

00:39.000 --> 00:46.000
My life, it feels like life.

00:46.000 --> 00:51.000
Oh, it's better, it's better with you.

00:51.000 --> 00:57.000
My life, oh, it's better, it's better with you.

00:57.000 --> 01:03.000
This is true, oh, it's better, it's better with you.

01:03.000 --> 01:10.000
My life, oh, it's better with you.

01:10.000 --> 01:17.000
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me, an advice show for the modern era.

01:17.000 --> 01:24.000
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Big Dog Woof Woof Travis Woof Woof Woof McElroy.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

01:27.000 --> 01:31.000
And I have a question for you guys, is this your card?

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
Oh wow, it is. It is, yes, the Joker.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
But that's a place card.

01:37.000 --> 01:51.000
Yeah, right Travis, I've created these place cards to reserve our spot at a new restaurant being opened by none other than Mr. Mindfreak himself, Chris Angel.

01:51.000 --> 01:55.000
And it just, I didn't even want to save it for Munch Squad.

01:55.000 --> 02:05.000
It's too good for Munch Squad, and I feel like trying to put Chris Angel, who is so much a part of the tapestry of this program, into Munch Squad is like, it's kind of selfish.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
It's like trying to trap him in anything, really.

02:07.000 --> 02:12.000
That's exactly right, put him in anything, lock him into Munch Squad, lock him into a glass coffin, he will get out.

02:12.000 --> 02:16.000
Now let me ask you this, Justin, I know nothing about this prior to this moment.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
Are you kidding?

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
I know what it's called.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
Is it called Tummy Freak?

02:21.000 --> 02:29.000
No, no, it's got a great name, every bit of this story is the best.

02:29.000 --> 02:39.000
Can I just say real quick, my favorite fact about Chris Angel, as far as I know, only professional living magician to be featured prominently on an episode of CSI Las Vegas.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
Okay.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
But not as himself.

02:43.000 --> 03:05.000
My friend Dwight Slappy, you know him, he's a star of Things I Bought at Sheets, and of course Taste of Luxury, he often talks about the Phil Collins flip, where he started listening to, or sorry, the Billy Joel flip, where he started listening to Billy Joel ironically, and then oops-a-daisy, he was like deeply in, right?

03:05.000 --> 03:13.000
And I feel like that happened with Guy Fieri, where I'm just like, I'm bored, I love the brand.

03:13.000 --> 03:20.000
And I feel like I'm dipping into that with Chris Angel after reading this latest thing, where like, I'm just happy he's here, you know what I mean?

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
I'm just happy he's around.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
Tell me what the name of the restaurant is.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
I feel like that's the last thing you learn, Travis.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
Oh boy, okay, okay.

03:28.000 --> 03:40.000
It's so, it's the best, we could sit here, Travis, and for the next one hour, come up with names for restaurants opened by Chris Angel in rural Nevada.

03:40.000 --> 03:50.000
And we would, the best we would achieve would be, I would say, maximum 15% as good as the name that Mr. Angel has selected for himself.

03:50.000 --> 03:58.000
Susan Stapleton over at Eater has got the story that I'm referring to here, so thank you, Susan, for your pioneering work.

03:58.000 --> 04:04.000
Chris Angel, the mind freak magician with a show at Planet Hollywood Resort is going into the restaurant business.

04:04.000 --> 04:12.000
He bought a restaurant called Sugar's Home Plate, some 65 miles northeast from Las Vegas in Overton, Nevada.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
So a real destination restaurant.

04:14.000 --> 04:18.000
Yes, now he's got, is actually a sweet story.

04:18.000 --> 04:31.000
Apparently he's out in that neighborhood with his seven-year-old son, Johnny Christopher, who was diagnosed with leukemia, and part of the, I guess, the way they got away from it all was dirt biking.

04:31.000 --> 04:40.000
So they're out there in Overton, and they spot this restaurant, this Sugar's Home Plate.

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
They say, Magic, Magic, Papa, what was that restaurant we just ramped over?

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
And he said, I don't know, let's pull up.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
He got out, loved the location.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
Let's ramp through the picture window in the front.

04:50.000 --> 05:04.000
I should mention that Chris Angel, C-R-I-S-S Angel, his son is named Johnny Christopher, C-R-I-S-S-T-O-P-H-E-R, live that brand, live that brand.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
I love this man because he lives that brand.

05:06.000 --> 05:16.000
You can acknowledge the fact that if he named his son Christopher at all with a different Christopher spelling, it would be so wild.

05:16.000 --> 05:22.000
Now, Griffin, some may argue that he picked the name Christopher, so he did open that door himself.

05:22.000 --> 05:26.000
But anyway, I think all credit to that young man.

05:26.000 --> 05:32.000
That is going to be a unique life, and I can't wait for Johnny Christopher to live it, because that's going to be quite a journey.

05:32.000 --> 05:38.000
But so they're at Durbeiken, right? And Chris says…

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
We can just say an experience we can all relate to, right?

05:40.000 --> 05:44.000
Out there at Durbeiken with our magic daddy in rural Nevada.

05:44.000 --> 05:48.000
Yeah, we've all been there.

05:48.000 --> 05:56.000
And it's like Chris says, the more time we spent there, the more he got to know the town and the people, he just fell in love with this area.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
Yeah.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
It's nice.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
I mean, it's nice.

06:01.000 --> 06:08.000
It's like opening a camp for kids also going over with pediatric cancer and their families, and they're doing all kinds of stuff out there.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
Chris Angel, Heart of Gold, I guess.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
Chris Angel.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
He's like, I'm doing this cool thing, and we'll talk about that.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
I think, Griffin, you're referring to…

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
We are sort of backing into this, but I'm into it.

06:18.000 --> 06:26.000
Angel is planning to build Chris Angel's Escape Camp Adventures, which is another fucking great name for a place.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
Yeah.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
On 14 acres in this same region.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
Hey, Jerick, where are you heading this Saturday?

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
Oh, me?

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
I want Chris Angel's Escape Camp Adventures.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
Yes!

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
No way!

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
Can you escape the camp?

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
I don't know!

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
That's my favorite Goosebumps Chooser and Adventure book.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
So let's talk.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
So he's like, you know what?

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
I'm going to have a fucking restaurant here.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
You know what I mean?

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
Mm-hmm.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
So he made this announcement.

06:51.000 --> 06:59.000
They're going to reopen the restaurant in July with dine-in service, a walk-up window, and takeout.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
They're going to have…

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
So it's a partnership.

07:02.000 --> 07:15.000
His brother, Costa Sarantacos, and a pizza maker named Mike Baram, they're going to convert the restaurant into a fast, casual…

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
Oops.

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
Almost said it.

07:19.000 --> 07:29.000
So he's got some experienced people on board, and they're going to have breakfast, which includes…

07:29.000 --> 07:33.000
They got Belgian waffles, French toast, pancakes, omelets, and breakfast.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
Yummy!

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
Nice.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
For lunch, you stayed seated.

07:37.000 --> 07:42.000
You were so full and satisfied, you stayed in your bed, and now we're doing lunch.

07:42.000 --> 07:48.000
For lunch, we got you a nice Mopa chicken fried steak, chicken parmesan.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
You think they do a turkey club?

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
I like a turkey club.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
Oh, definitely.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
Definitely.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
Oh, yeah, yeah.

07:53.000 --> 07:57.000
Burgers, sandwiches, calzones, wraps, salads, and pizzas.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
Pretty standard stuff.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
I was expecting a little weirder from old Tracy.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
Well, there's a cocktail that's fun.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
They do have a cocktail named the Mind Freeze.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
Yeah.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
Yes, yes, yes.

08:08.000 --> 08:17.000
It says here, an eater concocted with vodka and one of more than 100 flavors of Italian ice.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
Wow.

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
That's the anchor for this whole experience.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
I cannot believe that it's not called Mind Freeze.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
The ambition, right?

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
Right.

08:26.000 --> 08:30.000
The ambition of 100 different flavors, and that's not even the point of the restaurant, right?

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
No.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
Ancillary at best.

08:32.000 --> 08:37.000
If it had been a snow cone place called Mind Freeze that was just like, here's what we got at my place,

08:37.000 --> 08:41.000
100 different flavors of snow cone and also vodka.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
Let's go.

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
I would make a pilgrimage to get to Mind Freeze.

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
Do you think he's working the counter at Mind Freeze?

08:48.000 --> 08:54.000
I mean, he's going to be working the counter at this place, which is, Travis, it is called...

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
Well, wait.

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
Just to refresh you, Travis.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
Yeah.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
This is Criss Angel's restaurant.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
Right.

09:02.000 --> 09:06.000
Where they have breakfast, and they have lunch, and they have pizza.

09:06.000 --> 09:10.000
So this is Criss Angel's breakfast, lunch, and pizza.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
What?

09:12.000 --> 09:16.000
No, sorry, the name of the restaurant is Kablip.

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
Ooh.

09:19.000 --> 09:24.000
Short for it's C-A-B-L-P Criss Angel's breakfast, lunch, and pizza.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
Kablip.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
Kablip's the name of it.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
The branding.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
I love this.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
The name of it's Kablip.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
The name of it is Kablip.

09:32.000 --> 09:38.000
Not since 90s Nickelodeon's Kablam has there been a name I've been so on board with.

09:38.000 --> 09:43.000
A coward like us, we would have thought about it for an hour and eventually just come up with Mind Eats.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
Yeah.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
And it wouldn't have been...

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
I'm sticking with Tummy Freak, but Tummy Freak is awesome.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
Tummy Freak is fine.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
Mind Eats is good.

09:49.000 --> 09:56.000
But no, he just went ahead and called it Kablip, and it's going to be open in July, which is amazing.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
That's why he's Criss Angel, and we're just us.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
Yeah, we're just living...

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
Yeah.

10:00.000 --> 10:06.000
Criss, as always, I would fucking love if you want to come on the show and talk about the show...

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
Mind Freak is going to reopen July 7th.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
The restaurant's open in July.

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
If you want to come on, you know, get at me, bud.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
Talk about your time on CSI Las Vegas.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
Yeah.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
Anything you want to do.

10:16.000 --> 10:19.000
I would be so excited to welcome you onto the show.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
Thank you.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
You could do some audio magic tricks?

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
Yeah.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
Audio magic.

10:24.000 --> 10:28.000
So anyway, that's the deal with...

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
That's the deal with that.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
Very exciting.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
I bet.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
Very excited about that.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
I bet it's good.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
Yeah, of course it'll be good.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
This is the thing.

10:37.000 --> 10:42.000
There's actually an aspect of it where if the only kind of Criss Angel tie-in is the Mind Freeze,

10:42.000 --> 10:45.000
and of course, the co-of-cublip.

10:45.000 --> 10:49.000
But it does feel like he went like, no, this isn't a gimmick.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
This is my new thing.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
Right.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
Damn it.

10:52.000 --> 10:59.000
I was sent that story by so many people, and every single one of the people had some variation of this message.

10:59.000 --> 11:05.000
I know for a fact 100% that you have been sent this a dozen times.

11:05.000 --> 11:11.000
But I can't risk you not seeing it, so here it is again.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
So thank you to everybody that sent along co-blip.

11:13.000 --> 11:19.000
And you know, when we talk about support coming in a lot of different ways, this is what we mean.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
Thank you.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
Thank you.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
Can we...

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
The name's so funny, co-blip.

11:24.000 --> 11:29.000
First of all, there's no I in there, so they can try and say co-blip, but it is co-bulp.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
And there's no way around that.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
But even...

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
Okay, let's take apart...

11:33.000 --> 11:37.000
Just ignore the abbreviation that they've chosen arbitrarily.

11:37.000 --> 11:48.000
The name Criss Angel's Breakfast, Lunch, and Pizza is such a wild choice, Christopher.

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
Well, because otherwise it would have been Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner, and then it would have been co-blad.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
And that's not it.

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
Do they close at two?

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
Or is it...

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
Can you eat dinner there?

12:00.000 --> 12:04.000
No, if you're there at four, they flip open stuff on the side.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
They have a full lunch menu.

12:06.000 --> 12:10.000
At four o'clock, it disappears, and just the word pizza appears.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
This is what you can have now.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
Now you can have pizza.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
Yeah, Griffith, come on.

12:14.000 --> 12:18.000
If pizza was included in lunch, they wouldn't call it Criss Angel's Breakfast, Lunch, and Pizza.

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
They would just call it Criss Angel's Breakfast and Lunch, right?

12:21.000 --> 12:25.000
So pizza denotes some sort of other meal.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
Not necessarily dinner, though.

12:27.000 --> 12:31.000
Because it does seem to imply, like, we have this varied menu for breakfast.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
There's varied menu for lunch.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
And then I hope you like pizza.

12:35.000 --> 12:42.000
Yeah, and if you show up Sundays 11, 14 to 2, 23, you can get the pizza brunch.

12:42.000 --> 12:47.000
Which is kind of a...walks all the different worlds, because they've got like eggs in them.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
Don't tell my brother, though.

12:48.000 --> 12:52.000
Because I have not gotten him to sign off on that, and he will be so pissed off.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
Yeah.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
This is an advice show.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.000
Obviously.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
Yeah, obviously.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
And we're going to help people.

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
I'm looking for a place that serves breakfast, lunch, and pizza.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
Oh, fuck, we can answer this one.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
Oh, we can do this one.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
No magicians, though.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
Fuck.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
Fuck.

13:09.000 --> 13:13.000
If you walk in the door later in the day, he's going to grab you by your lapel and say,

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
How many meals have you eaten today?

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
Because if you say two, you're not eating here.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
We don't have dinner.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
I keep telling people that.

13:19.000 --> 13:23.000
If you've already had your lunch, you could go.

13:23.000 --> 13:30.000
My husband and I were finally able to secure patio furniture after manufacturing shortages last year made it impossible.

13:30.000 --> 13:36.000
I'm really excited to have a change of scenery for my WFH days.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
Work from home.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
Work from home.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
Thank you.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
Yes.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
Sorry, that has been my reality for every decade.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
I got it now.

13:42.000 --> 13:46.000
Work from home days, while the weather is still nice, but I'm running against a new etiquette dilemma.

13:46.000 --> 13:52.000
Our porch is on the front of the house, and I can hear a neighbor that I'm friendly with next door working on his lawn.

13:52.000 --> 13:56.000
He can't see me, but I can hear him sneezing frequently due to yard work.

13:56.000 --> 14:01.000
I don't want to be weird and possibly startle him by yelling, bless you, from where he can't see me.

14:01.000 --> 14:08.000
But it seems like it'd be awkward to stand up, make myself known, and then say it when we're both in the middle of projects.

14:08.000 --> 14:14.000
I know the most logical thing is just to say nothing, but then I feel like I'm disappointing my mom by being rude.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
How would you handle this?

14:15.000 --> 14:18.000
That's from Allergy Awkwardness in Boston.

14:18.000 --> 14:22.000
That last part, the feeling of being rude, I think that's universal, right?

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
Sure.

14:23.000 --> 14:27.000
If I hear someone sneeze, one, it's pretty much automatic.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
Bless you.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
Something like...

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
Gesundheit!

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
Oh, why did I say that?

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
Yeah, gesundheit.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
Yeah.

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
Why are we still doing that, though?

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
The demons.

14:39.000 --> 14:43.000
No, no, jokes out of the room, just for like two seconds.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
Yeah, let's send jokes out there for a second.

14:45.000 --> 14:51.000
Why are we still blessing people?

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
You don't need to do any of it.

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
The only thing you're saying is, I know you sneezed, and I don't want you to die.

14:56.000 --> 15:00.000
As a person, I think you're worth acknowledging, and you also sneeze.

15:00.000 --> 15:06.000
I know that what you guys are saying is true, but I just pictured someone sneezing.

15:06.000 --> 15:09.000
I'm talking to someone and they sneeze into their elbow because you've got to sleeve it.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.000
Right.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
And I just look at them.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
Yeah.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.000
And I say nothing.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.000
Beryl, I'm nothing.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
What could you say, okay, let me ask you this.

15:17.000 --> 15:21.000
What could you say that would impart the same sentiment?

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
This doesn't help this question answer, but what would you...

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
Nice.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
You're originally saying this like, hey, I noticed you sneezed.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
There's a...

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
Because you sneezed and you didn't fucking blow...

15:30.000 --> 15:35.000
Okay, sneezing is weird because for a second, you're not the boss.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
Right.

15:36.000 --> 15:40.000
When you sneeze, you're just rolling the dice that everything kind of stays on.

15:40.000 --> 15:43.000
What they're saying is like, hey, I know you let yourself...

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
You lost control for a second there.

15:45.000 --> 15:48.000
Hey, I know you Mr. Hide It Out for a moment.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
Yeah.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
You lost control for a second, but I want to congratulate you.

15:51.000 --> 15:56.000
You reined it back in, and you are running the ship again, and I'm so proud of that.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.000
You didn't blow your ass off.

15:57.000 --> 16:00.000
You didn't try to hold it in a weird way that made your eyeballs pop out.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
You are good.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
You did a good job.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
You did it.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
You're back in control.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
Welcome back.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
Here's a fun thing that you can do at home.

16:07.000 --> 16:13.000
If you're ever talking to a new person and you sneeze, make a really scared look and go,

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
what was that?

16:14.000 --> 16:17.000
And act like it's the first time you've ever sneezed in your entire life.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
That's fun.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
That's got big third rock from the sun energy.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
Yeah.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
I love that.

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
Yeah, it's very...

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
Oh, bees bow.

16:24.000 --> 16:28.000
I just feel like it doesn't do anything.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
I sneeze...

16:29.000 --> 16:32.000
First of all, y'all can say whatever you want.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
A sneeze feels good.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
I like...

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
Especially when you're chasing it.

16:37.000 --> 16:42.000
Oh, when you're chasing that sneeze and you get one after a long day of working at getting

16:42.000 --> 16:46.000
that sneeze, and then you feel good from it.

16:46.000 --> 16:51.000
And I like letting Jesus take the wheel for a fraction of a second.

16:51.000 --> 16:54.000
And then when you say, bless you, there's an element of that.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
And I'm picking up subtext.

16:56.000 --> 17:00.000
And I've also laid this subtext down of, I forgive you for the loud noise you just made.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
That's fine.

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
It's fine.

17:02.000 --> 17:06.000
It's okay that you just made that loud noise with the wind inside of you.

17:06.000 --> 17:10.000
It's interesting though, because if you compare it to a burp, right?

17:10.000 --> 17:13.000
The burp-er is expected to say, excuse me.

17:13.000 --> 17:20.000
But when you sneeze, it becomes an outward problem for everyone around you to acknowledge.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
It's just wind, isn't it?

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
It's just wind.

17:23.000 --> 17:30.000
How come when the wind comes from our bellies, we have to fucking prostrate ourselves and

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
beg forgiveness.

17:31.000 --> 17:35.000
But when wind comes from our nose, we look around like, where the fuck were you guys

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
on that one?

17:37.000 --> 17:42.000
The wind comes from the belly and all of a sudden you are an outcast.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.000
You don't do that here.

17:43.000 --> 17:49.000
But you sneeze and it goes up your mouth and your nose, then it's my problem?

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
That doesn't make any sense.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
You're being christened all of a sudden.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
Yeah, it doesn't make any sense to me.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
Bless my farts.

17:55.000 --> 18:00.000
Let's just switch it for one year.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
For one year, let's switch it.

18:02.000 --> 18:05.000
And when you sneeze, you have to, oh my God, I'm so sorry.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
That's embarrassing.

18:06.000 --> 18:13.000
And when you do rip, then you look around like, anyone going to cover me on that one?

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
No.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.000
Okay.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
It's so weird.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
Rude.

18:17.000 --> 18:20.000
When you think about farts, it is weird.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
How did air get in the mix?

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
You know what I mean?

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
Yeah.

18:24.000 --> 18:27.000
There wasn't air on my hamburger.

18:27.000 --> 18:30.000
You don't put air on your hamburger?

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
I don't think so.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
It's just weird.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.000
It's just weird.

18:33.000 --> 18:37.000
Is it because, okay, and let's keep breaking this down.

18:37.000 --> 18:41.000
Because I'm frankly, boys, I'm having a lot of fun in this space right now.

18:41.000 --> 18:44.000
If the sneeze had a bad odor.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
If a sneeze smelled like a fart.

18:46.000 --> 18:49.000
Well, no, I don't even want to go that specific.

18:49.000 --> 18:57.000
But if the sneeze had a bad odor, then would the onus be back on the sneezer to beg forgiveness?

18:57.000 --> 19:00.000
There is badness in a sneeze.

19:00.000 --> 19:03.000
It's not like you sneeze and you're like, oh, thank you.

19:03.000 --> 19:06.000
Especially in these unprecedented times.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
That's a good point.

19:08.000 --> 19:16.000
I think that when you sneeze, you should have to say like, oh, no.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
Not again.

19:17.000 --> 19:20.000
Something that acknowledges a weakness in the body.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
Right?

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
Because that's the thing.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
Okay.

19:23.000 --> 19:26.000
Sneezes are a weakness leaving the body.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
This is what I'm saying.

19:27.000 --> 19:30.000
When you fart or burp, incredibly natural, it happens every time.

19:30.000 --> 19:33.000
A sneeze indicates something has gone wrong.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
Yes.

19:34.000 --> 19:38.000
Your body is like, listen, we have an intruder.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
I only know one way to deal with it.

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
Right.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
This is what I'm saying.

19:41.000 --> 19:46.000
In many ways, a fart and a burp is your body going, hey, thanks for that food to sustain me.

19:46.000 --> 19:49.000
And a sneeze is like, you put something bad in here.

19:49.000 --> 19:55.000
Do you feel like with a sneeze, there's a discussion, an Osmosis Jones style discussion in the body,

19:55.000 --> 19:58.000
where it's like, listen, I don't know if this merits it.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
We're really not supposed to do this a lot.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
Because it does trip them out pretty bad to not be in control.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
But I think we do have to blow this out of here.

20:04.000 --> 20:09.000
Also, Travis, and no, I'm not going to throw any stones or anything.

20:09.000 --> 20:19.000
But I don't think that you are the best evaluator of what is a normal amount of wind to leave your digestive system.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
Okay, let's see.

20:20.000 --> 20:23.000
Oh, but Griffin, you're making my point for me.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
I have GERD right here.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
It makes me burp slightly more.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.000
Did you call it GERD?

20:28.000 --> 20:31.000
I've only heard about this GERD every time I've eaten within a mile of Travis.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
I better cover my mouth.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
I think he said GERT.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
GERT.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
I got yogurt.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
I love that stuff.

20:38.000 --> 20:42.000
If I don't cover my mouth now, my four-year-old looks at me and goes, excuse you.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
And it cuts to the quick of me.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
It's weird that it took that.

20:46.000 --> 20:49.000
Yeah, anywho, what I'm saying is I have a condition.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
And it makes me burp, right?

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
Right.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
If you sneeze.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
Well, you could have a sneezing condition.

20:55.000 --> 20:56.000
There are so many sneezing conditions.

20:56.000 --> 20:57.000
You don't actually have a point.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
I don't.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
It's like an anti-point.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.000
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
Let's just ignore the sounds.

21:02.000 --> 21:05.000
Here are the sounds you're allowed to comment on that my body makes.

21:05.000 --> 21:06.000
Words.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
End of list.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
Words.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
Laughter.

21:09.000 --> 21:10.000
Mmm.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
Moans.

21:11.000 --> 21:14.000
What about a loud, like a loud, like, UGH!

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
Like a gasp.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
Yeah.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
Because that's a fight or flight thing.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
Oh no, Griffin.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
What has scared you?

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
And will it scare me?

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
I need to know.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
Is there a bear around?

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
Yeah.

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
Is there you being attacked?

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
You need to know that information.

21:27.000 --> 21:30.000
But if I do a regular wind.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
It's hard.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.000
I think we should just ignore all body sounds.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
Ignore sneezes.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
Ignore farts.

21:34.000 --> 21:37.000
Ignore when people jizz and they say aruga.

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
Ignore.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
All those.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
All those.

21:40.000 --> 21:44.000
Wait, when they jizz and their head turns into a big green wolf head and it goes aruga

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
and the mouth gets really loud.

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
And the steam comes out their ears.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
Like, don't fucking, don't even fucking bring it up.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
And when the shoes squeak, we get it.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
We got it when you've been alone.

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
Okay?

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
It sounds like a fart a little bit sometimes.

21:52.000 --> 21:53.000
All right?

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
Yeah.

21:54.000 --> 21:55.000
Calm down.

21:55.000 --> 21:58.000
If you're feeling good and you're a politician named Theodore Cruz.

21:58.000 --> 22:01.000
Then you can just look at him and nod.

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
Okay.

22:02.000 --> 22:05.160
Now, the one, I would argue that the one body sound we can all ignore is when your tummy

22:05.160 --> 22:07.120
gurgles a little bit because it's hungry.

22:07.120 --> 22:08.120
And you can be like, oh, sorry.

22:08.120 --> 22:09.120
I'm just a little hungry.

22:09.120 --> 22:10.120
Right?

22:10.120 --> 22:11.120
I think that one's still okay.

22:11.120 --> 22:12.120
Right?

22:12.120 --> 22:13.120
That's cute.

22:13.120 --> 22:14.120
That's cute.

22:14.120 --> 22:15.120
I love that.

22:15.120 --> 22:16.120
Yeah.

22:16.120 --> 22:17.120
That's fine.

22:17.120 --> 22:20.000
I saw an unofficial piece of merch floating around out there that said that Ted Cruz likes

22:20.000 --> 22:24.680
to pee in his pants because he likes the warm feeling between his legs.

22:24.680 --> 22:31.080
And I was pleased at first, but also incensed because, you know, that's, that I would love

22:31.080 --> 22:32.080
your IP.

22:32.080 --> 22:39.640
I would let my, that Ted Cruz is my IP, but so I'm sorry, but he's a real stinker.

22:39.640 --> 22:45.400
It turns out, but I was wondering, like, we can't make that shirt cause we'll be, it's

22:45.400 --> 22:47.600
seems very litigious.

22:47.600 --> 22:52.800
I mean, even, even saying the words out loud on this show, it does seem somewhat libelous,

22:52.800 --> 22:55.320
although this is a comedy show and that's fair use, whatever.

22:55.320 --> 22:57.080
But I was wondering if we could make a shirt that says-

22:57.080 --> 23:00.280
And I think they originally said it on Dear Mythical Morning and we're just quoting them.

23:00.280 --> 23:01.280
So- Oh, really?

23:01.280 --> 23:02.280
Good Mythical Morning.

23:02.280 --> 23:03.280
No.

23:03.280 --> 23:04.280
Oh, okay.

23:04.280 --> 23:05.280
I didn't know.

23:05.280 --> 23:06.280
But I'm trying to throw some of the blame.

23:06.280 --> 23:07.280
Right.

23:07.280 --> 23:08.280
Throw it around.

23:08.280 --> 23:09.280
Yeah.

23:09.280 --> 23:10.280
I heard, I heard.

23:10.280 --> 23:11.280
They can handle it.

23:11.280 --> 23:12.280
Yeah.

23:12.280 --> 23:13.280
Rhett and Link can take this.

23:13.280 --> 23:14.280
Good Mythical Morning said it, not us.

23:14.280 --> 23:19.760
But if we made a shirt that said Teb Cruz and it was a B instead of a D and then, but

23:19.760 --> 23:25.520
the rest of the words were normal and we put it in quotes and attributed it to Good Mythical

23:25.520 --> 23:26.520
Morning.

23:26.520 --> 23:27.520
To Good Mythical Morning.

23:27.520 --> 23:32.840
So you're saying the shirt would read, thusly, Teb Cruz who likes to be his fans cause he

23:32.840 --> 23:35.440
loves the warm, wet feeling between his legs.

23:35.440 --> 23:39.480
Sincerely, Rhett and Link of the popular YouTube series, Good Mythical Morning.

23:39.480 --> 23:40.480
Yes.

23:40.480 --> 23:41.480
Yeah.

23:41.480 --> 23:42.480
And all the funny ads.

23:42.480 --> 23:44.040
And we would sell it and keep, but we would get the money.

23:44.040 --> 23:45.320
But we would sell it.

23:45.320 --> 23:48.360
Not them and not Redbubble, not whatever.

23:48.360 --> 23:50.400
Would it help if we spelled it C-R-O-O-Z?

23:50.400 --> 23:51.400
No.

23:51.400 --> 23:57.080
What if we took all the, what if we took, instead of giving the money to charity, as

23:57.080 --> 24:01.760
we so, we too often do, in my opinion, we got to start funneling that a little more

24:01.760 --> 24:08.280
specifically this time into a legal defense fund for Rhett and Link to protect them from

24:08.280 --> 24:10.080
the lawsuits of Ted Cruz.

24:10.080 --> 24:11.080
Yeah.

24:11.080 --> 24:12.080
Ted Cruz.

24:12.080 --> 24:15.520
Hey, do you guys want a question from the internet?

24:15.520 --> 24:19.240
I feel like I don't have a name for this segment, but I've gotten so many different people

24:19.240 --> 24:24.880
sending me replacements for Yahoo Answers when really I don't think one platform is

24:24.880 --> 24:26.580
going to cover it.

24:26.580 --> 24:30.240
There will never be another Yahoo Answers unless they bring Yahoo Answers back.

24:30.240 --> 24:32.960
There will never be one, one size fits all solution.

24:32.960 --> 24:39.080
But there's a lot of places where people can ask silly questions on the web and when you're

24:39.080 --> 24:43.960
surfing it and find and see them, I think it can be fun to dive in.

24:43.960 --> 24:44.960
Yeah.

24:44.960 --> 24:45.960
Yeah.

24:45.960 --> 24:46.960
Go for it.

24:46.960 --> 24:47.960
And I'll workshop a name.

24:47.960 --> 24:48.960
Yeah.

24:48.960 --> 24:49.960
Web questions.

24:49.960 --> 24:50.960
Websons.

24:50.960 --> 24:51.960
Websons.

24:51.960 --> 24:52.960
Yahoo Answers.

24:52.960 --> 24:57.560
Some, I, we'll get there.

24:57.560 --> 24:58.560
Yeah.

24:58.560 --> 24:59.560
New Answers.

24:59.560 --> 25:00.560
Yeah.

25:00.560 --> 25:03.920
I might just say, do you want a Yahoo?

25:03.920 --> 25:06.200
But it's not capitalized.

25:06.200 --> 25:07.200
So this is-

25:07.200 --> 25:10.040
Like more like this guy's a really, Yahoo, that kind of deal?

25:10.040 --> 25:11.040
Yeah.

25:11.040 --> 25:12.040
Is that Yahoo?

25:12.040 --> 25:13.040
Some old movies.

25:13.040 --> 25:14.040
I say that.

25:14.040 --> 25:15.040
Yahoo?

25:15.040 --> 25:16.040
Yahoo?

25:16.040 --> 25:17.040
I'm trying to protect us from Yahoo's lawyers.

25:17.040 --> 25:18.040
Okay.

25:18.040 --> 25:19.600
Or somebody else, somebody's lawyers.

25:19.600 --> 25:20.600
Okay.

25:20.600 --> 25:23.040
Apollo Management Group's lawyers, I think at this point.

25:23.040 --> 25:29.760
Steven sent this one in and it's, it's on Quora again, but there's no long-winded scientific

25:29.760 --> 25:31.960
explanation.

25:31.960 --> 25:37.280
I don't know where to find who asked it because I don't know how to use this website yet.

25:37.280 --> 25:44.760
The question is, using the five senses, how would you describe your grandmother?

25:44.760 --> 25:46.680
Oh boy.

25:46.680 --> 25:54.840
The fact that they wanted all five makes me think that this person didn't necessarily

25:54.840 --> 26:02.920
consider the question fully before they put it on Quora or Quora.

26:02.920 --> 26:06.120
I think sight would pretty much cover it.

26:06.120 --> 26:07.120
Yeah.

26:07.120 --> 26:09.600
Well, now you can, what's the smell of your grandma?

26:09.600 --> 26:10.600
Everybody has that.

26:10.600 --> 26:15.080
This is what I'm saying, Justin, is if I need information about your grandmother, my needs,

26:15.080 --> 26:18.760
my needs, Travis's needs are met by sight.

26:18.760 --> 26:19.760
I don't need-

26:19.760 --> 26:22.920
We're so, we're all factory creatures.

26:22.920 --> 26:31.460
Like for me, for us, mom's mom, granny, I really associate the scent of her making like

26:31.460 --> 26:42.140
the best biscuits and gravy and bacon while smoking, just like a, I know this is going

26:42.140 --> 26:46.000
to be good, but we're in a challenging environment for this meal.

26:46.000 --> 26:47.140
A rich aroma.

26:47.140 --> 26:51.120
There is, I will say, an aspect of going over to her house, there being a bowl of chocolates

26:51.120 --> 26:55.320
on the table and eating them because I'm seven and I love chocolates, but also they do taste

26:55.320 --> 26:57.080
like a cigarette butt.

26:57.080 --> 26:58.080
Cigarette chocolate.

26:58.080 --> 26:59.080
Yeah.

26:59.080 --> 27:01.080
Is that a taste of your grandmother?

27:01.080 --> 27:02.080
Mm.

27:02.080 --> 27:04.880
I think that's as far as I want to go on what my grandmother tastes like.

27:04.880 --> 27:05.880
Yeah.

27:05.880 --> 27:07.880
I don't think I'm going to be like, hey nonster, lean over here.

27:07.880 --> 27:08.880
Let me lick that face.

27:08.880 --> 27:09.880
Yeah.

27:09.880 --> 27:10.880
Nobody should be licking-

27:10.880 --> 27:11.880
Let me get in there.

27:11.880 --> 27:12.880
Don't lick Nani's face.

27:12.880 --> 27:13.880
It's 2021.

27:13.880 --> 27:14.880
And it's like-

27:14.880 --> 27:15.880
Yeah, don't lick Nani's face.

27:15.880 --> 27:19.400
I know that Fauci's like all about it now and he's like, go nuts.

27:19.400 --> 27:22.920
It sucks how Fauci's like, everybody get out there and lick your grandma's.

27:22.920 --> 27:23.920
Yeah.

27:23.920 --> 27:24.920
Yeah.

27:24.920 --> 27:27.400
And it's like, there's not, it's like Fauci didn't even give me a chance to like put my

27:27.400 --> 27:31.600
pants back on and like they were off while I kicked it at home for a year.

27:31.600 --> 27:33.480
And then he's like, all right, wake up, idiot.

27:33.480 --> 27:34.480
Go lick your grandma.

27:34.480 --> 27:41.000
And it's like, did we, I guess, see, this is what was awesome about when Bath and Body

27:41.000 --> 27:46.160
Works was like such a big name in the Christmas present game.

27:46.160 --> 27:49.160
Is Bath and Body Works even still, is this so-

27:49.160 --> 27:50.160
Oh no, they're huge.

27:50.160 --> 27:52.000
They're expanding at the Huntington Mall.

27:52.000 --> 27:56.840
They're taking over like a gigantic wing just all for them.

27:56.840 --> 28:02.200
See when I think of the Nani smell, I go straight to Vanilla Bean because we would go to Bath

28:02.200 --> 28:06.120
and Body Works and be like, Boop, give me all of the products that smell like this,

28:06.120 --> 28:07.120
please.

28:07.120 --> 28:08.120
This is my grandmother's scent.

28:08.120 --> 28:10.380
And you would fucking, you would just know it.

28:10.380 --> 28:11.640
You would just kind of know it.

28:11.640 --> 28:16.240
Now here's the thing, you can answer about feel as like, a warm hug, that's a nice, oh,

28:16.240 --> 28:18.480
I feel safe.

28:18.480 --> 28:24.400
But I have this deep suspicion that this question asker would go, no, no, no, what does she

28:24.400 --> 28:27.200
feel like?

28:27.200 --> 28:28.880
And I'm not wild about that.

28:28.880 --> 28:32.280
No, yeah, there's a lot of senses that- Oh shit.

28:32.280 --> 28:33.280
Oh, Justin just threw up.

28:33.280 --> 28:34.280
Oh, juice, you all right, bub?

28:34.280 --> 28:35.280
Oh, fuck.

28:35.280 --> 28:36.280
Bless you.

28:36.280 --> 28:37.280
Go without me.

28:37.280 --> 28:38.280
Oh no.

28:38.280 --> 28:39.280
Oh no, they got him.

28:39.280 --> 28:40.280
They got him.

28:40.280 --> 28:46.080
He was thinking about Nani, he sensed Nani in different ways.

28:46.080 --> 28:50.560
Let's see, yeah, taste, touch.

28:50.560 --> 28:58.440
Just in touch, let's rank the senses that you, it's acceptable to sort of observe your

28:58.440 --> 28:59.440
grandma with.

28:59.440 --> 29:00.440
What does your grandmother look like?

29:00.440 --> 29:03.280
Why are you guys just going on with the show when I'm in this condition?

29:03.280 --> 29:04.280
Well, you muted yourself.

29:04.280 --> 29:05.440
What does your grandmother look like?

29:05.440 --> 29:06.440
What's your grandma look like?

29:06.440 --> 29:07.440
Good.

29:07.440 --> 29:08.440
That's the easiest.

29:08.440 --> 29:09.440
What's your grandma sound like?

29:09.440 --> 29:10.440
Like, you know.

29:10.440 --> 29:11.440
That's easy.

29:11.440 --> 29:12.440
Yeah, I know what my grandma sounds like.

29:12.440 --> 29:13.440
What does she- No, I didn't mean it when I said go on without

29:13.440 --> 29:14.440
me.

29:14.440 --> 29:15.440
You guys should be really worried, guys.

29:15.440 --> 29:16.960
It went down the wrong pipe.

29:16.960 --> 29:21.240
Smell is easy to describe, but difficult to ask, I would say.

29:21.240 --> 29:22.800
That puts it right there in the middle.

29:22.800 --> 29:24.560
Then we get into taste and touch.

29:24.560 --> 29:25.560
You're still doing jokes.

29:25.560 --> 29:26.560
Taste is the worst.

29:26.560 --> 29:27.560
I think brother's dying.

29:27.560 --> 29:29.560
Taste is the worst one.

29:29.560 --> 29:33.480
Yeah, because touch is like shame on you for asking.

29:33.480 --> 29:34.520
Like if you- Just be muted.

29:34.520 --> 29:36.640
If you ask the question, no, we hear you.

29:36.640 --> 29:38.680
If you ask the question, what's your grandma feel like?

29:38.680 --> 29:40.440
I'm going to give you a little chin music.

29:40.440 --> 29:41.440
That's for fucking sure.

29:41.440 --> 29:42.440
Oh my gosh.

29:42.440 --> 29:43.440
But I can answer that.

29:43.440 --> 29:44.440
I've held her hand.

29:44.440 --> 29:45.440
I've given her hugs, right?

29:45.440 --> 29:46.440
Right.

29:46.440 --> 29:47.440
I've tasted them.

29:47.440 --> 29:48.440
Yeah.

29:48.440 --> 29:50.480
And most likely never will.

29:50.480 --> 29:51.480
Probably won't.

29:51.480 --> 29:57.040
When I was 12, Nonny let me drive to Bob Evans' farm while sitting on our lap, and that was

29:57.040 --> 29:58.040
a long haul.

29:58.040 --> 29:59.040
That's a cool story.

29:59.040 --> 30:00.040
Huh.

30:00.040 --> 30:01.040
Any other cool Nonny stories?

30:01.040 --> 30:02.040
Yeah.

30:02.040 --> 30:09.720
When I was at Bob Evans' farm later that day, an old man had his drink stuck in a vending

30:09.720 --> 30:16.080
machine, and I got in there with my little arm and got it out, and he said, thanks, I'll

30:16.080 --> 30:17.320
dance at your wedding.

30:17.320 --> 30:18.320
And walked away.

30:18.320 --> 30:19.320
Cool.

30:19.320 --> 30:20.320
Did he?

30:20.320 --> 30:21.320
That was dad.

30:21.320 --> 30:22.320
It was...

30:22.320 --> 30:23.320
No.

30:23.320 --> 30:24.320
It was...

30:24.320 --> 30:25.320
Yeah.

30:25.320 --> 30:26.320
No, he...

30:26.320 --> 30:27.320
I don't...

30:27.320 --> 30:28.320
Not that I know.

30:28.320 --> 30:29.320
He didn't get my details or anything.

30:29.320 --> 30:30.320
Yeah.

30:30.320 --> 30:31.320
Damn.

30:31.320 --> 30:32.320
Maybe he was an angel, and he did dance at your wedding.

30:32.320 --> 30:33.320
It's possible.

30:33.320 --> 30:34.320
That's beautiful.

30:34.320 --> 30:35.320
On the head of a pin.

30:35.320 --> 30:36.320
Yeah.

30:36.320 --> 30:40.120
Well, I think my signature scent would probably be sugar-free hazelnut coffee, mate.

30:40.120 --> 30:41.120
Huh.

30:41.120 --> 30:42.920
I think I just smell like me, right?

30:42.920 --> 30:43.920
Like, just...

30:43.920 --> 30:44.920
Oh, that's Travis.

30:44.920 --> 30:45.920
That's pure Travis.

30:45.920 --> 30:49.560
That's pure uncut Travis right there.

30:49.560 --> 30:50.760
You know?

30:50.760 --> 30:51.900
Here's my scent.

30:51.900 --> 30:55.000
Put this lotion on, you'll smell like Travis.

30:55.000 --> 30:56.000
But what's that smell?

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
I like allure-om sport.

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
Yeah.

30:58.000 --> 30:59.000
Excuse me?

30:59.000 --> 31:00.000
You heard me.

31:00.000 --> 31:01.000
I didn't.

31:01.000 --> 31:02.000
Let's take a break.

31:02.000 --> 31:05.520
We're going to go to the Money Zone, and there's nothing you can do about it.

31:05.520 --> 31:06.520
Okay.

31:06.520 --> 31:17.880
Let's go!

31:17.880 --> 31:22.920
Okay, Griffin, off the top of your head, could you name me between 15 and 18 different jobs

31:22.920 --> 31:25.360
that might use Squarespace?

31:25.360 --> 31:26.360
Sure.

31:26.360 --> 31:27.360
Skateboard artist.

31:27.360 --> 31:28.360
Okay.

31:28.360 --> 31:29.360
And cook.

31:29.360 --> 31:30.360
What's two?

31:30.360 --> 31:31.360
And firefighter.

31:31.360 --> 31:32.360
Okay.

31:32.360 --> 31:46.120
And website maker, online retail specialist, and fighting person.

31:46.120 --> 31:47.120
Fighting.

31:47.120 --> 31:54.800
Fighting, and crossing guard, freelance crossing guard, and...

31:54.800 --> 31:59.880
If you want to show how well you can cross guard or guard crosses, I guess, you can set

31:59.880 --> 32:02.080
up your website on Squarespace.

32:02.080 --> 32:03.080
Pharmacy one.

32:03.080 --> 32:04.080
No, don't.

32:04.080 --> 32:05.080
You should...

32:05.080 --> 32:06.080
Hey, listen.

32:06.080 --> 32:09.400
There are many different ways that you can use Squarespace, but please do not set up

32:09.400 --> 32:11.600
your own pharmacy using Squarespace.

32:11.600 --> 32:13.800
We cannot advocate for that, Griffin.

32:13.800 --> 32:15.280
That's a good point.

32:15.280 --> 32:16.280
Yeah.

32:16.280 --> 32:19.960
If you're working at a big pharmacy chain, they probably have their own website.

32:19.960 --> 32:22.360
You don't have to double up.

32:22.360 --> 32:26.440
I've wanted to start my own pharmacy for a while, so I built a website.

32:26.440 --> 32:30.240
It's a place you can go online to order medicine.

32:30.240 --> 32:33.880
It's like, yeah, I'm a pharmacist at CVS, but their website sucks.

32:33.880 --> 32:38.760
So now I've made a website called Keith's Drugs.

32:38.760 --> 32:42.160
You can showcase your work, sell products and services of all kinds, well, it does say

32:42.160 --> 32:45.640
of all kinds, physical or online businesses and more.

32:45.640 --> 32:49.340
They've got beautiful, customizable templates created by world-class designers, everything

32:49.340 --> 32:53.400
optimized for mobile right out of the box, analytics that help you grow in real time,

32:53.400 --> 32:56.800
free and secure hosting, and nothing to patch or upgrade ever.

32:56.800 --> 33:01.400
Go to squarespace.com slash my brother for a free trial, and when you're ready to launch,

33:01.400 --> 33:06.320
use the offer code MYBROTHER, one word, to save 10% off your first purchase of a website

33:06.320 --> 33:07.320

33:07.320 --> 33:12.560
Now, yeah, I told them, I was, I did the whole like, oh, I'm coughing so bad, you guys gotta

33:12.560 --> 33:15.560
do the ads without me thinking, that's fine.

33:15.560 --> 33:20.000
Yeah, basically getting like paid not to podcast, you know what I mean?

33:20.000 --> 33:21.000
And no, they bought it.

33:21.000 --> 33:23.040
Hey Justin, you actually are unneeded, and we clocked you out.

33:23.040 --> 33:25.320
Actually, this is embarrassing because we're hearing it.

33:25.320 --> 33:26.320
We're hearing it.

33:26.320 --> 33:27.320
We clocked you out.

33:27.320 --> 33:28.320
As soon as you needed.

33:28.320 --> 33:29.320
No, no, no, I just tossed the headphones on the table.

33:29.320 --> 33:30.320
I don't have them on.

33:30.320 --> 33:31.320
No, we clocked you out.

33:31.320 --> 33:32.320
Yeah.

33:32.320 --> 33:34.120
No, I don't think they would have the guts to clock me out.

33:34.120 --> 33:35.120
No, I'll text them.

33:35.120 --> 33:36.120
Hold on, I'll text them.

33:36.120 --> 33:37.120
Okay.

33:37.120 --> 33:38.120
Well, one of them's texted.

33:38.120 --> 33:39.120
Hold on, let me get it.

33:39.120 --> 33:40.120
Justin.

33:40.120 --> 33:41.120
We can hear you.

33:41.120 --> 33:42.120
Sentence.

33:42.120 --> 33:43.120
Brrrr.

33:43.120 --> 33:44.120
That was the vibration.

33:44.120 --> 33:48.160
Are you fucking, you should fucking stop it.

33:48.160 --> 33:49.160
Sorry, guys.

33:49.160 --> 33:50.640
I'm real choked up over here.

33:50.640 --> 33:51.640
Oh, like emotionally?

33:51.640 --> 33:52.640
You need to calm down, Justin.

33:52.640 --> 33:53.640
No, it's just way down the wrong pipe.

33:53.640 --> 33:54.640
Justin, you need to calm down.

33:54.640 --> 34:00.440
That was a good segue for you to hit.

34:00.440 --> 34:04.240
I'll try to calm down, but I don't know how I do it without an app or something.

34:04.240 --> 34:05.560
Oh, right, right, right.

34:05.560 --> 34:07.520
Listen, Justin, we're partnering with Calm.

34:07.520 --> 34:11.880
It's the number one mental wellness app to give you the tools you need to improve the

34:11.880 --> 34:12.880
way you feel.

34:12.880 --> 34:15.280
Mostly, I think, mentally, right?

34:15.280 --> 34:20.440
I don't know that they can stop you from fake coughing to get out of work, but you could

34:20.440 --> 34:24.600
clear your head with guided daily meditations, improve your focus with Calm's curated music

34:24.600 --> 34:29.640
tracks, and drift off to dreamland with Calm's imaginative sleep stories.

34:29.640 --> 34:31.520
Oh my god, they're the best.

34:31.520 --> 34:35.120
Sleep more, stress less, live better with Calm.

34:35.120 --> 34:38.680
Hey, does this work on seven-week-old babies?

34:38.680 --> 34:39.680
Sure.

34:39.680 --> 34:40.680
Because it's so...

34:40.680 --> 34:41.680
Gotta get down there.

34:41.680 --> 34:42.680
It's unreal.

34:42.680 --> 34:48.920
Imagine they have all these really boring sleep stories, like where they just talk to

34:48.920 --> 34:50.600
you about a train trip.

34:50.600 --> 34:51.600
You know what I mean?

34:51.600 --> 34:52.600
Not boring.

34:52.600 --> 34:56.160
Like, just chillin' uneventful, right, as you're supposed to put you to sleep.

34:56.160 --> 35:00.800
Imagine Cillian Murphy telling you about crossing Ireland by train to help wisp you

35:00.800 --> 35:01.800
off to sleep.

35:01.800 --> 35:02.800
Wait, they got that?

35:02.800 --> 35:03.800
Harry Styles?

35:03.800 --> 35:05.400
Yeah, he'll talk you to go to...

35:05.400 --> 35:07.480
It's called Dream With Me for 40 minutes.

35:07.480 --> 35:08.480
You and Harold...

35:08.480 --> 35:09.480
Harry Styles.

35:09.480 --> 35:10.480
You and Harold Styles.

35:10.480 --> 35:11.480
Harold...

35:11.480 --> 35:12.480
Dr. Harold Styles.

35:12.480 --> 35:13.480
Do you enjoy watermelons?

35:13.480 --> 35:14.480
He does.

35:14.480 --> 35:15.480
I!

35:15.480 --> 35:16.480
You know they got Idris.

35:16.480 --> 35:17.480
They got everybody.

35:17.480 --> 35:18.480
Everybody.

35:18.480 --> 35:19.480
It's fantastic.

35:19.480 --> 35:20.480
How do we hear it, Justin?

35:20.480 --> 35:23.480
What do we do?

35:23.480 --> 35:26.360
Well, you go to calm.com.

35:26.360 --> 35:29.160
That's C-A-L-M.com slash my brother.

35:29.160 --> 35:32.160
Although I'd argue if you don't know how to spell calm, maybe you shouldn't try to relax

35:32.160 --> 35:33.160
right now.

35:33.160 --> 35:35.200
Maybe you should get more focused in your life.

35:35.200 --> 35:40.340
Calm.com slash my brother for 40% off unlimited access to Calm's entire library.

35:40.340 --> 35:44.600

There's a limited time promotion of a 40% off a calm premium subscription at calm.com

35:50.920 --> 35:55.520
slash my brother.

35:55.520 --> 36:00.800
Somewhere between science and superstition, there is a podcast.

36:00.800 --> 36:05.800
Look, your daughter doesn't say she's a demon.

36:05.800 --> 36:08.020
She says she's the devil himself.

36:08.020 --> 36:13.400
That thing is not my daughter and I want you to tell me there's a show where the hosts

36:13.400 --> 36:21.000
don't just report on French science and spirituality, but take part themselves.

36:21.000 --> 36:24.560
Well there is, and it's Oh No Ross and Carrie on Maximum Fun.

36:24.560 --> 36:28.320
This year we actually became certified exorcists.

36:28.320 --> 36:31.880
So yes, Carrie and I can help your daughter.

36:31.880 --> 36:34.840
Or we can just talk about it on the show.

36:34.840 --> 36:42.360
Oh No Ross and Carrie on MaximumFun.org.

36:42.360 --> 36:44.840
I really want to tackle the next question, boys.

36:44.840 --> 36:52.240
I think it's, it's not something we normally do, but I think we could help.

36:52.240 --> 36:54.080
How do I sleep over at Buffalo Wild Wings?

36:54.080 --> 36:56.600
Yeah, this is fun.

36:56.600 --> 37:00.240
That's a fun question.

37:00.240 --> 37:04.920
In the museum sleepover setting, which is the traditional, hey, what are you doing here?

37:04.920 --> 37:05.920
Sleepover setting.

37:05.920 --> 37:12.200
You just go, you go and you know, pull a Franklin Wilder in the fucking bathroom and just like

37:12.200 --> 37:16.320
chill up in a stall and like kick it there and just like wait.

37:16.320 --> 37:18.800
But Buffalo Wild Wings is a little bit smaller.

37:18.800 --> 37:23.880
It's easier to put eyes on all of its dark corners and crevices.

37:23.880 --> 37:27.660
You know they have somebody who sweeps it like, and not with a broom, but like sweeps

37:27.660 --> 37:32.480
it like looking for you, looking for, for wing squatters.

37:32.480 --> 37:36.600
Yeah and people are taking chicken naps.

37:36.600 --> 37:38.920
So bathroom's not going to cut it.

37:38.920 --> 37:45.060
First of all, I've never actually been lucky enough to get into a bathroom stall at a Buffalo

37:45.060 --> 37:46.720
Wild Wings.

37:46.720 --> 37:50.000
So bodacious are the queues to access that.

37:50.000 --> 37:53.520
They're booked wings out, it's out of sight.

37:53.520 --> 37:55.800
It's out of sight.

37:55.800 --> 37:58.480
So you gotta be a little more creative than that.

37:58.480 --> 38:00.040
It's interesting Griffin that you went that way.

38:00.040 --> 38:03.840
Because when I first read this question, my thought was, you know, people always talk

38:03.840 --> 38:08.160
about where they want to have their birthday party and it's like a Chuck E. Cheese, right,

38:08.160 --> 38:09.160
or something.

38:09.160 --> 38:14.840
But like maybe I want to have a lock-in sleepover experience at a Buffalo Wild Wings.

38:14.840 --> 38:17.480
Is that a service that they offer?

38:17.480 --> 38:24.640
Well let's, I don't want to squash this dream before we get into like actual tactics and

38:24.640 --> 38:28.740
strats for how to sleep over at a Buffalo Wild Wings, but I do want to say that there

38:28.740 --> 38:34.440
probably won't be anybody working while you're at the Buffalo Wild Wings.

38:34.440 --> 38:39.180
So like if you're thinking like you're gonna have like a huge like wing chomping like festival

38:39.180 --> 38:44.920
for yourself, then that, unless you cook them yourself, which you don't know where they

38:44.920 --> 38:47.160
keep the good sauces.

38:47.160 --> 38:50.360
What about the wings that they made that nobody ate during the day?

38:50.360 --> 38:52.440
Those are probably just sitting out, right?

38:52.440 --> 38:53.960
You could probably just eat those.

38:53.960 --> 38:57.000
The gently used wings, what do you do with those?

38:57.000 --> 39:00.840
That can be a fun sleepover activity is to pick through those.

39:00.840 --> 39:03.440
You can make bone art.

39:03.440 --> 39:04.760
There's a lot of stuff you can use.

39:04.760 --> 39:08.600
There's a lot of stuff you could do at a BW3 sleepover, actually, now that I think

39:08.600 --> 39:09.600
about it.

39:09.600 --> 39:10.600
Bone armor, bone weapons.

39:10.600 --> 39:12.600
You can do bone art, bone weapons.

39:12.600 --> 39:13.600
You can hunt for the wek.

39:13.600 --> 39:14.600
Where's the wek?

39:14.600 --> 39:15.600
Yeah.

39:15.600 --> 39:16.600
Where's the wek?

39:16.600 --> 39:17.600
In the wek.

39:17.600 --> 39:20.000
You could play trivia by yourself.

39:20.000 --> 39:21.000
Yeah, sure.

39:21.000 --> 39:22.000
Do they still do the trivia?

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
I can't imagine they still do the trivia.

39:24.000 --> 39:25.480
Do you think they still do the trivia?

39:25.480 --> 39:26.480
They have to.

39:26.480 --> 39:27.480
They have to.

39:27.480 --> 39:28.480
Right?

39:28.480 --> 39:29.480
Probably on their phones and not-

39:29.480 --> 39:31.240
It's probably on your phones now, right?

39:31.240 --> 39:32.240
Yeah.

39:32.240 --> 39:33.240
Hey, kids.

39:33.240 --> 39:34.240
Hey, kids.

39:34.240 --> 39:35.240
Come around.

39:35.240 --> 39:36.240
Hey, kids.

39:36.240 --> 39:40.160
You'll never believe this, but for a while, if you went to BW3s or Damon's or several

39:40.160 --> 39:47.000
other places, you could ask a person for a device that they would give you to play trivia

39:47.000 --> 39:48.000
on.

39:48.000 --> 39:49.000
It was like a big chunky keyboard.

39:49.000 --> 39:50.000
It was a speaking spell.

39:50.000 --> 39:51.000
A big chunky keyboard.

39:51.000 --> 39:56.120
Essentially, that you would punch in things and the TV would be like, you're not smart.

39:56.120 --> 39:57.480
You're a loser.

39:57.480 --> 40:01.160
Look at this person in last place who put their real name, Griffin McElroy, at table

40:01.160 --> 40:02.160
14.

40:02.160 --> 40:03.160
Idiot.

40:03.160 --> 40:05.960
I would argue, though, that in our dad's 65 years, it was the only time he was ever

40:05.960 --> 40:06.960
truly happy.

40:06.960 --> 40:08.960
Yeah, that's true.

40:08.960 --> 40:14.400
Sometimes you'd see dad come in fourth in the nation, and it was so inspirational.

40:14.400 --> 40:18.080
We would often have three at the table, because nobody else would fucking do it, but dad would

40:18.080 --> 40:19.960
be so laser focused.

40:19.960 --> 40:21.440
He might as well have not been there.

40:21.440 --> 40:25.680
Those are the times when I missed my daddy the most.

40:25.680 --> 40:26.680
This is gonna be fun.

40:26.680 --> 40:27.680
Shit, boys.

40:27.680 --> 40:32.520
I was all ready to stomp all over this one, but I think a sleepover at Buffalo Wild Wings

40:32.520 --> 40:34.720
would be one hell of a night.

40:34.720 --> 40:37.160
Some of them have arcade machines, too, so that would be fun.

40:37.160 --> 40:38.160
Yes.

40:38.160 --> 40:39.160
Some golden tea.

40:39.160 --> 40:40.160
Fuckin' forget about it.

40:40.160 --> 40:41.160
Oh, dude.

40:41.160 --> 40:42.160
I love that.

40:42.160 --> 40:45.080
The basketball ones, where it's kind of a game, but also reminds you that you're bad

40:45.080 --> 40:46.080
at sports.

40:46.080 --> 40:47.080
Yes, okay.

40:47.080 --> 40:48.080
We gotta do this.

40:48.080 --> 40:51.200
How are we having our Buffalo Wild Wings sleepover?

40:51.200 --> 40:56.680
So you spent your entire time deciding that you do want to do this.

40:56.680 --> 40:57.680
I do want to do this.

40:57.680 --> 40:59.240
It sounds fucking fun.

40:59.240 --> 41:00.240
Yeah.

41:00.240 --> 41:01.240
Okay, what about this?

41:01.240 --> 41:05.760
You need to get yourself, and this cannot be hard to find, get yourself a Buffalo Wild

41:05.760 --> 41:13.200
Wings uniform, and then be there maybe an hour or two before closing, and you're gonna

41:13.200 --> 41:14.680
start cleaning some things, right?

41:14.680 --> 41:15.680
Okay.

41:15.680 --> 41:19.560
And then just one by one, as people clock out, you just keep saying, oh, no, I'll lock

41:19.560 --> 41:20.560
up.

41:20.560 --> 41:21.560
Yeah.

41:21.560 --> 41:22.560
I'll close down.

41:22.560 --> 41:23.560
Yeah.

41:23.560 --> 41:24.560
Oh, okay.

41:24.560 --> 41:25.560
I like this.

41:25.560 --> 41:26.560
Until you're the last person there.

41:26.560 --> 41:28.560
And then you just stay, baby.

41:28.560 --> 41:35.600
Well, it would have to be a pretty huge Buffalo Wild Wings for somebody to not go, hey, I've

41:35.600 --> 41:37.080
never seen you before.

41:37.080 --> 41:38.080
You do not work here.

41:38.080 --> 41:39.080
There are six people here.

41:39.080 --> 41:42.880
You think every Buffalo Wild Wings in put, I'm new.

41:42.880 --> 41:43.880
Boom.

41:43.880 --> 41:44.880
I'm wet.

41:44.880 --> 41:45.880
I'm wet.

41:45.880 --> 41:46.880
I'm wet.

41:46.880 --> 41:47.880
I used to be here, but then I left.

41:47.880 --> 41:52.880
I don't, I don't, I don't know about this strategy, but let me hit you with this.

41:52.880 --> 41:57.400
Get seduced by the owner of a Buffalo Wild Wings franchise.

41:57.400 --> 41:58.400
And it-

41:58.400 --> 41:59.400
Wait, not seduce them.

41:59.400 --> 42:00.400
No, no, no, no.

42:00.400 --> 42:01.400
Okay.

42:01.400 --> 42:04.400
It's gotta be there, because you know that they are looking out left, right, and center

42:04.400 --> 42:06.600
for people to seduce them to try and have a sleepover.

42:06.600 --> 42:07.600
A Buffalo Wild Wings.

42:07.600 --> 42:08.600
Okay.

42:08.600 --> 42:09.600
Yes.

42:09.600 --> 42:10.600
I'm sorry.

42:10.600 --> 42:11.600
What was I thinking?

42:11.600 --> 42:14.120
If you create a real honeypot, and you allow yourself to be seduced-

42:14.120 --> 42:15.120
Oh, man.

42:15.120 --> 42:17.080
If you haven't tried the honeypot sauce, by the way-

42:17.080 --> 42:18.080
It's the best.

42:18.080 --> 42:19.080
Allow you-

42:19.080 --> 42:20.600
It's honey and CBD, which is really nice.

42:20.600 --> 42:22.320
Which is really wild.

42:22.320 --> 42:27.000
It's like, if you were the franchise owner of a Buffalo Wild Wings, you know that you're

42:27.000 --> 42:34.080
gonna be using that sexually to your advantage, as much as you possibly can.

42:34.080 --> 42:35.080
And this is-

42:35.080 --> 42:36.080
With the power to be able to-

42:36.080 --> 42:37.080
The power.

42:37.080 --> 42:38.080
Look, I have the keys.

42:38.080 --> 42:39.440
Yeah, I have the keys to the Buffalo Wild Wings.

42:39.440 --> 42:41.160
Do you wanna go make love in there?

42:41.160 --> 42:43.920
And then you could say yes, and then, you know-

42:43.920 --> 42:45.120
I could show you the weck.

42:45.120 --> 42:49.520
I could show you where we keep the secret weck.

42:49.520 --> 42:50.520
This is a-

42:50.520 --> 42:55.240
And then, you know, maybe you do fall in love, but it's probably just for the sleepover at

42:55.240 --> 42:56.240
Buffalo Wild Wings.

42:56.240 --> 42:59.760
But the one thing you never plan on when you're planning on a sleepover at Buffalo Wild Wings

42:59.760 --> 43:00.760
is to fall in love.

43:00.760 --> 43:01.760
Is you fall in love.

43:01.760 --> 43:02.760
Yeah.

43:02.760 --> 43:03.760
Yeah.

43:03.760 --> 43:04.760
Damn it.

43:04.760 --> 43:05.760
It's too risky.

43:05.760 --> 43:06.760
Don't do mine.

43:06.760 --> 43:07.760
Okay.

43:07.760 --> 43:08.760
Hey, don't do mine, guys.

43:08.760 --> 43:09.760
Okay.

43:09.760 --> 43:10.760
You're gonna need a mascot costume.

43:10.760 --> 43:11.760
All right.

43:11.760 --> 43:15.600
And then you're gonna need a friend, you walk in wearing the mascot costume.

43:15.600 --> 43:17.560
You're a new mascot for Buffalo Wild Wings.

43:17.560 --> 43:18.560
What's that?

43:18.560 --> 43:21.000
You have a letter from corporate that explains everything, right?

43:21.000 --> 43:23.440
Now you're gonna need a compatriot.

43:23.440 --> 43:26.660
Your compatriot is gonna come in, they're gonna eat a regular meal.

43:26.660 --> 43:29.460
But then at some point, you're gonna switch the costume to them.

43:29.460 --> 43:30.800
Now they're gonna leave, right?

43:30.800 --> 43:32.720
So they'll see the costume leave.

43:32.720 --> 43:33.960
But what's that?

43:33.960 --> 43:35.240
You're still there.

43:35.240 --> 43:36.240
Okay.

43:36.240 --> 43:37.240
Whoa.

43:37.240 --> 43:38.240
Yeah.

43:38.240 --> 43:39.240
Where?

43:39.240 --> 43:40.240
In the walk-in freezer.

43:40.240 --> 43:45.200
And then underneath the mascot costume, you were wearing like a thick starter jacket.

43:45.200 --> 43:46.200
Oh.

43:46.200 --> 43:48.440
They never saw it coming.

43:48.440 --> 43:49.440
You're very warm.

43:49.440 --> 43:50.440
That's good.

43:50.440 --> 43:51.440
What's the team on the starter jacket?

43:51.440 --> 43:53.040
It's the Green Bay Packers.

43:53.040 --> 43:55.640
So then you're going to release yourself from the lock-in.

43:55.640 --> 43:57.360
Now, this is important.

43:57.360 --> 44:01.360
You need to make sure before you close the lock-in door that there is a way to release

44:01.360 --> 44:02.360
yourself from the lock-in.

44:02.360 --> 44:04.160
You've gotta put some tape over the thing or like-

44:04.160 --> 44:05.160
Something.

44:05.160 --> 44:06.160
Something.

44:06.160 --> 44:07.160
Something.

44:07.160 --> 44:10.400
That's the one part of the plan where you could die from it.

44:10.400 --> 44:11.400
Yeah.

44:11.400 --> 44:12.400
This is the-

44:12.400 --> 44:13.400
Listen.

44:13.400 --> 44:14.400
This is so important.

44:14.400 --> 44:15.400
Stuff some tissue paper in there.

44:15.400 --> 44:16.400
Something.

44:16.400 --> 44:17.400
Because listen.

44:17.400 --> 44:18.400
If you want to-

44:18.400 --> 44:22.960
If you really want to sleep over at Buffalo Wild Wings, you have to accept the fact that

44:22.960 --> 44:25.000
you might die in the process.

44:25.000 --> 44:26.000
Yeah.

44:26.000 --> 44:27.000
There's a risk.

44:27.000 --> 44:28.000
There's a risk.

44:28.000 --> 44:29.440
But you've got to risk it for the basic sometimes.

44:29.440 --> 44:30.440
If you want to sleep-

44:30.440 --> 44:31.440
Listen.

44:31.440 --> 44:34.720
Now, I will say that in extreme cases, if you do get locked in that lock-in, you can

44:34.720 --> 44:38.200
start consuming the frozen blazin' sauce.

44:38.200 --> 44:39.200
Yeah.

44:39.200 --> 44:40.560
It will buy you some time.

44:40.560 --> 44:44.120
It'll get a stopgap measure at best, though.

44:44.120 --> 44:45.120
Yes.

44:45.120 --> 44:48.200
Now, you can also usually find some celery in there, which is cool.

44:48.200 --> 44:49.200
Okay.

44:49.200 --> 44:50.200
Yeah.

44:50.200 --> 44:51.200
Now you're gonna have to free yourself, right?

44:51.200 --> 44:53.720
Now you're gonna need to avoid the cameras.

44:53.720 --> 44:54.720
Oh, did I mention?

44:54.720 --> 44:55.720
Oh, shit.

44:55.720 --> 44:56.720
Those cameras.

44:56.720 --> 44:57.720
Yeah.

44:57.720 --> 45:01.720
But this can be accomplished by dressing like a ghost underneath your starter jacket.

45:01.720 --> 45:02.720
That's right.

45:02.720 --> 45:06.040
Take your starter jacket off, and you're the ghost of the guy who died doing the Blazin'

45:06.040 --> 45:07.480
Hot Wings challenge.

45:07.480 --> 45:08.640
He's there anyways.

45:08.640 --> 45:10.200
It won't be suspicious.

45:10.200 --> 45:11.200
Okay.

45:11.200 --> 45:14.360
Now, time to play that basketball game, my friend.

45:14.360 --> 45:15.360
Enjoy.

45:15.360 --> 45:16.360
Enjoy.

45:16.360 --> 45:18.440
The hard part's over.

45:18.440 --> 45:21.200
Now in the morning, you will be going to prison.

45:21.200 --> 45:22.200
You'll go to jail.

45:22.200 --> 45:23.200
Yeah.

45:23.200 --> 45:24.200
But it's worth it.

45:24.200 --> 45:26.440
But then you take off the ghost costume, you're wearing a shirt that said, I didn't steal

45:26.440 --> 45:27.440
anything.

45:27.440 --> 45:28.440
Uh-huh.

45:28.440 --> 45:29.440
I don't plan to steal anything.

45:29.440 --> 45:30.440
I'm not a burglar.

45:30.440 --> 45:32.200
I don't plan to burgle this place.

45:32.200 --> 45:33.760
I'm just having fun.

45:33.760 --> 45:34.880
And it says that on your shirt.

45:34.880 --> 45:38.440
And so when they see the security camera footage, they're like, who is this burglar?

45:38.440 --> 45:39.760
And then they're like, no, read his shirt.

45:39.760 --> 45:40.760
And you're like, read the shirt.

45:40.760 --> 45:41.760
Read the shirt.

45:41.760 --> 45:42.760
It's right off the perfect crime.

45:42.760 --> 45:47.820
And then they're like, oh, it's just a harmless little adventurer who's going to have a great

45:47.820 --> 45:50.320
story coming out of tonight.

45:50.320 --> 45:52.320
I'm proud of him.

45:52.320 --> 45:53.320
I love him.

45:53.320 --> 45:54.320
I would marry that adventurer.

45:54.320 --> 45:55.320
I would marry that person.

45:55.320 --> 45:59.280
A lot of these scenarios are going to end up with you finding the love of your life.

45:59.280 --> 46:00.280
Yep.

46:00.280 --> 46:02.160
But that's Buffalo Wild Wings.

46:02.160 --> 46:03.640
That's Buffalo Wild Wings, baby.

46:03.640 --> 46:10.280
To back up, it used to be called BW3, and the third W was for Wek.

46:10.280 --> 46:12.440
It was Wings Wild and Wek.

46:12.440 --> 46:16.600
And I think Wek was maybe a kind of bread or like an Irish thing.

46:16.600 --> 46:19.000
I don't know exactly.

46:19.000 --> 46:22.120
But that's why we kept saying Wek earlier.

46:22.120 --> 46:23.900
Was that not clear?

46:23.900 --> 46:27.080
This has been, you're listening to this with director's commentary turned on.

46:27.080 --> 46:29.520
You can turn me off at any point.

46:29.520 --> 46:31.400
We should do that more.

46:31.400 --> 46:34.440
Hey, you know that joke we've been making for the last 20, that's a reference from a

46:34.440 --> 46:38.680
TV show that only the three of us watched and had two episodes.

46:38.680 --> 46:43.200
And that's why it was only funny to us and no one else ever.

46:43.200 --> 46:44.440
Should we do another question?

46:44.440 --> 46:46.040
Yeah, I think so.

46:46.040 --> 46:51.640
I was going to do, there's like news in the chicken sandwich wars, but I don't really

46:51.640 --> 46:56.040
feel like, I feel like things have been so stressful that like more conflict is not really

46:56.040 --> 46:57.040
what we need right now.

46:57.040 --> 46:58.040
Okay.

46:58.040 --> 47:04.720
But just so you do know, Pringles is making Wendy's spicy chicken sandwich flavored chips.

47:04.720 --> 47:05.720
Yeah, good.

47:05.720 --> 47:06.720
Huh.

47:06.720 --> 47:07.720
Crisps.

47:07.720 --> 47:08.720
That's it.

47:08.720 --> 47:09.720
That's all we need sometimes is just that.

47:09.720 --> 47:10.720
Yeah.

47:10.720 --> 47:11.720
All right.

47:11.720 --> 47:12.720
You should just know that, that that's going to happen.

47:12.720 --> 47:13.720
Cool.

47:13.720 --> 47:14.720
And it's out there.

47:14.720 --> 47:15.720
Awesome.

47:15.720 --> 47:21.040
And also Taco Bell said that it refuses to join the chicken sandwich wars.

47:21.040 --> 47:23.840
Well, damn it Juice, I do actually need more details on that.

47:23.840 --> 47:27.560
Bun, mayo, chicken, pickle, bun.

47:27.560 --> 47:28.560
Not familiar.

47:28.560 --> 47:29.560
Yeah.

47:29.560 --> 47:30.560
Yeah.

47:30.560 --> 47:31.560
Yeah.

47:31.560 --> 47:32.560
Sorry.

47:32.560 --> 47:33.560
Yes.

47:33.560 --> 47:34.560
Maybe not this because, well, I mean, you know what?

47:34.560 --> 47:37.480
Actually I could tell you the story, but let me just play this brief documentary.

47:37.480 --> 47:46.800
The great chicken war, the battles began where most tragedies do with a bun in 2019, a brioche

47:46.800 --> 47:52.920
bun carrying pickles, mayo and chicken became an agent of disruption and desire, the chaos

47:52.920 --> 47:56.920
immediate and the copycats inevitable.

47:56.920 --> 48:00.160
Time sandwich syndrome sprang up everywhere.

48:00.160 --> 48:04.520
People were forced to endure hours long waits for a taste.

48:04.520 --> 48:09.080
Journalists had to find new ways to describe this blah, blah, bun banality.

48:09.080 --> 48:17.240
The victims were many, but in chaos, a single meal dare to do the undoable, get naked.

48:17.240 --> 48:24.200
And so it was, but Taco Bell's naked chicken chalupa returned to menus nationwide, unburdened

48:24.200 --> 48:29.640
by bonds, the fried chicken shell carried something greater than the sum of its ingredients.

48:29.640 --> 48:30.640
Imagination.

48:30.640 --> 48:32.640
Did it end the wars?

48:32.640 --> 48:39.200
No, of course not, but it did offer something better, a chalupa.

48:39.200 --> 48:40.200
So-

48:40.200 --> 48:41.200
Fuck, that's a good commercial.

48:41.200 --> 48:48.240
No, it's not because you can't say we're better than the chicken wars.

48:48.240 --> 48:53.280
So we've got our own little chicken war going on over here where we're the only combatants

48:53.280 --> 48:55.080
and we win.

48:55.080 --> 48:56.600
That's bullshit.

48:56.600 --> 49:01.280
It would be like if you saw two people shooting at each other and then you taped a gun to

49:01.280 --> 49:03.520
your head and you're like, I'm not in the war.

49:03.520 --> 49:08.760
I'm in a different war that I'm the only combatant in and I win gunhead war.

49:08.760 --> 49:09.760
So-

49:09.760 --> 49:13.620
I'm just saying that listen to them, like, listen, Justin, you can't tell me that there

49:13.620 --> 49:21.720
is a strong, strong thread of truth to the listening to journalists talk about the blah,

49:21.720 --> 49:23.400
blah, blah, chicken sandwiches.

49:23.400 --> 49:25.640
I mean, I'm part of the problem aren't I, Trav?

49:25.640 --> 49:29.120
I mean, I'm part of the machine, so it's hard for me to have that kind of distance.

49:29.120 --> 49:31.880
I will say this is a great quote from Liz Matthews, Taco Bell's chief food innovation

49:31.880 --> 49:32.880
officer.

49:32.880 --> 49:37.600
When you look at the industry, you see the same sandwich being introduced as new everywhere.

49:37.600 --> 49:42.440
But at Taco Bell, being a follower isn't our philosophy.

49:42.440 --> 49:46.400
We've listened to our fans and we're confident this is the perfect time to bring back this

49:46.400 --> 49:47.400
fan favorite.

49:47.400 --> 49:49.480
You listened to your fans, you followed your fans.

49:49.480 --> 49:54.280
So Liz, you followed your fans and also followed yourself, the chalupa you did again.

49:54.280 --> 49:57.560
And also, you fucking didn't invent the taco.

49:57.560 --> 49:59.200
You can't say that.

49:59.200 --> 50:00.200
You didn't-

50:00.200 --> 50:01.200
And it's-

50:01.200 --> 50:03.840
This is probably not the best time to remind you it's not a chalupa, but I guess I'll

50:03.840 --> 50:05.880
go ahead and do that too.

50:05.880 --> 50:09.880
It's- you're in the chicken sandwich wars.

50:09.880 --> 50:13.940
Like I don't know how- if you can't do a commercial about the chicken sandwich wars that ends

50:13.940 --> 50:20.920
with you revealing your chicken product, like that- that is also unacceptable.

50:20.920 --> 50:23.320
You're in the shit now, Taco Bell, congratulations.

50:23.320 --> 50:24.320
You could have just as easily-

50:24.320 --> 50:25.320
Yeah, you're in the war.

50:25.320 --> 50:29.360
You could have just as easily not- like you didn't have to do a commercial saying, fuck

50:29.360 --> 50:30.640
the chicken sandwich wars.

50:30.640 --> 50:34.440
Or it could have ended with you revealing that you'll now be selling like reasonably

50:34.440 --> 50:37.840
priced but durable work boots, you know?

50:37.840 --> 50:41.280
If they had made a commercial that didn't end with them announcing a product and had

50:41.280 --> 50:48.260
just been, these fucking losers keep talking about their identical chicken sandwiches.

50:48.260 --> 50:49.260
Fuck that.

50:49.260 --> 50:50.260
Come get some Taco Bell, baby.

50:50.260 --> 50:53.900
We're gonna Doritos blast some shit and you know you're gonna be here for it.

50:53.900 --> 50:54.900
You're fucked up.

50:54.900 --> 50:55.900
I'm fucked up.

50:55.900 --> 50:56.900
Like let's party.

50:56.900 --> 50:57.900
Ignore all these fucking squares.

50:57.900 --> 51:00.820
They don't know what they're doing.

51:00.820 --> 51:02.440
But we don't have anything new for you today.

51:02.440 --> 51:06.040
We just are so fucking tired of it and we know you are too.

51:06.040 --> 51:08.520
Fucking Popeyes, fucking- just do whatever you want.

51:08.520 --> 51:14.160
Like go eat a chicken sandwich but like just chill for like a minute.

51:14.160 --> 51:20.520
Even talking about the chicken sandwich wars gives more credence to the idea that this

51:20.520 --> 51:21.520
exists.

51:21.520 --> 51:26.720
That this is- because it is like a wild phenomena of like everyone just decided there was a

51:26.720 --> 51:30.200
war and then we all said there was a war and then the war happened.

51:30.200 --> 51:31.760
That's how it really works.

51:31.760 --> 51:34.280
Now I want to talk about the chicken guars.

51:34.280 --> 51:39.000
It's where the banquoir primarily writes songs about chicken.

51:39.000 --> 51:40.720
Hey that's- let's call it a show.

51:40.720 --> 51:43.880
I think this is a show and we really appreciate you listening to it.

51:43.880 --> 51:45.200
We hope you're having a good day.

51:45.200 --> 51:46.200
Huh.

51:46.200 --> 51:47.200
We don't say that enough.

51:47.200 --> 51:48.200
Yeah we don't.

51:48.200 --> 51:51.200
I hope that you've done something nice for yourself and someone else today.

51:51.200 --> 51:52.680
Yeah thanks.

51:52.680 --> 51:53.680
I appreciate you.

51:53.680 --> 51:54.680
Thanks.

51:54.680 --> 51:55.680
Hey thank you.

51:55.680 --> 51:56.680
Hey.

51:56.680 --> 51:57.680
Thank you Justin.

51:57.680 --> 52:00.160
I like the way you read the questions.

52:00.160 --> 52:01.160
Thanks Trav.

52:01.160 --> 52:04.600
I like the way that you responded to them and did some of your own jokes and the whole

52:04.600 --> 52:05.600
thing.

52:05.600 --> 52:06.600
I want to say-

52:06.600 --> 52:07.600
Hey Griffin you did a good job too.

52:07.600 --> 52:09.720
I thought Justin would pass it on to you.

52:09.720 --> 52:10.720
Yeah.

52:10.720 --> 52:12.480
And he kind of then just passed it back to me.

52:12.480 --> 52:13.480
It's okay I don't need it.

52:13.480 --> 52:14.480
I don't need it.

52:14.480 --> 52:18.320
I want to say that Montaigne will always be my Eurovision 2021 winner.

52:18.320 --> 52:19.320
Yeah.

52:19.320 --> 52:21.240
End of sentence.

52:21.240 --> 52:23.680
That's who I say won Eurovision 2021.

52:23.680 --> 52:24.680
End of sentence.

52:24.680 --> 52:27.000
Won our hearts for sure.

52:27.000 --> 52:28.000
And the competition.

52:28.000 --> 52:29.000
And the competition.

52:29.000 --> 52:30.000
And the competition.

52:30.000 --> 52:31.000
Yeah.

52:31.000 --> 52:37.040
And thank you to Montaigne for the theme song to our program.

52:37.040 --> 52:38.640
My life is better with you.

52:38.640 --> 52:42.520
I know a lot of people want the full version of that.

52:42.520 --> 52:43.520
It's good.

52:43.520 --> 52:44.520
I've heard it.

52:44.520 --> 52:49.080
And it should be out like, we're not in the music releasing business folks.

52:49.080 --> 52:50.080
You know?

52:50.080 --> 52:51.080
We're barely in the podcast releasing business.

52:51.080 --> 52:52.080
It'll be out later.

52:52.080 --> 52:53.080
Yeah.

52:53.080 --> 52:54.080
It's not in our control.

52:54.080 --> 52:55.080
They're-

52:55.080 --> 52:56.080
Montaigne rules.

52:56.080 --> 52:57.800
No it is in our control.

52:57.800 --> 52:58.800

53:00.820 --> 53:01.820
It's a tub pumpkin.

53:01.820 --> 53:03.120
It's really great.

53:03.120 --> 53:07.240
It benefits the Equal Justice Initiative, which is committed to ending mass incarceration

53:07.240 --> 53:11.560
and excessive punishment in the United States to challenging racial and economic injustice

53:11.560 --> 53:16.320
and to protecting basic human rights for the most vulnerable people in American society.

53:16.320 --> 53:20.840

53:20.840 --> 53:26.640
workshop sticker with a portion of those proceeds going to Habitat for Humanity of the Tri-State.

We got some stuff that we put up during the Max Fun Drive that you can watch.

53:43.200 --> 53:45.500
All kinds of great stuff over there.

53:45.500 --> 53:49.920

Do you want Final Yahoo?

54:22.160 --> 54:23.160
Yes.

54:23.160 --> 54:26.800
Yeah, this one was sent in by Chester.

54:26.800 --> 54:27.800
Okay.

54:27.800 --> 54:29.840
Thanks, Chester.

54:29.840 --> 54:44.600
It's Yahoo Answers user, Bam, who asks, how many of you do not know when—

54:44.600 --> 54:48.400
I'm sorry, what?

54:48.400 --> 54:49.400
Say it!

54:49.400 --> 54:50.400
Where did—hello?

54:50.400 --> 55:10.520
I fell—I fell off my bike and my nuts hit a car?

55:10.520 --> 55:18.280
Should they go to—should they go to jail?

55:18.280 --> 55:20.740
Can they let them go?

55:20.740 --> 55:28.880
Is there someone that borrowed your bike or anything?

55:28.880 --> 55:35.320
I'm sure there's someone else there.

55:35.320 --> 55:39.280
No one left.

55:39.280 --> 55:41.000
What?

55:41.000 --> 55:44.000
43才?

55:44.000 --> 55:47.800
In five now.

55:47.800 --> 55:51.800
Is better with you

55:51.800 --> 55:55.800
My life, ah it's better,

55:55.800 --> 55:56.800
it's better with you

55:56.800 --> 55:57.800
It's better with you

55:57.800 --> 56:01.800
My life, ah it's better,

56:01.800 --> 56:03.800
it's better with you

56:03.800 --> 56:07.800

56:07.800 --> 56:09.800
it's better with you

56:09.800 --> 56:15.800
My life, ah
