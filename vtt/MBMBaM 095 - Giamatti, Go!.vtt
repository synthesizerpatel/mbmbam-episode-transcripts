00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.360 --> 00:16.000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:16.000 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:48.240
Hello, everybody. Top of the podcast to you.

00:48.800 --> 00:50.400
A top of the morning to you.

00:50.400 --> 00:51.120
Oh, Christ.

00:51.120 --> 00:52.800
But that's the last time.

00:52.800 --> 00:53.360
You said it.

00:53.360 --> 00:55.920
Oh, lady, lady, lady.

00:55.920 --> 00:56.560
I didn't know.

00:56.560 --> 00:58.720
A touch of the Blarney Stone.

00:58.720 --> 01:01.920
Okay, that's all that you know Irish-wise.

01:01.920 --> 01:03.360
Me lucky charms.

01:03.360 --> 01:04.240
Okay, that's-

01:05.040 --> 01:06.720
Hello, lady, lady, lady.

01:06.720 --> 01:11.360
Okay, well, you said you might try that, but I didn't think you would sort of-

01:11.360 --> 01:13.520
I'm doing the rest of the podcast in this-

01:13.520 --> 01:16.240
Oh, no, you're not. That I won't be.

01:16.240 --> 01:18.400
Is it offensive, what he's doing?

01:18.400 --> 01:21.120
I can't- I don't know, because, like, we have some of that heritage.

01:21.920 --> 01:26.160
So, like, I don't know if it's like- it's like how people- if you're in a wheelchair and-

01:26.160 --> 01:28.320
It's not offensive, me boyo.

01:28.320 --> 01:31.360
It's like if you're in a wheelchair and you pass someone else in a wheelchair,

01:31.360 --> 01:32.560
you're allowed to push them over.

01:33.600 --> 01:36.160
Like, I think this is sort of in that similar vein.

01:37.280 --> 01:39.120
So are you- are you saying you'd like me to stop?

01:39.680 --> 01:42.880
No, I'm saying you sound like a handicapped person.

01:43.920 --> 01:50.720
So, what- this weekend, this St. Paddy's weekend, what are you guys getting rump-a-dumped on?

01:52.480 --> 01:52.980
Meth?

01:54.560 --> 01:56.800
That's not really like a traditional Irish-

01:56.800 --> 01:57.920
Yeah.

01:57.920 --> 01:59.280
I'm gonna drop it into Guinness.

02:00.400 --> 02:03.040
Oh, I see. What do you call that concoction?

02:03.040 --> 02:04.080
Irish Car Death.

02:05.200 --> 02:06.640
That's not a good name.

02:06.640 --> 02:07.280
No?

02:07.280 --> 02:08.240
That's not a good name.

02:08.880 --> 02:10.720
How about the sore- the sore tooth?

02:12.160 --> 02:16.400
Doesn't that drink sound like it would be called the sore tooth in circles?

02:16.400 --> 02:18.240
A sore- a sore tooth?

02:18.240 --> 02:18.740
Uh-huh.

02:19.280 --> 02:23.520
Now, what would be the l- what would be the derivation of this name?

02:23.520 --> 02:26.400
Uh, when you do meth, it makes your teeth hurt.

02:26.400 --> 02:27.040
Oh, okay.

02:27.040 --> 02:30.880
And so, when you drop it into Guinness, it's a sore tooth, because that's sort of a fun-

02:31.440 --> 02:33.280
sort of a fun, edgy bath name.

02:33.280 --> 02:35.920
Sort of a fun take on meth, right?

02:35.920 --> 02:38.560
It's basically the most fun way to take meth.

02:38.560 --> 02:43.040
The most, like, footloose and fancy-free form of meth consumption.

02:43.760 --> 02:47.840
On a completely different note, not in any way advocating the use of meth,

02:47.840 --> 02:51.040
did you guys see- I think it was American Eagle or Urban Outfitter,

02:51.040 --> 02:57.360
like, got- is- is being, like, sued by Irish Defamation Leagues or something?

02:57.360 --> 02:57.680
What?

02:57.680 --> 02:58.400
Why?

02:58.400 --> 03:00.720
Well, they- they had a t-shirt that said, like,

03:00.720 --> 03:03.280
kiss me, I'm Irish, you're drunk, or whatever.

03:04.560 --> 03:04.880
And-

03:04.880 --> 03:07.040
Kiss me, I'm Irish, you're drunk, or whatever?

03:07.040 --> 03:07.520
Yeah.

03:07.520 --> 03:10.560
And- and they were told that that was offensive to-

03:10.560 --> 03:11.120
Yeah, maybe a little bit.

03:11.120 --> 03:15.120
To Irish heritage, and so, like, they had to take it off their websites and stuff.

03:15.120 --> 03:18.240
Well, and also, it's offensive to drunk people, because-

03:18.240 --> 03:19.600
And also, it's stupid.

03:19.600 --> 03:23.200
I've never been so drunk that I forgot my fucking nationality.

03:25.680 --> 03:28.880
It should say, help me, I'm drunk, or Irish, or whatever,

03:28.880 --> 03:30.960
I just don't know, and I'm really scared.

03:30.960 --> 03:34.240
I've been looking for my apartment for, like, two- two hours now.

03:35.040 --> 03:36.400
It's very cold outside.

03:37.360 --> 03:39.520
That's how homeless people get their start, usually.

03:39.520 --> 03:41.920
This is an advice show for the modern era.

03:41.920 --> 03:43.760
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

03:43.760 --> 03:45.600
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

03:45.600 --> 03:47.360
I'm your baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

03:47.360 --> 03:52.400
Uh, let's- let's not waste any more time with these- with these, uh,

03:53.600 --> 03:56.400
blind alleys of racial danger.

03:57.040 --> 04:00.080
Let's, uh, let's get right into the advice.

04:00.080 --> 04:05.120
I work at a grocery store where we're required to stay clean-shaven at all times.

04:05.920 --> 04:11.440
Over vacation, I grew a beard that every- everyone thought really worked for me,

04:11.440 --> 04:14.640
including myself, only to have to shave it off.

04:14.640 --> 04:17.840
I'm not a big fan of this job, and I was considering getting other work.

04:18.400 --> 04:21.920
I'm a student, can- can be unemployed for a while.

04:21.920 --> 04:23.600
Is this a valid reason to quit?

04:24.240 --> 04:28.240
Should I risk unemployment to get a job I can have a beard at?

04:29.920 --> 04:30.640
Yes.

04:30.640 --> 04:31.840
This is Travis.

04:31.840 --> 04:33.040
Wait, what?

04:33.040 --> 04:34.320
No, Travis.

04:34.320 --> 04:34.560
No?

04:35.120 --> 04:35.360
No.

04:36.720 --> 04:40.320
I'm just saying that if he was already, like, thinking about leaving this job,

04:40.320 --> 04:41.600
if he's not happy with this job,

04:41.600 --> 04:45.760
I feel like it would be a real power move to walk into the boss's office and say, like,

04:45.760 --> 04:47.680
listen, Bill, I'm going to be honest with you.

04:47.680 --> 04:50.000
I'm quitting because I want to have a beard.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.320
Listen, there's- there is one thing in this world.

04:52.880 --> 04:57.520
I don't know much about women, but I do know that the two things that they love

04:57.520 --> 05:01.520
are newly grown beards and unemployment.

05:01.520 --> 05:03.920
These are two things- these are two traits.

05:03.920 --> 05:06.960
When you get the- the scraggle, you know what I'm talking about?

05:06.960 --> 05:09.440
The scraggle where you're just growing it?

05:09.440 --> 05:10.480
Ladies love that.

05:10.480 --> 05:10.720
Oh, yeah.

05:10.720 --> 05:12.000
Especially- especially-

05:12.000 --> 05:14.080
Scratchy and abrasive on their face.

05:14.080 --> 05:15.040
Waste scragged.

05:15.040 --> 05:18.720
When it's attached to a man who doesn't have a steady form of income coming in,

05:19.600 --> 05:21.280
ladies can't get enough.

05:21.280 --> 05:24.880
A look that says I have this beard because I can't afford to shave it.

05:27.360 --> 05:30.400
In all seriousness, in- in the modern age, in this day and age,

05:30.400 --> 05:33.600
there's no reason to quit a job without having another job lined up.

05:34.720 --> 05:37.600
But there's so many jobs- there's so many jobs out there.

05:37.600 --> 05:41.920
I think you can just pretty safely quit and then just know that you're gonna get caught

05:41.920 --> 05:44.000
by- by some sort of safety net.

05:44.000 --> 05:47.120
Yes, because in this economy, jobs are everywhere.

05:47.120 --> 05:49.200
Yeah, they're like littering the streets like-

05:49.200 --> 05:52.560
And people are like, hey, Obama, how about we destroy some of these jobs?

05:53.760 --> 05:55.840
To- just to reduce job inflation, right?

05:55.840 --> 05:58.400
All these spare jobs are sitting around making me feel guilty.

05:59.440 --> 06:02.720
I have to get two or three jobs just to make myself feel good in the morning.

06:02.720 --> 06:06.640
What jobs- what jobs do you have currently, Trev?

06:08.160 --> 06:10.160
Well, as you know, I work for the theater.

06:11.360 --> 06:14.160
I also am a carriage driver in the park.

06:14.800 --> 06:15.840
Oh, really?

06:15.840 --> 06:16.560
Uh-huh.

06:16.560 --> 06:17.920
And I kill bats.

06:19.440 --> 06:19.920
Wait a minute.

06:21.040 --> 06:24.080
I never knew killing bats was professional for you.

06:24.080 --> 06:25.760
Well, you have to turn in the pelts.

06:29.760 --> 06:30.560
For EXP.

06:30.560 --> 06:33.760
Yeah, monster.

06:33.760 --> 06:36.880
And then you can turn them into like cloaks and belts and stuff.

06:37.440 --> 06:39.040
If- if your skill is high enough.

06:39.680 --> 06:43.200
I am moonlighting as Stanley Tucci's wax man.

06:44.240 --> 06:49.120
I don't know that I possess that skill, nor that I have that connection with the Tucci,

06:49.120 --> 06:49.680
as I call him.

06:50.640 --> 06:51.520
Justin?

06:51.520 --> 06:53.200
I put dolphins back in their place.

06:53.760 --> 06:54.320
Oh, man.

06:54.880 --> 06:58.960
Now wait, do you mean like dolphins who like get trapped in sewers because they jumped weird?

06:58.960 --> 07:00.160
Or do you mean like-

07:00.160 --> 07:01.040
You mean the uppity dolphins?

07:01.040 --> 07:01.600
Yeah.

07:01.600 --> 07:02.880
No, I mean dolphins.

07:02.880 --> 07:04.880
It starts to think that they're people.

07:05.680 --> 07:06.720
God damn it.

07:06.720 --> 07:08.400
You take that hat off.

07:08.400 --> 07:11.360
Take that hat off and give me back my fish.

07:12.720 --> 07:15.520
That was in my sandwich and it was unacceptable.

07:15.520 --> 07:17.760
Your hijinks have no sway here.

07:18.480 --> 07:20.560
I get back in the ocean, sir.

07:21.680 --> 07:23.360
And then I- that's pretty much it.

07:23.360 --> 07:24.640
And then I get all sheepish.

07:24.640 --> 07:25.360
And that's a job?

07:26.080 --> 07:27.360
That's a job.

07:27.360 --> 07:29.040
Who pays you to do this?

07:29.760 --> 07:30.240
Sharks.

07:30.880 --> 07:31.760
Sharks.

07:32.400 --> 07:32.880
Sharks.

07:33.440 --> 07:34.800
Sharks pay me in apples.

07:38.880 --> 07:41.360
The maritime economy is so strange.

07:42.160 --> 07:43.360
They don't know what we use.

07:44.880 --> 07:46.800
All these ocean apples.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.320
You humans like apples, right?

07:48.320 --> 07:49.280
Hey, you like apples?

07:49.840 --> 07:51.120
Like, dolphins don't like fish.

07:51.120 --> 07:52.800
It's just what we throw at them because they're dumb.

07:53.360 --> 07:56.240
Like, sharks- sharks pay me in apples.

07:56.240 --> 07:58.480
They think that that's the kind of currency.

07:59.600 --> 08:00.800
I don't know why.

08:00.800 --> 08:02.240
Fucking sharks, man.

08:02.240 --> 08:06.080
No, don't, like, have another- get another job.

08:06.080 --> 08:08.080
This should be a good role for everybody.

08:08.080 --> 08:10.160
Get another job before you quit the last job.

08:10.160 --> 08:11.600
So, before beard.

08:11.600 --> 08:15.920
Or go in and be like, grow your beard out secretly.

08:15.920 --> 08:17.280
Wear a burqa or something.

08:17.280 --> 08:19.680
Grow your beard out secretly and go in and be like,

08:19.680 --> 08:21.200
this is what you are missing.

08:22.000 --> 08:22.720
Also, you need-

08:22.720 --> 08:23.920
Look at this look.

08:23.920 --> 08:28.080
You need to take a long look in that deep, dark, truthful mirror

08:28.080 --> 08:30.480
and really think about if this beard

08:30.480 --> 08:32.880
that you grew over a vacation

08:33.600 --> 08:37.520
is really as critically acclaimed as you said it is.

08:39.520 --> 08:40.800
Really think about that.

08:40.800 --> 08:42.560
Really think about the inflection people had.

08:42.560 --> 08:44.880
On last day was a six-month vacation.

08:44.880 --> 08:46.960
Yeah, did they say- did they say,

08:46.960 --> 08:48.560
oh, um-

08:48.560 --> 08:49.200
A beard.

08:49.200 --> 08:50.640
That looks great.

08:51.280 --> 08:52.080
I kept to-

08:52.080 --> 08:53.040
Keep it up.

08:53.040 --> 08:56.880
I kept a scrowdy, rowdy, scraggle-daggle on my face

08:57.600 --> 08:59.360
for a couple of years

09:00.480 --> 09:01.920
before I realized that,

09:01.920 --> 09:04.000
hey, this doesn't actually look very good.

09:04.000 --> 09:08.000
And I had tricked myself into thinking it was all the rage.

09:08.000 --> 09:08.720
I know.

09:08.720 --> 09:10.240
I still feel guilty about that.

09:10.240 --> 09:14.320
Griffin walked around looking like a Bob Denver impersonator

09:14.320 --> 09:16.960
and I said nothing to him.

09:18.880 --> 09:20.080
You know, from Gilligan's Island.

09:20.080 --> 09:22.240
Also, uh, Dobie Gillis.

09:22.960 --> 09:23.680
Dobie Gillis.

09:24.320 --> 09:25.120
Take care of your face.

09:26.400 --> 09:27.680
It's the only gift you have.

09:28.400 --> 09:29.600
That's all you've got going for you.

09:29.600 --> 09:31.040
All you've got going for is your face.

09:31.040 --> 09:31.920
Don't cover it up.

09:31.920 --> 09:33.280
Don't fuck up your moneymaker.

09:33.840 --> 09:34.240
That's where-

09:34.240 --> 09:35.920
No, your moneymaker's your fucking job.

09:35.920 --> 09:36.960
Don't fuck that up either.

09:37.840 --> 09:40.080
Your moneymaker's your bagging hands.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.440
You gotta keep those safe.

09:41.440 --> 09:42.800
Don't worry about your face.

09:42.800 --> 09:44.320
I just also want to throw out

09:44.320 --> 09:47.280
what kind of fucking grocery store doesn't let people have beard?

09:47.280 --> 09:48.240
Like, I don't understand-

09:48.240 --> 09:51.200
I- If you find out, let me know and I will attend.

09:51.840 --> 09:54.000
It will be my sole source of grocery.

09:54.960 --> 09:56.640
You don't want to buy my Aunt Jemima

09:56.640 --> 09:58.960
from someone that's not clean shorn.

09:58.960 --> 10:01.040
In this bag, I'm gonna put your eggs

10:01.040 --> 10:02.240
and I'm gonna put your juice

10:02.240 --> 10:04.400
and I'm gonna put a few of these little chin hairs.

10:04.960 --> 10:07.680
Just gonna sprinkle them in there like so much oregano.

10:09.680 --> 10:11.440
Maybe he works in the deli or something.

10:12.720 --> 10:13.600
Or we'll get that.

10:14.960 --> 10:16.160
That made me sense, right?

10:16.160 --> 10:19.280
Don't they make beard nets for just such an occasion?

10:19.280 --> 10:21.760
Yeah, but you can't be, like, walking around with a beard net.

10:21.760 --> 10:22.240
It's weird.

10:22.240 --> 10:23.040
Mm-hmm.

10:23.040 --> 10:24.640
You can't be seen with a beard net.

10:24.640 --> 10:26.640
This is a jockstrap, basically.

10:26.640 --> 10:28.080
A jockstrap for your chin.

10:28.080 --> 10:28.320
Yeah.

10:28.320 --> 10:30.480
It's also, like, saying to the world, like,

10:30.480 --> 10:32.960
I've got this beard, but I cannot keep a handle on it.

10:34.160 --> 10:35.760
His beard is out of control.

10:35.760 --> 10:37.760
It's like boarding school for beards.

10:37.760 --> 10:38.400
Like, you can't-

10:38.960 --> 10:41.280
You can't- It's saying, like, I don't know what to do with it.

10:41.280 --> 10:42.880
It's got its own mind.

10:42.880 --> 10:46.160
Mind of its own, I'd say.

10:46.160 --> 10:46.560
Griffin.

10:47.280 --> 10:48.320
You want a Yahoo answer?

10:49.200 --> 10:49.520
Yeah.

10:52.160 --> 10:52.720
This is great.

10:52.720 --> 10:54.320
This one was sent in by Lisa Holifield.

10:54.320 --> 10:54.960
Thank you, Lisa.

10:55.520 --> 11:03.840
It's by Yahoo Answers user Holly, who posted in the Yahoo Answers rodents category.

11:05.280 --> 11:07.920
And asks, how to take care of a duck.

11:07.920 --> 11:11.680
I'm thinking of getting a pet duck, but I don't know much about them.

11:11.680 --> 11:12.240
Clearly.

11:15.200 --> 11:17.520
Some phylum genus action would be good.

11:17.520 --> 11:17.920
Just to-

11:17.920 --> 11:19.360
Maybe just, like, a dictionary.

11:19.360 --> 11:21.120
Just look up the word duck.

11:21.120 --> 11:22.560
Have you seen the duck yet?

11:23.760 --> 11:26.960
Respondent Yahoo Answers user CP4 says,

11:26.960 --> 11:29.520
well, the first thing you should know is that it is not a rodent.

11:32.000 --> 11:35.280
Oh, Yahoo Answers, taking care of our light work since 2010.

11:35.280 --> 11:38.080
Yahoo Answers, taking care of our light work since 2003.

11:38.640 --> 11:40.240
Yahoo Answers user Matt says,

11:40.240 --> 11:42.800
here's a list I've constructed for your consideration.

11:42.800 --> 11:44.720
One, let the duck go.

11:44.720 --> 11:46.800
Two, watch the duck fly away.

11:46.800 --> 11:49.040
Three, go buy a rodent.

11:49.040 --> 11:50.960
Four, go about with your normal life.

11:53.200 --> 11:53.680
Source?

11:54.880 --> 11:56.080
I am a duckologist.

11:56.080 --> 12:08.320
Well, the first thing you're gonna want to do, so many people neglect.

12:09.040 --> 12:10.000
Webbing cream.

12:10.640 --> 12:13.040
They get a lot of irritation there.

12:13.040 --> 12:13.520
Are you-

12:13.520 --> 12:16.720
Now, is this a cream that you make out of duck foot webbing?

12:16.720 --> 12:17.440
Or is this-

12:17.440 --> 12:18.480
That would be cruel.

12:18.480 --> 12:19.840
No, this is a balm.

12:20.640 --> 12:24.400
It's a poultice that you rub onto the webbing of a duck.

12:24.400 --> 12:30.240
So from its day of like stepping on pine cones and other irritants,

12:31.040 --> 12:36.800
it will soothe the webbing and make sure that it stays, you know, uninfected.

12:36.800 --> 12:40.480
Now, step two, and this is a tricky one and it's gonna take some time,

12:40.480 --> 12:43.200
but you have to train the duck to say, put it on my bill.

12:45.360 --> 12:47.280
It's the only good reason to have a duck.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.200
Oh man, what a duck.

12:52.640 --> 12:53.440
What a great duck.

12:53.440 --> 12:56.160
Griffin, do you have any duck raising tips?

12:57.200 --> 13:07.840
Um, make it a, um, fucking, uh, make it a shirt.

13:07.840 --> 13:09.520
Make it, I guess, duck clothes.

13:13.520 --> 13:15.440
Dress it up like Scrooge McDuck, obviously.

13:16.240 --> 13:16.720
That's good.

13:17.840 --> 13:18.880
Yeah, I wish I said that.

13:18.880 --> 13:20.560
Little spats on its webbed feet.

13:20.560 --> 13:25.200
Um, I can't imagine having a bird.

13:26.240 --> 13:31.120
I was at a, uh, a hamburger stand the other day eating a hamburger.

13:31.120 --> 13:32.160
Was this a food truck?

13:33.120 --> 13:35.520
No, no, it was a, it was an establishment.

13:35.520 --> 13:37.840
They just didn't have an indoor dining area.

13:37.840 --> 13:41.360
They had some shit out back where you could just chill on some picnic tables

13:41.920 --> 13:43.760
and enjoy your frozen custard.

13:43.760 --> 13:49.840
And I was there and I was, I was just surrounded by pigeons

13:49.840 --> 13:57.680
and finches and, and sparrows in all manner of, of tiny woodland birds.

13:57.680 --> 14:01.840
And, uh, I just had a constant panic attack the entire time I was there.

14:01.840 --> 14:05.040
Couldn't enjoy my meal because I was surrounded by tiny birds.

14:05.040 --> 14:08.960
And I have friends here in Texas who have like chickens.

14:08.960 --> 14:10.160
You have pet chickens.

14:10.160 --> 14:10.560
Can't.

14:10.560 --> 14:11.680
Unacceptable.

14:11.680 --> 14:12.560
Can't fathom.

14:13.120 --> 14:13.520
Okay.

14:13.520 --> 14:14.560
Cause here's the thing.

14:14.560 --> 14:17.120
I agree with you, Griffin, a hundred percent.

14:17.120 --> 14:20.240
And I know of people that have like cockatiels and

14:20.240 --> 14:21.760
parrots and that kind of thing.

14:22.560 --> 14:24.960
And it's like, okay, they're, you know, they're beautiful birds

14:24.960 --> 14:27.680
and they fly around, but a duck or like a chicken,

14:27.680 --> 14:31.120
they're just like a big stupid walking around on the ground bird.

14:31.120 --> 14:31.760
Yeah.

14:31.760 --> 14:32.960
Like don't get it.

14:32.960 --> 14:34.400
Think about bird for a second.

14:34.400 --> 14:38.240
Like if you have a pet bird, pet bird, like if you have a dog,

14:38.240 --> 14:40.080
it can come and snuggle up on you.

14:40.080 --> 14:46.000
Cat can pat its little, little feet on you and, and, and ignore you most of the time.

14:46.000 --> 14:46.560
Yeah.

14:46.560 --> 14:50.640
A bird has two methods of interaction with the outside world.

14:51.520 --> 14:53.120
Talons and a poker.

14:53.760 --> 14:54.400
That's it.

14:54.400 --> 14:54.880
All it can do is-

14:54.880 --> 14:56.880
Talons and a poker and yelling.

14:56.880 --> 14:58.480
Just come up and yelling.

14:58.480 --> 15:00.080
Shitting everywhere.

15:00.080 --> 15:03.200
Like those are the interactions a bird can have with the outside world.

15:03.200 --> 15:04.640
Why would you want that in your home?

15:05.280 --> 15:06.480
Why would you want anything?

15:06.480 --> 15:08.960
I'm going to offend so many people right now.

15:08.960 --> 15:09.280
Sorry, bird.

15:09.280 --> 15:10.560
A dog and a cat.

15:10.560 --> 15:12.640
Why would you want anything other than a dog and a cat?

15:12.640 --> 15:14.800
You can teach a dog to go outside.

15:14.800 --> 15:16.480
You can teach a cat to poop in a box.

15:16.480 --> 15:16.800
Okay.

15:16.800 --> 15:21.120
But what about hilariously comically large rabbits?

15:22.000 --> 15:22.320
Okay.

15:22.320 --> 15:22.880
That's fine.

15:23.600 --> 15:26.400
And like, and you call them like Floppenstein or something?

15:26.400 --> 15:28.400
How about sugar gliders?

15:30.080 --> 15:33.600
Oh, that's what, cause that's been the problem with mice this whole time.

15:33.600 --> 15:34.960
Their inability to fly.

15:37.200 --> 15:38.560
Thank God for sugar.

15:38.560 --> 15:45.680
Thank you County Ferris all over this great land for putting a race of flying mice throughout

15:45.680 --> 15:46.080
the-

15:46.080 --> 15:46.960
Forgiven it.

15:46.960 --> 15:51.440
And also just FYI, sugar glider pelts aren't worth as much as bat.

15:53.600 --> 15:55.280
You only make that mistake once.

15:55.280 --> 15:56.240
Travis has a chart.

15:57.600 --> 16:01.760
If you do, ladies and gentlemen, this is a plea from me to you.

16:01.760 --> 16:06.000
If you do buy a duck and take it home to raise your own,

16:06.000 --> 16:08.640
or don't let him drop out of school.

16:09.200 --> 16:13.760
There's, there's going to be a real temptation because he won't understand any of it and

16:13.760 --> 16:14.480
he can't write.

16:15.120 --> 16:20.320
But a duck without an education, there's nothing sadder in my opinion.

16:21.280 --> 16:32.240
And if you, if the duck that you have adopted becomes, let's say racially insensitive towards

16:32.240 --> 16:38.080
Japanese people, then you really, really need to take a good hard look at it because there's

16:38.080 --> 16:40.560
a good chance that you just adopted Gilbert Gottfried.

16:43.200 --> 16:51.120
He is similar to ducks, not only in fashion, but in manner, which is why he was such a

16:51.120 --> 16:52.800
perfect choice for the Aflac.

16:52.800 --> 16:54.720
This bit is fucking stupid.

16:57.120 --> 16:59.040
Bad news for you, I'm editing today.

16:59.040 --> 17:00.080
So I'm going to frame it.

17:00.080 --> 17:04.080
I'm going to frame it with special sound effects and guitar riffs.

17:04.080 --> 17:07.600
And here it is, Griffin's bit about Gilbert Gottfried.

17:07.600 --> 17:10.880
There's a goof in there somewhere about how Gilbert Gottfried is duck-like.

17:11.440 --> 17:14.720
But I think the Aflac connection sort of sullies.

17:14.720 --> 17:17.360
The problem, your problem is, was looking for the goof.

17:17.360 --> 17:21.760
Like you should just say, I, I, earlier I had something about sharks paying me with

17:21.760 --> 17:22.080
apples.

17:22.080 --> 17:24.160
Just say the first goddamn thing that comes to your head.

17:24.160 --> 17:25.760
Let the goof find you.

17:25.760 --> 17:29.360
Then 90% of the audience would hear it and be like, oh, he's making a dumb Aflac goof.

17:29.360 --> 17:33.360
But the other 10% would understand how avant-garde that was.

17:33.360 --> 17:35.840
How edgy your Gilbert Gottfried goof was.

17:36.800 --> 17:40.480
If you guys could adopt one celebrity, who would it be?

17:40.480 --> 17:42.480
Obviously not Gilbert Gottfried.

17:42.480 --> 17:44.000
He's going to keep you rolling, right?

17:44.000 --> 17:46.800
With, with all the, with all like the zingers.

17:46.800 --> 17:51.600
But I don't think that the rest of it would make up for it.

17:51.600 --> 17:52.480
Ian McShane.

17:53.040 --> 17:53.360
Okay.

17:55.040 --> 17:57.360
What would Ian McShane be like, Travis?

17:57.360 --> 18:00.400
Mostly he'd just shuffle around the house in a bathrobe cursing.

18:01.280 --> 18:02.240
Sounds pretty good.

18:02.240 --> 18:02.800
Yeah, right?

18:02.800 --> 18:03.680
Wouldn't that be awesome?

18:03.680 --> 18:06.880
And just have friends over and be like, oh, don't mind my Ian McShane.

18:07.600 --> 18:09.680
Don't let him, don't let him climb on your lap.

18:09.680 --> 18:12.480
Ian, down, down, down.

18:12.480 --> 18:12.800
Ian.

18:14.800 --> 18:17.360
I'm going to go, I'm going to go with Giamatti.

18:17.360 --> 18:22.480
Oh, he would, I imagine him like hiding up in the corner of the ceiling.

18:23.040 --> 18:25.360
Just spot him with a flashlight to get him down.

18:25.360 --> 18:26.080
Don't look at him.

18:26.080 --> 18:27.440
It's a challenge.

18:27.440 --> 18:29.440
Giamatti.

18:31.440 --> 18:33.600
Do you know what the problem with having a pet Giamatti is?

18:34.320 --> 18:35.440
He's a Pokemon.

18:37.200 --> 18:38.000
Giamatti.

18:39.280 --> 18:40.160
Giamatti, go.

18:41.040 --> 18:41.920
You're so skittish.

18:43.120 --> 18:43.280
Go.

18:43.280 --> 18:44.320
Oh, God.

18:45.120 --> 18:48.720
Giamatti is the human equivalent of a comically large rabbit, I feel like.

18:50.800 --> 18:51.440
Oh, crap.

18:52.240 --> 18:52.640
Justin.

18:53.760 --> 18:54.480
What?

18:54.480 --> 18:56.400
You got a celeb?

18:56.400 --> 18:59.040
I'm not going to adopt a celebrity to make any goddamn sense.

19:00.320 --> 19:00.880
They're people.

19:00.880 --> 19:01.920
They live in houses.

19:01.920 --> 19:03.440
They are human beings.

19:03.440 --> 19:04.800
I don't understand.

19:04.800 --> 19:05.920
I don't understand the question.

19:06.480 --> 19:09.440
Hey, I'm a guy and also a monster.

19:10.000 --> 19:10.560
Oh, whoa.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.600
And also a monster.

19:13.600 --> 19:14.800
And also a monster.

19:15.360 --> 19:22.160
I started sleeping with a close friend of mine, a girl, who also plays bass in my band,

19:22.160 --> 19:24.400
bass in my band.

19:24.400 --> 19:29.520
We were, quote, friends with benefits, end quote, for about six months, but it never

19:29.520 --> 19:32.880
really developed into an exclusive relationship.

19:32.880 --> 19:36.800
She feels heartbroken because I recently slept with another girl, and this may have

19:36.800 --> 19:39.040
ruined a wonderful friendship as well as our band.

19:39.760 --> 19:41.680
Is there any way to salvage our friendship?

19:43.920 --> 19:45.040
Probably unforgivable.

19:45.040 --> 19:50.880
So I guess the band maybe is not finding the success that he had hoped for.

19:50.880 --> 19:52.880
That's maybe not top priority at this point.

19:52.880 --> 19:53.380
Right.

19:54.720 --> 19:56.960
Hey, dude, you done goofed.

19:56.960 --> 19:57.840
Yeah, oh, man.

19:57.840 --> 19:59.840
The number of ways in which you've goofed.

19:59.840 --> 20:04.000
You goofed, but if you can keep the band together, wow, you're going to write some

20:04.000 --> 20:04.640
good stuff.

20:04.640 --> 20:08.960
Look at Fleetwood Mac.

20:09.680 --> 20:10.400
Oh, yeah.

20:10.960 --> 20:17.200
Like, they fought and fought and fought and fought and they didn't stay in love, but

20:17.200 --> 20:18.800
they stayed in love with the music.

20:18.800 --> 20:22.240
And the pain, you can just feel it in Tusk.

20:22.240 --> 20:25.360
Nothing powers good rock and roll like sexual contempt.

20:25.920 --> 20:26.420
Right.

20:28.160 --> 20:33.200
Holland Oates, so bitter, so broken hearted.

20:33.200 --> 20:34.800
I can't believe you did this to me, Oates.

20:35.280 --> 20:39.520
Dave Matthews Band, there's so many members, you know, some people.

20:40.400 --> 20:45.600
Let's just say Oates has that mustache to cover a really, really embarrassing scar,

20:45.600 --> 20:46.640
and let's leave it at that.

20:46.640 --> 20:49.840
I think this is the problem with the friends with benefits deal.

20:49.840 --> 20:51.520
Yeah, because it's a fantasy.

20:51.520 --> 20:53.120
Yeah, it really is.

20:53.120 --> 20:55.600
It's a game.

20:55.600 --> 20:59.440
It doesn't work because you're sitting there and you're like, oh, this is so nice, and

20:59.440 --> 21:03.440
there's no strings attached, and I can do whatever, and then you sleep with someone

21:03.440 --> 21:05.120
else and you somehow piss them off.

21:05.120 --> 21:11.600
In that explanation, you actually reference two movie titles about having sex with your

21:11.600 --> 21:13.040
bud, Bud Love.

21:13.040 --> 21:15.200
You've got a friends with benefits deal.

21:15.200 --> 21:18.320
And you've got a friends with benefits deal with Crocodile Dundee.

21:22.720 --> 21:30.560
The thing about friends with benefits is that it seems like a smashing idea if you're a

21:30.560 --> 21:37.840
single person, but what's friends with benefits is more is a constant beautiful reminder of

21:37.840 --> 21:40.320
the power of biology over us.

21:40.320 --> 21:46.240
Like, we think to ourselves, hey, I think that I'll do this friends with benefits thing,

21:46.240 --> 21:47.920
and biology is like, oh, yeah, good one.

21:47.920 --> 21:49.920
No one's ever thought of that before.

21:49.920 --> 21:53.040
I won't force you to have emotions about this, but of course you do.

21:53.040 --> 21:53.680
Of course you do.

21:54.320 --> 22:02.320
The human heart is not as much older and wiser than our rapidly crumbling morales.

22:02.320 --> 22:06.880
Yes, and unfortunately, there are certain chemicals and things released in your brain

22:06.880 --> 22:11.920
during intimate moments that make you feel emotionally connected to the person.

22:11.920 --> 22:14.160
Yeah, like horny dioxide and things like that.

22:15.760 --> 22:19.600
They get in there and they trigger the love center.

22:19.600 --> 22:20.800
Boner juice.

22:20.800 --> 22:22.560
Boner juice is just another one.

22:22.560 --> 22:26.160
Less scientific, of course, but no less real and actual.

22:26.160 --> 22:27.360
Street slang.

22:27.360 --> 22:30.320
Street slang that Griffin uses for brain chemicals.

22:30.320 --> 22:35.600
This is the thing, though, like you played the game of bones and you lost.

22:35.600 --> 22:38.000
This is what happens.

22:38.000 --> 22:44.720
You try to come out on top, and no one ever does.

22:44.720 --> 22:46.720
Except for Dinklage.

22:46.720 --> 22:47.360
What?

22:47.360 --> 22:48.320
Except Dinklage.

22:48.320 --> 22:49.360
Except Pete Dink.

22:49.360 --> 22:50.800
Pete Dink, number one.

22:52.800 --> 22:58.320
I think the problem is the friends with benefits move, that play,

22:58.320 --> 23:02.480
that play is like cheating because you're saying like,

23:02.480 --> 23:06.080
I want to have the sex, but I don't want to put the time in the relationship.

23:06.080 --> 23:07.920
So basically, I think what you're really saying is,

23:07.920 --> 23:10.080
I want to do this thing and eventually fuck it up.

23:10.960 --> 23:11.460
Right.

23:12.000 --> 23:15.600
Yeah, there's no good ending to that.

23:15.600 --> 23:20.320
The arc, if you look at the arc, it just doesn't pan out.

23:21.520 --> 23:26.560
The only good arc to keep, and maybe this is my Protestant upbringing

23:26.560 --> 23:32.320
rearing its head, is just to keep unrealized sexual tension forever.

23:32.320 --> 23:32.880
Yeah.

23:32.880 --> 23:35.200
Until you're so old that you don't feel that anymore.

23:36.240 --> 23:37.440
In that way sexier?

23:38.560 --> 23:39.760
Isn't that sexier?

23:39.760 --> 23:45.600
Sort of puritanical, button down, keep it under your apron type approach.

23:46.880 --> 23:49.200
Yeah, you hide it right under your bonnet.

23:49.200 --> 23:50.560
Guys, how about another Yahoo?

23:50.560 --> 23:50.880
Please.

23:50.880 --> 23:51.200
Do it.

23:51.200 --> 23:56.880
Do it. This one was sent in by Jacob Locker.

23:56.880 --> 23:58.080
Thank you, Jacob.

23:58.080 --> 24:03.200
It's by Yahoo Answers user cdmaxteambringit, who asks,

24:03.840 --> 24:06.000
how pathetic are the rock haters?

24:09.040 --> 24:11.680
Rock haters are usually mostly Cena marks,

24:11.680 --> 24:14.880
but Cena fans have no idea how good the rock was,

24:14.880 --> 24:16.800
how good the rock can still be.

24:16.800 --> 24:19.280
Everybody knows the rock is holding back,

24:19.280 --> 24:22.560
and to whoever thinks it's funny that the rock made the Tooth Fairy movie,

24:22.560 --> 24:25.520
you're dumb, because he made more money off that movie

24:25.520 --> 24:27.680
than you will ever make in your entire life.

24:28.560 --> 24:30.720
Cena hasn't been owning the rock.

24:30.720 --> 24:33.600
John Cena is nowhere near the rock's level,

24:33.600 --> 24:35.920
and the only reason that it looks like he is

24:35.920 --> 24:39.280
is because the rock is holding back to make Cena look good.

24:39.280 --> 24:42.320
Cena's jokes aren't funny, and Cena is terrible in general.

24:43.520 --> 24:46.480
Another argument rock haters have is he sold out.

24:46.480 --> 24:47.840
No, he didn't sell out.

24:47.840 --> 24:49.520
The only thing the rock sold out,

24:49.520 --> 24:51.840
the only thing the rock sold out was arenas,

24:51.840 --> 24:53.760
and he is still selling out arenas.

24:54.400 --> 24:56.560
So what if he left WWE in 2004?

24:56.560 --> 24:57.600
It's his life.

24:57.600 --> 24:59.440
Why should we tell him how to live it?

24:59.440 --> 25:00.320
Bonus question.

25:00.320 --> 25:01.280
Agree, disagree.

25:01.280 --> 25:02.800
John Cena isn't funny.

25:07.360 --> 25:08.320
Bonus question.

25:08.320 --> 25:12.480
I don't, there wasn't really a question in there anywhere.

25:14.480 --> 25:17.040
How pathetic are the rock haters is the question.

25:17.040 --> 25:18.560
Apparently very pathetic.

25:20.320 --> 25:23.120
Like, what does he want, what does he want?

25:24.080 --> 25:25.360
What does he want me to say?

25:25.360 --> 25:27.200
Okay, the rock is cool.

25:27.920 --> 25:29.440
He made more money than me.

25:29.440 --> 25:31.520
Like, he's very rich.

25:32.160 --> 25:35.680
He's very rich, and he's very, I guess he's bald now.

25:38.000 --> 25:39.600
It's a two-part question.

25:39.600 --> 25:40.240
Okay.

25:40.240 --> 25:40.720
Part one.

25:40.720 --> 25:43.520
Pathetic are the rock haters, and how, what are your,

25:43.520 --> 25:46.480
what are just your general feelings on John Cena?

25:47.200 --> 25:48.640
Okay, John Cena.

25:48.640 --> 25:49.360
Pay me a picture.

25:50.080 --> 25:51.360
John Cena has muscles.

25:51.360 --> 25:52.240
Let's get that out of the way.

25:53.280 --> 25:55.120
And he was the Marine, I think?

25:55.120 --> 25:56.000
He was in the Marine.

25:57.040 --> 26:01.280
And he, when he gets angry, or he's about to get beat,

26:01.840 --> 26:04.800
he rips off his yellow tank top,

26:04.800 --> 26:07.600
and the song I'm a Real American plays,

26:08.240 --> 26:09.920
and he goes, oh yeah, brother.

26:09.920 --> 26:11.520
He says he's a Cena maniac.

26:11.520 --> 26:13.680
I'm a Cena maniac, brother.

26:13.680 --> 26:15.120
I've got Cena-phobia.

26:15.120 --> 26:17.040
I've got Cena-phobia, bro.

26:17.040 --> 26:18.480
Well, that's probably accurate.

26:19.840 --> 26:22.880
The only thing I know about John Cena is that his,

26:22.880 --> 26:26.480
quote, wrestling costume is a t-shirt and jean shorts.

26:28.080 --> 26:29.760
Like, he just could not be bothered.

26:29.760 --> 26:32.400
That is actually the official wrestling costume

26:32.400 --> 26:36.320
of both the Stonewall Club and the New Polo Club in Huntington.

26:36.320 --> 26:39.280
So if you're ever around, and you're gonna do some wrestling there,

26:39.280 --> 26:41.840
make sure you get your cut-off jean shorts early,

26:41.840 --> 26:44.720
because most of the common sizes go quick.

26:44.720 --> 26:47.600
John Cena's original wrestling name was actually Jortsman.

26:49.760 --> 26:51.760
Or, if you will, Jortsman.

26:52.960 --> 26:53.920
He wore a mask.

26:54.960 --> 26:59.120
I'm the Jortsman, and I'm here to stuff it.

27:03.040 --> 27:03.840
Stuff what?

27:05.120 --> 27:06.320
Wrestling touchdowns?

27:06.320 --> 27:09.280
His legs, his legs in the jort holes.

27:12.320 --> 27:13.360
Check out these socks.

27:14.080 --> 27:16.000
You like how long the socks are?

27:16.560 --> 27:17.200
Stuff it!

27:19.440 --> 27:21.600
My jorts are comfortable and easy to wear.

27:23.040 --> 27:24.160
I'm web savvy.

27:24.880 --> 27:26.240
It's a meme.

27:26.240 --> 27:27.040
Oh, man.

27:29.440 --> 27:30.560
Fuck, The Rock is awesome.

27:30.560 --> 27:33.120
Has anyone seen Fast Five in this podcast?

27:33.120 --> 27:33.760
Other than me?

27:34.720 --> 27:34.960
No.

27:34.960 --> 27:35.600
No.

27:35.600 --> 27:39.760
There's a scene where The Rock and Vin Diesel just wail on each other.

27:40.640 --> 27:41.920
They just go crazy.

27:41.920 --> 27:42.880
Like romantically?

27:44.240 --> 27:46.880
There's strong romantic undertones,

27:46.880 --> 27:49.280
but it's mostly them just throwing each other through walls.

27:50.560 --> 27:51.600
And you know what?

27:51.600 --> 27:52.720
I watched that.

27:52.720 --> 27:54.160
I watched that movie ironically,

27:54.160 --> 27:56.320
but I came out with the very unironic position

27:56.320 --> 27:58.480
that The Rock is actually pretty fucking awesome.

28:00.000 --> 28:01.360
I mean, have you seen-

28:01.360 --> 28:02.320
Is it Walking Tall?

28:02.320 --> 28:05.200
Uh, I've seen both Walking Tall and The Rundown.

28:05.200 --> 28:07.840
The Rundown, now The Rundown rules.

28:07.840 --> 28:08.240
Yeah.

28:08.240 --> 28:12.400
The Rundown is a movie where the ending is actually telegraphed

28:12.400 --> 28:15.040
in the first 30 seconds of the film,

28:15.040 --> 28:20.880
because The Rock can't touch guns because bad things happen.

28:20.880 --> 28:24.400
And if you don't know how the movie ends now,

28:25.200 --> 28:27.920
then you should turn in your cinephile badge

28:27.920 --> 28:29.520
that I made you last week.

28:29.520 --> 28:31.520
Your cinephile badge?

28:31.520 --> 28:32.480
Your cinephile badge?

28:32.480 --> 28:34.080
Your cinephile badge.

28:36.640 --> 28:38.640
I don't go to the cinema.

28:38.640 --> 28:40.560
I go to the cinema.

28:40.560 --> 28:44.560
I only see movies starring John Cena.

28:45.920 --> 28:48.560
Guys, I worked in a movie theater when The Marine came out,

28:49.120 --> 28:54.000
and the number of cups, like Dixie cups,

28:54.000 --> 29:01.520
full of skull leavings would turn your stomach.

29:01.520 --> 29:02.640
Quick quiz, hotshot.

29:03.200 --> 29:07.040
Is the Cineplex a move that John Cena does,

29:07.040 --> 29:10.080
or a place where you see a lot of John Cena movies?

29:10.080 --> 29:10.720
I don't know.

29:11.600 --> 29:12.080
I don't know.

29:12.080 --> 29:13.040
It's wordplay.

29:14.080 --> 29:16.560
It's a double entendre.

29:16.560 --> 29:23.440
I often forget that the rock wrestler with hair

29:24.400 --> 29:30.640
is the same person as the bald rock that is in movies.

29:30.640 --> 29:31.520
The Balrog?

29:32.080 --> 29:35.360
The Balrog of a man that is in movies.

29:35.360 --> 29:37.040
My brain just doesn't connect them

29:37.040 --> 29:38.800
as the same entity sometimes.

29:38.800 --> 29:41.280
That's because he's Dwayne Johnson now.

29:41.280 --> 29:41.780
Right.

29:41.780 --> 29:47.300
Dwayne Johnson, which I can understand, of course,

29:47.300 --> 29:48.260
why he changed that name.

29:48.260 --> 29:49.620
It's not particularly memorable,

29:49.620 --> 29:51.700
unless you put the rock in the middle of it.

29:51.700 --> 29:54.420
His original wrestler name was actually the Dwayne.

29:56.100 --> 29:57.220
It was the Dwayne versus Georgeman.

29:57.220 --> 29:59.780
I would have started watching wrestling

29:59.780 --> 30:01.540
to become a fan of the Dwayne.

30:01.540 --> 30:03.380
I'm gonna stomp you, Georgeman.

30:03.940 --> 30:04.820
I'm the Dwayne.

30:06.340 --> 30:07.140
Make it Dwayne.

30:08.020 --> 30:09.140
I'm gonna make it Dwayne.

30:09.140 --> 30:11.220
Bring the Dwayne.

30:12.980 --> 30:15.380
I think he should have just gone for the agro crag.

30:15.380 --> 30:17.060
That's what I would have called myself.

30:17.060 --> 30:18.180
The radical rock.

30:18.180 --> 30:20.020
Come break a piece off this radical rock.

30:22.900 --> 30:23.940
Oh, the rock.

30:26.500 --> 30:29.700
Do people really get this up in arms about their wrestlers?

30:30.340 --> 30:32.100
Is this the way things are going?

30:32.100 --> 30:33.140
It's crazy.

30:33.140 --> 30:34.820
It's crazy on the streets, right?

30:34.820 --> 30:37.220
I watched Wrestlemania for the first time last year,

30:37.220 --> 30:46.180
and there were people in the audience

30:46.820 --> 30:48.980
who, when their guy lost,

30:49.620 --> 30:52.900
they would just commit seppuku right there,

30:54.100 --> 30:54.980
holding up signs.

30:55.780 --> 30:57.860
John 3.14, whatever, seppuku.

31:00.500 --> 31:01.700
I'm not kidding you.

31:01.700 --> 31:04.340
It was a fervor that I haven't seen.

31:04.340 --> 31:07.540
I mean, the Beatles have nothing on some of these guys.

31:11.700 --> 31:14.020
The only thing that I ever took away from wrestling,

31:14.020 --> 31:16.180
and I know this is just too bad

31:16.180 --> 31:17.860
because we talked about Pokemon a little bit earlier,

31:17.860 --> 31:20.500
but to me, getting upset about it

31:20.500 --> 31:24.100
is like getting upset about Pikachu losing a fight

31:24.100 --> 31:25.620
because you know what's going to happen

31:25.620 --> 31:27.300
is he's going to get angry

31:27.300 --> 31:29.620
and he's going to get his electricity back

31:29.620 --> 31:31.220
and then he's going to come back strong.

31:31.220 --> 31:34.740
Like Hulk Hogan and Pikachu

31:34.740 --> 31:36.580
are basically the same story arc.

31:38.980 --> 31:40.260
Hulk Hogan gets pinned.

31:40.260 --> 31:40.740
He's beat.

31:40.740 --> 31:41.940
He's down for the count.

31:41.940 --> 31:43.460
Then they lift his hand up

31:43.460 --> 31:47.220
and he keeps it up the third time.

31:47.220 --> 31:48.900
They drop his hand and he keeps it up

31:48.900 --> 31:50.820
because he's got America power.

31:50.820 --> 31:52.500
And he comes back and he just-

31:52.500 --> 31:54.980
He does renaissance commercials.

31:54.980 --> 31:58.660
Exactly, Travis.

31:58.660 --> 31:59.780
Exactly what I meant.

31:59.780 --> 32:02.500
Pikachu, exact same.

32:02.500 --> 32:03.300
Gets kicked around.

32:03.300 --> 32:07.700
He gets those little pound signs on his face

32:07.700 --> 32:09.620
that mean he's been beaten up.

32:09.620 --> 32:10.260
And then-

32:10.260 --> 32:12.740
He gets one big sad anime tear

32:12.740 --> 32:13.860
that appears over his head.

32:13.860 --> 32:14.580
And Ash is like,

32:14.580 --> 32:16.100
Pikachu, I don't care if you win or not.

32:16.100 --> 32:16.900
I still love you.

32:16.900 --> 32:17.620
Yeah, I still love you

32:17.620 --> 32:18.660
because we're friends forever.

32:18.660 --> 32:21.460
And then he falls into an earth's wild electric socket.

32:21.460 --> 32:23.620
And then Pikachu just murders everyone.

32:23.620 --> 32:24.660
Then just comes back and murders everyone.

32:24.660 --> 32:25.460
It's the exact same story.

32:25.460 --> 32:26.260
They're both yellow.

32:26.980 --> 32:28.020
They both have ears.

32:28.020 --> 32:30.500
Pikachu's original wrestler name was Thunder Boy

32:30.500 --> 32:31.220
with an I.

32:32.100 --> 32:32.740
Oh yeah?

32:33.620 --> 32:35.380
It was actually Thunder Boy Tellum.

32:36.660 --> 32:37.780
But he shortened it.

32:37.780 --> 32:38.740
He shortened it.

32:38.740 --> 32:40.820
Because it's a fit on t-shirts that he was selling.

32:41.380 --> 32:43.540
Hey, we can't sell t-shirts

32:43.540 --> 32:44.740
with Thunder Boy written on them.

32:45.700 --> 32:46.740
Because it's copyrighted.

32:46.740 --> 32:48.260
Because it's copyrighted.

32:48.260 --> 32:49.860
So we have to rely on the money zone.

32:49.860 --> 32:58.340
Guys, let's pull this shit into the dock of money.

32:58.340 --> 33:00.340
Oh, money dock.

33:01.380 --> 33:06.420
We have been waiting on this culmination of this campaign.

33:07.620 --> 33:09.860
Okay, five weeks ago, I want to take you back.

33:09.860 --> 33:12.260
Five weeks ago, we got an email

33:12.260 --> 33:17.460
that we were going to be promoting a product called

33:17.460 --> 33:23.140
Stack Soap and the crazy person in charge of this product,

33:23.140 --> 33:26.100
which is an infinite cycle of soap.

33:26.100 --> 33:28.340
It's a soap bar with a divot in it.

33:28.340 --> 33:31.060
So once you've used the first bar up,

33:31.060 --> 33:34.340
you can slide the remaining sliver in

33:34.340 --> 33:35.780
and it makes a whole new bar.

33:35.780 --> 33:38.420
And that cycle continues in perpetuity.

33:38.420 --> 33:41.220
When we were told by our Maximum Fun overlords

33:41.220 --> 33:43.780
that we were going to be promoting this product,

33:43.780 --> 33:46.420
and they wanted to raise $9,000,

33:46.420 --> 33:48.980
there was a part of me, I got to admit, that thought,

33:48.980 --> 33:49.940
hey, that's great.

33:49.940 --> 33:51.780
Thanks for the money, stupid.

33:51.780 --> 33:53.300
Thanks for the money, dumbo.

33:53.940 --> 33:56.820
Sorry, we're really going to give it the old college try.

33:58.820 --> 34:02.660
But sorry, there's no chance that this is going to pan out for you.

34:02.660 --> 34:06.020
And in just five short weeks, they've managed to make more

34:06.020 --> 34:09.860
goddamn money than we ever made off this show in the entire year.

34:09.860 --> 34:15.300
They managed to make more goddamn money than we ever made off this show in the entire time we've been doing it.

34:15.300 --> 34:16.900
So good on them.

34:17.620 --> 34:18.900
Good on you, Stack Soap.

34:18.900 --> 34:22.260
You've grown too powerful and we have to destroy you.

34:23.940 --> 34:27.860
$17,000 goddamn dollars.

34:29.140 --> 34:30.580
It's got to have reached a point.

34:30.580 --> 34:32.740
I don't want to stop you from going and giving more money

34:32.740 --> 34:34.500
because Eric's doing a great job

34:34.500 --> 34:36.020
and this soap thing is a brilliant idea

34:36.020 --> 34:38.100
and the Stack Soap is going to be huge.

34:38.100 --> 34:41.620
But I'm just saying, yeah, the $9,000 goes to the dye

34:41.620 --> 34:45.780
and then he could get some new fragrances and colors and stuff.

34:45.780 --> 34:47.860
Yeah, he's going to sample a lot of fragrances,

34:47.860 --> 34:50.180
which is code for do a bunch of coke.

34:51.780 --> 34:55.620
That extra $8,000 is going straight up his nose.

34:55.620 --> 34:58.740
Which, great, you know, maybe that's the kind of juice that he needs

34:58.740 --> 35:02.100
to come up with brilliant ideas like fucking Forever Soap.

35:02.100 --> 35:03.220
Yeah, Forever Soap.

35:03.220 --> 35:07.540
Well, we should come up with that instead of wasting, what is it now, 94 hours?

35:07.540 --> 35:10.100
Just palling around, talking about Pokemon.

35:10.100 --> 35:11.620
We could have been making soap.

35:11.620 --> 35:14.260
We could have made some crazy soap thing.

35:14.260 --> 35:16.340
He didn't even make fucking soap.

35:16.340 --> 35:18.980
He made a video about how he wants to make soap.

35:20.420 --> 35:21.940
He made hypothetical soap.

35:21.940 --> 35:26.340
He made fantasy soap and we gave him $17,000.

35:26.340 --> 35:28.260
He said, I have soap ideas.

35:29.780 --> 35:31.700
I have a soap concept.

35:31.700 --> 35:33.220
I want to whiteboard this with you.

35:33.780 --> 35:35.940
Please give me so much money.

35:35.940 --> 35:39.540
And meanwhile, we're talking about wrestling and Pokemon,

35:39.540 --> 35:44.340
not spending a single moment thinking of new soap-ovations.

35:44.340 --> 35:47.620
And this guy's getting rich off of it, but God bless him.

35:47.620 --> 35:48.260
God bless you.

35:48.980 --> 35:51.220
You guys are pretty fantastic people.

35:51.940 --> 35:56.820
And you have made Eric turn him into a mini mogul, I think.

35:56.820 --> 36:03.460
And he is going to use the pledges to start this line of soap.

36:03.460 --> 36:11.060
And it is not, well, depending on when you get this, it is not too late.

36:11.060 --> 36:14.500
You can still rush in for a last minute pledge.

36:14.500 --> 36:21.540
If you pledge $10 or more, you can get six bars of soaps shipped straight to you.

36:21.540 --> 36:28.980
Or you can get 12 bars for $25 and you'll be on the ground floor of something.

36:28.980 --> 36:33.060
Even if you listen to this episode in three weeks, four weeks,

36:33.060 --> 36:36.420
and you're behind and you've missed the deadline to donate,

36:36.420 --> 36:38.980
still check out Tax Soap because I think it's going to be huge.

36:38.980 --> 36:40.340
And I think people are really going to love it.

36:40.900 --> 36:43.460
And so go ahead and check it out and find out about it

36:44.020 --> 36:46.500
because you're going to want to know about it in the future, I think.

36:46.500 --> 36:48.260
Yeah, it's just taxsoap.com.

36:48.260 --> 36:53.300
And as requested, as promised, I should say,

36:54.500 --> 36:59.860
we have got a jingle that is over a month in the making.

36:59.860 --> 37:02.980
Don't fucking talk about that.

37:02.980 --> 37:08.340
And it's been something Griffin's been sort of working on in his spare time

37:08.340 --> 37:09.940
in his off hours in the basement.

37:09.940 --> 37:15.300
Five weeks, about 35 minutes of work on it.

37:16.100 --> 37:19.300
Yeah, just hours of tinkering.

37:19.300 --> 37:21.460
He just wants, sometimes he'll say like, can I hear it?

37:21.460 --> 37:23.540
And he'll be like, he's not ready.

37:23.540 --> 37:24.420
It sounds tinny.

37:24.980 --> 37:29.300
Bring up the speaker on the base.

37:29.300 --> 37:30.420
It's got hand claps.

37:30.420 --> 37:31.220
It's got bass.

37:31.220 --> 37:32.260
It's got kazoo noises.

37:32.260 --> 37:33.140
It's got layering.

37:34.260 --> 37:35.380
It's going to be amazing.

37:35.380 --> 37:38.100
So here it is.

37:38.100 --> 37:47.860
Put your soap in my soap and we'll both get clean together.

37:50.500 --> 37:52.420
Put your soap in my soap.

37:54.020 --> 37:57.940
It's got a divot for your pleasure.

37:57.940 --> 38:00.260
You've got to use Stack Soap.

38:02.660 --> 38:05.140
Don't you waste your soap away.

38:08.180 --> 38:10.340
You've got to use Stack Soap.

38:12.740 --> 38:15.220
Buy yourself some bars today.

38:20.020 --> 38:22.420
Don't let your skin get dry.

38:22.420 --> 38:25.300
Stack Soap, don't use no lye.

38:25.300 --> 38:28.100
Stack your soap into the sky.

38:30.980 --> 38:35.460
Buy yourself a little hope with Stack Soap.

38:44.900 --> 38:45.860
Stack Soap.

38:47.540 --> 38:48.580
Get yourself clean.

38:50.180 --> 38:51.300
Buy a soup bar.

38:51.300 --> 38:53.940
That's where you find it.

38:53.940 --> 38:56.580
Get it on Kickstarter.

38:56.580 --> 39:02.580
It's going to smell so fresh.

39:06.020 --> 39:06.520
Soap.

39:11.940 --> 39:12.440
Wow.

39:12.980 --> 39:13.460
I don't know.

39:14.660 --> 39:17.940
I hope I win the Grammy this year for best soap song.

39:17.940 --> 39:21.780
Griffin, I have heard some songs before.

39:22.340 --> 39:29.300
But in comparison to that, they're just random collections of beeps and boops.

39:29.300 --> 39:33.060
Yeah, everything else just sounds like audio garbage.

39:33.700 --> 39:35.300
I cried soapy tears.

39:35.300 --> 39:38.100
Yeah, it hurt really bad.

39:38.100 --> 39:42.420
I cried soapy tears because this motherfucker just made 17 grand

39:43.460 --> 39:45.140
to come up with a soap-ovation.

39:45.140 --> 39:48.740
Fun. Also, soapy tears was my favorite 1950s comedian.

39:52.500 --> 39:56.420
He's a toast of vodka now he's storming Broadway.

39:56.420 --> 39:57.620
Soapy tears.

39:58.340 --> 40:01.700
Come learn his signature dance, the scorch.

40:01.700 --> 40:03.700
Do you remember that time when soapy tears?

40:03.700 --> 40:07.300
There's a big controversy because he told kids to go in their parents wallet

40:07.300 --> 40:10.740
and email him and mail him their social security cards.

40:10.740 --> 40:14.260
Email me your social security cards.

40:14.260 --> 40:16.260
Fuck, fuck, shit.

40:16.260 --> 40:18.260
Just feed it into your gramophone.

40:20.420 --> 40:24.100
I'm more popular than Justin Bieber will be in 80 years.

40:24.100 --> 40:25.460
I'm soapy tears.

40:25.460 --> 40:28.340
Soapy tears was our nation's greatest prognosticator.

40:29.940 --> 40:31.620
Now let's all do the scorch.

40:31.620 --> 40:33.620
And it turns out that the scorch was the Dougie.

40:37.620 --> 40:38.900
Let me teach you how to scorch.

40:41.060 --> 40:41.540
Fuck.

40:41.540 --> 40:44.660
Guys, we have a new brother and sister. Did you know this?

40:46.500 --> 40:51.860
I'm worried that mom and dad Jesse and Teresa aren't going to love us as much anymore.

40:51.860 --> 40:52.340
They won't.

40:52.900 --> 40:54.660
But here's the good news.

40:54.660 --> 40:58.740
We have a new awesome hilarious podcast on the maximumfun.org network.

41:00.740 --> 41:02.500
This is just as soapy tears predicted.

41:05.540 --> 41:07.940
I thought it was just the scribblings of a bad man.

41:07.940 --> 41:12.340
He said one day an actual woman and an actual homosexual

41:12.340 --> 41:15.140
will record a podcast together about their plight

41:15.700 --> 41:17.460
and it will be called Throwing Shade.

41:17.460 --> 41:21.380
And it will edge out the love that Jesse and Teresa have.

41:21.380 --> 41:24.020
It will cut into the love of my brother, my brother and me.

41:24.820 --> 41:26.340
They will be cast aside.

41:27.060 --> 41:27.940
Not be the scorch.

41:29.780 --> 41:34.020
Travis, can you tell us a little bit more about this new program?

41:34.020 --> 41:37.380
Well, it's not a new program, but it's new to our family.

41:37.380 --> 41:44.820
Throwing Shade, they take issues that affect the female and homosexual community

41:44.820 --> 41:47.380
and treat them with less respect than they deserve.

41:49.540 --> 41:52.260
Is that a company line or is that your own?

41:52.260 --> 41:55.380
No, that's their company line. I'm not judging in any way. I love it.

41:56.180 --> 41:59.220
It can be slightly more political than you might be used to,

41:59.220 --> 42:04.340
but in episode 18, which was their first Max Fun episode,

42:04.340 --> 42:07.380
within the first like 10 minutes, Brian talks about

42:07.380 --> 42:09.780
shoehorning his soft penis into somebody's butt.

42:09.780 --> 42:12.260
With a literal shoehorn?

42:12.260 --> 42:13.540
Like with a literal shoehorn.

42:13.540 --> 42:16.180
Oh, I've got to get down on this podcast.

42:16.180 --> 42:18.100
So I highly recommend it.

42:18.100 --> 42:22.900
It's hosted by Aaron Gibson and Brian Safi and it's very funny.

42:24.420 --> 42:27.060
Everybody needs to go listen to it and show it the same

42:27.620 --> 42:31.460
love that you showed us when we so recently joined the Maximum Fun Network.

42:31.460 --> 42:35.300
I promise. I really think you guys will like it, so make sure you check it out.

42:36.660 --> 42:41.300
Yeah, it's great. And just promise you won't love them as much.

42:41.300 --> 42:44.100
Yeah, I promise you. Yeah, still love us.

42:44.100 --> 42:45.940
But love them, but mainly us.

42:45.940 --> 42:48.260
Yeah, love us more, I guess I would say.

42:49.380 --> 42:51.460
And them less, but still some.

42:51.460 --> 42:53.220
But still some, but not much.

42:54.100 --> 43:00.420
Not as much. Don't like throw us overboard like you did with the soap thing.

43:00.420 --> 43:05.300
When you describe when you decided you're going to run wild like Hulkamania on this soap concept

43:05.300 --> 43:09.060
and leave your old buddies, Justin and Griffin, without Travis.

43:10.100 --> 43:13.540
Well, I've never thought of you as like much of a soap guy.

43:13.540 --> 43:15.380
I feel like Griffin and I could be in the soap biz.

43:15.380 --> 43:16.180
I'm not sure you would.

43:17.220 --> 43:19.620
I've been a soap man since before you were born, Justin.

43:19.620 --> 43:24.260
If we get any bats in the soap factory, I'll have you come by and de-bat the place.

43:27.060 --> 43:30.100
My British friend is in her first year of med school in the US

43:30.100 --> 43:33.700
and has recently decided that she can't maintain a long distance relationship

43:33.700 --> 43:35.460
with her longtime boyfriend in the UK.

43:36.580 --> 43:40.660
Problem is that he's already booked tickets to visit her over spring break

43:40.660 --> 43:42.740
and he won't be able to get the money back.

43:42.740 --> 43:46.020
Oh, when is the right time for her to break up with him?

43:46.020 --> 43:48.500
Before, during or after the visit?

43:49.220 --> 43:52.660
She's asking me for advice and I'm at a loss would tell her help.

43:53.780 --> 43:55.700
That's from Stumpton, Cincinnati.

43:55.700 --> 43:57.860
Well, you've indirectly come to the right place.

43:57.860 --> 44:02.180
Oh man, there's so many issues here.

44:02.180 --> 44:07.860
First off, I can imagine, like it was tough enough to maintain a relationship

44:08.580 --> 44:12.740
in med school when I lived in the same places as my now wife.

44:12.740 --> 44:16.100
Like I can't imagine trying to do that long distance.

44:16.100 --> 44:19.700
Yeah, with a fucking continental divide between you, there's no way.

44:20.740 --> 44:23.620
Well, we're not telling her anything, she already doesn't know.

44:23.620 --> 44:27.860
With all the plate shifting and the tectonics.

44:27.860 --> 44:32.660
If he can't refund the ticket, you have to take,

44:32.660 --> 44:36.420
like you should have known that this wouldn't have worked before you left.

44:36.420 --> 44:40.580
So this is your punishment for not ending it before then

44:40.580 --> 44:42.900
is you have to try to keep it up.

44:43.780 --> 44:44.500
Really?

44:44.500 --> 44:44.740
No.

44:44.740 --> 44:45.220
Yeah, you do.

44:46.340 --> 44:48.260
That is patently bad advice.

44:48.260 --> 44:49.300
I disagree.

44:49.300 --> 44:54.740
I think before you got to go before so that they come and then they have the opportunity

44:54.740 --> 44:56.020
of they flying to America.

44:56.020 --> 44:58.180
They don't have to hang out with you if they don't want to.

44:59.300 --> 45:02.260
So like they still come or they say like, fuck it, I don't want to go

45:02.260 --> 45:06.660
because otherwise the other thing is if you do it during that's bad.

45:07.220 --> 45:11.060
If you do it after you've just spent like a week with this person,

45:11.060 --> 45:13.300
super awkward and totally not into them at all.

45:13.940 --> 45:15.460
Oh God, you're right.

45:15.460 --> 45:16.580
God damn it.

45:16.580 --> 45:21.940
How much a ticket from the UK to the US is how many euros?

45:23.700 --> 45:26.100
I think it's like, depending on, you know,

45:26.900 --> 45:33.060
anywhere from 600 to $1,000, I think to get round trip.

45:33.060 --> 45:34.340
So like 20 euros.

45:34.340 --> 45:36.340
So like 20 to 25 euros.

45:36.340 --> 45:37.140
Right, exactly.

45:37.140 --> 45:42.180
How I would pay $1,000 to not have to go through this.

45:44.260 --> 45:46.100
I actually think that's a good way of looking at it.

45:46.100 --> 45:48.500
Yeah, I would reimburse them.

45:48.500 --> 45:49.460
Here's a question, Griff.

45:49.460 --> 45:51.620
Do you think she should get the checkbook out

45:51.620 --> 45:53.460
and maybe try and meet him halfway on this?

45:53.460 --> 45:54.100
That's what I'm saying.

45:54.100 --> 45:58.180
It's worth to her $1,000 for her not to go through this.

45:59.060 --> 46:01.860
Okay, so she should say like, hold on, let me cover that for you.

46:01.860 --> 46:04.980
Yeah, let me go ahead and get that tick and talk to you never.

46:06.500 --> 46:07.700
Oh man, that's brutal.

46:08.260 --> 46:10.420
Yeah, because if you tell them in advance enough,

46:11.060 --> 46:12.900
maybe he could sell it on Craigslist or something.

46:12.900 --> 46:14.100
Do they have Craigslist there?

46:14.100 --> 46:15.780
Of course they do, they have to.

46:15.780 --> 46:17.380
Sell it on Craigslist or something.

46:17.380 --> 46:18.820
Sell it on Lord's Craigslist.

46:20.900 --> 46:22.660
The Craigslist of Davenshire.

46:24.100 --> 46:25.700
Yeah, you guys are right.

46:25.700 --> 46:28.420
I was in the wrong at the beginning of this.

46:30.340 --> 46:31.460
You can't go through with this.

46:31.460 --> 46:32.100
Here's the thing.

46:32.100 --> 46:34.500
What you're probably trying to solve,

46:34.500 --> 46:38.660
person asking this question, is the good way to do it.

46:38.660 --> 46:40.420
There is no good way to do it.

46:40.420 --> 46:44.340
No, that's the thing is like you could contort yourself

46:44.340 --> 46:47.700
into something that you think is the most decent, right?

46:47.700 --> 46:49.460
Like it's probably the most decent to,

46:49.460 --> 46:52.500
depending on how long term this relationship is,

46:52.500 --> 46:55.860
it's probably the most decent to like end it face to face, right?

46:55.860 --> 46:58.580
But at the same time, you could kill yourself

46:58.580 --> 47:00.740
to try to make that happen.

47:00.740 --> 47:05.300
But in the end, it's still gonna be the dude got dumped.

47:05.300 --> 47:06.740
I mean, he's not gonna think that.

47:06.740 --> 47:09.540
Got dumped in a foreign country while he stuck with you

47:09.540 --> 47:11.860
with like no other mode of transportation

47:11.860 --> 47:14.100
or place to hang out or anywhere to go.

47:14.100 --> 47:15.380
He can't be away from you.

47:16.740 --> 47:18.660
And you are gonna tell him before he makes the trip.

47:18.660 --> 47:22.740
You are going to permanently injure his opinion of America.

47:23.380 --> 47:25.380
If you do that, whenever he thinks of America,

47:25.380 --> 47:26.980
he's gonna think of the heartbreak.

47:26.980 --> 47:28.180
And we don't need more bad press.

47:28.180 --> 47:29.460
Heartbreak in the heartlands.

47:29.460 --> 47:31.860
I want people to think of hamburgers and John Cena.

47:32.980 --> 47:34.340
And Cena burgers.

47:34.340 --> 47:37.060
Like if you tell him that he shouldn't come,

47:37.620 --> 47:40.740
then he really shouldn't have any problem.

47:40.740 --> 47:44.100
I mean, like basically isn't a ticket to America

47:44.100 --> 47:46.500
like the most valuable thing you can get?

47:46.500 --> 47:48.020
Like there are people in Mexico

47:48.020 --> 47:49.300
that would kill for a ticket to America.

47:49.300 --> 47:49.700
Yeah, right?

47:50.740 --> 47:53.060
It's like a fucking Willy Wonka golden ticket.

47:53.060 --> 47:55.620
Right, you come over here, we're gonna get you set up.

47:55.620 --> 47:58.420
We're gonna take you to the Cenaplex and we're gonna-

47:59.300 --> 48:00.820
We're gonna eat Cena burgers.

48:00.820 --> 48:02.820
I imagine Cena burgers come,

48:02.820 --> 48:05.300
it's two burgers that come in a pair of jorts.

48:07.060 --> 48:09.140
Like a Happy Meal, but instead of a box.

48:09.140 --> 48:10.660
Those jorts are made of french fries?

48:10.660 --> 48:12.820
Sure, if we want to go there.

48:12.820 --> 48:15.220
They would lose the gene quality.

48:16.820 --> 48:18.580
They're dyed blue, they're made of blue corn.

48:18.580 --> 48:19.940
Blue corn french fries.

48:19.940 --> 48:21.380
I just want you guys to know that in my mind,

48:21.380 --> 48:23.220
as we've been talking about John Cena,

48:23.220 --> 48:26.420
I've been pronouncing it in my head as John Zena

48:26.420 --> 48:27.620
and it makes me a lot happier.

48:27.620 --> 48:28.820
Okay, you can do it.

48:28.820 --> 48:30.180
Sure, you can go down that.

48:30.180 --> 48:30.420
Yeah.

48:30.420 --> 48:31.540
Go down that blind alley.

48:32.180 --> 48:33.700
I feel like we've helped this person enough.

48:33.700 --> 48:35.140
Can we jump to a Yahoo?

48:35.140 --> 48:37.540
Yeah, yeah, we helped him like a wicked lot.

48:38.100 --> 48:39.460
This one was sent in by Jacob Locker.

48:39.460 --> 48:40.020
Thank you, Jacob.

48:40.020 --> 48:42.420
It's by Yahoo Answers user Marcus who asks,

48:43.060 --> 48:45.940
is it true that the Olive Garden is for poor people?

48:48.180 --> 48:50.100
My girlfriend said it was

48:50.100 --> 48:51.540
and didn't want us to go there last night.

48:51.540 --> 48:53.620
She's a rich girl and knows what fine food is,

48:53.620 --> 48:58.980
but we've never even ever been in there before.

48:58.980 --> 49:01.540
So how does she know it is such a low quality place?

49:06.100 --> 49:07.860
This is a sticky subject.

49:07.860 --> 49:10.660
Yeah, Justin, didn't you sign an NDA

49:10.660 --> 49:12.420
when you stopped working at the Olive Garden?

49:12.420 --> 49:16.580
Yeah, as a former line chef at the Olive Garden,

49:16.580 --> 49:18.660
I think I might have to recuse myself from this question

49:18.660 --> 49:24.740
because I can't say anything negative about the OG.

49:26.900 --> 49:29.860
For an entire three and a half weeks, that was my home.

49:29.860 --> 49:33.860
Can I just say that as somebody who shared a house with you

49:33.860 --> 49:36.020
while you were an OG line cook,

49:36.020 --> 49:38.420
whenever you came home from that job,

49:38.420 --> 49:40.740
you kind of smelled like a poor person.

49:40.740 --> 49:42.820
I did.

49:42.820 --> 49:48.740
I got soaked in what was colloquially referred to as OG water,

49:48.740 --> 49:52.100
which was the, nevermind, I don't want to ruin the Olive Garden.

49:52.100 --> 49:54.420
Tell me the OG water story today.

49:56.420 --> 49:58.420
Well, at the end of the night,

49:58.420 --> 50:02.260
the floor was coated in squished garlic and noodles

50:02.260 --> 50:03.860
that had fallen to the ground.

50:03.860 --> 50:06.020
So you would have to get on your hands and knees

50:06.020 --> 50:07.380
and hose off the floor.

50:07.380 --> 50:09.940
Why did you have to get on your hands and knees to do it?

50:09.940 --> 50:13.060
Well, to get underneath the breadstick oven.

50:14.100 --> 50:16.660
So you would spray the floor off

50:16.660 --> 50:19.060
and you would get kind of soaked in OG water.

50:19.060 --> 50:20.580
Oh, fuck.

50:20.580 --> 50:25.620
And your whole clothes would smell like hobo garlic.

50:25.620 --> 50:27.380
And it was a nightmare.

50:27.380 --> 50:31.700
I would say that if eating pounds and pounds

50:31.700 --> 50:34.500
of unlimited breadsticks and bottomless pasta pits

50:34.500 --> 50:37.380
is for poor people, I don't want to be rich.

50:37.380 --> 50:38.340
Amen.

50:38.340 --> 50:40.660
I did that gross thing that I just described

50:40.660 --> 50:42.740
and you put a plate of chicken scampi in front of me,

50:42.740 --> 50:44.340
you better believe I'm going to town.

50:44.340 --> 50:45.220
That's what I'm saying.

50:45.220 --> 50:46.580
Gonna hurt that bad boy.

50:46.580 --> 50:49.940
Just gonna carb up, face the day.

50:49.940 --> 50:50.980
Take a run.

50:50.980 --> 50:53.300
But mathematically speaking, though,

50:53.300 --> 50:58.580
the Olive Garden offers you infinite food for like $3.25.

50:58.580 --> 51:00.500
So yes, I would say mathematically,

51:00.500 --> 51:02.340
I would say mathematically speaking,

51:02.340 --> 51:05.300
it is indeed ideal for poor people.

51:05.300 --> 51:06.020
Right.

51:06.020 --> 51:08.420
It's a pretty sweet scene for the poor folk.

51:09.220 --> 51:11.060
It's for the people who are too uppity

51:11.060 --> 51:13.220
to eat the pasta at Golden Corral.

51:13.220 --> 51:14.100
Right, exactly.

51:14.100 --> 51:19.460
And they think too much of themselves to get down on some,

51:19.460 --> 51:20.340
what do they have there?

51:20.340 --> 51:21.380
Like beef on a hook.

51:22.900 --> 51:24.500
They don't want to eat the hook beef.

51:24.500 --> 51:26.900
No, you just gnaw on it with a bunch of people.

51:26.900 --> 51:31.460
Pulling up to the Golden Corral.

51:31.460 --> 51:33.860
Darrell, make me a spot on the beef hook.

51:35.140 --> 51:37.780
You cover it with a nondescript gray sauce.

51:40.100 --> 51:45.140
Yahoo answers user coconut guy responded.

51:45.700 --> 51:48.420
Olive Garden are for all kinds of people.

51:48.420 --> 51:50.740
Everyone with all sorts of different incomes

51:50.740 --> 51:52.500
go there and dine to enjoy

51:52.500 --> 51:54.340
and just have a good time eating there.

51:54.340 --> 51:56.740
Hope that helps.

51:57.620 --> 51:59.220
Oh, it helps tremendously.

51:59.220 --> 52:01.060
It's such a big help.

52:01.940 --> 52:04.180
They go there, they dine to enjoy.

52:04.820 --> 52:05.540
Come.

52:05.540 --> 52:05.860
Nobody.

52:05.860 --> 52:07.940
You know who I bet eats at the Olive Garden?

52:09.060 --> 52:10.500
Dwayne The Rock Johnson.

52:10.500 --> 52:11.700
Bet he's not too big.

52:11.700 --> 52:12.740
Not too proud.

52:12.740 --> 52:14.180
Well, he's too big to fit through the door.

52:14.180 --> 52:15.540
They have to like feed him outside,

52:15.540 --> 52:17.620
but he's a man of the people.

52:18.500 --> 52:20.740
I got some of the people's pasta on the people's elbow.

52:20.740 --> 52:24.260
I have a few problems with this guy's response.

52:24.260 --> 52:25.700
Okay.

52:25.700 --> 52:26.980
The most glaring of which being that

52:26.980 --> 52:30.100
I don't think anyone has ever gone to the Olive Garden

52:30.100 --> 52:31.940
to quote, have a good time eating there.

52:32.580 --> 52:33.540
I think they go there

52:33.540 --> 52:35.700
because they want to make a pasta mistake.

52:38.100 --> 52:39.540
Or more likely,

52:39.540 --> 52:42.260
it's the only place you can get your grandparents to go.

52:42.900 --> 52:43.460
Yeah.

52:43.460 --> 52:45.700
That's the only place they love is the Olive Gardens.

52:45.700 --> 52:46.820
You go there with them.

52:46.820 --> 52:48.340
Hey, Pap Pap and Gam Gam,

52:48.340 --> 52:49.620
remember the old country?

52:49.620 --> 52:50.740
This is basically like that.

52:50.740 --> 52:52.420
Let's go get endless breadsticks.

52:52.420 --> 52:54.340
Let's go eat pasta until we die.

52:54.340 --> 52:55.140
And then, but don't worry,

52:55.140 --> 52:56.420
because they have wine you can drink

52:56.420 --> 52:57.620
to forget the pasta pain.

52:59.220 --> 53:02.100
Anytime that I've ever gone to Olive Garden

53:02.100 --> 53:03.860
that hasn't been prompted by family,

53:03.860 --> 53:04.820
it's always been,

53:05.620 --> 53:07.140
I've always done carry out.

53:07.140 --> 53:08.580
Like, I don't want anybody to know.

53:08.580 --> 53:11.780
I'll slip in there in my jorts and a mask

53:11.780 --> 53:17.460
and just get a big bag of pasta and leave.

53:17.460 --> 53:18.660
The mental image.

53:19.380 --> 53:21.060
Like, I still pay for it.

53:21.060 --> 53:22.580
It's not like a robbery.

53:22.580 --> 53:23.860
It's a pasta robbery.

53:23.860 --> 53:24.820
When you said mask,

53:24.820 --> 53:27.380
I imagined like a feathered masquerade mask.

53:27.380 --> 53:29.460
See, I picture a luchadora mask.

53:30.420 --> 53:32.020
I wish it was that dramatic.

53:33.940 --> 53:34.900
No, it's just, you know,

53:34.900 --> 53:39.380
like a regular inside out William Shatner mask on Halloween.

53:40.340 --> 53:41.620
Something for the kids.

53:41.620 --> 53:42.820
Keep things lively.

53:42.820 --> 53:45.860
But I think that if you get to a point

53:46.820 --> 53:50.100
where you, I don't think any restaurant is like,

53:50.100 --> 53:52.020
like, oh, I'm not going to go there

53:52.020 --> 53:53.060
because it's only for poor people.

53:53.060 --> 53:54.820
Like, I think that's kind of despicable.

53:54.820 --> 53:56.580
And if I try to make those barriers for myself

53:56.580 --> 53:58.340
living in Huntington, West Virginia,

53:58.340 --> 54:00.500
I would not be able to eat out a lot,

54:00.500 --> 54:03.460
which for the health spectrum

54:03.460 --> 54:05.620
might not be the worst thing in the world.

54:05.620 --> 54:07.620
But I think that the important thing

54:07.620 --> 54:11.140
is just to know sort of where that restaurant fits

54:11.940 --> 54:13.220
in the world.

54:13.220 --> 54:15.300
Like, sort of like, what is the level of,

54:16.660 --> 54:18.340
you know, what is the level of food here?

54:18.340 --> 54:20.820
What is the level of quality you're opening yourself up to?

54:21.460 --> 54:23.940
And sort of like, where does that fit?

54:23.940 --> 54:26.980
What's the Zagats on Olive Garden?

54:26.980 --> 54:27.780
Did you Yelp it?

54:28.500 --> 54:29.700
Did you Yelp this OG?

54:30.980 --> 54:33.300
I would say this, just as a last piece of advice.

54:34.420 --> 54:38.660
I do not necessarily daily crave the Olive Garden.

54:38.660 --> 54:40.180
But if I was dating a girl who,

54:40.180 --> 54:41.620
when I brought up the Olive Garden,

54:41.620 --> 54:43.220
said that's for poor people,

54:43.940 --> 54:46.100
I would immediately dump her.

54:46.100 --> 54:48.580
It is not a good relationship you're in, sir.

54:49.380 --> 54:51.220
That restaurant, that's for the rabble.

54:52.100 --> 54:53.460
That's for the commoners?

54:54.020 --> 54:55.380
I'd rather go to Denny's.

54:55.380 --> 54:57.860
I only eat at the spaghetti factory.

54:57.860 --> 54:59.780
Are there any restaurants, be honest,

54:59.780 --> 55:01.780
are there any restaurants that you guys won't go to

55:01.780 --> 55:03.380
because it's just too low quality?

55:03.380 --> 55:03.860
Nope.

55:03.860 --> 55:05.460
The food's for poor people.

55:05.460 --> 55:07.380
You know me too well to ask that.

55:07.380 --> 55:08.500
The answer is nope.

55:09.860 --> 55:12.660
In fact, if they have large quantities of food for very cheap,

55:12.660 --> 55:14.340
like, I mean, I'll go to CC's Pizza.

55:14.340 --> 55:17.220
I ain't above it.

55:17.220 --> 55:19.460
Just to take things a little serious for a second,

55:19.460 --> 55:20.580
but not too serious,

55:20.580 --> 55:21.780
because we'll come up the other end.

55:22.980 --> 55:26.100
The last time that we all went to Golden Corral

55:26.100 --> 55:30.420
was the first Christmas Eve after our mother passed away.

55:30.420 --> 55:33.300
We decided that's the time we've got to get in there

55:33.300 --> 55:34.740
and not on the beef hook.

55:34.740 --> 55:39.380
That's going to turn us around on Christmas.

55:39.380 --> 55:41.460
We were like, we'll go out to dinner for Christmas

55:41.460 --> 55:44.340
and didn't think of the fact that it's fucking Christmas

55:44.340 --> 55:47.220
and everybody in their right mind is closed.

55:47.220 --> 55:48.180
Like, everybody's closed,

55:48.180 --> 55:50.180
so there's one place that's open.

55:50.180 --> 55:52.100
Motherfucking Golden Corral.

55:52.100 --> 55:52.980
Well, don't worry, guys,

55:52.980 --> 55:56.260
because it was the closest restaurant to the cemetery

55:56.260 --> 55:57.220
we had just visited.

55:57.220 --> 55:57.860
Oh, God, no.

55:57.860 --> 55:59.540
Pretty good choice, Golden Corral.

56:00.100 --> 56:02.580
How much does this restaurant cost to eat at?

56:02.580 --> 56:03.460
Everything.

56:03.460 --> 56:05.380
Do you want to know the saddest part?

56:05.380 --> 56:07.380
We weren't the only ones there.

56:07.380 --> 56:08.500
Oh, whatever.

56:08.500 --> 56:10.180
That beach was full of people.

56:10.180 --> 56:13.140
It was full of people getting their holiday nosh on.

56:13.140 --> 56:15.860
None of them were quite as in good spirits as us.

56:16.500 --> 56:17.940
Nobody made eye contact.

56:17.940 --> 56:19.140
Nobody made eye contact.

56:20.180 --> 56:22.420
But you could tell the holiday magic was there

56:22.420 --> 56:24.660
because a boy would come up to the beef hook

56:24.660 --> 56:27.220
and a man would like scoot over a little bit.

56:27.220 --> 56:28.180
Come on, Junior.

56:28.740 --> 56:29.460
Come on.

56:29.460 --> 56:30.660
Get on in here.

56:30.660 --> 56:31.700
Wash your hands.

56:31.700 --> 56:33.620
I've already gotten through the pre-gristle.

56:35.220 --> 56:36.900
Really tuck into the meat.

56:36.900 --> 56:38.340
All those boys over there,

56:38.340 --> 56:40.100
they just made a terrible life choice.

56:41.860 --> 56:43.940
They probably could have made spaghetti at home or something.

56:44.980 --> 56:46.500
Just slosh your sauce.

56:46.500 --> 56:48.100
Encounter blessings.

56:48.100 --> 56:48.900
And do the squirge.

56:52.900 --> 56:53.860
Oh, man.

56:53.860 --> 56:59.780
I wonder if Soapy Tears saw that depressing, depressing shit

56:59.780 --> 57:00.340
we were going to do.

57:00.340 --> 57:04.740
It was so depressing that he knew back in the 50s

57:04.740 --> 57:06.100
that we were going to do it.

57:06.100 --> 57:07.700
He predicted the existence of Olive Garden

57:07.700 --> 57:11.300
thanks to our depressing, terrible choices.

57:11.300 --> 57:14.500
That's the thing about being in a depressing situation, guys.

57:14.500 --> 57:15.220
And remember this.

57:16.420 --> 57:18.500
Most of the time, you could have avoided it.

57:18.500 --> 57:19.620
No matter what the depress-

57:19.620 --> 57:20.900
It's all your fault.

57:20.900 --> 57:21.860
It's all your fault.

57:21.860 --> 57:24.900
You went to England, you flew over from England

57:24.900 --> 57:26.180
and your girlfriend depressed you

57:26.180 --> 57:28.900
and you're walking around all sad like that one scene

57:28.900 --> 57:31.380
in Ernest Goes to Camp where he-

57:31.380 --> 57:32.580
He's crying in the window.

57:32.580 --> 57:33.460
Crying in the window.

57:33.460 --> 57:35.700
Yeah, you could have avoided it

57:35.700 --> 57:38.340
if you just asked her like, are you feeling like you maybe

57:38.340 --> 57:39.780
want to break out with us?

57:39.780 --> 57:42.580
Just so I know before I purchase this very expensive,

57:42.580 --> 57:44.180
non-refundable ticket.

57:44.180 --> 57:45.380
We're good, right?

57:45.380 --> 57:45.860
We're good.

57:46.500 --> 57:47.380
I feel like we're good.

57:48.580 --> 57:49.700
Well, that is our show.

57:51.220 --> 57:54.020
Thank you guys so much for listening again.

57:54.020 --> 57:56.100
This has been, what, 95 episodes?

57:56.100 --> 57:57.060
Ah, fuck.

57:57.060 --> 57:58.340
We better figure something out.

57:59.140 --> 58:03.540
Gotta do something big for our Hundo episode.

58:03.540 --> 58:05.620
But seriously, no BS.

58:06.180 --> 58:08.820
Thank you guys so much for being with us.

58:08.820 --> 58:12.660
You're the most supportive, coolest, funniest community

58:12.660 --> 58:14.900
of people on the entire internet

58:14.900 --> 58:18.020
and you make every day worthwhile.

58:19.140 --> 58:21.700
Thank you for supporting Stacked Soap

58:21.700 --> 58:23.780
even though I think you might have overdone a little bit.

58:23.780 --> 58:26.020
Thank you for creating the soap juggernaut.

58:26.020 --> 58:28.180
This soap, this new force in soap.

58:29.780 --> 58:30.660
Something we don't talk about a lot,

58:30.660 --> 58:31.860
we got a Facebook group.

58:31.860 --> 58:34.180
If you go to Facebook, search for My Brother and My Brother and Me,

58:34.900 --> 58:38.260
you'll see thousands of people talking about the show,

58:40.340 --> 58:44.180
swapping pictures, goofy observations, zingers.

58:45.460 --> 58:46.900
That's all going on there.

58:46.900 --> 58:48.740
So go join up to that group.

58:48.740 --> 58:52.820
And if you join, you have to be hand approved by me, Travis, or Griffin

58:52.820 --> 58:54.180
so you know that it's like...

58:54.180 --> 58:55.380
So bask in it.

58:55.380 --> 58:56.100
Bask in it.

58:56.100 --> 58:57.140
Meaningful and special.

58:57.140 --> 58:58.100
Also, it's coming up.

58:58.100 --> 58:59.380
It's that time of year.

58:59.380 --> 59:02.900
Coming up is our MaximumFun.org fun drive.

59:03.860 --> 59:08.180
And once a year, we're going to put out some extra long episodes,

59:08.740 --> 59:12.100
give you a chance to help support all the MaxFun shows that you love.

59:12.100 --> 59:15.060
We're going to be giving away extra content,

59:15.700 --> 59:17.940
some gifts and stuff if you donate.

59:17.940 --> 59:19.060
It's going to be a good time.

59:19.060 --> 59:20.020
So make sure you check it out.

59:20.020 --> 59:22.660
I think that starts the 26th, March 26th.

59:22.660 --> 59:23.060
Yeah.

59:23.060 --> 59:23.220
Yeah?

59:23.220 --> 59:23.780
Yeah.

59:23.780 --> 59:24.020
Yeah.

59:24.020 --> 59:25.700
And then runs for two weeks.

59:25.700 --> 59:29.620
So make sure to get on board and help support the shows that you love.

59:29.620 --> 59:32.260
If you don't want to wait for that, you can go to MaxFunStore.com

59:32.260 --> 59:33.780
and we got t-shirts there.

59:33.780 --> 59:35.940
Two different styles that you can buy.

59:37.300 --> 59:42.420
We got the blue, cool, sort of Hardy Boys, Vertigo inspired,

59:42.420 --> 59:43.620
My Brother, My Brother, Me t-shirt,

59:43.620 --> 59:46.980
and there's a Peabam's Nasty Gum shirt that you can get.

59:47.620 --> 59:49.620
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters

59:49.620 --> 59:51.060
for the use of our theme song, It's a Departure,

59:51.060 --> 59:52.580
off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

59:52.580 --> 59:55.620
Just go get, just go get it, go get it.

59:55.620 --> 59:57.460
And no, we're telling you to buy a lot of things this week,

59:57.460 --> 01:00:00.500
but it's, it is imperative that you get.

01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:02.980
Also, if you have some soap that you would like to hock

01:00:02.980 --> 01:00:06.020
or any other soap related ideas,

01:00:06.020 --> 01:00:08.020
then you too can have a Jumbotron on the show

01:00:08.020 --> 01:00:09.060
and have us talk about your product

01:00:09.060 --> 01:00:10.900
or wish somebody like happy birthday

01:00:10.900 --> 01:00:12.740
or congratulations on something.

01:00:12.740 --> 01:00:16.340
Just go to Maximumfun.org slash Jumbotron

01:00:16.340 --> 01:00:17.460
and follow the steps there.

01:00:17.460 --> 01:00:19.300
And you can have a message on our show

01:00:19.300 --> 01:00:20.660
or any other Max Fun show.

01:00:20.660 --> 01:00:23.220

It's bit.ly forward slash it's MBMBAM.

01:01:01.300 --> 01:01:02.980
That's a great way to sort of spread the word

01:01:03.620 --> 01:01:04.260
about the show.

01:01:05.780 --> 01:01:08.420
This final Yahoo answer was sent in by Keith Marnock.

01:01:08.420 --> 01:01:09.060
Thank you, Keith.

01:01:09.780 --> 01:01:12.420
It's about Yahoo Answers user, Janney, who asked,

01:01:12.420 --> 01:01:17.460
What does an owl look like and why?

01:01:22.100 --> 01:01:22.980
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:01:22.980 --> 01:01:24.500
I'm Griffin McElroy.

01:01:24.500 --> 01:01:25.860
It's been my brother, my brother and me.

01:01:25.860 --> 01:01:26.500
Kiss your dad.

01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:44.900
Score on the lips.
