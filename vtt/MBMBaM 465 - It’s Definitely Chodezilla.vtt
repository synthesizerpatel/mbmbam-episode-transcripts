00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.640 --> 00:47.840
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother, my brother, mean advice show for the modern era.

00:47.840 --> 00:54.000
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. And I, as always, am your middlest brother,

00:54.000 --> 00:58.160
Travis McElroy. Yeah, it's Griffin.

00:58.160 --> 01:00.800
And you're probably wondering how Griffin got here.

01:01.360 --> 01:07.280
God stepped on a dang bear trap again. Folks, bad news. Kind of a slow start

01:08.000 --> 01:12.640
to the summer blockbuster season. Men in Black International disappoints.

01:13.920 --> 01:19.360
So far, it's pulled in 32 domestic, 73 milo. That's not a lot.

01:19.360 --> 01:20.960
That's not a lot. No, that's not a lot.

01:20.960 --> 01:25.200
That's not a production budget of 110 milo. Of course, you got to remember,

01:25.200 --> 01:30.880
50% of that is going to go back to the studios. They got to clear 220 just to kind of get a

01:30.880 --> 01:34.880
little green. How's Dark Fino doing?

01:35.760 --> 01:42.240
Dark Fino, big disappointment. We're talking about, so far,

01:42.240 --> 01:49.040
205 milo domestic on an unknown budget, but probably high.

01:49.040 --> 01:55.520
What about Godzilla? Godzilla got nothing, no dollars. It's a huge disappointment.

01:55.520 --> 02:00.160
Big stinker, stinky. It's not out for two more days, but Toy Story 4,

02:00.160 --> 02:04.240
I'm going to go ahead and call it. Shit sales. No tickets.

02:04.240 --> 02:07.440
We're tired of it. Tired of it. Are they toys? Are they people?

02:07.440 --> 02:11.120
Do they have souls? Are they ghosts? Do they make love? What's the deal?

02:11.120 --> 02:13.760
We're tired of it. We just want to be done with them.

02:13.760 --> 02:16.560
We thought we were done with them. Rocket Man's okay.

02:16.560 --> 02:22.480
Rocket Man's doing okay. 66 milo on a 40 milo budget.

02:22.480 --> 02:25.520
Blasting off. Not great, but blasting off.

02:25.520 --> 02:29.680
How's J-Wick 3? J-Wick 3, of course, huge sales.

02:29.680 --> 02:32.960
Everyone's crazy about J-Wick 3. Are movies done?

02:32.960 --> 02:36.400
Are movies done? Well, not yet, Trav, because we have good news.

02:36.400 --> 02:44.400
We, the box office doctors, Dr. B.O. They call us Dr. B.O.

02:44.400 --> 02:46.960
And we're here to bring it home. And we don't like it. Let's be clear.

02:46.960 --> 02:48.880
We find that name mean. We do not like that name.

02:48.880 --> 02:54.720
It's hasteless. It's a tasteless name, but we are here to try to save.

02:54.720 --> 02:58.000
I just want to, we want to save this movie going season.

02:58.000 --> 03:02.240
Avengers, it did fine. That made a lot of money.

03:02.240 --> 03:08.160
I want to fire up this year in movie making

03:08.160 --> 03:10.800
to get some real big grosses in the theater.

03:10.800 --> 03:13.840
I'm going to hit you guys with this, Avengers Endgame 2.

03:13.840 --> 03:18.000
What is that? What does that look like when they make that one, Travis?

03:18.000 --> 03:20.400
Oh, what would that movie look like? Yeah, tell me now.

03:20.400 --> 03:24.160
I have a pitch, but I want to pitch you guys on this.

03:24.160 --> 03:29.920
All the heroes die. A bunch of regular ass people died.

03:29.920 --> 03:34.080
And the movie skips over that. What Avengers Endgame 2

03:34.080 --> 03:37.840
has the bravery to say is, let's luxuriate.

03:37.840 --> 03:42.000
Let's just enjoy the lack of lines at Target.

03:42.000 --> 03:47.360
Let's get down deep into the Luckmire and see what it's like

03:47.360 --> 03:52.960
when all those people die for a bit. Avengers Endgame 2 is about the benefits.

03:52.960 --> 03:56.240
If the lines are shorter at Target, that's more time for drama.

03:56.240 --> 03:58.800
And that's all I'm saying is that you don't have to have,

03:58.800 --> 04:02.560
you know how every movie has 20 minute long scenes

04:02.560 --> 04:08.800
where people are in line at Target? This movie has the courage to skip those

04:08.800 --> 04:12.160
and just give you more of the character action you crave.

04:12.160 --> 04:16.720
Aladdin, what if you made a cartoon of that one?

04:16.720 --> 04:19.520
Sure. Let's get it out there.

04:19.520 --> 04:23.200
I have a pitch for kind of a different take on Godzilla.

04:23.200 --> 04:27.760
See, everybody makes that thunder lizard real big, right?

04:27.760 --> 04:33.040
Real tall, but what if he was real wide? Okay.

04:33.040 --> 04:37.280
So this is the wide Godzilla. Instead of being like 100 feet tall

04:37.280 --> 04:41.360
and 20 feet wide, he's 20 feet tall and 100 feet wide.

04:41.360 --> 04:43.600
I'm not saying round. I'm not saying round.

04:43.600 --> 04:45.920
And let me step in here because I've already, Travis,

04:45.920 --> 04:48.240
I've got the marketing team on the phone and they are saying,

04:48.240 --> 04:50.560
what is it? Are you sure?

04:50.560 --> 04:53.760
Are you absolutely certain? Okay.

04:55.040 --> 04:58.240
Chodezilla. I don't think so.

04:58.240 --> 05:00.800
And I don't think so. I don't think so.

05:00.800 --> 05:03.600
Yeah, but that's what they came up with down in marketing.

05:03.600 --> 05:06.800
Yeah, down market. Maybe I misheard it because I get weird static.

05:06.800 --> 05:08.560
I'm no, it's definitely Chodezilla.

05:12.880 --> 05:15.280
Yeah, that's pretty good. I like Godzilla.

05:16.560 --> 05:21.200
Chodezilla. The load is wide. The coast is searched.

05:21.200 --> 05:23.120
Yeah, pretty good. Pretty good.

05:23.840 --> 05:25.840
Actually, wait. No, the marketing team didn't like that.

05:26.800 --> 05:27.600
They didn't like that. Yeah.

05:27.600 --> 05:29.120
They think it clashes with Chodezilla.

05:29.120 --> 05:31.200
I don't even know what that means. I don't think words can clash.

05:32.400 --> 05:36.080
I have another one too because they just brought out Shaft.

05:36.080 --> 05:37.840
Another Shaft. Okay.

05:38.480 --> 05:40.240
Maybe instead, another Shrek.

05:41.520 --> 05:44.080
Shrek 2. I think it's time for us to finally do it.

05:44.080 --> 05:47.680
What's he been doing in the swamp? Who's he dating?

05:48.320 --> 05:50.960
I think we might be on Shrek 8 at this point.

05:51.520 --> 05:53.840
No, I know. This is the reboot of Shrek 2.

05:54.400 --> 05:56.880
Travis. They were going to reboot Shrek 1.

05:56.880 --> 05:59.680
And I called him and I said, it's the perfect movie.

05:59.680 --> 06:03.120
Eddie Murphy, Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz,

06:03.120 --> 06:05.920
and the third rock guy, Lothgau is in it.

06:05.920 --> 06:09.680
He's got the heat and it's got a dragon and the dance scene

06:09.680 --> 06:11.440
and Puss in Boots is in too.

06:12.240 --> 06:13.680
That's where it stopped making sense for me.

06:14.400 --> 06:17.200
So we're going to reboot 2. No Puss in Boots in this one.

06:17.200 --> 06:23.920
Just a lot of Shrek and Fiona kissing for long periods of time.

06:23.920 --> 06:26.160
Then they do wait in the target line for a little bit

06:26.160 --> 06:27.680
and then it's just right back to kissing

06:27.680 --> 06:29.440
while Donkey says things like,

06:29.440 --> 06:33.920
hey guys, the movie's going, should we be having

06:33.920 --> 06:36.960
some sort of dragon adventure or shoot, you're still kissing.

06:36.960 --> 06:38.880
Can I hit you with you?

06:38.880 --> 06:40.800
Travis, I want to hit you with something that you're going to love.

06:40.800 --> 06:41.760
Please don't. That would hurt.

06:42.720 --> 06:52.480
Rocketman 2, except it's a sequel to the 1997 Rocketman

06:52.480 --> 06:54.000
starring Harlan Williams now.

06:54.000 --> 06:58.480
But it's released so closely to the other one,

06:58.480 --> 07:01.440
people are going to assume, and maybe for the trailer

07:01.440 --> 07:04.080
you play a little bit of Elton John music.

07:04.960 --> 07:06.160
Oh, that's great.

07:06.720 --> 07:11.040
We could also just take the original cut of Rocketman

07:11.040 --> 07:13.760
and maybe remaster it a bit, take it to Weta

07:13.760 --> 07:15.680
and get them to touch it up here and there

07:15.680 --> 07:18.240
and we play all the Elton John songs over it.

07:18.240 --> 07:19.920
So we could have Goodbye Yellow Brick Road

07:19.920 --> 07:21.920
in that one scene where he farts so much

07:21.920 --> 07:23.760
that his space suit explodes.

07:24.400 --> 07:24.800
Yes.

07:24.800 --> 07:28.160
Or we could do, oh, you know, be funny as if it was like

07:28.160 --> 07:30.960
a candle in the breaking wind so we could have him

07:30.960 --> 07:32.160
do parody stuff.

07:32.160 --> 07:34.720
How about people in black?

07:35.440 --> 07:36.240
Pib.

07:36.240 --> 07:37.040
That could be fun.

07:38.080 --> 07:41.280
Or people in whatever.

07:41.280 --> 07:42.400
People in clothes.

07:43.120 --> 07:43.440
Yes.

07:44.240 --> 07:46.240
That's people in clothes is great.

07:46.240 --> 07:49.040
But we can't do any nudes in that one.

07:49.040 --> 07:50.080
No, not yet.

07:50.080 --> 07:52.880
You saved that for number two and you call it

07:52.880 --> 07:55.520
People in Clothes Tudes.

07:55.520 --> 07:57.920
And it's the number two, D-E, Tude.

07:58.720 --> 08:05.200
And then that's the sequel where there's explicit nudity.

08:06.080 --> 08:09.200
Pokemon Bus Driver Pikachu.

08:09.200 --> 08:09.760
Okay.

08:09.760 --> 08:13.440
You can put any job in there and just make it different.

08:13.440 --> 08:15.200
He doesn't have to be a detective.

08:15.200 --> 08:17.040
Pokemon Assassin Pikachu.

08:18.880 --> 08:20.640
That's what the games are basically.

08:20.640 --> 08:23.280
Oh, who just cracked him up a cold one?

08:23.280 --> 08:26.720
Pokemon Sewage Treatment Pikachu.

08:26.720 --> 08:29.040
Someone's trying to enjoy suds and buds.

08:29.040 --> 08:30.640
Who's that cracking one?

08:33.200 --> 08:34.480
It's a...

08:34.480 --> 08:37.040
Oh, cracking a BL orange.

08:37.040 --> 08:37.920
Yeah, dude.

08:37.920 --> 08:39.200
We can't have this.

08:39.200 --> 08:40.960
That's what I call Hollywood fuel.

08:40.960 --> 08:43.440
That's what keeps the wheels spinning, baby.

08:44.160 --> 08:46.960
It's a Coca-Cola Zero Orange Vanilla.

08:46.960 --> 08:47.280
Nice.

08:48.800 --> 08:49.360
I've got it.

08:49.360 --> 08:52.640
A prequel Pokemon Unemployed Pikachu.

08:53.440 --> 08:54.400
Stop it.

08:54.400 --> 08:56.880
And it's just Pikachu going through the one ends,

08:56.880 --> 08:58.880
going in for interviews,

08:58.880 --> 09:02.000
not quite making it through the interview

09:02.000 --> 09:03.520
because he is a Pokemon.

09:04.640 --> 09:07.440
Hey guys, at what point there...

09:07.440 --> 09:08.880
I want to go inside the bit.

09:08.880 --> 09:11.840
At what point during this bit did you pivot from

09:11.840 --> 09:15.200
this is going pretty good to we've never been funny

09:15.200 --> 09:16.480
and we'll never be funny again.

09:16.480 --> 09:16.960
I'm not there yet.

09:16.960 --> 09:18.000
Because that's sort of the...

09:18.000 --> 09:18.880
You're not there yet.

09:18.880 --> 09:21.440
Because that is sort of the panic that I'm experiencing

09:21.440 --> 09:24.400
over on this end that did prompt me to pop up in a cold one.

09:24.400 --> 09:26.480
See if I can reinvigorate the brain cells

09:26.480 --> 09:28.240
with a little bit of Coke Zero.

09:28.240 --> 09:28.960
How about...

09:28.960 --> 09:30.000
I've got it.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.200
Guys, I've got it.

09:31.200 --> 09:33.600
Two popular movies that could be more popular.

09:34.480 --> 09:35.520
Okay, you ready for this?

09:35.520 --> 09:36.000
I call it...

09:36.000 --> 09:36.800
Thank God for you.

09:36.800 --> 09:37.600
Book Dumbo.

09:38.400 --> 09:42.400
Inability to see within and to see without.

09:42.400 --> 09:45.360
See, instead of book smart, they're book dumb.

09:45.360 --> 09:48.800
But also instead of... Because then they're applying elephant

09:48.800 --> 09:50.000
who like three books.

09:50.000 --> 09:53.920
I'm all ego over here.

09:53.920 --> 09:56.560
I'm all deep within my own consciousness,

09:57.360 --> 10:00.720
contemplating my irrelevance as I, you know,

10:00.720 --> 10:01.840
hurdle towards 40.

10:02.960 --> 10:05.200
I feel like my best work is behind me and Travis...

10:05.200 --> 10:06.320
Sha-yam.

10:06.320 --> 10:09.440
And it's about a yam with magic powers.

10:09.440 --> 10:11.760
Oh my God, Justin, they're getting worse, man.

10:13.520 --> 10:14.560
See, now I'm in...

10:14.560 --> 10:16.720
I'm in Carvel and it's about an ice cream store

10:16.720 --> 10:18.080
that's also a superhero.

10:18.720 --> 10:20.080
He's brought me back in.

10:21.040 --> 10:23.840
How do I get my coworkers to genuinely leave me alone

10:23.840 --> 10:25.760
before I've had my morning coffee?

10:26.320 --> 10:26.820
How do I...

10:29.120 --> 10:31.600
How do I ask them to back off

10:31.600 --> 10:34.560
and tell them I had a good 300 milligrams of caffeine in me

10:34.560 --> 10:36.400
without sounding like an overused caption

10:36.400 --> 10:37.680
on a corporate coffee cup?

10:37.680 --> 10:40.960
And that's from Cranky Coffee Consumer in Colorado.

10:41.760 --> 10:42.960
That's gotta be tough, right?

10:42.960 --> 10:45.440
Because if you're like, hey, please just leave me alone.

10:45.440 --> 10:46.800
I haven't had my coffee.

10:46.800 --> 10:48.640
Oh, the nice one.

10:48.640 --> 10:49.440
Yeah, I get it.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.920
So anyways, what did you do last night?

10:51.920 --> 10:55.200
It's like, no, I really hate you.

10:55.200 --> 10:56.080
Please don't.

10:56.080 --> 10:57.600
I need this to talk to you.

10:58.560 --> 11:01.440
You've gotta start having your coffee earlier.

11:01.440 --> 11:02.160
This is good.

11:02.160 --> 11:03.120
You can't.

11:03.120 --> 11:05.760
You gotta be up before anybody.

11:05.760 --> 11:06.960
You can't risk this.

11:06.960 --> 11:09.680
This is apparently a very real situation for you.

11:09.680 --> 11:11.280
You have to be up at four in the morning,

11:11.280 --> 11:12.960
cranking beans.

11:12.960 --> 11:14.240
Well, but Justin, there you are,

11:14.240 --> 11:15.200
cranking those beans,

11:15.200 --> 11:17.120
and somebody's just gonna get into your house

11:17.120 --> 11:19.360
to talk to you before that happens.

11:19.360 --> 11:21.360
They smell the beans are grinding

11:21.360 --> 11:23.840
and they're like, they smash into the window.

11:23.840 --> 11:26.000
Pretty soon they'll start talking to you the night before.

11:27.120 --> 11:28.000
You know what I mean?

11:28.000 --> 11:29.600
And then what, Justin?

11:29.600 --> 11:31.600
You're just gonna crank your beans in bed

11:31.600 --> 11:32.800
in front of God and everybody?

11:33.920 --> 11:34.800
Come on.

11:34.800 --> 11:35.600
What a mess.

11:35.600 --> 11:37.440
Tell me where I can crank my beans.

11:38.160 --> 11:40.880
I don't even know if it's safe to crank your beans these days

11:40.880 --> 11:41.840
in this economy?

11:42.560 --> 11:46.000
What's great about this is it's a self-fulfilling idea.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.320
Because if you do start saying to your coworkers

11:48.320 --> 11:50.080
any sort of amalgamation of,

11:50.080 --> 11:52.960
please don't, I can't with you right now, Barbara,

11:52.960 --> 11:57.440
because I haven't had my good brown bean juice yet.

11:57.440 --> 11:59.200
There's a beverage that I have to have

11:59.200 --> 12:00.880
in order for me to even listen

12:00.880 --> 12:02.960
to the dumb shit you say every day.

12:02.960 --> 12:05.920
If you say that to a person, great news,

12:05.920 --> 12:07.920
they'll never come talk to you again

12:07.920 --> 12:09.520
if you have your coffee or don't.

12:09.520 --> 12:12.480
You will be the mean office person, so.

12:12.480 --> 12:14.720
You can have your coffee for the luxury of your home

12:14.720 --> 12:16.080
because you will be unemployed.

12:17.680 --> 12:19.840
Yeah, just get the coffee sooner.

12:19.840 --> 12:20.800
I really don't know.

12:21.440 --> 12:26.480
You can't value people less than a good hot bean juice.

12:26.480 --> 12:27.200
You know what I mean?

12:27.200 --> 12:28.080
It seems rude.

12:28.800 --> 12:30.080
What you have to communicate to them

12:30.080 --> 12:34.560
is you're showing them respect and caring and nurturing

12:35.280 --> 12:39.120
by saving them from you pre-bean juice.

12:39.120 --> 12:39.620
That's correct.

12:40.320 --> 12:41.200
Does that make sense?

12:42.000 --> 12:43.600
You have to take care of yourself

12:44.400 --> 12:46.400
before you can take care of other people.

12:46.400 --> 12:48.640
If you want to be an efficient caregiver

12:48.640 --> 12:49.760
in any sort of setting,

12:51.440 --> 12:55.520
you have to have achieved your coffee earlier than that.

12:55.520 --> 12:58.160
I wake up before everyone in my house

12:58.160 --> 13:01.920
and the first thing I do is start drinking coffee

13:02.880 --> 13:04.400
is the first thing I do.

13:04.400 --> 13:07.600
So when they wake up, they don't know that man,

13:07.600 --> 13:10.720
that lonely man that walks the halls

13:10.720 --> 13:14.400
and lurks in the shadows because they never meet him.

13:15.280 --> 13:19.120
He's only up from 645 to 655 while he makes his job.

13:19.120 --> 13:20.640
That's the fussy man.

13:20.640 --> 13:24.080
We don't talk about the fussy man in this household.

13:24.080 --> 13:25.440
We don't speak of the fussy man.

13:26.400 --> 13:27.760
Nobody ever goes in.

13:28.880 --> 13:30.720
I think you could play that out even more

13:30.720 --> 13:32.640
and just build up a whole like,

13:33.360 --> 13:35.840
tell your co-workers like, I'd love to stop and talk,

13:35.840 --> 13:38.400
but I have to take this coffee to go kill the fussy man

13:38.960 --> 13:39.760
and then leave.

13:39.760 --> 13:42.000
Do you want to make an appointment with me

13:42.720 --> 13:44.480
or do you want to talk to the fussy man?

13:44.480 --> 13:44.800
That's it.

13:44.800 --> 13:48.400
Because he is here currently and he's got my office.

13:48.400 --> 13:50.000
I have an idea.

13:50.000 --> 13:50.400
Okay.

13:50.400 --> 13:52.000
Do you want to hear an idea?

13:52.000 --> 13:52.320
Yes.

13:52.880 --> 13:54.640
You put a sign up that says,

13:54.640 --> 13:57.200
this cubicle or office or whatever it is

13:58.320 --> 14:02.320
has been entered into a co-working office sharing program.

14:02.320 --> 14:08.240
I will be, I, Dylan, who everybody knows and loves,

14:08.240 --> 14:10.400
will be sharing an office with a man named Gustav

14:10.400 --> 14:12.080
who does not understand our business

14:12.880 --> 14:15.760
and it's not to be shared proprietary information

14:15.760 --> 14:16.400
with Gustav.

14:17.200 --> 14:20.000
Then every morning when you go to work,

14:20.880 --> 14:24.880
you have a kind of festive bowler and maybe a monocle

14:24.880 --> 14:26.560
and some sort of mustache.

14:26.560 --> 14:28.320
I don't know exactly the getup.

14:28.320 --> 14:30.320
It's got to be something you could apply every day.

14:30.320 --> 14:33.360
Some spirit glue and a Gustav, a little bit of spirit.

14:33.360 --> 14:34.960
A Gustav skin mask.

14:35.840 --> 14:36.560
Something.

14:36.560 --> 14:38.240
Yeah, you see Mission Impossible.

14:38.240 --> 14:43.200
And anyway, Gustav, he has, he is the one who drinks the coffee.

14:43.200 --> 14:44.960
He's the one that coffee is gone.

14:44.960 --> 14:46.000
He loves coffee.

14:46.000 --> 14:46.480
Right.

14:46.480 --> 14:47.600
Yes, yes.

14:47.600 --> 14:50.960
He's a coffee taster, is what he does for a living.

14:50.960 --> 14:53.200
He's using this co-working thing to get out of the house.

14:54.080 --> 14:58.560
After he's done, he goes into a broom closet and dies.

14:58.560 --> 15:02.960
And dies every day.

15:02.960 --> 15:04.400
And then who comes out?

15:04.400 --> 15:07.440
It's you looking fresh and ready for the day.

15:07.440 --> 15:09.440
And you've killed Gustav again.

15:09.440 --> 15:13.120
Until Gustav climbs back into your body while you're asleep.

15:13.680 --> 15:14.800
Shit, Gustav.

15:15.840 --> 15:17.760
Gustav's such a messy little fuck.

15:18.880 --> 15:20.080
I love him.

15:20.080 --> 15:22.240
What happens when your co-workers and your boss

15:22.240 --> 15:23.760
start to like Gustav better?

15:24.640 --> 15:26.480
That is a huge, they're not going to.

15:26.480 --> 15:27.760
He's a fucking dick.

15:27.760 --> 15:28.640
But you know what?

15:28.640 --> 15:31.920
People like that bad boy sometimes, Justin.

15:31.920 --> 15:33.280
Ah, dude.

15:33.280 --> 15:36.240
If people like the bad boy, your problem is solved.

15:36.240 --> 15:38.640
They love you no matter what.

15:38.640 --> 15:39.140
Yeah.

15:40.320 --> 15:42.160
Get on some Maxtrum shit.

15:43.120 --> 15:45.200
You could do like I do when people try to talk to me

15:45.200 --> 15:46.880
about serious stuff before I've had coffee

15:46.880 --> 15:48.400
and just cry a little bit.

15:49.600 --> 15:51.840
Just cry a little bit and then they'll probably

15:51.840 --> 15:53.280
go find something else to do.

15:53.280 --> 15:53.600
Yeah.

15:53.600 --> 15:55.920
Tell them you're having a really hard time right now.

15:55.920 --> 15:58.240
It's probably true.

15:58.240 --> 15:59.120
Do you want a Yahoo?

15:59.680 --> 16:00.560
Yes, please.

16:00.560 --> 16:01.920
I got one sent in by Emily.

16:01.920 --> 16:02.480
Thanks, Emily.

16:02.480 --> 16:05.200
It's Yahoo Answers user Sayana who asks,

16:06.880 --> 16:08.800
what's your weed whacking style like?

16:09.440 --> 16:10.160
Whoa.

16:10.160 --> 16:12.640
Do you use barely enough gas to cut the weeds?

16:12.640 --> 16:16.240
Or are you one of those people that really goes for it?

16:17.520 --> 16:18.020
Huh.

16:18.800 --> 16:21.440
You know, I've never really thought about it before,

16:21.440 --> 16:23.440
but I guess mine's pretty whimsical.

16:23.440 --> 16:26.400
Oh, yeah, I would say so.

16:26.400 --> 16:26.800
I would say so.

16:26.800 --> 16:29.440
I like to stand in one place and kind of swing around

16:29.440 --> 16:33.280
in a circle to kind of, I like to make hairs.

16:34.160 --> 16:34.960
This is my thing.

16:34.960 --> 16:36.080
Don't tell anybody, okay?

16:36.720 --> 16:39.840
I like to make patterns in the yard that make it look

16:39.840 --> 16:41.840
like aliens have landed.

16:41.840 --> 16:44.000
I like to cut Spiderman in my yard.

16:44.000 --> 16:44.500
Nice.

16:45.120 --> 16:46.880
How much gasoline do you use?

16:48.640 --> 16:49.280
Six.

16:49.280 --> 16:49.840
Six or seven.

16:49.840 --> 16:50.800
Oh, really?

16:50.800 --> 16:51.300
Yeah.

16:51.300 --> 16:53.220
Oh, man, I have to get some tips from you.

16:53.220 --> 16:55.220
I usually use like 12 and a half.

16:56.420 --> 16:58.340
Yeah, well, I only do half the yard.

16:58.340 --> 17:01.460
The rest, yeah, the Spiderman is a pretty light lift.

17:01.460 --> 17:03.460
Just what's your weed whacking style?

17:03.940 --> 17:04.900
I have a boy.

17:05.540 --> 17:06.040
You what?

17:06.820 --> 17:07.620
I have a boy.

17:08.580 --> 17:09.860
Like a neighborhood youth?

17:10.820 --> 17:12.900
A neighborhood youth, okay.

17:13.620 --> 17:15.060
I have a boy for that job.

17:15.620 --> 17:17.700
How do you contact a boy when you need him?

17:18.500 --> 17:19.620
He's there when I need him.

17:19.620 --> 17:20.900
He's there when I need him?

17:20.900 --> 17:21.540
He just knows?

17:21.540 --> 17:23.940
He checks the weeds.

17:24.500 --> 17:29.620
He says, Dr. McElroy, I haven't told him a lot about my life.

17:29.620 --> 17:32.580
I need to keep him at a distance because I don't trust him.

17:32.580 --> 17:37.540
And he says, Dr. McElroy, your weeds are in need of whacking.

17:37.540 --> 17:39.860
I say, well, boy, you know the cure for that?

17:39.860 --> 17:40.900
You know the prescription?

17:41.460 --> 17:42.180
Here's $3.

17:43.620 --> 17:45.220
And then the boy whacks the weeds for me.

17:45.220 --> 17:45.860
Not in this.

17:45.860 --> 17:47.380
No, Justin.

17:47.380 --> 17:50.420
You have a lawn mower, right?

17:50.420 --> 17:51.540
You have a lawn mower.

17:51.540 --> 17:53.140
What's the weed whacker for?

17:53.140 --> 17:54.260
For weeds.

17:54.260 --> 17:54.820
Really?

17:54.820 --> 17:55.780
Drama.

17:55.780 --> 17:56.420
Drama.

17:56.420 --> 17:56.900
That's it.

17:59.700 --> 18:02.100
It's for drama and to sell filament.

18:02.100 --> 18:02.740
That's it.

18:03.860 --> 18:04.420
That's it.

18:04.420 --> 18:08.340
People want to get down and chop their dirt up and kill some worms

18:08.340 --> 18:10.500
because it's a perversion.

18:10.500 --> 18:15.380
And I let the boy treat his dark passenger to some worm murder.

18:15.380 --> 18:17.140
He makes $3 off the deal.

18:17.140 --> 18:19.460
And I never have to hear about this business ever again.

18:19.460 --> 18:21.540
It's got to be more than $3, though, right, Juice?

18:22.260 --> 18:22.820
Four.

18:22.820 --> 18:23.460
Fine.

18:23.460 --> 18:23.940
Yes.

18:23.940 --> 18:24.660
OK.

18:24.660 --> 18:25.060
Fine.

18:25.060 --> 18:25.620
Yes.

18:25.620 --> 18:26.020
All right.

18:26.580 --> 18:27.860
Two ghosts.

18:27.860 --> 18:31.140
Where's the third one to tell me about how I need to give more

18:31.700 --> 18:33.220
dollars to the weed whacking boy?

18:35.700 --> 18:37.460
I'll buy his family a turkey.

18:37.460 --> 18:38.740
How's that sound?

18:38.740 --> 18:39.940
Let him whack that turkey.

18:40.580 --> 18:42.180
I'm going to get myself a goat.

18:42.180 --> 18:42.900
Pay him $3.

18:43.620 --> 18:46.980
Justin, this neighborhood youth, what would you say his weed whacking style is?

18:46.980 --> 18:47.780
The weed boy.

18:47.780 --> 18:48.500
The weed boy.

18:48.500 --> 18:51.380
What is his sort of what's his weed whacking style?

18:51.380 --> 18:55.460
If I have to spend a single second contemplating weeds,

18:55.460 --> 19:00.260
and I'm including this time here, then the $3 is wasted.

19:01.060 --> 19:05.700
I never want to think about weeds and their need to be whacked again ever.

19:05.700 --> 19:11.940
And I have the luxury of the boy who comes to my house to whack the weeds for me.

19:11.940 --> 19:13.860
You can't even give him a fiber, Justin.

19:13.860 --> 19:15.780
You'd rather make change?

19:15.780 --> 19:17.140
I know you, Justin.

19:17.140 --> 19:18.820
I know your soul.

19:18.820 --> 19:21.140
I've seen the fucking dark heart of you.

19:21.140 --> 19:24.740
And I know the anxiety that dwells within you because it's in my blood, too.

19:24.740 --> 19:26.100
It's in all our blood.

19:26.100 --> 19:30.260
So I know that you have definitely had the thought of how much do I pay this person for

19:30.260 --> 19:32.100
doing a task I don't want to do?

19:32.100 --> 19:35.140
And I know you well enough to know that your brain didn't bounce to,

19:35.140 --> 19:36.260
eh, $3 seems fine.

19:36.260 --> 19:37.220
It probably bounced to-

19:37.220 --> 19:39.060
$3 the first time, that's what he asked for.

19:39.060 --> 19:42.420
If I had offered him $4 the next time, he would assume that every time he did it,

19:42.420 --> 19:44.180
he was going to make an extra dollar.

19:44.180 --> 19:49.940
Flash forward to, you know, 2020 where I'm shelling out 30 to 40 grand per weed whacking.

19:49.940 --> 19:51.300
I've done the math.

19:51.300 --> 19:53.780
The boy gets $3 or he whacks no weeds.

19:54.500 --> 19:56.260
How old is- how old would you estimate?

19:56.980 --> 19:58.340
He's a boy, Griffin.

19:58.980 --> 19:59.300
Okay.

20:00.260 --> 20:01.620
He has not- he's not a man.

20:01.620 --> 20:03.620
He doesn't have the strength to bring me down.

20:03.620 --> 20:05.220
He doesn't have the strength to destroy me.

20:05.220 --> 20:07.780
When he becomes a weed man, will you pay him more?

20:08.660 --> 20:11.140
He will be dismissed summarily.

20:11.140 --> 20:20.500
I need my- I need my lawn tended to by the starry-eyed naivete of a child.

20:20.500 --> 20:23.700
With the care and precision that only a child can offer.

20:23.700 --> 20:29.860
A weed- a weed man is going to be too busy thinking about his sexual escapades.

20:29.860 --> 20:31.620
And his weed taxes.

20:31.620 --> 20:34.100
His next drink, his weed taxes.

20:34.100 --> 20:38.180
But the boy, to him, his entire world is my weeds.

20:38.180 --> 20:44.900
Because to him, they're a bright, shiny new comic book or soda phosphate.

20:44.900 --> 20:46.820
You know, whatever boys spend their money on.

20:46.820 --> 20:49.380
Yeah, three quarters of a pack of Pokemon cards.

20:49.380 --> 20:52.740
It may not be the same boy every time.

20:52.740 --> 20:57.060
I would have no way of knowing about the weed boy.

20:57.060 --> 20:59.540
You don't have his information for a W2?

20:59.540 --> 21:00.980
How on earth?

21:00.980 --> 21:04.500
I can't even summon him to whack weeds if I need him.

21:04.500 --> 21:07.300
I don't have a- I don't have a light on top of the house.

21:07.300 --> 21:11.060
On top of the house that I flick on that looks like weeds.

21:11.060 --> 21:11.620
Not yet.

21:11.620 --> 21:13.700
He just comes when I need him.

21:13.700 --> 21:15.140
Alright, asked and answered.

21:17.300 --> 21:18.660
My birthday is today.

21:18.660 --> 21:19.060
Happy birthday.

21:19.060 --> 21:20.020
And I wanted to go out-

21:20.020 --> 21:20.820
Happy birthday.

21:20.820 --> 21:24.020
I wanted to go out to lunch with some of my co-workers to celebrate.

21:24.020 --> 21:25.860
Because it was during the middle of the week.

21:25.860 --> 21:28.420
Many people brought their lunch and couldn't come.

21:28.420 --> 21:30.500
So the group was very small.

21:30.500 --> 21:32.100
And just people I work closely with.

21:32.100 --> 21:32.740
Which was fine.

21:32.740 --> 21:37.220
But one of my co-workers who couldn't come dropped what I believe to be

21:37.220 --> 21:39.460
some backhanded advice later that afternoon.

21:39.460 --> 21:42.500
He said, my birthday is coming up soon too.

21:42.500 --> 21:45.300
About a week out I start letting people know about it.

21:46.020 --> 21:50.260
It seems very cocky and forward to me to tell people it's my birthday

21:50.260 --> 21:52.100
and provoke the attention it brings.

21:52.100 --> 21:53.620
I never liked having to do that.

21:53.620 --> 21:55.140
But he brings up a good point.

21:55.140 --> 21:57.540
How do I let people know about my birthday coming up

21:57.540 --> 22:01.700
so they can go to lunch with us and not sound like a narcissist?

22:01.700 --> 22:05.140
It's all about me and Tennessee.

22:05.140 --> 22:08.340
Just take your birthday out of the equation entirely.

22:08.340 --> 22:09.140
Sup y'all?

22:09.140 --> 22:09.780
Outback.

22:09.780 --> 22:10.820
Next Wednesday.

22:10.820 --> 22:11.460
Get there.

22:11.460 --> 22:12.260
Blooming.

22:12.260 --> 22:12.820
Onion.

22:12.820 --> 22:13.940
Big steak.

22:13.940 --> 22:14.820
Tall beer.

22:14.820 --> 22:17.540
Let's do this fucking thing Wednesday 12 o'clock.

22:17.540 --> 22:18.420
Route 60.

22:18.420 --> 22:18.900
Fucking be there.

22:18.900 --> 22:22.420
But Dave Griffith, the feeling of your co-workers when you get there

22:22.420 --> 22:25.300
and you're like, oh by the way, it's my birthday.

22:25.300 --> 22:26.980
And they're like, oh you got me.

22:27.540 --> 22:28.820
They're gonna feel tricked.

22:28.820 --> 22:31.380
They can just say lunch is on us and move on with it.

22:31.380 --> 22:32.820
Like, do you just?

22:33.540 --> 22:39.540
Because the alternative is guess whose big day is coming on Wednesday?

22:39.540 --> 22:40.740
It's Ricky.

22:41.300 --> 22:41.860
That's me.

22:42.500 --> 22:43.940
That's exactly what I do.

22:45.540 --> 22:46.900
This is the thing.

22:46.900 --> 22:49.620
I was gonna go completely the other direction with this question

22:49.620 --> 22:54.500
that only now I'm trying to think is this perhaps, you know, because of me.

22:54.500 --> 22:58.260
Then I would sit there and be like, hey everybody, it's my birthday next week.

22:58.260 --> 22:59.620
What are you gonna do for me?

22:59.620 --> 23:03.540
What are you planning to make me feel like the special boy I am?

23:04.100 --> 23:05.380
You need a middle person.

23:05.380 --> 23:10.180
You need to have someone who is following all your dark machinations

23:10.900 --> 23:12.660
and someone who will get the word out

23:12.660 --> 23:17.300
but has that like that one layer removed where it's not crass.

23:17.300 --> 23:18.980
Like you're probably, here's a perfect thing.

23:18.980 --> 23:21.140
You probably have a brother who has the same birthday as you

23:21.140 --> 23:22.420
but different years.

23:22.420 --> 23:28.260
So if the two of you exchange that, like Travis and I, for example.

23:28.260 --> 23:29.380
Oh yeah, right.

23:29.380 --> 23:32.020
Like a lot of people, we're two people who have the same birthday.

23:32.020 --> 23:34.660
I would just sort of, and we worked at the same office.

23:34.660 --> 23:37.140
Maybe it sold rubber bands.

23:37.140 --> 23:39.380
Oh, I'm so deep in this story.

23:39.940 --> 23:42.100
Yeah, and I would tell people-

23:42.100 --> 23:45.940
Just so I know, we're looking to expand into orthodontia rubber bands

23:45.940 --> 23:50.180
just to make it clear, like we're trying to merge with another company

23:50.180 --> 23:52.020
that maybe Griffin works at that sells orthodontia.

23:52.020 --> 23:53.060
Can I work here too?

23:53.060 --> 23:54.180
I want to be in this fun role play.

23:54.180 --> 23:55.860
You don't work in our office.

23:55.860 --> 23:58.980
Do you want to be in the rubber band department or the gun department?

23:58.980 --> 23:59.700
Good question.

24:00.900 --> 24:01.940
I'll do guns.

24:01.940 --> 24:02.900
I'll do guns.

24:02.900 --> 24:06.500
Okay, you can be over in the gun annex or gun X, as we call it.

24:07.220 --> 24:07.620
Okay.

24:07.620 --> 24:09.860
It's not funny, but you need a little bit of, you know

24:09.860 --> 24:13.060
you're looking for any levity you can find when you're working that rat race.

24:14.740 --> 24:16.020
So anyway, you have your brother-

24:16.020 --> 24:16.820
What's our boss like?

24:16.820 --> 24:18.980
What is the boss like?

24:18.980 --> 24:22.020
Does he say embarrassing things to embarrass you sometimes?

24:22.660 --> 24:24.500
Would you say that your boss gets it?

24:25.380 --> 24:25.940
Good question.

24:25.940 --> 24:29.460
Our boss is Chris Christie, former mayor, governor of New Jersey.

24:29.460 --> 24:30.420
So he does run.

24:30.420 --> 24:31.220
No then.

24:31.220 --> 24:32.820
No is the answer then.

24:32.820 --> 24:33.860
No is the answer.

24:33.860 --> 24:35.300
Do we hate our jobs?

24:35.300 --> 24:37.060
What's my upper mobility like?

24:37.940 --> 24:39.140
We don't love them.

24:39.140 --> 24:42.100
I mean, the nice thing is there is upper mobility

24:42.100 --> 24:45.460
but it almost always requires you to switch from either the rubber band department

24:45.460 --> 24:46.420
or the gun department.

24:46.420 --> 24:51.940
Could I lobby the board of directors to fire Chris Christie and replace me as boss?

24:53.460 --> 24:54.740
You can try anything.

24:54.740 --> 24:58.820
You can try anything Travis, but these are way back to,

24:58.820 --> 25:00.980
these are like old school gum band guys.

25:00.980 --> 25:03.540
You know, they've been in the biz for forever.

25:03.540 --> 25:10.820
They're not gonna be fooled by some young upstart with visions of guns and rubber band futures.

25:10.820 --> 25:14.100
I have a big page though Justin about how we can score the big account.

25:15.300 --> 25:16.340
How would you make-

25:16.340 --> 25:17.620
The Cracker Barrel account.

25:18.500 --> 25:19.380
Here's the problem.

25:19.380 --> 25:20.740
I have two announcements.

25:20.740 --> 25:23.700
One, Travis's birthday is next week.

25:23.700 --> 25:24.820
Let's all do something.

25:25.380 --> 25:28.500
And then Trav, didn't you have, you had something you wanted to mention?

25:28.500 --> 25:31.860
I have a plan for the big account and how we're going to get it.

25:31.860 --> 25:36.580
But only if we fire that piece of shit and hire this guy as the boss.

25:36.580 --> 25:38.660
Did you have anything else Travis you wanted to do?

25:38.660 --> 25:43.860
And when you do that, I'm going to shoot these rubber bands right into the 21st century.

25:43.860 --> 25:48.820
Hey guys, it's me Crevin and oh, can I do, I'm in a role play.

25:49.620 --> 25:51.620
Travis had one thing, one other thing.

25:51.620 --> 25:54.580
So okay, I'll step back, I'll step- It's my birthday next week, don't forget.

25:54.580 --> 25:55.540
Crevin will wait his turn.

25:56.100 --> 25:57.300
No, you go ahead Crevin.

25:58.420 --> 25:59.700
Yeah, I just made a new gun.

26:01.300 --> 26:05.620
Yeah, the shape is really cool because you can throw it right down into a sewer drain

26:06.260 --> 26:08.020
and it will fit right in there.

26:08.020 --> 26:11.220
Now it's still a gun that fires only rubber bands, right Crevin?

26:11.780 --> 26:13.940
Oh, was that shit?

26:15.940 --> 26:17.140
That's Crevin.

26:17.140 --> 26:18.820
And then the title card will pop up.

26:18.820 --> 26:22.420
Oh, listen, shut up, listen.

26:22.420 --> 26:25.300
Everybody, Travis, are you sure you didn't have anything else?

26:25.300 --> 26:27.540
Oh yeah, somebody ate my yogurt.

26:28.260 --> 26:32.980
Okay, how do we make millennials buy rubber bands?

26:32.980 --> 26:34.820
Hey, don't look away from me.

26:35.380 --> 26:36.660
Do you fucking eat my yogurt?

26:37.540 --> 26:38.180
No.

26:38.180 --> 26:38.500
Chris?

26:39.460 --> 26:39.940
No.

26:39.940 --> 26:40.340
Chris?

26:41.220 --> 26:41.860
Okay, yeah.

26:41.860 --> 26:42.740
You're fired.

26:43.620 --> 26:46.020
You can't do that, you don't have the authority.

26:46.020 --> 26:49.620
Oh, don't I? And then I'm going to shoot a rubber band at him.

26:49.620 --> 26:50.020
Uh-oh.

26:51.300 --> 26:53.780
I'll hoist it by my own gun band.

26:53.780 --> 26:54.420
You're fired.

26:54.420 --> 26:56.180
Hey, listen, it's me, Justin.

26:56.180 --> 26:58.340
I have a question for everybody at the meeting.

26:58.900 --> 27:00.260
There's seven or eight of us now.

27:00.980 --> 27:04.420
How do we make the millennials start buying rubber bands?

27:04.420 --> 27:09.860
And I want to know everyone, you had two weeks to put together a presentation

27:09.860 --> 27:12.180
for how to make millennials buy rubber bands.

27:12.180 --> 27:14.900
Travis, you asked to go first.

27:14.900 --> 27:18.900
You said you would make everybody, I'm looking at the memo you sent me.

27:18.900 --> 27:21.700
You said that your presentation would make everyone,

27:22.900 --> 27:26.660
everyone else's presentations, quote, look like the feudal ravings of a madman.

27:26.660 --> 27:27.220
Correct.

27:27.220 --> 27:29.220
And they should just burn them in a fire right now.

27:29.220 --> 27:32.180
Travis, how are you going to make the millennials buy rubber bands?

27:32.180 --> 27:36.900
Edible rubber bands that you get inside a tiny house.

27:38.980 --> 27:41.620
So you have to buy the house in order to get the gum candy?

27:41.620 --> 27:48.100
Yes, or you buy the gummy rubber bands and then you get a tiny house if you buy enough.

27:48.100 --> 27:49.620
I call them rubber band points.

27:50.180 --> 27:53.140
You gotta use those rubber band points to earn a tiny house.

27:53.140 --> 27:54.260
That's pretty good shit.

27:55.300 --> 27:56.820
That's way better than my idea.

27:56.820 --> 27:57.620
I don't even want to say my idea.

27:57.620 --> 27:58.660
What was yours?

27:58.660 --> 27:59.860
No, it was so bad.

27:59.860 --> 28:02.180
Griffin, you were, Trevon, Trevon.

28:02.180 --> 28:03.060
Wait, who's Trevon?

28:03.700 --> 28:05.220
Is Trevon related to Crevon?

28:06.180 --> 28:08.420
Crevon, Trevon's brother, Crevon.

28:08.420 --> 28:12.260
Hey, isn't it both your birthdays coming up pretty soon?

28:12.260 --> 28:15.460
Crevon, how are you going to make the millennials buy rubber bands?

28:15.460 --> 28:16.340
It's so stupid.

28:16.340 --> 28:17.540
I don't even want to say it.

28:17.540 --> 28:19.220
Say it or you're fired.

28:19.220 --> 28:20.820
Listen, we've talked about this, Crevon.

28:20.820 --> 28:22.660
You gotta have more confidence in yourself.

28:23.220 --> 28:26.820
This is what the moment you've been training for in all those montages.

28:26.820 --> 28:28.500
This has all been building up to this.

28:28.500 --> 28:34.180
Okay, well, I guess it's who's hot right now in social media, would you say?

28:35.220 --> 28:36.100
That's right.

28:36.100 --> 28:37.540
Justin Guarini.

28:37.540 --> 28:40.740
So we're going to take this dude and we're going to wrap these rubber bands across his

28:40.740 --> 28:43.620
arms and make it look all lumpy like the Michelin Man.

28:43.620 --> 28:45.220
And the teens are going to love this.

28:45.780 --> 28:47.460
And we call it the rubber band challenge.

28:48.100 --> 28:49.380
The rubber band challenge.

28:49.380 --> 28:51.620
How many rubber bands can you get around your-

28:51.620 --> 28:52.420
Justin Guarini.

28:52.420 --> 28:52.740
Head.

28:53.540 --> 28:56.820
How many rubber bands can you get around your head before it splits like that one

28:56.820 --> 28:58.420
watermelon stunt that kids love?

28:58.420 --> 28:59.780
Oh, I don't know about all that, Justin.

29:00.660 --> 29:05.460
Here at Travis McElroy's rubber bands and stuff, I just rebanded it.

29:06.260 --> 29:06.980
That sounds-

29:06.980 --> 29:07.780
You rebanded it?

29:07.780 --> 29:08.740
Rebanded it.

29:08.740 --> 29:09.940
Sounds a little dangerous.

29:11.140 --> 29:16.580
How many watermelons can you get around your head before you have to go buy a rubber band?

29:16.580 --> 29:17.540
I love it.

29:17.540 --> 29:18.660
Put that on the package.

29:19.860 --> 29:22.580
Travis, in the words of my niece, you're canceled.

29:22.580 --> 29:23.220
Oh, man.

29:24.340 --> 29:26.500
Next up to run the company is Crevin.

29:26.500 --> 29:28.580
We love this Justin Guarini idea.

29:28.580 --> 29:29.060
Cool.

29:29.060 --> 29:30.180
Want to know my next one?

29:31.780 --> 29:33.300
I can't believe you have another one.

29:33.300 --> 29:34.580
That didn't take you all weekend?

29:34.580 --> 29:40.100
Uh, no, man, I did a big speedball and it just sort of came to me in like a minute and a half, so.

29:40.740 --> 29:41.780
Okay, what's your other one?

29:42.660 --> 29:43.460
More real guns.

29:44.580 --> 29:45.940
Well, you're canceled.

29:45.940 --> 29:47.220
Ah, shoot.

29:47.220 --> 29:49.060
You're canceled too, Crevin.

29:49.060 --> 29:51.940
Did you guys ever see that movie Wanted where they curve the bullets?

29:52.500 --> 29:54.020
Yeah, I love that play.

29:54.020 --> 29:54.820
Can we make those?

29:54.820 --> 29:55.780
Because that was badass.

29:56.580 --> 29:58.580
Okay, you're back to being CEO.

29:59.220 --> 29:59.860
Fuck yeah.

30:00.420 --> 30:03.380
Angelina Jolie curved it all around town.

30:03.380 --> 30:03.700
Are you-

30:03.700 --> 30:04.500
Can we get her?

30:04.500 --> 30:06.100
Can we get Angelina?

30:06.100 --> 30:07.380
Can we go to the money zone?

30:18.420 --> 30:24.900
I want to talk about MeUndies because MeUndies has a new design that I love so very much.

30:24.900 --> 30:32.260
It is pineapple and you can get pineapple underpants and pineapple socks and wear them

30:32.260 --> 30:36.020
at the same time and feel so cool.

30:36.740 --> 30:40.740
And they have multiple style options that you're going to find one that you love.

30:40.740 --> 30:44.180
They're, you know, they're that coveted micro modal fabric.

30:44.180 --> 30:46.100
It's three times softer than cotton.

30:46.100 --> 30:48.500
Why don't you already have these on your body?

30:48.500 --> 30:49.700
You'll love them.

30:49.700 --> 30:52.020
They have the softest lounge around the planet.

30:52.020 --> 30:54.820
I've got a couple different sets of their sleep pants at this point.

30:54.820 --> 30:56.580
I love them so much.

30:56.580 --> 30:59.300
They even have super comfy onesies at this point.

30:59.300 --> 31:01.460
Yes, that's right, onesies.

31:01.460 --> 31:07.140
You can get 50% off your first pair, free shipping, and 100% satisfaction guarantee

31:07.140 --> 31:10.340
if you go to MeUndies.com slash my brother.

31:10.340 --> 31:13.860
That's MeUndies.com slash my brother.

31:13.860 --> 31:18.500
It specifically says here to say something about the boxer briefs with a fly and you

31:18.500 --> 31:19.940
failed at doing that.

31:19.940 --> 31:25.380
So now I have to step in and say like you slip your bing bong through it and you pee

31:25.380 --> 31:27.140
right through these things.

31:27.140 --> 31:28.820
Okay, now we can move on.

31:28.820 --> 31:30.980
I want to talk about a sponsor too.

31:30.980 --> 31:34.980
It's Bowl and Branch, who I feel like we haven't spoken on in a while.

31:34.980 --> 31:39.540
I'm so glad we get to because every night I love sleeping on my Bowl and Branch sheets

31:39.540 --> 31:41.460
and that's not a bunch of fucking horseshit.

31:42.660 --> 31:44.020
I love these motherfuckers.

31:44.020 --> 31:46.020
Do they have a hole that I can pee through as well?

31:48.260 --> 31:53.220
Everyone has a custom made for your specific genitalia.

31:53.220 --> 31:58.500
Everything Bowl and Branch makes is designed with your comfort in mind from their pure

31:58.500 --> 32:02.580
1000% organic cotton signature soft sheets.

32:02.580 --> 32:09.140
Sheets which start out luxuriously soft and get even softer over time to their cozy throws

32:09.140 --> 32:10.500
to their plush.

32:10.500 --> 32:14.020
Until it disintegrates into little puffs of cotton seeds.

32:14.020 --> 32:14.500
Goodbye.

32:15.060 --> 32:20.340
It's supposed to be 100% cotton and Justin said 1000% and I'm having a very real inside

32:20.340 --> 32:23.140
discussion in my head about whether we're going to get sued over that or not.

32:23.140 --> 32:26.020
Well are we going to get in trouble because I think Justin just suggested that each one

32:26.020 --> 32:29.220
is 10 of them.

32:29.220 --> 32:34.420

Is that a bad name because there's already a thing called a bowl that everybody knows

32:50.180 --> 32:50.580
about?

32:50.580 --> 32:51.220
Sure.

32:51.220 --> 32:54.340
But you have to support them because they need you now.

32:54.340 --> 32:56.020
They need your money to buy a better name.

32:56.660 --> 33:00.980
It's too late to change it back so they're stuck with this and you've got to help them

33:00.980 --> 33:01.620

Hi, I'm Biz.

33:12.340 --> 33:13.300
And I'm Teresa.

33:13.300 --> 33:16.980

33:22.180 --> 33:25.060
honestly share what it's like to be a parent.

33:25.060 --> 33:27.380
And then that's how my day starts.

33:27.380 --> 33:27.700
Yeah.

33:27.700 --> 33:28.820
Come on.

33:28.820 --> 33:30.420
I'm so sick of it.

33:30.420 --> 33:32.340
When is that going to be over?

33:32.340 --> 33:34.500
Like, I want it to stop.

33:34.500 --> 33:36.100
Teresa, you're hurting my ears.

33:37.940 --> 33:39.140
I mean, that's it.

33:39.140 --> 33:39.540
Yeah.

33:39.540 --> 33:39.860
No.

33:39.860 --> 33:41.060
I just hate it.

33:41.060 --> 33:42.340
Yeah, I don't blame you.

33:42.340 --> 33:44.020
It sucks.

33:44.020 --> 33:45.140
It really sucks.

33:45.700 --> 33:50.660
So join us each week as we judge less, laugh more, and remind you that you are doing a

33:50.660 --> 33:51.780
great job.

33:51.780 --> 33:56.820
Find us on Maximumfun.org, on Apple Podcasts, or wherever you get your podcasts.

33:59.460 --> 33:59.700
Wow.

34:01.700 --> 34:02.420
I'm going bassy.

34:05.140 --> 34:06.020
Oh, God, that sounds bad.

34:06.020 --> 34:07.140
I want a munch.

34:07.140 --> 34:07.640
Squad.

34:07.640 --> 34:08.140
Squad.

34:08.140 --> 34:11.380
Yeah, digga digga, yeah, yeah, yeah.

34:11.380 --> 34:14.180
I want to munch.

34:14.180 --> 34:14.680
Squad.

34:15.940 --> 34:17.380
Trying to make this one sexier.

34:17.380 --> 34:23.300
This is a segment about brand eating, I guess is one way of putting it.

34:23.300 --> 34:29.540
It's just, it's a segment about the latest and greatest in fast food innovations.

34:29.540 --> 34:34.980
And it's also a segment about how the fast food industry in this country, through press

34:34.980 --> 34:44.820
releases, is taking the English language and our culture and dismantling it piecemeal for

34:44.820 --> 34:45.540
scrap.

34:45.540 --> 34:47.220
There's not even that much left.

34:47.220 --> 34:48.420
They're picking the bones, please.

34:48.420 --> 34:52.100
There's not even that much, thank you, there's not even that much left.

34:52.740 --> 34:54.260
And they are dismantling it.

34:54.260 --> 35:02.500
I have, this one's kind of a contest, and I want to see who is sort of like playing

35:02.500 --> 35:10.260
with fire the most, and who's sort of like most detrimental to language and culture.

35:10.260 --> 35:10.760
Okay.

35:11.620 --> 35:12.120
Okay.

35:12.120 --> 35:19.560
Okay, so the one I will tell you about is Just Egg Partners with Next Level Burger to

35:19.560 --> 35:21.800
create the Brekkie Burger.

35:23.000 --> 35:23.720
And that is...

35:26.120 --> 35:28.920
I need you to, there's so many words even in that.

35:28.920 --> 35:30.680
There's a company called Just Egg.

35:31.240 --> 35:32.360
Just Egg.

35:32.920 --> 35:33.800
What do they do?

35:33.800 --> 35:37.800
That's a wild ass name for a company, because one, it's not plural.

35:38.680 --> 35:39.640
Just Egg.

35:39.640 --> 35:40.680
Just the one egg.

35:40.680 --> 35:41.800
Just Egg.

35:41.800 --> 35:44.920
Hey, everybody, this is my new company, Just the One, oh, someone bought it.

35:44.920 --> 35:51.240
Just is the company, and the Just Egg is not eggs.

35:51.240 --> 35:58.920
Twist on you, it's made from 4,400, okay, this is what it says, Just Egg is made from

35:58.920 --> 36:05.560
the 4,400 year old mung bean, amazing to think those are still fresh enough for human consumption,

36:05.560 --> 36:06.600
but here we are.

36:06.600 --> 36:11.560
And the baked patty version used by Next Level Burger has more protein than conventional

36:11.560 --> 36:12.360
chicken eggs.

36:13.160 --> 36:22.360
So this is like a fake eggs with vegan sausage and vegan bacon on a burger.

36:22.360 --> 36:26.280
The thing is called the Brekkie Burger, and I find that highly upsetting.

36:26.280 --> 36:27.080
It's not great.

36:27.080 --> 36:28.360
Obviously, it's third place.

36:28.360 --> 36:28.860
Okay.

36:29.640 --> 36:34.280
I'm more upset by the fact that they make vegan eggs and they call it Just Egg, and

36:34.280 --> 36:41.080
that seems like, it's like, it's just egg, it's not this, it's just egg, Tony, eat it.

36:41.080 --> 36:43.560
Go ahead, just try it, Tony.

36:43.560 --> 36:48.040
The Pizza Hut Cheesy Bite Pizza has returned for a limited time.

36:48.040 --> 36:55.000
It's just in time for summer, and here's the quote, only Pizza Hut can bring you a bold

36:55.000 --> 37:01.800
creation, an epic pizza eating experience like Cheesy Bites Pizza, says Mary Ann Radley,

37:01.800 --> 37:05.640
chief brand officer of Pizza Hut, presumably because the technology is trademarked.

37:05.640 --> 37:13.480
But anyway, pizza meets party with this all time fan favorite, which lets you and your

37:13.480 --> 37:20.040
friends soak up some much needed vitamin cheese all summer long.

37:20.040 --> 37:26.520
Oh my God, I am so far away from my computer monitor when I record my Bim Bam, and I got

37:26.520 --> 37:29.800
a lot of spit on it from that vitamin cheese.

37:29.800 --> 37:37.480
It's vitamin cheese, which seems like the kind of thing to me that starts out as a joke,

37:37.480 --> 37:40.320
and then in 20 years people are like, well, it's gotta be good for you, it's got a lot

37:40.320 --> 37:42.760
of vitamin cheese.

37:42.760 --> 37:43.800
It's not bad.

37:43.800 --> 37:48.360
So Pizza Hut shits on the floor on June 17th.

37:48.360 --> 37:55.940
Today, no, sorry, yesterday, June 18th as we're recording this, Krispy Kreme announced

37:55.940 --> 38:02.720
their stuffed doughnuts, which will be free on June 22nd, which I'm assuming has passed.

38:02.720 --> 38:09.480
Yes, it has passed, so I'm sorry, but the product is still available, presumably.

38:09.480 --> 38:15.640
Okay, it's round, it's glazed, and for the first time in the US, it's filled.

38:15.640 --> 38:22.320
Introducing a doughnut innovation fans have only imagined until now, Krispy Kreme's new

38:22.320 --> 38:24.600
original filled doughnut.

38:24.600 --> 38:32.480
Wait, yeah, but Justin, this one's a ring, okay?

38:32.480 --> 38:35.000
This one's a ring, and it's filled all the way through.

38:35.000 --> 38:36.000
Do you understand?

38:36.000 --> 38:37.000
Okay.

38:37.000 --> 38:38.000
What they've done?

38:38.000 --> 38:39.000
No, I'm back, I'm back, I'm back.

38:39.000 --> 38:40.000
You're back.

38:40.000 --> 38:41.000
You can visualize it.

38:41.000 --> 38:46.840
Delivering a new taste experience for the doughnut verse, fuck off, Krispy Kreme's original,

38:46.840 --> 38:50.760
that's my least favorite cinematic universe that will be the most financially successful

38:50.760 --> 38:52.880
is the doughnut verse.

38:52.880 --> 38:57.440
Krispy Kreme's original filled is a whole new interpretation of the brand's iconic original

38:57.440 --> 39:01.260
glazed doughnut featuring Krispy Kreme's classic original glazed doughnut.

39:01.260 --> 39:05.320
This new product is initially offered with a choice of two fillings, classic cream and

39:05.320 --> 39:08.320
chocolate cream, providing the perfect bite every time.

39:08.320 --> 39:10.120
Okay, are you ready?

39:10.120 --> 39:11.120
Yeah.

39:11.120 --> 39:17.960
This is a quote from Dave Skeena, Chief Marketing Officer for Krispy Kreme Doughnut Corporation.

39:17.960 --> 39:21.680
Krispy Kreme was at the launch of Apollo 11.

39:21.680 --> 39:28.160
Giving fresh doughnuts to Americans witnessing liftoff of this monumental mission.

39:28.160 --> 39:33.280
As America prepares to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the moon landing, we want to

39:33.280 --> 39:37.160
give our fans a new taste experience that is out of this world.

39:37.160 --> 39:43.240
We choose to fill our original glazed doughnuts, not because it is easy, but because it is

39:43.240 --> 39:45.240
hard.

39:45.240 --> 39:49.280
No disrespect intended, JFK.

39:49.280 --> 39:52.140
Basically, it's not hard.

39:52.140 --> 39:55.800
It's melt in your mouth, delicious.

39:55.800 --> 39:56.800
How could they?

39:56.800 --> 40:01.400
This is the why, why are they doing this for this?

40:01.400 --> 40:04.680
Why do they care about the Apollo 11 mission?

40:04.680 --> 40:07.400
They were there.

40:07.400 --> 40:12.440
They were there and now they did a doughnut that's as good as the moon landing.

40:12.440 --> 40:18.320
It's the 70th anniversary of the beginning of the Manhattan Project and we were there

40:18.320 --> 40:23.000
making sure those scientists had lots of doughnut fuel to blow up the whole earth with.

40:23.000 --> 40:27.160
And it's to celebrate, we're going to blow up your mouth with our creamed fuck stuffed

40:27.160 --> 40:28.460
doughnut boys.

40:28.460 --> 40:34.440
Get in here and just start biting everything you see and just wait for nuclear winter courtesy

40:34.440 --> 40:37.200
of your pals at Krispy Kreme.

40:37.200 --> 40:40.640
I mean, it's just, it's unfathomable.

40:40.640 --> 40:45.520
You also can't be like, we didn't do it, not because it's easy, but because it is hard.

40:45.520 --> 40:46.520
It's not hard.

40:46.520 --> 40:49.080
Actually, I messed up.

40:49.080 --> 40:50.080
It's not hard.

40:50.080 --> 40:53.800
I just thought it would be so fucking funny if I quoted that beloved dead president that

40:53.800 --> 40:56.280
got shot in Dallas, remember?

40:56.280 --> 40:57.320
We were there too.

40:57.320 --> 40:59.320
We just don't like to brag about that one.

40:59.320 --> 41:03.480
But we were there selling Krispy hot fresh, delicious Krispy Kreme doughnuts that day

41:03.480 --> 41:04.480
too.

41:04.480 --> 41:07.540
Everyone remembers JFK getting shot, but what do they not remember?

41:07.540 --> 41:12.160
Your pal Krusty Kreme in the audience passing out all these delicious doughnuts.

41:12.160 --> 41:16.480
God, marketing, advertising doughnuts well spent, huh Krusty Kreme?

41:16.480 --> 41:21.400
If you slow the Zapruder film down and you look at the crowd, they're clearly enjoying

41:21.400 --> 41:25.240
a lot of delicious Krispy Kreme doughnuts.

41:25.240 --> 41:26.240
That's all I'm saying.

41:26.240 --> 41:27.240
Nobody wants to talk about that.

41:27.240 --> 41:31.960
They just want to talk about the grassy knoll and the death of our beloved president.

41:31.960 --> 41:34.520
It's the second, yes, I agree.

41:34.520 --> 41:37.320
That is definitely the most important thing that happened there.

41:37.320 --> 41:43.760
The second most important thing is we were there with doughnuts at that time.

41:43.760 --> 41:48.120
Anyway, these ones are filled with cream now, so we got that going for us which is huge.

41:48.120 --> 41:51.520
Thank God I can finally get a doughnut with cream in it.

41:51.520 --> 41:52.520
But not where you'd expect.

41:52.520 --> 41:58.080
And even less doughnut to eat because they done cut out the middle of it.

41:58.080 --> 42:00.800
Yeah, it's basically a cream hoop with crust.

42:00.800 --> 42:06.760
Let me give you less doughnut for the money and you'll thank me for it.

42:06.760 --> 42:07.760
This shit is thick.

42:07.760 --> 42:09.760
Oh, is this a dummy thick doughnut?

42:09.760 --> 42:12.320
It's a real thick one.

42:12.320 --> 42:14.320
Okay, good.

42:14.320 --> 42:15.320
Do you want a Yahoo though?

42:15.320 --> 42:16.320
Absolutely.

42:16.320 --> 42:18.080
This one's sent in by Brandon.

42:18.080 --> 42:19.080
Thanks Brandon.

42:19.080 --> 42:20.080
It's Yahoo Answers user.

42:20.080 --> 42:21.880
Thanks Brandon.

42:21.880 --> 42:23.440
We don't usually do that, Travis.

42:23.440 --> 42:27.920
I know, but I felt like I wasn't voicing my gratitude enough just in general, but also

42:27.920 --> 42:29.360
specifically for Brandon.

42:29.360 --> 42:31.000
So thanks, Brandon.

42:31.000 --> 42:34.160
This is from Yahoo Answers user, Penfold, who asks.

42:34.160 --> 42:36.520
Thanks Penfold.

42:36.520 --> 42:40.080
What to do for a pig-themed jazz party?

42:40.080 --> 42:43.520
Huh?

42:43.520 --> 42:46.360
My friend's kid is having a party with a pig theme.

42:46.360 --> 42:47.840
I think she likes them.

42:47.840 --> 42:52.120
They're her fave animal or something, but also it's at a park with jazz music?

42:52.120 --> 42:53.120
What should I-

42:53.120 --> 42:54.120
Stiles Davis.

42:54.120 --> 42:55.120
What?

42:55.120 --> 42:56.120
What?

42:56.120 --> 43:00.140
Like a pigsty, but it's Stiles Davis.

43:00.140 --> 43:01.200
What should I expect?

43:01.200 --> 43:02.440
What gift will fit the theme?

43:02.440 --> 43:03.840
Help, I really want to impress her.

43:03.840 --> 43:04.840
She's really sweet.

43:04.840 --> 43:08.240
Update, the kid is 10 years old and it's definitely not Peppa Pig themed.

43:08.240 --> 43:09.480
I know she hates that.

43:09.480 --> 43:13.480
Boy, that's a cool brain that this child has.

43:13.480 --> 43:17.120
I love pigs, but not the famous one that the children enjoy.

43:17.120 --> 43:18.120
Not that bastardization.

43:18.120 --> 43:20.800
That's not how pigs really act.

43:20.800 --> 43:21.800
Pigs don't live in houses.

43:21.800 --> 43:22.800
Like classic pigs.

43:22.800 --> 43:23.800
Yeah.

43:23.800 --> 43:26.320
Roll around some slop, you fucking narc.

43:26.320 --> 43:27.320
I like frogs.

43:27.320 --> 43:29.120
No, not fucking Kermit.

43:29.120 --> 43:33.800
He does not live in a pond, except in that one movie when he does.

43:33.800 --> 43:34.800
Update two, I'm freaking out.

43:34.800 --> 43:37.360
I think my friend's kid wants me to do karaoke too?

43:37.360 --> 43:40.160
Are there any jazz songs about pigs?

43:40.160 --> 43:42.640
Blue styes.

43:42.640 --> 43:46.400
You just did stye twice.

43:46.400 --> 43:47.400
You just did stye.

43:47.400 --> 43:51.200
I don't know of any jazz songs that contain something that rhymes with oink.

43:51.200 --> 43:53.400
I don't know what to tell you.

43:53.400 --> 43:55.640
List all the jazz songs you know right now.

43:55.640 --> 43:56.640
Blue skies.

43:56.640 --> 43:57.640
Let's see.

43:57.640 --> 44:00.540
End of list.

44:00.540 --> 44:04.300
In a Sentimental Mood by Duke Ellington, of course.

44:04.300 --> 44:08.240
You just Googled jazz songs and that's the first result on Google?

44:08.240 --> 44:09.840
You're reading them in order.

44:09.840 --> 44:10.840
How could you?

44:10.840 --> 44:11.840
Wait.

44:11.840 --> 44:13.020
Goodbye Pork Pie Hat by Charles Mingus?

44:13.020 --> 44:14.720
Is that close enough?

44:14.720 --> 44:19.040
That one writes itself.

44:19.040 --> 44:24.480
But that's really more about Charles just throwing his hat away and being very sad about

44:24.480 --> 44:25.480
it.

44:25.480 --> 44:26.780
It's not so much about the pork.

44:26.780 --> 44:27.840
Pig land.

44:27.840 --> 44:30.200
It's like bird land.

44:30.200 --> 44:32.880
So what should I do for my pig themed jazz party?

44:32.880 --> 44:36.580
The kid likes pigs, but the park is jazz, I guess.

44:36.580 --> 44:37.580
Let me tell you this.

44:37.580 --> 44:40.940
First, right off the bat, don't bring any kind of pork food.

44:40.940 --> 44:42.400
That's a misstep.

44:42.400 --> 44:46.460
Because you're going to think, oh this is fun because it's like pig, but if the kid

44:46.460 --> 44:53.960
likes pigs, my bet is that that does not extend to consuming them in a fun way.

44:53.960 --> 45:01.100
Henry's very into superheroes right now, but if I brought him a nice flank cut of Iron

45:01.100 --> 45:05.360
Man meat, he would be pretty PO'd, I bet.

45:05.360 --> 45:06.360
Yes.

45:06.360 --> 45:11.620
Bebe is really into like petting zoos and aquariums, and I fear the day when she puts

45:11.620 --> 45:14.080
two and two together.

45:14.080 --> 45:18.640
Get the giant keyboard from Big.

45:18.640 --> 45:21.320
Get a pig.

45:21.320 --> 45:26.520
Sprinkle corn on the piano.

45:26.520 --> 45:30.840
And then that pig is going to play jazz.

45:30.840 --> 45:36.680
I mean, it will be a very avant garde form of jazz, but it is going to be jazz, and it's

45:36.680 --> 45:39.720
going to be hard to deny it as jazz.

45:39.720 --> 45:41.960
Now get a stand up bass.

45:41.960 --> 45:44.040
Put some corn on it.

45:44.040 --> 45:48.280
That pig's going to play some jazz on a stand up bass.

45:48.280 --> 45:49.280
Yours is dumb.

45:49.280 --> 45:50.280
A trumpet.

45:50.280 --> 45:52.920
Travis, that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.

45:52.920 --> 45:57.840
It's got to be creamed corn that you sort of slop down the fretboard, or else it's not

45:57.840 --> 46:00.240
going to stick.

46:00.240 --> 46:02.240
Speak before you speak.

46:02.240 --> 46:08.360
If you don't have any corn, you can use dead cowboys, because that's what they do in Deadwood.

46:08.360 --> 46:12.720
That's the only thing I know that pigs really love eating, is dead cowboys.

46:12.720 --> 46:14.160
What would you get?

46:14.160 --> 46:15.160
Maybe some peppa pig?

46:15.160 --> 46:16.160
No, fuck.

46:16.160 --> 46:17.160
No.

46:17.160 --> 46:18.160
Shit.

46:18.160 --> 46:19.160
Hates that one.

46:19.160 --> 46:20.360
Maybe a pet pig.

46:20.360 --> 46:24.160
Maybe just a big ol' pig that they are now in charge of.

46:24.160 --> 46:26.360
That does autographs and photo ops.

46:26.360 --> 46:32.960
Oh, get him a pet pig, but name the pig, you know, Herbie Hancock or something sweet like

46:32.960 --> 46:33.960
that.

46:33.960 --> 46:34.960
Or Stiles Davis.

46:34.960 --> 46:38.160
That one's still bad.

46:38.160 --> 46:39.160
Let's do another question.

46:39.160 --> 46:42.960
Did you guys know Shaq just started buying up Papa John's's?

46:42.960 --> 46:43.960
Huh?

46:43.960 --> 46:44.960
This is unrelated.

46:44.960 --> 46:53.480
It's not only much government, did you guys know that Shaq just started?

46:53.480 --> 46:56.840
Papa John's is like, we are in this huge chamber.

46:56.840 --> 46:59.160
We cannot get out because of the bad John's.

46:59.160 --> 47:00.160
Everyone hated.

47:00.160 --> 47:04.600
And they went to Shaq and they said, Shaq, if you say nice things about Papa John's,

47:04.600 --> 47:08.880
we'll give you $4 million and 87,000 shares of stock.

47:08.880 --> 47:11.280
And also some Papa John's's.

47:11.280 --> 47:14.760
So he just started buying up Papa John's's.

47:14.760 --> 47:15.760
And he just started-

47:15.760 --> 47:21.640
Justin DeFleur's girl is actually Papa's John.

47:21.640 --> 47:23.880
He just started acquiring them.

47:23.880 --> 47:26.640
Like wild, he just started buying up Papa John's's.

47:26.640 --> 47:33.640
There's a Papa John's in Atlanta where the number to get it is 470-444-Shaq, nice.

47:33.640 --> 47:34.640
Call that number right now.

47:34.640 --> 47:35.640
That's going to give you a Papa John's.

47:35.640 --> 47:37.800
They are probably getting a few calls.

47:37.800 --> 47:41.480
So please only call if you're in the area.

47:41.480 --> 47:45.560
But this is like, he bought seven of them.

47:45.560 --> 47:48.480
And it's like, these are the good ones.

47:48.480 --> 47:53.080
These are the ones that are okay because Shaq owns them.

47:53.080 --> 47:54.920
These are Shaq's Papa's John's.

47:54.920 --> 47:57.600
I would much rather eat at a Papa Shaq's.

47:57.600 --> 48:01.760
Papa Shaq's Slam Dunk City, I would be there in a fucking heartbeat.

48:01.760 --> 48:09.020
If they renamed the restaurant to Papa Shaq's, I would frequent it again, probably.

48:09.020 --> 48:13.120
There is a Papa John's on Houger Boulevard here in Huntington.

48:13.120 --> 48:16.800
And you know how they have like the sign out front with like where they put the specials

48:16.800 --> 48:19.000
and the deals.

48:19.000 --> 48:24.000
The one in Huntington has had the same message for the past eight months and in huge letters

48:24.000 --> 48:27.440
it just says, locally owned.

48:27.440 --> 48:30.400
We will not bend the knee to Lord Shaq.

48:30.400 --> 48:34.720
Well, I think it's part of reference to Papa Shaq.

48:34.720 --> 48:35.720
To shitty John.

48:35.720 --> 48:38.720
Not to Shaq, their new savior.

48:38.720 --> 48:44.480
I thought he was saying, this is the house of John.

48:44.480 --> 48:46.920
We are unbent and unbroken.

48:46.920 --> 48:50.600
Do not even approach us with your golden coins, Shaq.

48:50.600 --> 48:57.080
We know you have many of them from the movie, Kazam or Shazam, whichever it was.

48:57.080 --> 48:59.680
Shaq owns an Atlanta Krispy Kreme.

48:59.680 --> 49:05.920
In Las Vegas, he owns a fast casual restaurant called Big Chicken, a fine dining place in

49:05.920 --> 49:10.600
LA, and he once ran 27 Five Guys franchises.

49:10.600 --> 49:13.800
Wow, that's 135 guys.

49:13.800 --> 49:16.640
Dammit Travis, you did the math so much faster than I did.

49:16.640 --> 49:19.720
Yep, I was a mathlete.

49:19.720 --> 49:23.840
Just real quick, the perfect name for Jazz Pig is Fats Waller.

49:23.840 --> 49:25.840
Yeah, pretty good, pretty good.

49:25.840 --> 49:26.840
Thank you.

49:26.840 --> 49:34.320
The press release says, broadly it could ignite outside interest to garner additional franchisees

49:34.320 --> 49:35.880
into the system.

49:35.880 --> 49:40.480
What, how, okay, how are you making life choices where you're like, I know what I'm gonna do

49:40.480 --> 49:43.560
for a living, open the restaurant that Shaq has some of.

49:43.560 --> 49:49.440
No, no, I've heard a lot of bad press about Papa John's, wait, what's that?

49:49.440 --> 49:52.680
Shaq bought some, huh?

49:52.680 --> 49:54.680
Just rename it Papa Shaq's.

49:54.680 --> 50:05.120
Oh, okay, I'll take two, two Papa Shaq's please, with extra shakaroni.

50:05.120 --> 50:10.520
We've got all the food you want, we do have shakaroni.

50:10.520 --> 50:11.520
Shakaroni and cheese.

50:11.520 --> 50:15.320
We've got shakaroni and cheese, we've got shakaroni salad.

50:15.320 --> 50:22.760
It's an expansive, expansive side dish menu that Shaq himself insisted on, and also we

50:22.760 --> 50:25.000
do sell basketballs now, which is wild.

50:25.000 --> 50:29.760
Make sure you dip all that shit in our free throw stink water, which is what he has renamed

50:29.760 --> 50:31.760
the garlic dipping sauce, unfortunately.

50:31.760 --> 50:37.560
We begged him not to, but he sold out, he's a genius.

50:37.560 --> 50:41.840
Wow, this whole time we shouldn't have called it free throw stink water.

50:41.840 --> 50:48.400
I can't even know that's stink water.

50:48.400 --> 50:52.200
Just call it Papa Shaq's, please.

50:52.200 --> 50:56.600
I can't even do Papa John's shit in Munch Squad anymore, because there's like the preamble

50:56.600 --> 51:04.200
it would require when you use up all of our hilarious movie box office joke time.

51:04.200 --> 51:10.000
So if it was just called Papa Shaq's, one, all those would become 17% funnier fucking

51:10.000 --> 51:11.000
instantly.

51:11.000 --> 51:14.320
And we could all feel good about eating at Papa Shaq's.

51:14.320 --> 51:18.280
Yeah, buy up Jimmy John's while you're at it, and call it Shaqy Shaq's.

51:18.280 --> 51:19.280
Shaqy Shaq's.

51:19.280 --> 51:21.600
He's on the board, by the way.

51:21.600 --> 51:23.840
He's on the board of directors.

51:23.840 --> 51:25.320
Of Jemethy Johns?

51:25.320 --> 51:28.120
Yeah, of Papa John's.

51:28.120 --> 51:31.480
One of the people that sits at the big table to make the big decisions about whether or

51:31.480 --> 51:35.800
not to call it Papa Shaq's is Shaq himself, he will almost certainly be the tallest person

51:35.800 --> 51:37.680
in the room.

51:37.680 --> 51:41.520
Certainly he can take the saucy throne for himself.

51:41.520 --> 51:51.720
There is a vacuum of leadership, a vacuum of power that Shaq is prepared to leap into.

51:51.720 --> 51:56.000
The ones that he owns, there are size 22 footprints at the front door, so you can kind of see

51:56.000 --> 51:59.720
how you stack up to Shaq.

51:59.720 --> 52:06.400
When the pizza chain announced his board placement in March, chief executive Steve Ritchie said,

52:06.400 --> 52:09.520
organizational decision makers cheered.

52:09.520 --> 52:17.360
Well, certainly, what other response are you going to have to Shaq, Shaq has thrown in

52:17.360 --> 52:18.760
his lot with us.

52:18.760 --> 52:23.960
The powerful man is here to save our terrible pizza.

52:23.960 --> 52:28.560
Wicked John is gone and Shaq is here to deliver us.

52:28.560 --> 52:33.400
He demands fealty is the one thing about it, is that he demands your fealty.

52:33.400 --> 52:41.440
Please Shaq, act as our shield, our Shaq shield O'Neal.

52:41.440 --> 52:46.760
Part of the agreement is that Shaq will be made available for 60 minutes of total interview

52:46.760 --> 52:52.520
time promoting Papa John's, he will be trained ahead of time for each talk.

52:52.520 --> 52:58.880
Wait, so there's one hour of Shaq spread across all of time that they could use.

52:58.880 --> 53:04.000
Shaq just got a little chest clock, a little speed chest clock, he's like, okay, go.

53:04.000 --> 53:07.920
Shaq, I'd like to start off talking to you about your career.

53:07.920 --> 53:11.000
Fuck no, we've only got 60 minutes, talk about pizza.

53:11.000 --> 53:13.960
What is it about pizza that drew you to Papa John's?

53:13.960 --> 53:17.960
Pizza's awesome, I've said that in interviews before, you've just wasted 14 seconds of my

53:17.960 --> 53:18.960
precious interview time.

53:18.960 --> 53:19.960
Next question.

53:19.960 --> 53:25.120
It's wild guys, for the affiliation announcement between Shaq and Papa John's, Shaq will provide

53:25.120 --> 53:31.000
business and consumer PR interviews, including two broadcast TV and three print or online

53:31.000 --> 53:33.160
media interviews in New York City.

53:33.160 --> 53:37.600
Two approved photos for release, one at a Papa John's restaurant and one making pizza

53:37.600 --> 53:38.600
with Richie.

53:38.600 --> 53:43.800
A social media post, a social media post, a quote for a press release, a business headshot

53:43.800 --> 53:48.080
and business bio, that's what Shaq is providing.

53:48.080 --> 53:52.760
Shaq's to be included in that Papa John's heat.

53:52.760 --> 53:58.880
Just to get a little bit of Shaq's light to shine on this terrible pizza person.

53:58.880 --> 53:59.880
Who's Richie?

53:59.880 --> 54:04.920
Like the guy who runs, Steve Richie's, chief executive, Papa John's.

54:04.920 --> 54:08.600
And he had to put in a contract, I want to make pizza with Shaq.

54:08.600 --> 54:10.120
I bet that that was the, that was-

54:10.120 --> 54:11.880
It did add in the contract.

54:11.880 --> 54:17.880
Yes, we can assume safely, Steve Richie, chief executive of Papa John's, put into a written

54:17.880 --> 54:22.240
document that part of the deal is you have to make pizza with me, Shaq.

54:22.240 --> 54:23.240
And that's how I met Shaq.

54:23.240 --> 54:26.160
They have to take one picture of it.

54:26.160 --> 54:27.160
You promised.

54:27.160 --> 54:28.160
You have to be my best friend now.

54:28.160 --> 54:31.160
You promised to come make pizza with me, Shaq.

54:31.160 --> 54:32.160
You promised.

54:32.160 --> 54:37.920
Yeah, but you can have one of my tickets for the big concert, Shaq, but you got to come

54:37.920 --> 54:40.680
over to my house and be my friend for the day.

54:40.680 --> 54:46.080
All right, so Shaq owns Seven Papa John's.

54:46.080 --> 54:49.440
Folks, that's going to do it for us here on my brother, my brother and me.

54:49.440 --> 54:52.320
We hope you've enjoyed yourself.

54:52.320 --> 54:54.520
Please only eat at Shaq's Papa John's.

54:54.520 --> 54:55.520
Don't get it twisted.

54:55.520 --> 55:01.480
The brand is still treacherous, but the ones that Shaq owns are probably okay, I guess.

55:01.480 --> 55:03.480
I don't actually know how that all works.

55:03.480 --> 55:05.600
I'm not a scientist.

55:05.600 --> 55:09.000
You bet I'll stick with Domino's, the shadowy cabal that runs that place.

55:09.000 --> 55:12.760
It's not been uncovered for its evil yet, so go for it.

55:12.760 --> 55:15.080
Let's see.

55:15.080 --> 55:16.080
What do we need to-

55:16.080 --> 55:17.080
I got a couple things I want to tell people.

55:17.080 --> 55:18.080
Housekeeping, Travis.

55:18.080 --> 55:19.080
Yes, please.

55:19.080 --> 55:20.080
Can I?

55:20.080 --> 55:21.080
First off-

55:21.080 --> 55:22.080
Please, go ahead.

55:22.080 --> 55:23.080
We got our book two are coming up.

55:23.080 --> 55:27.360
It's for the Adventure Zone graphic novel book two, Murder on the Rockport Limited.

55:27.360 --> 55:36.080
We're going to be in on July 16th, Justin and Griffin will be in New York City and dad

55:36.080 --> 55:40.100
and I will be in Portland, but I'm pretty sure the Portland show is already sold out.

55:40.100 --> 55:45.480
And then on July 17th, Justin and Griffin will be in Austin, Texas, and dad and I will

55:45.480 --> 55:47.640
be in Los Angeles.

55:47.640 --> 55:52.220
Oh, and I should mention Carrie Peach, our amazing artist, is going to be at the New

55:52.220 --> 55:56.760
York show on the 16th with Justin and Griffin.

55:56.760 --> 56:03.220
And listen, that LA show isn't selling as much as we would like.

56:03.220 --> 56:08.140
Maybe because it's like a day before San Diego Comic Con, we don't know.

56:08.140 --> 56:11.600
But if you have friends in LA that like the show, tell them to get tickets.

56:11.600 --> 56:13.840
I think it's just they're all jocks, you know?

56:13.840 --> 56:18.480
And then they're all just such jocky, you know, cool kids in LA.

56:18.480 --> 56:25.040
And then on the 19th, we are doing a book tour show in San Diego during San Diego Comic

56:25.040 --> 56:26.140
Con at the Balboa.

56:26.140 --> 56:29.940
And then the day after that, on the 20th, we are going to do an Adventure Zone live

56:29.940 --> 56:32.040
show at San Diego Comic Con.

56:32.040 --> 56:36.800
And you can get tickets for all of that if you go to McElroy.family and click on tours,

56:36.800 --> 56:42.360
as well as other upcoming tour shows at the end of August, we're going to be in Atlanta

56:42.360 --> 56:43.360
and Orlando.

56:43.360 --> 56:45.360
Get your tickets for that.

56:45.360 --> 56:49.040
Also want to tell people, we have some new amazing merch up there.

56:49.040 --> 56:53.040
We're trying to add new merch up every month.

56:53.040 --> 56:55.640
So if you haven't checked in a while, go to McElroyMerch.com.

56:55.640 --> 57:03.360
Oh, and before I forget, speaking of the book, that comes out July, I believe 17th.

57:03.360 --> 57:09.000
So if you haven't pre-ordered a copy yet, go to TheAdventureZoneComic.com, pre-order

57:09.000 --> 57:14.440
that and go ahead and, I'm very proud of it and I just want you all to see it.

57:14.440 --> 57:17.640
So pre-order it and you'll like it a lot, I promise.

57:17.640 --> 57:19.460
I can't do any more of these.

57:19.460 --> 57:22.880
So thanks to John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song, It's a Departure

57:22.880 --> 57:24.840
off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

57:24.840 --> 57:26.240
I highly recommend you get it.

57:26.240 --> 57:31.960
The tunes are great and also the disc can't be burned or melted in any way.

57:31.960 --> 57:35.760
The disc is fully heat resistant and you can take that to the bank.

57:35.760 --> 57:37.920
Thanks also to Maximum Fun for having us on the network.

57:37.920 --> 57:41.520

57:41.520 --> 57:47.720
Network and Judge John Hodgman and Jordan Jesse Goh and a bunch more at MaximumFun.org

57:47.720 --> 57:51.480
and we have other stuff at McElroy.Family.

57:51.480 --> 57:52.480
Anything else?

57:52.480 --> 57:53.480
I think that's it.

57:53.480 --> 57:54.480
I think that'll do it.

57:54.480 --> 57:55.480
Okay, here's that final Yahoo.

57:55.480 --> 57:57.080
It was sent in by Adrian Cowles.

57:57.080 --> 57:58.840
Thanks Adrian, it's Yahoo Answers user.

57:58.840 --> 58:09.880
They're anonymous, so I'm going to call them Zippy asks, does it seem like ticklish feet

58:09.880 --> 58:13.720
are less common now than they were 40 years ago?

58:13.720 --> 58:14.720
Who?

58:14.720 --> 58:18.600
My name is Justin McElroy.

58:18.600 --> 58:20.080
I'm Travis McElroy.

58:20.080 --> 58:21.080
I'm Griffin McElroy.

58:21.080 --> 58:42.120

58:46.800 --> 58:51.200
Hey, if you like your podcast to be focused and well researched and your podcast host

58:51.200 --> 58:55.280
to be uncharismatic, unhorny strangers who have no interest in horses, then this is not

58:55.280 --> 58:56.280
the podcast for you.

58:56.280 --> 58:58.520
Yeah, and what's your deal?

58:58.520 --> 58:59.520
I'm Emily.

58:59.520 --> 59:00.520
I'm Lisa.

59:00.520 --> 59:03.940
Our show is called Baby Geniuses and its hosts are horny adult idiots.

59:03.940 --> 59:06.920
We discover weird Wikipedia pages every episode.

59:06.920 --> 59:09.180
We discuss institutional misogyny.

59:09.180 --> 59:12.980
We ask each other the dumbest questions and our listeners won't stop sending us pictures

59:12.980 --> 59:13.980
of their butts.

59:13.980 --> 59:16.760
We haven't asked them to stop, but they also aren't stopping.

59:16.760 --> 59:46.720
Join us on Baby Geniuses every other week on Maximumfun.org.
