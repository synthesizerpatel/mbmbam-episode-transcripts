WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

00:05.760 --> 00:10.580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

00:11.480 --> 00:17.660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

00:17.660 --> 00:30.660
What's up, you cool, baby?

00:48.100 --> 00:50.100
It's better it's better with you

00:53.980 --> 00:55.980
It's better it's better

01:00.260 --> 01:02.260
Better it's better

01:02.260 --> 01:09.540
It's better it's better with you

01:10.620 --> 01:16.780
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother my brother and me an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy

01:17.780 --> 01:24.180
Well me, I'm your miller's brother Travis McElroy. I'm your sweet baby brother Griffin McElroy

01:25.340 --> 01:29.980
Got some new tech. Can you tell I'm looking at your tech? It's so sick, dude

01:29.980 --> 01:35.740
It's buttery gone are the days where the microphone was a desk guy now

01:35.900 --> 01:40.860
He lives on this cyber robot arm that I can make I'll go all over. Yeah, you have a mic buddy

01:41.220 --> 01:43.220
I've never felt more like

01:43.340 --> 01:49.300
Daddy than I do right now. You mean our daddy not just like the state of being of like

01:49.660 --> 01:55.880
Not the way internet people say it like us like I don't know a sexy older person

01:56.620 --> 01:58.620
Santa Claus, I mean I'm

01:58.620 --> 02:01.020
We'll get we'll come back to that

02:01.020 --> 02:05.420
I mean it like our actual I mean it in the way that God intended it when he came up with the word daddy

02:05.420 --> 02:11.660
Yeah, when he was like, I'm your I'm your daddy. I shower you with gifts. Enjoy this these loaves of mana

02:12.620 --> 02:19.580
Enjoy this copy of secret of mana that I got at the local electronics boutique. He's enjoy this

02:20.140 --> 02:22.140
box set of Hana Montana

02:22.860 --> 02:26.460
yeah, when he rained down Hana Montana down on the

02:26.460 --> 02:32.140
Pilgrims been a while since I've read the old BI BLE but

02:35.060 --> 02:38.220
Brand new tech very stoked about it

02:39.220 --> 02:43.260
Yeah, you guys you guys are more sort of tech savvy than I am

02:43.260 --> 02:49.900
Well, that's not true, but at least for me but go on well in terms of recording gadgets and gizmos

02:49.900 --> 02:57.020
I think that you do take the take the K. Yeah, I've got a light up juice pop that light up for me, buddy. He's

02:58.540 --> 03:03.180
So much better I got a thing that's supposed to make the microphone louder and cleaner

03:03.180 --> 03:08.980
I'm not gonna say the name of it because I will disparage the brand and it could be a me problem and not a brand problem

03:09.700 --> 03:14.900
But I plug this this do hickey in and it introduced a loud hiss to the recording

03:14.900 --> 03:18.980
I said that's unacceptable. I reached over to fix it and when I touched the box

03:18.980 --> 03:20.180
Uh-huh

03:20.180 --> 03:25.240
It started to play radio station at first. I thought this was in my mind

03:25.660 --> 03:28.740
Yeah, I thought that it was like a pizza mom

03:29.460 --> 03:32.060
Brain plate that maybe I had a big sock

03:32.060 --> 03:37.740
There's a lot of references for this because I was gonna say like Lucio ball and her fillings when she talked about being able to get

03:37.740 --> 03:42.700
Like government CIA wiretaps through her teeth when I was a kid. I read a book

03:42.700 --> 03:49.340
It was like a young like a beginning reader chapter book about a cat who when he brushed his teeth

03:49.340 --> 03:52.940
He could read minds and get radio stations. Oh, yeah

03:53.620 --> 03:55.620
Whatever it there was also

03:56.700 --> 04:00.180
Track this book down before so if I could use my bully pulpit for a second

04:00.180 --> 04:05.220
If this ring junior bells for you, cuz I'd love to track this one down. It was in the same vein as like

04:05.740 --> 04:07.900
Can you teach me how to pick my nose or?

04:07.900 --> 04:12.500
Yeah, the bubblegum monster or the bubblegum monster a month or kid minus

04:13.700 --> 04:16.240
Kid might talk fucked up by the way

04:17.860 --> 04:22.380
But I was also gonna reference the are you afraid of the dark episode where the kids in the hearse and he listens to the

04:22.380 --> 04:24.380
radio station for dead people and

04:25.260 --> 04:30.460
This show is winding down. By the way, we got references for another ten years. Do not worry about it. Easy

04:30.460 --> 04:32.460
They made a lot of are you afraid of the dark?

04:32.460 --> 04:36.740
but there was a lot of there was a lot of are you afraid of the dark spaghetti at the wall of just like

04:36.740 --> 04:39.740
They say that he's in a giant pinball machines the same thing. How's this?

04:40.460 --> 04:43.300
sick, so like this could add a

04:44.140 --> 04:46.420
new cool, you know how on like

04:47.660 --> 04:49.660
daily show

04:49.940 --> 04:53.740
The British daily show on HBO like yeah

04:54.220 --> 04:59.100
You know how they do sometimes they'll just like pull the newspaper out and they'll be like, oh, you'll hear something

04:59.100 --> 05:00.940
And then they'll like do jokes about that

05:00.940 --> 05:05.300
That does always feel a little graspy to me by the way when they're like we forgot to write anything

05:05.300 --> 05:10.020
Let's just look at the headlines the newspaper and do jokes. It's it's yeah, I mean

05:10.580 --> 05:15.980
They are overpaid Hollywood elites. Thank you. I was thinking maybe this could be fun for us

05:15.980 --> 05:20.660
I can't control what the radio station is gonna be but I could just sort of pipe it in

05:20.660 --> 05:25.580
I think it comes out of my mouth when I touch the box and then like you guys can listen to make

05:28.860 --> 05:33.980
I've removed to the bar. I removed the by the boxes. Oh, see I thought we could play pretend for a moment

05:33.980 --> 05:36.420
Oh, yeah, sure. Sorry. Let me touch the box

05:38.300 --> 05:40.300
Today baseball news

05:40.780 --> 05:45.300
we got a big home runner coming at you from the state of

05:45.980 --> 05:49.960
New York City Derek Jeter's back and he's got a big

05:50.700 --> 05:54.380
Bump bump bump bump traffic is traffic time. It's

05:54.900 --> 06:00.740
1018 a.m. Eastern Time and the Brooklyn Bridge is very crowded. You're getting a lot of New York right here

06:00.740 --> 06:02.740
I

06:03.060 --> 06:05.060
Even more bigger breaking news

06:05.340 --> 06:12.060
Nintendo World Store at 30 rock have a big sale got to get down there. They have half off Mario's and

06:12.500 --> 06:14.860
Donkey Kong is bump bump bump bump

06:15.660 --> 06:19.900
This truck this this GD traffic guys the Brooklyn Bridge

06:20.940 --> 06:28.300
It's rare that you hear a triple breaking news interruption on the same program the peak problem this show is enough about the traffic

06:28.300 --> 06:32.700
I just want to hear more about Derek Jeter's triumphant return to base bump up bump. Yeah, it was great

06:33.100 --> 06:35.380
He every time he got up there he scored a point

06:36.500 --> 06:38.660
He got up sometimes when it wasn't his turn

06:39.780 --> 06:43.300
Is that if one of us is laughing while the other one is doing something?

06:43.460 --> 06:48.640
They are legally mandated to keep doing it. Even when there is no more meat on the bone

06:48.640 --> 06:52.500
They're just chomping on there wasn't meat on it to begin with

06:52.500 --> 07:00.060
If it's working for somebody but at the center of the bone is where the marrow is and restaurants charge like a

07:00.300 --> 07:02.420
Hundred bucks for that stuff. That's an excellent point

07:02.420 --> 07:07.260
If you chew on the bone long enough, even sans meat, you're gonna get to the good stuff

07:07.260 --> 07:14.280
Eventually, that's our new tagline for this this this show my brother my brother me just the marrow. Yeah, you know

07:14.280 --> 07:21.060
Oh, that's interesting. Just the marrow, but no, no, you misunderstand Justin the marrow doesn't come from outside the bone

07:21.060 --> 07:26.580
it's not ever gonna be just the marrow you're gonna have to put up with a lot of like 55 minutes of

07:26.980 --> 07:30.140
Three men gnawing and then maybe five

07:31.700 --> 07:35.100
Then a minute of marrow and then four minutes for ads and announcements

07:36.100 --> 07:39.460
Sounds like a good deal. I'm so glad you're sounding we now

07:40.540 --> 07:45.860
Griffin is continuing his streak of using a different mic from Travis and I just to be special and

07:45.860 --> 07:52.180
Unique my voice wasn't made to be condensed guys. It needs to be I have a more sort of dynamic personality

07:52.300 --> 07:54.300
My voice simply must be contained

07:55.460 --> 08:00.860
Safety of all this is not what I sound like in real life. This is only what I sound like in microphones in real life

08:00.860 --> 08:03.860
It's so good. You guys like listening to the Lord speak

08:03.860 --> 08:04.100
Yeah

08:04.100 --> 08:10.420
And if I do it without Metatron there to like for so which is what I call my microphone then everybody's ears would bleed

08:10.460 --> 08:15.780
Because it would be so buttery good and beautiful and I don't interrupt when I'm not on microphone

08:15.780 --> 08:20.020
The microphone makes me interrupt people when we say Travis has the voice of an angel

08:20.020 --> 08:22.220
We mean it in a sort of menacing

08:22.220 --> 08:27.940
Yeah way like a menacing through dangerous way and I can't I can't have that on my conscience anymore

08:27.940 --> 08:29.740
No, this is an advice show

08:29.740 --> 08:33.620
We are gonna I want to try to help more people today because I feel like the holidays are coming up

08:33.780 --> 08:39.140
It's good to be of service. I want a very close when this episode we were recording this one well in advance

08:39.140 --> 08:45.100
Yeah, so the holidays are even close like people are gonna think there's a deficit of candlelight spirit. It's not that we're just

08:45.100 --> 08:52.260
Like almost two weeks out. So I recently moved into student house and where I share a flat with 18 people own room

08:52.900 --> 08:57.540
Bathroom slash kitchen are shared. What a giant flat. It's a big

08:58.020 --> 09:03.780
Huge flat. Wait, are you the only one with their own room? Is it 17 people in one room and you?

09:04.300 --> 09:05.540
That's fucked up man

09:05.540 --> 09:13.420
Since I arrived late all the others got to know each other and started little traditions together one being brushing their teeth together every night. Oh

09:13.620 --> 09:14.740
I

09:14.740 --> 09:17.160
Like that actually a lot of people

09:17.980 --> 09:24.100
That's a lie. It would be a loud sound just the sound of 18 brushes going at it. Yeah quite loud

09:24.100 --> 09:29.700
I think it would vibrate the whole building if you're using even the gentlest quip. Yeah, sure. It's been uh,

09:30.660 --> 09:37.020
It's been three weeks and they haven't invited me yet. Mm-hmm. I had a brush. I don't even know how it started

09:37.340 --> 09:40.060
My question is how to get invited to their tooth brushing club

09:40.060 --> 09:45.820
do I ask outright or should I show up without saying anything and that's from at a loss in Amsterdam and

09:46.620 --> 09:52.460
This is PS. There's only two sinks and the group is around eight people. So it will be crowded

09:53.340 --> 09:55.340
Okay, wait a minute

09:56.020 --> 09:59.820
You've changed it with numbers you change this and this is why I don't like numbers

09:59.820 --> 10:03.120
Is that I thought I was following the plot pretty clearly here

10:03.180 --> 10:07.300
But the numbers at the end suggests that this is a rebel. Okay, is it pause?

10:07.300 --> 10:14.280
I wouldn't I want to take a second. Is it possible that this person mistyped the initial 18?

10:15.180 --> 10:17.180
because that is

10:17.540 --> 10:21.900
Quite a lot of people sharing a house. Is it possible?

10:22.660 --> 10:26.860
But then they did specify later the number again, which they had

10:27.180 --> 10:34.380
Yeah, if it's student housing we could be looking at more of like a dorm scenario where it's a large dorm building. Yeah

10:34.380 --> 10:39.260
Two sinks for 18 people. Yeah, I'm just gonna say that's on

10:40.140 --> 10:47.520
That's a lot with the amount of stuff your body makes in a given day that even when you put it in the right

10:47.660 --> 10:52.460
You know holes that go into the ground like the amount of residue

10:52.460 --> 10:56.300
I feel like I've lived with two people two other people before

10:56.820 --> 11:00.460
With two a kitchen sink in a bathroom sink and neither one of them

11:00.460 --> 11:06.820
Was acceptable what's acceptable in the eyes of the Lord or anyone who ever saw it either

11:06.820 --> 11:13.500
You know what this situation reminds me of what's that Trev? It's Terrace House. I always think about this of like the initial six

11:14.500 --> 11:17.720
Always like have time to like bond and do shit together

11:17.740 --> 11:24.420
And then like if you're the next person who comes in and you come in and like so oh you guys do a thing

11:24.420 --> 11:29.180
Oh, okay. Cool. Can I do no no, no, I can't do that. You guys already do the thing

11:29.180 --> 11:34.020
I would be a tradition guy. I would show up and be like I've got I've been watching on TV

11:34.020 --> 11:36.900
And I've got some great issues that I'd love to start with everybody

11:37.460 --> 11:41.060
Yeah, what do you think is the worst-case scenario of you?

11:41.060 --> 11:47.820
just like rolling up when you see them getting ready to do it and you just like bust out your toothbrush carrying case and

11:47.940 --> 11:49.940
You like open it up and you're a simple

11:50.500 --> 11:54.140
Elaborate toothbrush and you start brushing your teeth with them unbidden

11:54.140 --> 12:01.700
Yeah, I mean worst-case scenario is that they all turn and then they take their toothbrushes out and then they stab you with them

12:01.700 --> 12:06.460
Yeah, that's like worse. I guess that's the worst possible thing that could happen just below that

12:06.460 --> 12:12.020
I would say is all eight people stopping their toothbrushing exercise looking at you with a blank expression like

12:14.340 --> 12:20.980
Yeah, what are you doing like that's even worse this is our special perversion

12:20.980 --> 12:26.660
It is what it is. I think that it's weird to think that this perversion of

12:27.100 --> 12:33.580
Wanting to brush your teeth in a group also has the limitation of but don't but not more than eight people or else

12:33.580 --> 12:37.180
It's too wet wild and yucky. Maybe this is an accountability thing

12:39.160 --> 12:44.840
When it's late at night, maybe I'm a little bit I've been having a good time and I'm feeling a little relax party in

12:45.140 --> 12:49.820
Sometimes I want to give I want to cut loose a little bit. Okay, I'm 42

12:49.820 --> 12:54.660
Yeah, so for me that cutting loose may be like, you know, I'll get him in the morning

12:54.660 --> 12:58.000
You know to me just like a little treat to myself like you're already comfy

12:58.060 --> 13:02.940
You got your two race wrist braces on for your carpal tunnel already

13:03.140 --> 13:03.980
Yeah

13:03.980 --> 13:09.580
Your sleep mask with the Bluetooth in it cuz you're like a baby like that needs to be working in the matrix

13:09.700 --> 13:14.540
And maybe I got your super your super sloppy ASMR piped in. Yeah

13:14.540 --> 13:18.540
I got my wet my weighted blanket for my anxiety

13:18.540 --> 13:20.540
Yeah, yeah

13:20.780 --> 13:25.100
I'm not gonna unhook. I'm not gonna disengage from the sweet pot

13:25.100 --> 13:30.780
Yeah, sometimes you lay down your head hits the pillow and then you remember like oh I started there's a load of laundry in

13:30.780 --> 13:34.780
The washer I need to switch it and then you're like, yeah, I'll wash it again in the morning

13:35.060 --> 13:40.180
I'll just I'll just run it. It'll be fine. That stink comes out. The stink always comes out

13:40.180 --> 13:46.580
I think here's what you do next time that all eight of them are brushing you go and brush your teeth in the toilet

13:46.580 --> 13:52.140
I like using the toilet water. Don't be gross, but like they're brushing it looks crowded

13:52.140 --> 13:56.780
You get like a quick rinse and then you start brushing and kneel down

13:56.900 --> 14:04.000
Kneel down over the toilet or standing up looking down into the toilet. That's a really that's a really that's a really good question

14:04.740 --> 14:11.700
Straddling the toilet backwards using the reservoir in the back. Obviously, that's the cleanest water in the whole toilet

14:11.700 --> 14:16.660
I think with 18 people you need to look for every opportunity you can find to stand out. Yeah and being

14:17.340 --> 14:21.100
Maybe you're the one who every time you go into the bathroom to brush your teeth you

14:21.860 --> 14:26.620
stand over the toilet and peer deeply down into the bowl like you are seeing some sort of

14:27.060 --> 14:32.060
Like you're scrying some sort of suspended memory or future

14:32.580 --> 14:37.180
Future vision the hope would be that they would look at you and say like you don't need to do that

14:37.180 --> 14:42.660
Come on yeah, let's get over Jerry, but I didn't want a crowd

14:42.660 --> 14:46.820
There's like 18 or eight of us already in here. Yeah, I just don't crowd you guys

14:46.820 --> 14:52.200
So I'm actually fine in the toilet and then make them want it because they hate

14:54.260 --> 14:56.260
Show off all your elbow room

14:56.500 --> 15:00.340
Yeah, listen guys someone someone's got a brush your teeth in the toilet

15:00.340 --> 15:06.700
We could rotate out if you want, but you're gonna fight me for it. Yeah, I'm I love you guys

15:06.700 --> 15:10.060
I've only just met you much later than you met each other

15:10.060 --> 15:12.620
And I know you guys love each other and don't have that for me

15:12.620 --> 15:15.560
But I love you and so I'm willing to be the toilet one

15:16.620 --> 15:22.120
Yeah, I'll stand on I'll take that cross and put it on and I know you guys ate my wagyu beef admit it

15:22.120 --> 15:25.660
I know you ate my wagyu and now a special wagyu

15:25.660 --> 15:31.060
Did you use oil? You don't have to use oil. It's special fatty wagyu

15:31.060 --> 15:34.620
Hey, we're making a lot of deep terrace house. Yeah, we should move

15:35.580 --> 15:41.760
How about how about a wiki how from the wizard for this one? We got a jack into the computer space

15:43.940 --> 15:48.340
And this one's for gamers is a timely gamer. This is our second gamer

15:49.020 --> 15:51.020
This is another gamer one

15:51.020 --> 15:56.680
Right. We did it wasn't last one about how to shit talk how to shit talking gaming

15:56.680 --> 16:02.120
Well, it's yeah, I mean holiday season is when everybody gets the Xbox from their group from graham graham

16:02.680 --> 16:06.960
The hand me down the Xbox. I've used up it all the noobs. Don't

16:09.240 --> 16:14.440
I've got a I've got a 10-year morrow in to save on there. Don't touch it dipshit

16:14.440 --> 16:21.440
This one's how to create a Pokemon when and and and I think they're talking about the individual monsters not how to create your own

16:22.440 --> 16:26.520
Franchise like how to have the next but this is like how to create your own whole cloth

16:27.160 --> 16:28.520
Imagine yeah

16:28.520 --> 16:33.240
There's already so many of them. Yeah, there's like 900 of these fucking guys and

16:33.880 --> 16:36.760
But that's not for some people not enough

16:37.400 --> 16:42.200
Also, a lot of them aren't don't count a lot of them have only appeared in one game

16:42.200 --> 16:46.920
And then game freak in Nintendo. We're like, that's these are keys guys

16:47.080 --> 16:52.920
Somebody took Pokemon and made my keys and they're like that one's not coming put that one in the Disney vault

16:52.920 --> 16:58.040
We're not gonna do the keys one again. That was this is just a big garbage bag guys Griffin

16:58.040 --> 17:04.920
They're in Pokemon the concept of extinction like this. Oh that Pokemon went extinct. Well, there is right because there's like the

17:06.040 --> 17:08.040
The fossilized ones, right?

17:08.040 --> 17:15.560
Yeah, but then they can just plug them back into a cool machine and then a humanity's blight upon the planet can just be reversed

17:15.560 --> 17:18.440
I just don't know how I'd feel about them announcing one day like well

17:18.440 --> 17:22.120
There's no Pidgeys in this game because they were overhunted to the point of extinction

17:23.160 --> 17:26.360
We fought with them too hard killed them all. Can you blame us?

17:27.400 --> 17:29.400
Okay, so step one

17:29.400 --> 17:32.840
Choose what type of Pokemon you want like fire water grass, etc

17:32.840 --> 17:35.400
Keep in mind that better designs come out of more unique types

17:35.400 --> 17:40.760
For example, there are no poison slash steel types. Really steel steel is immune to poison

17:40.760 --> 17:45.160
I mean one of this article come out this made this. No, I mean it was updated a month ago

17:45.160 --> 17:48.040
So mine will be a psychic poison

17:48.680 --> 17:50.680
Yeah, they rot your mind away

17:51.240 --> 17:53.800
Oh, I do like that. How about this is good

17:53.800 --> 17:57.880
We can kind of polish it up over the course of the question. Justin. What kind of type is your Pokemon gonna be?

17:58.760 --> 17:59.720
Say

17:59.720 --> 18:03.240
This is gonna be a fun bit that Justin does where he pretends like he doesn't know great

18:03.240 --> 18:07.000
That Justin does where he pretends like he doesn't know Griffin just listed off a bunch of them

18:07.720 --> 18:09.560
thunder now

18:09.560 --> 18:14.920
Shock thunder type thunder thunder type emo thunder shock type, which is also my basketball name

18:15.720 --> 18:17.720
Okay

18:17.720 --> 18:19.720
I didn't even want to make that shot

18:22.760 --> 18:24.760
I don't care

18:24.760 --> 18:27.400
Mine's just normal buckets or mine's normal type

18:27.400 --> 18:33.240
Think of something you want the Pokemon to portray ghastly is based on gas. Piplup is best based on penguin

18:33.240 --> 18:37.960
Don't let this limit your creativity. However, a Pokemon like Skarmory is modeled after armor and a bird

18:38.760 --> 18:44.040
Obviously, but there are nuances in its design that aren't over the top and make it look unique yet still like a Pokemon

18:44.040 --> 18:49.960
I think I want to style my psychic poison one after just like a friend who's kind of a bad influence

18:51.240 --> 18:52.760
Okay

18:52.760 --> 18:55.640
So there I mean this would be continuing the grand tradition of

18:55.640 --> 18:58.600
continuing the grand tradition of Pokemon who are

18:59.560 --> 19:02.600
bi-bi-bipedal humanoid sort of yeah

19:02.760 --> 19:08.200
Just just kind of guys just a Pokemon that you really need to justify to your friends a lot before you pull it out

19:08.280 --> 19:11.720
Just like no once you get to know this book. I promise he's he's cool, man

19:11.800 --> 19:17.320
Like it's I know at first it's hard to get to know him, but trust me. He's a good guy underneath all that

19:17.320 --> 19:18.440
He's a good guy

19:18.440 --> 19:19.880
I know when I tap the button on this book

19:19.880 --> 19:23.640
Well, it's gonna look like a dude just comes out of here and that's gonna be fucked up to see

19:23.640 --> 19:28.360
I'm not going to lie to you, but it is important to know it's not a dude. It is a Pokemon

19:28.440 --> 19:30.440
His name is his name is

19:31.000 --> 19:37.720
Ted uh, and um, he does eat human food. Yeah, uh, but he loves it in here

19:37.720 --> 19:39.720
He loves it in these little guys

19:39.880 --> 19:45.320
I watched a tiktok on the McElroy family tiktok channel and it was a clip from a bim bam

19:45.720 --> 19:51.720
And it was uh about pokemon and I watched the whole tiktok and it was just you guys going off

19:51.720 --> 19:55.080
And I kept waiting. I was like, all right

19:55.800 --> 19:57.800
When's jayman gonna bring the thunder?

19:58.680 --> 20:02.040
I mean usually he comes in he's sitting back like a sniper

20:03.240 --> 20:07.240
Yeah, one of those where you waited to the very end to come dunking in like Shaquille O'Neal

20:07.240 --> 20:10.760
I watched the whole tiktok and then it started back over again and I didn't get a hand on that

20:11.080 --> 20:13.960
Uh, maybe you will the next time you watch it. Maybe the second loop

20:14.040 --> 20:17.800
Yeah, you know for the frequency with which we discuss pokemon in this show

20:17.800 --> 20:21.480
It is wild to think only two-thirds of us have any interest in it

20:21.720 --> 20:27.960
And of those two-thirds only one is a passing interest like and what's infuriating to continue this this

20:28.360 --> 20:34.600
Triune venn diagram. Justin actually knows shit about pokemon, but he plays a character on tv that honey

20:34.680 --> 20:39.800
I swear to god. I swear to god to you. I won't pretend I don't that part

20:39.960 --> 20:43.000
I have played them but like you've driven right?

20:43.000 --> 20:49.800
You've driven around. Is there a drive? But when you lived in austin that you made constantly right? Like you've driven past this like

20:50.360 --> 20:51.400
uh

20:51.400 --> 20:57.240
Abandoned pawn shop, you know three times a day. What does it look like? It's like I don't know i've i've

20:57.720 --> 21:02.200
Shuffled that off. I may room for other things. I don't keep it but to

21:02.680 --> 21:07.960
Continue the analogy though. If i'm driving past this abandoned pawn shop, I would look inside and see you

21:08.520 --> 21:12.440
Kind of just like squirreling away little treasures into your into your shirt

21:12.440 --> 21:14.840
And be like, oh justin loves that pawn shop

21:15.320 --> 21:20.040
I paid my daughter to play the new pokemon game. So I didn't have to play it for besties. Thank you

21:20.440 --> 21:24.600
Okay, choose a name for the pokemon justin your excuse from the bay if you want to go no no

21:24.600 --> 21:29.160
No, I want to continue with the bit. I feel bad. I don't have like cool

21:29.720 --> 21:32.120
Cool stuff to say that's all I feel guilty

21:32.840 --> 21:38.280
Well, just take the stuff that travis says and then try to put your own sort of twisted skew. Okay, got it. Yes. Yes. Yes

21:38.520 --> 21:40.520
Okay, my pokemon's name

21:40.520 --> 21:45.480
My psychic poison, uh problematic friend is named doug bader

21:46.120 --> 21:51.000
Because it's a combination of doug and the fact that he likes to debate everybody about everything

21:51.400 --> 21:53.400
Oh, I like that and he comes out and he's just like

21:55.240 --> 22:01.800
Doug bader. Yeah, like what doug bader this dude only says his own name. Oh my god guys guys guys

22:01.880 --> 22:03.880
I'm, so sorry. This is my pokemon doug bader

22:05.000 --> 22:06.600
He got out

22:06.600 --> 22:11.880
Again, I swear to god he loves it in here. He's got a little home gym doug bader. Yeah

22:12.280 --> 22:17.400
I actually have my uh degree in urban planning. I have a master's in it. Oh doug bader doug bader doug bader

22:17.800 --> 22:19.320
What why would you?

22:19.320 --> 22:24.280
I mean nobody has to argue. He's arguing you don't need to insert yourself into this doug bader

22:24.280 --> 22:27.160
He just said that he has a master's in urban plan

22:27.160 --> 22:34.280
Um doug bader doug bader doug bader try what you try what you want the pokemon doug bader to look like

22:38.280 --> 22:45.240
Doug bader just always has one finger up and he's going doug bader. Oh, that's good one moment one moment

22:45.640 --> 22:49.480
Uh, he's like a squished ruffalo kind of like if you take ruffalo

22:49.880 --> 22:54.680
You know how ruffalo is like perfect and you just squished him kind of yeah, you squished him down

22:54.680 --> 22:59.880
Like a ruffalo that's a copy of a copy of a copy of a ruffalo. Multiplicity ruffalo. Thank you

23:00.920 --> 23:08.520
Okay, it's when you squish him down. Does he keep his dimensions the ratio no more like one of those hydraulic press

23:09.240 --> 23:14.840
Once again to reference tiktok videos as you put you put ruffalo in there, but you stopped about halfway down

23:15.160 --> 23:17.800
So there's just a little bit of ruffalo coming out the sides

23:17.800 --> 23:24.600
Don't let it go too far or else ruffalo will momentarily disappear and then shoot up in an incredible ruffalo cone

23:24.920 --> 23:31.640
That is indiscernible for hi guys. We wrapped 1000 rubber bands around this ruffalo. You won't believe what happens next

23:33.560 --> 23:37.880
And ask yourself this do you want the pokemon to evolve or is it a non-evolutionary or legend

23:37.880 --> 23:39.880
No, doug bader never changes

23:40.520 --> 23:42.520
He does not have the capacity to grow

23:42.520 --> 23:48.760
I like that because then in a future generation we can decide to add a pre-evolution of doug bader

23:49.080 --> 23:52.920
That's just called like I mean doug or dougie bader

23:53.320 --> 23:55.320
uh, and then when he

23:55.720 --> 24:02.120
Dougie bates gets old and becomes doug bader and then maybe he has a third evolution where he becomes dr. Douglas bader

24:03.000 --> 24:09.400
Now to reach that point you do have to introduce the rogan stone the rogan stone will force the evolution into dr

24:09.400 --> 24:11.000
douglas bader

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
Uh think of the moves it can learn

24:13.800 --> 24:18.760
I can help you guys come up with I mean, there's a lot. I mean there's poison tail tail tail tail whip

24:19.480 --> 24:22.520
That's one tail whip. I like doug bader just shakes his little booty

24:24.040 --> 24:26.040
Just shakes his little tushy. I like that

24:26.520 --> 24:27.720
uh

24:27.720 --> 24:29.560
Use mansplain

24:29.560 --> 24:33.480
That could be a psychic type move except it's not one and I would love us to so I can create

24:33.480 --> 24:40.680
A doug bader from whole cloth, but the idea of creating specialized moves irks you the problem is you could create a specialized move

24:41.080 --> 24:46.920
Teach it to pikachu. He becomes godlike like there's one that you could give poke like pikachu a move

24:47.480 --> 24:49.560
That would make him invincible

24:51.880 --> 24:57.480
Use use eat other pokemon god, I wish I'd said a pokemon other than pikachu. I mean, it's just like

24:58.280 --> 25:01.720
Just any other pokemon would have been great here. I'll give you like so much funnier

25:01.720 --> 25:04.280
Why don't I tell you some and then you say some out loud?

25:04.280 --> 25:07.960
We'll get some good takes and then rachel can like chop and screw it so that it sounds like, you know

25:08.040 --> 25:10.840
Good ones so gar chomp gar chomp

25:11.640 --> 25:16.680
Try and try give just yeah, don't say it like you're in a french restaurant trying to get the waiter's attention gar chomp

25:18.840 --> 25:20.840
Pardon me gar chomp

25:23.560 --> 25:26.520
Is this supposed to be room temperature butter because uh

25:27.640 --> 25:31.000
Not loving it. And if the baguettes are not coming soon, uh

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
Uh lay tip may be affected

25:34.200 --> 25:36.680
Gar chomp, that's good. Um

25:37.720 --> 25:43.560
So this is up in the air bread. Sorry. Say cup holder con con cup holder

25:44.440 --> 25:45.720
cup holder

25:45.720 --> 25:47.720
cup holder

25:51.880 --> 25:54.040
This is good, this is good

25:54.840 --> 25:58.920
This is a play. It's fun in the space. It's good. Okay, I think it's good in here

25:58.920 --> 26:01.960
Let me let me duck my head through this curtain and see if there's anything

26:02.440 --> 26:07.960
Um, it's a pokemon that has cup holders built into it and just walks around with you

26:09.400 --> 26:11.240
And carries your drink

26:11.240 --> 26:15.880
Now can it do hot drinks? I can't hear your sound. Can it do hot drinks justin?

26:16.360 --> 26:19.000
What it can but you can see it wincing

26:20.040 --> 26:22.040
Oh, no

26:22.040 --> 26:28.680
Yeah, that's good and he can pop out of his ball that would be cool too what about like ice chest but it's a

26:29.160 --> 26:32.440
It stores your drink. It keeps hot drinks hot and cold drinks cold

26:33.000 --> 26:37.660
I like the idea of just a cup holder pokemon that pops out and he's like chevrolet equinox

26:38.280 --> 26:41.960
It's like this is my pokemon chevrolet equinox and then doug bader gets in

26:43.160 --> 26:46.680
And drives the other pokemon doug bader. This doesn't make any sense

26:46.680 --> 26:53.480
Um, and he holds up his license doug bader and then the license says

26:55.560 --> 26:58.840
Yeah, yeah, that's good too it's pokemon all the way down do this

26:59.880 --> 27:06.280
Lightning round real quick. If you want extra credit add catch rate to doug bader real quick. Just a number one

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
Six, okay

27:09.000 --> 27:10.680
gender ratio

27:10.680 --> 27:12.680
Oh a hundred percent

27:12.680 --> 27:16.280
100 male and he's insistent on that. Yeah

27:16.980 --> 27:23.640
Announces it loudly. Yeah. Wow, doug bader is a is a rough customer species name like help for his pronouns

27:23.640 --> 27:25.640
He says i'm all dude

27:26.360 --> 27:34.120
Yeah, that's the worst it's the worst. Okay. Pokedex number 69. Yep. Yeah egg egg groups

27:35.720 --> 27:40.280
What's in this one's you justin how what's the egg group farm raised

27:40.280 --> 27:41.640
Yes

27:41.640 --> 27:43.320
hatch time

27:43.320 --> 27:45.320
Always always a party

27:46.020 --> 27:47.320
Height weight

27:47.320 --> 27:53.000
Um, and then I I guess this last q a it does say can I sell my pokemon ideas to the company?

27:53.560 --> 27:57.800
You can try they may not do anything with it, but it's a good idea to share anyway, so um

27:58.360 --> 28:00.360
I'm open to it by the way

28:00.920 --> 28:06.840
If nintendo is listening and I know they are and they're like, oh I like doug bader challenging

28:06.840 --> 28:11.020
Challenging challenging ideas. I'm willing to sell doug bader for a premium

28:11.740 --> 28:13.740
i'm already having

28:13.740 --> 28:19.660
An anxiety attack thinking about being in a live show and i'm going to look for my uh, uh

28:20.700 --> 28:27.020
A lime scooter to get home on and I run into a listener who's at the show and they pull back their uh, uh

28:27.340 --> 28:31.900
Hoodie to show off their doug bader t-shirt that we definitely sold them

28:31.900 --> 28:38.480
And they look at me with anticipation and I give them the blankest possible. The t-shirt will need to say justin

28:39.260 --> 28:41.260
This is from that time

28:41.820 --> 28:43.820
It was a pit that you did

28:44.220 --> 28:50.460
What can can I get three clean? What are you guys in your head? What is doug? How does doug bader say his own name?

28:51.580 --> 28:53.580
doug bader

28:53.980 --> 28:55.980
doug bader

28:56.300 --> 28:58.780
doug bader doug bader

28:58.780 --> 29:00.700
Bader

29:00.700 --> 29:04.300
I like that one doug bader. Oh, that's what he's like

29:04.860 --> 29:06.860
Playing basketball. Yeah

29:07.020 --> 29:12.780
Then he's emo thunder you guys want to hear another question could come in like mike jones does on a track where he's just like

29:14.460 --> 29:20.940
Doug bader like yells it pretty loud. Yeah, that's or you could do like a jason derulo thing doug bader

29:21.740 --> 29:25.260
Uh, my partner surprised me and packed up all our fall decorations this year

29:25.260 --> 29:32.300
When I asked where the two real mini pumpkins from the grocery store went they responded which pumpkins all of them look fake

29:35.900 --> 29:37.820
Brothers what do I do?

29:37.820 --> 29:43.980
I don't want to undo their hard work, but I also don't want to possibly create a stinky situation for next year not possibly

29:44.840 --> 29:49.020
Definitely. Well, I can't remember if I already threw the real money pumpkins out or not context

29:49.020 --> 29:54.380
There are eight perfectly packed boxes with everything wrapped in newspaper already on the garage top shelf

29:54.380 --> 30:01.760
That's from stinker treat in socal. Wow. Well, oh wait. Okay, hold on reaction. That's a lot of fall time decorations

30:02.300 --> 30:04.300
Good news. Okay

30:04.780 --> 30:06.220
at worst

30:06.220 --> 30:09.040
It's only a quarter of those boxes that will be contaminated

30:09.500 --> 30:15.260
It will not reach beyond if there's one pumpkin in one box and another pumpkin in another box and there's eight boxes

30:15.580 --> 30:17.820
That means six untouched boxes

30:17.820 --> 30:23.980
That's a good point potentially seven maybe both pumpkins ended up in the same box and then it's like

30:24.540 --> 30:27.180
That maybe whatever's in that eighth one who gives a shit

30:27.980 --> 30:30.780
you you raise a good point, but like if you can

30:31.820 --> 30:37.500
So if you can save future you from opening a box of puke like this is what you'll have right?

30:37.580 --> 30:41.420
You'll have like it's already a pain decorations in and out who cares?

30:41.900 --> 30:44.860
But then you open one that's like just vomit and trash

30:44.860 --> 30:49.740
That's that's sad. You don't want or even worse. It could attract pests

30:50.300 --> 30:54.460
And the only animal I know that loves to eat pumpkins is a porco upine

30:54.860 --> 31:01.100
So maybe that could actually be great. You set a little porco upine, uh nest up in the in the oh, yeah

31:01.500 --> 31:03.500
But the infestation will follow

31:04.140 --> 31:08.380
Every every dirty animal loves to get their their paws on

31:09.180 --> 31:11.660
Rotten pumpkins. I feel like that's a big draw

31:11.660 --> 31:17.500
I don't want to disparage your partner here, but i've picked up real pumpkins and i've picked up fake pumpkins

31:17.980 --> 31:23.900
And the difference between the two is noticeable not many pumpkins many pumpkins

31:23.900 --> 31:29.500
Are we talking about the little gourds that are like that small because I think those things last forever

31:29.580 --> 31:36.220
They maybe could hang I feel like the tiny little gourds could hang they have very little juice inside. There's no juice

31:36.220 --> 31:41.660
There's not much pumpkin juice in the little ones if you try to ever eat one of those like a like an apple

31:42.220 --> 31:44.220
Uh, there's not a lot of juice to go around

31:44.860 --> 31:46.860
Have you I think you're good. Did you do that?

31:48.140 --> 31:51.900
My daughter's decorated two pumpkins with like paint and stuff this year

31:51.900 --> 31:54.860
And they're still sitting on our porch because I can't quite puzzle this one out

31:55.340 --> 31:58.380
Can't quite figure it out what to do with these guys. Oh you throw them away

31:59.020 --> 32:03.660
Yeah, but they really like they're really proud of them. Oh, yeah, sometimes though. You got to teach hard lessons

32:03.660 --> 32:07.020
It's true. Take a picture of it. Take a picture

32:08.620 --> 32:13.580
I have to be careful. My daughter made a cat out of trash when she was three and it's still in her

32:14.380 --> 32:18.700
Yeah, that is a good trash cat. Wait, which wait, which daughter?

32:19.980 --> 32:21.980
What well, I mean charlie

32:22.380 --> 32:25.020
Yeah, that was she was three a long time ago

32:25.900 --> 32:31.100
Uh, yeah trash cat's been there a long time and i'm not like he's got a fucking stupid

32:31.100 --> 32:36.380
Diet, dr. Pepper body and a cool whip tub head and I hate him. He's been in my house longer

32:37.100 --> 32:42.140
You know, she he's in the house longer than cooper has it's more trash cats home than cooper's

32:42.460 --> 32:46.220
Does she routinely check up on trash cat to make sure he's still around?

32:46.620 --> 32:50.540
You want to hear some fucking wild slumdog millionaire shit. It's like last year

32:50.860 --> 32:53.260
She had a project where she had to make a recycled toy

32:53.900 --> 32:55.900
And she didn't tell us about it

32:56.140 --> 32:59.980
And then like the morning of she's like, oh I was supposed to make a recycled toy

32:59.980 --> 33:06.300
And guess who was there trash cat and I was like, this is amazing. We're finally I can't believe it

33:06.300 --> 33:11.260
We saved trash cat for a reason but then after that I kind of felt like

33:11.820 --> 33:15.420
It's time for funeral with a friend, you know, like yeah, sure served his part

33:15.500 --> 33:19.580
Like this is what he was put here for his unfinished business. Like where was that?

33:19.660 --> 33:21.900
Where was that character in charlotte's web?

33:22.220 --> 33:28.300
That's like after the pig put the thing in the in the web like wow, that's amazing. Well completed his purpose

33:28.300 --> 33:30.540
I guess wait, why are y'all looking at me like this?

33:31.260 --> 33:34.540
What i'm just saying he put the thing in the web pretty cool. He did it so

33:35.020 --> 33:41.260
But that is charlotte's web. She's like she spins. She makes a picture so good with her ass that she could die

33:41.660 --> 33:44.220
That's it. Yeah, she makes the picture to save

33:45.020 --> 33:48.460
Wilbur right and she does it so good. She's allowed to die

33:49.020 --> 33:56.780
Travis is saying that in this story wilbur gets the blue ribbon and the farmer is like wow damn first place. Great job pig you have

33:56.780 --> 34:01.740
Yeah, you're done now. You did you did what all things can aspire to

34:02.540 --> 34:04.540
It doesn't get better than this

34:04.620 --> 34:06.620
You are now sandwiches

34:06.700 --> 34:10.220
After charlotte kicks it. Do you how long do you think before they're like?

34:10.540 --> 34:15.740
Hey that pig hasn't spun any more webs in a while. You notice that is he done. Can we

34:16.460 --> 34:17.580
can we

34:17.580 --> 34:18.860
stop

34:18.860 --> 34:21.820
His whole thing if that was you just reminded me

34:21.820 --> 34:28.540
Of this wild thing that like a talking animal is one thing but humans who are like god

34:28.540 --> 34:35.260
That's a cool web must have been a cool pig that did it. Yeah, and no one's like some pig in it. It says some pig

34:36.300 --> 34:39.820
He's braggy, but I guess he can he shoots webs out of his ass

34:40.700 --> 34:45.820
Hey, uh wilbur. Listen, some people came by we need you to make another web. Okay, buddy

34:45.820 --> 34:52.960
Nobody believes us, please. It's in six months. You haven't even a single web out of your pig ass, please

34:55.420 --> 34:58.700
I'm just saying he maybe had three months. I've just been big spider ham fans

34:58.780 --> 35:03.980
Maybe that was it. Like I can't believe spider spider ham secret identity is wilbur the pig at our farm

35:04.540 --> 35:06.540
We can't eat this delicious boy

35:06.780 --> 35:09.580
It would have been cool if before charlotte

35:09.580 --> 35:16.300
It goofed wilbur was like real quick before you beef it. Can you just write on a web?

35:17.420 --> 35:20.540
uh, I need hamburgers and then

35:21.740 --> 35:26.540
Then you can die like I like I need hamburgers comma there's gonna be a long one

35:26.780 --> 35:28.780
But what else you gotta do?

35:29.100 --> 35:30.780
You get your kids on it

35:30.780 --> 35:35.020
I need hamburgers comma, and then i'm retiring from web making forever

35:35.500 --> 35:38.380
do you think if do you think he ever had a moment where he's like

35:38.380 --> 35:40.380
Like I don't want to be

35:40.700 --> 35:44.940
Kind of a shithead, but you misspelled retiring. I do need you to get up there and fix this

35:45.020 --> 35:47.100
I don't want them to think i'm a dumb magic pig

35:47.180 --> 35:51.260
I want to think i'm a smart magic and if you could have it on my desk my end of day thursday

35:51.340 --> 35:54.060
That would be just fantastic bad news charlotte

35:54.140 --> 36:00.940
I know it's christmas eve, but pepsico just paid for a branded web and you gotta crank that out by dawn

36:01.260 --> 36:05.580
You're gonna be here with a street team. Jamie kennedy's involved

If you could do that make it look like the notes app in the web, that would be great. I love that

36:46.140 --> 36:49.740
Hey charlotte, I lost it all on crypto. So i'm gonna need you

But you gotta do it

38:35.220 --> 38:37.220

Jordan crucial of the host of feeling scene where we talk about the movie characters that make us feel see and I'm the show's producer

43:03.200 --> 43:07.680
Marissa Jordan, you've interviewed so many directors actors writers film critics

43:07.680 --> 43:13.600
And I like to play this little game where I take a sip of coffee every time someone says that's such a great question

43:13.880 --> 43:17.520
That's such a fabulous question or they tell you how smart you are

43:17.520 --> 43:24.080
I think that you are rather brilliant. And of course the big one is when they cry unexpectedly. Yes, Jordan

43:24.080 --> 43:28.920
I don't want to cry on your podcast. I wasn't expecting to cry. I mean, it makes me kind of want to cry

43:29.680 --> 43:36.740
Feeling scene comes out every Thursday on maximum fun.org. Listen already. What are you waiting for Jordan? That's such a great question

43:36.740 --> 43:41.740
You

How Lapland here with breaking news on a revolutionary form of entertainment professional wrestling

43:49.340 --> 43:52.300
For more we go to our correspondent Danielle Radford

43:52.740 --> 43:59.100
Professional wrestling is the craze that's sweeping the nation featuring fisticuffs and colorful costumes

43:59.100 --> 44:02.460
But who can help us make sense of this world of body slams?

44:02.460 --> 44:07.860
Lindsay kelk has the answer sources tell us of an amazing podcast called tights and fights

44:08.020 --> 44:15.140
filled with discussions of the absurdity of professional wrestling plus all the sincerity and hilarity that you could shake a stick at

44:16.660 --> 44:24.780
Listen to the tights and fights podcast every week find it on maximum fun or wherever you get your podcasts and your old-timey radio

44:24.780 --> 44:27.780
You

44:29.820 --> 44:34.100
Another question another question. All right, you're the boss

44:34.980 --> 44:41.420
Three years ago. I went to my first candle nights white elephant gift to change at my job. I was gifted a cartoonish

44:42.300 --> 44:45.380
Ten-gallon cowboy hat crafted entirely from Bud Light beer cases

44:46.020 --> 44:49.280
So it's fun. It's cold thinking nothing of it

44:49.280 --> 44:55.220
I re-gifted it to my father-in-law now after the pandemic folks at work are asking about the hat trying to track it down

44:55.340 --> 45:01.220
Apparently was a re-gift fixture of the Christmas parties. Oh, and my boss's boss

45:01.820 --> 45:03.340
misses it

45:03.340 --> 45:08.320
Brothers, it's been three years and I don't even know if my father-in-law has the hat. What do I do?

45:08.380 --> 45:14.740
That's from hatless in Houston. I mean the obvious first answer is ask your father-in-law if he still has the hat

45:14.740 --> 45:20.180
We have to assume that's happened already. No. Yeah, actually we don't there's a lot of I would not

45:20.180 --> 45:24.300
I mean my father-in-law. I don't think I would ask Tommy like you got that hat

45:24.300 --> 45:29.060
I gave you that would be well, there's no fucking way Tommy would get rid of a cool

45:29.140 --> 45:33.180
Bud Light that's true. That's he's a man of taste and distinction. He will be good

45:33.180 --> 45:36.260
I had around now I will say I know I flippantly said just ask your father

45:36.260 --> 45:41.740
But you do run the risk of if the answer is no if your father-in-law is the type of person that's like

45:41.740 --> 45:49.220
gonna one tell you he got rid of a gift you gave him and two does he then feel bad now that you've asked so

45:49.220 --> 45:51.980
You've introduced guilt into the mix as well

45:52.900 --> 45:56.100
Yeah, it's like pay it backward. It's like this is now you're now

45:56.100 --> 46:01.340
This is your burden this guilt that I feel now is also yours. I don't know if it helps you

46:01.340 --> 46:03.020
We're family question asker

46:03.020 --> 46:07.460
I don't know if this helps you but I think it's real messed up for someone to give you a gift and

46:07.460 --> 46:14.460
And like at a white elephant exchange without telling you the context of like and next time you'll pass this on to somebody else

46:14.460 --> 46:16.980
And then just expecting you to assume that

46:17.540 --> 46:25.980
What you didn't know is this cartoonishly oversized 10-gallon hat made out of Bud Light cases is very important to our company

46:26.800 --> 46:33.560
You could tell him actually I gave it to my father-in-law so he could regift it at another party and their party

46:33.560 --> 46:40.960
Doesn't have as much around the holidays. It really means a lot to him. It really meant a lot to help them to have a special

46:41.720 --> 46:43.840
Budweiser hat that they could pass around well

46:43.840 --> 46:49.040
You see I was wearing the hat because I cherished it so much when I was walking by and I saw a burning building and there

46:49.040 --> 46:55.400
Were children inside and I rushed him to save them and the hat valiantly gave its life to protect me from a falling beam

46:55.600 --> 47:00.860
It was actually really sad my father-in-law. I gave him the hat and he gave me

47:00.860 --> 47:09.300
24 loose Bud Light cans that had no container, and it's like that's Christmas. You know that's that's Christmas

47:10.420 --> 47:16.680
I gave it to my father-in-law and he ate it. Can you make a new hat out of whatever the Bud Light cans look

47:16.940 --> 47:20.260
The case looks like now obviously it's gonna be different

47:20.260 --> 47:24.180
But if you bring it in and somebody be like this is a different hat you'd be like yeah

47:24.740 --> 47:26.740
This one's light

47:26.740 --> 47:33.100
This is a light hat. This is an 11-gallon hat. This is Bud Select 11 gallons

47:33.100 --> 47:37.360
This is a much nicer hat. Give this to your boss's boss. Tell him it's a nicer hat in every way

47:37.460 --> 47:40.320
It was featured in Southern Style magazine

47:41.100 --> 47:44.660
Maybe you just go around to everybody in the office and say hey I

47:45.780 --> 47:50.580
Threw away the hat and I'm sorry and here's a $15 gift card to Sheetz

47:50.580 --> 47:58.500
If you do that with everybody. Everyone? What if it's a large company? There's only six people. Yeah, it'll be fine

47:58.860 --> 48:00.860
Yeah, that's a possibility. What?

48:01.420 --> 48:04.300
How do you know that? That's so funny that you asked that

48:04.980 --> 48:13.180
You checked LinkedIn. What? You checked LinkedIn. I interned with the company for a couple summers

48:13.180 --> 48:17.240
Yeah, it was tough. It was a tough environment. Did you ever get the hat?

48:17.240 --> 48:21.960
Ah, did you guys ever see Boiler Room with Vin Diesel? All the time. Fuck yeah

48:22.520 --> 48:26.960
Yeah, it's it was I'm just saying it's a sick flick. Yeah, I've seen it all the time

48:27.360 --> 48:31.180
Yeah, that was when you had you had a pretty long commute, right? Cuz where are they based?

48:31.760 --> 48:33.280
hmm

48:33.280 --> 48:35.280
Where were they based? Yeah

48:35.760 --> 48:40.580
Go ahead say it. Scanlan. Scanlan's. Oh

48:42.320 --> 48:45.440
Oh, that's the good part. Scanlanburg, Maryland

48:45.440 --> 48:47.120
Okay, yeah

48:47.120 --> 48:49.120
And what and what do they make?

48:49.200 --> 48:55.480
Hmm, what do they make? What do they do? They make life easier for a lot of really deserving customers every day

48:55.480 --> 49:00.800
Okay, as long as there's not more than six customers that need assistance. So what's

49:01.720 --> 49:03.920
What specifically did you do?

49:04.420 --> 49:09.720
My what was your day to day life? My job there? Yeah. Yeah, I was the I was the honeycomb guy

49:09.720 --> 49:13.200
I was the guy who would come after they put the honey in the jars

49:13.200 --> 49:17.760
I was like I would come and reclaim the comb and suck whatever honey I could out of it

49:17.760 --> 49:21.680
And then I was a paid position. It was an internship

49:21.680 --> 49:22.960
I mean, but I was paid in honey

49:22.960 --> 49:25.860
So I would suck the honey out of the combs that they couldn't squish out

49:25.960 --> 49:31.720
Yeah, and now those in bottles to sell like discount stores from your mouth to the bottle. I had a

49:32.440 --> 49:34.440
like a dental dam like a

49:35.480 --> 49:37.980
Was there a risk of in there what?

49:37.980 --> 49:45.100
Oh, there's always a risk of bees. Sorry. That's not it's no different from any other job any I could work on a freighter

49:45.100 --> 49:48.180
You know when I was out in Alaska and the crabbing ships and stuff

49:48.180 --> 49:51.460
Yeah, you didn't ask them about bees, but bees were a constant problem

49:51.700 --> 49:58.220
They go on the ship who knows when you're in port at a spooly like flour or y'all

49:58.500 --> 50:03.180
Yeah, sure. Did you guys have a ship's be like they used to have ships cats what?

50:04.100 --> 50:06.540
won't be bees can't live in the ocean if they

50:06.540 --> 50:09.200
If you take a bee in the ocean, it dies

50:10.180 --> 50:16.940
I love Justin how sort of the info you were giving us about your job went from being not specific at all to I sucked

50:16.940 --> 50:18.660
honey

50:18.660 --> 50:25.220
Sucked honey. I would shotgun honey out of the the nest and then spit it into jars to be sold at Dollar General

50:25.300 --> 50:30.420
I found that helpful for me to know what you were talking about. Yeah, I feel like a little context

50:30.420 --> 50:33.340
I didn't they said it was top secret the work I was doing

50:34.100 --> 50:35.540
but

50:35.540 --> 50:42.020
Government safe safe place. What was it government work? I really I've said too much. I've said too much

50:42.020 --> 50:45.060
We should ask another question. That would be ideal. I think

50:47.500 --> 50:49.500
Hey

50:52.380 --> 50:54.380
I want a munch

50:56.660 --> 50:58.660
Baby I want to

50:58.660 --> 51:01.620
Munch bop bop bop bop bop

51:02.700 --> 51:08.860
Welcome munch squad. It's a podcast within a podcast profiling latest and greatest in brand eating and folks. I'm

51:09.500 --> 51:15.220
So excited to tell you we've talked about the subway series if you know this the subway series is not

51:16.380 --> 51:21.340
The the Yankees versus the Mets like that. It's a subway series in New York

51:21.340 --> 51:27.300
This is a subway series that subway does where basically they were like, we're tired of making so many different sandwich

51:27.300 --> 51:31.860
Yeah, here's 12 of them. Yeah, please don't order other things other than this

51:31.860 --> 51:38.860
These are the easiest 12 sandwiches to make we can't teach people how to make 13 fucking sandwiches guys

51:38.900 --> 51:44.340
We're tired. We're tired of this. We're tired of this. So we have we now have

51:47.420 --> 51:50.460
Subway creates footlongs made from cookies, huh?

51:50.460 --> 51:58.060
Huh? Subway the brand this is gonna trip the brand that sells more freshly baked cookies than any other

51:58.420 --> 52:01.220
Restaurant company in the United that can't be true

52:01.980 --> 52:08.060
Now my buy a cookie every time I go to I'm just saying that there's like the great American cookie company where their whole deal

52:08.500 --> 52:10.860
It's cookies. Subway is the number one

52:11.940 --> 52:16.340
Fast food franchise in America. There's more subways than anything else. They're number one

52:16.340 --> 52:22.820
So it would make sense that they sold cookies. They're the number one cookie place, but let's we're getting hung up on

52:23.420 --> 52:25.420
inspired by the Subway series

52:25.860 --> 52:31.380
Signature subs cookie lovers can sink their teeth into four limited edition footlong flavors

52:32.140 --> 52:39.520
Exclusively at cookie way the brand's pop-up restaurant that serves only its fan favorite cookies for so let's talk about

52:40.640 --> 52:44.640
Let's talk about you restaurant a restaurant that sells just the four cookies

52:44.640 --> 52:51.360
First up is the Subway cookie club. Just like the perfect combination of proteins on some ways number 11, which is

52:52.880 --> 52:55.200
Ham roast beef and turkey

52:56.160 --> 52:58.160
but this one has

52:58.160 --> 53:00.160
double chocolate favorites

53:00.160 --> 53:04.640
Just like the perfect combination of proteins the Subway cookie club stacks cookies on I say

53:04.640 --> 53:11.640
protein with a double chocolate cookie base and vanilla frosting then topped with chocolate chip white chocolate macadamia and raspberry cheesecake

53:11.640 --> 53:17.440
cookie chunks rainbow sprinkles and chocolate raspberry sauce the Mexicali

53:17.800 --> 53:24.620
Whoa inspired by the south of the border flavor of the number seven the Mexicali starts with a vanilla sugar cookie based

53:25.020 --> 53:28.680
Smothered in dulce de leche then topped with mole and corn nuts

53:29.120 --> 53:33.760
Drizzled with white chocolate sauce and finished with ground coffee tahini and espresso chips

53:33.760 --> 53:38.280
I think I would I don't you guys that's long enough not being able to see these bad boys

53:38.280 --> 53:45.960
Let me just hook you up real quick. That's a lot. That's a lot of flavors. Yeah, it's a complex cookie experience

53:45.960 --> 53:47.960
It's a lot of flavors and textures

53:48.840 --> 53:50.840
You guys seeing this

53:51.480 --> 53:54.020
Is it loaded for you seeing it no

53:54.800 --> 53:57.480
It also bothers me to think about oh

53:58.040 --> 53:59.560
my lord

53:59.560 --> 54:03.040
Holy shit gang juice are cooking oats

54:03.040 --> 54:09.960
It's a footlong I mean it's a footlong it's a footlong sub it's a footlong cookie sub

54:11.480 --> 54:18.160
Can you describe for the listeners Griffin what they know I can't describe what for the listener I can't at all

54:18.160 --> 54:20.160
It's I mean if I might attempt

54:20.520 --> 54:21.520
imagine

54:21.520 --> 54:24.360
you have a plank of cookie and then

54:24.960 --> 54:29.320
you loaded a bunch of toppings into a cannon and

54:29.320 --> 54:32.120
And from about eight feet away

54:32.800 --> 54:33.760
launched

54:33.760 --> 54:38.640
Said toppings at your plank of cookie and then a man on a 30-foot high ladder

54:39.720 --> 54:42.720
attempted to drizzle stuff on them

54:43.320 --> 54:50.020
This looks like a family double dare challenge in cookie form if I could try if I could try I think it looks like an open

54:50.120 --> 54:53.480
casket funeral for some gorp made by a psychopath

54:54.000 --> 54:55.760
Yeah

54:55.760 --> 55:01.320
Trav look at can you are you able to zoom? Can you see the cookies with any level of specificity? Yes

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
Okay, I'm actually

55:04.840 --> 55:08.320
You know what? I'm gonna send you I'm gonna put a link to this image in

55:08.880 --> 55:15.480
The in the chat, right? Sorry, so you you can just look at this image because I need you to

55:16.760 --> 55:22.180
Look at this and guess for me what you think is on the number two cookie

55:22.180 --> 55:29.140
Is that the second from the bottom or the second from the second from the top? Oh my lord Justin just looking at it pickles

55:29.980 --> 55:31.340
peanut butter

55:31.340 --> 55:33.340
potato chips

55:33.820 --> 55:35.380
Strawberries

55:35.380 --> 55:37.620
bacon crumbles bacon crumbles, of course

55:38.580 --> 55:40.580
sour cream

55:41.420 --> 55:48.420
That's marshmallow cream on top of a vanilla sugar cookie base topped with salty potato chips savory bacon crumbles and Subway's brand-new

55:48.940 --> 55:50.380
dill pickles

55:50.380 --> 55:58.360
Lordy Lou bringing together two of Subway's most iconic menu items footlong subs and Subway cookies was the only way

55:59.140 --> 56:05.240
We could top our celebration of National Cookie Day from last year when we opened the first cookie way says Paul

56:05.620 --> 56:07.420
Who works at Subway?

56:07.420 --> 56:14.800
We wanted to give Subway fans even more cookie to love with flavors and ingredients that are just as craveable as the sandwiches

56:14.800 --> 56:16.140
They're inspired

56:16.140 --> 56:23.540
Do you think these are just as they may be just as craveable as a place that that when people said?

56:23.540 --> 56:26.820
That's not tuna all of America said. Yeah, that sounds right

56:29.620 --> 56:35.260
Tracks three out of four of these have things jammed on top as

56:35.620 --> 56:40.860
Though a Subway City Council decided they were sick of people taking naps on these

56:41.660 --> 56:43.660
Yeah

56:43.660 --> 56:46.740
These are brutalist pigeons. Oh, yeah

56:46.740 --> 56:52.020
This is these look like they're designed to challenge you to try to figure out how to eat them

56:52.020 --> 56:54.940
I find within myself a boiling anger

56:56.340 --> 57:00.820
Witnessing these we can't feed everybody in this country, but we're gonna do this

57:00.820 --> 57:03.940
We'll just have these benches these edible benches

57:03.940 --> 57:09.480
These look like if all six of our children were let loose in a Subway cookie

57:09.480 --> 57:14.480
Factory and given complete reign to do whatever the fuck they wanted. Yeah, and they started on cookie

57:14.480 --> 57:17.720
Number one looking for a cookie they'd eat and by cookie number four

57:17.720 --> 57:20.920
They were like, we're gonna force our parents to eat these that it'll be funny as shit

57:23.960 --> 57:30.040
Like the thing you would dare little Greg to eat at the lunch table for $5 that five of your friends pulled

57:30.120 --> 57:32.840
$1 in to get him to eat this mess
