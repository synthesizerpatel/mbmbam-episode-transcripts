00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:50.880
Father's Day, Anthony Weiner. We tried to come up with a way to combine those two openings

00:51.520 --> 00:57.840
for 30 minutes. Solid. Nothing. He's a daddy, right? Instead, we'll just say Anthony Weiner,

00:57.840 --> 01:03.600
Father's Day. My brother, my brother, and me. Sorry to begin in such an upsetting fact.

01:04.720 --> 01:13.520
Topical, cutting edge, Weiner, Weiner, Weiner. Lots of comedians are making Weiner puns,

01:13.520 --> 01:17.200
but nobody's really embracing just saying Weiner Day.

01:17.840 --> 01:22.560
I've fallen behind on the news. What's this guy's story? What's his sitch?

01:22.560 --> 01:29.360
His story is he is a lawmaker with a really great sense of irony.

01:29.360 --> 01:34.320
Yeah, and a really great iron, a really great nine iron down there in his zone, he means,

01:34.320 --> 01:37.440
I mean, in his pants. In his Caddyshack?

01:37.440 --> 01:39.280
It is down in his Caddyshack.

01:39.280 --> 01:45.200
Representative Weiner represented his Weiner to a lady on Twitter.

01:45.200 --> 01:53.680
But it doesn't matter because the comedic ground has already been thoroughly sort of tilled.

01:53.680 --> 01:59.440
What I'm saying is nobody's pushed it the extra level of blending with Father's Day.

01:59.440 --> 02:00.000
I see.

02:00.000 --> 02:04.320
Right, right. I think it's going to give it that special picante spice that we regularly

02:04.320 --> 02:06.160
provide with our topical mashups.

02:06.160 --> 02:07.520
Is that cilantro? No.

02:08.720 --> 02:13.120
So hold up, hold up. This cat, he tweeted a dick pic?

02:13.120 --> 02:15.200
I can't, like, keep you...

02:15.200 --> 02:21.040
No, no, no, hold on. This is a chance for real world wisdom.

02:21.040 --> 02:25.600
Like, unless you've got a sound effect somewhere of like a hyperbaric chamber opening and you're

02:25.600 --> 02:26.400
stepping out of it.

02:27.360 --> 02:32.880
No, seriously. So he didn't text it. He tweet blasted his dick to a woman?

02:32.880 --> 02:33.680
Yes.

02:33.680 --> 02:35.200
How do you goof that hard?

02:35.200 --> 02:41.760
You forget that D to signify a direct message and says just like, hey, Lloyd, look what I did.

02:41.760 --> 02:43.520
Check out this dick and these balls.

02:43.520 --> 02:45.200
Look what God did, Lori.

02:45.200 --> 02:47.920
Oh, God, that's rough. That's rough stuff.

02:47.920 --> 02:52.080
That's rough, but it's been rough for like two weeks. Like, what are you? What have you been?

02:52.880 --> 02:57.040
Like, it's been like the biggest because Wiener is his name. Like, his name is Wiener and like...

02:57.040 --> 03:02.080
Justin, I had to go on a spiritual spirit quest journey.

03:02.080 --> 03:05.440
Unless your ass is in a sweat lodge. I have no excuses.

03:05.440 --> 03:11.600
In the week before and after, I went to a coffee enema lodge to prepare for the live

03:11.600 --> 03:12.400
show that we did.

03:12.400 --> 03:14.400
Isn't that right across from King's Island?

03:14.400 --> 03:21.040
It is. You turn left to King's Island. It's actually on top of the fake Eiffel Tower in

03:21.040 --> 03:24.800
King's Island. You get up there and you just for two weeks, just like find your spirit

03:24.800 --> 03:27.040
animal and get coffee enemas back to back.

03:27.040 --> 03:29.840
That's how it sounds beautiful. This is, as you certainly guessed,

03:29.840 --> 03:33.600
my brother and my brother and me, an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother,

03:33.600 --> 03:34.880
Justin McElroy.

03:34.880 --> 03:37.280
And I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

03:37.280 --> 03:42.240
And I'm the baby Griffin. How do you tweet a picture of your dick at somebody?

03:42.240 --> 03:46.080
And then as an elected official, how do you do that and then not go,

03:46.080 --> 03:48.160
Oh, damn shit.

03:48.160 --> 03:51.360
Well, that's the coolest thing about this story. I cannot believe you've drugged me

03:51.360 --> 03:57.280
into talking about this. The best thing about this story is that when everybody was like,

03:57.280 --> 04:01.280
Hey, you tweeted a picture of your dick. He was like, hackers.

04:01.280 --> 04:10.240
Fucking lulz, lulz set kicked in my door, pulled down my pants and snapped a JPEG on

04:10.240 --> 04:10.960
my sweet dick.

04:10.960 --> 04:15.440
It's literally like, I could not kick that dick out of a lineup.

04:15.440 --> 04:18.080
Shaggy was directly behind him like, say it wasn't you.

04:21.120 --> 04:24.160
You got me, Shaggy. Are you sure, Shaggy? Say it wasn't you.

04:25.440 --> 04:28.880
And that'll work. Just tell him it wasn't. Say it wasn't. All right.

04:28.880 --> 04:29.840
You get it, Shag.

04:29.840 --> 04:34.640
Um, picture this. I tweeted a picture of my dick.

04:34.640 --> 04:35.140
Shaggy!

04:36.240 --> 04:40.080
So this is our advice show. Let's get to the advice.

04:40.800 --> 04:45.920
This girl I've been dating for two and a half months now. We have S-E-X on a regular basis.

04:46.960 --> 04:52.320
I come over to her apartment often and we even go on dates every week.

04:52.320 --> 04:55.040
Despite all this, she doesn't want to be called my girlfriend.

04:55.040 --> 04:59.440
And when I asked her what it is that we're doing, she says, hanging out.

05:00.800 --> 05:05.280
When I ask her what she tells her family about me, she says, I'm the guy.

05:06.000 --> 05:10.080
What do I do, brothers? Sincerely, Lost in Translation.

05:10.960 --> 05:15.360
Just first and foremost, I think being called the guy is way cooler than being the boyfriend.

05:15.360 --> 05:17.120
Yeah, it's pretty fucking cool.

05:17.120 --> 05:21.840
Like, oh, this is my roofing. This is my roofing guy. This is my fucking guy.

05:21.840 --> 05:24.240
This is my guy for doing it.

05:24.960 --> 05:30.000
Um, yeah, like that that sounds like like calling somebody the guy is like something

05:30.000 --> 05:33.600
you reserve for super like that's something you'd call Timothy Olyphant or something.

05:34.960 --> 05:36.720
Like super cool people.

05:36.720 --> 05:37.220
Uh huh.

05:38.480 --> 05:41.520
Um, you don't get much cooler than Timothy Olyphant.

05:41.520 --> 05:48.800
Timmy O, um, I, I think that you're, you are a little too hung up on nomenclature and she's

05:48.800 --> 05:52.400
way too hung up on avoiding nomenclature, like to a weird extent.

05:53.120 --> 05:56.640
Like, you know, but I, I know those people. I know those people that say like putting

05:56.640 --> 06:02.080
a name on it ruins it, but they're still doing that. They're still dating. They're still doing

06:02.080 --> 06:05.920
the shit, but they're just not calling it that cause they're afraid of spoiling it or ruining

06:05.920 --> 06:11.600
it or something. And that's dumb. But at the same time, it's straightforward dumb. It's like,

06:11.600 --> 06:13.840
Hey, here's the deal. We're not going to call it boyfriend, girlfriend.

06:13.840 --> 06:19.040
Listen, a rose, a rose by any other name is still getting a stick wet on the rag.

06:19.040 --> 06:24.080
What's up? Yeah. You, you, I mean, if, if you're uncomfortable now, okay,

06:24.080 --> 06:29.280
maybe it's not the labels. Maybe it's the lack of stability. I would say that he's unsure.

06:29.280 --> 06:32.800
Like it's, you know, he doesn't know what they're doing, right? He doesn't know.

06:33.840 --> 06:38.240
It's not just that she is, you know what I think that I think that that happens in every

06:38.240 --> 06:42.720
relationship and it's not just with the title. I think that yeah, the title is this security

06:42.720 --> 06:46.880
blanket that makes you feel better. But I think everybody always goes through that entrance period,

06:46.880 --> 06:51.520
especially two and a half months in, geez. I just like, what is this? What's going on?

06:52.240 --> 06:58.720
Are we committed? I don't know. Am I the guy? Yeah. I can't carry the guy.

06:58.720 --> 07:04.400
I can't think of a, like a relationship status that is more secure than hanging out

07:06.160 --> 07:12.160
because you can't, you'll never stop hanging out. Like you can take that shit to the grave.

07:12.160 --> 07:20.480
Like, Oh, do you, Lori promise to take Jacob and just like fucking bro out within 24.

07:20.480 --> 07:26.800
Sev, I, uh, speaking of labels, I have hung out many a time. You are not hanging out. No.

07:26.800 --> 07:33.840
I mean, in between, in between playing Sega and eating juice pops. Yeah. Hey, you want to pop in

07:33.840 --> 07:38.880
an inch on 96 little fuck, whatever, whatever you want to do. Just come over and hang out.

07:38.880 --> 07:45.600
We'll make some bagel bites. See where it goes. Just grow out with some NES. Um, I, I think that

07:45.600 --> 07:53.120
if it, you can ask her to label things all you want. She's obviously not ready for anything

07:53.120 --> 07:57.600
super serious. So I, I, if you're expecting that or wanting that, I don't think you're going to

07:57.600 --> 08:03.360
get it from this girl. Nope. At least not right now. Not directly, but I mean, well, it depends on

08:03.360 --> 08:10.480
when you could turn it into a relationship without labeling it, without making it a big deal,

08:10.480 --> 08:14.800
it can become a relationship. But if it's important to you that you know what it is upfront,

08:15.520 --> 08:22.640
you're not going to get that. Let's ask her, am I a guy or the guy? As long as you're the guy are

08:22.640 --> 08:30.800
cool. Unless he's like got the man. Unless you're the guy, number 26, the dude, the fella, the

08:30.800 --> 08:39.120
gentleman suitor. This is my caller. He's taking me to cotillion. He brought me a glassy unicorn.

08:43.440 --> 08:50.800
Way too much. Twin Peaks. Yeah. I have what? No. What? I'm going to come through this fucking

08:50.800 --> 08:58.960
microphone. Clarence Menagerie you dumb bitch. There's also in Twin Peaks a scene where the

08:58.960 --> 09:03.520
guy gives the other girl it's the glass unicorn. God, you're right. All right. Damn it. I'll let

09:03.520 --> 09:15.200
it slide this time. Deez Nuts. Agent Dale Cooper up in this bitch. All right. I have an etiquette

09:15.200 --> 09:19.840
question for you. Oh, you've come to the right place clearly. Often when a friend or family

09:19.840 --> 09:22.720
member is going through a difficult time, a person will say something along the lines of,

09:22.720 --> 09:30.080
I'll be praying for you. You'll be in my prayers. This thing is I'm not a particularly religious

09:30.080 --> 09:34.160
person, so telling someone I'm going to pray for them feels a little fraudulent. Obviously,

09:35.360 --> 09:39.600
if someone is about to go into surgery or something, it's not a good time to say good luck

09:39.600 --> 09:45.760
with all that or that death is probabilistic and ultimately inevitable. So can you guys help me

09:45.760 --> 09:51.360
come up with some other non-religious phrases that carry the same weight and meaning as

09:51.360 --> 09:59.440
Deez more traditional sentiments? Thanks for the help, Chris. Wow. Wow. Well, don't definitely

09:59.440 --> 10:04.880
don't say that shit about death being inevitable. I think that there is I think that there's such

10:04.880 --> 10:10.480
a wide spectrum between I'll be praying for you and good luck with all that. Yeah. You know what?

10:10.480 --> 10:15.200
I know there's some shit in between those two, right, dawg? I tell people they've been on my

10:15.200 --> 10:19.680
heart. Yeah, it seems that cuts that cuts to, hey, you've been on my heart lately. You've you've been

10:19.680 --> 10:25.200
you've been in my thoughts. Yeah, there it is. Been in my heart. My thoughts. My whole thing

10:25.200 --> 10:30.000
has been about you. You could also say I'll be playing for you if you're a professional athlete

10:30.000 --> 10:35.920
because then it's like, oh, they're dedicating or a musician or if you have a like a particularly

10:35.920 --> 10:41.040
intense like bocce ball match coming up. Yeah, this one's for you, Greg. That's what I'm going

10:41.040 --> 10:48.000
to do with this bowl. I don't know. I think you can also say, like, you know, I'm here. I'm here.

10:48.000 --> 10:51.520
If you need anything, let me know if you need anything and I can help you with that. Like,

10:51.520 --> 10:56.960
I think that I think that saying that you'll be in my thoughts, it's not practical. What's

10:56.960 --> 11:02.480
bad about like if something happens, I'll marry your wife. No, no, no. Like, do you do you want

11:02.480 --> 11:08.320
any? I'm about to run a Taco Bell. Do you want a fajita and maybe a medium Baja blast? There's

11:08.320 --> 11:13.120
maybe some cinnamon twists. You want to get surgery? Dangerous, dangerous surgery. But do

11:13.120 --> 11:17.760
you want a chalupa first? What a surprise. That'll be for the doctor. What's this? What's this in

11:17.760 --> 11:25.120
side him? Hey, is this a Baja fish taco that you ate before surgery? You were given explicit

11:25.120 --> 11:31.440
instructions not to eat and specific instructions not to eat Baja fish tacos ever. Why would you

11:31.440 --> 11:37.440
put two in here? Are these your car keys? What did you even do? Wait a second. Wait a second.

11:37.440 --> 11:49.760
The tumor is gone. Fish taco killed your tumor. This is Baja sauce is a cure. Eureka. Eureka.

11:51.520 --> 12:00.640
Thank you, you fat fuck. You did it. So what what other? How about if something happens,

12:00.640 --> 12:04.960
I'll delete your internet history. It's good. I feel like that's practical. I'd appreciate it.

12:04.960 --> 12:15.120
Yeah. Um, how about you are definitely going to make it through this. Guarantee them. I swear

12:15.120 --> 12:20.000
on every by the moon and the stars in the sky. Oh, the best part about that is if something happens,

12:20.000 --> 12:24.080
how are you going to be held accountable? That's true. That's true. They got, well,

12:24.080 --> 12:29.120
you got hauntings. Yeah. OBS, obviously. Oh, you're going to have a ghost writer situation

12:29.120 --> 12:33.200
on your hands. Yeah. He's going to haunt your words, your phrases, read everything you're

12:33.200 --> 12:38.560
writing. Going to make your words better. Talk about your grammar. Yeah. Or your grandma. Hey,

12:38.560 --> 12:43.280
Griffin, you know, do you want to Yahoo? Yeah. I haven't looked at these for a while. I should

12:43.280 --> 12:49.760
probably really having to suck at this thermos to get the coffee inside. So if you hear like a

12:49.760 --> 12:55.120
sort of like a, a wet wind tunnel, like a squishy wind tunnel, that's me getting some hazelnut.

12:56.640 --> 13:02.800
This one was the daily dosage of vitamin H. This one was sent by two people, hazelnut,

13:02.800 --> 13:08.080
which is weird. Came from two different people with the same question. The internet's such a

13:08.080 --> 13:14.880
big place. Yeah. It was sent by Thomas Anderson and Jonathan Cole. Thank you, dudes. It's by

13:14.880 --> 13:22.880
Yahoo Answers user Lucretia Millicent, who asks, my 14 year old sister is afraid of Hitler. I

13:22.880 --> 13:29.200
thought she was crazy, but now I'm starting to wonder. My little sister is so scared to death

13:29.200 --> 13:34.320
of Hitler. She can't even go outside. It started when she had this dream about Hitler coming up

13:34.320 --> 13:38.800
through the plumbing and getting in the house. So she makes us keep cement blocks on all the

13:38.800 --> 13:44.720
toilet lids and also on the washer. And she will only take baths, no showers so she can plug the

13:44.720 --> 13:49.200
hole. She says Hitler can come out of the sewer though. And that's why she refuses to leave the

13:49.200 --> 13:55.680
house. Now I was really worried and wanted to help her get over it. So I made up a spell to banish

13:55.680 --> 14:00.800
Hitler, thinking that maybe that would make her feel safe. Well, we were doing the spell in the

14:00.800 --> 14:06.320
bathroom and the toilet seat lifted. And I heard some man speaking German. We screamed and got up

14:06.320 --> 14:10.720
and ran off. And now my sister's putting chains on the toilet. So I hope no one gets the shits

14:10.720 --> 14:17.360
anytime soon. What happened? That's what I'm wondering. That's my favorite part of this

14:17.360 --> 14:24.000
question. Can't quite put it together. So Hitler. Okay. If you believe in Hitler hard enough, he

14:24.000 --> 14:29.280
will appear. That's that's an inevitability. We've actually said his name too many times now.

14:29.280 --> 14:34.880
Cause if you say it to me enough times, he just, he apparates like Betelgeuse, very much like

14:34.880 --> 14:42.320
Betelgeuse only instead of a mischief, he, he, he does unspeakable genocide crimes. Well, I think

14:42.320 --> 14:47.680
that, um, I remember from spectrum, right? It's like the worst, the worst kind of, it's like the

14:47.680 --> 14:55.200
most mischief you could do ever. Like the highest level of shenanigans ever to the point. I can't,

14:55.200 --> 15:03.440
I don't think we can call it hijinks. Like it's like a nightmarish crime against humanity indicates

15:03.440 --> 15:09.680
like a wink and a nod. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Hijinks usually is harmless. It's like a fiasco. I would

15:09.680 --> 15:15.200
not, I would not call the planking is hijinks. Yes. Thank you. Have you guys ever heard that

15:15.200 --> 15:22.160
urban legend, um, where parents buy their kids, um, baby hitlers and then as they start to get

15:22.160 --> 15:27.600
too big, the parents flush the baby hitlers down the toilet and then you have to worry about the

15:27.600 --> 15:32.880
deal grown hitlers down in the sewer. Right. And it forms if, if, if they get to, um, in like a

15:32.880 --> 15:38.080
metropolitan area, this is true. I swear to Christ, uh, in, in metropolitan areas where the population,

15:38.080 --> 15:44.160
uh, per mile is, is, you know, so dense that the, uh, the hitlers, the flushed hitlers will grow

15:44.160 --> 15:48.720
together and form a Hitler king. That's absolutely true. That is a hundred percent. Absolutely true.

15:48.720 --> 15:53.120
That is a hundred percent true. The only thing that you can hope is that Winston Churchill

15:53.120 --> 15:57.920
has also been flushed and has been baked in some sort of mutagenic ooze. And then they have the

15:57.920 --> 16:06.880
most epic battle, the most epic battle. Um, somebody like, can we go ahead and option these rights?

16:06.880 --> 16:14.640
TM by the way. TM all that shit. C with a circle around it. Ninja Winston's teenager.

16:17.120 --> 16:19.120
I'm Winston. I'm also Winston.

16:22.400 --> 16:25.840
I use the bo staff. I use the bo staff, but I am Winston.

16:27.120 --> 16:32.400
Do you know what, uh, Hitler and also Hitler King's biggest weaknesses?

16:32.400 --> 16:35.280
Lemon juice. Magic spells.

16:35.920 --> 16:40.000
Magic spells, obviously. That's why he got so fucking aggro and tried to come out of your

16:40.000 --> 16:44.480
toilet pipes is because you, you pissed him off with your magic spells. Most people don't know

16:44.480 --> 16:51.440
this. Um, Hitler hauntings, you can, you can comfortably live in, in a place, in an apartment

16:51.440 --> 16:56.320
or home, uh, any sort of domestic setting that is being haunted by a Hitler ghost.

16:57.120 --> 17:00.640
Usually, usually you can make it work for you and see if the land will, will, you know,

17:00.640 --> 17:07.280
knock off a hundo from that wreck. Hey, I'm pretty sure it smells like mustache wax in here. I pretty

17:07.280 --> 17:15.520
much all the time. Yeah. What can I do? What can you do? Um, also what happened? People say, what

17:15.520 --> 17:21.360
happened to Hitler? You mean, or the mustache? This whole situation. I'm so confused. What

17:21.360 --> 17:27.200
happened with their spell? Like, I don't know. Was a Ouija board involved? Was there a Ouija?

17:27.200 --> 17:31.760
Cause I read a book, a tract, actually a Chick tract about Ouija boards and they're, they are

17:31.760 --> 17:35.920
evil. I know that much. Yeah, definitely. When you were talking about the part where like, she's

17:35.920 --> 17:41.520
afraid to go outside. I had this mental image of like the girl looking out the window and Hitler

17:41.520 --> 17:45.200
leaning out from behind a tree and just like pointing at the girl and the girl was ducking

17:45.200 --> 17:49.520
back down. Now I'm scared of Hitler. Thanks so much. That's a horror time. Can't leave the

17:49.520 --> 17:55.600
house now. My longtime boyfriend followed me when I moved out of state and it did not go well.

17:55.600 --> 18:00.640
We broke up and he moved back to our hometown. However, he left most of his personal belongings

18:00.640 --> 18:06.000
behind. Keep saying he's going to get them, but it's been almost a year since he moved out. Now

18:06.000 --> 18:12.560
my lease is up at the end of summer and I want to move to a new apartment. Is it okay for me to

18:12.560 --> 18:17.840
throw his stuff away? That was from Carrie Anne. Yes, of course it is. Of course it is. How's this

18:17.840 --> 18:24.160
a question? Hey, throw everything away. I'm, I'm moving to, um, to Austin in a little under a month

18:24.160 --> 18:30.000
now and I'm going to throw, watch out ladies. Hey babies. I'm going to throw every fucking thing

18:30.000 --> 18:35.600
that I own away that I don't use on a day to day. If there were other people that you took with you.

18:35.600 --> 18:41.600
Oh man, it's gone man. It's fucking gone. If you have shit in my employee that I have not touched

18:41.600 --> 18:47.520
nor seen in, in 12 months, it's gone. It's gone. So I think Carrie, an important thing to keep in

18:47.520 --> 18:53.360
mind here is when he left that shit there, here's basically saying to you, Hey, make sure you move

18:53.360 --> 18:58.080
this with you when you go anywhere. And that's bullshit. It doesn't come to get it in a year or

18:58.080 --> 19:02.400
asked you to ship it to them or pay for shipping or something. It's yours. You need to sell it in

19:02.400 --> 19:09.200
a garage sale or give it away or burn it. Nobody wants things anymore. I think that since I turned,

19:09.840 --> 19:15.920
uh, call it 18, the, my main action has been getting rid of stuff, like trying to unload stuff

19:15.920 --> 19:21.360
and my getting rid of material possessions in this world, you accumulate them so quickly. I just want

19:21.360 --> 19:27.360
to get rid of them. I just hate shit. I want to get rid of shit. Yeah. I hate having things and I,

19:27.360 --> 19:32.160
I try to get rid of them. I try to pawn them off on, uh, people that come into my office.

19:32.160 --> 19:39.360
I'll hand them several books or maybe, uh, uh, old fifth grade drawings, some masking tape.

19:39.360 --> 19:45.280
That's almost all gone. I don't want to keep the roll around. Like he just pawned all that off on

19:45.280 --> 19:50.320
you. I think you probably want to shoot him a text. Just like, Hey, your stuff's going in the

19:50.320 --> 19:56.800
garbage. Sorry, Dylan. Come get it. Come get it. If you want it to the garbage dumpster,

19:56.800 --> 20:00.960
probably bullshit stuff anyways. I mean, if he didn't take it with him, he can't be that committed.

20:00.960 --> 20:05.360
Yeah. It's not like his fucking asthma inhalers that he needs to live. Like it's his fucking

20:05.360 --> 20:12.560
rollout desk. Like it's, it's probably got all got bed bugs in it. Yeah. You know what else is

20:12.560 --> 20:20.720
in that stuff? Memories. Gotta get rid of it, girl. It's all, he left you with a bunch of bed bug

20:20.720 --> 20:25.840
stuff, a bunch of BB gear and you're supposed to keep it? Nah, it's going to the dumpster.

20:27.040 --> 20:33.600
Sorry, BB gear. Sorry, Dylan. Your things are in the trash. I set them on fire. Also, I miss you.

20:33.600 --> 20:38.480
Come back. Dylan, I miss you so much. Please come back. How can I become cooler on Facebook?

20:38.480 --> 20:42.800
I try to post interesting status updates, upload wacky photos of my friends and I,

20:42.800 --> 20:46.320
and I often wish other people happy birthday, even if I don't know them that well. But no one

20:46.320 --> 20:50.000
ever gives me any Facebook attention. I want to be cool in the internet world,

20:50.000 --> 20:55.120
as well as the regular world. Help me, brothers. What should I do? Pitiful in Pittsburgh.

20:55.680 --> 21:01.520
That's no way to start. Yeah. Don't be pitiful. Trying to buck up. Trying to turn this around.

21:01.520 --> 21:09.200
Do less? Yeah, that's it. No, you got to make them want it. Yeah. You think? How can they miss you

21:09.200 --> 21:15.680
if you're always there? It's like this. If you, if you accept every friend request and say yes to

21:15.680 --> 21:19.760
everybody who asks you to do something, then it's not special. But if you request like, if you

21:20.480 --> 21:25.280
accept like one out of every thousand, then that one person feels so fucking special to be your

21:25.280 --> 21:29.920
friend. How would they ever know though? How could you ever know? I'll tell them. I'll tell you what

21:29.920 --> 21:34.800
discourages me from, from interacting with people on Facebook. You got to get a good picture of

21:34.800 --> 21:40.880
yourself. Don't put a weird picture of you standing in shadows that looks like you're on fire. Oh,

21:40.880 --> 21:46.320
you smell bad and there's PU lines going off. Get like, get your sexy right. Get a really nice

21:46.320 --> 21:52.080
looking picture. You know what I mean? Who are these people that have photoshopped stink flies

21:52.720 --> 21:57.520
and PU lines coming off their body? Somebody who would call themselves pitiful in Pittsburgh.

21:57.520 --> 22:03.840
Fair enough. Make sure that you don't have a Facebook photo of like an animal or like you

22:03.840 --> 22:10.080
in a big group. Oh, I hate that. Are you and a baby and the babies in the picture? That's not

22:10.080 --> 22:13.200
a baby. When it's not your baby because it confuses all of your friends from high school.

22:13.760 --> 22:16.640
They're all going, oh, is that your baby? And you're like, no. It's like, well,

22:16.640 --> 22:21.280
bullshit. Thanks for putting the baby on the grid, asshole. My latest point of contention

22:21.280 --> 22:25.760
is for Father's Day, a lot of people have been changing their Facebook profile pictures to that

22:25.760 --> 22:30.640
of their dads of their daddies. And it's like, that's pretty confusing for me when it's like,

22:30.640 --> 22:35.680
oh, Jennifer kind of looks like a dad now. Like why am I friends with all these old dads? Why?

22:35.680 --> 22:40.960
Why are all these dads? My friend, my ex girlfriend is a dad. What things? I got,

22:40.960 --> 22:48.720
I got off that train just in time. Apparently for the swap, the switcheroo. Um, also I would suggest

22:48.720 --> 22:53.600
not wishing happy birthday to people. You don't know that well. I wouldn't want people. I don't

22:53.600 --> 22:57.120
know that well. The wish me happy birthday kind of creeps me out that they know that much about me.

22:58.000 --> 23:03.360
I don't know about that. I like, I mean, we've talked about my, um, my policy on Facebook and

23:03.360 --> 23:09.120
how it's basically just a bed of human beings that I just roll around and get dirty. Okay.

23:09.120 --> 23:16.240
Their thoughts just like, Hey, weirdo don't know you. Here's a poke. Is it possible that you,

23:17.360 --> 23:22.560
uh, that you posted a lot of bullshit? Cause sometimes when people post a lot of bullshit,

23:22.560 --> 23:28.000
I just give me old blocker Reno. I send them straight to the block pile and it could be

23:28.560 --> 23:37.040
that you've gotten the old, the old block. I don't have a better name for it, but like,

23:38.160 --> 23:42.000
it could be that you just got blocked and like nobody can see your shit because forever you

23:42.000 --> 23:46.560
talked about how depressed you were and no one wants to see that. That's the first thing. If

23:46.560 --> 23:50.080
you're doing that, which if your name is pitiful and Pittsburgh, I'm assuming you've done at least

23:50.080 --> 23:56.240
once. Like fuck that noise. Like you got to who people want to be friends with happy people.

23:57.280 --> 24:01.360
Like I like to hang out with happy people. Those are the people I want to associate with.

24:01.360 --> 24:08.560
So just fake it. Put on a big plastic smile. Have you thought about, um, Facebooking pictures of

24:08.560 --> 24:14.080
your, of your, of your PP, of your cleaner, of your weakness of your weakness? Have you

24:14.080 --> 24:18.720
thought about Facebooking like wildfire and then with a caption that says, wish you were here

24:18.720 --> 24:24.880
or in my wiener. What I'm going to just tag your tag, your whole wiener. I guess that's what people

24:24.880 --> 24:32.320
do with photos and see if anybody like likes it. Do you like this wiener? Like 65 people like this

24:46.480 --> 24:53.120
edge. Change your face, change your relationship status to dead to dead. I'll get some attention.

24:53.120 --> 25:00.000
No, don't do that. Cause then you, you would be killed. Um, I think that first off you need

25:00.000 --> 25:04.480
to private message everybody and say, I'm sorry that I was so depressing for so long, but I'm

25:04.480 --> 25:10.240

Tag these. How about a yahoo? A yahoo? Was that not a yahoo? No. Wow. Okay. I know. Um,

26:08.720 --> 26:13.280
this one was sent in by Ousmane Mariko. I'm a Bim Bam superfan. Thank you Ousmane. We're

26:13.280 --> 26:17.760
getting there closer. It's by yahoo answers user Rebecca Rose who asks,

26:19.200 --> 26:24.640
what would you consider to be personality traits of an ideal stallion?

26:24.640 --> 26:31.760
Hmm. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Go on. No, I won't go on. Cause that's all that this question is.

26:32.320 --> 26:37.680
Like literal stallion. Yeah. Like a, like a, like a horse, like a proud.

26:37.680 --> 26:43.520
Well, I think we can all agree unbroken spirit. Unbroken spirit. Unbroken legs also is important.

26:44.720 --> 26:46.880
Less of a personality. I think discreet.

26:49.360 --> 26:52.240
Able to keep a secret. What is the application of that?

26:52.240 --> 26:55.600
What, what, what, why do we need to discreet? Well, Griffin, if I knew the application,

26:55.600 --> 26:59.440
I wouldn't, I wouldn't tell you. I mean, I'm trying to be like a stallion here.

26:59.440 --> 27:03.200
It defeats the point of discretion if you just go and your wiener pics everywhere.

27:04.720 --> 27:11.600
Hey horse, why did you tweet this picture of my wiener? Hey horse, I didn't give you my phone.

27:12.320 --> 27:15.600
That was between us. That was between us, horse.

27:15.600 --> 27:22.400
I came to you in confidence. What kind of smartphone could a horse possibly operate?

27:22.960 --> 27:26.960
This question is ridiculous. So there's another good personality trait. Dexterity.

27:26.960 --> 27:34.160
Dexterity. Like yeah. Manual dexterity. Um, tail. A smooth tail. A proud tail.

27:35.280 --> 27:41.040
That's important in races. Um. And also not a racist. I don't like a horse.

27:41.040 --> 27:46.320
I, I want them to love all horses and humans equally. Open-minded. Yeah. It's okay if they're

27:46.320 --> 27:50.400
biasing against fat people because that's like a health issue. Yeah. Yeah, they'll snap right in

27:50.400 --> 27:57.680
half. Um, I think, I think you gotta, it's gotta have some wisdom in its eyes. That's good. I think

27:57.680 --> 28:03.280
when you look deep in that horse's eyes, you've gotta know that there's, there's, there's feelings

28:03.280 --> 28:08.160
stirring around in there, you know? And no bugs. No bugs. I hate it when a horse has bugs in there

28:08.160 --> 28:13.840
and it won't even use its comically long tongue to lick them off or sweep the way with its mane,

28:13.840 --> 28:20.160
with a flourish of its proud long head. Um, have you mentioned? I just love horses so much.

28:20.960 --> 28:27.600
I love horses too. I love their thick trunks. And I think that I need a proud horse. I think I need

28:27.600 --> 28:33.920
a proud, um, gelding. I want to, I want a horse that's going to be more like a best friend. Yeah.

28:33.920 --> 28:40.320
Yeah. Yeah. Right. And maybe we go on adventures together and like my cowboy hat falls off and he

28:40.320 --> 28:44.560
picks it up for me and nudges me forward and drives me on. That's so great. I just want,

28:44.560 --> 28:49.760
I want a horse I can hang out with in every possible definition of the term. Yeah. Just

28:49.760 --> 28:53.920
a horse who's fucking cool. I just want, not uppity like some of those other horses. I just

28:53.920 --> 28:59.360
want to hang out. I want a horse that if I joke like maybe today you can ride me,

28:59.360 --> 29:05.680
me, he'll, he'll laugh, but he won't take the joke too far. Yeah. Very painful. They're very heavy.

29:05.680 --> 29:11.200
I've, I've written a lot of Pintos that will just like take the goof and run with it. And it's like,

29:11.200 --> 29:16.000
now it's weird Pinto and I have to put you down. Now I have to destroy you. Cause I know you're

29:16.000 --> 29:21.040
not discreet. I was trying to forgive that. But now I want a horse that knows that when I have to

29:21.040 --> 29:27.520
destroy him, I have to do it. Sure. Like he's, he's, he feels bad for you because of the position

29:27.520 --> 29:32.240
that he is putting you in with his broke ass legs. He knows it's going to hurt me more than it's

29:32.240 --> 29:39.200
going to hurt him. Yeah. I want, yeah. And I want him to make it easier on me by hurling some really

29:39.200 --> 29:44.000
hateful shit. Yeah. Like hateful shit about my parents and loved ones. Oh, like I bet you won't

29:44.000 --> 29:50.960
do it. You coward. You coward. We are, we're putting the horse before the cart. Uh, if you've

29:50.960 --> 29:57.920
got to, you got to put the horse before the cart, shut your fucking mouth. You got to have,

29:57.920 --> 30:03.040
that's the kind of talk that'll get a horse shot. He has got to be able to talk. He has to possess.

30:05.280 --> 30:12.560
Yeah. Um, which is what's the point, which is rare. Um, I think mayor, but worth worth a couple

30:12.560 --> 30:18.320
extra bucks. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'll drop an extra. Um, Oh, that's a big, he has to be cheap.

30:18.320 --> 30:22.720
You guys did not cost a lot of money. So we need a cheap talking horse that's able to use a

30:22.720 --> 30:28.000
smartphone with a lot of my cowboy hat with tenderness. Just discretion for miles. That

30:28.000 --> 30:33.600
should be his name. Discretion for miles. Discretion for miles. I want one that doesn't

30:33.600 --> 30:39.520
make you kill it to get the glue out of him. Yeah. Give him your glue you stingy bastard.

30:40.720 --> 30:46.880
You want to be able to lactate his glue gland for a quick patch job. Um,

30:46.880 --> 30:53.200
okay. I think that your horse feet, is it too much to ask for a winning smile?

30:54.160 --> 31:01.280
No, a winning smile. I couldn't, I couldn't understand you. I would like my horse to enjoy

31:01.280 --> 31:08.640
eating apples. Can we make that happen? And oats. Yes. Don't mistake my fingers for carrots.

31:08.640 --> 31:14.320
I'm just giving you this carrot. Um, an apologetic course for when he does nibble

31:14.320 --> 31:23.200
your fingers. Rainbows behind him leaves rainbows. I want a horse with a horn. Okay. Okay. That is a

31:24.240 --> 31:29.600
unicorn, but no, cause it doesn't have to be on his head. It could be, it could also be a deer.

31:29.600 --> 31:35.760
Um, like a buck is a buck is basically a horse with a horn. What about a horse with like mini horns

31:35.760 --> 31:41.840
that makes it like a spiny exoskeleton. Ah, and maybe fire shoots out of his nose. Yeah. Okay.

31:41.840 --> 31:48.800
Yeah. Yeah. Can I, and he can fly. Uh, and also he's got a big saddle on it. You can ride on him.

31:48.800 --> 31:54.160
And he's got like a tank gun. Yeah. He's got a tank gun for a mouth. He's got like howitzer treads

31:54.160 --> 31:59.840
on his legs. Yeah. Yeah. And he can fucking like fly through space and shit. Yeah. And he's,

31:59.840 --> 32:06.800
he can shoot, he can shoot blood out of him. So fucking discreet. Just discreet as shit. He'll

32:06.800 --> 32:12.720
never tell anyone about any of this. I want to ride. Oh, maybe he looks like a regular horse by

32:12.720 --> 32:18.080
day and then an awesome space tank spiny leaf by night. Like a he-man. Transformer horse. Yes. Yes.

32:19.760 --> 32:30.320
I'm a tank. I'm a horse. Come here, Shia. Shia, come here. Grab my mane. Feed me oats.

32:30.320 --> 32:34.960
I'm gonna shoot blood out of my face. I'm eight feet tall. I'm a big robot horse. Does it look

32:34.960 --> 32:40.560
like a robot horse or does it look like a regular horse that transforms flawlessly into sort of a

32:40.560 --> 32:47.760
fleshy, mane-y. And sprays blood everywhere in the process. And it's killed. That's so important.

32:47.760 --> 32:52.240
Shia, you're probably going to want to step back a little bit further. Here's your Gallagher,

32:52.240 --> 32:58.880
your Gallagher poncho. Just tuck into that real quick. Transform from a horse into a horse tank.

32:58.880 --> 33:05.280
You may get soaked. You will get wet with horse blood. With horse blood. That horse is not going

33:05.280 --> 33:11.200
to survive the transformation process. I'm sorry. I'll never tell anyone. You are rending parts of

33:11.200 --> 33:17.120
that horse that you will not be able to reattach. No, no. How come every time we talk about fucking

33:17.120 --> 33:21.680
horses on this show, we always talk about just mutilating them? How does that keep happening?

33:21.680 --> 33:24.800
Because there's something about destroying one of God's most beautiful creatures.

33:24.800 --> 33:30.000
It's so powerful and majestic. I just want to kill it.

33:30.000 --> 33:33.920
We've been going on this show for about 15 minutes now, designing the perfect horse,

33:33.920 --> 33:40.000
and we reached a point where we reached perfect horse that nobody's ever been

33:40.000 --> 33:44.880
able to conceive of before, and then we ruined it. Well, yes.

33:46.480 --> 33:51.360
We as human beings often are jealous of the power and majesty of a horse,

33:51.360 --> 33:57.680
and then it's time to destroy it. We reached the apex of horse possibilities.

33:57.680 --> 34:02.000
I think that the most important thing about a horse, the most important personality,

34:02.000 --> 34:06.400
let's get back to personality for a second. I think the most important personality of a horse

34:06.400 --> 34:11.760
is that it not be too beautiful, because then you want to destroy it. If you got some Jared

34:11.760 --> 34:16.080
Leto looking motherfucking horse, you're going to want to take a ball peed hammer to its temple

34:16.080 --> 34:21.040
instantly. It's too beautiful. It's just like Fight Club. You just want to destroy something

34:21.040 --> 34:27.040
beautiful, smash its face in with another horse. It's like a Twin Peaks slash glass menagerie

34:27.040 --> 34:32.000
glass horse with a horn on it somewhere, and you just want to destroy it.

34:32.000 --> 34:36.160
I just want to slam two horses together, find the god particle.

34:39.440 --> 34:42.240
Oh, shit. So horses.

34:43.120 --> 34:44.880
I hope no jockeys listen to our show.

34:46.240 --> 34:48.960
I hope no horses listen. There's going to be an uprising.

34:48.960 --> 34:53.440
Yeah. And a discrete uprising, but an uprising all the same.

34:53.440 --> 34:56.000
Griffin, I think it's time for a take a little trip.

34:56.720 --> 34:59.600
Sure. Let me strap into this roller coaster ride.

34:59.600 --> 35:00.480
Get on the saddle.

35:01.840 --> 35:03.200
The horse, the horse coaster.

35:03.200 --> 35:19.680
The horse coaster to the money.

35:19.680 --> 35:23.520
Tim Mitchell, Jenna, let me take you back.

35:23.520 --> 35:32.640
It's June 23rd, 2007, Des Moines, Iowa, a mountaintop.

35:32.640 --> 35:34.240
Is it angel singing?

35:35.760 --> 35:37.520
A discreet horse watches from afar.

35:40.240 --> 35:41.360
And the two of you get married.

35:42.800 --> 35:44.240
I mean, kill that horse.

35:44.240 --> 35:54.800
You, Tim, he's a combo geek. Her, domestic goddess, baking, sewing, feng shui, interior designing.

35:54.800 --> 35:55.360
No problem.

35:56.560 --> 35:59.760
Put that rug on the south end of the room because it's red.

36:00.640 --> 36:01.440
Because it's red.

36:01.440 --> 36:02.240
And you're a fire.

36:02.960 --> 36:04.880
And we're married for four years.

36:06.160 --> 36:09.120
Did I mean kids in this four years of wedded bliss?

36:09.120 --> 36:12.320
I think it's just around the corner. I have a good feeling about these things,

36:12.320 --> 36:14.400
but they do have an all black cat name.

36:15.200 --> 36:15.680
Here we go.

36:16.720 --> 36:17.280
Bagheera.

36:18.000 --> 36:18.480
Thank you.

36:18.480 --> 36:20.480
And an all white cat named.

36:20.480 --> 36:21.200
Luna.

36:21.200 --> 36:22.000
Luna.

36:22.000 --> 36:23.920
Cats are practically kids.

36:23.920 --> 36:29.120
They're like furry kids that they're like, you know what they are?

36:29.840 --> 36:30.320
Tell me.

36:30.320 --> 36:32.640
They're basically furry kids that are tiny.

36:32.640 --> 36:34.640
Cats are basically furry kids that are sneaky.

36:35.280 --> 36:37.040
Sneaky and they poop in sand.

36:37.040 --> 36:44.160
So by anybody's like system of measurement, they are better than kids.

36:44.880 --> 36:46.880
Because sometimes they don't want you around.

36:47.920 --> 36:51.440
His nickname for her is too personal to read on a comedy podcast.

36:52.000 --> 36:55.600
Her nickname for him is also too personal to read on a comedy podcast,

36:55.600 --> 36:59.040
but it's also funny and possibly embarrassing for him.

36:59.040 --> 36:59.920
That's Choo Choo.

37:00.480 --> 37:02.400
Hey, hey, Choo Choo.

37:03.200 --> 37:04.240
Come fix his light bulb.

37:04.240 --> 37:08.000
Oh, I don't know. I like, I like his, his nickname for her.

37:08.000 --> 37:08.800
I'm just going to say it.

37:08.800 --> 37:10.080
It's Bride.

37:10.080 --> 37:11.520
And I like Bride.

37:11.520 --> 37:13.200
I like utilitarian.

37:13.200 --> 37:13.760
It's yeah.

37:13.760 --> 37:16.720
It's very, it's very old school Amish.

37:16.720 --> 37:19.040
Like his name for her is wife.

37:19.040 --> 37:19.280
Yeah.

37:19.840 --> 37:20.400
Wife pride.

37:20.400 --> 37:21.440
Goodly wife.

37:21.440 --> 37:22.400
Goodly wife.

37:22.400 --> 37:23.200
Lady partner.

37:24.720 --> 37:26.720
Sately Bridesgroom.

37:26.720 --> 37:28.160
Is it grooms bride?

37:28.160 --> 37:29.280
Is that how that goes?

37:29.280 --> 37:30.000
I never understood that.

37:30.000 --> 37:30.720
Maidenhead.

37:31.440 --> 37:32.400
This is my.

37:32.400 --> 37:34.320
Is that, I don't know what that word means.

37:34.320 --> 37:35.520
Which I will build my life.

37:36.960 --> 37:39.680
She was traded to me for a fattened calf.

37:39.680 --> 37:41.280
And this is Choo Choo.

37:43.600 --> 37:45.360
The strongest man in the village.

37:45.360 --> 37:46.960
The strongest man in the village, Choo Choo.

37:46.960 --> 37:48.400
The powerful locomotive.

37:48.400 --> 37:50.160
Choo Choo, the titan approaches.

37:51.600 --> 37:52.160
Oh, fuck.

37:53.040 --> 37:55.680
They love to watch movies together and they listen to creative podcasts.

37:55.680 --> 37:56.640
I'm assuming like ours.

37:56.640 --> 37:58.160
So thank you for that.

37:58.720 --> 38:00.000
Also in the money zone.

38:00.000 --> 38:01.840
Also taking us along with Choo Choo.

38:01.840 --> 38:04.160
Ride, come on, ride the train and ride it.

38:04.160 --> 38:07.200
Fast karate for the gentlemen.

38:07.200 --> 38:11.680
It's a quickly paced, lightly sauced comedy show.

38:12.880 --> 38:14.080
Delicately sauced.

38:14.080 --> 38:15.200
It's about video games.

38:15.200 --> 38:17.120
It's about bad Japanese cartoons.

38:17.120 --> 38:22.160
And it only takes you like 30 or 60 minutes to listen to.

38:22.160 --> 38:23.040
That seems like a.

38:23.040 --> 38:24.640
So either one or double.

38:24.640 --> 38:28.400
It's kind of a scattershot approach to show time.

38:28.400 --> 38:30.720
No, they got the guts to say when it stops working.

38:30.720 --> 38:31.840
Maybe that'll be 30 minutes.

38:31.840 --> 38:32.880
Maybe it'll be 15 minutes.

38:32.880 --> 38:33.520
I don't know.

38:33.520 --> 38:36.320
Deaf can make it 30, but never above 60.

38:37.200 --> 38:38.080
It's a dumb.

38:38.880 --> 38:41.600
It says I'm not saying this about it.

38:41.600 --> 38:43.440
This is what they say about themselves.

38:43.440 --> 38:46.560
A dumb podcast recorded by two stupid jerks.

38:47.120 --> 38:51.360
I hope this podcast is not about branding or marketing because they're not good at it.

38:51.360 --> 38:57.120
But what they will do is they'll talk about seminal Kiefer Sutherland pro torture

38:57.120 --> 39:01.360
conservative TV classic 24 and then talk about pudding.

39:02.160 --> 39:02.560
Hold on.

39:02.560 --> 39:03.920
Talk about guardian heroes.

39:03.920 --> 39:04.320
Hold on.

39:04.320 --> 39:05.040
What?

39:05.040 --> 39:05.280
Okay.

39:06.000 --> 39:07.920
I don't listen to podcasts.

39:09.040 --> 39:13.280
I would get down on a pudding cast in a heartbeat.

39:14.320 --> 39:14.720
Yeah.

39:14.720 --> 39:16.640
Just talking about opportunity.

39:16.640 --> 39:17.440
Jellos.

39:17.440 --> 39:18.880
Just talking about flan.

39:19.840 --> 39:22.080
Which buffets had the best selection.

39:22.080 --> 39:26.240
Which golden corral pudding is served at the best temperature with.

39:26.240 --> 39:28.800
You guys ever had that one with Oreo bits in it?

39:28.800 --> 39:29.360
Fuck.

39:29.360 --> 39:30.160
Yes, I have.

39:30.160 --> 39:35.680
They could do a weekly segment on funny ways to mispronounce crumb brulee.

39:36.720 --> 39:37.600
Spoiler alert.

39:37.600 --> 39:38.720
It's crumb brulee.

39:41.760 --> 39:44.160
Crumb brulee sounds like some sort of sportsman.

39:44.960 --> 39:47.280
Hey, Frank, bring me some crumb brulee.

39:49.120 --> 39:51.760
You got crumb brulee with the crunchy cinnamon toffee.

39:51.760 --> 39:52.560
I can't make it.

39:52.560 --> 39:54.000
I ran out of crumb fresh.

39:54.000 --> 39:57.280
If you want to listen to the internet's premier pudding cast,

39:57.280 --> 40:03.520
you can do so at www.daveandjole.com.

40:03.520 --> 40:04.960
That's their website for them.

40:04.960 --> 40:05.840
Oh, wow.

40:05.840 --> 40:06.080
Okay.

40:08.080 --> 40:13.600
So thank you to Tim Mitchell who wished his wife Jenna a happy anniversary

40:13.600 --> 40:14.960
and fast karate for the gentlemen.

40:16.400 --> 40:20.640
And now my favorite, my favorite moment that I've really been waiting for.

40:21.520 --> 40:22.800
Which acts do you guys want this time?

40:22.800 --> 40:24.560
You want standard E tuning or open C?

40:24.560 --> 40:25.440
Because I can do either one.

40:26.400 --> 40:27.360
Do you have your double net?

40:30.000 --> 40:33.040
Can you just do maybe some drop D?

40:33.040 --> 40:34.960
Is that a tuning option that's open to us?

40:35.760 --> 40:37.440
What about middle J?

40:37.440 --> 40:41.200
I can take that open C and drop a capo on fret two, and it's basically the same thing.

40:41.760 --> 40:42.560
All right, let's do it.

40:42.560 --> 40:43.920
Are you guys still talking about guitars?

40:45.440 --> 40:45.600
Yeah.

40:46.480 --> 40:50.320
Travis, I wish you would learn an instrument so that I don't have to keep doing this.

40:50.320 --> 40:53.760
I learned recorder in fourth grade.

40:53.760 --> 40:56.240
You can't sing a jingle and play recorder with yourself.

40:56.960 --> 40:57.520
Yes, you can.

40:58.880 --> 41:00.160
Yes, you fucking can.

41:00.160 --> 41:01.440
Don't you tell him you can't do that.

41:01.440 --> 41:02.560
That's the best idea.

41:05.040 --> 41:05.520
Fuck.

41:05.520 --> 41:09.200
Okay, so a fourth wedding anniversary and a pudding cast.

41:09.840 --> 41:10.320
Thanks.

41:10.320 --> 41:14.560
Hey guys, if like the two of you guys could maybe get together next time

41:14.560 --> 41:18.640
and try and find like two things that have similar thematic elements.

41:18.640 --> 41:20.960
Anything, anything.

41:20.960 --> 41:22.080
By the way, by the way,

41:23.680 --> 41:26.400
paying for a personal message on your wife's,

41:27.120 --> 41:30.960
you and your wife's fourth anniversary is a out loud statement

41:30.960 --> 41:34.000
that either us or your marriage will not be here in a year.

41:34.000 --> 41:37.360
There's no other message that I could take from that.

41:37.360 --> 41:40.800
And since you love your wife, bride and your husband Chuchu,

41:40.800 --> 41:43.440
I can only assume that you're saying we will not be doing this.

41:43.440 --> 41:46.880
We better throw this out now because in a year's time, it'll be too late.

41:46.880 --> 41:47.120
Yeah.

41:47.120 --> 41:47.620
Okay.

41:48.400 --> 41:49.040
So thanks.

41:49.920 --> 41:50.160
Thanks.

41:50.160 --> 41:50.880
I appreciate that.

41:53.920 --> 41:56.640
The only thing I can think of right now is the matrimony train.

41:57.680 --> 42:00.880
Take the matrimony train to pudding station.

42:00.880 --> 42:02.800
To pudding new, pudding new station.

42:04.160 --> 42:05.200
Pudding new station?

42:05.200 --> 42:06.960
Is that like Shining Time Station?

42:06.960 --> 42:09.520
Can you do it to the tune of Dave Matthews Band's Crash?

42:12.480 --> 42:14.160
Um, no.

42:14.160 --> 42:21.440
Chuchu and Bride, they eat pudding.

42:21.440 --> 42:22.240
That's good.

42:22.240 --> 42:27.760
See, the problem is that we'll get taken down by a digital millennium copyright act

42:29.760 --> 42:30.800
from D&B himself.

42:38.400 --> 42:39.520
That's a little too dark.

42:40.720 --> 42:41.680
Oh, wow.

42:41.680 --> 42:41.920
Yeah.

42:41.920 --> 42:44.240
Get on the matrimony train.

42:45.600 --> 42:48.960
We're gonna take a trip.

42:48.960 --> 42:49.600
Nope, Chuch.

42:49.600 --> 42:50.720
I'm gonna use the other guitar.

42:50.720 --> 42:51.680
I think that's the problem.

42:53.040 --> 42:54.080
That's the problem.

42:54.640 --> 42:57.200
It's not that you're trying to write an impromptu song.

42:57.200 --> 42:59.120
A song about fucking wedding and also a pudding podcast.

43:00.400 --> 43:01.200
God damn it.

43:01.760 --> 43:02.640
God damn it.

43:02.640 --> 43:13.200
Can we agree that would be Pudcast?

43:13.200 --> 43:17.760
Hey, who's that coming down the aisle?

43:19.440 --> 43:30.960
It's a beautiful woman in white and she's carrying in her left hand a tube of gogurt

43:30.960 --> 43:44.560
and her man on one arm she has her chuchu in the other arm she has the aforementioned

43:44.560 --> 43:51.600
gogurt and she's slurping down the gogurt and she's saying her vows they have for long

43:51.600 --> 43:57.440
years together and they're not stopping now they're on the matrimony train

43:57.440 --> 44:01.280
to pudding town

44:08.320 --> 44:08.820
Yay!

44:09.520 --> 44:10.800
That was good.

44:10.800 --> 44:11.760
Hold up.

44:11.760 --> 44:13.120
I'm not positive though.

44:14.720 --> 44:16.560
Is gogurt yogurt?

44:17.920 --> 44:19.280
Gogurt is definitely yogurt.

44:19.280 --> 44:22.080
I'm gonna say there's a 50% chance that gogurt is pudding.

44:22.080 --> 44:26.640
I think that it's like squares and rectangles where not all gogurts are pudding but all

44:26.640 --> 44:27.360
puddings are gogurt.

44:27.360 --> 44:28.080
Well, here's the thing.

44:29.600 --> 44:33.520
Yogurt is basically bullshit nasty pudding with cultures in it.

44:34.800 --> 44:35.040
Right.

44:35.040 --> 44:37.120
To help Jamie Lee Curtis do her poopies.

44:40.080 --> 44:41.600
It says that right on the box.

44:42.960 --> 44:46.320
Slam this gogurt and have regular beaners like JLC.

44:46.320 --> 44:50.560
Slam down this gogurt and then enjoy a Jamie Lee Curtis style poopy.

44:50.560 --> 44:56.000
Every time a child eats a gogurt, Jamie Lee Curtis makes a poopy.

44:56.000 --> 44:56.800
Oh god.

44:56.800 --> 44:59.120
That must explain why she hasn't been doing much acting lately.

45:00.880 --> 45:02.320
Yogurt got so popular.

45:03.040 --> 45:07.760
Kids, stop eating gogurt for the love of Jamie Lee Curtis.

45:07.760 --> 45:08.800
Please lay off the gogurt.

45:08.800 --> 45:09.760
She's so tired.

45:12.000 --> 45:12.800
So raw.

45:12.800 --> 45:14.160
It's so raw.

45:14.160 --> 45:16.320
I wish I could trade places with anybody.

45:16.320 --> 45:17.680
Kids, please stop.

45:17.680 --> 45:19.040
This is no true lie.

45:19.040 --> 45:25.600
So if you would like your own jingle and spot in the money zone, you can contact

45:25.600 --> 45:29.920
Teresa Thorn at Teresa at maximum fun dot org.

45:29.920 --> 45:30.800
Teresa with an H.

45:31.360 --> 45:37.600
My boyfriend and I disagree on what the term underwear for women refers to.

45:38.160 --> 45:43.600
I told him it's just the bottoms, but he's convinced it's both bra and panties.

45:43.600 --> 45:48.800
Oh, Justin, you said that in the grossest way imaginable.

45:48.800 --> 45:50.560
To be fair, it's the grossest word.

45:50.560 --> 45:51.760
It's the worst word.

45:51.760 --> 45:53.440
Just panties.

45:53.440 --> 45:54.400
Oh, god.

45:54.400 --> 45:56.640
What do you guys think?

45:56.640 --> 45:57.600
His name's Jeff.

45:58.320 --> 46:03.680
So if you could prove him wrong, prove, because that's what we're into on NBA scientific proof.

46:03.680 --> 46:06.160
We're going to peer review this shit hypothesis.

46:08.080 --> 46:13.920
My hypothesis is that underwear for ladies and this is just my opening statement.

46:13.920 --> 46:20.160
OK, I believe that underwear for ladies refers to both bra and panties.

46:20.160 --> 46:23.040
Oh, God, please, please, please.

46:23.040 --> 46:24.320
Let me just say bottoms.

46:24.320 --> 46:28.480
Can we say bottoms and avoid that we just can we say bottoms?

46:28.480 --> 46:30.560
Can we just say girl boxers or girl briefs?

46:30.560 --> 46:31.040
Yeah.

46:31.040 --> 46:36.000
Or like, OK, we can we can remove panties from the discussion because that's the last time

46:36.000 --> 46:38.880
you get to say that word without me quitting the podcast forever.

46:39.440 --> 46:40.640
OK, obviously.

46:40.640 --> 46:41.200
What is it?

46:41.200 --> 46:42.160
Just the pronunciation?

46:42.640 --> 46:46.960
You're saying it like some kind of super villain that seals women's underwear and collects

46:46.960 --> 46:47.920
it in a cave.

46:48.480 --> 46:51.600
So so no more no more discussion of panties.

46:51.600 --> 46:58.080
Um, I think that the the the the discussion, the debate is really over bra.

46:59.040 --> 47:00.720
I think that it only refers to bottoms.

47:02.000 --> 47:02.480
Really?

47:02.480 --> 47:10.240
Yeah, because, OK, take the the bottoms out of the equation and a girl just putting on

47:10.240 --> 47:12.160
her bra saying, I'm putting on my underwear.

47:12.960 --> 47:14.000
She's a crazy person.

47:14.880 --> 47:17.440
Oh, man, that's a pretty good argument.

47:17.440 --> 47:19.440
That is a really, really good argument.

47:19.440 --> 47:20.000
I know, right?

47:20.000 --> 47:22.320
Can we just can we get rid of the nomenclature altogether?

47:22.320 --> 47:28.320
And can we just call like just come up with a specific like but like your your your panties

47:28.320 --> 47:36.160
will now be called bottom bottom shorts and your bra is can be called like boob shorts.

47:36.160 --> 47:37.040
Your booby shorts.

47:37.040 --> 47:37.760
Your booby shorts.

47:37.760 --> 47:40.320
These are shorts for your boobs so that nobody can see them.

47:41.440 --> 47:44.160
Hey, get those cans and some booby shorts today.

47:44.160 --> 47:53.440
Uh huh, uh, I OK, I think Travis has in in sort of unprecedented feet from a brother

47:53.440 --> 47:54.480
of a brother than me.

47:54.480 --> 47:59.600
Travis is sort of single handedly, I think, won this argument because I think that the

47:59.600 --> 48:03.760
thing about, you know, separating it, saying like, that's my underwear.

48:04.640 --> 48:05.840
That's weird as shit, right?

48:05.840 --> 48:06.240
It's weird.

48:06.240 --> 48:13.360
And you can't say on the following that you can't say I am I am wearing I'm wearing booby

48:13.360 --> 48:19.280
shorts but no panties, so I am wearing my underwear and it's like I beg to differ.

48:19.280 --> 48:23.280
I like putting on a shirt and saying this is my chest pants like it's craziness.

48:23.280 --> 48:25.120
That means you look like a crazy person.

48:25.120 --> 48:27.040
I think that case closed.

48:27.040 --> 48:27.840
Final solution.

48:28.480 --> 48:29.120
Sorry, Jeff.

48:29.120 --> 48:31.200
So Jeff, you're wrong.

48:31.200 --> 48:32.320
Sorry, Jeff.

48:32.320 --> 48:33.200
You're so wrong.

48:33.920 --> 48:37.840
Welcome to a new segment of my brother, my brother and me, where we stop giving advice

48:37.840 --> 48:39.840
and just belittle someone's opinion.

48:39.840 --> 48:40.480
Hey, Jeff.

48:41.680 --> 48:42.480
You're stupid.

48:42.480 --> 48:44.160
Can we just get rid of it?

48:44.160 --> 48:46.400
Can we just get rid of this whole thing altogether?

48:46.400 --> 48:48.880
Just you mean the whole bra panty enterprise?

48:48.880 --> 48:50.640
Let him breathe, ladies.

48:50.640 --> 48:51.280
Yeah.

48:51.280 --> 48:55.600
Oh, you're saying like the real tangible items.

48:56.640 --> 48:58.880
So Griffin, which which frat did you rush?

48:58.880 --> 48:59.440
I'm curious.

49:00.240 --> 49:08.400
Delta, Delta, Delta, Delta, Delta, Delta, Delta, Delta, they're good.

49:08.400 --> 49:12.800
Quint Delta fucking killer ultimate Frisbee team.

49:12.800 --> 49:15.200
We wanted that Delta so it could be sexed out.

49:16.240 --> 49:18.480
But nobody we couldn't have it.

49:18.480 --> 49:19.600
It wouldn't give it ridiculous.

49:21.120 --> 49:22.640
Griffin, you know what I need?

49:22.640 --> 49:24.720
I said a gross thing in there about getting rid of panties.

49:24.720 --> 49:26.400
So ladies can let him breathe.

49:26.400 --> 49:29.680
And it's like that was so grody to like even joke about.

49:29.680 --> 49:31.920
And I don't know if I should like cut it out of the show or no.

49:33.920 --> 49:37.200
But if you don't say the gross thing about letting him breathe, we can't joke about Quint

49:37.200 --> 49:37.920
Delta.

49:37.920 --> 49:38.480
That's right.

49:38.480 --> 49:38.880
Fuck.

49:38.880 --> 49:40.560
You got to die on the comedy cross.

49:42.320 --> 49:43.840
How about man?

49:43.840 --> 49:44.640
Fuck it, guys.

49:44.640 --> 49:46.560
I have like five really, really good ones.

49:47.680 --> 49:48.000
Good.

49:48.000 --> 49:51.120
Maybe next time you won't have to hound our dear sweet listeners.

49:51.120 --> 49:54.320
You just keep your own strategic reserve.

49:54.320 --> 49:57.520
We're going to do this one because it's the fucking craziest thing I've ever read.

49:58.160 --> 49:59.840
It's by Jacob Locker, of course.

50:00.480 --> 50:03.440
It's by Yahoo Answers user Gabby Bennett, who asks.

50:03.440 --> 50:06.320
Why would my grandpa kiss my foot?

50:07.200 --> 50:13.120
Why was I was I was I was getting a much needed foot massage for my grandpa.

50:13.120 --> 50:15.280
Scott, you know, stop it with Seuss.

50:15.840 --> 50:19.520
And when he kissed and when he finished, he kissed my foot.

50:19.520 --> 50:20.400
Should I be worried?

50:21.120 --> 50:22.160
Additional details.

50:22.160 --> 50:24.640
Well, he's technically my grandpa by marriage.

50:24.640 --> 50:29.200
He married my grandma in March, but he gave my mom a foot massage and she said she was

50:29.200 --> 50:30.000
weirded out.

50:30.000 --> 50:36.640
So there's a there's a first of all, roaming step grandpa giving foot rubs to everybody.

50:36.640 --> 50:38.240
Get him out of the house.

50:38.240 --> 50:44.080
There's precedent set by the mom getting the massage and not particularly enjoying it.

50:44.080 --> 50:45.760
So that's pretty crazy, right?

50:45.760 --> 50:47.760
That's like a crazy fucking thing.

50:47.760 --> 50:49.680
That's like a crazy, crazy thing.

50:49.680 --> 50:50.720
How about some of these?

50:50.720 --> 50:54.240
Let's let's dip into these answers and just like, you know, let's pull the crowd.

50:54.240 --> 50:55.200
Let's pull the audience.

50:55.200 --> 50:56.160
Pull the audience.

50:56.160 --> 50:58.080
Let's phone a friend on Yahoo.

50:58.080 --> 51:00.880
Answer one, Jacob Cahill says, what?

51:00.880 --> 51:02.560
No, he's your grandpa and he loves you.

51:02.560 --> 51:03.600
That's a good thing.

51:03.600 --> 51:04.960
He's not our grandpa.

51:04.960 --> 51:07.520
No, that one's got to be like a crazy outlier, right?

51:07.520 --> 51:08.800
Well, answer it.

51:08.800 --> 51:14.320
I just want to throw out real quick that he's only been her grandpa for like three months.

51:14.320 --> 51:14.800
Right.

51:14.800 --> 51:17.120
Pretty much not your grandpa yet.

51:17.920 --> 51:20.560
You got to earn that title over at least a period of half a year.

51:20.560 --> 51:22.240
Gabe Fore says, not at all.

51:22.240 --> 51:23.840
He's just being a loving grandpa.

51:23.840 --> 51:25.840
It's like a kiss on the forehead or something like that.

51:25.840 --> 51:29.440
Being a loving grandpa, it's like a kiss on the forehead or something, but just a loving thing.

51:30.000 --> 51:30.240
No.

51:31.040 --> 51:33.120
It would be weird if he was touchy or kissed you on the lips.

51:33.120 --> 51:35.440
But a kiss on the foot is just a loving grandpa thing.

51:36.000 --> 51:37.440
What are you saying?

51:37.440 --> 51:38.400
How is your grandpa?

51:38.400 --> 51:41.760
What kind of fucking situation is going on in America with our grand-

51:41.760 --> 51:43.520
What is our grandpa situation like that?

51:43.520 --> 51:45.120
Everyone's like, no, it's completely normal.

51:45.120 --> 51:47.280
My grandpappy kisses me on the feet all the time.

51:48.000 --> 51:49.680
Elizabeth says, I don't think so.

51:50.960 --> 51:51.840
Stop it, gramps.

51:52.640 --> 51:54.400
Elizabeth says, I don't think so.

51:54.400 --> 51:57.120
Was it a small peck kind of kiss or a deep passionate kiss?

51:57.120 --> 51:58.320
And you know what doesn't matter?

51:58.880 --> 52:00.560
Hey, Elizabeth, it kind of doesn't matter.

52:02.240 --> 52:04.320
Deep passionate kiss, creepy.

52:04.320 --> 52:07.520
Quick peck on the foot, just as creepy.

52:07.520 --> 52:10.400
Like, did you put the tip in or did you go shafty?

52:10.400 --> 52:10.880
Doesn't matter.

52:10.880 --> 52:11.680
You're pregnant.

52:11.680 --> 52:12.960
Like it's over.

52:12.960 --> 52:13.760
It's over.

52:13.760 --> 52:16.080
You can only get so foot creepy wet.

52:17.440 --> 52:20.560
Chiquita Bonita says, no, I think you're just taking it a little too weird

52:20.560 --> 52:22.480
because it's not something that you're used to.

52:22.480 --> 52:24.800
This is, guys, I'm not leaving any answers out.

52:24.800 --> 52:27.280
Wait, say that one one more time.

52:27.280 --> 52:30.160
It's only creepy because it's not something you're used to?

52:30.160 --> 52:31.680
Because it's not something you're used to.

52:32.400 --> 52:34.960
Isn't that kind of the definition of like weird?

52:34.960 --> 52:35.460
Yeah.

52:36.320 --> 52:36.800
I'm-

52:36.800 --> 52:39.600
No, you just think it's weird because it's something that's never happened before.

52:39.600 --> 52:40.960
It's completely unacceptable.

52:40.960 --> 52:44.400
To a certain level of my grandpa kissing my sweet feet.

52:45.280 --> 52:46.080
Uh-huh.

52:46.080 --> 52:47.600
Guys, it's not funny anymore.

52:47.600 --> 52:51.280
I can't laugh about this.

52:51.280 --> 52:57.440
There is a nation of people who says it might be a good luck superstition,

52:57.440 --> 52:58.880
or he thinks of you as royalty.

52:59.680 --> 53:01.440
Yeah, because that's exactly what it is.

53:01.440 --> 53:02.080
Nailed it.

53:02.080 --> 53:03.120
By reason it is.

53:03.120 --> 53:08.880
There are a bunch of people on the internet and they think that it's okay for their-

53:08.880 --> 53:10.560
Like it's not funny to me anymore.

53:10.560 --> 53:15.120
BeautifulTip1 says, I think he was just trying to show honest, innocent affection.

53:15.120 --> 53:16.000
Nothing curvy.

53:16.720 --> 53:20.000
Nothing a grandpa does is innocent ever.

53:20.000 --> 53:24.400
Our grandpas are trying to keep their raging old man libido back

53:24.400 --> 53:28.160
and you let them wrap their digits around some tea bopper's foot

53:28.800 --> 53:30.720
and her feet still-

53:30.720 --> 53:34.400
Their feet still sway from being inside those hush puppies all day

53:34.400 --> 53:36.480
and you can't expect the man not to kiss them.

53:36.480 --> 53:38.400
You're fucking grossing me out, Gramps.

53:38.400 --> 53:39.680
Get out of here, you old man.

53:40.800 --> 53:41.600
There are eight-

53:42.320 --> 53:44.880
There are eight answers on this question.

53:45.520 --> 53:46.560
All of them are.

53:47.120 --> 53:48.720
No, he's being a grandpa.

53:48.720 --> 53:50.080
Here, here's a Werther's.

53:50.080 --> 53:51.760
Let me suck them toes.

53:51.760 --> 53:54.480
Hey, hey, I want to take this one a little deeper.

53:55.360 --> 53:59.280
Why did she have to go on the internet to find out if this was weird or not?

53:59.280 --> 54:04.720
What have we done to our nation's youth that has made them like require the internet for a second opinion?

54:04.720 --> 54:06.560
Do we need to drop some PSAs?

54:06.560 --> 54:10.640
Hey, uh, Peepaw, I just logged on on your Pentium computer.

54:10.640 --> 54:12.960
Why do you have eight Yahoo Answers accounts?

54:12.960 --> 54:17.440
What is the purpose of those?

54:17.440 --> 54:19.120
Of those right now.

54:21.360 --> 54:23.200
Griffin, I want to hear your last question.

54:23.200 --> 54:26.480
And I know that we could stay here and joke about this all day.

54:26.480 --> 54:27.840
It's not fucking humorous.

54:27.840 --> 54:32.160
Like, this makes you want to cry into a cup of poison.

54:32.160 --> 54:36.400
I'm completely happy joking about killing God's most beautiful creature.

54:37.120 --> 54:41.200
When it comes to kissing little girl's feet, game over.

54:41.200 --> 54:46.800
I would rather ride a beautiful horse and not kill it than continue to talk about this.

54:46.800 --> 54:52.720
Every time you grandpa kisses their their offspring's offspring's feet,

54:53.280 --> 54:57.040
step offspring step offspring step their step offspring offspring's feet.

54:57.840 --> 54:59.440
A horse is destroyed.

54:59.440 --> 55:01.760
And also, Jamie Lee Curtis has a bowel movement.

55:03.520 --> 55:04.800
So she's a busy lady.

55:04.800 --> 55:07.920
She has a lot on her plate because she has to.

55:07.920 --> 55:11.680
Well, to be fair, she never should have signed that sponsorship contract.

55:11.680 --> 55:13.600
Yeah, she should have read it first.

55:13.600 --> 55:14.160
She should have.

55:14.160 --> 55:14.720
She should have.

55:14.720 --> 55:20.400
Uh, yeah, it's a fine print forever and ever.

55:21.040 --> 55:22.880
I want to hear his last question first.

55:22.880 --> 55:24.720
A couple of real quick housekeeping things.

55:24.720 --> 55:31.280
Thank you to female Kyle for posting the Equus video, I guess.

55:31.280 --> 55:33.040
Thank you, I guess.

55:33.040 --> 55:34.000
Yeah, thanks for that.

55:34.000 --> 55:38.640
I love that the top Google result is a video of my of my brother

55:38.640 --> 55:40.640
penetrating my butt with a beer bottle.

55:40.640 --> 55:45.120
That's really good, so my future job opportunities in short are

55:45.120 --> 55:46.640
five years get pretty weird.

55:46.640 --> 55:47.200
You should come out.

55:47.200 --> 55:52.160
Um, that's OK, guys, because I was pretending to be a horse.

55:52.160 --> 55:54.400
So it's totally so it's totally fine.

55:54.400 --> 55:55.840
That was five thirteen.

55:55.840 --> 55:56.560
That's Lori.

55:56.560 --> 56:01.280
Uh, uh, confirm that Travis looked hubba hubba at the live show.

56:01.280 --> 56:04.400
Do you want to point out Travis put together these Twitter shout outs?

56:04.400 --> 56:07.360
So I was I was flattered.

56:07.360 --> 56:11.040
I was flattered, and I agree.

56:12.160 --> 56:14.080
Media underscore fairy.

56:14.720 --> 56:18.000
She risked her job to convert to customers.

56:19.360 --> 56:22.400
So thank you to an emergency brain surgeon.

56:23.200 --> 56:25.760
And what she did was she got deep down in someone's cerebrum

56:26.800 --> 56:28.960
and then I touched the part of their brain that made them like

56:28.960 --> 56:30.320
listening to the weird podcasts.

56:31.760 --> 56:32.560
So thank you for that.

56:32.560 --> 56:33.360
That's just right.

56:33.360 --> 56:35.920
God, we got an email from Kara.

56:35.920 --> 56:40.080
And Kara asked why we don't have a fan club and that she wanted to

56:40.080 --> 56:43.120
start a fan club and how to do that and all that kind of stuff

56:43.120 --> 56:44.880
called the maximum fund.org.

56:46.080 --> 56:47.200
That's not a fan club.

56:47.200 --> 56:49.920
Like that's the nomenclature of fan club.

56:51.200 --> 56:53.280
By the way, fun drinking game for this episode.

56:53.280 --> 56:56.320
Every time we say the word nomenclature, just take a sip of your beverage.

56:56.320 --> 56:57.440
Yeah, it's it's not.

56:57.440 --> 57:04.320
It's a it's a it's a fan community, a think tank of like minded individuals.

57:04.320 --> 57:06.480
OK, I like that tank.

57:07.520 --> 57:10.960
And and it's it's a great it's a great community and you should be on there.

57:10.960 --> 57:12.080
They're good people.

57:12.080 --> 57:14.400
You should also be listening to all the other maximum fun shows.

57:15.040 --> 57:16.720
Yeah, I think the people who I meant to mention,

57:16.720 --> 57:18.880
the people who asked about panty nomenclature.

57:20.240 --> 57:22.080
Panty, did you say that you should really?

57:22.080 --> 57:26.000
That's a question for for the John Hodgman Hodgman podcast.

57:27.520 --> 57:30.160
That's more his wheelhouse, our close personal friend.

57:30.160 --> 57:37.520
John are basically our best friend and second dad and step grandfather.

57:37.520 --> 57:39.440
Jordan, just to get out and self-podcast yourself.

57:40.960 --> 57:43.360
Also, and this is speaking of maximum fun,

57:44.640 --> 57:51.280
the main reason you need to get over there is you need to see the MBMB AM super show,

57:51.280 --> 57:53.120
which is a cartoon made by Christopew,

57:53.120 --> 57:56.560
Sean Depew, the Depew brothers will put it in the forums.

57:56.560 --> 58:02.640
You can also go to bit.ly forward slash MBMB AM tune one.

58:02.640 --> 58:04.320
That's a little shortcut.

58:04.320 --> 58:05.600
Pretty good URL you got there.

58:06.240 --> 58:08.400
It's really, really fantastic.

58:08.400 --> 58:13.200
We can't thank the Depew brothers enough because it's it's it's unthinkably magical.

58:13.200 --> 58:16.080
It's a cartoon of one of our bits.

58:16.080 --> 58:18.080
If you want to see more of them,

58:19.040 --> 58:21.520
if you would write them a giant check,

58:21.520 --> 58:24.640
a giant novelty check to keep making them because you love them so much,

58:24.640 --> 58:29.760
let let them know, let us know, talk about it in the forums, share your adoration.

58:29.760 --> 58:32.960
We'll put it up there right as soon as we're done recording this SOTO.

58:32.960 --> 58:36.800
It'll be there and you should check it totally out.

58:38.400 --> 58:39.280
Is that everything?

58:39.280 --> 58:42.800
I want to thank Mr. Bob Ball.

58:42.800 --> 58:43.920
Oh, yeah.

58:43.920 --> 58:48.160
Bob Ball does the voice intro for a show every single week.

58:48.160 --> 58:51.360
He flies to one of our houses and he records it fresh

58:51.360 --> 58:55.120
because he he doesn't like to he doesn't like the sound to get stale, he says,

58:55.120 --> 58:58.720
which like we've tried to explain to him that that's physically not how it works,

58:58.720 --> 58:59.760
but he won't have it.

59:01.280 --> 59:02.080
Freshest sounds.

59:02.080 --> 59:02.800
That's all he'll settle for.

59:02.800 --> 59:04.000
Thank you so much, Bob Ball.

59:04.960 --> 59:06.560
And thank you, of course, to all of you.

59:06.560 --> 59:11.760
If you get a second, please tell somebody that you care about to listen to the show.

59:11.760 --> 59:18.160
Send them a link to our sampler bit.ly forward slash it's MBMB AM.

59:18.800 --> 59:20.000
And we haven't mentioned in a while,

59:20.000 --> 59:24.480
but if if you've joined the show in like the last 20 or so episodes

59:24.480 --> 59:28.880
and you haven't yet gone on iTunes and thrown us a ranking or a view or something,

59:28.880 --> 59:30.000

59:31.360 --> 59:32.640
So we've got an app there, too.

59:33.200 --> 59:37.280
An MBMB AM app experience that you can get on iTunes.

59:38.000 --> 59:40.400
Also, Happy Father's Day.

59:40.400 --> 59:41.200
Yeah.

59:41.200 --> 59:42.640
Hey, Papa McElroy.

59:42.640 --> 59:43.920
Happy Father's Day.

59:43.920 --> 59:48.880

at McClint, M-A-C-C-L-I-N-T.

59:53.120 --> 59:54.320
I think it's just one word.

59:54.320 --> 59:55.440
It's just Twitter handle.

59:55.440 --> 59:57.120
Just like send him a message saying,

59:59.600 --> 01:00:00.480
Good job, Dad.

01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:03.040
Thanks for spawning three awesome children.

01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:03.440
Yeah.

01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:04.560
Well, four.

01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:05.760
And then we lost Terry.

01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:06.000
Yeah.

01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:08.240
He was a bad guy.

01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:09.440
Didn't have the chops.

01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:10.880
Couldn't have the chops to cut it.

01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:11.380
Life.

01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:13.760
Griffin, last question.

01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:14.160
I'm ready.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:16.800
Okay.

01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:20.400
Feel around your skin.

01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:22.080
This one was sent in by Krista Whalen.

01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:22.800
Thank you, Krista.

01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:27.440
