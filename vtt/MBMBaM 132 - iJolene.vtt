00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:52.240
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to The Garden, the internet's number one resource for swinging,

00:52.240 --> 00:58.000
adults, the swinging lifestyle, and all the all the stuff that goes in between.

00:58.000 --> 01:01.680
I am your pleasure guardian, Bruce Bruceon.

01:04.000 --> 01:10.800
I can't do this. And I'm Hank the Spank Tank Jankerson Jankersleyton.

01:11.600 --> 01:16.160
Hank, we did we did talk about trying to keep the volume down. We have a lot of

01:16.160 --> 01:20.240
I'm excited about fucking other people's wives pussies.

01:20.240 --> 01:26.000
Sure, sure, sure. It's understandable. Who could be why? Who wouldn't be excited about

01:26.000 --> 01:30.960
here's your first hour. Here's first Hank Spank Tank Jankerson's pro tip.

01:32.400 --> 01:38.240
Find the find the best but you can best to find the best but in the room and just get it and have it.

01:39.840 --> 01:46.160
Of course, that is with consent. Maybe that but maybe that buts on a man. Hank came here to judge.

01:47.840 --> 01:51.920
Well, we should all be open, I think, to different possibilities. There's a lot of

01:51.920 --> 01:56.080
liberation in that and accepting. I think I walked in the wrong recording booth.

01:57.200 --> 02:03.440
Well, we thought we will clear out soon. We know that the brother brother brother chat.

02:03.440 --> 02:07.520
Yeah, brother chat is supposed to be man. You're gonna want to get a squeegee in here,

02:07.520 --> 02:14.080
man, before you start recording because there is gonna get there's some leaving brother chat is

02:14.080 --> 02:19.360
actually the number two podcast for swinging adults and everything in between. So I'm sorry,

02:19.360 --> 02:24.720
was it Travis? Yes, Travis. If you just step out of this recording studio, head down the hall,

02:25.520 --> 02:29.120
I'm sure you'll find the guys you're looking for. OK, click.

02:34.320 --> 02:40.000
Man, that guy with the suction cup shoes, he really freaked me out. I was trying to do a

02:40.000 --> 02:44.560
little a little Prairie Home Companion sound effects. Some Foley. I liked it. This is my

02:44.560 --> 02:49.120
brother, my brother, me, an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

02:49.120 --> 02:56.320
I'm your middle brother, Travis McElroy. No, stop the world. You messed up your name.

02:58.160 --> 03:04.000
You said Trevor. I actually said Traver, but I'm your sweet baby brother,

03:04.800 --> 03:11.120
Hank the Spank Tank Jankersleyton. You guys ever notice that Griffin and Hank the Spank Tank are

03:11.120 --> 03:14.960
never in the same room at the same time? Interesting. Some people have noticed that

03:14.960 --> 03:19.280
actually Griffin looks like Hank the Spank Tank Jankersleyton, but with glasses on,

03:20.640 --> 03:26.400
which I'm beginning to see through their ruse. What we do on this show is we take your questions

03:26.400 --> 03:30.640
and then we turn them alchemy like into wisdom. Let's get right into the queries.

03:32.400 --> 03:39.040
Last week, I worked a really long 24 hour shift at my retail job. My boss, seeing my dedication,

03:39.040 --> 03:44.000
decided to buy me lunch. He handed me his credit card and sent me on my way. I ended up spending

03:44.000 --> 03:50.960
$17 on an amazing burger and fries. Now, mind you, this is NYC and it's a higher end burger spot.

03:50.960 --> 03:56.320
My question is how much is an appropriate amount to spend when your boss offers to buy you lunch?

03:56.320 --> 04:01.440
Did I spend too much? I don't want my boss to think I took advantage of his kind offer.

04:02.240 --> 04:06.960
That's from Stuffed in NYC. Wait, wait, wait. First and foremost,

04:06.960 --> 04:12.720
you worked a 24 hour shift? Yeah, with that in mind, like your boss is lucky that you didn't

04:12.720 --> 04:19.200
just take him and then fart on the card before you gave it back because that's bananas.

04:19.840 --> 04:25.600
The old stinky plastic. Blaster card.

04:25.600 --> 04:34.800
The blaster card. Are you asking the technical or the real life? Because technically,

04:34.800 --> 04:38.400
when he offers to buy you lunch, it's your choice and you can get whatever you want.

04:38.400 --> 04:44.000
I think technically speaking, you committed a federal crime. You used somebody else's credit

04:44.000 --> 04:48.080
card. That's an important issue. That doesn't even mean anything anymore in this day and age.

04:48.080 --> 04:55.200
Really? Am I antiquated? No, honestly, the other day, my boss sent me to buy a projector for the

04:55.200 --> 05:03.120
office and it was a pretty big purchase and I'm sitting there in paint stained jeans and t-shirt

05:03.120 --> 05:10.880
and I'm like, I want to buy this very expensive projector with this card that is not the same name

05:10.880 --> 05:17.600
as my ID, which you just checked and dude is just like, okay. I bought groceries the other day with

05:17.600 --> 05:22.080
my credit card and it gave me the prompt to put in my signature and hit accept, but I just hit

05:22.080 --> 05:28.000
accept and input my signature and it went through and I just felt like taking out my wallet and just

05:28.000 --> 05:31.360
dumping it out on the floor and just saying, all right, everybody have at it because apparently

05:31.360 --> 05:37.600
there's no security on these goddamn things at all. I took Teresa's card to go buy a video game

05:37.600 --> 05:45.520
for Secret Santa present and Tudor looked at the card, saw that it said Teresa and was like, okay.

05:47.520 --> 05:53.360
Why do we even care anymore? Yeah, why are you even trying? I don't think $17 is obnoxious for-

05:54.240 --> 05:59.920
Who the fuck knows how rich their boss is in this world? Who knows? That's true.

05:59.920 --> 06:07.040
Like every time I've gone out to dinner with a boss, they eat like a steak made out of bouillon

06:07.040 --> 06:13.600
and it's like, okay. I didn't know that this is where you were, fungibly speaking,

06:13.600 --> 06:18.960
but congratulations, Mr. 1%. Also, Tudor, when you get back, he's going to be like,

06:19.680 --> 06:27.360
well, thank you for your 24 hour long shift, but I see here that you spent $17 on lunch. You're fired.

06:27.360 --> 06:32.720
How good do you think that burger was though? Oh boy. I bet it had some blue cheese on it.

06:32.720 --> 06:37.520
Let's all theory craft what that burger was like because I'm imagining pure,

06:39.040 --> 06:45.600
what's it called when they feed cows lobster and it butters up their fat meats.

06:45.600 --> 06:48.160
It's when you make butter cow. Butter cow, butter beef.

06:48.160 --> 06:52.080
Yeah, I bet it was pure fat Angus butter beef patty.

06:52.080 --> 06:55.680
And then you got to have that apple wood. Isn't Angus butter beef the kid on Two

06:55.680 --> 07:02.960
and a Half Men? You know, I hear he's super Christian now. They always have apple wood

07:02.960 --> 07:08.320
smoked baked. I don't know what apple wood is. It's where you take a piece of wood and you

07:09.200 --> 07:15.600
put an apple on it. And then they use that, they just burn that. Well, they take the apple out

07:15.600 --> 07:21.520
first. It's wood that has been touched by an apple. Okay. That doesn't make much sense,

07:21.520 --> 07:25.840
but I mean, I'm not culinary. Touched by an apple is my favorite TV show.

07:25.840 --> 07:31.200
And it's all about like people whose lives are being ruined by sin. And then like an

07:31.200 --> 07:37.200
apple shows up on the door, but it's completely stationary and doesn't talk or give out blessings

07:37.200 --> 07:41.760
or anything. It just really makes them think. Like it makes them pause.

07:41.760 --> 07:44.800
Who put this fucking apple here? I'm going to turn things around.

07:45.360 --> 07:49.360
It's actually closer to early edition than it is Touched by an Angel because it's like

07:49.360 --> 07:53.200
the apple appears and it's like, oh shit, if there's apples here, I got to save that

07:53.200 --> 07:58.400
busload of kids tomorrow. That does not sound like a good show. What you guys are describing

07:58.400 --> 08:03.600
sounds like an unenjoyable program. It only went about 10 episodes. It was on after a revolution.

08:04.880 --> 08:08.640
I don't want to think about how much you spend anymore. I'm bored of thinking about it.

08:08.640 --> 08:11.440
I think you're fine. I think that you put in an extraordinary effort.

08:11.440 --> 08:16.320
You're fine. Stop worrying. Your boss was trying to alleviate his guilt. That's the only reason

08:16.320 --> 08:22.880
anybody does anything. Yeah. So you did him a favor by spending, getting something juicy

08:22.880 --> 08:27.600
at night. I think it's not like outlandish. It's not like you spent $50 on lunch steak.

08:29.680 --> 08:35.040
You live in a very expensive city and you got some food that costs a good amount of money.

08:35.040 --> 08:41.840
If your boss didn't like it, maybe you should let you not work for 24 hours straight and violate

08:41.840 --> 08:44.160
OSHA regulations. Maybe he shouldn't have done that.

08:44.160 --> 08:47.840
Maybe he should have just let you go home and sleep.

08:47.840 --> 08:54.160
Just let you sleep. You're so tired. How does anybody stay up for 24 hours?

08:54.160 --> 08:57.920
I don't think I'm capable of staying up for longer than 12 and this person did double that.

08:59.120 --> 09:05.680
My boss at the speed factory. This is from Walter White.

09:08.560 --> 09:11.760
I don't want to talk about this question anymore. Okay. It's really bumming you out,

09:11.760 --> 09:16.640
isn't it? Is it because it's bringing you back to your Halcyon retail days?

09:17.360 --> 09:20.960
Yeah. It's just like 24 hours is such a long time to do anything.

09:21.520 --> 09:28.000
There's nothing I want to do for 24 hours, ever. And this guy had to work at a retail

09:28.000 --> 09:31.920
job. It's just bumming me out. You should have used that credit card to buy yourself a plane

09:31.920 --> 09:38.880
to Jamaica. I had a girl once and all she wanted to do was party all 24 hours.

09:38.880 --> 09:40.800
Party all the time.

09:40.800 --> 09:45.120
And so I guess Eddie Murphy wrote a song about it. Anyway, let's go on.

09:45.680 --> 09:47.600
I'm not feeling very funny today, guys. I don't know what's happening to me.

09:47.600 --> 09:51.360
Me neither. We could just try and do a really serious episode where you get

09:51.360 --> 09:54.400
out really heavy. Just like real shit?

09:54.400 --> 09:57.120
Yeah. It gets so deep. Deep and dirty.

09:57.840 --> 10:00.000
Maybe a Yahoo would like, maybe we can say something funny about it.

10:00.000 --> 10:04.480
I don't have any good ones of those either. Ah, shit. This is going to be a Dudsky.

10:04.480 --> 10:11.040
This Yahoo was sent in by Emily Wall. Thank you, Emily. It's by Yahoo Answers user Tom, who asks,

10:13.200 --> 10:18.160
Do ghosts appreciate it if you leave them a little snack on the countertop?

10:18.160 --> 10:22.240
Not like health food or vegetables or anything.

10:23.200 --> 10:27.280
But you know, like a tasty snack, like Oreos or leftover dessert.

10:27.280 --> 10:30.480
If you do this, would they actually eat it? And if they did,

10:30.480 --> 10:34.880
then couldn't you show your proof to scientists that they are real wildlife?

10:34.880 --> 10:37.520
Jesus Christ. That was a toughie.

10:39.200 --> 10:43.120
Wouldn't it be great if like the only reason we have yet to prove the existence of ghosts

10:43.120 --> 10:45.360
is because no one thought to leave them some cookies?

10:45.360 --> 10:47.840
Yeah, that's true. Well, is that really what a ghost would be into?

10:48.800 --> 10:52.240
No, because as we've all seen in Casper the Friendly Ghost,

10:52.240 --> 10:54.560
they eat it and it's just going to fall out their bottoms.

10:55.840 --> 10:58.880
Which begs the question, how do they even eat it in the first place?

10:58.880 --> 11:02.240
Think about that. Think about that scientist who'd write up Casper.

11:02.240 --> 11:04.080
If he can eat it with his mouth in his stomach,

11:04.080 --> 11:06.160
should be also tangible to contain it.

11:06.160 --> 11:09.280
Just some food for fucking thought, Casper writers.

11:09.280 --> 11:11.680
Do you think Casper employed, you know how

11:13.120 --> 11:17.760
sometimes military video games will employ a, you know,

11:18.560 --> 11:23.440
some special ops guys to like confirm what they're doing is accurate.

11:23.440 --> 11:26.000
Do you think the producers and directors of Casper

11:26.000 --> 11:29.120
were enlisted some paranormal experts that could give that,

11:29.120 --> 11:33.440
that could check the accuracy of some of the things in the film?

11:33.440 --> 11:33.920
Clearly not.

11:33.920 --> 11:38.720
I thought you're going to ask if maybe they employed like some ghosts to fact check for them.

11:38.720 --> 11:40.320
I think they aren't real.

11:40.960 --> 11:41.520
Here's the thing.

11:43.200 --> 11:45.120
If a ghost ate a sandwich with his mouth,

11:46.160 --> 11:48.000
then it would stay in his tummy, right?

11:48.000 --> 11:49.040
Can we all agree on that?

11:49.040 --> 11:52.400
If we're going to agree on anything about ghosts and I, of course, they're not real.

11:52.400 --> 11:56.880
You're saying if he had the physical capability to chew and swallow,

11:56.880 --> 11:58.320
if those mechanisms are working.

11:58.320 --> 12:01.760
Okay, so if we're agreeing, then it's like an if A then B situation.

12:01.760 --> 12:04.640
If the ghost is able to pick up the sandwich,

12:04.640 --> 12:06.640
Chew the sandwich, swallow the sandwich.

12:06.640 --> 12:10.560
Then he has the mechanism to digest and then poop the sandwich.

12:10.560 --> 12:14.400
If the ghost is unable to interact with the corporeal sandwich,

12:15.920 --> 12:16.880
then of course.

12:16.880 --> 12:20.160
Oh my God, okay, so let's use ghost logic.

12:20.160 --> 12:24.160
So let's use ghost logic and by ghost logic, I mean the movie ghost.

12:24.160 --> 12:26.880
Because then when he finds himself in the heat of a terrible passion,

12:26.880 --> 12:31.040
he can become part of our extant world.

12:31.040 --> 12:32.640
You know, he can become tangible.

12:32.640 --> 12:34.480
So here's the scenario.

12:34.480 --> 12:41.760
Casper gets really, really angry about Obama taking away his guns or something like that.

12:41.760 --> 12:46.320
And so in that moment of passion, he eats.

12:46.320 --> 12:49.840
Casper the friendly but very conservative ghost.

12:49.840 --> 12:50.640
Yeah, he eats.

12:50.640 --> 12:53.520
Well, he's the ghost of Richie Rich, right?

12:53.520 --> 12:55.840
And Richie Rich is obviously a one person ghost.

12:55.840 --> 12:58.160
That's never been clear to me, but I think that's the case.

12:58.160 --> 12:59.280
Yeah, that is obviously the case.

12:59.280 --> 13:04.720
So in the heat of a terrible passion, Obama, then let's see the birth certificate.

13:04.720 --> 13:06.320
And he gets really angry.

13:06.320 --> 13:09.200
And in the heat of that terrible passion, he eats an Angus butter beef burger.

13:10.480 --> 13:14.880
But then he eats it and then he cools down a little bit.

13:14.880 --> 13:23.360
And in that moment of, you know, of chilling, of cold lamping, the burger falls.

13:23.360 --> 13:24.560
So he's anger eating.

13:25.360 --> 13:27.920
See, I would then I would think that the burger, though,

13:27.920 --> 13:32.800
would then make the transition back to the like astral spectral plane with him.

13:35.760 --> 13:38.560
Well, that doesn't make much sense to me, Travis,

13:38.560 --> 13:44.080
because then if like he got angry about Obama, then for immigrants,

13:44.080 --> 13:47.760
then like he could like grab someone's hand and then like chill on it.

13:47.760 --> 13:51.840
And then like, would that person come with them to go to the Ghost Land Observatory?

13:52.400 --> 13:56.080
Do you think that if Casper wants to eat a full meal, he has to like,

13:56.720 --> 14:02.480
he has to watch Religious and just watch the whole thing and get angry and angry and angry at Bill Maher

14:02.480 --> 14:05.440
and then and then he can finish his dinner?

14:05.440 --> 14:06.080
He just looks.

14:06.080 --> 14:10.080
Even then, though, even then, he is still translucent.

14:10.080 --> 14:14.720
So like, even if he managed to stay angry for the 12 hours, it would take

14:14.720 --> 14:17.440
for his food to fully digest and be expelled.

14:18.720 --> 14:20.960
Like you would see it turn to poopy.

14:20.960 --> 14:23.920
That's something I was worried about with Slim Goodbody.

14:23.920 --> 14:27.680
What if he had a recording right after lunch and the kids just had to

14:27.680 --> 14:32.640
like watch in horror as his Reuben and egg cream turned into poopy?

14:33.760 --> 14:37.200
Well, there's a lot of there's Justin, you are opening up a pretty huge,

14:37.200 --> 14:40.560
a pretty huge door here for horrific, horrific things

14:40.560 --> 14:42.800
that you could see Slim Goodbody doing through his skin.

14:42.800 --> 14:47.600
What if the kids knew Slim Goodbody had lung cancer before Slim Goodbody's doctors did?

14:47.600 --> 14:48.480
That's what I'm saying, they saw a mouse.

14:48.480 --> 14:54.080
Uh, Slim, Slim, Mr. Goodbody, can you, I'm worried about,

14:54.080 --> 14:56.240
I'm not sure that's just a cold Mr. Goodbody.

14:57.840 --> 15:00.480
It looks like you got a tapeworm, Mr. Goodbody.

15:00.480 --> 15:04.000
Mr. Goodbody, your clothes seem to be fitting you really loosely,

15:04.000 --> 15:08.400
which is weird because your clothes are that you don't have skin.

15:08.400 --> 15:11.200
So I don't know how that's working, but you look a little haggard.

15:12.240 --> 15:15.920
What's sadder than a guy with no skin wearing a terrycloth robe?

15:15.920 --> 15:16.560
Nothing.

15:16.560 --> 15:18.800
Hey bro, cool epididymis.

15:18.800 --> 15:19.760
I can see it.

15:19.760 --> 15:20.880
I can see all of it.

15:20.880 --> 15:21.520
The coils.

15:22.480 --> 15:23.760
Is that Slim?

15:23.760 --> 15:27.360
Is that a balloon of cocaine in your rectum?

15:27.360 --> 15:29.200
Wait, is Slim Goodbody a ghost?

15:30.320 --> 15:31.120
What?

15:31.120 --> 15:32.400
No, he's half ghost.

15:32.400 --> 15:34.720
He's sure as fuck not alive.

15:34.720 --> 15:35.920
He's got skin ghost.

15:35.920 --> 15:38.960
You don't get to be vivisected and get to keep on being alive.

15:38.960 --> 15:39.600
That's not a thing that keeps-

15:39.600 --> 15:42.160
I think if that show were to take place in the real world,

15:42.160 --> 15:44.800
it would just be a series of Slim Goodbody screaming

15:44.800 --> 15:46.240
because he had been flayed alive.

15:46.240 --> 15:48.080
Oh, it'd be a Saw movie, sure.

15:48.080 --> 15:50.800
He's still doing the show well into his 60s,

15:50.800 --> 15:54.160
but they keep having to redraw to make his prostate bigger.

15:56.480 --> 15:58.160
No, larger than that, trust me.

15:59.200 --> 16:00.480
And get my hemorrhoids.

16:00.480 --> 16:03.520
Oh man, what a bummer this episode is.

16:03.520 --> 16:05.040
What a bummer Slim Goodbody is.

16:06.160 --> 16:08.160
Fucking Candle Knights is next week.

16:08.160 --> 16:11.920
I guess we are just lowering the base level of where everybody's at

16:11.920 --> 16:13.920
so that we can bring them right back up with Candle Knights.

16:13.920 --> 16:17.040
This time of year, everyone's a little bit disappointed.

16:17.040 --> 16:17.760
Yeah, it's true.

16:17.760 --> 16:20.320
Just remember next week, we're not going to talk about prostates at all.

16:20.880 --> 16:23.120
My boyfriend recently purchased an iPad.

16:23.120 --> 16:27.040
We love the convenient technology of being able to look at internet memes whenever we like,

16:27.040 --> 16:33.680
but lately he has been browsing on the pad until the wee hours of the night right next to me in bed.

16:33.680 --> 16:36.720
I miss the end of the day conversation and cuddle time we used to share.

16:36.720 --> 16:39.600
Is it rude to request him to limit his nighttime screen time?

16:39.600 --> 16:40.880
He seems to think so.

16:40.880 --> 16:43.200
That's from iPad replaced in Portland.

16:46.240 --> 16:48.240
This is such a sad thing in the modern age.

16:49.040 --> 16:50.240
But it's everything.

16:50.240 --> 16:52.320
It's everything and everywhere now.

16:52.320 --> 16:57.120
You know, there are nights I got Teresa an iPod Touch for her birthday.

16:57.120 --> 17:03.440
There are nights now, you know, we just sit there and I'm on my iPhone and she's on her iPad or iPod.

17:03.440 --> 17:08.560
And we remember the times when we used to just like talk to each other and enjoy each other's company.

17:08.560 --> 17:09.600
Those times are dead now.

17:10.960 --> 17:15.600
I do not think it is wrong of you to want boundaries.

17:16.800 --> 17:19.360
I think that laying that out and saying like,

17:19.360 --> 17:27.520
hey, I would really prefer that this be a time where we could like talk to each other and bond.

17:27.520 --> 17:29.680
I don't think that that's inappropriate at all.

17:29.680 --> 17:30.640
I mean, I think that it's...

17:31.600 --> 17:35.200
I think what is maybe making this hard for you is that you feel like you shouldn't have to ask,

17:35.200 --> 17:40.240
why does he not want to talk with you instead of get on the iPad?

17:40.240 --> 17:46.240
And here's the truth, ladies and gentlemen, no one is as interesting as an iPad.

17:46.240 --> 17:47.600
I don't want that kind of pressure.

17:47.600 --> 17:49.920
That's true. I don't want to have to compete with that.

17:49.920 --> 17:53.520
Well, hold on, because I have a multitude of apps, you know?

17:54.480 --> 17:55.200
Sure, you got some apps.

17:55.200 --> 17:57.440
I make coffee in the morning, that's an app.

17:59.680 --> 18:03.040
If there's a bug, then sometimes I can do something about it.

18:03.040 --> 18:04.960
That's kind of an app, if you think about it.

18:04.960 --> 18:06.400
There's an app, that's true.

18:08.320 --> 18:13.920
I can go to sleep in the middle of the day pretty much anytime so that there's an app.

18:13.920 --> 18:16.080
I mean, I'm not saying you don't have utility, Griffin.

18:16.080 --> 18:19.440
I'm saying that if someone says to me,

18:19.440 --> 18:23.200
hey, here's a wall of information and games and fun,

18:23.200 --> 18:25.840
and over here is someone who wants to tell you about their dogs.

18:25.840 --> 18:30.080
I've got little hands so I can get inside of wine glasses and clean them out.

18:30.080 --> 18:31.760
Okay, so you're like Ratatouille, basically.

18:31.760 --> 18:32.560
That's another app.

18:32.560 --> 18:34.720
That's what you got.

18:34.720 --> 18:37.280
That's it. Shit, that's everything I can do.

18:37.280 --> 18:38.240
I know, this is what I'm saying.

18:38.240 --> 18:38.640
God damn it.

18:38.640 --> 18:40.160
That wouldn't fill up the home screen.

18:40.160 --> 18:40.800
Yeah, that's true.

18:41.920 --> 18:42.560
Nobody wants to competition.

18:42.560 --> 18:44.400
Do you know everyone who's been in every movie ever,

18:44.400 --> 18:46.400
what year they came out and how much they grossed?

18:50.160 --> 18:52.240
Sometimes I throw shit at birds.

18:54.320 --> 18:58.160
Well, that's just kind of a mean thing that you do.

18:58.160 --> 18:59.120
I slice fruit up.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.680
Oh, yeah? That's pretty good.

19:01.680 --> 19:02.720
There's not an app for that.

19:03.520 --> 19:04.880
How about an iPad? What you got?

19:09.920 --> 19:11.920
I have a piano that doesn't work,

19:11.920 --> 19:14.960
but when I press the keys on it, I make fart noises with my mouth.

19:14.960 --> 19:15.920
So there's another app.

19:18.240 --> 19:21.440
I can basically make fart noises anytime, whatever you want.

19:21.440 --> 19:25.760
On command, tone, length, frequency.

19:25.760 --> 19:26.560
There's an app.

19:26.560 --> 19:27.360
There's another one.

19:28.720 --> 19:32.720
That one was fart noise with his mouth that could actually get you a free phone call

19:32.720 --> 19:33.840
if you put it into a payphone.

19:33.840 --> 19:34.640
That app is free.

19:35.360 --> 19:36.080
That's a free app.

19:36.080 --> 19:36.720
That's a free app.

19:36.720 --> 19:37.360
You can just get that.

19:37.360 --> 19:38.080
That's no problem.

19:38.080 --> 19:41.920
Um, I can't tell you all the recipes, but I know like six.

19:42.640 --> 19:43.760
I know spaghetti.

19:43.760 --> 19:44.400
There's an app.

19:46.480 --> 19:48.480
I can make muffins if I got the mix of milk.

19:48.480 --> 19:49.680
So there's another app.

19:49.680 --> 19:50.640
Just count all the apps.

19:50.640 --> 19:51.280
That's what I'm saying.

19:52.640 --> 19:57.920
You have to, it's just like Jonathan Winters said in Rent.

20:01.120 --> 20:03.840
Measure your life in apps.

20:03.840 --> 20:07.040
And if you can't, you are competing with all the technology

20:07.040 --> 20:08.800
that your boyfriend now loves more than you.

20:09.360 --> 20:12.640
So like you've got a Jolene situation on your hands.

20:12.640 --> 20:15.600
Only instead of a woman with flaming locks of auburn hair,

20:15.600 --> 20:17.920
you are dealing with an iPad.

20:17.920 --> 20:19.680
You've been Jolene, madam.

20:19.680 --> 20:20.640
You got Jolene.

20:20.640 --> 20:22.240
You've been iJolene.

20:22.240 --> 20:23.200
You've been iJolene.

20:23.200 --> 20:26.480
Seriously, it's coming at us all on all sides.

20:26.480 --> 20:30.720
And if you can't download more apps to compete, then you're fucked.

20:30.720 --> 20:31.600
You're going to lose them.

20:31.600 --> 20:38.720
You, we all have to take little stands against this battle versus the robots.

20:38.720 --> 20:43.680
And this battle to keep connected isn't like competing for attention normally

20:43.680 --> 20:45.200
because nobody can compete with it.

20:45.840 --> 20:51.200
We just have to use our superior human willpower before they get willpower soon.

20:51.200 --> 20:51.760
Right.

20:51.760 --> 20:53.040
You just got to find your strengths.

20:53.040 --> 20:55.840
My GF will get deep into a game of chip chain, right?

20:56.480 --> 21:00.320
She'll get real deep into some cut the rope.

21:00.320 --> 21:03.440
And then, you know what, I have to stand up there and maybe I do like a little dance.

21:04.400 --> 21:06.400
That's not something that the iPad can provide.

21:06.400 --> 21:10.640
Unless you get on YouTube and you search for like a better dance than I do,

21:10.640 --> 21:13.040
which is going to be hard to find.

21:14.640 --> 21:15.360
Yeah.

21:15.360 --> 21:16.320
You're going to be looking for a while.

21:16.320 --> 21:17.040
Let's just put it that way.

21:17.040 --> 21:17.440
Yeah.

21:17.440 --> 21:18.960
Good luck searching for the right terms.

21:19.920 --> 21:21.600
Tell him you got to be direct.

21:21.600 --> 21:24.240
Say, listen, I miss the time we used to spend together.

21:24.240 --> 21:25.120
He'll respect that.

21:26.080 --> 21:26.720
He'll promise.

21:26.720 --> 21:27.520
He will.

21:27.520 --> 21:30.400
And if he doesn't respect it, snap it over your knee.

21:30.400 --> 21:31.280
Oh, don't do that.

21:32.000 --> 21:37.040
Snap it over your knee and get your relationship back.

21:37.040 --> 21:38.160
No, Justin.

21:38.160 --> 21:41.280
You got to put it in a position so he breaks it.

21:41.280 --> 21:41.520
Yeah.

21:41.520 --> 21:42.160
Okay.

21:42.160 --> 21:47.760
So on the floor, you looking at it late at night, you leave it on his chest so that when

21:47.760 --> 21:50.320
he wakes up, he drops it off the side of the bed.

21:51.120 --> 21:51.600
Why?

21:51.600 --> 21:52.800
What do you think they're made of?

21:54.480 --> 21:54.980
Glass?

21:55.840 --> 21:56.240
Candy?

21:56.240 --> 21:56.800
Sugar?

21:56.800 --> 21:58.800
I mean, they are made out of a kind of glass.

21:59.440 --> 21:59.600
Yeah.

21:59.600 --> 22:00.880
They're made out of glass and metal.

22:00.880 --> 22:05.040
I just don't think it's going to break if you throw one off your chest in the middle of the night.

22:05.040 --> 22:05.600
And I do think the-

22:05.600 --> 22:07.920
I've broken seven iPhones.

22:07.920 --> 22:09.120
Well, dad broke one of them.

22:09.120 --> 22:10.720
Dad broke one of them for you.

22:10.720 --> 22:13.040
I have had indirectly broken.

22:13.040 --> 22:13.520
Yes.

22:14.080 --> 22:16.800
You have been the owner of several broken iProducts.

22:18.000 --> 22:18.240
Yeah.

22:18.240 --> 22:19.120
It's easy.

22:19.120 --> 22:23.360
I think you're planning to work, Travis, but I think you got to get the iPad like halfway there.

22:23.360 --> 22:29.200
I think maybe you step on it a few times and then you put it on his chest.

22:29.200 --> 22:32.160
I stepped on this and apparently my size six pumps.

22:33.360 --> 22:35.680
Why does it say kids backwards on my broken iPad?

22:38.000 --> 22:40.400
This podcast and the last podcast are by kids.

22:43.920 --> 22:46.160
An attractive friend of mine lives out of state.

22:47.760 --> 22:49.040
Why are you yelling?

22:49.040 --> 22:53.040
I don't know, but he's coming to my college graduation in about a month.

22:53.040 --> 22:55.440
A few days ago, she texts me to say that she is drunk.

22:56.080 --> 22:59.440
She's up for having sex with me when she's here for my graduation.

23:00.640 --> 23:04.080
Being that she was drunk when she sent these text messages,

23:04.080 --> 23:06.160
what should my expectations be when I see her?

23:06.880 --> 23:10.800
Is there a way I can tastefully bring up this topic again in the meantime

23:10.800 --> 23:13.200
to see if the offer still stands when she is sober?

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
Missouri loves company.

23:16.560 --> 23:18.320
The answer is no.

23:19.920 --> 23:21.840
Absolutely not.

23:21.840 --> 23:24.560
You're actually asking the way wrong question.

23:24.560 --> 23:26.400
In vino veritas, you know?

23:26.400 --> 23:26.880
No, no, no.

23:27.840 --> 23:28.720
Here's the thing.

23:28.720 --> 23:32.720
It doesn't matter because I would actually posit that probably what it was

23:32.720 --> 23:36.480
is she wasn't really that drunk, but she wanted to be drunker than she was

23:36.480 --> 23:38.400
to bring up the fact that she wanted to have sex with you

23:38.400 --> 23:39.840
when she came to visit your school.

23:40.720 --> 23:41.680
She's into it.

23:41.680 --> 23:45.520
But the problem is she gave you too much forewarning.

23:45.520 --> 23:48.720
It's going to hang in the air for a fucking month now.

23:48.720 --> 23:52.000
You taste that it's like some sexual discomfort in the room

23:52.000 --> 23:55.600
because it's not going to be casual and easy when she rolls up in town.

23:55.600 --> 23:58.880
It's not going to be like, oh, we had such a good time at dinner and things led

23:58.880 --> 24:03.440
like you're both can be sitting there like so in your heads the whole fucking time.

24:04.560 --> 24:06.160
And it's going to be the fucking time.

24:06.160 --> 24:08.480
Yeah, you're not going to.

24:08.480 --> 24:11.680
You're not going to enjoy her visit at all because every time it's like,

24:11.680 --> 24:15.520
well, I guess we should head home, yawn, let's go.

24:15.520 --> 24:20.880
Oh, can we fucking get breathalyzers put on all of our goddamn phones

24:20.880 --> 24:25.520
and not so that when you get drunk, you don't text people things that you regret

24:25.520 --> 24:26.240
because guess what?

24:26.240 --> 24:28.320
That never actually happens in real life.

24:28.960 --> 24:32.320
But just so that you don't text people things that you want to tell them,

24:32.320 --> 24:35.760
but under any other circumstance wouldn't be OK,

24:35.760 --> 24:37.360
except that you've had a few drinks now.

24:37.360 --> 24:38.400
And so it's really cool.

24:38.960 --> 24:43.120
Well, OK, I actually need to take umbrage with your first point, Griffin.

24:43.120 --> 24:48.640
Two nights ago I had had a bunch of wine and I got on Twitter

24:48.640 --> 24:52.800
and told people to vote for their favorite between rap music,

24:52.800 --> 24:56.000
Lady Gaga, pizza and ribbon candy.

24:56.000 --> 24:56.720
Right.

24:56.720 --> 24:59.920
So but let's let's let's get real one.

24:59.920 --> 25:01.520
Of course, pizza one.

25:01.520 --> 25:05.040
Um, wait, pizza be all of rap music.

25:08.320 --> 25:10.640
To be fair, the only vote I counted was my own.

25:10.640 --> 25:14.160
OK, that's a thing that you would normally say, though.

25:14.960 --> 25:15.440
That's it.

25:15.440 --> 25:16.000
That's it.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.880
I feel like that is a standard Justin Bonemont.

25:18.880 --> 25:21.200
If you had gotten on there and then said, like,

25:21.200 --> 25:24.720
drop some real racist shit about like Pacific Islanders,

25:24.720 --> 25:27.840
then that would that would have been slightly out of character because you.

25:27.840 --> 25:28.640
Samoa?

25:28.640 --> 25:29.680
No moa.

25:29.680 --> 25:30.400
Thank you.

25:30.400 --> 25:32.560
Tongan, Tongan, Tongan.

25:32.560 --> 25:40.880
So the Filipino, Filipino.

25:40.880 --> 25:41.920
That would have been bad.

25:41.920 --> 25:43.360
But that's not what you did.

25:43.360 --> 25:48.480
Well, what I'm the ish is the people who who have like three sips of a smear

25:48.480 --> 25:51.120
and off ice and then call up their best friends since childhood

25:51.120 --> 25:55.200
and talk about, you know, how much they want to jump on the tip.

25:56.640 --> 25:58.720
It drives me absolutely fucking bonkers,

25:58.720 --> 26:03.120
and I'm glad that I don't have to deal with it as much in like my 25 year old life

26:03.120 --> 26:04.720
as I did in my 21 year old life.

26:05.760 --> 26:10.160
I think that you should just let things happen naturally.

26:10.880 --> 26:12.000
She was drinking.

26:12.560 --> 26:14.640
You were at a guy.

26:15.840 --> 26:17.840
So that is your excuse there.

26:17.840 --> 26:18.480
You were there.

26:20.800 --> 26:21.120
I mean.

26:22.320 --> 26:25.760
Is it possible she meant to send it to somebody like your name is Kylo

26:25.760 --> 26:28.640
and she meant to send it to Kyle?

26:28.640 --> 26:29.440
Is that possible?

26:30.320 --> 26:31.360
Maybe she pressed the wrong button.

26:31.360 --> 26:33.600
Did I send this to Kylo or Kyle?

26:33.600 --> 26:34.160
Oh, fuck.

26:34.160 --> 26:36.000
I sent this to Steven or Sreven.

26:37.760 --> 26:39.200
Happy graduation, Sreven.

26:41.680 --> 26:42.560
I'm so proud of you.

26:43.520 --> 26:45.200
Just be a cool cat there.

26:45.200 --> 26:48.240
OK, I can confirm one thing definitively.

26:48.240 --> 26:55.360
There is absolutely no way for you to text her

26:55.360 --> 26:59.120
and say, so remember earlier when sex?

27:00.880 --> 27:03.120
They were still penciled in for sex on your business, correct?

27:03.120 --> 27:05.680
Is that gonna happen, please?

27:05.680 --> 27:07.360
Hey, just getting.

27:07.360 --> 27:09.040
I need time to get my wiener ready.

27:09.040 --> 27:12.000
So let me know if this is still in the cards.

27:12.000 --> 27:12.320
What's that?

27:12.320 --> 27:15.760
I don't want to do the thing that I do by myself

27:15.760 --> 27:21.200
if I'm going to do that with someone else that day or soon.

27:22.480 --> 27:23.520
So write me back.

27:23.520 --> 27:26.800
Please, sincerely, Sreven at yahoo.com.

27:28.320 --> 27:30.960
I would say that the best course of action

27:30.960 --> 27:33.600
is to just assume that you're not going to have sex

27:33.600 --> 27:35.360
and it's never going to come up again

27:35.360 --> 27:37.600
and that that was just a mistake and ignore it.

27:37.600 --> 27:40.320
So then when it happens, it's awesome and spontaneous

27:40.320 --> 27:41.040
and great.

27:41.040 --> 27:43.440
But if it doesn't happen, you're not sitting there

27:43.440 --> 27:47.600
the whole time like, so should I put my arm around her shoulder

27:47.600 --> 27:48.720
or try to kiss her?

27:48.720 --> 27:50.960
Don't put that on yourself.

27:51.520 --> 27:52.960
God, really, this fucking sucks.

27:52.960 --> 27:56.320
Please, nobody ever goddamn do this.

27:56.320 --> 27:57.280
It's so hard.

27:57.280 --> 28:01.040
It's so hard walking the social and sexual minefield

28:01.040 --> 28:02.240
that is your 20s.

28:02.880 --> 28:06.560
Can we not complicate things by sending people cryptic messages

28:06.560 --> 28:11.200
that may or may not, if they can figure out the wind talking

28:11.200 --> 28:13.440
that you just dropped on them, maybe they'll get fucked?

28:13.440 --> 28:15.200
Like, can we please not do that?

28:15.200 --> 28:18.480
Why wouldn't you just wait till you go visit Sreven

28:18.480 --> 28:19.920
and then just have sex with him?

28:19.920 --> 28:20.160
Yeah.

28:20.160 --> 28:22.880
Like, why ruin the end of the book?

28:22.880 --> 28:24.160
Why are you giving them a trailer?

28:25.520 --> 28:27.200
Spoiler alert, Sreven.

28:27.200 --> 28:28.240
I'm going to fuck you.

28:28.240 --> 28:31.040
I can't adults just have sex like the normal thing

28:31.040 --> 28:33.840
and not make a fucking marketing campaign for it?

28:36.080 --> 28:38.320
Hashtag fucking Sreven tonight.

28:40.880 --> 28:42.960
Retweet, get this up on your social.

28:42.960 --> 28:44.560
We're going to hit all of our key beats.

28:44.560 --> 28:47.680
Did you RSVP the Facebook group for me and Sreven fucking?

28:47.680 --> 28:51.120
We're going to get this narrative really moving forward.

28:51.760 --> 28:54.800
Hashtag gonna make a magnet come loud.

28:58.240 --> 29:01.200
We're exploiting guerrilla marketing, which don't ask.

29:01.200 --> 29:02.640
It is highly dangerous.

29:03.440 --> 29:04.480
You need to get a fucking guerrilla.

29:06.160 --> 29:06.960
That's what I meant.

29:06.960 --> 29:18.560
Money zone.

29:18.560 --> 29:21.120
If you'd like to fucking guerrilla, you gotta be safe.

29:22.080 --> 29:25.280
And the only way to do that is to go to extremistraights.com

29:25.280 --> 29:28.240
and get one of their many, many, many, many, many

29:28.240 --> 29:31.440
guerrilla tranquilizers that will let you make love

29:31.440 --> 29:33.360
to all sorts of exotic animals.

29:33.360 --> 29:34.960
It doesn't have to be a guerrilla.

29:34.960 --> 29:40.880
You know, maybe you want to get a

29:42.160 --> 29:45.440
Prince Albert chastity device for $89.95

29:46.000 --> 29:48.800
and then you want to fuck a giraffe with it.

29:48.800 --> 29:49.840
Well, that's fine.

29:49.840 --> 29:51.040
You can just give the draft some.

29:51.680 --> 29:52.000
Okay.

29:52.000 --> 29:56.160
I do want to say I'm sorry the tranquilizers are not actually

29:56.160 --> 30:00.880
on there, but the metal ring that goes around your penises.

30:00.880 --> 30:05.520
I don't think you're allowed to fuck like zoo animals at the zoo.

30:05.520 --> 30:10.640
I think if you go to the zoo, they don't let you just go hog wild.

30:10.640 --> 30:11.600
Listen, listen.

30:11.600 --> 30:13.920
They don't advertise that, Griffin.

30:13.920 --> 30:15.280
It's not an average.

30:15.280 --> 30:18.480
You know, there's a secret club in Disneyland that's only for-

30:18.480 --> 30:19.280
Yeah, you trade-

30:19.280 --> 30:20.960
It was like club 11 or something.

30:20.960 --> 30:22.560
Club 30, 35.

30:22.560 --> 30:23.760
I trade pins, right?

30:23.760 --> 30:28.960
You trade pins, but at the zoo, you trade cock rings with-

30:28.960 --> 30:33.840
Well, at extremerestraints.com, you trade money for something to fuck

30:33.840 --> 30:36.720
and they've got everything you could want.

30:36.720 --> 30:42.000
If you want to put a dick on a lady, they can do that for you for a very reasonable price.

30:42.000 --> 30:44.800
Justin, this is a season to be sharing.

30:44.800 --> 30:45.200
That's true.

30:45.200 --> 30:47.840
So this is a time to buy something for your lover.

30:48.640 --> 30:50.720
Maybe something to please your lover.

30:50.720 --> 30:52.480
Can you get a second dick for you?

30:53.040 --> 30:54.720
Like you can have two dicks on it.

30:55.280 --> 30:56.400
Here's what I'm going to tell you.

30:56.400 --> 31:00.000
I'm looking at it right now and the answer is yes.

31:00.000 --> 31:00.320
All right.

31:00.320 --> 31:06.000
With the Fetish Fantasy Hollow strap on, you can have sex,

31:07.840 --> 31:16.720
do the thing that you do at the inn for guys, and then put this on and you're ready for round two.

31:16.720 --> 31:17.920
You get a dick for your dick?

31:18.720 --> 31:24.000
It's a prosthetic dick to replace the dick that doesn't work no more because it felt too good.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.040
We heard you like dicks.

31:25.040 --> 31:27.600
So we got you a dick for your dick so you can dick while you're dicking.

31:27.600 --> 31:30.320
I don't think you put it, yes, no, correction.

31:30.320 --> 31:31.280
It is hollow.

31:31.280 --> 31:36.000
It is designed to put your dick in to give it a little relaxation.

31:36.560 --> 31:40.240
How fucking deep does that Matryoshka doll go?

31:40.240 --> 31:43.200
Can you keep putting dicks on the dicks on the dicks on the dicks forever?

31:43.200 --> 31:43.440
I think so.

31:43.440 --> 31:45.280
I put a dick on your dick, on your dick, on your dick, on your dick.

31:45.280 --> 31:45.840
Oh God.

31:45.840 --> 31:49.280
It's basically like the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers of dicks.

31:49.280 --> 31:53.840
Like it's Morphin Time and your bad broken dick that felt too good.

31:53.840 --> 31:58.080
So it died is replaced by a synthetic dick.

31:58.080 --> 32:03.280
I don't understand what your blue Ranger of dicks and then it becomes like the green Ranger of dicks.

32:03.280 --> 32:11.200
So you can get that for $31.99 except, except with the middlest coupon code,

32:11.200 --> 32:15.840
you're going to save 20% on that and anything you buy at ExtremeRestraints.com.

32:15.840 --> 32:18.640
So get over there, buy something for your lover.

32:18.640 --> 32:25.040
And, and maybe they don't, maybe your lover doesn't want to get fucked with a fake dick.

32:25.040 --> 32:27.760
Maybe they want to have someone read a book to them.

32:27.760 --> 32:28.400
That's cool.

32:28.400 --> 32:49.040
That's cool. We got something for them too.

32:49.040 --> 32:54.400
Guys, we have a very special message from Marco from Gallia who says,

32:54.400 --> 32:58.800
Hey Marco, I hope your birthday is a good one and that you'll dress sharp for your

32:58.800 --> 33:02.160
fancy schmancy birthday dinner, maybe in your new gray suit.

33:02.160 --> 33:04.320
And don't forget to shave your head smooth.

33:04.320 --> 33:06.640
Your friends love you from Gallia and company.

33:07.360 --> 33:11.280
Maybe you should just like let him do his own like stuff.

33:11.280 --> 33:12.880
He wanted to wear his new blue suit.

33:12.880 --> 33:13.280
Yeah.

33:13.280 --> 33:15.120
Let him, let Marco do Marco.

33:15.120 --> 33:18.880
Let Marco, maybe he wants his head to get kind of shaggy and rotten.

33:18.880 --> 33:21.760
And he wants to shave like his basketball number in the back.

33:21.760 --> 33:22.000
Yeah.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.160
It's a whitening bolts.

33:24.160 --> 33:25.440
We got a message for Hudson.

33:27.360 --> 33:28.880
Curie, Curie, Curie.

33:28.880 --> 33:30.000
Let's go with Curie, Curie.

33:31.120 --> 33:33.920
This message is from Cody and he says,

33:33.920 --> 33:35.920
Welcome to the world Hudson.

33:35.920 --> 33:38.080
Your new super friend, Cody is happy to meet you.

33:38.640 --> 33:41.600
By the way, congrats to Chris and Christina.

33:41.600 --> 33:42.640
So this is a baby.

33:42.640 --> 33:43.920
No, you assume it's a baby.

33:43.920 --> 33:45.040
It could be an alien.

33:45.040 --> 33:45.520
No.

33:45.520 --> 33:45.840
Okay.

33:45.840 --> 33:47.040
It might be a more situation.

33:47.040 --> 33:48.480
Welcome to the world.

33:48.480 --> 33:52.000
Welcome to the world.

33:52.000 --> 33:53.440
Guys, this is a little baby.

33:54.240 --> 33:56.480
You don't know that it could also be an alien baby.

33:56.480 --> 33:58.160
And it could be the best of both worlds.

33:58.160 --> 33:58.640
Literally.

34:02.080 --> 34:03.040
It's a funny joke.

34:03.040 --> 34:03.520
Travis.

34:03.520 --> 34:04.880
Glad you said it out loud.

34:04.880 --> 34:06.080
Who's this message for?

34:06.080 --> 34:07.440
The Chowboys.

34:07.440 --> 34:07.760
Yeah.

34:08.480 --> 34:16.000
It's from Ian and Ian says wishing you a very merry

34:16.000 --> 34:19.680
crimbus and a fiscally responsible candlelight.

34:19.680 --> 34:22.080
I hope that you all find rats in your presents.

34:22.080 --> 34:23.200
Merry Dillfmas.

34:23.200 --> 34:29.600
How many holidays is this group of super friends celebrating?

34:30.800 --> 34:33.680
The super friends Chowboys, I think they're celebrating

34:33.680 --> 34:37.280
everything and also have in jokes for every holiday.

34:37.280 --> 34:41.440
The note that are narrow casting, I think is how you would describe.

34:41.440 --> 34:43.600
Because it's easy to read Dillfmas and think,

34:43.600 --> 34:45.440
Oh, it's like the opposite of MILF.

34:45.440 --> 34:46.000
It's a Dillf.

34:46.000 --> 34:46.720
It's a dad.

34:46.720 --> 34:48.320
But really, it's all about Dillf, right?

34:49.120 --> 34:49.920
Oh, God.

34:49.920 --> 34:51.360
The worst holiday.

34:51.360 --> 34:52.320
Thanks, Chowboys.

35:06.480 --> 35:09.280
And not even asked you guys if you just, I don't know.

35:09.280 --> 35:10.560
You're finally getting it in $20.

35:10.560 --> 35:11.280
I don't fucking give a shit.

35:11.280 --> 35:13.680
With just 21 doing it days left.

35:13.680 --> 35:16.400
Um, everyone's gotten it done, right?

35:16.400 --> 35:17.200
Everyone's done it.

35:17.840 --> 35:18.720
This is important.

35:19.600 --> 35:20.720
This clock, she's ticking.

35:20.720 --> 35:21.760
Just ask her, dummy.

35:22.320 --> 35:23.760
This Yahoo was sent in by Ira Ray.

35:23.760 --> 35:24.320
Thank you, Ira.

35:24.320 --> 35:25.600
It's by Yahoo answer's user.

35:25.600 --> 35:26.160
Oh, God.

35:27.520 --> 35:28.640
Now, is this Ira Ray?

35:29.280 --> 35:29.780
Huh?

35:30.400 --> 35:31.360
Is this Ira Ray?

35:31.920 --> 35:32.960
Ira Ray.

35:35.040 --> 35:35.840
Okay, go on.

35:35.840 --> 35:36.720
Who did you think it was?

35:37.840 --> 35:38.400
Jimmy Ray.

35:40.000 --> 35:40.800
Oh, God.

35:40.800 --> 35:43.360
I'm sorry I couldn't alley-oop that for you.

35:43.920 --> 35:44.640
Thanks.

35:44.640 --> 35:45.200
We'll try again.

35:45.200 --> 35:45.440
Okay.

35:46.320 --> 35:48.560
Is that Ira Ray?

35:48.560 --> 35:49.440
Who wants to know?

35:50.240 --> 35:51.520
Is it Sling Blade?

35:54.800 --> 35:55.520
That's not the lyric.

35:55.520 --> 35:56.400
Shut up.

35:56.400 --> 35:57.280
Please shut up.

35:57.280 --> 36:00.000
Please, please, please shut up.

36:00.000 --> 36:03.360
Yahoo answer's user, alcoholism is my new hobby, asks.

36:03.360 --> 36:03.760
Okay.

36:03.760 --> 36:10.640
Does anyone else's spouse do karate in the shower?

36:10.640 --> 36:14.480
I poked my head in the shower and my husband froze immediately in this strange pose.

36:14.480 --> 36:17.200
I asked him what he was doing and he looks at me and he says karate.

36:18.000 --> 36:20.880
Like it's the most normal thing in the world to do karate in the shower.

36:20.880 --> 36:23.120
Anyone else's spouse do weird things in the shower?

36:25.200 --> 36:27.360
Of all the things you could catch your spouse doing,

36:27.360 --> 36:29.520
I wouldn't put karate at the top of the weird list.

36:31.040 --> 36:33.680
By the way, if he's standing in the shower

36:33.680 --> 36:37.760
propping himself up with one hand and jerking his soapy wiener off,

36:37.760 --> 36:39.040
that's not karate guys.

36:39.600 --> 36:41.840
He did not learn that move from Chow Yun Fat.

36:41.840 --> 36:44.000
Guaranteed, guaranteed.

36:44.000 --> 36:45.920
He might've learned it from David Carradine.

36:45.920 --> 36:46.080
Nope.

36:50.800 --> 36:51.360
Oh man.

36:51.360 --> 36:51.920
Oh man.

36:52.480 --> 36:53.440
Oh golly.

36:53.440 --> 36:54.320
Oh good golly.

36:54.320 --> 36:58.560
Um, how, first of all, extremely dangerous.

36:59.520 --> 37:00.560
Super duper dangerous.

37:00.560 --> 37:02.480
Super, the most super.

37:02.480 --> 37:05.760
Unless you have those fish on the bathtub floor.

37:05.760 --> 37:06.240
Oh yeah.

37:06.240 --> 37:07.200
Then you're safe.

37:07.200 --> 37:09.600
Uh, excuse me, Home Depot clerk?

37:09.600 --> 37:10.320
Uh, yes.

37:11.040 --> 37:13.120
I was looking at the plastic bathtub fish.

37:13.120 --> 37:14.720
Are these karate rated?

37:14.720 --> 37:17.360
Are these rated for karate in the bathtub?

37:17.360 --> 37:21.200
When I do a flying sweeping crane kick, how are these going to treat my feet?

37:21.200 --> 37:22.960
Cause I need to simulate-

37:22.960 --> 37:24.240
I've been hurt before.

37:24.240 --> 37:29.680
I need to simulate the natural battlefield flooring, you know?

37:29.680 --> 37:34.320
But if you can learn to karate in the shower though, you can karate anywhere.

37:34.320 --> 37:34.560
Yeah.

37:35.360 --> 37:35.840
Yeah.

37:35.840 --> 37:40.320
It's like how Yoda made Luke Skywalker run around with a Yoda on his back so he could

37:40.320 --> 37:41.120
jump super high.

37:42.080 --> 37:42.640
Wait, what?

37:43.840 --> 37:44.880
In the Star Wars.

37:44.880 --> 37:51.600
Um, I don't think my, I don't think my spouse or my betrothed does karate in the shower.

37:52.160 --> 37:55.680
I don't think, I don't think anybody does weird things in the shower that I know.

37:56.960 --> 37:59.520
My shower is too small to do awesome things in.

37:59.520 --> 38:00.320
Mm-hmm.

38:00.320 --> 38:01.040
I need a bigger shower.

38:01.040 --> 38:05.200
When you guys visit someone who like lives in a big house and they have like a big shower

38:05.200 --> 38:09.040
with like two heads and like maybe there's a chair in there, do you just assume that

38:09.040 --> 38:10.160
they're fucking freaks?

38:12.080 --> 38:16.080
You just assume, maybe that's just me, but if I see somebody who has like gone through

38:16.080 --> 38:19.760
all the effort to like put a big shower in their house, I just assume that they needed

38:19.760 --> 38:24.560
a big shower in which to express themselves sexually on each other in a wet place.

38:25.600 --> 38:25.920
Yeah.

38:25.920 --> 38:26.800
Or a kill room.

38:26.800 --> 38:29.440
Well, well.

38:29.440 --> 38:36.960
If you're rich, there's a point of richness where the only thrill is taking human life.

38:36.960 --> 38:39.120
To feel someone's life run out in your hands.

38:39.120 --> 38:44.400
If you can feel their life run out in your hands and onto the polished marble of your

38:44.400 --> 38:47.040
giant bathtub, then you have truly lived.

38:47.040 --> 38:50.160
And I would also like to take a moment to thank Extreme Restraints for sponsoring the

38:50.160 --> 38:52.800
show and allowing us to reach that level of richness.

38:52.800 --> 39:00.160
Yes, when you guys go to someone else's shower at their home and you're a guest in their

39:00.160 --> 39:07.840
home and you probably brought your own accoutrement, your own shampoo, or maybe you didn't.

39:07.840 --> 39:09.120
I never do that.

39:09.120 --> 39:12.720
Do you use that as an opportunity to just like just try it?

39:13.280 --> 39:14.880
Just sample, see what's out there.

39:14.880 --> 39:16.080
Yes, of course.

39:16.080 --> 39:17.600
A couple different kinds of shampoo.

39:17.600 --> 39:19.440
There's always like weird scrubs.

39:19.440 --> 39:21.200
I do this in my own bathroom.

39:21.200 --> 39:25.280
I don't know what some of these scrubs are, but I'll, you know, I'll try it out.

39:25.280 --> 39:27.760
Ooh, is that a coconut husks?

39:27.760 --> 39:29.600
I also do the same with their medication.

39:30.560 --> 39:31.760
Yeah, sure.

39:31.760 --> 39:32.720
That looks tasty.

39:32.720 --> 39:33.360
I want to eat that.

39:34.320 --> 39:35.840
Sometimes I'll just like, I'll kill them.

39:36.560 --> 39:42.080
And then just like, I just assume, I'll just assume their life, you know?

39:42.080 --> 39:44.080
Sure, sure, sure, sure, sure.

39:44.080 --> 39:46.000
I'll just like take, I'll just like take charge.

39:46.000 --> 39:49.600
Because really, when you smell like someone, you're basically walking a mile in their

39:49.600 --> 39:51.360
shoes and their smell shoes.

39:53.760 --> 39:56.880
I really do never bring my shampoo anywhere.

39:56.880 --> 40:00.880
And like, I'll get indignant about it if I stay at somebody's house and they like don't

40:00.880 --> 40:02.000
have conditioner.

40:02.000 --> 40:03.760
Like, oh, thanks guys.

40:03.760 --> 40:04.480
I'm just, you know what?

40:04.480 --> 40:05.040
I'm just going to go.

40:05.040 --> 40:06.880
There's, I saw a puddle out on the street.

40:06.880 --> 40:08.800
I'll just splash around in that for a while.

40:08.800 --> 40:10.000
Are you fucking kidding me?

40:12.000 --> 40:12.640
What a nightmare.

40:12.640 --> 40:16.320
Oh, you have hand soap in the shower and you use that for, I didn't know that you were

40:16.320 --> 40:18.000
a giant hand, sir.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.800
I didn't know that your body was made up entirely of hands.

40:20.800 --> 40:21.760
So that's cool.

40:21.760 --> 40:23.040
I guess that's what you think of me.

40:24.640 --> 40:29.040
Why don't you just spit on me over and over again until I'm wet enough and clean enough?

40:29.840 --> 40:35.520
You've already metaphorically spit on me by not offering me the finest shampoos and conditioners.

40:35.520 --> 40:37.520
Or just any shampoo and conditioner.

40:38.080 --> 40:41.360
I think it's just because I get so excited when I put on a new shampoo, you know?

40:41.360 --> 40:41.920
Sure.

40:41.920 --> 40:42.400
What's it?

40:42.400 --> 40:44.080
Maybe this will be the one, you know?

40:44.080 --> 40:46.880
I am in dire need of your assistance this holiday.

40:46.880 --> 40:48.800
Read family centric season.

40:49.760 --> 40:53.440
My boyfriend and I have been friends for six years together for three and have lived in

40:53.440 --> 40:54.880
sin for the last 1.5.

40:55.600 --> 41:00.000
I don't see his family very often, but when I do, things seem a bit strained.

41:00.000 --> 41:04.720
Thing is, I'm not sure if his parents don't like me or if they're just stoic.

41:04.720 --> 41:09.440
How can I suss this out without stepping up to one of them over the punch bowl and saying,

41:09.440 --> 41:11.200
Hey, we cool?

41:11.920 --> 41:12.640
That's a good question.

41:12.640 --> 41:15.120
We cool? That's Outkast from Indiana.

41:16.080 --> 41:16.560
Are we good?

41:16.560 --> 41:17.920
They probably like you enough.

41:19.680 --> 41:20.640
How do you know that, though?

41:21.360 --> 41:21.840
I don't.

41:23.520 --> 41:24.960
It really depends on if you have...

41:26.640 --> 41:33.520
You gotta adopt the speak when spoken to sort of deference to their family and tell like

41:33.520 --> 41:35.840
you can figure out how to worm your way in there.

41:36.640 --> 41:39.760
And sometimes it takes longer than other times.

41:39.760 --> 41:46.160
But I think it... I've always been of the opinion that like if the person you're dating

41:46.160 --> 41:51.120
is cool, then they probably have some level of coolness in their family that you can tap

41:51.120 --> 41:52.160
into, you know?

41:52.160 --> 41:58.000
I think everybody's family just wants their child to be happy.

41:58.000 --> 41:58.560
Right.

41:58.560 --> 42:02.960
So if you make him happy, then I don't think they'll have a problem with you.

42:02.960 --> 42:08.000
It could just be, and this is, I have seen this many times, they could just be kind of

42:08.000 --> 42:09.840
an uptight, stressed out family, you know?

42:09.840 --> 42:12.960
Like they could just... You could be feeling a lot of family dynamics.

42:12.960 --> 42:16.640
And I also feel that there may be people out there going now, well, not everybody just

42:16.640 --> 42:17.760
wants their person to be happy.

42:17.760 --> 42:19.600
Some people's families are awful.

42:19.600 --> 42:20.320
Possible.

42:20.320 --> 42:23.840
But if that's the case, then what does it matter whether they like you or not?

42:23.840 --> 42:25.440
Like it's win-win.

42:25.440 --> 42:30.240
Either the family is cool because a cool person came from it or a cool person came from it

42:30.240 --> 42:38.800
in defiance of how uncool it is, in which case you don't lose anything by them not liking you.

42:38.800 --> 42:42.400
Now, have you ever heard people talk about like getting really stressed at the holidays

42:42.400 --> 42:44.080
or like this kind of thing stresses them out?

42:44.080 --> 42:48.240
Like, and spending time with the in-laws and that's stressing them out.

42:48.240 --> 42:49.360
That is, I mean...

42:49.360 --> 42:50.880
That's a human experience.

42:50.880 --> 42:52.400
That's what you're experiencing right now.

42:52.400 --> 42:54.320
Like it's not an uncommon thing.

42:54.320 --> 43:00.560
It's like we are comfortable with the people we live with because we've decided that that's

43:00.560 --> 43:02.240
a situation we can handle.

43:02.240 --> 43:06.560
But when you start inviting people you don't live with in your home, nobody really wants that.

43:06.560 --> 43:06.800
Yeah.

43:06.800 --> 43:08.560
And I think there's always a level of this.

43:08.560 --> 43:14.000
Like, you go stay in anyone's home, even if it's like your best friend and you always

43:14.000 --> 43:18.480
have to put on a little bit of a layer of like, well, I'm going to be more polite and

43:18.480 --> 43:22.640
more conscientious, more clean than I am in my own home.

43:22.640 --> 43:24.640
Like you don't get to just be yourself.

43:24.640 --> 43:29.600
Add to that the layer of it being your significant other's family that you don't see that often,

43:29.600 --> 43:30.880
that you don't know that well.

43:31.600 --> 43:33.200
They're doing the same thing back.

43:33.200 --> 43:38.080
Like, there's just a lot of pressure on both sides to be like, hey, be on your best behavior.

43:38.080 --> 43:39.520
Be interesting.

43:39.520 --> 43:40.080
Be fun.

43:41.120 --> 43:45.200
Lean into it is advice that's always really, really good.

43:46.560 --> 43:50.720
And just like maybe this Christmas, maybe you drop a few daddies in there.

43:50.720 --> 43:53.600
Maybe a few mommies and a few daddies.

43:53.600 --> 43:54.960
Start laying that seed.

43:54.960 --> 43:58.080
Unky, bro-bro, sissy, sissy-sissy-siss.

43:58.960 --> 44:00.400
Hey, sis, you want to go to the mall?

44:02.160 --> 44:03.200
Sissy.

44:03.840 --> 44:05.360
And you give them all that.

44:05.360 --> 44:09.840
And then you jump to the other end of the spectrum.

44:09.840 --> 44:12.160
And then maybe next year you can find a happy medium.

44:14.000 --> 44:18.480
I'm still not sure of your ability to make our son happy and keep him safe.

44:18.480 --> 44:21.760
But for Christ's sakes, at least you're not weirding us out anymore.

44:21.760 --> 44:24.160
At least you're not like that girl he was dating last year.

44:24.160 --> 44:25.040
Oh, that was you?

44:25.040 --> 44:25.600
Oh, shit.

44:26.160 --> 44:30.320
Recently, two of my closest friends got in a fight that permanently ended their friendship.

44:30.320 --> 44:33.600
While I've successfully stayed out of the conflict and managed to maintain my relationship

44:33.600 --> 44:35.840
with both of them, it's still affecting me.

44:35.840 --> 44:40.240
Since they can no longer be in the same room, I want to have a Christmas party,

44:40.240 --> 44:42.160
but I can't figure out how to deal with inviting them.

44:42.720 --> 44:46.400
How do I get out of the situation with my friendships intact?

44:46.400 --> 44:47.840
That's from Baffled and Brooklyn.

44:47.840 --> 44:48.560
Yay!

44:48.560 --> 44:51.600
Guys, we have like a Sacred Order of the Water Buffalo thing going on.

44:52.320 --> 44:54.000
I think it's time for a farce.

44:56.240 --> 44:57.680
Oh, shit.

44:57.680 --> 45:00.480
Nobody ever gets in these situations, and you need to be so thankful,

45:00.480 --> 45:03.840
because now you have the perfect setup for a holiday farce.

45:04.480 --> 45:06.320
Okay, so you're gonna have two parties.

45:08.160 --> 45:09.520
Fucking, it's a Santa Claus party.

45:09.520 --> 45:10.960
Everybody come dressed up like Santa Claus.

45:10.960 --> 45:12.400
Nobody knows who's in the room.

45:12.400 --> 45:13.280
Okay, I love it.

45:13.280 --> 45:18.640
Maybe, maybe eventually it turns into like an Eyes Wide Shut.

45:18.640 --> 45:19.760
Let's not think about that.

45:19.760 --> 45:23.120
Well, I'm just saying, I'm just saying, this is a dual scenario, you guys.

45:23.120 --> 45:25.440
Secret Order of the Water Buffalo, and you have an Eyes Wide Shut,

45:25.440 --> 45:29.760
because maybe people have fun and they can't tell that they hate each other because they're exes,

45:29.760 --> 45:30.880
but then maybe things get weird.

45:30.880 --> 45:31.840
Maybe some dicks come out.

45:32.480 --> 45:34.880
But then, you have your friend Barn, right?

45:34.880 --> 45:35.920
And Barney's there.

45:35.920 --> 45:36.400
Barney's there.

45:36.400 --> 45:39.200
He's gonna help usher one of the bad friends around.

45:39.200 --> 45:39.840
Correct.

45:39.840 --> 45:43.040
But then Barn, you only know his name is Barn.

45:43.040 --> 45:44.000
You've never met him.

45:44.000 --> 45:44.320
No.

45:44.320 --> 45:46.240
He's just a friend of a friend of a friend.

45:46.240 --> 45:46.880
Named Barn.

45:47.520 --> 45:52.080
Barn, and he shows up, and it turns out that Barn is not the Barn you thought he was,

45:52.080 --> 45:53.840
so Barn doesn't know his ass from his elbow.

45:53.840 --> 45:59.040
Okay, can we also say that on the invitation to this Santa Claus secret orgy,

45:59.040 --> 46:02.000
that everybody has to be called Barn?

46:03.120 --> 46:05.280
Oh yeah, and everybody's called Barn there.

46:05.280 --> 46:06.800
Sure, I love it.

46:06.800 --> 46:12.400
And then one person comes dressed as a Barn because they got confused by the invitation,

46:12.400 --> 46:16.160
but he's just there for like the whimsical end of act one moment.

46:16.160 --> 46:16.720
Oh yeah.

46:16.720 --> 46:23.840
And there's a big plate of shrimp, and someone's allergic,

46:23.840 --> 46:26.160
except everyone's dressed like Santa, so you don't know who.

46:26.160 --> 46:27.680
And that person eats the shrimp.

46:27.680 --> 46:28.160
I love it.

46:28.720 --> 46:30.800
Because they also don't know who they are.

46:33.360 --> 46:37.440
They get so enveloped in the Barn lifestyle that they forget their own-

46:37.440 --> 46:39.040
Am I the one that's allergic to shrimp?

46:39.040 --> 46:39.920
Are you the one?

46:39.920 --> 46:42.480
I don't know, we're both dressed as Santa Claus.

46:42.480 --> 46:43.520
Okay, I got it.

46:43.520 --> 46:47.440
One of your friends is allergic to imitation crab, but you lie to everyone and tell them

46:47.440 --> 46:50.640
it's real crab because you don't want them to know that your husband just got laid off

46:50.640 --> 46:51.280
from his job.

46:51.280 --> 46:51.920
Okay.

46:51.920 --> 46:53.280
At the end, he's going to get a new job.

46:53.840 --> 46:55.360
Okay, from the guy dressed as a Barn.

46:57.200 --> 46:57.840
Oh man.

46:58.640 --> 47:01.520
You know what's great is that because this question is from Brooklyn,

47:01.520 --> 47:05.360
this is going to be like the seventh weirdest party that all of these people have gone to.

47:05.360 --> 47:12.240
Yeah, we just got out of a very Skrillex Christmas where everybody shaved their head like Skrillex.

47:12.240 --> 47:16.720
We were just having a party at an abandoned axe factory and instead of eggnog, they just

47:16.720 --> 47:17.200
had eggs.

47:18.080 --> 47:19.200
It was awesome.

47:19.200 --> 47:20.720
I was aw- It was a pretty good party.

47:20.720 --> 47:23.200
They had Christmas lights and Tony Bennett was there.

47:23.200 --> 47:25.120
We lumberjacked for like 12 hours.

47:25.840 --> 47:26.800
We were just lumberjacking.

47:26.800 --> 47:28.960
Do you have a futon I can just crash on for a bit?

47:29.520 --> 47:30.800
I'm exhausted.

47:30.800 --> 47:33.840
To answer your question, what you have to do is you have to invite both of your friends

47:33.840 --> 47:37.440
and then tell them both that the other one is also invited and then neither one of them

47:37.440 --> 47:38.800
will come and you won't have to deal with it.

47:40.880 --> 47:42.240
Make it their problem.

47:42.240 --> 47:43.760
This isn't your problem.

47:43.760 --> 47:47.280
Tell them that they're both invited and then they should probably patch things up before

47:47.280 --> 47:49.680
the party because you're not going to have baby Desus's.

47:49.680 --> 47:52.640
I invited Amanda and Amanda, I invited Susan.

47:52.640 --> 47:57.520
If you guys show up to my party and start shit, I swear to God, I will kick you out.

47:57.520 --> 47:58.880
So that's going to do it for us.

47:58.880 --> 48:01.920
Thank you guys so much for listening to our program.

48:01.920 --> 48:10.800
Next week will be our holiday special, Candle Nights, and we hope you'll join us again for

48:10.800 --> 48:17.520
that because it'll be a family friendly program, something you can listen to with Unky Dan.

48:17.520 --> 48:18.400
Are we?

48:18.400 --> 48:20.240
We're still looking for questions.

48:20.240 --> 48:24.400
Do we have Extreme Restraints on the calendar to be a sponsor?

48:24.400 --> 48:25.040
Yes.

48:25.040 --> 48:26.800
Oh my God, this is going to be amazing.

48:26.800 --> 48:31.280
We gotta do a PG Extreme Restraint.

48:31.280 --> 48:32.160
We'll figure it out.

48:32.160 --> 48:33.280
Oh my God.

48:33.280 --> 48:33.840
Tune in.

48:33.840 --> 48:34.880
It's going to be the best.

48:36.800 --> 48:41.120
And thank you for people tweeting about the show on Twitter.

48:41.120 --> 48:50.400
Abald Wookiee, Jeremy Franklin, Swellers UK, Agent Eli, Iron Slayer 13, Poe Bro, MC Ginnin,

48:50.400 --> 48:57.040
Geeky Lindsey, S&B Records, Ben Kerrigan, Insane Barry.

48:58.080 --> 48:58.800
Are you going to sleep?

48:58.800 --> 49:00.560
On that Christmas tree.

49:00.560 --> 49:02.400
And then Justin faded away.

49:02.400 --> 49:06.800
We'd also like to say thank you to all of our sponsors and especially to Audible.com.

49:07.520 --> 49:12.240
And now I would like to do my impression of the girl that read our Audible commercial.

49:12.240 --> 49:28.720
OK, let's hear it.

49:28.720 --> 49:48.400
Oh, Travis, that was fantastic.

49:48.400 --> 49:51.360
Man, that is a dynamite impression.

49:51.360 --> 49:52.720
I've been working on it for four weeks.

49:53.280 --> 49:56.560
I want to thank John Roderick and The Long Winters for the use of our theme song

49:56.560 --> 49:58.560
It's a Departure off the album Putting the Days to Bed.

49:58.560 --> 50:02.240
You can actually get John Roderick and Jonathan Coulton's Christmas album

50:02.240 --> 50:05.760
One Christmas at a Time now available in all the stores.

50:06.720 --> 50:09.840
Actually, I don't know what stores it's available in, but it's a good listen.

50:09.840 --> 50:11.200
It will fill you with so much cheer.

50:12.480 --> 50:13.360
So go look into that.

50:14.640 --> 50:17.440
If you if you want One Christmas at a Time, just Google it.

50:17.440 --> 50:18.400
Yeah, just Google it.

50:18.400 --> 50:20.240
And I bet it will just it'll just turn up.

50:20.240 --> 50:20.880
You know where it is?

50:20.880 --> 50:22.160
You know where I can say officially it is?

50:22.160 --> 50:22.960
It is on Amazon.

50:22.960 --> 50:23.760
Yeah, OK.

50:23.760 --> 50:25.040
Well, so you can get there.

50:25.040 --> 50:30.160
Also in all books, a million and orders and then a couple of Pat Smart's.

50:30.160 --> 50:30.880
Walton Books.

50:32.080 --> 50:32.960
These are all things.

50:34.720 --> 50:37.440
These are still exit retailers that you could go to.

50:37.440 --> 50:43.600
And hey, everybody, thank you for the warm the warm wishes on my life change.

50:43.600 --> 50:44.480
My life decision.

50:44.480 --> 50:46.320
Yeah, it was really nice.

50:46.320 --> 50:49.200
We got so much cool stuff in the mail, by the way.

50:49.840 --> 50:52.400
We got some magic cards.

50:52.400 --> 50:54.400
We got the Wisconsin Hustle.

50:54.400 --> 50:55.280
It's a card game.

50:56.640 --> 50:58.800
A guy dressed up as a pilgrim.

50:59.360 --> 51:02.240
Burgess sent us a fine note.

51:02.240 --> 51:04.560
Got a postcard from Des Moines from Rachel.

51:05.200 --> 51:08.320
A postcard from cash strapped in California.

51:09.120 --> 51:09.840
It's lovely.

51:10.880 --> 51:11.920
So much cool stuff.

51:11.920 --> 51:13.840
Kinjaman sent us a very nice note.

51:14.880 --> 51:20.000
And I just really appreciate everybody because it really means a lot to get those little

51:20.000 --> 51:20.320
notes.

51:20.320 --> 51:26.480
We're at PO Box 54, Huntington, West Virginia, 25706.

51:27.200 --> 51:28.800
Edward Rogers sent us a note, too.

51:30.400 --> 51:34.400
So if you want to mail us something of value, I would appreciate it.

51:34.400 --> 51:35.680
Yeah, not just notes.

51:35.680 --> 51:36.880
Not just garbage.

51:37.520 --> 51:38.640
Sent us a nice present.

51:38.640 --> 51:39.680
Precious rubies.

51:40.880 --> 51:42.560
Got art that you made about us.

51:42.560 --> 51:43.360
We really like that.

51:44.080 --> 51:46.320
This Final Yahoo is sent in by Renee Laburn.

51:46.320 --> 51:47.040
Thank you, Renee.

51:47.040 --> 51:55.120
It's by Yahoo Answers user tepsi, who asks, what are the vegetables at Subway?

51:55.120 --> 51:56.000
List all of them.

51:56.000 --> 51:57.120
Don't just guess, please.

52:00.400 --> 52:01.440
I'm just McElroy.

52:01.440 --> 52:02.800
I'm Travis McElroy.

52:02.800 --> 52:05.920
I'm Hank the Spank Tank Flankerjunk.

52:05.920 --> 52:07.200
This has been the Pleasure Garden.

52:07.920 --> 52:08.640
Kiss your dad.

52:10.480 --> 52:12.240
Not for sex, Ruben.

52:12.240 --> 52:22.240
Have sex time.

52:31.360 --> 52:32.080
Hey, folks.

52:32.080 --> 52:37.600
This is Kevin Allison of The State and the podcast RISK, where people tell true stories

52:37.600 --> 52:39.520

RISK is the latest addition to the roster of podcasts at Maximum Fun, and it is jam-packed

52:45.200 --> 52:46.720

52:53.520 --> 52:56.640
hilarious stories, tear-jerking stories.

52:56.640 --> 53:01.920
You won't believe how real and raw and surprising RISK can be.

53:01.920 --> 53:06.160
Both radio-style stories and stories told at our live shows, you've heard people say,

53:06.160 --> 53:09.680
oh, too much information, don't be sharing that in mixed company.

53:09.680 --> 53:12.000
Well, at RISK, we say, screw that.

Anything goes.
