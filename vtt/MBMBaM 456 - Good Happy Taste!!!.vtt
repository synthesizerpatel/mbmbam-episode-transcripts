00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:45.920
Hello everybody and welcome to My Brother, My Brother,

00:45.920 --> 00:49.760
me and the advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

00:49.760 --> 00:52.800
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis the McElroy.

00:53.360 --> 00:58.640
But I don't want to record a podcast. But I don't want to record a podcast today.

00:59.200 --> 01:00.000
Oh, I see.

01:00.000 --> 01:03.760
It's my birthday. I don't want to record a podcast today.

01:03.760 --> 01:06.560
It's Griffin's birthday, except you're getting all the presents.

01:06.560 --> 01:08.320
I want cakes and creams.

01:09.120 --> 01:10.880
Oh no, not this again.

01:10.880 --> 01:18.640
I want cakes and creams. I want candies and streamers and sticky, sticky toffee, not a podcast.

01:18.640 --> 01:21.280
Every year, and I'm sure you all have noticed it because we've been doing My Brother,

01:21.280 --> 01:24.720
My Brother, Me for about 18 years now. Every year on his birthday,

01:24.720 --> 01:30.880
Griffin becomes little lord birthday and it's a whole thing. He's done it literally since he was

01:30.880 --> 01:36.480
born. He came out of the womb doing it, which was very troubling for everyone.

01:37.520 --> 01:41.600
And it's all about how it's his birthday and he wants candies and cakes and creams.

01:41.600 --> 01:43.920
Where are my Shetland ponies, daddy?

01:43.920 --> 01:45.360
And he needs the Shetland ponies.

01:45.360 --> 01:46.640
And call him daddy.

01:46.640 --> 01:50.240
I can't play with the Shetland ponies if I'm doing a podcast, daddy.

01:51.040 --> 01:52.560
And he never wants to do a podcast.

01:52.560 --> 01:55.760
I remember, I think he was six years old when he first started saying,

01:55.760 --> 01:58.320
I don't want to do the podcast, which was confusing.

01:58.320 --> 02:04.080
He was the first, historically speaking, is the first use of the term.

02:04.080 --> 02:04.400
Yes.

02:04.960 --> 02:08.320
Podcast was amended by Griffin when he was six and not wanting to do one.

02:08.320 --> 02:10.800
Did the two of you even bring cakes and creams?

02:11.520 --> 02:13.920
I sent you a birthday present. Did you get it?

02:14.560 --> 02:19.280
I've not received a present from you, but the fact that you've said it's not cakes or creams.

02:19.280 --> 02:19.840
It might be.

02:19.840 --> 02:24.160
I sent a bottle of sparkling apple juice to your house. Did you get it?

02:24.880 --> 02:25.840
Fuck, that's funny.

02:26.720 --> 02:27.920
It's funny.

02:27.920 --> 02:30.880
You guys like SNL? That's what I call SNL.

02:30.880 --> 02:32.240
Yeah, that shit's good.

02:32.240 --> 02:35.520
Oh, you snapped Griffin out of it with your super funny joke. Good job, Justin.

02:35.520 --> 02:39.680
It was less a joke, more of a reference to an obscure SNL bit.

02:39.680 --> 02:42.880
Yeah. I'm back. Yeah, I'm ready to do this one.

02:42.880 --> 02:44.800
I mean, it wasn't a joke. I would rather not be.

02:46.160 --> 02:48.640
I'd rather not be doing it. I'd rather be, you know.

02:48.640 --> 02:53.440
What have you got? Let's talk about the gifts. Gifts so far. What have you got?

02:54.480 --> 03:01.200
I got a bottle of water with a screw top lid from our business manager, Amanda,

03:01.200 --> 03:07.520
because during the last tour she watched me twice open up the lid that has a little hidden straw

03:07.520 --> 03:12.160
in it of my Contigo after being on an airplane with it, and it blasted me fully in the face like

03:12.160 --> 03:17.600
a clown's flower. Stranger saw me do this and so did Amanda, so she got me one that's a little more

03:17.600 --> 03:24.960
foolproof than that. What else? Daddy got me a Spider-Man statue, and then I just noticed that

03:25.840 --> 03:32.320
Justin, you and Sydney have gone in together on a, I believe, a classroom.

03:33.200 --> 03:33.840
Yes.

03:33.840 --> 03:37.760
You got me a classroom, and I don't know where. It says a gift of a new classroom,

03:37.760 --> 03:42.880
and I don't know what I'm supposed to teach in OIC.

03:42.880 --> 03:48.560
You actually don't. This is the great thing. It's a classroom in the Sudan somewhere teaching

03:48.560 --> 03:52.960
impoverished children stuff, and you don't have to do anything. You just can bask in the reflected

03:52.960 --> 03:57.040
glow of knowing that there's good in the world happening in your name.

03:57.040 --> 04:00.960
That is nice, but Gervin, can I tell you what I got you? It should have been delivered,

04:02.080 --> 04:06.560
I believe, like the 14th or 15th. Did I send it to the wrong house again? I might have. I was

04:06.560 --> 04:09.360
about to ask you your address, and then I remembered we were recording a podcast for

04:09.360 --> 04:15.440
Public Assumption. Do you want to know what it is? Sure. It's a bidet. Oh, Trev.

04:16.400 --> 04:17.840
Yeah. Shouldn't have.

04:17.840 --> 04:23.040
So it's like Justin got you that really nice classroom thing that helps other people,

04:23.040 --> 04:24.800
and I got something nice for your butt.

04:24.800 --> 04:29.440
That's great because the world has problems, and I love gifts like Justin's because it helps

04:30.160 --> 04:37.040
cater to those problems, but I'm also having a problem, and it's just my blighted bung has just

04:37.040 --> 04:43.440
been a real issue for me lately, and I'm really happy for the immediate sort of salve that my

04:44.160 --> 04:46.400
favorite brother Travis has provided for me.

04:46.400 --> 04:50.560
Excellent. But Justin, yours is very nice. I like how it helps people or whatever.

04:50.560 --> 04:54.400
Justin, let me say this. If you want to one-up him, because now we've got to fight our hands,

04:54.400 --> 04:57.520
and this is always how I got the best presents growing up. If you want to one-up him,

04:57.520 --> 05:01.760
may I suggest Cakes and Creams? Cakes and Creams. I should have thought of that.

05:01.760 --> 05:08.400
No, you can do both. It's an add-on. It's a DLC for the Sudanese classroom.

05:08.400 --> 05:14.320
Yeah, that way everybody wins with that one. With that one, everybody wins.

05:14.320 --> 05:16.080
I get something, they get something.

05:16.080 --> 05:20.160
So anyway, folks, thanks so much for listening to our podcast. We're excited to get going.

05:21.120 --> 05:23.760
Happy birthday to you, Griffin. So excited.

05:25.120 --> 05:28.080
32 is the backwards Michael Jordan number.

05:28.080 --> 05:32.240
Boop, boop, boop, boop. Huge. Huge. That's a massive milestone.

05:34.400 --> 05:37.360
Okay, here's a question. I'll be attending a Billy Joel concert,

05:37.360 --> 05:39.920
which is also his 70th birthday celebration.

05:39.920 --> 05:43.360
What if he tries to stop the concerts? Will they bring him Cakes and Creams?

05:45.840 --> 05:47.520
That sounds like something he would actually do.

05:48.480 --> 05:51.520
Should I bring a gift? No. How do I get it to him? You can't.

05:51.520 --> 05:55.360
What do I buy? What do you buy for the piano man who has everything?

05:55.360 --> 05:59.280
And that's from Unsure on the Upper West Side.

05:59.280 --> 06:03.440
It's Billy's birthday and that you get the present this year

06:03.440 --> 06:09.760
because Billy is bringing to you all of his great hits of the 50s and 60s and today.

06:11.200 --> 06:13.520
What's the spirit of the 50s and 60s? It's still rocking on him.

06:13.520 --> 06:18.640
The spirit of 50s and 60s through the lens of 80s just probably really coked up in us.

06:18.640 --> 06:24.320
Yeah. Let me ask you guys this. If you had the chance to get Billy Joel something, what would it be?

06:28.560 --> 06:29.200
Tombstone.

06:34.800 --> 06:39.760
It's irreverent. It's an irreverent humor that I like to do, my own twisted South Park humor.

06:39.760 --> 06:41.120
It is irreverent.

06:41.120 --> 06:45.680
I think I would get him the chance to switch places with me for one day.

06:45.680 --> 06:47.040
Ah, Prince and Pop are that shit.

06:47.040 --> 06:50.960
Yeah, take the pressure off him. Let me be the piano man for one day

06:50.960 --> 06:55.840
and he can just be a man without all the pressure, without all the piano pressure.

06:58.560 --> 07:02.960
Travis has just texted asking for my address just to update everybody.

07:02.960 --> 07:05.760
That was just a private thing. I was trying to send you a birthday birthday.

07:07.280 --> 07:11.440
Here's what you could do. Okay, let me hit you with this.

07:11.440 --> 07:22.240
Sit him down in a comfortable chair in front of a piano and then you sit down at a different angle

07:22.240 --> 07:27.840
and then you turn the piano towards yourself and you say, no, no, no, Billy, allow me.

07:28.640 --> 07:33.760
And then you play a version of We Didn't Start the Fire that encompasses all of his

07:33.760 --> 07:40.880
and then everything that happened in the 30 years since We Didn't Start the Fire.

07:40.880 --> 07:43.920
Oh, gosh, and you think you would appreciate that?

07:43.920 --> 07:48.240
I think it's like, I want you to know, Billy, that you didn't start the fire,

07:48.880 --> 07:54.560
but I'm taking the fire. I'm picking up your torch and I'm going to carry it on for you

07:54.560 --> 07:58.720
and I'll continue to update this song that you seem unwilling to.

07:58.720 --> 08:00.800
Title it, I Will Finish the Fire.

08:00.800 --> 08:03.200
I Will Complete the Fire for Willie Joel.

08:03.200 --> 08:08.800
Now, did you just call him Willie Joel? His friends call him Willie Joel.

08:09.520 --> 08:10.800
Willie Joel Pianoman.

08:12.400 --> 08:20.080
I would bet a million doll hairs that this is not the first time we've talked about an updated

08:20.080 --> 08:21.360
We Didn't Start the Fire.

08:21.360 --> 08:22.560
I'm almost certain, yeah, almost certain.

08:22.560 --> 08:25.120
It is the first time, though, that I'm thinking critically about the song

08:25.120 --> 08:32.720
We Didn't Start the Fire and it's pretty shit, huh?

08:32.720 --> 08:36.240
It's not, if you think about Billy Joel sitting down at the old desk and saying like,

08:36.800 --> 08:41.840
shit sucks right now, shit's getting really wild and people need me, Willie Joe Pianoman,

08:41.840 --> 08:46.800
to really crack out a dinger for them that's going to help them soothe their soul

08:46.800 --> 08:52.160
and give them some artistic nourishment that addresses the issues of our time.

08:52.160 --> 08:55.920
I am going to write this song that is all about, A, passing the buck.

08:58.000 --> 08:58.720
We didn't do it.

08:58.720 --> 09:02.240
And then also, in lieu of having a message to the song,

09:02.240 --> 09:07.600
I'm just going to say I'm going to flip through some microfiche at my local library

09:07.600 --> 09:11.520
and just write down the words of things that I see there.

09:11.520 --> 09:16.880
He did kind of write it like an eighth grader doing like a report on something

09:16.880 --> 09:22.480
he didn't really read but just kind of read the back cover like, you know, Berlin Wall, JFK.

09:24.480 --> 09:26.000
Leonard Bernstein.

09:26.960 --> 09:28.720
I think he was a dude, he was there.

09:28.720 --> 09:31.520
Yeah, I am a little sad.

09:32.720 --> 09:35.760
I'm happy for his 70th birthday.

09:35.760 --> 09:37.760
Huge congratulations, Billy.

09:39.120 --> 09:45.040
It is a little sad though that we're in the last few weeks of him being 69.

09:46.400 --> 09:49.440
And we haven't really used it enough, I would say.

09:49.440 --> 09:53.520
I would say we have not taken advantage of the fact that he is 69.

09:54.240 --> 09:56.000
We didn't even talk about it, it feels like.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.720
We could have referenced it so much more.

09:58.720 --> 10:05.520
It is the law that when you are 69, you have to do it that particular maneuver more often.

10:05.520 --> 10:11.520
So I bet he really knows how to just wail on that harmonica if you know what I'm talking about.

10:11.520 --> 10:13.040
Aw, Griffin.

10:13.040 --> 10:13.920
Come on, Griffin.

10:13.920 --> 10:15.200
It's still Billy Joel.

10:15.200 --> 10:17.600
Sir Billy Joel, he deserves our respect.

10:17.600 --> 10:20.480
Have you ever noticed how Piano Man starts with the harmonica solo?

10:22.480 --> 10:24.080
Do y'all ever think about that?

10:24.080 --> 10:26.160
I think about that every time that goddamn song starts.

10:27.360 --> 10:28.080
How about a yahoo?

10:29.440 --> 10:31.200
I wish Billy Joel was funnier.

10:32.560 --> 10:34.480
Wait, as a person or as a topic?

10:34.480 --> 10:35.440
As a topic.

10:35.440 --> 10:41.760
I feel like Billy Joel is so buckwild in all his endeavors that he deflects.

10:43.440 --> 10:48.800
You try to make fun of Billy Joel as we have valiantly attempted for the past five minutes,

10:48.800 --> 10:50.000
and then Billy Joel's like,

10:50.000 --> 10:54.880
oh, good joke, check this out, it's the video for River of Dreams.

10:54.880 --> 10:56.960
I did this one on me.

10:56.960 --> 10:59.520
So what do you have in the fucking tank?

10:59.520 --> 11:00.640
You have nothing.

11:00.640 --> 11:01.840
I am bulletproof.

11:03.440 --> 11:05.200
So here's a yahoo that was sent in by Jack.

11:05.200 --> 11:05.760
Thanks, Jack.

11:05.760 --> 11:09.120
It's yahoo answers user Bobby.

11:09.680 --> 11:15.840
Bobby asks, if I'm a 14 year old, that's a wild way to say it.

11:15.840 --> 11:18.880
I guess it's yahoo answers, so it has to be in the form of a question.

11:18.880 --> 11:26.560
Question, if I am a 14 year old and my family has a guinea pig, is he my brother or son?

11:28.960 --> 11:34.480
If I'm a 14 year old and my family has a guinea pig, is he my brother or son?

11:35.920 --> 11:38.080
Is it possible he's your Belvedere?

11:39.600 --> 11:42.000
No, obviously, obviously no.

11:42.000 --> 11:45.600
Update, I understand that technically he is neither since I am not a guinea pig.

11:45.600 --> 11:51.760
I think we're talking about structurally in the caste system of the family.

11:51.760 --> 11:59.920
You're drawing the family tree from which branch does, you know, little Bingbing Dangle.

12:00.640 --> 12:02.080
Wait, who's Bingbing Dangle?

12:02.640 --> 12:04.080
The guinea pig.

12:04.080 --> 12:06.080
His name is Bingbing Dangle?

12:06.080 --> 12:06.800
Yes.

12:06.800 --> 12:08.160
What a great name.

12:08.160 --> 12:08.960
Where's he at?

12:08.960 --> 12:09.760
Where does he live?

12:09.760 --> 12:12.880
Is he a son or a brother to the 14 year old?

12:12.880 --> 12:15.600
He might be the 14 year old's dad.

12:16.400 --> 12:17.120
All right.

12:17.120 --> 12:20.400
I'm saying why do we assume that he's equal or less than?

12:21.920 --> 12:22.640
It's your brother.

12:22.640 --> 12:23.360
It's your brother.

12:23.360 --> 12:24.320
This is your new brother.

12:25.360 --> 12:27.520
I'm gonna stick with you answer to the guinea pig now.

12:28.400 --> 12:33.120
But if I'm the one that picked him out of the pet land or whatever,

12:34.000 --> 12:36.800
I don't know if they do guinea pigs at your local shelter,

12:36.800 --> 12:39.680
but if they do, obviously that's the ideal scenario.

12:39.680 --> 12:43.680
Um, I'm pretty sure they sell these bad guys, these bad guys at Target.

12:45.120 --> 12:47.440
But if you're the one that picked him out from the Target lineup

12:47.440 --> 12:50.160
after shopping through Isaac Mizrahi's new collection,

12:50.160 --> 12:52.000
I think you're the father of this pig.

12:52.560 --> 12:56.400
Hello, I'm Isaac Mizrahi and these are my new gerbils.

12:56.400 --> 12:58.480
I'm selling them exclusively at Target.

12:58.480 --> 13:02.080
It's an Isaac Mizrahi branded line of guinea pigs.

13:02.960 --> 13:06.960
These rats are huge and they are colorful and they're,

13:06.960 --> 13:10.160
they're gonna awaken the goddess within you.

13:10.160 --> 13:14.160
I'm so proud of my new guinea pigs, exclusively at Target.

13:14.160 --> 13:16.960
You look like you could use a really soft rat.

13:16.960 --> 13:18.960
Here, try one of my chinchillas.

13:19.600 --> 13:21.840
Try one of these socially acceptable rats.

13:24.960 --> 13:30.160
Um, yeah, this is the first time somebody sees a frat rat, right?

13:30.160 --> 13:30.720
Yeah.

13:30.720 --> 13:33.120
They think, oh, it's a long one.

13:33.120 --> 13:36.320
Big old rat, gonna put it on my shoulders.

13:36.320 --> 13:39.280
I don't see why that was what we jumped to.

13:39.280 --> 13:43.600
That seems wild to me that we would make a pet from the ferret.

13:43.600 --> 13:46.880
A capybara, I would just go run and throw myself in the river

13:48.080 --> 13:49.920
I would drift away until I found a new home

13:49.920 --> 13:51.840
that this big, big rat didn't live in.

13:52.400 --> 13:58.320
I think that if you bring a guinea pig home, he's a roommate.

14:00.480 --> 14:04.400
I think that he has his space where he's in charge, right?

14:04.400 --> 14:07.200
Like, if you go in there and you're eating his food,

14:07.200 --> 14:08.880
he's going to be really mad at you.

14:08.880 --> 14:12.000
And if he was eating your food, you'd be really mad at him.

14:12.000 --> 14:15.120
And that's not something you would say about a son or a brother.

14:16.320 --> 14:18.720
If Griffin and Justin looked in the refrigerator,

14:18.720 --> 14:21.200
I wouldn't be like, they shouldn't be in the refrigerator.

14:21.200 --> 14:23.120
But if the guinea pig was in the refrigerator,

14:23.120 --> 14:24.880
I'd be like, hey, that's my stuff, Brian.

14:26.160 --> 14:28.000
Actually, if I got in Charles' refrigerator,

14:28.000 --> 14:29.760
he would probably tell me to get out of his refrigerator.

14:29.760 --> 14:30.160
That's true.

14:30.160 --> 14:31.600
I watched the Punky Brewster episode.

14:31.600 --> 14:34.640
I know it's not safe to play in the refrigerator.

14:34.640 --> 14:36.480
Well, I didn't have a safety concern in mind,

14:36.480 --> 14:37.440
but of course, yes.

14:37.440 --> 14:39.120
Well, yeah, that's fine.

14:39.120 --> 14:42.560
I cannot tell you the number of times I've gone downstairs

14:42.560 --> 14:45.360
from my office to get a nice cold can of LaCroix

14:45.360 --> 14:46.960
from the refrigerator and open it up

14:46.960 --> 14:49.200
and had to fish my dang oldest brother out of there.

14:51.440 --> 14:57.120
Was there a time when you couldn't open a refrigerator

14:57.120 --> 14:57.920
from the inside?

14:58.480 --> 14:59.200
Yeah, yeah.

14:59.200 --> 15:00.080
Yes, absolutely.

15:00.080 --> 15:00.880
That's a problem?

15:00.880 --> 15:02.960
It's not an ongoing problem.

15:02.960 --> 15:04.880
It just seems unlikely.

15:04.880 --> 15:06.160
Okay, let's talk about this.

15:06.160 --> 15:10.240
There is an episode of Punky Brewster

15:10.240 --> 15:13.280
where a child is imprisoned in a refrigerator.

15:13.280 --> 15:15.920
And I think it isn't covered,

15:15.920 --> 15:18.240
but this must be a very weak child.

15:18.240 --> 15:22.320
I cannot fathom how you could get stuck in a refrigerator.

15:22.320 --> 15:23.520
Right, do they lock?

15:23.520 --> 15:26.720
Is that a thing where you were afraid of the meat getting out?

15:26.720 --> 15:29.760
No, they had those metal latches that would shut

15:29.760 --> 15:32.720
and would hold the door shut and they were only on the outside.

15:32.720 --> 15:35.440
So they'd have to remove the doors off these old refrigerators

15:35.440 --> 15:39.840
so dumb kids couldn't like crawl inside of them at the city dump.

15:39.840 --> 15:43.600
And then the good thing about that is ready to go

15:43.600 --> 15:46.240
hot and fresh coffin just like right there, I guess.

15:46.240 --> 15:48.320
And that's not ideal, obviously.

15:48.320 --> 15:51.840
But on the subject of if it is an ongoing concern,

15:51.840 --> 15:55.440
that would be wild knowing what I just said out loud.

15:55.440 --> 15:58.160
If Mr. Frigidaire like had people coming up to him,

15:58.160 --> 16:01.040
like, dog, you got to do something.

16:01.040 --> 16:03.200
The kids are climbing into, they're playing Fortnite

16:03.200 --> 16:06.160
and then going to take what they call dumpster breaks

16:06.160 --> 16:07.440
and they're climbing in the fridges

16:07.440 --> 16:10.480
and they are just getting just wrecked out there.

16:10.480 --> 16:12.240
And Mr. Frigidaire is not hearing that like,

16:15.280 --> 16:15.780
yes.

16:16.480 --> 16:19.600
Okay, so I've looked into this just to clarify,

16:19.600 --> 16:23.120
because we all have a vivid memory of this very special episode.

16:23.120 --> 16:27.040
The message of which was don't go in a refrigerator

16:27.040 --> 16:28.480
because you could get locked in, okay?

16:29.200 --> 16:31.440
This used to happen back when,

16:31.440 --> 16:34.320
because it used to be that you could only open from the outside.

16:34.320 --> 16:37.440
And then they made a law in 1956

16:38.320 --> 16:43.280
that you had to use the magnetic thing instead of a latch, right?

16:43.280 --> 16:46.640
So this punky Brewster episode released in the 80s

16:47.280 --> 16:51.920
was about the dangers of playing in antique refrigerators.

16:51.920 --> 16:55.600
That is like, hey, all the AIDS crisis was like in full bloom.

16:55.600 --> 16:57.280
Yeah, we had lots of stuff.

16:57.280 --> 16:59.520
Kids getting stuck in fridges.

17:00.160 --> 17:01.680
They was always stuck.

17:01.680 --> 17:03.600
Sorry, I'm just trying to think of how to update

17:03.600 --> 17:04.560
we didn't start the fire.

17:04.560 --> 17:07.200
Well, Trev, I don't think he does it in the chorus.

17:07.200 --> 17:09.360
I don't think he swaps out the chorus.

17:10.400 --> 17:14.240
It's like, let's really dig into the Berlin Wall.

17:17.280 --> 17:20.560
If I'm being honest, I couldn't remember how the verses go.

17:20.560 --> 17:23.840
It's just, it bothers me that it was a very special episode

17:23.840 --> 17:25.120
that I'm pretty sure I watched,

17:25.120 --> 17:27.600
but maybe I just know about because I exist in the world

17:27.600 --> 17:29.760
and I hear people talk about things sometimes.

17:29.760 --> 17:32.160
And that has stuck with me more than most lessons

17:32.160 --> 17:35.680
I learned in schools is that don't play in refrigerators.

17:35.680 --> 17:38.560
You get stuck in them, which is apparently a concern

17:38.560 --> 17:41.920
that not even my dad had to worry about when he was five.

17:42.560 --> 17:47.440
So why do I know it so well?

17:47.440 --> 17:48.480
Okay, that's it.

17:48.480 --> 17:50.320
You can look at, there's an article in Mental Floss

17:50.320 --> 17:52.480
if you want to know more about this very special episode

17:52.480 --> 17:55.520
that you're probably, I would imagine 98% of our audience

17:55.520 --> 17:56.720
is completely in the dark on.

17:57.760 --> 17:59.040
But hey, here we go.

18:00.160 --> 18:01.120
We're getting on their case.

18:01.120 --> 18:03.120
We're talking about the dangers of a 30-year-old thing.

18:03.120 --> 18:05.200
And here we are talking about a 30-year-old

18:05.200 --> 18:06.880
episode of television for comedy's sake.

18:06.880 --> 18:07.520
So moving on.

18:07.520 --> 18:08.560
Oh my God, you're right.

18:08.560 --> 18:09.280
I work in a hip-

18:09.280 --> 18:10.720
This podcast is a refrigerator

18:10.720 --> 18:12.720
that I've been trapped inside of for nine years.

18:14.160 --> 18:18.000
I work in a quote, hip office park

18:18.000 --> 18:21.280
and we share our parking lot with another hip company.

18:21.280 --> 18:22.480
They have their own coffee shop.

18:23.040 --> 18:26.480
In that parking lot, we also share a basketball hoop.

18:26.480 --> 18:28.400
A few weeks ago, we got a company-wide message

18:28.400 --> 18:29.360
that we needed to, quote,

18:29.360 --> 18:32.080
be respectful regarding the basketball hoop.

18:32.080 --> 18:33.280
Nothing further was said.

18:33.280 --> 18:34.880
Two weeks later, we get a second message

18:34.880 --> 18:37.360
saying that we were banned from using the hoop

18:37.360 --> 18:38.480
due to an incident.

18:39.200 --> 18:40.800
No one in my office is talking about it

18:40.800 --> 18:42.560
and I'm too scared to ask for fear of discovering

18:42.560 --> 18:44.560
some dark secret, what the incident was

18:44.560 --> 18:45.840
and why we were banned.

18:45.840 --> 18:47.200
The most I got from someone was,

18:47.200 --> 18:49.360
ooh, someone was a bad boy.

18:49.360 --> 18:50.960
How do I go about discovering the truth?

18:50.960 --> 18:52.240
Is it worth the risk?

18:52.240 --> 18:55.120
This is from Detective Hoops in Hotlanta.

18:55.120 --> 18:57.120
First, ooh, someone was a bad boy

18:57.120 --> 18:58.560
is not a piece of information

18:58.560 --> 19:00.800
but probably just a guess or observation.

19:00.800 --> 19:03.680
Like no one's ever like walked into a police office

19:03.680 --> 19:05.440
and then like a detective will say,

19:05.440 --> 19:06.400
what happened?

19:06.400 --> 19:07.360
And the detective's like,

19:07.360 --> 19:10.080
well, seems like somebody was a bad boy.

19:10.080 --> 19:10.960
What? No.

19:10.960 --> 19:12.800
You really cracked this one wide open, man.

19:15.040 --> 19:16.800
Someone was taking it to the-

19:16.800 --> 19:19.440
I mean, we are all agreed here.

19:19.440 --> 19:22.560
Someone was refusing to fake the funk on a nasty dunk

19:22.560 --> 19:24.000
and they were taking it to the hole.

19:24.000 --> 19:27.200
Yes, they were doing some disrespectful dunks.

19:27.200 --> 19:32.200
The other possibility is that they were doing nasty dunks

19:32.640 --> 19:34.880
but when it came time for the funk to happen,

19:34.880 --> 19:37.760
they were kind of phoning it in.

19:37.760 --> 19:39.120
They were kind of thinking off.

19:39.120 --> 19:41.200
And so it doesn't, you guys are assuming

19:41.200 --> 19:44.160
that somebody went boom shakalaka, the glass explode.

19:44.160 --> 19:47.760
I'm saying that maybe they were disrespecting the hoop

19:47.760 --> 19:51.840
by which I mean, they were doing super bad at basketball

19:51.840 --> 19:55.360
and embarrassing the sport itself, embarrassing the hoop.

19:55.360 --> 19:56.880
Like they would go to dunk

19:56.880 --> 19:58.640
but it was more just like they were barely

19:58.640 --> 20:00.320
like getting to the rim, you know?

20:00.320 --> 20:01.520
Like they're kind of rolling the ball

20:01.520 --> 20:03.040
off their fingers to get it in.

20:03.040 --> 20:06.240
And people were like, no, you can't do that.

20:06.240 --> 20:08.960
You're disrespecting the God of hoops.

20:08.960 --> 20:10.880
That was an impotent dunk, Jeremy.

20:11.840 --> 20:12.960
The folks over here-

20:12.960 --> 20:13.760
The folks over here-

20:13.760 --> 20:14.640
Funkier dunks.

20:14.640 --> 20:16.800
The folks over here at Slick Beans,

20:16.800 --> 20:18.480
the folks over here at Cool Coffee,

20:18.480 --> 20:20.640
they get nine feet high.

20:20.640 --> 20:21.200
They're so rad.

20:21.200 --> 20:23.600
Slick Beans is the name of the company

20:23.600 --> 20:26.240
but then Cool Coffee is the shop they have.

20:26.240 --> 20:27.200
Not related at all.

20:27.200 --> 20:30.800
Slick Beans does not handle actually any beans of any kind.

20:30.800 --> 20:32.160
It's just the name of the business.

20:32.160 --> 20:34.240
You're embarrassing us in front of Slick Beans.

20:34.240 --> 20:35.360
You're banned from the hoop.

20:35.360 --> 20:36.000
Everyone is.

20:36.880 --> 20:38.720
But I was trying my best.

20:41.600 --> 20:44.960
Maybe someone is playing a very high-minded game of D,

20:44.960 --> 20:46.480
of basketball day.

20:46.480 --> 20:47.280
Oh, I see.

20:47.280 --> 20:49.840
You're telling the other company that you're such a play

20:49.840 --> 20:50.400
that they-

20:50.400 --> 20:52.480
This is like high-level-

20:52.480 --> 20:54.480
There's like the zone defense.

20:54.480 --> 20:59.600
There's like sort of man-to-man sort of that defense.

20:59.600 --> 21:01.760
And then there's like emailing the opposing team

21:01.760 --> 21:04.000
to tell them that they're not welcome anywhere near the hoop.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.960
There's small business on small business defense, yeah.

21:06.960 --> 21:07.760
Uh-huh, yeah.

21:08.400 --> 21:09.280
That's our hoop.

21:09.280 --> 21:11.040
And we are formal-

21:11.040 --> 21:12.560
It's just taunting.

21:12.560 --> 21:15.360
We're just formally letting you all know that

21:15.360 --> 21:18.240
due to some disrespectful dunks,

21:18.240 --> 21:21.600
you are not allowed anywhere near our home,

21:21.600 --> 21:23.040
which is the hoop.

21:23.040 --> 21:26.160
You were dunking, but you didn't wash your hands first.

21:26.160 --> 21:27.120
And we saw that.

21:27.120 --> 21:28.640
So no, thank you.

21:28.640 --> 21:29.440
I don't wanna dunk with no-

21:29.440 --> 21:30.640
The ball was teetering on the rim

21:30.640 --> 21:33.600
and you burped and blew on it to push the ball into it.

21:33.600 --> 21:34.560
No, thank you.

21:34.560 --> 21:36.320
I don't wanna dunk with no pee ball.

21:38.320 --> 21:40.480
We saw Derek come out of the bathroom

21:40.480 --> 21:43.120
without washing his hands and then go straight

21:43.120 --> 21:45.520
to the parking lot and start dribbling.

21:45.520 --> 21:46.800
No, thank you.

21:46.800 --> 21:49.520
For all we know, he's already dribbled twice.

21:49.520 --> 21:50.320
Yeah.

21:50.320 --> 21:54.160
Maybe one company, like whoever,

21:54.160 --> 21:57.440
the TJ Maxx staff challenged-

21:57.440 --> 21:58.880
That's a pretty hit business, Justin.

21:58.880 --> 22:00.000
That's a hit business.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.720
The TJ Maxx staff challenged Cool Beans

22:02.720 --> 22:05.280
to a basketball showdown.

22:05.280 --> 22:07.360
And then they told them that that was their hoop

22:07.360 --> 22:09.120
and then that the other team didn't have a hoop

22:09.120 --> 22:10.400
because there was only one hoop.

22:10.400 --> 22:13.680
So the only hoop available was the Cool Beans hoop.

22:13.680 --> 22:16.800
So then the score just got absolutely astronomically

22:16.800 --> 22:19.760
out of reach and there was no more basketball

22:19.760 --> 22:20.400
out because of that.

22:20.400 --> 22:23.360
And another possibility is that in an attempt

22:23.360 --> 22:25.120
to get a leg up on the slick beans,

22:25.120 --> 22:27.280
some select members of your staff,

22:27.280 --> 22:28.960
your coworkers, your cohorts,

22:28.960 --> 22:32.240
did go out and steal the basketball energy

22:32.240 --> 22:36.640
from Muggsy Bulgs and Charles Barkley

22:36.640 --> 22:40.320
and Michael Jordan, although he's playing baseball.

22:40.320 --> 22:42.560
So like, does he even still have it?

22:42.560 --> 22:47.760
And Sylvester Stallone, I mean Sylvester the cat.

22:48.400 --> 22:51.520
And Sylvester Stallone.

22:51.520 --> 22:53.120
He voiced Sylvester the cat.

22:53.920 --> 22:56.000
He's just known, he's got big,

22:56.000 --> 23:00.000
hey, listen, Sly, fucking Rocky,

23:00.000 --> 23:01.360
he's got huge muscles.

23:01.360 --> 23:02.880
That's gotta help you jump, yeah?

23:03.920 --> 23:05.600
Well, is it?

23:05.600 --> 23:07.920
Actually, I was gonna say he didn't do any jumping,

23:07.920 --> 23:10.080
but he jumps up and down when he gets to the top

23:10.080 --> 23:11.760
of the steps and it's pretty good.

23:11.760 --> 23:14.080
It's got big muscles on his legs to push the earth away

23:14.080 --> 23:15.520
to get up to the hoop, so.

23:15.520 --> 23:18.960
Is it a problem that none of us have even theorized

23:18.960 --> 23:20.720
about Flubber at this point?

23:20.720 --> 23:21.360
Oh shit.

23:21.360 --> 23:24.240
Should Flubber have been brought up before now?

23:24.240 --> 23:32.080
Maybe the hip company is like a Flubber company.

23:32.080 --> 23:33.440
It's a new Flubber company.

23:33.440 --> 23:36.480
It's a new, the new Flubber company they call it.

23:36.480 --> 23:39.360
I'm so sick of it being so,

23:39.360 --> 23:42.480
this market is flooded with Flubber companies.

23:42.480 --> 23:44.800
There's just like a new one every day.

23:44.800 --> 23:45.440
They're doing it.

23:45.440 --> 23:46.640
This is a new take.

23:46.640 --> 23:50.080
It's like organic fair trade Flubber.

23:50.080 --> 23:51.360
Farm to table Flubber.

23:51.360 --> 23:53.040
Keto genic Flubber.

23:53.040 --> 23:54.240
Basketball shoe Flubber.

23:56.000 --> 23:59.680
To avoid FDA prying eyes,

23:59.680 --> 24:02.160
they have to call their company something else

24:02.160 --> 24:05.680
as a front and so they do Apple.

24:06.960 --> 24:07.520
And that's how,

24:07.520 --> 24:09.200
that's what they've actually been this whole time.

24:10.160 --> 24:12.880
Yeah, so I've got a whole dossier

24:12.880 --> 24:14.720
and I've sent it to Justin and Travis

24:14.720 --> 24:17.200
many, many times before about how Apple does Flubber.

24:17.200 --> 24:19.280
I'm gonna crack it open soon, bud.

24:19.280 --> 24:19.840
I promise.

24:19.840 --> 24:21.280
For your birthday, maybe that's our.

24:22.400 --> 24:25.520
Is it possible that you work for the Harlem Globetrotters?

24:26.560 --> 24:27.060
Huh.

24:28.720 --> 24:31.040
I mean, they have to have a storefront somewhere.

24:31.040 --> 24:33.760
You can't be a business without a storefront legally.

24:33.760 --> 24:34.480
I do.

24:34.480 --> 24:36.960
I'm going to step in here though and say

24:38.160 --> 24:43.280
I cannot think of a conglomeration

24:43.280 --> 24:47.600
that altogether throughout the history of time

24:47.600 --> 24:50.560
has been more disrespectful to the basketball hoop

24:50.560 --> 24:52.880
and the game itself and the people they play it.

24:52.880 --> 24:55.440
They will climb up on ladders and they will dunk,

24:55.440 --> 24:57.200
you know, confetti into the audience

24:57.200 --> 25:01.680
while another person scores a three from the concession stand.

25:01.680 --> 25:04.320
That is hugely disrespectful to this game.

25:04.320 --> 25:05.120
It's cheating.

25:05.120 --> 25:05.680
Yes.

25:05.680 --> 25:06.720
It is cheating.

25:07.440 --> 25:10.000
How come no one has called the Harlem Globetrotters

25:10.000 --> 25:11.680
on their flagrant cheating?

25:12.800 --> 25:15.120
They do a basketball jump over like five kids

25:15.760 --> 25:21.600
and I just, I didn't see my friend Michael Jordan

25:21.600 --> 25:23.840
doing that during his big game,

25:23.840 --> 25:26.560
the sixth game of the series that he did so well in.

25:26.560 --> 25:27.840
So I don't know.

25:28.400 --> 25:30.560
One time I saw a Harlem Globetrotter

25:30.560 --> 25:32.720
put the ball under his jersey

25:33.440 --> 25:36.240
and then pretend he was pregnant and walk with it.

25:37.040 --> 25:38.080
The junior.

25:38.080 --> 25:41.680
And at no point did anyone say you're not dribbling.

25:41.680 --> 25:43.680
You can't put the ball under your shirt.

25:43.680 --> 25:44.880
They just let him do it.

25:44.880 --> 25:47.040
But then he said, oh, aren't I?

25:47.040 --> 25:51.440
And then his water broke and then they brought out a bed

25:51.440 --> 25:53.280
and then over the next 12 hours,

25:53.280 --> 26:02.480
he pushed that basketball valiantly, slowly, bravely.

26:02.480 --> 26:03.520
No epidural.

26:03.520 --> 26:06.400
No epidural, just raw dogging it.

26:06.400 --> 26:07.600
There was an epiduncle.

26:09.680 --> 26:12.160
Which is of course a basketball doula.

26:12.160 --> 26:16.160
Yeah, and so it's just no juice, just raw dogging it.

26:16.160 --> 26:19.360
And then when it did come out, it was a three pointer.

26:20.480 --> 26:22.720
Extremely disrespectful display.

26:22.720 --> 26:25.520
Extremely disrespectful, but also beautiful.

26:25.520 --> 26:27.200
But also it was beautiful.

26:27.200 --> 26:28.640
It was beautiful, beautiful.

26:28.640 --> 26:30.960
Yeah, it was beautiful little slice of life

26:30.960 --> 26:33.360
and it's the circle of life and that's great,

26:33.360 --> 26:36.720
but you got placent on the basketball

26:36.720 --> 26:39.920
and that's disrespectful because that one's cashed.

26:39.920 --> 26:42.240
I don't mean to be, I'm not a brood.

26:42.240 --> 26:46.480
I've seen the majesty of this process IRL firsthand

26:46.480 --> 26:47.760
with my own special brood.

26:47.760 --> 26:50.560
But if you get placent on a basketball, boy.

26:50.560 --> 26:52.560
Because the little bumps on there, forget about it.

26:52.560 --> 26:53.760
That one's done.

26:55.920 --> 26:57.840
You know the Harlem Globetrotters play against?

26:58.560 --> 27:00.480
The Washington Generals.

27:01.440 --> 27:04.960
Yeah, well now here I am thinking this.

27:07.200 --> 27:13.520
Does Flover have a placenta component in it?

27:13.520 --> 27:15.840
That's why you're supposed to save the placenta

27:15.840 --> 27:17.440
because they need it for Flover.

27:17.440 --> 27:24.800
So they will pay top dollar for some fresh placenta.

27:24.800 --> 27:26.320
Hey, quick.

27:26.320 --> 27:28.400
It's just placenta and cornstarch really.

27:31.760 --> 27:32.880
You can DIY.

27:33.520 --> 27:35.360
I watch a lot of YouTube videos.

27:35.360 --> 27:36.480
DIY Flover.

27:37.280 --> 27:39.440
Now you're gonna need some fresh placenta.

27:39.440 --> 27:41.520
Nothing freeze-dried, no powdered.

27:42.480 --> 27:46.880
I'm talking about fresh, just fresh out the Harlem Globetrotter.

27:46.880 --> 27:47.680
Just right out.

27:50.080 --> 27:51.520
You know, on any other show,

27:52.640 --> 27:54.880
on any other episode of My Brother, My Brother, Me,

27:54.880 --> 27:57.840
the news that the Washington Generals have their own website

27:58.400 --> 28:00.640
touting what a great season they're gonna have

28:00.640 --> 28:03.760
and their all-new roster would be worth discussing.

28:03.760 --> 28:05.920
But I don't even know if it's...

28:05.920 --> 28:08.320
Okay, it is worth mentioning this.

28:12.960 --> 28:15.840
Oh man, this is gonna be a basketball-themed episode

28:15.840 --> 28:16.880
of My Brother, My Brother, Me

28:16.880 --> 28:19.360
because we are going to have to discuss this currently.

28:19.360 --> 28:25.600
I want everyone to just join me over here at this webpage.

28:25.600 --> 28:27.200
If you're at home and you want to see

28:27.200 --> 28:29.200
what my brothers are about to laugh at,

28:29.200 --> 28:32.240
go to washingtongenerals.com forward slash Cager.

28:32.240 --> 28:33.520
That's C-A-G-E-R.

28:34.320 --> 28:37.920
You're gonna meet Cager, the Globetrotter's biggest nightmare.

28:38.800 --> 28:40.720
Oh my god.

28:40.720 --> 28:49.680
Yeah, this image is a very tall man in a black hoodie

28:50.560 --> 28:54.160
with arms open in almost sort of a biblical pose

28:54.160 --> 29:00.160
and he's most notably wearing a sort of black basketball mask.

29:00.880 --> 29:02.640
There's a quote here from Cager.

29:02.640 --> 29:07.440
We're like edging into Munch Squad territory.

29:07.440 --> 29:10.400
Quote, I don't like the way the Globetrotters

29:10.400 --> 29:13.040
are always joking around and laughing on the court.

29:13.040 --> 29:17.200
Basketball a serious business, says Cager with a scowl.

29:18.400 --> 29:20.240
I am ready to release the beast

29:20.240 --> 29:23.280
and show how basketball is supposed to be played.

29:23.280 --> 29:25.920
I'm going to wreck some rims and wreck some dreams.

29:25.920 --> 29:26.720
Hold on, Cager.

29:26.720 --> 29:27.840
Hold on there, Cager.

29:27.840 --> 29:28.880
Pump the brakes there, Cager,

29:28.880 --> 29:32.080
because I'm all about you showing the Harlem Globetrotters

29:32.080 --> 29:33.920
that the way that they treat the basketball

29:33.920 --> 29:36.160
and the sport is somewhat disrespectful,

29:36.160 --> 29:39.760
but you got to leave those rims for the next generation.

29:39.760 --> 29:42.320
So I appreciate where you're coming from,

29:42.320 --> 29:45.280
but you need to not become the thing

29:45.280 --> 29:47.520
that you are trying to fight in this world.

29:47.520 --> 29:50.720
Now it says here in this Cager article

29:51.920 --> 29:55.120
that he can drill shots from the four point line

29:55.760 --> 30:00.000
introduced by the Globetrotters in 2016.

30:00.000 --> 30:01.520
So the Globetrotters are just like,

30:01.520 --> 30:04.480
hey, from now on this line, you get four points.

30:04.480 --> 30:08.160
It's disrespectful in ways that I couldn't even imagine.

30:09.360 --> 30:10.960
Meanwhile, the Washington generals say,

30:10.960 --> 30:12.880
okay, we have a seven foot guy.

30:12.880 --> 30:16.720
We brought a giant in a black rask and he's fighting for us.

30:16.720 --> 30:19.360
And there is a quote here from the coach of that team,

30:19.360 --> 30:23.600
which is maybe the most thankless position in all of sport.

30:24.240 --> 30:27.200
Quote, we might even sneak a six player on the court

30:27.200 --> 30:28.720
when Cager is in the game.

30:28.720 --> 30:30.640
The guy can just hide behind Cager

30:30.640 --> 30:32.000
and the rest will never see him.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.160
Now I don't fucking care who wins.

30:34.160 --> 30:38.240
Let them destroy each other and I'll mop up whoever's left.

30:38.240 --> 30:40.480
You can't sink to their level, Cager.

30:42.960 --> 30:44.560
Cager closes with this.

30:44.560 --> 30:47.680
He menses no words when asked about his objective.

30:47.680 --> 30:50.560
My main purpose in life is to get the generals

30:50.560 --> 30:53.280
that elusive win and wipe the smiles

30:53.280 --> 30:55.760
off the faces of the Globetrotters.

30:55.760 --> 30:58.640
Y'all, I looked it up just to find out

30:59.600 --> 31:02.240
that Washington generals have beaten

31:02.240 --> 31:06.560
the Harlem Globetrotters at least three times.

31:06.560 --> 31:07.600
Oh my God.

31:07.600 --> 31:11.920
In 1954, 1958, and 1971.

31:13.120 --> 31:15.920
I mean, it has to be a revolt

31:15.920 --> 31:18.000
from one of the Washington generals

31:18.000 --> 31:19.600
who was summarily fired after that,

31:19.600 --> 31:21.200
but this is a way to fucking go out.

31:21.200 --> 31:23.440
Like, oh no, oh no, he's got a ladder.

31:24.240 --> 31:24.720
Swish!

31:24.720 --> 31:26.320
What are you fucking doing, Ronnie?

31:26.880 --> 31:29.040
What are you fucking doing, Ronnie?

31:29.040 --> 31:31.040
I don't want to be there though on the day

31:31.040 --> 31:33.120
when Cager does get his elusive dream

31:33.120 --> 31:35.680
of destroying the Harlem Globetrotters

31:35.680 --> 31:36.720
because he wins that game.

31:36.720 --> 31:37.920
They come back the next day.

31:37.920 --> 31:39.520
Globetrotters are like, guess what?

31:39.520 --> 31:41.520
We've all got Civil War sabers.

31:41.520 --> 31:43.680
We all took a vote on basketball rules

31:43.680 --> 31:45.600
and now we've all got swords.

31:45.600 --> 31:48.640
We voted that it's legal on the court to kill Cager.

31:48.640 --> 31:50.720
Yeah, if I can cut Cager's whole head off,

31:50.720 --> 31:51.920
I get 20 points.

31:52.720 --> 31:55.120
We're dangling Cager's beloved uncle

31:56.080 --> 31:58.560
from a rope from the rafters of the stadium.

31:58.560 --> 32:03.040
And if the Generals win, we'll drop and kill his uncle.

32:03.040 --> 32:07.600
And that's a new basketball rule we came up with.

32:07.600 --> 32:09.200
And the NBA sees the NBA.

32:09.200 --> 32:10.720
Tickets are starting to slow down.

32:10.720 --> 32:13.040
Tickets to the Harlem Globetrotters games

32:13.040 --> 32:14.000
are just going through the roof,

32:14.000 --> 32:16.400
so now the NBA's got to start dangling uncles.

32:17.120 --> 32:18.000
Oh, gosh.

32:20.160 --> 32:21.120
Should we go to the Money Zone?

32:21.120 --> 32:28.800
Yeah, yeah, let's go.

32:33.680 --> 32:35.360
Oh my God, we have a new sponsor.

32:35.360 --> 32:39.680
I'm so extremely excited to talk about Postmates.

32:40.320 --> 32:44.320
Okay, so who do you ask to bring you something

32:44.320 --> 32:45.680
when you don't want to leave the house?

32:46.960 --> 32:50.000
You could ask your friends, but how many of those can you call?

32:50.000 --> 32:52.480
Griffin will drive up from Austin, no problem.

32:53.120 --> 32:56.560
No more of that relying on brotherly affection.

32:56.560 --> 32:58.320
Just use Postmates.

32:58.320 --> 32:59.920
Oh, it's no problem.

33:00.560 --> 33:01.920
I know it's no problem for you, Griffin,

33:01.920 --> 33:03.520
but it is your birthday, so if you need a day off,

33:03.520 --> 33:04.560
here's Postmates.

33:04.560 --> 33:06.960
It's your personal food delivery, grocery delivery,

33:06.960 --> 33:09.440
whatever you could think of, delivery service 24-7.

33:09.440 --> 33:10.640
You don't have to go to the store.

33:10.640 --> 33:13.040
You can just download the app for iOS and Android for free,

33:13.920 --> 33:16.000
browse local restaurants, and track your delivery.

33:16.000 --> 33:19.360
They're the largest on-demand network in the known universe

33:19.360 --> 33:22.480
with more than 25,000 partner merchants.

33:23.200 --> 33:25.200
For a limited time, Postmates is giving our listeners

33:25.200 --> 33:29.120
$100 of free delivery credit for your first seven days,

33:30.560 --> 33:32.320
and you can start those free deliveries right now

33:32.320 --> 33:36.400
and just get the app and use the code MYBROTHER.

33:36.400 --> 33:37.200
I love Postmates.

33:37.200 --> 33:39.920
You know what I love Postmates is when we're on tour

33:39.920 --> 33:41.600
and I don't know the area very well,

33:41.600 --> 33:43.920
so if you're traveling and you just need something

33:43.920 --> 33:46.640
and you don't know how far away that something is

33:46.640 --> 33:49.920
or where the place is or whatever, Postmates

33:49.920 --> 33:52.000
is like a fantastic option for that.

33:52.000 --> 33:55.040
Yeah, I apologize for laughing in the middle of that.

33:55.040 --> 33:58.000
That was a time release, half hour long delay

33:58.880 --> 34:01.120
from me realizing that my brother Travis

34:01.120 --> 34:04.400
had essentially sent a bidet to a stranger here in Austin,

34:04.400 --> 34:06.160
and I enjoy that very much.

34:07.680 --> 34:10.560
Again, get the app right now and then use the code MYBROTHER

34:10.560 --> 34:13.840

I would like to tell you about Bull and Branch.

34:22.560 --> 34:27.600
Bull and Branch, sheets, towels, what do you need?

34:27.600 --> 34:28.800
What do you need?

34:28.800 --> 34:30.240
Go to Bull and Branch.

34:30.240 --> 34:33.520
I just did a big old round of laundry

34:33.520 --> 34:35.760
and I had, this is not a joke

34:35.760 --> 34:39.440
because I notice things like this, gosh darn it.

34:39.440 --> 34:41.680
I was folding some Bull and Branch towels

34:41.680 --> 34:44.480
and I thought these still feel brand new

34:44.480 --> 34:46.720
even though I've had them for like a year.

34:46.720 --> 34:49.440
And that's just a testament to the quality

34:49.440 --> 34:50.800
that Bull and Branch brings

34:50.800 --> 34:54.000
because they use 100% pure organic cotton

34:54.640 --> 34:57.600
and it's signature soft sheets that start out luxurious

34:57.600 --> 35:02.160
and only get softer over time, which I can 100% vouch for.

35:02.160 --> 35:06.560
And Bull and Branch products have thousands of five-star reviews.

35:07.120 --> 35:08.160
It's incredible.

35:08.160 --> 35:10.480
I'm a big fan, highly recommend.

35:10.480 --> 35:12.480
People are at the heart of everything they do

35:12.480 --> 35:14.400
from farmers who grow their organic cotton

35:14.400 --> 35:16.320
to the people who sleep on their feet at night.

35:16.960 --> 35:17.760
All right.

35:17.760 --> 35:19.760
And they offer a no risk 30-day trial

35:19.760 --> 35:21.440
and free shipping in the US.

35:42.720 --> 35:46.560
The Greatest Generation is a Star Trek podcast

35:46.560 --> 35:51.200
that de-stigmatizes the very idea of having a Star Trek podcast.

35:52.240 --> 35:55.200
We're Ben and Adam, the hosts of The Greatest Generation

35:55.200 --> 35:57.040
and the technology we've developed is that

35:57.040 --> 36:00.000
nobody knows what you're playing in your earbuds.

36:00.000 --> 36:02.720
You know, with legalization, it's easier than ever

36:02.720 --> 36:04.160
to find out what's in your buds.

36:04.160 --> 36:09.200
But we suggest that you legally find The Greatest Generation

36:09.200 --> 36:11.360
wherever you download your podcasts.

36:11.360 --> 36:14.240
We'll send it to you in a discreet, unmarked package

36:15.360 --> 36:17.280
and nobody has to know but us.

36:17.280 --> 36:19.040
That's The Greatest Generation,

36:19.040 --> 36:22.320
the Star Trek podcast that you didn't know you needed

36:22.320 --> 36:24.160
yet makes you feel like you belong.

36:25.520 --> 36:27.120
So y'all want another yahoo?

36:28.800 --> 36:29.360
I felt that one.

36:29.360 --> 36:31.440
Yes, Griff and I would like another yahoo.

36:31.440 --> 36:34.080
All right, this yahoo was sent in by Graham Robach.

36:34.080 --> 36:34.720
Thank you, Graham.

36:34.720 --> 36:38.320
Oh, and well, I love-

36:38.320 --> 36:41.840
Stone asks, and this one's really fucking funny.

36:41.840 --> 36:44.000
This one's really gonna bust guts and nuts

36:44.000 --> 36:45.520
in the audience tonight.

36:45.520 --> 36:47.200
This one's gonna bust a nut?

36:47.200 --> 36:48.480
It's guts and nuts.

36:50.160 --> 36:53.840
This one is so funny, it would lay low even the big man, Cager.

36:53.840 --> 37:03.840
Oh, Korn's here.

37:03.840 --> 37:05.120
I want a munch.

37:13.120 --> 37:15.600
Welcome to Munch Squad, the podcast within a podcast

37:15.600 --> 37:21.520
that I feel like is in its twilight years.

37:21.520 --> 37:24.240
I feel like, and not to be sad, and there's still plenty

37:24.240 --> 37:25.200
of Munch Squad on the horizon,

37:25.200 --> 37:27.360
but I feel like we're probably rounding the bin

37:27.360 --> 37:28.880
on people being so buck wild.

37:28.880 --> 37:31.520
I'm not gonna say it has anything to do with Munch Squad,

37:31.520 --> 37:34.160
but I'm not gonna say that I did not kill

37:34.160 --> 37:35.600
this particular golden goose.

37:35.600 --> 37:37.920
But we've still got a few left in us

37:37.920 --> 37:39.680
and I just wanna bring it home strong.

37:39.680 --> 37:42.000
I do wanna give everybody real quick

37:42.000 --> 37:44.080
a quick Munch Squad Jr. with the update.

37:45.200 --> 37:46.160
Welcome to the family.

37:46.160 --> 37:51.600
Carl's Jr. testing a CBD burger in Denver on 420.

37:52.160 --> 37:53.600
First ever quick service restaurants

37:53.600 --> 37:55.840
to introduce CBD infused item.

37:56.800 --> 38:00.320
It's named the Rocky Mountain High Cheeseburger Delight.

38:00.320 --> 38:02.800
And that is the CBD there.

38:03.920 --> 38:06.800
It features two charbroil patties

38:06.800 --> 38:10.000
with the signature Santa Fe sauce infused with CBD.

38:10.800 --> 38:12.720
Pickled jalapenos, pepper jack cheese,

38:12.720 --> 38:15.040
and crisp cut fries right on there

38:15.040 --> 38:16.720
to give the burger the extra crunch.

38:16.720 --> 38:18.960
That's easily the weirdest part of the whole burger,

38:18.960 --> 38:19.280
I would say.

38:19.280 --> 38:20.720
That's the weirdest part of it.

38:20.720 --> 38:21.520
Listen to this.

38:21.520 --> 38:23.200
The new menu item will be available

38:23.200 --> 38:26.480
at 4050 Colorado Boulevard, Denver on April 20th.

38:26.480 --> 38:28.080
Yes, that's right, 420.

38:28.080 --> 38:29.760
Beginning at 6 a.m.

38:30.800 --> 38:34.640
Hey, hey, how's the morning going?

38:35.200 --> 38:36.160
Pretty good.

38:36.160 --> 38:42.880
I just ate a weed hamburger at 630 a.m.

38:42.880 --> 38:44.800
So I feel like the day's off to a good start.

38:44.800 --> 38:46.880
But that's not what I want to talk about today.

38:46.880 --> 38:50.000
I want to, I got big news from DQ.

38:50.000 --> 38:52.400
They've just unveiled a new tagline.

38:53.040 --> 38:54.960
Oh no, that's the worst,

38:54.960 --> 38:57.440
that's the worst thing they could have been unveiling.

38:58.240 --> 39:00.640
Yeah, they're unveiling a new tagline.

39:00.640 --> 39:01.200
Here it comes.

39:01.200 --> 39:01.600
You ready?

39:03.040 --> 39:03.840
Happy take good.

39:05.280 --> 39:06.960
Oh my God, it's already really great.

39:07.760 --> 39:08.720
Happy tastes good.

39:08.720 --> 39:13.600
Huh, happy tastes good.

39:15.200 --> 39:16.320
Good happy taste.

39:19.520 --> 39:21.600
I guess daddy like was taken.

39:21.600 --> 39:22.640
So now we got it.

39:22.640 --> 39:23.600
Happy tastes good.

39:24.400 --> 39:27.360
The cakes and creams taste happy and good.

39:28.960 --> 39:29.760
Happy tastes good.

39:31.600 --> 39:32.720
Good taste?

39:32.720 --> 39:35.200
No, happy tastes good, end of slogan.

39:35.200 --> 39:36.160
Happy tastes good.

39:36.160 --> 39:39.840
With fresh deals, sweet new treats and crave worthy eats

39:39.840 --> 39:43.440
that make any meal feel like an indulgence because it is.

39:44.000 --> 39:45.840
I mean, folks, you're eating a Dairy Queen.

39:45.840 --> 39:47.520
It is an indulgence of a sort.

39:48.560 --> 39:51.600
It is reinforcing that it's a smile above the rest

39:51.600 --> 39:54.800
and a destination for happy moments and memories

39:54.800 --> 39:58.880
and diarrhea later presumably to celebrate happy tastes good.

40:00.000 --> 40:01.600
It's great every time.

40:01.600 --> 40:03.200
What a great sentence.

40:03.200 --> 40:08.080
Someone was paid for, there's new Sunday toppings

40:08.080 --> 40:13.280
like rich Choco Chunks, crunchy praline pieces and smooth.

40:13.280 --> 40:17.360
I swear to God, it's called this smooth midnight fudge.

40:18.880 --> 40:19.840
Oh my God.

40:19.840 --> 40:25.360
A little bit of that midnight fudge, a midnight fudge.

40:27.840 --> 40:29.600
So they got a deal.

40:29.600 --> 40:34.080
And Maria Hockenson, who's this something there,

40:34.080 --> 40:36.800
says, we love being at the center of our fans'

40:36.800 --> 40:38.080
happiest memories.

40:38.080 --> 40:40.160
The center of my happiest memory?

40:40.160 --> 40:42.480
Why, it's a meal at Dairy Queen.

40:43.280 --> 40:46.640
Whether it's toasting to a team win, celebrating a birthday

40:46.640 --> 40:49.360
or simply treating yourself to make the every day

40:49.360 --> 40:50.560
just a little more special.

40:51.200 --> 40:51.760
Fuck, man.

40:52.320 --> 40:55.040
I just thought of somebody that tried to make a boring day

40:55.040 --> 40:57.360
more special by eating a Dairy Queen

40:57.360 --> 40:59.920
and it's the most depressing thing I've ever heard

40:59.920 --> 41:02.480
in my entire life, but happy tastes good.

41:03.360 --> 41:05.760
It's about the joyful moments you experience

41:05.760 --> 41:07.760
when you visit one of our restaurants

41:07.760 --> 41:10.480
from the first bite to the last spoonful.

41:10.480 --> 41:12.240
The last spoonful here is either the last spoonful

41:12.240 --> 41:15.120
of your food or the last spoonful before you realize

41:15.120 --> 41:16.880
that you only have the one human body

41:16.880 --> 41:19.120
and what are you doing to it and you have to go.

41:19.120 --> 41:20.880
Now here's the wildest part about this release.

41:21.680 --> 41:25.360
To prove the DQ brand really is in the business of happy.

41:25.360 --> 41:29.680
ADQ, that's American Dairy Queen Network, I guess,

41:29.680 --> 41:33.440
commissioned a national consumer survey, which found that.

41:33.440 --> 41:37.760
Okay, by the way, if you want to preserve numbers

41:37.760 --> 41:40.240
as something that, and statistics as something

41:40.240 --> 41:42.480
of a constant in your life that you rely on

41:42.480 --> 41:44.800
to become more informed or that you find any use

41:44.800 --> 41:48.160
or value in them, please stop listening now

41:48.160 --> 41:50.240
because Dairy Queen is about to strip that away.

41:50.240 --> 41:54.800
69% of the people surveyed believe that

41:54.800 --> 41:58.720
having a Blizzard treat is a happier way

41:58.720 --> 42:01.360
to start the summer than activities

42:01.360 --> 42:04.320
such as taking a road trip, 43%,

42:04.320 --> 42:09.440
wearing shorts, 40%, or cannonballing into a pool, 29%.

42:09.440 --> 42:10.880
Oh my God.

42:10.880 --> 42:13.920
What was the structure of the question asked?

42:13.920 --> 42:17.600
What is the structure of that fucking question?

42:17.600 --> 42:21.600
Because one, I added all your numbers and you're fucked.

42:21.600 --> 42:24.400
It's all fucked straight to death.

42:24.400 --> 42:25.760
Okay, that's all fucked.

42:28.080 --> 42:31.280
69% of people believe that having a Blizzard treat

42:31.280 --> 42:33.360
is a happier way to start the summer

42:33.360 --> 42:35.200
than wearing shorts.

42:35.200 --> 42:36.640
Did you just ask people like,

42:36.640 --> 42:39.200
would you rather have some ice cream

42:39.200 --> 42:41.840
or put on some shorts right now?

42:41.840 --> 42:43.920
What would be a happier start to your summer?

42:43.920 --> 42:48.160
Eating ice cream in slacks or wearing shorts?

42:48.160 --> 42:50.000
I imagine they only asked 10 people.

42:51.040 --> 42:52.560
What's a better way to start your summer?

42:52.560 --> 42:54.800
Eating a cool, refreshing Blizzard treat

42:54.800 --> 42:57.280
at Dairy Queen's, smiles taste good,

42:57.280 --> 43:00.160
or wearing some fucking shorts?

43:00.160 --> 43:01.760
Is that a good way to start your summer?

43:01.760 --> 43:04.880
And four people went shorts, I guess,

43:04.880 --> 43:07.680
and the other six people went rightly so.

43:07.680 --> 43:09.680
What the fuck are you talking about?

43:09.680 --> 43:10.880
Time to pull on my shorts.

43:10.880 --> 43:14.240
Ah, it's June 23rd, let's go.

43:14.240 --> 43:16.320
You can't put on shorts.

43:17.280 --> 43:18.560
Okay, these people who said,

43:18.560 --> 43:20.160
okay, of all those, I think the best start

43:20.160 --> 43:21.840
is cannonballing into a pool.

43:21.840 --> 43:24.320
Cool, are you doing that in slacks?

43:24.320 --> 43:26.960
Are you wearing jeans and cannonballing into the pool?

43:26.960 --> 43:28.240
No, you're not.

43:29.840 --> 43:33.200
Maybe they literally held up a Blizzard

43:33.200 --> 43:34.560
and said, do you wanna eat this?

43:34.560 --> 43:36.000
And then they held up a pair of shorts

43:36.000 --> 43:38.160
and said, or do you wanna put on my shorts?

43:38.160 --> 43:40.720
And we were like, I guess I'll eat the Blizzard.

43:40.720 --> 43:41.600
I thought so.

43:41.600 --> 43:44.400
Do you wanna take off your clothes right now

43:44.400 --> 43:47.280
in front of everyone here in Times Square

43:47.280 --> 43:48.480
and put on these shorts?

43:48.480 --> 43:51.440
Or would you rather have this refreshing Blizzard treat

43:51.440 --> 43:52.400
and guess what?

43:52.400 --> 43:53.760
I'm gonna one up that shit.

43:53.760 --> 43:56.400
It's covered in smooth midnight fudge.

43:56.400 --> 43:57.840
Can I do neither?

43:58.800 --> 44:03.680
All right, how about you eat this or I push you into a pool?

44:06.000 --> 44:07.120
Please don't do that.

44:07.120 --> 44:09.200
Or I'm gonna put you in the trunk of this car

44:09.200 --> 44:10.880
and drive you across the country.

44:11.440 --> 44:12.480
Please don't do that.

44:13.040 --> 44:13.540
I'm not done.

44:14.720 --> 44:16.080
Okay, listen.

44:16.080 --> 44:20.960
56% said dipping a DQ chicken strip into sauce

44:20.960 --> 44:23.440
feels like a group hug for your taste buds.

44:23.440 --> 44:23.940
Wow.

44:26.560 --> 44:27.600
No, they didn't.

44:27.600 --> 44:29.680
They checked a box next to that sentence

44:29.680 --> 44:31.280
that Dairy Queen wrote.

44:31.280 --> 44:33.760
Yeah, but that means that 44% of the people

44:33.760 --> 44:36.240
just stared at the question asker in silence.

44:36.240 --> 44:38.000
Like, what could that mean?

44:38.000 --> 44:38.500
What?

44:38.500 --> 44:40.160
What could that possibly mean?

44:40.160 --> 44:41.760
Trump is president.

44:41.760 --> 44:43.280
What are you talking about?

44:43.280 --> 44:45.280
There's real things.

44:45.280 --> 44:47.360
Real things going on in the world.

44:47.360 --> 44:49.120
You're wasting my time.

44:49.120 --> 44:50.960
What on earth are you talking about?

44:50.960 --> 44:52.480
The last statistic they have here.

44:53.920 --> 44:58.720
53% said a trip to a DQ location

44:59.280 --> 45:02.960
is as happy as finding $20 in your pocket.

45:02.960 --> 45:03.460
Wrong.

45:04.560 --> 45:06.880
What on earth could that mean?

45:08.720 --> 45:12.160
If you find the $20, you could go to Dairy Queen with it.

45:12.160 --> 45:12.720
Yeah.

45:12.720 --> 45:13.760
What on earth?

45:13.760 --> 45:16.320
What on earth do you mean?

45:16.320 --> 45:18.640
The cycle begins anew.

45:18.640 --> 45:20.240
History repeats itself.

45:21.120 --> 45:21.760
Apparently.

45:22.560 --> 45:23.760
How about a Yahoo?

45:23.760 --> 45:24.160
Yeah, please.

45:24.160 --> 45:25.280
This one's sent in by Graham Robock.

45:25.280 --> 45:25.760
Thank you, Graham.

45:25.760 --> 45:29.920
It's from Yahoo Answers user Stone, who asks,

45:31.120 --> 45:33.120
spiders in my house?

45:33.680 --> 45:34.480
How get rid of?

45:35.040 --> 45:36.000
Like Minecraft?

45:39.840 --> 45:41.520
Spiders in my house?

45:41.520 --> 45:42.560
How get rid of?

45:42.560 --> 45:44.560
Like Minecraft?

45:44.560 --> 45:46.480
You're gonna have to bring your house down.

45:46.480 --> 45:49.440
Well, I mean, maybe that's what Yahoo Answers user Jehera

45:49.440 --> 45:52.240
meant when they responded, put torches.

45:54.320 --> 45:55.360
End of comment.

45:55.360 --> 45:55.860
Okay.

45:57.920 --> 45:59.360
I like efficiency and language.

45:59.360 --> 46:00.880
You can figure out what they mean from that.

46:00.880 --> 46:01.920
Just put torches.

46:01.920 --> 46:02.480
Put torches.

46:02.480 --> 46:03.760
Put torches around them.

46:03.760 --> 46:04.800
No spider.

46:04.800 --> 46:05.360
On them?

46:05.360 --> 46:05.860
Near them?

46:05.860 --> 46:11.940
Um, so I have a whole bunch of these little, uh, these little

46:11.940 --> 46:16.420
creepo, creepozoids in my house, and they want to catch me up

46:16.420 --> 46:19.540
in their net and suck me dry, so I do want to get rid of them

46:19.540 --> 46:21.780
like, but I do want to do it like Minecraft.

46:22.500 --> 46:24.820
I've been, I've been honing the...

46:24.820 --> 46:29.220
I, okay, I don't think that this person, just, I mean, it's

46:29.220 --> 46:30.980
all phrased very strangely.

46:30.980 --> 46:34.260
I don't think this person is necessarily saying, I want to

46:34.260 --> 46:37.700
get rid of spiders in my real home in the same fashion that

46:37.700 --> 46:40.900
I dispose of these little bastards in the game Minecraft.

46:40.900 --> 46:42.260
You don't think that's it, Justin?

46:42.260 --> 46:44.180
Because that's exactly how your boy took it.

46:44.180 --> 46:44.980
That's hit at me.

46:44.980 --> 46:45.860
That's how it hit me too.

46:45.860 --> 46:50.180
No, I think this person is saying, I think the like Minecraft

46:50.180 --> 46:53.780
here is meant to indicate, ah, I should have clarified when

46:53.780 --> 46:55.220
I began the question.

46:55.220 --> 46:58.020
This is written regards to the video game Minecraft.

46:58.820 --> 47:00.500
No, Justin, I'm sorry.

47:00.500 --> 47:02.340
I'm going to put my foot down here and say that they're

47:02.340 --> 47:05.220
saying, I would like to get rid of the spiders in my house

47:05.220 --> 47:07.060
like I do in Minecraft.

47:07.060 --> 47:07.380
Yeah.

47:07.380 --> 47:09.460
So if you don't have anything fucking helpful to say, go

47:09.460 --> 47:11.540
record a Sawbones or something, okay?

47:11.540 --> 47:13.300
Because Travis and I are dialed in here.

47:13.300 --> 47:15.700
You got two out of three brothers telling you that this

47:15.700 --> 47:18.500
person wants to Minecraft these spiders.

47:18.500 --> 47:21.860
And I'm here to tell you, you find out where the spiders are

47:21.860 --> 47:25.220
and then you go to where that is and you punch the fuck out of

47:25.220 --> 47:27.540
the cube that they live in until that part of your house

47:27.540 --> 47:28.420
explodes.

47:28.420 --> 47:28.740
Yes.

47:29.380 --> 47:29.860
That's it.

47:29.860 --> 47:33.140
But I mean, that's one of many ways to do it.

47:33.140 --> 47:34.660
What else are you going to do?

47:34.660 --> 47:37.540
I guess you could carry around, I don't know, like bricks or

47:37.540 --> 47:40.740
like cinder blocks or something and like stack them on top of

47:40.740 --> 47:41.300
the spider.

47:41.300 --> 47:43.060
Does that work in Minecraft?

47:43.060 --> 47:43.540
It does.

47:43.540 --> 47:45.060
Yeah, that'll goosh them up real good.

47:45.060 --> 47:47.540
And then you can take that and you can build a spider guts

47:47.540 --> 47:53.220
wall out of it for your, for a void house for a weirdo who

47:53.220 --> 47:55.860
wants to live in like an HR gig or sort of nightmare zone.

47:55.860 --> 47:58.980
Well, here's some things to keep in mind.

47:58.980 --> 48:02.500
Apparently the spider is a neutral mob.

48:03.060 --> 48:08.420
That means that it will only attack you during the day in

48:08.420 --> 48:12.820
survival mode if you attack it first, but it will always attack

48:12.820 --> 48:14.820
you at night in survival mode.

48:14.820 --> 48:15.780
They get moon horny.

48:16.340 --> 48:21.220
Is this an option to just avoid them during the day and just

48:21.220 --> 48:25.300
sort of like stay closed up in your spider free room through

48:25.300 --> 48:26.100
the evening?

48:26.100 --> 48:26.900
Is that possible?

48:26.900 --> 48:27.700
You don't even have to be.

48:27.700 --> 48:28.260
Yeah, you can.

48:28.260 --> 48:30.020
You don't even have to avoid them during the day.

48:30.020 --> 48:32.900
It sounds like like you guys can like chill in the house and

48:32.900 --> 48:36.340
like go out and talk and they can give you sex advice like

48:36.340 --> 48:37.540
Joe's apartment.

48:37.540 --> 48:43.460
And then after that, but then you're like, yeah, we are

48:43.460 --> 48:44.900
fucking crushing it.

48:44.900 --> 48:47.700
So the spiders are like, yeah, you got to hit it from the back.

48:48.500 --> 48:51.540
And then you're like, oh shit, guys, it's, it's six 42.

48:51.540 --> 48:53.060
I better go board myself up.

48:53.060 --> 48:54.580
And they're like, yeah, man, get to it.

48:54.580 --> 48:55.460
You know how we get.

48:59.620 --> 49:02.820
Boy, I wish I hadn't conjured the specter of Joe's apartment.

49:02.820 --> 49:04.820
It's just there, isn't it?

49:04.820 --> 49:05.540
It's just there.

49:05.540 --> 49:06.580
It's just there.

49:06.580 --> 49:07.700
It's in my mouth.

49:08.340 --> 49:13.220
Jerry O'Connell hovers above your computer now, hoping you'll

49:13.220 --> 49:16.260
reference him two more times and bring the remake to life.

49:18.180 --> 49:19.060
So that's one option.

49:20.420 --> 49:21.460
I hate my book club.

49:21.460 --> 49:25.060
Oh, I thought it'd be cool, but it sucks.

49:27.460 --> 49:30.580
I've been in it for six months, though, and it's a really small

49:30.580 --> 49:32.900
club, so I feel bad about bouncing, especially because

49:32.900 --> 49:35.220
they talked about how grateful they are that I've joined.

49:35.220 --> 49:37.780
Any advice on the best way to leave without looking like a

49:37.780 --> 49:38.420
dick?

49:38.420 --> 49:40.980
What excuse can I give other than I don't like your company

49:40.980 --> 49:41.940
or opinions.

49:41.940 --> 49:45.220
We only meet every six to eight weeks, so I'm really busy.

49:45.220 --> 49:46.180
Seems unbelievable.

49:46.820 --> 49:49.540
That's from looking to leave in LA.

49:49.540 --> 49:53.300
This book club must be the absolute pits.

49:53.300 --> 49:57.300
If in six months, that means you've met at most, what, like

49:57.860 --> 49:58.820
five times?

49:58.820 --> 50:00.020
Yeah, four and a half times.

50:00.020 --> 50:02.260
And you're like, I can't anymore.

50:02.260 --> 50:05.540
If I had an obligation that required me to only remember it

50:05.540 --> 50:08.900
every two months, that would be heaven.

50:08.900 --> 50:18.500
Can you start inviting a lot of dope ballers to your book club?

50:18.500 --> 50:24.260
And it's in, like, a lot of real hip cats, and you get them

50:24.260 --> 50:30.100
to come to the book club and just sort of dilute the shares

50:30.100 --> 50:33.060
of the terrible people until it's a cool book club.

50:33.060 --> 50:35.300
Is that a devoting out situation?

50:35.300 --> 50:35.700
I don't know.

50:35.700 --> 50:36.740
I've never been in a book club.

50:36.740 --> 50:37.540
I see.

50:37.540 --> 50:39.940
That's good.

50:40.820 --> 50:44.180
You could also just kind of dip, and that's my jam, is that

50:44.180 --> 50:47.620
if you are doing something you don't like doing, you dip on

50:47.620 --> 50:51.300
it because best case scenario, they don't actually care that

50:51.300 --> 50:52.820
much that you took off.

50:52.820 --> 50:57.060
And worst case scenario is not really a problem anymore

50:57.060 --> 50:58.420
because you dip, didn't you?

50:58.420 --> 51:00.580
You dip and you have more time to do cool stuff and hang out

51:00.580 --> 51:01.860
with people you enjoy.

51:01.860 --> 51:04.180
Oh, and when they call to check on you, you just say, like,

51:04.180 --> 51:05.460
I finished the book.

51:05.460 --> 51:06.420
I finished the book.

51:06.420 --> 51:09.700
So I thought we were all working together to try and get

51:09.700 --> 51:12.500
through War and Peace, and I beat it.

51:12.500 --> 51:13.300
I beat the boss.

51:13.300 --> 51:15.460
So I don't need your help anymore, guys.

51:15.460 --> 51:17.700
Yeah, we're done, right?

51:17.700 --> 51:20.100
And then act very confused.

51:21.140 --> 51:25.860
And then, I don't know, tell them another book club invited

51:25.860 --> 51:27.380
you over and you liked the book.

51:27.380 --> 51:28.500
They were reading better.

51:29.700 --> 51:30.660
Oh, that's good.

51:30.660 --> 51:31.700
It has nothing to do about them.

51:31.700 --> 51:34.020
You've just always wanted to read Animal Farm.

51:34.020 --> 51:36.820
And so you had to go.

51:36.820 --> 51:40.100
Yeah, I am distrustful of a person that can't come up with

51:40.100 --> 51:44.180
a great lie every six to eight weeks because I can crank out

51:44.180 --> 51:44.980
a bad boy.

51:44.980 --> 51:46.820
I mean, I'm doing this on the daily.

51:46.820 --> 51:48.820
Can't come up with the excuses to not do things.

51:49.700 --> 51:52.260
I think it is suspicious that you can't cook one up every

51:52.260 --> 51:54.820
six to eight weeks because I could definitely come up with

51:54.820 --> 51:57.940
shit I am doing if I was only called to do that every

51:57.940 --> 51:59.300
couple of months.

51:59.300 --> 52:04.580
You could also come dressed up with a sheet with eye holes

52:04.580 --> 52:06.980
cut out in it and you walk in and they're like, why are you

52:06.980 --> 52:07.540
dressed like that?

52:07.540 --> 52:09.060
You'd be like, it's time for me to be honest.

52:10.020 --> 52:13.060
The whole time I thought it was boo club and I came here the

52:13.060 --> 52:15.620
first time thinking it was boo club and I was too embarrassed

52:15.620 --> 52:16.980
to say anything about it.

52:16.980 --> 52:22.660
But I'm here now and I'm just a guy in a ghost costume standing

52:22.660 --> 52:26.180
before a group of people whose opinions I don't respect saying,

52:26.180 --> 52:28.500
do you want to transform this into a boo club?

52:28.500 --> 52:30.100
Because if not, I'm gonzo.

52:31.620 --> 52:34.740
Maybe you guys will have better opinions about ghosts and

52:34.740 --> 52:35.700
paranormal stuff.

52:37.220 --> 52:39.140
I love your company.

52:39.140 --> 52:42.740
I can't stand reading and I also love fighting.

52:42.740 --> 52:45.140
So I want to turn this into a fight club.

52:45.140 --> 52:47.540
And is that an option that's even on the table that we can

52:47.540 --> 52:48.020
talk about?

52:48.020 --> 52:48.980
Because I would love that.

52:49.940 --> 52:51.700
Who wants to destroy something beautiful with me?

52:51.700 --> 52:52.820
Come on, let's do it.

52:52.820 --> 52:54.020
Let's start with the book club.

52:54.020 --> 52:55.060
Not see any hands?

52:55.060 --> 52:56.020
Shoot.

52:56.020 --> 52:57.060
Shoot.

52:57.060 --> 52:58.900
Shoot, okay.

52:58.900 --> 53:01.940
I'm going to start a fight club outside.

53:01.940 --> 53:04.260
Anyone who wants to join me, I will be on the porch during

53:04.260 --> 53:05.460
your book club meetings.

53:07.860 --> 53:10.020
Who's still doing book clubs?

53:10.020 --> 53:13.540
Like who's still, if you really want to bounce some ideas off

53:13.540 --> 53:17.540
the meaning of this shit, like hack into some accelerated

53:17.540 --> 53:20.740
reader tests and take those online and then get good points

53:20.740 --> 53:22.420
that you can spend at Pizza Hut or whatever.

53:22.980 --> 53:23.620
Something.

53:23.620 --> 53:24.020
Something.

53:24.580 --> 53:25.140
Something.

53:25.140 --> 53:26.020
Just call the author.

53:26.020 --> 53:27.060
Did I get it right?

53:27.060 --> 53:28.100
You got it right.

53:28.100 --> 53:28.500
Awesome.

53:29.460 --> 53:30.180
Thank you.

53:30.180 --> 53:31.300
Thank you, Mr. Salinger.

53:31.300 --> 53:32.100
Sorry to bother you.

53:32.100 --> 53:32.900
Sorry to bother you.

53:32.900 --> 53:33.540
That's okay.

53:33.540 --> 53:34.580
No one ever talks to me.

53:34.580 --> 53:35.540
I'm so lonely.

53:36.180 --> 53:38.020
Why doesn't anyone ever want to talk to me?

53:38.020 --> 53:42.340
What's the catcher about difficulties of childhood youth?

53:42.900 --> 53:44.180
I was drunk when I wrote it.

53:44.740 --> 53:45.780
Yes, I think so.

53:45.780 --> 53:47.140
Yes, you got it right.

53:47.860 --> 53:48.900
Hey, do you want to hear?

53:48.900 --> 53:51.540
I've got the first few chapters of Catcher 2 done.

53:51.540 --> 53:53.940
Do you want to hear the picture in their eye?

53:53.940 --> 53:56.100
Hi, you actually got it better than me.

53:56.100 --> 53:57.860
You knew better than what I thought.

53:57.860 --> 53:58.420
You've got it.

53:58.420 --> 53:59.780
I'm passing it down to you now.

53:59.780 --> 54:01.220
Now you're the Salinger.

54:01.220 --> 54:03.380
And he takes off his ring and he turns into bones.

54:06.100 --> 54:08.100
What's really sad is I know you're not a skeleton,

54:08.100 --> 54:10.900
but the first thing I thought is like Emily Deschanel from Bones.

54:11.460 --> 54:12.580
Ah, Trav.

54:12.580 --> 54:13.700
That doesn't make any sense.

54:13.700 --> 54:15.540
I know, but I'm a real character.

54:15.540 --> 54:15.780
Yeah.

54:16.580 --> 54:18.740
Thank you so much for listening to our podcast.

54:19.460 --> 54:21.940
My brother, my brother, main advice show for the modern era.

54:21.940 --> 54:24.820
Yeah, we hope you've enjoyed yourself.

54:24.820 --> 54:27.780
Sorry about all the very obscure references this time.

54:27.780 --> 54:30.340
And a lot of placenta talk there for a while.

54:30.340 --> 54:31.460
A lot of placenta talk.

54:32.020 --> 54:34.740
Just some recommended reading for this week's episode.

54:35.300 --> 54:38.580
You can Google Billy Joel and Google...

54:40.180 --> 54:42.820
Cager, the Washington General's monster.

54:43.460 --> 54:45.220
Joe's Apartment, which was a...

54:45.220 --> 54:48.820
Mental Floss article about that Punky Brewster episode.

54:48.820 --> 54:52.980
Joe's Apartment was a movie based on...

54:54.260 --> 54:54.740
What was it?

54:54.740 --> 54:55.540
Like a...

54:55.540 --> 54:56.980
Like sketches, sketches.

54:56.980 --> 54:58.020
Like a skit.

54:59.780 --> 55:00.580
It's a short...

55:00.580 --> 55:06.660
It's like between show, like commercial basically on MTV.

55:06.660 --> 55:07.380
It's wild.

55:07.380 --> 55:07.620
Okay.

55:07.620 --> 55:08.500
But it is a movie.

55:08.500 --> 55:09.380
They also did.

55:10.020 --> 55:11.380
Roger Ebert wrote at the time,

55:11.380 --> 55:13.220
Joe's Apartment would be a very bad comedy

55:13.220 --> 55:14.340
even without the roaches.

55:14.900 --> 55:15.300
Wow.

55:15.300 --> 55:15.940
Okay.

55:15.940 --> 55:17.060
That's wild.

55:17.060 --> 55:19.540
Really tying their arms behind him there.

55:20.820 --> 55:21.380
Right.

55:21.380 --> 55:24.020
It wouldn't make much sense, I would guess.

55:24.020 --> 55:27.220
It would leave more room for O'Connell to stretch his wings.

55:27.220 --> 55:28.980
To really get out there and strut his stuff.

55:30.020 --> 55:31.060
His acting wings.

55:32.980 --> 55:34.420
We have new...

55:34.420 --> 55:36.500
I don't know if we talked about it, but we have...

55:36.500 --> 55:38.660

It's not preferable.

57:26.180 --> 57:27.940
Do you all want the final Yahoo?

57:27.940 --> 57:28.340
Of course.

Thank you, Mike.

57:32.100 --> 57:39.060
It's from Yahoo Answers user, Eva, who does ask, how do people in pie factories

57:39.060 --> 57:44.340
know which box or wrapper to put on a pie if they can't see what's inside of it?

57:44.340 --> 57:44.820
Yes.

Damn, that's good.

Hello, this is Amy Mann and I'm Ted Leo.

58:21.540 --> 58:24.340
And we have a podcast called The Art of Process.

58:24.340 --> 58:27.860
We've been lucky enough over the past year to talk to some of our friends and acquaintances

58:27.860 --> 58:31.220
from across the creative spectrum to find out how they actually work.

58:31.220 --> 58:34.500
So I have to write material that makes sense and makes people laugh.

58:34.500 --> 58:37.860
I also have to think about what I'm saying to people.

58:37.860 --> 58:40.260
If I kick your ass, I'll make you famous.

58:40.260 --> 58:43.700
The fight to get LGBTQ representation in the show.

58:44.260 --> 58:47.140
We weirdly don't know as many musicians as you would expect.

58:47.140 --> 58:49.780
I really just became a political speechwriter by accident.

58:49.780 --> 58:53.140
Realizing that I have accidentally pulled my pants down.

58:53.140 --> 58:58.260
