00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:48.880
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me, an advice show for the modern

00:48.880 --> 00:54.320
era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

00:54.320 --> 00:57.200
I'm your baby, Griffin McElroy. Candle nights, 20 Flirt.

00:57.200 --> 01:01.920
And I'm Charlie Dickens, aren't I? Now listen, why would you think Charles

01:01.920 --> 01:04.800
Dickens would be a child? Charles Dickens is like a grown-ass man.

01:04.800 --> 01:09.200
I'm Charlie Dickens. I have yet to write any of the books you might recognize.

01:09.200 --> 01:12.720
No, right now I mostly just look at girls and get boners.

01:12.720 --> 01:18.240
I'm an established author, loved her on the Christmas time holiday, don't I?

01:18.240 --> 01:22.640
I am tremendously sorry that we started out the episode with Travis saying the word boners. Like,

01:22.640 --> 01:26.160
we warned you there's not going to be any curse words, just challenging ideas,

01:26.160 --> 01:29.680
challenging material. Sort of like an Oliver Twist when you have

01:29.680 --> 01:34.160
to learn about orphans, don't you? The challenging topic of orphans.

01:34.160 --> 01:36.640
It is challenging. Deal with it.

01:36.640 --> 01:42.720
Fagin's sort of vaguely anti-Semitic, isn't he? I'm so sorry about that, Fagin.

01:42.720 --> 01:45.200
It was a different time. And none of that has anything to do with

01:45.200 --> 01:48.240
Christmas. Like, he wrote a book about Christmas.

01:48.240 --> 01:52.320
I wrote Christmas Songs, the book. It's about Freakos, isn't it?

01:52.320 --> 01:56.000
Should we paint the picture of what we're doing? Because I'm looking at the levels.

01:56.000 --> 02:01.600
I'm four feet tall and I've got a tear-stove pipette and I'm on Justin's lap.

02:01.600 --> 02:03.840
I wasn't looking for, like, an ASL situation.

02:03.840 --> 02:06.960
This is what Charlie did. I want you to do the vision.

02:06.960 --> 02:09.440
There's three of us jammed around the same microphone.

02:09.440 --> 02:10.720
Three of us? So did Justin leave?

02:12.320 --> 02:16.240
Justin became embarrassed. He stepped out to give me my paraffin wax

02:16.240 --> 02:19.040
so I could roll my cigarettes. Oh, God bless.

02:19.040 --> 02:22.160
You are way too young to be getting into it. Because, like, cigarettes back in the day were,

02:22.160 --> 02:28.240
like, heavy doge. Well, everybody died sooner, didn't they? So we started smoking at 7 or 8.

02:28.240 --> 02:31.840
We're in the meat space together. The physical presence of each other.

02:31.840 --> 02:34.880
I don't think we've done this since God's spaghettageddon, and that was a...

02:34.880 --> 02:38.000
In my defense, I'm a ghost. That was a disaster.

02:38.000 --> 02:42.320
You are not taking up much corporeal space. I'm very tiny, except for my hat.

02:43.600 --> 02:47.120
The hat is real. The body is not. It's like AI, but weirder.

02:47.120 --> 02:51.600
You're listening to 20 Flirt Christmas. I don't even know what that word was.

02:51.600 --> 02:55.600
It just left my lips. Candle Nights is the episode you're looking for.

02:55.600 --> 02:59.360
Share it with friends. Share it with family. No swears. No curses. No fouls.

02:59.360 --> 03:01.120
No wordy-derds. No cussing.

03:01.120 --> 03:02.960
I mean, there will be, and we will try to edit them.

03:02.960 --> 03:04.880
It's going to be hard because we're all on the same mix,

03:04.880 --> 03:08.480
and that is, as you editors out there know, kind of a tough pie.

03:08.480 --> 03:16.640
Yeah, but we will do our very best. We've got a lot of holiday-themed fun questions for you.

03:16.640 --> 03:21.120
You know what's so strange is we are actual brothers. A lot of people ask us that.

03:21.120 --> 03:25.520
We are actually brothers, but I find, when making this show,

03:25.520 --> 03:30.000
I find your guys' physical presence here highly distracting.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.480
Yeah, it's weird because now you guys are going to know how little

03:32.480 --> 03:34.880
I actually pay attention when I'm not speaking.

03:34.880 --> 03:39.920
Uh, that's not, no, I think we're pretty plugged in on that.

03:40.720 --> 03:41.520
Yeah, on that end.

03:42.880 --> 03:47.600
I watched, very recently, the Pee Wee's Playhouse Christmas special,

03:47.600 --> 03:51.760
and I was wondering if it would be possible for us to match it

03:51.760 --> 03:55.120
for, like, having the weirdest guest stars on this.

03:55.120 --> 04:00.480
I watched that last year for the first time in forever, and it is weird. It's got, who all?

04:00.480 --> 04:05.920
Grace Jones shows up, does what she does, which is to say, creeps me out to the extreme.

04:05.920 --> 04:10.080
The Andrew Sisters are on it, or some sort of set of triplets, some triplet set.

04:10.080 --> 04:13.600
Not the Andrew Sisters, they'd be long dead. Some sort of set of triplets is there.

04:14.720 --> 04:16.240
Little Richard shows up, if we recall.

04:16.240 --> 04:19.040
Little Richard is definitely in the mix. There's a chair that talks!

04:19.040 --> 04:21.840
Well, I mean, Cherry's a permanent fixture there.

04:21.840 --> 04:23.520
Cherry shows up, surprise!

04:23.520 --> 04:28.000
How hard would it be for us to get Grace Jones just, like, on the set?

04:28.640 --> 04:29.680
Who is Grace Jones?

04:29.680 --> 04:34.400
Grace Jones was in, well, she was in Mad Max, and I think a James Bond movie.

04:34.400 --> 04:35.280
Oh, gotcha.

04:35.280 --> 04:35.760
Yeah, you know?

04:35.760 --> 04:36.160
Gotcha.

04:36.160 --> 04:39.520
Um, so, uh, let's actually get into some questions so we can help.

04:39.520 --> 04:42.320
Now, I do want to apologize in advance. Again, just want to repeat,

04:42.320 --> 04:44.320
Travis and I are sharing a microphone.

04:44.320 --> 04:46.800
Uh, kissing, kissing between every sentence.

04:46.800 --> 04:48.320
Yeah, uh, don't say that.

04:48.320 --> 04:49.120
Kissing, brothers.

04:49.120 --> 04:52.080
Just real quick, I need you two to look at this picture Grace Jones just found.

04:53.840 --> 04:54.320
Sweet, perfect.

04:54.320 --> 04:55.280
And we can move on.

04:55.280 --> 04:55.600
Moving on.

04:55.600 --> 04:56.640
We're all in a good headspace.

04:56.640 --> 04:58.560
Alright, uh, here's a question.

04:58.560 --> 05:03.520
Hey, brothers, my boyfriend comes from a country where Christmas isn't really celebrated,

05:03.520 --> 05:06.400
and we're spending our first holiday together outside of America.

05:06.400 --> 05:10.880
How can I help him understand all the magical feelings surrounding the holidays?

05:10.880 --> 05:15.040
Should I plan some activities or just have him binge watch Christmas movies?

05:15.040 --> 05:15.840
Please help.

05:16.400 --> 05:19.120
That's from Santa in South Korea.

05:19.120 --> 05:21.840
The binge watching only works if you put him in a chair that has, like,

05:21.840 --> 05:23.680
metal clamps that hold his eyes open.

05:24.240 --> 05:26.480
And you're just screaming, like, jingle, jingle!

05:26.480 --> 05:29.760
Now, when they say that Christmas isn't really celebrated in South Korea,

05:29.760 --> 05:33.040
do they actually mean that it is celebrated but for, like,

05:33.040 --> 05:36.000
only the last two weeks of December and not for three and a half months?

05:36.000 --> 05:36.800
Like, it isn't the same?

05:36.800 --> 05:38.960
No, everyone just does it very lackadaisically.

05:38.960 --> 05:41.600
They're just like, oh, merry Christmas, I guess.

05:41.600 --> 05:42.480
I guess, whatever.

05:42.480 --> 05:44.320
Oh, eggnog.

05:44.320 --> 05:48.720
The obvious answer is to just jump that gap, the Christmas gap.

05:48.720 --> 05:50.720
Jump right over that land, right in Candle Nights.

05:50.720 --> 05:52.480
Obviously, the superior territory to be.

05:54.240 --> 06:00.000
But if you're committed to the Christian version of Candle Nights,

06:01.040 --> 06:07.360
I think you could get somewhere by showing him some holiday films that are more sort of

06:07.360 --> 06:15.680
humanist rather than they are, like, the magic of Santa showing up at the last minute,

06:15.680 --> 06:17.120
like he always does in sitcoms.

06:17.120 --> 06:18.480
Like, if you were to show him...

06:18.480 --> 06:22.000
I mean, I don't think there's a human being alive who could not be touched by,

06:22.000 --> 06:23.840
for instance, It's a Wonderful Life.

06:23.840 --> 06:28.560
You watch that, and I think the magic of the holiday season, what everybody's on about,

06:28.560 --> 06:33.920
you know, which is really, at its core, about generosity and kindness and human warmth.

06:33.920 --> 06:36.000
I think something like that could help.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.560
Or what you could do was lie to him.

06:38.560 --> 06:42.560
Because this is your opportunity to create a bunch of Christmas traditions that do not

06:42.560 --> 06:43.520
really exist.

06:44.080 --> 06:47.920
Or just make it an extremely Krampus-oriented affair.

06:47.920 --> 06:48.560
Well, that's the thing.

06:48.560 --> 06:51.840
It's just occurred to me that what you can do is pick and choose.

06:51.840 --> 06:56.400
Because throughout the world, every different country and society has different, like,

06:56.400 --> 06:57.840
Christmas traditions.

06:57.840 --> 07:02.000
December 23rd, you have to give your girlfriend foot rubs.

07:02.000 --> 07:05.680
That's an old, or Santa will come down and eat your back.

07:05.680 --> 07:06.320
And there's stuff like...

07:08.000 --> 07:12.880
Well, I heard a tale that every Christmas, whoever hasn't taken out the garbage every

07:12.880 --> 07:16.240
week for the history of time will have his balls cut off.

07:16.240 --> 07:17.120
Well, that's not accurate.

07:17.120 --> 07:18.000
That's not true at all.

07:18.720 --> 07:20.800
The back-eating thing, that's lore.

07:20.800 --> 07:23.840
That's Welsh, I believe, in origin.

07:23.840 --> 07:26.640
What's the one where you have to put eggs in your shoes and stomp on them?

07:26.640 --> 07:31.680
Have you noticed how Welsh holidays almost always involve the figure for that holiday

07:31.680 --> 07:35.680
coming down to consume some non-vital part of your body for strength?

07:36.400 --> 07:37.200
You gotta keep it...

07:37.200 --> 07:38.000
There you go.

07:38.000 --> 07:38.320
All right.

07:39.440 --> 07:40.560
Well, Travis lowered my chair.

07:41.520 --> 07:43.600
And now it's broken, which is great.

07:43.600 --> 07:44.720
You broke my chair!

07:45.600 --> 07:46.800
This is a pretty good scene.

07:47.360 --> 07:48.320
The chair is broken.

07:49.600 --> 07:51.680
It's not a setting.

07:51.680 --> 07:53.120
It's just broken.

07:53.120 --> 07:54.720
It was actually a setting.

07:54.720 --> 07:55.520
I faked it.

07:57.120 --> 07:57.680
Okay, so...

07:57.680 --> 08:03.600
So, I mean, the other thing is, I don't know if his tastes are acclimated.

08:03.600 --> 08:06.880
If he comes from another country, I'm not sure if he's gonna be ready for the amount

08:06.880 --> 08:10.400
of sugar and butter we're about to jam down his gullet.

08:10.400 --> 08:14.560
You may wanna start with something a little more savory, maybe a mincemeat pie or something

08:14.560 --> 08:15.280
like that.

08:15.280 --> 08:17.120
Can you make a Christmas kimchi?

08:17.120 --> 08:18.080
Is that possible?

08:18.080 --> 08:18.960
That would be nice.

08:18.960 --> 08:19.360
You know what?

08:19.360 --> 08:26.000
What about a blending of you replace imagery from the holidays with...

08:26.000 --> 08:29.920
And, like, basically Photoshop in, but really, not fake.

08:29.920 --> 08:34.080
Like, actually insert some South Korean imagery.

08:34.080 --> 08:39.680
Like, you have a picture of Santa, but behind him, there's a dead girl crawling on the ceiling.

08:39.680 --> 08:41.200
I am not very inundated in that culture.

08:41.200 --> 08:43.040
Yeah, dog, that's not great.

08:43.040 --> 08:44.160
That's not ideal.

08:44.160 --> 08:44.800
That was bad.

08:44.800 --> 08:45.280
Can you see?

08:45.280 --> 08:46.480
You know, that kind of idea.

08:46.480 --> 08:48.480
We're talking about an entire country.

08:48.480 --> 08:50.160
You can't think of a thing?

08:51.120 --> 08:52.480
They're not the bad one.

08:52.480 --> 08:53.040
I know that.

08:53.040 --> 08:53.360
Yeah.

08:53.360 --> 08:54.160
Oh, jeez.

08:54.720 --> 08:55.440
You know what, though?

08:55.440 --> 08:57.440
I could probably come up with more North Korean imagery.

08:58.080 --> 09:00.000
Well, let's just assume that, then.

09:00.000 --> 09:00.960
Okay, well...

09:00.960 --> 09:06.480
It's really a shame that the Northern Korea gets all the credit for being the bad girl.

09:06.480 --> 09:07.120
You know what I mean?

09:07.120 --> 09:12.240
It's like the girl in The Bachelorette that he keeps around for ratings, and he doesn't

09:12.240 --> 09:14.000
realize that the right answer is right in front of him.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.520
Ben, what are you doing?

09:15.520 --> 09:18.080
You made the worst call of your entire life.

09:18.080 --> 09:18.580
Yeah.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.160
Griffin, how about a Yahoo?

09:22.160 --> 09:22.640
How's that sound?

09:22.640 --> 09:23.200
Sure.

09:23.200 --> 09:26.000
A Christmas-y, sort of holiday, caramelized Yahoo.

09:26.000 --> 09:29.920
Let me close all these naked pictures of Grace Jones that popped up on my Google.

09:30.720 --> 09:32.640
Don't show me naked pictures of Grace Jones.

09:32.640 --> 09:33.440
I didn't want to.

09:33.440 --> 09:34.400
It's just what came up.

09:34.400 --> 09:35.280
You're really upsetting.

09:35.280 --> 09:36.320
I'm a married man.

09:38.160 --> 09:38.960
How about this?

09:38.960 --> 09:40.960
This one was sent in by Drew Davenport.

09:40.960 --> 09:42.400
Thanks, Drew Davenport.

09:42.400 --> 09:47.600
It's by Yahoo Answers user thistumblr0 who asks,

09:47.600 --> 09:52.800
Thanks, I always have a hard time falling asleep on Christmas Eve because I'm excited.

09:53.360 --> 09:57.200
Any tips on how I can fall asleep faster or relax or something?

09:58.560 --> 09:59.060
Okay.

09:59.600 --> 10:01.680
I had this problem a lot growing up.

10:01.680 --> 10:08.800
I can think of one where I thought that I didn't fall asleep at all.

10:08.800 --> 10:11.280
I think I had one Christmas Eve where I feel like I didn't sleep.

10:11.280 --> 10:14.080
You just rocked the mic from dusk till dawn.

10:14.080 --> 10:14.580
Yeah.

10:14.960 --> 10:16.000
No sleep till Santa.

10:16.000 --> 10:20.720
If there was one year I remember Griffin and I had bunk beds, it was last year.

10:21.840 --> 10:24.880
Griffin and I had bunk beds and I was laying in the bottom bunk thinking,

10:25.440 --> 10:29.600
if I raised up fast enough, I bet I could bash my head on the top bunk hard enough to

10:29.600 --> 10:32.400
knock myself unconscious till Christmas morning.

10:32.400 --> 10:38.000
What is good is to think about all the children in developing nations that aren't going to have

10:38.000 --> 10:41.360
a Christmas this year because that really helps to counterbalance.

10:41.360 --> 10:43.520
You know the song, Do They Know It's Christmas Time At All?

10:43.520 --> 10:45.760
If you meditate on that song.

10:45.760 --> 10:50.400
I think it'll counterbalance your excitement to get you to an even keel.

10:50.400 --> 10:53.440
Or maybe just pop a couple zannies and have a nice big glass of scotch.

10:53.440 --> 10:56.000
Yeah, maybe just crunch down some zanny bars.

10:56.000 --> 10:59.280
Maybe leave a couple for ho-ho and have a couple for yourself.

10:59.280 --> 11:02.320
You know, just because it's Christmas Eve doesn't mean you can't party like it's Christmas.

11:02.320 --> 11:02.960
You know what I mean?

11:03.680 --> 11:05.040
Nice ambient trip.

11:05.040 --> 11:06.320
You want to see Santa?

11:06.320 --> 11:07.120
You can see Santa.

11:07.120 --> 11:07.680
You can see Santa.

11:07.680 --> 11:09.120
You'll see some sugar plums.

11:09.120 --> 11:10.000
And you can see Santa.

11:10.000 --> 11:10.480
And what's that?

11:10.480 --> 11:12.000
Oh no, he's turning into a lizard.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.200
Oh, and he's angry.

11:13.200 --> 11:13.680
Run away.

11:13.680 --> 11:14.480
Come here, Jim Jim.

11:14.480 --> 11:16.080
I made you these edibles.

11:16.080 --> 11:17.120
Come here, Jim.

11:17.120 --> 11:18.080
It's Christmas Eve.

11:18.080 --> 11:19.120
You got sugar plums on your head.

11:19.120 --> 11:19.680
You can't sleep.

11:20.640 --> 11:22.400
Eat these brownies daddy made.

11:23.920 --> 11:29.760
I actually had one year where I had to deliver newspapers.

11:29.760 --> 11:34.080
So I had to stay up till the middle of the night because they put them out earlier for the paper

11:34.080 --> 11:36.800
boys who would be asleep for some part of Santa's visit.

11:37.680 --> 11:42.160
And I remember watching Beavis and Butthead in my room waiting for the papers to arrive.

11:42.160 --> 11:43.200
There's not a joke here.

11:43.200 --> 11:46.800
It's just a sad, treasured holiday memory that I remember.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.360
You guys ever had to work on Christmas?

11:50.000 --> 11:51.840
Sometimes you have to work on Christmas sometimes.

11:53.040 --> 11:56.320
I worked at Blockbuster.

11:56.320 --> 11:57.840
Oh my god, why would they?

11:57.840 --> 11:58.320
Who would?

11:58.880 --> 11:59.360
Everyone.

11:59.360 --> 12:00.560
The answer is everyone.

12:00.560 --> 12:03.040
The question that you're asking is who?

12:03.040 --> 12:06.320
And the answer, as it turns out, is everyone.

12:06.320 --> 12:07.040
Everyone.

12:07.040 --> 12:08.240
It's the second busiest day.

12:09.440 --> 12:10.480
You are kidding me.

12:10.480 --> 12:11.920
No, because this is my theory.

12:11.920 --> 12:13.200
Let me paint a picture.

12:13.200 --> 12:17.920
You wake up, all the presents are open, and it's like 12-30 in the afternoon, and you

12:17.920 --> 12:22.080
realize, oh no, now I just have to deal with these people for the rest of the day.

12:22.080 --> 12:22.880
That's exactly it.

12:22.880 --> 12:24.960
I gotta go get a Spongebob movie or something.

12:24.960 --> 12:26.320
Do you know what the busiest day of the year is?

12:26.320 --> 12:27.440
And this was shocking.

12:27.440 --> 12:28.640
Is it gonna bum me out too?

12:28.640 --> 12:29.680
No, it's...

12:29.680 --> 12:30.320
My birthday?

12:30.320 --> 12:31.200
My birthday.

12:31.200 --> 12:35.280
No, New Year's Eve was the busiest video rental day.

12:35.280 --> 12:38.240
Well, because you gotta get videos for the kids to watch while the parents party downstairs.

12:38.240 --> 12:39.440
I think that's exactly it.

12:39.440 --> 12:41.840
Third is Thanksgiving.

12:41.840 --> 12:42.880
Thanksgiving's huge too.

12:43.680 --> 12:47.120
One time on New Year's Eve, we were open till midnight.

12:48.320 --> 12:51.520
So wait, you closed right as you counted?

12:51.520 --> 12:55.120
They couldn't let you go five minutes early, so maybe you could hop on the bike and scoot

12:55.120 --> 12:55.280
home?

12:55.280 --> 12:56.640
No dice there.

12:56.640 --> 13:04.800
Did watch on a little TV with rabbit ears with my co-workers Carl and Jimmy, who farted

13:04.800 --> 13:05.360
on me once.

13:05.360 --> 13:08.320
Oh, was that his full name?

13:09.360 --> 13:10.640
Jimmy, uh...

13:10.640 --> 13:10.960
Was he...

13:10.960 --> 13:12.400
Wait, was he Native American?

13:13.040 --> 13:13.540
Jimmy...

13:15.920 --> 13:17.120
Jimmy walks and toots.

13:17.120 --> 13:21.840
No, Jimmy would drop things behind him and ask me to pick them up.

13:21.840 --> 13:24.320
And then when I would bend over to pick them up, he would fart on my head.

13:24.320 --> 13:25.040
Like on your...

13:25.040 --> 13:27.120
Like on your head?

13:27.120 --> 13:28.480
Yeah, he would fart on my head.

13:28.480 --> 13:30.720
And Jimmy got fired because he...

13:31.680 --> 13:32.720
Not for head farting?

13:32.720 --> 13:34.480
There was a second thing he did?

13:34.480 --> 13:36.480
He also embezzled.

13:36.480 --> 13:37.600
No, he embezzled.

13:37.600 --> 13:40.000
HR started riding his jock for all the toots.

13:40.000 --> 13:40.800
And they caught...

13:40.800 --> 13:41.840
There was some other...

13:41.840 --> 13:44.400
There was some other stuff in that lint trap.

13:44.400 --> 13:49.680
What actually happened is he inhaled half of a helium tank from the back room and knocked

13:49.680 --> 13:50.240
himself out.

13:53.040 --> 13:55.280
His farts were so high pitched the next day.

13:55.920 --> 13:56.720
We actually...

13:56.720 --> 14:01.040
No, when I closed New Year's Eve that one night, we were there till midnight ringing

14:01.040 --> 14:03.040
in the New Year with my other employees.

14:03.040 --> 14:09.680
And yes, don't worry, there was one sad woman browsing romantic comedies at the stroke of

14:09.680 --> 14:13.280
midnight was just ringing in the New Year.

14:13.280 --> 14:14.560
What did she rent?

14:14.560 --> 14:15.440
With Dylan McDermott.

14:15.440 --> 14:18.160
Was there a moment where she looked down at her watch and was just like, oh.

14:19.760 --> 14:22.400
Well, my New Year's resolution, more of the same.

14:24.560 --> 14:29.440
I think she ended up bringing my best friend's wedding, which is ironic because both the ideas

14:29.440 --> 14:33.440
expressed in that title would be completely foreign to her.

14:33.440 --> 14:34.240
How about another question?

14:35.200 --> 14:35.760
Candle Nights.

14:35.760 --> 14:37.120
Do we curse in there?

14:37.120 --> 14:37.680
I don't know.

14:37.680 --> 14:38.800
I don't know either.

14:38.800 --> 14:39.680
I don't think so.

14:39.680 --> 14:40.800
Candle Nights question.

14:40.800 --> 14:45.200
For the past two years, I have worked in a small business with my boss and his wife.

14:45.200 --> 14:46.880
We're all fairly close and I've always exchanged...

14:46.880 --> 14:50.560
Can you drop the radio emcee like...

14:50.560 --> 14:51.120
Because it's like...

14:51.120 --> 14:52.880
Hello, welcome to Christmas Radio.

14:52.880 --> 14:53.600
Right, that's what I'm saying.

14:53.600 --> 14:53.920
This is like...

14:53.920 --> 14:57.200
It's something about the leaning over to get to the microphone.

14:57.200 --> 15:00.080
Right, but it's the three of us and we're brothers and we're like all together.

15:01.280 --> 15:02.960
People like these apps because it's like we're...

15:02.960 --> 15:03.760
Stop kissing me.

15:03.760 --> 15:04.720
Brother kisses.

15:04.720 --> 15:05.360
Kiss each other.

15:05.360 --> 15:06.560
Let's do one cheek at the same time.

15:06.560 --> 15:06.960
Okay, you're right.

15:06.960 --> 15:07.760
Come in here.

15:07.760 --> 15:08.800
I don't like it.

15:08.800 --> 15:10.560
I don't like it, daddy.

15:10.560 --> 15:14.240
For the past two years, I've worked in a small business with my boss and his wife.

15:14.240 --> 15:15.440
We're all fairly close.

15:15.440 --> 15:17.280
I've always exchanged Candle Nights gifts.

15:17.840 --> 15:19.040
Always is kind of...

15:19.040 --> 15:21.040
First of all, this is a relatively new event.

15:21.040 --> 15:25.600
We are not going to say that people were celebrating this stuff in 300 AD.

15:25.600 --> 15:27.840
This is a modern, this is a fresh holiday.

15:27.840 --> 15:29.680
So you didn't always exchange it.

15:29.680 --> 15:30.960
And it's copywritten, so...

15:32.560 --> 15:34.720
Ten months ago, we hired someone new.

15:34.720 --> 15:37.040
And I'm worried there's going to be some awkwardness.

15:37.040 --> 15:41.120
Should I explain him that we always exchange gifts so he doesn't feel left out?

15:41.120 --> 15:46.400
If so, what can I get my employers that is nice while also not trumping his present?

15:46.400 --> 15:47.920
And that says Happy.

15:47.920 --> 15:50.080
Candle Nights from Stumped in Sydney.

15:50.640 --> 15:54.240
Well, I mean, the real answer is you've got to do a gift exchange.

15:54.240 --> 15:57.680
And it sounds like there's four people here and everybody gets a present for somebody else.

15:57.680 --> 16:00.480
And that way everybody gets a present and no one's competing with anyone else.

16:00.480 --> 16:03.760
But the real answer is you're competing with his new employee.

16:03.760 --> 16:06.880
And you've got to trump him because the alternative is he trumps you.

16:08.000 --> 16:11.360
Listen, in this economy, one of you is going to get fired in 2014.

16:11.360 --> 16:12.720
And you want it to be 10 month Johnny.

16:12.720 --> 16:14.480
We've been pretty bullish on 2013.

16:14.480 --> 16:16.480
But let's not like, let's not kid ourselves.

16:16.480 --> 16:20.080
2014 is going to be like, we're going to get through this one by a thread.

16:21.120 --> 16:22.080
We're all going to be hanging.

16:22.080 --> 16:24.640
You guys might end up having to eat 10 months, Johnny.

16:24.640 --> 16:28.160
And you want to make sure maybe get him some some foods going to fatten him up.

16:28.160 --> 16:29.120
Maybe some muscle milk.

16:29.120 --> 16:31.840
Yeah, blow it out, blow out his lats.

16:31.840 --> 16:35.760
Can we come up with the Candle Nights stipulation in the bylaws?

16:36.800 --> 16:44.960
Stating that every present exchange that happens under the Candle Nights umbrella must be somehow

16:46.400 --> 16:51.280
contractually agreed upon by all parties involved in the exchange.

16:51.280 --> 16:56.640
Vis-a-vis price points, maybe supplied receipts.

16:56.640 --> 16:59.360
Yeah, we want it to be as clinical as possible.

16:59.360 --> 17:06.320
It has to be because nothing is worse than like, me and our, I feel like all of us and our

17:07.360 --> 17:12.480
step siblings have this issue of getting each other presents on every other year.

17:12.480 --> 17:16.160
And with this odd tango where we will get them stuff and then they'll get,

17:16.160 --> 17:17.360
they won't get us something.

17:17.360 --> 17:19.840
Which is like, cool, which is like, not making a big deal out of it.

17:19.840 --> 17:22.000
I honestly don't care about getting stuff anymore.

17:22.000 --> 17:22.720
It's the dance.

17:22.720 --> 17:25.440
It's the dance of like, well, you didn't get me stuff last year.

17:25.440 --> 17:27.760
And they're thinking like, well, they did get us stuff last year.

17:27.760 --> 17:30.000
Switchy swap, quantum leap into each other's bodies.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.680
Like, we got you this nice bottle of wine.

17:31.680 --> 17:33.760
Like, I should have left, damn it.

17:33.760 --> 17:37.760
If you had signed something, if you had signed something, we could have gotten this together.

17:37.760 --> 17:40.400
Everybody gets an empty box with another box inside of it.

17:40.400 --> 17:43.680
And then the next year you give that box back to somebody else and that's Candle Nights.

17:43.680 --> 17:47.040
I will be pro bono, au gratis.

17:47.040 --> 17:51.360
I will be the third party arbitrator for all of these contracts if that's what you want.

17:51.360 --> 17:54.640
Because like, I am really good at making sure that people don't like,

17:54.640 --> 17:57.520
I got you this scarf I knit, cool.

17:57.520 --> 17:59.200
Here's a new iPad retina mini.

17:59.200 --> 18:01.360
Booyah, like that sucks.

18:01.360 --> 18:04.080
We do a gift exchange at CSC every year.

18:04.080 --> 18:06.000
And like, it wasn't, it wasn't bad this year.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.280
In fact, it was pretty great this year.

18:07.280 --> 18:11.360
But in the past, what's always happened is there's always one new person that no one's

18:11.360 --> 18:14.320
gotten to know very well and they get their name and it's like,

18:14.320 --> 18:16.800
I got you some Cincinnati Shakespeare t-shirts.

18:16.800 --> 18:17.920
It's like, oh, thanks.

18:17.920 --> 18:18.560
I work here.

18:18.560 --> 18:19.920
I just saw them and thought of you.

18:19.920 --> 18:21.280
Here's three t-shirts from the place you work at.

18:21.280 --> 18:23.280
Well, if you get upset about that, then you're a child.

18:23.280 --> 18:23.680
Is there?

18:23.680 --> 18:24.480
I was not upset.

18:24.480 --> 18:26.080
But it's just like, it's a great upon everybody.

18:26.080 --> 18:27.360
You gotta talk into the mic.

18:27.360 --> 18:29.600
Everybody gets a gift card to Fandango.

18:29.600 --> 18:33.120
Is there, is there a market for an app that you put,

18:33.120 --> 18:36.080
maybe it connects to Facebook and it says, I'm buying gifts for these people.

18:36.080 --> 18:36.880
Public Santa.

18:36.880 --> 18:38.320
Public Santa is the name of the app.

18:38.320 --> 18:38.640
Okay.

18:38.640 --> 18:41.600
And they, and Public Santa, you say, I'm buying gifts for these people.

18:41.600 --> 18:43.440
Did they get me anything?

18:43.440 --> 18:45.200
And Public Santa tells you yes or no.

18:45.200 --> 18:46.880
And then it gives you an approximate dollar value.

18:46.880 --> 18:49.440
It's like that app where you put down whether or not you want to have

18:49.440 --> 18:50.960
a intercourse with one of your friends.

18:50.960 --> 18:52.720
And then if they want to have intercourse with you,

18:52.720 --> 18:55.120
they have tagged you and it will tell you if you have both.

18:55.120 --> 18:55.680
Exactly.

18:55.680 --> 18:56.160
It's exactly like that.

18:56.160 --> 18:57.600
Why don't I just make that the same app?

18:58.240 --> 19:00.160
Did I get them a gift and do I have a shot?

19:00.160 --> 19:04.240
You're just one button press away from the worst holiday season of your life.

19:04.240 --> 19:08.240
And what's great is it only says yes or no, but it doesn't say which one.

19:08.240 --> 19:15.360
I got you, Daryl, I got you some delightful artisanal jelly.

19:15.360 --> 19:18.320
Daryl, okay, I'm going to leave.

19:18.320 --> 19:19.200
I got to go.

19:19.200 --> 19:22.320
I will be, I got the wrong, I have to change my underwear.

19:22.320 --> 19:23.520
I have to be right back.

19:23.520 --> 19:26.560
I was wearing my special sexual underwear that was going to be your gift.

19:26.560 --> 19:27.920
It was going to have a picture of a bow on it.

19:27.920 --> 19:29.440
I have made some mistakes here.

19:29.440 --> 19:30.720
There has to be some crossover too.

19:30.720 --> 19:33.440
Cause you can say like, I did get Daryl a present, Public Santa.

19:33.440 --> 19:34.800
And Public Santa is like, don't worry.

19:34.800 --> 19:35.840
He's not getting you a present.

19:35.840 --> 19:40.480
But he would entertain the notion.

19:40.480 --> 19:47.200
Well, I think that you get Public Santa and then it's one letter off for the sexual one.

19:47.200 --> 19:53.840
Maybe Public Santa tells you if the person would accept sexual intercourse with you as

19:53.840 --> 19:57.600
a last resort if you can't think of any other gifts.

19:57.600 --> 19:58.960
So eventually you get hard up enough.

19:58.960 --> 19:59.920
You've looked at everywhere.

19:59.920 --> 20:05.280
You've been to TJ and TK Maxx for our UK friends and you can't find anything.

20:05.280 --> 20:07.760
And you're like, well, fine, be kind sexual intercourse.

20:07.760 --> 20:09.600
Here's the best thing about Public Santa.

20:09.600 --> 20:13.840
Because you have fed in the receipt for the gift that you have bought whenever you upload

20:13.840 --> 20:18.560
that you have bought this person a present via QR code because of technology.

20:19.360 --> 20:21.360
Maybe there's an NFC scan that goes on.

20:21.360 --> 20:22.560
This is all technology.

20:23.840 --> 20:25.920
And you don't plan on getting them a gift.

20:26.640 --> 20:30.880
You know that you can just give them like 52 bucks, 30 cents.

20:30.880 --> 20:35.760
And then you have just bought something from them as a secondhand vendor.

20:35.760 --> 20:37.360
Right, a gone consignment.

20:37.360 --> 20:38.560
It is gone consignment.

20:38.560 --> 20:41.600
And the gesture, yes, is nullified.

20:41.600 --> 20:43.440
But so is the potential awkwardness.

20:43.440 --> 20:45.520
Public Santa, 2013, grab it on the app store.

20:45.520 --> 20:46.800
It's $9.99.

20:46.800 --> 20:50.800
Don't like gift it to a friend because then you're just being kind of a jerk about it.

20:50.800 --> 20:53.680
And don't steal it just because we were too lazy to make it.

20:53.680 --> 20:56.640
Please cut us in on it when you actually do make this app.

20:56.640 --> 20:57.140
Please.

20:57.140 --> 21:00.260
It could work for other holidays, too, I guess.

21:00.820 --> 21:01.380
Maybe.

21:01.380 --> 21:04.900
Can we get a more easily trademarkable name like gift-o?

21:04.900 --> 21:05.400
Gift-o.

21:05.940 --> 21:06.820
Public gift-o.

21:07.700 --> 21:09.860
Why do you want to put public in there?

21:09.860 --> 21:10.900
Because it's not secret.

21:10.900 --> 21:11.620
It's public.

21:11.620 --> 21:12.740
It's out there.

21:12.740 --> 21:13.780
It's 20 dirt.

21:14.420 --> 21:15.700
We got it out.

21:15.700 --> 21:16.820
Sorry for burping, everyone.

21:16.820 --> 21:18.260
That's going to be tough to edit that one out.

21:19.300 --> 21:20.980
Oh, I got another question here.

21:20.980 --> 21:22.340
Happy camel nights, brothers.

21:22.340 --> 21:23.220
Hey, happy camel nights.

21:23.220 --> 21:25.460
How naked is too naked around?

21:25.460 --> 21:27.140
I like Griffin for some reason.

21:27.140 --> 21:32.020
We're on the drive time radio show because we're always like, hey, Christmas time is

21:32.020 --> 21:33.140
a special time of year.

21:33.140 --> 21:33.940
Caller, go ahead.

21:33.940 --> 21:36.340
Sometimes it's pretty rough.

21:36.340 --> 21:37.700
And here's a song for you.

21:37.700 --> 21:40.020
It's Do They Know It's Christmas Around the Clock.

21:40.020 --> 21:42.420
Because that's the only song I know how to play.

21:42.420 --> 21:45.060
I put that CD in and then I broke off the CD.

21:49.380 --> 21:50.420
Happy camel nights, brothers.

21:50.420 --> 21:52.260
How naked is too naked around, family?

21:52.260 --> 21:54.980
I'm invited to a friend's for the holidays.

21:54.980 --> 21:56.580
I have no family here.

21:56.580 --> 22:00.340
And well, last time I was there, his father opened the door wearing only his briefs.

22:00.340 --> 22:02.900
His sister came out of the shower with a towel around her waist.

22:02.900 --> 22:03.460
Nothing else.

22:04.180 --> 22:09.380
And his brother walked out of his room naked and said, hey, and held a short convo.

22:09.380 --> 22:10.900
You got to go.

22:10.900 --> 22:12.340
You got to go.

22:12.340 --> 22:13.620
Hop in the tourist and go.

22:14.420 --> 22:14.820
That's right.

22:14.820 --> 22:15.540
It's a Christmas song.

22:15.540 --> 22:16.820
Hop in the tourist and go.

22:17.940 --> 22:20.100
Your holidays are over now.

22:20.100 --> 22:24.740
Maybe if you swing by Golden Corral, there'll still be a few people there that you can

22:24.740 --> 22:25.620
exchange gifts with.

22:26.260 --> 22:29.380
I hope they want a pepper mill because that's what you bought.

22:32.660 --> 22:34.740
This is completely untenable.

22:34.740 --> 22:38.820
There is no question in my mind, if you're looking for some sort of societal reinforcement,

22:39.460 --> 22:43.780
nervous about nudity, that this is not normal.

22:43.780 --> 22:44.740
It's not normal.

22:44.740 --> 22:45.380
It's not right.

22:45.380 --> 22:47.300
Jesus, I've just figured it out.

22:47.300 --> 22:48.820
OK, here's my theory.

22:48.820 --> 22:52.580
Before you showed up to the house, their family got together and said, I can't believe that

22:52.580 --> 22:54.180
Susan is bringing her friend from college.

22:54.180 --> 22:55.940
We were just going to have a family Christmas.

22:55.940 --> 22:57.380
Well, how do we get him out of here?

22:57.380 --> 22:57.780
I know.

22:57.780 --> 22:58.420
I'll show him.

22:58.420 --> 22:59.940
I'll answer the door and adjust my briefs.

22:59.940 --> 23:02.020
And then the dad did it and you didn't leave.

23:02.020 --> 23:02.900
And he was like, I tried.

23:02.900 --> 23:04.260
And the daughter was like, OK, great.

23:04.260 --> 23:05.780
I'm going to go full bore.

23:05.780 --> 23:08.660
Just do the towel and have my boobs out and everything.

23:08.660 --> 23:09.780
And still didn't leave.

23:09.780 --> 23:13.940
And older brother was like, OK, I'm going to I'll take it to the next level.

23:13.940 --> 23:15.140
And then you still didn't leave.

23:15.140 --> 23:16.260
And they're like, well, we're stuck with her.

23:16.260 --> 23:20.420
This is like the adult version of pretending your house is haunted so your parents can't

23:20.420 --> 23:21.940
sell it, basically.

23:21.940 --> 23:25.300
And so God knows what they're going to do this year.

23:25.300 --> 23:29.140
When you show up, you show up and they've just sacrificed a goat in the living room

23:29.140 --> 23:31.540
and slather yourself with blood.

23:32.260 --> 23:33.460
Where are you going?

23:33.460 --> 23:35.060
You can eat the pancreas.

23:35.060 --> 23:40.580
And you're like, well, I guess when in Rome, when in Rome, not when in Rome, even in Rome,

23:40.580 --> 23:41.780
they put on some clothes.

23:41.780 --> 23:44.820
I'll be like, come on, put it away.

23:45.460 --> 23:46.500
Do we need all three?

23:48.980 --> 23:50.900
This is now here's the thing, though.

23:50.900 --> 23:55.620
You can not you can not try to meet them on this.

23:55.620 --> 23:57.780
You can not try to do more.

23:57.780 --> 23:59.860
Go toe to toe, literally.

23:59.860 --> 24:03.540
Or maybe you do because if they're trying to spook you, you need to be vigilant.

24:03.540 --> 24:05.060
You need to start peeling off layers.

24:05.060 --> 24:08.820
You need to you need to start humming the baseline with the most stone faced look.

24:08.820 --> 24:09.700
Just what?

24:09.700 --> 24:10.180
Say something.

24:10.180 --> 24:14.580
I want you to hum the baseline of three elevens, Amber, because that's a very erotically charged

24:14.580 --> 24:15.080
song.

24:16.980 --> 24:20.580
Maybe you can call the parents ahead of time and just say, like, just so I know, like,

24:20.580 --> 24:22.340
what is the deal over there this year?

24:22.340 --> 24:24.820
Did you guys get past that weird thing you were doing for a while?

24:24.820 --> 24:25.940
What are you into now?

24:25.940 --> 24:27.780
Maybe it's maybe it wasn't malicious, though.

24:27.780 --> 24:29.780
Maybe this was just a perfect storm.

24:29.780 --> 24:34.980
Now, the brother talking is like, it's like, no, you got to pose awkwardly against the

24:34.980 --> 24:36.660
doorframe when you guys are alone.

24:36.660 --> 24:37.460
Let me ask you a question.

24:37.460 --> 24:39.460
Was the conversation about how it's a little cold in here?

24:41.220 --> 24:44.420
When you guys are alone and this is going to get rippled.

24:44.420 --> 24:46.740
So like and we're not going to swear, but again, challenging thoughts.

24:46.740 --> 24:52.580
When you guys are nude, are you capable of doing anything except like the three or four

24:52.580 --> 24:56.100
things that you have to do to not be nude?

24:56.100 --> 24:59.140
Like for me, I couldn't hold a conversation with somebody.

24:59.140 --> 25:02.980
I couldn't like I couldn't I can't brush my own hair until I'm not nude anymore.

25:02.980 --> 25:05.780
It's like this animal instinct of like, I'm defenseless.

25:05.780 --> 25:08.420
I need to put up my chitin of sweaters.

25:08.420 --> 25:09.220
Do you know what I mean?

25:09.220 --> 25:13.700
If I could, I would set up a contraption right outside the shower that would allow me to

25:13.700 --> 25:15.940
spring directly into being fully clothed.

25:15.940 --> 25:20.500
If my clothes could be shot onto me with some sort of clothes gun.

25:22.820 --> 25:26.020
Griffin and his wife Rachel are staying with us for the holidays.

25:26.020 --> 25:30.420
I woke up at four in the morning to go use the bathroom and I put on a robe for that.

25:30.420 --> 25:35.300
Do you realize the statistical unlikelihood that I'd be seen even in my boxers?

25:35.300 --> 25:36.820
No, I'm putting on a robe.

25:36.820 --> 25:38.900
That's how demure we are in the memory house.

25:38.900 --> 25:39.940
I hope it was 4 a.m.

25:39.940 --> 25:40.420
You said.

25:40.420 --> 25:41.940
Yeah, I hope you were in earmuffs, too.

25:41.940 --> 25:43.380
Because it was cold outside.

25:43.380 --> 25:46.820
Candle nights, Christmas special, very, very family friendly episode.

25:46.820 --> 25:48.900
We would never talk about the thing you thought we talked about.

25:48.900 --> 25:50.180
How about another Yahoo, Griffin?

25:50.180 --> 25:51.300
How about another Yahoo?

25:51.300 --> 25:57.140
This Yahoo was sent in by Nick Key or K. Thank you, Nick.

25:58.020 --> 25:59.140
Sorry, it's hard to read the screen.

25:59.780 --> 26:00.340
Thank you, Nick.

26:00.340 --> 26:05.940
It's by Yahoo answers user who asks, What are you getting your horse in there?

26:05.940 --> 26:10.740
This is S. So either your singular horse or your single horse.

26:10.740 --> 26:13.380
Either your singular horse or plural horses.

26:13.380 --> 26:15.220
What are you getting your singularity horse?

26:15.220 --> 26:18.420
OK, guys, I don't want to embarrass you all, but I would swear to God,

26:18.420 --> 26:20.420
we talked about what you get a horse as a present.

26:20.980 --> 26:24.980
Then we talk about what you got a horse for a Secret Santa.

26:24.980 --> 26:25.220
OK.

26:25.220 --> 26:26.020
Oh, did we really?

26:26.020 --> 26:26.340
We did.

26:26.340 --> 26:27.060
What did you get your horse?

26:27.060 --> 26:28.340
But this is for your own horse.

26:28.340 --> 26:30.420
You know this horse backward and forward.

26:30.420 --> 26:30.740
Yeah.

26:30.740 --> 26:33.060
Well, it also says in your other animals, too.

26:33.060 --> 26:35.700
So for dogs, they've gotten bones in a toy.

26:35.700 --> 26:35.940
Wow.

26:35.940 --> 26:37.540
Really thought outside the box on that one.

26:38.180 --> 26:39.460
Show the dog you know him.

26:39.460 --> 26:41.060
I got you this Bill Bryson book.

26:41.060 --> 26:41.700
My three fish.

26:41.700 --> 26:43.780
Well, one needs more buddies because he's a schooling fish.

26:43.780 --> 26:46.500
The other two need buddies also and plants, too, to make them happy.

26:46.500 --> 26:48.180
I might also get a couple of decorations.

26:48.180 --> 26:49.220
They're fish.

26:49.220 --> 26:49.860
They're fish.

26:49.860 --> 26:51.300
Can I also throw this out?

26:51.300 --> 26:55.620
If your fish needs these things to be happy, why are you waiting till Christmas?

26:55.620 --> 26:58.260
It doesn't understand that you're waiting till Christmas.

26:58.260 --> 26:59.940
It's just sitting like, I'm so lonely.

26:59.940 --> 27:01.700
It doesn't understand being deprived.

27:01.700 --> 27:02.260
Yeah.

27:02.260 --> 27:04.180
Oh, I guess I'm just waiting for Christmas.

27:04.180 --> 27:05.540
A concept I fully grasp.

27:06.580 --> 27:07.380
Lastly, my horse.

27:07.380 --> 27:08.660
I need new saddle pads.

27:08.660 --> 27:10.020
I want a new halter.

27:10.020 --> 27:11.540
That is not a present for the horse.

27:11.540 --> 27:14.500
You're buying yourself horse accoutrement.

27:14.500 --> 27:15.380
Don't kid yourself.

27:15.380 --> 27:20.980
To protect your gins while you're doing this thing that the horse definitely hates.

27:20.980 --> 27:25.940
That's like saying, Darla, I buy you a new backpack so you can carry my stuff around.

27:25.940 --> 27:26.740
Merry Christmas.

27:26.740 --> 27:30.260
If your mailman stabbed you every time you dropped off your mail, you'd be like,

27:30.260 --> 27:31.300
Merry Christmas, mailman.

27:31.300 --> 27:33.940
I got you a bigger knife to stab me with.

27:33.940 --> 27:39.460
Travis, it would be like getting someone a backpack to carry your stuff around, except

27:39.460 --> 27:41.300
by your stuff, you mean you.

27:41.300 --> 27:43.220
Darla, I got you a bigger backpack to put me in.

27:43.220 --> 27:45.460
I got you an adult Bjorn for me.

27:45.460 --> 27:46.820
Let me just hop up in there.

27:47.620 --> 27:48.820
You know what I noticed this year?

27:48.820 --> 27:51.060
You were too unladen with my girth.

27:52.340 --> 27:53.700
You're walking a little too tall.

27:54.900 --> 27:55.940
I'm going to break you.

27:55.940 --> 27:57.060
2014.

27:57.060 --> 27:59.380
Any recommendations for my barn friends?

27:59.380 --> 28:03.060
Last year I got them all gifts, but $25 for five people is too much to spend.

28:03.060 --> 28:03.780
What do you recommend?

28:03.780 --> 28:04.740
Thanks for the help.

28:04.740 --> 28:07.460
Are barn friends people they've murdered in the barn?

28:08.420 --> 28:10.660
Are these the ghosts of barn deaths?

28:10.660 --> 28:16.340
Or are barn friends the friends they've created in said barn from murdering other people?

28:16.340 --> 28:18.340
Out of pieces of animals, no.

28:19.300 --> 28:20.980
This is my barn friend, Ow Pig.

28:22.340 --> 28:23.220
You know what I did here?

28:23.220 --> 28:24.420
The proportions are all off.

28:24.420 --> 28:26.420
These two animals are very differently sized.

28:26.420 --> 28:29.460
I think I got them a gun and the courage to do what's right.

28:29.460 --> 28:35.060
I think these are actually terrible human-animal hybrids, Dr. Moreau style.

28:35.060 --> 28:37.300
They've created and now live in the rafters.

28:37.940 --> 28:40.900
From the creators of Pound Puppies, it's Barn Friend.

28:40.900 --> 28:42.020
Oh, we're closed.

28:42.020 --> 28:43.140
Our business is closed.

28:43.140 --> 28:44.580
Merry Christmas, Barn Friend.

28:44.580 --> 28:45.460
Kill us.

28:45.460 --> 28:47.060
Please, I'm a Donkey Man.

28:47.060 --> 28:48.580
Please call my children.

28:48.580 --> 28:49.860
Tell them where I am.

28:49.860 --> 28:50.900
Kill Donkey Man.

28:50.900 --> 28:52.340
Okay, Merry Christmas, Donkey Man.

28:52.340 --> 28:54.420
I know where you should get Donkey Man for Christmas.

28:54.420 --> 28:55.300
Kill Donkey Man.

28:55.300 --> 28:56.100
Kill Donkey Man.

28:56.100 --> 28:58.340
Also oats maybe would be nice.

28:58.340 --> 29:00.900
Some artisanal stone-cut oats.

29:00.900 --> 29:02.900
Here's the thing, I'm gluten intolerant.

29:03.540 --> 29:05.060
Kill Donkey Man.

29:05.060 --> 29:07.220
I'm allergic to donkeys, ironically.

29:09.620 --> 29:10.580
Should we go to the Money Zone?

29:10.580 --> 29:12.420
It feels kind of crass to do that in Candle Nights.

29:12.420 --> 29:12.900
Not to me.

29:12.900 --> 29:14.020
I gotta pay for these presents.

29:14.020 --> 29:14.980
I got you guys somehow.

29:25.700 --> 29:26.900
Your family's in town.

29:26.900 --> 29:28.020
You don't know what to do with them.

29:28.020 --> 29:28.500
It's okay.

29:28.500 --> 29:30.100
We can relate.

29:30.100 --> 29:31.780
I don't know what to do with these guys.

29:31.780 --> 29:34.740
We'll just sit around chatting for a while, then I'll wait it out.

29:34.740 --> 29:37.460
This is our fourth podcast recorded just to kill time.

29:37.460 --> 29:38.900
We threw the other three away.

29:40.420 --> 29:41.620
But here's the good news for you.

29:41.620 --> 29:42.580
You don't have to be like us.

29:42.580 --> 29:43.620
You try to Hulu.com.

29:43.620 --> 29:44.180
That's fine.

29:44.180 --> 29:46.820
But why don't you elevate your game to Hulu Plus.

29:47.460 --> 29:50.500
You can watch your favorite shows anytime, anywhere.

29:51.780 --> 29:55.940
SNL, Jimmy Kimmel Live, Shark Tank, Scandal, Backdated.

29:55.940 --> 30:01.060
Like you can binge on Lawn Mower SVU, Lost, Doctor Who, Community.

30:01.060 --> 30:02.500
And they've got an original series, too.

30:02.500 --> 30:06.340
Like The Wrong Man and Behind the Mask, which is the docuseries about what, Travis?

30:06.340 --> 30:08.980
It's about mascots, Justin, and the people inside of them.

30:08.980 --> 30:10.420
The people inside the mascots.

30:11.860 --> 30:12.660
The barn friends.

30:12.660 --> 30:13.140
The barn friends.

30:13.140 --> 30:13.860
Sports world.

30:13.860 --> 30:17.140
This is basically an insane amount of entertainment for $8 a month.

30:17.140 --> 30:17.860
Uh-oh.

30:17.860 --> 30:21.140
Binge on old favorites or catch a movie.

30:21.140 --> 30:22.900
And here's the best part about it.

30:22.900 --> 30:26.980
For our Christmas gift to you, we're going to give you two weeks free.

30:26.980 --> 30:27.460
You're welcome.

30:27.460 --> 30:32.500
Go to HuluPlus.com slash my brother and get an extended two week free trial.

30:32.500 --> 30:35.460
That's HuluPlus.com slash my brother.

30:35.460 --> 30:38.100
Go get into Hulu Plus now and entertain your family.

30:38.100 --> 30:41.540
And you may be like me and sit there and think, oh, I've done Hulu before.

30:41.540 --> 30:46.580
But trust me, man, the amount of back catalog they've got now, it's incredible.

30:46.580 --> 30:50.740
So you're watching TV, HuluPlus.com.

30:50.740 --> 30:54.660
You're watching this stuff streamed on your Xbox 360 or what have you.

30:54.660 --> 30:57.460
But you get a little snack attack.

30:57.460 --> 30:58.340
Get a little peckish.

30:58.340 --> 30:59.380
Snack attack.

30:59.380 --> 31:01.300
Reaching my drawer butt junk.

31:01.300 --> 31:06.580
I have an insane amount of nature box snacks, and I'm ready for the holidays.

31:06.580 --> 31:13.300
They basically delivered French toast granola I have, salted caramel pretzel pops I had.

31:13.300 --> 31:15.300
Should I just go downstairs and get some nature box?

31:15.300 --> 31:17.860
Yeah, let's stop doing this stupid show.

31:17.860 --> 31:19.140
Nature doesn't sound tasty.

31:19.140 --> 31:21.220
I want to eat my big bag of cheesy crackling.

31:21.220 --> 31:23.140
You're stupid, Griffin.

31:23.140 --> 31:24.420
You're stupid for Christmas.

31:24.420 --> 31:26.500
It's the new cheese snack from Shia LaBeouf.

31:26.500 --> 31:27.300
Don't be an idiot.

31:27.300 --> 31:29.300
This isn't rabbit food, you idiot.

31:29.300 --> 31:30.740
You stupid butt face.

31:30.740 --> 31:33.060
There's just no trans fats or high fructose corn syrup.

31:33.060 --> 31:33.780
It's not artificial.

31:33.780 --> 31:37.700
It's just real natural snacks that you can enjoy.

31:37.700 --> 31:41.140
And it ships to you for free monthly like a subscription service.

31:41.140 --> 31:42.980
You can switch up your snacks whenever you want.

31:43.940 --> 31:45.780
H1 comes in like a nice stay fresh pouch.

31:45.780 --> 31:47.620
You can reseal when you're done eating.

31:47.620 --> 31:51.780
And then you can use the box afterwards for, I don't know, dioramas or whatever you want.

31:51.780 --> 31:52.340
Diarrhea.

31:52.340 --> 31:53.780
You can use it for diarrhea.

31:53.780 --> 31:55.860
You won't get diarrhea from these snacks, guaranteed.

31:55.860 --> 31:57.220
But you might get them from your Buff Puffs.

31:57.780 --> 32:00.660
Buff Puffs, actually that's like their guarantee is that they will give you diarrhea.

32:00.660 --> 32:04.980
They're like the joke candy from Harry Potter that you eat to get diarrhea to get out of school.

32:04.980 --> 32:08.180
Your first order of nature box is going to be 50% off thanks to us.

32:08.180 --> 32:12.100
You're going to use the promo code MYBROTHER, that's the one word, at naturebox.com.

32:12.100 --> 32:14.820
You're going to get your first order 50% off.

32:14.820 --> 32:18.100
Keep your hand out of the vending machine because they'll get stuck and you'll lose it.

32:18.100 --> 32:18.740
And it'll pull over.

32:18.740 --> 32:20.660
A lot of people die from vending machines every year.

32:20.660 --> 32:23.780
That's actually what happened in that movie 128 hours.

32:23.780 --> 32:25.060
Is that the right number of hours?

32:25.060 --> 32:25.940
That was extra hours.

32:25.940 --> 32:27.380
That was the sequel.

32:28.500 --> 32:33.700
We got a personal message here from Hamish.

32:33.700 --> 32:34.660
Hamish.

32:34.660 --> 32:35.700
It's going out to Richard.

32:37.700 --> 32:38.500
Dear Hamish.

32:38.500 --> 32:39.540
Travis, will you read this one for me?

32:39.540 --> 32:40.180
Because I feel like you do.

32:40.180 --> 32:41.620
There's messages for Hamish.

32:42.500 --> 32:44.260
I mean, I said that stuff already.

32:44.260 --> 32:46.740
But I'm trying to set up a certain feeling in the air.

32:46.740 --> 32:47.300
Get a vibe.

32:47.300 --> 32:48.100
Get a rhythm.

32:48.100 --> 32:49.220
Let me start over.

32:49.220 --> 32:52.100
This message is for Hamish from Richard.

32:52.100 --> 32:58.660
Dear, dear, AKA Hamish, AKA USC heavy boy, AKA weeaboo dad.

32:58.660 --> 33:02.340
If you guys are secretly making us say racist stuff, we'll never forgive you.

33:02.340 --> 33:05.060
Wishing you a very, oh goodness.

33:05.060 --> 33:07.380
Heavy boys keep taking all my jobs.

33:07.380 --> 33:10.580
A very GVCCI birth-iversary.

33:10.580 --> 33:11.860
I think it's supposed to be Gucci.

33:11.860 --> 33:13.780
Okay, a very Gucci birth-iversary.

33:13.780 --> 33:15.620
And a custom prime 24th year.

33:15.620 --> 33:18.900
Real proud of you for getting over that unemployment thing you are doing.

33:18.900 --> 33:25.940
And calm cats in the cradle-ulations on your dad ending his tours.

33:25.940 --> 33:28.420
Expecting big things from you in 14.

33:28.420 --> 33:30.420
Lots of love from your boy, Rich Dog.

33:31.220 --> 33:31.860
Okay, listen.

33:32.500 --> 33:33.700
Listen, Richard.

33:33.700 --> 33:38.660
If we just gave a secret order to assassinate the president, we will never forgive you.

33:40.180 --> 33:41.860
We cannot be party to that.

33:41.860 --> 33:45.460
Did he say Gucci birth-iversary or GVCCI birth-iversary?

33:45.460 --> 33:50.980
We just activated a very, very racist splinter cell somewhere.

33:50.980 --> 33:52.340
This is completely untenable.

33:52.340 --> 33:53.700
We gotta kill all the heavy boys.

33:53.700 --> 33:55.460
Oh no.

33:55.460 --> 33:56.020
Not again.

33:56.020 --> 33:57.140
Not that language, please.

33:57.140 --> 33:58.340
I have to go into hiding now.

33:58.340 --> 33:59.220
It's candle lights.

34:00.420 --> 34:01.380
Happy birthday, Richard.

34:01.380 --> 34:03.060
Happy birthday, Hamish.

34:03.060 --> 34:04.260
Happy birthday, Hamish.

34:04.260 --> 34:07.140
And happy losing your money to us, Richard.

34:07.140 --> 34:11.380
And happy assassination of a public figure, Richard.

34:12.340 --> 34:13.300
Got another message, Griffin.

34:13.300 --> 34:14.660
Who's it for and from?

34:14.660 --> 34:19.140
This one is for Andrew Considine and Hannah Beckman.

34:19.140 --> 34:20.820
And it's from Hannah Beckman.

34:21.780 --> 34:23.060
And Andrew Considine.

34:23.060 --> 34:24.660
Did we just get conned a bit?

34:24.660 --> 34:25.380
Rabbit hole.

34:26.340 --> 34:29.460
Happy birthday to Hannah from Andrew and Andrew from Hannah.

34:29.460 --> 34:34.740
And to all the other November babies out there, missed it by that much.

34:34.740 --> 34:38.180
We are almost in the next month that we almost missed it by.

34:39.940 --> 34:42.900
Hannah is a historic preservationist out of Buffalo, NY.

34:42.900 --> 34:44.100
She protects buffaloes.

34:44.100 --> 34:47.060
And Andrew is a graphic designer in Erie, PA.

34:47.620 --> 34:48.580
And what is that?

34:48.580 --> 34:49.860
Is that Pennsylvania?

34:50.500 --> 34:50.820
Yeah.

34:50.820 --> 34:51.140
Is it?

34:51.140 --> 34:51.620
Yeah.

34:51.620 --> 34:52.420
No, it's pop.

34:52.420 --> 34:53.060
It's pomaine.

34:54.340 --> 34:56.340
And although they live apart, their favorite thing to do

34:56.340 --> 34:57.780
is listen to my bim bam together.

34:57.780 --> 34:58.020
Thanks for the laughs.

34:58.020 --> 35:02.500
Even though I know how very far apart we are,

35:02.500 --> 35:07.140
it helps to think we might be listening to the same great show.

35:08.500 --> 35:08.900
Griffin.

35:09.860 --> 35:10.980
Thanks for the laughs.

35:11.620 --> 35:12.420
Sometimes.

35:13.940 --> 35:15.220
And happy birthday to us.

35:15.220 --> 35:17.060
Also, you both owe us $50.

35:17.060 --> 35:20.820
You both owe us $50,000 if we're gonna pay for the rights.

35:20.820 --> 35:21.860
That was not fair use.

35:21.860 --> 35:23.940
It was not parodic because it was not funny.

35:27.220 --> 35:30.500
Do you think it's okay to finish someone else's food?

35:30.500 --> 35:32.820
Do you have a fight with your friend over whether or not

35:32.820 --> 35:36.020
he should wear his Philly's garb to a Colorado Rockies game?

35:36.900 --> 35:40.900
Does your wife want to keep a chamber pot in her art studio?

35:40.900 --> 35:44.340
If so, please do not write in to Judge John Hodgman.

35:44.340 --> 35:45.860
I heard all those cases already.

35:46.660 --> 35:49.540
Judge John Hodgman is the show where I, John Hodgman,

35:49.540 --> 35:54.020
adjudicate disputes between real people calling in over the internet.

35:54.020 --> 35:57.780
And I tell them who is right and who is wrong over such important issues

35:57.780 --> 36:02.580
as is a machine gun a robot and is it okay to go through the garbage

36:02.580 --> 36:04.580
at the Canadian House of Pizza and Garbage?

36:05.300 --> 36:09.140
Bailiff Jesse Thorne rounds out the cast for a fun-filled podcast

36:09.140 --> 36:12.340
of Judgment and Justice.

36:12.340 --> 36:14.420
Kind of two of the same thing, actually.

36:14.420 --> 36:17.940
Judge John Hodgman, take a listen if you do not mind.

36:17.940 --> 36:18.980
I order it.

36:18.980 --> 36:20.180
Come visit the courtroom.

36:20.180 --> 36:24.660
It is open to all and located at MaximumFun.org.

36:24.660 --> 36:32.020
Uh, here's another question from, uh, let's see.

36:32.580 --> 36:33.300
Here we go.

36:33.300 --> 36:36.580
Dear my brothers, what is the history genesis, if you will, of candle lights?

36:36.580 --> 36:38.260
Would you say it's the next step of the natural evolution,

36:38.260 --> 36:39.780
the so-called war on Christmas?

36:39.780 --> 36:42.820
Or rather, does it represent the satirical and ironic sentiment

36:42.820 --> 36:46.180
that has saturated popular culture for the last couple of decades?

36:46.180 --> 36:47.220
There is nothing.

36:47.220 --> 36:48.820
Oh, I'm, I'm kind of angry now.

36:48.820 --> 36:50.820
So you've just made me angry on my favorite holiday.

36:50.820 --> 36:53.140
There's nothing satirical or ironic about candle lights at all.

36:53.140 --> 36:53.700
Hey Scrooge.

36:53.700 --> 36:55.460
How's your, how's your candle lights, Scrooge?

36:55.460 --> 36:57.300
Jeremy, I hate to come at you like this.

36:57.300 --> 36:59.140
Here's what candle lights is all about.

36:59.140 --> 37:01.620
I'll sum it up for you in, in direct terms.

37:01.620 --> 37:06.260
Candle lights is about stripping away the, the religious boundaries

37:06.260 --> 37:09.140
that have, have defined this holiday season.

37:09.140 --> 37:13.700
And instead saying, hey, we all just want to be happy together for a couple weeks.

37:13.700 --> 37:15.220
Can we just have a nice candle light?

37:15.220 --> 37:18.340
It is, it is, it's the end of the war on Christmas is what it is.

37:18.340 --> 37:19.780
Because like, it's kind of like when-

37:19.780 --> 37:22.180
It's the Geneva convention of the war on Christmas.

37:22.180 --> 37:27.060
When rebel and union soldiers got together and they did that, the Treaty of Versailles,

37:27.060 --> 37:30.660
and they like patched things up and they're like, it's time for a new America

37:30.660 --> 37:31.940
where the two of us can work together.

37:31.940 --> 37:33.700
Maybe we'll have a little bit of slavery.

37:33.700 --> 37:35.780
Maybe we could have just like a little bit of slavery on the side.

37:35.780 --> 37:37.700
And Winston Churchill negotiated the deal.

37:37.700 --> 37:42.420
Give us just South Carolina to just still run rampant and go crazy, crazy.

37:42.420 --> 37:48.740
Give us Florida to just like do some experimentation with like how a state can possibly work.

37:48.740 --> 37:51.220
Give us those two states and then like, we'll do the rest.

37:51.220 --> 37:54.740
Yes, we will abolish slavery in the other like 14 states that we had, we had peace.

37:54.740 --> 37:56.980
We're going to keep a light amount of tasteful slavery.

37:56.980 --> 38:00.020
We're going to keep a light amount of slavery in South Carolina, Florida.

38:00.020 --> 38:02.020
We are just going to make it the wasteland.

38:02.020 --> 38:03.060
They can do what they want.

38:03.060 --> 38:04.500
They're going to get super hot crimes.

38:04.500 --> 38:05.940
Good news, they can have Disney.

38:05.940 --> 38:07.220
They can have Disney.

38:07.220 --> 38:12.100
Give us just a place where just like, give us a George Zimmerman wonderland is all that we want.

38:12.100 --> 38:14.340
And if we do that, then we'll do the rest of the other stuff.

38:14.340 --> 38:16.500
And then they came together, they agreed on it, they shook hands.

38:16.500 --> 38:21.140
And then they had a new, arguably not as great, but definitely more stable America.

38:21.140 --> 38:22.260
That's what Candle Nights is.

38:22.260 --> 38:24.980
It's not as good as any of the holidays, but it's better than no holiday.

38:24.980 --> 38:25.780
But you know what it is?

38:25.780 --> 38:28.420
It's not going to, I'm not going to see people on Facebook saying like,

38:28.420 --> 38:31.140
oh, I don't see why we have to say Merry Candle Nights.

38:31.140 --> 38:32.740
Candle Nights isn't for another two weeks.

38:32.740 --> 38:34.660
Christmas is two days closer than Candle Nights.

38:34.660 --> 38:35.860
So maybe we should just.

38:35.860 --> 38:38.900
Or someone saying like, I can't believe you said Merry Candle Nights to me.

38:38.900 --> 38:41.220
Say, it's like, no, it's all encompassed.

38:41.220 --> 38:43.300
It begins exactly when you want it to.

38:43.300 --> 38:44.660
It ends when you tire of it.

38:44.660 --> 38:49.860
It's the most wonderful holiday because it's like a choose your own adventure holiday.

38:49.860 --> 38:54.820
Who is the Brazilian governor dude that was like, guess what?

38:54.820 --> 38:58.340
Christmas holiday kicks off like middle of November officially

38:58.340 --> 38:59.940
because we want people to be happy.

38:59.940 --> 39:03.300
We want you to have like a super, super long Christmas time.

39:03.300 --> 39:06.900
Like that guy is the Pope of Candle Nights.

39:06.900 --> 39:11.540
You know the weird thing about, it pops off in the UK early.

39:11.540 --> 39:15.940
Like we were there in the mid to late November, pre Thanksgiving.

39:15.940 --> 39:16.900
And it was already.

39:16.900 --> 39:17.700
They don't have Thanksgiving.

39:17.700 --> 39:18.500
I know, I know.

39:18.500 --> 39:19.380
There's no wall.

39:19.380 --> 39:20.100
There's no barrier.

39:20.100 --> 39:20.900
There's no barrier to it.

39:20.900 --> 39:24.740
They go into pre-pro on the Doctor Who Christmas special in like late July.

39:24.740 --> 39:26.820
And then they have to start doing it then.

39:26.820 --> 39:27.460
They have to.

39:28.500 --> 39:30.660
So that is where Candle Nights comes from.

39:30.660 --> 39:33.220
Griffin, do you have a hot Yahoo popping off or should I read another question?

39:33.220 --> 39:36.260
I have a hot and ready Yahoo to pop off for you guys.

39:36.260 --> 39:38.100
It's a $5 hot and ready Yahoo.

39:38.100 --> 39:39.700
Sent in by Nick Key also.

39:39.700 --> 39:40.580
It is Jermaine.

39:40.580 --> 39:41.220
Hear me out.

39:41.220 --> 39:42.180
You're going to get angry.

39:43.060 --> 39:43.780
Thank you, Nick Key.

39:43.780 --> 39:45.860
It's by Yahoo Answers User Sooners83.

39:45.860 --> 39:46.580
You hear that, Trav?

39:46.580 --> 39:47.460
Yeah, boomer.

39:47.460 --> 39:50.260
Dr. Up, a Little Caesars hot and ready, he asks.

39:50.260 --> 39:53.140
Now, I know a lot of you are wondering, how does this fit in?

39:53.140 --> 39:58.660
Same as like you watch Hulu to like get through the holidays, to get through like the boring times.

39:58.660 --> 40:00.180
We need to do something.

40:00.180 --> 40:04.180
If you need to, if there's hungry times on the holidays, maybe you're not much of a chef.

40:05.140 --> 40:07.620
Maybe you can't make a Christmas moose.

40:08.260 --> 40:08.740
What do you do?

40:08.740 --> 40:10.020
You roll down to the Little Caesars.

40:10.020 --> 40:11.220
You get $5 hot and ready.

40:11.220 --> 40:15.700
Nobody is going to be impressed though, if you have a plain Jane.

40:15.700 --> 40:22.180
Pepperoni or cheese or do they even do sausage at the hot and ready?

40:22.180 --> 40:23.620
They'll do pretty much anything you want to.

40:23.620 --> 40:27.060
What I love about the hot and ready and no questions asked.

40:27.060 --> 40:32.980
Rachel and I were doing a party the other month and we got two pizzas and it wasn't enough to feed our guests.

40:32.980 --> 40:35.220
And we live literally across the street from Little Caesars.

40:35.220 --> 40:38.500
So we walked in there and they're like, hot and ready, you want it?

40:38.500 --> 40:39.620
And I was like, yeah, I'll have a cheese.

40:39.620 --> 40:42.580
They're like, we only have pepperoni because that's the only pizza we make here.

40:42.580 --> 40:43.940
It's the only one anyone asks for.

40:43.940 --> 40:46.260
Like, how much do we have to wait for the cheese?

40:46.260 --> 40:47.540
And they said five minutes.

40:47.540 --> 40:49.860
And we said, okay, we can wait five.

40:49.860 --> 40:51.140
It's against the slogan.

40:51.140 --> 40:52.660
So it's a hot and almost ready.

40:52.660 --> 40:56.180
We will wait five minutes to get the type of hot and ready pizza we want.

40:56.180 --> 40:59.620
So we sat down in the only two chairs because like, nobody sit.

40:59.620 --> 41:02.500
Longest five minutes of your entire life.

41:02.500 --> 41:04.660
The staff is staring at you going, I think I'll leave.

41:04.660 --> 41:06.740
In this five minute period, we were waiting.

41:07.220 --> 41:13.140
Two different people came into the Little Caesars, said, I would like a cheese or a sausage.

41:13.140 --> 41:15.060
They said, we only have pepperoni.

41:15.060 --> 41:16.260
It'll take five minutes.

41:16.260 --> 41:20.020
And they said, I guess I'll just take the pepperoni then.

41:20.020 --> 41:25.060
Like, you are eating a Little Caesars pepperoni pizza at, it was like 9.30 at night.

41:25.060 --> 41:26.900
How tight did they time out their evening?

41:26.900 --> 41:29.220
Oh, I gotta go.

41:29.220 --> 41:31.780
I gotta get to the governor's mansion at 9.45.

41:31.780 --> 41:34.020
I got that ball starting at 9.45.

41:34.020 --> 41:34.820
Can't be late.

41:34.820 --> 41:39.060
Both people were willing to compromise and it wasn't, the most shocking thing is that

41:39.060 --> 41:43.460
they compromised in front of me or Rachel, who were sitting there like, mm, tut, tut.

41:43.460 --> 41:47.700
Like, mm, couldn't kick it for five to get the, I guess you could just take the stuff

41:47.700 --> 41:50.500
off and it'll still have the, the, the leavings of pepperoni on it.

41:50.500 --> 41:53.140
Oh, cotillion starts in 20 minutes, I gotta go.

41:53.140 --> 41:54.980
Oh, it was such a bummer.

41:54.980 --> 41:59.220
But listen, you can, you gotta take these pizzas, and this is something that not many

41:59.220 --> 42:02.820
people do, but you gotta take it and chop and screw it.

42:02.820 --> 42:03.620
What about this?

42:03.620 --> 42:06.180
Get two hot and ready, stuck them together, chop them together.

42:06.180 --> 42:06.820
Calzones.

42:06.820 --> 42:07.460
Calzones.

42:07.460 --> 42:08.020
I got it.

42:08.020 --> 42:11.140
Everybody loves the Papa John's thin crust, because when you get a Papa John's thin crust,

42:11.140 --> 42:15.860
you get this special packet of seasoning, but I'm here to tell you, as a special candle

42:15.860 --> 42:18.180
night's gift from me to you, you can just fake that.

42:18.180 --> 42:19.300
Here's what you're gonna do.

42:19.300 --> 42:23.460
You're taking this off a website, you looked up and it has three out of five stars, so

42:23.460 --> 42:25.540
like, already its accuracy is suspect.

42:25.540 --> 42:29.380
Two tablespoons paprika, two tablespoons salt, two tablespoons garlic powder, one tablespoon

42:29.380 --> 42:32.420
black pepper, one tablespoon onion powder, one tablespoon cayenne pepper, one tablespoon

42:32.420 --> 42:34.580
dried oregano, one tablespoon dried thyme.

42:34.580 --> 42:35.380
Now mix that all up.

42:35.380 --> 42:36.660
I don't want to put you on blast, Justin.

42:36.660 --> 42:40.820
I don't want to put you on blast, Justin, but it's two and a half tablespoons of paprika.

42:40.820 --> 42:42.020
Somebody just made that.

42:42.020 --> 42:44.340
They finished it after you started saying dried thyme.

42:44.340 --> 42:47.220
They're like, let's make this up, and they taste it, and they said, I've been lied to

42:47.220 --> 42:47.460
by them.

42:47.460 --> 42:51.220
I also want to throw out, on this website, it lists the prep time as five minutes.

42:51.220 --> 42:53.540
Five minutes.

42:53.540 --> 42:54.660
Which one's oregano again?

42:54.660 --> 42:57.860
There's a lot of measuring going on, but you get that, make that into a container.

42:57.860 --> 43:02.180
I had a container of that for a long time, and I'm out now, but now I'm gonna make more.

43:02.180 --> 43:03.620
I know what somebody's getting for candle night.

43:03.620 --> 43:05.780
Why did you put that, fess up thyme.

43:05.780 --> 43:07.140
Here comes taxicab confessions.

43:07.140 --> 43:12.100
To the McElroy brothers, tell me exactly the kinds of foods you would put this homemade

43:12.100 --> 43:14.580
Papa John seasoning on.

43:14.580 --> 43:17.620
Your father Johnny's off-brand seasoning.

43:17.620 --> 43:18.180
Okay.

43:18.180 --> 43:18.900
Pizza.

43:18.900 --> 43:19.140
Yeah.

43:19.860 --> 43:20.260
Pizza.

43:21.060 --> 43:22.180
Centric Hot Pockets.

43:23.300 --> 43:26.820
Italian meatball Hot Pockets, because those are basically pizza Hot Pockets.

43:26.820 --> 43:30.260
You just went down the oubliette of sadness.

43:30.260 --> 43:30.900
Let them finish.

43:31.700 --> 43:32.020
Chicken.

43:32.740 --> 43:33.700
That could actually be all right.

43:33.700 --> 43:34.100
Beef.

43:34.100 --> 43:38.180
Beef, chicken and beef pizza, and pizza.

43:38.900 --> 43:39.220
That's it.

43:40.980 --> 43:44.020
You didn't make a pasta once, and you didn't try and experiment.

43:44.020 --> 43:44.900
You didn't put it on pizza doughnuts.

43:44.900 --> 43:45.620
It's good and everything.

43:45.620 --> 43:47.780
Did you make quesadillas once, and you're like, let me just...

43:47.780 --> 43:48.420
Pizzadillas.

43:48.420 --> 43:50.660
No, it's like a pizza seasoning.

43:50.660 --> 43:55.940
I put it in a jar that I wrote pizza seasoning on the top of it, and there, that's it.

43:55.940 --> 43:56.980
That's the whole thing.

43:56.980 --> 43:57.940
That's the whole kit and caboodle.

43:57.940 --> 44:01.540
Go make that seasoning, and you'll be like, wow, this is a very convincing replication.

44:01.540 --> 44:02.100
Here's my seasoning.

44:02.100 --> 44:02.660
Ready?

44:02.660 --> 44:04.660
Put some veggie oil on hot.

44:04.660 --> 44:05.700
Get it hot.

44:05.700 --> 44:07.300
Get it to where you put a chopstick in it.

44:07.300 --> 44:10.100
You get a steady stream of bubbles, but it doesn't go crazy.

44:10.100 --> 44:12.500
Then you've got to bread some artichoke hearts.

44:12.500 --> 44:13.220
Throw those in there.

44:13.220 --> 44:14.500
Slap that on your pizza.

44:14.500 --> 44:15.460
Merry Candle Nights.

44:16.020 --> 44:18.340
Hello, and happy Candle Nights to the three wise brothers.

44:18.340 --> 44:22.660
I seek advice regarding how to handle tiny holiday celebrations.

44:24.820 --> 44:28.820
Each year, our extended family Candle Nights party has five to eight people,

44:29.620 --> 44:31.940
but due to a perfect storm of scheduling conflicts,

44:31.940 --> 44:34.340
I'll be the only person traveling to my parents' place.

44:34.340 --> 44:39.220
Do you have any advice as to how to celebrate the most joys of times with only your parents?

44:39.220 --> 44:41.060
That's from Jim in Jersey City.

44:41.060 --> 44:44.100
P.S. There will be a limit of two games to take it to ride.

44:44.100 --> 44:48.020
You have to open everyone's presents that aren't there and claim them as your own.

44:48.980 --> 44:50.580
Oh, Susan missed it this year?

44:50.580 --> 44:51.540
This is mine.

44:52.100 --> 44:53.300
These are mine.

44:53.300 --> 44:55.060
Now I have a foot massager.

44:55.700 --> 44:59.700
I have three foot massagers because our parents aren't creative with the gift giving.

44:59.700 --> 45:02.980
I, how do you, broader question.

45:02.980 --> 45:06.900
How do you do anything with only a party of three people?

45:06.900 --> 45:08.500
Oh, let me throw this out.

45:08.500 --> 45:12.340
Excuse yourself to the bedroom several times with several costume changes.

45:12.340 --> 45:14.820
Come back as your brothers and sisters routinely.

45:14.820 --> 45:16.180
I will throw that out as well.

45:17.780 --> 45:19.860
But out in the trash.

45:19.860 --> 45:20.420
What's that?

45:20.420 --> 45:22.100
I think Susan needs me in the bedroom.

45:23.060 --> 45:24.340
Hello, mother.

45:24.340 --> 45:25.460
Are your parents senile?

45:25.460 --> 45:26.740
Because you could pull this off.

45:26.740 --> 45:28.740
You could say, hey, good news.

45:28.740 --> 45:29.460
Everybody showed up.

45:29.460 --> 45:30.580
But they're waiting in the bedroom.

45:30.580 --> 45:31.220
They're very shy.

45:31.220 --> 45:32.660
They don't want to come out all together.

45:32.660 --> 45:38.500
Gaslight your parents and maybe you could do like a Groundhog Day ass thing and keep

45:38.500 --> 45:40.340
waking up in the morning and reset it back to Christmas.

45:40.340 --> 45:41.620
Rate yourself one to ten.

45:41.620 --> 45:43.140
How good are you at puppetry?

45:45.140 --> 45:46.580
And ventriloquism.

45:46.580 --> 45:48.020
Darlene, she's in the kitchen.

45:48.020 --> 45:49.300
I'm doing fine, mom.

45:49.300 --> 45:51.380
I'm making your favorite cookies.

45:51.380 --> 45:53.620
I'm making your favorite sweet potatoes.

45:54.820 --> 45:56.420
Are we talking about a weekend or are we talking about a night?

45:56.420 --> 45:58.900
Because we need to figure this out hour by hour.

45:58.900 --> 46:04.100
Because two games of Ticket to Ride, if they're contentious games, may be an hour and a half

46:04.100 --> 46:04.340
each.

46:04.340 --> 46:06.100
Can you even do Ticket to Ride with three players?

46:06.100 --> 46:07.380
And then you're going to a drinking game.

46:07.380 --> 46:08.340
So that's three hours.

46:08.340 --> 46:09.860
Drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink.

46:09.860 --> 46:11.140
That'll be the last four hours.

46:11.140 --> 46:13.460
So we have seven hours of the day spoken for so far.

46:13.460 --> 46:14.660
That's finished.

46:14.660 --> 46:18.580
We are assuming if you go to bed at eight o'clock, which you're going to have to do

46:18.580 --> 46:21.780
because there's not going to be any stuff and you're going to be super daylight drunk

46:22.420 --> 46:23.220
by eight o'clock.

46:23.220 --> 46:26.340
I would suggest that you guys maybe don't stay at a house.

46:26.340 --> 46:27.620
Like don't be.

46:27.620 --> 46:28.420
Oh, that's good.

46:28.420 --> 46:32.500
I think don't be at the place where you've had big family thanksgivings together.

46:32.500 --> 46:35.060
I think maybe why don't you go to a movie together?

46:35.060 --> 46:36.500
A lot of people go to Christmas Day movies.

46:36.500 --> 46:39.300
I did not realize this until I was working at the paper on Christmas Day once.

46:39.300 --> 46:39.700
What's up?

46:39.700 --> 46:41.620
I also worked at the paper on Christmas Day.

46:41.620 --> 46:43.380
And they said, go to the movies.

46:43.380 --> 46:44.660
There's people there all the time.

46:44.660 --> 46:46.900
And I was like, wow, this sounds like a friggin' hot lead.

46:46.900 --> 46:47.620
I got to get out there.

46:47.620 --> 46:48.180
And you're right.

46:48.180 --> 46:49.940
Bust this story wide open.

46:49.940 --> 46:52.260
So I went and walked up to the line of people.

46:52.260 --> 46:57.540
And apparently, I think they were as surprised as I was that their movie going was newsworthy.

46:57.540 --> 46:59.700
But I did ask each of them like, so what'd you see?

46:59.700 --> 47:04.500
Or you could do something very similar and do what I like to call real holiday TV, which

47:04.500 --> 47:07.860
is you and your family wander around the neighborhood and look into people's houses

47:07.860 --> 47:09.620
and watch them experience Christmas.

47:09.620 --> 47:10.580
See how many people they have.

47:10.580 --> 47:12.580
See if there'd be room for three more.

47:12.580 --> 47:12.820
Yeah.

47:12.820 --> 47:13.780
And then just duck in there.

47:13.780 --> 47:16.100
I couldn't help but notice your table wasn't quite full yet.

47:16.100 --> 47:17.860
Could you seat two, maybe three?

47:17.860 --> 47:20.100
That is a big bowl of dip for just four people.

47:21.220 --> 47:23.140
Looks like it could easily feed seven.

47:23.140 --> 47:24.500
You always have leftovers, you know?

47:24.500 --> 47:27.540
Always have leftovers.

47:27.540 --> 47:28.100
Man.

47:28.100 --> 47:32.500
Can you recreate that scene in Home Alone where he tries to make it look like a rocking

47:32.500 --> 47:35.620
house party is going on to keep the burglars away, but you do that.

47:35.620 --> 47:39.620
And maybe the other people that you're handling are your family members.

47:39.620 --> 47:43.460
And also, right when you finish getting that set up, do like a bunch of mescaline.

47:43.460 --> 47:46.500
And then maybe the illusion will be complete.

47:47.300 --> 47:48.580
You could send them to our house, Jim.

47:49.780 --> 47:50.660
Come on over.

47:50.660 --> 47:51.700
Yeah, leave two parents.

47:51.700 --> 47:53.220
And then they look and go, what do we do?

47:53.220 --> 47:55.140
They can come over, too.

47:55.140 --> 47:55.380
Yeah.

47:57.300 --> 47:59.380
Guys, I'm so happy to be here with you two.

47:59.380 --> 48:00.900
I'm happy to be here, too.

48:00.900 --> 48:02.260
Well, I'm going to leave tomorrow.

48:02.260 --> 48:03.220
You are leaving tomorrow.

48:03.220 --> 48:03.700
That's true.

48:05.300 --> 48:06.740
Candle Knight's question.

48:06.740 --> 48:10.740
I'm 25 and just moved to Wisconsin to start my first full-time job.

48:10.740 --> 48:13.620
Because of this, I won't be able to head home for Christmas this year.

48:13.620 --> 48:15.460
First time I won't be able to make it.

48:15.460 --> 48:18.500
My parents and older sister live in Southern California where I grew up.

48:18.500 --> 48:19.780
SoCal, babe.

48:19.780 --> 48:20.420
Wow, that sucked.

48:20.420 --> 48:21.620
Redondo, what's up?

48:21.620 --> 48:25.780
Well, I'm really sad that I won't be able to spend Christmas with them this year.

48:25.780 --> 48:28.340
I'm heading to a friend's place in Chicago, which is awesome.

48:28.900 --> 48:30.580
But it just won't be the same.

48:30.580 --> 48:33.540
What are some awesome things for me to do this Christmas season to stop being sad that

48:33.540 --> 48:36.180
I won't be able to see my family for the holiday this year?

48:37.220 --> 48:38.100
You could cry a bunch.

48:38.100 --> 48:38.820
You could cry.

48:38.820 --> 48:41.940
Don't talk to your parents because they're just going to make you feel guilty about it.

48:41.940 --> 48:42.980
Well, OK.

48:42.980 --> 48:43.540
You could.

48:43.540 --> 48:45.220
I don't know what your technology setup is.

48:45.220 --> 48:48.100
But you could just FaceTime the whole day and feel like you're there.

48:48.100 --> 48:50.180
Travis, how are you handling not being able to see your family on holiday this year?

48:50.180 --> 48:51.860
Oh, I'm going to have to tell you guys I'm dead.

48:51.860 --> 48:54.980
Like, there's been a nuclear strike here in West Virginia and y'all dead to me.

48:55.780 --> 48:59.380
No, I mean, probably phone calls and drinking.

48:59.380 --> 49:00.660
Yeah, I might scream that one.

49:01.780 --> 49:02.340
Ow.

49:02.340 --> 49:05.780
I'm just saying, like, can Teresa hear us?

49:05.780 --> 49:06.820
I mean, eventually, yes.

49:07.380 --> 49:10.660
We are clearly the way better family to kick it with.

49:10.660 --> 49:11.940
Listen, don't I know?

49:12.660 --> 49:13.380
I would say-

49:13.380 --> 49:13.860
Just kidding.

49:13.860 --> 49:15.940
No, I'm just saying I love my in-laws.

49:15.940 --> 49:16.900
They're really terrific.

49:16.900 --> 49:18.180
I think I've met them once.

49:18.180 --> 49:18.900
Yeah, they're great.

49:18.900 --> 49:20.420
Wait, I mean, here's the thing.

49:20.420 --> 49:25.860
What you got to do is this is your opportunity to make some new holiday traditions for yourself.

49:25.860 --> 49:29.540
So maybe your friends decorate cookies and watch Die Hard.

49:29.540 --> 49:30.660
And that's like your Christmas thing.

49:30.660 --> 49:34.820
What you don't want to do is spend the day trying to recreate traditions that you and

49:34.820 --> 49:35.540
your family did.

49:35.540 --> 49:36.580
Well, it would be worse than that.

49:36.580 --> 49:38.420
Like, you know guys in my house, we don't-

49:38.420 --> 49:38.980
Stop it.

49:38.980 --> 49:40.500
We always watch them up at Christmas, Carol.

49:40.500 --> 49:41.620
And then we sing songs for the neighbors.

49:41.620 --> 49:43.860
The governor's cat is a crazy cat.

49:43.860 --> 49:46.020
What are you doing?

49:46.020 --> 49:50.660
Start your own thing and make it like really based around the fact that you're young and

49:50.660 --> 49:51.860
you could do whatever you want.

49:51.860 --> 49:55.300
So make it like a drinking game set up around Charlie Brown Christmas.

49:55.300 --> 49:56.020
You know what I mean?

49:56.020 --> 49:59.540
Make it a fun thing that you would never feel comfortable doing with your family.

50:00.580 --> 50:07.060
If you don't set bars for yourself as to what connotates Christmas, and that's something

50:07.060 --> 50:11.620
that I think we've had to sort of make our peace with as you get older.

50:11.620 --> 50:19.060
Like, from the time I was born until, God, until I was probably like 21 or 22, we would

50:19.060 --> 50:21.140
sit at the top of the stairs each Christmas morning.

50:21.140 --> 50:24.660
Sometimes my parents would put a string actually across the top of the stairs, the note on

50:24.660 --> 50:27.940
it says, don't go downstairs, even though we all knew the rules pretty well.

50:27.940 --> 50:30.820
And we would, you know, wait for them to say, come on down.

50:30.820 --> 50:32.580
Our parents get a cup of tea or whatever.

50:32.580 --> 50:35.380
And then we would rush downstairs and open our presents.

50:35.380 --> 50:37.380
And like, that was our baseline of Christmas.

50:37.380 --> 50:37.940
And I think that-

50:37.940 --> 50:40.340
Like 22, 19, and like 60.

50:40.340 --> 50:44.580
We thought that was like fully Normie, Norm Macdonald behavior.

50:44.580 --> 50:47.220
And that was our, but that was like what we thought of as Christmas.

50:47.220 --> 50:52.660
And like, the further I get away from that, the happier I am just to like, you know, be

50:52.660 --> 50:56.340
with people that I like and do fun stuff and, you know.

50:56.340 --> 50:59.940
Well, with Justin going to the Smurls too, now it started like, instead of waking up

50:59.940 --> 51:04.180
at like 7 a.m. and tearing into stuff, like we get together at like noon, one o'clock

51:04.180 --> 51:06.660
and, you know, very casually, like go to town.

51:06.660 --> 51:10.820
And it's, you know, that's the thing is traditions are what you make them.

51:10.820 --> 51:13.940
And every year, you know, it's your own setup.

51:13.940 --> 51:18.740
And I think you can stress yourself out and make yourself really sad by saying like, oh,

51:18.740 --> 51:20.180
I can't recreate these things.

51:20.180 --> 51:24.180
But like, maybe this is the year that it's your Christmas.

51:24.180 --> 51:24.420
Yeah.

51:24.420 --> 51:25.060
You know?

51:25.060 --> 51:25.380
Yeah.

51:25.380 --> 51:28.580
Do, when in Rome, follow their suggestions.

51:28.580 --> 51:29.060
Yeah, man.

51:29.060 --> 51:30.180
Chicago's an awesome town.

51:30.180 --> 51:32.420
I bet you could find some awesome Christmas stuff.

51:32.420 --> 51:34.820
Not from November to March it ain't.

51:34.820 --> 51:36.500
Here's a fun thing to do in Chicago.

51:36.500 --> 51:37.780
Try not to die.

51:38.340 --> 51:43.220
Try not to die from either the hailstorm of actual hail or bullets from guns.

51:44.180 --> 51:46.660
Merry Christmas, Chicago.

51:46.660 --> 51:50.500
You were great in the 80s when they made all those movies about you that were all set in

51:50.500 --> 51:56.420
Chicago and then global warming and global gunning happened because of global gunning.

51:56.420 --> 51:57.860
There was that one.

51:57.860 --> 52:03.220
There was that the El Nino came, the El Nino of guns, and then everyone had one.

52:03.220 --> 52:04.500
Merry Christmas, Chicago.

52:04.500 --> 52:05.460
Please stay safe.

52:05.460 --> 52:06.660
Stay indoors.

52:08.260 --> 52:09.700
Griffin, do you have any more Yahoos?

52:09.700 --> 52:13.380
I want to be done because I just want to get back to spending time with our whole family.

52:13.380 --> 52:17.700
And I think we've given people the greatest gift of all, which is 50 minutes of our time.

52:17.700 --> 52:17.940
Yeah.

52:18.740 --> 52:20.900
This one was sent in by Ira Ray.

52:20.900 --> 52:22.500
Are you Ira Ray?

52:22.500 --> 52:23.220
Who wants to know?

52:23.220 --> 52:24.180
I caught you by surprise.

52:24.180 --> 52:25.220
I actually saw you.

52:25.220 --> 52:26.260
Like, I got to get it.

52:26.260 --> 52:27.300
Woof, woof, woof.

52:27.300 --> 52:27.940
Thank you, Ira Ray.

52:27.940 --> 52:29.220
He peed a little when that happened.

52:30.100 --> 52:33.460
This one's by Yahoo Answers user Racy Lady, who asks,

52:33.460 --> 52:40.260
alternative to Kris Kringle, has anyone any ideas on Christmas presents other than personal?

52:40.260 --> 52:44.260
Or Kris Kringle would like to use something new for the family.

52:44.260 --> 52:45.700
From President Obama.

52:46.260 --> 52:47.060
That might be good.

52:47.780 --> 52:51.780
You're talking about different sources from which presents could have come.

52:51.780 --> 52:53.700
Oh, you could do like alternate person.

52:53.700 --> 52:58.260
So like to Travis from evil Travis from other dimension.

52:58.260 --> 53:00.180
You're going to have to build a lot of fiction around that, though.

53:00.180 --> 53:01.940
I think there's got to be an easier solution.

53:01.940 --> 53:05.940
Okay, to Travis from the ghost that watches you while you sleep.

53:06.740 --> 53:10.180
Do you guys know that if you space out while Griffin's reading the question

53:10.180 --> 53:13.860
and then jump back into it, you can turn it into a game.

53:13.860 --> 53:17.060
So like you use context clues to try to walk backwards to the-

53:17.060 --> 53:19.940
Like in Paycheck, where he like has to go back and put the machine together.

53:19.940 --> 53:23.860
Travis, without giving him any more clues, Justin, what do you think the Yahoo answer is about?

53:23.860 --> 53:28.820
Griffin, if you put a pistol in my mouth, I could not tell you.

53:28.820 --> 53:30.260
Well, no, because you'd have a mouthful of pistol.

53:30.260 --> 53:30.980
You'd still have a good pistol.

53:30.980 --> 53:33.700
Look at me in the eyes.

53:33.700 --> 53:34.660
Look at me in the eyes.

53:34.660 --> 53:35.140
Presence.

53:36.020 --> 53:39.940
Different present sources other than yourself or Ho-Ho.

53:40.660 --> 53:41.380
What can they be?

53:41.940 --> 53:45.140
For friends, family, children, neighbors, policemen.

53:45.940 --> 53:46.820
You're saying like-

53:47.780 --> 53:49.780
You're going to write something on that from tag.

53:49.780 --> 53:50.500
Okay.

53:50.500 --> 53:51.300
What are you going to write?

53:51.300 --> 53:53.540
Not yourself, not Santa, not Chris Kringle.

53:53.540 --> 53:54.900
Why can't I write those?

53:54.900 --> 53:57.140
Because they're looking for fun, extra sources.

53:57.140 --> 53:58.180
Justin, it's Yahoo answers.

53:58.180 --> 53:59.700
Why does anyone do anything for anything?

53:59.700 --> 54:04.420
What you're setting up is this weird contest where it's like,

54:04.420 --> 54:05.460
what did Santa get you?

54:05.460 --> 54:07.060
And what did SpongeBob give you?

54:07.060 --> 54:10.020
And it's like next year, it's like, do you want to go sit on Santa's lap?

54:10.020 --> 54:10.660
No.

54:10.660 --> 54:12.340
Santa gave me a stupid sweater.

54:12.340 --> 54:14.020
SpongeBob gave me a tasty baked oven.

54:14.020 --> 54:14.900
I'm losing my mind over here.

54:14.900 --> 54:16.500
What about the spirit of generosity?

54:16.500 --> 54:17.460
Could you put that on there?

54:17.460 --> 54:19.540
How about you give them an empty box.

54:19.540 --> 54:21.220
So when they open it up, there's nothing in there.

54:21.220 --> 54:24.900
You say, we donated your presents to poor kids.

54:24.900 --> 54:26.660
And this is from life lessons.

54:26.660 --> 54:29.940
If you want to antagonize your child towards somebody else

54:29.940 --> 54:33.300
for some arbitrary reason, like you get them a box

54:33.300 --> 54:36.900
and they open the box and it's full of broken glass.

54:36.900 --> 54:38.180
And then the kid's like, what?

54:38.180 --> 54:39.620
Let me check that from tag.

54:39.620 --> 54:41.700
It's from former MTV VJ Sway.

54:43.140 --> 54:44.020
Man, I hate this.

54:44.020 --> 54:44.980
I'm only eight years old.

54:44.980 --> 54:47.220
I've never seen Sway and I don't know Sway from Joe.

54:47.220 --> 54:48.820
But man, I hate this guy.

54:48.820 --> 54:50.660
They open the box and there's just a head in there.

54:50.660 --> 54:51.700
It's from Kevin Spacey.

54:51.700 --> 54:52.740
It's from Kevin Spacey.

54:52.740 --> 54:54.100
Oh, see, but that was a goof.

54:54.980 --> 54:55.540
What?

54:55.540 --> 54:58.340
No, Kevin Spacey's a serial killer in real life.

54:58.340 --> 54:59.700
That movie's based on him.

54:59.700 --> 55:01.860
I'm saying maybe your parents want you to hate Sway.

55:01.860 --> 55:03.380
Maybe they have some sort of beef.

55:03.940 --> 55:05.780
Maybe they liked who's another VJ.

55:05.780 --> 55:08.740
You're saying they had a child so they could find someone

55:08.740 --> 55:10.420
to take the fall for killing Sway.

55:10.420 --> 55:10.820
Or-

55:10.820 --> 55:12.980
And then someday buy an ad on a podcast

55:12.980 --> 55:15.380
that activates that child to kill Sway.

55:16.180 --> 55:17.700
Happy Christmas, everyone.

55:17.700 --> 55:18.900
We killed Sway.

55:18.900 --> 55:20.340
We finally took him out.

55:20.340 --> 55:22.820
He was number two on the list right after Osama.

55:22.820 --> 55:25.940
You know what's sad is Sway thought this would be the episode

55:25.940 --> 55:26.980
he played for his family.

55:28.420 --> 55:29.140
I'm sorry.

55:29.140 --> 55:30.820
I don't know what these guys are talking about.

55:30.820 --> 55:31.460
I don't know what happened here.

55:31.460 --> 55:33.860
We found him in a cave underneath Carson Daly.

55:33.860 --> 55:36.740
Here's the weirdest part when Griffin could pick any random celebrity.

55:36.740 --> 55:40.260
Sway is like one of the 0.05% of celebrities

55:40.260 --> 55:42.020
that Griffin actually has had some interaction with

55:42.020 --> 55:42.900
and kind of likes.

55:42.900 --> 55:43.460
That's what I'm saying.

55:43.460 --> 55:44.020
As weird as I can say.

55:44.980 --> 55:47.780
I have communed with Sway.

55:47.780 --> 55:48.980
Sway and I have lunched-

55:48.980 --> 55:51.380
Well, we all commune with Sway every day, Griffin,

55:51.380 --> 55:52.500
when we look inside ourselves.

55:52.500 --> 55:54.820
When I kneel towards Sway's house.

55:54.820 --> 56:03.300
Sway planted the seed in the fertile loins of my journalistic endeavors

56:03.860 --> 56:05.300
and my career at large.

56:05.300 --> 56:07.060
He is a lovely human being.

56:07.060 --> 56:11.540
There's nobody on earth that hates Sway except for these two people.

56:11.540 --> 56:13.140
That's how they found each other.

56:13.140 --> 56:14.900
They were having a really hard time.

56:14.900 --> 56:17.860
They met on the message board of which they were both moderators.

56:18.900 --> 56:20.580
They were having a hard time living in a world

56:20.580 --> 56:22.660
where there were only two people that hated Sway,

56:22.660 --> 56:25.060
so they had to give birth to this third person

56:25.060 --> 56:26.500
that wasn't so crazy about their customs.

56:26.500 --> 56:27.620
That's how religions begin.

56:27.620 --> 56:31.220
And that's the story of how Mr. Kurt Loader met his wife.

56:31.940 --> 56:32.820
Mrs. Kurt Loader.

56:32.820 --> 56:33.780
Mrs. Kurt Loader.

56:35.060 --> 56:39.220

I want to thank John Roderick in the long winters

57:31.940 --> 57:32.900
for the use of our theme song.

57:32.900 --> 57:35.860
It's a departure, which is you can find it on the album

57:35.860 --> 57:36.740
Putting the Days to Bed.

57:36.740 --> 57:39.140
I believe it is track 10, if I'm not mistaken.

57:39.140 --> 57:42.980
I believe it is track 10 on that LP, that long play album.

57:42.980 --> 57:46.100
I also want to give a shout out to all of our listeners

57:46.100 --> 57:47.940

57:47.940 --> 57:51.220
And I'm sorry about the 26th when you get flooded with gifts

57:51.220 --> 57:53.460
that people returned because they did not like them.

57:53.460 --> 57:55.540
It is the saddest day of the year.

57:55.540 --> 57:55.940
Yeah.

57:55.940 --> 57:57.140
Boxing day, they call it.

57:58.580 --> 58:01.140
People punch each other in the box to try and,

58:01.140 --> 58:02.820
oh, the Macy's is going to run out of money.

58:02.820 --> 58:03.940
I got to get in the front of that line.

58:03.940 --> 58:04.820
Punch, punch, punch, punch, punch.

58:06.340 --> 58:07.940
And that's going to do it for us.

58:07.940 --> 58:08.740
I think I'd like-

58:09.300 --> 58:09.700
What?

58:09.700 --> 58:11.620
I feel like we should have like a warmer send off.

58:11.620 --> 58:13.060
Well, I was thinking we should do,

58:13.620 --> 58:16.260
I'll get my guitar and we can do a song.

58:16.260 --> 58:17.140
That sounds terrible.

58:17.140 --> 58:19.940
Can we just say like, happy holidays and we love you all

58:19.940 --> 58:21.220
and we can't wait to see you in 2014.

58:21.220 --> 58:24.420
And stick around after the outro music

58:24.420 --> 58:25.460
and maybe there'll be a song.

58:25.460 --> 58:26.660
I'm going to try to talk them into it.

58:26.660 --> 58:27.300
Don't, don't, don't, don't.

58:27.300 --> 58:28.100
Just listen through.

58:28.100 --> 58:30.420
We love you and thank you for listening to us.

58:30.420 --> 58:32.820
I don't know if we're going to do another episode in 2014.

58:32.820 --> 58:34.500
If we do, it's a surprise.

58:34.500 --> 58:35.300
If not, we'll see you in 2014.

58:35.300 --> 58:38.180
I don't want it to be like the end of Thor 2,

58:38.180 --> 58:39.540
when people stuck around for the end of Thor 2,

58:39.540 --> 58:41.460
like can't wait to see what secret Marvel secrets.

58:41.460 --> 58:44.020
And it's like, I'm Benicio del Toro in a spaceship

58:44.020 --> 58:45.940
and you have no idea what I'm talking about.

58:45.940 --> 58:46.820
Spoiler.

58:46.820 --> 58:48.100
Thanks for hanging around.

58:49.060 --> 58:49.380
Thanks.

58:49.380 --> 58:50.660
Thank you for hanging around.

58:51.460 --> 58:52.020
We got one final question.

58:52.020 --> 58:55.060
We will have Benicio del Toro singing the Christmas classics

58:55.060 --> 58:55.860
after the credits.

58:55.860 --> 58:56.900
If you want to stick around.

58:57.460 --> 58:58.900
Big props to the best boy, Key Grip.

58:58.900 --> 59:00.420
You definitely want to shout out him.

59:00.420 --> 59:01.540
You definitely want to see him.

59:02.100 --> 59:04.660
This final Yahoo was sent in by Ian Steed.

59:04.660 --> 59:05.700
Thank you, Ian.

59:05.700 --> 59:08.340

59:08.340 --> 59:09.940
Oh, I get it.

59:11.060 --> 59:14.420
Who asks, if Pat, oh.

59:14.420 --> 59:18.740
Oh, if Batman parents are died, then how was he born?

59:20.420 --> 59:21.460
I'm Justin McRoy.

59:21.460 --> 59:22.660
I'm Travis McRoy.

59:22.660 --> 59:23.460
I'm Griffin McRoy.

59:23.460 --> 59:24.660
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

59:24.660 --> 59:25.540
Kiss your dad.

59:25.540 --> 59:26.420
Square on the lips.

59:26.420 --> 59:27.380
Happy candle nights.

59:28.500 --> 59:29.780
Stay tuned for that song.

59:29.780 --> 59:30.260
Don't.

59:30.260 --> 59:47.700
It's not maximum fun.org.

59:47.700 --> 59:50.900
Comedy and culture artist owned listener supported.

59:50.900 --> 01:00:01.140
I really can't stay.

01:00:01.140 --> 01:00:03.300
Baby, it's cold outside.

01:00:03.300 --> 01:00:05.140
I got to go away.

01:00:05.140 --> 01:00:07.380
Baby, it's cold outside.

01:00:07.380 --> 01:00:08.740
This evening has been.

01:00:08.740 --> 01:00:10.340
Been hoping that you'd come back.

01:00:10.340 --> 01:00:12.100
So very nice.

01:00:12.100 --> 01:00:15.460
I'll hold your hands there just like nice.

01:00:15.460 --> 01:00:17.700
My mother will start to worry.

01:00:17.700 --> 01:00:19.460
Beautiful, what's your hurry?

01:00:19.460 --> 01:00:21.700
My father will be pacing the floor.

01:00:21.700 --> 01:00:23.540
Listen to the fireplace roar.

01:00:23.540 --> 01:00:25.700
Really, I better scurry.

01:00:25.700 --> 01:00:27.620
Beautiful, all these don't hurt.

01:00:27.620 --> 01:00:29.700
Maybe just to have a drink more.

01:00:29.700 --> 01:00:31.700
This is really terrible.

01:00:31.700 --> 01:00:33.220
The neighbors might think.

01:00:33.220 --> 01:00:35.220
Maybe it's cold out there.

01:00:35.220 --> 01:00:37.060
Say, what's in this drink?

01:00:37.060 --> 01:00:39.540
No caps to be had out there.

01:00:39.540 --> 01:00:41.220
I wish I knew how.

01:00:41.220 --> 01:00:42.500
Your eyes are like starlings.

01:00:42.500 --> 01:00:44.500
To break this spell.

01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:46.420
I'll take your hat.

01:00:46.420 --> 01:00:47.700
Your hair looks so.

01:00:47.700 --> 01:00:50.260
I ought to say no, no, no, sir.

01:00:50.260 --> 01:00:51.780
Mind if I move in closer?

01:00:51.780 --> 01:00:53.940
At least I'm going to say that I tried.

01:00:53.940 --> 01:00:55.780
What's the sense in hurting my pride?

01:00:55.780 --> 01:00:57.540
I really can't stay.

01:00:57.540 --> 01:00:58.980
Baby, it's cold outside.

01:00:58.980 --> 01:01:07.060
Cold, but it's cold outside.

01:01:07.060 --> 01:01:12.900
Baby, it's cold outside.

01:01:12.900 --> 01:01:15.460
Cold.

01:01:15.460 --> 01:01:16.260
Boo.

01:01:16.260 --> 01:01:18.100
Boo earns.
