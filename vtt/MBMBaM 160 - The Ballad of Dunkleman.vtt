00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:31.840
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:31.840 --> 00:47.920
Welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me, an advice show for the modern era. I'm your

00:47.920 --> 00:51.120
oldest brother Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother Travis McElroy.

00:51.120 --> 01:07.280
It's how I commune with my dolphin brethren. I'm Griffin McElroy and a baby brother.

01:09.440 --> 01:11.760
Why are you communing with dolphins?

01:11.760 --> 01:22.720
You know how there's a type of people in the world who have a chance encounter with a dolphin

01:22.720 --> 01:26.560
and then that's like their whole lives? Usually they're an art teacher.

01:30.320 --> 01:34.480
I did not know until I had a chance encounter with the dolphin that I'm one of those people

01:34.480 --> 01:37.680
and now I'm all about that endless ring of light, you know?

01:39.680 --> 01:40.880
Is that what a blowhole is?

01:40.880 --> 01:45.680
I guess it's a novel. Maybe you should go to a library.

01:45.680 --> 01:49.200
I think in that case a dolphin, doesn't he swim through endless rings of light?

01:49.200 --> 01:55.520
There are light rings. Guys, dolphins, I don't know. They're just big, slippery,

01:55.520 --> 02:02.880
perfectly designed piles of muscle just designed in sinew and they're so glorious

02:02.880 --> 02:06.480
and I got to touch one and kiss one when I was in Mexico.

02:06.480 --> 02:14.080
So weigh for me the majesty of a dolphin versus like a beautiful horse.

02:15.200 --> 02:20.880
Fuck. I think we've said before that dolphins are just the horses of the sea,

02:20.880 --> 02:24.160
despite the fact that there are things already called sea horses out there.

02:25.040 --> 02:27.120
You think they would get the title but no.

02:27.120 --> 02:29.440
Griffin, may I ask you an impertinent question?

02:31.040 --> 02:32.720
How good a kisser was the dolphin?

02:32.720 --> 02:36.160
Really great. This is a fun story.

02:36.160 --> 02:39.760
My, the trainer who was like leading me on,

02:39.760 --> 02:43.680
it was called Dolphin Discovery and it was the most inexpensive of the dolphin packages.

02:45.600 --> 02:48.320
Welcome to Dave's Discount Dolphins.

02:48.320 --> 02:49.200
It was so fucked up.

02:49.200 --> 02:52.720
Half of them are manatees. We don't pay that guy's attention.

02:52.720 --> 02:55.040
The travel agent that booked this excursion for us,

02:55.040 --> 02:59.200
because when you stay at all inclusive resorts, you have excursions

02:59.200 --> 03:07.440
because you have to find reasons to get away from the comfort of it all, the paralytic comfort.

03:07.440 --> 03:09.280
And he was like, there's three packages.

03:09.280 --> 03:13.600
There's Discovery, and then there was like two others more expensive

03:13.600 --> 03:16.080
called like Extreme Zone and the Royal.

03:16.960 --> 03:19.600
Extreme Zone. I don't like the sound of that. That sounds like-

03:19.600 --> 03:22.560
It was so fucked up because in those more expensive ones,

03:22.560 --> 03:26.640
he basically said like in Mexico, they let you do more stuff with the dolphin.

03:27.440 --> 03:28.880
You get to like third base.

03:28.880 --> 03:31.600
He said, you can do more stuff with the dolphins because they have,

03:32.320 --> 03:34.160
quote unquote, because they have tequila.

03:34.160 --> 03:37.200
And when he said that, the world became a little bit less of a special place for me.

03:39.920 --> 03:43.120
But I kissed the dolphin and the trainer, as I was like going up,

03:43.120 --> 03:46.640
like ready to just fucking lay one on, his name was Pacal.

03:47.280 --> 03:50.000
As I was getting ready to lay one on him, she goes,

03:50.000 --> 03:52.480
Griffin, have you ever kissed a boy before?

03:52.480 --> 03:55.680
And I was like, hey, why did you just put me on blast

03:55.680 --> 04:01.040
in front of my fiance in this like huge family?

04:01.040 --> 04:03.680
Griffin, have you had a gay experience before?

04:04.560 --> 04:05.840
Let's all talk about it.

04:05.840 --> 04:06.800
Let's talk about it.

04:06.800 --> 04:08.320
And then I had to like stand there and be like,

04:09.280 --> 04:11.440
I hesitated for a few seconds, like thinking like,

04:11.440 --> 04:13.120
have I ever kissed a dude before?

04:16.160 --> 04:18.320
I lied. I said no.

04:18.320 --> 04:20.320
I didn't want Pacal to feel less special.

04:20.320 --> 04:24.320
Did, if you tried to pull something with the dolphin,

04:24.320 --> 04:27.120
would it, would they try to charge you more?

04:27.120 --> 04:30.000
Like, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, you didn't get the Royal package.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.200
No touching.

04:31.200 --> 04:34.160
Well, no, I mean, I'm not talking, they don't let you fuck the dolphin.

04:34.160 --> 04:36.160
I'm not talking about dolphin prostitution,

04:36.160 --> 04:39.200
but they do place your little like safety tank

04:39.200 --> 04:42.480
right next to their extreme zone tank where no shit,

04:42.480 --> 04:45.040
they would have you lay on your belly in the water.

04:45.040 --> 04:47.920
And then two dolphins would come up and press and swim

04:47.920 --> 04:50.400
against each of your feet, propelling you into the air.

04:50.400 --> 04:52.960
And I was like, fuck, that was like 30 extra bucks.

04:52.960 --> 04:54.240
It would have been totally worth it.

04:54.240 --> 04:56.400
I got to just kiss him.

04:56.400 --> 05:00.800
How much do you have to pay to kill them with your bare hands?

05:00.800 --> 05:02.480
If you want to kill one dolphin.

05:02.480 --> 05:04.080
That's the double Royal package.

05:04.080 --> 05:05.520
And then there's the triple Royal,

05:05.520 --> 05:08.160
which is where you kill a dolphin while another dolphin watches.

05:08.160 --> 05:11.280
How much do you have to pay for the dolphin to end your life

05:11.280 --> 05:12.320
because you're suffering?

05:14.640 --> 05:16.560
How much for a dolphin Asia, Griffin?

05:16.560 --> 05:18.000
That's what I'm asking you right now.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.400
I just need a dolphin angel of mercy.

05:20.400 --> 05:22.400
I don't think you can get that through the travel agent.

05:22.400 --> 05:23.680
I think you have to book that on the side.

05:23.680 --> 05:24.880
And I think you can really only get it

05:24.880 --> 05:26.960
after you've established a certain level of trust

05:26.960 --> 05:28.480
with the dolphin and its trainer.

05:28.480 --> 05:30.880
If you're just some random gringo who's strolled down

05:30.880 --> 05:33.200
for the weekend, they're not going to let a dolphin kill you.

05:33.200 --> 05:33.760
Right.

05:33.760 --> 05:34.640
They don't know what you have.

05:35.360 --> 05:36.240
Can we not say kill?

05:36.240 --> 05:38.880
Can we say release from this mortal burden?

05:38.880 --> 05:39.040
Yeah.

05:39.040 --> 05:41.600
And if a dolphin kills you consensually,

05:42.160 --> 05:45.120
then your spirit is released into the dolphin,

05:45.120 --> 05:46.320
the dolphin lifestream.

05:46.320 --> 05:48.320
That's actually the only way new dolphins are made.

05:48.320 --> 05:51.040
It's a really weird life cycle for dolphins.

05:51.040 --> 05:53.120
How do you, how much do you have to pay?

05:53.120 --> 05:55.920
It's kind of, it's basically like the Highlander.

05:57.520 --> 06:01.600
How much do you have to pay to kill a dolphin

06:01.600 --> 06:04.560
as it kills you and you get to ride it into heaven?

06:07.120 --> 06:09.360
How jealous will everyone in heaven be?

06:10.080 --> 06:11.280
I'm St. Peter.

06:11.280 --> 06:12.640
I've been up here forever.

06:12.640 --> 06:13.520
I've seen it all.

06:13.520 --> 06:15.760
Whoa, holy shit.

06:15.760 --> 06:17.520
That dolphin's wearing sunglasses.

06:17.520 --> 06:17.680
Yeah.

06:17.680 --> 06:20.160
I put them on him while we were in the stratosphere.

06:20.160 --> 06:24.560
I put some sunglasses too so he could go to heaven.

06:24.560 --> 06:28.160
And I killed these sweet, these sweet Tommy Bahama jams

06:28.160 --> 06:31.360
so they could go with me up to heaven too.

06:31.360 --> 06:36.080
And I killed a case of Corona so I could bring that also.

06:37.360 --> 06:39.360
As you've almost certainly guessed by this point,

06:39.360 --> 06:41.760
this is an advice show for the modern era.

06:42.560 --> 06:44.720
Let's get into it and let's help some folks out.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
I'm 18 and I want to get a tattoo.

06:48.640 --> 06:49.840
Problem is my parents.

06:49.840 --> 06:50.960
Don't want me to get one.

06:51.520 --> 06:53.360
Normally this wouldn't be a big issue for me,

06:53.360 --> 06:56.480
but I don't know if my wanting a tattoo comes from the fact

06:56.480 --> 06:59.920
that I actually want one or because I just want to do

06:59.920 --> 07:01.440
something to rebel against my parents.

07:02.240 --> 07:05.840
What can I do to sort out my confusion?

07:05.840 --> 07:06.640
That's from thanks.

07:07.520 --> 07:10.240
That's from a tattoo snafu in Toronto.

07:11.600 --> 07:14.080
That's so rare for people to realize that they're,

07:15.360 --> 07:16.320
that they're rebelling,

07:16.320 --> 07:19.120
that they're doing something other than-

07:19.120 --> 07:20.800
It's a remarkable amount of insight.

07:20.800 --> 07:22.080
Well, they call me crazy,

07:22.080 --> 07:24.800
but I almost feel like because you're having the insight,

07:24.800 --> 07:26.480
it means that you're not just doing it

07:26.480 --> 07:28.080
because your parents want to do it.

07:28.080 --> 07:29.200
But it don't want you to do it

07:29.200 --> 07:31.040
because it's like if you think about it and you say,

07:31.040 --> 07:32.400
wait, am I just doing this

07:32.400 --> 07:34.320
because my parents don't want me to do it?

07:34.320 --> 07:37.040
And like by recognizing that that might be a factor

07:37.040 --> 07:38.720
and then still wanting to do it,

07:39.520 --> 07:41.280
it almost seems to cancel it out.

07:41.280 --> 07:43.440
Chav, you have more tattoos than Justin and I put together.

07:43.440 --> 07:45.280
How many of them were done out of rebelliousness?

07:45.280 --> 07:50.000
Um, only one, but it was a rebelling against myself.

07:50.000 --> 07:50.800
Yeah.

07:50.800 --> 07:51.680
I showed me.

07:51.680 --> 07:52.480
Yeah.

07:52.480 --> 07:56.000
You really, you really lost your religion with that.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.080
Is it, which one, which one are we talking about?

07:58.080 --> 07:59.520
It's the long nest monster.

07:59.520 --> 08:00.080
Yeah.

08:00.080 --> 08:02.240
That one was just a big fuck you to myself.

08:02.240 --> 08:02.880
I feel like-

08:02.880 --> 08:04.320
That one's on you forever.

08:04.960 --> 08:05.680
Yeah. No, I know.

08:05.680 --> 08:06.720
I'm really feeling it.

08:06.720 --> 08:08.720
You know, it was a huge punishment for something.

08:09.280 --> 08:11.840
Did you, do we talk about how you're going to Scotland

08:12.560 --> 08:15.040
and how you're going to be in the UK?

08:15.040 --> 08:17.360
And how I'm going to fucking ride the Nessie Hunter boat?

08:17.360 --> 08:18.880
And do the sonar and shit?

08:18.880 --> 08:20.320
No, I think Justin's saying how you're

08:20.320 --> 08:22.800
assumedly going to remove your shirt at some point.

08:22.800 --> 08:24.560
And someone's going to look at you and say,

08:24.560 --> 08:25.520
in a Scottish accent,

08:25.520 --> 08:27.440
I'm not going to try to do this fucking guy.

08:28.080 --> 08:30.800
Well, that is why I don't plan on undressing in Scotland.

08:31.840 --> 08:32.560
Ever.

08:32.560 --> 08:32.800
Yes.

08:35.760 --> 08:39.280
I think the tattoos are pretty personal.

08:39.280 --> 08:41.520
The only reason you should want to get one

08:41.520 --> 08:45.280
is if you really, really, really want to get one.

08:45.280 --> 08:48.240
I mean, really, really, because they are going to be there.

08:48.880 --> 08:50.480
And I'm going to say an obvious thing,

08:51.520 --> 08:53.040
but it still needs to be stated.

08:53.040 --> 08:54.240
When you get a tattoo,

08:54.240 --> 08:56.320
not only is it always going to be there,

08:56.320 --> 09:00.640
it is going to say something about you all the time.

09:00.640 --> 09:03.440
You know, like I have a pineapple tattoo on my wrist

09:03.440 --> 09:05.520
and like every time somebody sees it,

09:05.520 --> 09:07.760
they instantly go, oh, a pineapple.

09:08.800 --> 09:10.080
And it's like, oh yeah.

09:10.080 --> 09:12.880
No, now I have to like engage with you on this

09:12.880 --> 09:15.440
and tell you all about the tattoo on my wrist.

09:15.440 --> 09:20.400
It's like, basically, it's like getting advertisement

09:20.400 --> 09:22.880
on your body that says like, hey, ask me about this.

09:22.880 --> 09:25.360
Yeah, and if you're going to do that,

09:26.160 --> 09:28.720
then you may as well get actual advertised.

09:28.720 --> 09:31.760
See if you can commoditize yourself

09:31.760 --> 09:36.160
and for like maybe like right over your left breast

09:36.160 --> 09:37.760
for like MGD 64.

09:37.760 --> 09:39.760
Sure.

09:39.760 --> 09:41.680
Something where you're going to get payment out of it.

09:42.560 --> 09:43.600
Or free lunches.

09:43.600 --> 09:46.160
Sometimes like restaurants will have like,

09:46.160 --> 09:47.600
you can eat free lunch here forever

09:47.600 --> 09:50.000
if you get our logo tattooed on your face.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.880
It says Pennzoil across your butt cheeks.

09:52.880 --> 09:55.520
And man, it makes it look like your butthole is the O.

09:55.520 --> 09:57.760
Oh, free meal changes for life, I guess.

09:57.760 --> 09:59.280
Or maybe you could get a tattoo

09:59.280 --> 10:01.840
that looks like a birthmark that signifies you

10:01.840 --> 10:05.280
as the last in the line of some kind of royal family line.

10:05.280 --> 10:07.520
And then you could become like the King of Denmark.

10:07.520 --> 10:09.280
You're asking for the King Ralph now.

10:09.280 --> 10:09.780
Yes.

10:10.960 --> 10:14.000
I think it's actually kind of weird how little,

10:14.000 --> 10:17.760
how infrequently I think about the fact that I have a tattoo.

10:17.760 --> 10:20.880
I have a fairly prominent tattoo on my left arm.

10:20.880 --> 10:24.240
And unless I like really think about it,

10:24.240 --> 10:26.240
when I actually notice and remember it's there,

10:27.040 --> 10:28.560
it's actually kind of weird

10:28.560 --> 10:31.440
because I have forgotten about it to that extent.

10:31.440 --> 10:33.920
Like that's how little consideration I give it day to day.

10:33.920 --> 10:36.640
And the one in the back of my leg, forget about it.

10:36.640 --> 10:38.560
Oh, I got the one on my shoulder blade.

10:38.560 --> 10:41.040
And every time I see it, it's like an out of body experience

10:41.040 --> 10:42.880
where I'm like, whose shoulder is that?

10:42.880 --> 10:43.840
Who did that?

10:43.840 --> 10:45.760
I think there's a ratio between,

10:45.760 --> 10:47.680
I think everybody forgets about their tattoos.

10:47.680 --> 10:48.800
So the more like shocking,

10:48.800 --> 10:51.120
if you did get Pennzoil butthole tattoo,

10:52.080 --> 10:54.320
I think that the disconnects between like,

10:54.320 --> 10:55.840
you're never thinking about it

10:55.840 --> 10:57.360
and the first time somebody seeing it

10:57.360 --> 10:59.680
would be like world shattering.

10:59.680 --> 11:01.760
Like somebody's like, it says Pennzoil on your butthole.

11:01.760 --> 11:03.360
And you're like, oh, that's real.

11:03.360 --> 11:04.320
Oh, that's right.

11:04.320 --> 11:08.240
No, how could this be?

11:08.240 --> 11:12.080
Oh God, it's like, it's like Clean Slate,

11:12.800 --> 11:15.040
the movie Clean Slate or maybe Memento.

11:15.600 --> 11:16.800
That's basically the same thing.

11:17.600 --> 11:18.640
Basically the same movie.

11:19.360 --> 11:21.040
So I hope that helps.

11:21.040 --> 11:24.240
Use one of those old yourself apps that you can download

11:24.240 --> 11:25.600
and it lets you take a picture of yourself

11:26.240 --> 11:27.760
and it turns like your face old.

11:27.760 --> 11:29.840
Do you know the apps I'm speaking of?

11:29.840 --> 11:31.840
I don't think they're gonna get the Mike Tyson

11:31.840 --> 11:32.720
their first time out.

11:32.720 --> 11:34.960
I think they'll probably get like a discreet ankle tattoo.

11:34.960 --> 11:36.400
No, you gotta take a picture of your butt

11:36.400 --> 11:39.120
and then age it and picture a Pennzoil tattoo on there.

11:39.120 --> 11:41.040
Right, you can actually, Travis is right.

11:41.040 --> 11:42.560
You can use other parts of your body

11:42.560 --> 11:43.760
on those old yourself apps.

11:43.760 --> 11:44.640
They don't tell you that.

11:45.200 --> 11:48.000
My friend Justin Minsker did it on his torso

11:48.000 --> 11:49.920
and it made his nipples look like eyes

11:49.920 --> 11:52.000
and his belly button look like a mouth.

11:52.000 --> 11:52.880
It was real funny.

11:54.480 --> 11:56.560
Okay, so we hope that helps.

11:56.560 --> 11:58.480
I'm just saying you can have fun with apps.

12:00.560 --> 12:01.920
You don't have to use apps.

12:01.920 --> 12:03.040
You don't have to use apps in the way

12:03.040 --> 12:04.320
that they tell you to use apps.

12:04.320 --> 12:04.960
You can have fun.

12:04.960 --> 12:06.640
Why is there not just for business?

12:06.640 --> 12:08.400
You can have fucking fun with them, right?

12:08.400 --> 12:10.320
Why is no one talking about apps?

12:10.320 --> 12:11.600
They're out there, they're fun.

12:11.600 --> 12:12.320
You can have some.

12:12.960 --> 12:14.400
They should say there's an app for that,

12:14.400 --> 12:16.000
but something else too.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
It should be, you know, with all the shit

12:18.000 --> 12:19.840
that's going on in the news these days,

12:19.840 --> 12:21.280
how about a little bit app news?

12:21.280 --> 12:21.920
You know what I mean?

12:21.920 --> 12:24.560
Just something like, hey, there's Star Wars Angry Birds.

12:24.560 --> 12:25.760
I'm like, oh, thank you.

12:26.320 --> 12:28.240
Thanks, that's CNN.

12:28.240 --> 12:28.960
How about this guys?

12:28.960 --> 12:32.560
How about you could call it what's happening with apps?

12:33.760 --> 12:35.440
Why not just call it what's happening?

12:35.440 --> 12:35.940
Fuck.

12:38.320 --> 12:39.520
Griffin, do you want to do Yahoo

12:39.520 --> 12:40.480
or you want to answer another question?

12:40.480 --> 12:42.240
I feel like we didn't help that last person too much.

12:42.960 --> 12:44.240
As opposed to normal.

12:44.240 --> 12:46.160
Yeah, you mean all people ever.

12:46.160 --> 12:47.680
This Yahoo was sent in by Ira Ray.

12:48.640 --> 12:50.400
Are you Ira Ray?

12:50.400 --> 12:51.600
Who wants to know?

12:51.600 --> 12:52.240
Thank you, Ira Ray.

12:52.240 --> 12:54.320
It's by Yahoo Answers User Question Mark who asks,

12:54.320 --> 12:59.760
what's the most pain-free way to become blood brothers

12:59.760 --> 13:01.680
with my roommate and best friend, Adam?

13:03.200 --> 13:05.040
Me and my roommate want to become blood brothers,

13:05.040 --> 13:06.640
but neither of us want to cut ourselves.

13:07.200 --> 13:10.160
What would be the most pain-free way for us to cut ourselves?

13:10.160 --> 13:11.520
Where would it hurt the least?

13:11.520 --> 13:13.360
Should we be afraid of bleeding to death?

13:14.800 --> 13:16.000
That's for question mark.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.800
Wait for your period.

13:18.800 --> 13:21.440
I don't think his best friend Adam is going to get there.

13:21.440 --> 13:25.920
It feels that way sometimes when you're growing up.

13:25.920 --> 13:27.920
All the other people are getting them and you think,

13:27.920 --> 13:29.520
I'm never going to get mine.

13:29.520 --> 13:31.920
And then the visitor comes.

13:31.920 --> 13:33.920
Can we have a brief menstrual aside?

13:36.720 --> 13:38.160
Quick menstrual sidebar.

13:39.440 --> 13:41.120
I fucked up so bad this week.

13:41.120 --> 13:45.040
I was in a meeting with some of the reporters on the site

13:45.040 --> 13:50.080
and one of them told me that their brother had adopted a dog

13:50.080 --> 13:55.280
a female dog and that he quickly discovered

13:55.280 --> 13:59.920
that the dog was having its period and this horrified me

13:59.920 --> 14:01.600
because I had never thought of dogs

14:01.600 --> 14:03.280
as being something that could do that.

14:05.840 --> 14:09.120
I thought it was entirely a human invention

14:09.120 --> 14:12.000
because I'm six and I don't think my dad

14:12.000 --> 14:13.120
ever had to talk with me.

14:13.120 --> 14:15.760
It's not about dog, I'm sorry.

14:15.760 --> 14:20.720
I do not think the the scope of the talk quote unquote

14:21.600 --> 14:23.520
extends to dog periods.

14:23.520 --> 14:27.200
I think there are super responsible parents out there

14:27.760 --> 14:33.440
who say now ladies for for several days

14:33.440 --> 14:36.160
out of each lunar cycle have periods

14:36.160 --> 14:40.800
and not just human ladies but dogs fucking cats,

14:40.800 --> 14:42.240
dolphins, snails.

14:42.240 --> 14:44.240
I think if you're a dad though or a mom

14:44.240 --> 14:46.480
you're gonna find that your knowledge

14:46.480 --> 14:48.720
of how far down that path it goes

14:49.360 --> 14:50.800
is gonna dry out pretty quickly

14:50.800 --> 14:52.240
because your kid's next question

14:52.240 --> 14:53.920
obviously is gonna be what about bees

14:54.480 --> 14:55.440
and then you're gonna have to look at him

14:55.440 --> 14:56.400
dead in the eye and say I don't know

14:56.400 --> 14:58.240
if bees get periods, I don't know.

14:59.120 --> 15:00.400
Okay are you happy?

15:00.400 --> 15:02.400
Let me break out the encyclopedia

15:02.400 --> 15:04.160
Britannical Periods edition.

15:05.680 --> 15:08.160
Or you can just ask Jeeves and horrify him.

15:08.800 --> 15:10.160
Jeeves what gets periods?

15:10.160 --> 15:15.120
Jeeves is like how long do you have?

15:17.760 --> 15:19.440
Sit down, get comfy.

15:19.440 --> 15:22.000
Get comfortable, crack open a beer.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.200
It's gonna get weird in here.

15:23.200 --> 15:25.360
Here's a cup of hot cocoa I made you

15:25.360 --> 15:27.600
because I am for some reason also a butler.

15:27.600 --> 15:30.240
Crack a window already, it's gonna get live.

15:30.240 --> 15:31.600
Does it cast a shadow?

15:32.640 --> 15:33.120
If so.

15:35.360 --> 15:38.560
It'd be easier to answer what doesn't get periods.

15:38.560 --> 15:40.000
Rocks, trees.

15:40.000 --> 15:40.960
Armchairs.

15:40.960 --> 15:41.460
Clouds.

15:42.400 --> 15:43.680
Rain is just cloud periods.

15:43.680 --> 15:44.180
Nope.

15:45.040 --> 15:47.680
This is accurate, this is scientific.

15:47.680 --> 15:49.120
I saw that on Bill Nye.

15:49.120 --> 15:50.960
I think the most pain-free way,

15:50.960 --> 15:53.280
well it's not pain-free but you don't have to

15:53.280 --> 15:57.040
put additional unrequired pain

15:57.040 --> 15:59.120
is just wait till you both accidentally

15:59.120 --> 16:00.720
cut yourselves naturally.

16:01.360 --> 16:04.080
Like on a, well cliff diving or something.

16:05.520 --> 16:06.720
Try to use your iPhone.

16:06.720 --> 16:07.760
Why won't you pick up?

16:07.760 --> 16:08.960
This is gonna clot soon.

16:08.960 --> 16:10.640
Dude, you gotta get down here.

16:11.760 --> 16:13.360
You could obviously just get those necklaces

16:13.360 --> 16:15.200
that were like two halves of hearts

16:15.200 --> 16:17.280
that look like they have broken in two

16:17.280 --> 16:19.040
and said like best friends forever.

16:19.040 --> 16:23.120
But the ones I just said like B-E-F-R-I-F-O-R

16:23.760 --> 16:25.120
and then half of the E.

16:25.120 --> 16:26.480
And then you cut yourself with them?

16:26.480 --> 16:27.680
And then you cut yourself sharp?

16:27.680 --> 16:29.760
And then you jam it in each other's eyeballs.

16:30.400 --> 16:32.640
Don't think they want to trade eye viscera.

16:32.640 --> 16:34.160
Well and then you switch them.

16:34.160 --> 16:36.320
So you pluck out the eyeballs and you switch the eyeballs

16:36.320 --> 16:38.080
and then you can see how the other person sees.

16:38.080 --> 16:39.440
We're eye viscera brothers.

16:40.160 --> 16:42.800
It's a totally, it's a totally weird thing.

16:42.800 --> 16:44.320
We're marrow bros.

16:44.320 --> 16:45.360
Marrow bros.

16:45.360 --> 16:46.480
Super marrow bros.

16:47.280 --> 16:48.160
That's good.

16:48.160 --> 16:49.840
Why don't you just wait for a nose bleed?

16:50.880 --> 16:53.200
And then like sneeze into, oh God.

16:53.200 --> 16:55.120
And then rub your nose blood into his nose.

16:55.120 --> 16:56.720
I'll give each other Eskimo kisses

16:56.720 --> 16:57.920
while having a nose bleed.

16:57.920 --> 17:00.000
Oh, what about jizz pals?

17:01.920 --> 17:07.520
Hey, everybody, can we just like go to the movies

17:07.520 --> 17:10.960
and see Pacific Rim and maybe go to Max and Irma's after

17:10.960 --> 17:14.800
and not trade bodily fluids to prove our love?

17:14.800 --> 17:16.400
Are you guys not blood brothers with anybody?

17:17.120 --> 17:18.240
I'm blood brothers with you.

17:18.240 --> 17:20.880
You, that's not, come on.

17:21.920 --> 17:23.360
We're not even blood brothers with each other

17:23.360 --> 17:24.880
because we haven't fucking cut ourselves

17:24.880 --> 17:27.040
and slapped each other's palms with it.

17:27.040 --> 17:29.440
Our DNA is very similar.

17:29.440 --> 17:31.280
You must have said D and D.

17:31.280 --> 17:33.280
Our D and D is so legit.

17:33.280 --> 17:34.320
So similar.

17:34.320 --> 17:35.200
It's very similar.

17:35.200 --> 17:36.240
You're telling me you have never-

17:36.240 --> 17:37.680
Look at this strand of D and D.

17:37.680 --> 17:39.920
You have never locked friends.

17:39.920 --> 17:43.120
You've never locked eyes with a best buddy forever

17:43.760 --> 17:46.640
and been like, let's give each other some hemoglobin.

17:47.680 --> 17:49.040
I actually feel like I did.

17:49.040 --> 17:49.920
I have done that.

17:50.480 --> 17:51.600
Who'd you do it with?

17:51.600 --> 17:52.240
Alex White.

17:53.920 --> 17:57.040
Cut ourselves on this wire

17:57.040 --> 17:59.280
that was sticking out of a tennis net.

17:59.840 --> 18:01.280
Excellent choice.

18:01.280 --> 18:02.240
Excellent choice.

18:02.240 --> 18:03.840
Rusty as shit.

18:03.840 --> 18:05.600
It was sharp as shit and it got the job done.

18:05.600 --> 18:08.240
And now I feel a kindredness with him.

18:08.240 --> 18:09.840
Can you tell when he is in strife?

18:10.400 --> 18:13.200
I can tell when he's eating a really good plate

18:13.200 --> 18:14.000
of cheese fries.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.840
I can tell when he's dying of tetanus

18:15.840 --> 18:16.880
and it's all the time.

18:17.920 --> 18:19.200
Cause he has it now.

18:19.200 --> 18:20.320
Well, if he goes and I go,

18:20.320 --> 18:22.080
it's that fucking dragon heart shit.

18:22.960 --> 18:25.600
Justin, who are you blood brothers with?

18:26.160 --> 18:28.640
Some of my friends in college did gang burns.

18:30.800 --> 18:33.520
You had the best group of friends in college.

18:33.520 --> 18:34.480
Does that count?

18:34.480 --> 18:35.760
Some of them still have scarring.

18:35.760 --> 18:37.920
If you see my friend Jason, ask to see his arm.

18:37.920 --> 18:40.080
Is that just where you light a lighter for a long time

18:40.080 --> 18:41.600
and then put that on your flesh or what?

18:41.600 --> 18:43.760
You put it on your flesh and you wait for it to...

18:43.760 --> 18:44.960
And then I think,

18:44.960 --> 18:48.080
and I didn't question this that much in college,

18:48.080 --> 18:52.720
but I think sort of essential to this is that

18:54.080 --> 18:56.800
it can't cure properly.

18:56.800 --> 18:58.160
Like the better it heals,

18:58.800 --> 19:02.080
the less cool the gang burn is gonna be.

19:02.080 --> 19:04.640
Cause you definitely want some scarring going on there.

19:04.640 --> 19:06.560
So is that a less painful option

19:06.560 --> 19:08.400
than like pricking yourself with a needle?

19:09.200 --> 19:11.280
It's less like ghoulish, I think.

19:12.240 --> 19:12.800
Really?

19:12.800 --> 19:13.680
Really, dog?

19:14.400 --> 19:17.120
And probably funnier later.

19:17.120 --> 19:18.720
Cause there are people that prick themselves

19:18.720 --> 19:20.400
with like diabetic people,

19:20.400 --> 19:23.200
prick themselves every day for their tests and shit.

19:23.200 --> 19:25.280
Very few people burn themselves.

19:25.280 --> 19:29.040
Yeah, unless they have like chronic leeches or something.

19:29.040 --> 19:30.240
I didn't get one.

19:30.240 --> 19:32.720
And I actually started thinking about this last week.

19:33.360 --> 19:37.360
Like I kind of wished that I had

19:37.360 --> 19:39.360
cause it would be kind of a funny story

19:39.360 --> 19:40.960
and it would make me feel like,

19:40.960 --> 19:43.920
oh, there's a real reminder I carry around for my college days.

19:43.920 --> 19:46.320
And the thought crossed my mind

19:46.320 --> 19:48.000
and then another thought crossed my mind

19:48.000 --> 19:50.320
and I thought that ship's probably sailed.

19:51.040 --> 19:53.680
I don't think I could get people over to my house

19:53.680 --> 19:55.920
to watch me burn my arm with a lighter anymore.

19:55.920 --> 19:57.200
I'm 32 goddamn years old.

19:57.200 --> 19:58.720
They have to take care of their kids

19:58.720 --> 20:00.080
and they've got to work in the morning.

20:00.080 --> 20:00.400
Right.

20:01.520 --> 20:04.480
Can you gang brain yourself by like 9.30

20:04.480 --> 20:05.600
cause I have to get home.

20:06.240 --> 20:06.720
Why don't you,

20:07.520 --> 20:10.640
if you want like visual reminders of your college age,

20:10.640 --> 20:12.640
why don't you just get back into frosting your tips?

20:14.240 --> 20:14.800
That could work.

20:16.240 --> 20:18.080
I didn't have to frost my tips.

20:18.080 --> 20:19.040
Yes, you did.

20:19.040 --> 20:19.840
No, I didn't.

20:19.840 --> 20:20.560
Yes, you did.

20:21.840 --> 20:23.360
You would have frosted my tips.

20:23.360 --> 20:24.560
There was a hair coloring.

20:24.560 --> 20:25.360
You went with,

20:25.360 --> 20:29.120
I think you went with what's her face to get it done

20:29.120 --> 20:30.960
and there's some leftover stuff

20:30.960 --> 20:31.600
and they were like,

20:31.600 --> 20:32.960
we just put it in your hair and you're like,

20:32.960 --> 20:33.520
okay.

20:33.520 --> 20:35.920
And you came home and you fucking had your tips frosted.

20:35.920 --> 20:37.040
Oh my God.

20:37.040 --> 20:37.920
You're right.

20:37.920 --> 20:39.040
I forgot.

20:39.040 --> 20:40.560
That was not frosting my tips.

20:40.560 --> 20:43.040
I was getting some highlights in cause you're right.

20:43.040 --> 20:46.400
I did do home highlights and it went poorly.

20:49.360 --> 20:51.920
Does it help you out that when I think of college Justin,

20:51.920 --> 20:57.440
I think of fucking Justin McElroy hyphen Timberlake

20:57.440 --> 20:59.840
from It's Gonna Be Me.

20:59.840 --> 21:03.360
I wish I'd had that kind of salon quality highlighting.

21:03.360 --> 21:04.320
It wasn't far off.

21:05.440 --> 21:06.000
Thank you.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.080
You know, it was my first time.

21:09.360 --> 21:10.160
Shot for the stars.

21:10.880 --> 21:13.440
So our next question asker got a new job.

21:13.440 --> 21:18.720
She's, she handles reimbursions for gym memberships,

21:18.720 --> 21:20.240
which their company gives out,

21:20.240 --> 21:22.640
but the employees have to turn in their bank statements

21:22.640 --> 21:24.960
to prove that they actually got this, right?

21:24.960 --> 21:28.480
Uh, and usually they cross out the bank statements,

21:28.480 --> 21:31.440
but she says one of her coworkers submitted his statement

21:31.440 --> 21:33.200
without crossing anything out.

21:33.200 --> 21:35.600
And I noticed that the monthly charge from the gym,

21:35.600 --> 21:39.280
it was right below a monthly charge to max fun

21:39.280 --> 21:40.640
on each month statement.

21:42.080 --> 21:44.400
The problem is I just started working here

21:44.400 --> 21:48.400
and this is literally the only thing I know about the guy.

21:48.400 --> 21:50.320
How do I bring it up and bond with this dude

21:50.320 --> 21:52.400
over our awesome taste and podcasts

21:52.400 --> 21:55.360
without being crazy awkward or seeming like a total creeper?

21:55.360 --> 21:58.160
That's from Sincerely, the new receptionist girl.

21:58.160 --> 21:58.960
Oh, you can't.

22:00.240 --> 22:01.040
I can.

22:03.680 --> 22:07.120
Option one, go to maxfundstore.com.

22:08.160 --> 22:09.360
Buy my brother, my brother.

22:09.360 --> 22:13.040
Of course, Justin tries to work as much merch

22:13.040 --> 22:15.280
into option one as he possibly can.

22:15.280 --> 22:17.040
Option one merch.

22:17.040 --> 22:18.720
If you want to go a little cheaper,

22:18.720 --> 22:19.680
if he doesn't respond,

22:19.680 --> 22:21.360
he probably doesn't listen to our show

22:21.360 --> 22:23.440
and he listens to another show on Max Fund,

22:23.440 --> 22:25.840
unlikely as that may be to consider.

22:25.840 --> 22:28.000
So you gotta buy shirts from everybody.

22:29.600 --> 22:32.880
Oh, buy a Jumbotron message calling him out.

22:34.880 --> 22:36.320
I know you're a fan.

22:36.320 --> 22:37.440
Or submit a question.

22:39.360 --> 22:40.880
This guy is probably like, wait a minute, did I?

22:40.880 --> 22:43.520
Did I cross out my bank statement?

22:43.520 --> 22:46.080
Does she also know about my extreme restraints purposes?

22:46.640 --> 22:47.440
Oh no.

22:47.440 --> 22:50.000
You could start singing theme songs.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
God knows I tried some awkward shit like that

22:52.000 --> 22:52.720
in high school and college.

22:52.720 --> 22:54.160
I can't remember anything specific.

22:54.160 --> 22:56.080
But when you think someone's into something

22:56.080 --> 22:57.520
and you're not like a regular human

22:57.520 --> 23:01.040
who can just say, hey, I noticed on your bank statement

23:01.040 --> 23:02.560
that I was looking at, okay, you're right.

23:02.560 --> 23:04.480
There is no actually cool way to do that.

23:04.480 --> 23:07.760
No, there was like a month and a half long period

23:07.760 --> 23:10.480
in your life, Justin, where you were emboldened enough

23:10.480 --> 23:11.920
to make that kind of leap,

23:11.920 --> 23:14.240
to sing a theme song in front of somebody.

23:14.240 --> 23:16.880
And I think it pretty much aligned perfectly

23:16.880 --> 23:18.320
with when you had Frosted Tips.

23:18.320 --> 23:20.320
They were highlights.

23:21.360 --> 23:22.480
That was your power look.

23:25.120 --> 23:28.080
I think that maybe you could just lock the information away

23:28.080 --> 23:31.760
in your brain bank until maybe you just randomly

23:31.760 --> 23:33.760
get to know this dude and then you can be like,

23:33.760 --> 23:35.440
oh, I noticed I was doing the thing.

23:35.440 --> 23:36.640
No, like you can't.

23:36.640 --> 23:37.600
This is the thing though.

23:40.080 --> 23:44.320
To look at anything that is not like Big Ted's muscle barn

23:44.320 --> 23:48.720
on his bank statement is an invasion of his privacy.

23:48.720 --> 23:50.080
She can't ever cop to it.

23:51.520 --> 23:54.080
Yeah, because the thing above that,

23:54.080 --> 23:56.480
the thing above that part on his statement could be

23:58.080 --> 24:01.920
the Jerkoff Tavern.

24:01.920 --> 24:04.000
Now, there's probably a better name for it,

24:04.000 --> 24:05.280
but like a place where people go.

24:05.280 --> 24:07.360
That's the weirdest bar I've ever heard of.

24:07.360 --> 24:11.920
Yakov Jerkoff's Russian masturbation house.

24:11.920 --> 24:14.320
It's like one of those places.

24:14.320 --> 24:16.080
It's like a Japanese capsule hotel,

24:17.760 --> 24:18.240
but-

24:18.240 --> 24:19.680
Filled with Jerkoff capsules.

24:19.680 --> 24:23.440
Masturbating in it, happening mostly.

24:23.440 --> 24:25.600
Happening there inside the capsules.

24:25.600 --> 24:26.880
And it's owned by Yakov Smirnoff.

24:26.880 --> 24:28.160
And it's owned by him also.

24:28.160 --> 24:29.680
He's really branching out.

24:29.680 --> 24:30.160
He is branching out.

24:30.160 --> 24:31.680
He's an entrepreneur.

24:31.680 --> 24:35.200
He's got a show in Branson that I would trade anything

24:35.200 --> 24:36.160
to go see.

24:36.160 --> 24:38.720
It's like, you want to talk about my bucket list?

24:38.720 --> 24:40.000
It's just that.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.720
I believe he's had a show in Branson

24:42.720 --> 24:44.640
for like 20 plus years.

24:45.360 --> 24:45.680
Right.

24:45.680 --> 24:47.440
And the fact that with every year,

24:47.440 --> 24:49.200
it becomes more likely that he's going to say,

24:49.200 --> 24:51.120
well, I've done it all.

24:51.120 --> 24:52.560
Time to wrap up the show.

24:52.560 --> 24:53.600
Time to die now.

24:55.040 --> 24:58.000
I'm going to walk into the ocean in Branson

24:58.000 --> 24:58.720
and then I'll be like-

24:58.720 --> 25:00.240
And have a dolphin murder me.

25:01.680 --> 25:03.120
To put me out of my-

25:03.120 --> 25:06.000
In my country, dolphin kills you.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.160
How's that low-hanging fruit taste, Charlie?

25:08.160 --> 25:10.800
It's pretty good.

25:10.800 --> 25:12.560
It's low-hanging, Dominic.

25:12.560 --> 25:13.120
Sweet.

25:13.120 --> 25:15.840
I know it's a bit mealy, but that's okay.

25:16.400 --> 25:18.720
I got a Yahoo sent in to us by Julie Martin.

25:18.720 --> 25:19.600
Thank you, Julie Martin.

25:22.720 --> 25:24.560
And I've got a conspiracy theory

25:24.560 --> 25:27.440
because this question was asked three months ago

25:28.320 --> 25:30.960
by Yahoo Answers user, Mins, who asks,

25:32.640 --> 25:35.920
what would happen if a shark got caught

25:35.920 --> 25:38.320
in a whirlpool or hurricane?

25:38.320 --> 25:39.440
Wait a minute.

25:39.440 --> 25:40.480
Hold on a second.

25:41.680 --> 25:42.880
When you get sucked into a whirlpool,

25:42.880 --> 25:43.680
you can't get out, most likely,

25:43.680 --> 25:44.080
and you drown.

25:44.080 --> 25:45.120
Sharks don't need oxygen,

25:45.120 --> 25:46.400
so would anything happen to harm them?

25:47.520 --> 25:48.960
Now about that hurricane.

25:50.160 --> 25:51.440
Would the hurricane be strong enough

25:51.440 --> 25:52.480
to carry the shark long enough

25:52.480 --> 25:53.440
that it would fall onto land?

25:55.280 --> 25:58.560
Sounds a little suspiciously familiar, doesn't it?

25:58.560 --> 26:00.480
Yeah, that's a little sketchy.

26:00.480 --> 26:02.800
I'm not, I'm, listen,

26:02.800 --> 26:04.400
we all experienced the same moment of magic

26:04.400 --> 26:06.400
when we watched the Sharknado trailer together.

26:06.400 --> 26:08.160
Well, not together, not like in the same room,

26:08.160 --> 26:11.200
but like our fucking hearts and minds were connected

26:11.200 --> 26:12.480
in a moment of joy.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.160
Not because of the quality of the film itself,

26:16.160 --> 26:17.120
there was terror also.

26:18.640 --> 26:20.240
But the fact that we live in a world

26:20.240 --> 26:24.480
where that harbors a beautiful mind

26:24.480 --> 26:26.240
capable of dreaming up Sharknado.

26:27.440 --> 26:29.440
And now that fucking perception

26:29.440 --> 26:31.120
that magic moment I had is fucking ruined

26:31.120 --> 26:33.680
because I think they're just dumpster diving

26:34.560 --> 26:35.920
into Yahoo Answers.

26:36.800 --> 26:38.160
Looking for topics that-

26:38.160 --> 26:40.720
Looking for topics to make their movies about.

26:40.720 --> 26:42.080
Do you think they could put together

26:42.080 --> 26:43.840
an entire movie in three months?

26:44.480 --> 26:48.000
I think Sci-Fi can put an entire movie together

26:48.000 --> 26:50.160
in three and a half days.

26:51.520 --> 26:52.480
I think they have to get,

26:52.480 --> 26:55.520
I think they have Lorenzo Lamas on Container,

26:56.000 --> 26:56.960
on Retainer.

26:56.960 --> 26:58.400
They have him in a container.

26:58.400 --> 27:00.480
They have him in a container.

27:00.480 --> 27:02.560
They gave Lorenzo Lamas a Retainer.

27:03.520 --> 27:06.240
In a container that they keep downstairs.

27:06.240 --> 27:07.360
They go downstairs to say,

27:07.360 --> 27:08.560
hey, Lorenzo, he's like,

27:08.560 --> 27:10.160
food time, feed, feed.

27:10.160 --> 27:12.160
And they say, no, not feed time, not feed feed.

27:13.520 --> 27:15.280
We're doing a movie.

27:15.280 --> 27:16.560
It's about sharks and tornadoes.

27:16.560 --> 27:17.040
Are you in?

27:18.240 --> 27:20.160
Yeah, this is gonna sound cynical.

27:20.160 --> 27:22.480
We'll give you four walnuts, Lorenzo.

27:23.520 --> 27:24.160
Excellent.

27:25.200 --> 27:26.240
This is gonna sound cynical,

27:26.240 --> 27:27.360
so I apologize in advance,

27:27.360 --> 27:30.720
but you look at Ancient Rome, right?

27:30.720 --> 27:32.800
And you look at the fall of Ancient Rome

27:32.800 --> 27:37.200
and people say, you think about all the,

27:38.160 --> 27:40.720
that civilization was producing such amazing things.

27:40.720 --> 27:42.160
If it had continued on,

27:42.160 --> 27:45.440
who knows how far we could have gotten.

27:45.440 --> 27:48.320
But I think if you look at America

27:48.320 --> 27:52.240
as sort of an empire that's had a really good run,

27:52.240 --> 27:55.040
I think we may have gone sort of past,

27:55.040 --> 27:58.480
like if we were to fall tomorrow

27:58.480 --> 28:03.680
and history dictated the rise and fall of America,

28:04.400 --> 28:08.960
considering the fall was like post Sharknado,

28:09.600 --> 28:11.120
I think we've kind of done

28:11.120 --> 28:13.600
all that we were maybe constructed to do.

28:14.560 --> 28:16.080
If you will pardon the pun,

28:16.640 --> 28:19.920
I believe we may have jumped the Sharknado as a country,

28:19.920 --> 28:20.800
just as a whole concept.

28:20.800 --> 28:25.280
Well, first of all, nothing can jump a Sharknado.

28:25.280 --> 28:29.840
Fucking space shuttles can't escape orbit

28:29.840 --> 28:30.880
when there's a Sharknado.

28:31.840 --> 28:32.320
Fair enough.

28:32.960 --> 28:35.360
And also, if you're saying that Sharknado

28:35.920 --> 28:38.560
is the peak that things are going to start descending from,

28:38.560 --> 28:42.080
then you obviously did not see Megafault

28:42.080 --> 28:43.760
starring Brittany Murphy, her final obit.

28:43.760 --> 28:44.260
No.

28:45.840 --> 28:47.840
I'm saying we peaked at like,

28:47.840 --> 28:50.400
in like with like The Godfather, maybe.

28:50.400 --> 28:53.280
Like that was where we should have gone out on.

28:53.280 --> 28:56.400
And then after that, it was all Sharknado and Cloud Atlas,

28:56.400 --> 28:59.360
and it's all just been sort of downhill from-

28:59.360 --> 29:03.120
Are Cloud Atlas and Sharknado on the same level of movie?

29:03.120 --> 29:04.960
Well, they're based on the same book.

29:04.960 --> 29:08.080
Oh, Tom Hanks plays nine of the sharks in Sharknado.

29:08.960 --> 29:09.760
And you know what?

29:09.760 --> 29:10.640
He is brilliant.

29:10.640 --> 29:12.880
He is electrifying.

29:12.880 --> 29:16.320
Tom Hanks is in a new movie where he plays Walt Disney

29:16.320 --> 29:20.720
and he's all shook, smiling, happy Walt Disney.

29:20.720 --> 29:23.280
And it makes me feel like I'm a crazy person

29:23.280 --> 29:25.120
because are we just all going to pretend

29:25.120 --> 29:27.440
he wasn't a huge anti-Semite?

29:27.440 --> 29:31.520
Like on the reg, professional anti-Semite all the time,

29:31.520 --> 29:33.680
all day, every day, hating Jews.

29:33.680 --> 29:36.320
Like are we going to pretend that that's not the case

29:36.320 --> 29:37.680
and just make a movie about him?

29:37.680 --> 29:38.880
Is Disney producing the film?

29:39.600 --> 29:41.680
Because if so, that's a fucking master-

29:41.680 --> 29:43.200
That's a masterful move on their part.

29:43.200 --> 29:46.080
Because even if Tom Hanks was an IRL,

29:46.080 --> 29:48.880
if you could attribute all of the terrible things

29:48.880 --> 29:51.280
that Mel Gibson has ever done to Tom Hanks,

29:51.280 --> 29:53.040
people wouldn't give a fuck about it.

29:53.760 --> 29:55.840
We would be forgiving him like mid-sentence.

29:55.840 --> 29:58.480
Because of that half chubby face of his is so lovable.

29:58.480 --> 30:00.640
Let's make some money of our own.

30:00.640 --> 30:02.960
Let's not leave it all for Tom Hanks of Walt Disney.

30:02.960 --> 30:14.560
Let's go to Moneys of Gold.

30:14.560 --> 30:17.280
I met this guy this weekend named Warby Parker.

30:17.920 --> 30:23.120
He's a scientist and his specialty is glasses.

30:23.120 --> 30:24.000
He's bifocals.

30:24.560 --> 30:25.600
He's bifocals.

30:25.600 --> 30:27.840
So my buddy Warby, he says to me,

30:27.840 --> 30:29.360
Justin, this has gone far enough.

30:29.360 --> 30:32.240
Glasses should not cost as much as an iPhone.

30:32.880 --> 30:36.080
I'm going to sell prescription glasses starting at $95,

30:37.520 --> 30:39.920
including prescription lenses.

30:39.920 --> 30:41.120
Forget about it.

30:41.120 --> 30:43.920
And I'm like, Warby, you've lost your mind.

30:43.920 --> 30:44.880
Quick question, Justin.

30:44.880 --> 30:46.000
What is Warby short for?

30:46.800 --> 30:47.680
Warbleton.

30:47.680 --> 30:49.120
So Warby says to me,

30:51.360 --> 30:52.480
I know what you're thinking.

30:52.480 --> 30:54.480
It's a crazy idea selling glasses on the internet

30:54.480 --> 30:57.920
because you don't get to try them on.

30:57.920 --> 30:59.120
He's like, so here's my plan.

31:00.480 --> 31:04.000
I'm going to send people five pairs of glasses.

31:04.800 --> 31:06.080
But they only wanted one.

31:07.440 --> 31:10.080
Why is he burying his audience in glasses?

31:10.080 --> 31:12.560
Warbleton is very forceful with his product.

31:12.560 --> 31:15.920
You're going to send him back four of them,

31:16.640 --> 31:17.280
and then you keep one.

31:17.280 --> 31:19.360
All smashed, smashed to bits.

31:19.360 --> 31:20.400
Smashed to bits.

31:20.400 --> 31:24.080
I hate these, and this one, and this one.

31:24.080 --> 31:24.880
And I hate them all.

31:24.880 --> 31:27.360
What did Warbleton call this program?

31:29.200 --> 31:30.160
He's not very clever.

31:30.160 --> 31:32.000
He called it the home try-on program.

31:32.000 --> 31:33.760
He needs some help there.

31:33.760 --> 31:35.920
But it is a pretty good idea.

31:36.480 --> 31:40.400
And he does non-prescription polarized sunglasses

31:40.400 --> 31:44.000
from 95 bucks and prescription polarized sunglasses

31:44.880 --> 31:46.160
from $150.

31:46.160 --> 31:46.880
And get this.

31:46.880 --> 31:48.400
This is sort of the cherry on top.

31:49.040 --> 31:51.120
For every pair of glasses he sells,

31:51.120 --> 31:51.920
he's very generous.

31:51.920 --> 31:55.440
He's going to distribute a pair of glasses to someone in need.

31:56.240 --> 32:00.480
This guy Warby is making it fucking rain bifocals.

32:00.480 --> 32:02.000
I know everybody.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.800
I don't need glasses, and I'm going to start because of this.

32:04.800 --> 32:07.040
I'm going to go to warbyparker.com.

32:07.040 --> 32:11.440
That's W-A-R-B-Y-P-A-R-K-E-R dot com.

32:12.000 --> 32:15.600
And here's the sweetest part.

32:16.240 --> 32:20.400
He said if you enter the code MYBROTHER, all one word,

32:20.400 --> 32:24.240
then you can get new glasses in three business days

32:25.040 --> 32:28.400
rather than the usual however long it takes.

32:28.400 --> 32:29.280
Longer than that.

32:29.280 --> 32:31.040
10 usually, I think.

32:31.040 --> 32:32.240
10 business days usually.

32:32.240 --> 32:33.760
He's going to give them to you in three

32:33.760 --> 32:36.560
because he's so tight with me, Justin McElroy.

32:36.560 --> 32:37.840
So go to warbyparker.com.

32:37.840 --> 32:39.280
I'm glad you met Warby Parker.

32:39.280 --> 32:40.400
I know, he seems like a good dude.

32:40.400 --> 32:43.760
Go to warbyparker.com, use the coupon code MYBROTHER,

32:43.760 --> 32:47.200
and get those glasses fast and get your face right.

32:47.200 --> 32:49.520
What if you have 10 eyeballs?

32:49.520 --> 32:50.640
Can you keep all the glasses?

32:51.680 --> 32:54.320
I think you can, but I think you're going to pay a premium.

32:54.320 --> 32:56.400
Yeah, a mutant premium.

32:57.440 --> 33:00.560
I have a message to listener Eric with a Y

33:01.280 --> 33:03.520
from his cousins, the Regan brothers,

33:03.520 --> 33:06.080
who says, hi, Eric, we know that chemo blows,

33:06.080 --> 33:08.160
so we wanted to say, hey, cheer up.

33:08.160 --> 33:09.920
The Mubim Bam brothers totes rejected

33:09.920 --> 33:11.680
your cancer etiquette question,

33:11.680 --> 33:14.160
so we wanted to give you a chance to finally hear them,

33:14.160 --> 33:16.560
their premium colon cancer goose.

33:16.560 --> 33:18.080
Hopefully it makes all the nausea and fatigue

33:18.080 --> 33:19.120
go down a little easier.

33:19.120 --> 33:22.400
Signed, Tom, Joe, John, and Pete.

33:22.400 --> 33:26.160
Hey, Tom, Joe, John, and Pete, go fuck yourselves.

33:26.160 --> 33:31.120
Wow, guys, just because you pay to do a message like this,

33:31.120 --> 33:32.960
you think this means you can just abuse us?

33:32.960 --> 33:35.360
We're not dancing monkeys.

33:37.280 --> 33:38.800
Do you guys like how quixotically

33:38.800 --> 33:40.800
I just charged into that message?

33:40.800 --> 33:44.000
That was a sensitive message, a very accusatory message.

33:44.000 --> 33:44.960
It was.

33:44.960 --> 33:48.160
I was just like, fuck it, let's just do this thing.

33:48.160 --> 33:49.680
I felt attacked a little bit.

33:50.720 --> 33:51.920
Did you feel attacked by Griffin?

33:51.920 --> 33:53.040
Because I feel like that a lot.

33:54.400 --> 33:56.640
Basically, I mean, not like verbally.

33:56.640 --> 33:57.760
Griffin was just a messenger.

33:57.760 --> 33:58.880
I'm not going to fall in for that.

33:58.880 --> 34:00.800
Griffin's also kind of a dig.

34:00.800 --> 34:01.760
Hey, shut the fuck up.

34:01.760 --> 34:03.680
Hey, Eric, get feeling better, buddy.

34:04.320 --> 34:05.280
Yeah, beat that thing.

34:05.280 --> 34:06.560
Yeah, Eric, we love your ass.

34:07.920 --> 34:11.120
Wait, not the part of your ass that has cancer, of course.

34:11.120 --> 34:12.160
We just want that gone.

34:13.120 --> 34:15.760
Not the cancer, the part of your ass can stay,

34:15.760 --> 34:17.040
but the cancer on it sucks.

34:17.600 --> 34:18.320
Get out of here.

34:18.320 --> 34:19.120
Get out of here, you.

34:20.560 --> 34:22.720
Max Hayes, and I got a message to you from,

34:22.720 --> 34:24.880
and this is just what was written here,

34:24.880 --> 34:26.480
so I have to read what's here.

34:27.120 --> 34:28.720
Philly cheesesteak and kiwi.

34:28.720 --> 34:32.560
They say, happy birthday to MBMBAM's biggest Canadian fan.

34:32.560 --> 34:34.640
Maxie, we love you, and this is the best

34:34.640 --> 34:36.880
slash most appropriate gift we could think of for you.

34:37.680 --> 34:40.080
Wish we could see you in person when you hear this,

34:40.080 --> 34:40.880
but such is life.

34:41.680 --> 34:46.480
That's from, he says, PS, Mario Lopez dispenser.

34:46.480 --> 34:49.200
Maybe that's perhaps a private joke that they stole from us.

34:49.200 --> 34:53.520
Yeah, and it's not so private, because we said it a while ago,

34:53.520 --> 34:54.020
TM.

34:55.040 --> 34:56.560
Happy birthday, TM.

34:56.560 --> 35:03.440
Happy birthday, TM, to Max Hayes, and I hope it's a great one,

35:04.720 --> 35:07.680
and I hope you can introduce us to your friends,

35:07.680 --> 35:10.240
Philly cheesesteak and kiwi.

35:10.800 --> 35:12.880
Which is also what I'm going to have for lunch,

35:12.880 --> 35:14.960
so thank you for putting that idea into my head.

35:15.680 --> 35:17.920
That classic joke.

35:17.920 --> 35:21.280
I will move on to this, Travis.

35:22.240 --> 35:25.440
You know, I have a little anecdote.

35:25.440 --> 35:28.640
So, today, or no, a couple days ago,

35:28.640 --> 35:31.520
while hunting for props for our upcoming show,

35:32.160 --> 35:34.800
I found myself in an adult store.

35:35.760 --> 35:40.000
Is the show too huge dicks of Verona?

35:40.000 --> 35:44.000
Well, I needed some handcuffs for non-sensual purposes,

35:45.120 --> 35:50.080
and I stopped into an adult store that I will not say the name of,

35:50.080 --> 35:53.280
because I don't want to cause any bad blood,

35:53.280 --> 35:56.320
but let's just say it was named after an adult magazine,

35:57.360 --> 36:02.320
and it was the skeeziest place with poor selection

36:02.960 --> 36:06.400
and not quality product I've ever been in.

36:06.400 --> 36:08.960
I felt dirty, and I felt wrong,

36:08.960 --> 36:11.920
and I did not hold a candle to Extreme Restraints.

36:13.920 --> 36:15.600
Why didn't you just go to Extreme Restraints?

36:16.480 --> 36:18.880
Because I needed it, I needed it fast.

36:18.880 --> 36:20.080
I needed it that day.

36:20.080 --> 36:20.580
Yeah.

36:20.580 --> 36:26.100
Now, to be clear, Extreme Restraints may not be able to get you sexual toys that day,

36:26.100 --> 36:28.180
but they do get them to you fast.

36:28.180 --> 36:33.460
It's the world's greatest, in my opinion, adult superstore.

36:33.460 --> 36:34.100
No, fuck that.

36:34.100 --> 36:34.980
That's not opinion.

36:34.980 --> 36:36.420
That shit is fact.

36:37.140 --> 36:41.060
That shit, we have categorical evidence to support the fact

36:41.060 --> 36:43.620
that it's the best sex site in the world.

36:43.620 --> 36:45.140
It's the best site in the world.

36:45.140 --> 36:46.180
Fuck Google.

36:46.180 --> 36:46.900
Sorry, Google.

36:46.900 --> 36:51.220
It's also, they actually are changing the name of the site to fuck Google.

36:51.220 --> 36:51.720
Got you.

36:53.940 --> 36:58.820
Penis pumps, penis pump accessory, large penis pump pills.

36:58.820 --> 37:00.340
These are small penis pump pills.

37:00.340 --> 37:01.300
Small penis, but these are just a few.

37:01.300 --> 37:03.860
Maybe your penis is too big, and you want to make your penis smaller.

37:05.300 --> 37:08.580
These are just a few things that I've bought from ExtremeRestraints.com,

37:08.580 --> 37:10.340
and you can get some of your own.

37:10.340 --> 37:14.340
It's like the fucking eat me, drink me stuff from Alice in Wonderland.

37:14.340 --> 37:16.420
You have to take the large penis pills,

37:16.420 --> 37:19.540
but then you have to have a small one to balance it out.

37:19.540 --> 37:21.540
If you want to get anything done with your day,

37:21.540 --> 37:23.300
you have to take the small penis pill,

37:23.300 --> 37:25.300
or else you are exhausted by midday.

37:25.300 --> 37:26.980
This company is fantastic.

37:26.980 --> 37:28.660
They've always been so good to us.

37:28.660 --> 37:30.180
We love them very, very, very much,

37:30.180 --> 37:31.620
and we hope you'll go support them,

37:31.620 --> 37:34.260
and use the coupon code Sexabunga,

37:34.260 --> 37:37.780
and you can save 20% at ExtremeRestraints.com.

37:37.780 --> 37:38.500
I hope you'll shame-

37:38.500 --> 37:42.100
I love that every time you say Sexabunga, you get so just happy.

37:42.100 --> 37:44.100
It's such a good code word.

37:44.100 --> 37:46.580
It is, and it'll be here for maybe another week.

37:48.020 --> 37:48.580
I'm just sad.

37:48.580 --> 37:51.220
I don't want to be a defeatist, but hackers are everywhere,

37:51.220 --> 37:52.420
especially Chinese hackers.

37:52.420 --> 37:54.340
We get hit like a million times a day.

37:56.180 --> 37:56.740
Hackers.

37:57.540 --> 37:58.420
WikiLeaks.

37:59.380 --> 37:59.860
It's all-

38:00.820 --> 38:03.060
We asked Snowden to build us a fucking firewall,

38:03.620 --> 38:06.180
but he couldn't because he didn't have corporeal hands.

38:06.180 --> 38:08.500
Yes, I'm still working on it, brother.

38:08.500 --> 38:08.980
Thank you.

38:08.980 --> 38:09.460
Thank you, Gust-

38:09.460 --> 38:10.660
I will have it to you soon.

38:10.660 --> 38:11.620
Thank you, Gustin.

38:11.620 --> 38:12.340
Let's move on.

38:12.340 --> 38:14.260
When will it be done, you ask?

38:14.260 --> 38:15.540
It's a secret.

38:15.540 --> 38:16.040
Okay.

38:18.660 --> 38:19.220
Hi, everybody.

38:19.220 --> 38:20.500
My name's Justin McElroy.

38:20.500 --> 38:22.260
And I'm Dr. Sydney McElroy.

38:22.260 --> 38:23.540
I'm Dr. Sydney McElroy.

38:23.540 --> 38:25.380
Yeah, you told me to introduce myself that way.

38:25.380 --> 38:27.380
We're the newest addition to the Maximum Fun family.

38:27.380 --> 38:28.660
Our show is called Sawbones.

38:28.660 --> 38:32.020
It's a medical history program where we detail all the dumb,

38:32.020 --> 38:35.380
hurtful, stupid ways that we've tried to fix people over the years.

38:35.380 --> 38:38.580
Have you tried to put mercury on your syphilis shanker?

38:38.580 --> 38:38.900
Yep.

38:38.900 --> 38:41.140
Or maybe you tried to drill a hole in your head

38:41.140 --> 38:43.940
because you heard it would reduce your blood-brain volume.

38:43.940 --> 38:45.620
It probably didn't work.

38:45.620 --> 38:48.020
But the good news is you're in great company.

38:48.020 --> 38:50.740
You can hear all about it every Friday on Sawbones,

38:50.740 --> 38:52.420
right here on Maximum Fun.

38:54.980 --> 38:56.820
I'm a chronologically-

38:56.820 --> 38:57.320
Fuck.

38:57.320 --> 38:57.820
Nope.

39:01.380 --> 39:03.220
I'm a chronically forgetful gentleman

39:03.220 --> 39:05.460
who constantly loses everyday things,

39:05.460 --> 39:07.860
keys, wallet, phone, et cetera.

39:07.860 --> 39:09.380
After losing my wallet several times,

39:09.380 --> 39:14.100
my aunt bought me one with a chain on it for my birthday.

39:14.100 --> 39:15.220
I found it very convenient.

39:15.220 --> 39:17.300
I don't think you need to read the rest of the question.

39:17.300 --> 39:18.660
First off, I just want to say,

39:18.660 --> 39:20.820
do you know how often you have to lose your wallet

39:20.820 --> 39:22.500
for word to get back to your aunt?

39:24.900 --> 39:25.940
The answer is a lot.

39:27.220 --> 39:30.500
Problem is the fashion statement I'm making with this wallet

39:30.500 --> 39:33.700
is not consistent with my intended persona.

39:33.700 --> 39:36.180
This question asker works in a government office.

39:36.180 --> 39:39.060
He's 27 years old and he just doesn't think it fits with his look.

39:39.060 --> 39:43.380
So he asks, am I good or is the stigma as bad as I fear?

39:43.380 --> 39:46.820
It's from Shackled in Silver Spring, Maryland.

39:48.660 --> 39:51.060
It's the worst you can fear, unfortunately.

39:51.060 --> 39:51.620
Yeah.

39:51.620 --> 39:54.020
I hate to be the bearer of bad news that you already know.

39:55.460 --> 40:00.180
Would it be worse if the wallet was on one of those like

40:00.180 --> 40:02.260
janitor zipline key things?

40:03.460 --> 40:04.500
No, Travis.

40:04.500 --> 40:06.100
That would be fucking awesome.

40:06.100 --> 40:08.580
It's like, this popcorn's going to be $6.50.

40:08.580 --> 40:12.500
And you're like, okay, zip, money, zip zap.

40:12.500 --> 40:14.020
And you just let it go from your hands

40:14.020 --> 40:15.380
and it flies back into your butt.

40:15.380 --> 40:16.180
That's the best.

40:16.180 --> 40:17.300
That would be awesome.

40:17.300 --> 40:18.580
That'd be a pretty dope move.

40:19.220 --> 40:20.500
Here's the thing about it.

40:21.060 --> 40:24.020
As you get older, question asker,

40:24.020 --> 40:27.540
you'll find that things that would be otherwise convenient

40:27.540 --> 40:32.020
or sensible, but aren't fitting,

40:32.020 --> 40:34.020
you have to fight against those because like,

40:34.020 --> 40:37.300
that's how grandpas start wearing glasses

40:37.300 --> 40:38.820
with like the rope tied to them.

40:38.820 --> 40:40.820
Because like, oh, my glasses are always falling off.

40:40.820 --> 40:42.100
I have to have a glasses rope.

40:42.100 --> 40:43.620
Well, no, you don't.

40:44.180 --> 40:47.060
And it's making you look so old right now.

40:47.060 --> 40:49.060
But it's like a weird bell curve.

40:49.060 --> 40:51.140
Because when you're a kid, you're just like,

40:51.140 --> 40:53.380
I'm just going to like Velcro my shoes together.

40:53.380 --> 40:54.740
That's so much easier.

40:54.740 --> 40:56.580
But then like when you're an adult, you can't do it.

40:56.580 --> 40:59.220
But then when you're an old person, bam, back to Velcro.

40:59.220 --> 41:01.540
But it has nothing to do with age.

41:02.340 --> 41:05.380
You can't have a wallet chain and Velcro shoes

41:05.380 --> 41:07.460
when you're head to toe Armani.

41:07.460 --> 41:08.820
What are you fucking talking about?

41:08.820 --> 41:10.980
Imagine an old ass man with like a wallet chain.

41:11.780 --> 41:12.260
Picture it.

41:14.500 --> 41:16.980
I can actually see it in my mind's eye.

41:16.980 --> 41:17.540
It's pretty great.

41:20.340 --> 41:21.300
Oh, you know what'd be great?

41:21.940 --> 41:25.460
You can do what they do at like gas stations and shit

41:25.460 --> 41:27.060
to make sure that people don't steal keys.

41:29.140 --> 41:31.300
Or you attach like a big, like a plank

41:31.300 --> 41:34.420
or like a toilet seat, attach a toilet seat to your wallet.

41:34.420 --> 41:36.260
Put your wallet on like a tire rim.

41:37.700 --> 41:39.780
And then just you have to carry that around with you

41:39.780 --> 41:40.420
all the time.

41:40.420 --> 41:42.020
And people will be like, you have a toilet seat

41:42.020 --> 41:43.620
and a tire rim hanging out of your pants.

41:44.580 --> 41:45.300
I don't know what I do.

41:45.300 --> 41:46.980
I don't think you need them both.

41:48.820 --> 41:51.300
Let's talk about, I have a brief anecdote

41:51.300 --> 41:53.460
about convenience versus perception.

41:53.460 --> 41:53.700
Okay.

41:55.300 --> 41:59.860
My wife discovered a pizza bread in the fridge

41:59.860 --> 42:02.660
and she knew that I got pizza bread for lunch

42:02.660 --> 42:06.420
delivered from Gino's Pub and Family Fun Center.

42:06.420 --> 42:09.860
So she said, did you not eat your pizza bread

42:09.860 --> 42:10.900
that you ordered for lunch?

42:10.900 --> 42:17.060
And I told her what I had done is ordered two of them

42:17.860 --> 42:20.900
because of a lunch concept I call doubles,

42:21.540 --> 42:24.020
where if I get two of something for lunch-

42:24.020 --> 42:26.180
A popular style of playing tennis.

42:27.860 --> 42:29.540
This lunch, in this lunch concept,

42:29.540 --> 42:32.260
if I get doubles of something I'm getting for lunch,

42:32.260 --> 42:34.420
then tomorrow lunch is sorted.

42:34.420 --> 42:35.940
So I don't have to think about it again.

42:35.940 --> 42:39.860
And my wife informed me that this is an unacceptable practice.

42:40.980 --> 42:43.780
I've been doing this for years with dinner

42:43.780 --> 42:45.620
and it is completely fine.

42:45.620 --> 42:47.300
Order two dinners at a restaurant,

42:47.300 --> 42:48.500
box them up, bam, lunch.

42:48.500 --> 42:49.940
I've actually been there when you do that.

42:49.940 --> 42:53.860
And the shame that it brings to my family is crippling.

42:54.580 --> 42:57.620
Justin, can I ask why you have,

42:58.980 --> 43:00.180
if you're going to go to town,

43:00.180 --> 43:01.780
you might as well go into Lincoln.

43:01.780 --> 43:03.940
Why not Monday morning order septuples?

43:06.740 --> 43:09.860
You've envisioned a world in which I, Justin McElroy,

43:10.660 --> 43:12.420
husband of a doctor,

43:12.420 --> 43:14.980
am going to eat seven day old pizza bread.

43:17.620 --> 43:20.580
Or a world where the Gino's cashier answers the phone

43:20.580 --> 43:21.380
and says, what do you need?

43:21.940 --> 43:23.060
Seven pizza breads, huh?

43:23.060 --> 43:23.700
Can't do that.

43:24.580 --> 43:26.900
I can't in good conscience do this for you.

43:26.900 --> 43:28.660
Can't actually add that many up.

43:28.660 --> 43:29.860
Don't know how much it costs.

43:29.860 --> 43:31.300
No one orders that many.

43:31.300 --> 43:34.180
The keys only go up to four on our board.

43:34.180 --> 43:35.140
I don't know what to tell you.

43:35.140 --> 43:37.700
If we try to go above that government regulators swoop in

43:37.700 --> 43:40.740
and say, you are killing this man.

43:41.380 --> 43:43.700
My point is that just because something is a good idea

43:43.700 --> 43:45.940
doesn't mean that it's going to make people around you

43:46.500 --> 43:48.100
think that you're smart.

43:48.100 --> 43:50.820
I mean, you just have to stop losing your wallet.

43:50.820 --> 43:52.180
You know, I lose stuff a lot

43:52.180 --> 43:53.300
because I have a tendency to like,

43:53.300 --> 43:57.540
absentmindedly sit stuff down and then just keep going.

43:57.540 --> 44:00.660
And it's like, I know that I've sat my keys down at some point,

44:00.660 --> 44:01.780
but I can't picture where.

44:01.780 --> 44:05.300
And what I do, and it's not exactly like a very proud moment,

44:05.300 --> 44:06.980
but I'll just loudly announce,

44:06.980 --> 44:09.620
like I'm setting my keys on the dresser

44:10.740 --> 44:12.420
and make it active.

44:12.420 --> 44:16.260
It's pretty dorky, but it works and I don't lose shit anymore.

44:16.260 --> 44:18.100
Do you ever sing a little song?

44:19.540 --> 44:21.860
Dresser keys, dresser keys.

44:22.580 --> 44:24.660
Will you be there when I need?

44:25.940 --> 44:30.260
Putting my wallet on the toilet paper dispenser

44:30.260 --> 44:31.860
in the bathroom.

44:31.860 --> 44:32.980
Gotta do it.

44:32.980 --> 44:33.620
Gotta do it.

44:33.620 --> 44:35.540
What if there's pee on the floor?

44:35.540 --> 44:37.140
It's okay if it gets on my pants.

44:37.140 --> 44:39.140
I'm just wearing these for one day.

44:39.140 --> 44:39.940
But who am I?

44:39.940 --> 44:41.700
Mister buy a new wallet every week

44:41.700 --> 44:43.780
when I get pee on it guy.

44:43.780 --> 44:44.280
No.

44:45.700 --> 44:47.460
Toilet paper wallet.

44:47.460 --> 44:49.540
You're my best friend and I love you.

44:50.580 --> 44:54.420
You know, people say Widow Yankovic has lost his step,

44:54.420 --> 45:02.100
but I think his tunes are as fresh as they were in the 80s.

45:02.100 --> 45:03.380
Is there anything worse than getting

45:03.380 --> 45:04.900
another person's pee on your stuff?

45:07.540 --> 45:08.040
Poop?

45:08.660 --> 45:09.940
Even that seems more...

45:09.940 --> 45:11.380
Anyway, you guys want a Yahoo?

45:12.020 --> 45:12.520
Please.

45:14.020 --> 45:15.700
I got toilet paper wallet stuck in my head.

45:17.060 --> 45:18.340
You jingles are back.

45:19.700 --> 45:22.740
This Yahoo was sent in by Ninja Farmer's Wife.

45:22.740 --> 45:24.500
Thank you, Ninja Farmer's Wife.

45:24.500 --> 45:26.980
It's by Yahoo answers user Cory Lucas who asks,

45:28.180 --> 45:30.820
does dunking at 5'10 attract women?

45:31.940 --> 45:33.860
I can dunk and I'm 5'10.

45:33.860 --> 45:36.100
Will that improve my chances of scoring with a girl?

45:39.940 --> 45:41.380
The funny thing about this,

45:41.380 --> 45:44.660
what it immediately my immediate first impressions

45:45.620 --> 45:48.580
is how funny it is to me that every time we got a question

45:48.580 --> 45:50.820
very early on about like a sports car

45:50.820 --> 45:52.900
and picking up women and stuff like that.

45:52.900 --> 45:55.780
That idea of like there being this one magical thing,

45:55.780 --> 45:57.700
like if I could just, you know,

45:57.700 --> 45:59.620
if I could just play golf better,

45:59.620 --> 46:01.380
if I could just run faster,

46:01.380 --> 46:04.900
but you know, I don't know what women there are

46:04.900 --> 46:07.220
that said they go, oh, that gentleman can dunk.

46:07.220 --> 46:08.740
I definitely want to copulate with him.

46:08.740 --> 46:10.100
And he is not that tall.

46:10.740 --> 46:11.940
That is very impressive.

46:11.940 --> 46:13.700
Compared to other basketball men.

46:14.900 --> 46:17.460
Perhaps they'd make a wonderful partner for sexual Congress.

46:17.460 --> 46:21.860
Yes, why on earth would this woman be watching

46:22.900 --> 46:26.420
amateur dumpsters on her lunch break?

46:26.420 --> 46:30.020
You are going to have to be a pretty smooth operator

46:30.020 --> 46:31.700
to be at a bar and be like,

46:32.500 --> 46:34.260
by the way, I got something special to show you.

46:34.260 --> 46:35.940
Why don't you come with me down to the Y

46:37.140 --> 46:38.340
and I can show you my special skill.

46:38.340 --> 46:41.380
I know the janitor, he'll leave the key under the mat.

46:41.380 --> 46:43.780
I am secretly, I am the janitor

46:44.660 --> 46:46.020
and we're just going to go inside

46:46.020 --> 46:47.620
and I'm going to show you something on the court.

46:47.620 --> 46:48.820
It might take me a few tries.

46:49.860 --> 46:51.380
I'm a wee little man.

46:51.380 --> 46:52.900
It's going to take me a few tries

46:52.900 --> 46:54.820
to build up the courage to jump that high.

46:57.860 --> 46:59.540
Do you think it's more or less impressive

46:59.540 --> 47:00.820
when he just hangs there for a while

47:00.820 --> 47:02.020
because he's afraid to drop down?

47:02.020 --> 47:03.380
Because it's such a long drop.

47:03.380 --> 47:07.140
Imagine this guy who goes through all the trouble

47:07.140 --> 47:10.660
and successfully moves a woman back to the Y with him.

47:10.660 --> 47:11.860
He's like, okay, here we go.

47:11.860 --> 47:16.260
And he jumps too high and goes, oh God, sorry.

47:16.260 --> 47:18.100
This isn't, this never happens.

47:19.860 --> 47:20.900
I always dunk it.

47:22.260 --> 47:24.260
I usually take it to the paint so hard

47:24.260 --> 47:27.060
and I don't get scared like a big guy.

47:27.060 --> 47:27.700
No, I'm serious.

47:27.700 --> 47:30.340
The guys jokingly call me Brian Dunkleman.

47:30.340 --> 47:32.580
That's what they say because I'm so good at dunks.

47:33.380 --> 47:35.940
I am also Brian Dunkleman and the janitor here.

47:35.940 --> 47:43.300
They call me Brian Dunkleman because that's who I am

47:43.300 --> 47:44.420
and that's what I've been doing.

47:45.460 --> 47:48.020
That's the name my parents gave me.

47:49.300 --> 47:50.660
So it's kind of a fun joke.

47:50.660 --> 47:51.620
Like my life.

47:51.620 --> 47:52.820
No, not like my life.

47:54.100 --> 47:55.300
I'm so sad.

47:55.300 --> 47:57.060
Thank you for coming back to the Y with me.

47:57.060 --> 47:58.580
Could you close the door on your way out?

47:59.140 --> 48:00.820
Brian, if you're listening, we're sorry.

48:00.820 --> 48:02.020
It's just a joke.

48:02.020 --> 48:03.380
I'm sure you're doing something.

48:03.380 --> 48:04.500
The first time I read this question,

48:04.500 --> 48:08.340
I thought it was asking if dunking at 5 10 p.m.

48:10.100 --> 48:10.900
Oh man, it works out.

48:10.900 --> 48:11.780
Or 5 10 a.m.

48:11.780 --> 48:12.580
Maybe twice a day.

48:12.580 --> 48:13.140
Works out.

48:13.140 --> 48:14.260
I gotta fucking hurry.

48:15.140 --> 48:18.260
I've got a very narrow window to dunk.

48:19.940 --> 48:21.380
It's like on the equinox.

48:21.380 --> 48:24.420
You can stand an egg on his head at 5 10.

48:24.420 --> 48:27.540
This particular person, the Earth's gravitational pull

48:27.540 --> 48:30.260
has released him enough for him to get ups.

48:30.260 --> 48:35.140
Is it possible that he means that the rim is set at 5 10?

48:36.180 --> 48:38.180
And all he has to do is like lift his feet?

48:39.060 --> 48:41.140
I don't think that's going to be particularly impressive

48:41.140 --> 48:43.460
to a woman or a man or a dog.

48:43.460 --> 48:46.580
Maybe this is a child, like a seven-year-old,

48:46.580 --> 48:47.540
and then it'd be very impressive.

48:47.540 --> 48:50.180
If this is a 5 10 fucking seven-year-old,

48:50.180 --> 48:53.060
everyone get in your cars and drive into the woods,

48:53.060 --> 48:54.260
because that's where you live now.

48:54.260 --> 48:55.620
We have a Titan situation.

48:55.620 --> 48:57.620
Hey, I got another question for you guys.

48:58.740 --> 49:03.220
The question asker asks, I need vices.

49:04.660 --> 49:05.780
I don't like tobacco.

49:05.780 --> 49:07.060
I don't smoke pot.

49:07.060 --> 49:09.540
Due to medical problems, I can't drink alcohol anymore.

49:11.940 --> 49:14.740
I even have a low tolerance for caffeine.

49:14.740 --> 49:16.980
I hate going to parties with other 20-somethings,

49:16.980 --> 49:19.780
because inevitably, I'm the weird guy standing around

49:19.780 --> 49:22.500
drinking water while everyone else has.

49:22.500 --> 49:25.860
I'm the weird guy standing around drinking water

49:25.860 --> 49:26.980
while everyone else has fun.

49:26.980 --> 49:28.500
Any suggestions for stuff to do?

49:29.860 --> 49:32.900
That's from least cool person ever in Corvallis, Oregon.

49:34.180 --> 49:36.260
You could be the guy that takes naps at parties.

49:37.220 --> 49:38.340
That's pretty good advice.

49:38.340 --> 49:41.860
Sloth is a pretty good sin.

49:41.860 --> 49:44.740
If you think about it, smoking pot and drinking alcohol

49:44.740 --> 49:46.980
are really just leading to you getting sleepy

49:46.980 --> 49:48.180
and falling asleep.

49:48.180 --> 49:50.340
So just jump the middleman

49:50.340 --> 49:52.260
and just go straight for the sleepy time.

49:52.260 --> 49:54.500
And then there's also meth.

49:55.220 --> 49:57.060
Wait, hear me out.

49:58.340 --> 49:59.300
Meth?

49:59.300 --> 50:00.340
What about meth light?

50:01.940 --> 50:04.340
Have you tried new meth, crystal meth?

50:10.660 --> 50:15.460
You know, I'm into those e-cigarettes.

50:15.460 --> 50:18.980
It's harmless, it makes everything smell better,

50:18.980 --> 50:22.420
and there's no danger of tobacco.

50:22.420 --> 50:23.220
It's perfect.

50:23.220 --> 50:24.100
That's true.

50:24.100 --> 50:26.180
But you know, there was a foolish time in college

50:26.180 --> 50:29.460
in which I had decided not to drink anymore.

50:30.420 --> 50:32.500
And I understand this problem

50:32.500 --> 50:33.540
because I remember standing there.

50:33.540 --> 50:35.460
I think I was drinking a Gatorade

50:35.460 --> 50:37.380
where like everyone else is getting drunk.

50:37.380 --> 50:39.300
And like the worst afternoon of his life.

50:40.180 --> 50:42.740
You never feel more out of place and like,

50:42.740 --> 50:44.980
I should just go because everyone else

50:44.980 --> 50:47.540
is on a different train than I am.

50:47.540 --> 50:50.740
My train has stopped and is not going anywhere

50:50.740 --> 50:53.860
and everyone else is just powering towards Fun Station.

50:53.860 --> 50:55.540
And Shining Time Station.

50:55.540 --> 50:58.180
Travis's train has been placed outside

50:58.180 --> 51:00.180
a novelty train restaurant

51:00.180 --> 51:01.860
and children are climbing on it.

51:01.860 --> 51:04.340
Here's how I read this sentence.

51:04.340 --> 51:05.140
Due to medical problems,

51:05.140 --> 51:06.420
he can't drink alcohol anymore.

51:06.420 --> 51:07.460
Okay, scratch off the list.

51:08.020 --> 51:09.220
I don't like tobacco.

51:09.220 --> 51:10.340
Fine, scratch off the list.

51:10.340 --> 51:11.380
I don't smoke pot.

51:13.140 --> 51:13.700
You could.

51:13.700 --> 51:18.340
You're just saying that you don't now.

51:19.460 --> 51:21.300
So you're saying the question should read

51:21.300 --> 51:24.340
I don't smoke pot and then parenthetically yet.

51:24.340 --> 51:26.900
Yeah, I'm saying that this that's a thing.

51:26.900 --> 51:27.940
That's one of the things.

51:28.900 --> 51:30.260
Your answer's in the question.

51:30.820 --> 51:31.940
It's right there.

51:31.940 --> 51:33.700
You should probably also stop drinking water.

51:34.500 --> 51:35.460
Drink like a soda.

51:35.460 --> 51:36.820
No, you need to definitely hydrate.

51:36.820 --> 51:39.380
If you're gonna be smoking so much kush,

51:39.380 --> 51:44.260
you need to hydrate because of all the nasty ARB

51:44.260 --> 51:45.620
you're gonna be chiefin.

51:45.620 --> 51:48.100
You gotta fill your lungs with water.

51:48.660 --> 51:50.580
And make sure you have some Skittles on hand.

51:50.580 --> 51:53.300
You gotta Skittle late because you're gonna want this.

51:53.300 --> 51:55.220
You get high enough, you press them together

51:55.220 --> 51:57.380
and you make all sculptures.

51:58.420 --> 52:03.140
I always thought that Munchies was one of those,

52:04.340 --> 52:07.460
a funny thing to say that's not actually accurate.

52:07.460 --> 52:09.060
I have never felt a hunger.

52:09.060 --> 52:10.740
It's a righteous hunger.

52:12.100 --> 52:15.220
The first time that I tried marijuana,

52:16.180 --> 52:19.300
oh God, I wanted to eat everything.

52:19.300 --> 52:20.980
What other drugs have you done, Justin?

52:23.700 --> 52:24.180
Pretty much.

52:25.300 --> 52:26.660
Nani, unless you're listening.

52:26.660 --> 52:27.780
Nani's definitely listening.

52:27.780 --> 52:28.820
Our daddy's listening.

52:28.820 --> 52:31.300
Our daddy knows about our salvia trips.

52:31.300 --> 52:31.860
But that's it.

52:31.860 --> 52:32.420
That's true.

52:32.420 --> 52:33.620
I did shrooms once.

52:33.620 --> 52:36.180
Because at night we cleanin' out our closet.

52:36.180 --> 52:39.540
I did shrooms.

52:39.540 --> 52:41.220
I ate an entire pizza

52:41.220 --> 52:43.060
because the flavor was just so amazing.

52:43.060 --> 52:44.660
You guys are going ride or die.

52:49.700 --> 52:50.900
I'm not going ride or die.

52:50.900 --> 52:52.260
I'm locking my shit up.

52:52.260 --> 52:52.580
Okay, great.

52:52.580 --> 52:53.700
I killed a man once.

52:53.700 --> 52:55.060
We didn't need to end the show,

52:55.060 --> 52:57.060
but I need to share my true shroom story.

52:58.100 --> 52:59.540
Did I ever talk about this in the show?

53:00.260 --> 53:00.900
I don't think I did.

53:00.900 --> 53:02.260
No, I don't think we've ever discussed

53:02.260 --> 53:04.980
our hardcore drug use on the show before, Justin.

53:04.980 --> 53:07.300
Okay, so I tried shrooms.

53:07.300 --> 53:09.140
I probably did too many for my first time.

53:09.140 --> 53:09.700
That's life.

53:10.500 --> 53:14.820
And I'm at a friend's birthday party.

53:14.820 --> 53:16.100
Let me show her my nameless.

53:18.420 --> 53:20.420
We're there for 30 minutes.

53:20.420 --> 53:22.260
And I remember somebody played the,

53:22.260 --> 53:25.220
you know that slow motion Olsen Twins video?

53:25.220 --> 53:26.740
Oh huh, pizza party.

53:26.740 --> 53:27.700
Yeah, pizza party.

53:27.700 --> 53:28.500
So we're watching that.

53:28.500 --> 53:30.260
I'm thinking, man, I'm getting pretty high.

53:30.980 --> 53:34.660
And then my friend's family shows up

53:34.660 --> 53:37.620
to this party, his dad and his brother.

53:37.620 --> 53:39.780
So at that point, I've lost my mind.

53:39.780 --> 53:42.180
Oh God, this is really happening.

53:42.180 --> 53:45.940
And so when I noticed him coming in,

53:45.940 --> 53:48.100
I noticed that his brother is carrying

53:48.740 --> 53:53.220
what appears to be a cake shaped like a giant penis

53:54.100 --> 53:56.820
and a cake shaped like a vagina.

53:56.820 --> 54:01.060
And I thought, oh my God, these drugs

54:01.060 --> 54:02.820
have not only taken hold.

54:02.820 --> 54:05.860
I am like in a full, you know,

54:05.860 --> 54:09.620
I'm in a full Hunter S. Thompson-esque delusion

54:09.620 --> 54:10.260
at this point.

54:10.260 --> 54:12.340
I have lost my grip on reality.

54:13.060 --> 54:17.220
As it happens, when my friend came under

54:17.220 --> 54:19.860
the influence of these hallucinogenics,

54:19.860 --> 54:21.700
he had called his brother and said

54:21.700 --> 54:23.700
that he wanted him to make him a cake shaped

54:23.700 --> 54:26.100
like a penis and another one shaped like a vagina.

54:26.100 --> 54:27.940
And his brother, who is apparently

54:27.940 --> 54:28.980
the best brother in the world,

54:28.980 --> 54:32.980
acquiesced to this request.

54:32.980 --> 54:34.500
And this is a real cake.

54:34.500 --> 54:36.180
And actually the reality of that cake

54:36.180 --> 54:37.860
is something that helped keep me grounded

54:37.860 --> 54:38.900
for the rest of the night.

54:38.900 --> 54:40.660
Because whenever things got too scary,

54:40.660 --> 54:42.660
I would return to the room with a cake shaped

54:42.660 --> 54:45.620
like a penis and remember that I wasn't so far gone.

54:45.620 --> 54:48.420
I wish I had done Shroomstream my dolphin experience.

54:49.620 --> 54:50.820
Can you imagine?

54:50.820 --> 54:52.260
I can't.

54:52.260 --> 54:54.340
It would have been like living a real life

54:54.340 --> 54:55.460
Lisa Frank drawing.

54:55.460 --> 54:59.060
Listen, we've had a lot of fun here today,

54:59.060 --> 55:00.420
but it's time to get serious.

55:01.060 --> 55:01.700
Thank you.

55:01.700 --> 55:03.060
Drugs are bad and you shouldn't.

55:03.060 --> 55:05.060
Well, only do drugs that are natural

55:05.060 --> 55:06.100
out of the ground drugs.

55:06.100 --> 55:07.700
The ones that Jesus made for you.

55:09.380 --> 55:10.500
Thank you so much for listening.

55:10.500 --> 55:11.060
You're the best.

55:11.060 --> 55:12.980
We want to tell you about something really neat.

55:13.940 --> 55:18.580
We have entered into a partnership, a team up.

55:18.580 --> 55:19.140
A collabo.

55:19.700 --> 55:23.060
A collabo with Operation Supply Drop.

55:23.060 --> 55:26.740
So our friend Tristan the Marine is over in Afghanistan

55:26.740 --> 55:30.740
defending our freedom and we want to send him

55:30.740 --> 55:31.380
a little something.

55:31.380 --> 55:34.660
What Operation Supply Drop does is they get collections

55:34.660 --> 55:40.180
of gaming goodness together and they ship them

55:40.180 --> 55:41.540
over to our fighting men and women.

55:42.100 --> 55:44.500
And we're going to do that for Tristan the Marine.

55:45.300 --> 55:48.340
He's over there with some of his buddies

55:49.300 --> 55:51.380
providing intelligence support operations

55:51.380 --> 55:56.180
and it looks like they could use some fun.

55:56.180 --> 55:57.140
They could use some laughs.

55:57.140 --> 55:58.660
So we're going to send them a bunch of video games.

55:59.460 --> 56:02.260
We're raising money and also raising actual games.

56:02.260 --> 56:03.460
We got something lying around the house

56:03.460 --> 56:05.940
you want to donate or you just want to donate some money

56:05.940 --> 56:07.060
or you can't do that.

56:07.060 --> 56:08.180
You just want to spread the word.

56:08.180 --> 56:09.220
Anything would be awesome.

56:09.220 --> 56:11.780
Go to operationsupplydrop.org

56:11.780 --> 56:13.460
and you're going to see Modron Era.

56:13.460 --> 56:15.620
That's the name of our supply drop that we're doing.

56:16.180 --> 56:17.380
We want to make it big.

56:17.380 --> 56:19.060
We want to send them a lot of cool stuff

56:19.060 --> 56:22.660
and we'd love it if you could go and pitch in a few bucks.

56:22.660 --> 56:25.700
It's at operationsupplydrop.org.

56:25.700 --> 56:30.180
His top two requests are for a GameCube for controllers

56:30.180 --> 56:31.700
and a copy of Super Smash Brothers

56:32.260 --> 56:35.300
and Game Boy Advance SPs with Pokemon games

56:35.300 --> 56:36.260
and cables for trading.

56:36.820 --> 56:38.500
How do you know?

56:38.500 --> 56:39.940
Our army rules.

56:39.940 --> 56:41.060
It's the fucking best.

56:41.860 --> 56:43.060
Certainly we could do that.

56:43.060 --> 56:44.980
So please go help them out.

56:44.980 --> 56:47.300
You got till August 11th, but don't hesitate.

56:47.300 --> 56:48.260
Don't wait.

56:48.260 --> 56:48.900
Go now.

56:48.900 --> 56:51.620
Go help them out and help spread the word.

56:51.620 --> 56:53.940
Don't send them regular Game Boy Advances.

56:53.940 --> 56:55.140
Those were terrible.

56:55.860 --> 56:56.900
Give them the SPs.

56:56.900 --> 56:57.380
They need it.

56:57.380 --> 56:57.860
They need them.

56:57.860 --> 56:58.500
They're compact.

56:58.500 --> 56:59.940
They can fit into their fatigues.

57:01.060 --> 57:02.420
They're not going to get any sand in those.

57:02.420 --> 57:03.460
They're not going to get any sand.

57:03.460 --> 57:03.940
They fold up.

57:03.940 --> 57:04.980
They're sand proof.

57:04.980 --> 57:06.260
They can hold them over their heads

57:06.260 --> 57:08.020
when they walk through the sand rivers.

57:08.020 --> 57:10.260
The non-backlit Game Boy Advance.

57:10.260 --> 57:12.660
You can't see that in that hot Afghanistan sign.

57:13.300 --> 57:16.340
They're going to fucking think they're catching a Mewtwo

57:16.340 --> 57:18.660
and it's a dodo.

57:18.660 --> 57:20.340
And they're going to be so disappointed.

57:20.340 --> 57:21.460
And they're not going to be able to go on.

57:21.460 --> 57:23.540
They're not going to have the strength or will to fight.

57:23.540 --> 57:25.060
And then we're going to lose this war.

57:26.420 --> 57:30.260
And it's going to be your fault for sitting on this shitty model

57:30.260 --> 57:32.980
that Nintendo led the Game Boy Advance generation with.

57:32.980 --> 57:35.060
For some reason, I just don't understand it.

57:35.060 --> 57:36.900
Kids don't need to see outside, do they?

57:36.900 --> 57:37.860
Cool, cool.

57:37.860 --> 57:39.060
Just go and launch that product.

57:39.860 --> 57:41.220
Pretty good product, Nintendo.

57:42.100 --> 57:44.740
Thank you to everybody tweeting about the program.

57:44.740 --> 57:48.340
People like Patrick, Doug Piker, Mitch Reeder, Portland Resident,

57:49.540 --> 57:52.660
Sean Melzmer, Kathleen Duffy, Miles Tostel,

57:54.500 --> 57:57.220
Andrew Tennison, Jeff Fowler, Stymie.

57:57.220 --> 57:59.380
Thank you for tweeting about the show.

57:59.380 --> 58:00.580
Please share with a friend.

58:00.580 --> 58:02.180
That's the only way we can grow.

58:04.340 --> 58:07.620
Let me just say really quick that Sega launched the Game Gear

58:07.620 --> 58:09.220
years before the Game Boy Advance

58:09.220 --> 58:12.340
and managed to figure out that people want backlit screens.

58:12.340 --> 58:12.980
Yes, government.

58:12.980 --> 58:16.820
But to be fair, the Game Gear killed its batteries in 2.3 seconds.

58:16.820 --> 58:20.660
Yeah, but it was an illuminated 2.3 seconds.

58:20.660 --> 58:22.340
It was fully colored as well.

58:22.340 --> 58:23.540
And it was beautiful for a second.

58:23.540 --> 58:24.660
And then you blinked and it was gone.

58:25.620 --> 58:26.900
Sorry, what were you going to say, Travis?

58:27.540 --> 58:32.660
I was going to say that you may have noticed that we did not do farm wisdom this week.

58:32.660 --> 58:35.060
And that is because we need your farm wisdom, people.

58:35.940 --> 58:37.460
We can't just make that shit up.

58:38.340 --> 58:40.500
And we also can't just Google it because that's cheating.

58:40.500 --> 58:41.540
Yeah, you got to send it to us.

58:41.540 --> 58:42.980
We want to get it from you.

58:42.980 --> 58:43.780
Farm wisdom.

58:43.780 --> 58:44.820
Send us your questions.

58:44.820 --> 58:50.020
Send anything you want to mbmbam at maximumfun.org.

58:50.660 --> 58:54.180
Speaking of that domain, you can head there to find a bunch of great maximum fun programs.

58:54.180 --> 58:55.300
Stop podcasting yourself.

58:57.620 --> 58:58.820
Gosh, Jordan and Jesse, go.

58:58.820 --> 58:59.780
Judge John Hodgman.

59:01.300 --> 59:03.540
So many wonderful programs that you can enjoy.

59:04.580 --> 59:05.940
They're all waiting there for you.

59:05.940 --> 59:09.220
I got a new medical history program on MaxFun that I do with my wife, Sydney.

59:09.220 --> 59:10.180
It's called Sawbones.

59:10.180 --> 59:11.620
So check that out.

59:11.620 --> 59:13.860
And thank you so much for joining us.

59:13.860 --> 59:16.500
We'll be here with you next Monday, presumably.

59:16.500 --> 59:17.700
Also, thanks to John Roderick.

59:17.700 --> 59:18.660
Did you think John Roderick?

59:19.860 --> 59:20.980
No, I was waiting for you to do it.

59:20.980 --> 59:21.700
Usually you do it.

59:21.700 --> 59:24.580
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song.

59:24.580 --> 59:26.980
It's a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

59:28.340 --> 59:29.380
It's a terrific album.

59:29.380 --> 59:30.580
I've been spinning it a lot.

59:30.580 --> 59:32.100
It's full of a lot of summer hits.

59:32.900 --> 59:36.420
I also want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song.

59:36.420 --> 59:37.220
It's a departure.

59:37.220 --> 59:41.060
It's been, what, like 160 episodes and you've never, like, piped up about it.

59:41.620 --> 59:43.300
You just always say, like, I want to thank you.

59:43.300 --> 59:44.100
You say we.

59:44.100 --> 59:44.420
Right.

59:44.420 --> 59:47.620
I'm just saying I thought after all this time that you were just, like, an ungrateful pig.

59:48.340 --> 59:50.980
No, it's just that, like, I want to say it, but I want to step in your toes.

59:50.980 --> 59:52.500
Griffin, do you have a final question for us?

59:52.500 --> 59:56.420
This final Yahoo answer was sent in by Reedzilla.

59:56.420 --> 59:57.220
Thank you, Reedzilla.

59:57.220 --> 59:59.620
It's by Yahoo Answers user Molly, who asks,

59:59.620 --> 01:00:04.660
What happens at a Paul McCartney concert?

01:00:07.860 --> 01:00:09.060
I'm Justin McElroy.

01:00:09.060 --> 01:00:09.780
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:00:09.780 --> 01:00:11.140
I'm Griffin McElroy.

01:00:11.140 --> 01:00:12.420
It's been my brother, my brother and me.

01:00:12.420 --> 01:00:13.140
Kiss your dad.

01:00:13.140 --> 01:00:29.060
Square on the lips.
