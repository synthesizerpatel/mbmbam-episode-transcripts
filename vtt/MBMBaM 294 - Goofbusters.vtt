00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:49.200
Hello, everyone. It's my brother, my brother, and me, and the time has come.

00:49.760 --> 00:56.000
Time to pay the piper. Time to pay the piper. I'm gonna grab you fucking nerds by your socks,

00:56.000 --> 01:01.440
by your by your your shoe meat. I'm gonna shake you till all your change and dollars fall out.

01:01.440 --> 01:07.360
Get that piper is thirsty, my friend. Oops, your car keys came out too. Looks like I'm gonna have

01:07.360 --> 01:12.960
to sell those for metal scrap. How's your goose been this year? Oh, I've had a fine crop of goofs,

01:12.960 --> 01:18.640
a bumper crop of goofs here at McElroy Farms. We've been giving away for free, but here's the

01:18.640 --> 01:24.880
thing, folks. Now the piper's come and he wants all those pickled peppers of potty humor that you've

01:24.880 --> 01:31.120
been enjoying. He's come, you gotta pay him for them. Do you remember a time when the McElroy's

01:31.120 --> 01:37.280
used to give away their goof crops for free? Pepperidge Farm remembers, and now it's time to

01:37.280 --> 01:44.160
pay. Pepperidge Farm always collects on its debts. I can't hear you guys very well, and I thought

01:44.160 --> 01:50.960
you were saying goose, G-O-O-S-E, and I was like, you should let those around your pickle farm.

01:50.960 --> 01:55.040
They will do a number on your crop. So anyway, it's time to pay the fucking piper.

01:56.240 --> 02:05.200
It's max fun drive weeks, and the fun has stops, and the drive begins. The max is important too,

02:05.200 --> 02:09.280
because we want the maximum amount of the money that you can give us. And a lot of the other

02:09.280 --> 02:15.040
shows on the network won't tow this hard a line. Yeah, yeah. They seem embarrassed about it. We

02:15.040 --> 02:21.840
know what we offer. By my math, we've done about 30 good ones. I think about 30 good.

02:21.840 --> 02:27.920
Statistically, it's pretty good. It's better than most podcasts. And what you don't know is actually

02:27.920 --> 02:35.920
the machine of comedy is lubricated by your money. So lube us up, and let us make you laugh,

02:35.920 --> 02:42.640
so it's all glistening and slippery. We put your money, your cash money and your change money,

02:42.640 --> 02:48.560
into some sort of oil press, and we just squeeze it down. And then I guess all of your finger and

02:48.560 --> 02:53.360
hand juice sort of comes out, and then we just dump that into the mouth of the goof machine.

02:53.360 --> 02:58.720
Correct. And that keeps it going for another year. I'm just going to give you this address

02:58.720 --> 03:05.680
right now. Let's get it up early and often. Maximumfun.org forward slash donate. Go now.

03:05.680 --> 03:09.200
What's that? What is that? And where is it? Where is that? What is it? What are we talking about?

03:09.200 --> 03:14.720
So now the non-goof portion of this. Every year, Max Fun podcasts are delivered to you free of

03:14.720 --> 03:22.160
charge. That's the deal, and that's the way it is now and always shall be. But we do come to you

03:22.160 --> 03:28.000
once a year and say, hey, if you wouldn't mind, if you could, if you got the extra scratch,

03:28.000 --> 03:34.400
if you could kick a little bit of that our way to help support the shows on the network that you

03:34.400 --> 03:39.840
love. We offer great thank you gifts, and it's a way for you to say, hey, I really like this stuff.

03:39.840 --> 03:46.960
This is good stuff. And Maximum Fun is a podcast network that only exists because you like it,

03:46.960 --> 03:52.000
because you like the shows that are on the network, and this is your chance to sort of say, hey,

03:53.200 --> 03:57.600
I cut the cable. I'm just doing this thing now, just doing podcasts.

03:57.600 --> 04:01.840
The Max Fun Drive runs for two weeks. We're going to be talking about it all throughout the episode,

04:01.840 --> 04:05.840
but we're going to do a long one, and we got some special stuff planned. We also got bonus

04:05.840 --> 04:09.360
content. Every show on the network has bonus content. If you become a donor, you get access

04:09.360 --> 04:13.760
to not only this year's crop of bonus content from every show, including this one and the Adventure

04:13.760 --> 04:19.760
Zone and Sawbones and Schmaners and all of them, but also all the bonus content we've ever done

04:19.760 --> 04:24.560
in perpetuity throughout the fullness of time. It's a lot of extra stuff if you're a fan of the

04:24.560 --> 04:30.160
network and you haven't donated before. It's just day one. It's days of stuff. We're going to be

04:30.160 --> 04:33.520
talking about it all throughout. I'll tell you how you can help out. It's maximumfun.org.donate

04:33.520 --> 04:37.920
if you just want to get insight on seeing Ground Floor, get all that bonus content and gifts and

04:37.920 --> 04:42.480
stuff like that. But we'll check back in. And once you do that, feel free to skip these parts

04:42.480 --> 04:46.560
in good conscience, like you've done your duty. But we might say something like,

04:46.560 --> 04:50.880
funny as shit. You don't know. Yeah, it might be like this new hotness.

04:50.880 --> 04:53.680
Like the new thing. Everybody's like, have you heard this new sound?

04:53.680 --> 05:01.280
But here's what we're doing this week. Just to say thank you to everybody that's been on

05:01.280 --> 05:06.240
the My Brother, My Brother and Me bus for the longest time. Do we have a name for this? Back

05:06.240 --> 05:11.600
to Basics? Ground Zero? My Brother, My Brother and Me Ground Zeros?

05:12.320 --> 05:16.640
What do we call them? How about My Bim Bam Zombie Bits? Because these shits are dead for

05:17.280 --> 05:21.600
a good reason. And I don't know if this is like the biblical apocalypse or like some sort of

05:21.600 --> 05:26.640
scientist got buckwild, but they they're back. They've reanimated. Sheech Marin just like looked

05:26.640 --> 05:32.960
out from his his hovel on the dock and saw the Titanic come back and he just called into the

05:32.960 --> 05:37.600
mayor. And now the mayor is calling the Ghostbuster because these bits is back. This is My Brother,

05:37.600 --> 05:44.480
My Brother and Me Goofbusters. Yep. Yeah, there it is. You found it. All right. Goofbusters.

05:44.480 --> 05:48.480
That means we're going to be hitting all your favorite dumb things that we used to do, but

05:48.480 --> 05:54.880
don't. And if we didn't, if we don't get it this time, we're doing another week of this. So I'm

05:54.880 --> 06:00.400
very committed to doing every dumb thing we've ever done again. Wait, we didn't agree on this.

06:00.400 --> 06:04.240
If we're talking about doing a Goofbusters two, then it is going to just like following the

06:04.240 --> 06:10.400
pattern of the film series of Ghostbusters one and two. It is going to experience maybe a let's call

06:10.400 --> 06:16.800
it a 40 percent decrease, a sharp 40 percent decrease in quality. But it might contain some

06:16.800 --> 06:24.800
of the more recognizable characters, whatever our comedy Viggo is, our comedy Peter Scolari.

06:24.800 --> 06:29.280
Not. No, it's Peter McNichol, my dude. McNichol. Damn it. I got my Peters confused.

06:29.280 --> 06:32.800
We're definitely going to Peter McNichol on Goofbusters two, and I'm definitely going to

06:32.800 --> 06:37.520
be controlling him from inside with a big NES arcade controller. That's canon. That's Nick

06:37.520 --> 06:45.680
Cannon. Let's touch down in this pool of jokes. Should we start off with one of these Zombos?

06:45.680 --> 06:52.080
Drop it like it's hot. Griffith, how hot is it? It's pretty hot because it's March and that means,

06:52.080 --> 06:56.720
I mean, I'm in Texas and that means it's hot. Drop it. Drop it then. Put it down.

06:56.720 --> 07:00.880
Okay, I'm trying to put it down. No one's making you hold it, Griffith. You are actively

07:00.880 --> 07:04.960
making me hold it right now. Then put it down and free me from this prison. Travis,

07:04.960 --> 07:08.480
my hands are burning. They're sizzling because of how hot it is and you keep interrupting me

07:08.480 --> 07:12.480
while I'm trying to put it down. Travis, Jesus Christ, please let him put it down. Okay,

07:12.480 --> 07:22.480
please put it down. It's too late. I'm on fire. Breaking news. This one just came over the wire.

07:22.480 --> 07:27.440
I'm so sorry. I know this is inconvenient timing, but we got a haunted doll that has just come in.

07:27.440 --> 07:34.160
This breaking haunted doll watch report is coming to you from eBay. That's the locale on this

07:34.160 --> 07:41.120
particular one. Electronic Bay? The electronic bay washed up on the electronic bay. This dinghy

07:41.120 --> 07:48.560
just washed up on the electronic bay. The whole crew is dead. The whole crew is dead, but Mary

07:48.560 --> 07:54.800
was back and she's a porcelain doll, but here's the thing about haunted doll watch. I let it go

07:54.800 --> 07:59.440
because it seemed like there are a lot of sob stories. I want to introduce you folks to the

07:59.440 --> 08:06.720
fucking most posse haunted doll on the planet. Her name is Mary and this is the literal subject

08:06.720 --> 08:12.080
of her eBay listing. Haunted porcelain doll Mary, beautiful, pure white, light, positive,

08:12.080 --> 08:18.640
energy, light work. So Gmail for that shit. If you're looking for a Christmas gift for me,

08:18.640 --> 08:24.880
it's not too late. What were the SEO tactics on that of a person just like,

08:24.880 --> 08:29.360
somebody's going to be searching eBay for something positive and light and lightly haunted

08:29.360 --> 08:36.720
and porcelain? I can't imagine. Although, I mean, I do want to meet the person that found Mary as their top

08:36.720 --> 08:43.840
search result. Let's get into just like, let's get into her backstory because it's very uplifting

08:43.840 --> 08:50.160
and amazing. Not all of it is because she's a haunted doll, but you know, somewhere I had to

08:50.160 --> 08:55.040
take a turn. Greetings. I'm going to read this as close as I can without punctuation.

08:55.040 --> 09:02.400
Greetings. Today, I like to introduce you to the sweet spirit of Mary. She chose this vessel as a

09:02.400 --> 09:08.400
best represent her in human form. Mary was born in the 1950s and she met her demise in the late 30s.

09:10.640 --> 09:13.760
Um, okay, wait, let's back up.

09:16.720 --> 09:24.000
Hold on. Okay, wait a minute. This is a problem we've reached already. This baby died in 2030.

09:24.000 --> 09:27.600
That's a problem for me. Wait, is it supposed to mean her late 30s?

09:29.120 --> 09:32.960
Yes. Okay, yes. That was actually a misread on my part. Punctuation.

09:34.080 --> 09:41.680
It's important. Mary, burning hell. Mary was born in the 1950s and met her demise in her late 30s

09:41.680 --> 09:48.560
from automobile accidents. Multiple. She... Trying to figure that out. That fucking

09:48.560 --> 09:54.320
transporter. Whoa, I'm flying through the wind. Oh God, it into another wind. Just let me die.

09:54.320 --> 10:00.640
A transporter. Fucking cannonball run bullshit. She remains earthbound and she wasn't ready to

10:00.640 --> 10:06.160
leave yet. She enjoys being around the living. She was a nurse. I mean, which is pretty striking,

10:06.160 --> 10:10.400
especially considering she's someone that was in multiple car wrecks. Yeah, I imagine like meet Joe

10:10.400 --> 10:16.800
Black. It was just like car to car to car ping pong. She was a nurse and never married and she

10:16.800 --> 10:21.600
also practiced white witchcraft for her natural remedies. She brings healing for emotional

10:21.600 --> 10:26.880
support such as grieving, anxiety, and depression. She has high vibrations. It is pure white light.

10:26.880 --> 10:32.320
She has very joyous vibration. I've seen her beautiful lavender orb cascade throughout my home

10:32.320 --> 10:37.440
going from room to room as if it is still doing your job. Oh baby, look, the orb is back.

10:37.440 --> 10:41.600
Wonderful. The lavender orb is back doing its job. Look baby, the orb is lavender today.

10:41.600 --> 10:45.520
Wonder. What a wonderful orb. If you ask me to turn it down, I'm trying to watch Netflix.

10:45.520 --> 10:50.320
I'm watching House of Cards season four. Can you turn the lavender? The lavender is wonderful,

10:50.320 --> 10:54.160
but can you please turn it? I'm getting a lot of glare from her lavender orbs.

10:55.520 --> 11:01.040
If, uh, mainly in the wee hours of the morning. Cool. That's a good time to spot a floating

11:01.040 --> 11:08.160
purple orb. I suppose. Dave, do we have any chocolate chips left? Mary, I'm trying to sleep.

11:08.160 --> 11:12.960
Sorry, Dave. I just need those chocolate chips real bad. You know, you get that late night craving.

11:12.960 --> 11:18.560
Hey Dave, I hate to barge in on you while you're having sex, but I notice you left a

11:18.560 --> 11:22.640
trail of Reese's pieces up to your bedroom. So did you guys want me in on this or?

11:22.640 --> 11:29.840
Okay. We didn't do that. First of all, Mary, we dropped one Reese's piece out there. Uh, okay.

11:30.400 --> 11:36.080
I asked her, okay. She says there's somebody seeking her healing energy and it's time for

11:36.080 --> 11:41.680
her to find a new spirit keeper. She responds strongly to pendulum EMF are outstanding as in

11:41.680 --> 11:47.360
the photos. I asked her to turn on certain lights and she did. She's perfectly harmless,

11:47.360 --> 11:52.320
love children and all great for a first time collector or an avid collector.

11:52.320 --> 11:57.520
She has come through the spirit box with the words of Mary Carr. Hello and healer.

11:57.520 --> 12:00.800
How does she get along with like cats in the house and other dogs?

12:01.520 --> 12:08.240
Uh, well, she's great for kids. If you're looking for a starter, uh, haunted doll to buy for your

12:08.240 --> 12:13.760
children that has a ghost inside of it, it's the Bulbasaur of haunted dolls. Definitely. I, I, um,

12:15.120 --> 12:20.240
this sounds like a pretty good deal. Like it sounds like a sweet roommate, roommate situation

12:20.240 --> 12:25.920
because you get that calming ass energy lavender light. That's so wonderful. But also like, um,

12:25.920 --> 12:29.840
you know, when, when you and the, the, the, your, your spouse are in bed at night,

12:29.840 --> 12:32.640
neither of you wants to get up to, you know, turn the fan on and turn the light off and turn

12:32.640 --> 12:39.200
on the air purifier and turn off the dehumidifier. Um, then, then you got this orb that's just like,

12:39.200 --> 12:43.920
don't worry, I got you click, click, click, click. Do you need anything else? I'll fill the humidifier

12:45.120 --> 12:49.440
with my presence. I love this too, because you don't usually see this in haunted dolls,

12:49.440 --> 12:55.120
but you could get a return on investment. Like she's got marketable skills that you could sell.

12:55.120 --> 13:00.080
Yes. I, I really, I just, I'm almost done with this listing. I just really need to get this,

13:00.080 --> 13:06.560
this last part out. As per eBay rules, I'm selling approximately five inch high. This is the saddest

13:06.560 --> 13:10.880
part of haunted doll watch. This is the new eBay rules. And I think maybe if I, if, if I was looking

13:10.880 --> 13:16.880
for a reason to get out of the game, this is it. eBay now, in addition to your fucking amazing

13:16.880 --> 13:23.440
choice, sweet as hell eBay listing with like ghosts and shit in it, you also had to put in

13:23.440 --> 13:28.560
a boring one for the norms where they're like, here's what I'm actually selling. Okay, fine.

13:28.560 --> 13:33.280
Let's drop the veneer. It would be like, if you went to go see like Evita and she's standing on

13:33.280 --> 13:40.080
the balcony and she's like, also, I'm an actress. There's no, there's no, it's just a fake balcony.

13:40.080 --> 13:43.920
There's a ladder behind me. But do if you want to, because I'm trying to elicit an emotional

13:43.920 --> 13:48.640
response. I like in Zootopia at the end when you're like you and your kids are having a good

13:48.640 --> 13:53.920
cry because it's a film for both parents and children. And by Zootopia, I definitely meant

13:53.920 --> 13:58.640
coming through Panda three, it zooms out and you see the animators and they're like, we got you. And

13:58.640 --> 14:03.920
then they wink, cut to credits. As for eBay rules, I'm selling at approximately five inch high

14:03.920 --> 14:09.040
porcelain doll with some wear due to age. She will come with a cute little broom and one that I

14:09.040 --> 14:16.960
handcrafted myself, especially for her and a small shoe in which to hold them. Just one? No, it's a

14:16.960 --> 14:23.600
shoe in which to hold the broom and wand she made for her. That's where they go. Yes. Yes. She comes

14:23.600 --> 14:29.120
with all her accessories. Absolutely. That's where a broom is. A shoe and a wand and a broom to go

14:29.120 --> 14:33.680
in the show. Yeah. Which hold them. She will also come with her story handwritten, a simple ritual

14:33.680 --> 14:38.480
for communication and a free gift. Oh, you almost made it. You almost made it in there, but you did

14:38.480 --> 14:43.760
say a simple ritual for communication with the doll, which I cannot imagine is within the purview

14:43.760 --> 14:52.880
of some kind of like moderator at eBay. I don't know. I'm going to have to ask Dave. It is a ritual.

14:52.880 --> 14:58.160
I mean, it does come with a ritual for communication. I'm going to have to take this up the ladder.

15:00.240 --> 15:05.280
It says eBay forbids the sell of intangible item. Therefore, any experience that may occur

15:05.280 --> 15:12.000
is simply free gift to you. So like, is that what you meant by free gift? I was hoping for like rope

15:12.000 --> 15:17.200
or like an air freshener or something. Or a second shoe. So I can have one for the wand and one for

15:17.200 --> 15:23.600
the brew. It comes with a shoe and a bonus shoe. So I didn't have to double up all my storage.

15:25.200 --> 15:30.160
Why did we ever start doing a doll haunt? Juice, what's the current bid at? You can buy this for

15:30.160 --> 15:35.760
$35 right now. Buy now. What? I've got $35? I was going to use that to donate to Maximum Fund,

15:35.760 --> 15:40.080
but instead. No, let's go. I'm psyched for Max Fund Drive. I think it's a great cause. I love

15:40.080 --> 15:43.920
being a part of this network. This is a better thing to spend the $35 on. Because I could make

15:43.920 --> 15:50.400
money selling her healing services. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. The buy it now price is actually $33.75.

15:50.400 --> 15:55.600
What a deal! An even better bargain. Absolutely. I just carved off a $1.25 for you.

15:56.880 --> 16:01.280
Should we do another Zombo bid or a Yahoo? Let's do a question. All right, yeah. Second

16:01.280 --> 16:08.000
actual question. Hit me. My brothers, I lit, this is actually hey brothers. There's a young man on

16:08.000 --> 16:14.880
my bus wearing a top hat. He is dressed casually otherwise. Why is he doing this? What should I do

16:14.880 --> 16:20.720
in this situation? That's for Matt. I originally, I just read it and I thought the last question

16:20.720 --> 16:25.760
was why should I be in this situation? Why should I? Matt, this how you do me God? God,

16:25.760 --> 16:30.400
this how you do me. Why should I be in this situation? Matt, first stay calm. You're going

16:30.400 --> 16:37.120
to get through this. Yeah. We've all been there. There's so many variables that we don't know.

16:37.120 --> 16:41.360
So I guess let's start with a broad net and then we'll tighten up that net by grabbing the corner

16:41.360 --> 16:46.800
ropes of it and just like sort of squinching them together. Normal net procedure. All right,

16:46.800 --> 16:53.520
who wears a top hat? Magicians, yes. Old timey men, yes. Oil barons, carpet baggers. Dead, dead.

16:54.480 --> 16:59.920
Oil barons, I don't think wear them anymore. The undertaker in Mad Dog McCree. Yes. Dead.

17:01.040 --> 17:06.960
Abraham Lincoln. Dead. Dead, okay. A lot of people who wear top hats are dead.

17:06.960 --> 17:12.480
I'm learning now. Wait, what about the carriage driver ghost from Scrooge? You said ghost in the

17:12.480 --> 17:18.320
fucking- What about the carriage driver of the ghost tours in Savannah? Good call. Where they

17:18.320 --> 17:24.720
share where the ghosts are. I think they wear top hats. The host guy at Jacqueline Hyde Club in New

17:24.720 --> 17:29.600
York. Okay, but I'm discounting both of those. It could be a carriage driver, it could be somebody

17:29.600 --> 17:33.920
working at Jacqueline Hyde, except that they would either be completely in plain clothes

17:33.920 --> 17:38.480
because they ended their fucking shift and they don't want to dress up like they're- They're

17:38.480 --> 17:45.040
like, listen, Brian, you do a great job here at Jacqueline Hyde Club. We really appreciate you

17:45.040 --> 17:51.360
very much. Your top hat stinks. It smells so fucking bad and you've got to take it home and

17:51.360 --> 17:55.680
launder it. You know we launder the rest of your uniform for you. Your hat smells like fucking

17:55.680 --> 18:00.640
head dookie and I hate it and I please would go home and wash it off. He's got a week old sandwich

18:00.640 --> 18:04.960
underneath it. Hey, Brian, there's moss on your hat and I hate it. Yeah, you don't even need a

18:04.960 --> 18:10.000
sandwich up in there. I remember distinctly. I'm getting- Oh man, I'm getting like nightmare

18:10.000 --> 18:14.640
flashbacks right now in this waking moment that's giving me very strong anxiety. Remembering back

18:14.640 --> 18:18.640
when we used to do Huntington Outdoor Theater in the middle of summer at an outdoor amphitheater

18:18.640 --> 18:23.680
and we would do shit like fucking Hello Dolly and these period pieces where men would wear hats

18:23.680 --> 18:29.040
and just kind of sweat their stink up into them. Just sort of vent up into the the velvety fabric

18:29.040 --> 18:32.960
and then would take them off backstage and you would see a slimer come out of it each time.

18:35.520 --> 18:40.640
Yeah, then they do shows like Beauty and the Beast at the outdoor theater. Oh, you're just

18:40.640 --> 18:46.640
asking- Just trying to kill people. Yeah. Tragedy struck this time again, predictably.

18:46.640 --> 18:55.440
We're on our sixth beast. Yeah, they just keep dying. So maybe this is a hat prank

18:55.440 --> 19:01.520
whereas they got it glued onto them and they can't take it off or maybe it's like an alien

19:01.520 --> 19:06.160
that saw a human wearing a top hat and morphed into them but that's like part of their physiological

19:06.160 --> 19:10.720
form now and they can't take it off because it's part of the replicant. Maybe it is an alien but

19:10.720 --> 19:15.680
more like a morgue style and he saw a picture of Abraham Lincoln. It was like the first thing

19:15.680 --> 19:20.640
he imprinted on here on earth and he just like wears them because he thinks that that's what

19:20.640 --> 19:29.520
earth men do. Oh, it also depends to me what city you're in on the bus because like there

19:29.520 --> 19:35.280
are certain cities that if you said I'm in Portland I'd be like oh okay but if you were like

19:35.280 --> 19:44.160
I'm in Atlanta I would be surprised. Well, okay. That's nothing against Atlanta, just doesn't seem

19:44.160 --> 19:49.680
like a top hat city to me. If you're talking about a city where a PAX is held and it's on the weekend

19:49.680 --> 19:55.440
of a PAX then it makes perfect sense. I believe it. Maybe just I hate to keep digging into this

19:55.440 --> 19:59.360
fucking alien well but it could be a cone head that's embarrassed about the shape of their dome.

19:59.360 --> 20:05.040
Could it be that the alien is the hat and the hat has like landed on top of a human's head

20:05.040 --> 20:10.720
and begun controlling the human and you have to save that human by knocking the hat off of his

20:10.720 --> 20:16.240
head? Yeah. Is it possible? Hold on. No, no, no. We should be explicitly clear. No matter what,

20:16.240 --> 20:20.080
we figure out what the situation is or what we tell you to do. Walking up to this stranger on

20:20.080 --> 20:24.960
the bus and knocking the hat off their head is absolutely the most important thing you can do

20:24.960 --> 20:31.840
right now. This is objective number one, agent. This is your mission. Should you choose to accept

20:31.840 --> 20:36.400
it? Just kidding, you have to. Go knock that hat off. And if he starts getting upset shake him and

20:36.400 --> 20:41.760
say I freed you. You're free. Snap out of it. I saved you from the Zebulatroid. Snap out of it.

20:41.760 --> 20:48.560
Uh, okay, what are some dope things you can say to someone before you knock the top hat off?

20:48.560 --> 20:54.400
I'll start. Hat's off to ya. Okay, that's pretty good. How about this? Let me guess. Ferguson and

20:54.400 --> 20:59.120
then they say no and as they're saying no you smack the hat off their head. Okay, but that sounds

20:59.120 --> 21:04.000
like bullying. I just want to say because Travis and I are doing some like fucking independent

21:04.000 --> 21:08.720
say welcome to Earth shit and it sounds like you might just be cyber bullying but in the meat space

21:08.720 --> 21:14.720
realm. He needs it. I mean he needs it. I know. You're meat bullying Justin. That's not what we do

21:14.720 --> 21:18.960
here. We don't meat bully. How about Abraham stinking and you knock it off his head? Okay,

21:18.960 --> 21:23.680
no. Okay, so I have two meat bulliers on the show now. If you're giving someone bullying that they

21:23.680 --> 21:29.280
richly deserve and need that is called parenting. It's very different. It's a different idea. No,

21:29.280 --> 21:34.080
I'm saying. Oh, I've got it Griffin. How about this? Compromise. You knock the hat off his head

21:34.080 --> 21:40.960
and then you say the magic was in you all along. Okay. Okay, knock that off your head and say

21:40.960 --> 21:45.280
see you were beautiful without it the whole time. You don't need the hat to be special.

21:45.280 --> 21:52.160
Knock the hat off and pretend it's like the like you just took the secretly attractive woman's

21:52.160 --> 21:58.720
glasses off in any movie ever made. It's like the hat is his scrunchie and paint stained overalls.

21:58.720 --> 22:04.720
Now wait. Exactly. Wait a minute. You lift up the hat. He like shakes it out. Just a beautiful

22:04.720 --> 22:12.880
cascades to his shoulders. There he goes starring dude Rachel Lee Cook. I'm gonna fuck that top hat.

22:12.880 --> 22:19.520
I'm gonna go fuck that Ferguson. Turn him into the prom king. Just watch me do it. No way man.

22:19.520 --> 22:24.320
With that hat. No way. I'll go. Bro, you'll never be able to fuck him. Get him to be the prom king.

22:24.320 --> 22:28.880
You want to bet my Ferrari? Okay. I bet my virginity. Wow. There's a lot of really

22:28.880 --> 22:37.520
super sexual stuff going on right now. There he goes. A psychosexual top hat rock from Lionsgate.

22:37.520 --> 22:42.480
Not another one. We've already released six of those this summer. Bring your family for a

22:42.480 --> 22:49.840
heartwarming tale of meat bullying and jock fucking. This this month in mad magazine there

22:49.840 --> 22:56.080
he went. A parody of all the hilarious top hat psychosexual big adventures that have been

22:56.080 --> 23:02.640
happening in theaters lately. What me worry? Presented by the Wayans brothers. Top scat.

23:03.520 --> 23:07.760
Okay we just we just confused three different parody things. Yeah we sure did. We sure did.

23:07.760 --> 23:11.760
We definitely did. We should hold that art form in higher regard. Uh Griffin do you how about

23:11.760 --> 23:16.400
another yahoo? Yeah sure or fuck or fuck off. How about this instead because it's March and we need

23:16.400 --> 23:22.160
to fucking get ahead of some stuff. We got to get ahead of some stuff with some monthly observances

23:22.160 --> 23:25.920
because we've been slightly we've been sleeping on it for a long long time. Well here's the thing

23:25.920 --> 23:32.080
they don't invent new months. Like once you do 12 of them you ran through the set. But they do invent

23:32.080 --> 23:39.600
new bullshit for them months don't they? Like every time. I'm talking about stuff like humorists are

23:39.600 --> 23:47.360
artists month in March. Thank you for this. Thank you. Thanks for the recognition finally. I'm sick

23:47.360 --> 23:52.320
of running up against that wall. Yeah I know. Adopt a rescued guinea pig month. Stop buying them

23:52.320 --> 23:59.040
at the at the guinea pig box stores. No son of mine will ever be a humorist or a guinea pig.

23:59.920 --> 24:06.560
That's not what that one is about I don't think. What's it about? Um how about play the recorder

24:06.560 --> 24:16.080
month. Hey do it. Do this. Hey do this thing. Hey I'm not who am I I'm not your music teacher

24:16.080 --> 24:22.080
but go do this. Hey dad can I have that new bicycle I've been dreaming about? I'm sorry son

24:22.080 --> 24:26.400
things down at the recorder plant have been going real slow lately. People just don't want to play

24:26.400 --> 24:31.920
them like they used to. Um how about if you were older than 13 and you buy a recorder you should

24:31.920 --> 24:37.600
be arrested. Yeah it should be illegal to buy them if you're older than 13. That's some pied

24:37.600 --> 24:41.920
piper bullshit. That's pied piper bullshit is what it is. There's only one piper and that's

24:41.920 --> 24:50.240
the max fun piper. Um I I this one's important to me workplace eye wellness month. What? I workplace

24:50.240 --> 24:55.120
eye wellness month you gotta be on constant fucking vigilant lookout for things that are

24:55.120 --> 25:01.120
gonna come directly for your eyes while you're working at the workplace. Like staples? Staples

25:01.120 --> 25:06.560
who knows? You know like that that kidder that kidder Evan who's always like pretending to fire

25:06.560 --> 25:10.720
staples at you from the stapler. You get one of those you meet the business into one of those

25:10.720 --> 25:16.960
little little paper paper huggers and you're done. You're done. Cut it out Evan. I mean it's important

25:16.960 --> 25:20.240
too about all these glare from the screens. I don't have any science on it but I bet it's

25:20.240 --> 25:23.440
probably not good for you that's why Justin wears those nerdy ass Gunnars all the time.

25:23.440 --> 25:27.760
I just put a little blue gel over mine. I mean I can call them nerdy ass Gunnars because they are

25:27.760 --> 25:31.200
they're gaming glasses that you wear but and I'm gonna be laughing to you until I can't fucking

25:31.200 --> 25:36.560
see you anymore in like 15 years. Uh I actually don't. I just so you know I gotta have the

25:36.560 --> 25:41.600
Gunnars biz. I found a place on Amazon that sells them it's like similar things for 15 bucks. Oh

25:41.600 --> 25:46.080
dash. Much more stylish so like I'll get you up on it. Okay cool. Do they still like look like

25:46.080 --> 25:52.240
you're about to go fucking paintballing? No they look like they look like they're actually in a way

25:52.240 --> 25:57.200
worse because they look like you need glasses. Oh good. I don't yeah so it's like I don't so it

25:57.200 --> 26:02.480
feels a little funny. Um man I don't know why we I can't I don't know why we stopped doing these.

26:03.120 --> 26:07.440
It's so good. It's so funny. How does this bit usually work? Remind me Griffin. We usually

26:07.440 --> 26:10.960
settle on one. What's the good like what's the funny thing about this? We settle on one and then

26:10.960 --> 26:18.000
we come up with slogans for it. We do PSAs. Oh okay. National on hold month. What? Wait hold on.

26:18.560 --> 26:25.600
Quinoa month. Get crazy. I do like that because for a long time I said quinoa. You didn't. I did.

26:25.600 --> 26:32.560
No you didn't. Until uh this year. No. So it would be great if we had a month to bring that up. Okay

26:32.560 --> 26:37.040
then Travis why don't you sort of take the fucking lead on quinoa month and try Justin I'll support

26:37.040 --> 26:41.360
you as much as we possibly can but I do want to keep like a distance from you. Okay yeah I'll

26:41.360 --> 26:46.720
here I'll start. It's not quinoa. Yeah it's not that. Go ahead Travis. How about this um why is

26:46.720 --> 26:52.080
it spelled that way? We might never know but for some reason it's quinoa. National quinoa month.

26:52.080 --> 26:55.760
Hey let me try one. Hey I know they call them ancient grains but you can still eat them.

26:55.760 --> 27:02.000
They're not expired. They're not expired. Quinoa month. These grains belong in a museum.

27:02.000 --> 27:09.920
Quinoa month. Rice is for real turkeys. Okay how about quinoa month. These these ancient grains

27:09.920 --> 27:18.400
are fit for a quinoa month. Cracklin O'Brien is for babies. Get in this good shit. Quinoa month.

27:18.400 --> 27:23.280
If you don't like the taste you can put some cranberries in there you goof. Check out this

27:23.280 --> 27:31.200
fat sand. Oh what about just like a picture of whatever a grain of quinoa looks like with like

27:31.200 --> 27:39.520
sunglasses and it's arms crossed and the caption is keen like k-e-e-n wow. Yeah wow but yeah so

27:39.520 --> 27:43.680
kind of like a buzz but why is there a whatsapp thing? Well I was thinking more like pepsi man.

27:43.680 --> 27:50.480
Okay that's some quinoa. How about this one um rumors that quinoa is just what is inside of

27:50.480 --> 27:55.520
beanbag chairs is false. This message is brought to you by the quinoa council on this most sacred

27:55.520 --> 28:00.800
month. Quinoa there's like a two percent chance they'll give you superpowers we don't know yet.

We made it wrong it's so too long and stringy that whole dirt. This little spaghetti dots.

28:43.840 --> 28:53.520
Quinoa month is like flavorless non-frozen dipping dots but cook them oh god but ice cream of the

28:53.520 --> 29:03.440
past. Quinoa month you gotta cook these things. Quinoa month you live 30 years without it don't

29:03.440 --> 29:13.040
waste any more time. That one's for me only. Oh god speaking of it being too long I would like

29:13.040 --> 29:16.320
to talk to you about maximumfun.org. Abraham Lincoln never ate quinoa that's something you

29:16.320 --> 29:21.760

Well how about I start and then you pick up the ball and you run it into the end zone.

29:55.680 --> 30:01.040
Okay that's a that would be a fumble recovery and I then we'd be on opposite teams I think.

30:01.040 --> 30:06.880

33:29.760 --> 33:35.600
actually wrote a little a kind of a little story to kind of help illuminate why i think people

33:35.600 --> 33:40.400
should donate to maximum fun i hate what to say i hate what this is and the story goes a little

33:40.400 --> 33:44.480
something i got these hairs on the back of my neck they've been standing up since we started

33:44.480 --> 33:49.760
this fucking project once long ago it was coming let's get it over with once long ago on the moist

33:49.760 --> 33:54.400
planet known as lacrosse it's always moist voices and every fucking one hey gang like now i'm mad

33:54.400 --> 33:59.120
at you the listeners who are first of all like supporting this type of behavior don't sit in

33:59.120 --> 34:06.480
moist we've done moist before there was an alien known as ravioli every night ravioli would eat a

34:06.480 --> 34:12.000
churro drink some banana peppies and dream of sharing a catawampus with his thunderful friends

34:12.000 --> 34:16.880
but you see ravioli had no thunderful friends because his planet was magnetic magnanimous

34:16.880 --> 34:22.960
and empty then one day he tuned his proboscis to the northeast and picked up picked up a craggy

34:22.960 --> 34:29.040
signal poppycock exclaimed ravioli excitedly friends he listened and heard stop podcasting

34:29.040 --> 34:34.720
yourself he heard fleshy fun called jordan jesse go he enjoyed the donkey squeegees of throwing

34:34.720 --> 34:40.960
shade he laughed himself silly at the dog football of mbmb am he instantly loved this malarkey

34:40.960 --> 34:45.840
although he couldn't talk back to his new friends this network of maximum fun made him feel like he

34:45.840 --> 34:52.080
was a part of something masticated then he heard something fantastical holy chalupas he cried he

34:52.080 --> 34:57.520

37:13.360 --> 37:18.880
the children on an information hunt activity sounds like a cool birthday party whoa dad or mom

um yeah my my son's a real dip shit real nerd oh uh it's real dingleberry and i kind of hate his

37:27.120 --> 37:31.760
guts uh apart from sending children on an information hunt type activity it would be

37:31.760 --> 37:36.320
nice to have a few themed games that doesn't involve just sitting around the computer love

37:36.320 --> 37:42.320
google love google love if i could just say like you probably shouldn't have any games that involve

37:42.320 --> 37:48.080
sitting around the computer that's not actually a party technically yeah um love google though

37:48.080 --> 37:56.880

38:41.840 --> 38:46.960
a petting zoo with elon musk in it he's not a google boy is he never mind bad idea canceled

38:46.960 --> 38:52.640
griffin what kind of things do people use google for let's start there like let's not just first

38:52.640 --> 38:58.960
thought this let's a to c this shit yeah what do you use google for maybe it's google maps maybe

38:58.960 --> 39:05.440
it's google docs maybe it's google docs maybe it's google docs maybe it's google nip slips google

39:05.440 --> 39:12.960
nip slips new from google all the nip slips all in one place jeffrey rush nip slip let's be honest

39:12.960 --> 39:20.080
that's basically google images like i don't want to cast this version i guess that's true um i got

39:20.080 --> 39:27.760
some results for jeffrey rush nip slip did you i'm seeing them i'm looking at them enjoying them i'm

39:27.760 --> 39:34.400
enjoying them and loving them he did good stuff anyway um oh i'm gonna get rid of that image

39:34.400 --> 39:41.840
thanks uh always be on that watch list google google birthday information gathering high i

39:41.840 --> 39:45.920
think is fun maybe he's talking about some private detective shit like hey i think the

39:45.920 --> 39:51.360
terence is still my fucking lawnmower go get over there see what you can do all kids love being

39:51.360 --> 39:56.720
privatized what's your piece of shit dad up to your mouth let's find out kids you know the irony

39:56.720 --> 40:01.360
here is that this dad could figure this out just by googling how to throw a google themed birthday

40:01.360 --> 40:07.680
party but the sheer jealousy he feels with his insidious geek son's love of google versus his own

40:07.680 --> 40:12.160
he's too proud his own hubris stops him from solving this problem well fucking google's got

40:12.160 --> 40:17.680
that gobot now right that can be a chinese board game that is a billion years old that nobody's

40:17.680 --> 40:20.960
ever been able to master and they just like program that i don't see why they can't program

40:20.960 --> 40:26.480
this this kid like a better dad or mom like happy birthday i've been replaced by i'm gonna go like

40:26.480 --> 40:29.600
kick it and they're probably psyched about it because they hate their nerd son so much because

40:29.600 --> 40:33.200
they're a piece of shit right the parent not the nerd they just need like a break they just need

40:33.200 --> 40:37.520
like one second to themselves they just need like a minute to themselves just one day to not think

40:37.520 --> 40:44.480
about google yeah you can just stop talking about google we get it you love google what about my

40:44.480 --> 40:51.040
needs if you guys could um if i can make one different google like if i can make one change to

40:51.040 --> 40:56.400
google or like an alternate google yeah my alternate google would be a google that did not

40:56.400 --> 41:01.280
return picture uh like every time i search for an actress for more information about her it did not

41:01.280 --> 41:06.320
return search results about her feet yeah every single time literally autocomplete with like more

41:06.320 --> 41:10.000
information about her feet like every single let me actually that would be my dream google i'm on

41:10.000 --> 41:14.880
google.com i've typed in jeffrey rush's name and that's a tough one to think about how to spell

41:14.880 --> 41:19.920
jeffrey it's because it's not it's all wrong uh the top result it says right here is jeffrey rush

41:19.920 --> 41:25.120
nip slips so like again like the standards are disgusting you might have some search history

41:25.120 --> 41:30.800
there what if what if we invented a program an app for google called like google buddy and it was

41:30.800 --> 41:36.080
just like a program that you typed it in and before anything came up google buddy came up like hey do

41:36.080 --> 41:40.800
you want this to not be weird do you want me to like sort through this for you and then we could

41:40.800 --> 41:48.160
come up with a fucking dark timeline bad google called boogle and boogle is just gonna be you turn

41:48.160 --> 41:52.160
it you turn on your computer and you open up it'll have its own web browser at that point it's not

41:52.160 --> 41:57.040
even google chrome anymore there's just a boogle web browser and you just click it and just a random

41:57.040 --> 42:02.400
pick of feet come up because it's just like we cut out the middle man no boogle no boogle get

42:02.400 --> 42:07.840
the fuck out of here buddy i can't he tied me up in the other browser are you sure it's jeffrey rush

42:07.840 --> 42:15.280
he's got lots of crazy warts on there no i'm good you gotta see what he's been walking on griffin

42:15.280 --> 42:22.320
i don't well i do actually i'm kind of curious it's not what you think would you like to see

42:22.320 --> 42:31.920

42:42.800 --> 42:49.200

42:49.200 --> 42:53.600
i would like to invest 10 million dollars into you i'm elon musk i see a lot of promise here

42:53.600 --> 42:59.040
i love jeffrey rush's feet welcome to elon musk's special mars dome we only have one

42:59.040 --> 43:06.560
search engine here it's google it's kind of like the wild west how about a question yes absolutely

43:06.560 --> 43:11.280
you want a regular one yes the one that we built i would like you to read it at the end of each work

43:11.280 --> 43:16.480
day my husband and i arrive at the entrance of our apartment complex to check our mailbox before

43:16.480 --> 43:24.320
heading in for the past three weeks like clockwork a white haired elderly gentleman around the age of

43:24.320 --> 43:34.720
75 to 80 exits the mailroom and literally now and literally walks backwards towards his own

43:34.720 --> 43:41.600
apartment a good five to seven minute this is going to be a great opportunity for us to talk

43:41.600 --> 43:45.680
about one of our favorite just sort of running bits which is a ghost themed thing because there's

43:45.680 --> 43:49.600
a ghost he's a ghost man and this is a ghost and you got a ghost in your spot it's a very

43:49.600 --> 43:55.440
surreal thing to watch thank you question asker thanks for those important details he almost

43:55.440 --> 44:00.640
always has a grimace in his face and worse he stares right at us while he's doing it now can't

44:01.520 --> 44:06.880
uh we've been trying to figure out why you would do this he's a bad ghost is this a new exercise

44:06.880 --> 44:12.720
for the elderly are we in an episode of twin peaks and most of all why in god's name must he

44:12.720 --> 44:17.360
stare at us while he does it is it any chance you might be able to shed some light on this we would

44:17.360 --> 44:22.720
love to hear uh your own thoughts and conclusions on the matter that's from alexis i think i think

44:22.720 --> 44:29.280
you need to shed some fucking proton light on him i think busting i think it's time for you to feel

44:29.280 --> 44:34.960
good he's not being threatening in any way oh you sure because he's walking backwards and mean

44:34.960 --> 44:38.720
mugging these two well he's walking backwards five to seven minutes because he wants you to

44:38.720 --> 44:44.720
free him from this eternal pain oh it's a misha barton ghost not a slimer yeah it's one it's

44:44.720 --> 44:48.640
always one of those two yeah you're either dealing with a barton or a slimer although she

44:48.640 --> 44:54.080
does barf all over herself and that's kind of slimy you gotta protect you gotta protect this

44:54.080 --> 44:59.440
old man one from other busters because they don't understand busters just don't understand

44:59.440 --> 45:03.760
and two you gotta find a way to free him maybe there's a piece of mail he never collected

45:03.760 --> 45:08.400
that and you need to like break into his mailbox and get the mail for him so he can finally be

45:08.400 --> 45:14.640
freed from this pain prison maybe he woefully misunderstood that one scene where people started

45:14.640 --> 45:19.440
running alongside forrest gump because he was so inspirational maybe he thinks that he's gonna get

45:19.440 --> 45:26.400
one going now and it's just you walking next to him backwards like what is gonna what is gonna like

45:26.400 --> 45:32.320
curtail this behavior faster than you joining this man on his like leisurely backward stroll

45:32.880 --> 45:36.960
maybe he completely misunderstood the scene from ferris bueller and he's trying to roll the miles

45:36.960 --> 45:43.600
back by walking backwards no this is the saddest this is the saddest possibility is that he thinks

45:43.600 --> 45:49.920
he will unate he will binge him and button himself by rolling back the old ageometer on his tipper

45:49.920 --> 45:57.280
i think he's probably just like the greatest old man effort he's like i hey i gotta fucking i only

45:57.280 --> 46:01.360
got a few years left let's do this shit let's freak out let's get it yeah let's get it wet i'm

way to do it but it's not possible because the bit i want to bring back it's hard to fit into

47:22.160 --> 47:27.440

47:27.440 --> 47:32.080

49:01.680 --> 49:04.720
this one is important because it's also sort of tapping into one of our sort of key

49:05.600 --> 49:13.520
interest areas uh make sure your horse doesn't eat too fast scouring it scouring again keep in

49:13.520 --> 49:19.600
mind this book was written in like 1815 um but it still holds true today uh scouring is caused by

49:19.600 --> 49:24.960
too rapid eating which can be prevented by putting half a dozen pebbles the size of the fist into the

49:24.960 --> 49:32.960
manger with the oats oh meatballs that sounds like a good way to get pebbles in your horse's tummy

49:32.960 --> 49:36.480
well no it's the size of the fist so like they're gonna taste that rock and be like nope that's a

49:36.480 --> 49:41.840
rock let me just put that to the side um according to farmer modern farmers some commentary on this

49:41.840 --> 49:48.080
old ass book said horses in 2014 still need some help taking it nice and slow when they eat like

49:48.080 --> 49:55.360
of course they do like guys we gotta get it together we talked about this last week we got

49:55.360 --> 50:02.240
to eat slower we're scouring our bellies it's bad bad stuff um uh and rocks in the feed trough are

50:02.240 --> 50:08.400
still a simple way to keep them on pace we still we still do that says pete burkholder a large animal

50:08.400 --> 50:12.320
veterinarian based now wait i want you to read that again girlfriend but do it with a really posh

50:12.320 --> 50:18.880
british accent oh we still do that said pete burkholder a large animal veterinarian based

50:18.880 --> 50:25.440
in dayton virginia that's a standards recommendation you sound like tim curry

50:26.160 --> 50:32.320
so do you do we are we saying we put rocks in the fuck yeah dudes think there will be food spice them

50:32.320 --> 50:40.400
up no i think they say they mix the pebbles into the not just like oops all pebbles yeah i don't

50:40.400 --> 50:46.240
prefer this i would prefer just more oats back thanks they learned to eat slower here's a you've

50:46.240 --> 50:51.120
done you did really good out on the track today here's a sugar cube and a pebble i put it on top

50:51.120 --> 50:55.920
of it i made like i made horse sushi basically here's a bad one though extra bonus content

50:55.920 --> 50:59.760
thank you modern farmer extra bonus content a very bad piece of old farm advice what's the

50:59.760 --> 51:08.880
opposite of wisdom ignorance fuck up farm fuck ups farm fuck up this farm fuck up says um one

51:08.880 --> 51:12.560
of the miscellaneous pamphlets tucked inside the encyclopedia is an old ass encyclopedia

51:12.560 --> 51:18.400
is an older brochure entitled the horseman's friend or pocket counselor that's that's a great

51:18.400 --> 51:23.840
name for a fucking podcast hi we're your pocket counselors we live in your phone nice pockets

51:23.840 --> 51:34.960
uh wb mccrum this is the author's name i'm not making this up maybe this website is is dr wb

51:36.240 --> 51:46.240
mccrum that's m apostrophe crum mccrum i'm dr mccrum and here's a bad piece of horse wisdom

51:46.240 --> 51:51.440
um mccrum offers instruction on how to treat dozens of common horse ailments including weak

51:51.440 --> 51:57.840
eyes or hooks do you mean hooves you bad doctor uh if the horse's eyes or lids are swollen he

51:57.840 --> 52:03.360
recommended bleeding the vein below the eye come here buddy i'm no i'm just gonna goose you out

52:05.040 --> 52:10.320
not a big deal let dr mccrum thank you mccrum dr mccrum get in there and fix you up good

52:10.960 --> 52:17.200
they call me horse killer mccrum this is definitely certainly not good advice it's just

52:17.200 --> 52:22.960

you it's your thermos or it will be if you donate thirty five dollars a month um uh to the maximum

54:48.480 --> 54:54.320

54:54.320 --> 54:58.720
honestly uh thirty five dollars a month in installments you're paying because you really

54:58.720 --> 55:06.160
like the shows um think about how your life would be uh if if without max fund podcasts

55:06.160 --> 55:12.400
probably about the same but a little worse right so we would love it if you would pay us for that

55:12.400 --> 55:17.440
um very into maximumfund.org uh to donate and you'll if you do thirty five dollars a month you

55:17.440 --> 55:21.280

55:35.760 --> 55:40.640
and get strong uh we have we have higher levels like a hundred dollars a month gets you a membership

55:40.640 --> 55:45.760
in the inner circle that's a monthly culture club where one of the hosts of a max fund podcast

55:45.760 --> 55:50.400
uh recommends some cultural thing maybe a book maybe a game maybe a movie maybe i don't know

55:50.400 --> 55:55.440
music uh i don't know i said i don't know like music is obviously an obvious thing that it could

55:55.440 --> 56:00.240
be uh and then uh you'll you'll be a part of the club and you'll get that sent to you in some way

56:00.240 --> 56:05.600
some form or another didn't we do meet the deedles oh maybe we did i think we did meet the deedles

56:23.280 --> 56:30.320
fun con 2017 um so it's it's you know we we don't expect that everybody's gonna be able to ship in

56:30.320 --> 56:35.440
at that level because if so you're like your musky junior and you know we dig that or whatever but

56:35.440 --> 56:40.240
really just like showing any support that you possibly can means means the most to us um because

56:40.240 --> 56:45.280
i i really think about it like we started this thing doing my brother my brother and me once a

56:45.280 --> 56:50.240
week it was this 50 minute goof them up thing that we did and now like we're because of the support

56:50.240 --> 56:53.600
that we've gotten from this network we've been able to like do a bunch of live shows by the way

56:54.240 --> 56:58.720
maybe news on that coming up in the next few weeks uh we've been able to launch a bunch of

56:58.720 --> 57:03.760
new podcasts like the adventure zone which we all love doing so so much uh and and shows like saw

57:03.760 --> 57:08.800
bones and bunker buddies and and shmanners and and all these shows like the reason that we've been

57:08.800 --> 57:13.120
able to expand and basically turn this almost into like our full-time jobs i mean it is tribes

57:13.120 --> 57:16.880
this full-time job uh at this point is because of because of the support we've gotten from you

57:16.880 --> 57:21.680
and it means a lot and if you want to like if you like what we do and you want to help support that

57:21.680 --> 57:27.200
that growth um and allow us to experiment with new stuff and do more of the stuff that you like

57:27.200 --> 57:30.960
then uh think about doing it just go to maximumfund.org donate and if you're already a

57:30.960 --> 57:37.200
donor um this is a great time to kind of consider maybe upgrading your your donorship your donation

57:37.200 --> 57:40.880
um you know we've added a bunch of new shows maybe you've started listening to a bunch of

57:40.880 --> 57:44.960
new shows on the network this year this is a great time to say like you know what i'm gonna

57:44.960 --> 57:49.920
uh raise it up a little bit include some of the other shows i listen to and if you become a donor

57:49.920 --> 57:54.880
if you upgrade your donation be sure that you tweet at us and let us know so that we can say

57:54.880 --> 58:00.320
thank you yeah we also have a challenge we have challenge donors too who have agreed to donate a

58:00.320 --> 58:05.600
certain amount of money for each new donor we get and hopefully we can reach that 5000 new donor and

58:05.600 --> 58:10.080
and upgrading donor goal but every time we get a newer upgrading donor those challenge donors kick

58:10.080 --> 58:14.480
in a little bit of money so you're you're also kind of doubling down on your donation anyway

58:14.480 --> 58:21.120
well listen so that we know five five thousand donors sounds high but our the uh and a lot of

58:21.120 --> 58:27.200
people are right now are saying that we'll never do it our nemesis over at channel 8 say that they

58:27.200 --> 58:33.760
are gonna buy max fun they're gonna buy it the whole thing yeah unless we can get five thousand

58:33.760 --> 58:38.880
donors they're gonna they made a bet yeah and if they buy us they're not gonna use us the way that

58:38.880 --> 58:44.400
we want to be used they're gonna change the name of the network to craps fun and then they're gonna

58:44.400 --> 58:48.960
bulldoze all the shows and turn them into parking lots well no they'll make us keep parking lots

58:48.960 --> 58:52.640
they'll keep making us do the podcast but they get to decide what goes in on it just to like

58:52.640 --> 58:58.640
embarrass us so like the craps fun version of the show would just be like oh my boogers fell out

58:58.640 --> 59:02.320
and like i don't want to say that stuff i don't want to say that stuff because it's embarrassing

59:02.320 --> 59:07.920
but that's what channel 8 wants us to do i'm sorry i know listen i know we hate channel 8 i

59:07.920 --> 59:12.080
know they're gonna buy back fun if we don't get five thousand donors that's hysterical yeah

59:13.760 --> 59:19.680

01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:17.680
it when truck month you know there are people who like only celebrate trucks during truck month

01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:23.040
and you're just like oh you're like one of those once a year truck owners well what if they okay

01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:27.520
instead of establishing a calendar month what if they just did it an easy way to do is just piggy

01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:31.200
back on to another month-long event so how about like lent because then you're gonna get all

01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:35.840
frustrated because you can't drink your mountain dew or you can't jerk off uh but you can go mudding

01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:43.360
in your truck that you bought truck month lent get it and then when it's over you marty grab the fuck

01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:51.360
up or is that before do you do you think people ever um do you think people ever got really

01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:54.720
confused about truck month and then at the end of truck month they put their truck in the garage

01:02:54.720 --> 01:02:59.760
and they're just like i'll see you buddy i love you love you have a great year have a great year

01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:06.320
oh sleep good my buddy i left you a big bowl of car food get hungry do it if you get scared in

01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:10.320
this dark garage just honk for me buddy okay i'll come in here and i'll tell you i won't get in you

01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:14.960
or operate you because that's illegal thanks to obama but anyway i'll tell you a story about the

01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:19.520
better times we had where we trucked together what if you're fucking on the road and you're

01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:24.560
like in tucson trying to get back to dallas but it's like 8 pm the night before truck month ends

01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:28.560
and it's like i gotta fucking go i gotta fucking go it's like the purge like i gotta get back to

01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:35.120
my garage it's gonna turn back into miata holy holy shit no that movie you just described it

01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:42.320
could be literally gremlins is that what happens in gremlins no there's a car called yeah okay

01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:49.920
uh oh i see what if instead of truck month and i did the math here you did two hours a day

01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:56.480
every day for an entire year and that's going to add up to truck month but instead you took

01:03:56.480 --> 01:04:04.160
two hours a day to really appreciate trucks so that's a lot of time that's a significant

01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:09.040
investment would you rather do it all in one block griffin 24 hours a day for 31

01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:14.080
days yeah you'd die exactly i didn't eat today i was too busy praising my truck

01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:20.400
could you schedule at least half of it during sleep hours like you promise yourself you're

01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:26.640
gonna dream about your truck at least once for an hour but what happens if you don't do you have to

01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:33.040
like flog yourself yeah well now you just have to spend an extra hour the next day and then

01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:37.600
you get people who like try to like listen i got a busy weekend of travel coming up my kids with

01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:42.480
two hours thinking about trucks so we're gonna spend four hours thinking about trucks today

01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:47.280
and four hours thinking about trucks on monday i will gladly pay you tuesday for a truck dream

01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:53.200

other yahoo because i don't want to sleep on it it's by sitting by level 9 000 yajoo drew drew

01:07:27.680 --> 01:07:34.240
davenport thank you drew it's by yajoo answers user tara sage who asks do sonic characters have

01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:40.160
last names i really want us to get into the sonic verse more often wait i think there's a lot of

01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:48.400
stuff in there or fuller titles than just sonic knuckles shadow silver blaze amy etc i always

01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:58.240
assumed that his name was like sonic t hedgehog that's ridiculous that's ridiculous okay tails

01:07:58.240 --> 01:08:12.320
yes does have a full name bernie sanders what if what if he stole my heart i mean do you know

01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:18.160
what tails is miles last name o'brien but that's the character from deep space nine i've been

01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:21.760
watching a lot of it can't tell the difference yeah you've been tweeting a lot about deep space

01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:26.640
nine i kind of had to mute mute that hashtag i had to mute it you've been penetrating that hashtag

01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:30.720
i'll do my channel i'll come up with a different form of it you can't hide from my hashtags

01:08:31.280 --> 01:08:38.000
uh miles power yes amy rose yes that's as far as miles per hour no miles holy shit that is what it

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:44.880
means yeah no shit are you kidding me no yeah that was a joke revelation that was a joke

01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:49.760
realization sometimes i throw those in just to see if you guys catch it but yeah i know no i

01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:55.840
know i know i got this yes miles per hour fucking amy rose yes those are the only two i think those

01:08:55.840 --> 01:09:01.840
are the only two that we know but a name a last name can't be the hedgehog or the echidna or the

01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:09.120
bat or the rabbit there is absolutely no way that like knuckles is his given name or sonic like

01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:13.840
we've already established that tails isn't actually called tails so what if sonic's name is like

01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:20.720
stephen herman and he's like call me sonic and it's like no no i'd rather call you but

01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:29.120
by your regular name i'd rather call you sterman like sterman the hedgehog uh now big the cat

01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:37.520
his last name is actually berkowitz which not many berkowitz big berkowitz

01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:45.440
big berkowitz i like that sonic his last name is also berkowitz because him and big are married in

01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:51.680
my head what's what's dr robotnik's first name is it doctor is he a medical doctor has he been

01:09:51.680 --> 01:10:03.760
named doctor his first name is obama obama robotnik bobo robotnik justin if it sounds

01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:06.960
like maybe you're scared off of this question maybe you're afraid to fucking step on the toes

01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:14.240
of the sonic fan verse i literally the the sonic fandom is very perplexing to me because i don't

01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:21.280
know if like i never know if it's sexual or not like i don't know people who like sonic i don't

01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:28.160
know if it's a sex and there's there's some things which is fine it just colors how i would discuss

01:10:28.160 --> 01:10:33.440
it you know what i mean i want you to know something yeah at some point in in all of the

01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:39.280
sonic fandom someone has written sonic fan fiction in which sonic has collected a ring

01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:43.520
looked at another character and said you know where this would go and then put it on his sonic

01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:50.480
penis i don't like that right on his chili dog i mean um i mean they throw it the chest was

01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:55.040
tricky about this is they throw in some landmines like cream the rabbit you can't have a guy named

01:10:55.040 --> 01:11:00.080
cream you can't have a woman named cream rabbit on here what are you doing you can't do have that

01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:06.400
in your video game for kids no way inappropriate there's been crossovers where like sonic and

01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:11.520
mario have done shit together yeah like done sports at the olympics and it's like i can't

01:11:11.520 --> 01:11:17.040
imagine that that you know that changing room between games what's your name mario what's yours

01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:23.920
cream okay are you sure that's what right that's what sonic called me i don't and there's and mario

01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:29.200
has done quite a few crossovers with people through your smash bros and whatnot yeah so the

01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:36.000
sonic universe extends it's huge way farther than anyone could possibly imagine they're all married

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:43.280
in my head no way don't try to pull in this tommy westfall garbage that that that we're like all

01:11:43.280 --> 01:11:48.960
video game characters it's true though it's just to name two nintendo boys name two nintendo guys

01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:54.320
um the those little dipshits from ice climbers they're married to each other

01:11:56.400 --> 01:12:01.600
wow what about the blob from boyness blob and the boy from boyness bob are married yes

01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:07.680
they have some let's just say they have some jelly bean fun but they riven are all of these

01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:14.480
like loving like marriages like they're all married yeah they're all yeah but like think

01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:18.560
about it like it makes sense if you think like it's like if you're the boy from boyness blob

01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:24.160
and the blob there you're stuck in a video game cartridge there's only two entities that don't

01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:30.080
try to kill each other what's he gonna do marry marry the snakes no no i bet the blob has a real

01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:36.400
name and hates being called the blob yeah he's a ghost isn't he i just assumed he was a ghost

01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:41.680
i thought he was a beanbag chair i think travis is suggesting that he's like a jeremy yeah a

01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:50.160
boy and his jeremy i have a name it's jeremy t blob honestly as bowser and ganador fall in love

01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:55.920
very much well yeah they tell you get together and they make spaghetti for each other and they kiss

01:12:55.920 --> 01:13:01.120
and they talk about how hard their day is they talk about how hard their like mario did it again

01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:07.520
a boy stabbed me in the head so the second time and he smashed all my goddamn pots smashed my pots

01:13:07.520 --> 01:13:14.480
i bought those pots stabbed my head it's all bad so you think i'm made of pots justin you again

01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:18.080
sounds like you don't really care about married nintendo characters it sounds like this is not a

01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:23.040
thing that you think about all the time who's married nintendo and take a i i'm i'm just trying

01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:28.560
to be respectful of one person who's permanently masturbating because you just opened a fucking

01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:36.720
dark dark cocoon they're trying to like understand yeah and absorb hey listen that word there's i
