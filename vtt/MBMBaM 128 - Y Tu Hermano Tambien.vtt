WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:48.960
Uh, welcome my brother and my brother and me, an advice show for the modern era.

00:48.960 --> 00:52.960
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother Travis McElroy.

00:52.960 --> 00:56.880
I'm your sweet, sweetest candy pie baby brother Griffin McElroy.

00:56.880 --> 01:01.280
All right, this is the birthday episode. Well, we already did. We did that.

01:01.280 --> 01:04.080
No, no, we're, well, this episode we're recapping the birthday.

01:04.080 --> 01:07.840
Oh, that'll be, that'll be fun for me again for the second week in a row.

01:07.840 --> 01:10.080
Fun for me and applicable and fun.

01:10.880 --> 01:15.040
Uh, I have, I cannot tell you how buckwild it has gotten in the mailbox,

01:15.040 --> 01:17.760
in the, in the McElroy brothers and my brother and me mailbox.

01:17.760 --> 01:27.360
We got, uh, a, a, a magazine from Galiayali and a Mad Libs book and $15 in stone cold cash.

01:28.000 --> 01:34.240
Like we shouldn't be paying her. Yeah. Just like five, three, $5 bills in an envelope.

01:34.240 --> 01:39.200
Oh my God. It's like a meemaw present. Is Galiayali, has she secretly been our memes

01:39.200 --> 01:40.880
this whole time? She's been our meemaw.

01:40.880 --> 01:44.800
I have one picture of a, of a guy dressed like a pharmacist

01:44.800 --> 01:48.080
and on the back it has the words pill monkey scared written on it.

01:48.080 --> 01:48.400
Okay.

01:49.120 --> 01:56.080
So that's cool. Got a watch out for fireballs, uh, uh, postcard or a podcast.

01:56.080 --> 01:59.120
Uh, wait, the podcast is called watch out.

01:59.120 --> 01:59.680
Watch out for fireballs.

01:59.680 --> 02:01.600
And they sent you this as a gift?

02:01.600 --> 02:05.680
A postcard. Yeah. Uh, an ad maybe. Maybe they just tricked me.

02:05.680 --> 02:06.720
Oh, damn it.

02:06.720 --> 02:14.320
Joshua noise sent us anthrax, uh, by which I mean the greatest hits of anthrax.

02:14.320 --> 02:17.440
Oh God. I think I would rather just have the anthrax.

02:18.400 --> 02:21.360
Um, oh, we got a wedding invitation.

02:21.360 --> 02:24.480
Oh, anywhere close by to any of the places that we live?

02:25.040 --> 02:27.120
No, this is to Chicago.

02:27.120 --> 02:29.040
I'd go back to Chicago for a wedding.

02:29.040 --> 02:33.600
Okay. Well you can, you can go see Kristen Kotowski get married to Alistair Stewart.

02:33.600 --> 02:36.320
This wedding invite is gorgeous. I wish you guys could see it.

02:36.320 --> 02:37.680
What's the font? What kind of font are we wearing?

02:37.680 --> 02:44.320
Would they go with a syrup? No, I mean it is completely decorated in literally dozens of

02:44.320 --> 02:46.960
different typographies. It's a gorgeous, gorgeous document.

02:46.960 --> 02:50.560
Are there any gemstones imbued in the, in the, in the paper?

02:50.560 --> 02:51.280
Not as such.

02:51.280 --> 02:54.160
What would you say is the net worth of this wedding invitation?

02:54.800 --> 03:00.720
$13,000. Joe Robson sent me a Pepsi man, uh, action figure.

03:00.720 --> 03:01.360
Oh my God.

03:01.360 --> 03:08.400
And we got Adam, uh, and what looks like Scrans, uh, Mickelson.

03:08.960 --> 03:10.240
That's not a real name.

03:10.240 --> 03:14.160
Sent us a picture, uh, a Grand Canyon, uh, postcard.

03:14.160 --> 03:20.960
And my man, Tommy Fix, sent us Space Jam, a novelization.

03:20.960 --> 03:23.840
This is a brand spanking new copy direct from Amazon, so I don't know.

03:23.840 --> 03:25.760
Okay. Is that book still in print?

03:26.480 --> 03:28.160
Yes. Apparently that book is still in print.

03:28.160 --> 03:32.000
Here's a picture of, uh, 17 babies butts.

03:32.720 --> 03:37.760
Uh, and it says you deserve a 14 bun salute.

03:38.960 --> 03:41.920
And it turns out this is a birthday card from my nanny.

03:41.920 --> 03:46.640
So I should not say I'm sorry about that.

03:46.640 --> 03:51.920
So as long as we're doing a mail call, I got a postcard today or yesterday,

03:51.920 --> 03:55.440
cause mail doesn't typically run on Sundays in the United States of America.

03:55.440 --> 03:56.400
Not as such.

03:56.400 --> 04:00.960
Um, and it has the lead singer of Korn on it, his face.

04:01.680 --> 04:09.520
And it says, come hear a motivational speech about the story of the lead singer of Korn.

04:09.520 --> 04:12.640
And I turned it over and it's for a nearby church.

04:13.440 --> 04:18.080
So that's something that I absolutely have to go to, right?

04:18.080 --> 04:21.600
That is non, that is something they've written about him, like fan fiction

04:21.600 --> 04:24.560
about the lead singer of Korn that would really motivate you.

04:24.560 --> 04:28.960
I think that there probably is a preacher somewhere in Austin, Texas,

04:28.960 --> 04:33.040
who has motivational fanfic that they wrote about Korn band members.

04:34.400 --> 04:35.120
Real quick question.

04:35.120 --> 04:37.040
Has any of this been entertaining so far?

04:37.600 --> 04:39.920
It's hard to say, but that's not really my problem.

04:39.920 --> 04:44.080
No, no, it's our birthday month, but that's not important anymore.

04:44.880 --> 04:46.240
Oh, that's not bullshit.

04:46.240 --> 04:47.120
All that's bullshit.

04:47.120 --> 04:49.200
The only thing I care about is helping people.

04:49.840 --> 04:51.360
You know, that's my thing.

04:51.360 --> 04:52.560
That's where I'm at.

04:52.560 --> 04:54.800
I want to advise people with their problems.

04:54.800 --> 04:57.840
So here's a question from them and then we'll answer it

04:57.840 --> 05:01.760
and see if they're maybe, if not better off, at least not worse.

05:03.040 --> 05:04.800
I like to write a little in my free time.

05:04.800 --> 05:07.920
I'm not super good at it and I'm not trying to get published,

05:07.920 --> 05:09.520
but I have an overactive imagination.

05:09.520 --> 05:11.680
So it seems like a good way to burn off thoughts in my head.

05:12.800 --> 05:14.160
That's nice imagery.

05:14.160 --> 05:16.960
I recently found a good friend of mine also writes for similar reasons.

05:17.760 --> 05:19.600
I've always wanted a writing buddy

05:19.600 --> 05:22.480
where we can both sit down for a week or something and write.

05:22.480 --> 05:23.680
No, sorry, sorry.

05:24.240 --> 05:26.400
Sit down for an hour a week or something and write.

05:27.200 --> 05:28.960
I just want to just come into this sweat lodge.

05:31.200 --> 05:33.200
We're going to go in a can of writing.

05:33.200 --> 05:33.840
Got a lot of canned food.

05:33.840 --> 05:35.600
We don't have any food or water or anything.

05:35.600 --> 05:36.560
There is nowhere to poop.

05:37.360 --> 05:38.880
Please do not in our sweat lodge.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.280
Turn your phone on silent.

05:41.280 --> 05:42.640
What are you doing?

05:42.640 --> 05:44.880
We are in the sweat lodge of advice right now.

05:44.880 --> 05:47.200
How can you take those kinds of distractions?

05:47.200 --> 05:47.760
I can't.

05:47.760 --> 05:49.440
I'm completely out of the mix.

05:49.440 --> 05:51.120
I don't know what we were talking about.

05:51.760 --> 05:52.320
I don't know.

05:53.040 --> 05:55.120
It was so inconsiderate of dad to text me

05:55.120 --> 05:59.280
to tell me that I have holes in my fantasy football lineup.

06:00.080 --> 06:01.600
Anyway, if we ran into a wall,

06:01.600 --> 06:03.200
we could bounce ideas off each other.

06:03.200 --> 06:04.560
Is this a good idea?

06:04.560 --> 06:06.080
How do I suggest this to my friend

06:06.080 --> 06:07.920
without sounding like I'm pressuring them

06:07.920 --> 06:08.960
or sounding like a dick?

06:10.000 --> 06:11.760
Fitzgerald, Seeking Hemingway.

06:14.800 --> 06:16.640
First, I suggest not starting off with

06:16.640 --> 06:18.240
I'm not super good at it.

06:18.240 --> 06:19.600
Yeah.

06:19.600 --> 06:20.080
Can I?

06:20.080 --> 06:20.800
Yeah.

06:20.800 --> 06:21.840
Here's a good suggestion.

06:21.840 --> 06:25.440
Go find a new thing that you are actually super good at.

06:26.080 --> 06:26.480
Maybe?

06:27.200 --> 06:30.080
Like, I just want you to start from as high a point as you best.

06:30.080 --> 06:33.040
That is the biggest thing of success is showing up

06:33.040 --> 06:35.920
and being good at the thing that you want to do already.

06:35.920 --> 06:40.400
I think that writing is intensely personal.

06:40.960 --> 06:44.000
For me, it's like a poetry.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.120
It's like writing poetry.

06:45.120 --> 06:46.400
Writing is like writing.

06:46.400 --> 06:50.080
Writing books is like writing poetry.

06:50.080 --> 06:54.880
For me, putting words on paper is like writing.

06:54.880 --> 06:58.800
I've always likened poetry to like writing a song without music in it.

06:59.840 --> 07:02.240
God, that's beautiful.

07:02.240 --> 07:04.240
That is some lovely imagery.

07:04.240 --> 07:05.200
So like if I said like,

07:06.000 --> 07:09.600
I don't want to wait for our lives to be over.

07:10.160 --> 07:12.480
I want to know right now what will it be?

07:13.280 --> 07:15.920
And then there's a question mark on it instead of a period.

07:15.920 --> 07:18.400
Whoa, whoa, I like that.

07:18.400 --> 07:21.200
And that's, I can say that's mine because I didn't sing it.

07:21.200 --> 07:22.000
You see what I'm saying?

07:22.560 --> 07:27.280
I think that if you go to someone and lay out this plan for them,

07:28.400 --> 07:33.600
it runs a risk of being the weirdest thing they've ever heard.

07:33.600 --> 07:34.480
I really think-

07:34.480 --> 07:36.400
Like I know that this happens in real life.

07:36.400 --> 07:40.400
Like there are lots of writing teams over the years that have like come together

07:40.400 --> 07:43.040
and they have written books together and plays together

07:43.040 --> 07:45.680
and musicals together and like comedy bits together.

07:45.680 --> 07:49.520
But it always, whenever you hear the story of it or read a memoir about it,

07:49.520 --> 07:51.920
it's always so organic and it's like-

07:51.920 --> 07:53.040
That's the thing, right?

07:53.040 --> 07:53.600
Organic.

07:55.200 --> 07:57.040
Here's what you need to do.

07:57.040 --> 07:58.240
You need to go to and say,

07:58.240 --> 08:00.560
hey, I've been writing something.

08:00.560 --> 08:04.480
Would love to get the feedback on it and see what you think.

08:04.480 --> 08:07.200
And then after they're done reading it, they give you their feedback.

08:07.200 --> 08:08.800
You just stand there and they're out.

08:09.360 --> 08:10.560
And then you say,

08:10.560 --> 08:15.680
is there anything you would like to show me?

08:15.680 --> 08:19.520
And then you wait and wait and wait and do not leave the room

08:19.520 --> 08:23.360
until you have words in your hand that they've written for your adjudication.

08:23.360 --> 08:27.760
I also think, not trying to pass judgment, but I am,

08:27.760 --> 08:31.360
that it's a little bit weird proposition,

08:31.360 --> 08:33.760
especially considering there's no end goal

08:33.760 --> 08:36.560
and you're not trying to do anything with it.

08:36.560 --> 08:38.640
Just saying like, we should get together.

08:38.640 --> 08:40.080
They want to grow as writers.

08:40.080 --> 08:40.400
What's wrong?

08:40.400 --> 08:43.760
They want to waste two people's time simultaneously.

08:46.800 --> 08:49.200
It's not trying to grow as writers because you don't have an end goal.

08:49.200 --> 08:52.400
You just want to burn off excess creativity.

08:52.400 --> 08:55.200
Why can't you just be good at writing, Travis?

08:55.200 --> 08:57.680
I play bocce ball to burn off my excess energy

08:57.680 --> 08:59.200
and I would love to be better at that.

08:59.200 --> 09:02.480
No, what I'm saying is that if you go to this person and say,

09:02.480 --> 09:05.760
I want to grow as a writer and I'd love to share ideas

09:05.760 --> 09:08.080
and bounce it back and forth and give each other notes.

09:08.080 --> 09:11.280
But if you just go to them and say, I have a bunch of extra creativity,

09:11.280 --> 09:12.480
let's talk about it.

09:12.480 --> 09:13.120
Help me purge.

09:13.920 --> 09:17.280
Justin, do you bocce to burn off the thoughts in your head?

09:17.280 --> 09:18.240
Is that what you just said?

09:19.520 --> 09:22.640
Yeah, when I'm angry or it's been a long day at the bank,

09:23.520 --> 09:26.400
where I work, I just go home and I bocce.

09:26.400 --> 09:28.560
Justin is actually incapable of dreaming,

09:28.560 --> 09:31.840
so instead he must funnel his dreams through bocce ball.

09:31.840 --> 09:34.000
My dreams are funneled through bocce ball.

09:34.000 --> 09:38.400
So I just, I go out to the field or the ring or the rink

09:38.400 --> 09:41.520
or the course and he's got a bocce to feel.

09:42.640 --> 09:44.480
I roll or toss.

09:44.480 --> 09:51.360
Is there anything you don't have in common with Cliff Huxtable?

09:52.640 --> 09:53.760
Tell me right now.

09:53.760 --> 09:54.560
Sandwiches?

09:54.560 --> 09:55.280
Check.

09:55.280 --> 09:56.160
Gynecology?

09:56.800 --> 09:57.040
Check.

09:57.680 --> 09:59.600
I'm not going to fucking sell out to Jell-O.

09:59.600 --> 10:01.120
That's for god damn sure.

10:01.120 --> 10:04.400
Big gelatin is going to keep their hands off my uterus.

10:04.400 --> 10:06.640
Justin's always been custard or nothing.

10:06.640 --> 10:07.520
Custard or nothing, that's my jam.

10:07.520 --> 10:08.720
Hey, real quick.

10:09.520 --> 10:12.480
If we could go, I don't know how long we're going to keep doing the show.

10:13.520 --> 10:15.840
I think we've got at least another 10 episodes in us,

10:15.840 --> 10:20.640
but if we could just go without saying the words gelatin and uterus in the same breath.

10:22.160 --> 10:22.960
It sounds fine.

10:23.680 --> 10:25.200
Yeah, I'd say 10 episodes tops.

10:25.200 --> 10:30.400
But you got to let this, this cannot be a relationship that you pitch.

10:31.040 --> 10:32.880
It's got to be something that you develop.

10:32.880 --> 10:33.840
Start small.

10:33.840 --> 10:39.280
Don't try to say, hey, I would like us to have a writing relationship that

10:41.200 --> 10:45.520
lasts for years and is super productive and helps us both grow as writers.

10:45.520 --> 10:47.760
You just got to say, you got to start at normal.

10:47.760 --> 10:48.560
You know what I mean?

10:48.560 --> 10:52.240
That would be like proposing marriage to the lady at the bank.

10:52.240 --> 10:55.440
Like just say, you know, start at the ground level.

10:55.440 --> 10:57.760
If you introduce this level of formality into it,

10:57.760 --> 10:59.760
then you're going to have to lay down all kinds of ground rules.

10:59.760 --> 11:01.440
If it's organic, then you know what you're getting into.

11:01.440 --> 11:05.840
But if you have to like write up a constitution for how this thing's going to work,

11:05.840 --> 11:10.480
then you have to be like, you know, I don't want to read your sci-fi erotica.

11:10.480 --> 11:13.520
Like just off the jump.

11:13.520 --> 11:14.480
Like I don't want that.

11:15.680 --> 11:17.680
If it's got slash fic in it anywhere.

11:17.680 --> 11:22.000
Mm hmm. If you write today show slash fic, I would like to read that.

11:22.960 --> 11:26.640
Yeah, because what if it's like just like the Citizen Kane of slash fic

11:26.640 --> 11:28.720
or Citizen Kane slash fiction.

11:28.720 --> 11:31.600
Al Roker takes out everything.

11:31.600 --> 11:32.720
He gets everything.

11:32.720 --> 11:33.760
You get to see his whole.

11:33.760 --> 11:34.480
It's all out.

11:34.480 --> 11:36.240
You get to see his whole tackle box.

11:37.600 --> 11:42.640
Well, if Scott dials up his list of 100 year old perverts

11:42.640 --> 11:50.800
and he calls them over for sex, old smucker sex.

11:52.800 --> 11:55.200
And then Ann Curry's like, how could you do this to me?

11:57.760 --> 11:59.920
Jilted lover Ann Curry returns.

11:59.920 --> 12:00.560
Do you think?

12:01.840 --> 12:02.400
Yeah.

12:02.400 --> 12:03.040
Do you?

12:03.040 --> 12:04.880
You know what I'm about to ask, right?

12:04.880 --> 12:06.240
I know who you're at.

12:06.240 --> 12:08.800
Everyone on today show is secretly fucking, right?

12:09.920 --> 12:10.400
Yeah.

12:10.400 --> 12:12.080
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

12:12.800 --> 12:15.280
When he's like from the moment Roker's like,

12:15.280 --> 12:18.640
that's what's happening in the in our country.

12:18.640 --> 12:20.640
Here's what's happening in your neck of the wood.

12:20.640 --> 12:22.400
He's on that moment.

12:22.400 --> 12:26.320
He's like reaching for the zipper to start blasting.

12:28.160 --> 12:30.400
He's like, get the blasting caps.

12:30.400 --> 12:31.840
I'm going to the sex mine.

12:32.640 --> 12:35.440
I have maybe 45 seconds.

12:35.440 --> 12:40.400
Well, I line up the holes.

12:40.400 --> 12:42.000
It's time to play some Roker poker.

12:42.000 --> 12:42.560
Come over here.

12:43.440 --> 12:43.920
Hold on.

12:44.560 --> 12:45.360
Hold on.

12:45.360 --> 12:46.240
Matt Lauer.

12:46.240 --> 12:49.760
Bring your bring your weird leukemia head over here.

12:49.760 --> 12:50.240
Matt Lauer.

12:51.440 --> 12:53.120
I want to blast into it.

12:53.120 --> 12:55.280
Matt Lauer used to look so good and healthy.

12:55.280 --> 12:56.480
What happened?

12:56.480 --> 12:58.080
You'd see that full of the Olympics.

12:58.080 --> 12:59.520
Like, is he competing?

13:00.240 --> 13:01.200
God damn.

13:01.920 --> 13:02.800
He looked fantastic.

13:02.800 --> 13:03.840
He looked fantastic.

13:03.840 --> 13:06.080
I think I think it's like we have like a portrait

13:06.080 --> 13:08.720
of Dorian Gray scenario between Roker and Lauer

13:08.720 --> 13:11.600
because one is looking hundo percent better

13:11.600 --> 13:13.520
and the other one is just shriveling.

13:13.520 --> 13:15.440
Roker's looking fantastic.

13:15.440 --> 13:17.440
Like Darth Palpatus or whatever.

13:17.440 --> 13:20.480
Yeah, Lauer looks like he keeps sneaking peeks

13:20.480 --> 13:21.840
at the Ark of the Covenant.

13:21.840 --> 13:23.280
He's not looking at it full blast.

13:23.280 --> 13:25.840
He's taking little sips out of the wrong grail.

13:26.800 --> 13:30.960
Right, just a little just wetness whistle with that.

13:30.960 --> 13:34.240
Fuck, why are we so mean to people we've never met?

13:35.360 --> 13:38.000
Because we keep hoping that we will meet them

13:38.000 --> 13:39.600
and they'll at least know who we are.

13:39.600 --> 13:41.520
That's all like, that's all, that's my dream.

13:42.160 --> 13:42.800
You guys want a yahoo?

13:42.800 --> 13:44.640
I've always wanted Matt Lauer to just yell at me

13:44.640 --> 13:45.760
across the crowded bar.

13:46.720 --> 13:48.000
Hey, fuck you!

13:48.000 --> 13:48.880
You guys want a yahoo?

13:49.440 --> 13:49.680
Yeah.

13:51.040 --> 13:52.240
God, I have so many good ones.

13:52.240 --> 13:53.520
Thank you everyone who sent them in.

13:54.560 --> 13:55.200
Please keep it up.

13:55.200 --> 13:56.480
It was such a joy to read these.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.240
This yahoo was sent in by John Tabler.

14:00.240 --> 14:01.040
Thank you, John.

14:01.760 --> 14:05.120
It's by yahoo answers user, Vela OK, who asks,

14:07.280 --> 14:09.600
what does it take to start up a new cemetery?

14:11.760 --> 14:12.400
Commitment.

14:12.960 --> 14:13.520
I guess.

14:14.080 --> 14:15.360
Business is going to be good.

14:15.360 --> 14:18.080
I predict more people are going to be dying all the time.

14:18.080 --> 14:18.480
Yup.

14:19.600 --> 14:20.400
I want to offer.

14:22.400 --> 14:23.200
Bold.

14:23.200 --> 14:25.040
Nice one, Nostradamus.

14:25.040 --> 14:27.920
I want to offer preservative free burials

14:27.920 --> 14:31.840
so the body decomposes faster and gets back to being fertilizer ASAP.

14:31.840 --> 14:32.960
I love that.

14:32.960 --> 14:33.520
I love that.

14:33.520 --> 14:34.640
And what a great trail.

14:34.640 --> 14:35.360
It's pretty green.

14:35.360 --> 14:35.680
Listen, let's.

14:35.680 --> 14:36.560
So big on that.

14:36.560 --> 14:37.280
Right off the jump.

14:37.280 --> 14:38.640
Let's say everyone's going to die.

14:40.240 --> 14:43.840
Could be today, could be tomorrow, but it's definitely one of those two.

14:43.840 --> 14:44.720
It is today.

14:44.720 --> 14:45.840
It's either today or tomorrow.

14:47.200 --> 14:48.000
Yeah, everybody.

14:48.000 --> 14:48.400
That's true.

14:48.400 --> 14:52.080
This is a booming business because like, have you been to a cemetery?

14:52.080 --> 14:55.520
Have you ever been to a cemetery and been like, oh, this is so spacious?

14:55.520 --> 14:56.320
No, you haven't.

14:56.320 --> 14:57.280
No, you haven't.

14:57.280 --> 15:02.320
You know, this is a good point, though, because there are many cemeteries.

15:03.120 --> 15:09.200
But at the beginning, you're just going to be that guy that buried a body in his yard.

15:09.200 --> 15:11.680
You know, it's very hard to do this homegrown.

15:12.240 --> 15:14.160
It's very hard to do a grassroots.

15:15.040 --> 15:17.440
You don't see a lot of cemetery startups.

15:17.440 --> 15:17.840
Right.

15:17.840 --> 15:18.720
Yeah, it's a.

15:18.720 --> 15:20.880
Just a man and a shovel.

15:20.880 --> 15:21.600
Completely.

15:21.600 --> 15:28.800
Going really good, we've moved from a from single hidden corpse to sort of a level,

15:28.800 --> 15:32.320
I would say, tantamount to an Indian burial ground right now.

15:32.320 --> 15:33.840
OK, so here's the thought I just had.

15:33.840 --> 15:34.800
Let me throw this out.

15:34.800 --> 15:36.000
OK, what?

15:36.560 --> 15:42.640
Think of like a food truck, but instead it was like a crematorium on wheels.

15:42.640 --> 15:48.880
Travis, if you if you took that show, if you took that show on the fucking road here in Austin,

15:48.880 --> 15:51.520
you would be a quadrillionaire.

15:51.520 --> 15:53.200
Everyone would want to die with you.

15:54.480 --> 15:55.600
This is what I'm saying.

15:55.600 --> 15:56.160
Oh, my God.

15:56.160 --> 15:59.920
And you know, Travis just said that as a joke.

15:59.920 --> 16:05.440
But and but like before this episode's over, he's going to get a harried phone call from DLC.

16:06.720 --> 16:08.480
Listen, I want to do it.

16:08.480 --> 16:09.520
I call as fast as I could.

16:09.520 --> 16:13.920
Your dad, while you do it, just fight, fight with your old fat dad and please.

16:16.320 --> 16:18.080
Can you hire some stupid guy?

16:18.080 --> 16:20.560
Please, please, please hire a dumb guy.

16:20.560 --> 16:21.760
And fight with your old dad.

16:22.320 --> 16:23.440
I was just thinking about it.

16:24.160 --> 16:28.240
It probably wouldn't succeed in Austin because everybody in Austin is like 22 years old.

16:28.240 --> 16:33.680
I think if anyone ever died, if anyone ever died in Austin, it would be like Logan's run.

16:33.680 --> 16:34.560
Like, what?

16:34.560 --> 16:35.200
What?

16:35.200 --> 16:36.480
Why isn't he moving?

16:36.480 --> 16:37.200
This is weird.

16:37.920 --> 16:39.440
Yo, Tyler, wake up.

16:39.440 --> 16:40.320
Here's a PBR.

16:41.760 --> 16:42.080
Come on.

16:42.080 --> 16:44.000
There's a concert in two minutes.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.840
Tyler, God, he's sleepy.

16:46.640 --> 16:48.240
Let's turn him into a Wi-Fi hotspot.

16:48.240 --> 16:51.200
Holy shit.

16:51.200 --> 16:52.560
That could be your business.

16:52.560 --> 16:56.320
Is there any, any cemetery with Wi-Fi in it?

16:56.320 --> 16:57.040
Probably not.

16:58.080 --> 16:58.880
Probably not.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.760
This is what Pop Harm would have wanted.

17:02.480 --> 17:05.760
He would have wanted me to sit here and browse my sites.

17:05.760 --> 17:06.560
Browse my sites?

17:06.560 --> 17:08.480
I'm Instagramming your grave site.

17:08.480 --> 17:09.040
Do you like it?

17:09.680 --> 17:12.080
Sites, we'll call it sites and grave sites.

17:12.080 --> 17:13.840
I came to put some flowers on here.

17:13.840 --> 17:16.080
Instead, I'm going to grow some flowers in Farmville.

17:16.080 --> 17:16.800
I love you, Pop.

17:16.800 --> 17:17.840
I love you, Pop Pop.

17:17.840 --> 17:18.640
You're 22.

17:23.120 --> 17:25.760
What would you call your truck

17:26.320 --> 17:31.280
that drove around the city and let people put dead bodies in it?

17:31.280 --> 17:33.120
What would you, what would you call that?

17:35.600 --> 17:38.960
I was, I've been sitting here trying to think of a way

17:38.960 --> 17:42.560
to play Nash Bridges, like sort of like Ash Bridges.

17:42.560 --> 17:43.440
And I like to-

17:43.440 --> 17:43.920
Burnin' Rubber.

17:44.560 --> 17:46.240
Burnin' Rubber is not bad.

17:46.240 --> 17:46.720
It's not bad.

17:46.720 --> 17:49.200
I, what, would you have music?

17:50.800 --> 17:53.680
Like when, like, like an ice cream truck?

17:53.680 --> 17:54.240
Yeah, right.

17:54.240 --> 17:54.720
Exactly.

17:57.760 --> 18:00.080
No, I think you would go, want to go classy.

18:00.080 --> 18:03.040
I think like, hit it with Don't Fear the Reaper

18:03.040 --> 18:06.480
or maybe Wider Shade of Pale or maybe Frankenstein.

18:06.480 --> 18:07.920
Oh, Frankenstein would be good.

18:08.880 --> 18:10.400
All your corpses here.

18:10.400 --> 18:11.920
We turn them into fuel.

18:11.920 --> 18:17.280
It's, I think-

18:17.280 --> 18:19.280
What if that truck ran on the body?

18:19.280 --> 18:20.000
That's what I'm saying.

18:20.960 --> 18:22.400
That's energy for the truck.

18:22.400 --> 18:23.840
And then you call, it's totally green.

18:24.640 --> 18:25.840
Oh man, well.

18:25.840 --> 18:30.160
When you give your loved one over to the loving care of Burnin' Rubber,

18:31.520 --> 18:33.200
first of all, sorry for the Frankenstein.

18:34.080 --> 18:38.240
We are a completely green company with no overhead

18:38.240 --> 18:41.360
and rest assured that your loved one will get us down

18:41.360 --> 18:42.480
to like the corner.

18:43.840 --> 18:47.040
We do need to pick up someone every 20 feet.

18:47.040 --> 18:50.640
Yes, this is going to require a lot of corpses.

18:50.640 --> 18:52.720
So if you've been holding on to them for a while,

18:52.720 --> 18:54.400
that's probably not legal.

18:55.120 --> 18:57.360
And for every corpse that you pay us to burn,

18:57.920 --> 19:01.840
we'll burn the corpse of a needy child somewhere in Africa.

19:01.840 --> 19:05.440
So it's sort of, yeah, it's really nice actually.

19:05.440 --> 19:07.760
It's, I'm so glad Tom's got into that.

19:07.760 --> 19:11.680
We offer a corpse for corpse guarantee.

19:13.200 --> 19:14.480
How do you open?

19:14.480 --> 19:17.120
I'm sitting here, it's a real noodle scratcher.

19:17.120 --> 19:18.080
How do you-

19:18.080 --> 19:20.960
There's got to be an extensive permit process, right?

19:20.960 --> 19:21.680
More importantly though,

19:21.680 --> 19:25.600
you've got to have like a pretty big install base from the get-go, right?

19:25.600 --> 19:29.120
Like you've got to have like 20 corpses at the start.

19:29.120 --> 19:31.920
Well, I bet the toughest part is convincing the first person.

19:31.920 --> 19:32.800
Right, that's what I'm saying.

19:32.800 --> 19:34.800
You can't just have the first person.

19:34.800 --> 19:38.000
You have to have, they don't want to be lonely in the ground.

19:38.000 --> 19:38.800
You know what I mean?

19:38.800 --> 19:42.160
You got to have like 20 people like to start out.

19:42.160 --> 19:42.800
You got to, there has to be like-

19:42.800 --> 19:44.400
At least enough to keep dogs out.

19:44.400 --> 19:46.400
There has to be like a train crash.

19:46.400 --> 19:49.040
And then you're like, this is my moment, you know?

19:49.680 --> 19:52.960
I bet though, it's just like when you open like a new condo or something

19:52.960 --> 19:56.000
and you're like, everybody wants to get in on the ground floor

19:56.000 --> 19:58.640
and like you want to, everybody wants under the trees, you know?

19:58.640 --> 19:59.040
Yeah.

19:59.040 --> 20:00.960
Everybody wants to get the spot under the tree.

20:00.960 --> 20:01.520
Yes.

20:01.520 --> 20:02.080
Sure.

20:02.080 --> 20:03.040
God, it doesn't matter.

20:03.040 --> 20:05.200
None of this fucking matters.

20:05.200 --> 20:07.600
Ugh, just leave me in the alley.

20:10.320 --> 20:12.400
Just prop me up beside that jukebox.

20:12.400 --> 20:16.240
Is there a commercial option in the mainland United States

20:16.240 --> 20:18.160
for a Tibetan sky burial?

20:18.160 --> 20:19.520
Is that an option?

20:19.520 --> 20:21.280
Cover me in honey, leave me on a mountain.

20:21.280 --> 20:22.640
Let the birds deal with it.

20:22.640 --> 20:24.960
Fly me into the sky so I can be closer to Jizu.

20:25.680 --> 20:28.560
Everybody read fucking Stiff by Mary Roach.

20:28.560 --> 20:28.800
Yeah.

20:29.840 --> 20:32.080
Stop asking about dead people and just read Stiff.

20:32.080 --> 20:33.520
Just friend of the show, Mary Roach.

20:33.520 --> 20:36.880
Dissolve yourself and pour yourself like in a gutter somewhere.

20:36.880 --> 20:38.080
It doesn't matter.

20:38.080 --> 20:41.120
You're just eat honey for like 18 days or whatever

20:41.120 --> 20:42.960
and then die for a while in some honey

20:42.960 --> 20:45.360
and then have people eat you to heal themselves.

20:45.360 --> 20:46.160
Is that a real thing?

20:46.720 --> 20:47.680
Yeah, it's in Stiff.

20:48.320 --> 20:48.800
Ugh.

20:48.800 --> 20:49.760
It's cadaver candy.

20:49.760 --> 20:51.760
Stiff is an appropriate name for that book.

20:51.760 --> 20:54.240
Ugh, did you have an erection?

20:54.240 --> 20:59.280
Because of the erection I have, I'm thinking of eating a dead honey man.

20:59.280 --> 21:01.760
And I mean, honey woman.

21:01.760 --> 21:02.640
Shit, is that gay?

21:05.280 --> 21:06.480
You know how I want to go?

21:06.480 --> 21:11.760
I want you to melt me in that stuff from Iframe Roger Rabbit.

21:14.880 --> 21:18.880
Hey Dylan, I finally listened to that podcast you recommended.

21:18.880 --> 21:19.280
Oh yeah?

21:19.280 --> 21:19.920
What did you think?

21:19.920 --> 21:23.520
Well, for the first 15 minutes, they talked about things they got in the mail.

21:23.520 --> 21:24.640
For their birthdays.

21:24.640 --> 21:26.480
They talked about presents they'd receive.

21:26.480 --> 21:28.160
And then they talked about death for 20 minutes

21:28.160 --> 21:29.280
and then I hung myself.

21:29.280 --> 21:30.240
I'm a ghost, Dylan.

21:30.880 --> 21:31.600
Hi Dylan.

21:31.600 --> 21:34.160
And you said they talked about like dildos or something,

21:34.160 --> 21:37.520
but they didn't like electric dildos every week?

21:37.520 --> 21:38.640
They didn't do that.

21:38.640 --> 21:41.920
They talked about Cliff Huxtable and then I killed myself.

21:42.880 --> 21:45.440
Yeah, but you know the one part I did like?

21:46.080 --> 21:47.040
Was the money zone.

21:47.040 --> 22:02.080
I want to tell you guys about ussflagship.com.

22:02.080 --> 22:06.000
They have, first and foremost, of all of our corporate sponsors,

22:06.000 --> 22:08.720
the best call to arms I've ever seen.

22:08.720 --> 22:12.720
Travis, hit me with it because I think only you're going to be able to do justice.

22:12.720 --> 22:13.200
Got it.

22:13.200 --> 22:14.480
What's the call to action?

22:14.480 --> 22:17.040
Well, check out ussflagship.com.

22:17.040 --> 22:19.360
Read our stuff and then do your own thing.

22:19.360 --> 22:20.400
Whatever it is.

22:20.400 --> 22:21.680
Make your dreams come true.

22:21.680 --> 22:22.180
Fuck.

22:22.960 --> 22:23.460
Yeah.

22:24.320 --> 22:25.200
Right?

22:25.200 --> 22:26.640
That gets me so excited.

22:26.640 --> 22:29.680
Guys, I've been waiting for the push I needed and this is it.

22:29.680 --> 22:31.120
I'm opening my own cemetery.

22:32.640 --> 22:35.520
The flagship will host your amateur cemetery.

22:35.520 --> 22:36.320
Guess what it's called?

22:37.280 --> 22:38.640
Cementary.

22:38.640 --> 22:45.840
Cementary, because, because I, god, I fuck this.

22:45.840 --> 22:46.400
I don't know.

22:46.400 --> 22:46.720
Don't, don't.

22:46.720 --> 22:47.200
It gets, there's.

22:47.200 --> 22:47.920
No, you did your best.

22:47.920 --> 22:49.840
Cum is involved somewhere.

22:53.600 --> 22:56.560
Yeah, we've got, so there's everything.

22:56.560 --> 23:01.600
I'm looking at the flagship and I'm seeing four or five things that I want to read right now.

23:01.600 --> 23:08.240
There's a weekly recap of Dawn of the Dead from a foremost expert on the zombie apocalypse.

23:08.240 --> 23:10.400
There's a, there's a ton of good stuff on here.

23:10.400 --> 23:16.400
ussflagship.com and I always tell people, you know, if you're interested in writing,

23:16.400 --> 23:23.040
if you want to forge a writing partnership with somebody else, why not do it on flagship?

23:23.680 --> 23:26.320
So that way you don't have to see the person.

23:26.320 --> 23:30.240
I think literally at the beginning of this episode, we said just stop writing,

23:30.240 --> 23:36.640
which I think the good, good people, the captains of the flagship would be, would disapprove.

23:36.640 --> 23:40.000
Yeah, so they have a website, ussflagship.com.

23:40.000 --> 23:43.680
They also have a Twitter, ussflagship.

23:43.680 --> 23:47.280
A lot of good stuff to read and more importantly, go do your thing there.

23:47.280 --> 23:50.000
Go get busy, you know, get busy.

23:50.000 --> 23:53.520
I have this saying that I came up with, get busy living or get busy dying.

23:54.320 --> 23:57.840
I had this phrase I came up with and it's, get busy child.

23:57.840 --> 23:59.760
And then behind it, there's like this bass is like,

24:02.640 --> 24:04.800
and then I keep saying it like over and over again.

24:04.800 --> 24:06.400
And then all of a sudden all these teens show up.

24:06.400 --> 24:08.880
And they're on ecstasy and there's jumping up and down.

24:08.880 --> 24:12.720
And the lights are going off and we're just like fucking tearing this warehouse apart.

24:13.600 --> 24:15.040
I think I might be addicted to drugs.

24:16.880 --> 24:26.000
I was saying that I came up with and it's, we're fighting for our right to live, to exist.

24:26.000 --> 24:30.960
And should we win the day, the 4th of July will no longer be known as an American holiday.

24:30.960 --> 24:33.360
But as the day when the world declared in one voice,

24:33.360 --> 24:37.360
we will not go quietly into the night, we will not vanish without a fight.

24:37.360 --> 24:38.240
We're going to live on.

24:38.800 --> 24:39.680
We're going to survive.

24:40.480 --> 24:43.680
Today, we celebrate our independence day.

24:43.680 --> 24:45.040
Guys, where's the beef?

24:49.840 --> 24:50.560
Got us again.

24:52.480 --> 24:53.360
Is that something you came up with?

24:53.360 --> 24:53.860
Got it.

24:54.400 --> 24:55.120
I did get it.

24:56.320 --> 24:56.800
You got it.

24:56.800 --> 24:57.600
Get busy, child.

24:58.640 --> 25:00.640
So go to ussflagship.com or follow them on Twitter.

25:00.640 --> 25:04.400
Can I publish all those things I said?

25:04.400 --> 25:04.880
Sorry?

25:04.880 --> 25:06.560
Can I publish those things I said?

25:06.560 --> 25:10.080
Like I want to find some way to profit off of get busy, child, and where's the beef?

25:10.080 --> 25:10.880
But I don't know.

25:10.880 --> 25:14.800
Tell you what, when you feel close to death, I'll visit you every Tuesday

25:14.800 --> 25:16.880
and you just tell me all the smart shit that you know about.

25:16.880 --> 25:17.280
Okay.

25:17.280 --> 25:21.920
And then I'll publish it in a book, Tuesday with Ditto, and we'll both get rich.

25:21.920 --> 25:24.000
I'll get rich, but I'll pay for it.

25:24.000 --> 25:24.480
You'll be dead.

25:24.480 --> 25:28.640
When you make someone rich and then you die, then that shit pays forward in heaven.

25:28.640 --> 25:31.440
And I really hope I get to be there.

25:32.000 --> 25:35.600
If one of the five people Mitch Alba meets in heaven is Maury.

25:35.600 --> 25:38.480
I really hope he's there when Maury wants to slice.

25:38.480 --> 25:39.760
What if it's not?

25:39.760 --> 25:42.320
What if five people show up and Maury and Maury's like,

25:42.320 --> 25:45.600
hey, Mitch, what's up?

25:45.600 --> 25:49.680
I thought we had like a special thing around the middle of the week, Mitch.

25:50.480 --> 25:51.360
Mitch, do you remember?

25:51.360 --> 25:56.640
I remember, Mitch, I can watch your bank statements from heaven, Mitch.

25:56.640 --> 26:00.080
Mitch, me and Jesus are very disappointed in you.

26:00.800 --> 26:04.320
All that wise shit and you've been the one making the bank.

26:06.160 --> 26:06.560
Maury.

26:07.680 --> 26:08.720
Tuesdays with Maury.

26:09.440 --> 26:14.560
His Mitch Alba's hell is he has to spend every Tuesday talking to that old cantankerous bag.

26:14.560 --> 26:21.520
But Tuesday, Maury was a beautiful person and he taught me a lot,

26:22.400 --> 26:24.240
but I should have given him more money.

26:25.200 --> 26:26.400
I'm really sorry.

26:26.400 --> 26:27.200
Maury.

26:27.200 --> 26:31.040
If he hadn't been spending Wednesdays with Maury's wife, you know?

26:31.040 --> 26:34.480
I hope the five people I meet in heaven are in sync.

26:38.240 --> 26:40.000
Personally, personally speaking.

26:41.200 --> 26:42.080
What about you guys?

26:42.080 --> 26:43.200
The five people I meet in heaven?

26:44.080 --> 26:44.320
Yeah.

26:46.800 --> 26:47.920
I'm a BSB man.

26:49.120 --> 26:49.840
You're BSB?

26:51.600 --> 26:53.280
At least one of those guys is dead, right?

26:53.280 --> 26:55.440
As far as I know, they're all dead.

26:55.440 --> 26:55.920
Travis?

26:55.920 --> 27:01.680
I would like to meet the four guys from 98 Degrees and only one of the guys from N-Sync,

27:01.680 --> 27:03.360
but I'll leave that up to Jesus.

27:04.160 --> 27:05.120
Which guy it is, Jesus?

27:05.120 --> 27:08.080
I want to meet the entire cast and crew of the Red Green Show,

27:08.080 --> 27:10.240
because I think that's probably five people.

27:10.240 --> 27:17.280
Do you think that the N-Sync in heaven, they're just like fucking swamped with all these five

27:17.280 --> 27:18.320
people appearances?

27:18.320 --> 27:18.320
Oh yeah.

27:18.320 --> 27:25.840
Oh yeah, like a teenager dies, they're like, oh god, god damn it.

27:25.840 --> 27:27.120
And God's like, what?

27:27.120 --> 27:28.160
And they're like, no.

27:28.160 --> 27:31.520
And then he's like, get to work N-Sync, I brought you here for a reason.

27:31.520 --> 27:33.520
Do you want to go to hell, like 98 Degrees?

27:33.520 --> 27:36.000
You're on a work release program from hell.

27:36.000 --> 27:42.480
Why are we getting so like, we are engaging with some like really serious death issues.

27:42.480 --> 27:44.640
I feel like we're playing with the Ouija right now.

27:44.640 --> 27:48.640
I feel like we've dipped into the Ouija and we're harnessing its power.

27:48.640 --> 27:49.440
Hey, just real quick.

27:49.440 --> 27:50.800
Can I change my five people?

27:50.800 --> 27:51.840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

27:51.840 --> 27:52.800
Yeah, sure try.

27:52.800 --> 27:55.840
Okay, because mine is going to be the five main characters from Entourage,

27:55.840 --> 27:57.440
and I'm including Jeremy Pivot in there.

27:57.440 --> 27:58.000
I like that.

27:58.800 --> 28:01.600
Because my personal heaven is that they're all my Entourage.

28:02.320 --> 28:04.720
And I don't mean the actors, I mean the characters.

28:05.920 --> 28:06.560
Can I change?

28:06.560 --> 28:08.640
Sorry, can I change mine again?

28:09.440 --> 28:09.840
Yeah.

28:09.840 --> 28:10.720
Okay, cool.

28:10.720 --> 28:15.520
I want to go with the Affleck Duck and I want...

28:17.600 --> 28:18.720
Wait, Gilbert Gottfried?

28:18.720 --> 28:20.720
No, no, no, the actual Affleck Duck.

28:20.720 --> 28:24.240
I think you said Affleck Duck, like Ben Affleck's Duck.

28:24.240 --> 28:26.320
I want Ben Affleck's pet duck.

28:26.320 --> 28:29.120
What about four Affleck Ducks and Ben Affleck?

28:29.120 --> 28:29.440
Okay.

28:30.560 --> 28:32.400
And you have to guess which one's which.

28:32.400 --> 28:36.240
Frans, we want to take a moment to tell you about our best friend, Bob Ball.

28:37.360 --> 28:39.120
He's a voiceover artist.

28:39.120 --> 28:40.480
He's an entrepreneur.

28:40.480 --> 28:41.440
I think I can say that.

28:42.640 --> 28:46.320
He has a show called Pop Quizical that...

28:46.320 --> 28:48.960
You know, so many podcasts take so much of your time.

28:49.520 --> 28:51.520
Like this one, for example.

28:51.520 --> 28:54.160
And all you get in exchange is us.

28:54.160 --> 28:59.280
A fucking hour of our lives that we've given to you as a fucking gift.

28:59.280 --> 29:04.080
Three total man hours of our precious lives, you thankless thug.

29:05.840 --> 29:08.400
Bob Ball is not as generous as we are.

29:08.400 --> 29:09.920
His show is much shorter.

29:09.920 --> 29:14.880
But it is a pretty great listen week in, week out.

29:15.520 --> 29:20.960
You can find it at PopQuizical.com or you can find his own page at Bob Ball VO.

29:20.960 --> 29:23.600
It's a trivia show that he hosts himself.

29:23.600 --> 29:24.960
It's beautifully produced.

29:24.960 --> 29:26.400
Had new topic every week.

29:26.400 --> 29:29.360
The most recent is about profanity, which is a lot of fun.

29:29.360 --> 29:30.480
It's fucking awesome.

29:31.440 --> 29:32.240
It's fucking great.

29:32.240 --> 29:32.800
Pussies!

29:35.040 --> 29:38.800
He does a hint show every week and the show is great and it's a lot of fun.

29:38.800 --> 29:43.440
And it's sort of a quick, a quick hit to cleanse the palette.

29:43.440 --> 29:44.320
Just a little bump.

29:44.320 --> 29:45.440
Just a little knowledge bump.

29:46.480 --> 29:46.960
Just a hint.

29:46.960 --> 29:48.160
I can stop whenever I want.

29:49.920 --> 29:54.080
Even if you want to dip back to episode 20, there is...

29:55.360 --> 29:57.600
My Brother, My Brother and Me is a topic.

29:57.600 --> 29:58.400
I'll listen to you.

29:59.040 --> 30:01.200
Listen, don't listen to the rest of the podcast.

30:01.200 --> 30:02.880
Just listen to the bit that's about us.

30:04.480 --> 30:06.240
Get out of your own asshole.

30:06.240 --> 30:08.080
I didn't, I didn't mean that.

30:08.080 --> 30:08.560
I'm sorry.

30:10.560 --> 30:11.120
Number four.

30:11.120 --> 30:12.160
The fourth one's about us.

30:12.160 --> 30:14.000
Get out of your asshole.

30:14.000 --> 30:15.440
Oh, sorry.

30:15.440 --> 30:18.000
Go to Bob Ball VO or popquizzical.com.

30:18.640 --> 30:21.520
Follow them on Twitter and enjoy the show.

30:21.520 --> 30:22.240
I think you're really gonna like it.

30:22.240 --> 30:27.120
If you hear, while listening to the podcast, a strange echo coming from Justin's audio source,

30:27.120 --> 30:28.960
it's because he's inside his own asshole.

30:28.960 --> 30:32.080
And it's cavernous and marbly in there.

30:32.080 --> 30:32.800
Bob Ball VO.

30:32.800 --> 30:33.520
Bob Ball VO.

30:33.520 --> 30:34.400
Justin's.

30:34.400 --> 30:37.840
Bob Ball VO Justin's Asshole.com.

30:37.840 --> 30:39.120
Let's have another death question.

30:39.120 --> 30:41.280
This was, Yahoo was sent in by Jacob Locker.

30:41.280 --> 30:42.480
So you know it's gonna be good.

30:43.200 --> 30:43.680
Thanks, Jacob.

30:43.680 --> 30:45.600
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Philip, who asks,

30:45.600 --> 30:48.400
how much would it cost to bronze my corpse when I die?

30:51.600 --> 30:56.880
The first answer is exactly $32,988, I guess.

30:57.760 --> 30:59.760
Is that including like all the, like the fees?

30:59.760 --> 31:03.360
I like this idea so much.

31:03.360 --> 31:05.680
For me, personally, let me tell you why.

31:06.960 --> 31:07.440
Okay.

31:07.440 --> 31:13.440
Just in case I ever do something awesome enough to merit a statue built in my honor,

31:13.440 --> 31:16.400
it's like, pre-pro, you know what I mean?

31:17.520 --> 31:19.440
Like, they don't have to worry about,

31:19.440 --> 31:21.360
I would love to build this statue in Griffin's honor.

31:21.360 --> 31:22.640
I would love to.

31:22.640 --> 31:26.560
He was a very important figure for, insert, important reason here.

31:26.560 --> 31:30.640
But I just don't know that we have the maintenance fees for it right now.

31:30.640 --> 31:33.280
With this, I can say, don't even worry about it.

31:33.280 --> 31:35.840
This is me, and maybe I'm standing up,

31:35.840 --> 31:38.720
maybe I have a piece of pizza in my hand that I also bronzed,

31:38.720 --> 31:40.960
and I'm giving like a hang 10 sign with my other hand.

31:42.640 --> 31:44.320
So kind of a team shooting into the trails past each other.

31:44.320 --> 31:47.840
Maybe a little, maybe a little TMNT, perhaps.

31:47.840 --> 31:49.520
Maybe I have roller skates on.

31:49.520 --> 31:51.360
Maybe the roller skates aren't bronzed.

31:51.920 --> 31:54.080
Well, that's gonna create some tricky feet issues.

31:54.080 --> 31:56.640
Well, that's gonna create some tricky feet issues.

31:58.880 --> 32:02.000
I researched this topic a little bit beforehand,

32:02.720 --> 32:07.360
because I like to bring an expert sort of flair,

32:07.360 --> 32:08.800
I guess you could say, to the show.

32:08.800 --> 32:14.080
And I stumbled on a forum where writers ask about things

32:14.080 --> 32:16.400
that could happen in one of the stories that they're writing,

32:16.400 --> 32:19.760
which is always like, basically the best.

32:19.760 --> 32:20.400
Sure.

32:20.400 --> 32:25.120
And Amy Ashley is in here asking if she can bronze a dead body.

32:26.240 --> 32:28.320
She said, I've seen it done in another book,

32:28.320 --> 32:30.800
but technically those bodies were vampires.

32:31.360 --> 32:33.040
So I think that might have been fudge.

32:33.040 --> 32:34.480
Well, I mean, that, okay.

32:34.480 --> 32:34.880
So she-

32:34.880 --> 32:36.560
Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on.

32:36.560 --> 32:37.920
Wait, let me finish here.

32:37.920 --> 32:41.840
She has a few people saying that you need to make

32:41.840 --> 32:44.960
a wax sculpture out of it and then bronze it.

32:44.960 --> 32:48.080
And someone else says they think that bronze would melt the flesh.

32:48.080 --> 32:51.840
And then Amy actually dips back in four questions down and says,

32:53.120 --> 32:56.720
actually it isn't truly human, it's more of a fish,

32:57.360 --> 32:58.880
a mermaid to be exact.

32:59.680 --> 33:01.760
I would say definitely cold blooded.

33:01.760 --> 33:02.480
Okay.

33:02.480 --> 33:06.480
Well, that is gonna hold up under the pressure of vulcanized metal.

33:07.600 --> 33:08.100
Right.

33:10.400 --> 33:11.920
Is this something that you guys would be,

33:11.920 --> 33:14.240
because we've never talked about like what we want to do

33:14.240 --> 33:17.840
with and to each other when one of us passes away first, Travis?

33:19.840 --> 33:21.920
Well, first and foremost,

33:21.920 --> 33:24.480
I am bothered by the limitations of the question.

33:25.200 --> 33:28.320
I don't understand why I have to wait to be dead to be bronzed.

33:30.320 --> 33:33.280
Are you talking full bronzing or are you talking like a partial Tremaine?

33:34.000 --> 33:35.200
Oh, I'm just saying like,

33:35.920 --> 33:37.520
I feel like it would be very protective

33:37.520 --> 33:40.160
if I could just go like toes to neck.

33:40.160 --> 33:40.720
Okay.

33:40.720 --> 33:42.720
You know, leave my head out there for all the important shit,

33:42.720 --> 33:44.160
but just go toes to neck.

33:44.160 --> 33:45.760
And so then I know I'm bait.

33:45.760 --> 33:47.120
Wait, is bronze bulletproof?

33:48.480 --> 33:50.000
It depends on how thick it is.

33:51.040 --> 33:52.480
I can tell you this though.

33:52.480 --> 33:54.320
It is poop and peep proof.

33:55.920 --> 33:57.520
There's going to be some outlets.

33:57.520 --> 33:58.880
I'm going to need some outlets cut.

33:58.880 --> 33:59.680
Okay.

33:59.680 --> 34:03.600
So basically what we're talking about is like a shitty Iron Man scenario.

34:04.960 --> 34:07.760
I am Iron Man.

34:07.760 --> 34:09.760
I'm fucking falling over.

34:09.760 --> 34:10.240
Shit.

34:10.240 --> 34:11.520
I landed on my dick outlet.

34:11.520 --> 34:14.160
Fuck.

34:14.160 --> 34:14.720
Help me.

34:14.720 --> 34:15.520
Pepper Potts.

34:15.520 --> 34:16.400
Help me.

34:16.400 --> 34:18.480
I peed and pooped in my bronze suit again.

34:19.280 --> 34:20.640
Watch me shoot my beams.

34:20.640 --> 34:21.680
Oh, I don't have beams.

34:21.680 --> 34:22.720
I'm just made of steel.

34:22.720 --> 34:23.200
Fuck me.

34:25.200 --> 34:26.480
Avengers assemble.

34:26.480 --> 34:28.560
I pooped and peed in here a month ago.

34:32.720 --> 34:33.200
Master.

34:33.200 --> 34:34.080
Yes, Jarvis.

34:34.080 --> 34:37.280
You smell like fucking piss on metal and I hate it.

34:37.280 --> 34:37.840
I'm leaving.

34:37.840 --> 34:42.240
I'm an AI and I hate it.

34:42.240 --> 34:46.000
I'm deleting myself because of how bad your pee metal smell smells.

34:49.200 --> 34:52.000
I like that Travis is concerned about it being bulletproof

34:52.000 --> 34:56.000
as if anyone would ever want to shoot a robot.

34:56.000 --> 34:58.560
Travis, you have to worry about it being bulletproof

34:58.560 --> 35:00.400
because I'm saying a week and a half in.

35:00.400 --> 35:02.320
You're going to be like, fucking kill me.

35:03.440 --> 35:03.680
Yeah.

35:04.480 --> 35:05.600
Okay, Justin, I want to jump back.

35:05.600 --> 35:08.480
You're going to turn yourself into a- No, if there's any gun-toting criminal

35:08.480 --> 35:12.000
that walks in because there's a man covered in metal, surely he's a robot.

35:12.640 --> 35:15.760
That man doesn't deserve to be mad at me because he's an idiot.

35:15.760 --> 35:16.640
I am not a robot.

35:16.640 --> 35:17.520
I'm still a human being.

35:17.520 --> 35:19.040
I'm just trapped in a metal husk.

35:19.040 --> 35:19.360
Okay.

35:20.560 --> 35:24.160
And the husk that is becoming my life because of my poor pre-planning.

35:26.240 --> 35:30.080
Why would anyone want to shoot a man that has locked himself

35:30.960 --> 35:33.040
with his dick in butthole hanging out?

35:33.040 --> 35:35.680
How is your flat?

35:35.680 --> 35:38.720
The people can look under and he can't stop them because he can't move his arms.

35:39.920 --> 35:42.480
Please everyone stop looking at my dick and or butthole.

35:42.480 --> 35:45.920
I think they have a name for someone whose limbs are encased in metal

35:45.920 --> 35:48.960
but whose sex organs are exposed and that's a fuck prison.

35:49.520 --> 35:51.600
That's what you set yourself up for.

35:51.600 --> 35:56.960
Travis, can you admit to us right now that this actually sounds like your dream scenario?

35:56.960 --> 36:01.920
All that you have to do is have food fed to you and shit where you stand

36:01.920 --> 36:04.240
and it's totally totally acceptable.

36:04.240 --> 36:07.120
I don't like that you assumed that I would be bronze standing.

36:07.120 --> 36:09.600
Okay, what would your sitch be?

36:09.600 --> 36:10.640
What position are we talking?

36:10.640 --> 36:12.800
Reclining on a chaise lounge like Cleopatra.

36:12.800 --> 36:13.200
Okay.

36:13.200 --> 36:13.440
Okay.

36:14.960 --> 36:18.880
Travis, what if that started out as the life but then you turned

36:19.760 --> 36:24.080
into the grand prize in a high stakes race around the world or something

36:24.080 --> 36:27.120
because that seems like you'd be very valuable.

36:27.120 --> 36:32.160
Or like I sunk to the bottom of the ocean like in AI and then like some aliens found me

36:32.160 --> 36:35.280
in a thousand years but I'm still alive because I didn't have to use a lot of energy to just

36:35.280 --> 36:36.480
keep my head alive.

36:36.480 --> 36:37.360
His love is real.

36:37.360 --> 36:38.240
His intellect is not.

36:38.240 --> 36:43.520
First place for this grand prix around the world is this bronze fuck prisoner.

36:43.520 --> 36:46.160
Like what's second place please?

36:47.040 --> 36:48.640
What's last place get me?

36:48.640 --> 36:50.080
A lead fuck prisoner.

36:50.080 --> 36:56.240
The worst part about being encased in metal and having people have to feed you through

36:56.240 --> 37:01.440
the hole in your face is that you can never really be particular about sandwich orders

37:01.440 --> 37:02.080
again.

37:02.080 --> 37:05.920
You really just have to accept whatever the person brings you.

37:05.920 --> 37:09.200
Egg salad, potato, potato.

37:09.200 --> 37:12.160
Now you hire someone else to smack things out of your mouth for you.

37:13.120 --> 37:14.080
This is disgusting.

37:14.080 --> 37:15.200
Someone scrape it.

37:15.200 --> 37:17.120
Someone scrape the residue from my mouth.

37:18.320 --> 37:22.000
Oh man, this just this turned into a saw movie in my mind real quick.

37:22.720 --> 37:24.560
Yeah, it seems like pretty bad.

37:24.560 --> 37:26.640
Is this what human centipede was about?

37:26.640 --> 37:30.000
Kind of only instead of bronze it was another human's anus.

37:30.800 --> 37:34.480
Did you guys did you guys see the new Robocop?

37:35.120 --> 37:41.280
It was basically just a guy coating himself in metal and having sandwiches in his head

37:41.280 --> 37:44.320
and then pooping himself on Shay's lounge.

37:44.320 --> 37:45.760
Stop that crime.

37:45.760 --> 37:49.360
Hey quit cut that crime out or else I'll make you watch what I do.

37:49.360 --> 37:58.080
That would be a pretty good scene at Robocop halfway through the movie he realized that

37:58.080 --> 38:00.240
his suit is metal and it's too heavy for his bones.

38:01.280 --> 38:08.400
I want you guys to know that also now in 128 episodes I've now learned that this is the

38:08.400 --> 38:14.160
kind of thing that I say this as a joke and someone out there is going Travis is so fucking

38:14.160 --> 38:15.600
dumb that wouldn't work.

38:16.160 --> 38:17.360
That would never work.

38:17.360 --> 38:25.280
Yeah, I can I can say though that after knowing you for almost 30 years well 25 that this

38:25.280 --> 38:28.080
is the kind of thing that you would actually give a lot of thought.

38:29.360 --> 38:30.560
I would research it.

38:30.560 --> 38:35.120
I'm not saying you would do it, but I'm saying out it would occupy a lot of your faculties

38:35.120 --> 38:37.360
for I would say three to four days.

38:38.080 --> 38:42.720
Well because I would also say this in my in my many years of being obsessed with really

38:42.720 --> 38:46.800
weird things that people have done in the past someone has attempted to do this.

38:46.800 --> 38:47.840
Oh sure sure sure.

38:47.840 --> 38:50.160
I mean here's the thing people cryogenically freeze themselves.

38:50.160 --> 38:54.800
You don't think someone back in like the 1600s when people were let's be honest dumb.

38:54.800 --> 38:57.360
Yeah that somebody was like I know how I'll live forever.

38:57.360 --> 39:00.400
I'll be encased in metal when someone like somebody's done it.

39:00.400 --> 39:02.000
Here's the here's the question of the hour.

39:02.000 --> 39:07.040
I die which is never going to happen, but this is this is a you know hypothetical.

39:07.040 --> 39:11.840
I die I get my corpse frozen in bronze.

39:12.400 --> 39:14.240
What do you guys do with that?

39:14.240 --> 39:15.680
What do you do with that?

39:16.160 --> 39:20.400
Do you put that in the independently owned and operated cemetery?

39:20.400 --> 39:23.600
Do you put that in the living room as like some sort of fun statue?

39:23.600 --> 39:26.960
Do you put me in the yard like one of those kind of racist lawn jockeys?

39:27.520 --> 39:32.800
I think that would be a great way to as to act as a seed for your cemetery because people

39:32.800 --> 39:38.000
know you're serious you know I also want to say one body above ground.

39:38.000 --> 39:39.600
That's really good advertising.

39:39.600 --> 39:43.280
It also would be a great moment if you just like had the statue in your home and friends

39:43.280 --> 39:47.360
came over and they were like well that's a really detailed statue and you say oh thank

39:47.360 --> 39:51.760
you it's my brother and they say oh is it like to commemorate him or how did he die

39:51.760 --> 39:58.080
and you're like oh no no no that is my brother that is in fact yeah and p.s a weird person

39:58.080 --> 40:04.800
that's in my house if I have a statue cast in honor of my brother it will not have his

40:04.800 --> 40:10.560
genitals exposed yeah so p.s person with him oh where are you going you don't want to see

40:10.560 --> 40:14.800
the you don't want to talk about my dead brother stat all right I want to you're going to talk

40:14.800 --> 40:19.840
about the Mormon faith I'm ready to listen it would literally be like I wouldn't even

40:19.840 --> 40:24.800
need to see all of it like around as I came through the door frame as soon as I saw like

40:24.800 --> 40:30.240
the bra like the tip of his bronze dead nose I'd be like oh hold on I've got a phone call

40:30.240 --> 40:37.680
in my car in my car phone bye yeah but tip of his dead bronze nose we could play a family

40:37.680 --> 40:41.760
we could play a family feud and have people guess how you're going to end that sentence

40:41.760 --> 40:47.360
and survey would never say nose it would never ever say nose no I've listened to my brother

40:47.360 --> 40:51.440
my brother a few times I'm pretty sure he's not gonna end the sentence with nose let's

40:51.440 --> 40:59.120
go to the leaderboard let's check it out survey says no 100 said dick everyone said dick it

40:59.120 --> 41:04.800
seems 100 you got 100 points Justin this is the worst Louie Anderson impression I've ever heard

41:04.800 --> 41:14.160
let me try again let me try again that's Ray Combs let me try Louie Anderson shut up I'm

41:14.160 --> 41:20.240
trying to do my Louie Anderson wow 100% of the people said dick that's not that's my Bruce

41:20.240 --> 41:26.000
Valanche fuck uh I saw Bruce Valanche on Shark Tank yesterday that son of a bitch was pitching

41:26.000 --> 41:31.200
a software to teach old people how to use internet how to use it how to harness its power

41:31.200 --> 41:36.480
I mean I would want I don't know why creating a book to help illiterates learn to read yeah right

41:36.480 --> 41:42.400
like if I could log into computer classes they seem to be in pretty good shape yeah do you guys

41:42.400 --> 41:46.400
remember when before the jump we were like we've got to move through these questions faster but

41:46.400 --> 41:52.880
right now I'm googling Richard Karn to like make a timely family feud Richard Karn joke and I think

41:52.880 --> 41:57.280
that nice Karn ball mall I think maybe we should move on I have a roommate who's constantly eating

41:57.280 --> 42:03.920
my food he will always eat 99% of something and leave one item left for example he ate most of

42:03.920 --> 42:10.320
my pretzels but left one and ate a full jar of pesto with said pretzels but left a spoonful of

42:10.320 --> 42:16.320
pesto he ate an entire bag of gummy bears but left a single bear I feel petty ask him to stop

42:16.320 --> 42:24.080
eating my groceries but he doesn't do any grocery shopping on his own how how should I deal with

42:24.080 --> 42:29.680
how should I deal with this without sounding like a petty roommate like okay here's the thing

42:29.680 --> 42:36.000
why define what the word petty means to you because eating your shit and doesn't buy his own

42:36.000 --> 42:40.960
shit more more importantly though he's leaving a single element of it left saying now there's

42:40.960 --> 42:47.920
still some for Jeff to enjoy there's one Pringle in this fucking can once you pop you literally

42:47.920 --> 42:53.200
have to stop Jeff because I ate the other 99 Pringles did you know every can of Pringles has

42:53.200 --> 43:00.960
exactly 100 Pringles in it Jeff you're basically living with a bear but worse because at least the

43:00.960 --> 43:06.480
bear is it will eat everything and it will like you just gotta throw it away after a bear is done

43:06.480 --> 43:12.480
with it um but this guy's eating you out of house and home there's no I mean you can't like how far

43:12.480 --> 43:18.000
does this go like he leaves one square of toilet paper that you bought he leaves the core of the

43:18.000 --> 43:24.800
apple I boned I phoned your girlfriend but I stopped right before completion can we set can

43:24.800 --> 43:31.200
we lay out a a dictate to America and the world but mainly America because I don't know what's

43:31.200 --> 43:40.240
going on elsewhere if you cannot afford to live in an apartment by yourself you have to live with

43:40.240 --> 43:49.440
your parents or be homeless you can't no one can live with anyone they are not dating anymore it's

43:49.440 --> 43:55.920
that's simply untenable before this all roommates are awful they're the worst not that's not we

43:55.920 --> 44:02.000
throw away listen Brent Brent will floss was my roommate I love him very deeply we are we are

44:02.000 --> 44:07.200
still best friends and we live together for three years if you ask either one of us like did you at

44:07.200 --> 44:12.880
any one point it 100% enjoy living with each other the answer is no yeah but you don't 100%

44:12.880 --> 44:22.560
enjoy like any person like that that's you're gonna have 100% in I 100% enjoy my wife my girlfriend

44:22.560 --> 44:28.000
I'm saying though like you're gonna have friction with anybody that you live with over something

44:28.000 --> 44:31.680
even if I think the problem is that you don't have friction with the person because then

44:31.680 --> 44:38.400
that that's when the real problems arise what I meant I mean I got that you meant like you don't

44:38.400 --> 44:43.040
want to like fuck you fuck fuck your roommate don't fuck your roommate like first off don't

44:43.040 --> 44:48.240
do that I do think that is an option though I think that's an option is to even if you're

44:48.240 --> 44:53.600
heterosexual and you cannot afford to like you have to live with someone of the same

44:53.600 --> 45:01.760
gender as you I want you to eat this last gummy bear only what it's not in the bag where could it be

45:03.680 --> 45:08.400
can we suggest that like can you do maybe not a sexual relationship I meant like in his butthole

45:08.400 --> 45:13.920
and then like he would have oh gosh okay couldn't you thank you for clearing that up I needed a

45:13.920 --> 45:20.480
road sign to find that one uh what what if you were to just say like we're not in a sexual

45:20.480 --> 45:27.200
relationship but as long as you live here and I live here there is no boundary like we we are

45:27.200 --> 45:33.200
literally we we are in this thing together we are living we are living as a unit I think that that

45:33.200 --> 45:39.600
might be a possible that what like the majority of 80 sitcoms was about I think yeah like perfect

45:39.600 --> 45:45.120
strangers I think was exactly about I don't think the guys in perfect strangers ever fucked each

45:45.120 --> 45:52.880
other no I'm not saying implied I I'm not saying they fuck each other I'm saying like they combine

45:52.880 --> 45:59.280
their bite and their wiener do not to stand tall on the wings of their dreams like they don't have

45:59.280 --> 46:04.880
two milks there's just the one milk and they're both sharing it and if you don't have any groceries

46:04.880 --> 46:12.960
like that that is a problem both of you have listen yeah and and question asker it is not

46:12.960 --> 46:17.440
fucking petty is the worst thing in the world when you come home and you're like oh all I want

46:17.440 --> 46:22.320
is to dive into that bag it's the worst roommate situation in the world okay okay it's not the

46:22.320 --> 46:26.240
worst thing worst roommate situation in the world when like you've been sitting at work and you're

46:26.240 --> 46:30.560
like man I just had the worst day but I bought myself that bag of gummy bears yesterday when I

46:30.560 --> 46:35.680
was shopping for just such an occasion I was gonna dive headfirst in that bag of gummy bears you come

46:35.680 --> 46:43.440
home I'm fucking do you remember that one like just super quick real quick sidebar if you're

46:43.440 --> 46:49.600
in this situation it may be time to consider getting a new job if if the if the highlight

46:49.600 --> 46:56.240
of your day is the gummy bears you're gonna eat later please you might be a redneck yeah time to

46:56.240 --> 47:02.320
go to resume her and start seeing what's available because you are in a bad job I don't know what

47:02.320 --> 47:07.280
kind of posh high level upper management jobs you've had in your life you've never had a job

47:07.280 --> 47:11.520
where the highlight of your day is going to be the fact that you bought yourself like an ice cream

47:11.520 --> 47:17.520
treat uh-huh and then maybe after that maybe you'll kill yourself maybe what so okay Travis

47:17.520 --> 47:21.920
walk me through the narrative here this person goes to the grocery store buys an ice cream

47:21.920 --> 47:27.680
treat says hang tight little buddy I'm gonna talk to you yes I don't know what kind of idealistic

47:27.680 --> 47:31.200
lives you guys have led but sometimes you know you got to buy your bread you got to buy your milk

47:31.200 --> 47:36.800
you got to buy your shit but then you go you know what this box of candy this is just for me when

47:36.800 --> 47:42.080
Travis is in trouble you know this is for this is for emergencies only break glass in case of

47:42.720 --> 47:49.040
blank box of mysterious unlabeled candy what could be inside here it's like Jumanji in candy

47:49.040 --> 47:53.040
form I can't wait to eat this when I get home from the office you guys have never had emergency

47:53.040 --> 48:01.120
treats not that defined the course of my entire day no Travis okay out of out of years out of

48:01.120 --> 48:05.360
years of your like 365 days you've never had one day where you think like oh I've got a steak at

48:05.360 --> 48:09.920
home I'm gonna eat that today I have everything better but then I do I just live like a horrendous

48:09.920 --> 48:15.920
food-based lifestyle you've been grief eating for like a decade I think like it's yeah yeah no that's

48:15.920 --> 48:20.960
not great Trav that is not great behave that's not great that's not ideal I'll have you know

48:20.960 --> 48:24.720
that I met with a personal trainer yesterday and he said my body fat percentage was fair your body

48:24.720 --> 48:32.160
is amazing but my body is a wonder let's just I this is not it sucks but it's not that do you

48:32.160 --> 48:37.200
remember 30 episodes or so ago when the guy talked about how his roommate fucked on his bed and left

48:37.200 --> 48:42.720
like that's the worst left like a love mess whenever he did it like that's one gummy bear

48:42.720 --> 48:48.800
sitting in the middle of the love mess yeah he left his leavings and like that fucked in your

48:48.800 --> 48:53.600
bed and also I ate all but one of your gummy bears his detritus I think that you should count your

48:53.600 --> 48:57.280
count your lucky stars there was enough left there that a bloodhound can track him through

48:57.280 --> 49:02.480
the streets of London let's put it that way let's leave it at that um god yeah god I'm so glad I'd

49:02.480 --> 49:11.440
never have to do that again do you guys want to yahoo please um this yahoo was sent in by uh

49:11.440 --> 49:18.320
Valerie Rogers thank you Valerie it is by yahoo answers user Paul who asks what is the sexiest dog

49:18.320 --> 49:22.960
I sometimes jog in the dog park around the corner from where I live the other day I got talking to

49:22.960 --> 49:28.240
a model who was walking her dachshund said she would like to see me again I told her I walk my

49:28.240 --> 49:34.800
dog there a lot so she would probably bump into me sometimes problem is I don't have a dog I now

49:34.800 --> 49:40.720
have to buy one so she doesn't know I was lying to her so I could maybe get laid I am wondering

49:40.720 --> 49:46.080
what type of dog I should get I want to get the sexiest dog possible so I'm going to go to the

49:46.080 --> 49:51.760
sexiest dog possible so I have the best chance of getting into her pants what kind of dog what do

49:51.760 --> 49:57.440
you dog owners suggest which dog is more likely to drive her crazy having a seizure I also need

49:57.440 --> 50:04.080
one that doesn't make much noise because my wife can't find out she doesn't like dogs ah twist oh

50:04.080 --> 50:08.960
god right there at the end you didn't think I thought it was so bad but now I see it for what

50:08.960 --> 50:16.400
it truly is you got a yahoo chameleon I think it's got to be an afghan hound their hair looks

50:16.400 --> 50:21.920
like a beautiful lady's hair hanging down yeah that's not bad what about something that has

50:21.920 --> 50:28.800
even like a suggestive name like a like a schnauzer you know what I mean because whenever I hear

50:28.800 --> 50:37.440
schnauzer I think of like how a barbit is actually is called a gun dog by the uh by the united kennel

50:37.440 --> 50:43.040
club well I was more thinking of like you could ostensibly refer to your penis as like your

50:43.040 --> 50:46.880
schnauzer you know what I mean why don't you get a human slave dressed as a dog and walking through

50:46.880 --> 50:51.520
the dog park this is good this is a good line of dialogue for us hey and you want to know something

50:51.520 --> 50:57.760
people do that that exists I saw it on an episode on I believe tlc let's let's clear up real quick

50:57.760 --> 51:05.120
though just for a second when you say human slave you're talking about an snm thing and not a literal

51:05.120 --> 51:11.280
slavery on the black market okay no I'm talking snm a bdsm kind of thing okay and uh the person

51:11.280 --> 51:15.600
you know they wear snout and dog ears and whatnot you get them on a leash they crawl on all fours

51:15.600 --> 51:20.720
through the dog park and I don't know whether they use the bathroom like a dog but hey I think

51:20.720 --> 51:25.440
it's safe to assume okay I'm gonna need about 15 minutes to just jerk it real quick can we can we

51:25.440 --> 51:31.760
take a break can we have a brief jerk it recess yeah and then we'll edit that out and we're and

51:31.760 --> 51:39.600
oh got it there was so much hey can I ask a real quick favor from people who are into snm uh you

51:39.600 --> 51:46.400
know I'm into it you know I'm down with you having your lifestyle could you not take that whole scene

51:47.040 --> 51:54.800
into a public forum where that's going to be that person's whole week unless unless

51:54.800 --> 52:04.080
there is a special park that's just don't smell his ass just kidding go for it you have to do it

52:04.080 --> 52:12.000
you're wild the place in which this I saw this occurring it was uh an sm an snm pair in san

52:12.000 --> 52:17.200
francisco well that seems like the kind of place where that would happen yes yes of course I'm

52:17.200 --> 52:22.480
saying maybe this is a special dog park but can you imagine being a regular dog owner which is

52:22.480 --> 52:27.280
like oh a new dog maybe in like the deeps like didn't texas or something like that like oh this

52:27.280 --> 52:33.520
is not a thing that has ever happened in this whole zip code cool cool justin you got real quiet

52:33.520 --> 52:44.160
are you okay I just sometimes it gets the walls you try to put up for yourself you think that

52:44.160 --> 52:50.960
they're to keep we have an agreement I know it's just an inside but it turns out the walls have

52:50.960 --> 52:58.160
been there to keep all this alcohol because maybe just maybe maybe it's your thing it's got to be

52:58.160 --> 53:06.000
somebody's thing what if it's my thing like how much of me guarding myself maybe some of my social

53:06.000 --> 53:11.600
anxiety can be traced back to the fact that I'm constantly worried I'm gonna be like woof let's

53:11.600 --> 53:18.080
fight I need it but we have to we can't let those fears control where we go on this show you know

53:18.080 --> 53:23.040
we have to have this agreement no limits no restraints take this pill let's go down this

53:23.040 --> 53:28.000
sexual oubliette together some some restraints but only if there are streets yeah yeah right

53:28.000 --> 53:32.960
let's go down this hole gotta go one way or the other we have to figure we got this show is a

53:32.960 --> 53:38.480
sexual spirit journey in in more ways than one and when we start pulling back a little bit when

53:38.480 --> 53:42.560
we start holding back the reins do you remember three years ago when we sat down and we started

53:42.560 --> 53:47.280
discussing doing this show and we said we're gonna do this show for one reason and one reason alone

53:47.280 --> 53:57.120
to learn about ourselves sexually come my brother my brother may come listen to three brothers

53:57.120 --> 54:02.880
discover themselves sexually open their flowers to new possibilities you remember when we were

54:02.880 --> 54:08.000
coming up with names to the show and I thought that ito hermano tombi in was gonna be was gonna

54:08.000 --> 54:21.040
be for recently I do think that making this show has skewed my perception of what it of I don't I

54:21.040 --> 54:27.360
do not think I have a barrier for what is a barometer for what is weird I used to think

54:27.360 --> 54:31.680
things are weird nothing's weird do you remember everything is do you remember like a hundred

54:31.680 --> 54:37.760
episodes ago we were like hey furries right and now we're all basically furries now and now I

54:37.760 --> 54:44.160
legit no joke if I hear someone out in real life make fun of the furries I will interject into a

54:44.160 --> 54:48.880
stranger's conversation and be like um excuse me that's actually coming from a very uninformed

54:48.880 --> 54:53.520
place and let me tell you what you need to know about the furry community are we a microcosm of

54:53.520 --> 55:00.080
this experiment called America I hope that the amount of progressiveness that we show on this

55:00.080 --> 55:06.000
show every single episode I think if we can take steps forward like that as a fucking nation then

55:06.000 --> 55:12.160
we are going to turn into like a hellraiser-esque dimension of pain and pleasure I think I think

55:12.160 --> 55:19.760
initially we did have we had a lot of socially accepted bigotry yeah I think when we started

55:19.760 --> 55:24.960
we had a lot of socially acceptable I was not into interracial marriage I was I was firmly

55:27.680 --> 55:33.440
I didn't believe an older person could truly love a younger person now I know we used to be

55:33.440 --> 55:40.560
be the only person we have gotten irrationally angry at and I have not regretted as jugglers

55:40.560 --> 55:47.120
I still feel like we were pretty much on the money with jugglers I want to keep that feud going but

55:47.120 --> 55:54.080
literally everything else I I am sorry for any time we've judged now is that your Appalachian

55:54.080 --> 56:03.280
affectation on the word juggalos hey man you got a festival with a bunch of jugglers around I would

56:03.280 --> 56:11.760
marry my first born daughter to a juggalo before I let her date a juggler wow I want to leave it

56:11.760 --> 56:19.600
at that wow out of my by saying that my my future daughter is going to listen to this and date a

56:19.600 --> 56:26.560
juggler to piss me off god damn it's right it's like we work so hard for you to not date anyone

56:26.560 --> 56:34.480
who suspends balls in the air that's all I ask that's all I ask is to stay away from wizards

56:35.200 --> 56:41.200
and press the digitators and jugglers I don't like anybody who does tricks I don't think it's

56:41.200 --> 56:45.200
so wrong our dad was murdered at a carnival should we have we ever talked about the fact

56:45.200 --> 56:49.920
our dad was murdered at a carnival no I don't think so okay well it's although I would like

56:49.920 --> 56:55.280
to throw out uh a special thanks to our our adopted father uh Clint McElroy which I mean

56:55.280 --> 57:00.720
we adopted him you've done such a great job raising us but the scars of our former dad's

57:00.720 --> 57:06.720
carnival murder unsolved carnival murder I feel like it really informs a lot of the stuff we talk

57:06.720 --> 57:10.720
about on the show I am amazed that like I'm amazed that we've never talked are you sure it hasn't

57:10.720 --> 57:15.840
come up it seems like it would have come up the fact that our dad was killed by a juggler

57:15.840 --> 57:19.120
well we can't prove that he was the prime suspect could have been anybody could have been a bearded

57:19.120 --> 57:23.360
lady could have been the lizard man could have been dunkin booth maybe a knife thrower that

57:23.360 --> 57:29.360
seems accurate could have been oh shit cotton candy guy candy guy last person you ever suspect

57:29.360 --> 57:34.480
he doesn't have any superpowers cotton candy tastes like my dad what spun to death made it

57:34.480 --> 57:41.040
from Emilio um all right uh guess his weight is what's in the show well I was gonna keep

57:41.040 --> 57:46.240
making like carnival carnival okay go ahead I gotta grab a washcloth what's wrong I spilled

57:46.240 --> 57:57.120
some coffee okay um um I was gonna say like guess his weight oh hey girl okay what's up

57:57.120 --> 58:04.560

um thank you everybody to get for continuing to bear with us I know that it gets got a little

58:39.040 --> 58:45.120
weird I guess you could say this week it seemed to me you know what's funny I don't think it did

58:45.120 --> 58:51.040
comparatively I would this one's probably just I don't know I feel like we made people

58:51.040 --> 58:54.240
we made people come face to face with their own mortality probably more than they're comfortable

58:54.240 --> 58:58.960
with yeah and their own sexuality like what other podcasts offers you an ability to look

58:58.960 --> 59:04.000
into the future and both see yourself dead and see yourself in a leather dog costume sex and death

59:04.000 --> 59:09.920
it's the two primal forces of life according to the pilot episode of the wonder years so thank you

nbmbam wisdom it is a twitter feed that only tweets quotes from the show so that's pretty

59:52.160 --> 59:56.640
sometimes when you say the names of people on twitter you say them in like kind of an

59:56.640 --> 01:00:00.400
incomprehensible manner that makes it sound like you're reading off some sort of incantation

01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:08.080
like you're casting some sort of shitty spell I am casting a spell of love uh I want to because
