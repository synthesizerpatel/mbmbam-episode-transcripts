00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.000 --> 00:10.000
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:10.000 --> 00:17.000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

00:17.000 --> 00:20.000
What's up, you cool baby?

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
Here come the McElroys, we've got jokes and bits.

00:24.000 --> 00:28.000
We're gonna give advice and do funny sticks.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
Laughter, it is in store.

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
Come inside and see, it's time to start.

00:33.000 --> 00:41.000
It's my brother, my brother and me.

00:41.000 --> 00:49.000
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother and Me, an advice show for the modern era.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
This is your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

00:51.000 --> 00:55.000
I'm your middle-est brother, big dog, woof woof, canine.

00:55.000 --> 01:01.000
Can I just say, you guys have been making a real meal out of the name introductions lately.

01:01.000 --> 01:06.000
And I feel like it's a bit like, people just want to get to the nut.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
And I feel like you guys are making us sit through a lot of, well just say your name.

01:09.000 --> 01:15.000
Okay, what up dog pound, it's me, your manger's brother, woof woof, Travis, bark bark, McElroy, woof.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
This is Griffin McElroy.

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
See that took like, that was like a three quarters of a second.

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
Well see Griffin, the problem is in the past we've kind of let it get away from us pretty quickly.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
I'm trying to hold onto it at least through January.

01:26.000 --> 01:30.000
Dude, believe me, like I had a whole honorific there for a while, I turned into a dog.

01:30.000 --> 01:35.000
Like I get it, but I think we're grown-ups now, you know, like one of us is 40.

01:35.000 --> 01:41.000
I think that we should be more responsible and serious and less funny.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
Thanks for listening to our podcast.

01:43.000 --> 01:52.000
We hope you're making some effort to just keep it between the navigational beacons, as James would say.

01:52.000 --> 01:56.000
We're back on our regular recording schedule, which is hubris.

01:56.000 --> 02:01.000
You almost have to fucking timecode this episode at this current moment, right?

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
It's Thursday.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
Oh, hold on, somebody's at the door.

02:08.000 --> 02:12.000
Hey boys, it's me from the network.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
Oh no.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
Hi.

02:14.000 --> 02:18.000
It's me, did I have a name?

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
Was it Reggie Big Shot?

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
Reggie Big Shot.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
Something like that.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
That's what we're going with.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
Reggie Big Shot.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
Reggie, you haven't been here in forever.

02:25.000 --> 02:32.000
I know you boys have been doing a good job for us, even putting up numbers, big ratings.

02:32.000 --> 02:37.000
I've been loving it, but now I hear you're in a little bit of a pickle.

02:37.000 --> 02:42.000
Yeah, we're in need of a new theme song, and I want to hear how the search is coming along.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
How's it going?

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
Hey, you guys masking here or what?

02:48.000 --> 02:52.000
No, we have masks and we have masks on our microphones too, just in case.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
Yeah, so the germs don't go through the computer.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
And I also have Norton antivirus.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
Hold on, I got a mask.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
That is a Mike Myers mask.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
Yeah, love it.

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
I love Shrek, Austin Powers.

03:06.000 --> 03:12.000
You would think it would make your nose and mouth look like Mike Myers's nose and mouth, but it's just his whole head on there.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
Yeah.

03:13.000 --> 03:27.000
So, Griffin, I heard on the episode, my guy, Devin, he does all the listening for me, and he said that you did kind of a fakey fake, fakey fake goof song on there.

03:27.000 --> 03:31.000
It's real insofar as that I worked pretty hard on it.

03:31.000 --> 03:39.000
Is it real in the sense that you stole the music from a beloved Mark Mothers bar, still recovering from COVID?

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
Get well soon, Mark.

03:40.000 --> 03:44.000
Did that person write the Rugrats theme song?

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
Yes.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
Okay, yeah, I thought it was fair use.

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
Well, Rugrats is 75 years old.

03:51.000 --> 03:59.000
It's been more than seven years since Rugrats went off the air, so I don't think Claskey Supo is going to come after my hiney.

03:59.000 --> 04:06.000
Well, I wanted to give Trev, you know you're my favorite, you're my baby.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
I do know that.

04:07.000 --> 04:11.000
I tell everybody, I tell them all, I tell Rogan, Carola, all my boys.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on, wait.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
He's my baby.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
Wait, this is news to us.

04:16.000 --> 04:20.000
Listen, don't get hung up on details.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
Is Roman Mars on that?

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
You told us Roman Mars was on this network.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
Is that true?

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
He is like Roman Mars.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
Okay.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
He's a Roman Mars of jugs.

04:30.000 --> 04:35.000
His name is Doug Jupiter.

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
He's the Roman Mars of jugs.

04:38.000 --> 04:46.000
He tells all kinds of great stories about jugs, most of them I've heard, but some are new to me, which is a thrill as a listener.

04:46.000 --> 04:54.000
So some are like classical, almost like a Beowulf story about jugs, but some are new creations that he is writing himself?

04:54.000 --> 04:59.000
Yeah, he freestyles on there, and some of them are more historical.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
Cool.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
I love it all, though.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
It's kind of a tone poem.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
Oh, a tone poem.

05:06.000 --> 05:12.000
It's called 99% Vrooms.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
Okay.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
How do you spell that?

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
What's the other 1% then?

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
There's four O's.

05:16.000 --> 05:20.000
Listen, of all my boys, Travis, you know you're my favorite.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
Well, okay.

05:21.000 --> 05:27.000
And I wanted to, you know, the little one gets a lot of the credit for his talent.

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
Well, I'm always like touching my cheeks and like, I'm a stinker.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
Right.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
Yeah.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
Travis, I wanted to give you kind of a shot at it right now.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
Oh, kind of a shot at doing an intro song, huh?

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
Yeah, theme song.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
I wanted to see what you could come up with, you know, right on the spot.

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
What about like, this is the intro song.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
It is a very long-

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
There's no music?

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
Well, I mean, okay.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
You don't have an instrument like near you?

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
My mouth is God's instrument, Griffin.

05:56.000 --> 06:01.000
Man, the sound of Justin eating, even as a joke, bugs me in a major way.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
He's out of the room.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
I want you to take your-

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
You went to the cramper.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
Griffin, do you have like an egg shaker handy or something you can give me?

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
Yeah, sure.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
Sure, sure, sure.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
Let me start it.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
Egg, egg, egg, egg, egg, egg.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
This is the intro song.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
It is a very long-

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
Egg, egg, egg, egg.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
So that was kind of like an Applebee's Birthday remix.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
Yeah.

06:20.000 --> 06:25.000
Well, I figure people want to get, it leaves us more time for great bits like this.

06:25.000 --> 06:28.000
Are you open to notes or you locked in?

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
I'm actually locked in.

06:29.000 --> 06:33.160
I already mailed it to myself in a sealed envelope

06:33.160 --> 06:34.000
so I could copyright.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.280
Smart, smart cookie.

06:35.280 --> 06:39.800
I could still tweak the fruity loops that I'm working with

06:39.800 --> 06:42.660
if you have any notes on the instrumentation.

06:43.720 --> 06:45.680
Well, it's not the instrumentation

06:45.680 --> 06:47.900
so much as the legality of it, right?

06:47.900 --> 06:49.000
Yeah, yeah.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.520
You remember when there was a period

06:51.520 --> 06:55.620
where you were kind of gingerly ripping off

06:55.620 --> 06:57.880
one of the world's most popular bands

06:57.880 --> 07:02.080
really courting some extreme actions?

07:02.080 --> 07:06.400
Legally speaking, I don't wanna get back into those waters.

07:06.400 --> 07:07.240
Oh, boy.

07:07.240 --> 07:08.080
Where'd you go for a second, Reggie?

07:08.080 --> 07:09.560
Hey, what just happened there?

07:09.560 --> 07:12.960
My gosh, these damn Zooms, hold on.

07:12.960 --> 07:16.080
The microphone made you turn into the movie announcer?

07:16.080 --> 07:18.320
Zoom, the Zoom, the connection.

07:18.320 --> 07:19.540
We're not using Zoom.

07:20.600 --> 07:21.760
Damn Zoom.

07:21.760 --> 07:25.080
I got it open on another tab by kids in school.

07:25.080 --> 07:26.400
You're sharing a computer Oh, that's great,

07:26.400 --> 07:30.040
but your child is in school on the same computer

07:30.040 --> 07:31.640
that you're giving us.

07:31.640 --> 07:33.520
Yeah, I'm in school, what of it?

07:33.520 --> 07:36.080
Oh, boy. Reggie Jr.

07:36.080 --> 07:36.920
What?

07:36.920 --> 07:38.960
Reggie Jr. No, his name is Kathleen.

07:38.960 --> 07:40.240
He's named after his mother.

07:40.240 --> 07:42.160
Oh, a feminine junior.

07:42.160 --> 07:46.560
Hey, listen, Travis's was bad and you know I love him.

07:46.560 --> 07:47.840
You know I love him. He's your favorite.

07:47.840 --> 07:49.080
He's your angel.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.320
Griffin, you wanna try again

07:51.320 --> 07:54.240
or are you just gonna stick with your original deal?

07:54.240 --> 07:55.720
Can I try another one?

07:55.720 --> 07:56.600
Yeah, I love that.

07:56.600 --> 07:58.840
Much better. If you change your mind.

07:58.840 --> 08:01.440
Okay, all right, you see you got into a problem.

08:01.440 --> 08:04.600
Oh, yeah, damn it, there it is, okay.

08:04.600 --> 08:06.920
They are just the McElroys.

08:06.920 --> 08:08.520
They are just the McElroys.

08:08.520 --> 08:11.200
Sorry, I can't even identify what you're.

08:11.200 --> 08:13.880
McElroy brothers, answering questions.

08:13.880 --> 08:16.640
They're the world's most fearsome brother team.

08:16.640 --> 08:20.120
Okay, now I see what's going on here, all right.

08:20.120 --> 08:23.620
Griffin's too cool and Travis does machines.

08:23.620 --> 08:26.580
How are you? You give it up.

08:26.580 --> 08:29.180
Justin's cool but rude.

08:29.180 --> 08:32.300
And so they're all cool, I get that.

08:32.300 --> 08:33.260
Everyone's cool.

08:33.260 --> 08:36.180
And Clint McElroy is the party dude.

08:36.180 --> 08:40.180
Hey, MB, MB, MBAM, MBAM.

08:40.180 --> 08:42.060
We have to add an MB for it to work by the way.

08:42.060 --> 08:47.060
MB, MB, MBAM, MB, MB, MBAM, MB, MB, MBAM.

08:47.860 --> 08:48.700
Yeah, we get it.

08:48.700 --> 08:51.100
It is time for Travis to add Justin Griffin.

08:51.100 --> 08:51.940
Okay.

08:51.940 --> 08:53.740
You put yourself up front, which I love that,

08:53.740 --> 08:54.580
to kill Rinstein.

08:54.580 --> 08:55.820
My song.

08:55.820 --> 08:58.220
Okay, listen, I'm sorry to derail you boys.

08:58.220 --> 08:59.060
I know you're doing your little.

08:59.060 --> 09:00.900
I just made that up off the top of my head.

09:00.900 --> 09:04.660
Doing your show, but you keep working on it, all right?

09:04.660 --> 09:06.300
I'll keep checking in on you.

09:06.300 --> 09:07.700
Cool. I love you, Reggie.

09:07.700 --> 09:10.760
I don't, I think you suck shit, dude.

09:10.760 --> 09:11.680
Hey, he's gone.

09:11.680 --> 09:13.580
Do you think I suck shit?

09:13.580 --> 09:15.540
No, I think that about Reggie.

09:15.540 --> 09:16.460
Let's do a question.

09:16.460 --> 09:17.900
Okay.

09:17.900 --> 09:22.900
I recently discovered a can that had its label removed.

09:23.460 --> 09:25.900
None of my roommates remember its contents

09:25.900 --> 09:28.540
and none of us could tell from its shape or size.

09:28.540 --> 09:30.740
How do I deal with this situation?

09:30.740 --> 09:31.820
Do I open the can

09:31.820 --> 09:34.340
and risk having to dispose of its contents?

09:34.340 --> 09:36.300
Should I just try to forget about it?

09:36.300 --> 09:38.340
That's from Can Conundrum in Canada.

09:38.340 --> 09:39.920
Oh, I got a fix for this.

09:39.920 --> 09:41.260
Open it and eat.

09:41.260 --> 09:42.900
What the fuck's inside?

09:42.900 --> 09:45.060
But Griffin, what if it's like you open it

09:45.060 --> 09:48.500
and it's like a cream of mushroom soup?

09:48.500 --> 09:49.340
And you're like,

09:49.340 --> 09:51.580
I don't want cream of mushroom soup right now.

09:51.580 --> 09:53.740
If I were to just kind of like

09:53.740 --> 09:56.980
draw the Punnett square of options you have.

09:56.980 --> 09:59.860
Don't open the can and don't eat it is one.

09:59.860 --> 10:01.420
And that's the path you're currently following

10:01.420 --> 10:03.900
and it is the most boring path.

10:03.900 --> 10:06.980
And then you have opening the can and not eating it,

10:06.980 --> 10:08.940
which is a fucking waste.

10:08.940 --> 10:11.820
And then you have open the can and eat it,

10:11.820 --> 10:13.700
which is what a hero would do.

10:13.700 --> 10:17.020
And then you have don't open the can and eat it,

10:17.020 --> 10:18.460
which is out there.

10:18.460 --> 10:19.660
That's what a billy goat would do.

10:19.660 --> 10:22.500
That's what a billy goat would do, a cool billy goat.

10:22.500 --> 10:24.700
Let me offer an option.

10:24.700 --> 10:25.940
Yeah.

10:25.940 --> 10:27.020
Well, this is tough now

10:27.020 --> 10:29.180
because people shouldn't be visiting you.

10:29.180 --> 10:30.820
But when people come to visit,

10:30.820 --> 10:34.700
you could offer it like a surprise prize in a game show.

10:34.700 --> 10:35.540
Cool.

10:35.540 --> 10:37.220
Okay, I could give you a slice of pizza

10:37.220 --> 10:40.420
or I could give you what's in the mystery can.

10:41.380 --> 10:42.900
It could be anything in there.

10:42.900 --> 10:44.820
I'll take the pizza.

10:44.820 --> 10:46.020
Is there enough for everybody?

10:46.020 --> 10:46.860
Cause I will take the pizza.

10:46.860 --> 10:49.860
If someone does that to you at their house,

10:49.860 --> 10:54.540
you come and they say, here is a can and you can open it

10:54.540 --> 10:56.340
and maybe you'll eat what's inside.

10:56.340 --> 10:58.300
You know, you don't have to, if you don't want to though.

10:58.300 --> 11:00.900
What is in that exact scenario,

11:00.900 --> 11:02.580
the best thing that you can find in that can?

11:02.580 --> 11:04.740
And don't say like a million dollars

11:04.740 --> 11:09.060
or signed picture of Harrison Ford.

11:09.060 --> 11:11.620
Chef Boyardee mini raviolis.

11:11.620 --> 11:13.100
That's what you're going with?

11:13.100 --> 11:13.940
Yeah.

11:13.940 --> 11:14.980
There's a correct answer to this by the way

11:14.980 --> 11:15.800
and that was not it.

11:15.800 --> 11:16.640
Justin.

11:16.640 --> 11:17.480
Oh.

11:17.480 --> 11:18.300
Enchilada sauce.

11:18.300 --> 11:19.140
Enchilada sauce.

11:19.140 --> 11:21.180
You would want straight enchilada sauce.

11:21.180 --> 11:23.740
I mean, it's not like I want to put a spoon in there

11:23.740 --> 11:24.900
or a straw and go to town.

11:24.900 --> 11:25.940
That's what I'm talking about.

11:25.940 --> 11:27.540
You're gonna put a spoon or a straw in there

11:27.540 --> 11:28.380
and go to town.

11:28.380 --> 11:29.200
Do I get to cook it?

11:29.200 --> 11:30.100
You can heat it up if you want,

11:30.100 --> 11:32.540
but you got to eat it from the can.

11:32.540 --> 11:34.900
Do they make canned gnocchi?

11:34.900 --> 11:36.520
Gnocchi can? Probably.

11:36.520 --> 11:37.360
No can.

11:37.360 --> 11:38.700
They make canned gnocchi?

11:38.700 --> 11:39.580
No can gnocchi.

11:39.580 --> 11:41.940
I could go for a gnocchi.

11:41.940 --> 11:45.500
I would not say no to gnocchi.

11:45.500 --> 11:47.580
Isn't it interesting how the word gnocchi,

11:47.580 --> 11:48.940
you're making one letter silent

11:48.940 --> 11:51.460
and kind of adding an extra letter in there too.

11:51.460 --> 11:52.300
Yeah.

11:52.300 --> 11:54.420
You don't say the G and also add a Y.

11:54.420 --> 11:56.380
You know, Thor's brother gnocchi?

11:56.380 --> 11:57.200
Uh-huh.

11:57.200 --> 11:58.040
Oh, fuck yeah, man.

11:58.040 --> 11:59.540
I'm Loki for gnocchi.

11:59.540 --> 12:00.460
Oh yeah, there we go.

12:00.460 --> 12:01.460
I love that.

12:01.460 --> 12:03.220
Okey dokey gnocchi.

12:04.460 --> 12:06.380
Is it pineapple rings?

12:06.380 --> 12:07.200
I love that shit.

12:07.200 --> 12:08.040
Oh.

12:08.040 --> 12:10.780
Do you empty that out onto a plate or whatever

12:10.780 --> 12:15.740
and it's still in its native can shape?

12:15.740 --> 12:17.700
That rules, man.

12:17.700 --> 12:21.140
Back in April, way, way back in April.

12:21.140 --> 12:24.560
I cannot imagine what's gonna come out of your mouth now.

12:24.560 --> 12:27.420
I was gonna make me a pineapple upside down cake.

12:27.420 --> 12:28.460
Yeah.

12:28.460 --> 12:33.460
And three different grocery stores I went to sold out.

12:34.740 --> 12:36.840
This is when people were clearing shelves of shit.

12:36.840 --> 12:37.680
Right.

12:37.680 --> 12:40.420
It was out of both the rings and crushed pineapple.

12:40.420 --> 12:41.620
Fuck.

12:41.620 --> 12:44.820
And that to me is such a, like, not everything was gone.

12:44.820 --> 12:48.340
There was plenty of stuff left, but somebody,

12:48.340 --> 12:50.880
and I think to this day, I think it's one person

12:50.880 --> 12:52.540
who was like, well, you know what I need.

12:52.540 --> 12:53.500
And maybe it was Griffin.

12:53.500 --> 12:55.340
It started to sound like maybe it was Griffin

12:55.340 --> 12:57.620
just going around my neighborhood supermarkets,

12:57.620 --> 13:00.620
buying all of the canned pineapple rings

13:00.620 --> 13:01.940
and crushed pineapple.

13:01.940 --> 13:03.420
I wouldn't buy a crushed pineapple.

13:03.420 --> 13:04.260
I want the rings.

13:04.260 --> 13:06.180
I want it to keep its beautiful shape.

13:06.180 --> 13:07.020
Mm, I see.

13:07.020 --> 13:08.620
That was a fun game.

13:08.620 --> 13:09.460
Do you want any ah-hoo?

13:09.460 --> 13:10.300
I like that.

13:10.300 --> 13:13.260
Can I suggest one other option for the can?

13:13.260 --> 13:17.460
Can you make a recording of yourself opening the can

13:17.460 --> 13:19.740
and then send us the audio recording of it

13:19.740 --> 13:22.020
just so we can be there sort of virtually with you?

13:22.020 --> 13:23.500
Yeah, for the excitement of it.

13:23.500 --> 13:24.340
Yeah.

13:24.340 --> 13:25.940
If it ain't food, if it ain't food,

13:25.940 --> 13:27.580
no, you know what, just from a legal perspective,

13:27.580 --> 13:30.580
I want to go ahead and say, don't eat what's in the can

13:30.580 --> 13:32.340
from us, your podcast heroes.

13:32.340 --> 13:35.060
You could make this a fun YouTube series.

13:35.060 --> 13:37.300
Like, oh, unboxing is old.

13:37.300 --> 13:39.300
Uncanning is the new shit.

13:39.300 --> 13:41.700
There's people who do that with like MREs.

13:41.700 --> 13:43.380
Have you ever seen any of those?

13:43.380 --> 13:44.540
Yeah.

13:44.540 --> 13:46.820
Hey, here's a yahoo that was sent in by everyone.

13:46.820 --> 13:47.660
Thanks, everyone.

13:47.660 --> 13:50.260
It's anonymous Yansers user,

13:50.260 --> 13:52.820
which is the only thing I'm calling this from now on.

13:52.820 --> 13:53.660
It's Yansers.

13:53.660 --> 13:54.740
It's a Yancer.

13:54.740 --> 13:58.560
This one was a Yancer asked by Yancy who asks,

13:58.560 --> 14:02.880
how do I come clean about a crop circle I did?

14:02.880 --> 14:03.720
Ooh.

14:03.720 --> 14:04.620
Some years ago, I read a post

14:04.620 --> 14:05.760
about how to make a crop circle.

14:05.760 --> 14:08.060
So I tried it out and it worked really well.

14:08.060 --> 14:08.900
Then local news-

14:08.900 --> 14:09.720
I was about to say where,

14:09.720 --> 14:11.260
but the answer is probably WikiHow, right?

14:11.260 --> 14:13.420
I've watched a video about how to make a crop circle.

14:13.420 --> 14:14.260
For sure.

14:14.260 --> 14:15.860
I've never acted on that information.

14:15.860 --> 14:17.040
Sure you haven't.

14:17.040 --> 14:18.580
Then local news reported on it

14:18.580 --> 14:21.060
and also said the farmer lost a lot of money from it,

14:21.060 --> 14:22.500
which I hadn't thought about.

14:22.500 --> 14:23.580
I felt bad.

14:23.580 --> 14:25.300
I felt bad, but I didn't say anything

14:25.300 --> 14:26.500
because I didn't have the money

14:26.500 --> 14:28.100
and don't want to go to jail.

14:28.100 --> 14:30.300
I have the money now and would like to pay him back,

14:30.300 --> 14:32.280
but I still don't want trouble.

14:32.280 --> 14:35.380
And I know he made a lot from people coming to the site

14:35.380 --> 14:37.660
thinking it was aliens and doing tests on the soil

14:37.660 --> 14:39.100
and energy readings and stuff

14:39.100 --> 14:40.880
and buying t-shirts and jewelry.

14:40.880 --> 14:44.240
So maybe he even owes me money?

14:44.240 --> 14:45.080
Not that I-

14:45.080 --> 14:47.220
I don't know about that.

14:47.220 --> 14:50.740
The whole question was about that.

14:50.740 --> 14:53.180
This person was too afraid to say,

14:53.180 --> 14:55.460
I want to come clean about this crop circle I did

14:55.460 --> 15:00.140
so I can get my portion of the revenue,

15:00.140 --> 15:02.000
of the fraud revenue.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.860
Okay, until you got to that last bit,

15:03.860 --> 15:07.640
which is morally questionable to me at best,

15:07.640 --> 15:09.460
I do think that if you're trying to come clean

15:09.460 --> 15:11.260
and pay them back without getting in trouble,

15:11.260 --> 15:13.620
you just want to leave it in a little envelope

15:13.620 --> 15:16.360
that says like, to farmer from aliens,

15:16.360 --> 15:19.500
sorry, we landed our ship here.

15:19.500 --> 15:21.780
Here's some of your earth money.

15:21.780 --> 15:22.620
Yeah.

15:22.620 --> 15:24.940
Sorry that our ship had such a bad-ass

15:24.940 --> 15:27.820
like tribal tattoo design on the bottom of it.

15:27.820 --> 15:31.220
Sorry we left the Punisher logo in your field.

15:31.220 --> 15:34.740
We're just crazy about that guy up here.

15:34.740 --> 15:36.860
We love how he doesn't take shit from anyone.

15:36.860 --> 15:38.940
Sorry about the Deadpool face

15:38.940 --> 15:40.180
we left in your crop circle.

15:40.180 --> 15:41.780
We've been thinking about blowing up the moon

15:41.780 --> 15:43.620
into a Punisher skull face.

15:43.620 --> 15:44.640
Do you like this?

15:44.640 --> 15:46.780
Ask your friends, ask the government

15:46.780 --> 15:47.620
if we can do this, please.

15:47.620 --> 15:48.440
Would you guys be cool with that?

15:48.440 --> 15:50.380
Not the whole moon, just like part of it

15:50.380 --> 15:52.180
so that when you look at it, you're definitely like,

15:52.180 --> 15:53.740
is that the Punisher logo?

15:53.740 --> 15:54.740
Bad-ass.

15:54.740 --> 15:56.020
That's so sweet.

15:56.020 --> 15:57.140
Kicks ass.

15:58.140 --> 15:59.700
He doesn't take shit from anyone.

15:59.700 --> 16:01.160
And neither do you, Earth.

16:01.160 --> 16:02.960
That's why we want to give you this present.

16:02.960 --> 16:05.340
Consider this our Statue of Liberty.

16:05.340 --> 16:06.180
Yeah.

16:06.180 --> 16:08.840
Ma'am, what if they fucking did go up

16:08.840 --> 16:10.640
and zap Punisher face onto the moon,

16:10.640 --> 16:12.620
but they misunderstood and they just put

16:12.620 --> 16:16.140
like Thomas Jane up there or John Berenthal

16:16.140 --> 16:18.660
just like looking back down on us all from the sky?

16:18.660 --> 16:19.500
Will you go for more?

16:19.500 --> 16:20.320
That would be great for his career.

16:20.320 --> 16:22.460
Can you give me one more cinematic Punisher, Griffin?

16:22.460 --> 16:23.300
Come on, baby.

16:23.300 --> 16:24.860
You got this.

16:24.860 --> 16:26.380
Was Dolph Lundgren the Punisher?

16:26.380 --> 16:27.220
There it is.

16:27.220 --> 16:28.340
Yeah, nice.

16:28.340 --> 16:29.180
Yes.

16:29.180 --> 16:30.020
Thank you.

16:30.020 --> 16:30.840
Yeah, put them all up there.

16:30.840 --> 16:31.680
Fuck it.

16:31.680 --> 16:32.520
Just a little bit.

16:32.520 --> 16:34.060
It's on different sections of the moon.

16:34.060 --> 16:36.780
So as it turns, it spins.

16:36.780 --> 16:39.780
Yes, as the moon spins around us.

16:39.780 --> 16:40.620
Does it?

16:40.620 --> 16:43.260
And we see the different beautiful parts of the moon.

16:44.180 --> 16:45.660
This is its way.

16:45.660 --> 16:47.700
You don't know how much the farmer lost, right?

16:47.700 --> 16:49.540
It'd be very easy to leave a fat signed cash.

16:49.540 --> 16:50.380
Or gained.

16:50.380 --> 16:51.900
Or gained.

16:51.900 --> 16:54.140
You could just leave an envelope with a note in it

16:54.140 --> 16:59.140
that says, you owe me 500 of your Earth dollars signed alien.

16:59.220 --> 17:01.100
Okay, you've said this twice now, Travis.

17:01.100 --> 17:04.060
I do not believe aliens would deliver this missive

17:04.060 --> 17:06.460
through the postal system or through an envelope,

17:06.460 --> 17:07.420
or through, you know what I mean?

17:07.420 --> 17:10.340
Like there would be, that we need a cube,

17:10.340 --> 17:13.180
or something, a data cube.

17:13.180 --> 17:14.020
Do you know what I mean?

17:14.020 --> 17:14.860
I don't know how we-

17:14.860 --> 17:19.300
This cube possesses bleep or proleons,

17:19.300 --> 17:20.900
which should be enough to reimburse you.

17:20.900 --> 17:21.820
Yeah.

17:21.820 --> 17:25.540
Your kids are gonna love bleep, bloop, proleons.

17:27.380 --> 17:29.020
Bleep, bloop's a number.

17:29.020 --> 17:29.860
Sorry.

17:31.100 --> 17:32.460
But it's also a noun.

17:32.460 --> 17:34.300
This is the thing about alien language.

17:34.300 --> 17:36.180
We can't expect it to all make sense.

17:36.180 --> 17:37.660
It's complex and beautiful.

17:37.660 --> 17:39.100
Yeah.

17:39.100 --> 17:42.500
What if you send a message to them on one day,

17:42.500 --> 17:44.500
be like, we're gonna drop off the money tomorrow

17:44.500 --> 17:46.060
for what we, the aliens, owe you.

17:46.060 --> 17:47.780
And then the next day you swing by

17:47.780 --> 17:50.980
and you just leave like eight starbursts.

17:50.980 --> 17:52.700
And the farmer's gonna be like,

17:52.700 --> 17:56.300
whoa, starburst is space money.

17:56.300 --> 17:57.140
And then it turns out

17:57.140 --> 17:59.860
that it's all like a big starburst marketing scheme.

17:59.860 --> 18:03.180
What would, I think that it's time to remake E.T.

18:03.180 --> 18:04.020
Okay.

18:04.020 --> 18:06.420
And when Elliot's like, here's some Reese's Pieces,

18:06.420 --> 18:09.100
have E.T. eat them and be like, this tastes like shit.

18:09.100 --> 18:11.220
Do you have any alien candy?

18:11.220 --> 18:12.060
Yeah.

18:12.060 --> 18:13.380
Right, because it's, why would you assume

18:13.380 --> 18:15.820
Reese's Pieces would be universally liked?

18:15.820 --> 18:17.220
Did you say racist pieces?

18:17.220 --> 18:19.100
Racist, racist pieces.

18:19.100 --> 18:20.220
Reese's Pieces.

18:20.220 --> 18:22.820
I like Reese's Pieces,

18:22.820 --> 18:25.380
but my man could have had a nut allergy.

18:25.380 --> 18:26.220
That's true.

18:26.220 --> 18:27.620
He should spit it out and be like,

18:27.620 --> 18:29.580
do you have any sour candy?

18:29.580 --> 18:31.780
Playing with fire, you got any kitty cats?

18:31.780 --> 18:33.020
Cause I just watched Alf

18:33.020 --> 18:35.820
and that shit was funny and appetizing.

18:37.620 --> 18:40.660
You can't just run up and leave some money on his doorstep

18:40.660 --> 18:44.500
because the farmer, all farmers live in areas

18:44.500 --> 18:47.500
where they can patrol their fields at all times.

18:47.500 --> 18:48.340
And they do.

18:48.340 --> 18:49.860
Here's a rule from me to you.

18:49.860 --> 18:53.340
You put it right on the tableau

18:53.340 --> 18:56.940
with the man who sleeps with a machete under his bed

18:56.940 --> 18:57.900
as a fool every night.

18:57.900 --> 19:00.980
But one, you can put this right there next to it.

19:00.980 --> 19:03.620
You can't sneak up on a farmer.

19:03.620 --> 19:04.460
Oh.

19:04.460 --> 19:05.860
This is proven.

19:05.860 --> 19:08.780
They have long, flat stretches of land.

19:08.780 --> 19:12.340
They're on the lookout for predators such as yourself.

19:12.340 --> 19:13.180
Yeah.

19:13.180 --> 19:14.260
Come after a livestock.

19:14.260 --> 19:17.180
You cannot sneak up on a predator, impossible.

19:17.180 --> 19:19.180
Can't sneak up on, they can't sneak up on a predator.

19:19.180 --> 19:20.020
That's for sure.

19:20.020 --> 19:22.300
Absolutely, there's heat tracking technology there.

19:22.300 --> 19:24.100
But you can't sneak up on a farmer.

19:24.100 --> 19:25.260
There's a caveat though, Justin.

19:25.260 --> 19:28.740
You can't sneak up on a farmer in his home.

19:28.740 --> 19:31.500
That's why you gotta get him at the general store.

19:31.500 --> 19:32.340
Okay.

19:32.340 --> 19:35.180
You got shelves around, there's like tools on the wall.

19:35.180 --> 19:37.340
He is distracted by things.

19:37.340 --> 19:38.620
That's where you're gonna get him.

19:38.620 --> 19:40.660
And also your whole shit falls apart

19:40.660 --> 19:43.940
when you think about it's corn,

19:43.940 --> 19:47.380
which is the hiding place crop.

19:47.380 --> 19:50.100
Corn is, when you plant corn,

19:50.100 --> 19:53.900
you are giving up your ability to like

19:53.900 --> 19:55.380
really keep tabs on your shit.

19:55.380 --> 19:56.620
When you plant corn, you're saying like,

19:56.620 --> 19:58.860
I can't wait to get that good corn money.

19:58.860 --> 20:02.820
But there could be a living scarecrow.

20:02.820 --> 20:04.700
There could be-

20:04.700 --> 20:05.540
Children.

20:05.540 --> 20:06.380
Children, there could be-

20:06.380 --> 20:08.700
Or just drivers who like veer off the road

20:08.700 --> 20:10.940
cause they thought they saw a ghost and drive into it.

20:10.940 --> 20:11.780
That happens a lot.

20:11.780 --> 20:13.780
That happens every single minute.

20:13.780 --> 20:15.340
I've watched a lot of Supernatural

20:15.340 --> 20:18.380
in every other episode, someone's driving into a cornfield.

20:18.380 --> 20:19.220
They crash into corn.

20:19.220 --> 20:22.060
Now that's why I, when I become a farmer,

20:22.060 --> 20:25.260
I'm only gonna do little crops.

20:25.260 --> 20:26.100
Oh, I like that.

20:26.100 --> 20:27.140
No one can hide in a bunch of-

20:27.140 --> 20:27.980
You know what I like?

20:27.980 --> 20:30.540
The idea of you put potatoes and they go under.

20:30.540 --> 20:31.940
You could keep the rest of it level.

20:31.940 --> 20:32.780
I would love to do-

20:32.780 --> 20:34.380
You haven't grown shit, Farmer Travis.

20:34.380 --> 20:37.260
That's me on my potato farm looking out of the window

20:37.260 --> 20:40.540
and there's just like a little naked green man

20:40.540 --> 20:43.340
like glowing in like a hundred feet from my house.

20:43.340 --> 20:45.660
And I'm like, I see, they're taters, dude.

20:45.660 --> 20:47.460
I see you.

20:47.460 --> 20:50.340
He's just carefully folding tater leaves together.

20:50.340 --> 20:51.180
Yeah.

20:51.180 --> 20:52.020
That's nothing.

20:52.020 --> 20:52.940
That's nothing.

20:52.940 --> 20:54.740
That's nothing, beep blork.

20:54.740 --> 20:56.020
Bleep blork's a number.

20:56.020 --> 20:56.860
Okay.

20:56.860 --> 20:57.700
No, I'm sorry, Justin.

20:57.700 --> 20:59.500
Beep blork is my son.

20:59.500 --> 21:00.340
Yeah.

21:00.340 --> 21:01.380
Okay.

21:01.380 --> 21:02.500
No, we need to go to the money zone.

21:02.500 --> 21:03.740
We don't have time for another question right now,

21:03.740 --> 21:06.020
but we'll come right back and do more

21:06.020 --> 21:08.860
of all the great stuff that you've been enjoying.

21:08.860 --> 21:11.540
But first we're going to take a brief sojourn

21:11.540 --> 21:13.500
straight on over to the money zone.

21:13.500 --> 21:14.500
It is I, beep blork.

21:14.500 --> 21:19.500
I heard you were talking about aliens.

21:38.780 --> 21:41.260
I've actually been thinking about

21:41.260 --> 21:42.940
how I need to do more character work.

21:42.940 --> 21:44.540
This is not character work.

21:44.540 --> 21:45.820
This is my life.

21:45.820 --> 21:47.180
I've actually been thinking a lot about

21:47.180 --> 21:50.420
how we should be doing jokes this one episode

21:50.420 --> 21:53.060
after we did those very same jokes.

21:53.060 --> 21:54.560
This is not a joke.

21:54.560 --> 21:58.860
I'm the new sponsor of my brother, my brother and me.

21:58.860 --> 22:00.540
I'm not, I don't even think that this is what

22:00.540 --> 22:02.460
you sounded like last time, Bleep Blorp.

22:02.460 --> 22:04.580
I've had work done.

22:04.580 --> 22:06.420
On your voice?

22:06.420 --> 22:07.500
Yep.

22:07.500 --> 22:09.240
You don't know about alien shit.

22:09.240 --> 22:12.480
It's true, that's why it's alien.

22:12.480 --> 22:14.320
You got me actually there.

22:14.320 --> 22:18.480
I want to tell you about Squarespace.

22:18.480 --> 22:20.160
Then go right ahead, partner.

22:20.160 --> 22:23.920
Your human show, my brother, my brother and me

22:23.920 --> 22:26.520
is sponsored by Squarespace.

22:26.520 --> 22:29.800
You humans still use the internet.

22:29.800 --> 22:31.260
Correct?

22:31.260 --> 22:32.160
Yeah, we do.

22:32.160 --> 22:33.960
You need to evolve your shit.

22:33.960 --> 22:35.560
It's bad.

22:35.560 --> 22:36.680
The internet is?

22:36.680 --> 22:39.900
It makes you sad, and it's hard to make websites.

22:40.760 --> 22:43.360
Except with Squarespace.

22:43.360 --> 22:47.100
So you know we already have access to Squarespace, so.

22:47.100 --> 22:48.320
Like you know that.

22:48.320 --> 22:51.400
Yeah, I mean, yeah, I'm reading the copy here, bro.

22:51.400 --> 22:53.480
Yeah, but it's embarrassing like it's not broken.

22:53.480 --> 22:55.480
Like you know we have a way to do it well.

22:55.480 --> 22:57.900
You're not bringing us this tech.

22:57.900 --> 22:59.520
But Squarespace is the next.

22:59.520 --> 23:01.400
Hey, just talk about all your boobs again, man.

23:01.400 --> 23:03.360
That's what we liked last time.

23:03.360 --> 23:05.000
I got four boobs.

23:05.000 --> 23:08.000
Yeah, stop all the time, he said it, he said it.

23:08.000 --> 23:11.060
Yeah, he said it, yes.

23:11.060 --> 23:12.800
Okay, now you guys talk about Squarespace.

23:12.800 --> 23:14.280
I'm too bummed out.

23:14.280 --> 23:17.000
Please, Squarespace, demand to make good and free us.

23:17.000 --> 23:19.240
No, Squarespace, we're gonna get through this one together.

23:19.240 --> 23:21.320
With Squarespace, you can showcase your work

23:21.320 --> 23:23.860
and sell products and services of all kinds

23:23.860 --> 23:25.880
and promote your physical or online business.

23:25.880 --> 23:28.760
I got a business and it's called Embarrassing Aliens

23:28.760 --> 23:29.920
for Not Being Funny.

23:29.920 --> 23:31.760
You're embarrassed, fuck off.

23:31.760 --> 23:33.840
So they have beautiful, customizable templates

23:33.840 --> 23:35.280
created by world-class designers

23:35.280 --> 23:38.200
and everything's optimized for mobile right out of the box

23:38.200 --> 23:41.440
if you want to put it over your baby's crib, I guess.

23:41.440 --> 23:44.400
And they have analytics to help you grow in real time

23:44.400 --> 23:46.360
and they have free and secure hosting

23:46.360 --> 23:49.880
so you don't have to worry about, you know,

23:49.880 --> 23:52.800
the thieves getting into your website.

23:52.800 --> 23:54.720
And they also have nothing to patch or upgrade ever.

23:54.720 --> 23:56.480
Anyway, go to squarespace.com slash my brother

23:56.480 --> 23:58.040

23:58.040 --> 23:59.960

23:59.960 --> 24:02.920

24:02.920 --> 24:05.640
Now in the space between ads, Bleak Bork.

24:05.640 --> 24:06.480
If you have-

24:06.480 --> 24:07.400
Hey, is this Reggie Bigshot?

24:07.400 --> 24:09.180
Yes, this is Bleak Bork.

24:09.180 --> 24:10.020
Oh shit, he's calling Reggie.

24:10.020 --> 24:11.400
Yes, I tried to help them out.

24:11.400 --> 24:14.960
Just like you said, they were real assholes.

24:14.960 --> 24:16.680
Real fuckers about it.

24:16.680 --> 24:18.200
I didn't know Reggie liked him.

24:18.200 --> 24:20.080
You should cancel their show.

24:20.080 --> 24:20.920
Oh no.

24:20.920 --> 24:24.920
Yes, give Doug Jupiter more time to talk about my bazooms.

24:24.920 --> 24:26.160
He only likes Doug Jupiter

24:26.160 --> 24:28.360
because he talks about his miraculous bazooms.

24:28.360 --> 24:29.380
Yes, all four of them.

24:29.380 --> 24:30.220
Fuck.

24:30.220 --> 24:34.480
Yes, yes, Donatello, Raphael, Leonardo, and Donatello.

24:34.480 --> 24:37.160
After the damn Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

24:37.160 --> 24:39.240
That was like half a callback, Bleak Bork.

24:39.240 --> 24:41.160
You are comedy poison.

24:41.160 --> 24:43.320
Okay, I love you too.

24:43.320 --> 24:44.160
Bye.

24:45.840 --> 24:48.400
Hey guys, Bleak Bork just left.

24:48.400 --> 24:49.880
He looked really hurt.

24:49.880 --> 24:52.200
Travis, will you do this Warby Parker ad?

24:52.200 --> 24:53.040
This is important.

24:53.040 --> 24:54.320
Hurt like physically?

24:55.520 --> 24:57.520
Well, he was crying and it looked like blood,

24:57.520 --> 24:59.400
but it might just have been alien tears.

24:59.400 --> 25:00.860
Yeah, who knows?

25:00.860 --> 25:02.220
Listen, I have perfect eyes

25:02.220 --> 25:03.060
and I shouldn't have to do this one.

25:03.060 --> 25:03.960
Okay, I'll talk about it.

25:03.960 --> 25:05.920
Warby Parker is committed to providing

25:05.920 --> 25:08.280
exceptional vision care online and in stores,

25:08.280 --> 25:10.740
offering eyeglasses, sunglasses, eye exams,

25:10.740 --> 25:12.240
and contact lenses.

25:12.240 --> 25:15.720
Glasses start at $95, including prescription lenses,

25:15.720 --> 25:17.160
sunglasses, progressives,

25:17.160 --> 25:19.040
and blue light lenses are also available.

25:19.040 --> 25:22.080
I am currently wearing a pair of Warby Parker.

25:22.080 --> 25:25.060
I have, at this point, several pairs of Warby Parkers.

25:25.060 --> 25:26.080
I enjoy all of them.

25:26.080 --> 25:28.080
I get compliments on them left and right.

25:28.080 --> 25:31.920
They're comfortable enough to fit my giant face.

25:31.920 --> 25:34.200
And you can do the home try-on kit,

25:34.200 --> 25:39.080
which I like because not every glasses fits my giant face.

25:39.080 --> 25:42.200
So they send them to me after I take a quiz.

25:42.200 --> 25:45.720
You take the quiz, you order a home try-on kit,

25:45.720 --> 25:48.160
and you get to try them on and make sure that they fit you.

25:48.160 --> 25:49.480
Then you send them home.

25:50.600 --> 25:51.440
It's incredible.

25:51.440 --> 25:53.240
I love it very much.

25:53.240 --> 25:54.360
Everyone should try it.

25:54.360 --> 25:56.580
It has changed the way I do glasses.

25:56.580 --> 25:58.200
Not just because of the price,

25:58.200 --> 26:01.380
but because they're fashionable and stylish.

26:01.380 --> 26:02.600
It's so easy.

26:02.600 --> 26:03.680
Everybody has to do it.

26:03.680 --> 26:06.600
Just try Warby Parker's free home try-on program.

26:17.380 --> 26:19.020

26:19.020 --> 26:20.780

Do you think that that was enough

26:33.440 --> 26:37.640
for Juice Jazz the clown to get his own Wikipedia entry?

26:37.640 --> 26:38.480
Probably.

26:38.480 --> 26:39.300
Okay.

26:42.640 --> 26:45.800
Welcome back to Fireside Chat on KMAX.

26:45.800 --> 26:47.600
With me in studio to take your calls

26:47.600 --> 26:50.120
is the dopest duo on the West Coast,

26:50.120 --> 26:52.720
Oliver Wong and Morgan Rhodes.

26:52.720 --> 26:53.920
Go ahead, caller.

26:53.920 --> 26:56.280
Hey, I'm looking for a music podcast

26:56.280 --> 26:58.040
that's insightful and thoughtful,

26:58.040 --> 27:00.080
but also helps me discover artists

27:00.080 --> 27:01.520
and albums that I've never heard of.

27:01.520 --> 27:02.360
Yeah, man.

27:02.360 --> 27:04.400
Sounds like you need to listen to Heat Rocks every week.

27:04.400 --> 27:07.120
Myself and I'm Morgan Rhodes, and my co-host here,

27:07.120 --> 27:09.680
Oliver Wong, talk to influential guests

27:09.680 --> 27:13.120
about a canonical album that has changed their lives.

27:13.120 --> 27:15.400
Guests like Moby, Open Mike Eagle,

27:15.400 --> 27:17.840
talk about albums by Prince, Joni Mitchell,

27:17.840 --> 27:19.240
and so much more.

27:19.240 --> 27:21.200
Yo, what's that show called again?

27:21.200 --> 27:24.040
Heat Rocks, deep dives into hot records.

27:24.040 --> 27:26.240
Every Thursday on Maximum Fun.

27:34.240 --> 27:35.520
You left us hanging there for a while.

27:35.520 --> 27:36.360
I was scared.

27:36.360 --> 27:37.320
Can I ask you guys a question?

27:37.320 --> 27:39.200
I feel like I don't, I'm honestly,

27:39.200 --> 27:40.080
leave this in the show,

27:40.080 --> 27:43.760
but do you feel like I have overextended myself?

27:43.760 --> 27:47.700
I don't want to like capitalize too much of the show.

27:47.700 --> 27:51.520
And I know I did my stupid Big Shot guy bit,

27:51.520 --> 27:52.360
and I don't want to like-

27:52.360 --> 27:53.800
Well, how good is this one squad, Justin?

27:53.800 --> 27:56.140
Is it better than Reggie Big Shot bit?

27:56.140 --> 27:57.040
Look within yourself.

27:57.040 --> 27:58.880
How did you feel like Reggie Big Shot bit?

27:58.880 --> 28:00.560
Pretty good.

28:00.560 --> 28:02.160
Yeah, I thought it was okay.

28:03.240 --> 28:06.640
I just, I brought Beat Blur, Heat, and you know-

28:06.640 --> 28:08.560
Yeah, a few times, Travis did that a few times,

28:08.560 --> 28:10.160
so I think you are owed.

28:10.160 --> 28:11.160
And then maybe I'll just talk

28:11.160 --> 28:12.840
for the last 15 minutes or so.

28:12.840 --> 28:14.880
Yeah, Griffin, if you want to do just like a monologue

28:14.880 --> 28:16.360
about, I don't know, whatever you want,

28:16.360 --> 28:18.880
I mean, you could do some of your audition monologues.

28:18.880 --> 28:19.720
Yeah, I'll do that. You have that one

28:19.720 --> 28:21.700
from Cat on a Hot Tin Roof that I love.

28:21.700 --> 28:24.760
Yeah, the one that's like,

28:24.760 --> 28:26.260
Meow, ouch.

28:26.260 --> 28:27.600
Yep, that one.

28:27.600 --> 28:28.440
Meowch.

28:28.440 --> 28:30.240
Oh, my pawsies.

28:30.240 --> 28:33.120
No, that's your Meowth audition monologue.

28:33.120 --> 28:35.520
It's the same monologue, Travis.

28:35.520 --> 28:36.840
This one has an audio component.

28:36.840 --> 28:38.240
It is one minute long.

28:38.240 --> 28:39.840
Oh boy.

28:39.840 --> 28:42.520
And this is a Taco Bell tweet,

28:42.520 --> 28:44.200
and I'm going to fill in some of the blanks after this,

28:44.200 --> 28:47.160
but Taco Bell put out a video.

28:47.160 --> 28:49.920
It said, and now an announcement from our CEO.

28:49.920 --> 28:52.720
Here are the things you need to know about this.

28:52.720 --> 28:55.420
It is being spoken by an animated potato.

28:55.420 --> 28:56.260
Oh boy.

28:56.260 --> 28:57.660
And now we take you live.

28:57.660 --> 29:00.400
Do not react or the audio will be ruined.

29:02.680 --> 29:03.520
Hi, everyone.

29:03.520 --> 29:06.580
I'm Mark King, CEO of Taco Bell.

29:06.580 --> 29:08.840
And we have some big news today.

29:08.840 --> 29:11.920
As you might've guessed, it has to do with potatoes.

29:11.920 --> 29:13.200
But let's start from the beginning.

29:13.200 --> 29:15.960
Last year, we had to shift entirely to drive-through,

29:15.960 --> 29:18.280
which created longer lines for our customers

29:18.280 --> 29:20.860
and way more demand on our team members.

29:20.860 --> 29:22.840
So in order to create a better experience

29:22.840 --> 29:25.560
for both you and our teams, we had to simplify our menu.

29:25.560 --> 29:28.680
And unfortunately, removing potatoes was part of that,

29:28.680 --> 29:31.440
but it's a new year with new possibilities.

29:31.440 --> 29:32.680
And you know what?

29:32.680 --> 29:34.200
We're bringing them back.

29:35.120 --> 29:35.960
That's right.

29:35.960 --> 29:37.400
As of March 11th,

29:37.400 --> 29:40.400
potatoes are officially back at Taco Bell.

29:40.400 --> 29:42.920
Give us a minute to get them back to most restaurants,

29:42.920 --> 29:45.620
but know that we're working hard to make things right.

29:45.620 --> 29:48.380
And since you're still watching this potato speak,

29:48.380 --> 29:49.760
I'll let you in on a little secret.

29:49.760 --> 29:53.160
This year, we're going big on our vegetarian menu.

29:53.160 --> 29:55.920
We're going above and beyond.

29:57.040 --> 29:58.880
Anyways, that's all I got.

29:58.880 --> 30:00.240
Later, taters.

30:02.240 --> 30:04.800
Oh my fuck, Justin, there's so much to unpack.

30:04.800 --> 30:07.240
When you do that and we're not allowed to react,

30:07.240 --> 30:09.280
do you know how torturous that is?

30:09.280 --> 30:10.680
I know it pains you.

30:10.680 --> 30:11.520
I know it pains you.

30:11.520 --> 30:13.520
So very much.

30:13.520 --> 30:14.440
What struck you, Trav?

30:14.440 --> 30:16.080
What do you wanna touch on first?

30:16.080 --> 30:17.920
Okay, Justin, a couple of things.

30:17.920 --> 30:21.440
One, that it's gonna take them three months

30:21.440 --> 30:24.640
to get some potatoes to Taco Bell's.

30:24.640 --> 30:27.280
That's not what's happening in this.

30:27.280 --> 30:30.480
He said, give us some time to get potatoes to our stores.

30:30.480 --> 30:34.640
He doesn't need the time to get the potatoes to the stores.

30:34.640 --> 30:36.760
He's saying that even at March 11th,

30:36.760 --> 30:38.480
you may not see the potatoes.

30:38.480 --> 30:39.680
What is March 11th?

30:39.680 --> 30:41.600
Okay, I'm gonna walk you in on this

30:41.600 --> 30:43.960
because I literally need everyone to understand

30:43.960 --> 30:46.120
the context of this message that you just heard.

30:46.120 --> 30:51.120
Okay, COVID-19 took potatoes out of Taco Bell, right?

30:54.760 --> 30:59.760
What this potato is saying is that hopefully

31:00.600 --> 31:04.120
with expedient vaccination rates,

31:04.120 --> 31:10.120
we will be able to expedite our processes within Taco Bell

31:10.400 --> 31:13.680
in order to reintroduce potatoes to the menu.

31:13.680 --> 31:16.560
Thank you, Dr. Fauci, for bringing back potatoes

31:16.560 --> 31:17.400
to the menu at Taco Bell.

31:17.400 --> 31:19.320
That was a direct quote from Dr. Fauci.

31:19.320 --> 31:20.960
We're doing the best we can.

31:20.960 --> 31:22.880
We're trying to get potatoes back, everybody.

31:22.880 --> 31:23.920
We know this was rough.

31:23.920 --> 31:26.480
Also, just say beyond meat.

31:26.480 --> 31:30.040
At that point, you've already said it all.

31:30.040 --> 31:30.880
Yeah, is that the season?

31:30.880 --> 31:31.720
No, it's a wink.

31:31.720 --> 31:32.560
He did a wink.

31:32.560 --> 31:33.800
I get, yes, Justin.

31:33.800 --> 31:34.760
I picked up on that

31:34.760 --> 31:37.200
because it was the classic wink sound effect.

31:37.200 --> 31:39.360
Now, tell me more about this animated potato.

31:39.360 --> 31:41.520
Are we talking about pure veggie tale synergy

31:41.520 --> 31:42.920
or are we talking about-

31:42.920 --> 31:45.040
Yeah, how fuckable is this potato?

31:45.040 --> 31:47.520
It's like Zoom filter,

31:47.520 --> 31:49.960
sorry, Instagram Snapchat filter levels.

31:49.960 --> 31:50.800
You know what I mean?

31:50.800 --> 31:52.600
Where it's got weird eyes and-

31:52.600 --> 31:55.240
Okay, so just say very fuckable.

31:55.240 --> 31:56.360
Extremely fuckable.

31:56.360 --> 31:59.160
I mean, there's holes that would work.

32:00.360 --> 32:03.400
So Taco Bell is bringing back potatoes.

32:03.400 --> 32:05.480
Bringing potatoes back.

32:05.480 --> 32:06.320
Are you ready?

32:07.560 --> 32:09.480
Now, here's one question for you.

32:09.480 --> 32:12.600
Why did they feel the need to give us two months heads up?

32:12.600 --> 32:13.440
Good question.

32:13.440 --> 32:14.280
I don't know what...

32:14.280 --> 32:15.360
I was gonna leave the country,

32:15.360 --> 32:18.880
but now I'll stay in the country for this.

32:18.880 --> 32:20.720
I like that even within the video,

32:20.720 --> 32:21.640
they acknowledge like,

32:21.640 --> 32:24.280
we're surprised you're still watching this.

32:24.280 --> 32:25.400
Like they even said like,

32:25.400 --> 32:26.880
well, I guess because you're still here,

32:26.880 --> 32:27.960
we should tell you something else

32:27.960 --> 32:32.800
as a reward for watching this bonkers ass thing.

32:32.800 --> 32:36.160
I love that it's not even a menu item.

32:36.160 --> 32:38.360
The object potato.

32:38.360 --> 32:40.040
We have brought back potatoes.

32:40.040 --> 32:42.200
It will be present in our buildings again,

32:42.200 --> 32:44.120
and we will be cooking them.

32:44.120 --> 32:46.080
You have my guarantee on that,

32:46.080 --> 32:48.120
miss me, Mr. Mark King.

32:48.120 --> 32:52.200
We need some time to get potatoes back into the stores.

32:52.200 --> 32:56.720
Hey bud, I can't think of a Taco Bell on the earth

32:56.720 --> 32:59.120
you can't spit on a Walmart from the parking lot.

32:59.120 --> 33:02.400
I am pretty sure that they could just go get some potatoes.

33:02.400 --> 33:05.800
Just go get some and make the stuff.

33:05.800 --> 33:07.480
Okay, here's the press release.

33:07.480 --> 33:09.360
The brand is kicking the year off

33:09.360 --> 33:11.320
with the return of potatoes

33:11.320 --> 33:14.920
and exploring a new plant-based protein with Beyond Meat.

33:14.920 --> 33:15.760
Potatoes.

33:15.760 --> 33:16.600
So they just came around.

33:16.600 --> 33:17.440
Okay.

33:17.440 --> 33:18.280
There it is.

33:18.280 --> 33:20.960
They're making potato beef.

33:20.960 --> 33:22.000
Their prayers have been answered.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
After a brief hiatus from menus

33:24.000 --> 33:28.560
due to Taco Bell's menu simplification efforts last year,

33:28.560 --> 33:32.800
Cheesy Fiesta Potatoes and the spicy Potato Soft Taco

33:32.800 --> 33:35.360
will be back starting March 11th.

33:35.360 --> 33:37.360
Taco Bell's also teaming up with Beyond Meat

33:37.360 --> 33:40.240
to create an innovative new plant-based protein

33:40.240 --> 33:42.400
that will be tested in the next year.

33:42.400 --> 33:44.200
Taco Bell chose to team up with Beyond Meat

33:44.200 --> 33:47.160
as a category leader, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

33:47.160 --> 33:49.640
The return of our beloved potatoes

33:49.640 --> 33:51.640
is just the first step in showing our fans.

33:51.640 --> 33:54.400
Oh, you love potatoes so much, huh Mark?

33:54.400 --> 33:55.240
Huh Mark?

33:55.240 --> 33:56.080
Well, it seems like you turned your back on them.

33:56.080 --> 33:56.920
This is Liz Matthews,

33:56.920 --> 33:59.760
Taco Bell's Global Chief Food Innovation Officer.

33:59.760 --> 34:00.600
Dummy.

34:00.600 --> 34:02.600
You couldn't tell that just from the word choice.

34:02.600 --> 34:03.440
Come on.

34:03.440 --> 34:05.240
This is classic Liz.

34:05.240 --> 34:08.160
Return of our beloved potatoes is just the first step

34:08.160 --> 34:10.680
in showing our fans the strong continued commitment

34:10.680 --> 34:13.880
to vegetarian we're making this year, says Liz Matthews,

34:13.880 --> 34:16.160
Taco Bell's Global Chief Food Innovation Officer.

34:16.160 --> 34:19.640
Hey Liz, weird to talk about your commitment to that

34:19.640 --> 34:20.800
when you were like,

34:20.800 --> 34:23.760
well, let's just not do it for the rest of 2020.

34:23.760 --> 34:26.280
We have had, Travis, it was COVID.

34:26.280 --> 34:29.760
We have long been a leader in the vegetarian space,

34:29.760 --> 34:31.760
but this year we'll have more meatless options

34:31.760 --> 34:34.600
in the story of the vegetarians, Veggie Curious.

34:34.600 --> 34:35.440
Ooh.

34:35.440 --> 34:36.840
And even meat eaters will love.

34:36.840 --> 34:38.320
Tell me more about this veggie.

34:38.320 --> 34:39.800
Oh, I've heard about these.

34:39.800 --> 34:41.440
Veggie tables?

34:41.440 --> 34:43.280
You say this is a pepper?

34:43.280 --> 34:46.720
Is like a, it's like a crispy green chicken.

34:46.720 --> 34:47.560
I love it.

34:48.440 --> 34:51.400
I love the, do you call it cabbage?

34:51.400 --> 34:56.000
It's like, it's kind of like when I slice up frozen beef

34:56.000 --> 34:56.840
really thin.

34:56.840 --> 34:58.800
Can I have the asparagus?

35:00.360 --> 35:01.200
Two of them?

35:01.200 --> 35:02.600
I've been curious about these.

35:02.600 --> 35:04.520
I believe it's pronounced tamatis.

35:04.520 --> 35:05.640
Tamatis, is that correct?

35:05.640 --> 35:06.480
Tamatis.

35:06.480 --> 35:07.320
Isn't that fun?

35:07.320 --> 35:10.160
Prepare the asparagus in the traditional style, I guess.

35:11.600 --> 35:14.560
Excuse me, my hamburger is not done.

35:14.560 --> 35:15.400
What's that?

35:15.400 --> 35:17.200
This is coleslaw.

35:17.200 --> 35:18.040
Okay.

35:18.040 --> 35:19.200
There's egg on my face.

35:19.200 --> 35:20.720
Do you have eggs by the way?

35:20.720 --> 35:21.600
Okay.

35:21.600 --> 35:23.360
Hey, what's this green shit?

35:23.360 --> 35:25.960
Vegetarian isn't just a trend for Taco Bell.

35:25.960 --> 35:28.040
Yeah, except for that one time

35:28.040 --> 35:31.360
that you fucking blinked in the face of pandemic

35:31.360 --> 35:33.760
and got rid of potatoes.

35:33.760 --> 35:36.960
You are barely doing it already with potatoes.

35:36.960 --> 35:38.920
The brand has had meatless menu items

35:38.920 --> 35:40.760
like the bean burrito for many years.

35:40.760 --> 35:42.880
Fuck off, McDonald's has French fries.

35:42.880 --> 35:43.800
What are you doing?

35:44.800 --> 35:47.600
And it was the first quick service restaurant chain

35:47.600 --> 35:50.000
to partner with the American Vegetarian Association

35:50.000 --> 35:52.680
and currently has over 30 vegetarian ingredients

35:52.680 --> 35:54.880
on the US menu.

35:54.880 --> 35:56.600
That's a weird way of-

35:56.600 --> 35:58.840
There's a lot of vegetarian ingredients

35:58.840 --> 36:00.960
in non-vegetarian meals.

36:02.240 --> 36:04.320
What if Mr. King

36:05.720 --> 36:09.280
only wants to be the potato man from now on?

36:10.120 --> 36:14.600
What if he stops doing public facing?

36:14.600 --> 36:16.720
You're saying we get like-

36:16.720 --> 36:21.720
Well, quarterly profits are down much worse than we thought

36:21.720 --> 36:24.280
and we're gonna have to lay off a lot of,

36:24.280 --> 36:29.280
oh no, I'm always the potato man.

36:29.280 --> 36:30.120
That's interesting to me

36:30.120 --> 36:32.040
because I would have said and wondered

36:32.040 --> 36:34.520
if perhaps he has always been the potato

36:34.520 --> 36:36.520
and this is the first time it was appropriate

36:36.520 --> 36:37.480
for him to show his face.

36:37.480 --> 36:40.200
Because Justin, you've never brought to us

36:40.200 --> 36:43.720
a video clip from Mr. King before, is that correct?

36:43.720 --> 36:45.800
Well, he did take over CE,

36:45.800 --> 36:48.360
I'm looking at his LinkedIn page, which is wild.

36:48.360 --> 36:52.520
And he was at Adidas until August 2019.

36:52.520 --> 36:54.200
So he joined, wow, he joined Taco Bell

36:54.200 --> 36:55.640
and he got to taste the potatoes

36:55.640 --> 36:58.120
and then COVID took them fucking away.

36:58.120 --> 36:59.440
He joined, they were like,

36:59.440 --> 37:03.000
listen, Mark, this is gonna be the cushiest gig ever.

37:03.000 --> 37:05.840
We just opened up the potato vault

37:05.840 --> 37:08.200
and people are losing their fucking minds over here.

37:08.200 --> 37:10.360
And as soon as he pulls into the parking lot,

37:10.360 --> 37:12.120
they're like, bad news, Mark,

37:12.120 --> 37:14.240
we had a shit can of potatoes.

37:14.240 --> 37:16.560
Also, you gotta wear masks now, if you can believe that.

37:16.560 --> 37:18.680
He's been sitting on this character.

37:18.680 --> 37:20.520
Oh yeah, this potato character.

37:20.520 --> 37:23.240
I think a potato in Spanish could be Papa.

37:23.240 --> 37:25.240
So we could just call him Papa King.

37:25.240 --> 37:26.920
Papa King is here.

37:26.920 --> 37:28.320
Papa King is here to save the day.

37:28.320 --> 37:30.040
He's the new beloved, Mr. Peanut, fuck off.

37:30.040 --> 37:31.720
Eat me, children.

37:31.720 --> 37:34.040
Eat of me, children, I'm the Papa King.

37:34.040 --> 37:36.280
So you can, that's happening in March,

37:36.280 --> 37:38.440
I guess put it on your calendars right now.

37:38.440 --> 37:40.040
Yeah, get there.

37:40.040 --> 37:41.680
I do appreciate how everybody,

37:41.680 --> 37:43.800
I mean, literally this potato vid was out there

37:43.800 --> 37:47.080
for 30 seconds before people were like, alert, alert, alert.

37:47.080 --> 37:49.800
If you go to this tweet, the first like 10 responses

37:49.800 --> 37:51.360
are like, Justin, look quick.

37:52.440 --> 37:54.040
Okay, can I do a Yahoo, please?

37:54.040 --> 37:55.880
Yes, please. Yeah, please.

37:55.880 --> 37:57.760
Here's one that was sent in by also several people.

37:57.760 --> 38:00.840
Thank you, it's from Yahoo Answers user Bush, who asks,

38:01.960 --> 38:05.280
is there a way to revive stale Cheez-Its?

38:05.280 --> 38:08.640
I need to fix them to bring to a dinner party tonight.

38:08.640 --> 38:11.040
Update, no bad taste or nothing,

38:11.040 --> 38:13.960
just soft like white bread from the staleness.

38:13.960 --> 38:15.280
Pfft.

38:15.280 --> 38:17.560
Soft like white bread from the staleness

38:17.560 --> 38:21.600
feels like a Macklemore lyric to me.

38:21.600 --> 38:23.720
Yeah, yeah.

38:23.720 --> 38:26.960
I need to fix the, fix,

38:26.960 --> 38:31.280
fix in the sense of not to like fix you up some food,

38:31.280 --> 38:36.000
but to repair these old Cheez-Its really does it for me.

38:36.000 --> 38:37.600
Really, really does it for me.

38:37.600 --> 38:39.040
Gotta fix them Cheez-Its.

38:39.040 --> 38:42.520
Can I fix or revive these here stale Cheez-Its?

38:42.520 --> 38:45.120
Well, you can start with a pep talk.

38:45.120 --> 38:47.240
Interesting, try to inspire the Cheez-Its.

38:47.240 --> 38:51.680
Listen, might not do nothing, but it also won't hurt.

38:51.680 --> 38:52.520
You know what I mean?

38:52.520 --> 38:53.360
Start there.

38:53.360 --> 38:54.720
I would say what you don't wanna do

38:54.720 --> 38:56.520
is start with something that might potentially

38:56.520 --> 38:58.480
ruin the Cheez-Its more.

38:58.480 --> 38:59.320
Yeah.

38:59.320 --> 39:00.600
I think you wanna work up to that, right?

39:00.600 --> 39:02.640
Yeah, like there's probably a lot of jokesters

39:02.640 --> 39:04.680
in the audience who like to talk back to our show

39:04.680 --> 39:06.760
like they're a fourth member of the show

39:06.760 --> 39:09.600
who are like, dip it in water, duh,

39:09.600 --> 39:11.240
but that's gonna make it,

39:11.240 --> 39:12.920
that's gonna get it really sloppy,

39:12.920 --> 39:14.320
like a sloppy mushy mess.

39:14.320 --> 39:16.160
I think my first step would be pep talk.

39:16.160 --> 39:18.360
And then my second step would be like

39:18.360 --> 39:22.560
200 degrees Fahrenheit in an oven for 10 minutes.

39:22.560 --> 39:26.360
Oh, so you would just take them into full blown,

39:26.360 --> 39:28.400
like you're making Cheez-It brittle at that point.

39:28.400 --> 39:32.320
Well, I would lay them out in a single layer

39:32.320 --> 39:33.560
as close together as I can.

39:33.560 --> 39:35.840
I'm trying to get, I mean, they're squares.

39:35.840 --> 39:38.440
This is how you make, this is like Cheez-It biscotti.

39:38.440 --> 39:40.040
Yes, exactly.

39:40.040 --> 39:41.200
Okay.

39:41.200 --> 39:43.200
That probably wouldn't work either.

39:43.200 --> 39:45.360
You could make a hell of a Cheez-It casserole

39:45.360 --> 39:46.560
I'm thinking now.

39:46.560 --> 39:47.880
I mean, you could do, I mean, yeah,

39:47.880 --> 39:50.280
crumbling up the Cheez-Its and using it as a coating

39:50.280 --> 39:51.840
for some, I don't know, tilapia.

39:51.840 --> 39:53.000
Oh, okay.

39:53.000 --> 39:54.880
I was thinking more of like using them

39:54.880 --> 39:57.160
like one might use lasagna noodles.

39:58.080 --> 39:59.760
Oh, no, you, okay.

39:59.760 --> 40:03.080
Well, that's malarkey, Trav.

40:03.080 --> 40:04.880
You can't just do that. You don't think like layering?

40:04.880 --> 40:07.640
So it would be like sauce, cheese, Cheez-Its,

40:07.640 --> 40:08.480
sauce, cheese, Cheez-Its.

40:08.480 --> 40:10.920
No, it can be like a hat on a green bean casserole,

40:10.920 --> 40:15.920
but it can't be load bearing Cheez-Its, Jesus Christ.

40:15.960 --> 40:20.320
I've seen on some life hack videos

40:20.320 --> 40:24.000
that if you put a piece of bread in with your cookies,

40:24.000 --> 40:26.480
it'll keep them soft and I'm just not realizing

40:26.480 --> 40:27.320
we're trying to do the opposite of that.

40:27.320 --> 40:28.160
Yeah, we'd have to do the opposite.

40:28.160 --> 40:30.400
So what's the opposite of bread?

40:30.400 --> 40:31.920
Milk?

40:31.920 --> 40:32.760
Milk?

40:32.760 --> 40:33.600
Is milk the opposite of bread?

40:33.600 --> 40:34.880
Is milk the opposite of bread?

40:34.880 --> 40:36.720
People don't talk about the opposites of things

40:36.720 --> 40:37.920
that don't have opposites enough.

40:37.920 --> 40:39.400
Cause what is the opposite of bread?

40:39.400 --> 40:40.520
An orange?

40:40.520 --> 40:42.360
Okay, so it can't be milk

40:42.360 --> 40:45.400
because milk is like consumable.

40:45.400 --> 40:46.480
Bread is consumable.

40:46.480 --> 40:47.880
They're both white, usually.

40:47.880 --> 40:49.320
Bread is flat and square.

40:49.320 --> 40:52.080
Orange is round and 3D.

40:52.080 --> 40:53.960
Consumable by you.

40:53.960 --> 40:54.800
Baseball then.

40:54.800 --> 40:56.040
Sponge, sponge, sponge.

40:56.040 --> 40:57.360
Sponge, same shape.

40:57.360 --> 40:58.200
Baseball.

40:58.200 --> 40:59.520
Oh, you want the opposite, well then.

40:59.520 --> 41:01.440
The opposite of bread.

41:01.440 --> 41:04.520
The opposite of bread is creation.

41:04.520 --> 41:05.800
The opposite of bread isn't milk.

41:05.800 --> 41:07.360
It's creation.

41:07.360 --> 41:08.200
Woo!

41:11.640 --> 41:12.720
Bum, bim, bum, bum.

41:15.680 --> 41:18.760
Right, so bread is,

41:18.760 --> 41:21.040
I'm just gonna start listing things that bread is.

41:21.040 --> 41:23.880
Okay, okay, this is a three-part process.

41:23.880 --> 41:25.840
I'm gonna list the things that bread is.

41:25.840 --> 41:27.120
Okay.

41:27.120 --> 41:30.680
Travis, you're gonna tell me the opposite of that thing.

41:30.680 --> 41:33.040
Griffin, you're going to keep track

41:33.040 --> 41:36.760
of the different descriptors that we have until-

41:36.760 --> 41:37.600
Can you just yawn, Griffin?

41:37.600 --> 41:38.720
Can you just fucking yawn?

41:38.720 --> 41:39.560
Sorry, guys.

41:39.560 --> 41:40.400
Sorry, dudes.

41:40.400 --> 41:42.720
That was a pre-yawn for how boring this is gonna be.

41:42.720 --> 41:45.040
All right, well fucking, well, you know what then?

41:45.040 --> 41:47.080
I'm not doing it now.

41:47.080 --> 41:48.640
So sorry, listeners.

41:48.640 --> 41:49.880
We were trying to have some fun

41:49.880 --> 41:51.720
and do science at the same time.

41:51.720 --> 41:53.000
Let your kids learn something.

41:53.000 --> 41:55.400
Like what the opposite of bread is?

41:55.400 --> 41:56.240
Yeah.

41:56.240 --> 41:57.640
You tell me what's the opposite of bread

41:57.640 --> 42:01.440
because you have struck out so many times.

42:01.440 --> 42:02.920
The sun.

42:05.240 --> 42:06.080
Yeah.

42:06.080 --> 42:07.520
Hot.

42:07.520 --> 42:09.960
Oh, you want it to be, bread can be cold.

42:10.920 --> 42:11.880
What?

42:11.880 --> 42:13.240
Bread can be cold.

42:14.560 --> 42:16.400
I will say bread has to be colder.

42:16.400 --> 42:17.600
That's true.

42:17.600 --> 42:18.920
Yeah.

42:18.920 --> 42:20.720
Cold, different shade.

42:20.720 --> 42:22.800
This is a, guys, it's sliding doors.

42:22.800 --> 42:24.720
We're getting a glimpse into the alternate reality

42:24.720 --> 42:26.200
where Justin did get to do his

42:26.200 --> 42:28.160
what's the opposite of bread game.

42:28.160 --> 42:30.720
And it's got me fucking busting up

42:30.720 --> 42:32.040
and my sides are splitting.

42:32.040 --> 42:34.960
Okay, it's the sun.

42:34.960 --> 42:36.000
I think it's the sun.

42:36.000 --> 42:38.360
So just put the sun in with your cheeses.

42:38.360 --> 42:39.480
Bada bing, bada boom.

42:39.480 --> 42:40.920
Color-wise, I don't agree with you.

42:40.920 --> 42:42.800
What kind of dinner party

42:42.800 --> 42:45.640
can you bring secondhand cheeses to?

42:47.760 --> 42:49.120
I think, Griffin, at this point,

42:49.120 --> 42:53.200
if you're going to a dinner party in January of 2021,

42:53.200 --> 42:55.640
anything, like at this point,

42:55.640 --> 43:00.000
we don't remember what dinner party is.

43:00.000 --> 43:00.920
That would be a good,

43:00.920 --> 43:03.360
if you could unload them in like a snack mix

43:03.360 --> 43:06.480
that you bring to the first party you attend

43:06.480 --> 43:08.960
once everybody's vaccinated, that would be great.

43:08.960 --> 43:10.320
Cause it's like, who even cares?

43:10.320 --> 43:13.800
These are, okay, I do, these are actually very chewy.

43:13.800 --> 43:15.200
I am not loving it.

43:15.200 --> 43:16.920
Okay, now I'm thinking about it.

43:16.920 --> 43:19.440
I can't think of a thing that is more likely

43:19.440 --> 43:24.440
to get grubby hands all over it than Cheez-It.

43:24.440 --> 43:25.280
Yeah.

43:25.280 --> 43:27.440
If you put it out, though, in a party setting,

43:28.360 --> 43:31.360
you are like, okay, if I eat something at a party

43:31.360 --> 43:34.360
and it's like stale or cold or too chewy,

43:34.360 --> 43:37.000
I just assume like, oh, this has been out a little long.

43:37.000 --> 43:38.600
I should have hit this up earlier.

43:38.600 --> 43:39.760
So, you know what I mean?

43:39.760 --> 43:40.800
Like, I don't know, they're crispy

43:40.800 --> 43:41.840
when I put them in the bowl.

43:41.840 --> 43:43.360
What's wrong with your bowl?

43:43.360 --> 43:47.440
Oh, so you're saying you can sort of launder the Cheez-Its.

43:47.440 --> 43:48.880
Hey, did you give me a wet bowl?

43:48.880 --> 43:52.240
Exactly, exactly, you launder the Cheez-Its.

43:52.240 --> 43:54.680
You put one sandwich bag full of Cheez-Its

43:54.680 --> 43:55.800
in everybody's pockets

43:55.800 --> 43:57.440
after they leave their coats on the bed.

43:57.440 --> 43:59.760
This bowl has some kind of time weirdness.

43:59.760 --> 44:01.480
It made my Cheez-Its get old.

44:01.480 --> 44:02.920
I think we can all agree.

44:02.920 --> 44:05.720
Is this one of those weird time bowls?

44:05.720 --> 44:08.040
Best case scenario, someone else brings a box of Cheez-Its

44:08.040 --> 44:09.720
and after they've dumped theirs in a bowl,

44:09.720 --> 44:12.640
you dump yours in a bowl and you kind of mix them together.

44:12.640 --> 44:13.680
So at that point, we were like,

44:13.680 --> 44:15.160
I think something's wrong with these Cheez-Its,

44:15.160 --> 44:18.360
but I also think something's not wrong with these Cheez-Its.

44:18.360 --> 44:19.920
I think something is wrong

44:19.920 --> 44:22.360
with some of these quantum Cheez-Its

44:22.360 --> 44:24.320
because some are good and some are bad.

44:24.320 --> 44:26.760
Is it possible for half of a box of Cheez-Its

44:26.760 --> 44:29.560
to go stale while the other half stays primo?

44:31.080 --> 44:33.440
Is that any, is that anything?

44:33.440 --> 44:36.160
You try these and you tell me I'm being silly, Derek.

44:36.160 --> 44:38.040
I don't want to have this fight again.

44:38.040 --> 44:40.200
Would the moisture redistribute

44:40.200 --> 44:42.800
make all of the Cheez-Its kind of stale?

44:42.800 --> 44:45.000
Would it work that way?

44:45.000 --> 44:46.720
Maybe they, oh, they didn't turn their box.

44:46.720 --> 44:47.960
You gotta turn your box.

44:47.960 --> 44:50.760
You gotta rotate the box halfway through the half.

44:50.760 --> 44:51.920
Something's wrong with my Cheez-Its.

44:51.920 --> 44:54.440
How long did you leave them in the sun for?

44:54.440 --> 44:55.280
I didn't.

44:55.280 --> 44:58.880
Well, you gotta, I mean, you gotta sun dry your Cheez-Its.

44:58.880 --> 44:59.920
Hey guys.

44:59.920 --> 45:00.760
Yeah?

45:00.760 --> 45:02.520
I would fucking ruin some Cheez-Its right now.

45:02.520 --> 45:03.360
It's all I'm thinking about.

45:03.360 --> 45:04.200
Oh my God, I'm so hungry for Cheez-Its.

45:04.200 --> 45:05.960
I've been thinking about white cheddar Cheez-Its

45:05.960 --> 45:07.040
for the past like three minutes

45:07.040 --> 45:10.120
and I actually have noticed that I am shaking.

45:10.120 --> 45:13.480
I am, I am, like my body is noticeably shaking.

45:13.480 --> 45:14.960
Well, folks, that is our cue.

45:14.960 --> 45:15.800
You know what?

45:15.800 --> 45:17.160
I would call it quivering.

45:17.160 --> 45:20.360
That is how badly I want these white cheddar Cheez-Its.

45:20.360 --> 45:22.360
That is our cue to stop doing podcasts

45:22.360 --> 45:25.360
and to release you back into the wild.

45:25.360 --> 45:26.480
We have tagged you.

45:26.480 --> 45:27.520
Now we're opening the door

45:27.520 --> 45:31.520
and you may once again roam free with the rest of your kind.

45:31.520 --> 45:32.960
Thank you so much for joining us.

45:32.960 --> 45:34.360
We very much appreciate you.

45:34.360 --> 45:38.680
Hey, if I could ask you, we're writing a podcast book.

45:38.680 --> 45:41.000
It's called, Everybody Has a Podcast Except You.

45:41.000 --> 45:43.480
You can find it at bit.ly forward slash,

45:43.480 --> 45:44.880
what, McElroy podcast book?

45:44.880 --> 45:46.200
Yeah, that's right.

45:46.200 --> 45:49.160
If you go pre-order that, it would really help us out

45:49.160 --> 45:51.840
and you could get it.

45:51.840 --> 45:53.120
There's lots of different places you can get it.

45:53.120 --> 45:55.040
I recommend, if I may, Justin,

45:55.040 --> 45:58.080
bit.ly slash McElroy podcast book event.

45:58.080 --> 46:01.480
You can find links to six independent bookstores

46:01.480 --> 46:04.760
and event info for our free virtual event

46:04.760 --> 46:08.920
that is happening next week on January 26th at 9 p.m.

46:08.920 --> 46:10.080
It is completely free.

46:10.080 --> 46:11.680
The event is.

46:11.680 --> 46:12.800
And if you pre-order

46:12.800 --> 46:14.480
from one of those independent bookstores,

46:14.480 --> 46:16.840
you get a signed copy from one of us.

46:16.840 --> 46:18.560
You get a book plate that's signed by one of us

46:18.560 --> 46:20.840
that you can put in your book.

46:20.840 --> 46:21.680
It's pretty cool.

46:21.680 --> 46:22.520
Cool.

46:22.520 --> 46:23.680
We got a new pin of the month.

46:23.680 --> 46:25.200
It's a Cerberus pin of the month,

46:25.200 --> 46:27.960
and it's a doggy with all of our faces on it.

46:27.960 --> 46:31.120
A reference to maybe our deepest cut reference

46:31.120 --> 46:33.680
of a live episode of The Adventure Zone Amnesty,

46:33.680 --> 46:37.280
which is a very good episode if you haven't heard it.

46:37.280 --> 46:41.440
But also all the proceeds are going to benefit Gnar All,

46:41.440 --> 46:43.080
which fights for access

46:43.080 --> 46:45.280
to abortion care, birth control, paid parental leaves,

46:45.280 --> 46:48.880
and protections from pregnancy discrimination.

46:48.880 --> 46:50.640
That pin designed by Zachary Sterling.

46:50.640 --> 46:51.480
Yes, thank you, Zach.

46:51.480 --> 46:53.360
We also have our Knights Templar II sticker

46:53.360 --> 46:54.600
designed by Tyler Reed up there

46:54.600 --> 46:56.920
and a bunch of other stuff, mackraymerch.com.

46:56.920 --> 46:59.520
And also pre-order the next Taz book, Crystal Kingdom.

46:59.520 --> 47:01.320
Go to theadventurezonecomic.com.

47:01.320 --> 47:03.600
Comes out July 13th, 2021, but don't wait.

47:03.600 --> 47:04.440
Get on it now.

47:04.440 --> 47:06.720
Also, and this is just a personal one for me,

47:06.720 --> 47:08.200
go check out The Besties.

47:08.200 --> 47:10.280
It's available on like every podcast channel.

47:10.280 --> 47:11.800
Oh, we don't make money on it anymore.

47:11.800 --> 47:12.640
So we don't actually-

47:12.640 --> 47:13.480
Yeah, so I don't care if you don't buy it.

47:13.480 --> 47:14.400
No, but I want you to-

47:14.400 --> 47:16.320
But it isn't exclusive to Spotify anymore.

47:16.320 --> 47:17.400
I want everyone to check it out

47:17.400 --> 47:18.240
because I love it very much.

47:18.240 --> 47:19.760
Actually, also this latest episode,

47:19.760 --> 47:21.720
we talk about Cyberpunk with Ron Funches

47:21.720 --> 47:23.280
and it's a fucking banger.

47:23.280 --> 47:24.600
Oh man, really?

47:24.600 --> 47:26.560
Yeah, it's a good episode.

47:26.560 --> 47:28.720
Oh boy, I'm excited about that.

47:28.720 --> 47:30.720
Thanks to Maximum Fun for having us on the network.

47:30.720 --> 47:33.200

47:33.200 --> 47:35.080
Tune in, drop out, you know, baby.

47:35.080 --> 47:36.760
Do you want to find Yahoo?

47:36.760 --> 47:37.600
At least it's finding Yahoo.

47:37.600 --> 47:38.880
It was sent in by Graham Roebuck.

47:38.880 --> 47:39.720
Thank you, Graham.

47:39.720 --> 47:41.640
It's Yahoo Answers user.

47:41.640 --> 47:43.040
They're anonymous.

47:43.040 --> 47:46.040
So I'm going to call them also,

47:46.040 --> 47:47.380
Papa King asks,

47:48.400 --> 47:52.240
would Cam the Dancer, if he spend too fast,

47:52.240 --> 47:54.080
create the tornado?

47:55.080 --> 47:59.760
My name is Justin McElroy.

47:59.760 --> 48:01.080
I'm Travis McElroy.

48:01.080 --> 48:03.080
I'm Griffin McElroy.

48:03.080 --> 48:04.200
It's been my brother, my brother and me.

48:04.200 --> 48:06.600
Kiss your dad square on the lips.

48:06.600 --> 48:08.640
Okay, that was the show.

48:08.640 --> 48:10.600
Hope you had some fun.

48:10.600 --> 48:14.600
Talked for an hour and now our job is done.

48:14.600 --> 48:18.640
Go back into the world, face the day ahead.

48:18.640 --> 48:20.920
Please don't tell our grandparents

48:20.920 --> 48:22.760
all the cuss words we said.

48:29.120 --> 48:30.880
