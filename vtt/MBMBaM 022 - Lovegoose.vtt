00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:06.000 --> 00:12.000
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:12.000 --> 00:19.000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
What's up, you cool baby?

00:21.000 --> 00:30.000
If you change your mind, I'm the first in line. Honey, I'm still free, take a chance on me.

00:30.000 --> 00:40.000
If you need me, let me know, I'm gonna be around. If you got no place to go, when you're feeling down.

00:40.000 --> 00:45.000
If you're all alone, when the pretty birds have flown.

00:45.000 --> 00:56.000
What day is it, son? Game day. Time to play until the whistle blows. This is the sage advice passed on by one Matthew McConaughey in the film We Are Martians.

00:56.000 --> 01:03.000
It's advice we try to live by every single day. It's my brother, my brother, and me. It's an advice show for the modern era.

01:03.000 --> 01:15.000
What we do here is channel the wisdom of Matthew McConaughey and try to filter it to a form that is usable to you, the common man or woman.

01:15.000 --> 01:22.000
What would you guys think of if when I edit the show this week, we just get like a constant like bongo beat going on underneath it?

01:22.000 --> 01:26.000
Yeah, like a really groovy, like a really chill.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
Something you can really sack to.

01:28.000 --> 01:34.000
Yeah, you can like, you can hear the spirit sort of welling up from the bongo tones.

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
I am so disgusted right now.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
I can't even put it into words.

01:39.000 --> 01:49.000
Well, instead of the bongos, I would be happy listening to 40 minutes of bongos, but let's instead not waste our talent.

01:49.000 --> 01:54.000
Let's not keep our proverbial light under a bushel. Let's pass down some wisdom.

01:54.000 --> 01:58.000
Our first question comes from FormSpring.

01:58.000 --> 02:02.000
I proposed to my girlfriend a couple of weeks ago and she said yes.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
Congratulations.

02:04.000 --> 02:08.000
But I found out she's been texting one of her coworkers a lot lately.

02:08.000 --> 02:14.000
One of the texts said that he was watching a movie and he started thinking of her.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
What do I do?

02:16.000 --> 02:20.000
FormSpring, FormSpring, FormSpring.

02:20.000 --> 02:27.000
Okay, I don't like the sound of it, but I also don't like the sound of you reading her text messages.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
Can I, can I propose something?

02:29.000 --> 02:33.000
Griffin, I'm sorry to step on some toes here, but my advice is to pack your bags.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
No, no, no, no, no, no.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
No, no, I'm with him on this one.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
I think you got to get out.

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
You don't trust her and she's in love with Jerry in Accounts Receivable.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
You got to get out.

02:44.000 --> 02:48.000
Listen, man, you both fucked up.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
You both fucked up.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
You fucked up.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
You don't trust her.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
She doesn't love you.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
You fucked up.

02:54.000 --> 02:58.000
She, you have a reason to not trust her because she's fucking Jerry in Accounts Receivable.

02:58.000 --> 03:03.000
But this is the true test of love that everyone goes through after they propose to their significant other.

03:03.000 --> 03:13.000
Is that both of them get the jitters and one of them fucks someone they work with and one of them reads her text message, which isn't as bad a crime, I think.

03:13.000 --> 03:17.000
Okay, now, joking aside, because this is serious.

03:17.000 --> 03:26.000
You are, you are at a point in a marriage where it's possible that she is not regretting the decision to agree to marry you.

03:26.000 --> 03:32.000
But maybe she's feeling a little spooked by it and she's getting a little flirty with Jerry.

03:32.000 --> 03:44.000
And, you know, you are making a long term commitment to her and you're, you know, you're being kind of a jealous dude about it, like all completely natural emotions.

03:44.000 --> 03:51.000
But here's the thing, like, if you are at this point in your relationship, like you're not even married yet, you have got to be able to talk to her.

03:51.000 --> 04:02.000
Like, you've got to be able to say, hey, just walk up to her, grab her shoulders and say, hey, I forgive you for fucking Jerry in Accounts Receivable and see what the reaction was.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
Just start the conversation.

04:04.000 --> 04:09.000
And fourth ring, I'm not trying to judge you, but this is like general advice for everyone.

04:09.000 --> 04:17.000
If you propose to your girlfriend before you trust her enough to not cheat on you, you shouldn't have proposed to her yet.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
Listen, that's in the past.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
Look at Travis in the rear view.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
I'm looking at the future.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
I'm just saying, like, this is general advice for everyone from the future on.

04:26.000 --> 04:30.000
That should be on your checklist before you pop that question.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
I agree. I agree.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
But what you're feeling is natural.

04:32.000 --> 04:42.000
The thing is, if you get in that jealous mindset where, like, you think something's going on, that is something that your partner is not going to be able to talk you down from.

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
Like, they're not going to be able to say anything that will satisfy that.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
You've got to let that go.

04:47.000 --> 04:54.000
Like, if you want to talk to her about it, talk to her about it, but then seriously let it go because that kind of shit will haunt you forever.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
Also, you're a guy, right?

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
I think so.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
Think back for a second there, FormSpring.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
You ever said some creepy stuff to a girl that's in a relationship?

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
I bet you have.

05:04.000 --> 05:12.000
If you're a dude, I bet you said some creepy stuff to a girl who's engaged, married, or in a serious relationship, right?

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
Let him without sin.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
Yeah, really.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
Cast that first tone, FormSpring.

05:16.000 --> 05:22.000
And honestly, the last thing you want to do is to go out to her and say, hey, I was reading your texts and blank.

05:22.000 --> 05:28.000
I have another suggestion that's good for the economy, if you think about it.

05:28.000 --> 05:32.000
There's one industry that's been really suffering in these rough times.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
Oil.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
No.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
Okay.

05:35.000 --> 05:41.000
It is the profession, the noble profession of the private investigator.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
Whoa, yeah, get Keith Mars up on that bitch.

05:43.000 --> 05:47.000
Get Keith or Veronica, if they're available.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
Or Encyclopedia Brown.

05:49.000 --> 05:53.000
Encyclopedia Brown, Nancy Drew, any of these fictional characters.

05:53.000 --> 05:57.000
See if they're available to just follow her around.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
Guys, listen.

05:59.000 --> 06:04.000
I can't even say this, but I'll use pig Latin, so I know what I'm talking about.

06:04.000 --> 06:10.000
What about a o-fessional-prey-assassin way?

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
Listen, listen.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
Wassassin?

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
Well, like with a vowel.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
What is a wasassin?

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
You got to add a W.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
It's French.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
You got a W at the end of his vowel.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
Hey, get a hitman.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
Hitman.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
Hitman.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
Hey, that's what we're talking about.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
To L.K. Airy J.

06:28.000 --> 06:35.000
And then she'll run to you, she'll be so distraught, so despondent at the loss of her precious Jerry,

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
that she'll never leave you again.

06:38.000 --> 06:44.000
And at the funeral, at just one point, say really cryptically, well, that's what happens.

06:44.000 --> 06:48.000
And then there's that.

06:48.000 --> 06:52.000
If you follow through with this plan, you delete this episode of My Bim Bam from your computer.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
Oh my god.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
So when the police read it, they'll be like, this is so weird.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
There's no episode 22 in here.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
We were really enjoying it.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
It just skips 22.

07:00.000 --> 07:06.000
Oh, and make sure, make sure as you're driving away, you hand her a handy wipe.

07:06.000 --> 07:10.000
And she'll look at you quizzically, and you say, oh, that's for the blood on your hands.

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
I hope the texts are worth it, creepo.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
This is from Clearly Not a Stalker, Gmail.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
Huh, well.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
Huh.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
Well, good start.

07:19.000 --> 07:22.000
I was recently in class, and I overheard a girl's name.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
Okay?

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
Sounds pretty normal so far.

07:24.000 --> 07:28.000
She looked cute, so I ascertained her last name by checking the roll online.

07:28.000 --> 07:38.000
Then I proceeded to Google her and got information about her family and her brother and her birthday

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
and everything.

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
My question is this.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
Is asking about her family a good opener?

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
Should I just straight up ask, how's James?

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
I saw on Google he was sick.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
Thanks.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
I can't finish the question.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
Don't do that.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
Don't do that at all.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
In fact, travel back in time and don't do all that shit you just told us you did.

07:58.000 --> 08:02.000
What's more important is go back in time and not send us that question.

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
Listen, you can't, you can't ever be with her now.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
You have got to bail on this.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
You're done with this.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
You mess this one up.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
You get married.

08:11.000 --> 08:15.000
You got toddlers running around on the floor, and you look at her and you say, hey, hey, babe.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
I know we've had a long, happy decade together.

08:17.000 --> 08:21.000
I just want to tell you that I started our relationship by creepy.

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
You remember Google that used to be on the Internet?

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
You remember the Internet?

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
It used to be before you all had implants.

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
I googled you before the cybernet, before Skynet.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
I googled you and your whole family.

08:32.000 --> 08:35.000
Okay, here's my advice.

08:35.000 --> 08:42.000
Go to a novelty store and buy a Jordan visor and then run up to her and tell her that you're her grandson from the future.

08:42.000 --> 08:50.000
Come back and use all that information to convince her that you are her grandson from the future.

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
I am a big fan.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
Wow, you guys have a complete 180.

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
I am a huge fan of everything that has happened so far.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
Clearly not a stalker.

09:00.000 --> 09:04.000
The Geordie contingent, let's call it.

09:04.000 --> 09:13.000
If you employ the Geordie contingent, I think that there's a really great chance that you could have the love of your life in your hands.

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
Oh, and then convince her that you're your own grandfather.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
Yeah, that's good.

09:18.000 --> 09:30.000
Why don't we just cut out the middleman and actually hire LeVar Burton to put on the Geordie visor, come to your school and say that he is your great grandson from the future.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
I'm sure he is not busy.

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
Yeah, I'm pretty sure you could probably lock him down.

09:35.000 --> 09:39.000
And if you're a white person clearly not a stalker, it'll show like you're super open minded.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
You're down for anything.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
You don't care.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
You don't see race.

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
And that's something people are looking for in a stalker.

09:45.000 --> 09:49.000
I mean potential partner, not a stalker at all.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
From the future.

09:51.000 --> 09:55.000
Jay, oh Griffin, do you have a Yahoo for us?

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
Yeah, let me bust out a Yahoo.

09:57.000 --> 10:03.000
This one was sent in by, see this one's more of an in the show question.

10:03.000 --> 10:08.000
How about, this one's from Wax Catharsis who sent this in via Twitter.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
Fan of the show Wax Catharsis.

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
Thank you Wax Catharsis.

10:12.000 --> 10:17.000
But it's by Yahoo Answers user I Am Life who asks,

10:17.000 --> 10:21.000
How can a person live young forever in this body?

10:21.000 --> 10:25.000
Is it possible for a person to live forever young in this body?

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
We have been programmed to died.

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
We purchased gravesite plot and life insurance.

10:30.000 --> 10:36.000
So is it possible for a person to deprogram themselves to live instead of dying?

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
Whoa.

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
I'm glad someone finally cleared away the mist.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
You know what I mean?

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
Yeah, right.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
Cut right through the BS.

10:44.000 --> 10:48.000
Every time I go to a funeral, I just look at them and think, oh, you.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
You dummy.

10:49.000 --> 10:53.000
You cog in the machine doing exactly what the man tells you to do.

10:53.000 --> 10:57.000
Everyone knows that death is just a creation of big funeral home.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
Yeah.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
And big funeral home.

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
Big funeral.

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
There's a really depressing answer on this which says,

11:05.000 --> 11:09.000
the inevitability of death is what gives us a reason to live.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
Immortality would never work.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
You know who you're going to live.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
You know you're going to live forever.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
So who cares?

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
The population would fall into a depression.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
You know what?

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
Everyone says that.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
I completely disagree.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
If I live forever, it would be awesome.

11:23.000 --> 11:28.000
It would be a nonstop 24 seven party into infinity.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
I think I could probably figure out something to do.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
Uh huh.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
I mean, I know, right?

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
Like, I would just start walking.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
Yeah.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
And like, where are you going?

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
Like, I don't know.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
I have forever.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
I'm not afraid of dying though.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
Yeah.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
Because it's not going to happen.

11:42.000 --> 11:46.000
It would make bad plastic surgery really regrettable though.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
Oh yeah.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
That's true.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
Also tattoos.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
Yeah.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
Tattoos.

11:51.000 --> 11:56.000
You would need it around your 48,000th birthday.

11:56.000 --> 12:00.000
I think it would also allow us to complete a bunch of projects that you like didn't get

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
around to.

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
Like, you know, living in space.

12:04.000 --> 12:10.000
I just want to program myself to live until the first time that I use a jetpack.

12:10.000 --> 12:14.000
Like, if I have a jetpack, I'll probably try to fly that bitch into the sun.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
Because it's not going to get better than that.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
No.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
That's really where humanity is going to peak.

12:19.000 --> 12:25.000
What's troubling about this question is the terminology that we have been programmed to

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
dyed.

12:26.000 --> 12:30.000
Is there like a, is that an outpatient procedure I don't know about where like a doctor can

12:30.000 --> 12:35.000
just cut you open and like hook this vein up to this artery and then mix these nerves

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
and then what's up?

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
I'm the Highlander now.

12:39.000 --> 12:48.000
Except what if, what if the person who wrote this is not quite human?

12:48.000 --> 12:54.000
If you catch my drift, bicentennial man anyone?

12:54.000 --> 13:01.000
He only wants to be a human so that he can bone down on that one chick from that one

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
show or movie.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
His love is real, but he is not.

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
Oh, I was going to say his love is real, but his understanding of grammar is not.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
Damn it.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
Damn it.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
Stupid AI jokes.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
Hi, guys.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
Hello, James.

13:15.000 --> 13:20.000
Recently, school has started back up and my English teacher from last year contacted me

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
saying, I had the most improvement between the last two quarters.

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
God, I thought this email was going to take a sexy turn for a second.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
I got all excited.

13:27.000 --> 13:34.000
As such, she wishes for me to choose a book by Friday for her to buy and add to her class

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
library.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
Okay, maybe it is.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
He's turning around again.

13:37.000 --> 13:42.000
Last year, she had really boring cookie cutter books all year, so I want to recommend something

13:42.000 --> 13:46.000
interesting and appealing that a student would otherwise not find or read.

13:46.000 --> 13:51.000
I also wanted it to be something keyed into the nerd mindset without being deluded or

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
corny.

13:52.000 --> 13:56.000
I've come up stumped and wished for some McLarevoyant help.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
All right.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
I'll allow it.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
What do you guys recommend?

13:59.000 --> 14:05.000
With befuddlement, James from MA.

14:05.000 --> 14:08.000
What about the secret?

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
You want to set those kids on the right path.

14:10.000 --> 14:15.000
You want to get them thinking in a mindset that's going to equate with success and get

14:15.000 --> 14:18.000
rid of some of the demons that have been tormenting them.

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
What about Dianetics?

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
James, Dianetics.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
That's my official recommendation.

14:24.000 --> 14:31.000
I think that there's a vein we can tap into of books that will somehow create a sexual

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
rendezvous with your teacher.

14:33.000 --> 14:40.000
Books that will somehow suggest like, hey, if you're down, I'm down, but none are escaping

14:40.000 --> 14:41.000
me.

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
Is there a book out there?

14:42.000 --> 14:45.000
Is there a book out there that said, hey, teach, if you're down, I'm down?

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
Lolita for dudes.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
Lolita for dudes.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
Lolita.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
Lolita.

14:52.000 --> 14:57.000
What about a novelization of the film The Graduate?

14:57.000 --> 15:04.000
See, that's not a teacher as much as it is just a foxy older lady.

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
My suggestion is this what Tuesdays with Mori was about?

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
I didn't read it.

15:08.000 --> 15:12.000
No, but it is what Mitch Albom's One More Day was about.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
Okay.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.000
Yeah, I get his books confused.

15:14.000 --> 15:17.000
The ones are about getting wisdom from the elderly and the ones are about boning down

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
with your teacher.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
That's Tuesdays with Wanda.

15:19.000 --> 15:25.000
Yeah, there's some that are about just having conversations with his dead journalism professors

15:25.000 --> 15:29.000
and then there are some where he fucks older teachers.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
And there are crossover books that-

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
The crossover books are in poor taste, Mitch Albom.

15:33.000 --> 15:36.000
You need to get it together, sir.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
Stupid Mitch.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
What an asshole.

15:39.000 --> 15:42.000
I recommend The Alphabet of Manliness by Maddox.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.000
Yeah.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
No way.

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
My terrible secret is that I haven't read a book in about five years.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
Whoa.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
Sleep tight.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
Sleep tight, people who are taking advice from us.

15:51.000 --> 15:55.000
How about The Stand since I've been working on that one for about two and a half years

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
now?

15:56.000 --> 15:57.000
See, I was going to say Dune.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
Dune?

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
Travis?

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
Yeah.

16:00.000 --> 16:05.000
Guys, Griffin came and visited me like two weeks ago and he said, I haven't read The

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
Stand.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
I got like 50 pages left.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
Yeah.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
I haven't picked it up for about three weeks.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
What are you doing?

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
I got about 40 pages left now.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
I knocked out 10 the other day.

16:14.000 --> 16:17.000
I just went out on the porch for about six minutes.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
Yeah.

16:18.000 --> 16:22.000
You need to maybe start – you need to get more regular if that's all the reading you're

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
doing.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
Maybe.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
Maybe that's the problem.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
Hey.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.000
Hey.

16:27.000 --> 16:28.000
My bim bam.

16:28.000 --> 16:34.000
My friends are 21-ish and still think going to the mall like a bunch of girls is still

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
fun.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
That's sexist.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
Are they girls?

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
Okay.

16:38.000 --> 16:43.000
How do I get them to stop being so lame, turn that mall time into bar time?

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
Thanks, Steve.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
Oh, that's easy.

16:45.000 --> 16:48.000
By turning – you got to turn your friends into other friends.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
Can I try that ending again?

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
Thanks, Steve.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
Sorry.

16:52.000 --> 16:55.000
Turn your friends into other friends.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
I like that.

16:56.000 --> 17:03.000
You could go to the – we have a place in the Huntington Mall Club, Block and Barrel

17:03.000 --> 17:06.000
or something where it's like a bar within the mall.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.000
I like that.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
Yeah.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
Go to a mall bar.

17:09.000 --> 17:12.000
I think there are two answers to this question.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
There's one answer and one observation.

17:14.000 --> 17:26.640
The answer is to get them in the mindset that a bar is basically a mall for booze, for spirits.

17:26.640 --> 17:27.640
It's like a beer mall.

17:27.640 --> 17:28.640
It's like a beer mall basically.

17:28.640 --> 17:31.000
Well, not all are beer malls.

17:31.000 --> 17:36.440
Some of them are like shitty beer strip malls where they only have Miller Lite and –

17:36.440 --> 17:43.000
And some of them are strip beer malls, which is a whole other thing.

17:43.000 --> 17:51.200
But the other way of looking at it is you have a problem, which is maybe they do go

17:51.200 --> 17:59.400
to the bar with you a normal amount, but you don't want to go to the mall with them because

17:59.400 --> 18:02.360
they don't serve liquor there.

18:02.360 --> 18:07.960
I picture this awesome 1980s movie kind of situation where you're like, hey guys, let's

18:07.960 --> 18:11.520
go to a bar and all your friends kind of look at each other and smile and go, man, it's

18:11.520 --> 18:12.880
not bar time.

18:12.880 --> 18:20.220
And then in unison say, it's mall time and then cuts to a montage of them doing jumping

18:20.220 --> 18:22.040
jacks in the mall and stuff.

18:22.040 --> 18:24.520
But the whole time you're freaking out.

18:24.520 --> 18:28.980
You're just having a panic attack because you want to be in the corner.

18:28.980 --> 18:30.560
You go drive your car into a house.

18:30.560 --> 18:32.720
Jeremy, what are we doing this afternoon?

18:32.720 --> 18:40.000
Oh, I got to go pick up a gift for my meemaw at the Crate and Barrel.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
Ah, fuck that.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
Let's get drunk.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
Fuck that noise.

18:43.000 --> 18:44.000
I need some cargo.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
It's noon on Tuesday.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.360
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

18:48.360 --> 18:51.120
The mall closes at nine.

18:51.120 --> 18:52.120
What are you doing?

18:52.120 --> 18:55.280
Like, how could you not work these two things out together?

18:55.280 --> 18:57.680
Like, how could you not work this out?

18:57.680 --> 19:01.000
Like, well, the mall is closed now, time to go to a bar.

19:01.000 --> 19:05.760
If you're in the back of the Hot Topic hiding behind the corset, sneaking a drink from your

19:05.760 --> 19:09.920
flask, your friends are doing you a disservice from not tackling you and ripping the aboos

19:09.920 --> 19:10.920
out of your hand.

19:10.920 --> 19:12.960
Hey, guys, is it bar time?

19:12.960 --> 19:14.880
No, Steve, it's funeral time.

19:14.880 --> 19:17.680
I want to put beer in my face.

19:17.680 --> 19:18.680
I'm 21.

19:18.680 --> 19:22.400
I already have a problem.

19:22.400 --> 19:24.640
Oh, God.

19:24.640 --> 19:27.720
I'm headed to university on the 26th.

19:27.720 --> 19:28.720
Speak English, motherfucker.

19:28.720 --> 19:29.720
Whoa.

19:29.720 --> 19:31.880
And the word, Amy, is college.

19:31.880 --> 19:36.780
I'm headed to university on the 26th, and I wondered if you guys had any tips for introducing

19:36.780 --> 19:41.000
myself to those who will be living on the same floor of my student accommodation block.

19:41.000 --> 19:44.920
I'm usually rather shy when it comes to meeting new people.

19:44.920 --> 19:49.400
Before I would get my friends to do all the hard work and let the new person be introduced

19:49.400 --> 19:54.180
to me in conversation, however, my friends are spreading out, heading to different universities,

19:54.180 --> 19:55.920
and I'll be on my lonesome.

19:55.920 --> 19:59.600
What's the best way to build up the confidence to say hi to someone new?

19:59.600 --> 20:03.680
Or would you recommend me doing the opposite, play some music on my laptop, then hope and

20:03.680 --> 20:07.600
pray someone will dig my taste in tunes, which is very broad, to act as a conversation starter?

20:07.600 --> 20:08.600
No.

20:08.600 --> 20:09.600
Don't do that, Richard.

20:09.600 --> 20:10.600
Don't do that.

20:10.600 --> 20:14.720
Hey, who's that guy that's always playing music from his laptop with his door open and

20:14.720 --> 20:15.720
looking expectantly outside?

20:15.720 --> 20:20.520
With a bowl of chips and a couple of open beers.

20:20.520 --> 20:21.520
That's weird, Richard.

20:21.520 --> 20:23.520
No one goes in his room.

20:23.520 --> 20:24.520
Don't go in there.

20:24.520 --> 20:28.880
He's always talking about deep Dave Matthews band cuts to nobody.

20:28.880 --> 20:30.320
He's just yelling it into the hallway.

20:30.320 --> 20:33.560
If anybody wants to talk about music, I'll be in here.

20:33.560 --> 20:35.760
He calls his room the boneyard.

20:35.760 --> 20:39.160
There's a B-side to under the table and dreaming.

20:39.160 --> 20:40.160
Deep cut.

20:40.160 --> 20:43.480
I went out to the boneyard and got this deep cut.

20:43.480 --> 20:49.520
Richard, real answer is everyone else is feeling the exact same way that you are.

20:49.520 --> 20:53.120
You can set yourself up as the cool guy just by walking up to people and introducing yourself,

20:53.120 --> 20:57.120
because they want to be introduced to you just as bad as you want to be introduced to

20:57.120 --> 20:58.120
them.

20:58.120 --> 20:59.120
You've got to get in the mindset.

20:59.120 --> 21:02.520
You've got to pretend when you get there day one that you've already made five friends.

21:02.520 --> 21:06.680
Act like a guy who's already made five friends there, because then you won't come off as

21:06.680 --> 21:10.400
desperate and you'll have the confidence to really talk with people.

21:10.400 --> 21:14.520
Also, a great thing to have in your room, Goldeneye.

21:14.520 --> 21:15.520
That's what I was going to say.

21:15.520 --> 21:16.520
Set up a Goldeneye tournament.

21:16.520 --> 21:17.520
I knew Travis was going to turn him in that vein.

21:17.520 --> 21:20.120
Put Goldeneye in your dorm room.

21:20.120 --> 21:24.920
I went one step further and I took my N64 to the common room and hooked it up to the

21:24.920 --> 21:27.360
TV and started playing.

21:27.360 --> 21:28.360
People filtered in.

21:28.360 --> 21:30.080
They were like, oh, what's this?

21:30.080 --> 21:32.160
Also start a poker night.

21:32.160 --> 21:33.160
Poker night would be good, too.

21:33.160 --> 21:34.160
Yeah.

21:34.160 --> 21:37.480
Something that people want to get into and try, and it's a good way to meet people.

21:37.480 --> 21:44.120
There's also, Richard, a ton of... Any university is going to have a ton of clubs and stuff

21:44.120 --> 21:46.120
like that.

21:46.120 --> 21:51.640
The people on your floor, they'll be good as starters, but college is so broad and so

21:51.640 --> 21:57.760
much broader than high school, which you're used to, that you are going to make general

21:57.760 --> 22:01.760
friends there, but you're going to want to specify a little bit when you're making your

22:01.760 --> 22:03.800
lifelong college friends.

22:03.800 --> 22:06.360
The people on your dorm are just geographically close.

22:06.360 --> 22:13.080
The people who you meet in music club for fans of Dave Matthews Band Cuts, they're going

22:13.080 --> 22:17.200
to be people who really share your interests and better friends.

22:17.200 --> 22:23.000
You said clubs, which made me think of nightclubs, which sent me down this vein that I really

22:23.000 --> 22:25.040
think you could get into.

22:25.040 --> 22:32.240
It would require a bit of an investment, maybe a $200 investment, but go out and buy a whole

22:32.240 --> 22:42.640
bunch of fancy liquors, like a gin or a scotch or a scotchka, and then you arrange them in

22:42.640 --> 22:47.560
your room, like a bar, and you could turn your dorm room into a speakeasy.

22:47.560 --> 22:51.560
That's actually a pretty good idea, actually.

22:51.560 --> 22:55.840
That's actually a good way to get out of going to college, if you wanted to be a short stag,

22:55.840 --> 22:57.480
because you will be asked to leave.

22:57.480 --> 23:03.160
No, if he's at university and he's in some Britain country where they can drink all the

23:03.160 --> 23:04.160
time.

23:04.160 --> 23:06.800
The drinking age there is four in a beer garden.

23:06.800 --> 23:09.840
You can be a beer gardener at four years old.

23:09.840 --> 23:11.400
Some kids are born in beer gardens.

23:11.400 --> 23:13.720
Hey, get that toddler a brewski.

23:13.720 --> 23:17.520
I want to have an underwater birth at a beer garden.

23:17.520 --> 23:21.080
I would like to be born into a vat of fresh penis.

23:21.080 --> 23:22.080
I hate to bring it.

23:22.080 --> 23:23.080
It's a little bit late.

23:23.080 --> 23:24.080
Yeah.

23:24.080 --> 23:25.080
Damn it.

23:25.080 --> 23:30.240
What's the best way to get over a girl you're madly in love with and one day her feelings

23:30.240 --> 23:31.800
just changed and she needed a break?

23:31.800 --> 23:33.200
I'm hurting, bim bam.

23:33.200 --> 23:34.200
Help me.

23:34.200 --> 23:35.200
This is from Dex, Gmail, Griffin.

23:35.200 --> 23:36.200
You know what he needs to do.

23:36.200 --> 23:37.520
You have come to the right place.

23:37.520 --> 23:42.280
Well, the obvious answer is pack up those bags and get out of town.

23:42.280 --> 23:47.200
You had a good run, but it's all over now.

23:47.200 --> 23:52.400
The other thing you can do is surround yourself with dudes, which again, you've come to the

23:52.400 --> 23:56.120
right place because the three of us will just rail on that girl.

23:56.120 --> 24:06.880
Just that bitch, that awful, mean, I'm not the right person for this, but go find your

24:06.880 --> 24:07.880
bros.

24:07.880 --> 24:08.880
Wait, wait, wait.

24:08.880 --> 24:11.360
What if what if he introduced her to the show while they were together?

24:11.360 --> 24:12.360
We don't really mean it.

24:12.360 --> 24:13.360
Fuck.

24:13.360 --> 24:14.360
No, we didn't mean to go.

24:14.360 --> 24:15.360
He's here.

24:15.360 --> 24:16.360
Listen up.

24:16.360 --> 24:17.360
He's her.

24:17.360 --> 24:18.360
Hey, hey, he's hurting girl.

24:18.360 --> 24:19.360
You know it is.

24:19.360 --> 24:20.360
No, you know what?

24:20.360 --> 24:21.360
I'm taking sides.

24:21.360 --> 24:22.360
Oh, wow.

24:22.360 --> 24:23.360
Right.

24:23.360 --> 24:24.360
Listen, you broke his.

24:24.360 --> 24:27.200
You done broke his heart and you should feel terrible about it.

24:27.200 --> 24:29.200
Dex taking her side.

24:29.200 --> 24:30.200
Taking her side.

24:30.200 --> 24:31.200
No, I'm taking Dex's.

24:31.200 --> 24:32.200
Not good enough for you, girl.

24:32.200 --> 24:33.200
I'm taking her side.

24:33.200 --> 24:37.400
I'm going to say I will stay neutral here and say you guys should maybe talk it out.

24:37.400 --> 24:38.880
See if there's still a spark there.

24:38.880 --> 24:39.880
Justin.

24:39.880 --> 24:40.880
All right.

24:40.880 --> 24:41.880
Let's talk it out.

24:41.880 --> 24:42.880
Her feelings are changed.

24:42.880 --> 24:43.880
Listen, listen.

24:43.880 --> 24:44.880
My feelings have changed.

24:44.880 --> 24:48.440
We had a good run together, but now I'm looking to move on.

24:48.440 --> 24:50.520
I want to fuck Jerry and accounts receivable.

24:50.520 --> 24:51.520
Griffin.

24:51.520 --> 24:53.600
Listen, he is all over the place.

24:53.600 --> 24:57.760
I'm the only one who can give you what you want, what you need, what you have to have,

24:57.760 --> 24:58.760
what you got to get.

24:58.760 --> 24:59.880
It's not there.

24:59.880 --> 25:00.880
I cannot.

25:00.880 --> 25:01.880
I can't.

25:01.880 --> 25:02.880
I got to feel.

25:02.880 --> 25:03.880
Let's stay positive.

25:03.880 --> 25:05.360
Let's stay positive here.

25:05.360 --> 25:06.520
Griffin, go.

25:06.520 --> 25:09.000
Let's let's let's take a five minute recess.

25:09.000 --> 25:11.400
OK, but I want to come back to this.

25:11.400 --> 25:13.880
I don't want to just shut it out, just like everything else.

25:13.880 --> 25:17.840
Why did you never open up to me, Dex, Dex?

25:17.840 --> 25:20.560
I feel like we've made a lot of good progress here.

25:20.560 --> 25:21.800
You've got to open up to her, Dex.

25:21.800 --> 25:22.800
You got to.

25:22.800 --> 25:25.440
You've got to open up as you're packing your bags.

25:25.440 --> 25:26.440
And can I know?

25:26.440 --> 25:27.440
Let her go.

25:27.440 --> 25:28.440
Let her go.

25:28.440 --> 25:29.440
Don't open up to her.

25:29.440 --> 25:30.440
Let her go.

25:30.440 --> 25:31.440
It's over.

25:31.440 --> 25:32.440
Get away.

25:32.440 --> 25:33.440
Get away real quick.

25:33.440 --> 25:34.440
I'm packing.

25:34.440 --> 25:35.440
I'm moving away forever.

25:35.440 --> 25:37.920
I want to open up while closing this box.

25:37.920 --> 25:38.920
Toss it all.

25:38.920 --> 25:39.920
Toss your cares.

25:39.920 --> 25:43.960
Toss your worries and your woes into that big black Samsonite.

25:43.960 --> 25:45.140
You are done.

25:45.140 --> 25:47.000
We get a lot of questions.

25:47.000 --> 25:48.000
Your name is Dex.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.760
You can fuck anybody you want whenever you want.

25:50.760 --> 25:51.760
Dex.

25:51.760 --> 25:56.940
The the the answer to this question is really cliche, but unfortunately it's time.

25:56.940 --> 25:59.960
It's time and getting lots of strange.

25:59.960 --> 26:03.560
Whoa, I'm half with you.

26:03.560 --> 26:09.520
Which I really, I really miss my old girlfriend and I have a VD.

26:09.520 --> 26:10.520
I don't feel better.

26:10.520 --> 26:13.680
I do not miss my untainted penis.

26:13.680 --> 26:14.960
I miss my untainted.

26:14.960 --> 26:20.520
OK, then let's do anything but don't sleep with lots of women, but get flirted with by

26:20.520 --> 26:21.520
lots of women.

26:21.520 --> 26:22.960
Flirt with lots of women.

26:22.960 --> 26:27.560
Just get the attention of other women until you feel happy and desirable again.

26:27.560 --> 26:31.000
Hey, this is this is an interesting coincidence.

26:31.000 --> 26:34.360
This is from Gmail.

26:34.360 --> 26:40.440
There's this guy at work that was just really nice and now he's become my occupational stalker.

26:40.440 --> 26:43.760
I'm a secretary and I sent out mass emails to our floor.

26:43.760 --> 26:47.320
He always respond replies with personal suggestive replies.

26:47.320 --> 26:50.280
I'm married and I don't want to embarrass him.

26:50.280 --> 26:52.320
Plus it's not quite sexual harassment.

26:52.320 --> 26:54.780
It's just flirty old man creepy.

26:54.780 --> 27:00.720
How do I make him stop emailing me weird messages?

27:00.720 --> 27:01.720
You got to forward it.

27:01.720 --> 27:04.360
You got to forward his responses.

27:04.360 --> 27:08.640
And then and then when he gets uncomfortable, say, oh, I thought you were joking.

27:08.640 --> 27:09.640
Yeah.

27:09.640 --> 27:14.240
Just, yeah, you got to you got to forward them.

27:14.240 --> 27:17.780
Or you could do something where like.

27:17.780 --> 27:25.760
You accidentally reply all to one of the emails that he sends you and just say, like, listen,

27:25.760 --> 27:26.760
creep.

27:26.760 --> 27:27.760
I'm not interested.

27:27.760 --> 27:33.680
And he'll be so ashamed that he may have to kill himself.

27:33.680 --> 27:34.680
That's really the end game.

27:34.680 --> 27:40.120
Kind of a scorched earth policy that you're off of stalking.

27:40.120 --> 27:45.160
Yeah, I don't I've never worked in an office before.

27:45.160 --> 27:51.680
Sometimes sometimes Justin sends me weird emails, but I keep those and keep those locked

27:51.680 --> 27:52.680
away.

27:52.680 --> 27:54.080
Just tell him it's really sad.

27:54.080 --> 27:55.080
That's the best thing you do.

27:55.080 --> 27:57.000
If you say no, then it's like you're playing a game.

27:57.000 --> 28:01.160
But if you're like, I this is honestly kind of depresses me when you send these because

28:01.160 --> 28:05.920
there's it's so out of the realm of possibility that I would ever look at you with anything

28:05.920 --> 28:09.720
other than contempt and just make him feel really ashamed of himself.

28:09.720 --> 28:11.460
You know what I mean?

28:11.460 --> 28:12.460
Is he rich?

28:12.460 --> 28:16.920
You're his grandson from the future.

28:16.920 --> 28:19.360
This is Travis's do pack your bags and move away.

28:19.360 --> 28:20.360
Yeah, I like it.

28:20.360 --> 28:23.200
I think it can be applied to many situations.

28:23.200 --> 28:26.640
Because here's the thing, even if he knows that it's blatantly not true.

28:26.640 --> 28:27.640
What?

28:27.640 --> 28:29.680
No, I think it's a lady.

28:29.680 --> 28:30.680
Okay.

28:30.680 --> 28:33.840
It says secretary and have you ever heard of something so farcical and ridiculous as

28:33.840 --> 28:36.000
a male secretary?

28:36.000 --> 28:37.000
Get real.

28:37.000 --> 28:38.000
Okay.

28:38.000 --> 28:39.440
Hey, here's a pretty smooth transition.

28:39.440 --> 28:43.680
Here's a Yahoo Answers question that was sent in by Eric near.

28:43.680 --> 28:45.260
Thank you, Eric near.

28:45.260 --> 28:54.000
It's by Yahoo Answers user Ben Edwards, who asks, I think so he's not positive, but he

28:54.000 --> 28:57.720
thinks that he is in love with a goose.

28:57.720 --> 29:03.880
What should he do?

29:03.880 --> 29:05.600
You know what it is?

29:05.600 --> 29:07.880
It's that fucking neck man.

29:07.880 --> 29:08.880
Oh my god.

29:08.880 --> 29:09.880
But couldn't it swallow?

29:09.880 --> 29:10.880
Right?

29:10.880 --> 29:12.720
Well, I mean, I'm not even talking about the length.

29:12.720 --> 29:15.280
I'm talking about the elegant curvature.

29:15.280 --> 29:16.280
Oh my god.

29:16.280 --> 29:20.800
Look, which is it's like exactly what I have is that elegant curvature or it would work

29:20.800 --> 29:21.840
out really well.

29:21.840 --> 29:24.680
It's like a mysterious sexy question mark.

29:24.680 --> 29:28.040
Hey, I'll tell you what you need to do.

29:28.040 --> 29:29.560
Can you reread the question, Griffin?

29:29.560 --> 29:30.560
Sure.

29:30.560 --> 29:31.560
I think.

29:31.560 --> 29:32.560
Okay.

29:32.560 --> 29:34.040
Here's our operative word here.

29:34.040 --> 29:35.400
Here's what you do.

29:35.400 --> 29:38.760
You need to shore this shit up and figure out if you're in love with a goose.

29:38.760 --> 29:43.800
Take a long look in the deep, dark, truthful mirror and think about whether or not you

29:43.800 --> 29:46.280
want to stick that goose's beak in your butthole.

29:46.280 --> 29:48.260
Do you want to fuck a goose or not?

29:48.260 --> 29:49.920
This is not something you're equivocal on.

29:49.920 --> 29:51.280
It's something you know.

29:51.280 --> 29:52.280
Do you want to fuck the goose?

29:52.280 --> 29:53.280
I'm up now.

29:53.280 --> 29:54.280
Yes or no?

29:54.280 --> 29:57.280
I'm on the fence on my position on goose fucking.

29:57.280 --> 29:58.280
Okay.

29:58.280 --> 29:59.280
No, wait.

29:59.280 --> 30:00.280
No, we don't know.

30:00.280 --> 30:01.280
He wants to fuck it.

30:01.280 --> 30:02.720
He may just want to be in love with the goose.

30:02.720 --> 30:05.000
There's lots of different love.

30:05.000 --> 30:06.000
There's lots of different love.

30:06.000 --> 30:07.000
That's so true, Travis.

30:07.000 --> 30:08.000
Maybe such a good point.

30:08.000 --> 30:09.000
Maybe he just wants to adopt the goose.

30:09.000 --> 30:10.000
One of those types is goose love.

30:10.000 --> 30:11.000
Maybe he just wants to adopt the goose.

30:11.000 --> 30:12.000
Have a goose baby.

30:12.000 --> 30:13.000
The thing is he dreams about it all the time.

30:13.000 --> 30:14.520
He dreams about it all the time.

30:14.520 --> 30:16.240
So what is he dreaming about it?

30:16.240 --> 30:20.760
Like he's going antique shopping at flea markets with his love goose?

30:20.760 --> 30:21.760
Yeah.

30:21.760 --> 30:22.760
Okay.

30:22.760 --> 30:23.760
Yeah.

30:23.760 --> 30:24.760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

30:24.760 --> 30:25.760
This is fine.

30:25.760 --> 30:26.760
Give him a little suit.

30:26.760 --> 30:27.760
I mean, it's not fine.

30:27.760 --> 30:28.760
It's not fine, Justin.

30:28.760 --> 30:29.760
It's not fine.

30:29.760 --> 30:30.760
He's talking about a goose.

30:30.760 --> 30:31.760
By the way, side note.

30:31.760 --> 30:37.920
The guy who wrote in asking for names for his band, Love Goose, is an awesome name.

30:37.920 --> 30:42.360
You can put a little Jordy LaForge visor on it and say it's your goose son for the

30:42.360 --> 30:43.360
future.

30:43.360 --> 30:45.720
Well, that one didn't work quite so well.

30:45.720 --> 30:46.720
It works for me.

30:46.720 --> 30:47.880
It works for me.

30:47.880 --> 30:53.840
He comes from a weird Island of Dr. Moreau-esque future where man-animal hybrids are the same.

30:53.840 --> 30:57.360
He has the brain of a man or a woman, if you don't want to be gay.

30:57.360 --> 31:00.040
A gay goose lover is the worst.

31:00.040 --> 31:01.360
I want a hetero goose lover.

31:01.360 --> 31:02.360
He's only into lady goose.

31:02.360 --> 31:03.360
Hey, I'm no weirdo.

31:03.360 --> 31:06.960
I'm going to fuck a lady goose.

31:06.960 --> 31:08.720
I'm not an aberration to God.

31:08.720 --> 31:11.040
What kind of deviant shit do you think I'm into?

31:11.040 --> 31:13.360
I only fuck female gooses.

31:13.360 --> 31:14.360
Geeses.

31:14.360 --> 31:15.360
Geese.

31:15.360 --> 31:16.360
Geese.

31:16.360 --> 31:17.360
No homo or nothing.

31:17.360 --> 31:18.440
I just want a fucking goose.

31:18.440 --> 31:21.840
I just like to fuck a goose down there.

31:21.840 --> 31:25.120
I like to kick back with a cold brew and fuck a goose.

31:25.120 --> 31:30.200
Just chill out, watch a game, eat some coin chips, and fuck my goose.

31:30.200 --> 31:34.280
It's been a long, hard day at work.

31:34.280 --> 31:36.920
Time for some good old-fashioned goose fucking.

31:36.920 --> 31:40.840
I say, goose, get back in the kitchen and finish making dinner, and the goose is like,

31:40.840 --> 31:41.840
I'm a goose.

31:41.840 --> 31:44.840
I can't even get to the counter.

31:44.840 --> 31:46.680
The only recipe I know is seeds.

31:46.680 --> 31:47.680
Goose.

31:47.680 --> 31:48.680
Goose, where's all my bread?

31:48.680 --> 31:51.240
Ah, you ate it again.

31:51.240 --> 31:52.240
Get over here.

31:52.240 --> 31:53.240
I'm going to fuck you.

31:53.240 --> 31:57.800
Goose, I told you not to eat that bowl of Sun Chips we left out, that's for guests.

31:57.800 --> 32:01.200
Goose, quit walking in a line with other geese.

32:01.200 --> 32:02.200
Get over here.

32:02.200 --> 32:03.200
I'm trying to fuck.

32:03.200 --> 32:04.200
Get over here.

32:04.200 --> 32:05.200
You're mine.

32:05.200 --> 32:06.200
I lost you.

32:06.200 --> 32:09.520
I'm in love with one of you, I'm going to have to fuck all of you to figure out which

32:09.520 --> 32:10.520
one.

32:10.520 --> 32:11.520
Oh no.

32:11.520 --> 32:12.520
Oh god.

32:12.520 --> 32:16.560
I'm just sick of the neighborhood kids spray-painting goose fucker on my porch.

32:16.560 --> 32:20.800
Well, I wouldn't mind if they would stop writing gay goose fucker.

32:20.800 --> 32:21.800
Don't they get it?

32:21.800 --> 32:22.800
Let's be clear.

32:22.800 --> 32:29.720
Listen, I'm at church every day with my goose wife in a dress next to me while the

32:29.720 --> 32:30.720
reverend preaches.

32:30.720 --> 32:34.080
I can't listen that close because all I can think about is how bad I want to get down

32:34.080 --> 32:35.080
on this goose.

32:35.080 --> 32:37.600
It's Adam and geese, not Adam and Steve.

32:37.600 --> 32:44.160
Okay, that's it, the show is about to be over.

32:44.160 --> 32:46.080
That has to be where we start the show.

32:46.080 --> 32:48.200
We have to draw the line unless we draw it there.

32:48.200 --> 32:54.200
Few housekeeping notes before we hear Griffin's last question.

32:54.200 --> 33:02.640
It's always great to have your support, it's great to have you listening, we super, super

33:02.640 --> 33:05.960
appreciate it.

33:05.960 --> 33:11.720
Everything you need to know if you want to ask a question is on nbnbam.com.

33:11.720 --> 33:16.000
There are still t-shirts, we would love it if you wanted to wear that.

33:16.000 --> 33:19.280
And if you've already got one, send us, I want like more pictures, we're going to try

33:19.280 --> 33:24.520
to get together a gallery to host on the website.

33:24.520 --> 33:29.400
So if you've got pictures of you wearing a My Brother, My Brother, Me shirt in a funny

33:29.400 --> 33:35.920
locale or you put it on a baby, we love everything like that so send those to us.

33:35.920 --> 33:39.920
Also we're instituting a new program this week.

33:39.920 --> 33:45.840
We got the idea from our buddy Jeff Monolog and he had a party, a MBMBAM party and we

33:45.840 --> 33:54.200
recorded a little special message to them and this is an offer we'd like to extend to

33:54.200 --> 33:55.200
everyone.

33:55.200 --> 34:00.440
So if you are having a party for My Brother, My Brother, Me, a My Brother, My Brother,

34:00.440 --> 34:06.920
Me listening party, we will let us know ahead of time, we'll record a special greeting just

34:06.920 --> 34:07.920
for you.

34:07.920 --> 34:10.440
It has, let's see, what's a party?

34:10.440 --> 34:14.640
We need some parameters, yeah, because it can't just be you invite Rosie over to your

34:14.640 --> 34:15.640
cubicle to listen.

34:15.640 --> 34:24.040
The Bible says anytime two or more are gathered in my name, I'll be there too, that's God.

34:24.040 --> 34:25.360
We're bigger than the Beatles.

34:25.360 --> 34:26.360
The Beatles are bigger than Jesus.

34:26.360 --> 34:27.360
Is Jesus bigger than God?

34:27.360 --> 34:28.360
Five people.

34:28.360 --> 34:29.360
Yeah.

34:29.360 --> 34:30.360
Sam's gonna say four.

34:30.360 --> 34:31.360
Five.

34:31.360 --> 34:34.360
No, I think four is a good number.

34:34.360 --> 34:35.360
I think four is around four.

34:35.360 --> 34:36.360
No, five.

34:36.360 --> 34:37.360
One is the host, four guests.

34:37.360 --> 34:38.360
Okay.

34:38.360 --> 34:39.360
No, no, no.

34:39.360 --> 34:40.800
I don't think that's gonna, I don't think it's gonna happen.

34:40.800 --> 34:44.000
I think it's gonna be three people who listen to the show who invite their one friend over.

34:44.000 --> 34:46.480
Okay, we'll do four, we'll say four.

34:46.480 --> 34:51.700
Four people and let us know, you know, names or whatever, you can email that to us and the

34:51.700 --> 34:56.440
only thing we ask is afterwards, we're gonna need a picture.

34:56.440 --> 34:58.240
Pics or it didn't happen.

34:58.240 --> 34:59.240
Pics or it didn't happen.

34:59.240 --> 35:01.160
Gotta have something of bim bam in there.

35:01.160 --> 35:04.120
And if you can, invite somebody new into the fold.

35:04.120 --> 35:05.520
Yeah, right, right, right.

35:05.520 --> 35:06.520
That's the idea.

35:06.520 --> 35:07.700
I mean, it's absolutely, it's crazy.

35:07.700 --> 35:15.680
It's absolutely insane that people are having parties that are centered around us talking

35:15.680 --> 35:17.040
for 40 minutes.

35:17.040 --> 35:19.760
That's completely bananas to me already, but.

35:19.760 --> 35:22.280
That's how every party I go to ends up.

35:22.280 --> 35:26.120
Try and get some new people, even if you don't have a party, just try and get some new people

35:26.120 --> 35:30.120
on the show cause we don't, we don't have any way of getting new, new people on board

35:30.120 --> 35:31.120
other than Jeff.

35:31.120 --> 35:35.160
Mod Locks, uh, weekly move in, bam, listening party is blowing up.

35:35.160 --> 35:44.360
He's got seven guests, Brendan, Henry, Zach, David, Jeff, Michael, Robbie, huge party.

35:44.360 --> 35:47.120
As long as you keep inviting me, I'm going to keep saying maybe.

35:47.120 --> 35:49.600
So feel free to use that.

35:49.600 --> 35:52.440
So, so yeah, send that to us and uh, you know what we'll do.

35:52.440 --> 35:57.440
We'll put something on the, on the website or on the Facebook that has the, the dates.

35:57.440 --> 36:02.560
Um, if you want to get down on this program, I want to throw out a couple of Twitter shout

36:02.560 --> 36:04.820
outs for people that have been pimping the show.

36:04.820 --> 36:10.160
First of all, um, anyone who's looking for new and interesting people to follow on Twitter,

36:10.160 --> 36:15.840
search hashtag MB, MB, AM, and then follow every single person that mentions the show.

36:15.840 --> 36:18.600
Uh, but some, it's a community, some specific people.

36:18.600 --> 36:23.240
Uh, of course I want to think Brent O'Floss, uh, you follow Fridays, that's every Friday.

36:23.240 --> 36:24.400
He's a great guy.

36:24.400 --> 36:30.760
Um, Matthew Vose, um, talking about the week re-energizing us.

36:30.760 --> 36:37.520
Um, Hill Thins, H I L T H E N S, um, big fan of the show, Atomic Fox.

36:37.520 --> 36:40.880
I want to throw that out just because he just realized that there's a connection between

36:40.880 --> 36:43.360
joystick and MB, MB, AM.

36:43.360 --> 36:44.360
What is it?

36:44.360 --> 36:47.640
I, I don't know what it is, but he's keeping it to himself.

36:47.640 --> 36:54.080
Um, office of nature, uh, not only talked about my bim bam, but try to get son of buzzo

36:54.080 --> 36:55.080
on board.

36:55.080 --> 36:56.080
I don't know.

36:56.080 --> 37:00.080
Now, whenever I see someone asking, yeah, you got to spread the, gotta get that follow

37:00.080 --> 37:01.080
up.

37:01.080 --> 37:02.080
Yeah.

37:02.080 --> 37:03.080
You got to jump them.

37:03.080 --> 37:04.080
You just got to hook them up.

37:04.080 --> 37:09.960
Um, so go to our website, mobimbam.com or mbmbam.com.

37:09.960 --> 37:15.680
It's got all of our contact information, uh, email us at mbmbam at gmail.com.

37:15.680 --> 37:19.560
We read every single email, um, even if we don't get to them on the show, we are, the

37:19.560 --> 37:23.120
number of emails is increasing exponentially every week.

37:23.120 --> 37:28.280
Um, so if we don't get to it, uh, we apologize, but we do read them, uh, and, and your, your

37:28.280 --> 37:30.160
problems are in our thoughts.

37:30.160 --> 37:33.960
If you email us about a listening party, make sure you put in bmbam listening party in the,

37:33.960 --> 37:36.160
in the, in the headlines would make sure to see it.

37:36.160 --> 37:38.500
And we got some more voicemails this week.

37:38.500 --> 37:39.500
We did.

37:39.500 --> 37:40.500
We got a bunch.

37:40.500 --> 37:42.860
Uh, they were a little long.

37:42.860 --> 37:47.920
They were, uh, in like the three minute range.

37:47.920 --> 37:52.760
Most of them, which are cool to listen to, but, um, it's hard to turn into a question

37:52.760 --> 37:53.760
on the show.

37:53.760 --> 37:56.640
So, so if you can try and try and keep it brief, unless you don't want a question on

37:56.640 --> 38:01.880
the show, unless you just want to chat to our voicemail, uh, that that number is 203,

38:01.880 --> 38:07.040
um, a bmbam one or two zero three M B M B A M one.

38:07.040 --> 38:09.200
Um, and that's it.

38:09.200 --> 38:10.200
So that's it.

38:10.200 --> 38:11.200
Uh, Griffin.

38:11.200 --> 38:13.120
May I hear that last question?

38:13.120 --> 38:14.400
Uh, sure.

38:14.400 --> 38:17.600

Thank you.

38:21.600 --> 38:22.600
Mr. Baseball 3030.

Uh, Yahoo answers user dead Barbie asks, what are the benefits of circumcising a hamster?

38:30.320 --> 38:33.800
I think that's obvious.

38:33.800 --> 38:40.120
I'm Travis McElroy, I'm Griffin McElroy.

38:40.120 --> 38:46.720
