00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:48.800
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Mean Advice Show for the modern era.

00:48.800 --> 00:55.280
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

00:55.280 --> 00:58.640
I'm your sweet baby brother, and 30 under 30 media luminary, Griffin McElroy. I'm gonna say

00:58.640 --> 01:04.720
my name normal, so. I just like, if you string my name together, it sounds like Travis McElroy.

01:04.720 --> 01:09.280
Oh, that's fun. Yeah, right? Are you boys excited to go to...

01:11.280 --> 01:17.680
Which is what I just sort of, like, because I'm so familiar with it, I call San Diego Comic-Con,

01:18.400 --> 01:26.000
the 2017 edition. Are you boys all hyped up to, for the comic, that new comic smell?

01:26.000 --> 01:32.880
Excelsior! Excelsior is what I always say. Did you know that every comic-con attendee

01:34.080 --> 01:41.200
in their visit will get a complimentary Stanley cameo? You gotta keep your eyes peeled,

01:41.200 --> 01:47.440
but he will, maybe he'll be the one serving you chicken tenders in the conference center.

01:47.440 --> 01:52.560
Maybe he'll be your driver, your Uber. Maybe he'll wake up and he'll be standing over you

01:52.560 --> 01:57.920
in your hotel room. If you see an old man and you wonder, who are you talking to?

01:57.920 --> 02:01.600
That is probably Stanley, because I kind of wonder, people in the Marvel movies,

02:01.600 --> 02:06.480
like, who is that old man talking to? I've always got my head on a swiv,

02:06.480 --> 02:12.640
looking for Stanley. Are you... What do you think Stanley's last name is?

02:13.440 --> 02:17.200
No one knows, and that's what makes him such an exciting artist. So...

02:17.200 --> 02:23.920
It's Lieber. I want to make sure we don't all dress up

02:23.920 --> 02:31.280
as the same action hero, and so I was hoping we could take some time here for our Cosplay Corner,

02:31.280 --> 02:34.720
which is a segment we haven't done in a while, huh?

02:35.360 --> 02:39.040
Yeah. I was just wondering who you boys are gonna do.

02:39.040 --> 02:41.760
I got mine all planned out this year. Okay.

02:41.760 --> 02:46.480
The cape. But... Jesus Christ.

02:46.480 --> 02:50.560
So I am going as the cape, which you may remember from the series The Cape,

02:51.120 --> 02:56.480
but this is gonna be confusing, and I'm still sort of struggling with how to communicate this

02:56.480 --> 03:01.600
vis-a-vis my dress. I've got 10 episodes of sort of, like, material to work with.

03:01.600 --> 03:05.600
Not much. Not a lot. A lot of time you want a richer canon,

03:05.600 --> 03:08.000
so you can sneak a lot of Easter eggs into your garb.

03:08.000 --> 03:14.240
But I don't think they had time to really develop those, to nurture and incubate those eggs.

03:14.240 --> 03:19.280
So the thing is that I'm cosplaying as the cape from The Cape.

03:20.080 --> 03:24.640
Not the cape, the character, but the cape's cape called The Cape.

03:24.640 --> 03:26.480
Lower case t, lower case c.

03:27.280 --> 03:31.920
Right. The cape from The Cape, the cancelled TV series.

03:33.120 --> 03:34.320
How's that grab you all?

03:34.320 --> 03:37.440
Oh, it grabs me so good, just like The Cape didn't.

03:37.440 --> 03:44.960
I have a really exciting one, and it's taken a really long time,

03:44.960 --> 03:48.480
and I've spent, boys, thousands of tens of dollars.

03:50.080 --> 03:52.400
I'm gonna be, I think, just Zachary Quinto.

03:52.960 --> 03:53.440
Nice.

03:53.440 --> 03:53.680
Okay.

03:54.240 --> 04:05.120
Not as a Star Trek Spock or as a heroes guy, but just Zachary Quinto.

04:05.120 --> 04:08.480
And I don't know if a lot of people, do folks do that typically?

04:08.480 --> 04:11.040
Like, hi, I'm Will Wheaton.

04:11.040 --> 04:12.240
And people are like, oh, it's so exciting.

04:12.240 --> 04:13.440
Wait a minute.

04:13.440 --> 04:14.640
Like, no, you don't understand that.

04:14.640 --> 04:14.880
No.

04:15.520 --> 04:16.480
I just damn him.

04:16.480 --> 04:18.480
Be a good year for your Elijah Wood cosplay, Griffin.

04:19.440 --> 04:22.640
Yeah, I mean, every year's a good year for my Elijah Wood cosplay, Justin.

04:22.640 --> 04:23.680
It's my life.

04:23.680 --> 04:27.200
Do you think Zachary Quinto walks around in Spock ears just like,

04:27.200 --> 04:28.960
ah, nanu-nanu, right, idiots?

04:28.960 --> 04:29.680
Anyway, get bent.

04:32.480 --> 04:34.640
That would be my entire comic-con experience.

04:34.640 --> 04:36.560
Anybody got any cats I can eat?

04:36.560 --> 04:38.960
Because, oh, that wasn't him.

04:38.960 --> 04:40.000
That wasn't Spock who did it.

04:40.000 --> 04:40.560
It was Alf.

04:41.200 --> 04:42.240
It was Alf who did that.

04:42.240 --> 04:43.360
Thanks for the money.

04:43.360 --> 04:46.720
I'm going, my cosplay this year is, I'm gonna go as Superman.

04:48.160 --> 04:55.040
But I'm going as Superman, like, right in the middle of changing from Clark Kent to Superman.

04:55.040 --> 05:01.120
So I'm out of my Clark Kent clothes, but I haven't yet gotten into my Superman outfit yet.

05:01.120 --> 05:05.840
Hmm, I think if you cosplay as Superman in one of these things, you should just be asked to leave.

05:06.400 --> 05:07.360
Yeah, we get it.

05:07.360 --> 05:08.320
Yeah, Superman is cool.

05:08.320 --> 05:09.280
We get it.

05:09.280 --> 05:12.240
It is the equivalent of dressing up as a ghost on Halloween.

05:12.240 --> 05:15.200
Just because it's like, oh, oh.

05:15.200 --> 05:16.800
What if I'm just super naked?

05:17.760 --> 05:20.400
Well, yeah, yeah.

05:21.040 --> 05:23.600
Hey, are we going to cosplay at, we're going to be-

05:23.600 --> 05:24.400
Let me be clear.

05:24.400 --> 05:27.200
I'm going to shave my chest hair into the ass.

05:28.240 --> 05:29.040
Now we're talking.

05:29.040 --> 05:31.760
Yeah, so it'll be, and my bush.

05:31.760 --> 05:34.160
Now we're talking about something real upsetting.

05:35.520 --> 05:39.280
So we are actually going to be, I should mention now while I'm thinking about it,

05:39.280 --> 05:40.640
we're going to be at Comic-Con.

05:42.800 --> 05:43.360
When is it?

05:44.000 --> 05:48.160
Saturday, well, we're going to be there, like, you know, all the days.

05:48.160 --> 05:55.200
But Saturday at noon, we are going to be at the first second booth representing the Adventure Zone.

05:55.200 --> 05:56.000
So come say hi.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.920
Are we going to cosplay for that?

05:57.920 --> 05:58.240
Are we?

05:58.240 --> 05:59.440
Should we cosplay?

05:59.440 --> 05:59.680
Yeah.

05:59.680 --> 06:01.280
Ooh, probably.

06:01.280 --> 06:02.080
That could be fun.

06:02.080 --> 06:04.400
I mean, we will have done a live Adventure Zone the night before,

06:04.400 --> 06:07.600
so y'all will definitely have your costume.

06:07.600 --> 06:10.880
And it will smell of show funk, so that'll be nice.

06:10.880 --> 06:13.360
If you cosplay, be sure to come.

06:13.360 --> 06:15.920
And like, if you see us walking around, I don't want any of this like,

06:15.920 --> 06:18.640
I saw you guys, but I didn't want to bother you.

06:18.640 --> 06:21.040
If you're dressed as a character from the Adventure Zone,

06:21.040 --> 06:23.280
you come say hi, let us get a picture with you.

06:23.280 --> 06:24.000
Or not.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
I mean, like, if you want to say hi, just say hi.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.480
Just come and say hi, there's no rules just right.

06:28.480 --> 06:29.120
No rules here.

06:29.120 --> 06:31.120
Trav, have you been to Sandy or Comic-Con before?

06:31.120 --> 06:32.320
I have, I went last year.

06:32.320 --> 06:35.520
Okay, is it just, be straight with me.

06:36.320 --> 06:39.600
You know me and my proclivities.

06:40.400 --> 06:43.520
My special, my sort of whole thing.

06:43.520 --> 06:49.120
Is it just going to be a full blown, pedal to the metal, McG's shit show?

06:49.120 --> 06:51.680
Like, is that what I'm anticipating here?

06:52.320 --> 06:53.120
No, no, no, no, no.

06:53.680 --> 06:54.240
No?

06:54.240 --> 06:54.720
No.

06:54.720 --> 06:58.080
It's going to be a medium pedal to the metal shit show.

06:58.080 --> 06:59.040
But not full blown.

07:00.400 --> 07:03.040
How many times am I going to run into Nathan Fillion in the bathroom?

07:03.040 --> 07:06.480
Because I know it's going, oh, that's too many.

07:07.200 --> 07:07.760
That's too many times.

07:07.760 --> 07:09.680
Why are you both going to the bathroom?

07:09.680 --> 07:12.160
That's because he just stays in the bathroom.

07:12.160 --> 07:15.680
Hey, do you need a mint towel?

07:15.680 --> 07:16.640
What do you need?

07:16.640 --> 07:17.680
I don't work here.

07:18.880 --> 07:20.480
That's a good, both of you did real good.

07:20.480 --> 07:22.480
Nathan Fillion said, should we do?

07:22.480 --> 07:29.040
Oh, we should also say right here at the top, we're also going to be on at midnight.

07:29.040 --> 07:29.680
Oh, fuck.

07:30.400 --> 07:33.440
The 24th, July 24th.

07:33.440 --> 07:34.560
Don't ask when it's on.

07:34.560 --> 07:35.840
You'll look like an asshole.

07:36.400 --> 07:37.920
Yeah, but check it out.

07:37.920 --> 07:41.520
Watch us, the three of us competing brother against brother.

07:41.520 --> 07:44.480
It's the civil war of late night comedy shows.

07:44.480 --> 07:48.080
We don't really write jokes or do jokes ever.

07:48.080 --> 07:50.240
So that should be a fun experience.

07:50.240 --> 07:54.480
Yeah, please enjoy all of us trying to look comfortable as we appear on national television.

07:54.480 --> 07:56.000
Can I hit you guys with this?

07:57.440 --> 08:02.320
This is a true story before we get to our advice segment of the show,

08:02.320 --> 08:03.920
the ever dwindling advice segment.

08:04.560 --> 08:09.280
I was watching episodes of At Midnight and pausing after Mr.

08:09.280 --> 08:12.560
Hardwick gave the prompt to see if I could come up with a joke.

08:12.560 --> 08:13.600
Oh, man.

08:13.600 --> 08:14.320
Isn't that sad?

08:14.960 --> 08:16.000
So here's the one.

08:16.000 --> 08:20.000
I'm going to give you guys the prompt and you have to come up with your own jokes.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.320
And I'll tell you what my joke is to buy you some time.

08:22.320 --> 08:23.520
Okay, real quick, though.

08:23.520 --> 08:23.920
I do.

08:23.920 --> 08:26.720
I did just say, oh, man, not because of this segment you're doing,

08:26.720 --> 08:29.920
but because I just had to confront the fact that you are going to call him Mr.

08:29.920 --> 08:31.680
Hardwick while I'm in the room with you.

08:31.680 --> 08:33.040
And it's bad for me.

08:33.680 --> 08:35.280
Now, Chrissy boy is what he insists.

08:36.880 --> 08:44.000
Okay, so the prompt was what Pitbull, if he ran for governor of Florida,

08:44.880 --> 08:47.200
what would his campaign slogan be?

08:47.200 --> 08:51.040
And here's who you have to beat in this lineup was Howie Mandel,

08:51.040 --> 08:53.760
David Cockner, and I forget.

08:53.760 --> 08:56.240
But Howie Mandel was the main one that I was like.

08:56.240 --> 09:03.440
I would, the Sun Tzu said the first secret to war is to not get in it

09:03.440 --> 09:05.680
with a combatant who you could never hope to beat.

09:05.680 --> 09:08.080
And so I concede, of course.

09:08.720 --> 09:12.160
Okay, so that is going to be your sort of play.

09:12.160 --> 09:16.160
Because the best I could do is I know you want me as governor.

09:16.160 --> 09:17.840
And that's it. And that sucks.

09:17.840 --> 09:19.360
I'm going to be so bad on TV.

09:19.920 --> 09:20.480
Memory hurt.

09:20.480 --> 09:21.760
There's a third person.

09:21.760 --> 09:22.960
Me as governor?

09:22.960 --> 09:23.520
Yeah, right.

09:23.520 --> 09:24.880
Picture that with a Kodak.

09:26.480 --> 09:28.400
So we're going to be really bad.

09:28.400 --> 09:30.560
Comma, but I would like to be governor, please.

09:33.360 --> 09:34.320
Will Chris sue us?

09:35.040 --> 09:36.880
People have been trying to get you on this show for a long time

09:36.880 --> 09:39.200
and you stank it the fuck up.

09:39.200 --> 09:43.840
And so the show got canceled because of how bad you did.

09:43.840 --> 09:45.600
Lots of people lost their jobs.

09:45.600 --> 09:49.040
And so we need $10 million by next Tuesday.

09:49.040 --> 09:50.160
Here was my joke.

09:52.160 --> 09:54.160
Pitbull's running for governor of Florida.

09:54.160 --> 09:55.520
What's his campaign slogan?

09:56.640 --> 10:01.040
I promise to personally eat every mosquito in the state, Pitbull.

10:01.600 --> 10:02.080
Damn it.

10:02.640 --> 10:03.360
All right, Justin.

10:03.360 --> 10:06.160
Now, okay, 15 minutes is about what it's-

10:07.120 --> 10:07.760
Ah, shit.

10:07.760 --> 10:09.920
Some people link the edits.

10:11.520 --> 10:11.920
All right.

10:12.560 --> 10:14.960
You can carry us through this television experience.

10:14.960 --> 10:16.320
Let's do some advice.

10:16.320 --> 10:20.560
Yeah, I'm happy to just get in there and just do the damn thing.

10:21.360 --> 10:22.000
You guys ready?

10:22.640 --> 10:22.880
Yeah.

10:24.080 --> 10:25.440
Are you sure you're ready?

10:25.440 --> 10:26.080
Sorry, I'm looking for the question.

10:26.080 --> 10:27.600
You did not have the email ready.

10:27.600 --> 10:31.600
I work from home and one of the restaurants I go to for lunch

10:31.600 --> 10:33.680
has a guest of the month leaderboard

10:33.680 --> 10:36.080
with names and tally marks behind the register.

10:36.080 --> 10:38.000
I go here at least twice a week.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.480
I have the rewards card and they know my order

10:40.480 --> 10:42.320
without me having to give it to them,

10:42.320 --> 10:44.400
but I'm not even on the leaderboard.

10:44.400 --> 10:45.520
What do I have to do?

10:46.240 --> 10:48.960
That's from Inconsolable in Irvine.

10:51.120 --> 10:52.800
Man, you got to step it up.

10:53.360 --> 10:54.480
You got to step up your game.

10:54.480 --> 10:56.000
You got to be like that dude in Supersized

10:56.000 --> 10:59.680
when he had a billion Big Macs and just get in there.

11:01.680 --> 11:03.360
Can this be the only restaurant you eat at?

11:03.360 --> 11:04.720
What's this meal you always get?

11:04.720 --> 11:07.600
Is it perhaps a salad with all the major food groups in it

11:08.160 --> 11:10.640
but it sort of covers the whole pyramid?

11:10.640 --> 11:11.920
Because if so, you just go there

11:11.920 --> 11:14.160
and you order that for every single meal.

11:14.160 --> 11:17.040
All of a sudden you can rack up 21 a week

11:17.040 --> 11:18.080
and that's going to get you there.

11:22.640 --> 11:24.480
Maybe you need to make more of an impression.

11:24.480 --> 11:25.680
Maybe a fun outfit.

11:27.040 --> 11:30.480
Maybe you could be the Zoot Suit Panini King

11:30.480 --> 11:32.640
and every time you come in, you're like,

11:32.640 --> 11:35.840
hey mama, it's like guy or girl, doesn't matter.

11:35.840 --> 11:40.000
Hey mama, I'm ready for my Panini

11:40.000 --> 11:41.440
and then you do a spin around

11:41.440 --> 11:43.360
and then when they hand it to you, it'll be really hot

11:43.360 --> 11:45.040
or maybe it's not and you take a bite

11:45.040 --> 11:46.720
and you're like smoking.

11:46.720 --> 11:49.200
Yeah, you say, I've burned myself.

11:50.160 --> 11:53.120
You know, a lot of people look down on

11:53.120 --> 11:56.800
and remember poorly the 90s swing fascination

11:56.800 --> 12:00.400
but I think the Zoot Suit Panini Kings had a lot of hits

12:00.400 --> 12:04.320
and people just don't appreciate the work that they did,

12:04.320 --> 12:05.920
the groundwork they laid, you know?

12:06.480 --> 12:08.960
It's a shame that their bold style and vision

12:08.960 --> 12:13.120
was completely lifted wholesale by the Panini Pop and Daddies.

12:13.120 --> 12:19.040
Yeah, it led to the swing turf wars of 1999.

12:19.040 --> 12:21.920
And we lost a lot of good-

12:21.920 --> 12:23.040
Trombonists.

12:23.040 --> 12:25.360
A lot of really good ska musicians.

12:25.360 --> 12:26.320
Just kidding, I was just saying.

12:28.160 --> 12:30.560
Get that roasted red pepper on there.

12:30.560 --> 12:32.720
Check to make sure there's no hair.

12:33.520 --> 12:35.280
Grill lines, grill lines.

12:35.280 --> 12:37.680
Throw that thing on the little grill.

12:37.680 --> 12:38.880
Who's your daddy?

12:38.880 --> 12:43.440
Yes, I am.

12:43.440 --> 12:44.800
There's another part of it right there.

12:44.800 --> 12:45.840
Who'll be your daddy?

12:45.840 --> 12:48.320
Just change the tense.

12:49.040 --> 12:50.240
Who's your daddy?

12:50.240 --> 12:51.200
Yes, I will.

12:51.840 --> 12:53.040
There you go.

12:53.040 --> 12:54.400
Okay, that's not even good.

12:55.040 --> 12:56.160
Here's the thing.

12:56.160 --> 12:58.480
What you've got now, which is nice,

12:58.480 --> 13:00.560
is like you have a leaderboard.

13:00.560 --> 13:03.680
So you need to find that person who's number one

13:03.680 --> 13:06.320
and learn from them, train from them.

13:06.320 --> 13:07.840
What Travis is suggesting is you

13:07.840 --> 13:11.840
draft on them to use racing terminology.

13:11.840 --> 13:13.040
So you just follow them.

13:13.040 --> 13:14.880
And when they go to the Panera Bread,

13:15.440 --> 13:18.320
you swing in there and you order double what they eat.

13:18.320 --> 13:19.280
Yeah.

13:19.280 --> 13:22.160
You gotta eat all of it or else it doesn't count.

13:22.160 --> 13:22.960
Maybe some ink.

13:23.920 --> 13:24.560
What does that mean?

13:25.120 --> 13:25.920
Just get some ink.

13:28.320 --> 13:29.760
Just get a tattoo that's like

13:30.800 --> 13:32.560
number one fan of the Panini spot.

13:32.560 --> 13:34.240
That's gotta get you on the board at least, right?

13:35.600 --> 13:36.720
I don't like that.

13:36.720 --> 13:38.400
But it's of the month, Justin, is the problem.

13:38.400 --> 13:41.200
So you get that once, that's maybe June.

13:41.200 --> 13:42.880
What do you do for like July and August?

13:42.880 --> 13:43.280
You know what I mean?

13:43.280 --> 13:46.240
Just keep getting the same tattoo over and over again.

13:46.240 --> 13:47.280
That's crazy, Justin.

13:47.280 --> 13:49.280
I was saying I don't like how that

13:50.080 --> 13:52.080
affects the healthy spirit of competition

13:52.080 --> 13:54.480
that this place is trying to foster, right?

13:54.480 --> 14:00.960
Like if fucking, you know, Peyton Manning gets a

14:00.960 --> 14:02.640
I love the Super Bowl tattoo.

14:03.920 --> 14:05.120
I don't think they should let him

14:05.120 --> 14:06.640
just be in the Super Bowl because of that.

14:06.640 --> 14:08.560
I think I want to go on record and say

14:08.560 --> 14:09.440
I think that's wrong.

14:10.240 --> 14:11.360
So we gotta be looking.

14:11.360 --> 14:12.320
We're probably talking.

14:12.320 --> 14:14.000
Let's say we're looking at a top 10 list here.

14:14.880 --> 14:17.360
You gotta assume you're probably 11.

14:17.360 --> 14:18.400
You're in there all the time.

14:19.920 --> 14:22.720
So maybe you pick somebody on the list

14:22.720 --> 14:24.480
and August is just around the corner.

14:24.480 --> 14:28.960
Maybe they're not gonna make it in this time.

14:28.960 --> 14:31.840
Maybe they had a little accident.

14:31.840 --> 14:39.360
And maybe they decided to get paninis

14:39.360 --> 14:41.120
at another establishment.

14:41.920 --> 14:44.240
Maybe they're eating paninis with the fishes now.

14:45.040 --> 14:47.520
Because they went to that seafood restaurant.

14:47.520 --> 14:51.440
Maybe they're splitting a panini with old St. Pete.

14:51.440 --> 15:02.640
Maybe they're having some mint paninis.

15:02.640 --> 15:05.120
Our least popular option, but we're bringing it back

15:05.680 --> 15:07.920
just for you, the panini spot fans.

15:07.920 --> 15:13.280
Beat the heat this summer with a cement panini.

15:13.280 --> 15:14.960
Lose those last few LBs.

15:14.960 --> 15:18.880
Get your beach body right by trying.

15:18.880 --> 15:20.480
Eating this rocks.

15:20.480 --> 15:21.680
Eating rocks.

15:21.680 --> 15:23.680
Do you doofuses want a Yahoo?

15:23.680 --> 15:24.240
Sure.

15:24.240 --> 15:25.200
Wait, what?

15:25.200 --> 15:26.560
Here's a Yahoo from Sally.

15:26.560 --> 15:28.880
You tricked us into saying we're doofuses.

15:28.880 --> 15:30.400
It's from Seth Carlson.

15:30.400 --> 15:30.880
Thank you, Seth.

15:30.880 --> 15:32.400
It's Yahoo user Sally who says,

15:33.600 --> 15:36.320
what would become of McDonald's

15:36.320 --> 15:38.400
if they were just serving Happy Meals

15:38.400 --> 15:41.440
with characters of Family Guy and South Park

15:41.440 --> 15:42.640
for an older audience?

15:43.680 --> 15:44.240
Wait, what?

15:45.520 --> 15:46.080
What would happen?

15:46.080 --> 15:47.280
What would become of McDonald's

15:47.280 --> 15:48.800
if they were just serving Happy Meals

15:48.800 --> 15:52.320
with characters from Family Guy and South Park

15:52.320 --> 15:53.840
for an older audience?

15:53.840 --> 15:55.200
I just want to say,

15:55.200 --> 15:58.000
and we'll get to the actual meat of the question,

15:58.720 --> 16:02.560
I love when people use what would become

16:02.560 --> 16:04.640
or what has become as a phrase.

16:04.640 --> 16:06.400
It just sounds so like Edgar Allen Poe.

16:06.400 --> 16:08.400
It makes you sound like fucking Gandalf.

16:08.400 --> 16:08.640
Yeah.

16:10.960 --> 16:13.520
I want to go to McDonald's

16:13.520 --> 16:16.160
and order a burger meal and fries

16:16.160 --> 16:18.480
and still get that excitement that I used to get

16:18.480 --> 16:20.320
when I would get a little beyblade.

16:22.080 --> 16:27.440
But listen, I've put behind me my childish things.

16:27.440 --> 16:30.080
Now I want Family Guy and South Park toys.

16:30.080 --> 16:31.760
That irreverent humor.

16:31.760 --> 16:33.200
The irreverent South Park humor,

16:33.200 --> 16:35.440
and I love that, and you know I love that.

16:35.440 --> 16:39.840
But I would be so excited to pull a little quagmire

16:39.840 --> 16:41.360
out of my meal.

16:42.560 --> 16:43.840
And I think that would be really, really...

16:43.840 --> 16:44.800
And maybe he has a little button on it

16:44.800 --> 16:45.280
and you press him

16:45.280 --> 16:47.040
and he says all of his fun jokes from the show.

16:47.040 --> 16:50.000
Wait, is it the toys?

16:50.000 --> 16:53.920
I thought the box art on the Happy Meal would be...

16:53.920 --> 16:56.720
Yeah, Travis, it's a Happy Meal without a toy in it.

16:56.720 --> 16:57.360
No, no, no.

16:57.360 --> 17:00.080
This is why I did call you a doofus before we started.

17:00.080 --> 17:01.840
But that would be good for adults

17:01.840 --> 17:06.080
because as adults we know that there's not always a prize.

17:06.080 --> 17:06.560
You know what I mean?

17:06.560 --> 17:08.960
Sometimes you just do it because you have to,

17:08.960 --> 17:10.320
because you're supposed to.

17:10.320 --> 17:12.400
And if you do it and expect a reward, right?

17:12.400 --> 17:13.680
Millennials, right?

17:13.680 --> 17:15.520
Expecting a reward every time.

17:15.520 --> 17:16.080
Sure.

17:16.080 --> 17:17.840
And you don't always get the trophy.

17:17.840 --> 17:19.760
Sometimes you just do it because you have to do it

17:19.760 --> 17:22.400
because you have to pay your stupid electricity bill

17:22.400 --> 17:23.440
because there's a lot of electricity

17:23.440 --> 17:25.120
you can't power your Nintendo Switch.

17:25.120 --> 17:28.320
And maybe the electricity bill is in the...

17:29.040 --> 17:31.280
It's got Family Guy in South Park on the box.

17:31.280 --> 17:33.920
And you know it's for adults.

17:33.920 --> 17:35.520
And so you crack it open

17:35.520 --> 17:38.800
and it's not that little joke burger that they serve to kids.

17:39.520 --> 17:40.480
It's, you know, a big...

17:40.480 --> 17:43.200
One of their weird fucked up artisanal burgers

17:43.200 --> 17:44.800
with like frizzled onions

17:44.800 --> 17:48.240
and that delicious McDonald's guacamole on it.

17:48.240 --> 17:49.920
But then you dig inside

17:49.920 --> 17:52.160
and maybe there's even a little bag, a little plastic bag

17:52.160 --> 17:53.360
and it feels like there's a toy in it

17:53.360 --> 17:56.240
and it does have, you know, Peter and Lois and everyone on it.

17:56.240 --> 17:56.960
And you tear it open

17:56.960 --> 17:59.360
and it is your electricity bill or your gas bill in there.

17:59.360 --> 18:02.080
Maybe there's a little plastic bag in there.

18:02.080 --> 18:05.040
You open it up and wait, it's your car keys?

18:05.040 --> 18:06.080
Didn't you just have the...

18:06.080 --> 18:07.360
You look up who just served you.

18:07.360 --> 18:08.480
It's Chris Angel.

18:08.480 --> 18:09.040
That's right.

18:09.040 --> 18:10.720
You've just been mind freaked.

18:10.720 --> 18:12.960
He's got your keys out of your pocket

18:12.960 --> 18:16.480
and somehow got them into the toy bag in the McDonald's.

18:16.480 --> 18:20.080
So we've basically covered the big three of adulthood.

18:21.040 --> 18:22.240
A reverent humor.

18:24.080 --> 18:25.760
Bill's Chris Angel.

18:25.760 --> 18:26.960
Chris Angel.

18:26.960 --> 18:27.840
I don't need...

18:27.840 --> 18:29.360
The good thing about the toy,

18:29.360 --> 18:30.480
the usual thing about the toy

18:30.480 --> 18:32.720
is it's a good way to convince your kids

18:32.720 --> 18:35.520
to eat their chicken grillers and apple slices.

18:35.520 --> 18:38.880
I don't need extra motivation to eat the McDonald's

18:38.880 --> 18:40.320
that I'm not allowed to eat.

18:40.320 --> 18:41.920
By the way, McDonald's if you're listening,

18:41.920 --> 18:44.560
some sort of bean-centric product would be

18:44.560 --> 18:46.960
a hugely appreciated to those of us.

18:46.960 --> 18:50.400
Meet Justin halfway here with some bean product.

18:50.400 --> 18:52.880
Justin, I feel like you're selling the toy short

18:52.880 --> 18:55.600
because it's also a good way to convince our dad

18:55.600 --> 18:58.640
in the 90s that they might be worth something someday.

18:58.640 --> 19:01.200
And so he needs to collect a shit ton of them

19:01.840 --> 19:04.880
and then eventually I assume throw them away.

19:04.880 --> 19:06.880
That, yeah, that already happened.

19:06.880 --> 19:07.840
Oh, okay.

19:07.840 --> 19:10.400
If you'll remember the drawer in the TV room

19:10.400 --> 19:13.040
when we destroyed the TV room.

19:13.040 --> 19:13.920
Oh, yeah.

19:13.920 --> 19:16.160
Yeah, that drawer existed.

19:16.160 --> 19:17.360
Yeah, that's a good point though.

19:17.360 --> 19:21.360
I don't have a bunch of room for a shitty little Cartman

19:22.160 --> 19:23.600
in my home now.

19:24.640 --> 19:26.720
And so maybe you crack open the box

19:26.720 --> 19:29.120
and it's got all my favorite adult characters on it

19:29.120 --> 19:30.800
and then I get the little plastic Cartman out of it

19:30.800 --> 19:31.920
and he just sort of sits there

19:31.920 --> 19:36.000
as some sort of weird lunch totem

19:36.000 --> 19:39.600
as I enjoy my bad burger and then somebody comes

19:39.600 --> 19:40.880
and they say, are you done, sir?

19:40.880 --> 19:44.000
And I say, yes, and then they throw this toy away for me.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.560
So I do not, I don't have to bring it into my house.

19:46.560 --> 19:49.120
What if the toy was made of Jordan almonds?

19:49.120 --> 19:51.040
Maybe just a nice palette cleanser.

19:51.040 --> 19:51.860
Now we're...

19:51.860 --> 19:55.760
The toy is just a Ferrero Rocher chocolate.

19:55.760 --> 19:57.760
Just a Ferrero Rocher.

19:57.760 --> 19:59.600
Has anyone ever eaten Jordan almonds

19:59.600 --> 20:02.160
that were not given to them as a wedding favor?

20:03.600 --> 20:04.400
Probably at some point.

20:04.400 --> 20:06.480
Think about it, really think about it.

20:06.480 --> 20:07.520
The answer is no.

20:07.520 --> 20:10.720
When's McDonald's gonna just start serving booze?

20:10.720 --> 20:11.840
You know what I mean?

20:11.840 --> 20:13.360
Come on, cowards.

20:14.320 --> 20:15.280
I want my booze.

20:16.320 --> 20:20.080
I want my fucking Eric Cartman toy

20:20.640 --> 20:22.320
to be thrown away for me

20:22.320 --> 20:25.200
and I want my guacamole burger with frizzled onions.

20:25.200 --> 20:28.000
This is, we can't get into this.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.920
I'm surprised we have not had a Munch Squad

20:29.920 --> 20:33.360
about McDonald's sort of Chipotle turn here

20:34.400 --> 20:35.680
here in the 11th hour.

20:35.680 --> 20:38.240
I just, it boggles the mind.

20:38.240 --> 20:40.400
Y'all want fancy shit from us, right?

20:40.400 --> 20:43.120
It's like they discovered the Necronomicon

20:43.120 --> 20:45.040
and it's like, you guys are dabbling in forces

20:45.040 --> 20:47.360
that I absolutely do not trust you with.

20:47.360 --> 20:48.640
Guacamole?

20:48.640 --> 20:50.080
That's not a McDonald's.

20:50.080 --> 20:52.000
That's not a McDonald's, unfortunately.

20:53.760 --> 20:55.200
This is not a Munch Squad,

20:55.200 --> 20:58.880
but I did wanna point out,

20:58.880 --> 21:00.400
I just Googled Ronald McDonald

21:00.400 --> 21:02.080
because I was like, where is that guy?

21:02.080 --> 21:04.160
Have you guys seen Ronald McDonald for a while?

21:04.160 --> 21:05.680
He hasn't, have you?

21:05.680 --> 21:06.880
It's been a minute, right?

21:06.880 --> 21:07.840
So here's the deal.

21:09.520 --> 21:11.440
In 2016, do you remember everybody

21:11.440 --> 21:14.080
was kinda tripped out about clowns for a minute?

21:15.280 --> 21:16.640
Did they pull him back a little bit?

21:17.520 --> 21:20.240
They're, quote, mindful of the current climate

21:20.240 --> 21:22.800
around clown signings in communities

21:22.800 --> 21:24.160
and being thoughtful in respect

21:24.160 --> 21:25.600
to Ronald McDonald's participation

21:25.600 --> 21:27.840
in community events for the time being.

21:27.840 --> 21:32.800
So your plan to make Ronald McDonald less terrifying

21:32.800 --> 21:34.320
is to put him in the hole?

21:34.320 --> 21:36.160
Hide him where we can't see him.

21:36.160 --> 21:38.240
Put him in solitary for a few years?

21:38.240 --> 21:40.560
We wanna be absolutely clear here.

21:41.200 --> 21:43.840
Ronald's still there and he's everywhere,

21:43.840 --> 21:45.280
but you won't see him anymore.

21:45.920 --> 21:48.960
So enjoy, enjoy this.

21:48.960 --> 21:50.960
Can I share something I just found

21:50.960 --> 21:53.280
on the Ronald McDonald Wikipedia?

21:53.280 --> 21:53.920
Yeah, please.

21:53.920 --> 21:55.280
Everybody always talks about the,

21:56.720 --> 21:58.800
oh, interesting fact, Willard Scott

21:58.800 --> 22:00.560
played the original Ronald McDonald.

22:00.560 --> 22:01.600
That's very, very interesting.

22:01.600 --> 22:06.000
Back to back, 1975 to 1984,

22:06.000 --> 22:07.840
and then 1984 to 1991,

22:08.720 --> 22:09.920
Ronald McDonald was portrayed

22:09.920 --> 22:12.000
by someone named King Moody.

22:12.720 --> 22:13.680
All right.

22:13.680 --> 22:16.080
Followed by Squire Fridell.

22:16.960 --> 22:17.680
Excellent.

22:17.680 --> 22:18.880
Are you shitting me?

22:18.880 --> 22:22.960
I assume Squire Fridell worked for King Moody

22:23.680 --> 22:25.120
as his squire.

22:25.120 --> 22:27.680
This had to be, this was back to back,

22:27.680 --> 22:29.840
King Moody followed by Squire Fridell.

22:29.840 --> 22:32.880
Yeah, followed by Paige Johnson.

22:32.880 --> 22:35.120
Right, like King Moody.

22:35.120 --> 22:39.200
King Moody was fucking Ronald McDonald for nine years.

22:39.920 --> 22:41.600
Yeah, and then they just took it away

22:41.600 --> 22:42.000
because he-

22:42.000 --> 22:43.760
They took his crown.

22:46.320 --> 22:47.360
How about another question?

22:48.240 --> 22:49.200
That sounds good to me.

22:52.320 --> 22:55.600
Man, King Moody was also a man from Uncle Bonanza,

22:55.600 --> 22:57.360
Bob Newhart Show, Chips,

22:57.360 --> 23:00.800
Dragnet, Dismart, as Ronald McDonald.

23:00.800 --> 23:02.400
There's a lot of product placement in those shows.

23:05.120 --> 23:06.240
Okay, so here we go.

23:07.440 --> 23:09.920
Okay, I just also wanted to let you know

23:09.920 --> 23:12.320
that Ronald McDonald, King Moody,

23:12.320 --> 23:15.040
Robert King Moody is his full name,

23:15.040 --> 23:18.800
is the dad of William Moody,

23:18.800 --> 23:20.560
better known as Paul Bearer.

23:20.560 --> 23:21.680
Are you shitting me?

23:21.680 --> 23:23.920
Get the shit out.

23:23.920 --> 23:26.080
Are you fucking with me right now with this?

23:26.080 --> 23:29.040
Star studded, star studded family.

23:29.040 --> 23:31.520
The other day I bought some gum from Starbucks.

23:32.080 --> 23:33.280
Once my coffee was gone,

23:33.280 --> 23:36.320
I realized that I had left the pack of gum

23:36.320 --> 23:38.160
back at Starbucks on the counter.

23:38.160 --> 23:39.200
I didn't have a receipt,

23:39.200 --> 23:40.640
and also it would be embarrassing

23:40.640 --> 23:42.080
to go back just for a pack of gum.

23:43.040 --> 23:44.480
I guess you didn't want gum that bad, huh?

23:45.120 --> 23:46.320
Do you think it's okay for me

23:46.320 --> 23:47.680
to just take one next time I'm there,

23:47.680 --> 23:49.200
or would that be considered stealing?

23:49.200 --> 23:51.520
And that's from Bad Breath because of forgotten gum.

23:51.520 --> 23:54.720
This is one of those rare and wonderful circumstances

23:54.720 --> 23:57.280
where stealing is better than the alternative.

23:58.080 --> 24:01.440
We're just taking a thing is better than the alternative,

24:01.440 --> 24:04.720
because the alternative is, hi,

24:05.680 --> 24:09.200
I bought this last time, but I didn't get it,

24:09.200 --> 24:11.040
so I'm gonna get it this time.

24:11.040 --> 24:14.720
And then, I feel like you'll be immediately arrested for that.

24:14.720 --> 24:17.840
If you steal and you get caught, you'll be arrested, right?

24:17.840 --> 24:20.480
If you steal and you get caught, you'll be arrested, right?

24:21.920 --> 24:23.360
Sort of Jean Valjean style,

24:23.360 --> 24:24.880
like I need this gum for my family.

24:24.880 --> 24:27.840
They breath, it stinks real bad.

24:27.840 --> 24:29.360
They love xylitol.

24:29.360 --> 24:34.480
Yeah, so I think you just gotta pocket this one.

24:34.480 --> 24:37.280
And I think it's fine, because you paid last time.

24:37.280 --> 24:40.400
And then if you get caught, you can explain the situation.

24:40.400 --> 24:41.920
Morally, it's fine.

24:41.920 --> 24:45.440
That will be a tough excuse to,

24:45.440 --> 24:47.680
you won't get caught, you can't get caught.

24:47.680 --> 24:48.880
Come on, really?

24:49.760 --> 24:51.520
If you get caught, you deserve whatever you get.

24:53.600 --> 24:54.720
It's an easy steal.

24:56.400 --> 24:58.400
We're not as hardcore into stealing

24:58.400 --> 25:00.800
as we were in earlier episodes.

25:00.800 --> 25:02.240
We're all parents now,

25:02.240 --> 25:06.080
and I don't think we can have the hard line on shoplifting,

25:06.080 --> 25:08.320
which is pro, that we had.

25:08.320 --> 25:11.840
Well, I got my bad bust,

25:11.840 --> 25:13.760
and so I'm out of the lifting game.

25:13.760 --> 25:14.960
Well, you got a bad bust?

25:14.960 --> 25:16.240
I didn't know this.

25:16.240 --> 25:17.760
Yeah, crate and barrel.

25:18.640 --> 25:19.680
Yeah.

25:19.680 --> 25:20.960
Crates or barrels?

25:20.960 --> 25:21.280
Both.

25:21.280 --> 25:23.440
I tried to shoplift a crate and a barrel at the same time.

25:23.440 --> 25:24.400
Yeah, it was bad.

25:25.360 --> 25:26.480
I tried to explain,

25:26.480 --> 25:27.600
because they got me out of the door,

25:27.600 --> 25:29.680
because I was carrying a big box made of wood,

25:29.680 --> 25:30.880
and a big barrel made of wood,

25:30.880 --> 25:31.840
and it was really heavy,

25:31.840 --> 25:33.520
and so I was struggling and making a lot of noise.

25:33.520 --> 25:34.880
A clamber, and I dropped the barrel,

25:35.440 --> 25:36.960
and that made a lot of noise.

25:36.960 --> 25:38.480
And then they got me at the door,

25:39.040 --> 25:39.600
and they were like,

25:41.360 --> 25:43.600
they said, actually, what the fuck do you think you're doing?

25:43.600 --> 25:44.800
Which I don't think you're allowed to cuss,

25:44.800 --> 25:47.600
and I did send a letter to the crate and barrel HQ,

25:47.600 --> 25:48.880
try and get that person removed,

25:48.880 --> 25:55.920
but I said I brought these here to get them serviced,

25:56.640 --> 25:59.520
because I thought this was a crate and a barrel repair shop,

26:00.400 --> 26:02.800
and I was turned away, and so I'm just taking them.

26:03.840 --> 26:05.280
And they said, oh, go right ahead,

26:05.280 --> 26:07.040
and then I walked out of the door,

26:07.040 --> 26:08.560
and the barrel exploded.

26:08.560 --> 26:10.640
It was full of C4, it was like a security measure,

26:10.640 --> 26:11.680
so the barrel exploded.

26:11.680 --> 26:14.560
And so that's how they got me.

26:16.320 --> 26:22.080
Could you steal your pack of gum back one piece at a time?

26:22.080 --> 26:23.120
Now I'm in.

26:23.120 --> 26:25.360
Now you have my curiosity,

26:25.360 --> 26:27.360
and now you have the rest of the quote from the movie.

26:28.080 --> 26:32.000
Could you just slip a piece out of a packet,

26:33.040 --> 26:35.440
and pop it in your mouth, and you get your gum?

26:35.440 --> 26:36.800
And you didn't take a whole pack.

26:36.800 --> 26:40.720
That's not even stealing, if you think about it.

26:40.720 --> 26:42.000
One piece of gum.

26:42.000 --> 26:42.880
Here's the thing, Justin,

26:42.880 --> 26:45.040
you're gonna need a Rita Hayworth poster

26:45.040 --> 26:46.800
to cover up the gum.

26:46.800 --> 26:47.840
Yourself, your body.

26:47.840 --> 26:50.960
To cover up your body and the gum,

26:50.960 --> 26:52.800
and like a tiny gum pickaxe.

26:53.440 --> 26:54.480
At Comic Con this year,

26:54.480 --> 26:56.640
I'm cosplaying as a Rita Hayworth poster.

26:56.640 --> 26:59.520
I wear it, and then during one of the live shows,

26:59.520 --> 27:01.600
you'll be like, Griffin's been quiet for a while,

27:01.600 --> 27:02.560
and then you move the poster,

27:02.560 --> 27:04.400
and I will have slipped out from behind the chair.

27:04.400 --> 27:06.880
And Griffin's just swimming through two miles of shit.

27:08.080 --> 27:10.560
Last time I went to Starbucks, I did the drive-through,

27:10.560 --> 27:13.040
and on the, it was like a little metal shelf

27:13.040 --> 27:14.960
for you to put your card on and stuff.

27:14.960 --> 27:17.840
Outside the drive-through window, on the metal shelf,

27:17.840 --> 27:20.880
there was a basket that had in it stuff like gum,

27:20.880 --> 27:23.200
and the Rice Krispie Treats, and maybe a nice biscotti.

27:23.760 --> 27:27.120
Would you assume that those were complimentary?

27:27.120 --> 27:28.960
They were on a shelf outside.

27:30.000 --> 27:31.600
They're not cooling a pie out there.

27:32.160 --> 27:34.160
I assumed they were complimentary.

27:34.160 --> 27:37.440
Yeah, like when bookstores put the books outside

27:37.440 --> 27:38.240
of the front door.

27:38.240 --> 27:40.480
The ones they want you to steal, right, exactly.

27:40.480 --> 27:45.120
I thought that was for stealing, and like I didn't try it,

27:45.120 --> 27:48.480
but they confirmed for me that those were purchasable goods.

27:48.480 --> 27:52.240
They're just trying to establish another point of sale there.

27:52.240 --> 27:54.080
They're trying to establish a fucking bait car,

27:54.080 --> 27:54.560
is what they're doing.

27:54.560 --> 27:55.360
It's what it is, right?

27:55.360 --> 27:58.080
Like Starbucks maybe has their head

27:58.080 --> 27:59.760
on a pretty major swivel for theft.

27:59.760 --> 28:01.360
I guess is what I'm saying,

28:01.360 --> 28:03.200
is that's what gets him up in the morning,

28:03.200 --> 28:05.600
is busting innocent people for stealing.

28:07.360 --> 28:09.120
You could pretend you thought they were complimentary

28:09.120 --> 28:10.000
if you get caught.

28:10.000 --> 28:11.360
Oh God, that's so good.

28:11.360 --> 28:12.720
You guys sell coffee.

28:12.720 --> 28:15.600
I just thought this was part of the deal.

28:15.600 --> 28:17.280
Oh, is this not for everyone?

28:18.400 --> 28:19.680
So you just took a banana.

28:19.680 --> 28:22.400
Well, yeah, you're fucking Starbucks.

28:22.400 --> 28:23.760
Why do you have produce?

28:23.760 --> 28:26.080
You tried to make $7 for a coffee.

28:27.440 --> 28:29.440
And now we can now let's get into it,

28:29.440 --> 28:31.120
because why are they charging so much

28:31.120 --> 28:34.160
for this dang coffee at Starbucks?

28:34.160 --> 28:36.160
It's a rich frame we've unearthed.

28:36.160 --> 28:39.200
I can't believe we're the first ones to finally make it

28:39.200 --> 28:41.920
to go through about how much Starbucks costs.

28:41.920 --> 28:43.840
And what's the deal with their Christmas cups?

28:45.040 --> 28:46.320
Yeah, go for it, Trav.

28:46.880 --> 28:48.560
Not in my backyard.

28:49.360 --> 28:51.920
Don't crack open the door to your skewed perspective

28:51.920 --> 28:53.920
and then not throw that bad boy open

28:53.920 --> 28:55.120
and let me look inside.

28:56.160 --> 28:58.960
I might've used the wrong tone of voice

28:58.960 --> 29:00.240
because I honestly was asking,

29:00.240 --> 29:01.520
what is the deal with it?

29:01.520 --> 29:04.880
I see people talking about it and I thought button issue.

29:04.880 --> 29:06.080
What is it?

29:06.640 --> 29:08.000
Yeah, if you go in there right now,

29:08.000 --> 29:09.200
you can't find a single one.

29:09.200 --> 29:09.920
Okay, cowards.

29:09.920 --> 29:11.920
Yeah, war on Christmas, am I right?

29:11.920 --> 29:13.440
The war on Christmas in July.

29:15.840 --> 29:17.520
They're not satisfied by their one war.

29:17.520 --> 29:19.760
They won a war on two fronts in two months.

29:19.760 --> 29:21.120
What about summer Jesus?

29:21.120 --> 29:21.600
You know what I mean?

29:21.600 --> 29:23.360
When was summer Jesus born?

29:23.360 --> 29:26.160
Do you think there would be a bigger conflict this Christmas

29:26.160 --> 29:27.360
if their cups had said,

29:27.360 --> 29:28.960
we fucking love Jesus,

29:28.960 --> 29:32.240
the one true Lord and savior who came to earth

29:32.240 --> 29:34.080
as a baby of virgin birth.

29:34.080 --> 29:35.520
We're fucking crazy about him.

29:35.520 --> 29:37.760
And if you don't believe him, you're gonna go to hell.

29:37.760 --> 29:39.840
Check the cup, fuckers.

29:39.840 --> 29:43.120
Where you saw the one pair of footprints on the beach.

29:43.120 --> 29:44.240
That was summer Jesus.

29:44.240 --> 29:46.080
That's where he hangs out.

29:46.080 --> 29:49.120
He's always there getting beautiful tan,

29:49.120 --> 29:50.960
learning how to boogie board to folks who need it.

29:52.400 --> 29:53.280
Such a chill guy.

29:54.240 --> 29:55.280
Should we go to the money zone

29:55.280 --> 29:57.440
so we don't have to keep fucking stealing gum from Starbucks

29:57.440 --> 29:59.920
and then maybe Travis will stop complaining about the prices?

29:59.920 --> 30:11.760
Let's do it.

30:11.760 --> 30:13.680
I would like to tell you about Squarespace.

30:14.640 --> 30:19.840
Squarespace is an incredibly intuitive website design platform

30:19.840 --> 30:22.560
that you don't need any special knowledge to use.

30:22.560 --> 30:24.880
You don't need any kind of special training.

30:24.880 --> 30:26.160
You can start today.

30:26.960 --> 30:28.800
And I get like, this is not a joke,

30:28.800 --> 30:30.640
no exaggeration, within the hour

30:31.200 --> 30:33.360
you could have a website up and running.

30:33.360 --> 30:35.360
I've done a bunch of websites on it already.

30:36.160 --> 30:38.880
I actually just built one for a project

30:38.880 --> 30:40.560
that me and some friends are working on here.

30:40.560 --> 30:42.560
Took me like 45 minutes.

30:42.560 --> 30:47.120
And it's not just your basic GeoCities kind of shit

30:47.120 --> 30:50.160
with dancing hamsters and under construction signs.

30:50.160 --> 30:52.480
This is like a sleek professional website

30:52.480 --> 30:56.640
that you can plug in merchandise

30:56.640 --> 31:02.000
and links to shit and buttons and pictures and slideshows

31:02.000 --> 31:05.360
and email and your own domain.

31:05.360 --> 31:06.320
All of these things.

31:06.320 --> 31:07.360
It's incredible.

31:07.360 --> 31:08.640
If you want to see an example of this,

31:08.640 --> 31:12.640
you can go to mcroyshows.com that we built on Squarespace.

31:15.040 --> 31:17.040
I made griffomcroy.com

31:17.040 --> 31:18.800
and I really liked how easy it was to use

31:18.800 --> 31:21.840
and I set up a contact page that I did recently have to,

31:21.840 --> 31:24.640
it's on timeout because I did start to get

31:24.640 --> 31:26.320
basically daily emails.

31:26.320 --> 31:28.240
I don't know if this is a coordinated attack

31:28.240 --> 31:31.920
from people who just wanted to talk about VOR

31:31.920 --> 31:32.880
and not so much talk about,

31:32.880 --> 31:35.360
but just sort of like yell at me about,

31:35.360 --> 31:38.240
just sort of yell it, yell the subject at me.

31:38.240 --> 31:39.280
So that one is on timeout,

31:39.280 --> 31:41.280
but they do let you put up a contact page

31:41.280 --> 31:43.040
that will get VOR spammed.

31:43.040 --> 31:46.080
And Squarespace provides award-winning 24-7 support.

31:46.800 --> 31:48.800
They have a unique domain experience.

31:48.800 --> 31:50.800
It's fully transparent and easy to set up

31:50.800 --> 31:53.280
and you can do a free trial right now

31:53.280 --> 31:55.600

31:55.600 --> 31:59.520

31:59.520 --> 32:02.240
That's squarespace.com slash my brother.

32:02.960 --> 32:04.080
I want to tell you all about Blue Apron

32:04.080 --> 32:05.280
because I fucking love Blue Apron.

32:05.280 --> 32:07.280
We've been using it for a little over a year now

32:07.280 --> 32:08.320
and I learned how to cook.

32:08.320 --> 32:10.240
I didn't know how to cook and I had Blue Apron

32:10.240 --> 32:12.320
and now I know how to cook and I love cooking.

32:13.120 --> 32:16.960
They send you for less than 10 bucks per person per meal,

32:16.960 --> 32:18.720
they'll send you seasonal recipes

32:18.720 --> 32:20.320
along with pre-portioned ingredients

32:20.320 --> 32:22.080
that you can use to make delicious home-cooked meals.

32:22.080 --> 32:23.360
I'm talking about stuff like seared chicken

32:23.360 --> 32:26.160
and creamy pasta salad with summer squash and sweet peppers,

32:26.160 --> 32:27.760
creamy shrimp rolls with quick pickles

32:27.760 --> 32:30.800
and sweet potato wedges, fresh basil fettuccine pasta

32:30.800 --> 32:32.400
with sweet corn and cubanelle pepper,

32:33.040 --> 32:34.480
all kinds of amazing meals.

32:34.480 --> 32:37.920
I seriously love this thing and you will too.

32:37.920 --> 32:39.360
If you check out this week's menu

32:39.360 --> 32:41.760
and get your first three meals for free with free shipping,

32:41.760 --> 32:44.160
just go to blueapron.com slash my brother.

32:44.160 --> 32:47.120
One more time, that's blueapron.com slash my brother.

32:48.480 --> 32:50.640
We got some Jumbotron messages here

32:50.640 --> 32:52.400
I'd love to share with y'all.

32:52.400 --> 32:55.600
The first is from one of the guys

32:55.600 --> 32:57.920
who brought you the True Tiles Kickstarter

32:57.920 --> 33:06.240
comes heroeshored.com, that's H-E-R-O-S-H-O-A-R-D.com.

33:07.280 --> 33:10.240
Head to Heroes Horde to buy beautifully rendered 3D tiles,

33:10.240 --> 33:13.360
terrain and scenery for your tabletop or role-playing game.

33:13.360 --> 33:15.200
Built by a lifelong D&D player,

33:15.200 --> 33:17.840
these files let you pair old school gaming

33:17.840 --> 33:19.120
with new school tech.

33:19.120 --> 33:21.680
Buy and print the files you need

33:21.680 --> 33:22.800
I bet it's supposed to be tiles.

33:22.800 --> 33:24.320
I think it's probably supposed to be tiles.

33:24.320 --> 33:25.440
What did I say?

33:25.440 --> 33:26.080
Files.

33:26.080 --> 33:27.920
It does say files in the copy,

33:27.920 --> 33:30.240
but I think it's supposed to be tiles.

33:30.240 --> 33:32.560
Well, you could understand my confusion.

33:32.560 --> 33:33.120
But buy and print-

33:33.120 --> 33:35.200
No, Justin, it says files.

33:35.200 --> 33:36.240
Don't get me wrong.

33:36.240 --> 33:37.840
I'm not correcting you.

33:37.840 --> 33:39.280
I'm correcting the copy.

33:39.280 --> 33:40.320
I think it's tiles.

33:40.960 --> 33:42.960
Buy and print the tiles or files,

33:42.960 --> 33:44.080
whatever you want.

33:44.080 --> 33:45.760
You can arrange them any way you like

33:45.760 --> 33:48.640
to astound and confound your players.

33:48.640 --> 33:52.720
Build the layout of your dreams with HeroesHorde.com

33:52.720 --> 33:53.760
Can you spell it one more time?

33:53.760 --> 33:56.480
Because both of those words could be spelled different.

33:56.480 --> 34:01.040
H-E-R-O-S-H-O-A-R-D.com

34:01.680 --> 34:02.480
That was beautiful.

34:02.480 --> 34:03.440
That jingle was free.

34:03.440 --> 34:05.760
Don't don't add us about jingles anymore.

34:05.760 --> 34:06.400
Jingles are back.

34:07.280 --> 34:08.880
Here's another personal message.

34:08.880 --> 34:10.640
This one's for Cory Daniels.

34:10.640 --> 34:12.560
And it's from Jacob Rich, who says

34:13.200 --> 34:15.600
Readin' Garfield at the Elvis Warlock voice file.

34:15.600 --> 34:17.280
We're not dancin' monkeys.

34:17.280 --> 34:19.760
Are we going to fuck or what?

34:19.760 --> 34:20.800
Griffin is.

34:20.800 --> 34:21.360
Griffin is.

34:21.360 --> 34:22.960
I'm really glad Griffin used the voice

34:22.960 --> 34:24.960
because if he hadn't that would have been just upsetting

34:24.960 --> 34:27.440
to just hear out of Griffin in like a flat voice.

34:27.440 --> 34:29.120
Yeah, let me give you an alternate take.

34:30.960 --> 34:31.840
I think the first take was good

34:31.840 --> 34:33.120
and I think that's the one we're gonna go with.

34:33.120 --> 34:34.880
But are we gonna fuck or what?

34:35.680 --> 34:37.760
Thanks for being an awesome friend and mentor

34:37.760 --> 34:38.880
and getting me a job.

34:38.880 --> 34:40.400
Love, your buddy Jacob.

34:40.400 --> 34:42.480
Or perhaps love your buddy Jacob.

34:43.520 --> 34:43.920
Love him.

34:44.640 --> 34:45.840
Love him, damn it.

34:45.840 --> 34:46.960
We have one more Jumbotron.

34:46.960 --> 34:48.000
This is for Kristen.

34:48.000 --> 34:49.440
This is from Steve.

34:50.080 --> 34:53.360
Happy New Year or Post-Valentine's Day day

34:53.360 --> 34:57.520
or World Rat Day or Canada Day or Birthday

34:57.520 --> 34:59.120
or Thanksgiving or Candle Nights

34:59.120 --> 35:00.800
depending on when the McElroys read this.

35:00.800 --> 35:01.760
Love you bunches.

35:02.560 --> 35:06.400
I love that 94% of this message was spent dragging us

35:06.400 --> 35:08.000
for how bad we are.

35:08.000 --> 35:09.920
Not a good use of your hundred dollars.

35:09.920 --> 35:11.200
I think it's a pretty good use

35:11.200 --> 35:14.080
because I feel very small right now

35:14.080 --> 35:19.360
and you did that.

35:19.360 --> 35:21.600
Following the news is hard and it sucks.

35:21.600 --> 35:23.600
How do you know which stories are important?

35:23.600 --> 35:25.040
Which sources do you trust

35:25.040 --> 35:28.000
in this post-truth world of reactionary journalism?

35:28.000 --> 35:28.880
I'm Brent Black

35:28.880 --> 35:30.240
and I'm Travis McElroy

35:30.240 --> 35:32.640
and we host a podcast called Trends Like These.

35:32.640 --> 35:34.400
We cover trending news stories.

35:34.400 --> 35:36.880
We debunk misleading clickbait headlines

35:36.880 --> 35:39.760
and we always try to throw in a little bit of good news

35:39.760 --> 35:41.360
in our quest for truth.

35:41.360 --> 35:44.640
So join us every week on MaximumFun.org

35:44.640 --> 35:46.400
or wherever podcasts are found.

35:48.720 --> 35:50.160
I mean, here's one.

35:50.160 --> 35:50.880
Here's a Yahoo!

35:50.880 --> 35:52.240
And this one is sent in by Kevin Budnick.

35:52.240 --> 35:52.880
Thank you, Kevin.

35:52.880 --> 35:55.040
It's Yahoo Answers user David who asks,

35:56.400 --> 36:01.120
when was it proven that you can't breathe in space?

36:02.480 --> 36:03.520
No additional details.

36:04.160 --> 36:04.660
Huh.

36:05.440 --> 36:07.200
I like this idea.

36:07.200 --> 36:11.280
Buzz and Lance hop off the spaceship,

36:12.160 --> 36:13.600
step on that man.

36:13.600 --> 36:16.080
And Buzz just like immediately is like,

36:17.040 --> 36:18.640
crack and like takes off the helmet

36:18.640 --> 36:19.920
and he's like, all right, let's look.

36:20.480 --> 36:21.120
Oh, no.

36:23.520 --> 36:24.560
Oh shoot.

36:24.560 --> 36:26.400
Hey, he puts it back on real quick.

36:26.400 --> 36:28.560
He's like, Lance, don't, it's weird.

36:31.600 --> 36:33.440
You know how normally you can?

36:33.440 --> 36:34.320
Well, you can't.

36:34.320 --> 36:35.440
I couldn't.

36:35.440 --> 36:37.600
I put, I popped it off because,

36:37.600 --> 36:38.560
and this is going to be,

36:38.560 --> 36:40.480
I just realized how uncomfortable

36:40.480 --> 36:42.240
this is going to be the whole time, Lance.

36:42.240 --> 36:45.360
Griffin, are you saying Lance Armstrong?

36:45.360 --> 36:46.320
I am, aren't I?

36:50.560 --> 36:51.840
That's not him.

36:51.840 --> 36:53.520
That's not it at all, it's Neil.

36:54.240 --> 36:56.560
It was Neil who did it.

36:56.560 --> 36:58.400
But Lance Armstrong did say he did.

37:00.560 --> 37:01.360
Oh, me?

37:01.360 --> 37:02.320
Fo sho.

37:02.320 --> 37:04.160
I got up there, loved it.

37:04.160 --> 37:05.200
Crazy about it.

37:05.200 --> 37:06.320
Took my helmet off.

37:06.320 --> 37:07.280
I was fine.

37:07.280 --> 37:08.000
I was fine.

37:08.000 --> 37:10.480
I don't know why all these other guys can't.

37:11.120 --> 37:12.240
And that's how they got him.

37:12.240 --> 37:13.280
I biked up to the moon.

37:13.280 --> 37:14.720
People were like, yeah, yep, yep, yep.

37:14.720 --> 37:15.600
Makes sense, makes sense.

37:15.600 --> 37:18.320
He's like, got up there, popped off my stupid helmet

37:18.320 --> 37:21.200
because I wanted to really relax and unwind up there

37:21.200 --> 37:22.960
and have just like a lunar chill sesh.

37:23.520 --> 37:25.920
And then I breathed just normal.

37:25.920 --> 37:27.840
And they're like, wait a minute, Lance.

37:27.840 --> 37:29.120
Jacuzzi.

37:29.120 --> 37:31.360
Jacuzzi, I can't believe I fucked that up.

37:31.920 --> 37:34.080
You did prove it though because everybody,

37:34.080 --> 37:35.920
this is a fun fiction that I've just spun.

37:35.920 --> 37:39.760
And it's also a fun fiction to say that Neil Armstrong did it.

37:40.400 --> 37:44.320
But my question for all these space types

37:44.320 --> 37:47.440
who've got their head in the clouds is,

37:48.080 --> 37:49.520
has anybody ever really tried it?

37:52.080 --> 37:53.760
Has anybody ever really tried it?

37:53.760 --> 37:55.280
And how do we know that it didn't?

37:57.440 --> 38:00.400
Yeah, maybe this is like a flat Earth situation.

38:00.400 --> 38:02.880
Well, no, God, please, God, don't equate it to that.

38:02.880 --> 38:03.680
Please don't put that on me.

38:03.680 --> 38:05.280
Where everyone's just like, the Earth is flat.

38:05.280 --> 38:06.160
The Earth is flat.

38:06.160 --> 38:07.680
But until you test it is what I mean.

38:07.680 --> 38:09.200
Oh, I see, I see, I see.

38:09.200 --> 38:10.960
Because we just assumed, we just assumed.

38:10.960 --> 38:12.640
We looked up at space and we said,

38:12.640 --> 38:14.160
that seems hard to breathe in.

38:14.160 --> 38:15.920
And we all nodded at each other.

38:15.920 --> 38:16.880
And that was it.

38:16.880 --> 38:17.920
That's as far as we went.

38:18.640 --> 38:20.640
You're like, who's ever stood in a vacuum?

38:20.640 --> 38:21.680
Because here's the thing.

38:21.680 --> 38:23.760
Maybe you got in a vacuum for a second and you're like,

38:23.760 --> 38:24.400
hard to breathe.

38:24.400 --> 38:27.040
But what you didn't count on was rapid evolution.

38:28.400 --> 38:30.560
Like when you pick up a fish and you throw it on land

38:30.560 --> 38:33.280
and suddenly starts walking around because it has to.

38:33.280 --> 38:34.400
It's got to.

38:34.400 --> 38:36.560
And that's what survival of the fittest is.

38:36.560 --> 38:38.960
Is like, you either fit or you don't.

38:38.960 --> 38:39.600
You know what I mean?

38:39.600 --> 38:40.720
Like you gotta get fit.

38:41.280 --> 38:44.480
Like Slim Goodbody's head.

38:44.480 --> 38:46.080
You gotta get fit or die.

38:46.080 --> 38:48.720
During all of his talks about evolution.

38:48.720 --> 38:50.000
Yeah, rapid evolution, please.

38:50.000 --> 38:52.160
Rapid evolution, X-Men style evolution.

38:52.160 --> 38:58.320
I wanna get Elon on the horn and just say,

38:58.320 --> 39:01.760
send me up, crack my visor for a minute

39:01.760 --> 39:05.760
and see because there's a lot of scientific method

39:05.760 --> 39:10.960
says you generate a theory and then there's a control group

39:11.520 --> 39:13.680
and that can be one of y'all.

39:13.680 --> 39:15.040
And you can keep your fucking helmet on

39:15.040 --> 39:16.400
because I guess you don't like to live on the edge.

39:16.400 --> 39:18.720
And also we're trying to prove a scientific hypothesis.

39:18.720 --> 39:21.280
And then I'll crack it for a second.

39:21.840 --> 39:24.480
Try to get a few good deep lungfuls.

39:25.200 --> 39:26.560
And maybe it happens, maybe it doesn't.

39:26.560 --> 39:28.160
I'm just saying if we could all breathe up there,

39:28.160 --> 39:30.080
I think we'd be up there already.

39:30.080 --> 39:31.760
Well, I mean, look at this way.

39:31.760 --> 39:34.400
Like I can't breathe underwater, but fish can.

39:34.960 --> 39:35.680
You know what I mean?

39:35.680 --> 39:40.080
So like the idea of like the way I breathe

39:40.080 --> 39:42.080
is the way everything breathes.

39:42.080 --> 39:44.560
Stinks, it's a shitty way of thinking.

39:44.560 --> 39:45.120
Yeah, right?

39:45.120 --> 39:47.600
Like I'm not going to limit,

39:47.600 --> 39:49.920
I'm not gonna be that oxygen focused.

39:50.800 --> 39:52.880
I'm gonna say that maybe there's other ways

39:52.880 --> 39:54.080
of breathing out there.

39:54.080 --> 39:58.000
And like maybe the way I breathe is right for me,

39:58.000 --> 40:01.360
but it might not be right for some, you know?

40:01.360 --> 40:03.840
I say make a plan and God laughs.

40:03.840 --> 40:06.000
Maybe you're planning that you will be able to,

40:06.000 --> 40:06.800
maybe you won't.

40:06.800 --> 40:10.080
Maybe you should just go to space and see how it goes.

40:10.080 --> 40:12.960
When God closes the door, he opens a window

40:12.960 --> 40:17.360
and you are sucked out into that infinite inky vacuum.

40:17.360 --> 40:20.160
It's like my tattoo says, just breathe, you know?

40:20.160 --> 40:20.400
Just.

40:21.440 --> 40:24.880
Peculiar travel suggestions are dancing lessons from God.

40:24.880 --> 40:30.240
And so if I say to you, go up to space, check it out.

40:30.880 --> 40:31.920
You might like it.

40:31.920 --> 40:34.720
That's basically God speaking through me,

40:36.160 --> 40:42.800
via Kurt Vonnegut into you, vis-a-vis dancing lessons.

40:42.800 --> 40:43.200
Yeah.

40:43.200 --> 40:44.560
From God through me.

40:44.560 --> 40:45.840
So maybe you should just go up there

40:45.840 --> 40:47.920
and fucking see how it goes, you know?

40:47.920 --> 40:50.560
Yeah, explore like my other tattoo says.

40:52.080 --> 40:54.160
Travis has got a lot of words on him.

40:54.160 --> 40:55.520
I've got memento disease.

40:56.320 --> 40:58.480
You know, the Lord works in mysterious ways

40:58.480 --> 41:00.160
but most of the time through Justin.

41:01.840 --> 41:02.560
How about another question?

41:02.560 --> 41:04.400
Justin is God being manifest on earth.

41:04.400 --> 41:05.680
It's weird about that.

41:05.680 --> 41:07.760
It's weird but it's true and real.

41:07.760 --> 41:10.160
I have just started regularly going to the gym

41:10.160 --> 41:11.040
and I have a problem.

41:11.840 --> 41:13.760
I don't really know when to leave.

41:14.320 --> 41:15.840
Once I've done a bit of biking

41:15.840 --> 41:17.760
and push some heavy things up and down,

41:17.760 --> 41:20.640
I inevitably end up looking like a lost scared child

41:20.640 --> 41:22.800
who doesn't know whether to stay and lift more

41:22.800 --> 41:24.240
or just walk out.

41:24.240 --> 41:27.840
I feel the buff eyes of my peers judging my indecision.

41:27.840 --> 41:30.640
How can I know when it's time to pack my gym bag

41:30.640 --> 41:31.280
and run away?

41:31.280 --> 41:33.920
And that's from Indecisive in LA.

41:33.920 --> 41:37.360
And I have a pretty easy answer for this one.

41:38.240 --> 41:41.760
If you can lift more, you must.

41:43.120 --> 41:46.000
When you're at the gym, you have to leave.

41:46.000 --> 41:46.800
Take it from me.

41:47.440 --> 41:48.720
When you're at the gym,

41:48.720 --> 41:51.120
you have to leave it all on the tarp.

41:51.120 --> 41:58.880
That they presumably spread out for the sweat.

41:58.880 --> 42:00.160
Oh, they got to, right?

42:00.160 --> 42:01.200
I've never been to one,

42:01.200 --> 42:03.520
but please tell me there's a tarp.

42:05.120 --> 42:06.720
Sometimes it's just old newspaper.

42:08.560 --> 42:11.680
What else do they do with all their humors

42:11.680 --> 42:15.440
that fall out during exertion?

42:15.440 --> 42:18.080
Oh man, I hope there's a tarp.

42:18.880 --> 42:20.640
I hear a lot about leg day.

42:20.640 --> 42:22.160
So is it leg day?

42:22.800 --> 42:25.280
Did you do that?

42:25.280 --> 42:27.440
Then you should be okay.

42:27.440 --> 42:31.360
If you didn't do it for leg day,

42:32.480 --> 42:35.680
get back in there and leg day.

42:36.240 --> 42:39.680
Like, do you even lift like my other tattoo says?

42:40.400 --> 42:42.000
Jesus, Trev, you got to stop with these.

42:42.000 --> 42:42.880
You got to stop getting these.

42:42.880 --> 42:45.920
And I know I tried to talk you out of that 60 point, Pika,

42:46.800 --> 42:48.960
but you just had to go for it.

42:48.960 --> 42:51.760
Right across my butt cheeks.

42:52.640 --> 42:53.760
What you're suggesting, Justin,

42:53.760 --> 42:56.880
is that you just go until you're a stain on the bench.

42:57.600 --> 42:58.640
Well, that's what I think, Griffin.

42:58.640 --> 43:01.120
A true gym rat will tell you that you have to stay in the gym

43:01.120 --> 43:03.360
until you're asked to leave by the gym staff.

43:03.360 --> 43:05.600
Not because you're being disruptive or a problem,

43:05.600 --> 43:07.280
but because they're worried about you.

43:08.080 --> 43:10.240
It's like, hey, you've been here for three days.

43:10.240 --> 43:12.560
You need to go home, see your family.

43:13.200 --> 43:15.280
Maybe you can loudly announce as you're leaving,

43:15.280 --> 43:16.960
like, they're out of weights.

43:16.960 --> 43:18.560
I used them all up.

43:18.560 --> 43:19.680
Bye, everybody.

43:19.680 --> 43:22.720
I lifted them and lifted them directly into my mouth.

43:22.720 --> 43:23.920
I gained their strength.

43:24.480 --> 43:26.720
That's 20 more pounds of punching power.

43:26.720 --> 43:28.400
This is what you do.

43:29.840 --> 43:31.520
This is the thing that people do sometimes

43:31.520 --> 43:32.880
where they're like lifting and they're grunting

43:32.880 --> 43:34.960
and then they just like drop the weights on the ground.

43:34.960 --> 43:37.040
And this is very disruptive because it's like,

43:37.760 --> 43:40.080
there are people usually a floor underneath you

43:40.080 --> 43:43.120
just trying to run on the treadmill and watch Judge Judy

43:43.120 --> 43:44.720
and like you drop the weights

43:44.720 --> 43:46.880
and make them feel like the world is collapsing.

43:46.880 --> 43:47.840
It's not good.

43:47.840 --> 43:50.240
So instead, gently set the weights down

43:50.240 --> 43:51.920
and then just stand up straight,

43:51.920 --> 43:54.960
look surprised like you just realized this fact

43:54.960 --> 43:58.800
and yell, I'm done and walk out the front door.

43:58.800 --> 43:59.840
That's pretty good.

43:59.840 --> 44:02.800
You should probably also loudly announce an excuse

44:02.800 --> 44:04.720
that will placate everyone in the gym

44:04.720 --> 44:06.080
that is monitoring your movements.

44:06.080 --> 44:07.440
So as you're leaving,

44:07.440 --> 44:08.800
you scoop your bag over your shoulder,

44:08.800 --> 44:11.760
say, hey guys, sorry, my Nana needs a ride.

44:11.760 --> 44:13.440
And then like put on your sunglasses

44:13.440 --> 44:15.120
and look over your other shoulder and be like,

44:15.120 --> 44:17.440
Nana problems, you wouldn't understand.

44:17.440 --> 44:18.640
And then go out the door.

44:18.640 --> 44:20.080
You put on your sunglasses,

44:20.080 --> 44:21.440
then you put on your Nana

44:21.440 --> 44:24.480
after you put on your sunglasses, runner home Yoda style.

44:24.480 --> 44:27.040
And that's also gonna get you sick gains.

44:27.040 --> 44:28.400
That's gonna get you sick Nana gains.

44:28.400 --> 44:29.040
And that's important.

44:29.040 --> 44:30.480
You gotta get them everywhere you can.

44:32.400 --> 44:34.880
What's the gym, I think it's Planet Fitness

44:34.880 --> 44:39.200
where if you do grunt and drop the weights,

44:39.200 --> 44:40.720
they actually like kick you out

44:40.720 --> 44:45.760
cause they try to create like a jerk free environment.

44:45.760 --> 44:47.600
I think it's Planet Hollywood.

44:48.240 --> 44:49.280
I think it's Planet Hollywood.

44:49.280 --> 44:50.240
You go and you crash,

44:50.240 --> 44:52.960
you destroy some Schwarzenegger onion rings

44:52.960 --> 44:54.240
and then you start pumping.

44:55.040 --> 44:56.160
No, I think it's Planet Fitness

44:56.160 --> 44:59.680
and that makes me never wanna go into a Planet Fitness

45:00.320 --> 45:03.040
because I imagine if I go

45:03.040 --> 45:06.640
and I do try to lift one of those big wonderful bars,

45:07.360 --> 45:09.840
there would be a considerable amount of grunting

45:09.840 --> 45:13.040
and probably some dropping involved.

45:13.040 --> 45:16.720
And then the whole exercise will be cut off

45:16.720 --> 45:19.440
before it really gets going.

45:19.440 --> 45:21.680
Don't worry about it.

45:21.680 --> 45:22.960
They have a chart that's like,

45:22.960 --> 45:25.120
is the grunt like, oh, I did it.

45:25.120 --> 45:28.400
Or is it like, oh, you fall down.

45:28.400 --> 45:30.000
And if it's that second one,

45:30.000 --> 45:32.240
you're good unless you've been injured

45:33.120 --> 45:36.400
and then they will have several burly people carry you out.

45:37.040 --> 45:39.040
I just imagine there's a lot of people doing

45:40.080 --> 45:42.000
spinning and yoga laddies and stuff like that.

45:42.000 --> 45:46.080
How I would, it would be very distracting for them.

45:46.720 --> 45:50.080
The sort of sounds and visuals

45:50.080 --> 45:54.160
that I would produce with one of those big wonderful bars.

45:54.720 --> 45:55.520
Just a lot of like.

45:59.520 --> 46:01.520
This is an interesting fact that I learned.

46:01.520 --> 46:04.800
I read it on, today I learned on Reddit.

46:04.800 --> 46:06.960
No one's ever died in a Planet Fitness

46:06.960 --> 46:08.160
because if you start to die,

46:08.160 --> 46:10.880
they just carry you outside past the parking lot

46:10.880 --> 46:12.240
and set you down.

46:12.240 --> 46:13.360
Oh.

46:13.360 --> 46:16.000
Yeah, so like in all the.

46:16.000 --> 46:17.600
Wait, no, I'm thinking of Disney.

46:18.160 --> 46:19.920
Sorry, sorry, run that back.

46:20.640 --> 46:21.200
I mean, for me,

46:21.200 --> 46:22.960
the gym is the most wonderful place on earth.

46:22.960 --> 46:23.460
So.

46:24.240 --> 46:25.600
I call it my magic kingdom.

46:27.760 --> 46:28.720
Well, thank God.

46:29.680 --> 46:30.180
What?

46:31.760 --> 46:33.120
Huh? Horses.

46:33.120 --> 46:34.560
I want to munch.

46:34.560 --> 46:35.060
Squad.

46:37.440 --> 46:39.680
I want to munch.

46:39.680 --> 46:43.680
Squad.

46:43.680 --> 46:46.720
Thank you to Jack for submitting this one.

46:47.440 --> 46:49.200
This is big news, limited time.

46:49.920 --> 46:51.600
Gotta get in there and get it.

46:52.400 --> 46:55.040
Canada's birthday, 150th.

46:55.840 --> 46:57.600
You're going to eat Canada?

46:57.600 --> 46:58.320
No.

46:58.320 --> 47:02.080
The sesquicentennial was on July 1st

47:02.080 --> 47:06.800
and he was celebrating while Canadian original Tim Hortons.

47:06.800 --> 47:08.640
Now, what are they doing in Canada?

47:08.640 --> 47:12.960
I don't know, but they're forcing Canadian culture

47:12.960 --> 47:16.080
down the gull, the wading mall of America

47:16.080 --> 47:17.920
with some special items.

47:17.920 --> 47:20.160
Now, one is maple Timbits.

47:20.160 --> 47:22.800
They're bite-sized maple flavored donut holes.

47:23.440 --> 47:25.360
So you can get some of those if you want.

47:25.360 --> 47:28.240
Hey, no, Tim.

47:29.360 --> 47:34.320
Tim, you can't sell a menu item called Tim's bits, Tim.

47:34.320 --> 47:36.880
Timothy, you can't sell your bits, Tim.

47:36.880 --> 47:40.960
All right, I want donut holes just empty space.

47:42.560 --> 47:46.080
Come on down to Griffin's Pizza Zone and eat Griffin's nuts.

47:46.080 --> 47:49.040
All right, Griffin, you can't though.

47:49.040 --> 47:49.680
If you're sure.

47:50.880 --> 47:53.360
Why do they call them donut fillers, right?

47:53.360 --> 47:55.040
Because the hole's already in the donut.

47:56.240 --> 47:57.040
I'm going to take this one.

47:57.040 --> 48:00.320
I'm going to edit it right in after your Starbucks price discovery.

48:00.320 --> 48:03.280
If I dug dirt out of a hole, I wouldn't point at the dirt

48:03.280 --> 48:05.600
and say that's the dirt, that's the hole.

48:05.600 --> 48:07.680
No, the hole is the empty spot I made.

48:07.680 --> 48:09.360
Can I just get to my fucking thing?

48:09.360 --> 48:09.920
Yeah.

48:09.920 --> 48:12.000
The maple bacon ice cap.

48:12.000 --> 48:13.920
That's a frozen coffee drink

48:13.920 --> 48:16.480
topped with whipped cream, maple flakes, and bacon.

48:16.480 --> 48:18.000
You with me so far?

48:18.000 --> 48:19.600
Because we're about to take-

48:19.600 --> 48:20.720
Don't make me complicit in this.

48:20.720 --> 48:22.640
I don't want bacon floating around in my shit

48:22.640 --> 48:24.480
like boba bubbles or whatever.

48:24.480 --> 48:26.480
We're about to take a hard pivot here

48:26.480 --> 48:30.000
as we stop on by the poutine donut.

48:30.000 --> 48:34.800
This is a honey dipped donut with potato wedges,

48:34.800 --> 48:38.800
gravy, and cheese curds for $1.49.

48:40.240 --> 48:42.480
So you know how poutine's a thing?

48:42.480 --> 48:43.040
Yeah.

48:43.040 --> 48:44.560
And you know how donuts are a thing?

48:44.560 --> 48:46.240
And you know how Tim Hortons thinks America

48:46.240 --> 48:48.560
is a piece of shit, apparently?

48:48.560 --> 48:51.600
They're going to just put the poutine on the donut

48:51.600 --> 48:56.880
and then you pay them $1.49 and then you eat it.

48:56.880 --> 48:58.480
And I bet it's dope.

48:58.480 --> 49:00.800
It's only available for the month of July.

49:00.800 --> 49:02.160
And what?

49:02.160 --> 49:03.840
Who is perpetrating this?

49:03.840 --> 49:07.040
Well, let's check in with Philippe Atied,

49:07.040 --> 49:10.080
the EVP of Tim Hortons US.

49:11.040 --> 49:12.480
At Tim Hortons restaurants,

49:12.480 --> 49:14.400
we're proud of our Canadian heritage.

49:14.400 --> 49:16.160
That's why you're putting it on a donut?

49:16.160 --> 49:17.280
Sorry, that's me.

49:17.280 --> 49:21.200
And we want to share a piece of that in the United States.

49:21.200 --> 49:23.280
Our new Canadian inspired treats

49:23.280 --> 49:25.680
are a great way for Americans to get in

49:25.680 --> 49:29.360
on the 150th celebration of their friendly neighbor next door.

49:29.360 --> 49:32.560
Do you really think that that's an acceptable way

49:32.560 --> 49:35.280
of observing the sesquicentennial,

49:35.280 --> 49:38.160
the sesquicentennial of, one of those is right,

49:38.160 --> 49:39.600
Griffin just edited around it,

49:39.600 --> 49:44.880
of Canada is eating a gravy and French fry covered donut?

49:44.880 --> 49:47.440
Do you think that if you see a Canadian later,

49:47.440 --> 49:50.640
you're like, hey, I got in on that celebration with you.

49:50.640 --> 49:52.960
I ate the donut with gravy.

49:52.960 --> 49:56.560
Here's the sad thing I know though, Justin,

49:56.560 --> 50:00.960
is like we discuss it and in theory it's very troubling,

50:00.960 --> 50:02.880
but there will be people, many people,

50:02.880 --> 50:05.760
myself perhaps included that would see it

50:05.760 --> 50:07.200
and kind of sigh and be like,

50:07.200 --> 50:09.360
well, I guess I have to eat that now.

50:09.360 --> 50:12.960
Yeah, it's that fucking double down response of just like,

50:12.960 --> 50:15.040
ah, fuck, I mean, I have to.

50:15.040 --> 50:16.800
Okay, fine, fuck.

50:16.800 --> 50:18.800
I have a logistical question.

50:19.680 --> 50:22.000
How do they get the potato wedges on a donut?

50:22.000 --> 50:23.680
Because right now I'm sort of envisioning

50:23.680 --> 50:27.920
sort of like the crown of the witch king of Angmar situation

50:27.920 --> 50:31.040
of them just like pointing up like dangerous spires.

50:31.040 --> 50:33.600
I am looking at a picture of it on a plate,

50:33.600 --> 50:35.040
which is hysterical.

50:35.040 --> 50:36.480
It will never be on a plate.

50:38.080 --> 50:41.040
You may as well hand it to me over the counter into my mouth.

50:41.040 --> 50:43.760
And it looks like it's just been dolloped on top

50:43.760 --> 50:45.920
with all the like forethought

50:45.920 --> 50:48.560
that the creation of this dish would imply.

50:48.560 --> 50:50.880
I mean, it's a nightmare.

50:50.880 --> 50:53.040
Also, I should mention in the press release on this,

50:54.720 --> 50:56.400
sorry, this is a news story from the street.

50:56.400 --> 50:59.360
It says, poutine originated in Quebec

50:59.360 --> 51:01.760
and is typically French fries with cheese curds

51:01.760 --> 51:02.720
and gravy on top.

51:03.600 --> 51:06.880
Tim Hortons appears to be taking a leap of faith

51:06.880 --> 51:10.560
by putting this 1950s dish on a donut.

51:10.560 --> 51:14.640
Is it a leap of faith or is it pure unmitigated spite

51:14.640 --> 51:16.960
for their garbage neighbors to the south?

51:16.960 --> 51:18.800
Because that's what it feels like to me.

51:18.800 --> 51:22.160
I feel like I've lost some measure of faith

51:22.720 --> 51:25.120
after finding out that this is extant.

51:25.920 --> 51:27.680
I would fuck it up though, damn it.

51:27.680 --> 51:28.480
Yeah, yeah.

51:28.480 --> 51:30.640
Damn it, damn these, damn it.

51:30.640 --> 51:32.000
You win again, Canada.

51:32.720 --> 51:34.560
Why do I love food pranks so much?

51:34.560 --> 51:36.320
Why do I always fall for them?

51:36.320 --> 51:37.440
Always fall for the stunt.

51:37.440 --> 51:41.680
So folks, that is our show for this week.

51:41.680 --> 51:43.040
We hope you've enjoyed yourselves.

51:45.040 --> 51:46.560
Wanted to let you know, well,

51:46.560 --> 51:49.760
we mentioned we're gonna be at Comic-Con,

51:49.760 --> 51:51.280
so that's cool.

51:51.280 --> 51:52.800
We hope to see you there.

51:52.800 --> 51:54.560
If you're coming out to those shows,

51:54.560 --> 51:56.480
specifically the MBMBAM show on Saturday,

51:57.280 --> 51:59.200
please email us your questions,

52:00.320 --> 52:03.120
mbnbam at maximumfund.org

52:03.120 --> 52:06.240
and put San Diego question in the subject line

52:06.240 --> 52:09.200
so we know where you're coming from.

52:09.200 --> 52:10.560
I need lots of yahoos.

52:10.560 --> 52:13.840
Also, if you can please send me some yahoos,

52:13.840 --> 52:14.960
I would really appreciate it.

52:14.960 --> 52:15.440
Thank you.

52:15.440 --> 52:16.000
Thank you.

52:16.000 --> 52:16.480
Thank you.

52:17.200 --> 52:20.880
We also just put up pre-orders

52:20.880 --> 52:22.320
for our new graphic novel,

52:23.360 --> 52:24.320
The Adventure Zone,

52:24.320 --> 52:26.560
based on the first arc of our other podcast,

52:26.560 --> 52:27.440
The Adventure Zone.

52:28.320 --> 52:29.280
The Adventure Zone here,

52:29.280 --> 52:30.160
There'll Be Gerblins,

52:30.160 --> 52:31.840
is available for pre-order right now

52:31.840 --> 52:34.480
and we would love it if you would help us out

52:34.480 --> 52:37.600
by getting over there and pre-ordering that.

52:37.600 --> 52:42.400
You can go to theadventurezonecomic.com

52:42.400 --> 52:44.080
and pre-order it there

52:44.080 --> 52:46.640
and that would just be the best.

52:46.640 --> 52:48.400
And thank you to everybody who already pre-ordered it.

52:48.400 --> 52:52.320
We were the fucking number one book on Amazon,

52:52.880 --> 52:56.560
which is the most wild fact

52:56.560 --> 52:58.640
that has ever existed in the world.

53:01.040 --> 53:03.360
I don't know that we ever really talk about Adventure Zone

53:03.360 --> 53:04.320
that much on this show,

53:04.320 --> 53:06.160
but we're in the finale now.

53:06.160 --> 53:08.320
I think there's probably like two or three episodes left

53:08.320 --> 53:09.520
and we're gonna be wrapping up.

53:10.160 --> 53:11.200
If you haven't listened to it,

53:11.200 --> 53:14.160
I don't know how much of a Venn diagram

53:14.160 --> 53:15.200
I'm talking to right now,

53:15.200 --> 53:16.000
people who listen to this show

53:16.000 --> 53:17.600
and have not listened to Adventure Zone.

53:17.600 --> 53:20.240
I'm so proud of what it has turned into

53:20.240 --> 53:23.680
and I would encourage everybody to go and give it a shot.

53:23.680 --> 53:26.080
It starts out with us just kind of playing D&D

53:26.080 --> 53:27.040
and not understanding the rules

53:27.040 --> 53:31.920
and it's turned into something that is the creative endeavor

53:31.920 --> 53:33.200
that I am most proud of,

53:33.200 --> 53:34.720
of anything in my whole life.

53:34.720 --> 53:37.680
So please go give it a listen if you haven't tried it out.

53:37.680 --> 53:40.160
You got like a month to catch up before the finale

53:40.160 --> 53:44.080
and it's probably gonna be popping off on a major way.

53:44.080 --> 53:45.680
So don't let yourself be spoiled.

53:45.680 --> 53:48.240
Just get over and listen to all of the Adventure Zone.

53:48.240 --> 53:49.840
There's an episode 1.5

53:49.840 --> 53:52.320
that's like a shorter version of our pilot

53:52.320 --> 53:53.600
that Travis put together

53:53.600 --> 53:55.120
that is like an easier way to onboard.

53:56.240 --> 53:57.840
And then around like episode five or six

53:57.840 --> 54:00.800
is where it sort of takes off into its own thing.

54:00.800 --> 54:03.360
So yeah, go give it a listen.

54:03.360 --> 54:05.280
Thank you to John Roderick and the Long Winters

54:05.280 --> 54:06.160
for the use of our theme song,

54:06.160 --> 54:08.320
It's a Departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

54:08.320 --> 54:10.320
Go check that one out.

54:10.320 --> 54:12.080
Also, thank you to Maximum Fun for having us.

54:12.080 --> 54:14.960

54:31.040 --> 54:33.600
Great, and we have one more question

54:33.600 --> 54:35.920
to sort of ruminate on in the coming week.

54:35.920 --> 54:37.680
Griffin, if you would be so kind.

54:37.680 --> 54:38.320
Yeah, sure.

54:38.320 --> 54:39.600
This one's sent by Brooks Oglesby.

54:41.280 --> 54:42.640
Heather Helm asks,

54:44.240 --> 54:47.200
did Nostradamus really write something

54:47.200 --> 54:49.600
about Gangnam Style getting a billion hits?

54:52.320 --> 54:53.920
My name is Justin McElroy.

54:53.920 --> 54:55.440
I'm Travis McElroy.

54:55.440 --> 54:56.560
I'm Griffin McElroy.

54:56.560 --> 54:57.840
This has been My Brother, My Brother and Me.

54:57.840 --> 55:11.360
Kiss your dad, square on the lips.

55:27.840 --> 55:41.360
Kiss your dad, square on the lips.
