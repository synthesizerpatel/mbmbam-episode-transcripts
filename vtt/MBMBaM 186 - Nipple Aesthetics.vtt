00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:49.600
Hello and welcome to my brother, my brother and me, an advice show for the modern era.

00:49.600 --> 00:53.760
Batten down the hatches, it's Great Iron Day, and I'm Justin McElroy. I'm Travis McElroy,

00:53.760 --> 00:57.040
your middle-est brother. I'm your baby brother, Griffin McElroy. Get your belt,

00:57.040 --> 01:01.280
attach your belt to you and Helen Hunt, and then wrap it around that pipe,

01:01.280 --> 01:05.760
and you're not going anywhere when the football NATO comes. Football storms are coming,

01:07.520 --> 01:12.400
hailstorm touchdowns, hailstorms the size of footballs. My knee's been aching all day.

01:12.400 --> 01:17.120
You know what that means? That usually means it's gonna be just a touchdown NATO. Oh shit,

01:17.120 --> 01:25.200
Peyton coming. Guys, are you fucking ready? Are you fucking ready? Have you prepared yourself?

01:25.200 --> 01:29.280
Have you made yourself ready, you and your home and your families? Are you armed? Well,

01:29.280 --> 01:35.600
better question, have you prepared your soul? For the football resurrection. Yeah, what's gonna

01:35.600 --> 01:39.840
happen to you after the football comes? I've got some literature here I'd really like you guys to

01:39.840 --> 01:46.240
read. Have you prepared your soul for when Peyton Manning comes for you? He could come at any time.

01:46.240 --> 01:51.680
As he does for all of us. That's what's so scary. I can't go in Papa John's anymore because Peyton

01:51.680 --> 01:58.240
Manning is in all Papa John's simultaneously. I don't know if you guys know this, but Papa John

01:58.240 --> 02:05.120
created a demonic portal that he ensnared Peyton Manning in. He lets him out every football game

02:05.120 --> 02:11.440
day. Otherwise, he is simultaneously in every Papa John's at once. Have you ever seen Multiplicity?

02:11.440 --> 02:15.520
It's like that. It's a lot like that. Next time you're in Papa John's, do me a favor, look in a

02:15.520 --> 02:22.640
mirror, think about Gatorade. Oops, who's there? Peyton Manning's behind you. I think that the end

02:23.280 --> 02:30.480
will basically be Peyton Manning gathering up all the world's bad people in Las Vegas

02:31.040 --> 02:40.720
and Eli Manning gathering all the good people. Now who's he? Sorry, Eli? Yeah. He's his brother.

02:40.720 --> 02:47.840
He's the malformed clone of Peyton Manning. Oh, I see. So to continue the Multiplicity riff,

02:47.840 --> 02:54.240
it would be like if Michael Keaton, if one of his clones was just a torso without a head.

02:54.880 --> 03:00.000
When Peyton Manning was born, William Refrigerator Perry took one of his ribs

03:00.000 --> 03:06.240
and from that rib, he formed Eli. He put a salty rub on it, he marinated it in some sauce,

03:06.240 --> 03:13.120
and then he was ready for the big game. He was. He needed a few dips and he was ready. Football

03:13.120 --> 03:21.040
is coming and I don't think you can ever be too ready for football. This may be our last

03:21.040 --> 03:27.040
transmission. We may get swept away by a gridiron fever tonight, which is a literal disease.

03:28.640 --> 03:31.920
Let me actually- It strikes the young, the elderly,

03:31.920 --> 03:39.680
the middle-aged people who are in their 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s, just everybody.

03:39.680 --> 03:41.440
Cheese. All the decades.

03:41.440 --> 03:45.280
Cheese heads. It gets cheese heads real hard. It gets parrot heads.

03:45.280 --> 03:49.360
Parrot heads. You guys got a favorite? Who are you pulling for?

03:50.000 --> 03:53.760
I'm rooting for Nate Irving. Oh, me too. I was going to say the exact same thing.

03:53.760 --> 04:05.520
Nate Irving. In my favorite quote of the week, Nate Irving was asked how he was going to unwind

04:05.520 --> 04:10.880
before the big game and he said, I'm going to sit up in my hotel room and play my Pokemon game.

04:14.160 --> 04:17.040
I love you, Nate Irving. You're the best football player.

04:17.040 --> 04:21.520
According to the Wall Street Journal, he promises he won't spend all his time playing Pokemon. He

04:21.520 --> 04:26.160
might occasionally mix things up by watching HGTV. Did you guys know that I'm a professional

04:26.160 --> 04:30.320
fucking football player and my name is Nate Irving? Did you guys know that about me?

04:31.040 --> 04:33.680
I'm basically the best football player.

04:33.680 --> 04:38.240
I'm super good. I set a career record with 41 tackles this season. I'm super,

04:38.240 --> 04:41.760
super good and I didn't know it. Yeah, that's all you need.

04:41.760 --> 04:45.440
We are on a boat and our destination is self-discovery island.

04:45.440 --> 04:49.920
Well, can you imagine Nate Irving, the Braggers win the Super Bowl and it's like,

04:49.920 --> 04:53.600
Nate Irving, are you excited? He's like, I am excited. I won the Super Bowl

04:53.600 --> 04:57.360
and I also beat the trainer I've been trying to beat for like the last two weeks.

04:58.720 --> 05:02.480
I don't think he has any trouble beating any kind of trainers. I'm just saying,

05:02.480 --> 05:04.480
I think he's probably- Oh wait, so you just assume

05:04.480 --> 05:08.080
because he's an excellent football man that he's also really good at the Pokemon.

05:08.080 --> 05:12.560
That's what he's terrible at Pokemon and it's just, football is not a challenge for him anymore.

05:13.200 --> 05:16.640
He just can't wrap his mind around like the different type sets,

05:16.640 --> 05:20.560
the different elemental strengths and weaknesses. I can't remember what psychic is strong again.

05:20.560 --> 05:23.840
What is psychic strong again? What beats bugs? Ah, damn it.

05:23.840 --> 05:28.240
My girlfriend spends the night at my place more often than not while I tolerate her hair dryer,

05:28.240 --> 05:32.000
hair straightener, and assorted other energy guzzling beauty accoutrement.

05:32.000 --> 05:36.160
I can't stand when she makes changes to the thermostat in the morning after I've left and

05:36.160 --> 05:40.240
heats the condo up to tropical temperatures while nobody is home to enjoy it. I've tried asking

05:40.240 --> 05:46.880
politely, but my electric bill has gone up more than 300% from December to January.

05:47.840 --> 05:53.440
What is a conservation minded boyfriend to do? And that's from Chile in Chicago.

05:54.560 --> 05:58.000
You could do what my landlord does and put a lock box around the thermostat.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.440
That should be good for the relationship.

06:00.320 --> 06:03.520
Hey honey, you can't be trusted. Bye, I'll see you at work.

06:03.520 --> 06:04.320
I put- Love you.

06:04.320 --> 06:10.480
Also, I put all your hair dryers and stuff in a separate lock box, and only I know the password.

06:10.480 --> 06:16.400
I'm going to dip back into the Bim Bam Classics folder and dig out this one because I think it's

06:16.400 --> 06:23.280
appropriate. Go to the thermostat and just put a little jelly on it. Ugh. I went to change the

06:23.280 --> 06:26.640
thermostat and my hand got all this jelly everywhere. I hate this.

06:26.640 --> 06:30.160
Right, but- Maybe the problem is what kind of jelly?

06:31.120 --> 06:32.560
Right, and this person- Just before we move on.

06:32.560 --> 06:38.320
This person is leading a conservation based lifestyle, and that's admirable. You can have

06:38.320 --> 06:43.440
the patience and the willingness to sacrifice all of the good things in the world to live like that.

06:44.000 --> 06:49.760
Good kudos. This person does not want to waste jelly like that. That is jelly that could be

06:49.760 --> 06:56.080
eaten by a person who really needs some jelly to eat, and you're wasting it. You're using it

06:56.080 --> 07:00.560
as a punitive measure, and that does not seem like something a conservationist would be into.

07:00.560 --> 07:04.560
Let me throw this out. Maybe the problem is you can't take something away without presenting

07:04.560 --> 07:10.400
another option, so if you say you can't raise the thermostat, maybe you also give her a barrel that

07:10.400 --> 07:15.360
she can burn some newspaper and scrap wood in. Oh, so like a one in, one out,

07:15.360 --> 07:17.840
fuck the earth sort of policy. Yeah.

07:17.840 --> 07:22.960
Okay. A literal scorched earth policy, because if you do that too much, this rock will be

07:22.960 --> 07:28.800
uninhabitable. Yes, but it's not like it's going to pollute the outside. It's inside his apartment.

07:28.800 --> 07:34.640
As long as he never opens a door or window and releases the toxic fumes he's built up in there.

07:34.640 --> 07:36.880
Yes. How do you get anybody to do anything?

07:37.760 --> 07:42.240
Guilt. Buy an animal that's susceptible to heat. And let it die?

07:42.960 --> 07:45.440
And let it die at once. Build a snowman in your living room.

07:45.440 --> 07:48.480
What? Put a snowman in your living room and make her love it.

07:48.480 --> 07:52.640
Yeah, put a snowman in the living room and tell her that via a magical instrument,

07:52.640 --> 07:57.840
it has become possessed with the spirit of your dead relative, and then when she turns the

07:57.840 --> 08:01.680
thermostat out of her mouth, just start screaming. No, she won't. She won't care about that. Just

08:01.680 --> 08:07.600
make it look like Benedict Cumberbatch. She'll- Is that what- Hold the fucking phone. Is that what,

08:07.600 --> 08:11.600
like, is that what ladies are into right now? That's what ladies are into right now.

08:12.480 --> 08:17.440
That's, I don't know. That's what they're into. His, I mean, I get, like, he's a tremendous actor,

08:17.440 --> 08:22.400
and of course, like, who doesn't love Benedict Cumberbatch? But I never thought about him on,

08:22.400 --> 08:27.440
like, an erotic level. He's got so many ridges. He's got a lot of ridges on that dome.

08:27.440 --> 08:32.000
I think right now, if ladies could just watch Benedict Cumberbatch

08:32.000 --> 08:34.880
and Tom Hiddleston just, like, rub their faces together.

08:34.880 --> 08:37.040
That's all they want. They just want that.

08:37.040 --> 08:40.080
He has a lot of ridges, too. That's a lot. It's like two, like,

08:40.080 --> 08:44.160
ski slalom courses, just, like, rubbing, rubbing, making friction.

08:44.800 --> 08:46.800
And that's, and that's the new thing.

08:47.360 --> 08:47.760
Ridges.

08:47.760 --> 08:48.800
Ski slaloms.

08:48.800 --> 08:50.880
I gots to get some fucking dome ridges.

08:50.880 --> 08:56.800
But apparently dome ridges are where it's at. I'm as surprised as anybody, honestly.

08:57.680 --> 08:59.920
So I guess those are some pretty good suggestions.

08:59.920 --> 09:02.240
Can't wait. Can you ask her to pay for the extra 200%?

09:02.960 --> 09:05.200
Oh my god. Split the utility bill with her.

09:05.200 --> 09:06.080
Yeah. Or-

09:06.080 --> 09:07.120
Then she can do what she wants.

09:07.120 --> 09:09.440
Just ask her to be more fucking considerate.

09:10.080 --> 09:12.960
Please. Just be considerate of my feelings.

09:13.600 --> 09:15.680
Buy her a giant sweatshirt that she can wrap herself in.

09:15.680 --> 09:19.040
Hold on. Wait a minute. Are you dating a salamander?

09:19.040 --> 09:21.440
Because if you're dating a salamander,

09:21.440 --> 09:24.720
then you need to be conscious of her lifestyle needs.

09:25.360 --> 09:27.600
And maybe you eat the extra-

09:27.600 --> 09:30.720
I mean, guys, I lived in Chicago. Energy ain't cheap.

09:32.240 --> 09:32.640
Energy-

09:32.640 --> 09:33.840
And it gets cold up there.

09:33.840 --> 09:36.480
It gets cold up there. And there's only so much gas.

09:36.480 --> 09:43.120
And if energy raiders come by your street, you have to fight them off.

09:43.120 --> 09:47.920
But if this woman needs heat, or else her salamander skin will turn to dust, and she dies.

09:49.040 --> 09:50.800
It's just how salamanders work.

09:50.800 --> 09:54.560
Here's a Yahoo. I'm just going to stop asking if you guys want it,

09:54.560 --> 09:55.840
because the answer is never no.

09:56.640 --> 09:57.200
That's true.

09:58.240 --> 10:02.640
This one was sent in by Carolyn Flynn, or Caroline Flynn. Thank you, Caroline. Or Carolyn.

10:02.640 --> 10:06.160
It's by Yahoo answer user Megan, who asks, what should I wear to a club?

10:07.520 --> 10:08.020
Hey.

10:08.880 --> 10:09.380
Hey.

10:10.160 --> 10:10.660
Hey.

10:10.640 --> 10:12.480
I'm not going to ask you that.

10:12.480 --> 10:16.480
I'm 19, and I'm going to a club that's for 16 to 20-year-olds.

10:16.480 --> 10:17.520
Kind of a crazy club.

10:18.160 --> 10:19.600
And I'm not sure what to wear.

10:19.600 --> 10:22.960
I don't want to look like a slut, but I want to look a little sexy.

10:22.960 --> 10:24.400
There's a couple things I will not wear.

10:24.400 --> 10:27.200
I absolutely despise skinny jeans, so I refuse to wear those.

10:27.200 --> 10:30.560
And as far as shoes, I don't want to wear heels, because they hurt my knees.

10:30.560 --> 10:34.160
And I can't wear flats, because I have to find ones that fit.

10:34.160 --> 10:36.400
Other than those few things, I'm pretty much open to anything.

10:36.400 --> 10:40.000
I'm 5'5", 115 pounds. So I'm pretty skinny.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.720
I have a butt and boobs, but neither are huge.

10:42.720 --> 10:45.680
Did you need to point out that you have a butt and boobs?

10:46.800 --> 10:49.520
I have a butt. My legs do not just connect to my waist.

10:49.520 --> 10:51.760
I'm an amorphous blob who poops through her belly button.

10:53.920 --> 10:54.800
That's my line.

10:54.800 --> 10:55.280
So there's that.

10:55.280 --> 10:57.520
That's why I hate skinny jeans so much. I don't have legs.

10:57.520 --> 10:58.400
I hate skinny jeans.

10:58.400 --> 10:59.840
Oh, and one more thing.

10:59.840 --> 11:02.880
I'm a living blob.

11:02.880 --> 11:05.040
So there's not really anything I can't wear.

11:05.040 --> 11:06.240
I'm getting pretty full of yourself.

11:06.240 --> 11:11.120
So if you guys could maybe put links in with your answers,

11:11.120 --> 11:13.280
so I can get a better idea of what you're thinking, that would be great.

11:13.280 --> 11:13.780
Thanks.

11:15.200 --> 11:16.080
A teen club?

11:16.880 --> 11:18.160
Those exist, dude.

11:18.160 --> 11:19.120
I guess Huntington had...

11:19.120 --> 11:25.920
We had the gym factory, which was a trampoline emporium.

11:25.920 --> 11:27.040
But in the back room...

11:27.040 --> 11:27.760
By day.

11:27.760 --> 11:29.280
Trampoline emporium by day.

11:29.280 --> 11:31.520
By night, a teen hotspot.

11:31.520 --> 11:34.800
Which is where fucking eighth graders learn to bump and grind.

11:34.800 --> 11:36.000
Which, how do you-

11:36.000 --> 11:38.400
Here in Flannaddy, we have a place called Blast.

11:39.520 --> 11:40.560
Oh, no.

11:40.560 --> 11:42.000
It's a teen club.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.760
It's the same principle?

11:44.640 --> 11:50.960
Yeah, except it's a full-on nightclub in Newport on the Levee.

11:50.960 --> 11:54.000
And I think it's open Fridays and Saturdays.

11:54.000 --> 11:59.200
And then they card people to get in, and then they serve Red Bull and Gatorade.

11:59.200 --> 12:01.520
And just a fucking cave.

12:01.520 --> 12:06.640
When they ID them, if they're older than like 20, they don't let them in?

12:07.360 --> 12:08.400
Don't let them in.

12:08.400 --> 12:11.520
But when you look at the place, what's crazy, if I may, for a moment.

12:11.520 --> 12:15.040
What's crazy about it is it looks like someone said,

12:15.040 --> 12:16.960
hey parents, don't worry, it's going to be totally safe.

12:16.960 --> 12:18.080
We're going to keep an eye on it.

12:18.080 --> 12:18.720
Kids, don't worry.

12:18.720 --> 12:20.880
We've really set this up so you guys can fucking do-

12:20.880 --> 12:23.280
No, I remember our teen club, the gym factory,

12:23.280 --> 12:26.560
was the fucking grossest place I've ever been.

12:26.560 --> 12:28.640
Like, I'm 26 now.

12:28.640 --> 12:31.520
I have not been to a place that allowed drinking

12:31.520 --> 12:35.680
that was like 10% as gross as the gym factory was,

12:35.680 --> 12:39.440
because it was just like a bunch of eighth-year-olds,

12:39.440 --> 12:41.680
eighth-year-olds, just a bunch of eighth graders

12:41.680 --> 12:44.560
just fucking gyrating and just like pupating

12:44.560 --> 12:47.120
and emerging from their sexual chrysalis

12:47.120 --> 12:48.960
to become like a bunch of fuck moths

12:50.960 --> 12:52.960
attracted to some genital flames.

12:54.080 --> 12:56.240
Are you talking about the same gym factory

12:56.240 --> 12:58.720
where there's like rope swings and there were phone pits?

12:58.720 --> 12:59.280
No kidding.

13:00.400 --> 13:03.760
I think I had like my fifth-grade birthday party there.

13:03.760 --> 13:06.240
Three years later, I was like fucking

13:06.800 --> 13:08.720
jizzing inside my jinko jeans.

13:12.160 --> 13:13.120
I'm thinking about it now.

13:13.120 --> 13:14.560
That place is crazy.

13:15.920 --> 13:16.800
That's crazy.

13:17.680 --> 13:19.760
The fact that teen clubs exist is crazy enough,

13:19.760 --> 13:23.840
but also there's like the world's biggest jungle gym

13:23.840 --> 13:26.880
and around the corner is like a fucking-

13:26.880 --> 13:27.600
Dry humping.

13:27.600 --> 13:30.640
Is dry humping the teen red light district.

13:34.000 --> 13:37.680
Anyway, what's this young woman going to wear?

13:38.480 --> 13:40.000
A chastity belt.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.080
I would wear a-

13:42.080 --> 13:43.680
From extremerestraints.com.

13:43.680 --> 13:46.320
I would wear a chain that you can attach to your leg

13:46.320 --> 13:48.560
that keeps you from going to this place.

13:49.600 --> 13:50.720
Yeah, it's treacherous.

13:50.720 --> 13:52.800
How about just some kind of like harness

13:52.800 --> 13:55.760
so that if you get in too deep, you can tug the rope

13:55.760 --> 13:57.280
and your parents can pull you out

13:58.000 --> 13:59.200
so that you don't get trapped there.

13:59.200 --> 14:00.800
You want your parents watching you.

14:01.600 --> 14:04.160
You want your parents to be your spotters in this event.

14:04.160 --> 14:06.160
Yeah, they're at a safe distance.

14:06.160 --> 14:08.880
I want it tied to the back of the caravan

14:08.880 --> 14:11.440
so you tug the rope and they just floor it

14:11.440 --> 14:13.360
and you go flying out the front door.

14:13.360 --> 14:14.400
Oh, shit's going down.

14:14.400 --> 14:15.600
Get me out of here, moms.

14:17.600 --> 14:19.600
Hey, do you want to ride on yourself?

14:19.600 --> 14:21.760
You want to ride on yourself with this neon highlighter?

14:21.760 --> 14:23.440
It's just stuff to do because we can't drink.

14:23.440 --> 14:24.240
Uh, yeah, hold on.

14:24.240 --> 14:27.200
Let me just pull on this rope three times and bye.

14:27.840 --> 14:28.340
Bye.

14:29.040 --> 14:29.540
Maybe a-

14:30.640 --> 14:31.920
How about a nice blouse?

14:33.600 --> 14:34.800
Maybe a pantsuit.

14:34.800 --> 14:35.920
Pantsuit, yeah.

14:36.880 --> 14:37.600
I like that.

14:38.640 --> 14:40.240
The kids, you know what the kids like nowadays?

14:40.240 --> 14:41.840
They like writing on themselves

14:41.840 --> 14:42.800
just because they can't drink

14:42.800 --> 14:43.920
and they just need something to do.

14:44.640 --> 14:46.560
And they're really into Margaret Thatcher.

14:46.560 --> 14:47.200
Just like her style.

14:47.200 --> 14:48.640
You know what I want to come back?

14:48.640 --> 14:49.680
Shoulder pads.

14:49.680 --> 14:50.480
Oh, yeah.

14:50.480 --> 14:52.160
God, man, if-

14:53.200 --> 14:56.480
I can't believe as ironic as everyone and everything is

14:56.480 --> 14:58.320
all the time forever now

14:58.320 --> 15:02.800
that those haven't really reared their ugly flat heads.

15:02.800 --> 15:05.280
That's got to be hard for like their creator,

15:06.080 --> 15:08.560
Paul shoulder pads.

15:08.560 --> 15:10.320
Yeah, wait, look at these.

15:11.040 --> 15:11.680
Come on, man.

15:11.680 --> 15:12.240
These are bulky.

15:12.240 --> 15:13.360
Hey, guys, look at me.

15:13.360 --> 15:16.720
And then like a guy that's like wearing a suit

15:16.720 --> 15:21.040
that he bought from the set of Hanging with Mr. Cooper is like,

15:21.040 --> 15:22.080
dude, I don't know.

15:22.080 --> 15:24.160
That is a little too much for me.

15:24.160 --> 15:24.880
Shoulder pads?

15:24.880 --> 15:25.680
A little much.

15:25.680 --> 15:26.320
I don't know.

15:26.960 --> 15:29.520
Let me clean off the fake lenses in my glasses.

15:29.520 --> 15:31.360
Let me clean those out real quick.

15:31.360 --> 15:32.080
Sorry.

15:32.080 --> 15:33.760
I want to look like David Byrne,

15:33.760 --> 15:35.760
but you look a little too much like David Byrne.

15:35.760 --> 15:36.400
Does that make sense?

15:37.040 --> 15:37.520
Yeah.

15:37.520 --> 15:39.360
I want like 75% Byrne.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.120
If you go too much over that,

15:41.120 --> 15:42.480
then you just look silly.

15:43.040 --> 15:44.080
You know, I'm going to go on a limb

15:44.080 --> 15:48.320
and I'm going to say the next big thing is blazers

15:48.320 --> 15:50.880
that are nautical themed with shoulder pads.

15:50.880 --> 15:52.800
So like the buttons have the anchors on them.

15:52.800 --> 15:53.280
Yeah, sure.

15:53.280 --> 15:56.160
Maybe there's like a blue and white stripe thing going on,

15:56.160 --> 15:58.560
but it's definitely has a nautical flare

15:59.200 --> 15:59.920
and shoulder pad.

15:59.920 --> 16:00.480
Oh my God.

16:00.480 --> 16:02.640
I'd give up everything to follow that style.

16:02.640 --> 16:05.120
Maybe you got some sardines, some sardines in the pocket.

16:05.760 --> 16:06.000
Yeah.

16:06.560 --> 16:06.880
Sailors.

16:06.880 --> 16:07.120
Oh yeah.

16:07.120 --> 16:08.800
It's a full sensory experience.

16:08.800 --> 16:11.600
Sight, smell, sound, you know, you open up the coat

16:11.600 --> 16:13.520
and the speakers play the sound of the ocean.

16:13.520 --> 16:14.560
It's so important.

16:14.560 --> 16:15.840
If you're going to a teen club,

16:15.840 --> 16:19.040
you have to put together a full sensory experience.

16:20.080 --> 16:20.640
You know why?

16:20.640 --> 16:22.880
It's A, it's because it says something about you.

16:22.880 --> 16:23.920
I'm in the boats.

16:23.920 --> 16:24.720
Hey, what's up?

16:24.720 --> 16:26.400
I'm a child of the ocean.

16:26.400 --> 16:27.840
That's sort of my style.

16:27.840 --> 16:29.520
But more importantly than that,

16:29.520 --> 16:32.640
you want to be able to transport yourself to anywhere

16:32.640 --> 16:35.120
but the place you are, which is a teen club.

16:37.360 --> 16:39.840
Can you guys explain the science to me?

16:39.840 --> 16:41.120
Is it just, is it?

16:41.120 --> 16:44.640
It doesn't make any sense to me that a club where you can drink

16:44.640 --> 16:47.280
and get fucked up and like hang out with adults,

16:47.280 --> 16:49.360
all of whom are of consenting ages,

16:49.360 --> 16:53.040
is less gross than a place where you cannot drink

16:53.040 --> 16:54.400
and everyone's in high school.

16:55.360 --> 16:58.480
Because the one thing the teen club lacks is excuses.

16:59.760 --> 17:00.960
Everything that's happening there

17:00.960 --> 17:03.520
is completely generated by hormones.

17:04.160 --> 17:06.080
It's Sodom and Gomorrah is what it is.

17:07.520 --> 17:08.400
Right, exactly.

17:08.400 --> 17:10.400
It's just a pavilion of carnality.

17:10.400 --> 17:11.040
Don't look back.

17:11.040 --> 17:13.360
And you can't blame any of it on alcohol.

17:13.360 --> 17:14.640
Don't look back at the gym factory.

17:14.640 --> 17:14.960
Just go.

17:15.520 --> 17:16.000
Just go.

17:16.000 --> 17:16.880
Oh, your salt.

17:16.880 --> 17:18.080
Now your pill of salt.

17:18.080 --> 17:18.640
You fucked up.

17:19.360 --> 17:20.480
Well, here's the problem, Griffin.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.720
At an adult club with adult people,

17:22.720 --> 17:25.520
they also have adult reasoning and stuff like,

17:25.520 --> 17:27.600
I just can't go up and grind on this person.

17:27.600 --> 17:28.560
I work with them.

17:28.560 --> 17:30.160
No, I think you're right about the hormones.

17:30.160 --> 17:30.800
I think that's it.

17:30.800 --> 17:33.200
That is a fucking cocktail, man.

17:34.800 --> 17:35.760
Eighth grade?

17:35.760 --> 17:37.120
Fucking forget about it.

17:37.120 --> 17:41.200
I'm usually, I guess, like 98% water and 2% meat.

17:41.200 --> 17:45.680
And then back there, I was just like from the waist down.

17:45.680 --> 17:46.880
100% bone.

17:46.880 --> 17:49.440
Just like bone zone all the way.

17:50.480 --> 17:55.120
When I was in eighth grade, I was in a computer class.

17:55.840 --> 18:00.480
And our teacher, he was an overweight man,

18:01.280 --> 18:04.560
angry at the world, seemed to hate pretty much everything.

18:04.560 --> 18:05.040
Now hold on.

18:05.040 --> 18:07.280
This was a computer class teacher?

18:07.280 --> 18:07.760
Now wait.

18:07.760 --> 18:09.280
That doesn't sound right.

18:09.280 --> 18:10.880
He seemed to hate everything.

18:10.880 --> 18:14.400
Every single thing about his life seemed to make him miserable.

18:14.400 --> 18:18.000
And the very first thing he said to us on the first day

18:18.560 --> 18:20.560
of this eighth grade computer class was,

18:21.200 --> 18:25.680
I wouldn't trade places with any of you for love or money.

18:26.640 --> 18:32.720
That's how this guy's game was so whack in his entire life.

18:32.720 --> 18:35.120
His entire life circle was off kilter.

18:35.120 --> 18:38.400
And yet, he would not trade places

18:38.400 --> 18:40.880
with a young, vibrant eighth grader.

18:40.880 --> 18:43.200
Vibrant my balls.

18:43.200 --> 18:46.720
That is, I wasn't, nobody's vibrant when they're in eighth grade.

18:46.720 --> 18:49.920
They're just like exuding weird, like chemicals and shit.

18:49.920 --> 18:52.320
They're just like, they have a sheen of slime.

18:52.320 --> 18:54.720
They're just a bunch of like jizz slugs.

18:54.720 --> 18:56.160
I fucking, oh.

18:56.160 --> 18:58.320
They have a slime of sheen actually too.

19:00.240 --> 19:01.920
Man, we went through some shit

19:01.920 --> 19:04.560
and we came out on the other side so much stronger.

19:04.560 --> 19:06.720
I recently got out of a four-year relationship.

19:06.720 --> 19:09.680
By both of our accounts, we were very happy together.

19:09.680 --> 19:12.720
But my ex was never ready to commit to marriage.

19:12.720 --> 19:14.160
And I got tired of waiting.

19:14.160 --> 19:17.040
I'm 33 and he's 38, BT dubs.

19:17.040 --> 19:19.360
And this is LA, if that makes a difference.

19:19.360 --> 19:19.840
Of course.

19:19.840 --> 19:20.400
We love it.

19:21.600 --> 19:23.360
I've started seeing other people.

19:23.360 --> 19:24.640
My question is this.

19:24.640 --> 19:28.240
How can I avoid getting involved with another commitment-phobe?

19:28.240 --> 19:30.000
I'm definitely not desperate to get married,

19:30.000 --> 19:32.480
but I am ready to find a life partner.

19:32.480 --> 19:35.840
At what point in a new relationship should I bring this up?

19:35.840 --> 19:38.720
After a few dates, a few weeks, months?

19:38.720 --> 19:40.240
I basically want to say,

19:40.240 --> 19:42.480
I only date guys who are interested in marriage.

19:42.480 --> 19:42.960
Don't do that.

19:42.960 --> 19:46.720
I don't want to come across as crazy, pathetic, or desperate.

19:46.720 --> 19:47.600
What's your advice?

19:47.600 --> 19:48.240
Thanks a lot.

19:48.240 --> 19:48.560
All right.

19:48.560 --> 19:51.920
Don't like, the labels of crazy, pathetic, or desperate

19:51.920 --> 19:53.920
have nothing to do with it.

19:53.920 --> 19:57.680
It's just like, it's almost like rude in a way.

19:57.680 --> 20:00.480
It's just like a weird thing to float by somebody.

20:00.480 --> 20:02.080
Put it on a completely different,

20:02.080 --> 20:04.000
like put it in a different framework and say,

20:04.000 --> 20:06.640
it's like walking into a job interview and say,

20:07.280 --> 20:09.440
hi, I'm such and such.

20:10.400 --> 20:11.440
I'm here to interview.

20:11.440 --> 20:13.840
And I want you to know, I'll only take this job

20:13.840 --> 20:16.160
if eventually I get to be CEO.

20:16.160 --> 20:18.400
I've got my eye on a management position.

20:18.400 --> 20:19.040
Yeah.

20:19.040 --> 20:22.240
And I won't accept the job if you can't guarantee

20:22.240 --> 20:23.600
that that's going to happen.

20:23.600 --> 20:26.080
It's like, oh, we just met.

20:26.080 --> 20:27.920
Like, I don't know.

20:27.920 --> 20:31.760
I think by its very nature, commitment

20:31.760 --> 20:37.360
in the context of a relationship has to be 100% holistic.

20:38.000 --> 20:42.320
It cannot be forced or artificial in any way.

20:42.320 --> 20:45.360
Because this person that you dated

20:45.360 --> 20:48.000
and you guys had a good relationship

20:48.000 --> 20:49.520
and you were very happy together,

20:49.520 --> 20:51.360
but if you guys were that happy

20:51.360 --> 20:53.360
and you spent that much time together

20:53.360 --> 20:55.680
and he still didn't want to commit,

20:55.680 --> 20:59.040
that has always to me seemed like evidence

20:59.040 --> 21:01.360
of other shit going on.

21:01.360 --> 21:02.000
Yeah.

21:02.000 --> 21:05.280
What I've found is that if people aren't ready,

21:05.280 --> 21:07.280
like if people are afraid of commitment,

21:08.160 --> 21:09.760
even if they have rules for themselves,

21:09.760 --> 21:12.000
I'm not looking for something serious.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.320
I'm not looking for a lifelong thing.

21:14.320 --> 21:16.800
If it's right and it's the right relationship,

21:16.800 --> 21:20.720
it's the right pairing, then that kind of commitment,

21:20.720 --> 21:24.800
even if it's not, you know, marriage will follow.

21:24.800 --> 21:26.640
I mean, that you will want to

21:26.640 --> 21:29.280
just because you'll be into something so great

21:29.280 --> 21:30.720
that you don't want to get out of it.

21:30.720 --> 21:33.120
Maybe that's an overly romantic way of looking at things,

21:33.120 --> 21:35.200
but that's seemed to be my experience.

21:35.200 --> 21:35.920
No, I agree.

21:35.920 --> 21:40.080
And I think the problem is that asking early on like,

21:40.080 --> 21:42.400
hey, I just want to know that you're the type of person

21:42.400 --> 21:43.920
that I feel like it's cheating

21:43.920 --> 21:45.840
because I feel like it's like, you got to get to know.

21:45.840 --> 21:48.640
And that's why starting a new relationship is always scary

21:48.640 --> 21:50.880
because there are so many unanswered questions

21:50.880 --> 21:52.560
that you learn over time

21:52.560 --> 21:54.960
and wanting to get all those questions out of the way early

21:54.960 --> 21:56.880
so you don't have to worry about it.

21:56.880 --> 21:59.680
I think it takes a lot away from the discovery

21:59.680 --> 22:03.280
and the newness of it all and getting to know the person.

22:03.280 --> 22:06.480
So my honest answer is I don't think you can.

22:06.480 --> 22:08.480
I think you just have to get to know them

22:08.480 --> 22:10.800
and come to that conversation naturally

22:10.800 --> 22:12.560
because I think if you try to force it

22:13.120 --> 22:16.480
and it sounds like you're eager to have that conversation,

22:16.480 --> 22:21.440
so chances are it's not going to come about naturally

22:21.440 --> 22:23.920
of its own accord and so it will probably not be

22:23.920 --> 22:24.880
at the right time.

22:24.880 --> 22:27.360
And Laurie, you may find that you,

22:27.360 --> 22:29.280
if you force that question too early,

22:29.280 --> 22:31.040
you may find yourself in a relationship

22:31.040 --> 22:34.480
that you don't want to commit to but are enjoying

22:34.480 --> 22:38.160
and the other person's ready to like bat down the hatches

22:38.160 --> 22:39.120
and get hit.

22:39.120 --> 22:41.920
Which is so much shittier than the alternative.

22:41.920 --> 22:43.040
It's way worse.

22:43.040 --> 22:44.640
It's a lot, it's a lot worse.

22:45.200 --> 22:48.000
To your credit, it's really, really good

22:48.000 --> 22:49.600
that you look back on that older,

22:49.600 --> 22:51.600
the last relationship that you were in

22:52.160 --> 22:54.000
and you're still happy about it

22:54.000 --> 22:56.240
because you recognize that you like had a good time

22:56.240 --> 22:58.480
and you grew from it even though it didn't result

22:58.480 --> 23:00.480
in like a lifelong thing.

23:00.480 --> 23:03.360
Because if you don't look at your stuff like that,

23:03.360 --> 23:04.640
that will drive you crazy.

23:04.640 --> 23:06.800
Like, oh, four years, just gone.

23:06.800 --> 23:07.920
Yeah, and you don't want to,

23:07.920 --> 23:10.720
you don't want to be in a relationship

23:10.720 --> 23:12.000
for four years again like that.

23:12.000 --> 23:13.840
If somebody doesn't want to commit to you,

23:13.840 --> 23:14.880
Laurie, you're the best.

23:15.440 --> 23:16.720
If they're not going to commit to you,

23:16.720 --> 23:21.440
then you've had plenty of time for the relationship

23:21.440 --> 23:23.760
to evolve to a point where that would make sense.

23:23.760 --> 23:26.400
You need to cut your ties, cut your losses.

23:26.400 --> 23:28.560
You're a great, great lady.

23:29.120 --> 23:31.200
Especially if you find that out early on,

23:31.200 --> 23:31.920
if you're like,

23:31.920 --> 23:34.080
hey, I'm the type of person that wants to get married

23:34.080 --> 23:35.520
and they're like, oh, I'm not.

23:37.120 --> 23:38.880
That idea of like, I'm going to change them

23:38.880 --> 23:40.320
or I'm going to be the one,

23:40.320 --> 23:41.680
it's going to be different with me.

23:41.680 --> 23:43.680
It's like, well, if there was a possibility of that,

23:43.680 --> 23:45.040
they wouldn't have said anything.

23:45.600 --> 23:46.240
You know what I mean?

23:46.240 --> 23:50.720
It's such a, it's such a cutoff to be like,

23:50.720 --> 23:53.280
oh yeah, I'm not interested in getting married.

23:53.280 --> 23:54.640
Like, okay, that's not going to change

23:54.640 --> 23:56.160
with that person in this relationship

23:56.160 --> 23:58.400
because the best you can hope for is you wear them down

23:58.400 --> 24:00.560
and four years later they're like, okay, I guess so.

24:00.560 --> 24:02.800
I also think that you are going to,

24:04.160 --> 24:07.200
by setting up a question of marriage too early,

24:07.200 --> 24:13.040
I think you can put it into a weird light, right?

24:13.040 --> 24:15.920
Where they start weighing the pros and cons

24:15.920 --> 24:18.800
of you as like a holistic person

24:18.800 --> 24:20.800
rather than just someone they see movies

24:21.360 --> 24:23.120
and eat dinner with sometimes, right?

24:23.120 --> 24:24.240
I mean, if you're, if you're,

24:24.240 --> 24:26.160
if the marriage question is on the table

24:26.160 --> 24:27.360
at the very beginning,

24:28.000 --> 24:32.640
then you lose a lot of the easier stuff to sort of,

24:32.640 --> 24:34.240
to deal with.

24:34.240 --> 24:36.480
You're raising the stakes very high.

24:36.480 --> 24:38.720
They should be so fun in the beginning.

24:38.720 --> 24:39.680
They should just be like,

24:39.680 --> 24:41.440
I'm going to hang out with this cool person

24:41.440 --> 24:43.600
that I like and I'm attracted to.

24:43.600 --> 24:46.480
And it doesn't have to be anything more than that.

24:46.480 --> 24:48.560
And then when it is something more than that,

24:48.560 --> 24:50.640
it's so exciting and so great,

24:50.640 --> 24:52.480
especially when it's mutual and it evolves from there.

24:52.480 --> 24:54.000
If you introduce this question,

24:54.000 --> 24:55.200
you lose out on that like,

24:56.800 --> 24:58.960
that almost Shark Tank-esque,

24:58.960 --> 25:01.040
I could walk, whatever.

25:01.040 --> 25:01.920
You know what I mean?

25:01.920 --> 25:04.160
That's, that is the, that's the true joy.

25:05.120 --> 25:07.600
I forget, I do forget what dating is like though.

25:08.240 --> 25:10.000
And I would wager that my two brothers

25:10.000 --> 25:11.520
are also in the same camp.

25:11.520 --> 25:14.240
I don't remember. No, I'm still dating a woman

25:14.240 --> 25:15.840
and her name is my wife.

25:15.840 --> 25:16.800
Oh, that's beautiful.

25:17.760 --> 25:19.120
I can't remember her real name.

25:19.120 --> 25:20.560
I think it's my wife.

25:20.560 --> 25:22.160
I'm not certain.

25:22.160 --> 25:24.560
Hey guys, hey guys, hey guys, hey guys, hey guys, hey guys.

25:24.560 --> 25:25.040
Hey guys.

25:28.240 --> 25:29.520
You guys remember Borat?

25:32.800 --> 25:33.600
I'm sorry, one more time.

25:33.600 --> 25:34.320
Let me hear it again.

25:34.320 --> 25:39.280
It's awesome if I was melting.

25:41.760 --> 25:43.200
Wizard sleeves.

25:43.200 --> 25:44.880
Getting sucked into a black hole.

25:44.880 --> 25:45.680
Come back, Austin.

25:45.680 --> 25:46.560
Come back to us.

25:46.560 --> 25:47.760
You guys, it's funny.

25:47.760 --> 25:48.960
The longer we do this show,

25:49.600 --> 25:50.960
I feel like we don't,

25:50.960 --> 25:52.960
I don't get better at giving advice,

25:52.960 --> 25:55.840
but I get better at knowing when people are going to tell us

25:55.840 --> 25:57.360
we gave bad advice.

25:57.360 --> 25:58.560
I don't think that was bad advice.

25:59.120 --> 25:59.840
I don't know.

25:59.840 --> 26:01.760
It just seems like people are going to disagree with us.

26:01.760 --> 26:03.360
These things are so complicated.

26:03.360 --> 26:06.400
I know, I know, but it just seems like objectively,

26:06.400 --> 26:09.040
like I see like when I'm at the H-E-B,

26:09.040 --> 26:11.440
buying some chips and guac, which I do daily

26:11.440 --> 26:13.840
because I have to eat an entire tub of guacamole every day

26:13.840 --> 26:14.560
to stay alive.

26:15.600 --> 26:17.840
I see a Cosmo at the fucking register.

26:17.840 --> 26:21.520
It's like how to get your man to commit.

26:21.520 --> 26:23.440
And it's like if you have to fucking like,

26:24.240 --> 26:26.160
if you have to trap somebody or trick somebody,

26:26.160 --> 26:29.360
it just doesn't seem as good as like just finding the right person

26:29.360 --> 26:32.480
and then both of you just very naturally slide into this state.

26:32.480 --> 26:34.400
Like, oh shit, it's you.

26:34.400 --> 26:36.000
Like, hey, it's you.

26:36.000 --> 26:36.640
You're the one.

26:36.640 --> 26:36.960
Yeah.

26:36.960 --> 26:37.680
That's awesome.

26:38.480 --> 26:38.960
I don't know.

26:39.840 --> 26:41.440
I'm not saying it doesn't happen the other way

26:41.440 --> 26:42.400
because I'm sure it does.

26:42.400 --> 26:44.560
Like I'm sure it happens all the goddamn time.

26:44.560 --> 26:48.080
I'm just saying like it doesn't seem like that should be

26:48.080 --> 26:50.800
the default thing that you aim for.

26:50.800 --> 26:51.440
You know what I mean?

26:52.800 --> 26:53.360
You know what I mean?

26:53.360 --> 26:56.000
Kind of put in the cart before the horse, I think a little bit.

26:56.640 --> 26:57.920
How about a Yahoo?

26:57.920 --> 26:58.560
Yeah, please.

26:58.560 --> 27:02.800
Uh, this Yahoo, uh, as soon as my mouse starts working,

27:02.800 --> 27:04.960
this Yahoo was sent in by Ron Conley.

27:04.960 --> 27:05.920
Thanks, Ron.

27:05.920 --> 27:07.520
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

27:07.520 --> 27:08.640
Strong name, huh?

27:08.640 --> 27:10.320
Can we just call him Ronley?

27:10.320 --> 27:12.000
Uh, Ronley, thank you for sending this in.

27:12.000 --> 27:13.760
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

27:13.760 --> 27:14.400
Ah, fuck.

27:15.200 --> 27:19.920
2.7182818, it's a bunch of numbers.

27:19.920 --> 27:20.640
I think it's pi.

27:21.440 --> 27:22.080
That's pi, right?

27:22.080 --> 27:22.560
No.

27:22.560 --> 27:27.360
Uh, thank you, Ron, for sending this in and thank you 2.7, whatever, for asking it.

27:27.360 --> 27:32.160
He asks, God gave Adam nipples, intending him to be the female,

27:32.160 --> 27:34.480
then changed his mind, but left the nipples on?

27:36.080 --> 27:37.920
I don't understand the question.

27:37.920 --> 27:40.640
God gave Adam nipples, intending him to be the female,

27:40.640 --> 27:43.280
then changed his mind, but left the nipples on?

27:43.280 --> 27:44.480
Many atheists used to have-

27:44.480 --> 27:46.400
No, just repeating it doesn't help.

27:46.400 --> 27:50.720
Uh, many atheists used to have fun asking why God gave Adam nipples

27:50.720 --> 27:52.240
so he can help with breastfeeding?

27:53.040 --> 27:55.440
I believe I have finally thought of the answer.

27:55.440 --> 27:59.840
God originally intended Adam to be the female, then quickly changed his mind,

27:59.840 --> 28:04.080
making Eve the female, but God decided to leave the nipples on Adam,

28:04.080 --> 28:06.800
especially since Adam had already named them.

28:07.360 --> 28:08.880
Does this sound about right?

28:08.880 --> 28:10.720
This one's Steve and this one's Jerry.

28:10.720 --> 28:13.760
Uh, replies from religion scholars and others appreciated.

28:13.760 --> 28:15.360
I can't, okay.

28:15.360 --> 28:20.480
So, in this person's mind, God made Adam, said, that's a lady, and then he said,

28:20.480 --> 28:26.000
uh, I feel like the breasts should, like, do more.

28:26.000 --> 28:31.920
So, in fact, God may be infallible, but everybody gets one.

28:31.920 --> 28:32.420
Yeah.

28:32.420 --> 28:34.880
And his was just right at the very beginning.

28:34.880 --> 28:35.520
Right at the top.

28:35.520 --> 28:36.560
Well, I mean, he made the sun.

28:36.560 --> 28:37.600
It's not like he made the sun.

28:37.600 --> 28:40.000
He was like, hmm, maybe-

28:40.000 --> 28:41.360
He put nipples on that, too.

28:41.360 --> 28:44.320
God, he put nipples and said, this is a female.

28:44.320 --> 28:45.360
No, this is a sun.

28:45.360 --> 28:46.160
How could he say-

28:46.160 --> 28:47.680
This is a female.

28:47.680 --> 28:49.040
No, that's the light.

28:49.040 --> 28:50.800
No, no, that's the light and the death.

28:50.800 --> 28:54.720
Remember, children, don't look directly at the sun because you'll see it's nipples,

28:54.720 --> 28:56.080
and that's just sort of rude.

28:56.080 --> 28:56.880
Don't stare at that.

28:57.600 --> 28:58.560
It's not its fault.

28:59.680 --> 29:04.000
I prefer to think of it that God, like, was making Adam, was making a woman,

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
and at the last second went, no way to dude.

29:06.000 --> 29:06.800
Oh, shit.

29:06.800 --> 29:08.160
I'm like, just-

29:08.160 --> 29:08.720
Hold up.

29:08.720 --> 29:09.920
I can't, okay.

29:10.720 --> 29:14.800
Okay, so God can make people, but he can't banish nipples off of them?

29:14.800 --> 29:18.880
Listen, can God create a nipple so big even if he can't break it?

29:20.240 --> 29:24.160
Are you saying that Adam had, like, one huge nipple?

29:25.120 --> 29:26.240
He had to drag it-

29:26.240 --> 29:28.400
Why did you do this to me, God?

29:28.400 --> 29:29.920
Why do you punish me so?

29:29.920 --> 29:32.480
Like a wedding dress, like, trail or something?

29:34.080 --> 29:37.120
First off, we could just go point by point on this question.

29:37.760 --> 29:40.640
First off, how bored are these atheists?

29:40.640 --> 29:41.760
This is what they're doing for fun?

29:41.760 --> 29:43.200
No, I mean, that's a thing, right?

29:43.200 --> 29:45.520
Like, if God exists, why do dudes have nipples?

29:47.440 --> 29:48.880
If God exists, why do dudes have nipples?

29:48.880 --> 29:52.080
I mean, we're all stymied by that question, aren't we?

29:52.080 --> 29:52.640
I mean, but-

29:52.640 --> 29:54.400
Because God's a dirty bird.

29:54.400 --> 29:55.280
I mean, they're-

29:55.280 --> 29:56.640
You know why I think you made them?

29:57.440 --> 29:58.400
Are you ready for this?

29:58.400 --> 30:00.080
I'll crack this shit wide open.

30:00.080 --> 30:01.920
National Treasure, Jesus edition.

30:03.840 --> 30:06.960
It's because our chest would look super crazy if we didn't have them on there.

30:06.960 --> 30:07.680
Think about that.

30:08.480 --> 30:10.880
Think about aesthetically, it's like,

30:10.880 --> 30:14.640
if dudes, it was just like, top to bottom, all right?

30:14.640 --> 30:15.600
Hair, cool.

30:15.600 --> 30:17.280
Eyes, it can be different colors.

30:17.280 --> 30:18.560
Sometimes they're really pretty.

30:19.360 --> 30:21.440
A nose, yeah, you need that for smelling.

30:21.440 --> 30:24.240
A mouth, sure, you need somewhere for the sounds to come out.

30:24.240 --> 30:28.640
And then like, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, dick.

30:33.280 --> 30:33.680
Right?

30:33.680 --> 30:35.360
Like, if we're still looking at the center pillar,

30:35.360 --> 30:39.280
if we're looking at the chakras, hair, eyes, nose, mouth.

30:39.280 --> 30:41.120
Yep, check, love all those.

30:41.120 --> 30:43.040
Lots of variation, lots of differences.

30:43.040 --> 30:44.880
And then nothing.

30:46.080 --> 30:47.360
It is, that's a great point.

30:47.360 --> 30:51.760
Fucking 20 miles of flesh, and then stuff starts happening again.

30:51.760 --> 30:52.720
If God built us-

30:52.720 --> 30:54.080
It's like the movie AI.

30:54.080 --> 30:58.960
It's like a really strong beginning, and the ending is super exciting.

30:58.960 --> 31:00.240
And then like, what happened in the middle?

31:00.240 --> 31:02.400
Like, Jude Law took him to a fucking robot circus,

31:02.400 --> 31:04.800
and he got lost and destroyed New York?

31:04.800 --> 31:06.240
Like, who gives a fuck?

31:06.240 --> 31:12.880
If God did build us top to bottom, he did get like, I think he got burnt out.

31:12.880 --> 31:13.040
Yeah.

31:13.040 --> 31:13.840
Like, oh man.

31:13.840 --> 31:15.360
Well, I have to imagine he didn't-

31:15.360 --> 31:17.280
I can't keep putting that much detail into things.

31:17.280 --> 31:20.960
Right, he did it like the old Lego toys, you know, old toys where he said like,

31:20.960 --> 31:22.560
okay, we've got a stock body,

31:23.200 --> 31:26.240
and then we can just put different heads on it in different outfits,

31:26.240 --> 31:27.520
and that will be the different people.

31:27.520 --> 31:28.560
That's true.

31:28.560 --> 31:29.920
That's a good point, Travis.

31:29.920 --> 31:35.520
Like, he just had one idea for bodies, and he's like, I don't know, maybe just reuse that.

31:35.520 --> 31:36.160
Just keep using it.

31:36.160 --> 31:37.120
Yeah, over and over again.

31:37.120 --> 31:38.720
Because, yeah, guys.

31:38.720 --> 31:39.840
Yeah, the two of you.

31:39.840 --> 31:43.120
Because every dude's body looks exactly the same.

31:43.120 --> 31:45.760
That's why when you see like, me and Channing Tatum,

31:45.760 --> 31:50.720
if we're wearing full head masks, you're like, God, that one's Griffin?

31:50.720 --> 31:51.920
Oh no, that one's Channing.

31:51.920 --> 31:52.160
Fuck.

31:53.120 --> 31:54.960
No, but I mean, it's not-

31:54.960 --> 31:59.680
Okay, fair, but if I were to cut off Channing Tatum's head, I'd go to jail.

31:59.680 --> 32:03.840
But if I did cut off Channing Tatum's head, and I showed you Channing Tatum's bottom,

32:03.840 --> 32:07.360
you wouldn't be able to tell if that was Channing Tatum or Kevin Sorbo.

32:07.360 --> 32:08.720
I actually carved-

32:08.720 --> 32:11.680
Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

32:11.680 --> 32:16.720
Those are your two go-to attractive in-shape dudes.

32:16.720 --> 32:19.280
Channing Tatum and Kevin Sorbo.

32:19.280 --> 32:21.440
Kevin Sorbo's Hercules, okay?

32:21.440 --> 32:24.640
But I can't tell the difference between them physically.

32:24.640 --> 32:27.600
Also, he was Hercules in 1981.

32:27.600 --> 32:33.120
He's not Hercules forever because he's not actually Hercules.

32:34.080 --> 32:36.080
Is that Kevin Sorbo or is that Channing Tatum?

32:36.080 --> 32:36.400
I don't know.

32:36.400 --> 32:37.680
I'll have to wait till they turn around.

32:37.680 --> 32:38.880
I cannot see their face.

32:38.880 --> 32:39.680
I actually-

32:40.640 --> 32:43.840
I carved my initials into Channing Tatum's ass so I could tell them apart.

32:43.840 --> 32:44.640
It's the only way.

32:46.160 --> 32:49.280
I clearly meant Kevin Sorbo classic.

32:49.280 --> 32:49.840
Oh, okay.

32:49.840 --> 32:51.040
I wasn't implying-

32:51.040 --> 32:52.240
Not new Sorbo.

32:52.240 --> 32:53.280
Not new Sorbo.

32:54.080 --> 32:55.520
Not Crystal Sorbo.

32:55.520 --> 32:58.400
Crystal Sorbo classic Kevin Sorbo.

32:58.960 --> 33:00.240
The original formulation.

33:00.240 --> 33:00.960
Oh, man.

33:01.680 --> 33:02.960
When he was Hercules.

33:02.960 --> 33:14.720
Let's get the money's over here.

33:14.720 --> 33:18.320

And we will sue you so hard.

33:32.000 --> 33:32.880
Take you down.

33:32.880 --> 33:36.880
The good thing about that is that they offer a support team 24-7.

33:36.880 --> 33:39.200
Do they offer legal support because we sued you?

33:39.200 --> 33:40.160
I don't think so.

33:41.120 --> 33:42.400
They have new designs.

33:42.400 --> 33:43.680
It's got new features.

33:43.680 --> 33:49.360
And it's just eight bucks a month with a free domain name if you sign up for a year.

33:49.360 --> 33:55.520

33:55.520 --> 33:56.000
phones.

33:56.000 --> 33:56.560
So that's kind of nice.

33:56.560 --> 33:59.440

34:06.720 --> 34:10.000
The dot com bubble is just expanding now and it will never burst.

34:10.000 --> 34:11.840
It's never bursted before either.

34:11.840 --> 34:12.880
It's an infinite bubble.

34:12.880 --> 34:14.000
Invest all your money.

34:14.000 --> 34:14.500
Yeah.

34:15.200 --> 34:17.600
I have so much money in pets.com, guys.

34:17.600 --> 34:20.160
And that is how I'm sending my kids to college.

34:20.960 --> 34:24.000

Yeah.

34:44.400 --> 34:45.360

34:45.360 --> 34:46.160
I want to see it.

34:46.160 --> 34:47.440
Let us see your website.

34:47.440 --> 34:50.400
I want to see the website you made with that and make it about us.

34:51.040 --> 34:54.800
Yeah, because I don't actually read anything that's not about me, so that would be very

34:54.800 --> 34:55.300
helpful.

34:56.000 --> 35:00.160
Guys, I just tore January off of my Dilbert calendar.

35:01.280 --> 35:10.240
The calendar is from 1997, so the dates don't exactly match up, but you get a general idea.

35:10.960 --> 35:13.600
I legit forgot that Valentine's Day is coming up.

35:14.560 --> 35:15.840
Oh, shit.

35:15.840 --> 35:16.880
It'll sneak up on you.

35:16.880 --> 35:17.680
You got to be careful.

35:19.440 --> 35:20.640
Griffin, I'm in a panic now.

35:20.640 --> 35:21.040
Yeah.

35:21.040 --> 35:21.920
I don't know what I'm going to do.

35:21.920 --> 35:22.960
Well, let me tell you what to do.

35:23.600 --> 35:24.240
Okay.

35:24.240 --> 35:24.880
Tell me exactly what to do.

35:24.880 --> 35:33.280
You can avoid forgetting, letting Valentine's Day slip your dome by going to proflowers.com.

35:33.280 --> 35:39.520
It's a flowers vendor website on internet that you can use to get the flowers, and then

35:39.520 --> 35:42.560
you don't have to go to the store and smell them and it sets off your allergies.

35:42.560 --> 35:45.840
You get them on internet, and then you get it delivered to your house.

35:45.840 --> 35:49.680
Beautiful blooms in all sorts of different colors.

35:49.680 --> 35:51.280
We have beautiful blooms here.

35:52.720 --> 35:54.720
I'm talking about beautiful blooms.

35:54.720 --> 35:59.520
Let me just hit you with some of the stuff that they have on proflowers.com.

36:00.240 --> 36:02.960
Beautiful blooms, check, covered that.

36:02.960 --> 36:09.440
You can get 100 blooms of love with a free glass vase for just $19.99.

36:09.440 --> 36:10.880
I don't know if you guys know this.

36:10.880 --> 36:15.920
That's crazy not expensive compared to other flowers.

36:16.480 --> 36:17.680
That's not enough for me.

36:17.680 --> 36:18.560
I want to upgrade.

36:18.560 --> 36:21.600
I want to add gourmet chocolates and a teddy bear.

36:22.480 --> 36:23.680
How much is that going to cost?

36:23.680 --> 36:28.080
That's another $9.99 American US dollars.

36:28.080 --> 36:29.280
Oh my God.

36:29.280 --> 36:30.720
That's such a good fucking deal.

36:30.720 --> 36:34.560
That's a crazy thing to get for that much money.

36:34.560 --> 36:41.040
That's insane, and you can get it exclusively through us on us by using the code mybrother.

36:41.040 --> 36:42.000
Now here's how you do it though.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.040
You go to proflowers.com.

36:43.040 --> 36:45.680
You click on there's a blue microphone, okay?

36:45.680 --> 36:48.160
It's in the top right corner, and you type in my brother.

36:48.160 --> 36:49.760
You can just use it as a coupon code.

36:49.760 --> 36:51.280
You go to proflowers.com.

36:51.280 --> 36:54.480
You click on the blue microphone, and you type in my brother.

36:54.480 --> 36:59.200
And this is going to be like a crazy, crazy deal, and you'll have it sorted.

36:59.200 --> 37:01.520
Like that's Valentine's Day, sorted, done.

37:01.520 --> 37:07.200
We got sent some flowers from proflowers.com so we could see them in our home.

37:07.200 --> 37:08.080
Which was a fun thing.

37:08.080 --> 37:09.520
Because they're according to us.

37:09.520 --> 37:12.640
Which was a fun thing to explain to my wife.

37:13.440 --> 37:16.080
I don't know about you, how that situation went down with your respect.

37:16.080 --> 37:17.120
Oh, you got me flowers.

37:17.120 --> 37:18.880
Yeah, sure, yeah, sort of.

37:18.880 --> 37:20.800
Yeah, yeah, of course I did, honey.

37:20.800 --> 37:21.680
I love you.

37:21.680 --> 37:24.720
Could you send me a picture of them though so I could see what they look like?

37:26.080 --> 37:29.920
Yeah, they are gorgeous, and they are sitting in our home right now, and it's really nice.

37:29.920 --> 37:34.320
It's a nice vase, the flowers came super fresh, and it's in a box.

37:34.320 --> 37:38.400
It's insane that this technology exists, but you take them out of the box and they look amazing.

37:38.960 --> 37:40.640
And you can get that right now.

37:40.640 --> 37:44.080
Go to proflowers.com, click on the blue microphone, and in the top right corner,

37:44.080 --> 37:45.760
type in my brother, all one word.

37:45.760 --> 37:48.400
It's a microphone like a podcast, because that's how you remember.

37:48.400 --> 37:49.440
That's a mnemonic device.

37:49.440 --> 37:51.760
Yeah, and do it soon.

37:52.480 --> 37:53.600
So like right now.

37:53.600 --> 37:55.120
Yeah, because that won't last forever.

37:55.760 --> 37:56.720
Yeah, oh no.

37:56.720 --> 38:00.160
Unlike love, this order won't last forever.

38:01.600 --> 38:02.960
You know who will live forever?

38:02.960 --> 38:03.680
Who?

38:03.680 --> 38:04.400
Yoshi.

38:04.400 --> 38:05.120
It's from Mario?

38:05.920 --> 38:06.800
No, from Brian.

38:07.840 --> 38:10.080
Brian says, happy moving in together today.

38:10.080 --> 38:12.960
Thanks for being the best girlfriend ever.

38:13.760 --> 38:15.600
Whoa, really throwing down the gauntlet.

38:15.600 --> 38:18.960
If, against all odds, you actually do become a ghost before I do,

38:18.960 --> 38:21.120
please don't actually haunt my penis.

38:21.120 --> 38:23.840
Yeah, you didn't finish reading that sentence before you said it out loud, did you?

38:23.840 --> 38:28.240
No, I hope that's a conversation that Brian and Yoshi have had before,

38:28.240 --> 38:31.760
and not new information that Brian is dropping on Yoshi.

38:31.760 --> 38:35.200
We've got a new quiz game we're playing in this section called

38:35.200 --> 38:37.600
In Joke or Terrifying Revelation.

38:39.280 --> 38:40.960
Let's hope that's an in joke.

38:41.760 --> 38:45.280
Also, I want the brothers to say they love you one after another,

38:45.280 --> 38:46.960
because you're so obviously awesome.

38:46.960 --> 38:47.360
You don't-

38:48.160 --> 38:50.480
I can't just throw my heart around you.

38:50.480 --> 38:51.040
No, you know what?

38:51.040 --> 38:55.600
I'm going to say, Yoshi, I love you for putting up with Brian and all of his pee pee talk.

38:55.600 --> 39:02.560
And I can say, I love Yoshi, and then maybe I'm talking about this person,

39:02.560 --> 39:06.240
maybe I'm just talking about the fact that Yoshi is my favorite character from Super Smash Brothers.

39:07.200 --> 39:07.680
Fair enough.

39:09.200 --> 39:12.640
Does that awesome egg roll, and it's really hard to hit him, so.

39:12.640 --> 39:13.200
I love you.

39:13.200 --> 39:14.240
I love egg rolls.

39:14.240 --> 39:14.740
Yeah, me too.

39:15.520 --> 39:17.680
So happy, have a good one, guys.

39:17.680 --> 39:19.120
Enjoy that journey together.

39:19.120 --> 39:24.160
Uh, be patient, and be understanding, and give of yourself, and it'll all work out fine.

39:24.160 --> 39:24.720
Wow, shit.

39:25.520 --> 39:26.160
Deep.

39:26.160 --> 39:28.960
Here's another message for Scott Foreman Murray,

39:29.840 --> 39:35.680
who is 30 years old, American, in the American keeping of time.

39:36.320 --> 39:38.560
This message is from Lindsay, who says,

39:39.600 --> 39:41.600
Happy birthday, Victor.

39:41.600 --> 39:47.840
Now, my memory is pretty short, but it's not so short that I forget that this dude's ass name is Scott.

39:47.840 --> 39:49.120
What are you doing, Lindsay?

39:49.120 --> 39:50.640
What kind of scam are you running?

39:50.640 --> 39:52.800
Uh, happy birthday, Victor Scott.

39:52.800 --> 39:57.760
You are the best, funniest, smartest person I know, and my favorite human in the world.

39:57.760 --> 40:01.680
There's no one I'd rather spend the afternoon with, let alone the rest of my life.

40:01.680 --> 40:06.160
Thanks for marrying me this year, and here's to another seven or so decades full of nonsense,

40:06.160 --> 40:12.560
sandwiches, squeezels, and car rides, long car rides, listening to my bim bam as us.

40:12.560 --> 40:19.360
Uh, I love that this person has put a fairly fine point on when they're going to terminate.

40:20.240 --> 40:22.400
Yeah, 70 or so.

40:22.400 --> 40:27.280
Yeah, I mean, if we can get 70 out of this thing, fucking great.

40:28.800 --> 40:29.280
We'll beat the average.

40:29.280 --> 40:30.000
What's your name again?

40:31.200 --> 40:31.680
Victor?

40:32.400 --> 40:33.600
Victor Scott.

40:33.600 --> 40:34.800
Oh no, this doesn't-

40:34.800 --> 40:37.440
Guys, when it turns out that Travis just put in the wrong message there,

40:37.440 --> 40:40.080
be sure to email us so we can fix it next week.

40:40.080 --> 40:44.400
I simply did not.

40:44.400 --> 40:49.200
I am so proud to be an American and to be hosting Throwing Shade with you.

40:49.200 --> 40:53.200
I am proud to have really deep brown eyes.

40:53.200 --> 40:58.240
Well, this is actually supposed to be, you know, this is supposed to be a thing so that

40:58.240 --> 40:59.040
people listen to our show.

40:59.040 --> 41:02.240
I've just been so busy this week, but I'm very happy to be here.

41:02.240 --> 41:03.680
The podcast is called-

41:03.680 --> 41:04.640
It's called Throwing Shade.

41:04.640 --> 41:05.520
You're the co-host, yeah.

41:05.520 --> 41:06.960
So, uh, Throwing Shade, we talk about-

41:06.960 --> 41:09.120
You're the gay co-host, I'm the female co-host.

41:09.120 --> 41:09.760
I always forget.

41:09.760 --> 41:14.320
We're friends in real life, kind of, and we talk about lady and gay issues.

41:14.320 --> 41:14.560
Yeah.

41:14.560 --> 41:18.480
And we talk about them in a way that is really disrespectful.

41:18.480 --> 41:18.800
Yeah.

41:18.800 --> 41:20.880
If you love the world and hate yourself-

41:20.880 --> 41:22.320
Please listen to Throwing Shade.

41:22.320 --> 41:22.820
Yeah.

41:25.440 --> 41:29.600
I've had a Twitter account for a couple of years, but I've never really used it.

41:29.600 --> 41:33.040
A year ago, I was hired by a company with roots in the video game industry.

41:33.040 --> 41:34.160
I'm an artist.

41:34.160 --> 41:37.840
And a well-known company began following my little personal Twitter account, which led

41:37.840 --> 41:41.840
to several miscellaneous followers, ranging from a couple YouTube stars to minor league

41:41.840 --> 41:42.640
music producers.

41:42.640 --> 41:47.040
Now, I feel obligated to tweet in an attempt to build a personal brand.

41:47.680 --> 41:48.160
But what?

41:49.040 --> 41:52.400
I don't want to sound ditzy or boring, but I don't know how to form a decent thought

41:52.400 --> 41:54.320
around 140 character restriction.

41:54.320 --> 41:55.120
Help me, brothers.

41:56.240 --> 41:57.200
How do I tweet?

41:58.320 --> 41:59.520
That's from tongue-tied Twitter.

42:02.160 --> 42:05.360
Now, you're both verified Twitter account holders, correct?

42:05.360 --> 42:08.320
And listen, people, we fucking get it, right?

42:08.320 --> 42:09.360
Justin and I are verified.

42:09.360 --> 42:10.400
Travis isn't.

42:10.400 --> 42:11.360
Ha ha ha.

42:11.360 --> 42:14.640
It's a great joke that Travis isn't verified.

42:14.640 --> 42:17.360
But it's not because Travis is worse than us.

42:18.080 --> 42:19.760
It's not that he's like the worst brother.

42:19.760 --> 42:20.240
It's not?

42:20.240 --> 42:20.960
No, Trav-

42:20.960 --> 42:21.680
No, Travy.

42:22.480 --> 42:22.960
Everybody-

42:22.960 --> 42:24.400
That's what people seem to imply.

42:24.960 --> 42:26.560
Well, they can back the hell off.

42:27.200 --> 42:29.920
It's just that they've implied such mean things.

42:30.560 --> 42:33.760
We're allowed to goof on each other, but if anybody goofs on either two of you, I'm

42:33.760 --> 42:34.640
taking them.

42:34.640 --> 42:36.400
Downtown to Punch Town.

42:37.680 --> 42:38.240
The problem is-

42:38.240 --> 42:42.720
Which is this gym that I go to, and then I will make them watch me lift weights, and

42:42.720 --> 42:43.600
then they'll be intimidated.

42:43.600 --> 42:45.520
Trace up, and then we'll go around and around.

42:45.520 --> 42:48.720
Travis is incapable of proving that he is who he is.

42:48.720 --> 42:49.440
That's a problem.

42:50.080 --> 42:52.000
Justin and me, we can do it.

42:52.000 --> 42:54.320
Travis has a much, much harder time.

42:55.040 --> 42:58.080
That's because Travis's tweet material is so erratic.

42:58.800 --> 43:00.080
You can't fucking pin him down.

43:00.080 --> 43:00.480
He tweets-

43:00.480 --> 43:01.200
And erotic.

43:01.200 --> 43:02.400
It's erratic, erotic.

43:02.400 --> 43:04.240
He tweets in a serpentine pattern.

43:04.240 --> 43:05.520
You can't get a beat on his ass.

43:07.280 --> 43:09.200
Me, I'm pretty much always just talking-

43:09.200 --> 43:13.760
Asking people for healthy recipes and complaining about video games.

43:13.760 --> 43:15.520
That's pretty much my entire Twitter.

43:17.280 --> 43:18.080
I mean, here's the thing.

43:18.080 --> 43:21.280
If we give you advice on your own personal brand, then it's just gonna come from our

43:21.280 --> 43:27.360
personal brands, and I do not need any more competition in my space, which is pseudo-ironic,

43:27.360 --> 43:30.160
all lowercase tweets about the things that I did today.

43:30.160 --> 43:32.080
Uh, here's, here's one thing.

43:32.080 --> 43:36.960
One actual Twitter tip that I can give you is, uh, it's a really good time to tweet

43:36.960 --> 43:40.560
when you're watching something on TV that a lot of people are watching.

43:40.560 --> 43:42.080
Dude, I got all my followers.

43:42.080 --> 43:44.560
That's when you can really harness the zeitgeist.

43:44.560 --> 43:46.080
If you want to build a brand, that's when you do it.

43:46.080 --> 43:46.560
This is what you do.

43:46.560 --> 43:47.120
This is what you do.

43:47.120 --> 43:49.920
Throw a party during, like, the Oscars.

43:49.920 --> 43:50.880
Throw an Oscars party.

43:51.520 --> 43:54.800
Get, like, 12 of your super funny friends in the same room.

43:54.800 --> 43:59.200
Get them all drunk, and then one of them says something funny, fucking twerking.

43:59.200 --> 44:00.880
If it's funny, fucking tweet it.

44:00.880 --> 44:01.920
That's yours now.

44:01.920 --> 44:02.800
That's your brand.

44:02.800 --> 44:03.600
They don't have to know.

44:03.600 --> 44:06.960
That's like a billi- or you could do, like, you can write in parentheses, like,

44:06.960 --> 44:09.520
H slash T, Joey Bag of Donuts.

44:09.520 --> 44:12.320
Cause then, then you're giving a hat tip to your friend Joey Bag of Donuts.

44:13.200 --> 44:13.920
That's what that means.

44:13.920 --> 44:17.360
But don't include his Twitter account name, or else people will just, like, fucking flock

44:17.360 --> 44:17.600
there.

44:17.600 --> 44:19.600
You don't want to bleed your followers.

44:19.600 --> 44:21.360
It's all about SEO optimization.

44:22.080 --> 44:24.400
Now, SEO does stand for search engine optimization.

44:24.400 --> 44:26.240
You have to optimize your optimization.

44:26.240 --> 44:28.000
Listen, there's fucking layers to this thing.

44:28.000 --> 44:29.280
It's Dante's Inferno.

44:29.280 --> 44:32.480
Don't be afraid to ask for a retweet.

44:32.480 --> 44:36.560
When I was watching the State of the Union, I said, uh, I hope the commander-in-chief

44:36.560 --> 44:42.320
has some Purell, because, uh, cold and flu season doesn't care what you're the president

44:42.320 --> 44:42.480
of.

44:42.480 --> 44:47.440
And then, later in the tweet, this is where a lot of people stumble, I used the hashtag

44:47.440 --> 44:49.200
Purell please retweet this.

44:49.920 --> 44:53.920
And then, the next day, okay, so they sort of missed the zeitgeist.

44:53.920 --> 44:55.360
Kind of fell off it a bit.

44:55.360 --> 44:56.960
Purell did retweet me.

44:56.960 --> 44:58.160
So, I have that.

44:58.160 --> 45:00.960
I have that in my sort of wheelhouse now.

45:00.960 --> 45:04.240
When I'm doing a bio, I say, once retweeted by Purell.

45:05.440 --> 45:06.400
And that's pretty exciting.

45:06.400 --> 45:08.240
Oh, the bio is so fucking important.

45:08.240 --> 45:09.040
Can we touch on that?

45:09.040 --> 45:13.680
You have to throw as many fucking buzzwords in there as you possibly can, including the

45:13.680 --> 45:14.480
word buzzword.

45:15.280 --> 45:16.240
Buzzword ninja.

45:16.800 --> 45:17.680
Social guru.

45:20.560 --> 45:23.360
Master of tweet karate.

45:23.360 --> 45:31.760
I want you guys to know, I, and probably all of our listeners, cannot tell if this is all

45:31.760 --> 45:32.080
bullshit.

45:32.080 --> 45:33.280
Forward thinker.

45:33.280 --> 45:34.560
Think tank thinker.

45:34.560 --> 45:35.360
Think, think, think.

45:36.080 --> 45:36.720
Good thinks.

45:36.720 --> 45:38.320
This all sounds pretty good to me.

45:38.320 --> 45:39.040
This sounds like how I do Twitter so far.

45:39.040 --> 45:40.880
Learning optimization guru.

45:44.240 --> 45:45.440
Are you reading my bio?

45:46.160 --> 45:49.040
Social coordinator and master of tweet foo.

45:51.840 --> 45:52.400
Yes.

45:52.400 --> 45:55.840
Do you guys ever see somebody's bio think, God's a good bio.

45:55.840 --> 45:56.720
I wish I thought of that.

45:57.600 --> 46:02.400
I honestly think I have the best Twitter bio on the entire internet.

46:02.400 --> 46:06.240
So, I haven't touched it since day one and I will never touch it.

46:06.960 --> 46:07.920
Can you tell us what it is?

46:09.920 --> 46:10.880
I cannot.

46:10.880 --> 46:12.080
You gotta go find out for yourself.

46:12.080 --> 46:12.880
All right, great.

46:12.880 --> 46:14.480
This is his fucking personal brand.

46:14.480 --> 46:16.320
Travis is all about establishing a mystery.

46:16.320 --> 46:18.960
That's why that motherfucker is not verified.

46:18.960 --> 46:20.160
They send him emails all the time.

46:20.160 --> 46:22.480
Like, Travis, do you want us to verify you?

46:22.480 --> 46:26.960
He says, if you can find me, try and just try and find me.

46:26.960 --> 46:27.360
You can.

46:28.080 --> 46:30.240
Like our friend Evan Minsker, right?

46:30.240 --> 46:31.120
His background.

46:31.120 --> 46:32.560
I think backgrounds are key too.

46:32.560 --> 46:34.560
That's your chance to sort of have fun.

46:35.120 --> 46:38.720
His looks like an image from an old cookbook from the 70s.

46:38.720 --> 46:41.040
And when I saw it, I thought, God, that's so cool.

46:41.040 --> 46:42.400
I wish that was my background.

46:43.600 --> 46:45.360
And now he's got that going for him.

46:45.360 --> 46:46.320
He doesn't even have to worry about it.

46:46.320 --> 46:48.240
And then his Twitter icon attacks on Jim Duggan.

46:48.240 --> 46:48.720
Yeah.

46:48.720 --> 46:49.680
He's like crushing it.

46:49.680 --> 46:51.840
It's a destination Twitter account.

46:51.840 --> 46:53.920
Go spend some time on there.

46:53.920 --> 46:55.600
He's a real smart fella.

46:55.600 --> 46:56.160
That's the thing.

46:57.040 --> 46:59.440
Your Twitter account has to feel like an event.

46:59.440 --> 47:01.520
When somebody walks in, they gotta think, like, whoa,

47:01.520 --> 47:04.400
I am just in time for this party because it is just getting started.

47:05.120 --> 47:06.000
And let me throw this out.

47:06.000 --> 47:07.280
Something for everyone.

47:07.280 --> 47:10.240
It's always great to throw like a, hey, do you remember this?

47:10.240 --> 47:14.160
And then like post a YouTube clip from like Rocko's Modern Life.

47:14.160 --> 47:19.360
And then not only did you not just come up with any actual original content,

47:19.360 --> 47:24.000
but you get to bask in all the glow of it as people go, thank you.

47:24.000 --> 47:24.400
Thank you.

47:24.400 --> 47:26.880
I think Travis just invented BuzzFeed.

47:30.080 --> 47:30.800
Here's the thing, though.

47:30.800 --> 47:33.200
When you are putting up quotes from Rocko's Modern Life,

47:33.200 --> 47:35.760
make sure you source them to Morgan Freeman.

47:35.760 --> 47:37.360
Because that's going to go viral.

47:38.080 --> 47:38.960
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

47:39.760 --> 47:40.160
Please.

47:41.440 --> 47:43.440
This Yahoo was sent in by Steven Schaus.

47:43.440 --> 47:44.000
Thanks, Steven.

47:44.000 --> 47:46.800
It's by Yahoo Answers user Lauren Dwan, who asks,

47:46.800 --> 47:49.360
what's the cheapest horse?

47:50.800 --> 47:52.960
And then additional info, I want a horse.

47:55.520 --> 47:57.840
You want to go with the cheapest horse?

47:57.840 --> 48:00.080
Well, guys, what's the cheapest horse?

48:00.800 --> 48:02.880
The problem is, is you get what you pay for.

48:02.880 --> 48:06.320
You go with those cut rate, you know, thrift store horses.

48:06.320 --> 48:08.720
It's only going to last you like two or three years

48:08.720 --> 48:10.880
before the knees and elbows start to wear out.

48:10.880 --> 48:13.760
You get a Shetland, like it's only going to put you back a couple grand,

48:13.760 --> 48:16.640
but like you're not going to feel the fucking wind in your hair

48:16.640 --> 48:18.560
that you would get from a premium horse.

48:21.120 --> 48:26.400
It's just like, I think when you buy a horse,

48:27.120 --> 48:32.400
it's sort of like buying a car, maybe.

48:32.400 --> 48:34.240
So you could buy a shitty car, sure.

48:34.240 --> 48:38.640
You're going to pay like a shit ton in terms of like upkeep and insurance.

48:38.640 --> 48:42.400
Like I imagine horse fees are like astronomical,

48:42.400 --> 48:43.760
and that's why nobody fucking has it.

48:43.760 --> 48:45.840
Let me throw out the differences.

48:45.840 --> 48:47.680
When you buy a shitty cheap car,

48:48.640 --> 48:53.120
you don't have to feel any kind of emotions as it falls apart

48:54.560 --> 48:57.600
as opposed to buying a shitty living being

48:58.320 --> 49:00.480
and then going, I don't feel like feeding it.

49:00.480 --> 49:01.920
I've done a little research.

49:01.920 --> 49:02.160
Okay.

49:03.120 --> 49:03.760
Here's the thing.

49:04.960 --> 49:06.080
They're free horses.

49:06.080 --> 49:07.040
What the fuck?

49:07.040 --> 49:08.320
What the fuck?

49:08.320 --> 49:08.560
What?

49:09.120 --> 49:09.440
What?

49:09.440 --> 49:12.800
I'm looking right now, I'm looking at equine.com.

49:12.800 --> 49:13.280
Okay.

49:13.280 --> 49:15.280
And I'm looking at free horses.

49:15.280 --> 49:19.440
This is a section that is just free horses to a good home.

49:19.440 --> 49:19.680
Okay.

49:19.680 --> 49:22.480
Can I just say then fuck all that other shit I just said?

49:23.040 --> 49:26.320
Cause then you can just, you can just get a burner.

49:26.320 --> 49:26.960
You know what I mean?

49:29.520 --> 49:31.200
I want to ride an untraceable horse.

49:31.200 --> 49:32.480
I want to ride a horse.

49:32.480 --> 49:34.560
I don't know if I'm going to be able to pay 300 bucks a month

49:34.560 --> 49:36.560
to just like fucking stable this bad boy.

49:36.560 --> 49:40.960
I'm going to get a burner, take him out for the weekend and yeah.

49:40.960 --> 49:41.120
Yeah.

49:41.120 --> 49:41.520
Come on.

49:41.520 --> 49:42.080
Come this way.

49:42.080 --> 49:42.640
Come this way.

49:43.200 --> 49:43.520
Bye.

49:44.480 --> 49:45.680
That horse will outrun you.

49:45.680 --> 49:46.960
Good luck getting away from that horse.

49:46.960 --> 49:48.960
But you can just leave them in a field somewhere.

49:48.960 --> 49:51.520
And then he'll, you know, horses lived for a long time

49:51.520 --> 49:54.640
before we like gave them oats and shelter and shit.

49:54.640 --> 49:55.840
They're very resourceful.

49:55.840 --> 49:56.800
They're horseful.

49:57.600 --> 49:58.320
They're going to be fine.

49:58.320 --> 49:59.440
They're going to be just fine.

49:59.440 --> 50:02.000
Get yourself a burner or a few.

50:03.440 --> 50:05.760
I'm looking at one listing that caught my eye.

50:05.760 --> 50:06.720
This is Smokey.

50:07.280 --> 50:10.880
She's a sweet senior pony looking for a retirement home.

50:10.880 --> 50:11.760
And you know what?

50:11.760 --> 50:15.440
I appreciate the coded language, but I know what you're saying here

50:15.440 --> 50:17.360
and it's that you don't want to deal with her death.

50:17.360 --> 50:17.840
Can you even-

50:17.840 --> 50:21.280
You want me to be the one who's carrying that emotional burden?

50:21.280 --> 50:22.080
No, thank you.

50:22.080 --> 50:23.600
Can you have a senior pony?

50:23.600 --> 50:25.360
Isn't a pony a young horse?

50:26.400 --> 50:27.360
No, no.

50:27.360 --> 50:29.360
We've been blasted for that before.

50:29.360 --> 50:29.600
Yeah.

50:29.600 --> 50:32.080
A pony is like a completely different thing.

50:32.080 --> 50:32.480
Did we get-

50:32.480 --> 50:34.240
Shetland pony is not a tiny horse.

50:34.240 --> 50:36.160
I mean, it is a tiny horse.

50:36.160 --> 50:39.200
I mean, it is a tiny horse, but it will not eventually become a horse.

50:41.440 --> 50:42.240
Just add water.

50:42.240 --> 50:43.120
Do not feed after midnight.

50:43.120 --> 50:43.920
Hold on.

50:43.920 --> 50:50.400
Have I been getting this wrong for a quarter of a century?

50:52.160 --> 50:53.600
Have I really been getting this wrong?

50:53.600 --> 50:55.840
I thought it was like when you call a goat a kid,

50:55.840 --> 50:57.840
because when it's a baby or a-

50:57.840 --> 50:58.880
No, it's a foal.

50:58.880 --> 51:00.720
A foal is a-

51:00.720 --> 51:02.720
And then a kangaroo has a joey, right?

51:02.720 --> 51:03.680
Uh-huh.

51:03.680 --> 51:04.480
And then there's a murder-

51:04.480 --> 51:05.040
A Joey Lawrence.

51:05.040 --> 51:08.320
A murder of crows, if it's a bunch of baby crows.

51:08.320 --> 51:12.080
A pony is not a baby horse?

51:12.080 --> 51:13.360
Are you fucking kidding me?

51:13.920 --> 51:15.760
No, this is the-

51:16.720 --> 51:18.640
Sorry, this is the way it is.

51:19.600 --> 51:20.880
I need to stop belaboring this.

51:20.880 --> 51:22.000
I need to just play it off like,

51:22.000 --> 51:23.920
I got you guys, goofs.

51:23.920 --> 51:24.880
Good jokes.

51:24.880 --> 51:26.480
This is like my character I do on the show.

51:26.480 --> 51:29.600
He's a guy who doesn't know just like basic, simple, first grade shit.

51:29.600 --> 51:32.400
I'm sorry.

51:32.400 --> 51:34.880
I'm still trying to compartmentalize the knowledge

51:34.880 --> 51:35.840
that I could just have a horse.

51:35.840 --> 51:36.800
Just go get a horse, sure.

51:37.360 --> 51:40.240
Just go pick up a horse that lives at my house.

51:40.240 --> 51:40.480
Yeah.

51:41.680 --> 51:44.720
What defines a good home in that respect?

51:44.720 --> 51:46.160
Because I would love the horse.

51:46.160 --> 51:46.800
Yeah, sure.

51:46.800 --> 51:48.960
And it would stand in my tiny backyard

51:48.960 --> 51:50.640
and my dog would probably bark at it.

51:50.640 --> 51:51.120
Does that work?

51:51.120 --> 51:53.760
You would be the fagan of horses

51:53.760 --> 51:56.560
in that you wouldn't be able to take especially good care of the horse,

51:56.560 --> 51:59.120
but you would create like a loving environment and atmosphere

51:59.120 --> 52:00.960
all so you would teach the horse to steal.

52:03.200 --> 52:04.800
Probably a good way of doing this

52:04.800 --> 52:08.880
is to go to someone's home when they're not there

52:09.520 --> 52:13.040
and then damage all their belongings

52:13.040 --> 52:15.920
and then put their horse into the house.

52:16.640 --> 52:18.240
And then when they show up, they're like,

52:19.520 --> 52:20.720
what happened?

52:20.720 --> 52:22.000
I gotta get rid of this horse.

52:22.000 --> 52:23.440
I gotta get rid of this horse.

52:23.440 --> 52:25.600
And then you show up like 15 minutes later,

52:25.600 --> 52:29.680
like, I heard you're having some horse problems.

52:29.680 --> 52:31.440
And then you're a real flimflamster.

52:32.240 --> 52:33.440
I came from the city.

52:33.440 --> 52:34.720
I work for horse control.

52:36.000 --> 52:36.720
It's a huge-

52:36.720 --> 52:40.240
You got trouble right here in River City with a capital H

52:40.240 --> 52:41.440
and that stands for horse.

52:41.440 --> 52:42.560
Doesn't rhyme with anything though.

52:43.920 --> 52:48.080
We got a call from a horse who said he was gonna,

52:48.080 --> 52:51.440
he said, and this is a direct quote from your horse,

52:51.440 --> 52:53.280
he's gonna jack up your shit.

52:53.280 --> 52:56.640
And then also he finished the fried chicken you had

52:56.640 --> 52:57.920
in your refrigerator.

52:57.920 --> 52:58.880
Go check, go check.

52:58.880 --> 53:00.160
I bet it's all gone.

53:00.160 --> 53:01.200
He ate all of it.

53:01.200 --> 53:02.240
He sounded drunk.

53:03.200 --> 53:05.120
God, what if a horse gonna taste for chicken?

53:07.120 --> 53:08.320
No chicken will be safe.

53:08.320 --> 53:09.200
No chicken's safe.

53:09.920 --> 53:11.200
Horses are so fast.

53:12.400 --> 53:15.200
And quite large, much larger than several chickens.

53:15.200 --> 53:17.520
Stop trying to ruin horses for me.

53:17.520 --> 53:18.640
Let's do another question.

53:19.360 --> 53:21.360
Travis, there are so many in Cincinnati.

53:21.360 --> 53:23.600
You could just have one.

53:24.640 --> 53:26.080
Just have a horse.

53:27.200 --> 53:28.160
I'll take it.

53:28.160 --> 53:28.880
I'll take it.

53:29.440 --> 53:29.920
It's free.

53:29.920 --> 53:31.440
Are they all old ass-

53:31.440 --> 53:33.920
Do not look in its fucking mouth.

53:33.920 --> 53:36.960
I have to assume if they're not old, they're crazy.

53:36.960 --> 53:39.600
Like they are ready to bite and down to kill.

53:41.120 --> 53:43.920
Which is what I am looking for in an equine companion.

53:43.920 --> 53:45.360
Oh, Travis, that'd be a nice business though.

53:45.360 --> 53:48.960
You get a young horse that's a kind of a dick.

53:49.520 --> 53:50.400
You break him.

53:50.400 --> 53:53.200
You bridle him and you resell him for a profit.

53:54.560 --> 53:56.080
Doesn't sound like any work at all.

53:56.720 --> 53:58.880
Sounds like I'd make money hand over fist.

53:58.880 --> 54:00.960
Now, when you worked at PetSmart,

54:00.960 --> 54:03.120
did you learn how to break and bridle a horse?

54:03.840 --> 54:05.040
Of course I did, Griffin.

54:05.520 --> 54:09.200
My education was three days long and all encompassing.

54:09.200 --> 54:13.680
For all animals under the sun, under God's domain.

54:13.680 --> 54:14.480
What do you got?

54:14.480 --> 54:19.040
The weirdest day was when we learned how to foster baby turtles.

54:19.040 --> 54:20.480
Yeah, when you birthed-

54:20.480 --> 54:21.600
That was one full day.

54:21.600 --> 54:23.760
Then you birthed that Komodo dragon.

54:23.760 --> 54:25.520
That was a life-changing experience.

54:25.520 --> 54:26.640
And it imprinted on me.

54:26.640 --> 54:28.880
That's why you always see me with that Komodo dragon all the time.

54:30.000 --> 54:31.840
I'm currently staying in a hotel now

54:31.840 --> 54:34.160
that serves complimentary breakfast in the mornings.

54:34.160 --> 54:38.240
Like a dummy, the only shoes I brought were big old hiking boots

54:38.240 --> 54:39.680
for the wintery weather outside.

54:39.680 --> 54:42.880
Is it acceptable for me to just wear my socks to the hotel?

54:42.880 --> 54:46.720
Ew, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

54:46.720 --> 54:49.040
This is from pretty sure I should be wearing shoes in Pittsburgh.

54:49.040 --> 54:50.000
Oh no, no.

54:50.000 --> 54:50.800
I mean, you know it.

54:50.800 --> 54:52.080
You said it in the name, no.

54:53.440 --> 54:54.640
No, come on.

54:54.640 --> 54:56.320
No, no, I'm eating.

54:57.120 --> 54:58.800
I'm eating a waffle I made.

54:58.800 --> 55:01.280
This is the fucking highlight of my entire year.

55:01.280 --> 55:03.040
Can you fucking put some shoes on?

55:04.400 --> 55:04.720
Please.

55:04.720 --> 55:06.240
Do your socks have holes in it?

55:06.240 --> 55:06.880
Doesn't matter.

55:07.680 --> 55:09.200
Put on some fucking shoes.

55:09.200 --> 55:09.840
I'm eating.

55:09.840 --> 55:13.680
If someone walks in in socks, my meal is over.

55:13.680 --> 55:14.480
My meal is done.

55:14.480 --> 55:14.960
If you're okay-

55:14.960 --> 55:17.440
Well, if someone walks in, Justin's meal is done

55:17.440 --> 55:19.680
because he cannot stand to share the room with anyone else.

55:19.680 --> 55:20.400
If you're okay-

55:20.400 --> 55:22.800
How much do you guys love when you're at a hotel

55:23.440 --> 55:27.840
and that hotel also has a pool and then pool people

55:28.480 --> 55:31.600
come to other areas of the hotel in pool garb

55:31.600 --> 55:36.560
as though they're just trying to bring their fucking kick back

55:36.560 --> 55:39.760
Jamaican lifestyle to us of clothes?

55:40.720 --> 55:43.440
Every time we've ever been at Great Wolf Lodge, it's like,

55:43.440 --> 55:46.080
oh, I'm going to go down to the restaurant and also

55:46.080 --> 55:48.960
the elevator is full of people that are soaking wet.

55:48.960 --> 55:50.720
It feels so judgmental.

55:50.720 --> 55:53.360
It's like those commercials for Jamaica, right?

55:53.360 --> 55:55.840
Kick back, have a cocktail, relax.

55:55.840 --> 55:56.560
Why are you so-

55:56.560 --> 55:58.400
It's like, listen, I'm at a hotel.

55:58.400 --> 56:00.000
I'm trying to live my day-to-day life.

56:00.000 --> 56:04.320
I can't join you in your fucking wet bacchanal.

56:04.320 --> 56:04.800
Right.

56:04.800 --> 56:05.520
I can't do it.

56:05.520 --> 56:07.760
Some of us have jobs and shoes.

56:08.640 --> 56:11.200
Jobs and shoes that are trying to eat free breakfast.

56:11.200 --> 56:12.400
That's crazy.

56:12.400 --> 56:16.080
You shouldn't eat any meal with bare feet ever.

56:16.080 --> 56:17.120
I think that's a sin.

56:19.680 --> 56:21.840
I'm okay with it as long as you're okay with me

56:21.840 --> 56:24.960
sucking on cantaloupe or staring at your toes.

56:24.960 --> 56:25.520
Is that cool?

56:26.240 --> 56:26.720
Is that all right?

56:26.720 --> 56:27.200
Is that okay?

56:28.560 --> 56:29.600
Because that's what's going to happen.

56:29.600 --> 56:32.320
I'll hold the cantaloupe between my thumb and forefinger

56:32.960 --> 56:36.960
and I'm just going to think about your jobs.

56:36.960 --> 56:40.400
I bet this question asker is pretty hungry at this point.

56:40.400 --> 56:40.640
Yeah.

56:40.640 --> 56:40.640
Yeah.

56:42.160 --> 56:43.280
Don't wait on us.

56:43.280 --> 56:44.800
I would just wear the boots.

56:44.800 --> 56:46.880
I mean, I would prefer the boots, right?

56:46.880 --> 56:50.720
I would just wear the boots and a onesie long underwear set.

56:50.720 --> 56:51.040
Yeah.

56:52.240 --> 56:56.160
Oh, do the boots and the red flannel underwear

56:56.160 --> 56:58.320
and then an old-timey miner's hat.

56:59.200 --> 57:01.200
And then just go for it.

57:01.200 --> 57:04.960
Bring your own thermos full of mine hooch.

57:06.320 --> 57:06.960
Yeah.

57:06.960 --> 57:08.240
I'm loving all of this.

57:08.240 --> 57:12.160
Talk about the vein you hit yesterday and how you think it's really going to pay out.

57:12.160 --> 57:13.760
Use your old prospector voice.

57:14.640 --> 57:16.880
This is the finest grits I've ever enjoyed.

57:17.840 --> 57:18.720
Boy, howdy.

57:18.720 --> 57:20.720
Sure does warm up the insides.

57:22.640 --> 57:24.480
You have any more of that good oatmeal?

57:25.440 --> 57:26.480
Where's the scrapple?

57:29.520 --> 57:30.640
Scrapple?

57:30.640 --> 57:32.960
I think we dug up Cthulhu yesterday.

57:33.920 --> 57:35.280
Let me get some oats.

57:35.280 --> 57:36.800
Hey, can you do me a favor?

57:36.800 --> 57:39.680
Can you tell that lady to put her fucking shoes on?

57:39.680 --> 57:42.480
Some of us are trying to live in a civilized society, goddammit.

57:55.040 --> 57:57.760
We hope you've enjoyed listening to our radio program,

57:57.760 --> 58:00.320
My Brother, My Brother, Me, and Advice Show for the Modern Era

58:00.320 --> 58:03.360
half as much as we've enjoyed creating it for you.

58:04.080 --> 58:05.840
Thank you to people tweeting about the show.

58:05.840 --> 58:13.840
Like Kyle Smith, Tyler Matheson, Corrin Porter, Stephanie Stone Rob, Slinky123, John Elliott,

58:15.200 --> 58:21.920
Chetur, Chelsea Care, Christina, Funny Girl from Floor 9, Eru, Recovering Ninja Cat,

58:21.920 --> 58:22.560
so many others.

58:23.120 --> 58:26.720
You're all the best and we sure appreciate all those tweets.

58:26.720 --> 58:29.360
If you want to tweet about the show, maybe include a link to our sampler.

58:29.360 --> 58:33.200
It's bit.ly forward slash mbmbam2013.

58:33.200 --> 58:36.000
Um, I want to say thank you to everyone.

58:36.000 --> 58:38.560
There was such an abundance of really good questions.

58:38.560 --> 58:40.560
Yeah, I got a shit ton of great yahoo's too.

58:40.560 --> 58:41.360
Thank you guys.

58:41.360 --> 58:45.440
I don't think I don't think I read a yahoo today that was sent in by somebody who has

58:45.440 --> 58:46.320
done it before.

58:46.320 --> 58:47.360
Like, that's awesome.

58:47.360 --> 58:48.480
Thank you guys so much.

58:48.480 --> 58:49.760
Welcome to the game.

58:49.760 --> 58:53.360
Yeah, and I don't think I've ever said it before, but if you know, we don't have time

58:53.360 --> 58:54.560
to answer everybody's questions.

58:54.560 --> 58:58.240
So if you've ever sent in a question before and you haven't heard us answer it,

58:58.240 --> 58:59.680
feel free to send it in again.

58:59.680 --> 59:03.120
I mean, it's quite possible that it's not that we didn't want to do it.

59:03.120 --> 59:04.160
We just ran out of time.

59:04.160 --> 59:06.880
Sometimes we have them on the on the list of questions to hit.

59:06.880 --> 59:07.680
We just don't get to them.

59:07.680 --> 59:08.800
Yeah, and we read everything.

59:08.800 --> 59:12.000
So so so do keep sending us in real quick.

59:12.000 --> 59:15.280
I want to thank John Roderick and the long winters for the use of our theme song, which

59:15.280 --> 59:17.760
is it's a departure off the album, putting the days to bed.

59:17.760 --> 59:22.000
When I was putting together yahoo's this morning, I was listening to putting the days

59:22.000 --> 59:22.800
to bed.

59:22.800 --> 59:26.240
And like, it's weird whenever it's a departure comes on.

59:26.240 --> 59:28.320
I like get like freaked out.

59:28.320 --> 59:31.200
I think it's I think this show gives me a panic attack.

59:31.200 --> 59:33.920
And so when I hear it, I'm like, oh, God, do I need to be on right now?

59:35.120 --> 59:39.360
So if you want to have that same panic attack, you can get putting the days to bed on, you

59:54.800 --> 59:57.680
Go kick in some bucks and maybe go to the event.

59:57.680 --> 59:59.840

59:59.840 --> 01:00:03.120

01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:07.680

01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:08.320

I listen to it every week.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:43.840
And yeah, go look at all those.

01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:46.640
If you have any questions for our guestpert, it's going to be on next week.

01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:48.080
Send those in.

01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:50.080
What's the topic?

01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:55.440
The topic that our guestpert is a guestpert in is gays and lesbians in the media.

01:00:56.400 --> 01:00:59.680
So if you want to focus your questions on that, or if you just have any questions

01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:05.040
that you don't want us to answer because you know we don't know about it, that seems like

01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:10.240
a pretty safe bet to just make sure you put like guestpert in the subject so that we do

01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:13.600
not miss them and that we know that you want it directed specifically at our guestpert.

01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:14.480
All right.

01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:15.360
You guys ready for that final?

And every week we're lucky enough to be joined by a guest, sometimes a comedian,

01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:20.560
or sometimes just somebody that we like and somebody probably you've never heard of.
