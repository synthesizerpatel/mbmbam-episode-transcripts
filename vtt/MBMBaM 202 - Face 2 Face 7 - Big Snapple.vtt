00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.000 --> 00:11.000
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on the wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.000 --> 00:18.000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

00:18.000 --> 00:43.000
What's up, you cool baby?

00:43.000 --> 00:44.000
Hell yeah!

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
What up?

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
What's up?

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
Who brought the cheer wine?

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
Who brought the...

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
Yeah!

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
Nice.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
Good looking out.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
How's Florida?

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
Holy shit!

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
This guy...

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
Did everybody hear that?

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
I hope you all feel bad about yourself.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
This guy drove 20...

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
30 hours to be here today.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
Do you want to start the show, Justin?

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
My name is Justin McElroy.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
I...

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
Hold on a second.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
I didn't...

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
You know what?

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
I hadn't started recording yet.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
This time, for sure.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
Should we start?

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
Should we walk out again?

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
Yeah, we can.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
Well, we can.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
We can.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
We can.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
We can.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
We can.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
We can.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
We can.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
We can.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
We can.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
Yeah, we can.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
Welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me, and My Show for the Moderna Era.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
Sweet, sweet baby Griffin McElroy.

01:25.000 --> 01:32.080
Let me just jack into the Matrix real quick.

01:32.080 --> 01:39.000
So, thank you all for coming to our comedy advice podcast.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.920
You're here in New York.

01:40.920 --> 01:45.480
This is our first time doing My Brother, My Brother, Me here in...

01:45.480 --> 01:46.840
in New York City.

01:48.380 --> 01:51.120
Here are the big Snapple.

01:51.120 --> 01:53.040
I came over that earlier, it's good, right?

01:53.040 --> 01:55.660
Oh, my god, he is not joking.

01:55.660 --> 01:57.060
He was.

01:57.060 --> 01:58.420
I was so excited about it,

01:58.420 --> 01:59.620
and I told everyone in our group.

01:59.620 --> 02:01.080
He was word shopping that

02:01.080 --> 02:03.240
on the street a couple hours ago.

02:03.240 --> 02:05.380
And by word shopping I mean he said it once

02:05.380 --> 02:09.620
and nobody laughed or responded to it in any way.

02:09.620 --> 02:11.700
Dog pound, I swear to god, he says,

02:11.700 --> 02:13.560
this is my, this is the dog pound.

02:13.560 --> 02:19.560
I should have said it was like the Greek chorus thing.

02:19.560 --> 02:21.560
Excellent joke.

02:21.560 --> 02:30.560
We were walking and we had not heard the beginning of the conversation because we got split up by the intersection.

02:30.560 --> 02:34.560
And we catch up with him and he says, hey guys, big snapper.

02:34.560 --> 02:44.560
Just so you know, the beginning of the conversation was, there's so much to do and see here in the big snapper.

02:44.560 --> 02:50.560
So I didn't miss. No, well, I felt like you didn't really get it.

02:50.560 --> 02:54.560
This is a randy audience, can I say that?

02:54.560 --> 02:56.560
You guys are a little randy.

02:56.560 --> 02:58.560
You guys are very productive.

02:58.560 --> 03:01.560
And what's funny is I know you're not drunk because you all stood outside.

03:01.560 --> 03:04.560
There's a bar, you guys could have chilled in.

03:04.560 --> 03:10.560
And what I love is that you waited in line outside where it's like, I don't know, it's outside so that's not ideal.

03:10.560 --> 03:17.560
And the reason that you were waiting in line from what we were told was because you wanted to get the best seats that you possibly could.

03:17.560 --> 03:21.560
Which is great because it means you're like, your fans, and that's obviously very flattering.

03:21.560 --> 03:24.560
But it also means that you're very polite and you understand how lines work.

03:24.560 --> 03:27.560
And you don't throw yourself in a crowd and fist fight each other.

03:27.560 --> 03:33.560
You must have been surprised when you got in here and realized there wasn't a single seat you couldn't spit on us from.

03:33.560 --> 03:36.560
There were also just three dudes sitting at the table.

03:36.560 --> 03:39.560
So I don't know what you were afraid you wouldn't see.

03:39.560 --> 03:43.560
They were afraid they missed our electric light show.

03:43.560 --> 03:45.560
Lasers. Can we activate our...

03:45.560 --> 03:47.560
Can we cue the show for them?

03:47.560 --> 03:49.560
Yeah.

03:49.560 --> 03:51.560
Hey audience at home.

03:51.560 --> 03:53.560
I should have bought a ticket.

03:53.560 --> 03:57.560
You didn't get a ticket because you waited a minute and a half.

03:57.560 --> 03:59.560
Again, you guys are crazy. Thank you very, very much.

03:59.560 --> 04:01.560
Let's start doing questions.

04:01.560 --> 04:03.560
Oh, by the way.

04:03.560 --> 04:05.560
Oh man.

04:05.560 --> 04:07.560
Jinx.

04:07.560 --> 04:09.560
Now that we can't talk, listen to me.

04:09.560 --> 04:11.560
This is a shitty show.

04:11.560 --> 04:13.560
Bitch, you just talked.

04:13.560 --> 04:16.560
We may, if we have time, we may do a couple of questions for people here.

04:16.560 --> 04:18.560
So think if we have a good one.

04:18.560 --> 04:21.560
Not like a bad one because we will get a freaking problem.

04:21.560 --> 04:24.560
Nothing about wanting to have sex with your friend's girlfriend.

04:24.560 --> 04:26.560
Or dog.

04:26.560 --> 04:28.560
Or car.

04:28.560 --> 04:30.560
Or garbage compactor.

04:30.560 --> 04:32.560
I don't know why you'd want to have sex with garbage compactor.

04:32.560 --> 04:34.560
Trash free.

04:34.560 --> 04:36.560
Okay, great.

04:36.560 --> 04:39.560
So these first couple of questions are from people that are hypothetically here.

04:39.560 --> 04:41.560
So feel free to raise your hand.

04:41.560 --> 04:43.560
I won't be able to see you, but sure.

04:43.560 --> 04:45.560
I'm from the Midwest and since moving to New York,

04:45.560 --> 04:48.560
I've heard that Dime Mountain Dew is a broke ass

04:48.560 --> 04:51.560
or trashy soft drink.

04:51.560 --> 04:53.560
Is this true?

04:53.560 --> 04:55.560
Am I drinking a soda that will make me look trashy?

04:55.560 --> 04:57.560
That's from John Wagner. John, are you here?

04:57.560 --> 04:59.560
I'm here.

04:59.560 --> 05:01.560
I'm from the Dog Tale.

05:01.560 --> 05:03.560
John Wagner.

05:03.560 --> 05:06.560
Hold on, let me figure this out because it's like what a dog tale is.

05:08.560 --> 05:10.560
He can't think if you laugh.

05:10.560 --> 05:16.560
Which explains a lot, John.

05:16.560 --> 05:20.560
Is that like a Midwest?

05:20.560 --> 05:22.560
I mean, I know, Justin, it's your, like,

05:22.560 --> 05:24.560
I know you're big on Pepsi Max now.

05:24.560 --> 05:26.560
Yeah, I weigh into Pepsi Max.

05:26.560 --> 05:28.560
I was into Dime Mountain Dew for a while.

05:28.560 --> 05:31.560
When I was, this was like actually caught me by surprise.

05:31.560 --> 05:34.560
Because where we grew up,

05:34.560 --> 05:37.560
what I had associated Mountain Dew with

05:37.560 --> 05:40.560
was what the copious amounts of advertising I'd seen associated with,

05:40.560 --> 05:43.560
which is like extreme sports.

05:43.560 --> 05:45.560
So I think if you're doing Mountain Dew, you're doing the Dew.

05:45.560 --> 05:49.560
You're probably shredding or carving, maybe.

05:49.560 --> 05:52.560
Wind jamming.

05:52.560 --> 05:57.560
My friend, Michael Beth, I met him from college and he was from Ohio.

05:59.560 --> 06:02.560
Let's hear it for Ohio!

06:02.560 --> 06:04.560
Dayton, more specifically.

06:04.560 --> 06:11.560
Who has any feelings about Dayton positive or negative?

06:11.560 --> 06:15.560
And we were drinking Mountain Dew and we offered him one and he said,

06:15.560 --> 06:17.560
Oh no, my mother says...

06:17.560 --> 06:18.560
That's what he sounds like?

06:18.560 --> 06:19.560
Yeah, it's not a joke.

06:19.560 --> 06:20.560
Justin's not doing his, like, jokes.

06:20.560 --> 06:23.560
He sounds like Kemo Phillips having a stroke.

06:23.560 --> 06:27.560
Oh no, my mother says that Mountain Dew is for briars.

06:29.560 --> 06:33.560
That story's so much funnier if you know Michael Beck, which nobody here does.

06:33.560 --> 06:36.560
Let's hear it for Michael Beck!

06:38.560 --> 06:41.560
Briars was another term that I was not familiar with,

06:41.560 --> 06:43.560
but apparently it means hill people.

06:45.560 --> 06:51.560
I heard a theory online that if you spill Mountain Dew or Diet Mountain Dew on the sidewalk,

06:51.560 --> 06:54.560
the puddle that it forms, no matter how you spill it,

06:54.560 --> 06:58.560
or the weather effects that it might have on the spill,

06:58.560 --> 07:01.560
it will splash down in the perfect shape of the state of West Virginia.

07:01.560 --> 07:04.560
It's true. Look online. Google search that.

07:04.560 --> 07:07.560
Every time. Perfect. Two panhandles.

07:07.560 --> 07:10.560
The West Coast.

07:11.560 --> 07:13.560
It's a coast. It's on a river.

07:13.560 --> 07:14.560
Sure.

07:14.560 --> 07:16.560
You want to know my geography more?

07:16.560 --> 07:18.560
Well, so my other question is the other side of that.

07:18.560 --> 07:22.560
Is there a soda you could drink that makes you look like the classiest fellow?

07:22.560 --> 07:23.560
Is there a soda?

07:23.560 --> 07:24.560
Yeah.

07:24.560 --> 07:27.560
Like if you're drinking Diet Cheer wine and someone goes,

07:27.560 --> 07:29.560
How sophisticated.

07:29.560 --> 07:30.560
I feel like, what about...

07:30.560 --> 07:32.560
Jones? Jones sodas?

07:32.560 --> 07:33.560
That's something that...

07:33.560 --> 07:34.560
That's pretty good.

07:34.560 --> 07:35.560
I'm pretty good.

07:36.560 --> 07:37.560
I drinked it.

07:37.560 --> 07:38.560
No, you're right.

07:38.560 --> 07:39.560
That's what I know too.

07:39.560 --> 07:42.560
They were like small batch root beers? Is that a thing?

07:42.560 --> 07:43.560
Yeah.

07:43.560 --> 07:44.560
Oh.

07:44.560 --> 07:46.560
Micro brew root beers?

07:46.560 --> 07:47.560
Get out.

07:47.560 --> 07:48.560
Did I make that?

07:48.560 --> 07:49.560
I thought I created that in my mind's eye.

07:49.560 --> 07:50.560
No.

07:52.560 --> 07:54.560
Do you guys want to ask him a question?

07:54.560 --> 07:55.560
Oh, do you?

07:55.560 --> 07:56.560
Yeah.

07:56.560 --> 07:58.560
Yeah.

07:58.560 --> 08:00.560
I'm going to give you regular questions only.

08:00.560 --> 08:01.560
I have three choices.

08:03.560 --> 08:09.560
This Yahoo answer was sent in by Himmel member and level 8 Yahoo Shaman,

08:09.560 --> 08:10.560
Drew Davenport.

08:10.560 --> 08:11.560
Thank you, Drew.

08:11.560 --> 08:16.560
It's by Yahoo Answers user Bulls Cubs Fan who asks,

08:16.560 --> 08:21.560
Is a loveseat called a loveseat because people have sex on it?

08:21.560 --> 08:26.560
But I love how that question is.

08:26.560 --> 08:28.560
It would imply that they couldn't come up with a name

08:28.560 --> 08:30.560
and they like field tested it.

08:30.560 --> 08:31.560
I put two people on.

08:31.560 --> 08:32.560
Whoa.

08:34.560 --> 08:35.560
Holy shit.

08:35.560 --> 08:36.560
All right.

08:36.560 --> 08:37.560
Loveseat it is.

08:37.560 --> 08:41.560
That's the fucks over for sure.

08:41.560 --> 08:46.560
I don't think we can sell those at the big Sandy Superstore.

08:46.560 --> 08:49.560
Our branding expert wasn't even out of the room.

08:49.560 --> 08:53.560
Our brand Shaman Skylar hadn't even left the room yet

08:53.560 --> 08:55.560
before you started having sex on it.

08:58.560 --> 09:00.560
Did they know each other before this?

09:00.560 --> 09:03.560
No, the power of the sofa, sir.

09:03.560 --> 09:09.560
Etymologic or entomologic, one of those two, strictly speaking.

09:09.560 --> 09:11.560
Etymomically.

09:11.560 --> 09:13.560
It has to have something to do with it, right?

09:13.560 --> 09:14.560
Etymomically speaking.

09:14.560 --> 09:16.560
You can only fit two people on there.

09:16.560 --> 09:17.560
Sorry?

09:17.560 --> 09:19.560
You can only fit two people on it.

09:19.560 --> 09:20.560
Two regular people?

09:20.560 --> 09:21.560
Yeah.

09:21.560 --> 09:23.560
One big person, three little people.

09:23.560 --> 09:24.560
Cheat the chart.

09:24.560 --> 09:26.560
Yeah, a million borrowers.

09:26.560 --> 09:27.560
What are we doing?

09:32.560 --> 09:34.560
I've been watching a lot of my 600 pound life

09:34.560 --> 09:36.560
and I don't want you to say they aren't people

09:36.560 --> 09:39.560
because you cannot fit two normal loveseats.

09:39.560 --> 09:40.560
That's fair, great.

09:40.560 --> 09:41.560
And you wouldn't want to

09:41.560 --> 09:42.560
because they'd initially start having sex

09:42.560 --> 09:45.560
and go, thank you, check please.

09:45.560 --> 09:48.560
Or you'd rather not.

09:48.560 --> 09:49.560
Oh, boy.

09:49.560 --> 09:51.560
I don't think that would be a comfortable platform

09:51.560 --> 09:53.560
for that experience.

09:53.560 --> 09:55.560
Well, do you think that it started off as like they

09:55.560 --> 09:58.560
first said, hey, two people, which of these

09:58.560 --> 10:00.560
would you choose to have sex on?

10:00.560 --> 10:01.560
And it was like a Goldilocks kind of thing?

10:01.560 --> 10:03.560
Like they tried it in a recliner and they're like,

10:03.560 --> 10:04.560
oh, no, no, no, no.

10:04.560 --> 10:05.560
And then they did it on a couch.

10:05.560 --> 10:06.560
Like, how can I even reach them?

10:06.560 --> 10:07.560
They're so far away.

10:10.560 --> 10:11.560
They were trying to have sex.

10:11.560 --> 10:12.560
I don't even know what to do with it.

10:12.560 --> 10:14.560
And then they got on a loveseat and said, yes.

10:14.560 --> 10:15.560
This is it.

10:15.560 --> 10:17.560
They originally were trying to have sex on the couch.

10:17.560 --> 10:19.560
Oh, this is going to be a fucking great reference.

10:19.560 --> 10:20.560
Fuck it, everybody.

10:20.560 --> 10:23.560
From the Gallagher live stage show.

10:23.560 --> 10:25.560
But then they found John Lacherio's

10:25.560 --> 10:27.560
and started having sex.

10:27.560 --> 10:29.560
We can't have sex here.

10:29.560 --> 10:30.560
Gallagher is out there.

10:30.560 --> 10:32.560
Gallagher has touched this.

10:32.560 --> 10:34.560
I don't want to have sex on the couch.

10:34.560 --> 10:36.560
And Gallagher's over there masturbating.

10:39.560 --> 10:41.560
They all pictured it, didn't they?

10:41.560 --> 10:43.560
That sentence is out there.

10:43.560 --> 10:45.560
That's why everybody in the first year

10:45.560 --> 10:46.560
has those plastic wraps.

10:51.560 --> 10:53.560
Is Gallagher here tonight?

10:53.560 --> 10:55.560
Oh, Gallagher 2 is.

10:57.560 --> 11:00.560
No big Gallagher 2 fans?

11:00.560 --> 11:02.560
All right, next question.

11:02.560 --> 11:04.560
I recently decided to move in with a friend of mine

11:04.560 --> 11:06.560
and all seems to be going well so far.

11:06.560 --> 11:08.560
My issue comes from when we signed the lease.

11:08.560 --> 11:10.560
I had come to the lease signing prepared

11:10.560 --> 11:11.560
to pay for my half of the deposit,

11:11.560 --> 11:13.560
only to find that my roommate had decided

11:13.560 --> 11:15.560
to pay the entire amount.

11:15.560 --> 11:16.560
My question now is,

11:16.560 --> 11:17.560
what do I do with the money

11:17.560 --> 11:18.560
I would have spent on the deposit?

11:18.560 --> 11:21.560
Am I required to spend it on stuff for the apartment?

11:21.560 --> 11:23.560
And if so, what should I spend it on?

11:23.560 --> 11:25.560
And that's from Suddenly Affluent in Astoria.

11:25.560 --> 11:26.560
Are you here?

11:26.560 --> 11:27.560
Right there.

11:27.560 --> 11:28.560
All right.

11:28.560 --> 11:30.560
I mean, you're a thief.

11:33.560 --> 11:35.560
I've never rented a New York apartment,

11:35.560 --> 11:41.560
but I imagine the deposit is like $14,000.

11:41.560 --> 11:43.560
But I mean, you got away with it.

11:43.560 --> 11:44.560
Until now?

11:44.560 --> 11:46.560
Until like 30 seconds ago.

11:46.560 --> 11:47.560
Perfect crime.

11:47.560 --> 11:48.560
It was the perfect crime

11:48.560 --> 11:51.560
and then it was the shittiest crime.

11:51.560 --> 11:53.560
Well, here's the catch.

11:53.560 --> 11:57.560
Your roommate will get that deposit back hypothetically

11:57.560 --> 12:00.560
and you will not get money back for whatever you are.

12:00.560 --> 12:01.560
So you need to think less about

12:01.560 --> 12:03.560
what you're going to spend your stolen money on

12:03.560 --> 12:05.560
and more about like,

12:05.560 --> 12:09.560
you can do all kinds of wack shit in this apartment.

12:09.560 --> 12:11.560
You need to start kicking holes in the wall,

12:11.560 --> 12:14.560
burn the carpet, whatever you need to do.

12:14.560 --> 12:16.560
You no longer have a horse in this race.

12:16.560 --> 12:19.560
Whatever the condition is, is what it is.

12:19.560 --> 12:22.560
Oh, you can hang a bunch of shelves?

12:22.560 --> 12:25.560
Repaint the wall and mix sawdust into the paint

12:25.560 --> 12:27.560
and get a nice textured look.

12:27.560 --> 12:30.560
Welcome to Property Brothers.

12:30.560 --> 12:32.560
They're fucking shit up.

12:32.560 --> 12:34.560
You didn't want to sell this again, did you?

12:34.560 --> 12:38.560
We're going to put a really nice reclaimed ivy up here.

12:38.560 --> 12:39.560
Really support it.

12:39.560 --> 12:41.560
You know, really fuck this place up.

12:41.560 --> 12:43.560
Really, really fuck it up.

12:43.560 --> 12:44.560
They'll never get that up.

12:44.560 --> 12:45.560
You didn't pay the deposit on that.

12:45.560 --> 12:46.560
Oh, you stole it. Great. Cool.

12:46.560 --> 12:47.560
No, you're fine. Yeah, perfect.

12:47.560 --> 12:49.560
We are going to ruin this.

12:49.560 --> 12:51.560
We're going to get bathtub on the ceiling.

12:51.560 --> 12:52.560
Yeah.

12:52.560 --> 12:53.560
Just cause.

12:53.560 --> 12:54.560
Why not?

12:54.560 --> 12:55.560
Fuck it.

12:55.560 --> 12:56.560
Could that help?

12:56.560 --> 12:57.560
Try it.

12:57.560 --> 13:00.560
Try to yaboo.

13:00.560 --> 13:04.560
Really, you're not going to attempt to help that gentleman.

13:04.560 --> 13:06.560
I mean, I wouldn't...

13:06.560 --> 13:07.560
Here's the thing.

13:07.560 --> 13:11.560
You have entered into an emotional battlefield.

13:11.560 --> 13:14.560
The next few months to years, but let's be honest,

13:14.560 --> 13:17.560
months of your life are going to be about the power struggle

13:17.560 --> 13:19.560
between you and this person.

13:19.560 --> 13:20.560
You cannot see the victory this early.

13:20.560 --> 13:22.560
Here's what you need to do.

13:22.560 --> 13:24.560
He's not going to take a check.

13:24.560 --> 13:26.560
He's not going to take a stack of cash

13:26.560 --> 13:27.560
if he wants to out line around.

13:27.560 --> 13:29.560
What you've got to do is slowly repay this debt.

13:29.560 --> 13:31.560
Which I mean, anytime you see an open pocket.

13:31.560 --> 13:33.560
If you see his...

13:33.560 --> 13:34.560
He leaves his jorts out.

13:34.560 --> 13:36.560
Whatever.

13:36.560 --> 13:38.560
Jorts is not going to fit.

13:38.560 --> 13:39.560
A lot of money.

13:39.560 --> 13:40.560
No, no, no.

13:40.560 --> 13:41.560
Just like a jorts full.

13:41.560 --> 13:44.560
You slip one dollar in.

13:44.560 --> 13:46.560
He'll never notice.

13:46.560 --> 13:47.560
I'm like, huh.

13:47.560 --> 13:48.560
A dollar.

13:48.560 --> 13:49.560
Cool, I forgot.

13:49.560 --> 13:51.560
And then with the 800,000th dollar,

13:51.560 --> 13:53.560
which is what I'm assuming your deposit is,

13:53.560 --> 13:56.560
you have to present it like a pain in the feet.

13:56.560 --> 14:05.560
I think we're through here.

14:05.560 --> 14:08.560
That's a great plan to pay back your fee.

14:08.560 --> 14:09.560
Your fee-fee.

14:09.560 --> 14:12.560
And it's also a great plan to slowly drive your roommate.

14:12.560 --> 14:16.560
Yeah, if you want to gas light your roommate real bad,

14:16.560 --> 14:19.560
do that and move the furniture one inch out of the way.

14:19.560 --> 14:21.560
Are we talking singles only?

14:21.560 --> 14:22.560
Because that's like the whole apartment.

14:22.560 --> 14:23.560
How about just quarters?

14:23.560 --> 14:25.560
And you put them random places.

14:25.560 --> 14:27.560
Like underneath his shoe, inside his shoe.

14:27.560 --> 14:29.560
Something where he's like, what the fuck?

14:29.560 --> 14:33.560
What are these people doing?

14:33.560 --> 14:35.560
Can we talk about, we didn't address this,

14:35.560 --> 14:36.560
but it's sort of germane.

14:36.560 --> 14:38.560
It happened to us earlier this morning,

14:38.560 --> 14:40.560
and it was so crazy that we didn't talk about it,

14:40.560 --> 14:42.560
but we were getting on the elevator at our hotel.

14:42.560 --> 14:43.560
There's a dude waiting on the elevator

14:43.560 --> 14:46.560
who had dropped a $50 bill on the floor.

14:46.560 --> 14:49.560
And like I pointed out, like, hey, you dropped $50.

14:49.560 --> 14:51.560
That's the craziest thing ever, right?

14:51.560 --> 14:52.560
Like I wanted to chide him.

14:52.560 --> 14:54.560
Like, that's $50.

14:54.560 --> 14:57.560
What kind of person are you that you can drop $50?

14:57.560 --> 15:00.560
That was only the third time I've ever seen one of those

15:00.560 --> 15:02.560
in my life.

15:02.560 --> 15:06.560
I had one once, and I like duct taped it to my thigh.

15:06.560 --> 15:09.560
He should have felt the weight change from his fall down.

15:09.560 --> 15:10.560
Oh, something's different.

15:10.560 --> 15:11.560
Hold on.

15:11.560 --> 15:12.560
My boys.

15:12.560 --> 15:15.560
I've been carrying like a plastic case for like baseball cards

15:15.560 --> 15:16.560
or something like that.

15:16.560 --> 15:19.560
Also, if you drop a $50 bill, and someone is like,

15:19.560 --> 15:20.560
hey, you dropped your $50 bill.

15:20.560 --> 15:23.560
You have to give a piece of it at least.

15:23.560 --> 15:24.560
Don't you expect a little bit like a...

15:24.560 --> 15:27.560
I seriously thought, I thought John Keane was going to jump out

15:27.560 --> 15:28.560
and be like, you did it right.

15:28.560 --> 15:30.560
Good.

15:30.560 --> 15:31.560
You picked the right answer.

15:31.560 --> 15:32.560
Why did you do that?

15:32.560 --> 15:34.560
Explain your bravery.

15:34.560 --> 15:40.560
Next step on Upworthy, you won't believe that this man...

15:40.560 --> 15:45.560
One man dropped $50, you won't believe this other man's response.

15:45.560 --> 15:49.560
You won't believe this little boy's response.

15:49.560 --> 15:51.560
You dropped your money.

15:51.560 --> 15:55.560
His only child doesn't swipe it.

15:55.560 --> 15:57.560
How about Yahoo?

15:57.560 --> 15:58.560
Yeah.

15:58.560 --> 15:59.560
Let's see.

15:59.560 --> 16:01.560
It got the response.

16:01.560 --> 16:03.560
Positive reinforcement concept.

16:03.560 --> 16:05.560
This was sent in by Evan Weston.

16:05.560 --> 16:06.560
Thank you, Evan.

16:06.560 --> 16:07.560
It's by Yahoo Answers.

16:07.560 --> 16:09.560
This is the fucking worst website.

16:09.560 --> 16:12.560
It's been suspended.

16:12.560 --> 16:14.560
But the question remains.

16:14.560 --> 16:18.560
They asked posthumously,

16:18.560 --> 16:28.560
how do I make the garbage man fall in love with me?

16:28.560 --> 16:30.560
I'm in love with him.

16:30.560 --> 16:34.560
I wait every Monday morning and the first Friday of every month.

16:34.560 --> 16:37.560
That's kind of a fucked up trash collection schedule.

16:37.560 --> 16:39.560
The first Friday is for the baby things.

16:39.560 --> 16:40.560
That's ball collect.

16:40.560 --> 16:41.560
That makes sense.

16:41.560 --> 16:48.560
You've seen him use those big strong arms to pick up the garbage.

16:48.560 --> 16:49.560
Like that.

16:49.560 --> 16:50.560
Go on.

16:50.560 --> 16:52.560
No matter how much garbage I put in there,

16:52.560 --> 16:55.560
he still picks it up with ease.

16:55.560 --> 16:57.560
I had thrown away 20 bricks.

16:57.560 --> 17:00.560
Wasn't a problem.

17:00.560 --> 17:03.560
That fool got it.

17:03.560 --> 17:05.560
How do I win his heart?

17:05.560 --> 17:08.560
You could start by not throwing away so much heavy shit.

17:08.560 --> 17:09.560
Yeah.

17:09.560 --> 17:14.560
You could maybe stop making every day for this man a test of skill.

17:14.560 --> 17:16.560
Why don't we just bury all the trash in your yard

17:16.560 --> 17:18.560
and put an empty garbage can out there?

17:18.560 --> 17:19.560
He doesn't pick it up.

17:19.560 --> 17:20.560
He picks it up.

17:20.560 --> 17:21.560
It's empty.

17:21.560 --> 17:22.560
He looks up.

17:22.560 --> 17:23.560
Is that you, Diane?

17:23.560 --> 17:24.560
You're like, that's me.

17:24.560 --> 17:25.560
Happy birthday.

17:25.560 --> 17:27.560
Do you want to move in together?

17:27.560 --> 17:32.560
I have a buried pile of trash in my yard.

17:32.560 --> 17:36.560
Could you throw away awesome shit?

17:36.560 --> 17:38.560
Not expensive shit that he's going to keep.

17:38.560 --> 17:39.560
Not a bribe.

17:39.560 --> 17:41.560
But something where he literally goes,

17:41.560 --> 17:42.560
man, this person's awesome.

17:42.560 --> 17:44.560
Yeah, you have to find out his facts.

17:44.560 --> 17:46.560
That does assume that your garbage man is coming to you going,

17:46.560 --> 17:48.560
well, hold on before I throw this away.

17:48.560 --> 17:50.560
Let me build a character profile.

17:50.560 --> 17:53.560
Let's make sure there's no awesome shit in here.

17:53.560 --> 17:55.560
Just count pasta.

17:55.560 --> 17:57.560
No, thank you.

17:57.560 --> 18:00.560
You threw away the entirety of X-Files on DVD.

18:00.560 --> 18:03.560
What a cool lady.

18:03.560 --> 18:05.560
With apparently money deferred.

18:05.560 --> 18:10.560
These four are newly found distains for the X-Files.

18:10.560 --> 18:12.560
A book called How to Seduce a Garbage Man

18:12.560 --> 18:14.560
and give him everything non-sexually.

18:14.560 --> 18:15.560
Crazy.

18:15.560 --> 18:20.560
How have I not heard of this book?

18:20.560 --> 18:22.560
You could hide in the trash can.

18:22.560 --> 18:27.560
You could.

18:27.560 --> 18:30.560
You hear the truck on by and poof.

18:30.560 --> 18:32.560
What's up?

18:32.560 --> 18:35.560
And then you're wearing some sexy lingerie.

18:35.560 --> 18:38.560
In the trash can.

18:38.560 --> 18:39.560
You know what's special for you?

18:39.560 --> 18:40.560
I'm garbage.

18:40.560 --> 18:42.560
You got an Oscar of the Grouches.

18:42.560 --> 18:43.560
I'm garbage.

18:43.560 --> 18:46.560
I'm what you know.

18:46.560 --> 18:50.560
I want to be a part of the world.

18:50.560 --> 18:51.560
Look at this stuff.

18:51.560 --> 18:59.560
Isn't it neat?

18:59.560 --> 19:02.560
The trash can actor broke both of my...

19:02.560 --> 19:03.560
What's the word again?

19:03.560 --> 19:18.560
Legs.

19:18.560 --> 19:21.560
We're not going to top that joke for the rest of the day.

19:21.560 --> 19:22.560
You did warn me.

19:22.560 --> 19:23.560
For like 30 minutes.

19:23.560 --> 19:25.560
I thought we agreed in the pre-creditor

19:25.560 --> 19:28.560
we were going to save the little mermaid garbage man.

19:28.560 --> 19:31.560
How about another question from a normie?

19:31.560 --> 19:32.560
Okay, let's see.

19:32.560 --> 19:33.560
I'm going to save that one.

19:33.560 --> 19:35.560
Let's go.

19:35.560 --> 19:36.560
Okay.

19:36.560 --> 19:39.560
This may be my favorite question we've ever received.

19:39.560 --> 19:40.560
Okay.

19:40.560 --> 19:41.560
Sorry, everybody else here...

19:41.560 --> 19:44.560
All the questions is dump.

19:44.560 --> 19:47.560
When ordering a pizza online the other day,

19:47.560 --> 19:50.560
I accidentally typed in the wrong apartment number.

19:50.560 --> 19:53.560
By the time I noticed my mistake and called the pizza place,

19:53.560 --> 19:54.560
it was too late.

19:54.560 --> 19:55.560
The people...

19:55.560 --> 19:56.560
Son of a bitch.

19:56.560 --> 19:59.560
The people in the wrong apartment took the free pizza

19:59.560 --> 20:02.560
rather than admitting it wasn't theirs.

20:02.560 --> 20:07.560
I know where these pizza thieves live.

20:07.560 --> 20:08.560
What are my options?

20:08.560 --> 20:11.560
And that's from Trustless in California.

20:11.560 --> 20:12.560
Big thanks first off to Justin

20:12.560 --> 20:15.560
for grabbing the crunchiest food on the table.

20:15.560 --> 20:18.560
You could have gone banana and nobody would have known

20:18.560 --> 20:20.560
and you went with kettle cooked potato chips.

20:20.560 --> 20:21.560
What the fuck are these?

20:21.560 --> 20:22.560
What is a chocoroon?

20:22.560 --> 20:24.560
What is a chocoroon?

20:24.560 --> 20:25.560
Wait a minute.

20:25.560 --> 20:26.560
Time out on this question.

20:26.560 --> 20:29.560
What is a chocoroon?

20:29.560 --> 20:31.560
Sweet and crispy.

20:31.560 --> 20:32.560
Hold on a second.

20:32.560 --> 20:36.560
We need to take a quick break.

20:36.560 --> 20:39.560
Welcome to the Mavro Brothers Eat Snacks.

20:39.560 --> 20:41.560
Can we take chocoroons to the Money Zone?

20:41.560 --> 20:43.560
Yeah, let's go to the Money Zone.

20:43.560 --> 20:45.560
Wait, you're going to wait and eat them together?

20:45.560 --> 20:46.560
No.

20:46.560 --> 20:48.560
Oh, okay.

20:48.560 --> 20:51.560
Chocoroons wait for no man.

20:51.560 --> 20:52.560
Pretty good.

20:52.560 --> 20:55.560
It's way better than regular mushrooms.

20:55.560 --> 20:58.560
Regular mushrooms are not chocolatey or crispy.

20:58.560 --> 20:59.560
Okay, great.

20:59.560 --> 21:02.560
But I'm at the store and this has been the Money Zone.

21:02.560 --> 21:04.560
So back to chocoroons.

21:04.560 --> 21:06.560
So someone stole this piece of pizza.

21:06.560 --> 21:11.560
Guys, we literally can't snack the entire show.

21:11.560 --> 21:15.560
Yeah, that's going to keep you.

21:15.560 --> 21:17.560
I'm 48 pounds overweight.

21:17.560 --> 21:21.560
This is what's been stopping me the entire time.

21:21.560 --> 21:24.560
Travis said I'm going to hit you with a one-two punch.

21:24.560 --> 21:28.560
If only someone had moved the snacks one inch out of my reach.

21:28.560 --> 21:32.560
Travis will push it out of reach and I'll do cookie points.

21:32.560 --> 21:35.560
And then that will be Bradley Cooper.

21:35.560 --> 21:37.560
Griffin is trying to suggest that I lost cookie points.

21:37.560 --> 21:39.560
If you don't know, cookie points is official currency.

21:39.560 --> 21:41.560
I earn for eating salad or vegetables.

21:41.560 --> 21:44.560
That you can exchange like arcade tickets.

21:44.560 --> 21:46.560
Or cookies.

21:46.560 --> 21:50.560
Not cookies he gives me, but the right ability to eat cookies.

21:50.560 --> 21:56.560
And Griffin tried to tell me today that just because I got a muffin.

21:56.560 --> 21:58.560
Which is a tall cookie.

21:58.560 --> 22:01.560
Well, he said a muffin is a tall cookie.

22:01.560 --> 22:04.560
A chocolate chip muffin that you try to get.

22:04.560 --> 22:09.560
Yeah, it's like taking a cookie and making it grow.

22:09.560 --> 22:12.560
We've been off topic for 15 minutes.

22:12.560 --> 22:15.560
All right, pizza thief.

22:15.560 --> 22:17.560
Pizza thief, pizza thief.

22:17.560 --> 22:19.560
Should you confront the person?

22:19.560 --> 22:24.560
Do you know how many pizzas you'd have to give me to confront anybody about anything?

22:24.560 --> 22:27.560
I saw a story on Dayline about people who were using Find My Phone.

22:27.560 --> 22:29.560
The app on your phone.

22:29.560 --> 22:32.560
That you can find your phone with it.

22:32.560 --> 22:34.560
And people will get their shit stole.

22:34.560 --> 22:36.560
And then will find their phone.

22:36.560 --> 22:38.560
And by which I mean the person who stole their phone.

22:38.560 --> 22:41.560
Who would then kill them.

22:41.560 --> 22:42.560
Sometimes.

22:42.560 --> 22:44.560
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

22:44.560 --> 22:48.560
The person finding their phone kills the person who took their phone.

22:48.560 --> 22:49.560
Or the person?

22:49.560 --> 22:50.560
No.

22:50.560 --> 22:53.560
What he's saying is like someone steals my shit.

22:53.560 --> 22:56.560
All of a sudden I'm going to deputize myself.

22:56.560 --> 22:59.560
Now I'm the equalizer.

22:59.560 --> 23:04.560
I'm going to go track down that fool and settle the score citizens arrest style.

23:04.560 --> 23:06.560
Pardon me, sir.

23:06.560 --> 23:08.560
You wronged me earlier.

23:08.560 --> 23:10.560
I demand satisfaction.

23:10.560 --> 23:13.560
Please lie down on the ground until the authorities are...

23:13.560 --> 23:15.560
Now what is that you have there?

23:15.560 --> 23:17.560
Is that a gun?

23:17.560 --> 23:19.560
Interesting.

23:19.560 --> 23:23.560
But you're implying that we would be afraid of confronting this pizza thief as the pizza thief.

23:23.560 --> 23:26.560
Rather than going to prison for stealing your pizza would kill you.

23:26.560 --> 23:31.560
A pizza costs $5 at Little Caesars.

23:31.560 --> 23:38.560
Do you think a person ordered a $5 hot and ready to be brought to their home?

23:38.560 --> 23:40.560
What kind of life are you living?

23:40.560 --> 23:46.560
Listen, I don't want nothing fancy, but I also do need it raw.

23:46.560 --> 23:48.560
I'm a humble man.

23:48.560 --> 23:51.560
I'm saying a phone costs way more than a hot and ready.

23:51.560 --> 23:53.560
So why would you confront a person for pizza?

23:53.560 --> 23:55.560
Just get another pizza.

23:55.560 --> 23:57.560
Just get another pizza.

23:57.560 --> 24:01.560
How about you just start ordering pizzas for that apartment with a note saying,

24:01.560 --> 24:04.560
I think you need this more than I do.

24:04.560 --> 24:09.560
And just really shame them about like clearly you're on some hard time.

24:09.560 --> 24:11.560
The old guilt pizza.

24:11.560 --> 24:14.560
Do you know what the best type of pizza on earth is?

24:14.560 --> 24:16.560
Pepperoni's in shame.

24:16.560 --> 24:18.560
No.

24:18.560 --> 24:20.560
It's Fritza, which is free pizza.

24:20.560 --> 24:24.560
And you need to just appreciate the fact that you are giving these people a wonderful and beautiful pizza.

24:24.560 --> 24:26.560
That you can't give yourself.

24:26.560 --> 24:28.560
That's a great point.

24:28.560 --> 24:32.560
You could pay for a pizza with money that someone else gave you.

24:32.560 --> 24:34.560
It would never be as delicious.

24:34.560 --> 24:37.560
Even if you're not taking a net loss is what I'm saying.

24:37.560 --> 24:39.560
Pay it forward and pay it forward the movie.

24:39.560 --> 24:43.560
Which we reference a lot, but it's a fucking incredible movie.

24:43.560 --> 24:45.560
It's a movie we will see at some point.

24:45.560 --> 24:47.560
I promise you we'll actually watch it.

24:47.560 --> 24:49.560
I saw it in theaters.

24:49.560 --> 24:52.560
Caleb Joel Osment buys three people, three pizzas.

24:52.560 --> 24:55.560
And then it gets stabbed in the stomach and dies.

24:57.560 --> 24:59.560
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

24:59.560 --> 25:01.560
No, really, yeah.

25:01.560 --> 25:03.560
Does the second part actually happen?

25:03.560 --> 25:05.560
The pizza part?

25:05.560 --> 25:07.560
Why would that be a movie?

25:07.560 --> 25:09.560
They just stab a little kid?

25:09.560 --> 25:11.560
Yep.

25:11.560 --> 25:13.560
Sorry, it was other little kids.

25:13.560 --> 25:15.560
It wasn't like an adult stabbing a little kid.

25:15.560 --> 25:17.560
But yeah, he definitely gets stabbed in the stomach.

25:17.560 --> 25:19.560
Why?

25:19.560 --> 25:21.560
He was paying it forward and shit.

25:21.560 --> 25:23.560
Listen, some people don't want that.

25:23.560 --> 25:25.560
Some people are like, pay it backward.

25:27.560 --> 25:29.560
How about you pay off the people that did shit for you?

25:29.560 --> 25:31.560
Yeah.

25:31.560 --> 25:33.560
You owe them money?

25:33.560 --> 25:37.560
He tried to say, oh my god, are we going to fucking go over the entire thought of pizza?

25:37.560 --> 25:39.560
Everybody talk amongst yourselves.

25:39.560 --> 25:41.560
I don't know if I got bored for Justin Roeper.

25:41.560 --> 25:43.560
So here's what happened.

25:43.560 --> 25:47.560
He was trying to stop these bullies from picking on his friend.

25:47.560 --> 25:49.560
And it was the one he put off until the end.

25:49.560 --> 25:51.560
So he rode his bike and said, I'm going to get you.

25:51.560 --> 25:55.560
But then he had a knife and they stabbed him in the stomach.

25:55.560 --> 25:57.560
And Kevin Spacey was there.

25:57.560 --> 25:59.560
He watched the whole thing and didn't do any.

25:59.560 --> 26:01.560
Cool job, K-Pax.

26:03.560 --> 26:07.560
I don't know how you return from that in this movie.

26:07.560 --> 26:09.560
It's the end of the movie, Justin.

26:09.560 --> 26:11.560
Fuck me.

26:13.560 --> 26:15.560
It's not like they end it.

26:15.560 --> 26:17.560
He gets stabbed and they're like, well, that sucks, Bailey.

26:17.560 --> 26:23.560
What happened is, as Haley was dying, he grabbed Kevin Spacey's shirt and said, pay it forward.

26:23.560 --> 26:25.560
And then Kevin Spacey stabbed the three bullies.

26:25.560 --> 26:27.560
He went, one, two, three, done.

26:31.560 --> 26:33.560
And now Haley, you pay it.

26:33.560 --> 26:35.560
Ah, fuck.

26:35.560 --> 26:37.560
I should have taken you to the hospital.

26:37.560 --> 26:39.560
I'm the worst dad ever.

26:39.560 --> 26:41.560
I want to say something to you.

26:41.560 --> 26:43.560
I have six podcasts to record today.

26:43.560 --> 26:47.560
I'm legitimately bummed out about this movie.

26:47.560 --> 26:51.560
I saw it in theaters when I was like 11.

26:51.560 --> 26:53.560
That explains a lot.

26:53.560 --> 26:55.560
Can we get like another, a whole other...

26:55.560 --> 26:57.560
Whole other subject.

26:57.560 --> 26:59.560
Is there another...

26:59.560 --> 27:01.560
Who wants to...

27:01.560 --> 27:05.560
Have the first person say, I'm going to pay this forward.

27:05.560 --> 27:07.560
I'm going to not tell anybody to watch this.

27:07.560 --> 27:09.560
I'm going to tell nobody this is in the theater.

27:09.560 --> 27:11.560
I'll pay it forward.

27:11.560 --> 27:13.560
He was very antagonistic.

27:13.560 --> 27:15.560
It was one of those things where he gets stabbed and you're like, oh, it's a kid.

27:15.560 --> 27:17.560
I get it.

27:17.560 --> 27:19.560
Fucking great.

27:19.560 --> 27:21.560
This is the Haley Joel thing that starts the pay it forward movement, right?

27:21.560 --> 27:23.560
Am I missing something about that?

27:23.560 --> 27:25.560
Pay it forward movement.

27:25.560 --> 27:27.560
Oh, we have to move on.

27:27.560 --> 27:29.560
We have to move it forward.

27:29.560 --> 27:35.560
Hey everybody, we want to take a quick break from the live action to provide you with this important...

27:35.560 --> 27:37.560
It's not live though, is it?

27:37.560 --> 27:39.560
Well, I mean, it was live when we made it.

27:39.560 --> 27:41.560
Now it's not live anymore.

27:41.560 --> 27:43.560
Now it's dead as fuck.

27:43.560 --> 27:49.560
It's dead as disco, Griffin, but we still wanted to take a moment for the Money Zone to tell you about Simple.

27:49.560 --> 27:51.560
Simple is the way banking should be.

27:51.560 --> 27:55.560
Take everything you know about banking and flush it down the fucking toilet.

27:55.560 --> 27:59.560
Like a bill info turd.

27:59.560 --> 28:01.560
Simple doesn't even use money.

28:01.560 --> 28:03.560
What does it use?

28:03.560 --> 28:05.560
Cookie points?

28:05.560 --> 28:07.560
It uses cookie points.

28:07.560 --> 28:09.560
It's the internet's premier cookie point transaction facility.

28:09.560 --> 28:11.560
Well, they don't actually use money for some stuff.

28:11.560 --> 28:13.560
You don't have to have a minimum balance.

28:13.560 --> 28:15.560
There's no monthly fee.

28:15.560 --> 28:17.560
There's no overdraft charges.

28:17.560 --> 28:23.560
And you can use over 55,000 ATMs around the globe for free.

28:23.560 --> 28:25.560
You can deposit your checks also by taking a picture of them.

28:25.560 --> 28:27.560
I like that.

28:27.560 --> 28:29.560
But I'm bad with money.

28:29.560 --> 28:33.560
Can Simple yell at me when I try to spend too much money on dumb shit?

28:33.560 --> 28:35.560
Hey, dummy.

28:35.560 --> 28:37.560
I want to help you reach your goals.

28:37.560 --> 28:39.560
It's like tough love.

28:39.560 --> 28:41.560
You tell how much you want to save and it'll tell you how much you can spend on fun shit.

28:41.560 --> 28:43.560
And you'll still have money to pay for the bills.

28:43.560 --> 28:45.560
And save your money.

28:45.560 --> 28:49.560
Set one up for your max fun contribution, it says here.

28:49.560 --> 28:51.560
So you can just put that aside.

28:51.560 --> 28:53.560
And maybe set that number to 1,000.

28:53.560 --> 28:55.560
Maybe jack that up because you're so Simple rich.

28:55.560 --> 28:57.560
Because you did Simple good.

28:57.560 --> 28:59.560
You can pay your bills super fast.

28:59.560 --> 29:03.560
Is this a fake one that's going to take all the money that I have from me?

29:03.560 --> 29:05.560
I know why you would think that.

29:05.560 --> 29:07.560
But you're wrong.

29:07.560 --> 29:09.560
They're an actual real ass company.

29:09.560 --> 29:11.560
And your account's FDIC insured.

29:11.560 --> 29:13.560
And they don't sell your data.

29:13.560 --> 29:15.560
And it's all very good.

29:15.560 --> 29:19.560
Now, the Simple.com is popping off so hard that they have like a wait list to get in it.

29:19.560 --> 29:21.560
To get onto it.

29:21.560 --> 29:23.560
But you can skip that.

29:23.560 --> 29:25.560
Sorry, we're full.

29:25.560 --> 29:27.560
We only got room for chicks.

29:27.560 --> 29:29.560
I know the McElroy brothers.

29:29.560 --> 29:31.560
So I can get in for free.

29:31.560 --> 29:33.560
Oh, come on in then.

29:33.560 --> 29:35.560
Simple.com slash my brother.

29:35.560 --> 29:37.560
Let me do my bit.

29:37.560 --> 29:39.560
Let me do my bouncer bit.

29:39.560 --> 29:41.560
Okay, finish the bouncer bit.

29:41.560 --> 29:43.560
I thought it was done.

29:43.560 --> 29:45.560
Come on in then.

29:45.560 --> 29:47.560
Simple.com slash my brother.

29:47.560 --> 29:49.560
Okay, let's talk about Squarespace.

29:49.560 --> 29:53.560
Yes, two different people listened to this and said, yeah, let's give them money to talk about us.

29:53.560 --> 29:59.560
Squarespace is the all-in-one platform that makes it fast and easy to create your own professional website or online portfolio.

29:59.560 --> 30:01.560
Listen, you've heard us talk about Squarespace a lot.

30:01.560 --> 30:03.560
They've been chopping and screwing it.

30:03.560 --> 30:05.560
Improving it.

30:05.560 --> 30:07.560
They got new designs, new features, even better support.

30:07.560 --> 30:11.560
They have beautiful designs for you to start with if you're a dummy and don't know how to website.

30:11.560 --> 30:16.560
If you're not a dummy and you do know how to website, you can take those designs and chop and screw them even more.

30:16.560 --> 30:21.560
To create a bespoke website of your own bespoking.

30:21.560 --> 30:23.560
This sounds amazing, Griffin.

30:23.560 --> 30:25.560
It is fucking amazing.

30:25.560 --> 30:27.560
It's expensive though, right?

30:27.560 --> 30:29.560
It's not expensive.

30:29.560 --> 30:31.560
It costs dollars a month.

30:31.560 --> 30:33.560
Eight dollars a month.

30:33.560 --> 30:36.560
And you get a free domain name if you sign up for a year with that.

30:36.560 --> 30:38.560
So do it.

30:38.560 --> 30:40.560
They have responsive design.

30:40.560 --> 30:42.560
It'll work on all your products.

30:42.560 --> 30:44.560
You can start without a credit card.

30:44.560 --> 30:46.560
You can just do a free trial.

30:46.560 --> 30:48.560
Go to squarespace.com and use the offer code MYBROTHER.

30:48.560 --> 30:50.560

30:52.560 --> 30:54.560

30:54.560 --> 30:56.560
That's Squarespace.

30:56.560 --> 30:58.560
Check it out, you dummy.

30:58.560 --> 31:00.560
I got a personal message here.

31:00.560 --> 31:02.560
To Lisa from Don.

31:02.560 --> 31:06.560
Don says May 26th is our third or fourth wedding anniversary.

31:06.560 --> 31:08.560
Pretty close.

31:08.560 --> 31:10.560
Pretty good job.

31:10.560 --> 31:12.560
And May 31st is Lisa's 28th birthday.

31:12.560 --> 31:18.560
Happy birthday and happy anniversary from your sweet, sweet husband.

31:18.560 --> 31:20.560
Your pup, Jonas.

31:20.560 --> 31:22.560
Your kitty, Blueberry.

31:22.560 --> 31:24.560
And your favorite trio of podcasting brothers.

31:24.560 --> 31:28.560
Travis, a sad lib would really make her day.

31:28.560 --> 31:30.560
Sorry, Travis is dead.

31:30.560 --> 31:32.560
That's why he's not here.

31:32.560 --> 31:34.560
He's not dead. Don't say that.

31:34.560 --> 31:36.560
Travis will never die.

31:36.560 --> 31:38.560
He's got the secret diet that keeps you alive forever.

31:38.560 --> 31:40.560
Happy birthday, Lisa.

31:40.560 --> 31:42.560
Sorry we couldn't Travis you.

31:42.560 --> 31:44.560
But I don't know where that fool is.

31:44.560 --> 31:46.560
Have you heard from him today?

31:46.560 --> 31:48.560
Nah.

31:48.560 --> 31:50.560
I got a message to Henry and Allie from...

31:50.560 --> 31:52.560
Should have read this ahead of time.

31:52.560 --> 31:54.560
Tilda Swinton's pussy and associates.

31:54.560 --> 31:56.560
Is that a callback?

31:56.560 --> 31:58.560
I hope we haven't talked about that.

31:58.560 --> 32:00.560
Salutations.

32:00.560 --> 32:02.560
Yael's wedding was the blast of blast.

32:02.560 --> 32:04.560
You two are simply the best two people that we know.

32:04.560 --> 32:06.560
And we are so happy for you.

32:06.560 --> 32:08.560
Now go and get to work on growing your cat harem.

32:08.560 --> 32:10.560
Because buddy told us you wanted friends.

32:10.560 --> 32:12.560
Here's hoping the goofball reading this

32:12.560 --> 32:14.560
pronounce your names goofily.

32:14.560 --> 32:16.560
It's Henry and Allie.

32:16.560 --> 32:18.560
How we can fuck up Henry and Allie.

32:18.560 --> 32:20.560
I fucked up the grammar of that sentence.

32:20.560 --> 32:22.560
I said how we can fuck up.

32:22.560 --> 32:24.560
So even I fucked that up I can't fuck up that name.

32:24.560 --> 32:26.560
Henry.

32:26.560 --> 32:28.560
Sorry. Henry.

32:28.560 --> 32:30.560
Anyway guys, good job.

32:30.560 --> 32:32.560
Good job getting married.

32:32.560 --> 32:34.560
Big thanks to everybody who came out to the live shows too.

32:34.560 --> 32:36.560
We're going to spread them out probably a little bit.

32:36.560 --> 32:38.560
Is the first one.

32:38.560 --> 32:40.560
They all went super well.

32:40.560 --> 32:42.560
I feel like we met everybody at all three shows.

32:42.560 --> 32:44.560
And you were all super fucking cool.

32:44.560 --> 32:46.560
We'll have to do it again real soon.

32:46.560 --> 32:48.560
Because I'm turning the corner on New York City.

32:48.560 --> 32:50.560
I actually think it's a nice place to be.

32:50.560 --> 32:52.560
As opposed to just like a trap that you fly into

32:52.560 --> 32:54.560
and then you can't fly out of.

32:54.560 --> 32:56.560
The Bermuda Triangle.

32:56.560 --> 32:58.560
It's the Bermuda Triangle, yes.

32:58.560 --> 33:00.560
Of cities. But actually it's pretty tight.

33:00.560 --> 33:02.560
They got real good Korean food there.

33:02.560 --> 33:04.560
Oh boy.

33:04.560 --> 33:06.560
That's a story for another time.

33:06.560 --> 33:08.560
Anyway, thanks for listening.

33:08.560 --> 33:10.560
We'll get back to the live show now.

33:10.560 --> 33:12.560
This Yahoo answer was...

33:12.560 --> 33:14.560
Oh, I'm going to fuck this name right up.

33:14.560 --> 33:16.560
You want to try this one?

33:16.560 --> 33:18.560
You never are in this position of having to try it.

33:18.560 --> 33:20.560
How do I know?

33:20.560 --> 33:22.560
Ivica Fulnovic.

33:22.560 --> 33:24.560
Better than nothing.

33:24.560 --> 33:26.560
It's asked by Yahoo answers user

33:26.560 --> 33:28.560
Grand Duchess Anast.

33:28.560 --> 33:30.560
Who asked...

33:30.560 --> 33:32.560
Have you ever heard of the

33:32.560 --> 33:34.560
McDizzle at McDonald's?

33:36.560 --> 33:38.560
I have heard of it and only one of my friends

33:38.560 --> 33:40.560
have heard of it. Do you know?

33:42.560 --> 33:46.560
I love the conversational Yahoo is the best.

33:46.560 --> 33:48.560
Hey, did you guys know about this?

33:48.560 --> 33:50.560
Yeah, that's just typed on screen.

33:50.560 --> 33:52.560
This...

33:52.560 --> 33:54.560
This fucking Yahoo Knights mystery

33:54.560 --> 33:56.560
sent me down such

33:56.560 --> 33:58.560
a rabbit hole.

33:58.560 --> 34:00.560
Because there are

34:00.560 --> 34:02.560
secret orders online

34:02.560 --> 34:04.560
who assure you

34:04.560 --> 34:06.560
that there exists a McDonald's secret menu.

34:06.560 --> 34:08.560
Much like In-N-Out.

34:08.560 --> 34:10.560
Much like Peteri's and so many

34:10.560 --> 34:12.560
other chain fast food restaurants.

34:12.560 --> 34:14.560
Is the argument, is the conceit

34:14.560 --> 34:16.560
here that like, among the

34:16.560 --> 34:18.560
absolute baseline

34:18.560 --> 34:20.560
level training that a McDonald's employee receives

34:20.560 --> 34:22.560
there is another level that

34:22.560 --> 34:24.560
they have to come in on Saturday

34:24.560 --> 34:26.560
to learn the secret menu know-it-all?

34:26.560 --> 34:28.560
We're not talking about if you can't get a pasta

34:28.560 --> 34:30.560
we're talking about taking their garbage food

34:30.560 --> 34:32.560
and making it into other garbage.

34:36.560 --> 34:38.560
Let's start with for instance...

34:38.560 --> 34:40.560
Make it worse.

34:44.560 --> 34:46.560
Was that Tim Gunn

34:46.560 --> 34:48.560
or Jean-Luc Picard?

34:52.560 --> 34:54.560
I couldn't tell you.

34:54.560 --> 34:56.560
I couldn't tell you.

34:56.560 --> 34:58.560
We'll start with the poor man's Big Mac.

34:58.560 --> 35:00.560
And this is a secret menu...

35:00.560 --> 35:02.560
What's the rich man's Big Mac?

35:04.560 --> 35:06.560
Burn.

35:06.560 --> 35:08.560
Take that, Ollie.

35:10.560 --> 35:12.560
Oh man.

35:12.560 --> 35:14.560
The beginning sentence of that

35:14.560 --> 35:16.560
is my favorite.

35:16.560 --> 35:18.560
Who doesn't love Big Mac?

35:18.560 --> 35:20.560
A lot of people actually...

35:20.560 --> 35:22.560
But not everyone loves its price.

35:22.560 --> 35:24.560
Yeah. How much?

35:24.560 --> 35:26.560
35 cents.

35:26.560 --> 35:28.560
So if you want to get something

35:28.560 --> 35:30.560
close to Big Mac without paying the full price

35:30.560 --> 35:32.560
what you can do is order a McDouble

35:32.560 --> 35:34.560
but remove the ketchup and pickles.

35:34.560 --> 35:36.560
Instead, ask for extra onions, lettuce

35:36.560 --> 35:38.560
and a Big Mac sauce.

35:38.560 --> 35:40.560
It tastes almost the same because of the absence

35:40.560 --> 35:42.560
of the sesame seed buns and a slice of cheese.

35:42.560 --> 35:44.560
You can get

35:44.560 --> 35:46.560
at least three of these secret

35:46.560 --> 35:48.560
secret budget Big Mac

35:48.560 --> 35:50.560
for the price of a Big Mac.

35:50.560 --> 35:52.560
I want you all to picture the face

35:52.560 --> 35:54.560
of the McDonald's employee when you go

35:54.560 --> 35:56.560
I want a McDonald's but hold on.

35:56.560 --> 35:58.560
Before you start making a McDouble.

35:58.560 --> 36:00.560
I want a McDouble.

36:00.560 --> 36:02.560
But hold on.

36:02.560 --> 36:04.560
Here's the thing. I'm going to chop it and screw it up.

36:04.560 --> 36:06.560
I'm talking after onions.

36:06.560 --> 36:08.560
I'm just going to hand you

36:08.560 --> 36:10.560
this pre-made McDouble.

36:10.560 --> 36:12.560
You take this and you leave.

36:12.560 --> 36:14.560
And I go back.

36:14.560 --> 36:16.560
They may not

36:16.560 --> 36:18.560
be on to the game until

36:18.560 --> 36:20.560
you say and um

36:20.560 --> 36:22.560
Big Mac with sauce.

36:22.560 --> 36:24.560
It's like um

36:24.560 --> 36:26.560
an extra one of those

36:26.560 --> 36:28.560
and give me those and

36:28.560 --> 36:30.560
Big Mac sauce.

36:30.560 --> 36:32.560
Maybe you just have

36:32.560 --> 36:34.560
I mean if you have them.

36:34.560 --> 36:36.560
I heard it's just Dallas, Mildred and Jackson.

36:36.560 --> 36:38.560
How about

36:38.560 --> 36:40.560
oh this is fucking the worst.

36:40.560 --> 36:42.560
This one can't be

36:42.560 --> 36:44.560
This one can't be something that you just say.

36:44.560 --> 36:46.560
It has to be

36:46.560 --> 36:48.560
you're a piece of shit.

36:48.560 --> 36:50.560
And then you fucking

36:50.560 --> 36:52.560
sloppy handed Guy Fieri

36:52.560 --> 36:54.560
at the sad McDonald's table

36:54.560 --> 36:56.560
like

36:56.560 --> 36:58.560
This is the

36:58.560 --> 37:00.560
McBland sea and air burger.

37:04.560 --> 37:06.560
Captain Planet may have been a thing in the 90s

37:06.560 --> 37:08.560
but this burger is like the powers

37:08.560 --> 37:10.560
of Captain Planet.

37:10.560 --> 37:12.560
This burger is like the powers of

37:12.560 --> 37:14.560
Captain Planet combined.

37:16.560 --> 37:18.560
I don't think diarrhea

37:18.560 --> 37:20.560
was one of the elements of a

37:22.560 --> 37:24.560
Imagine eating a hamburger

37:24.560 --> 37:26.560
and the chicken, sure.

37:26.560 --> 37:28.560
And the filet of fish, sure. All in once.

37:28.560 --> 37:30.560
Fuck you.

37:30.560 --> 37:32.560
So yeah.

37:32.560 --> 37:34.560
Epic burger is epic. There's a picture.

37:34.560 --> 37:36.560
It's the

37:36.560 --> 37:38.560
Oh God.

37:38.560 --> 37:40.560
Anyone like to come up and see the picture?

37:40.560 --> 37:42.560
No.

37:42.560 --> 37:44.560
Jesus Christ.

37:44.560 --> 37:46.560
Let's talk about the McCrape recipe.

37:46.560 --> 37:48.560
McDonald's has crepes?

37:48.560 --> 37:50.560
Kind of.

37:50.560 --> 37:52.560
I'm not sure you're pronouncing

37:52.560 --> 37:54.560
McCrape properly.

37:56.560 --> 37:58.560
And then we went for some French breakfast.

37:58.560 --> 38:00.560
Why did you go to McDonald's then?

38:02.560 --> 38:04.560
I went to McDonald's but I want something

38:04.560 --> 38:06.560
with an international flair.

38:06.560 --> 38:08.560
I considered both a breakfast and a dessert.

38:10.560 --> 38:12.560
And a thing, apparently. That exists.

38:12.560 --> 38:14.560
This secret menu item will allow you

38:14.560 --> 38:16.560
to eat crepe McDonald's style.

38:16.560 --> 38:18.560
Just like you've always wanted to.

38:20.560 --> 38:22.560
You guys have done such a great job

38:22.560 --> 38:24.560
with chicken and hamburgers.

38:24.560 --> 38:26.560
What I was wondering is...

38:26.560 --> 38:28.560
Maybe a crepe?

38:28.560 --> 38:30.560
Just or Mr. McDonald's hot cakes

38:30.560 --> 38:32.560
because they're extremely delicious.

38:32.560 --> 38:34.560
I didn't make that up. That's on here.

38:34.560 --> 38:36.560
I'm not sharing the treats.

38:36.560 --> 38:38.560
I'm writing it to you right now.

38:38.560 --> 38:40.560
That's the person.

38:40.560 --> 38:42.560
Then buy a yogurt parfait.

38:42.560 --> 38:44.560
Simply put the yogurt inside the pancake

38:44.560 --> 38:46.560
and wrap it up like a crepe.

38:46.560 --> 38:48.560
Top the pancake with fruit, granola,

38:48.560 --> 38:50.560
and optional syrup.

38:50.560 --> 38:52.560
That's it. You have your own homemade

38:52.560 --> 38:54.560
slightly-eaten McCrape.

38:54.560 --> 38:56.560
You laugh but right now there's a guy

38:56.560 --> 38:58.560
at Taco Bell like...

39:00.560 --> 39:02.560
Here's the thing.

39:02.560 --> 39:04.560
That's not a crepe.

39:04.560 --> 39:06.560
That makes it a fucking pancake with shit inside.

39:06.560 --> 39:08.560
That's a sloppy boy.

39:08.560 --> 39:10.560
That does not change it from a pancake to a crepe.

39:10.560 --> 39:12.560
It's just like a crepe.

39:12.560 --> 39:14.560
No.

39:14.560 --> 39:16.560
It looks like dump.

39:18.560 --> 39:20.560
It really does look like puke.

39:20.560 --> 39:22.560
In a pancake.

39:22.560 --> 39:24.560
Welcome to our show.

39:24.560 --> 39:26.560
We talk about pictures you can't see.

39:26.560 --> 39:28.560
No, we're painting work pictures.

39:28.560 --> 39:30.560
It looks like if you jammed

39:30.560 --> 39:32.560
oats and a hand grenade

39:32.560 --> 39:34.560
inside a pajama.

39:34.560 --> 39:36.560
It's what it looks like.

39:36.560 --> 39:38.560
How's that?

39:38.560 --> 39:40.560
But now you know what it is.

39:40.560 --> 39:42.560
We can go on.

39:42.560 --> 39:44.560
There's a Mc10-35.

39:44.560 --> 39:46.560
Half breakfast, half lunch items.

39:48.560 --> 39:50.560
Just keep that in mind

39:50.560 --> 39:52.560
next time. Just say I want a Big McChicken.

39:52.560 --> 39:54.560
It's a triple down basically.

39:56.560 --> 39:58.560
Now wait. I have a question for you.

39:58.560 --> 40:00.560
How do you do onus and not

40:00.560 --> 40:02.560
address the McNizzle?

40:02.560 --> 40:04.560
Oh, it doesn't exist.

40:12.560 --> 40:14.560
I think it's not real.

40:14.560 --> 40:16.560
You guys want to take some audience questions?

40:16.560 --> 40:18.560
Yeah, we can start that.

40:18.560 --> 40:20.560
Who has a question that's good?

40:20.560 --> 40:22.560
Justin, do you want to point them out

40:22.560 --> 40:24.560
so the whole onus is on you?

40:24.560 --> 40:26.560
Do you want to point out the people?

40:26.560 --> 40:28.560
Sir, right here. Come on down.

40:28.560 --> 40:30.560
Come on down.

40:34.560 --> 40:36.560
I apologize you

40:36.560 --> 40:38.560
aren't going to get the best view of this show

40:38.560 --> 40:40.560
but we'll get you back.

40:40.560 --> 40:42.560
What's your answer?

40:42.560 --> 40:44.560
I'm Marco.

40:44.560 --> 40:46.560
Marco, is this a good question?

40:48.560 --> 40:50.560
No, I don't think it's a bummer question.

40:50.560 --> 40:52.560
Oh, hold on.

40:52.560 --> 40:54.560
There was a second half of it.

40:54.560 --> 40:56.560
I don't think it's a bummer question.

40:56.560 --> 40:58.560
Last time we did a live show we had people come up

40:58.560 --> 41:00.560
and be like, oh, no, it's great, it's great, it's great.

41:00.560 --> 41:02.560
Girlfriend just laughed at me and...

41:02.560 --> 41:04.560
All right, Marco.

41:04.560 --> 41:06.560
All right, so I'm the oldest of four

41:06.560 --> 41:10.560
and I've always gotten along fine with my siblings.

41:10.560 --> 41:12.560
I don't have a whole lot in common with them.

41:12.560 --> 41:14.560
They're more like super into sports.

41:14.560 --> 41:16.560
Yeah.

41:16.560 --> 41:18.560
But now we're all getting to be grownups

41:18.560 --> 41:20.560
and I feel like

41:20.560 --> 41:22.560
there are so many families that have

41:22.560 --> 41:24.560
so much tight sibling bonding.

41:24.560 --> 41:28.560
How do I get to be friends with my siblings?

41:28.560 --> 41:30.560
It's easy.

41:30.560 --> 41:32.560
You've got to find financial incentives.

41:32.560 --> 41:34.560
Start a podcast so you can pay the bills.

41:36.560 --> 41:38.560
I mean, before we had the podcast

41:38.560 --> 41:40.560
it was sports for us.

41:40.560 --> 41:42.560
All sports, 24-step.

41:42.560 --> 41:44.560
So you have three brothers?

41:44.560 --> 41:46.560
One sister, two brothers.

41:46.560 --> 41:48.560
One sister, two brothers.

41:48.560 --> 41:50.560
Are all three of them into sports?

41:50.560 --> 41:52.560
Yeah, she's like a business school

41:52.560 --> 41:54.560
marketing kind of person.

41:54.560 --> 41:56.560
Just kind of like pop culture.

41:56.560 --> 41:58.560
Which one's your favorite?

41:58.560 --> 42:00.560
Which one's my best?

42:00.560 --> 42:02.560
You can be honest.

42:02.560 --> 42:04.560
She sounds like the best.

42:04.560 --> 42:06.560
Your brothers are into sports.

42:06.560 --> 42:08.560
Okay, so it sounds like I've figured out the problem, Marco.

42:08.560 --> 42:10.560
You're the odd dog.

42:10.560 --> 42:12.560
You're the odd man out.

42:12.560 --> 42:14.560
You've got to realign everything

42:14.560 --> 42:16.560
you think is worthwhile and valuable.

42:16.560 --> 42:20.560
You've got to stop liking the things you like

42:20.560 --> 42:22.560
and like the things you hate.

42:22.560 --> 42:24.560
But if you can teach yourself to do that

42:24.560 --> 42:26.560
you have given yourself the ability

42:26.560 --> 42:28.560
to like everything in the world.

42:28.560 --> 42:30.560
Love me.

42:30.560 --> 42:32.560
Should we cancel the show now?

42:34.560 --> 42:36.560
Was that it?

42:36.560 --> 42:38.560
Was that everything?

42:38.560 --> 42:40.560
You could get a really specific sports knowledge.

42:40.560 --> 42:42.560
I think that's a good...

42:42.560 --> 42:44.560
You pick one team...

42:44.560 --> 42:46.560
You have a really great highlight.

42:46.560 --> 42:48.560
If you get deep into a sports

42:48.560 --> 42:50.560
well that they have no knowledge of

42:50.560 --> 42:52.560
they will just assume you have a base level

42:52.560 --> 42:54.560
of sports knowledge.

42:54.560 --> 42:56.560
You can build off that.

42:56.560 --> 42:58.560
The onus then becomes on them.

42:58.560 --> 43:00.560
They're in the highlight, just like you.

43:00.560 --> 43:02.560
That's a great plan until the first time

43:02.560 --> 43:04.560
you try to watch a football game with them

43:04.560 --> 43:06.560
and they're like touchdown!

43:06.560 --> 43:08.560
So basically, Justin, your advice sounds like

43:08.560 --> 43:10.560
what you should do is instead of

43:10.560 --> 43:12.560
alienating his brothers and sister

43:12.560 --> 43:14.560
because he's not in the sports

43:14.560 --> 43:16.560
he should alienate them by being into a sport

43:16.560 --> 43:18.560
they know nothing about.

43:18.560 --> 43:20.560
The numbers aren't in your favor right now.

43:20.560 --> 43:22.560
In this family game

43:22.560 --> 43:24.560
you're losing 3-1.

43:24.560 --> 43:26.560
Maybe you pick a specific sportsman

43:26.560 --> 43:28.560
to get super into.

43:28.560 --> 43:30.560
And you try to inject him

43:30.560 --> 43:32.560
into every sports conversation.

43:32.560 --> 43:34.560
Yeah, Jordan's great.

43:34.560 --> 43:36.560
He's no Flick Rickleson.

43:36.560 --> 43:38.560
Flick Rickleson, you know her?

43:38.560 --> 43:40.560
This man can hook a ball at a wall

43:40.560 --> 43:42.560
and another man will catch it.

43:42.560 --> 43:44.560
How does highlight work?

43:44.560 --> 43:46.560
I just know the ball travels extremely fast.

43:46.560 --> 43:48.560
Some are scoops and then concussions.

43:48.560 --> 43:50.560
Yeah, it's a very dangerous sport.

43:50.560 --> 43:52.560
So my advice would be that

43:52.560 --> 43:54.560
the desire to want to be close to them

43:54.560 --> 43:56.560
and get along with them seems to me

43:56.560 --> 43:58.560
like it would override everything else.

43:58.560 --> 44:00.560
And something like setting out and saying

44:00.560 --> 44:02.560
I'm going to make this work because

44:02.560 --> 44:04.560
it is important to me, I'm going to make it a priority

44:04.560 --> 44:06.560
is really all you need to do.

44:06.560 --> 44:08.560
Because everything else is just icing.

44:08.560 --> 44:10.560
But the relationships between you

44:10.560 --> 44:12.560
and your brothers and your sister

44:12.560 --> 44:14.560
is something that if you say this is a priority

44:14.560 --> 44:16.560
and I'm going to make this work

44:16.560 --> 44:18.560
and I'm going to stay close to them

44:18.560 --> 44:20.560
and become close to them, everything else is done.

44:20.560 --> 44:22.560
Some relationships take more work.

44:22.560 --> 44:24.560
Some of them are natural effects,

44:24.560 --> 44:26.560
like you just click with people.

44:26.560 --> 44:28.560
But if it's your family,

44:28.560 --> 44:30.560
then maybe you have to force it a little bit.

44:30.560 --> 44:32.560
I mean, really, yes, I hate these two.

44:32.560 --> 44:34.560
But you find the things...

44:34.560 --> 44:36.560
Interests don't have to be what you have in common.

44:36.560 --> 44:38.560
The common desire is wanting to get along.

44:38.560 --> 44:40.560
The common desire is wanting to be close.

44:40.560 --> 44:42.560
And then you build off of that and say,

44:42.560 --> 44:44.560
hey, I will go with you to see a football game

44:44.560 --> 44:46.560
and you come with me to see a weird live show

44:46.560 --> 44:48.560
where three dudes get up and talk about grenades and vagina.

44:48.560 --> 44:50.560
Talk about you.

44:50.560 --> 44:52.560
Talk about you.

44:52.560 --> 44:54.560
It'll be great.

44:54.560 --> 44:56.560
Does that help?

44:56.560 --> 44:58.560
Yeah. Thanks, Mark.

44:58.560 --> 45:00.560
Anybody else?

45:00.560 --> 45:02.560
Want to help?

45:02.560 --> 45:04.560
I saw the hand go first right there.

45:04.560 --> 45:06.560
Yes, stand up.

45:06.560 --> 45:08.560
Yes, yes, perfect.

45:08.560 --> 45:10.560
Come on down.

45:10.560 --> 45:12.560
Oh, boy.

45:12.560 --> 45:14.560
Oh, hello.

45:14.560 --> 45:16.560
Hey, everybody.

45:16.560 --> 45:18.560
It's your family friend, Laura Frye.

45:18.560 --> 45:20.560
You don't know Laura,

45:20.560 --> 45:22.560
but hey, everybody, it's Laura.

45:22.560 --> 45:24.560
Hello, Laura.

45:24.560 --> 45:26.560
Laura, how can we help?

45:26.560 --> 45:28.560
Laura, how can we help?

45:28.560 --> 45:30.560
Is it sad or about poop or...?

45:30.560 --> 45:32.560
Okay.

45:32.560 --> 45:34.560
So we are headed to the beach

45:34.560 --> 45:36.560
in a few weeks

45:36.560 --> 45:38.560
and we have a great friend who we love

45:38.560 --> 45:40.560
but who's going with us.

45:40.560 --> 45:42.560
Happens to be one of those friends, though,

45:42.560 --> 45:44.560
that every story you say,

45:44.560 --> 45:46.560
he possibly has one that tosses in.

45:46.560 --> 45:48.560
I mean, constantly.

45:48.560 --> 45:50.560
So how do we spend nine hours

45:50.560 --> 45:52.560
and not jump out of the car?

45:52.560 --> 45:54.560
Can you mouth his name to us

45:54.560 --> 45:56.560
if we know who he is so we just don't...

45:56.560 --> 45:58.560
Like, it won't come up.

45:58.560 --> 46:00.560
Oh, nobody from home.

46:00.560 --> 46:02.560
Nobody from H now.

46:02.560 --> 46:04.560
Can you top...

46:04.560 --> 46:06.560
Can you re-top?

46:06.560 --> 46:08.560
Can you re-top?

46:08.560 --> 46:10.560
Oh, yes, you can.

46:10.560 --> 46:12.560
Cool story.

46:12.560 --> 46:14.560
That made me remember another one

46:14.560 --> 46:16.560
that's even better

46:16.560 --> 46:18.560
than the one you told me just then.

46:18.560 --> 46:20.560
Like, maybe...

46:20.560 --> 46:22.560
And if he...

46:22.560 --> 46:24.560
If he does not realize

46:24.560 --> 46:26.560
that he is being

46:26.560 --> 46:28.560
inceptioned by the, like,

46:28.560 --> 46:30.560
third or fourth time...

46:30.560 --> 46:32.560
Cool thing, Greg.

46:32.560 --> 46:34.560
You know what? It's so funny that you said that

46:34.560 --> 46:36.560
again after the thing I said after the thing you said.

46:36.560 --> 46:38.560
Oh, no, shit!

46:38.560 --> 46:40.560
Tell your first story again!

46:40.560 --> 46:42.560
Like, that reminds me of a story!

46:42.560 --> 46:44.560
Drop your original one!

46:44.560 --> 46:46.560
Yes!

46:46.560 --> 46:48.560
But then he's going to do the same thing

46:48.560 --> 46:50.560
and then you will both die the whole day.

46:50.560 --> 46:52.560
What about...

46:52.560 --> 46:54.560
Turn on some tunes.

46:54.560 --> 46:56.560
Turn on some...

46:56.560 --> 46:58.560
Tell the most boring stories you can

46:58.560 --> 47:00.560
think of. Just really lob them

47:00.560 --> 47:02.560
like a slow ball, but on top of that, like,

47:02.560 --> 47:04.560
one time I ate a sandwich, like, nailed it.

47:04.560 --> 47:06.560
You got it.

47:06.560 --> 47:08.560
Don't put yourself

47:08.560 --> 47:10.560
in this situation.

47:10.560 --> 47:12.560
Do you have a car? Do you have a luggage rack?

47:14.560 --> 47:16.560
Can you put some peanut butter

47:16.560 --> 47:18.560
in his mouth?

47:18.560 --> 47:20.560
Is there gonna be a lot of

47:20.560 --> 47:22.560
peanut butter?

47:22.560 --> 47:24.560
How much peanut butter does it take?

47:24.560 --> 47:26.560
How much peanut butter does it take

47:26.560 --> 47:28.560
a man to eat nine hours?

47:28.560 --> 47:30.560
What's it, the cubic volume of a man's mouth?

47:30.560 --> 47:32.560
It's gonna look...

47:32.560 --> 47:34.560
By the end of the road trip, it's gonna look

47:34.560 --> 47:36.560
a little bit like Dumbledore in your backseat.

47:36.560 --> 47:38.560
I warn you.

47:38.560 --> 47:40.560
I don't remember what it was like.

47:40.560 --> 47:42.560
Did that help?

47:42.560 --> 47:44.560
So much.

47:44.560 --> 47:48.560
Is there anyone here?

47:48.560 --> 47:50.560
Do you want to write?

47:50.560 --> 47:52.560
Sorry?

47:52.560 --> 47:54.560
Anyone in?

47:54.560 --> 47:56.560
This guy who was sent in by Derek Engel.

47:56.560 --> 47:58.560
Thank you, Derek.

47:58.560 --> 48:00.560
It is by...

48:00.560 --> 48:02.560
Brandon Lambkin, you asked.

48:02.560 --> 48:04.560
Don't put your full name on the line.

48:06.560 --> 48:08.560
Is it okay to trim

48:08.560 --> 48:10.560
my dog's pubic hair?

48:10.560 --> 48:12.560
Guys,

48:12.560 --> 48:14.560
can we be delicate

48:14.560 --> 48:16.560
in the representation of an owl or a bee?

48:16.560 --> 48:18.560
Can we just help, please?

48:20.560 --> 48:22.560
I just got a dog

48:22.560 --> 48:24.560
for my fiancé, and it is about

48:24.560 --> 48:26.560
five to six months old.

48:26.560 --> 48:28.560
Dogs get pubes at five to six months old?

48:30.560 --> 48:32.560
A little intimidating.

48:32.560 --> 48:34.560
Yeah.

48:34.560 --> 48:36.560
When she rolls over, you can see

48:36.560 --> 48:40.560
extremely long pubic hair.

48:42.560 --> 48:44.560
Is it okay for me to trim it,

48:44.560 --> 48:46.560
or will it affect the dog?

48:46.560 --> 48:48.560
It'll affect the dog, probably.

48:50.560 --> 48:52.560
It will affect the dog's gait,

48:52.560 --> 48:54.560
I bet.

48:54.560 --> 48:56.560
And their general mood probs.

49:00.560 --> 49:02.560
Chaz, you worked at a kennel for a while,

49:02.560 --> 49:04.560
and I know that your specialty was

49:04.560 --> 49:06.560
to trim your ears.

49:06.560 --> 49:08.560
Okay, I was going to give them a fair warning.

49:08.560 --> 49:10.560
A spoiler warning, because it's going to

49:10.560 --> 49:12.560
spoil your day.

49:12.560 --> 49:14.560
I squeeze dog buttholes.

49:14.560 --> 49:16.560
I was known for it.

49:16.560 --> 49:18.560
Fastest hands in the West.

49:20.560 --> 49:22.560
There's a gland...

49:22.560 --> 49:24.560
I don't know why dogs...

49:24.560 --> 49:26.560
Hold on.

49:26.560 --> 49:28.560
Time out.

49:28.560 --> 49:30.560
There's a gland back there

49:30.560 --> 49:32.560
that makes stinky.

49:32.560 --> 49:34.560
Why do they need that in their life?

49:34.560 --> 49:36.560
Hey, you know how many awesome things

49:36.560 --> 49:38.560
I gave dogs?

49:38.560 --> 49:40.560
Check this out.

49:40.560 --> 49:42.560
We're going to balance it all out.

49:42.560 --> 49:44.560
Put a thing in their butthole,

49:44.560 --> 49:46.560
people are going to squeeze.

49:46.560 --> 49:48.560
Here's my question about dog pubes.

49:48.560 --> 49:50.560
I guess my question is...

49:50.560 --> 49:52.560
Talking about dog pubes now after that

49:52.560 --> 49:54.560
is weirdly refreshing.

49:54.560 --> 49:56.560
Is this person's concern

49:56.560 --> 49:58.560
if they don't trim these pubes?

49:58.560 --> 50:00.560
It's entirely aesthetic.

50:00.560 --> 50:02.560
Okay, great.

50:02.560 --> 50:04.560
I just don't want people to judge my dog's

50:04.560 --> 50:06.560
super long pubic hair.

50:06.560 --> 50:08.560
Have you seen Steve's dog's pubic hair?

50:08.560 --> 50:10.560
Jesus.

50:10.560 --> 50:12.560
They want to trim that shit.

50:12.560 --> 50:14.560
Got stuck on the wrong nose.

50:20.560 --> 50:22.560
I guess my question is...

50:22.560 --> 50:24.560
Where does that region

50:24.560 --> 50:26.560
end and begin?

50:26.560 --> 50:28.560
Is there a definitive...

50:28.560 --> 50:30.560
That's tummy hair.

50:30.560 --> 50:32.560
Tummy hair stops here.

50:32.560 --> 50:34.560
Look at that bush!

50:34.560 --> 50:36.560
I think you have to put a bikini

50:36.560 --> 50:38.560
on the dog.

50:48.560 --> 50:50.560
I guess the real question is,

50:50.560 --> 50:52.560
do you bleach their asses off?

50:52.560 --> 50:54.560
Travis!

50:54.560 --> 50:56.560
We were all thinking him.

50:56.560 --> 50:58.560
There's not a single person here.

50:58.560 --> 51:00.560
They will be asked to leave.

51:00.560 --> 51:02.560
Raise your hand.

51:02.560 --> 51:04.560
The smile this guy was giving us

51:04.560 --> 51:06.560
when he put his hand...

51:06.560 --> 51:08.560
Goddamn it.

51:08.560 --> 51:10.560
It's burning right in the air.

51:10.560 --> 51:12.560
Is there anybody else

51:12.560 --> 51:14.560
whose look we can see

51:14.560 --> 51:16.560
and make fun of?

51:16.560 --> 51:18.560
You must have a weird look.

51:18.560 --> 51:20.560
Why would hair grow

51:20.560 --> 51:22.560
faster than the hair on the rest of the body?

51:22.560 --> 51:24.560
Is there a breed where it's

51:24.560 --> 51:26.560
just like a bushy breed?

51:26.560 --> 51:28.560
Just like Chihuahua.

51:28.560 --> 51:30.560
You gotta maintain that shit

51:30.560 --> 51:32.560
before it gets out of hand.

51:32.560 --> 51:34.560
Going up here, we're really trainable.

51:34.560 --> 51:36.560
I'm Iranian, smart,

51:36.560 --> 51:38.560
but kind of standoffish.

51:38.560 --> 51:40.560
And like the Yorkshire Terrier,

51:40.560 --> 51:42.560
huge bush.

51:42.560 --> 51:44.560
There's just no going into it.

51:46.560 --> 51:48.560
Who here loves talking about dog bush?

51:50.560 --> 51:52.560
That's okay.

51:52.560 --> 51:54.560
Do we have another audience question?

51:56.560 --> 51:58.560
Dog down!

51:58.560 --> 52:00.560
Let's say it right there.

52:00.560 --> 52:02.560
Come on down.

52:02.560 --> 52:04.560
Everybody give him some applause.

52:04.560 --> 52:06.560
He hasn't done anything

52:06.560 --> 52:08.560
in this room.

52:08.560 --> 52:10.560
Dead air is like weird.

52:10.560 --> 52:12.560
What is your name sir?

52:12.560 --> 52:14.560
My name is Ryan.

52:14.560 --> 52:16.560
My younger brother

52:16.560 --> 52:18.560
is about to leave for college.

52:18.560 --> 52:20.560
I moved home since then.

52:20.560 --> 52:22.560
How do I deal with being

52:22.560 --> 52:24.560
basically the only child again

52:24.560 --> 52:26.560
for the first time since I was five?

52:26.560 --> 52:28.560
Is there a wall between your bedrooms?

52:28.560 --> 52:30.560
Take it out.

52:30.560 --> 52:32.560
Look who's here!

52:32.560 --> 52:34.560
King Ryan!

52:38.560 --> 52:40.560
Ryan's gonna do

52:40.560 --> 52:42.560
a little reworking

52:42.560 --> 52:44.560
on the house.

52:44.560 --> 52:46.560
He's gonna take that wall,

52:46.560 --> 52:48.560
clean the fuck out.

52:48.560 --> 52:50.560
Ryan, if I might suggest,

52:50.560 --> 52:52.560
you could also just totally regress

52:52.560 --> 52:54.560
and be like, I'm the only child now.

52:54.560 --> 52:56.560
Take care of baby Ryan.

52:56.560 --> 52:58.560
Oh, take care of me?

52:58.560 --> 53:00.560
I want ice cream.

53:00.560 --> 53:02.560
Ice cream, daddy ice cream.

53:02.560 --> 53:04.560
Buy me a dinosaur copy.

53:04.560 --> 53:06.560
Baby, I want all the toys

53:06.560 --> 53:08.560
on Toy Store.

53:08.560 --> 53:10.560
Baby, you gotta love me.

53:10.560 --> 53:12.560
Wait for the show dinosaur.

53:12.560 --> 53:14.560
Wait for the show dinosaur.

53:14.560 --> 53:16.560
Yeah, let's hear it for dinosaur.

53:16.560 --> 53:18.560
The show is on ABC Family.

53:18.560 --> 53:20.560
Should we talk about

53:20.560 --> 53:22.560
the plot of dinosaur?

53:22.560 --> 53:24.560
I mean, the bit where we talked

53:24.560 --> 53:26.560
about the plot of pay-for-wear

53:26.560 --> 53:28.560
was such a joint hit.

53:28.560 --> 53:30.560
Are you sad, Ryan?

53:30.560 --> 53:32.560
Just in general?

53:32.560 --> 53:34.560
I mean, what's your day-to-day

53:34.560 --> 53:36.560
happiness look like?

53:36.560 --> 53:38.560
I mean, that's your brother leaving.

53:38.560 --> 53:40.560
Does it make you sad?

53:40.560 --> 53:42.560
Yeah.

53:42.560 --> 53:44.560
I mean,

53:44.560 --> 53:46.560
what would you say

53:46.560 --> 53:48.560
your actual question was?

53:48.560 --> 53:50.560
Let's pretend that some people

53:50.560 --> 53:52.560
might not have been paying

53:52.560 --> 53:54.560
super close attention.

53:54.560 --> 53:56.560
Because they were thinking

53:56.560 --> 53:58.560
about a bit they were gonna do

53:58.560 --> 54:00.560
with you taking the wall down.

54:00.560 --> 54:02.560
And they didn't actually hear the question

54:02.560 --> 54:04.560
that you needed help with.

54:04.560 --> 54:06.560
This is kind of a thought experiment

54:06.560 --> 54:08.560
that we do so far on the show.

54:08.560 --> 54:10.560
So what would you say

54:10.560 --> 54:12.560
your actual question was?

54:12.560 --> 54:14.560
You know, what are some tips

54:14.560 --> 54:16.560
for being the only...

54:16.560 --> 54:18.560
The only child?

54:18.560 --> 54:20.560
Could you pretend like your brother had died

54:20.560 --> 54:22.560
and you guys didn't talk about

54:22.560 --> 54:24.560
the horrible accident?

54:24.560 --> 54:26.560
Oh, yeah.

54:26.560 --> 54:28.560
What was that sound?

54:28.560 --> 54:30.560
Travis hitting the nail on the head

54:30.560 --> 54:32.560
with a hammer.

54:32.560 --> 54:34.560
Pretend your brother died.

54:34.560 --> 54:36.560
He's dead now.

54:36.560 --> 54:38.560
Great comedy show, everybody.

54:38.560 --> 54:44.560
What are you doing?

54:44.560 --> 54:46.560
Ironically, the idea of my brother

54:46.560 --> 54:52.560
dying is bringing me some relief.

54:52.560 --> 54:54.560
Oh, yikes.

54:54.560 --> 54:56.560
Oh, man.

54:58.560 --> 55:00.560
But the other side of that is

55:00.560 --> 55:02.560
when you pretend like he died

55:02.560 --> 55:04.560
but then he comes home from college

55:04.560 --> 55:06.560
and isn't dying.

55:06.560 --> 55:12.560
It's basically a deposit you're making

55:12.560 --> 55:14.560
on a future miracle.

55:16.560 --> 55:18.560
Miracles are really just the reversal

55:18.560 --> 55:22.560
of lies you started believing.

55:22.560 --> 55:24.560
God, you are dropping some

55:24.560 --> 55:26.560
Mahatma shit over here.

55:26.560 --> 55:28.560
It's getting real in here.

55:28.560 --> 55:30.560
I think all of that helped.

55:30.560 --> 55:32.560
Yeah, you're welcome.

55:32.560 --> 55:34.560
I'm pretty confident

55:34.560 --> 55:36.560
you're gonna make it.

55:36.560 --> 55:38.560
Thank you, Ryan.

55:38.560 --> 55:40.560
We're done?

55:40.560 --> 55:42.560
Thank you so much, first off,

55:42.560 --> 55:44.560
to the People's Improved Theater

55:44.560 --> 55:46.560
for having us here.

55:46.560 --> 55:48.560
Holy shit, they've been incredible.

55:48.560 --> 55:50.560
We talked about this before

55:50.560 --> 55:52.560
and no fucking idea what we're doing

55:52.560 --> 55:54.560
in this department.

55:54.560 --> 55:56.560
They've done everything.

55:56.560 --> 55:58.560
Most of the people here

55:58.560 --> 56:00.560
were people that missed out on tickets

56:00.560 --> 56:02.560
to the second two shows.

56:02.560 --> 56:04.560
We're doing more?

56:04.560 --> 56:06.560
Yeah.

56:06.560 --> 56:08.560
It's gonna be really exhausting

56:08.560 --> 56:10.560
but we did it for you

56:10.560 --> 56:12.560
so I was thinking

56:12.560 --> 56:14.560
maybe a hand for us.

56:24.560 --> 56:26.560
Because you guys were standing outside

56:26.560 --> 56:28.560
like weirdos,

56:28.560 --> 56:30.560
you probably might have missed

56:30.560 --> 56:32.560
our new merch table.

56:32.560 --> 56:34.560
I bring this up not for us

56:34.560 --> 56:36.560
but for you.

56:36.560 --> 56:38.560
I don't want you...

56:38.560 --> 56:40.560
We don't know how to sell this online.

56:40.560 --> 56:42.560
We don't know how the internet works.

56:42.560 --> 56:44.560
I'll start with the coolest thing.

56:44.560 --> 56:46.560
It's so small,

56:46.560 --> 56:48.560
nobody can describe it.

56:48.560 --> 56:50.560
It's a sweet-ass patch

56:50.560 --> 56:52.560
to be a fraternal order of brothers

56:52.560 --> 56:54.560
with an awesome horse in front of the moon.

56:54.560 --> 56:56.560
We got button packs

56:56.560 --> 56:58.560
and these brand new beautiful tote bags.

56:58.560 --> 57:00.560
They pack your bags and move way tote bag.

57:00.560 --> 57:02.560
We've got some really cool

57:02.560 --> 57:04.560
bumper stickers and everything.

57:04.560 --> 57:06.560
More importantly, even if you don't grab anything

57:06.560 --> 57:08.560
on your way out, grab one of these postcards

57:08.560 --> 57:10.560
and if you use the coupon code...

57:10.560 --> 57:12.560
I won't say it out loud

57:12.560 --> 57:14.560
but use the coupon code.

57:14.560 --> 57:16.560
Does everyone see the coupon code?

57:16.560 --> 57:18.560
Grab the postcard on your way out

57:18.560 --> 57:20.560
and it'll give you a discount

57:20.560 --> 57:22.560
on your order online.

57:22.560 --> 57:24.560
Make sure you grab that

57:24.560 --> 57:26.560
and hang out in the bar,

57:26.560 --> 57:28.560
where I was here.

57:28.560 --> 57:30.560
We'll come out and say hi.

57:30.560 --> 57:32.560
For like 30 seconds and then we have to do another show.

57:32.560 --> 57:34.560
Yeah, whee!

57:34.560 --> 57:36.560
That's your fault, remember.

57:36.560 --> 57:38.560
I hate to interrupt you

57:38.560 --> 57:40.560
live, Justin, but you forgot

57:40.560 --> 57:42.560
to mention to thank Simple.

57:42.560 --> 57:44.560
It's me.
