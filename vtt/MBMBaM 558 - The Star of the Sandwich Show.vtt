00:00.000 --> 00:04.820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

00:05.760 --> 00:10.580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

00:11.480 --> 00:17.660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

Well, I don't think that's the moral of the little red hen Justin the little red hen who's too good

I always get that one confused. It is a grasshopper. Yeah, you know what I mean?

02:01.620 --> 02:06.860
That saves all the seeds. No, no, no the grasshopper. No, the grasshopper does a bad job

02:06.860 --> 02:13.500
Okay, who's the who's the kick-ass one? I think we can all agree on is that Griffin is the bad one?

02:13.500 --> 02:20.540

We're not leaving here until we feel the spirit move tonight

04:03.540 --> 04:07.580

04:07.980 --> 04:11.020
You're ready to pledge their lives to my brother my brother and me

04:11.020 --> 04:20.620
That's definitely not a weird vibe that people have accused us of leveraging for financial gain and we're gonna do show

04:20.620 --> 04:23.940
But the thing is this there's never been a better time

04:24.620 --> 04:27.980
To support the shows that you love and if you can do it, obviously

04:28.140 --> 04:30.540

I get it

04:31.300 --> 04:35.260
But if you can get five bucks a month at ten bucks a month you get all that

Join we need you. This is how we pay our bills and you heard about Griffin's son. He's got gas has the worst

04:47.700 --> 04:54.260
Gas this child breathes and when we breathe air goes time to go to lungs so we can oxygenate the blood and keep the body

04:54.260 --> 04:57.840
Pumping and when this little guy breathes, it's like to tummy town

04:57.840 --> 05:02.700
We go to make more farts and burps to hurt the Sun to hurt the baby and keep him from the sleep

05:02.760 --> 05:07.460
But I'm not talking about that today today. I'm talking about max fun driving what your support means to me

05:07.460 --> 05:11.380
It's a man. If you donate five hundred dollars a month, you can name Griffin son. That's true

05:11.420 --> 05:15.500
You do get the naming rights to that. I'm huge and you know, you know what I'm talking about right now

05:15.860 --> 05:22.900
Read on me piss boys. Oh, man. We were just starting to get into a good mood. Come on

05:24.620 --> 05:27.100
Okay, now here's what I like about though

05:27.100 --> 05:30.940
There's many things that I like about this riddle can't talk about riddle.com for a second

05:30.940 --> 05:35.100

That's what you're all Bix factory mix up. It's fun and I did riddles calm

05:44.060 --> 05:49.700
Here's a P and a lot of people been like riddles calm is so dope. Here's what you don't know about riddles calm

05:49.900 --> 05:55.040
There is not a button on there. That's like sort by bad. Yeah, right. There's not a button on there

05:55.040 --> 06:01.980
It's like trash rules only. Thank you. I have a comedy podcast. You have to read through a lot of fucking brain teasers

06:01.980 --> 06:08.660
Yeah, get to the actual whatever the to get to the chaff to get the wheat out of there and find the chaff

06:08.660 --> 06:10.820
You really have to go digging so I have

06:11.700 --> 06:15.140
This was not user submitted. This was me. I did this

06:15.140 --> 06:21.860
I put the work in so that I could do the deliverables for my brothers and it begins. That's me

06:22.620 --> 06:26.820
Once upon a time as all good riddles begin once upon a time

06:26.820 --> 06:32.060
John was walking in the woods to go fishing for some food but got lost but he got across an

06:32.300 --> 06:37.140
Old house and asked the owner the owner invited John and they began to tell a story

06:37.140 --> 06:39.140
The old man said once upon a time

06:39.340 --> 06:42.700
Two best friends now you might be wondering at this point the riddle

06:42.700 --> 06:45.700
No, those two once upon a times are completely unrelated

06:46.180 --> 06:52.580
Once upon a time two best friends were on a deserted island. There was no food. So they began to die of hunger

06:52.580 --> 06:58.900
They agreed to fight until one of them died. The winner would eat the loser and thus be saved besides

06:59.180 --> 07:04.100
No one would ever know about that. They began to fight and finally one of the best friends won

07:05.260 --> 07:11.540
Meaning that the other one was eaten and betrayed then John pulled out a gun and killed the old man at once

07:11.820 --> 07:13.540
Why would he do it?

07:13.540 --> 07:15.380
to eat him

07:15.380 --> 07:17.180
for power

07:17.180 --> 07:21.380
To eat him for power. If it's any other answer, then I feel like my time's been wasted

07:21.380 --> 07:23.380
Justin

07:24.540 --> 07:30.780
I said you get a magnet at ten dollars a month and it's it's not that it's an enamel pin and I'm really sorry about

07:30.780 --> 07:37.540
That that's my riddle and I just solved it. Okay. Oh pretty good start for our literal first pledge break. I

07:38.140 --> 07:41.040
Just want to mention that I but he boned it pretty bad

07:42.060 --> 07:44.460
Like an immediate mess up now

07:44.460 --> 07:50.860
Here's what I want to talk about in this riddle because the answer is the old man was the cannibal and I feel like in this

07:50.860 --> 07:59.340
riddle John our hero makes a big old leap because the old man began by saying once upon a time and

07:59.940 --> 08:05.020
Told what seems to be a made-up story about two friends on an island

08:05.020 --> 08:09.540
Why is the other and then John leaves to the conclusion that even though the story began?

08:10.380 --> 08:15.540
Once upon a time clearly this old man was talking about himself and needed to be shot

08:15.540 --> 08:21.700
Yeah, wait. Yeah, that's a good point trap. Yeah, I think you really undermined this

08:21.700 --> 08:26.100
Well, I'm starting to think these riddles aren't very good. That's my worry

08:26.340 --> 08:32.940
I'm worried about it because it's like I'm it's hard not to look at all the other bits now that yahoo answers is

08:35.020 --> 08:39.380
Falling into the grave right now. Yes. I travel be honest with you

08:39.380 --> 08:42.620
Sometimes I worry that the riddles on riddles calm aren't great

08:42.620 --> 08:49.020
Well, I hate to disagree with you Griffin because there is a voting mechanic on riddles.com. Oh, okay, and this one has

08:49.900 --> 08:51.900
45 thumbs up and

08:52.580 --> 08:58.300
47 thumbs down. So it seems almost pretty evenly split. It's pretty it's almost nothing

08:58.300 --> 09:04.180
It's almost a nothing riddle. Well, there are folks you can't decide like, ooh, is this John?

09:04.900 --> 09:11.340
Shooting an old man for telling a story pretty good pretty good riddle nice stumped me

09:11.340 --> 09:13.340
Hey Margaret, you gotta hear this one

09:13.340 --> 09:20.420
I didn't see it coming and then I guess I suppose in this story John eats him. Yeah. Yeah

09:23.300 --> 09:24.820
Good times

09:24.820 --> 09:31.380
Let's test. Let's answer your question. I feel like it's been so this first question from Tim here. Yes, it is Justin

09:32.180 --> 09:34.980
What a treat for me. Oh boy. Howdy

09:35.740 --> 09:37.500
Tim here

09:37.500 --> 09:42.020
Probably the best local newsman. Oh, yeah, if I if I had to say mm-hmm

09:42.420 --> 09:50.300
The broadcast Dave lavender takes tops like local newsman period right like Tim here if you're going broadcast Tim ears, man

09:50.300 --> 09:54.300
I'm here. You know what? I one thing I'll say about Tim here places. He's Tim here

09:54.300 --> 09:58.460
I read interview with him where they asked him what his greatest fear was

09:58.460 --> 10:01.260
I don't know I've talked about this before but it's worth revisiting

10:01.260 --> 10:08.700
I asked what his greatest fear was and you know, he said what nothing. Yeah, no fear Tim here

10:08.700 --> 10:10.700
Let's see what's on his agenda today

10:10.980 --> 10:15.900
Checking with no fear Tim here who loves hot sauce another thing about Tim. He's not afraid of the heat

10:16.260 --> 10:19.040
Not afraid of the heat not not afraid of anything

10:20.300 --> 10:25.660
Whenever I walk outside on a windy day, and you know, he's always out there walking that beat looking for scoops

10:25.660 --> 10:31.380
The narrow casting happening right now is is it's basically just Tim here

10:31.380 --> 10:38.220
I don't think the version of Tim here that I'm describing would even be recognizable to to some of his other WSA Z colleagues

10:38.880 --> 10:40.880
so have I

10:41.300 --> 10:48.920
Cuz I reference Bill Murray and that fool left in 2013 to go to Kentucky where all of our most hallowed news people go

10:48.920 --> 10:55.240
To die. It's the elephant graveyard of Huntington News people

10:56.160 --> 10:59.640
Man, I'm just realizing that Rob Johnson's gonna listen to this and get all pissed off

10:59.640 --> 11:04.800
Yeah, okay. Well, you need to send in a question Rob. Step it the fuck up Rob. Come on Rob

11:05.200 --> 11:09.760
Let's get it going Tim here is on the show now. Yeah now that Yahoo Answers is dead

11:10.120 --> 11:16.240
We're gonna start a segment on my brother my brother me where we just talk about Huntington News anchors for an hour

11:16.240 --> 11:20.200
It'd be fun. There's another fact about Tim here. He looks just like Woody from Toy Story

11:20.920 --> 11:26.040
So much so that he used to wear a woody costume. I don't remember if it was on the air or fun

11:27.360 --> 11:29.360
Justin had

11:32.080 --> 11:34.080
All right here doesn't tweet a lot

11:35.600 --> 11:39.880
These are just some Tim facts some Tim some Tim bits

11:39.880 --> 11:45.720
Um just but you know get in man, actually, you know what now I'm looking through his history

11:46.520 --> 11:48.520
It's more than I thought

11:48.520 --> 11:52.380
His most recent tweet is r.i.p. Greg Jacobs aka Humpty Hump

11:53.000 --> 11:58.840
So these he's he's a guy's thumb on the pulse. He does he's Tim here. I would love so here's a tip

11:58.840 --> 12:01.480
What you're wondering the question? Yeah, I can tell already

12:02.200 --> 12:05.240
But I clicked away from the page to look for more Tim your nugs

12:05.240 --> 12:08.400
I know I gotta go all the way back to the question Tim bits fuck

12:08.400 --> 12:09.640
obviously

12:09.640 --> 12:11.640
Tim bits

12:13.440 --> 12:16.040
Whenever I walk outside on a windy day I Tim here

12:16.600 --> 12:21.280
Walk outside on a windy day particularly in the pollen filled days of spring and summer my eyes water

12:21.640 --> 12:24.440
Other people walk by obviously think I'm crying

12:24.720 --> 12:29.300
One older woman who was clearly moved by what she perceived as an emotionally distraught passerby

12:29.700 --> 12:33.200
Actually went so far as to produce a handkerchief from her purse and wipe my tears

12:33.200 --> 12:39.920
I'm given I've given serious consideration wearing a sign around my neck or perhaps a t-shirt with the emblazoned message

12:39.920 --> 12:43.760
I'm not crying and that's from Tim. I'm not crying ear

12:44.680 --> 12:48.440
It's at Tim. I know he's not afraid of emotion. Yeah

12:49.920 --> 12:51.920
He's Tim

12:52.000 --> 12:56.800
The only thing Tim is afraid of is lying to the people. Yeah, I've seen him

12:56.800 --> 13:03.240
I've seen him talk about stuff on the news and he'll be like and the Highton Highlanders came back to win it

13:16.880 --> 13:20.560
Nailed it though. We got a the Marshall thundering herd made quite

13:20.560 --> 13:22.560
I

13:25.480 --> 13:27.480
It's a lot about football

13:31.040 --> 13:33.320
But they let him you know a lot of you don't know this

13:33.320 --> 13:35.720
But if you're the anchor do you really care about one a lot?

13:35.720 --> 13:41.160
They'll let you do it instead this nice because they don't make him do any of the sad sports stuff, right?

13:41.760 --> 13:47.160
Or even the happy ones just the emotionally moving ones. Yeah, but he can be like, yes

13:47.160 --> 13:52.360
There is a big ritual cult murder that happened in the park. Whatever whatever, but did you hear about these?

13:55.800 --> 13:58.800
Um, I wonder if Tim realizes that um

14:00.200 --> 14:07.440
Old women giving you handkerchiefs because you appear to be crying is not something that happens to us that are not TV news anchors

14:07.440 --> 14:11.760
Yeah, that are not specifically Huntington's own Tim. Yeah. Oh, yeah, that's a

14:11.760 --> 14:17.860
Fair point Tim is like whenever I walk down the street eight people hand me bagels and wish me a happy day

14:18.120 --> 14:24.800
Pretty sure I could be walking down the street openly saloping not just like and I think older women would think oh

14:24.800 --> 14:31.000
He's probably on bath salts or something along those lines. That would probably be the vibe. I specifically will say this though

14:31.000 --> 14:36.720
I will say this to Lynn credence to Tim's issue if I see Tim here

14:37.360 --> 14:39.360
local news anchor Tim here

14:39.360 --> 14:43.840
Wandering the streets sobbing to himself in my head. I'm like, what the fuck?

14:43.840 --> 14:49.800
Oh, no on in Huntington some something really does he know that is there an asteroid headed right?

14:51.040 --> 14:59.000
Yeah, man with no fear is crying. We're all doomed. Yeah, it would be terrifying lantern is crying. What's happening? I

15:01.080 --> 15:02.800
Used to have this concern

15:02.800 --> 15:09.200
when we used to go to church as kids and I would yawn so hard that my eyes would water and I wasn't worried about

15:09.200 --> 15:14.760
People seeing me yawning. I was worried that they might think I was so moved by the sermon that I was crying and they would

15:14.760 --> 15:20.520
Think did Travis do some bad shit. Did Travis about to recommit his life to the Lord for a third time. I

15:21.400 --> 15:27.240
Did do it a second time because I liked the attention right? Well in the first one you were clearly faking it

15:27.240 --> 15:29.940
Yeah, the first one didn't take off right? Yeah

15:30.500 --> 15:35.400
You know what Tim? Here's what I would suggest. Just let this if this happens to you again

15:35.400 --> 15:40.000
Just let people feel like they did you a solid. Yeah, you've done so much on you

15:40.000 --> 15:41.880
Let them feel like oh, that was a nice thing

15:41.880 --> 15:45.360
I did I did a good turn for Timmy or I hope you appreciated it

15:45.360 --> 15:50.000
And then when you do the newscast later that day have their handkerchief hanging out of your sleeve

15:50.880 --> 15:57.960
To show that you enjoy their favor that you are now doing the news for them that night, right? Like a jouster

15:57.960 --> 16:05.840
Mm-hmm. Who has handkerchiefs old ladies? Yeah, and now Tamir. Yep. And now Tamir has her handkerchiefs

16:05.840 --> 16:06.920
I heard that in his office

16:06.920 --> 16:14.920
He nails up the handkerchiefs one by one as they're given to him much much like Willie Mays Hayes does in the the hit baseball

16:14.920 --> 16:19.160
Movies major league. Yeah, I hear he makes a necklace out of really

16:19.320 --> 16:23.760
Yeah, I heard he pulls them out of his sleeve one by one like a clown. They're all tied together

16:23.760 --> 16:29.040
Yeah, and in the end his underpants. That's funny and sexy. It's funny and sexy

16:29.840 --> 16:36.900
Rob Johnson the the floor is yours the this I I can continue to read Yahoo

16:37.600 --> 16:44.000
For another like six days. I mean, I guess I guess there's no reason to not right

16:44.000 --> 16:48.520
Let me say this Graham Roebuck sending a lot of goodens and a very sweet message

16:48.520 --> 16:56.160
Well, thank you. Thank you Graham Roebuck for your for your service. This one's asked by Yahoo answers user William who asks

16:56.600 --> 16:58.600
Why is there no big fruit?

16:59.200 --> 17:02.200
Why is all why is all fruit small enough to hold with your hand?

17:02.200 --> 17:03.560
I know we have berries and apples

17:03.560 --> 17:09.400
But I think watermelons are the biggest fruit I know of and you can just hold it with two hands or one if you're strong

17:09.400 --> 17:16.200
Why is there no big fruit now? Listen, there's gonna be some science folk out there like your Hank greens your Hanks green

17:16.200 --> 17:22.840
Oh, we're in a tick tock is right now aren't we you search biggest fruit? I shit you not I

17:23.320 --> 17:30.960
Shit you not searched biggest fruit first image Hank green superimposed in front of a picture of a water

17:32.480 --> 17:37.920
Yesterday BB asked me how's lightning work and I pulled up a video and I was like, okay

17:37.920 --> 17:41.720
I don't see any of Hank green stank on this any of stank green on this and

17:41.720 --> 17:46.560
Then fucking right there at the end of the video executive producer Hank green. Oh

17:47.800 --> 17:50.960
Like we're in a tick tock of his right now and he's just like

17:51.720 --> 17:53.720
He's probably using this audio and being like

18:00.600 --> 18:05.760
So Hank green is gonna tell you that the problem is is that the fruit gets too big it falls off trees

18:05.760 --> 18:10.760
Well Hank green counterpoint. Why don't we have bigger trees then? Yeah. Yeah Hank

18:10.760 --> 18:17.000
Stronger trees. Give me some virile trees trees where the branches bend down all the way down to the ground

18:17.000 --> 18:21.680
So the fruit can just sit on the ground and hang out and then when the fruit falls up the branches whip way up high

18:21.680 --> 18:25.280
In the air and gives a bird a scare. Yeah. Hey crank green. That's good

18:25.960 --> 18:31.480
What about pumpkins? Yep. Hey, hey Hank. Did you forget about?

18:33.280 --> 18:38.760
When you gave us this answer that we imagined a few seconds ago remember when you Hank green said that

18:38.760 --> 18:42.840
Yeah, or Travis attributed that to you and what about the fucking ground Hank?

18:42.840 --> 18:47.280
So I guess it's not on the ground Hank. It's not about trees. Is it Hank?

18:47.840 --> 18:54.560
Hey teens following this guy. This is this is I've revealed the curtain and you could see the wizard behind it

18:54.560 --> 18:59.340
It's just a it's just Hank green lying to you about fruit. He's guessing about fruit

18:59.600 --> 19:01.600
He's guessing about food. He forgot about

19:02.000 --> 19:06.340
He forgot about fucking pumpkins so embarrassed for him in that imaginary

19:06.340 --> 19:11.460
response Travis attributed to him and so that I mean that's the thing is like there are some fruit this big like

19:11.860 --> 19:17.460
Pumpkin pumpkins is big huge. You kidding me. What about durians? I've never seen one in real

19:18.060 --> 19:20.060
Jack fruits a big boy Jack

19:21.580 --> 19:26.740
But durian stinky not big. Thank you for it. There's but there's a cap on it, huh?

19:26.740 --> 19:30.940
And the cap is pumpkin that we wear but here's the thing

19:30.940 --> 19:34.820
I've seen some fucking big pumpkins not in person mind you but in pictures

19:34.820 --> 19:36.780
No, I know maybe they're photoshopped

19:36.780 --> 19:42.340
I don't know but like there's a variability in the size of pumpkin you never been at travel you seriously never been to the

19:43.340 --> 19:48.420
You never been to the pumpkin festival? No, I went but I specifically didn't look at the big pumpkin because I was afraid

19:48.420 --> 19:52.660
I was afraid yeah, he'd get trapped inside of it. It's a completely legitimate fear

19:52.660 --> 19:57.980
But I think it could spontaneously like roll on to me, you know, right and he would yeah you die

19:57.980 --> 20:05.500
I think that the question we're really asking here is why is most fruits so small? Yeah

20:06.420 --> 20:08.300
Cuz bird is small

20:08.300 --> 20:11.180
Birds so wait what cuz birds is small

20:11.180 --> 20:14.820
The birds gotta eat the fruit and then poop out some fruit birds don't eat fruit

20:14.820 --> 20:20.580
Birds eat worms some birds do fruit birds eat worms and birds eat crackers. That's true. Fuck. That's a good point

20:20.860 --> 20:26.900
What about lemurs Griffin? Yeah lemurs do love it. I lemurs are like the birds of monkeys if you think about it

20:26.900 --> 20:33.820
How do bananas know how big to be? I guess as they look at the other bananas around. Yeah, it's all comparing

20:33.820 --> 20:37.220
And that's what's so harmful as they see a lot of pictures and magazines of

20:37.860 --> 20:40.980
Bananas that look a certain way. Yeah, and they think that that's gonna be see now

20:40.980 --> 20:45.180
I wish my last name was green because sometimes I ask questions like that and I want sort of an erudite

20:45.980 --> 20:50.380
discussion about it and but you wish we hadn't gone so hard on but then Travis says stuff like

20:50.380 --> 20:57.340
The banana looks with its banana eyes at the other bananas and feels banana peer pressure to look like the other bananas

20:57.340 --> 21:02.020
Well, no, I hold on. I didn't say the banana peer pressure thing. That was Justin

21:02.020 --> 21:06.700
I said they look around and that lets them know how big regardless like neither of you came at me with that

21:06.700 --> 21:12.900
Er that good heat that like I know I just happen to know. Oh, that's funny. You asked that I happen

21:12.900 --> 21:17.380
No, you guys have never ever once said to me. Oh, it's funny. You asked that Griffin. I know exactly

21:17.380 --> 21:21.020
I don't think about something. I know great. You always ask shit. I don't know

21:22.580 --> 21:25.860
Ask me something I know right now right now ask me something, you know

21:25.860 --> 21:29.180
I know is it bad that I can't think of anything Wow

21:29.740 --> 21:32.100
Wow, pretty bad. There's things

21:32.540 --> 21:37.460
Wait, hold on Griffin. You know me right? Yeah, but like I don't know what you know

21:38.580 --> 21:41.660
Huh? I cuz I feel like you sort of float through

21:41.660 --> 21:48.140
Through life. Yeah on a little cloud. Yeah, and it's like the thing in Mario Brothers

21:48.620 --> 21:51.100
Trav, what's the big what when you start?

21:52.460 --> 21:57.540
Blacksmithing what's some of the early stuff that you'll learn? What are some of the first skills? Oh, thank you so much Justin

21:57.580 --> 21:59.580
You will learn you should say

22:00.260 --> 22:06.060
No, I just Travis just to take again. It's a it's funny. It's funny. You asked that it's funny

22:06.060 --> 22:11.140
You asked that hey teens. It's me Travis McRoy your favorite brother

22:11.140 --> 22:13.620
It wasn't blacksmithing, huh? Well, I

22:14.740 --> 22:20.660
Realize me. I got a taper. I mean you don't it's the energy is so off

22:20.660 --> 22:23.940
I'm trying to match Hank Green's energy. He doesn't go

22:24.940 --> 22:26.940
It's oh you want to know about the biggest fruit

22:28.620 --> 22:33.980
Okay, to be fair in that specific video John Green is choking him out that does happen a lot

22:33.980 --> 22:38.300
I will say this about those two. I wish they didn't fight as much like physically fight

22:38.300 --> 22:42.900
Yeah, it's very upsetting like her green will be doing a video about like, you know

22:42.900 --> 22:47.140
I don't know like why tornadoes happen and suddenly John Green will just karate

22:48.780 --> 22:55.540
Like fucking spear him into his computer and break it. I saw John Green speed bag Hank Green's butt once

22:57.740 --> 22:59.740
Yeah, but like you know what

23:00.100 --> 23:01.820
fucking glass houses

23:01.820 --> 23:06.820
Yeah, we should be back. We speed bag each other's butts on camera before. Oh, yeah all this time cuz we're

23:06.820 --> 23:12.780
We're brother. We're Brascal boys. Yeah, and boys punch butts boys Brascal boys punch each other butts

23:12.860 --> 23:15.520
Yeah, those little rascals love punching butts

23:16.620 --> 23:22.180

Speaking of max fun drive, perhaps we should reach for the star Wow

26:14.180 --> 26:17.540
So you're doing a lot of hits well, I just wanted to make it feel special

26:17.540 --> 26:23.820
It's our first max fun drive episode and I went to bring the I wanted to bring the two of my bits that people seem to like

26:25.780 --> 26:31.980
Please okay. What's that? Travis? No, I didn't I wasn't going to editorialize in any way

26:31.980 --> 26:36.740
I just want to hear the this segment. Okay, so I will read

26:37.260 --> 26:39.220
some reviews left

26:39.220 --> 26:46.100
With with a certain amount of stars. These are all four and five star comments. Oh on on a product on

26:47.100 --> 26:54.340
Amazon I will read you those comments and you guys are going to try to guess what that product is first comment Wow

26:54.340 --> 26:58.520
It works did a good job cleaning out the gunk and earwax

26:58.520 --> 27:01.720
Is it one of those earwax cleaners outers?

27:03.080 --> 27:05.440
Like one of the things it's got a little camera on it

27:05.440 --> 27:08.480
I see him I get Facebook ads all the time where it's like hey you dirty fuck

27:08.720 --> 27:14.760
Get check out this big nasty glob. You can pull out of your human head man. Facebook has you pegged, huh?

27:14.820 --> 27:19.200
Yeah, it does. It knows that I remember. Yeah, you coming a mile away. All right, Justin guess

27:19.780 --> 27:21.340
No, okay

27:21.340 --> 27:25.540
Second comment boy was that not the answer? No, that was not the answer Griffin

27:25.540 --> 27:28.920
No, that was it. Do you think that I would be like guess the product?

27:29.000 --> 27:32.040
Anyways, it's the thing that cleans out you know, come on

27:32.040 --> 27:37.040
The best thing to clean up ears is caps of BIC pins, but I'm assuming it's not BIC pins

27:37.040 --> 27:39.400
That is visceral what you just said

27:41.000 --> 27:42.800
My wife's a doctor I can't be wrong

27:42.800 --> 27:47.920
Okay used today on a two-mile swim works great and forms to my ears

27:48.040 --> 27:52.880
Keeps water out and dries to use multiple times kids. Don't try this at home

27:52.880 --> 27:59.880
Only adults can stick things in their ears. Is it a wax product? Is it wax some sort of ear?

28:00.640 --> 28:06.900
Wax that you use to protect from swimmers ear incorrect. I'm starting to think that people are not using this

28:08.000 --> 28:12.820
Object. This is like an off-label usage. Yeah, it's like floam or some shit

28:13.600 --> 28:16.440
Okay, or you know how you can smoke flow. Yeah

28:17.400 --> 28:20.000
incredibly high and then you run down the street saw

28:20.000 --> 28:28.180
Okay, I burst my eardrum back in March and my ENT recommended this of all things to use as an earplug

28:28.560 --> 28:34.220
Because it usually stickiness to stay in as opposed to having to be shoved down to the ear canal

28:34.440 --> 28:41.000
This was a great bang for my buck. Oh my god. Is it like silly buddy is silly buddy Justin

28:42.160 --> 28:44.240
So flow wasn't even that far

28:44.240 --> 28:51.100
I've holy shit really was silly putty pack of six Justin

28:51.440 --> 28:57.920
This is a weird reach for the stars were actually come out a little smarter. Yeah, then I went in because this is a whole

28:59.040 --> 29:05.340
World that I did not understand. I don't know about I mean, I guess it makes sense right silly putty wasn't it invented?

29:06.360 --> 29:09.720
To be silly putty, you know what I mean? So why wouldn't it be?

29:09.720 --> 29:14.720
Uh, why wouldn't it be an ear an earplug thing now?

29:14.720 --> 29:18.360
And so just just a guy trying to make fake rubber made silly buddy

29:18.360 --> 29:20.240
He also made great earplug thing here

29:20.240 --> 29:25.020
There are four more quick comments here that I I just I had one first one

29:25.320 --> 29:28.760
received on time and they are a crowd pleaser and

29:29.520 --> 29:32.280
That makes me think that perhaps for a feature live shows

29:32.280 --> 29:39.040
I see on jokes fucking hand out some silly putty. It makes me think that the crowd you hang out with sucks

29:41.320 --> 29:48.280
These three comments these were reviews left by three different people and I at three different times I cannot stress this enough

29:48.280 --> 29:51.560
I'm going to read all three of them. It really is silly putty

29:52.480 --> 29:57.560
It's putty. It's silly. Yeah, silly putty. It is right there

29:57.560 --> 30:03.640
That last one's silly putty. It is tribe. You should have read us one of those ones because it'd be easier to

30:03.960 --> 30:10.840
Yeah, but I thought that might give it away. Yeah, was that the only one? Yep. Oh, wow. Okay. I like that Travis

30:10.840 --> 30:12.920
That was your best reach for the stars yet. I would say yeah

30:14.440 --> 30:16.440
Well, you don't have to sound

30:21.600 --> 30:26.960
Hey everybody we don't I wouldn't normally highlight this but halfway through the episode

30:26.960 --> 30:28.960
We had to take a break and then pick it back up

30:29.000 --> 30:34.560
The next day and now I'm having my coffee and the sun is shining and I'm wondering and I I want us to really think

30:34.560 --> 30:37.180
About it. Did we go too hard on Hank Green? I

30:37.880 --> 30:42.320
Yeah, yeah in the light of day. I feel like I think I called him. I

30:42.880 --> 30:47.200
Think I called him spank green. There was definitely crank green was in there stank

30:47.200 --> 30:52.720
Green green is libelous and I feel to fucking like he's he's been nothing but very kind to us

30:52.720 --> 30:57.000
Just like he's always been so nice to us and like we've worked with him on stuff a lot. Yeah

30:57.840 --> 31:00.960
And like I've texted him as a human. Oh, yeah, he's a power a lot

31:02.520 --> 31:07.000
Good is a good person and I don't know why I call him crank

31:07.360 --> 31:09.720
Yeah, we were really hard spank green

31:11.880 --> 31:14.240
Should we say up to me? I think you know what?

31:14.240 --> 31:17.680
I think part of it is is cuz he had YouTube and he took tick-tock. Yeah

31:17.680 --> 31:22.840
I think that if I'm being honest about it now in the harsh light of day, he did have YouTube already

31:22.960 --> 31:25.840
Then he took tick-tock and he doesn't seem right

31:25.840 --> 31:32.800
He did try to come he and John tried to come for brother podcasts, which yeah did feel a little you know

31:32.800 --> 31:35.280
What now I'm actually coming back around the other side. Yeah

31:36.280 --> 31:42.600
Yeah, he and his wife then also tried to do like married couple like podcast also kind of our thing

31:42.600 --> 31:47.600
Just like crank. That is a real crank move. It's a real crank move

31:47.640 --> 31:51.140
Yeah, real crank move crank. Okay

31:51.840 --> 31:57.500
I'm back around. I'm back around. All right, good. Well, I'm glad we put left him right in this place

31:58.880 --> 32:02.480
What do you want another question? Yeah. Yeah, my morning brain is ready for a question

32:02.920 --> 32:04.520
Yeah, this is a new day

32:04.520 --> 32:11.680
Like we're now imbued with the knowledge of what happened yesterday and spoiler alert is pretty similar to the 300 plus days before

32:11.680 --> 32:16.280
But all becomes a blur did have some new releases of the circle

32:18.000 --> 32:23.720
Hey, can we take another break and come back then in like an hour so I guess go to question three J man

32:25.320 --> 32:27.920
Computer computer execute question three

32:27.920 --> 32:33.560
I don't normally work that way where it's sort of like you call the shots and I I know but it's a new day

32:34.080 --> 32:41.040
It's a new day. Okay, my roommate works at Harris Teeter. Oh, man. I love a Harris team. Oh, yeah

32:41.040 --> 32:46.920
I do not know what this fucking name if you got to get down to the beach with this man Harris Teeter down there

32:46.920 --> 32:48.760
Oh, they got everything. Oh

32:48.760 --> 32:54.020
Boy, I love a Harris Teeter. Okay, my roommate works at Harris Teeter and about a month at man

32:54.020 --> 32:57.200
I hope there's tea every time I express affection for something

32:57.200 --> 33:03.620
I'm so ready for somebody be like actually they put pigeons in the furnace every morning to start the electric

33:03.620 --> 33:08.380
That's like something it's just something about a month ago

33:08.380 --> 33:14.660
Okay, so my roommate works at Harris Teeter about a month ago who shows up at her 8 a.m. Shift, but Bill Murray himself

33:14.660 --> 33:19.520
I'm guessing they mean of stage and screen and not Huntington's own Bill Murray

33:20.860 --> 33:25.420
We did talk about other Bill Murray now Kentucky's right

33:26.780 --> 33:29.380
Kentucky at this is Hollywood's

33:29.380 --> 33:34.900
Bill yeah, as he's known the other Bill Murray the Garfield

33:35.740 --> 33:39.660
Struck up a casual conversation with her and asked if she went to a school nearby

33:40.220 --> 33:46.740
After confirming that yes, she does and she lives on campus. He asked if she had a car to drive to work

33:47.460 --> 33:51.720
Unfortunately, we're college students who spend the majority of our income on to Tina's Pizza Rolls TM

33:51.720 --> 33:54.860
And so she always walks as he finishes ring amber groceries

33:54.860 --> 33:57.400
He pulls out his wallet and hands our roommate a $50 bill

33:57.400 --> 34:00.720
He tells her to put it towards a bike fun. She did not buy a bike

34:01.400 --> 34:06.280
Instead a week later. We used Bill Murray's hard-earned money to buy a kitten. He was on sale in her defense

34:06.400 --> 34:08.400
He does not have a tail

34:12.280 --> 34:14.280
The prosecution rests

34:14.680 --> 34:18.760
What should my roommate do if Bill Murray comes back and ask about the bike?

34:19.320 --> 34:23.560
So sorry if you hear this bill now, this is interesting, isn't it?

34:23.560 --> 34:28.640
Mm-hmm, because here's the sequence Bill Murray said hello. Do you have a car and

34:29.120 --> 34:31.160
And I'm not that directly

34:31.880 --> 34:36.700
Because that does feel like a setup for something. Hello. Do you have a car and the person said no

34:36.700 --> 34:43.040
I take a bike and decide the person said no I walk and Bill Murray said here's $50 buy a bike

34:43.200 --> 34:47.020
It's like well, why don't I is I'm sort of fun anyway

34:47.020 --> 34:53.420
Yeah aspirational why I go and put this towards, you know a car fun or maybe perhaps even a Vespa fun

34:53.420 --> 34:59.060
Well, I think Bill wants to feel like he's made a significant contribution to your transit fun

34:59.060 --> 35:04.620
That's right and $50 towards car is not as impressive as $50 towards bike. Yeah to scale that back

35:04.620 --> 35:08.980
Let's see. How much is the car? He's gonna get a used car for like $5,000, right? So 50

35:10.820 --> 35:14.380
Used car for $5,000. Well, that's what I mean. I'll rely Craigslist

35:14.380 --> 35:19.380
You pride to find one for free if you're willing to get in the carburetor a little bit get elbow deep

35:19.820 --> 35:25.500
Hey, let's hey what Bill Murray should have said was here's $50 buy yourself a really nice bottle of wine

35:25.500 --> 35:29.100
Oh, doesn't that seem more charitable that doesn't that seem nicer? Yeah

35:29.100 --> 35:36.020
But that's the way both the way you said it and buying someone is a lid a little creepy a bike

35:36.020 --> 35:38.100
Oh, yeah, but he's Bill Murray

35:38.100 --> 35:44.860
He defied he defies that like and and defines that and defines that it's enough of a cultural legacy

35:44.940 --> 35:50.660
Hey kid, buy yourself a bike though feels like a cool move. Hey fucking cool. Hey, man

35:51.140 --> 35:56.780
Get yourself like but actually I guess what he was doing was hey, here's like 10% of a bike. I

35:57.580 --> 35:59.100
love

35:59.100 --> 36:00.700
$50 I

36:00.700 --> 36:01.940
love

36:01.940 --> 36:06.540
$50 $50 who's on that way highlighted before that? That's that's that's a good

36:06.540 --> 36:11.620
You belay video. That's awesome. Well, it's I mean it's up to 70 now in this fucking generation

36:13.900 --> 36:15.900
Cash bandicoot. Yeah

36:17.420 --> 36:21.020
Rats you motherfucker got like ratchet and crank

36:22.420 --> 36:24.100
Green

36:24.100 --> 36:26.220
anyway

36:26.220 --> 36:28.260
$50 I love it. I love it. I love it

36:28.260 --> 36:35.580
But if Bill Murray gave you $50 isn't there a part of you that's like I don't want to I want to frame

36:35.580 --> 36:41.540
This frame. This is my Bill Murray $50. Well, that's the thing right is a part of a bike

36:41.620 --> 36:48.820
That's fine, but Bill Murray paid for this cat. That's way better a good and I hate also

36:49.540 --> 36:51.500
Excuse me question asker

36:51.500 --> 36:56.900
How in the fuck are you gonna tell us you got a cat and not tell us what the name of it is?

36:56.900 --> 37:03.300
Yeah, because if it doesn't relate to Bill Murray in some way they'll hurry Bill Perry Bill Perry Bill Perry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry

37:03.300 --> 37:08.740
Sorry, sorry, Bill Perry. Can I just actually did you have a little lag Justin because I did say at first I

37:09.620 --> 37:10.900
Literally, I'm sitting here

37:10.900 --> 37:14.200
I do not know which one of you said at first because of internet latency

37:14.200 --> 37:17.940
But I also want to say that there's probably a whole Garfield vector that

37:18.380 --> 37:23.980
Just completely did not want to explore and this is also one of those moments where I feel like I just want to rattle off

37:23.980 --> 37:29.020
Anyone I could think of so nobody tweets later like I can't believe you guys didn't say like Bill Perry Bill

37:29.020 --> 37:34.580
Hurry, I mean no worries like so it's predetermined. Yeah, it's that good

37:34.580 --> 37:39.860
You know, it's a dope name for this cat that Bill Murray paid for is you call him Lorenzo musics Garfield

37:45.020 --> 37:48.660
Lorenzo music is one of the great names. Yeah, powerful

37:50.180 --> 37:54.380
Wait, hold on wait, I had a follow-up. Why do cats go on when do cats go on sale?

37:54.380 --> 38:00.060
I guess if it is when they lose their tail in their 10% off. I guess so. Is that what happened?

38:00.300 --> 38:05.060
No, I mean if you take ten if you if a cat loses tail that cat is 10% off

38:05.060 --> 38:09.620
That's what I'm saying. So it doesn't make sense that you would have a value a value deal. Hmm

38:09.660 --> 38:17.340
Hey, did you know that Carla music from Bon Appetit is Lorenzo musics daughter-in-law crazy, huh? Thanks Wikipedia

38:17.340 --> 38:24.180
Now Griffin, did you hop on Wikipedia real quick to see if Lorenzo music was incredibly problematic

38:24.660 --> 38:27.180
No, I just wanted to see some cool pictures of Lorenzo music

38:27.340 --> 38:31.340
Okay, and I didn't I achieved my goal and I walked into you guys confuse Lorenzo

38:31.980 --> 38:36.540
Music with Lorenzo llamas probably never it's probably okay. Cool. Cool. Cool

38:37.420 --> 38:42.180
Hey, it's us again your old buddies your old begging buddies. Oh boy

38:43.020 --> 38:45.760
Justin Travis come to your hat and hand saying hey

38:45.760 --> 38:50.480
Hey, are you enjoying this? Is this good? Do you like Griffin's too proud?

38:50.680 --> 38:54.920
Griffin's too proud and too busy caring for an infant. That's another thing false

38:54.920 --> 39:00.800
You know, these babies don't feed themselves. Not yet. Eventually when they get older they will they will but they need you to

39:01.520 --> 39:07.160
Spring into action to buy all the different baby. It's been too long since I've had baby, you know babies

39:07.360 --> 39:11.080
Hey, no, but for real listen jokes leave the room get out of here jokes

39:11.080 --> 39:16.800
Yeah your jokes over the years your support has allowed us to do things like focus more on merch, right?

39:16.800 --> 39:18.520
If you've noticed that we've had more and more merch

39:18.520 --> 39:23.120
It's because we were able to like work with designers and spend more time focused on that

39:23.560 --> 39:28.020
If you have noticed like the shows have been sounding a little bit better, maybe a lot a bit better

39:28.040 --> 39:31.200
We've been able to hire an editor because of your support

39:31.200 --> 39:35.120
There's just things throughout where we've been able to kind of make the shows better

39:35.360 --> 39:37.160
Make them more of a focus for us

39:37.160 --> 39:43.880
Make sure we don't miss episodes when when we can all of that stuff tour when we were able to all of those things are

39:43.960 --> 39:49.760
Because of the support you shown us over the years. There is a direct improvement. Just listen

39:49.760 --> 39:51.680
Well, don't listen to the first hundred episodes

39:51.680 --> 39:53.680
But the audio quality from no

39:53.680 --> 40:00.920
But the audio quality from then to now is because your support has allowed us to get better and better equipment and it's just all

40:00.920 --> 40:06.720
Of those things, you know, the world can be tough sometimes and sometimes you wake up and you think I don't want to be funny today

40:06.720 --> 40:11.120
I don't be creative today, but then we know you're all out there depending on us to make these shows

I kind of do. Okay. Well, yeah, it just gives you a moment to talk to the people directly

41:23.800 --> 41:27.120
I do want to say just like two more things one if you're already

41:27.120 --> 41:33.380
Supporting max fun. Maybe this is the year you consider increasing that support. Maybe you've listened to more shows

Maybe you found that our shows are holding a more important place in your heart and you want to reflect that in your support

41:39.920 --> 41:44.560
You can do that too. You can upgrade your support level or if you want to give a little bit more

41:44.560 --> 41:46.520

It's so easy to think about it and then like 20 minutes from now

Why garlic parm like chicken wings?

44:26.280 --> 44:31.920

But why but why because CBD and parmesan tots, I guess

44:47.880 --> 44:54.240
Yeah, but at a certain point like if someone said here's some parmesan sauce and I crushed up some ibuprofen

44:56.880 --> 44:58.880
I wouldn't want that either

44:58.880 --> 45:07.200
What a delivery man this is headache this is headache destroying Buffalo barbecue

45:08.800 --> 45:13.000

This new game boy brushes your teeth while you play it. I don't

45:20.760 --> 45:25.560
If you eat a little bit of hot of your Honda Accords tires, it's also Claritin

45:25.560 --> 45:33.560
That's good, but why if your allergies are bothering you just get out there and on your tire the same what we're fucking talking about

45:33.920 --> 45:36.400
Cuz that is not the news right now

45:37.800 --> 45:44.940
The news right now in the world of QSR is everybody's every every's plant-based. Yeah. Oh, yeah. I love it

45:44.940 --> 45:48.920
Yeah, everybody's plant-based you like you know their salad or like a tomato

45:50.560 --> 45:52.560
No, sir, this is plant-based

45:52.560 --> 45:59.800
Taco Bell, so, you know that this is the end point of the whole trial Taco Bell is testing a

46:00.240 --> 46:01.680
proprietary

46:01.680 --> 46:05.680
boldly seasoned plant-based protein meat

The cravatarian taco feet it's and it says here in parentheses sounds like vegetarian

46:14.960 --> 46:22.280
Oh now listen, there's probably somebody in the executive board

46:22.600 --> 46:27.480
Who read that word and thought it said cravatrain and they needed a minute

46:28.800 --> 46:30.800
They need a special helper to help them

46:31.520 --> 46:36.760
Like the original crunchy taco supreme. Uh-huh. This take features shredded cheddar cheese

46:37.480 --> 46:43.160
Crisp lettuce diced tomatoes and reduced fat sour cream served in a crunchy corn shell

46:43.160 --> 46:51.180
Thank you, by the way for reducing the fat in this sour cream. I have a bunch a big spring in my step now

46:52.760 --> 46:57.960
Except now fans can experience Taco Bell's beloved taco in vegetarian form

46:58.160 --> 47:03.800
The cravatarian taco is currently testing at only one Taco Bell

47:03.800 --> 47:08.680

47:08.680 --> 47:13.160
until big market big market why

47:13.880 --> 47:20.840
Why would you put out a press release to say that if you go to this one bizarre-ass Taco Bell in a Californian city?

47:21.040 --> 47:26.600
They'll they'll serve you a vegetarian talk like that's why why does everybody need to know that?

47:26.600 --> 47:31.040
Well Justin they put out press releases when they open that new Guardians of the Galaxy ride at

47:31.520 --> 47:33.520
Disneyland and there's only one of those

47:33.520 --> 47:40.400
Yeah, that's a good point. That's almost a good point. It's like glances off being a good point. And I would also wager that this

47:41.320 --> 47:46.160
Proprietary Taco Bell turbo fake beef is gonna send you on a roller coaster ride of a different kind

47:50.040 --> 47:54.760
Hi, I'm turbo fake me the newest American gladiator

47:56.880 --> 48:00.400
Set a fucking land speed record cruising through your gut

48:00.400 --> 48:02.400
I

48:02.920 --> 48:06.800
It's gonna make a new in between your intestines

48:19.400 --> 48:22.840
The cravatarian taco is just one output of

48:23.440 --> 48:29.800
Taco Bell's innovation team as they've been busy making good on the brand's continued commitment to provide vegetarian options in

48:29.800 --> 48:35.400
2021 if you're keeping track so far that includes one vegetarian taco in California

48:35.560 --> 48:40.400
So it's going pretty good for me. Yeah, I guess hey, you guys are still working on that, right?

48:43.400 --> 48:45.240
It's in

48:45.240 --> 48:48.520
Tustin did you just make up a name? No, I'm sure no

48:48.520 --> 48:53.400
It's cuz your name is just your name's Dustin and I think you just said

48:54.360 --> 48:55.880
your own name

48:55.880 --> 49:00.560
The term cravatarian it feels compelled to outline here is

49:01.080 --> 49:07.600
Inspired by all of Taco Bell's craveable options. Yeah, and it emphasizes how no one should have to sacrifice

49:07.840 --> 49:10.920
Bold flavors for their lifestyle. It's okay

49:10.920 --> 49:15.600
It's fun to see the marketing person get their hand on the ball who came up with that term

49:15.760 --> 49:21.000
Like tell him how I thought of it. Hey, tell him how I thought it craved it. No, I think they'll get it

49:21.000 --> 49:25.800
I think Craig it's right there. No, but tell him cuz I'm like, this is the best thing I've ever done

49:25.960 --> 49:27.960
You have three kids Doug

49:28.520 --> 49:32.320
This is my fourth kid the cravatarian taco the Crava trip

49:32.320 --> 49:35.720
You know what? You actually said crave a train and I think I like that better

49:36.320 --> 49:38.320
Too late to dammit

49:38.680 --> 49:42.380
So that that is huge news. If you are near Tustin

49:43.200 --> 49:49.420
Then mail us one guys can get is there time for one is there time for one more very brief?

49:49.420 --> 49:54.840
Yeah, there's always time del taco created a Mexican pizza ghosted support hotline. Wait

49:55.800 --> 49:58.400
For the past several years the concept of ghosting

49:59.360 --> 50:05.080
When someone cuts off all communication without explanation, thank you so much has become an everyday phenomenon

50:05.400 --> 50:07.280
Not so much an everyday phenomenon

50:07.280 --> 50:12.840
I might editorialize that they don't have to parenthetically describe what the term means in the press release

50:12.840 --> 50:13.800
But no trust us

50:13.800 --> 50:20.180
It's an everyday phenomenon more than a year ago a certain tostada like menu item

50:20.600 --> 50:22.600
described as a Mexican pizza

50:23.720 --> 50:30.200
Disappeared from a major Mexican fast-food chain and fans took the social media and other do you see what's happening?

50:30.200 --> 50:34.400
Yeah, and other online platforms on moss to air their grief. No, no

50:34.920 --> 50:39.080
If they're airing their grievances about the Mexican pizza, I assume it is in the form of farts

50:39.080 --> 50:45.760
the request went unanswered leaving hundreds of thousands of consumers hangry sad and

50:46.400 --> 50:47.800
ghosted

50:47.800 --> 50:49.880
Okay, and so now a year later

50:50.520 --> 50:57.360
Yeah, Delta del taco restaurants with breakneck speed has is offering emotional and culinary

50:57.760 --> 51:02.800
Support to all those disappointed fans via a Mexican pizza ghosted

51:02.800 --> 51:09.380
Support hotline at one eight seven seven three ghosted fans can call the line

51:10.440 --> 51:13.980
24-7 Wow that persistent availability. I assume is

51:15.040 --> 51:21.920
Important because you never know when the grief of the Mexican pizza will hit you you can call 24-7 to receive guidance

51:22.720 --> 51:29.800
inspiration and a resolution for being wronged in the form of an exclusive promo code for a buy one

51:29.800 --> 51:33.240
Crunch Tata get one free from del taco

51:33.920 --> 51:35.000
through

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
May 20th, can I just say?

51:37.280 --> 51:43.800
we you have been doing bringing to us these months cards for quite a while and like sometimes I think like

51:44.120 --> 51:50.120
This is the most like throw it at the wall and see what sticks and then something else comes along and then something else comes

51:50.120 --> 51:54.240
like and I I'm now hesitant to say it but this feels like

51:54.240 --> 52:00.560
Just conceptually perhaps in many ways the wildest one, right?

52:00.560 --> 52:04.040
And I don't I think it's the time frame. I think it's the idea

52:04.880 --> 52:10.760
This is it's it's like when somebody like slams you and then like later that night

52:10.760 --> 52:14.180
You're brushing your teeth and you think of a really good retort only in this case

52:14.680 --> 52:20.240
The slam wasn't against you wasn't a slam and your resort

52:20.920 --> 52:23.160
your retort is to come up with a

52:23.160 --> 52:26.240
Emotional support hotline for the people who feel

52:26.840 --> 52:33.520
Slighted by the slam it is it is as if a kid said to another kid like you look dumb today

52:33.840 --> 52:39.240
Yeah, and you a third party unrelated to the scenario nine months later

52:39.720 --> 52:43.240
Went to the insulted kid and said hey, do you need to talk about that?

52:43.240 --> 52:46.520
I went I don't fucking remember what you're talking about

52:47.880 --> 52:49.800
What they have what?

52:49.800 --> 52:53.120
So you would think that they'll taco would be like

52:54.160 --> 52:57.520
So we're doing Mexican pizza, right? Fuck you

52:58.320 --> 52:59.620
but

52:59.620 --> 53:06.560
Del taco doesn't I guess they don't have the guts because they do have this thing that's called a crunch tada. That's like

53:08.040 --> 53:10.040
You know around

53:10.280 --> 53:11.600
Shit, it looks like I miss you

53:11.600 --> 53:17.000
It looks like the Taco Bell Mexican pizza Mexican pizza is not an existing right world is an invention of Taco Bell

53:17.000 --> 53:22.080
so I they don't call it the Mexican pizza what they're saying is like

53:22.080 --> 53:27.560
We have something sort of like the Mexican pizza. Do you want to call this 1-800 number about it?

53:27.560 --> 53:28.320
Yeah

53:28.320 --> 53:34.280
We can make the connection in your head that these two things are sort of the same thing you can come to Delta

53:34.840 --> 53:37.320
Tim hack Bart. You guys know him. He's the CMO over there

53:37.320 --> 53:38.320
Don't talk. Yeah, of course

53:38.320 --> 53:44.440
Don't taco is more than happy to fill the Mexican pizza void and meet the obvious pinup consumer demand

53:44.440 --> 53:49.400
However, instead of just meeting expectations with a single crunch tada

53:49.600 --> 53:56.480
We went further by offering a variety that'll appeal to vegetarian. Do you mean cravatarian?

53:59.240 --> 54:05.460
Trains if you are vegetarian, did you describe yourself as anything other than a cravatarian? You don't you're not living

54:06.120 --> 54:08.120
beef and chicken fans

54:08.880 --> 54:13.440
Think of myself as a chicken fan all three crunch tadas highlight our

54:13.440 --> 54:14.800
um

54:14.800 --> 54:21.440
Quick service restaurant plus positioning with quality ingredients like our fresh house-made guacamole

54:21.800 --> 54:24.560
fresh from scratch slow-cooked beans and

54:25.000 --> 54:30.600
Signature queso blanco while offering guests best-in-class value for the money on top of a large

54:31.000 --> 54:35.880
Six and a half inch freshly fried tortilla, so it's like a Mexican pizza

54:36.680 --> 54:38.760
So what it is is a nice

54:38.760 --> 54:45.380
Pizza, well, no, here's what happened is that they wanted to get into the Mexican pizza game by which I mean the fucking tostada game

54:45.800 --> 54:49.080
Which is to the tostadas, which is to start us

54:49.240 --> 54:55.760
But they can't but they know if they just call it to start as people aren't gonna know that there's instantly instantly

54:55.760 --> 55:00.000
There are certain people I should say that aren't gonna know they're talking about Taco Bell's amazing

55:00.080 --> 55:06.680
Mexican pizzas and so this is their way of kind of having their Mexican pizza and calling it a tostada and then also eating

55:06.680 --> 55:10.620
It too and I got to do something. I'm also not calling

55:11.480 --> 55:17.040
Still the belligerence on display here. It's like no one would ever know what a tostada

55:17.040 --> 55:19.080
Yeah, we have to call the crunch tada

55:19.080 --> 55:24.640
So they want to eat it now have you called the number yet because I have it loaded up on my phone

55:24.640 --> 55:29.440
I just want to know it's definitely wait. Wait, can you you know me though? I can yeah

55:29.840 --> 55:35.680
We can get a call going right here. I know for sure. It's gonna be a robot area answering. I better be

55:35.680 --> 55:40.920
Oh god, yeah, I don't think I could actually handle if it's a real if nothing else

55:40.920 --> 55:45.720
Just the idea of a human being have to be on call 24-7 for that number 24-7

55:45.720 --> 55:49.720
Yeah, the 24-7 thing. It does make me think that it'll be recording. But hey, we can treat ourselves

55:50.840 --> 55:52.840
One second. Okay

55:52.840 --> 55:58.840
Yeah, okay

55:59.800 --> 56:05.400
Okay, so we called and it was a real human being and that I don't it they it was not a conversation

56:06.080 --> 56:08.980
It was just someone telling us about a Del Taco promotion

56:08.980 --> 56:14.960
So I we spared you the the very lengthy script that was read to hey and and let's spare them too

56:14.960 --> 56:18.400
Cuz we said like what the number is the numbers there in the press release

56:18.400 --> 56:23.280
You can find it. Even if you didn't catch him we say don't call it a human being will have to talk

56:23.280 --> 56:27.400
But what if you're creating what if by calling you're being a job creator? I don't actually know

56:29.800 --> 56:31.800
I'm moving on

56:32.120 --> 56:34.120
Do you guys want a quick Yahoo real quick?

56:36.440 --> 56:40.680
Yes, another gram robot joint thanks Graham, it's a question mark Yahoo answers use your question mark

56:41.600 --> 56:43.600
I'll call them Dell asks

56:43.760 --> 56:45.760
canned BLT

56:45.760 --> 56:51.760
Hi, hi all I have gave recently started reading a book about the ways of preservation through cannon

56:52.760 --> 56:57.920
It seems like you can meet and cheeses and veggies and vegetables

56:57.920 --> 57:03.840
But almost everything it is possible then for me to try and can a BLT just a thought

57:03.840 --> 57:06.880
Here's my idea toast the bread add the mayo add the tomato

57:07.240 --> 57:12.400
But add lots of salt to help with preserving add the bacon then the lettuce then put it all on the bread

57:12.400 --> 57:18.240
Then I can put it in not a can and vacuum all the air out. So the bacteria can't breathe

57:18.640 --> 57:23.960
Then I put the lid on and boil the jar. Well this work or will the male make the bread soggy over time?

57:23.960 --> 57:27.680
Thanks. I'm new to canning, but I want to become a master. I

57:28.840 --> 57:30.840
think

57:30.960 --> 57:34.480
Boy if you put it in a

57:34.480 --> 57:42.600
Jaw a can a jar and you vacuum and you vacuum all the air out. So the bacteria can't breathe

57:43.320 --> 57:45.320
Does that kind of stasis lock?

57:46.280 --> 57:53.400
There's a there's a sort of osmosis. I'm worried about of mayo encroaching into the breadlands mayo and tomato

57:53.400 --> 57:55.400
Let's be honest tomatoes very

57:55.520 --> 57:57.520
very wet

57:57.520 --> 58:03.240
Um, could you dehydrate both the tomato and the mayonnaise?

58:03.240 --> 58:07.400
Oh, that's fun and then rehydrate them with some sort of eyedropper

58:08.320 --> 58:10.320
later in the process I

58:11.040 --> 58:14.900
Mean there are canned hamburgers. Yeah. Yeah, this is no

58:16.000 --> 58:19.480
Can we make those with the technology of our homes?

58:20.120 --> 58:25.080
Do you know what I mean? Like here's what here's it and they specifically asked about a BLT

58:25.080 --> 58:29.080
Yeah, right here would be my issue. Okay when

58:30.080 --> 58:32.080
McDonald's launched the McDLT

58:32.920 --> 58:34.720
They were so

58:34.720 --> 58:35.960
flummoxed

58:35.960 --> 58:43.320
by the tech like the the prime the like perfect BLT experience that they created a

58:43.760 --> 58:45.760
two-prong

58:45.960 --> 58:49.600
Styrofoam container in a real fuck you to mama Nate, right?

58:50.120 --> 58:53.960
Which kept the hot side as Jason Alexander told us in

58:53.960 --> 58:55.200
in

58:55.200 --> 58:58.920
That famous ad it kept the hot side hot and kept the cool side. Cool

58:58.920 --> 59:04.120
Yeah, so McDonald's in their infinite wisdom could not master this technology

59:04.600 --> 59:07.760
Certainly certainly us at home. It's too well beyond

59:08.280 --> 59:10.400
No, thanks. Well, I'm gonna be able to preserve

59:10.400 --> 59:15.560
I think the problem is is that it gives you too much time to think about the BLT itself

59:15.560 --> 59:18.160
Which as a functional sandwich is great

59:18.160 --> 59:23.980
Okay. No, but I mean like you there's quick quick right bacon lettuce to me

59:23.980 --> 59:27.700
It's quick quick and easy, right? It is a functional sandwich

59:27.820 --> 59:32.700
But as far as like there's no bells and whistles and a BLT. There's nothing it's not

59:33.180 --> 59:35.900
It's not gonna change the world of BLT. It's not

59:36.780 --> 59:41.700
Revolutionary, so I'm saying you're going to a lot of work to preserve a BLT

59:41.700 --> 59:43.700
I'm just saying I think that there are better

59:43.700 --> 59:50.620
More interesting options that one could do and be excited later in the in the apocalypse to find

59:50.620 --> 59:54.060
You know your canned croque monsieur, right?

59:54.740 --> 59:56.500
LT is a

59:56.500 --> 59:59.180
Bullshit sandwich. You can't take a club Sam

01:00:01.020 --> 01:00:05.420
Sandwich and take one of the components off of it and then call it a different

01:00:06.020 --> 01:00:11.160
Even more desirable sandwich. It's it can't happen like that the BLT

01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:15.880
Who it's disgusting those three. I was trying to answer around that Griffin

01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:19.000
I didn't want the BLT dancing around it for too fucking long

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:24.680
Like it's you can't just give something a name and then it's this it's a real sandwich

01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:31.600
Bacon isn't enough to be the star of a sandwich show like it just isn't it's a friend that helps. Sorry Griffin

01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:37.080
Can you say that very pleasing sentence again? Bacon isn't enough to be the star of the sandwich show

01:00:37.080 --> 01:00:39.080
Oh

01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:46.840
Now let's talk but here's the thing I you can can a BLT right cuz you can can can can can

01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:49.800
I really don't like doing the show some days. I

01:00:56.720 --> 01:00:59.000
Forgot I even forget what I was gonna oh, yeah

01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:05.360
If we tweak a little bit our definition of the word

01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:06.600
preservation

01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:07.880
I

01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:10.640
Think that the answer to this can be a firm. Yes

01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:14.800
Can you can you can a BLT? Yes, you sure? Yes

01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:19.300
Absolutely, and it will be in there and stuff's gonna happen to it and when you open it later

01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:22.040
It something will be there

01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:27.400
Do you know what? I mean? Maybe not in the original sort of talking more of like a time capsule

01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:34.920
Scenario. Yeah, the matter itself is preserved the flavor and texture maybe not

01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:39.960
It'll be different texturally and flavor Lily and not in a great way

01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:44.160
I bet but no you might have done a new society in there, right?

01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:51.360
Yeah, it might be a little fucking Whoville down there a little little tiny mayor talking to you. Who knows the Mayo. Oh

01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:54.240
Travis you're on fire, baby

01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:58.360
Yeah, baby, but you know what that means? It's time to wrap up. Yep

01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:05.640
Once Travis gets too hot. We got to go out. So he's on top. Yeah, can't use it all up. Leave him one more. Let's go

01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:07.680
All right

01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:10.880
That is gonna do it for us. Thank you so much again one last time

01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:13.600
maximum fun org forward slash join

01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:19.000

01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:23.720
Wow, please help us out. We really appreciate it
