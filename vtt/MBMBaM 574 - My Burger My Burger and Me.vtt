00:00.000 --> 00:04.820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

00:05.760 --> 00:10.580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

00:11.480 --> 00:17.660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

00:17.660 --> 00:30.660
What's up, you cool, baby?

00:47.660 --> 00:50.060
It's better it's better with you

00:53.980 --> 00:56.060
It's better it's better with you

01:00.260 --> 01:02.260
Better it's better with you

01:10.180 --> 01:14.740

I'm your middlest brother big dog woof woof Travis woof woof McElroy woof woof that was I'm Griffin McElroy

That's a lot of business. I couldn't remember where the woof woofs went if I'm being yeah

01:28.940 --> 01:36.100
I just throw them in between every word I do it better say sorry. Hey guys guys. Yeah. Yeah guys. Did you hear about the spice?

01:37.380 --> 01:39.380
The spice is nice this this

01:39.380 --> 01:45.140
Small thumb what I was good. It must flow is I don't think at any point in dune do they say spice is nice

01:45.140 --> 01:48.500
That's my rice nice. This is nice

01:48.940 --> 01:54.060
Give me that spice on some shaved ice cuz it's nice. I am spices nice

01:54.460 --> 01:58.140
Y'all y'all have expressed interest in doing a dune based

01:59.500 --> 02:04.260
Introduction. Yeah, and I must warn you that of my knowledge of

02:05.140 --> 02:07.140
the works

02:07.140 --> 02:12.540
Are not comprehensive and so I might be able to hop in there from time to time and be like those big worms

02:12.540 --> 02:14.940
I bet there's people on the internet

02:16.140 --> 02:18.140
Who that makes?

02:18.180 --> 02:19.820
horny of them

02:19.820 --> 02:23.180
Which is like about the depths that I will be able to plumb with it

02:23.180 --> 02:24.900
But all those big worms, you know

02:24.900 --> 02:30.440
There's some people to see those and get horny off of them. Here's what I just wanted to say about this one

02:31.100 --> 02:33.060
now I my

02:33.060 --> 02:34.620
sort of

02:34.620 --> 02:40.160
Expertise in dune is that I read the first quarter of the first book

02:40.420 --> 02:46.360
Yeah, and said this isn't for me boring. This bike didn't say boring. I didn't fucking say

02:49.860 --> 02:51.860
Attive thing a lot of people really loved it

02:53.340 --> 02:58.040
The director of the movie Dennis villain villain you

02:58.840 --> 03:01.960
Which is like already a little delectable. Yeah, you know what I mean?

03:01.960 --> 03:07.280
He said he's basically really mad that they're gonna put dune on TV

03:07.280 --> 03:08.320
Oh, yeah

03:08.320 --> 03:12.540
When it's also going the movies and I feel like this is a debate that we have not gotten a way in on

03:12.720 --> 03:14.720
Yeah, wait in on this

03:15.760 --> 03:19.200
Dennis Dennis, I hear you and he doesn't want

03:20.000 --> 03:26.900
Dennis doesn't want you to watch dune on TV if you show he says it's not just a product. It's church, right?

03:26.900 --> 03:31.220
Oh gross, I don't go to church either Dennis

03:32.820 --> 03:39.420
Movie more than I go to church Dennis Dennis maybe churches the movies, you know, it's not churches movies

03:39.540 --> 03:42.760
He wrote this is what he said to variety

03:42.760 --> 03:46.940
He wrote an open letter about how dunes on TV and he says that AT&T

03:47.420 --> 03:51.040
Hijacked one of the most respectable and important studios in film history

03:51.040 --> 03:54.620
There's absolutely no love for cinema nor the audience

03:54.620 --> 03:57.100
the what he said is watching a

03:57.940 --> 04:05.180
Film on a TV screen is of lesser value. He said the way it happened. I'm still not happy frankly

04:06.640 --> 04:12.060
Frankly, so I wasn't angry though frankly to watch dune on a television

04:12.620 --> 04:18.840
The best way I can compare it is to drive a speedboat your bathtub. Whoa, that's awesome

04:18.840 --> 04:23.320
That's what that's Dennis don't make it sound so good. That sounds awesome. Dennis

04:24.680 --> 04:32.120
Dennis the problem with your metaphor there or a simile is that a speedboat in your bathtub would not scale unless

04:32.800 --> 04:35.680
You're talking about a Stuart little ask situation

04:35.720 --> 04:36.200
Yeah

04:36.200 --> 04:41.860
Which the bathtub is scaled down to the bathtub and I'm Stuart little slice because when I put dune on TV

04:41.860 --> 04:45.720
It's not gonna be like super zoomed in on Oscar Isaac's nose, right?

04:45.720 --> 04:50.300
Like I'm gonna be able to see the whole thing, but on the other hand on the other hand

04:50.400 --> 04:54.120
Do not watch it on an IMAX. Here's the thing folks

04:54.640 --> 04:56.640
Dennis made these worms

04:57.000 --> 05:02.680
To be a specific big size. Yeah, when you watch the worms on your TV or

05:03.160 --> 05:05.440
Christ forbid it your phone

05:06.200 --> 05:12.520
Those worms look little they look like little that's like a snake that you could step on and hurt it and you can't do that

05:12.520 --> 05:15.880
Cuz the worm is too big but on an IMAX screen the people that's

05:16.640 --> 05:22.360
Way too big the worm is at that point. Yeah, I was no one's gonna believe there's a worm that big

05:22.520 --> 05:24.920
When I watch June on my tablet

05:24.920 --> 05:29.800
I'm like, why are those borrowers fighting that earthworm because I don't understand scale

05:30.360 --> 05:37.440
Zendaya so small so little so little here's what I'll say to Dennis though that perhaps Dennis isn't considering

05:38.400 --> 05:40.400
TVs these days as big

05:40.400 --> 05:43.900
They are getting bigger pretty big. I said like my TV

05:43.960 --> 05:50.560
It's pretty big now if this was old school where we had that one tube TV that I think in real life was like a 12

05:50.560 --> 05:54.520
Inch screen but the box like the the case that it was in was like three feet wide

05:55.240 --> 05:57.080
Then like yeah, I get it Dennis

05:57.080 --> 06:01.880
I don't want to watch fucking Timothy Chalamet's beautiful face on that tiny shitty black mirror

06:02.000 --> 06:08.920
But on my big TV now, it's getting close in that it's pretty big and I sit super close to it Dennis

06:08.920 --> 06:12.240
I'm right up on it. So the aspect ratio is about the same

06:12.800 --> 06:17.240
How to hold on if we could pause for 30 seconds. I'm here with celebrity correspondent David Lynch

06:17.240 --> 06:21.000
You just wanted to weigh in on this impossible now if you're playing

06:21.840 --> 06:23.840
the movie on a

06:24.040 --> 06:28.560
Telephone you will never in a trillion years

06:30.400 --> 06:34.500
Experience the film you'll think you have experienced it

06:35.400 --> 06:37.280
But you'll be

06:37.280 --> 06:43.160
Cheated it's a such a sadness that you think you've seen a film on your

06:44.000 --> 06:45.880
fucking telephone

06:45.880 --> 06:47.480
Get real

06:47.480 --> 06:53.200
Okay, so that's sort of where Dave's at. Thank you David for coming into the studio with that. I really appreciate it

06:53.200 --> 06:58.760
I'm gonna completely miss the point for a second and say that my favorite moment in there and is when you can hear him start

06:58.760 --> 07:04.000
To think to say billion, but then he's like nah. No, no, no, David, David, David

07:04.000 --> 07:08.000
Trillius trillion years that'll get the point across

07:09.480 --> 07:11.480
Timothy Chalamet's not a big dude

07:11.840 --> 07:17.600
He could get what you could lose him in the action on the phone. I haven't seen the dune film because it's not out yet

07:18.280 --> 07:20.280
and

07:20.400 --> 07:26.560
Frankly, I they got it right with the sting vert like they got it in one with sting and fucking aging tale Cooper

07:26.560 --> 07:31.200
Like yeah, you're not gonna beat that but good luck but on a phone to me Chalamet. Where is he?

07:31.200 --> 07:35.000
He is two pixels tall. I do not see the boy. I do not

07:36.240 --> 07:41.580
Although it is the most I've ever felt capable that I could take Jason Momoa in a fight

07:41.720 --> 07:45.080
Like I think I flick him across the table like a football

07:45.640 --> 07:51.080
Angry Birds Angry Birds, Aquaman's ass right out the phone. Get out of here. Get out of here now

07:51.080 --> 07:55.640
You're in the yard. I wish it's true because when you see the old version of dune on screen

07:55.640 --> 07:58.120
I'm like, oh Patrick Stewart looks gigantic, right?

07:58.120 --> 08:04.320
Oh, look how huge he is, but then I go and I see Jason Momoa's ass in that tiny ass phone. I'm like, oh, yeah

08:04.320 --> 08:08.600
Yeah, no, I could squish that boy. I could squish that man. Look at him. Look at that. Travis could swish

08:09.920 --> 08:16.840
Could swish he can pick Jason Momoa up and swish him nothing but net. Oh, no problem. No problem there

08:17.280 --> 08:19.920
Absolutely, I could don't even get don't even get it started

08:19.920 --> 08:24.800
So don't see if you see dune on TV if you see dune on TV take yourself to jail

08:24.800 --> 08:28.000
Unless you admit yourself to jail unless

08:28.560 --> 08:34.360
Unless you string a bunch of TVs together like in blank check the movie and you can watch it

08:34.360 --> 08:38.520
That's awesome. Like a big you had a bunch of friends together and lamb

08:39.120 --> 08:42.840
Party your TVs together. That's good. Just watch it

08:42.840 --> 08:45.920
So watch TV is one chunk of TimothÃ©e Chalamet's face

08:46.440 --> 08:48.760
Right and and decide ahead of time

08:48.800 --> 08:54.280
Which part of which TV is gonna be the face because you don't want everybody to be like the nose or something

08:54.280 --> 08:58.080
That would be so embarrassing, right? You want to be like, I'm the nose you guys are the eyes

08:58.080 --> 09:05.880
Let's vulture on this shit and get Timothy Chalamet's face up on the big screen like Dennis intended and I'm just gonna say I'm I've been

09:05.880 --> 09:09.880
This is like not relevant to me cuz I've been boycotting the movie

09:09.880 --> 09:15.040
You guys know since they announced that Stellan Skarsgard was gonna play Baron Harkonnen and not Mike Myers like I've been requesting

09:16.160 --> 09:17.920
So many years

09:17.920 --> 09:25.200
Absolutely. I wanted Mike Myers play all the parts, but but they wouldn't they said he I was just but have you tried saying out loud?

09:25.640 --> 09:27.640
Stellan Skarsgard

09:28.080 --> 09:30.080
I'm gonna bring my screaming

09:30.520 --> 09:36.600
Four month old and four year old to the theaters. Everybody's gonna be like, why did you bring these fucking kids to dune?

09:36.600 --> 09:42.960
I'll be like Dennis made me I wanted to watch it at home like like a normal person

09:42.960 --> 09:48.800
But apparently this is a Christ like experience. I just hope there's enough fucking I just hope there's enough

09:49.040 --> 09:50.720
Stellan in there to satisfy my kids

09:50.720 --> 09:52.840
I don't want it to be another another

09:53.200 --> 09:58.920
Situation like like Jungle Cruise where they got Giamatti right at the beginning and then Giamatti disappears for large swaths

09:58.920 --> 10:01.280
It's only this is yeah, this is what I'll say Justin

10:01.280 --> 10:05.720
I'm still glad that you brought Jungle Cruise back into it because I watched Jungle Cruise at home and I can't imagine

10:05.920 --> 10:10.440
How much harder I would have cried if I saw it in theaters, you know what I mean? So I'm kind of glad

10:10.440 --> 10:15.560
Yes, then I'm able to sit at home and have a muted emotional experience because God knows sometimes

10:15.880 --> 10:21.280
You know the the waterworks they just open and by the end of it you're dried out like spongebob in the Sun

10:21.480 --> 10:23.880
And I don't want that, you know what I mean?

10:23.880 --> 10:28.760
So like it's nice to be able to mute my emotions in watching say a Jungle Cruise

10:29.320 --> 10:31.160
or a

10:31.160 --> 10:38.720
Dune at home because the spice must flow but so must the tears the tears must also and I like that's the thing about home

10:38.720 --> 10:43.360
Viewing that you're not gonna beat Dennis when I watched Chernobyl now with my kids

10:43.360 --> 10:46.400
Yeah, yeah, yeah, and they were like, who's that great guy?

10:46.400 --> 10:52.480
I was like, that's that is Stellan Skarsgard and then like happens in so many movies. He was gone for a long time

10:52.480 --> 10:58.040
He wasn't on the screen. I could fast forward to the next scene. Yeah, and that's in the special feature

10:58.040 --> 11:08.960
So you can just watch these guys the sing-along the sing-along Skarsgard cut. Yeah for sure. They call it the scar rated version

11:09.480 --> 11:14.560
Right, it's pretty good that was ten minutes we're free. All right, we did it. Congratulations everybody

11:16.040 --> 11:22.760
We are going to answer your questions now and turn them alchemy like into wisdom. That's what we do. This is our core competency

11:23.320 --> 11:25.800
Well, it's our it's our it's our USP

11:25.800 --> 11:27.800
unique selling point

11:28.200 --> 11:34.960
Guys, all right. No other podcast has done it. You know the podcast will ever do it. Okay, because I know he has a fucking gun

11:34.960 --> 11:41.800
Oh, all right. I'm so I'm just really it's been a while you sound amped up. I'm fucking stuck

11:42.120 --> 11:49.040
This is the thing we switched to the morning record. Yeah, now I'm so chised on coffee. Yeah, you know, I mean

11:49.600 --> 11:50.920
who I

11:50.920 --> 11:54.320
work at a local deli that also serves ice cream even that's a

11:54.320 --> 11:58.280
Vodka, yeah, sure a thousand things. I could say all right, you know

11:58.280 --> 12:03.280
Yeah, well, that's that's using a lot like listen to like listen, like, um

12:03.920 --> 12:10.440
You think they have a bologna flavored ice cream over here. Awesome. Come on. I've heard of creamed beef, but this

12:10.980 --> 12:12.020
Come on

12:12.020 --> 12:16.080
You're doing great stuff over there. But you know Justin's on fire. I need to give Justin

12:17.120 --> 12:19.120
You're right. Get out of the way

12:19.120 --> 12:24.700
Listen when MJ's on fire you give him the basketball or the microphone depending on which MJ

12:25.260 --> 12:31.100
You're talking about you're discussing. Yeah now Justin. Yeah, do you sort of or the gun to shoot zombies if it's me?

12:31.100 --> 12:37.200
Oh, right, right, right, right. Give me one more Justin, but make it more focused on the ice cream and less on the bologna

12:37.720 --> 12:40.720
Okay. Yeah, you know what? I like is a nice

12:41.380 --> 12:43.380
locks and then a schmear of

12:43.380 --> 12:48.580
Neapolitan. Oh, that's smooth. Yeah, that's perfect. Shit. Yeah, fuck. I

12:51.100 --> 12:54.620
Work at a local deli that also serves ice cream. Nice. I was

12:55.700 --> 13:00.120
Helping out behind the ice cream County yesterday and while talking to my co-worker about milkshakes

13:00.120 --> 13:03.660
I mentioned that I'm not the best person to talk to you because I'm lactose intolerant

13:04.220 --> 13:06.900
Without missing a beat. He said yeah, it makes sense. I

13:06.900 --> 13:13.300
I of course asked what he meant and he was immediately told me I don't know

13:13.300 --> 13:17.100
You just look like you don't do dairy. Was this an insult? Yes

13:17.100 --> 13:23.780
How do I make myself naturally look like I not only can eat but frequently consume milk?

13:23.780 --> 13:28.160
That's from befuddled in Bellingham. Why would you want that?

13:28.620 --> 13:32.020
Why do you want a milk milk is poisoned on your body?

13:32.020 --> 13:38.340
Why do you want that no Griffin because you see there's some people that have been picking on me

13:38.340 --> 13:44.540
But I've been drinking my milk and pretty soon. I'm gonna be a big tough guy and I'm gonna murder all of them

13:44.540 --> 13:48.420
I don't remember how the commercial goes, but it's basically something like that. It was something like that

13:48.420 --> 13:51.900
Yeah, it was a little boy the milk mustache saying bidet reckoning

13:55.540 --> 14:00.020
You've missed an important sentence in this thing, which is that they are lactose intolerant

14:00.020 --> 14:05.300
So like if I'm at a party and somebody's like cheap Griffin you haven't even looked at the cheese ball

14:05.940 --> 14:12.500
Then I'm gonna have to say well, yeah, because it'll make me fart and shit weird and I'll seem like a total creepazoid

14:12.500 --> 14:14.740
I would rather just avoid that entirely

14:15.540 --> 14:19.440
Assume that about me. You're missing the point. The question asker is not asking

14:19.440 --> 14:23.020
How do I make myself eat this food which is poisoned to my guts?

14:23.380 --> 14:28.620
It is how do I make myself up here to be someone who eats this food?

14:28.620 --> 14:32.900
That is poison in my guts so that I might pass without trace throughout society

14:33.380 --> 14:35.540
So that people you're okay

14:36.240 --> 14:42.340
Travis this is an intractable position that we have found ourselves in because I am saying if you give that off

14:42.340 --> 14:45.020
But you can't if you're writing those checks

14:45.540 --> 14:50.900
People are gonna tell you to cash them and when they tell you to cash them you will have to say I can't because of what?

14:50.900 --> 14:55.860
It does to my stomach and my butt and the toys. Oh my god Griffin. You're missing the most obvious answer

14:55.860 --> 14:58.340
Become an expert at sleight-of-hand

14:59.820 --> 15:01.820
Okay, they make

15:02.860 --> 15:09.820
Newspaper, yes, right the newspaper code and dump it in and then the stuffs but in this case the newspaper cone is your mouth

15:10.540 --> 15:14.060
Okay, when the when the magic's guys

15:14.780 --> 15:20.580
Do the trick where they pour the milk down the newspaper cone, uh-huh, and then it's gone

15:20.820 --> 15:25.340
Yeah, that's making a mess somewhere right in a different dimension

15:25.340 --> 15:32.460
Yeah, I mean jokes out of the room. There's no they're not pouring it into a fucking wormhole like they're pouring milk

15:32.460 --> 15:35.260
What a newspaper come let's say let's put it this way

15:37.020 --> 15:42.820
When the magician pour the milk into the newspaper code and then you make it disappear. Yeah, someone

15:43.540 --> 15:47.660
Will be cleaning that up who will not at the end receive applause

15:48.700 --> 15:52.060
When they're doing their stage show there is a techie

15:52.060 --> 15:56.500
There is some kind of feeder professional standing off the wings going don't do the milk. Don't do the milks

16:00.500 --> 16:03.140
I don't want to I hope no one thinks I'm

16:06.820 --> 16:14.140
It's like in the prestige when Michael Caine revealed like no we we straight-up murder a bird like every single night

16:14.900 --> 16:18.080
This is that somebody's like damn, where does the milk go though? And you're like

16:18.080 --> 16:21.940
He and you stain on the floor. I'm sweeping up the birds

16:24.400 --> 16:27.600
It's a living I don't I I

16:28.280 --> 16:32.480
I would not want this. I don't I don't know why you want this

16:32.720 --> 16:37.040
It's not most people I feel like aren't doing milk these days, huh?

16:37.040 --> 16:42.520
I think that the problem is is that I think that lactose intolerant makes it seem like a weakness

16:42.520 --> 16:49.080
instead of like saying like, oh no, my body rejects that point like I think it needs a

16:49.480 --> 16:56.480
Rebranding is what it is rather than like I can't drink milk. My body has evolved beyond the need for milk

16:56.920 --> 17:04.000
Right. That's a good way. We need something that makes it more like oh, you're not lactose intolerant. Oh my god. I'm so sorry

17:04.560 --> 17:10.160
It's but it's like this is not a judge about people who are still rocking that dairy life. Go for it

17:10.160 --> 17:13.720
Santa your truth. I'm proud of you, but there's so much stuff you can eat

17:14.040 --> 17:19.600
No one's gonna come up to you and be like you don't eat the cheese and milk and you're like not there's other stuff

17:19.960 --> 17:25.740
There's like lots of stuff that you can eat. There's lots of stuff you can eat. That's a actually a great point graph

17:26.880 --> 17:34.000
Thanks juice, especially at the deli like, you know, I mean, yeah. Yeah. Can we approach the wizard?

17:34.000 --> 17:40.280
Can we approach his humble yourself? I've actually been practicing a little dance for the wizard do your dance

17:40.280 --> 17:43.840
I'm gonna genuflect and let's all appease the wizard of the cloud

17:51.960 --> 17:56.000
Why did you get that tired cuz it was you didn't do that much

17:56.560 --> 18:02.520
I'm really out of shape different. So I want to tell you all how to get out of a sticky situation

18:02.520 --> 18:05.960
I think we've all been in from time to time too much on

18:06.600 --> 18:08.600
No, no

18:08.760 --> 18:16.720
You're out in the desert. Yeah, and you're riding on your camel. Yeah looking for

18:18.280 --> 18:26.380
The mummy's crypt sure sure sure to get the golden treasure. I'm with Brendan Fraser and reach one of the Fraser's there, but then

18:26.380 --> 18:34.860
Uh, you know Brent Fraser sees a sees a bad mummy and shoots it with his gun that kills mummies

18:34.860 --> 18:40.620
Oh, okay, and and when that happens, it's loud right and your camel goes fuck this. I'm

18:41.340 --> 18:46.580
Scared. Yeah. Yeah, so I want to read to y'all how to regain control of a spooked camel

18:47.620 --> 18:49.620
Sent this in. Thank you, Holland

18:50.260 --> 18:54.020
Just to quickly like sort of summarize a lot of the things that I'm gonna say here

18:54.020 --> 18:58.780
Be just be chill about it. Yeah, cuz if you're not chill

18:59.540 --> 19:06.220
Your camel's gonna know that it can also be not chill and get and get and sort of wild out

19:06.220 --> 19:12.860
Hey Griffin, if I could just ask if you could get to the point. This is actually very timely for me. Oh shit. Okay

19:12.860 --> 19:16.900
Yeah, like this is actually a going concern right now, right?

19:16.900 --> 19:22.220
Okay, camels are very intuitive creatures. If they sense your anxiety or anger, they will get more spooked your anger

19:22.220 --> 19:24.220
Fuck you camel. Stand still

19:24.220 --> 19:29.220
It's important to manage your emotions, even if you're scared out of your mind. So focus on your breathing

19:30.220 --> 19:34.780
Some people find that breathing in quick quickly and exhaling slowly helps them feel calmer

19:34.780 --> 19:40.300
Huh other people find breathing in and out on counts of three helps that's so you've given me nothing here

19:41.940 --> 19:47.540
Which of those those are two different things. Hey, yeah, but Travis listen remember camels they are calm by nature

19:47.540 --> 19:49.540
They're not naughty by nature like a lot of

19:49.540 --> 19:52.620
The animals of God's God's domain like a lot of

19:53.620 --> 19:54.620
ungulates

19:54.620 --> 19:56.620
ungulate anyway

19:56.620 --> 20:00.260
It it will eventually regain its composure. You just when you're in the shit

20:00.260 --> 20:04.300
Remember, you're not always gonna be in there because the camel wants to calm down, right?

20:05.740 --> 20:09.820
Not this one Reggie is kind of going he's wilding out

20:10.140 --> 20:16.460
He is now Travis, but he wants to be calm. So talk to the camel softly. Don't ever raise your voice at it Reggie

20:16.460 --> 20:19.660
Reggie, you've trampled Reggie. You've trampled my child

20:20.140 --> 20:25.700
Please destroy this bizarre that we found ourselves in if you could just chill out. This is a lot of money

20:25.700 --> 20:30.940
You're going to cost me. I just want to see if there really is water inside of your hump

20:30.940 --> 20:34.060
Yeah, myself really. Oh, that's number four. Don't poke a

20:34.620 --> 20:38.780
Poke a straw into its hump trying to drink it up like a Capri Sun it says right here

20:38.780 --> 20:43.020
Hey, it says that has never worked stop drinking that mountain. Do you co-read Reggie?

20:43.020 --> 20:46.700
Go calm down, buddy. You've got gamer you've got gamer

20:47.340 --> 20:52.940
Energy man, this and you can't get you can't expunge that cuz you can't game

20:52.940 --> 20:57.020
You got don't kick or hurt the camel as an attempt to slow it down. I would never

20:57.900 --> 21:01.700
If you want the camel to trust you he has to look at you like a friend not an enemy

21:01.700 --> 21:06.460
I mean, but I'm writing but here's I don't I need the camera to my friends

21:06.460 --> 21:12.020
I need the camel to respect me like I'm not gonna hurt or kick the camel, but I need the camel to respect me

21:12.020 --> 21:17.660
Or kick the camel, but the idea that I'm its friend like you can't be a friend and a father to your camel

21:17.660 --> 21:20.840
You know what? I mean? Sometimes I arm wrestle Reggie just to remind them

21:21.740 --> 21:25.740
Has to know maintain a firm grip on the reins, but don't pull too hard

21:26.540 --> 21:28.420
just pull the

21:28.420 --> 21:29.800
normal

21:29.800 --> 21:36.420
For camels for camels rain normal amount. They don't give a number how much torque do I need to use?

21:36.420 --> 21:43.380
It's so hard to not err on the side of pulling too hard because there's definitely a not too hard amount that I could hold

21:43.380 --> 21:45.380
It yeah, I'm gonna find myself

21:45.940 --> 21:47.940
negative

21:47.940 --> 21:53.820
Not only that if we're trying to earn this camels respect and I give it a loose like and it's like what was that?

21:53.820 --> 21:59.700
What was that was nothing? Yeah, you got to just be just got to be consistent

22:00.220 --> 22:03.480
Feel like I was thinking about if my camel ran away

22:03.480 --> 22:08.660
It would really there's a level of exotic

22:09.400 --> 22:11.400
This is that yeah

22:12.080 --> 22:13.520
Exoticity there it is

22:13.520 --> 22:18.520
There's a level of exoticity of an animal where owning that animal

22:19.160 --> 22:21.160
becomes your

22:21.240 --> 22:23.240
core define like

22:24.480 --> 22:26.480
Constrictor person or

22:26.680 --> 22:29.120
See I feel like even a boa constrictor is

22:29.120 --> 22:36.600
It's like right on the line of like if someone says you should meet my friend Dan. It would be the first thing

22:37.480 --> 22:39.540
Here's what you got to know about Dan

22:40.340 --> 22:45.880
He owns a camel. I mean I guess probably depending on your locale though because there would be parts where

22:46.680 --> 22:50.800
Yes, he doesn't own a camel and you bet there's a commiserate

22:51.480 --> 22:58.000
There's a there's a commiserate level of like there's a animal animal that is exotic

22:58.000 --> 23:02.400
Yeah in camel faring nations as it would be here

23:02.400 --> 23:09.080
Do you say camel faring or camel fearing? I heard fearing. I heard fearing also, which is like what nation is that?

23:09.080 --> 23:11.080
That's like

23:13.920 --> 23:16.800
Try to get the camel moving in a circle, all right

23:17.680 --> 23:19.920
You got it. You got a stunt that camel

23:19.920 --> 23:23.240
You've got to let the camel have a little bit of fun by stunting it in a cool circle

23:23.240 --> 23:26.000
How long do you think I don't know how smart camels are

23:26.000 --> 23:28.960
But it gets smart if my camera got away from me

23:28.960 --> 23:32.080
How far do you think it would get before it's like oh shit. I don't know where I'm going

23:32.080 --> 23:38.160
Yeah, I need to go back to Travis. I'm gonna die out here now now while you're stunting in the Sun

23:38.960 --> 23:42.880
Doing doing doughnuts on your camel this next step is pretty important

23:42.880 --> 23:46.280
Try to remain saddled until the camel stops if you get it to circle

23:46.320 --> 23:52.420
You must hang on and let it run and hang on for the fucking right of your life

23:52.420 --> 23:54.420
Why did I do this?

23:55.100 --> 24:01.700
No, not the ramp. You've got to get your center of gravity low and grip it with your legs and just

24:02.420 --> 24:06.500
fucking close your eyes pray to whatever God you believe in and

24:07.540 --> 24:13.200
Just just see what happens next. I can't imagine it's that hard though cuz you just put yourself between the two humps

24:13.200 --> 24:15.100
That's exactly what I was about to say Travis

24:15.100 --> 24:16.900
It's so funny you say that cuz I feel like

24:16.900 --> 24:22.420
Camel is them any sort of dromedary would be the most embarrassing to fall off because they have a human divot

24:22.420 --> 24:25.240
It's all right there part of the grand design. Yeah

24:26.320 --> 24:28.320
perfect perfect

24:29.500 --> 24:34.700
So remain saddled until the camel stops unless consider a quick dismount if all else fails

24:37.660 --> 24:44.660
Sorry, hey your camel just trampled like my family. Yes. Sorry. He was going too fast. Did you pull on it the normal amount?

24:44.660 --> 24:50.740
Yeah, I did. It's the regular not too much right? No. No, that was a trick. I'm just trying to get you with my trick

24:51.060 --> 24:54.500
Damn, that's weird camels are usually so calm. I know that's why I had to jump off

24:54.500 --> 24:58.460
I don't like the vagueness of if all else fails

24:59.460 --> 25:02.500
Because one of the steps was stay saddled

25:02.940 --> 25:07.980
Which then makes me think is that one of the things that would fail at which point someone would be like, hey

25:07.980 --> 25:10.700
I saw you fall off your camel and you go. No, no, no, no

25:10.700 --> 25:18.180
Yeah, I jumped off my camel because all else all everything else failed look real quick part to know what to do

25:18.180 --> 25:22.860
Once you've regained control, which is assuming a lot, but you've gotten the camel to chill

25:22.860 --> 25:27.680
You're off the camel and you're not dead one get the camel get off the camel

25:27.680 --> 25:31.240
Once you have it under control once the wild ride is over have the camels it

25:31.380 --> 25:34.900
Yeah steak you and your camels like you fucking bought it

25:34.900 --> 25:42.160
And he's out well Charles, that's why you need to do step to keep a safe distance from your camel because and this is a fun fact

25:42.700 --> 25:45.700
Unlike horses camels can kick in all directions

25:46.580 --> 25:48.580
omni-directional

25:48.740 --> 25:50.480
straight up

25:50.480 --> 25:53.660
Fucking awesome. It could kick straight up. They can kick God

25:54.340 --> 25:56.980
Cloud cloud kickers so cool

25:56.980 --> 26:04.660
One of the steps have a calm but like direct discussion with your camel about what the two of you

26:04.780 --> 26:10.200
Could do better next time don't make it all about the camel use a lot of I statements Travis

26:10.200 --> 26:12.200
You're getting way ahead of me. Fuck me

26:12.200 --> 26:12.660
Yeah

26:12.660 --> 26:18.740
Step three is don't run away from the camel because if you turn your back to the camel it may chase after you and kick you

26:18.980 --> 26:20.980
No matter which which away

26:21.420 --> 26:24.420
There's nowhere you can hide from the camel's mini kicks

26:24.420 --> 26:27.740
That's why I run away to the camel once it's calmed down

26:28.580 --> 26:35.760
Like oh the camels calm. It's not wilding out anymore. Bye. You know it's trying to fucking trick you and prank you

26:37.460 --> 26:41.500
Don't make any sharper sudden movements great great great and then step five and this is awesome

26:41.620 --> 26:47.900
Try walking in a slow circle around your camel while talking to it calmly. I wish someone would do that to me sometime

26:48.300 --> 26:51.820
I'm gonna ask my therapist next time. I'm like really going

26:51.820 --> 26:58.900
Going bonkers in there to just like do a do a lap while giving me some sort of like nice affirmations

26:59.540 --> 27:03.180
That would be that would be very soothing to me a little 360 degree

27:04.740 --> 27:06.740
Since around experience

27:07.660 --> 27:11.060
How about another question yeah, all right? We have time right we do

27:11.060 --> 27:14.060
I just I feel like this is the most helpful thing sometimes

27:14.060 --> 27:19.100
I like to end the episode on the most helpful thing and knowing that a camel can kick you no matter where you're at

27:19.100 --> 27:21.100
even if you're like at home

27:23.740 --> 27:30.100
No matter what yeah camels gonna find you I just want to say 360 noscope camel so I can move on with my fucking life

27:30.100 --> 27:32.100
All right, let's go

27:32.100 --> 27:38.420
360 nose all right well can't say I can't I said it just then I realized I already said it mm-hmm

27:39.060 --> 27:43.140
Let's see here my partner, and I have been in the process of buying a house over the past couple months

27:43.140 --> 27:50.820
Congratulations, that's a stressful process. No kidding and it hasn't been going too. Well. Oh we recently found out found one

27:50.820 --> 27:56.340
That seems perfect for us. It's in our budget. It's nice outside. It's close to both of our jobs the problem

27:56.340 --> 27:59.140
The name of the road it's on is a brown town

28:00.060 --> 28:05.580
Where is this place? Did they say the city? I guess maybe they would know I'm gonna fucking drill down on this

28:05.580 --> 28:07.580
Yeah, I know what are you gonna?

28:07.580 --> 28:12.900
Road no, it's on Brown the name of the road. It's on his brown town

28:12.900 --> 28:17.100
Should I buy this place if I do how can I get over the fact that I live on this street?

28:17.100 --> 28:18.420
This is some rotten realty

28:18.420 --> 28:21.980
Please discuss this while I do a little googling to see if I can find Brown

28:21.980 --> 28:24.640
But we all want to look for Brown town Justin well

28:24.640 --> 28:27.660
We can't some of us have to do podcast Travis so

28:29.300 --> 28:33.340
Just right no bud like right off the top of the the heap here

28:33.340 --> 28:39.780
There's a brown town, Wisconsin brown town, Virginia brown town which is in the Salisbury Township in Ohio

28:39.780 --> 28:44.860
And there's like brown towns all over. There's Chattanooga. There's Battleboro, North Carolina

28:44.860 --> 28:52.980
There's Atlanta, Georgia the brown town of Wisconsin has accredited Google Maps. No reviews. So here's one. It's called brown town. That's hilarious

28:54.580 --> 28:56.940
Okay, three stars here's okay

28:57.260 --> 29:02.500
There's a brown town road in Michigan in Pennsylvania in Virginia also in Virginia this so they're all

29:02.500 --> 29:05.660
Okay, we're not gonna doxx this person. There's a lot of brown town roads

29:05.660 --> 29:12.060
Here's the problem for me is that there's a part of me that if like one of my friends like if Justin if you were

29:12.060 --> 29:16.060
Like how do I get to my house, and I was like well you just head on down to brown town

29:16.180 --> 29:19.580
That's funny, but then someone goes yeah, I got a package here

29:19.580 --> 29:22.900
Where do I deliver it and then I have to say to that person with my human mouth?

29:22.900 --> 29:25.980
I need you to deliver it to brown town I

29:26.620 --> 29:31.380
That that in that circumstance. I'm going to be embarrassed to tell people where I live

29:31.380 --> 29:35.500
But there will be other moments where I'd be super proud that and I don't know if it balances out

29:36.100 --> 29:38.340
Yeah, I don't think it does I

29:39.420 --> 29:41.420
What have you just said dookieberg?

29:41.500 --> 29:46.400
Every time you say it to someone. I mean, it's not you will get in here to it

29:47.500 --> 29:50.540
You know what I mean like you'll get in here to it, but then

29:51.380 --> 29:57.340
Eventually like you're you're what you're gonna get tired of is every time you tell someone you're gonna have to stop your entire life

29:57.340 --> 30:04.300
For 15 minutes to unpack yes. No yes. I'm used to it. No it doesn't bother me. Yes. It's really called brown town

30:04.340 --> 30:06.340
No, it's just a regular road

30:07.020 --> 30:12.300
Nothing weird what if you regular stuff happens here? What if you started pronouncing it brone town?

30:13.180 --> 30:17.140
Hmm what about brony town brony town come on the option?

30:17.860 --> 30:24.500
Because I don't think brown tone works the same but brone town the housing market being what it is

30:24.500 --> 30:31.120
is if you find a house that you can afford that you like and that you can

30:31.340 --> 30:35.760
Get an offering on and win the house in the game that we call houses

30:36.580 --> 30:39.820
and if it's on a street called

First off public service announcement. The chacarroni is back Papa John. Thank you. Thank you

37:07.000 --> 37:10.760
Don't get your chacarroni. It's a it's a Jake

Monstrous pepperoni pizza $1 every purchase. It is goes to a charity. It makes me so mad. It's not macaroni

I forgot it was the pizza. Sorry. Go now. It's a chacarroni with cheese. So the chacarroni is back. Baba John's

37:25.680 --> 37:27.680
No, I want to tell you about

37:28.240 --> 37:35.160
It's just really hard. This is just hard. Take your time. Okay guys Flavortown kitchen, huh?

37:35.160 --> 37:37.520
the partners with lifestyle

37:38.120 --> 37:39.520
brand

37:39.520 --> 37:46.440
middle-class fancy to debut the Rand burger, okay, this is that I I

37:47.160 --> 37:54.300
Sadly understand this and it is a fucking wild wild ride. So we're kind of in like, yes. Yes

37:56.240 --> 38:03.520
For sure, yeah, cuz it's like I read it and I I read it several times and my brain couldn't

38:03.520 --> 38:10.080
Put the chunks together. Yeah much the same way as guy. I have no idea what this is. Okay, okay

38:10.180 --> 38:15.940
Can I take a stab? Yeah, take a stab. It's like it's like an Instagram joke account

38:16.860 --> 38:23.940
That like makes fun of Guy Fieri sometimes and but now Guy Fieri is like no, let's collab win collab win now

38:24.620 --> 38:31.080
Am I close? You're basically got it middle-class fancy is like an Instagram account. You know what I mean?

38:31.080 --> 38:34.800
Where it doesn't mean jokes. Yeah, okay and memes

38:36.480 --> 38:38.480
Are like jokes

38:39.560 --> 38:46.760
That's unique remove punchlines and substituted with images. You're familiar with. Yeah, if you need it, that's a meme, right?

38:46.840 --> 38:51.020
So there's all your vocab that you need here the world's most memeable chef

38:51.220 --> 38:54.920
Guy Fieri is taking his Flavortown kitchen a

38:54.920 --> 39:02.640
Delivery only restaurant brand powered by virtual dining concepts to heights. What a what a food stew our

39:03.280 --> 39:08.080
Words do to new heights by partnering with the most iconic name in suburban meme culture

39:08.600 --> 39:12.760
Middle-class fancy the partnership not only brings together two brands synonymous with memes

39:13.080 --> 39:19.360
But also offers a new menu item the random burger now available for a limited time only

39:19.360 --> 39:26.320
Okay, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen. I know that in this day and age. This is like a really like trite

39:26.720 --> 39:28.720
observation to make but imagine

39:29.760 --> 39:35.280
taking this press release back in time even just like 30 years and

39:35.800 --> 39:41.880
Handing this to a human being and they would read it and be like what if this is this is what is this?

39:41.880 --> 39:47.840
Did you cut up a bunch of words in a magazine and throw them into the air and this is how they land like none

39:47.840 --> 39:55.000
Of this makes sense. I get it for the fact. No, I know listen you get it because you understand

39:55.320 --> 39:57.320
Individually what all these words beam

39:57.640 --> 40:01.960
But without any context whatsoever, you could not put this together

40:02.720 --> 40:07.040
Like sans context clues this these words mean nothing on their own

40:08.120 --> 40:09.720
so

40:09.720 --> 40:16.240
Middle some middle-class fancy is a meme account from Instagram and does seem to credit people for their memes sometimes

40:16.240 --> 40:21.480
I can't really give a definitive answer on that but they do dunk on Guy Fieri and Guy Fieri

40:21.480 --> 40:24.400
I guess loved the dunking so much that he wanted a collab

40:24.800 --> 40:32.040
Millions of followers view middle-class fancies unique perspective on the absurdities of suburban lifestyle from jokes about air fryers to grilling battles

40:32.440 --> 40:39.440
Integrating Guy Fieri's Flavortown kitchen into the middle-class fancy universe led Fieri to naming a burger after their beloved character Rand

40:39.440 --> 40:46.000
Like I in Rand, so this is yeah, so this is like the first burger that is also an inside

40:46.880 --> 40:48.880
Joke, you know what I mean? I

40:50.080 --> 40:56.760
Started middle-class fancy as an exaggerated version of the life. I grew up around coming from a small town in Cedar Town, Georgia

40:57.200 --> 41:01.680
It's a small town in Cedar Town, Georgia. That must be a pretty fucking small town

41:02.080 --> 41:05.040
It's like safety town. It's like safety town

41:05.040 --> 41:09.840
I already had a different meme account where I put I don't care about someone who is

41:10.240 --> 41:16.240
More successful than me because they post memes. I need this. That's a shame. There's a lot of people you've just described

41:16.240 --> 41:22.920
I know I rolled out a lot of people, huh? Sorry, I prefer books by author wait, so people make money from posting

41:24.880 --> 41:26.880
Huge part of middle-class fancy universe

41:27.400 --> 41:32.040
Involves the restaurant experience as well. I'm beyond excited to work with guy and I know my audience

41:32.040 --> 41:36.840
What we love what we have in store for them. It's I mean, it's a burger

41:37.920 --> 41:44.080
Here's here's the here's a quote from Guy Fieri and I know this one isn't funny. I'm really struggling with it

41:44.080 --> 41:47.160
I'm being honest about that and that's worth something. It's vulnerable

41:48.080 --> 41:50.960
Meme or no. Let me do my Guy Fieri voice

41:51.640 --> 41:58.000
Meme or no meme Rand is a real dude and a formidable grill master says Guy Fieri

41:58.000 --> 42:02.720
So in recognition of his true backyard burger badassery

42:02.720 --> 42:07.280
I'm allowing Rand a limited time only trip through flavor town

42:09.840 --> 42:12.640
That your Guy Fieri Justin

42:13.200 --> 42:14.240
Yeah

42:14.240 --> 42:21.520
Scares the shit out of me. What's wrong with him? We can we have time we can sort of zero in do them again

42:22.160 --> 42:24.160
Just say that again

42:24.160 --> 42:31.360
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's it's a it's a he wants to fight me yeah, yeah

42:31.360 --> 42:34.680
Yeah, yeah, are the very least challenge my preconceptions

42:35.000 --> 42:41.960
Do you not do you not get the impression that Guy Fieri wants to fight food a lot? Oh fight food. Yeah, that's interesting

42:41.960 --> 42:48.580
I don't want to take this ham Sammy out back and kick its balls. Yeah, that's cool that I get

42:48.580 --> 42:56.260
That I get if he said I named this burger after I mean the burgers name

42:56.260 --> 43:02.940
That's a character on an Instagram meme feed. Yeah, what is happening? Well, it's 2021 and nothing means anything anymore

43:03.420 --> 43:07.380
No, this means something and this means something to me. Does it? Yeah

43:08.260 --> 43:14.620
What's it mean to you Griffin? That's funny when one funny thing does a funny thing with another funny thing?

43:14.620 --> 43:20.060
That's good shit, man. Well, I mean you can get it if you want it you guys know

43:20.060 --> 43:27.420
But you don't even need a restaurant to have a restaurant anymore Guy Fieri that you get the idea like Flavortown kitchen

43:27.420 --> 43:29.820
This is not a rest. This is not a building you can go to

43:30.500 --> 43:35.580
You just tell Uber Eats you want it and Guy Fieri ships it to you or something

43:36.100 --> 43:43.380
Some like is there a hook my favorite burger in Huntington? Yeah is the mr. Beast burger, which is delivered

43:43.380 --> 43:50.020
Via a YouTube account called mr. Beast and he started a bunch of burger places hundreds

43:50.660 --> 43:52.460
throughout the u.s

43:52.460 --> 43:55.440
It's you that's the best burger in town. It seems from this YouTube guy

43:55.440 --> 43:57.060
I see the one who gives people

43:57.060 --> 44:03.900
Bunches of money and you watch mr. Beast and you think like damn this little dude's like a little publishers clearinghouse. Look at this

44:05.180 --> 44:06.060
gentleman

44:06.060 --> 44:08.060
Yeah, he goes place to place

44:08.060 --> 44:13.300
Sometimes he gets hunted by the FBI and if the FBI catches him he gives him 10 10,000

44:14.620 --> 44:16.620
100 G's

44:18.420 --> 44:23.480
Well, it's not the whole FBI it's just one guy so and I have to imagine he's like a disgrace

44:25.100 --> 44:28.060
Cuz I can't imagine they let their best people do this

44:29.180 --> 44:34.940
But maybe I don't know. All right, that's that's it. It's like I this is why I'm saying and this is why I'm struggling with

44:34.940 --> 44:36.940
it like I

44:36.940 --> 44:42.260
You don't know if it's normal or not. It's not that I know if it's normal. It's like I feel like

44:43.380 --> 44:46.500
the we have crossed some sort of

44:47.740 --> 44:50.740
You to the fighting lot what a tuba con

44:51.260 --> 44:56.580
That's could be it. It's like it. It's like a dividing line where no, it's like more of like a

44:57.160 --> 45:04.020
We've broken the memetic seal. So you the thing the fact that it is wild is

45:04.020 --> 45:08.100
Is the point the cruelty is the point, you know?

45:08.100 --> 45:13.900
Yeah, it is why yes, that's right. It is wild and that's why a lot of these products. They're not even like

45:14.740 --> 45:19.600
For sale in a wide-reaching way. It's just like yeah, we did a really stupid thing

45:19.700 --> 45:24.440
Well, you care about it and that pushes you into a well and forces you to tweet about it

45:24.440 --> 45:26.740
This is the thing we have reached a point now

45:26.740 --> 45:31.940
We're like the pendulum is gonna swing back the other way and pretty soon like a big news story

45:31.940 --> 45:35.380
It's gonna be like McDonald's saying like yeah, we're making a new burger and that's it

45:35.380 --> 45:38.940
It's just a new burger and it has ingredients that we thought you would like

45:39.540 --> 45:46.300
The only human part of the fast the casual dining industry anymore. The only human part is that there's

45:46.980 --> 45:48.980
Everybody's doing a lot more

45:49.260 --> 45:56.380
Plants you can eat a lot this which seems good in my stupid opinion, you know, it seems good. Yeah plants

45:56.380 --> 46:01.580
All right, that was that was a challenging one

46:01.860 --> 46:06.540
It's a challenging one right because I don't know. I don't know. Is that worth reporting?

46:06.540 --> 46:12.300
Is that a new story for much squat? I don't know because that it's the point the that is the point, you know

46:12.300 --> 46:19.540
It's not an exception anymore. It is the rule that exactly. Yeah, Trav. I mean, yeah, it doesn't require a

46:19.900 --> 46:21.900
Me to do it. Like yeah

46:22.460 --> 46:25.540
Guy did his own munch squad kind of you know what I mean?

46:25.540 --> 46:28.220
It's like I I'll take this from you too

46:28.220 --> 46:33.140
I'll tell you what would be an exciting one squad is if you could find a press release that was like this meme account

46:33.340 --> 46:37.940
Tried to get Guy Fieri to do a burger with him and Guy Fieri said no

46:38.380 --> 46:42.900
I'm not gonna do that. That sounds too silly. I wish I could get I mean

46:42.900 --> 46:44.900
I've been truck we've been trying to get guy on the show for

46:45.420 --> 46:47.260
You got a partner with him

46:47.260 --> 46:52.340
Got a partner with him. Maybe that's it. Maybe if we had a great character, he could do a burger my burger my burger me

46:52.340 --> 46:58.420
All right burgers. Okay. Now you are now you are actually cooking with gas two burgers and yourself

47:00.380 --> 47:03.420
That's it it sounded like I would get three burgers

47:07.780 --> 47:12.220
Me it's my burger my burger me and you have to eat both of them while guy watches

47:12.220 --> 47:14.380
I got an idea for a new hot dog. Oh

47:15.300 --> 47:18.580
Yeah called stink dogs. Get at me guy, but I'm not gonna tell you what it is

47:18.580 --> 47:25.020
Oh, unless you make the connection I have a new idea for a hot dog called a not dog

47:25.220 --> 47:27.380
And I'm just gonna tell you what it is. It's an empty bun

47:27.940 --> 47:32.660
All right. Do you get it? That's good. You can put whatever you want in there

47:32.660 --> 47:38.980
It's your it's your blue sky, but not a hot dog. No speaking speaking, which I want to tell you guys

47:42.020 --> 47:46.660
Yeah, thanks, right and I got hot dogs for dinner and there was an extra hot dog

47:46.660 --> 47:50.340
I think you know, we hit we had the whole nine yards buns the whole thing

47:50.900 --> 47:56.340
We ended up I was cleaning up at the end of the night, right? Yeah, and I I

47:57.060 --> 47:59.760
There's a bag of bun. Yeah, and I went to go store it

48:01.220 --> 48:03.220
My wife, uh-huh

48:03.500 --> 48:05.500
my wife had

48:06.300 --> 48:09.940
Put the one leftover hot dog we had. Yeah

48:09.940 --> 48:16.340
Into the one remaining bun that we have and then wrapped it back up in the hot dog bun bag

48:16.340 --> 48:21.460
Cool. And left it on the counter. I like that. Have you ever heard anything more treacherous in your entire life?

48:21.460 --> 48:25.620
I mean, okay if you're at an outdoor picnic and you have to protect it from the elements

48:25.620 --> 48:30.580
But I'm imagining you don't got buzz buzz flies in your kitchen. Where does that fit into the

48:32.660 --> 48:34.660
Like

48:34.660 --> 48:41.940
Procedures of food handling we're like now you have this and I didn't know about it. That's just really important

48:41.940 --> 48:48.020
Yeah, to me. It's a bun in a bag. There's one bun in the bag left time to store this with buns

48:48.340 --> 48:53.820
That is I think that is the the cat because they've if if it was my wife

48:54.940 --> 48:56.940
my wife, thank you and

48:56.940 --> 49:04.140
She put the hot dog in the bun and then loudly announced I'm gonna wrap this up that

49:04.660 --> 49:09.860
Right fine. Let me know but you gotta let you gotta let Justin know you gotta let Justin know

49:10.340 --> 49:14.180
It's the on the counter that also bothers me because I feel the people of this world

49:14.900 --> 49:21.420
On on the whole have way too. They're too blase about the old danger zone of

49:22.020 --> 49:26.660
Yeah, and 40 to 140 folks. It's more than four hours

49:26.660 --> 49:30.140
You got a chuck it you just broke it through the danger zone sometimes

49:30.820 --> 49:37.900
Sometimes even then I feel personally is pushing it where if I've been at a party and it's been like two hours

49:37.900 --> 49:41.340
I'm like, oh we could just oh, you know, nobody's picking at this anymore

49:41.340 --> 49:46.740
Oh if we could just go ahead and put this back in the old refrigerator. Oh

49:48.420 --> 49:53.020
Travis you've actually tied in beautifully to our next question. All right. I have a simple query today

49:53.060 --> 49:56.380
What's the appropriate time to delete someone's contact information?

49:56.380 --> 50:00.180
I have some people from high school in my phone and old work contacts

50:00.260 --> 50:06.820
How long without being in touch is it good enough to simply purge my phone of their existence? That's from living on the lam. I

50:07.340 --> 50:09.340
have

50:09.580 --> 50:11.580
Roughly

50:12.820 --> 50:18.380
1500 people. Oh, no, I'm sorry. I have an exact number. Okay, it's only 900 contacts in my contacts

50:18.380 --> 50:22.420
Wow, because at some point iCloud was like hey you want every single person

50:22.420 --> 50:27.700
You've ever received an email from to be added to your contacts, right? And sometimes you click through those contacts

50:27.700 --> 50:30.220
It's like oh, we didn't think you'd actually click on it. We don't know

50:31.940 --> 50:35.460
Yeah, we can't get a hold of these persons off the greatest parts were concerned

50:36.340 --> 50:38.340
Yeah, I have PR or

50:39.140 --> 50:41.140
HR from AOL

50:41.380 --> 50:48.180
So if I need to reach out to AOL HR to get something taken care of I can just knock that knock that right out

50:48.180 --> 50:54.780
I this weird thing happened at some point between Teresa and I like sharing computers and

50:55.100 --> 50:58.340
Backups of phones and being on like the same AT&T account

50:59.260 --> 51:07.300
Somehow our phones have now melded and all of her contacts are mixed with my contacts in my phone and all of my contacts

51:07.300 --> 51:09.300
are mixed with her contacts and her phone and

51:09.340 --> 51:14.500
So is created this thing where I'll be searching for a number a name will come up and I'm like who the fuck I?

51:14.500 --> 51:17.700
I don't know this Eric person and Trace is like, oh

51:17.700 --> 51:22.100
That's a guy I went to high school with and I'll look at it and think I should delete that

51:22.700 --> 51:28.260
Then I won't because what if I need to contact air? I I have a I have a

51:29.060 --> 51:34.260
Okay, there's an impulse to leave every contact on there. I get that at the same time though

51:35.480 --> 51:41.220
Every day you do that is another day. You run the risk of accidentally pressing the dial, but we've all done

51:41.220 --> 51:43.220
Yep, actually pressing the dial button

51:43.220 --> 51:44.460
I

51:44.460 --> 51:48.300
Think you delete it when you if you were to call that person would have

51:49.180 --> 51:55.860
Absolutely, no possible. There are some people that are so removed from me in terms of

51:56.900 --> 52:03.100
Be it like actual geographic space or time or life events. Yes, right

52:03.100 --> 52:05.580
Yeah, where a call to them would be

52:06.420 --> 52:08.140
utterly

52:08.140 --> 52:13.460
Here's my phone would instantly become a burner. I'd have to put it into a hydraulic press but this is

52:13.460 --> 52:16.300
This is the problem to go back to like the age

52:16.300 --> 52:20.780
We live in right as the issue is that like and maybe this is a very specific problem

52:20.780 --> 52:24.500
But I don't think so because more and more people are turning to internet content creation for a job

52:24.500 --> 52:29.040
Is that you run the risk of a kid you go up went to high school with right who has your same phone number?

52:29.580 --> 52:30.700
like

52:30.700 --> 52:37.140
You know following your Instagram account where you post your art or listening your podcast or whatever and texting you like I love the show

52:37.140 --> 52:39.780
And you've deleted it. It's just a random number and you're like

52:40.740 --> 52:46.460
Fucking nightmare. Yeah, and they're like no no no we like we're best friends for eight years I

52:47.100 --> 52:52.400
Have rust frushtick in my contact. You can delete four four separate times

52:53.500 --> 52:56.060
What do I need? Why does he have four cell phone?

52:56.060 --> 52:59.280
I have dad in my phone twice and I went to numbers

52:59.280 --> 53:01.980
And I have to remember every time like which was my real dad

53:01.980 --> 53:08.340
I have Richard Garriott in my phone for some I can text Richard Garriott right now and be like let me get all up in

53:08.340 --> 53:11.960
Heaven do take me to space take me your wonderful castle rich

53:13.460 --> 53:18.140
I'm trying to think of like what's the weird what's one I could get rid of let's see is that cuz

53:18.660 --> 53:21.860
Well, it's just sometimes. I have numbers saved to my phone for like businesses

53:22.100 --> 53:25.540
Yeah, I don't go to like I don't know where it's just like well

53:25.540 --> 53:30.420
I checked this enough times that like it's just I'm just gonna save it and then it's like well

53:30.420 --> 53:34.740
How often am I calling you know the Huntington Museum of Art?

53:34.740 --> 53:38.700
You know I could probably get rid of that one we can do another question, okay?

53:41.660 --> 53:44.100
There's a good one this this was a good one

53:45.420 --> 53:49.140
The local university has obtained a rare corpse flower

53:49.140 --> 53:55.340
And I want to sounds like the beginning of a murder mystery go on and I want to go see it because it's a once-in-lifetime

53:55.340 --> 54:00.180
Opportunity, but my girlfriend doesn't want to go with me because it will smell bad like a corpse

54:00.460 --> 54:06.700
How do I convince her to come experience this nasty blooming flower with me? That's from noxious in Knoxville

54:06.700 --> 54:12.340
Oh, is that it's weird to think that there are people in this world that when you're like smell how bad this smells

54:12.340 --> 54:14.260
They're not like okay

54:14.260 --> 54:18.500
Right like yeah, that's me. I was like oh my god. It smells terrible

54:18.500 --> 54:26.420
Does it like it's that's see it like I've been at a funeral homes where they had smelling salts, and it's all I wanted

54:26.420 --> 54:32.060
Oh, I've hit the smelling salts. Oh, yeah, it does not feel good. It's no you got it

54:32.060 --> 54:36.820
But you got to do it like you got to know what this thing you got to know what that stink is like I?

54:37.800 --> 54:41.700
Don't like the smell of flowers, so this wouldn't really stress me out that much

54:42.300 --> 54:44.340
Smell flowers grosses me out. Why?

54:44.340 --> 54:48.540
Because that makes me because the art because I have at some point

54:49.540 --> 54:51.540
some part of my brain

54:52.020 --> 54:55.140
Connected funerals and flowers, and that's where I'm at now

54:55.940 --> 55:00.700
Get out of it. That's where I'm at. That's what my brain if I have fresh good people give me flowers

55:00.700 --> 55:05.340
I want to cry. I hate I can't stand smell flower really don't like them. I don't like them

55:05.460 --> 55:09.920
I'll try this court flower. I guess, but maybe I could just rule the whole category now, but

55:11.020 --> 55:12.300
flower

55:12.300 --> 55:14.960
Maybe that would be what purges your system

55:15.580 --> 55:18.580
Maybe I don't think I I don't think so

55:19.380 --> 55:26.620
You know some if somebody doesn't want to go do something stinky. I think you gotta respect it. You know you're that's a very legitimate

55:26.780 --> 55:30.020
We've gotten to where we're at as a species

55:30.900 --> 55:32.020
by

55:32.020 --> 55:37.020
Respecting the desire to not smell stinky thing yeah a lot of times

55:37.020 --> 55:42.300
That's earth trying to tell you this poison. I would also say that there is a good distance

55:42.480 --> 55:47.820
Along the way of this journey that your girlfriend could accompany you right up to but not including

55:48.180 --> 55:52.100
Smelling the bad bad stinky flower that would make it a day together

55:52.940 --> 55:54.120
Right a yeah

55:54.120 --> 55:59.120
You don't need to share this experience if they don't if if someone said hey Travis

55:59.120 --> 56:04.620
There's a flower down at local university that smells like stinky old garbage juice

56:04.620 --> 56:09.860
That's been left out in the Sun come with it with me. I'd be like no no no and they'd be like oh

56:09.860 --> 56:14.660
I thought we were friends. Let me augment that though. Just a little bit Travis. There's an

56:15.460 --> 56:17.180
incredibly rare

56:17.180 --> 56:23.460
Flower that smells like stinky garbage juice that you will never get the chance again to smell down to university come down

56:23.460 --> 56:29.220
That's you know I do that. I know that's what I'm saying like I want to eat durian fruit

56:29.220 --> 56:35.700
And like that's the one thing that like that dude from bizarre foods is like this fucking gross. I hate this shit

56:35.700 --> 56:39.100
I'm like I want to eat that nasty ass fruit. Yeah

56:39.860 --> 56:44.580
If Andrew Zimmern hates it. I'll fucking chomp it. I want to be braver than him

56:44.580 --> 56:50.900
I want to know that I'm the braver man a ship in harbor is safe. Go smell the fucking flower is awesome

56:51.100 --> 56:54.860
This person already wants to smell the flower they need to convince someone else to smell the flower

56:54.860 --> 57:00.780
Hey, go smell the flower and be like it's kicked ass you got I'm gonna have to disagree with this one

57:01.100 --> 57:01.780
All right

57:01.780 --> 57:07.160
because here's the thing if they there is a chance now that that person goes up and smell it and

57:07.460 --> 57:13.180
After like question asker has like go to them on and cajole them to do it and then they smell like yeah

57:13.180 --> 57:19.280
Oh fucking awful, and I hate that that happened right and now it's that thing and then the next time you're like hey

57:19.280 --> 57:23.100
Go do this thing with me. I'm going to this weird Renaissance Festival

57:23.100 --> 57:27.540
And they're like I don't know that I want to go to that you've lost all bargaining power

57:27.940 --> 57:32.380
No, because if you say come smell this stinky ass rotten corpse flower with me

57:32.380 --> 57:37.180
And then you go and they're like that smelled so bad, and you can say like yeah, I

57:38.020 --> 57:40.460
Did say that it's not like you're going to saying like hey?

57:40.460 --> 57:44.380
we're gonna go to the Renaissance Fair and get overcharged for dry turkey and

57:45.100 --> 57:49.140
And we're gonna feel not confident in our costumes, and they'll be like well

57:49.140 --> 57:54.700
That's a you were also not selling this very well. I don't know go smell the flower man shipping Harbor

57:54.700 --> 57:57.580
I don't think you should make people smell things. They don't want to smell

57:58.180 --> 58:02.180
Okay, shipping her well, but you could have a trade-off and say like you smell this flower

58:02.180 --> 58:04.180
And then I'll smell something you want me to smell

58:04.780 --> 58:09.660
It would be kind of fun to be at a place where you could just loudly say pee you that is true

58:10.180 --> 58:12.180
You know the main thing

58:12.180 --> 58:18.660
Pee yeah, and people would be like that's exactly the reaction. We're going for thank you so much while

58:19.580 --> 58:21.980
You're waiting in line to smell it

58:22.580 --> 58:27.980
Just be like pee you and people like you can already we're outside the building

58:27.980 --> 58:34.220
And you're like yeah, it smells so you guys can't smell that ooh stinky Pee you this is I actually I have a similar feel

58:34.220 --> 58:39.700

58:39.700 --> 58:42.980

59:21.860 --> 59:28.020
Conservatory, and he accidentally eats three butterflies and a volcano erupts and he turns into butterfly man

59:28.020 --> 59:31.800
