00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:52.320
Live from Coachella, it's Hologram. My brother, my brother, and me, we're made of light 2012.

00:52.320 --> 00:56.960
That's the name of the tour, but also we are holograms. Hello everyone, beep boop bop boop.

00:56.960 --> 01:02.560
Beep. I've secretly been a hologram this entire time. You are made of light,

01:04.720 --> 01:12.080
and as a result, you know Tupac. Yeah, me and Tupac hang out. We were both made of light and ghost

01:12.080 --> 01:18.000
magic, and we both performed at the Coachella stage, but you couldn't see me very well because

01:18.640 --> 01:23.360
my light wasn't turned on very bright. Oh, that sucks. If you look really closely at the videos,

01:23.360 --> 01:32.480
you can see me in the back, and I am just viciously sea walking. The problem that hologram Tupac ran

01:32.480 --> 01:41.120
into is he was out of time reversal cubes. That is a joke about the- That is a time traveler goof

01:41.120 --> 01:48.160
that like- Literally two people, and they're both on this show with you. But it's a hologram game,

01:48.160 --> 01:53.760
you see. Yeah. Yeah, I got that. My boy Rick Dyer, creator of Time Traveler the Hologram Game.

01:54.320 --> 02:00.880
Maybe let's try new goofs. Am I the only person that when I hear Coachella, I always just assume

02:00.880 --> 02:05.280
it's an Italian liquor? You are the only person that sees that. I'm the only person that does

02:05.280 --> 02:09.200
that? I think most of us are like in the loop on Coachella, right? I don't know what Coachella is.

02:09.760 --> 02:16.240
I did not know this until a couple days ago, my roommate pointed it out. So Coachella, right,

02:16.240 --> 02:22.160
they had the weekend lineup, which for two weekends ago, and then they brought that same

02:22.160 --> 02:29.360
exact lineup back, the same exact schedule for this past weekend. What? They did two weekends

02:29.360 --> 02:36.800
of identical Coachellas. Why? I guess it's so big that they can't fit it all in one Coachella.

02:36.800 --> 02:40.400
But do you think that like, imagine being a musical act, it's like, all right, let's do this

02:40.400 --> 02:45.280
whole same thing again. And also imagine like you're high on Coke weed, and you're like, what's

02:45.280 --> 02:53.280
happening? Is Tupac back again? Yeah. Saw this already on YouTube. Thanks, though. I want you

02:53.280 --> 02:58.160
guys to know that before I knew that there was a hologram angle to the story, and I just read

02:58.160 --> 03:04.480
like the article headline, Tupac performs at Coachella. Yeah, I lost my mind. Sure. I was like,

03:04.480 --> 03:09.440
I knew it. I've known all along. I knew it. Second performance. Check this out. Second

03:09.440 --> 03:16.720
performance. Hologram Tupac. Everyone's like, Yonzo. And then who's that? Hologram B.I.G.

03:17.520 --> 03:22.960
What are they doing? Laser tag. They're shooting hologram lasers from their fingers

03:23.520 --> 03:29.600
and fighting each other. They hologram, but hologram Tupac gets shot. He gets derezzed,

03:29.600 --> 03:32.960
right? And then what happens? Yeah, he gets shot by hologram Biggie.

03:32.960 --> 03:42.160
15 years from now. What's up? Hologram of Tupac's hologram. Hologram hologram Tupac.

03:42.880 --> 03:52.000
Machiavelli rise again. 9-11 was a hoax. That was a Tupac thing, right? He was in the spare change.

03:52.880 --> 03:58.000
Why do you have to? Was that a Tupac thing? I can't. I don't recall if that was a Tupac. How

03:58.000 --> 04:03.760
could that possibly be related to Tupac? I feel like he was he was 9-11 his numbers and so is two

04:03.760 --> 04:11.200
and two is in Tupac. Tupac. I do. I do enjoy his music. I do not enjoy his holograms. This is

04:11.920 --> 04:15.520
my brother, my brother, me and advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother,

04:15.520 --> 04:20.400
Justin McElroy. I'm your middle brother, hologram Travis McElroy. I'm your baby brother,

04:20.400 --> 04:28.720
holo Biggie. I'm also Griffin McElroy. And I'm Jim. It's a shame that Jim didn't come out because

04:28.720 --> 04:34.720
it seems like once you have Tupac, hologram Tupac, that you're missing opportunity if you

04:34.720 --> 04:39.360
don't have Jim and the holograms also performing. You could have hologram Jim Belushi out there

04:39.360 --> 04:43.760
all day long and no one would watch him. Wouldn't that be a fart in the face if you were still

04:43.760 --> 04:48.800
alive and instead they went with the hologram thing and they're like, no, we don't need the

04:48.800 --> 04:53.360
real person. We'll just do a hologram Travis. Also, wouldn't that be crazy if people went to

04:53.360 --> 04:59.760
see Jim Belushi on a stage, hologram or no. In any context basically. Are you going to see the

04:59.760 --> 05:06.720
Belushi tonight? Sold out Madison Square Garden in this bathroom. The bathroom, the first floor

05:06.720 --> 05:12.640
bathroom, men's bathroom, Madison MSG. He's playing there. It's a 10 seater. With himself.

05:12.640 --> 05:21.040
I miss Jim Belushi. I wish I wished. What's he doing now? Is he still according to Jim?

05:22.480 --> 05:29.120
He's programming the Tupac hologram. This is my greatest creation. I thought it was the pilot

05:29.120 --> 05:34.960
script which I had a consulting credit on of according to Jim, but no. No, it's this. It's

05:34.960 --> 05:42.560
hologram Tupac. If I die, if I ever do die. That is not my plan, but if God ever finally gets the

05:42.560 --> 05:48.240
better of me. Will you guys promise to never make a hologram of me? I can't do that. It just seems

05:48.240 --> 05:54.480
don't because they were making him say stuff. He never said. He said like, what's up Coachella?

05:54.480 --> 06:00.000
Which wasn't invented until like three years after I died. I love PBR. Yeah. How you doing?

06:00.000 --> 06:06.560
Wait, so wait, I did not. I did not see this video. Is it? Was it sort of like a was it like

06:06.560 --> 06:12.400
a Pirates of the Caribbean vibe where it was like hologram animatronic Tupac? Is that is that the

06:12.400 --> 06:17.280
score? No, he was just doing lines from Pirates of the Caribbean. Why would it need to be two?

06:18.000 --> 06:23.040
Why would you need to be hologram and a puppet? Because they're making him say stuff you said.

06:23.760 --> 06:27.920
He was saying stuff he never said, which the magic for that. I do not know how that I guess.

06:27.920 --> 06:32.160
Maybe they got maybe DMX. He kind of sounds like Tupac. He's got that gravelly voice.

06:33.200 --> 06:37.520
That's right. That's right. No, he's got a gravelly Tupac like voice. Maybe they brought him up

06:37.520 --> 06:42.480
because he's not doing much of anything nowadays. Right. He's not really the hit maker that he used

06:42.480 --> 06:50.000
to be. But don't make me don't bring me back to life in a hollow form and then make me say shit

06:50.000 --> 06:54.640
that I wouldn't have said IRL. What if what if we can promise to stay really true to the

06:54.640 --> 06:58.320
Griffin McElroy character? Mm hmm. That would be great. Just talk about like,

06:58.960 --> 07:05.440
yo, can't wait to go to Walgreens and get some on sale Easter candy. That is totally,

07:05.440 --> 07:10.640
I wish I wish Disney would release bug juice on DVD. Now we're just reading my tweets.

07:12.160 --> 07:19.280
So as you've probably guessed, this is an advice show for the modern era. As as as important as

07:19.280 --> 07:25.600
hologram Tupac is, maybe we should get to the advice. Hey, brothers, just so you know,

07:25.600 --> 07:30.480
I took your advice and moved in with my wife and we're engaged. We got married on February 29th.

07:30.480 --> 07:35.840
Yes, leap year. No, she does not poop in the shower. And finally, I have a question about

07:35.840 --> 07:41.760
our anniversary. Should I do something small every year on February 28th and do something

07:41.760 --> 07:48.000
a bit bigger every leap year? Or should I wait till leap year and do something freaking huge

07:48.000 --> 07:55.360
four years worth combined to one? That's from leaping into it. Jesus. Yikes. You got you can't

07:55.360 --> 08:00.160
save it up like that. Like the expectation every four years, you would have to, like,

08:00.160 --> 08:06.320
turn your body into like stars and then shoot into the heavens on a psychedelic trip into space.

08:06.320 --> 08:12.320
I like that. I have some bad news. So far, you're not good at marrying marriage. You messed up

08:12.320 --> 08:17.680
basically the first thing. Yeah, that you can't don't get married on imaginary days. Yeah,

08:17.680 --> 08:23.680
they when do you have your anniversary? It's crazy. I'm sure it seemed not. I did not need

08:23.680 --> 08:28.720
it. Did it sneak up on you? Were you like, we'll just do it this Sunday. And it turned out to be

08:28.720 --> 08:35.120
February 29th. Like, were you that casual about it? Maybe he was trying to make a goof. He's trying

08:35.120 --> 08:41.600
to, you know, sneak his way out of it. He says, Yeah, we can get married on February 29th. If

08:41.600 --> 08:49.840
such a day were to even exist on December 32nd, she caught you. She caught you. You got to just

08:49.840 --> 08:57.360
do something February. Effectively, your your anniversary is February 29th. But you can,

08:57.360 --> 09:04.800
you should absolutely observe it February 28th. Now here's a good thing. February 29th should is

09:04.800 --> 09:10.880
technically also, I mean, it's more accurately March 1st. So if you forget on February 28th,

09:10.880 --> 09:17.680
you got like a built in cushion. Well, I like to observe it on March 1st. That'll work. That'll work

09:17.680 --> 09:27.440
once. I I feel like my anniversary is one of the things that I'm it's one of those like as you get

09:27.440 --> 09:32.000
older, I think the novelty of birthdays and it kind of wears off because it's like, oops, gonna

09:32.000 --> 09:37.200
die. But I think with my anniversary, that's one of the few that I actually feel pretty proud of

09:37.200 --> 09:44.640
because it's like, Hey, world, nice try this world of a fragile marriages and Kardashians. I'm still

09:44.640 --> 09:49.360
I'm still saying that we did we did it again. Sorry, world. But and here's the other thing

09:49.360 --> 09:56.000
leaping into it not to tear you down. But it's also one of the few you actually get to pick

09:56.000 --> 10:02.240
the day of. You don't get to pick your birthday. Don't get to pick Christmas. You can schedule

10:02.240 --> 10:07.680
your anniversary ahead of time. Well, no, you can't. But yeah, you can say I think our anniversary

10:07.680 --> 10:13.520
should be in June. Let's get married in June. That's not how that works. I think it is. I'm

10:13.520 --> 10:19.920
almost certain when you get married. Justin, when you and Sydney decided on July 1st when you

10:19.920 --> 10:25.920
dedicated your lives to each other, that beautiful, beautiful Friday afternoon. I think is a Saturday.

10:25.920 --> 10:32.720
Did you think like, oh, man, this is gonna be a totally killer day for for all all future years

10:32.720 --> 10:38.800
to come? No, I thought this will be easy to remember. It is because I can do it. And I'm

10:38.800 --> 10:44.080
yeah, I am not involved in the arrangement at all. Not in the slightest. It's actually the very first

10:44.080 --> 10:49.200
day of the second half of the year. So yeah, you take it off with a bang. Take it off the second

10:49.200 --> 10:56.800
kick it off three Q3 this fiscal quarter of marriage. We're rocking into it with in a big way

10:56.800 --> 11:04.240
year over year. We are looking at huge dividends by which I mean, I guess like sex stuff. I just

11:04.240 --> 11:09.600
made myself uncomfortable. I prefer you. We not discuss this. We don't have if you my younger

11:09.600 --> 11:16.640
brother Griffin, though he is not married, he has a he had he is very adept apparently at marriage

11:16.640 --> 11:23.520
because if he could not be right more correct that if you try to combine four years of anniversaries

11:23.520 --> 11:30.240
into one, someday your fiance will remember February 28 as the day Ricky threw himself out

11:30.240 --> 11:34.160
the plate glass window because you're never you're never going to be able to handle that.

11:34.720 --> 11:41.680
You can do maybe one of those be like, hey, I rented out all of Australia. Let's go crazy.

11:41.680 --> 11:48.000
Right. You can't do that twice. It'll kill you. You'll die. I taught our baby to sing or something

11:48.000 --> 11:56.240
tar baby to dance and he sings your favorite song and he wrote it. So the baby wrote your favorite

11:56.240 --> 12:00.560
song and he's three months old. This is our anniversary. Yeah, but I also want to picture

12:00.560 --> 12:06.880
the conversation on the off years where you're like, not this year, baby. No, man, I got something

12:06.880 --> 12:12.640
cooking. I've been down in the lab all week. This is only year one of the four year cycle.

12:12.640 --> 12:17.600
You got three more years of anticipation. Can we fucking just like go to Ponderosa, though?

12:18.240 --> 12:22.160
Can we just like go to Ponderosa? No, no, no. I gotta stay in the lab. I'm gonna sleep straight

12:22.160 --> 12:27.440
through the day. You have to make sure that I don't do anything nice for you. If you can't,

12:27.440 --> 12:34.320
if your wife asks you to take her to Ponderosa and you say no, you don't have a good reason for

12:34.320 --> 12:39.120
that. I guarantee you. But here's the thing. If your wife is asking you to take her to Ponderosa,

12:39.120 --> 12:42.800
you've already set a troubling precedent in your relationship at some point.

12:42.800 --> 12:47.760
You got bigger questions to answer. Yeah, you got bigger questions than exactly how much pudding

12:47.760 --> 12:55.520
can I eat? Yeah. Where can I find an open Ponderosa? What is your driest steak? Give me

12:55.520 --> 13:01.920
your very driest meatloaf. Can you carve a rib off of that giant piece of beef for me?

13:01.920 --> 13:04.640
That actually sounds great. It's our special day.

13:06.640 --> 13:12.800
Honey, I hit a ring inside of your ribs. Your literal ribs. Get it out. Saw six.

13:15.680 --> 13:21.120
This year. All right, this is plenty. Griffin, that's plenty of help. Just don't do that dumb

13:21.120 --> 13:25.920
thing you said that you probably know is dumb. Yeah, you do something every year on the 28th.

13:25.920 --> 13:30.640
Do something every year on the 28th. And couple it with an apology every time.

13:30.640 --> 13:33.600
I got you this and also I'm sorry that we did it on the 29th.

13:34.800 --> 13:38.000
Here's a related question. This one was sent in by Steve Lewis. Thank you, Steve.

13:38.000 --> 13:44.640
It's by Yahoo Answers user Mary Mary X 3 0 who asks. How do I improve my scorpions?

13:46.800 --> 13:51.520
My scorpions are OK, but not the best. How do I improve them? I've been struggling with them

13:51.520 --> 13:59.840
for months. That's it. That's so important. That's the context. Best at what? By the way,

13:59.840 --> 14:04.720
when I said that it was related, I meant. Completely diametrically best in what?

14:04.720 --> 14:11.920
In what capacity? OK, well with scorpions, you have four basic criteria for for judging their

14:11.920 --> 14:17.600
quality. It's there for danger zones, right? Yeah, the four danger zones you've got to worry about

14:17.600 --> 14:24.960
one exoskeleton. Yes, two. What kind of chitin is he working with? Yeah, how do we improve it?

14:24.960 --> 14:31.280
How's your chitin? Is he getting enough vitamin D? That's huge for chitin D is. I say I've always

14:31.280 --> 14:36.000
said what's your what's that motto you always tell people and you have it cross stitched up on

14:36.000 --> 14:44.880
the hanging up there in the den above the fireplace. What is it? It's about. It's it's you gotta have D

14:44.880 --> 14:55.200
if you want. If you don't, if you. Don't shed your don't shed your skin. Don't shed that chitin put.

14:58.240 --> 15:02.240
Yeah, it took it took our mom weeks to stitch exactly that, but Griffin.

15:04.000 --> 15:08.960
And she was not a swearing woman. She did not enjoy swearing, but I would. Griffin was very

15:08.960 --> 15:17.760
specific so armor armor. That's number one. Second, of course, claws. Does it look like a little crab?

15:17.760 --> 15:25.680
Do I know if scorpions have claws? How are the pincers? How are the pincers number three? Obviously

15:27.280 --> 15:36.400
pointy tail. What's in there? Who knows? Caramel poison. I hope I injected some caramel into all

15:36.400 --> 15:42.880
your treats. I'm the best scorpion ever. And then what's the 4th one heat coming off the genitals?

15:43.680 --> 15:48.480
How is how is its genital heat? Also, can you find my scorpions genitals for me?

15:48.480 --> 15:53.520
Also, can I make a 1980s movies called Genital Heat? I've been over this motherfuckers thorax

15:53.520 --> 16:00.560
with a fine tooth comb. No genitals to be found. And also for your scorpion. A big thing is

16:00.560 --> 16:07.840
is how hard did it nail the solo in Rocky like a Hurricane? Because that's vital. That's huge.

16:08.800 --> 16:14.800
For scorpion. Is it possible that this person is actually saying how do I make my band the 1980s

16:14.800 --> 16:23.440
band scorpion better? I bought them from some kind of closeout sale. Got them at Ollie's at the

16:23.440 --> 16:27.760
Grandview weekend outlet on bargain. They just don't have the luster they once did.

16:27.760 --> 16:36.320
Well, that's guaranteed. I one time I thought I stepped on a scorpion. That's a real thing I have

16:36.320 --> 16:42.160
to deal with down here in Texas. In rural areas there there just are scorpions and I have to deal

16:42.160 --> 16:49.040
with the reality that the scorpions are. That's terrifying. For me, like scorpions might as well

16:49.040 --> 16:55.200
be dragons. Yeah, you know, because you never you've never seen one or because they are just

16:55.200 --> 17:01.280
doom bringers there. Well, they're that far from my sphere of reality. Like, yeah, like,

17:01.280 --> 17:04.560
what would you do if you walked out of your front lawn and there was one there right now?

17:05.440 --> 17:11.040
I would. I mean, I don't know what I would. I mean, the reality is so far from I would sooner.

17:11.040 --> 17:15.920
I would be less confused if I saw a naked blonde woman standing in a pile of ashes with three

17:15.920 --> 17:21.920
scorpions crawling on her and talking about how she's going to to lead the Dothraki armies. Like

17:21.920 --> 17:26.560
that was that would be the context in which scorpions would be acceptable. If I just saw one

17:26.560 --> 17:31.760
in like my day to day, I would probably assume that it was the matrix like that that Morpheus

17:31.760 --> 17:36.320
was fucking with me. Oh, something's gone wrong in the in the programming. A hiccup in the

17:36.320 --> 17:41.840
programming. Justin saw a scorpion. So it was wearing a tiny top hat. You would improve this

17:41.840 --> 17:48.960
man's scorpions by making them invisible and also in space. If you see a scorpion in your house,

17:48.960 --> 17:59.440
yeah, your very next stop is a is like a is an open house. Century 21. Yes. Pardon me. I this

17:59.440 --> 18:04.800
is a lovely open house. Thank you for having me. I'll take it. Here's my I cannot sell my old house

18:04.800 --> 18:10.720
because the scorpion lives there now. It's his now. It is now. I'm going to try to charge him taxes

18:11.440 --> 18:16.800
on the sale, but I don't know how the scorpions die. Money. Can we can we improve the the mass

18:16.800 --> 18:22.640
marketability of these scorpions? You guys are missing the obvious answer. What's that, Travis?

18:22.640 --> 18:28.320
Steroids. Travis, I don't think that. Wait, you're running away from me because you want to make

18:28.320 --> 18:34.880
these scorpions like super beefy. I don't know that they have beef. Right. I don't know that

18:34.880 --> 18:42.240
they have beef to to in beefing. You know, I think it's just just. Well, not yet. You got you got to

18:42.240 --> 18:48.480
get him on a regime. It's all chitin and on a regimen. It's chitin and just hate in there.

18:48.480 --> 18:53.600
Maybe you could paint paint paint their shells like hermit crabs. OK, now see, I like that.

18:53.600 --> 18:59.440
Paint the scorpion for human for kids for kids. This is what I'm talking about. Can we make

18:59.440 --> 19:07.520
scorpions the new Furbies? Of course, just a tiny cork on on their stingers. OK, that would be

19:07.520 --> 19:13.120
adorable as though and rubber bands on their claws. Did we talk about the claws? Is that been

19:13.120 --> 19:17.120
verified? That's just that just kind of looks like a scorpion who's into like weird bondage,

19:17.120 --> 19:22.720
which I can't imagine a more terrifying thing. Why do I have? I think scorpions are so hateful

19:22.720 --> 19:28.560
that if you cork their tails and rubber banded their claws that they'd like learn to bite or

19:28.560 --> 19:33.760
learn how to grow things, how to use a gun or just become really spiteful, use their words to hurt

19:33.760 --> 19:43.680
you. Looking fat today, J-Man. Hair's looking a little thin. Not as young as it used to be, J-Man.

19:43.680 --> 19:48.960
So he turns into Beetlejuice. It reminds me of that. It's an old parable. It's an old story of

19:48.960 --> 19:53.920
the frog and the scorpion and the frog gives the scorpion a ride across the river and halfway

19:53.920 --> 19:58.640
across the scorpion starts calling him. I don't know, like fat and stupid and stuff. And the

19:58.640 --> 20:03.920
frog starts crying. It's like, why are you such an asshole? It's in my nature. Yeah. Yeah. And then

20:03.920 --> 20:09.840
he's. But then does he sting him? No, because he's got a tiny cork on his tail. Oh, that's right.

20:09.840 --> 20:15.600
He just batters him with the cork like that. Oh, my eye. Oh, this is my new line of frog

20:15.600 --> 20:24.480
safe scorpions. Each one is $20. Who is the first to buy? Can you imagine a frog with a scorpion

20:24.480 --> 20:30.480
on its back? And the frog is also full of hate. And then like you get that, you get that lethality

20:30.480 --> 20:37.920
of a scorpion with the mobility of a frog. Well, we're done. And the frog is secreting some sort

20:37.920 --> 20:44.560
of hallucinogen. So the scorpion is just freaked out. And also the frog has a really high credit

20:44.560 --> 20:52.800
score. So he's able to like get a house. Why would that be? Why would the scorpion knows the

20:52.800 --> 20:58.080
scorpion knows American Sign Language so we can talk to deaf people? And one of them is played

20:58.080 --> 21:05.440
by Ray Romano. Oh, my God. The frog is Ray Romano. Oh, OK. Oh, and the scorpions played by Tim Allen.

21:05.440 --> 21:11.200
We've got a hit. Listen, this is not the least productive meeting we've had about Madagascar

21:11.200 --> 21:16.400
for yet. And I think I need to go back to the drawing board and really see where we went

21:16.400 --> 21:23.200
astray. I have a theory that it's when we introduce scorpions. Yeah, they ruin everything, including

21:23.200 --> 21:29.120
our Madagascar for production meetings. I'm reading more of this Yahoo answer,

21:29.120 --> 21:35.280
and I think that a scorpion is a yoga position. Oh, moving on.

21:41.200 --> 21:45.760
None of this. None of that was helpful to the person. You don't know. You don't know. You

21:45.760 --> 21:48.640
throw out of the wall. You see what sticks. They might have found something. And here's what it

21:48.640 --> 21:58.640
takes. Scorpions. Their feet are like needles. Yeah. Hey, brothers, there's someone someone

21:58.640 --> 22:05.040
really into yoga that's been screaming at their iPod for five minutes. You dumb motherfuckers.

22:07.120 --> 22:11.920
Hey, brothers, I got out of a two year long relationship in February and I got over her

22:11.920 --> 22:20.720
very quickly, a la the recovery sandwich. Problem is, I'm finding it hard to ease into a relationship

22:20.720 --> 22:26.480
or casual dating. I dove in and started dating another girl. It didn't work out and I got out.

22:26.480 --> 22:29.920
Now I'm seeing another girl, but we went from meeting three weeks ago. She's spending three

22:29.920 --> 22:35.120
or four nights a week at my place in that short and sweet time. What advice do you have for pumping

22:35.120 --> 22:44.160
the brakes to ease into this relationship? That's from Love a Lanch in Louisville. Oh, gosh, this is

22:47.280 --> 22:53.040
this is thorny because here's the thing. It may be maybe it's real. And if that's the case,

22:53.840 --> 22:58.320
then there's nothing there's nothing wrong. But I think the fact that you are asking how

22:58.320 --> 23:08.880
to pump the brakes means that it is moving a little too fast for you. You know, and I see it

23:08.880 --> 23:15.120
a lot and I don't know if we've talked about it before, but when you leave, whatever circumstances

23:15.120 --> 23:22.560
and a long term relationship, there's this just minefield of immediately wanting to get back to

23:22.560 --> 23:28.640
that level of comfort. And it's unavoidable. You're going to do that when you get out of

23:28.640 --> 23:33.600
a relationship and you never really casually dated. Like, yeah, it's the reason that you see.

23:33.600 --> 23:38.720
It's the reason you see rebound so quickly, you know, so often is because it's that it's a weird

23:38.720 --> 23:43.840
kind of it's a weird kind of rebound because it's not like it's not like you're just like

23:45.120 --> 23:51.280
swinging through bars trying to get trim, you know, you're you're trying to find a new replacement

23:51.280 --> 23:56.960
for that, you know, that long term girlfriend. I bet you see this rebound more often than you

23:56.960 --> 24:02.640
see the swinging through bars rebound. Yeah. You may try that for like two days for a weekend.

24:03.920 --> 24:15.760
So my only worry with with rushing this is and I'm not like typically I'm I'm I'm sort of a go

24:15.760 --> 24:21.520
for it kind of guy. I think, you know, whatever, you only go around once and who knows how much

24:21.520 --> 24:26.880
time we have. So just go for it. But I do think that you're going to burn through a lot of good

24:26.880 --> 24:33.760
stuff by moving this too quickly. I mean, there's a lot of getting to know you type stuff that you

24:33.760 --> 24:39.200
lose. I think once you are not lose, but you can miss out on if you rush right into like we're

24:39.200 --> 24:46.320
living together, which is where you are careening towards now. Now, I hate to interrupt Justin, but

24:47.360 --> 24:53.440
it also might be possible. I know it also might be possible that it's just your M.O. because I

24:53.440 --> 24:58.960
know that I am a fast moving person in relationships. So it had nothing to do with,

24:58.960 --> 25:03.760
you know, any kind of past relationship I was getting out of. Just I met my girlfriend,

25:03.760 --> 25:07.200
we hit it off very quickly and we were living together like three months later.

25:07.200 --> 25:12.240
Yeah. You know, three months is a far cry from three weeks. I agree. I agree. But they're not

25:12.240 --> 25:17.520
living together. Yeah. They're just spending three or four nights a week. They met three weeks ago.

25:18.640 --> 25:23.760
I mean, I don't think there's anything if you didn't send in this question to us to ask us

25:23.760 --> 25:31.040
what you should do, then there would be no problem with good point. Like if you if you think like

25:31.040 --> 25:38.800
it, my advice, the best thing I can offer you is to wonder if you are worried things are moving too

25:38.800 --> 25:45.440
fast because like society or your friends say that, or if you're legitimately worried things.

25:45.440 --> 25:50.560
It's not that it's that you've got to have it. It's it's a reasonable level of doubt.

25:50.560 --> 25:56.080
When you get out of a long term relationship, everything in your body tells you, OK,

25:56.080 --> 25:59.600
let's take some time off. Let's just do some quiet reflection because that's the best thing

25:59.600 --> 26:06.240
you can do after a long term relationship is do do like a fucking long debriefing and just like

26:06.240 --> 26:12.880
figure out what went wrong, what qualities in that person drove you away from them and what

26:12.880 --> 26:17.520
qualities in yourself you can improve to make yourself better for the next person and do all

26:17.520 --> 26:24.000
that stuff. And it's hard to do all that stuff when you are like in another beginnings of a long term

26:24.000 --> 26:33.760
relationship that completely discounts the the possibility that you just meet someone really

26:33.760 --> 26:37.680
important. And like, are we going to keep him at arm's length because you got to get your shit

26:37.680 --> 26:43.360
worked out? Well, see, that's why I think like it's really hard to be this kind of self self

26:43.360 --> 26:50.480
reflective. But you got to look at it and say, like, is is any of this forced or was there just

26:50.480 --> 26:55.920
a supernatural, you know, super automatic connection with this person? And I'm worrying

26:55.920 --> 26:59.840
about it too much. Yeah, I think that that's the import. I think that that's the key thing

26:59.840 --> 27:07.680
is just to know thyself. I know. Know why you are doing this and try to, like, take a really sort of

27:10.160 --> 27:15.520
practical look at your own state of being and see why you are moving it so fast,

27:15.520 --> 27:21.520
because if it if it's moving that fast and you don't feel in control, that's a problem because

27:21.520 --> 27:24.720
that's your self conscious trying to push you back into a long term relationship.

27:26.880 --> 27:32.240
As far as pumping the brakes on this relationship, I don't know. I feel like this situation is kind

27:32.240 --> 27:36.560
of ubiquitous for anybody who's ever been in and then out of a long term relationship.

27:37.680 --> 27:42.160
You got to go full disclosure. You got to say, yeah, I got out of this long term relationship.

27:42.160 --> 27:47.680
It didn't work out. I rushed into another one that also didn't work out because we just moved

27:47.680 --> 27:55.040
too fast or whatever. I really like you, but I don't want to, you know, I don't want to move

27:55.040 --> 28:00.000
this thing too fast because the last time I did that, it didn't work out. But I do want to keep

28:00.000 --> 28:06.480
my exclusive deal on dating you. I want to keep an option to move this forward, but I want to keep

28:06.480 --> 28:12.400
exclusivity. Well, that's going to be that might be harder to negotiate. That might be too much.

28:12.400 --> 28:16.240
You've got to have that in the contract. You got to have that in your deal. Don't bring paperwork

28:16.240 --> 28:20.240
into it because that's intimidating. Well, you could have like a non biting mediation.

28:20.240 --> 28:27.120
Okay, good. I would have a get a notary public there and and have them sort of oversee your

28:27.120 --> 28:32.640
conversation and have them sworn to secrecy. Cool. So we were on a tear there for like three

28:32.640 --> 28:36.320
minutes. We're actually saying things that a person could actually do in real life.

28:36.320 --> 28:43.920
You can get a notary public. Yeah. How hard is that? Like, sure. I'm going to try to become one

28:43.920 --> 28:48.480
before the end of this show. And we'll see. And we'll just see who's laughing. Get on Google.

28:49.280 --> 28:58.880
Just Google. You're in the tall grass, my friend. But at least you're not cripplingly lonely.

28:58.880 --> 29:05.600
Yeah. Hey, don't just don't don't psych yourself out. Yeah. Yeah. Just stay yourself and be honest

29:05.600 --> 29:14.000
with her. You are in a completely no matter what you actually want, you completely have the the

29:14.000 --> 29:18.960
moral high ground here. Just be careful that you don't miss out on something really great

29:18.960 --> 29:23.040
because you're second guessing yourself too much. Yeah. Yeah. It may just be the right person and

29:23.040 --> 29:26.400
you may not have met them at the ideal time. And sometimes you just got to roll with it.

29:26.400 --> 29:32.800
Yep. Because if it's the if it's the one, your special one, then you won't burn out living

29:32.800 --> 29:38.320
together. And you know what? I think it's probably just good advice overall to relax,

29:38.320 --> 29:43.120
you know, and maybe that will help you slow down or it will help you take stock of the relationship

29:43.120 --> 29:49.520
as is. So maybe not try to know where it's going and how it's going to turn out and not try to

29:49.520 --> 29:58.720
rush it, but not try to slow down and just take it at its own pace. So breathe. I feel like we just

29:58.720 --> 30:03.440
touched I feel like half of our listeners are probably going through this right now. Yeah,

30:03.440 --> 30:08.480
probably. And I you know what? It's funny because the older the older I get and the more

30:08.480 --> 30:13.680
shows we do, the more I can basically tell a question askers age just from the question.

30:13.680 --> 30:18.240
Because if they're because of a 30 year old person finds 31 like myself,

30:18.240 --> 30:24.320
find someone who wants to be with them. It's like, oh, thank God. God, I'm not going to be alone.

30:24.320 --> 30:30.160
Please sign this. Please sign this. Please, please. I just want I don't want to die. I don't want to

30:30.160 --> 30:35.600
die in front of my Mori Povich. I can't stop eating frozen Frenchman pizzas. All I've been

30:35.600 --> 30:41.680
eating is frozen Frenchman pizzas. Just love me so I'm safe. I'll throw out my tortillas. Just

30:41.680 --> 30:48.240
please don't leave again. I don't know. I'm keeping my options open. We're moving too fast.

30:48.240 --> 30:54.880
Fuck that. Focusing on my career. I'm moving too fast through these empty cartons of Ben and Jerry's.

30:54.880 --> 31:02.720
Please move in with me. Please. I just need something to hang on to. Some kind of lifeline.

31:02.720 --> 31:08.720
I'm drowning here. I'm drowning in my own loneliness. Please. You guys want to do a Yahoo?

31:08.720 --> 31:14.800
Yeah, please. This Yahoo is sent in by Yasmeel Cruz. Thank you, Yasmeel. That's a dope ass name.

31:14.800 --> 31:22.320
Yep, good work. It's by Yahoo Answers user Sydney who asks, how to end a sexting convo?

31:23.760 --> 31:31.840
Please don't judge me first of all. My boyfriend wants to sext me. No pics. But I don't really

31:31.840 --> 31:36.960
want I don't really know how to end the conversation. My friend says she just

31:36.960 --> 31:41.280
doesn't reply. But I don't want to do that. How would I end it? Thanks, smiley face.

31:41.280 --> 31:46.160
You break up with them. Man, I hope that's not my wife.

31:47.840 --> 31:50.080
Justin, it's S-Y-D-N-E-E.

31:50.080 --> 31:54.560
So shit. How do you end a sexting conversation?

31:55.520 --> 32:01.520
I love well, I don't love. I'm terrified by the sentence. My friend says she just doesn't reply,

32:01.520 --> 32:06.480
which to me I'm just imagining like an iPhone where it's all just like one side of a text

32:06.480 --> 32:11.360
conversation. Like I'm touching my penis now. I'm touching it again. I'm touching it a third time.

32:11.360 --> 32:15.040
Do you hear me? I'm still doing it. Yep. Just now I'm just flicking it.

32:17.040 --> 32:23.040
I know you're there. But the best way to end any sexting conversation is to continue the fiction.

32:23.040 --> 32:29.920
So then you text the person. Now I'm going to the bathroom to wash up. I'm taking a quick pee.

32:30.880 --> 32:34.720
I'm seeing what's on TV. It's nothing good. I'm making some eggs.

32:34.720 --> 32:38.560
I was out in the garden for like three hours. I'm like super grody down there.

32:39.760 --> 32:44.640
Wait a minute. Now you're starting off the fiction. You're starting the fiction.

32:44.640 --> 32:50.000
The classic gardener and gardeness fiction. I'm trying to end. I'm saying you end it.

32:50.000 --> 32:53.280
You say like, I just played like six hours of Frisbee golf.

32:55.120 --> 33:01.040
It's super crunchy. It's really, really swampy. That's how you keep from sexting in the first

33:01.040 --> 33:04.720
place. Right. That's what you say. Oh, I've got a real bad headache. So you're saying how do you end

33:04.720 --> 33:14.240
it before you begin? Oh man, I am so bloated. Let's not. Hey, do you smell that? I ate a whole

33:14.240 --> 33:21.760
Subway footlong. Just let me sleep. I wish I'd gotten Golden Corral first. Let me sleep off this

33:21.760 --> 33:27.840
footlong. The only thing on the footlock was black olives. I think I'm septic.

33:27.840 --> 33:34.960
Hey, does this look infected to you or what? Oh, my stuff is pickled. Please let me sleep.

33:36.960 --> 33:44.080
I got some real bad bubble guts. Oh, Christ. I'm on a family plan. I'm on a family plan with my dad.

33:44.080 --> 33:54.400
Please stop. I don't get free texting. Oh, my hair's falling out. You keep interrupting my games

33:54.400 --> 34:03.360
to draw something. How am I supposed to Fruit Ninja with this? Please no. Hold on. Let me put my leg on.

34:07.360 --> 34:17.440
Oh, shit. No, that's not fair. The McCarthy woman's beautiful. Jenny McCarthy? No,

34:17.440 --> 34:22.240
Jenny McCarthy can ramp a Volvo into a pile of flaming shit for all I care. I hate her.

34:22.240 --> 34:28.720
I'm talking about Mrs. Paul McCartney, the one-legged lady who's so sweet. She's very good.

34:28.720 --> 34:42.720
Okay, so sexting endings. Buh-bye. Just is like, nope. Is that not? Nope. Thanks, but no.

34:42.720 --> 34:49.840
No, you are not touching it. Yeah, I disagree. You could subvert their fiction. That's good.

34:49.840 --> 34:57.600
I start unzipping my pants, and then it gets stuck, right? It's stuck, and you're hopping around the room,

34:57.600 --> 35:02.080
and you're like- And you realize you put your underpants on backwards, and the flap's on the other side.

35:02.080 --> 35:07.360
And then you're hopping around so much that you fall over, and your head hits the corner of an end table.

35:07.360 --> 35:15.840
Oh, God, you're bleeding. Not like this, God. Not like this. Not again. You smell smoke coming from the door.

35:15.840 --> 35:20.400
Do you touch it with the back of your hand, or go to sleep? Create a choose your own adventure!

35:20.400 --> 35:27.600
Turn to page 57. Oops, you died. You found the cave troll. You can try again on page 38.

35:27.600 --> 35:33.040
Maybe this time don't grab the magic sword, by which I mean your dick. You encounter a troll.

35:33.040 --> 35:40.000
Check your satchel to see what you have with you. North. You go north and die in the fires.

35:40.000 --> 35:45.600
Please don't try to fuck me on my phone. It's my dad's phone. Why do you keep texting my dad?

35:45.600 --> 35:46.960
I called you from this number once.

35:52.960 --> 35:58.080
Is it this hard? Can't you just- I'm starting to think the non-response is the way to go, though.

35:58.080 --> 36:08.400
Yeah. No, because that's- No, that's giving them free reign to just- To just molest you with words.

36:09.200 --> 36:13.360
I wouldn't let someone send me a romantic novel that they wrote about me and them.

36:13.360 --> 36:17.600
You know what I mean? That's- You say you wouldn't?

36:17.600 --> 36:20.000
I would not. I probably would.

36:20.000 --> 36:24.720
I was gonna say. If somebody called you- If it was well written. If the syntax was good.

36:25.840 --> 36:28.960
If it had vampires, because that's huge right now. That's real big.

36:30.320 --> 36:36.640
Just like biting a wiener. Is that- I don't know. Don't-

36:36.640 --> 36:37.600
Wait, what?

36:37.600 --> 36:42.800
Like the vampire, like, drinks wiener blood. Isn't that why it's so hot right now? It's like

36:42.800 --> 36:50.640
the thought of like- I'm imagining, isn't that why vampire sex, when you do mouth stuff, the fangs?

36:50.640 --> 36:51.280
For pleasure.

36:53.440 --> 36:54.720
Just keep going.

36:54.720 --> 36:57.280
Yeah, keep going. I gotta know more about this.

36:57.280 --> 37:02.000
I don't know. I don't understand why vampire sex is so great and why it's so hot in the TV.

37:02.000 --> 37:05.360
Only thing I could think of, mouth stuff, fangs. Good.

37:05.360 --> 37:08.480
Oh, okay. All right. I think I'm kind of with you now.

37:08.480 --> 37:10.560
So you put two and two together and make gross.

37:11.200 --> 37:12.000
Yeah.

37:12.000 --> 37:13.760
Okay.

37:13.760 --> 37:14.800
I've never sexted.

37:16.480 --> 37:19.680
I don't think anyone above the age of 15 has ever sexted.

37:20.480 --> 37:22.960
I bet you're probably wrong on that front, Trev.

37:22.960 --> 37:26.800
You think? I'm just trying to imagine, like, how one as an adult, like,

37:26.800 --> 37:30.400
with a job out in the world starts that without being embarrassed.

37:31.520 --> 37:34.240
Well, like, have you ever done karaoke?

37:34.240 --> 37:34.560
Yeah.

37:34.560 --> 37:37.120
It's basically the same thing. Okay.

37:37.120 --> 37:39.920
So you get a couple drinks in you, and then you just roll with it.

37:39.920 --> 37:42.000
You're home, home in your bathroom.

37:42.000 --> 37:45.200
You watch someone else do it really badly, and you're like, I can do better than that.

37:45.200 --> 37:45.760
Yeah.

37:45.760 --> 37:46.480
Yeah.

37:46.480 --> 37:48.160
I could sext you. Let me sext you better.

37:49.200 --> 37:50.320
I can sext you better than that.

37:50.320 --> 37:51.840
Step aside. Let me show you. Let me show you.

37:51.840 --> 37:52.480
Step aside.

37:53.200 --> 38:00.160
What I really want is a written permanent record of my feeble, humiliating attempts to be sexy.

38:00.160 --> 38:02.480
That's great. That's fantastic.

38:03.840 --> 38:07.600
How quickly can you get this on Reddit? That's my question.

38:07.600 --> 38:09.200
How quickly can we spread this around?

38:09.200 --> 38:13.280
I want everyone to know what a Lothario I am with the texting.

38:14.800 --> 38:17.360
That's why it's also important that you include pictures.

38:17.360 --> 38:18.400
Oh, yeah.

38:18.400 --> 38:22.960
But because, you know, you can trust the person that just texted you, hey, show me your dick.

38:22.960 --> 38:23.200
Yeah.

38:24.000 --> 38:27.920
Well, I think I would put a little bit more flavor in your ear than that.

38:28.640 --> 38:32.320
What would you rank us off? What's that thing you had crossed in?

38:32.320 --> 38:34.480
I'm so turgid right now.

38:35.200 --> 38:38.480
Okay. Okay, I'm turgid.

38:38.480 --> 38:40.800
I just went from flaccid to engorged.

38:40.800 --> 38:43.360
My member is voluminous.

38:44.400 --> 38:45.760
It keeps glowing.

38:45.760 --> 38:49.360
It's billowing. It looks like a beautiful parachute down there.

38:50.000 --> 38:51.680
I meant to talk to you about that, actually.

38:53.840 --> 39:00.160
I don't think anybody should be sexting because it's a sin because no babies can come of it.

39:01.920 --> 39:04.160
So obviously my religion doesn't permit it.

39:04.160 --> 39:04.400
Sure.

39:05.040 --> 39:06.720
It's got to be for procreation.

39:06.720 --> 39:09.680
You disapprove of rumping for the very same reason.

39:11.200 --> 39:13.120
Yeah, I'm sorry, is that the butt?

39:14.320 --> 39:15.200
Rumping?

39:15.200 --> 39:15.440
Yeah.

39:17.200 --> 39:18.080
Oh, God.

39:18.080 --> 39:19.040
It obviously is.

39:19.040 --> 39:24.000
What if you sext a rumping fiction?

39:24.000 --> 39:25.120
Sext a rumping fiction.

39:26.400 --> 39:28.000
That's my favorite Belle and Sebastian song.

39:30.320 --> 39:36.000
Do you mean like saying like, I don't know, can we not?

39:36.000 --> 39:38.160
No, I backed out of this.

39:38.160 --> 39:39.280
Yeah, I'm like done.

39:39.280 --> 39:39.840
I don't want to do this.

39:39.840 --> 39:47.200
I prepare my fanny, send, wait, response.

39:48.160 --> 39:48.560
Nope.

39:50.720 --> 39:53.120
I powder my fanny in preparation.

39:53.120 --> 39:58.480
You know that fanny doesn't necessarily mean what you think it means across the universe, right?

39:58.480 --> 40:00.480
What is a fanny in other parts of the universe?

40:02.560 --> 40:03.520
It's a vagina.

40:03.520 --> 40:04.560
Holy shit.

40:04.560 --> 40:07.760
Holy shit.

40:07.760 --> 40:08.880
My butt's a vagina?

40:16.320 --> 40:17.440
That didn't make any sense.

40:19.120 --> 40:22.080
Pretty much nothing we've said for the past 40 minutes, Jesus.

40:22.720 --> 40:25.120
First law and order, now the word fanny.

40:25.120 --> 40:27.360
Is there anything the UK can't ruin?

40:28.400 --> 40:32.400
You guys are so lucky that we got into the Doctor Who and we're helping you out on that.

40:32.400 --> 40:34.000
Yeah, we'll fix it, don't worry.

40:34.000 --> 40:35.600
You guys can't be trusted with anything.

40:37.760 --> 40:38.240
You know what?

40:38.960 --> 40:40.560
You know what you can trust us with?

40:40.560 --> 40:41.760
What's that Justin?

40:41.760 --> 40:42.560
Your money.

40:53.840 --> 40:56.640
Of course, we don't want you to give us your money.

40:56.640 --> 41:02.480
We want you to give your money to our dear friend, Brintle Floss.

41:02.480 --> 41:06.000
Yes, and this isn't one of those bullshit internet friendships.

41:07.600 --> 41:09.280
This is real world.

41:10.160 --> 41:11.360
Travis, tell us about Brint.

41:12.160 --> 41:17.200
Well, I met Brint my freshman year of college and we've been friends ever since.

41:17.200 --> 41:18.000
That's not true.

41:18.000 --> 41:20.320
Freshman year of college, we did not like each other.

41:20.320 --> 41:23.600
But then we moved in together sophomore year, still not liking each other,

41:23.600 --> 41:26.240
and then we became best friends and lived together for three years

41:26.240 --> 41:28.000
and have been friends for like the last decade.

41:28.000 --> 41:29.120
Here's some great advice.

41:29.120 --> 41:29.840
Don't do that.

41:30.400 --> 41:31.920
No, it actually worked out really well.

41:31.920 --> 41:35.360
I would recommend it to anyone because if you move in with like your best friend,

41:35.360 --> 41:37.520
you're going to annoy each other and ruin it.

41:37.520 --> 41:39.680
If you move in with someone that already kind of annoys you,

41:39.680 --> 41:42.720
you'll actually find all kinds of things that you have in common

41:42.720 --> 41:45.520
and things that you really like about each other and become best friends.

41:45.520 --> 41:46.720
But let's not focus on that.

41:46.720 --> 41:48.400
Let's focus on Brint.

41:48.400 --> 41:50.160
What's Brint do, Travis?

41:50.160 --> 41:51.840
What's his game?

41:51.840 --> 41:53.600
Honestly, he's brilliant.

41:53.600 --> 41:54.320
I'll tell you this.

41:54.320 --> 41:56.720
My brother, my brother and me would not exist without Brint.

41:56.720 --> 42:02.480
Brint is an internet comedian and basically he takes all kinds of video game music

42:02.480 --> 42:05.200
and writes video game inspired music,

42:05.200 --> 42:08.640
basically adds lyrics and does really funny YouTube videos.

42:08.640 --> 42:12.000
And he's just put out a second CD called Bits of Me

42:12.720 --> 42:14.640
and I got to listen to a sneak preview of it.

42:14.640 --> 42:18.000
And it is both hilarious and at some points, moving.

42:18.640 --> 42:20.640
Travis, you got that sneak peek.

42:20.640 --> 42:21.520
You want to hook us up?

42:21.520 --> 42:23.120
Give us a taste.

42:23.120 --> 42:29.360
Yeah.

42:29.360 --> 42:30.080
Zelda!

42:30.080 --> 42:30.560
Why?

42:30.560 --> 42:31.600
Why, it's me!

42:31.600 --> 42:32.720
It's little Linky!

42:32.720 --> 42:33.600
Don't you know me?

42:37.040 --> 42:41.200
Meet me in the dungeon, dear

42:41.840 --> 42:45.760
Or wherever danger's near

42:46.640 --> 42:50.480
How I miss your little baby face

42:50.480 --> 42:55.280
In my arms, though, you're out of place

42:55.280 --> 43:00.080
How I love the thought of you in chains

43:00.080 --> 43:03.760
Please get kidnapped again

43:03.760 --> 43:09.200
Be my damsel, but be in distress

43:09.200 --> 43:13.280
Please let me have a second quest

43:13.280 --> 43:19.120
So you like Zelda, you like Mario, Mega Man, Star Fox, Castlevania 2, Contra, Banjo-Kazooie.

43:19.120 --> 43:23.280
He riffs, I could say, can I say riffs?

43:23.280 --> 43:30.800
He riffs on all of those in musical styles, ranging from rock to bluegrass to Dixieland jazz.

43:31.920 --> 43:32.320
They got more guests.

43:32.320 --> 43:34.880
And the best part about it, even if you don't know about those video games,

43:34.880 --> 43:39.920
like my girlfriend, we just listened for, you know, I made her listen to his first CD.

43:39.920 --> 43:41.040
She loved it, ate it up.

43:41.040 --> 43:43.200
And she doesn't know half the video games that are on there.

43:43.920 --> 43:45.600
So he's brilliant.

43:45.600 --> 43:46.160
He's brilliant.

43:46.160 --> 43:47.120
He's great.

43:47.120 --> 43:49.520
And the thing is, you can get his new CD.

43:49.520 --> 43:55.120
You can preorder it until April 26th for $12.99.

43:55.120 --> 44:05.760
You just go to Brentalfloss, B-R-E-N-T-A-L-F-L-O-S-S.com and preorder it and then say,

44:05.760 --> 44:09.840
like, hey, I'm preordering this because I heard about it on NBNB AM.

44:09.840 --> 44:16.480
If you go to Brentalfloss.com, you can also listen to some samples, I'm sure, of his work.

44:16.480 --> 44:22.000
And while you're there, you can also see the webcomic that he puts out in which he and I are roommates.

44:22.720 --> 44:27.920
And it kind of tells some real, some made up stories of our time together as roommates.

44:28.720 --> 44:33.200
Um, has he written a song with music from Shenmue in it?

44:34.720 --> 44:35.440
Not yet.

44:36.720 --> 44:41.120
Has he written a song with music from Seaman in it?

44:42.400 --> 44:43.120
Not yet.

44:43.120 --> 44:45.120
What's the point?

44:45.120 --> 44:46.880
NFL 2K5.

44:47.840 --> 44:48.560
Yes.

44:48.560 --> 44:49.280
Okay.

44:49.280 --> 44:53.920
Brentalfloss.com, go right now, preorder it.

44:53.920 --> 45:01.520
You only have until April 26th, so you've got, like, three days to get this CD and you're going to want it.

45:01.520 --> 45:02.960
I've already preordered mine.

45:03.600 --> 45:06.960
I could not be more excited to enjoy it and I would suggest you do the same.

45:07.600 --> 45:09.760
Brentalfloss.com.

45:10.480 --> 45:12.560
Travis is Brent's roommate.

45:12.560 --> 45:14.080
You can't trust Travis on this.

45:14.080 --> 45:15.840
Me, I hate the guy's guts.

45:15.840 --> 45:16.960
I just love his music.

45:17.600 --> 45:21.600
I preordered it and I can't stand to be within 100 miles of the guy.

45:21.600 --> 45:28.080
So take it from me, an unbiased, an unbiased listener of music and enjoyer of it.

45:29.760 --> 45:30.880
Brentalfloss.com.

45:31.760 --> 45:33.920
Now, Griffin, are you going to sing a song?

45:33.920 --> 45:34.720
No, fuck that.

45:35.840 --> 45:37.360
Should we just play another clip then?

45:37.360 --> 46:07.120
I float towards you, it's deep and it's blue, sink or swim.

46:08.320 --> 46:15.120
Baby, don't go, love it here.

46:15.120 --> 46:25.120
Wait for me, I'll come and set you free.

46:25.120 --> 46:33.120
But until then, I'll keep on swimming in the sea.

46:33.120 --> 46:38.320
I have a good, loyal, kind friend who is tragically incapable of romantic success.

46:38.320 --> 46:47.840
He is constantly too drunk lamenting his last rebuke to lay down game on the next potential.

46:47.840 --> 46:49.120
You want to try that again?

46:49.120 --> 46:51.120
Yeah, let me just try.

46:51.120 --> 46:59.440
So he's too hurt from his last refusal from a girl to flirt with the next girl.

46:59.440 --> 47:00.240
Thank you.

47:00.240 --> 47:02.240
What are some good wingman moves?

47:02.240 --> 47:08.160
I can use to get him hooked up so he will be happy and stop complaining.

47:08.160 --> 47:09.840
That's from Dating Delegate in Davis.

47:10.640 --> 47:18.880
Can we get rid of the defiction of the wingman?

47:19.760 --> 47:25.440
I don't think that it's possible for anybody to get anybody else laid.

47:26.160 --> 47:28.160
See, this is the problem, Griffin.

47:28.160 --> 47:29.360
If they don't have the magic inside of them-

47:29.360 --> 47:35.840
The wingman is a real position, but we as a society have the wrong concept of it.

47:35.840 --> 47:39.680
The wingman, as far as I understand it, wingman is code for,

47:40.320 --> 47:43.680
I am married, but I have a great excuse for flirting with girls.

47:43.680 --> 47:44.560
Exactly.

47:44.560 --> 47:45.040
That's basically-

47:45.040 --> 47:52.560
Wingman, you are there to be the non-threatening guy who backs up your friend when he fails.

47:52.560 --> 47:57.360
You can't throw an alley-oop to somebody who's taking a nap in the press box.

47:57.360 --> 47:59.440
Right, you know?

47:59.440 --> 48:00.560
Slam a jammer.

48:00.560 --> 48:02.160
They're not going to jam that slam.

48:02.160 --> 48:04.480
The ball will fly free.

48:04.480 --> 48:08.640
Okay, so let me, because I wish that someone had told me this when I was like 23

48:08.640 --> 48:10.640
and thought I was being a good wingman.

48:10.640 --> 48:12.000
This is not a good move.

48:12.640 --> 48:14.160
Walking up to a girl and saying,

48:14.160 --> 48:18.080
listen, my friend over there thinks you're really cute,

48:18.080 --> 48:21.120
but he's too nervous to come over and say anything.

48:21.120 --> 48:21.920
You should-

48:21.920 --> 48:23.520
Don't, don't do that.

48:23.520 --> 48:24.560
Why would you do that?

48:24.560 --> 48:27.600
No, don't do that.

48:27.600 --> 48:30.720
Travis actually did a not bad job of it.

48:30.720 --> 48:32.160
I've never told you this before.

48:32.160 --> 48:32.720
Oh, thank you.

48:33.520 --> 48:41.120
Travis's jam was, it was very similar to have you met Ted on How I Met Your Mother.

48:41.120 --> 48:44.480
He would just go up to a girl and just say,

48:44.480 --> 48:45.920
hey, this is Griffin.

48:45.920 --> 48:48.400
And then ghost disappears.

48:49.680 --> 48:51.120
That's all, that's really all.

48:51.120 --> 48:56.720
The hard part about meeting people isn't like coming up with a clever thing to say.

48:56.720 --> 48:59.600
It is coming up with a salutation.

48:59.600 --> 49:00.640
That's all you need.

49:00.640 --> 49:04.480
And if you do it right, you also provide good conversation material

49:04.480 --> 49:08.000
so your buddy can be like, I'm sorry, Travis is an asshole.

49:08.000 --> 49:09.840
You know, I am Griffin.

49:09.840 --> 49:12.960
You know, like you're not only opening the door,

49:12.960 --> 49:16.880
you're also creating something to talk about at first.

49:16.880 --> 49:20.080
Yeah, you can found your relationship on your mutual dislike of your brother.

49:20.080 --> 49:20.800
That's what I'm saying.

49:20.800 --> 49:22.720
I think the important thing about being a wingman

49:22.720 --> 49:25.920
is being willing to embarrass yourself so that your friend doesn't have to.

49:25.920 --> 49:28.800
Here's my problem with wingman or ladies.

49:28.800 --> 49:32.800
I know, see, I think ladies prefer pack hunting.

49:32.800 --> 49:36.000
I think pack hunting metaphors are better for the ladies.

49:36.000 --> 49:37.600
They seem to travel in packs.

49:37.600 --> 49:39.520
So like an alpha and beta.

49:39.520 --> 49:40.720
Like an alpha and beta.

49:40.720 --> 49:45.280
You gotta kill, wait, the werewolf curse won't be lifted unless,

49:46.080 --> 49:48.000
no, here's my problem with the wingman.

49:48.000 --> 49:52.560
And if I am going to begin a relationship with a new partner,

49:52.560 --> 49:54.960
I don't anticipate ever doing this again.

49:54.960 --> 49:59.520
But in my young days, when I had to,

50:01.200 --> 50:09.360
I can't have my ability to lie stymie by my friend who knows me being around.

50:09.360 --> 50:15.200
Like I'm gonna say a lot of things that aren't true or exaggerations of the truth.

50:15.200 --> 50:18.720
And I can't have my friend look at me like, you're lying.

50:18.720 --> 50:20.080
I gotta be on my own.

50:20.080 --> 50:22.160
If that person does that, they're a terrible wingman.

50:23.360 --> 50:24.880
If they call bullshit on you.

50:26.400 --> 50:27.120
He's lying.

50:27.120 --> 50:30.560
Justin, why are you compulsively lying to women though?

50:31.760 --> 50:33.280
Well, it's not just women, hey?

50:33.920 --> 50:35.520
Compulsively is not-

50:36.560 --> 50:39.040
Men, women, children, babies, goats.

50:39.040 --> 50:39.440
Well, guys.

50:42.160 --> 50:43.680
I'm not saying like lying like-

50:43.680 --> 50:48.000
I've got a real hearty penis.

50:48.560 --> 50:51.200
No, I'm not talking about lying like-

50:51.200 --> 50:53.920
It's like a can of Senka down there.

50:53.920 --> 50:57.760
He's talking about lying like saying things like, no, I'm not afraid of masks.

50:57.760 --> 50:58.720
Yeah, right.

50:58.720 --> 51:01.840
Pretending like I'm not afraid of the robot woman from Superman 3.

51:01.840 --> 51:04.160
Should that come up in casual conversations.

51:04.160 --> 51:05.120
Well, you know who I like?

51:07.440 --> 51:09.680
You know what never scared me?

51:09.680 --> 51:13.360
The HBO logo they used to show for the movies in the 80s.

51:13.360 --> 51:14.960
I never really scared me.

51:14.960 --> 51:17.920
I used to scare the ever loving shit out of you.

51:17.920 --> 51:18.640
It was no big deal.

51:18.640 --> 51:19.920
It was pretty frightening.

51:19.920 --> 51:20.960
No big whoop.

51:20.960 --> 51:26.000
I think to answer your question, it is your job as wingman to not-

51:26.800 --> 51:28.160
It's not a defeat.

51:28.160 --> 51:28.800
That's the thing.

51:28.800 --> 51:31.120
If a girl is like, nah, I'm not interested.

51:31.120 --> 51:34.480
Or even in the worst, shooting you down.

51:34.480 --> 51:37.200
It's not a defeat because you have not lost anything.

51:39.440 --> 51:42.160
And so when your friend starts to like, fuck it.

51:42.160 --> 51:44.960
I'm just going to do like nine shots because she doesn't want to talk to me.

51:45.840 --> 51:47.760
You need to be like, hey, bro, it's not that big a deal.

51:47.760 --> 51:48.560
Don't worry about it.

51:48.560 --> 51:50.240
That's a bigger problem, I think.

51:50.240 --> 51:50.560
Yeah.

51:51.040 --> 51:58.480
I also, guys, I think the term, the idea of the term, the concept wingman has been

51:59.680 --> 52:02.320
just so steeped in so much bro.

52:02.320 --> 52:03.040
I agree.

52:03.040 --> 52:06.960
That it's, I don't even think you can go with the idea anymore.

52:06.960 --> 52:08.160
It's been bromented.

52:08.160 --> 52:11.600
Do you know what your only obligation as a wingman is?

52:11.600 --> 52:11.920
What?

52:11.920 --> 52:14.400
To not make your friend go out to a bar by himself.

52:15.200 --> 52:15.920
That's it.

52:15.920 --> 52:16.560
Really?

52:16.560 --> 52:20.240
If you do that, you're already head and shoulders above anyone else.

52:20.240 --> 52:21.600
You know my ideal wingman?

52:23.600 --> 52:24.320
What?

52:24.320 --> 52:28.800
Somebody who will just buy every other pitcher and play some darts.

52:28.800 --> 52:29.120
Yeah.

52:29.920 --> 52:31.680
That's a pretty good wingman to me.

52:31.680 --> 52:37.680
Well, no ladies tonight, but you threw a real nice 301.

52:38.240 --> 52:40.720
Do you want to know who the world's worst wingman is?

52:40.720 --> 52:42.000
Who's that, Travis?

52:42.000 --> 52:43.840
It is my dear friend Michael Bradbury.

52:43.840 --> 52:45.200
Why is he so bad?

52:45.200 --> 52:49.760
Because he is the most naturally charming person I have ever met.

52:49.760 --> 52:55.040
If you bring a girl within a 15-foot radius of Michael Bradbury, she is lost to you.

52:55.040 --> 52:57.120
Yeah, he can't be too charming.

52:57.120 --> 52:59.360
This is my wingman, John Stamos.

52:59.360 --> 53:00.160
Oh, you're gone.

53:01.360 --> 53:03.280
You're fucking John Stamos in his car.

53:03.280 --> 53:04.000
Great.

53:04.000 --> 53:07.600
I am the perfect wingman because I'm just charming enough

53:07.600 --> 53:10.320
that I don't necessarily come off as a serial killer.

53:10.320 --> 53:12.160
This is my dear friend Michael Fassbender.

53:12.160 --> 53:15.120
He's dark and mysterious and you're making out.

53:16.400 --> 53:18.240
Maybe you've seen his penis in the movies.

53:19.360 --> 53:21.920
He is legally required to take it out during every one.

53:22.960 --> 53:26.960
Here's the one thing that I learned you don't want to do as a wingman.

53:26.960 --> 53:30.080
If your friend starts doing well with a lady or fella,

53:30.080 --> 53:32.560
you don't want to start running around the bar screaming,

53:32.560 --> 53:33.680
how am I going to get home?

53:34.480 --> 53:36.400
My friend is doing well with a girl.

53:36.400 --> 53:37.600
I don't know how to get home.

53:37.600 --> 53:39.200
And then flapping your arms.

53:39.200 --> 53:43.520
You know, Justin, you pointed out something earlier that it's just clicked to me.

53:43.520 --> 53:44.480
That was a great point.

53:44.480 --> 53:45.440
Oh, that's rare.

53:45.440 --> 53:46.000
What'd I do?

53:46.800 --> 53:48.400
Women are pack hunters.

53:48.400 --> 53:48.960
Yeah.

53:48.960 --> 53:52.720
So your job as wingman is to help your friend

53:52.720 --> 53:55.920
not feel like he's singularly approaching a group of women.

53:56.960 --> 53:57.920
So you're there with him.

53:57.920 --> 54:00.800
You're backup to talk to other people.

54:00.800 --> 54:03.280
So you got to tank the other women.

54:03.280 --> 54:04.880
Yeah, but he's rogue.

54:04.880 --> 54:05.920
He goes rogue and you tank.

54:05.920 --> 54:07.600
He goes rogue and you're tanking.

54:07.600 --> 54:09.600
Meanwhile, you can find a wizard.

54:09.600 --> 54:12.720
The druid is in the corner healing you.

54:12.720 --> 54:15.600
And by all means, when you're talking to this special somebody

54:15.600 --> 54:17.120
that you're trying to connect with,

54:17.120 --> 54:18.880
make sure you tell him that you're the rogue

54:18.880 --> 54:20.000
and your friend is the tank

54:20.000 --> 54:21.760
and he's tanking the mobs that came with it.

54:21.760 --> 54:23.200
You're trying to DPS.

54:23.200 --> 54:26.400
If she gets it and laughs, marry her.

54:26.400 --> 54:28.160
Don't, no way.

54:29.200 --> 54:33.840
No, cause she is probably being paid to seduce you, sir.

54:35.200 --> 54:36.320
She is a spy.

54:36.320 --> 54:37.760
She is a spy.

54:37.760 --> 54:38.720
You're a dead man.

54:41.840 --> 54:47.440
This is also such a great reminder of

54:48.240 --> 54:53.040
it's so hard to meet people and found lasting relationship.

54:53.040 --> 54:54.640
How do you meet anybody?

54:54.640 --> 54:55.280
Anybody.

54:55.280 --> 54:56.720
How do you make friends?

54:56.720 --> 54:58.800
You know what I'm coming to realize in my life

54:58.800 --> 55:02.320
is that it's just like when people try to come up with a formula

55:02.320 --> 55:05.600
to help them figure out the winning lottery numbers

55:05.600 --> 55:08.080
or to figure out what stocks are good.

55:08.080 --> 55:09.520
There is no formula.

55:09.520 --> 55:12.080
If I just have this wing man and go to this bar

55:12.080 --> 55:14.560
and say this line, I'll meet the perfect person

55:14.560 --> 55:15.520
and be happy forever.

55:15.520 --> 55:18.720
Your best, the best thing that's working in your favor

55:18.720 --> 55:21.440
is that everybody is equally desperate.

55:22.080 --> 55:23.600
I just want a friend.

55:23.600 --> 55:25.200
Please, please.

55:25.200 --> 55:26.720
I need someone, please.

55:27.280 --> 55:28.880
That could be your opening salvo.

55:28.880 --> 55:30.160
Please, please.

55:30.160 --> 55:31.840
I'm gonna lay it all out of line.

55:31.840 --> 55:32.960
I'm super lonely.

55:32.960 --> 55:36.400
Just a warm body to throw darts with, please.

55:36.960 --> 55:37.920
Please just come hang.

55:40.240 --> 55:43.200
And this is all, this is all of this question

55:43.200 --> 55:45.360
and the answer is all predicated on a fiction

55:45.360 --> 55:47.280
that things are a lot more tactical in a bar

55:47.280 --> 55:48.640
than they actually are.

55:48.640 --> 55:48.960
Yeah.

55:48.960 --> 55:51.440
Really just have enough drinks that you think you're cool.

55:51.440 --> 55:51.680
Yep.

55:52.240 --> 55:54.880
I'm in dire need of advice on smiling.

55:54.880 --> 55:57.200
I simply cannot do it on command for pictures.

55:57.760 --> 55:59.040
It's not that I frown.

55:59.040 --> 56:01.200
I just end up sarcastically smirking

56:01.200 --> 56:03.040
or simply sitting there with my mouth agape.

56:03.040 --> 56:04.960
People, especially my mother and girlfriend,

56:04.960 --> 56:06.720
detest this shortcoming.

56:06.720 --> 56:07.280
Please help.

56:07.280 --> 56:09.440
That's from Expressionless in Pennsylvania.

56:09.440 --> 56:09.680
Wow.

56:09.680 --> 56:10.400
That's a good one.

56:11.120 --> 56:12.240
You know what my jam was?

56:12.240 --> 56:12.720
What was it?

56:13.360 --> 56:16.320
I just found like a funny face.

56:16.320 --> 56:17.280
Like what?

56:17.280 --> 56:19.280
You know, and just pulled that in every picture

56:19.280 --> 56:20.320
for like two years.

56:20.320 --> 56:20.640
Okay.

56:20.640 --> 56:21.360
I did that too.

56:21.360 --> 56:23.840
And it's, I don't recommend it.

56:23.840 --> 56:29.760
I, nobody has taken a good picture of me since 1991

56:29.760 --> 56:32.560
when I was a baby and I got in a basket.

56:33.360 --> 56:34.800
And someone took a picture of that.

56:34.800 --> 56:36.240
But that's what, that's the problem, Griffin.

56:36.240 --> 56:38.400
You used it all up when you were four.

56:38.400 --> 56:40.240
In that one image that I lost it.

56:40.240 --> 56:42.480
That one could be like a National Geographic

56:42.480 --> 56:43.600
like cover of the month.

56:43.600 --> 56:43.760
Yeah.

56:43.760 --> 56:45.280
Babies in baskets issue.

56:45.280 --> 56:45.440
Yeah.

56:46.400 --> 56:48.720
Now National Geographic cover of the month,

56:48.720 --> 56:50.240
is that a contest they run or?

56:50.800 --> 56:52.560
I'm not familiar with National Geographic's

56:52.560 --> 56:53.520
cover of the month contest.

56:53.520 --> 56:56.400
I meant cover of the decade or like cover of the century.

56:56.400 --> 56:59.200
But the time frame I pulled out was month.

56:59.200 --> 57:01.280
I'm pretty sure every National Geographic cover

57:01.280 --> 57:02.720
is a cover of the month.

57:03.440 --> 57:04.000
Yeah.

57:04.000 --> 57:04.880
Shut up, you guys.

57:04.880 --> 57:09.520
When I smile, my teeth do a weird thing

57:09.520 --> 57:11.280
where they like shoot in different directions.

57:11.280 --> 57:13.680
Like a picket fence that got hit by a tornado.

57:13.680 --> 57:16.960
And I get this crease in my forehead that I can't explain.

57:16.960 --> 57:19.280
It's a vertical, which is a weird crease.

57:19.280 --> 57:22.960
And then like my eyes turn like,

57:22.960 --> 57:26.320
I would say like 45 degrees diagonally.

57:26.320 --> 57:30.000
And I look like some sort of horrible ghoul.

57:30.000 --> 57:32.880
Griffin's expression in pictures is reminiscent

57:32.880 --> 57:36.160
of someone who's incredibly excited to be opening

57:36.160 --> 57:40.560
a birthday present, but suspects it may be

57:40.560 --> 57:42.320
the severed head of a dead puppy.

57:42.320 --> 57:45.680
Like he's starting to think like, wait a minute, what if?

57:45.680 --> 57:48.000
It's because you can see behind the eyes.

57:48.000 --> 57:49.440
Behind the eyes, there's terror.

57:49.440 --> 57:51.120
Like it's halfway between a genuine smile

57:51.120 --> 57:52.160
and straight up Godfrey.

57:52.800 --> 57:54.960
Like that's usually where I come in.

57:54.960 --> 57:57.040
If I could land on either one of those extremes,

57:57.680 --> 57:58.800
then it would be fine.

57:58.800 --> 58:00.400
But I mean, that's a McElroy thing.

58:00.400 --> 58:02.160
It's like if we smile too big,

58:02.160 --> 58:03.920
our eyes just automatically close.

58:04.960 --> 58:06.000
I don't know why that is.

58:06.000 --> 58:07.040
I don't see.

58:07.040 --> 58:07.840
I don't know.

58:07.840 --> 58:09.680
My wife gets mad at me because I don't look.

58:10.240 --> 58:11.520
I look silly in pictures.

58:11.520 --> 58:15.200
I'm trying to what is finally started to pull me out of it

58:15.760 --> 58:19.760
is when you're when you're taking the picture,

58:19.760 --> 58:21.840
try to think about how the fact that you're not dead.

58:22.400 --> 58:24.480
But someday someone might look at this picture

58:24.480 --> 58:25.600
and you may be dead.

58:25.600 --> 58:27.280
So you want to look happy about it.

58:27.280 --> 58:28.560
You want to look happy now.

58:28.560 --> 58:29.920
Help cheer them up.

58:29.920 --> 58:30.480
You're gone.

58:30.480 --> 58:31.840
You're not there to take care of them anymore.

58:31.840 --> 58:34.160
So just put a smile on that phrase.

58:34.160 --> 58:35.600
Kind of frown upside down.

58:35.600 --> 58:38.320
You know, it's particularly troubling for me is that

58:38.320 --> 58:40.560
I have a couple of friends here who have nice cameras.

58:40.560 --> 58:42.640
And so they take a lot of pictures whenever we have,

58:42.640 --> 58:44.240
you know, hang out events

58:44.240 --> 58:46.800
and get a lot of candid pictures taken to me.

58:46.800 --> 58:53.520
And I I never just my rest state is not very happy.

58:54.000 --> 58:59.680
I look very, very sad and angry and like lost in thought

58:59.680 --> 59:01.440
pretty much like ninety nine percent of the time.

59:01.440 --> 59:03.920
Is that how people are naturally?

59:03.920 --> 59:07.200
I mean, that's how you are naturally.

59:07.200 --> 59:09.600
I was going to say I'm I'm pretty happy.

59:09.600 --> 59:11.600
Like most of the time I'm smiling a lot.

59:11.600 --> 59:12.880
My eyes are alive.

59:12.880 --> 59:15.120
We are we're at PAX East.

59:15.120 --> 59:16.080
We're in Boston.

59:16.080 --> 59:17.360
Boston last month.

59:18.160 --> 59:21.200
I ran into John Drake, a friend of ours from harmonics.

59:21.200 --> 59:23.520
He said, I ran into Griffin.

59:23.520 --> 59:27.360
I said, yeah, he said, man, that guy is just over it.

59:30.720 --> 59:30.960
What?

59:30.960 --> 59:33.200
That's not the vibe I get from Griffin.

59:33.200 --> 59:33.840
But I don't know.

59:33.840 --> 59:36.000
Griff, maybe you're throwing out that over it vibe.

59:36.640 --> 59:42.160
I think it's just that I'm a very I'm I'm just super intellectual,

59:42.160 --> 59:45.280
you know, just yeah, that's that's probably I'm thinking

59:45.280 --> 59:50.160
about the poetry that I read earlier that day and like what it means to me as a person.

59:50.720 --> 59:55.040
You know, I don't really have time to think about like all the joy that is in life.

59:55.040 --> 59:58.800
See, that's why if someone looks at me and they're trying to figure out what I'm thinking,

59:58.800 --> 01:00:02.800
I'm loudly singing the Doug theme song inside of my head.

01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:04.400
Is that and that kind of keeps me smiling.

01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:06.480
Can someone just like tell me how to be happier?

01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:08.880
Sing the Doug theme song inside of your head.

01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:23.520
I'm just thinking about the Holocaust again.

01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:24.960
Damn it.

01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:26.480
How about Yahoo?

01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:27.440
They usually cheers you up.

01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:32.000
OK, I'm not thinking about the Holocaust.

01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:34.480
How about a Yahoo answer?

01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:38.480
This Yahoo answer is sent in by Steve Lewis is by asked by Yahoo.

01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:40.560
Answers user Jerry Brewer, who asks.

01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:44.560
How do I get my dogs to romantically eat spaghetti?

01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:50.480
I have a cocker spaniel and some kind of mutt.

01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:52.400
I have a little table set up in a replica,

01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:54.880
authentic Italian restaurant built in my basement.

01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:57.600
I have tried everything to get these dogs to eat romantically,

01:00:57.600 --> 01:00:58.960
but they do the exact opposite.

01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:02.560
In fact, they just eat it really fast and fight each other for the spaghetti.

01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:03.920
I don't know what else to do.

01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:05.520
I am very serious about this.

01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:10.000
Please only serious answers.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:14.880
Taxidermy.

01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:15.840
Tiger.

01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:17.280
Tiger can't change his stripes.

01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:19.520
Dogs can't change the way.

01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:21.760
They'll just eat this.

01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:22.720
They'll just eat fucking.

01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:24.240
They'll just eat fucking spaghetti.

01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:25.840
They'll eat anything you put in front of them.

01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:27.680
You can't say.

01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:29.200
Hey, slow down.

01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:32.720
You can't teach a fucking cocker spaniel cotillion, you dummy.

01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:35.600
Well, not, not easily.

01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:36.240
Not easily.

01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:36.960
It takes time.

01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:38.800
I bet Caesar could do it.

01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:39.920
Caesar could.

01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:44.240
Your only hope is to find Caesar, the dog whisperer, to come to your house.

01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:44.640
Yep.

01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:45.360
Yep.

01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:46.560
And the dog's like, oh, he's right.

01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:50.560
He's like, sit, shake, salad fort goes on the left.

01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:53.040
Please put the napkin in your lap.

01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:54.800
No, red wine goes with pasta.

01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:55.520
Damn it.

01:01:55.520 --> 01:01:55.920
Coordinating.

01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:59.200
Your problem is your pasta noodles.

01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:00.400
They're not long enough.

01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:00.640
Yeah.

01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:03.520
Yeah, you need one long noodle.

01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:06.720
You guys want to know God's honest from watching Lady and the Tramp?

01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:10.000
I used to think that spaghetti was made with one big, huge, long noodle.

01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:14.640
Animation has given you that impression for years.

01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:20.400
How many times have you seen a character put a fork into a big plate of spaghetti and turn it

01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:22.160
and turn it and turn it and it's all in the fork?

01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:25.680
And oh my God, I've been on accents for like a week and a half and I'm losing my mind.

01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:28.160
I have to eat something.

01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:28.880
Are you back in?

01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:31.040
Are you back on trying to get that ketosis?

01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:33.680
God, I just really got to get ketosis.

01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:34.800
I got to get fit.

01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:38.080
We got Max Fun Con coming up June 1st.

01:02:38.080 --> 01:02:40.080
I'm going to be hobnobbing.

01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:45.200
I guess I could say hobnobbing with our friends, John Hodgman, John Roderick,

01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:48.160
Chuck Bryant from Some of You Should Know.

01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:55.520
The one takeaway I want everybody to have from Max Fun Con is, wow, Justin has got a hard body.

01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:55.760
Yeah.

01:02:55.760 --> 01:02:56.880
How was your Max Fun Con?

01:02:56.880 --> 01:02:58.000
It was okay.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:02:59.600
Justin was looking great.

01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:04.400
I've never met him before, but I could just tell that his body's gotten significantly harder.

01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:05.680
I think he's on ketosis.

01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:08.880
He's inspired me to make another Long Winter's album.

01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:10.400
I'm really going to finish it now.

01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:12.800
This one's called Justin's Ass is Rockin'.

01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:15.200
Yeah, it's called Rockin' Justin's Ketosis Fine Ass.

01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:19.360
So anyway, yeah, I just really would like some pasta.

01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:24.400
I'm literally considering, well, I'll actually get some spaghetti squash for lunch.

01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:28.160
Is that where you take squash and you noodle it down?

01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:29.520
You get it in the spaghetti?

01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:31.520
No, it's like a type of squash.

01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:36.320
You cook it in the microwave for like six minutes, and then you scrape it with a fork,

01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:40.240
and it's basically like spaghetti noodles.

01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:40.960
Basically.

01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:43.040
Wow, that sounds really sad.

01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:44.080
That sounds like the saddest.

01:03:44.800 --> 01:03:45.600
Well, it's healthy.

01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:46.320
You like health.

01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:48.640
You want to live forever, don't you?

01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:49.040
I do.

01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:49.200
No.

01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:56.000
I'm never going to die.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:56.880
Oh, youth.

01:03:56.880 --> 01:03:58.160
I remember that feeling.

01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:01.680
Going around, sex anything that walks.

01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:02.800
Drinking anything.

01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:04.160
Sexting anything that can read.

01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:07.520
Drink anything that'll melt.

01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:08.880
I've been there.

01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:11.760
Eating anything that casts a shadow.

01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:14.000
Eating anything that casts a shadow.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:15.600
I've lived that life.

01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:18.320
Shooting up anything that walks.

01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:19.520
I've been there.

01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:21.360
We've all toured with the stones.

01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:22.400
You guys aren't cool.

01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:24.000
Snorting anything that'll grind.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:24.880
Ah, god damn it.

01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:27.280
What are you going to go with?

01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:31.920
Putting long cylindrical objects in your ears.

01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:35.600
Making, putting down anything that'll congeal.

01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:36.160
I've been there.

01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:38.000
Experimenting.

01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:39.520
It's the 80s.

01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:44.880
Something about your butthole and doing stuff to it.

01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:47.680
Picking stuff up with your butthole.

01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:48.320
You've been there.

01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:50.400
I was in Blue Man Group.

01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:52.000
I know how these things go.

01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:54.080
I know how kids are.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:57.600
Are we helping this guy with the dogs?

01:04:59.120 --> 01:05:00.640
I wasn't paying attention.

01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:06.720
Yeah, I pretty much erased him from the planet with my thoughts.

01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:08.480
Perfect for choosing these questions.

01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:11.440
You'd think he would choose people that he thinks we can help.

01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:13.040
People who we can reach out to.

01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:17.120
I imagine it would be easier to find people willing to dress up like Lady in the Tramp

01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:21.920
and eat spaghetti for you in your tiny basement Italian restaurant than to train dogs to do it.

01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:26.640
There is only one way that fucking short story ends and it's with Chop, Chop, Chop,

01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:30.800
Trunk Clothes, Broom, Lake, Park, Splash.

01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:32.400
Well, that's the end.

01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:34.000
That's the whole Lifetime movie.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:35.840
Lifetime movie, book.

01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:38.160
And all that would be predicated on jerk, jerk, jerk, jerk, jerk.

01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:40.800
Jerk, jerk, jerk, jerk, jerk, jerk.

01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:42.800
Chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop,

01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:43.680
chop, chop, chop.

01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:46.720
Trunk, drive, jerk, jerk, jerk a little bit, splash.

01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:49.360
Jerk, jerk, jerk to fall asleep.

01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:51.520
Get home, clean up the spaghetti.

01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:52.160
Lifetime movie.

01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:54.080
And jerk it to the Lifetime movie.

01:05:54.080 --> 01:05:55.600
Go to the office the next day.

01:05:56.560 --> 01:05:57.120
How was your weekend?

01:05:57.120 --> 01:05:57.840
Tell everyone about it.

01:05:57.840 --> 01:05:59.040
Oh, it was great.

01:05:59.040 --> 01:06:00.640
How was your weekend, President Obama?

01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:03.840
Horrible secret revealed.

01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:06.160
What a reveal though.

01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:13.440
This episode of my brother, my brother and me was paid for by the campaign to elect Mitt Romney.

01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:17.600
President Obama is definitely, definitely a lady in the Tramp murder fetishist.

01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:20.160
He's the lady in the Tramp killer.

01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:22.800
Connor, good job.

01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:24.640
Good job, FBI.

01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:26.720
Nice job, Sherlock.

01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:29.200
Oh, I'll say Sherlock.

01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:34.640
How long before, how long before presidential campaigns start taking us to the money zone?

01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:42.720
Would you guys even care like who, who we affiliated ourselves with as long as we got

01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:45.600
that, do I care?

01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:45.840
Yeah.

01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:49.200
If we got like a big enough hunk of that super pack pie.

01:06:50.320 --> 01:06:52.720
Oh, you saying that I would do Nader.

01:06:53.280 --> 01:06:53.600
Yeah.

01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:54.320
And a heartbeat.

01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:55.040
He's got that.

01:06:55.040 --> 01:06:55.520
Right.

01:06:55.520 --> 01:06:56.560
He's coming back.

01:06:56.560 --> 01:06:58.160
I'll do Gingrich at this point.

01:06:58.160 --> 01:07:00.000
Just because he's adorable.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.240
And by do you're talking about fucking them, right?

01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:02.960
No, Griffin.

01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:06.080
I would do an ad for them, a commercial for them.

01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:13.280
You haven't looked at Gingrich's chunky dumps and been like, I could, I could see myself in that.

01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:16.320
No, I, I no way.

01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:19.680
Cause I'm planning on having cancer someday and I want somebody who's going to stick by me.

01:07:21.680 --> 01:07:24.240
That doesn't, that doesn't fit the bill with him at all.

01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:26.080
See now we'll never get sponsors.

01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:26.480
Great.

01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:27.680
Damn it.

01:07:27.680 --> 01:07:28.400
Damn it.

01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:30.320
We're never going to get political ads at this rate.

01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:30.880
Oh shit.

01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:34.000
So, Hey, this has been our advice show.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:37.040
My brother, my brother, me, it's modern era and everything.

01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:38.800
I'm Justin, the oldest one.

01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:39.120
Whatever.

01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:41.280
I'm Travis and I'm the middle.

01:07:41.280 --> 01:07:42.800
Why are we doing it again?

01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:43.840
No, we're starting again.

01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:44.720
I want to do it over.

01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:45.440
I did it wrong.

01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:48.240
Thanks to everybody tweeting about the show.

01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:55.360
We want to welcome our new Tony award-winning fan, Lin-Manuel Miranda.

01:07:55.360 --> 01:07:58.320
It's super good to have you on board.

01:07:58.320 --> 01:08:00.000
Thanks to everybody else tweeting about the show.

01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:01.920
If you get a Tony, let us know.

01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:03.360
We'll say your name on the show.

01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:03.520
Yeah.

01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:05.520
That's, that is the new barrier for entry.

01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:08.960
We hit 100 and we just raised the stakes.

01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:10.480
Rod as I roar.

01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:12.320
RD awesome.

01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:14.560
Our dear, dear friend, Eric Nier.

01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:16.400
Sean Fish.

01:08:16.400 --> 01:08:17.920
I almost said Travis McElroy.

01:08:18.480 --> 01:08:18.800
Yay.

01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:20.320
Hooray for me.

01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:22.080
Incredible K.

01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:27.040
Uh, Joseph Bloomberg, Thrashworth, Ross Butler, everybody.

01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:31.760
Flame Drake's, uh, we, we super appreciate, uh, everybody tweeting about the show and,

01:08:31.760 --> 01:08:33.920
and, and helping us to spread the word.

01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:39.920
Um, you're the only reason that we are still doing this and the fact that we like to talk

01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:42.240
to each other, but other than those two things, that's the only reason.

01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:44.480
So thank you for spreading it.

01:08:44.480 --> 01:08:50.880
If you get a second this week, um, tweet about the show with the NBNB AM hashtag and make

01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:53.280
sure to include that bit.ly forward slash.

01:08:53.280 --> 01:08:54.080
It's my boom, bam.

01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:58.080
That's our sampler and it's a fun way to get people in the program or just tell a friend

01:08:58.080 --> 01:08:59.440
about it in the meat space.

01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:00.480
Yeah.

01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:04.960
Tell a real world friend if you can still have those, um, just hand them a CD and say

01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:05.760
you're welcome.

01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:06.260
Yeah.

01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:08.880
And then make them listen to the podcast.

01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:13.920
Uh, I want to thank everybody who, who gave us well wishes on our hundredth episode.

01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:15.280
That meant a lot to me.

01:09:15.280 --> 01:09:18.720
Um, I also want to thank John Roderick and the long winters for the use of our theme

01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:19.120
song.

01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:22.400
It's a departure off their album, putting the days to bed.

01:09:22.400 --> 01:09:29.680
Uh, it's a, it's a super good album and that song is on it and it's a super good song.

01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:34.080
So, so go purchase that on Amazon, MP3 and iTunes and vinyl.

01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:37.520
And I want to thank rental floss for sponsoring this week's episode.

01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:42.880
Make sure to go to rental floss.com and pre-order the CD pre-order ends on April 26.

01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:46.080
So hurry up, Griffin, bring us home.

01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:48.720
This final Yahoo answer was sent in by Mike Sherwin.

01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:49.440
Thank you, Mike.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:57.200
It's by Yahoo answers user, Mr. Dang, who asks, how long have you had a crush on Gary

01:09:57.200 --> 01:09:57.920
Busey?

01:09:59.920 --> 01:10:01.360

I'm Travis McElroy.

01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:03.600
I'm Griffin McElroy.

01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:05.360
This is me, my brother, my brother and me.

01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:06.320
It's your dad.

01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:07.680
School wear on the lips.

01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:14.640
Keep your heart three stacks.

01:10:14.640 --> 01:10:16.080
Keep your heart three stacks.

01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:17.040
Keep your heart.

01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:19.200
Hey, keep your heart three stacks.

01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:20.240
Keep your heart.

01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:22.240
Man, these girls are smart three stacks.

01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:23.360
These girls are smart.

01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:45.600
Play your part, play your part.
