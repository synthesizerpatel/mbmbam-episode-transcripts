WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:31.120
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:31.120 --> 00:45.120
It's a new craze, and good girls do you wanna just say, hey I wanna, just say, hey I wanna.

00:45.120 --> 00:51.520
Whatever happened, nope, nope, whatever, nope, to the nope, nope,

00:51.520 --> 01:01.920
no, you miss your old familiar friends, waiting just around the bend, step by step, family matters,

01:01.920 --> 01:10.880
it's what matters with your family, family matters, well there must be some magic Jews behind these

01:10.880 --> 01:18.960
temple walls. We've talked about that right? Now we do the dance of joy.

01:18.960 --> 01:26.640
Hi everybody, welcome to our Fuller House special. Fullest house. Fullest house. We're

01:26.640 --> 01:35.600
gonna be recapping every episode of the show as we enjoy it. And we're gonna smoke a million

01:35.600 --> 01:41.040
cigarettes while we do it apparently. Yeah, Justin ate a bunch of lit cigars. I'm your

01:41.040 --> 01:46.720
DJ Tanner, Justin McElroy. I'm your Stephanie Tanner, Travis McElroy. I'm your sweet baby

01:46.720 --> 01:51.520
brother, Griffin McElroy. I do wanna say that- Hey, can you fucking like just get-

01:51.520 --> 01:54.720
Okay, I'm gonna- You know what, we're gonna do it again and we're gonna pretend like Griffin

01:54.720 --> 02:00.320
listens to the show when we record it. I'm your DJ Tanner, Justin McElroy. I'm Stephanie's

02:00.320 --> 02:05.440
cleavage, Travis McElroy. No, I'm not gonna follow that because that's fucking gross. I'm

02:05.440 --> 02:12.720
your Stephanie Tanner, Travis McElroy. And I'm Lil Richie from Family Matters.

02:12.720 --> 02:18.400
And Michelle, like Michelle. I don't wanna do that because she's not apparently still

02:18.400 --> 02:24.560
a friend of the fam. She's in the extended universe now. Fuller House, let's get some

02:24.560 --> 02:31.520
quick reactions. Travis, what was the best- I watched the first 15 minutes of the first

02:31.520 --> 02:36.800
episode. So just to give some context of how much I'm able to speak on it, go. Okay, it's

02:36.800 --> 02:43.760
27 minutes long, so I really just couldn't stick in there. It's when Steve reentered

02:43.760 --> 02:48.080
the world that I had to step away. Oh no, that's he's the best part, so you're a fool.

02:49.360 --> 02:55.280
I'm gonna go ahead and say Uncle Jesse when he sang Forever. Griffin used dig and just

02:55.280 --> 02:59.600
fucking disappeared from the room. I burrowed through our nice new hardwood floors and I

02:59.600 --> 03:07.200
disappeared from the room. There was a moment in which Stephanie picks up DJ's baby and

03:07.200 --> 03:12.880
makes a comment about her breasts that I had to walk away from the computer on which I

03:12.880 --> 03:16.960
was walking and be like, I don't know what this is, but I'm very upset. I don't like

03:16.960 --> 03:22.800
what's going on. If I could just make a humble suggestion to you two, hang in there. Because

03:22.800 --> 03:32.560
um, later on, okay, in literally like the third episode, um, Stephanie is running the

03:32.560 --> 03:41.760
veterinary clinic that DJ runs and she gets herself sprayed by a skunk and her children,

03:41.760 --> 03:47.200
DJ's children, get sprayed by skunks too. There's a shot where DJ walks in, opens the

03:47.200 --> 03:57.040
door to a room where Stephanie is taking a naked bath in tomato juice with DJ's baby

03:57.040 --> 04:04.240
and her nephew is in another cistern full of tomato juice because it gets the skunk smell

04:04.240 --> 04:12.400
out and they're just two cisterns full of tomato juice and there is no, no physical

04:12.400 --> 04:18.960
way that her six year old nephew did not see her naked. It just couldn't happen.

04:18.960 --> 04:22.960
Here's what I love. What this, it reminds me a lot of Girl Meets World, which was the

04:22.960 --> 04:29.520
Boy Meets World spinoff many decades later. Or Fuller Boys. Fuller Boys was the original

04:29.520 --> 04:35.520
name of that show. Fuller Boys. Or Family Anti-Matters, which is where the negative

04:35.520 --> 04:40.240
versions of all of them, that's where the Stephane Kael came from. I'm parallaxer Kael.

04:40.240 --> 04:45.040
Yeah, like that, it reminds me a lot of those spinoffs. I mean like, I just really, you

04:45.040 --> 04:53.600
guys should hang in there. There's a scene later in the season where DJ's son Max, his

04:53.600 --> 05:00.000
dad died fighting fires and he lied to his classmates about his ability to get a fire

05:00.000 --> 05:06.080
truck to show up at a kid's birthday party. So Danny Tanner decides to try to right this

05:06.080 --> 05:18.160
wrong. There's a scene in Fuller House where a fire chief doesn't let the, a fire truck

05:18.160 --> 05:24.960
attend the birthday party of a little boy whose dad died fighting fires because Danny

05:24.960 --> 05:33.440
Tanner didn't let the fire chief sing on local television 28 years ago. Like, just hang in

05:33.440 --> 05:38.800
there. Is that canon though? Is there an episode of Full House in which there's a fire chief

05:38.800 --> 05:44.640
who wants to sing on Wake Up in San Francisco and Danny's like, fuck you, this will never

05:44.640 --> 05:48.960
come back to bite me in the ass. And then they were planting that seed. That would be,

05:48.960 --> 05:53.200
okay, Travis, that would literally be like incredible if Fuller House is about them like

05:53.840 --> 05:59.760
reaping what they had sown. Like the count of, in the all too tidy storytelling of the first

05:59.760 --> 06:04.400
eight seasons of Full House. That would be the most incredible show. I just, all I care

06:04.400 --> 06:09.040
about is Steve's whole fucking style of literally walking into a house being like, yo, I know

06:09.040 --> 06:13.760
your husband just got all burnt up. That's a bummer. But whenever you're ready, I'm ready

06:13.760 --> 06:18.320
to hit that. By the way, let me get some, let me get some pudding. And I don't mean that

06:18.320 --> 06:21.840
sexually. I'm not talking about that widow pudding, unless that is what you call the

06:21.840 --> 06:26.400
snack packs that you got in the refrigerator. But I will take both. There's a moment in which

06:26.400 --> 06:33.760
a gentleman describes Kim and Gibbler as being just amazing at sex. That's her husband, Travis.

06:33.760 --> 06:40.480
Well, her estranged husband. I'm just saying that the picture of Kim and Gibbler just dominating

06:40.480 --> 06:46.480
in the bedroom made me laugh so hard. Makes perfect sense. Yeah. We got that locked in.

06:48.480 --> 06:54.960
I'm just saying I get it. When I think about Kim and Gibbler, I think raw, pure animal sexuality.

06:54.960 --> 06:56.560
Okay. By the way-

06:56.560 --> 07:05.200
I'm just saying that I think Kim and Gibbler is sex. Is sex. Like when I think sex, I'm just-

07:05.760 --> 07:07.040
I feel like you guys don't get it.

07:07.040 --> 07:09.760
Aphroditic spiritual manifestation of sex.

07:09.760 --> 07:15.200
You know those like the statue goddesses that represent fertility and sex? That's

07:15.200 --> 07:22.160
Kim and Gibbler to me. And not in a weird way, not in a weird way, but in a very pure-

07:22.160 --> 07:25.360
You're saying if you ended up in the Gibbler shed,

07:25.360 --> 07:29.760
you would not complain about what happens in there.

07:29.760 --> 07:33.920
Yeah. That's basically it. Thank you for summing that up so clearly.

07:33.920 --> 07:39.600
The Gibbler shed is like there's a hole in the back of it that she then crawls through

07:39.600 --> 07:45.360
and then walks 20 feet and then, hey, tannerinos. Kimmy, what's that fucking smell? Don't worry

07:45.360 --> 07:53.840
about the smell. Hey, it's impolite to ask about the Gibbler smell. Oh, gross. Don't put your feet

07:53.840 --> 07:59.600
up on the table. Oh, if you only fucking knew. Where do these feet have been?

07:59.600 --> 08:03.440
If you only fucking knew. I turned two men into basically house slippers.

08:05.200 --> 08:08.400
You wouldn't believe what goes on in the Gibbler shed.

08:08.400 --> 08:10.240
Gibble gobble. I gotta go.

08:10.240 --> 08:12.800
We got cisterns full of tomato juice in there.

08:12.800 --> 08:20.080
An important update. When DJ walked in on her naked sister with her kids and a cistern

08:20.080 --> 08:28.800
of tomato juice, DJ's response was, oh my lanta. And she has said, oh my lanta an average of eight

08:28.800 --> 08:34.560
times per episode. Her little son, Max, his hot catchphrase. And I'm going to start working this

08:34.560 --> 08:39.360
in the art show because that's how this stuff becomes memetic. I'm not going to tell you what

08:39.360 --> 08:43.200
it is. I'm just going to work it in at some point. Excellent. And you tell me if you feel like we've

08:43.200 --> 08:48.640
come up against it, okay? Okay. Does that sound like a deal? Yeah. So everybody is just like on

08:48.640 --> 08:53.760
the lookout. Now, should we identify it or should it be like the listeners right in and the first

08:53.760 --> 09:00.400
person to identify it? I think if you guys are just seeing Quad City DJs, there it is. When you

09:00.400 --> 09:06.240
think that you've heard it, then I think that'll be perfect. You got it. Hey, let's do some advice.

09:06.240 --> 09:12.000
Yeah. Hell yeah. Is that it? Before we start, can we talk about- Wait, is that the catchphrase?

09:12.000 --> 09:17.520
What did you think of CRJ's intro, Griff? I don't love it. I didn't want to talk about it on the

09:17.520 --> 09:22.400
show because I didn't want to betray my girl. It's not her fault. Obviously, I don't think she

09:22.400 --> 09:28.880
arranged the fucking thing, but just the verses are just a mess. She is the greatest pop performer in

09:28.880 --> 09:33.120
the world right now. And those choruses show exactly what she's capable of bringing to the

09:33.120 --> 09:39.040
table. And then the verses are just her singing over that fucking skanky blues riff from the

09:39.040 --> 09:45.440
original. Like, squank, squa-ding-a-ding-dink. Hey, sing for me. Squink-a-dink-a-dunk. No,

09:45.440 --> 09:49.600
that's not her shit. Don't make her do not her shit. Just let her do the whole thing.

09:50.640 --> 09:54.480
Let her star in it. I wanted to talk about real quick, the Max Fun Drive's coming up. We're all

09:54.480 --> 09:58.480
very, very excited for the Max Fun Drive. We're going to talk more about it. It's a fun time of

09:58.480 --> 10:04.560
year. We have fun stuff planned. We're doing for our bonus episode for donors. Can we talk about

10:04.560 --> 10:10.080
it? Because it's, fellas, it's bananas. We're doing My Brother, My Brother, Me's Second Chances,

10:10.080 --> 10:15.440
where we go back to questions from the first 10 episodes of the show and we try them again,

10:15.440 --> 10:19.840
just to see if our advice game has gotten any better. At least our audio game has. Our audio

10:19.840 --> 10:24.400
game definitely has. Hey gang, I don't know if you've gone back and... First of all, if you're

10:24.400 --> 10:28.240
a listener and not a creator of the show, don't go back and listen to those episodes because we

10:28.240 --> 10:36.560
used to be... I'm going to go ahead and call us man ghouls. We used to do questions and we would

10:36.560 --> 10:46.080
spend literally a minute and 15 seconds on each one. Yeah. The Yahoo questions used to be the least

10:46.080 --> 10:51.120
interesting question. It used to be like, this question comes from Yahoo. I had a bad date.

10:51.120 --> 10:57.440
And I was like, wait, that was what we chose for Yahoo answers back then? Yeah. Man, it's a... Wow.

10:57.440 --> 11:00.640
A different show. Anyway, the next one drives coming up soon. We'll talk more about it later.

11:00.640 --> 11:05.200
Great. Are you feeling up to this, Justin? Because you do sound like you ate a bottle.

11:05.920 --> 11:11.040
You sound like Ursula stole your voice. And you're just through sheer force of will,

11:11.600 --> 11:15.600
just trying to get it back. You're kind of making the sounds even though Ursula stole your voice,

11:15.600 --> 11:21.920
just by slapping your face and moving your lips up and down. You sound like how Fuller House makes

11:21.920 --> 11:30.000
me feel. All right. Well, does somebody else want to read? No, I want you to do it. It's your fucking,

11:30.000 --> 11:36.640
it's your job. Yeah. I mean, it is my job. Okay. But now you're just luxuriating in it.

11:36.640 --> 11:41.360
I'm luxuriating you in it, actually. Oh, good. Me now and me editing me,

11:41.360 --> 11:47.600
future edit Griffin, who man, he is a big fan of Justin. Yeah. Really? Do you like that?

11:47.600 --> 11:52.480
Yeah. He likes all the sniffs and the secret chewing that you do.

11:53.440 --> 11:59.280
I want to make one last note about Fuller House. It made me laugh the hardest of anything. Todd

11:59.280 --> 12:05.760
Vanderwerf, who works for Vox.com, the same company as us, but he said, Fuller House made

12:05.760 --> 12:11.760
me feel like I was an empty burlap sack shaped like a man and I was full of bugs and the bugs

12:11.760 --> 12:20.080
move me around. He made him feel like Oogie Boogie. Basically, yes. Here we go, babies.

12:20.080 --> 12:26.400
Listen, I recently met a lovely girl and we hit it off. Now you do sound like Oogie Boogie.

12:27.200 --> 12:31.520
She seems to be attracted to me and I definitely have a thing for her as well.

12:32.240 --> 12:40.320
But things get a little difficult sometimes because she's 19 and I am 24. How do I go about

12:40.320 --> 12:48.240
wooing a younger lady as from an older man, the oldest superhero? Now, Griffin, when you go back

12:48.240 --> 12:52.880
and edit that, I want you to change the pitch of that up 50%. No, I love it. I love it because

12:52.880 --> 12:57.520
first of all, there is no better question for him to exercise that particular voice for.

12:57.520 --> 13:01.600
For me to put a little soul in your bowl. Yeah. Well, soul is one way of putting it. I would put

13:01.600 --> 13:05.600
it like it sounds like your vocal cords are just two big hands just slapping together and I can

13:05.600 --> 13:11.280
hear each individual slap of them. Tell that. It sounds like the eruption of a volcano is

13:11.280 --> 13:16.240
asking this question. Tell that to all the confused young ladies and dudes out there who

13:16.240 --> 13:25.440
just got a little moist. Oh, no. How is a dude- If only your throat was a little moist. I mean,

13:25.440 --> 13:30.080
I know I talk about how often I flood my basement, but physiologically, what is that?

13:30.080 --> 13:34.080
He peed his pants. All the confused young gentlemen whose Justin's voice made him

13:34.080 --> 13:41.040
pee his pants. Yeah. I mean, fuck, we have to talk about this at some point throughout the show,

13:41.040 --> 13:46.160
but the older you get, age is not a thing. When there's a one as the first digit,

13:46.160 --> 13:49.760
that time gap is harder than say if there was a two in the first digit.

13:49.760 --> 13:56.720
Well, what it is, Griffin, is it's not a problem of age really. There's two other bigger factors,

13:56.720 --> 14:02.480
and that is one, if she is still in college and you are out, you are existing in two different

14:02.480 --> 14:08.480
worlds. Two, it's also a question of amount of responsibility you've had to face and the amount

14:08.480 --> 14:14.000
of maturity you have to actively use on a day to day basis. That's not to say that there aren't

14:14.000 --> 14:19.600
super mature 19 year olds, but it's a muscle. I don't know if you guys are being willfully

14:19.600 --> 14:28.880
obtuse here, but the problem is not the gap. The problem is 19 because it's not 21 and 24

14:28.880 --> 14:35.760
is above 21. Where do you take them? One of you can party. What are you doing? Do you want to

14:35.760 --> 14:42.400
meet my friends? Where are they at? Well, let's see. It's a night, so they're at a bar right now.

14:42.400 --> 14:51.200
They're at a bar. Unless this is super special and you're investing and this is like, I can't do shit

14:51.200 --> 14:58.160
with you now, but you're awesome and I love you and I really care about you. In two years, we'll

14:58.160 --> 15:04.880
be able to hang out with everybody and it's worth it, but that's such a big investment. A time,

15:04.880 --> 15:10.080
especially if this person is like studying and going to class and doing stuff, their time is not

15:10.080 --> 15:17.840
their own. Don't screw up their future. Counter unless. Is this unprecedented? I don't think you

15:17.840 --> 15:27.520
can unless and unless. Combo breaker. Reless. What if it's love? Wait, that was mine though.

15:27.520 --> 15:33.760
Hold on. That was my unless. You can't reless my unless when I literally. You didn't say it. You

15:33.760 --> 15:41.120
weren't explicit enough, Travis. So this is like a super less. Yeah. I've underlessed you. Hey,

15:41.120 --> 15:46.240
I got a Yahoo and this one here is from Zoe Kinski climbing that ladder. Thank you, Zoe.

15:46.240 --> 15:50.880
Did you guys know that on the Mabim Bam Wiki, there is a fucking scoreboard of people who've

15:50.880 --> 15:56.240
gotten Yahoo's on the show? Well, that helps us determine. Is the Mabim Bam Wiki still a

15:56.240 --> 16:02.320
going concern? Yeah, it's popping off. Nice. I used it to get our second chances questions.

16:02.320 --> 16:08.000
Anyway, thank you, Zoe. It's by Yahoo Answers user Karasu, who asks, if I am talking on the

16:08.000 --> 16:12.800
phone in my underwear, can people tell by my voice that I am in my underwear? I would say

16:12.800 --> 16:19.040
if it sounds like Justin sounds right now, yes. Yeah, 100%. Justin, you just got that underwear

16:19.040 --> 16:23.200
voice right now. What will it sound like if you're in your underwear? How will it sound different?

16:23.200 --> 16:28.720
I think it sounds okay. Does it sound relaxed or does it sound like someone who hopes you don't

16:28.720 --> 16:33.200
notice they're just in their underwear? I've had dreams where I've been in my underwear in public

16:33.200 --> 16:38.720
and I don't remember feeling super chill about it. Yeah. Can we try and experiment real quick?

16:38.720 --> 16:42.560
Okay. Yeah. Okay. Hey, everybody, this is Griffin McElroy. Thank you for listening to

16:42.560 --> 16:46.080
My Brother, My Brother and Me. It's a comedy advice podcast that I do with my two brothers,

16:46.080 --> 16:53.360
Justin and Travis. Hey, everybody. This is Griffin McElroy from My Brother,

16:53.360 --> 16:55.040
My Brother and Me, a podcast I do with my brothers.

16:57.280 --> 16:59.680
So I think it sounded basically like exactly the same to me.

16:59.680 --> 17:02.480
Was the first one in underwear and the second one was in clothes?

17:03.360 --> 17:05.840
They're both clothes. So that's what you've just said is a synonym.

17:06.400 --> 17:09.520
Oh, I thought that that was like one of those trick questions where it's like a taste test,

17:09.520 --> 17:13.680
but they're both Pepsi and you hadn't actually changed anything at all except the tone of your

17:13.680 --> 17:19.040
voice. Did you just say one of those trick questions where they're both Pepsi?

17:19.040 --> 17:25.840
You know. You know when they do a taste test. They're like jokes on you. Which one do you

17:25.840 --> 17:30.240
like better? The one on the right is Pepsi, but they tasted very... No, no, no. You got it. You

17:30.240 --> 17:33.600
won. You won. You won. In the commercial. Shut the company. Stop filming. In the commercial.

17:34.640 --> 17:42.080
You know. Because we couldn't stomach giving you any brand. We just want to give you delicious

17:42.080 --> 17:46.640
Pepsi. Wouldn't that be a great taste test if it's just like which Pepsi tastes better?

17:47.920 --> 17:51.840
Well, that one's very old and we poured it five hours ago and it's very warm.

17:51.840 --> 17:56.960
That's a barrel aged Pepsi. That's midday sun aged Pepsi.

17:56.960 --> 18:00.640
Do you guys ever think about just your physical state of being when you're

18:00.640 --> 18:04.560
talking on the phone with somebody? Because I actually do feel very self-conscious right now.

18:04.560 --> 18:12.560
Um, my main thing is I don't get, I try not to get too physically comfortable because I

18:12.560 --> 18:17.280
don't want to be on the phone for a second longer than I have to. So I'm probably like

18:17.280 --> 18:24.000
pacing around like, uh, is this still happening? Am I still on the phone? It will, they have,

18:24.000 --> 18:28.880
my body language is saying this, like, are they going to hang up soon? Can I just hang up and

18:28.880 --> 18:32.320
pretend I lost service? If you get a phone call from somebody then,

18:32.320 --> 18:38.880
would you put pants on? Cause I know like sort of your usual state doesn't involve

18:39.920 --> 18:46.800
the wearing of trousers. Um, I, no, I don't. I would leave the room

18:47.680 --> 18:52.960
because it drives me fucking crazy to be on the phone with people, with other people in the room

18:52.960 --> 18:57.600
or vice versa. There's something that, can I say something? Cause I used to just, I've been doing

18:57.600 --> 19:01.280
this for a couple of minutes now, uh, and now it's, it is starting to get kind of exciting.

19:01.280 --> 19:03.520
Being in your underpants? Yeah.

19:03.520 --> 19:05.280
Talking to your two brothers? Yeah.

19:05.280 --> 19:07.600
Is it exciting to talk to your brothers in your underwear?

19:07.600 --> 19:10.720
In your underpants? No, no, no. You don't understand. And it's not sexual.

19:10.720 --> 19:12.640
Clearly. I hope I don't understand.

19:13.600 --> 19:16.880
It's not a sexual thing. It's not gibbler. You're not gibblering.

19:16.880 --> 19:21.680
No, no, no, no. God, no. God, I would need, I don't have the harness, but I'm saying that,

19:21.680 --> 19:27.840
and by harness, I mean just full body. It's like a saran, it's like a sexual saran, right?

19:27.840 --> 19:33.920
Um, uh, yeah, like, yeah, it's, it's weird. What does this mean?

19:33.920 --> 19:37.200
Do you feel free? Griffin, let me ask you this. Do you feel free? Do you feel good?

19:37.200 --> 19:40.480
Do you feel, is it like the thrill is what's making you feel alive?

19:40.480 --> 19:42.800
No, it's like, it's like challenging.

19:43.680 --> 19:45.280
Like how long will you do it?

19:45.280 --> 19:49.680
Yeah. I'm probably actually going to go ahead and slap those shorts back on.

19:49.680 --> 19:52.000
Let's go ahead and get those shorts back on.

19:52.000 --> 19:55.680
Let's get those shorts back on, but let's understand that there's still shorts. You know

19:55.680 --> 19:58.080
what I mean? Like what's up with America's hangups?

19:59.200 --> 20:00.320
Holy chalupas.

20:01.600 --> 20:01.840
What?

20:01.840 --> 20:03.600
Wait, whoomp, there it is.

20:03.600 --> 20:04.880
Yeah, Trev's got it first.

20:04.880 --> 20:05.380
Yeah.

20:06.560 --> 20:10.160
What? What? No.

20:10.160 --> 20:13.280
Hey, Griffin, hear it one more time. Holy chalupas.

20:14.480 --> 20:17.520
What is that? Wait, what is chalupas replacing there?

20:18.720 --> 20:19.440
Dog shit.

20:19.440 --> 20:26.720
I, you're on Netflix. What? They should have made it fucking hard R.

20:26.720 --> 20:32.240
NC17 Fuller House would have been so, just to hear a little eight-year-old be like,

20:32.240 --> 20:36.400
holy shit. What the fuck? Why are we in fucking vats of-

20:36.400 --> 20:38.080
What if they called the show fucker house?

20:39.600 --> 20:41.280
Um, there's a scene where-

20:41.280 --> 20:42.480
Oh my God.

20:42.480 --> 20:42.720
Okay.

20:43.360 --> 20:44.560
No, please.

20:44.560 --> 20:51.600
There's, the best joke in Fuller House is that Stephanie Tanner became a DJ named DJ,

20:51.600 --> 20:55.360
and called herself DJ Tanner. It's a really fucking good joke.

20:55.360 --> 20:56.960
It's actually pretty solid.

20:56.960 --> 21:01.840
It's like a solid, it's like really funny. And there's a scene where she's playing Coachella

21:02.960 --> 21:09.600
because DJ Unbreakable broke his arm. And she gets a video call from her nephew Max,

21:09.600 --> 21:16.880
who's nervous about playing a school concert. And to, to help his nerves, she fucking flips

21:16.880 --> 21:23.360
the switch on her iPhone and live streams him playing Old MacDonald Had a Farm.

21:24.080 --> 21:25.600
To the Coachella audience?

21:25.600 --> 21:26.560
On his trombone.

21:26.560 --> 21:29.280
And that's supposed to make him feel less nervous?

21:29.280 --> 21:34.960
Well, the idea is like, you just played Coachella, right? But like,

21:34.960 --> 21:41.680
like he's playing Old MacDonald Had a Farm on his trombone. And when he finishes,

21:41.680 --> 21:43.680
the reaction he gets is nothing.

21:46.240 --> 21:53.120
The audience is fucking deadpan. Like, are you serious? Is this the new sound? Are we old now?

21:53.120 --> 21:56.320
Like that's what being old is when you go to Coachella and everything sounds like

21:56.320 --> 22:01.120
eight year olds playing trombones. Like, oh gosh, I guess I don't get the sound anymore.

22:01.120 --> 22:05.200
Yeah. Kendrick, uh, he's got a tight opener. He's, uh, he's called Trombone Boy

22:05.760 --> 22:09.120
and he's sick as fuck. What's his set? Like, what's he do? Well, you know,

22:09.120 --> 22:13.840
Chill Wave? Yeah. It's nothing like that. It's a horn with like a slidey bit on it.

22:13.840 --> 22:15.120
Can I read another question?

22:15.120 --> 22:19.920
Hey, can we just fucking cancel this episode and just release like the audio from a 28 minute

22:19.920 --> 22:21.040
episode of Fuller House?

22:21.040 --> 22:24.240
That'll be the second half. That's after the money's done. It's just going to be all Fuller

22:24.240 --> 22:25.040
House.

22:25.040 --> 22:30.160
Yeah. I would like to do something like that just to see like what happens.

22:30.160 --> 22:32.320
Like what is, what happens?

22:32.320 --> 22:34.320
How litigious are their lawyers?

22:34.320 --> 22:41.360
Like what? No, but here's what I'm asking. What happens? Like if we make the second half

22:41.360 --> 22:46.000
of an episode, not a second half, I would just want to pin it to the end of a full length

22:46.000 --> 22:51.280
episode, right? Cause I don't want people to get cheated. But like what happens?

22:51.280 --> 22:51.760
What happens to-

22:51.760 --> 22:57.040
And we just put all the audio from a Fuller House episode at the end of our episode.

22:57.040 --> 22:57.760
What happens?

22:57.760 --> 23:01.360
If we edit in fart sounds, is that fair use? Is that how fair use works?

23:01.360 --> 23:02.880
You know, yeah. Cause that would be a criticism.

23:03.440 --> 23:03.920
Okay.

23:04.480 --> 23:04.720
Yeah.

23:05.360 --> 23:07.440
I've just figured out fair use.

23:07.440 --> 23:12.000
I mean, how, how it's, it's all about, it's all about economies of scale, right? Cause

23:12.000 --> 23:17.120
Justin, you, you said you've already, we've already stepped, put our foot into the ocean

23:17.120 --> 23:22.160
by saying Holy Chalupas and Oh My Lanta and talking about Kimmy Gibbler's Sex Dungeon

23:23.440 --> 23:27.200
and Gibbler Sex Rap, which is now a product you can buy on Extreme Restraints.

23:27.200 --> 23:33.360
There's a whole Gibbler line of, of, you can get a Gibbler, Gibbler Sex Rap.

23:33.360 --> 23:36.640
You can get Gibbler, the Gibbler Harness. You can get the Gibbler Gobbler, which is a-

23:36.640 --> 23:38.640
You can get, um, Nipple Gibblers.

23:39.680 --> 23:42.720
You can get, um, a Gildo.

23:45.920 --> 23:46.480
Uh-huh.

23:46.480 --> 23:50.480
That's actually, I think, a monster from Zelda. Anyway, um-

23:50.480 --> 23:52.240
That's the one that eats your shield, right?

23:52.240 --> 23:59.200
Yeah. And this thing, this product will also eat your shield, if you know what I'm talking about.

23:59.200 --> 23:59.920
I don't.

23:59.920 --> 24:00.880
Yeah, please explain that to me.

24:00.880 --> 24:04.320
What would your shield relate to in a sexual manner? Like, the condom?

24:05.360 --> 24:13.200
Yes. It's a, it's a female condom that eats and negates both. It's a bad product. It's a bad

24:13.200 --> 24:16.080
product. You shouldn't use the, the Gildo.

24:16.080 --> 24:18.560
Don't use the Gildo. They're being recalled.

24:18.560 --> 24:24.320
Uh, because it'll also take your rupees away. I forgot what I was talking about.

24:24.320 --> 24:25.680
I'm going to read a question.

24:25.680 --> 24:26.720
Please.

24:26.720 --> 24:27.760
It's my birthday.

24:27.760 --> 24:28.480
Cool!

24:28.480 --> 24:33.760
Yeah, nice. Some people at the office put up a small banner and a couple of signs at my desk.

24:33.760 --> 24:34.640
I appreciate this.

24:34.640 --> 24:37.200
What are the, what are the signs? It is your birthday.

24:38.000 --> 24:39.280
Birthday here.

24:39.280 --> 24:40.160
Have it.

24:40.160 --> 24:40.640
What?

24:40.640 --> 24:45.520
I appreciate this and thank everyone for the well wishes. Problem is, I'm a pretty neat person. I

24:45.520 --> 24:50.400
feel like I enjoyed the decorations enough and want to take them down. How long do I have to leave

24:50.400 --> 24:56.720
these up? Can I take them down at lunch or is it an all day affair? Tidy and Tulsa. That was a way

24:56.720 --> 24:58.800
shorter timeframe than I thought you were going to say.

25:00.080 --> 25:05.600
Oh boy. Howdy. I get it. This is an office. We're doing business here.

25:05.600 --> 25:05.840
I'm trying to keep my-

25:05.840 --> 25:08.720
Nice, nice. Thanks for these. And then you immediately start pulling them down.

25:08.720 --> 25:12.720
I'm trying to keep my fucking job, but I can't, I can't reach the hole puncher.

25:12.720 --> 25:15.040
Cause you put a sign up over it that said-

25:15.040 --> 25:16.960
Holy chalupa, it's your birthday.

25:16.960 --> 25:18.960
Holy chalupa, it's your birthday.

25:18.960 --> 25:24.000
I get it. I get it. I don't want that shit around. I mean, I work at home and I mean,

25:24.000 --> 25:26.800
you guys have forgotten the past few birthdays I've had, which is fine. Like whatever.

25:27.760 --> 25:32.000
So like I, I would, I would absolutely tear that shit down.

25:32.000 --> 25:36.240
But when Griffin, but when, not if, when.

25:36.240 --> 25:42.240
Yeah. You can't do it as they're like, like show like, and like, Oh great. Trash, trash, trash.

25:42.240 --> 25:46.960
Thank you. This is so thoughtful. Trash can, trash can, trash can.

25:48.240 --> 25:51.280
I'm going to, I'm no, no, no, no. I'm not undecorating. I just want to

25:51.280 --> 25:54.800
save all of them. So I'm going to put them here in my memory bin.

25:55.360 --> 25:59.280
Cut the middleman out. Just show him a trash can full of decorations. Say,

25:59.280 --> 26:02.960
Hey, we're going to put these up. And then we didn't. So we kind of saved you the work.

26:02.960 --> 26:06.640
Here's what you have to do. You have to wait until everyone leaves at the end of the day.

26:06.640 --> 26:09.360
Like you're the last person there. And then you take them all down.

26:09.360 --> 26:14.160
And then when you come back in the morning, walk in and scream, who took down all my decorations

26:14.160 --> 26:17.840
and get really upset about it. So you can prove to them how much you cared about it.

26:17.840 --> 26:21.040
All right, cool. But you realize this is an annual event. And so like,

26:21.680 --> 26:26.080
you realize people have birthdays every year. Well, so then the next year you have to loudly

26:26.080 --> 26:30.160
announce, I'm going to keep an eye on these. So nobody takes them down this time.

26:30.160 --> 26:33.440
And then when they come in, you fall asleep at your desk, still dressed in the clothes you

26:33.440 --> 26:38.240
were from last night and all the decorations are down and you're like, Oh no, not again.

26:38.240 --> 26:40.240
Greg Bacchitis Academy.

26:42.560 --> 26:47.200
Maybe you print out a bunch of signs and banners that say thanks for the birthday stuff.

26:47.200 --> 26:51.600
And you put that, but that's like twice as much. And you put them all up over everybody's stuff.

26:51.600 --> 26:54.640
Like while they're working, like while they're like doing a webcam meeting,

26:54.640 --> 26:58.480
you like paste a big sign over it that says thanks for being so thoughtful.

26:58.480 --> 27:02.800
And you put like six of them up there with like rubber cement. And it's like, Oh, I just,

27:02.800 --> 27:06.960
I just was just returning the favor, but maybe think about like how your actions have consequences.

27:06.960 --> 27:11.840
Also, we just raised our office supply expenses by 5% because of these fucking signs,

27:11.840 --> 27:12.880
but no, great, whatever.

27:13.680 --> 27:21.680
Office supplies. People give a lot of static to dot matrix printers, but one thing that you can

27:21.680 --> 27:26.800
say about them is that they did make it a lot easier to print out sick banners.

27:26.800 --> 27:28.720
They were just inherent banner makers.

27:28.720 --> 27:32.080
They were just like way better doing like sick fucking sick banners.

27:32.080 --> 27:33.040
Now, what am I going to do now?

27:33.040 --> 27:36.480
Staple it together, tape it together like some kind of monster.

27:36.480 --> 27:37.440
Yeah. Yeah.

27:37.440 --> 27:40.640
It's like, no, but like, those were like the banners and like,

27:40.640 --> 27:43.120
it's all about whether or not you took the dots off or not.

27:43.120 --> 27:44.640
That's how much you like the person.

27:44.640 --> 27:47.520
It's like, if you didn't care about it, if it was just Glenn's birthday,

27:47.520 --> 27:49.200
then you leave the dots on.

27:49.200 --> 27:51.600
But for Stephanie's birthday, yeah, take them off.

27:51.600 --> 27:53.520
And you might throw some clipboard on there.

27:53.520 --> 27:55.760
Maybe like throw a birthday cake on there.

27:55.760 --> 27:57.440
I'm, I have a better idea.

27:57.440 --> 28:00.640
And what if in addition to the happy birthday well wishes,

28:00.640 --> 28:04.160
you also printed on these banners and birthday signs,

28:04.160 --> 28:07.840
and fucking practical, useful business information.

28:07.840 --> 28:09.040
And then all of a sudden,

28:09.040 --> 28:13.360
these aren't just like little pieces of useless, messy decoration.

28:13.360 --> 28:15.440
You got a fucking Excel spreadsheet on there,

28:15.440 --> 28:19.360
showing you the dividends from today's profits.

28:19.360 --> 28:20.000
And then on another one-

28:20.000 --> 28:21.440
Wait, how did you do that?

28:21.440 --> 28:22.480
You looked into the future?

28:23.680 --> 28:24.160
Well, yesterday-

28:24.160 --> 28:26.160
You gotta do the dividends from yesterday's profits.

28:26.160 --> 28:28.160
This is my, this is, you've gotten ahead of me,

28:28.160 --> 28:30.160
but this is my remake of early edition.

28:30.160 --> 28:35.040
And it's called, it's called birthday business future, man.

28:35.040 --> 28:35.600
Maybe on TBS.

28:35.600 --> 28:36.480
But on the banner,

28:36.480 --> 28:38.560
it could have like everybody's schedules for the day.

28:38.560 --> 28:39.120
You know what I mean?

28:39.120 --> 28:40.320
Practical, useful information.

28:40.320 --> 28:42.000
Then maybe you won't feel like this is a mess.

28:42.000 --> 28:42.720
Bless this mess.

28:42.720 --> 28:46.960
It'd be like, this is a good, this is a useful mess.

28:46.960 --> 28:48.080
I got a pretty good scam.

28:48.800 --> 28:54.320
Why don't you, when you finally encounter these decorations,

28:55.040 --> 28:57.680
just start like sneezing and rubbing your eyes.

28:57.680 --> 29:00.240
And like, oh great, thanks guys.

29:00.240 --> 29:02.240
And act like you're allergic.

29:02.240 --> 29:02.880
To what?

29:02.880 --> 29:03.280
To what?

29:03.280 --> 29:04.160
To decorations?

29:04.160 --> 29:05.360
To decorations.

29:05.360 --> 29:08.480
And then when you pull them down, it's like, yeah.

29:08.480 --> 29:10.480
And you make such like a big deal about it

29:10.480 --> 29:12.240
that like when you finally do tear it down,

29:12.240 --> 29:13.040
they're relieved.

29:13.040 --> 29:15.120
Like, oh fuck, thank you God.

29:15.120 --> 29:16.480
But in order to continue selling it,

29:16.480 --> 29:19.040
like if they put up like fucking Christmas decorations,

29:19.040 --> 29:20.080
when you walk into the office,

29:20.080 --> 29:21.200
you just have to be like, hey guys,

29:21.200 --> 29:24.640
I was like, I'm gonna have to take the leak.

29:24.640 --> 29:25.760
Just start fucking convulsing.

29:25.760 --> 29:28.160
Like get the tree out of here.

29:28.160 --> 29:33.120
Maybe it's just birthday decorations you're allergic to.

29:33.920 --> 29:34.160
Okay.

29:34.160 --> 29:35.280
That's specific.

29:36.240 --> 29:37.440
It is a little specific.

29:37.440 --> 29:39.520
Here's, let me be even more specific, Travis.

29:40.560 --> 29:42.800
Let's go to the money zone.

29:42.800 --> 29:56.800
We mentioned MeUndies earlier, what is that?

29:56.800 --> 29:57.600
Do I have to do it?

29:57.600 --> 29:58.720
My throat hurts.

29:58.720 --> 29:59.680
Oh, I'll do it.

29:59.680 --> 30:02.160
Okay, Griffin, what is, why is MeUndies?

30:02.160 --> 30:03.920
Let me tell you what MeUndies is.

30:03.920 --> 30:04.160
Please.

30:04.160 --> 30:10.480
They are, you know, clouds in the sky?

30:10.480 --> 30:10.720
Yeah.

30:10.720 --> 30:14.000
Yeah, and how they look all puffy and comfortable

30:14.000 --> 30:16.160
and you just think like, God, I wish I was a giant man

30:16.720 --> 30:18.960
who could like clothe myself in those.

30:18.960 --> 30:19.520
Definitely.

30:20.240 --> 30:21.440
Or a giant woman.

30:21.440 --> 30:21.680
Yep.

30:22.720 --> 30:23.360
You know-

30:23.360 --> 30:24.480
You got me so far now.

30:24.480 --> 30:25.840
Imagine a giant woman.

30:25.840 --> 30:26.640
Uh-huh.

30:26.640 --> 30:27.440
Or a giant person.

30:27.440 --> 30:28.720
Can we just say giant person?

30:28.720 --> 30:31.440
Well, no, I'm a giant woman that is wearing clouds.

30:32.320 --> 30:35.120
But then she reaches down and picks me up and swallows me.

30:35.120 --> 30:36.080
Is she Kimmy Gibbler?

30:38.320 --> 30:38.960
I've gotta go.

30:38.960 --> 30:42.480
Okay, well, I'm gonna tell you about MeUndies.

30:42.480 --> 30:43.680
No, I'm gonna tell you about MeUndies

30:43.680 --> 30:44.480
because here's what's up.

30:45.120 --> 30:48.240
They are soft as clouds and twice as good looking,

30:48.880 --> 30:50.880
but they don't produce as much moisture, eh?

30:51.600 --> 30:53.440
See, I had a point to all this.

30:53.440 --> 30:56.640
They are, whether you're wearing a suit or sweats,

30:56.640 --> 30:58.320
you spend 24 hours a day in your underwear.

30:58.320 --> 31:00.320
Sometimes you wear them only when you're podcasting.

31:00.320 --> 31:03.120
Maybe you still are, despite the fact that you told your brothers

31:03.120 --> 31:04.320
you were gonna put pants back on.

31:04.880 --> 31:06.240
Maybe you sewed them to your chair

31:06.240 --> 31:09.120
so you just had to slip into them every time you sit down to work.

31:09.120 --> 31:09.760
That's great.

31:09.760 --> 31:10.880
Maybe they're part of the chair.

31:11.520 --> 31:14.400
MeUndies is the most comfortable way to wear underwear.

31:14.400 --> 31:16.400
They're made of a sustainably sourced modal,

31:16.400 --> 31:17.280
which is a fabric.

31:18.240 --> 31:19.440
Am I saying it right?

31:19.440 --> 31:21.600
They even pronounce a fucking pronunciation key here,

31:21.600 --> 31:22.480
but I'm having trouble reading the key.

31:22.480 --> 31:22.980
Motol!

31:24.400 --> 31:27.600
They're made of a sustainably sourced modoc,

31:27.600 --> 31:30.160
the killer human and living being,

31:31.280 --> 31:33.200
a fabric that is twice as soft as cotton.

31:33.200 --> 31:35.680
Nothing can describe the fit and feel of MeUndies,

31:35.680 --> 31:38.560
but MeUndies is dedicated to providing the world's most comfortable underwear.

31:38.560 --> 31:39.120
I love them.

31:39.120 --> 31:41.520
I have like almost a dozen pairs now.

31:41.520 --> 31:42.640
I wear them all the time.

31:42.640 --> 31:43.920
They're soft as hell.

31:43.920 --> 31:44.960
They feel super good.

31:45.840 --> 31:48.320
You can get free shipping in the US and Canada

31:48.320 --> 31:51.600
and save up to $8 a pair with the MeUndies subscription plan.

31:51.600 --> 31:52.480
Imagine the excitement.

31:52.480 --> 31:53.760
Go in your mailbox, you open it up,

31:53.760 --> 31:55.760
and you got fucking sexy, comfortable underwear in there.

31:55.760 --> 31:58.240
You put them on, you feel like a strong, confident man or woman.

31:58.240 --> 32:00.240
You feel like a strong, confident person.

32:00.240 --> 32:01.280
I love it.

32:01.280 --> 32:02.560
You can get a subscription or a single pair,

32:02.560 --> 32:04.000
and you get 20% off your first order

32:04.000 --> 32:06.240
if you go to MeUndies.com slash my brother.

32:06.240 --> 32:07.360
That's all one word.

32:07.360 --> 32:10.160
My brother for 20% off your first order.

32:10.160 --> 32:11.760
MeUndies.com slash my brother.

32:11.760 --> 32:12.480
Go to it.

32:12.480 --> 32:13.280
You'll get them.

32:13.280 --> 32:15.360
Gird your genitals with the best.

32:15.360 --> 32:16.960
With cloud fabric.

32:16.960 --> 32:18.720
I also want to tell you about NatureBox.

32:18.720 --> 32:20.240
Then we've talked about NatureBox before,

32:20.240 --> 32:21.440
but maybe you haven't tried it.

32:21.440 --> 32:22.720
If so, I'm sorry.

32:22.720 --> 32:24.640
Have we actually talked about NatureBox before?

32:25.520 --> 32:28.640
I think we might be the first podcast to ever mention NatureBox.

32:29.520 --> 32:31.600
Because I know we've talked about Crunchums2Go,

32:32.320 --> 32:33.680
which was the other platform.

32:33.680 --> 32:35.680
Crunchums2Go is that old shit, Griffin.

32:36.240 --> 32:36.720
Okay.

32:36.720 --> 32:37.600
Well, tell me about-

32:37.600 --> 32:38.960
It's 2016.

32:38.960 --> 32:40.560
Tell me about this hip new competitor.

32:40.560 --> 32:42.400
Well, NatureBox is new on the scene,

32:42.400 --> 32:46.240
but basically how it works is you get a box of snacks,

32:47.120 --> 32:50.400
and you get to choose from over 100 tasty options

32:50.400 --> 32:54.480
like sriracha roasted cashews and French toast granola,

32:54.480 --> 32:56.960
or you can fill out your snack profile

32:56.960 --> 32:59.920
and then get like surprise things based on your preferences.

32:59.920 --> 33:00.480
I just got some-

33:00.480 --> 33:03.280
This actually sounds like yum yum fun pouches.

33:03.280 --> 33:07.920
No, yum yum fun pouches is full of MSG and arsenic.

33:07.920 --> 33:08.880
And MGS.

33:08.880 --> 33:09.840
And MGS.

33:09.840 --> 33:11.440
It's full of Metal Gear Solid discs.

33:12.000 --> 33:12.880
It's all broken up.

33:12.880 --> 33:13.360
I hate it.

33:14.400 --> 33:19.200
But NatureBox, it's full of good stuff that you'll like.

33:19.200 --> 33:19.920
Right, okay.

33:19.920 --> 33:22.480
Yeah, like I don't want to oversell it,

33:22.480 --> 33:25.040
but it's full of good stuff that you'll like.

33:25.040 --> 33:25.520
Like what?

33:25.520 --> 33:26.960
Tell me what kind of snacks I can get.

33:26.960 --> 33:29.120
Well, I just got some mini Belgium waffles.

33:29.120 --> 33:30.960
I got some guacamole bites.

33:30.960 --> 33:31.920
What are those?

33:31.920 --> 33:33.600
Guacamole bites, they were like corn chip,

33:33.600 --> 33:35.680
but like guacamole flavored and amazing.

33:35.680 --> 33:37.680
Threw some in a tomato soup.

33:37.680 --> 33:38.640
It was incredible.

33:39.520 --> 33:41.520
Yeah, that's what's great about them

33:41.520 --> 33:44.320
is because they're not full of all of that bad stuff

33:44.320 --> 33:45.440
that's bad for you,

33:45.440 --> 33:47.680
you can eat them and still feel good about yourself.

33:47.680 --> 33:52.640
Guaranteed no broken up PlayStation discs

33:52.640 --> 33:53.520
in these pouches.

33:53.520 --> 33:55.360
That's the NatureBox guarantee.

33:55.360 --> 33:57.280
And they're constantly coming up with new recipes

33:57.280 --> 33:58.400
and new snacks to try.

33:58.400 --> 33:59.840
So you're never going to get bored.

33:59.840 --> 34:03.280
So go to naturebox.com right now.

34:04.000 --> 34:07.200
Like why are you even waiting, you dumbo?

34:07.200 --> 34:10.400
Go right now and unbox a world of taste and possibility.

34:10.400 --> 34:11.920
Salt and pepper lentil loops.

34:11.920 --> 34:13.360
Yeah, incredible.

34:14.240 --> 34:14.800
They're the best.

34:14.800 --> 34:15.520
They're my favorite.

34:15.520 --> 34:18.560
Like if you like good things.

34:18.560 --> 34:20.800
I really like their holy chalupas

34:21.440 --> 34:23.520
and it's just a full fucking chalupa

34:23.520 --> 34:25.280
that they send it to you in a bag.

34:25.280 --> 34:28.240
But you eat and it cures you of all your sins.

34:28.240 --> 34:30.320
No, it's literally been sanctified

34:30.320 --> 34:31.120
and they just send it to you

34:31.120 --> 34:33.120
in a big old plastic grocery bag.

34:33.120 --> 34:34.640
It's a papal chalupa.

34:34.640 --> 34:37.680
Just a big garbage bag full of chalupas.

34:37.680 --> 34:39.520
Just a loose chalupa.

34:39.520 --> 34:42.240
A big garbage bag full of loose chalupas.

34:42.240 --> 34:44.640
These are all yesterday's chalupas that didn't sell.

34:45.200 --> 34:47.520
That's actually the other subscription service

34:47.520 --> 34:48.640
yesterday's chalupas,

34:48.640 --> 34:52.800
which we don't do that one anymore for obvious reasons

34:54.000 --> 34:55.760
because they stopped paying us.

34:55.760 --> 34:58.960
We also have a message for Sean from Jess.

34:59.680 --> 35:02.240
Happy belated birthday, my dearest fella.

35:02.240 --> 35:04.240
I wanted to do something unique this year

35:04.240 --> 35:05.920
as a thank you for being such a loving

35:05.920 --> 35:07.360
and supportive boyfriend.

35:07.360 --> 35:08.880
So I thought getting the brothers,

35:08.880 --> 35:10.080
especially your fave one.

35:10.080 --> 35:11.760
Oh, Griff, okay.

35:11.760 --> 35:12.960
To wish you a good one.

35:14.400 --> 35:15.120
Eat my butt.

35:15.120 --> 35:17.120
Hey Travis, hey Justin, eat my butt.

35:17.120 --> 35:18.160
Crotch chop, crotch.

35:18.160 --> 35:19.040
I'm doing the crotch chop.

35:19.040 --> 35:19.920
I knew you couldn't hear it.

35:19.920 --> 35:20.960
Well, let me try it.

35:20.960 --> 35:22.080
Hey, hey, stop, wait, shut up.

35:22.080 --> 35:22.640
Wait, stop.

35:22.640 --> 35:27.760
Tell me if you can hear me doing a crotch chop.

35:27.760 --> 35:28.800
Could you tell what that was?

35:29.600 --> 35:29.920
No.

35:29.920 --> 35:32.080
I think it sounded like a crotch chop to me.

35:32.080 --> 35:33.600
Here's to many more together.

35:33.600 --> 35:35.120
Love you so much.

35:36.160 --> 35:36.560
Yeah.

35:37.200 --> 35:39.120
Sorry you had to listen to me do it.

35:40.240 --> 35:42.240
You're golden child Griffin.

35:42.240 --> 35:43.360
Good, yeah.

35:45.600 --> 35:47.280
I'm gonna go, I'm gonna slay my beer.

35:47.280 --> 35:47.780
Yeah.

35:48.560 --> 35:51.040
This next message is very confusing.

35:51.040 --> 35:54.240
Yeah, I don't know, this is our dad, right?

35:54.240 --> 35:56.480
No, I think this is a different person.

35:56.480 --> 36:00.560
It's from, it's for Poppy and CJ McElroy.

36:01.200 --> 36:04.000
And it's from Cliff and Caitlin McElroy.

36:04.000 --> 36:05.360
Hold the fucking phone.

36:05.920 --> 36:06.420
I know.

36:07.920 --> 36:09.920
Is this an AR, is this an ARG?

36:09.920 --> 36:11.040
What the fuck?

36:11.040 --> 36:13.280
It's an ARG, we're being activated.

36:13.280 --> 36:16.720
It says, happy second birthday you cool former babies.

36:17.280 --> 36:19.840
Your second year has been an adventure,

36:19.840 --> 36:21.280
just like your first and still,

36:21.280 --> 36:23.520
everyone who meets you falls in love.

36:23.520 --> 36:25.120
You learned to walk and talk,

36:25.120 --> 36:27.040
conquered your third continent,

36:27.040 --> 36:28.720
and moved around the world.

36:28.720 --> 36:31.040
Not too shabby for just one year.

36:31.040 --> 36:33.280
Here's to another great year kiddos.

36:33.280 --> 36:34.400
We love you.

36:34.400 --> 36:34.900
What?

36:35.760 --> 36:38.960
Is this for babies or is this all like coded language?

36:39.760 --> 36:41.520
It's one of the two.

36:41.520 --> 36:43.040
Do they let their, okay.

36:44.400 --> 36:46.000
One, are your babies listening?

36:46.000 --> 36:48.320
Two, do you know that's our last name?

36:48.320 --> 36:50.160
Where do you think you're going?

36:50.160 --> 36:53.200
Three, is this your backdoor pitch for babies year out,

36:53.200 --> 36:54.640
the sequel to babies day out?

36:55.280 --> 36:58.400
Three, our dad is a grandfather

36:58.400 --> 37:02.160
and one of his granddaughters calls him Poppy.

37:02.160 --> 37:04.640
So this is like even more confusing.

37:04.640 --> 37:07.680
Also Poppy is not strikingly a child's name

37:07.680 --> 37:09.360
unless it's Poppy like the flower

37:09.360 --> 37:10.880
instead of Poppy like the nickname.

37:11.440 --> 37:13.040
I think that's what we're dealing with here.

37:13.040 --> 37:14.800
And Travis, just so I'm clear,

37:16.160 --> 37:17.280
child's names.

37:17.280 --> 37:20.160
So basically the idea what this is,

37:21.040 --> 37:22.800
and this is my new idea,

37:22.800 --> 37:24.480
is that you have a child's name

37:24.480 --> 37:27.280
and then maybe when he gets older you get a different one.

37:27.280 --> 37:30.480
Well, have you ever been like my two names to grandpa?

37:30.480 --> 37:31.680
He's two years old.

37:32.400 --> 37:34.240
Please kickstart my new deal.

37:34.240 --> 37:35.840
It's two names for everybody.

37:36.560 --> 37:39.040
Yeah, you do that where you're like you're Benny

37:39.040 --> 37:40.880
and then you're Bernard when you're an adult,

37:40.880 --> 37:42.720
but then you're Benny again when you're an old man.

37:42.720 --> 37:43.920
No, that's close by to Travis.

37:43.920 --> 37:46.400
I'm saying like, I didn't pick this fucking name.

37:46.400 --> 37:48.240
I didn't pick this fucking name.

37:48.240 --> 37:50.080
And I have to go through life with this fucking name?

37:51.040 --> 37:52.720
Like obviously you can change your name, whatever.

37:52.720 --> 37:55.200
I'm saying it should be like custom.

37:55.200 --> 37:57.360
Well, not mandatory, but like customary.

37:58.560 --> 37:59.680
You know what I mean?

37:59.680 --> 38:00.960
At what age are you responding?

38:00.960 --> 38:02.080
Cause it's not like 10.

38:02.080 --> 38:04.400
If it was 10, everybody wouldn't be named like Thunder.

38:04.400 --> 38:05.440
Oh, let's do it at 20.

38:05.440 --> 38:07.200
Cause 20 is like a nothing birthday.

38:07.200 --> 38:08.160
Nothing happens at 20.

38:08.160 --> 38:09.760
You're just like waiting for that sweet, sweet,

38:09.760 --> 38:12.000
you know, booze taste to come in a year.

38:12.000 --> 38:13.280
I think at 20 you get to pick your own name

38:13.280 --> 38:15.040
and then you have something to look forward to.

38:15.040 --> 38:16.880
But then again, actually you're a what?

38:16.880 --> 38:18.240
A junior in college at that point.

38:18.240 --> 38:19.920
That might not be the time to be making

38:19.920 --> 38:21.120
a permanent decision like that.

38:24.160 --> 38:28.000
Why don't zero to two, it's just a number, okay?

38:29.120 --> 38:31.280
Well, can I actually zero to two?

38:31.280 --> 38:35.280
Well, it should be a word describing your baby form.

38:35.280 --> 38:36.960
So something like precious.

38:36.960 --> 38:40.480
How about like your baby form plus the day you were born.

38:41.440 --> 38:42.800
So like the day of the week.

38:42.800 --> 38:44.640
Sweet pea, October 3rd.

38:44.640 --> 38:45.280
Yeah.

38:45.280 --> 38:45.600
Okay.

38:45.600 --> 38:46.320
So you got that.

38:46.320 --> 38:49.600
And then at two, you get to pick a funny name

38:49.600 --> 38:51.760
cause I think that would be really funny to like,

38:52.560 --> 38:54.320
like my daughter would be named

38:54.320 --> 38:56.800
like happy snowman from frozen McElroy.

38:57.360 --> 39:00.880
Like that would be her or like probably mommy McElroy.

39:00.880 --> 39:02.160
If I finally had to let her pick.

39:02.160 --> 39:03.360
That would get confusing though.

39:03.360 --> 39:04.640
That would be very confusing.

39:04.640 --> 39:04.880
Yes.

39:05.840 --> 39:08.320
You say mommy and then Sydney comes in and you're like,

39:08.320 --> 39:10.640
no, sorry, I meant the other mommy.

39:10.640 --> 39:11.520
The other mommy.

39:11.520 --> 39:11.760
Yeah.

39:11.760 --> 39:14.800
No, I'm sorry, I was singing along with the song.

39:14.800 --> 39:15.360
Hey mommy.

39:15.920 --> 39:18.240
And you, I can understand how this is confusing.

39:18.240 --> 39:21.360
But if we, if we let her name herself now

39:21.360 --> 39:23.120
by the things she's obsessed with today,

39:23.680 --> 39:27.280
she would either name herself Pikachu videos

39:27.280 --> 39:28.640
or things I bought at Sheets

39:28.640 --> 39:30.560
cause that's where she's at right now.

39:30.560 --> 39:32.240
She's a big fan of things I bought at Sheets, huh?

39:32.240 --> 39:32.400
Yeah.

39:32.400 --> 39:34.000
It's a confusing time in her life.

39:34.960 --> 39:37.280
She down with that Pikachu though.

39:37.280 --> 39:38.240
She knows what's up.

39:38.240 --> 39:42.080
She does love videos of adults in Pikachu costumes.

39:42.080 --> 39:44.160
That's not what I thought it would be.

39:44.160 --> 39:46.320
No, that's not where the zeitgeist began.

39:46.880 --> 39:49.520
Sydney said she loves videos.

39:49.520 --> 39:52.560
She, she keeps harping on the fact that she loves videos

39:52.560 --> 39:55.520
of adults wearing Pikachu costumes in public.

39:55.520 --> 39:56.000
That is it.

39:56.000 --> 39:57.920
I said, sweetheart, you keep highlighting the fact

39:57.920 --> 40:00.160
that they're adults in Pikachu costumes

40:00.160 --> 40:03.760
as if it would be in any way humane

40:03.760 --> 40:08.320
or even possible to put children into Pikachu costumes

40:08.320 --> 40:12.000
and not expect them to get like horrid heatstroke

40:12.000 --> 40:13.760
or like blackout instantly.

40:13.760 --> 40:16.240
That is a poor way to onboard somebody

40:16.240 --> 40:18.640
to this beloved franchise though, Justin.

40:18.640 --> 40:19.760
You're just gonna confuse her

40:19.760 --> 40:21.600
cause she's not learning the fucking essentials.

40:21.600 --> 40:24.240
She's not learning that this thing evolves from Pichu

40:24.240 --> 40:26.240
and when you use the Thunderstone turns into Raichu

40:26.240 --> 40:28.640
but hold up on that cause Pikachu learns better moves.

40:28.640 --> 40:29.120
You know what I mean?

40:29.120 --> 40:33.200
Like you start with the, I mean, ideally you start with the games

40:33.200 --> 40:34.240
and then you move on to the anime

40:34.240 --> 40:35.840
cause even the anime has some,

40:35.840 --> 40:38.480
let's just say loose interpretations of the game mechanics.

40:38.480 --> 40:40.400
And also some pretty adult themes.

40:40.400 --> 40:42.320
Also some adult themes.

40:42.320 --> 40:44.800
Her favorite video that Sydney showed her

40:44.800 --> 40:50.320
is the like climactic scene from Pokemon, the Pokemon movie.

40:50.320 --> 40:52.400
Where Pikachu, where Ash dies.

40:52.400 --> 40:53.200
Spoilers!

40:53.200 --> 40:56.240
Dies and Pikachu brings her back to life

40:56.240 --> 40:59.040
and Sydney's just showing her this like, isn't this cute?

40:59.040 --> 41:01.600
I'm like, this is a fucking whole arc.

41:01.600 --> 41:02.880
There's a whole film.

41:02.880 --> 41:05.280
She doesn't understand the implications.

41:05.920 --> 41:09.040
She cannot even appreciate the bond

41:09.040 --> 41:11.040
that's been established the rest of the film.

41:11.040 --> 41:14.160
When those sad Pikachu's are just slapping the shit out of each other.

41:14.160 --> 41:15.520
Oh, and just crying.

41:15.520 --> 41:18.640
It would be like if you showed the one scene in Godfather

41:19.200 --> 41:22.640
where Marlon Brando puts a orange slice in his mouth

41:22.640 --> 41:24.480
that has a heart attack to a child.

41:24.480 --> 41:26.080
Like this is Godfather.

41:26.080 --> 41:27.440
Like you can't have any,

41:27.440 --> 41:30.080
it's just a sad old man with an orange in his mouth.

41:30.080 --> 41:31.440
She can't appreciate that.

41:31.440 --> 41:34.320
This is my daughter dead old Marlon Brando.

41:37.120 --> 41:38.880
She picked it, I don't know.

41:38.880 --> 41:42.000
She's got another 18 years before she can change it again.

41:42.000 --> 41:43.040
Hi, I'm Brian Safi.

41:43.040 --> 41:43.840
And I'm Erin Gibson.

41:43.840 --> 41:46.080
And we host the Throwing Shade podcast.

41:46.080 --> 41:48.320
On Throwing Shade, we look at an issue important to ladies

41:48.320 --> 41:49.920
and an issue important to gay people.

41:49.920 --> 41:51.360
And then we basically make fun of it.

41:51.360 --> 41:53.120
Yeah, and just to answer your question,

41:53.120 --> 41:54.480
no, we don't have a marriage pact.

41:54.480 --> 41:56.960
But if we don't get married by the time we're 30,

41:56.960 --> 41:57.840
we're gonna do that for each other.

41:57.840 --> 41:58.720
No, that's true.

41:58.720 --> 42:04.240
Although we have each been divorced three times.

42:04.240 --> 42:06.080
This Yahoo was sent in by Eric Rudkin.

42:06.080 --> 42:06.800
Thank you, Eric.

42:06.800 --> 42:09.600
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Janet, who asks,

42:11.680 --> 42:14.400
I got kicked out of a CC's pizza for eating too much.

42:15.520 --> 42:16.240
Bullshit.

42:16.240 --> 42:17.120
There's a question mark.

42:17.120 --> 42:19.120
I got kicked out of a CC's pizza for eating too much.

42:19.760 --> 42:21.840
I'm currently a 17 year old male.

42:21.840 --> 42:24.320
And I'm 5'11 and 125 pounds.

42:24.320 --> 42:25.280
Holy shit.

42:25.280 --> 42:27.680
And my doctor recommended that I literally,

42:27.680 --> 42:30.960
quote unquote, go all out and eat a bunch of food.

42:31.520 --> 42:37.520
Because my BMI, my BMI, just go fucking hog wild.

42:37.520 --> 42:39.360
Just fucking let loose.

42:39.360 --> 42:42.480
Just dive into Scylla's lasagna and get deep in the pain.

42:42.480 --> 42:44.160
You've been too restrained.

42:44.160 --> 42:47.360
Listen, I've been telling you this for years, J-Dog.

42:47.360 --> 42:48.720
You been holding back.

42:49.360 --> 42:52.640
Go to that CC's and fucking slam some za.

42:52.640 --> 42:54.160
Fire up that pain train.

42:54.160 --> 43:01.120
Now take some of these xannies and get out there and go fucking hog wild.

43:01.120 --> 43:04.320
Do a couple of fucking whippets and go eat some za.

43:04.320 --> 43:07.200
Take these pergocets and go crazy.

43:07.200 --> 43:12.160
Go to the fucking golden corral and bring a fucking sleeping bag.

43:12.160 --> 43:14.000
Don't leave till they kick you out.

43:14.000 --> 43:16.480
I'm a 17 year old male, 5'11, 125 pounds.

43:16.480 --> 43:21.120
My doctor told me to go fucking hog wild and eat a bunch of food

43:21.120 --> 43:22.960
because my BMI is frighteningly low.

43:22.960 --> 43:26.640
I decided to go to the local CC's Pizza because they offer an all-you-can-eat buffet.

43:26.640 --> 43:30.880
I stayed for around 45 minutes, around 4.15 to 5 o'clock p.m.

43:30.880 --> 43:34.000
and ate 22 slices of pizza.

43:34.000 --> 43:37.120
Now we're talking about CC slices, which are not gigantic.

43:37.120 --> 43:39.760
That's also not the, like, that's high.

43:39.760 --> 43:40.800
Don't get me wrong.

43:40.800 --> 43:41.600
Wait, hold on.

43:42.240 --> 43:43.360
What are you about to say?

43:43.360 --> 43:43.920
No, no, no.

43:43.920 --> 43:47.360
If the premise of this, my point was going to be,

43:47.360 --> 43:51.680
if the premise of this is that CC's would kick him out for eating too much,

43:51.680 --> 43:56.160
I do not believe that 22 slices is the most someone has ever eaten at CC's.

43:56.720 --> 43:58.160
That's a fair point that Travis is making,

43:58.160 --> 44:01.440
but what if he only got one slice at a time?

44:01.440 --> 44:03.120
First off, very annoying.

44:03.120 --> 44:05.040
And secondly, as he ate every one, he went,

44:06.800 --> 44:08.240
yummy, yummy, yummy.

44:08.240 --> 44:08.480
One?

44:08.480 --> 44:10.880
I'm very much liking this pizza.

44:10.880 --> 44:11.520
Very good.

44:12.160 --> 44:13.520
Yummy, yummy, yummy.

44:13.520 --> 44:14.640
Like with every slice.

44:15.440 --> 44:15.940
Yeah.

44:16.400 --> 44:21.200
Travis, I just want to congratulate you on being very cautious with your wording

44:21.200 --> 44:23.760
and not saying what your mind and your heart thought,

44:23.760 --> 44:26.160
which is, I don't think that's that much pizza.

44:27.360 --> 44:29.600
I mean, but it's just, okay.

44:29.600 --> 44:33.360
One, I'm not saying I could or would eat 22 slices of pizza.

44:33.360 --> 44:37.680
I'm an adult, but I'm saying that when you propose,

44:37.680 --> 44:39.920
I'm about to say an astronomically high number

44:39.920 --> 44:41.840
that would get someone kicked out of CC's.

44:41.840 --> 44:46.720
I mean, granted, that's like two slices or it's a slice every two minutes.

44:47.280 --> 44:48.160
We're going to have 45.

44:48.160 --> 44:49.200
Yeah, that's okay.

44:49.200 --> 44:51.920
Yes, when you put it that way, Travis, for 22.

44:52.800 --> 44:54.640
No, no, no.

44:54.640 --> 44:56.080
That's a lot of fucking pizza.

44:56.080 --> 44:58.960
That sounds like fucking no face from Spirited Away,

44:58.960 --> 45:03.280
just like shoveling like a whole carton of za into his fucking face

45:03.280 --> 45:07.120
and like barfing up gold to lure the CC's pizza employees nearby.

45:07.120 --> 45:08.080
Just demanding they,

45:08.800 --> 45:11.200
he's not going to stop eating until they bring sin out to him.

45:11.200 --> 45:12.160
Yeah, fuck.

45:12.160 --> 45:14.080
Like that's a lot of za, my dude.

45:14.080 --> 45:16.400
That's a shit ton of sweet pie.

45:16.400 --> 45:19.440
I'm, I guess I wasn't thinking of the timeframe.

45:19.440 --> 45:21.920
Did they kick him out because they were worried about him?

45:21.920 --> 45:24.480
Like, listen, this isn't about the amount of pizza, J-Dog.

45:24.480 --> 45:25.280
You got to go.

45:25.280 --> 45:27.760
Like, I don't know what dog here told you to do this, but-

45:28.560 --> 45:30.400
I think they kicked him out because he ate,

45:30.400 --> 45:33.840
this person ate Dave while they were like bussing a table.

45:35.280 --> 45:36.640
You slimer Dave.

45:38.080 --> 45:40.480
As I was about to, I haven't even finished the fucking question.

45:40.480 --> 45:43.280
I was about to finish some pineapple ham pizza that they just set out.

45:43.280 --> 45:44.240
Okay, again.

45:45.120 --> 45:45.920
Hey, careful.

45:45.920 --> 45:46.800
God, he got a finger.

45:48.000 --> 45:49.520
That was just pineapple pizza.

45:50.080 --> 45:52.320
The manager ran up to me and ran up to me.

45:53.360 --> 45:54.960
You got to get the fuck out of here, man.

45:58.080 --> 46:01.440
That I had exceeded the max amount that you can eat at the buffet.

46:01.440 --> 46:02.240
What the hell?

46:02.240 --> 46:04.400
It's literally called an all you can eat buffet.

46:04.400 --> 46:06.160
I've heard of no such thing in my life.

46:06.160 --> 46:09.040
Maybe they shouldn't charge such a low price if they're going to get pissed off.

46:09.040 --> 46:11.840
Has anyone experienced something similar or should I make a complaint?

46:11.840 --> 46:12.640
Thanks.

46:12.640 --> 46:18.000
Fucking, let's kick things off with this divisive answer from anonymous who said,

46:18.000 --> 46:20.160
yes, you can get kicked out because you took advantage.

46:20.160 --> 46:22.240
You should only be allowed to eat for 30 minutes.

46:22.240 --> 46:25.280
Plus, if it was a busy day, they might feel you stayed too long and need the table.

46:26.080 --> 46:26.720
What?

46:26.720 --> 46:27.440
No, hold on.

46:28.240 --> 46:32.080
No CeCe's has ever been like, hey man, we need that four top back.

46:32.080 --> 46:33.760
We need that four top back.

46:33.760 --> 46:38.240
Listen, we got a reservation for CeCe's pizza.

46:39.600 --> 46:41.280
The president might stop by.

46:41.280 --> 46:43.360
We need to keep that corner booth clear.

46:43.360 --> 46:44.480
That's false advertising.

46:44.480 --> 46:45.600
It's a pretty easy lawsuit.

46:45.600 --> 46:46.320
My client.

46:49.520 --> 46:54.480
What I intend to show by the end of the day is that he had not eaten all he could.

46:55.360 --> 46:58.000
Watch this motherfucker eat 23 slices of pizza.

46:58.000 --> 46:59.840
And then it's all of a sudden it's that scene from Matilda.

47:02.800 --> 47:03.840
Oh my Jesus.

47:05.440 --> 47:07.760
It all stems back to the terrible doctor.

47:08.800 --> 47:09.200
Sue them.

47:09.200 --> 47:13.120
It happened, I'm just going down these comments because this is fucking banana cake.

47:14.720 --> 47:15.200
Sue them.

47:15.200 --> 47:19.520
It happened to this one guy I knew who loved going to all you can eat buffets.

47:19.520 --> 47:21.600
One time he got kicked out for eating too much and sued them.

47:21.600 --> 47:24.960
He received over 50,000 American dollars because of it.

47:25.680 --> 47:29.200
As for you, I would contact the corporation online or report to them what happened.

47:29.200 --> 47:31.840
They will most likely give you a discount coupons the next time you go.

47:31.840 --> 47:32.720
What's up motherfuckers?

47:32.720 --> 47:35.520
You need a discount coupon to go to the CeCe's?

47:35.520 --> 47:36.560
What's up motherfuckers?

47:36.560 --> 47:40.240
I'm back and this time I'm not paying my six dollars.

47:40.240 --> 47:42.640
My, listen, no, you should sue them.

47:42.640 --> 47:51.760
My friend Fat Dead Greg would sue them for his overeating there at CeCe's and he got a great deal.

47:52.320 --> 47:53.200
Great deal out of it.

47:53.200 --> 47:56.000
You have a much better case against the doctor.

47:56.000 --> 48:00.560
I remember, I don't remember much from the episodes of Man vs Food I've watched.

48:00.560 --> 48:02.400
Because I find it distasteful.

48:02.400 --> 48:07.040
But I do remember an episode where he's like, this episode I'm gonna try to eat a 10 pound pizza.

48:07.040 --> 48:10.080
And I'm gonna be like, Adam, Adam, Adam.

48:10.080 --> 48:11.920
No one's making you do this, Adam.

48:11.920 --> 48:12.800
You don't, Adam, listen.

48:12.800 --> 48:14.160
Everybody said I couldn't do it.

48:14.160 --> 48:16.560
Nobody, Adam, they said you shouldn't do that.

48:16.560 --> 48:18.400
When you were like, I'm gonna eat 100 oysters.

48:18.400 --> 48:22.800
I was like, that seems like a bad way to eat oysters, Adam, but you do you, I think you go for it.

48:22.800 --> 48:26.480
But Adam, understand, please, it's 10 pounds of material.

48:26.480 --> 48:28.960
You can't, you just can't do this.

48:28.960 --> 48:32.560
Alexa warns, don't overeat pizza, it will catch up to you.

48:32.560 --> 48:38.960
Oompa loompa, doompa dee doo, 20 suit slices will kill you.

48:38.960 --> 48:42.240
How is the response to Alexa's comment, not Janet going?

48:42.240 --> 48:46.960
That's not the fucking question, Janet or Alexa, whoever we're talking about.

48:46.960 --> 48:52.640
I wanna, I don't understand how this question asker had such a low BMI.

48:52.640 --> 48:56.400
And then this doctor like awakened the animal within.

48:56.400 --> 49:01.440
And all of a sudden they go from like zero to 22, right?

49:01.440 --> 49:04.640
Like they're just like found something deep inside of them.

49:04.640 --> 49:06.080
Like found their calling or something.

49:06.080 --> 49:12.160
The CC's pizza in Barbersville at the mall closed.

49:13.280 --> 49:20.400
The CC's all you can eat pizza in the city so fat that Jamie Oliver

49:21.040 --> 49:24.400
came to make a TV show to beg them to stop eating so much.

49:24.400 --> 49:28.080
There's a CC's pizza there and it closed down.

49:28.080 --> 49:34.000
His show, please salad, please salad, exasperatingly.

49:34.000 --> 49:38.240
This is a town that plays host to an annual hot dog festival,

49:38.880 --> 49:45.680
beer festival, chili fest, rib fest, and probably some other one.

49:45.680 --> 49:46.560
There's the pumpkin.

49:47.200 --> 49:47.840
Pumpkin festival.

49:47.840 --> 49:52.960
Well, but that's not just unhinging our jaws and eating pumpkins whole.

49:52.960 --> 49:55.280
It's mostly just worshiping the pumpkin.

49:55.280 --> 49:58.000
There's a lot of pumpkin consumption that happens.

49:58.000 --> 49:59.520
Let's not get it twisted.

49:59.520 --> 50:01.760
We're celebrating the pumpkin harvest.

50:02.720 --> 50:05.360
So that the gods continue to be gracious.

50:05.360 --> 50:09.600
This is the town where CC's couldn't keep the doors open.

50:09.600 --> 50:14.240
It was, as you've almost certainly guessed, replaced by a Christian bookstore.

50:15.280 --> 50:16.800
The natural successor.

50:16.800 --> 50:18.640
The natural successor to that.

50:18.640 --> 50:23.840
Yeah, it's when you turn your life away for your life of eating pizza all the time.

50:23.840 --> 50:26.960
How much do you guys think you could eat in 45 minutes?

50:26.960 --> 50:28.480
In terms of like pizzas?

50:28.480 --> 50:28.880
Yeah.

50:28.880 --> 50:29.600
Well, no, yeah.

50:29.600 --> 50:31.200
Not just like sheer poundage.

50:31.200 --> 50:38.960
The secret is to know when to flip the switch to dessert pizzas.

50:39.840 --> 50:44.880
Because, and if that counts, because you could eat

50:44.880 --> 50:49.680
all the pizza in Pizza Hut, okay?

50:51.120 --> 50:52.000
All of it.

50:52.000 --> 50:55.440
And then if someone brought out a cinnamon pizza, you'd be like, I don't know.

50:55.440 --> 50:55.840
Maybe.

50:56.400 --> 50:56.960
Let me see.

50:56.960 --> 50:58.640
Maybe, let me check that out.

50:58.640 --> 51:02.160
My, our local Pizza Hut, you know, they got on their buffet that I

51:02.720 --> 51:05.200
always used to really get a kick out of, pudding.

51:06.480 --> 51:07.760
Just a container of pudding.

51:08.480 --> 51:13.200
You could just get like three slizzies and one scoopa.

51:13.200 --> 51:17.920
And they, and I think it's a really good way to keep it balanced, you know?

51:17.920 --> 51:21.120
Because if you have the scoopa there with the slizzies.

51:21.120 --> 51:24.800
Well, if you have the slizzies and you send them down with a scoopa,

51:24.800 --> 51:27.440
that's going to keep everything moving real good down there.

51:27.440 --> 51:29.120
Justin, I would like to thank you.

51:29.120 --> 51:32.400
I don't, I don't know why I started talking like a tertiary character

51:32.400 --> 51:35.200
from an Indiana Jones movie, but I'm just going to keep that.

51:35.200 --> 51:39.360
I want to say a sincere thank you because honestly, God, never before this moment has

51:39.360 --> 51:43.520
it struck me how crazy it is that most salad bars that I grew up going to,

51:43.520 --> 51:48.320
or like that I've been to in my life, also just had a big fat of pudding.

51:48.320 --> 51:50.160
Okay, but I think Justin's cracked it.

51:50.160 --> 51:57.040
And that pudding is just like a sort of material sludge that you put in-

51:57.040 --> 51:59.520
Like a silicon kind of-

51:59.520 --> 51:59.920
Yeah.

51:59.920 --> 52:03.760
You put it in your, you put it in your body as if to tell your intestine like,

52:03.760 --> 52:05.600
let's get this thing going.

52:05.600 --> 52:06.560
It's just a scoopa.

52:06.560 --> 52:13.440
Hey, if you've ever gotten a scoopa and thought it was pudding,

52:13.440 --> 52:16.960
but also, but really it was salad dressing-

52:16.960 --> 52:18.400
Or butter.

52:18.400 --> 52:20.240
Then retweet this.

52:20.240 --> 52:32.720
Wait, okay, if the dressing consistency even vaguely resembles that of a scoopa,

52:33.280 --> 52:36.240
then it's the fucking restaurant's fault, I would say.

52:36.240 --> 52:36.640
Okay.

52:36.640 --> 52:38.960
Hey, listen, are you retweeting or not?

52:38.960 --> 52:40.320
I'm a busy man.

52:40.320 --> 52:42.080
He makes an excellent point, Griffin.

52:42.080 --> 52:42.480
Choose.

52:44.000 --> 52:46.320
I'm faving it, which means-

52:47.280 --> 52:48.720
Hey, listen, guys, listen.

52:48.720 --> 52:49.200
Oh, okay.

52:49.200 --> 52:51.040
About 20 minutes, I took some dayquil.

52:51.040 --> 52:54.720
So like things are gonna start getting a little loose from here on out.

52:54.720 --> 52:55.680
Oh, should we keep going?

52:56.400 --> 52:57.920
There's a man who can't hold his dayquil.

52:57.920 --> 52:59.200
I have another question for you.

52:59.200 --> 53:02.080
I wanna bounce this Yahoo off because I think it'll be really good.

53:02.080 --> 53:03.920
I feel like Travis, you're really gonna enjoy it.

53:03.920 --> 53:04.160
Okay.

53:04.160 --> 53:06.800
Okay, well, I'm sold.

53:06.800 --> 53:08.960
This Yahoo was sent in by Courtney Bergman.

53:08.960 --> 53:09.520
Thank you, Courtney.

53:09.520 --> 53:11.840
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Lady Ellie, who asks,

53:13.360 --> 53:16.160
the swing era is slowly dying away?

53:18.000 --> 53:19.440
What's the date on this question?

53:23.040 --> 53:24.160
Well, let's not worry about it.

53:26.800 --> 53:30.960
Let's make believe that it was asked today and not nine years ago.

53:31.840 --> 53:32.880
Okay, okay.

53:32.880 --> 53:35.280
You don't, a little less funny, I think.

53:35.280 --> 53:36.400
A little more tragic.

53:37.040 --> 53:38.880
You don't hear many swing dances anymore.

53:38.880 --> 53:40.240
I mean, you do hear of one.

53:40.240 --> 53:43.040
Only senior citizens and a few younger people go.

53:43.040 --> 53:45.200
The only ones that really dance are the senior citizens

53:45.200 --> 53:47.120
and the younger people don't really try.

53:47.120 --> 53:49.360
It is obvious that the swing era is dying away.

53:49.360 --> 53:50.400
But my real question is,

53:50.400 --> 53:53.840
is anybody in more recent generations going to miss the swing era?

53:53.840 --> 53:57.920
Does anyone appreciate Ya's music and the swing era enough

53:57.920 --> 54:02.880
to want to learn more about it and to try and keep it alive?

54:02.880 --> 54:04.240
Oh my Jesus.

54:04.240 --> 54:04.880
Do you remember?

54:05.680 --> 54:09.360
Do you guys remember that period where like Brian Setzer

54:09.360 --> 54:12.400
and like Trey Pop and Daddies and Squirrel Nut Zippers-

54:12.400 --> 54:14.320
All died in a single plane crash?

54:14.320 --> 54:16.000
Yeah, it was fucking horrible.

54:16.000 --> 54:17.760
And it was the day the swinging swung,

54:18.320 --> 54:19.920
the day the wallet chains died.

54:22.560 --> 54:24.800
The pants were just too big to keep going.

54:24.800 --> 54:25.120
Yeah.

54:25.760 --> 54:26.080
Fuck.

54:26.080 --> 54:28.400
So is this a show, is this a podcast

54:28.400 --> 54:31.600
where we just talk about Cherry Pop and Daddies every couple weeks?

54:31.600 --> 54:32.720
Is that kind of our thing?

54:33.360 --> 54:35.200
This is our Cherry Pop and check-in.

54:35.200 --> 54:37.920
If we don't tell the story, who does, Justin?

54:37.920 --> 54:40.000
I mean, holy tulips, guys.

54:40.000 --> 54:42.160
I guess we're talking about Cherry Pop and Daddies again.

54:42.720 --> 54:42.960
Who lives-

54:42.960 --> 54:46.880
That was the craziest fucking time in pop culture

54:46.880 --> 54:48.480
that I can remember in my entire life.

54:48.480 --> 54:49.360
Because it was li-

54:49.360 --> 54:55.520
Like you could like draw such a clear line around that like two years of time

54:55.520 --> 54:59.120
from like when Swingers came out to when like,

54:59.120 --> 55:02.080
I think Brian said to have played New Year's Rockin' Eve

55:02.080 --> 55:03.600
and everyone went, nah.

55:03.600 --> 55:04.880
Nah, it's not for me, I think.

55:06.000 --> 55:07.120
Thank you, Brian, but no.

55:07.760 --> 55:08.720
And that was the end.

55:08.720 --> 55:10.800
That was the end of like that two years

55:10.800 --> 55:13.280
where like you couldn't swing enough.

55:13.840 --> 55:16.640
I remember dancing to swing music at college parties.

55:16.640 --> 55:17.040
Yeah, absolutely.

55:17.040 --> 55:18.160
Like cool college parties.

55:19.280 --> 55:21.520
I want to, I don't want to talk about the past

55:21.520 --> 55:22.560
because it's just gonna make me sad.

55:22.560 --> 55:23.680
I want to talk about the future.

55:23.680 --> 55:24.960
I'm gonna talk about like a,

55:24.960 --> 55:26.480
you know how Pitch Perfect has kind of like

55:26.480 --> 55:28.560
breathed new life into the acapella scene, right?

55:28.560 --> 55:30.640
And then we got the fucking, what are they called?

55:32.240 --> 55:33.440
Hypnotronics.

55:33.440 --> 55:34.480
Yep, got it.

55:35.840 --> 55:36.720
Like all this shit.

55:36.720 --> 55:37.680
Pentagrams, pentagrams.

55:37.680 --> 55:38.560
The pentagrams?

55:38.560 --> 55:40.240
The pentagrams.

55:40.240 --> 55:42.240
It's all acapella chants.

55:42.800 --> 55:43.520
It's beautiful.

55:43.520 --> 55:45.840
It's all, it's very monastic and Gregorian.

55:45.840 --> 55:48.640
I want to, how can we bring swing back?

55:48.640 --> 55:51.680
Obviously like Swingers, I don't think Swingers 2 could do it.

55:51.680 --> 55:53.840
I don't think Favreau's got it in him anymore.

55:53.840 --> 55:57.440
Well, you need, you need some kind of celebrity driven.

55:57.440 --> 55:59.280
Oh, you know who Swings.

55:59.280 --> 56:02.640
To clarify, I think Favreau is doing some great work,

56:02.640 --> 56:04.320
but I'm saying, I don't think he's got the,

56:04.320 --> 56:06.880
I don't think he can bring an entire fucking genre

56:06.880 --> 56:08.400
of music back to life like he did.

56:08.400 --> 56:09.040
Who can't?

56:09.040 --> 56:11.600
Who has the gravitas that it's not,

56:11.600 --> 56:14.240
it's not just like kitschy and weird.

56:14.240 --> 56:16.800
It's also cool and kitschy and weird.

56:16.800 --> 56:20.560
Like if this person does it, it's now a thing again.

56:20.560 --> 56:21.840
Or this group of people.

56:21.840 --> 56:25.040
How can, yeah, how can we bring it back though?

56:25.040 --> 56:26.560
Oh, how can we bring it back?

56:26.560 --> 56:27.680
Yeah, that's what I'm curious about.

56:27.680 --> 56:30.000
Like I, there's, I see a huge opportunity here

56:30.000 --> 56:32.480
because it's, it is, it's everything that you need

56:32.480 --> 56:34.080
for a pop culture zeitgeist.

56:34.080 --> 56:35.200
And it doesn't have to be very long.

56:35.200 --> 56:37.840
Like however long we need to like get our millions

56:37.840 --> 56:40.080
and bounce and dip from it and let it die again.

56:40.080 --> 56:41.920
Just like the Cherry Pop and Daddies did.

56:41.920 --> 56:43.440
Yeah, they cashed in, they cashed out.

56:43.440 --> 56:45.360
As much shit as we give those, that crew,

56:45.920 --> 56:47.200
they knew what they were doing.

56:47.200 --> 56:47.920
They got their money.

56:47.920 --> 56:49.360
Now they're Cherry Popping granddaddies

56:49.360 --> 56:50.320
and they don't do it anymore.

56:50.320 --> 56:52.800
Yeah, I think they're all pretty still young and vital.

56:52.800 --> 56:56.160
Anyway, how can we bring swing music back?

56:56.160 --> 56:57.760
Because can we do it with our podcast?

56:57.760 --> 57:00.080
Because that feels like maybe not gonna happen.

57:00.880 --> 57:04.480
Well, I would not rather, I would rather not like cash in

57:05.120 --> 57:08.640
the cultural cache that we spent all these years building

57:08.640 --> 57:13.680
on like a last ditch attempt to bring swing music back.

57:13.680 --> 57:15.440
No, what we need to do is we need to look to the future

57:15.440 --> 57:17.040
and see what the next big dance cra,

57:17.040 --> 57:19.920
like maybe we bring Charleston back into vogue.

57:19.920 --> 57:21.920
Maybe we bring back the 23 Skadoo.

57:21.920 --> 57:22.880
What's the next thing?

57:22.880 --> 57:24.880
You gotta look forward to look back.

57:24.880 --> 57:25.440
That's true.

57:26.320 --> 57:28.800
I mean, isn't Drake already doing that?

57:29.360 --> 57:30.640
Is Drake doing the Charleston?

57:30.640 --> 57:32.960
Is Drake doing the 23 Skadoo?

57:32.960 --> 57:34.720
He does a lot of old man dancing.

57:34.720 --> 57:35.760
He Skadid it.

57:35.760 --> 57:37.040
He Skadun it.

57:37.040 --> 57:37.920
He Skadid it.

57:37.920 --> 57:38.800
He Skadrake.

57:40.000 --> 57:41.920
What's the next, what's another big thing?

57:41.920 --> 57:44.720
Maybe the, what about the Foxtrot?

57:44.720 --> 57:46.240
It's got a cool name.

57:46.240 --> 57:50.000
You could have like a sexy CGI Fox doing it.

57:50.000 --> 57:50.880
With Paula Abdul?

57:50.880 --> 57:52.000
With Paula Abdul.

57:52.800 --> 57:54.400
You know she's an ether work.

57:54.400 --> 57:55.520
I was singing a-

57:55.520 --> 57:57.280
You can have a CGI Paula Abdul.

57:58.320 --> 57:59.200
I was singing a song-

57:59.200 --> 58:02.240
Singing with a real cat, but the cat is real.

58:02.240 --> 58:03.440
Oh shit.

58:05.520 --> 58:07.680
I was singing that song to my wife this morning

58:07.680 --> 58:09.200
and trying to do both parts at once.

58:09.200 --> 58:12.320
And I realized that that is gonna be my karaoke white whale.

58:12.320 --> 58:14.480
Like if we find out a fucking meteor is about to hit

58:14.480 --> 58:17.120
the earth tomorrow, tonight I'm going out

58:17.120 --> 58:21.120
and I'm gonna sing both parts of opposites attract.

58:21.120 --> 58:22.880
Who did the cat part in that?

58:22.880 --> 58:23.680
Why don't I know that?

58:23.680 --> 58:24.960
MC Skat Kat, Travis, yes.

58:24.960 --> 58:27.360
Because we were watching RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars

58:27.360 --> 58:30.640
and they had the fucking lip sync for their life

58:30.640 --> 58:32.240
and it credited MC Skat Kat.

58:32.240 --> 58:33.760
That cartoon got a fucking credit.

58:33.760 --> 58:34.260
What?

58:34.960 --> 58:37.360
Was there, okay, wait, hold on.

58:37.360 --> 58:37.680
Yeah.

58:37.680 --> 58:40.160
Was there a performer named MC Skat Kat

58:40.160 --> 58:41.520
that the cat was raised on?

58:42.080 --> 58:43.440
That somebody said, wait, who did it?

58:43.440 --> 58:45.600
MC Skat Kat, I have the best idea.

58:46.160 --> 58:48.320
Or we are to believe that Paula Abdul

58:48.320 --> 58:50.560
somehow got cool-worlded, which God,

58:50.560 --> 58:52.240
it happens to so many people.

58:52.240 --> 58:53.680
It happens, you don't see enough,

58:53.680 --> 58:56.000
there's so much awareness that needs to be brought

58:56.000 --> 58:58.480
to the cool-worlding of America's youth.

58:58.480 --> 59:00.640
Right, and so she got cool-worlded

59:00.640 --> 59:01.920
and it produced it in there.

59:01.920 --> 59:04.320
But no, that man was just a cartoon in there.

59:04.320 --> 59:07.120
There was, there is no flash MC Skat Kat.

59:08.240 --> 59:11.280
There was, I mean, there was a person

59:11.280 --> 59:12.960
who did the voice of MC Skat Kat,

59:12.960 --> 59:14.880
but he doesn't get the fucking credit.

59:15.760 --> 59:17.120
Like, how do you agree to that?

59:18.160 --> 59:20.800
It was Taylor Steele, Skat Kat.

59:20.800 --> 59:21.760
Well, okay, who is that?

59:22.560 --> 59:25.040
I mean, the person who did the voice of Skat Kat.

59:25.040 --> 59:27.680
Do you want Taylor Steele to be the voice of Skat Kat

59:27.680 --> 59:29.840
and also achieve something else in his life?

59:29.840 --> 59:31.120
Like, I think he's done pretty good.

59:31.120 --> 59:34.400
No, I just feel like shit, like I know who Paula Abdul is

59:34.400 --> 59:36.240
and we credit her with that song.

59:36.240 --> 59:39.840
And here's another dude who's like 50% of the song.

59:39.840 --> 59:43.520
Hi, like my name is Walt Disney.

59:43.520 --> 59:45.440
I did the whole Disney thing

59:45.440 --> 59:47.520
and also like, I'm great at fishing.

59:49.120 --> 59:51.600
No, Taylor Steele is the Ub Iwerks

59:51.600 --> 59:53.920
to Paula Abdul's Walt Disney.

59:53.920 --> 59:55.920
Okay, I just realized something though.

59:55.920 --> 59:57.200
And that is if you take the letters

59:57.200 --> 59:59.120
in the words Taylor Steele and rearrange them,

59:59.120 --> 01:00:00.640
it's just MC Skat Kat.

01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:03.520
I think that this is a, I think it's a pseudonym.

01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:06.960
Why don't you want to believe in my living cartoon world?

01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:09.600
Well, actually, now that I've moved to Los Angeles,

01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:11.280
there's a big wall that runs through Hollywood

01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:13.680
and on the other side, it's just cartoons.

01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:14.500
Yeah.

01:00:14.500 --> 01:00:16.320
We're not allowed over there.

01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:19.120
I would like to close this conversation

01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:22.480
by reading the personality section

01:00:22.480 --> 01:00:24.960
from the Wikipedia page on MC Skat Kat.

01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:29.960
There's somebody who wrote a thesis on like his behaviors.

01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:32.320
According to the press kit

01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:34.560
from Virgin Records media information.

01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:37.200
No, fuck it, I want to read that.

01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:38.880
I want it straight from the source.

01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:40.880
I don't want this peer reviewed bullshit.

01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:43.280
I'm giving you straight from the source

01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:44.320
because there's quotes.

01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:45.600
According to the press kit

01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:48.000
from Virgin Records media information.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:48.880
And Griffin, please stop laughing

01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:50.640
because you're going to mess up the ringtone

01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:51.520
that someone is making.

01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:55.840
According to the press kit

01:00:55.840 --> 01:00:58.000
from Virgin Records media information,

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:01.280
Skat Kat is a street philosopher with an alley cat.

01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:04.880
Skat Kat is a street philosopher with an alley cat.

01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:09.040
He enjoys rapping and dancing

01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:12.080
and has quote, gotten high for the ladies.

01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:13.600
Oh my God in heaven.

01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:16.160
Please fucking just hold on, okay?

01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:20.080
Quote, remains on the smooth tip

01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:23.440
with an old school rap influence

01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:29.440
which adds the street to his new school hip hop.

01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:31.600
I can't breathe.

01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:32.320
Okay, hold on.

01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:36.480
That's all amazing.

01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:39.040
Skat Kat's a street philosopher.

01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:39.600
Oh, fuck me.

01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:40.160
Alley cat, point of view.

01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:41.600
He's on the smooth tip.

01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:45.840
No, Travis, he remains on the smooth tip.

01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:46.320
Yes.

01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:47.440
Direct quote.

01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:49.840
With an old school rap influence

01:01:49.840 --> 01:01:53.600
which adds the street to his new school hip hop.

01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:56.400
Fuck, oh my God, oh my God.

01:01:56.400 --> 01:01:57.920
Fucking, dude, it sounds like,

01:01:57.920 --> 01:02:01.680
it sounds like a binder from 1992 having a stroke.

01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:02.320
Okay, but listen.

01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:02.880
It's amazing.

01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:05.040
The words you've said are amazing.

01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:07.120
But the more amazing thing

01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:12.320
is that this record company's PR outfit said,

01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:15.280
listen to me, music journalists,

01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:18.000
if you're gonna write about fucking MC Skat Kat,

01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:22.560
inform yourself and be responsible with your reporting.

01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:24.320
All I can picture is that in the press conference,

01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:27.120
there was someone standing behind the PR representative

01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:28.880
leaning in every time there was a question

01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:30.560
about MC Skat Kat being like,

01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:31.760
that's not something we can cover.

01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:33.120
Just read the fucking packet.

01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:35.120
How would you, hi, hello.

01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:38.560
This is Greg Donaldson from Rolling Stone.

01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:40.320
How would you characterize his like,

01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:42.000
I don't know, his street behavior?

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.560
Well, if you'd read the fucking packet,

01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:46.480
you would know he's a street philosopher

01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:47.520
who remains on the-

01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:48.720
I'm glad you asked, Greg.

01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:51.040
Listen, he remains on the smooth tip.

01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:52.720
With an old school rap influence

01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:55.280
which adds the street to his new school hip hop.

01:02:55.280 --> 01:03:00.480
Was MC Skat Kat built to be a spinoff humanity?

01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:02.880
Was he the next level of like AI?

01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:04.240
The next evolutionist.

01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:05.040
Yeah, sure.

01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:07.840
Do you think, and no tea, no shade, no pink lemonade.

01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:09.360
I love my furry buddies.

01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:11.600
But do you think that there were people who that was,

01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:12.800
like, I think for a lot of folks,

01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:16.720
it was probably Lola from Space Jam.

01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:18.320
But do you think that there was a slightly older crowd

01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:21.280
who saw MC Skat Kat was like, yep, cool.

01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:21.920
Yes, please.

01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:24.000
He remains on the smooth tip.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.600
I like him because he's on the smooth tip

01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:26.960
and I like his whole aesthetic.

01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:28.800
I enjoy his street philosophy.

01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:31.120
Now that we have hologram technology,

01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:32.960
MC Skat Kat could perform live.

01:03:32.960 --> 01:03:34.000
Holy shit.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.480
He could headline Coachella.

01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:39.600
He could perform live.

01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:42.480
MC Skat Kat feat Trombone Boy.

01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:46.960
What if the fucking last shot of the revival of Fuller House

01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:49.280
is they open a door on a closet

01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:53.520
and MC Skat Kat is like, oh, oh, oh, thank God.

01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:55.440
Gibbler put me in there.

01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:58.160
And I loved every fucking second of it.

01:03:58.160 --> 01:04:01.280
I was Gibbler's sex prisoner and I loved it.

01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:02.480
I loved that.

01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:03.200
Close the door.

01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:04.560
Close the door.

01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:06.320
Put me back in Gibbler's sex cage.

01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:07.600
Put me back.

01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:09.200
You gotta contain the stink.

01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:13.920
Put me back in.

01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:16.400
Holy chalupas, this has been a lot of fun.

01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:17.920
My name is Justin McElroy.

01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:22.000
This has been our podcast, my brother, my brother and me.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:25.040
Listen, there's a Bunker Buddies live show

01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:26.240
coming up April 2nd.

01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:31.920
And that's bit.ly forward slash BB live show.

01:04:31.920 --> 01:04:34.720
It's Travis and his partner Andy talking about

01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:37.840
how you can survive the apocalypse with,

01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:39.760
I believe there's another podcast on there.

01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:40.320
That's correct.

01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:44.640
It's gonna be us and spilled milk in Los Angeles on April 2nd.

01:04:44.640 --> 01:04:49.520
Go to bit.ly forward slash BBB BB live show for all the details.

01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:52.000
We also wanna let you know, as we mentioned

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.720
at the top of the show, the 2016 Max Fun Drive

01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:56.080
is just around the corner.

01:04:56.080 --> 01:04:57.920
This isn't our first time.

01:04:57.920 --> 01:05:00.080
We've rodeoed before, my friends.

01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:03.040
But if you're new to my brother, my brother, me

01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:06.160
and you're new to Max Fun, Max Fun is very, very special

01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:09.200
because it is donor supported, which means that we exist

01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:11.440
because you like the shows that we make.

01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:14.720
And once a year for two weeks, we have the Max Fun Drive,

01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:17.200
which is your chance to not only support the shows

01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:49.440
It's a Departure, off of the album,

01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:50.880
Putting the Days to Bed.

01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:54.080
It's an incredible album and I love it very much.

01:06:54.080 --> 01:06:56.080
You sound disappointed at how incredible it is.

01:06:56.080 --> 01:06:59.920
I'm so moved by it that just in that moment

01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:02.000
I got moved describing it.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.400
I saw a picture of him and Hodgman on,

01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:07.600
they just got back from John and Colton cruise.

01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:10.000
I'd really, hey, listen, I'm just putting this out

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:11.520
in the universe, the secret.

01:07:11.520 --> 01:07:12.880
We'd really like to get on that cruise.

01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:14.400
I would like to do that cruise, please.

01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:16.080
Let us get us on that cruise.

01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:19.520
I think it would be worth the getting that norovirus,

01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:21.360
which I wouldn't even need an outbreak.

01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:23.040
I think me just getting on a boat,

01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:25.360
my body would just be like, you have norovirus now.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:27.920
There's a new environment.

01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:31.200
There'd be a little card left on your bed,

01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:35.040
like, hey, good news, the gym is open at 10 a.m. tomorrow

01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:36.400
and also you have norovirus.

01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:40.720
It's my body's natural offense mechanism against that.

01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:43.040
I've gone camping once in the past decade

01:07:43.040 --> 01:07:44.480
and when I went, my body was like,

01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:47.920
where are we, trees, grass, tents?

01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:49.760
Oh, okay, you have diarrhea now.

01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:53.200
Bippity, boppity, boop, you have diarrhea.

01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:55.280
I'm almost certain, where are we at?

01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:56.240
Let's see, let's see.

01:07:56.240 --> 01:07:58.640
Oh, the Atlantic Ocean, cool, diarrhea.

01:07:58.640 --> 01:07:59.520
You now have it.

01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:02.000
Okay, we're done.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:03.200
Griffin, give us the last question.

01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:04.400
Yeah, this last one was also sent in

01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:06.400
by Zoe Kinski climbing that fucking ladder,

01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:08.160
getting up the leaderboard rankings.

01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:09.760
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:11.600
More than 32 characters who says,

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:17.840
is there one quote from John Malkovich

01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:19.040
which resonates with you?

01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:22.560
My name is Justin McElroy.

01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:23.680

I'm Griffin McElroy.

01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:26.160
It's been my brother, my brother and me.

01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:42.320

Are you troubled by a lack of astute

01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:56.400
yet dick joke filled analysis of bad movies?

01:08:56.400 --> 01:08:58.160
Do you experience feelings of laughter

01:08:58.160 --> 01:08:59.840
and enjoyment when you hear three friends

01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:01.600
go off on stupid tangents?

01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:03.200
Have you or any of your family

01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:05.360
ever seen a spook, specter, ghost,

01:09:05.360 --> 01:09:07.680
or totally rad party dude house cat

01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:10.080
who really only exists as a sound effect?

01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:12.320
If the answer to any of these questions is yes,

01:09:12.320 --> 01:09:14.800
then pick up your podcast listening device of choice
