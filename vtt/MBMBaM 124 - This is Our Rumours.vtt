00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.360 --> 00:16.000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:16.000 --> 00:30.880
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.880 --> 00:45.120
It's a new craze, and good girls, do you want it? Just say, hey, I wanna. Just say, hey, I wanna.

00:45.120 --> 00:47.920
Welcome, my brother, my brother, and me, an advice show for the modern era,

00:47.920 --> 00:52.720
where we're about to find out what's in the box. What's in the box? I got a box, and now

00:52.720 --> 00:58.720
I'm opening it, and I want to know what's inside. Griffin, what's in the box? I'm using my car keys,

00:58.720 --> 01:03.680
and it's not good. Let's take guesses what's in the box. Is it an exciting product from extreme

01:03.680 --> 01:10.400
restraints? A dead fish. Nope, because I'm afraid of my penis. I'm afraid of what it might do one day.

01:10.400 --> 01:16.480
Your penis is a dead fish? Man, you're taking people on a sonic journey with these box cut

01:16.480 --> 01:20.320
noises. This is like that thing at Cosi where you put the headphones on and sat in the dark

01:20.320 --> 01:23.600
room and listen to the people walk through the haunted house. This is like Radio Lab,

01:23.600 --> 01:28.720
but instead of talking about emotional science, I'm opening up. Oh, it's a high definition webcam.

01:28.720 --> 01:37.440
That's not interesting. One of the bad things about using Amazon Prime for all your purchasing

01:37.440 --> 01:43.840
is that every once in a while you'll excitedly open a Downy Ball. That's something I learned

01:43.840 --> 01:51.120
today when I excitedly opened a package to find that I had ordered a triple pack of the Downy Ball.

01:51.120 --> 01:56.240
Let's play what is the most humiliating thing that you bought on Amazon just so

01:56.240 --> 02:00.720
you wouldn't have to go to the store. Justin, I'm assuming your answer is Downy Ball.

02:00.720 --> 02:08.720
No, for me, the answer is a 40 pound bag of cat litter. That was only because I was afraid my

02:08.720 --> 02:15.360
spindly, reedy arms wouldn't be able to lug the shit dirt out of the store.

02:15.360 --> 02:21.680
Was that just for the novelty of like, if I didn't have Amazon Prime,

02:21.680 --> 02:24.160
this would cost me like $400 to ship.

02:25.920 --> 02:30.160
And they ship it in a box and it's a giant box and you get home and you're like,

02:30.160 --> 02:35.600
oh my God, that's either the ventriloquist dummy I ordered or a big bag of shit dirt.

02:35.600 --> 02:37.760
Or possibly Jimmy Hoffa.

02:38.400 --> 02:41.360
Oh man, it's the other one, the one I don't want.

02:41.360 --> 02:44.640
What? I ordered Centrum chewable vitamins.

02:46.080 --> 02:50.960
But that's, I just didn't, when I'm at the grocery store, I don't think,

02:51.600 --> 02:56.560
like when I think about getting my VITES at the grocery store, I'll buy a fucking orange.

02:56.560 --> 02:58.160
Yeah, right. I won't get tablets.

02:58.160 --> 03:01.200
No, you guys are, there's a lot of you guys, 10 million strong and growing.

03:01.200 --> 03:03.520
That's what the ad set tells me.

03:03.520 --> 03:07.520
Well, it's adults, it's adults, it's like adults chewable vitamins for adults.

03:07.520 --> 03:08.240
Sure, right.

03:08.240 --> 03:10.480
They do not taste, they do not taste good.

03:10.480 --> 03:14.800
Why don't they make adult chewables taste, I have these chewable gummy vitamins,

03:14.800 --> 03:20.400
not the super fruit gummies that I used to be on, but I have these chewable adult vitamins

03:20.400 --> 03:23.520
and they are gummy vitamins and they taste terrible.

03:24.560 --> 03:32.320
Yeah, it's because things that are good for you can't be good for your senses.

03:32.320 --> 03:32.560
Right.

03:32.560 --> 03:32.960
You know what I mean?

03:33.680 --> 03:39.200
When I was a kid, I once ate like a whole jar of Spider-Man vitamins

03:39.200 --> 03:41.040
and they were fucking delicious.

03:41.040 --> 03:41.840
Fuck, man.

03:41.840 --> 03:42.560
Wait, what?

03:43.280 --> 03:48.400
How are your, how is your liver and just, how is all of you after that?

03:49.200 --> 03:50.640
He just shit a rock.

03:50.640 --> 03:52.240
He had so many minerals.

03:52.240 --> 03:53.920
Yeah, I just shit nutrition.

03:53.920 --> 03:54.960
It was amazing.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.760
Where were our parents during this?

03:57.760 --> 04:00.240
They were upstairs and it was my Saturday morning snack.

04:01.920 --> 04:05.280
This is an advice, did we do the name thing where we said our names?

04:05.280 --> 04:06.480
We went straight into box adventures.

04:06.480 --> 04:08.480
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

04:08.480 --> 04:10.400
I'm your middle brother, Travis McElroy.

04:10.400 --> 04:13.600
I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

04:13.600 --> 04:15.440
And guys, it's Max Funday.

04:16.800 --> 04:18.800
Max Funday all day.

04:19.440 --> 04:22.720
Is it just me or is Max Funday not like way better than Columbus Day?

04:23.440 --> 04:28.400
Well, it's because Monsignor Maximum Fund didn't come to a country

04:28.400 --> 04:30.400
and then kill everybody in it.

04:30.400 --> 04:34.000
Do you think that like, are the people who assigned Columbus Day

04:34.000 --> 04:36.720
to be like a national holiday, like deeply regret it

04:36.720 --> 04:38.960
once history came to light and they were like,

04:38.960 --> 04:40.640
oh shit, well, we can't take it back now.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.640
Now, wait, do you think that they didn't know it first?

04:44.640 --> 04:47.360
Do you think there were like, it took them a few years to be like,

04:47.360 --> 04:50.000
hey, wait a minute, there aren't that many Native Americans.

04:50.640 --> 04:52.480
No, I think that what they realized was like,

04:52.480 --> 04:54.880
oh, Columbus wasn't the one who discovered America.

04:54.880 --> 04:56.080
It was a Viking.

04:56.080 --> 04:57.600
Well, we'll just keep it Columbus Day

04:57.600 --> 04:59.680
because who wants to celebrate Viking Day?

04:59.680 --> 05:01.280
Wait, that sounds awesome.

05:01.280 --> 05:02.640
Yeah, it sounds actually way better.

05:02.640 --> 05:04.960
Mutton and what and whatnot.

05:04.960 --> 05:06.640
Today is Max Fund Day.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.400
It's the first Max Fund Day.

05:08.400 --> 05:12.240
It's a, like you said, better than Columbus Day

05:12.240 --> 05:14.000
or basically any other holiday.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.720
What we're trying to do is get some new members

05:16.720 --> 05:18.400
to the Maximum Fund family.

05:18.400 --> 05:20.480
We're going down to the adoption agency.

05:20.480 --> 05:24.880
We are looking through the windows, into the cages

05:24.880 --> 05:25.440
where they keep the children.

05:25.440 --> 05:27.040
And we're gonna take home some babies.

05:27.040 --> 05:29.040
We're gonna take home some babies today.

05:29.040 --> 05:31.440
I wanna walk into an adoption agency and just yell,

05:31.440 --> 05:33.360
I'm ready to take home some babies.

05:33.360 --> 05:34.880
Can I tell you guys something?

05:34.880 --> 05:36.560
Seriously, no biscuits here.

05:38.160 --> 05:40.640
I thought, like for my formative years,

05:40.640 --> 05:44.160
I really did think the orphanages were like pet stores

05:44.160 --> 05:45.280
where like you would go in

05:45.280 --> 05:46.800
and there would be kids behind glass.

05:46.800 --> 05:50.000
Yeah, these fucking babies are priced to move.

05:51.200 --> 05:52.880
And in your mind's eye-

05:52.880 --> 05:55.280
There's just like sawdust and wood chips at the bottom

05:55.280 --> 05:57.360
and the babies are like falling all over each other.

05:57.360 --> 05:59.920
And in your mind's eye, they're all babies too.

05:59.920 --> 06:02.240
Cause if they turn five and they don't have a home yet,

06:02.240 --> 06:05.520
I guess they burn them or something.

06:05.520 --> 06:07.600
So today we encourage you to go to-

06:07.600 --> 06:10.000
We go to encourage you to go to maximumfund.org

06:10.000 --> 06:12.160
forward slash maxfundday.

06:13.600 --> 06:16.960
If you can throw us a $10 a month donation,

06:16.960 --> 06:19.520
I know it doesn't seem like much money at all,

06:19.520 --> 06:21.840
but we do some amazing things with that cash.

06:21.840 --> 06:23.280
We make Judge John Hodgman.

06:23.280 --> 06:24.480
We make Memory Palace.

06:24.480 --> 06:26.160
We make this show.

06:26.160 --> 06:28.080
We make Throwing Shades.

06:28.080 --> 06:29.040
Origami Flowers.

06:29.040 --> 06:30.240
Origami Flowers.

06:30.240 --> 06:30.800
What?

06:30.800 --> 06:32.080
Origami Flowers.

06:32.080 --> 06:34.080
We make origami flowers from your money

06:34.080 --> 06:35.360
and then throw it in the garbage.

06:36.560 --> 06:37.840
I take wishes

06:37.840 --> 06:40.480
and I put them inside those origami money flowers

06:40.480 --> 06:42.560
and I set them out onto the lake.

06:43.120 --> 06:44.400
The Asian lake.

06:44.400 --> 06:45.840
And then we fire arrows at them

06:45.840 --> 06:47.520
and have a Viking burial for your money.

06:48.480 --> 06:49.840
So donate, won't you?

06:49.840 --> 06:52.080
We're always adding new shows to the family.

06:52.640 --> 06:54.320
Always adopting new babies.

06:54.320 --> 06:58.480
This time last year, did we have international waters?

06:58.480 --> 07:00.960
Did we have, I guess we had JJ Ho.

07:00.960 --> 07:03.440
Did we have, we did not have Throwing Shades though.

07:03.440 --> 07:05.040
We certainly didn't have Memory Palace

07:05.040 --> 07:06.080
and we didn't have Risk.

07:07.040 --> 07:08.640
Those are only made possible,

07:08.640 --> 07:10.560
those shows are made possible because of your gift.

07:11.360 --> 07:13.360
And we are going to put out,

07:13.360 --> 07:17.600
as you might be suspecting if you are an existing donor

07:17.600 --> 07:19.200
or a new donor,

07:19.200 --> 07:21.360
you're gonna get a special episode

07:21.360 --> 07:22.720
of My Brother, My Brother, Me

07:22.720 --> 07:24.400
that we recorded last night

07:24.400 --> 07:26.160
that is, I think it is fair to say,

07:26.160 --> 07:28.640
unlike any other you have ever experienced.

07:28.640 --> 07:30.480
It was the super silliest.

07:30.480 --> 07:31.360
Here's the tease.

07:31.360 --> 07:32.640
We gave each other advice.

07:33.280 --> 07:36.240
And we were kind of drinking a little bit.

07:36.240 --> 07:37.760
And so sleepy.

07:37.760 --> 07:39.520
So it got a little tazy.

07:39.520 --> 07:40.800
It got a little crazy in there.

07:40.800 --> 07:42.400
So go to Maximum Fun Day.

07:42.400 --> 07:45.920
Go to MaximumFun.org forward slash Max Fun Day.

07:45.920 --> 07:47.200
And if you're already a member,

07:47.200 --> 07:48.880
you know, you're already giving, that's great.

07:49.440 --> 07:51.520
Tell a friend, tweet it out.

07:52.720 --> 07:54.160
Tweet that URL out.

07:54.160 --> 07:55.680
Get into some, we're gonna,

07:55.680 --> 07:57.680
Griffin and I are gonna do a Google Hangout today.

07:57.680 --> 08:00.800
Okay, you wanna go get all the details there.

08:00.800 --> 08:04.720
So MaximumFun.org forward slash Max Fun Day is the address.

08:04.720 --> 08:07.280
Please go and help us build something great.

08:08.560 --> 08:10.240
And now let's get into the advice.

08:10.240 --> 08:10.800
I'm ready.

08:11.680 --> 08:12.240
I'm ready.

08:12.240 --> 08:14.080
Do it.

08:14.080 --> 08:15.840
I guess I'm ready too.

08:15.840 --> 08:16.880
Okay, well, you gotta be ready.

08:16.880 --> 08:17.840
You have no choice.

08:17.840 --> 08:18.480
Fuck.

08:18.480 --> 08:20.480
About a year ago, he moved into my father-in-law.

08:22.240 --> 08:22.640
Ow.

08:23.280 --> 08:24.880
How did he get, hey, get out of there.

08:24.880 --> 08:30.480
He's roomy and spacious, and we encourage others looking for a shelter to join us in his need.

08:30.480 --> 08:33.520
We knocked out a wall, we turned two rooms into one room, really opened the place up.

08:33.520 --> 08:36.880
Hey, if you're in there, don't knock out any walls.

08:36.880 --> 08:38.640
Almost all of them are essential.

08:38.640 --> 08:41.680
They moved your father-in-law across the country before.

08:41.680 --> 08:46.480
That time he had asked me to call him dad, which was very sweet, meant a lot to me.

08:46.480 --> 08:48.640
The issue now is that he's here and it's kind of weird.

08:48.640 --> 08:51.200
I love him very much, but he's not my dad.

08:51.200 --> 08:53.280
So every time I try to make myself call him that,

08:53.280 --> 08:55.600
it just feels wrong and I can't do it.

08:55.600 --> 08:58.640
At this point, I'm using his first name to talk about it with other people,

08:58.640 --> 09:04.720
and a mishmash of hey, grumpy, and assorted mumbles when I address him directly.

09:04.720 --> 09:08.560
I can't get past how wrong it seems to call anybody but my actual dad.

09:08.560 --> 09:10.160
Dad, help.

09:10.160 --> 09:13.600
That's from Who's My Daddy in Cincinnati, which is a nice little bit of-

09:13.600 --> 09:14.080
I like it.

09:14.960 --> 09:16.720
Yeah, a little bit of rhyming, which I appreciate.

09:17.680 --> 09:20.400
You know, in acting, there's this idea of like,

09:20.400 --> 09:23.760
if you try to do an emotional moment and it feels weird,

09:23.760 --> 09:26.720
it's probably because you did not earn it up to that point.

09:26.720 --> 09:28.720
So maybe you're just not earning calling him dad.

09:28.720 --> 09:29.680
Maybe you gotta earn it.

09:29.680 --> 09:33.360
Like go fishing with him and ask him to teach you to whittle.

09:34.240 --> 09:35.440
Stuff that dads do.

09:37.120 --> 09:41.920
Can I ask why you think grumpy is an acceptable alternative?

09:43.280 --> 09:45.520
Yeah, grumpy seems like a weird pick.

09:45.520 --> 09:48.080
Maybe he's grumpy because you call him grumpy.

09:48.080 --> 09:50.880
Instead, like, I don't mind if you don't call me daddy,

09:50.880 --> 09:53.200
but can you please not call me grumpy?

09:53.200 --> 10:01.920
When I had a friend at church who used to call pooping,

10:01.920 --> 10:03.440
he would call that grumpy.

10:03.440 --> 10:04.640
He was gonna make grumpy.

10:06.240 --> 10:10.720
The logic being that the face that you make-

10:12.400 --> 10:13.360
It's very much-

10:13.360 --> 10:14.240
It's a grumpy face.

10:14.240 --> 10:18.080
That's a very childish thing to say, but I can't hear that word

10:18.080 --> 10:20.720
without thinking of, yeah, I'm getting grumpy.

10:20.720 --> 10:22.560
Anyway, were we doing a show?

10:23.360 --> 10:27.040
I'm sorry, did we have a thing we were talking about?

10:27.040 --> 10:30.960
Can you upgrade it to daddy or sweetums or-

10:30.960 --> 10:31.840
Sweets Parappa.

10:33.120 --> 10:34.480
Sweets for fruit.

10:34.480 --> 10:35.440
Sweets Parappa.

10:36.080 --> 10:37.040
And then-

10:37.040 --> 10:38.320
Hello, Sweets Parappa.

10:39.360 --> 10:42.720
If you can stick with that for 48 hours,

10:42.720 --> 10:45.360
and then when you downgrade it back down to dad,

10:45.360 --> 10:46.400
it's gonna be great.

10:46.400 --> 10:46.900
Yeah.

10:48.400 --> 10:53.760
I mean, you've got to let it come naturally.

10:55.120 --> 10:59.680
If it feels weird to you, then you may not have that relationship.

10:59.680 --> 11:01.040
That's what I'm saying.

11:01.040 --> 11:07.520
I didn't call my in-laws mom and dad for quite a long time.

11:07.520 --> 11:09.360
I don't think I've ever heard you call them that.

11:09.360 --> 11:14.160
Yeah, it's something that I call them when I'm feeling very close to them.

11:14.160 --> 11:15.920
When no one's around in the secret times.

11:15.920 --> 11:19.280
No, no, it's something I call when it feels appropriate.

11:19.280 --> 11:20.480
It doesn't always feel appropriate.

11:20.480 --> 11:24.320
Sometimes it feels weird, but sometimes it feels appropriate.

11:24.320 --> 11:25.840
I mean, we're very close now.

11:25.840 --> 11:30.640
We are more like family, and it feels natural,

11:30.640 --> 11:32.560
but don't try to force it.

11:32.560 --> 11:36.080
I don't even feel comfortable calling Teresa's parents by their first names.

11:36.080 --> 11:39.120
Yeah. There's something about being like, hey, Mike, what's up?

11:40.000 --> 11:43.280
Something about it seems so informal and disrespectful.

11:43.280 --> 11:45.600
I know that I do call them that,

11:45.600 --> 11:48.560
but it still is always a catch before I do it.

11:48.560 --> 11:50.480
It doesn't feel natural yet.

11:50.480 --> 11:53.680
What we need is an English usted, right?

11:54.720 --> 11:56.400
We need the formal term.

11:57.680 --> 12:01.840
Usted in Spanish basically means hey you,

12:01.840 --> 12:06.320
which is basically like, hey, you person that is better than me.

12:06.320 --> 12:10.880
You're better than me, and this is me addressing you free of gender.

12:11.760 --> 12:13.120
That is what we need.

12:13.120 --> 12:15.120
That is what we need in the English language.

12:15.120 --> 12:19.920
Hey, you might work, but it feels a little imperative to me.

12:20.720 --> 12:22.640
Yeah, imperative?

12:23.440 --> 12:25.120
Yeah, it's like your shot.

12:25.120 --> 12:30.640
It might be, it seems to have an urgency to it that may not always be applicable.

12:30.640 --> 12:32.160
Yeah.

12:32.160 --> 12:40.160
What we need is just a, just a, like, oh, God, boss, now boss doesn't work.

12:40.160 --> 12:40.720
Boss man?

12:42.160 --> 12:47.600
I want to, at this point, I rarely, we rarely reference culture on this show.

12:47.600 --> 12:48.640
Your honor.

12:48.640 --> 12:50.240
Your honor, your excellency.

12:50.240 --> 12:51.600
Ooh, my liege.

12:51.600 --> 12:57.120
But I, this song, this brings to mind a classic country tune,

12:57.120 --> 13:00.160
the only number one hit for Doug Supernaw.

13:01.120 --> 13:03.520
And the chorus of it goes a little something like this.

13:05.280 --> 13:10.000
I don't call him daddy, but he takes care of things.

13:10.480 --> 13:14.960
When you pick me up on Friday, are you gonna bring me anything?

13:15.680 --> 13:20.080
Oh, don't worry, dad, you know it don't matter what we do.

13:21.120 --> 13:23.760
Cause I don't call him daddy.

13:23.760 --> 13:27.360
He could never be like you, be like you.

13:28.400 --> 13:33.600
Now, now if you're going to sing that song to your dad with a straight face,

13:34.560 --> 13:36.720
you don't want to be a liar.

13:36.720 --> 13:41.200
Doug Supernaw did not go to his father and sing that song at his deathbed

13:42.480 --> 13:45.680
as his stepfather looked on in sadness.

13:45.680 --> 13:48.080
He did not do that with a heavy heart.

13:48.080 --> 13:49.600
He did it with a clear conscience.

13:49.600 --> 13:52.720
Is it possible, is it possible, Justin, that he did not-

13:52.720 --> 13:54.080
Anything's possible.

13:54.080 --> 13:57.600
Okay, but is it probable that he did not do that at all?

14:00.160 --> 14:02.800
I am not that close with the Supernaw family.

14:02.800 --> 14:05.520
Now, was it originally recorded by Kenny Rogers?

14:05.520 --> 14:05.760
Yes.

14:06.560 --> 14:09.200
Could that, could Kenny Rogers have done that?

14:09.200 --> 14:09.840
Perhaps.

14:09.840 --> 14:12.400
Was he saying that he doesn't call Kenny Rogers daddy?

14:13.440 --> 14:17.280
No, yes, I'm going to record your song, but I'm not going to call you.

14:17.280 --> 14:18.720
It's not technically Kenny Rogers song.

14:18.720 --> 14:23.440
It was, of course, written by the power duo of Nielsen-Pearson.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.240
This is like a book on tape of Wikipedia.

14:28.160 --> 14:28.880
I'm sorry.

14:29.840 --> 14:34.480
Actually, the guy who wrote it was the first point at which I had to use Wikipedia.

14:34.480 --> 14:37.680
I know a little bit about country music because this song was really big

14:37.680 --> 14:40.960
at the time when I was a country music DJ named Justin Tyler, so.

14:42.160 --> 14:44.160
Can you permanently just change it to that?

14:44.880 --> 14:45.120
What?

14:45.680 --> 14:46.560
Justin Tyler.

14:46.560 --> 14:48.880
It sounds just- We want you out of the family.

14:48.880 --> 14:52.000
It's not, I don't have shame about my last name.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.840
Just that one sounds a lot better.

14:56.160 --> 15:01.280
If you had some way of tapping into it, there's little in my life I'm embarrassed about.

15:01.280 --> 15:05.840
I'm not actually embarrassed about this either, but if you had the wherewithal,

15:05.840 --> 15:09.920
you could probably find tapes of me speaking excitedly about the exploits of Tim McGraw.

15:09.920 --> 15:13.680
Oh, fuck, please, please.

15:13.680 --> 15:14.800
Somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody.

15:14.800 --> 15:16.160
I do remember a news story.

15:16.160 --> 15:24.640
I said where Tim McGraw was talking about Faith Hill's new record and he said,

15:24.640 --> 15:27.840
I think it's sonically the best record she's ever made.

15:29.520 --> 15:31.120
Visually, it's lacking.

15:31.760 --> 15:32.800
Visually, it's lacking.

15:32.800 --> 15:35.360
Sonically, it's one of her best records ever made.

15:35.360 --> 15:37.680
And he actually said, I think this is her rumors.

15:38.640 --> 15:39.140
Wow.

15:42.480 --> 15:43.520
Absolutely perfect.

15:43.520 --> 15:44.000
Christ.

15:44.000 --> 15:47.520
Can we do everything in our power to make this episode of the podcast Our Rumors?

15:49.520 --> 15:51.840
In fact, we should call this episode Our Rumors.

15:53.360 --> 15:54.320
Griffin, do you have a Yahoo?

15:55.040 --> 15:55.520
I do.

15:55.520 --> 15:56.560
You know what I was just thinking about?

15:56.560 --> 15:59.600
One of the names we almost went with for the show is Bro Your Own Way.

15:59.600 --> 16:00.320
That's true.

16:00.320 --> 16:01.600
Yeah, so good.

16:01.600 --> 16:02.480
Alt reality.

16:02.480 --> 16:03.200
It could have been.

16:04.160 --> 16:06.320
This Yahoo was sent in by Steve M. Romaine.

16:06.320 --> 16:07.120
Thank you, Steve M.

16:07.120 --> 16:09.520
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Baelin.

16:09.520 --> 16:17.760
Baelin, who asks, if horses were people, who do you think they'd vote for?

16:20.080 --> 16:22.480
My eight-year-old is the more dominant one.

16:22.480 --> 16:25.680
I think she would try to vote herself as the president.

16:26.480 --> 16:30.800
My 11-year-old, she'd probably be too lazy to get up there and vote.

16:31.360 --> 16:34.960
But if she could, she'd choose the one with the better tie, XD.

16:36.480 --> 16:37.520
What about your horses?

16:37.520 --> 16:38.880
Fucking kidding.

16:38.880 --> 16:40.000
Who would you vote for?

16:40.960 --> 16:43.440
I think they'd vote for Ralph Nader.

16:46.560 --> 16:47.840
You damn shit.

16:50.320 --> 16:52.240
At least I waited until Griffin finished the question.

16:52.240 --> 16:53.440
I sat on that one for like half an hour.

16:53.440 --> 16:54.400
You know what?

16:54.400 --> 16:55.360
I appreciate that.

16:55.360 --> 16:59.360
Now, let me just go ahead and tell you that it seemed like a half an hour to you

17:01.040 --> 17:03.200
and your millisecond long attention span.

17:03.200 --> 17:10.720
I think that it is insane to think that horses, if given the ability to vote,

17:10.720 --> 17:12.640
would vote for different people.

17:12.640 --> 17:19.040
They would be so oppressed that I am almost positive they would be voting as a block.

17:19.680 --> 17:26.000
You would have to woo the horse vote because you would go to whatever candidate is more friendly

17:26.000 --> 17:29.760
to your cause.

17:29.760 --> 17:36.960
Can I suggest that if a horse could vote, it would probably vote for Salt.

17:39.200 --> 17:45.200
Or, if you will, if we want to make this functional, the saltiest of the two candidates.

17:46.480 --> 17:51.280
Whichever would happen to be holding a crunchy apple at the moment of voting.

17:51.280 --> 17:58.000
Who do you think, if licked, which presidential candidate

17:58.000 --> 18:00.800
do you think would provide the most flavor?

18:01.680 --> 18:04.480
I don't think there's a way to not like this about race.

18:04.480 --> 18:09.440
I think that there is and the fact that you just said that is kind of racist.

18:09.440 --> 18:09.680
Okay.

18:10.320 --> 18:11.600
Here's my deeper question about-

18:11.600 --> 18:13.600
You know, horses really care about race.

18:14.160 --> 18:14.400
Yeah.

18:16.240 --> 18:17.680
Here's my deeper question about this-

18:17.680 --> 18:21.360
Hold on, because Travis, Travis, Travis, because horses like to race.

18:24.320 --> 18:25.120
I got you.

18:25.120 --> 18:29.360
God, there's a fucking Laffy Taffy joke in there somewhere.

18:29.360 --> 18:30.960
If you could find it, people at home.

18:31.680 --> 18:35.360
I want to know what the personality is of this person's 11-year-old horse that makes

18:35.360 --> 18:38.160
them think that their decision would be based on the tie.

18:39.840 --> 18:40.800
What is it about ties?

18:40.800 --> 18:44.240
Does this horse in his everyday life choose paisley over stripes?

18:44.240 --> 18:44.480
Sure.

18:44.480 --> 18:47.680
Is it, maybe it tried to eat his tie once.

18:48.240 --> 18:57.280
There's no way that we can discuss this without becoming the kind of like sickening whimsy

18:57.280 --> 19:00.400
that sort of characterizes the Yahoo Answers service.

19:00.400 --> 19:02.000
Griffin, just keep it open mind.

19:02.000 --> 19:05.120
Let's just talk, the horse, like maybe the horse likes to wear ties.

19:05.120 --> 19:07.280
Maybe he puts like horse ties on him.

19:07.280 --> 19:07.280
Oh, Christ.

19:07.280 --> 19:10.480
You can't go into Yahoo Answers with an open mind.

19:10.480 --> 19:11.760
That's how they get you.

19:11.760 --> 19:16.080
That's how they get you, you have to go and close-minded to protect yourself.

19:16.080 --> 19:17.040
How to touch.

19:17.040 --> 19:18.960
Maybe, you gotta be careful.

19:18.960 --> 19:20.560
Maybe he's a real close horse.

19:21.120 --> 19:21.920
All right, all right.

19:21.920 --> 19:24.080
Okay, Griffin, what are the answers?

19:24.080 --> 19:26.000
I will flip the fucking kill switch.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.440
Here's, here's what's great.

19:27.440 --> 19:34.080
The top answer is a link to a November 2011 Washington Times article.

19:34.080 --> 19:37.040
And I'd like to read you the lead, if I can.

19:37.040 --> 19:41.120
President Obama last month quietly signed into law a spending bill

19:41.120 --> 19:44.560
that restores the American horse slaughter industry.

19:44.560 --> 19:45.520
Yay!

19:49.520 --> 19:50.960
So Romney?

19:50.960 --> 19:56.720
I guess Romney, but more importantly, yeah, I think that quietly is the only way

19:56.720 --> 19:58.720
to sign that kind of bill into law.

19:58.720 --> 20:00.880
He dropped a banner from behind him.

20:00.880 --> 20:02.800
It's not gonna end up in the-

20:02.800 --> 20:04.560
Mission accomplished.

20:04.560 --> 20:05.600
We got him again.

20:05.600 --> 20:07.280
Yeah, I got Obama.

20:07.280 --> 20:08.240
Osama bin Laden.

20:08.240 --> 20:09.440
You know who else I got?

20:09.440 --> 20:10.720
All the horses.

20:10.720 --> 20:12.960
Yeah, Mr. Ed, more like Mr. Dead.

20:12.960 --> 20:13.920
Peace out, horses.

20:13.920 --> 20:14.480
I hate you.

20:14.480 --> 20:16.720
Obama, 2012.

20:17.760 --> 20:18.560
Answer three.

20:18.560 --> 20:19.600
That's a tough one.

20:19.600 --> 20:23.840
On the one hand, my horses would fit better with the Republican

20:23.840 --> 20:26.720
just leave me alone and stay out of my business mentality.

20:26.720 --> 20:27.680
Oh my God.

20:28.240 --> 20:31.840
But on the other hand, they'd like to be taken care of by the government,

20:31.840 --> 20:32.880
like Democrats.

20:32.880 --> 20:39.040
Oh God, horses are a generous people, you know?

20:39.600 --> 20:43.600
I don't think that, I think that it's a fallacy to think that horses

20:43.600 --> 20:46.320
wouldn't also want to take care of people.

20:47.200 --> 20:47.920
Am I wrong?

20:47.920 --> 20:48.800
Am I wrong about this?

20:50.400 --> 20:51.360
Horses are free.

20:51.360 --> 20:54.320
When you ride a horse, it's like borrowing wings from God.

20:57.280 --> 21:01.520
Two riders, one heart is basically what I'm saying to you.

21:01.520 --> 21:03.680
Sure, yeah.

21:03.680 --> 21:08.960
I think, I think they would probably go GOP.

21:09.840 --> 21:12.240
Yeah, gallop an old party.

21:14.000 --> 21:17.600
Because I'll tell you why, because they hate donkeys, I guess.

21:17.600 --> 21:18.640
Sure, sure, yeah.

21:18.640 --> 21:22.080
That joke, I got about 20% of the way through making that joke.

21:22.720 --> 21:24.960
And then I started googling stuff and instead.

21:26.720 --> 21:28.880
Did you say you started googling stuff or stuffing?

21:28.880 --> 21:33.440
Because I myself would like to know how I'm going to save everyone without resorting to

21:33.440 --> 21:34.240
water chestnuts.

21:35.120 --> 21:35.920
It's impossible.

21:36.800 --> 21:39.760
Hey, I have a question.

21:41.680 --> 21:47.040
I'm in my third year of college and I'm looking for funny movie plots I can turn into short

21:47.040 --> 21:48.240
student films.

21:48.240 --> 21:49.360
Any suggestions?

21:49.360 --> 21:50.400
And this is from Hoosh.

21:50.960 --> 21:55.440
Now guys, this isn't a typical question that we answer.

21:55.440 --> 21:59.200
And I just want to take a moment to say you're better than this, Hoosh.

22:00.720 --> 22:00.960
How?

22:02.080 --> 22:04.720
So you put this question, I want to make it clear here.

22:04.720 --> 22:06.560
You, you composed the question list this week.

22:06.560 --> 22:09.440
You put this in strictly to shame Hoosh.

22:09.440 --> 22:13.200
I wanted to shame Hoosh because Hoosh, you're better than this.

22:14.160 --> 22:20.240
You're, I, you do not think you can come to our door with your, with your hollowed out

22:20.240 --> 22:26.640
pumpkin, knock on a door, trick or treat and get us to throw the fun sized baby Ruth of

22:26.640 --> 22:30.160
our inspiration into your, into your bucket.

22:30.160 --> 22:32.640
It's, it's unfair and it's hurtful, Hoosh.

22:32.640 --> 22:34.000
And you're better than it.

22:34.000 --> 22:38.320
Plus, I am not going to crack open my black and white notebook to give you all of my hilarious

22:38.320 --> 22:39.840
short student film ideas.

22:39.840 --> 22:43.600
The other reason I added this question is because I thought Travis probably had a few

22:43.600 --> 22:44.400
that he could spare.

22:45.280 --> 22:49.200
I, I every day, I burp and a movie idea comes out.

22:49.200 --> 22:49.760
Yeah.

22:49.760 --> 22:56.400
It got to the point when, when Travis is younger, where I told him that in order to, in order

22:56.400 --> 23:00.960
to listen to more of his plots for movies, he had to make one.

23:00.960 --> 23:02.000
I remember that.

23:02.000 --> 23:02.960
Just one.

23:02.960 --> 23:06.240
And once he made one movie out of one of these plots, I would listen.

23:06.240 --> 23:07.360
It could cycle forward.

23:07.360 --> 23:08.480
The cue had failed.

23:09.120 --> 23:14.240
And it was like he had attended the Dawson Leary School of Cinematic Conceptualizing

23:14.240 --> 23:16.080
because he'd be like, tell me your idea, please.

23:16.080 --> 23:18.160
And you'd be like, witches?

23:18.160 --> 23:19.680
You're like, ah, cool, cool.

23:19.680 --> 23:23.040
I, I, that's not fair.

23:24.080 --> 23:25.360
Some were quite good.

23:25.360 --> 23:28.480
Travis did, in fact, write the entirety of Inception.

23:29.120 --> 23:29.600
That's true.

23:29.600 --> 23:31.440
And it got, it got taken from him.

23:31.440 --> 23:31.760
Ironically.

23:31.760 --> 23:34.160
But my, my ending was quite different.

23:34.160 --> 23:34.400
Yeah.

23:35.040 --> 23:35.680
Good.

23:35.680 --> 23:37.520
In his ending, the top just fell over.

23:38.080 --> 23:40.400
There was a, there was a sense of finality to it.

23:40.400 --> 23:43.120
And then there was like a Benny Hill type chase scene.

23:43.120 --> 23:45.040
And then Leo walks over and picks up his top.

23:45.040 --> 23:46.240
He's like, thank goodness.

23:46.240 --> 23:51.360
I'm glad this isn't, glad to be home with my family.

23:54.720 --> 23:55.280
That's good.

23:55.280 --> 23:57.360
Travis, Travis hates ambiguity.

23:57.360 --> 23:59.120
That's his, that's his bugaboo.

23:59.120 --> 23:59.600
I do.

24:00.640 --> 24:05.040
I hate, I do legit hate any movie that you're supposed to walk out of going,

24:05.040 --> 24:06.320
God, I just don't, I'm not sure.

24:06.320 --> 24:07.200
I think so.

24:07.200 --> 24:08.720
What do you, I want to know.

24:08.720 --> 24:12.160
I want me and the person next to me to know the same thing about the movie.

24:12.160 --> 24:14.400
I'm going to walk out being like, yeah, so it was the dad, right?

24:14.400 --> 24:14.960
It was the dad.

24:14.960 --> 24:15.440
Yeah, cool.

24:15.440 --> 24:15.920
Cool.

24:15.920 --> 24:19.760
So in your version of No Country for Old Men, Tommy Lee Jones is sitting there

24:19.760 --> 24:24.080
and he's talking to his wife about the dream that he had about the man with the fire.

24:24.640 --> 24:27.120
And then he picks up the local paper and he says,

24:27.120 --> 24:29.360
oh, it looks like somebody else got Anton Chigurh.

24:29.360 --> 24:30.880
And then, then the credits roll.

24:32.960 --> 24:35.440
That sounds like a better movie in fairness.

24:35.440 --> 24:37.040
That does sound actually very good.

24:37.040 --> 24:38.800
That sounds pretty good actually.

24:38.800 --> 24:40.480
At the end of Benny Hill music played.

24:40.480 --> 24:40.720
Yep.

24:44.000 --> 24:45.120
I got another question for you.

24:45.120 --> 24:50.720
Quickie, how long into relationship do you think it becomes weird to not say I love you?

24:50.720 --> 24:53.760
My boyfriend and I have been going out for a year and have not said it.

24:54.480 --> 24:56.160
Even though I know the feeling is there.

24:56.960 --> 24:57.920
That's from anonymous.

24:58.720 --> 25:00.720
Are you, are you waiting for him to say it?

25:00.720 --> 25:02.000
Why haven't you said it?

25:02.000 --> 25:04.320
Ooh, you think it's a chicken situation.

25:04.320 --> 25:09.520
I, I, I could see that being a real possibility of both people feeling it.

25:09.520 --> 25:12.160
If you know the love is there, both people feeling it,

25:12.160 --> 25:17.200
but being afraid to say it and not wanting to be like, oh, we're in love, right?

25:17.200 --> 25:18.320
Like that's awkward.

25:18.960 --> 25:20.640
So maybe just say it.

25:20.640 --> 25:23.920
And if after a year he's like, oh, what?

25:23.920 --> 25:27.280
Oh, then it's probably best you find that out.

25:27.280 --> 25:32.080
If you don't go ahead and say it, this is going to turn into a thing where

25:32.880 --> 25:34.560
you're going to wake up one of these days.

25:34.560 --> 25:37.600
And it may, I may not be tomorrow, but it's going to be soon.

25:37.600 --> 25:40.560
You're going to wake up and realize that it would be weird to say it at this point.

25:40.560 --> 25:41.040
Yeah.

25:41.040 --> 25:42.480
Mm hmm.

25:42.480 --> 25:43.120
Oh, I can't.

25:43.120 --> 25:44.320
I mean, I can't do it now.

25:44.320 --> 25:48.480
If I wasn't going to do it before, like I can't like say, I love you now.

25:48.480 --> 25:49.200
It would be weird.

25:49.200 --> 25:51.920
This is a conversation I've had and heard many times that,

25:52.480 --> 25:54.720
how long did you guys wait before you said it?

25:54.720 --> 25:57.600
Can you imagine being at a party and someone asks you that question right now?

25:58.560 --> 26:01.600
And you both like knew that you had never told each other.

26:03.280 --> 26:05.440
That's going to ruin the relationship.

26:05.440 --> 26:06.480
Can I tell you something?

26:07.520 --> 26:09.520
Just say, I love you.

26:09.520 --> 26:10.400
Just say, I love you.

26:10.400 --> 26:10.960
I love you.

26:10.960 --> 26:11.760
You love the person.

26:11.760 --> 26:14.880
You've been with them for a year and you haven't put a steak knife through their neck.

26:14.880 --> 26:15.680
You love them.

26:15.680 --> 26:16.000
Yeah.

26:16.000 --> 26:16.640
That's love.

26:17.600 --> 26:20.640
Maybe you could start out by saying things that sound like I love you

26:20.640 --> 26:22.320
and see if you like how it feels.

26:22.320 --> 26:23.520
Elephant shoes?

26:23.520 --> 26:28.720
Or maybe like, even step, step back even further from that and be like, Danny Glover.

26:29.440 --> 26:33.280
And then see if, see how that treats you sonically.

26:33.280 --> 26:35.200
If it's sonic, if it, if it is the rumor.

26:35.200 --> 26:36.480
Is it your rumors?

26:36.480 --> 26:39.520
If it's your rumors of talk of words that you've shared.

26:39.520 --> 26:41.280
Saying I love you is my rumors.

26:41.280 --> 26:44.080
Hey guys, I'm, I don't say this enough.

26:44.080 --> 26:49.120
And I want you to know, I really, I don't want to bring things down, but I really do mean it.

26:49.920 --> 26:51.040
Danny Glover, you both.

26:52.240 --> 26:52.960
Thank you, Griffin.

26:52.960 --> 26:54.000
Danny Glover, you too.

26:54.000 --> 26:55.440
Danny Glover, you too, Griffin.

26:56.800 --> 26:58.080
Danny Glover, everyone.

26:58.080 --> 26:59.920
Guys, I do not Danny Glove that joke.

27:02.160 --> 27:02.720
Me neither.

27:02.720 --> 27:05.440
I'm not, I'm, I maybe Donald Glover it.

27:05.440 --> 27:05.680
Yeah.

27:05.680 --> 27:06.560
I don't, I don't.

27:06.560 --> 27:07.280
Unrelated.

27:07.280 --> 27:08.080
Can you believe it?

27:08.080 --> 27:09.120
Can you believe it?

27:09.120 --> 27:11.840
Now, wait, hold the phone.

27:11.840 --> 27:13.680
I know how you're going to, I know how you're going to spin this.

27:13.680 --> 27:14.560
But that's not what I meant.

27:14.560 --> 27:16.640
No, no spinning required.

27:16.640 --> 27:18.480
Just shove it a little bit forward.

27:20.720 --> 27:21.840
Wait, what are we talking about?

27:23.120 --> 27:28.000
Travis just said that everyone, he says that all black Glovers should be related.

27:28.640 --> 27:30.240
I don't think that, I don't think.

27:30.240 --> 27:31.840
I did not say should be.

27:31.840 --> 27:33.600
I assume it's Hollywood.

27:33.600 --> 27:34.720
I assume nepotism.

27:34.720 --> 27:36.240
That's the only reason I thought it was weird.

27:36.240 --> 27:37.760
That's exactly what it was.

27:37.760 --> 27:38.080
Okay.

27:40.080 --> 27:40.400
Okay.

27:40.400 --> 27:43.440
When I found out Adam Baldwin wasn't related to the Baldwins, I was surprised.

27:43.440 --> 27:44.000
Thank you.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.200
Was I racist?

27:45.200 --> 27:47.040
That's a great, thank you, Travis.

27:47.040 --> 27:48.240
Yes, that is a fine point.

27:48.240 --> 27:49.280
That's not racist.

27:49.280 --> 27:51.760
But the Baldwins have a history of nepotism.

27:52.320 --> 27:56.320
Danny Glover, Danny Glover's worked hard to get where he is.

27:56.320 --> 27:57.680
And so has Donald Glover.

27:59.920 --> 28:00.960
That's all I'm saying.

28:00.960 --> 28:04.080
The only thing I, listen, you don't have, we don't have to fight about this.

28:04.080 --> 28:06.560
The only thing I'm saying is that you're a horrid racist.

28:06.560 --> 28:07.760
I am not a horrid racist.

28:07.760 --> 28:11.920
And on the off chance that Donald Glover hears this bit, I want him to know how much I respect

28:11.920 --> 28:12.480
him deeply.

28:13.280 --> 28:14.240
Well, fuck that guy.

28:14.240 --> 28:14.720
You know what?

28:14.720 --> 28:17.200
You know, there's only one God I serve.

28:17.200 --> 28:18.080
Who's that?

28:18.080 --> 28:18.640
Money.

28:18.640 --> 28:19.520
I love him.

28:19.520 --> 28:20.880
Danny Glover him so much.

28:31.120 --> 28:33.120
I want to talk about Origins of State.

28:33.840 --> 28:36.480
Origins of State is a performance company in Brooklyn.

28:36.480 --> 28:44.080
They are holding a ritual dinner, a dinner ritual based on the Passover cedar about the

28:44.080 --> 28:45.360
story of America.

28:46.000 --> 28:49.520
And that runs before and after the weekend at Max Fun Con East.

28:49.520 --> 28:56.400
You can dine and remake America from the company Jesse Torn once dubbed the quote greatest

28:56.400 --> 28:59.760
theatrical experience of all time.

29:00.720 --> 29:03.600
Now seating is, I know seating is super limited.

29:03.600 --> 29:06.800
They have nine seats per night.

29:06.800 --> 29:11.040
Jesus, I have but I've got I've got nine friends and I want to go.

29:11.760 --> 29:13.760
You can't go to kill one of your friends.

29:14.320 --> 29:15.440
Yeah, there is.

29:15.440 --> 29:17.040
Yeah, there's nine seats at the table per night.

29:17.040 --> 29:21.920
So it's it is basically the most limited seating there can be.

29:21.920 --> 29:23.680
But it looks let's change that.

29:23.680 --> 29:25.760
Let's change that word to exclusive.

29:25.760 --> 29:26.800
Oh, I like that.

29:26.800 --> 29:31.040
And while we're changing inclusive say there while we're changing things, let's go back

29:31.040 --> 29:35.120
to when Justin said Cedar and let's change it to the correct pronunciation.

29:36.320 --> 29:39.440
Cedar Cedar is a delicious smelling wood.

29:40.400 --> 29:45.200
Cedar is like a super it's like a super delicious religious dinner.

29:45.920 --> 29:47.040
Is it Cedar?

29:47.040 --> 29:48.160
It's Cedar.

29:49.040 --> 29:50.480
Cedar is the wood.

29:50.480 --> 29:59.680
Yes, the greatest theatrical experience of all time and the basically also the best wood

29:59.680 --> 30:03.520
have finally joined to present the wood.

30:05.200 --> 30:05.840
I take that back.

30:05.840 --> 30:08.640
The table might be what the chairs might be what I don't want to assume.

30:08.640 --> 30:09.840
There you go, dipshit.

30:11.920 --> 30:17.120
So go to you want to go to tickets dot organs of state.

30:17.120 --> 30:22.880
That's O-R-G-A-N-S-O-F-S-T-A-T-E dot org.

30:23.520 --> 30:26.800
And and look into that because it sounds fascinating.

30:26.800 --> 30:28.720
It sounds like something I'd love to go to.

30:28.720 --> 30:32.480
If you're anywhere in the Brooklyn area, you're going to want to check that out.

30:33.280 --> 30:38.480
You sound like a real student of Hebrew traditions.

30:38.480 --> 30:39.520
Yeah, all right.

30:39.520 --> 30:45.360
Just for the record, by the way, that's October 19th, 20th, 21st, 25th, 26th, 27th, 28th,

30:46.000 --> 30:47.600
and then November 1st to the 4th.

30:47.600 --> 30:50.480
So there's a lot of opportunities to see it.

30:50.480 --> 30:51.280
Don't miss it.

30:51.280 --> 30:54.080
Don't pass this one over this event.

30:54.080 --> 30:54.880
Fuck.

30:54.880 --> 30:55.280
Got it.

30:55.840 --> 30:56.320
Nailed it.

30:56.320 --> 31:01.440
And for Henry from Alyssa, we have some goodwill to you.

31:01.440 --> 31:03.040
Henry's a wonderful boyfriend.

31:03.040 --> 31:08.160
He introduced Alyssa to my bim bam and everything else worth knowing,

31:08.160 --> 31:10.480
including one presumes his body.

31:11.040 --> 31:14.160
He is sassy and smart and attractive.

31:14.160 --> 31:20.000
And all he asked for as a birthday gift was a message on this very Jumbotron.

31:20.000 --> 31:20.960
Don't worry.

31:20.960 --> 31:22.640
I got him extra things anyway.

31:22.640 --> 31:24.000
And some of them are sexy.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.640
Oh, I love you, Henry.

31:26.640 --> 31:27.360
Gravel?

31:27.360 --> 31:27.840
Graveal?

31:28.560 --> 31:29.360
Greenville?

31:29.360 --> 31:30.880
It's actually pronounced Sater.

31:30.880 --> 31:31.760
Sater!

31:31.760 --> 31:32.880
Happy birthday.

31:32.880 --> 31:38.560
Justin, in all the time, 124 episodes, I have never been made sad by a thing you said

31:38.560 --> 31:40.160
until you said his body.

31:41.120 --> 31:42.160
Then I was made sad.

31:42.160 --> 31:43.760
That was your thing, huh?

31:43.760 --> 31:45.280
That was the one thing that Griffin-

31:45.280 --> 31:47.280
It was the tone of voice that you had said it in

31:48.080 --> 31:50.640
and the way that you took this wonderful birthday message

31:50.640 --> 31:54.160
and spun it into what's the opposite of gold?

31:54.160 --> 31:55.920
You spun it into evil crap.

31:55.920 --> 31:59.760
I truly am surprised that we managed to take something sweet and innocent

31:59.760 --> 32:02.000
and then corrupt it into something bad.

32:02.000 --> 32:03.680
Yeah, it's a first ever.

32:03.680 --> 32:04.720
It's a first ever.

32:04.720 --> 32:05.680
Oh, no, wait.

32:05.680 --> 32:09.840
We're a fucking conveyor belt that goes through a cardboard box

32:09.840 --> 32:11.920
and the cardboard box is bad on it.

32:11.920 --> 32:16.240
And then there's a special robot there and he's got a shaker

32:16.240 --> 32:19.840
and inside that shaker is concentrated bad and he puts it on there.

32:19.840 --> 32:22.480
Let's not ruin Mark Little's message in the same way.

32:22.480 --> 32:22.960
Okay.

32:22.960 --> 32:24.640
Griffin, hit me, damn it.

32:24.640 --> 32:25.920
Okay, fuck.

32:25.920 --> 32:29.520
This one's for Mark Little from Eric Harmony and Rebecca who say,

32:29.520 --> 32:30.800
happy birthday.

32:30.800 --> 32:33.840
This isn't as good as a jet pack, but we hope it will do.

32:33.840 --> 32:37.680
We love you tons from your brother, your wife, and your sister-in-law.

32:38.960 --> 32:41.280
Wait, who says this isn't as good as a jet pack?

32:42.480 --> 32:46.800
I'm tired of people downplaying the importance of the Jumbotron as a gift.

32:46.800 --> 32:49.440
First, Alyssa went and got Henry other things,

32:49.440 --> 32:51.440
which, how do you think that makes us feel?

32:52.160 --> 32:52.960
You know?

32:52.960 --> 32:54.240
Pretty, pretty good.

32:54.240 --> 32:54.960
Well, we can't-

32:54.960 --> 32:57.040
Thank you for getting him material goods.

32:57.040 --> 32:58.800
Let's, well, it may, it's sexy.

32:59.680 --> 33:00.000
You know what I mean?

33:00.000 --> 33:01.520
It's also good for the economy.

33:01.520 --> 33:02.720
We can't give him that.

33:02.720 --> 33:03.200
We can't.

33:04.000 --> 33:05.600
I can't be that for you, Henry.

33:05.600 --> 33:09.440
We can't, you know, we can't grab Rod Stewart and never let go.

33:09.440 --> 33:10.400
You know what I mean?

33:10.400 --> 33:12.400
Rod Stewart is the name of his penis.

33:12.400 --> 33:15.360
When I buy sexy things, you know where I turn?

33:15.360 --> 33:17.120
Did you guess Extreme Machines.com?

33:17.120 --> 33:20.480
Well, if you've listened to this show at any point for the past two months,

33:20.480 --> 33:22.640
I bet you did guess Extreme Machines.com.

33:22.640 --> 33:27.040
You probably saw that segue coming, felt it in your way down deep.

33:27.040 --> 33:29.200
You might have said it along with it.

33:29.200 --> 33:30.320
Yeah, you probably, yeah.

33:30.320 --> 33:32.720
It's like a, it's like a romper room bit at this point.

33:32.720 --> 33:35.360
You're just, the kids at home are shouting along with you.

33:35.920 --> 33:37.840
Go to Extreme Machines!

33:37.840 --> 33:38.640
That's right, kids.

33:38.640 --> 33:40.160
Coupon Code Middle East!

33:41.920 --> 33:45.600
There is nothing that makes me happier than the fact that our show is now,

33:45.600 --> 33:48.640
I, how do I put, synonymous?

33:48.640 --> 33:51.520
Is that, is that overstating the point?

33:51.520 --> 33:53.600
It's definitely a symbiotic relationship.

33:53.600 --> 33:54.800
You may be hearing this thinking,

33:54.800 --> 33:57.280
I already bought a dildo from Extreme Restraints.

33:57.280 --> 34:00.000
Why don't you go buy another one and then you got Lummi Stix?

34:03.680 --> 34:05.120
Oh, God bless.

34:05.680 --> 34:08.080
You know, if you want to treat your cyborg right,

34:08.640 --> 34:14.960
I just, I'd entreat you to go to the Electro Sex Gear section of the site.

34:14.960 --> 34:17.600
They got that Zeus Electro Sex Torpedo Plug.

34:17.600 --> 34:19.760
They got the Zeus Electro Sex Clamps.

34:19.760 --> 34:22.400
I don't want to make a mountain out of a molehill, Justin,

34:22.400 --> 34:25.920
but for the past, I would say three episodes, maybe more,

34:25.920 --> 34:28.800
whenever you have to turn to anecdotal sex toy,

34:29.440 --> 34:32.800
suggests you always go to electricity.

34:33.520 --> 34:34.240
It's very-

34:34.240 --> 34:35.280
You got a Tesla thing?

34:35.840 --> 34:36.160
Yeah.

34:36.880 --> 34:39.840
Yeah, I guess I just get a charge out of it.

34:39.840 --> 34:42.400
Oh no, why is this show so bad?

34:42.400 --> 34:49.760
When you do things, do you like alternating or direct current?

34:51.760 --> 34:53.760
This show is so bad, it's shocking.

34:54.560 --> 34:57.680
Holy fuck, can we stop the shallotry?

34:57.680 --> 34:59.600
Can we put the shallotry to bed?

35:01.440 --> 35:06.480
I actually used inferior sexual electric toys

35:06.480 --> 35:09.600
to shock pets in my neighborhood

35:09.600 --> 35:12.800
and killed them to show how dangerous they were.

35:12.800 --> 35:14.240
Oh, okay, for a second there,

35:14.240 --> 35:17.040
I thought this was like a fun story from your childhood.

35:17.600 --> 35:21.040
No, it was a reference to something that Edison did

35:21.040 --> 35:21.920
because he was a creep.

35:21.920 --> 35:22.720
He's a cock.

35:23.440 --> 35:26.640
Yeah, don't shock the local kitty cats.

35:28.000 --> 35:29.680
What you do is you shock the monkey.

35:29.680 --> 35:30.960
Shock the pussy.

35:30.960 --> 35:33.040
No, wait, yes.

35:33.040 --> 35:34.960
Shock the pussy, come on now.

35:34.960 --> 35:36.880
You should do that, but not in that tone of voice.

35:36.880 --> 35:38.080
Shock the pussy!

35:38.080 --> 35:40.880
Justin is gonna single-handedly take that word back

35:40.880 --> 35:42.800
from whom I do not know,

35:42.800 --> 35:44.480
but when he does it, he's gonna be armed

35:44.480 --> 35:45.360
with that pronunciation.

35:45.360 --> 35:46.800
I don't know who has pussy.

35:47.360 --> 35:49.200
I need to go to the copyright office.

35:49.200 --> 35:51.600
Now when you say it like that, it makes me uncomfortable.

35:51.600 --> 35:52.640
Pussy.

35:52.640 --> 35:55.520
When you add like an O or two into the word.

35:55.520 --> 36:11.440
It sounded like you were playing some sort of pussy theremin.

36:20.240 --> 36:22.800
Fucking say the link right!

36:22.800 --> 36:26.320
Fuck with the giant rubber electric dildo.

36:27.680 --> 36:31.200
Extremestraints.com forward slash nothing.

36:31.760 --> 36:34.000
And then the coupon code MIDDLIST.

36:34.000 --> 36:34.880
Use that at checkout.

36:34.880 --> 36:35.680
You're gonna save 20%.

36:36.480 --> 36:36.960
There it is.

36:37.600 --> 36:38.960
Explode your pussy.

36:38.960 --> 36:40.000
Explode your pussy.

36:40.000 --> 36:41.200
Do yourself a favor.

36:41.200 --> 36:42.000
With the power of Zeus.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.040
Explode your pussy.

36:45.920 --> 36:49.920
And don't forget to go to maximumfun.org forward slash maxfunday

36:49.920 --> 36:52.800
right now when you're having this much fun.

36:52.800 --> 36:56.160
Where else can you hear the word pussy 5,000 times in 10 minutes?

36:56.160 --> 36:58.480
It'll explode your pussy in another way.

36:58.480 --> 36:59.600
A more altruistic way.

36:59.600 --> 37:00.800
Your mental pussy.

37:00.800 --> 37:03.840
Did we mention that every $10 and $20 new donor,

37:03.840 --> 37:07.760
they're gonna give food for enough food for 20 meals

37:07.760 --> 37:10.000
at the local Los Angeles food bank.

37:10.000 --> 37:10.800
Did you know that?

37:10.800 --> 37:12.000
I bet you didn't know that.

37:12.720 --> 37:14.240
Go explode your pussy.

37:14.240 --> 37:16.240
It's not all about pussies and dildos, you guys.

37:16.240 --> 37:17.360
It's about helping people.

37:17.360 --> 37:21.280
If my donation's going to the Los Angeles food bank,

37:21.280 --> 37:24.080
there is a good chance that Harlan Williams

37:24.080 --> 37:27.280
is gonna be eating off of your generosity tonight.

37:28.400 --> 37:30.000
And Griffin Ozen big.

37:30.000 --> 37:34.160
Hey, my pregnant wife just ate 18 bagel bites for lunch.

37:34.160 --> 37:36.240
Should I be concerned about how this will affect her

37:36.240 --> 37:37.360
and my unborn child?

37:38.880 --> 37:41.200
That's from pizza blasted in the peach state.

37:42.320 --> 37:42.960
Oh no.

37:45.200 --> 37:46.000
Honey?

37:46.000 --> 37:46.720
Honey?

37:46.720 --> 37:47.600
Should you stop?

37:47.600 --> 37:48.240
Okay, okay, okay.

37:48.240 --> 37:50.560
Were some of those supposed to be for me?

37:50.560 --> 37:51.920
Did I miss my window?

37:51.920 --> 37:54.800
Do you think that this is the person's real protest?

37:54.800 --> 37:58.400
Baby, should you have heated those first?

38:00.480 --> 38:02.080
Your teeth are broken.

38:02.080 --> 38:05.200
Is it bad that when I heard you read that,

38:05.200 --> 38:10.720
the first thing I thought of was the little pizza bites.

38:11.920 --> 38:12.880
Pizza rolls.

38:12.880 --> 38:13.600
Pizza rolls.

38:13.600 --> 38:16.480
That's what I initially thought of and I got yucked out.

38:16.480 --> 38:18.000
But then when I made the realization

38:18.000 --> 38:19.680
that we're talking about bagel bites here,

38:19.680 --> 38:20.800
I was like, well, okay.

38:21.680 --> 38:25.600
Well, the reason is because the bagel bites are so flexible.

38:25.600 --> 38:26.640
Hold on, hold on everybody.

38:26.640 --> 38:30.320
Justin's singing the pizza, the pizza bagels song.

38:30.320 --> 38:30.960
Let me try again.

38:30.960 --> 38:32.800
Do you want to do it in chorus, Justin?

38:32.800 --> 38:33.200
Yeah, yeah.

38:33.200 --> 38:34.800
We'll just start and we'll do harmony.

38:34.800 --> 38:37.600
Justin just decided that he wants a good eight seconds

38:37.600 --> 38:39.520
of the show where nothing funny happens.

38:39.520 --> 38:39.840
Go on.

38:39.840 --> 38:40.640
You ready?

38:40.640 --> 38:41.440
All right.

38:41.440 --> 38:43.200
I don't call him daddy.

38:43.840 --> 38:45.520
He didn't scare me.

38:45.520 --> 38:47.920
When you pick me up on Friday,

38:47.920 --> 38:50.000
are you going to bring me bagel bites?

38:50.560 --> 38:51.920
Oh, don't worry.

38:51.920 --> 38:54.400
Dad, you know, it don't matter which flavor.

38:55.280 --> 38:59.840
I don't call daddy because he doesn't have bagel bites.

38:59.840 --> 39:00.480
Okay.

39:00.480 --> 39:00.880
I love.

39:01.840 --> 39:03.920
There definitely needs to be a version of that song

39:03.920 --> 39:06.880
where his allegiances change so quickly

39:06.880 --> 39:10.160
based on which hand is feeding bagel bites down his throat.

39:10.720 --> 39:12.960
It could be even more mundane things.

39:12.960 --> 39:15.040
I don't call daddy.

39:15.040 --> 39:16.560
He didn't take me to the mall.

39:17.120 --> 39:18.880
What you saying earlier?

39:18.880 --> 39:20.880
You wanted to go to the mall.

39:21.680 --> 39:23.440
I don't call him daddy.

39:23.440 --> 39:26.000
But if you don't get me some fun dip, I'm gone now.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.160
And I'm going to start calling you Jeff.

39:32.240 --> 39:34.000
Do you want to be demoted to Jeff?

39:34.000 --> 39:35.920
Do you want to be fun dip Jeff?

39:40.400 --> 39:42.240
You guys know that every country music song

39:42.240 --> 39:45.440
has to have the word twang in it somewhere.

39:45.440 --> 39:49.280
I don't call him daddy, but I could sure use a sugar glider.

39:50.720 --> 39:52.560
They're like mice, but they can fly.

39:53.280 --> 39:54.960
And they really need all your love.

39:56.480 --> 39:59.360
Sugar gliders will die if you don't pet them every 30 seconds.

39:59.360 --> 40:00.240
Did you guys know that?

40:00.240 --> 40:04.000
That was told to me by a man at the West Virginia Pumpkin Festival today.

40:04.000 --> 40:05.760
They're selling sugar gliders for $400.

40:06.320 --> 40:07.520
Fuck, that's a lot of money.

40:07.520 --> 40:10.240
That seems like a weird impulse buy at the Pumpkin Festival.

40:10.240 --> 40:11.120
Thank you, Travis.

40:11.120 --> 40:12.800
That is specifically what I said.

40:13.520 --> 40:14.160
Thank you.

40:14.160 --> 40:14.560
You didn't-

40:14.560 --> 40:15.440
You just walked into the Pumpkin Festival like,

40:15.440 --> 40:17.040
ooh, jar of pumpkin butter.

40:17.040 --> 40:19.520
Oh, okay, I can get that little scarecrow, man.

40:19.520 --> 40:21.200
Ooh, $400 sugar glider.

40:21.200 --> 40:24.000
I just happen to have $400 cash in my pocket.

40:24.000 --> 40:26.960
Because if there's anything I know about Justin

40:26.960 --> 40:29.600
and his reaction to small animals

40:29.600 --> 40:31.360
that shouldn't be in places where they are,

40:31.920 --> 40:34.240
your initial reaction when you look at a rat is,

40:34.240 --> 40:36.000
man, I wish that thing could get airborne.

40:37.120 --> 40:38.960
Let's just get that up in the sky.

40:38.960 --> 40:42.000
Can I get you closer to my line of sight?

40:42.000 --> 40:44.720
Can I get you up in my eyes and face region?

40:45.280 --> 40:46.800
That would treat me so right.

40:46.800 --> 40:47.920
If you could just do that for me.

40:50.080 --> 40:51.200
You bought it, right?

40:51.200 --> 40:52.160
I bought four.

40:52.160 --> 40:53.120
They're gonna be a family.

40:54.640 --> 40:55.520
They can pet each other,

40:55.520 --> 40:57.040
keep each other alive through the winter.

40:58.080 --> 41:00.560
Alvin and the Chipmunks and his other stupid brother

41:00.560 --> 41:01.520
ain't got nothing on me.

41:01.520 --> 41:03.040
I got four sugar gliders.

41:03.040 --> 41:04.320
They run in a circle and shit.

41:04.320 --> 41:05.120
Wait, hold on, hold on.

41:05.680 --> 41:06.960
What other stupid brother?

41:07.600 --> 41:08.160
What?

41:08.160 --> 41:10.320
Well, no, because I bought four.

41:10.320 --> 41:11.040
There's only three.

41:11.840 --> 41:12.880
I bought four gliders.

41:12.880 --> 41:13.920
There's three Chipmunks.

41:13.920 --> 41:16.400
So they gotta get a fourth one to even get in the game with me.

41:17.600 --> 41:21.200
They gotta recruit a non-singing, like, regular Chipmunk.

41:21.840 --> 41:24.560
This is our brother, Steven the Chipmunk,

41:24.560 --> 41:26.720
and he just does all of our electric work.

41:27.600 --> 41:29.520
The Chipmunk version of bonus Jonas.

41:32.080 --> 41:33.040
Oh, bonus Jonas.

41:33.040 --> 41:34.160
I hope he's doing okay.

41:34.160 --> 41:35.680
I haven't heard about him in a while.

41:35.680 --> 41:36.480
Yeah, exactly.

41:36.480 --> 41:37.600
You wanna Yahoo?

41:37.600 --> 41:38.100
Please.

41:42.320 --> 41:43.680
That's your cue to do that.

41:43.680 --> 41:45.280
Yeah, maybe we shouldn't.

41:45.280 --> 41:46.800
This one was sent in by JP Grant.

41:46.800 --> 41:47.760
Thanks, JP Grant.

41:48.880 --> 41:51.120
It's almost identical to the last question.

41:51.920 --> 41:52.420
Okay.

41:53.360 --> 41:54.240
Theme show.

41:54.240 --> 41:54.560
I hate-

41:55.600 --> 41:57.520
It's by Alvin and his user, Devin, who asked,

41:57.520 --> 42:00.400
I hate my life because I just ate 17 bowls of oatmeal.

42:00.400 --> 42:01.200
What should I do?

42:01.200 --> 42:09.920
It's actionable, this advice, because it's direct questions.

42:09.920 --> 42:12.480
If the wife had said, I just ate 18 bagel bites.

42:13.200 --> 42:14.240
What's my next step?

42:14.240 --> 42:17.040
What's, yeah, what's my next thing?

42:17.040 --> 42:21.520
This guy, he done did it already, and he needs to know where to turn.

42:21.520 --> 42:23.200
He adds, I thought it would be fun.

42:23.200 --> 42:24.720
Now I just hurt everywhere.

42:24.720 --> 42:25.280
Please help.

42:25.280 --> 42:25.600
What?

42:26.400 --> 42:26.900
What?

42:26.900 --> 42:32.500
Wait, I think, I know how, can you imagine how those last few bites must have felt?

42:32.500 --> 42:33.540
Just slopping it in.

42:33.540 --> 42:34.660
This wasn't fun at all.

42:34.660 --> 42:35.700
What have I done?

42:35.700 --> 42:40.820
I imagine from bowl eight on, it was like that scene in Matilda.

42:41.380 --> 42:41.940
Yeah, right.

42:42.820 --> 42:44.420
With no kids chanting.

42:44.420 --> 42:46.500
No kids are chanting for you to eat the cake.

42:47.540 --> 42:50.980
The horrifying cake the old woman put her blood in, I think.

42:50.980 --> 42:56.500
Now for real, you guys, this, what we're seeing here is the direct negative influence

42:56.500 --> 42:58.260
that is man versus food.

42:58.820 --> 43:00.660
You think this is a man versus food?

43:00.660 --> 43:04.980
Oh, people aren't really making their own MVF challenges at home.

43:04.980 --> 43:09.460
All the kids, they watch the man versus food, and they just think it looks so cool,

43:09.460 --> 43:10.500
and they think, why not me?

43:11.300 --> 43:16.340
This week on Dale versus food, I'm gonna eat all my DVDs.

43:17.780 --> 43:18.980
And that's how people die.

43:19.540 --> 43:20.040
Yeah.

43:20.500 --> 43:22.100
That's not the only way people die.

43:22.100 --> 43:22.740
That's it.

43:22.740 --> 43:23.220
It's the number one cause.

43:23.220 --> 43:25.940
Until now, death had never been introduced into the cosmos.

43:25.940 --> 43:27.460
It's the number one cause.

43:27.460 --> 43:30.580
It's the number one cause of death among men named Dale.

43:36.580 --> 43:38.100
I have never been tempted.

43:38.100 --> 43:41.940
I don't call him Dale, because everybody I know named Dale is dead.

43:43.140 --> 43:45.140
They ate something in their house.

43:45.140 --> 43:46.580
It wasn't technically food.

43:47.140 --> 43:52.820
How bored do you have to be to look at a table with oatmeal on it and be like,

43:52.820 --> 43:54.260
yeah, this is gonna be fun.

43:54.260 --> 43:55.300
Yeah, here we go.

43:55.300 --> 43:55.860
Buckle up.

43:55.860 --> 43:56.900
This is what I'm doing today.

43:57.540 --> 44:02.580
I do want to make a point though about, I wouldn't eat 17 bowls of oatmeal,

44:02.580 --> 44:08.100
but can we just agree that those packets, the suggested surfing sizes-

44:08.100 --> 44:09.060
It's two at once.

44:09.060 --> 44:11.220
At least, at least two at once.

44:11.220 --> 44:12.580
You gotta do two, right?

44:12.580 --> 44:13.540
It's a joke.

44:13.540 --> 44:14.020
Yeah.

44:14.020 --> 44:15.700
If nobody eats that much oatmeal-

44:15.700 --> 44:16.420
It's three.

44:16.420 --> 44:17.620
It's a three packet day.

44:18.420 --> 44:18.660
Wow.

44:18.660 --> 44:22.020
I mean, super early, and it's like 5 AM, and I know I'm not gonna eat lunch till two.

44:22.020 --> 44:22.980
I need three packets.

44:22.980 --> 44:26.580
That third one's gonna kick in like the red logs and back to the future three,

44:26.580 --> 44:28.340
and it's gonna burst me through the day.

44:28.340 --> 44:29.060
I've managed to...

44:29.780 --> 44:32.500
I've actually cut back to one pack and a patch.

44:33.540 --> 44:35.460
I'm deeply impressed, Griffin.

44:35.460 --> 44:36.500
An oatmeal patch?

44:36.500 --> 44:37.380
Mm-hmm.

44:37.380 --> 44:39.620
Is Cream of Wheat oatmeal, technically?

44:39.620 --> 44:41.380
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

44:41.380 --> 44:46.020
It's actually, its technical, like its scientific Latin name is slor.

44:48.740 --> 44:50.100
It's technically what it is.

44:50.100 --> 44:53.300
Cream of Wheat is wheat, and oatmeal is oats.

44:53.300 --> 44:56.420
They're two different families, and they are both loved by horses.

44:56.420 --> 44:57.540
Where's Cocoa Wheats falling?

44:57.540 --> 45:00.340
Cocoa Wheats are fucking wallpaper paste.

45:00.340 --> 45:02.180
No, Cocoa Wheats, Cocoa Wheats can't be beat.

45:03.060 --> 45:05.140
How many more jingles can we do?

45:05.780 --> 45:08.900
Let's do 10 more jingles till the end of the show.

45:08.900 --> 45:22.420
Oh, worst review ever on the AV Club.

45:22.420 --> 45:24.100
They kept singing jingles.

45:24.100 --> 45:25.140
No stars.

45:25.140 --> 45:26.100
AV Club out.

45:33.220 --> 45:37.140
I don't call him daddy, because he brings me Cocoa Wheats.

45:37.140 --> 45:39.860
I don't even sell those anymore.

45:39.860 --> 45:41.620
It's like Bosco.

45:41.620 --> 45:43.620
That's not even a product that's for sale.

45:43.620 --> 45:45.540
They just accidentally left the commercials on.

45:47.700 --> 45:50.020
I saw Ovaltine at the store yesterday.

45:50.020 --> 45:53.460
I checked it to see if there was a picture of Ronald Reagan on it somewhere.

45:53.460 --> 45:54.260
Give me a thumbs up.

45:55.060 --> 45:56.020
I endorse this.

45:56.820 --> 45:58.180
I endorse this milk powder.

45:58.180 --> 45:59.620
Oh, you know, that's not half bad.

45:59.620 --> 46:02.100
I was going to say, that might be the best impression you've ever done on the show.

46:04.660 --> 46:05.700
Let's stop it.

46:05.700 --> 46:10.180
Maximumfun.org forward slash Max Fun Day.

46:10.740 --> 46:12.820
Come join our family.

46:12.820 --> 46:16.100
Help someone in need and get that bonus episode,

46:16.100 --> 46:19.300
because I bet after listening to this, what you're thinking is,

46:20.260 --> 46:22.980
God damn, I wish there was more of that.

46:22.980 --> 46:24.820
If it makes you feel it hurts, not just us,

46:24.820 --> 46:28.020
you'll get episodes from other Max Fun shows as well.

46:28.020 --> 46:31.060
Oh, yeah, but they might make sense.

46:31.060 --> 46:31.380
Yeah.

46:32.580 --> 46:35.460
Or not be covertly racist.

46:35.460 --> 46:37.060
So what's the point?

46:37.620 --> 46:39.140
Don't waste your megabits on that.

46:40.260 --> 46:43.060
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song.

46:43.060 --> 46:45.940
It's a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

46:47.380 --> 46:47.860
Thank you.

46:47.860 --> 46:49.860
Thank you for the gift of your music.

46:49.860 --> 46:50.900
Can we say that?

46:50.900 --> 46:52.020
Is it weird to say that?

46:52.580 --> 46:53.860
No, it's a beautiful gift.

46:53.860 --> 46:55.060
Thank you, Daddy, for your gift of music.

46:55.060 --> 46:55.460
Thanks.

46:55.460 --> 46:58.900
I don't call him Daddy, because he's any musician, John Roderick.

46:59.700 --> 47:02.740
But I do appreciate him loaning us his tune.

47:02.740 --> 47:04.900
Can we thank all the Twitters?

47:06.180 --> 47:08.660
Yeah, people have been tweeting about the show a lot lately.

47:08.660 --> 47:09.220
I think people-

47:09.220 --> 47:12.340
And by lately, you mean the two days that have passed since we last recorded the show.

47:12.340 --> 47:13.860
Oh, my God, I can't even think about it.

47:15.300 --> 47:21.620
I want to say thank you to our favorite fan.

47:21.620 --> 47:23.940
Well, our favorite fan this week, Lin-Manuel.

47:24.580 --> 47:27.140
Oh, you might know him as the Tony Award-winning musical producer.

47:27.140 --> 47:27.780
It's no big deal.

47:28.660 --> 47:30.180
Why are we bragging?

47:30.820 --> 47:31.220
What?

47:31.220 --> 47:32.740
Oh, I don't know, it's not a big deal.

47:32.740 --> 47:38.340
It's just like, you know, if Lin-Manuel Miranda just tweets a video at you that says,

47:38.340 --> 47:41.140
hey, you got to check this out, it's like, makes me feel pretty good.

47:41.140 --> 47:43.860
Which, by the way, was the coolest video I've ever seen.

47:43.860 --> 47:44.820
It was a really good video.

47:44.820 --> 47:45.540
The marching band?

47:46.100 --> 47:46.600
Yeah.

47:47.540 --> 47:48.500
So thanks to him.

47:48.500 --> 47:53.860
Thanks to King Mento, Mara Ruth, Indiana Matt, follow here or there, Logan Bonner,

47:55.060 --> 47:58.820
Chuck Jones, 1970 Wi-Fi Pirate, Josh Budd, Don Chapel,

47:58.820 --> 48:05.620
Note in Color, GameBeast23456, Koi Moore, and seriously, everybody,

48:05.620 --> 48:11.620
you guys are already always make us feel really, really nice and happy.

48:12.500 --> 48:18.580
Yeah, oh, Geeky Lindsey, of course, Chapman Cara, Meekintweet, everybody.

48:18.580 --> 48:21.940
I also want to say thanks to everyone that is already a Max Fund Donor.

48:21.940 --> 48:25.060
The content, the bonus content will also be available for you.

48:25.060 --> 48:27.700
We're glad you're in the family and make sure you take this opportunity

48:27.700 --> 48:31.060
to get all of your new friends and old friends into the family with you.

48:32.260 --> 48:35.300
You know, so even if you're already a donor, go ahead and tell everyone that,

48:35.300 --> 48:37.540
you know, you are a donor and they should be too.

48:37.540 --> 48:39.940
Thank you for your continued support and we love all of you.

48:42.340 --> 48:44.260
I had somebody I wanted to thank on Twitter.

48:45.300 --> 48:45.800
Oh.

48:46.580 --> 48:47.860
Personally, thanks.

48:47.860 --> 48:54.580
Oh, Daniel Corsetto, who's another webcomic artist that I'm a fan of,

48:54.580 --> 48:56.260
started listening to this show.

48:56.260 --> 48:58.900
We are joining the army of webcomic.

48:58.900 --> 49:00.900
Guys, why don't we just stop doing the show?

49:00.900 --> 49:02.100
Why are we even doing this?

49:02.100 --> 49:06.740
We can crowdsource all of our shit out to webcomic artists.

49:06.740 --> 49:10.900
And if somebody wants to do like an MBM webcomic, go for it.

49:10.900 --> 49:11.780
No theme.

49:11.780 --> 49:12.340
No, don't.

49:12.340 --> 49:14.420
They got to do like licensing deals.

49:14.420 --> 49:17.700
Oh, OK, so like license, whatever that means.

49:17.700 --> 49:18.260
License it.

49:18.260 --> 49:18.980
Get a license.

49:20.020 --> 49:22.740
OK, Travis, you're just you're just losing it.

49:23.380 --> 49:25.140
You're losing your mind right now, Travis.

49:25.140 --> 49:27.220
We're watching it.

49:27.220 --> 49:28.340
We're watching you lose it.

49:28.340 --> 49:29.540
You're losing it right now.

49:32.580 --> 49:37.700
This, all kidding aside, and I know we like to have some fun here,

49:37.700 --> 49:43.620
but it really does mean a lot to us that you guys listen to the show and support the show.

49:46.660 --> 49:51.540
I don't know, it just it makes me feel really good when people that are so cool,

49:51.540 --> 49:57.620
like Danielle Corsette or so many others, and even commenters who don't have a lot of followers,

49:58.500 --> 50:01.780
when you guys support our show and listen to our show week in and week out,

50:02.580 --> 50:04.260
it really does mean the world to us.

50:04.260 --> 50:06.420
And and we can't thank you enough.

50:06.420 --> 50:10.820
Thanks, you're the fucking coolest like community.

50:10.820 --> 50:11.700
You really are.

50:11.700 --> 50:15.460
And sometimes in this life, you need really cool people in your corner.

50:15.460 --> 50:16.740
And you guys are always that for us.

50:16.740 --> 50:18.180
So thank you so much for that.

50:18.180 --> 50:18.660
Thank you for that.

50:18.660 --> 50:20.180
We hope we can be that for you.

50:20.180 --> 50:22.100
But probably not.

50:22.100 --> 50:22.660
Probably not.

50:22.660 --> 50:24.580
This yahoo was sent in by Jeremy Shoble.

50:24.580 --> 50:25.140
Thanks, Jeremy.

50:25.140 --> 50:29.060
It's by yahoo answers you to Laura, who asks, where do wizards live?

50:31.620 --> 50:32.500
Just a McElroy.

50:32.500 --> 50:33.780
I'm Travis McElroy.

50:33.780 --> 50:35.300
I'm Griffin McElroy.

50:35.300 --> 50:36.020
This has been my brother.

50:36.020 --> 50:38.020
My brother may kiss your dad.

50:38.020 --> 50:39.460
Square on the lips.

50:39.460 --> 50:40.260
Keep your heart.

50:40.260 --> 50:41.140
Three stacks.

50:41.140 --> 50:42.180
Keep your heart.

50:42.180 --> 50:43.460
Hey, keep your heart.

50:43.460 --> 50:44.340
Three stacks.

50:44.340 --> 50:45.380
Keep your heart.

50:45.380 --> 50:46.660
Man, these girls smart.

50:46.660 --> 50:47.300
Three stacks.

50:47.300 --> 50:48.420
These girls smart.

50:48.420 --> 50:51.940
Before you know it, play your part.
