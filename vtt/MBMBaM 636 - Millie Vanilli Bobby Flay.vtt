WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

00:05.760 --> 00:10.580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

00:11.480 --> 00:17.660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

00:17.660 --> 00:30.660
What's up, you cool, baby?

00:48.420 --> 00:50.420
It's better, it's better with you

00:53.980 --> 00:55.980
It's better, it's better with you

01:00.300 --> 01:02.300
It's better, it's better with you

01:10.940 --> 01:15.920
Hey everybody, welcome to my brother my brother me an invite show for the Machinero. I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy

01:15.920 --> 01:21.400
I'm your middlest brother Travis McElroy. I am your sweet baby brother Griffin McElroy

01:21.400 --> 01:24.880
Justin's got the goggles out. I got the binoculars. This is my new thing

01:24.880 --> 01:29.440
I feel like Tom has been posting more videos on our tik-tok channel. Yeah

01:29.960 --> 01:31.960
We got a Richard sink up there on YouTube

01:33.560 --> 01:35.560
Does that

01:37.440 --> 01:43.320
But Tom's been doing more tik-tok so I feel like I should be it's McElroy family if you follow us on tik-tok

01:43.320 --> 01:47.240
He might win a big prize and the prize is entertainment

01:47.320 --> 01:53.560
Yeah, to be fair throwing that might in there is a big might because doing anything you might win a big prize

01:54.440 --> 01:58.080
You might win a $100 Dave and Buster's gift card

01:59.280 --> 02:03.480
For an unrelated reason. Yeah, not from us. Just like all things are connected kind of way

02:03.760 --> 02:09.440
so I'm trying to incorporate more visual elements and this one I came up with his like I'm looking in all our

02:09.440 --> 02:15.960
Friends that have joined us more something for kids. Okay, I guess here's what I'm saying. There could be visual elements for kids

02:17.280 --> 02:22.280
Elements for adults so it's a if the kids are watching on YouTube. They like it better. Yeah

02:22.280 --> 02:28.720
Do you understand so the one? Yeah, I will say that a majority of our audience still does live in the audio

02:29.440 --> 02:32.080
Space and so when we do these things

02:33.120 --> 02:38.300
They won't get that and they'll hate that and they'll either tell us they hate that which hurts my feelings

02:38.300 --> 02:41.340
Feelings or they'll stop listening and supporting us

02:41.980 --> 02:43.800
fungibly and that hurts

02:43.800 --> 02:48.420
What? Okay, Justin has found us adding some marbles. Is that what that is? Is that a little mark?

02:48.420 --> 02:50.420
I have these clips in a bag

02:51.300 --> 02:57.660
The audio elements are for adults. Okay, then just watch it on mute. So it's got to be stimulating for kids

02:57.660 --> 03:04.940
Okay, if I may what we need is a visual like maybe mascot character or somebody who pops up that we do not reference

03:04.940 --> 03:09.420
But it's just like in like the corner of videos, right a little fun

03:10.460 --> 03:16.220
Now Justin's talking to his guitar clip. It's his capo. Yeah, but Travis you don't mention it. That's the thing

03:16.220 --> 03:22.360
That's the challenge Travis is that we do the can we maybe mayor? This is mayor capo

03:23.060 --> 03:25.140
mayor of music bird fucking go

03:25.860 --> 03:28.900
He's the mayor of music burg. He's a kids love

03:28.900 --> 03:34.340
The capo character mayor capo. Yeah, I think he's he's upside down for the way

03:34.340 --> 03:38.800
I think he should be shaped as a character. Here's the okay, you're not wrong, but I can't squeeze

03:40.900 --> 03:42.900
Maybe we flip it because

03:44.100 --> 03:45.740
adults

03:45.740 --> 03:52.920
the left side of their brain is the visual cortex and they like they like that and but kids like to have a

03:53.340 --> 03:56.760
imagination so they maybe we should do the audio for kids and

03:56.760 --> 03:58.560
and the

03:58.560 --> 04:01.840
Grown-ups get the video so it can be like hey

04:01.840 --> 04:07.520
Why did the cow go to on a where the cow go on a Friday night to the movies?

04:08.240 --> 04:13.680
That's pretty good. My with my hands. I'm doing a pork in it gesture. That's right. Do you know what I mean?

04:13.840 --> 04:16.700
Yeah, what do you call a fish with no eyes?

04:17.840 --> 04:23.920
And then I'm still doing the pork in it gesture. Well, here's the problem with these visual elements. What's wrong trap?

04:23.920 --> 04:30.120
They're very distracting for me. Hmm. Yeah, because I can't stop looking at what Justin's doing

04:30.280 --> 04:36.680
Yeah, and trying to figure out exactly what he's going for. He's a real sourpuss. I've got a terminal case of the grumpies

04:36.760 --> 04:38.760
Yeah, a terminal case

04:41.960 --> 04:45.840
Kids know that that means they have exactly 15 minutes to save me before I

04:46.200 --> 04:50.160
Yeah, and so they have to send money in they have to send money

04:50.160 --> 04:56.680
And buy our merch join the max fun network then buy our merch at Walmart and Target and get our new meal delivery

04:56.920 --> 04:58.800
We have our own pop-up kitchen

04:58.800 --> 05:04.200
It's called Mackle snacks and that's use on you can get that on all your favorite apps kids

05:04.200 --> 05:11.840
And the Mackle snacks aren't very good and they are it's like $15 for like a girl can open their own ghost kitchen

05:11.840 --> 05:18.340
Why yeah, I have noticed that we don't do enough BB likes the videos. It's like we're this family's

05:18.340 --> 05:23.340
Like promoting themselves to earn money and shilling out to YouTube and we're gonna all sleep

05:23.340 --> 05:25.540
Don't you hate when families promote themselves?

05:25.540 --> 05:30.980
I know right isn't the worst we're gonna we're gonna sleep in a bouncy castle inside the house tonight

05:30.980 --> 05:36.180
And then BBO trying to like can we sleep in a bouncy castle and I have to try to explain to her like that's not

05:36.180 --> 05:41.420
A real thing that people do that's the thing they're doing for this fun YouTube. This is not an option

05:41.420 --> 05:47.940
Normally good converting our living room into a like a ball pit is not a thing

05:48.500 --> 05:53.380
It's not a thing. That's not a thing people Charlie asked me if we could do it eat only orange food challenge

05:53.380 --> 05:59.140
And I said kid you you're already doing daily food challenges. It's called the eat only bread challenge

05:59.140 --> 06:05.680
Yeah, and then cry if you don't I do that try to get my kid to eat a good variety challenge every day so far

06:05.680 --> 06:12.080
Uh, the hit rate is low. Hey, this is an advice show. We're giving you freebies right now

06:12.080 --> 06:17.400
No, even ask for our pairing advice or just dumping it right on your lap. Yeah. Oh, okay

06:18.880 --> 06:23.680
No one should ask for our parenting advice, by the way, I mean, I'm not saying we're bad parents

06:23.680 --> 06:29.320
But I'm my kid is there's no way that it's a normal like the thing that I'm going to just

06:29.680 --> 06:33.360
She sometimes turns into a gargoyle at night. It's not important. Don't worry about it guys

06:33.360 --> 06:34.840
You

06:34.840 --> 06:41.360
Guys remember that show gargoyles. I got to real that got to my girlfriend recently proposed to me by setting up a beach picnic

06:41.360 --> 06:43.360
Oh

06:43.920 --> 06:48.760
Both move a beach picnic because with too much wind that's all yeah to me

06:48.760 --> 06:50.840
It's one of my favorite favorite foods

06:51.600 --> 06:54.140
Including a butternut squash pasta dish

06:54.800 --> 07:00.000
Since she did not have access to the recipe. I usually use she ended up improvising

07:00.000 --> 07:05.600
Oh boy and researching an entirely different recipe. The problem is I actively dislike this recipe. Oh, man

07:06.520 --> 07:10.280
Obviously, I wasn't gonna say anything is I don't want to hurt her feelings or ruin the thought you put in our proposal

07:10.280 --> 07:13.480
But now she wants to include the pasta dish in our daily rotation of recipes

07:13.480 --> 07:19.400
And I don't know how to sidestep it without admitting. I never liked the engagement pasta. Oh boy

07:19.920 --> 07:23.760
Engagement pasta sounds like something a social media ninja would be would be yeah

07:23.760 --> 07:29.960
Sure, people bro the SEO the engagement pasta on this tweet. It's pretty low need more J pegs

07:30.400 --> 07:37.160
Hey Olive Garden, it's me Doug your social media manager. Let me I have a suggestion for you. It's called engagement pasta

07:37.160 --> 07:40.120
You're gonna finally raise them in brothers. What do I do?

07:40.120 --> 07:46.800
Do I admit I don't like our engagement pasta and risk putting a cloud over what was a very thoughtful and amazing proposal or do?

07:46.800 --> 07:49.640
I resign myself to eating mediocre and post my posture pop

07:50.800 --> 07:51.880
jerk

07:51.880 --> 07:57.780
Impostor pasta. Thank you for the rest of my life. That's from pasta prisoner in South Carolina

07:59.680 --> 08:01.680
What do you think of this move

08:01.840 --> 08:06.840
The next time they make it say hi. Did you do something different this time?

08:06.960 --> 08:12.240
It doesn't taste the same and and then try to do like the maybe it was

08:12.560 --> 08:17.200
Like just so full of love as you didn't put any love in this one. Why didn't you put it?

08:17.200 --> 08:23.440
Yeah, that runs a pretty serious risk Travis of making it sound like you are ready for this engagement to be terminated

08:23.440 --> 08:28.400
Just like hmm. Oh, this is very this very important passes VIP

08:29.840 --> 08:36.840
Something's missing something is missing Patrice. Oh, maybe that's it. It's very important pasta. I just feel like we should save it

08:37.360 --> 08:44.480
For special occasions. This is like a special that's a special pasta. We can't just have this pasta every day. This is our

08:44.480 --> 08:49.120
Engagement pasta. I yeah, there's ritual their sack their ceremony. There's

08:50.280 --> 08:57.280
Sacrifice their sacrifice gonna say sacrifice, but that's not what I meant. They're a sacrifice that butternut was doing just fine

08:57.280 --> 09:00.000
Yeah, thank you. I think it's cool

09:01.360 --> 09:04.840
To do beach pasta and nobody talks about this

09:06.000 --> 09:11.080
But when you go on the beach, everybody's like I brought goldfish crackers. I brought

09:11.080 --> 09:17.720
ham I brought no pasta I didn't bring pot but every time I'm on the beach and I'm eating

09:18.520 --> 09:20.520
Fritos and I'm eating

09:22.120 --> 09:24.520
Uncrustables, I'm sitting there thinking like

09:25.440 --> 09:29.360
Some gnocchi would go down pretty smooth right now, but nobody's brave enough

09:29.360 --> 09:34.120
I wish I had a nice hot pasta a nice because here's the thing

09:34.120 --> 09:37.000
I'm sure that some people right there like already jumping to mastodon

09:37.000 --> 09:44.280
To mastodon us. Yeah, I haven't figured it out to say like in their little weird holes

09:45.480 --> 09:52.340
To say like what about pasta salad? It's like no no, no, we're talking about a nice steaming bowl of hot butternut squash

09:52.340 --> 09:54.340
hot butternut squash pasta

09:54.440 --> 09:56.440
I've been married for

09:57.280 --> 10:00.060
17 years now ish

10:01.320 --> 10:05.160
What's your what's your secret? That's so long. I'm about to reveal it actually

10:05.160 --> 10:09.600
Be old. That's okay. It's number two is uh, I

10:10.240 --> 10:14.800
Can say with confidence you do not need to address this because my friend is gonna come out

10:15.080 --> 10:19.160
You're gonna take a they're gonna they're gonna ask you how much you love it

10:19.280 --> 10:23.140
There's gonna be a half a moment a nanosecond of hesitation

10:23.140 --> 10:28.040
Yeah, just a single moment and the person who knows you better than anything in the world is gonna say you you don't

10:28.360 --> 10:31.880
You don't like it. You don't like the dish and then you can address it

10:31.880 --> 10:34.880
You don't have to intentionally take it on. The other thing I tell you is the

10:36.400 --> 10:42.000
Idea that we get to choose our food is a relatively new concept in the process of humans

10:42.000 --> 10:45.400
All right, here we go again, and you should probably just

10:46.600 --> 10:50.400
Yeah, you should probably just eat it a little salt little pepper. I

10:51.240 --> 10:57.880
Little tahini from this guy on your butternut squash tahini on your little

10:57.880 --> 11:03.840
I don't go wild maybe a little like a ginger based hot sauce in there

11:03.840 --> 11:04.320
Yeah

11:04.320 --> 11:06.040
Maybe crumble up some fucking

11:06.040 --> 11:12.920
Takis and like throw that in there and then maybe put in some fucking maple syrup like you're the elf from elf is what I'm saying

11:13.120 --> 11:15.120
This will like address

11:15.560 --> 11:20.480
The issue if your partner sees you go to get the ingredients that aren't in this one

11:20.480 --> 11:22.320
Yeah, like it's like hey

11:22.320 --> 11:28.720
Can we have some table side cumin so like salt and pepper and some table side cumin with fresh parsley that's like chopped up

11:28.840 --> 11:33.840
Like can we have some of that just like table side and maybe like pizza on the side the original

11:34.480 --> 11:36.480
The original recipe is on

11:37.640 --> 11:41.560
Uncompromised it is it the love recipe is still there

11:41.840 --> 11:47.280
But the the tahini represents our growth since the engagement it

11:47.280 --> 11:54.600
Represents the curveballs that life throws at us sometimes sometimes also it represents that recliner

11:54.600 --> 12:00.960
We bought together. You know what? I mean? Like you make it just make it you make the butter you make it you make it

12:00.960 --> 12:06.280
You make hot shot. Hey hot shit. You think you're the best at making butternut squash. Why don't you fuck?

12:06.280 --> 12:10.320
Let's see what you've got and send it to the three of us. We'll eat it live on air

12:10.320 --> 12:15.920
Oh, yeah, it was an A&B Pepsi verse coke taste challenge. We'll do a blind taste as a both of them

12:15.920 --> 12:22.420
We'll tell you which one loves the other one more if you make it and your partner is not like this is outrageous

12:22.880 --> 12:27.880
Yeah, this is so much better than what I normally do then they then listen

12:29.120 --> 12:33.800
They like there's more. Yeah. Oh, maybe you make your own

12:34.600 --> 12:40.240
personal pan butternut squash beach pasta and then you put it before a panel of judges including

12:40.240 --> 12:45.820
I net garden. Yeah, Bobby Flay. Yes, and for no reason Millie Bobby Brown

12:45.820 --> 12:51.600
I believe Bobby Brown and Bobby Bobby Flay is our new show on the Food Network. We ran out of ideas

12:53.200 --> 12:58.120
It's Millie Vanilla Bobby Flay, come on, let's go we have no ideas left

13:01.320 --> 13:08.520
The wizard would like to share it it you're done talking about butternut squash pasta. I have a hard time believing that I'm

13:08.520 --> 13:13.240
Hungry, I am hung. It's making me really hungry. Actually, I would like to move

13:13.240 --> 13:17.360
I don't even like butternut squash pasta, but it's one of those things where when you talk about it enough

13:17.360 --> 13:24.400
It's like do I like squash is deceptive like that, especially butternut squash. Yeah, you hear that you say that enough times

13:24.400 --> 13:29.120
You're like sweet creamy treat and you try to eat it. No, the only squash that lives up to it is

13:29.960 --> 13:36.120
Delicata everything else is a pretend everything else sucks shit. This is how to pick. I mean everything how to become a fool

13:36.120 --> 13:37.720
I

13:37.720 --> 13:43.960
Become a fool. This one's got a lot of good wisdom in it is also posted in fun activities pranks practical jokes

13:44.480 --> 13:50.600
So it's like that's a that's a big scope wiki. How fun activities is

13:51.400 --> 13:52.560
most

13:52.560 --> 13:57.600
Fit like umbrella umbrella, but that could be like taking a nap or bowling

13:58.320 --> 14:05.440
Damn, I'm looking at the have fun activities list now and there's some there's some stuff in here

14:05.440 --> 14:12.600
I've never even thought about before like how to have computer fun content games writing and more or how to pop a balloon

14:13.320 --> 14:19.080
Huh? There's how to tie up a balloon and then how to pop a balloon and then how to perform grindcore vocals

14:19.880 --> 14:24.520
Okay, how to release a balloon back into the wild. Yeah, damn

14:24.520 --> 14:29.960
I almost kind of want to read some of these how to entertain yourself without objects. Holy shit

14:29.960 --> 14:33.440
Oh in like a in a completely empty void

14:33.440 --> 14:36.400
Yeah to entertain yourself. There is no

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
There's no I'm in a

14:39.120 --> 14:45.240
Room free of mass and space. It's just time and thought in here

14:45.240 --> 14:52.200
I have it. I'm in my mind prison and I'm going to entertain myself now how to become a fool make assumptions

14:52.280 --> 14:56.780
It said that assuming makes an ass out of you and me. Well, nothing has changed it does

14:56.780 --> 15:04.740
Can I cool I've I've always wondered about that saying by the way because I get the like I made an assumption and that

15:04.860 --> 15:06.500
Made an ass out of me

15:06.500 --> 15:09.820
But how does you making an assumption make an ass out of me too?

15:09.820 --> 15:13.220
Yeah, like Griffin makes an assumption that makes an ass out of me in

15:14.060 --> 15:18.020
And all that it'd be cool if in Sherlock season 5

15:18.660 --> 15:20.860
Benedict Cumberbunch was like, ah

15:21.700 --> 15:25.460
Your cell phone has a scratch on it, which means what am I doing?

15:25.460 --> 15:27.460
Fuck me, right, you know

15:28.460 --> 15:34.540
But the constable walks with a limp so he couldn't have at what nips. Yeah, I don't know you're sure though

15:34.540 --> 15:37.260
I don't know for you. We know none of us know for sure. So like

15:37.820 --> 15:42.580
You know, you make a deduction you make a dead out of you and sure

15:43.180 --> 15:45.620
I I try to get for a while

15:45.620 --> 15:51.460
I tried to get assuming makes an ass out of you because like assume makes an ass out of you and me

15:51.460 --> 15:54.940
It doesn't make sense, right? It's just like that's the spelling gag, right?

15:54.940 --> 16:01.260
But it when you say assuming it means not like assuming there's nothing. Yeah, so I try to get for a while going

16:01.940 --> 16:08.620
Assuming makes an ass out of you and being size celebrity chef and restaurant. Oh, yeah. Okay, but no

16:09.660 --> 16:14.880
Really got into it very much, but I did have a good ten years where I tried to get

16:15.980 --> 16:20.460
That's a long time on it doesn't pop up so often and you know what actually I

16:20.460 --> 16:27.180
I will say now 12 years because we're here. I'm doing it now. Yeah trying to get it going again

16:27.180 --> 16:32.020
Well, don't read your insurance schedule and policy wording is another good way to be a fool

16:32.300 --> 16:33.220
Huh?

16:33.220 --> 16:36.140
If you had an insurance claim declined by your insurance company

16:36.140 --> 16:40.100
You will know that this is one of the more detrimental acts of foolishness one can commit

16:40.620 --> 16:45.620
Now usually there's some I would say a little better pacing in wiki

16:45.620 --> 16:48.980
How articles of like we're gonna start very broad and raw

16:48.980 --> 16:50.260
general

16:50.260 --> 16:52.100
but to go from

16:52.100 --> 16:54.100
make assumptions

16:54.140 --> 16:59.780
Don't read your insurance policy. It's like wait, hold on. There's no steps between those two

16:59.820 --> 17:07.060
But why I will say I if you don't read your insurance policy you are making the assumption that it's all fine

17:07.060 --> 17:09.220
Yeah, that's true. That's an assumption. That's

17:10.260 --> 17:16.060
People are good. Yeah, I assume that these little words are fine, but that's like also

17:16.060 --> 17:18.060
insurance

17:18.860 --> 17:20.860
like if I wanted

17:21.140 --> 17:28.140
to worry about every little thing and have like my fucking head on a swivel 24-7 despite the

17:28.620 --> 17:30.620
my own sort of

17:30.700 --> 17:31.780
mental

17:31.780 --> 17:36.100
It's a caduceus that I've got going on my little what's it's that I've got going up up there

17:36.100 --> 17:39.300
I wouldn't have the insurance. I would be always ready for it

17:39.300 --> 17:43.660
I have insurance so I don't have to sweat this small stuff, baby. You know what I mean?

17:43.660 --> 17:45.780
Yes, yeah, I guess that's true

17:46.860 --> 17:49.740
Don't have a legal eye glance over your contracts

17:50.740 --> 17:55.780
Those believing they can do this alone are somewhat foolish. You must have a sound knowledge of law

17:55.780 --> 18:01.940
I can't I'd say those assuming that they don't need that and we're already covered here

18:01.940 --> 18:06.580
Yeah, I was gonna say just this a great point cuz I was gonna say you could just say don't read contracts before you sign them

18:06.700 --> 18:10.740
But that does fall under the bigger umbrella of making assumptions

18:10.740 --> 18:15.060
Don't make assumption and also I will say that assumptions are

18:15.900 --> 18:20.860
Fundamental to our survival as a species. Yeah, right. So what do you want from me?

18:20.940 --> 18:27.340
Don't be a fucking dum-dum because here's step four. Go ahead breach a contract now. Oh

18:28.060 --> 18:33.740
Challenge now are you this writer? Okay, the writer this wiki how article has not been paid in three months

18:33.740 --> 18:40.960
I think that's right tell June that maybe sometimes you do think about looking at other people

18:41.500 --> 18:45.420
That's one thing you could do. Hey, here's one thing you could do get a job at wiki

18:45.420 --> 18:50.340
How and then just assume that the insurance they give you is in a cover elective procedures

18:50.380 --> 18:55.780
They don't and you're like, well then I quit and they're like, well you need to give us six weeks notice and I'm like fuck

18:55.780 --> 18:57.780
I didn't read that contract

18:57.780 --> 19:04.180
Shit view this article as a do as I say not as I do and that this person writing this has

19:05.020 --> 19:10.540
had a personal crisis or crises or it's like the joke of like

19:10.980 --> 19:15.020
Opening up a fortune cookie and saying like you found a fortune that says like help

19:15.020 --> 19:17.020
I'm trapped in a cookie factory, right?

19:17.020 --> 19:23.140
This is someone trapped at wiki how by an ironclad contract with bad insurance trying to call for yes

19:23.140 --> 19:29.100
Okay, so what ever written a memoir called? Here's how I fucked up. I think that

19:30.340 --> 19:35.420
This is a living document. It's a living document that we find ourselves in

19:37.140 --> 19:39.140
Now like it's a

19:39.940 --> 19:42.420
Spotify would pay 20 million. Yeah

19:43.540 --> 19:45.540
the story of Spotify

19:45.700 --> 19:51.080
Just like follow the story of this sad person. Do we have author info here?

19:51.080 --> 19:55.040
No, literally nothing. Okay, we'll call him jar

19:55.400 --> 19:57.040
Josh

19:57.040 --> 20:03.300
So just to go through it again Josh made an assumption and he didn't read his insurance schedule policy wording

20:03.300 --> 20:08.120
And he didn't have a legal eye glance over his contract and then he did go ahead and breach the contract

20:08.280 --> 20:16.000
Do you guys know what an insurance schedule? Yeah, definitely the net the next step in charge is when you do insurance on time

20:16.000 --> 20:18.080
He'll tell me later. I assume if I need to know

20:18.080 --> 20:21.880
In the next step in his journey over extend yourself financially

20:22.240 --> 20:28.220
Governments that have passed national credit acts and have imposed strict law surrounding borrowing and lending of money are to be commended

20:30.880 --> 20:34.360
Governments I know we all we all give you a hard time

20:34.360 --> 20:39.080
We all like to think that you know, Sunday morning quarterback and all that but you know

20:39.560 --> 20:43.960
The ones that have passed national credit acts and imposed strict law surrounding borrowing and lending of money

20:43.960 --> 20:45.960
They I give them a big round of applause

20:45.960 --> 20:51.640
Does it ever broaden back out to like, you know make promises?

20:51.640 --> 20:56.680
You can't keep or is it continue on this like business strategies only?

20:56.680 --> 21:02.800
Well, let's I mean it starts to unravel here a little bit stands surety for someone else's debt

21:02.800 --> 21:09.060
I don't know what that means. But if that word sounds strange, it's because the next sentence is the Bible teaches us that this is foolishness

21:09.920 --> 21:13.340
Standing surety for someone else's debt. It is often an emotional decision

21:13.340 --> 21:20.240
It's fun when the Bible gets in there and it's like bye. Whoa, bye. Is this it? Has it been Bible stuff the whole time?

21:20.240 --> 21:24.600
I didn't know the Bible had stuff about insurance in it or contracts

21:25.280 --> 21:32.620
Do you think that the the the author like turn it in and wiki house like you can't call it the libertarian agenda

21:32.620 --> 21:36.540
That's not how that's not the structure that we use. Yeah, he's like well

21:37.080 --> 21:38.000
What about this?

21:38.000 --> 21:43.560
Yeah, I would I would also say if you're gonna cite the Bible in an article of like how to be a fool one

21:44.080 --> 21:48.820
there's plenty of stuff in the Bible about fools and stuff and like a fool and like but also

21:49.760 --> 21:54.880
Plenty of people have read the Bible have been a fool my dude. That also doesn't work Travis

21:54.880 --> 21:56.400
It doesn't say read the Bible

21:56.400 --> 22:03.240
It says don't purchase real estate timeshares or property fractions without physically viewing the property a saying exists in God

22:03.240 --> 22:09.400
We trust everything else. We audit the same should be for property or real estate prior to purchasing it. That's good. I mean

22:10.120 --> 22:12.640
That's good advice. Hey, we can make jokes about it

22:12.640 --> 22:17.080
But like go to the house before you buy it with all the money. Are there people who aren't doing that?

22:18.440 --> 22:24.120
I mean are there people in the world who are like, what's that a timeshare you say sight unseen?

22:24.120 --> 22:26.640
I'll take it. You seem like a trust or the man

22:26.640 --> 22:32.280
I did have to put an offer on the house that we live in now in DC without going to it first

22:32.280 --> 22:39.580
But what if you've gone there Griffin and it was 1 8th scale. There was a little baby house guys just for like a

22:40.400 --> 22:45.800
Shits and giggles I did a quick Google search of the Bible. Yeah to see mentions a fool a man

22:47.000 --> 22:49.160
We give the Bible a hard time sometimes

22:50.840 --> 22:55.380
There's a lot of stuff that has been used bad, but man, there's some good stuff

22:55.380 --> 22:59.220
Well, give me some Bible juice. This is Proverbs 18 to okay

22:59.220 --> 23:01.220
Oh

23:04.820 --> 23:09.300
Marker where he should start the no context. Yeah, sure talk here right here

23:09.580 --> 23:15.020
So I just want to take it to the word for a second problems 18 to says a fool takes no pleasure in understanding

23:15.780 --> 23:18.560
But only in expressing his opinion. Oh

23:19.420 --> 23:21.420
Damn Jesus from downtown

23:22.300 --> 23:24.860
Jesus that's a slam-dunk man good a

23:24.860 --> 23:31.080
Fool's lips walk into a fight and his mouth takes a beating walk into a

23:32.460 --> 23:34.460
Fight in his mouth takes a beating

23:34.700 --> 23:40.380
Well, yeah, okay that one doesn't actually do it for me as good Bible the Bible. Okay, well

23:41.060 --> 23:45.260
In the lips. Yeah never trust in his own mind is a fool

23:45.460 --> 23:50.300
This is how Joe Rogan starts every episode whoever trusts in his own mind is a fool

23:50.300 --> 23:54.640
But he who walks in wisdom will be delivered. That's Proverbs 28 26

23:55.260 --> 24:00.420
That's not a one-to-one though. Is it no trust in his own mind, but he who is wise

24:01.500 --> 24:04.780
Now there's also kind of a comedy rule of threes thing

24:04.780 --> 24:10.500
But for the Bible where if you read three Bible verses on your podcast your podcast is a Bible podcast

24:10.940 --> 24:12.460
Yeah

24:12.460 --> 24:15.180
By by bringing in Proverbs 26

24:15.180 --> 24:21.860
3 through 12 just listen to this 3 through 12 is a lot juice 3 through 12 is a lot of Bible my

24:22.340 --> 24:27.500
Each one is one word over. We never read the Bible. I know Justin

24:28.020 --> 24:31.780
We never read the law. He saved it up. We got a big load built up

24:33.700 --> 24:34.660
A

24:34.660 --> 24:41.260
Whip for the horse a bridle for the donkey and a rod for the back of fools. Well, hold on

24:41.260 --> 24:45.060
Oh, yeah, it's good. No, that's not correct

24:45.060 --> 24:46.060
That part's not good

24:46.060 --> 24:52.140
But listen to the next part answer not a fool according to his folly lest you be like him yourself

24:52.580 --> 24:59.980
Answer a fool according to his folly lest he be wise in his own eyes whoever sends a message by the hand of a fool

25:00.660 --> 25:04.380
Cuts off his own feet and drinks violence. Okay

25:04.380 --> 25:10.660
No, you said you have book ended like in the center there of like hey when someone's being dumb don't answer him dumb

25:10.660 --> 25:17.140
Or just makes you seem dumb, too. Great. But in the first part there it was like yeah with that horse bridle that donkey

25:17.460 --> 25:21.620
Beat up that idiot. And then the next part was if I remember correctly

25:22.300 --> 25:24.300
He who sends a message

25:25.140 --> 25:31.040
By the hand of a fool cuts off his own feet and drinks fire. Yeah, I love sometimes when the

25:31.040 --> 25:38.120
Yeah, I love sometimes when the Bible is like do not have to borrow from thy neighbor and not if

25:38.520 --> 25:41.160
Repay it thine pride shall

25:41.600 --> 25:48.480
Cast ye off into hellfire and cut off your dick and your balls and feed it to goats and it's like holy shit

25:48.480 --> 25:53.560
I'm like calm dude dust. Thou not readeth thine insurance policy

25:53.560 --> 25:56.880
Then cut off your head. It's pretty modern. Oh, I mean well

25:56.880 --> 26:04.440
Okay. Yeah, I do like that part where it's like it's easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than it

26:04.440 --> 26:08.840
Is for a lame-o to do a sick ollie. Yeah, it's like wait, hold on

26:08.840 --> 26:15.360
Well, it's like oh that's fucking feet and his hands at arms put him in a pot and make his mom eat it

26:15.760 --> 26:17.760
Don't borrow

26:17.800 --> 26:24.000
The fool folds his hands and eats his own flesh. What that's Ecclesiastes guys

26:24.000 --> 26:31.080
Well, I'm fully out of Proverbs. Yeah, the fool whole folds his hands and eats his own flesh. I've never

26:32.480 --> 26:37.660
That is a good point if I saw somebody just knowing on themselves over bike don't be a fool don't come on

26:37.880 --> 26:45.180
Have you uh food heard of it? Hey, what does the Bible say about don't use the internet without the correct security slash antivirus settings?

26:46.440 --> 26:52.980
Want your money stolen out of your bank account your hard drive infected with scary viruses your hard drive crashing on you at that crucial

26:52.980 --> 26:56.880
Moment right when you're about to finish if not, don't do this

26:58.960 --> 27:00.960
Don't try to fix a man slash woman

27:01.440 --> 27:07.100
Huh? I don't know. I don't know if that's a good one wiki how now once again though

27:08.360 --> 27:10.360
To go from insurance

27:10.600 --> 27:12.600
read a contract

27:12.700 --> 27:20.440
You know don't take on someone else's day. Don't try to fix someone. It's like what hold on big props though wiki how

27:20.440 --> 27:26.080
wiki Bible for this next Bible how for this next one don't engage in an extramarital affair

27:26.320 --> 27:30.960
This one doesn't apply to open marriages if it's within the terms of your mutual understanding

27:31.880 --> 27:36.720
alright, there's a version of this that doesn't include that post script and I I

27:37.680 --> 27:39.680
Appreciate it. Yeah

27:40.640 --> 27:42.640
Probably forced in by the editor

27:42.640 --> 27:50.080
Editing pass here or there. I do like the idea of wiki how editors, but they only care about very specific things

27:50.200 --> 27:53.020
It's like you mentioned the Bible in here. That's fine or whatever

27:53.020 --> 27:55.020
But over here you talk about extramarital affairs

27:55.120 --> 27:59.720
Does that apply to people with open marriages where that is within the bounds of the agreement between them?

27:59.960 --> 28:06.600
Why just include that for safety for safety and also I mean we get into some more virtuous stuff here

28:06.600 --> 28:09.920
Don't slander don't make promises. You can't keep then it gets into

28:09.920 --> 28:16.200
Don't read contra indications on medicines and ingredients on natural health products and foodstuffs

28:16.880 --> 28:21.120
What what is this post Griffin? Well, it's how to not

28:21.960 --> 28:27.440
Spiraling this don't be a fool. This guy's had a hard time of it Justin. He has made assumptions

28:27.440 --> 28:30.640
He has fucked his insurance up. He did a bad contract

28:32.080 --> 28:34.080
Behind his wife's back

28:35.880 --> 28:38.200
She said we did not pills that hate each other

28:38.200 --> 28:43.880
yeah, then he did buy a property that did not have walls or a

28:44.480 --> 28:49.200
Floor in it or roof and then he was got on the internet to find out what legal comp

28:49.480 --> 28:52.000
Like what how paid he could get for that?

28:52.120 --> 28:58.920
but then he got viruses and he tried to fix someone and then he took two pills that made him sick and

28:59.160 --> 29:03.440
Then he believed that STDs only happen to other people is the last step in here

29:03.440 --> 29:05.440
Oh

29:10.040 --> 29:16.160
Is it Griffin is there like a secret last line on this wiki how it's like by reading this article

29:16.160 --> 29:20.840
You're already a fool. Like yeah, like or a stonemason

29:21.840 --> 29:23.600
You've made it this far

29:23.600 --> 29:28.480
Step on in to your you haven't clicked away. You have the rigor we're looking for. Yeah

29:28.480 --> 29:33.760
Yeah, this is a there's some stuff in here. I'm worried actually that this

29:34.720 --> 29:38.000
Segment will have a net negative effect

29:38.640 --> 29:45.560
Because there's some stuff in here. That's like you should make sure that your medicines don't counteract each other. That's good stuff

29:45.560 --> 29:48.960
Yeah, you don't want yeah, you don't want to pop some you know

29:50.560 --> 29:55.080
Well reason in the afternoon and then a little bit later taking a you know

29:55.080 --> 30:00.600
cold formula that also has gualphicin in it your shits gonna be

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
Your shits gonna be whacked out

30:03.200 --> 30:08.400
But in doing that you have assumed that these two pills don't hate each other. Yeah

30:08.400 --> 30:15.520
Yeah, you've assumed that pharmacists and like scientists know what they're talking about. Okay, that's true. That's a good point

30:15.520 --> 30:20.060
Okay, so I guess the whole thing is just don't assume don't assume baby question

30:20.060 --> 30:24.740
Everything what they had in one the truth is out there. The truth is out there question everything

30:26.140 --> 30:28.580
We are taking a beating this segment from

30:29.900 --> 30:32.820
We are eating our own flesh right now. Yeah

30:32.820 --> 30:38.460
We're holding our hands and eating your own flesh to drink violence drinking violence left and right

30:38.460 --> 30:45.780
I woke up this morning. I say it's delicious. All right, that's what they don't tell you violence. Mmm. It tastes like butternut squash

30:45.780 --> 30:51.220
Um, so I went to Dave Matthews concert last night and I yes

30:51.220 --> 30:57.020
I brought back a very special thing. Can I show you guys? Yeah. Okay. Hold on. Give me a second

30:57.860 --> 30:59.860
Why is he doing a visual?

31:00.020 --> 31:03.580
It's for kids. This one's for kids kids. Love Dave Matthews band

31:04.220 --> 31:08.220
My kids love Dave Matthews band cuz I told him about we dumped poopy on a bunch of people

31:09.020 --> 31:11.020
Me Dave Matthews

31:11.660 --> 31:13.660
Holy shit, it's

31:13.660 --> 31:15.660
The one and only Dave

31:16.700 --> 31:22.100
Ask why you had to stand up from your desk to go get a pair of sunglasses

31:23.580 --> 31:30.140
That was that was my good friend Travis and I just why didn't he have the glasses ready to go at the table?

31:30.140 --> 31:34.380
I'm wearing the glass. I had to switch places with Travis Dave

31:34.380 --> 31:39.100
I heard you did a killer show last night in Dayton. I did I barely remember it

31:39.100 --> 31:46.100
Uh, but it was three hours long. I heard with no opener. Oh, yeah, baby. How do you not remember that?

31:46.660 --> 31:53.580
Well, all the shows start to run together after a while, especially when you have done so many drugs

31:54.300 --> 31:56.300
Hey, can you talk normal Dave?

31:58.420 --> 32:00.420
No, Dave

32:00.580 --> 32:07.060
No, what brings us what brings you to our show Dave? Wow, what an honor? Thank you so much for asking

32:07.060 --> 32:11.800
Did you know about the Bible and you were like gotta get all I love it

32:12.380 --> 32:16.700
Your camera is blurring in self-defense. Go ahead. Well, I have that effect on

32:17.820 --> 32:19.820
audio-visual equipment I

32:20.740 --> 32:24.420
So as you know, I have conquered the musical scene

32:25.140 --> 32:30.300
I've won several Grammys. You sound a lot like a good tone, which I hate

32:30.300 --> 32:36.740
I get that a lot. Can you try to sound less like Oogie Boogie from Nightmare Before Christmas? I can try

32:37.060 --> 32:41.380
Was that that was more Oogie Boogie, wasn't it? Yeah, it's going deeper down the bowl

32:41.380 --> 32:45.900
I'm looking to expand the Dave Matthews brand and

32:46.620 --> 32:52.420
So I have done a little market research. Sorry the date what the what Dave Matthews brand

32:52.420 --> 32:58.380
So I've done some market research to look up where other musicians have partnered with brands

32:59.300 --> 33:04.260
So that I can see what's out there because I'm looking for something that screams Dave Matthews

33:04.620 --> 33:07.500
You know when I do it and so I'm gonna read you guys

33:07.500 --> 33:13.820
You really don't sound that much like yourself right now David. I sang a lot last night, buddy

33:13.820 --> 33:15.820
Were you listening to me?

33:15.820 --> 33:23.820
By having a hoarse throat would cause one to sort of do the sort of affectations that you're putting on for us, David

33:24.580 --> 33:26.900
I'm just trying to put on a good show here man

33:26.900 --> 33:33.780
It's the goal to have fun. And if you will allow me we might just make it play your little game, David

33:34.020 --> 33:36.020
Okay, I'm gonna describe it

33:36.060 --> 33:40.540
This guy is a family man now with a wife and two little babies

33:40.540 --> 33:45.860
So this grammy-nominated producer took his perfectionist attitude to a new endeavor

33:46.380 --> 33:48.380
baby strollers

33:48.580 --> 33:54.420
Together with Cybex. He launched a collection of strollers and other parent gear

33:54.940 --> 33:56.940
Featuring his own designs and logo

33:57.620 --> 34:02.900
Throughout the strollers of bold jungle inspired patterns complete with lions and zebras

34:03.500 --> 34:05.500
and flora

34:05.500 --> 34:11.060
And on the outside of each is the we the best logo now, it's obvious who this

34:11.580 --> 34:14.140
Who this musician slash producer is?

34:15.020 --> 34:17.020
But you guys tell me

34:19.340 --> 34:21.340
Rick Rubin

34:21.340 --> 34:22.340
Incorrect

34:22.340 --> 34:27.260
We okay. I didn't okay. So just to sort of tell you where I'm at

34:27.260 --> 34:31.780
And I'm trying really hard this episode and for the rest of my life not to make assumptions. I didn't make any assumptions

34:31.780 --> 34:36.020
And I'm trying really hard this episode and for the rest of my life not to make assumptions. I didn't know that

34:36.020 --> 34:38.020
This was going to be a game Dave

34:38.100 --> 34:40.100
No, this is market research

34:40.940 --> 34:45.740
Yeah, no for sure, but it feels like a game that doesn't it like it feels like I don't play games

34:45.740 --> 34:49.220
That'll be is it DJ Khaled?

34:49.780 --> 34:54.500
It is a Khaled. Is it DJ Khaled? It is DJ Khaled

34:55.060 --> 34:57.060
Okay, that's correct. I feel nothing

34:57.060 --> 35:01.460
Now I got that I want you to know I got that right and I don't feel anything

35:04.060 --> 35:09.300
There was very little to be fair that there's very little reaction from day there was no reaction

35:09.300 --> 35:14.900
There was also the biggest I react so that was just all middle that bit

35:15.500 --> 35:17.340
No, it's not done yet

35:17.340 --> 35:24.340
Okay, cuz now I'm gonna tell you about my own idea and I'm gonna see what you guys think. I'm gonna make a movie

35:24.340 --> 35:28.180
Yeah, I'm gonna write and direct it and produce it who it's about

35:28.700 --> 35:36.620
What are you doing, dude? I just told you I'm gonna make a movie. Yeah, but it's but you you're fucking like

35:37.500 --> 35:44.220
Transmogrifying in it's like you're you exist in a quantum state right now and you'll be telling me about DJ Khaled strollers

35:44.220 --> 35:46.220
I'm gonna be like

35:46.220 --> 35:51.580
I'm a multifaceted human being a little baby

35:52.060 --> 35:57.220
It's like the less confident you become in yourself. The more you move away from your I don't know

35:57.220 --> 36:03.000
Why be less confident himself his little brother's negative or his friend. I'm not related. Sorry juice

36:03.000 --> 36:10.180
You're now you're the one who's making assumptions. I'm not related to Dave Matthews. Let David do his segment, please

36:10.180 --> 36:12.180
Can I please tell you about my movie?

36:12.180 --> 36:17.700
Yeah, so are you talking about I now pronounce you Chuck and Larry too. I know you were in the first one

36:17.700 --> 36:20.380
So funny, I already had a good message over screen

36:20.380 --> 36:24.680
And now it is it you don't mess with the Zohan to because I know you were in that one

36:24.860 --> 36:26.140
No, okay

36:26.140 --> 36:28.140
what it is about a voyeur and

36:28.300 --> 36:30.300
He falls out of a tree gets hit by a car

36:30.860 --> 36:36.620
And he falls in love with the young woman of the father who hit him with a car and I know what you're thinking

36:36.620 --> 36:38.900
That seems pretty straightforward. Well, here's the twist

36:38.900 --> 36:42.900
yeah, their son from the future shows up and

36:43.660 --> 36:48.020
He gets into some vehicle related shenanigans as well. I call the movie crash

36:50.260 --> 36:52.260
Okay

37:00.580 --> 37:03.820
Dave first of all, I want to say first of all, I want to apologize

37:03.820 --> 37:09.980
Okay, I want to apologize because you know what I did I assumed that what you were gonna say wasn't gonna be very funny

37:09.980 --> 37:12.100
And it was very funny Dave. It was very good

37:13.180 --> 37:16.260
It's a drama. I this is a drama movie

37:16.340 --> 37:20.660
Don't listen you already got the point and you barely got through there

37:21.260 --> 37:26.140
You dropped that uh, you got right through that hairpin turn. You should look back just move forward

37:26.460 --> 37:31.980
They have made a couple of films called crash and one won an Oscar

37:31.980 --> 37:38.500
What was it one out one of them won a weird David Cronenberg sex Oscar?

37:38.500 --> 37:41.580
Which is a special award that won the Oscar. What was it about?

37:43.860 --> 37:48.940
Who gets hit by a car I get the films confused sometimes because they are both named crash

37:48.940 --> 37:50.940
But I think the one that won the Oscar

37:51.140 --> 37:53.260
was the one that fixed

37:53.660 --> 37:59.960
Racism and the one that won the David Cronenberg sex Oscar the award that they made to give David Cronenberg for his films

37:59.960 --> 38:03.620
Was that David Cronenberg sex car crash movie called crash?

38:05.360 --> 38:06.320
But that's fine

38:06.320 --> 38:10.000
I think that that proves the point that there can be multiple movies called crash

38:10.480 --> 38:14.280
People like movies called crash people love movies called crash

38:14.800 --> 38:17.800
Yeah, does your movie have James Spader in it?

38:18.360 --> 38:22.760
And he has sex with a car in an accident. It has Crispin Glover in it

38:24.100 --> 38:26.100
Well now hold on

38:26.100 --> 38:33.540
What's wrong now, why did you put Crispin Glover in there Dave well cuz it's I he's gonna play opposite

38:33.540 --> 38:38.160
Leah Thompson and they have great chemistry. Yeah, they were great and back to the future together

38:39.320 --> 38:41.180
What's that movie? I?

38:41.180 --> 38:44.840
Don't worry about it because nowhere in your synopsis. Did you mention time travel?

38:44.840 --> 38:49.540
So I think that your films in your films in the know the Sun comes back from the future

38:49.540 --> 38:57.140
You so you heard it just then right? You heard it just fine. No, it's a it's a different you said two and mines from

38:58.260 --> 39:00.260
Okay. All right

39:00.620 --> 39:07.060
Dave gotta go do some rewrites. Yeah, Dave. You should have gotten out of there man. You got greedy, didn't you?

39:07.060 --> 39:12.500
You got greedy got stuck with your hand in the comedy tiller, didn't you but you know what? I'm gonna go

39:12.900 --> 39:14.900
Yeah

39:14.900 --> 39:20.020
But I'll be back with more ideas fucking way to who asked Dave Matthews fair guys, but

39:22.020 --> 39:24.560
Gotta go but not because of that cuz I'm

39:25.460 --> 39:27.460
my own

39:28.220 --> 39:30.220
My choice not yours

39:30.220 --> 39:34.320
Baby that's good. That's funny

39:41.620 --> 39:44.460
It was me the whole time where the fuck have you been?

39:47.020 --> 39:52.300
That's sorry, that's how I start every ad now. Yeah. Yeah, it's a very aggressive but it works

39:52.300 --> 39:53.980
Have you been on the internet?

39:53.980 --> 39:58.960
Because if you have been on the internet, you've seen a lot of great websites and you start looking at me think I could never

39:58.960 --> 40:04.380
I never could make a great website like this. Well, I got news for you my friend. You definitely could

40:05.020 --> 40:11.780
Squarespace makes it easy enough for anybody to make a website and update a website traps is used multiple times, correct?

40:12.020 --> 40:16.660
And if we can do it, I did it one friend anybody can I did Griffin did it to get it once

40:17.020 --> 40:19.900
Let me just throw this out there now might be a great time to start working

40:19.900 --> 40:25.100
You know how you had that great idea for a social media website. This might be a great time to start on that

40:25.100 --> 40:28.900
I don't know if Squarespace could build a social media network for you

40:29.460 --> 40:33.820
But they could probably make a blank Google document and that's about that's a social network

40:33.820 --> 40:39.540
It would work better at this way than some other things if they would just be chill. They got

40:40.260 --> 40:42.580
Really cool templates. They're kind of like building blocks

40:42.580 --> 40:47.300
You can move around to put the piece exactly where you want it. You don't have to code stuff

40:47.300 --> 40:51.760
You just have to make something that you like and they have these templates that make it easy

40:51.760 --> 40:55.880
To do that have already been created for you by people who really know what they're doing

40:56.720 --> 41:02.280
And I think you could benefit from it. I think it's worth a shot. It's fun to make websites with Squarespace

41:02.280 --> 41:07.040
That's what I'll say. Yeah. Yeah, you know what? You know what? I'll say if you're like, I don't know about bill

41:07.040 --> 41:10.680
I believe in you. Yeah, and you don't even have to there's no risk

41:10.680 --> 41:14.960

Good deal

41:26.760 --> 41:31.480
You know what? It's getting colder getting colder. It's snowed here in Cincinnati

41:32.560 --> 41:34.560
Dusting and you know what that means?

41:34.640 --> 41:38.040
It's time to break out those sweaters, but you know what sometimes you don't know what that means

41:38.080 --> 41:41.520
So when it gets cold Justin the earth is not facing the Sun

41:41.520 --> 41:48.760
I don't okay your war is gotten between I didn't sign up for those doors big body got between us in the Sun

41:48.920 --> 41:52.280
Yeah, and cuz take away kitty told him to so

41:52.760 --> 41:58.440
It's getting colder. It's time to break up those sweaters. I just got some brand new sweaters, right because some of my sweaters

41:59.120 --> 42:02.680
They're getting a little thin little moth-eaten gotta keep them away from those moths guys

42:02.680 --> 42:07.880
I don't know why I let those moths in there. They're eating up my sweaters. I got some new sweaters though from stitch fix

42:07.880 --> 42:14.480
They're comfy. They're cozy. One of the sweaters looks like Chris Evans sweater from knives out. What's up?

42:15.400 --> 42:17.120
Yeah, baby

42:17.120 --> 42:23.400
So if you're like, I would like to have that is the chunkiest cable knit I have I

42:23.960 --> 42:27.880
Have I don't know how that thing stays together. So chunky cable knit

42:27.880 --> 42:33.160
It's mostly held together by the salt of the ocean spray as you're out catching lobsters on a cold England morning

42:33.160 --> 42:35.880
it's just his body pressing outward against the

42:35.880 --> 42:41.440
The the cable knit fabric that is just like kind of with tension holding the whole thing on him

42:41.440 --> 42:43.440
He takes it off and unspools

42:43.680 --> 42:48.380
He takes it off when he takes off the sweater just comes completely undone

42:48.680 --> 42:52.960
Well, now you've got people thinking about Chris Evans taking a sweater off girl. We lost them. They're out of here

42:52.960 --> 43:00.800
I have a sexiest man this year stitch fix asked me to do that to associate like their brand with like a like Captain America's bod

43:09.800 --> 43:14.600
You can just picture it right in your head. All you have to do is answer a few questions. That's in the copy. That's weird

43:15.600 --> 43:19.480
All you have to do is answer a few questions about where you typically get your clothes from

43:19.640 --> 43:24.460
What you like to wear your price range and where you would take Chris Evans on an expensive dinner

43:24.460 --> 43:30.980

46:17.460 --> 46:21.540
Beautiful boy. Look at this beauty. I see some fresh mozzarella

46:22.180 --> 46:27.100

Yeah, but there's really good you okay you could guess what those ingredients are for a hundred thousand eons

46:33.140 --> 46:38.260
Well, I mean, it looks like chicken and mozzarella and then maybe marinara on top

46:38.660 --> 46:44.220
Okay, and maybe between the mozzarella and the marinara is that onion is that onion ring?

48:00.180 --> 48:06.700
Satisfied I'm yeah max fun stretch goal that I will get this sentence tattooed on my body

48:06.700 --> 48:08.700
I think it's the best sentence I've ever read

48:09.140 --> 48:10.820
There's eight different things

48:10.820 --> 48:18.620
The Italian mozzarella chicken sandwich brings all the familiar flavors of a homemade Italian dinner in one delicious sandwich

48:18.620 --> 48:23.900
Do you hear that? Do you hear that Italian culture? We've summed it all up in a

48:24.780 --> 48:31.000
Sandwich this juicy lightly breaded crispy chicken breast is topped with ooey gooey fried mozzarella cheese

48:31.740 --> 48:33.740
savory marinara sauce and

48:33.860 --> 48:35.780
naturally aged rich

48:35.780 --> 48:40.780
Asiago cheese. Oh, well hell way. Yeah, so that's one that's a second panic

48:40.780 --> 48:49.740
so it's a big loaf of cheese on top of chicken and cheese and mozzarella and then it's all

48:49.900 --> 48:51.900
wrapped up with the

48:51.900 --> 48:55.980
towering toasted golden garlic not bun friends

48:55.980 --> 49:01.740
Well, I think I can speak for Italian Jesus when I say a mama mia. Yeah, this is

49:02.580 --> 49:04.580
You're going to Italian hell

49:06.060 --> 49:09.860
Folks at home who can't see won't when Justin says

49:09.860 --> 49:11.860
fried cheese

49:12.340 --> 49:18.940
We are not talking about cheese in the traditional dimensions that one is used to seeing cheese. Yeah, this is a

49:19.540 --> 49:22.860
It looks like one inch tall round. Yeah of

49:23.740 --> 49:27.900
Round loaf of cheese that has it if I may a very pale bun

49:28.860 --> 49:30.860
Well, it's a garlic knot

49:30.980 --> 49:36.100
Yeah, so it's not it's a bun. It's a garlic knot bun. It's a guy not garlic

49:36.100 --> 49:42.580
You can get it as a hamburger instead of a chicken sandwich. And then it says cheesy square goodness for all

49:45.180 --> 49:50.260
Does it say that in a in the context of a larger paragraph or is it just sort of

49:50.740 --> 49:56.420
Marginalia like it's someone has just written as a note on the press release like cheesy square goodness for all

49:56.740 --> 49:58.740
For the footnote at the bottom

49:58.780 --> 50:00.940
For those fresh never frozen beef fans

50:00.940 --> 50:08.260
The sandwich is also available as a hamburger instead of a chicken sandwich period cheesy square goodness for all wait

50:08.260 --> 50:10.980
It just says that as it's that's not even a complete thought

50:10.980 --> 50:15.100
Well, let him finish the thing cheesy square goodness to all and to all a good night

50:16.100 --> 50:19.380
This is good coated in a flavorful garlic herb sauce

50:19.380 --> 50:25.860
The garlic fries are made with Wendy's natural cut hot and crispy french fries and make the perfect pairing for those cozy winter vibes

50:25.860 --> 50:31.300
Yeah, can you smell the mouth-watering aroma of garlic yet? No

50:31.620 --> 50:36.400
No, never this PR has never asked me a question before I didn't know that I was on the clock

50:36.620 --> 50:40.520
Do we have to write it in like to be how do we answer?

50:40.520 --> 50:47.940
I think the answer is cheesy square goodness for all we have a winning track record of taking familiar favorites and combining them into his

50:48.620 --> 50:53.180
Exciting new ways to deliver a culinary experience that you won't find anywhere else

50:53.180 --> 50:59.680
Thank God the Italian mozzarella sandwiches are forged from the same delicious inspiration and innovation

50:59.900 --> 51:02.780
Giving fans an adventurous flavor experience

51:03.580 --> 51:09.820
With every bite says John Lee, you know when I go to Wendy's what am I going there for nothing?

51:09.820 --> 51:15.780
If not adventure, yeah, and also you step up to Italian Hephaestus and say forge me a sandwich

51:15.780 --> 51:20.740
They forged me in your in your your heavens for your Italian heavens forge

51:20.740 --> 51:26.300
I do want to say that every time I go to Wendy's in my car and I get the car food to eat it

51:26.300 --> 51:29.500
Well, I'm at the parking lot of like, you know

51:29.780 --> 51:34.820
My my son's Children's Theatre class because I ran out of time to eat a normal meal

51:34.820 --> 51:39.980
I do always think god dang. I wish these fries were wet like really really really

51:41.380 --> 51:43.060
Like so sloppy and wet

51:43.060 --> 51:49.100
I would love to have that in my car this wet fry energy and to make the whole car smell like garlic to

Wet and stinky too. Please. Give me that now Wendy's for me Dave. Yeah, they want to be the sloppy provider

51:55.940 --> 52:00.580
It's an adventure. Give me sloppy. Give me wet Dave

52:01.500 --> 52:03.500

52:08.140 --> 52:10.740
Give me sloppy a tattoo of my body

52:11.260 --> 52:17.300
No, wait, is that Dave Thomas saying it? Is it like give me sloppy or is it like a picture of Dave Matthews?

52:17.300 --> 52:19.300
It's a picture of Dave Thomas

52:19.300 --> 52:20.260
Dave Thomas

52:20.260 --> 52:27.380
Same with a speech bubble coming out of his head that says that says give me sloppy, but it's the actor Dave Thomas

52:28.900 --> 52:34.100
Probably the best thing that I'd like to see is those two trading jobs for a day. That'd be funny

52:34.100 --> 52:40.120
Yeah, oh like trading being a comedian and being dead being a long long dead restauranteur

52:40.120 --> 52:44.460
Being an icon not long dead. How was the Dave Matthews concert?

52:44.460 --> 52:46.460
weird quiet

52:47.980 --> 52:53.300
Wait who's switching places Dave Matthews Dave Thomas or Dave Thomas the actor. I'm so confused

52:53.300 --> 52:58.700
Are they all three switching? Are they all gonna be in a fountain together? Throw them in the bag and we'll pull out which one

52:59.940 --> 53:02.100
Mix them up. Can't tell the difference

53:03.180 --> 53:06.540
Popeye's got to give them a quick shout out. They got a new sandwich

53:07.540 --> 53:11.900
It's the black and chicken sandwich. They're starting the chicken wars a

53:11.900 --> 53:16.740
new with the black and chicken sandwich, and I just want to give a

53:18.060 --> 53:20.060
Shout out to their Twitter

53:20.540 --> 53:26.660
Because their press campaign on this is to the copycats that tried to copy our chicken sandwich back in 2019

53:32.180 --> 53:38.900

the current

53:55.020 --> 53:57.480
State of Twitter is going to have on MunchSquad

53:58.140 --> 54:03.040
Because anybody could claim to be a restaurant and just make up some wild shit

54:03.040 --> 54:08.400
And like we could report it and have to walk it back. Can you imagine? Oh my gosh?

54:08.560 --> 54:12.540
It would be such a blow to our integrity as an organization. Yeah
