00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:47.760
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother, my brother, mean advice show for the modern era.

00:47.760 --> 00:52.640
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle brother Travis McElroy.

00:52.640 --> 01:02.560
Good evening. Please be seated. I gotta say thank you to my team.

01:04.080 --> 01:11.280
And I want to say thank you to everyone who worked so hard on this campaign, this effort.

01:11.280 --> 01:18.160
It felt like me, Griffin McElroy, the youngest brother, wasn't even like one entity because

01:18.160 --> 01:23.680
our hearts had merged. But as we all know, it was looking good there in the beginning,

01:24.400 --> 01:32.960
but things started to change colors, which is confusing to me. And so I am afraid I am here

01:32.960 --> 01:42.880
tonight to concede my presidential bid. And I wanted to say out there, I love my wife and God

01:42.880 --> 01:50.640
and my son, my kid. And I just, I worked so hard, but off beans, it didn't happen this time around.

01:51.680 --> 01:55.680
Mr. McElroy, Travis McElroy of the Travis McElroy Monthly.

01:55.680 --> 01:55.920
Yeah.

01:56.960 --> 02:01.360
What party were you running with? I didn't hear a lot about your campaign.

02:01.360 --> 02:02.720
Party rock, party rock, party rock anthem.

02:03.760 --> 02:06.720
The party rock anthem party, or is it just called party rock anthem?

02:07.440 --> 02:11.840
Have you heard the song? It's not called party, it's not called party rock anthem party, is it?

02:11.840 --> 02:14.720
So your political party was the song?

02:14.720 --> 02:16.720
Next question, this is next question.

02:17.520 --> 02:20.080
Yeah, you're promised to send every American-

02:20.080 --> 02:21.600
I'm sorry, please introduce yourself.

02:21.600 --> 02:28.080
Oh, hi, this is Justin McElroy from Quibi. You said that you were going to

02:30.080 --> 02:35.200
send every American family 100,000, and I have it here in my notes. Hold on one second.

02:36.160 --> 02:41.040
I'm rubbing two Great Wolf Lodge gift cards together.

02:41.040 --> 02:45.280
Right. 100,000 smaccaroonies, you said.

02:45.280 --> 02:50.640
Sure. Yeah, I was surprised that people didn't give me more votes for that,

02:50.640 --> 02:55.840
because that's a considerable sum of money. And I listened to the words of my good,

02:56.720 --> 03:04.320
dear friend, Andrew Yang, because you know me. I'm fucking deep in the Yang gang and the cane train.

03:04.960 --> 03:09.040
So those were sort of my guiding lights. And he was like, let's give everybody a basic

03:09.040 --> 03:13.600
income. And I was like, let's give everybody 100,000 American dollars.

03:14.480 --> 03:17.200
A follow up question, Travis McElroy, Space Camp.

03:17.200 --> 03:17.440
Yeah.

03:18.160 --> 03:20.240
Were you actually going to ever do that?

03:22.400 --> 03:22.960
Next question.

03:25.200 --> 03:29.200
I was going to stop war. I wasn't planning on doing war.

03:29.200 --> 03:31.280
Yeah, you said you weren't planning on doing war anymore.

03:32.000 --> 03:36.720
Yeah, I didn't want to. I thought about it for a while and I get it.

03:36.720 --> 03:47.520
You know, you see Black Hawk Down, Zero Dark Thirty, Avatar, The Last Airbender by M.I.

03:47.520 --> 03:51.520
Shyamalan. You see all these military flicks and you're like, fuck yes! Call of Duty,

03:52.080 --> 03:53.280
another big one for me.

03:53.280 --> 03:55.280
More like Call of Duty.

03:55.280 --> 03:58.720
Yeah, you see those and you're like, fuck yes! But then you think about it and you're like,

03:58.720 --> 04:03.840
it's really just a lot of sort of people hurting. So I wasn't going to do that one.

04:03.840 --> 04:06.960
Apparently, I thought that was another hot ticket item.

04:06.960 --> 04:11.120
But, hi, Steve Kurnacki here, MSNBC.

04:11.120 --> 04:12.480
Hi, hi.

04:12.480 --> 04:17.520
I've been moving some of these numbers around and I have, hold on.

04:17.520 --> 04:18.160
Yeah.

04:18.160 --> 04:23.760
OK, yes. This is if you look up here where Griffin's opponent,

04:23.760 --> 04:30.080
Mr. Peanut, currently has 50,000 votes and Griffin had eight.

04:30.080 --> 04:32.560
But if you look at these percentages, the rate these ballots are coming in,

04:32.560 --> 04:36.560
Griffin, I think there's every chance you are going to pull through with a

04:37.680 --> 04:41.840
very viable performance here against Mr. Peanut.

04:41.840 --> 04:46.640
And let me tell you, regardless of how this goes, I'm going to take this.

04:46.640 --> 04:47.520
Uh-huh, wait.

04:47.520 --> 04:48.560
I'm going to take, I'm going to-

04:48.560 --> 04:51.920
Sorry. OK, go, say it again. OK.

04:52.800 --> 04:57.440
That was my producer. I'm sorry. I was actually getting some incorrect information.

04:58.240 --> 05:00.400
It's actually down to seven now.

05:00.400 --> 05:01.680
Oh, he lost a vote.

05:01.680 --> 05:05.360
You lost one vote. You didn't pick up a bunch. You actually lost one.

05:05.360 --> 05:09.520
Like I was saying before you interrupted me, a political guy.

05:10.080 --> 05:10.880
So think about that.

05:11.840 --> 05:16.880
I was saying I'm going to take this case to the extreme court,

05:17.840 --> 05:20.960
which is the next, which is the one higher up.

05:20.960 --> 05:21.920
Here he goes.

05:21.920 --> 05:25.520
Now that's the one where you and Mr. Peanut are going to shred against each other, right?

05:25.520 --> 05:29.760
Yeah. Can we get this guy the fuck out of here?

05:32.400 --> 05:34.160
Hi, Travis McElroy, different Travis McElroy.

05:34.160 --> 05:37.760
He's a ba- I'm going to take this to the extreme court because he's a fucking baby.

05:37.760 --> 05:41.600
I'm sorry for cussing. I know I'm on MSNBC, CBS, and all the big ones, but he's a baby.

05:41.600 --> 05:44.720
Is the extreme court the one where all disputes are settled

05:44.720 --> 05:48.400
via foam jousting rods like in American Gladiators?

05:48.400 --> 05:50.480
Yes, and then we have to do the wipeout course.

05:50.480 --> 05:54.160
Now I made a joke like that and you kicked me out of your press conference.

05:54.160 --> 05:56.160
Well, because you phrased it wrong.

05:56.160 --> 05:58.720
Oh, fuck. Sorry I cursed. I know we're on MSNBC.

05:58.720 --> 06:03.120
Yeah, we're on TV. I think that one's not going to win me any Rust Belt votes.

06:03.760 --> 06:06.480
Now, sorry, Travis McElroy, third Travis McElroy.

06:06.480 --> 06:06.800
Yeah.

06:07.440 --> 06:12.000
Now that you have conceded, would you accept another position in the administration?

06:12.000 --> 06:15.760
Well, I didn't quite concede, did I? I didn't say it, did I?

06:15.760 --> 06:17.360
Oh. Do you concede?

06:18.160 --> 06:18.560
Yeah.

06:20.960 --> 06:21.920
A little mystery.

06:22.640 --> 06:23.360
Yeah, so-

06:23.360 --> 06:25.120
Oh, that makes you very intriguing.

06:25.120 --> 06:28.560
Now I think you're very attractive because of this mystery you've created.

06:28.560 --> 06:29.040
And I'll tell you-

06:29.040 --> 06:32.080
Hi, excuse me. Yes, excuse me, Justin McElroy.

06:32.080 --> 06:34.800
You're interrupting the political guy again, so think about that.

06:34.800 --> 06:38.720
Sorry, I am attempting to abstract this bit so it doesn't become so pointed

06:38.720 --> 06:41.200
as to become in poor taste on Monday,

06:41.200 --> 06:45.280
since we have no idea if Monday will ever come at this point.

06:45.280 --> 06:46.560
Yeah, at this junction.

06:46.560 --> 06:49.120
At this particular junction.

06:49.120 --> 06:52.640
Now I have just Travis McElroy interrupting Justin McElroy,

06:52.640 --> 06:54.080
interrupting the political guy.

06:54.080 --> 06:54.320
Yeah.

06:55.040 --> 07:00.400
Candidate Griffin, do you think that the gargoyles of the gargoyle cartoon

07:00.400 --> 07:06.800
fit into the whole of the fighting mutant animals with abs genre,

07:06.800 --> 07:09.440
or are they a separate kind of entity?

07:10.800 --> 07:14.320
Well, if you read my policy platform, you would know that I do categorize

07:14.320 --> 07:17.600
the gargoyles right alongside the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

07:17.600 --> 07:21.520
and the samurai pizza cats, so-

07:21.520 --> 07:23.360
Do you include the biker mice from Mars

07:23.360 --> 07:25.440
and the mighty ducks in there, sir?

07:25.440 --> 07:26.400
Go to my website.

07:27.120 --> 07:29.680
Go to my website, which I won't say out loud,

07:29.680 --> 07:31.600
because that means Justin will have to buy another website,

07:31.600 --> 07:35.200
but go to my website and you'll see where I stand

07:35.840 --> 07:37.920
on Big Bad Beetleborgs, VR Trooper-

07:37.920 --> 07:39.520
Uh, Cowboys that Move Mesa.

07:39.520 --> 07:40.080
Yes.

07:41.200 --> 07:45.840
Excuse me, I, excuse me, Justin McElroy is my brother.

07:45.840 --> 07:47.280
My name is Travis McElroy.

07:47.280 --> 07:47.520
Whoa.

07:48.240 --> 07:49.440
I don't know much about pot.

07:49.440 --> 07:51.040
What is the Rust Belt?

07:51.040 --> 07:52.720
I'm really embarrassed to ask.

07:52.720 --> 07:53.760
Right, right.

07:53.760 --> 07:55.920
So there was a long time ago.

07:56.480 --> 07:58.400
I'm so glad you asked this question.

07:59.600 --> 08:01.520
I'm so fucking glad you asked this.

08:02.320 --> 08:03.280
What's your name, old guy?

08:04.800 --> 08:06.080
Are you asking me my name?

08:06.080 --> 08:06.880
Yeah, what's your name?

08:08.000 --> 08:09.040
It's Travis McElroy.

08:09.040 --> 08:12.080
My brother, Justin McElroy, of course, knows what the Rust Belt is,

08:12.080 --> 08:15.440
but I didn't know, so I won't ask.

08:15.440 --> 08:16.480
You won't tell me.

08:16.480 --> 08:19.040
This is such a smart little question, little guy.

08:19.040 --> 08:22.320
And I'm proud of you for asking it.

08:22.320 --> 08:25.120
I'm a lawyer, so please don't talk down to me.

08:25.120 --> 08:27.280
Okay, so anyway, back in the day,

08:28.080 --> 08:34.000
there was a few states that did a lot of blacksmithing,

08:35.440 --> 08:37.200
but it rained, didn't it?

08:38.560 --> 08:40.800
What states would you say those were, sir?

08:40.800 --> 08:42.080
The upper ones.

08:42.080 --> 08:43.200
The upper ones.

08:43.200 --> 08:45.920
Mr. Vacheroy, if you could just name some of the states

08:45.920 --> 08:48.960
in that Rust Belt, I'd love to hear.

08:48.960 --> 08:52.160
I feel pretty certain Michigan,

08:52.160 --> 08:55.440
but Michigan is on the border of the country.

08:55.440 --> 08:56.480
It's on the border of the country,

08:56.480 --> 08:58.160
so what kind of belt could that be?

08:58.160 --> 09:00.000
That's not a belt, that's a hat at that point.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.240
It's a rust hat, and I guess it doesn't sound as good.

09:02.240 --> 09:03.920
If it's a belt, it's gotta be in the middle.

09:03.920 --> 09:06.160
That's why Florida is called the dick shoe.

09:06.160 --> 09:08.480
And that's great, Bible Belt, that makes sense,

09:08.480 --> 09:11.120
because it's a belt around the pants of our Florida penis.

09:11.120 --> 09:13.920
Yep, and that's why California is called the fanny pack.

09:13.920 --> 09:17.040
It's right there on the hip, it's where it fits in.

09:17.040 --> 09:20.240
And that's why we call it the Dakotas and Iowa,

09:20.240 --> 09:22.320
that's the bread bowl.

09:22.960 --> 09:24.080
Do you think it's embarrassing?

09:24.080 --> 09:25.920
You could just eat that, you could eat that right up

09:25.920 --> 09:27.760
when you're done with your soups.

09:29.040 --> 09:30.960
Hi, another McElroy brother here.

09:30.960 --> 09:32.480
Do you think it's embarrassing?

09:32.480 --> 09:32.880
What?

09:32.880 --> 09:33.840
Which one?

09:33.840 --> 09:34.240
Gillip.

09:34.960 --> 09:37.360
Hi, Gillip McElroy, do you think it's embarrassing

09:37.360 --> 09:38.800
that apparently Charleston, West Virginia,

09:38.800 --> 09:40.960
which is just 40 miles from our hometown,

09:40.960 --> 09:42.400
is apparently part of the Rust Belt,

09:42.400 --> 09:44.000
and you were not aware of this fact?

09:44.000 --> 09:44.880
Do you find that embarrassing?

09:44.880 --> 09:47.120
Wait, just Charleston though, not Huntington?

09:47.760 --> 09:48.480
No, no, no, no.

09:48.480 --> 09:49.680
Oh, we didn't make it.

09:49.680 --> 09:51.680
You have to have had production at one point.

09:51.680 --> 09:53.520
Ah, okay.

09:54.400 --> 09:56.560
Well, I did not say it wasn't.

09:57.200 --> 10:02.800
So I do concede, and I'm done, but catch me out there

10:02.800 --> 10:03.920
on the trail.

10:03.920 --> 10:06.720
You're retreating to your original campaign slogan,

10:06.720 --> 10:10.160
which was, I did not say it wasn't McElroy 2020.

10:10.160 --> 10:10.800
Exactly.

10:11.680 --> 10:14.160
I don't like the idea of it just being separate towns,

10:14.160 --> 10:15.600
uh, like, sprinkled around,

10:15.600 --> 10:17.040
because that sounds like rust freckles.

10:17.840 --> 10:18.480
Sure.

10:18.480 --> 10:20.640
I'm just saying these two fucking guys are up there,

10:20.640 --> 10:21.600
like, rah!

10:21.600 --> 10:22.960
No, you, rah!

10:22.960 --> 10:24.720
And I'm over here, like, chilling.

10:24.720 --> 10:26.800
So I guess where do you want to,

10:26.800 --> 10:28.560
where is your loyalties lie?

10:28.560 --> 10:29.600
My name is Griffin McElroy.

10:29.600 --> 10:30.560
I approve this message.

10:30.560 --> 10:31.680
I unconcede.

10:31.680 --> 10:32.400
Come and get it.

10:32.400 --> 10:32.640
Oh.

10:33.440 --> 10:33.920
Come and get it.

10:33.920 --> 10:34.800
That's the new slogan.

10:34.800 --> 10:35.600
Come and get it.

10:35.600 --> 10:36.800
You're $100,000.

10:37.840 --> 10:39.840
I'm going to take all the healthcare away.

10:39.840 --> 10:41.120
All the healthcare is going to go away,

10:41.120 --> 10:41.760
but guess what?

10:41.760 --> 10:44.560
I'm also going to get rid of all illness.

10:45.760 --> 10:46.560
Wow.

10:46.560 --> 10:48.720
Everyone will be invulnerable.

10:48.720 --> 10:50.800
Hi, uh, Travis McElroy, Travis McElroy Monthly.

10:50.800 --> 10:51.040
Go ahead.

10:51.040 --> 10:52.960
I've decided to throw my hat in the ring,

10:52.960 --> 10:54.400
and now I'm running too.

10:54.400 --> 10:55.280
Get on up here then.

10:55.280 --> 10:55.920
Get on up here.

10:55.920 --> 10:56.640
Okay, thank you.

10:57.840 --> 10:58.960
All right, excuse me.

10:58.960 --> 11:00.400
Hold on, I'm getting on stage.

11:00.400 --> 11:02.560
I'm a political guy now and you can't interrupt me.

11:02.560 --> 11:04.800
You can't talk to us political guys like that.

11:04.800 --> 11:06.240
And now as a political guy,

11:06.240 --> 11:09.520
I'm willing to give every American family $1 million

11:09.520 --> 11:11.760
Whoa, that's so much more than me.

11:11.760 --> 11:13.840
If they can find me.

11:14.640 --> 11:16.720
Oh, yeah.

11:16.720 --> 11:17.840
Rat race.

11:17.840 --> 11:20.080
I've given you all the clues.

11:20.800 --> 11:22.560
This guy rules.

11:22.560 --> 11:24.240
Now you'll have to find me.

11:24.240 --> 11:28.240
Second place gets a Jelly Belly factory that I do not own.

11:28.800 --> 11:29.360
All right.

11:30.240 --> 11:32.080
Third place, big smooch.

11:32.960 --> 11:37.600
Oh, but now the momentum's gone, I feel like.

11:37.600 --> 11:40.640
Well, depends on how much you value a smooch.

11:40.640 --> 11:42.320
So right now, I guess Justin,

11:42.320 --> 11:44.000
you're the only person in the room.

11:44.000 --> 11:44.560
Vote.

11:44.560 --> 11:45.600
Hey, excuse me.

11:45.600 --> 11:47.040
My name's Roger Dinkins.

11:47.040 --> 11:48.160
I built that stage.

11:48.160 --> 11:50.480
Oh, it's not rated for two people.

11:50.480 --> 11:51.040
You gotta get off.

11:51.040 --> 11:51.680
Oh, no.

11:55.520 --> 11:56.160
Oh, God.

11:57.920 --> 11:59.200
Oh, God, no.

11:59.920 --> 12:01.200
It's taking so long.

12:01.200 --> 12:02.160
Oh, no.

12:03.040 --> 12:05.040
Why did we build the stage so tall?

12:05.040 --> 12:08.080
Oh, God, almighty and heaven of Jesus, no.

12:08.080 --> 12:09.600
You're falling on me.

12:11.360 --> 12:12.080
I'm ruined.

12:16.160 --> 12:17.200
What a whoopsie, right?

12:17.200 --> 12:20.080
Did you guys ever see Kelsey Grammer did one of those?

12:20.080 --> 12:20.960
Oh, yeah.

12:20.960 --> 12:21.440
Oh, yeah.

12:21.440 --> 12:21.840
That's my new-

12:21.840 --> 12:26.400
I don't think he collapsed the stage to bring a Niles crane up on the-

12:26.400 --> 12:27.760
No, that actually is what happened.

12:27.760 --> 12:31.440
He fell off the stage and then he was so angry he smashed it.

12:31.440 --> 12:34.880
My new policy platform I think I'm gonna run with in 2024.

12:34.880 --> 12:36.880
2022, I could do a Senate one.

12:36.880 --> 12:40.320
Is that one time that Kelsey Grammer fell off the stage.

12:40.320 --> 12:46.240
I refuse to let this degrade our great institution of my brother, my brother, me any longer.

12:46.240 --> 12:48.000
You guys ever thought about doing a Senate?

12:48.000 --> 12:49.200
I've thought about doing a Senate.

12:49.200 --> 12:50.880
I'm not talking about politics anymore.

12:50.880 --> 12:52.720
I think I'd be a good Senator.

12:52.720 --> 12:58.240
I have to prove to myself that my brain can process information that is not about politics

12:58.240 --> 12:58.480
currently.

12:58.480 --> 12:59.520
Probably not gonna.

12:59.520 --> 13:06.880
For reference, my friends, try to flashback as you're listening to this to Friday, November

13:06.880 --> 13:09.040
6th at 2 51 p.m.

13:10.320 --> 13:13.440
Here's how distracted we are by what is happening in this world right now.

13:14.320 --> 13:14.720
We did-

13:15.600 --> 13:20.480
You are listening to this after Travis and my birthday that we shared.

13:20.480 --> 13:20.960
Aw, shit.

13:20.960 --> 13:22.800
We did not make the opener about that.

13:22.800 --> 13:23.840
And now it's too late.

13:23.840 --> 13:25.760
No, we're still special birthday boys though, right?

13:25.760 --> 13:26.560
No, we're not.

13:26.560 --> 13:26.800
Fuck!

13:26.800 --> 13:29.200
We talked about politics and we fucked up.

13:29.200 --> 13:29.520
All right.

13:29.520 --> 13:29.840
Fuck!

13:30.400 --> 13:30.720
Yep.

13:31.440 --> 13:33.600
And I was- and I was turning 29.

13:33.600 --> 13:34.320
And I'm-

13:34.320 --> 13:34.640
Wink!

13:34.640 --> 13:35.520
23.

13:35.520 --> 13:35.840
Wink!

13:36.960 --> 13:37.920
Wink wink!

13:37.920 --> 13:38.480
I'm eight.

13:39.200 --> 13:39.520
Whoa.

13:40.400 --> 13:42.160
Give me all your jelly beans.

13:43.440 --> 13:45.840
Can ice has jelly beans, mister?

13:46.400 --> 13:50.880
Okay, recently while my roommate was away for the weekend, I executed a crafting endeavor

13:50.880 --> 13:55.600
which required me to stick my recently purchased silicone kitchen tongs into a melted Bath and

13:55.600 --> 13:56.880
Body Works candle.

13:56.880 --> 13:59.200
I washed them afterwards and put them back where they belong.

13:59.200 --> 14:03.120
A few days later when my roommate was back, I made some dinner for the two of us using

14:03.120 --> 14:05.600
the tongs and the entire meal tasted faintly of this candle.

14:05.600 --> 14:06.480
Whoops!

14:06.480 --> 14:07.600
Whoops-a-do.

14:07.600 --> 14:10.720
I don't think my roommate noticed, otherwise he would have said something.

14:10.720 --> 14:11.920
I'm at a crossroads.

14:11.920 --> 14:14.960
Do I tell my roommate about what happened and replace the brand new tongs?

14:14.960 --> 14:18.320
Or do I keep them and continue to have my meals taste like mahogany coconut?

14:18.320 --> 14:19.920
That's some shameful champagne.

14:19.920 --> 14:20.400
What's wrong with you?

14:20.400 --> 14:26.880
This fucking rules because I'm imagining this is a sort of performance art where it's like,

14:26.880 --> 14:30.720
hey, has anybody seen my NutriBullet?

14:31.600 --> 14:33.520
Has anybody seen my Slap Chop?

14:33.520 --> 14:36.320
I really don't want to mess with these onions right now.

14:36.320 --> 14:39.200
And you can be like, oh, that?

14:39.200 --> 14:41.600
I did dip it in Gak for art.

14:41.600 --> 14:42.160
Mm-hmm.

14:42.160 --> 14:42.720
Yep.

14:42.720 --> 14:43.760
Now you don't have it.

14:43.760 --> 14:44.400
I miss it.

14:44.400 --> 14:44.960
I know.

14:44.960 --> 14:45.920
And that's an emotion.

14:45.920 --> 14:47.120
So technically we did art.

14:47.120 --> 14:52.640
Question asker, you've given us very limited information about the project you are working on.

14:52.640 --> 14:58.000
All we really know is, and I'm going to use this word with quotation marks around it,

14:58.000 --> 15:03.200
it required you to dip your tongs into a candle?

15:03.200 --> 15:06.400
Not doing that wasn't an option.

15:06.400 --> 15:07.440
Had to be done.

15:07.440 --> 15:10.080
So what were the following steps?

15:10.080 --> 15:12.880
Did you put something in the candle you were trying to retrieve?

15:12.880 --> 15:16.000
Or was this like a, you know, when you stick your hands in something?

15:16.000 --> 15:20.080
No, they were dipping something into the wax to coat it in wax.

15:20.640 --> 15:23.600
And they were getting it out with the tongs, because they didn't plan ahead.

15:23.600 --> 15:24.640
And I know what that's like.

15:24.640 --> 15:26.400
I know what that's like.

15:26.400 --> 15:27.840
Seems like a bad idea.

15:27.840 --> 15:29.360
I've done this project before.

15:29.360 --> 15:35.280
I used my silicone, you know, a rubber brush.

15:35.280 --> 15:36.240
Which one is it?

15:36.240 --> 15:37.120
We don't know.

15:37.120 --> 15:39.440
A rubber basting brush to spread wood glue.

15:39.440 --> 15:42.320
It's a great way of spreading wood glue around because it peels right off.

15:42.320 --> 15:45.680
But that's the only one I had, and I had to spread some butter on it.

15:45.680 --> 15:47.440
Delicious something.

15:48.000 --> 15:52.240
And I was a little bit embarrassed because it was the one that I had used to spread wood glue.

15:52.240 --> 15:53.680
But it was fine.

15:53.680 --> 15:55.200
Wait, how was it fine?

15:55.760 --> 15:57.200
Because here I am.

15:57.920 --> 15:59.360
That's not fine, Justin.

15:59.920 --> 16:01.600
Hey, here I am.

16:01.600 --> 16:05.680
Some of his inside parts are pretty stuck together.

16:05.680 --> 16:08.160
I got a few miles on the odometer.

16:08.160 --> 16:10.160
I'm not going to lie to them.

16:10.160 --> 16:10.880
I'm doing fine.

16:10.880 --> 16:14.560
So if you're listening to this, I made it to 40 probably.

16:14.560 --> 16:15.360
How about that?

16:15.360 --> 16:19.120
So your point about being fine is that you're still kicking.

16:19.120 --> 16:19.680
And so...

16:20.560 --> 16:21.360
Baby, I'm kicking.

16:21.360 --> 16:21.920
I'm punching.

16:21.920 --> 16:22.640
I'm doing everything.

16:23.280 --> 16:24.240
Age is just a number.

16:24.240 --> 16:25.680
It's not going to slow me down.

16:25.680 --> 16:27.040
Age isn't just a number.

16:27.040 --> 16:29.280
Just to point out, it's the amount of time you've been on earth.

16:29.280 --> 16:30.400
It's counting something.

16:30.400 --> 16:31.920
It's not just a number.

16:31.920 --> 16:36.240
I'm worried, Juice, more about in the future if you have to have an appendectomy or something

16:36.240 --> 16:38.720
like that and the doctor's got you open and it's like,

16:38.720 --> 16:41.040
oh, there's that little naughty boy.

16:41.040 --> 16:42.240
And they go to pull it out and it's like,

16:42.240 --> 16:48.720
oh, fuck, this thing's glued to his ribs.

16:48.720 --> 16:49.760
Where's the appendix?

16:49.760 --> 16:50.240
Nobody knows.

16:50.240 --> 16:51.280
Yeah, it's glued to the ribs.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.040
It is now.

16:53.040 --> 16:56.400
They pull it out and it kind of sproing back in.

16:56.400 --> 16:56.640
Yeah.

16:57.840 --> 16:59.120
Do you want a yahoo?

16:59.120 --> 16:59.680
I'd love that.

16:59.680 --> 17:01.440
Well, what to do with these tongs?

17:02.480 --> 17:03.360
Put them in heat.

17:04.720 --> 17:05.920
Throw these tongs away.

17:05.920 --> 17:06.240
You're never going to get this.

17:06.240 --> 17:07.280
Don't throw these tongs away.

17:07.280 --> 17:07.760
Save these.

17:07.760 --> 17:08.880
These are craft tongs.

17:08.880 --> 17:10.640
Yeah, these are your art tongs now.

17:10.640 --> 17:11.680
They're art tongs.

17:11.680 --> 17:12.320
Put them aside.

17:12.320 --> 17:13.200
Get some new tongs.

17:14.560 --> 17:17.680
Get a new pair of tongs as a present for your roommate with a little ribbon on it.

17:17.680 --> 17:18.800
And they'll say, why did you do this?

17:19.360 --> 17:22.720
You don't want to know the answer to that question, but just appreciate it.

17:22.720 --> 17:25.920
Hey, listen, you can't do what Justin just said because it'll make it sound like you

17:25.920 --> 17:27.520
use the old tongs for a sex thing.

17:29.840 --> 17:30.960
We don't know.

17:30.960 --> 17:31.840
They're using candle wax.

17:31.840 --> 17:33.680
We don't know that it wasn't a sex thing.

17:33.680 --> 17:34.640
This is absolutely true.

17:34.640 --> 17:39.200
But if you say to your roommate, I'm sorry, you can't use the tongs anymore and I can't

17:39.200 --> 17:42.880
tell you why, they're not going to be like, dip them in a candle, huh?

17:42.880 --> 17:44.560
They'll assume the worst, yeah.

17:44.560 --> 17:49.360
I guess you could, like, you can use them for grilling corn, but it is also a sort of

17:50.720 --> 17:51.920
makeshift speculum situation.

17:51.920 --> 17:53.840
No more food applique.

17:53.840 --> 17:54.080
Yeah.

17:54.080 --> 17:54.720
No more.

17:54.720 --> 17:55.520
Get new tongs.

17:55.520 --> 17:56.560
Those are craft tongs now.

17:56.560 --> 17:59.200
Do you guys, I think this is a pretty universal thing.

17:59.200 --> 18:06.880
We had, for about an hour and a half, two pairs of scissors and one was, I don't know

18:06.880 --> 18:12.640
how to put this, but like, not raw meat scissors and the other ones was raw meat scissors.

18:13.520 --> 18:18.240
But we got those and I was all stoked and I put them in the scissors drawer and then

18:18.240 --> 18:23.280
the first time that I needed to open a packet of bacon, the raw meat scissors were gone.

18:23.280 --> 18:30.720
And I was like, well, non-raw meat scissors, today you will be baptized in pig fat.

18:30.720 --> 18:32.000
And I'm so, so sorry.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.240
I don't want to brag, I got three pairs of scissors.

18:34.240 --> 18:39.360
I got raw meat scissors, I have normal kitchen scissors, and then I got the sharp boys.

18:39.360 --> 18:40.320
Oh yeah.

18:40.320 --> 18:43.280
Oh, when you need the sharp and you need that clean zip.

18:43.280 --> 18:48.000
Don't you hate when you see your kids using the sharp boys for crafts and cutting paper?

18:48.000 --> 18:49.680
Please don't do that, that's for chicken.

18:49.680 --> 18:51.760
No, them's my sharp boys.

18:51.760 --> 18:56.400
We got this question sent in by so many people and it's not the, it's weird because it's

18:56.400 --> 18:58.080
not usually the kind of question we do.

18:58.080 --> 19:02.000
It's almost a, this is almost a backdoor riddle me piss.

19:03.280 --> 19:04.720
So yeah, I know Travis would be excited.

19:04.720 --> 19:11.280
It's from a Yahoo Answers user, Riley, who asks, how to fill a water bed quickly

19:11.280 --> 19:13.920
and then in parentheses, no hose.

19:14.480 --> 19:15.600
Oh, okay.

19:15.600 --> 19:21.440
Ooh, all right, the situation, my roommate is currently out of town for the weekend and

19:21.440 --> 19:22.640
is visit, whoa, weird.

19:23.440 --> 19:25.920
Isn't that how the last actual question started?

19:25.920 --> 19:28.080
Yes, I have a pair of tongs and a candle.

19:28.080 --> 19:28.640
What can I do?

19:30.080 --> 19:32.720
My roommate is visiting her family for her birthday.

19:32.720 --> 19:36.080
As a thoughtful gesture, I thought I would get her a used water bed for her birthday

19:36.080 --> 19:38.240
as she stated several times that she wants one.

19:38.240 --> 19:42.160
The thing I failed to realize, however, when purchasing the behemoth queen size water bed

19:42.880 --> 19:44.560
is that it doesn't come prefilled.

19:44.560 --> 19:48.560
I am now stuck, I'm now stuck with a large plastic sack sitting on my living room floor.

19:48.560 --> 19:51.520
My roommate is coming back in two days and I have no idea how I'm going to get this awful

19:51.520 --> 19:54.160
mistake filled before she gets home.

19:54.160 --> 19:56.240
How do I mend this terrible soggy situation?

19:56.240 --> 20:00.400
Do I explain it to her and live with the shame of my aquatic misery or is there another solution?

20:00.400 --> 20:02.800
This almost sounds like I'm a bim bam question.

20:02.800 --> 20:04.880
The answer is obvious.

20:04.880 --> 20:07.920
With no hose, no hose, no hose, no hose.

20:07.920 --> 20:13.520
I know you're going to buy a second water bed that's full, tape them together and then

20:13.520 --> 20:18.720
jump on the full one so that it fills the empty one.

20:18.720 --> 20:18.960
Boom.

20:18.960 --> 20:19.440
That's good.

20:20.560 --> 20:21.200
Okay.

20:21.200 --> 20:23.440
Next question now.

20:23.440 --> 20:24.560
It's not bad actually.

20:25.760 --> 20:26.320
You take it.

20:26.320 --> 20:27.600
But can I ask you a question?

20:27.600 --> 20:27.840
Yeah.

20:27.840 --> 20:28.720
About practicality.

20:28.720 --> 20:29.040
Uh-huh.

20:30.800 --> 20:31.280
What's wrong?

20:32.000 --> 20:32.880
Well, Tariff.

20:32.880 --> 20:33.120
Yeah?

20:33.920 --> 20:36.880
Once you've bought, excuse me, once you bought a full water bed.

20:36.880 --> 20:38.080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:38.080 --> 20:42.800
To why the job is done.

20:42.800 --> 20:43.680
No.

20:43.680 --> 20:43.920
No.

20:43.920 --> 20:44.560
Because the one you bought-

20:44.560 --> 20:48.800
If this person knew where to buy full water beds, they probably would have done that.

20:49.600 --> 20:52.800
The one you bought isn't cool.

20:52.800 --> 20:55.040
Well, no, the one that they bought was used, right?

20:55.040 --> 20:56.480
And so they got that for a song.

20:57.040 --> 21:03.680
If they got a full water bed from one of these big box water bed stores, they could take

21:03.680 --> 21:04.400
it to their house.

21:05.040 --> 21:06.240
They paid an arm and a leg for it.

21:06.240 --> 21:08.000
They really just need the water.

21:08.000 --> 21:08.240
Yeah.

21:08.240 --> 21:13.760
So they do the sort of blood transfusion and then they bring back a wadded up

21:14.880 --> 21:19.120
empty garbage bag of a bed and they say, I don't want this anymore.

21:19.760 --> 21:22.480
And they'll say, what happened to all the water that was in it?

21:23.120 --> 21:24.080
And you say-

21:24.080 --> 21:25.360
You say evaporated.

21:25.360 --> 21:27.680
You say desert band, you say desert bandits.

21:27.680 --> 21:27.920
Yep.

21:28.480 --> 21:28.800
They fucking got me again.

21:28.800 --> 21:31.200
Can I just say that if I bought Mad Max Desert Bandits-

21:31.200 --> 21:34.400
Mad Max Desert Bandits came to my house, drank up all my damn water bed.

21:34.400 --> 21:35.680
I witnessed them.

21:35.680 --> 21:36.000
Yep.

21:36.000 --> 21:36.640
I saw it.

21:36.640 --> 21:37.120
Wasn't enough?

21:37.120 --> 21:38.800
My own two dry eyes.

21:39.760 --> 21:44.160
I just want to say if I bought a used water bed and it came with used water, that would

21:44.160 --> 21:45.440
be probably the worst.

21:46.960 --> 21:50.000
Because I don't know what that water has seen or heard.

21:50.960 --> 21:53.440
Well, water, can't see or hear anything.

21:53.440 --> 21:54.640
And I feel like it's-

21:54.640 --> 21:56.160
There's microbes in water, they know.

21:56.160 --> 21:57.200
We're not gonna do that.

21:57.200 --> 21:58.480
Have you played Spores?

21:58.480 --> 22:01.360
Water does not have a memory, no matter what Frozen 2 told you.

22:01.360 --> 22:02.960
Fucking Olaf says it does.

22:02.960 --> 22:06.960
So, but it is waterproof and that goes both ways, Trav.

22:06.960 --> 22:08.720
So that water is not coming out.

22:08.720 --> 22:14.160
If you do, you could do the nastiest, jizziest sort of scenario on there.

22:14.160 --> 22:14.560
Whoa.

22:14.560 --> 22:17.120
And it's not gonna get in the water bed.

22:17.120 --> 22:18.880
So water bed water is fine.

22:18.880 --> 22:20.080
Once it's in there, it's fine.

22:20.960 --> 22:24.080
That is a good way to store water for the apocalypse, if you think about it.

22:24.080 --> 22:24.080
If you think about it-

22:24.080 --> 22:26.320
Make sure to stare eye, I'll put it in there.

22:26.320 --> 22:28.080
That'll last you a couple days at least.

22:29.920 --> 22:31.920
Yeah, so I think-

22:31.920 --> 22:32.720
That wasn't a joke.

22:32.720 --> 22:34.720
That's just a prepper tip from me to you.

22:34.720 --> 22:35.280
Yeah, thank you.

22:35.280 --> 22:36.080
Oh God, with this stuff.

22:36.080 --> 22:40.160
I'm just saying keep rice on hand, but keep it in small bags so that raiders don't know

22:40.160 --> 22:41.440
how much rice you got.

22:41.440 --> 22:42.400
Those fucking desert bandits.

22:42.400 --> 22:46.000
If they see your big barrel of rice, they're gonna know that they need to steal from you.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.960
Maybe they're gonna see that bed and their eyes are gonna go blue.

22:48.960 --> 22:50.720
They're gonna go wild for your bed.

22:50.720 --> 22:52.880
Maybe just fill that water bed with some rice.

22:53.600 --> 22:57.840
Oh, two water beds, one with water, another one with poison water.

22:57.840 --> 22:59.600
Oh, that's good.

22:59.600 --> 23:00.240
And the ban-

23:00.240 --> 23:03.920
I guess you could just have one with poison water, as long as you don't drink.

23:03.920 --> 23:04.560
Ah, man.

23:04.560 --> 23:06.960
Well, here's another question.

23:06.960 --> 23:11.040
While grocery shopping with my mom, I started feeling chilly from the blast of fall AC.

23:11.680 --> 23:15.440
I remarked how jokingly that I could go to the clothing aisle and wear a jacket for the

23:15.440 --> 23:16.800
rest of our shopping trip.

23:16.800 --> 23:18.880
She looked at me offended and chided me for this idea.

23:18.880 --> 23:22.240
But the more we discussed it, the more I started to think it was a genuinely good solution

23:22.240 --> 23:23.360
to my chattering teeth.

23:23.360 --> 23:28.640
Her arguments were, I raised you better, you don't know who else wore it, and it's dishonest.

23:28.640 --> 23:32.960
Brothers, when things are safer, would it be acceptable for me to wear a jacket without

23:32.960 --> 23:34.240
the intent of purchasing it?

23:34.240 --> 23:35.920
Was my mother right to dissuade me?

23:35.920 --> 23:38.000
That's from Shivering Sister in Florida.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.200
God, I gotta think on this one.

23:39.200 --> 23:39.920
Okay, this is-

23:39.920 --> 23:40.560
I like this-

23:40.560 --> 23:42.160
You're just springing right into it.

23:42.160 --> 23:46.880
This is like, it's so rare that we- apologies get a good question, and I really need to

23:46.880 --> 23:47.600
think on this one.

23:47.600 --> 23:52.560
Well, what I like, the reason I'm jumping into it is the mother has presented three

23:52.560 --> 23:55.200
counter-arguments that I feel like we can discuss.

23:55.200 --> 23:57.040
And right off the bat, let's start with number one.

23:57.040 --> 23:58.240
I raised you better.

23:58.240 --> 23:59.120
Clearly not.

23:59.120 --> 23:59.760
No, you didn't.

23:59.760 --> 24:00.320
Yeah, clearly not.

24:00.320 --> 24:01.520
Proof's in the pudding.

24:01.520 --> 24:02.080
Okay.

24:02.080 --> 24:04.800
Second one, someone else could have worn it.

24:05.360 --> 24:12.160
Now, I can't deny that, but what are the odds because it's still hanging up in the store?

24:12.960 --> 24:14.320
Well, that doesn't mean anything.

24:14.320 --> 24:17.840
I mean, could is the operative word here, and I think this argument has to stand.

24:17.840 --> 24:18.960
Someone else could have worn it.

24:18.960 --> 24:21.120
But that's true of my jacket hanging in my closet right now.

24:21.120 --> 24:21.920
Exactly.

24:21.920 --> 24:22.880
Correct, yes.

24:22.880 --> 24:24.800
So we will dismiss it on those grounds.

24:24.800 --> 24:25.520
Okay.

24:25.520 --> 24:27.040
Finally, it's dishonest.

24:28.080 --> 24:29.680
Now, this is the nut, isn't it?

24:29.680 --> 24:30.960
Mm-hmm.

24:30.960 --> 24:33.680
I cracked open this white chocolate M&M, and here's the nut inside.

24:36.080 --> 24:37.120
It's not, though.

24:38.080 --> 24:38.560
It's not.

24:39.360 --> 24:40.800
You're not hiding it.

24:40.800 --> 24:44.320
I used to really, really wrestle with this because we all have those little demons.

24:44.320 --> 24:45.040
We all have our-

24:45.040 --> 24:46.720
Our dark passengers.

24:46.720 --> 24:51.840
Our little, just our little imps and pixies riding around inside of our mind trying to

24:51.840 --> 24:53.920
make us do stuff that we don't want to do.

24:53.920 --> 24:59.200
And sometimes, you know, when I was younger and at the grocery store, and, you know,

24:59.200 --> 25:02.000
I was peckish or really, really thirsty.

25:02.000 --> 25:02.960
That's a big one.

25:02.960 --> 25:06.960
And I'm in the checkout aisle, and there's just Diet Mountain Dew right there.

25:07.520 --> 25:10.480
So I'm going to crack it open, even though I haven't legally bought it yet.

25:10.480 --> 25:13.680
I would never do that, even though it's probably just fine.

25:14.240 --> 25:19.120
But now I feel like that's not a concern of mine because back when we, you know, we're

25:19.120 --> 25:23.200
going to the grocery store with our child as like a fun family activity, we'd roll up

25:23.200 --> 25:28.240
in a Trader Joe's, and I would just grab me some pumpkin jojos and just rip them and grip

25:28.240 --> 25:29.120
them, baby.

25:29.120 --> 25:31.920
Start feeding them whole fistfuls into me and my son's face.

25:32.880 --> 25:35.120
Okay, but here's the difference, though, Griffin.

25:35.120 --> 25:39.920
If you open a drink and start drinking it, you have irreparably used up some of that.

25:39.920 --> 25:44.000
If I put a jacket on and then take it off, I used up nothing.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.120
I'm saying it's fine.

25:45.120 --> 25:47.040
I'm saying it's fucking totally fine.

25:47.760 --> 25:48.560
Do you know how many times-

25:48.560 --> 25:53.760
I used to exclusively buy my clothes at Target through all of college.

25:53.760 --> 25:59.600
And that's not a judgment, but it is a fact that I went to Target many, many times wearing

25:59.600 --> 26:00.560
Target clothes.

26:01.200 --> 26:03.600
And nobody fucking called the cops on me.

26:03.600 --> 26:07.120
Fucking Isaac Mizrahi didn't kick the door in like, fucking drop it.

26:07.120 --> 26:08.800
Like, it didn't happen.

26:08.800 --> 26:09.840
Those are my sweats.

26:10.880 --> 26:11.600
There's a bubble.

26:12.320 --> 26:19.840
There's a bubble where you can try clothes on and it's within three feet of the, you

26:19.840 --> 26:24.960
know, the hanging place, which sounds more ghoulish now that I've said it like that.

26:24.960 --> 26:31.280
And within like three feet of the dressing rooms.

26:31.280 --> 26:32.480
And other than that, you can't.

26:32.480 --> 26:34.560
You can't just take it for a test driver or walk out.

26:34.560 --> 26:36.640
Why not, Justin?

26:36.640 --> 26:39.920
Because it's not a fucking library.

26:39.920 --> 26:43.840
You can't take a coat out for a spin around the store.

26:43.840 --> 26:44.880
That's shoplifting.

26:44.880 --> 26:49.840
You're using it for the primary utility that it is intended for.

26:49.840 --> 26:53.840
If you're using it to warm your body, you are stealing.

26:53.840 --> 26:58.080
Oh, so if I go to Best Buy and I stand in front of one of the TVs and watch a scene

26:58.080 --> 27:00.320
from Mr. Deeds, I'm stealing?

27:00.320 --> 27:02.960
Because I'm using the TV for its intended purpose?

27:02.960 --> 27:04.320
I don't believe that you can-

27:04.320 --> 27:07.680
Because stealing, it has to be some-

27:07.680 --> 27:09.760
I'm saying that with something physical, right?

27:10.400 --> 27:11.040
It's physical.

27:11.040 --> 27:12.080
You're stealing it.

27:12.080 --> 27:13.760
And now actually my argument's falling apart.

27:13.760 --> 27:14.080
Hold on.

27:14.080 --> 27:15.120
I gotta think about this.

27:15.120 --> 27:15.680
Think about it.

27:15.680 --> 27:17.120
The Mr. Deeds thing was actually very good.

27:17.120 --> 27:18.240
It was really good.

27:18.240 --> 27:20.800
I'm saying if I pick up the coat, if I pick up the jacket-

27:20.800 --> 27:22.160
Yes, it is stealing.

27:22.160 --> 27:25.760
If you enjoy Mr. Deeds on a TV that happens in front of Best Buy,

27:25.760 --> 27:30.000
you have stolen the joy that you should be paying Mr. Sandler for.

27:30.000 --> 27:30.800
So that's a trap.

27:30.800 --> 27:32.320
That's entrapment is what you're saying.

27:32.320 --> 27:38.560
Mr. Sandler's films operate on a sort of scarcity commercial sort of scheme

27:38.560 --> 27:43.840
where you are spending money to fill the Mr. Deeds gap in your life.

27:43.840 --> 27:49.360
And when you do that for free in the technology aisle of your store,

27:49.360 --> 27:52.080
then that need no longer exists in Mr. Sandler.

27:52.080 --> 27:52.720
You're robbing.

27:52.720 --> 27:55.280
You're fucking robbing him at gunpoint.

27:56.480 --> 27:58.400
Okay, here's what I'm saying.

27:58.400 --> 28:01.440
I pick up the jacket, I put it in the cart.

28:01.440 --> 28:02.640
That's fine.

28:02.640 --> 28:04.720
I pick up the jacket, I put it on my body.

28:04.720 --> 28:06.000
That's not okay?

28:06.000 --> 28:07.360
Correct, because that's stealing.

28:07.360 --> 28:07.920
That's shopping.

28:07.920 --> 28:09.600
No, you know what that is?

28:09.600 --> 28:11.680
That's preconceived notions, my friend.

28:11.680 --> 28:13.120
And I'm here to break those down.

28:13.120 --> 28:14.240
Let me ask you a question, Trav.

28:15.840 --> 28:18.640
You've worked in the loss prevention field, correct?

28:18.640 --> 28:19.520
Yes, I have.

28:19.520 --> 28:20.240
Okay.

28:20.240 --> 28:25.120
If you worked at a jacket store and you watched someone put on a jacket

28:25.120 --> 28:29.280
and then kind of walk away from where that was,

28:30.000 --> 28:32.640
what would you think they were doing?

28:32.640 --> 28:33.920
I would think they were stealing, Justin,

28:33.920 --> 28:36.080
but I have preconceived notions is what I'm saying.

28:36.080 --> 28:38.160
I would look at them and I'd be like, oh, that person's stealing.

28:38.160 --> 28:38.880
But you know what?

28:39.600 --> 28:41.520
This is what I learned in loss prevention.

28:41.520 --> 28:44.640
I wouldn't do anything until they attempted to leave

28:45.440 --> 28:47.680
through the doors with said jacket on.

28:47.680 --> 28:49.600
See, that is what I would do accidentally.

28:49.600 --> 28:52.480
And I really can't introduce to my life the more possibilities

28:52.480 --> 28:54.480
that I will accidentally do a crime,

28:54.480 --> 28:57.280
because it is something I think about a good amount.

28:57.280 --> 28:58.160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

28:58.160 --> 28:59.200
Don't want to open the door to that.

28:59.200 --> 29:02.640
That is my number one fear in life is that I will accidentally murder someone

29:02.640 --> 29:04.800
because I watched too many episodes of CSI.

29:04.800 --> 29:06.480
God, I would hate doing that.

29:06.480 --> 29:06.800
Right?

29:06.800 --> 29:09.600
Can you imagine how embarrassed you would be if someone saw

29:09.600 --> 29:11.280
and they were like, hey, did you just kill that guy?

29:11.280 --> 29:14.160
And you're like, oh, oh, shit, I did.

29:14.720 --> 29:15.600
Oh, man.

29:15.600 --> 29:16.400
What is this?

29:16.400 --> 29:17.360
This is arsenic?

29:17.360 --> 29:18.800
I thought it was coffee mate.

29:18.800 --> 29:19.440
Shoot.

29:19.440 --> 29:20.880
Oh, beans.

29:20.880 --> 29:22.720
You're not going to tell anybody, are you?

29:23.440 --> 29:25.280
We're going to keep this between us, right?

29:26.080 --> 29:29.600
I think this is the official ruling of all three of us on this podcast.

29:29.600 --> 29:34.160
It's all good as long as there's no BO, dude.

29:35.600 --> 29:39.200
I think that this is a Schrodinger's cat scenario.

29:39.200 --> 29:41.280
It's fine unless you are observed.

29:41.840 --> 29:43.120
And then it is wrong.

29:43.120 --> 29:44.240
I'm just saying do a-

29:44.240 --> 29:45.600
That's all shoplifting.

29:46.480 --> 29:46.720
No.

29:47.520 --> 29:48.400
But it's all fine.

29:49.200 --> 29:50.320
It's all fine.

29:50.320 --> 29:50.880
Oh.

29:50.880 --> 29:53.520
It's all fine as long as there's no BO, dude.

29:55.200 --> 29:56.240
Nobody thinks they have it.

29:57.440 --> 29:58.000
Just check it.

29:58.000 --> 29:59.360
Everybody thinks it's fine in there.

29:59.360 --> 30:00.160
Check the jacket.

30:00.800 --> 30:01.520
Check yourself.

30:02.320 --> 30:03.440
Before you wreck yourself.

30:03.440 --> 30:06.080
And it's fine to wear it when you're cold.

30:06.080 --> 30:08.640
As long as there's no BO, dude.

30:08.640 --> 30:11.600
But that's actually what it says on all the signage in Target.

30:11.600 --> 30:12.160
Yep.

30:13.360 --> 30:14.560
Check out these mugs.

30:14.560 --> 30:16.480
As long as there's no BO, dude.

30:17.840 --> 30:20.880
Now it's a crime to go to the pharmacy section.

30:20.880 --> 30:24.880
And get some old spice pure sport.

30:24.880 --> 30:25.760
Rub that in there.

30:25.760 --> 30:27.760
And then you come back to the jacket section.

30:27.760 --> 30:29.840
And the store clerk's like, what are you doing?

30:29.840 --> 30:31.760
Oh, nice.

30:31.760 --> 30:33.600
No BO, dude.

30:33.600 --> 30:35.520
Take it for a spin, baby.

30:35.520 --> 30:38.880
And then you climb into a tent.

30:38.880 --> 30:40.640
And you spend the night in Target.

30:40.640 --> 30:41.360
Okay, Travis.

30:43.120 --> 30:44.080
I was about to go to the money zone.

30:44.080 --> 30:45.040
I'm not going to let this go.

30:45.040 --> 30:46.480
I want to get some quick hits from you.

30:46.480 --> 30:46.960
Okay.

30:46.960 --> 30:48.800
I want to walk through Target with you virtually.

30:48.800 --> 30:49.040
Okay.

30:49.040 --> 30:51.040
And are you seriously saying that you-

30:51.040 --> 30:52.720
Whoa, it's like I'm there.

30:52.720 --> 30:53.040
I know.

30:53.040 --> 30:56.960
Are you seriously saying that it's not a problem, this coat action?

30:56.960 --> 31:02.000
You would not have a problem with you yourself believing yourself doing this.

31:03.840 --> 31:04.240
Oh, what?

31:04.240 --> 31:05.360
Wearing the coat?

31:05.360 --> 31:05.840
Yeah.

31:05.840 --> 31:07.200
Well, here's the thing, Justin.

31:07.200 --> 31:07.760
Uh-uh.

31:07.760 --> 31:08.480
No.

31:08.480 --> 31:09.440
Stop it.

31:09.440 --> 31:11.440
If I'm cold, would I put on the coat?

31:11.440 --> 31:11.920
Yes.

31:11.920 --> 31:12.420
Yeah.

31:15.440 --> 31:16.720
If I was going to buy it, yeah.

31:17.360 --> 31:17.680
Okay.

31:17.680 --> 31:20.160
That's absolutely not germane to this question.

31:20.160 --> 31:24.640
But that's not saying, Justin, there are many things that I'm not comfortable with myself.

31:24.640 --> 31:25.680
But that's what we're discussing.

31:25.680 --> 31:27.200
That doesn't make them crimes.

31:27.840 --> 31:30.800
You're saying that someone walking up to a table in a restaurant

31:30.800 --> 31:33.120
and playing live music in my face should be illegal

31:33.120 --> 31:34.400
because I'm not comfortable with it.

31:34.400 --> 31:34.960
I missed it.

31:34.960 --> 31:35.840
I missed it.

31:35.840 --> 31:37.440
Are they buying the jacket or not?

31:38.160 --> 31:39.840
They're just using it while they're in the store.

31:39.840 --> 31:41.680
Without the intent of purchasing it.

31:41.680 --> 31:42.640
Oh, well, then no.

31:43.200 --> 31:46.640
Then fucking, oh, I switched it and flip it.

31:46.640 --> 31:46.880
No.

31:47.680 --> 31:51.200
Obviously, I feel like I've been whistling dog songs here.

31:51.200 --> 31:51.760
Come on.

31:51.760 --> 31:58.000
I've just, I've been trying to free myself from my own preconceived notions

31:58.000 --> 32:01.200
and misconceptions to say, what difference does it make

32:01.200 --> 32:03.280
if you're cold and you put on the jacket and you put it back?

32:03.280 --> 32:05.760
It is obviously wrong and illegal.

32:05.760 --> 32:08.000
But the difference is not that we're not talking about legality.

32:08.000 --> 32:09.200
We're talking about mores.

32:09.200 --> 32:13.680
And it's the only thing that's holding us together as a people at this point.

32:13.680 --> 32:15.600
Honestly, everything else has failed us.

32:15.600 --> 32:18.320
We have to be able to agree on some things.

32:18.960 --> 32:24.640
If this show has a theme, you know, if this show is about something,

32:24.640 --> 32:28.320
it's about the fact that there have to be things we can agree on, okay?

32:28.960 --> 32:30.400
Just as a society.

32:30.400 --> 32:31.360
This isn't okay.

32:32.160 --> 32:32.800
Come on.

32:32.800 --> 32:33.520
You know what?

32:33.520 --> 32:34.240
It's not okay.

32:34.880 --> 32:36.480
That's what your mom should have said.

32:36.480 --> 32:39.200
Your mom should have let go of those first three arguments

32:39.200 --> 32:42.640
and then just looked at you and said, you know this isn't okay.

32:42.640 --> 32:43.680
You know it's not okay.

32:43.680 --> 32:48.080
I mean, I'm coming back to the other side though.

32:48.080 --> 32:48.800
Fuck!

32:48.800 --> 32:50.640
No, but listen, but listen, listen, listen.

32:51.440 --> 32:51.680
Okay.

32:52.240 --> 32:53.280
Target's gonna be fine.

32:53.280 --> 32:59.120
And I know that Target isn't like, you know, I'll wear a Hobby Lobby jacket

32:59.120 --> 33:03.680
and get my fucking reek all over that and put it right back on the shelf.

33:03.680 --> 33:07.360
I'll dump it in the potty and then I'll put it back on the shelf.

33:09.360 --> 33:11.280
Because I'm fucking, I'm a rude dude.

33:12.000 --> 33:17.280
Yeah, but Target, it wouldn't be mean to Target.

33:18.000 --> 33:19.680
I have no emotions to Target.

33:19.680 --> 33:21.520
I just have the emotion of cold.

33:21.520 --> 33:23.600
And so I would wear it and I would steal it.

33:23.600 --> 33:26.800
I would watch a little bit of Mr. Deeds and then I would put it back

33:26.800 --> 33:31.360
and I would tell somebody that I did this bad thing

33:31.360 --> 33:32.720
but they can't really do much about it.

33:32.720 --> 33:35.120
And then I would leave and guess what?

33:35.120 --> 33:36.400
Target's gonna be just fine.

33:37.760 --> 33:38.640
Target's gonna be fine.

33:40.000 --> 33:43.920
The question is not, does it have ramifications?

33:43.920 --> 33:48.560
The question is not, what are the long-term effects of doing it, Griffin?

33:48.560 --> 33:50.080
Of course, Target's gonna be fine.

33:50.080 --> 33:52.080
You wore a jacket for 10 minutes.

33:52.080 --> 33:53.680
Of course, they're gonna be fine.

33:53.680 --> 33:56.880
The question, here's what the real question should be.

33:56.880 --> 33:59.440
Not is it evil or good or anything like that?

33:59.440 --> 34:05.680
But can we all agree that there's an invisible boundary saying not to do it?

34:05.680 --> 34:11.760
Much like if you walked past a party that was having a buffet,

34:11.760 --> 34:14.640
of course there's nothing wrong walking in and going and eating a piece,

34:14.640 --> 34:15.680
like a sandwich and leaving.

34:16.400 --> 34:18.160
You wouldn't be arrested for that.

34:18.160 --> 34:20.240
But we all know you should not do that

34:20.240 --> 34:21.760
because you weren't invited to the party.

34:21.760 --> 34:24.320
Yeah, but it's kind of fucking punk rock to wear this jacket.

34:24.320 --> 34:26.080
I'm coming around hard.

34:26.080 --> 34:28.320
I'm like way on the other side now.

34:28.320 --> 34:28.880
Wear a jacket.

34:28.880 --> 34:30.080
So it's a protest wear.

34:30.080 --> 34:32.880
Throw on some fucking board shorts while you're at it

34:32.880 --> 34:34.080
and give those a spin.

34:34.080 --> 34:34.480
Maybe toss on some-

34:34.480 --> 34:36.400
No, nothing below the belt.

34:36.400 --> 34:36.800
Come on, Griffin.

34:36.800 --> 34:38.480
Nothing below the belt.

34:38.480 --> 34:40.080
I mean, over your pants.

34:40.080 --> 34:40.720
Oh, okay.

34:40.720 --> 34:41.200
That's fine.

34:41.920 --> 34:42.480
That's a good look.

34:42.480 --> 34:45.920
Y'all remember that look where we'd wear sort of shorts over sweatpants

34:45.920 --> 34:47.440
and people would look at us and be like,

34:47.440 --> 34:50.080
that's a guy going to play basketball later and it's like, no.

34:50.080 --> 34:52.640
I do, also, as long as we're talking about looks that we miss,

34:52.640 --> 34:55.200
I miss the Gutenberg crop top sweatshirt.

34:55.200 --> 34:56.320
Oh, God.

34:56.320 --> 34:57.440
Man, can we bring that back?

34:58.080 --> 34:59.680
I used to do a reverse look

34:59.680 --> 35:01.680
where I would wear gym shorts under sweatpants

35:01.680 --> 35:03.040
so I wouldn't have to change for gym.

35:03.040 --> 35:04.640
Oh, we all did that.

35:04.640 --> 35:05.520
Okay, good.

35:05.520 --> 35:07.680
That's why I took individual dual sports

35:07.680 --> 35:09.760
so I wouldn't work up that reek.

35:09.760 --> 35:12.400
I would do like an evil Steve Gutenberg crop top

35:12.400 --> 35:13.920
where it just covered my belly,

35:13.920 --> 35:17.600
but like my chest and shoulders were fully exposed.

35:18.400 --> 35:18.720
How?

35:18.720 --> 35:21.920
It just, it was more or less just a big shirt belt

35:21.920 --> 35:23.600
that wrapped around my belly,

35:24.160 --> 35:30.640
but then you could see like my nipples and armpits and everything.

35:30.640 --> 35:31.120
Oh.

35:32.720 --> 35:33.920
And people liked that.

35:33.920 --> 35:35.120
People liked that about me.

35:35.120 --> 35:35.600
They did.

35:37.360 --> 35:37.920
They did.

35:37.920 --> 35:38.400
They did.

35:38.400 --> 35:39.440
You know what I like about you?

35:39.440 --> 35:40.000
What, Justin?

35:40.720 --> 35:43.120
You're good at reading ad copy.

35:43.120 --> 35:45.120
That's categorically not true.

35:45.680 --> 35:48.320
Let's prove it and head on over to the blog.

35:48.320 --> 36:00.080
Let's head over to the Money Center.

36:00.080 --> 36:02.880
Thank God for the US Postal Service.

36:04.000 --> 36:05.040
They're keeping everything,

36:05.040 --> 36:06.480
trying to keep everything together.

36:06.480 --> 36:09.120
It's tough to go to the post office though physically,

36:09.120 --> 36:12.400
not only with like the, you know, the stuff going around.

36:12.960 --> 36:14.480
Some of the unpleasantness happening,

36:14.480 --> 36:15.920
but also, you know, you get busy.

36:15.920 --> 36:16.720
It's crowded.

36:16.720 --> 36:18.640
Yep.

36:18.640 --> 36:19.840
I love to get busy.

36:21.040 --> 36:23.920
Time to get busy over at Stamps.com.

36:23.920 --> 36:27.120
Mailing is going to be super popular here in the holiday season,

36:27.120 --> 36:29.760
and you can stay ahead of all the crowds.

36:29.760 --> 36:33.280
Just use your computer to print official US postage 24-7

36:33.280 --> 36:37.200
for any letter, any package, any class of mail,

36:37.200 --> 36:38.800
anywhere you want to send it.

36:38.800 --> 36:40.080
Once your mail is ready,

36:40.080 --> 36:42.240
you schedule a pickup or drop it off.

36:42.240 --> 36:43.520
It's that simple.

36:43.520 --> 36:46.720
You'll save some cash on your shipping,

36:46.720 --> 36:50.960
and it's just a great way to utilize this great institution.

36:51.600 --> 36:53.200
So don't spend a minute of your holiday season

36:53.200 --> 36:54.480
at the post office this year.

36:54.480 --> 36:56.080
Sign up for Stamps.com.

36:56.080 --> 36:59.600
Instead, there's no risk with my promo code, MyBrother.

36:59.600 --> 37:00.000
That's right.

37:00.000 --> 37:01.600
I said my promo code, MyBrother.

37:01.600 --> 37:02.560
Oh!

37:02.560 --> 37:03.280
Private one.

37:03.840 --> 37:06.960
You get a special offer that includes a four-week trial

37:06.960 --> 37:08.960
plus free postage in a digital scale.

37:08.960 --> 37:10.720
No long-term commitments or contracts.

37:10.720 --> 37:11.840
Just go to Stamps.com.

37:11.840 --> 37:13.440
Click on the microphone at the top of the homepage,

37:13.440 --> 37:15.120
and enter MyBrother.

37:15.120 --> 37:16.080
That's Stamps.com.

37:16.080 --> 37:17.760
Enter MyBrother.

37:17.760 --> 37:18.560
Stamps.com?

37:19.600 --> 37:21.120
Never go to the post office again.

37:21.680 --> 37:22.880
Wish you guys hate more.

37:22.880 --> 37:24.960
Enter MyBrother or slash MyBrother.

37:24.960 --> 37:25.520
They're both the words to say, right?

37:25.520 --> 37:28.720
I think I hate Enter MyBrother more.

37:28.720 --> 37:30.720
Enter MyBrother is so bad to say.

37:30.720 --> 37:33.120
Slash MyBrother at least sounds like maybe

37:33.120 --> 37:34.320
MyBrother could fight back.

37:34.960 --> 37:35.280
Yeah.

37:35.920 --> 37:36.240
Yeah.

37:37.120 --> 37:38.000
I guess it's true.

37:39.040 --> 37:40.000
You guys naked or what?

37:40.000 --> 37:43.840
Hawthorne's next up on the chopping block.

37:43.840 --> 37:45.360
It's actually not next up, Griffin.

37:45.360 --> 37:46.400
Next up was Stitch Fix.

37:46.400 --> 37:47.920
And if you say Hawthorne is next up,

37:47.920 --> 37:49.040
it makes Justin saying,

37:49.040 --> 37:51.280
are you guys naked really weird?

37:51.280 --> 37:53.040
And it was already really weird,

37:53.040 --> 37:54.080
but saying like,

37:54.080 --> 37:55.440
yeah, Justin said we're naked.

37:55.440 --> 37:58.320
Anyways, here's a premium tailored personal care for you.

37:58.320 --> 38:00.080
Do you guys have your dicks out?

38:00.640 --> 38:02.880
Because I want to talk about toothbrushes.

38:06.560 --> 38:07.120
All right.

38:07.120 --> 38:08.880
Well, I guess Travis do the other.

38:08.880 --> 38:11.120
Okay, so Stitch Fix.

38:11.120 --> 38:11.440
Yeah.

38:11.440 --> 38:13.520
Listen, look down at your shirt.

38:13.520 --> 38:15.040
That's a dumb shirt.

38:15.040 --> 38:16.640
Unless you got it from Stitch Fix.

38:17.680 --> 38:18.640
Then it's good.

38:18.640 --> 38:19.920
Then it's a good shirt.

38:21.440 --> 38:22.240
Yeah.

38:22.240 --> 38:23.840
So look at those pants.

38:23.840 --> 38:24.560
They're okay.

38:24.560 --> 38:26.080
But are they Stitch Fix pants?

38:26.080 --> 38:28.080
If they are, nice.

38:28.080 --> 38:31.200
Stitch Fix offers clothing hand selected by expert stylist

38:31.200 --> 38:33.360
for your unique size, style, and budget.

38:33.360 --> 38:35.280
That budget one is one of my favorites

38:35.280 --> 38:36.480
because you can go there and be like,

38:36.480 --> 38:40.240
hey, I would never pay more than like blank for a t-shirt.

38:40.240 --> 38:42.480
And they're like, yeah, you got it, dude.

38:42.480 --> 38:45.200
Here's a cool t-shirt for the price you set.

38:45.200 --> 38:47.600
And you can try those pieces on at home before you buy.

38:47.600 --> 38:49.440
Keep your favorites, send the rest back.

38:49.440 --> 38:51.120
So if you get some cool Stitch Fix pants

38:51.120 --> 38:53.520
and you're like, these Stitch Fix pants are too cool for me.

38:53.520 --> 38:56.160

39:00.240 --> 39:02.000
and there's no subscription required.

39:02.000 --> 39:02.960
I love Stitch Fix.

39:02.960 --> 39:06.640
I am wearing Stitch Fix right now pretty much all the time

39:06.640 --> 39:07.360
at this point.

39:08.160 --> 39:10.880
It's nice to have grownups that dress me

39:10.880 --> 39:12.640
and give me good clothes to wear

39:12.640 --> 39:15.840

Do you guys have combo home and car insurance?

39:46.720 --> 39:48.560
So today I'm gonna talk about Hawthorne.

39:48.560 --> 39:49.840
They make bathroom stuff.

39:50.880 --> 39:51.920
They make bathroom stuff

39:51.920 --> 39:54.560
that's gonna give you a right pretty stink.

39:54.560 --> 39:57.520
And it's all kinds of stuff.

39:57.520 --> 39:59.440
Anything that you have in your bathroom,

39:59.440 --> 40:00.800
look around your bathroom right now.

40:00.800 --> 40:01.760
Everybody, give me a second.

40:04.400 --> 40:06.160
Oh, mm, nice.

40:06.160 --> 40:08.880
Do you have any Hawthorne stuff in there, Trev?

40:08.880 --> 40:11.120
I got this good smelling Hawthorne stuff.

40:11.120 --> 40:12.080
Okay, everything else.

40:12.080 --> 40:13.120
Spray it into my mouth.

40:14.240 --> 40:16.960
No, do not consume Hawthorne.

40:16.960 --> 40:18.560
We've been clear about this from the beginning.

40:18.560 --> 40:21.120
You know, I was actually a Hawthorne subscriber

40:21.120 --> 40:23.360
before they decided to advertise with this.

40:24.080 --> 40:24.800
I was into it.

40:24.800 --> 40:28.880
You answer some questions about your lifestyle,

40:28.880 --> 40:32.240
how you like to live your days here on Earth.

40:32.240 --> 40:33.200
Live moss.

40:33.200 --> 40:34.000
Live moss.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.480
And they're gonna give you a delicious batch

40:36.480 --> 40:40.240
of different bathroom essentials

40:40.240 --> 40:43.680
that's gonna match your whole vibe.

40:43.680 --> 40:44.320
And if you don't-

40:44.320 --> 40:46.160
If you don't like, go ahead.

40:46.160 --> 40:46.960
You say it.

40:46.960 --> 40:47.760
And if you don't like-

40:47.760 --> 40:48.800
If you don't like your-

40:48.800 --> 40:50.080
And if you don't like them-

40:50.080 --> 40:50.880
Say it together.

40:50.880 --> 40:52.160

41:21.120 --> 41:21.760
Mybrother.

41:23.200 --> 41:25.120
I don't think we actually are doing that one anymore.

41:25.120 --> 41:26.800
Yeah, we stopped doing that one.

41:26.800 --> 41:29.360
Listen, I'm a hotshot Hollywood movie producer.

41:29.360 --> 41:31.440
You have until I finish my glass of kombucha

41:31.440 --> 41:32.640
to pitch me your idea.

41:32.640 --> 41:32.880
Go.

41:33.440 --> 41:33.760
All right.

41:33.760 --> 41:35.200
It's called Who Shot Ya?

41:35.200 --> 41:38.400
A movie podcast that isn't just a bunch of straight white dudes.

41:38.400 --> 41:40.480
I'm Ify Whiteyway, the new host of the show

41:40.480 --> 41:41.920
and a certified BBN.

41:41.920 --> 41:42.720
BBN?

41:42.720 --> 41:43.680
Buff black nerd.

41:43.680 --> 41:46.560
I'm Alonzo Duraldi, an elderly gay and legit film critic

41:46.560 --> 41:48.400
who wrote a book on Christmas movies.

41:48.400 --> 41:51.760
I'm Drea Clark, a loud white lady from Minnesota.

41:51.760 --> 41:54.320
Each week, we talk about a new movie in theaters

41:54.320 --> 41:56.960
and all the important issues going on in the film industry.

41:56.960 --> 41:59.280
It's like Guess Who's Coming to Dinner meets Cruising.

41:59.280 --> 42:01.920
And if it helps seal the deal, I can flex my muscles

42:01.920 --> 42:03.360
while we record each episode.

42:03.360 --> 42:05.440
I'm sorry, this is a podcast?

42:05.440 --> 42:06.480
I'm a movie producer.

42:06.480 --> 42:07.600
How did you get in here?

42:07.600 --> 42:09.440
Ify, quick, start flexing.

42:09.440 --> 42:11.520
Bicep, lats, chest.

42:12.240 --> 42:12.960
Who Shot Ya?

42:12.960 --> 42:15.200
Dropping every Friday on maximumfun.org

42:15.200 --> 42:30.560
or wherever you listen to podcasts.

42:30.560 --> 42:33.280
I have never been so certain about the product

42:33.280 --> 42:34.880
that you're going to talk about today

42:34.880 --> 42:36.480
as I am right now.

42:36.480 --> 42:37.520
You have no idea.

42:37.520 --> 42:37.840
Okay.

42:38.400 --> 42:40.160
Fatburger has introduced a product

42:40.160 --> 42:43.920
and I'm wild about this late-breaking story.

42:43.920 --> 42:45.040
This is Munch Squad, by the way.

42:45.040 --> 42:46.640
It's a podcast within a podcast.

42:46.640 --> 42:47.120
Profiling-

42:47.120 --> 42:48.000
In it's twilight.

42:48.560 --> 42:49.280
Brand eating.

42:49.280 --> 42:50.240
It is in its twilight.

42:50.240 --> 42:50.880
Thank you, Travis.

42:50.880 --> 42:51.600
It's winding down.

42:51.600 --> 42:52.240
It's on its final-

42:52.240 --> 42:53.520
Now, some people might point out

42:53.520 --> 42:55.680
that there's been a Munch Squad in every episode

42:55.680 --> 42:57.600
for the last 60 episodes.

42:57.600 --> 42:58.560
Not actually accurate.

42:58.560 --> 43:02.000
But that is just because this is the dying gasps,

43:02.000 --> 43:02.880
the death rattle.

43:04.560 --> 43:06.000
I'm going to start with a junior

43:06.000 --> 43:07.840
because my real Munch Squad is not.

43:08.560 --> 43:10.880
I got a junior, then a junior junior,

43:11.680 --> 43:13.680
and then a full Munch Squad.

43:13.680 --> 43:15.520
Can we call the junior junior a kid's meal?

43:16.080 --> 43:17.680
Yeah, I got a kid's meal, a junior,

43:17.680 --> 43:19.920
and a full adult.

43:19.920 --> 43:20.880
And a big stinky.

43:21.840 --> 43:23.440
Let me just get through this, okay?

43:23.440 --> 43:23.680
Okay.

43:24.400 --> 43:25.040
In a year with-

43:25.680 --> 43:26.880
Fatburger introduces-

43:27.760 --> 43:28.960
Well, I'll save the name.

43:28.960 --> 43:30.640
In a year with unprecedented challenges-

43:30.640 --> 43:31.040
Oh, boy.

43:31.600 --> 43:34.320
There are only several more weeks to hang in there.

43:35.040 --> 43:38.640
Hollywood favorite Fatburger wants to help customers

43:38.640 --> 43:41.600
do just that until we ring in a fresh new year.

43:41.600 --> 43:43.840
To help get through the remainder of 2020,

43:43.840 --> 43:46.000
Fatburger, known for its delicious

43:46.000 --> 43:47.200
grilled to perfection burgers,

43:47.840 --> 43:50.080
is launching a limited time menu item,

43:50.880 --> 43:52.160
the Hang In There Burger.

43:52.160 --> 43:52.800
Oh, boy.

43:55.200 --> 43:55.760
Oh, boy.

43:57.440 --> 44:00.640
The Hang In There Burger is everyone's favorite OG Fatburger

44:00.640 --> 44:03.920
with all the fixings,

44:04.480 --> 44:09.520
including chili, onion rings, American cheese, bacon, egg,

44:09.520 --> 44:14.400
and topped off with, and this isn't quote, the works.

44:15.120 --> 44:17.440
Wait, if the works don't include those things

44:17.440 --> 44:19.760
you said before, what the fuck are the works?

44:19.760 --> 44:21.600
Eh, questione.

44:21.600 --> 44:22.400
Maybe it's love.

44:23.360 --> 44:25.120
Hey, I got no idea.

44:25.120 --> 44:29.520
Quote, this year certainly has been challenging for everyone,

44:29.520 --> 44:32.000
says Andy Weiderhorn, CEO of Fat Brands.

44:32.960 --> 44:36.160
Everyone, fulfilling his legal obligation

44:36.160 --> 44:38.160
to mention that there is a global pandemic

44:38.160 --> 44:40.640
with the year almost coming to a close,

44:40.640 --> 44:43.680
we wanted to create a burger that encourages our loyal fans

44:43.680 --> 44:47.200
to simply hang in there, put a smile on their faces,

44:47.200 --> 44:50.240
and remind them that together we will get through this.

44:50.720 --> 44:54.320
I like that Fatburger has accepted that no one is thriving

44:54.320 --> 44:57.920
and the best that we can all hope for is to merely exist.

44:57.920 --> 45:01.360
Just eat this huge, ridiculous burger and get through it.

45:01.360 --> 45:04.400
Oh, thank you for having me.

45:04.400 --> 45:08.320
Loving me, it's me, Donut Dracula.

45:08.320 --> 45:11.440
Did Count Donut just climb out of Justin's throat?

45:11.440 --> 45:16.080
Count Donut is here, not Donut Dracula, that's my dad.

45:16.080 --> 45:16.580
Please.

45:17.680 --> 45:18.960
I'm Count Donut.

45:20.080 --> 45:24.320
I've got a great new story about a delectable delight.

45:24.320 --> 45:25.360
Is it about a donut?

45:25.920 --> 45:29.200
Yes, Travis, it's about a donut.

45:29.200 --> 45:30.560
Why else would I be here?

45:30.560 --> 45:31.920
I don't know, Count Donut.

45:31.920 --> 45:37.840
Marks and Spencer is a UK brand and they have a new very fun donut.

45:37.840 --> 45:43.760
It's a yum yum donut hybrid that have been given a Christmassy makeover

45:43.760 --> 45:50.000
with delicious flaky pastry layers and a sweet center's belt topping.

45:50.000 --> 45:53.360
Now, if I could describe this, imagine a toasty flaky donut.

45:53.360 --> 45:54.480
Oh, I'm making myself.

45:55.280 --> 45:56.000
That's blood.

45:56.960 --> 46:00.480
And then on top, there is a red frosting

46:00.480 --> 46:06.000
and then there's a adorable brown belt with a gold buckle on it

46:06.000 --> 46:09.600
and it looks just like Santa's tummy and it's so precious

46:09.600 --> 46:12.080
and it's called Santa's Yum Nut.

46:12.960 --> 46:18.800
Yes, the tweet says, who wants a bite of Santa's Yum Nut?

46:18.800 --> 46:20.480
Hey, Gary, you're fired.

46:21.280 --> 46:22.800
You're fired, Gary.

46:24.160 --> 46:25.760
I wanted to remember the name of this

46:25.760 --> 46:28.320
because I saw a lot of people talking about Yum Nuts.

46:28.320 --> 46:32.080
There was a headline that some news outlet wrote that was like,

46:32.080 --> 46:35.200
M&S make an accidental emu window

46:35.200 --> 46:38.560
and everyone's making fun of them on social media now.

46:38.560 --> 46:42.160
I don't know how you could possibly accidentally-

46:42.160 --> 46:43.840
It's called Santa's Yum Nut.

46:43.840 --> 46:46.160
The tweet is, who wants a bite of Santa's Yum Nut?

46:46.160 --> 46:47.920
We all know what's going on here.

46:47.920 --> 46:51.920
It's time to talk about the real story and we've all been waiting for it.

46:51.920 --> 46:54.880
It's always a hot topic here on this program.

46:54.880 --> 47:00.080
Starbucks holiday lineup and peppermint mocha arrive November 6th.

47:00.080 --> 47:04.240
As we're recording this, that is today, I'm seeing the cup.

47:04.240 --> 47:06.720
Does it just have like a big crucifix on it?

47:06.720 --> 47:08.800
Oh, let me know about it, Juice.

47:08.800 --> 47:10.800
All right, buddy, hang in there.

47:10.800 --> 47:11.600
We're gonna get there.

47:11.600 --> 47:16.320
We got new, we got some holiday seasonal favorites.

47:16.320 --> 47:18.880
We got peppermint mocha, toasted white chocolate mocha,

47:18.880 --> 47:23.360
caramel brulee latte, chestnut praline latte, and eggnog latte.

47:23.360 --> 47:27.360
So that is amazing.

47:27.360 --> 47:28.960
I don't care about any of that shit.

47:28.960 --> 47:29.600
What's the cup?

47:30.240 --> 47:31.920
Okay, there's new, okay.

47:31.920 --> 47:37.120
This year's theme, carry the merry, is an invitation

47:37.120 --> 47:40.480
to enjoy the little moments of brightness around you.

47:40.480 --> 47:45.760
Hey, that better be M-A-R-Y merry, like the Virgin Mary.

47:45.760 --> 47:50.160
It better be carry a cup full of the Virgin Mary with you.

47:50.160 --> 47:53.760
Yeah, it was about people carrying them out into the world

47:53.760 --> 47:57.200
as quote, messengers of joy.

47:58.000 --> 48:01.200
That's how they think of someone who takes a Starbucks cup out of there,

48:01.200 --> 48:03.280
is to make a messenger of joy.

48:03.840 --> 48:07.040
That's Jeff Wilkinson, who is, I don't know how to tell you,

48:07.040 --> 48:08.240
creative director for Starbucks.

48:08.800 --> 48:12.640
In a way that message deepened as we got further and further into this year.

48:12.640 --> 48:13.360
Go on, Jeff.

48:13.360 --> 48:14.080
Fuck yeah.

48:14.080 --> 48:14.800
Do tell, bud.

48:14.800 --> 48:16.960
It's only getting better, Jeff says.

48:16.960 --> 48:20.480
Yes, we want that to be a beacon for people.

48:20.480 --> 48:22.640
A brief moment that they can look forward to.

48:22.640 --> 48:23.200
Oh boy.

48:23.200 --> 48:26.800
Does Jeff mean fucking seeing the cups?

48:26.800 --> 48:29.040
Jeff also means, if I'm interpreting this correctly,

48:29.040 --> 48:33.600
the worse it gets out here, you know, in life,

48:34.240 --> 48:36.240
the fucking doper these cups get.

48:38.400 --> 48:42.560
If a fucking volcano erupts in the middle of Austin

48:43.120 --> 48:45.920
and everyone gets covered in ash,

48:45.920 --> 48:48.000
but I walk out of the Starbucks with a cup,

48:48.000 --> 48:50.160
the employee's gonna be like, you brave missionary.

48:50.800 --> 48:51.680
Carrie the Mary.

48:52.960 --> 48:55.920
Carrie, it sucks so bad out there.

48:55.920 --> 48:57.680
People are looking to your cup.

48:57.680 --> 49:00.640
Hey Jeff, how about your message isn't like,

49:00.640 --> 49:02.320
hey everybody, go to Starbucks

49:02.320 --> 49:04.960
and then just walk around showing your cup to people.

49:04.960 --> 49:07.280
What if your message was stay fucking home?

49:08.000 --> 49:08.720
Stay home?

49:08.720 --> 49:10.880
Just stay at, that's our message.

49:10.880 --> 49:11.760
Stay at home.

49:11.760 --> 49:12.640
Stay the fuck home.

49:12.640 --> 49:16.640
How about bury the Mary in your backyard

49:16.640 --> 49:18.560
and then just go back to bed?

49:18.560 --> 49:22.880
If there is a sizable enough portion of the populace

49:22.880 --> 49:27.120
that needs the nasty burger and the fun cups

49:27.120 --> 49:29.600
to be able to quote, hang in there,

49:29.600 --> 49:32.720
the American experiment has failed.

49:32.720 --> 49:33.040
Yes.

49:33.040 --> 49:34.240
We are done.

49:34.240 --> 49:35.680
We can start over.

49:35.680 --> 49:37.680
The quicker we say we're done,

49:37.680 --> 49:40.720
the quicker we can start over and try something else.

49:40.720 --> 49:42.880
Hey, can I do a quick Yahoo?

49:42.880 --> 49:43.920
Cause I'm really curious about,

49:43.920 --> 49:46.480
I know you guys have a little bit of law experience

49:46.480 --> 49:48.320
and I was hoping you could bust me out some.

49:48.320 --> 49:49.360
I know it's after Halloween,

49:49.360 --> 49:50.880
so we're a little bit late on it.

49:50.880 --> 49:52.480
This one was sent in by Ben Cant.

49:52.480 --> 49:53.360
Thank you, Ben.

49:53.360 --> 49:56.400
It's Yahoo Answers user, Joe, who asks,

49:57.600 --> 50:00.000
is scaring people with a chainsaw legal?

50:00.720 --> 50:02.320
My brother and I have been scaring people

50:02.320 --> 50:03.760
five years with my chainsaw.

50:05.120 --> 50:06.400
And this year of Halloween,

50:06.400 --> 50:08.560
we got the cops called on us by a lady,

50:08.560 --> 50:09.920
but the cops never showed up.

50:09.920 --> 50:11.280
The cops never showed up.

50:11.280 --> 50:13.840
BTW, we were on our property scaring them

50:13.840 --> 50:15.200
and we never got too close to them

50:15.200 --> 50:16.480
and a lot of people like us

50:16.480 --> 50:19.360
and the chainsaw do its amazing sound.

50:19.360 --> 50:21.200
The chainsaw do its amazing sound.

50:21.200 --> 50:21.760
That is true.

50:21.760 --> 50:25.680
Hold on, I'm incapable of reading this.

50:26.560 --> 50:27.760
We never get close to them

50:27.760 --> 50:29.280
and a lot of people like us

50:29.280 --> 50:32.640
and the chainsaw due to its amazing sound.

50:32.640 --> 50:33.600
Oh, D-O-2.

50:33.600 --> 50:34.800
Okay, I see what they've done here.

50:35.440 --> 50:36.880
Updated three days ago is scaring people

50:36.880 --> 50:38.720
with a chainsaw on Halloween legal.

50:38.720 --> 50:40.400
So they wanted to really make sure that you-

50:40.400 --> 50:41.920
Oh, on Halloween?

50:41.920 --> 50:43.600
A little TLDR, yeah.

50:43.600 --> 50:46.320
I would argue that that detail is important

50:46.320 --> 50:48.480
because if it's like June 9th

50:49.360 --> 50:51.280
and you run at someone with a chainsaw,

50:52.320 --> 50:53.600
you're going to jail.

50:53.600 --> 50:54.640
I remember there was a,

50:55.520 --> 50:57.200
what was it, Trail of Terror?

50:58.960 --> 50:59.680
What was it called?

50:59.680 --> 51:01.360
There was a thing in Huntington

51:01.360 --> 51:04.160
that was haunted trail and you would go down it

51:04.160 --> 51:06.640
and there would be spooky events

51:06.640 --> 51:07.840
that would occur

51:07.840 --> 51:09.440
and sometimes one of them I remember

51:09.440 --> 51:10.800
was like it looked like headlights

51:10.800 --> 51:12.640
were coming at you through some trees

51:12.640 --> 51:13.680
and it's like, uh-oh,

51:13.680 --> 51:18.000
and there would be a couple mummies or whatever.

51:18.000 --> 51:18.960
But then at one part,

51:20.560 --> 51:22.080
a guy with a chainsaw

51:22.640 --> 51:25.200
would jump out of some corn.

51:25.920 --> 51:26.960
That was the grand finale.

51:26.960 --> 51:29.120
Yeah, he would chase you down the hill.

51:29.120 --> 51:30.160
And I remember thinking like,

51:31.280 --> 51:32.400
that's an escalation.

51:33.760 --> 51:35.200
Like you had a couple mummies back there

51:35.200 --> 51:37.840
and you had like a, oh, ghostly bride.

51:37.840 --> 51:38.720
But I'm a kid

51:39.520 --> 51:41.680
and you can't jump out at me with a chainsaw.

51:41.680 --> 51:44.240
And this is a hill in the woods

51:44.240 --> 51:45.600
in the middle of the night.

51:46.960 --> 51:48.640
Apparently there was no chain on it.

51:48.640 --> 51:50.800
It just due to its amazing sound.

51:51.520 --> 51:53.200
But I didn't know that.

51:54.320 --> 51:55.920
I remember thinking every time I did it,

51:55.920 --> 51:58.720
like, why am I going down this trail?

51:58.720 --> 51:59.840
Because I know death is,

51:59.840 --> 52:02.480
I know the specter of death is waiting for me at the end.

52:02.480 --> 52:06.160
And you wait such a long time.

52:06.160 --> 52:08.240
Just like pretty much every haunted house I've ever been to.

52:08.240 --> 52:09.600
And the whole time you're in line,

52:09.600 --> 52:10.420
you just hear like,

52:10.420 --> 52:12.960
vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom,

52:12.960 --> 52:14.640
and you're like, oh yeah, you know it's coming.

52:14.640 --> 52:15.440
Get to that.

52:16.960 --> 52:18.560
Maybe it would be better

52:18.560 --> 52:20.560
if before you scared people with a chainsaw,

52:20.560 --> 52:23.120
you yelled, there's no chain on it.

52:23.120 --> 52:25.920
Vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom.

52:25.920 --> 52:28.880
That way you're still making its amazing sound.

52:29.440 --> 52:30.880
Yeah, that's good.

52:30.880 --> 52:33.440
So you can put up a sign in your front yard that says like,

52:33.440 --> 52:35.040
hey, you're about to be scared

52:35.680 --> 52:38.000
by a big gentleman with a chainsaw,

52:38.000 --> 52:40.560
but don't sweat it because there's no chain on it

52:40.560 --> 52:42.080
and he's not really going to hurt you.

52:42.640 --> 52:43.680
And then just for good measure,

52:43.680 --> 52:46.560
he steps outside and says, get ready to be scared.

52:46.560 --> 52:47.840
I'll be out in five.

52:51.280 --> 52:51.760
Oh no.

52:51.760 --> 52:52.880
But would you let him fly?

52:54.240 --> 52:54.740
Sorry?

52:56.240 --> 52:58.000
Would you let him fly with a chainsaw?

52:58.000 --> 52:58.800
Wasn't that the question?

52:58.800 --> 53:01.280
Would you let him fly in an airplane?

53:01.280 --> 53:01.920
Just, wait.

53:01.920 --> 53:03.360
Justin, there's no way that,

53:03.360 --> 53:05.120
there's no way you got there, right?

53:05.120 --> 53:08.240
If you got there for real and this isn't a goof.

53:09.840 --> 53:11.200
I thought the question was,

53:13.040 --> 53:15.920
are you allowed to fly on an airplane with a chainsaw?

53:15.920 --> 53:18.880
You did not think that.

53:18.880 --> 53:19.840
At no point, at no point,

53:20.480 --> 53:24.320
the transportation of this log cutting instrument

53:25.680 --> 53:26.720
come up in the question.

53:26.720 --> 53:27.440
Justin.

53:27.440 --> 53:27.920
Justin.

53:27.920 --> 53:29.440
I'm pretty sure the question was,

53:29.440 --> 53:30.880
are you allowed to fly in an airplane?

53:30.880 --> 53:31.600
That was not.

53:32.960 --> 53:36.000
I've gotten like six hours of sleep this week.

53:36.000 --> 53:36.720
Like I get it.

53:36.720 --> 53:40.560
We're all fucking tuned in, jacked in,

53:40.560 --> 53:42.320
fucking plugged in, getting that drip,

53:42.320 --> 53:44.560
getting that slow Pennsylvania drip.

53:44.560 --> 53:45.920
But my man.

53:46.560 --> 53:48.640
Those words were not incorporated,

53:48.640 --> 53:50.240
not only not in the question,

53:50.240 --> 53:52.560
but Griffin and I did not say them.

53:52.560 --> 53:53.600
Words not said.

53:53.600 --> 53:54.880
Why don't we read it again?

53:54.880 --> 53:56.560
Let's phonetically, let's read it again.

53:56.560 --> 53:58.240
Okay, let's see if Justin,

53:58.240 --> 54:00.080
we can find where Justin went wrong.

54:00.080 --> 54:02.400
My brother and I have been airport pilot,

54:02.400 --> 54:06.080
plane airport side clouds for five years.

54:06.080 --> 54:07.120
Oh, I miss it.

54:08.080 --> 54:09.920
I got so excited for a second.

54:09.920 --> 54:11.760
I thought vindication was on the horizon.

54:11.760 --> 54:13.840
No, sorry, it says scare port.

54:13.840 --> 54:14.400
Oh, no.

54:15.280 --> 54:17.360
Isn't every airport a scare port?

54:17.360 --> 54:20.320
Now, if you think about it.

54:21.760 --> 54:24.240
Get to the pain, we're ready to die.

54:24.240 --> 54:28.400
It's the best game.

54:28.400 --> 54:30.000
This has been my brother and my brother and me.

54:30.000 --> 54:31.440
Thanks for hanging in there with us.

54:31.440 --> 54:32.800
We hope you're doing okay.

54:32.800 --> 54:36.000
You hope we don't need a burger to keep it going.

54:36.000 --> 54:37.920
We hope we can be that nasty burger.

54:37.920 --> 54:42.000
Hey, let us be your nasty burger and your cup.

54:42.000 --> 54:44.960
We'll be your cup and your nasty burger.

54:44.960 --> 54:47.360
If you do need something though, McElroyMerch.com

54:48.560 --> 54:50.080

54:50.080 --> 54:52.000

54:52.000 --> 54:56.080
help you ward off the seasonal affective disorder.

54:56.080 --> 54:56.880
Like what, Justin?

54:57.520 --> 54:59.840
Well, bud, whatever you want.

54:59.840 --> 55:01.760
Do you want a void fish pin?

55:01.760 --> 55:03.600
You want a vaccines bumper sticker?

55:04.160 --> 55:07.760
You want a horseshoe crab t-shirt from Sawbones?

55:07.760 --> 55:10.800
You want any kind of Sawbones merchandise you get

55:10.800 --> 55:12.800
and that I don't have to split the profits of that

55:12.800 --> 55:15.040
with my brothers is the way you want to go.

55:16.400 --> 55:18.160
We're bearing the lead here a little bit

55:18.160 --> 55:21.280
because coming up on November 21st,

55:21.280 --> 55:24.080
we're doing a My Brother, My Brother and Me live show.

55:24.080 --> 55:24.640

Holy crap.

55:25.200 --> 55:26.160
It's virtual.

55:26.960 --> 55:31.200
It's a virtual live show with Sawbones opening.

55:31.200 --> 55:33.280
It's our first ever virtual live show.

55:33.280 --> 55:34.560
What's it gonna be like?

55:34.560 --> 55:35.120
We don't fucking know.

55:35.120 --> 55:36.320
We have no idea.

55:37.520 --> 55:38.400
I know what it's gonna be like.

55:38.400 --> 55:40.000
It's gonna be a lot of fun for everyone.

55:40.000 --> 55:40.320
Okay.

55:40.320 --> 55:41.120

Virtually.

Every city.

55:57.680 --> 55:58.560
All cities.

The last episode, they talked about the new consoles coming out.

57:00.400 --> 57:03.600
Well, I guess that was the one before last because we're recording.

57:03.600 --> 57:04.880
It's not important.

57:04.880 --> 57:06.240
It's very informative.

57:06.240 --> 57:09.520
You're gonna hear a lot in the upcoming months about these consoles.

57:09.520 --> 57:11.200
You're gonna be confused about it.

57:11.200 --> 57:15.200
So why don't you let your best friends tell you what the bullshit is

57:15.200 --> 57:16.720
and what the real shit is.

57:16.720 --> 57:18.000
Cut through the bullshit.

57:18.000 --> 57:19.680
That's the signature sign off for that.

57:19.680 --> 57:22.720
The Besties, it's available exclusively on Spotify.

57:22.720 --> 57:24.880
Go subscribe down, tell all your friends.

57:24.880 --> 57:27.040
Thanks to John Roderick and the Long Winter's Fibus for a theme song.

57:27.040 --> 57:29.040
It's a departure off the album, putting the days to bed,

57:29.040 --> 57:32.720
and a huge ups to Max Fun for having us on the network.

57:32.720 --> 57:33.120
Huge ups.

57:39.120 --> 57:40.160
I have a final Yahoo here.

57:40.160 --> 57:41.360
Hit me.

57:41.360 --> 57:43.520
Oh, this one was also sent in by Ben Kan.

57:43.520 --> 57:44.080
Thank you, Ben.

57:44.880 --> 57:47.120
It was asked by anonymous Yahoo Answers user,

57:47.120 --> 57:50.960
who I'm gonna call him Jim Davis.

57:51.600 --> 57:51.920
Okay.

57:52.480 --> 57:53.280
The Garfield guy.

57:54.240 --> 57:56.000
Because I think he would ask something like this.

57:57.280 --> 58:00.000
If Freddie Mercury was still alive,

58:00.000 --> 58:02.480
do you think he can play as Joker?

58:07.120 --> 58:07.440
Yes.

58:08.560 --> 58:10.000
My name is Justin McElroy.

58:10.000 --> 58:10.640
I'm Travis, then.

58:11.200 --> 58:12.480
I'm Griffin McElroy.

58:13.120 --> 58:14.320
This has been my brother, my brother.

58:14.320 --> 58:15.280
May it kiss your dad.

58:15.280 --> 58:16.240
Square on the lips.
