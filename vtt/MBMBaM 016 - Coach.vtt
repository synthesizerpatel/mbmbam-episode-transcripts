WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:14.400
I need help and I don't know where else to turn I've got a problem deep inside me and

00:14.400 --> 00:17.520
I'm feeling quite concerned It's an issue and I feel I need some input

00:17.520 --> 00:20.240
and insight Into if it's something serious or if I could

00:20.240 --> 00:24.000
just might be overreacting Got the problem I'm having and it's really

00:24.000 --> 00:28.000
no big deal and I should probably be laughing But I think I better talk to someone wiser

00:28.000 --> 00:31.040
than I Get a second opinion just to be on the safe

00:31.040 --> 00:32.040
side

00:32.040 --> 00:33.040
You know what?

00:33.040 --> 00:35.200
An opinion's three and four Cause I know just who I need

00:35.200 --> 00:37.840
I need the brothers McElroy Three sages from the past

00:37.840 --> 00:40.560
Dispensing wisdom for the ages The greatest modern minds

00:40.560 --> 00:43.240
Mending hearts like magic mages I could write pages

00:43.240 --> 00:45.800
About all they've done to help me Like when I caught on fire

00:45.800 --> 00:48.520
Or that time I lost my house keys I will never tire

00:48.520 --> 00:51.440
Of the way this show delights me Advice for the modern era

00:51.440 --> 00:52.920
It's my brother, my brother and me

00:52.920 --> 00:53.920
Just give me a big bottle of pee

00:53.920 --> 01:00.920
The bed you supplied us with is quite loud And we're afraid that our noise-making will

01:00.920 --> 01:06.920
be a ruckus So what bed might be quieter that you could

01:06.920 --> 01:07.920
accommodate us with?

01:07.920 --> 01:10.920
And also, where can I put my oversized duffel bag

01:10.920 --> 01:12.920
With the words, you need your bags

01:12.920 --> 01:24.920
If you change your mind, I'm the first in line Honey, I'm still free, take a chance on me

01:24.920 --> 01:29.920
If you need me, let me know, I'm gonna be around

01:29.920 --> 01:34.920
If you got no place to go when you're feeling down

01:34.920 --> 01:39.920
If you're all alone, when the pretty birds have flown

01:39.920 --> 01:44.920
Then let the money run free Take a chance on me

01:44.920 --> 01:46.920
Finally, being the one to recognize that the true sound

01:46.920 --> 01:50.920
Of my brother, my brother and me is rap

01:50.920 --> 01:53.920
It's the sweet sound of the streets

01:53.920 --> 01:57.920
We all agree that we are urban

01:57.920 --> 02:01.920
We are nothing if not street

02:01.920 --> 02:03.920
Hip-hop

02:03.920 --> 02:05.920
R&B

02:05.920 --> 02:08.920
Most of our episodes are about hip-hop and R&B

02:08.920 --> 02:13.920
I draw most of the things we say from the recordings of Jay-Z and Missile War in Hell

02:13.920 --> 02:20.920
Is it sad that for the better part of my entire life

02:20.920 --> 02:23.920
I thought R&B stood for Rap and Beats?

02:23.920 --> 02:26.920
What?

02:26.920 --> 02:28.920
When did you discover otherwise?

02:28.920 --> 02:31.920
I thought it stood for Rap and Beats

02:31.920 --> 02:33.920
This is My Brother, My Brother and Me

02:33.920 --> 02:36.920
And it's an advice show for the modern era

02:36.920 --> 02:43.920
We also will teach you that R&B does not stand for Rap and Beats

02:43.920 --> 02:44.920
What does it stand for?

02:44.920 --> 02:48.920
How well do you enjoy that Rap and Beats music?

02:48.920 --> 02:51.920
She's the greatest Rap and Beat singer of all time

02:51.920 --> 02:59.920
Aaliyah is the new princess of hip-hop and Rap and Beats

02:59.920 --> 03:00.920
God bless you

03:00.920 --> 03:03.920
Hello Brothers McElroy, this is Michael from California

03:03.920 --> 03:07.920
And I am wondering, how do you learn better?

03:07.920 --> 03:09.920
How do you learn to dress better?

03:09.920 --> 03:11.920
Sorry, got cut off a little bit

03:11.920 --> 03:13.920
That's not your fault, Michael

03:13.920 --> 03:15.920
I'm wondering, how do you learn to dress better?

03:15.920 --> 03:17.920
I'm tired of just wearing nerdy t-shirts all the time

03:17.920 --> 03:20.920
And I have no idea how to start learning how to dress more mature

03:20.920 --> 03:21.920
Thank you

03:21.920 --> 03:24.920
Griffin's got a great answer, watch this

03:24.920 --> 03:26.920
I do?

03:26.920 --> 03:30.920
Well, I was going to suggest that you need to watch a hit web series

03:30.920 --> 03:32.920
Oh, that's right

03:32.920 --> 03:35.920
That's called Put This On, by close personal friend of the show

03:35.920 --> 03:39.920
Jesse Thorn and Adam Lissagore

03:39.920 --> 03:42.920
Well, they are sort of friends of the show

03:42.920 --> 03:47.920
If you're here, thanks to our friends at Maximumfun.org

03:47.920 --> 03:51.920
You have probably heard the name Jesse Thorn

03:51.920 --> 03:55.920
Put This On, there's not enough episodes for my taste

03:55.920 --> 03:57.920
It's at PutThisOn.com

03:57.920 --> 04:00.920
There's just two right now about jeans and shoes

04:00.920 --> 04:02.920
That blog is chock full of tips

04:02.920 --> 04:04.920
What do they say about jeans?

04:04.920 --> 04:07.920
This is a discussion I've been having a lot lately

04:07.920 --> 04:15.920
Their conclusion is that jeans can qualify as fancy dress if worn properly

04:15.920 --> 04:18.920
You should watch it, Travis, you'll get into it

04:18.920 --> 04:21.920
Because it's all about finding a good pair of jeans for you

04:21.920 --> 04:23.920
And then how to maintain those jeans

04:23.920 --> 04:26.920
I was talking to Teresa the other day

04:26.920 --> 04:29.920
And I made her promise that when I reach the point

04:29.920 --> 04:33.920
That I'm too old to wear jeans

04:33.920 --> 04:35.920
That she is sworn to tell me

04:35.920 --> 04:37.920
So she can just kill you

04:37.920 --> 04:40.920
Yeah, and then it's just sweet, sweet death

04:40.920 --> 04:44.920
Let's get back to Michael's question

04:44.920 --> 04:50.920
I think you need to expand beyond nerdy t-shirts

04:50.920 --> 04:54.920
Because those are inherently undressy

04:54.920 --> 04:58.920
Find yourself a nice polo shirt

04:58.920 --> 05:01.920
A nice button up

05:01.920 --> 05:03.920
It's not that hard to dress better

05:03.920 --> 05:05.920
Yeah, just start at the ground up

05:05.920 --> 05:08.920
I would also say that you should

05:08.920 --> 05:14.920
That you could get a t-shirt that's not necessarily nerdy

05:14.920 --> 05:16.920
Maybe something more universal

05:16.920 --> 05:18.920
Something everyone can relate to

05:18.920 --> 05:21.920
Like, for instance, a My Brother, My Brother and Me t-shirt

05:21.920 --> 05:23.920
Available for one day only

05:23.920 --> 05:26.920
This final day at MBMBAM.com

05:26.920 --> 05:28.920
It may even be too late

05:28.920 --> 05:31.920
It may be too late if you're listening to this on Tuesday

05:31.920 --> 05:33.920
But still go look, we might work something out for you

05:33.920 --> 05:35.920
Or just plain t-shirts

05:35.920 --> 05:37.920
Plain t-shirts, that's a classy look

05:37.920 --> 05:40.920
Just a plain, tight fit

05:40.920 --> 05:43.920
You know what I like? A nice corduroy jacket

05:43.920 --> 05:45.920
You know what? A jacket is a good pro tip

05:45.920 --> 05:47.920
Because I could dress up anything

05:47.920 --> 05:52.920
I wear a nice tan jacket at trade shows and things

05:52.920 --> 05:57.920
Because it classes up the look without having to buy a whole new wardrobe

05:57.920 --> 05:59.920
Corduroy is good too though

05:59.920 --> 06:02.920
Go to Target and look at their jackets

06:02.920 --> 06:05.920
They have nice jackets for $20-$30

06:05.920 --> 06:08.920
And you'll wear those things for months

06:08.920 --> 06:09.920
100 years

06:09.920 --> 06:11.920
I finally found out, this is from Michael

06:11.920 --> 06:14.920
I recently found out that my wife and I are expecting a baby

06:14.920 --> 06:15.920
Mazel tov

06:15.920 --> 06:16.920
Congrats

06:16.920 --> 06:18.920
This will be our first

06:18.920 --> 06:20.920
So we're a little nervous about what to expect

06:20.920 --> 06:26.920
Immediately things changed my mind about priorities

06:26.920 --> 06:29.920
I'm also a little listener to the Joystick Podcast

06:29.920 --> 06:31.920
I love my gaming time

06:31.920 --> 06:34.920
How can I balance my new child and keep the trophies rolling in?

06:34.920 --> 06:36.920
First, that sounds dangerous

06:36.920 --> 06:39.920
If you're trying to balance a baby

06:39.920 --> 06:42.920
While at the same time trophies are rolling at you

06:42.920 --> 06:45.920
You may already be a bad parent

06:45.920 --> 06:47.920
Is the baby on your head?

06:47.920 --> 06:49.920
Is this where you're balancing him?

06:49.920 --> 06:50.920
Like a book?

06:50.920 --> 06:53.920
Like a hilarious silent film starring Buster Keaton

06:53.920 --> 06:57.920
There's a baby balanced precariously on your head as trophies roll at you

06:57.920 --> 06:59.920
I think the most important thing about being a parent

06:59.920 --> 07:02.920
Is knowing where to turn for advice about parenting

07:02.920 --> 07:05.920
It's definitely us

07:05.920 --> 07:09.920
You've already cracked the case with the first biggest problem

07:09.920 --> 07:11.920
Which is where to turn for parenting advice

07:11.920 --> 07:13.920
I've seen 3 men and a baby

07:13.920 --> 07:15.920
I've seen 4 men and a baby

07:15.920 --> 07:18.920
I've seen 2 and a half men

07:18.920 --> 07:21.920
I've seen babies stay out

07:21.920 --> 07:23.920
I've seen...

07:23.920 --> 07:25.920
Dunstan checks in

07:25.920 --> 07:28.920
Dunstan checks in, which isn't exactly about parenting

07:28.920 --> 07:30.920
I've seen most viable primate

07:30.920 --> 07:32.920
I've seen air bud

07:32.920 --> 07:35.920
I've seen most vertical primate

07:38.920 --> 07:40.920
We got off the subject right now

07:40.920 --> 07:42.920
I saw Milo and Otis

07:42.920 --> 07:45.920
Land Before Times Part 1, 2, 3, and 4

07:45.920 --> 07:47.920
Land of the Lost

07:47.920 --> 07:49.920
Listen

07:49.920 --> 07:51.920
Michael, the truth is

07:51.920 --> 07:53.920
The truth is, I think

07:53.920 --> 07:55.920
Fire, rain

07:55.920 --> 07:58.920
In order to be a good parent

07:58.920 --> 08:02.920
You have to not do the things that you used to like doing

08:02.920 --> 08:04.920
I think that there's a

08:04.920 --> 08:06.920
I think there's a ratio, an inverse

08:06.920 --> 08:11.920
Ratio between the sacrifices of your fun time

08:11.920 --> 08:15.920
To the relative health of your child

08:15.920 --> 08:17.920
Let me give you a trophy

08:17.920 --> 08:19.920
To reach for

08:19.920 --> 08:21.920
An achievement to try to gain

08:21.920 --> 08:23.920
And that is

08:23.920 --> 08:25.920
Didn't raise a serial killer

08:25.920 --> 08:28.920
100 gamer score

08:28.920 --> 08:32.920
100 gamer score for not raising someone who murders you in your sleep

08:32.920 --> 08:36.920
The way it works is when you grow up

08:36.920 --> 08:38.920
When you have a child

08:38.920 --> 08:40.920
You've been doing cool shit your whole life

08:40.920 --> 08:42.920
Now it's your child's turn to do cool shit

08:42.920 --> 08:44.920
And it's your time to do bummer shit

08:44.920 --> 08:46.920
It's like the Highlander

08:46.920 --> 08:48.920
There can be only one person who's

08:48.920 --> 08:50.920
Enjoying their life at one time

08:50.920 --> 08:52.920
And guess what friend

08:52.920 --> 08:54.920
It's not you anymore

08:54.920 --> 08:56.920
I'm 30 years old

08:56.920 --> 08:58.920
And have recently made a friend in World of Warcraft

08:58.920 --> 09:00.920
Who I've been playing with regularly

09:00.920 --> 09:02.920
Last week I found out he's a 15 year old boy

09:02.920 --> 09:04.920
And when I told my girlfriend

09:04.920 --> 09:06.920
She freaked out and said it was weird

09:06.920 --> 09:08.920
And that I should stop playing with him

09:08.920 --> 09:10.920
What do I do?

09:10.920 --> 09:12.920
I can't tell you the number of times my wife has walked in on me

09:12.920 --> 09:14.920
With a 15 year old boy

09:14.920 --> 09:16.920
And she's like oh no I'll call the cops

09:16.920 --> 09:18.920
I'll leave you blah blah blah blah

09:18.920 --> 09:20.920
It's like chill out lady

09:20.920 --> 09:22.920
He's our neighbor

09:22.920 --> 09:24.920
How am I gonna get better at recording pop music

09:24.920 --> 09:26.920
Well pop

09:26.920 --> 09:28.920
Pop influence by rapping beats

09:28.920 --> 09:30.920
Like Michael Jackson

09:30.920 --> 09:32.920
If I can't play with 15 year old boys

09:32.920 --> 09:34.920
Someone's gotta teach this kid to shave

09:34.920 --> 09:36.920
It's not gonna be his deadbeat dad

09:38.920 --> 09:40.920
You gotta be in front of the mirror

09:40.920 --> 09:42.920
With like whipped cream on his face and a spoon

09:42.920 --> 09:44.920
It's easy it's just like this

09:44.920 --> 09:46.920
It's real good slower

09:46.920 --> 09:48.920
Slower

09:48.920 --> 09:50.920
So much slower

09:50.920 --> 09:52.920
Daniel

09:52.920 --> 09:54.920
This is such a problem of the modern

09:54.920 --> 09:56.920
The modern age

09:56.920 --> 09:58.920
Yeah it is

09:58.920 --> 10:00.920
You know I imagine someone

10:00.920 --> 10:02.920
20 years ago reading this question

10:02.920 --> 10:04.920
Would think it was written

10:04.920 --> 10:06.920
In a different language

10:06.920 --> 10:08.920
I think

10:08.920 --> 10:10.920
When we talked about the question about

10:10.920 --> 10:12.920
Kissing your dad's square on the lips

10:12.920 --> 10:14.920
If you don't think it's weird then it's not

10:14.920 --> 10:16.920
Weird

10:16.920 --> 10:18.920
It is pretty fucking weird though

10:18.920 --> 10:20.920
It's weird though

10:20.920 --> 10:22.920
I assume you guys are just like rating

10:22.920 --> 10:24.920
Whatever people do on that World of Warcraft

10:24.920 --> 10:26.920
Jam

10:26.920 --> 10:28.920
There's nothing you can do

10:28.920 --> 10:30.920
In World of Warcraft with a 15 year old boy that doesn't make you sound like

10:30.920 --> 10:32.920
A gay pedophile

10:32.920 --> 10:34.920
We were just rating

10:34.920 --> 10:36.920
We were just pounding the dragon

10:36.920 --> 10:38.920
On our sewing

10:38.920 --> 10:40.920
We were just teaching him some leather work

10:40.920 --> 10:42.920
We were grinding

10:42.920 --> 10:44.920
We were just grinding

10:44.920 --> 10:46.920
I was grinding with a 15 year old and my wife

10:46.920 --> 10:48.920
Flipped

10:48.920 --> 10:50.920
This is

10:50.920 --> 10:52.920
This is something where

10:52.920 --> 10:54.920
Just pretend you don't know it

10:54.920 --> 10:56.920
Are you sure it's not Chris Hanson on the other end

10:56.920 --> 10:58.920
Saying he's a 15 year old boy

10:58.920 --> 11:00.920
That's the future of To Catch a Predator

11:00.920 --> 11:02.920
Why are you hanging with him?

11:02.920 --> 11:04.920
Maybe find someone your own age

11:04.920 --> 11:06.920
Also playing World of Warcraft

11:06.920 --> 11:08.920
Or switch to Second Life

11:08.920 --> 11:10.920
Because that place is just

11:10.920 --> 11:12.920
Just ripe for the harvest

11:12.920 --> 11:14.920
Of just sweet

11:14.920 --> 11:16.920
Sweet succulent teenage fruit

11:16.920 --> 11:18.920
Just hanging

11:18.920 --> 11:20.920
Hanging low on the tree

11:22.920 --> 11:24.920
You know there's Marshall in Second Life now

11:24.920 --> 11:26.920
Yeah I saw that

11:26.920 --> 11:28.920
Marshall University, my alma mater

11:28.920 --> 11:30.920
And Justin's alma mater

11:30.920 --> 11:32.920
Now has a virtual college

11:32.920 --> 11:34.920
In Second Life

11:34.920 --> 11:36.920
Am I allowed to

11:36.920 --> 11:38.920
I haven't discussed this with my wife

11:38.920 --> 11:40.920
Am I allowed to go to virtual Marshall

11:40.920 --> 11:42.920
And do the things that I did at real Marshall

11:42.920 --> 11:44.920
Without fear of repercussions?

11:44.920 --> 11:46.920
Is that how that works?

11:46.920 --> 11:48.920
Well give me an example of some of these things

11:48.920 --> 11:50.920
Like

11:50.920 --> 11:52.920
If I go to Second Life

11:52.920 --> 11:54.920
Can I set a

11:54.920 --> 11:56.920
Dumpster on fire and then blame it

11:56.920 --> 11:58.920
On a pizza guy that walked by earlier

11:58.920 --> 12:00.920
Is that okay?

12:00.920 --> 12:02.920
I mean it depends if the programmers

12:02.920 --> 12:04.920
Have enabled that

12:04.920 --> 12:06.920
Option for you to do in the game

12:06.920 --> 12:08.920
How's your tech?

12:08.920 --> 12:10.920
How is the tech on this if I can't burn

12:10.920 --> 12:12.920
A dumpster?

12:12.920 --> 12:14.920
I don't know

12:14.920 --> 12:16.920
I would love to see if I could get kicked out of

12:16.920 --> 12:18.920
Second Life Marshall though

12:18.920 --> 12:20.920
I would love to see what it takes to do

12:20.920 --> 12:22.920
When you do you have to walk out screaming

12:22.920 --> 12:24.920
That's it I'm starting Third Life

12:24.920 --> 12:26.920
On one hand

12:26.920 --> 12:28.920
You have it as a recruitment tool

12:28.920 --> 12:30.920
That's what they built it for

12:30.920 --> 12:32.920
So that they can take students on a virtual tour

12:32.920 --> 12:34.920
So I'd love to show up as a prospective

12:34.920 --> 12:36.920
You know student

12:36.920 --> 12:38.920
And walk around that group

12:38.920 --> 12:40.920
And cause all kinds of shenanigans

12:40.920 --> 12:42.920
I'd just like to sit on the quad

12:42.920 --> 12:44.920
And play my guitar that's it

12:44.920 --> 12:46.920
Just don't bother me

12:46.920 --> 12:48.920
Just run into the middle of a group? You guys trying to sack?

12:48.920 --> 12:50.920
You guys want to sack?

12:50.920 --> 12:52.920
We're going to sack over at the student center in 15

12:52.920 --> 12:54.920
Meet by the John and my 15 year old friend

12:54.920 --> 12:56.920
We're just sacking together

12:56.920 --> 12:58.920
We're going to do some disc

12:58.920 --> 13:00.920
You guys like Dave Matthews?

13:00.920 --> 13:02.920
It's a crazy game of poker

13:02.920 --> 13:04.920
Today right?

13:04.920 --> 13:06.920
Allen writes from Gmail

13:06.920 --> 13:08.920
I'm starting my senior year of high school

13:08.920 --> 13:10.920
And my parents are becoming increasingly pushy

13:10.920 --> 13:12.920
About telling me I need to decide where I want to go

13:12.920 --> 13:14.920
To college

13:14.920 --> 13:16.920
Have you considered Marshall?

13:16.920 --> 13:18.920
Have you considered virtual Marshall?

13:18.920 --> 13:20.920
Have you considered VMU?

13:20.920 --> 13:22.920
I'm at the top of my class and should have no problem

13:22.920 --> 13:24.920
Getting a scholarship the problem is

13:24.920 --> 13:26.920
I have no idea what I want to do

13:26.920 --> 13:28.920
I'm equally good in all subjects at school

13:28.920 --> 13:30.920
But I don't like any of them enough to devote

13:30.920 --> 13:32.920
48 years of my life to studying them

13:32.920 --> 13:34.920
Furthermore I cannot think of any real job

13:34.920 --> 13:36.920
I would enjoy

13:36.920 --> 13:38.920
How can I find out what to do with my life?

13:38.920 --> 13:40.920
Oh Allen

13:40.920 --> 13:42.920
Allen Allen Allen

13:42.920 --> 13:44.920
That's a great question

13:44.920 --> 13:46.920
I mean you're asking

13:46.920 --> 13:48.920
Maybe the only person who

13:48.920 --> 13:50.920
Really can provide

13:50.920 --> 13:52.920
Well I guess Travis and Griffin are both better at this than I am

13:52.920 --> 13:54.920
I went to school on an acting and directing degree

13:54.920 --> 13:56.920
And I

13:56.920 --> 13:58.920
And I

13:58.920 --> 14:00.920
Now I write about video games so

14:00.920 --> 14:02.920
I don't know

14:02.920 --> 14:04.920
I think I heard someone say that if

14:04.920 --> 14:06.920
That if

14:06.920 --> 14:08.920
College only teaches you

14:08.920 --> 14:10.920
What you want to do with your life then it's

14:10.920 --> 14:12.920
A good investment but I don't know

14:12.920 --> 14:14.920
What do you guys think?

14:14.920 --> 14:16.920
I think that there's two kinds of people

14:16.920 --> 14:18.920
There are people that have known what they've wanted to do since they were 8 years old

14:18.920 --> 14:20.920
There's people that are going to figure out

14:20.920 --> 14:22.920
What they're going to do when they're 22 and like

14:22.920 --> 14:24.920
Are handed a diploma

14:24.920 --> 14:26.920
And you know both of those people

14:26.920 --> 14:28.920
End up knowing what they're going to do

14:28.920 --> 14:30.920
And there are people like Allen

14:30.920 --> 14:32.920
Griffin

14:32.920 --> 14:34.920
You were saying?

14:34.920 --> 14:36.920
There are people like Allen who will never find out what they want to do

14:36.920 --> 14:38.920
And will die purpose

14:38.920 --> 14:40.920
You know I'm glad you were

14:40.920 --> 14:42.920
Trying to cut Travis off to tell

14:42.920 --> 14:44.920
Allen that he was going to die without

14:44.920 --> 14:46.920
Purpose

14:46.920 --> 14:48.920
Not completely without purpose

14:48.920 --> 14:50.920
But a great use of the

14:50.920 --> 14:52.920
Without a fulfilling purpose

14:52.920 --> 14:54.920
Do you think he'll be on his deathbed and he'll look back and say

14:54.920 --> 14:56.920
I wasted it

14:56.920 --> 14:58.920
I wasted it all

14:58.920 --> 15:00.920
You were right Griffin

15:00.920 --> 15:02.920
Excuse me Travis can I cut in on what you're saying

15:02.920 --> 15:04.920
To remind one of our precious listeners

15:04.920 --> 15:06.920
That his life is a shell

15:06.920 --> 15:08.920
Allen listen

15:08.920 --> 15:10.920
I hate to add to your burden but this is

15:10.920 --> 15:12.920
The most important decision you'll ever make

15:12.920 --> 15:14.920
So you need to spend the last

15:14.920 --> 15:16.920
Few few months

15:16.920 --> 15:18.920
You have left in high school

15:18.920 --> 15:20.920
Doing as much shit as you

15:20.920 --> 15:22.920
Possibly can

15:22.920 --> 15:24.920
Extracurriculars

15:24.920 --> 15:26.920
Join the

15:26.920 --> 15:28.920
Theater community

15:28.920 --> 15:30.920
And choreograph their upcoming

15:30.920 --> 15:32.920
Production of Oklahoma

15:32.920 --> 15:34.920
Go join your

15:34.920 --> 15:36.920
School newspaper

15:36.920 --> 15:38.920
Play some football do some sports

15:38.920 --> 15:40.920
Commentating

15:40.920 --> 15:42.920
Anything you can to try and find

15:42.920 --> 15:44.920
Your calling because it's out there

15:44.920 --> 15:46.920
You just gotta stumble upon it

15:46.920 --> 15:48.920
I would suggest Allen this is such a hard decision

15:48.920 --> 15:50.920
Because it's a weird system we have where we

15:50.920 --> 15:52.920
Ask people to choose what they

15:52.920 --> 15:54.920
Want to do with their lives before they have a chance

15:54.920 --> 15:56.920
To actually do anything

15:56.920 --> 15:58.920
If I might be so bold

15:58.920 --> 16:00.920
Why don't you try talking to some people

16:00.920 --> 16:02.920
Pick some careers you might be interested in

16:02.920 --> 16:04.920
And talk to some people who are currently

16:04.920 --> 16:06.920
In those careers and see how they

16:06.920 --> 16:08.920
Like it because that's a

16:08.920 --> 16:10.920
Pretty good barometer of whether or not

16:10.920 --> 16:12.920
If it's making them happy then

16:12.920 --> 16:14.920
I actually made my decision to go into

16:14.920 --> 16:16.920
Journalism because I did

16:16.920 --> 16:18.920
It a bit in high school and I enjoyed it but I was a

16:18.920 --> 16:20.920
Theater major in high school but I watched

16:20.920 --> 16:22.920
Justin in

16:22.920 --> 16:24.920
College go from

16:24.920 --> 16:26.920
Having this theater degree that he didn't

16:26.920 --> 16:28.920
You know want to use in his

16:28.920 --> 16:30.920
Professional life and making a

16:30.920 --> 16:32.920
Last minute change to journalism

16:32.920 --> 16:34.920
And I was like man I don't want any of that

16:34.920 --> 16:36.920
I don't want to do that

16:36.920 --> 16:38.920
I don't want that life that's for certain

16:38.920 --> 16:40.920
Sir that is great I am so

16:40.920 --> 16:42.920
Glad that my life could serve as a negative

16:42.920 --> 16:44.920
Example for how not to live your life

16:44.920 --> 16:46.920
No not a negative example

16:46.920 --> 16:48.920
That trailblazing guidance for you you piece

16:48.920 --> 16:50.920
Of shit

16:50.920 --> 16:52.920
Forum spring asks is it considered

16:52.920 --> 16:54.920
Cheating if I make out with a gay man

16:54.920 --> 16:56.920
Assuming that you're a

16:56.920 --> 16:58.920
Man okay wait there's so many people

16:58.920 --> 17:00.920
You gotta give us enough

17:00.920 --> 17:02.920
Context to answer these questions

17:02.920 --> 17:04.920
Are you dating the gay man

17:04.920 --> 17:06.920
No then it's not cheating

17:06.920 --> 17:08.920
Are you dating a girl

17:08.920 --> 17:10.920
I think it is a she there a girl

17:10.920 --> 17:12.920
Who is dating a guy is it

17:12.920 --> 17:14.920
Cheating if she makes out with a

17:14.920 --> 17:16.920
Gay man god that's such an answer

17:16.920 --> 17:18.920
Is the answer is yes

17:18.920 --> 17:20.920
Of course of course it is

17:20.920 --> 17:22.920
You know do you know how you know what's

17:22.920 --> 17:24.920
A sin would you do it in front of jesus

17:24.920 --> 17:26.920
Not kind of masturbation which

17:26.920 --> 17:28.920
Is a problem because I would

17:28.920 --> 17:30.920
Totally do that from jesus

17:30.920 --> 17:32.920
So if you're okay so if you're a girl

17:32.920 --> 17:34.920
This is the whole thing this is how

17:34.920 --> 17:36.920
You determine cheating right would you

17:36.920 --> 17:38.920
Do it in front of them if you

17:38.920 --> 17:40.920
Wouldn't do it in front of them then it's cheating

17:40.920 --> 17:42.920
If you would do it in front of them

17:42.920 --> 17:44.920
Then they're cool with it and you're fine it's one of those

17:44.920 --> 17:46.920
How would you feel like if you

17:46.920 --> 17:48.920
Have to ask then

17:48.920 --> 17:50.920
It is yeah

17:50.920 --> 17:52.920
How about it's not cheating if you make out with

17:52.920 --> 17:54.920
That gay man if I go over here and make

17:54.920 --> 17:56.920
Out with this lesbian that cool yeah

17:56.920 --> 17:58.920
We cool nice

17:58.920 --> 18:00.920
This is a real healthy relationship we got going

18:00.920 --> 18:02.920
On here with Portia de Rossi is

18:02.920 --> 18:04.920
Are you are you cool are you cool

18:04.920 --> 18:06.920
For you because it's

18:06.920 --> 18:08.920
Fact it is stone cold

18:08.920 --> 18:10.920
Fact that every girl

18:10.920 --> 18:12.920
Freshman year of college is

18:12.920 --> 18:14.920
Going to make out with a gay man that's that's 100

18:14.920 --> 18:16.920
Percent I think it was actually part of

18:16.920 --> 18:18.920
The marshall plan you couldn't graduate from

18:18.920 --> 18:20.920
From three of the

18:20.920 --> 18:22.920
Twelve schools at marshall unless

18:22.920 --> 18:24.920
You had made out with a gay man it was

18:24.920 --> 18:26.920
A prerequisite and that same

18:26.920 --> 18:28.920
Gay man will flamboyantly

18:28.920 --> 18:30.920
Squeeze one or more of her breasts

18:30.920 --> 18:32.920
If they honk it was

18:32.920 --> 18:34.920
Just one gay man

18:34.920 --> 18:36.920
It was marshall's marshall's gay

18:36.920 --> 18:38.920
Man and everyone had to make out with him

18:38.920 --> 18:40.920
In order to graduate college his name actually

18:40.920 --> 18:42.920
Funny enough marshall gayman

18:46.920 --> 18:48.920
Is it cheating is really easy

18:48.920 --> 18:50.920
To answer because it's all about

18:50.920 --> 18:52.920
Your partner's perception if they think

18:52.920 --> 18:54.920
It's cheating

18:54.920 --> 18:56.920
It's cheating if you can't

18:56.920 --> 18:58.920
Ask them like is it cool that I made out

18:58.920 --> 19:00.920
With a gay are you asking me if you should feel guilty

19:00.920 --> 19:02.920
I don't know guilt fades are

19:02.920 --> 19:04.920
You going to do anything about you're not going to start a relationship

19:04.920 --> 19:06.920
With this guy so

19:06.920 --> 19:08.920
I don't think you should tell the person

19:08.920 --> 19:10.920
Like especially if it's going to create

19:10.920 --> 19:12.920
Well let me I mean if you can let

19:12.920 --> 19:14.920
It slide then don't

19:14.920 --> 19:16.920
Tell them because it's just going to hurt their feelings especially

19:16.920 --> 19:18.920
Because that's not

19:18.920 --> 19:20.920
A sexual preference like girls who

19:20.920 --> 19:22.920
Are into gay dudes it's not like

19:22.920 --> 19:24.920
It's not maybe it is I don't know

19:24.920 --> 19:26.920
Maybe it is well let me ask you this turn

19:26.920 --> 19:28.920
Around it's probably a katherine heigl movie about it

19:28.920 --> 19:30.920
Is a straight girl asking this question

19:30.920 --> 19:32.920
If she makes out with another straight girl

19:32.920 --> 19:34.920
Is that cheating

19:34.920 --> 19:36.920
There are so

19:36.920 --> 19:38.920
Many layers to that question no it's

19:38.920 --> 19:40.920
It's irrelevant it has everything

19:40.920 --> 19:42.920
To do it has nothing to do with what

19:42.920 --> 19:44.920
The

19:44.920 --> 19:46.920
Planets leading advice podcast says

19:46.920 --> 19:48.920
And more about

19:48.920 --> 19:50.920
What it has everything

19:50.920 --> 19:52.920
To do with what your dude thinks

19:52.920 --> 19:54.920
So if he's cool

19:54.920 --> 19:56.920
If he's like this doesn't bother me at all

19:56.920 --> 19:58.920
It's not cheating if he's not

19:58.920 --> 20:00.920
Cool it's fully fully

20:00.920 --> 20:02.920
And also be prepared for him to say he's

20:02.920 --> 20:04.920
Cool but he's probably not just don't do it

20:04.920 --> 20:06.920
How about you just don't make out with gay dudes

20:06.920 --> 20:08.920
Anymore you already did it

20:08.920 --> 20:10.920
Didn't you but using that metric like

20:10.920 --> 20:12.920
Any any like

20:12.920 --> 20:14.920
Your boyfriend could think that splitting a pizza

20:14.920 --> 20:16.920
With another dude is cheating like

20:16.920 --> 20:18.920
There has to be

20:18.920 --> 20:20.920
But if you

20:20.920 --> 20:22.920
Presumably if you're asking what is

20:22.920 --> 20:24.920
Cheating you're doing it because you're

20:24.920 --> 20:26.920
Worried that your partner will

20:26.920 --> 20:28.920
Dump you

20:28.920 --> 20:30.920
If if they

20:30.920 --> 20:32.920
Think you've been cheating so

20:32.920 --> 20:34.920
It has everything to do with what they

20:34.920 --> 20:36.920
Consider cheating and I mean

20:36.920 --> 20:38.920
Like if they're the sort of person if

20:38.920 --> 20:40.920
They do consider splitting a pizza with a dude cheating

20:40.920 --> 20:42.920
You need to break up with him

20:42.920 --> 20:44.920
You need to break up with him be are you sure

20:44.920 --> 20:46.920
That's not the name of some kind of crazy new sex thing

20:46.920 --> 20:48.920
Kids today

20:48.920 --> 20:50.920
With him

20:50.920 --> 20:52.920
With him gross and I kissed

20:52.920 --> 20:54.920
You I just kissed you I'm gonna go

20:54.920 --> 20:56.920
Vomit and then cut my tongue off

20:56.920 --> 20:58.920
I think just as a

20:58.920 --> 21:00.920
Good ground rule don't make out with anybody

21:00.920 --> 21:02.920
That's not your significant other

21:02.920 --> 21:04.920
Just to be on the safe side

21:04.920 --> 21:06.920
Probably don't make out with anybody else

21:06.920 --> 21:08.920
Unless they're famous

21:08.920 --> 21:10.920
Unless they're famous and that's always

21:10.920 --> 21:12.920
Just for the story

21:12.920 --> 21:14.920
Yahoo answers user Jake Sully

21:14.920 --> 21:16.920
Asks would you book an international

21:16.920 --> 21:18.920
Flight on 9-11

21:18.920 --> 21:20.920
Some people are superstitious

21:20.920 --> 21:22.920
And won't what about you I wanted to book

21:22.920 --> 21:24.920
A flight to London in September and I see

21:24.920 --> 21:26.920
On 9-11 some flights are a bit cheaper

21:26.920 --> 21:28.920
I am wondering why

21:28.920 --> 21:30.920
Jake Sully

21:30.920 --> 21:32.920
Was not as you might imagine

21:32.920 --> 21:34.920
Booking a flight to Pandora

21:34.920 --> 21:36.920
He would do that on 9-11

21:36.920 --> 21:38.920
If that was the only day it was available

21:38.920 --> 21:40.920
Is that international travel flying to Pandora

21:40.920 --> 21:42.920
On 9-11

21:42.920 --> 21:44.920
Is that the guy from I still haven't seen

21:44.920 --> 21:46.920
Pandora is that yeah Pandora

21:46.920 --> 21:48.920
By James Cameroon what

21:48.920 --> 21:50.920
No it's called Avatar

21:50.920 --> 21:52.920
Oh right again

21:52.920 --> 21:54.920
Was that a

21:54.920 --> 21:56.920
Was that the 3D one

21:56.920 --> 21:58.920
It's the one from

21:58.920 --> 22:00.920
And he goes to the core of the earth

22:00.920 --> 22:02.920
And then he finds smurfs

22:02.920 --> 22:04.920
And they're giant giant smurfs man eating

22:04.920 --> 22:06.920
Smurfs and he and

22:06.920 --> 22:08.920
Native Americans

22:08.920 --> 22:10.920
Fight to defend the core of the earth

22:10.920 --> 22:12.920
Justin how did you get into my dream last night

22:12.920 --> 22:18.920
Now that's a movie James Cameroon

22:18.920 --> 22:20.920
Either that or T4

22:20.920 --> 22:22.920
That's what I want from you

22:22.920 --> 22:24.920
Or is it T5 I guess

22:24.920 --> 22:26.920
Jake Sully listen

22:26.920 --> 22:28.920
Jake Sully

22:28.920 --> 22:30.920
Lightning don't strike twice in the same place

22:30.920 --> 22:32.920
I think I would

22:32.920 --> 22:34.920
I would only fly on 9-11

22:34.920 --> 22:36.920
That is the safest day to fly

22:36.920 --> 22:38.920
That is the safest day to fly

22:38.920 --> 22:40.920
Everyone knows that if there's one thing

22:40.920 --> 22:42.920
Terrorists are afraid of it's cliches

22:46.920 --> 22:48.920
9-11 been there done that

22:48.920 --> 22:50.920
I was in the 9-11

22:50.920 --> 22:52.920
Yeah I was in the 9-11 before it was cool

22:52.920 --> 22:54.920
9-11 was so 2001

22:54.920 --> 22:56.920
Ever since

22:56.920 --> 22:58.920
Ever since they used 9-11

22:58.920 --> 23:00.920
In that episode of the OC it was like

23:00.920 --> 23:02.920
Everybody was in the 9-11

23:02.920 --> 23:04.920
I was like well kinda over it

23:04.920 --> 23:06.920
9-12 I think

23:06.920 --> 23:08.920
Is what you need to be worried about

23:08.920 --> 23:10.920
9-12 is the day man

23:10.920 --> 23:12.920
Or 9-10 where everybody is just getting psyched

23:12.920 --> 23:14.920
For 9-11 and then it's like what happened?

23:14.920 --> 23:16.920
Doing some pre-gaming

23:16.920 --> 23:18.920
Actually what you need to be afraid of

23:18.920 --> 23:20.920
3-12

23:20.920 --> 23:22.920
Just trust me I've got a bad feeling

23:22.920 --> 23:24.920
Really?

23:24.920 --> 23:26.920
3-12

23:26.920 --> 23:28.920
I have a question I hope you can help me with

23:28.920 --> 23:30.920
In 2012 you mean

23:30.920 --> 23:32.920
My wife and I have two kids

23:32.920 --> 23:34.920
A two year old girl and a five year old boy

23:34.920 --> 23:36.920
Ever since my son could speak

23:36.920 --> 23:38.920
I've been discriminating about one thing

23:38.920 --> 23:40.920
What's called his private area

23:40.920 --> 23:42.920
My wife, I would just call it his bedroom

23:42.920 --> 23:44.920
But my wife being a traditionalist

23:44.920 --> 23:46.920
Refers to it as his penis

23:46.920 --> 23:48.920
I being a little more hip call it his junk

23:48.920 --> 23:50.920
Now when he refers to it

23:50.920 --> 23:52.920
As his junk

23:52.920 --> 23:54.920
My wife cringes and gives me dirty looks

23:54.920 --> 23:56.920
What do you guys think?

23:56.920 --> 23:58.920
Where do you stay on the matter?

23:58.920 --> 24:00.920
I think you need to think about what's creepier

24:00.920 --> 24:02.920
That or a little three year old kid saying

24:02.920 --> 24:04.920
Excuse me papa my penis

24:04.920 --> 24:06.920
Eww

24:08.920 --> 24:10.920
What happened to wiener?

24:10.920 --> 24:12.920
Why can't kids call it their worm?

24:12.920 --> 24:14.920
You know what, yeah there it is

24:14.920 --> 24:16.920
Wormy was my option until

24:16.920 --> 24:18.920
The sophomore year of high school

24:18.920 --> 24:20.920
The sophomore year of high school

24:20.920 --> 24:22.920
Which got awkward

24:22.920 --> 24:24.920
Once the intimate times started up

24:26.920 --> 24:28.920
Like at a high school dancing

24:28.920 --> 24:30.920
Can you feel

24:30.920 --> 24:32.920
My wormy poking through these

24:32.920 --> 24:34.920
These Jess pants

24:34.920 --> 24:36.920
Here comes the wormy

24:36.920 --> 24:38.920
These fashionable slacks

24:38.920 --> 24:40.920
The early bird gets this wormy

24:42.920 --> 24:44.920
What do you girls think is going to be the early bird?

24:44.920 --> 24:46.920
I think you should teach your son

24:46.920 --> 24:48.920
To be ashamed of his sexuality

24:48.920 --> 24:50.920
And not refer to it at all

24:50.920 --> 24:52.920
Yeah, just every time he brings it up

24:52.920 --> 24:54.920
Hose him down

24:54.920 --> 24:56.920
Have you considered my shame?

24:56.920 --> 24:58.920
My shame, my evil, my pants evil

24:58.920 --> 25:00.920
Now what is

25:00.920 --> 25:02.920
What's going on in your five year old's life

25:02.920 --> 25:04.920
That this is a

25:04.920 --> 25:06.920
Recurring problem for you

25:06.920 --> 25:08.920
Yo pops, what do I call this thing?

25:08.920 --> 25:10.920
What's the deal with the dangle?

25:10.920 --> 25:12.920
Can you talk about my junk?

25:12.920 --> 25:14.920
Jimmy kindergarten says

25:14.920 --> 25:16.920
To call it my cock and balls

25:16.920 --> 25:18.920
Teach gets mad when I call it that

25:18.920 --> 25:20.920
What do I calls it?

25:22.920 --> 25:24.920
Well Ali G

25:24.920 --> 25:26.920
I don't know how you got in place

25:26.920 --> 25:28.920
With my son, can I suggest

25:28.920 --> 25:30.920
Maybe you let him name it

25:30.920 --> 25:32.920
I just came up with a bad name for it

25:32.920 --> 25:34.920
His wiener machine

25:36.920 --> 25:38.920
His wiener machine

25:38.920 --> 25:40.920
What about something nice and

25:40.920 --> 25:42.920
Non specific like coach

25:44.920 --> 25:46.920
Coach is good cause he like

25:46.920 --> 25:48.920
He tells you what to do

25:48.920 --> 25:50.920
And plus he's got a whistle

25:50.920 --> 25:52.920
He's got a whistle

25:52.920 --> 25:54.920
Do you guys not have that?

25:54.920 --> 25:56.920
Don't gatorade on him

26:02.920 --> 26:04.920
Call yours coach and call his assistant coach

26:06.920 --> 26:08.920
And then one is your special teams coach

26:10.920 --> 26:12.920
Special teams coach, that's your b-hole

26:14.920 --> 26:16.920
I think the real problem you're faced with is

26:16.920 --> 26:18.920
Your two year old girl will eventually need to have

26:18.920 --> 26:20.920
The same conversation

26:20.920 --> 26:22.920
And my advice to you is

26:22.920 --> 26:24.920
You need to get out of it

26:24.920 --> 26:26.920
There's gonna be a house word for this

26:26.920 --> 26:28.920
And you've gotta be careful because someday

26:28.920 --> 26:30.920
Your little girl is gonna be married

26:30.920 --> 26:32.920
And she's gonna be

26:32.920 --> 26:34.920
You see the problem here

26:34.920 --> 26:36.920
This has gotta be a nice non specific word

26:36.920 --> 26:38.920
You know what I mean

26:38.920 --> 26:40.920
Like vagina flower

26:40.920 --> 26:42.920
Don't call the penis the vagina

26:42.920 --> 26:44.920
That is not gonna teach him anything

26:44.920 --> 26:46.920
How about

26:46.920 --> 26:48.920
How about this

26:48.920 --> 26:52.920
How about

26:52.920 --> 26:54.920
What about penis

26:54.920 --> 26:56.920
I think your wife is right

26:56.920 --> 26:58.920
I think if everybody's calling it a penis

26:58.920 --> 27:00.920
You're gonna take the power away from that word

27:00.920 --> 27:02.920
And plus you set up that really great moment

27:02.920 --> 27:04.920
In sex ed in high school

27:04.920 --> 27:06.920
Where she just slowly raises her hand

27:06.920 --> 27:08.920
She's like um

27:08.920 --> 27:10.920
I'm very confused

27:10.920 --> 27:12.920
What about pistol

27:12.920 --> 27:14.920
And tell your girls hers is called a stamen

27:14.920 --> 27:16.920
It'll just really mess them up

27:16.920 --> 27:18.920
I have

27:18.920 --> 27:20.920
That one was from Scott by the way

27:20.920 --> 27:22.920
We didn't say his name

27:22.920 --> 27:24.920
We don't want you to get confused

27:24.920 --> 27:26.920
That was from you

27:26.920 --> 27:28.920
If somebody else had written it

27:28.920 --> 27:30.920
We might have given them a different answer

27:30.920 --> 27:32.920
What's our final decision on this

27:32.920 --> 27:34.920
Coach and pistol

27:34.920 --> 27:36.920
Or coach pistols

27:36.920 --> 27:38.920
I have conflicting views about pornography

27:38.920 --> 27:40.920
Says an anonymous writer from gmail

27:40.920 --> 27:42.920
I love it

27:42.920 --> 27:44.920
But I realize in most of its forms

27:44.920 --> 27:46.920
It's degrading to women okay

27:46.920 --> 27:48.920
Also my girlfriend commanded I quit watching it

27:48.920 --> 27:50.920
And I hate to have to lie to her

27:50.920 --> 27:52.920
Because I still watch it anyway

27:52.920 --> 27:54.920
Quit watching it

27:54.920 --> 27:56.920
Should I try to resist these animal impulses

27:56.920 --> 27:58.920
And live a life of celibacy

27:58.920 --> 28:00.920
Only jerking off to my imagination

28:00.920 --> 28:02.920
Or am I blowing this out of proportion

28:02.920 --> 28:04.920
Should I try to find feminist porn

28:04.920 --> 28:06.920
Does it exist

28:06.920 --> 28:08.920
Um

28:08.920 --> 28:10.920
I'm sure it exists

28:10.920 --> 28:12.920
Are you listening to it right now dude

28:12.920 --> 28:14.920
Turn it off and let's just talk

28:14.920 --> 28:16.920
For one second

28:16.920 --> 28:18.920
No off don't just mute it off

28:18.920 --> 28:20.920
Thank you

28:20.920 --> 28:22.920
If there is foot crush porn

28:22.920 --> 28:24.920
There is probably feminist porn

28:24.920 --> 28:26.920
I don't think that's up for debate

28:26.920 --> 28:28.920
Um

28:28.920 --> 28:30.920
I think you could probably google it

28:30.920 --> 28:32.920
Though I

28:32.920 --> 28:34.920
Be careful

28:34.920 --> 28:36.920
Um cause you could end up with

28:36.920 --> 28:38.920
Femma piss porn that's not good

28:38.920 --> 28:40.920
Or Femma mist porn and that's

28:40.920 --> 28:42.920
Really weird

28:42.920 --> 28:44.920
And listen buddy we understand where you're coming from

28:44.920 --> 28:46.920
And we know you better than this

28:46.920 --> 28:48.920
But the next time you have this conversation with someone

28:48.920 --> 28:50.920
Leave out the phrase animal impulses

28:50.920 --> 28:52.920
It sends

28:52.920 --> 28:54.920
A bad message that I don't think

28:54.920 --> 28:56.920
You wanna put out there

28:56.920 --> 28:58.920
Listen anonymous here

28:58.920 --> 29:00.920
Is hungry like the wolf

29:00.920 --> 29:02.920
For sweet internet

29:02.920 --> 29:04.920
He's on the lookout

29:04.920 --> 29:06.920
I think he just wrote us to get recommendations

29:06.920 --> 29:08.920
On sites

29:08.920 --> 29:10.920
What are the hot sites you guys are into

29:10.920 --> 29:12.920
These days for feminist porn

29:12.920 --> 29:14.920
First off thank your girlfriend

29:14.920 --> 29:16.920
For

29:16.920 --> 29:18.920
Porn can so quickly

29:18.920 --> 29:20.920
Turn kind of stale

29:20.920 --> 29:22.920
So thank your girlfriend for making it dirty

29:22.920 --> 29:24.920
And elicit and sexier than ever

29:24.920 --> 29:26.920
By foreboding

29:26.920 --> 29:28.920
You from looking at it yes

29:28.920 --> 29:30.920
The danger

29:30.920 --> 29:32.920
The trick is something he brought up

29:32.920 --> 29:34.920
Which is his imagination

29:34.920 --> 29:36.920
Let me tell you something

29:36.920 --> 29:38.920
The scenarios

29:38.920 --> 29:40.920
You can invent up in your noodle

29:40.920 --> 29:42.920
Up there way better

29:42.920 --> 29:44.920
Than anything on the net

29:44.920 --> 29:46.920
Well hello Ms. Ellen DeGeneres

29:46.920 --> 29:48.920
Except

29:48.920 --> 29:50.920
This is me

29:52.920 --> 29:54.920
But

29:54.920 --> 29:56.920
To answer your question really

29:56.920 --> 29:58.920
Don't be a sicko

29:58.920 --> 30:00.920
Shit's unhealthy

30:00.920 --> 30:02.920
There is nothing sick about watching porn

30:02.920 --> 30:04.920
Throwing it out there

30:04.920 --> 30:06.920
Yeah it's not good you should never watch porn

30:06.920 --> 30:08.920
You guys

30:08.920 --> 30:10.920
I'm trying to make it dirtier

30:10.920 --> 30:12.920
I'm trying to make it dirtier for him

30:12.920 --> 30:14.920
My brother and me and my girlfriend

30:14.920 --> 30:16.920
Listen here naughty boy

30:16.920 --> 30:18.920
It's so bad

30:18.920 --> 30:20.920
Oh god it's gross

30:20.920 --> 30:22.920
Take off those dungarees and let's get you punished

30:22.920 --> 30:24.920
No

30:24.920 --> 30:26.920
Get that one out

30:26.920 --> 30:28.920
Oh no

30:28.920 --> 30:30.920
Benjamin

30:30.920 --> 30:32.920
Benjamin writes to us from gmail

30:32.920 --> 30:34.920
Um

30:34.920 --> 30:36.920
Good luck

30:36.920 --> 30:38.920
Can you put this in here

30:38.920 --> 30:40.920
That may have been me

30:40.920 --> 30:42.920
Okay

30:42.920 --> 30:44.920
This one's for you

30:44.920 --> 30:46.920
I love your show

30:46.920 --> 30:48.920
I'll be 13 on August 20th

30:48.920 --> 30:50.920
Griffin is my favorite person on MB&B AM

30:50.920 --> 30:52.920
But I love Justin and Travis

30:52.920 --> 30:54.920
I would really like it if you just randomly said

30:54.920 --> 30:56.920
Pick chicken rules

30:56.920 --> 30:58.920
Pick chicken rules

30:58.920 --> 31:00.920
Thanks oh yeah

31:00.920 --> 31:02.920
I also follow you guys on Facebook and Twitter

31:02.920 --> 31:04.920
And I'm dry as a popcorn

31:04.920 --> 31:06.920
Okay

31:06.920 --> 31:08.920
I imagine that says

31:08.920 --> 31:10.920
Popcorn fart

31:10.920 --> 31:12.920
But I can't be certain

31:12.920 --> 31:14.920
It's hard to say

31:14.920 --> 31:16.920
His 12 year old hotmail account

31:16.920 --> 31:18.920
Automatically censors that word

31:18.920 --> 31:20.920
Benjamin

31:20.920 --> 31:22.920
Pick chicken rules and thank you for listening

31:22.920 --> 31:24.920
Pick chicken doesn't fart

31:24.920 --> 31:26.920
Yahoo answers user

31:26.920 --> 31:28.920
Duke power hand

31:28.920 --> 31:30.920
What

31:30.920 --> 31:32.920
My whole day is about that name now

31:32.920 --> 31:34.920
What is it again

31:34.920 --> 31:36.920
Duke power hand

31:36.920 --> 31:38.920
Duke power hand

31:38.920 --> 31:40.920
That sounds like the greatest peripheral ever

31:40.920 --> 31:42.920
He asks

31:42.920 --> 31:44.920
Obama implements a

31:44.920 --> 31:46.920
White only tax?

31:46.920 --> 31:48.920
Uh

31:48.920 --> 31:50.920
He explains tanning beds

31:50.920 --> 31:52.920
Doesn't this tax fall disproportionately

31:52.920 --> 31:54.920
On Caucasians?

31:54.920 --> 31:56.920
Yeah so does the mayonnaise tax

31:56.920 --> 31:58.920
I don't think they flip it out

31:58.920 --> 32:00.920
This Kenny G tax

32:00.920 --> 32:02.920
Is killing me

32:02.920 --> 32:04.920
This is killing me

32:04.920 --> 32:06.920
I gotta tell you guys I was on Yahoo today

32:06.920 --> 32:08.920
And it was a hotbed

32:08.920 --> 32:10.920
Of political and religious discussion

32:10.920 --> 32:12.920
Was it?

32:12.920 --> 32:14.920
I can't like

32:14.920 --> 32:16.920
Just people going back and forth like

32:16.920 --> 32:18.920
God doesn't exist God totally exists

32:18.920 --> 32:20.920
Obama

32:20.920 --> 32:22.920
Is a Muslim

32:22.920 --> 32:24.920
And he's taxing whites

32:24.920 --> 32:26.920
Actually it's such

32:26.920 --> 32:28.920
It's you know

32:28.920 --> 32:30.920
People helping people

32:30.920 --> 32:32.920
That's the point of this website

32:32.920 --> 32:34.920
Today it was just

32:34.920 --> 32:36.920
I don't know it really brought me down

32:36.920 --> 32:38.920
People waging war on each other

32:38.920 --> 32:40.920
I can't say it enough

32:40.920 --> 32:42.920
When you want to have an important

32:42.920 --> 32:44.920
Political and religious discussion

32:44.920 --> 32:46.920
Yahoo answers

32:46.920 --> 32:48.920
Is the place to go

32:48.920 --> 32:50.920
Is the place to be

32:50.920 --> 32:52.920
Yeah it's a hotbed of learning

32:52.920 --> 32:54.920
Philosophical growing

32:54.920 --> 32:56.920
I graduated last year

32:56.920 --> 32:58.920
And I've been working for the past 10 months

32:58.920 --> 33:00.920
And saving most of the money

33:00.920 --> 33:02.920
This is from Jen's via Gmail

33:02.920 --> 33:04.920
I'm 20 years old and I've been planning to go traveling later this year

33:04.920 --> 33:06.920
Mostly in Asia

33:06.920 --> 33:08.920
My problem is that my friend I was going with

33:08.920 --> 33:10.920
Bailed and is going to start studying again

33:10.920 --> 33:12.920
That's what most people might soon be doing

33:12.920 --> 33:14.920
After getting anxiety for not doing shit and just staying at home

33:14.920 --> 33:16.920
Note to yourself Allen

33:16.920 --> 33:18.920
This is you in 5 years get your shit together

33:18.920 --> 33:20.920
So what do I do?

33:20.920 --> 33:22.920
Because all my other friends are either studying or just out of cash

33:22.920 --> 33:24.920
It's basically impossible to get one of them to come

33:24.920 --> 33:26.920
So I either go alone which is kind of scary

33:26.920 --> 33:28.920
And not as fun or I find some random person

33:28.920 --> 33:30.920
On the internet to join me which seems weird

33:30.920 --> 33:32.920
And you might get sick of him or her

33:32.920 --> 33:34.920
Pretty fast yeah it is weird

33:34.920 --> 33:36.920
You know what's scarier?

33:36.920 --> 33:38.920
A random person on the internet traveling with you

33:38.920 --> 33:40.920
Yeah I've never seen Hostel

33:40.920 --> 33:42.920
But this sounds like how that

33:42.920 --> 33:44.920
Movie plays out

33:44.920 --> 33:46.920
Imagine that moment you wake up in the train

33:46.920 --> 33:48.920
Car and they're just staring

33:48.920 --> 33:50.920
At you

33:50.920 --> 33:52.920
With your own eyes that they've pried out of your head

33:52.920 --> 33:54.920
You sleep so nicely

33:54.920 --> 33:56.920
I just love it

33:58.920 --> 34:00.920
Gents don't travel

34:00.920 --> 34:02.920
What? No

34:02.920 --> 34:04.920
Just don't travel

34:04.920 --> 34:06.920
Think of all the things you could spend

34:06.920 --> 34:08.920
That money on that you've saved up over the past 10 months

34:08.920 --> 34:10.920
That you could keep for longer than

34:10.920 --> 34:12.920
The duration of your travel

34:12.920 --> 34:14.920
No Griffin you know what never goes away?

34:14.920 --> 34:16.920
Memories

34:16.920 --> 34:18.920
I'm not taking off Ginkgo

34:18.920 --> 34:20.920
You can easily lose that shit

34:20.920 --> 34:22.920
And then it's like oh man I totally should have

34:22.920 --> 34:24.920
Spent that 2000 dollars

34:24.920 --> 34:26.920
On a scooter

34:26.920 --> 34:28.920
And then you die

34:28.920 --> 34:30.920
I just need a lifetime of buying Ginkgo

34:30.920 --> 34:32.920
And then pump it directly

34:32.920 --> 34:34.920
Into my brain

34:34.920 --> 34:36.920
So there you have it gents

34:36.920 --> 34:38.920
I guess

34:38.920 --> 34:40.920
My advice is travel by yourself

34:40.920 --> 34:42.920
It seems scary

34:42.920 --> 34:44.920
But think of it like a vision quest

34:44.920 --> 34:46.920
You know what I mean you'll get more out of it

34:46.920 --> 34:48.920
And you'll feel more

34:48.920 --> 34:50.920
Self assured and independent or

34:50.920 --> 34:52.920
You'll get knifed in an alley

34:52.920 --> 34:54.920
In Hong Kong

34:54.920 --> 34:56.920
At which point you learn something else about yourself

34:56.920 --> 34:58.920
And that is that you are vulnerable

34:58.920 --> 35:00.920
You could go on a real vision quest

35:00.920 --> 35:02.920
Just

35:02.920 --> 35:04.920
Go into the desert with some peyote

35:04.920 --> 35:06.920
And then

35:06.920 --> 35:08.920
It'll feel like you're traveling in Asia

35:08.920 --> 35:10.920
Because the sky around you will turn into

35:10.920 --> 35:12.920
Artwork from Asia albums

35:12.920 --> 35:14.920
Um

35:14.920 --> 35:16.920
Um

35:16.920 --> 35:18.920
You

35:18.920 --> 35:20.920
Yeah it's hard

35:20.920 --> 35:22.920
I would say maybe

35:22.920 --> 35:24.920
If you got this money socked away right

35:24.920 --> 35:26.920
Just um

35:26.920 --> 35:28.920
Just keep it socked away like you can

35:28.920 --> 35:30.920
Always just keep adding to it

35:30.920 --> 35:32.920
And soon you'll meet someone who

35:32.920 --> 35:34.920
Would be down to go with you

35:34.920 --> 35:36.920
I don't think going by yourself is a great idea

35:36.920 --> 35:38.920
First off you're going to need someone to talk

35:38.920 --> 35:40.920
To or you're going to go crazy with jungle madness

35:40.920 --> 35:42.920
Second you

35:42.920 --> 35:44.920
Want someone to be able to take pictures of you

35:44.920 --> 35:46.920
And or because without pictures

35:46.920 --> 35:48.920
It didn't happen

35:48.920 --> 35:50.920
Gosh this next email we're running along

35:50.920 --> 35:52.920
But this next email is so good

35:52.920 --> 35:54.920
Okay let me just read real quick

35:54.920 --> 35:56.920
I'm 16 from Vancouver Canada and my

35:56.920 --> 35:58.920
Grandmother moved in with my family a few months ago

35:58.920 --> 36:00.920
Recently she's been trying to connect

36:00.920 --> 36:02.920
With me which in her mind

36:02.920 --> 36:04.920
Means going out to buy gangsta clothes

36:04.920 --> 36:06.920
Baggy pants and lots of Ed Hardy

36:06.920 --> 36:08.920
Bling and lots of rap

36:08.920 --> 36:10.920
Music now she follows me around

36:10.920 --> 36:12.920
Asking what's up J-Dog

36:12.920 --> 36:14.920
And blasting 50 cent

36:14.920 --> 36:16.920
From our home speaker system

36:16.920 --> 36:18.920
At first it was easy to

36:18.920 --> 36:20.920
Ignore but now she's talking like

36:20.920 --> 36:22.920
This G-Ma thing as she calls

36:22.920 --> 36:24.920
It outside and even approaches

36:24.920 --> 36:26.920
My home dogs

36:26.920 --> 36:28.920
When we're at the mall and stuff

36:28.920 --> 36:30.920
What's even weirder about this whole situation

36:30.920 --> 36:32.920
Is that I'm more of an alternative guy

36:32.920 --> 36:34.920
Or even hipster myself

36:34.920 --> 36:36.920
So I have no idea

36:36.920 --> 36:38.920
Where she got this scheme from

36:38.920 --> 36:40.920
It's terrifying

36:40.920 --> 36:42.920
Help me I'm so confused

36:42.920 --> 36:44.920
As to what to do

36:44.920 --> 36:46.920
Should I mock her or something

36:46.920 --> 36:48.920
James from Gmail oh christ James

36:48.920 --> 36:50.920
I have to ask

36:50.920 --> 36:52.920
James would it be better if your Grandma was a huge hipster

36:52.920 --> 36:54.920
Like

36:54.920 --> 36:56.920
Dressed up in like one of those

36:56.920 --> 36:58.920
One piece tunics and it's like hey did you hear that new

36:58.920 --> 37:00.920
Animal Collective album?

37:00.920 --> 37:02.920
That sucks nothing's good anymore

37:02.920 --> 37:04.920
Well I think James' bigger problem is

37:04.920 --> 37:06.920
He's trapped in the Tyler Perry movie

37:06.920 --> 37:08.920
What

37:08.920 --> 37:10.920
Tyler Perry movie is that Travis can you come up with the name real quick?

37:10.920 --> 37:12.920
What's your favorite one?

37:12.920 --> 37:14.920
Madea but I haven't seen any

37:14.920 --> 37:16.920
I've never seen a Tyler Perry movie

37:16.920 --> 37:18.920
You choked

37:18.920 --> 37:20.920
There's Madea Goes to Jail or Madea's Family Reunion

37:20.920 --> 37:22.920
I think you just love

37:22.920 --> 37:24.920
I just think you just love

37:24.920 --> 37:26.920
You need to love your G-Ma

37:26.920 --> 37:28.920
Love her as much as you can I think that's fresh

37:28.920 --> 37:30.920
That she's putting in the effort

37:30.920 --> 37:32.920
I think you should encourage her to just be

37:32.920 --> 37:34.920
Yourself

37:34.920 --> 37:36.920
Unless she's a racist and a lot of people

37:36.920 --> 37:38.920
I hope people are

37:38.920 --> 37:40.920
So

37:40.920 --> 37:42.920
It's a tough call to make

37:42.920 --> 37:44.920
I say you cherish it because I think that's badass

37:44.920 --> 37:46.920
I think you cherish it because I think it's awesome

37:46.920 --> 37:48.920
I think you need to have interviews pictures taken

37:48.920 --> 37:50.920
With her she can be big on the net

37:50.920 --> 37:52.920
On the web maybe you need to turn her into

37:52.920 --> 37:54.920
An internet celebrity I think that's your first

37:54.920 --> 37:56.920
How about this my podcast

37:56.920 --> 37:58.920
G-Ma on me

37:58.920 --> 38:00.920
Oh my Jesus

38:00.920 --> 38:02.920
I'll put her on I'll take Griffin

38:02.920 --> 38:04.920
Off put her on

38:04.920 --> 38:06.920
I want to hear Griffin's last question

38:06.920 --> 38:08.920
But first

38:08.920 --> 38:10.920
I want to

38:10.920 --> 38:12.920
Well

38:12.920 --> 38:14.920
I want to read you an email first and then we'll get to the other stuff

38:14.920 --> 38:16.920
We got this email from our buddy Tristan

38:16.920 --> 38:18.920
The Marine

38:18.920 --> 38:20.920
And it's a little long

38:20.920 --> 38:22.920
But Tristan's a real close friend of the show so I

38:22.920 --> 38:24.920
Want to read it he says

38:24.920 --> 38:26.920
Hey brothers McElroy

38:26.920 --> 38:28.920
And hello to all you amazing good looking

38:28.920 --> 38:30.920
Listeners Tristan The Marine here

38:30.920 --> 38:32.920
I'm writing this email with a heavy heart and a frown on my face

38:32.920 --> 38:34.920
Because it pains me to say the following the next

38:34.920 --> 38:36.920
MB&B AM will be the last episode of

38:36.920 --> 38:38.920
McElroy goodness I will get to listen to for three long

38:38.920 --> 38:40.920
Months see I'm leaving for boot camp at

38:40.920 --> 38:42.920
Recruit Training Depot Paris Island

38:42.920 --> 38:44.920
August 8th other than occasional

38:44.920 --> 38:46.920
Letters I will have no contact with the outside world

38:46.920 --> 38:48.920
For 13 weeks I wanted to

38:48.920 --> 38:50.920
Write to tell the three of you and again

38:50.920 --> 38:52.920
Those of you listening

38:52.920 --> 38:54.920
That what an encouragement you've been to me

38:54.920 --> 38:56.920
And how much joy you brought in my life

38:56.920 --> 38:58.920
In the time since MB&B AM launched

38:58.920 --> 39:00.920
I've had a wild ride getting ready to go to boot camp

39:00.920 --> 39:02.920
While I will never doubt my commitment to serving my

39:02.920 --> 39:04.920
Country and protecting our precious freedoms

39:04.920 --> 39:06.920
There have been times when the light at the end of the tunnel was very very dim

39:06.920 --> 39:08.920
Over the last

39:08.920 --> 39:10.920
I'm going to skip ahead a little bit

39:10.920 --> 39:12.920
Over the last few months MB&B AM has reminded

39:12.920 --> 39:14.920
Me what I'm joining for I'm joining for the people

39:14.920 --> 39:16.920
Of this nation like Justin Griffin and Travis and all the

39:16.920 --> 39:18.920
Listeners who care more about quality of life

39:18.920 --> 39:20.920
For other people than themselves

39:20.920 --> 39:22.920
The people who are always willing to tell you straight up that you need

39:22.920 --> 39:24.920
To pack your shit and get the hell out of your situation

39:24.920 --> 39:26.920
Because it is the only way

39:26.920 --> 39:28.920
I'm proud to serve my country and even more proud

39:28.920 --> 39:30.920
To know that I'm serving for amazing people like you

39:30.920 --> 39:32.920
Again thank you from the bottom of my heart

39:32.920 --> 39:34.920
Now seriously pack up your bags

39:34.920 --> 39:36.920
No one wants you around with all the pride and

39:36.920 --> 39:38.920
Gratitude Tristan the Marine

39:38.920 --> 39:40.920
And he gives a special

39:40.920 --> 39:42.920
Shout out to Bob Ball

39:42.920 --> 39:44.920
For the encouragement and all the listeners for

39:44.920 --> 39:46.920
Encouraging him and he says

39:46.920 --> 39:48.920
So

39:48.920 --> 39:50.920
Tristan

39:50.920 --> 39:52.920
Much much much love

39:52.920 --> 39:54.920
Safety continued safety

39:54.920 --> 39:56.920
And I hope

39:56.920 --> 39:58.920
That once you get a taste of

39:58.920 --> 40:00.920
Killing you're still able to find

40:00.920 --> 40:02.920
Humor in situations like our podcast

40:04.920 --> 40:06.920
And you don't turn into a murder automaton

40:08.920 --> 40:10.920
Though that is a distinct possibility

40:10.920 --> 40:12.920
So thanks

40:12.920 --> 40:14.920
So thanks but

40:14.920 --> 40:16.920
Always make sure you murder for America

40:16.920 --> 40:18.920
Not against America

40:18.920 --> 40:20.920
That is so key

40:20.920 --> 40:22.920
So important you cannot

40:22.920 --> 40:24.920
Enforce that enough so we love you Tristan come back soon

40:24.920 --> 40:26.920
Good luck Tristan

40:26.920 --> 40:28.920
Get me an ear

40:28.920 --> 40:30.920
I don't know a lot about the military

40:30.920 --> 40:32.920
I think boot camp is pretty sick

40:32.920 --> 40:34.920
I still want him to bring me an ear

40:34.920 --> 40:36.920
Bring me a necklace

40:36.920 --> 40:38.920
Of ears

40:38.920 --> 40:40.920
Tristan I want a necklace of ears

40:40.920 --> 40:42.920
Carved from your enemies

40:42.920 --> 40:44.920
I don't care who they come from

40:44.920 --> 40:46.920
Yeah

40:46.920 --> 40:48.920
I do

40:48.920 --> 40:50.920
I want you to be the people who

40:50.920 --> 40:52.920
Say ill words about our show

40:52.920 --> 40:54.920
Make sure you play it for them

40:54.920 --> 40:56.920
On a boombox held over your head outside

40:56.920 --> 40:58.920
So I want to hear Griffin's last question

40:58.920 --> 41:00.920
A couple quick notes

41:00.920 --> 41:02.920
Today is the last day

41:02.920 --> 41:04.920
You can pre-order a t-shirt

41:04.920 --> 41:06.920
For my brother my brother and me

41:06.920 --> 41:08.920
After that after today

41:08.920 --> 41:10.920
You may be able to order them

41:10.920 --> 41:12.920
We have no idea of how many are going to get

41:12.920 --> 41:14.920
Made

41:14.920 --> 41:16.920
Other than our pre-orders

41:16.920 --> 41:18.920
If you want to guarantee yourself one in the size and style

41:18.920 --> 41:20.920
That you would prefer

41:20.920 --> 41:22.920

41:30.920 --> 41:32.920
Don't contemplate don't debate

41:32.920 --> 41:34.920
Just do it

41:34.920 --> 41:36.920
Don't masturbate well just not to

41:36.920 --> 41:38.920

41:48.920 --> 41:50.920
We have a little bit of bonus content

41:50.920 --> 41:52.920
Maybe we should put that rap

41:52.920 --> 41:54.920
That rap tune on there

41:54.920 --> 41:56.920
That rap tune

41:56.920 --> 41:58.920

42:12.920 --> 42:14.920
And thank you to Maximum

42:14.920 --> 42:16.920
Fun for that really awesome review

42:16.920 --> 42:18.920
Thanks to everybody who bought

42:18.920 --> 42:20.920
T-shirts and the app

42:20.920 --> 42:22.920
It's really nice

42:22.920 --> 42:24.920
We'll promise to spend the

42:24.920 --> 42:26.920
Money on microphones and stuff

42:26.920 --> 42:28.920
Just a little bit of blow

42:28.920 --> 42:30.920
Just a

42:30.920 --> 42:32.920
Not an excessive

42:32.920 --> 42:34.920
Amount of blow but just

42:34.920 --> 42:36.920
I just want a pile of it on my desk

42:36.920 --> 42:38.920
I don't think anything

42:38.920 --> 42:40.920
Is going to make the show

42:40.920 --> 42:42.920
Better

42:42.920 --> 42:44.920
More better than a quick pregame

42:44.920 --> 42:46.920
Bump before each episode

42:46.920 --> 42:48.920
Maybe just a bumpette

42:48.920 --> 42:50.920
Just a little bump

42:50.920 --> 42:52.920
Just a little

42:52.920 --> 42:54.920
Snoot

42:54.920 --> 42:56.920
Griffin

42:56.920 --> 42:58.920
What is our last question?

42:58.920 --> 43:00.920
I'll be honest I've got like three

43:00.920 --> 43:02.920
I'm just going to have to

43:02.920 --> 43:04.920
Think about this Griffin

43:04.920 --> 43:06.920
This is Tristan's last episode of My Brother My Brother Me

43:06.920 --> 43:08.920
For months

43:08.920 --> 43:10.920
You've got to

43:10.920 --> 43:38.920
Nail it

43:38.920 --> 43:40.920
I'm Justin McElroy

43:40.920 --> 43:42.920
Travis McElroy

43:42.920 --> 43:44.920
I'm Griffin McElroy

43:44.920 --> 43:46.920
This has been

43:46.920 --> 43:48.920
My Brother My Brother Me

43:48.920 --> 43:50.920
You will never know me

43:50.920 --> 44:08.920
Because your dad's square on the lips

44:08.920 --> 44:24.920
Music
