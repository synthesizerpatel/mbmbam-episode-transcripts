WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:51.680
Guess who's back? Back again. JC's back. Tell a friend.

00:51.680 --> 00:58.400
That's right, folks. Our main man JC stone rolled away. What's up? What's up now?

00:58.400 --> 01:02.880
Said it couldn't be done. Sorry, haters. I thought you were talking about the second

01:02.880 --> 01:08.560
coming of JC ChazÃ©, whose career has hit a major updraft lately.

01:08.560 --> 01:12.960
I say updraft. That updraft is the perfect word. He's gliding on his success, I think.

01:14.560 --> 01:19.200
He's on a hang glider of success. So this is our special Easter edition. The

01:19.200 --> 01:27.040
stone of ignorance has been rolled away. There in its place is us. My name is Justin McElroy.

01:27.040 --> 01:29.680
I'm Travis McElroy. I'm Griffin McElroy.

01:31.200 --> 01:33.680
We are still alive, but we're sleeping in there.

01:33.680 --> 01:38.240
Can I say something? I don't want to offend anyone, so I can't stress enough how much this

01:38.240 --> 01:43.920
next statement has no religious connotations whatsoever. But of all the holidays that you

01:43.920 --> 01:49.040
really look forward to as a kid, Easter is the only one that doesn't translate to adulthood.

01:50.160 --> 01:52.880
You think? There's no baskets when you're an adult.

01:52.880 --> 01:57.280
Okay, so when you're a kid, you celebrate Christmas, then you're an adult, and of course,

01:57.280 --> 02:01.040
Christmas rules. And then you get Halloween, and then you get to be an adult, and you get to

02:01.040 --> 02:04.000
drink and dress up. Yeah, Halloween gets better, I would say.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.840
Halloween does get better. And like St. Patrick's Day just gets way

02:07.840 --> 02:10.640
more awesome when you get older. Why do you even have St. Patrick's Day

02:10.640 --> 02:14.320
if you're a kid? What are you doing? Putting food on your milk? Fuck you.

02:14.320 --> 02:19.840
But then Easter, what's the adult equivalent of an Easter basket?

02:19.840 --> 02:26.480
Well, most people see when they reach adulthood, they're so scared of dying, is the thing. So this

02:26.480 --> 02:30.640
day is super wicked, because it means you get to live forever, I guess.

02:30.640 --> 02:33.840
What about jello eggs? Ain't nothing wrong with that.

02:35.520 --> 02:38.000
What about donut eggs, man? You guys get those here?

02:38.000 --> 02:40.480
Cake eggs. Fake eggs?

02:40.480 --> 02:44.880
Cake, cake, cake. Fake eggs are baller, because it's like-

02:44.880 --> 02:49.840
I like rake eggs, which they're eggs, and they're so big you have to eat them with a rake.

02:49.840 --> 02:54.240
These are delicious. This is My Brother, My Brother Meets An Advice Show for the modern era.

02:55.600 --> 02:57.760
Did we cover our names yet? I think we already did that.

02:58.560 --> 03:03.360
Thank you again to everyone who came out to see us perform live in Chicago.

03:05.520 --> 03:06.960
On my birthday. On his birthday.

03:06.960 --> 03:12.560
Our next live show is in the works. No details yet, but we're-

03:12.560 --> 03:17.360
You can always come see my one-man show at the Chuggle Hut, Fake in the Funk.

03:17.920 --> 03:20.000
Fake in the Funk, starring Travis Macklemore.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.080
We can say where our live show will not be.

03:23.280 --> 03:23.920
Okay.

03:23.920 --> 03:26.880
Like, West Coast? Sorry, guys.

03:26.880 --> 03:28.800
Sorry, guys. Eventually, we'll get there.

03:28.800 --> 03:29.280
We know that there's a-

03:29.280 --> 03:32.240
Until we set up a Brother franchise out in the West Coast.

03:32.240 --> 03:38.720
Yeah. We're like rallies. We're sure there's a ton of people who- Actually, I'm sure, because

03:38.720 --> 03:42.720
I see that info on our statistics page, that we have a lot of listeners in California.

03:42.720 --> 03:43.040
It's a beautiful state.

03:43.040 --> 03:46.000
We will get out there. Griffin and I will be out there in June.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.640
We just can't get Travis out there. Well, okay.

03:48.640 --> 03:52.640
We will get out there eventually. That's my promise to the West Coast.

03:52.640 --> 03:57.520
This nation is so goddamn gigantic. Too big for its own good.

03:57.520 --> 03:59.040
Yeah. Too big to fail.

03:59.040 --> 04:05.120
If we could just get rid of the breadbasket, we might be able to get over westward.

04:05.120 --> 04:08.080
But can't do it now because of the breadbasket.

04:08.080 --> 04:10.800
Yeah. Sorry, basket.

04:12.240 --> 04:14.080
So, let's get into the questions.

04:14.880 --> 04:16.880
We did need to talk about something else, though.

04:16.880 --> 04:17.440
Oh, my God.

04:18.240 --> 04:19.520
Griffin, what happened?

04:19.520 --> 04:21.440
About my fucking psychic abilities?

04:21.440 --> 04:24.560
Yeah. About your ability to prognosticate into the future.

04:24.560 --> 04:28.800
I need to stop making jokes because, apparently, my jokes are future truths,

04:29.680 --> 04:33.200
and I don't want to cause the end of the world with a future truth.

04:33.200 --> 04:33.440
Right.

04:33.440 --> 04:37.920
Right. People sent me this link a lot this past week.

04:37.920 --> 04:40.720
This is from ESPN, which is like my favorite website.

04:43.040 --> 04:44.480
Here's the headline. You ready?

04:45.360 --> 04:47.520
Philly Bot to Crank Out First Pitch.

04:49.200 --> 04:50.000
Yes, that's right.

04:51.120 --> 04:54.480
The University of Pennsylvania has crafted a one-armed,

04:54.480 --> 04:58.960
three-wheeled robot that threw out the opening pitch before Wednesday's game

04:58.960 --> 05:02.800
between the Phillies and the Brewers at Philly Diamond.

05:02.800 --> 05:03.760
That's what they call it.

05:03.760 --> 05:04.640
A robot.

05:04.640 --> 05:06.640
A motherfucking robot.

05:06.640 --> 05:09.360
They spent so much time thinking about if they could.

05:09.360 --> 05:11.200
They didn't stop to think about if they should.

05:12.800 --> 05:14.320
Or if they could.

05:15.840 --> 05:16.560
Did it not work?

05:16.560 --> 05:17.120
No, I guess they did.

05:17.120 --> 05:19.760
They thought about that pretty hard because they did it.

05:20.560 --> 05:23.840
The ball appeared to be traveling no more than 30 or 40 miles an hour.

05:23.840 --> 05:25.200
Do you know what this sounds like to me?

05:25.200 --> 05:26.240
This sounds like a beard.

05:26.240 --> 05:27.920
It sounds to me like they're trying to throw off a

05:27.920 --> 05:29.600
everyone's scent.

05:29.600 --> 05:31.920
Like, oh, look, we made a little wacky robot.

05:31.920 --> 05:33.360
We put a pinwheel on him.

05:33.360 --> 05:34.560
Isn't he harmless?

05:34.560 --> 05:38.320
Meanwhile, in their fucking bullpen, they got Roy Halladay.

05:38.320 --> 05:42.080
They got Cliff Lee, who are human-shaped robots who can pitch a ball

05:42.640 --> 05:45.680
fast enough to just throw it through a car.

05:45.680 --> 05:47.520
The robot's trying to throw this off.

05:47.520 --> 05:48.720
It's the old rope-a-dope.

05:48.720 --> 05:50.320
The robo-dope.

05:50.320 --> 05:51.200
The robo-dope.

05:51.200 --> 05:53.600
And he's saying, you actually heard him.

05:53.600 --> 05:57.280
They said he doesn't have speech circuits, but he actually said after he threw it,

05:57.280 --> 05:59.040
oh, that's as hard as I can.

05:59.840 --> 06:00.720
He said that.

06:00.720 --> 06:02.400
I'm just a robot.

06:02.400 --> 06:03.760
I'm just a robot.

06:04.400 --> 06:06.960
There was a press conference afterwards and a reporter stood up.

06:06.960 --> 06:11.280
He's like, I heard Cole Hamels has bionic legs and arms and they shot him.

06:11.280 --> 06:12.720
They killed him on the spot.

06:12.720 --> 06:17.200
The robot threw, yeah, 30, 40 doesn't sound that bad until it's a robot that's eight feet away

06:17.200 --> 06:18.480
and it wants to eat your brain.

06:19.600 --> 06:20.880
So let's get right to the questions.

06:21.440 --> 06:25.280
How do I get my roommate to stop chewing with his fucking mouth open?

06:25.280 --> 06:30.080
Whenever he eats something, I can hear his disgusting mouth noises from across the room.

06:30.080 --> 06:33.280
I've told him multiple times it makes you want to vomit, but he still does it.

06:33.280 --> 06:35.040
What a fucking cow.

06:35.040 --> 06:36.080
Furious as fuck.

06:36.080 --> 06:38.480
I hope he was typing this like as his roommate watched.

06:38.480 --> 06:41.600
Is he alright looking over his shoulder?

06:43.600 --> 06:47.120
You could do what Justin used to do whenever I chewed with my mouth open and just stand

06:47.120 --> 06:51.120
across the room going, nah, nah, nah, nah.

06:51.120 --> 06:52.080
Did it work?

06:52.080 --> 06:52.880
Yeah, it worked.

06:52.880 --> 06:53.440
Yeah, it worked.

06:53.440 --> 06:56.640
Guys, I don't want to, this may not be the best time to get into this.

06:57.520 --> 06:58.240
Why?

06:58.240 --> 07:03.440
You both have bad mouth chewing policies and practices.

07:03.440 --> 07:04.960
You both chew poorly.

07:04.960 --> 07:06.960
Well, I don't take dainty bites.

07:06.960 --> 07:10.880
Travis takes, Travis is like in a race.

07:10.880 --> 07:15.840
Travis is trying to figure out how few bites he can use to consume because Travis is all

07:15.840 --> 07:20.720
about energy conservation and chewing burns those precious calories that he's gaining

07:20.720 --> 07:22.240
from eating his pizza bagels.

07:22.240 --> 07:27.200
My friend in Trevor in college said I eat like I look like someone's about to take

07:27.200 --> 07:28.160
my food away from me.

07:29.440 --> 07:30.160
You do.

07:30.160 --> 07:34.960
It's some sort of post-apocalyptic future and you've just found this can of gravy.

07:34.960 --> 07:37.040
God forbid anyone tries to move my bowl.

07:37.040 --> 07:38.560
I will take your hand off.

07:38.560 --> 07:39.600
Yeah, he's brutal.

07:41.760 --> 07:50.320
Well, it's hard because it sounds like a pretty good little ploy you used on there

07:50.320 --> 07:52.000
telling him that makes you want to throw up.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.800
Yeah, I think you've tried the direct approach.

07:54.800 --> 07:59.440
Maybe maybe start stealing all the food in the house so he didn't have any food and

07:59.440 --> 08:00.480
then he has to eat somewhere else.

08:00.480 --> 08:01.440
What about that?

08:01.440 --> 08:06.400
I'm going to say you give him the sliced alone treatment and you go right over the

08:06.400 --> 08:06.900
top.

08:08.320 --> 08:13.120
You smack and you jaw as loudly as you possibly can.

08:13.680 --> 08:19.120
Every single thing that you eat, like if you could work moans into it like

08:19.120 --> 08:25.680
like you're getting some sort of like pseudo sexual satisfaction from that taco.

08:26.960 --> 08:28.960
I've eaten some pretty good tacos before, actually.

08:29.520 --> 08:35.200
This might just be wishful thinking and like really optimistic, but I think that the problem

08:35.200 --> 08:38.080
is is that people can't hear their own mouth sounds like.

08:38.640 --> 08:39.600
Yeah, they can.

08:39.600 --> 08:39.840
Sure.

08:39.840 --> 08:43.200
I think that people can listen to themselves chew and they're like, that's not so bad.

08:43.200 --> 08:48.000
I think when you eat a good meal, you get all your senses into it.

08:48.000 --> 08:51.520
You want to touch it, you want to taste it, you want to smell it, you want to see it and

08:51.520 --> 08:52.800
you want to hear it.

08:52.800 --> 08:56.400
And you really want to add to that satisfaction by like letting yourself know that you're

08:56.400 --> 08:57.840
doing a good job eating.

08:57.840 --> 09:00.640
And that's the thing you're eating is making your mouth feel good.

09:01.280 --> 09:02.880
That's why I'm saying moan it up.

09:02.880 --> 09:09.280
Like, by the way, if if I ever if I ever say, hey, what's up with all the eating noises

09:09.280 --> 09:14.640
and you go to tell me that it's considered high praise in some countries, you better

09:14.640 --> 09:16.560
fucking have a plane ticket in your pocket.

09:16.560 --> 09:20.400
That's that's because otherwise you'll make them move away.

09:22.800 --> 09:26.720
They better be flying to a place where it's acceptable, like they better be in practice,

09:26.720 --> 09:34.800
like in training, trying to get ready to eat like a like a caveman or just tell him to

09:34.800 --> 09:39.280
he's only allowed to eat in secret spaces like he has to go into his room.

09:39.280 --> 09:42.000
He can't eat in shared spaces anymore.

09:42.000 --> 09:46.320
Who is this a thing referring to your bedroom as your secret space?

09:46.320 --> 09:49.680
Is this a thing that didn't catch on here?

09:49.680 --> 09:53.840
I guess, you know, I said that out loud and I go to your secret space, Daryl.

09:55.440 --> 09:58.960
Well, you should just be happy that he does make chewing sounds.

09:58.960 --> 10:00.320
Because what if he didn't have a mouth?

10:01.040 --> 10:02.160
Then you'd feel bad.

10:02.160 --> 10:03.200
What if you were deaf?

10:03.200 --> 10:05.120
What if you were deaf and you couldn't hear any sounds?

10:06.560 --> 10:07.360
Celebrate.

10:07.360 --> 10:08.880
Maybe count your blessings.

10:08.880 --> 10:09.680
Griffin.

10:09.680 --> 10:10.240
What?

10:10.240 --> 10:11.280
You know what I need.

10:11.280 --> 10:12.720
I do.

10:12.720 --> 10:14.800
Um, how about this?

10:14.800 --> 10:17.680
This one was sent in by Galia Ali.

10:17.680 --> 10:19.360
Thanks, sir ma'am.

10:20.080 --> 10:22.000
It's by Yahoo Answers user Big Jeff.

10:22.800 --> 10:23.600
Big Jeff.

10:23.600 --> 10:28.000
Big Jeff asks wrestling themed wedding.

10:29.360 --> 10:31.520
I want to get married in a wrestling ring.

10:31.520 --> 10:32.960
I've got plenty of money to spend.

10:32.960 --> 10:34.960
My dad won the lottery in 2008.

10:35.520 --> 10:38.320
My girlfriend doesn't even like wrestling, but I do.

10:38.320 --> 10:40.320
And I want to get married in a wrestling ring.

10:40.320 --> 10:44.480
And then I want Brock Lesnar to come in and beat the shit out everybody.

10:44.480 --> 10:45.760
You know, like he does.

10:47.600 --> 10:50.320
And I want him to F5 my obese aunt.

10:52.720 --> 10:59.840
I don't want a man to attack my new wife, so I want Kelly Kelly to come out and F you

10:59.840 --> 11:04.560
my girlfriend, which would be hot because my girlfriend is a little bigger than Kelly Kelly.

11:05.440 --> 11:10.080
Yeah, I bet, judging from this question, I bet she's a little bigger, I think.

11:10.080 --> 11:12.960
I've only told my girlfriend I want to get married in a wrestling ring,

11:12.960 --> 11:14.000
and she hates it.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.600
Frowny face emoticon.

11:17.600 --> 11:19.440
So you say, hey, do you want to get married wrestling?

11:20.080 --> 11:20.800
No, I don't.

11:20.800 --> 11:22.240
OK, well, what about this?

11:22.240 --> 11:24.080
What if I consult the internet?

11:24.080 --> 11:25.600
Let me pay you a picture.

11:25.600 --> 11:28.480
I'm going to move forward as though you said yes.

11:28.480 --> 11:29.600
I've got a loose outline.

11:31.120 --> 11:32.480
It involves Kelly Kelly.

11:33.360 --> 11:34.880
You know your mom's sister?

11:34.880 --> 11:36.080
She's a little overweight.

11:36.080 --> 11:38.000
We're going to get Brock Lesnar to F5 her.

11:38.000 --> 11:42.080
We're going to get Brock Lesnar to furiously try to reload your aunt.

11:42.080 --> 11:43.520
You know what's great?

11:43.520 --> 11:48.880
Because I don't know who any of these people are, he might as well be saying, like, completely

11:48.880 --> 11:50.720
made up mythological names.

11:50.720 --> 11:53.040
To me, it's just completely insane.

11:53.040 --> 11:57.680
If Kelly Kelly is a real person who's become famous for professional wrestling, I'm going

11:57.680 --> 11:58.720
to go hang myself.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.400
What happened to Griffin Kelly Kelly?

12:02.400 --> 12:02.960
Kelly Kelly.

12:02.960 --> 12:04.400
He saw Kelly Kelly and hung himself.

12:04.400 --> 12:05.840
Man, this is a...

12:05.840 --> 12:09.680
This is a... did you go to did you go to Big Jeff's wedding?

12:09.680 --> 12:15.600
Yeah, it was pretty good until the Brock Lesnar came out and beat the shit out of everybody.

12:16.240 --> 12:16.800
Who was that?

12:16.800 --> 12:17.760
Is that a real person?

12:17.760 --> 12:18.560
Yeah, I think so.

12:18.560 --> 12:19.680
I think it apparently is.

12:19.680 --> 12:23.200
It was like 50 to one and he whooped everyone's ass.

12:23.200 --> 12:24.320
You know, like he does.

12:24.320 --> 12:25.120
Like he does.

12:25.120 --> 12:25.680
Like he does.

12:25.680 --> 12:26.880
That's Brock Lesnar for you.

12:27.520 --> 12:29.280
They put the cake at the top of a ladder.

12:29.280 --> 12:30.480
They had a ladder match.

12:30.480 --> 12:31.840
A ladder match for the cake.

12:31.840 --> 12:33.040
Yeah, of course.

12:33.040 --> 12:36.880
Although that obese aunt, that fat mom's sister, she got right in there.

12:37.680 --> 12:38.960
After she got reloaded.

12:38.960 --> 12:43.600
In case anyone is wondering, I imagine that it's like when you see a stand up comic in

12:43.600 --> 12:45.760
like everyday life and you're like, be funny.

12:45.760 --> 12:48.560
I bet going into a wrestler and be like, punch me.

12:48.560 --> 12:50.720
He's like, oh, man, I'm off the clock.

12:50.720 --> 12:52.880
I don't I don't want to punch just.

12:53.600 --> 13:00.480
Yeah, but presumably if if this Lesnar person is making an appearance at your show, individual,

13:00.480 --> 13:04.720
he's been compensated richly for the the act of beating.

13:04.720 --> 13:07.200
He's about to deliver to everyone like he does.

13:07.200 --> 13:08.960
Is that what wrestling fans are really like?

13:09.840 --> 13:10.560
Are they really like?

13:11.840 --> 13:17.120
OK, if I if I was a big wrestling fan and I met the rock and the rock beat the shit out of me,

13:17.120 --> 13:18.480
I don't think I'd be a wrestling fan.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.400
I think I'd be a litigant.

13:22.400 --> 13:24.640
Actually, I think I would maybe find like another hobby.

13:24.640 --> 13:32.240
Yeah, I don't I don't think that that would continue to be one of my real passions wrestling.

13:32.240 --> 13:34.160
It really caught fire after.

13:36.480 --> 13:39.760
Jake Snig Roberts kicked me in the crotch and threw me down a well.

13:41.360 --> 13:42.480
How was Big Joe sweating?

13:42.480 --> 13:46.480
It was OK instead of handing out rice to throw, they handed out folding chairs.

13:48.160 --> 13:52.720
Booker T killed both of them with a folding chair, so probably not the best wedding.

13:52.720 --> 13:53.920
So they're dead now.

13:53.920 --> 13:55.840
Yeah, I got my Cuisinart back.

13:56.560 --> 13:59.040
And I got to shake hands with Jimmy Superfly Snooka.

14:00.080 --> 14:01.440
It's pretty good, I guess.

14:01.440 --> 14:02.800
Pretty good wedding overall.

14:02.800 --> 14:04.000
It was a pretty good wedding.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.560
Ray Mysterio officiated.

14:07.120 --> 14:10.240
Oh, I swear that was Hacksaw Jim Duggan.

14:10.240 --> 14:12.960
Damn it, I was trying to come up with the Hacksaw Jim Duggan joke.

14:13.920 --> 14:16.480
You should have been like me and not come up with one to say his name

14:17.280 --> 14:18.560
in some sort of context.

14:18.560 --> 14:19.280
Undertaker.

14:21.280 --> 14:22.080
What are we doing?

14:22.080 --> 14:24.320
Yeah, do you want my Paul Bearer impersonation?

14:26.080 --> 14:27.200
Say yes.

14:29.520 --> 14:30.400
I do.

14:34.560 --> 14:34.960
You know what?

14:34.960 --> 14:36.320
I'm just assuming he's Christian.

14:36.320 --> 14:38.320
These could be Jewish services, too.

14:40.160 --> 14:43.760
They could smash a commemorative plastic cup at the end.

14:44.720 --> 14:48.800
They could hoist Big Jeff up on a chair and then pull it out from under him and hit him with it.

14:48.800 --> 14:51.680
I'll take it back.

14:51.680 --> 14:53.280
This sounds like a pretty good wedding.

14:53.280 --> 14:55.840
I think Jeff's wife is being kind of a bitch.

14:55.840 --> 14:57.600
This sounds awesome.

14:58.560 --> 15:01.120
Oh man, it would make the processionals way cooler.

15:02.640 --> 15:03.280
Oh my god.

15:03.840 --> 15:04.480
Yeah.

15:04.480 --> 15:05.440
Instead of here comes the bride.

15:05.440 --> 15:08.400
You walk in your own fucking theme music and jump over the ropes?

15:08.400 --> 15:09.760
Yeah, it was so romantic.

15:09.760 --> 15:11.600
She walked down the aisle to Crazy Train.

15:13.200 --> 15:14.560
There were fireworks and shit.

15:14.560 --> 15:15.280
That's pretty cool.

15:15.840 --> 15:16.720
I think that this-

15:16.720 --> 15:24.240
Big Jeff, I usually don't try to get into these things.

15:24.240 --> 15:29.600
I don't get into these sorts of conflicts, but I think your wife is wrong on this one.

15:30.240 --> 15:30.880
I think you're right.

15:32.320 --> 15:37.120
Although it would suck if he showed up and they tried to pull the Montreal screw job on him

15:37.120 --> 15:38.480
and he had to marry somebody else.

15:40.800 --> 15:41.440
That's deep.

15:41.440 --> 15:42.240
That's a deep cut.

15:42.240 --> 15:44.240
There's one wrestling fan out there who just laughed.

15:45.280 --> 15:45.840
Trust me.

15:45.840 --> 15:47.840
He is in stitches.

15:48.480 --> 15:50.320
Hey, I'm getting married later this year.

15:50.320 --> 15:50.640
Wow.

15:51.520 --> 15:55.360
I just found out that not one, but possibly two of my groomsmen

15:55.360 --> 15:57.040
may not be able to make it to my wedding.

15:57.760 --> 16:02.320
They're both in the Navy, so their schedule is dictated by our commander in chief.

16:02.320 --> 16:03.040
What do I do?

16:03.680 --> 16:06.320
Should I find a couple of second stringers, take their place?

16:06.320 --> 16:09.840
Or should I make two of my other groomsmen walk down with two stinky,

16:09.840 --> 16:11.440
possibly cootie infested girls?

16:11.440 --> 16:12.320
Rich from Seattle.

16:12.320 --> 16:13.920
Ooh, whatever you do.

16:13.920 --> 16:17.840
You don't tell the replacement that they're second stringers.

16:18.560 --> 16:19.040
Yeah.

16:19.040 --> 16:21.680
Yeah, that's not a good framing for it.

16:22.640 --> 16:26.160
Although they probably know that they're not as good as two dudes who are in the Navy.

16:26.960 --> 16:28.160
Yeah, that's true.

16:28.160 --> 16:30.160
Navy men, naval officers.

16:31.280 --> 16:32.400
I hate to hear this.

16:32.400 --> 16:36.800
That's a tough one because you want it to be those people.

16:36.800 --> 16:38.160
I mean, I'm sure they'd understand.

16:38.800 --> 16:39.040
Yeah.

16:39.040 --> 16:44.400
You gotta have a sit down with that commander in chief.

16:44.400 --> 16:45.680
Yeah, what up Obama?

16:45.680 --> 16:49.200
You gotta go talk to Barry and you gotta figure it out.

16:49.200 --> 16:51.200
Say, listen, let's bend these schedules.

16:51.200 --> 16:52.880
Hey, quick, let's jaw for a second.

16:53.440 --> 16:56.800
Hey, hey, give me some of these jelly beans.

16:56.800 --> 16:58.320
Barry, I know you're busy.

16:58.320 --> 17:00.640
Barry, so help me work this out for a sec.

17:00.640 --> 17:01.520
What is he asking here?

17:01.520 --> 17:10.320
I think what he's really asking is, is it acceptable to have backups?

17:11.280 --> 17:14.720
Is it acceptable to have, what's the theater term?

17:15.760 --> 17:16.960
Understudies.

17:16.960 --> 17:20.240
Yeah, can you have that for a wedding?

17:20.240 --> 17:23.840
I don't understand though, he says, should he find second stringers to take to places

17:23.840 --> 17:28.080
or should I make two of my other groomsmen walk down with two stinky,

17:28.080 --> 17:29.440
possibly cootie invested girls?

17:29.440 --> 17:30.640
I'm not sure I understand.

17:30.640 --> 17:34.160
When I think he's asking, do you have someone double up

17:34.160 --> 17:39.440
and like one bridesmaid with two bridesmaids on the other side?

17:39.440 --> 17:39.680
Okay.

17:39.680 --> 17:40.480
Nice.

17:40.480 --> 17:40.800
Whoa.

17:41.360 --> 17:41.680
Yeah.

17:41.680 --> 17:42.560
That's a pretty tip.

17:42.560 --> 17:44.160
When you do that, you're no longer a groomsman.

17:44.160 --> 17:45.680
You're a coxsman.

17:47.040 --> 17:49.600
The problem is, it's like, who's this ladies man?

17:49.600 --> 17:52.800
If you don't get second stringers, if you don't get understudies,

17:52.800 --> 17:57.120
your side is gonna be out of balance from your bride side.

17:57.120 --> 17:58.000
Yeah, that's true.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.240
And your bride is not gonna like that.

18:00.240 --> 18:00.800
Yeah.

18:00.800 --> 18:01.200
Whoa.

18:01.200 --> 18:05.040
Hey, speaking witch dog, why are you asking us?

18:05.040 --> 18:06.960
You are not making this decision, sir.

18:06.960 --> 18:07.680
Yeah.

18:07.680 --> 18:08.560
Sorry, friend.

18:08.560 --> 18:10.880
You can have all the opinions you want about this.

18:10.880 --> 18:12.080
This is not up to you.

18:13.040 --> 18:14.320
You know what you could do?

18:14.320 --> 18:14.880
What?

18:14.880 --> 18:15.760
Wrestling wedding.

18:15.760 --> 18:18.240
And then it wouldn't matter if it was unbalanced,

18:18.240 --> 18:20.640
because you could have a fucking royal rumple.

18:20.640 --> 18:24.400
And you would think, oh, you would think like the two friends in the Navy,

18:24.400 --> 18:28.400
they're out of town, but then they totally come in with their work and tag in

18:28.400 --> 18:31.040
and then like fucking kick a dude in the face.

18:31.040 --> 18:32.720
I thought they retired from weddings.

18:33.760 --> 18:34.640
This is amazing.

18:36.960 --> 18:38.640
Oh my god, it's Drew Carey.

18:38.640 --> 18:39.920
Drew Carey's in the mix now.

18:42.000 --> 18:45.040
See, that's appropriate, because he was in the Navy, right?

18:45.040 --> 18:46.560
And he was in the royal rumble.

18:46.560 --> 18:48.800
My grooms would look a lot older than I remember them.

18:49.680 --> 18:51.200
They don't look like they're in very good shape.

18:52.240 --> 18:55.200
But their face paint looks amazing.

18:55.200 --> 18:56.320
Did you see Kelly Kelly?

18:56.320 --> 18:58.400
She looks so beautiful.

18:59.680 --> 19:01.600
Assuming it's a she, she looks beautiful.

19:02.560 --> 19:04.400
Assuming Kelly Kelly is a woman.

19:04.400 --> 19:06.400
She's one of the, she's part of the glow, right?

19:06.400 --> 19:07.680
The gorgeous ladies of wrestling.

19:07.680 --> 19:08.640
Is that still an entity?

19:08.640 --> 19:10.480
Is that, I haven't kept up.

19:10.480 --> 19:13.200
That is the most offensive name I've ever heard.

19:13.200 --> 19:15.120
Is that really a title for a group?

19:15.120 --> 19:16.880
I don't think it's extant, but yes.

19:19.200 --> 19:23.040
They used to show gorgeous ladies of wrestling.

19:23.040 --> 19:25.360
Saturday mornings, I think.

19:26.400 --> 19:32.720
I think you gotta go with two second stringers.

19:32.720 --> 19:33.760
Holograms.

19:33.760 --> 19:34.480
Holograms.

19:34.480 --> 19:36.720
If you tell me that the Navy doesn't have that kind of technology,

19:36.720 --> 19:38.240
you're gonna fuck right off,

19:38.240 --> 19:40.880
because they all live in boats under the sea.

19:40.880 --> 19:43.040
What is the odds on cardboard cutouts?

19:43.040 --> 19:44.960
What is the situation with that?

19:45.920 --> 19:48.320
That the lady could like just kind of carry down.

19:49.760 --> 19:51.520
What about animatronics?

19:51.520 --> 19:52.640
Oh shit.

19:52.640 --> 19:54.320
I love animatronics.

19:54.320 --> 19:56.960
You call the fungineers at Disney, they'll set you right up.

19:56.960 --> 19:58.320
The sorry?

19:58.320 --> 19:59.280
The fungineers?

19:59.920 --> 20:01.840
The fungineers?

20:01.840 --> 20:02.960
Yeah, they make fungineers.

20:02.960 --> 20:04.160
The imaginauts.

20:04.160 --> 20:05.200
The imaginauts.

20:05.920 --> 20:06.880
Imaginistas.

20:07.920 --> 20:09.600
Guys, listen, we don't need to give him-

20:09.600 --> 20:11.280
Call the creationoids.

20:12.960 --> 20:13.920
We don't need to give him a bunch of

20:13.920 --> 20:17.200
phony baloney bullshit answers like cardboard cutouts and robots.

20:17.200 --> 20:18.800
Let's talk about holograms.

20:18.800 --> 20:20.960
Let's talk about real tech.

20:20.960 --> 20:23.600
Will.i.am taught me this technology exists.

20:23.600 --> 20:25.920
I have seen Wolf Blitzer made of light.

20:28.560 --> 20:31.920
As opposed to the regular Wolf Blitzer that's made of pure darkness.

20:34.080 --> 20:35.680
He's the most hateful man in America.

20:36.480 --> 20:38.000
That's statistics.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.760
Rich, I think you gotta get backups.

20:39.760 --> 20:42.240
Just get two other guys you know sort of well,

20:42.880 --> 20:46.720
and if your roommates or your good groomsmen should happen to make it,

20:46.720 --> 20:48.480
you just gotta give those guys the old heave-ho.

20:48.480 --> 20:52.720
Mm-hmm, and bonus if they kind of look like your two original choices,

20:52.720 --> 20:54.320
and you only shoot them in wide shots.

20:55.920 --> 20:58.240
It's good to- but they do have to do their stunts.

21:00.000 --> 21:03.920
Last year, I met an incredible girl who I've since developed feelings for.

21:03.920 --> 21:06.080
Unfortunately, she was in a relationship at the time.

21:06.080 --> 21:08.960
Recently, however, they've gone through a messy and drawn-out breakup.

21:10.800 --> 21:14.480
So now she's single, but seems to have a fair bit of baggage to deal with.

21:14.480 --> 21:17.440
I know she's interested in me, and I think I can make her happy.

21:17.440 --> 21:20.640
The problem is that I've been with girls who just come out of relationships before,

21:20.640 --> 21:22.480
and it's always turned out pretty badly.

21:22.480 --> 21:26.560
Am I better off giving her space now and risk missing my chance,

21:26.560 --> 21:31.760
or making a move in the hope that this time will be different?

21:32.320 --> 21:32.560
Tim.

21:33.360 --> 21:36.080
Girls fresh out of relationships.

21:36.080 --> 21:40.000
The- you know that I've heard that refer to the rebound they call it sometimes.

21:42.000 --> 21:42.800
The rebound.

21:42.800 --> 21:48.320
Well, yes, but like, I started dating Teresa pretty fresh out of a relationship.

21:48.320 --> 21:51.040
Granted, that one wasn't messy or drawn out or anything.

21:51.040 --> 21:55.680
I think that that's the component of this, that it's not that she's fresh out of a relationship,

21:55.680 --> 21:57.280
but that it didn't end well.

21:58.240 --> 22:00.240
That's where it gets a little bit dicey.

22:00.240 --> 22:04.400
I think that anytime- I think you gotta put your heart out there.

22:04.400 --> 22:08.640
I don't think you can worry too much about the situations that lead people into,

22:08.640 --> 22:11.920
where, you know, where they ended up. When I started dating my wife,

22:11.920 --> 22:17.840
she was out of a four or five year relationship, fresh out, matter of fact.

22:17.840 --> 22:23.360
She was just waiting for her knight in shining armor, her special warrior,

22:23.360 --> 22:29.280
as I refer to myself unironically, to sweep her off her feet.

22:29.280 --> 22:31.680
I've totally flipped. I'm with you, Justin.

22:31.680 --> 22:33.120
What's the worst that's gonna happen?

22:33.120 --> 22:35.120
Like, so either you don't take a shot,

22:35.120 --> 22:38.720
or you take a shot and it doesn't work out. The end result is still the same.

22:38.720 --> 22:41.760
But what if you take that shot and it totally works out?

22:41.760 --> 22:45.280
Yeah, take that shot. There's other girls, trust me.

22:45.280 --> 22:46.880
Just take that shot and-

22:46.880 --> 22:47.920
Here's another point.

22:47.920 --> 22:51.440
What if you die before the end of this podcast?

22:51.440 --> 22:54.320
What if you should- here's what you should do.

22:54.320 --> 22:57.440
In fact, bad news, you will die at the end of this podcast.

22:57.440 --> 23:00.560
We'll try to stretch it out as much as we can.

23:00.560 --> 23:06.560
You have one podcast left to live. If you only had one podcast left, I would just spend it with us, I hope.

23:06.560 --> 23:10.560
Tim, just call her right now.

23:10.560 --> 23:14.560
Live like you were dying at the end of this podcast.

23:14.560 --> 23:18.560
Pick it up, call her, fuck it, right?

23:18.560 --> 23:22.560
I mean, if it doesn't work out, oh well, you learned a valuable lesson.

23:22.560 --> 23:26.560
It sounds like you may have already actually learned that lesson before with other girls.

23:26.560 --> 23:30.560
But you obviously haven't learned it hard enough.

23:30.560 --> 23:34.560
You'll still be alone and you'll still be facing imminent death.

23:34.560 --> 23:36.560
Yep.

23:36.560 --> 23:38.560
Just constantly.

23:38.560 --> 23:40.560
What's up now?

23:40.560 --> 23:42.560
What is up?

23:42.560 --> 23:44.560
Welcome to our comedy podcast.

23:44.560 --> 23:48.560
Welcome to our comedy podcast that we have together.

23:48.560 --> 23:50.560
It's called Death is Creepin'.

23:50.560 --> 23:52.560
Death be creepin', you best be callin'.

23:52.560 --> 24:02.560
That's our new segment where you make peace with your impending doom and you just go ahead and call her already.

24:02.560 --> 24:04.560
This Yahoo was sent in by Louie Dog.

24:04.560 --> 24:06.560
Thanks Louie Dog.

24:06.560 --> 24:10.560
It's by Yahoo Answers user Leprechaun Tori.

24:10.560 --> 24:14.560
Leprechaun Tori asks,

24:14.560 --> 24:20.560
My best friend and I are starting up a babysitting company where we live and we need a name. Any help?

24:20.560 --> 24:24.560
Right. She's 14 and I'm going to be 14 in May.

24:24.560 --> 24:30.560
We are both CPR certified and we both most definitely want to be babysitters.

24:30.560 --> 24:35.560
Our names are Aja, her, and Victoria, me, but I like to be called Tori.

24:35.560 --> 24:37.560
Thank you to all who help and tribute.

24:37.560 --> 24:40.560
We had a name, but we decided we didn't like it.

24:40.560 --> 24:44.560
It was Monsters and Fairy Tales, but it didn't stick with us.

24:44.560 --> 24:52.560
Baby Smothers Incorporated.

24:52.560 --> 24:54.560
Nope, nope, nope. That's really bad.

24:54.560 --> 24:56.560
That's pretty bad.

24:56.560 --> 24:58.560
Marginally better than Monsters and Fairy Tales.

24:58.560 --> 25:03.560
Honey, look in the phone book for something relating to babysitters.

25:03.560 --> 25:06.560
We got Monsters and Fairy Tales.

25:06.560 --> 25:09.560
I don't know what kind of service or product they provide though.

25:09.560 --> 25:11.560
What about the Snuggle Core? Is that good?

25:11.560 --> 25:12.560
Like C-O-R-P-S?

25:12.560 --> 25:13.560
Yeah, C-O-R-P-S.

25:13.560 --> 25:15.560
What about the Snuggle Army?

25:15.560 --> 25:17.560
That is also my favorite.

25:17.560 --> 25:19.560
That's my favorite genre by the way right now.

25:19.560 --> 25:21.560
Snuggle Core. Have you heard it?

25:21.560 --> 25:23.560
It's really good.

25:23.560 --> 25:25.560
That's what Hinder is, right?

25:25.560 --> 25:26.560
I've never heard Hinder.

25:26.560 --> 25:27.560
Hinder is Snuggle Core.

25:27.560 --> 25:29.560
Let me just, let me drop some.

25:29.560 --> 25:30.560
What about Enron?

25:30.560 --> 25:32.560
They're not using it anymore, right?

25:32.560 --> 25:33.560
The Enron of babysitting.

25:33.560 --> 25:38.560
I have a few Yahoo responses.

25:38.560 --> 25:40.560
Oh, good.

25:40.560 --> 25:43.560
John says, Prestige Worldwide.

25:43.560 --> 25:44.560
Wait, what?

25:44.560 --> 25:45.560
Prestige?

25:45.560 --> 25:48.560
Yeah, like Prestige, only you spell it wrong because you're 14.

25:48.560 --> 25:53.560
It's kind of like how Kidz Bop has like a Z and the Z is also backwards.

25:53.560 --> 25:55.560
Sure, okay.

25:55.560 --> 26:00.560
Hey officer, Kidz Bop would be a pretty good name.

26:00.560 --> 26:04.560
Adriana says, Super Sitters.

26:04.560 --> 26:06.560
Care for critters.

26:06.560 --> 26:08.560
Care for kids.

26:08.560 --> 26:10.560
Nancy is misleading.

26:10.560 --> 26:15.560
Aja and Tori, the two that complete the story.

26:15.560 --> 26:17.560
Wait, what?

26:17.560 --> 26:21.560
Aja and Tori, more for the glory.

26:21.560 --> 26:23.560
What?

26:23.560 --> 26:24.560
What?

26:24.560 --> 26:27.560
Are they barbarians?

26:27.560 --> 26:30.560
What is their career?

26:30.560 --> 26:31.560
More for the glory?

26:31.560 --> 26:34.560
This was some glorious babysitting today, Tori.

26:34.560 --> 26:36.560
The day is ours.

26:36.560 --> 26:38.560
T'was.

26:38.560 --> 26:43.560
We shall bathe this day in Valhalla.

26:43.560 --> 26:46.560
Youngsters helping the young ones.

26:46.560 --> 26:52.560
That's good because you want to really reinforce your leaving your children with children, other children.

26:52.560 --> 26:55.560
Irresponsible children watching children.

26:55.560 --> 26:57.560
Babies helping babies.

26:57.560 --> 26:59.560
Barely out of puberty, ink.

26:59.560 --> 27:02.560
The circle of baby help.

27:02.560 --> 27:05.560
You can call it who's babysitting who.

27:05.560 --> 27:06.560
Who let the babies out?

27:06.560 --> 27:08.560
We would never.

27:08.560 --> 27:09.560
What about that?

27:09.560 --> 27:11.560
That's pretty good, right?

27:11.560 --> 27:13.560
Runts and Rugrats.

27:13.560 --> 27:17.560
See, there you have trademark issues with both the candy and the television.

27:17.560 --> 27:18.560
You gotta get some z's in there.

27:18.560 --> 27:20.560
You gotta get some z's.

27:20.560 --> 27:21.560
Runts.

27:21.560 --> 27:23.560
Runts.

27:23.560 --> 27:24.560
And Rugrats.

27:24.560 --> 27:32.560
What about rug with two g's to make it hard?

27:32.560 --> 27:36.560
This is the most street babysitting outfit I think ever.

27:36.560 --> 27:38.560
Pretty much.

27:38.560 --> 27:43.560
If you want street babysitting that's just really raw and really what's happening today,

27:43.560 --> 27:46.560
get rug with two g's and Rugrats.

27:46.560 --> 27:54.560
It's hard to get on this baby's level unless you are as street as it is.

27:54.560 --> 27:56.560
We're talking like fresh out of the womb.

27:56.560 --> 27:59.560
There are babies who are so street.

27:59.560 --> 28:00.560
So street wise.

28:00.560 --> 28:03.560
Since your baby was fresh out of the womb, it's been so street.

28:03.560 --> 28:08.560
Where do you find care that matches that level of real core authenticity?

28:08.560 --> 28:10.560
I find it with Rugrats.

28:10.560 --> 28:11.560
It's got two g's and a z.

28:11.560 --> 28:13.560
And the z is backwards in the phone book.

28:13.560 --> 28:15.560
I didn't know they could do.

28:15.560 --> 28:17.560
They're gonna have to pay a premium for that.

28:17.560 --> 28:19.560
But I think it's gonna be worth it.

28:19.560 --> 28:24.560
I want you guys to know that I zoned out because I started picturing street babies and they

28:24.560 --> 28:25.560
made me really happy.

28:25.560 --> 28:28.560
Yeah, I mean I think it's a pretty positive mental image.

28:28.560 --> 28:31.560
But if only we could write some jokes about it too.

28:31.560 --> 28:33.560
You can't get lost along the path here.

28:33.560 --> 28:34.560
No, no, no.

28:34.560 --> 28:39.560
Listen, Travis is on to some next level shit because we don't really need to tell jokes

28:39.560 --> 28:40.560
anymore.

28:40.560 --> 28:45.560
We can just paint images in our listeners minds and they can come up with the jokes

28:45.560 --> 28:46.560
themselves.

28:46.560 --> 28:47.560
I am so tired right now.

28:47.560 --> 28:49.560
Imagine babies with gold teeth.

28:49.560 --> 28:52.560
Everybody, get this picture in your mind that Travis is painting.

28:52.560 --> 28:53.560
Really think about it.

28:53.560 --> 28:54.560
Gold teeth.

28:54.560 --> 28:55.560
Bandana.

28:55.560 --> 28:59.560
Maybe a tattoo that says, uh, rug's life.

28:59.560 --> 29:00.560
Good.

29:00.560 --> 29:01.560
Rug life.

29:01.560 --> 29:02.560
Okay.

29:02.560 --> 29:03.560
Love it.

29:03.560 --> 29:04.560
That's it.

29:04.560 --> 29:05.560
What is that baby listening to?

29:05.560 --> 29:09.560
Baby Tupac.

29:09.560 --> 29:11.560
It's reincarnated Tupac.

29:11.560 --> 29:12.560
No, trick question.

29:12.560 --> 29:13.560
No, trick question.

29:13.560 --> 29:14.560
Tupac's still alive.

29:14.560 --> 29:16.560
So it's not reincarnated Tupac.

29:16.560 --> 29:19.560
Except it's T-W-O-Pac.

29:19.560 --> 29:20.560
Because he's terrible.

29:20.560 --> 29:24.560
Terrible Tupac.

29:24.560 --> 29:28.560
He's listening to, uh, oh fuck.

29:28.560 --> 29:29.560
What was it?

29:29.560 --> 29:30.560
Lamb chop.

29:30.560 --> 29:31.560
Biggie.

29:31.560 --> 29:32.560
Good, man.

29:32.560 --> 29:33.560
Fuck.

29:33.560 --> 29:34.560
Lamb chop, but also Biggie.

29:34.560 --> 29:35.560
Lamb chop and Biggie.

29:35.560 --> 29:36.560
Oh, fuck.

29:36.560 --> 29:37.560
You are zinging this one.

29:37.560 --> 29:38.560
Listen.

29:38.560 --> 29:39.560
Listen, guys.

29:39.560 --> 29:40.560
Listen.

29:40.560 --> 29:41.560
Listen.

29:41.560 --> 29:42.560
Wait.

29:42.560 --> 29:43.560
Hold on.

29:43.560 --> 29:44.560
Muppet babies.

29:44.560 --> 29:45.560
Don't go.

29:45.560 --> 29:46.560
Only Biggie's in the mix.

29:46.560 --> 29:49.560
Muppet babies, but, but, but gangsters.

29:49.560 --> 29:53.560
Teletubbies and, and also Busta.

29:53.560 --> 29:54.560
Fuck.

29:54.560 --> 29:55.560
No.

29:55.560 --> 29:57.560
See, obviously these jokes aren't working.

29:57.560 --> 29:58.560
Just do them yourself.

29:58.560 --> 29:59.560
Just wait.

29:59.560 --> 30:00.560
Just wait.

30:00.560 --> 30:01.560
Listen.

30:01.560 --> 30:04.560
We could get you to there, but we want you to start making up jokes on your own.

30:04.560 --> 30:07.560
The magic was in you the whole time.

30:07.560 --> 30:08.560
Just imagine.

30:08.560 --> 30:09.560
Thug babies.

30:09.560 --> 30:10.560
Uh, okay.

30:10.560 --> 30:11.560
And you're there.

30:11.560 --> 30:13.560
Listen, we, we've, we've stalled for long enough.

30:13.560 --> 30:19.560
Uh, I think, personally, I think we've, we waited, uh, for this, for this journey we're

30:19.560 --> 30:20.560
about to take right now.

30:20.560 --> 30:41.560
Just a bunch of friends headed to the money zone.

30:41.560 --> 30:46.560
So this year, Curtis Worley wants us to wish his friend, his dear friend, Robbville.

30:46.560 --> 30:47.560
I'm sorry.

30:47.560 --> 30:48.560
I tried.

30:48.560 --> 30:50.560
Rob Mumblebup.

30:50.560 --> 30:51.560
Rob Mumblebup.

30:51.560 --> 30:52.560
Rob Mulvey.

30:52.560 --> 30:53.560
Mulvey Hill.

30:53.560 --> 30:54.560
Yeah, that's it.

30:54.560 --> 30:55.560
That's good.

30:55.560 --> 30:56.560
Rob Mulvey Hill.

30:56.560 --> 30:57.560
I like Mumblebup better.

30:57.560 --> 30:58.560
All right.

30:58.560 --> 30:59.560
Rob Mumblebup.

30:59.560 --> 31:01.560
A very happy 27th birthday.

31:01.560 --> 31:04.560
Rob is a huge fan of Mubim Bam.

31:04.560 --> 31:06.560
We are a, a little late on this one.

31:06.560 --> 31:09.560
His birthday, his birthday was April 2nd.

31:09.560 --> 31:10.560
Oh, okay.

31:10.560 --> 31:12.560
Only 23 days late.

31:12.560 --> 31:15.560
Hey, when you go, when you go belated, you go Mubim Bam.

31:15.560 --> 31:20.560
That's our, that's our new, uh, sales angle that we're using.

31:20.560 --> 31:23.560
Uh, so, so tell me some things about Rob.

31:23.560 --> 31:26.560
Hit me with some Rob, some Robtoids, as we say.

31:26.560 --> 31:29.560
Um, well, his name is very short.

31:29.560 --> 31:32.560
Very, very easy to spell.

31:32.560 --> 31:33.560
Very quick.

31:33.560 --> 31:36.560
If you're on, if you're doing a standardized test, that's only three bubbles.

31:36.560 --> 31:37.560
It trips off the tongue.

31:37.560 --> 31:38.560
Right off the next one.

31:38.560 --> 31:41.560
Rob Mumblebup, right off the tongue.

31:41.560 --> 31:43.560
You are still doing that wrong, but go right ahead.

31:43.560 --> 31:44.560
Tell me more.

31:44.560 --> 31:45.560
I'm intrigued.

31:45.560 --> 31:47.560
You know what the, you know what the BUP's favorite team is?

31:47.560 --> 31:48.560
Tell me.

31:48.560 --> 31:49.560
The Detroit Red Wings.

31:49.560 --> 31:50.560
Perfect.

31:50.560 --> 31:51.560
They play hockey.

31:51.560 --> 31:52.560
Love it.

31:52.560 --> 31:56.560
Curtis Vorlie has, uh, included this on his enumerated list of Rob features.

31:56.560 --> 31:57.560
Yeah.

31:57.560 --> 31:58.560
So the bullet points for Rob.

31:58.560 --> 32:02.560
He took us right to the Rob Zone, and he wrote, um, Detroit Red Wings, parentheses, hockey

32:02.560 --> 32:03.560
team.

32:03.560 --> 32:04.560
Thanks, Curtis.

32:04.560 --> 32:05.560
Thanks, Curtis.

32:05.560 --> 32:06.560
Because we're idiot babies.

32:06.560 --> 32:07.560
For the vote of confidence.

32:07.560 --> 32:11.560
There are some people on this show that appreciate that kind of insight.

32:11.560 --> 32:14.560
Um, what about his favorite metal band, though?

32:14.560 --> 32:17.560
If I, if you had to pick one, let me hear it now.

32:17.560 --> 32:20.560
Um, it actually doesn't say, here's the thing, Curtis.

32:20.560 --> 32:24.560
I don't want to make Curtis paid for this message, um, to, to honor Rob.

32:24.560 --> 32:28.560
So I don't want to make it all about Curtis, but I feel like I have to give him some advice.

32:28.560 --> 32:33.560
Uh, as far as list making goes, cause he wrote some things about Bob.

32:33.560 --> 32:34.560
Underwroth.

32:34.560 --> 32:36.560
You don't say.

32:36.560 --> 32:37.560
Is he in Underwroth?

32:37.560 --> 32:40.560
Cause that'd be pretty fresh.

32:40.560 --> 32:41.560
Is it a band that he likes?

32:41.560 --> 32:43.560
Is it a band he doesn't like?

32:43.560 --> 32:45.560
He hates Underwroth.

32:45.560 --> 32:46.560
You should see him.

32:46.560 --> 32:47.560
This is my friend Rob.

32:47.560 --> 32:49.560
He is equivocal about Underwroth.

32:49.560 --> 32:52.560
And then Curtis has really brought it home with his last one.

32:52.560 --> 32:53.560
Yeah.

32:53.560 --> 32:54.560
Beards.

32:54.560 --> 32:55.560
Okay.

32:55.560 --> 32:56.560
Does he have a beard?

32:56.560 --> 32:57.560
He has multiple beards.

32:57.560 --> 32:59.560
Hey, this is multi-beard Rob.

32:59.560 --> 33:01.560
He's my dear, dear friend.

33:01.560 --> 33:02.560
I love him very much.

33:02.560 --> 33:04.560
He has a beard for all occasions.

33:04.560 --> 33:06.560
He did a good job with his accent, though.

33:06.560 --> 33:07.560
He's a drummer.

33:07.560 --> 33:08.560
See, that's, that we could work with.

33:08.560 --> 33:09.560
Yeah.

33:09.560 --> 33:11.560
He makes some giggles about that, but beards?

33:11.560 --> 33:13.560
He's got a beard on his chin.

33:13.560 --> 33:15.560
He's got a beard on his beard.

33:15.560 --> 33:16.560
His nose has a beard.

33:16.560 --> 33:20.560
It's called a mustache, but he calls it his nose beard.

33:20.560 --> 33:22.560
That's why I love Mumble Bup.

33:22.560 --> 33:24.560
He's got a way with words.

33:24.560 --> 33:26.560
Mumble Bup, happy birthday.

33:26.560 --> 33:28.560
Uh, sorry about your friend Curtis.

33:28.560 --> 33:31.560
He, he does, his heart's in the right place.

33:31.560 --> 33:32.560
God bless him.

33:32.560 --> 33:36.560
But his list making abilities are in oblivion.

33:36.560 --> 33:37.560
They're in space.

33:37.560 --> 33:38.560
He doesn't possess them.

33:38.560 --> 33:40.560
They, they're, they might as well not exist.

33:40.560 --> 33:44.560
Our other, uh, uh, special, special message this week

33:44.560 --> 33:49.560
is from PC perspective, back our first, very first

33:49.560 --> 33:50.560
Can't get enough.

33:50.560 --> 33:51.560
Repeat sponsor.

33:51.560 --> 33:55.560
I heard that their industry business numbers

33:55.560 --> 33:57.560
Yeah, just really good industry business.

33:57.560 --> 34:01.560
Their sums, their money calculations, um, supply and demand

34:01.560 --> 34:07.560
I hear it all went up 400 percent.

34:07.560 --> 34:08.560
Whoa.

34:08.560 --> 34:09.560
Wow.

34:09.560 --> 34:10.560
Right through that glass ceiling.

34:10.560 --> 34:11.560
Seems.

34:11.560 --> 34:12.560
That's what that means.

34:12.560 --> 34:13.560
Smashed right through it.

34:13.560 --> 34:15.560
We gave them, we gave them a tune and we gave them

34:15.560 --> 34:18.560
that sponsorship and everybody's like, oh, glad I get it.

34:18.560 --> 34:20.560
They got so corny for PCs.

34:20.560 --> 34:23.560
Now, Griffin, what does, what does PC stand for again?

34:23.560 --> 34:28.560
Uh, it stands for prickly cactus.

34:28.560 --> 34:29.560
Prickly cactus.

34:29.560 --> 34:30.560
Think about it.

34:30.560 --> 34:31.560
I'm not quite sure that's right.

34:31.560 --> 34:35.560
PC perspective is a great spot for information, in-depth

34:35.560 --> 34:37.560
reviews of PC components and technology news.

34:37.560 --> 34:40.560
They got a hardware leaderboard at pcperd.com forward slash

34:40.560 --> 34:42.560
H W L B.

34:42.560 --> 34:44.560
Great page for recommendation to see new PC builds

34:44.560 --> 34:46.560
without having to dive into tons of detail.

34:46.560 --> 34:47.560
Guess what guys?

34:47.560 --> 34:48.560
Hit me.

34:48.560 --> 34:50.560
I just checked the leaderboard.

34:50.560 --> 34:51.560
How's your rig?

34:51.560 --> 34:52.560
My rig?

34:52.560 --> 34:53.560
It's number three.

34:53.560 --> 34:54.560
Whoa.

34:54.560 --> 34:55.560
Whoa.

34:55.560 --> 34:56.560
Whoa.

34:56.560 --> 34:57.560
That's a big, that's a good rig.

34:57.560 --> 34:58.560
The only.

34:58.560 --> 34:59.560
I bet it's putting up.

34:59.560 --> 35:02.560
The only people who are above me are Bill Gates

35:02.560 --> 35:05.560
and the Apple Bill Gates.

35:05.560 --> 35:06.560
Apple Bill Gates?

35:06.560 --> 35:07.560
Uh-huh.

35:07.560 --> 35:08.560
Wow.

35:08.560 --> 35:09.560
Cool.

35:09.560 --> 35:10.560
And he's a PC user, huh?

35:10.560 --> 35:11.560
Uh-huh.

35:11.560 --> 35:12.560
That seems odd to me.

35:12.560 --> 35:13.560
It is weird.

35:13.560 --> 35:14.560
Hey, know thy enemy.

35:14.560 --> 35:17.560
If you want to discuss how odd that is, you should go to

35:17.560 --> 35:18.560
PCPerforms.

35:18.560 --> 35:23.560
They got a podcast, pcperd.com forward slash podcast,

35:23.560 --> 35:26.560
where they tell you about PC stuff.

35:26.560 --> 35:29.560
It doesn't have as many jokes as ours, but unlike ours,

35:29.560 --> 35:31.560
there is some worth listening to.

35:31.560 --> 35:34.560
I hope they will actually better your life in some way.

35:34.560 --> 35:36.560
I hope that they have jingles about us.

35:36.560 --> 35:39.560
Yeah, I hope they've written a jingle or two about our show.

35:39.560 --> 35:42.560
My brother and my brother and me instead of our show.

35:42.560 --> 35:44.560
Nasty, I'm on the track.

35:44.560 --> 35:45.560
I have to start again.

35:45.560 --> 35:48.560
So go to pcper.com.

35:48.560 --> 35:50.560
So what have you worked up so far?

35:50.560 --> 35:51.560
You know what?

35:51.560 --> 35:54.560
I've been working on it all morning trying to get a jingle

35:54.560 --> 35:59.560
together that can combine the magic of Rob Bumby book

35:59.560 --> 36:03.560
and PC perspective and the services that they both offer.

36:03.560 --> 36:06.560
And I'd like to take everyone back.

36:06.560 --> 36:12.560
I'd like to take everyone back on a journey with me to,

36:12.560 --> 36:17.560
I would say, the soundtrack of the year 2001.

36:17.560 --> 36:18.560
You think 2001?

36:18.560 --> 36:19.560
Yeah.

36:19.560 --> 36:20.560
I'm trying to think.

36:20.560 --> 36:22.560
That was my freshman year of high school.

36:22.560 --> 36:24.560
I was really into Apollo 440 back then.

36:24.560 --> 36:25.560
Okay.

36:25.560 --> 36:29.560
So maybe if you saw Lost in Space, the film,

36:29.560 --> 36:34.560
maybe if you saw Gone in 60 Seconds, the remake,

36:34.560 --> 36:38.560
you'll know this spoof.

36:38.560 --> 36:59.560
Can't stop the Rob.

36:59.560 --> 37:02.560
Can't stop the Rob.

37:02.560 --> 37:05.560
Can't stop the Rob.

37:05.560 --> 37:08.560
Can't stop the Rob.

37:08.560 --> 37:09.560
Can't stop the Rob.

37:09.560 --> 37:11.560
You can't stop the Rob.

37:11.560 --> 37:12.560
Can't stop the Rob.

37:12.560 --> 37:14.560
You can't stop the Rob.

37:14.560 --> 37:15.560
Can't stop the Rob.

37:15.560 --> 37:17.560
You can't stop the Rob.

37:17.560 --> 37:18.560
Can't stop the Rob.

37:18.560 --> 37:21.560
Can't stop the Rob.

37:21.560 --> 37:22.560
That's all right.

37:22.560 --> 37:23.560
Hold on.

37:23.560 --> 37:25.560
That's the only...

37:25.560 --> 37:28.560
That's a goof and you know how long I worked on that?

37:28.560 --> 37:30.560
All right, so what I can do is...

37:30.560 --> 37:33.560
So if we had to do a pros and cons of that.

37:33.560 --> 37:34.920
Okay, pro

37:34.920 --> 37:36.920
Rob heavily featured Rob

37:37.120 --> 37:38.280
Khan

37:38.280 --> 37:44.080
The lack of any concrete details about this Rob person or our secondary sponsor piece

37:44.080 --> 37:48.640
It's like oh other than that though fucking slam X on their oath

37:49.840 --> 37:51.840
He likes a Detroit Red Wings

37:52.960 --> 37:55.160
He has a number of beards

37:56.160 --> 38:01.080
He's got a last name. That's impossible to pronounce. He's a king

38:01.080 --> 38:03.080
of

38:03.360 --> 38:05.360
Computer Town

38:05.840 --> 38:07.840
He's the king

38:08.760 --> 38:10.760
Of Computer Town

38:12.040 --> 38:14.040
He reads PC per

38:15.760 --> 38:17.760
Dot com

38:18.440 --> 38:20.440
They've got forums

38:21.080 --> 38:23.640
and a podcast

38:23.640 --> 38:34.200
Starring Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob

38:38.200 --> 38:44.440
There it is he brought home now except for your insistence that Rob is the star of the PC per podcast

38:44.420 --> 38:46.420
That's really great

38:46.420 --> 38:48.140
Have you listened to it?

38:48.140 --> 38:48.980
What?

38:48.980 --> 38:51.300
Have you listened to the PC Pro Podcast?

38:51.300 --> 38:52.140
You know what?

38:52.140 --> 38:53.060
I did.

38:53.060 --> 38:53.900
I did.

38:53.900 --> 38:55.260
Rob, I did not catch him.

38:55.260 --> 38:57.580
Let me ask you a second question, a follow up.

38:57.580 --> 38:58.540
Okay.

38:58.540 --> 39:00.520
Have you seen Gone in 60 Seconds?

39:00.520 --> 39:01.360
Yeah.

39:01.360 --> 39:02.180
Pretty good play.

39:02.180 --> 39:03.540
I don't feel like you guys got the song.

39:03.540 --> 39:05.700
Like you guys got the goof or the spoof.

39:05.700 --> 39:08.700
I have a friend who's a girl, I'm a guy,

39:08.700 --> 39:11.360
who steals all my male friends.

39:11.360 --> 39:12.300
I'll meet someone new,

39:12.300 --> 39:13.420
and then as soon as I meet this girl,

39:13.420 --> 39:15.100
they start hanging out with her instead of me,

39:15.100 --> 39:17.060
a fact she constantly reminds me of.

39:17.060 --> 39:19.860
I've got a chance to win back her most recent theft

39:19.860 --> 39:21.760
at a wedding all three of us are attending.

39:21.760 --> 39:23.260
I need some good advice.

39:23.260 --> 39:25.620
What can I do to win back this bromance?

39:25.620 --> 39:26.700
Thomas.

39:26.700 --> 39:30.000
You know, it's funny we should get that question.

39:30.000 --> 39:31.580
Not it, this is not a spoof.

39:31.580 --> 39:32.660
This is not a goof.

39:32.660 --> 39:35.460
Not, I don't know, an hour or two later,

39:35.460 --> 39:37.720
we received this question.

39:37.720 --> 39:39.060
I have a friend who's a guy

39:39.060 --> 39:40.980
that claims I keep stealing his bros

39:40.980 --> 39:43.600
because they end up calling me to hang out instead of him,

39:43.600 --> 39:46.540
but I can't help that one, I'm more fun to hang out with,

39:46.540 --> 39:48.260
and two, I'm a girl.

39:48.260 --> 39:49.440
He's currently trying to claim

39:49.440 --> 39:51.340
our newest Canadian friend for himself.

39:51.340 --> 39:54.820
How can I keep from him boxing me out of this friendship?

39:54.820 --> 39:56.640
An upcoming wedding is the next time

39:56.640 --> 39:57.780
we all hang out in the same place.

39:57.780 --> 39:58.820
Holy shit.

39:58.820 --> 40:01.580
Is that the best time to make my move?

40:01.580 --> 40:03.880
Obviously, I'll be looking hot.

40:03.880 --> 40:05.020
Daniel.

40:05.020 --> 40:05.860
Or Danielle.

40:05.860 --> 40:07.460
I think probably James, yeah.

40:07.460 --> 40:08.300
Danielli.

40:08.300 --> 40:10.860
I think he got on that second pass, but.

40:10.860 --> 40:12.020
This is incredible.

40:12.020 --> 40:13.480
Has this ever happened before?

40:13.480 --> 40:15.540
This is the dueling.

40:15.540 --> 40:16.880
Hey, brothers, I hate Jeff.

40:16.880 --> 40:17.820
Love, Mark.

40:17.820 --> 40:19.080
Hey, brothers, I hate Mark.

40:19.080 --> 40:19.920
Love, Jeff.

40:23.260 --> 40:24.860
Man, this is a toughie.

40:24.860 --> 40:26.660
I feel like Thomas,

40:28.620 --> 40:30.100
there's something in Thomas' question

40:30.100 --> 40:31.180
where he does not realize

40:31.180 --> 40:35.420
the sort of insurmountable millennia-long odds

40:35.420 --> 40:36.860
that he's up against here.

40:38.000 --> 40:42.420
It's the basic heartbeat of the species

40:42.420 --> 40:43.660
that is thwarting you,

40:43.660 --> 40:46.140
not anything about yourself personally.

40:48.860 --> 40:52.480
Guys, I don't wanna keep beating a dead horse here,

40:52.480 --> 40:55.900
but the best solution is Wedding Mania 29.

40:55.900 --> 40:58.380
Again?

40:58.380 --> 40:59.340
Again.

40:59.340 --> 41:02.220
You smash Thomas with a folding chair.

41:02.220 --> 41:03.260
A wrestle wedding.

41:03.260 --> 41:05.660
Three friends enter, two friends leave.

41:05.660 --> 41:08.060
See, that's what we do.

41:08.060 --> 41:09.460
We get another ladder match.

41:09.460 --> 41:11.300
We put your friends on top of the ladder,

41:11.300 --> 41:14.460
and then Thomas and Danielle, or Danielly,

41:14.460 --> 41:16.280
they just go right at it.

41:16.280 --> 41:18.520
I wanna know what kind of cruel intentions

41:18.520 --> 41:20.780
like these two people are living in

41:20.780 --> 41:23.820
that they are constantly competing over new friends.

41:23.820 --> 41:26.620
Hey, did you steal Philip from me?

41:26.620 --> 41:29.260
Well, I mean, like, we went to Denny's last night.

41:29.260 --> 41:30.300
Is that what you mean?

41:30.300 --> 41:31.140
Like, yeah, in that-

41:31.140 --> 41:31.980
You son of a bitch.

41:31.980 --> 41:33.660
You son of a bitch.

41:33.660 --> 41:34.500
Last night-

41:34.500 --> 41:35.320
You got another one, Daniel.

41:35.320 --> 41:37.000
Denny's was our special place.

41:38.580 --> 41:39.420
You asshole.

41:39.420 --> 41:41.980
I told you that in confidence.

41:41.980 --> 41:45.140
I told you about how good their griddle cakes are.

41:45.140 --> 41:46.180
Just with secret.

41:46.180 --> 41:47.480
I thought it was a secret.

41:48.980 --> 41:50.980
Why can't you just all be friends?

41:50.980 --> 41:53.060
Why can't you all three be friends?

41:53.060 --> 41:56.020
Is it like every guy wants to, is that the thing?

41:56.020 --> 41:59.260
Is this like, like, is there another perspective

41:59.260 --> 42:02.620
from a friend who's like, I was hanging out with this guy

42:02.620 --> 42:07.060
and he had a sexy friend, and then I hung out with her

42:07.060 --> 42:09.660
and now she's, they're both getting weird about it.

42:10.660 --> 42:12.140
They just cry all the time.

42:12.140 --> 42:15.760
It sounds like Danielle is saying that Thomas

42:15.760 --> 42:18.100
kind of sucks to hang out with.

42:18.100 --> 42:22.000
Thomas, but he is a great facilitator of new friendships.

42:22.000 --> 42:23.540
He's like a realtor of friendships.

42:23.540 --> 42:25.260
Oh, so Thomas brings them in

42:25.260 --> 42:27.320
and then Danielle's the one who closes.

42:27.320 --> 42:28.940
Right, exactly.

42:28.940 --> 42:30.140
That's bullshit, man.

42:30.140 --> 42:32.560
Danielle, you gotta pass some of that,

42:32.560 --> 42:35.340
some of that sweet friendship juice back to Thomas.

42:35.340 --> 42:36.420
Pass it on down.

42:36.420 --> 42:38.260
Pass it down the line.

42:38.260 --> 42:39.100
Share with your buddy.

42:39.100 --> 42:40.820
To be fair, Danielle's not doing anything wrong.

42:40.820 --> 42:42.580
She's just better than Thomas.

42:42.580 --> 42:43.420
Yeah.

42:43.420 --> 42:44.740
Listen, nobody's saying that Thomas,

42:44.740 --> 42:46.900
nobody's saying Danielle isn't better than Thomas.

42:46.900 --> 42:49.380
Like, that much is obvious just from there.

42:49.380 --> 42:53.380
Do you know how many emoticons Thomas used in his email?

42:53.380 --> 42:54.220
Zero, you know what I mean?

42:54.220 --> 42:55.380
I don't know how he's feeling.

42:55.380 --> 42:57.340
He's like, he's like talking to data.

42:57.340 --> 42:59.420
Danielle used one and it was a winky face,

42:59.420 --> 43:01.540
which is my very favorite emoticon.

43:01.540 --> 43:02.380
Oh, really?

43:02.380 --> 43:03.460
Thomas, you know what helps?

43:03.460 --> 43:06.220
Don't refer to your friendships as bromances.

43:06.220 --> 43:07.060
Yeah, that would,

43:07.060 --> 43:07.880
that probably scared him off.

43:07.880 --> 43:09.860
I just met this new guy and we're in a bromance.

43:09.860 --> 43:11.380
Why doesn't he wanna hang out anymore?

43:11.380 --> 43:13.500
We got fly dude kisses all the time.

43:13.500 --> 43:17.340
I think he's a real bromosexual, just like myself,

43:17.340 --> 43:19.140
and I really love hanging out with him.

43:19.140 --> 43:21.100
Can we start referring to like,

43:22.220 --> 43:26.580
can we start calling like high fives and fist pounds

43:26.580 --> 43:27.400
and like chest bumps?

43:27.400 --> 43:29.620
Can we just refer to those as dude kisses?

43:29.620 --> 43:30.620
I think so.

43:32.340 --> 43:34.180
Just gave him a big bro smooch.

43:34.180 --> 43:36.820
It's not a big thing.

43:36.820 --> 43:38.020
Gave him a double fist pound.

43:38.020 --> 43:39.300
It was real European.

43:41.300 --> 43:43.140
That's how they do it there.

43:43.140 --> 43:44.780
I'm gonna get dude kisses going.

43:44.780 --> 43:46.940
I'm gonna get it started.

43:46.940 --> 43:47.780
I think you should.

43:47.780 --> 43:50.060
I think that would be cracking.

43:50.060 --> 43:54.500
Danielle, stop being so fucking greedy.

43:54.500 --> 43:55.340
Thomas is so lonely.

43:55.340 --> 43:56.900
Leave Thomas, be more awesome.

43:56.900 --> 43:58.980
Why don't you go back in the annals of the history,

43:58.980 --> 44:00.620
find a friend that you don't like anymore

44:00.620 --> 44:02.220
and give it back to Thomas.

44:02.220 --> 44:04.100
Oh, so you're saying like hand me down friends.

44:04.100 --> 44:05.340
Exactly.

44:05.340 --> 44:09.100
Make new friends, keep the old and give some to Thomas.

44:09.100 --> 44:10.100
Give some back to Thomas.

44:10.100 --> 44:11.580
Yeah, he'll appreciate it.

44:11.580 --> 44:13.380
Think of it as a friendship tax

44:13.380 --> 44:14.700
because Thomas does a lot for you

44:14.700 --> 44:16.780
vis-a-vis getting you friends.

44:16.780 --> 44:17.620
Exactly.

44:17.620 --> 44:19.780
You gotta kick back like 20% back to him

44:19.780 --> 44:22.820
and then 10% to social security

44:22.820 --> 44:26.180
so that when you're old and like ready for death,

44:26.180 --> 44:28.900
you have some friends that are waiting for you.

44:28.900 --> 44:31.660
Griffin, yahoos, I need them.

44:31.660 --> 44:35.820
Okay, I found these, I found two

44:35.820 --> 44:38.140
and I'm gonna try and combine them into one super question

44:38.140 --> 44:39.700
because they're topical.

44:39.700 --> 44:40.540
Okay.

44:42.140 --> 44:43.500
All right, here we go.

44:43.500 --> 44:45.980
Yahoo Answers user prego asks,

44:47.340 --> 44:50.140
what to do for Easter with no kids?

44:51.660 --> 44:53.420
My husband and I have no kids.

44:53.420 --> 44:54.780
Well, we are expecting.

44:54.780 --> 44:56.420
Congratulations.

44:56.420 --> 44:57.580
Way to go guys.

44:57.580 --> 45:01.500
Are there any ideas that we can do for Easter?

45:01.500 --> 45:03.900
I think it's gonna be raining Sunday too.

45:03.900 --> 45:07.140
Something fun, like a sexy egg hunt or something.

45:07.140 --> 45:09.060
Excuse me, sorry?

45:10.060 --> 45:12.660
Like a sexy egg hunt or something.

45:12.660 --> 45:15.420
It's the world's fastest egg hunt.

45:15.420 --> 45:17.180
That's one locale.

45:17.180 --> 45:19.300
Yahoo Answers user corsair asks,

45:19.300 --> 45:22.580
what are some good ideas for my boyfriend's Easter eggs?

45:22.580 --> 45:24.260
My boyfriend and I are being silly this year

45:24.260 --> 45:25.460
and having an egg hunt

45:25.460 --> 45:27.580
and we're filling each other's eggs with little things.

45:27.580 --> 45:29.060
I filled about half with candy

45:29.060 --> 45:32.580
but I need some cute sexy ideas to fill the rest.

45:32.580 --> 45:35.220
I'd like a few of them to be rather suggestive

45:35.220 --> 45:36.660
but nothing is coming to mind.

45:36.660 --> 45:38.180
The trick is that whatever it is,

45:38.180 --> 45:40.460
it has to fit inside of one of those plastic eggs.

45:40.460 --> 45:41.300
Help?

45:41.300 --> 45:43.580
So, two questions.

45:43.580 --> 45:48.580
I think the first is more sexy egg hunt general topic ideas.

45:48.620 --> 45:51.540
Where does one hide a sexy egg hunt egg?

45:51.540 --> 45:54.660
Second being, what do you fill your sexy eggs with?

45:54.660 --> 45:55.500
You're saying?

45:55.500 --> 45:56.340
Mustard gas.

45:56.340 --> 45:59.820
That would suit these people,

45:59.820 --> 46:02.180
that would serve these people right, I think.

46:02.180 --> 46:04.300
If that's what they discovered.

46:04.300 --> 46:05.140
You guys are-

46:05.140 --> 46:08.020
I actually, this year I invented something new for Easter

46:08.020 --> 46:12.180
and it's called a solo solitaire egg hunt.

46:12.180 --> 46:14.980
What you do is you take a couple Ambien

46:14.980 --> 46:16.980
and then you hide some eggs

46:16.980 --> 46:18.140
and then you wake up

46:18.140 --> 46:20.220
and you try and remember where you put them eggs.

46:20.220 --> 46:21.700
That's pretty good.

46:21.700 --> 46:25.540
The sweet veil of Ambien has been lifted from your eyes.

46:25.540 --> 46:27.980
You go searching Memento style for your-

46:27.980 --> 46:30.060
And inside the eggs, more Ambien.

46:30.060 --> 46:31.300
Everybody wins.

46:31.300 --> 46:32.380
Have a great night.

46:32.380 --> 46:33.780
Happy birthday, Jesus.

46:33.780 --> 46:35.140
Maybe fill it with lube.

46:38.420 --> 46:40.620
Hey, I found your, ah, fuck.

46:40.620 --> 46:42.020
Oh no.

46:42.020 --> 46:43.140
What did you do?

46:43.140 --> 46:44.300
You're saying loose lube.

46:44.300 --> 46:45.140
Not like a one-

46:45.140 --> 46:45.980
I'm saying loose lube-

46:45.980 --> 46:47.980
Not like a one shot, like a-

46:47.980 --> 46:50.700
I'm saying when they open it,

46:50.700 --> 46:53.460
I want it to look like the world's worst pinata.

46:53.460 --> 46:56.660
Just everywhere, just lube spraying.

46:56.660 --> 46:59.460
My God, there's lube everywhere.

46:59.460 --> 47:01.340
Honey, in one egg, I've hidden lube.

47:01.340 --> 47:03.620
In one egg, I just emptied out a squeeze it.

47:03.620 --> 47:06.420
And you, we gots to keep them straight.

47:07.340 --> 47:08.420
This is so important.

47:08.420 --> 47:10.620
This is a Jell-O's is in here.

47:10.620 --> 47:11.820
Enjoy.

47:11.820 --> 47:14.260
A lot of people are saying that this is distasteful.

47:14.260 --> 47:15.100
Oh yeah?

47:15.100 --> 47:16.660
Just because of the whole Jesus thing, right?

47:16.660 --> 47:17.820
The whole-

47:17.820 --> 47:19.180
It's a religious holiday.

47:19.180 --> 47:20.020
Yeah.

47:20.020 --> 47:24.220
And like, I get it, I get it, you guys.

47:24.220 --> 47:28.660
It is maybe not the intended way to spend the holiday,

47:28.660 --> 47:29.500
but-

47:29.500 --> 47:30.340
I get it.

47:30.340 --> 47:31.260
I can't, I'm so down with it.

47:31.260 --> 47:33.980
Like I'm so down with their, their pioneering.

47:33.980 --> 47:36.260
Here's my main problem with it.

47:36.260 --> 47:38.460
With all this talk of like sexy egg hunts

47:38.460 --> 47:39.580
and all this stuff,

47:39.580 --> 47:42.940
how did they bypass painting up your scrotum

47:42.940 --> 47:44.300
to look like an Easter egg?

47:45.980 --> 47:47.100
Justin, um-

47:47.100 --> 47:50.260
Yeah.

47:50.260 --> 47:51.940
What's up?

47:51.940 --> 47:56.940
What if you hid the eggs all over your body?

47:57.060 --> 47:58.020
Like, like one of those,

47:58.020 --> 47:59.700
you turn yourself into a sushi platter,

47:59.700 --> 48:01.660
you turn yourself into like a playground

48:01.660 --> 48:02.940
where you've hidden a bunch of eggs.

48:02.940 --> 48:04.260
A wonderland, perhaps.

48:04.260 --> 48:07.780
A wonderland of eggs, of hidden, hidden away eggs.

48:09.020 --> 48:10.180
I mean-

48:10.180 --> 48:13.700
I just looked in your armpit,

48:13.700 --> 48:16.860
checked right between your butt cheeks.

48:16.860 --> 48:18.220
Right?

48:18.220 --> 48:20.900
Hey, lift up these, lift up these fat boobs.

48:20.900 --> 48:23.820
Bound to be one behind your knees.

48:23.820 --> 48:25.620
Your body is an egg hunt.

48:31.020 --> 48:34.500
Looking inside your ear canal.

48:35.580 --> 48:36.780
Body is an egg hunt.

48:39.340 --> 48:40.580
Oh Christ.

48:41.860 --> 48:43.980
Put a condom in that egg, you silly.

48:43.980 --> 48:45.220
Silly, it's easy.

48:45.220 --> 48:48.140
Hey, I wanna hear Griffin's last question.

48:48.140 --> 48:50.540
But first, a few quick housekeeping things.

48:50.540 --> 48:52.260
Again, thank you to everybody who came out to Chicago.

48:52.260 --> 48:53.220
It was a great time.

48:53.220 --> 48:55.780
Sorry we got the episode up late afterwards.

48:55.780 --> 48:58.420
It was kind of out of our hands.

48:58.420 --> 49:00.140
But hopefully this one will be on time.

49:00.140 --> 49:02.100
I was drunk for four days after that show.

49:02.100 --> 49:03.540
We were drunk for four days afterwards.

49:03.540 --> 49:04.380
And if you missed it,

49:04.380 --> 49:07.900
if you go back through the NBNB AM Twitter feed,

49:07.900 --> 49:12.060
we have a link to a video that was shot of the live show.

49:12.060 --> 49:12.900
So check that out. There might even be one

49:12.900 --> 49:15.580
with better audio with the actual live show audio.

49:15.580 --> 49:17.260
And if you go back through Travis's Twitter feed,

49:17.260 --> 49:20.140
you can see a picture taken of me after the live show

49:20.140 --> 49:22.060
that I do not remember.

49:22.060 --> 49:23.580
Do not recall being snapped.

49:23.580 --> 49:24.420
I don't remember the shutter.

49:24.420 --> 49:25.940
When you were having intimate dude kisses.

49:25.940 --> 49:27.620
Snapping up on me.

49:28.820 --> 49:32.860
If you wanna hear more of our show, it's NBNBAM.com.

49:32.860 --> 49:34.100
There's all kinds of episodes there.

49:34.100 --> 49:36.700
There's the methods of asking us questions there.

49:38.060 --> 49:39.780
We'd love it if you subscribed to us on iTunes,

49:39.780 --> 49:43.060
give us a rating, a review,

49:43.060 --> 49:45.380
tell your friends to listen to the show.

49:45.380 --> 49:48.980
You don't want them to die without us tonight.

49:48.980 --> 49:52.460
And you're the only one who can stand between that.

49:52.460 --> 49:54.180
Those two things happening.

49:54.180 --> 49:55.700
That thing that we just said.

49:55.700 --> 49:58.140
My BIM BAM will stop your friends from dying.

49:58.140 --> 49:58.980
That's what that phrase is.

49:58.980 --> 49:59.980
My BIM BAM will make your friends live forever.

49:59.980 --> 50:02.940
My BIM BAM at Maximumfun.org.

50:02.940 --> 50:04.220
We need your questions.

50:04.220 --> 50:05.500
We were a little light this week.

50:05.500 --> 50:07.660
If you had one that you thought was pretty good

50:07.660 --> 50:12.180
and we never broached it, send it again.

50:12.180 --> 50:14.980
We only get to a few questions per show.

50:14.980 --> 50:17.380
So, you know.

50:17.380 --> 50:19.260
As long as it's not scatological

50:19.260 --> 50:21.460
or masturbatorial in nature.

50:21.460 --> 50:24.060
Yeah, except in the sense that all of our show

50:24.060 --> 50:25.420
is masturbatorial in nature.

50:25.420 --> 50:27.180
But I mean, other than that.

50:27.180 --> 50:30.460
We were just talking about Easter egg vaginas.

50:30.460 --> 50:31.380
Yeah.

50:31.380 --> 50:33.420
How do you not jerk it to that?

50:33.420 --> 50:38.420
Not, tote bags should be arriving now-ish.

50:39.420 --> 50:42.280
If you are a donor who got one of those.

50:42.280 --> 50:45.500
Other goodies should be arriving the next two weeks or so.

50:45.500 --> 50:46.960
If you're a Maximum Fun donor.

50:46.960 --> 50:48.380
So keep an eye out.

50:48.380 --> 50:51.640
My tote bag came and it was full of money.

50:51.640 --> 50:52.480
Oh yeah?

50:52.480 --> 50:54.060
Just like chock full of bills.

50:54.060 --> 50:54.900
Shoo.

50:54.900 --> 50:56.340
I feel bad for anybody who didn't get one of those.

50:56.340 --> 50:57.180
Yeah, me too.

50:58.540 --> 51:00.100
You're so rich.

51:00.100 --> 51:00.940
Griffin.

51:00.940 --> 51:02.460
We got any shout outs?

51:02.460 --> 51:03.820
Oh yeah, shout outs.

51:03.820 --> 51:06.300
What's going on on the, oh yeah, Twitter.

51:06.300 --> 51:11.300
If you can tweet about our show with the M-B-A-M ribbon.

51:11.540 --> 51:13.920
S Diesel has had his Twibbin,

51:13.920 --> 51:15.980
his My Brother, My Brother, Me Twibbin.

51:15.980 --> 51:17.280
Are we trending yet?

51:17.280 --> 51:18.700
Are we trending?

51:18.700 --> 51:19.740
How's the trip?

51:19.740 --> 51:20.660
Your Muse.

51:20.660 --> 51:23.420
They're mostly Easter based.

51:23.420 --> 51:26.680
Of herself with scraps.

51:26.680 --> 51:28.580
Charlene519 got her tote bag.

51:28.580 --> 51:29.420
She was excited.

51:29.420 --> 51:32.700
Mr. Whalen just got Jess on the My Brother, My Brother,

51:32.700 --> 51:34.980
Me train and she had a jolly good laugh,

51:34.980 --> 51:37.700
whatever that means in foreign language, I understand.

51:37.700 --> 51:41.360
I've seen a lot of photos of people with their tote bags

51:41.360 --> 51:43.700
and they were putting cats and dogs in them

51:43.700 --> 51:44.740
and carrying them around.

51:44.740 --> 51:46.460
Not sure how I feel about that.

51:46.460 --> 51:47.740
I like it.

51:47.740 --> 51:50.900
That dog or cat can't be comfortable though, can it?

51:50.900 --> 51:53.460
I think it's the most comfortable, my problem.

51:53.460 --> 51:57.520
Can I get a JPEG of a dog and a cat in the same bag?

51:57.520 --> 51:59.920
Can somebody JPEG that for me?

51:59.920 --> 52:02.440
I don't want any old ass dogs or old ass cats either.

52:02.440 --> 52:04.760
I want young blood, I want that young stuff.

52:04.760 --> 52:07.260
I would also like a picture of a dog and a cat

52:07.260 --> 52:09.040
in a hot tub together just chillin'.

52:09.040 --> 52:09.880
Just chillin'.

52:09.880 --> 52:11.360
At the bottom it says just chillin'.

52:11.360 --> 52:14.000
And then I want a JPEG of you

52:14.000 --> 52:16.480
and you've hidden an Easter egg somewhere on your body.

52:16.480 --> 52:17.320
Where is it?

52:17.320 --> 52:19.220
And send it straight to Griffin.

52:19.220 --> 52:20.060
I need that in my personal phone.

52:20.060 --> 52:20.880
Those could just go straight to Griffin.

52:20.880 --> 52:22.960
Send it to lonelyeggs at gmail.com.

52:22.960 --> 52:23.800
Griffin.

52:25.200 --> 52:26.540
What did you put in your egg?

52:26.540 --> 52:29.560
I took half an egg and it's on the tip.

52:29.560 --> 52:31.440
Griffin, please.

52:31.440 --> 52:33.200
It looks like the juggernaut.

52:33.200 --> 52:34.480
God, I'm begging you.

52:34.480 --> 52:35.320
No.

52:37.960 --> 52:39.360
Yeah, this is our final question.

52:39.360 --> 52:41.040
It was sent in by Derek Martz.

52:41.040 --> 52:42.640
Thank you, Derek.

52:42.640 --> 52:45.580
It's by Yahoo Answers user Twilight Sparkle who asks,

52:46.680 --> 52:50.520
what's wrong about being sexually attracted to Pokemon?

52:52.720 --> 52:53.880
I'm Justin McElroy.

52:53.880 --> 52:55.080
I'm Travis McElroy.

52:55.080 --> 52:56.440
I'm Griffin McElroy.

52:56.440 --> 52:57.920
It's been my brother, my brother, me.

52:57.920 --> 52:58.880
Kiss your dads.

52:58.880 --> 53:00.320
What do you wear on the lips?

53:03.840 --> 53:05.520
Keep your heart, three stacks.

53:05.520 --> 53:07.080
Keep your heart, hey.

53:07.080 --> 53:08.720
Keep your heart, three stacks.

53:08.720 --> 53:10.080
Keep your heart, man.

53:10.080 --> 53:11.720
These girls are smart, three stacks.

53:11.720 --> 53:13.400
These girls are smart.

53:13.400 --> 53:30.400
Play your part.
