00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:47.600
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother,

00:47.600 --> 00:51.360
the mean advice show for the imaginary. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

00:51.360 --> 00:58.160
I'm your middle-aged brother, Travis McElroy. And my name is Griffin McElroy,

00:58.160 --> 01:02.080
the youngest of the three brothers. The lips, the teeth,

01:02.080 --> 01:03.920
the tip of the tongue. The lips, the teeps,

01:03.920 --> 01:08.160
the teeps of the tea. I'm so excited to be here,

01:09.520 --> 01:13.840
because I've been dying to ask somebody a question about Game of Thrones,

01:13.840 --> 01:17.520
and I think you guys watched it, right? Oh, yeah.

01:18.720 --> 01:23.680
I actually, you know I'm very vocal on Facebook about how I don't watch it because of,

01:23.680 --> 01:28.960
you know, I don't like, I don't go so much for fantasy except for the fantasies of babes I have

01:28.960 --> 01:32.560
when I lift so much weights at the gym that I fall asleep.

01:32.560 --> 01:36.560
You can ask me any question, Travis, and the answer is gonna be,

01:36.560 --> 01:43.200
we the fans have had enough. Okay, well, I stopped watching about,

01:43.200 --> 01:45.680
I think it was like halfway through season three.

01:45.680 --> 01:48.240
Oh. Two and a half seasons too much,

01:48.240 --> 01:52.160
according to we the fans. So I need you to catch me up on what

01:52.160 --> 01:57.360
happened, but I don't want you to spoil anything for anybody who is going to watch it.

01:57.360 --> 02:04.400
So if you could just get me from about the middle of season three to the end of the series

02:04.400 --> 02:07.680
without spoiling anything for the people at home, that would be great.

02:07.680 --> 02:11.200
Right, just sort of broad strokes. Yeah, just broad stroke it for me.

02:11.200 --> 02:16.160
Okay, well, I'll tell you this much, Trav. Uh-huh.

02:16.160 --> 02:19.840
For a song of ice and fire, there sure wasn't very much singing being done.

02:19.840 --> 02:24.560
Okay, that's why. Let me write that. I'll slow down. I have to write it down.

02:24.560 --> 02:27.360
There were like 80 episodes or something in this piece of shit,

02:27.360 --> 02:31.760
and as far as I can remember, there was only like one scene with singing in it.

02:31.760 --> 02:34.960
So George, don't call it what you're gonna call it.

02:34.960 --> 02:38.480
I would disagree with you there, because you didn't call it songs of ice and fire.

02:38.480 --> 02:41.760
You said there was one scene with singing. Ah, fuck, you're right. Fuck, you got me.

02:41.760 --> 02:46.320
All right, idiots, here's the thing. Ed Sheeran in it.

02:46.320 --> 02:49.280
And he didn't sing, which is like his whole thing.

02:49.280 --> 02:53.840
Drummer from Coldplay in it. He was in it?

02:53.840 --> 02:57.920
Sigur Ros from Friends. Uh-huh.

02:57.920 --> 03:00.720
He's in it. Ross from Friends is in it?

03:00.720 --> 03:04.400
Sigur Ros from Friends. Are these problems for you?

03:04.400 --> 03:06.160
I've sort of lost the plot on where you're approaching it.

03:06.160 --> 03:10.320
Chris Stapleton is a country singer. He in it. Okay.

03:10.320 --> 03:15.360
Is that making you mad, though? Aaron Rodgers in it.

03:15.360 --> 03:18.240
So we the fans, do we like that or do we not like that?

03:18.240 --> 03:22.400
We the fans are fed up and we've had enough.

03:22.400 --> 03:27.680
This is my petition. It's an audio petition.

03:27.680 --> 03:30.320
Now, several hundred episodes in the making.

03:30.320 --> 03:35.600
It is an audio petition that I am submitting for Game of Thrones.

03:35.600 --> 03:39.200
To what? Do it again. To do the whole show again.

03:39.200 --> 03:42.080
To do it again. Like a reboot or just start all over?

03:42.080 --> 03:45.840
Yes, start all over with a fresh take. Some of the things

03:45.840 --> 03:51.600
will be the same. The cool shit. Okay, so keep the good stuff.

03:51.600 --> 03:58.080
If you remember during my extensive, extensive sardonic

03:58.080 --> 04:01.680
recap podcast, Lame of Thrones, and then in every episode

04:01.680 --> 04:06.240
in the, I call it the roundup, at the end of every episode,

04:06.240 --> 04:10.480
okay, there was one fucking cool shit thing.

04:10.480 --> 04:13.040
Those are the things that should remain the same.

04:13.040 --> 04:17.600
All of the things should change. Yeah, there were like three times

04:17.600 --> 04:22.080
throughout the series where a dude's skull just got fully fucking crushed

04:22.080 --> 04:25.600
by a big man's hands. So super cut that shit together.

04:25.600 --> 04:28.720
That's the series for all the skull crushing.

04:28.720 --> 04:33.040
As I said earlier, I've been out of touch with the fans for a while now.

04:33.040 --> 04:36.400
Yeah, we the fans miss you, by the way. Oh, I'll come back.

04:36.400 --> 04:40.080
Is it that you the fans want it to be sillier or?

04:40.080 --> 04:48.320
Hell yeah, and fucking sexier, and more ads. That's the main fucking problem.

04:48.320 --> 04:52.880
I can't even get up to use this shitter because this shit doesn't take a break.

04:52.880 --> 04:56.640
Oh, I thought you meant like native advertising.

04:56.640 --> 05:02.320
Obviously, I love these dragons as much as I love flaming hot Cheetos.

05:02.320 --> 05:05.440
They for sure already have the native advertising thing covered in real

05:05.440 --> 05:08.400
as Game of Thrones. So let's, I'll delete that joke.

05:08.400 --> 05:11.280
The circle gets the square. There's a little two on the nose for my taste.

05:11.280 --> 05:14.880
What do you mean? There's a scene in Game of Thrones where they're driving

05:14.880 --> 05:18.560
a Ford truck across the icy wasteland?

05:18.560 --> 05:21.200
Well, no, the Starbucks cup was very funny.

05:21.200 --> 05:24.960
It wasn't from Starbucks. We the fans thought it was from Starbucks,

05:24.960 --> 05:28.160
and then we the fans learned it's from a local coffee shop.

05:28.160 --> 05:32.560
And also my queen, Dany, doesn't drink it. She drinks herbal tea.

05:32.560 --> 05:37.040
She gets to be in the reboot, but doing more cool shit.

05:37.040 --> 05:42.400
And she didn't have no powers. She couldn't get burned up by dragons,

05:42.400 --> 05:46.560
and she had dragons, and that's good. But she's gonna have powers in the new one.

05:46.560 --> 05:49.280
Bad ass. Which ones? Bad ass, dude.

05:49.280 --> 05:55.760
Uh, fucking lasers, invis, psychic blasts, plasma blades.

05:55.760 --> 05:59.200
Yes. All of them, dude. She's got all the powers.

05:59.200 --> 06:02.080
Yeah, she can give the powers to other people, healing factor.

06:02.080 --> 06:05.120
All right, let's get some, let's put some ink on the fucking page now, okay?

06:05.120 --> 06:09.520
Because episode one, these two brothers, sister, they're boinking big time.

06:09.520 --> 06:12.400
I would change that, by the way. I would make them not related.

06:12.400 --> 06:16.240
Yeah, that's shit nasty. Get that shit right out.

06:16.240 --> 06:18.080
But I think it would be a lot more approachable

06:18.080 --> 06:20.000
if they were just like friends who were bonus.

06:20.000 --> 06:24.720
It was so fucking gross that the people, and so lazy and sloppy,

06:24.720 --> 06:28.880
that the people what done wrote the book, George, I think the guy's name is,

06:28.880 --> 06:32.640
he didn't even realize that the same people he had screwing

06:32.640 --> 06:36.000
when the little boy went to the window to enjoy it,

06:36.000 --> 06:39.600
the same people he had screwing were also the brother and sister from earlier.

06:39.600 --> 06:42.960
Are you kidding me? Yeah, that was just sloppy writing.

06:42.960 --> 06:46.400
My sympathies to the careers of the TV show,

06:46.400 --> 06:50.160
because they had to abide by that garbage, it's like so embarrassing.

06:50.160 --> 06:53.680
I would also, in order, if I were going to rewrite the show,

06:53.680 --> 06:58.320
along with making it sillier, I would make all the sex that happens in it

06:58.320 --> 07:02.080
way more consensual. Yeah, for sure.

07:02.080 --> 07:05.360
That's so fucking badass. That part's badass.

07:05.360 --> 07:07.040
So they're boinking on this tower, right?

07:07.040 --> 07:08.560
And they're boinking and they're not related.

07:08.560 --> 07:11.120
They're just like friends, but they shouldn't be boinking

07:11.120 --> 07:14.480
because they have other things going on.

07:14.480 --> 07:16.640
They're late for a dinner date and they're boinking

07:16.640 --> 07:19.440
and people are waiting for them because they were supposed to meet a couple.

07:19.440 --> 07:21.280
Exactly, exactly, exactly.

07:21.280 --> 07:24.640
So the boy grappling hooks up the tower and gets up in the window

07:24.640 --> 07:27.760
and is enjoying it. And he's like, cool, cool, cool.

07:27.760 --> 07:30.240
I'm a boy. I'm a little boy. I've never seen this.

07:30.240 --> 07:34.880
And then one of the couple goes over and kicks the boy so hard

07:34.880 --> 07:38.400
he goes flying out of the tower. Keep that, keep that for sure.

07:38.400 --> 07:41.840
And for that scene, we're actually going to just use the 300 kick.

07:42.480 --> 07:43.760
Yes. The kick that they do in 300.

07:43.760 --> 07:45.680
So we'll just like literally take that footage.

07:45.680 --> 07:53.280
Every character in the first episode, every character is given a coin.

07:53.280 --> 07:55.680
Yes. And they can use the coin eight times

07:55.680 --> 08:01.280
to do a 300 kick. Yes.

08:01.280 --> 08:03.840
And they get no more. Yeah.

08:04.640 --> 08:10.400
We'll have to make those eight kicks last for the entirety of the series.

08:10.400 --> 08:12.720
Yeah. Can they trade them to each other

08:12.720 --> 08:15.760
for goods and services? They can trade them to each other

08:15.760 --> 08:17.680
like in John Wick. They can trade.

08:19.600 --> 08:23.840
If you use up all your Spartan kicks, maybe you could babysit for your nephew

08:23.840 --> 08:26.160
and he'll give you one of his Spartan kicks.

08:26.720 --> 08:29.520
But those are the rules. I have one other small change.

08:31.360 --> 08:34.480
The boy goes falling in and you're like, oh no, he's dead.

08:34.480 --> 08:37.200
But then he comes up. He's on the roof of the DeLorean.

08:37.200 --> 08:40.080
Pretty badass. I love that. I love that.

08:40.080 --> 08:43.360
I was going to say Batman, but maybe Batman's driving the DeLorean.

08:43.360 --> 08:47.120
Yeah. With my queen and our queen, the fan's queen,

08:47.120 --> 08:52.800
Daenerys. Yes. And also, I don't know,

08:52.800 --> 08:56.000
maybe Captain America's there. Maybe- Stop it.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.080
Now you're making jokes. Now you're making jokes at me.

08:58.080 --> 09:00.560
Okay. Let's just go back to where Batman was driving the DeLorean

09:00.560 --> 09:03.520
and he pulls up and Bran, I think that's the name of the kid,

09:03.520 --> 09:06.080
Branflakes opens the door of the DeLorean.

09:07.040 --> 09:10.640
But this time he doesn't hit, he doesn't hit what's his face

09:11.440 --> 09:13.760
in that face. Like he just says like, hey,

09:13.760 --> 09:16.880
you accidentally kicked me off the tower. I could have died.

09:16.880 --> 09:18.960
Yeah. And they're like, oh god, I'm so sorry.

09:18.960 --> 09:21.120
I'm so sorry. You know how I get when I boink.

09:21.760 --> 09:25.280
Yeah. When I boink, I'm just flailing everywhere. Legs akimbo.

09:25.280 --> 09:28.560
They waited a really long time to put dragons in it.

09:28.560 --> 09:32.160
So I'm going to have dragons in it from the beginning,

09:32.160 --> 09:35.520
except they can talk and use ice lances. Oh, cool.

09:35.520 --> 09:38.240
Yeah. And I think there's only like three dragons.

09:38.240 --> 09:41.120
I would make there be like 500, 600 maybe, maybe more.

09:41.120 --> 09:43.360
500, 600 dragons. And they reproduce

09:43.360 --> 09:45.280
at an uncontrollable rate. Yes.

09:45.280 --> 09:48.720
Yes. All the dragons are always pregnant in this one.

09:48.720 --> 09:50.080
Yeah. And they have to be hunted

09:50.080 --> 09:51.600
to keep the population down. That's right.

09:51.600 --> 09:55.440
And I'd like to introduce a thing where in the big throne room

09:55.440 --> 09:57.840
in the Red Keep, which we're going to find a way cooler name

09:57.840 --> 10:00.880
for something like Bloodcastle Storm Mountain.

10:02.080 --> 10:04.080
Battlegetten. Battlegetten.

10:04.080 --> 10:05.520
What? Battlegetten.

10:06.320 --> 10:08.480
Battlegetten. Battlegetten.

10:08.480 --> 10:10.240
Battlegetten. Is the name of the castle?

10:10.240 --> 10:11.280
Battlegetten. Okay.

10:11.280 --> 10:14.880
The castle's called Battlegetten. And then in the throne room,

10:14.880 --> 10:18.640
there's going to be like 16 thrones. And we'll have the cool,

10:18.640 --> 10:20.480
I guess we'll have the sword one, but that shit's play.

10:20.480 --> 10:23.920
But they'll be on caster wheels and you'll, the king,

10:23.920 --> 10:27.120
whatever gets to like push them and whoever wants to fight him

10:27.120 --> 10:30.160
can like push the, and then if your throne gets knocked over

10:30.160 --> 10:32.640
or falls down the stairs, then it's out.

10:33.200 --> 10:34.320
Oh, I like that. I love that.

10:34.320 --> 10:36.640
Maybe we make the throne a little more comfortable.

10:37.200 --> 10:41.120
There will be a plush throne for sensitive bottoms.

10:41.120 --> 10:42.800
I also, and this is a little note,

10:42.800 --> 10:46.320
but I'd have the snake man beat the big rock man

10:46.320 --> 10:47.280
in that one fight.

10:48.160 --> 10:50.640
I didn't like that the snake man lost to the big rock man.

10:50.640 --> 10:53.120
But the drive his head got crushed in such a cool way.

10:53.120 --> 10:54.720
That's the one bad ass thing about this fucking show.

10:54.720 --> 10:55.760
Oh shit, you're right.

10:55.760 --> 10:57.360
The fucking cool thing that we will have.

10:57.360 --> 10:58.240
Oh no, you're right.

10:58.240 --> 11:01.040
This one's got 16 thrones, but at the beginning,

11:01.040 --> 11:04.480
there's 17 people. And then after every round,

11:04.480 --> 11:06.720
they remove one of the thrones.

11:06.720 --> 11:08.560
That's an important game mechanic. Yeah.

11:08.560 --> 11:10.560
And if you, again, if you fall down the stairs

11:10.560 --> 11:12.640
and that you'd get our shoulder out.

11:12.640 --> 11:15.920
If singer Ross plays and then eventually they stop playing,

11:15.920 --> 11:18.560
it could take anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours.

11:18.560 --> 11:19.520
But when they stop playing,

11:19.520 --> 11:21.280
everybody tries to get into a throne.

11:21.280 --> 11:24.240
And then they, whoever doesn't have one is eliminated by blood.

11:24.240 --> 11:25.760
Yes. I love this.

11:26.480 --> 11:27.520
It's good, right?

11:27.520 --> 11:30.960
It's unlike, I guess we the people just need,

11:31.520 --> 11:36.240
and we the fans need, if HBO would just sign off on it

11:36.240 --> 11:41.920
or respond to our emails and tweets and tumblers and stuff.

11:41.920 --> 11:43.840
Oh, sorry, one more tiny note.

11:44.560 --> 11:47.840
I was gonna say more wolves, but what if they're all wolves?

11:48.640 --> 11:50.240
What if they all have the ability?

11:50.240 --> 11:52.480
I thought, oh, there's a separate coin.

11:52.480 --> 11:53.680
There's a second coin.

11:53.680 --> 11:55.600
There's a second coin.

11:56.960 --> 11:59.520
Yes, there's a second coin that allows you to transform

11:59.520 --> 12:01.440
into a werewolf 17 times.

12:01.440 --> 12:01.680
Yes.

12:01.680 --> 12:04.640
And you can all, that's all you get for the whole TV show.

12:04.640 --> 12:04.960
Yes.

12:04.960 --> 12:09.200
So don't burn one as a joke unless it's gonna be hysterical.

12:09.200 --> 12:11.280
Yeah, if it's a really good joke, maybe.

12:11.280 --> 12:12.640
If it's so funny.

12:12.640 --> 12:15.120
Also, I would like to be a character in it.

12:15.120 --> 12:16.720
I would not like to play a character in it.

12:16.720 --> 12:17.360
Let me be clear.

12:17.360 --> 12:20.080
I, Travis McElroy, would like to be a character in it.

12:20.080 --> 12:24.400
Joe Mangiello plays Travis McElroy in Game of Thrones II.

12:24.400 --> 12:25.120
They back.

12:25.120 --> 12:26.640
I wanna make a cameo.

12:26.640 --> 12:29.760
I wouldn't mind squashing Ed Sheeran's melon.

12:29.760 --> 12:30.640
Hey, listen to this.

12:31.440 --> 12:32.320
Hey, listen to this.

12:32.320 --> 12:34.080
Here's your poster right here.

12:34.880 --> 12:35.760
Here's the poster.

12:36.640 --> 12:39.040
There's 500 to 600 dragons.

12:39.040 --> 12:44.240
Ed Sheeran, Sigur Ros, Aaron Rodgers, all in armor, loving it.

12:44.240 --> 12:46.960
The one guy is beating the other guy.

12:46.960 --> 12:48.560
But on the other side of the poster,

12:49.200 --> 12:51.360
it goes the way it did originally.

12:51.360 --> 12:53.360
So both of those are depicted.

12:53.360 --> 12:54.800
Just side by side?

12:54.800 --> 12:57.920
In the series, both outcomes are depicted.

12:57.920 --> 12:59.200
Choose your own adventure.

12:59.200 --> 13:00.320
Yeah, both of them happen.

13:00.320 --> 13:01.840
It's a little bit for everyone.

13:01.840 --> 13:03.440
Yeah, both of them happen in it.

13:03.440 --> 13:04.880
And they all win.

13:04.880 --> 13:06.720
And everybody wins in this one.

13:06.720 --> 13:09.200
And in this one, and then at the bottom of the poster, it says,

13:09.200 --> 13:15.200
let the games begin, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, again.

13:16.960 --> 13:18.080
It's good, right?

13:18.080 --> 13:22.880
Let the games again, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, again.

13:22.880 --> 13:23.280
Yes.

13:23.280 --> 13:24.080
Fuck.

13:24.080 --> 13:24.400
Yes.

13:25.360 --> 13:26.080
It's back.

13:26.080 --> 13:26.880
Let's do a question.

13:27.600 --> 13:28.480
Yeah, I love that.

13:28.480 --> 13:29.200
Thank you, Griffin.

13:29.920 --> 13:31.840
I'm sorry I got a little lost.

13:31.840 --> 13:34.640
I'm in the doctor's office waiting room.

13:34.640 --> 13:38.720
They just called my name, but someone else got up and went back.

13:38.720 --> 13:39.520
Oh, man.

13:39.520 --> 13:40.880
I can't imagine that.

13:40.880 --> 13:43.840
Now it's been 20 minutes, and I'm the only one left in the waiting room,

13:43.840 --> 13:47.040
except an old woman who was parked by the nurse's door to yell at everyone

13:47.040 --> 13:49.040
who goes in before her, you don't look sick.

13:49.760 --> 13:53.040
Do I go tell them they made a mistake?

13:53.040 --> 13:54.320
What if they're just busy?

13:54.320 --> 13:57.440
How long do I wait before I become the same as this old woman?

13:57.440 --> 13:59.040
I live here now, I suppose.

13:59.040 --> 14:00.400
That's from Darned and Diver.

14:00.400 --> 14:04.960
This feels like a piece of paper you find crammed

14:04.960 --> 14:07.440
between two stones in the doctor's office.

14:07.440 --> 14:07.840
Yeah.

14:08.960 --> 14:14.320
That's so hard because it's really hard living in a society,

14:14.320 --> 14:17.840
we can all accept that, it's a common theme of our program,

14:17.840 --> 14:23.280
but it's especially hard when it just, it very clearly broke down on everyone.

14:23.280 --> 14:23.760
Yes.

14:23.760 --> 14:27.760
We can all agree that it broke down, and I don't know how you get out of that.

14:27.760 --> 14:31.600
When it's hard to admit to another person in the machine,

14:31.600 --> 14:35.760
like, hey, the machine's broke, and there's no recompense for that.

14:35.760 --> 14:37.120
There's no way out of it.

14:37.120 --> 14:40.480
This fear that I will infer here that you're feeling,

14:40.480 --> 14:44.560
because I have felt this many times, this fear of like walking up and say,

14:44.560 --> 14:46.080
oh, I think there's been a mistake.

14:46.080 --> 14:49.120
I think I was, and they're like, no, there's no mistake.

14:49.120 --> 14:50.080
You'll be back soon.

14:50.080 --> 14:51.520
Just sit back down.

14:51.520 --> 14:52.020
100%.

14:52.020 --> 14:58.580
Oh, God, there's no doubt in my mind that it's 100% verbatim tone and everything.

14:58.580 --> 14:59.620
They would sound like my brother.

14:59.620 --> 15:03.060
That's how sure I am that that is the exact response you would get.

15:03.060 --> 15:04.020
Just sit down.

15:04.020 --> 15:07.380
We're going to call you in a minute, and you're like, oh, no, I have to go.

15:07.380 --> 15:09.220
Because it's the doctor, right?

15:09.220 --> 15:12.420
If the doctor's like, we just let anybody back there,

15:12.420 --> 15:14.980
no matter what name we call, whatever, it's all bullshit.

15:16.660 --> 15:18.260
What else are they making up, right?

15:18.260 --> 15:20.340
What else are they just pulling out of their asses?

15:20.340 --> 15:22.900
Because you would think that if they called your name,

15:22.900 --> 15:28.500
if it was like Dan and somebody else went back and they weren't Dan,

15:28.500 --> 15:32.020
that that mistake would be found out pretty quickly.

15:32.020 --> 15:34.100
Are they getting all your fungus medicine?

15:34.100 --> 15:36.020
What if there's none left for you?

15:37.300 --> 15:39.620
Because they're eating it for fuel.

15:39.620 --> 15:44.180
They're eating all your fungus medicine and smuggling it out in their bellies.

15:44.180 --> 15:44.580
Now, let me say this.

15:44.580 --> 15:46.420
The other side of this, too, is also a bonger.

15:46.420 --> 15:48.260
That if someone calls Dan and someone's like,

15:48.260 --> 15:50.900
well, I'm Jim, but yeah, you know what?

15:50.900 --> 15:51.700
I'm going.

15:51.700 --> 15:53.380
I'm Jim, but I'm in a hurry.

15:53.380 --> 15:54.340
I'm Jim in a hurry.

15:56.180 --> 15:59.460
Flip side, there are worse places to live now.

15:59.460 --> 16:00.660
There are worse places to live.

16:00.660 --> 16:03.460
If you have a whoopsie, uh-oh, you're very close to somebody

16:03.460 --> 16:06.180
who can patch that right up for you, I hope.

16:06.180 --> 16:07.940
And all the highlights, magazines you can read.

16:07.940 --> 16:08.900
All the highlights you can read.

16:08.900 --> 16:10.660
There's the goldfish, probably.

16:10.660 --> 16:15.140
And then you have all those beads that you can push around on the little pipes.

16:15.140 --> 16:16.500
Gosh, those are freaking fun.

16:16.500 --> 16:18.980
The hospital Sid works at has killer bacon.

16:19.540 --> 16:19.940
Yeah.

16:19.940 --> 16:26.020
And apparently, you have a new friend in a, sounds like very judgmental old woman.

16:26.020 --> 16:26.820
Yeah, let's get there.

16:26.820 --> 16:27.300
Let's get there.

16:27.300 --> 16:27.940
Let's get to her.

16:28.660 --> 16:30.500
Okay, what is she doing?

16:30.500 --> 16:31.780
You don't look sick.

16:31.780 --> 16:32.900
That sucks.

16:32.900 --> 16:34.180
Well, it might be a compliment.

16:35.140 --> 16:39.060
It might be like, hey, I want you to know you probably feel really bad right now.

16:39.060 --> 16:41.700
And oh, thank God you came in to take care of yourself.

16:41.700 --> 16:43.540
I, listen, I appreciate it.

16:43.540 --> 16:45.140
I'm sure all your loved ones appreciate it.

16:45.140 --> 16:48.580
I want you to know, in case you were worried about it, you don't look sick.

16:48.580 --> 16:50.340
You look, you're not showing it.

16:50.340 --> 16:51.460
You look great.

16:52.020 --> 16:52.740
You look great.

16:52.740 --> 16:53.700
I hope you get better.

16:53.700 --> 16:56.900
Because I understand that sometimes illness is invisible.

16:56.900 --> 16:59.460
And I hope, I'm glad you've taken care of yourself.

17:00.260 --> 17:01.380
This old woman is great.

17:02.020 --> 17:02.820
Yeah, she's good.

17:02.820 --> 17:04.420
I have to, yeah, I'm with Trav.

17:04.420 --> 17:05.540
This one kicks ass.

17:05.540 --> 17:10.180
Did you think that maybe she was a bad egg maybe for a little bit?

17:10.180 --> 17:14.340
When you originally thought about it wrong, did you think that maybe she was kind of a bad egg?

17:14.340 --> 17:18.980
Yeah, like the pigeon lady in Home Alone 2.

17:18.980 --> 17:21.140
You can't just start talking about Home Alone.

17:21.140 --> 17:22.740
But I'm just saying, like when you first,

17:22.740 --> 17:26.100
because Kevin first sees her and he's like, oh no, she's a bad end.

17:26.100 --> 17:28.740
But then by the end, it's like, oh no, she's actually very sweet.

17:28.740 --> 17:31.700
Right, at the end when she kills two men by throwing a bird seed at them.

17:31.700 --> 17:33.540
Have a question from Yahoo.

17:34.420 --> 17:35.460
I love that Gryff.

17:35.460 --> 17:36.660
Here's one sent in by Graham.

17:36.660 --> 17:37.540
Roboc, thanks, Graham.

17:37.540 --> 17:39.060
It's a non, it's, no, I'm sorry.

17:39.060 --> 17:41.700
It's Yahoo Answers user Sebastian.

17:41.700 --> 17:50.020
Sebastian asks, how to make boiled eggs smell bad quickly for school.

17:50.820 --> 17:52.420
Huh, whoa.

17:52.420 --> 17:55.940
I have to take care of a boiled egg for a week and I broke it.

17:55.940 --> 18:00.340
So now I'm trying to make another one and it needs to smell bad so it's more believable.

18:01.540 --> 18:02.040
Why?

18:03.060 --> 18:03.780
For school.

18:04.820 --> 18:09.860
No, I understand, but is the question asker saying because I've had it for a week,

18:09.860 --> 18:12.500
it should smell like a week old boiled egg?

18:12.500 --> 18:13.060
Yes.

18:13.060 --> 18:13.780
Yes, Travis.

18:13.780 --> 18:14.340
Yes, Travis.

18:14.340 --> 18:15.220
I'm just wanting to make sure.

18:15.220 --> 18:18.100
I didn't even think that part was particularly complex or nuanced.

18:19.860 --> 18:23.860
But that would imply that this question asker is afraid that when they turn in this fake

18:23.860 --> 18:29.380
boiled egg, this faux boiled egg, that the teacher is going to smell it.

18:29.380 --> 18:32.020
Yeah, your teacher is going to get that egg and be like, oh, that's fine.

18:32.020 --> 18:33.380
You can put it in the trash.

18:33.380 --> 18:34.980
Good work keeping it not cracked.

18:34.980 --> 18:35.380
Unless.

18:36.180 --> 18:36.740
Unless.

18:36.740 --> 18:39.940
Unless the teacher is a nasty.

18:39.940 --> 18:40.440
Oh.

18:41.380 --> 18:42.420
Give me that stink.

18:44.420 --> 18:45.620
Would you name your son?

18:45.620 --> 18:46.500
Yeah, it's Kenneth.

18:46.500 --> 18:48.420
Give me that stink, Kenneth.

18:48.420 --> 18:50.020
Give me that stinky egg.

18:50.020 --> 18:51.780
This one doesn't stink at all.

18:51.780 --> 18:52.900
No points.

18:52.900 --> 18:57.540
You know, now that Griffin said it, I cannot think of another reason that a teacher would

18:57.540 --> 19:02.980
think assigning you to take care of an egg for a week is anything.

19:02.980 --> 19:07.940
Yeah, you can bury that shit in a hole in your yard and then dig him up one week later.

19:07.940 --> 19:09.300
Here he is safe and sound probably.

19:09.940 --> 19:10.740
I had to do it.

19:11.700 --> 19:13.780
Yes, but what did it prove, Justin?

19:13.780 --> 19:15.540
It proved that I was ready to be a father.

19:18.660 --> 19:19.300
It is not.

19:19.300 --> 19:22.100
Can I say that is the object of the lesson, right?

19:22.100 --> 19:23.620
It's hard to be a parent.

19:23.620 --> 19:24.900
Here's an egg to take care of.

19:24.900 --> 19:26.820
Can you imagine how hard this would be?

19:26.820 --> 19:28.500
One of the two things is going to happen.

19:28.500 --> 19:32.740
One is the kid's going to do a pretty good job and be like, I'm ready to be a dad.

19:32.740 --> 19:34.820
I'm a very responsible 15-year-old.

19:34.820 --> 19:35.860
That egg looks beautiful.

19:35.860 --> 19:36.820
I'm ready to be a dad.

19:38.180 --> 19:38.740
That's one option.

19:38.740 --> 19:44.100
The other one is, like, the other problem with this is it is nothing like that.

19:44.100 --> 19:45.620
It's nothing like it.

19:45.620 --> 19:50.900
Because I can take an egg home and put it in my sock drawer, grab it a week later, and

19:50.900 --> 19:52.820
turn it in and be like, yeah, I took it everywhere.

19:52.820 --> 19:53.700
I took care of it.

19:53.700 --> 19:55.700
But I can't do that with BB.

19:55.700 --> 19:57.060
Can't do it with him.

19:57.060 --> 20:01.380
Well, on the inverse, you could have a kid who drops their boiled egg and it explodes

20:01.380 --> 20:02.660
when it hits the ground.

20:02.660 --> 20:05.460
And then, you know, a few years later, somebody's like, you ever think about having kids?

20:05.460 --> 20:08.180
And it's like, well, no, because I know if I did have one, I would drop it.

20:08.180 --> 20:10.100
It would explode as soon as it hit the ground.

20:10.100 --> 20:14.100
So maybe if a kid wouldn't explode, we probably shouldn't drop them.

20:14.100 --> 20:17.380
Maybe taking care of an egg is harder than taking care of a baby.

20:18.020 --> 20:20.740
Okay, because babies can recover from a drop or two.

20:20.740 --> 20:25.860
Yeah, I'm saying my baby is surprisingly tougher than an egg.

20:25.860 --> 20:29.060
There is also the problem of like, if you get really hungry while you're watching your

20:29.060 --> 20:32.740
child, it's probably not going to occur to you to scarf it.

20:33.620 --> 20:34.740
It probably won't think to scarf the child.

20:34.740 --> 20:38.420
And if you do, you face way stronger punishment than just like an F.

20:39.700 --> 20:45.300
So I guess while you're handing it to them, do a quick burp or fart right on it.

20:48.020 --> 20:48.980
Here's what I would do.

20:48.980 --> 20:50.660
I would put it in vinegar overnight.

20:50.660 --> 20:57.780
The acid of the vinegar is going to break down some of the shell.

20:57.780 --> 21:03.140
That's why we use vinegar when we're helping to color eggs, because they break down some

21:03.140 --> 21:04.420
of the proteins in the shell.

21:04.420 --> 21:05.860
So put it into vinegar.

21:05.860 --> 21:08.820
It's going to break down some of the shell, and it's going to absorb some of that vinegar

21:08.820 --> 21:13.460
smell, and it's going to have a real gnarly stink on it, like a real rough stink.

21:13.460 --> 21:15.380
Are you worried that that might go the other way, though?

21:15.380 --> 21:20.020
That when you turn it, it's like, hey, I'm glad you, I guess, kept your baby alive, quote unquote.

21:20.020 --> 21:22.260
But also, why your baby stinks so bad?

21:24.020 --> 21:26.340
If you have a stinky egg, that's out of your control.

21:27.300 --> 21:27.940
That's true.

21:29.060 --> 21:30.660
Take it up with the chicken, my man.

21:30.660 --> 21:32.100
I don't know what to tell you.

21:32.100 --> 21:35.140
Ask the chicken's stinky ass why it makes such bad eggs.

21:35.860 --> 21:38.340
I'm just playing with the cards I was dealt, chief.

21:38.340 --> 21:41.060
Yeah, this is the chicken's ass, not mine.

21:41.060 --> 21:42.740
It's your nasty assignment, Devin.

21:45.700 --> 21:47.220
I'll see you Fortnite later.

21:47.220 --> 21:50.660
I can't, please, it's Mr. Pearson.

21:50.660 --> 21:54.980
I will see you on Fortnite later, but please, it is Mr. Pearson at school.

21:54.980 --> 21:55.860
Fuck off, Devin.

21:56.420 --> 21:58.660
Okay, you're the boss.

21:58.660 --> 22:03.620
Another option is you can rub the egg up against your mama's feet.

22:09.300 --> 22:10.660
You just got scorch mode.

22:12.740 --> 22:13.240
Boom.

22:13.240 --> 22:19.720
About three years ago, a colleague and I created a presentation for some high school students on

22:19.720 --> 22:21.560
behalf of the college where I work.

22:21.560 --> 22:25.160
The presentation involved handing out little pieces of dark chocolate.

22:25.160 --> 22:28.200
My then boss, who had a company credit card, bought the chocolate.

22:28.200 --> 22:32.120
We ended up with a lot left over, but I kept it in my office in case we ever did the presentation

22:32.120 --> 22:32.840
again.

22:32.840 --> 22:38.040
Well, now it's 2019 and I still have a bag of chocolate in my office that realistically

22:38.040 --> 22:39.560
is never going to be used.

22:39.560 --> 22:44.200
Neither my boss nor the other person involved in the project works here anymore, so no one

22:44.200 --> 22:45.560
else even knows they exist.

22:45.560 --> 22:49.800
The chocolates, when unwrapped, have a thin dusty whiteness to suggest they are past their

22:49.800 --> 22:50.120
prime.

22:52.120 --> 22:57.960
I eat them occasionally, should I stop and save them for a future use that might never

22:57.960 --> 22:58.600
come?

22:58.600 --> 23:00.760
That's from the cocoa monster in Canada.

23:00.760 --> 23:01.560
Holy shit.

23:01.560 --> 23:06.520
I love that when you say, should I stop, the reason is to save them for some future use

23:06.520 --> 23:09.320
and not that they're over three years old.

23:09.320 --> 23:10.360
That they're molting.

23:11.480 --> 23:14.920
That white dust, before anybody tweets it, I believe it's called bloom.

23:14.920 --> 23:18.280
And it's a thing that if you see it on there, it means you're not going to be able to temper

23:18.280 --> 23:18.760
that chocolate.

23:18.760 --> 23:19.800
It's not going to melt right.

23:19.800 --> 23:21.320
It's not going to temper well.

23:21.320 --> 23:23.240
But I don't think it means that it's bad.

23:24.600 --> 23:26.760
I mean, I bet it has a bad taste of it.

23:26.760 --> 23:30.200
The flavor to it, I mean, it seems like that part would be bad.

23:30.200 --> 23:33.880
And it seems like, I don't know what role the chocolate played in the presentation.

23:33.880 --> 23:36.440
Again, a vital piece of context.

23:36.440 --> 23:38.920
People, you have to tell us these things.

23:38.920 --> 23:39.960
We can't just guess.

23:39.960 --> 23:44.040
But I assume the chocolate was meant to be a positive, right?

23:44.040 --> 23:49.720
The chocolate in the presentation is a net reward, I would assume, and not a negative.

23:49.720 --> 23:50.520
Oh, you got it wrong.

23:50.520 --> 23:52.120
Eat this old ass dusty chocolate.

23:52.120 --> 23:56.200
Eat this old fucking baseball card chocolate.

23:56.200 --> 23:57.960
This foul chocolate.

23:57.960 --> 24:03.800
I do like this ambition scenario, though, where you surreptitiously scarf all the chocolate.

24:03.800 --> 24:07.640
And then six months from now, your new boss is like, I remember

24:07.640 --> 24:10.600
when I traded over this job with the old boss.

24:10.600 --> 24:13.400
They handed me a file folder that had very important information.

24:13.400 --> 24:15.560
And on one piece of paper was just written, you know,

24:15.560 --> 24:19.640
Susan has the chocolate in case we ever do the presentation again.

24:19.640 --> 24:21.240
I know it's been four years, but Susan,

24:21.240 --> 24:23.960
I assume you still have that chocolate like a responsible employee.

24:25.080 --> 24:29.320
And then you have to deal with the ramifications of Laura Scott.

24:29.320 --> 24:35.080
Yeah, I think that unless someone tells me, this is for my life.

24:35.080 --> 24:39.000
Unless someone specifically says to me, don't throw this away.

24:39.640 --> 24:43.000
I'm trying to throw shit away constantly all the time.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.560
I think it's completely valid, this idea that you would say like,

24:45.560 --> 24:48.200
oh, I threw that shit away years ago.

24:48.200 --> 24:50.040
What are you talking about?

24:50.040 --> 24:52.440
That's nonsense that you think I would still have that.

24:52.440 --> 24:52.920
No way.

24:54.200 --> 24:57.560
Yeah, your office is in a chocolate storage company, is it?

24:58.360 --> 24:58.840
Oh, wait.

24:59.880 --> 25:01.080
Unless it is shit.

25:01.080 --> 25:04.360
Okay, so now we have a hustle on our hands.

25:04.360 --> 25:06.440
People are going to walk in there and be impressed about how long

25:06.440 --> 25:08.200
you've kept your chocolate in there.

25:08.200 --> 25:11.080
And they're going to be like, well, now I know a safe place to keep my chocolate.

25:11.640 --> 25:13.080
And they turn it over to you.

25:13.080 --> 25:16.040
And then all of a sudden, snack fest.

25:17.000 --> 25:17.560
And you know what?

25:17.560 --> 25:20.280
Maybe that's how you get that big raise you've been angling for.

25:20.280 --> 25:22.120
It's when your boss comes in and is like,

25:22.120 --> 25:24.760
we're probably going to have to spend money to buy chocolate again

25:24.760 --> 25:25.880
because we're doing that.

25:25.880 --> 25:26.920
Ah, what a waste.

25:26.920 --> 25:29.000
And you're like, no, actually.

25:29.000 --> 25:33.000
Step inside my fudge-o-matorium, why don't you?

25:33.000 --> 25:36.520
Like Dr. Fratorium's fudge-o-matorium.

25:36.520 --> 25:37.560
Step inside.

25:40.040 --> 25:42.360
Lick the walls, there's choco stains all over.

25:42.360 --> 25:45.560
I see there's choco stains pretty much all over.

25:45.560 --> 25:47.080
Can't give them a fun brand name.

25:47.080 --> 25:48.920
It's pretty bad, the fudge stains.

25:49.560 --> 25:50.520
Guys, bad news.

25:51.640 --> 25:55.320
I ate all my boss's chocolate and I don't have the money to buy new stuff.

25:55.320 --> 25:56.440
Oh, let's buy some chocolate.

25:56.440 --> 26:06.600
If we're going to buy chocolate, we need money, let's go buy some.

26:10.120 --> 26:11.560
Bad news, criminals.

26:11.560 --> 26:11.880
Whoa.

26:12.600 --> 26:13.240
Yeah.

26:13.240 --> 26:15.400
Hey, all you criminals listening, I know you're like,

26:15.400 --> 26:18.600
I can look at McElroy.family and click on tours

26:18.600 --> 26:20.680
and see when Travis is going to be out of town.

26:20.680 --> 26:23.320
But bad news for you because I have ring

26:23.320 --> 26:26.520
and it's going to let me know if you try to break into my house

26:26.520 --> 26:28.840
and then you're going to prison.

26:28.840 --> 26:30.840
Yeah, also, I'm Judge Dredd.

26:30.840 --> 26:32.760
It's also important to note.

26:32.760 --> 26:35.720
And I've got a big dog and a little dog,

26:35.720 --> 26:38.520
but mostly the big dog is what matters here in this context.

26:39.160 --> 26:39.880
Because here's the thing-

26:39.880 --> 26:43.080
I'm better than a dog, I'm just offended.

26:43.080 --> 26:45.160
Because I was like, I'm Judge Dredd and I protect my brothers.

26:45.160 --> 26:46.440
And you're like, but I've got a dog.

26:46.440 --> 26:47.560
But I have a dog.

26:47.560 --> 26:52.600
No, in addition to brother Judge Dredd, brother Dredd.

26:52.600 --> 26:53.640
Now I have a big dog.

26:53.640 --> 26:55.880
Anyways, ring helps you stay connected to your home

26:55.880 --> 26:57.880
anywhere in the world thanks to HD video

26:57.880 --> 26:59.960
and two-way audio features on ring devices.

26:59.960 --> 27:02.120
It's one of my favorite things if I'm somewhere

27:02.120 --> 27:04.200
and there's like someone rings my doorbell,

27:04.200 --> 27:05.320
which is a ring doorbell,

27:05.320 --> 27:07.240
or just like somebody walks up in my door,

27:07.240 --> 27:10.040
not only do I get a notification from my phone that says,

27:10.040 --> 27:11.160
hey, someone's at the door,

27:11.880 --> 27:14.680
but it also gives me a chance to see who came up

27:14.680 --> 27:17.000
even if I miss the notification,

27:17.000 --> 27:19.960
even if I miss the ringing of the doorbell.

27:19.960 --> 27:22.360
And I can talk, it's a two-way communication.

27:22.360 --> 27:24.200
I can say like, oh, you can just leave that at the door

27:24.200 --> 27:26.200
or like, no, thank you or whatever.

27:26.200 --> 27:28.440
It's a great way to answer the door

27:28.440 --> 27:29.880
even when you're not at home.

27:29.880 --> 27:31.320
I am a huge fan of it.

27:32.200 --> 27:33.720
I highly recommend it.

27:33.720 --> 27:34.840
Like I said, I have two.

27:34.840 --> 27:37.320
I have one on my front door and one on my back door.

27:39.000 --> 27:42.840
One in his Parisian villa and Dredd's all over that one too.

27:42.840 --> 27:43.880
So don't even fucking think about it.

27:43.880 --> 27:45.400
Yeah, I'm one of my Zeppelin.

27:46.040 --> 27:48.120
And if you want to check it out as a listener,

27:48.120 --> 27:49.560
we have a special offer for you

27:49.560 --> 27:52.280
on a ring starter kit available right now.

27:52.280 --> 27:55.240
With a video doorbell and motion activated floodlight cam,

27:55.240 --> 27:56.760
the starter kit has everything you need

27:56.760 --> 27:59.160
to start building a ring of security around your home.

27:59.160 --> 28:04.200
Just go to ring.com, that's R-I-N-G,.com slash my brother.

28:04.200 --> 28:06.600
That's ring.com slash my brother.

28:08.040 --> 28:09.880
Stitch Fix is the clothes one

28:09.880 --> 28:13.000
and they have decided to support us again.

28:13.000 --> 28:15.800
And so I get clothes from Stitch Fix.

28:15.800 --> 28:17.000
I get lots of them.

28:17.000 --> 28:18.120
Yeah, there it is.

28:18.120 --> 28:19.880
I get lots of them and they come in a box

28:19.880 --> 28:25.240
and they have a special person who has an eye out for me.

28:25.240 --> 28:26.680
And they're in the box.

28:27.240 --> 28:27.880
They're in the box.

28:27.880 --> 28:28.840
They pick out my clothes

28:28.840 --> 28:31.240
and then they ship themselves like a normal would do.

28:31.880 --> 28:34.600
And then I get the clothes and I try them on

28:34.600 --> 28:36.760
and if I like it, then I can keep it

28:36.760 --> 28:39.400
and they'll charge me whatever for it.

28:39.400 --> 28:42.040
And if I don't like it, just put it right back in the bag

28:42.040 --> 28:43.480
and then send that back free of charge.

28:43.480 --> 28:48.280
No, it is no skin off my nose when Stitch Fix sends me the clothes.

28:48.280 --> 28:50.760
And so I think you should do it too

28:50.760 --> 28:52.200
because I enjoy doing this a lot.

28:52.200 --> 28:53.160
Every time I get a little box,

28:53.160 --> 28:56.920
it's like a little opportunity for a fashion statement,

28:56.920 --> 28:58.280
a personal change maybe.

28:58.280 --> 29:00.040
And also I don't do laundry that often.

29:00.040 --> 29:02.920
So it's like, yes, this will get me through Friday.

29:02.920 --> 29:04.200
So that's very cool too.

29:04.200 --> 29:05.560
So I want you to get started today

29:05.560 --> 29:07.480
at stitchfix.com slash my brother

29:07.480 --> 29:09.240
and you'll get an extra 25% off

29:09.240 --> 29:11.000
when you keep all the items in your box.

29:11.000 --> 29:14.680
That's stitchfix.com slash my brother.

29:14.680 --> 29:17.640
One more time, in case you didn't pay attention just now,

29:17.640 --> 29:21.720
pay attention this time, stitchfix.com slash my brother.

29:24.040 --> 29:27.160
Welcome back to Fireside Chat on KMAX.

29:27.160 --> 29:29.000
With me in studio to take your calls

29:29.000 --> 29:31.560

29:31.560 --> 29:34.120
Oliver Wong and Morgan Rhodes.

29:34.120 --> 29:35.320
Go ahead, caller.

29:35.320 --> 29:37.640
Hey, I'm looking for a music podcast

29:37.640 --> 29:39.400
that's insightful and thoughtful

29:39.400 --> 29:41.480
but like also helps me discover artists

29:41.480 --> 29:43.000
and albums that I've never heard of.

29:43.000 --> 29:45.240
Yeah, man, sounds like you need to listen to Heat Rocks.

29:45.240 --> 29:47.240
Every week, myself and I'm Morgan Rhodes

29:47.240 --> 29:49.320
and my co-host here, Oliver Wong,

29:49.320 --> 29:52.440
talk to influential guests about a canonical album

29:52.440 --> 29:54.520
that has changed their lives.

29:54.520 --> 29:56.840
Guests like Moby, Open Mike Eagle,

29:56.840 --> 29:59.320
talk about albums by Prince, Joni Mitchell,

29:59.320 --> 30:00.680
and so much more.

30:00.680 --> 30:02.680
Yo, what's that show called again?

30:02.680 --> 30:05.480
Heat Rocks, deep dives into hot records.

30:05.480 --> 30:07.480
Every Thursday on Maximum Fun.

30:09.320 --> 30:10.520
Y'all want a...

30:11.240 --> 30:14.040
Hold on, computer's being weirdly slow for a second.

30:14.600 --> 30:16.200
Okay, I think it's better now.

30:16.200 --> 30:18.200
Da, da, da, da, da, da.

30:18.200 --> 30:20.200
Da, da, da, da, da, da.

30:20.200 --> 30:22.200
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da.

30:22.200 --> 30:23.560
D, da, da, da, da, da.

30:23.560 --> 30:25.080
I wanna munch.

30:25.080 --> 30:27.080
Squad...

30:27.080 --> 30:28.440
Da, da, da, da, da, da.

30:28.440 --> 30:30.280
I wanna munch.

30:30.280 --> 30:31.480
Squad.

30:31.480 --> 30:32.920
Da, da, da, da, da.

30:32.920 --> 30:34.520
Bweh, bweh, bweh.

30:34.520 --> 30:36.280
There's hope for the Munch Squad still.

30:36.280 --> 30:38.600
I thought it was winding down

30:38.600 --> 30:40.520
but then I remembered that, you know,

30:40.520 --> 30:42.680
it's not just about current players

30:42.680 --> 30:44.280
in the fast-casual market.

30:44.280 --> 30:49.280
We've got new people lining up to join every single,

30:50.920 --> 30:52.000
well not day.

30:52.000 --> 30:52.840
That's ridiculous.

30:52.840 --> 30:54.440
That would be so shitty.

30:54.440 --> 30:55.280
Can you imagine?

30:55.280 --> 30:56.600
Here's a quick fact.

30:56.600 --> 31:00.800
A Carl Jr. slash Hardee's Western Bacon Cheeseburger

31:00.800 --> 31:04.680
is sold every 1.13 seconds.

31:04.680 --> 31:05.520
Oh wow.

31:05.520 --> 31:07.720
That's a Munch Squad quick fact for you.

31:07.720 --> 31:11.160
About once a second they sell one of these bad boys.

31:11.160 --> 31:12.760
They did some fries about it.

31:12.760 --> 31:13.960
You can Google it.

31:13.960 --> 31:15.040
This isn't about them.

31:15.040 --> 31:16.560
This is about Earl of Sandwich,

31:16.560 --> 31:20.440
a fast casual restaurant franchise.

31:20.440 --> 31:21.880
That was a wild way of saying that.

31:21.880 --> 31:23.560
I'll never be able to say that again.

31:23.560 --> 31:26.120
Franchise, co-founded by a...

31:28.000 --> 31:28.840
What?

31:28.840 --> 31:29.980
Co-founded by a direct descendant

31:29.980 --> 31:31.640
of the actual Earl of Sandwich.

31:31.640 --> 31:35.600
Oh man, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

31:35.600 --> 31:36.440
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

31:36.440 --> 31:38.320
It's in his blood.

31:38.320 --> 31:41.920
This restaurant, this new restaurant,

31:41.920 --> 31:45.560
is a part of the more than five acre Fast Eddie's campus

31:45.560 --> 31:49.940
on Eagle Road, which already includes a Chevron gas station,

31:49.940 --> 31:54.440
a convenience store, a car wash, and a lube shop.

31:54.440 --> 31:56.520
The entire complex is owned and operated

31:56.520 --> 31:59.560
by local entrepreneurs Steve and Tracy Eddie,

31:59.560 --> 32:01.040
who previously built and sold a chain

32:01.040 --> 32:03.320
of fuel and convenience stores in the Treasure Valley.

32:03.320 --> 32:05.160
This is in Idaho, by the way.

32:05.160 --> 32:06.640
If none of this is making sense to you,

32:06.640 --> 32:08.840
it's because it's like it's all in Idaho.

32:08.840 --> 32:09.760
Here's a quote.

32:09.760 --> 32:12.480
We wanted to find a restaurant concept unlike any other

32:12.480 --> 32:15.480
in the area, and Earl of Sandwich fit the bill.

32:15.480 --> 32:18.040
Earl of Sandwich appeals to the modern consumer.

32:18.040 --> 32:19.600
Those who believe that sandwiches

32:19.600 --> 32:21.480
are more than a convenience food,

32:21.480 --> 32:25.360
they should be carefully crafted and thoroughly enjoyed.

32:25.360 --> 32:27.640
Weird, says Steve. And what?

32:27.640 --> 32:29.240
Thoroughly enjoyed.

32:29.240 --> 32:34.240
We are thrilled to add Earl of Sandwich to our facility

32:35.240 --> 32:38.240
and are confident it will become the sandwich of choice

32:38.240 --> 32:40.280
for everyone in the community.

32:40.280 --> 32:44.680
Hey, so just so I can get this hunk of shit straight,

32:44.680 --> 32:47.440
they said that they said,

32:47.440 --> 32:51.760
they said they wanted to think of an idea

32:51.760 --> 32:54.000
that no one had ever done.

32:54.000 --> 32:56.200
And Michael, oh, we're revolutioning the idea

32:56.200 --> 32:57.680
of a quick service restaurant.

32:57.680 --> 33:00.600
So we went with sandwiches.

33:00.600 --> 33:03.840
Sandwiches made by a fucking king, Travis.

33:03.840 --> 33:07.400
Sandwiches made by literal, actual royalty.

33:07.400 --> 33:10.040
I've eaten at Lord Quiznos.

33:10.040 --> 33:11.520
This is one of the wildest paragraphs

33:11.520 --> 33:12.840
in the Much Quite history.

33:12.840 --> 33:15.520
The Earl of Sandwich concept revolves around the story

33:15.520 --> 33:19.280
of John Montague, the fourth Earl of Sandwich.

33:19.280 --> 33:21.480
He was a British nobleman, an avid gambler

33:21.480 --> 33:23.120
who, not wanting to leave the cart table to eat,

33:23.120 --> 33:25.320
asked for a serving of roast beef

33:25.320 --> 33:27.920
to be placed between two slices of bread

33:27.920 --> 33:29.600
so he could eat with his hands.

33:29.600 --> 33:31.960
Thus, the sandwich was born in 1762.

33:31.960 --> 33:36.960
Some 242 years later, Lord John Montague,

33:36.960 --> 33:41.200
the 11th Earl of Sandwich and direct descendant

33:41.200 --> 33:43.520
of the inventor of the sandwich,

33:43.520 --> 33:47.360
partnered with Robert Earl, not an Earl, but Robert Earl.

33:47.360 --> 33:52.160
Robert Earl of Earl of Sandwich.

33:52.160 --> 33:56.240
Earl, who is the founder and CEO of Planet Hollywood,

33:56.240 --> 34:00.120
to reclaim and reinvent the greatest of all quick food.

34:00.120 --> 34:03.200
So you think for like 242 years,

34:03.200 --> 34:05.760
everyone in this dude's fucking family is like,

34:05.760 --> 34:08.600
can we not talk about sandwiches?

34:08.600 --> 34:12.200
We did it one time, we made up a snack,

34:12.200 --> 34:14.200
and that's our whole fucking thing.

34:14.200 --> 34:17.000
And then this guy's like,

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
but this guy was like,

34:20.280 --> 34:23.440
maybe we're gonna go ahead and just capitalize on this

34:23.440 --> 34:28.000
because it seems to be the best thing that we got going.

34:28.000 --> 34:31.960
I think the play here, you open this one in Idaho,

34:31.960 --> 34:35.960
it's not very successful, but you have a claim

34:35.960 --> 34:40.960
to the yeasted throne in the sense that fucking,

34:41.080 --> 34:42.740
you invented the sandwich.

34:42.740 --> 34:45.720
So sorry, Subway, sorry, Quizno, sorry, Jimmy John.

34:45.720 --> 34:47.000
Your ass is mine now.

34:47.000 --> 34:51.400
There's no more sandwiches for you because I made them.

34:51.400 --> 34:53.360
Well, my great, great granddaddy made them.

34:53.360 --> 34:55.960
But still, that's copyright infringement, I think.

34:55.960 --> 34:57.240
Ooh.

34:57.240 --> 34:58.080
Right?

34:58.080 --> 35:00.640
Ooh, yeah, nobody else can make sandwiches.

35:00.640 --> 35:02.520
You can't call them this anymore.

35:02.520 --> 35:05.340
Bread boats, I don't know.

35:05.340 --> 35:07.040
They'd find some way, wouldn't they?

35:07.040 --> 35:09.600
Subway would be like, we're serving them

35:09.600 --> 35:12.120
in between two butt cheeks.

35:12.120 --> 35:14.180
Get on over to Subway now, baby.

35:15.080 --> 35:16.720
Do you think that when-

35:16.720 --> 35:18.080
Do you eat ass?

35:18.080 --> 35:19.520
It's a $5 ass.

35:19.520 --> 35:21.680
Come on, $5 foot ass, get in it.

35:22.600 --> 35:25.960
Do you think when John Montague showed up at this chain-

35:25.960 --> 35:27.160
Sorry, Lord John Montague?

35:27.160 --> 35:29.800
Lord John Montague, the 11th Earl of Sandwich,

35:29.800 --> 35:30.640
showed up at this chain.

35:30.640 --> 35:33.360
He was like, uh-huh, good, good.

35:33.360 --> 35:35.000
The Earl's Club, I love that.

35:35.000 --> 35:37.220
The original 1762 with roasted beef.

35:37.220 --> 35:38.640
They say roasted beef.

35:38.640 --> 35:40.120
Fuck off.

35:41.080 --> 35:42.840
French dip, very good.

35:42.840 --> 35:44.000
The holiday turkey.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.200
Does this one have cornbread stuffing on it?

35:46.200 --> 35:47.040
Excellent.

35:47.040 --> 35:48.000
A delicious sandwich.

35:48.000 --> 35:49.440
You've done my family pr-

35:50.680 --> 35:51.520
Wait.

35:52.480 --> 35:53.620
Wait a minute, is that?

35:55.160 --> 35:57.880
Is that a quinoa chicken salad?

35:57.880 --> 36:02.640
What, a salad with, what is this, quinoa?

36:02.640 --> 36:03.920
I think it's quinoa.

36:03.920 --> 36:05.680
It's a salad, just a regular,

36:05.680 --> 36:08.440
and he just starts flipping like bowls of salad

36:08.440 --> 36:09.400
out of the ground.

36:09.400 --> 36:11.080
Is this, what's this over here?

36:11.080 --> 36:13.840
Pepperoni pizza bread?

36:13.840 --> 36:16.160
Macaroni and cheese?

36:16.160 --> 36:18.280
No, get it all out.

36:18.280 --> 36:19.120
All of it.

36:19.120 --> 36:20.960
It is not, but it's two slices.

36:20.960 --> 36:24.080
I cannot eat it with my hands.

36:24.080 --> 36:26.760
Chips and potatoes.

36:26.760 --> 36:28.680
Get it out.

36:28.680 --> 36:30.840
Maybe perhaps the chipped potatoes

36:30.840 --> 36:33.760
will return two slices of bread.

36:33.760 --> 36:36.360
This potato salad claims to be salad,

36:36.360 --> 36:38.940
but it has no bearing.

36:38.940 --> 36:40.440
I'm just saying this all looks really good

36:40.440 --> 36:41.280
and I'm pretty hungry right now.

36:41.280 --> 36:43.000
I did kind of like that holiday turkey

36:43.000 --> 36:43.840
with the cornbread stuffing.

36:43.840 --> 36:45.380
Yeah, sounds promising.

36:45.380 --> 36:48.760
This all looks really good.

36:48.760 --> 36:50.000
How about a Yahoo?

36:50.000 --> 36:50.840
Yep.

36:50.840 --> 36:52.720
This one was sent in by, also by Graham Roebuck.

36:52.720 --> 36:53.560
Thank you, Graham.

36:53.560 --> 36:54.660
It's an anonymous Yahoo answers user.

36:54.660 --> 36:56.840
I'm going to call Beverly.

36:56.840 --> 37:01.280
Asks, how can I talk my dad into letting me have

37:01.280 --> 37:04.680
a 175 gallon aquarium?

37:06.540 --> 37:08.940
I don't know how big that is.

37:08.940 --> 37:10.360
I don't know how big that is.

37:10.360 --> 37:11.680
You know how when you're a kid,

37:11.680 --> 37:13.320
you had like a gallon of water

37:13.320 --> 37:16.320
and you like poured it into like a pool or a bathtub

37:16.320 --> 37:18.720
and it was fucking nothing?

37:18.720 --> 37:22.040
Like I don't know how big 175 gallons is.

37:22.040 --> 37:24.080
Can you guys, can we Google it?

37:24.080 --> 37:26.300
It feels like that's important.

37:26.300 --> 37:27.140
Because here's the thing.

37:27.140 --> 37:27.960
Oh, you don't want to do that.

37:27.960 --> 37:28.800
Okay.

37:28.800 --> 37:33.380
To Griffin's point, if I picture 175 gallon jugs of water,

37:33.380 --> 37:34.620
I would look at it and be like,

37:34.620 --> 37:37.200
wow, that's a lot of water, right?

37:37.200 --> 37:40.440
But I do have a strong suspicion

37:40.440 --> 37:42.560
that if you showed me one container

37:42.560 --> 37:44.440
that could contain 175 gallons,

37:44.440 --> 37:45.880
I'd be like, that's not nearly as big

37:45.880 --> 37:46.720
as I thought it would be.

37:46.720 --> 37:48.280
I'll tell you boys, I'll tell you.

37:48.280 --> 37:52.880
175 liquid gallons is 23.3941 cubic feet.

37:52.880 --> 37:55.480
Now, how fucking big is that?

37:55.480 --> 37:56.640
I don't know how big that is.

37:56.640 --> 37:57.480
I don't know how big that is.

37:57.480 --> 37:59.120
Okay, I just Googled it.

37:59.120 --> 38:02.680
It's 100%, 100% coffin-sized.

38:02.680 --> 38:05.800
Exactly on the nose, this is coffin-sized.

38:05.800 --> 38:06.640
Okay.

38:06.640 --> 38:07.520
And it even auto-filled.

38:07.520 --> 38:12.520
As I typed it up, I Googled, I typed 175 space G

38:12.560 --> 38:14.520
and it was like Alan fish tank.

38:15.880 --> 38:18.320
So this is a big, well, it depends.

38:18.320 --> 38:19.840
I've seen bigger fish tanks.

38:19.840 --> 38:21.160
At the aquarium, they have the one

38:21.160 --> 38:23.640
that's just like bigger than my freaking house, man.

38:23.640 --> 38:25.520
Not for home use, you haven't.

38:25.520 --> 38:27.000
You have not seen one for home use

38:27.000 --> 38:28.560
that's bigger than this bad boy.

38:28.560 --> 38:30.120
I guess it's a pretty big one.

38:31.200 --> 38:33.760
This feels like something that you would need to have

38:33.760 --> 38:36.720
at a restaurant so kids could look at it

38:36.720 --> 38:39.720
while you waited for your chair.

38:39.720 --> 38:43.360
Or alternatively, we're trying to convince the dad, right?

38:43.360 --> 38:44.720
We're trying to get daddy on board.

38:44.720 --> 38:46.600
To get daddy on board, you can say,

38:46.600 --> 38:47.720
yeah, it's a big fish tank,

38:47.720 --> 38:50.440
but we keep fresh seafood in there.

38:50.440 --> 38:53.880
And then you, every day, can be like, that one.

38:53.880 --> 38:55.240
Every day. That one.

38:55.240 --> 38:56.720
Every day. I'll eat this one.

38:56.720 --> 38:59.080
Also, think of how versatile it is.

38:59.080 --> 39:01.440
Yes, yes, you can put fish in it, of course.

39:01.440 --> 39:03.960
Yes, you could also perhaps put a reptile in there,

39:03.960 --> 39:05.440
maybe even an amphibian,

39:05.440 --> 39:08.640
but you could also store your clothes in it.

39:08.640 --> 39:10.680
You could keep all your loose change in it.

39:10.680 --> 39:13.240
You could just buy a whole bunch of boxes of cereal

39:13.240 --> 39:14.840
and dump it all in there with milk

39:14.840 --> 39:17.960
and have it be like a big cereal trough for a party.

39:17.960 --> 39:19.400
Oh, that's cool.

39:19.400 --> 39:22.160
You could fill it up with mustard and a single flag

39:22.160 --> 39:24.560
and let Double Dare kids rummage around in there.

39:24.560 --> 39:25.720
Yes, yeah.

39:25.720 --> 39:27.080
There's so many things.

39:27.080 --> 39:29.680
Like, think about, tell your dad this.

39:29.680 --> 39:32.440
Say, dad, think about all the stupid shit you've bought

39:32.440 --> 39:34.760
that only does one thing and it was really expensive.

39:34.760 --> 39:36.000
You dumb asshole.

39:36.000 --> 39:37.920
You dumb piece of shit.

39:37.920 --> 39:40.800
Like you're a pacemaker.

39:40.800 --> 39:41.880
Right.

39:41.880 --> 39:43.800
And what do you even do with it?

39:43.800 --> 39:44.640
You know?

39:44.640 --> 39:46.280
There's one thing. I can't even play with it.

39:46.280 --> 39:48.360
It doesn't even do Tamagotchis.

39:48.360 --> 39:51.600
But I could fill this fish tank with Tamagotchis, dad.

39:51.600 --> 39:54.080
Just try to stop me. Think about that, dad.

39:54.080 --> 39:56.360
I could sleep in this fish tank.

39:56.360 --> 39:58.160
I'm gonna sleep in my fish tank, dad.

39:58.160 --> 40:00.440
This is, you're not just buying me a fish tank.

40:00.440 --> 40:01.840
You're buying me a new bed.

40:02.720 --> 40:04.560
Come on, dad, grow up.

40:04.560 --> 40:06.560
Get a fish tank, finally.

40:06.560 --> 40:09.520
I think climbing inside the aquarium

40:09.520 --> 40:12.720
and refusing to come out is one way to make your dad buy it.

40:12.720 --> 40:16.360
That's a good way to make your dad buy anything.

40:16.360 --> 40:18.000
You go in the aquarium store,

40:18.000 --> 40:19.360
and you're like, I want this one.

40:19.360 --> 40:22.680
And he says, that is 175 too many gallons.

40:22.680 --> 40:24.480
And then you say, oh, okay.

40:24.480 --> 40:25.480
And you climb inside.

40:25.480 --> 40:27.560
And then you say, checkmate.

40:27.560 --> 40:29.720
Because he's gotta buy it.

40:29.720 --> 40:30.560
You're in it.

40:30.560 --> 40:31.400
No, he's gotta buy it.

40:31.400 --> 40:32.520
His son's in it.

40:32.520 --> 40:33.680
He can't just leave you there.

40:33.680 --> 40:35.560
That's against the rules.

40:35.560 --> 40:36.600
Now it is important.

40:36.600 --> 40:38.040
You can never get out of it.

40:38.040 --> 40:40.360
Cause when you do, he'll immediately return it.

40:40.360 --> 40:41.200
No, he won't.

40:41.200 --> 40:42.920
It's 175 fucking gallon fish tank.

40:42.920 --> 40:45.600
Like he's gonna wanna get that outside of his house again.

40:45.600 --> 40:46.760
It's gonna be tough enough to do it

40:46.760 --> 40:49.800
with a big boy inside of it.

40:49.800 --> 40:52.160
Okay, well then let's say you can't get out of it

40:52.160 --> 40:53.880
until he's gotten it home.

40:53.880 --> 40:54.960
Yeah.

40:54.960 --> 40:57.080
Can you find a mattress that would fit it?

40:57.080 --> 40:57.920
Probably.

40:57.920 --> 41:01.460
Cause then it would be like kind of a fun bed,

41:01.460 --> 41:03.080
novelty bed.

41:03.080 --> 41:04.400
And you could just at night,

41:04.400 --> 41:06.700
at every night you take the water out.

41:07.800 --> 41:08.800
That's a bad idea.

41:08.800 --> 41:09.640
No, no, no, keep going.

41:09.640 --> 41:11.800
Now that I'm running through all the p's and q's.

41:11.800 --> 41:13.880
No, you just dump all the water out,

41:13.880 --> 41:15.640
put the fish in a jug.

41:15.640 --> 41:17.420
You put your mattress in there.

41:17.420 --> 41:18.960
You sleep in there.

41:18.960 --> 41:20.260
That's space saving.

41:20.260 --> 41:21.660
It's a value.

41:21.660 --> 41:23.480
It's not a good idea.

41:23.480 --> 41:26.520
You could get this and say,

41:26.520 --> 41:28.860
daddy, let's just put one little fish in it.

41:29.720 --> 41:32.800
And think of what a great treat that will be for him.

41:33.760 --> 41:35.120
Daddy, I wanna get this big one

41:35.120 --> 41:36.760
so we can put one fish inside

41:36.760 --> 41:38.920
and that fish is gonna be so lucky.

41:38.920 --> 41:41.880
And then we owe it to the earth to do that for,

41:41.880 --> 41:43.840
it's all, you can't save the world by yourself,

41:43.840 --> 41:46.120
but you can make the, you know, a good situation

41:46.120 --> 41:47.580
for just one fish.

41:48.440 --> 41:49.280
That's pretty good.

41:49.280 --> 41:50.280
I like that.

41:50.280 --> 41:53.040
Alternatively, you could open up a fish fighting ring

41:53.040 --> 41:54.380
in your house and say, daddy,

41:54.380 --> 41:57.080
we'll get 10% of the pot every time, so.

41:57.080 --> 41:57.920
Okay.

41:57.920 --> 41:59.120
Now you think about it.

41:59.120 --> 42:00.720
Your dad says he wants to,

42:00.720 --> 42:02.760
he won't get you a 175 gallon tank.

42:02.760 --> 42:04.880
Okay, dad, you win this one.

42:04.880 --> 42:06.360
Will you get me a 10 gallon tank?

42:06.360 --> 42:07.280
Oh, yeah, of course.

42:07.280 --> 42:08.760
It's no problem.

42:08.760 --> 42:10.760
And then a few weeks later,

42:10.760 --> 42:11.880
just say like, hey, dad,

42:11.880 --> 42:14.940
I need a 10 gallon fish tank.

42:14.940 --> 42:17.400
That's still really, you said it was fine, right?

42:17.400 --> 42:18.240
That's fine?

42:18.240 --> 42:19.720
And your dad's like, yeah, it's fine, go ahead.

42:19.720 --> 42:23.000
Repeat 17 and a half times.

42:23.000 --> 42:24.980
Then all of a sudden you've got 10,

42:25.920 --> 42:30.680
no, wait, you've got 17 and a half 10 gallon fish tanks

42:30.680 --> 42:32.640
and your dad feels like an asshole

42:32.640 --> 42:35.420
because he's paying for all these like pumps

42:35.420 --> 42:37.440
and decorations and things.

42:37.440 --> 42:39.180
He could save a lot of dough

42:39.180 --> 42:41.040
just doing it the right way the first time.

42:41.040 --> 42:43.520
If you do the job the right way the first time.

42:43.520 --> 42:45.480
And he's had to take you to the hospital a few times

42:45.480 --> 42:46.760
because of how you've tried to smash

42:46.760 --> 42:50.280
all these fish tanks together to make one big fish tank.

42:50.280 --> 42:52.120
And there's been cuts.

42:52.120 --> 42:53.480
Your dad feels like the jerk.

42:53.480 --> 42:56.060
Who's someone your dad respects

42:56.060 --> 42:58.840
absolutely, entirely, completely?

42:58.840 --> 42:59.680
Mr. Bean.

42:59.680 --> 43:00.520
Mr. Bean.

43:00.520 --> 43:01.340
You say-

43:01.340 --> 43:02.520
Oh, wait, were you talking about my dad?

43:02.520 --> 43:03.360
Yeah, okay.

43:03.360 --> 43:04.180
This guy's dad.

43:04.180 --> 43:05.020
My dad.

43:05.020 --> 43:06.200
If your dad is our dad,

43:06.200 --> 43:09.920
then you go to the aquarium store with your dad

43:09.920 --> 43:13.320
and you just kind of almost say like offhandedly,

43:13.320 --> 43:17.160
like, oh yeah, I heard Mr. Bean talking about

43:17.160 --> 43:18.600
on entertainment tonight

43:18.600 --> 43:20.280
that if you're going to get a fish tank,

43:20.280 --> 43:21.800
the only fish tank you want to get

43:21.800 --> 43:23.480
is a 175 gallon fish tank.

43:23.480 --> 43:25.800
Yeah, my dad, yeah, you know, dad,

43:25.800 --> 43:28.440
I heard this is the kind of tank that Travis Tritt owns.

43:28.440 --> 43:29.480
There you go.

43:29.480 --> 43:30.320
There it is.

43:30.320 --> 43:31.800
Travis Tritt owns this exact model.

43:31.800 --> 43:32.880
Fuck it, all right, fuck it, man.

43:32.880 --> 43:36.200
Get Travis Tritt to just like walk by you, behind you.

43:36.200 --> 43:38.640
Look at, that's a badass fish tank, man.

43:38.640 --> 43:39.480
That's a great tank right there.

43:39.480 --> 43:40.320
Yeah, that's a good tank.

43:40.320 --> 43:41.440
That's the kind of tank I got.

43:41.440 --> 43:43.040
That's a good tank for a great price.

43:43.040 --> 43:44.160
And I want to thank you again

43:44.160 --> 43:46.760
for shopping Travis Tritt's Aquariums and more.

43:47.640 --> 43:49.040
Yo, come on back anytime.

43:49.040 --> 43:49.880
You're welcome.

43:49.880 --> 43:51.400
And nobody's going to give you a better deal than Travis.

43:51.400 --> 43:52.240
That's what's on the side.

43:52.240 --> 43:54.480
Hey, thanks for shopping at Tritt and quit it.

43:54.480 --> 43:55.600
He's done.

43:55.600 --> 43:57.960
Grab yourself a fish tank and then get on out.

43:57.960 --> 43:58.920
I've Tritt tanks.

43:58.920 --> 44:01.600
I'd fill that shit up with mustard, I would.

44:01.600 --> 44:02.440
I often do.

44:02.440 --> 44:04.420
And let some kids double down around in there.

44:04.420 --> 44:05.260
Double dare did him.

44:05.260 --> 44:06.520
It's always a great day to be alive here

44:06.520 --> 44:09.000
at Travis Tritt's Aquariums and stuff.

44:09.000 --> 44:11.040
Okay, anyways, please move on.

44:11.040 --> 44:13.040
Travis Tritt's Fish and Shits.

44:13.040 --> 44:18.040
Hey folks, this is Travis Tritt for Travis Tritt's

44:21.540 --> 44:22.380
Fish and Shits.

44:22.380 --> 44:24.880
I just want to remind you that we are working every day

44:24.880 --> 44:26.960
to obtain the license that we need to sell fish

44:26.960 --> 44:29.040
directly to you, the consumer.

44:29.040 --> 44:30.720
We're just weeks to months away.

44:30.720 --> 44:33.640
Our lawyers assure us from getting those special permits

44:33.640 --> 44:35.940
that will allow us to sell the finest quality fish

44:35.940 --> 44:37.320
at the finest quality prices.

44:37.320 --> 44:39.880
And please, please do not confuse this location

44:39.880 --> 44:42.020
with Travis Tritt's Fish and Chips.

44:42.020 --> 44:44.320
That is across town.

44:44.320 --> 44:48.020
Both are mine and both were poorly planned.

44:48.020 --> 44:48.860
Thank you.

44:48.860 --> 44:49.680
Now weirdly-

44:49.680 --> 44:51.840
I work at one during the morning and one during the night

44:51.840 --> 44:54.040
and I won't answer any more questions about that.

44:54.040 --> 44:54.880
Thank you.

44:56.240 --> 44:58.480
That's getting personal, folks.

44:58.480 --> 45:01.400
And yes, I still find time to make music.

45:01.400 --> 45:03.680
Don't be an asshole about it.

45:03.680 --> 45:05.300
And I balance work and family.

45:05.300 --> 45:07.580
Okay, can we please move on?

45:07.580 --> 45:11.820
Ask me about my love of fish, both retail and dining.

45:11.820 --> 45:13.360
Everyone wants to know about the fish.

45:13.360 --> 45:15.720
Nobody asked me about the and shits.

45:18.320 --> 45:19.140
That's fine.

45:19.140 --> 45:21.000
I got CD players in here too, but that's fine.

45:21.000 --> 45:23.760
I guess you just want to talk about this.

45:23.760 --> 45:26.040
Got back some Gatorade brand gum.

45:26.040 --> 45:28.640
It's been inspired for five years.

45:28.640 --> 45:29.480
Nobody asked me about it.

45:29.480 --> 45:33.000
Yeah, let's talk about these fucking stupid fish, I guess.

45:33.000 --> 45:35.440
Tim Conway passed.

45:35.440 --> 45:37.520
I would love to talk about this complete set

45:37.520 --> 45:39.520
of Dorphe and Jeff's tapes that I got,

45:39.520 --> 45:40.360
but I can't sell them.

45:40.360 --> 45:41.200
I guess I can't.

45:41.200 --> 45:42.120
I guess I can't.

45:42.120 --> 45:43.560
Everybody wants to talk about the fish

45:43.560 --> 45:44.960
that I can't legally sell.

45:44.960 --> 45:46.980
God's wettest and worst animal.

45:48.360 --> 45:49.200
God, I hate fish.

45:50.700 --> 45:52.200
What have I done?

45:52.200 --> 45:53.040
What have I done?

45:53.040 --> 45:55.560
I should have thought this through.

45:55.560 --> 45:57.480
How about one last question?

45:57.480 --> 46:00.220
Recently, a friend and I popped into a liquor store

46:00.220 --> 46:03.400
on our way to do some thrift shopping.

46:03.400 --> 46:07.800
Once inside, we noticed that they had a wine tasting label,

46:07.800 --> 46:10.680
sorry, table, and we decided to spend a few extra minutes

46:10.680 --> 46:12.640
tasting some vine.

46:12.640 --> 46:15.160
That's when we noticed the number seven on the table

46:15.160 --> 46:17.520
and looked around to see at least six other

46:17.520 --> 46:20.600
wine tasting tables scattered around the store.

46:20.600 --> 46:24.800
Y'all, each table had six wines available to sample

46:24.800 --> 46:26.960
and everything else is free.

46:26.960 --> 46:30.080
My question is, what is the appropriate etiquette here?

46:30.080 --> 46:33.640
What, are we supposed to drink 42 wine samples?

46:33.640 --> 46:35.600
Or is there a more strategic and classy way

46:35.600 --> 46:37.080
to handle this offering?

46:37.080 --> 46:40.240
That's for more loads of options.

46:40.240 --> 46:42.280
What would you do, Griffin?

46:42.280 --> 46:43.720
What I would do?

46:43.720 --> 46:45.360
Yeah.

46:45.360 --> 46:49.680
I would go around, I would smell all 42 of these little cups

46:49.680 --> 46:51.920
and I mean, huff them deep.

46:51.920 --> 46:55.360
And on the 42nd one, I accidentally snort some up my nose

46:55.360 --> 46:57.200
and I would start coughing and have to leave

46:57.200 --> 46:58.980
because I got embarrassed.

46:58.980 --> 47:00.160
Okay, that's what Griffin would do.

47:00.160 --> 47:01.480
Justin, what would you do?

47:01.480 --> 47:03.720
Let me say, let me say, that's not what I wanna do.

47:03.720 --> 47:05.020
That's just what would happen.

47:05.020 --> 47:06.360
That's just what happened.

47:07.320 --> 47:11.480
If I went, I would want to drink all of them

47:11.480 --> 47:13.820
because they were there, but then I would assume

47:13.820 --> 47:15.720
that I'd pick the first one up and another,

47:15.720 --> 47:17.800
like maybe a human being who worked there

47:17.800 --> 47:20.560
or a human being who knew the process better than me

47:20.560 --> 47:24.040
would say out loud, that's not what you're supposed to do

47:24.040 --> 47:26.000
and I would melt into the floor.

47:26.000 --> 47:28.160
Yeah, like Alex Mack, sure.

47:28.160 --> 47:30.760
Right, right.

47:30.760 --> 47:32.040
You know, I love one.

47:33.220 --> 47:37.000
I think maybe just pick one of the different varietals

47:37.000 --> 47:40.320
that you wanna try, like just the cabs

47:40.320 --> 47:41.840
and then just sample the cabs

47:41.840 --> 47:43.680
and then everyone will understand that,

47:43.680 --> 47:46.320
say I'm just looking for high test cabs.

47:46.320 --> 47:47.160
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

47:47.160 --> 47:50.020
Just your best cabs and then once you've tried them all,

47:50.020 --> 47:51.960
maybe you're kinda like, hey, listen,

47:51.960 --> 47:53.280
I've been thinking a lot about it

47:53.280 --> 47:56.840
and I think I'm more of a short name man now.

47:56.840 --> 48:00.200
So I would like to try your shards, see how they're doing.

48:00.200 --> 48:03.540
And then you can just go brand by brand, varietal by varietal.

48:03.540 --> 48:04.720
That's cool, yeah.

48:04.720 --> 48:07.680
And then you can step outside and shit your pants

48:07.680 --> 48:11.540
and I don't know that we should necessarily endorse

48:11.540 --> 48:13.040
that course of action.

48:13.040 --> 48:15.880
No, I don't think binge drinking is a good,

48:15.880 --> 48:19.760
do you see anything that's vaguely bucket shaped?

48:19.760 --> 48:21.320
Is there anything that looks like a bucket?

48:21.320 --> 48:24.400
Because that's supposed to be spit in that.

48:24.400 --> 48:25.240
Yeah.

48:25.240 --> 48:26.080
It's supposed to be spit in that.

48:26.080 --> 48:28.000
You're not supposed to be getting a day drunk

48:28.000 --> 48:30.200
going to the liquor store, I'm pretty sure.

48:30.200 --> 48:31.400
I think you're supposed to,

48:31.400 --> 48:33.020
if you don't drink the right one,

48:33.020 --> 48:35.760
you turn old and turn into ash and bones and stuff.

48:35.760 --> 48:37.400
Yes, that's probably true.

48:37.400 --> 48:39.220
So that's important.

48:39.220 --> 48:42.800
You're gonna have to mix four of them to solve a riddle.

48:42.800 --> 48:43.640
Like feel like-

48:43.640 --> 48:44.460
Yeah, you're trying to,

48:44.460 --> 48:45.560
you got a five gallon jug and a three gallon jug.

48:45.560 --> 48:47.680
Right, yes, yes, yes, yes.

48:47.680 --> 48:49.860
And a 175 gallon fish tank.

48:51.560 --> 48:53.060
I mean, I would just go to the back of the store,

48:53.060 --> 48:55.360
grab a sixer or a bud and say like,

48:55.360 --> 48:57.400
this is my wine.

48:57.400 --> 49:00.840
And then I'd walk out of the store without paying.

49:00.840 --> 49:03.960
I think maybe if I owned this liquor store,

49:03.960 --> 49:07.040
I would set this up with like 42 free samples of wine.

49:07.040 --> 49:08.980
And when someone walked through, I'd be like,

49:08.980 --> 49:10.800
yes, it's all free.

49:10.800 --> 49:12.560
And it's 42 samples of wine.

49:12.560 --> 49:15.120
One of the 42 is poisoned.

49:15.120 --> 49:16.960
Oh, that's a bad idea.

49:16.960 --> 49:19.520
Okay, but then statistically, if you want-

49:19.520 --> 49:20.680
Less than nothing, that one.

49:20.680 --> 49:22.560
If you want a bunch of free wine,

49:23.480 --> 49:25.280
cool, listen, that's fine.

49:25.280 --> 49:27.600
But you have to ask me about each one

49:27.600 --> 49:29.080
before you drink it.

49:29.080 --> 49:31.700
Oh, oh, okay.

49:31.700 --> 49:34.840
So if you don't ask about the one that's poison,

49:34.840 --> 49:35.840
then you're the asshole.

49:35.840 --> 49:37.380
They'll tell you, right.

49:37.380 --> 49:39.260
You could test all of them and be like,

49:39.260 --> 49:41.960
okay, I've found my favorite one.

49:41.960 --> 49:44.120
And then fucking like Ellen comes out

49:44.120 --> 49:46.840
and she's like, this is a big social prank.

49:46.840 --> 49:48.300
They're all the same wine.

49:48.300 --> 49:52.760
And this is proof about how fucking fake America is.

49:52.760 --> 49:55.840
And then you're like, Ellen, your brand has changed

49:55.840 --> 49:56.880
a little bit.

49:56.880 --> 49:58.760
Maybe Griffin should have thought of somebody else to,

49:58.760 --> 50:01.840
and she's like, I know it's strange for me to put America

50:01.840 --> 50:04.400
and sort of their habits and beliefs on blast,

50:04.400 --> 50:07.560
but everybody's got their noses in their phones all the time

50:07.560 --> 50:10.040
and everybody's taking pictures of their food on Instagram

50:10.040 --> 50:11.400
and all this wine is the same.

50:11.400 --> 50:14.040
So now you're a dumb idiot and-

50:14.040 --> 50:15.620
And I'm gonna dance.

50:15.620 --> 50:17.240
I'm going to dance on out of the store

50:17.240 --> 50:18.120
and you have to watch me.

50:18.120 --> 50:21.520
I'm gonna dance and pray for the destruction of America,

50:21.520 --> 50:24.040
which is a garbage country that I hate now.

50:24.040 --> 50:25.360
Thank you for me, Ellen.

50:27.080 --> 50:28.720
I'm gonna pray for your downfall.

50:30.560 --> 50:33.040
Your gods have become dust under me, Ellen.

50:33.040 --> 50:35.120
Also, Jennifer Lawrence is in this box.

50:35.120 --> 50:38.280
She's gonna jump out and scare you, but why even bother?

50:38.280 --> 50:39.800
Why even fucking bother?

50:39.800 --> 50:40.800
Stay in there, Jennifer.

50:40.800 --> 50:42.160
America was a mistake.

50:42.160 --> 50:43.200
I'm Ellen DeGeneres.

50:43.200 --> 50:44.200
It's time to dance.

50:46.200 --> 50:47.840
Happy Independence Day, everybody.

50:47.840 --> 50:48.680
This is-

50:48.680 --> 50:51.960
The worm-filled carcass of liberty

50:53.760 --> 50:56.360
is my next guest and your guest

50:56.360 --> 50:58.320

50:58.320 --> 51:00.920
Anyways, here's a kid who can yodel or whatever the fuck.

51:00.920 --> 51:02.480
Here's a kid who can yodel

51:02.480 --> 51:04.840
about the downfall of imperialism.

51:06.400 --> 51:09.400
And our musical guest is, once again,
