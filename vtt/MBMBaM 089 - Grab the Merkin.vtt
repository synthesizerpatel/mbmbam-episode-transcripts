00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:47.760
Welcome to My Brother and My Brother and Me, an advice show for the modern era.

00:47.760 --> 00:51.680
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy, and I was just talking with my middle brother,

00:51.680 --> 00:55.280
Travis McElroy. You just went to Zen church, Travis, correct?

00:55.280 --> 00:55.840
That is correct.

00:55.840 --> 01:01.680
And you and I have been told by you that your chakras are really right.

01:01.680 --> 01:03.600
They are gaping open.

01:03.600 --> 01:04.480
Oh, God.

01:04.480 --> 01:08.800
Your chakras are so sharp that Xena could throw them.

01:08.800 --> 01:11.520
That's right. That is correct.

01:11.520 --> 01:17.760
Now, I did have a question about Zen church, and I think you're probably better equipped

01:17.760 --> 01:20.160
to answer it than my youngest brother, Griffin McElroy, who's also with us.

01:20.160 --> 01:26.400
When you go, do you have to renounce Jesus and his teachings, or how does that work?

01:26.400 --> 01:30.960
Well, I wouldn't say renounce, but he is not allowed to come in with me.

01:31.920 --> 01:38.160
He has to sit on the stairs outside and wait for me, like that scene in Peanuts when Snoopy

01:38.160 --> 01:41.920
has to wait outside the library for Charlie Brown, and the music plays, and it plays,

01:41.920 --> 01:44.320
no Jesus allowed.

01:44.320 --> 01:44.820
Yeah.

01:45.680 --> 01:46.180
Wow.

01:46.180 --> 01:48.480
Now, does he mind that? Is that hard on him?

01:48.480 --> 01:53.920
No, I give him some money to grab an ice cream bar from the ice cream man when he passes,

01:53.920 --> 01:55.440
so he has a pretty good time.

01:56.000 --> 01:56.500
Okay, good.

01:56.500 --> 02:00.400
This podcast took a pretty sharp anti-Jesus turn pretty quickly.

02:00.400 --> 02:02.160
Why? I'm giving him ice cream.

02:02.160 --> 02:04.080
How is that anti-Jesus?

02:04.080 --> 02:07.280
You know, I went to see my voodoo practitioner today, and you guys didn't see me.

02:07.280 --> 02:08.560
You're going to talk to me about that.

02:09.920 --> 02:14.720
You've been hugely, hugely different personality-wise since you started.

02:14.720 --> 02:19.200
Every time I try to eat a frog, you're like, hey, what are you doing with this gizzard?

02:19.200 --> 02:19.700
That's racist.

02:19.700 --> 02:21.200
Can I have his gizzard?

02:21.200 --> 02:24.000
That thing you just said is racist.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.480
Voodoo practitioners love gizzards, frog gizzards.

02:26.480 --> 02:27.760
They use them in everything.

02:27.760 --> 02:29.440
It's racist to Voodoos?

02:29.440 --> 02:29.940
Is that-

02:29.940 --> 02:32.880
To the Voodoo people, like me.

02:32.880 --> 02:33.380
To the Voodoo-

02:33.380 --> 02:34.880
The Voodees.

02:34.880 --> 02:38.320
The Creole, ah, fuck it.

02:38.320 --> 02:41.840
Jesus lives in my heart, and I never let him out.

02:41.840 --> 02:42.400
He's like a prisoner.

02:42.400 --> 02:43.600
You don't let him get ice cream?

02:44.160 --> 02:46.080
I don't let him get out for anything.

02:46.080 --> 02:47.760
Only the ice cream that Justin eats.

02:47.760 --> 02:49.920
I'm afraid he'll leave.

02:49.920 --> 02:53.120
He says he needs to get out to stretch his legs.

02:53.120 --> 02:55.520
I say, no, you stay in there.

02:55.520 --> 02:56.480
He's a POW.

03:00.080 --> 03:01.040
Prisoner of worship.

03:01.040 --> 03:02.000
Prisoner of worship.

03:03.360 --> 03:05.200
So let's get to the end of this podcast.

03:05.200 --> 03:14.320
I'm 22 years old, and I've never been involved in any kind of sports due to the fact that I

03:14.320 --> 03:17.280
used to be rather overweight and hated any physical activity.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.800
That never stopped Goldberg the goalie, but we'll move on.

03:21.360 --> 03:25.760
After deciding to lose some weight, I've dropped over 80 pounds and have found myself

03:25.760 --> 03:27.600
in an awkward situation.

03:27.600 --> 03:31.040
I want to get involved in team sports, but due to my lack of effort growing up,

03:31.040 --> 03:34.000
I feel inept in any physical activities I was running on my own.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.120
Not really a team sport.

03:35.680 --> 03:40.080
Do you have any suggestions on sports I could easily pick up or ways to join a sports team

03:40.080 --> 03:41.600
and pretend that I'm good?

03:41.600 --> 03:43.760
That's from Inept in England.

03:43.760 --> 03:45.360
And boy, have you come to the right place.

03:45.360 --> 03:48.000
Well, first, congrats on dropping 80 pounds.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.520
Jesus Christ, dude.

03:49.520 --> 03:50.560
Is it that easy?

03:50.560 --> 03:51.200
Can I do that?

03:51.200 --> 03:54.160
Can I just be like, I decided to weigh 80 less pounds.

03:54.160 --> 03:57.520
Yeah, I was going to say, I feel like there's a couple steps in the middle there.

03:57.520 --> 03:59.840
I decided to lose some weight, so I dropped 80 pounds.

03:59.840 --> 04:00.880
Welded off.

04:00.880 --> 04:01.360
Yeah, right.

04:01.360 --> 04:04.080
All right, I don't know.

04:04.080 --> 04:08.000
First off, sports in England, I don't know what you guys are doing over there.

04:08.000 --> 04:11.440
So you're going to have to take our American advice.

04:11.440 --> 04:15.440
And maybe there's probably a parallel sport for every sport that we recommend.

04:15.440 --> 04:18.240
Run it through Google Translator or something.

04:18.240 --> 04:23.920
You got cricket, you got crocket, you got darts, you got lawn darts.

04:23.920 --> 04:24.480
Rugby?

04:24.480 --> 04:25.520
That's huge over there.

04:25.520 --> 04:26.000
Rugby.

04:26.560 --> 04:27.200
Darts.

04:27.200 --> 04:28.800
Extreme rugby.

04:28.800 --> 04:30.400
Double extreme rugby.

04:30.400 --> 04:31.520
And boring rugby.

04:31.520 --> 04:32.400
Boring rugby.

04:33.600 --> 04:34.640
No hands, anybody.

04:35.920 --> 04:37.120
This is no hands rugby.

04:37.920 --> 04:39.360
No hands, no feet rugby.

04:41.920 --> 04:48.080
The thing is, there are sports you could play if you're just a big fat guy without athletic talent.

04:49.760 --> 04:55.120
I know when I was playing midget league football, I was the center, which meant that I stood there.

04:55.120 --> 04:58.640
I was not aware of the rules of football.

04:58.640 --> 05:00.320
And people just kept running into you.

05:00.320 --> 05:02.080
They kept running into me and it would hurt.

05:03.040 --> 05:04.000
Hey, excuse me, bro.

05:04.000 --> 05:04.800
I was standing there.

05:04.800 --> 05:06.000
You got me again.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.320
You could be, yeah, that's a great, center's a great position.

05:08.320 --> 05:11.840
I believe that was the position filled by Fridge the Refrigerator Perry.

05:12.640 --> 05:14.480
Yeah, but he's not big anymore.

05:14.480 --> 05:17.520
You know, Griffin, I'm almost certain his first name is not Fridge.

05:18.960 --> 05:21.760
He's Fridge, nicknamed the Refrigerator.

05:21.760 --> 05:24.640
Hey, I got a great nickname for you, Fridge.

05:24.640 --> 05:25.440
Let me guess.

05:25.440 --> 05:26.320
I thought that-

05:26.320 --> 05:27.440
It's Whirlpool.

05:27.440 --> 05:30.080
It was because he was shaped like a refrigerator.

05:30.960 --> 05:32.720
And also his first name was Fridge.

05:32.720 --> 05:34.240
And so it was really logical.

05:34.880 --> 05:36.320
They put two and two together.

05:37.120 --> 05:40.160
What about Warren, Warren the Refrigerator Sap?

05:41.200 --> 05:42.480
Former Buccaneer Slime Man.

05:43.920 --> 05:45.600
John the Refrigerator Elway.

05:45.600 --> 05:48.400
It's just a, it's a, it's a name that gets passed down.

05:48.400 --> 05:51.440
Chris, Chris the Refrigerator Sabo, he needs a letter.

05:53.520 --> 05:54.240
Sports.

05:54.240 --> 05:58.560
Maria the Refrigerator Sharapova.

05:58.560 --> 06:02.640
You know, as far as team sports, I know what you're saying,

06:02.640 --> 06:06.480
because it's like a lot of people depend on you catching the baseball

06:06.480 --> 06:08.160
and knowing where to throw the baseball.

06:08.720 --> 06:10.800
That's why I didn't do very well.

06:11.440 --> 06:14.480
I tried to join a softball team and I would, I would catch it.

06:14.480 --> 06:17.200
I got good hand-eye coordination from the vidya games,

06:17.200 --> 06:19.760
but then I would catch it, just sort of look panicked.

06:19.760 --> 06:23.440
Yeah, and just drop it on the ground and go, I don't want it.

06:23.440 --> 06:24.320
I don't want it.

06:24.320 --> 06:25.040
It's too much.

06:25.040 --> 06:25.680
Not mine.

06:25.680 --> 06:30.000
I always, my legs lock up like one of those fucking fainting goats.

06:30.000 --> 06:33.360
Whenever anyone pays any amount of attention to me,

06:33.360 --> 06:37.680
which made, which made playing the infield and baseball really, really terrifying.

06:37.680 --> 06:38.880
Cause like it's a shortstop.

06:38.880 --> 06:41.360
If you catch that ball and try to run it to third,

06:41.360 --> 06:45.120
but then your legs lock up and you fall over and you poop your pants a little bit,

06:45.920 --> 06:47.600
they won't let you play sports anymore.

06:48.240 --> 06:49.600
The Griffin McElroy story.

06:49.600 --> 06:54.480
The story of Chris O'Donnell coming to a theater near you.

06:54.480 --> 06:57.440
Do you guys have over in England, do you guys have kickball?

06:57.440 --> 06:58.480
Do you guys do kickball?

06:59.280 --> 07:01.040
Cause I find that that's really easy to like,

07:01.040 --> 07:03.040
just step into a game and like call your friends.

07:03.040 --> 07:05.680
Like, Hey, you guys want to get together a kickball game?

07:06.800 --> 07:07.840
Like kickball is pretty good.

07:07.840 --> 07:10.320
It's not really, I don't think it qualifies as a sport.

07:10.320 --> 07:13.200
It's more of a game, but I think it'd be a good place to start.

07:13.200 --> 07:16.800
But it's a good place to like start learning the basics of like team sports

07:16.800 --> 07:19.520
and everything and kind of get out there and get active.

07:19.520 --> 07:24.720
Here in the Americas, we have social clubs in some cities where you can come and play.

07:24.720 --> 07:26.400
There's actually two here in Austin.

07:26.400 --> 07:29.360
And one is for people who are actually good at sports.

07:29.360 --> 07:30.640
And I think they have like a softball league.

07:30.640 --> 07:33.280
And the other one is for people who just want to like drink and hang out outside

07:34.080 --> 07:36.160
and play like kickball and the like.

07:36.160 --> 07:40.000
And the best is when the two of them compete for the citywide trophy.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.440
It just gets rambunctious.

07:41.440 --> 07:44.400
You basically get a heavy dual scenario going on.

07:44.400 --> 07:47.600
They have a name for people who just want to drink and play outside.

07:47.600 --> 07:49.440
It's called all of sports ever.

07:52.000 --> 07:56.800
The good news is I found, because I, you know, I too am not the biggest sports nut,

07:56.800 --> 08:01.360
but I find that you've probably got a friend that if you said to him,

08:01.360 --> 08:03.760
you know, I'm kind of interested in sports,

08:03.760 --> 08:08.160
he is just going to inundate you with help and facts and be like,

08:08.160 --> 08:09.200
well, come on with me.

08:09.200 --> 08:12.720
Let's go down and watch a cricket bout.

08:12.720 --> 08:16.640
You know, what's funny by definition, if you about the phrase,

08:16.640 --> 08:20.880
I'm not a sports nut, is that if you actually use the phrase sports nut,

08:20.880 --> 08:24.320
it automatically disqualifies you from the distinction.

08:24.320 --> 08:26.080
Unless you're Bob Uecker.

08:26.080 --> 08:28.880
If you're Bob Uecker, he can say he's a sports nut.

08:28.880 --> 08:29.200
Yeah.

08:29.200 --> 08:31.360
Other than that, like you don't like sports.

08:33.200 --> 08:35.760
You're saying something you think someone like sports says.

08:36.400 --> 08:38.960
I'm a bit of a sports nut.

08:38.960 --> 08:41.920
I think you could call me a sports nut.

08:41.920 --> 08:44.400
I spend time at the BW3s.

08:44.400 --> 08:47.440
One could accurately classify me as a basketball man.

08:50.560 --> 08:51.520
A soccerista.

08:52.320 --> 08:54.400
A soccerista in your country.

08:56.880 --> 08:57.840
Well, I don't know what they call it.

08:57.840 --> 08:58.560
Footballerino.

08:59.200 --> 09:01.440
Football, footballist, I guess.

09:04.240 --> 09:05.040
You know what's great?

09:05.680 --> 09:06.480
Lawn games.

09:07.200 --> 09:09.280
I don't know if you can solve your problem with lawn games,

09:09.280 --> 09:12.400
but lawn games are like sports only.

09:12.400 --> 09:15.440
They don't require any movement whatsoever.

09:15.440 --> 09:17.440
And you can drink outside while you play them.

09:17.440 --> 09:19.920
And like the more you drink, the better you get at them.

09:19.920 --> 09:20.240
Yeah.

09:20.240 --> 09:21.360
Can you like frisbee?

09:21.360 --> 09:22.080
No, I mean like-

09:22.720 --> 09:23.440
Ladder ball.

09:23.440 --> 09:28.080
Baggos and ladder ball and washers and croquet.

09:28.080 --> 09:30.400
Croquet is my new jam.

09:30.400 --> 09:32.000
If you guys haven't played croquet, go to Target,

09:32.000 --> 09:34.400
buy yourself a $30 croquet set, get a bunch of people together,

09:34.400 --> 09:36.160
drink mimosas and play croquet all day.

09:36.160 --> 09:39.040
I would love it if croquet would have a big resurgence.

09:39.040 --> 09:42.960
I'm trying to get it started here in the ATX, but it's hard.

09:42.960 --> 09:43.440
It's hard.

09:43.440 --> 09:45.200
We're so separated from the rest of the country.

09:46.000 --> 09:46.480
What about-

09:48.800 --> 09:49.520
No, I got nothing.

09:52.080 --> 09:53.680
I like that honesty.

09:53.680 --> 09:55.120
Polo, that's what I was going for.

09:55.120 --> 09:56.800
Polo, polo.

09:56.800 --> 09:58.400
We need more horse-based sports.

10:00.320 --> 10:02.960
We need to be more honest about the production of this show, Travis.

10:02.960 --> 10:03.520
I like that.

10:03.520 --> 10:07.600
So when Griffin was talking about mimosas and croquet,

10:07.600 --> 10:11.200
I should have just said some sort of Downton Abbey reference

10:11.200 --> 10:12.240
that I can't come up with.

10:12.240 --> 10:12.880
Yeah.

10:12.880 --> 10:16.800
There's something about the guy Carter.

10:16.800 --> 10:18.320
Is that his name?

10:18.320 --> 10:18.880
Fuck.

10:19.440 --> 10:20.640
Mr. Bates.

10:20.640 --> 10:21.600
Mr. Bates.

10:21.600 --> 10:23.280
Good croquet.

10:23.280 --> 10:24.080
God damn it.

10:24.720 --> 10:25.280
You got me.

10:27.280 --> 10:29.120
So maybe try fencing.

10:29.120 --> 10:30.800
No one knows how you're really supposed to do that.

10:30.800 --> 10:31.360
Don't do that.

10:31.360 --> 10:32.560
Don't fucking do that.

10:32.560 --> 10:34.400
No, don't fucking do that.

10:34.400 --> 10:35.360
It's just sword fighting.

10:35.920 --> 10:37.120
Trapeze artist.

10:37.120 --> 10:37.920
Trapezing.

10:37.920 --> 10:38.880
No one knows how to do that.

10:38.880 --> 10:40.400
Now that you could get Jack.

10:40.400 --> 10:43.120
What if he broke his back, put the weight right back on?

10:43.120 --> 10:44.080
You want that heat?

10:44.080 --> 10:46.320
Then it becomes a Lifetime movie and it's awesome.

10:47.680 --> 10:48.800
The Griffin McElroy story.

10:48.800 --> 10:51.840
I lost my fat, but then I broke my back and I found it again.

10:51.840 --> 10:53.440
And then I fell down.

10:53.440 --> 10:54.880
Then I put my pants on the infield.

10:54.880 --> 10:57.600
A little bit while people watched me, the Griffin McElroy story.

10:58.320 --> 11:00.480
And my fat is played by Jack Black.

11:00.480 --> 11:03.280
It's a pretty good movie.

11:03.280 --> 11:04.160
What's he doing?

11:04.160 --> 11:04.960
Nothing.

11:04.960 --> 11:06.160
Gulliver travels tubes.

11:06.720 --> 11:07.520
Still traveling.

11:08.320 --> 11:09.040
How about a Yahoo?

11:09.920 --> 11:10.720
Hit me.

11:10.720 --> 11:14.160
This one was sent in by Lisa Holifield.

11:14.160 --> 11:14.800
Thank you, Lisa.

11:14.800 --> 11:17.840
It's by Yahoo Answers user, the Leviathan, who asks,

11:18.720 --> 11:20.880
how do you prepare for a staring contest?

11:22.240 --> 11:24.880
I always get into a staring contest with my cousin when I see him.

11:24.880 --> 11:27.520
And I want to prepare to finally beat him over the holidays.

11:27.520 --> 11:29.440
What can I do to become a champ?

11:29.440 --> 11:31.600
This is a good sport you get into, right?

11:33.040 --> 11:34.560
Step one, training montage.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.920
She loves her cousin, right?

11:37.920 --> 11:39.520
I mean, by staring contest,

11:39.520 --> 11:42.480
she means staring at her cousin who's staring at her.

11:42.480 --> 11:44.320
Just deep F me eyes.

11:44.320 --> 11:48.480
Just wanting to break Colonel Law's, Travis.

11:48.480 --> 11:49.520
What, what?

11:49.520 --> 11:50.400
F me eyes?

11:51.040 --> 11:51.840
F me eyes.

11:51.840 --> 11:53.440
I censored myself.

11:53.440 --> 11:55.120
I'm not surprised at you.

11:56.400 --> 11:57.840
Thank you, Justin.

11:57.840 --> 12:00.080
Look, this is my brother and my brother in 2012.

12:00.080 --> 12:01.200
It's about honesty.

12:01.200 --> 12:02.800
I believe you said that.

12:02.800 --> 12:04.400
Valentine's Day is coming up.

12:04.400 --> 12:09.120
What can we do to make people's lovers give them F me eyes?

12:12.000 --> 12:13.520
Staring contest, you're going to,

12:13.520 --> 12:15.440
step one, you're going to want to moisturize.

12:15.440 --> 12:15.680
Yeah.

12:16.800 --> 12:20.080
Is applying Visine during a staring contest legal?

12:20.080 --> 12:20.880
Is that allowed?

12:20.880 --> 12:23.360
As long as you don't blink, if you could do that blinkless.

12:23.360 --> 12:25.840
Then you're a fucking robot with robot eyes.

12:25.840 --> 12:26.160
Yeah.

12:26.160 --> 12:27.120
Oh, robot eyes.

12:27.120 --> 12:28.640
Steve Forbes up in this bitch.

12:28.640 --> 12:32.480
Stab both your eyes out, put some glass in there.

12:33.600 --> 12:36.560
You'll never, I don't think you'll have to moisten them.

12:36.560 --> 12:38.400
Wait, do you mean just like shards of glass

12:38.400 --> 12:39.680
or like a fake eyeball?

12:39.680 --> 12:41.440
Glass eyeballs, not shards of glass.

12:41.440 --> 12:44.240
Okay, shards of glass is a very intimidating technique.

12:44.240 --> 12:44.480
Yeah.

12:45.120 --> 12:46.640
I don't see how that helps you.

12:48.880 --> 12:50.560
Can I get a clarification on this?

12:51.200 --> 12:54.320
I find that I travel all around this great, great blue globe

12:54.320 --> 12:57.040
and people have different definitions of staring contest.

12:57.040 --> 12:59.840
Growing up in my neck of the woods, it was if you.

12:59.840 --> 13:00.240
Laugh.

13:00.240 --> 13:02.000
If you blinked, you lose.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.520
If you blinked, you're out.

13:03.520 --> 13:04.800
If you blinked, you're out.

13:04.800 --> 13:07.760
But a lot of people seem to roll with,

13:07.760 --> 13:09.600
if you smile or laugh, you out.

13:09.600 --> 13:10.880
It's about keeping a straight face.

13:11.600 --> 13:13.680
No, then that could just go on forever.

13:14.720 --> 13:16.160
See, Griffin knew what I was talking about though.

13:16.160 --> 13:16.880
Griffin complete.

13:16.880 --> 13:17.600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

13:17.600 --> 13:18.400
That's how we did it.

13:18.400 --> 13:19.440
I've heard it.

13:19.440 --> 13:20.160
Do you know what it was?

13:20.160 --> 13:23.600
It was a lot of kids were doing it the original,

13:23.600 --> 13:28.240
the original full game version of staring contest,

13:29.840 --> 13:31.200
and they were going blind.

13:32.560 --> 13:33.760
They were just going blind.

13:33.760 --> 13:39.120
And so the academia, the public education system

13:39.120 --> 13:40.720
of this great nation of ours,

13:41.600 --> 13:45.040
sort of enforced the second rule set

13:45.040 --> 13:46.480
and taught that to my generation

13:47.200 --> 13:49.360
so that our perfect peepers would remain.

13:50.080 --> 13:51.760
And then when that started to get boring,

13:51.760 --> 13:53.600
they introduced pogs.

13:53.600 --> 13:55.200
They actually recorded a lot of,

13:55.200 --> 13:56.880
there was a lot of public awareness.

13:56.880 --> 13:57.760
The same people who did,

13:58.800 --> 14:00.080
I'm not gonna play Sun City,

14:00.800 --> 14:01.920
did a tribute song.

14:02.720 --> 14:04.000
If you care, please don't stare.

14:05.200 --> 14:08.160
That was kind of swept the airwaves.

14:08.160 --> 14:11.520
Lionel Richie, I think, co-wrote that with Andrew Dice Clay,

14:11.520 --> 14:12.560
which was kind of a weird pair.

14:12.560 --> 14:15.520
And then there was the one, stop and think

14:15.520 --> 14:16.800
and then take a blink.

14:16.800 --> 14:17.360
Yeah, right.

14:17.360 --> 14:18.400
I really liked that one.

14:18.400 --> 14:19.680
Who co-wrote that, Trav?

14:19.680 --> 14:20.880
Because I was trying to remember.

14:20.880 --> 14:25.440
I think that was Elton John and Billy Joel together.

14:25.440 --> 14:26.320
It was amazing.

14:26.960 --> 14:27.760
Okay, yeah.

14:29.120 --> 14:33.840
There was a redo of the Donald O'Connor song,

14:33.840 --> 14:34.560
Make Them Laugh,

14:35.120 --> 14:36.000
called Make Them Laugh,

14:36.720 --> 14:39.040
colon the new rule set for staring contest.

14:39.760 --> 14:40.000
Right.

14:40.800 --> 14:42.640
For God's sake, make them laugh.

14:42.640 --> 14:43.520
Who co-wrote that?

14:43.520 --> 14:44.240
I forget.

14:44.240 --> 14:46.080
It was originally written by Donald O'Connor,

14:46.080 --> 14:50.960
but the new version was written by Rosie O'Donnell.

14:50.960 --> 14:51.840
And Donald Loege.

14:52.720 --> 14:53.920
That's weird.

14:53.920 --> 14:54.480
That's weird.

14:54.480 --> 14:56.560
And I know that there was another one,

14:58.800 --> 15:03.600
song for about blinking.

15:06.720 --> 15:07.600
Laugh.

15:07.600 --> 15:09.440
And that one was by Tears for Fears.

15:09.440 --> 15:14.000
That one was by Tears for Fears and an Infant Lady Gaga.

15:14.000 --> 15:17.360
Embryo Gaga.

15:17.360 --> 15:20.240
I basically wanted to say Infant Lady Gaga

15:20.800 --> 15:22.960
and didn't come up with the part with the song.

15:22.960 --> 15:25.600
So I kind of, I don't know if you guys could notice,

15:25.600 --> 15:27.600
but I kind of flubbed my way through that.

15:27.600 --> 15:29.280
No, no, you totally covered it.

15:29.280 --> 15:29.840
Malcolm to the-

15:29.840 --> 15:30.400
Did I nail it?

15:30.400 --> 15:32.320
The Mabim Bam Sausage Factory.

15:33.520 --> 15:35.760
We're taking you inside with director's commentary.

15:35.760 --> 15:37.120
Going deep.

15:37.120 --> 15:38.880
2012, deep cut.

15:38.880 --> 15:42.480
Sorry, guys.

15:42.480 --> 15:43.440
I've got a lot of coughs.

15:44.080 --> 15:45.520
You should get all those coughs out.

15:45.520 --> 15:46.240
Find a head cold.

15:46.240 --> 15:46.960
I'm zinking up.

15:48.080 --> 15:48.960
You know, I'm doing everything.

15:48.960 --> 15:50.240
I got my Akai.

15:50.240 --> 15:51.760
I got my Blackberry.

15:51.760 --> 15:52.800
It is pronounced Acai.

15:53.600 --> 15:54.640
Acai.

15:54.640 --> 15:55.120
Okay.

15:55.120 --> 15:55.840
I got my Akai.

15:55.840 --> 15:56.720
I got my Blackberry.

15:56.720 --> 15:58.080
I got everything that I need.

15:58.080 --> 15:58.720
Can I make a rec?

15:59.600 --> 16:00.080
Yeah, please.

16:00.080 --> 16:01.040
Can I drop a rec on you?

16:01.760 --> 16:02.320
Hit me.

16:02.320 --> 16:02.800
Goji.

16:03.840 --> 16:04.240
Goji.

16:04.240 --> 16:04.960
Goji?

16:04.960 --> 16:08.000
Oh, it tastes like fish jizz,

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
but oh, man, is it gonna-

16:10.000 --> 16:10.880
Let's call the row.

16:10.880 --> 16:13.520
It is going to fix you up right.

16:14.320 --> 16:16.080
And then maybe you need to get flavor blasted.

16:16.800 --> 16:18.720
You can flavor blast the goji.

16:19.680 --> 16:21.840
I haven't found anything that you can put in the goji

16:21.840 --> 16:23.040
to make it palatable,

16:23.040 --> 16:25.280
but good luck to you.

16:26.160 --> 16:26.400
Yeah.

16:26.960 --> 16:28.880
Hey, one of my best friends wants me

16:28.880 --> 16:30.960
to take a trip to Chicago with her.

16:30.960 --> 16:32.080
I've never been there before,

16:32.080 --> 16:33.520
and it seems like a pretty cool place,

16:33.520 --> 16:34.800
to which I'm sure Griffin could attest.

16:34.800 --> 16:35.520
Yep.

16:35.520 --> 16:38.000
So naturally, I'm totally down.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.200
However, there's a twist.

16:39.760 --> 16:41.840
My friend is planning on bringing her boyfriend,

16:41.840 --> 16:43.440
and now I'm wondering whether or not

16:43.440 --> 16:44.880
I should really be going.

16:44.880 --> 16:46.000
Can you guys please advise me

16:46.000 --> 16:48.800
on how to navigate the perils of third wheeledom,

16:48.800 --> 16:52.960
and whether a trip I'd like to take

16:52.960 --> 16:54.640
is worth the potential awkwardness

16:54.640 --> 16:55.840
that could be incurred?

16:55.840 --> 16:58.400
And that's from the Vancouver Voyager.

16:59.360 --> 17:01.360
Important detail here that they left out.

17:01.360 --> 17:03.120
This is a guy asking the question.

17:03.120 --> 17:04.640
Okay.

17:04.640 --> 17:08.160
So it's a guy and his female best friend,

17:08.160 --> 17:09.200
and her boyfriend.

17:10.720 --> 17:11.200
Oh yeah.

17:11.760 --> 17:13.680
Oh God, I'm so glad you clarified,

17:13.680 --> 17:15.680
because yes, that is going to be kind of weird.

17:15.680 --> 17:16.000
Yes.

17:17.040 --> 17:18.800
So it's more like the Vancouver Voyer.

17:20.000 --> 17:20.560
Yes.

17:20.560 --> 17:22.000
He plays his cards right.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.760
Now, this is the one,

17:23.760 --> 17:25.120
before we get too into it,

17:25.120 --> 17:26.240
I will say this.

17:26.240 --> 17:28.560
If the friend invited you first,

17:28.560 --> 17:30.480
and the plan was like the two of you as friends

17:30.480 --> 17:31.600
were gonna go to Chicago,

17:31.600 --> 17:33.920
and then the boyfriend got invited along,

17:34.480 --> 17:36.400
that's a different situation

17:36.400 --> 17:39.520
than, hey, my boyfriend and I are gonna go to Chicago.

17:39.520 --> 17:40.880
Would you like to go with us?

17:40.880 --> 17:42.000
And it depends on,

17:42.560 --> 17:43.280
see, here's the thing.

17:43.280 --> 17:47.280
It depends entirely on what kind of dude the boyfriend is.

17:47.280 --> 17:47.760
Yeah.

17:48.320 --> 17:50.000
And the fact that you're writing us to ask

17:50.000 --> 17:51.760
makes me think that he's not the kind of dude

17:51.760 --> 17:53.120
that you wanna go on a road trip with,

17:53.120 --> 17:54.800
with his girlfriend, right?

17:54.800 --> 17:56.720
Like, if it's just a cool guy who's like,

17:56.720 --> 17:58.880
yeah, man, whatever, let's go hang out.

17:58.880 --> 18:00.560
All three of us, come on, we'll go see a movie.

18:00.560 --> 18:03.280
Yeah, is it gonna be like Ferris Bueller's Day Off?

18:03.280 --> 18:03.600
Yeah.

18:03.600 --> 18:04.400
You're Cameron.

18:04.400 --> 18:05.920
Oh, perfect.

18:05.920 --> 18:06.480
Right?

18:06.480 --> 18:08.640
I'll tell you the kind of guy he is.

18:08.640 --> 18:10.160
He's the kind of guy who said,

18:10.160 --> 18:12.560
you're going to Chicago with Kevin?

18:12.560 --> 18:14.000
Yeah, right, I'm coming with you.

18:14.000 --> 18:14.640
Oh, that's true.

18:14.640 --> 18:16.560
I can't leave you on watch, that's what happened.

18:16.560 --> 18:18.320
That's how it shook out, 100%.

18:18.320 --> 18:20.240
So I would guess, just to infer here,

18:20.880 --> 18:23.360
that the girl and the boyfriend

18:23.360 --> 18:25.440
have only been together like six months.

18:25.440 --> 18:29.920
Oh my God, we are fucking Sherlocking this.

18:29.920 --> 18:30.800
I know, right?

18:30.800 --> 18:32.160
I've been reading How to the Baskervilles

18:32.160 --> 18:32.720
and I'm on point.

18:32.720 --> 18:34.880
We are giving this the Cumberbatch treatment.

18:38.000 --> 18:38.960
So I would say like,

18:39.520 --> 18:42.640
even if there were no layers of like being a third wheel,

18:42.640 --> 18:45.760
you don't want to go because I don't think this guy likes you.

18:45.760 --> 18:47.680
Or at least he doesn't trust his girlfriend with you

18:47.680 --> 18:48.800
or something along the lines where

18:49.600 --> 18:53.520
it's awkward for levels I don't even think you realize yet.

18:53.520 --> 18:55.520
It is a trip you'd like to take,

18:55.520 --> 18:57.440
but if it's really a trip you'd like to take,

18:57.440 --> 18:58.880
you wouldn't be asking us about it.

18:58.880 --> 18:59.200
Yeah.

18:59.200 --> 19:00.240
You would just be going.

19:00.880 --> 19:02.960
There's something deep down in you that knows

19:03.520 --> 19:04.960
you're not going to have a fun time.

19:04.960 --> 19:05.920
It's going to be weird.

19:05.920 --> 19:06.320
Yeah.

19:06.320 --> 19:08.240
Also, if you're planning on fucking going

19:08.240 --> 19:11.760
in the middle of February, stop.

19:11.760 --> 19:13.200
Like don't do that.

19:13.200 --> 19:14.640
Chicago's awful then.

19:15.200 --> 19:15.600
Also-

19:15.600 --> 19:18.640
I went in April and it was still pretty brutal.

19:18.640 --> 19:20.720
Yeah, wait until July or something.

19:20.720 --> 19:22.560
That's when that city starts popping off.

19:22.560 --> 19:25.120
Man, if you really want to go, you could still go.

19:26.480 --> 19:29.040
It's not like it's a hard to get to destination,

19:29.040 --> 19:29.360
you know?

19:29.360 --> 19:30.960
If you're like, you know, I really want to go,

19:30.960 --> 19:32.720
I really want to visit Chicago,

19:32.720 --> 19:36.720
but maybe this opportunity isn't the opportunity for you.

19:36.720 --> 19:38.720
Maybe you set up your own trip with a friend.

19:38.720 --> 19:41.120
I thought you were restating for her

19:41.120 --> 19:43.280
that even if we said she couldn't go,

19:43.280 --> 19:44.480
she could still go.

19:44.480 --> 19:44.720
Like-

19:45.600 --> 19:46.160
No, no, no.

19:46.160 --> 19:47.520
What we say is binding.

19:47.520 --> 19:48.960
Our word is law.

19:48.960 --> 19:51.360
Legally binding decision that we're making here.

19:51.360 --> 19:52.720
Hey, he wrote in.

19:52.720 --> 19:53.760
This was his mistake.

19:53.760 --> 19:55.280
You shouldn't have asked if he wanted to go.

19:55.840 --> 19:56.560
Right.

19:56.560 --> 20:01.440
If you're just worried because of the social norms,

20:01.440 --> 20:03.280
it really depends on the dude.

20:03.280 --> 20:06.560
So if the dude's cool, then there's no reason not to.

20:06.560 --> 20:08.720
But I think you know the dude's not cool.

20:08.720 --> 20:09.360
Yeah.

20:09.360 --> 20:11.120
Also, the sleeping arrangement.

20:12.080 --> 20:12.960
What's the housing?

20:12.960 --> 20:14.160
Are you staying like in a hotel?

20:14.720 --> 20:16.240
Or do you guys know people there?

20:16.240 --> 20:17.360
Or what's the deal?

20:17.360 --> 20:19.520
Because if you're staying in a hotel and all three of you

20:19.520 --> 20:20.560
are going to be sharing a room,

20:21.760 --> 20:24.160
I think that is the deal breaker right there.

20:24.160 --> 20:24.400
Yeah.

20:24.400 --> 20:26.080
Yeah, I really do.

20:26.080 --> 20:29.440
I mean, like, you know if it's going to be good or not.

20:29.440 --> 20:32.560
Like, you know, trips are expensive

20:32.560 --> 20:33.760
and they take a long time.

20:34.320 --> 20:38.000
So if you have doubts now, like, just hold off.

20:38.000 --> 20:38.560
Yeah.

20:38.560 --> 20:41.680
Wait till they break up and then swoop on her.

20:41.680 --> 20:41.920
Yeah.

20:43.760 --> 20:45.840
I mean, you know the situation better than we do.

20:45.840 --> 20:47.200
And the fact that you wrote in-

20:47.200 --> 20:48.880
I think it's never stopped us before.

20:48.880 --> 20:49.440
That's true.

20:49.440 --> 20:51.840
But I think that we can all agree that the fact that this guy

20:51.840 --> 20:55.280
wrote in and asked means he knows the answer is not to go.

20:55.280 --> 20:57.200
But Chicago's so dope though.

20:57.200 --> 20:57.840
Yeah.

20:57.840 --> 20:59.200
So go another time.

20:59.200 --> 20:59.440
Go by yourself.

20:59.440 --> 21:00.720
Not in February.

21:00.720 --> 21:01.680
Yeah, go by yourself.

21:02.240 --> 21:03.840
Strike up a conversation with somebody.

21:04.560 --> 21:06.480
Just have you ever seen Midnight in Paris?

21:06.480 --> 21:08.240
Just be like that, Midnight in Chicago.

21:08.240 --> 21:11.840
Or Lost in Translation and go and meet Scarlett Johansson.

21:11.840 --> 21:14.320
Or Before Sunrise, Before Sunset.

21:14.320 --> 21:14.880
Both of them.

21:16.560 --> 21:19.280
Fall in love with a stranger on the L train.

21:19.280 --> 21:20.640
It's going to happen for you.

21:20.640 --> 21:22.320
Big things, 2012, 20 does.

21:23.280 --> 21:25.680
Upton Sinclair, he's from Chicago, right?

21:25.680 --> 21:26.560
I don't know.

21:26.560 --> 21:28.080
Sure, I think he had John Updike.

21:28.080 --> 21:29.760
I can never keep the two of them straight.

21:29.760 --> 21:30.000
Yeah.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.320
Guys, this Yahoo answer was-

21:33.280 --> 21:34.000
Should we Yahoo it?

21:34.640 --> 21:37.680
Yeah, I was about to ask you for one and then you fucking incepted me.

21:37.680 --> 21:38.240
All right, shh.

21:38.240 --> 21:38.880
I love it.

21:38.880 --> 21:40.560
This Yahoo was sent in by Lisa Holifield.

21:40.560 --> 21:41.680
Thank you, Lisa.

21:41.680 --> 21:44.800
Lisa is becoming, quickly, our top gold contributor.

21:44.800 --> 21:57.760
This question was asked by Rezxion, R-E-Z-X-I-A-N, Rezxion, or perhaps Rezxion.

21:58.640 --> 21:59.200
Oh no.

21:59.200 --> 22:00.640
Rezxion.

22:00.640 --> 22:02.960
Gucci Gucci Vinny Vinny Milly Milly Prada.

22:02.960 --> 22:05.760
Crayshon asks-

22:05.760 --> 22:07.280
Gucci Gucci Vinny Milly Milly Prada.

22:07.280 --> 22:11.040
Gucci Gucci Gucci Bichy Bichy Marijuana.

22:11.040 --> 22:14.800
What's up with these basic bitches?

22:18.560 --> 22:23.040
Rezxion asks, if you could assassinate any of the characters of Saved by the Bell,

22:23.040 --> 22:24.080
who would it be and how?

22:27.360 --> 22:31.360
Zack, Slater, Screech, Kelly, Lisa, Jessie, or Mr. Belding?

22:31.360 --> 22:37.760
I feel like that's really limiting because you're leaving out Max and Tori and whatever

22:37.760 --> 22:40.960
the character was that King or Queen's wife played.

22:40.960 --> 22:44.080
Oh, somebody did some quick Google research, I think.

22:44.640 --> 22:45.360
I did.

22:45.360 --> 22:47.760
I'm looking at the Saved by the Bell Wiki right now.

22:48.960 --> 22:51.120
Makes me sad that that exists, but go on.

22:51.120 --> 22:55.680
I've been saved by the internet and what was her name?

22:55.680 --> 22:56.400
Leah Remney.

22:56.400 --> 22:57.120
Who did you play?

22:58.240 --> 22:58.800
She played-

23:03.600 --> 23:04.800
This is a really good video.

23:04.800 --> 23:05.680
I'm going to save.

23:05.680 --> 23:06.800
Doesn't matter.

23:06.800 --> 23:08.320
Stacey Kurosi.

23:08.320 --> 23:09.920
Yeah, Kurosi.

23:09.920 --> 23:10.400
There it was.

23:13.040 --> 23:18.960
I would have to go with probably A.C. Slater.

23:18.960 --> 23:19.680
Oh my God.

23:20.640 --> 23:21.200
Why would you kill A.C. Slater?

23:21.200 --> 23:22.320
You actually answered it.

23:23.120 --> 23:24.640
Yeah, why would I kill A.C. Slater?

23:26.480 --> 23:26.960
I don't know.

23:28.000 --> 23:31.600
It would be like traveling back in time to kill Hitler when he was a baby.

23:32.560 --> 23:36.560
I would kill A.C. Slater so that he couldn't go on to host all the Miss America past.

23:36.560 --> 23:38.000
And do all that genocide.

23:40.000 --> 23:41.920
Do all that preppy related genocide.

23:42.480 --> 23:42.960
I'm sorry.

23:42.960 --> 23:44.800
That was in Saved by the Bell the college years.

23:44.800 --> 23:47.280
You probably didn't get to that subplot.

23:48.560 --> 23:49.840
I'll probably get to that here in a little bit.

23:50.560 --> 23:54.480
Can I kill all of the cast members of Saved by the Bell the new class?

23:56.640 --> 23:57.440
For their own good.

23:57.440 --> 23:58.640
Not the college years.

23:58.640 --> 23:59.680
No, there was college years.

23:59.680 --> 24:01.520
There was college years and there was also new class.

24:01.520 --> 24:07.440
Well, you know, the funny thing about this is that this is actually how Good Morning

24:07.440 --> 24:10.480
Miss Bliss ended was with the assassination of Miss Bliss.

24:10.480 --> 24:14.000
And it was the catalyst of Saved by the Bell.

24:14.000 --> 24:15.200
That's how Saved by the Bell started.

24:15.760 --> 24:16.800
As I'm going over this-

24:16.800 --> 24:18.800
Hayley Mel's character Miss Bliss was assassinated.

24:18.800 --> 24:22.880
As I'm going over this wiki, one of my favorite things that I've learned is that

24:23.440 --> 24:28.960
the creators and writers and the producers and everything don't give two shits about

24:28.960 --> 24:31.600
continuity in the Saved by the Bell universe.

24:31.600 --> 24:36.640
Cause like, so they, they canceled Good Morning Miss Bliss after like 12 episodes and relaunched

24:36.640 --> 24:37.600
it to Saved by the Bell.

24:38.240 --> 24:42.560
And so then when they sold it into syndication, they just kind of wrapped the Good Morning

24:42.560 --> 24:44.640
Miss Bliss episodes into it.

24:44.640 --> 24:45.440
And they're like, fuck it.

24:45.440 --> 24:46.640
No one will notice.

24:46.640 --> 24:48.000
And nobody did.

24:48.000 --> 24:49.120
They're kids, Donald.

24:49.680 --> 24:50.240
They're kids.

24:51.440 --> 24:52.640
Kids are stupid.

24:52.640 --> 24:57.680
They just love Zach's hair and they love romance between him and Kelly Kapowski.

24:57.680 --> 25:00.400
You see, he said time out and he had like a phone and shit.

25:00.400 --> 25:01.280
It's awesome.

25:01.280 --> 25:05.920
But I would, I would of course assassinate Zach because you do that, the infrastructure

25:05.920 --> 25:07.280
crumbles and you can slip in there.

25:07.280 --> 25:08.800
And then you're the cool guy.

25:08.800 --> 25:10.160
You can't let anyone know you did it.

25:10.160 --> 25:15.280
What you're failing to take into account, Justin, is that all of this is the dream of

25:16.880 --> 25:17.520
Zach Morris.

25:18.320 --> 25:19.280
Oh shit.

25:19.280 --> 25:24.240
He's staring into a snow globe while his dad and mom sit in the corner going, he just

25:24.240 --> 25:29.280
stares at it all day long when he when he freezes time.

25:29.280 --> 25:31.120
He actually is talking to his therapist.

25:31.120 --> 25:36.960
Yeah, we need to consider this question a little more deeply because you don't.

25:36.960 --> 25:37.360
Hold on.

25:37.360 --> 25:38.080
Sorry to interrupt.

25:38.640 --> 25:43.440
Is it possible that all the characters on Saved by the Bell represent different aspects

25:43.440 --> 25:49.760
of Zach Morris's psyche and Screech is like his nerdy, like self-conscious side and Jesse

25:49.760 --> 25:54.960
is like his empowered feminist side and A.C. Slater is like his jock, like, you know, powerful

25:54.960 --> 25:55.680
manly side.

25:55.680 --> 25:57.360
Mr. Belding is his impotent side.

25:58.800 --> 26:02.480
His bonerless side and Max is his magician side.

26:03.120 --> 26:08.720
I think the problem with your theory is that Lisa Turtle was on the show and I think we

26:08.720 --> 26:10.720
can all agree that Zach did not have a black side.

26:12.800 --> 26:13.760
Okay, you got me.

26:14.880 --> 26:15.360
There's no, there's nothing.

26:15.360 --> 26:16.960
You fo' told through my theory.

26:16.960 --> 26:23.840
Let's let's back up really quick because first off, I don't think you assassinate a Saved

26:23.840 --> 26:24.720
by the Bell character.

26:24.720 --> 26:26.400
I think you can only murder them.

26:27.040 --> 26:32.320
I think I think if you kill Zach or A.C. Slater, it's a murder and not an assassination.

26:33.040 --> 26:33.600
Right?

26:33.600 --> 26:34.400
What's the difference?

26:34.960 --> 26:38.160
I thought you were going to say that you can't murder them because they're all vampires.

26:39.040 --> 26:41.760
Well, that but I don't only slay them.

26:41.760 --> 26:48.080
You assassinate a king or a political figure, but you murder a high school student.

26:48.080 --> 26:50.640
I would assassinate Senator Zach Morris.

26:52.560 --> 26:58.240
I mean, to be to be fair, Zach is basically the king of Bayside High.

26:58.800 --> 27:01.520
I think he may have even referred to himself as such.

27:01.520 --> 27:03.040
Justin, point of order.

27:03.040 --> 27:07.760
If you remember, Zach is actually of Native American descent, so he would have been chief

27:07.760 --> 27:08.640
of Bayside High.

27:08.640 --> 27:10.800
Ah, that's true.

27:10.800 --> 27:16.880
That's just that's as we learned from the terrific episode in which Zach ran track for

27:16.880 --> 27:18.400
all of one episode.

27:18.400 --> 27:20.160
Yeah, he got their kids.

27:20.160 --> 27:23.120
Donald won't notice the kids.

27:23.120 --> 27:24.080
They all look the same.

27:24.960 --> 27:27.760
That's actually how the high school wars were started.

27:27.760 --> 27:34.960
Is that Archduke Zach Morris was assassinated by one of the cast of the cast of California

27:34.960 --> 27:38.960
Dreams actually assassinated Archduke Zach Morris.

27:38.960 --> 27:44.880
And that was the start of and the problem is, is that the kids from California Dreams

27:44.880 --> 27:51.280
had a signed treaty with the cast of Hang Loose that in the event of war, you have to

27:51.280 --> 27:52.160
fight with us.

27:52.160 --> 27:56.240
And, you know, pretty soon it just got rid of the Zach attack proclamation.

27:57.440 --> 27:57.680
Right.

27:57.680 --> 27:58.400
That's correct.

27:58.400 --> 27:59.200
All recall.

28:00.240 --> 28:04.000
Let's play a game called the shot heard around Bayside.

28:04.000 --> 28:07.920
Let's play a game called who on Yahoo Answers scares the shit out of me the most.

28:08.960 --> 28:09.280
Okay.

28:09.280 --> 28:14.240
Is it best answer submitter art Yana who replies AC Slater?

28:14.240 --> 28:16.160
I don't know how, but I'd make it painful.

28:17.040 --> 28:17.440
Whoa.

28:18.080 --> 28:18.720
Okay.

28:18.720 --> 28:24.080
Is it cutie pie 1987 who says Kelly suffocation on pom poms?

28:24.880 --> 28:25.440
Wow.

28:25.440 --> 28:27.440
Is it Chris who said screech?

28:27.440 --> 28:28.320
I would choke him.

28:28.320 --> 28:29.200
I hate his voice.

28:30.240 --> 28:31.600
Jesus Christ.

28:31.600 --> 28:33.120
Was it James A?

28:33.120 --> 28:35.440
It was James A who responded.

28:35.440 --> 28:37.680
I would handcuff them all together in a circle.

28:37.680 --> 28:41.600
Then I would stand in the center wearing body armor and drop a live hand grenade.

28:41.600 --> 28:44.000
Whoever lived would be subsequently beheaded.

28:45.200 --> 28:45.680
Wow.

28:46.480 --> 28:47.760
I would watch that movie.

28:47.760 --> 28:49.200
Dear internet.

28:49.200 --> 28:50.320
This is Travis.

28:50.320 --> 28:51.200
We're breaking up.

28:51.920 --> 28:53.120
Jesse's been a good run.

28:53.920 --> 28:54.400
Jesse.

28:54.400 --> 28:58.080
I'd make her watch show girls over and over again until she killed herself.

28:58.800 --> 28:59.520
Wow.

28:59.520 --> 29:00.480
Hey everybody.

29:00.480 --> 29:05.280
Maybe you don't remember, but Saved by a Bow, you loved it.

29:05.280 --> 29:05.920
You were cute.

29:05.920 --> 29:06.320
You loved it.

29:06.320 --> 29:07.600
You had good times.

29:07.600 --> 29:09.120
What's the matter with you?

29:09.120 --> 29:14.320
To be fair, Elizabeth Berkley already committed career suicide with Showgirls.

29:14.320 --> 29:14.800
So yeah.

29:14.800 --> 29:17.920
And if you're wondering what the number of times she would have to watch Showgirls to

29:17.920 --> 29:20.080
kill herself is, it's 1.2.

29:20.080 --> 29:28.000
Guys, Brynn McDonald 2005 said Jesse, because she was one of the ones who left for most of

29:28.000 --> 29:31.760
the show and returned only till the end for Kelly and Zach's wedding.

29:31.760 --> 29:33.840
I would have her fall out her window room.

29:35.040 --> 29:35.360
Wow.

29:36.160 --> 29:38.160
Jesse, you fair weather bitch.

29:39.920 --> 29:40.400
Wow.

29:40.960 --> 29:41.200
Yeah.

29:41.200 --> 29:43.360
She's there when it suits her.

29:43.360 --> 29:44.080
Yeah.

29:44.080 --> 29:47.760
I would kill Tori Scott because clearly she is a phantasm.

29:48.480 --> 29:49.680
We just kill nobody.

29:49.680 --> 29:53.280
Can we not kill anybody on this fictional kids show?

29:53.280 --> 29:53.840
You fuck.

29:54.960 --> 29:55.840
It's over.

29:55.840 --> 30:02.400
The fact that the show no longer persists, although you know that reunion special is

30:02.400 --> 30:03.680
just around the corner.

30:03.680 --> 30:05.600
America's dying for it.

30:05.600 --> 30:08.400
You're, of course, not counting my fan fiction, correct?

30:08.400 --> 30:09.360
Oh, no, no, no.

30:09.360 --> 30:11.200
That's in a splinter universe.

30:11.200 --> 30:11.840
Okay, thank you.

30:11.840 --> 30:14.720
That's canon T for Travis.

30:14.720 --> 30:17.520
I'm talking about canon B for Bayside.

30:17.520 --> 30:23.360
Do you think Dustin Diamond will be allowed into any sort of reunion special after having

30:23.360 --> 30:25.680
publicly smeared doo doo on a woman's face?

30:28.080 --> 30:29.520
Well, that is so screech.

30:30.160 --> 30:32.080
It is not screech, sir.

30:32.080 --> 30:34.320
Something screech would have done in my fan fiction.

30:34.320 --> 30:35.200
Sir, I protest.

30:36.720 --> 30:38.000
Guys, I'm not kidding you.

30:38.000 --> 30:40.640
There are dozens of answers on here that are like screech.

30:40.640 --> 30:41.680
He's so annoying.

30:42.160 --> 30:44.480
You guys don't have to watch screech anymore.

30:46.240 --> 30:46.800
You're safe.

30:46.800 --> 30:54.400
If you see screech at all, it's by your own screech because he caused my nightmare.

30:54.400 --> 30:55.440
How was your day?

30:55.440 --> 30:56.000
Pretty bad.

30:56.000 --> 30:57.600
It got screeched over.

30:57.600 --> 31:01.120
It's just like he kept, he was in my periphery the whole time.

31:01.120 --> 31:03.920
Why haven't I changed my desktop wallpaper?

31:03.920 --> 31:08.080
Maybe these are people talking about how annoying Dustin Diamond is because they're frequent

31:08.080 --> 31:10.320
visitors to the Chipotle in Petaluma.

31:10.320 --> 31:17.040
Every time he's like, beans or beef?

31:17.040 --> 31:21.120
And I'm like, I sort of leap across the counter and fucking murder him.

31:21.120 --> 31:25.360
Griffin, in those answers, how many of them are like, Zach Morris because I love him so

31:25.360 --> 31:27.920
much and if I can't have him, nobody can?

31:27.920 --> 31:30.400
I would want to put him in a jar in my basement.

31:33.360 --> 31:34.000
Nobody did.

31:34.720 --> 31:35.280
Nobody?

31:35.280 --> 31:36.720
Mostly just screech or Jesse.

31:36.720 --> 31:41.520
I would say Kelly Kapowski and I'd kill her with kisses.

31:43.440 --> 31:44.880
And suffocate her with pumpkins.

31:44.880 --> 31:46.000
That's just horrifying.

31:46.000 --> 31:47.920
No, you took a wrong turn.

31:47.920 --> 31:50.640
My friend just got dumped after a little over a month.

31:50.640 --> 31:53.600
His lady seemed to be really great for him, but things just went sour.

31:53.600 --> 31:58.000
But now the proper time of morning is over and I need a friend back.

31:58.000 --> 32:03.360
Brothers, should I force feed my dear friend his first bite of the recovery sandwich?

32:03.360 --> 32:06.240
And that's from Need My Friend in New York City.

32:07.680 --> 32:12.240
I think in the rules of the recovery sandwich, I don't think it's something you can force feed.

32:12.240 --> 32:13.600
Oh, that's not true.

32:13.600 --> 32:14.000
You think?

32:14.800 --> 32:17.920
I think by the very nature of the recovery sandwich, it's something somebody's forced

32:17.920 --> 32:18.320
feeding you.

32:18.320 --> 32:20.080
I think more often than not, it's force fed.

32:22.080 --> 32:25.280
Here's my problem with this question, New York City.

32:25.280 --> 32:31.840
The intent is maybe noble, but your motivation is all screwy.

32:31.840 --> 32:32.320
Yeah.

32:32.320 --> 32:36.320
Everything I'm hearing from you is about what you need and how you need your friend back

32:36.320 --> 32:39.360
and what he is to you.

32:39.360 --> 32:49.520
Like if you want him to break out of the funk, it has to be about him wanting him to get

32:49.520 --> 32:53.680
out of it or like him wanting to get out of it or you wanting him to get out of it.

32:53.680 --> 32:57.120
Him wanting to get out of it or you wanting him out of it because it's what's best for

32:58.080 --> 32:58.480
him.

32:58.480 --> 33:00.720
And that's not what I'm hearing right now.

33:00.720 --> 33:06.240
Let's all just acknowledge that the elephant in the room, that being that you are probably

33:06.240 --> 33:08.480
the reason that his relationship didn't work out.

33:08.480 --> 33:10.160
Now, what are you basing that on Griffin?

33:13.360 --> 33:14.640
He needs it so much.

33:14.640 --> 33:15.600
He needs him.

33:15.600 --> 33:22.400
And when you get a need that is that strong and that deep, you get that's a guaranteed

33:22.400 --> 33:23.760
Dupree.

33:23.760 --> 33:29.200
Okay, so you're not saying that the end of the he caused it by like cheating with the

33:29.200 --> 33:30.000
girl on him.

33:30.000 --> 33:31.760
You know, very presence.

33:31.760 --> 33:36.240
He I have not seen you, me and Dupree, but I don't think that cheating happens.

33:36.240 --> 33:41.200
I just think that there's a there's a there's an anchor that weighs that ship of love down

33:41.200 --> 33:44.320
to the bottom of the ocean and that anchor is Dupree.

33:44.320 --> 33:48.240
You know, I also have not seen you, me and Dupree, but I'm almost certain that it doesn't

33:48.240 --> 33:52.480
end with the woman leaving and Dupree saying, well, at least we still have each other.

33:52.480 --> 33:54.880
Justin, did you see you, me and Dupree?

33:54.880 --> 33:56.320
Can you clear this up for us?

33:57.360 --> 33:58.560
I saw Marmaduke.

34:00.080 --> 34:03.840
And at the end of that, he's a dog acting like a human.

34:04.480 --> 34:07.920
I thought you were going to say at the end of that, he gives a synopsis of you, me and

34:07.920 --> 34:08.800
Dupree.

34:08.800 --> 34:13.520
At the end of it, he's like, well, I guess we've all learned a lot here, but not as much

34:13.520 --> 34:15.840
as I learned watching you, me and Dupree.

34:15.840 --> 34:20.160
In that charming film, Mr. Sarah Owen Wilson.

34:20.720 --> 34:21.200
So wait.

34:21.200 --> 34:22.800
OK, I need a whole backup.

34:23.440 --> 34:24.480
You, me and Dupree.

34:25.520 --> 34:26.240
Marmaduke.

34:26.880 --> 34:27.280
Gotcha.

34:28.800 --> 34:29.840
And the one where he-

34:29.840 --> 34:31.760
No, Marley and Me.

34:31.760 --> 34:33.680
What is what is his game?

34:33.680 --> 34:35.120
What what is he playing at?

34:35.120 --> 34:39.280
Marley and Me is like a remix of those two movies, but it came out before Marmaduke.

34:40.320 --> 34:41.680
What's his story?

34:41.680 --> 34:43.920
Wait, is Marmaduke in Marley and Me?

34:43.920 --> 34:45.520
Because if so, I'll watch that movie.

34:45.520 --> 34:48.320
No, but it's part of the Marley and Me verse.

34:48.320 --> 34:49.040
Right.

34:49.040 --> 34:49.920
The Marley verse.

34:49.920 --> 34:50.720
It's canon M.

34:51.600 --> 34:52.560
It's canon M of the Marley verse.

34:52.560 --> 34:56.800
Marmaduke is the Lobo to Marley's Superman.

34:56.800 --> 34:57.040
Right.

34:57.040 --> 35:00.720
You know, have you seen Marley and Me Terrible Twos?

35:01.760 --> 35:02.160
Yeah.

35:02.160 --> 35:02.960
Is that a thing?

35:03.520 --> 35:06.400
Yeah, I watched that back to back with Space Buddies.

35:07.760 --> 35:11.920
It's a it's a prequel to Marley and Me, even though everybody knows that in Marley and

35:11.920 --> 35:13.680
Me, the dog fucking dies.

35:13.680 --> 35:17.200
So here's the prequel of this dead ass dog as a puppy.

35:17.200 --> 35:21.280
Also, Owen Wilson is there and he's staying at his friend's place with his girlfriend.

35:24.400 --> 35:26.480
So back to the recovery sandwich.

35:26.480 --> 35:30.160
Back to the recovery sandwich, you philanderer.

35:31.840 --> 35:32.880
That's not the right word.

35:32.880 --> 35:33.680
Philanthropist.

35:34.240 --> 35:35.200
You philanthropist.

35:37.200 --> 35:42.480
Yeah, I think I think your motivations are whack, but you should still still do this for him.

35:42.480 --> 35:44.240
He's he's ready. How long has it been?

35:45.120 --> 35:45.840
A month.

35:45.840 --> 35:46.320
A month.

35:46.320 --> 35:47.120
He may not be ready.

35:47.760 --> 35:51.520
Yeah, I was gonna say it depends on how long the relationship was.

35:51.520 --> 35:54.240
My friend just got out of a seven year long relationship.

35:54.240 --> 35:55.280
It's been a month.

35:55.280 --> 35:56.320
Come on, buddy.

35:56.320 --> 35:56.800
I know that.

35:56.800 --> 35:59.600
I know what I said a second ago, but he meant, you know what?

35:59.600 --> 36:01.840
He may just be stretching his bachelor legs.

36:02.400 --> 36:07.280
You know, he may just be enjoying eating Hot Pockets and watching, you know,

36:07.840 --> 36:10.000
Arnold Schwarzenegger maybe still three o'clock in the morning.

36:10.000 --> 36:10.720
What does he care?

36:10.720 --> 36:14.480
Yeah, I know whenever I got dumped,

36:14.480 --> 36:19.200
all I did was chew down on some Lean Pockets and watch Junior over and over again.

36:20.320 --> 36:23.360
I just watched Twins and cried for so many reasons.

36:23.360 --> 36:26.720
I always knew when Griffin had been eating Lean Pockets and watching Junior

36:26.720 --> 36:28.720
because he called me three in the morning and said,

36:28.720 --> 36:29.840
I just want a baby.

36:31.680 --> 36:33.760
My biological clock is ticking.

36:35.200 --> 36:36.080
I'm 19.

36:36.080 --> 36:39.440
My man womb is barren.

36:39.440 --> 36:46.480
I'll never feel what it's like to have a life inside me besides these Lean Pockets.

36:46.480 --> 36:53.360
Is the bigger stretch logically required that a man gets pregnant in that movie

36:53.360 --> 36:55.440
or that Arnold Schwarzenegger is a scientist?

36:58.800 --> 36:59.920
It's harder to believe.

37:01.120 --> 37:02.720
It's sort of like jingle all the way.

37:02.720 --> 37:07.120
Is it hard to believe a man would turn a town upside down for a single action figure

37:07.120 --> 37:11.120
and fight Simba for it or that Arnold Schwarzenegger is a dedicated father?

37:12.240 --> 37:14.400
What's harder to wrap your mind around?

37:15.440 --> 37:17.680
That's the problem with any Arnold Schwarzenegger movie

37:17.680 --> 37:21.920
where he's not like ripping enemy skulls out of their heads.

37:21.920 --> 37:27.040
There's nothing to be said about playing against type, but right, man, I don't buy it.

37:27.680 --> 37:29.840
Arnold Schwarzenegger, he's a philanderer, right?

37:29.840 --> 37:30.720
That's right.

37:30.720 --> 37:32.240
That's the right thing.

37:32.240 --> 37:33.040
You've done that correctly.

37:33.040 --> 37:34.240
He is also a philanthropist.

37:34.240 --> 37:35.840
I would assume he makes a good deal of money.

37:36.480 --> 37:39.200
So maybe make your friend watch Junior.

37:39.200 --> 37:40.000
That doesn't help.

37:40.000 --> 37:43.520
I think after a month, he may not be ready to get back in the game.

37:43.520 --> 37:44.960
He will let you know.

37:44.960 --> 37:47.360
I mean, I just, I don't know.

37:48.240 --> 37:48.880
You're right, Travis.

37:48.880 --> 37:50.240
It's all about how long the relationship was.

37:50.240 --> 37:50.800
Yeah.

37:50.800 --> 37:51.600
A month.

37:51.600 --> 37:52.640
That might be pushing it.

37:53.200 --> 37:57.920
I think you could present the recovery sandwich to him and say like,

37:57.920 --> 38:03.840
hey, I'm thinking about maybe taking a trip to, I don't know, where are you in New York?

38:03.840 --> 38:04.720
Whatever.

38:04.720 --> 38:04.960
Yeah.

38:04.960 --> 38:09.840
So you can say like down to Atlantic city, you know, or maybe someplace that doesn't suck.

38:09.840 --> 38:13.200
But like, sounds like crappy swingers.

38:14.400 --> 38:14.960
Yeah.

38:14.960 --> 38:17.280
Hey, let's have a shitty swingers moment.

38:18.320 --> 38:21.280
But you know, maybe like try to set things up.

38:21.280 --> 38:22.960
And if he's like, no, man, I'm not in the mood.

38:22.960 --> 38:24.240
I don't want to do it.

38:24.240 --> 38:28.160
I think that it's been short enough that you have to respect that.

38:29.360 --> 38:32.080
That this isn't the time to like drag him out of his house.

38:32.080 --> 38:32.400
You know?

38:32.400 --> 38:32.800
I don't know.

38:32.800 --> 38:35.600
A month is a long time and you're going to, everyone dies.

38:35.600 --> 38:39.440
So I just take him out to a shitty club and just like, see what happens.

38:39.440 --> 38:39.680
Yeah.

38:39.680 --> 38:40.640
Let's just mix it up.

38:42.000 --> 38:42.800
And you know what?

38:42.800 --> 38:47.360
He's never going to be more attractive to the opposite sex than when he has no interest in

38:47.360 --> 38:48.320
being in a relationship.

38:48.880 --> 38:52.240
So now's the time to strike where the iron is.

38:53.360 --> 38:53.920
Lonely.

38:53.920 --> 38:54.880
So cold.

38:54.880 --> 38:55.920
So very, very cold.

38:55.920 --> 38:56.480
So cold.

38:57.200 --> 38:58.480
So ice, ice cold.

38:59.680 --> 39:05.920
We have a lot of famous friends that we've helped recover from bad relationships.

39:05.920 --> 39:11.280
And the way we ask that they repay us is by sending in a question to us.

39:11.280 --> 39:13.920
This week we have a second question by our good buddies,

39:14.640 --> 39:16.880
Chuck and Josh from Stuff You Should Know.

39:17.840 --> 39:20.160
So let's check it out right now.

39:21.040 --> 39:23.280
Hello, this is Josh.

39:23.280 --> 39:26.960
And that's Chuck from Stuff You Should Know, the podcast.

39:27.760 --> 39:28.240
That's right.

39:28.240 --> 39:31.200
And we have, well, you go ahead, Chuck.

39:31.200 --> 39:32.320
I have a question.

39:32.320 --> 39:35.760
And guys from my brother, my brother and me, thank you for having us on.

39:35.760 --> 39:36.160
Yes, thank you.

39:36.160 --> 39:37.920
And allowing us to ask you this question.

39:38.640 --> 39:43.280
Josh refuses to take part in this question, but I would like to know what the deal is

39:43.280 --> 39:44.880
with male grooming.

39:46.080 --> 39:50.880
And I'm not talking about eyebrows and ear hair and nose hair and head hair.

39:50.880 --> 39:53.120
I'm talking about other kinds of male grooming.

39:53.120 --> 39:54.480
And again, I want to make this point.

39:54.480 --> 39:55.680
This is Chuck's question.

39:55.680 --> 39:59.280
I reject any participation in this question.

39:59.280 --> 40:00.720
But I'm just glad to be on.

40:00.720 --> 40:01.840
I'm looking for tips, guys.

40:02.560 --> 40:04.720
Josh, first off, I want to first thank you, gentlemen.

40:04.720 --> 40:07.680
Josh, I want to say you made the right call not getting involved there.

40:07.680 --> 40:10.560
Chuck's driving this steamship.

40:11.360 --> 40:13.920
You just need to let him navigate into these waters.

40:14.480 --> 40:15.440
But we're here.

40:15.920 --> 40:17.280
There's nothing we won't talk about.

40:17.280 --> 40:22.560
I don't think you should be ashamed of your flora, as it were.

40:22.560 --> 40:22.800
Nope.

40:23.920 --> 40:27.520
Or if you don't have any down there and haven't been able to your entire life.

40:27.520 --> 40:28.720
That's nothing to be ashamed of.

40:28.720 --> 40:30.480
There's nothing to be ashamed of wearing a merkin.

40:31.280 --> 40:32.400
Oh, why?

40:32.400 --> 40:33.680
Now, what is that?

40:33.680 --> 40:34.240
A merkin?

40:34.240 --> 40:35.520
It's a pubic wig.

40:35.520 --> 40:36.320
You know what it is.

40:36.320 --> 40:37.760
They wear them in the movies.

40:37.760 --> 40:39.120
Yeah, like a hair donut.

40:40.000 --> 40:41.120
Oh, no.

40:41.120 --> 40:42.560
Yeah, deal with that image.

40:42.560 --> 40:42.880
Why?

40:43.760 --> 40:44.000
Why?

40:44.720 --> 40:45.040
Why?

40:46.160 --> 40:46.960
Why wouldn't you?

40:46.960 --> 40:48.480
No, why any of it?

40:48.480 --> 40:49.520
Why do you know it?

40:49.520 --> 40:50.320
Why does it exist?

40:50.320 --> 40:51.040
Why do I know it?

40:52.480 --> 40:53.600
Why to all?

40:53.600 --> 40:53.840
Why?

40:54.560 --> 40:55.760
It's just why over and over again.

40:55.760 --> 40:57.040
Just across the board why?

40:57.040 --> 40:59.040
What do you think people talk about at Zen Church?

41:04.080 --> 41:09.840
And now as we breathe peacefully and sit quietly, let us think on the humble merkin.

41:09.840 --> 41:10.720
Check this out.

41:10.720 --> 41:11.360
Merkins.

41:13.680 --> 41:15.440
What's the deal with merkins?

41:15.440 --> 41:17.360
Consider the merkin, align it.

41:18.000 --> 41:21.600
You know, I didn't really get into World of Warcraft until they let you be a merkin.

41:22.560 --> 41:26.960
I have a merkin warlock that is just unbeatable.

41:29.040 --> 41:35.840
Listen, sometimes a lady plays a lady actress in the 70s and they need a merkin down there.

41:35.840 --> 41:37.040
That's just that's just that.

41:37.040 --> 41:38.320
What did you think it was, Justin?

41:38.320 --> 41:39.040
Wedda works?

41:39.040 --> 41:40.240
Do you think it was Hollywood magic?

41:41.040 --> 41:42.880
CGI, huh?

41:42.880 --> 41:49.280
So I could I could I could tell the ladies that I'm trying to invent like a merkin bald cap

41:49.280 --> 41:51.120
and I'm I'm prototyping it.

41:51.120 --> 41:56.000
Would that be a believable scenario that I could try to put out there on the?

41:56.000 --> 41:57.680
I am learning more about you.

41:58.880 --> 42:01.920
Are you looking for an excuse to be baby smooth down there?

42:03.680 --> 42:05.120
Yes, yes.

42:05.120 --> 42:12.080
I think I either got to go bear bear merkin prototype or horrible fire accident.

42:12.080 --> 42:16.400
Yeah, oh, but horrible fire accident while saving a child from a burning building.

42:16.400 --> 42:17.200
With my penis.

42:17.200 --> 42:22.560
Grab on, we got to get out of here.

42:22.560 --> 42:26.800
The chopper, the ladder hanging from the helicopter isn't long enough.

42:27.600 --> 42:28.160
I know.

42:28.160 --> 42:28.720
I know.

42:29.920 --> 42:30.800
Grab my merkin.

42:30.800 --> 42:36.960
Grab my merkin, oh no, it tore off.

42:36.960 --> 42:38.480
Superman, you a freak.

42:41.520 --> 42:44.560
You nasty Superman, nasty.

42:47.120 --> 42:49.040
Can we give Chuck anything actionable?

42:49.040 --> 42:50.240
Go with the high top fade.

42:51.280 --> 42:53.360
OK, I have your basketball number.

42:53.360 --> 42:54.080
You go down.

42:54.080 --> 42:57.840
You go down to Earley's Barbershop and tell him you want a number, a number three.

42:58.960 --> 43:00.160
Number three with burns.

43:00.160 --> 43:03.280
Number three with burns and a lightning bolt shaved in.

43:04.320 --> 43:06.000
As I see it, you got two options.

43:07.040 --> 43:14.880
You either go full blown laissez faire like Van Morrison super bush.

43:18.880 --> 43:23.680
Or you fucking burn and salt the earth down there.

43:24.880 --> 43:29.040
You, you, you do psychological warfare down there.

43:29.040 --> 43:32.720
Yeah, Agent Orange shit.

43:34.080 --> 43:39.120
Oh, man, I could give real advice, but I just don't want to.

43:39.120 --> 43:40.240
Yeah, I don't want you to either.

43:40.880 --> 43:42.640
Fucking weird motherfucker.

43:42.640 --> 43:44.560
Keep it to yourself and your merkins.

43:44.560 --> 43:48.160
Ask your partner what style they prefer.

43:49.520 --> 43:51.120
Oh no, oh no.

43:51.120 --> 43:59.840
Okay, ask about erotic cornrows.

43:59.840 --> 44:03.120
What is the most sensuous way I could touch your undercarriage?

44:04.400 --> 44:11.360
How can I maintain my masculinity in a way that pleases you, my lover?

44:13.120 --> 44:14.720
Check out this sexy perm.

44:15.520 --> 44:16.480
I got it permed.

44:16.480 --> 44:18.080
It's like Gabe Kaplan down there.

44:18.080 --> 44:21.120
It looks like I got Gabe Kaplan in a scissor hold.

44:22.720 --> 44:23.600
Oh, Jesus.

44:24.160 --> 44:26.880
You know, having Gabe Kaplan in a scissor hold is how I won the

44:26.880 --> 44:29.040
celebrity poker tournament in 1888.

44:29.600 --> 44:30.160
That's true.

44:32.080 --> 44:33.120
Can I leave?

44:33.120 --> 44:34.400
Can we all leave?

44:34.400 --> 44:36.960
It would be a question that I'd like to ask you.

44:38.160 --> 44:40.160
Let's, let's do one more Yahoo question.

44:40.800 --> 44:46.560
This one, this one was sent in by Liam Dines.

44:46.560 --> 44:47.200
Thank you, Liam.

44:47.200 --> 44:52.720
It's by Yahoo Answers user Timonator, who asks, how would it make you feel

44:52.720 --> 44:57.360
if your partner kept constant unblinking eye contact with you during lovemaking?

44:58.400 --> 45:00.480
He's talking about them f me eyes.

45:00.480 --> 45:03.760
Yeah, he's also talking about a staring contest.

45:04.480 --> 45:05.600
Yeah, sexual stare.

45:05.600 --> 45:08.720
Well, in the animal kingdom, that usually implies a challenge.

45:12.080 --> 45:13.920
I would feel not good, I guess.

45:13.920 --> 45:15.120
I guess I would feel sad.

45:15.120 --> 45:21.360
I guess, I guess I would feel out of place, really put out.

45:22.000 --> 45:25.360
Like if it was a person I cared deeply about and then they dropped that bomb on me,

45:25.360 --> 45:27.920
like I didn't, I don't know how I'd respond to it.

45:27.920 --> 45:31.120
If they were doing, I feel like I would just every couple seconds go,

45:31.920 --> 45:34.320
no, but seriously, is there something I can help you with?

45:34.960 --> 45:35.600
What do you need?

45:36.320 --> 45:38.000
What do you need that I'm not providing for you?

45:38.000 --> 45:39.280
Is there something you'd like to share?

45:39.280 --> 45:41.120
What, what does that look mean?

45:41.840 --> 45:42.480
I'm gonna go.

45:42.480 --> 45:47.200
If there is one place I want a lady to look during lovemaking,

45:47.200 --> 45:50.240
it is above me at the poster of Scott Backlick.

45:50.240 --> 45:56.080
Scott Backlick gave him a big thumbs up, but just says, you're doing it right.

45:56.080 --> 46:01.360
When, I, when Griffin was 13, he finally discovered himself

46:01.360 --> 46:03.520
and turned from an oh boy into an oh man.

46:06.480 --> 46:07.920
It was a really proud day for all of us.

46:07.920 --> 46:12.960
I asked this question on Twitter the other day,

46:12.960 --> 46:16.080
and I don't think anybody took me seriously, but I was watching Quantum Leap

46:16.080 --> 46:19.680
and it was the first episode, I believe in season two,

46:19.680 --> 46:22.720
where he jumps into the body of a woman and I asked,

46:22.720 --> 46:25.200
is it okay to be aroused by that?

46:25.200 --> 46:26.240
For who, Scott Backlick?

46:26.240 --> 46:28.720
I mean, obviously it's okay to be aroused by anything,

46:28.720 --> 46:32.720
but as me, a young heterosexual man,

46:32.720 --> 46:36.240
is it like, it's like Scott Backlick, but a pretty lady.

46:36.240 --> 46:38.160
That's the best of both worlds, isn't it?

46:38.160 --> 46:41.760
Right, because you can hang, you can pilot the Enterprise.

46:42.400 --> 46:43.760
You could talk to Ziggy.

46:43.760 --> 46:45.120
Talk to Ziggy, whatever.

46:45.120 --> 46:46.640
And maybe God?

46:46.640 --> 46:50.480
It's still unclear.

46:50.960 --> 46:54.640
Griffin, does he still look like Scott Backlick?

46:54.640 --> 46:56.960
Is this one of the things where he looks in the mirror and he's the woman?

46:56.960 --> 47:00.480
Here's the thing, you would have to have some sort of mirror apparatus

47:00.480 --> 47:01.520
where that's all you saw.

47:02.480 --> 47:03.120
Wait, wait, wait.

47:03.120 --> 47:04.480
Or maybe it's not, depending on what the flavor is.

47:04.480 --> 47:07.360
Wait, are you saying that you wouldn't be able to do it

47:07.360 --> 47:10.560
unless you could constantly remind yourself visually

47:10.560 --> 47:12.240
that it is in fact Scott Backlick?

47:12.240 --> 47:14.160
There's a lot of questions here, okay?

47:14.160 --> 47:17.600
Let's not just jump to conclusions because, okay,

47:17.600 --> 47:20.160
he's way bigger than the lady that he was in the movie,

47:20.160 --> 47:23.760
yet he's still in the episode, but he's still put on her shoes.

47:25.120 --> 47:27.120
So he must have a lady's body.

47:28.480 --> 47:31.440
Because Al sees him as the lady and he's aroused by it

47:31.440 --> 47:32.720
and he doesn't know how to handle it.

47:32.720 --> 47:35.920
Sort of like the choppy waters I'm navigating right now.

47:35.920 --> 47:37.040
Right.

47:37.040 --> 47:38.160
Because he sees the lady.

47:39.840 --> 47:41.280
I want to point something out, Griffin.

47:41.920 --> 47:43.600
The fact that you're struggling with this

47:43.600 --> 47:46.160
is kind of like the people who still want to kill Screech.

47:47.520 --> 47:50.240
You don't have to be encountering this quandary right now.

47:51.200 --> 47:53.680
I watched this episode yesterday.

47:53.680 --> 47:55.120
Griffin, is it possible?

47:55.120 --> 47:59.920
I feel like this is something you could easily just pretend away,

47:59.920 --> 48:03.040
you know, just have a girl say, hey, I'm really Scott Backlick,

48:03.600 --> 48:04.000
or pray it away.

48:04.000 --> 48:05.440
I think I'm just going to have to,

48:05.440 --> 48:07.280
does anybody have the contact information

48:07.280 --> 48:09.120
for executive producer Donald Bellissari?

48:10.080 --> 48:11.200
Just do what I do.

48:11.200 --> 48:13.840
Go to the set of NCIS and wait to be cast as a corpse.

48:16.000 --> 48:17.920
That's usually how I connect with him.

48:17.920 --> 48:21.200
It's sort of like the bat signal for really untalented people.

48:23.040 --> 48:24.720
Can I just call up Scott Backlick?

48:24.720 --> 48:26.240
I bet he could talk me through this.

48:26.240 --> 48:28.720
I bet he's handled this situation before.

48:28.720 --> 48:35.280
If you've got, oh, you got a bag case of the number 26s, huh?

48:35.280 --> 48:36.080
All right.

48:36.080 --> 48:38.800
Scott, I might be in love with you.

48:38.800 --> 48:39.120
Help.

48:40.240 --> 48:42.240
Does Scott Backlick have his own advice podcast

48:42.800 --> 48:44.000
that we can reach out to?

48:44.000 --> 48:45.680
My Backlick, my Backlick, and me.

48:48.960 --> 48:50.720
I actually worked with him on

48:50.720 --> 48:52.960
It's Not Worth The Prize If You Can't Shut Your Eyes,

48:52.960 --> 48:59.840
a tribute song that the two of us wrote back a long time ago,

48:59.840 --> 49:03.040
so back when everybody discovered that was making you blind.

49:03.040 --> 49:04.560
So I could probably get in touch with him.

49:04.560 --> 49:07.040
I've only got his pager number,

49:07.040 --> 49:09.360
so we'll have to hope that that's fine.

49:09.360 --> 49:13.040
Backlick's having a little trouble moving into the 23th century.

49:13.040 --> 49:15.040
Well, and what's funny is to get his pager to work,

49:15.040 --> 49:18.320
he has to whack it with the palm of his hand every so often.

49:18.320 --> 49:18.560
Yeah.

49:19.280 --> 49:20.720
What if that, you know that's it,

49:20.720 --> 49:23.840
by the way, you know that's his ringtone, you know it 100%.

49:26.320 --> 49:28.960
So this has been our advice podcast

49:28.960 --> 49:34.160
slash Baccala fanfic slash testicular grooming show.

49:35.520 --> 49:38.640
Another point, is it Baccala or Baccala like Dracula?

49:38.640 --> 49:40.240
It's Baccala like Dracula.

49:40.240 --> 49:42.400
Okay, because I say Baccala and that's a point of some kind.

49:42.400 --> 49:44.800
I honestly, Gervin, I think to each his own.

49:44.800 --> 49:45.040
Yeah.

49:45.600 --> 49:47.680
I feel like a Baccala would be cool either way.

49:47.680 --> 49:48.480
Demanded a motto.

49:48.480 --> 49:51.520
Yeah, so thank you so much for listening.

49:52.080 --> 49:54.000
We put out a new show every Monday,

49:55.040 --> 49:58.880

We've got samples on YouTube.

50:14.080 --> 50:15.280
You can search for nbmbam.

50:15.280 --> 50:18.880
I just put a new nbmbam mini called kick boss,

50:18.880 --> 50:20.880
which is about, or ghost boss,

50:20.880 --> 50:22.400
which is about exactly what you'd expect.

50:23.840 --> 50:26.880
Best way to get the inside scoop on those and those go live

50:26.880 --> 50:29.840
is to either join up on our Facebook fan page,

50:29.840 --> 50:32.400
which you can find exactly how you think

50:32.400 --> 50:33.680
or follow us on Twitter.

50:33.680 --> 50:35.280
It's at nbmbam.

50:35.920 --> 50:38.400
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters

50:38.400 --> 50:40.640
for the use of our theme song, It's a Departure,

50:40.640 --> 50:43.440
which plays at the beginning of our show and is incredible.

50:43.440 --> 50:46.080
You can listen to that, Jim, and other Jims like it

50:46.080 --> 50:47.520
on the album Putting the Days to Bed,

50:48.320 --> 50:50.480
which I expect everybody owns at this point,

50:50.480 --> 50:52.480
but if not, get you some.

50:53.200 --> 50:55.680
And I'd like to thank our buddies Chuck and Josh

50:55.680 --> 50:57.680
from the Stuff You Should Know podcast

50:57.680 --> 50:59.360
from howstuffworks.com.

50:59.360 --> 51:01.280
If you've never checked it out, do it now.

51:01.920 --> 51:02.560
It's awesome.

51:03.280 --> 51:04.880
They just did an episode on the moon

51:04.880 --> 51:06.640
not too long ago that I listened to.

51:06.640 --> 51:08.000
So if you'd like to spend a half hour

51:08.000 --> 51:09.200
thinking about Portal 2,

51:10.240 --> 51:12.480
you should go and listen to Stuff You Should Know.

51:12.480 --> 51:16.560
And check out the other shows in the Maximum Fun podcast,

51:16.560 --> 51:18.560
the Jordan, Jesse Goh, Bullseye.

51:20.720 --> 51:22.000
Stop podcasting yourself.

51:22.000 --> 51:24.160
And John Hoffman, yeah.

51:24.160 --> 51:24.800
Get them all.

51:24.800 --> 51:25.760
Collect them all.

51:25.760 --> 51:28.960
Thanks to everybody tweeting about the show this week.

51:30.000 --> 51:36.560
Tom Not Tom, ES Button, Costy Bizzle, Jimmy the Sip,

51:37.440 --> 51:39.440
our dear friend Porter Robinson,

51:39.440 --> 51:42.320
and spreading the word about the program.

51:44.560 --> 51:48.000
Ryan Pequin, Babylonian, everybody.

51:48.000 --> 51:51.600
Jeff Shearer, all of our dear friends

51:51.600 --> 51:53.120
who tweet with the IBM hashtag.

51:53.760 --> 51:55.760
We really, really, really appreciated it.

51:55.760 --> 51:56.720
Thank you all.

51:56.720 --> 51:59.200
We appreciated it and continue to appreciate it.

52:00.080 --> 52:02.160
And may appreciate it in the future.

52:02.160 --> 52:02.880
It's hard to say.

52:02.880 --> 52:09.040
Okay, and keep an eye out for something

52:09.040 --> 52:11.280
that may be coming out this week.

52:13.040 --> 52:13.840
Can we tease it?

52:14.800 --> 52:25.200
I think something of the more musical variety, maybe?

52:25.200 --> 52:28.000
Keep it locked to our Twitter feed and find out.

52:28.960 --> 52:31.120
There will be a little bit of chopping

52:31.120 --> 52:33.360
and a little bit of screwing.

52:33.360 --> 52:35.920
And if you play it at the right time with your lady,

52:35.920 --> 52:37.120
a lot of bit of screwing.

52:38.240 --> 52:39.440
Tot stuff.

52:39.440 --> 52:41.680
And if you're a psychopath murderer,

52:41.680 --> 52:43.280
a lot of chopping too.

52:44.720 --> 52:45.760
But follow us.

52:45.760 --> 52:47.600
And you might want to follow our friend Rocky Horror.

52:47.600 --> 52:48.640
Because I don't know.

52:48.640 --> 52:50.880
Maybe he's a cool guy.

52:50.880 --> 52:53.120
He's a cool guy and there's no other reason.

52:57.280 --> 52:58.480
We haven't mentioned it in a while,

52:58.480 --> 53:02.800
but if you want to subscribe and rate and review on iTunes,

53:02.800 --> 53:04.640
we continue to appreciate that as well.

53:04.640 --> 53:05.200
It's cool too.

53:06.640 --> 53:07.760
And that's everything?

53:08.400 --> 53:10.000
Yeah, I'm going to finish it.

53:10.000 --> 53:10.320
Do it.

53:10.320 --> 53:11.040
I'm going to kill it.

53:11.040 --> 53:14.000
This final Yahoo, it was sent in by Tim.

53:14.000 --> 53:14.560
Thank you, Tim.

53:15.200 --> 53:18.080
It's by Yahoo Answers user GoodTimeCharlie who asks,

53:18.080 --> 53:31.120
How long should I sit on the loo to chase these Tuesday blues away?

53:31.120 --> 53:51.280
How long should I sit on the loo to chase these Tuesday blues away?

53:51.280 --> 53:52.400
I'm Griffin McElroy.

53:52.400 --> 53:54.240
It's been my brother, my brother, and me,

53:54.240 --> 54:03.040
and it's too bad we're on the same team.

54:03.040 --> 54:04.720
Keep your heart, Three Stacks.

54:04.720 --> 54:05.760
Keep your heart.

54:05.760 --> 54:07.920
Hey, keep your heart, Three Stacks.

54:07.920 --> 54:08.960
Keep your heart.

54:08.960 --> 54:10.240
Man, these girls are smart.

54:10.240 --> 54:12.000
Three Stacks, these girls are smart.

54:12.000 --> 54:27.520
Keep your heart, Three Stacks, keep your heart, Three Stacks, keep your heart, Three Stacks.
