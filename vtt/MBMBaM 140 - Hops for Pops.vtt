00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.640 --> 00:49.280
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me, an advice show for the modern era,

00:49.280 --> 00:57.120
and welcome to this very cash exploratory meeting of the Papal Council. Let's not make a big deal

00:57.120 --> 01:05.920
out of it. It's a new era, you know what I mean? It's a Sunday brunch meeting. Put that magic

01:05.920 --> 01:11.840
firewood away that makes the signal smoke come out. It's actually the same dust they used in

01:11.840 --> 01:17.040
Are You Afraid of the Dark. Exactly. Put away your midnight society dust, pick up that mimosa,

01:17.040 --> 01:23.280
and let's just freewheel and chat about it. I'm Justin McElroy. I'm the oldest brother and sort

01:23.280 --> 01:30.880
of the senior member of this advisory council. Is that fair? And I'm Travis McElroy, your middlest

01:30.880 --> 01:35.760
brother, and I just ordered us a round of Virgin Bloody Marys. Oh, that sounds great. I'm the baby

01:35.760 --> 01:44.400
brother, Griffin McElroy, and let's get rolling with this Papal Smear. Yeah, I'm just gonna start.

01:44.400 --> 01:53.920
I feel like we should just throw some names out there, spitball it, and sort of see where we're

01:53.920 --> 02:01.600
at. Okay, let me just kick it off super cash meat. Okay. Let me just get that name out there.

02:01.600 --> 02:07.120
Feel like it's kind of top of mind right now, and we're all sort of dancing around it. I figure,

02:07.120 --> 02:11.680
let me just throw those bones right out there. Yeah, I appreciate. Just cut through the

02:11.680 --> 02:17.280
through the chaff, through the hubbub. I think we can all agree there, Justin, because of the

02:17.280 --> 02:22.080
massive amounts of skeletons in your closet, you are probably not a good choice. Yes,

02:22.080 --> 02:28.080
literally and figuratively. Sorry, boys. I don't understand. What I'm saying is,

02:28.080 --> 02:32.800
if you look at my closet, they're all reading Mad magazines and have licorice wrappers surrounding

02:32.800 --> 02:41.200
them, okay? It's a weird closet. So, man, I'm bummed out already. Justin, I don't think that

02:41.200 --> 02:47.440
you... I don't know that you have what it takes. Justin, advise me. I feel like we're whiteboarding

02:47.440 --> 02:52.640
right now, and I feel like that name is kind of on the whiteboard. Okay. You try to wipe it off,

02:52.640 --> 02:58.400
and it's like, who did this permanent mark on my whiteboard? I'll put it on there when a teacher

02:58.400 --> 03:02.640
gets a really shitty answer from a student in the class, he doesn't want to embarrass him.

03:02.640 --> 03:11.280
He's like, oh, yeah, sure, triangles. Okay, does anybody else have any favorite actors

03:11.280 --> 03:19.120
from the 1930s? I'm going to vote Morgan Freeman. Okay, I like that. I feel like he's in a lot of

03:19.120 --> 03:24.560
stuff. People trust him. He's got that powerful voice. Okay, Travis also bases all of his

03:25.440 --> 03:29.520
religious philosophies around the movie Bruce Almighty and its follow-up sequel.

03:29.520 --> 03:35.840
I'm glad you said that, because my second choice is Jim Carrey. All right. He's not

03:35.840 --> 03:42.240
working so much lately. He probably has some free time, and I think he would make a hilarious

03:42.240 --> 03:51.280
rubber-faced pope. Okay. Is there a chance of a black pope this year? I feel like black pope,

03:51.280 --> 03:58.400
black president... What about checks and balances? Has anybody stopped to think about checks and

03:58.400 --> 04:04.960
balances? Why would there need to be a check or balance against the racial composition?

04:04.960 --> 04:10.400
I'm just saying checks and balances, because the only thing stopping the pope is the president.

04:11.120 --> 04:16.560
Everyone knows that. If we have black pope and black president, I love that I'm in that era.

04:16.560 --> 04:21.760
I'm loving that I'm in that period of history. You do have to wonder, who's looking out for the

04:21.760 --> 04:27.280
white guy? Yeah, because that's what I'm always worried about, is that pretty soon the white man

04:27.280 --> 04:33.200
is going to fall by the wayside. Yeah, what about the white man? Who's looking out for my wants,

04:33.200 --> 04:41.200
my needs? Who's representing my beliefs? We'll have to establish a new Southern Baptist pope,

04:41.920 --> 04:47.840
a new papacy cabinet altogether, but for the Southern Baptist Church, and I think the leader

04:47.840 --> 04:52.960
of that would be Guy Fieri. Can we put any more irony in our voices so that people know that this

04:52.960 --> 04:57.760
is not a real thing that we feel? No, I don't really care who the pope is. Yeah, me neither.

04:57.760 --> 05:02.080
It was exciting when the pope died last time though. I'm kind of sad that we're not going to

05:02.080 --> 05:07.360
get... Remember, I was on Pope Watch because I remember I was waiting for the pope to die,

05:07.360 --> 05:13.840
and I was waiting on Terry Shiloh to die. Oh, no. So I was like, who's going to win?

05:13.840 --> 05:16.880
And then they went at the same time, like at the end of Notebook. Yeah.

05:16.880 --> 05:21.760
I haven't seen that one. Much like Thomas Jefferson and John Adams,

05:21.760 --> 05:25.040
they went within moments of each other cursing the other one's name.

05:25.040 --> 05:33.040
Yeah, which put her right out of the running. So this is our papal, sort of a papal advocacy show,

05:33.040 --> 05:37.120
my brother, my brother, me. Let's get to some other questions, and maybe we can just circle

05:37.120 --> 05:41.440
around back to this question when you guys have any other good suggestions. I kind of feel like

05:41.440 --> 05:47.360
everybody keeps coming back around to me, but we'll have to see if that sticks by the end of the app.

05:47.360 --> 05:50.160
I'm a teacher in training, and in less than a year, I'll be

05:50.720 --> 05:55.920
student teaching in a junior high or high school. Though I'm more than a quarter century old,

05:55.920 --> 05:59.840
I've already been told by various students, friends, bartenders that I look 15.

05:59.840 --> 06:04.000
Now my dentist is telling me that I have to get braces, which will only make things worse.

06:04.560 --> 06:09.360
I need some tips on looking older, so my colleagues won't be asking me for a hall pass

06:09.360 --> 06:13.280
on them all the way to the teacher's lounge, and my students won't be inviting me to come

06:13.280 --> 06:18.560
play Skyrim with them after school. Can you advise? That's from belatedly brace-faced.

06:19.520 --> 06:20.320
Start smoking.

06:21.040 --> 06:22.480
No, okay.

06:22.480 --> 06:24.480
It makes you look cool and old.

06:24.480 --> 06:26.000
That could stunt his growth, though.

06:26.640 --> 06:30.160
Yeah, and nobody looks good when they're smoking and they have braces.

06:30.160 --> 06:30.560
It can't smoke out.

06:30.560 --> 06:31.680
What if you smoke in a pipe?

06:31.680 --> 06:41.280
Can I ask you, so right now, just so I'm clear, it sounds pretty good, though.

06:41.280 --> 06:44.400
Yeah, there's nothing bad about this situation you've just outlined,

06:44.400 --> 06:50.160
because you could be the only human being in the universe to ever live out that thing that happens

06:50.160 --> 06:57.120
in movies where they see the, it's the catch me if you can situation, where the kids pick on the

06:57.120 --> 06:59.600
person they think is a kid, and then they walk to the front of the class and say,

06:59.600 --> 07:05.600
what's up? I'm your teacher, Dr. Youngface. And then they feel so stymied. They feel so embarrassed,

07:05.600 --> 07:07.440
and maybe he gives them a hard time.

07:07.440 --> 07:11.600
You're also got to consider undercover work. That's really important.

07:11.600 --> 07:15.040
See, you went catch me if you can. I went never been kissed.

07:16.720 --> 07:20.560
I've never seen never been kissed, but I assume it's some deep undercover shit.

07:20.560 --> 07:25.600
Yeah. Now, on the negative side, you will not be able to eat Tostitos.

07:25.600 --> 07:30.160
Tostitos, out of the question. Taffy, out of the question. I'm surprised that this is the first

07:30.160 --> 07:35.440
braces related question that we've gotten, because I feel like I could really bust out some,

07:35.440 --> 07:40.080
I lost so many brackets. I ate one once, because I got enthusiastic about some Taffy.

07:41.120 --> 07:48.400
I broke a tooth last weekend. I was eating a protein bar, believe it was from Kashi.

07:48.400 --> 07:51.520
I was eating it, and I literally had this thought,

07:51.520 --> 07:57.040
I literally had this thought, what is in this? It tastes like teeth.

07:57.040 --> 08:02.560
Yeah. And then it turned out that it was, in fact, I was eating my teeth, my tooth.

08:02.560 --> 08:05.440
So instead of braces, you should get yourself dentures.

08:05.440 --> 08:08.400
Why do you have to get braces? Nobody has to get braces.

08:08.400 --> 08:12.560
I had to. It was literally life. My teeth were growing into my fucking brain.

08:12.560 --> 08:15.520
It was life threatening in my case. I did have to get braces.

08:15.520 --> 08:22.160
My grill does not come correct, and I don't really care. I'm living with it.

08:22.160 --> 08:25.600
But your grill doesn't look like a fucking sarlacc pit,

08:25.600 --> 08:28.560
which is basically what I was working with in middle school.

08:28.560 --> 08:33.680
I'm saying some people need it. I'm saying it's going to be rough for you vis-a-vis Skittles,

08:33.680 --> 08:38.080
but I am saying that I think this 21 Jump Street opportunity,

08:38.080 --> 08:40.320
if you let it slide by, you're going to regret it for the rest of your life.

08:41.440 --> 08:45.360
I'll also say this, because I have lots of friends that look much younger than they are,

08:45.360 --> 08:51.280
and right now that sucks, but when you're 60 and you look like you're 42,

08:52.000 --> 08:53.200
it's going to be a blessing.

08:54.880 --> 08:57.760
Because then you'll be able to hook up with all the 42 year olds you want.

09:00.160 --> 09:04.160
Any other advantages to being one of the students?

09:04.160 --> 09:07.680
You could blow off class sometimes, by which I mean don't teach it,

09:07.680 --> 09:10.560
just sit in a chair and wait for the real teacher to show up,

09:10.560 --> 09:13.920
and then halfway through, oh my god, okay, okay.

09:13.920 --> 09:19.280
So first day of class, you go in, you grab a chair, you don't address,

09:19.280 --> 09:24.000
and then you're like, after a couple minutes, where is this teacher going, man?

09:24.000 --> 09:30.240
It's like he had this whole class planned, and we had 50 minutes,

09:30.240 --> 09:34.320
and we've already waited eight minutes, so even if he showed up now,

09:34.320 --> 09:37.680
and one of the other students would be like, yeah, 42 minutes left,

09:37.680 --> 09:45.120
and then you stand up and you're like, that's your first lesson.

09:45.120 --> 09:47.120
Welcome to high school subtraction.

09:47.120 --> 09:54.880
Welcome to high school subtraction 101 with me, Professor Youngface.

09:54.880 --> 09:56.880
You are all clearly remedial.

10:00.160 --> 10:02.320
Welcome to remedial subtraction.

10:02.320 --> 10:07.360
Listen, I got addition, damn, no problem.

10:07.360 --> 10:10.320
Subtraction though, it's like, where are they going?

10:11.120 --> 10:14.960
And that's when you have like a captain by captain moment,

10:14.960 --> 10:17.920
and say like, just add negative numbers, and they're like,

10:18.480 --> 10:22.000
I understand subtraction, and then they can become cashier.

10:23.840 --> 10:27.280
Oh man, do you think that new teachers, whenever like a new teacher

10:27.280 --> 10:29.440
starts like their first day at his school,

10:29.440 --> 10:32.880
they try to like break the world record for desk standing students?

10:32.880 --> 10:34.960
Like, I bet I can do this shit.

10:34.960 --> 10:37.200
I bet I can do this shit by third period.

10:37.200 --> 10:39.840
These kids are gonna be on their desks swearing blood oaths to me.

10:41.280 --> 10:44.240
They probably keep a pretty close eye on that sort of thing

10:44.240 --> 10:45.520
in the administration now.

10:45.520 --> 10:47.520
Do you think that after that movie came out though,

10:47.520 --> 10:51.520
that they had to start like purchasing desks based on their standability?

10:51.520 --> 10:55.360
Because you don't want to have like shoddy, like unbalanced desks,

10:55.360 --> 10:56.640
and it's like, oh, okay.

10:56.640 --> 11:00.080
Oh fuck, Captain Mike, fuck.

11:00.080 --> 11:02.960
I mean, he's just holding on to the ceiling fan spinning around.

11:03.520 --> 11:07.440
That scene ended with one of the kids standing on his desk,

11:07.440 --> 11:09.680
and the desk just falling to splinters.

11:09.680 --> 11:11.680
It would be the best scene ever.

11:12.320 --> 11:13.520
Oh, Captain, whoa.

11:13.520 --> 11:15.840
I always thought, cuss of the janitor going,

11:15.840 --> 11:18.720
I was going to tighten the seats tomorrow, damn it.

11:18.720 --> 11:21.040
I always thought that movie, it's a great movie,

11:21.040 --> 11:23.120
but it desperately needed more nut shots.

11:23.120 --> 11:24.400
It's got Robin Williams in it.

11:24.400 --> 11:27.680
I expect a certain level of nut shots from a Robin Williams film.

11:27.680 --> 11:29.440
As one of the students like started to fall,

11:29.440 --> 11:31.600
he grabbed the guy next to him and grabbed the guy next to him.

11:31.600 --> 11:33.840
Pretty soon it just like dominoed around the room

11:33.840 --> 11:36.080
until they were all in one big nut shot pile.

11:36.080 --> 11:38.560
As Robin Williams just smacked his forehead and said,

11:38.560 --> 11:39.760
let's get back to subtraction.

11:39.760 --> 11:44.960
Patch Adams fucking ruined me for several reasons,

11:44.960 --> 11:46.320
but it ruined my Robin Williams.

11:46.320 --> 11:47.520
So did the movie.

11:47.520 --> 11:49.600
It ruined my Robin Williams expectation gains,

11:49.600 --> 11:51.200
because then you would have to go back to the movie

11:51.200 --> 11:53.600
Robin Williams expectation gains, because then you watch that,

11:54.240 --> 11:56.480
you watch that, what dreams may come.

11:56.480 --> 11:59.120
And it's like, I don't understand why these people aren't being,

11:59.120 --> 12:01.120
you know, hitting the balls with a giant clown shoe.

12:02.960 --> 12:04.960
I think that this person needs to also understand

12:04.960 --> 12:08.800
that they have the possibility of being the student teacher

12:08.800 --> 12:10.480
that somebody has a crush on in high school.

12:11.440 --> 12:13.280
And I'm not saying that's something that you need to pursue,

12:13.280 --> 12:15.600
but that's a very formative experience for them.

12:15.600 --> 12:17.760
Some would say the most formative experience.

12:17.760 --> 12:19.920
And I think that you could be that for somebody.

12:19.920 --> 12:21.440
To serve with love.

12:21.440 --> 12:22.240
Mm-hmm.

12:22.240 --> 12:24.400
Griffin, do you have a question for us?

12:24.400 --> 12:24.640
Sure.

12:24.640 --> 12:26.000
From the Yahoo Answers service.

12:26.000 --> 12:29.360
I have one pruned from the Yahoo Answers service

12:30.080 --> 12:35.120
by Nick Robinson, curator, curer of this.

12:36.000 --> 12:36.480
Thank you, Nick.

12:36.480 --> 12:38.960
It's by Yahoo Answers user Rob, who asks,

12:38.960 --> 12:41.520
how do I find out if Subway is paying my girlfriend

12:41.520 --> 12:43.200
to advertise their products to me?

12:45.040 --> 12:47.280
I think Subway might secretly be paying my girlfriend

12:47.280 --> 12:48.720
to advertise their products to me

12:48.720 --> 12:50.480
to try to get me to become a customer.

12:50.480 --> 12:53.040
I need to find out if this is happening or how to stop it.

12:53.920 --> 12:57.520
This is that new wave advertising I've been hearing about.

12:57.520 --> 13:00.160
This is like, what's the level below gorilla?

13:00.160 --> 13:01.040
That's what this is.

13:01.680 --> 13:02.560
This is rough.

13:02.560 --> 13:03.600
This is rough stuff.

13:03.600 --> 13:04.880
It's rough on a few levels.

13:04.880 --> 13:06.800
One, because this person obviously has some sort of...

13:07.920 --> 13:08.400
Sure.

13:08.400 --> 13:08.720
Ish.

13:09.360 --> 13:09.680
But also-

13:09.680 --> 13:10.640
Can't deal with that, though.

13:10.640 --> 13:11.680
Well, okay.

13:11.680 --> 13:13.200
You can't assume that, Griffin.

13:13.840 --> 13:15.760
I can pretty say, I mean, the evidence,

13:15.760 --> 13:19.200
it's, I guess it's all circumstantial, but-

13:19.200 --> 13:21.680
They pay Jared to advertise.

13:21.680 --> 13:23.280
Why wouldn't they pay his girlfriend?

13:23.280 --> 13:24.800
Are you dating Jared?

13:24.800 --> 13:28.560
They pay Michael Phelps to wave his giant arms and advertise it.

13:28.560 --> 13:31.520
Why wouldn't they pay his girlfriend, Michael Phelps?

13:37.120 --> 13:41.520
What is this woman doing that has turned Rob's suspicion

13:42.240 --> 13:44.720
to high alert, is what I want to know.

13:44.720 --> 13:46.720
What are those convos like?

13:47.840 --> 13:49.520
Because if it's just like, they're driving down the street,

13:49.520 --> 13:50.800
she's like, what should we get for lunch?

13:50.800 --> 13:52.320
I vote for Subway.

13:52.320 --> 13:53.360
And she does that every day.

13:53.360 --> 13:55.440
Maybe she just really, really likes Subway

13:55.440 --> 14:00.240
and their large selection of cheap, large, and delicious sandwiches.

14:00.240 --> 14:03.680
Or maybe it's like when he gets into a fight with his parents

14:03.680 --> 14:05.440
and he's just like, I never get my own way.

14:05.440 --> 14:08.160
And she says, do you know where you can have everything your own way?

14:08.160 --> 14:09.280
At Subway.

14:09.280 --> 14:11.440
They'll make sandwiches just for you, John.

14:11.440 --> 14:14.640
$5 footlongs, hashtag February.

14:14.640 --> 14:16.560
Did you just fucking say hashtag?

14:18.800 --> 14:20.400
Are you a sandwich robot?

14:20.400 --> 14:21.680
I certainly am not.

14:21.680 --> 14:24.000
But let me tell you more about the delicious toppings.

14:26.240 --> 14:27.920
Robots couldn't make sandwiches

14:27.920 --> 14:30.480
like the Subway artists at Subway make sandwiches.

14:30.480 --> 14:32.960
It takes an artist's touch and finesse

14:32.960 --> 14:34.560
to put together a sandwich like this.

14:34.560 --> 14:36.240
And $5 for 12 inches?

14:36.240 --> 14:38.400
Can't beat that, hashtag Jared value.

14:38.400 --> 14:41.040
Listen, honey, I understand that Subway's great.

14:41.040 --> 14:42.800
Could you wait till we're done having sex

14:42.800 --> 14:44.800
to tell me about their sandwiches, please?

14:44.800 --> 14:46.800
I love the way you're having sex with me.

14:48.160 --> 14:51.040
It reminds me of speaking of footlongs.

14:54.560 --> 14:55.760
I love the way you're having sex with me.

14:55.760 --> 14:59.760
If you want to feel satisfied, check out the latest deals at Subway.

14:59.760 --> 15:02.800
$5 for a footlong, you won't leave empty either.

15:02.800 --> 15:04.640
Speaking of double meat, let's...

15:06.000 --> 15:07.200
Sorry about your sister.

15:07.200 --> 15:08.480
Sorry about your sister.

15:08.480 --> 15:10.640
Hey, what's your favorite bread type?

15:10.640 --> 15:12.880
Mine's Parmesan rosemary Italian.

15:13.920 --> 15:16.000
This is the worst eulogy I've ever heard.

15:16.800 --> 15:20.880
I maybe just start asking how she likes certain sandwich components.

15:20.880 --> 15:23.200
Like do you just keep taking her to Quiznos?

15:24.880 --> 15:26.480
See if smoke pours out of her ears.

15:27.040 --> 15:29.280
Do you like, how do you, do you like bacon?

15:29.280 --> 15:31.520
Yeah, but I don't like it crispy.

15:31.520 --> 15:34.880
I like it kind of floppy and stacked on a bunch of other bacon.

15:34.880 --> 15:37.040
I read a report in Le Mans.

15:37.040 --> 15:40.240
That said that bacon is way better when it's floppy and gross

15:40.240 --> 15:43.680
and it's been touched by several people before you eat it.

15:44.560 --> 15:46.960
Do you like your meat to be like pre-portioned

15:46.960 --> 15:49.120
into those little cardboard bowls?

15:49.120 --> 15:50.240
Yes, please.

15:50.240 --> 15:53.280
When you make her chicken for dinner, does she turn her nose about and say,

15:53.280 --> 15:54.160
when did you cook this?

15:54.800 --> 15:55.440
Just now?

15:56.000 --> 15:57.360
What am I supposed to do with this?

15:59.360 --> 16:02.240
Two wax paper sheets and then kind of smack it onto the bed.

16:02.240 --> 16:03.760
Like it's been misbehaving.

16:03.760 --> 16:04.640
Thank you.

16:04.640 --> 16:05.600
This is great pizza,

16:05.600 --> 16:07.760
but could you put another slice of pizza on top of it

16:07.760 --> 16:10.480
and then just dunk it in water to make it really wet?

16:10.480 --> 16:10.880
Thank you.

16:12.400 --> 16:14.320
I have not had so many pizzas out it's like.

16:15.280 --> 16:17.200
I would like some oil and vinegar on my salad,

16:17.200 --> 16:19.920
but could you look at me disdainfully when I ask for it, please?

16:19.920 --> 16:20.560
Thank you.

16:20.560 --> 16:21.760
Maybe, but maybe it's deep.

16:21.760 --> 16:22.480
Maybe it goes deeper.

16:22.480 --> 16:24.320
Maybe she's getting paychecks.

16:24.320 --> 16:28.000
Maybe she has a source of income that he does not understand.

16:28.000 --> 16:31.520
Maybe it's an inscrutable Subway advertising paycheck.

16:31.520 --> 16:32.880
Maybe she's on the street team.

16:33.840 --> 16:34.320
Maybe she disappears.

16:34.320 --> 16:35.760
Now street team I believe.

16:35.760 --> 16:36.000
Yeah.

16:36.560 --> 16:37.680
Street team I'd buy.

16:37.680 --> 16:40.720
I also want to say, listen, believe me, in this world,

16:40.720 --> 16:44.160
you would be amazed at the different job opportunities that exist.

16:44.160 --> 16:45.760
Do you know that when you listen to the radio

16:45.760 --> 16:48.480
and people call in to like answer their crazy questions

16:48.480 --> 16:50.240
about the fight they had with their boyfriend

16:50.240 --> 16:52.880
or the time that they caught their sister doing something,

16:52.880 --> 16:55.600
those are all like paid people to do that.

16:55.600 --> 16:56.480
That's not real.

16:56.480 --> 16:57.760
That's not true, Travis.

16:57.760 --> 16:58.560
It is true.

16:58.560 --> 17:00.960
My friend Kelly was paid to be one of those people.

17:01.920 --> 17:02.720
That's a real thing.

17:02.720 --> 17:05.440
Not every time, but sometimes just to kind of get the ball rolling

17:05.440 --> 17:07.040
and to get people to start answering.

17:07.040 --> 17:12.240
You only have to make one friend on Twitter

17:12.240 --> 17:15.760
that turns out to be a robot designed to sell you Subway sandwiches

17:16.720 --> 17:22.320
to then have that veil of suspicion built between you and your every loved one.

17:23.280 --> 17:23.840
Yes.

17:23.840 --> 17:28.640
So what I'm saying is maybe, maybe, maybe there is a company,

17:28.640 --> 17:30.400
not necessarily Subway specific.

17:30.400 --> 17:32.720
We kind of, they cover a bunch of different organizations,

17:32.720 --> 17:34.240
a bunch of different businesses,

17:34.240 --> 17:38.080
and they hire actors and actresses to pose as people's loved ones

17:38.880 --> 17:42.080
to try to convince them to use the products from that location.

17:42.080 --> 17:43.120
It's not crazy.

17:43.120 --> 17:44.080
It could happen.

17:44.080 --> 17:46.240
I'm just saying that that's not crazy.

17:46.240 --> 17:49.280
I want to be there when this campaign, when the Subway campaign ends

17:49.280 --> 17:51.200
because marketing dollars are finite.

17:51.200 --> 17:53.120
You'll have to get them one day when you say,

17:53.920 --> 17:54.720
so where do you want to go?

17:56.000 --> 17:56.880
Subway?

17:56.880 --> 17:57.520
What?

17:57.520 --> 18:00.000
No, actually, fuck Subway.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
I want to go to Texas Steakhouse.

18:02.000 --> 18:05.280
I mean, but what if she is on the longest con with this gentleman?

18:05.280 --> 18:09.600
This Subway shuts down and she's like, listen, Mark, I had a great time,

18:09.600 --> 18:11.840
but we've come to the end of our-

18:11.840 --> 18:13.040
Just ended a divorce.

18:13.040 --> 18:13.360
Yeah.

18:13.360 --> 18:15.120
It's, listen, you were great.

18:15.120 --> 18:17.280
You were a great consumer.

18:17.280 --> 18:20.720
Lots of, like a surprising amount of millions of dollars

18:20.720 --> 18:22.640
you were giving to Subway every year.

18:22.640 --> 18:25.760
You've also lost a ton of weight just eating Subway every day.

18:25.760 --> 18:30.160
In a weird sort of way, I almost sort of developed feelings for you,

18:30.160 --> 18:32.480
but not a lot of feelings.

18:32.480 --> 18:32.800
And I do want to contact-

18:32.800 --> 18:34.960
We shared a lot of topping preferences.

18:34.960 --> 18:36.560
We liked the same kind of bread.

18:36.560 --> 18:39.280
Let's just, why don't we start over, you know?

18:39.280 --> 18:41.680
Why don't we go get, oh, no, okay, no.

18:42.480 --> 18:43.760
Let's go to Penn Station.

18:43.760 --> 18:44.160
Let's go to Penn Station.

18:44.160 --> 18:45.680
No, maybe that'll be our new thing.

18:45.680 --> 18:47.440
Come on, I'll get you a Pibb extra.

18:47.440 --> 18:50.160
My friend and I just finished our first adventure in home brewing.

18:50.960 --> 18:53.680
The beer turned out great, but here's a problem.

18:53.680 --> 18:56.080
We don't have any idea what to call it.

18:56.080 --> 18:59.040
We could really use some of that McElroy wisdom

18:59.040 --> 19:00.960
to pick out a great name for our brew.

19:01.680 --> 19:05.360
The beer is an Irish stout with notes of dark chocolate.

19:05.360 --> 19:09.440
If it helps, we could send you a few bottles to try it out.

19:09.440 --> 19:12.560
This is from Brew Wilder in Treetown.

19:13.680 --> 19:15.440
Travis, did you just put this question in here

19:15.440 --> 19:17.360
so that we can maybe get some free beers?

19:17.360 --> 19:21.120
Did you think they would just send free beers to PO Box 54,

19:21.120 --> 19:23.760
honey, to West Virginia, 25706?

19:23.760 --> 19:24.260
Perhaps.

19:25.200 --> 19:27.440
I also want to point out to Brew Wilder

19:27.440 --> 19:30.080
that it is easier for us to name the beer

19:30.080 --> 19:31.520
if you send the beer first.

19:32.080 --> 19:34.720
It's a lot harder for us to name it

19:34.720 --> 19:37.520
and then be held by you sending it to us afterwards.

19:37.520 --> 19:41.040
I just came up with a name for the beer

19:41.040 --> 19:42.960
that Travis tried to make that one time

19:42.960 --> 19:44.960
when we lived together in Batavia, Ohio,

19:45.840 --> 19:48.000
which was bottled in plastic bottles,

19:48.000 --> 19:50.480
and then I had two sips of,

19:50.480 --> 19:53.360
and the name of that beer is bubbly soy sauce

19:53.360 --> 19:54.480
because that's what it was.

19:56.640 --> 19:58.080
I might have no idea what I did wrong,

19:58.080 --> 19:59.760
but it did not turn out well.

19:59.760 --> 20:01.760
What we did wrong was that we used tap water

20:01.760 --> 20:03.520
and we did it in a crock pot

20:03.520 --> 20:06.080
that I used to make ramen earlier that day,

20:06.080 --> 20:08.640
and then we put it in plastic bottles

20:08.640 --> 20:10.720
in our refrigerator for about four days.

20:11.360 --> 20:14.160
So what we did, there were a few steps there

20:14.160 --> 20:15.600
where we goofed and slipped,

20:15.600 --> 20:17.760
maybe a little, maybe a tad.

20:17.760 --> 20:19.520
Man, that was fucking grody.

20:19.520 --> 20:20.560
Man, that was the worst.

20:20.560 --> 20:21.280
It was grody.

20:21.280 --> 20:22.560
It's the first beer I've ever had

20:22.560 --> 20:24.240
that I could not give away.

20:24.240 --> 20:26.720
I took it to like three different parties

20:26.720 --> 20:27.520
and I was like,

20:27.520 --> 20:28.960
and I brought this beer if anyone wants it,

20:28.960 --> 20:30.960
and they took a look at the unlabeled

20:30.960 --> 20:33.760
brown plastic bottles with the white screw on caps

20:33.760 --> 20:35.760
that looked like I just dumped out some mug root beer

20:35.760 --> 20:37.520
and refilled it, and they were like,

20:37.520 --> 20:38.320
nah, we're good.

20:38.320 --> 20:39.840
Couldn't give it away.

20:39.840 --> 20:40.800
Not crazy about that.

20:40.800 --> 20:42.560
I will dip my sushi in it though,

20:42.560 --> 20:45.040
because that seems just perfect.

20:45.040 --> 20:47.840
Because that seems just perfect.

20:47.840 --> 20:52.080
This is a, why do you need a name?

20:52.080 --> 20:53.840
You know, why do you need branding?

20:53.840 --> 20:55.280
It's just beer.

20:55.280 --> 20:56.880
You just drink it.

20:56.880 --> 20:59.040
You could make it to market to TV shows

20:59.040 --> 21:00.800
that don't want to worry about branding issues

21:00.800 --> 21:02.320
and just call it beer.

21:02.320 --> 21:03.760
Just call it beer.

21:03.760 --> 21:05.040
I see what you're saying.

21:05.040 --> 21:05.920
I see what you're saying.

21:05.920 --> 21:07.840
So like on the real world,

21:07.840 --> 21:10.320
they cover up the labels with duct tape.

21:10.320 --> 21:11.840
With this, you could just say

21:11.840 --> 21:13.440
a bottle of refreshing liquid.

21:13.440 --> 21:14.400
You could even be...

21:14.400 --> 21:15.040
Yes.

21:15.040 --> 21:15.280
Yeah.

21:15.840 --> 21:17.760
Do you think the person who has to cover up

21:17.760 --> 21:20.160
the beer labels with duct tape on the real world

21:20.160 --> 21:21.680
describes themselves as being

21:21.680 --> 21:23.120
in the entertainment industry?

21:23.120 --> 21:24.240
Oh God, yes.

21:25.120 --> 21:25.520
I'm like-

21:25.520 --> 21:28.640
He works marketing in the entertainment.

21:28.640 --> 21:30.960
He's the same guy that duct tapes over the emblems

21:30.960 --> 21:33.600
on people's hats on MTV Cribs.

21:33.600 --> 21:34.480
Hold on there.

21:34.480 --> 21:35.120
Okay.

21:35.120 --> 21:36.880
Hold on there, Buckaroo.

21:36.880 --> 21:38.320
Let me just get that shampoo.

21:38.880 --> 21:39.520
Gotcha.

21:39.520 --> 21:39.840
Gotcha.

21:39.840 --> 21:41.120
Okay, duct taped.

21:41.120 --> 21:41.360
Yeah, I'm in-

21:41.360 --> 21:43.440
I will be in my trailer full of tape.

21:43.440 --> 21:45.760
I am in reverse marketing is what I'm into.

21:47.680 --> 21:49.360
I stunt brands is what I do.

21:50.000 --> 21:51.920
Two years ago, I was dating a girl

21:51.920 --> 21:54.160
that turned out to be paid by Subway

21:54.160 --> 21:56.000
and after having my heart broken,

21:56.000 --> 21:57.680
I swore it off all brand day.

21:58.640 --> 22:00.880
It seems a strange crusade, I know.

22:01.760 --> 22:03.280
I do have a long-term plan

22:03.280 --> 22:05.840
to murder Jared Fogle in three months.

22:05.840 --> 22:07.840
So I do have that going for me.

22:07.840 --> 22:08.720
That's sort of my whole...

22:08.720 --> 22:13.360
Sort of pretty much my whole motif right now.

22:13.360 --> 22:14.080
Do you think Jared...

22:14.720 --> 22:16.480
Do you think when she broke up with him,

22:16.480 --> 22:18.000
Jared was like waving outside?

22:19.280 --> 22:19.840
Come on, babe.

22:19.840 --> 22:20.560
In his Subway Jeep?

22:21.680 --> 22:24.720
No, it's on a Subway motorcycle, obviously.

22:24.720 --> 22:25.280
Come on, babe.

22:25.280 --> 22:25.600
Obviously.

22:26.320 --> 22:29.040
With his stupid Garden State sidecar.

22:29.040 --> 22:31.760
He's wearing a helmet made of day-old bread.

22:35.200 --> 22:36.320
Great, now I'm hungry.

22:36.320 --> 22:36.640
Yeah.

22:36.640 --> 22:37.520
I know.

22:37.520 --> 22:38.880
So, names for beer.

22:38.880 --> 22:39.600
Names for beer.

22:40.880 --> 22:42.480
I think you need to do anything

22:42.480 --> 22:46.800
where you take like the word brew or suds or anything

22:46.800 --> 22:50.080
and place it into the title of something else that you enjoy.

22:50.080 --> 22:50.800
What about this?

22:50.800 --> 22:51.520
Slam drunk.

22:52.240 --> 22:53.360
Ooh, I like it.

22:54.000 --> 22:54.880
How's that?

22:54.880 --> 22:55.920
That's kind of sporty.

22:55.920 --> 22:58.720
What about suds buds?

22:58.720 --> 22:59.680
Bud suds.

23:01.200 --> 23:03.840
So suds buds is obviously the name of your company

23:03.840 --> 23:06.080
and then bud suds because it's beer

23:06.080 --> 23:07.840
and maybe you sprinkle a little bit of weed in it.

23:09.200 --> 23:10.800
A lot of people have been trying to find a way

23:10.800 --> 23:14.240
to corner this new booming legal marijuana market.

23:14.240 --> 23:17.440
I think sprinkle some flakes of your beer into the weed

23:17.440 --> 23:19.440
and then that can be your whole thing.

23:19.440 --> 23:22.240
Yeah, it's weird.

23:22.960 --> 23:25.440
What about rehydrated beer

23:25.440 --> 23:28.080
and you tell people that it came in a powder form

23:28.080 --> 23:29.520
and then you rehydrate it?

23:29.520 --> 23:32.000
Because that seems convenient and kind of futuristic.

23:32.000 --> 23:36.560
What about pre-popsicles?

23:38.000 --> 23:39.680
Couldn't that be any fluid though?

23:40.960 --> 23:42.320
Not beer, it doesn't freeze.

23:43.360 --> 23:43.680
Got it.

23:43.680 --> 23:51.520
What about suds buds?

23:51.520 --> 23:52.160
Dad fuel.

23:53.920 --> 23:55.920
Dad fuel is a great name for a beer.

23:55.920 --> 23:56.420
Epic.

23:57.680 --> 23:58.640
Dad fuel.

23:58.640 --> 24:03.440
Dad fuel.

24:03.440 --> 24:05.200
When my daddy comes home from work

24:06.000 --> 24:07.760
and he's running on fumes.

24:12.080 --> 24:14.080
He gases up with some dad fuel

24:14.080 --> 24:15.680
and then he's ready to hang out with us.

24:16.960 --> 24:19.840
You'll be ready to dad for two to three hours

24:19.840 --> 24:22.240
after just one dad fuel.

24:22.240 --> 24:25.760
Pop it open, rip it off, bounce them on your knees.

24:25.760 --> 24:29.280
Now consult your physician before you try dad fuel

24:29.280 --> 24:32.240
and if your dadergy lasts longer than four hours.

24:32.240 --> 24:34.160
Yeah, just keep popping more dad fuel.

24:34.160 --> 24:35.680
My fucking kids went to bed

24:35.680 --> 24:37.840
and I really want to play with them more.

24:37.840 --> 24:40.160
This is damn it, all this dad fuel.

24:40.160 --> 24:43.040
We are skipping school tomorrow and doing it.

24:43.040 --> 24:43.760
Dad fuel.

24:47.920 --> 24:49.840
I'm in dad fuel rehab right now.

24:49.840 --> 24:51.680
I need you kids to keep your distance.

24:52.960 --> 24:55.440
I've been ordered not to play with my children

24:55.440 --> 24:57.120
for 50 days.

24:57.120 --> 24:59.200
Please respect, please respect this.

24:59.200 --> 25:00.000
Please.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.360
Please respect this journey.

25:01.360 --> 25:04.400
Dad accidentally put some unleaded dad fuel in the system

25:04.400 --> 25:07.120
so dad's gonna need to sleep in a little bit today.

25:07.760 --> 25:09.680
Can you guys get yourselves to school?

25:09.680 --> 25:10.160
Thanks.

25:11.920 --> 25:14.560
Let's fucking top off our dad fuel tanks

25:14.560 --> 25:26.960
and drive on down to the money zone.

25:26.960 --> 25:29.200
Hey Trav, who's this first message for?

25:29.760 --> 25:31.520
It's for Ian Mullian.

25:31.520 --> 25:32.320
Or Mullin.

25:33.520 --> 25:34.560
Or Dovrum.

25:35.920 --> 25:37.680
If he is French, it is Moulin.

25:38.320 --> 25:40.480
If he is Chinese, it is Mulan.

25:41.360 --> 25:43.040
It's from his younger brother.

25:43.040 --> 25:45.360
It does not appear to be named here.

25:45.360 --> 25:47.200
It's secret Moulin.

25:47.200 --> 25:49.520
Secret Moulin, his younger brother.

25:49.520 --> 25:58.400
Happy birthday, Ian, on February 8th from your favorite brother.

25:58.400 --> 25:59.920
Thank you for always being awesome

25:59.920 --> 26:04.000
and introducing me to Mim Bam, Mamba if you prefer.

26:05.120 --> 26:08.160
I was hoping the bros could wish you a happy birthday.

26:08.160 --> 26:09.920
Be fitting of a king.

26:09.920 --> 26:12.800
Happy birthday, Moulin.

26:12.800 --> 26:16.800
Oh my gosh, Lindsay.

26:16.800 --> 26:17.680
Excuse me?

26:17.680 --> 26:18.560
What did he say?

26:18.560 --> 26:19.280
Sorry?

26:19.280 --> 26:21.760
So happy birthday, King Ian.

26:22.480 --> 26:24.160
Do you wanna have sex?

26:24.960 --> 26:25.920
I'm your sister.

26:25.920 --> 26:26.880
This is Game of Thrones.

26:28.160 --> 26:29.120
Okay, cool, thank you.

26:29.840 --> 26:33.280
All right, winter's coming and so is your next birthday.

26:33.280 --> 26:34.400
So catch it.

26:34.960 --> 26:36.160
Trav, we got another message.

26:36.160 --> 26:38.080
Is this the one for Lindsay Peters?

26:38.080 --> 26:40.080
It is the one for Lindsay Peters.

26:42.960 --> 26:43.920
Oh, I'm sorry.

26:43.920 --> 26:46.000
Do you have some other context for me?

26:46.000 --> 26:47.280
I do have more information.

26:47.280 --> 26:48.000
Would you like it?

26:48.640 --> 26:50.240
Yeah, you know, as much as I was

26:50.240 --> 26:52.560
just wanting to like read these words back and forth,

26:52.560 --> 26:54.960
I thought maybe we could try to make like a conversation.

26:55.600 --> 26:59.760
Well, this message is from Daniel, Liz, Logan, and Ryan.

26:59.760 --> 27:01.680
And it says here both day and night,

27:01.680 --> 27:03.840
which either means they know two Ryans,

27:03.840 --> 27:06.320
one named Ryan Day and one named Ryan Night,

27:06.320 --> 27:09.280
which is cool where there's one Ryan

27:09.280 --> 27:13.040
and he behaves differently during the day and during the night.

27:13.040 --> 27:16.320
Or there's like Lady Hawk, there's a Ryan

27:16.880 --> 27:19.600
where every day at dusk he goes home

27:19.600 --> 27:22.000
and then the next Ryan comes in for his shift.

27:24.080 --> 27:25.680
I don't know what that-

27:25.680 --> 27:25.920
Guys-

27:25.920 --> 27:27.920
There's literally no explanation.

27:27.920 --> 27:29.920
It's not the craziest thing.

27:29.920 --> 27:31.520
How are you guys celebrating Ryan Day?

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
I'm just looking forward to, you know me.

27:36.000 --> 27:37.600
I'm just looking forward to Ryan Night, man.

27:37.600 --> 27:40.240
Living for the Ryan Night.

27:40.240 --> 27:41.760
Anyway, we should make this message

27:41.760 --> 27:43.920
about the person who the message is for.

27:43.920 --> 27:44.720
Yeah, okay.

27:44.720 --> 27:48.320
So Lindsay, congratulations on your new gig.

27:48.320 --> 27:54.160
All your misandrist friends here at MLMRMDAM

27:54.160 --> 27:55.600
are really proud.

27:55.600 --> 27:57.440
She'll be making an honest living

27:57.440 --> 28:00.320
so she can fund her hedgehog and Greyhound habits.

28:00.320 --> 28:03.280
You know, I hate delivering these coded messages.

28:03.280 --> 28:06.000
Does she really have hedgehogs?

28:06.000 --> 28:07.040
I don't, is that an in-joke?

28:07.040 --> 28:08.240
Did you just say the activation-

28:08.240 --> 28:09.600
Or is it like a sex thing?

28:09.600 --> 28:11.280
Did you just say the activation phrase

28:11.280 --> 28:14.320
that's gonna send her after our American president and Pope?

28:16.160 --> 28:19.600
I was trying to decode what MLMRMDAM means

28:19.600 --> 28:23.200
and I think it is my lover, my roommate, my dad and me

28:23.840 --> 28:26.800
which makes me all kinds of uncomfortable.

28:26.800 --> 28:30.400
So have a happy, uncomfortable new job, Lindsay Peters.

28:30.400 --> 28:32.240
Do you think that that's an activation phrase

28:32.240 --> 28:35.280
that turns it from a robot into an android

28:35.280 --> 28:36.320
that's capable of love?

28:37.440 --> 28:38.720
That's exactly what just happened.

28:40.000 --> 28:43.040
Got one more thing we want to tell you about.

28:43.040 --> 28:46.000
Super exciting, not a person, more of an entity.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.640
You want to go to, it's a show called

28:48.640 --> 28:51.120
The Chapter Titles Were So Good.

28:51.120 --> 28:52.720
It's a weekly podcast discussing

28:52.720 --> 28:55.360
the magical world of Harry Potter one chapter at a time.

28:56.240 --> 28:59.040
They balance keen literary insight

28:59.040 --> 29:01.040
with a reverent off-the-wall humor

29:01.040 --> 29:03.440
maintaining a wisdom to goof ratio

29:03.440 --> 29:06.560
that listeners of MBMBAM might enjoy.

29:06.560 --> 29:10.080
And we keep it nice and pithy at around 20 minutes per week.

29:10.080 --> 29:12.240
We've just started the fourth book in the series.

29:12.240 --> 29:14.800
So now is the time to join.

29:14.800 --> 29:16.960
Man, how long you guys have been doing this show?

29:18.080 --> 29:19.840
There's like a lot of chapters there.

29:19.840 --> 29:20.720
You've already gotten through.

29:21.520 --> 29:22.880
I also like that they acknowledge

29:22.880 --> 29:25.040
that the first three books are bad

29:25.040 --> 29:27.600
and then it gets really good on the fourth book.

29:27.600 --> 29:29.680
More like the opposite of what you said

29:29.680 --> 29:32.880
because the first three are all about childlike fantasy.

29:32.880 --> 29:35.680
Oh shit, and I forgot Prisoner of Azkaban was number three.

29:35.680 --> 29:36.400
Now I take it back.

29:36.400 --> 29:37.680
Number three is when it starts to get good.

29:37.680 --> 29:41.280
What's the one where I stop being about childlike fantasy

29:41.280 --> 29:43.440
and all about like war and death?

29:43.440 --> 29:44.960
It's like, we get enough of that in real life.

29:44.960 --> 29:47.840
Just give me my Hufflepuff.

29:48.400 --> 29:50.000
Yeah, I'm with you on that.

29:50.000 --> 29:51.920
And I'm looking forward to listening

29:51.920 --> 29:54.560
to these kids read chapter titles.

29:54.560 --> 29:56.640
Are you drinking dad fuel right now?

29:58.640 --> 30:01.680
I just want these other podcasts to stay out the game.

30:01.680 --> 30:01.920
Yeah.

30:01.920 --> 30:03.200
Listen, it's 2013.

30:03.200 --> 30:05.920
There's not a lot of money, resources, or ears

30:06.640 --> 30:08.000
just lying around, you know?

30:08.000 --> 30:08.720
Hey, check this out.

30:08.720 --> 30:09.600
The Boy Who Lived.

30:09.600 --> 30:10.240
There's one.

30:10.240 --> 30:12.160
That's chapter one, book one.

30:12.720 --> 30:14.000
We just took that from you.

30:14.000 --> 30:14.480
Took that.

30:14.480 --> 30:15.520
That's ours now.

30:15.520 --> 30:16.560
These nuts.

30:18.080 --> 30:20.000
Harry and Hagrid reach an agreement.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.960
Harry and Hagrid reach an agreement.

30:26.080 --> 30:27.200
The worst wand.

30:29.040 --> 30:30.720
Defense against the fart arts.

30:31.520 --> 30:33.040
And not dark farts?

30:33.040 --> 30:34.400
What happened to you?

30:34.400 --> 30:35.760
What the fuck, Johnson?

30:35.760 --> 30:37.120
It's doing dad fuel.

30:37.120 --> 30:38.960
I have no kids here that I could dad.

30:39.520 --> 30:41.680
I'm just building up in my limbic system.

30:42.880 --> 30:44.480
My body's shutting down piecemeal.

30:44.480 --> 30:45.200
You need to vent.

30:45.200 --> 30:46.400
You need to open your exhaust.

30:46.400 --> 30:48.400
I went and opened my dad vents.

30:48.400 --> 30:49.120
Yeah.

30:49.120 --> 30:50.400
He's busted a fan belt.

30:52.240 --> 30:55.360
So be sure to check out the chapter titles are so good.com

30:55.360 --> 30:57.760
or search chapter titles in iTunes.

30:57.760 --> 31:01.200
And they will show up there and you can listen to it and enjoy it.

31:01.200 --> 31:04.640
And if you, speaking of enjoyment,

31:05.680 --> 31:09.920
guess who bought another 12 weeks of advertising with my brother, my brother.

31:09.920 --> 31:14.720
Lock it in for three goddamn, through May, through May.

31:14.720 --> 31:18.800
May, you are going to be hearing us talk about what?

31:19.920 --> 31:22.480
Extreme restraints.com.

31:22.480 --> 31:27.600
Your home for fucking and sucking and living and learning.

31:27.600 --> 31:28.240
And trucking.

31:28.240 --> 31:29.120
You know what's funny?

31:29.120 --> 31:32.880
There was a time, like two years ago,

31:32.880 --> 31:36.880
when Justin saying that sentence would have made me so uncomfortable.

31:36.880 --> 31:37.920
Not anymore.

31:37.920 --> 31:39.280
No barriers anymore.

31:39.280 --> 31:42.000
I can't sleep without listening to episodes

31:42.000 --> 31:44.480
where we talk about trucking and fucking and sucking.

31:44.480 --> 31:45.840
And ducking, duck tales.

31:45.840 --> 31:46.560
And shucking.

31:46.560 --> 31:47.360
And shucking.

31:47.360 --> 31:51.360
You want to get to this adult super store right now

31:51.360 --> 31:53.920
and get some herbal penis pills, Justin.

31:53.920 --> 31:57.120
This is more of a reminder to myself when I listen to this.

31:57.120 --> 32:00.000
Siri, I just wrote it on the back of my hand in Sharpie.

32:00.000 --> 32:01.920
Siri set calendar reminder.

32:02.800 --> 32:04.080
Herb max stamina.

32:05.520 --> 32:07.200
Special pills reminder.

32:07.760 --> 32:09.760
Send that to my personal account.

32:09.760 --> 32:10.160
Thank you.

32:10.160 --> 32:12.160
And pick up another nine pack of dad fuel.

32:12.160 --> 32:12.660
Cool.

32:14.080 --> 32:16.320
Why do they only sell it in nine packs?

32:16.320 --> 32:16.800
I have no idea.

32:16.800 --> 32:18.160
It's so inconvenient.

32:18.160 --> 32:18.660
I know.

32:19.360 --> 32:22.320
They do have max size male enhancement formula.

32:22.880 --> 32:24.480
So that's more of a cream.

32:26.000 --> 32:28.400
Look for max fun male enhancement formula.

32:28.960 --> 32:31.600
I've always said in order to make sure that you really maximize it

32:31.600 --> 32:32.880
and blow it up down there,

32:32.880 --> 32:37.200
you got to go both internal with some sort of pill

32:37.200 --> 32:39.440
and then you need a topical ointment.

32:39.440 --> 32:41.760
Oh, definitely.

32:41.760 --> 32:43.440
It's just going to stretch the inside.

32:43.440 --> 32:44.240
It's going to stretch the inside.

32:44.240 --> 32:45.200
You're going to get stretch marks.

32:45.200 --> 32:46.640
It's going to look like a zebra's neck.

32:48.800 --> 32:50.960
This is a site you can go to.

32:50.960 --> 32:52.640
Extremerestraints.com.

32:52.640 --> 32:55.360
It's going to be super private.

32:56.960 --> 33:02.320
It will be discreetly shipped to you in a box shaped like a dick.

33:02.320 --> 33:04.720
Is there like a second option?

33:04.720 --> 33:06.800
Because everyone talks about the discreetness.

33:06.800 --> 33:09.680
What if I want all my neighbors to know what's up?

33:09.680 --> 33:10.000
Yeah.

33:10.000 --> 33:13.200
Is there like an option where it arrives and the guy knocks on my door and says,

33:13.200 --> 33:16.000
hey, your special extra large condoms are here.

33:16.000 --> 33:16.800
Hello?

33:16.800 --> 33:17.360
Are you here?

33:17.360 --> 33:18.880
I want them to know.

33:18.880 --> 33:19.380
Yeah.

33:20.160 --> 33:23.920
They just bring you a giant crate like in a Christmas story.

33:23.920 --> 33:26.560
Only instead of saying fragile, it says like pussies.

33:28.400 --> 33:29.600
Just so people know.

33:29.600 --> 33:30.960
Let there be no doubt about it.

33:30.960 --> 33:34.240
If you head over and use the coupon code midlist at extremerestraints.com,

33:34.240 --> 33:38.240
you're going to save 20%, which is like one fifth of a dildo.

33:38.240 --> 33:41.680
Would you say that the website itself is discreet?

33:41.680 --> 33:47.280
Or is this the kind of thing that maybe you do on a small screened computer

33:47.280 --> 33:49.920
if your significant other is around?

33:51.120 --> 33:52.960
A little column A, a little column B.

33:53.520 --> 33:55.600
Maybe your significant other is into it.

33:55.600 --> 33:57.280
Maybe they don't know they're into it yet.

33:57.280 --> 34:00.160
Do they have like a secret skin that you can apply to the website

34:00.160 --> 34:03.040
to make it look like the Oprah television channel website?

34:03.040 --> 34:03.540
Yeah.

34:04.320 --> 34:08.160
And then there's like a picture of like the upcoming book of the month book,

34:08.160 --> 34:11.360
but the text of it is like secret dicks.

34:13.440 --> 34:13.940
Yeah.

34:14.560 --> 34:16.080
Just like what you said is there.

34:17.040 --> 34:18.320
And there's a boss button.

34:18.320 --> 34:21.360
So if your boss comes by and just click that, it looks like charts and stuff.

34:22.560 --> 34:27.040
But the chart is like how your boner will go when you put this cream on it.

34:27.040 --> 34:28.720
And it's just a line going upwards.

34:29.280 --> 34:30.080
So get over there.

34:30.080 --> 34:32.960
It's a time to boner X, Y access.

34:32.960 --> 34:34.240
So get over there.

34:34.240 --> 34:35.120
ExtremeSaints.com.

34:35.120 --> 34:35.760
Hi, Charlie.

34:35.760 --> 34:37.520
How much time will you spend fucking?

34:37.520 --> 34:39.120
But it's just one big blue circle.

34:39.120 --> 34:41.520
And the circle just says yes.

34:42.160 --> 34:42.660
All time.

34:44.400 --> 34:46.320
I'm new to the whole dating scene.

34:46.320 --> 34:51.440
Most of my previous boyfriends were dudes who orbited around my friend circle

34:52.400 --> 34:53.840
and conversation flowed easily.

34:53.840 --> 35:00.480
However, once the friend ratio of X's in my group started creeping towards a 40% mark,

35:00.480 --> 35:03.040
I figured it's probably time I started branching out.

35:03.040 --> 35:07.040
Problem is I don't know how to converse with the person I've just met in a way that's not awkward.

35:07.040 --> 35:11.360
Once I start trying to think of something to ask, panic sets in and I draw a total blank.

35:11.360 --> 35:14.640
It's the getting to know you questions that I struggle with the most.

35:14.640 --> 35:16.160
I don't know what's appropriate to ask.

35:16.160 --> 35:17.920
It might be considered prying.

35:17.920 --> 35:23.760
If you guys have any ideas past the obvious what do you do type thing, I'd love to hear it.

35:23.760 --> 35:24.960
That's from Gmail.

35:24.960 --> 35:25.920
I like this question.

35:25.920 --> 35:29.200
I like this question because it presupposes everything we've been chatting about,

35:29.200 --> 35:32.720
which is the best thing to do is to ask them questions, get interested in them,

35:32.720 --> 35:36.320
and don't be afraid to like start the conversation out about them.

35:36.320 --> 35:37.360
That's great.

35:37.360 --> 35:43.760
I think it's a very fair point because I think there are certain questions that seem like prying.

35:43.760 --> 35:51.600
But I actually get, I have problems with this when it's a person that I sort of know a little bit

35:51.600 --> 35:54.880
and I'm seeing them because like I'm always worried that I'm going to ask like,

35:54.880 --> 35:55.760
how's your dad?

35:55.760 --> 35:58.960
And you know, he's in jail again or something, you know,

35:58.960 --> 36:01.120
and I'll step into a landmine that I didn't mean to.

36:02.080 --> 36:05.120
Because you were so busy having an uncomfortable conversation

36:05.120 --> 36:08.080
that you weren't looking down at the minefield you were walking through.

36:08.080 --> 36:08.880
Right, exactly.

36:08.880 --> 36:11.520
I wonder, do you think now's really the time, Justin?

36:11.520 --> 36:12.400
Can we focus?

36:12.400 --> 36:14.320
No, I'm just wondering, you know, how's your family?

36:14.320 --> 36:15.120
They're all dead.

36:15.120 --> 36:16.000
Oh, no.

36:16.000 --> 36:16.560
Kaboom.

36:16.560 --> 36:17.060
Kaboom.

36:19.360 --> 36:25.360
This is like, I really do think that like having those kinds of conversations

36:25.360 --> 36:29.520
and getting to know somebody, like having those getting to know you conversations,

36:29.520 --> 36:32.160
it's a skill that you really do need to practice

36:32.160 --> 36:35.520
because it is different from having a conversation with just some rando

36:35.520 --> 36:37.200
if you're like on a date or whatever.

36:37.200 --> 36:41.600
I think that's why, I think that's sort of the reason that online dating is successful

36:42.640 --> 36:44.080
because it's like practice.

36:45.120 --> 36:47.040
It's like you can practice having these relationships

36:47.040 --> 36:51.040
and it's the most low stress scenario ever because if it fucks up, it's like, well,

36:51.600 --> 36:54.880
you know, there's so many people on the internet, you know, just look at Twitter.

36:55.760 --> 36:57.200
I'm like sitting here trying to think of a question

36:57.200 --> 37:00.480
that doesn't just make you sound like just a complete boner.

37:00.480 --> 37:00.960
Well, don't-

37:00.960 --> 37:03.760
It's like, well, the question was like, what I thought it's like,

37:03.760 --> 37:08.800
so, seen any good movies lately? And it's like, I think it's about the sincerity

37:08.800 --> 37:12.800
with which you ask it. And if you ask it like I just did, you sound like an asshole.

37:12.800 --> 37:16.400
But there's nothing, there's nothing sincere, there's nothing sincere about like,

37:16.400 --> 37:20.640
so tell me about yourself. Like, what? Like, what?

37:20.640 --> 37:24.800
I really, really like sour jelly bellies. Like, what the fuck do you want from me?

37:24.800 --> 37:28.000
Like, what do you want to know? That's not your, that's not yours to know.

37:28.000 --> 37:31.600
I think if you come at a date from the angle of an interrogation,

37:31.600 --> 37:36.240
like, you're just going to weird them and yourself out. Like, just talk to them.

37:36.240 --> 37:40.080
I think that's the issue. That's why I have such problems with meeting people in bars,

37:40.080 --> 37:46.800
because there's no context. If you're like at a movie screening, or you're like in a book club,

37:46.800 --> 37:51.200
or you're anywhere else, like you have things to talk about. But if you're at a bar,

37:51.200 --> 37:55.360
all you can say is, what are you drinking? And do you come to this bar often? Like,

37:56.240 --> 37:59.680
so do you like really loud house music? Or, oh, you don't? I mean, either.

37:59.680 --> 38:04.560
Have you tried Dad Fuel's Pale Ale? Oh, it's so good. They've used lots of hops.

38:05.360 --> 38:12.320
Hops for pops is what they call it. You could ask him the questions that

38:12.320 --> 38:15.120
James Lipton uses. Just go through those. Cycle through those.

38:15.680 --> 38:18.720
They would love that. Hey, so what's your favorite word? Oh,

38:18.720 --> 38:21.120
I'm Travis. Nice to meet you. What sound do you love?

38:21.760 --> 38:24.880
Boxers or briefs? I've never watched inside the acting studio.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.800
When you get to heaven- Dad Fuel or Dad Fuel? Trick question.

38:28.800 --> 38:31.920
I'm in marketing for Dad Fuel. To which side do you dress?

38:35.440 --> 38:37.360
Now I'm uncomfortable. Shoes or bow ties?

38:39.760 --> 38:43.680
I think that'd be great. Just set yourself up a set of flashcards that was all like,

38:43.680 --> 38:49.520
or questions that didn't have anything to do with one another. Flamingos or bathtubs?

38:49.520 --> 38:52.560
Oh, very interesting. Witches or sandwiches?

38:52.560 --> 39:00.640
And I do mean here witches that mainly practice their machinations in sand.

39:00.640 --> 39:04.960
Do you know what is really usually very successful is if you are at a bar or something and you're

39:04.960 --> 39:10.640
meeting somebody, just walk up to the person and then point to the person next to them and be like,

39:10.640 --> 39:17.120
this guy, right? I'm Griffin, by the way. Maybe offer him a Tums, because most of the

39:17.120 --> 39:20.800
time you could probably use one. I've got Yucky Tummy.

39:20.800 --> 39:24.400
I've got Yucky Tummy. Do you have Yucky Tummy? Pop one of these. I'm Griffin, by the way.

39:25.840 --> 39:28.240
This is going great. I think if you-

39:28.240 --> 39:31.920
I really feel like we've made a tummy connection. When you introduce yourself to somebody,

39:32.480 --> 39:38.480
if you say I'm and then your name, and then by the way, that's probably the worst five-

39:38.480 --> 39:43.440
I love it because it implies that you've just had a really long, in-depth conversation and

39:43.440 --> 39:46.640
failed to mention your name. But if you're like, hello, I'm Griffin, by the way.

39:46.640 --> 39:51.520
But that's- I played that- when I was in this person's shoes, just out of a relationship in

39:51.520 --> 39:56.800
college and had never really dated before, and would just be talking to some strange

39:56.800 --> 40:03.600
person I just met at a bar, and then we'd talk for 10 minutes about some shitty movie that we

40:03.600 --> 40:06.720
just saw, and then it's like, oh, I'm Griffin, by the way. I should have afforded you that

40:06.720 --> 40:12.800
information 10 minutes ago, maybe. Whoops. Movies do this all the time, though.

40:12.800 --> 40:18.320
Movies do this with a delayed title card, so you'll be watching Jake Sully run through

40:18.320 --> 40:23.440
the jungle for 10 minutes, and then after 10 minutes, it's like, oh, I'm Avatar, by the way.

40:24.480 --> 40:25.520
That's the movie I am.

40:25.520 --> 40:28.800
Maybe you should play it like that and be like, I'm Griffin, by the way. Directed by Griffin.

40:29.920 --> 40:32.080
Coming soon, and then leave the room.

40:32.720 --> 40:35.360
That was just a teaser, and then you come back and you say,

40:35.360 --> 40:37.680
it's time for the release date, by which I mean sex.

40:37.680 --> 40:41.760
Okay, next time you're talking to someone of the opposite sex and trying to pick them up,

40:41.760 --> 40:47.520
stop them after two minutes and 30 seconds and say, sorry, baby, this is just a trailer.

40:47.520 --> 40:50.880
Unless you're ready for the red band trailer, and then you get your dick back.

40:51.840 --> 40:53.920
In which case, I will meet you in the alley.

40:56.240 --> 40:58.720
I'm going to box office smash your pussy apart.

41:01.680 --> 41:02.240
Did I do good?

41:02.240 --> 41:06.480
I wanted to play along. You guys are playing like a fun game together, and I wanted to get in on it,

41:06.480 --> 41:10.720
but I didn't know. That was one of those conversations I could only sidestep into,

41:10.720 --> 41:13.360
and then say box office smash that pussy apart. I'm Griffin.

41:15.360 --> 41:22.000
You're welcome, guys. Great guys and so inclined girls. There's a great line you can use

41:22.560 --> 41:24.160
next time you're writing in a movie.

41:24.160 --> 41:27.200
It's the worst. Just get engaged as quick as you can, man.

41:27.200 --> 41:32.720
Nobody knows what they're doing up there. Griffin, how about a Yahoo question?

41:32.720 --> 41:36.800
Yeah, I'll give you one. Man, I got like six. I got six really good ones.

41:36.800 --> 41:37.300
Okay.

41:38.800 --> 41:42.560
This one may not be able to start much of a conversation. I just love it so much.

41:42.560 --> 41:46.320
I just sent it by Ben Hockenberry. Thanks, Ben. It's by Yahoo. It's his user.

41:46.320 --> 41:50.640
She's that one who asks, how do people on Jeopardy know the answers?

41:50.640 --> 41:57.440
Oh, God. Oh, my God.

41:57.440 --> 42:03.040
I don't know where that question is going to go, but I do just like-

42:03.040 --> 42:04.160
I just like that it exists.

42:04.160 --> 42:08.720
I like the picture of this gentleman watching Jeopardy and pulling his hair out, screaming.

42:08.720 --> 42:11.120
What kind of freak? How do they know this?

42:11.840 --> 42:13.200
This is amazing.

42:13.200 --> 42:15.280
Oh, my God. They have super powers.

42:15.280 --> 42:23.200

42:39.360 --> 42:42.640
one lady standing behind me and awkwardly staring at me strange so i said to her go

42:42.640 --> 42:46.160
ahead you don't just have to stand there and wait for me she gave me a disgusted look and

42:46.160 --> 42:49.820
said rudely whatever the way she was looking at me was beyond weird and treated me like

42:49.820 --> 42:53.940

43:00.320 --> 43:04.120

with that is is that in this world if you arrive at a supermarket at the same time as

45:16.400 --> 45:20.480
someone else who is also serpentining through the store and you arrive like three seconds

45:20.480 --> 45:26.440
after them you are guaranteed to look like the creepiest supermarket stalker ever because

45:26.440 --> 45:30.760
you're just like slowly winding behind them like oh you're getting ramen i'm gonna get

45:30.760 --> 45:35.720
ramen too turning right here that's funny oh yeah me too me too oh you get marshmallow

45:35.720 --> 45:39.480
fluff huh i haven't had a fluffer nutter in forever maybe that's how you do your small

45:39.480 --> 45:43.720
talk pick up lines it's everything they pick up oatmeal huh it's good for the constitution

45:43.720 --> 45:50.440
cool i love i have to have a list uh i like to do a little planning so i have some idea

45:50.440 --> 45:55.920
of what i'm gonna make uh but but i i always i always go the list i don't know how you

45:55.920 --> 46:00.360
guys know it's funny to me because you need just what you said like i i think lists are

46:00.360 --> 46:04.200
for people that can plan meals and i can't do that so i'll just like wind through the

46:04.200 --> 46:08.240
store and get whatever i want and then i'll get home and pull out the things that i want

46:08.240 --> 46:13.160
and be like what the fuck am i gonna make with pickles and peanut butter and oh jesus

46:13.160 --> 46:19.640
what was i thinking you say meal planning like i don't need a list to when i see spaghetti

46:19.640 --> 46:25.740
go yes spaghetti that is desirable to me or will be sometime within the next week week

46:25.740 --> 46:32.680
and a half yes i don't need a list do i like spaghetti help me list list says i like spaghetti

46:32.680 --> 46:38.480
so i'm gonna go ahead and pick this up but do i need grains i just don't know if you're

46:38.480 --> 46:43.280
gonna make a meal with like more than two components then it gets a little trickier

46:43.280 --> 46:47.960
what if i want to make swordfish piccata like i'm not gonna walk past the capers be like

46:47.960 --> 46:54.240
oh fuck looking good capers get in here oh briny and in a jar perfect that's just what

46:54.240 --> 47:01.040
i want get in here capers you and me are going on a caper but that's it but i feel like a

47:01.040 --> 47:05.600
shitty bat like a mean bouncer when i walk by the fruit by the foots and i'm like sorry

47:05.600 --> 47:10.480
fruit by the foots not on the list we already got too many fruit by the foots in this bar

47:10.480 --> 47:15.240
i'm suggesting you a plan that keeps you from buying fruit by the foot like i yeah i do

47:15.240 --> 47:21.200
need that structure i guess well then i need a list of mr money bags mr mr vip am i to

47:21.200 --> 47:26.520
say no to the chocolate covered gingerbread cookies yeah i need i need a list a do not

47:26.520 --> 47:34.840
buy list that my doctor made for me it's like you need to stop buying so much salted caramels

47:34.840 --> 47:39.280
that is why um i i do not allow myself to go to the store by myself anymore without

47:39.280 --> 47:44.000
teresa yeah because the gentle shame that she puts upon me when because when we walk

47:44.000 --> 47:51.080
in our local aldi because all these awesome the first like 30 feet is all bags of chips

47:51.080 --> 47:55.000
and i will just without thinking about it crap like eight bags of chips yeah and the

47:55.000 --> 47:59.240
gentle shaming that tree sit and that's like every week the gentle shaming that trisa will

47:59.240 --> 48:03.120
lay down on me and be like oh cheese puffs huh oh and burritos i feel like i feel oh

48:03.120 --> 48:07.080
oh and you're getting the wavy chips oh and the regular chips i feel like uh i feel like

48:07.080 --> 48:10.080
i've talked about this before but rachel and i when we go grocery shopping she starts

48:10.080 --> 48:12.960
on one end of the store with a cart and i start on the other end of the store with a

48:12.960 --> 48:16.440
cart and then we meet in the middle and once we meet in the middle we go we go check out

48:16.440 --> 48:24.360
have i talked about this before this this amazing 12 minute long grocery shopping maneuver

48:24.360 --> 48:28.680
the only how do you do that without a list i and how do you do that without not meeting

48:28.680 --> 48:32.720
in the middle and her going why did you get 18 boxes of cookies well it's because i'm

48:32.720 --> 48:37.360
well i'm a grown-ass man um but also because i man can eat cookies i mostly just buy the

48:37.360 --> 48:42.720
same things every time i shop which is uh unfortunate because she starts in produce

48:42.720 --> 48:48.680
and i start on the far far end of the store where they put the bad foods um so without

48:48.680 --> 48:56.440
fail every time i start my journey the first two things i put in my cart at the heb grocery

48:56.440 --> 49:02.960
store is toilet paper and low-fat ice cream sandwiches so somebody who sees me at the

49:02.960 --> 49:09.400
beginning of my odyssey is like this man has very specific plans for the evening and that

49:09.400 --> 49:15.800
is to party on some skinny cow ice cream sandwiches and then poop and wipe butts you have to be

49:15.800 --> 49:20.520
so careful when you're buying toilet paper i have a bad habit of like i'll go to ride

49:20.520 --> 49:25.840
aid because i need toilet paper and then i'll get like one other thing and i always feel

49:25.840 --> 49:34.200
like the subtle message i'm sending is this makes me poop i went to wall greens yesterday

49:34.200 --> 49:40.040
to buy batteries and uh was reminded that it was discount valentine's day candy time

49:40.040 --> 49:46.240
oh shit and so like i couldn't stop myself i bought three boxes like heart-shaped boxes

49:46.240 --> 49:50.520
of chocolates to be shared with me and my fiance and then i realized that when i walked

49:50.520 --> 49:56.180
up the counter i was buying a pack of batteries and some like outdated valentine's day candy

49:56.180 --> 50:00.600
and i just couldn't i couldn't even think about what message i was sending to this poor

50:00.600 --> 50:07.120
man that was ringing me out except for wow this is a sad guy poor guy but then i ate

50:07.120 --> 50:11.880
all of that chocolate in one day so who's the sad guy now what's great about my maneuver

50:11.880 --> 50:15.960
is sometimes we don't meet each other in the middle and you make to the other side of the

50:15.960 --> 50:21.560
store it's like well double chili this week i guess guess it's double chili week fuck

50:21.560 --> 50:25.760
perfect and ice cream sandwiches always melt by the time you get to the cashier so you

50:25.760 --> 50:30.960
guys just get cans of chili sometimes yeah yeah that'd be dope i wish i could have a

50:30.960 --> 50:35.640
can of chili do it it's healthy chili you get a thing like a block of obd you melt them

50:35.640 --> 50:41.440
together you have some delicious chip dip well i decided i was thinking like wolf's

50:41.440 --> 50:46.160
turkey chili it's like you know it's like 280 calories but that's like your whole meal

50:46.160 --> 50:50.760

stanek here's a weird thing i noticed uh this week if you search have you guys noticed so

53:40.720 --> 53:46.320
soon you can taste it yes yeah you have noticed this that's like a spam it's like a spam bot

53:46.320 --> 53:53.880
right there's a spam bot that tweets so soon you can taste it period period mbnbam and

53:53.880 --> 53:59.440
if you search for that specific phrase there's like 30 spam bots that have used that specific

53:59.440 --> 54:03.780
phrase which i find that very endearing because i think it's just like a thing that they say

54:03.780 --> 54:09.560
so that they're so that they're like their shitty accounts don't get caught for being

54:09.560 --> 54:17.640
spam bots so like our show is like a heuristic for seeming like you're a human being oh so

54:17.640 --> 54:23.160
this is like the new turing test right right anybody who talks about like no robot knows

54:23.160 --> 54:27.760
