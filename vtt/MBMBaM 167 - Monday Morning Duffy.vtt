WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:44.320
It's a new craze, and good girls do you wanna just say, hey, I wanna, just say, hey, I wanna.

00:44.320 --> 00:47.920
Welcome, my brother, my brother, and the advice show from the modern era. I'm your oldest brother,

00:47.920 --> 00:51.600
Justin McElroy. I'm your middle brother, Travis McElroy. I'm your baby's baby brother,

00:51.600 --> 00:56.640
Griffin McElroy. We spoke on this last week. I wanted to update everyone in our listening audience.

00:56.640 --> 01:03.120
Refresher correction, retraction, and updates. No, updates. Start with an update. We spoke

01:03.120 --> 01:09.680
last week about unusual animal pairings, and how they always start off with negligence.

01:11.600 --> 01:14.640
I found this new one on CNN that I wanted to mention to you guys.

01:15.840 --> 01:22.240
Dallas Zoo brings in puppy to calm down cheetahs. Yeah. No.

01:22.240 --> 01:27.440
Does it mean because the cheetahs chase the puppies and wear themselves out?

01:28.080 --> 01:33.920
They get so tired eating puppies. I'm gonna lay down, take a nap.

01:34.560 --> 01:40.480
Can you imagine that puppy, like, are you sure this is, I've only been alive for like two months.

01:40.480 --> 01:47.120
Are you sure this is cool? Cause those look like giant cats, which I'm already not crazy about that

01:47.120 --> 01:52.800
whole genus. Listen, in this economy, I'm really happy for the work, so thank you, first and

01:52.800 --> 01:58.960
foremost, but hard out there for a contract. I'm looking at the contract here, and it says that

01:58.960 --> 02:06.000
there is a significant chance I'm going to be, if I read this correctly, consumed. Consumed wholesale.

02:06.000 --> 02:10.960
Is this, I know I'm a puppy and my reading skills, not so great. So can you confirm or

02:10.960 --> 02:18.080
deny that this says the puppy will be consumed guaranteed? So I'm sorry to that puppy. I'm also

02:18.080 --> 02:25.360
sorry to, and God, I can't, this is, this is the website for CNN. Stubs the cat. Alaska town mayor

02:25.360 --> 02:35.280
mauled by dog. Is there nothing? God, they just can't, they just can't let, can't let a cat get

02:35.280 --> 02:43.360
ahead, can they? Fucking Malcolm X, Martin Luther King, JFK, the government will take down any leader

02:43.360 --> 02:48.400
that they don't, uh, that they don't agree with. Now Stubs the cat, uh, has been mauled by the

02:48.400 --> 02:53.920
opposition dog. It's a fucking terrible world out there. Let's all, let's all go around the circle

02:53.920 --> 02:58.960
and talk about the most terrible thing that that is happening right now. Travis, Justin, we know

02:58.960 --> 03:06.560
yours. Okay. Is this, is this mish-mashing of unlike animals. It's a shame, said Ashley Curds,

03:06.560 --> 03:12.560
who works at the pizza shop in the small town 110 miles north of Anchorage. He's the mayor.

03:12.560 --> 03:18.320
It's not a joke. I know it's ridiculous, but the town is run really well.

03:18.320 --> 03:27.440
Oh, this is the fucking libertarian dream. I know cats in power, no laws, legal weed.

03:30.400 --> 03:33.360
Cabinet for everyone. I'll tell you my thing tonight,

03:34.320 --> 03:38.240
Carrie Underwood is going to perform the NFL Sunday night football theme song.

03:39.120 --> 03:44.800
Um, the, the song has been waiting all day for Sunday night, which just seems like a child,

03:44.800 --> 03:49.440
like an impatient child would say. There are so many things you can do during Sunday day that

03:49.440 --> 03:54.160
are great, but she's replacing Faith Hill. Like they won't expect us to fucking notice.

03:54.800 --> 04:00.080
Like they won't. Oh, a pretty blonde country singer. That must be Faith Hill. She's looking good.

04:01.520 --> 04:06.320
Wait, it's your model, huh? It's, it's a, it's a fucking crying shame. I'm sure she'll do a great

04:06.320 --> 04:11.840
job, but like, what else does Faith have? Her and Tim are on the outs, I think. Well,

04:11.840 --> 04:16.560
do you guys want to hear some good news? I thought I explicitly said only bad things though.

04:18.000 --> 04:25.280
Can you frame the good news in a bad way? Yeah. So they're remaking Robocop. What the fuck?

04:25.280 --> 04:33.280
But also my Michael Keaton's in it. So he's not dead. Michael Keaton is alive and he's a Robocop.

04:33.280 --> 04:38.320
That's a job. Michael Keaton. Let's help. You know, I'm tired of, I'm tired of hurting people.

04:38.320 --> 04:43.440
I want to pick their spirits back up and help them out. So this is an advice show. So let's do that.

04:44.720 --> 04:50.240
I'm about to start announcing girls' volleyball games. What are some calls I can give to pump up

04:50.240 --> 04:56.720
the crowd? And that's from priming to pump in Castle Rock, CO. That's Colorado, right? It's

04:56.720 --> 05:03.840
Columbus. They're in Castle Rock, Columbus. This is so important. I'm so glad to see you can't

05:03.840 --> 05:11.040
just start pumping people up unless you yourself have pumped yourself. I think you have to be

05:11.040 --> 05:17.360
pre-pumped to pump a crowd up and then by the end of it you should be just deflated. I think Dale

05:17.360 --> 05:22.320
Carnegie said that, didn't he? Yeah. He said you can't expect people to pump you if you don't pump

05:22.320 --> 05:27.840
them in exchange. Can I start? This is a circle of pumping. Can I recommend that you kick off

05:27.840 --> 05:33.920
every volleyball game with a new custom theme song from Faith Hill, who now has a lot more time in

05:33.920 --> 05:40.400
her schedule, like Waitin' All Afternoon for Thursday evening at the JC. She has to change

05:40.400 --> 05:46.080
some of the words or else Carrie Underwood. Waitin' All Week for Bump Set Spike. Ooh,

05:46.080 --> 05:50.960
that fucking goddamn! Auto-tune that shit and we are halfway there.

05:52.560 --> 05:55.600
And just getting Faith Hill. That's the only other thing. And Faith Hill, yes. Well,

05:55.600 --> 05:58.640
I think if we auto-tune you enough we can make you sound like Faith Hill.

06:00.640 --> 06:05.600
When you say calls to pump up the crowd, does that mean like you're saying to them like get

06:05.600 --> 06:12.080
pumped or like your reaction to exciting things that just happened? Maybe they are in some sort

06:12.080 --> 06:18.480
of dictatorial city state where like they just shout commands over a megaphone and then everybody

06:18.480 --> 06:25.040
else has to like stand or clap in compliance. Killer shot! Now it's time for government-mandated

06:25.040 --> 06:31.520
push-ups! Yeah, yeah. Jump rope for heart. Or else. Every. Jump rope. Jump rope or we'll

06:31.520 --> 06:34.640
detonate the tiny bomb installed in everyone's heart by the government.

06:35.760 --> 06:42.400
It's Kim Trails, guys. This is like basic 101 shit. Loose change. You guys know about Kim Trails,

06:42.400 --> 06:46.880
right? They're fucking everything. They're everything and everywhere. I feel like the only

06:46.880 --> 06:53.440
thing you can do at any sports event anymore is play the theme from Space Jam. Like when they're

06:53.440 --> 07:01.040
talking about uh we got a new jam going welcome to the slam like that's gonna get people so so

07:01.040 --> 07:05.120
pumped. Maybe but there are many sports where slamming and jamming are the operative verbs.

07:06.080 --> 07:10.400
There's very little slamming and or jamming in like water polo. No actually there's probably

07:10.400 --> 07:14.720
some jamming but I don't think there's any slamming in water polo. I think it's mostly

07:14.720 --> 07:22.720
just like trying to try not to drown and throwing. So try not to drown and then you throw the ball.

07:22.720 --> 07:30.640
Quad City DJs could do a different theme song for every sport. Hi-Li. Just stay the fuck stay safe.

07:30.640 --> 07:38.960
It's a very dangerous sport. It's a very heavy ball. It travels very quickly. So scoop it up

07:38.960 --> 07:45.120
and then tighten your pants. They have tight pants on Hi-Li I think. Not familiar. I don't

07:45.120 --> 07:49.840
think you can tighten pants when you have hook hands on. Although that'd be really fun to see.

07:49.840 --> 07:55.680
If someone's pants fall down on the fucking Hi-Li court. You're done. You're done. Oh god I need

07:55.680 --> 08:01.360
ah I need a fan in the audience to jump down and help me. Time out. Yeah you just if that happens

08:01.360 --> 08:08.400
you start using your scoops to dig him a grave because he is dead. Wait do the fans have to wear

08:08.400 --> 08:13.920
scoops too? I've never seen Hi-Li. Everyone wears the scoops in case they need to get called in.

08:13.920 --> 08:18.400
Oh it's just like when someone wears everyone wears a mitt like a baseball game to catch foul

08:18.400 --> 08:23.840
balls you wear the scoops so that you don't die in the crowd. Is this what about like is it uh

08:26.880 --> 08:36.400
is it teen school volleyball or is it like um is it uh raunchy beach volleyball? Because that's

08:36.400 --> 08:42.080
an incredibly important distinction to okay so let's do for both because I'm gonna say for like

08:42.080 --> 08:48.240
the high school teens say stuff like uh get on your feet and cheer for these girls potential.

08:48.240 --> 08:55.600
Yeah. I would love to be at that game. They have bright futures ahead of them in whatever career

08:55.600 --> 09:02.640
they choose. Yeah. And the other one is beach volleyball and you're like jug of bugs. The

09:02.640 --> 09:14.080
juggy one spiked the other juggy one whoo. Millie time. Keep an eye out here comes the

09:14.080 --> 09:22.560
jug cannon where we shoot distant body jugs at the crowd. It's a health code violation that's

09:22.560 --> 09:31.760
why you signed a waver wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-waver. Maybe. Maybe. I'm on board. Maybe you set the

09:31.760 --> 09:38.400
volleyball on fire somehow. Whoa. Could you do what bowling alleys do and just make it like

09:38.400 --> 09:42.800
extreme cosmic volleyball and like make the net glow in the dark and like the ball glow and

09:42.800 --> 09:46.640
everybody's got like war paint on. Hey what happened gentlemen I think we've extended our

09:46.640 --> 09:51.760
plan beyond the reach of what you can accomplish as an announcer at the game. I mean you could

09:51.760 --> 09:57.440
demand that the ball be set on fire all you want from your shitty booth but I don't think anybody's

09:57.440 --> 10:01.600
gonna listen to you. What kind of high school wait whoa hold on what kind of a high school

10:01.600 --> 10:06.720
volleyball court do you think this is or they have an announcing booth? I think yeah it's it is a

10:06.720 --> 10:12.800
fucking fold out is the lunch table that has been poorly converted. I think the way you get people

10:12.800 --> 10:16.880
pumped up is you shout these suggestions of ways to make the sport more awesome.

10:17.920 --> 10:24.640
Like put some pumas out there with um yeah clap if you like. That spike now imagine if it had been

10:24.640 --> 10:30.240
glow in the dark am I right people leave your suggestions on your way out. What if his volleyball

10:30.240 --> 10:38.800
court was in a rancor pit from star wars like what are you talking about? Demand that the audience

10:38.800 --> 10:45.360
imagine these things like you don't have to make it happen just and now for the next time things

10:45.360 --> 10:51.280
with the hitting we're all gonna imagine it's on fire. Get on your feet let me paint you a picture

10:51.280 --> 10:59.040
with my words. Griffin how about a yahoo? Yeah sure uh this yahoo was sent in by Julie Kin thank

10:59.040 --> 11:06.160
you Julie Kin it's by yahoo answers user Casey Cherry who asks what to wear with a black cape?

11:08.080 --> 11:14.160
I bought it ages ago so I can't really find a picture for you. It has one tab fastening like

11:14.160 --> 11:20.400
and then there's a pic of what a cape fastener looks like. No it doesn't have a collar it doesn't

11:20.400 --> 11:24.640
look right with anything other than tank tops but it's getting colder and I want to find something

11:24.640 --> 11:30.240
warmer to wear under it what would be the best color thing to wear with it? Now um this is not

11:31.600 --> 11:40.560
a Dracula costume cape it's just it's just like a black maybe wool cape. There is not a single word

11:40.560 --> 11:49.840
in that question that doesn't hurt my heart. It only looks good with a tank top. That person they're

11:49.840 --> 11:56.560
a human on the same planet you yourself live on listener that recently maybe not so recently

11:56.560 --> 12:00.320
because they apparently can't find the cape that they so desperately want to wear to take a picture

12:00.320 --> 12:07.520
of it that that person stood in front of a full-length mirror with a black cape and a fuchsia

12:07.520 --> 12:14.480
tank top and adjusted their top hat and thought yes this is a look. Now okay let me go further

12:14.480 --> 12:19.520
with this picture with words. Imagine like one of those movie montages where the people go to try

12:19.520 --> 12:24.320
out new looks for like the nerdy guy and like he keeps coming out of the dressing room and they're

12:24.320 --> 12:29.920
like no or like yeah but it's just a string of him standing quietly in front of the mirror

12:29.920 --> 12:40.400
cape and sweater. No. No. Cape and winter jacket. No. Cape and tank top. Yeah. Yeah I found it.

12:40.400 --> 12:47.520
Cape and smaller cape that you wear in the front. They call that a bib. Jacob it's a bib.

12:47.520 --> 12:54.320
It's a big joke. Cape and school marm dress. Yes. No not oh so close. Boy that could really spice up

12:54.320 --> 12:59.600
your visits to Red Lobster though if you told everybody you're wearing a front cape. Or just

12:59.600 --> 13:03.760
trying to avoid getting butter on you. If you can't afford a nice high quality cape from from

13:03.760 --> 13:11.040
Nordstrom Rack you just when you're done consuming your crab butter mass then you just flip that

13:11.040 --> 13:18.160
sloppy bib. Flip that sloppy bib. Put it on your back and you got a you got a floppy grease cape.

13:18.160 --> 13:24.240
You're gonna fight so much crime. So much crustacean crime. I would be afraid of a person

13:24.240 --> 13:29.680
doing that to be fair. It's the buttery mess. Get out of here. Get out of here. Everybody run.

13:29.680 --> 13:34.560
His hands are like cheddar bay biscuits. He's gonna grease us up. Can that be a YouTube meme

13:34.560 --> 13:39.200
like the kids who go to the through like McDonald's and they grab the ice cream cone from the wrong

13:39.200 --> 13:45.760
end or like a thing that you do to just like totally freak out. Yeah it's like a kid thing

13:45.760 --> 13:50.160
that kids do on YouTube. They order ice cream from McDonald's and then like they hand the

13:50.160 --> 13:55.840
cashier hands them the ice cream and they grab it by the ice cream. It freaks people shit out.

13:55.840 --> 13:59.840
Like it's a pretty good goof but like I I think that the food service industry needs to be

13:59.840 --> 14:09.200
tormented I guess. If we uh if we like podcast wide agree that grabbing the ice cream by the ice

14:09.200 --> 14:14.320
cream part is a quote pretty good goof. Yeah. I think that explains a lot about the quality of

14:14.320 --> 14:20.960
our show over the past few months. I'm I I listen I'm all about shattering expectations and that's

14:20.960 --> 14:26.160
what these people are doing one one scoop at a time. I think you flip that bib around. People

14:26.160 --> 14:30.960
are gonna be confused. They're gonna talk. I think that I'll go to really take at the right lobster

14:30.960 --> 14:36.000
saying oh thank you so much could I get some extra bibs to take home with me. I think that

14:36.000 --> 14:42.240
would be enough to really just I don't know I frightened the the waiter or waitress. I'm I'm

14:42.240 --> 14:47.200
I'm doing something and I don't want to get into it but it involves a lot of a lot of clarified

14:47.200 --> 14:53.920
butter. Let me put it discreetly. I'm a sloppy boy. Real sloppy sloppy poppy. Sloppy boy.

14:53.920 --> 15:02.080
Um I think you can there's a way to make a fucking cape work for you. I think there's not

15:02.080 --> 15:08.320
everybody right. Do you think everybody can pull off a cape. Not everybody no and like let's just

15:08.320 --> 15:14.480
let's just shadow the illusion that tank tops can fit. Tank tops don't go with anything. You wear

15:14.480 --> 15:18.640
them because it's so hot and humid outside and you don't want anything on your arms or your

15:18.640 --> 15:23.280
shoulders or your pits. That is the only context that you wear a tank top. You don't say. Griffin

15:23.280 --> 15:26.960
I know that you live in Austin. Have you crumbled to tank top pressure yet? I'll never wear a

15:26.960 --> 15:33.600
fucking tank top. Although I see dudes who do that wear like the full blown Rastafarian like neck

15:33.600 --> 15:43.360
cut down to their ball sack and I'm like god you look so dry. You look so dry and so comfy and I

15:43.360 --> 15:49.120
I'm sitting there in my stupid v-neck t-shirt. There is I think there are very few clothing

15:49.120 --> 15:56.400
items. Actually you know what maybe this is why the cape and the tank top uh work together so well

15:57.040 --> 16:03.920
is that they are both items with an extremely high risk reward. I mean if you can nail the tank top

16:03.920 --> 16:08.480
look. What is the reward of the cape? What is the what is the surprise? Okay but think about it this

16:08.480 --> 16:15.120
way. It lets you blend it in the shadows. If you can if you are wearing the cape there is a 99%

16:15.120 --> 16:23.920
chance that just you're king dipshit but if you nail it oh my god forget about it you're the mayor

16:23.920 --> 16:29.440
you and that cat are co-mayor. Justin I just need to know real quick what would nailing it

16:29.440 --> 16:36.880
in wearing a cape entail? Travis the odds against nailing a cape as an ensemble choice are so narrow

16:36.880 --> 16:42.000
that I myself like if I could just sit here and tell you how to make a cape work I I wouldn't be

16:42.000 --> 16:48.480
on a podcast I'd be fucking gallivanting on the Riviera wooing heiresses like I feel like the one

16:48.480 --> 16:54.000
the one chance for it to quote be nailed is if you're wearing the cape you're getting picked on

16:54.000 --> 16:59.840
by some bullies or people making fun of you but then a cry rings out from the alley you rush in

16:59.840 --> 17:04.720
save a woman from a mugger or something a fucking superhero and then it's like you know I then

17:04.720 --> 17:11.280
wearing the cape is justified for about 30 minutes but other than that I cannot envision a circumstance

17:11.280 --> 17:15.200
in which you are wearing a cape and somebody looks at you and goes yeah it's justified if

17:15.200 --> 17:18.960
you could emerge from the shadows I bet you could sneak a lot of hoagies into a football game

17:20.880 --> 17:27.040
here comes count hoagie smell like onions and roast beef count hoagie and his dream

17:27.040 --> 17:35.600
code of mini sandwiches there was ham and salami and cheddar and biscuits and cheese

17:35.600 --> 17:43.680
and mustard and there's a little show tunes humor for you how about a new question so I'm a 21 year

17:43.680 --> 17:50.800
old guy in college and I just adopted my first pet it's a cat named Leonardo Dicatio he's cool

17:50.800 --> 17:55.760
but he's extremely bitey all the time when he's happy when he's sad when he's playful whatever

17:55.760 --> 17:59.680
he bites the crap out of you he's only six months old so I'm hoping he'll grow out of this

had any physical contact with this fucking cat this cat is is a goddamn hologram for all I know

19:43.040 --> 19:50.320
Justin has invented some sort of clever hologram cat technology that is I can't you can't do it

19:50.320 --> 19:56.240
the cat and a cat has a sweet deal because the cat's like okay you know I'll eat oh and all

just waddle uh waddle away I still catch everybody I'm so panicked ah what am I gonna do in the in

adding insult to injury the small cat the spookable one Amelia she will like literally

20:20.720 --> 20:27.680
if CJ lies down for a couple minutes the cat will like envelop herself into CJ she'll use CJ

20:27.680 --> 20:33.600
like a parka and just wrap herself like okay on so it's not physical contact yes exactly Travis

20:33.600 --> 20:39.120
she'll climb into CJ's fat and control herself like a Pacific like a Jaeger from Pacific Rim

20:39.760 --> 20:47.760
yeah but but no a human a human who controls like money and food and has invented shit yeah

20:47.760 --> 20:54.800

Galaxy the cat behavior specialist the the cat whisperer this guy the guy that looks like a

21:46.000 --> 21:51.920
fucking rock star uh I guess if that's what your definition of a rock star let me let me

21:51.920 --> 21:56.800
rephrase is he the guy who looks like a failed bassist he looks like yes he looks like four

21:56.800 --> 22:01.840
different bassists all rolled together he's got don't be disturbed when Jackson Galaxy shows up

22:01.840 --> 22:09.120
to your house with his crazy wraparound goggle glasses and his anthrax beard and his mutton chops

22:09.120 --> 22:14.800
and his his Michael Stipe bald head like a frankenbassist he's a frankenbassist but I tell

22:14.800 --> 22:22.560
you what he will take your cat from a zero to a four not to a hero cats can't be heroes but to

22:22.560 --> 22:29.200
our cats have a pretty good deal uh we have an understanding now where if they do something bad

22:29.200 --> 22:36.720
what I do is I spray them with the spray bottle of water that I keep next to the couch at all times

22:36.720 --> 22:43.120
like some sort of alcoholic father but I spray them with the spray bottle and then they know

22:43.120 --> 22:48.720
immediately they go to Sydney and start rubbing on her to indicate their wetness at which point

22:48.720 --> 22:55.120
I get in trouble for spraying the cats so it's a whole it's a whole circle we have worked out it's

22:55.120 --> 23:00.320
really great um on the real though do you know what fixed my cat started putting that motherfucker

23:00.320 --> 23:06.080
outside it's hard out there isn't it pretty soft pretty sweet you got in here huh no no I think

23:06.080 --> 23:10.880
it's outside time I think someone's forgotten I think someone's forgotten about the giant metal

23:10.880 --> 23:16.800
dragons that live outside have fun what we did is we just started putting a harness on the cat

23:16.800 --> 23:20.560
like we were going to walk her but we just put the harness on her and she just immediately like

23:20.560 --> 23:25.200
lays flat on the ground and doesn't move until you take the harness off and it's like this weird

23:25.200 --> 23:29.840
kind of force field of like it just completely cancels out all of her willpower and soul we

23:29.840 --> 23:35.520
actually had one of those for Travis from ages three to seven team uh I uh people got pissed

23:35.520 --> 23:40.240
off at me when I instagrammed and vine pictures of my cat in a harness and a leash as you're

23:40.240 --> 23:44.960
training it to go outside like cats aren't supposed to do that like yeah I guess what dogs

23:44.960 --> 23:50.640
probably aren't either like it's just like we do that with them like I don't think dogs like a dog

23:50.640 --> 23:55.360
in the wild you never see like a hyena in a harness yeah dogs aren't like oh restrictions cool

23:56.160 --> 23:59.760
no they're like I just because I'm not an animal who likes to run and play yeah

24:01.600 --> 24:06.880
um you gotta y'all gotta watch this fucking Jackson Galaxy show you think your fucking cat

24:06.880 --> 24:13.440

24:18.960 --> 24:24.880
piss up its his nose then he leans into your it leans into his ear and says I stole your identity

24:28.960 --> 24:34.080
there are episodes of that show that are like the goddamn exorcist for Jackson Galaxy like

24:34.080 --> 24:37.440
Jackson Galaxy's dead because one cat like threw him down a flight of stairs

24:37.440 --> 24:42.480

yeah dead wife dead wife that episode where like everybody left the kitchen to go get pizza and

37:41.680 --> 37:47.200
danny was left alone and just quietly looked into his drink mother's dead wife that was a great

37:47.200 --> 37:54.960
half hour of comedy um how about uh my rippers and that's jesse he's talking about someone asks

37:54.960 --> 37:59.360
hey who are the other members of your band he says oh my rippers he doesn't say oh because

37:59.360 --> 38:10.000
it's just two words meth please and that was uh jody sweeten because she is it too soon to joke

38:10.000 --> 38:16.480
about her it's too soon to joke about not soon enough actually no one's gonna get that comet's

38:16.480 --> 38:26.560
dead comet never died he lives on in our hearts sag it chop and that was when bob saget great

38:26.560 --> 38:31.600
fight when yeah when did you guys ever notice how there were like a crazy amount of fight scenes in

38:31.600 --> 38:38.160
tgif shows fucking fucking step by step did one like literally every third episode patrick i think

38:38.160 --> 38:42.160
patrick duffy had like something in his contract where he's like i need to i actually don't think

38:42.160 --> 38:47.120
that's a joke griffin i think that crash of duffy because you're right and you could tell because

38:47.120 --> 38:53.600
the camera because this was a multi-camera comedy yeah the camera would take this very odd angle

38:53.600 --> 38:58.720
that it never really takes where you see how small the set actually is because it's basically

38:58.720 --> 39:03.920
just looking at dead on and you could smell like oh man patrick duffy's about to beat some ass

39:03.920 --> 39:08.240
it really was it like every time they went to a bar every time there was a scene in a bar you're

39:08.240 --> 39:13.120
like oh duffy's about to do some whoopings i feel like that happened a lot in like there were always

39:13.120 --> 39:17.680
people challenging people to something and like it's every time there wanted to be a lesson about

39:17.680 --> 39:22.000
like what it really means to stand up to a bully or like use your brain the answer there was one

39:22.000 --> 39:29.440
fucking episode where urkel in family matters like there was a rope climbing challenge and like the

39:29.440 --> 39:34.640
one of the jocks challenged him to a rope climbing competition like everyone had happened to them in

39:34.640 --> 39:43.200
high school it was very relatable and so to win urkel fucking built a jet pack what jim t-shirt

39:43.200 --> 39:49.200
travis what is the relevance of this anecdote no i suddenly just started thinking about that's

39:49.200 --> 39:54.320
fucking cheating what are we teaching our children yeah yeah it's like that one physical prowess out

39:54.320 --> 40:00.400
the window just fucking cheat in these fucking teen sitcoms the writers were eventually like

40:00.400 --> 40:06.080
well the the the challenges of high school are getting kind of boring let's have them beat the

40:06.080 --> 40:14.400
shit out of each other can we get duffy in the mix that was a weird crossover episode where uh

40:14.400 --> 40:20.480
corey fought patrick duffy patrick duffy that's a quote that patrick duffy would say i mean say

40:20.480 --> 40:29.760
his own name because he's a pokemon patrick duffy patrick duffy duffy pat pat pat pat pat pat pat

40:29.760 --> 40:45.040
patrick duffy duffy use chop duffy duffy use acting patrick duffy duffy hasn't learned this

40:45.040 --> 40:52.400
duffy only has room for four moves he knows chop chopping chop they're saying patrick duffy top eat

40:52.400 --> 40:58.320
drugs and walk just forget jumping over the general lee forget that skill you don't need

40:58.320 --> 41:08.080
it anymore duff he refuses you never know okay fine boy that's a fucking bitter pill when uh

41:08.880 --> 41:15.840
you do not get the cat the call to uh reunite in the new iteration of dallas that's got to be

41:15.840 --> 41:21.840
bitter when uh even larry hagman's getting the call brink of death's door and then proceeding

41:21.840 --> 41:27.120
through death's door larry hagman gets the call to be on the new dallas and you patrick duffy

41:27.120 --> 41:32.720
the the phone just quiet quiet as i'll get out he's he's busy writing his one-man stage show

41:33.600 --> 41:37.200
he he wouldn't have time for it anyways you guys wouldn't understand the life of a professional

41:37.200 --> 41:40.560
actor but he's pretty busy and he would have turned him down if they called him anyways

41:41.280 --> 41:46.240
do you think every time patrick duffy's life has taken a turn for the worse which i imagine

41:46.240 --> 41:51.600
has pretty much has been constantly since step by step one off the air that he's just waiting

41:51.600 --> 41:57.600
to like wake up and it was all a dream and he just like steps out of the shower and he's like

41:57.600 --> 42:05.440
patrick duffy and his wife is like no it's it's still it's still real life patrick duffy

42:05.440 --> 42:13.920
it's still real life oh duffy have you guys seen and this is gonna one of the earliest uh

42:14.720 --> 42:19.840
one of the earliest like internet sensations was uh patrick duffy and the crab are you guys

42:19.840 --> 42:27.440
familiar with this this this had bypassed me for a long time but there is a series of videos

42:28.000 --> 42:32.880
if you look out there on the internet about patrick duffy and his life with a stuffed crab

42:32.880 --> 42:38.560
puppet named the crab like in one episode the crab teaches patrick duffy about facebook and ringtones

42:39.520 --> 42:44.640
they watch top model together yeah this is a thing you could in one episode the crab dares patrick to

42:44.640 --> 42:49.680
eat a dime that that's just a thing you can watch on the internet is definitely gonna make a comeback

42:50.960 --> 42:54.880
i feel like duffy's like right on the edge i feel like he's on the cusp and i feel like we're doing

42:54.880 --> 42:59.760
the lord's work with this podcast this this duffy centric app if patrick duffy were a pokemon what

42:59.760 --> 43:04.720
type would it be because i would say fighting maybe psychic oh i was gonna say water based

43:04.720 --> 43:10.240
why is he water based because he he's able to elicit tears with the power of his act i guess

43:10.240 --> 43:17.680
that's true i would say electric because his fucking performance is since she's very sexual

43:17.680 --> 43:24.960
uh gen like genre of pokemon yeah he's a sex type sexual based sex type you sex tornado duffy

43:27.040 --> 43:33.200
dummy dummy dummy yeah you use evil of cereal sadly you don't know fucking duffy

43:33.200 --> 43:41.280
why don't you get off duffy's jock travis listen we i'm sorry i thought that we had this thing going

43:41.280 --> 43:45.840
and oh yeah but it was coming from a place of like fun and respect for like his work and you

43:45.840 --> 43:50.560
were like oh he's and then i paint a picture of him sadly eating kashi and suddenly it's not okay

43:50.560 --> 43:54.080
well it's disrespectful is what i was saying like what hey trav can i ask you a question

43:54.800 --> 43:59.680
uh-huh what the fuck have you done i watched step by step yeah

43:59.680 --> 44:06.000
yeah always okay you're a fucking you're a fucking monday morning duffy is what you are

44:12.560 --> 44:17.920
this has been our duffy based podcast my brother my brother and me it's not uh always like this

44:17.920 --> 44:22.880
we promise so tell someone about the show it's going to be from now on though from now on it's

44:22.880 --> 44:27.760
all it's very heavy on the duffy uh thank you you say it's not like this but i feel like every third

44:27.760 --> 44:35.600
week we pick like who's a celeb that's kind of falling out of favor oh uh fucking squinto from

44:36.400 --> 44:40.800
from third rock zackary zackary squinto zackary squinto let's pick on that pool for a while

44:41.440 --> 44:44.720
god we're fucking bullies for people who have had like careers that

44:45.920 --> 44:51.520
like all three of us combined have eclipsed us completely and totally i'm just saying it's a

44:51.520 --> 44:55.120
we're getting mean guys we're getting mean we tend to pick people who aren't gonna fight back

44:55.120 --> 45:01.920
that's the thing though fucking duffy will chop us apart duffy will chop you about griffin you

45:01.920 --> 45:05.760
about griffin yeah i got chopped he got chopped apart he's got him for the other two duffy heard

45:05.760 --> 45:09.840
about the shifted he said he chopped his entire body off this is the great paradox of my brother

45:09.840 --> 45:15.840
my brother me though if one of these people were to uh in any way acknowledge our existence

45:15.840 --> 45:21.760
oh forget about they'd be the king of the podcast i would actually just cede my shares to patrick

45:21.760 --> 45:27.520
duffy he could take over my portion of my brother my brother and me uh this has been our advice
