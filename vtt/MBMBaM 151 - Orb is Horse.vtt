00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:31.840
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:31.840 --> 00:48.240
Welcome, my brother, my brother and me. An advice show for the modern era,

00:48.240 --> 01:05.200
and it's the most magical day of the year for us horse aficionados. It's Kentucky Derby Day.

01:18.400 --> 01:20.960
What they call a acid magnet.

01:23.440 --> 01:26.000
The way the mint leaves, you got to filter them out with your teeth.

01:26.720 --> 01:30.800
Actually hate that. That's why I can't drink juleps. You want to work while you drink?

01:31.680 --> 01:37.920
I'm hoping I can get through the entire race without my action winding down because I'm TikTok.

01:39.600 --> 01:44.160
That's good. A good joke tip for everybody is if you name what you're referencing when you

01:44.160 --> 01:48.880
reference it. Yeah, it's comedy 101. That's what they taught us at comedy school before we could

01:48.880 --> 01:55.360
do this podcast. I wanted to tell you guys that I was looking at the horses, and there's one that

01:55.360 --> 02:00.080
I wanted to point out to you specifically, and it is my favorite name of a horse that is running in

02:00.080 --> 02:08.560
the Kentucky Derby, and here it is. Are you ready for it? Yeah. Orb. You know orb one. I am orb.

02:08.560 --> 02:15.440
Orb one the Kentucky Derby. Well of course because he has the maximum amount of space,

02:15.440 --> 02:21.920
the maximum efficiency of space used in a geometric object. Well he also has the most

02:21.920 --> 02:27.600
streamlined name. Right. You know everybody else has like those longs like you know like a Stephen's

02:27.600 --> 02:36.480
left shoe or something you know and it's just orb. Yeah. What if orb was a sentient globe that

02:36.480 --> 02:43.440
insisted he was a horse? I am orb. I am a horse like your earth horses. You must admit me to the

02:43.440 --> 02:49.200
race. I am horse. You are not horse. I am horse. Do not pay attention to how my horse legs don't

02:49.200 --> 03:01.680
touch the ground. I am a hover horse. I am horse. Please inter oats into my oat deposit slot.

03:01.680 --> 03:13.280
I am horse. I am not an orb. I am named orb. Provide me one metric cube of sweet glycerin,

03:13.280 --> 03:21.760
and I shall tell your fortune. And also win your primitive horse race. Also I need a jockey.

03:21.760 --> 03:30.160
If you know of any jockeys, I do need one please. One with preferably a long, a really good wingspan

03:30.160 --> 03:37.520
I'm going to need because I'm spherical and 20 feet in diameter. You might need to paint him with

03:37.520 --> 03:44.800
some kind of glue. I must. Ironic I know. I must win your horse, your earth horse race so I may

03:44.800 --> 03:53.760
make love to your earth horse women. Did you guys say your names? Because mine's just. Orb is a very

03:53.760 --> 04:06.000
sexual being. I come from the advanced future of 5024. Everyone is a geometric shape and everyone

04:06.000 --> 04:15.680
loves to party. Please find me a horse that I will not crush to death. And make sure she's down.

04:15.680 --> 04:23.600
Make sure she's down to clown with a sex ball. Because orb is also only about consensual sex.

04:24.800 --> 04:31.920
Orb knows that real men take no for an answer. Travis. Uh huh. You want to say your name?

04:31.920 --> 04:39.520
I'm Travis. I'm Griffin. Were there any other hit? It's because I watched part of the derby

04:40.480 --> 04:44.320
yesterday and I don't remember seeing anything that really. Usually you'll get a.

04:44.320 --> 04:53.440
Well my favorite part was when cube just sat there. Fucking cube. That's a terrible horse.

04:54.880 --> 05:06.400
Cube bad. Yes cube you are bad. Cube not go good. Cube need a push. Horse other horse pull cube?

05:06.400 --> 05:11.360
No. No. Let's help people. What do you think? Okay. I guess we can do that. I'm ready to help.

05:11.360 --> 05:18.720
Uh last week I asked a close friend girlfriend of a friend. Oh Jesus. You can do this. Cube bad at reading.

05:18.720 --> 05:26.880
Cube bad. Yes cube is bad. Last week I asked a close girlfriend of a year and a half out on a date.

05:26.880 --> 05:32.880
I'm a dude bt dubs. She said no. Meanwhile in the week since my rejection I have developed feelings

05:32.880 --> 05:39.120
for her best friend. Oops. My question is this. Is it too soon to pursue a relationship with her

05:39.120 --> 05:45.440
bestie? And that's betwixt in Bristol. I love starting off the episode with with these easy lobs.

05:45.440 --> 05:54.720
This easy lob uh no. Definitely. Whoa hold on Justin. Of course it's too soon. Too soon for what?

05:55.360 --> 06:00.320
Here's here's why. She turned him down. Let me convince you. Who's feelings is he worried about? Let me convince you.

06:00.320 --> 06:06.240
It's not about feelings. It's about. Nothing's about feelings. No it's not about feelings. Cube doesn't have feelings.

06:06.240 --> 06:13.440
It's about like if okay so you ask out her friend. She says no and then you ask her out. It doesn't

06:13.440 --> 06:19.360
look good. It makes you look insincere is my worry. It makes you look like you're going well

06:19.360 --> 06:24.160
I'm just gonna keep asking everyone out till they say yes. I was gonna I was gonna ask if you think

06:24.160 --> 06:28.560
her friend knows that she asked her out but like of course she does. Yeah that's that's I think that's

06:28.560 --> 06:34.320
the problem. I think you come across as just like oh okay not you. Well what about you? And that that's

06:34.320 --> 06:39.920
not a good way to start a relationship. Gosh you know that's a weird uh I'm not I'm not familiar

06:39.920 --> 06:45.200
with that sort of like shift happening. Nobody's ever turned Justin down for a day. It's never

06:45.200 --> 06:53.040
happened. God no. I've never been to well a dozen times but like not like it hasn't like seriously

06:53.040 --> 07:00.880
that hasn't happened once. It's happened many many more times. Many once. Many once's that

07:00.880 --> 07:08.160
have made. A baker's dozen of once's. Yeah it's true. It's once I get this baby weight off I'm

07:08.160 --> 07:14.480
gonna be out there though. I'm gonna be you watch. Oof um I think I think I think you got a point

07:14.480 --> 07:20.000
Trav. I think that this person is not going to be able to divorce the fact that you literally just

07:20.000 --> 07:25.440
asked out their best friend. Like it's it's just it's probably not going to go well. Also you need

07:25.440 --> 07:32.640
to take a long look in that deep dark truthful mirror and figure out did you just meet this

07:32.640 --> 07:37.520
best friend and that's why you develop feelings for her or was it the person that you wanted turned

07:37.520 --> 07:43.360
you down and so like maybe if they accuse you of just wanting sloppy seconds maybe they're not too

07:43.360 --> 07:48.000
far off base if you got a no from somebody and immediately look to your right and we're like

07:48.000 --> 07:54.160
well you then. But okay there is an unless. Isn't that contrary to sort of what we tell people

07:54.160 --> 08:03.760
who put too much emphasis on asking someone out on a date like doesn't that sort of um. He didn't

08:03.760 --> 08:08.560
say that though he said he developed feelings for that person which is like I don't know it seems

08:08.560 --> 08:16.560
like a weird thing to do literally in the week since her friend turns you down like yeah it

08:16.560 --> 08:25.280
yeah it really does seem the unless. What's the unless? Unless she also has feelings for you and

08:25.280 --> 08:30.240
you've you know like the whole thing with the best friend was. See that is what I was like and you

08:30.240 --> 08:38.080
just met her. Yeah when I when I read the question I envisioned sort of like a um her friend in the

08:38.080 --> 08:43.280
glasses was there the entire time helping you to write love notes and then you didn't see

08:43.280 --> 08:48.000
what was right in front of you. But the thing is the only person that could answer that is you.

08:48.000 --> 08:52.320
You think the only person who could answer that is me? Travis how would I have any insight into

08:52.320 --> 08:59.520
this? No Justin no Justin the the royal you. The royal you or also capital y o u. Orb could

08:59.520 --> 09:04.960
probably shed some light on the situation. All things go for it. No this really is some

09:04.960 --> 09:10.480
Midsummer Night's Dream shit this is some I think what this person needs to do is get both of these

09:10.480 --> 09:16.320
women together. Go into the forest get a little pixie juice up in their eyes. Right. And then

09:17.040 --> 09:21.440
one of them will turn into a goat and then. Have you seen Midsummer Night's Dream? It's been a

09:21.440 --> 09:26.800
while. Yes I've seen the fucking yeah Travis I saw the Shakespeare production that you guys did.

09:26.800 --> 09:29.920
Of course I did it was a special day for me. Anyway one of you turns into a goat

09:31.440 --> 09:38.320
a ghost haunts you and then. There's Stanley Tucci watch out. But it's like a modern remake

09:38.320 --> 09:46.640
so like it's got that sort of Boz Luhrmann touch to it. The original was a remake by Boz Luhrmann.

09:47.600 --> 09:50.400
Him and Billy Shakespeare were best friends I don't know if you guys knew that.

09:51.840 --> 09:58.720
Boz Luhrmann is 50,000 years old. He's clean living. Clean living. Clean clean living and

09:58.720 --> 10:03.840
regularly just expelling his artistic juices that helps him to decompress and continue to live.

10:03.840 --> 10:11.200
Yeah. You guys want a yahoo? Yeah please. This yahoo was sent in by Marina Baker. Thank you Marina

10:11.200 --> 10:15.040
we really should have done this at the beginning of the show. It's from yahoo interview user 123

10:15.040 --> 10:21.360
who asks my mom got me a pony but I didn't want one. I already told her before a million times

10:21.360 --> 10:25.280
that I don't want a pony. I've never wanted a pony and I don't know why some girls are so obsessed

10:25.280 --> 10:29.840
with the thought of having them and even then only little kids like ponies. I'm 13 for fuck's sake.

10:29.840 --> 10:36.240
It doesn't say fuck. I could have gotten so many other things for the amount of money she spent on

10:36.240 --> 10:41.280
that effing pony. It's just because she wanted a pony as a kid so it's her present for herself.

10:41.280 --> 10:46.960
Wow what a fucking great birthday. It's boring and I don't know what to do with it. Even a real

10:46.960 --> 10:51.920
horse would have been better but still a goddamn waste of time and money. How do I get her to bring

10:51.920 --> 11:00.080
that piece of s back? I don't want it. F. Does she know that like a pony will become horse?

11:00.080 --> 11:07.280
Given infinite amount of time and oats horse do pony do become horse. Right. Pony be horse.

11:10.400 --> 11:17.520
Ponies be horses. That was actually one of my professors in college. Dr. Ponies be horses.

11:17.520 --> 11:28.320
Um man I what kind of lack of imagination does this does this what do I even do with this what

11:28.320 --> 11:34.640
do I do with this you can do anything with it dress him up take him to sheriff take him into

11:34.640 --> 11:41.520
the woods and go on an adventure with him reenact the first scene from walking dead yeah well not

11:41.520 --> 11:48.160
the part one okay not that you know that you could pretend like you're um like a kentucky lawman

11:48.960 --> 11:54.560
yeah yeah you can play little justified dress him like a horse and dress him like a dog and then

11:54.560 --> 11:59.520
walk him in the park that just really fuck with people just really mess with people also like

12:00.080 --> 12:04.800
okay from a functional standpoint it we i think we've covered the fact that there's infinite

12:04.800 --> 12:09.680
things you can do with a small horse hopefully we've did with this vertical slice of course

12:09.680 --> 12:16.320
possibilities we've demonstrated that but i think of it also as a status symbol here's what you do

12:16.320 --> 12:20.800
you call your friends over and say check out this fucking small horse i got you got one of your

12:20.800 --> 12:24.560
friends over like i got a new xbox game and they're like is that a horse in your backyard

12:24.560 --> 12:30.320
like oh yeah yeah yeah but check this out yeah check out my tony hawk jump is that do they still

12:30.320 --> 12:36.240
make tony hawk no tony hawk's just there her mom buys her a lot of shit sure you bought me a young

12:36.240 --> 12:42.400
tony hawk i hate it it's boring and i don't know it'll never be able to do the 900 it will someday

12:42.400 --> 12:50.240
it's some kid shit just feed it some oats i can't believe that even i i don't got place for a horse

12:50.240 --> 12:56.960
in my house it would just eat up the herb garden um but i would still be kind of psyched to have

12:56.960 --> 13:02.160
one you know what i mean now a horse does seem like one of those things that i would be psyched

13:02.160 --> 13:07.200
to have for like a week and then the reality of the situation would sink in and i'd be like oh

13:08.320 --> 13:15.280
i can't do i don't know where to keep this aren't there places there are places like people run

13:15.280 --> 13:21.360
places to put horses right nope oh no no they haven't invented that yet no too bad that's a

13:21.360 --> 13:25.840
good idea you should kick start that thank you you should kick start it can you think of really

13:25.840 --> 13:32.880
quick off the top of your head what you would call it uh horse homes no horse homes horse hook

13:33.440 --> 13:40.800
hoof in and hook in and it's i nn right exactly i'm not sure mine was better i'm not sure business

13:40.800 --> 13:50.720
like that would be stable trev oh christ see what we did i did see it it's you can't unsee it now

13:50.720 --> 14:01.840
this arrow in the fedex logo i usually i like to stay away from derogative terms that people use

14:01.840 --> 14:07.520
for women but i'm gonna have to bust it out in this instance because this this young lady is

14:07.520 --> 14:12.800
being a real fussy hussy oh man don't see any other way around it can you call it out like i

14:12.800 --> 14:19.440
can see it i guess she is being kind of a fussy hussy what kind of person when given a horse by

14:19.440 --> 14:25.760
their parents no matter what age you are goes oh fuck you mom no i get i get it this mom's pulling

14:25.760 --> 14:32.320
this shit all the time she buys her like a uh the the lynda ronstadt record that she didn't get

14:32.320 --> 14:38.320
there's a signed david cassidy poster exactly exactly and she's not thinking about how the fact

14:38.320 --> 14:44.800
that she wants she wants like backstage passes to see neo or drake she did you know what this seems

14:44.800 --> 14:54.160
like i bet you that this situation could really be mended with a little freaky friday magic oh man

14:54.160 --> 14:58.080
but then what if the mom's like no this is great that's what i'm saying i don't want to switch back

14:58.080 --> 15:05.840
freaky friday magic it this this girl is obviously she she hates her childish things she she's 13 for

15:05.840 --> 15:12.480
fuck's sake you know what i mean she wants to be if she was 41 all the better and the mom would be

15:12.480 --> 15:21.440
like cool i'll take your kid body yeah now that i'm 32 i can attest to the fact that any freaky

15:21.440 --> 15:27.280
friday situation that i was in would not culminate with me trying to find a gypsy to reverse the

15:27.280 --> 15:31.840
spell it would culminate in me buying a bus ticket and getting the hell away from whatever could

15:31.840 --> 15:36.560
reverse this because oh my god i have it back again whatever this was i have the gift the inner

15:36.560 --> 15:43.040
the gift the inner the life the vibrance trapped in the 42 year old body going everything hurts

15:43.040 --> 15:48.080
and i gotta pee all the time and i'm sad for no reason and the adult and the kid body being like

15:48.080 --> 15:57.520
fuck y'all and i'm out i'm gonna go burn a truck down or something i'm so vibrant and full of life

15:57.520 --> 16:03.200
and the the kid in the adult body is like why am i gleaning satisfaction from a clean house

16:03.200 --> 16:11.120
what has happened to me good night sleep you say yes please that sounds fantastic i gotta turn in

16:13.120 --> 16:19.520
i'll take your fucking pony i'll take your fucking pony you're ungrateful you're angry

16:19.520 --> 16:23.680
are there any yahoo answers people volunteering to take the pony off their hands because that's

16:23.680 --> 16:31.360
what someone on yahoo answers really needs is pony access poor uh morbert altison says poor pony

16:31.360 --> 16:35.760
frown face i'm sure it doesn't feel that way about you try being friends with it

16:38.320 --> 16:44.240
you don't think it's for one moment that the horse goes i wish you would just come out here what you

16:44.240 --> 16:49.520
think that pony rolls up day one and the little girl's like you are a waste of money that pony's

16:49.520 --> 16:55.760
not gonna be like well fuck you too then you realize i'm fucking majestic right right like

16:55.760 --> 17:02.480
i'm the i'm god's most majestic creature and yes my some my fee was a little exorbitant

17:03.440 --> 17:07.360
but you you know what i mean you just gotta spend money to make ponies you can't make it

17:07.360 --> 17:14.960
on without breaking a few ponies exactly i can't imagine that like a horse that isn't gonna get

17:14.960 --> 17:21.520
ridden all the time isn't kind of jazzed about that because the horse will still get fed oats

17:21.520 --> 17:26.800
and that's all horses care about so the horse can keep living its life and it's like if there

17:26.800 --> 17:31.920
was a such a thing as a sentient backpack full of concrete that i had to wear from time to time

17:31.920 --> 17:38.240
i would not want to be buzzed with it i would not have it look into in my charcoal dead eyes

17:38.240 --> 17:43.840
and my four beautiful powerful legs and and if it looked at me and didn't think like oh i'm gonna

17:43.840 --> 17:49.280
climb on your back and be really heavy and try to let you try to break your spirit like break you

17:49.280 --> 17:54.640
break you that's the terminology people use for horses you know yeah break him yeah like um i

17:54.640 --> 18:00.240
think the pony's gonna like him from afar one of the yahoo answers users said uh tell your mom

18:00.240 --> 18:07.440
quick you don't want it and you want her to take it back can you imagine that pony store like seeing

18:07.440 --> 18:12.640
her walk up with the pony and she's like yeah she wanted to return it and they're like a non-starter

18:12.640 --> 18:17.600
she wants she wants to she want i don't under i don't even understand what you're saying this

18:17.600 --> 18:23.360
child didn't want the pony we don't have hey dale do we have a return policy we don't we never we

18:23.360 --> 18:30.960
never pinned one because this is this is fucking unthinkable let me call hq no okay i called pony

18:30.960 --> 18:36.560
hq this has never happened this is literally the first time i guess you can have your money back

18:36.560 --> 18:44.480
but it's it's used now we're just gonna shoot it it's already formed the bond with one that's

18:44.480 --> 18:49.040
imprinted like we can't give it to someone else she's just gonna keep showing up in your backyard

18:49.040 --> 18:54.080
right and especially when your daughter has her life threatened because the pony has a life debt

18:54.080 --> 19:00.000
after your daughter so of course she's going to be there when she's in danger right oh god no i

19:00.000 --> 19:05.600
think you can reverse a pony imprint i think if i went up to this pony with a teaspoon of sugar

19:05.600 --> 19:11.680
you'd be like oh you're my i guess i'm yours now oh peanut butter life life life that's on you

19:11.680 --> 19:19.200
you i'm a sophomore in college and i'm not having any fun because i have no friends i have the

19:19.200 --> 19:24.960
opportunity to transfer to a school where i already know people the problem is all my credits

19:24.960 --> 19:29.520
won't transfer if i stay where i am i will be able to graduate in a year but if i leave i have to stay

19:29.520 --> 19:34.880
two more years do you guys think i should go and have fun or stay and graduate early friendless in

19:34.880 --> 19:40.960
philly friendless in philly wait please stop don't please please don't graduate college please yeah

19:40.960 --> 19:46.960
you gotta transfer you gotta actually just keep transferring just transfer as many times as you

19:46.960 --> 19:54.080
can van wilder just don't leave please don't leave college please here's the thing i didn't learn

19:54.080 --> 20:02.560
shit in college i didn't sorry dad but i didn't but what i did learn is how to how to fucking

20:02.560 --> 20:09.200
party you know what i mean that's that's real that's legit those life experiences that's not

20:09.200 --> 20:15.360
just van wilder movie magic it's legit and it happens and you gotta be a part of it hey i wanna

20:15.360 --> 20:22.000
uh i wanna offer you a secondary theory maybe just something to keep in mind uh when you go

20:22.000 --> 20:28.000
to your new school because you have to go to a new school trust me please don't ever leave college

20:28.560 --> 20:31.920
uh but i would say that to someone in elementary school or middle school or high school either and

20:31.920 --> 20:36.720
i don't think those are great life choices either to try to stay in those but there you go um i

20:36.720 --> 20:43.440
think you scissors teach gotta stick around another year well two plus two equals four

20:43.440 --> 20:51.440
no problem day one got it what you got what else you got uh i i um it sounds to me if unless my

20:51.440 --> 20:57.120
math is off that you are talking about how you're going to graduate college in three years i would

20:57.680 --> 21:03.440
posit the theory that maybe you might be having more fun and have more friends if you weren't

21:03.440 --> 21:09.920
taking like an insane course load like because it sounds like you're trying to jam a lot of college

21:09.920 --> 21:14.480
into three years oh i see what you're saying am i doing the math wrong they said they're a sophomore

21:14.480 --> 21:19.680
they're going to graduate in a year like yeah i wouldn't think you'd have much time for friends

21:19.680 --> 21:22.720
really it's not like you're saying you're going to be there for five or six years you're going

21:22.720 --> 21:27.040
to be there like the normal four yeah i mean that's normal if you're going for you know like

21:27.040 --> 21:33.200
a normal bachelor's yeah degree yeah if you if you didn't do it in four years then you're not

21:33.200 --> 21:38.160
you're abnormal is it travis is basically saying you're an idiot monster creep if you did listen

21:38.160 --> 21:43.200
normal is such a flexible term right well let's just let's just raise our hands let's just do a

21:43.200 --> 21:48.320
really quick round the well because i'm i i know for certain but it's just you know it's just for

21:48.320 --> 21:54.480
the radio audience that everybody on the podcast did it did it in four so um just just getting that

21:54.480 --> 22:00.560
fact out there and just putting it out there for everybody well well well you know i think shorter

22:00.560 --> 22:10.000
than four is weird but longer than four i feel like that is not an uncommon situation that people

22:10.000 --> 22:17.920
find themselves in when they fail oh you mean like yeah i'm sorry of course justin i i god how silly

22:17.920 --> 22:23.440
of me uh yeah if you go back for like your post-grad for like your master yeah yeah yeah

22:23.440 --> 22:32.240
you know sometimes sometimes you end up in college for five years and you're not even sure about why

22:32.240 --> 22:36.320
like because you took a year off to like really find oh yeah yeah or maybe you did like a you

22:36.320 --> 22:42.240
know an apprenticeship somewhere i guess it's maybe okay what if you did take a year off

22:42.240 --> 22:45.600
but you kind of burst it out through several afternoons

22:45.600 --> 22:54.880
that's over the course of three years i took a year off let's yeah let's go with that that

22:54.880 --> 22:59.920
sounds good that sounds real uh yeah i was in college for five years because i failed

22:59.920 --> 23:05.040
spanish i don't really want to delve too deep into that i don't care can you speak spanish now

23:06.720 --> 23:11.760
see which is the grade you got in the class the second

23:11.760 --> 23:21.360
year i actually this i i don't know if i've told this particular anecdote before but i walked in

23:21.920 --> 23:28.160
to my fourth like the fourth spanish class and i had not done well in any of my spanish classes

23:28.160 --> 23:32.640
and i had to have this to graduate because of some sort of you know effort to make story

23:32.640 --> 23:38.880
students more multicultural uh and i i walked in the fourth class and the man spoke nothing

23:38.880 --> 23:46.320
but spanish and he would make homework assignments in spanish so of course i didn't do them i don't

23:46.320 --> 23:54.000
speak spanish right so i failed it and then i had i retook a uh a spanish class it was more like

23:54.640 --> 24:00.560
culture and that worked out a lot better yeah you had to learn how to make microwave nachos

24:00.560 --> 24:07.280

that we've come up with i mean it is you're right can we talk about what fanny time can we set up

27:11.840 --> 27:19.760
the time used to save you 20 at extreme restraints.com your home for a paddle that says slut on it

27:20.320 --> 27:26.160
and many other adult super toys no sorry i messed that up it's a super store for adult toys the tall

27:26.160 --> 27:31.760
the toys themselves i mean some are super but they are not supernatural uh although you would

27:31.760 --> 27:36.160
have to have some supernatural holes to get some of these things into you it's a super store for

27:36.160 --> 27:43.760
super toys for super people supernatural holes is the porn spoof of the tv show supernatural which

27:43.760 --> 27:51.840
is not the most creative title it's really lazy actually supernatural fucking supernatural holes

27:51.840 --> 27:56.960
is actually the slash fig for supernatural and the film holes have you guys seen batman sex

27:57.840 --> 28:03.520
it's a batman porn spoof but it's just batman having sex with people i don't i don't really get

experiences it's got everything you need to make your fucking super super special they have no one

28:16.560 --> 28:22.320

as extreme restraints.com uh and and you should go there and get just try something out broaden your

28:28.480 --> 28:36.800
horizons but we're gonna need to give you a new code god damn it because apparently our code fanny

30:55.200 --> 31:00.320
on his life including his relationships his career and his incredibly popular podcast which

31:00.320 --> 31:06.400

ben 1999 you've come to the right place have you can we talk can we talk about this in a purely

34:55.600 --> 35:00.960
clinical sense so that we don't get you i so we don't totally duck out the remainder of our

35:00.960 --> 35:06.720
audience there's a real answer to this okay there is there's a real scrotum the scrotum

35:06.720 --> 35:13.120
is the body's thermostat it's an amazing it's an amazing invention i'm glad somebody invented the

35:13.120 --> 35:17.920
scrotum because we would have been in a real a real god verse into the other guy's room just

35:17.920 --> 35:23.600
like i figured it out dave cracked it hey god i hate to bother you because i know you're busy

35:23.600 --> 35:30.400
my balls suck right now can you can you can you can you maybe tweak the schematic a little bit

35:31.200 --> 35:34.720
maybe let me see what i can do maybe get a little temperature control up in here i don't i don't

35:34.720 --> 35:38.720
want to like i'm thank you for the life and the love and the good times and the livestock

35:39.280 --> 35:45.360
they're just hanging but they're just hanging there and they are just freely affected by

35:45.360 --> 35:52.640
temperature and changes barometric it all is bad but anytime the scrotum the scrotums are like an

35:52.640 --> 35:57.680
overprotective mom at the slightest sense of danger she's like whoa hold on hold on wait

35:57.680 --> 36:03.920
it's a little chilly let me bundle you let me hold you close come here come here let me just

36:03.920 --> 36:10.240
get you got dinners ready in the pubis you know people didn't have scrotums when we were first

36:10.240 --> 36:19.440
made god didn't actually invent scrotums until the year seven in the year seven god invented

36:19.440 --> 36:27.200
he looked down upon his creation and said this will not do i have i have i'm gonna retcon this

36:27.200 --> 36:33.600
so no one ever knows but uh oh all that stuff all that stuff in the bible about the scrotum

36:33.600 --> 36:38.320
mistakes i need you to i need you to get out the white out strike that please strike that strike

36:38.320 --> 36:44.240
that that was actually there's actually three time periods there's ad there's bc and then there's bs

36:44.240 --> 36:50.640
mm-hmm do you guys think that god okay so god's omnipotent right yes do you think that god has

36:50.640 --> 36:56.880
the ability to like yeah maybe god does make mistakes but after he does him he's like ah

36:57.440 --> 37:05.200
ah me damn it i gotta go back and uh make a make the scrotums and but he like retcons right so he

37:05.200 --> 37:10.400
goes back to adam and eve and he's like listen i'm gonna have to set this up for you right now

37:10.400 --> 37:16.800
let me see your stuff real quick just for a second just get a leaf and turn it into a okay check it

37:16.800 --> 37:22.400
out you're set i'm gonna go back to the present and see how this is affected things because i

37:22.400 --> 37:29.200
bet it's like a really big change um you seem a lot more active now that there's a projection

37:29.200 --> 37:34.880
around those people people don't just sit in corners with their hands cupping their testicles

37:34.880 --> 37:42.400
oh which i imagine is a lot like the oud from uh from dr hair that's what we were before scrotum

37:43.680 --> 37:50.400
um this guy has phrased this question in an uh extremely unorthodox manner

37:51.520 --> 37:58.400
meaning on yahoo answers well yes but also what is a normal day like asking what a normal day is

37:58.400 --> 38:04.720
is implies that there are diaries involved well you don't want to ask your doctor about

38:04.720 --> 38:07.520
like what's it supposed to be like on the worst day of your scrotum's life

38:09.440 --> 38:16.080
i guess that's true what's a great day for you what's like the best day for the scrotum for me

38:16.080 --> 38:20.240
there's this one day where i just like sat around in the hot tub all day and really just kept my

38:20.240 --> 38:25.120
legs spread really wide open and didn't do anything for me in middle school a great day

38:25.120 --> 38:34.480
for my testicles was not being barraged upon there there was a a i'll call it a trend it was a it was

38:34.480 --> 38:43.520
a trending hashtag at my middle school for uh young women uh to just kick the boys as hard as

38:43.520 --> 38:49.840
they possibly could in the balls as with as much force as the end i mean women develop earlier

38:49.840 --> 38:58.240
than men so their kick strength is like magnitudes stronger than ours uh and so bad was this so bad

38:58.240 --> 39:04.240
was this uh this trend that they had to make like a loudspeaker announcer saying like hey everyone

39:06.320 --> 39:13.040
can you stop fucking kicking them in the balls as hard as you possibly can middle school when

39:13.040 --> 39:20.400
people talk about privilege uh i that's one of the things they forget you know oh yeah there's a

39:20.400 --> 39:25.520
there what about your privilege maybe check your privilege teenage girls and stop kicking

39:26.160 --> 39:33.280
uh men in the balls maybe do that and we can maybe start building some bridges here right help whenever

39:33.280 --> 39:39.520
someone talks about something embarrassing with me i turn bright red i'm learning this at age 23

39:39.520 --> 39:45.040
after spending years trying to develop a poker face is there a uh a way to stop this hue change

39:46.080 --> 39:50.560
alternatively is this a skill i can use to my advantage and that's from um uh they've

39:50.560 --> 39:58.400
used the uh they've used the uh hexadecimal code for red here i believe i'm not a computer programmer

39:58.400 --> 40:06.320
but uh oh wait so are you are you asking how to stop being embarrassed or how to stop physically

40:06.320 --> 40:14.160
showing it like i don't think they want to turn red like i think that they are it's like the poker

40:14.160 --> 40:18.240
face you know what i mean like they don't want to be red when they're embarrassed because they want

40:18.240 --> 40:24.000
to try to lie and say that they're not embarrassed you know what's an affectation no one uses

40:24.000 --> 40:29.760
everybody has like top hats or like you know everybody has those everybody everybody has

40:29.760 --> 40:35.680
a bolo tie you're saying what about a neutral mask i don't know what that means a neutral mask

40:35.680 --> 40:41.600
it's like the plain white mask that has no facial expression oh that's all that a murderer would

40:41.600 --> 40:47.840
wear yeah like a terrifying scary mask okay well are you travis somehow telling me that whatever

40:48.880 --> 40:55.440
uh uh social issues this person aims to fix by not having their face turned bright red could

40:55.440 --> 41:03.520
somehow be ameliorated in any way by wearing a murderer mask is that okay so what is okay so

41:03.520 --> 41:13.360
picture this world poker tour champion i cannot even allow you this theoretical diversion you

41:13.360 --> 41:18.640
can't wear reflective sunglasses but you can wear full face murder masks i feel like it's a really

41:18.640 --> 41:22.960
good poi but it's like well i'm gonna lay this hand down so they don't kill me later yeah i bet

41:22.960 --> 41:30.240
a dollar everybody folds please don't fucking stab us to death i bet one dollar and this knife

41:30.240 --> 41:36.080
just gonna put it up here and put it over my cards i have a pair of knives stab stab stab stab

41:36.080 --> 41:44.400
stab that's actually the plot of rounders too that they just one time i have a johnny choo

41:44.400 --> 41:50.880
i've got a mask i've got a straight edge knife that you are now being killed with by me

41:52.400 --> 41:59.440
that was that poker the poker poker you would have to kill i feel like you would

41:59.440 --> 42:05.600
to cement that i feel like you would have to kill one person at a poker table and then after that

42:05.600 --> 42:11.840
well yeah jussie you're not murdering hands you're not you're not murdering sweet pockets

42:11.840 --> 42:18.160
you know what i mean that's what they call it when you win a pot and poke sweet pockets uh-huh

42:18.160 --> 42:23.120
like you win one and then that guy who wears his glasses upside down is like oh sweet pocket

42:23.120 --> 42:27.520
all right thank you like all sane people my favorite poker player is devil fish

42:27.520 --> 42:33.920
oh man and he said that he got that name by playing against the the triad gangs

42:34.720 --> 42:41.920
they called him the devil fish and i am just now at 32 years old here on this sunday morning

42:41.920 --> 42:48.560
realizing that that story was probably bullshit it did not occur to me until this exact moment

42:48.560 --> 42:54.480
thinking about devil fish that he probably did not get that name from triad gangs he probably

42:54.480 --> 42:59.600
just got it from his uncle danny or something hard pill to swallow i guess but yeah but in

42:59.600 --> 43:04.720
reality i have no idea why you turn red what are we what are we fucking scientists here yeah

43:04.720 --> 43:11.120
i don't know science bros get really tan leather yourself up and no one will ever see tan mom

43:11.120 --> 43:17.680
that's a suggestion you can make it's the worst suggestion maybe go in blackface okay that will

43:18.400 --> 43:22.800
that won't be okay the red thing won't be a problem anymore so you'll have that going for

43:22.800 --> 43:27.680
look we fixed your problem like some sort of demented genie we've corrected

43:29.360 --> 43:34.960
corrected your problem but at what cost you know what you wish for

43:36.480 --> 43:42.160
forever blackface you could probably get rid of a lot of social problems with blackface i mean

43:42.160 --> 43:47.600
really i don't know how to talk to strangers well blackface will fix that blackface should fix it

43:47.600 --> 43:51.760
yeah they're gonna know just what to say to you hey fuck you what are you doing with that makeup

43:51.760 --> 43:59.520
you piece of shit i talked to me thanks brothers thanks guys if i ask this girl too soon will she

43:59.520 --> 44:04.160
think it's weird well no she'll think it's weird because you're in blackface and there's your

44:04.160 --> 44:13.520
opener hi i can't help but notice you saw hi i can't help but notice that my face is super racist

44:13.520 --> 44:20.160
you don't have a drink can i get you something i live in a small college town i'm 31 years old

44:20.160 --> 44:25.360
when i drive to my house which is close to the college campus i see some very beautiful girls

44:25.360 --> 44:31.120
walking on the sidewalks what if any is the appropriate method of stopping to talk to the

44:31.120 --> 44:36.960
girls oh my god i've attempted the classy could you give me directions to your heart not doesn't

44:36.960 --> 44:43.680
seem to work so my bim bam any advice would be appreciated that's from pickup policy in pennsylvania

44:43.680 --> 44:55.600
dude can they just go to class can you just let them learn can you just let them go and break the

44:55.600 --> 45:01.520
glass ceiling and learn and become the future business leaders of america without you fucking

45:01.520 --> 45:10.400
wolf whistling out your camaro please please if you want to meet college girls i have a suggestion

45:10.400 --> 45:17.360
excuse me pardon me sorry college women i have a suggestion for you go to college go to college

45:17.360 --> 45:26.240
it's the only man this question bums me out there is no can either of you brainstorm right now and

45:26.240 --> 45:33.360
give me a situation where somebody yelling at you from their car may either stranger danger or a

45:33.360 --> 45:38.720
trusted associate is a good thing because even when i'm like driving and i see a friend in their

45:38.720 --> 45:42.560
car and they roll down their window to talk to me all i can think about is when that light turns

45:42.560 --> 45:47.680
green i hope we're at a organic stopping point in the conversation because i'm just going to

45:47.680 --> 45:55.200
speed off is there any situation where it's okay no there's like i can't even come up with a joke

45:55.200 --> 46:00.320
answer please don't ever do that if you drive past someone and you hear someone yell at you

46:00.320 --> 46:06.320
yeah as they're driving past it does not matter what they say that all of a sudden you are in the

46:06.320 --> 46:13.040
most unpleasant experience let's air out let's air out our dirty laundry okay we used to do this a

46:13.040 --> 46:20.640
lot okay we used to live next to a park where that had a big walking path right next to the road

46:21.520 --> 46:28.800
so we would yell at people as we drove by when we were high school college age

46:28.800 --> 46:35.920
right but we would yell compliments at them right like hey cool jeans

46:38.080 --> 46:43.920
and it's a smart top is the nothing sexually charged nothing that was not our seat no no

46:43.920 --> 46:48.240
it's not like that like yell things like you're making great time yeah yeah this is your best

46:48.240 --> 46:54.880
lap ever keep it healthy but we knew and still the facial reactions from the people were like

46:54.880 --> 46:59.920
you yelled nice cans you know it's always like what fuck you because people just they're gonna

46:59.920 --> 47:03.760
react that way because you're yelling at them you're yelling at them and you're in a car it's

47:03.760 --> 47:09.600
like they're everybody's worst nightmare sentient car i also would say i would rather have someone

47:09.600 --> 47:15.440
yell at me as they drive by then like pull up to the curb and slide to a stop and right so

47:15.440 --> 47:21.040
that's talk to me that's a that's a horse of a different color entirely and i can't it's never

47:21.040 --> 47:28.720
happened to me obviously every every every muscle and bone in your body is devoted to sending the

47:28.720 --> 47:33.600
the visual signal that you were unapproachable even when griffin wears his sweet short shorts

47:33.600 --> 47:38.880
no one's ever pulled out to the side of the right you want to wear champion pants nobody pulls up

47:39.840 --> 47:45.440
there's never been a crossroads-esque scenario that has unfolded organically to me nobody's

47:45.440 --> 47:49.680
even asked for directions because i always look lost i always have my phone up people just assume

47:49.680 --> 47:56.240
i'm google mapping wherever i am um it's not happened to me so but i don't want the whole

47:56.240 --> 48:02.560
podcast to become about that i've lived a good life full life i regret nothing i regret absolutely

48:02.560 --> 48:10.160
nothing but i like if i was if the shoes were reversed the problem would be super uncomfortable

48:10.160 --> 48:19.040
shoes are designed to go on a very specific way but don't hit on women outside of cars

48:19.600 --> 48:25.680
you still can't you relationships are not available through drive-through this is the exact

48:25.680 --> 48:29.920
same uh that you know what this reminds you it's like the same thing with the bank teller question

48:29.920 --> 48:35.840
right can i hit on uh women who are working at the bank as i drive through and the answer is no

48:35.840 --> 48:42.240
no like you cannot pick up anybody you can't ask someone out on a date if you have like

48:44.160 --> 48:49.520
an immediate convenient means of egress like that's cheating yeah and everybody knows it's

48:49.520 --> 48:54.960
also symbolically like symbolism there is very scary because it's saying like get in i'm gonna

48:54.960 --> 49:00.160
take you away it's really frightening like it's a very intimidating position to try to be coming

49:00.160 --> 49:07.200
from it's terrible um especially in this day and age because in every movie or like la law you know

49:07.200 --> 49:13.200
law and order tv show sure someone pulling up in a car and going hey exactly that's exactly so

49:14.080 --> 49:18.800
buffalo bill kind of fucking poisoned the well here for the rest of us because i bet you unless

49:18.800 --> 49:23.200
you know their code word ours was duck tales oh well now that you fucking told everybody

49:23.200 --> 49:31.200
what our kid code word that was our code word if our parents set someone to pick us up they had to

49:31.200 --> 49:37.120
give us a specific code word which i am revealing this now uh i think we're safe i think we're out

49:37.120 --> 49:40.880
of the woods they give us a specific code i'm gonna be honest with you guys if someone rolled

49:40.880 --> 49:46.480
up right now i was like hey your dad's having to pick you up duck tales okay here we go man

49:46.480 --> 49:54.560
wow our parents really went to the cryptographer with that one duck tales capital capital d and

49:54.560 --> 50:02.480
the l is a one oh you got it perfect perfect swordfish unhackable yeah let's get in what did

50:02.480 --> 50:06.640
you say your name was i don't think my dad knows anybody with that kind of mustache but you said

50:06.640 --> 50:10.720
duck tales so let's fucking roll let's party you either know my dad or you know all about duck

50:10.720 --> 50:15.280
tails either way we are hanging you know what i love is our parents set that up and then we walked

50:15.280 --> 50:20.560
home from school every day so it was like you created a barrier and then you left the gate open

50:20.560 --> 50:26.400
what i'm saying is that if you are if you are a child predator in the 90s and you know that you

50:26.400 --> 50:32.080
have to hack that password it's got to be like you get you're walking home and you pull up and

50:32.080 --> 50:40.080
you're like hey team and team ice cream got a tail spin muppets muppet babies duck tales yes

50:40.080 --> 50:46.640
like our minds from mars yes yes yes yes yes i would get into an unmarked van in venezuela

50:46.640 --> 50:53.360
if the person opened the door and said duck tails to me senior senior ducktales oh okay

50:53.360 --> 51:01.760
sure no problem are you gonna chop my head off and whoa you did what life really is like a hurricane

51:02.640 --> 51:08.320
okay okay is that something that everybody had my stranger stranger password suggestion

51:08.320 --> 51:12.800
didn't our parents didn't think that came from like gruff mcgruff whatever his name was our

51:12.800 --> 51:24.240
parents the crime wolf take a chomp out of crime bite a criminal literally in west virginia we

51:24.240 --> 51:37.920
couldn't afford the illegal wolf i'm i'm dale the justice bobcat don't don't be a pussy fight crime

51:40.720 --> 51:42.800
that's my slogan get in the car coward

51:46.240 --> 51:51.200
not riding over the strangers just admitting your weakness why don't you start hitting the gym

51:51.200 --> 51:59.120
oh blast your belts and maybe you can take down attackers that candy does look pretty good

52:00.160 --> 52:04.800
why don't you like candy i'm gonna come at you now i'm gonna come at you now and i need you to

52:04.800 --> 52:10.480
flip me like you flip an attack there was what do you do you guys think there was one kid throughout

52:10.480 --> 52:18.480
history that a did go for the candy got the candy and escaped what i'm saying to you is maybe instead

52:18.480 --> 52:24.160
of a always terrible idea to get to go with strangers with candy maybe it's just a really

52:24.160 --> 52:28.160
risky one that you really have to be able to follow through on like what are the house odds

52:28.160 --> 52:35.840
there yes it doesn't there is no candy sweeter than the candy that you snag out of that bear

52:35.840 --> 52:40.480
trap you know you gotta do that like uh that training montage take the pebble from my hand

52:40.480 --> 52:46.000
kind of thing and you got the candy and you're out i think our parent i think we can all agree

52:46.000 --> 52:51.840
that our parents did a bang-up job in every respect of child raising they they succeeded

52:51.840 --> 52:59.360
but i do question the fact that they even had an addendum to the sentence don't get in a car with

52:59.360 --> 53:06.160
