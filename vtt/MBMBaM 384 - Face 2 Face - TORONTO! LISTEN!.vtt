00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:31.120
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:31.120 --> 00:45.120
It's a new craze, and good girls do you want it? Just say, hey I wanna. Just say, hey I wanna.

00:45.120 --> 00:50.880
Begin. Hello everyone and welcome to My Brother, My Brother and Me, an advice show for the modern

00:50.880 --> 01:04.800
era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

01:11.360 --> 01:15.440
And I'm your sweet baby brother and 30 under 30 media luminary, Griffin McElroy.

01:15.440 --> 01:27.840
Just real quick, two super technical things. One, there's a clock on stage that I think

01:27.840 --> 01:32.960
is supposed to be counting down, but it's not moving. Sometimes it feels like time's not moving

01:32.960 --> 01:37.840
while we're doing this show. And two, someone's recording this, right? Like I didn't check this

01:37.840 --> 01:43.680
beforehand, but it's fine. We apparently are going to spend, you can't see this,

01:43.680 --> 01:49.360
we're going to keep up with the theme of things you can't also see. We are staring at two huge

01:49.360 --> 01:55.920
televisions that are just displaying our picture. The ones that were there, remember just a second

01:55.920 --> 02:01.280
ago? We're apparently going to be fucking barreling those for the entire- Don't take that away. No,

02:01.280 --> 02:06.400
don't take it away because it reminds me how damn handsome I am. What a handsome boy. Look at that

02:06.400 --> 02:12.400
hair. Also, I'm going to give you, the audience, pretty much a 100% guarantee this is not the

02:12.400 --> 02:21.280
biggest table we've ever worked with. There is going to be a big spill of our absolute coffee

02:21.280 --> 02:29.440
drinks. I have two coffee drinks. Thank you all for coming here and thank you to PodCon for having

02:29.440 --> 02:42.960
us. With the response of just like a loud exclamation, how's your PodCon going? All right,

02:42.960 --> 02:50.080
now the nays. Who's having a really shitty PodCon? No. Everybody, just tell me your favorite panel

02:50.080 --> 02:56.160
so far at the same time. One, two, three, go. Cool, cool, cool. A lot of people said yours,

02:56.160 --> 03:03.120
which I feel is a cheat. I'm really excited being here surrounded by creators and just realizing

03:03.840 --> 03:10.000
I'm going to start so many new podcasts. Yeah. I'm starting a new one, a collabo,

03:10.000 --> 03:16.000
me and Lauren Swar from Criminal were on a panel earlier today, and we're doing a new true crime

03:16.000 --> 03:23.760
podcast called Ah, Real Murder. It's really good. It's great. It's like we aren't going to do

03:23.760 --> 03:30.400
research at all. Yeah. My theory is that there's been a trillion people who've ever been on earth,

03:30.400 --> 03:35.440
right? Yeah. Law of large numbers, somebody's been murdered in every conceivable way.

03:36.720 --> 03:42.560
I can just talk about there was one dude who got drowned in a bunch of horsey sauce from Arby's,

03:42.560 --> 03:47.840
and it's probably true. Probably true. Yeah. I'm going to start a new one with Kevin Porter

03:47.840 --> 03:55.920
from Gilmore Guys, where we watch and discuss every episode of Entourage and we call it Entourage.

03:57.280 --> 04:03.600
Is there any way I can presubscribe to that? Because here's the thing, maybe it's good.

04:03.600 --> 04:07.760
No. It's not, but what my book presupposes is...

04:10.400 --> 04:16.880
My new thing's a solo project. It's about the pest and it's called Save the Pest for Last,

04:16.880 --> 04:22.320
and it's a thrilling docudrama about me. There's a John Leguizamo movie called The Pest.

04:22.320 --> 04:24.720
Sorry. I'm sorry, Griffin. A John Leguizamo vehicle.

04:26.160 --> 04:31.680
It drives right off a cliff. Right off a cliff into a shark tank or something,

04:31.680 --> 04:35.520
and it has a really Buckwild intro. It's not especially funny to talk about on the stage.

04:35.520 --> 04:40.000
And it's not funny to watch. No, this is the problem though. I'm glad we've hit on it,

04:40.000 --> 04:45.520
sort of arrived at it organically. We've been doing a lot more live shows and what we find is

04:45.520 --> 04:52.720
it's hard to sort of sit in, sit out, keep the energy up. And we're just three boring guys.

04:52.720 --> 04:55.040
I mean, we just did Tacoma last night. I know.

04:58.640 --> 05:03.040
I was led to believe that Seattle was Tacoma's bitter enemy, so I'm so happy that you could

05:03.040 --> 05:09.040
celebrate them. It's hard to keep the energy up. We don't have pyrotechnics or anything,

05:09.040 --> 05:13.600
so we have been sort of obsessed with this audio file that we found.

05:13.600 --> 05:18.000
It's not the best. We wouldn't do that. Not the best. Because we love you, damn it.

05:18.000 --> 05:23.680
It's not the best. It's 45 minutes of Paul Stanley stage banter.

05:23.680 --> 05:25.760
You know Paul Stanley from Kiss? From Kiss.

05:25.760 --> 05:31.520
He's the one with the star. Yeah. So rather than us try to keep the energy

05:31.520 --> 05:35.920
up and get everybody really excited, we thought we'd just let Paul Stanley do it.

05:36.480 --> 05:41.040
For 45 whole minutes. Welcome to the fucking dungeon.

05:41.040 --> 05:45.360
Not real. It's not real Paul Stanley. He couldn't make it, but we do have this audio file.

05:45.360 --> 05:47.040
He sends his regrets. Yeah.

05:47.600 --> 05:53.760
Just one thing you should, for the next couple of minutes, you should pretend you're in Toronto.

05:53.760 --> 05:56.000
That will really help. It'll really hide the effect.

05:56.000 --> 06:01.920
Also pretend like you're playing the Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time and Navi is floating

06:01.920 --> 06:04.960
over your shoulder for reasons that will become instantly apparent.

06:04.960 --> 06:08.560
Also pretend like you know anything about the titles of Kiss songs.

06:08.560 --> 06:10.240
Yeah. So you know what he's building up to.

06:10.240 --> 06:13.680
He's going to be building up to some things that you're not going to be aware of where he's headed.

06:13.680 --> 06:15.600
So just sort of hang in there. All right.

06:15.600 --> 06:18.880
So let this just absorb this and let it get you so psyched.

06:19.440 --> 06:23.200
This is 45 minutes of Paul Stan- Well, two minutes of Paul Stanley stage.

06:23.200 --> 06:24.960
Two minutes of 45 minutes of Paul Stanley.

06:25.920 --> 06:35.360
All right! Toronto! You feel good! All right then, listen.

06:35.360 --> 06:39.920
You know, we may be under clear blue skies, but you know, it's getting a little

06:39.920 --> 06:43.680
cool out tonight, but that ain't going to stop us because if we try hard enough,

06:43.680 --> 06:48.880
we're going to get this place. I said we're going to get this place.

06:50.320 --> 06:51.280
How did that help?

06:55.040 --> 06:56.720
Can we get it a little louder? All right, listen.

06:58.080 --> 07:01.120
I want to know if we got any people here tonight that like to get high.

07:01.120 --> 07:06.640
You got any people tonight that are high?

07:10.720 --> 07:12.000
All right then, listen.

07:13.040 --> 07:17.840
You know, every once in a while, we like to get a little wasted.

07:17.840 --> 07:20.240
We like to take a taste of alcohol.

07:23.120 --> 07:29.040
And I tell you, when we won't get going, we ain't going to be drinking no Southern Comfort.

07:29.040 --> 07:36.240
No, no. No, we ain't going to be drinking no tequila.

07:40.960 --> 07:47.200
Because I tell you, when we won't get going, you know there's only one drink that gets us moving.

07:49.200 --> 07:52.640
There's probably people who want the alcohol. He's building to it.

07:52.640 --> 07:59.360
I can't hear you. All right, Toronto.

08:02.720 --> 08:10.080
Listen, listen. You know, it wasn't too long ago we was here and I'll tell you,

08:10.080 --> 08:14.000
every time we come here, damn it, it just gets better and better.

08:15.760 --> 08:17.360
You people are dynamite.

08:19.040 --> 08:19.520
That's it.

08:19.520 --> 08:23.120
It goes on like that for another 43 minutes.

08:23.120 --> 08:26.800
And we've listened to that like five times in the last 48 hours.

08:26.800 --> 08:29.280
Listen! Listen! Toronto!

08:29.280 --> 08:33.440
You gotta get the Daeku nut and throw it at stuff.

08:36.160 --> 08:39.360
Does anybody know what fucking alcohol song he's building to?

08:41.440 --> 08:44.800
Old gin? Old gin? Wolf gin?

08:44.800 --> 08:46.480
I get drunk on old gin.

08:46.480 --> 08:49.040
It's really gross. Listen!

08:49.040 --> 08:52.320
I like the way the dust particles settle in it.

08:52.320 --> 08:55.040
You gotta find the master sword.

08:55.040 --> 08:56.080
Toronto!

08:56.080 --> 08:57.040
Toronto!

08:57.040 --> 08:58.560
Give it a try for us.

08:58.560 --> 08:59.600
Hey, let's do a podcast.

08:59.600 --> 09:05.680
You can't just play 45 minutes of Paul Stanley audio and call it a podcast.

09:05.680 --> 09:07.840
Or can you? Hello, PodCon.

09:07.840 --> 09:11.280
My new podcast, uh, so thank you to Paul.

09:11.280 --> 09:14.480
Stand'em. That's what I would call it.

09:14.480 --> 09:15.280
Yeah, it's not bad.

09:15.280 --> 09:18.320
Yeah, it's not bad. It's not a good reaction, though.

09:18.320 --> 09:21.840
We take your questions and turn them alchemy-like into wisdom.

09:21.840 --> 09:24.240
And so, thank you.

09:25.200 --> 09:26.080
So we're gonna do that now.

09:26.960 --> 09:28.560
Lights are so bright. They're very bright lights.

09:28.560 --> 09:29.040
So bright.

09:29.040 --> 09:30.800
Hey, let's take it down. No, don't take it down.

09:30.800 --> 09:31.840
I like it.

09:31.840 --> 09:34.640
I am traveling from Salt Lake to Seattle,

09:34.640 --> 09:38.560
and I'm wondering how the heck I'm supposed to take my skateboard on an airplane.

09:39.920 --> 09:41.600
I have no idea.

09:41.600 --> 09:45.440
And I don't want to leave it behind because it is my main form of transportation.

09:46.080 --> 09:48.800
That's from skater boy on the salt dare.

09:49.520 --> 09:51.920
At that point, isn't, isn't the airplane your...

09:53.600 --> 09:56.160
No, he's skitching, skitching the whole way here.

09:56.800 --> 09:58.160
Please watch out for the jets.

09:58.160 --> 10:00.240
They are not conducive to skitching.

10:01.600 --> 10:04.880
I mean, you got a skateboard onto the tarmac.

10:04.880 --> 10:05.600
Absolutely.

10:05.600 --> 10:08.960
Up the luggage thing, onto the wing,

10:08.960 --> 10:11.040
transfer over the chassis of the plane.

10:11.040 --> 10:12.000
Into jail.

10:12.000 --> 10:15.920
Into jail, out of jail, back onto the wing,

10:15.920 --> 10:17.840
smash through the window of the airplane.

10:18.800 --> 10:20.320
The flight will be grounded.

10:21.040 --> 10:23.360
They need that window so bad.

10:23.360 --> 10:25.440
It's important for the vacuum.

10:25.440 --> 10:28.320
The vacuum. I don't understand much about airplane technology,

10:28.320 --> 10:30.080
but I think the vacuum is quite important.

10:30.880 --> 10:35.440
I have seen people bring, like, really weird shit on an airplane.

10:35.440 --> 10:36.000
Yes.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.800
Can't you just, can't you just bring...

10:38.800 --> 10:39.360
Yeah, it's not...

10:39.360 --> 10:41.360
It's so funny.

10:42.960 --> 10:45.280
It's a very funny thing to say, Travis.

10:45.280 --> 10:48.240
Is this your first episode of My Brother, My Brother, and Me?

10:50.880 --> 10:51.440
So...

10:55.520 --> 10:56.960
The hard part is TSA.

10:57.760 --> 11:00.400
Cause they're going to be like, do you have anything dangerous?

11:00.400 --> 11:02.880
And you're going to be like, I should fucking say I do.

11:02.880 --> 11:04.320
I should fucking say I do.

11:06.320 --> 11:09.040
Do you have any paper you need shredded?

11:09.040 --> 11:11.520
And then you do a flip.

11:11.520 --> 11:14.400
You do a kickflip and then you shred somebody's passport

11:14.960 --> 11:17.200
with how hard your kickflip is.

11:17.200 --> 11:18.960
They say, do you have anything electric in there?

11:18.960 --> 11:20.320
Yeah, I guess.

11:20.320 --> 11:21.040
Yeah, it is.

11:21.040 --> 11:22.480
It is electrifying.

11:22.480 --> 11:23.040
Oh, okay.

11:23.520 --> 11:24.320
You have any liquids?

11:24.320 --> 11:24.720
Yes.

11:24.720 --> 11:28.480
The piss you're going to piss when you see me do my cool skateboard tricks.

11:28.480 --> 11:31.280
If you get your, it's not conventional or cheap,

11:31.280 --> 11:34.320
but if you get your passport printed on a skateboard,

11:36.960 --> 11:39.360
they are going to have to let you board with it.

11:40.080 --> 11:42.720
Or get your passport photo taken with your skateboard in it.

11:42.720 --> 11:45.200
And so you show up, you're there, you're looking at your ticket.

11:45.200 --> 11:45.920
They're like, this isn't you.

11:45.920 --> 11:46.960
And you're like, oh, hold on.

11:50.080 --> 11:51.600
Here's what you're going to have to do.

11:51.600 --> 11:55.040
You could wear it as a hat in the passport photo and be like,

11:55.040 --> 11:57.040
no, it's a medicinal skateboard.

11:57.040 --> 11:58.800
It's a medicinal skateboard hat.

11:59.760 --> 12:00.800
I need it for life.

12:00.800 --> 12:04.160
You're going to have to break your skateboard down into its component parts

12:04.160 --> 12:06.720
and disguise them as other parts of your luggage.

12:06.720 --> 12:09.600
Like use the wheels on your suitcase, right?

12:09.600 --> 12:10.160
Yes.

12:10.160 --> 12:13.120
And put the skateboard board,

12:15.280 --> 12:17.600
the board part on the back of the suitcase,

12:17.600 --> 12:19.920
and then put the trucks in the suitcase.

12:19.920 --> 12:20.480
Trucks?

12:20.480 --> 12:20.960
Trucks.

12:20.960 --> 12:21.200
The?

12:21.840 --> 12:22.480
Trucks, yeah.

12:22.480 --> 12:23.200
Axles?

12:23.200 --> 12:23.600
Yes.

12:23.600 --> 12:24.800
I don't know.

12:24.800 --> 12:27.280
I'm pretty in touch with skateboard culture.

12:27.280 --> 12:31.680
I don't know how the security line at the TSA works,

12:31.680 --> 12:35.040
but I think one of the main things they hate is components.

12:36.000 --> 12:40.240
Any sort of component-based thing they're like not wild about.

12:40.240 --> 12:41.920
Even if you promise them, no, no, no.

12:42.640 --> 12:43.600
It's cool.

12:43.600 --> 12:45.360
I'm going to build a skateboard.

12:47.040 --> 12:48.160
I still don't think that's good.

12:48.160 --> 12:49.440
I know how this looks.

12:49.440 --> 12:51.920
I know how this looks, what with all the components,

12:51.920 --> 12:54.080
but it is for a skateboard.

12:54.640 --> 12:56.000
How about a Yahoo?

12:58.560 --> 12:59.920
If you've never listened to our show,

12:59.920 --> 13:02.640
sometimes we make fun of people on Yahoo Answers.

13:02.640 --> 13:03.280
No.

13:03.280 --> 13:04.320
We make fun with them.

13:04.320 --> 13:05.040
We make fun with them.

13:05.040 --> 13:05.760
We help them out.

13:05.760 --> 13:08.160
Are there any people who actually just show hands?

13:08.160 --> 13:10.480
Any people who have never listened to our show before they're here?

13:10.480 --> 13:11.280
Anybody?

13:11.280 --> 13:12.320
Hey, all right.

13:12.320 --> 13:12.800
All right.

13:12.800 --> 13:14.000
All right.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.360
Toronto.

13:15.360 --> 13:16.560
New people.

13:16.560 --> 13:20.320
Every time I come to podcast, it just gets better and better.

13:20.320 --> 13:23.360
Better! You people are dynamite!

13:23.360 --> 13:26.720
The podcast is not usually us shrieking Paul Stanley quotes.

13:28.400 --> 13:31.360
This Yahoo is sent in by the delivery man himself, Seth Carlson.

13:31.360 --> 13:31.600
Thank you.

13:34.720 --> 13:36.960
It's Yahoo Answers user Carol who asks,

13:39.040 --> 13:42.000
should spaghetti be way shorter?

13:45.120 --> 13:47.280
I'm not talking about that macaroni.

13:47.280 --> 13:49.040
I'm not talking about that penne.

13:49.040 --> 13:52.400
I'm talking about that short spaghetti.

13:53.360 --> 13:56.480
I really love word choice and Yahoo's is always my favorite part

13:56.480 --> 14:00.880
because the question is not, could spaghetti be shorter?

14:00.880 --> 14:01.760
But should it?

14:01.760 --> 14:02.400
Ethically.

14:03.120 --> 14:04.160
Would it be okay?

14:04.960 --> 14:06.960
Morally, is spaghetti too long?

14:06.960 --> 14:10.880
I know a lot of times I'm sucking one of those good, good nudes up

14:10.880 --> 14:11.760
and I get about-

14:11.760 --> 14:12.320
Whoa!

14:12.320 --> 14:13.200
And it's not a good-

14:13.200 --> 14:14.080
No, okay.

14:14.080 --> 14:15.040
Yikes!

14:15.040 --> 14:17.520
In retrospect, it's not a good truncation.

14:17.520 --> 14:19.280
And we've all learned a lot here tonight.

14:20.240 --> 14:21.840
Maybe dulls.

14:21.840 --> 14:22.560
Dulls?

14:22.560 --> 14:23.440
No, just noodles.

14:23.440 --> 14:24.400
Dulls, noodles.

14:24.400 --> 14:25.280
Noodles?

14:25.280 --> 14:26.240
Noodles, noodles.

14:26.240 --> 14:27.280
You know what I'll say?

14:27.280 --> 14:28.320
Spaghetti noodles.

14:28.320 --> 14:30.160
Sometimes I'm consuming a spaghetti noodle

14:30.160 --> 14:33.120
and get two thirds of the way through and I'm like, ugh, I get it.

14:33.120 --> 14:33.680
You're talking-

14:33.680 --> 14:34.160
You're saying-

14:35.280 --> 14:35.840
Take a break.

14:37.840 --> 14:40.880
Get to that point and I'm like, ugh, I'm over it.

14:40.880 --> 14:41.840
You're saying that we need-

14:41.840 --> 14:44.160
What if you get full at that exact moment?

14:44.160 --> 14:44.400
Oh, yeah.

14:44.400 --> 14:48.160
Yeah, I don't want the last third of this noodle.

14:48.160 --> 14:49.200
Too much.

14:49.200 --> 14:50.320
Too much for me.

14:50.320 --> 14:53.120
You're saying way shorter is way too short.

14:53.120 --> 14:56.400
You want a master's finesse on these noodles.

14:56.400 --> 15:00.480
A keen eye taking maybe 8% of the noodle off just a little-

15:00.480 --> 15:02.240
I would like bespoke noodles.

15:02.240 --> 15:02.800
Yes.

15:02.800 --> 15:05.600
I would like someone who measures the inside of my mouth

15:05.600 --> 15:07.840
and then makes noodles accordingly.

15:07.840 --> 15:10.640
I want someone, I want a waiter to come to my table

15:10.640 --> 15:12.640
with what appears to be a mop

15:12.640 --> 15:14.800
full of spaghettis of varying lengths

15:14.800 --> 15:18.480
and then ask me very personal questions about my upbringing.

15:19.040 --> 15:20.480
Select the right noodle.

15:20.480 --> 15:23.360
Measure your mouth with a special ruler.

15:23.360 --> 15:25.840
And then maybe come around with a golden pair of scissors

15:25.840 --> 15:28.160
that they discard immediately after you-

15:28.160 --> 15:28.960
Throw it right away.

15:28.960 --> 15:30.720
And it's just like, that's too much noodle.

15:30.720 --> 15:31.760
And they just take care of it-

15:31.760 --> 15:33.840
Ooh, they could cut it right in front of your mouth.

15:33.840 --> 15:34.720
Right in front of your mouth.

15:34.720 --> 15:36.560
You're going like, that's it, win.

15:37.280 --> 15:38.160
Yes, of course, sir.

15:38.160 --> 15:42.160
Thank you, sir. Okay, what if they just come to the table

15:42.160 --> 15:45.200
with a bathtub full of spaghetti

15:45.200 --> 15:48.480
and they stand there and just let you keep sucking it up

15:48.480 --> 15:50.000
until you're full and then-

15:50.000 --> 15:51.520
And hidden inside is a flag.

15:57.520 --> 15:59.360
You're going to space camp, my friend.

16:01.040 --> 16:02.800
I feel like if spaghetti was way shorter,

16:02.800 --> 16:04.800
you would have fork issues.

16:04.800 --> 16:06.720
This would now become a spoon food.

16:06.720 --> 16:07.200
Yeah.

16:07.200 --> 16:08.960
Well, not only that, how unsatisfying would it be

16:08.960 --> 16:09.440
if you were like-

16:11.440 --> 16:13.760
You like the noodly hanging,

16:13.760 --> 16:16.080
the Cthulhu effect of the noodles.

16:16.800 --> 16:19.520
There's a certain sound wave that happens

16:19.520 --> 16:21.040
as you inhale the noodle.

16:21.040 --> 16:21.440
That's like-

16:22.640 --> 16:23.120
Right, that's one of my-

16:23.120 --> 16:24.720
Yeah, also my vape noise.

16:26.320 --> 16:28.480
Is there spaghetti flavored vape?

16:28.480 --> 16:28.960
Yep.

16:30.560 --> 16:32.160
If we're going to make them shorter,

16:32.160 --> 16:34.320
we should probably make them thicker as well.

16:34.880 --> 16:35.840
Oh, God.

16:35.840 --> 16:36.800
I want-

16:36.800 --> 16:38.080
How thick are we talking?

16:38.080 --> 16:39.680
What's the diameter juice?

16:39.680 --> 16:45.120
Like baked bean can size spaghetti noodles

16:45.120 --> 16:48.720
that are about this long and this big around.

16:48.720 --> 16:50.000
I want it to be like,

16:50.000 --> 16:52.480
man, I want some spaghetti in four hours.

16:52.480 --> 16:53.920
I better start braising this.

16:55.600 --> 16:59.680
So like a puck of spaghetti.

16:59.680 --> 17:00.400
Exactly.

17:00.400 --> 17:01.520
How do you want it?

17:01.520 --> 17:02.880
It only comes al dente.

17:04.400 --> 17:06.000
It can't get very cooked.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.680
That's great. You can just lay it on its side

17:07.680 --> 17:10.720
and just take a big bite of it from the top.

17:11.360 --> 17:11.680
I like-

17:11.680 --> 17:12.640
You're laughing,

17:12.640 --> 17:14.560
but there's a dark part of you-

17:14.560 --> 17:15.360
You would.

17:15.360 --> 17:15.680
You do.

17:15.680 --> 17:16.640
You, you.

17:16.640 --> 17:17.520
There's a part of you that's like,

17:17.520 --> 17:19.120
put a sear on it, maybe.

17:19.120 --> 17:19.600
I don't know.

17:20.480 --> 17:22.080
I need a nasty noodle can.

17:22.080 --> 17:23.680
Yeah, I eat a nasty can of noodle.

17:23.680 --> 17:25.680
Where does the sauce go?

17:25.680 --> 17:26.880
It's just sauce flavored.

17:26.880 --> 17:27.440
If you put it-

17:27.440 --> 17:28.160
Oh, God.

17:29.840 --> 17:31.360
This is not a food of opulence.

17:31.360 --> 17:33.440
This is a food of convenience that's for you.

17:33.440 --> 17:34.800
It's obviously inside.

17:34.800 --> 17:36.160
Oh.

17:36.160 --> 17:37.760
Yeah, like a secret pocket.

17:37.760 --> 17:39.360
If you cut it, it just sort of-

17:39.360 --> 17:40.160
Oh, gotta be careful now,

17:40.160 --> 17:42.320
because now we're talking about a big ravioli.

17:42.320 --> 17:42.880
No, no, no.

17:43.760 --> 17:44.800
Holy shit.

17:45.440 --> 17:46.080
No.

17:46.080 --> 17:47.520
It's all connected.

17:47.520 --> 17:47.760
Okay.

17:48.320 --> 17:50.480
All pastas, kind of the same, yeah.

17:50.480 --> 17:51.920
Okay, time out, time out.

17:52.880 --> 17:55.120
Quick ravioli check, if anybody's ever-

17:55.120 --> 17:56.800
Anyone here a ravioli?

17:56.800 --> 17:59.120
You have to tell us there's entrapment.

17:59.120 --> 18:02.320
You, you know that classically,

18:02.320 --> 18:06.080
this, the marinara is not stuffed inside the ravioli.

18:06.080 --> 18:07.120
Like a gusher.

18:07.120 --> 18:09.200
Like a savory marinara gusher.

18:09.200 --> 18:10.080
It's not like that.

18:10.080 --> 18:12.240
Oh, no, that's a pizza roll.

18:12.880 --> 18:14.080
Okay, fair.

18:14.080 --> 18:16.240
Why have they never made savory gushers,

18:16.240 --> 18:17.840
now that I'm thinking about it?

18:19.440 --> 18:21.520
Fucking cowards, all of you.

18:22.560 --> 18:23.440
Here's what it should be.

18:23.440 --> 18:25.120
It should be a packet of gushers.

18:25.120 --> 18:27.280
99% of them are sweet.

18:27.920 --> 18:29.440
One is savory.

18:29.440 --> 18:30.400
I gotta be careful though,

18:30.400 --> 18:33.040
I don't want my head to turn into a big ravioli,

18:33.040 --> 18:35.840
like the commercials for gushers.

18:37.600 --> 18:41.440
So, recently at my parents' house,

18:41.440 --> 18:44.880
I found an old trunk full of the bram with dusty puppets.

18:44.880 --> 18:47.200
Hello, we're the dusty puppets!

18:47.200 --> 18:48.720
Hello, Toronto!

18:48.720 --> 18:49.920
Hello, Toronto!

18:50.960 --> 18:54.480
I also found proof that my father was involved

18:56.000 --> 18:57.680
in competitive puppetry.

18:57.680 --> 18:59.200
Okay, hold on.

18:59.200 --> 19:04.400
You find a trunk of dusty puppets,

19:04.400 --> 19:05.920
that speaks for itself.

19:05.920 --> 19:07.760
Oh, my father used puppets.

19:07.760 --> 19:10.800
What is the proof that your dad used to do competitive-

19:10.800 --> 19:11.760
Articles.

19:11.760 --> 19:12.720
In clippings.

19:12.720 --> 19:15.360
The only thing I think is a trophy for competitive puppetry.

19:15.360 --> 19:15.920
A medal.

19:15.920 --> 19:18.560
No, a local teen competes with puppets.

19:18.560 --> 19:19.040
Yeah.

19:19.040 --> 19:23.040
This could have been something we talked about as a family before,

19:23.040 --> 19:24.480
and maybe I just forgot.

19:24.480 --> 19:24.960
No.

19:24.960 --> 19:26.240
You would not have forgotten.

19:26.240 --> 19:28.080
No, you would not have forgotten.

19:28.880 --> 19:29.760
Absolutely not.

19:30.720 --> 19:32.480
I feel like I would have remembered puppets.

19:32.480 --> 19:32.880
Yep.

19:33.680 --> 19:35.600
Either way, this cannot go unaddressed.

19:35.600 --> 19:39.520
When is the best time to bring up that you know about your father's secret past

19:39.520 --> 19:41.040
as a competitive puppeteer?

19:41.600 --> 19:44.960
That's from quote, I know about the puppets in Paris.

19:44.960 --> 19:46.720
Okay, I would like to pose the scenario.

19:46.720 --> 19:48.320
Justin is the dad here, okay?

19:48.320 --> 19:53.760
Okay.

19:53.760 --> 19:57.040
I don't think you want to do that.

19:57.040 --> 20:00.960
His father's a strong man, and he put the puppets away for a reason.

20:00.960 --> 20:04.000
I'm not ready for whatever kind of reaction he's going to have.

20:04.000 --> 20:04.640
Like a cobra.

20:04.640 --> 20:06.960
He competes at a professional level.

20:06.960 --> 20:07.600
Yeah.

20:07.600 --> 20:09.120
What is a puppet competent-

20:09.120 --> 20:11.920
Can we address what competitive puppetry is?

20:11.920 --> 20:13.360
Okay, options.

20:13.360 --> 20:18.400
One, you're trying to knock off the other guy's puppet.

20:18.400 --> 20:20.000
With your puppet or a pre-made?

20:20.000 --> 20:21.200
My puppeting's so hard.

20:21.200 --> 20:25.200
It is non-contact competitive puppeteering.

20:27.600 --> 20:29.200
You scare them very bad with your good-

20:29.760 --> 20:30.240
Yeah.

20:30.240 --> 20:31.200
Okay, option two.

20:32.080 --> 20:36.320
How long can you puppet before someone realizes it's not a real person?

20:37.600 --> 20:38.160
That's it.

20:39.120 --> 20:39.840
Start the clock.

20:39.840 --> 20:40.240
Because when-

20:40.240 --> 20:41.520
Hi, everybody.

20:41.520 --> 20:42.480
Hey, Steve.

20:42.480 --> 20:44.320
How's it going? Just another hard day-

20:44.320 --> 20:45.200
Wait a minute.

20:45.200 --> 20:45.920
Stop the clock.

20:47.200 --> 20:48.000
This guy's felt.

20:49.680 --> 20:50.640
He's got googly eyes.

20:50.640 --> 20:52.640
When Sesame Street came out, nobody knew.

20:52.640 --> 20:55.360
And so reviews of the first episode of Sesame Street was like,

20:55.360 --> 20:57.760
they have the biggest bird I've ever fucking seen.

20:58.960 --> 21:00.160
It talks at everything.

21:00.160 --> 21:04.880
They found a real fucking cryptozoological monster, and it loves cookies.

21:04.880 --> 21:06.240
10 out of 10 stars.

21:06.240 --> 21:07.760
Put it on PBS, Darla.

21:07.760 --> 21:10.480
There's a giant hairy elephant, and it's talking.

21:10.480 --> 21:11.680
He's in a trashcan.

21:11.680 --> 21:13.200
I don't even know what's up.

21:13.200 --> 21:15.760
My one-year-old son loves Sesame Street, though.

21:15.760 --> 21:17.600
That's probably really what it's like for him.

21:19.440 --> 21:20.480
That must be nice.

21:20.480 --> 21:22.480
Love to go back to imagine.

21:22.480 --> 21:23.520
Love to go back.

21:23.520 --> 21:26.400
To have an imagination again.

21:26.400 --> 21:28.880
To believe in hope and goodness.

21:28.880 --> 21:30.320
Competitive puppeteering.

21:32.560 --> 21:34.240
Competitive puppetry of the penis.

21:34.240 --> 21:35.120
Is that anything?

21:36.560 --> 21:38.000
I don't want it to be a thing.

21:38.000 --> 21:38.720
Is that just like,

21:38.720 --> 21:40.640
I don't want it to be a thing.

21:40.640 --> 21:41.360
Is that just like,

21:41.360 --> 21:41.840
Yeah.

21:43.840 --> 21:45.680
Puppetry of the penis does exist.

21:45.680 --> 21:47.440
That's not from my mind's eye.

21:47.440 --> 21:50.320
It was on Showtime late at night when I was a teenager.

21:52.320 --> 21:55.920
Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe I'm competitive.

21:55.920 --> 21:57.280
Puppetry of the penis.

21:57.280 --> 22:00.160
You're using your competitor's penis.

22:00.160 --> 22:01.920
Yes, absolutely.

22:01.920 --> 22:03.680
That's a short match.

22:03.680 --> 22:04.880
Yes, I give.

22:04.880 --> 22:06.000
Mercy, mercy, mercy.

22:06.000 --> 22:06.480
I quit.

22:06.480 --> 22:08.320
All right, and we're ready to say, I'm done.

22:08.320 --> 22:09.280
I'm out.

22:09.280 --> 22:10.080
How about a yahoo?

22:10.960 --> 22:11.600
I have another one.

22:11.600 --> 22:12.000
Wait, hold on.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.840
I think I know what competitive puppetry is.

22:13.840 --> 22:15.040
Oh, good.

22:15.040 --> 22:18.080
Two puppeteers, the same puppet.

22:19.280 --> 22:21.120
And they take turns and it's like,

22:21.120 --> 22:22.720
no, that was, that was what that puppet is.

22:22.720 --> 22:24.880
I thought you meant two hands, one puppet.

22:30.720 --> 22:32.400
And I'm not going to make the cheap joke

22:32.400 --> 22:34.320
that sounds like two hands, one puppet.

22:34.320 --> 22:37.600
Cause that's below us and it's fucking 2017 AD.

22:37.600 --> 22:40.240
The year of our Lord on the Gregorian calendar.

22:40.240 --> 22:40.800
Stop it.

22:42.320 --> 22:44.160
This is from the delivery man, Seth Carlson again.

22:44.160 --> 22:44.720
Thank you, Seth.

22:44.720 --> 22:48.240
It's yahoo answers user, the DS guy who asks,

22:49.120 --> 22:51.040
is a jelly donut a donut?

22:53.440 --> 22:59.840
Now listen, you think you know where this question is going.

22:59.840 --> 23:03.200
I mentioned the donut man to my Sunday school teacher.

23:03.200 --> 23:05.280
So he played his guitar and sang a song.

23:05.280 --> 23:07.920
Life without Jesus is like a donut because there's

23:07.920 --> 23:09.440
a hole in the middle of your heart.

23:10.000 --> 23:11.360
Everyone loves this jam.

23:12.240 --> 23:13.280
You guys know that one, right?

23:13.840 --> 23:17.440
I said, what about donuts without holes?

23:17.440 --> 23:20.720
He played and sang the same song, but with different lyrics.

23:20.720 --> 23:22.960
A donut without a hole is not a donut.

23:24.640 --> 23:27.520
So I said, what about a jelly donut?

23:27.520 --> 23:29.680
He sang the same song with the lyrics.

23:29.680 --> 23:35.360
A jelly donut is not a donut.

23:35.360 --> 23:36.400
So is he right?

23:36.400 --> 23:37.920
Is a jelly donut, not a donut?

23:37.920 --> 23:39.840
Is a donut without a hole, not a donut?

23:39.840 --> 23:41.680
Is a life without Jesus like a donut?

23:41.680 --> 23:43.360
Is there a hole in the middle of your heart?

23:43.360 --> 23:44.800
Jesus wants to fill that hole.

23:48.880 --> 23:54.000
My favorite mental picture of this is the progression

23:54.000 --> 23:57.760
of the Sunday school teacher whose face plays the first song.

23:57.760 --> 24:00.400
But what about a donut without a donut hole?

24:00.400 --> 24:02.080
Well, that's ridiculous.

24:02.080 --> 24:03.440
Okay, second song.

24:03.440 --> 24:04.960
And then third, what about a jelly donut?

24:06.320 --> 24:09.120
Jelly donut is not a donut.

24:09.120 --> 24:14.960
The, this Sunday school teacher looked in the mirror that morning

24:14.960 --> 24:16.800
before class and said to himself,

24:18.000 --> 24:19.920
I am out of things I know about Jesus.

24:22.160 --> 24:26.000
I have a Sunday school class today and I've taught them

24:26.000 --> 24:29.520
all the cool things that I learned about Jesus.

24:29.520 --> 24:33.120
All his wanderings and his ways, I have taught them all.

24:33.120 --> 24:34.960
I should try to vamp.

24:34.960 --> 24:38.640
I hope someone asks the question that allows me to vamp off of it.

24:38.640 --> 24:39.520
But here's the thing.

24:39.520 --> 24:43.520
If you tell a six-year-old that life without Jesus is like a donut,

24:43.520 --> 24:45.200
how's that six-year-old not like sweet?

24:45.200 --> 24:45.840
Awesome.

24:45.840 --> 24:46.320
Yeah.

24:46.320 --> 24:47.600
Fucking sick, bro.

24:47.600 --> 24:48.400
I love donuts.

24:48.400 --> 24:49.440
Donuts are awesome.

24:49.440 --> 24:51.440
If I remember correctly, the song is literally like,

24:51.440 --> 24:54.240
it's good for a little while, but then like-

24:54.240 --> 24:54.720
No.

24:54.720 --> 24:57.840
Then you hit the center where there's no more donuts.

24:57.840 --> 24:59.200
That's not how donuts work.

24:59.200 --> 25:00.480
I've never eaten a donut and be like,

25:01.280 --> 25:02.320
hey, where'd it go?

25:03.440 --> 25:04.240
What the hell?

25:06.080 --> 25:07.840
Why did you do this to me, Jesus?

25:09.680 --> 25:11.760
There's no donut in the middle of the donut.

25:13.200 --> 25:16.320
Do you think that anybody tried to tell that cat like,

25:16.960 --> 25:19.280
I know you think you have something with this track,

25:19.280 --> 25:22.560
but that sounds pretty rad.

25:22.560 --> 25:25.200
I don't think we necessarily want to compare these two things.

25:25.200 --> 25:27.520
Also, long johns are donuts.

25:27.520 --> 25:28.560
They don't have holes.

25:28.560 --> 25:29.920
Is a Danish a donut?

25:29.920 --> 25:31.360
No, it's a Danish, stupid.

25:32.480 --> 25:33.120
Now wait.

25:33.760 --> 25:34.160
Okay.

25:35.120 --> 25:37.200
Is a jelly donut just a Danish?

25:37.200 --> 25:40.560
Jelly donut's just a closed over Danish that hasn't been circumcised.

25:43.920 --> 25:44.320
Okay.

25:47.280 --> 25:48.640
Well, think about it.

25:48.640 --> 25:49.520
I'd rather not.

25:50.240 --> 25:51.280
No, I get it.

25:51.280 --> 25:52.560
You brisk that jelly donut.

25:52.560 --> 25:54.400
Now we're working Danish territory.

25:55.680 --> 25:56.640
We're in Denmark.

26:00.880 --> 26:02.160
No, hold on.

26:02.160 --> 26:03.280
Justin's moved the mic.

26:04.400 --> 26:04.960
Oh, shit.

26:07.920 --> 26:08.640
Wait, hold on.

26:08.640 --> 26:24.560
The people who raised their hands just looked around so confused.

26:24.560 --> 26:31.440
I come from the land of the ice and snow.

26:31.440 --> 26:39.440
This is a very, very litigious band.

26:39.440 --> 26:40.880
I want a munch.

26:48.880 --> 26:49.200
Hey, everybody.

26:49.200 --> 26:50.160
Welcome to Munch Squad.

26:50.160 --> 26:54.480
It's a podcast within a podcast.

26:54.480 --> 26:59.120
We're so honored to be at PodCon when the McElroy brothers got the invite.

26:59.120 --> 27:01.120
We didn't know if we would also be on the list,

27:01.120 --> 27:06.080
but we begged and pleaded our way in and we're so excited to be with you to share this.

27:06.080 --> 27:09.040
I can see not very well Justin's iPad from this side of the table.

27:09.040 --> 27:13.840
I just saw sort of a brown sort of mass that maybe is sort of...

27:14.400 --> 27:15.360
Don't give it away.

27:15.360 --> 27:15.680
Okay.

27:17.840 --> 27:19.120
Big news, everyone.

27:20.080 --> 27:22.480
Cinnabon against God.

27:24.640 --> 27:25.600
It doesn't say that.

27:25.600 --> 27:27.280
That's me editorializing.

27:27.280 --> 27:28.480
S-I-N-A-B-U-N.

27:28.480 --> 27:28.720
Yeah.

27:29.680 --> 27:30.080
Thank you.

27:30.080 --> 27:30.560
Thank you.

27:30.560 --> 27:33.600
Cinnabon is stuffing a cinnamon roll inside a cookie.

27:36.560 --> 27:36.880
Wait.

27:38.000 --> 27:39.520
There's no space inside a cookie.

27:39.520 --> 27:42.000
Unless this cookie is the fucking TARDIS.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.400
I do not understand how this feat is possible.

27:44.400 --> 27:46.320
It's spreading a cinnamon bun.

27:46.880 --> 27:47.200
Cinnamon roll.

27:47.200 --> 27:48.000
Wait, what?

27:48.000 --> 27:48.880
Cinema bun.

27:48.880 --> 27:49.760
Cinema bun.

27:49.760 --> 27:50.800
A cinema bun.

27:50.800 --> 27:52.720
Cinema bun inside a cookie.

27:53.520 --> 27:56.640
They're taking a cookie and they're putting a fucking cinnamon roll inside of it.

27:56.640 --> 27:58.720
That should be the end of the press release.

27:58.720 --> 28:05.120
My favorite thing about Munch Squad is that sometimes in order to justify...

28:05.120 --> 28:06.080
I'll just say it.

28:06.080 --> 28:06.720
Their sin.

28:07.440 --> 28:12.400
They come up with a fake situation that they're solving.

28:12.400 --> 28:15.200
Like, no, you see, it's not a sin against Jesus.

28:16.480 --> 28:17.680
We're solving a problem.

28:17.680 --> 28:20.960
And the fake problem they've invented for this delight...

28:20.960 --> 28:22.480
Not enough diabetes.

28:22.480 --> 28:23.600
Yeah, right.

28:23.600 --> 28:25.440
Is one of my favorites so far.

28:25.440 --> 28:28.480
The days of deciding between a fresh warm cookie

28:28.480 --> 28:31.680
and an ooey gooey Cinnabon cinnamon roll are no more.

28:31.680 --> 28:36.560
These are two different day periods that you eat these foods.

28:36.560 --> 28:40.560
Also, who made both of them at the same time?

28:41.040 --> 28:43.120
Who was like looking at the oven like, what's this?

28:43.120 --> 28:44.320
Oh, we fucked up.

28:44.320 --> 28:45.760
We did two bakings.

28:47.360 --> 28:50.880
In honor of National Cookie Day, Cinnabon will...

28:50.880 --> 28:54.000
I mean, desecrate the idea of a cookie.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.880
It'll slit its throat in front of its family.

28:57.520 --> 29:01.040
Cinnabon will offer the most ingenious treat to date.

29:01.040 --> 29:02.080
The Cookie Bond Bite.

29:03.120 --> 29:07.360
This item takes the beloved chocolate chip cookie to another level.

29:07.360 --> 29:08.480
Hell, pretty bad.

29:09.920 --> 29:11.920
By baking a Bond Bite...

29:11.920 --> 29:13.440
Imagine the, like...

29:13.440 --> 29:14.880
Pretend you're the person creating this

29:14.880 --> 29:16.880
and see if your brain doesn't try to stop you.

29:16.880 --> 29:17.600
It probably will.

29:18.640 --> 29:19.760
It takes the Bond Bite,

29:19.760 --> 29:22.560
the bite-sized version of Cinnabon's world famous cinnamon roll,

29:22.560 --> 29:24.400
inside a chocolate chip cookie.

29:25.680 --> 29:26.000
Where?

29:26.640 --> 29:26.960
Where?

29:28.080 --> 29:28.480
Where?

29:29.040 --> 29:31.600
It will only be available for a limited time,

29:31.600 --> 29:33.840
as will the people who consume it, ironically.

29:37.440 --> 29:40.400
There's no better way to celebrate National Cookie Day

29:40.400 --> 29:42.880
than with the quintessential combination of cookies and milk.

29:42.880 --> 29:44.960
Stop acting like you're fucking honoring the cookie

29:44.960 --> 29:47.040
when you're remixing it and shitting on it.

29:47.040 --> 29:50.640
There's no better way to celebrate your last National Cookie Day.

29:50.640 --> 29:51.600
Huh.

29:51.600 --> 29:55.200
To provide guests with the ultimate dunking experience.

29:55.200 --> 29:57.280
Who dumps a fucking cinnamon roll?

29:59.120 --> 30:01.440
They partnered with Fair Life

30:01.440 --> 30:04.160
to provide a free eight ounce bottle of milk.

30:04.160 --> 30:07.520
Your last one for every Cookie Bite purchase on December 4th.

30:07.520 --> 30:09.280
And we put cookies in it.

30:09.280 --> 30:10.080
Fuck off.

30:10.080 --> 30:10.880
Fuck off.

30:10.880 --> 30:15.200
The nutrient-rich ultra-filtered milk is lactose-free.

30:15.200 --> 30:18.320
It contains 50% more protein, 30% more calcium.

30:18.320 --> 30:18.880
I am.

30:18.880 --> 30:21.600
Wait, and 50% less sugar than regular milk.

30:21.600 --> 30:26.800
Do not care about the nutrients in the milk of the Nightmare Bomb

30:26.800 --> 30:29.440
that I'm shoving down my hate gullet.

30:29.440 --> 30:32.640
That's the worst misdirect I've ever heard.

30:32.640 --> 30:35.440
But the milk is so wicked good for y'all.

30:35.440 --> 30:36.000
Seriously.

30:36.880 --> 30:39.600
The milk's totally gonna cover for the sugar mess.

30:39.600 --> 30:41.120
The milk's like, not fine.

30:41.120 --> 30:41.840
He's with me.

30:44.640 --> 30:48.160
The bad cookie will hide in the milk in your tummy.

30:48.160 --> 30:50.400
Um, there's more.

30:50.400 --> 30:52.960
Sharing a passion for the highest quality ingredients yield...

30:54.640 --> 30:57.040
I don't care if this shit's made out of emeralds.

30:58.480 --> 30:59.120
And gold leaf.

30:59.120 --> 31:02.480
Cinnabon and Fair Life make the perfect pair, just like Milky Cookies.

31:03.200 --> 31:04.720
Let's check in with Jill Thomas,

31:04.720 --> 31:07.520
the Vice President of Global Marketing for Cinnabon.

31:08.720 --> 31:10.240
Free me from this prison.

31:11.040 --> 31:15.520
The Cookie Bomb Bite is one of our yummiest examples of creativity

31:15.520 --> 31:20.400
to come out of the Innovation Kitchen.

31:20.400 --> 31:23.840
Hatred and creativity are different things, Jill.

31:23.840 --> 31:26.560
But they occupy the same part of our awful brain.

31:27.440 --> 31:31.440
The extent to which we despise humanity has never been more full-on.

31:31.440 --> 31:33.040
We've never hurt you more.

31:33.760 --> 31:39.280
The delicious Cookie Bomb Bite joins two extraordinary baked goods

31:39.280 --> 31:46.160
to create an unexpected out-of-this-world flavor combination not to be missed.

31:46.160 --> 31:46.660
How?

31:48.240 --> 31:49.440
Because here's the thing.

31:49.440 --> 31:50.960
Show me a picture of this bad boy.

31:50.960 --> 31:52.800
All I'm picturing is like Saturn,

31:52.800 --> 31:55.600
where there's literally just like a salmon bun thing.

31:55.600 --> 31:57.040
You're not that far off, my man.

31:57.040 --> 31:58.000
I don't know if y'all...

31:58.000 --> 31:58.800
Probably not, right?

31:58.800 --> 32:00.000
But I can try to...

32:05.040 --> 32:05.920
Somebody...

32:05.920 --> 32:07.280
Yeah, I mean, I need it too.

32:07.280 --> 32:08.720
That's what you're all fucking thinking.

32:08.720 --> 32:11.120
You wanted to laugh, but like secretly you're like,

32:11.120 --> 32:13.440
hell yeah, I fucked that up.

32:13.440 --> 32:14.320
No question.

32:14.320 --> 32:15.360
I just, it's...

32:16.160 --> 32:18.240
Do you think after they put this press release out,

32:18.240 --> 32:19.600
somebody leaned in and like,

32:19.600 --> 32:22.480
why didn't we just do like a chocolate chip cinnamon roll?

32:23.040 --> 32:24.640
And they're like, oh, shit.

32:25.840 --> 32:26.320
Damn it.

32:26.320 --> 32:29.760
That's because they were getting into their partnership

32:29.760 --> 32:32.560
with Nashville's Christie Cookie Company,

32:33.200 --> 32:36.560
the brand behind the famous DoubleTree by Hilton Cookie.

32:36.560 --> 32:39.280
We take your favorite hotel cookie and we put it

32:39.280 --> 32:40.400
in a fucking cinnamon roll.

32:40.400 --> 32:41.120
What do we care?

32:41.760 --> 32:43.280
We take your favorite hotel cookie,

32:43.280 --> 32:45.520
put it in your favorite airport cinnamon roll.

32:46.880 --> 32:49.200
Our partnership with Christie Cookie Company

32:49.200 --> 32:51.440
is just one example of our dedication

32:51.440 --> 32:53.600
to supporting premium bakery brands

32:53.600 --> 32:56.880
that offer craveable products on par with Cinnabon.

32:56.880 --> 32:58.240
Are you sure you want to do that, Jill?

32:59.200 --> 33:01.440
You sure you want to wash the throne that hard?

33:01.440 --> 33:06.480
There is one kind of day you can have after eating one of these,

33:06.480 --> 33:07.040
I feel like.

33:07.040 --> 33:09.600
In a way, like maybe it's a relief you eat one of these

33:09.600 --> 33:13.040
and it's like, well, clear my schedule.

33:13.040 --> 33:16.320
Yeah, it transforms your khakis into sweats.

33:16.320 --> 33:19.280
This is a cookie you look at all day and think, not yet.

33:19.280 --> 33:20.000
Not yet.

33:20.000 --> 33:20.480
Not yet.

33:20.480 --> 33:20.800
Not yet.

33:20.800 --> 33:21.120
Not yet.

33:21.120 --> 33:23.680
I still have things to do in this world.

33:25.200 --> 33:26.640
How about another question?

33:26.640 --> 33:27.140
Yup.

33:28.080 --> 33:29.520
I work at a bridal store.

33:29.520 --> 33:30.000
Oops.

33:30.000 --> 33:30.560
Oh, no.

33:30.560 --> 33:31.760
Oh, no.

33:31.760 --> 33:32.720
Questions went away.

33:32.720 --> 33:34.240
I work at a bridal store and have

33:34.240 --> 33:35.920
to work in pretty close proximity

33:35.920 --> 33:37.280
to a lot of our customers.

33:37.280 --> 33:40.160
When I notice that someone smells particularly nice,

33:40.160 --> 33:41.520
it's such a pleasant surprise.

33:41.520 --> 33:43.360
I often find myself complimenting them on it.

33:48.240 --> 33:49.120
It's too late.

33:49.120 --> 33:49.920
It's too late for them.

33:49.920 --> 33:50.720
Next question.

33:50.720 --> 33:51.220
Move on.

33:51.840 --> 33:52.400
They're done.

33:52.400 --> 33:53.760
They fucked up too bad.

33:53.760 --> 33:56.720
The problem is saying, wow, you smell really good.

33:57.440 --> 34:00.240
Sometimes comes off the wrong way.

34:00.240 --> 34:00.960
Are you sure?

34:00.960 --> 34:01.460
What?

34:02.720 --> 34:03.920
Go on.

34:03.920 --> 34:06.880
However, I think saying sorry I'm not trying to be creepy

34:06.880 --> 34:08.400
might actually make it worse.

34:08.400 --> 34:08.900
Yes.

34:09.840 --> 34:10.880
Oh, you don't say.

34:11.760 --> 34:12.880
Both are right.

34:13.440 --> 34:16.720
Should I stop complimenting this aspect of my customers completely

34:16.720 --> 34:18.640
or just stop apologizing for it?

34:18.640 --> 34:21.360
That's from Sorry for Smelling in Nebraska.

34:22.400 --> 34:23.280
Are you here?

34:23.280 --> 34:24.880
I heard so much response.

34:26.080 --> 34:26.800
Yes or no?

34:27.440 --> 34:28.880
And I'll count it down.

34:28.880 --> 34:30.640
Is this acceptable behavior?

34:30.640 --> 34:31.600
Yes or no?

34:31.600 --> 34:32.720
Three, two, one.

34:34.320 --> 34:35.920
So I heard a lot of yes there.

34:35.920 --> 34:37.200
I heard six yeses.

34:37.200 --> 34:38.960
Travis's challenge accepted.

34:38.960 --> 34:41.200
We're going to do round robin and try to say this in a way

34:41.200 --> 34:41.840
that isn't creepy.

34:41.840 --> 34:42.720
No, no, no.

34:42.720 --> 34:43.200
We can do that.

34:43.200 --> 34:43.680
We can do that.

34:43.680 --> 34:47.040
People edit it out and make it sound like a thing, I think.

34:47.040 --> 34:49.200
Some of us have acting degrees.

34:49.200 --> 34:49.700
Okay.

34:50.640 --> 34:52.960
Justin has three quarters of an acting degree.

34:53.600 --> 34:55.200
I have a whole acting degree.

34:55.200 --> 34:59.760
All right, here we go.

34:59.760 --> 35:01.680
That was just me clearing my throat.

35:04.240 --> 35:05.440
I gotta let him get through it.

35:05.440 --> 35:06.480
Just let me get to it.

35:06.480 --> 35:06.980
Yeah.

35:08.400 --> 35:09.680
Your musk.

35:09.680 --> 35:10.180
Okay.

35:11.040 --> 35:11.680
No, okay.

35:11.680 --> 35:12.960
Gotta let him get through it.

35:12.960 --> 35:13.760
Gotta let me get through it.

35:14.400 --> 35:15.600
Because you don't know how it's gonna end.

35:17.200 --> 35:19.360
The fragrance you're exuding.

35:20.000 --> 35:20.560
Right?

35:20.560 --> 35:21.680
No, I'm out.

35:21.680 --> 35:22.240
I quit.

35:22.240 --> 35:22.880
I'm tapping out.

35:22.880 --> 35:24.240
I'm out.

35:24.240 --> 35:25.520
Okay, everybody be quiet.

35:29.760 --> 35:30.400
No.

35:30.400 --> 35:31.120
No?

35:31.120 --> 35:32.320
Your smell.

35:32.320 --> 35:33.840
No, can't start with a sniff.

35:33.840 --> 35:34.720
Okay, let me try it.

35:34.720 --> 35:35.280
Let me try again.

35:35.280 --> 35:35.440
Let me try.

35:35.440 --> 35:36.000
Okay, okay, okay.

35:37.920 --> 35:38.480
No.

35:38.480 --> 35:39.520
Okay, no.

35:39.520 --> 35:40.320
Absolutely not.

35:40.320 --> 35:40.800
Cannot.

35:41.360 --> 35:41.840
Griffin, do you wanna-

35:41.840 --> 35:42.800
Your particles.

35:42.800 --> 35:43.300
All right.

35:44.240 --> 35:45.520
They smell good.

35:45.520 --> 35:46.000
You're done.

35:46.000 --> 35:46.560
It's done.

35:47.760 --> 35:48.720
What if you're just like...

35:48.720 --> 35:52.800
Oh, nice.

35:54.800 --> 35:55.440
No need to-

35:55.440 --> 35:56.400
Okay, let's act it out.

35:56.400 --> 35:56.960
Act it out.

35:56.960 --> 35:57.440
You do it.

35:57.440 --> 36:00.080
I'm leaning down to look at a veil that I like.

36:00.080 --> 36:00.580
Okay.

36:02.960 --> 36:03.520
Oh, nice.

36:06.400 --> 36:07.920
What if I don't do the sniff?

36:07.920 --> 36:09.200
Okay, let's try again.

36:09.200 --> 36:09.700
Okay.

36:10.960 --> 36:12.000
Oh, nice.

36:12.000 --> 36:12.720
What?

36:12.720 --> 36:13.280
What's up?

36:15.280 --> 36:17.680
There's a good smell in here from sniffing.

36:17.680 --> 36:19.120
There's a smell in here from somebody.

36:23.840 --> 36:26.000
Somebody in here smells good.

36:26.000 --> 36:26.720
Live your life with-

36:26.720 --> 36:27.280
Not me.

36:27.280 --> 36:28.080
Not me.

36:28.080 --> 36:29.600
Who else is it?

36:29.600 --> 36:30.480
Is it me?

36:30.480 --> 36:31.520
I guess so.

36:31.520 --> 36:33.440
Or somebody else who was in here before.

36:33.440 --> 36:34.880
That's not weird, is it?

36:34.880 --> 36:35.840
I love you.

36:35.840 --> 36:37.040
I love you too.

36:37.040 --> 36:39.200
That dress is for our wedding now.

36:41.360 --> 36:42.800
I stole your fucking wedding.

36:42.800 --> 36:48.160
Live your life with the confidence of the person willing to claim the good smell is them.

36:48.160 --> 36:49.360
It's me.

36:49.360 --> 36:50.320
It's me.

36:50.320 --> 36:50.960
You got it.

36:50.960 --> 36:57.520
I know if you missed up before going outside, you know you're the one with the good smell.

36:57.520 --> 37:01.040
You always know if you're the one with the smell, no matter what kind of smell it is.

37:01.040 --> 37:02.320
Actually, here's the thing.

37:02.320 --> 37:05.360
I live my life every day afraid that I smell bad and no one's telling me.

37:05.360 --> 37:06.640
That's just like, I leave her room out.

37:06.640 --> 37:07.280
Jesus.

37:07.280 --> 37:08.000
I know.

37:08.000 --> 37:09.520
I have a lot of weird anxiety.

37:09.520 --> 37:10.080
A lot.

37:10.080 --> 37:14.880
And so for someone to look at me and be like, hey, straight up, you smell good.

37:14.880 --> 37:15.680
No.

37:15.680 --> 37:20.640
Still, you said that out loud and even then after you said it, you still realized it's not good.

37:20.640 --> 37:25.120
I think the only way that would actually work is if I traveled back in time to myself and said,

37:25.120 --> 37:27.040
hey, you smell good.

37:27.040 --> 37:33.280
There's no good way really to compliment a stranger about more or less anything, which is fine.

37:33.280 --> 37:36.800
Maybe an anonymous comment card situation.

37:36.800 --> 37:43.200
Everybody should have like a suggestion box that they carry like a fanny pack on their back though.

37:43.200 --> 37:47.680
And so you slip it in there where they're not like, and it's like, totally cool.

37:47.680 --> 37:48.960
The smell is nice.

37:48.960 --> 37:50.560
No, it's still not good.

37:50.560 --> 37:53.280
What about a missed connections web page?

37:53.280 --> 37:54.800
Still not good, Travis.

37:54.800 --> 37:57.920
But then it just says like, you came into my store and you smell good.

37:57.920 --> 37:59.520
And then you'd be like, I think that was me.

37:59.520 --> 38:02.000
Go to them and say, hey, what's your LinkedIn?

38:02.000 --> 38:02.880
And they'll tell you.

38:02.880 --> 38:03.840
You say, okay, good.

38:03.840 --> 38:05.120
You got a good reputation.

38:05.120 --> 38:10.240
Come in your way, keep an eye on, keep an eye on your inbox.

38:10.240 --> 38:14.480
What if there was just a sign over the door that says someone in here smells good?

38:14.480 --> 38:22.240
Then he could just like point to, you could ask them what shampoo.

38:22.240 --> 38:24.640
Ooh, Ooh, Ooh, Ooh, Ooh.

38:24.640 --> 38:26.400
Nevermind I got two y'all.

38:26.400 --> 38:26.880
All right.

38:26.880 --> 38:27.440
I think I've got it.

38:27.440 --> 38:28.000
I think I've got it.

38:28.000 --> 38:29.520
Okay.

38:29.520 --> 38:33.440
They're trying on the dress or veil or whatever.

38:33.440 --> 38:35.280
And you say, what's that smell?

38:35.280 --> 38:38.240
No, no, I can't, you can't.

38:38.240 --> 38:40.480
Especially now when someone's changing clothes.

38:40.480 --> 38:42.080
Yeah, can't, can't do it.

38:42.080 --> 38:44.960
You think they're going to be talking about a butt?

38:44.960 --> 38:47.280
No, you can't.

38:47.280 --> 38:51.040
What's that smell has never been followed with the rest of the sentence cause it's great.

38:51.040 --> 38:52.480
All right, stop, stop.

38:52.480 --> 38:55.040
What's that good smell?

38:55.040 --> 38:58.640
No, no, what's that good smell is fucking bulletproof.

38:58.640 --> 39:00.320
You enlist them in the mystery.

39:00.320 --> 39:03.840
Let us live around together.

39:03.840 --> 39:07.040
And they might say, Oh, I have a scent on, it might be me.

39:07.040 --> 39:10.400
And then you can say like, Oh yeah, I guess that's it, done.

39:10.400 --> 39:17.840
Don't need to drag it out any, what have you, what have you gained?

39:17.840 --> 39:19.360
What have you gained?

39:19.360 --> 39:23.200
This is why can't you smell the smell, think in your head, that's nice.

39:23.200 --> 39:26.080
And then store that positive moment away for yourself.

39:26.080 --> 39:27.840
Even that's kind of funny.

39:27.840 --> 39:37.360
I'm going to save, I'm not going to say anything, but I'm going to save the memory of your great

39:37.360 --> 39:39.360
smell for myself later.

39:39.360 --> 39:43.280
I'm going to enjoy it later.

39:43.280 --> 39:48.560
I think maturity is just a series of starting to say really fucked up things and then thinking

39:48.560 --> 39:49.560
now it's just for me.

39:49.560 --> 39:50.560
Yeah, that one.

39:50.560 --> 39:53.320
That one's staying in the old dome.

39:53.320 --> 39:55.480
Or just not thinking them.

39:55.480 --> 40:01.360
Listen, I wish I had that kind of self control.

40:01.360 --> 40:09.840
Hey everybody, this is Griffin.

40:09.840 --> 40:13.760
Thank you so much for listening to this episode of My Brother and My Brother and Me, our live

40:13.760 --> 40:15.560
show from PodCon.

40:15.560 --> 40:16.560
PodCon was a ton of fun.

40:16.560 --> 40:20.840
If you didn't get a chance to go to it, you missed out on seeing some really great panels

40:20.840 --> 40:22.520
or did you miss out?

40:22.520 --> 40:26.800
Because you can still get a streaming ticket and watch archives of all the stuff that we

40:26.800 --> 40:28.840
talked about there.

40:28.840 --> 40:30.400
Thank you so much to everybody who was there.

40:30.400 --> 40:34.200
You all were very, very cool and it was nice to meet everybody.

40:34.200 --> 40:37.160
Let's talk about some of our sponsors this week so you can get back to listening to the

40:37.160 --> 40:38.160
rest of the episode.

40:38.160 --> 40:40.800
Our first sponsor is NatureBox.

40:40.800 --> 40:42.840
If you're trying to eat better, the holidays are a minefield.

40:42.840 --> 40:46.840
They got chocolates, they got cookies, they got candied canes.

40:46.840 --> 40:50.400
Let NatureBox help you out with snacks that you love that are delicious and better for

40:50.400 --> 40:51.400
you.

That's NatureBox.com slash my brother for 50% off your first order.

41:16.400 --> 41:22.520
One last time, that's NatureBox.com slash my brother.

41:22.520 --> 41:26.360
I also want to tell you all about Harry's because Harry's is the best way to get razors

41:26.360 --> 41:30.560
that you can use on any of your parts that you don't want as much hair on anymore, I

41:30.560 --> 41:31.560
guess.

41:31.560 --> 41:36.120
I have a Harry's razor that I use to shave with and it gets my face as smooth as a seal's

41:36.120 --> 41:37.660
ass.

41:37.660 --> 41:41.880
But anyway, you already know that Harry's is dedicated to making amazing quality products

41:41.880 --> 41:43.640
at a super reasonable price.

41:43.640 --> 41:45.440
But Harry's also makes a great gift.

41:45.440 --> 41:49.200
So this holiday, Harry's is offering custom and limited edition shaving sets.

41:49.200 --> 41:52.920
They come with German engineered five blade cartridges that provide a close comfortable

41:52.920 --> 41:53.920
shave.

41:53.920 --> 41:56.080
They got foaming shave gel that smells amazing.

41:56.080 --> 42:01.520
They have special limited edition winter chrome and emerald green handles and you can personalize

42:01.520 --> 42:02.760
it with engraving.

42:18.200 --> 42:22.600

42:27.240 --> 42:28.960
That's Harry's.com slash my brother.

42:28.960 --> 42:31.480
Got a few Jumbotrons for you as well.

42:31.480 --> 42:33.600
First off, I want to tell you about Toontown Public Works.

42:33.600 --> 42:35.360
It's the hot new podcast.

42:35.360 --> 42:37.560
So much buzz at PodCon.

42:37.560 --> 42:40.880
People are just gabbing, gabbing, gabbing about Toontown Public Works and those people know

42:40.880 --> 42:42.740
about fucking podcasts.

42:42.740 --> 42:46.240
Do you like old cartoons that are wrongfully or rightfully forgotten?

42:46.240 --> 42:48.800
Do you like hearing about the latest in animation news?

42:48.800 --> 42:52.480
Do you like discussions of the socio-political implications of the Three Stooges?

42:52.480 --> 42:58.120
Join HT the raccoon, Casey the dog, and Cirque the cat in Toontown Public Works, a podcast

42:58.120 --> 43:02.320
of three Toons going through shorts that fell in the public domain while giving their thoughts

43:02.320 --> 43:04.680
on the Toons of past, present, and future.

43:04.680 --> 43:05.680
P.S.

43:05.680 --> 43:08.040
Casper isn't a dead kid, but the product of ghost fucking.

43:08.040 --> 43:09.040
Look it up.

43:09.040 --> 43:10.040
I believe I will.

43:10.040 --> 43:13.800
Anyway, go to iTunes, Stitcher, or wherever you get your podcasts and search for Toontown

43:13.800 --> 43:18.480
Public Works or just follow them on Twitter at Toontown Public.

43:18.480 --> 43:19.560
Another Jumbotron here.

43:19.560 --> 43:24.680
For this one, I want you to help out the kids of the Running to Places Theater Company at

43:24.680 --> 43:27.560
bit.ly slash pobuddiesnerfix.

43:27.560 --> 43:30.120
That's a great little URL you've secured there.

43:30.120 --> 43:33.560
Running to Places is a non-profit youth community theater company for teens.

43:33.560 --> 43:36.160
Participation is totally free and it's crazy fun.

43:36.160 --> 43:39.360
My name's Joey and I founded R2P 11 years ago.

43:39.360 --> 43:42.840
I definitely did not get approval from my board to pay for this ad.

43:42.840 --> 43:47.120
Please help me not get fired while helping us keep R2P free for the kiddos by donating

43:47.120 --> 43:52.240
at bit.ly slash pobuddiesnerfix before somebody notices the charge on our card and starts

43:52.240 --> 43:53.420
asking questions.

43:53.420 --> 43:56.480
If we get enough donations to cover the cost of the ad, am I good?

43:56.480 --> 43:57.480
I think so.

43:57.480 --> 44:01.360
Please help this person keep their job and please help keep this really cool sounding

44:01.360 --> 44:02.360
theater company alive.

44:02.360 --> 44:07.360
This sounds like a really great way to spend some of your bucks this holiday season.

44:07.360 --> 44:12.840
Speaking of, there's also the MBMBAM Angels Project where you can help out people in Huntington

44:12.840 --> 44:15.600
who are in need this holiday season.

44:15.600 --> 44:18.300
Our local paper puts out a list called Empty Stockings.

44:18.300 --> 44:26.400
It's just a list of some of the most heartbreaking things that people are asking for this holiday

44:26.400 --> 44:28.420
season.

44:28.420 --> 44:34.800
We just ask that our fans who are always so supportive of stuff like this to go to MBMBAMangels.com

44:34.800 --> 44:40.560
and check out some of the things that you can help out with for people in Huntington

44:40.560 --> 44:41.920
this holiday season.

44:41.920 --> 44:45.960
We sure do appreciate your generosity and we are sure that they do as well.

44:45.960 --> 44:47.520
Thank you to Maximum Fun for having us on the network.

44:47.520 --> 44:51.080
You can go to MaximumFun.org and check out all the great shows there.

44:51.080 --> 44:55.320
Shows like Lady to Lady, Stop Podcasting Yourself, Tights and Fights, and so many more.

44:55.320 --> 44:58.520
If you want to check out our other shows, you can go to McElroyShows.com.

44:58.520 --> 44:59.840
I think that's it.

44:59.840 --> 45:03.040
Thank you so much for listening and thank you to everybody at PodCon who came out to

45:03.040 --> 45:04.040
the panel.

45:04.040 --> 45:09.960
I think next week we are going to have just sort of a regular episode and then after that,

45:09.960 --> 45:14.120
well, two Mondays from now is actually Christmas Day, so it'll probably go up on Tuesday, but

45:14.120 --> 45:17.440
we're probably just going to put up our Candle Nights live show that we're doing in Huntington

45:17.440 --> 45:19.880
that we are so stoked for.

45:19.880 --> 45:23.760
Thank you all so much for grabbing tickets for that and helping it sell out as quickly

45:23.760 --> 45:24.760
as it did.

45:24.760 --> 45:27.720
So, yeah, we will talk to you next week.

45:27.720 --> 45:28.720
Goodbye.

45:28.720 --> 45:30.200
Hey, Helen Hong.

45:30.200 --> 45:33.640
Yes, J. Keith Van Straaten?

45:33.640 --> 45:36.000
What's the difference between a layover and a stopover?

45:36.000 --> 45:37.720
I have no idea.

45:37.720 --> 45:40.580
What's the difference between optimal and optimum?

45:40.580 --> 45:42.140
I have no idea.

45:42.140 --> 45:46.380
What's the difference between an actual conversation and a promo for our new show on Maximum Fun,

45:46.380 --> 45:47.380
Go Fact Yourself?

45:47.380 --> 45:49.380
Nobody has any idea.

45:49.380 --> 45:53.680
Go Fact Yourself, the game show with celebrity contestants, super smart experts, and answers

45:53.680 --> 45:55.880
to questions you've never even asked.

45:55.880 --> 46:01.160
Listen twice a month on MaximumFun.org or wherever you get your podcasts and be in the

46:01.160 --> 46:04.800
audience for our tapings of Go Fact Yourself in downtown L.A.

46:04.800 --> 46:05.800
It's free.

46:05.800 --> 46:08.720
Go to GoFactYourPod.com for more info.

46:08.720 --> 46:10.720
We're having a very realistic conversation.

46:10.720 --> 46:14.160
Yes, we are.

46:14.160 --> 46:16.240
I have another Yahoo if you all want it.

46:16.240 --> 46:17.240
Yeah.

46:17.240 --> 46:18.240
Well, do you want to...

46:18.240 --> 46:19.240
Okay.

46:19.240 --> 46:20.240
Yeah.

46:20.240 --> 46:21.240
What's wrong?

46:21.240 --> 46:22.240
No, I just...

46:22.240 --> 46:23.240
We had the other question.

46:23.240 --> 46:24.240
I didn't know if you wanted to...

46:24.240 --> 46:25.240
Yeah, let's do the Yahoo first.

46:25.240 --> 46:26.240
Yeah.

46:26.240 --> 46:27.240
It's from Aaron Keith sent this one in.

46:27.240 --> 46:28.240
Thank you, Aaron.

46:28.240 --> 46:29.240
It's Yahoo.

46:29.240 --> 46:30.240
It's an anonymous Yahoo answers user.

46:30.240 --> 46:32.000
We're going to call them...

46:32.000 --> 46:33.000
Anonymous.

46:33.000 --> 46:34.000
Okay.

46:34.000 --> 46:37.200
Travis decided that anonymous is the funniest name to call them.

46:37.200 --> 46:39.560
No, it's A. It's short for Aaron-nonymous.

46:39.560 --> 46:40.560
Aaron-nonymous.

46:40.560 --> 46:41.560
Oof.

46:41.560 --> 46:42.560
Still.

46:42.560 --> 46:50.440
Asks, what does Robert want for Christmas?

46:50.440 --> 46:57.160
Robert, are you here?

46:57.160 --> 46:58.440
Robert.

46:58.440 --> 47:01.600
Our group of friends are exchanging gifts for Christmas this year, but I have no idea

47:01.600 --> 47:03.160
what Robert wants.

47:03.160 --> 47:06.040
Hey, real quick show of hands.

47:06.040 --> 47:08.000
How many Roberts do we have?

47:08.000 --> 47:10.400
Okay, wait.

47:10.400 --> 47:11.400
Keep them up.

47:11.400 --> 47:12.620
One, two.

47:12.620 --> 47:14.120
This is your day, Roberts.

47:14.120 --> 47:15.120
Congrats.

47:15.120 --> 47:16.120
Hey, everybody.

47:16.120 --> 47:17.120
Not as many as I would have thought.

47:17.120 --> 47:19.120
Can I get every Robert to just stand up real quick?

47:19.120 --> 47:21.160
Hey, everybody, let's give them a big round of applause.

47:21.160 --> 47:24.320
Thank you to all the Roberts for coming out.

47:24.320 --> 47:25.320
So cool, you guys.

47:25.320 --> 47:26.320
Thank you.

47:26.320 --> 47:27.320
Yeah.

47:27.320 --> 47:28.760
We're going to get Robert here.

47:28.760 --> 47:29.760
Thank you, Robert.

47:29.760 --> 47:30.760
Now, sit down, Robert.

47:30.760 --> 47:31.760
That's it.

47:31.760 --> 47:32.760
All right.

47:32.760 --> 47:39.680
Now, the people who are with Robert, what does Robert want for Christmas?

47:39.680 --> 47:46.480
A copy of Terminator 2 on DVD so he can remember the great time he had shooting that movie

47:46.480 --> 47:48.040
with his friend Arnold Schwarzenegger.

47:48.040 --> 47:50.840
Yes, it's Robert Patrick.

47:50.840 --> 47:52.440
Robert Patrick's here?

47:52.440 --> 47:57.240
Maybe some nice, pulpy orange juice because it's Robert Loja, and that's about as

47:57.240 --> 48:01.200
deep a cut as I can possibly deliver here on My Brother, My Brother, Me is the orange

48:01.200 --> 48:05.000
juice commercial starring Robert Loja.

48:05.000 --> 48:10.920
After our show or during it, if it keeps up like this, Google Robert Loja orange juice

48:10.920 --> 48:11.920
commercial.

48:11.920 --> 48:12.920
You're in for a real treat.

48:12.920 --> 48:13.920
What is Robert?

48:13.920 --> 48:17.840
Maybe Robert wants 10,000 American dollars.

48:17.840 --> 48:19.240
Choice.

48:19.240 --> 48:21.240
It fits every time.

48:21.240 --> 48:26.240
Maybe what Robert wants is for you to get to know Robert well enough to know what Robert

48:26.240 --> 48:27.440
wants.

48:27.440 --> 48:29.480
Maybe you haven't spent enough time one-on-one.

48:29.480 --> 48:30.480
Applause.

48:30.480 --> 48:33.040
A weird peel of applause.

48:33.040 --> 48:37.160
Yeah, Robert's been in the dumps lately.

48:37.160 --> 48:38.720
Robert just wants a fucking friend.

48:38.720 --> 48:45.000
I need a new season of Serial to explain why that applause just happened.

48:45.000 --> 48:49.320
I need a forensic examination of where it started and who was my absolute friend.

48:49.320 --> 48:51.320
Maybe Robert needs a friend.

48:51.320 --> 48:52.320
Yes.

48:52.320 --> 48:55.300
Episode one would be like blink, blink, blink, blink.

48:55.300 --> 48:58.240
They certainly didn't earn that applause.

48:58.240 --> 49:02.200
Where did it come from?

49:02.200 --> 49:05.440
Maybe Robert wants you to fucking stop calling him Bob.

49:05.440 --> 49:08.600
Yeah, he would very much appreciate that.

49:08.600 --> 49:11.000
He's asked you so many times.

49:11.000 --> 49:13.120
I should have asked how many Bobs we have.

49:13.120 --> 49:14.600
Oh, how many Bobs?

49:14.600 --> 49:15.600
No, we're done.

49:15.600 --> 49:19.560
That bit plays once and sometimes not even that many times.

49:19.560 --> 49:21.920
How many people here aren't named Robert?

49:21.920 --> 49:31.280
Okay, one, two, uh, are you done talking about Robert?

49:31.280 --> 49:35.480
Robert's so great, but I'm actually done talking about Robert.

49:35.480 --> 49:36.480
Probably a blanket.

49:36.480 --> 49:38.520
How good's that last question?

49:38.520 --> 49:41.560
It's the one with the kid.

49:41.560 --> 49:43.040
I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.

49:43.040 --> 49:44.520
Now, let's go to audience questions.

49:44.520 --> 49:45.520
All right.

49:45.520 --> 49:46.520
Sorry, kid.

49:46.520 --> 49:51.360
I'm just gonna read it and then we won't address it, but now it won't be a fucking mystery.

49:51.360 --> 49:56.000
I don't want serial season three to be like, he said it was about a kid.

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
Blink, blink, blink.

49:58.000 --> 49:59.880
I have a nephew who just turned three years old.

49:59.880 --> 50:04.160
Whenever anyone is upset, he likes to diffuse the tension by yelling things and being silly

50:04.160 --> 50:05.600
until everyone is cheerful again.

50:05.600 --> 50:07.760
I'm right there with you, kid.

50:07.760 --> 50:08.760
That's adorable.

50:08.760 --> 50:15.400
However, lately his go-to phrase for this has been fucking A, which he picked up from

50:15.400 --> 50:16.400
my mom.

50:16.400 --> 50:18.880
While it's not a huge deal with us, he may be going to daycare soon and probably shouldn't

50:18.880 --> 50:20.860
be swearing around other people's kids.

50:20.860 --> 50:22.840
How do we get him to stop swearing?

50:22.840 --> 50:25.200
That's from Ant of a Cool Seattle Baby.

50:25.200 --> 50:26.200
Just get rules.

50:26.200 --> 50:27.200
Just get rules.

50:27.200 --> 50:28.200
I don't have an answer.

50:28.200 --> 50:29.200
Oh, hey, check this out.

50:29.200 --> 50:30.200
Hey, fucking A, you smell great.

50:30.200 --> 50:31.200
That's not...

50:31.200 --> 50:32.200
That does it.

50:32.200 --> 50:33.200
That's fine, right?

50:33.200 --> 50:34.200
Yeah.

50:34.200 --> 50:35.200
Let's hear it for the boy.

50:35.200 --> 50:36.200
Should we go to the audience questions now?

50:36.200 --> 50:37.200
Fucking A.

50:37.200 --> 50:38.200
Yeah, all right.

50:38.200 --> 50:43.200
Can we get lights up on the crowd?

50:43.200 --> 50:53.960
So, we have runners who are going to come by with microphones.

50:53.960 --> 50:58.000
Please stay chill about this.

50:58.000 --> 51:01.080
I need like full house lights because there's a bunch of people here and we can't see them

51:01.080 --> 51:02.080
at all.

51:02.080 --> 51:03.080
Now, listen.

51:03.080 --> 51:05.080
What I would need you all to do, if you have your hand raised...

51:05.080 --> 51:06.080
Oh, yeah.

51:06.080 --> 51:07.080
We have two rules.

51:07.080 --> 51:08.080
All right.

51:08.080 --> 51:14.160
What I think is the thing I'm about to ask an actual request for advice or is it just

51:14.160 --> 51:15.560
a funny story that I think is funny?

51:15.560 --> 51:17.160
Please do not let it be the latter.

51:17.160 --> 51:18.160
We also...

51:18.160 --> 51:19.160
Oh, shit.

51:19.160 --> 51:20.160
There's so many...

51:20.160 --> 51:21.160
We did a bad job of walking into this segment.

51:21.160 --> 51:22.160
You know the main rule is?

51:22.160 --> 51:23.160
No.

51:23.160 --> 51:24.160
No.

51:24.160 --> 51:25.160
No.

51:25.160 --> 51:26.160
No.

51:26.160 --> 51:27.160
No.

51:27.160 --> 51:28.160
No.

51:28.160 --> 51:29.160
No.

51:29.160 --> 51:30.160
No.

51:30.160 --> 51:31.160
No.

51:31.160 --> 51:32.160
No.

51:32.160 --> 51:33.160
No.

51:33.160 --> 51:34.160
No.

51:34.160 --> 51:35.160
No.

51:35.160 --> 51:36.160
No.

51:36.160 --> 51:37.160
No.

51:37.160 --> 51:38.160
No.

51:38.160 --> 51:39.160
No.

51:39.160 --> 51:40.160
All right.

51:40.160 --> 51:41.160
Stay there, stay there.

51:41.160 --> 51:42.160
Stay there.

51:42.160 --> 51:43.160
You're number one.

51:43.160 --> 51:44.160
And then, on this side sitting on the aisle with the black shirt.

51:44.160 --> 51:45.160
You're pointing at yourself.

51:45.160 --> 51:46.160
Yeah.

51:46.160 --> 51:47.160
Yeah.

51:47.160 --> 51:48.160
Yeah.

51:48.160 --> 51:49.160
Cool.

51:49.160 --> 51:50.160
All right.

51:50.160 --> 51:51.160
We'll start with you since you were there first.

51:51.160 --> 51:52.160
What's your name?

51:52.160 --> 51:53.160
Lisa?

51:53.160 --> 51:54.160
Hi, Lisa.

51:54.160 --> 51:55.160
What's you're question?

51:55.160 --> 51:57.120
So, I'm in charge of entertainment for a company party.

51:57.120 --> 52:05.080
It's a global event and I've accidentally booked three different acapella groups for

52:05.080 --> 52:06.080
the same.

52:06.080 --> 52:07.080
Another?

52:07.080 --> 52:14.580
Okay, can I get the audience mics turned up like twice as loud as they are right now?

52:14.580 --> 52:18.300
Because I want to experience every moment of this with you.

52:18.300 --> 52:21.940
You have booked multiple three acapella groups for one party.

52:21.940 --> 52:25.820
For a half hour period.

52:25.820 --> 52:28.620
And it's on Tuesday.

52:28.620 --> 52:29.620
How do you quit your job?

52:29.620 --> 52:33.700
How do I change my identity and move to Canada?

52:33.700 --> 52:35.140
Okay, that's very good.

52:35.140 --> 52:37.400
Wait, I do want to hear the request.

52:37.400 --> 52:39.240
What do you need our help with?

52:39.240 --> 52:40.720
Did I make a mistake?

52:40.720 --> 52:41.720
No.

52:41.720 --> 52:42.960
Okay, what's here?

52:42.960 --> 52:43.960
What is the actual question?

52:43.960 --> 52:46.240
What should I do about that?

52:46.240 --> 52:48.680
Yeah, we can work with that.

52:48.680 --> 52:49.680
What's your name?

52:49.680 --> 52:50.680
Hi, I'm Lex.

52:50.680 --> 52:52.600
Hi Lex, what's your question?

52:52.600 --> 52:58.040
So I live with my boyfriend and we keep getting into this argument over whether we should

52:58.040 --> 53:01.300
have a Lord of the Rings wedding.

53:01.300 --> 53:07.740
I am asking you to help me convince him to just have a normal like elegant wedding.

53:07.740 --> 53:10.720
I'm kind of a closet nerd.

53:10.720 --> 53:11.720
Okay.

53:11.720 --> 53:13.720
I know that's a bad one to ask you.

53:13.720 --> 53:18.160
No, well, hold on.

53:18.160 --> 53:22.480
Because under and between the beautiful cliffs of Rivendell, I think you could throw a pretty

53:22.480 --> 53:23.480
fucking elegant wedding.

53:23.480 --> 53:26.900
That's what I'm saying, don't assume.

53:26.900 --> 53:27.900
The elves.

53:27.900 --> 53:31.960
The elves know how to throw an elegant soiree.

53:31.960 --> 53:32.960
Can I tell you something?

53:32.960 --> 53:33.960
Okay, straight up.

53:33.960 --> 53:34.960
We're going to do the acapella one.

53:34.960 --> 53:37.520
The acapella one, I'm going to do it because that's the best shit I've ever heard.

53:37.520 --> 53:38.800
But you can help with that.

53:38.800 --> 53:40.240
But it's not that your question is not good.

53:40.240 --> 53:42.960
I can answer it in one like one sentence.

53:42.960 --> 53:43.960
Here he goes.

53:43.960 --> 53:46.160
Everybody step back.

53:46.160 --> 53:50.560
You only get one wedding and everyone does just a wedding.

53:50.560 --> 53:53.640
We had a Lord of the Rings wedding is way more interesting.

53:53.640 --> 53:54.640
For sure.

53:54.640 --> 54:05.880
Tell them you want to do a Buckaroo Bonsai themed wedding and then settle.

54:05.880 --> 54:10.440
And then when you can't agree, just be like, fine, we'll just do a normal wedding then.

54:10.440 --> 54:12.960
I love Buckaroo Bonsai.

54:12.960 --> 54:15.120
What about a labyrinth themed wedding?

54:15.120 --> 54:17.480
Okay, there you go.

54:17.480 --> 54:18.480
Thank you.

54:18.480 --> 54:23.520
Would you do a normal wedding, but both of you had to carry big, big swords?

54:23.520 --> 54:25.720
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

54:25.720 --> 54:27.280
Here's the compromise.

54:27.280 --> 54:31.640
Normal wedding, but tell one person in the bridal party that it's a Lord of the Rings

54:31.640 --> 54:32.640
themed wedding.

54:32.640 --> 54:33.640
Yes.

54:33.640 --> 54:34.640
Yes.

54:34.640 --> 54:37.240
I think we should reserve that for what?

54:37.240 --> 54:38.240
Maybe your brother?

54:38.240 --> 54:39.240
Yeah.

54:39.240 --> 54:40.240
No.

54:40.240 --> 54:41.240
Perfect.

54:41.240 --> 54:42.240
Perfect.

54:42.240 --> 54:43.240
Send him links to costumes, everything.

54:43.240 --> 54:44.920
There's only one person in your bridal party.

54:44.920 --> 54:45.960
It's Andy Serkis.

54:45.960 --> 54:48.320
He's wearing a green screen suit.

54:48.320 --> 54:53.120
And then on your cut of the wedding movie, he's just wearing a normal tuxedo.

54:53.120 --> 54:57.680
And the other one, he's everyone's favorite little monster named Gollum.

54:57.680 --> 54:58.680
Thank you very much.

54:58.680 --> 54:59.680
Thank you.

54:59.680 --> 55:01.480
Okay, a cappella groups.

55:01.480 --> 55:08.960
Did you book three a cappella groups for a half hour or did you book one new super cool

55:08.960 --> 55:11.280
a cappella group for half hour?

55:11.280 --> 55:12.920
Because I think it's the latter.

55:12.920 --> 55:16.160
I think that this is a lot of behind the music start this way.

55:16.160 --> 55:19.600
Like we were just three different a cappella groups, weren't we?

55:19.600 --> 55:22.440
And we all showed up for the same gig, believe it or not.

55:22.440 --> 55:25.840
And we decided, hey, let's all sing together.

55:25.840 --> 55:26.840
And then.

55:26.840 --> 55:28.320
And that's how the Beatles got started.

55:28.320 --> 55:30.840
That's how the Beatles got started, didn't they?

55:30.840 --> 55:34.920
So the polyphonic spree got started.

55:34.920 --> 55:38.520
If you just pay all of them and two of them don't have to sing, they're probably happy

55:38.520 --> 55:39.520
about that.

55:39.520 --> 55:40.520
They're probably good.

55:40.520 --> 55:41.520
You're like, here's your $30.

55:41.520 --> 55:42.520
Like, oh, dunk.

55:42.520 --> 55:43.520
Okay, bye.

55:43.520 --> 55:44.520
How did you?

55:44.520 --> 55:45.520
How did you do this?

55:45.520 --> 55:46.520
How did you do this?

55:46.520 --> 55:49.520
How did you fuck up this bad?

55:49.520 --> 55:54.280
How did you were you on a like conference call and you didn't realize that you said

55:54.280 --> 56:01.760
you're hired and you heard three beautiful choral voices say, thank you.

56:01.760 --> 56:09.440
I was told to book some entertainment on Thursday.

56:09.440 --> 56:15.560
And I just reached out to as many groups as I could and some with instruments and some

56:15.560 --> 56:16.560
without.

56:16.560 --> 56:21.560
Yes, but the only ones available for that were available and that close of a notice

56:21.560 --> 56:23.840
were the acapella groups.

56:23.840 --> 56:26.560
And what was the wording of this content?

56:26.560 --> 56:29.080
Like you are hired sight unseen.

56:29.080 --> 56:30.080
Just say yes.

56:30.080 --> 56:32.480
It was more like we've seen your videos.

56:32.480 --> 56:33.480
We're very interested.

56:33.480 --> 56:34.480
Were you lying?

56:34.480 --> 56:35.480
Yes.

56:35.480 --> 56:36.480
Okay.

56:36.480 --> 56:37.480

56:37.480 --> 56:38.480

57:19.360 --> 57:23.600
yeah cuz we're just gonna lose these fucking microphones we will start now

57:23.600 --> 57:30.120
with you what's your name hello my name is Emeline hi Emeline hello Emeline so we

57:30.120 --> 57:36.480
have too many furries in our D&D party what no such thing next question

57:36.480 --> 57:46.480
Why are you trying to get us in trouble again? We got in trouble once alright we'll never do that again.

57:46.480 --> 57:56.480
Hello Toronto! We got a lot of furries today! Listen! I love the culture and lifestyle!

57:56.480 --> 58:00.480
You're all so supportive of each other in other projects!

58:00.480 --> 58:04.480
There's a bit on there about five minutes later when Paul said he's like

58:04.480 --> 58:08.480
Do any girls out there like to get licked?

58:08.480 --> 58:10.480
Yeah it's a bad part of the audio.

58:10.480 --> 58:12.480
There's a bad part of the audio and then instantly afterwards

58:12.480 --> 58:14.480
he's like and God bless him Paul Stanley goes

58:14.480 --> 58:18.480
Do any guys out there like to get licked?

58:18.480 --> 58:22.480
It's like good for you Paul let's just ask everybody if they like to get licked

58:22.480 --> 58:26.480
What about all our gender non-binary people?

58:26.480 --> 58:34.480
Who doesn't conform to the gender spectrum but likes to get licked?

58:34.480 --> 58:38.480
We will consider that question I do not know

58:38.480 --> 58:44.480
Let me offer a small reason. There's not enough furries in my group.

58:44.480 --> 58:48.480
Is it a party composition issue where everybody wants to play like a bug bear

58:48.480 --> 58:53.480
or some sort of I don't know if there are furry races in D&D

58:53.480 --> 58:56.480
Okay yes there are actually Jeffrey

58:56.480 --> 58:58.480
That's so sweet okay all right

58:58.480 --> 59:00.480
Hi what's your name?

59:00.480 --> 59:01.480
Heda

59:01.480 --> 59:02.480
Hi

59:02.480 --> 59:06.480
Hi so for the last five years I've been trying to distance myself from

59:06.480 --> 59:09.480
quite the extensive goth face

59:09.480 --> 59:10.480
Okay

59:10.480 --> 59:11.480
As I'm sure many of us can relate to

59:11.480 --> 59:12.480
So I'm here

59:12.480 --> 59:13.480
For sure

59:13.480 --> 59:14.480
Yeah tell me about it

59:14.480 --> 59:16.480
Unless you're still into it in which case stand in your truth

59:16.480 --> 59:21.480
Well something that's made that quite difficult is that my family owns

59:21.480 --> 59:23.480
a number of funeral homes

59:23.480 --> 59:24.480
Okay

59:24.480 --> 59:26.480
A number?

59:26.480 --> 59:27.480
A number of funeral homes

59:27.480 --> 59:30.480
Is the number more than one?

59:30.480 --> 59:31.480
Yes

59:31.480 --> 59:33.480
That's quite a lot of funeral homes

59:33.480 --> 59:34.480
That's quite a lot of funeral homes

59:34.480 --> 59:37.480
Congratulations that sounds like a very profitable business

59:37.480 --> 59:38.480
Congrats to your family

59:38.480 --> 59:42.480
Yeah so what what do I do when my friends walk past funeral homes

59:42.480 --> 59:45.480
with my last name slapped up over them in a frankly way too gothic font

59:45.480 --> 59:48.480
You flash that dead cash

59:48.480 --> 59:51.480
I'm gonna help I'm gonna help you it's time

59:51.480 --> 59:52.480
I think we're gonna go with this one

59:52.480 --> 59:53.480
Thank you very very much

59:53.480 --> 59:54.480
Very much

59:54.480 --> 59:55.480
I'm gonna help you and it's very

59:55.480 --> 59:57.480
Can we get a round of applause for Emeline please

59:57.480 --> 59:58.480
Thank you

59:58.480 --> 59:59.480
Round of applause for Emeline

59:59.480 --> 01:00:04.480
Get more furries the lights again the lights if I could just have those lights back

01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:06.480
The lights do keep disappearing

01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:11.480
It's time for you to rebel against the family business and what I mean by that

01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:14.480
I mean never die

01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:16.480
What a cool thing for you to be like

01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:19.480
That's not the opposite of being a funeral home

01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:24.480
Yeah no it's like hey listen mom and dad sorry I'm not interested in the family biz

01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:27.480
I'm never gonna die

01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:30.480
And he just loudly and now and like anytime they start talking about it

01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:34.480
Just be like death that's for suckers

01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:36.480
I don't buy it show me the evidence

01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:40.480
Make sure you do that while funerals are happening at the funeral

01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:44.480
Got another one huh death what a sucker

01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:45.480
What a waste of cash

01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:48.480
Get you to the coffin next time try not dying

01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:55.480
Yeah that's my thing and the thing is that's great about that is it works until it doesn't

01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:57.480
And then you don't have to be there

01:00:57.480 --> 01:01:02.480
You don't have to sweat it like you're basically immortal in that sense if you think about it

01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:03.480
We're all temporarily immortal

01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:06.480
Jesus okay now that essential dread is great

01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:09.480
Listen this is the first time our show has ever been interesting

01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:14.480
Listen listen listen is it a fun funeral home

01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:16.480
Is there a ball pit

01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:17.480
Is there a ball pit

01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:18.480
A funeral home

01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:20.480
The ball pit is full of skulls

01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:22.480
What the fuck

01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:23.480
I'm kidding I'm kidding

01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:26.480
Is that the aesthetic of your funeral homes

01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:27.480
Okay listen

01:01:27.480 --> 01:01:28.480
No it's very classy

01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:31.480
Okay okay straight up

01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:35.480
Your family owns a number of funeral homes

01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:39.480
You should just keep being goth because then people will see you out and about

01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:42.480
Hear me out and they're like oh god and then like you're like come with me

01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:47.480
My home's full of dead people and they're like come by it on us

01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:53.480
I'm sorry there are some gross misconceptions about what funeral homes are happening on this stage

01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:57.480
They're not chock-a-block full of dead people

01:01:57.480 --> 01:01:59.480
Okay wait hold on hold on

01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:01.480
They're not sorting through a queue

01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:05.480
Okay but statistically speaking are there more dead people in a funeral home than your home

01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:08.480
I am the oldest brother

01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:15.480
I am 37 years old and I'm ready to talk about anything else

01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:19.480
I hope that helped because this segment is over

01:02:19.480 --> 01:02:21.480
Thank you very much

01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:23.480
All right let's get those house lights back eh

01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:24.480
House lights way up

01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:26.480
Let's get somebody way over

01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:32.480
Okay we don't usually do this for prop work but somebody has a sign that says the dog pound and I'm very interested in

01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:33.480
Dog pounds in

01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:34.480
Absolutely

01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:36.480
Well I guess whoever wants it

01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:39.480
And someone has an actual dog with their hands raised

01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:41.480
With the dog in it oh okay

01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:44.480
Hell yeah I hope this question is about the dog

01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:46.480
Oh wait does the dog have a question

01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:48.480
Oh the dog pound sign yes the dog pound sign

01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:49.480
You're holding it

01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:51.480
Oh wait a minute hold on

01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:52.480
Hold on was that it

01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:53.480
I have to change my mind

01:02:53.480 --> 01:02:57.480
The dog pound we all have brothers do you guys fight a lot like

01:02:57.480 --> 01:02:58.480
Is that the question

01:02:58.480 --> 01:02:59.480
Yeah that's

01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:00.480
That's not advice

01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:04.480
You don't need advice just like I want to find out a little bit more about those three crazy mackerel eyes

01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:05.480
We never fight

01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:07.480
The dog pound like many other mackerel

01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:08.480
What is this hive mind

01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:09.480
Bound out

01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:11.480
We are dog pound

01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:12.480
Okay

01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:13.480
Hello

01:03:13.480 --> 01:03:14.480
Hi I'm Cory

01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:15.480
What's your name

01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:16.480
Sorry

01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:17.480
Cory

01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:18.480
Hey Cory

01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:19.480
And the dog's name

01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:20.480
This is Falkor

01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:21.480
Oh yes

01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:22.480
Yeah

01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:23.480
Oh Lord of the Rings

01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:26.480
Shit

01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:28.480
I see I was gonna make an Amadeus Amadeus joke

01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:29.480
Nope

01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:30.480
And I backed off

01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:32.480
What is the question

01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:38.480
So I was at the dentist the other day and the dentist was telling me about her favorite super movie superhero movies

01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:41.480
This is starting to sound like a joke like a joke with a punchline

01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:42.480
No it's good okay okay

01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:46.480
I mean there's a jokey thing in it but I have a real question

01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:49.480
While I had the dental dam in she told me her favorite

01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:50.480
Is that what it's called

01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:51.480
Yes

01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:53.480
Groany okay

01:03:53.480 --> 01:03:56.480
She told me her favorite character was X-Man

01:03:56.480 --> 01:03:57.480
And

01:03:57.480 --> 01:04:00.480
Oh no

01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:03.480
She thinks Wolverine's name is X-Man

01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:05.480
Okay good good good

01:04:05.480 --> 01:04:06.480
I couldn't say anything

01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:07.480
Right

01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:10.480
And then later it seemed too late but now I'm worried

01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:13.480
That she's gonna like have some dude bro

01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:16.480
She's gonna say this to him and they're gonna be really condescending

01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:17.480
Yeah

01:04:17.480 --> 01:04:20.480
No yeah that's definitely getting the pipeline I feel like unfortunately

01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:25.480
Actually in fact when she said X-Man some dude bro somewhere went

01:04:25.480 --> 01:04:26.480
Wrong

01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:31.480
You should yeah the windows must be very thick there because I bet a guy was like flinging himself against it

01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:35.480
Well actually well actually wait actually

01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:36.480
Dogpound thank you very much

01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:39.480
Thank you Dogpound I'm gonna help this Wolverine

01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:44.480
When you said you couldn't did you mean because you were petrified by awkwardness

01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:48.480
Because that's what I would feel if someone said my favorite superhero is X-Man I would go

01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:49.480
Oh

01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:53.480
I mean I would get worried that this is some silver age bullshit that I didn't actually know about

01:04:53.480 --> 01:05:00.480
I'd be like X-Man's not a thing and I'd be like actually in 1941 Jack Kirby did something or whatever

01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:03.480
I don't know anything about fucking comic books at all

01:05:03.480 --> 01:05:06.480
Our dad's backstage freaking out

01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:09.480
The uh uh

01:05:09.480 --> 01:05:16.480
Maybe this is a trap and you avoided it but I used to do that with like I would say wrong facts

01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:18.480
Because I saw something remember that episode of News Radio

01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:19.480
We're not gonna talk about News Radio right now

01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:23.480
But one of the characters would lay out raw incorrect facts

01:05:23.480 --> 01:05:25.480
And when someone would correct it they'd go

01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:27.480
Aw geek jack I actually dig that a lot

01:05:27.480 --> 01:05:29.480
So maybe this is a trap for do bros

01:05:29.480 --> 01:05:33.480
Like uh actually it's Wolverine like yeah I know it's fucking Wolverine

01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:34.480
And then they pull a tooth

01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:35.480
Yeah

01:05:35.480 --> 01:05:36.480
I knew it

01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:44.480
Oh shit maybe they were just distracting you from the tooth tricks they were about to pull on you

01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:47.480
By putting a little brain teaser in your like

01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:50.480
Hey you know who I love is Golden Guy

01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:53.480
And it's like Golden Guy who the fuck is Golden Guy

01:05:53.480 --> 01:05:55.480
I don't even oh my tooth is gone

01:05:55.480 --> 01:05:58.480
They're pretty sneaky Dennis

01:05:58.480 --> 01:06:02.480
I would actually rather have a Dennis say that their favorite X-Man

01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:05.480
Their favorite superhero is X-Man rather than Wolverine

01:06:05.480 --> 01:06:10.480
Cause I'd just be like I don't know there's way more interesting superheroes than Wolverine

01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:14.480
Is there his bones aren't real

01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:17.480
Whoa

01:06:17.480 --> 01:06:21.480
I'm gonna say Nightcrawler is better than Wolverine

01:06:21.480 --> 01:06:25.480
Wolverine is like a thousand years old you hang on with Jesus

01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:28.480
Nightcrawler is like a demon

01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:35.480
Whoa Wolverine's got metal bones I can do that one twice it's so cool

01:06:35.480 --> 01:06:36.480
Damn it

01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:37.480
You're right

01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:40.480
This is the greatest thing I've ever heard I'm so glad you didn't correct them

01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:44.480
There's still so this is we get these gifts you've given us a gift

01:06:44.480 --> 01:06:47.480
Because we will never meet this dentist probably

01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:51.480
But I know that there's somebody out there who thinks Wolverine's name is X-Man

01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:54.480
And while that may bring you worry for that person

01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:57.480
It brings me a great amount of joy because they don't know any

01:06:57.480 --> 01:07:01.480
They won't know any better until some dude bro does come in and smash through the window

01:07:01.480 --> 01:07:05.480
But for now let's just celebrate the moment of X-Man

01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:10.480
How does your dentist square away the knowledge that the name of the group is X-Men

01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:12.480
Like it's X-Man and his X-Men

01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:17.480
X-Man and his excellent X-Men

01:07:17.480 --> 01:07:22.480
I mean they have out they do there is a band called Alvin and the Chipmunks

01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:25.480
You ever fucking think about that that's actually really messed up

01:07:25.480 --> 01:07:30.480
If you think about Alvin and uh we'll just name him by their species I guess I don't know

01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:37.480
Also we're dumb asses there's a dude named Professor X

01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:38.480
He is an X-Man

01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:40.480
How is that any better than X-Man

01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:42.480
It's not any better

01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:43.480
Does that

01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:45.480
Is that anything

01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:46.480
Is that anything

01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:48.480
I think it eases my conscience

01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:51.480
Thank you that's the least we could do

01:07:51.480 --> 01:07:54.480
Alright folks you can go ahead and drop the house lights down

01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:57.480
We have got a wrap up for the evening

01:07:57.480 --> 01:07:59.480
Thank you

01:07:59.480 --> 01:08:04.480
But here's the good news there's a whole other day of PodCon tomorrow

01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:08.480

01:08:25.480 --> 01:08:29.480
No seriously this is a really really cool event and it's really special

01:08:29.480 --> 01:08:34.480
And I'm so glad that all these folks who I've listened to for a while have all gotten together

01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:37.480
And I've gotten to hear them talk about smart things it's very cool

01:08:37.480 --> 01:08:42.480
Yeah not only I will say it's so great to get to spend time with you our wonderful audience

01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:48.480
But also to spend time with like Francesca Lee and you know Kevin Porter and Gabby Dunn

And meet these amazing people who make amazing work

01:08:50.480 --> 01:08:53.480
And to meet you also we've gotten to meet a bunch of folks

01:08:53.480 --> 01:08:56.480
A lot of Adventure Zone cosplayers which is fucking super rad

01:08:56.480 --> 01:09:02.480
When I look out at this crowd and think god every one of them is a podcast

01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:07.480
It's so inspirational to me to be seeing so many podcasts in one room

01:09:07.480 --> 01:09:12.480
And we've made a lot of great podcasts today and I hope to see some more of you tomorrow

01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:14.480
Toronto

01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:18.480
Alright oh and thank you to John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song

01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:21.480
It's been a pleasure putting the days to bed

01:09:21.480 --> 01:09:26.480
Oh hey real quick we come from an area called West Virginia

01:09:26.480 --> 01:09:29.480
Oh yeah but leave it or not

01:09:29.480 --> 01:09:36.480
Around the holiday season some folks there don't have enough to make ends meet let alone buy Christmas presents

01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:39.480
And every year there's a thing called the empty stockings list

01:09:39.480 --> 01:09:44.480
And it's a list the newspaper publishes full of people that just want to get maybe something for Christmas

01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:48.480
A gift for a kid or a lot of times just basic necessities

01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:50.480
A sleeping bag a tent what have you

01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:55.480
And we like to sick our fans on it and just like run wild like

01:09:55.480 --> 01:09:59.480
Like in a good way imagine wolves but they're charitable

01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:01.480
It's like a pack of charitable wolves

01:10:01.480 --> 01:10:06.480
If you can kick in a few bucks it's mbambangels.com

01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:13.480
Is that thing and if you could go there and you can buy a gift for someone that someone is asking for

01:10:13.480 --> 01:10:17.480
And it goes right to them it's like it'll make you feel great

01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:21.480
And if you can do it and help us help our area that we'd really appreciate it

01:10:21.480 --> 01:10:25.480
