WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:44.480
It's a new craze, and good girls do you want it? Just say, hey I wanna. Just say, hey I wanna.

00:44.480 --> 00:51.440
Pass the dutchie, it's time for Passover. With me, Justin Mac... Let him do it. Pass the dutchie,

00:51.440 --> 00:57.680
it's time for Passover. With me, the honorable rabbi Justin McElroy. Your venerate, your grace,

00:57.680 --> 01:05.280
your grace. Yes, yes my son. Please do pass the dutchie. I'll pass the dutchie, it's the 15th of,

01:05.280 --> 01:12.960
today's the 15th of Nissan, everybody, and that means it's Passover time, so let's pass that,

01:13.600 --> 01:22.160
pass it over here, that last... Dutchie's a weed, right? It's like a jazz cigarette? Yeah, that is

01:22.160 --> 01:30.240
very different from Passover, which here is the literal thing that I found just now when I was

01:30.240 --> 01:37.280
researching Passover to make sure my goos were not only insightful but relevant. It's the blood on

01:37.280 --> 01:42.080
the door, right? Or the white paint? What was it? It's you find a red door and you want it painted

01:42.080 --> 01:50.000
black. Fox News says, why is Passover the most celebrated Jewish holiday in America? And Fox

01:50.000 --> 01:58.320
News answers, simply put, like America itself, Passover is about freedom. Because Passover rules

01:58.320 --> 02:04.400
and eagles and stuff. That's true. Passover rules, put a firecracker in your butt, eat some cake,

02:04.400 --> 02:12.000
it's Passover time. Fuck yeah, Passover. Get ready to get passed over, Nazis. Is the freedom to not

02:12.720 --> 02:18.720
be murdered by an agent of the Lord? Is that what... That's the... No, the freedom was,

02:18.720 --> 02:24.880
it was freedom from the Pharaoh, from the Egyptians. Right, but some fools got wrecked,

02:24.880 --> 02:29.680
right? Because it was the plagues and shit. Oh yeah, all the Egyptians. It was a freedom from

02:29.680 --> 02:35.760
having to look at all the Egyptians' first born children. I'm sick of looking at all these fat,

02:35.760 --> 02:42.880
ugly little kids. Fat Derek. I wish an angel would come down with a flaming sword. I wish there would

02:42.880 --> 02:50.160
be a great reaping. Hey, pass that Dutch. Pass the Dutchie. Kids, not Jewish kids, but kids,

02:50.160 --> 02:55.120
you know, Jewish kids in that period, must have been pretty cool because they were the only kids

02:55.120 --> 03:01.440
to have a prominent, deep-seated, and very practical fear of angels. You could at any point

03:01.440 --> 03:04.240
threaten that an angel's coming for them and they'd like hide under their bed. Dad, did you

03:04.240 --> 03:10.000
put the blood on the door? I'll do it later. Dad! Dad, do it now! What's the matter with you?

03:10.000 --> 03:16.720
This is vital, Daddy. Dad, you didn't buy that. Oh, you bought store brand blood? Come on, Dad!

03:16.720 --> 03:22.320
Get the name brand stuff. You can turn on the faucet and it's blood, because that was an earlier

03:22.320 --> 03:29.680
plague, Daddy. It couldn't be easier. It's a whole different plague, Papa. The other thing that Fox

03:29.680 --> 03:36.160
News tells me about Passover, I'm just getting all my Passover facts from Fox News. Why is wine so

03:36.160 --> 03:42.640
prominently featured at the cedar meal? Drinking wine, especially over a leisurely meal, expresses

03:42.640 --> 03:48.400
the freedom of those gathered together and demonstrating that freedom is central to the

03:48.400 --> 03:54.960
feature, is the central feature of the cedar. Fox News is super hung up on the patriotism.

03:54.960 --> 03:58.400
You're showing your hand a little bit too, because I'm pretty sure it's cedar. It's cedar.

03:58.400 --> 04:03.200
Although a cedar meal sounds delicious. Oh, this is hickory smoked barbecue. Oh, is this salmon?

04:03.200 --> 04:08.720
This is delicious. Throw it over some cedar chips. That's what I meant. What were you guys talking

04:08.720 --> 04:13.360
about? I was talking about, you know, the nymphs and the satyrs and the games around and they eat

04:13.360 --> 04:19.840
the food as a stretch. That joke was a stretch. I apologize. They pass you a big fat J, but they

04:19.840 --> 04:27.280
pass it counterclockwise. That song would have been way better and much, much clearer if it had

04:27.280 --> 04:36.640
been passed the dutchy counterclockwise word. So this is my brother and my brother mates.

04:36.640 --> 04:39.360
It's an advice show. Was that all offensive? Like, do people...

04:40.400 --> 04:44.240
It may not... It has shit to do with the plagues, right? Like, it's been a while since...

04:44.240 --> 04:49.280
Yeah, it is. It's about the angel passing over the children and not killing them. Okay, cool. Cool

04:49.280 --> 04:55.120
all day. But like, Fox News doesn't mention plagues. I don't know. I wish that I had a...

04:55.120 --> 05:00.400
I don't know. I wish I had a holiday that I celebrated. Maybe I should get down with Passover.

05:00.400 --> 05:05.760
I've never fucked with Passover before, but I wish I had a holiday that had the eating of

05:05.760 --> 05:11.760
Thanksgiving with some of the ceremony of like an Easter. You know what I mean? Yeah, it's called

05:11.760 --> 05:17.920
Easter. I guess that's true, but like Easter... I don't think of Easter as being like a big eating

05:17.920 --> 05:23.760
holiday. Oh, it is. You get the ham and then you get cake eggs and you just go to town. Yeah,

05:23.760 --> 05:31.200
but it's not standardized, you know? Sater, they have, you know, latkes, they have challah bread.

05:31.200 --> 05:35.040
They get down with it. Black and white cookies? Black and white cookies, do they do that on

05:35.040 --> 05:44.720
Passover? I don't like ham. Yeah, Justin also doesn't like ham. I like ham. I don't like ham,

05:44.720 --> 05:50.400
really. If I go to a place and ham's the only meat available, like, I really don't like ham.

05:50.400 --> 05:56.480
Mm-hmm. I don't get it. Let me hit you with this. Let me bounce this off you. How do you feel about

05:56.480 --> 06:02.880
unleavened bread? Good question. That sounds pretty good. Okay. It sounds pretty good. Sorry,

06:02.880 --> 06:07.120
let me reframe it. How do you feel about leavened bread? Because you pretty much have to get rid of

06:07.120 --> 06:15.680
all that. I would miss leavened bread. Yeah. I'm assuming that the stuff in hot dog buns is leavened,

06:15.680 --> 06:19.440
right? No, it's unleavened. You're good. It's unleavened, that's fine. Here's the only way

06:19.440 --> 06:23.760
you can tell is you have to put the bread in water, and if it sinks, it's unleavened. If it

06:23.760 --> 06:28.560
floats, it's a witch. I'm sorry, it has to be toilet water. You have to put it in the toilet

06:28.560 --> 06:34.080
because that's the only kind of water that works as a litmus test. You have to test each piece

06:34.080 --> 06:38.400
individually because you can't just assume the entire package is leavened. Did you guys know

06:38.960 --> 06:43.520
that s'mores were invented when people were trying to figure out if marshmallows were witches?

06:43.520 --> 06:52.080
That's a true story I made up. That's true. And they said that I can't be sure, but the one thing

06:52.080 --> 06:56.960
I am sure about is this is delicious. I feel ice. What do you think, Reverend Hershey? Let's toast

06:56.960 --> 07:04.080
it. Hey, I've got a totally dope idea. Hey, pass that J and let me drop some science on you guys.

07:04.800 --> 07:09.440
Thanks, Reverend Hershey, and we shall form a town here and we'll make chocolate and shit.

07:09.440 --> 07:14.240
It'll be awesome. Give me those Doritos. I can't stop eating these things. They must be ensorcelled.

07:16.000 --> 07:20.480
How could you do this to us, Marshmallow? We're building a community. This is My Brother, My

07:20.480 --> 07:24.880
Brother, Me. It's a advice show from the modern era, and we know a lot about Drew stuff. Trust me.

07:25.600 --> 07:30.000
Here's the first question. Also, to answer your question, Griffin, I don't know if that was

07:30.000 --> 07:34.960
offensive or not, but if it was offensive, it came from the most pure source of something

07:34.960 --> 07:41.520
to be offensive, and that is ignorance. The one thing you cannot be angry about someone being

07:41.520 --> 07:49.520
offensive for is ignorance. That is the one thing that is okay to be offensive. Will you

07:49.520 --> 07:55.760
learn anything from Archie Bunker and Family Guy if that shit is funny as long as the person is

07:55.760 --> 08:04.800
stupid? Sure. But that's a pretty bad catch-all, though. That kind of catches a lot of shit,

08:04.800 --> 08:11.600
though. Yeah, it's a lot of things in there. Let's spread our ignorant seed. Let's spread it.

08:11.600 --> 08:15.840
My boyfriend and I will be house-sitting for his favorite professor over the summer,

08:15.840 --> 08:20.560
and I plan to live with him while he stays there. Although I am excited to live with my boyfriend

08:20.560 --> 08:27.360
in a real adult's house, I do have one qualm. If we were to have sex in the professor's home,

08:28.000 --> 08:34.480
would it stir up bad juju there? If so, how can we protect the professor from any strange

08:34.480 --> 08:41.760
residual sex energy that's from the boorish border? Is he a professor of voodoo? Let's tackle

08:42.400 --> 08:48.320
this big question. Okay. Somebody house-sits for you, they fuck in your house, you come home.

08:49.120 --> 08:52.880
Maybe it doesn't even have to be that, like you're at a party and you walk into a room.

08:52.880 --> 09:00.720
Can you guys tell when someone's been freaking? Oh, yeah. If someone's been freaking in my home

09:00.720 --> 09:05.840
and I walk in the door, I turn into R. Kelly. I'm like, my hands are in the air. I'm like,

09:05.840 --> 09:15.120
oh no. You're not catching them in the act. You could tell. What's up guys? What are you doing?

09:15.120 --> 09:19.440
You're not watching people express love to each other physically with love acts.

09:19.440 --> 09:26.080
I'm talking about you walk into a room and like the specter of fuck is just like hanging.

09:26.080 --> 09:32.800
No, I'm saying I can sense that and every time that someone's had sex in my house when I wasn't

09:32.800 --> 09:38.320
there, I felt like you look at my hair, it was standing straight up like I just took off a wool

09:38.320 --> 09:44.640
sweater. I know when people have been doing dirty in my home. You can see your breath.

09:45.600 --> 09:51.280
There's a doorknob. The doorknob is red. I can see my breath because I'm pressed against the glass.

09:51.280 --> 09:57.280
I'm watching this go down. It's my home. Misha Barton is there. She's thrown up. You're so gross,

09:57.280 --> 10:01.280
Misha Barton. Get out of here. The question is, does the professor know that you're going to be

10:01.280 --> 10:06.000
staying there too? Because if so, he already knows what's up. If you're like, I'm staying here with

10:06.000 --> 10:11.920
my boyfriend. Also, he's fucking dirty. I wouldn't stay in the house now. I wouldn't stay at any house

10:11.920 --> 10:17.760
that any professor, a college professor, I assume so since that's the only people that people get

10:17.760 --> 10:23.360
called professor. Anytime an adult professor says, yes, you and your boyfriend can stay here,

10:23.360 --> 10:31.760
you shouldn't stay there because he wants to collect your fluids. What? Why would you jump

10:31.760 --> 10:37.760
there? It's a part of some sort of experiment. I was going to say it was like a manicam set up

10:37.760 --> 10:42.640
to watch you do it, but you took it to a place. Oh, so mine is less creepy than that thing you

10:42.640 --> 10:48.800
just said. Yes, because mine's voyeurism and yours involves collecting things. Yeah, it does.

10:48.800 --> 10:54.960
Samples. You shouldn't do it for a lot of reasons. No, you're exactly right. There's cameras all

10:54.960 --> 11:01.920
over the place. The place is wired like some fucking deleted scene out of sneakers. There's

11:01.920 --> 11:09.840
lots of cams all over, nanny cams, teddy cams, camera cameras. Yeah, they hide cameras in cameras.

11:09.840 --> 11:14.880
Yeah, so you break the outer camera and you're like, haha, foiled them. What you didn't see.

11:15.520 --> 11:20.800
It's the matryoshka dolls of cameras. I probably didn't say that right, but it came from a place

11:20.800 --> 11:29.360
of ignorance. It's actually matryoshka. This guy is going to walk in at the end of summer and be

11:29.360 --> 11:35.600
like, did you enjoy my house? Did you enjoy being me for a while? And you guys will say yes, and

11:35.600 --> 11:40.560
you'll start to walk out and then he'll slam the door shut and padlock it and he'll say, hold up.

11:40.560 --> 11:43.600
And then he'll flip a switch and all the lights in the house will go off and then he'll flip on

11:43.600 --> 11:47.520
another switch and a bunch of black lights are going to come on. And then he's going to lead

11:47.520 --> 11:56.960
you through the house by the nose and point to all of the glowing, all of the iridescent detritus

11:56.960 --> 12:02.320
that you have left around the house, followed by a family circus cartoon. I know you sexed there.

12:02.320 --> 12:07.200
I know you sexed there. Twice there. Good job. I'm just saying there's no such thing as a fucking

12:07.200 --> 12:14.240
free lunch. This guy is going to jerk off to you somehow. Everyone is just looking for a chance to

12:14.240 --> 12:18.720
jerk off to you. Right. If you see a sign up in front of Quiznos, it's like free lunches.

12:19.520 --> 12:23.840
Just go ahead and assume that you're going to be like, cool. Can you do one quick favor?

12:25.360 --> 12:29.520
One quickie. Just a quick thing. You're going to do it anyway, but do it here now.

12:29.520 --> 12:35.440
This is so weird. I feel uncomfortable house sitting for anyone. Why do you feel?

12:36.720 --> 12:39.920
You're always into it. Like you're always into it beforehand because you think like.

12:40.640 --> 12:44.640
Vacation home. Yeah. You think like, Oh, this is what it's like to have like a villa or something

12:44.640 --> 12:50.000
that you go stay at, but it's not. It's like more like breaking and entering. Well, okay.

12:50.000 --> 12:53.920
You would, you go there, but like I'm, for me, it's more like an episode of wife swap,

12:53.920 --> 13:00.880
but there, but nobody else is there. So, so it's just a surviving swap. It's a surviving mother.

13:00.880 --> 13:04.720
Maybe the rest of her family died in a fire. And so they, I have swapped with her.

13:06.560 --> 13:16.160
Why? Okay. With the memories. Just walking around the house. You're like, man, this fucking sucks.

13:16.160 --> 13:21.440
I can see how this would have been a pretty good scene pre-fire, but this place is like a

13:21.440 --> 13:26.720
museum to her sadness. These rooms are locked. I can look through the keyhole and just see dusty

13:26.720 --> 13:33.920
rocking horses. This is terrible. I want to fuck in here. I'm going to fuck in here and recite lines

13:33.920 --> 13:40.800
from ordinary people. This is going to be great. Next week, I'm going to have the best scene study

13:40.800 --> 13:45.360
class of my life. My sense of memory is fucking topped off. It's out of control. I'm feeling this.

13:46.080 --> 13:50.400
Let's Griffin, let's talk about something less upsetting. If you want to take it to Yahoo,

13:50.400 --> 13:58.000
if you want to take it to Yahoo, that is not possible. This Yahoo was sent in by Addy twice.

13:58.000 --> 14:05.600
Thanks Addy. It's by Yahoo answers user country girl, 2415. It is unintelligible. She asks

14:06.720 --> 14:13.120
if a guy wants to take you for a ride in his car. Okay. So his name is Chris. He's my old, sorry,

14:13.120 --> 14:18.160
no punctuation in this entire fucking diatribe. Okay. So his name is Chris. He's my older brother's

14:18.160 --> 14:22.320
friend. And I know he knows I love him anyway. My favorite cars are convertible Mustangs. And

14:22.320 --> 14:27.680
he knew that so like a couple of months ago, he went out and bought. Also, I was considering buying

14:27.680 --> 14:34.000
one before him anyway. I really love this guy, but sadly he has a hot G who I think hates me,

14:34.000 --> 14:42.640
but whatever. Uh, but today he came up to show me hot G uh, GF. Okay. I want to stick with G.

14:42.640 --> 14:49.600
Yeah. He has a really sexy G who I think hates me, whatever. But today he came to show me his car

14:49.600 --> 14:54.000
and we have been really talking ever since he dated, started dating this gal. So anyway,

14:54.000 --> 14:58.080
his friends and my brother went for a ride in his car. Then he came back and dropped my brother off.

14:58.080 --> 15:02.640
Then my mom and family came to look at the car. Then they told him he should take me for a ride.

15:02.640 --> 15:08.640
And I was like, no way he'll drive too fast. And then he said, no, I won't. I will drive fast. Then

15:08.640 --> 15:16.080
he said, I'll take you for a ride sometime. Then left. Doesn't mean anything. This is the best

15:16.080 --> 15:23.200
short story ever. I listen, dear penthouse. I never thought it would happen. Dear penthouse.

15:23.200 --> 15:27.360
Okay. So his name is Chris. He's my older brother's friend and I know he knows I love him anyway.

15:29.040 --> 15:33.440
Listen, Vin, I know you're excited about your first time directing a Fast and Furious film.

15:33.440 --> 15:40.560
I think this whole scene you've written is going to end up on the proverbial cutting room floor.

15:41.200 --> 15:44.480
I really don't think you have any sort of dramatic motion here.

15:44.480 --> 15:48.160
It is basically just a girl almost getting in a car and then not.

15:48.880 --> 15:55.920
Listen, Luda, I appreciate what you've done for me, but I do need you to take the nitrous out.

15:56.640 --> 16:02.400
I do not like to drive fast. I live my life a 20th of a mile at a time. And it takes me a

16:02.400 --> 16:09.600
while to get there. It feels more like a Nicholas Sparks novel. I mean, she's excited about this guy.

16:09.600 --> 16:18.800
She thinks he's showing some interest by buying the car she likes best. I like the part where she

16:18.800 --> 16:23.680
says she was thinking about buying it before him, which I don't like to throw stones or cast

16:23.680 --> 16:28.880
dispersion, but based on this, I can estimate that this person's reading level is three.

16:28.880 --> 16:33.680
Three. So I doubt that they have the finances required to buy a convertible Mustang.

16:34.720 --> 16:38.560
However, I do like the logic of now that he's bought one,

16:38.560 --> 16:42.640
I will be unable to, for there is only one in the world.

16:42.640 --> 16:43.200
Sure.

16:43.200 --> 16:44.800
One in this town, maybe.

16:44.800 --> 16:46.560
Well, and also like, he knows-

16:46.560 --> 16:48.480
This is a one Mustang town.

16:48.480 --> 16:52.720
He knows she knows he loves- He knows that she loves him, right?

16:54.560 --> 16:56.960
I don't know if you guys heard that part. He's got this banging jeep.

16:56.960 --> 16:58.880
He's got the hottest jeep.

16:58.880 --> 17:02.080
Hates her fucking guts. Oh my God, does she hate her?

17:02.080 --> 17:06.320
But the jeep doesn't fit. That's what's so weird about this story for me is-

17:06.320 --> 17:06.880
We'll break it down, Justin.

17:06.880 --> 17:14.960
If I understand this correctly. Okay, so Stephanie loves this car.

17:14.960 --> 17:17.040
Uh-huh. Let's be honest, Steffi.

17:17.040 --> 17:18.960
Steffi loves Mustangs.

17:18.960 --> 17:21.440
Let's be honest. Stump.

17:21.440 --> 17:22.400
Okay.

17:22.400 --> 17:23.840
Okay, stump.

17:23.840 --> 17:33.600
Okay, so Destiny loves Mustangs and then this guy who she loves and knows loves him buys a Mustang.

17:33.600 --> 17:33.840
Right.

17:34.480 --> 17:43.440
He's got a jeep that's really sort of, I would say almost a tertiary character in this particular

17:43.440 --> 17:53.920
tale. The guy shows up at Destiny's door with the Mustang that she loves and he knows she loves.

17:53.920 --> 17:54.400
Uh-huh.

17:54.400 --> 17:58.640
And he offers to give her a ride into the sunset and she says,

17:58.640 --> 18:02.080
you will drive too fast. I cannot accommodate you in this request.

18:02.080 --> 18:04.640
Justin, that's a fucking metaphor.

18:04.640 --> 18:04.960
Yeah.

18:04.960 --> 18:10.320
He's gonna drive too fast. She's afraid that the relationship will move too fast and he's like,

18:10.320 --> 18:11.840
no, it won't. It'll be fine.

18:11.840 --> 18:18.000
But she's too afraid to go and the jeep represents the star-crossed love interest that's going on

18:18.000 --> 18:19.680
here. She's the barrier.

18:19.680 --> 18:25.760
He bought the car because he knew it was her favorite car, making it the most self-serving

18:25.760 --> 18:29.680
romantic gesture in the history of all gestures.

18:29.680 --> 18:33.520
I bought that car you like, but it's also mine.

18:33.520 --> 18:34.880
The sweetest car ever.

18:34.880 --> 18:39.600
But we didn't answer the question. We just made fun of it. Does it mean anything?

18:39.600 --> 18:45.520
Of course it means something. In this crazy mixed up world where two people can barely find each

18:45.520 --> 18:51.360
other as it is, if you can bond over the love of a sweet ass Mustang, then you need to literally

18:51.360 --> 18:55.520
hop on board and go. Get out of this one horse town.

18:55.520 --> 18:59.520
I never in my youth, which I'm assuming this person is in.

18:59.520 --> 19:02.640
I think that's a bold question.

19:02.640 --> 19:07.680
I think that's a bold choice because if she were 40, this is a way better question.

19:07.680 --> 19:09.200
This is a way sadder question.

19:10.000 --> 19:16.080
But I never, and a lot of my friends in high school did it because I had a lot of, which

19:16.080 --> 19:19.920
is bizarre because I was driving an Oldsmobile Colosseum that Justin gave me shortly after

19:19.920 --> 19:20.560
it died.

19:21.200 --> 19:27.920
Justin asked me to drive around in the carcass of his rusty tauntaun.

19:27.920 --> 19:32.720
Most of Griffin's cruising in those days is like foot powered like red Flintstone.

19:32.720 --> 19:33.440
Yeah, yeah.

19:34.000 --> 19:34.880
It's a good learner, though.

19:34.880 --> 19:38.960
You learn how to fix your power steering and fix tires.

19:38.960 --> 19:44.720
You learn how to convince your dad's shady mechanic friend to give you a fake inspection

19:44.720 --> 19:50.640
sticker because there's no fucking way that any certified agency will give you one.

19:50.640 --> 19:52.160
You know what? I did that.

19:52.160 --> 19:58.960
The guy you're referring to who shall not be named told me I needed to go to Tri-State

19:58.960 --> 20:01.440
Tire and ask for a guy named Whistle.

20:01.440 --> 20:09.760
And Whistle would give, and if I asked for Whistle, he'd give me an inspection sticker.

20:09.760 --> 20:11.120
God, that dude was awesome.

20:11.120 --> 20:15.280
That dude's renegade spirit fucking inspired me as a human being.

20:16.000 --> 20:21.840
Anyway, I had a lot of automotive enthusiast friends who would like, what do you want to

20:21.840 --> 20:22.240
do tonight?

20:22.240 --> 20:23.440
Let's go driving.

20:23.440 --> 20:26.240
And whenever they'd invite me along, I'd be like, to where?

20:26.240 --> 20:27.200
To Blockbuster?

20:27.920 --> 20:32.560
If we're going to Blockbuster or Outback, just fucking pick a place and let's go to

20:32.560 --> 20:32.880
there.

20:33.760 --> 20:34.800
I just don't get that.

20:34.800 --> 20:35.920
It's a locomotion.

20:35.920 --> 20:37.200
It takes you from one point to the other.

20:37.200 --> 20:37.680
I don't get that.

20:37.680 --> 20:38.160
A to B.

20:38.800 --> 20:39.200
A to B.

20:39.200 --> 20:40.080
You know what, Griffin?

20:40.080 --> 20:41.840
It's not about the destination.

20:41.840 --> 20:43.360
It's about the journey.

20:43.360 --> 20:44.080
Exactly.

20:44.080 --> 20:48.480
Yeah, and when you saw one pair of footprints, that was me walking away from your offer to

20:48.480 --> 20:49.600
go driving because it sounded like-

20:49.600 --> 20:53.040
Because I was afraid you'd do it too fast and I was worried about your GIF.

20:53.040 --> 20:53.280
Yeah.

20:54.880 --> 20:57.040
You know, the Blockbuster closed here.

20:57.040 --> 20:59.120
Yeah, it closed like a decade ago.

20:59.120 --> 21:01.120
It probably because you stole so many fucking-

21:01.120 --> 21:01.360
It was built.

21:01.360 --> 21:04.000
Probably because you stole so many video cassettes from them.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.920
Did you think about that, Justin?

21:05.920 --> 21:07.120
They b- to what?

21:07.120 --> 21:11.920
You ever look at that box that you have full of stolen video cassette tapes in the Blockbuster

21:11.920 --> 21:13.520
video and think, I'm sorry, old friend.

21:14.400 --> 21:15.040
You gave me-

21:15.040 --> 21:16.640
I changed your lifeblood.

21:16.640 --> 21:22.080
You gave me employ at a very hungry time in my life and I have betrayed you in this manner.

21:23.680 --> 21:29.840
They built the Blockbuster on the same spot where they tore down Ronald's cheese corner

21:29.840 --> 21:33.520
and now Blockbuster's closed, so I don't know if that's a net loss or what.

21:34.800 --> 21:36.080
Hey, here's another question.

21:36.080 --> 21:40.320
My girlfriend and I both have our five-year high school reunions this year.

21:40.320 --> 21:44.480
When this came up in recent conversation, she implied that she intended to bring me to hers.

21:44.480 --> 21:49.440
This surprised me because I was under the impression that you only bring people with

21:49.440 --> 21:51.920
whom you are not in very serious relationships, i.e-

21:51.920 --> 21:53.600
No, with whom you are.

21:53.600 --> 21:56.400
With whom you are in very serious relationships.

21:56.400 --> 21:58.240
I- Sorry, it's my first day reading.

21:58.240 --> 21:58.720
I.e.

21:58.720 --> 22:02.240
Fiancés and wives to high school reunions.

22:02.240 --> 22:04.960
This is not to say we aren't in a serious relationship.

22:04.960 --> 22:07.040
We've been dating for almost a year and a half.

22:07.040 --> 22:12.160
Plan to move in together ASAP, but I'm not sure what's culturally acceptable.

22:12.160 --> 22:13.840
What's the right move here, brothers?

22:13.840 --> 22:18.960
If I do go, any dos and don'ts, to go or not to go?

22:18.960 --> 22:20.880
Well, we're going to make this one real easy for you.

22:21.440 --> 22:24.880
If she says you're going, you're going.

22:24.880 --> 22:25.360
You're going.

22:25.360 --> 22:26.080
Well, there.

22:26.080 --> 22:27.280
I mean, how's that?

22:27.280 --> 22:28.160
Don't make it-

22:28.160 --> 22:29.840
It's dudes and ladies.

22:29.840 --> 22:31.120
This is not a gender-

22:31.120 --> 22:35.840
Okay, because it just fucking quickly took a sharp veer towards Jeff Fox.

22:35.840 --> 22:39.680
No, no, no, this is not like because you're wrapped around your little finger in your whip

22:39.680 --> 22:40.400
kind of thing.

22:40.400 --> 22:41.920
This is not a Ray Romano event.

22:41.920 --> 22:49.600
I'm saying if the person in your relationship says, will you be the metric of quality by

22:49.600 --> 22:55.520
which my current life will be judged as opposed to my high school life, and you say no-

22:55.520 --> 22:58.960
I don't believe it's culturally acceptable for me to go, honey.

22:58.960 --> 23:01.600
Sorry, I'd love to, but it's such a faux pas.

23:01.600 --> 23:06.000
I'm going to check the mores, but I'm pretty sure that I can't be that yardstick for you.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.760
What's next, white after Labor Day?

23:07.760 --> 23:08.720
Come on.

23:08.720 --> 23:13.920
I think you go, because I have not been to my reunion yet.

23:13.920 --> 23:15.440
Fuck, it's coming up, ain't it?

23:16.560 --> 23:22.240
Anyway, I haven't been to my reunion yet, but when I do, I don't know.

23:22.240 --> 23:25.680
I'm not going to see any of those fucking people ever again, you know?

23:25.680 --> 23:31.280
A lot of them probably don't know who I was, because I fucking skirted it at high school,

23:31.280 --> 23:35.200
by which I mean I was on the outskirts of not that I was chasing skirts.

23:35.200 --> 23:41.600
Like, I'm just going to fucking live it up, because you get one chance, you know what I mean?

23:42.720 --> 23:44.160
I didn't go to mine, so I don't know what you mean.

23:44.160 --> 23:48.560
Here's the bigger thing, because I just went to my tenure, and I'll say this.

23:48.560 --> 23:54.000
You go with her, she'll go with you, because you need all the help you can get to get through

23:54.000 --> 23:59.040
some of the situations you'll be put in, namely not remembering who any of those people are.

23:59.760 --> 24:03.360
And so you need a partner there to do the introduction game with,

24:03.360 --> 24:05.280
and so that way you can remember their names.

24:05.280 --> 24:08.640
I do get what this person is saying though, because how long have they been dating?

24:08.640 --> 24:09.120
A year?

24:10.160 --> 24:11.120
That's long enough.

24:11.120 --> 24:17.840
Like, I have been in that position before where you are at a group function with somebody you

24:17.840 --> 24:19.360
have not been dating very long.

24:19.360 --> 24:25.040
They know everybody there, you know nobody, and every time you are introduced it is,

24:25.040 --> 24:26.560
because it's like, how do you guys know each other?

24:26.560 --> 24:28.000
But, oh, we've been dating for three weeks.

24:28.560 --> 24:31.200
And they get that look in their eye like, then why the fuck did you bring them?

24:31.200 --> 24:32.960
Yeah, why are you here?

24:32.960 --> 24:34.000
Why did you agree to come?

24:34.000 --> 24:35.520
This is a social violation.

24:36.880 --> 24:41.760
I think a better question is, why would anyone go to their five-year high school reunion?

24:41.760 --> 24:44.720
I know, I saw you guys last fucking week.

24:44.720 --> 24:45.200
Yeah, right?

24:45.200 --> 24:46.880
Like, hey, what have you guys been up to?

24:46.880 --> 24:48.560
Oh, I just graduated college.

24:48.560 --> 24:50.720
Or, oh, I didn't go to college.

24:50.720 --> 24:52.160
Well, have you done anything?

24:52.160 --> 24:54.000
No, I'm like 23.

24:54.640 --> 24:56.240
Cool, cool, good check-in.

24:56.240 --> 24:57.840
See you guys in five years when it matters.

24:57.840 --> 24:59.840
I just found out about IKEA, which is pretty cool.

24:59.840 --> 25:03.600
I've just been catching up on Amazing Grace.

25:03.600 --> 25:08.320
In 20 years, this will not, like, reunions will not exist.

25:08.320 --> 25:14.880
There is no way, five, 10, I mean, it's crazy to me that we're even like, if I wanted, listen,

25:14.880 --> 25:22.240
it's 2013, if I wanted to even, like, vaguely keep tabs on you, then I would.

25:22.240 --> 25:25.520
I would know who you are and who you're balling and everything.

25:25.520 --> 25:26.560
This is gonna be fun.

25:26.560 --> 25:30.800
I'm gonna go to my high school reunion right now, and that is the group

25:30.800 --> 25:33.440
on Facebook called Huntington High School Class of 2005.

25:34.560 --> 25:38.000
It has gotten to a certain point in technology where I have to actively

25:38.000 --> 25:40.640
work to not know things about people.

25:40.640 --> 25:41.200
Jesus Christ.

25:41.200 --> 25:41.440
Yeah.

25:43.840 --> 25:45.680
That's a way you gotta treat your reunion.

25:45.680 --> 25:51.680
Like, from now on, you have to treat it like trailers for a movie you're really excited

25:51.680 --> 25:51.920
about.

25:51.920 --> 25:54.560
Like, no, no, no, I can't be friends with you on Facebook.

25:54.560 --> 25:55.440
I'm saving it all up.

25:55.440 --> 25:57.600
I really wanna be surprised when you're dead.

25:57.600 --> 25:57.920
Or when you're married.

25:57.920 --> 25:59.280
Of course I know you have a kid.

25:59.280 --> 26:00.880
Ah, damn it, spoilers.

26:00.880 --> 26:02.320
I spoiled it for myself.

26:03.360 --> 26:04.880
Wow, has it been that long?

26:04.880 --> 26:05.200
Yep.

26:05.840 --> 26:06.960
It has been that long.

26:07.600 --> 26:09.520
It has been seven years, to be precise.

26:10.240 --> 26:11.040
You guys remember?

26:11.600 --> 26:11.920
Nope.

26:12.720 --> 26:13.040
Nope.

26:14.000 --> 26:14.720
No, I do not.

26:16.640 --> 26:18.240
Do you hear about Mr. Stinkins?

26:19.040 --> 26:20.240
I did not hear about him.

26:21.040 --> 26:21.840
I did not.

26:21.840 --> 26:24.560
He taught me good about algebra, though, I guess.

26:24.560 --> 26:30.480
I don't really remember much about it, but he ended up sprees, so that was nice.

26:31.040 --> 26:33.040
I went to Sydney's reunion.

26:34.800 --> 26:35.600
It was something.

26:36.880 --> 26:38.480
Is that all you got in the chamber?

26:38.480 --> 26:39.840
That's all I got!

26:39.840 --> 26:43.440
She was so excited because, like, things had been going pretty well for her.

26:43.440 --> 26:49.280
And so she was gonna show everybody, and, like, we get there and she realizes that, like,

26:49.280 --> 26:55.040
the only people that are there are kind of disasters.

26:55.040 --> 26:59.920
It's not really like, you know, I trumped the quarterback.

27:01.520 --> 27:06.480
She did have that portion of people at hers that I knew that had gotten, like,

27:07.920 --> 27:09.920
that had had a bad term.

27:09.920 --> 27:17.440
But you'll be surprised at how little traction you can get out of capitalizing on pleasure

27:17.440 --> 27:19.040
from others' misfortune.

27:19.040 --> 27:21.680
That is despite, despite.

27:21.680 --> 27:23.280
Oh, you live here at the high school.

27:23.280 --> 27:24.000
Oh, in the gym.

27:25.680 --> 27:27.920
You haunt it like the Phantom of the Opera.

27:27.920 --> 27:30.080
Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.

27:30.080 --> 27:30.960
Where's your nest?

27:30.960 --> 27:32.000
Underneath the bleachers.

27:32.000 --> 27:33.200
Awesome, awesome, awesome.

27:33.200 --> 27:37.760
If there are two things in this world that I despise.

27:39.440 --> 27:43.200
Sorry, I meant to say love, and then this whole thing is gonna be sarcastic, but let's cut through

27:43.200 --> 27:43.700
the bullshit.

27:43.700 --> 27:50.740
It is trying to remember people's names whom I do not know, and they do know me, and also

27:51.860 --> 27:55.940
telling people what I do for a living, and then having to explain to them that yes,

27:55.940 --> 27:57.140
it is indeed a real job.

27:58.820 --> 28:04.100
And it sounds like my high school reunion is just gonna be an evening of that.

28:04.900 --> 28:13.140
Yep, just a whole, you know, whenever I describe my living to norms, I always end up saying,

28:13.140 --> 28:18.900
you know, like Roger Ebert, but for video games, which is like, which is okay.

28:18.900 --> 28:19.700
You sell out.

28:20.260 --> 28:22.180
Every sentence is a sellout you make.

28:22.180 --> 28:23.060
Just the worst.

28:24.020 --> 28:26.980
What I realized going to mine is because I think I have a really cool job.

28:26.980 --> 28:30.820
I work in professional theater and everything, but what I realized is the people that went

28:30.820 --> 28:35.380
to the reunion, and some of them I really love, and they're like actual friends of mine,

28:35.380 --> 28:36.820
they don't think it's cool.

28:36.820 --> 28:38.580
They think what they do is cool.

28:38.580 --> 28:41.780
You know, it's like nobody's gonna sit there and go, holy shit, really?

28:41.780 --> 28:42.980
That's amazing.

28:42.980 --> 28:44.020
My job's bullshit.

28:44.020 --> 28:45.300
Your job's awesome.

28:45.300 --> 28:48.180
Like, because everybody else is going to the reunion for the same reason.

28:48.180 --> 28:54.020
Right, because if they did fucking live at the high school and worked at Arby's, not

28:54.020 --> 28:55.620
that there's anything wrong with working at Arby's.

28:55.620 --> 28:57.780
If you work at Arby's, thank you for your service.

28:58.660 --> 29:04.340
But if they work at Arby's, which is a fucking clown job, then they're not gonna go to the

29:04.340 --> 29:05.220
fucking reunion.

29:05.940 --> 29:10.500
Yeah, no one is gonna play the foil to your little power fantasy.

29:10.500 --> 29:13.540
I know I shouldn't go to the reunion.

29:13.540 --> 29:16.260
I know I'm gonna be consistently embarrassed the whole time.

29:16.260 --> 29:17.780
But Travis needs this.

29:17.780 --> 29:20.020
But Travis really needs this.

29:20.020 --> 29:21.780
I was sort of a bully too in high school.

29:21.780 --> 29:23.060
It's the least I can do.

29:23.060 --> 29:26.580
Guys, what you don't understand is I just get enjoyment out of the smile on my children's

29:26.580 --> 29:27.060
face.

29:27.060 --> 29:31.700
It's not about how successful I am, but for Travis, Travis will be empty if I'm not there.

29:31.700 --> 29:32.980
Do your due diligence.

29:32.980 --> 29:38.180
Do your 10 minutes at the real reunion, then come back upstairs to the old Mr. Stinkerson

29:38.180 --> 29:45.540
science room at the Arby's to the 10-year Arby's reunion, which is where you'll stay

29:45.540 --> 29:46.420
for the rest of the night.

29:46.980 --> 29:51.140
I wish that you had to agree to that in high school.

29:51.780 --> 29:55.060
Listen, everyone talked about it, and you've been kind of a dick.

29:55.060 --> 29:58.180
Yeah, no, 1999.

29:58.180 --> 30:00.660
Okay, but listen, you have to go to the reunion.

30:00.660 --> 30:01.940
No matter what.

30:01.940 --> 30:02.820
Legally sweet.

30:02.820 --> 30:04.820
Yeah, but would not, especially in my life.

30:06.260 --> 30:07.060
Has to go.

30:07.060 --> 30:07.940
Has to be there.

30:07.940 --> 30:12.020
I hope that at my reunion, they wheel everybody out like a debutante's ball, and as they walk

30:12.020 --> 30:16.660
into the room, they announce every fucking detail of your life for the past 10 years.

30:16.660 --> 30:19.460
Your mistakes, your follies, your successes.

30:20.500 --> 30:23.780
Michael has been in three hit and runs in three years.

30:24.900 --> 30:27.300
DUIs, don't get him started.

30:30.100 --> 30:34.260
Antoine lost 100 pounds, then he gained 200.

30:36.100 --> 30:37.300
Here's a great idea.

30:37.300 --> 30:42.260
If you look forward to your reunion, instead, why don't you call all the people you were

30:42.260 --> 30:44.820
friends with in high school and just like hang out with them?

30:44.820 --> 30:46.980
Have a second reunion.

30:46.980 --> 30:48.820
Hey, Steve, I haven't seen you in a while.

30:48.820 --> 30:53.140
Let's grab a drink while I'm in town, and don't fucking go to the actual reunion.

30:53.140 --> 30:58.100
But then what if old Cindy Lou is there?

30:58.100 --> 30:59.860
Well, not Cindy Lou, because that's the girl.

30:59.860 --> 31:01.060
That's the girl from the Grinch.

31:01.780 --> 31:02.660
What is Cindy Lou?

31:02.660 --> 31:03.220
Who is there?

31:03.220 --> 31:03.620
What if Darren is there?

31:03.620 --> 31:05.300
And now she's 22.

31:05.300 --> 31:08.260
Remember Darren that you used to flirt with in cooking class?

31:08.260 --> 31:08.980
What if he's there?

31:10.340 --> 31:11.300
Remember Mikhail?

31:12.580 --> 31:14.420
Remember Mikhail and his navy?

31:18.660 --> 31:20.900
And Tom Arnold's there, and he's looking good.

31:20.900 --> 31:24.420
Yeah, Mikhail always showed off his navy, and he would always...

31:24.420 --> 31:25.620
Remember your friend Hogan?

31:25.620 --> 31:26.740
He had all those heroes.

31:28.820 --> 31:29.780
Oh, and who's that?

31:29.780 --> 31:32.500
It's the old F Troop gang hanging out on the bleachers again.

31:33.220 --> 31:34.100
What a weird...

31:34.100 --> 31:35.300
There's Demi Gillis.

31:35.300 --> 31:36.820
He always has his tail to tell.

31:40.100 --> 31:42.340
I'm so glad I went to high school at Nick at Night.

31:44.740 --> 31:46.020
Come at night on our door.

31:47.140 --> 31:48.420
It's winter to a school.

31:50.820 --> 31:55.060
And you go to school, and then you learn Three's Company High.

31:59.940 --> 32:00.580
Oh, man.

32:02.020 --> 32:03.220
Fuck I miss John Ritter.

32:03.220 --> 32:04.660
I miss John Ritter every day.

32:04.660 --> 32:05.620
Every goddamn day.

32:06.260 --> 32:09.940
Can we go to the Money Zone with the hopes that we will raise enough money

32:09.940 --> 32:13.540
to invent the science to make John Ritter come back to life?

32:25.940 --> 32:27.700
Trav, who's this first message for?

32:27.700 --> 32:28.580
This is for Tom.

32:29.460 --> 32:29.860
Tom?

32:30.500 --> 32:30.740
Yeah.

32:30.740 --> 32:34.420
Yeah, wait, is this the Tom that knows Peter and Matt?

32:34.420 --> 32:34.980
Yes, it is.

32:35.780 --> 32:40.980
And they would like to wish Tom a happy 21st birthday for Monday, the 25th of March,

32:40.980 --> 32:42.980
which we might have missed.

32:42.980 --> 32:44.100
But happy birthday.

32:44.100 --> 32:45.380
Man, I bet they were psyched.

32:45.380 --> 32:46.420
Monday, it happened.

32:46.420 --> 32:47.620
It finally aligned.

32:47.620 --> 32:49.940
Monday's when the bim-bams come out, and that's his birthday.

32:50.980 --> 32:52.260
And then we blew it.

32:52.260 --> 32:52.820
We blew it.

32:53.700 --> 32:57.300
Tom's awesome at piano and does web things and stuff,

32:57.300 --> 32:59.540
and we're just really into Tom right now.

32:59.540 --> 33:00.900
Have you heard the new Tom?

33:01.860 --> 33:06.260
Yeah, he's not quite as mainstream as a Jim or a Dave.

33:06.260 --> 33:08.980
So I just think it's a little indie right now.

33:08.980 --> 33:10.580
I'm really into indie Tom.

33:10.580 --> 33:11.380
Oh, man.

33:11.380 --> 33:14.100
His old stuff is way better than his new stuff.

33:14.100 --> 33:14.820
I agree.

33:14.820 --> 33:16.980
Before he went all corporate.

33:16.980 --> 33:19.780
While we're on the subject, well, it's not really the subject,

33:19.780 --> 33:21.300
but it's close enough, quick retraction.

33:21.300 --> 33:26.100
I hate to derail our Money Zone flow, but quick retraction, quick correction.

33:26.100 --> 33:28.740
That new Justin Timberlake album is fucking off the chains.

33:28.740 --> 33:31.380
And I think two or three episodes ago, I said it was...

33:32.580 --> 33:33.540
I said it was bunko.

33:34.100 --> 33:35.300
I think it's my exact words.

33:35.300 --> 33:36.660
And it is the dopest.

33:36.660 --> 33:38.260
I set my ringtone to push her love, girl.

33:38.260 --> 33:39.620
I can't fucking get enough.

33:39.620 --> 33:42.020
Anyway, that's just a quick retraction.

33:42.020 --> 33:44.420
Can you assure me that you will edit that part

33:44.420 --> 33:47.540
and place it at a more appropriate juncture in the show?

33:47.540 --> 33:47.780
Yeah.

33:47.780 --> 33:49.060
A more relevant juncture?

33:49.060 --> 33:49.700
We just need to make sure that-

33:49.700 --> 33:50.980
Maybe put it in the Money Zone.

33:50.980 --> 33:52.260
Put it in the Money Zone.

33:52.260 --> 33:54.100
In 20 minutes from now, we just need to make sure

33:54.100 --> 33:57.140
that we very fluidly talk about Justin Timberlake.

33:57.140 --> 33:57.700
Okay.

33:57.700 --> 34:00.180
Hey, I want everybody to go to Axe Cop Wedding.

34:00.180 --> 34:02.580
We're gonna help Ethan fund his wedding.

34:02.580 --> 34:03.700
Now, who's Ethan, you ask?

34:03.700 --> 34:08.820
Well, the Axe Cop is, as you know, a webcomic written by an eight-year-old

34:08.820 --> 34:10.900
and drawn by his 32-year-old brother.

34:10.900 --> 34:13.300
They've been creating it since they were five and 29

34:13.300 --> 34:16.260
and have produced four graphic novels with Dark Horse Comics

34:16.260 --> 34:17.860
and have a TV show that works at Fox.

34:18.420 --> 34:20.500
Ethan, the older brother, is getting married

34:20.500 --> 34:23.780
and is doing a campaign to sell artwork to raise money for his wedding.

34:23.780 --> 34:25.380
He's selling exclusive print.

34:25.380 --> 34:32.420
There's a sketchbook and there's lots of other items, Axe Cop Wedding.com.

34:32.420 --> 34:33.140
So we're gonna-

34:33.140 --> 34:34.660
If you guys have not checked out Axe Cop-

34:34.660 --> 34:40.580
Guys, Axe Cop, I can't remember when I first got involved

34:40.580 --> 34:46.020
when I started doing Axe Cop, but goddamn, it is so good.

34:47.140 --> 34:47.780
It's the best.

34:48.340 --> 34:53.460
Obviously, you want to get over to Axe Cop Wedding.com and help Ethan out,

34:53.460 --> 34:58.420
but also get something for yourself in the process

34:58.420 --> 35:02.740
because obviously altruism is an illusion

35:03.700 --> 35:08.420
and you, too, can help Axe Cop get married.

35:08.420 --> 35:09.780
But not just you, too.

35:09.780 --> 35:11.300
You can also do it.

35:11.300 --> 35:13.940
Yeah, don't leave all the goodness to you, too.

35:13.940 --> 35:14.820
They have done enough.

35:14.820 --> 35:17.140
Listen, Bono already does so much for us.

35:17.140 --> 35:18.340
He does so much for us.

35:18.340 --> 35:21.060
Hey, I want to wish a very happy birthday to Cory and Atchison.

35:21.060 --> 35:24.020
And I hope you're enjoying it.

35:25.220 --> 35:29.060
And that comes to us from a mysterious,

35:30.180 --> 35:33.540
very dedicated MBMBA and listening partner,

35:34.180 --> 35:37.060
Corrin, I hope you know who we're referring to.

35:37.060 --> 35:40.100
Otherwise, you are probably about to be killed.

35:40.100 --> 35:40.980
Oh my God.

35:42.180 --> 35:43.860
Look behind you, Corrin!

35:43.860 --> 35:46.580
Oh, the spookiest Money Zone message.

35:47.540 --> 35:48.180
Very spook-

35:48.180 --> 35:51.220
Well, it's the spookiest Money Zone message.

35:51.220 --> 35:54.340
Corrin's very, very happy birthday was the spookiest

35:54.340 --> 36:00.420
until this next one when we talk about things to put down there.

36:01.060 --> 36:02.420
Hold on one second, guys.

36:02.420 --> 36:02.980
Okay.

36:02.980 --> 36:06.180
I just got an email from James saying Sexy Garfield is compromised.

36:06.900 --> 36:07.140
No!

36:07.140 --> 36:07.780
Son of a bitch!

36:08.340 --> 36:09.140
Yeah.

36:09.140 --> 36:10.900
Who keeps fucking leaking our shit?

36:11.940 --> 36:12.900
Our shit's leaked!

36:14.100 --> 36:15.620
I will say this, though.

36:15.620 --> 36:19.380
I really enjoy saying the phrase Sexy Garfield is compromised.

36:19.380 --> 36:23.140
It makes me feel like Robert Redford in Spy Games.

36:23.140 --> 36:25.220
This is still in the show, right?

36:25.220 --> 36:26.820
I mean, we're still making our show right now?

36:26.820 --> 36:27.220
Yeah.

36:27.220 --> 36:27.700
Yeah.

36:27.700 --> 36:28.260
Okay.

36:28.260 --> 36:29.220
Holy shit.

36:29.220 --> 36:30.020
This is fucking-

36:30.020 --> 36:32.180
We need to get fucking Angelina Jolie.

36:32.180 --> 36:33.540
We need to get Devin Salwa.

36:33.540 --> 36:34.420
Was he in Hackers?

36:35.700 --> 36:37.620
Was Devin Salwa in Hackers?

36:37.620 --> 36:38.660
Was I in Hackers?

36:40.580 --> 36:42.580
Um, we need to get them on the fucking case.

36:42.580 --> 36:44.260
We need to swordfish this fuck.

36:44.260 --> 36:46.340
Who- Hey, fuck!

36:46.340 --> 36:50.340
If you're listening to this show and you're leaking all our fucking coupons to coupon sites,

36:50.900 --> 36:54.660
hey Coupon Hog, can you fucking chill on it for a second, please?

36:55.620 --> 37:00.180
Give us a two-week head start to get these coupons out there before you start hogging them all.

37:00.180 --> 37:00.580
You fuck.

37:00.580 --> 37:01.940
Just leave our coups alone.

37:01.940 --> 37:04.340
How do you think that they figure out that it's been compromised?

37:04.340 --> 37:08.100
Do you think they get like a billion dildo requests with that coupon on it?

37:08.100 --> 37:09.220
And they're like, holy shit.

37:10.180 --> 37:12.660
I don't know what the McElroy brothers said on the last podcast,

37:12.660 --> 37:15.060
but it got people lubed and tubed.

37:16.820 --> 37:19.460
Uh, maybe it should be some sort of clue.

37:19.460 --> 37:20.980
Maybe the problem is we're saying it.

37:20.980 --> 37:21.460
Oh my god.

37:21.460 --> 37:23.940
And someone's got like scanners on the show.

37:23.940 --> 37:24.180
Okay.

37:24.900 --> 37:28.580
Maybe they need to get like, you know what I'm saying right now?

37:28.580 --> 37:30.340
Okay, so I'm gonna tap it out in Morse code.

37:30.340 --> 37:31.140
Arebus.

37:31.140 --> 37:32.500
Arebus, perhaps.

37:32.500 --> 37:33.700
Arebus, okay.

37:35.380 --> 37:36.500
What's our new code gonna be?

37:36.500 --> 37:37.620
This is making me so angry.

37:38.740 --> 37:40.820
Well, while we think of it, let's talk about what the site is.

37:40.820 --> 37:46.660
It's a site for sexual products of so many kinds.

37:46.660 --> 37:49.220
Real sexy.

37:49.220 --> 37:55.220
If you have two to three go-to positions, that is clown sex.

37:55.220 --> 37:57.380
You need to spice up your life.

37:57.380 --> 38:04.820
And the way that you do that is with, you know, a rod or a pouch or, uh, you know,

38:04.820 --> 38:09.220
metal spheres or some kind of salve.

38:09.220 --> 38:11.620
Like, all of these things are, but they're sex themed.

38:11.620 --> 38:13.620
They sell them on Extreme Restraints.

38:13.620 --> 38:18.820
Otherwise, you've just described all the simple mechanisms as described by Play-Doh.

38:18.820 --> 38:21.620
I've described all of the clue murder weapons.

38:22.900 --> 38:30.420
ExtremeRestraints.com is an adult superstore that I have been to so many times.

38:31.060 --> 38:37.300
I am no longer offended or even moved by pictures of dicks.

38:37.300 --> 38:39.540
Or welcome in the public library.

38:39.540 --> 38:44.980
I am no longer, but the same thing has happened with boobs.

38:44.980 --> 38:48.580
I can't feel anything.

38:51.140 --> 38:58.660
So I got a one-fit elastic ball stretcher for $7.95 and I sure as fuck felt that.

38:58.660 --> 39:00.900
This is how people get into this stuff.

39:00.900 --> 39:06.260
They stop feeling things from looking at pictures of boobs, booberoobs, and ding-dongs.

39:06.260 --> 39:06.820
Yeah.

39:06.820 --> 39:08.660
And then they need to stretch them out.

39:08.660 --> 39:12.180
I can only get turned on by fire hydrant sex now.

39:12.180 --> 39:13.780
That's the only thing that does it for me.

39:14.740 --> 39:17.060
And do you guys, you guys know about that, right?

39:17.060 --> 39:18.020
Oh, yeah.

39:18.020 --> 39:19.220
I don't think I've heard about that one.

39:20.900 --> 39:21.860
Oh, man.

39:23.780 --> 39:26.500
It's even hard for me to talk about it without chubbing up.

39:26.500 --> 39:36.660
It's when you, you put a, you put a pair of sunglasses on a fire hydrant jerk off on it.

39:39.060 --> 39:40.500
They have a wide selection.

39:40.500 --> 39:41.620
It's not just sex toys.

39:41.620 --> 39:44.900
You've got to put the sunglasses on it though, because it personifies it.

39:44.900 --> 39:45.300
You know what I mean?

39:45.300 --> 39:46.500
Otherwise it's just weird.

39:47.380 --> 39:48.660
They've got a, they've got-

39:48.660 --> 39:49.460
What does that guy do?

39:49.460 --> 39:50.420
Oh, it's got sunglasses.

39:50.420 --> 39:50.900
That's fine.

39:50.900 --> 39:51.380
Nevermind.

39:51.380 --> 39:51.620
It's a person.

39:51.620 --> 39:53.940
It looks like a little, it looks like a little red person.

39:53.940 --> 39:56.580
It's a person disguised as a fire hydrant.

39:57.140 --> 40:00.340
They got uniforms, if you want that.

40:00.340 --> 40:02.660
They've got a tank top that says police on it.

40:02.660 --> 40:04.980
You know, like police are always wearing.

40:04.980 --> 40:07.860
And there's also one that says fireman.

40:07.860 --> 40:11.060
And there's also a tank top and a belly shirt.

40:11.060 --> 40:12.420
Yeah, I'll wear that fireman one.

40:12.420 --> 40:13.940
I'll wear that fireman one.

40:13.940 --> 40:15.380
And then people don't ask questions.

40:15.380 --> 40:17.140
Like that's a weird looking fireman.

40:17.140 --> 40:18.420
I don't think he's doing that right.

40:18.420 --> 40:19.860
And why is that hydrant wearing sunglasses?

40:19.860 --> 40:22.820
Oh, he looks so cut.

40:22.820 --> 40:24.740
They don't have a video game blogger uniform.

40:24.740 --> 40:27.860
So I don't really know what to say about that.

40:27.860 --> 40:29.700
They, oh, they also have erotic art.

40:29.700 --> 40:31.540
If you don't want to put your dick in something,

40:31.540 --> 40:33.300
you just want to put your eyes on it.

40:33.300 --> 40:33.940
They got that.

40:33.940 --> 40:36.260
You don't want to make your house guests think about

40:36.260 --> 40:37.780
putting their dicks in something.

40:37.780 --> 40:41.540
You can only have that if you are super, super, super rich.

40:41.540 --> 40:44.180
And you have a lot of really big windows.

40:44.180 --> 40:47.300
And also the erotic art is like the only decoration

40:47.300 --> 40:48.660
you have in your house whatsoever.

40:48.660 --> 40:54.260
How many zeros have to come out in your paycheck

40:54.260 --> 40:58.740
before you can have a sculpture called sexual exploration

40:58.740 --> 41:00.660
and don't raise an eyebrow?

41:00.660 --> 41:02.580
Like how rich does that have to be?

41:04.260 --> 41:07.700
How rich do you have to be to have a hung tied girl sculpture

41:08.260 --> 41:09.940
that costs $249?

41:09.940 --> 41:13.460
Of course you can save 20% with the coupon code

41:13.460 --> 41:16.980
not sexy Garfield because that got fucking compromised.

41:16.980 --> 41:17.220
Fuck.

41:17.220 --> 41:17.780
What about this?

41:17.780 --> 41:20.260
What about this leaky coupon?

41:21.220 --> 41:22.180
Leaky coupon.

41:22.180 --> 41:23.460
That's a little unerotic.

41:24.260 --> 41:25.540
It's not very erotic.

41:25.540 --> 41:27.540
How about fuck coupon sites?

41:27.540 --> 41:28.100
Yeah.

41:28.100 --> 41:29.940
And that way if it leaks, they're like, oh, that stinks.

41:29.940 --> 41:30.980
Do you guys think it's China?

41:32.500 --> 41:34.900
Cause China fucking hacked the New York Times

41:34.900 --> 41:36.660
and I think that we might be next.

41:36.660 --> 41:37.620
Maybe it's anonymous.

41:37.620 --> 41:38.820
And by next, I mean last.

41:38.820 --> 41:41.060
Cause we already got, we already got hit a couple of times.

41:41.060 --> 41:43.460
Why don't we use the coupon code Westboro?

41:45.300 --> 41:46.020
That would be good.

41:46.020 --> 41:50.020
W-E-S-T-B-O-R-O.

41:50.020 --> 41:51.460
Do you think that would, that would work out?

41:51.460 --> 41:53.860
You save 20% using the coupon code Westboro.

41:54.980 --> 41:55.620
Ira Ray.

41:56.900 --> 42:00.180
Wouldn't that, what better thank you could there be?

42:01.220 --> 42:04.020
Yeah, but then, but then like, I don't know.

42:04.020 --> 42:08.180
People are gonna jerk off while thinking about Ira Ray.

42:09.300 --> 42:10.260
Like they don't already?

42:12.180 --> 42:13.700
How about maximum chub?

42:13.700 --> 42:14.200
Chub.

42:15.540 --> 42:20.340
Cause it sounds like our name and like chub is like, it's, it's a.

42:20.340 --> 42:20.900
Sure.

42:20.900 --> 42:22.500
Chub is like, you know what I mean?

42:22.500 --> 42:23.940
Chub is like a power word.

42:23.940 --> 42:25.060
It's like a dragon shout.

42:26.420 --> 42:26.980
You know what I mean?

42:26.980 --> 42:28.260
How about sexy buns?

42:29.140 --> 42:30.900
Cause I feel like that does some good.

42:30.900 --> 42:32.100
Oh, here we go.

42:32.660 --> 42:34.660
This, yeah, we need to get on some grandpa shit.

42:34.660 --> 42:36.580
We need to get like tushy in it.

42:36.580 --> 42:38.020
Oh, I like that.

42:38.020 --> 42:39.540
I don't know how to spell tushy.

42:39.540 --> 42:40.340
Tushy time.

42:40.980 --> 42:42.500
How about sizzle buns?

42:42.500 --> 42:45.300
How about, how about tushy time?

42:46.500 --> 42:47.540
I don't know how to spell.

42:47.540 --> 42:49.860
T-S-H-Y time.

42:49.860 --> 42:52.420
Now see, I went I-E, so.

42:52.420 --> 42:54.100
So now we can't do that one.

42:54.100 --> 42:54.420
Okay.

42:55.220 --> 42:56.820
Tuckus, fanny.

42:56.820 --> 42:57.860
Oh, fanny's good.

42:57.860 --> 42:58.740
Fanny time.

42:59.380 --> 43:00.660
Fanny time.

43:00.660 --> 43:01.540
Fanny time.

43:01.540 --> 43:01.780
Okay.

43:02.740 --> 43:06.100
Now hold on cause this works on a few levels cause isn't fanny like

43:06.100 --> 43:08.180
a term for a vagina in the UK?

43:08.180 --> 43:08.420
Yep.

43:09.780 --> 43:10.500
I like it.

43:10.500 --> 43:10.820
Perfect.

43:10.820 --> 43:11.620
Fanny time.

43:11.620 --> 43:12.900
Fanny time.

43:12.900 --> 43:13.700
All one word.

43:13.700 --> 43:15.780
20% off if you're gonna save at streamchains.com.

43:17.220 --> 43:20.660
So use that coupon code and go get something for sex.

43:20.660 --> 43:22.980
And then keep it secret and keep it safe.

43:22.980 --> 43:24.420
Don't put it in print anywhere.

43:25.140 --> 43:26.100
Don't write it down.

43:26.100 --> 43:27.300
Don't write it down.

43:27.300 --> 43:28.420
Don't let anybody know.

43:28.420 --> 43:29.220
Keep it a secret.

43:29.220 --> 43:35.380
If you, if I see any of you motherfuckers, if I see hashtag fanny time on-

43:35.380 --> 43:37.060
If I paper trail this back to you.

43:37.060 --> 43:38.340
If I, oh my God.

43:38.340 --> 43:42.820
If I crack your IP address and I go through your proxy server

43:43.860 --> 43:46.900
and I, I will call your dad.

43:46.900 --> 43:51.620
And I see that you AOLIM somebody like, hey, check out this new coupon code fanny time.

43:51.620 --> 43:53.220
And it's like some kind of coupon.

43:53.220 --> 43:53.780
I'm gonna, I'm gonna-

43:53.780 --> 43:55.620
I'm gonna send it to you cause you don't realize the difference.

43:55.620 --> 43:58.900
I'm gonna tweet hashtag fanny time cause nothing's funnier on the internet

43:58.900 --> 44:01.940
than when somebody asks you not to do something and then you do the opposite.

44:01.940 --> 44:02.500
Oh guys.

44:02.500 --> 44:03.220
So don't be a dick.

44:03.220 --> 44:06.420
Ooh, I will come down on you with God's own fury.

44:06.980 --> 44:07.380
Oh my God.

44:07.380 --> 44:08.660
You'll be blocked from everything.

44:08.660 --> 44:10.900
We'll IP ban you from getting this show ever again.

44:10.900 --> 44:13.540
I will not pass over you with my bands.

44:14.420 --> 44:18.660
He will kill your firstborn son with his sculpture called Hogtide Girl.

44:18.660 --> 44:22.660
Your firstborn son will never even know who we are,

44:22.660 --> 44:26.180
which is probably accurate for most people listening to this show.

44:27.700 --> 44:31.380
I'm Cameron Esposito and I'm the host of Maximum Fun's new podcast,

44:31.380 --> 44:35.780
Wham Bam Pow, a sci-fi movie show and action movies.

44:35.780 --> 44:38.180
Also, did I forget to say action movies?

44:38.180 --> 44:40.100
Every week I'll be joined by Mr-

44:40.100 --> 44:40.900
Ricky Carmona.

44:40.900 --> 44:41.620
And Ms-

44:41.620 --> 44:42.420
Rhea Butcher.

44:42.420 --> 44:43.940
And we are going to chat about films.

44:43.940 --> 44:44.980
We're going to tell jokes.

44:44.980 --> 44:46.100
We're going to be hilarious.

44:46.100 --> 44:47.060
We're going to play games.

44:47.060 --> 44:48.020
We're going to have guests.

44:48.020 --> 44:49.060
We're going to give reviews.

44:49.060 --> 44:50.580
It's going to blow your mind.

44:50.580 --> 44:54.260
If you want to listen to the show, you can find it at maximumfun.org

44:54.260 --> 44:55.780
or you can subscribe on iTunes.

44:55.780 --> 44:57.700
Can you believe how many things I just listed?

44:57.700 --> 44:58.420
So many things.

45:00.180 --> 45:00.680
Wham!

45:00.680 --> 45:04.680
Wham!

45:04.680 --> 45:05.320
That's great.

45:07.160 --> 45:11.000
My fiancee and I are getting married in June

45:11.000 --> 45:14.440
and we'll be starting the process of adopting a child shortly thereafter.

45:14.440 --> 45:15.400
How nice.

45:15.400 --> 45:16.760
That's all very exciting.

45:16.760 --> 45:18.520
But one thing is already stressing me out.

45:18.520 --> 45:20.760
We have no idea what the kids should call us.

45:20.760 --> 45:23.000
Dad and dad is too confusing.

45:23.000 --> 45:26.360
Father makes it sound like I'm going to use a whistle to summon them,

45:26.360 --> 45:27.880
ala Mr.

45:27.880 --> 45:28.600
Von Tramp.

45:28.600 --> 45:31.320
I think it's Von Trap.

45:31.320 --> 45:32.520
I think it's Von Trap.

45:32.520 --> 45:34.200
Von Trap would be a way better movie.

45:34.200 --> 45:36.200
Use the coupon code Von Trap.

45:37.160 --> 45:39.960
Papa just makes it sound like I sing.

45:39.960 --> 45:41.640
I like it when you call me big papa.

45:42.200 --> 45:44.600
What are some alternatives to dad one and dad two?

45:44.600 --> 45:47.880
Or should we go full happy and just full hippy?

45:47.880 --> 45:48.380
Fuck!

45:48.840 --> 45:51.000
And just have them call us by our first names.

45:51.000 --> 45:55.080
And this is from clearly dad one in Portland.

45:55.080 --> 45:57.720
Man, you gotta, you don't even fucking realize.

45:57.720 --> 45:59.560
There is no best option.

45:59.560 --> 46:02.600
There is only a least worst option in this department.

46:02.600 --> 46:05.960
And you need to fucking get down on that land grab before he snatches it up.

46:08.040 --> 46:09.400
Seriously, is there anything?

46:10.200 --> 46:11.720
We don't have the good note.

46:11.720 --> 46:13.720
We don't have good nomenclature for this.

46:13.720 --> 46:17.560
You can have, he can call one of you Paul Reiser and the other one Greg Evigan.

46:17.560 --> 46:18.600
Can we do that?

46:18.600 --> 46:21.320
I don't even get your reference, but it sounds hateful.

46:21.320 --> 46:24.920
That's why would you ever call anyone Paul Reiser, Dustin?

46:24.920 --> 46:28.440
Because Paul Reiser and Greg Evigan were on the hit series My Two Dads.

46:28.440 --> 46:30.120
Someone really enjoyed that joke.

46:30.120 --> 46:34.760
I'm not, it was Paul Reiser listening at home.

46:34.760 --> 46:36.280
Such a treat to have you, Paul.

46:36.280 --> 46:37.960
That wasn't as mean as I thought it was going to be.

46:39.560 --> 46:41.080
I love your early live stuff.

46:42.600 --> 46:44.280
He kind of lost it later, but.

46:44.280 --> 46:46.200
Mad About You was not a bad show at all.

46:47.480 --> 46:49.800
Do you guys think him and Helen Hunt ever fucked?

46:49.800 --> 46:50.360
All the time.

46:51.640 --> 46:52.840
I bet they shared a trailer.

46:52.840 --> 46:54.200
I bet they did.

46:54.200 --> 46:56.920
This is hard for me because I know them both so well.

46:56.920 --> 46:58.920
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to put you in a place, Justin.

46:58.920 --> 47:01.240
Just have him call you, what's wrong with dad?

47:01.720 --> 47:04.840
Hey, what's wrong with dad?

47:04.840 --> 47:07.000
What about daddy and dad?

47:07.640 --> 47:12.360
And then depending on who they like better in any given moment, that person becomes daddy.

47:13.000 --> 47:13.880
I like that.

47:13.880 --> 47:16.520
Pretty sure you lifted that off an episode of Modern Family though.

47:17.480 --> 47:17.800
Really?

47:18.600 --> 47:21.400
I've never watched Modern Family, so that would be quite the feat.

47:21.400 --> 47:25.560
Yeah, I've never seen Star Wars, but wouldn't it be cool if there were swords made of light?

47:26.120 --> 47:27.160
That's you right now.

47:28.840 --> 47:30.200
I'm not telling the truth.

47:30.920 --> 47:32.840
Can I tell you guys a word about My Two Dads,

47:32.840 --> 47:35.080
since you're obviously kind of out of the loop on this one?

47:37.000 --> 47:40.360
Giovanni Ribisi was starred on this show.

47:40.360 --> 47:40.600
Okay.

47:41.160 --> 47:42.200
Here's another fact.

47:43.320 --> 47:50.840
At the top of the Wikipedia page, it says for the Scrubs episode, see My Two Dads Scrubs.

47:50.840 --> 47:55.400
So I don't know who the target demo is for this Wikipedia page,

47:56.040 --> 47:58.520
but you've accidentally stumbled on this.

47:58.520 --> 48:05.320
It is the same target audience of this goof that you are baking up in the crock pot.

48:05.320 --> 48:07.480
It only got three seasons, did you guys know that?

48:07.480 --> 48:11.640
I didn't because like remembering other things,

48:11.640 --> 48:15.080
you just booted something out of my brain that I would have preferred to keep in there,

48:15.080 --> 48:15.640
a nice recipe.

48:15.640 --> 48:20.520
Did you know, did you know that My Two Dads had a crossover with Nightcore

48:20.520 --> 48:21.560
where they're in the same verse?

48:22.760 --> 48:23.720
I did not know that.

48:23.720 --> 48:27.240
Is that like when Family Matters and Step by Step crossover?

48:27.240 --> 48:28.680
See, I know those two shows.

48:28.680 --> 48:30.360
Those are all on the same verse.

48:31.080 --> 48:31.800
That's amazing.

48:32.520 --> 48:34.360
There is a TGIF verse, right?

48:35.320 --> 48:36.520
Yeah, because there's one episode.

48:36.520 --> 48:39.080
Okay, so there was one episode where Sabrina the Teenager,

48:39.080 --> 48:42.760
the cat ate like some kind of magic hairball that transported everyone through time

48:42.760 --> 48:44.920
and he traveled through all the different shows on one night

48:44.920 --> 48:47.080
and they had like a show in the 40s and like a show in the 50s

48:47.080 --> 48:49.560
and a show in the 60s and a show in the 70s, right?

48:49.560 --> 48:50.680
Okay, yep, yep.

48:50.680 --> 48:51.240
All the things.

48:51.240 --> 48:55.720
But he also, so here, the verses are continually connected though

48:55.720 --> 49:00.120
because the Family Matters verse is linked to the Full House verse.

49:00.120 --> 49:00.920
Obviously.

49:00.920 --> 49:02.440
They're, that's in the TGIF verse.

49:02.440 --> 49:04.040
No, it's a Step by Step verse.

49:04.040 --> 49:04.440
I don't know Full House.

49:04.440 --> 49:05.480
No, no, no, no, no, no.

49:05.480 --> 49:07.000
They're in the same verse.

49:07.000 --> 49:07.480
Okay.

49:07.480 --> 49:10.280
Like Step by Step verse, Full House verse, Family Matters verse,

49:10.280 --> 49:11.720
they're all in the same, they're linked by Urkel.

49:11.720 --> 49:14.120
Do you guys remember, do you guys remember Grandpa Wabi?

49:14.120 --> 49:16.200
Because I can't remember what his face looks like now.

49:16.200 --> 49:18.280
That's, you just, you just fucking replaced that RAM.

49:18.280 --> 49:18.920
Damn.

49:18.920 --> 49:22.920
Steve Urkel is pen pals with Cory Matthews.

49:22.920 --> 49:27.640
So yes, the Boy Meets World verse is the same as the TGIF,

49:27.640 --> 49:29.000
is in the TGIF verse.

49:29.000 --> 49:33.800
Like they're all in the same verse linked by the fucking Time Walker.

49:34.520 --> 49:37.880
The one who walks between dimensions that is Steve Urkel.

49:37.880 --> 49:43.080
Steve is the thread that ties this tapestry together.

49:43.080 --> 49:45.800
Okay, I have a suggestion for the question asker.

49:45.800 --> 49:48.680
Take it a completely different direction, because your kids don't know shit.

49:48.680 --> 49:49.400
Because there's a kid.

49:49.400 --> 49:49.640
Hey.

49:50.440 --> 49:51.320
No, have them call you like-

49:51.320 --> 49:52.520
Hey, you're a fucking idiot kid.

49:53.080 --> 49:55.880
Hey, this kid that knows nothing, and you're teaching him about the world,

49:55.880 --> 49:57.880
have him call you guys like Tango and Cash.

49:58.840 --> 50:00.680
Like take it a completely different way.

50:00.680 --> 50:02.040
That's fantastic.

50:02.040 --> 50:02.360
Just like-

50:02.360 --> 50:06.840
But if the fucking social services hears your child call you guys that,

50:07.800 --> 50:08.760
where'd our kid go?

50:08.760 --> 50:11.960
There's a kid shaped puff of smoke here, where a kid once stood.

50:11.960 --> 50:14.440
This is my dad's, turn around and hooch.

50:14.440 --> 50:17.800
Nope, this is the back seat of my Volvo.

50:17.800 --> 50:19.160
I'm taking you somewhere much safer.

50:19.160 --> 50:21.720
These are my dad's, stop with my mom and shoot.

50:26.760 --> 50:28.600
This is my dad Rocky and Rocky too.

50:29.080 --> 50:30.520
I think I misunderstood your bitch.

50:30.520 --> 50:31.640
No, you nailed it.

50:31.640 --> 50:32.360
You're doing great.

50:32.360 --> 50:32.840
You did good.

50:32.840 --> 50:33.400
Got it in one.

50:33.400 --> 50:34.040
You guys want Yahoo?

50:34.680 --> 50:35.400
Yeah, please.

50:37.400 --> 50:38.680
This one's sent in by Ira Ray.

50:39.480 --> 50:40.520
Are you serious?

50:40.520 --> 50:43.320
Are you Ira Ray?

50:43.320 --> 50:44.360
Who wants to know?

50:44.360 --> 50:45.160
God damn it.

50:45.160 --> 50:46.120
I always fucking guess.

50:46.120 --> 50:48.280
It's always the one you don't do that I try for.

50:49.480 --> 50:51.720
We need to formalize this system off the air.

50:53.240 --> 50:54.040
By Yahoo Answers.

50:54.040 --> 50:54.680
Oh, thank you Ira.

50:54.680 --> 50:56.600
It's by Yahoo Answers user Daniel who asks,

50:58.280 --> 51:00.520
I accidentally sent a naked pic to my grandpa.

51:00.520 --> 51:02.200
How do I keep this from being awkward?

51:04.360 --> 51:09.000
I was texting and I accidentally sent a naked pic of myself to my grandpa.

51:09.000 --> 51:11.560
Don't fucking waste my time for repeating the headline.

51:15.400 --> 51:16.520
Is that so much to ask?

51:16.520 --> 51:18.280
It's storytelling 101.

51:18.280 --> 51:19.080
A fresh lead.

51:19.080 --> 51:20.680
I want the inverted pyramid.

51:20.680 --> 51:22.040
Why did you send a naked picture?

51:23.080 --> 51:23.880
My family is going-

51:23.880 --> 51:26.120
Tragedy struck this afternoon.

51:26.120 --> 51:27.800
Dateline, my house.

51:28.360 --> 51:29.800
He never saw it coming.

51:32.040 --> 51:35.160
My family is going to go over to his house this Monday for a family reunion.

51:35.160 --> 51:37.640
How do I keep things from being awkward between me and my grandpa?

51:37.640 --> 51:39.160
I love Daniel.

51:43.480 --> 51:47.080
Literally, the only option you have is to try to get him arrested.

51:47.640 --> 51:50.040
That is the only option you have.

51:50.040 --> 51:54.200
If you're ever going to have any semblance of a normal life again, he's gone now.

51:54.840 --> 51:57.640
God, I just had the meanest idea ever.

51:58.360 --> 51:59.000
Hit me.

51:59.000 --> 52:02.680
It's like I haven't said anything this mean in a long time.

52:02.680 --> 52:07.240
Like, since that joke I made about Lou Gehrig's disease, like, this is a top fiver.

52:09.080 --> 52:10.200
What's your idea?

52:12.600 --> 52:14.200
What if you installed-

52:15.160 --> 52:20.680
What if you, on your senile grandparent's phone, you installed Snapchat,

52:20.680 --> 52:33.640
and that was the only program you used to send them family pictures?

52:33.640 --> 52:38.440
Why would you do that to him?

52:38.440 --> 52:40.200
Look at this beautiful picture of my child.

52:40.200 --> 52:41.080
Oh, it was on here.

52:41.080 --> 52:41.400
Hold on.

52:41.400 --> 52:42.600
Hold on, I'm fine.

52:43.400 --> 52:44.360
He was at NAG's head.

52:44.360 --> 52:46.200
He was putting his head in a big fake fish.

52:46.200 --> 52:46.760
It was really-

52:46.760 --> 52:47.480
Oh, God.

52:47.480 --> 52:48.760
It was a picture of his dick.

52:48.760 --> 52:49.800
I swear to God.

52:49.800 --> 52:50.600
Hold on.

52:50.600 --> 52:54.360
No, there's a picture of him and his-

52:54.360 --> 52:55.880
I've not seen the girl he's engaged to.

52:55.880 --> 52:57.320
I thought he had a baby.

52:57.320 --> 52:58.600
I haven't met her yet.

52:58.600 --> 52:59.320
I thought he had-

52:59.320 --> 53:01.400
It was just on these darn things.

53:03.560 --> 53:07.880
My wife has just squirted off listening to our podcast ever again.

53:07.880 --> 53:10.440
She literally just threw the phone at a wall and said,

53:10.440 --> 53:12.280
fuck this show, I'm done.

53:13.320 --> 53:13.880
Oh, man.

53:15.720 --> 53:17.800
Man, is this needle-threadable, guys?

53:17.800 --> 53:20.840
It seems like one of those fucked up needles that the metal grows over.

53:20.840 --> 53:23.240
I think what you're going to have to do is fake your death.

53:23.240 --> 53:24.680
Yeah, you've got to fake your death.

53:25.800 --> 53:29.400
The last picture of you living has to be the naked picture.

53:29.400 --> 53:33.160
Time to start a new life in Sheboygan as a factory worker.

53:33.160 --> 53:34.920
You're going to have to Bruce Banner now.

53:34.920 --> 53:36.360
You got to walk the-

53:36.360 --> 53:37.160
Is it too late?

53:37.160 --> 53:42.120
Has the ship, the wacky sitcom ship of sneaking into the high school

53:42.840 --> 53:45.560
to get your failed test back, you know what I mean?

53:45.560 --> 53:46.680
Mm-hmm.

53:46.680 --> 53:48.120
Has that ship sailed?

53:48.120 --> 53:50.760
Although, inevitably, you'll be Kai if sitcoms have taught me anything.

53:51.720 --> 53:52.920
What are you doing with my phone?

53:52.920 --> 53:53.720
Let me see what you-

53:53.720 --> 53:54.360
Oh, my God.

53:57.320 --> 53:59.800
I was wondering which one of us would bring it up first.

53:59.800 --> 54:00.280
Yes.

54:00.280 --> 54:02.840
Did you say to delete it or make it his desktop background?

54:05.240 --> 54:07.880
Stinky, because that's his friend's name.

54:07.880 --> 54:08.680
He's a fuck up.

54:09.320 --> 54:10.600
Oh, is this Mr. Stinger-

54:10.600 --> 54:12.040
Oh, ToeJam.

54:12.040 --> 54:12.760
You fucked it.

54:12.760 --> 54:14.120
Not like that, ToeJam.

54:15.080 --> 54:16.120
You got to follow it up.

54:16.120 --> 54:18.440
Send him a text message that says, oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

54:18.440 --> 54:19.960
I didn't mean to send you that picture.

54:19.960 --> 54:22.920
I meant to send you this one and then another picture of your dick.

54:24.920 --> 54:29.240
Only that one's taken from the bottom so he can see your face,

54:29.240 --> 54:32.440
and your face is fucking stone cold serious.

54:39.000 --> 54:41.080
Send him that and say, what do I got to look forward to?

54:41.080 --> 54:43.000
Send him that and say, what do I got to look forward to?

54:43.000 --> 54:43.720
Huh?

54:43.720 --> 54:44.440
Where's it going to be?

54:45.400 --> 54:46.040
Where's it going to be?

54:47.640 --> 54:49.080
This is fucked up, this question.

54:49.960 --> 54:52.040
Why did he do this to his grandpa?

54:52.040 --> 54:55.960
Here's a good thing about this situation.

54:56.520 --> 55:01.720
I know grandparents and they've never been able to open a file before.

55:02.760 --> 55:04.920
I do not see why that's going to start now.

55:05.480 --> 55:06.520
Listen, time is short.

55:06.520 --> 55:09.720
You only have three weeks before they remember to check their phone.

55:09.720 --> 55:11.720
I'm a guy, and my best friend's a girl.

55:11.720 --> 55:14.360
She has a boyfriend, and I have a girlfriend.

55:14.360 --> 55:16.120
Hopefully something more soon.

55:16.680 --> 55:20.760
But it doesn't stop people from accusing us of hooking up every time we see each other.

55:20.760 --> 55:23.880
This includes our families and other close friends.

55:23.880 --> 55:25.880
This is really starting to get on our nerves.

55:25.880 --> 55:27.160
How do we deal with this?

55:27.160 --> 55:30.200
That's from apparently untrustworthy Melbourne.

55:30.200 --> 55:30.920
I tell you what-

55:30.920 --> 55:32.680
Justin, can I just say real quick?

55:32.680 --> 55:34.760
Your parentheticals are so good.

55:34.760 --> 55:35.480
Thanks, Trav.

55:35.480 --> 55:36.920
I really appreciate it.

55:36.920 --> 55:37.720
Listen, I'm tired.

55:37.720 --> 55:41.320
People say we are dating, I'm gonna send you a naked picture of myself.

55:41.960 --> 55:45.080
That's gonna shut these rumors up for good.

55:45.080 --> 55:47.720
Yeah, I think the only thing you can do is really just come out and confess it.

55:47.720 --> 55:48.360
You're fucking-

55:48.360 --> 55:49.160
I know you are.

55:49.720 --> 55:51.320
I know that he knows it.

55:51.320 --> 55:52.040
We all know it.

55:52.040 --> 55:55.240
I know that you're muddying up that.

55:55.240 --> 55:56.840
Guys and gals can't be friends.

55:58.040 --> 55:59.640
Neither can farmers and cow hands.

56:01.720 --> 56:02.360
Fuck you.

56:04.360 --> 56:05.320
Good night, everybody.

56:05.320 --> 56:06.200
Good night, everybody.

56:06.200 --> 56:07.240
No, who cares?

56:07.240 --> 56:10.040
Everybody, I mean, I don't understand.

56:10.600 --> 56:11.240
Do you?

56:11.240 --> 56:12.680
Oh, wait a minute.

56:12.680 --> 56:13.640
Oh, wait a minute.

56:14.280 --> 56:18.920
I think maybe this is like a Nick and New Girl situation.

56:18.920 --> 56:19.960
Oh, we're talking a little-

56:19.960 --> 56:21.720
Everybody else sees it.

56:21.720 --> 56:25.640
Oh, man, you're looking a little tense after that harmless kickball game you played.

56:25.640 --> 56:28.280
Let me rub those thighs.

56:28.280 --> 56:29.560
That might be a little forward.

56:29.560 --> 56:30.200
Maybe it's the back.

56:31.080 --> 56:31.800
Let me stick it to the back.

56:31.800 --> 56:33.400
Let me caress your legs.

56:34.200 --> 56:35.800
Let me look at your legs.

56:35.800 --> 56:36.840
Your butt looks sore.

56:36.840 --> 56:37.800
Let me check it.

56:37.800 --> 56:40.920
Let me rub your butt to prove we're not dating.

56:40.920 --> 56:42.200
I feel nothing.

56:42.200 --> 56:44.040
This is just a friend boner.

56:44.040 --> 56:47.000
This is like a big bag of pudding.

56:47.000 --> 56:50.840
Oh, I feel nothing.

56:50.840 --> 56:53.080
I am not attracted to this.

56:53.080 --> 56:56.360
This is the worst romantic novel audio book I've ever heard.

56:56.360 --> 57:03.400
He squiggled it around and it was pretty cool.

57:03.400 --> 57:07.400
He liked the way it felt on his hands.

57:07.400 --> 57:10.680
It ran over his hands like a babbling brook, the butt did.

57:12.520 --> 57:17.000
He reached into his jacket pocket and pulled out the Oakleys and placed them tenderly.

57:17.640 --> 57:18.680
Tenderly.

57:18.680 --> 57:21.160
So, so tenderly upon the hydrant's brim.

57:23.880 --> 57:26.440
We are going to do this so good, the hydrant said.

57:26.440 --> 57:31.960
She jollops down onto his lap like a bag of kids.

57:31.960 --> 57:35.960
What about your G if she asks?

57:35.960 --> 57:39.960
Don't worry about her, Mustang time.

57:39.960 --> 57:41.960
It's Mustang time, let's undulate together.

57:41.960 --> 57:45.960
Their bodies, their face slapped together kissingly.

57:45.960 --> 57:47.960
They slapped and flapped and they clapped.

57:47.960 --> 57:49.960
And it was so good, guys.

57:49.960 --> 57:53.960
It's hard for me to describe how good it was, but you have to trust me.

57:53.960 --> 57:57.960
If you had seen this, buckets.

57:57.960 --> 57:59.960
Buckets of it.

57:59.960 --> 58:03.960
Their bodies were like one of those big nets of crabs from Dudley's Catch.

58:03.960 --> 58:07.960
And one of the boats on the show as well.

58:07.960 --> 58:09.960
I don't know the names.

58:09.960 --> 58:11.960
That would have been better.

58:11.960 --> 58:13.960
Edit that in later.

58:13.960 --> 58:15.960
Wizards game or something.

58:15.960 --> 58:17.960
Time Bandit.

58:17.960 --> 58:19.960
Time Bandit, was that one of them?

58:19.960 --> 58:21.960
I think so.

58:21.960 --> 58:23.960
Is that one?

58:23.960 --> 58:25.960
Life of Brian.

58:25.960 --> 58:29.960
Brian's song was one of them.

58:29.960 --> 58:31.960
Claw game.

58:31.960 --> 58:35.960
Oh man, this episode's really just for us.

58:35.960 --> 58:39.960
Do we even need to pub this one or should we just give it to each other for Christmas on Jump Tribes?

58:39.960 --> 58:49.960
I think the problem is, anytime we record an episode during the evening, I think our synapses work different.

58:49.960 --> 58:51.960
I'm so fucking high on allergy medicine right now too.

58:51.960 --> 58:53.960
Because that's what I do at 6pm.

58:53.960 --> 58:55.960
It's jacked.

58:55.960 --> 58:57.960
So this has been our show.

58:57.960 --> 58:59.960
We didn't answer that question at all.

58:59.960 --> 59:01.960
Oh, okay.

59:01.960 --> 59:03.960
Yeah, we did.

59:03.960 --> 59:05.960
Tough it out.

59:05.960 --> 59:07.960
If you think about it, we really did.

59:07.960 --> 59:09.960
The answer is coded in there.

59:09.960 --> 59:11.960
You've got to think about it.

59:11.960 --> 59:13.960
Yeah.

59:13.960 --> 59:17.960
You have to kind of cross your eyes a little bit and look through it.

59:17.960 --> 59:19.960
You can't look at it.

59:19.960 --> 59:21.960
And then it appears like a hologram.

59:21.960 --> 59:25.960
So thank you to everybody so much for listening to the show.

59:25.960 --> 59:33.960
Thank you for those who were patient on Monday and didn't complain about a new episode.

59:33.960 --> 59:37.960
Thanks to all the neat people.

59:37.960 --> 59:41.960
I met this weekend, Seth Ryder.

59:41.960 --> 59:43.960
I met him.

59:43.960 --> 59:45.960
I can't even get into names.

59:45.960 --> 59:47.960
I met so many fucking people.

59:47.960 --> 59:49.960
It was so much fun.

59:49.960 --> 59:51.960
Yeah, it was really cool.

59:51.960 --> 59:53.960
Man, I wish we could have done some max fun.

59:53.960 --> 59:55.960
My bim bam shit up there.

59:55.960 --> 59:57.960
Did everybody miss me?

59:57.960 --> 59:59.960
Just like nobody asked about you.

59:59.960 --> 01:00:01.960
Which is weird.

01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:03.960
Nobody asked about me?

01:00:03.960 --> 01:00:05.960
That's okay.

01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:07.960
I like to remain mysterious.

01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:09.960
If you met Joey Lawrence, you would be like, oh, man.

01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:11.960
Where's Andy and Zeppo?

01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:13.960
Oh, the fuck I wouldn't.

01:00:13.960 --> 01:00:15.960
Zeppo was on Boy Meets World.

01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:19.960
And Andy played a clone movie on Disney Channel.

01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:21.960
Hey, guys.

01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:23.960
Hey, fucking guys.

01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:25.960
Hit me.

01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:27.960
The 2013 Max Fun Drive is next goddamn week.

01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:35.960
Whether you are already a devoted monthly member of Max Fun or you've never even thought about donating before, Dick, at least think about it.

01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:37.960
You know what I mean?

01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:39.960
At least cross your mind.

01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:41.960
Yeah.

01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:43.960
Either way, tune in beginning April 1st.

01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:45.960
We will be running some of our best shows of the year.

01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:51.960
We usually do some long form goose, which is good because after hearing this one, you're thinking like that but more of it.

01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:57.960
Doing awesome giveaways and tempting you with thank you gifts like our all new Intimate Sensations Pack.

01:00:57.960 --> 01:00:59.960
What's that, you ask?

01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:01.960
Oh, shit.

01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:07.960
It is, we don't know, but it's for your butt or your dick or your clam.

01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:09.960
Oh, no.

01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:13.960
By which I mean your vagina.

01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:17.960
It's from Extreme Restraints and it's a thing for your butt or your dick or your vagina.

01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:19.960
Great.

01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:21.960
So don't miss it.

01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:23.960
It starts April 1st, runs for just two weeks.

01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:29.960
Tune in, show us your support, and catch the best episodes that we've got to offer.

01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:31.960
And here's the important thing, you guys.

01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:35.960
We provide, it's so great to be part of this community and we all kind of do this together.

01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:37.960
Seriously, can't stress that enough.

01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:39.960
It's the coolest fucking community ever.

01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:41.960
I'm not talking out of my ass.

01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:45.960
It's the only community on the internet that is 100% cool people.

01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:51.960
And the important thing is that you guys all pick us as your favorite and we win Max Fun Con.

01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:53.960
We win Max Fun Drive.

01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:55.960
It's a competition.

01:01:55.960 --> 01:01:57.960
It's not so much about us winning, it's everyone else losing.

01:01:57.960 --> 01:01:59.960
Yeah, second place, first loser.

01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:03.960
Pain is weakness leaving the body and that's why we need to be first in Max Fun Drive.

01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:05.960
Third place is you're fired.

01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:11.960
And if you are not the lead dog, then sit on the porch and sniff some butts.

01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:13.960
I found the pledge gifts.

01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:15.960
Can we talk about these? Or is it a secret and tall?

01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:17.960
Let's keep it a secret.

01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:21.960
Alright, I'm looking at it though and no shit, it's the best it's ever been.

01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:23.960
Not shitting you, it's fucking amazing.

01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:25.960
Oh shit.

01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:27.960
Oh my god, the intimate sensations pack, you guys.

01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:31.960
It really does have something for everything.

01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:35.960
All the holes.

01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:37.960
All of them, it's got belly button stuff.

01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:41.960
Anyway, so that is next week.

01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:45.960
Again, the episodes are usually longer.

01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:47.960
And we'll have a bonus episode also.

01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:49.960
I don't know if we mentioned that.

01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:51.960
Is there anything else? Oh, thanks John Roderick and the Long Winters for our final theme song.

01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:53.960
Our final theme song.

01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:55.960
This is it.

01:02:55.960 --> 01:02:57.960
This is the last one.

01:02:57.960 --> 01:03:01.960
I was thinking about switching to St. Elmo's Fire in sweeps, but no.

01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:03.960
This one's final.

01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:05.960
It's our theme song.

01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:07.960
It's a departure off the album, putting the days to bed.

01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:09.960
It's a gooden, it's an oldie.

01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:11.960
Is it an oldie yet?

01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:13.960
If I turn it on 101.5, the RIV, am I gonna hear it?

01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:15.960
Definitely.

01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:17.960
I'm not, because it's now Bob FM.

01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:19.960
Definitely not gonna hear it on Bob FM.

01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:23.960
And finally, some jokes everyone can enjoy.

01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:25.960
Bob FM's worldwide, we got Bob FM here.

01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:27.960
It's a radio station that thinks he's a person.

01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:29.960
Which is the fucking saddest thing I've ever heard.

01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:33.960
It's a radio station that knows how to love.

01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:35.960
His jams are real, but he is not.

01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:39.960
Thank you for listening or whatever.

01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:41.960
And this has been my brother, my brother, me.

01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:43.960
Here's your final question.

01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:45.960
You really want this to be over, don't you?

01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:47.960
Justin just fell asleep.

01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:49.960
Both my cats are in my office now.

01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:51.960
Oh, it's cuddle time.

01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:53.960
I'll hurry it up so you can get the sandwich in your face.

01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:55.960
Snug o'clock.

01:03:55.960 --> 01:03:57.960
Time to snug out.

01:03:57.960 --> 01:03:59.960
Nick Jensen sent this one in.

01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:01.960
Thanks, Nick Jensen.

01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:03.960
It's by Yahoo! Answers user Michaela, who asks,

01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:09.960
What is Taylor Swift's favorite foods at Cracker Barrel?

01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:11.960
I'm Justin McElroy.

01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:13.960
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:15.960
This has been my brother, my brother, me.

01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:17.960
Kiss your dad.
