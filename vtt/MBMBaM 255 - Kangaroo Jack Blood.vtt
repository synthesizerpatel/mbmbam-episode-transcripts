00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:46.720 --> 00:49.200
Hey everybody, it's- it's my brother, my brother and me,

00:49.200 --> 00:53.440
advice show from the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

00:53.440 --> 00:54.720
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

00:54.720 --> 00:58.080
I found these grubs in these berries, guys. Eat these grubs and berries, we need some protein.

00:58.080 --> 00:58.880
Awesome, great.

00:58.880 --> 00:59.920
I'm Griffin McElroy.

01:02.240 --> 01:06.400
Sorry, I'm looped out from those berries we ate on the trail.

01:06.400 --> 01:07.360
That was a mistake.

01:08.000 --> 01:13.600
We are currently on the run, our faces ashen like Dekisian children.

01:13.600 --> 01:18.560
We're on the run for the Powerade factory slash gulag slash fitness center

01:18.560 --> 01:21.200
that we escaped from after last week's debacle.

01:21.920 --> 01:24.560
We're trying to make it- we're trying to make it to upper Montana.

01:24.560 --> 01:25.680
We hear there's freedom there.

01:26.320 --> 01:29.520
Raul is- Raul is dead. I bit him to death.

01:29.520 --> 01:31.600
I bit him and I just kept biting and biting and biting,

01:31.600 --> 01:33.760
and Justin was like, go Griffin, go, go, go, bite.

01:33.760 --> 01:36.320
Or go, go Chaz, bite, bite, bite, bite, bite.

01:36.320 --> 01:40.240
And I said, rule out it, in my dog voice.

01:40.240 --> 01:42.480
And then I bit him and he died from all the bites.

01:42.480 --> 01:44.960
Griffin's- Sorry?

01:44.960 --> 01:47.760
A lot of people have noticed that Griffin slash Chaz-

01:47.760 --> 01:49.840
Well, no, I'm gonna explain what happened.

01:50.480 --> 01:53.680
A lot of people have noticed we've been referring to Chaz slash Griffin

01:53.680 --> 01:55.600
intermittently as both Chaz and Griffin.

01:55.600 --> 01:57.040
Here's the really scary thing.

01:57.040 --> 02:01.840
Griffin's human to dog surgery is starting to wear off.

02:01.840 --> 02:02.960
It's starting to fail.

02:02.960 --> 02:05.120
It was a spell? Was it a spell?

02:05.120 --> 02:05.840
I got a spell.

02:05.840 --> 02:07.600
Some kind of medical spell.

02:07.600 --> 02:10.480
I've got a- I got three paws, I got a foot,

02:10.480 --> 02:14.560
and half of my face is human, but not the half you'd expect.

02:14.560 --> 02:15.520
The inside half.

02:15.520 --> 02:16.400
The inside half.

02:16.400 --> 02:17.600
Oh God, oh God, oh God.

02:17.600 --> 02:18.720
Oh God, oh God.

02:18.720 --> 02:19.760
My man guts.

02:19.760 --> 02:22.560
It's a slimy, furry prison, and I hate it.

02:22.560 --> 02:23.920
Please, please set me free.

02:24.800 --> 02:26.800
So I just do want to say real quick,

02:28.160 --> 02:32.160
we are sponsored by Powerade, the thirst, the feeder.

02:32.960 --> 02:34.640
They've got a lot of different flavors.

02:34.640 --> 02:36.480
We're contractually obligated still.

02:37.280 --> 02:38.480
Why did we sign it?

02:38.480 --> 02:40.400
Why did we agree to do this?

02:40.400 --> 02:42.000
Why did we sign it in blood?

02:42.000 --> 02:42.960
I'll tell you the worst-

02:42.960 --> 02:45.600
It was weird that there was so much chanting and stuff, right?

02:45.600 --> 02:46.560
Like that's not me.

02:46.560 --> 02:49.600
Like now, like looking back on it in the moment,

02:49.600 --> 02:52.080
it didn't seem weird, but now that I look back on it,

02:52.080 --> 02:52.560
it seems weird.

02:52.560 --> 02:55.440
Yeah, like any sort of, from this point forward,

02:55.440 --> 02:56.960
we gotta be more savvy about this stuff.

02:56.960 --> 02:59.600
Any sort of professional advertising arrangement

02:59.600 --> 03:02.320
that involves the opening of a cosmic portal,

03:03.120 --> 03:05.360
we just don't, maybe we pass on that one.

03:05.360 --> 03:07.840
I know the money's good, but we just pass on that one.

03:07.840 --> 03:09.440
I'll tell you the real shame about all this is,

03:09.440 --> 03:12.400
I genuinely enjoy the Powerade product.

03:12.400 --> 03:13.360
I do too.

03:13.360 --> 03:16.560
It defeats my thirst in a really, really satisfying,

03:16.560 --> 03:20.000
in a way that I would say no other fluid is capable of doing.

03:20.000 --> 03:20.880
And now like, I don't know,

03:20.880 --> 03:22.880
the whole thing's been solid for me a little bit.

03:23.840 --> 03:26.080
It's the worst part, it's genuinely refreshing.

03:26.080 --> 03:29.680
It's genuinely, it blasts my flavor receptors.

03:31.040 --> 03:34.160
It overwhelms me with its power, aid.

03:34.160 --> 03:37.360
But anyway, this is still an advice show

03:37.360 --> 03:38.240
for the modern era,

03:39.520 --> 03:41.600
and I'm still your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

03:42.320 --> 03:44.080
I'm still your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy,

03:44.080 --> 03:44.960
like I said earlier.

03:44.960 --> 03:46.720
I'm still just figuring myself out.

03:46.720 --> 03:50.960
I'm the protagonist in a weird, weird

03:50.960 --> 03:53.280
Judy Blume slash H.P. Lovecraft book.

03:54.160 --> 03:54.960
H.P. Blume.

03:55.840 --> 03:56.720
Judy Lovecraft?

03:56.720 --> 03:57.360
Judy Lovecraft.

03:57.360 --> 03:58.000
Judy Lovecraft.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.680
Yeah, it was right there, damn it.

04:00.880 --> 04:02.000
Anyway, it's an advice show, here we go.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.680
Dear sweet, sweet brothers,

04:03.680 --> 04:04.720
I need your assistance.

04:04.720 --> 04:06.640
I started working in a small office setting

04:06.640 --> 04:08.080
about nine months ago.

04:08.080 --> 04:09.920
I have roughly five coworkers.

04:09.920 --> 04:11.840
I've never had any run-ins with any of them

04:11.840 --> 04:12.560
until recently.

04:12.560 --> 04:15.120
One gentleman that has an office two cubicles down from me

04:15.120 --> 04:18.080
has started snooping around my area

04:18.080 --> 04:21.120
while I'm working to what I imagine

04:21.120 --> 04:24.720
is make sure I'm working on some bologna like that.

04:24.720 --> 04:26.320
No, you read that so bad.

04:26.320 --> 04:27.360
Let me try again.

04:27.360 --> 04:28.720
You're working on that bologna, right?

04:28.720 --> 04:31.920
Hey, where you at on that bologna, Steve?

04:31.920 --> 04:33.520
You're still working on it.

04:33.520 --> 04:35.360
You're my top man for bologna projects.

04:36.880 --> 04:40.400
No, working or some, but it is, okay.

04:40.960 --> 04:43.520
It is literally, it's already hard enough

04:45.200 --> 04:47.040
for me to read out loud.

04:47.040 --> 04:49.600
Do I really have to try to translate in my head

04:49.600 --> 04:53.840
the letters in bologna to bologna like on the fly?

04:53.840 --> 04:56.480
Like I'm supposed to be able to do that processing instantly?

04:57.280 --> 04:57.920
Yeah, what is this?

04:57.920 --> 04:59.440
The talented and gifted program?

04:59.440 --> 05:00.160
Come on, people.

05:00.880 --> 05:03.520
I work hard, but take a minute or two every now and then

05:03.520 --> 05:05.040
to turn on a new podcast.

05:05.040 --> 05:06.160
Oh, thank you.

05:06.160 --> 05:08.960
Or take a second to stretch out just like anybody else.

05:09.760 --> 05:11.120
So how can I look like I'm working

05:11.120 --> 05:12.640
without this guy coming at moments

05:12.640 --> 05:14.560
where it looks like I'm not?

05:14.560 --> 05:17.520
And that's from Annoyed in Atlanta.

05:18.560 --> 05:19.840
Is this guy your boss?

05:19.840 --> 05:21.520
Because you don't say that he's your boss.

05:21.520 --> 05:24.400
And if he's not your boss, what's up?

05:24.400 --> 05:25.760
What's up with that, I say.

05:25.760 --> 05:28.800
Okay, then you just make eye contact with him and nod.

05:28.800 --> 05:31.600
Like, yeah, I am, do something.

05:32.400 --> 05:34.400
If you're on a good website,

05:34.400 --> 05:36.000
then they'll have a boss button

05:36.000 --> 05:38.720
with like a zany picture of a boss next to it.

05:38.720 --> 05:38.960
Yeah.

05:38.960 --> 05:41.440
You'll click and it'll look like spreadsheets or something.

05:41.440 --> 05:42.960
And what does a boss look like, Justin?

05:42.960 --> 05:45.520
Give me an idea of what a boss in your mind.

05:45.520 --> 05:47.840
He's got fat head, he's got that weird.

05:47.840 --> 05:49.360
Oh, so it's a man you're just gonna go ahead

05:49.360 --> 05:50.800
and assume it is a man.

05:50.800 --> 05:54.800
I'm saying the boss, the stylized boss from the boss button.

05:54.800 --> 05:58.080
The misogynistic web joke on the web portals.

05:59.600 --> 06:00.800
He's got a cigar.

06:00.800 --> 06:04.640
You know, the Dilbert mini game collection.

06:05.680 --> 06:07.840
You guys remember the Dilbert mini game collection?

06:07.840 --> 06:09.520
Oh, absolutely.

06:09.520 --> 06:12.000
Yeah, I think I just got put in the video game hall of fame.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.840
It's in the video game hall of fame.

06:13.840 --> 06:15.360
They're speed running it

06:15.360 --> 06:17.440
during this year's Summer Games Sun Quick Event.

06:17.440 --> 06:18.560
I'm really excited about it.

06:18.560 --> 06:21.600
It was a game that I think you got out of a Chex Mix bag.

06:21.600 --> 06:25.680
Yeah, Dilbert's desktop game was a family favorite.

06:27.120 --> 06:32.160
Because we all, as pre-teens, we knew how hard it was

06:32.160 --> 06:36.640
to be a wage slave in middle management,

06:36.640 --> 06:38.000
office drone kind of thing.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.760
So we really appreciated those gags.

06:41.280 --> 06:45.760
But the Dilbert desktop games had a boss button on it.

06:45.760 --> 06:48.720
But it would turn your desktop into spreadsheets,

06:48.720 --> 06:49.760
which was good.

06:49.760 --> 06:52.640
But there were still some Dilbert touches.

06:54.160 --> 06:57.360
I don't know how you would explain to your boss,

06:58.960 --> 07:01.840
well, yeah, it's a Dilbert-centric spreadsheet, you see.

07:01.840 --> 07:03.920
I got a theory I'm working on,

07:03.920 --> 07:06.560
that the way we improve business is Dilbert.

07:07.200 --> 07:12.960
I got some Dilbert futures that I'm looking into for investment.

07:12.960 --> 07:15.840
Listen, boss, we need to invest heavily in Dilbert.

07:15.840 --> 07:18.160
Please understand, these are Dilbert stickers

07:18.160 --> 07:20.000
that are stuck permanently to my monitor.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.520
I can't get these things off.

07:21.520 --> 07:22.960
They're all over my work.

07:23.520 --> 07:25.040
They were here when I got here.

07:25.040 --> 07:27.920
Here's a quick clip from the GameSpot review

07:27.920 --> 07:30.160
of Dilbert's desktop games.

07:30.160 --> 07:32.640
This reviewer finds CEO Simulator

07:32.640 --> 07:36.320
the most disappointing of the functional actual mini-games.

07:36.320 --> 07:39.120
What was promised to play out like a business simulator

07:39.120 --> 07:40.960
is really nothing more than an effort

07:40.960 --> 07:43.840
that can best be described as watering a plant

07:43.840 --> 07:47.120
to see it bloom a huge but unimpressive flower.

07:47.120 --> 07:50.640
Burn it down. Burn that game down.

07:50.640 --> 07:54.320
I'm canceling my reservation at the electronics boutique.

07:56.400 --> 07:57.520
I'm going to Babbage's,

07:57.520 --> 08:00.160
and I'm going to have a firm conversation

08:00.160 --> 08:01.200
with the manager there.

08:03.840 --> 08:05.680
It's hard for me to advise in this situation

08:05.680 --> 08:08.160
because I'm just so incensed at this narc,

08:08.160 --> 08:09.840
at this work cop.

08:10.400 --> 08:12.800
Here's the thing, Griffin, all you need,

08:12.800 --> 08:16.080
because this is the worst way this could play out, right?

08:16.080 --> 08:19.360
Like the best case scenario for this snoop person

08:19.360 --> 08:22.560
is they see you doing some non-work related activity.

08:22.560 --> 08:25.760
They go tattle, like a little tattle baby,

08:25.760 --> 08:28.400
and then the boss comes and you're back to working

08:28.400 --> 08:30.720
and you're like, I don't know what he's talking about.

08:31.600 --> 08:32.800
Maybe I checked my phone

08:32.800 --> 08:35.120
because I'm waiting for a call from my father,

08:35.120 --> 08:36.400
but is that it?

08:36.400 --> 08:38.240
Is that what you're talking about, Steve?

08:38.240 --> 08:39.840
And then Steve looks like an asshole.

08:39.840 --> 08:45.840
Unless Steve is like snapping paparazzo pictures of you,

08:45.840 --> 08:48.400
like Googling your own name,

08:48.400 --> 08:50.240
I think you're probably going to be fine.

08:51.920 --> 08:53.600
As long as he's not like your boss.

08:53.600 --> 08:55.200
If he's like your supervisor

08:55.200 --> 08:57.040
and he's trying to get like a gotcha moment,

08:57.040 --> 08:58.480
you need to find a new job.

08:58.480 --> 09:00.000
It's kind of like you're living in Utopia,

09:00.000 --> 09:01.600
the television show that was short lived

09:01.600 --> 09:03.520
but beloved on its time on this earth.

09:04.720 --> 09:07.440
By two thirds of the world's population

09:07.440 --> 09:09.840
as represented by this podcast.

09:09.840 --> 09:11.360
Why would they cancel the show

09:11.360 --> 09:13.200
if two thirds of the world was watching it?

09:13.200 --> 09:14.240
The guy was so deep.

09:14.240 --> 09:15.120
Do you guys want to know who?

09:15.920 --> 09:16.640
Yeah, please.

09:16.640 --> 09:18.240
Oh wait, one other thing.

09:18.240 --> 09:19.680
This reviewer and the friend

09:19.680 --> 09:22.080
that introduced this game to this reviewer

09:22.080 --> 09:23.840
have, it's written like this.

09:23.840 --> 09:25.280
This reviewer and the friend

09:25.280 --> 09:27.120
that introduced this game to this reviewer

09:27.120 --> 09:30.080
have always been fans of Scott Adams' brainchild.

09:30.080 --> 09:32.560
Therefore, it was much to this reviewer's delight

09:32.560 --> 09:34.240
when given the chance to play the game

09:34.240 --> 09:38.160
that he more or less sanctioned.

09:38.160 --> 09:38.640
Oh boy.

09:38.640 --> 09:39.840
Yahoo would be excellent.

09:39.840 --> 09:40.560
Okay, here it comes.

09:40.560 --> 09:41.920
This one was sent in by level 9,000.

09:41.920 --> 09:44.240
Yahoo answers user Drew Davenport.

09:44.800 --> 09:46.960
I forget all of his honorifics.

09:46.960 --> 09:47.520
Thank you, Drew.

09:47.520 --> 09:50.800
It's by an anonymous Yahoo user who asks,

09:52.640 --> 09:57.120
I want to become a freelance spy and have an agency.

09:57.120 --> 09:59.280
How do I get missions?

09:59.840 --> 10:01.600
Brother, if you can figure that out,

10:02.240 --> 10:03.600
you let me know.

10:03.600 --> 10:06.400
You're talking right to 14-year-old Travis.

10:06.960 --> 10:08.880
Slash 30-year-old Travis.

10:08.880 --> 10:10.400
Slash the 14-year-old Travis

10:10.400 --> 10:12.320
that lives in 31-year-old Travis

10:12.320 --> 10:14.480
and wears him like an exoskeleton.

10:14.480 --> 10:17.840
Man, there's a lot of exoskeleton talk in this area.

10:17.840 --> 10:19.920
Is this something that we're all really struggling with?

10:19.920 --> 10:22.160
Because if so, we need to form some sort of support group.

10:22.800 --> 10:25.280
How do you get missions for your freelance spy agency?

10:25.280 --> 10:27.520
Let's go ahead and assume this person is 14.

10:28.240 --> 10:28.800
Okay.

10:28.800 --> 10:29.440
Yeah, right.

10:30.160 --> 10:31.200
So mean spy.

10:31.200 --> 10:35.680
So I guess it depends on what kind of spy you want to be.

10:36.720 --> 10:38.880
Because there's like two or three different kinds.

10:38.880 --> 10:40.320
You've got like your James Bond,

10:40.320 --> 10:43.840
who's like your smooth kind of cool person.

10:43.840 --> 10:47.920
Okay, I was thinking more like Halloween candy was stolen

10:47.920 --> 10:52.080
from Jennifer and now we're going to track it down.

10:52.080 --> 10:53.520
Although that's more the attack.

10:53.520 --> 10:54.400
It's me.

10:54.400 --> 10:56.160
Smooth, cool person, Bond.

10:56.880 --> 10:57.760
James Bond.

10:57.760 --> 10:59.920
What is that?

10:59.920 --> 11:02.560
I'm trying to break down the classifications.

11:02.560 --> 11:04.800
I haven't come up with labels or anything yet.

11:04.800 --> 11:07.520
You've also got kind of like your robber spies, right?

11:07.520 --> 11:10.800
Like your cat burglar spies.

11:10.800 --> 11:12.080
But those are just cat burglars.

11:12.800 --> 11:16.160
A spy is a very specific gig.

11:16.160 --> 11:16.800
And it's not a-

11:16.800 --> 11:18.800
I would say like a, what's his name?

11:19.600 --> 11:23.040
The Tom Cruise from those ghost protocol movies.

11:23.040 --> 11:23.200
Yeah.

11:23.200 --> 11:25.280
The Mission Impossible movies.

11:25.280 --> 11:26.240
Yeah, he's a spy.

11:26.240 --> 11:29.120
There's Sutterfuge and Subtlety

11:29.120 --> 11:31.520
and all kinds of sub-based words.

11:31.520 --> 11:34.560
But I would say that he does a lot of cat burgling-esque stuff.

11:34.560 --> 11:35.840
He lowers it on wires.

11:35.840 --> 11:38.960
He kind of like wears masks, spoiler alert.

11:38.960 --> 11:42.080
Are the Fast and the Furious crew spies?

11:42.080 --> 11:44.400
I would say that they're spies by the later movies.

11:44.400 --> 11:47.200
When you get into like the six, sevens, and eights,

11:48.320 --> 11:49.200
they're contracted by the company.

11:49.200 --> 11:51.120
The forbidden Fast and Furious, Fast 8.

11:51.120 --> 11:52.240
Yeah, the non-canonical.

11:52.240 --> 11:54.960
The Christmas special.

11:56.560 --> 11:59.200
Hey, we gotta steal Santa's sleigh.

11:59.200 --> 12:00.960
It's armed with nuclear devices.

12:00.960 --> 12:02.880
We gotta steal Santa's sleigh.

12:02.880 --> 12:03.600
You got it.

12:03.600 --> 12:05.440
Saddle up, one last ride.

12:06.400 --> 12:10.400
The Fast crew will return in Fast 9.

12:10.400 --> 12:12.880
You literally just said it was your last ride.

12:12.880 --> 12:15.120
I'm currently watching Fast 5.

12:15.120 --> 12:16.400
Quick diversion for Fast 5.

12:16.400 --> 12:17.520
Like right this second?

12:17.520 --> 12:18.320
Objections?

12:18.320 --> 12:19.520
Yeah, it's better than this.

12:20.480 --> 12:21.280
I'm currently watching-

12:21.280 --> 12:23.760
No, I'm currently, what I mean by that is

12:23.760 --> 12:26.880
I have a baby, so I watch it in 15 minute increments.

12:27.600 --> 12:31.360
I'm like literally, I'm reading Fast 5 chapter by chapter

12:31.360 --> 12:32.800
is basically what I'm doing.

12:32.800 --> 12:35.840
I've been watching Fast 5 for two weeks.

12:35.840 --> 12:37.440
So I've had a lot of time to think about it.

12:38.560 --> 12:41.840
The flip that the special agent The Rock makes

12:42.480 --> 12:44.960
is basically just the most insane thing

12:44.960 --> 12:46.400
I've ever seen on a television show.

12:46.400 --> 12:48.480
I think he enters into a fugue state,

12:48.480 --> 12:49.840
if I remember correctly.

12:49.840 --> 12:53.600
Like does he get hit on the head and forget what morals are

12:53.600 --> 12:55.360
is what I remember happens in the movie.

12:55.360 --> 12:58.880
No, he just decides that instead of capturing the criminals

12:58.880 --> 13:00.880
that he was sent to capture,

13:00.880 --> 13:04.560
he's gonna kill a drug dealer on foreign soil.

13:04.560 --> 13:06.960
Like that's what he's gonna try that instead.

13:07.520 --> 13:09.440
Like not even capture this dude.

13:09.440 --> 13:12.000
He's just gonna go kill this drug dealer instead

13:12.000 --> 13:13.280
with the criminals.

13:13.280 --> 13:16.960
I've seen up through Fast 6 and they all bleed together

13:16.960 --> 13:20.960
so much I can't remember movie to movie

13:21.520 --> 13:23.040
what happens in which movie.

13:23.040 --> 13:26.320
I just remember it as one kind of like Katamari Damacy.

13:26.320 --> 13:28.880
It's all just rolled up into one big ball

13:28.880 --> 13:30.720
of Fast and the Furious in my head

13:30.720 --> 13:34.080
and I cannot separate out individual storylines.

13:34.640 --> 13:38.240
Right, well that's the, it's all occurring simultaneously.

13:38.240 --> 13:41.360
Yeah, they drove so fast that they broke the time barrier.

13:41.920 --> 13:44.080
Time no longer works in the Fast 5 universe.

13:44.080 --> 13:45.360
That makes so much sense.

13:45.360 --> 13:47.680
How is this person gonna get missions?

13:47.680 --> 13:48.720
The Furiverse.

13:48.720 --> 13:50.480
The Fast and Furiverse.

13:51.280 --> 13:53.360
How's this person gonna get freelance spy missions?

13:54.240 --> 13:56.400
I feel like there's probably a website.

13:56.960 --> 13:57.600
Craigslist?

13:58.240 --> 14:00.320
Something like Daniel Craigslist.

14:02.560 --> 14:03.200
That's good.

14:03.200 --> 14:04.880
Thanks, excellent Travis.

14:04.880 --> 14:07.440
If I were to, I mean I've written some spy fiction,

14:08.720 --> 14:12.240
a series of novels titled Grant Andrews Kid Cop

14:12.240 --> 14:15.440
that I think might be able to shine some light in this.

14:15.440 --> 14:16.160
And in my-

14:16.160 --> 14:18.320
Published by Rock Books, isn't it Griffin?

14:18.320 --> 14:22.960
In the seminal chapter, the beginning,

14:22.960 --> 14:25.920
the bestseller, Grant Andrews Kid Cop, no subtitle,

14:27.280 --> 14:30.240
he just starts doing the cop's job for them.

14:31.600 --> 14:34.720
Right, like they find a bomb in a bank

14:34.720 --> 14:37.280
and he just takes it and he takes it to the park

14:37.280 --> 14:39.200
and he throws it in a pond

14:39.200 --> 14:41.360
and then when it detonates, nothing happens

14:41.360 --> 14:43.040
and then he gets to be a cop for that.

14:44.960 --> 14:48.640
So it may be, if you wanna be a kid spy,

14:48.640 --> 14:52.400
you just start spying and then the cash flow will come later.

14:52.400 --> 14:53.760
Don't worry about the cash flow now.

14:53.760 --> 14:56.320
Well Griffin, do you think that with that advice,

14:56.320 --> 14:58.480
do you think you start spying like on neighbors?

14:58.480 --> 15:01.280
Like you start small and you kind of build up

15:01.280 --> 15:05.280
to kind of spying on international heads of state?

15:05.280 --> 15:05.760
No, no, no, no, no, no.

15:05.760 --> 15:07.440
If you're gonna go to town, you go into Lincoln

15:07.440 --> 15:11.120
and you drive that Lincoln to Abu Dhabi or something

15:11.120 --> 15:12.800
and then you just start spying on, you know.

15:12.800 --> 15:15.120
So the first thing you need to do is get to Abu Dhabi.

15:15.120 --> 15:16.320
Yeah, easy.

15:16.320 --> 15:18.560
And then just start spying on diplomats.

15:18.560 --> 15:20.960
Yeah, just start paying, you keep saying spying

15:20.960 --> 15:22.480
and spying is, I feel like you're saying it

15:22.480 --> 15:23.200
like it's a bad word.

15:23.200 --> 15:25.360
Just pay attention to what other people are doing.

15:25.360 --> 15:26.640
Observe, observe.

15:26.640 --> 15:28.160
Pay attention to what other people are doing

15:28.160 --> 15:30.160
in their private times when they don't want you here.

15:30.160 --> 15:31.840
Wait a minute, what if the dude

15:32.400 --> 15:34.720
in the first question asker's office

15:35.280 --> 15:38.720
was in like very, very basic rudimentary spy training?

15:38.720 --> 15:39.280
Oh my God.

15:39.280 --> 15:42.160
He was in like, he was in remedial recon.

15:42.160 --> 15:42.480
Yeah.

15:42.480 --> 15:43.360
Yeah, exactly.

15:44.160 --> 15:47.200
Grant Andrews job cop is actually,

15:47.200 --> 15:48.080
oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.

15:48.080 --> 15:49.040
I wrote that one already.

15:49.040 --> 15:51.440
That was the fourth book in the series.

15:51.440 --> 15:54.640
Information Gathering Basics, otherwise known as 411101.

15:55.760 --> 15:57.840
I'm at work and I just ordered two medium pizzas.

15:58.560 --> 15:59.280
Brag.

15:59.280 --> 16:00.640
I would love that right now.

16:00.640 --> 16:02.080
Cause I want a pizza.

16:02.080 --> 16:03.760
It's 11, it's 11 in the morning.

16:04.960 --> 16:06.240
No, it's 1121.

16:06.240 --> 16:07.680
We're cruising up on pizza time.

16:07.680 --> 16:08.000
Okay.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.640
Raise your hand if you've been up since 530.

16:10.640 --> 16:12.000
It's pizza time.

16:12.000 --> 16:12.960
I want a pizza.

16:13.520 --> 16:15.840
There was a deal on Pizza Hut's website.

16:15.840 --> 16:16.800
When it gets here,

16:16.800 --> 16:20.480
I fear the 13 people in the office with me will want some

16:20.480 --> 16:22.480
or at the very least harshly judge me

16:22.480 --> 16:23.760
for having ordered two pizzas for myself.

16:23.760 --> 16:25.520
How could you fuck this up this bad?

16:26.240 --> 16:27.200
I'm happy to share,

16:27.200 --> 16:29.120
but I don't want to send out an email to everyone

16:29.120 --> 16:32.160
letting them all know that some of them could get a pizza.

16:32.160 --> 16:34.560
They're quick.

16:34.560 --> 16:38.720
And I've already eaten my fill.

16:38.720 --> 16:40.320
You just toss in the scraps

16:40.320 --> 16:42.240
and let them fight over it for your music.

16:42.240 --> 16:45.760
No, I believe I have room for one final pepperoni.

16:47.280 --> 16:50.880
Slide it between my slippery grease stained lips.

16:51.440 --> 16:54.800
Deborah, kill Steven for this slice of cheese pizza.

16:55.600 --> 16:57.040
Have I made a horrible mistake?

16:57.040 --> 16:57.440
Yes.

16:58.400 --> 17:00.080
What would you do if you were in my position?

17:00.080 --> 17:00.400
Quit.

17:00.400 --> 17:01.200
That's from Andy.

17:01.200 --> 17:03.440
I wouldn't be in your position, Andrew.

17:03.440 --> 17:05.840
That's, that's, that's like basic.

17:05.840 --> 17:09.680
That's basics like classroom, bring enough gum, homie.

17:10.400 --> 17:13.280
Your only chance now is to throw some sort of

17:13.280 --> 17:15.600
survivor reward challenge there away

17:15.600 --> 17:18.720
and call it some sort of like company wide bonding activity.

17:18.720 --> 17:23.040
You could also, when the pizza delivery person shows up,

17:23.040 --> 17:25.760
accuse them of being a liar and send them away.

17:26.960 --> 17:28.480
That I didn't order.

17:28.480 --> 17:30.320
Is this some kind of prank?

17:30.320 --> 17:32.720
Who would order just two medium pizzas

17:32.720 --> 17:34.960
for an office of 14 people?

17:34.960 --> 17:36.480
Get this garbage out of here.

17:37.200 --> 17:38.960
I like the idea that,

17:39.760 --> 17:42.160
I like the idea that this person asked this question

17:42.160 --> 17:44.400
and just cannot act until they've heard back.

17:45.440 --> 17:48.480
The pizza's just molding on their desk.

17:48.480 --> 17:49.840
No, don't you touch it.

17:49.840 --> 17:51.200
Can you say it's your birthday

17:51.200 --> 17:54.560
or perhaps some other very personal holiday

17:54.560 --> 17:57.360
that's only for Andy, just an Andy specific.

17:57.360 --> 18:00.880
Maybe, maybe I just got a vasectomy

18:00.880 --> 18:03.280
and so I'm having myself a little pizza party for myself

18:03.280 --> 18:05.360
and you can have my leftover vasectomy pizza

18:05.360 --> 18:06.880
if you want, I guess.

18:06.880 --> 18:11.360
It's a very, this is about as personal as a pan pizza gets.

18:11.360 --> 18:13.520
I thought I deserved a slice for a slice.

18:14.800 --> 18:18.080
Could you stack the pizzas, the two pizzas on top?

18:18.080 --> 18:18.720
Oh, here we go.

18:18.720 --> 18:21.040
To make it look like you just ordered yourself

18:21.040 --> 18:22.640
a double decker pizza.

18:22.640 --> 18:24.880
It's new from Pizza Hut.

18:24.880 --> 18:27.200
Oh no, this is just a pizza sandwich.

18:27.200 --> 18:28.080
You don't understand.

18:28.080 --> 18:31.040
This, flip it upside down, you got calzone.

18:31.040 --> 18:32.240
There you go, now you're working with fire.

18:32.240 --> 18:34.720
Oh no, I just ordered an overfilled calzone.

18:34.720 --> 18:37.600
I see, so take, dismantle one pizza

18:37.600 --> 18:39.440
into its constituent slices.

18:39.440 --> 18:41.760
Put all of those on top of the other pizza

18:41.760 --> 18:45.600
in a footloose and fancy free manner.

18:45.600 --> 18:47.120
Then you fold that pizza inside.

18:47.120 --> 18:49.120
Now it's secretly, shh, shh, shh,

18:49.120 --> 18:51.920
tell no one there's another pizza up in here.

18:51.920 --> 18:54.400
And then you close that over and all of a sudden

18:54.400 --> 18:56.560
it's just a big calzone for one big boy

18:56.560 --> 18:58.560
and that's you Andy, happy vasectomy day.

18:59.280 --> 19:00.720
I cracked it.

19:00.720 --> 19:02.560
You get a plate, okay?

19:02.560 --> 19:05.600
You scrape all the cheese and sauce and toppings

19:05.600 --> 19:07.440
onto the plate off of both pizzas

19:07.440 --> 19:09.360
and you tell people you're on Atkins

19:09.360 --> 19:11.440
and this is the only way you can get full

19:11.440 --> 19:13.600
is to eat the top of the pizza

19:13.600 --> 19:14.640
because it doesn't have carbs.

19:14.640 --> 19:17.680
And then later, the next day,

19:17.680 --> 19:19.280
you come into the office and you say,

19:19.280 --> 19:20.640
you're trying a new thing.

19:20.640 --> 19:23.120
It's called reverse Atkins and you eat the crusts.

19:23.120 --> 19:28.400
Wait, so rather than enjoy your pizza,

19:28.400 --> 19:31.760
you're now forcing yourself to eat a big, awesome cheese.

19:31.760 --> 19:33.840
You're still enjoying your pizza,

19:33.840 --> 19:35.680
you're just getting it in installments.

19:35.680 --> 19:37.040
It's an installment plan.

19:37.760 --> 19:40.000
Like the way I'm watching Fast Five.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.960
Hey Mark, I need to use the company centrifuge real quick.

19:42.960 --> 19:44.800
I need to divide these two pizzas up

19:44.800 --> 19:47.120
into their molecular components.

19:47.120 --> 19:49.760
Hey, we still got that large Hadron collider downstairs, right?

19:49.760 --> 19:50.080
Right.

19:50.080 --> 19:52.000
Okay, I need to borrow it for a minute.

19:52.000 --> 19:53.600
I'm gonna smash these two pizzas together

19:53.600 --> 19:54.800
and just eat the carbon.

19:56.480 --> 19:58.800
I'm gonna reduce these down to a carbon tablet.

20:00.320 --> 20:03.200
Oh, created a pizza black hole in the basement.

20:03.200 --> 20:05.440
It's the most radical singularity.

20:06.400 --> 20:08.880
Probably the best thing you could do with the second pizza

20:08.880 --> 20:12.800
is to take seven of the slices.

20:13.600 --> 20:16.560
Assuming you're leaving one extra for yourself

20:16.560 --> 20:18.080
because after I finish a pizza,

20:18.080 --> 20:19.920
I always think I could use one more slice of pizza

20:19.920 --> 20:20.560
and now you have that.

20:20.560 --> 20:22.640
So you have seven slices to divide up.

20:22.640 --> 20:27.440
Take, put one slice on each of seven desks,

20:28.160 --> 20:29.440
make no mention of it

20:29.440 --> 20:34.960
and watch that office rip itself a fucking part.

20:34.960 --> 20:36.400
Where did you, was there pizza?

20:36.400 --> 20:37.440
Where did you get pizza?

20:37.440 --> 20:38.320
Where's this pizza from?

20:38.320 --> 20:39.680
Who got, where did you get pizza?

20:39.680 --> 20:40.800
I want some pizza.

20:40.800 --> 20:42.720
Fuck, it'll be Lord of the Flies in there

20:42.720 --> 20:45.760
by the time Tammy comes back from her lunch break.

20:45.760 --> 20:46.800
It'll be a nightmare.

20:46.800 --> 20:48.400
I haven't worked in an office in my life.

20:48.400 --> 20:50.560
It's, but it's like this though, right?

20:50.560 --> 20:52.720
Like if one person has one tastation,

20:53.280 --> 20:55.680
it's the end days.

20:55.680 --> 20:59.040
I also, so the office I worked at was with the theater.

20:59.040 --> 21:01.120
So there were also lots of like actors

21:01.120 --> 21:02.640
and like young company members and everything.

21:02.640 --> 21:04.080
So if somebody ordered a pizza,

21:04.640 --> 21:07.520
you could watch them like hyenas

21:07.520 --> 21:09.600
waiting for the person eating the pizza

21:09.600 --> 21:11.280
to be done with the pizza

21:11.280 --> 21:14.160
to see if there were any pizza remains.

21:14.160 --> 21:14.560
So there was a lot of like-

21:14.560 --> 21:16.240
Pizza smells in the air.

21:16.240 --> 21:19.920
Are you done with, I see that there's some like pepperoni

21:19.920 --> 21:21.760
stuck to the bottom of the box.

21:21.760 --> 21:22.880
Can I eat those now?

21:22.880 --> 21:25.120
Can I put my nose in your greasy mouth?

21:25.120 --> 21:29.280
Every office has a weird DMZ, Griffin,

21:29.280 --> 21:30.880
to educate you about this.

21:30.880 --> 21:33.120
Every office has a weird food DMZ

21:33.120 --> 21:35.440
where if you have a pizza on your desk,

21:36.640 --> 21:37.840
no one will touch it.

21:37.840 --> 21:38.960
It would be weird.

21:38.960 --> 21:42.400
There is a table or a region in your office

21:42.400 --> 21:45.200
where if you put a food product, it will disappear.

21:45.200 --> 21:46.240
Have a pizza, give a pizza,

21:46.240 --> 21:47.840
and eat a pizza, take a pizza.

21:47.840 --> 21:48.320
Exactly.

21:48.320 --> 21:50.480
This Yahoo that I'm going to read now

21:50.480 --> 21:52.640
without permission because I don't need it.

21:54.080 --> 21:55.360
Well, I want to read this one first.

21:55.360 --> 21:57.040
It was sent in by Zoe Kinski climbing that ladder.

21:57.040 --> 21:57.440
Thank you.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.440
Just to continue the trend of us

22:00.800 --> 22:03.520
eating the snake's tail that is Yahoo Answer.

22:04.800 --> 22:08.000
It's asked by Yahoo Answers user Zach K who asks,

22:08.000 --> 22:09.840
who is your favorite McElroy?

22:09.840 --> 22:14.160
Now, this is in entertainment and music celebrities.

22:14.160 --> 22:16.080
Did you guys hear that?

22:16.080 --> 22:17.440
Did you guys hear what Yahoo called us?

22:19.040 --> 22:22.000
Zach says, mine is probably Justin,

22:22.000 --> 22:23.120
but it's hard to say.

22:23.120 --> 22:23.840
How about you?

22:24.400 --> 22:24.900
Yeah.

22:26.240 --> 22:28.160
And then this was sent in actually,

22:28.160 --> 22:29.840
this was asked four years ago.

22:31.120 --> 22:33.120
So we, I mean, we were just starting out.

22:33.120 --> 22:34.480
I was evolved since then.

22:34.480 --> 22:35.520
You can't compare Justin.

22:35.520 --> 22:36.240
Yeah, I was gonna say,

22:36.880 --> 22:38.000
we're completely different people.

22:38.000 --> 22:40.400
I've got three new exoskeletons since then.

22:40.400 --> 22:41.120
Yeah, that's true.

22:42.720 --> 22:45.120
Samantha G responded and said,

22:45.120 --> 22:47.200
what is a McElroy?

22:47.200 --> 22:47.840
There it is.

22:48.560 --> 22:49.760
That's appropriate.

22:49.760 --> 22:51.680
That's the question right there, Samantha.

22:51.680 --> 22:52.160
Woof.

22:52.160 --> 22:53.520
Have you figured it out?

22:53.520 --> 22:54.000
You tell me.

22:54.000 --> 22:54.880
I'm right to the quick.

22:54.880 --> 22:56.480
How about this other Zoe Kinski one though?

22:56.480 --> 22:57.760
It's asked by Yahoo Answers.

22:57.760 --> 22:58.640
Nope, something went wrong.

22:58.640 --> 22:59.600
Can't tell you who asked it.

23:00.320 --> 23:02.800
Jerrsh asks.

23:02.800 --> 23:03.760
It's me, Jerrshi.

23:04.320 --> 23:05.760
Jerrshi asks,

23:05.760 --> 23:08.640
what could happen to me if I mix my blood with kangaroo blood?

23:08.640 --> 23:09.520
Please, I want to know.

23:13.280 --> 23:14.320
That's one of two things.

23:15.680 --> 23:17.760
One is you get super jumping powers.

23:17.760 --> 23:20.960
Absolutely, or pouching powers, punching powers.

23:20.960 --> 23:23.120
This is where you get the second option,

23:23.120 --> 23:27.440
which is you start to take on physical characteristics

23:27.440 --> 23:28.960
of a kangaroo.

23:28.960 --> 23:30.880
So one is like you get kind of like

23:30.880 --> 23:34.080
just the powers related to though you still remain human.

23:34.080 --> 23:34.800
Okay.

23:34.800 --> 23:37.200
Second is you start to do like a fly

23:37.200 --> 23:41.760
or island of Dr. Moreau style like transformation.

23:41.760 --> 23:42.160
Can I-

23:42.160 --> 23:43.840
Oh, the third option is you die.

23:43.840 --> 23:44.640
Full body death.

23:45.280 --> 23:47.600
Just full, just complete full body death.

23:47.600 --> 23:48.080
From-

23:48.080 --> 23:50.640
Your soul escapes from your mortal coil.

23:50.640 --> 23:55.120
From toe to tip, from stern to bow, fully dead.

23:55.120 --> 23:56.000
But you know what?

23:56.000 --> 23:57.600
There is no science without risk.

23:57.600 --> 23:58.240
That's a good point.

23:59.040 --> 24:00.960
Isn't this what Kangaroo Jack was about?

24:00.960 --> 24:01.200
Yep.

24:01.200 --> 24:02.720
I didn't see it, but I'm pretty sure-

24:02.720 --> 24:06.560
No, Kangaroo Jack was about convincing a nation

24:06.560 --> 24:08.640
that it was about a talking kangaroo

24:08.640 --> 24:11.360
when it was not at all about a talking kangaroo.

24:11.360 --> 24:11.920
No, it was about-

24:11.920 --> 24:13.520
You're still really raw about this, huh?

24:13.520 --> 24:14.480
It was about apartheid.

24:17.920 --> 24:20.720
Just like Jaws isn't a movie about a shark.

24:20.720 --> 24:21.360
It's about apartheid.

24:21.360 --> 24:24.320
Kangaroo Jack, it's about apartheid.

24:24.880 --> 24:26.000
A lot of movies about apartheid

24:26.000 --> 24:27.200
and a lot of people miss out on that

24:27.200 --> 24:29.200
because it's like sometimes it's just below the surface,

24:29.200 --> 24:30.160
much like Jaws himself.

24:30.160 --> 24:32.560
And Kangaroo Jack, nobody actually saw that flick

24:32.560 --> 24:34.160
because they're like, they saw the trailers

24:34.160 --> 24:36.560
and they said, I would rather do something else.

24:36.560 --> 24:38.320
I've had my fill of Kangaroo Jack, thank you.

24:38.320 --> 24:40.720
I think I get it, but you don't get it.

24:40.720 --> 24:41.680
Because there's a lot,

24:41.680 --> 24:44.320
that movie had a lot of really, really poignant stuff to say

24:44.320 --> 24:46.560
about R.E. apartheid.

24:46.560 --> 24:49.040
Excuse me, there's a Kangaroo Jack 2.

24:49.040 --> 24:50.640
Alert, alert, alert.

24:50.640 --> 24:52.160
There's a Kangaroo Jack 2.

24:52.160 --> 24:55.920
It's a full-length animated film called Kangaroo Jack Good Day USA.

24:55.920 --> 24:56.800
Alert.

24:56.800 --> 24:59.520
Does it mention why the kangaroo speaks?

24:59.520 --> 25:02.480
That'd be a pretty bad movie, Travis.

25:02.480 --> 25:03.840
Don't you think it would be a bad movie

25:03.840 --> 25:05.120
if the protagonist didn't speak?

25:05.120 --> 25:06.960
It would be more fun than what Kangaroo Jack actually was,

25:06.960 --> 25:10.080
which is a kangaroo that like accidentally steals a bag

25:10.080 --> 25:12.480
full of money from two bumbling idiots.

25:12.480 --> 25:14.880
And then they chase the kangaroo through the desert.

25:14.880 --> 25:17.280
There's no rapping, there's no dancing,

25:17.280 --> 25:20.560
there's no talking as would be indicated by the trailer.

25:20.560 --> 25:23.920
So no, Griffin, I think it would be a pretty good movie.

25:23.920 --> 25:25.200
Thank you very much.

25:25.200 --> 25:30.240
As near as I can tell, he does speak in the animated film.

25:30.240 --> 25:32.720
I mean, he has an actor playing him.

25:32.720 --> 25:33.600
Let's put it that way.

25:33.600 --> 25:36.240
But that could just be making kangaroo noises.

25:36.240 --> 25:36.800
That's true.

25:36.800 --> 25:39.200
This is a good, I don't know why you pay somebody to do this.

25:39.200 --> 25:41.760
Normally you just get like whoever's around.

25:41.760 --> 25:43.040
Like Jimmy the intern.

25:43.040 --> 25:44.720
Like, Jimmy, let me hear your kangaroo.

25:44.720 --> 25:45.840
That's pretty convincing.

25:46.480 --> 25:47.600
I guess my question is like,

25:47.600 --> 25:50.080
why would they get an Australian animal

25:50.880 --> 25:52.400
to do this movie about apartheid?

25:52.400 --> 25:59.520
I'm not sure Kangaroo Jack G'day USA is about apartheid.

25:59.520 --> 26:02.400
No, no, no, the squeak will is not about apartheid,

26:02.400 --> 26:02.960
which is weird.

26:02.960 --> 26:05.600
That's why that one actually has a very low score

26:05.600 --> 26:07.280
on Rotten Tomatoes and IMDb.

26:07.280 --> 26:09.200
And it's just because people like the people

26:09.200 --> 26:13.600
who saw Kangaroo Jack the first one were moved by it.

26:15.120 --> 26:17.600
It was an important film that came out at just the right time.

26:17.600 --> 26:18.720
And then the second one came out

26:18.720 --> 26:20.480
and I think he played basketball or something.

26:20.480 --> 26:22.560
And it was like, I don't, it's weird.

26:22.560 --> 26:24.160
It's like if they made a Schindler's List too,

26:24.160 --> 26:26.400
but like he opened up a yogurt shop or something.

26:26.400 --> 26:27.520
And it was animated.

26:27.520 --> 26:28.800
And it was animated.

26:28.800 --> 26:29.840
Also, he's a kangaroo.

26:30.400 --> 26:33.760
Alert, alert, I have a nine out of 10 review

26:34.480 --> 26:38.080
for Kangaroo Jack G'day USA from an IMDb user.

26:38.720 --> 26:39.760
Here it is right now.

26:39.760 --> 26:42.400
This is from the reviewer 1204.

26:42.400 --> 26:45.280
Just today, I've seen this movie on Cartoon Network by surprise

26:45.280 --> 26:46.560
and knowing Kangaroo Jack,

26:46.560 --> 26:49.760
I risked watching it to find it isn't utter crap,

26:49.760 --> 26:52.720
which Cartoon Network and Nick often put on television.

26:52.720 --> 26:54.000
As it was on Cartoon Network,

26:54.000 --> 26:57.680
I found and knew it was going to be an animated course

26:57.680 --> 26:59.200
on the KJ franchise.

26:59.200 --> 27:03.440
First course this evening in a moose bush, if you will.

27:03.440 --> 27:06.320
Kangaroo Jack 2, ballin' in the USA.

27:07.200 --> 27:09.280
I watched this beginning to end

27:09.280 --> 27:11.600
and found it very good in overall

27:11.600 --> 27:14.000
and had no flaws to truly point out.

27:14.000 --> 27:14.640
There were laughs.

27:14.640 --> 27:16.000
Why wasn't it 10 out of 10?

27:16.800 --> 27:19.600
There were laughs course, as well as other things in the movie.

27:19.600 --> 27:22.080
The movie's beginning, I roughly missed though

27:22.080 --> 27:25.840
and was led up into 10 minutes or so into the movie

27:25.840 --> 27:27.760
and I really wouldn't want to watch it again

27:27.760 --> 27:28.880
just for those few minutes.

27:29.520 --> 27:30.720
Wait, okay.

27:30.720 --> 27:34.000
This person bobs and weaves between, eh,

27:34.000 --> 27:37.680
and it was awesome so quickly that I'm like,

27:37.680 --> 27:40.160
I either want to know why it wasn't 10 out of 10

27:40.160 --> 27:42.160
or why it wasn't four out of 10.

27:42.160 --> 27:45.280
Small disclaimer, I am a huge Scott Adams fan.

27:45.280 --> 27:46.480
That's neither here nor there.

27:46.480 --> 27:48.000
I just wanted to get it out there.

27:48.000 --> 27:51.520
I truly hope they make a sequel or even a television series.

27:51.520 --> 27:52.640
I'd watch it.

27:52.640 --> 27:54.960
And I'm sure enough demand would be available.

27:54.960 --> 27:58.320
Until then, I can only hope or even write.

27:58.320 --> 28:00.400
Maybe a fan fiction is due, eh?

28:00.400 --> 28:01.760
Well, that's my comments.

28:01.760 --> 28:03.360
It's time to run off for me.

28:03.360 --> 28:05.840
It's time to die.

28:05.840 --> 28:09.120
You know, there's not enough internet posts

28:09.120 --> 28:12.960
where people are like, well, I've typed long enough, friends.

28:12.960 --> 28:15.360
I must, uh, TTYL.

28:15.360 --> 28:18.400
I must retire to my boudoir for the evening,

28:18.400 --> 28:22.480
but thank you for joining me for my IMDB review

28:22.480 --> 28:23.760
of Kangaroo Jack.

28:25.520 --> 28:27.200
Like, he would stop the sentence before that

28:27.200 --> 28:28.880
and so he'd be like, there's gotta be more.

28:28.880 --> 28:32.000
My concubines have drawn my evening bath.

28:32.000 --> 28:33.520
I must, I must away.

28:34.400 --> 28:36.960
Time to report to the White House for duty.

28:36.960 --> 28:38.160
Goodbye, everybody.

28:38.880 --> 28:41.840
I believe Jackson has your petticoat, Jackson.

28:41.840 --> 28:44.000
Fetch this gentleman's outer garments.

28:44.000 --> 28:48.160
I, I have expired all my energy for the evening.

28:48.160 --> 28:51.520
Sir, you exhaust yourself writing these reviews.

28:51.520 --> 28:53.520
They must know, Jackson.

28:53.520 --> 28:54.560
They must know.

28:54.560 --> 28:55.920
Sir, you're killing yourself.

28:55.920 --> 28:57.520
Sir, think of your consumption.

28:58.800 --> 29:00.640
Come for a rest in the drawing room.

29:00.640 --> 29:02.240
Nay, I say.

29:02.240 --> 29:04.560
I have so little time left on this earth.

29:06.160 --> 29:10.400
I must get the word out about Kangaroo Jack to good day.

29:10.400 --> 29:12.800
To good day, USA.

29:12.800 --> 29:17.200
I am, there's a, there's a lot of discussion

29:17.200 --> 29:21.280
about this film on the message boards of IMDB,

29:21.280 --> 29:24.720
by which I mean one post titled Gay Day USA.

29:26.720 --> 29:28.880
That's how my mind read it before I look closer.

29:28.880 --> 29:30.800
It's always funny when I barely glance at things.

29:31.520 --> 29:34.160
So somebody was like, well, that was funny

29:34.160 --> 29:34.880
what just happened to me.

29:34.880 --> 29:36.640
I've gotta get this on the internet.

29:36.640 --> 29:37.920
You know who would love this?

29:37.920 --> 29:38.640
Everyone.

29:38.640 --> 29:41.760
This episode has been a real treatise on modern criticism.

29:42.400 --> 29:43.520
You think about it.

29:43.520 --> 29:44.320
Who's doing it best?

29:44.320 --> 29:45.440
Who's doing it right?

29:45.440 --> 29:48.320
Chelsea Loves Reliant K is her name.

29:48.320 --> 29:49.840
Should we take it to the money zone?

29:49.840 --> 29:50.720
Yeah, I think we should.

30:01.040 --> 30:02.560
What are we on the money zone today, Travis?

30:03.200 --> 30:07.040
Well, first, my brother, my brother and me are sponsored by Harry's.

30:07.040 --> 30:08.880
We've talked about Harry's.com before,

30:08.880 --> 30:11.440
and we'll talk about it again right now.

30:11.440 --> 30:15.280
Harry's.com offers razors that are so high quality

30:15.280 --> 30:18.000
that it will blow your face off, except not.

30:18.000 --> 30:19.040
Don't say that.

30:19.040 --> 30:20.640
That's not a thing they want to be said.

30:20.640 --> 30:22.320
It'll make your face look awesome.

30:22.320 --> 30:22.800
How about that?

30:22.800 --> 30:23.840
Is that better?

30:23.840 --> 30:25.920
It's better for your face and your wallet.

30:25.920 --> 30:26.880
That's the twist.

30:28.560 --> 30:31.600
What about my legs and my butt?

30:31.600 --> 30:33.280
It's good for your legs, good for your butt,

30:33.280 --> 30:35.680
good for your pits, good for your forearms,

30:35.680 --> 30:39.440
good for your unibrow, good for the back of your neck,

30:40.000 --> 30:40.800
good for your back.

30:41.440 --> 30:43.280
What about the inside of my dog body?

30:43.920 --> 30:44.560
Done.

30:44.560 --> 30:44.880
Okay.

30:46.000 --> 30:47.520
All of it, all of it.

30:47.520 --> 30:48.720
And here's the thing, Griffin.

30:48.720 --> 30:50.880
You can get a starter set, which includes a razor,

30:50.880 --> 30:52.800
foaming shave gel or shave cream,

30:52.800 --> 30:56.400
and three razor blades, plus free shipping for $15.

30:57.280 --> 30:58.320
Oh, shit.

30:59.680 --> 31:02.800
If you've ever bought a razor in a store before,

31:02.800 --> 31:07.520
you know how ridiculously inexpensive that is by comparison.

31:08.720 --> 31:10.320
You could expect to spend that much

31:10.320 --> 31:12.160
just buying a set of blades.

31:12.720 --> 31:14.560
Sorry, Trav, nothing doing.

31:15.280 --> 31:16.320
Still too much.

31:16.320 --> 31:16.880
Still too much?

31:16.880 --> 31:17.840
Still too expensive.

31:17.840 --> 31:22.080
Okay, Justin, what if through some, I don't know, magic,

31:22.080 --> 31:24.000
some kind of financial wizardry,

31:24.000 --> 31:28.000
I was able to shave one third of the price off?

31:28.000 --> 31:30.640
It's me, the deals warlock.

31:30.640 --> 31:32.320
I have appeared.

31:32.320 --> 31:35.280
I have heard your wish and I have appeared from the ether.

31:35.280 --> 31:36.400
Don't make the deal with him.

31:36.400 --> 31:37.760
It always turns bad.

31:37.760 --> 31:41.280
I shall sell you cheaper blades.

31:42.320 --> 31:43.440
What are you looking for?

31:43.440 --> 31:44.480
Justin, don't do it.

31:44.480 --> 31:45.920
Would you like a scimitar?

31:46.720 --> 31:47.200
An epi?

31:47.200 --> 31:48.160
What's this here about?

31:48.800 --> 31:52.480
What kind of blade are you in the market for, dear sirs?

31:52.480 --> 31:55.840
From me, Garfield, the deals warlock.

31:56.880 --> 31:58.320
Well, deals warlock, what I-

31:58.320 --> 32:04.160
Call me Garfield, shimity-bippity-sippity-shee.

32:06.720 --> 32:09.760
I have cast a spell on all of your belongings

32:09.760 --> 32:11.920
and now they all cost less.

32:12.720 --> 32:16.720
If you try to trade it, don't try and sell your car now

32:16.720 --> 32:20.400
for I have reduced its price in the blue books.

32:23.200 --> 32:26.880
So Garfield, I would like to pay $10 for this starter kit.

32:26.880 --> 32:28.800
Call me the deals warlock.

32:29.440 --> 32:32.000
No, hold on just a darn minute.

32:32.000 --> 32:33.360
Did I say something to offend you?

32:33.920 --> 32:36.960
No, you just change it every time.

32:38.720 --> 32:40.080
I am inscrutable.

32:40.960 --> 32:41.920
I'll try to keep up.

32:41.920 --> 32:45.280
So how can I save $5 off this starter set?

32:45.280 --> 32:48.880
I shall prepare the incantation kit.

32:48.880 --> 32:52.000
Or you could just go to harrys.com

32:52.000 --> 32:55.200
and use the promo code MYBROTHER, all one word,

32:55.200 --> 32:57.280
and you could get that starter kit for $10.

32:58.080 --> 33:02.080
I just controlled Travis's brain to make him say that.

33:02.640 --> 33:06.080
I have conjured the spell into his brain and his mouth.

33:06.080 --> 33:09.760
I was inside of his mouth and it was very clean.

33:09.760 --> 33:11.440
I was gonna say it anyways.

33:11.440 --> 33:12.800
I'm inside your mouth.

33:13.600 --> 33:15.440
My Brother, My Brother, Me is also supported

33:15.440 --> 33:17.920
in part by Squarespace, the all-in-one website platform

33:17.920 --> 33:20.480
that makes it easy and fast

33:20.480 --> 33:23.280
to create your own professional website.

33:23.280 --> 33:25.040
Squarespace has beautiful templates.

33:25.040 --> 33:27.440
They've got integration with Google apps and Getty Images

33:27.440 --> 33:29.520
and a feature called Cover Pages.

33:29.520 --> 33:31.520
I've actually been thinking about making a website

33:31.520 --> 33:32.880
with Squarespace myself

33:32.880 --> 33:35.040
for YouTube serious things about it sheets.

33:35.040 --> 33:37.360
I'm holding off until they have integration with Getty Lee.

33:38.560 --> 33:41.520
You can get a free trial with no credit card required.

33:41.520 --> 33:44.400
You could use the coupon code MYBROTHER, all one word,

33:44.400 --> 33:46.880
for 10% off your first purchase.

33:47.520 --> 33:48.720
And now I away.

33:49.360 --> 33:50.240
Farewell.

33:50.240 --> 33:51.520
Save the cat life.

33:51.520 --> 33:52.880
No, you stay here.

33:52.880 --> 33:54.560
You read the next one, wizard.

33:54.560 --> 33:56.400
Squarespace, build it beautiful.

33:57.600 --> 33:59.440
I must, but I must away.

33:59.440 --> 34:02.480
No, Warlock, what is our next, what's our next ad?

34:02.480 --> 34:05.280
There's a red Tad saying let's Michael's.

34:06.000 --> 34:07.440
Hey guys, it's Griffin, I'm back.

34:07.440 --> 34:08.080
Oh, thank God.

34:09.120 --> 34:12.000
This message is for Illustration.

34:12.000 --> 34:13.840
I think it's Illustrate Ian.

34:13.840 --> 34:14.880
Illustrate Ian.

34:14.880 --> 34:16.800
Well, it's spelled like illustration,

34:16.800 --> 34:19.120
but with an A at the end instead of an O.

34:19.120 --> 34:20.720
Because the guy who does it is named Ian.

34:21.440 --> 34:23.200
Well, agree to disagree.

34:23.200 --> 34:26.800
Okay, Illustrate Ian is doing portrait commissions,

34:26.800 --> 34:28.320
which make great gifts.

34:28.320 --> 34:30.960
He specializes in D&D character portraits.

34:30.960 --> 34:33.600
He won our adventure zone art contest

34:33.600 --> 34:35.360
and he made my Twitter avatar,

34:36.000 --> 34:37.840
which actually, no, that's no longer true

34:37.840 --> 34:40.080
because now my Twitter avatar is Chaz the dog,

34:40.080 --> 34:42.400
but he made my former Twitter avatar,

34:42.400 --> 34:44.880
which was me floating surrounded by dice

34:44.880 --> 34:48.080
and I have like bony rock protrusions coming out of my body.

34:48.080 --> 34:49.360
It was totally radical.

34:49.360 --> 34:50.160
It was really great.

34:50.160 --> 34:52.400
He's available for freelance illustration work.

34:52.400 --> 34:54.800
If you want it drawed, he will draw it.

34:54.800 --> 34:57.680
Again, that's Illustrate Ian, I-A-N.

34:58.160 --> 35:00.880
If you go to illustration.com slash commish

35:00.880 --> 35:04.960
and subscribe to Illustrate Ian on Instagram,

35:04.960 --> 35:06.800
you can enter for a chance to win

35:06.800 --> 35:09.280
a monthly full body portrait giveaway.

35:09.280 --> 35:09.840
Go check it out.

35:09.840 --> 35:11.600
It really is good artworks.

35:11.600 --> 35:13.920
And I liked it for a very, very long time,

35:13.920 --> 35:15.920
and now I'm a dog and I didn't want to confuse people.

35:16.720 --> 35:18.800
Our next message is for Gracie Girl.

35:18.800 --> 35:21.440
And it's from your man.

35:22.080 --> 35:23.760
And your man says,

35:23.760 --> 35:25.040
for our anniversary,

35:25.040 --> 35:26.720
I got the brothers to shout your name

35:26.720 --> 35:27.840
from the microphone tops

35:27.840 --> 35:30.480
and acknowledge you as the long lost sister.

35:30.480 --> 35:32.080
I'm using the brothers

35:32.080 --> 35:34.080
for what they were originally intended for

35:34.080 --> 35:37.520
and best suited to as a mouthpiece for love.

35:37.520 --> 35:40.880
I've enjoyed nothing more than the last five years together.

35:40.880 --> 35:42.640
Here is to infinity more.

35:42.640 --> 35:44.720
P.S. Moe is the best dog.

35:46.160 --> 35:46.800
Is the dog gonna-

35:46.800 --> 35:49.680
I feel like that was like the last sentence.

35:49.680 --> 35:50.480
That was all very sweet.

35:50.480 --> 35:54.880
And the last sentence was like a hidden secret,

35:54.880 --> 35:58.160
like barb in an ongoing argument about best dogs.

35:58.160 --> 35:59.280
Also fuck your dog.

35:59.280 --> 36:00.480
My dog's the best.

36:00.480 --> 36:01.920
Nana Nana Boo Boo.

36:01.920 --> 36:04.560
P.S. Moe rules and Bethany drools.

36:06.720 --> 36:08.560
Bethany is a great name for a dog, Justin.

36:08.560 --> 36:10.160
You should be a professional dog namer.

36:11.200 --> 36:12.000
Thank you.

36:12.000 --> 36:13.200
You should work at a pound

36:13.200 --> 36:14.720
and just walk down the line going like,

36:14.720 --> 36:15.680
that's a Bethany.

36:15.680 --> 36:17.520
That's a Michelle.

36:17.520 --> 36:21.120
Name any dog and I will rename it for you.

36:21.120 --> 36:21.680
Buttercup.

36:22.320 --> 36:23.280
Cup butter.

36:23.280 --> 36:24.000
That was way better.

36:24.000 --> 36:24.480
Next.

36:24.480 --> 36:25.920
Comet from Full House.

36:25.920 --> 36:26.400
Air Bud.

36:26.960 --> 36:27.600
Okay.

36:27.600 --> 36:28.560
Was that the same dog?

36:30.960 --> 36:31.360
Air Bud.

36:31.360 --> 36:32.320
Spiritually at least.

36:32.320 --> 36:33.040
Air Bud the dog.

36:33.040 --> 36:33.440
No it was.

36:33.440 --> 36:34.080
It was the same dog.

36:34.080 --> 36:36.160
Air Bud the dog's from Air Bud.

36:36.160 --> 36:40.720
They replaced Air Bud for Golden Receiver

36:40.720 --> 36:45.040
because the original Air Bud slash Comet got paw cancer.

36:45.040 --> 36:46.640
Oh Justin.

36:46.640 --> 36:47.920
Welcome to our comedy show.

36:47.920 --> 36:53.280
Those are the two saddest words I've ever heard put together

36:53.280 --> 36:54.160
before in my life.

36:56.480 --> 36:59.600
I could meditate for years on a mountaintop in a cave

36:59.600 --> 37:00.960
trying to think of two sad words

37:00.960 --> 37:02.080
and I would come out

37:02.080 --> 37:04.240
and I would be like child disease

37:04.240 --> 37:05.600
and you'd be like no paw cancer.

37:05.600 --> 37:06.240
What's up?

37:06.240 --> 37:07.040
Sadder than that.

37:09.520 --> 37:10.400
That wasn't a joke.

37:10.400 --> 37:11.280
It's actually what happened.

37:11.280 --> 37:12.320
I know it's not a joke.

37:12.320 --> 37:16.560
Jokes make you laugh typically.

37:16.560 --> 37:17.280
This is Biz.

37:17.280 --> 37:18.160
And I'm Teresa.

37:18.160 --> 37:20.480
And we host a show called One Bad Mother,

37:20.480 --> 37:22.560
a comedy podcast about parenting.

37:22.560 --> 37:24.560
Not a parenting podcast.

37:24.560 --> 37:25.440
Guess what?

37:25.440 --> 37:27.040
We both just had babies.

37:27.600 --> 37:28.000
Again.

37:29.280 --> 37:31.920
Check out the show enjoyed by breeders and ballers alike

37:31.920 --> 37:35.200
on iTunes or maximumfun.org.

37:35.200 --> 37:36.960
I recently started a new job

37:36.960 --> 37:40.320
and I have been trained by an older and more experienced co-worker.

37:40.320 --> 37:41.680
She recently spent a great deal,

37:41.680 --> 37:42.880
wait a lady boss?

37:44.000 --> 37:45.920
That wasn't gonna fit anywhere on my button.

37:45.920 --> 37:47.760
Gonna redesign my whole button now.

37:47.760 --> 37:48.400
Thanks a lot.

37:49.200 --> 37:50.640
She recently spent a great deal of time

37:50.640 --> 37:52.880
showing me how to complete our billing process

37:52.880 --> 37:55.600
the old fashioned way with pen and paper.

37:55.600 --> 37:56.160
That's right.

37:56.720 --> 37:58.960
Afterwards, I quickly created an Excel spreadsheet

37:58.960 --> 38:00.640
that completed all the work almost instantly.

38:01.920 --> 38:03.760
I feel like I should show her how

38:03.760 --> 38:05.680
she could be doing her work more efficiently

38:05.680 --> 38:07.360
but I'm worried I might hurt her feelings

38:07.360 --> 38:10.160
or make her feel stupid as she's not very tech savvy.

38:10.160 --> 38:12.080
Should I let her keep doing things her way

38:12.080 --> 38:13.920
or bring her into the 21st century?

38:13.920 --> 38:15.120
Important context.

38:15.120 --> 38:17.840
We are funded by your tax dollars.

38:17.840 --> 38:19.760
That's from cautious kid in Chicago.

38:20.560 --> 38:21.120
Shit.

38:21.120 --> 38:22.400
Oh, this is tough.

38:22.400 --> 38:23.440
Think of it this way though.

38:23.440 --> 38:26.560
If you get her on this system and this is her whole job,

38:26.560 --> 38:30.320
it sounds like if she's spending this much time spreading sheets

38:30.320 --> 38:31.760
and you can teach her to knock that shit out

38:31.760 --> 38:33.200
in like 15 minutes with Excel

38:33.200 --> 38:34.880
and that saves her from a whole day's work.

38:34.880 --> 38:36.160
She can spend the rest of that day

38:36.160 --> 38:38.160
just like blazing it and playing Halo.

38:38.160 --> 38:40.320
But Griffin, counterpoint,

38:40.320 --> 38:42.160
what if you start to show it to her

38:42.160 --> 38:44.400
and she just like can't like,

38:44.400 --> 38:47.360
she's like, no, I don't like Excel.

38:47.360 --> 38:48.400
I don't want to do this.

38:49.600 --> 38:52.160
And now she knows that there's a better way

38:52.160 --> 38:54.320
that she cannot like do

38:54.880 --> 38:57.760
and she's stuck in a pen and paper prison.

38:57.760 --> 38:59.120
Then she'll be swallowed up

38:59.120 --> 39:00.800
and devoured by the free market

39:00.800 --> 39:02.960
and digested and turned into the fuel

39:02.960 --> 39:05.280
that burns to power our economy, Travis.

39:05.280 --> 39:09.440
In case you have never worked anywhere,

39:09.440 --> 39:10.960
let me tell you how this short story ends.

39:10.960 --> 39:13.120
You show her how to make the quicker spreadsheets.

39:13.120 --> 39:15.200
She starts making the quicker spreadsheets.

39:15.200 --> 39:18.240
Her bosses realize that she's not doing anything all day.

39:18.240 --> 39:19.200
She gets fired.

39:19.200 --> 39:20.960
You end up doing all the spreadsheets.

39:20.960 --> 39:23.280
Guaranteed, this is how it shakes out.

39:23.280 --> 39:25.120
Just let her keep doing her thing,

39:25.120 --> 39:26.080
wasting your tax dollars.

39:26.080 --> 39:28.560
Think of it, for every week or so of work

39:28.560 --> 39:29.840
that we pay this woman for

39:29.840 --> 39:32.000
that she could be doing with computers,

39:32.000 --> 39:33.920
that's another drone the government can't buy.

39:33.920 --> 39:36.240
So you're like helping.

39:37.360 --> 39:39.520
You're helping in a way, in a weird sort of way.

39:40.160 --> 39:40.560
Maybe.

39:40.560 --> 39:42.160
There is also something to be said.

39:42.160 --> 39:45.040
Or maybe you're taking fuel out of the rocket to Mars.

39:45.040 --> 39:46.240
I have no idea.

39:46.240 --> 39:47.680
There's also something to be said though

39:47.680 --> 39:49.840
for the fact that this person was doing their job

39:49.840 --> 39:51.280
before you got there.

39:51.280 --> 39:55.520
And like, unless every day the boss was walking up to her

39:55.520 --> 39:58.160
and saying like, still taking forever, huh Deborah?

39:58.160 --> 39:58.560
Okay.

39:59.120 --> 40:02.160
Like she's was doing this before you got there

40:02.160 --> 40:03.920
and seemingly was doing fine.

40:03.920 --> 40:05.680
So it's super cool that you have a way

40:05.680 --> 40:07.280
that moves much faster.

40:07.280 --> 40:10.240
And if the opportunity presents itself,

40:10.240 --> 40:11.200
if she's ever like,

40:11.200 --> 40:13.280
how do you seem to be getting it done so much quicker?

40:13.280 --> 40:15.120
Be like, oh, I use this Excel spreadsheet.

40:15.120 --> 40:16.880
Do you want me to show you how to do it?

40:16.880 --> 40:17.760
Great, awesome.

40:17.760 --> 40:19.840
Now you've totally gotten in and you could do that.

40:19.840 --> 40:21.120
But until that happens,

40:21.120 --> 40:23.680
she seems like she was perfectly happy doing it her way.

40:24.480 --> 40:26.960
You know how in that one episode of Doug,

40:26.960 --> 40:28.880
Doug's dad makes him a boring kite

40:28.880 --> 40:30.560
and all the other kids have cool kites?

40:30.560 --> 40:31.040
Yeah.

40:31.040 --> 40:32.960
And Doug thinks the kite sucks.

40:32.960 --> 40:35.280
So he tries to add like wings and flare to it.

40:35.280 --> 40:35.600
Classic.

40:35.600 --> 40:36.400
And his dad's like,

40:37.200 --> 40:39.600
do you remember what his dad says it actually was Trav?

40:39.600 --> 40:41.120
It was a racing kite.

40:41.120 --> 40:42.240
It was a fighter kite.

40:42.240 --> 40:43.280
Fighter kite, that's right.

40:43.280 --> 40:44.320
A fighter kite.

40:44.960 --> 40:46.960
Maybe this is that sort of scenario.

40:46.960 --> 40:49.760
She knows about your computer method.

40:49.760 --> 40:51.280
She's got a fighter spreadsheet.

40:51.280 --> 40:52.800
And with your method, she's like,

40:52.800 --> 40:54.560
oh yeah, I've heard about that.

40:54.560 --> 40:57.760
Go check the files you already done.

40:57.760 --> 40:58.560
I can't find them.

40:58.560 --> 40:59.040
That's right.

40:59.040 --> 41:00.720
Our computers delete everything every day.

41:00.720 --> 41:00.880
Right.

41:00.880 --> 41:02.880
That's why you've been wasting your time.

41:02.880 --> 41:05.600
Oh, our computers turned against us in 2008.

41:05.600 --> 41:08.640
When Y2KXV happens and it's happening.

41:08.640 --> 41:10.080
Oh, read the literature.

41:10.080 --> 41:12.080
Oh my God, get online, read the literature.

41:12.080 --> 41:12.880
Lose change three.

41:12.880 --> 41:13.680
Lose change three.

41:13.680 --> 41:15.200
Kim Trails and Y2KXV.

41:16.240 --> 41:17.040
It's gonna happen.

41:17.040 --> 41:19.120
And then when that happens, what happened to your spreadsheets?

41:19.120 --> 41:23.120
They got gobbled up by the internet's Satan demons.

41:23.120 --> 41:24.400
But what happened to hers?

41:24.400 --> 41:24.720
Nothing.

41:24.720 --> 41:25.680
They're fine.

41:25.680 --> 41:28.560
You'll be visiting her on a throne of spreadsheets.

41:28.560 --> 41:34.400
She'll be trading spreadsheets for sexual favors with her war boys.

41:34.400 --> 41:35.360
Beautiful concubines.

41:36.720 --> 41:37.840
These aren't spreadsheets.

41:37.840 --> 41:39.440
These are fuck coupons.

41:44.880 --> 41:48.560
If I give you two pages of the Anderson file, we're doing it in the butt.

41:52.160 --> 41:53.040
That's the deal.

41:54.000 --> 41:55.680
That's the deal, Sandwalker.

41:55.680 --> 41:56.480
Take it or leave it.

41:56.480 --> 41:58.960
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

41:59.840 --> 42:00.400
Sure.

42:00.400 --> 42:02.400
This Yahoo was also sent in by Zoe Kinski.

42:02.400 --> 42:02.720
Thank you.

42:02.720 --> 42:04.080
Climbing that ladder, Zoe Kinski.

42:04.080 --> 42:06.720
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Smart Stuff, who asks,

42:09.280 --> 42:12.080
My husband is jealous of Guy Fieri.

42:13.840 --> 42:17.760
I absolutely love watching the Triple D.

42:20.480 --> 42:23.760
My husband thinks it's because I have a crush on Guy Fieri,

42:23.760 --> 42:27.200
which I do, but that's not why I watch it.

42:27.200 --> 42:28.560
Good eye, husband.

42:28.560 --> 42:30.560
I mean, he nailed it in one.

42:30.560 --> 42:35.920
He has diagnosed my Fieri desires.

42:35.920 --> 42:39.040
My question-

42:39.040 --> 42:41.840
Wait, my deep dark desire, my Triple D.

42:43.280 --> 42:46.640
My question, why is it that men get jealous of people on TV?

42:46.640 --> 42:49.280
I don't get jealous if he thinks someone is hot on a show.

42:49.280 --> 42:51.440
Do I stop watching out of respect to him?

42:51.440 --> 42:53.200
He's never been insecure in our marriage.

42:53.200 --> 42:56.880
And I really don't want him to think I'm being insensitive to his feelings.

42:57.760 --> 43:02.320
Also, this is posted in entertainment and music horror scopes.

43:02.320 --> 43:03.280
There it is.

43:03.280 --> 43:08.400
I think that the real problem here is not that your husband is jealous of someone on TV.

43:08.400 --> 43:15.760
He's deeply confused and disturbed by your choice of sexual fantasy.

43:17.440 --> 43:21.520
If you have a crush on, say, a George Clooney-esque person who-

43:21.520 --> 43:22.960
I can't be that.

43:22.960 --> 43:26.000
No, you see George Clooney and you think, I could be that someday.

43:26.000 --> 43:32.000
If my wife formed a crush on an Elijah Wood, I would be like, okay, I could probably swing that.

43:32.000 --> 43:33.600
You're Joseph Gordon-Levitt.

43:33.600 --> 43:34.080
You're Joseph-

43:34.080 --> 43:35.680
Well, no, now we're reaching for the stars.

43:35.680 --> 43:39.440
But on Elijah Wood, I could scratch that itch maybe someday if I drop a few LBs.

43:39.440 --> 43:40.080
I could do that.

43:40.080 --> 43:40.960
I could do that.

43:40.960 --> 43:42.080
I could do that.

43:42.080 --> 43:44.000
Guy Fieri, I can't become that.

43:44.000 --> 43:45.280
And I've become a dog.

43:46.240 --> 43:47.600
That's not doable.

43:48.800 --> 43:52.000
I don't know what sort of chemical peel action I will need.

43:52.000 --> 43:57.280
I saw somebody on Instagram post a picture of them sitting next to Guy Fieri on a plane,

43:57.280 --> 44:01.840
and that dude was passed out, sleeping forward, which, how does a body do that?

44:01.840 --> 44:04.000
I will never possess a body that can do that.

44:04.000 --> 44:07.280
Not only that, he had a trucker cap, and he had taken his trucker cap,

44:07.280 --> 44:13.920
and he had wedged it up into the cover for the plane's window

44:13.920 --> 44:18.080
so that his hat was in the window like he's giving his hat special treatment.

44:18.080 --> 44:18.960
Look at the sky.

44:18.960 --> 44:20.400
Look at the sky, you beautiful trucker hat.

44:20.400 --> 44:24.320
And what sort of mind thinks to do that?

44:24.320 --> 44:27.360
I'm on a plane, so I'm going to jam my hat into a window.

44:29.520 --> 44:30.640
I can never become Guy Fieri.

44:30.640 --> 44:33.600
I think it's the same sort of mind that thinks about making cheesecake with mozzarella bites

44:33.600 --> 44:34.320
or whatever the fuck that is.

44:34.320 --> 44:35.360
Right, that's what I'm saying.

44:35.360 --> 44:38.560
Let's make a margarita with the nachos already in it.

44:40.960 --> 44:42.240
Saves you time.

44:42.240 --> 44:50.480
If I take Guy Fieri's blood and I inject it into myself, I'll be burned from the inside out.

44:50.480 --> 44:55.840
To your question as to whether or not you should stop watching Guy Fieri, I mean, you can try.

44:55.840 --> 44:56.160
Yeah.

44:56.160 --> 45:04.240
As I've chronicled on my day-by-day life blog, Fieri Walk With Me, about my Guy Fieri addiction,

45:06.400 --> 45:10.640
I have tried many times to give him up, but it is impossible.

45:10.640 --> 45:17.760
Also, if you leave any show on the Food Network, once it concludes, Guy Fieri will appear.

45:17.760 --> 45:18.080
Yeah.

45:18.080 --> 45:23.280
Guy Fieri is the one who shakes you out of your food hypnosis.

45:23.280 --> 45:24.800
Oh, were you having a good time?

45:24.800 --> 45:25.440
Not anymore.

45:26.560 --> 45:30.640
People give Fieri a hard time, but he's a really good reminder that you should probably get out

45:30.640 --> 45:31.600
of the house today.

45:31.600 --> 45:35.680
Like, hey, it's 2 p.m. and you're still wearing pajamas.

45:35.680 --> 45:38.080
Maybe it's time to do something with this Saturday.

45:38.080 --> 45:42.560
Look at me, I'm incredibly successful for no other reason than I put on real clothes

45:42.560 --> 45:43.840
and left the house.

45:43.840 --> 45:49.760
This is the end of the Spring Baking Challenge marathon has arrived, and now maybe you should

45:49.760 --> 45:52.400
go out and do something in the garden.

45:52.400 --> 45:54.240
Have you called your loved ones?

45:54.240 --> 45:59.200
Hey, this is Guy Fieri and I just jumped into the barefoot contest's body like Agent Smith.

46:01.040 --> 46:01.680
Are you okay?

46:02.960 --> 46:03.920
I miss Alton Brown.

46:03.920 --> 46:07.600
It's too bad that his body got jumped into by Guy Fieri like Agent Smith,

46:07.600 --> 46:10.240
and he took over the show and he called it Bad Eats.

46:12.560 --> 46:15.360
And he called it like a version of Bad to the Bone when it came on.

46:15.360 --> 46:19.440
He changed the show's name to Not Eats, No Longer Eats.

46:20.800 --> 46:23.280
That's more of a warning than anything else.

46:23.280 --> 46:27.040
I'm a starving artist and currently working a pretty shitty job at a shooty restaurant.

46:27.040 --> 46:29.840
Wow, Jesus, Justin, you got like six of those words wrong, buddy.

46:29.840 --> 46:31.840
There are like 12 words in there and you gotta have one wrong.

46:31.840 --> 46:39.680
Okay, I'm a starving artist and currently working a pretty shitty day job at a sushi resta-

46:39.680 --> 46:42.000
You still didn't do great, yeah, yeah.

46:42.000 --> 46:44.560
It's a day job at a sushi restaurant.

46:44.560 --> 46:45.120
That's hard.

46:45.120 --> 46:46.720
Okay, you guys right now read that line.

46:46.720 --> 46:47.440
Travis, cold, go.

46:47.440 --> 46:49.200
A pretty shitty day job at a sushi restaurant.

46:49.200 --> 46:50.720
No, the whole sentence, the whole sentence.

46:50.720 --> 46:54.720
I am a starving artist and currently working a pretty shitty day job at a sushi restaurant.

46:55.360 --> 46:55.920
Fine, okay.

46:55.920 --> 46:58.640
It's both boring and hectic and it makes me incredibly anxious.

46:58.640 --> 47:01.040
I just got offered a job at a candy shop.

47:01.040 --> 47:04.640
It pays more, has better hours, and will be far less stressful.

47:04.640 --> 47:05.600
So here's my question.

47:06.720 --> 47:08.240
Why is there a question?

47:08.240 --> 47:11.040
Since the working hours for both jobs don't overlap,

47:11.040 --> 47:14.480
should I do both at once for a while and test the waters at the candy store?

47:14.480 --> 47:17.600
I don't want to leave this restaurant and find out the candy store is even rougher.

47:18.240 --> 47:21.040
And that's from I got 99 problems and two of them are jobs.

47:21.920 --> 47:25.040
Okay, this is my immediate takeaway from this.

47:25.760 --> 47:30.720
Your biggest concern about working at a candy store is going to have to be dealing with like

47:30.720 --> 47:32.080
shitty kids, right?

47:32.080 --> 47:35.200
Kids running around and like spoiled breath and that kind of thing, right?

47:35.200 --> 47:36.880
Now let me pose this.

47:36.880 --> 47:42.160
What sounds worse, that or the shitty people you would face working at a sushi restaurant

47:42.160 --> 47:45.840
who like ask way too many questions and are really spoiled adults?

47:45.840 --> 47:46.720
I'd rather deal with shitty kids.

47:46.720 --> 47:48.800
Is that what you think people who eat sushi are like?

47:49.600 --> 47:50.160
No, no, no.

47:50.160 --> 47:53.200
But I'm saying that like if you're talking about the negative, bad part of it.

47:53.200 --> 47:54.320
The bad seeds.

47:54.320 --> 47:57.600
Yeah, I'm saying if you're just talking about the shitty part of the job,

47:57.600 --> 48:01.920
it's the shitty people at the sushi store versus the shitty people at the candy store.

48:01.920 --> 48:05.840
I'd rather deal with the shitty people at the candy store because then you're still

48:05.840 --> 48:07.040
surrounded by candy.

48:07.680 --> 48:11.680
The last time I was at Candy Craze at the Huntington Mall, I was trying to find a certain

48:11.680 --> 48:15.840
kind of candy and it was, I didn't know the name of it, but I had like the texture and

48:15.840 --> 48:19.040
the flavor in my mind and I found something that I thought was it.

48:19.040 --> 48:22.320
A taste I remember from my childhood, right?

48:22.320 --> 48:23.200
I thought it was it.

48:23.200 --> 48:28.160
What I found out I was looking for was seafoam candy, but that's neither here nor there.

48:28.160 --> 48:28.880
This is not it.

48:28.880 --> 48:34.640
But I took a piece out before making, had this been the right candy, a considerable

48:34.640 --> 48:35.440
bulk purchase.

48:36.000 --> 48:42.240
And as I did it, the woman who was running the shop from the back, who I was sure I was

48:42.240 --> 48:50.480
out of eyesight, the woman running the shop from the back noscoped me and said, you gotta

48:50.480 --> 48:53.600
you gotta pay for the candy before you eat it.

48:53.600 --> 48:56.000
Oh, Justin, how did you feel in that moment?

48:56.000 --> 48:56.800
Take me inside.

48:56.800 --> 48:58.080
How did I feel for it?

48:58.080 --> 48:59.360
Let me take you inside.

48:59.360 --> 49:00.560
I have not been back.

49:00.560 --> 49:04.720
It's been eight months and I have to walk past a store called Candy Craze when I'm

49:04.720 --> 49:06.640
at my favorite place, the Huntington Mall.

49:06.640 --> 49:09.040
I have to walk past Candy Craze sheepishly.

49:09.680 --> 49:12.880
But in my head, I'm thinking I would have bought a lot of candy that day.

49:12.880 --> 49:13.520
You don't even know.

49:15.280 --> 49:19.440
You need to go in there and be like, listen, madam, if you would let me steal just a little

49:19.440 --> 49:23.920
bit of candy, if you had let me steal that initial piece of candy, I would have.

49:23.920 --> 49:25.200
Oh, the investment would have been so much bigger.

49:25.200 --> 49:29.200
Every other thing you on Earth, you could try before you buy.

49:29.200 --> 49:30.400
Check the margins on this.

49:30.400 --> 49:32.560
OK, I wanted a candy trailer.

49:32.560 --> 49:33.760
That's all I was looking for.

49:33.760 --> 49:36.000
OK, I wanted one sampler.

49:36.000 --> 49:36.160
Right.

49:36.160 --> 49:39.360
But you don't go to I was you don't go to Best Buy and be like, oh, I do want to buy

49:39.360 --> 49:41.040
that 52 inch plasma screen.

49:41.040 --> 49:43.840
But first, I'm going to steal these headphones.

49:43.840 --> 49:44.480
Is that OK?

49:44.480 --> 49:45.760
You know, but you go to the best.

49:45.760 --> 49:49.360
Nobody can look at the TV on the wall and you steal the remote control.

49:49.360 --> 49:52.640
And you take that home and now you've got to eat it.

49:54.400 --> 49:59.040
I would have spent I mean, I would have spent Plasma TV money on Seafoam candy.

49:59.040 --> 50:02.640
Give me three thousand dollars of Seafoam candy.

50:02.640 --> 50:04.880
I want to bathe in it like Scrooge McDuck.

50:05.680 --> 50:09.920
P.O. Box 54, Huntington, West Virginia, 25706.

50:09.920 --> 50:14.960
And if anybody can see if you can find pickle gum, send us that too, because I've been looking

50:14.960 --> 50:16.480
for it since I was like 12.

50:16.480 --> 50:20.640
If now I'll give you a warning, if it's melted Seafoam, I will hunt you down and kill you.

50:20.640 --> 50:21.120
Here it is.

50:21.120 --> 50:22.880
So here's the last thing I'll say about this question.

50:23.920 --> 50:28.160
The situation I feel bad for you in that situation, Justin, because you must have felt so,

50:28.160 --> 50:29.600
so very small.

50:29.600 --> 50:31.200
Oh, you must have felt like a borrower.

50:31.200 --> 50:32.640
I did feel small.

50:32.640 --> 50:33.120
Come on.

50:33.120 --> 50:35.840
I'm I'm a white, straight male in America.

50:35.840 --> 50:37.360
I've never heard no before.

50:37.360 --> 50:38.000
Right.

50:38.000 --> 50:38.800
Exactly.

50:38.800 --> 50:42.960
But think about how many white, straight males that woman had to say.

50:42.960 --> 50:45.120
You got to buy the candy before you can eat it, sir.

50:45.120 --> 50:46.560
That day.

50:46.560 --> 50:50.000
Oh, you think she goes home to her husband and she's like, I had to do it again.

50:50.000 --> 50:50.720
I had to.

50:50.720 --> 50:51.520
That was my point.

50:52.160 --> 50:53.120
I was getting around to it.

50:53.120 --> 50:53.360
Shit.

50:53.360 --> 50:53.760
Thank you.

50:54.400 --> 50:55.440
That could be you.

50:55.440 --> 50:58.320
I mean, that's the thing you got to remember is you're going to have to be the one who's

50:58.320 --> 51:03.200
like basically causing people, I can testify, the worst day of their lives.

51:03.200 --> 51:03.920
Right.

51:03.920 --> 51:04.640
A hundred percent.

51:05.520 --> 51:07.200
And you're going to be the one doing it.

51:07.200 --> 51:10.400
Probably every couple of minutes, I would imagine.

51:10.400 --> 51:13.360
But you got to be careful if you're going to do both jobs, though, because if you show

51:13.360 --> 51:18.400
up to the sushi job and you're in your candy job uniform, they're going to know that you

51:18.400 --> 51:26.480
are cheating on them or or or you say, well, here's my idea, you guys.

51:26.480 --> 51:27.200
Candy sushi.

51:27.200 --> 51:28.080
Oh, my God.

51:28.080 --> 51:28.640
What's the right?

51:28.640 --> 51:30.800
Like, obviously the top can be like sour tape.

51:30.800 --> 51:32.000
But what's what's the rice?

51:32.880 --> 51:36.880
I'm thinking the rice is maybe like a rice crispy treat.

51:36.880 --> 51:41.440
Like I was going to say rice crispy or like a jelly belly, like buttered popcorn.

51:41.440 --> 51:42.160
That's little though.

51:42.160 --> 51:43.920
That's that's all kind of mush.

51:43.920 --> 51:44.800
But you get a bunch of them.

51:44.800 --> 51:46.080
You mush them together.

51:46.080 --> 51:50.800
My my wife will sometimes have chocolate and fruit candies in the same bag.

51:51.360 --> 51:52.000
What?

51:52.000 --> 51:52.720
What?

51:52.720 --> 51:54.000
Well, she's a monster.

51:54.000 --> 51:54.720
Can you imagine?

51:55.280 --> 51:57.120
Can you even imagine?

51:57.120 --> 51:58.800
Thanks so much for listening to our podcast.

51:58.800 --> 51:59.680
My brother, my brother, me.

51:59.680 --> 52:01.680
It's an advice show for the modern era.

52:01.680 --> 52:05.280
Hey, if you're not listening to it already, we do another podcast with our daddy called

52:05.280 --> 52:06.080
the Adventure Zone.

52:06.080 --> 52:07.440
It's a D&D podcast.

52:07.440 --> 52:12.000
And you can go and you can find it on Maximumfun.org.

52:12.640 --> 52:14.960
You can find it on iTunes.

52:15.360 --> 52:18.320
We just released our, I guess, our 15th episode.

52:18.320 --> 52:19.040
16th.

52:19.040 --> 52:20.400
Yeah, we're from 16th.

52:20.400 --> 52:21.600
It's a story based show.

52:21.600 --> 52:23.200
So you want to start back at the beginning, I think.

52:23.200 --> 52:25.120
But Travis has made that even easier for you.

52:25.120 --> 52:26.160
Travis, can you explain how?

52:26.960 --> 52:32.240
So our first episode, it's great if you love D&D, if you've played before.

52:32.240 --> 52:36.400
And we talk a lot about how fifth edition is different from previous editions and how

52:36.400 --> 52:37.520
gameplay works.

52:37.520 --> 52:41.120
But we heard from a couple of people that, like, they just wanted to get into the story

52:41.120 --> 52:42.960
and they weren't really interested in gameplay.

52:42.960 --> 52:48.880
So we re-edited the first episode and edited it from two hours down to 52 minutes.

52:48.880 --> 52:52.160
So it's just the storyline, the funny parts and the character development.

52:52.720 --> 52:56.560
So if you've got a friend that you know would love the show, but maybe you think would

52:56.560 --> 53:01.600
be turned off by all the gameplay stuff, then play episode 1.5 for them.

53:01.600 --> 53:04.880
Or maybe it's you and you're like, oh, man, I really want to get into it.

53:04.880 --> 53:10.000
But, like, they started talking about, like, how saving throws work and I just don't care.

53:10.000 --> 53:10.560
Great.

53:10.560 --> 53:12.080
Listen to episode 1.5.

53:12.080 --> 53:13.600
That's going to be your end.

53:13.600 --> 53:17.680
There are other podcasts, too, on Maximum Fun that we do and don't do.

53:17.680 --> 53:21.120
Justin does a show with his wife, Sydney, called Saw Bones, and it's a medical history

53:21.120 --> 53:21.760
show.

53:21.760 --> 53:24.560
And Travis does a show with his buddy, Andy, called Bunker Buddies.

53:25.360 --> 53:28.640
And Travis has another show that's not on Maximum Fun that he just launched with his

53:28.640 --> 53:30.240
buddy, Brent, called Trends Like These.

53:31.200 --> 53:34.400
And then there's other shows on Maximum Fun that we're not a part of, like Judge John

53:34.400 --> 53:40.400
Hodgman, and Stop Podcasting Yourself, and Lady 2 Lady, and One Bad Mother, Throwing Shade,

53:40.400 --> 53:40.960
and The Flophouse.

53:40.960 --> 53:41.920
They're all really, really great.

53:41.920 --> 53:44.160
So go to MaximumFun.org and you can find all those shows.

53:44.160 --> 53:44.640
They're terrific.

53:44.640 --> 53:45.680
Go listen to them.

53:45.680 --> 53:46.160
Awesome.

53:46.160 --> 53:49.440
We've got a Pacific Northwest tour coming up at the end of August.

53:50.160 --> 53:52.560
Tickets are still on sale for Seattle and Vancouver.

53:52.560 --> 54:01.360
If you go to bit.ly forward slash mbmbamseattle and bit.ly forward slash vanmbmbam, you can

54:01.360 --> 54:02.320
find those tickets there.

54:02.320 --> 54:04.880
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song, It's

54:04.880 --> 54:06.720
a Departure, off the album, But In the Days to Bed.

54:06.720 --> 54:10.800
Do you guys realize that like this time next week, we'll be saying that in front of John

54:10.800 --> 54:11.360
Roderick?

54:12.560 --> 54:16.240
Yeah, or like sitting on his lap, giving him gentle kisses on his cheek.

54:16.240 --> 54:18.800
Well, probably not that one.

54:18.800 --> 54:19.680
Thank you, John Roderick.

54:19.680 --> 54:20.480
Thank you, Daddy.

54:20.480 --> 54:21.360
Thank you, Daddy Roderick.

54:24.080 --> 54:30.160
I also want to plug Justin's hit web series, Things I Bought at Sheets, which you can find

54:30.160 --> 54:37.440
at sheetsshow.com, it's Sheets, S-H-E-E-T-Z show.com, that he does with his buddy Dwight.

54:37.440 --> 54:39.440
It's like the best video series.

54:39.440 --> 54:42.960
It comes out just about every day, and I cannot wait for every episode.

54:42.960 --> 54:43.440
It's a roller coaster.

54:43.440 --> 54:44.240
Every episode is a treat.

54:44.240 --> 54:45.920
I really like it, Travis, I've been meaning to ask you if you really like it.

54:45.920 --> 54:47.120
I do, I really love it.

54:47.120 --> 54:48.720
Teresa and I watch it every morning.

54:48.720 --> 54:53.360
Justin and I also play video games for Polygon in a series that we launched recently called

54:53.360 --> 54:55.680
Monster Factory, that I'm very, very proud of.

54:55.680 --> 54:59.360
I watched all the Monster Factory videos.

54:59.360 --> 55:00.240
They're good, they're like 30.

55:00.240 --> 55:01.040
What did you think of them?

55:01.760 --> 55:03.360
I enjoyed them deeply.

55:03.360 --> 55:06.720
Squirtle was one of my favorites, but the Fallout one-

55:06.720 --> 55:07.840
The Fallout one turned out pretty good.

55:07.840 --> 55:08.960
You guys outdid yourselves.

55:08.960 --> 55:11.840
Man, we got our fingers in a lot of pies, huh, boys?

55:11.840 --> 55:12.400
We do have-

55:12.400 --> 55:13.040
A lot of pies.

55:13.040 --> 55:14.000
Oh, we're sorry about that.

55:14.000 --> 55:17.360
I feel guilty about my Twitter feed right now, because it's just like, I made something

55:17.360 --> 55:19.520
else, look at it, Dad.

55:19.520 --> 55:21.200
Well, you should also check out-

55:21.200 --> 55:23.200
John Roderick, look at my goof-em-ups.

55:23.200 --> 55:24.240
Are you proud of me now?

55:24.240 --> 55:25.920
John Roderick, you proud of me?

55:25.920 --> 55:29.200
I made a Fallout goof-em-up, Daddy Roderick.

55:30.240 --> 55:36.240
Daddy's actually over here watching the puddle for me, and I literally said to him out loud,

55:36.240 --> 55:39.680
hey, Daddy, you want to watch my Things About It Sheets videos I made this week?

55:41.840 --> 55:42.720
Oh, man.

55:42.720 --> 55:44.560
You want to pat my head while you tell me how good that is?

55:44.560 --> 55:45.280
Did I do a good job?

55:45.280 --> 55:48.960
I know I just tweeted this out to tens of thousands of people, but I need your approval,

55:48.960 --> 55:49.680
desperately.

55:51.440 --> 55:52.560
Please, Daddy.

55:52.560 --> 55:54.400
Do you guys want a Final Yahoo?

55:54.400 --> 55:55.440
Yes, please.

55:55.440 --> 55:57.680
Final Yahoo was sent in by Rachel Sperling.

55:57.680 --> 55:58.320
Thank you, Rachel.

55:58.320 --> 56:06.480
It's by Yahoo Answers user Kamal, who asks, what medicine is for longtime sex?

56:09.200 --> 56:10.240
I'm Justin McElroy.

56:10.240 --> 56:11.200
I'm Travis McElroy.

56:13.440 --> 56:14.240
Kiss your dads.

56:47.120 --> 56:48.160
Did you guys like that?

56:48.880 --> 56:50.960
Did you, the listener, like that?

56:50.960 --> 56:55.120
You were just swept up in a world of high fantasy and magic where anything can happen

56:55.120 --> 56:56.480
and anything is possible.

56:56.480 --> 57:00.880
Hi, I'm Griffin McElroy, dungeon master for The Adventure Zone, a new podcast on Maximum

experience.

You can catch it every other Thursday here on Maximumfun.org or iTunes.
