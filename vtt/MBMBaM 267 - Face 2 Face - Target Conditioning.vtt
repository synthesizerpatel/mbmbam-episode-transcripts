00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

00:14.000 --> 00:23.000
What's up, you cool babies?

00:45.000 --> 00:54.000
Familiar, but not too familiar, but not too not familiar.

00:54.000 --> 01:15.000
It's a new craze, hey good girls, do you want it? Just say, hey I wanna. Just say, hey I wanna.

01:25.000 --> 01:32.000
John Rodger, John Rodger, John Rodger.

01:32.000 --> 01:36.000
Oh shit.

01:36.000 --> 01:42.000
I'm going to be, I'm going to be, I'm going to be worthless this whole show after that.

01:42.000 --> 01:49.000
John Rodger, one more time for John Rodger.

01:49.000 --> 01:54.000
He was like, do you want me to play the whole song? And we're like, let's remember who's on the marquee.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
Hey, hey.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
Calm down.

01:56.000 --> 02:04.000
Seattle, are you ready for a psychosexual journey with us?

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
My name.

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
We're all going to come through the other end together.

02:08.000 --> 02:25.000
Yeah, we, yeah, this is my brother, my brother and me, it's an advice show for the modern era and I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy.

02:25.000 --> 02:31.000
I'm your middle is brother Travis McElroy.

02:31.000 --> 02:40.000
And I'm your sweet baby brother Flop Sweat Magoo.

02:40.000 --> 02:48.000
I apologize for my shininess, but you see, I'm fucking terrified.

02:48.000 --> 02:53.000
This is great though because the lighting allows me to only see the first 10 people, which feels right.

02:53.000 --> 03:01.000
Yeah, it feels like an intimate coffee shop show. Super attractive, super duper attractive.

03:01.000 --> 03:06.000
Hey baby, I hear the blues are calling, toss salad and scrambled eggs.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
Now wait, now hold on.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
We had a fucking screaming argument about that.

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
I mainly did that to irritate Griffin.

03:14.000 --> 03:26.000
Hold on, I want to jump in. Griffin's big argument against us referencing Frasier was, no, hold on, his problem was, oh, everyone does that.

03:26.000 --> 03:35.000
And he was just now, he was afraid that he literally said every comic act that comes to the net.

03:35.000 --> 03:39.000
I'm saying fucking U2 comes here and plays at Bugaboo.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
What's the, what's the thing that they do?

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
Bugaboo?

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
What's the thing that they do at the Bumber shoot?

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
Is that here?

03:46.000 --> 03:49.000
You two plays at Bumber shoot and they're like, all right, here we go.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
Uno, dos, tres, catorce.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
Hey baby, I hear the blues.

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
Get it you fucks.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
That was you guys.

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
You guys were Frasier.

03:59.000 --> 04:07.000
This is a true story I heard that the dog from Frasier was notorious for killing cats at the studio.

04:07.000 --> 04:13.000
There was a wrangler who had to stop him from killing cats on studio grounds.

04:13.000 --> 04:17.000
I like to think if a dog reaches a certain level of celebrity, they can fucking kill as many cats as they want.

04:17.000 --> 04:22.000
Better question, why were there so many cats at that studio?

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
Seemed like he was doing a service.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
That dog had Alf's rider.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
Just like, I only need six cats.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
What did you put?

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
Nice.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
Nice.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
So this is an advice show.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
Are there any people?

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
I'm just going to try to see.

04:35.000 --> 04:39.000
Are there any people, please raise your hands if they haven't listened to My Brother, My Brother and Me before?

04:39.000 --> 04:43.000
And we'll try to hear the sounds of your fucking hands going up because we definitely can't see you.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
Yeah, I can see you.

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
I heard some armpits deploy.

04:48.000 --> 04:54.000
This is, if you are familiar with Dear Abby, it's basically like that.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
It's an advice show and that's.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
With an irreverent twist.

04:58.000 --> 05:04.000
With an irreverent, we bring our own twisted view, our own skewed perspective to every, anyway.

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
I have green eyes and stranger always compliment them.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
They'll say something like, your eyes are so pretty.

05:10.000 --> 05:14.000
And then they'll say, you must get that a lot.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
I never know how to respond.

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
Just saying, thank you or I do get that a lot.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
Sounds conceited.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
How do I respond to these compliments?

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
Do I compliment them back?

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
And that's from Gmail.

05:24.000 --> 05:31.000
Justin, I want to say first that I really enjoyed your wistful reading of, you have such nice eyes.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
Like the rest of the sentence is, my eyes are so bad.

05:34.000 --> 05:40.000
Would it kill you to shoot some of that our way from time to time?

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
We've known each other for a while now.

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
You haven't said word one about these peepers.

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
Wait, look at me grooving?

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
Dreamy.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
Thank you.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
Justin?

05:52.000 --> 05:56.000
They're fine.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
I'll just be here.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
They're functional.

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
Oh, sorry.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
Super good.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
Thank you.

06:04.000 --> 06:08.000
Are you here, green eyes person?

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
That's a lie.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
That's a lie, isn't it?

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
That took way too long.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
Was that a pity woo?

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
I don't want them to be awkward.

06:15.000 --> 06:19.000
Somebody out there has green eyes and they're like, this is my moment.

06:19.000 --> 06:23.000
Did I get super drunk and right into an advice podcast?

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
Was that me?

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
Was that me?

06:25.000 --> 06:30.000
Can I just say, I personally love the move of going, thanks, I get that a lot.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
That's a power move.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
You have great eyes.

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
I know.

06:35.000 --> 06:39.000
So do you at seeing my great eyes.

06:39.000 --> 06:44.000
How observant of you to notice those must be fully functional peepers you got because

06:44.000 --> 06:49.000
they have definitely observed the masterpiece that I have going on here between brow and

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
nose.

06:51.000 --> 06:56.000
There's got to be like just a reusable phrase you can use for like, well, thanks.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
I've been growing them.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
No, here's the joke.

07:00.000 --> 07:04.000
This is the joke that I use when I get any compliment, like nice hair, which I get a

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
lot.

07:05.000 --> 07:09.000
This fucking whoa, we're not deep enough into this show.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
Sexy.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
Wow.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
This is the response.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
Thanks.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
I've been working out, but you have to say it like this.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
I didn't say it right.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
Hold on.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
Let me do the delivery better.

07:19.000 --> 07:24.000
Hold on.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
But like more natural than that.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
You put a little Mike Myers stink face on it.

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
I know it's funny too.

07:31.000 --> 07:35.000
And then by that time, hopefully the elevators opened and you can escape.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
Yeah, sure.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
Holy shit.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
Quick sidebar.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
Can we talk about that number one dude we met in the elevator last night?

07:41.000 --> 07:47.000
We were on the first floor of our hotel last night in Portland and we're first floor and

07:47.000 --> 07:52.000
we were going up some Portland people that came up to this show.

07:52.000 --> 07:56.000
That's like 70% of the fucking audience.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
No one actually lives in Seattle.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
They just like apparently truck in.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
I commute for my comedy podcast.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
We're on the first floor.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
We had just gotten back from the show last night.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
Super late.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
We were all super tired.

08:06.000 --> 08:12.000
The door opens up and we're going to the sixth floor and there's a dude just in it.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
And we were like, hey, he's like, this is going down.

08:14.000 --> 08:19.000
It was like, I assure you we're on the bottom of this building.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
There's no more building.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
So then the door closes.

08:21.000 --> 08:25.000
The door closes because we're all very like passive people.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
And then opens again.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
It opens again.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
He's like, oh, I guess it's going up now.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
Like, yeah, we fucking hacked it.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
Up, up, down, down, up, down, up.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
And then you can change the direction of the elevator.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
He did not say, I guess it's going up now.

08:37.000 --> 08:41.000
He said it's going up now as if we ruined it.

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
Like he was trying to play it off as, oh, no, no.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
I did go downstairs.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
Made no mistake.

08:46.000 --> 08:50.000
I took care of what I needed to take care of.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
I did that downstairs and now I'm going up.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
You lost track of time.

08:54.000 --> 08:58.000
And then he got off the elevator.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
Where were you going?

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
What was in the basement for you, sir?

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
I've got a boiler I'm excited about.

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
There was a woman when Teresa and I got there and we got on the elevator to go to her room.

09:06.000 --> 09:10.000
We got there in our bags and this woman, apropos like we press the button, it's silent.

09:10.000 --> 09:15.000
She just turns to us and goes, consider this your Portland welcome.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
And then turn back.

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
And then we got off the elevator and said, thanks.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
I feel so welcome now.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
Do you remember what the dude's shirt said?

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
Because that was the best part.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
Oh, yes.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
Oh, it was professional sports?

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
It was professional championship.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
Professional championship.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
Two words.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
She's like, cool.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
Okay, wait.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
Imagine in your mind a man in a shirt.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
Do you have it?

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
We'll give you a moment.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
Do you have it?

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
Imagine his shirt has two words on it.

09:40.000 --> 09:45.000
They are in this order, professional championship.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
Okay?

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
That's someone who's hedging their bets.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
It's so kind of something.

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
Because sports or business are both sports business.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
I think we answered the question.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
Calculate off.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
I think we helped as best we could.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
Yeah.

09:57.000 --> 10:01.000
Does anybody here want a Yahoo answer?

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
Good.

10:03.000 --> 10:07.000
If you're new to the show, sometimes people, I was going to say we'll get Yahoo answers

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
to the show, but that's just not true.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
People get them for us.

10:11.000 --> 10:16.000
Like Rachel Sperling, game recognized game.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
Rachel Sperling, are you here?

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
Yeah, it would be concerning if you weren't.

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
Because you told us you were going to be, yeah.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
Recognize the game.

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
This is Rachel's like seventh live show with us.

10:27.000 --> 10:31.000
And she just knows to stand up and wave because we'll make her do it if she does.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
Recognize that game.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
Griffin, what's the Yahoo?

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
Just got a nice text from my wife.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
What's it say?

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
No, don't worry about it.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
Travis Stone, it's private.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
Rachel Sperling sent this in.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
Thank you.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
There's a thousand people here.

10:42.000 --> 10:51.000
It's by Yahoo answers user, Happy Equine, who asks.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
Yeah.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
Yeah, we're doing that.

10:53.000 --> 10:57.000
This is one of them.

10:57.000 --> 11:05.000
Happy Equine asks, desensitization, balloons?

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
Go ahead.

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000
Desensitization, balloons?

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
So, this is longer than our usual fare.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
Buckle up.

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
So I wanted to start desensitizing my horse.

11:16.000 --> 11:21.000
I brought out a bag of potentially scary things to see what we would need to work on throughout the next few weeks.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
There was a shiny banner that he was great with.

11:23.000 --> 11:28.000
I could cover his eyes and wrap it around him, toss it, run around with it so it flapped, etc.

11:28.000 --> 11:31.000
Then I moved on to a large plastic flag.

11:31.000 --> 11:40.000
He was pretty nervous, but after about 15 minutes, I was able to rub it on him, put it on his face, etc.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
You need some more, Dennis.

11:41.000 --> 11:45.000
By the end of the day, I was even riding with it, WTC.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
What does that mean?

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on.

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
One person.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
Walk, chalk, cancer.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
Holy fucking shit.

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
We got a couple of horse heads in the audience.

11:57.000 --> 12:02.000
Well, they're probably not called horse heads.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
Okay, wait.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
Hang on after the show because I've got a lot of questions.

12:05.000 --> 12:08.000
I've been talking a lot of horse bullshit for a while.

12:08.000 --> 12:18.000
I need to know, is that so common a thing that you had to shorten it to save what?

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
That's, yeah.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
You've got a lot.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
Listen, you're a horse trainer.

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
WTC saves one syllable.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
Yeah.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
Okay.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
We'll talk after the show.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
Okay, listen.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
We'll exchange business cards.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
Yeah.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
Mine says my brother, my brother, and me.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
Right.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
Okay, listen.

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
We know jack shit about horses, but we talk about them.

12:36.000 --> 12:41.000
If you're a horse trainer, and I cannot imagine there are so many different levels that walk,

12:41.000 --> 12:44.000
chalk, canter is just like, that's just step one.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
That's like 5% of it.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
What else is this horse doing?

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
I know horses.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
They just don't bite you, and then they walk, chalk, canter.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
That's it, right?

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
That's like the whole thing.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
I almost said triage, but I know that's not it.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
Dressage?

12:56.000 --> 12:57.000
What the fuck?

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
There it is.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
Okay, all right.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
I knew it wasn't triage.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
I want that on the record.

13:03.000 --> 13:08.000
Horses are good at knowing who would die first in a horrible accident.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
Will he survive?

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
Nay.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
Nay.

13:11.000 --> 13:20.000
Please finish the question.

13:20.000 --> 13:24.000
Okay, this woman rubbed a fucking flag on a horse for a while.

13:24.000 --> 13:28.000
A lot of this question is about rubbing flags on horses.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
Then came the scary thing, balloons.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
I was slowly introducing it to him.

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
My horse spooks mostly at sounds, so I was practicing with noises.

13:35.000 --> 13:39.000
I would simply let out the air, and he went crazy.

13:39.000 --> 13:42.000
After no improvement, which he had quickly had with the other objects,

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
I tried different sounds with the balloon.

13:44.000 --> 13:48.000
Everyone made him so scared, just very scared, so I stopped,

13:48.000 --> 13:51.000
not wanting to scare the bad gibbies out of him.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
Sorry, I fucked that up.

13:53.000 --> 13:57.000
Without wanting to scare the bad gibbies out of my poor boy.

13:57.000 --> 14:01.000
Anyways, how can I get him used to these noises without terrifying him?

14:01.000 --> 14:04.000
I will only do a little bit at a time so I don't overwhelm him,

14:04.000 --> 14:07.000
but what are some of your ideas?

14:07.000 --> 14:10.000
It does not sound like that is the case at all.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
Yeah, it sounds like you put this horse through a gauntlet,

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
a day-long gauntlet of error.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
You're a fucking Marquis de Sade of order.

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
What about these?

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
He's French.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
Yeah, sure.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
Most Marquis are.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
I'd wager, maybe.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
I don't know.

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
Anything.

14:27.000 --> 14:30.000
How important is it that when you're training a horse,

14:30.000 --> 14:34.000
how important is it that it be completely without fear?

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
Is that the ideal?

14:36.000 --> 14:39.000
If you're on it, probably pretty important.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
Super important.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.000
That's what they're teaching.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
They're not working on anything other than,

14:43.000 --> 14:46.000
I want this horse to be the horse without fear.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
No, I like this idea, though.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
Like you got a horse.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
That's good.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
Pretty good.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
You should keep doing that one for the rest of the day.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.000
Nice.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
Nice.

14:57.000 --> 15:00.000
That was a peach of a joke.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
In tandem.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
Here's the thing.

15:03.000 --> 15:09.000
I guess what's most confusing to me is this idea of a fixer-upper horse.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
If you get the horse and it's not immediately good

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
at whatever you need it to be good at,

15:13.000 --> 15:16.000
and you're like, but I'll desensitize it.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
How about you just don't make that horse do that thing?

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
Like it's not good around balloons.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
That's how the horses cross the bear.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
Yeah.

15:23.000 --> 15:27.000
When God made horses, he was like, these things are perfect.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
I got to do at least one.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.000
Hey, hey, come in here.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
Check out this horse.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
Check out this awesome thing I made.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
Nailed it, right?

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
Yeah, it's pretty good, right?

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
All sinewy and perfect and perfect.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
Super good.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
This is my day.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
This is really good.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
I should make it like super afraid of one thing.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
How about balloons?

15:42.000 --> 15:45.000
They won't have to deal with it for, I don't know, like 3,000 years.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
How long have horses been around?

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
200 years.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
Trainers?

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
Oh, got you there.

15:52.000 --> 15:55.000
Where are horses and balloons even interacting?

15:55.000 --> 15:58.000
They're not allowed at Times Square during the ball drop.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
Where they drop balloons?

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
Never mind.

16:00.000 --> 16:04.000
Maybe like a cart that delivers balloons to someplace.

16:04.000 --> 16:07.000
You show up to like a Flaming Lips concert with a horse,

16:07.000 --> 16:10.000
they're like, nope, turn around.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
Others are very upset.

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
No one was more excited about the invention of the automobile

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
than balloon salesmen.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
Finally, a calm drive.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
Finally, a way to get these from A to B

16:22.000 --> 16:25.000
without it being a whole thing.

16:25.000 --> 16:29.000
So many balloon salesmen died from going over cliffs

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
in runaway carts.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
Slow down, Brutus.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
I am actively labeled as the hipster

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
in any of the various friend groups that I have.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
My friends expect me to only appreciate bands

16:39.000 --> 16:40.000
that they've never heard of.

16:40.000 --> 16:44.000
While yes, I do have some obscure tastes.

16:44.000 --> 16:51.000
I also have a pretty profound love for some modern pop artists.

16:51.000 --> 16:58.000
When my friends or acquaintances hear me getting down

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
with the latest club banger,

17:00.000 --> 17:03.000
they assume I'm listening to it ironically and mock me for it.

17:03.000 --> 17:06.000
How do I convince my friends to stop throwing shade?

17:06.000 --> 17:10.000
That's from subpar Seattle hipster, are you there?

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
Hey, word up.

17:12.000 --> 17:16.000
I was hoping you'd be like, eh.

17:16.000 --> 17:19.000
Can I give you some advice?

17:19.000 --> 17:22.000
That's why you're here.

17:22.000 --> 17:25.000
Stop using phrases.

17:25.000 --> 17:28.000
Like modern pop artists?

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
Don't say that.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
If you call it the latest club banger,

17:32.000 --> 17:35.000
you are indeed listening to it ironically.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
I don't know how to break it to you.

17:37.000 --> 17:40.000
Here's a list of people who can use the term club banger

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
unironically.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.000
Pitbull.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.000
Holy shit!

17:44.000 --> 17:50.000
Whoa!

17:50.000 --> 17:54.000
Well, that's going to do it.

17:54.000 --> 17:57.000
Travis, if you'd done that shit too, we could retire.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
I'll do it now, we'll edit it in.

17:59.000 --> 18:02.000
Pitbull.

18:02.000 --> 18:05.000
The joke was that there wasn't another name after Pitbull.

18:05.000 --> 18:08.000
That's it.

18:08.000 --> 18:12.000
Even if Chingy was like, club banger, you're like, Chingy.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.000
Chingy?

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
Stop it.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
This is one of those problems where someone says,

18:16.000 --> 18:19.000
hey, everyone thinks this about me, but they're wrong.

18:19.000 --> 18:22.000
The problem, sorry to call you out,

18:22.000 --> 18:27.000
but you're putting out something that makes everyone think that.

18:27.000 --> 18:31.000
Maybe they know something, you don't.

18:31.000 --> 18:35.000
Maybe you are listening to it ironically, so ironically,

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
even you don't know.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
The deepest level of irony.

18:38.000 --> 18:41.000
Yeah, you've crossed the Rubicon of irony.

18:41.000 --> 18:44.000
Time to look in that deep, dark, truthful mirror and say,

18:44.000 --> 18:47.000
do I really enjoy the new Carly Rae Jepsen album, Emotion?

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
Yeah, let's talk about Carly Rae Jepsen.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
Indeed I do.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
No, let's not.

18:51.000 --> 18:55.000
I have heard that album straight through six times today.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
We measured our J.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
I asked Griffin, who was driving the whole way,

18:59.000 --> 19:03.000
how far we were away when we were driving to Seattle today,

19:03.000 --> 19:07.000
and he said, we're about one and a half Carly Rae Jepsen's emotions away,

19:07.000 --> 19:12.000
because that's all we listened to the entire drive.

19:12.000 --> 19:16.000
Our booking agent was backstage like, is that album really good,

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
or it's like people feel that way about me.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
No, it was real good.

19:19.000 --> 19:22.000
Making the most of the night, that was a good tune.

19:22.000 --> 19:26.000
Run Away With Me is another really good Carly Rae Jepsen song.

19:26.000 --> 19:29.000
Name one more really good Carly Rae Jepsen song.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
Fucking Emotion, Favorite Color.

19:31.000 --> 19:34.000
Yes, a bunch of favorite color fans out there.

19:34.000 --> 19:37.000
I'm getting really sweaty again.

19:37.000 --> 19:38.000
Yeah.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
Do you guys want to Yahoo?

19:40.000 --> 19:44.000
I feel like we didn't answer that question at all.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
We didn't answer that question really.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
Oh, man, but it's this question.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
I'm very excited about it.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
Okay.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
Send in by Level9000.

19:50.000 --> 19:57.000
Yeah, Drew Drew at Drew Davenport.

19:57.000 --> 20:00.000
I'm so excited.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
I read this one like a while ago.

20:01.000 --> 20:05.000
I was like, no, we're saving this one for Seattle because they've earned it.

20:05.000 --> 20:08.000
Because if anyone's going to get it, it's you freaks.

20:08.000 --> 20:11.000
Seattle audiences are the best audiences in the world.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
I've always heard that, Justin.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
I've always heard that.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
You know who told me that?

20:14.000 --> 20:17.000
John Roderick.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
Nobody rocks like Seattle.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
Griffin, do you have a fucking question?

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
Please, we can't stall any longer.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
Why were you on, please?

20:24.000 --> 20:28.000
I've been a Yahoo diver for so long now that I know how the system works.

20:28.000 --> 20:32.000
This person's name who asked this is anonymous, which means they're not anonymous.

20:32.000 --> 20:35.000
They put anonymous into the name field.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
It is anonymous, the group.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
This is by the hacktivist group anonymous.

20:39.000 --> 20:44.000
The hacktivist, the black hat hacktivist group anonymous asks,

20:44.000 --> 20:51.000
if butterflies could speak for 24 hours, what do you think we could learn in those 24 hours?

20:51.000 --> 21:00.000
We must know.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
It's the only way.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
Snowden leaning over his computer.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
Ah, shit.

21:05.000 --> 21:06.000
What if butterflies...

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
Oh, no.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
Oh, no.

21:08.000 --> 21:16.000
What have I done?

21:16.000 --> 21:19.000
I've been flying all day.

21:19.000 --> 21:22.000
That's Amelie.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
More or less.

21:23.000 --> 21:27.000
Wait, no, I haven't said any fucking asses.

21:27.000 --> 21:31.000
I've been visiting blossoms.

21:31.000 --> 21:34.000
You know what I found inside your blossoms?

21:34.000 --> 21:37.000
Secrets.

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
So Justin doesn't really...

21:39.000 --> 21:44.000
I put the blossoms outside your house, Mr. President.

21:44.000 --> 21:47.000
I've been out there with anonymous.

21:47.000 --> 21:50.000
Fucking Snowden is Amelie.

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
Yeah, dude.

21:51.000 --> 21:54.000
I just realized that.

21:54.000 --> 21:57.000
I made Snowden small and shrunk him down the size of a butterfly.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.000
He was Amelie.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.000
He became Amelie, yeah.

21:59.000 --> 22:00.000
That'd be a great movie.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.000
You know...

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
Whoa.

22:02.000 --> 22:08.000
Anyway, if butterflies could talk for 24 hours, what could we learn in those 24 hours?

22:08.000 --> 22:16.000
Probably a lot of like B racial slurs.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
Like ones we don't even know.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
Like cool ones we're not even aware of.

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
All those honey butts.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
Honey butts?

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
I didn't say they were nice or clever.

22:25.000 --> 22:32.000
Can I just say that typically I don't use them, but racial slurs, typically not adorable.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
This is from butterflies.

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
That's true.

22:35.000 --> 22:36.000
Pollen suckers.

22:36.000 --> 22:37.000
Is that good?

22:37.000 --> 22:38.000
That's pretty good.

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
Well, butterflies pollinate, too, so that'd be...

22:40.000 --> 22:41.000
Well, okay.

22:41.000 --> 22:44.000
No one asked your opinion, fucking Bear Grylls.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
Keep it to yourself.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
Keep it to yourself, Jack Hanna.

22:48.000 --> 22:52.000
Maybe butterflies should talk about how great it is to pollinate plants.

22:52.000 --> 22:53.000
Oh, God.

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
I was all up in that daisy.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
That daisy over there.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
I got deep in her stamen.

22:58.000 --> 23:01.000
Crush that stamen, that pistol.

23:01.000 --> 23:04.000
Daisy's juicy.

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
God.

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
That's gross.

23:06.000 --> 23:09.000
Those are bad two words.

23:09.000 --> 23:12.000
I always like the assumption that if animals could talk, what would they say?

23:12.000 --> 23:18.000
This idea of, like, they've got so much wisdom that I think most butterflies would just be going...

23:18.000 --> 23:23.000
It's insane to think...

23:23.000 --> 23:29.000
Okay, it's so human-centric to think that butterflies, could they talk?

23:29.000 --> 23:32.000
Could really add anything to the human experience.

23:32.000 --> 23:36.000
Like, they've probably got a lot of knowledge that's very specific to butterflies.

23:36.000 --> 23:37.000
Oh, what's it all about?

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
Oh, man, I've been waiting to tell you.

23:39.000 --> 23:46.000
Yeah, like, it's basically about I was a worm for a while, and then I squinched around,

23:46.000 --> 23:50.000
and then my butt felt weird, and then I was in a coffin, and I was this.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
I was like some soup in a coffin, I guess.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
Yeah, some soup in a coffin, I don't know.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
And I can't wait to see what's next.

23:56.000 --> 23:57.000
What do I transform into next?

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
I don't know.

23:59.000 --> 24:00.000
What's next for me?

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
I see big furry things walking around.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
Really excited to try that out.

24:04.000 --> 24:07.000
You big pink fucks, I would love to take a stab at one of you.

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
Whatever you tall people with glasses are.

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
That would be dope.

24:11.000 --> 24:14.000
What if they only spoke Portuguese?

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
I have nothing for you, butterfly.

24:16.000 --> 24:19.000
I do not speak Portuguese.

24:19.000 --> 24:25.000
But it's that way, you got one day to get there, maybe catch a plane.

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
You can probably sneak onto a plane.

24:26.000 --> 24:27.000
I'll take you in my bag.

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
Come with me.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
I'll take it in my bag.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
I'll fly to Portugal.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
Be free.

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
Talk to you.

24:34.000 --> 24:37.000
I bet butterflies.

24:37.000 --> 24:38.000
I bet butterflies.

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
Now hold on.

24:39.000 --> 24:46.000
I want to live in the world in which a butterfly is just stable in the air in Griffin's carry-on

24:46.000 --> 24:47.000
for the entire flight.

24:47.000 --> 24:52.000
Just going, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.

24:52.000 --> 24:53.000
Over there.

24:53.000 --> 24:54.000
Portugal.

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
My home.

24:56.000 --> 25:02.000
While I was in your backpack, I caught some Pokemon for you.

25:02.000 --> 25:07.000
Remind me to turn my street pass on when we go back up stage, because I bet, yeah, my

25:07.000 --> 25:11.000
fucking 3DS will just melt.

25:11.000 --> 25:15.000
I bet butterflies, after they've transformed, are just insufferable.

25:15.000 --> 25:16.000
Yeah.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
They just think their king should have fucked down, I bet.

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
Oh, yeah.

25:19.000 --> 25:23.000
You realize I was a piece of shit worm like a day ago.

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
Listen, baby.

25:24.000 --> 25:28.000
I remember what it was like just being a worm, scooting around without looking at me.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
I'm up here zooming around, soaring with the clouds.

25:30.000 --> 25:34.000
I've got stained glass wings and a proboscis.

25:34.000 --> 25:38.000
Why is Robert Evans a butterfly?

25:38.000 --> 25:43.000
I remember when my wings first unfurled, and I thought, are these wings small?

25:43.000 --> 25:46.000
But then I thought, it's how you flap them.

25:46.000 --> 25:50.000
I'll tell you who loves wings.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
Miss Judy Garland.

25:52.000 --> 25:53.000
She was such a big fan.

25:53.000 --> 25:58.000
She loved Two Things Booze and these beautiful flappers behind me.

25:58.000 --> 26:01.000
Kept looking for a project to do together, never could work it out.

26:01.000 --> 26:04.000
I only lived for 24 hours.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
Well, I think they lived for a long time.

26:06.000 --> 26:07.000
Super busy.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.000
Okay.

26:08.000 --> 26:15.000
Boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo.

26:15.000 --> 26:16.000
You did not prepare us for this.

26:16.000 --> 26:20.000
I just looked over at your computer and it was zoomed in and terrifying.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.000
Ladies and gentlemen, this just in.

26:21.000 --> 26:26.000
It's a haunted doll watch.

26:26.000 --> 26:27.000
Boo.

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
This is hot across the wire.

26:28.000 --> 26:29.000
This is coming in fast.

26:29.000 --> 26:32.000
I'm just trying to get these details together as I can.

26:32.000 --> 26:36.000
I just want you people in the audience to know and people at home, I will be spending

26:36.000 --> 26:40.000
the entire time Justin is talking, trying to figure out which celebrity this doll reminds

26:40.000 --> 26:41.000
me of.

26:41.000 --> 26:44.000
It's a powerful witch named Ava.

26:44.000 --> 26:48.000
It's a spirit vessel, EMV, EMP, very active, very powerful.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
EMV and EMP?

26:50.000 --> 26:51.000
Both of them, Griffin.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
Yes, I'm just trying to get the details together.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
We've got a description here.

26:55.000 --> 27:00.000
Welcome, for your consideration, is a beautiful porcelain doll.

27:00.000 --> 27:03.000
For the Academy Award for best spookiest doll goes to.

27:03.000 --> 27:04.000
Best spookiest.

27:04.000 --> 27:08.000
A spirit vessel and what an active spirit she is.

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
Ava is very independent.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
She does things her own way.

27:12.000 --> 27:15.000
Do not try to tie this haunted doll down.

27:15.000 --> 27:22.000
She calls herself a wild woman, a witch, untamable as the wind.

27:22.000 --> 27:30.000
This doll ghost, she inspires that aspect of our nature, reminding women to be strong.

27:30.000 --> 27:31.000
Whoa!

27:31.000 --> 27:32.000
To love ourselves.

27:32.000 --> 27:33.000
No, that's fucking no, no, no, no, no.

27:33.000 --> 27:34.000
That's fucking awesome.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.000
That's awesome, right?

27:35.000 --> 27:36.000
No, no, no.

27:36.000 --> 27:39.000
Picture a woman looking at a haunted doll and going, you know what, you're right.

27:39.000 --> 27:40.000
Yes.

27:40.000 --> 27:41.000
Yes.

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
I've been waiting for the, yes.

27:43.000 --> 27:44.000
You know how I write.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.000
You know what it is?

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
It's like, who's your inspirations woman?

27:47.000 --> 27:48.000
Sally Radegas?

27:48.000 --> 27:49.000
Who's yours?

27:49.000 --> 27:53.000
A doll that lives in my house.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
I did figure out who this doll looks like to me, by the way.

27:55.000 --> 27:56.000
Excellent.

27:56.000 --> 27:57.000
I bet on pins and fucking needles.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
It's Geena Davis in Beetlejuice.

27:59.000 --> 28:00.000
Yeah.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
Yeah, I could see that actually.

28:02.000 --> 28:03.000
For sure.

28:03.000 --> 28:06.000
Anyway, she inspires that aspect of our nature to love ourselves.

28:06.000 --> 28:11.000
She will not tolerate misogyny or bigotry.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
It's a fucking cool doll.

28:13.000 --> 28:18.000
She is a fierce protector, a healer, and she will bless your home with strength and protection.

28:18.000 --> 28:23.000
She says it's time for her to move on, to grace another home with her presence and her magic.

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
That's with a K.

28:25.000 --> 28:29.000
Who am I to argue?

28:29.000 --> 28:30.000
That's the best part.

28:30.000 --> 28:33.000
I'd love for you to kick it here for a while, but if you say so.

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
Steve, it's time for me to move on.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
I've got to go inspire some other lady.

28:37.000 --> 28:38.000
You know what, you're right.

28:38.000 --> 28:39.000
You're right.

28:39.000 --> 28:40.000
Yeah.

28:40.000 --> 28:41.000
Maybe she doesn't want to go.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
You have to punch her in the face like in Harriet and Henderson's.

28:43.000 --> 28:44.000
What?

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
You weren't down here.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
She is a fierce protector, a healer, who will bless your home.

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
Okay, who might argue, but I will miss her terribly.

28:50.000 --> 28:54.000
Are you the one she's looking for?

28:54.000 --> 28:57.000
Okay, I will miss her terribly.

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
There is a buy it now price at $59.99.

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
This is all I'm saying.

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
Listen, the new Call of Duty is coming out in a couple months.

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
I'm a little low on cash.

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
I've got to make my peace with the market forces.

29:07.000 --> 29:11.000
I would love to trade my feminist power totem.

29:11.000 --> 29:17.000
This doll is also shot literally like it looks like they held a flashlight under her chin.

29:17.000 --> 29:20.000
She's super great.

29:20.000 --> 29:25.000
And they take these pictures that have this like weird gold band across the front.

29:25.000 --> 29:26.000
Like maybe that's a spirit.

29:26.000 --> 29:27.000
I don't know.

29:27.000 --> 29:28.000
I don't know.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
I just think that's $60 real bad.

29:30.000 --> 29:36.000
I feel it is time to find new homes for some of the spirit vessels I've collected.

29:36.000 --> 29:39.000
This is the greatest short story I've ever heard in my life.

29:39.000 --> 29:43.000
I feel like I do not have enough time to devote to working with all of them.

29:43.000 --> 29:47.000
And it isn't fair to just keep them on the shelf.

29:47.000 --> 29:50.000
This, okay, this guy or girl.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
Yeah, you're just assuming.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
This person.

29:54.000 --> 29:58.000
Maybe it's a doll too.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
Inception 2.

30:00.000 --> 30:06.000
But their calling is to work with these vessels and they just got in over their head.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
I've just got too many.

30:08.000 --> 30:09.000
They don't have the time.

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
I need to cut Ava.

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
Sorry, Ava.

30:13.000 --> 30:18.000
Your first quarter performance is a little disappointing.

30:18.000 --> 30:22.000
Yeah, I don't know why she is stuck on JV and has to get sold on eBay.

30:22.000 --> 30:25.000
Feel free to ask any questions you have.

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
I can provide additional pictures if you would like.

30:27.000 --> 30:31.000
I will be listing other dolls soon if you would like to look at them as well.

30:31.000 --> 30:36.000
As per eBay guidelines, I must say that this is for entertainment purposes only.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.000
Oh, God.

30:37.000 --> 30:44.000
eBay, can you not fucking give us like a minute of fantasy from this shit ass world?

30:44.000 --> 30:45.000
You know what?

30:45.000 --> 30:48.000
Seriously though, fuck eBay.

30:48.000 --> 30:56.000
No, but seriously, fuck eBay because do you know what it says about their perception of you?

30:56.000 --> 31:02.000
That they're like, listen, you have to clarify that you're not selling a literal ghost.

31:02.000 --> 31:05.000
Like no fucking shit, eBay.

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
It's a ghost.

31:07.000 --> 31:20.000
That's a crazy assumption for you to make because implicit in eBay's requirement for you to say this is for entertainment purposes only is a tacit endorsement of the existence of ghosts by eBay.

31:20.000 --> 31:23.000
And not that your ability to buy and sell them.

31:23.000 --> 31:24.000
Not even that.

31:24.000 --> 31:28.000
That if ghosts do exist, they like to kick it in dolls.

31:28.000 --> 31:31.000
They'll go where the doll goes.

31:31.000 --> 31:32.000
Very easy.

31:32.000 --> 31:33.000
I'm a ghost, okay?

31:33.000 --> 31:34.000
When am I going to have it?

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
Wait, what?

31:36.000 --> 31:37.000
I'm a ghost.

31:37.000 --> 31:47.000
Am I going to have it like a stationary fake little human or like a bitch in Bugatti?

31:47.000 --> 31:48.000
Wait, hold on.

31:48.000 --> 31:52.000
We haven't checked haunted Bugatti watch.

31:52.000 --> 31:53.000
Yeah, it's so sad Griffin died.

31:53.000 --> 31:54.000
Yeah, it's pretty sad.

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
But he's inhabiting a Bugatti right now.

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
So he's actually pretty cool.

31:58.000 --> 31:59.000
He's worth more now.

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
He's on the Pacific Coast Highway.

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
You can't catch him.

32:03.000 --> 32:06.000
He's a very fast car now.

32:06.000 --> 32:07.000
I believe it's time for audience.

32:07.000 --> 32:11.000
That's what Tracy Chapman wrote that song about.

32:11.000 --> 32:19.000
The song Fast Car, she had a friend, became a ghost, became a Bugatti in like 1980.

32:19.000 --> 32:22.000
And we were driving, driving in my U.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
I was in you, driving.

32:24.000 --> 32:39.000
This is how fast car goes.

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
Good job, us in the past.

32:41.000 --> 32:42.000
Good job, past us.

32:42.000 --> 32:45.000
Boy, I wish present us were that good.

32:45.000 --> 32:50.000
Feel a little off my game, traveling a little road hard and put down wet.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
You know what'll help with that Griffin?

32:52.000 --> 32:53.000
What's that?

32:53.000 --> 32:57.000
It'll be Belgian waffles.

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
We should mention, Justin's not here.

32:59.000 --> 33:02.000
We just got back from the tour that you're listening to now.

33:02.000 --> 33:06.000
And it was a rough day of travel for most of us.

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
Yeah, a lot going on there.

33:08.000 --> 33:11.000
A lot of slip ups, a lot of goof em ups.

33:11.000 --> 33:14.000
We're home and in one piece, but that is why the episode is so late.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
We're very sorry.

33:16.000 --> 33:19.000
As long as we're busting out the bad news.

33:19.000 --> 33:27.000
If you were really looking forward to hearing the energy that we could bring to a room in Portland.

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
Then, shitty news.

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
Because you won't.

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
That audio did not turn out great.

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
Didn't turn out great.

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
Well, two thirds of it did.

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
Two thirds of it turned out super good.

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
Somehow Travis's audio didn't come through at all.

33:41.000 --> 33:45.000
Maybe we'll release that as like a really bad bonus episode.

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
Not for donors.

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
You deserve better than that.

33:49.000 --> 33:57.000
But it's just like, hey, if you want to consume every bit of garbage and errata that we can put out there.

33:57.000 --> 34:03.000
Then here, enjoy an episode where it sounds like Justin and I are talking to each other.

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
And also a ghost.

34:05.000 --> 34:09.000
Now Griffin, you know what will help if people are sad about not being able to hear the Portland show.

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
They should do what I do.

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
Eat mini Belgian waffles?

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
Eat your feelings away.

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
Then you want to go to naturebox.com.

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
Naturebox offers lots of snack choices.

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
Like the mini Belgian waffles that I mentioned earlier.

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
Strawberry lemonade fruit stars.

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
Sweet and salty nut medley.

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
The Asiago cheese crisps.

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
Which are in fact my favorite.

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
There's all kinds of stuff.

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
And it's full of flavor.

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
But you won't find any junk in that box.

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
No junk in that trunk.

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
You know what I mean?

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
No junk.

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
No podcast episodes where you can't hear one third of the hosts.

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
I thought I was over it.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
But apparently not entirely over it.

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
I had forgotten about it until you mentioned it.

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
Cool day.

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
If you would like to enjoy your first box of Naturebox snacks for free.

34:53.000 --> 34:57.000
You just have to go to naturebox.com slash my brother.

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
And you get to try a box of their favorite snacks.

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
And then you're going to fall in love with it.

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
And just start ordering it from them.

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
So go to naturebox.com slash my brother.

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
And make that happen.

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
And after you've fallen in love with Naturebox.

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
You're also going to fall asleep.

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
You're not going to wake up from having a big bear tummy full of food.

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
Time to hibernate.

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
And the best way to do that is on a mattress.

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
Yep.

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
That is historically the best way for humans to get sleep.

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
I've got a mattress recommendation for everyone.

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
And it's Casper.

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
Who just so happens is our sponsor this week.

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
I sleep on Casper.

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
It's amazing.

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
I got it in the mail.

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
It came in a relatively small box.

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
Then you open it up.

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
And like some kind of future tech.

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
It turned into a mattress.

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
It went from a weird rolled up plastic thing to a mattress.

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
It was amazing.

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
You put three drops of water on it.

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
You said a little wish.

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
A little prayer.

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
And then your energy.

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
It expanded it.

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
Anyway, I want to tell you about Casper.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
You go online. You buy it. They send it to you.

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
Like Travis said.

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
It's real little. And then it gets big.

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
And then it gets really comfy.

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
If you're unsold on this whole concept.

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
It's free delivery and painless returns.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
After 99 days you say, you know what?

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
No.

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
Casper was a ghost.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
And I find that a little too spooky to include in the bedroom.

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
I've got to get rid of it.

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
You can do that. You have 100 days to decide.

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
Right now you can get $50 towards any mattress purchase.

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
Because you listen to our show.

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
Just go to Casper.com slash my brother.

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
And use the promo code my brother.

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
All one word at checkout.

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
Terms and conditions do apply on that.

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
Not sure what that means.

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
But I do know as a hell of a mattress man.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
We also want to say a special message to Lucretia.

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
This is from Maurice.

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
Maurice says,

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
Happy birthday to my wonderful girlfriend Lucretia.

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
You are 100% the best thing that has happened to me.

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
I love you.

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
Also, having a name like Lucretia spawns a lot of nicknames.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
So, since she loves when you guys goof on a list.

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
Here are some of her nicknames.

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
Cretia.

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
Krish.

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
Lucky.

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
Lulu.

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
Lucretia.

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
And The Sugar.

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
I'm not sure why the list continued after Luda.

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
Or why there was anything that preceded Luda.

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
Because it's not even accurate, right?

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
Her name is not Luderisha.

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
Her name is...

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
I like The Sugar.

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
Because it sounds like a deceptively sweet assassin.

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
Yeah.

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
Her name is also spelled L-U-C-R-E-T-I-Z.

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
And...

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
Her name is also spelled L-U-C-R-E-T-I-Z.

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
And...

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
Her name is also spelled L-U-C-R-E-T-I-Z.

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
And that's pronounced Lucretia.

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
Maurice has informed us.

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
I don't...

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
It seems like you can just sort of have your way with that though, right?

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
If that's my name.

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
If that's how I spell my name.

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
It's Lucretiz.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
Oh, that's a really great, like, DJ name.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
Hell yeah, it is.

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
You know what else is?

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
What?

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
Luda.

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
Got another message here that was sent in for Nazneen and Ian.

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
Or is that a lowercase L?

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
Maybe it's Lane.

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
Let's stick with Ian.

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
All right, Ian and Nazneen.

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
It's from Courtney and Kyle who say,

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
Congrats on your wedding, which we know we definitely had fun at.

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
You two are the greatest humans,

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
and what better way to tell you

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
than by letting the McElroy brothers do it for us.

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
The wedding was so great.

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
Yeah, I'm assuming they bought this message far in advance.

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
Which, by the way,

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
if you want to get up on our show and tag it,

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
then you gotta go to

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
jumbomfun.org forward slash jumbotron

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
and get your message in early.

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
Because we're booked up pretty

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
deep in advance, and

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
it's unfortunate, but that is

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
why Courtney and Kyle kind of had to roll the dice

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
on this one.

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
But happy wedding. I bet it was beautiful,

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
and I bet Courtney got a little too drunk.

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
Maybe, like, said some things

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
into the video camera.

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
No, no, no, no, no. Courtney locked it down.

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
Yeah? Do you think she started the dancing?

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
I think she started the dancing.

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
I think she was stone cold sober when she did it.

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
I think she was in full, like,

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
sound mind and body.

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
Just, like, got up there and nae nae'd all the night long.

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
Just nae nae'd

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
and whipped?

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
Nope. Nobody whips anymore.

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
Everybody just nae nae's, and she nae nae'd

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
all night long. Even during the slow songs.

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
Even during the father-daughter dance.

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
Excuse me, Courtney.

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
Could you just take a quick break?

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
Just a two minute? No? Okay, that's fine.

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
Put the breaks on it.

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
What other shit do we have to talk about?

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
Oh, big, big, big, big thanks to John Roderick.

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
John Roderick, you're the coolest dude ever

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
for doing our intro.

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
Just every week,

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
but also at the Seattle live show specifically.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
That was a real treat for us.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
We also want to remind everybody

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
that we have another live show coming up.

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
If you're listening to this and thinking,

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
oh, I wish I could have been there.

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
I wish I could see them live.

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
We're doing a live show for My Brother, My Brother, Me

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
and the Adventure Zone at LA PodFest.

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
You're probably listening to this and thinking,

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
but I'm nowhere near Los Angeles,

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
and I don't want to go to that dump city.

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
Well, that's mean.

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
It's very mean of you, but that's fine.

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
We love it.

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
I love LA.

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
If you go to LAPodFest.com

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
and click on live stream,

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
the thing is, we're going to be live streaming

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
all the shows from LAPodFest.

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
You can watch them live.

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
You can watch us do My Brother, My Brother, Me

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
and the Adventure Zone live from anywhere.

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
LAPodFest.com, click on live stream,

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
use the coupon code BROTHER or ZONE

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
and you can watch them along with all the other shows.

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
The greatest thing is this,

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
you don't even have to be at your computer

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
at the time when the shows happen.

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
They're going to archive it for a month.

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
You have 30 days to catch it.

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
It's a great deal.

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
Use the coupon code BROTHER and ZONE.

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
It saves you $5 and it helps support our show.

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
We love it.

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
Hi, I'm Lisa Hanawalt.

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
And I'm Emily Heller.

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
And if you're not listening to our podcast Baby Geniuses,

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
you're missing out on stuff like...

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
Who's like, would you ever go to a friend

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
and you're like, hey, could you

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
lick all these envelopes for me?

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
You'd be like, you're a serial killer.

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
Definitely, I'm leaving right now.

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
It was just a great moment of like,

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
oh no, I'm here, boys.

41:13.000 --> 41:17.000
I'm on this side of the bench.

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
Just feel like they're always in character.

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
Like, they're always in character

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
as like, cool hipster girl.

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
And I just want to

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
break through that barrier.

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
Plus, every week we explore a new Wikipedia page

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
and talk to a crazy expert in the field of nonsense.

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
Well, any hack

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
can make you not have a boner.

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
I mean, it's about how you do it.

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
And we're the only podcast

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
with regular updates about Martha Stewart's pony

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
or your money back.

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
We're not going to give them their money back, are we?

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
No. Let's keep it.

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
Listen to our show every other Monday

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
on Maximum Fun.

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
Yay!

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
Should we throw it to the audience

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
for questions?

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
I believe we should.

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
So, from time to time in our live shows,

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
we throw it to the audience to get some questions

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
from you.

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
Can we get house lights?

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
There is one rule.

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
I don't know what that rule is.

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
No bummers!

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
That's correct. No bummers.

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
You can't all yell it at once.

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
Just you, horse trainer.

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
She doesn't know the rule. It's no bummers.

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
It's actually emblazoned.

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
If you forget, actually we have a helpful

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
mnemonic device.

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
Our friends at Ear Trumpet Labs in Portland

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
made us a microphone.

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
It's a Josephine model mic you can see before you.

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
It is emblazoned with the words

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
no bummers.

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
It's actually engraved on there

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
in case you forget.

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
Should we get a little bit more house?

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
Super duper can't see.

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
Who feels

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
that they have a great question

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
short,

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
fun, no bummers?

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
Breezy? Right here.

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
Right there.

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
Yes, you. Stand up.

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
Right there. Yes, you.

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
Come on down.

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
We pointed

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
at somebody last night in Portland

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
and three people started to walk down

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
like no. We almost left the stage.

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
You can do it. Oh shit, we didn't think

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
about this. Just scooch. Scooch.

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
These two kind people right here

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
are going to let you pass. It's like a whole

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
thing. Scooch.

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
Perfect. Come on down to Josephine.

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
Our mic. I'm not scooching.

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
Okay. Hi. Hi.

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
Hi. Yeah, go ahead and move that out. Yeah,

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
it's good. I like your initiative. Thank you.

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
What's your name? Summer.

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
Hi, Summer. What's up? Well, I'm here.

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
Is that good

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
or bad? You said it ain't no bad.

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
It's pretty good so far.

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
Nice. Well, I like that you left

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
the window open in case we tank at the end.

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
So far, I don't

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
want to say.

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
Okay, so my question is I'm

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
babysitting my dog up at college right now

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
while my parents are moving.

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
And I'm wondering... Your dog's

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
just dog sitting.

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
Dog sitting. Yeah, he's my family's dog.

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
Cool. His name is Jack.

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
That doesn't matter. It does to me.

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
Hold on. We don't know what matters yet.

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
You haven't finished the question.

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
Your question could be what do you think of his

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
name?

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
So I'm wondering if I have

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
like a guy over, is it okay

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
to engage in

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
intercourse in front of my dog? What?

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
This is a family show.

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
This is a family show.

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
You know what I love about the summer, can I say?

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
What I love about this

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
is how much you

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
narrowed it down to that one factor.

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
Like it's a binary

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
decision. The dog's there.

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
Does that change things?

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
It doesn't

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
sound to me like it does.

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
I feel like we need to know everything

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
about this dog.

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
Yeah, my first question is can this

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
dog chill or what?

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
He's chill. He's a German

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
Shepherd.

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
He's only four years old.

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
Well, hold on.

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
Hold on. Dog years, he's at least

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
24, maybe 28.

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
I think right now he's about 32.

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
Oh man, if he doesn't know about this then.

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
He's seen some shit.

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
Please, Travis.

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
Tell me the age at which it's cool

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
for your dog to watch you fuck.

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
Please tell me that

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
number.

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
Three.

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
That sounds bad.

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
That sounds so bad. There's not an age

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
where it's like, oh, he's a 27

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
year old? Then by all means

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
have him watch or have sex.

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
If he's old enough to drive away and go do

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
something else.

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
He's a dog. Can you explain? That's his

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
fault. Yeah.

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
Lot of variables.

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
What's the layer? Is it a studio

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
apartment?

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
Does he have another room to go to if he doesn't

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
feel comfortable? Yeah.

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
I'm going to be in the basement

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
summer. He's in the

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
bedroom. Why?

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
Close the damn door.

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
Is this a fucking Frank Lloyd Wright

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
house in which there are no walls and doors?

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
Because if so, you have an issue.

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
If not, simple solution.

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
I think he's asleep.

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
This is my new house.

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
Summer.

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
The issue you're asking is, is it okay

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
if I like the fact that my dog watches me

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
have sex? Yeah, that's the real question.

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
Is there more house?

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
Is he a

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
raptor from Jurassic Park and he's figured out

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
how to open doors?

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
Is he smart? He's too damn smart.

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
He's kind of dumb.

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
Okay. Cool.

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
Then put on cartoons in the living

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
room. Let him have a great

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
time. I just don't want to leave him

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
unsupervised.

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
That's fair, yeah. Because you're setting

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
such a good example so far.

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
Travis!

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
Love it. Listen.

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
Love making is...

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
Or just fucking whatever it is.

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
It's beautiful no matter what.

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
Just some good old natural fucking.

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
You know what? I say go

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
for it. And then point

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
at him and do this.

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
No. Travis is now pointing

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
at his eyes and pointing

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
and I'm assuming what is

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
the dog's eyes.

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
Now, Travis, that is equally upsetting

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
if you're saying, hey dog, I'm watching you

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
or hey dog, watch this.

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
That's a good one.

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
Let me show you how it's done.

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
Let me show you how it's done.

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
I'm sorry Summer, but thank you so much for coming

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
out. Thank you.

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
Alright, let's see.

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
Let's see.

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
Who else has got a slam dunk question?

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
Let's go right to it.

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
You in the glasses.

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
Yes, yes, with the yes.

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
Yes.

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
I see there that you're holding a poster.

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
Or you were holding a poster.

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
It's this poster here.

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
I hope it's our poster.

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
It was made by Emily Carroll and it's beautiful

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
and amazing and it's my favorite thing ever.

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
And it's affordably priced.

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
Hey, what's up?

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
What's your name?

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
My name is Rosh.

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
What's up?

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
You know.

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
Are you enjoying the show?

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
You know it's rough?

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
I do know, dude.

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
The show is great.

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
Top notch.

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
Is it the best show you've ever seen?

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
Shut up.

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
Are we doing all shows?

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
Podcasts?

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
So I have an etiquette question.

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
We're good at that.

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
So I have this pet peeve when people say

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
excuse me, but you're nowhere near them.

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
You know what happens all the time?

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
People are just like, oh, excuse me.

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
You're standing outside the bathroom, but you're not in the way.

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
And they're like, excuse me.

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
And then they just walk by.

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
And it's like, why the fuck did you say excuse me?

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
I'm not even in your way.

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
And I find it insinuating as if I'm just loitering outside.

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
So do I say no?

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
Or do I say yes?

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
No, now, Rosh,

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
can I tell you right now? I do that.

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
And the reason is, excuse me,

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
as a placeholder for this, I'm awkward

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
just being around people.

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
Just like, oh, I didn't think

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
a human would be here. Excuse me.

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
And all you have to say is, I get it.

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
Yeah.

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
There's a, I think,

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
when this happens, those people are using

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
excuse me

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
in the Japanese style.

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
Because the Japanese sumimasen

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
could be used for

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
literally anything.

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
Good morning. Happy birthday.

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
Welcome home.

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
Excuse me. Happy birthday. I'm sorry.

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
It's a

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
it's a power word.

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
And I think that might just be how I

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
It's a power word? Like a Fremen power word?

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
Like a Tovahkiin

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
shout.

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
Should I say it back then to assert dominance?

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
Excuse me.

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
No, excuse me.

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
You are excused.

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
I don't know.

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
Is this the thing? Am I crazy?

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
No, it definitely happens.

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
Well, hold on. Two aren't mutually excusable.

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
It is a thing.

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
I don't know if you're crazy. We just met.

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
Fair enough.

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
Maybe just say excuse me

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
longer than they did and louder.

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
Just say excuse me right back.

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
Excuse me.

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
What if you just said okay.

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
Excuse me.

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
Silence.

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
No, Rosh. Silence.

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
Let it hang there.

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
Let them take the next step.

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
What's their follow up play?

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
What else they got in the tank?

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
Excuse me. I beg of you.

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
Please.

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
I need this.

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
I can't die until you excuse me.

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
I've been trapped in this loop for a hundred years.

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
Please, my spirit, Rosh.

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
Excuse me.

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
Excuse me.

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
Does that answer your question?

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
Perfect.

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
I hope I could help.

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
You.

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
Yeah.

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
Hey, what's up?

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
I'm going to regret this.

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
Oh, cool.

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
What a start.

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
Sounds like we might also.

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
Proposal.

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
What's your name?

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
Casey.

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
Casey, you know the rule, right?

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
It's like on the mic.

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
It is.

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
And that's going to fit your question, right?

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
Yes.

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
It's happened a couple times.

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
Okay.

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
I've classically conditioned myself

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
to have to go to the bathroom at certain locations.

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
Nice.

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
For example, I was hired at a new job

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
every day for six months since then.

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
I had to go to the bathroom when I entered

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
because I smelled it and I had to go to the bathroom.

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
What?

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
That's why human bodies work?

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
It happened at Target and it happened at the library

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
at my university.

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
How can I not do this?

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
Let me understand this.

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
Your sense memory.

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
I told you I would regret this.

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
Your sense memory

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
of Target

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
is so powerful

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
that when you walk into Target,

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
your body must shit.

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
Number two.

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
You see that commercial

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
with the weird old lady and the Jack Russell Terry

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
and you're like, excuse me.

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
I'm afraid I must excuse.

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
I must wait to the loo.

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
I told you I would regret this.

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
You see people shooting arrows

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
at Targets and you're like,

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
pardon me for a moment, if you will.

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
If that were a toilet.

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
You said Target work

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
at the library.

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
Is that an Isaac Mizrahi?

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
Excuse me for a moment.

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
I will be back in exactly 37 seconds.

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
How can I not?

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
You said you were conditioned.

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
No, I'm sorry. It's going to be one of those questions.

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
You said you were conditioned.

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
It seems like classic conditioning.

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
Were you given a candy every time you left the bat?

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
Good job, Casey.

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
I don't know.

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
Open your mouth.

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
Did you get yourself to an icy at the Target Cafe?

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
It was probably

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
popcorn and a hot dog. Let's be real.

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
Wait, you say a hug or hot dog?

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
Hot dog.

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
Okay, much different than what I thought was happening.

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
Casey, there's only one way.

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
You got to eventually just once go to Target

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
and not shoot a duke.

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
Psychologically, shoot a duke at Target

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
and then punish yourself.

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
You start to associate it as a negative.

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
You shoot a duke and then go like,

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
Bad Casey.

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
Can I just stop?

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
Shoot yourself with a spray bottle.

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
I want to stop the world real quick because

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
take a shit at a Target and then punish yourself

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
is definitely the craziest

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
advice we've ever given anyone.

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
100.

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
This is what, like 268?

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
Yeah, we broke the world.

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
Definitely.

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
Go shit at a Target

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
and then hurt yourself

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
100% the craziest

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
thing anyone's ever told anyone to do.

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
I'm going to need to trade you advice

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
for a poster.

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
51 shades of gray

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
go shit at that Target

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
and then hurt yourself.

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
Are you

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
going to be there? Nope.

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
Just chain yourself to a wall

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
as soon as you walk in Target.

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
I can't be trusted.

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
You take this key no matter how much I beg.

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
You to please let me shit

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
your toes, but no matter

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
what I say, I'm going to be a wild animal

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
and I'm going to try to trick you with manipulation.

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
You can't listen to me.

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
Just please don't let me use the bathroom.

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
Oh, by the way, you have to leave here overnight.

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
Could you put

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
Harry Potter on all the screens or something?

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
The whole series,

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
please. I can't just have two hours

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
of entertainment.

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
Are you doing okay?

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
We've been going

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
all the hog up here.

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
Just tell me we helped.

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
Thank you.

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
Let's get one more.

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
Casey, your question made me lightheaded.

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
It was so good.

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
I already picked one.

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
All right.

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
Let's go back on the left.

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
You shaking your hand the most vigorously.

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
Nope. To the right. To the right.

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
You're not going to stand up.

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
It's the guy standing up then.

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
No.

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
While the shape in the back

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
makes their way down, we'll do your question.

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
Keep coming up.

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
We can knock yours out in 10 seconds.

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
This is going to be an easy one.

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
I feel it.

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
Go and go.

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
What's your name? My name is Noah.

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
Noah?

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
You better hurry, Noah.

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
He's coming.

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
Here comes the wind to go.

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
Just wait.

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
Walk super slow. Noah, hit me.

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
Last year, my wife and I had our first child.

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
This doesn't feel like it's going to be a breezy one.

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
No, it's going to take forever.

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
I love her to pieces.

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
She's smart. She's cute.

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
The child.

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
My wife also, but yes, my child.

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
We're talking about a second kid.

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
Honestly, I'm concerned that my first one

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
is my absolute favorite.

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
I will never love anybody more than her.

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
Is it worth it to

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
one and done, we get a score, hold on one,

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
or go for the second and see if we can...

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
Hey, future Noah,

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
you're listening to this episode with your kids,

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
who are now seven and five.

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
Maybe turn it off 30 seconds ago.

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
Yeah, Noah,

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
if you were wondering whether or not

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
you can have a second kid, you have just

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
sealed that deal for yourself, and the answer is

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
no, you can't, because we will put this

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
on the internet and they will hear it.

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
And the internet is forever.

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
The internet is forever, we hope.

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
Is that all there, kid? Yeah.

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
Yeah, I'm sure you will.

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
Listen, I'm no scientist, but yeah.

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
The chances of you going, you're not as good

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
as whatever first baby's name is,

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
hopefully you know what it is, but

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
you're not going to do that,

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
maybe in your dark times,

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
maybe in your quiet times,

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
but you're not going to do it actively all the time.

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
Just go for it?

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
Yeah, dude, go for it.

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
Have that baby.

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
That is the second time

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
we've done a live show, we have created

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
a human being by giving somebody

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
permission to have a child. Hey, what is up?

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
Am I good?

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
Because that guy's question was for real.

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
Well, how good is your question?

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
I love my two kids

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
so, so much.

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
I hate the third.

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
The fourth is okay, but fuck the fifth.

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
But the sixth one though?

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
Anyway, what's up? What's your name?

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
My name is Sam. Hi, Sam.

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
My question cannot possibly compare.

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
Yeah, great. Probably.

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
Mine is probably one of the more Seattle questions.

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
Cool beans. You've come to the right place.

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
Hello, Seattle!

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
Yeah! Scramble bags!

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
All over my face.

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
So, recently

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
I have moved into a home

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
where I am living with my brother-in-law.

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
Cool, cool.

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
And this guy has the hook up to some dank

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
kush.

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
Oh, cool, cool, cool!

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
Now that is marijuana?

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
Right. Yeah.

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
So, here's the thing. I'm a man of loyalty.

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
Cool. Okay.

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
For four or five years or so, I've been going to the same guy.

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
What's his name?

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
We're good. We're good here.

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
What's his name?

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
Let's just call him Weed Josh.

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
I'm a cop.

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
That's all I needed.

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
Best weed name ever. Go ahead.

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
We got him.

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
Kicking Weed Josh's door.

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
Kicking Weed Josh's door.

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
And what would you say are your greatest strengths, Weed Josh?

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
Low prices.

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
You're hired!

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
I like how comfortable you're getting with that microphone, Sam.

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
I'm making myself a home.

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
You're making love to it.

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
If your question is

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
I have too much access to weed,

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
I'm going to John Cena dive off

59:13.000 --> 59:17.000
this stage and tackle you.

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
I can't imagine

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
what a cross that is to bear.

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
Get the John Cena music ready

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
because we might need it.

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
But what's your question for real, though?

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
So, I guess for real, it's like

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
how do I let Weed Josh know, like

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
I don't need his dank.

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
I don't need to drive fifty miles to get it.

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
Is it the distance?

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
That's a big factor.

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
That fools fifty miles from you?

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
I played baseball with this guy.

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
We grew up together.

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
He gives me the deals, but

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
But you have to drive to fucking Olympia to get your

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
Is your worry,

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
Sam, is your worry that Weed Josh

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
will see you smoking and go,

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
but I haven't seen him in three...

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
Hey.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
That's not my purple

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
strain of sticky.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
I thought we were bugs.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
Weed Josh is

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
very clever.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
Weed Josh sounds awesome.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
Weed Josh is on his shit.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
Let me ask you a question.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
Is Weed Josh like a real friend?

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
You know, we've been around.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
No, he's not.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
He's not going to be like one of my like

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
groomsmen or something.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
Not with that attitude.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
How did you meet

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
Joshua? Well,

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
you know how high I am

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
right now.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
It's because of that. He did that for me.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
I, um...

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
Okay.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
Earlier in the show,

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
we told a lady to shit at a target

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
and beat herself.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
Now, keeping that in mind,

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
you saying

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
that someone who sells drugs

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
is going to have a hard time finding

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
other people to buy drugs

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
is the craziest thing I've ever

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
heard on this show.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
To be fair... What am I going to do with

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
all these? But I got all these

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
extra drugs lying around.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
They're just going to

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
spoil. They're going to go rotten.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
Had to throw

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
them out.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
Am I too nice? Yeah, bro.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
You smoke that much weed? Like, what's going

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
on? Is it the dankness or is it the distance

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
that's really throwing you off? Wait a minute.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
What if I have a solution?

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
I fix this for you. Smoke twice

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
as much weed.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
Oh, hey.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
Thank you, Sam. Yeah, we crushed it.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
Hey, listen. Seattle, you've been

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
super-duper nice to us. Thank you so much.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
Yeah, this has been a fucking good show. Thank you very much.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
I'm not scared anymore.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
Can I also just say... I'm not

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
scared anymore.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
People at the back,

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
at the very back of the top of the

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
balcony, I think I love you most of all.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
We want

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
to say a huge thanks to the Moore

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
Theater. It's been super nice being here.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Yeah, super, super cool. Peter's amazing.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Definitely, definitely haunted.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
They got us some really good seafood, and it was delicious.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
Thank you to Billions, which is our

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
booking company. They put this together for us. Our guide

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
Josh is here. He drove

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
all the way. We literally

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
would not be here if it weren't for Josh.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
We wouldn't be a lot of places.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
Thank you to Ear Trumpet Labs that made

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
our Josephine model microphone down

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
there. The No Bummer special.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
Big thanks to Saw Bones

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
for getting things started real right.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
I don't know that we've ever mentioned

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
it before, but John Roderick does our

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
theme song.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
Too true,

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
Travis. Too true.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
We really appreciate him and

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
the long wind. We've got posters

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
by Emily Carroll. They're special for

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
this tour. They're gorgeous.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
They're out in the lobby. They're 10 bucks.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
This one. It's really pretty.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
Her signature's actually in the smoke.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
It's a detail you may have missed.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
That's our seasonal.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
We're a member of the Maximum Fun Podcast Network

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
without whom none of this

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
would ever have happened to us. We're super thankful to them.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
Maximumfun.org

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
is the place to find the best podcasts in the world.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
Finally, I want to say a big

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
thank you, and you may not have seen this coming,

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
to you.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
You've been

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
so nice to us.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
I think that's it. Thank you to everybody who came out

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
to the Pacific Northwest shows.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
Is Vancouver the Pacific Northwest?

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
It's not. They call it Pacific Southwest.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
Do they really? They do.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
We want to say thanks again

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
to NatureBox, where you can order

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
hundreds of great-tasting healthy snacks.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
You can go to naturebox.com slash my brother to sign up

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
for a free sampler box of great-tasting healthy

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
snacks. We also want to say thank you

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
to Ear Trumpet Labs.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
They provided some really

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
amazing microphones for the tour,

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
including a beautiful...

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
We talk about it in the show, but a beautiful

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
audience mic that is emblazoned

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
with the words, no bummers.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
We really, really appreciate it, and we wanted

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
to say thank you. Yeah, thank y'all.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
I think that's it. Let's throw it back to

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
us to wrap shit up.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
Next week will probably be a regular

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
episode, I imagine. We'll save the Vancouver

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
show for when we're traveling to

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
LA, I guess.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
We'll talk to y'all soon.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
I think Griffin has

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
one more Yahoo that we're going to think about

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
and answer next week. Shit.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
What do you got for us?

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
...

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
It's by Yahoo

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
answers user, Delta.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
Who has a zero percent score?

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
No best answers. He's trying

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
his best.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
He's new. He only started

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
June 15th. I got this.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
No hits so far,

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
Delta. Going

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
a little long talking about

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
Delta.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
Delta asks,

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
I like space

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
and dinosaurs?

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
My name is Justin McElroy.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
I'm Travis McElroy. I'm Griffin McElroy.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
This has been my brother and brother. Make kids are damn

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
square on the left.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:31.000
...
