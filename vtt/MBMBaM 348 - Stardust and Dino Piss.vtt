The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:48.400
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother my brother mean advice show for the modern era.

00:48.400 --> 00:54.160
I'm your oldest brother Justin Tyler McElroy. I'm your middlest brother Travis Patrick McElroy.

00:54.160 --> 01:02.000
I'm your sweet baby brother 30 under 30 media luminary Patrick Davis Tyler Griffin McElroy.

01:04.240 --> 01:09.040
Right before we started like literally a half a second before Justin went in he whispered

01:09.040 --> 01:13.920
trust me into the microphone and I do but I am scared as hell I think a little bit don't be

01:13.920 --> 01:19.840
scared don't be scared it's just I haven't I can't I couldn't tell you guys about the intro

01:19.840 --> 01:24.880
okay without spoiling the intro all right give it because then we'll miss the the I don't know

01:24.880 --> 01:32.000
how I've managed to sit on it this long but here it comes the best thing it happened yesterday I

01:32.000 --> 01:36.400
was flying after visiting my brother and his beautiful new baby oh yeah I forgot to text

01:36.400 --> 01:41.520
but did you get home all right yeah I'm fine um I don't know why we do that we all text each

01:41.520 --> 01:46.640
other after we get home from a fight like hey I got home all right as if like what's the what's

01:46.640 --> 01:50.720
the opposite I mean I guess there is an opposite right but it's so powerful because you were so

01:50.720 --> 01:55.840
worried about me all day until well I mean that doesn't hold up in this one because you defo

01:55.840 --> 02:01.200
didn't text or anything but I just always assumed that we as macarons just have no object permanence

02:01.200 --> 02:05.280
and like that's why we need people because as soon as they leave our sides like they're gone

02:05.280 --> 02:11.120
they're going forever until we get the text that's like I'm okay I'm fine thank god you're

02:11.120 --> 02:15.440
more you're more likely to get in a car accident than a plane accident so like should I text you

02:15.440 --> 02:20.880
guys like got back from Arby's it's all good don't worry about it you don't do that I don't

02:21.680 --> 02:27.600
for a long it was a long way away Arby's if it was a destination Arby's hmm all Arby's are

02:27.600 --> 02:31.520
destination Arby's just sorry what was the greatest thing you ever saw in the airport

02:31.520 --> 02:41.200
thank you jeebus uh so I went through Houston and I had to take a little tram uh on the way back

02:41.200 --> 02:47.200
from front to from terminal terminal Houston's a buckwild airport by the way Houston looked at how

02:47.200 --> 02:52.000
every other airport was doing it and was like nah we're gonna try a whole other thing you gotta take

02:52.000 --> 02:59.360
a tram to all the terminals and all and our gates board like 10 10 in a group and you gotta wait to

02:59.360 --> 03:07.120
go down to them it's bizarre it's a weird airport uh but I'm navigating this bizarre system and who

03:07.120 --> 03:19.920
should I see on the tram next to me but mister Craig T. Nelson I got a Craig T. Nelson sighting

03:19.920 --> 03:27.920
fresh uh brown leather jacket of course approximately eight feet tall wearing a very

03:27.920 --> 03:37.440
large ring in Texas the prime primo Craig T. Nelson what was his security detail wearing

03:38.560 --> 03:46.960
uh it was uh Louie and Philip which is his nicknames for his biceps because he's Craig T.

03:46.960 --> 03:53.760
Nelson is he towned he's 72 years old he looks fucking fantastic yeah I there is no way this

03:53.760 --> 03:59.520
human man is 72 years old he looked like a demigod yeah he looks amazing which is you

03:59.520 --> 04:04.880
wouldn't think I think Craig T. Nelson has had some times where um I mean I don't think he was

04:04.880 --> 04:12.000
as toned as cut in uh poltergeist for example um but I guess like I guess as he reached his silver

04:12.000 --> 04:17.040
years he was just like it's time to get serious about my health and so Craig T. Nelson got really

04:17.040 --> 04:23.280
um diesel got really yoked I'm into this I'm so jealous just and I'd love a Craig sighting oh it

04:23.280 --> 04:28.880
was like such a good Craig sighting and the best part of this Craig sighting um is that we were

04:28.880 --> 04:35.360
going to the same gate so like not the same gate but the same because the way they do it there

04:35.360 --> 04:39.600
it's like 10 in a group so like we're going to the same area I guess you made me think for a

04:39.600 --> 04:44.000
second that he was going to the same gate as you and he was getting on a plane to Huntington with

04:44.000 --> 04:50.320
you to go see what Huntington was all about no y'all would know about that um it was kind of

04:50.320 --> 04:58.400
weird that went like I did okay this is embarrassing I did have a moment where I was like

04:59.200 --> 05:10.320
I got a tv show I could go say hi to no abort abort you can't hey uh fellow tv star um it's me

05:10.320 --> 05:15.840
hoops remember my show I uh anyway we're going the same area so I got to just observe Craig

05:15.840 --> 05:23.280
in his day-to-day um perfect gentleman obviously um Houston is an absolute nightmare in terms of

05:23.280 --> 05:30.480
shopping it's more restaurants and shopping than gates I walked past three burger places

05:30.480 --> 05:37.680
to get to my gate we take care we take care of you here in Texas um but any I did see I only saw

05:37.680 --> 05:44.880
one person sort of like make the connection because they felt like they had to and uh I heard

05:44.880 --> 05:49.520
the person like he's walking this way and the person's walking towards me and this person just

05:49.520 --> 05:56.160
goes I love your work that's good and I think that's code for I forgot what coach was called

05:56.160 --> 06:02.000
I forgot the show coach I forgot your name I forgot the name of the show coach your work

06:02.000 --> 06:12.000
your work sports teacher my one shot um I did learn from the swirls later that he's uh or was

06:12.000 --> 06:17.360
on Parenthood yeah he was all over Parenthood um also on Grace and Frankie I mean either but

06:17.360 --> 06:22.400
that's the problem I mean and I just kind of reiterate Craig's he wants to look fucking

06:22.400 --> 06:31.040
great great yeah if I looked like Craig T. Nelson looks now and you knew my age you would be like

06:31.040 --> 06:37.040
he's a really that looks that's a good looking 36 like yeah I would be I would swat bodies with

06:37.040 --> 06:41.840
Craig T. Nelson Justin let me ask you a question because this is a calculation I do anytime I

06:41.840 --> 06:49.200
see like a recognizable um celebrity I do a calculation in my head of is this is this the

06:49.200 --> 06:54.960
type of celebrity are they at a place down their career are they the type of person that if I walk

06:54.960 --> 07:00.400
up to them and talk to them they will be happy that someone came up to them or will they be like

07:00.400 --> 07:08.720
uh again I'm just trying to walk almost never will they oh good an interruption my favorite

07:08.720 --> 07:13.040
I'm gonna disagree Griffin because I think there's two ends of the bell curve we're like over here

07:13.680 --> 07:19.680
where we are we're happy when people come up and talk to us yes over here we're like

07:20.720 --> 07:25.840
the kid from Jerry Maguire is he's probably happy when people come up and talk to him

07:26.720 --> 07:33.200
you know what I mean but what about in the middle if I had if I had a fucking walk on roll on coach

07:33.200 --> 07:38.320
where I had four lines in one episode where I was sort of a tertiary character you could not talk

07:38.320 --> 07:42.400
to me you could not approach me you know why because I had hung out with Craig T. Nelson and

07:42.400 --> 07:48.800
I'd gotten some of that stardust on me and then that makes me unapproachable so um yes as as of

07:48.800 --> 07:54.400
right now I am to approach me come on come at me but if they ever reboot coach and I'm on it even

07:54.400 --> 08:00.640
a little bit that's it you missed your window uh Craig T. Nelson does not tweet a lot in case

08:00.640 --> 08:08.320
your I almost tweeted at him and uh his last tweet was in 2011 oh well can you read it um word for

08:08.320 --> 08:14.160
word please I've got a lot of requests to weigh in on the PSU scandal as a former coach I think

08:14.160 --> 08:20.480
we need to protect our kids at abc news yeah I mean that's not a not a bad take yeah this is

08:20.480 --> 08:27.200
very important his first tweet was the man only did seven tweets got in got out did his art got

08:27.200 --> 08:32.640
out you didn't overstay his welcome his first one said my personal assistant told me I should be on

08:32.640 --> 08:37.760
twitter I'm still not convinced this is a good idea and it seems like he never quite bought the

08:37.760 --> 08:44.880
bought the company in line there I have a very sorry Joe good I have a very important question

08:45.680 --> 08:54.560
okay when he says a former coach was he actually a coach in real life at some point

08:54.560 --> 09:01.840
how do you mean as a former coach capital c like as one might like David Tennant might say as a

09:01.840 --> 09:07.200
former doctor that doesn't mean he was a doctor in real life at least Craig T. Nelson saying that

09:07.200 --> 09:14.480
as someone who has embodied the role of coach I have a lot of thoughts on this Craig had a lot

09:14.480 --> 09:22.000
of pretty good tweets in this time it is it is wild um it is wild three-month dalliance with

09:22.000 --> 09:26.640
twitter all of which came in 2011 let's go through his whole body of work then why not

09:28.800 --> 09:33.120
let's buy the whole thing so there were there were a couple of applause and I'm so I'm not gonna

09:33.680 --> 09:38.560
uh okay no actually I'm gonna read all of his tweets this is the entire uh tweet

09:39.920 --> 09:46.880
bibliography of Craig T. Nelson uh his next tweet I can't wait for fall tv to start

09:46.880 --> 09:52.960

I really like the show great good good tweet presence so far yeah he's connecting he's figured

10:16.240 --> 10:20.160
out how to like connect with other influencers this is good this is I'm proud of him actually

10:21.840 --> 10:29.520
this is a this is a very buckwild tweet um uh-oh it says is it turning on us at Fox News

10:29.520 --> 10:35.760
and says you should consider following noted author slash outdoorsman Larry Dablemont he just

10:35.760 --> 10:42.000
joined and I love his stuff so what if I could just get this clear hold on Craig T. Nelson is

10:42.000 --> 10:46.400
tweeting at Fox News to tell their Twitter account to follow a guy he knows named Larry

10:46.400 --> 10:50.640
that just joined because he's a noted outdoorsman and he loves this stuff if you click through to

10:50.640 --> 10:58.160
Larry Dablemont it is now registered to someone named Eric Cohen so Larry also this is this is

10:58.160 --> 11:04.720
Craig's fourth tweet and he's telling the Fox News Twitter account has to better utilize the

11:04.720 --> 11:12.960
medium of Twitter um the next tweet dear coach fans I will be he may as well just said dear

11:12.960 --> 11:19.680
everyone dear everyone dear coach dear coach fans I will be making a special appearance in Springfield

11:24.960 --> 11:35.600
years ago next tweet this man brings it all together he says at Larry Dablemont my agent

11:35.600 --> 11:41.280
encouraged me to read your blog I love it maybe we can get a hunt in when I come in to Missouri

11:41.280 --> 11:50.960
for cider days this is like an ARG what's going on and then he talks about the PSU scandal the end

11:50.960 --> 11:56.880
of cranking out that's that's seriously the seven tweets you meet in heaven that's the only seven

11:56.880 --> 12:02.000
tweets you need is what's up I don't want to be on here but here I am yeah I was on coach I found

12:02.000 --> 12:08.400
this dude anyway this is cool um hey dude hey Fox you should follow this dude hey dude you want

12:08.400 --> 12:12.800
to go home when I come in town for cider days by the way come at me if you're a fan of coach

12:12.800 --> 12:18.000
I think the PSU scandal is really is really really uh bad it's really bad what happened over there

12:18.000 --> 12:24.800
coach out but I I tweeted all I could tweet there's nothing I've hit I oh see that's the

12:24.800 --> 12:30.800
thing you got to spread out your seven subjects of tweet over like several years and he used all

12:30.800 --> 12:37.600
seven twitter subjects up yeah and what Larry Dablemont Larry Dablemont part two and a scandal

12:37.600 --> 12:43.840
he like he hit all the bullets crushed it crushed it I should mention two things the first one is

12:43.840 --> 12:49.040
that is not a verified account oh god there's every chance that might not there is no it is

12:49.040 --> 12:56.000
the best it is the best evidence of Craig T Nelson's twitter presence because I was going to

12:56.000 --> 13:01.520
tweet out and be like Houston what's up check out the whataburger it's dope as hell um but I didn't

13:01.520 --> 13:05.040
do that because he had been off for so long and I thought that would have been a little bit pitiful

13:05.040 --> 13:12.640
secondly welcome to max fun drive week part two uh sorry about spending 13 of your minutes I have

13:12.640 --> 13:16.080
one last thing one last thing one last thing do you think the t in his name stands for twitter

13:16.080 --> 13:20.560
because he's so good at it and then one actual last thing is the answer that question is no

13:20.560 --> 13:24.800
nobody knows what the t stands for because once somebody speaks that out loud he's banished

13:24.800 --> 13:30.560
from this realm can I also say just one I also just want to say I'm sorry for saying that Jonathan

13:30.560 --> 13:35.200

15:26.560 --> 15:32.080
our program because of the extended extended period of time we spent talking about Craig

15:32.080 --> 15:38.720
Twitter Nelson uh here comes our first question I've been dating this guy for a few weeks and

15:38.720 --> 15:45.360
I went to his apartment recently I found out that he lives with two other people but zero tables

15:46.480 --> 15:52.160
there's not even a kitchen table their kitchen area is just a pile of groceries

15:53.360 --> 15:57.840
it's bothering me that my boyfriend doesn't own a table anywhere in his apartment oh my god

15:57.840 --> 16:05.680
how do I buy a table for another person without it being weird that's from tabletop troubles in

16:05.680 --> 16:12.400
Topeka well first of all congratulations to these folks doing it in the Japanese style that's really

16:12.400 --> 16:18.160
cool this is not the Japanese style it's important that everybody they definitely got tables the

16:18.160 --> 16:22.080
tables are maybe a little bit lower than you're used to but they are elevated off the ground

16:22.080 --> 16:28.080
this is an this is an incredible opportunity for you yeah because it's like you're gonna give

16:28.080 --> 16:35.120
them a transformative gift something yeah what if they just don't know yeah what is this what

16:35.120 --> 16:40.880
what is this four-legged high floor what the high floor do you mean the table that I bought you

16:41.600 --> 16:49.760
the up floor um I'm more okay what's more upsetting the lack of tables or

16:49.760 --> 16:56.880
or their kitchen area is just a pile of groceries yeah I'm confused by that like

16:56.880 --> 17:01.680
do they not have a refrigerator either do they live on paper street like they don't have cabinets

17:01.680 --> 17:07.520
they don't have counters how the crap it are we talking here are they in some kind of Frank Lloyd

17:07.520 --> 17:12.480
Wright house where everything is the same level there's no couches there's no counters this is

17:12.480 --> 17:18.320
my new house nasty kitchen and what I've done here is there's no furniture so you just keep all your

17:18.320 --> 17:23.920
your eggs and stuff right on the floor right it's called flat town call it yucky flat town

17:25.600 --> 17:36.400
um I don't I think you should get start off small start off small with like an end table

17:36.400 --> 17:42.960
that you put in the middle slowly a nightstand perhaps um I was gonna suggest actually maybe a

17:42.960 --> 17:51.040
card table because what that does is like I want you to try out this life but if you don't like it

17:52.000 --> 17:59.600
then you can just throw it away or put it in a closet or something let it fold fold it up and

17:59.600 --> 18:04.160
and put it away and then you don't have to ever think about it again so it's not like a you have

18:04.160 --> 18:10.400
to live with this forever kind of situation you only need one really good table right

18:10.400 --> 18:15.200
mm-hmm oh we have a we have a coffee table and a dining room table and like a kitchen counter

18:15.200 --> 18:19.920
and really the coffee table is the only one we really use so you just need the one good table

18:19.920 --> 18:23.600
like what do you play your board games on you just set it down on the floor and hunch over it

18:23.600 --> 18:30.960
that's not good for you or your back you know maybe this is like a life whatever the life-changing

18:30.960 --> 18:36.560
joy of tidying up or whatever the book's called where life's actually think life-changing magic

18:36.560 --> 18:40.560
of tidying up I think yeah when they walk up to their tables they put their hands on it and they

18:40.560 --> 18:46.800
thought does this bring me joy and they thought no this is just a flat surface I hate this actually

18:46.800 --> 18:53.200
guys I got an outside the box one for you does this table bring any of you joy and it's like

18:53.200 --> 18:59.760
you know what kind of thick no all we we just throw our bills on there and then we they piles

18:59.760 --> 19:05.600
up it looks terrible let's not table yeah let's not does this guy does this bring you guys joy

19:05.600 --> 19:08.960
all it does is it sits in this little compartment we never look at it are you talking about the hot

19:08.960 --> 19:13.280
water heater yeah fuck that thing get the fuck out of here I hate you hot water heater it's just

19:13.280 --> 19:18.080
taking up space it's just taking up space and we never see it oh boy my shower is so cold now but

19:18.080 --> 19:23.680
fuck that hot water heater I'm too proud to go back also my metabolism is raging I feel amazing

19:23.680 --> 19:31.360
it's wild my skin is clean and clear and under control um does this bring you joy no it stinks

19:31.360 --> 19:35.840
all the time get rid of it this is the trash can you wanted to get rid of the trash can where's

19:35.840 --> 19:40.480
the trash go all over we did we sort of dissipate the stink by hiding it all over the house

19:42.160 --> 19:47.120
no I can't see what food we have yeah but it's the refrigerator yeah but it hides the food away

19:47.120 --> 19:53.920
I want to see the food it's gone get out of here you joyless cube does this bring me joy it's hard

19:53.920 --> 19:59.280
and I fall on it oh that's the floor now you've gotten rid of the floor it doesn't bring you joy

19:59.280 --> 20:06.560
but I do think it is important to be around for sure now just taking up space no wasting everybody's

20:06.560 --> 20:12.960
time um get them a table you need a fucking table now I'm turning I'm starting to get kind of

20:12.960 --> 20:17.760
frustrated now get them a table is it maybe the apartment's like cramped or something and so

20:17.760 --> 20:24.080
they don't have a lot of table room but it's such an essential you gotta have a table it's

20:24.080 --> 20:28.880
the table's a chair's best friend here's here's my theory this is my working theory on why they

20:28.880 --> 20:34.960
don't have a table when Teresa and I moved from Cincinnati to Los Angeles we got rid of our old

20:34.960 --> 20:40.880
microwave and said we'll just get a new microwave when we get there okay then we got there and did

20:40.880 --> 20:46.480
not immediately buy a microwave and then time began to pass and the momentum of not having a

20:46.480 --> 20:51.920
microwave built up and built up to the point where in the entire two years we lived in Los

20:51.920 --> 20:57.280
Angeles we never bought a microwave because after a while like it there was just no pressure to do

20:57.280 --> 21:01.200
it because it like it already been six months we just hadn't bought one yet and then when we moved

21:01.200 --> 21:07.680
back to Cincinnati the house we moved into had a microwave uh in it already like attached to the

21:07.680 --> 21:13.840
oven and like we remembered oh fuck yeah microwaves are incredible how did we go two years without

21:13.840 --> 21:18.720
one so my theory is these people moved into this place none of them had a table and they said oh

21:18.720 --> 21:24.880
we'll go get one of those and then like they just didn't for a while and now like just time has passed

21:24.880 --> 21:30.400
and they've begun living their lives without a table and they have forgotten how fucking efficient

21:30.400 --> 21:36.240
having a section of the floor raised up to a reachable level is the up floor it's wild um can

21:36.240 --> 21:39.440
you read this next question because i was going to do a yahoo but this next question is funnier

21:39.440 --> 21:46.320
than any yahoo could ever dream to be i just found out the guy i'm dating puts his belt on his pants

21:46.320 --> 21:56.880
before he puts the pants on his body all time am i good or do i need to end things now before i

21:56.880 --> 22:07.040
realize he's actually an alien that's from dating et in boston that's the wildest literally a million

22:07.040 --> 22:13.280
roaches living inside of vincent d'anofrio alien yes yes yes sugar water sugar water sugar water

22:13.280 --> 22:20.000
for sure definitely definitely definitely 100 a bunch of d'anofrio roaches you need to get out of

22:20.000 --> 22:24.400
the house swat maneuvers slice the pie don't let him see you he's a bunch of roaches in his skin

22:24.400 --> 22:29.840
man you have to go you have to go go go go go quick the cab's outside i called it for you already get

22:29.840 --> 22:34.640
in there he's a bunch of roaches in an alien skin suit i think she should probably alert the

22:34.640 --> 22:40.720
authorities oh yeah first because you don't want him to run this grift on some other unsuspecting

22:40.720 --> 22:45.120
earthling person i mean there are some specific authorities you need to call and they are the men

22:45.120 --> 22:50.400
in black because i mean it's it's it's i don't know how you get in touch with the men in black

22:50.400 --> 22:56.480
i don't know what like no what if she calls the men in black the men in black are gonna come and

22:56.480 --> 23:01.920
they're gonna like do the flashy thing to us and all of our listeners and erase this episode they're

23:01.920 --> 23:06.960
gonna erase the episode they've definitely done it before too don't you think yeah that's what

23:06.960 --> 23:11.520
happened to the portland audio from our last live show from our last live show um too close to the

23:11.520 --> 23:15.280
truth we got too close so we did get into some next level shit well they only flashed travis

23:15.280 --> 23:24.800
because we only lost his audio how could a person do this to me how could a person do this to me

23:24.800 --> 23:28.640
i've been trying to run through my head like sometimes we get questions like this and you

23:28.640 --> 23:34.080
think like okay i can see one factor where maybe this is why they do it because this would be but

23:34.080 --> 23:40.240
i cannot imagine an element of this where this system is better where you'd rather have floppy

23:40.880 --> 23:46.960
like just a denim mess that you're trying to thread your yeah your leather friend through

23:46.960 --> 23:52.000
like do you want to start do you want to start your day with some needlepoint like i would rather

23:52.000 --> 23:56.320
i would rather not i would rather just go ahead and put on my pants if that's okay with you

23:56.960 --> 24:03.440
it's it's it would be so much harder to do it's very difficult to get it in your floppy loose

24:03.440 --> 24:09.840
loose trousers and it's so weird to do it's not good i don't understand especially when

24:09.840 --> 24:14.960
you picture this person just sitting there in you know they're i was gonna say me undies but

24:14.960 --> 24:20.160
probably not me undies but that me undies seems above the level of this part they're just sitting

24:20.160 --> 24:27.200
there and like you know their um briefs just like calmly silently threading a belt through their

24:27.200 --> 24:31.840
pants now i devil's advocate and i'm using that term literally because it's possible this person

24:31.840 --> 24:37.040
is actually the devil um sometimes it can be hard to get it in that back loop that you can't see so

24:37.040 --> 24:43.200
good that's right under your sacrum or whatever and so maybe this is this person's maybe they're

24:43.200 --> 24:46.720
on some next level shit right like we always got to give them the benefit of the doubt maybe they're

24:46.720 --> 24:51.920
on some next level shit i have some trouble getting in that loop not a lot of trouble that

24:51.920 --> 24:58.160
has led me to institute some pretty major life changes like this person has but maybe they just

24:58.160 --> 25:02.080
like tried to get into that back loop one too many times it was like fuck this i'm doing it off my

25:02.080 --> 25:08.080
body from now on i'm done missing loops i'm done with the whole thing but but missing loops is one

25:08.080 --> 25:13.440
of the top 10 reasons that you have an so like you get into relationships so that you have someone

25:13.440 --> 25:20.320
else in your life to say like hey you missed a loop you missed a loop stupid um all right i'm

25:20.320 --> 25:25.040
gonna don't can i read a yahoo now or is do we have more things to just drag this person for

25:25.040 --> 25:30.400
i just don't i'm trying i feel like okay i feel like our specific brand of comedy is two things

25:30.400 --> 25:38.160
one so random just really like like family guy used to be yeah but the other thing about it is

25:38.160 --> 25:44.560
that it's positive i want it's like travis said i want to come up with something before i want to

25:44.560 --> 25:51.040
leave some sliver of light so this person is just not like we've just banished their beloved to

25:51.040 --> 25:55.680
some sort of extra realm and i really would like to come with some sliver of light that might

25:55.680 --> 26:00.480
give them like just let them sleep because this is a comedy podcast and they're not going to act

26:00.480 --> 26:04.400
on any of this but they do have to sleep next to this person i want to give them something to cling

26:04.400 --> 26:08.720
to here's what you should do here's what you need to do once again i think just like the table

26:08.720 --> 26:13.680
scenario tell this person like hey have you ever thought about putting your belt on after you put

26:13.680 --> 26:20.960
your pants on and then watch the light come over their face as they're like yeah this is another

26:20.960 --> 26:26.480
it's another opportunity to change this person's life maybe um i have a changing joy of putting

26:26.480 --> 26:30.880
on your pants and then putting the belt on putting on putting your pants on normal like a person

26:30.880 --> 26:37.280
marie khan marie says you should um touch all the articles of clothing and let them sort of tell you

26:37.280 --> 26:41.600
what they want that you should thank them after like if you wear your shoes all day you should

26:41.600 --> 26:48.080
thank your shoes and um sorry who's this saying who's saying these wild things marie kondo for

26:48.080 --> 26:53.120
of the author of the life changing magic of tidying up okay um which traps and i both

26:53.120 --> 26:59.120
reference now um and i guess we're just that we're just kind of a fixture yeah um but she

26:59.120 --> 27:05.760
says you should talk to your clothes maybe he talked to his pants and they were like oh you

27:05.760 --> 27:14.080
know it'd be so nice treat me so right hey douglas um as long as i've got you here um you know it

27:14.080 --> 27:24.960

it's uh but for asking this thank you for your courage douglas asks is willam defoe trying to

29:37.440 --> 29:43.360
tell me something in my dream i forgot about willam defoe when i seen spider-man for the first

29:43.360 --> 29:48.080
time i was nine when i seen the movie and when i got introduced to him again when i watched

29:48.080 --> 29:52.640
mississippi burning i had this dream about him i was laying in my bed and closed my eyes and the

29:52.640 --> 29:58.000
next thing you know it's black i can't see a thing then suddenly willam defoe pops into my dream from

29:58.000 --> 30:03.040
nowhere he's smiling at me and so focused he mouthed something to me that is hard to see

30:04.480 --> 30:08.720
he mouthed something to me that is hard to see it was like he was saying thank you to me what does

30:08.720 --> 30:17.040
this mean um there's only one answer to this lala yahoo answers user lala uh gave the answer a new

30:17.040 --> 30:22.000
change in your life and the asker actually rated this answer and gave it two out of five stars

30:22.000 --> 30:25.840
so they were not satisfied with this so i'm hoping maybe we can do a little bit better than mala

30:26.640 --> 30:31.920
um before we get into it i have a quick quick uh question there's a kind of would you rather like

30:31.920 --> 30:37.920
we always do on the show every week would you rather have willam defoe smile at you

30:38.880 --> 30:47.040
or like frown at you scowl at you i can't decide which one is better or worse either way it's a

30:47.040 --> 30:52.960
it's a story um this if willam defoe comes into your dream though and mouths something that you

30:52.960 --> 30:57.920
can't quite hear because you're in the upside down what's what's what's that what does that even

30:58.960 --> 31:03.680
what does that mean is that really willam defoe's like consciousness that he sends out he's a dream

31:03.680 --> 31:11.040
walker okay now we're getting somewhere um i want to i want you all to hop in the time machine with

31:11.040 --> 31:17.440
me we're gonna head back to may 4th 2015 uh episode 250 of my brother my brother invest in the biz

31:18.480 --> 31:26.560
and now i thought this question sounded familiar to me but i was only partially right this is a

31:26.560 --> 31:33.840
question from episode 250 for no reason i've been crying over willam defoe i was in my room watching

31:33.840 --> 31:38.000
one of his interviews and when it finished i turned over to watch tv a few days later i burst

31:38.000 --> 31:42.000
out in tears and i don't know if it was me thinking about willam or it was something else

31:42.000 --> 31:47.840
i haven't been paying attention to him as much as i used to uh i have been doing it for a few days

31:47.840 --> 31:52.160
my boyfriend knows the reason for my crying he's comforted me about it my friend maggie told me to

31:52.160 --> 31:57.360
stop crying and to shut up about willam defoe i've looked up to him since i was nine years old

31:57.360 --> 32:01.840
i'm 17 now though my boyfriend said just remember i'm here for you if you need anything or if you

32:01.840 --> 32:06.000
want to talk about things like celebrities then i'm here for you if you guys are gonna say it's

32:06.000 --> 32:10.800
your hormones it's not i can tell you this isn't going on for days i go outside a lot so don't

32:10.800 --> 32:15.840
say it's that either could someone please help me is crying over a celebrity normal what is willam

32:15.840 --> 32:23.040
defoe okay doing i mean what is he doing he's definitely projecting himself into like some

32:23.040 --> 32:29.440
sort of midnight channel-esque sort of shadow world where he can walk between our consciousness

32:29.440 --> 32:34.000
when it's raining at midnight willam defoe pops up on the tv and tells you um the day you'll die

32:34.000 --> 32:38.560
and the name of your true love so he gives he gives and he takes and also what time spider-man

32:38.560 --> 32:45.920
one is going to be on tbs the answer is always always always always always tbs we've got spider-man

32:45.920 --> 32:53.600
one that's that's their fucking motto um so i don't i don't want to be mean to willam defoe

32:53.600 --> 32:59.440
but i think he's i think he does i think he's you know a shadow that walks between

32:59.440 --> 33:06.160
our collective subconscious you know what i mean yeah i don't think that's mean yeah i mean if you

33:06.160 --> 33:13.280
think about it have you ever you've seen william defoe a lot right i mean not in person exactly

33:13.280 --> 33:20.240
yeah we've never seen william defoe in person isn't that interesting isn't that curious now

33:20.240 --> 33:24.960
just suggesting that anytime william defoe is in a movie he's been uh portrayed in motion capture

33:24.960 --> 33:32.720
by andy circus no i'm saying that he is only lives in movies and tv oh and in our dreams

33:32.720 --> 33:38.720
apparently apparently he's apparently tv movies aren't enough for him anymore and he's just

33:38.720 --> 33:44.160
started to come into our minds directly when alexander graham bell discovered the electronic

33:44.160 --> 33:49.520
transmission he sent a recording of what happy birthday or mary had a little lamb and it was like

33:49.520 --> 33:56.720
mary mary had a little eris fleece was white as snow and then it was like hello daniel daniel

33:56.720 --> 34:03.120
it's me you've set me free it's william defoe i exist here in the midnight channel and ever since

34:03.120 --> 34:09.360
then just everything fucking dallas watch dallas look in the background there he is yeah it's him

34:09.360 --> 34:16.080
he's just looking for a door looking for the door out steve guttenberg opens his printing press he's

34:16.080 --> 34:22.080
so stoked he finally cracked it he stole that wine press technology from the italians and he

34:22.080 --> 34:26.480
made it his own and turned it into a printing press he's so stoked and he lifts it up after

34:26.480 --> 34:30.080
typesetting the first page of the bible and what's there is it the first page of the bible

34:30.080 --> 34:37.200
it is not is the face of william defoe staring him back it made in like ascii art of this guttenberg

34:37.200 --> 34:42.240
press exactly i thought you were gonna say in the in the is it three men and a baby that scene where

34:42.240 --> 34:47.600
there's the shadow behind the curtains that like nobody knew what it was and everybody thinks it's

34:47.600 --> 34:52.160
a ghost no that's william just looking for looking for the looking for his starring role in the

34:52.160 --> 34:56.720
picture he's a good actor though yeah all right work he's a good actor for sure i mean i'm just

34:56.720 --> 35:04.880
saying like have you ever seen him be bad in something never never he's just so consistent

35:04.880 --> 35:11.040
spider-man for sure definitely was not good in that no he was sorry justin he was very good in

35:11.040 --> 35:16.320
that um okay agree to disagree that's fine i mean i think it's a little overblown he played the

35:16.320 --> 35:22.800
green goblin did you want like a reserved quiet performance no my problems with his performance

35:22.800 --> 35:28.320
were probably sam raimi centric to me yeah let's uh let's let's take a moment to talk about the max

35:28.320 --> 35:35.280
fun drive instead of talking about actors for like a fucking second here on this star watch podcast

35:35.280 --> 35:43.200

slash donate um and thank you again thank you thank you thank you without meaning to i have

41:54.560 --> 42:00.880
once again made the first kind of like four questions on a theme of people doing things

42:00.880 --> 42:05.360
that are inexplicable i didn't mean to but we've just been getting so many questions lately

42:05.360 --> 42:10.720
that i think like subconsciously i've started building thematic episodes interesting yeah

42:10.720 --> 42:17.600
um so let's continue with our theme hey brothers so my dad doesn't own a cell phone claiming he

42:17.600 --> 42:21.760
doesn't need one cool instead he'll use the phone at work to call us and tell us when he's coming

42:21.760 --> 42:27.600
home if my dad is anywhere else though and needs to contact us he will either ask a stranger to

42:27.600 --> 42:33.920
borrow their cell phone or ask an employee to use their phone just recently my dad called me and the

42:33.920 --> 42:38.880
caller id said it was mcdonald's i don't want my dad to inconvenience these people any longer

42:38.880 --> 42:43.360
how do i convince my dad to finally get a cell phone and that's from secondhand anxiety in florida

42:44.560 --> 42:53.680
i'm getting thirdhand anxiety from this obviously we recoil from this but is there not a part of you

42:54.640 --> 43:02.640
that thinks like boy that that might be nice yeah it would be nice to be the sort of person that

43:02.640 --> 43:09.840
you could look around and say well everyone else has cell phones i don't think i need one someone

43:09.840 --> 43:15.760
there will have one literally everybody else has them so i think i'm okay there'll be somebody else

43:15.760 --> 43:21.360
around that i can use their cell phone i can't imagine living that i really i can't imagine it

43:21.360 --> 43:27.520
now i have i have thought many times about like you know you go into a movie and like you you know

43:27.520 --> 43:32.960
you silence or turn off your cell phone you should turn it off and i have like a little panic every

43:32.960 --> 43:38.240
time i do of like what if somebody needs to get a hold of me during this hour and 45 minutes and

43:38.240 --> 43:44.160
like i think about what if i just didn't have a phone ever right and i could just like go to dinner

43:44.160 --> 43:47.920
without worrying about oh i felt a buzz in my pocket what if it's important i better check it

43:47.920 --> 43:53.840
because there was a time in our lifetimes where like if you weren't home people would just call

43:53.840 --> 43:57.440
your house and leave a message and maybe you heard it like five hours later and that was fine and

43:57.440 --> 44:02.320
everybody was just okay with that that's cool i like that kind of like wouldn't it be nice to

44:02.320 --> 44:07.680
just have the freedom to not do this for a while but to do that but then also be like hey can i

44:07.680 --> 44:14.320
borrow your your phone this thing that you're doing there's the rub this is our shock at this

44:14.320 --> 44:20.480
is a very privileged like position to take right like cell phones are fucking expensive and like

44:20.480 --> 44:27.040
of course not everybody has one that's kind of a um kind of a whack assumption at at the same time

44:27.040 --> 44:36.240
though like um if i get a call and the call is from mcdonald's that's gonna be maybe the

44:36.240 --> 44:40.240
worst moment of my life because i'm going to i i don't know that i will answer i probably won't

44:40.240 --> 44:46.400
answer that call sorry dad or maybe i will if i expect like oh boy a car from a call from frish's

44:46.400 --> 44:51.920
big boy well this is my dad um that one's gonna be my dad because one time you're gonna answer

44:51.920 --> 44:57.120
your dad what would that call for mcdonald's be like hey did you have some nugs last week yeah

44:57.120 --> 45:01.760
oh boy if you answered there's gonna be one of those though right trav where you answer you're

45:01.760 --> 45:05.440
like dad will you please get a fucking cell phone and it's like hi we're doing a customer

45:05.440 --> 45:13.520
service about the shamrock shake and i'm sorry it's it's it's that part to me is un untenable

45:13.520 --> 45:19.520
your dad is pulling a power play here because think about it think through it if he needs a

45:19.520 --> 45:27.440
cell phone he can get one if you need your dad that's tough nuggies oh you can't get this man

45:27.440 --> 45:34.400
this man is saying to you like no you can't have me i'm i'm elusive i want it to be special when

45:34.400 --> 45:40.240
you nail me when you when you when you manage to to corral me into talking to you it should feel

45:40.240 --> 45:46.560
like an event because it's your dad is holding himself hostage from you exactly yeah exactly

45:46.560 --> 45:52.880
but he's also valuing himself higher so that when you do manage to get a call from your dad it's

45:52.880 --> 45:57.920
like seeing craig t nelson at the airport it's that level of excitement got my dad found him

45:57.920 --> 46:04.560
all right he's at mcdonald's go move move swat team go activate here i here's what you should

46:04.560 --> 46:10.720
do i thought i think i have an answer okay you should tell your dad that you've been getting uh

46:10.720 --> 46:16.960
like some uh like uh telemarketers and some you know kind of scam calls and you're not answering

46:16.960 --> 46:22.800
calls from unknown numbers anymore but i mean that doesn't work that doesn't work the caller

46:22.800 --> 46:28.000
id tells you that it's from mcdonald's then that's all the answer if you call me from that mcdonald's

46:28.000 --> 46:32.560
because it's a number i know and they use the code word ducktales then i'll know and i'll

46:32.560 --> 46:43.040
code word ducktales then i'll know um i think you should pay someone to to to tag your dad oh

46:43.760 --> 46:49.120
i think you should get someone like graffitium no i think you should get someone to tranquilize

46:49.120 --> 46:55.680
it up on my dad tranquilize your dad okay well that's very expensive what griffin is suggesting

46:55.680 --> 47:01.680
is a tale i don't think a dad tale is necessary i don't think every time poor um oscar the dad

47:01.680 --> 47:06.320
looks at his rear view mirror and sees like a white camaro the same white camaro that's always

47:06.320 --> 47:11.520
there i don't think he needs that in his life that seems like a lot what i was suggesting was mark

47:11.520 --> 47:18.880
echoes get up on my dad get up on my dad and put your art up on my dad your spray that i'm suggesting

47:18.880 --> 47:27.840
that you tranquilize him and you give him like an uh a gps tag geocaching so geocache your dad and

47:27.840 --> 47:33.840
then call then you can just like call the nearest phone to your dad wherever if you need him you

47:33.840 --> 47:39.120
just see what phones are around there yeah and call and say like hey can you yell the name oscar

47:39.120 --> 47:44.640
very loud to try to get oscar the dad over here so i may speak with him about whether or not he

47:44.640 --> 47:50.560
wants to go see rogue one this afternoon please if you have a moment um i have a very related

47:50.560 --> 47:56.160
yahoo that i'm i would be delighted if you all would let me read okay i was sent in by Amelia

47:56.160 --> 48:01.280
Burger thank you Amelia it's by yahoo answers user derk and it's it's a similar vein of like

48:01.280 --> 48:07.520
how to how did folks get in touch without phones right but the wording of this question is maybe

48:07.520 --> 48:36.880
the best derk asks how did people know when to meet back in vampire times i know

48:36.880 --> 48:41.360
i know that they wrote more letters you gotta let me get through it i know that they wrote

48:41.360 --> 48:45.520
more letters and stuff but back in vampire times how did you make plans with friends

48:46.960 --> 48:50.080
did they just wait around all day and hope that they ran into each other

48:56.800 --> 49:00.240
you could make all the plans you want the vampires are gonna ruin them

49:00.240 --> 49:04.640
i mean you could write a letter it's like meet me at ye olde arby's this afternoon but a vampire

49:04.640 --> 49:10.880
is just gonna be waiting there to to harangue you hey meet me there at 2 p.m can't do that

49:10.880 --> 49:19.680
can we make it 2 a.m the sun the sun is an issue the sun is bad for vampires so i mean this is

49:19.680 --> 49:24.960
before i'm gonna set that let's set the let's set the stage it's vampire times there's no

49:26.720 --> 49:30.960
there's no electronic communication which of course means william defoe is still trapped

49:30.960 --> 49:37.360
in that that uh that that you know spectral cage somewhere before alexander graham bell let him out

49:37.360 --> 49:43.440
um and i want to get in touch with you uh i want to get in touch with dad to go see rogue one

49:44.240 --> 49:49.920
do i just like go to the theater and just like hope he like do i just yell out my window like

49:49.920 --> 49:54.560
dad dad dad rogue one rogue one and just like hope that he like falls under the thrall of my

49:54.560 --> 50:01.440
voice somewhere or is it do i do i like uh fucking the end of uh christmas carol just

50:01.440 --> 50:06.480
like pay a boy just be like go find my dad and invite him to the theater to see a live

50:06.480 --> 50:11.120
performance of rogue one you have to send your familiar you gotta send your renfield

50:11.760 --> 50:17.760
right your renfield goes and like delivers the message to your vampire dad and then vampire dad

50:17.760 --> 50:22.160
like gives him i guess some bugs to eat or something and then renfield returns to you and

50:22.160 --> 50:25.680
then actually can i tell you something it was actually a much more efficient system than we

50:25.680 --> 50:33.520
have now i suppose so um in many ways in many ways it wasn't but in many ways it was if you

50:33.520 --> 50:39.840
think about it but like in vampire times how did folks know to meet up though it's a good question

50:39.840 --> 50:45.520
i mean that's why we had public how like public houses right was that a thing i've heard that

50:45.520 --> 50:50.720
term before are those just houses where people could be at and yeah you've been up there for a

50:50.720 --> 50:56.160
bite maybe this is what maybe this is what town criers were doing this is what john criers were

50:56.160 --> 51:00.560
up to where you would go and you'd be like hey town crier can you holler for my dad and just

51:00.560 --> 51:08.720
tell him meet the theater live performance of of rogue one um at at 4 p.m and then we're gonna

51:08.720 --> 51:14.080
run the fuck home before sunset because we don't have movies yet so we're just reading the script

51:14.080 --> 51:19.440
yeah it's a rogue one out loud um and we're gonna get the fuck home before the sun sets

51:19.440 --> 51:28.000
because it's gonna get choppy out here say say you're in your amazing like dave is at pinkberry

51:28.960 --> 51:32.960
everyone dave's at pinkberry like that's what the town crier does he just

51:33.840 --> 51:37.360
broadly announces your locale he's just flipping through index cards just like

51:38.240 --> 51:45.920
greg is at jamba juice susan is at j crew and she's waiting for michelle

51:45.920 --> 51:52.400
well tyler's at orange julius a lot of juice stores back in vampire times

51:55.680 --> 52:03.600
really gentrified here timothy has been killed by a vampire michael has been killed by a vampire

52:04.480 --> 52:11.680
okay i have i have an actual question for you if a vampire was stalking and trying to kill a

52:11.680 --> 52:19.760
specific person okay would it be easier for the vampire to track and kill this person back then

52:20.800 --> 52:26.480
when you there was a limited number of places you could be and you probably should tell somebody

52:26.480 --> 52:32.800
where you're gonna be or else it's gonna be like a whole thing or now when we have like technology

52:32.800 --> 52:37.680
and twitter and everything and like foursquare and what have you when would be an easier time

52:37.680 --> 52:48.080
for a vampire to find find people um here's what i'll say i've got in my house which i i just don't

52:48.080 --> 52:54.720
i don't leave this house because i food is sent to me by blue apron and then i stay inside the

52:54.720 --> 53:01.520
house all day and hang out with my wife and my baby and i play zelda non-stop uh and persona

53:01.520 --> 53:06.240
non-stop and so i just don't leave the house and vampos can't come in here without permission which

53:06.240 --> 53:11.680
i am not going to hand out lightly to a vampo thank you so but i think back in the day it'd

53:11.680 --> 53:17.280
be like time to go outside to the well chomp dead okay you know that's a good point because the

53:17.280 --> 53:22.000
follow-up question i have justin along those same lines is do you think it was easier back

53:22.000 --> 53:27.600
in vampire times for a vampire to gain permission to enter your house because everyone was like so

53:27.600 --> 53:33.040
dumb and trusting and now everyone just hates every other human being and it's a lot harder to

53:33.040 --> 53:37.840
get somebody to let you into their house like if somebody came to my door now not only would i not

53:37.840 --> 53:41.760
let them in i probably wouldn't even go to the door like they'll leave if they have something

53:41.760 --> 53:45.520
for me they'll just leave it there like if they haven't told me they're coming over i'm not letting

53:45.520 --> 53:52.160
them in i always kind of assumed that the vampire has to be invited in thing is something that

53:52.160 --> 53:58.080
vampires made up and spread around because it's so fucking funny can you imagine nothing like it

53:58.080 --> 54:05.920
would be a nightly hilarious event for you to like see some dumb human standing in the window

54:05.920 --> 54:10.240
like neither neither neither you just like pounce through the window and eat them like that's gotta

54:10.240 --> 54:16.080
be the funniest shit yeah um man what happened all the vampos then though because it's not

54:16.080 --> 54:24.320
vampo times now where did they go i bet they're on wall street and that topical because they're

54:24.320 --> 54:30.400
bleeding us dry am i right because they're bleeding us dry yeah man on wall street i bet

54:30.400 --> 54:39.280
they're all bankers money never sleeps suck because they suck blood i guarantee that's

54:39.280 --> 54:44.880
that's got to be a tagline for a movie somewhere right vampire bankers these interest rates suck

54:44.880 --> 54:54.800
something like that something along those lines trading stocks and biting knocks do you mean necks

54:54.800 --> 55:00.640
that's a bad rhyme having having having sex and biting necks and now it's like sexy

55:01.360 --> 55:10.240
like wall street like powerful power mr big mr big up at the top turns out he's a vampire the

55:10.240 --> 55:17.440
whole time and he's the one who wants to be with you um i have a friend that i frequently hold on

55:17.440 --> 55:23.280
i think rachel locked herself out one second there's joe's witnesses right outside my window

55:23.280 --> 55:28.080
so i'm gonna be down here for a little bit okay what are they doing griffin are you okay

55:28.880 --> 55:33.680
they won't leave they keep knocking this is this is literally germane to the

55:33.680 --> 55:37.360
conversation we were just having about not wanting to open the door for strangers

55:37.360 --> 55:42.160
are you okay i mean i'm good i just don't i don't want them to know i'm in here you don't

55:42.160 --> 55:49.600
have to talk to other human beings yeah we're good we're good though let's just move on i bet

55:49.600 --> 55:55.920
jehovah's witnesses by the way would not be so fucking cavalier if we're still in vampire time

55:55.920 --> 56:01.680
absolutely not i i think justin you would find that most people wouldn't be yeah not just yeah

56:01.680 --> 56:05.920
that's a good point let's go ahead and move on to keep do you just take the real

56:05.920 --> 56:09.680
deep do you just take the reins for a little bit i'm riding this one out

56:11.120 --> 56:16.720
i have a friend that i frequently communicate uh via text formats i am twitter text messages

56:16.720 --> 56:21.920
and this friend frequently as a way of expressing playfulness or a joke sincerely

56:23.520 --> 56:33.120
uses the winky emoticon semicolon close parentheses yeah we i know what it is it gives

56:33.120 --> 56:39.920
me the absolute heebie jeebies it makes me feel bad to look at every single time what's a cool

56:39.920 --> 56:45.840
way to get my friend to stop being a text grosso and that is from skeeved by semicolons

56:47.360 --> 56:53.920
i think i don't know people have quirks anymore can't people just have a quark

56:54.880 --> 57:01.360
a fun quark you have to sand the edges off of everyone oscar doesn't want a phone he's a dad

57:01.360 --> 57:06.000
that's his law he could just live it why can't he just live it why can't this person just use

57:06.000 --> 57:11.600
a similar emoticon if they want to sexy wall street vampire just wants to trade stocks and

57:11.600 --> 57:17.280
biting the ox why can't we just let them do that and be them it is murder so that's actually yeah

57:17.280 --> 57:22.160
that one's a crime that was what this isn't fighting the knock doesn't have to be murder

57:22.160 --> 57:27.280
you can stop shy of draining the person that's true let me get a smack a roll of that good good

57:27.280 --> 57:35.840
neck honey um so this do they do this irl and that's another sort of emoticon that means

57:36.560 --> 57:42.640
in the in the flesh world um do they winkle a lot you know do they wink a lot

57:44.080 --> 57:50.240
does it make you lol or does it make you you which stands for uncomfortable um can i oh you've just

57:50.240 --> 57:54.240
remind me i've never i've never had an opportunity to share this story and i really want to it was

57:54.240 --> 58:01.360
very brief anecdote i was listening to uh npr and they did like an ad read for i guess a play that

58:01.360 --> 58:08.160
was going on locally about like you know text and the internet and stuff and the announcer said um

58:08.160 --> 58:15.680
with plenty of jokes uh it'll give you lots of laugh out louds and i just i assume that the text

58:15.680 --> 58:20.240
said lols and they just went ahead and said the whole thing it's one of my favorite things i've

58:20.240 --> 58:24.880
ever heard in my whole life that's so good excuse me laugh out louds that's my if you could review

58:24.880 --> 58:31.200
our podcast and just say that it gave me laugh out louds i would appreciate it um it's it's it's this

58:31.200 --> 58:36.640
is this is this is some this is an easy fix this is a one sentence fix hey that thing that you do

58:36.640 --> 58:42.960
it's like not how you're supposed to use the thing so just think about it like google that

58:42.960 --> 58:48.400
emoticon and its proper usage and then like maybe you could stop doing it because it's inherently

58:48.400 --> 58:54.720
like sexy playful when you wink like we've got a lot of winking questions i'm so old i don't know

58:54.720 --> 58:59.440
what the problem is what's the problem i need like i needed that you should probably see this

58:59.440 --> 59:02.400
question is still buffering because they they could probably handle it that is an excellent

59:02.400 --> 59:07.520
i don't i don't actually know is it bad let me pitch this justin all right two scenarios

59:08.240 --> 59:15.280
had a great time hanging out last night like colon parentheses smiley face oh they had a great time

59:15.280 --> 59:23.600
had a great time hanging out last night winky emoticon yeah it's it's it's it's different

59:23.600 --> 59:30.800
for sure there's a different vibe i texted i just texted you two boys okay yeah

59:32.960 --> 59:36.800
this is innocuous enough i just texted having a great time recording with y'all

59:36.800 --> 59:42.160
and then a winky emoticon the wink makes it seem like there's an underlying secret like having a

59:42.160 --> 59:46.800
great time recording with you all and my balls are with my balls like hanging out in my pants

59:48.960 --> 59:57.440
um i i um i once did a business dealing of a lar like a house transaction with uh a couple

59:57.440 --> 01:00:05.440
and listen a wall street vampire over here one of the people in the house transaction uh use ellipses

01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:13.920
at the end of every text oh man like every single text there was an ellipses so and we were talking

01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:21.520
a lot about like house stuff like we'll have someone look at the wiring dot dot dot so are

01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:27.680
you mad about it yeah are you really not gonna do it i don't understand that's like the most loaded

01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:33.520
yeah uh three periods you can put in anything there's no room for furtive disappointment when

01:00:33.520 --> 01:00:39.200
you're dealing when you're spending a bunch of money on a house i guess i always i always think

01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:44.960
of the ellipses in that scenario is like the thing that people do in like really tense horror movies

01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:51.920
where it's like we haven't seen him in weeks dot dot dot yeah exactly old man at the gas station

01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:59.920
that's like you don't want to go up to that cabin um winky smiley winky wink oops i did the wrong one

01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:08.640
but you want to fog eggplant peach eggplant peach that's my wiener that's your whatever

01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:16.320
taster's choice um how about another yahoo yeah um this one was sent in by ah shit there's a

01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:20.560
lot of really good ones how about this one from irham wisessa thank you irham is by yahoo answers

01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:30.800
user charmista asks does adding flavor to water makes it juice well i want to drink more water

01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:36.480
and only way i think i'd enjoy it is if i add flavor but would that change the water

01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:44.000
into juice and not give me the same benefits as plain water i like this you get that you get the

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:48.400
commercials for that's the you know smart water turbo drops or whatever and it's like add this

01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:54.320
to make your water less boring this is this isn't your dad's water this is turbo drop cool water

01:01:54.320 --> 01:02:00.480
and it turns blue and i guess it has a flavor to it does it stop at that point does it stop

01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:04.400
being water and now it's like well it doesn't make sense to drink what you're supposed to drink eight

01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:11.760
cups of water a day um you can't eat you can't drink eight cups of juice a day right we're gonna

01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:16.160
make a lot of jokes here folks but i want to be honest this is travis pulling back the curtain

01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:21.200
for a second i don't know yeah i know a lot of the times we don't know we sort of figure it out

01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:26.240
by just sort of bouncing off each other just being a couple goofballs here's a here's a question

01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:31.520
right okay so like if i get a diet coke with lemon which is the only way that i get diet coke

01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:39.120
if i get a diet i know if i get a diet coke with lemon and i put some in it it's diet coke with

01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:47.280
lemon if i do that with water i'm i'm hurtling towards lemonade i'm like yeah there is a very

01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:55.040
thin line of deviance from water before it loses the label i feel like this is true because every

01:02:55.040 --> 01:03:01.360
morning i take eight cups of water and i put some ground up shit in it and now it's coffee

01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:05.280
it's not water anymore that's it you guys just unlocked it you guys just unlocked the fucking

01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:09.840
secret and i was hoping we would get here but this is like i'm like morpheus right now like

01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:15.440
welcome to the next level boys because every drink is just water with some stuff in it every

01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:20.720
drink in the world is just you go to one of those fucking make your own flavor adventure soda

01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:25.040
machines and what do you think happens in there you're like i want a orange fanta with a cherry

01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:29.200
splash and a little bit of mountain dew in it that's just they're adding syrups to carbon to

01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:35.600
water that has been added bubbles to it and it's all water folks just with different stuff in it

01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:43.280
you know what i mean that wine wine is just grape water that grapes ate and then they got old and

01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:48.720
squeezed and then that water that took a different form is grape stuff came out and now it's wet ain't

01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:55.440
it it's wet and red and it tastes weird but that's water in there sorta um here's a yahoo i have a

01:03:55.440 --> 01:04:03.520
yahoo answer from oh there not it's not on here i don't know where you would see it i've never read

01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:12.880
one is every drink made out of water yeah that is the question here um and the only this divergence

01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:18.640
from that is pretty much everything you could want to drink contains some water there are potable

01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:25.360
liquids such as glycerin that you could drink even though they are a hydrous which i guess means don't

01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:32.960
hydrate you then it's not a liquid i'm sorry liquid means water plus something it's all

01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:38.720
remixed if you drink fucking beer that's just remixed water does somebody put their fun spin

01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:47.760
on what about milk no it's just water with uh cow leave with cow stuff in it yeah cows drink the

01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:52.640
water and that help if a cow doesn't drink water they die straight up that's what's that's what's

01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:55.840
up and a lot of people won't tell you that i'll tell you that's your face cows die if they don't

01:04:55.840 --> 01:05:00.080
drink water they drink that water it nourishes them and it goes down in their teats and it

01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:05.760
mix up with the cow stuff and it juices out and then i drink it and i get very sick what about

01:05:05.760 --> 01:05:12.320
clearly canadian that might actually damn that might be the exception no it's just water they

01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:17.120
added bubbles to and distinct canadian flavors and it's exciting canadian water next what about

01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:26.320
lacroix lacroix is water with like the most faint a droplet uh i actually think that lacroix doesn't

01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:32.000
have flavoring in it and it's all fucking like psychosomatic like you see a green new clothes

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:35.600
yeah you see a green can you're like this tastes like lime and you drink it and it's like no it's

01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:40.720
just kind of like bubbly water but you're like mm lime yummy yummy yum no it tastes like green

01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:47.440
can because that's what your brain sees next um i have some i i have something that might be

01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:54.560
germane to this and it's like think something to think about along these lines every uh basically

01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:59.920
every molecule of what we of course we have the same you know most of the same water molecules

01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:06.480
here on earth as it will have been on earth did you realize that pretty much every water molecule

01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:12.320
that you drink was at one time peed out by a dinosaur i think about it all the time justin

01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:19.120
that's a pretty i think that's very empowering i think it's a pretty rock and roll thing to be

01:06:19.120 --> 01:06:24.640
able to start your day with a big glass of dinosaur piss we are all made of star stuff and dino pee

01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:30.880
we're you're like i'm how are you gonna start your day you fucking amazing creature well i

01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:36.480
think i'm gonna drink some dinosaur piss and fucking kick ass all day long like yeah that

01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:41.440
sounds pretty rocking that's actually a really good idea most water molecules haven't been

01:06:41.440 --> 01:06:44.960
drunk by people before you're not drinking second-hand water from people you're drinking

01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:50.160
from dinosaurs yeah you're infinite and powerful think about that the next time you're in a pool

01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:53.920
and somebody says something like oh don't pee in the pool you're like oh fucking t-rex already

01:06:53.920 --> 01:07:00.000
pissed in here shut up dennis dennis you dick pissed it all out did you guys know that the

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:05.600
original name for josta was dino piss but it didn't test well so they changed it to justa

01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:14.800
serge almost nabbed that one too serge was like let's be honest it's dino piss um thank you all

01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:20.960
so much for listening to our podcast uh we want to one more time just remind you that the max fun

01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:25.600
drive is going on this is our last max fun drive episode we'll be back to our regularly scheduled

01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:31.760
programming next week but right now if if you like us if you like our show and you can spare

01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:37.920
a little bit of cash um you know five bucks a month all the way up to two hundred dollars whatever

01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:42.480
you can afford so we talked about we talked about the five dollar level and the ten dollar level and

01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:47.680
the twenty dollar level i would like to tell you about the thirty five dollar level it is one of

01:07:47.680 --> 01:07:54.080
my favorites i know and here's the thing all the rewards stack so at thirty five dollars you get

01:07:54.080 --> 01:07:58.960
the bonus content that you get at five dollars the pen that you get at ten dollars the cuban

01:07:58.960 --> 01:08:05.280
touch kit that you get at twenty dollars but you also get a set of engraved beer mugs with the max

01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:10.800
fun rocket logo right on there now i say beer mugs you can use these for any beverage you want

01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:16.880
it's all gonna be water-based so some kind of water-based beverage in there no glycerin um

01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:24.160
and it's going to make just a stunning addition to any glassware collection that you might have um

01:08:24.160 --> 01:08:29.200
and then at a hundred dollars you get all that stuff plus you get entered into the monthly

01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:34.720
culture club and what this is is every month a max fun producer or max fun host someone that

01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:41.040
works with max fun is going to pick some form of media maybe it's an album or a movie or a book

01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:46.160
something that means a lot to them and you're going to get sent that along with a note as to

01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:51.600
why they picked it so it's like everybody is enjoying the same media that month binding you

01:08:51.600 --> 01:08:57.440
all together cosmically then at two hundred dollars a month which listen i realize two hundred

01:08:57.440 --> 01:09:05.200
dollars a month is is a pretty uh not insubstantial sum but it goes a long way to support the artist

01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:10.000
an artist that you love and for two hundred dollars a month you get all that stuff plus

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:17.280
free registration to max fun con 2018 and max fun con is the fucking best thing of the year we love

01:09:17.280 --> 01:09:23.200
going to it it's like summer camp for cool kids it's the best and you're going to be registered

01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:30.800
to do that in 2018 because you're a 200 a month donor um whatever whatever level you can support

01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:37.360
us at like we we appreciate you so much and we do take this money and uh we invest some of it back

01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:42.480
into the show and buy new equipment and and stuff like that but mostly like the support we've gotten

01:09:42.480 --> 01:09:46.000
from our network is the reason why we've been able to like we started out it was just my bin

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:50.080
bam on the max fun network and then we started doing adventure zone um i started doing rose

01:09:50.080 --> 01:09:55.040
buddies travis started doing uh shmanners and trends like these and a bunch of bunch of other

01:09:55.040 --> 01:09:59.280
podcasts justin started doing saw bones like we've expanded and been able to do all that stuff

01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:03.040
because of the support that we've gotten from y'all because we can treat this like a job we can

01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:07.840
treat this like a career um and and we're just so grateful that we've been given the opportunity

01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:14.400
to make all this fun stuff because of the support that y'all give us now before we wrap up and i

01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:19.120
know we're heading towards wrap up i do want to just read a question we don't have to even discuss

01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:31.920
all right please please an exterminator just came to my apartment he was throwing little blue things

01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:36.720
under my kitchen counter and i asked what they were he said that they were calcium packets because

01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:41.840
when mice eat calcium it goes straight to their hearts and they have a little mouse heart attack

01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:49.040
his words why does it go straight to their heart because quote mice have no bones just a skeleton

01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:56.720
end quote my exterminator said mice have no bones just a skeleton and then proceeded to explain

01:10:56.720 --> 01:11:03.440
that rats have an exoskeleton he did this while spraying my home with chemicals am i good and

01:11:03.440 --> 01:11:12.320
