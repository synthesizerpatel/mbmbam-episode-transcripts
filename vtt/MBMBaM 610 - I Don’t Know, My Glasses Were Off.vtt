00:00.000 --> 00:04.820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

00:05.760 --> 00:10.580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

00:11.480 --> 00:17.660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

02:07.100 --> 02:08.340
I don't know if you ever

02:08.340 --> 02:14.020
If you ever heard about that it's also kind of like the one thing we do for a living on a regular basis

02:14.020 --> 02:19.340
It's make the voice sound like something else. Yeah, I mean, I don't know I I I just want everybody at home to know

02:19.340 --> 02:20.940
I'm not sad

02:20.940 --> 02:28.560
Cuz I ate I ate so many fucking acai super berries this morning, and it's got did you hear me laugh? Yeah?

02:28.560 --> 02:33.740
Yeah, that was better. I like that intentional or did it just slip out it just came out cuz I was thinking about all the delicious

02:33.740 --> 02:40.640
Big and juicy acai berries that stained my fingers when I ate him like a naughty boy in grandma's garden

02:42.300 --> 02:47.080
And so I do feel I feel so I feel good and strong and powerful and energetic and

02:47.740 --> 02:50.460
That so look, but go I have layers

02:51.500 --> 02:55.420
Behind my behind the sad the obvious sad behind blue eyes

02:56.260 --> 03:02.940
Did you guys hear about what James Cromwell did I did actually I don't know

03:02.940 --> 03:06.060
I don't I don't know James Cromwell from Madden, okay?

03:06.980 --> 03:11.940
He's the farmer from babe, but he's the farmer from babe and other things

03:11.940 --> 03:18.860
Oh, all right from babe, and he did that'll do I think he was probably in Star Trek, and he's in secession

03:18.860 --> 03:24.580
Oh, he was definitely in Star Trek. He was the he invented the war the warp drive for crying out loud

03:24.940 --> 03:29.060
But that's not really what's important Griffin. I want to tell you about what James Cromwell did

03:29.060 --> 03:31.060
Uh-huh

03:31.340 --> 03:34.700
James Cromwell got himself in a little bit of a sticky situation

03:37.400 --> 03:42.460
Cuz what happened Griff is that James Cromwell popular old man James Cromwell

03:43.140 --> 03:47.560
Superglued himself to the counter of a Starbucks in New York. Yes. Yes

03:48.860 --> 03:50.860
Which part of himself?

03:50.860 --> 03:54.140
And he superglued his hands to the counter

03:55.940 --> 03:58.780
To protest the fact that they up charge for vegan milk

03:59.980 --> 04:01.980
All right

04:03.020 --> 04:06.020
Can you imagine you're just trying to get through your day

04:06.700 --> 04:13.980
You see the farmer from babe, and he's like check this out. I'm a sticky bandit. Yeah, he loses his hands

04:14.660 --> 04:19.380
To the counter, and that's your day, but it feels like I could get I

04:19.380 --> 04:23.300
could hand my credit card to the cashier and receive my

04:24.060 --> 04:25.100
expensive

04:25.100 --> 04:26.820
You know

04:26.820 --> 04:28.660
oat milk latte

04:28.660 --> 04:36.180
Like around James Cromwell, do you know I mean like he's got gaps like we could go through the armpit or between the legs

04:36.340 --> 04:40.220
Like there's a lot of ways to get coffee past Jim Jim Cromwell. I feel like

04:43.380 --> 04:45.380
Could you hand me the

04:45.380 --> 04:47.380
Oh

04:47.580 --> 04:51.260
This story stick in your mouth for a second, please thank you Jim if you're listening

04:51.260 --> 04:57.300
I understand it is I would say a bad practice because it discourages the ordering of the vegan option

04:57.300 --> 05:01.480
And it's unfair to people who can't have you know that would do I get it

05:01.480 --> 05:04.860
I get the environment to yeah for sure I like Jim

05:04.980 --> 05:10.060
But you know it's not the person behind the counter who sets the prices right here

05:10.060 --> 05:16.820
You know that right Jim Jim that person with a trendy haircut and like a dyed hair

05:16.820 --> 05:20.020
That's not the color that appears in nature Travis

05:20.620 --> 05:26.020
He was not protesting that morning that his cough his personal

05:27.260 --> 05:29.060
superglue in his pocket

05:29.060 --> 05:31.820
And he was like how much for a bit fuck that yeah

05:31.820 --> 05:37.140
But he actually he actually loudly announced several times don't get it twisted. I have 70 cents

05:37.140 --> 05:40.780
I mean the only person he's inconvenient like yes

05:40.780 --> 05:42.980
That's gonna make its way up the chain to mr.

05:42.980 --> 05:48.900
Coffee who's kind of an asshole about it or whatever but that person the person he's inconveniencing is the person who's just like

05:49.220 --> 05:55.500
Listen, man. I'm just counting down until my break. Please please Jim. I need these tips Jim, please

05:56.460 --> 06:03.180
Um yeah, what's your all's favorite way to sort of sneak a coffee past James and sticky James Cromwell like

06:03.580 --> 06:05.460
under the right arm

06:05.460 --> 06:09.820
Under the right arm, and then I'd like to stick my arm in there and pretend like it. I'm James Cromwell

06:11.820 --> 06:14.140
I'm gonna scratch my nose

06:14.140 --> 06:16.900
I would do like a high-five with his free hand and

06:17.300 --> 06:24.240
Then when his arm was up like he has made a defensive sort of gap in the in his in his sticky armor

06:24.240 --> 06:27.500
And I would definitely get one past him did he just do one hand I?

06:28.460 --> 06:31.380
Guess he would have to well no no he did both hands

06:31.380 --> 06:36.940
I think how did he get out of this how do you get out of this it says that he used a knife?

06:36.940 --> 06:42.180
Oh, no, yeah, yeah nail polish remover will take care of that Jim

06:42.180 --> 06:48.980
I mean if he if you bring nail polish remover to your superglue protest

06:48.980 --> 06:51.660
You're basically saying like I'm not really committed

06:51.660 --> 06:57.740
I like a minute, but I will also say if he did both hands then someone else had to wield the knife

06:57.740 --> 07:02.180
At actor James Cromwell use his mouth use his fucking mouth

07:03.020 --> 07:10.660
Finally they had Sir Paul McCartney write a letter to this former CEO of Starbucks to ask that they would eliminate the extra vegan

07:11.540 --> 07:18.580
Milk fee yeah, because they did that in the UK and so he's probably like all right check it out. It's good. Yeah

07:19.740 --> 07:25.060
Well won't you strike McCartney or James Cromwell strike it down of it over there

07:25.060 --> 07:31.100
And then this that was that was Sir Paul McCartney speaking to former CEO Kevin Johnson

07:31.100 --> 07:34.940
Which I guess he was like can you please ask the real CEO?

07:35.540 --> 07:40.900
To stop doing it that way. It's me Sir Paul McCartney. I'm not sure how business works

07:40.900 --> 07:44.500
Are you his dad is that it, but if you would tell him?

07:45.220 --> 07:47.900
Okay, so I watch the video. He did glue one hand

07:47.900 --> 07:55.500
Oh, that's how like just so he did have one hand free. Yeah give thumbs up to local tourists or whatever do you think?

07:55.500 --> 07:59.140
He did that first hand and the people behind the counter like waited

07:59.340 --> 08:03.540
Expectantly for him to do the second hand too, and then when they didn't he was like oh, oh

08:04.540 --> 08:06.540
Okay, I guess I just okay

08:06.700 --> 08:10.420
And the heartbreaking thing is this is an autograph in hand that he glued down

08:10.420 --> 08:14.340
So he couldn't even like you know spend some face time with the with the fans

08:14.340 --> 08:19.760
That was anyone can draft an email to former CEO Kevin Johnson

08:20.020 --> 08:24.300
But Sir Paul McCartney's never gonna glue his hand to the counter of an American Starbucks

08:24.300 --> 08:30.480
I think that they I I like to imagine that they had to talk him down to gluing his hand to the counter like

08:32.660 --> 08:39.820
I'm gonna go to Starbucks, and I'm gonna blow myself up like well no James Jim Jim. That's too far. He's like okay

08:39.820 --> 08:45.100
Well, I'm just gonna cut my legs off like now. I don't think so. Okay. I'll cut my hands off. No Jim

08:45.100 --> 08:50.700
I don't want that either. Can I super glue both my hands to the counter getting closer warmer?

08:50.900 --> 08:54.300
Just I'm gonna super glue my testicles to the count

08:54.860 --> 09:00.340
We told you a thousand times. You can't do that if you want to do that at home. That's your thing

09:00.340 --> 09:06.300
Just what the one hand I'll just glue one hand to the counter. I was can't why would you do one finger Jim listen?

09:06.300 --> 09:13.780
I'm drawing the line at one hand principles if I attempted this which I fucking wouldn't but if I attempted this I

09:14.260 --> 09:18.900
Could I be crazy became a thing Griffin? I would love it. This is the new

09:20.900 --> 09:23.500
Starbucks the glue yourself to a Starbucks challenge

09:24.900 --> 09:29.180
From the creators of punch your teacher comes the glue yourself to the star

09:29.180 --> 09:34.700
I feel like if I I could go on I could not eat or drink for a day

09:34.700 --> 09:40.900
I could fast for a day and then slap my sticky hand down on that counter and within I'd say two seconds

09:40.900 --> 09:45.660
I my brain would immediately go. Hey piss sounds pretty good right about now, doesn't it?

09:47.500 --> 09:49.380
Brain I literally

09:49.380 --> 09:54.660
Pissed right before I pissed and then I put the super glue on my hand and then I slapped it down and my brain

09:54.660 --> 09:57.340
Yeah, I know but oh, yeah. Did you get it all out?

09:57.340 --> 10:02.660
It doesn't feel like I had to go to the the you know politics corner

10:02.660 --> 10:04.660
across from Baskin-Robbins

10:05.500 --> 10:11.500
Happens on a day. Yeah, definitely. I went with Sid to like do the honking waves thing with cars drive by she asked me

10:11.500 --> 10:13.180
I was like, wait a minute

10:13.180 --> 10:14.980
You want me to stand?

10:14.980 --> 10:19.980
For one hour in a unbathroomed locale just like standing there

10:19.980 --> 10:24.740
So I couldn't leave to go use the bathroom at home if I wanted to write so one full hour and damned

10:24.740 --> 10:30.580
It's the first car honks. I didn't have to like immediately use the bathroom. Like I have to be right now. It's it's urgent

10:30.580 --> 10:36.300
Yeah, you're a great husband Justin. Thank you for making that sacrifice. That means a lot. I'm sure means a lot to your wife

10:36.300 --> 10:43.440
I just pissed pants. Yeah. Oh, well that actually I think makes you let me check the chart a slightly worse husband

10:43.440 --> 10:49.280
Oh, no, but I but in the but in the Cromwell power rankings, you've moved up there

10:49.540 --> 10:54.660
Yeah, you're still out there, but you moved up for the sacrifice, but then you moved slightly down

10:54.660 --> 11:00.260
So a net positive you crumbed extremely well. Yeah, you crumbed hard

11:01.620 --> 11:06.720
My name that's what he has when he reaches his next level crumb heart. Yeah, when you use a moonstone on it

11:09.060 --> 11:11.060
Then he's Jim crumb hard

11:11.420 --> 11:14.180
You sticky slap crumb hard crumb hard

11:15.060 --> 11:20.780
Crumb hard use something. Oh, that's not what I thought sticky slap was crumb hard. Don't ever do that move again

11:20.780 --> 11:24.180
Delete that move put in quick attack. That's suck crumb hard

11:25.420 --> 11:27.060
I'm going to

11:27.060 --> 11:32.300
Do rail us from this comedy gold for a moment just to say thank you to everybody because I didn't get to say this last

11:32.300 --> 11:35.360
Week who became a new upgrading or boosting member?

11:35.740 --> 11:40.420
And also in case you missed it cuz man there I don't know if you guys are gonna believe this

11:40.420 --> 11:45.580
But there's some lucky few who are not on the social media. Yeah, we had to do a lot of dumb shit

11:46.580 --> 11:48.580
Because you guys were very supportive

11:48.580 --> 11:56.260
That included let's see macro mix-up or my brother my brother and me remix whatever we called it where we did

11:56.820 --> 11:58.460
Redid an episode

11:58.460 --> 12:03.260
In the 300s, I think of my brother my brother and me and we switched parts

12:03.580 --> 12:09.880
So I was just it was Griffin Griffin was Travis. It was silly. The drive is over. We don't have to sell

12:11.620 --> 12:15.540
I'm just letting people know that it's there in case they didn't see it on social media

12:15.540 --> 12:22.220
But also we had to get each other haunted dolls. Oh, yeah, I'm not arrived yet. So are you sure I got it

12:22.220 --> 12:24.500
I got a delivered notification Griffin

12:25.820 --> 12:31.180
I did I think yours when I come to me cuz I have to I had mine sent to me

12:31.380 --> 12:35.940
Cuz I didn't know if we would actually get to the goal or not. So now I ship it back. So you have mine

12:36.060 --> 12:39.740
Yeah, I have yours. Oh wait, so oh right. I sent mine to Justin, right?

12:39.740 --> 12:45.880
Okay, I'll ship yours out griff cool Justin. Do you have yours? Cuz I already unboxed neutral Roberta sad spirit

12:47.340 --> 12:54.060
Spirit I do want to say I have seen pics of the dolls and I I got this one for you

12:55.660 --> 12:59.100
I definitely I have it Trav, but I have been waiting for

13:00.140 --> 13:04.380
Like cuz you did an unboxing video. I've been waiting for like a good muscle day, you know

13:04.380 --> 13:12.200
Yeah, like it's today a good muscle day act. Yeah a day where I look not having done anything but like I

13:12.740 --> 13:15.260
Just happened to look jacked and swole. Oh, yeah

13:15.260 --> 13:15.700
Yeah, yeah

13:15.700 --> 13:21.740
Like maybe you drank a lot of water the day before you retained all of it and all of it somehow went right to my muscles

13:21.740 --> 13:27.380
Yeah, yeah for like a really strong muscle day. Well, I actually mean neutral Roberta have really been hitting it off

13:27.700 --> 13:31.740
She liked black coffee and gardening. Yeah, so I give her a little bit

13:31.740 --> 13:37.580
Coffee every day. Have you heard the night yelling? Yeah, no, because I think I've been keeping her in a pretty good mood

13:38.980 --> 13:44.220
So she hasn't been sad. I think that we're getting well it has nothing to do with her emotional

13:44.980 --> 13:50.780
State it's like when she when she fills up with spectral energy

13:50.780 --> 13:55.700
She lets it out by yelling really really loud when the moon and stars are out

13:56.300 --> 13:58.760
okay, yeah, so it's like it's less like a

13:58.760 --> 14:04.600
Feared yelling and more of like a you know steam escaping a kettle. Oh

14:05.320 --> 14:06.320
Okay

14:06.320 --> 14:10.340
You're gonna love it though. You're gonna really like the way it feels I guarantee it now

14:10.340 --> 14:16.760
I have noticed in the listing it says unexplained sounds and movement, but I also have two dogs and a five-year-old and a two-year-old

14:16.760 --> 14:18.360
So it's always hard to tell

14:18.360 --> 14:23.840
Which of those is moving at any time? Yeah, just assume it's neutral Roberta. Uh-huh. Okay

14:23.840 --> 14:29.760
Now it also says and I love this that a lot of the information about her

14:30.680 --> 14:36.240
Comes to the seller via smoke work. That's like hell. Yeah. Okay. Yeah

14:36.800 --> 14:40.600
No, she does vape tricks for sure. Yeah, I love that

14:41.120 --> 14:46.840
Well, we're gonna have these things in our rooms where you can see them and they can see us for one calendar year

14:46.960 --> 14:51.960
So I can't wait to see how we really settle into the space. I am I am I will say this

14:51.960 --> 14:57.200
Uh a little confused and Justin you're a bit more of a hundred doll expert. So maybe you can explain this to me

14:57.760 --> 15:04.840
This line Roberta is a good spirit. I put the neutral label as she has a very sad disposition

15:05.280 --> 15:08.000
If you had a sad friend who is good all the time

15:08.000 --> 15:14.560
I think it would be positive is it that her sad disposition brings her spirit down to neutral because that's a bummer

15:14.920 --> 15:19.840
It's cuz it's all garbage. Oh, okay. Great. Yeah. I don't want to punch

15:19.840 --> 15:26.640
Down or up or sideways, but the thing is about it is it's all nonsense. I think at this point

15:26.640 --> 15:31.360
They're mostly generated by AI. This is my current theory that there's a that there's a robot

15:31.360 --> 15:34.480
it wouldn't be hard by the way to make a robot that just like

15:35.240 --> 15:36.960
buys

15:36.960 --> 15:38.680
untended

15:38.680 --> 15:44.120
Shipping containers full of disused dolls all individually generates all drop shipper

15:44.800 --> 15:46.000
Yeah

15:46.000 --> 15:50.920
Bezos drones are bringing haunted dolls one last thing I'll say about neutral bird is a real

15:50.920 --> 15:55.240
I'm just gonna say a real steal a real bargain cuz she came with her own chair

15:55.520 --> 16:00.520
So I got a hundred eyes and her own chair now the chair if you watch the unboxing

16:00.720 --> 16:04.180
Came with I'm gonna say about an inch and a half long spike on it

16:04.360 --> 16:07.280
Then I think you're supposed to jam her butt down on to keep her in place

16:07.280 --> 16:13.560
I removed that spike and I'm hoping that will help with her sad disposition. It will certainly keep her more

16:13.560 --> 16:15.560
neutral

16:16.200 --> 16:20.440
Yes, if someone said hey for the rest of a training you're trapped in this doll

16:20.440 --> 16:25.080
I'd be like, ah bummer and also also you'll be impaled ass-wise

16:26.160 --> 16:31.600
I would not be wild about that scenario remain neutral though while while this happens

16:32.080 --> 16:35.120

16:35.120 --> 16:38.840

16:38.840 --> 16:44.440

16:45.200 --> 16:48.360
I'm in a thrift shop checking out some cassette tape decks

16:48.360 --> 16:53.580
I hit a jacked on one and there happens to be a recording tape in it with no markings on it

16:53.580 --> 16:57.840
I am dying to hear what is on the cassette, but I'm not interested in buying the deck

16:57.840 --> 17:00.060
Is it stealing if I just take the tape?

17:00.740 --> 17:06.400
Technically the tape is not for sale, right? That's from copping cassettes in Colorado. Hmm. Hmm

17:06.400 --> 17:09.480
Well, you take a you take a thing without paying for it

17:09.480 --> 17:14.320

18:56.480 --> 18:58.720
Of a tape deck at a thrift shop. Oh

19:00.840 --> 19:04.520
I'd say it's a package deal if it's in there. That's part of it, right?

19:04.520 --> 19:09.320
You wouldn't find a deck of cards at a thrift shop and say well, I can just take the ace of hearts, right?

19:09.520 --> 19:11.520
It's in there. It's in the package

19:13.200 --> 19:16.720

Because this is a painting of McLemore owns. Hey, anyways, this tapes probably haunted. I gotta go. Bye

20:15.440 --> 20:19.080
I can't believe that we had a McLemore on the show. We didn't ask him about

Like any of his other works?

20:21.800 --> 20:27.600
Did his other saw the one song that he did that was supposed to heal the world. Yeah that number. Yeah

Oh, there was also the time that he said like a great white shark on shark week, and that was pretty good

20:35.360 --> 20:39.980
I like that one. Yeah, so we've actually reached I've reached the McLemore

20:40.940 --> 20:46.480
Horizon, right? Oh, no. Yeah, I don't want mess up way to talk about our cousin. You want to talk about a McAless?

20:47.040 --> 20:49.040

20:52.400 --> 20:59.400
The wizard sent sent us in this one by actually oh the wizard sent it. No art sent approach me

21:00.160 --> 21:04.500
This is the lowest art Senate and thank you are it's the lowest score. I've seen this one has a

21:04.500 --> 21:12.020
50 percent rating. I didn't realize there were ratings. There are there are and I'm sorry, that's the lowest you've ever seen 50%

21:12.540 --> 21:17.260
Yeah, so holy shit. It's got 43 co-authors Wow

21:19.300 --> 21:23.540
Takes a village if one of them voted a hundred percent on it

21:23.540 --> 21:26.540
It would definitely be higher than this right who's not pulling their weight

21:28.860 --> 21:32.120
Yeah, I don't I I there's no credits on it

21:32.120 --> 21:35.500
So I can't say but it is how to use chocolate to spice up your relationship

21:35.500 --> 21:41.180
Oh, yeah, chocolate and romance are often considered to go hand-in-hand in the love department. In fact offering

21:41.180 --> 21:46.720
I'm sorry Griffin one one quick note. Yeah, did you say love again with a couple more O's in it?

21:52.220 --> 21:58.180
Department in fact offering a box of delectable fine chocolates on Valentine's Day to your lover is a common standard

21:58.180 --> 22:03.820
Standard historically considered to be an aphrodisiac inciting passion and attraction. Do you already know what it is?

22:03.820 --> 22:09.720
Yeah, so let's get a cow and you get rock-hard. Yeah, the cacao makes you turgid. So

22:12.300 --> 22:15.060
Turgid enough to hold up a syrupy pancake. Yeah

22:16.180 --> 22:20.460
He is gonna know you don't have to be careful too much chocolate will turn it fully into a pancake

22:20.820 --> 22:27.140
You gotta be so careful starts if you get to turgid spreads out left to right and you are gonna hate that the way that feels

22:27.140 --> 22:28.620
Yeah

22:28.620 --> 22:33.180
So it's first step out of what is just all of them are so good

22:33.180 --> 22:36.020
But the first one is conduct a sexy chocolate treasure hunt

22:36.500 --> 22:37.280
Huh?

22:37.280 --> 22:42.260
Choose a child choose a time when the kids are with friends and create a steamy game of chocolate hide-and-go-seek

22:42.660 --> 22:44.660
Don't tell your signal about I

22:45.700 --> 22:53.120
Mean it does it's just implied right is in my butt it is if they're the instant the map you had all the clues with

22:53.120 --> 22:57.060
The milk milk lemonade turn around for just me you had everything you needed to solve the case

22:57.700 --> 23:02.260
Don't tell your significant other just allude to an evening of intimacy and to quote be ready

23:02.900 --> 23:05.940
Okay. Okay. Okay. How do you allude?

23:06.580 --> 23:14.380
To a sexy chocolate treasure hunt without explicitly saying that in a way that's that is not concerning

23:15.340 --> 23:20.480
Yeah, I mean if anyone tell if if my wife tells me hey, just so you know

23:20.480 --> 23:25.400
It's gonna get steamy tonight. Be ready. Be ready

23:25.400 --> 23:31.480
I don't like that actually gives me less information. Yeah, and if she just had told me nothing

23:31.640 --> 23:34.600
Yeah, like that's gonna send me into a bit of a bit of a panic

23:35.320 --> 23:40.180
Just get just say you're gonna be looking for some clues. What did you do?

23:40.800 --> 23:46.760
I just don't worry about a there's some stuff hidden around what it what did you do?

23:46.760 --> 23:48.800
The friends are with the kids be ready

23:48.800 --> 23:50.800
create

23:50.880 --> 23:57.880
Purchase a large box of pre-wrapped chocolates preferably your partner's favorites created either a trail of chocolate pieces and rose petals

23:58.120 --> 24:03.560
Leading to the boudoir or devise an interactive treasure hunt. I got dogs. I can't do that

24:04.120 --> 24:07.480
Yeah, that's a really excellent point. Well, the dogs are with friends, too

24:07.480 --> 24:13.040
And with dog friends or with people friends watching them it couldn't matter less their dog

24:13.040 --> 24:14.760
It does matter if there were dog friends

24:14.760 --> 24:20.360
They're gonna get up to shenanigans and chasing alley cats and knock over trash cans for treasure hunt clues

24:20.360 --> 24:24.040
We've both humor and romance into the text such as

24:24.360 --> 24:29.240
Find your next treat in the place where I take my evening seat a favorite bathroom

24:29.440 --> 24:31.200
No a favorite a favorite sofa

24:31.200 --> 24:32.480
That's a toilet for sure

24:32.480 --> 24:36.880
And then leave a small clue with each piece of chocolate until the hunt culminates either in the bedroom or a cozy area of your home

24:36.880 --> 24:43.500
Where you have arranged for a romantic dinner for two and then can't stress enough to and I can't believe they didn't include this the instructions

24:43.500 --> 24:50.280
Turn the air conditioning way up because you do not want to like hide chocolate like in the couch on like a 90-degree day or some

24:50.280 --> 24:55.840
Shit, yeah, I hope you fucking ruined the count. What had like and this is all goop in my head

24:55.840 --> 24:57.040
What have you done?

24:57.040 --> 25:01.920
The end of the chocolate treasure hunt could involve you smothered in chocolate or at least with chocolates

25:06.480 --> 25:09.880
Waffle house hash brown, baby. What how did he die? Well

25:10.880 --> 25:12.600
smothered and covered

25:12.600 --> 25:17.680
So now we're looking at step two, which is make a playlist of music featuring chocolate

25:19.760 --> 25:24.280

Simple search using the term chocolate on music programs such as iTunes will reward you with numerous tracks based on chocolate or chocolate themes

25:49.960 --> 25:56.040
Can I jump back a second to say that individually pre-wrapped chocolates to make a trail is a lot of work

25:56.040 --> 26:01.840
I think a lot of litter. Yeah a much more I would say direct and easy to accomplish thing

26:01.840 --> 26:03.840
Just grab like a bottle of chocolate syrup

26:04.200 --> 26:09.720
Start at one point and just like squeeze it into a line. Yeah create a trail

26:09.720 --> 26:14.560
That's a much clearer slippery fun trail and then you just walk and you lick lick it off the ground

26:14.560 --> 26:15.120
Yeah

26:15.120 --> 26:18.040
Like like a dog like a sick dog take a bath in chocolate

Skip squeezing the Hershey's syrup in the tub and do a chocolate bath the right way

26:22.280 --> 26:24.960
While the internet is loaded with plenty of chocolate bath recipes

26:24.960 --> 26:28.560

26:32.760 --> 26:39.480
So wait, is it literally just first of all the amount of chocolate syrup one would have to buy to fill a

26:40.240 --> 26:41.440
Bathtub well, no

26:41.440 --> 26:46.840
I think it's I think it's saying that you fill it with water and then you sort of like make it a hot cocoa

26:47.280 --> 26:48.880
situation

26:48.880 --> 26:53.800
Gross, I mean we've all seen that scene where Augustus gloop goes up the tube and you're like god

26:53.800 --> 26:55.800
I wish that was me getting school

26:56.080 --> 26:57.800

26:57.800 --> 27:05.240
Incorrect. That's the worst. Yeah, it's a weird white kind of weird milky looking chocolate gross

27:05.600 --> 27:11.520
That was not he was not drunk that that large boy was not drowned in white chocolate, you know that no

27:11.520 --> 27:16.960
It wasn't white chocolate, but it was like a pale tan. It was not like so it was it's rough

27:16.960 --> 27:20.360
Yeah, they I don't think that they could figure out how to make it look right

27:20.360 --> 27:23.960
and so yeah, I came up with some bullshit about like, oh, yeah, this is a

27:23.960 --> 27:25.960
On

27:26.840 --> 27:33.640
Unhomogenized chocolate or something. It's rad. It's crazy. Yeah, it looks like fucking muddy river water. It does not look like chocolate

27:34.200 --> 27:34.680
Yeah

27:34.680 --> 27:41.160
I mean of all the ways to drown that that child who made the mistake of wanting to eat chocolate during his tour of the chocolate

27:41.160 --> 27:46.920
Factory we're in a room where everything was edible or my edible. Yeah, which he was condemned to death

27:47.480 --> 27:49.740

27:49.740 --> 27:53.860
like he was and then he ate and then they were like now you get drought and

27:54.380 --> 27:57.500
He was saying a whimsical song and he was the first one to go

27:57.780 --> 28:03.900
Yeah, not not like the kid who like or the kid who like went into a room is like I want to test out this

28:03.900 --> 28:05.900
Cool technology. I'm a fucking child

28:07.540 --> 28:10.880
Technology can put me on TV. Yeah, I want to do it

28:11.140 --> 28:14.020
Anyway, have chocolate on the menu for breakfast lunch or dinner

28:14.580 --> 28:18.940
You're gonna be pretty sick of it some examples beef stew with chocolate

28:18.940 --> 28:24.380
Well, I guess not a white night teeny which I guess has white chocolate in it

28:24.380 --> 28:30.860
I mean you could do like a mole which would be that would be nice. Chris Kohler's got a real nice recipe for

28:31.780 --> 28:33.780
Japanese curry that has chocolate

28:35.260 --> 28:37.940
It's actually really good try body painting with chocolate

28:40.260 --> 28:42.260
Yeah, I mean that sounds good to me too

28:42.260 --> 28:49.780
I found a recipe by the way for chocolate milk bath. If you want to do that, you dust dump a cup of powdered milk

28:50.340 --> 28:57.260
Tablespoons of cocoa powder and a tablespoon of cornstarch. Yeah a tub and then you just do that. Yeah

28:57.260 --> 29:01.020
Can't be enough. I love taking a bath where I have to take another bath

29:01.500 --> 29:05.980
Right after like I have to get directly the shower and clean on vomit

29:06.260 --> 29:11.420
And then clean the shower because you've left a big a big brown mess everywhere in it

29:11.420 --> 29:13.420
I'm the thing about

29:13.580 --> 29:15.580
sticky-brow foam

29:15.580 --> 29:23.080
Think about the the chocolate body painting is if you're the type of like partners that would be into chocolate body painting

29:23.100 --> 29:26.980
You've already done it without wiki how having to tell you to do it

29:27.100 --> 29:32.860
So if you're doing it off of wiki house thing, there's no way it's not weird. There's no way

29:32.860 --> 29:36.700
There's not a moment. I was like and I guess I'm gonna put it on your nipple

29:36.700 --> 29:41.260
I think I'll put it here on your butt. Is this doing it for you?

29:41.260 --> 29:44.540
The recipe they provided is as follows 17 and a half ounces of dark chocolate

29:45.100 --> 29:51.580
13 and a half ounces of cream a handful of chopped mint leaves one finely chopped chili pepper and a double shot of espresso

29:51.940 --> 29:58.980
That's going to taste bad and feel bad on your body. Is that for the bath? I'm putting a chili pepper. No, this is body paint

29:58.980 --> 30:05.780
This is body paint. No, thank you. A little bit of a tingle. Paint my balls with mint and pepper and espresso. I am

30:05.780 --> 30:12.260
So awake, let me wait. Let me get real sweaty first and open up my pores. Go for it. Yeah, perfect

30:12.340 --> 30:15.700

Chocolate between the two of you gross that that's you know, that's the most phonetically pleasing sentence

31:10.980 --> 31:17.400
I think in the English language is seal the giving with a French kiss involving passing an exquisite chocolate between the two of you

31:17.460 --> 31:20.100
Try so do you want to you want to trade gum?

31:20.180 --> 31:25.220
We could do that too if you want to you can deal with any candy. It doesn't have to just be chocolate

31:25.220 --> 31:26.780
and I also just

31:26.780 --> 31:27.780
Yeah

31:27.780 --> 31:33.700
Not like rule number one like advice number one on this should be like before like the most important thing

31:33.980 --> 31:37.680
Be so careful not to get into an argument when you have all this plans

31:37.980 --> 31:39.540
because can you imagine

31:39.540 --> 31:47.000
You made up all this body paint and like you filled the tub with chocolate and you like ordered dick-shaped French exclusive chocolate and then like

31:47.000 --> 31:51.580
You get into a fight about like whose turn it was to like into the dishwasher or whatever and you're like, okay fine, whatever

31:51.580 --> 31:56.620
Also, like I hate your I hate I hate your mom. Finally you said it

31:57.260 --> 32:01.340
We're so still we can't do that. We're too sticky to do this right and I can't leave

32:01.340 --> 32:06.780
I can't storm out of the apartment right now our showers covered in fucking chocolate. I have no way to be like

32:07.300 --> 32:11.420
Wolves outside or something. I don't know man. We live in the woods in this scenario

32:11.900 --> 32:16.260
The last one is visit a chocolate spa, which is certainly something everyone has

32:16.260 --> 32:18.780
I just want to end this with the community QA it has

32:18.780 --> 32:23.820
a one question and the question is why would you do this?

32:27.300 --> 32:32.020
Community answer says if you both really like chocolate this could be a fun way to enjoy yourselves if it's not for you turn

32:32.020 --> 32:34.020
The page Wow

32:34.380 --> 32:36.380
That's

32:39.260 --> 32:45.340
Anyway, that's how to enjoy chocolate with your lover or how to waste a bunch of chocolate with you're both really gross

32:45.480 --> 32:47.480
Yeah, I think so, too

32:47.480 --> 32:48.560
um

32:48.560 --> 32:53.520

38:12.520 --> 38:16.760
Did your neighbor back into your car bring that case to judge Judy

38:17.080 --> 38:21.160
Think the mailman might be the real father give that one to judge Mattis

38:21.160 --> 38:28.280
But does your mom want you to flush her ashes down the toilet at Disney World when she passes away?

38:28.280 --> 38:33.800
Now that's my jurisdiction. Welcome to the court of judge John Hodgman where the people are real

38:33.800 --> 38:37.080
The disputes are real and the stakes are often unusual

38:37.320 --> 38:42.120
If I got arrested for dumping your ashes in the jungle cruise, it would be an honor

38:42.120 --> 38:44.680
I don't want to be part of somebody getting a super yacht

38:44.680 --> 38:47.080
I don't know at what point you want to go into that business

38:47.080 --> 38:51.880
But we've had a worm bin before available for you right now at Maximumfun.org

38:51.880 --> 38:58.440
Judge John Hodgman the court of last resort when your wife won't stop pretending to be a cat and knocking the clean laundry over

39:01.480 --> 39:05.800
How about another question I would want that I'm a 32 year old woman nice

39:06.840 --> 39:12.600
And well, no, it's a question. Oh, I'm a 32 year old woman who's forgotten how to socialize in this new world

39:12.600 --> 39:18.120
So I was letting my hairstylist whom I have never seen before work away and focus in silence

39:18.120 --> 39:23.320
I was quite relaxed with her hands in my hair the white noise of the salon hair dryers the ASMR

39:23.800 --> 39:28.120
Crinkling of foils in my hair. Yeah, suddenly I wake up to her asking me. Did you just fall asleep?

39:28.120 --> 39:31.160
I said, yes, I'm so sorry. She acts like it was no big deal

39:31.160 --> 39:35.480
But I'm obviously embarrassed that I'm a grown woman who just fell asleep in the middle of a busy public place

39:35.480 --> 39:38.520
Like some kind of toddler. I don't know. I had my glasses on

39:38.520 --> 39:43.000
I fell asleep in the middle of a busy public place like some kind of toddler. I don't know. I had my glasses off

39:43.880 --> 39:48.680
Wait, how long? I don't think I understand that sentence. I don't know. I had my glasses off

39:48.680 --> 39:51.160
Oh, you're not a glasses wearer Justin glasses

39:51.400 --> 39:57.240
The removal glasses is often an indication to your body that it's sleep time. Yeah. Oh, okay

39:57.400 --> 40:01.000
It's like a okay got it. I have my glasses off. I was comfy

40:01.000 --> 40:08.680
She didn't mention it again, but continued to work in silence. I stayed very awake for the rest of the hair appointment

40:08.840 --> 40:11.480
Can I show my face here again? She did a good job in my hair

40:11.720 --> 40:15.560
I don't think a sign would help that you can't just cut us off with the knees like that

40:15.640 --> 40:20.840
You don't know terribly tired in texas a sign would help of like a cute cherub going

40:21.880 --> 40:25.160
I'm sweeping that would help I think

40:25.960 --> 40:27.960
Hey things are rough

40:27.960 --> 40:33.640
Out there and basically nobody's getting enough sleep. Yeah. Yes, if

40:34.520 --> 40:37.080
If somewhat obviously this is a different example

40:37.160 --> 40:43.640
But if I know that people fall asleep to our podcast and that is a great honor because that is I would I loved the idea

40:43.640 --> 40:44.760
of being

40:44.760 --> 40:49.800
You know this podcast morpheus. That's why I try to be as boring as possible and not funny

40:50.440 --> 40:53.480
I have a podcast for people to fall asleep to about cereal

40:53.480 --> 40:59.160
It's called the empty bowl intentional like yeah, that one wants it too much. It's desperate for it. Yeah

40:59.560 --> 41:03.960
Um and getting hey check this out getting your haircut feels good as fuck

41:04.440 --> 41:08.440
Like especially when they do the when they do the the rinsy stuff the rinsing

41:09.000 --> 41:13.480
Um that feels really good and I can fully understand falling asleep during that

41:13.560 --> 41:17.800
I don't think you have anything to feel apologetic for. I don't think this is a situation that

41:18.280 --> 41:21.240
They were embarrassed or they should be embarrassed by it all

41:21.240 --> 41:25.800
I also think there's two different ways for the hairstylist to ask the question. Did they say?

41:26.360 --> 41:32.760
Did you just fall asleep or did they say? Yeah, did you just fall asleep? Yeah. Yeah. I bet it was the latter

41:33.160 --> 41:35.160
there's a big difference like

41:35.400 --> 41:37.080
honestly, like

41:37.080 --> 41:39.720
Why did they ask I think it's weird for them to ask

41:40.280 --> 41:42.680
They usually just like let it let it slide, right?

41:42.760 --> 41:47.320
Like did you just fall asleep if I fall asleep while my wife is telling me something

41:47.320 --> 41:53.080
She would never ask, you know if I just fell asleep, right, you know, which is accepts that i'm

41:53.880 --> 41:55.880
Uh a bad person, you know, yeah

41:57.220 --> 42:01.400
Absolutely, maybe the hairstylist asked because for them it's a point of pride

42:01.960 --> 42:07.560
Like I did such a good job that like I the person felt very comfortable with me and they fell asleep

42:08.040 --> 42:13.320
And that's like did you fall asleep? Yes, and they like reach over and they add a little tally mark to the wall

42:13.320 --> 42:17.960
I did it. I did it plus the sooner like the faster you fall asleep that gives them

42:18.440 --> 42:21.480
Like an early chance to eat the hair off the yeah off the floor

42:21.560 --> 42:27.240
Like they don't even have to wait for you to leave like they can have a little sample of it right here

42:27.720 --> 42:29.560
They can taste the hair

42:29.560 --> 42:32.200
Early to see how much they want to cut off exactly

42:32.520 --> 42:34.200
Well, you got to figure out if it's ripe or not

42:34.200 --> 42:36.920
You know what I mean? Because some of the hair still needs time on the vine

42:36.920 --> 42:43.800
Um, they might they might finish the shampooing and be like, hey, I actually usually don't do it this order

42:43.800 --> 42:47.640
But I am going to cut some more of that of your yummy locks off. I mean

42:48.280 --> 42:50.280
Your long your gross long hair

42:51.160 --> 42:57.080
That's a good question. Do you think it's is it better to eat the hair before the shampoo when it has all of its natural

42:57.160 --> 42:58.680
oils and vitamins

42:58.680 --> 43:05.720
Or after the shampoo when you can maybe flavor it and you know do some infusion asking me but like

43:05.720 --> 43:09.480
I it depends on are we working with

43:10.360 --> 43:15.640
You know on natural herbal essences shit that is going to make it taste like delicious, you know

43:15.780 --> 43:22.200
Cucumber melon or are we talking about some pantene pro v that's going to taste like i'm eating up a lab

43:22.820 --> 43:26.600
Chemicals I have noticed that a lot of times when I get shampooed there's like a mint

43:26.980 --> 43:31.480
Quality to the the shampoo and now i'm thinking that maybe my hair was dessert

43:32.520 --> 43:34.200
Oh, that's possible

43:34.200 --> 43:36.200
um, okay, so

43:37.000 --> 43:39.240
That's I mean we've talked a lot about eating here

43:40.200 --> 43:43.640
Do we want to do another question or has somebody in fast food done something silly just

43:44.840 --> 43:46.840
What?

43:54.760 --> 43:56.760
Oh, I want to munch oh boy

43:59.400 --> 44:01.400
I want to munch

44:01.400 --> 44:06.760
I don't I don't like you can do it. Can you please do the same? Oh squad

44:08.280 --> 44:10.520
Thank you, you had to complete the ritual

44:11.640 --> 44:18.920
Only by you saying squalled am I able to take control of your brother's body and send him temporarily to hell

44:19.240 --> 44:25.800

44:25.960 --> 44:27.960

44:27.960 --> 44:33.400

44:34.360 --> 44:40.040
Well, not wikipedia. It's the fandom.com wiki for my brother my brother and me

44:40.760 --> 44:44.840

45:30.860 --> 45:32.220
Oh, that's sweet

45:32.220 --> 45:38.560
I approach donuts aesthetically and could eat them but prefer not to because of my gluten intolerance

45:39.740 --> 45:46.460
Great. I do need to drink blood to survive. However, I only steal the blood types. Nobody wants like the

45:46.460 --> 45:53.260
D. Great. So I just wanted to briefly thank whoever updates my

45:53.980 --> 45:58.860
Wiki page because I I don't need the reminder about my own life, of course. Yeah

45:59.420 --> 46:02.140
But other people it helps me approximately. Yeah

46:02.780 --> 46:04.760
But no more

46:04.760 --> 46:06.700
self-congratulatory

46:06.700 --> 46:12.140
Nonsense, i've come to talk to you about donuts with my favorite

Oh

46:28.700 --> 46:30.700
To be a treat now

46:31.020 --> 46:37.260

46:38.220 --> 46:40.220
Well, yeah

46:40.300 --> 46:42.700
No, I mean it's like bee milk

46:42.700 --> 46:44.700
G

46:45.100 --> 46:47.100
It's is it the

46:47.900 --> 46:51.580
Yeah, that's a better way of thinking. Yeah, that's a good travis. Just go with it. Yeah, that's about it

46:52.780 --> 46:57.980
Yeah, there you go. Yeah, that's what they call it. That's my favorite joke. Have you seen the jerry seinfeld movie?

46:59.180 --> 47:01.180
I come to watch movies what?

47:02.060 --> 47:08.300
Like getting carsick just sitting in place and watching a movie in a movie theater you get carsick watching a movie

47:08.540 --> 47:10.540
Are you doing like the xd?

47:10.540 --> 47:14.060
Movie theater, where are you watching movies? Wait?

47:15.100 --> 47:20.940
The only movies i've seen are in the back of justin's buick his big beautiful buick

47:21.100 --> 47:25.340
right, he sometimes shows episode of loud house back there is that uh,

47:25.980 --> 47:28.620
Movie sometimes justin just sound clear

47:29.500 --> 47:30.220
Count on it

47:30.220 --> 47:35.740
Sometimes justin puts on an episode of loud house and then goes back in the back of his own buick to watch it

47:35.740 --> 47:40.940
While you are behind his back while he drives. How does that work? You're in his body

47:41.980 --> 47:43.980
not all the time

47:44.060 --> 47:48.540
It gets cramped, especially after he eats a lot of long john silvers

47:48.540 --> 47:51.180
I can't stay you don't have to be in his body

47:51.420 --> 47:56.060
You choose to go in his body and send him to hell the beats walking baby. It's a cool body

47:57.100 --> 47:59.100
honey's beaches moving on

47:59.100 --> 48:05.820
One crispy cream will have taste buds buzzing. Okay, and fans swarming

48:06.460 --> 48:08.780
This month with its first ever sweet

48:09.340 --> 48:11.260
and sensational

48:11.260 --> 48:17.020
Honey donuts. I don't like the idea of donut fans swarming. There's something about that. It's horrifying

48:17.580 --> 48:19.020
crispy creams

48:19.020 --> 48:20.060
Oh

48:20.060 --> 48:22.060
honey collection

48:22.140 --> 48:25.900
It's available for a limited time beginning may 9th

48:25.900 --> 48:28.460
There's three different ones. Okay

48:29.340 --> 48:34.140
A honey pull apart donut, which is glazed light and airy

48:34.620 --> 48:37.580
Whenever someone advertises something being airy

48:38.200 --> 48:40.780
Remember that that is air that you have bought

48:41.880 --> 48:43.880
advertising ripping you off

48:44.540 --> 48:46.540
You want thick and chewy?

48:46.620 --> 48:50.780
Honey donut clusters drizzled with salted honey icing, huh?

48:50.780 --> 48:57.660
A honey bee donut, which is an original glaze dipped in yellow icing and decorated with black butter cream

48:58.220 --> 49:00.220
And then finished. Wait, is there honey in that one?

49:02.380 --> 49:04.380
Just looks like a big okay. Oh, okay

49:05.180 --> 49:12.380
And then a honey cake donut a glazed sour cream cake donut drizzled with honey icing and finished with an oat crisp

49:12.940 --> 49:16.620
That sounds okay. Hell actually countdown. Can I just say crispy cream?

49:16.620 --> 49:21.900
I'm gonna say I see through the thin veneer here two of these were ideas

49:22.380 --> 49:23.020
Yes

49:23.020 --> 49:29.420
Airy veneer two of these were ideas you had and you didn't want to just put out a two donut collection

49:29.980 --> 49:34.780
So you said okay. Yeah, we'll do the pull apart one. Oh and this one. Oh, yeah, the sound cream with that

49:35.100 --> 49:37.100
Oh, we need a third

49:37.340 --> 49:39.980
Make one look like a bee like a fat bee

49:41.180 --> 49:44.380
Um, he's adorable by the way, it looks nothing like a bee. It's amazing

49:44.380 --> 49:50.300
I don't know why they've done this. What are they here? Look at this. Look at this donut. What are they trying to?

49:50.380 --> 49:53.100
Oh count donut. This is a picture of justin bieber again

49:53.740 --> 49:56.780
No, i've deleted that from slack. I don't want to go to jail

49:57.260 --> 50:04.220
Uh, yeah, that's not a that's a circle with stripes and some circle with stripes and vanilla wafer wings

50:05.020 --> 50:07.980
Uh anyway, where was I? Oh, yes, you love bees, right?

50:09.020 --> 50:10.300
bee

50:10.300 --> 50:17.660
Because crispy cream loves honey and the small but mighty workforce that produces it. This is bees

50:18.780 --> 50:20.780
the honey lovers does and will come with

50:21.420 --> 50:26.540
bee friendly wild flower and seed paper for fans to plant

50:27.100 --> 50:29.100
while supplies last

50:29.260 --> 50:31.260
thinking and feeding the bees

50:31.260 --> 50:39.920
Yes, crispy cream will also plant flower gardens at select shops to create more bee friendly environments

50:39.980 --> 50:41.980
Thank god that thank you

50:44.460 --> 50:47.100
It is it does make you wonder though why

50:47.820 --> 50:50.940
Crispy cream decided to leave their stores barren

50:52.040 --> 50:58.940
Undecorated and it was only to delight the bees that they have festooned them in such a way. I also don't love

50:58.940 --> 51:06.700
Of getting a chore with my donuts, you know, i'm not going to have an active day. I just bought 12 donuts

51:08.220 --> 51:10.220
I'm staying at home. Oh

51:11.260 --> 51:14.060

51:15.180 --> 51:21.900

So that's what's going on with bees right now

53:13.500 --> 53:18.700
Yeah, you can save them by eating donuts and then throwing paper on the ground

53:18.700 --> 53:23.520

You can balance out your carbon footprint by driving an hour and a half a round trip to get those donuts by then planting
