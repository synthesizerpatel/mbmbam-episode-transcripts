WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

00:05.760 --> 00:10.580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

00:11.480 --> 00:17.660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

00:17.660 --> 00:30.660
What's up, you cool, baby?

00:47.940 --> 00:49.940
It's better it's better

00:53.980 --> 00:55.980
It's better it's better

01:00.260 --> 01:02.260
Better it's better

01:10.420 --> 01:16.220
Hello and welcome to my brother my brother and me an advice show for the modern era me

01:16.220 --> 01:21.660
I'm your oldest brother just McElroy. Oh this guy over here. I'm in the middle. It's brother Travis McElroy

01:21.660 --> 01:28.500
I gotta take my socks off. Whoa, I can't can't sleep in socks. Can't do podcasts in socks. It's Griffin McElroy

01:28.500 --> 01:30.500
You know Griffin I do that, too

01:30.900 --> 01:32.620
yeah, and

01:32.620 --> 01:37.460
Sometimes I only make it through one song as I'm like recording take off one song and then I'm out in the house

01:37.460 --> 01:42.920
That's my wife. My wife is like, where's your other socks? I'm like, I don't know baby. We all have these

01:42.920 --> 01:49.200
Ceremonies, don't we? We all we all have these rituals. Don't we to make don't we?

01:49.760 --> 01:52.800
Being ants marching, you know, yeah

01:57.920 --> 02:03.440
Doolin days, baby. Oh shit. We didn't do that before. Sorry. One of our rituals is that we do sing

02:05.960 --> 02:07.960
We call it Doolin Dave's

02:07.960 --> 02:14.000
Yeah, we accidentally did it on stage one time. We had to pay mr. Matthews in his outfit

02:15.280 --> 02:17.280
$50,000. Yeah

02:17.360 --> 02:24.160
Hey guy, can I just say normally we talk before the show about what our introduction is gonna be but I don't even think

02:24.560 --> 02:26.240
that we

02:26.240 --> 02:28.240
That we need to do that this

02:28.440 --> 02:34.680
Because there has been such knit. Well, I will say this because it we didn't talk about it. We are recording so this

02:34.680 --> 02:36.680
Decision

02:37.040 --> 02:40.520
So we might as well lean into it no, do you guys realize

02:41.360 --> 02:48.600
that within a week-long span we the hosts of my brother my brother and me are getting a

02:50.440 --> 02:58.560
Quantum leap reboot. Yeah, sure and the Santa Claus reboot both of those franchise ones an announcement ones are released

02:58.560 --> 03:05.400
Both in one week. Are you kidding me over here? Our cup runneth o'er. What do you want us to talk about the fact that you're

03:05.880 --> 03:09.840
Making more quantum leap that may or may not have a gushy presence

03:11.080 --> 03:16.800
Well, it'll be there Justin it might be an undercurrent it might be implied gushing

03:16.800 --> 03:19.520
I mean, I'll say this if I'm watching

03:20.200 --> 03:23.280
If I'm watching yeah, he's very deeply in love with that

03:23.280 --> 03:29.440
but if I'm watching quantum leap Mondays on NBC, you know, there's gonna be a

03:29.960 --> 03:31.960
gushy presence

03:32.840 --> 03:36.640
Know what I'm saying your your wife Rachel is a corner bleep

03:37.240 --> 03:41.520
Abacula fan a freak for her did her reaction

03:41.520 --> 03:47.320
Is there any way her reaction could to hearing about the reboot could have lived up to your expectations?

03:47.320 --> 03:53.320
For the thrill that she would experience is having the quantum leap project back in full operation

03:53.320 --> 03:58.160
I think we have yet to watch it. She is I think suspended in a state of terror

03:59.640 --> 04:04.920
That it won't it won't hit you know that it won't that it won't be gushy enough

04:05.040 --> 04:10.880
Then it won't be gushy enough or maybe they'll mess up the legacy like so they bring up. Dr. Sam Beck and he's like

04:10.880 --> 04:12.880
I actually he was in prison

04:12.880 --> 04:20.880
Yeah, entire life for him. Yeah, and he's a monster. What if what if they combined the two?

04:20.880 --> 04:25.880
What if they're in a shared universe and at one point the quantum leap shows?

04:25.880 --> 04:30.120
I mean, I hope so that would be wild if two different people figured that out

04:30.160 --> 04:37.640
No, Justin the new leapist leaps into the Santa Claus the leper. Yeah. Thank you. The leopard jumps into

04:37.640 --> 04:43.040
The body of the Santa Claus. That's funny. And he's so he's like beating

04:43.640 --> 04:49.720
The shit out of Martin shorts Jack Frost and then he like wakes up and he's just killed

04:50.320 --> 04:55.940
What he must think is the real Martin short and then yeah, and then he's like whoopsie

04:55.960 --> 04:58.440
Which is the new thing is in the reboot

04:58.920 --> 05:06.200
And then you get the if that theme song if that theme song is not just a soaring

05:06.200 --> 05:10.520
ba ba ba ba ba da da da scab skiddy doo then

05:11.120 --> 05:19.000
There's the then there's God is dead and that's what I'll say about that's all that's my only thing that I'll say about it

05:24.560 --> 05:28.780
Let's talk about Santa Claus's though, cuz I think we've held off long enough

05:28.780 --> 05:34.820
That was a good discussion of quantum leap, but I think everybody here wants to talk about the Santa Claus's coming to Disney

05:34.820 --> 05:41.040
Plus, it is a series. There's so much meat on the bone. It could be contained in one episode

05:45.040 --> 05:52.000
So this this show yeah show of the Santa Claus's is about like a

05:53.120 --> 05:59.960
Santa is talking in the trailer for this. We see him talking to Peyton Manning about becoming Santa Claus

05:59.960 --> 06:06.960
but what he means is like a game designer he meets like a game designer who comes up to the North Pole with his family and

06:06.960 --> 06:07.960
I think he

06:07.960 --> 06:10.640
So he's he and now he's looking for a replacement

06:11.000 --> 06:15.880
So like I know I know what the Santa Claus is about

06:17.200 --> 06:21.400
Whoever kills Santa takes over a Santa that's not a goofy came up with for the show

06:21.440 --> 06:26.520
That's what happens in movie is Tim Allen actually kills Santa and then he has to be Santa forever

06:26.520 --> 06:33.620
So Travis if I may what what this show is about is about Santa Claus trying to get Peyton Manning

06:33.720 --> 06:36.140
To be the one that kills it. I think yeah

06:39.600 --> 06:45.040
I'm on I'm on all the Santa Claus forums as you know, and our theory

06:46.320 --> 06:52.240
Yes, what we're talking about is the possibility of he's arranged some kind of like flatlining scenario

06:52.240 --> 06:56.640
Where it's like I will die for a moment medically die

06:56.640 --> 07:01.560
I'll be medically brain-dead and then you're gonna resuscitate me, but the moment will have passed

07:01.560 --> 07:04.480
You'll be the Santa Claus and I'll be free to go back to being a shithead

07:05.160 --> 07:10.360
Shithead Scott Calvin free from this horrible morality curse that I was given

07:10.360 --> 07:15.240
I can go back for like voting for Trump and just like loving

07:15.240 --> 07:22.280
Being conservative politics. It doesn't work though. What we get is to Santa's one's a regular Santa

07:22.280 --> 07:27.800
And the other is a demented Santa that can remember hell and that is I don't like that at all

07:27.800 --> 07:33.720
I do like that though. If this show is just I'm guessing it's not Timothy. I'm

07:34.400 --> 07:36.400
Yeah, it is Timothy. Okay, so

07:36.920 --> 07:44.460
They already took Buzz Lightyear away from him Griffin. They're not gonna take Santa to it's got Laura San Giacomo as a Christmas witch

07:44.460 --> 07:46.460
It says here do like that

07:46.920 --> 07:50.280
But oh, I wanted to say a thing go say your thing

07:50.280 --> 07:55.680
I want to hear it Griffin if this show is just Timothy Allen trying to trick Peyton Manning into killing him for

07:56.320 --> 07:58.320
For a 12 episode season

07:58.560 --> 08:05.680
If it's just Peyton Manning starts his car and he turns on the rearview camera and sees Tim Allen just lying behind his car

08:05.680 --> 08:07.680
He's like

08:07.680 --> 08:09.680
Oh

08:12.960 --> 08:17.360
There's so many houses and the presents are so big he stands up

08:17.360 --> 08:19.160
He's like, oh you got me this time Peyton

08:19.160 --> 08:22.640
And then when Peyton pulls out in the driveway Tim Allen tries to throw himself in front of the car

08:22.640 --> 08:25.080
Like you're gonna make me late for football practice

08:25.960 --> 08:27.960
Is it Peyton Manning as himself?

08:27.960 --> 08:39.320
Peyton Manning as himself? Yeah, Peyton Manning as himself and Santa's like, please kill me. That's the only way he can become Santa. That's the only way he can take over.

08:39.320 --> 08:45.640
Here's what Tim here's what Timbo said about this at the D23 Expo. I need money

08:49.320 --> 08:54.840
Hilariously due to the confluence of Buzz Lightyear. I mean they're out of the Buzz Lightyear business

08:54.840 --> 09:01.080
But he can still be Santa. There's a new Buzz Lightyear in town, but Timbo's still I guess that they're they're working it out

09:01.120 --> 09:03.120
Here's the quote from Tim

09:03.640 --> 09:05.560
You people made me

09:05.560 --> 09:08.600
Said Allen we asked where he decided to reprise the character

09:08.800 --> 09:10.800
We thought about this for a long time

09:10.920 --> 09:16.360
The only way I would do this is if they answer some of the background they answer the questions. Yeah

09:17.720 --> 09:23.240
What Tim is saying is like that he adds you guys are gonna dig it. So what he's saying is like

09:23.240 --> 09:30.040
He wants to get into the mythos. That's the only way really dig it into the dirt of Santa

09:30.040 --> 09:34.680
I'll give you some hard examples that are literally from this article among the questions

09:34.680 --> 09:38.040
It will be answered are why mrs. Claus doesn't have a first name

09:38.720 --> 09:41.680
The history of Santa. Hold on. Wait, is that syntax?

09:42.240 --> 09:44.240
Good

09:47.720 --> 09:53.000
The sentence is among the questions that will be answered are why mrs. Claus doesn't have a first. Okay, okay

09:53.000 --> 09:59.120
Okay, the history of Santa and whether there has been any human children at the North Pole

09:59.960 --> 10:06.440
Well, first of all, yes. Yeah, we already know cuz Max we saw in like the first episode episode movie

10:06.440 --> 10:08.800
But also hey, hey

10:09.920 --> 10:14.860
They're episodes to the Santa Claus is a 12 episode series pretty bold

10:15.320 --> 10:21.720
That the Santa Claus which don't get me wrong has already established the murder lineage lore is like, hey

10:21.720 --> 10:28.740
I think we're the ones who should put this in our hands. We've already established it goes Santa to Santa through bloodshed

10:28.960 --> 10:33.560
We're gonna talk about why mrs. Claus doesn't get a first name and you know

10:34.320 --> 10:39.780
Timbo with all of his open-minded progressive values is definitely gonna do a delicate job

10:40.360 --> 10:42.960
Handling why his wife doesn't get a first name

10:42.960 --> 10:51.800
Yeah, he's gonna do he's gonna be fucking funny. I think we're all are we ready? Are we ready? I don't know

10:59.680 --> 11:02.600
The balls in our court, isn't it?

11:02.680 --> 11:08.840
Well, they canceled last man standing because of his conservative values as far as he's concerned, right?

11:08.840 --> 11:16.720
And then Disney was like, you know what? We've actually been a little too progressive lately been getting a lot of good press for that

11:16.840 --> 11:20.720
Let's rope in some of those guys. Let's bring in some of your

11:22.040 --> 11:28.080
Fellows. Oh, you know, they're gonna be deep and and rambunctious these

11:28.680 --> 11:35.160
These Santa grunts. Oh, man now he's Santa grunts the sound he's gonna make or the fans of the Santa Claus

11:35.160 --> 11:39.360
Okay, that's all the that's actually as much as I can gin up

11:41.040 --> 11:42.600
Pretending to

11:42.600 --> 11:47.280
Enjoy, I will just say in closing. Happy David Krumholtz is working. Yeah

11:48.280 --> 11:51.520
Agreed there everyone make David Krumholtz work more

11:53.320 --> 11:58.800
No matter what he says and no matter what the work is just make David Krumholtz work for you

11:58.800 --> 12:06.120
Hey, it's time for nature to start healing itself make David Krumholtz work for you

12:06.760 --> 12:09.080
Too long have you worked for David?

12:10.240 --> 12:12.280
Digging up his movies watching them

12:12.840 --> 12:18.000
Now I have to return the favor David Krumholtz has a van and he's ready to work

12:18.000 --> 12:22.120
I work in IT for a local bank outside of work. I wear hats

12:22.800 --> 12:24.800
baseball caps or snapbacks I

12:24.800 --> 12:29.840
I think of snapbacks as baseball caps, but I'm trying to make this anyway every day

12:29.840 --> 12:32.960
Hats are not not allowed per our corporate dress code

12:32.960 --> 12:35.800
But my boss seems pretty chill and I think as long as I get my work done

12:36.240 --> 12:39.960
She maybe wouldn't care. Can I start wearing a hat to work?

12:39.960 --> 12:45.620
Or is there a way I could test the waters before fully committing that's from uncovered in, Utah County

12:48.720 --> 12:50.720
Can we

12:51.160 --> 12:53.160
Just

12:53.160 --> 12:54.880
Overthrow

12:54.880 --> 12:59.080
This whole thing. Yeah hats. It's time

12:59.800 --> 13:08.120
Right if if we we've been doing this for a while. Yeah, and I like to think of the work as being important

13:11.480 --> 13:16.360
It bums me out that someone has to ask if they could please wear a hat to work

13:16.360 --> 13:23.120
that feels like it's it is your head and unless you I I don't know what unless you're a

13:23.280 --> 13:26.900
Dentist like if I look up at my dentist is wearing like an Ashton Kutcher

13:28.560 --> 13:35.520
Like on Dutch like a Von Dutch Ed Hardy hat or he's wearing like a fedora

13:36.240 --> 13:39.480
I'm gonna say if you're in the medical field keep it

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
bare up there

13:42.040 --> 13:44.040
It literally anything else

13:44.040 --> 13:47.160
No, you're there. That's incorrect. Okay

13:47.160 --> 13:49.880
Let's really put this to the test Griffin if you want to talk about it

13:49.880 --> 13:55.200
If you've got okay, sure you go to me ma's funeral. There's a field director. Thank you so much for coming

13:55.320 --> 14:00.520
Please ignore my federal body inspector hat now. Hold on. Okay, there's a difference

14:00.520 --> 14:06.460
I would say any any any sorry about my hat. I love the Chargers my dad's from San Diego

14:06.460 --> 14:07.160
I got no

14:07.160 --> 14:13.140
But this is a perception thing just I'm not an inherent thing because I think what Griffin saying is if we swung at it

14:13.140 --> 14:16.480
Hard, right? Yes, there would be some

14:17.320 --> 14:20.040
Adjustment period right where you'd be like

14:21.000 --> 14:27.860
But then after let's say two years, maybe it's fine funeral. This is like a really long funeral

14:27.860 --> 14:32.600
Why have I been there for two years? Well, no, some funerals are gonna fall by the wayside

14:33.080 --> 14:36.540
Some funerals you're gonna have to put in the L column at first

14:36.540 --> 14:43.780
Yeah at first that'll be all anybody talks about and then it's like so commonplace for field directors to be wearing baseball caps

14:43.780 --> 14:46.860
Do we have one industry at a time or do we just have to accept that?

14:46.860 --> 14:51.100
There's gonna be a month or two of utter calamity as we all adjust to the new normal

14:52.580 --> 14:54.900
Except except for dentists. No

14:56.540 --> 14:59.900
No, I want the hat put the hair that's what I'm saying

14:59.900 --> 15:06.460
Get it behind you because here's the thing Griffin what you're ignoring and I think everybody who outlaws baseball cash is ignoring is the baseball

15:06.460 --> 15:12.500
Cap as a prop because imagine this the dentist comes in they got their hand on and then they look at you and they're like

15:12.500 --> 15:15.660
All right, turn it backwards. Let's get down to business

15:15.740 --> 15:20.780
Yeah, and you're like, oh fuck this is serious or like the tip of the cap or they like doff it

15:21.460 --> 15:25.380
Can't have a bill if you're Dennis cuz you're gonna they have this big gnarly light

15:25.380 --> 15:29.180
I don't know if you guys been to one but they got a big light and in a minute. Yeah

15:29.180 --> 15:34.620
I've been a little bit right in a minute. I'm gonna need a dentist. I need a dentist to look at my teeth

15:34.620 --> 15:41.540
Um, hey, what's it my dog? Oh, man. Never I my daughter I took with our the dentist recently and Charlie

15:43.620 --> 15:48.860
Had a cavity a man I felt like such a turd cuz it really kids that's on you

15:48.860 --> 15:50.940
Yeah, it's not them. It's not them

15:51.380 --> 15:54.780
I've been using COVID-19 as a reason and I have to go to the dentist

15:54.780 --> 15:58.660
But then like the further we get obviously it's still clear and present danger

15:58.660 --> 16:05.620
But it is it's hard to look at the 19 in that and not go like it's been three years. I should get someone to

16:05.820 --> 16:12.360
Get in there and sort of do some stuff. I love going to the dentist. I love going to the next

16:13.220 --> 16:19.540
Well, let's say that the question about baseball cap. So inevitably we've ended up talking about Travis's feeling on dentist

16:19.540 --> 16:20.620
In fact, you know what?

16:20.620 --> 16:25.180
I might go ahead and use my old older brother veto power to say I don't want to hear your feelings about Dennis

16:25.180 --> 16:30.540
Okay, what do you think? Can I get a quorum? Yeah, we have a quote. Okay, that's fair. That's fair. That's fair. No

16:30.540 --> 16:33.180
Oh bad news. I've just been captivated by curiosity

16:33.700 --> 16:37.300
Travis's feeling on Dennis and when he denied me now, it's all I can think about

16:37.300 --> 16:43.820
I like the professional certainty of this is the cleanest your teeth could possibly be if it were up to me

16:43.820 --> 16:50.580
I go to the dentist once a month because listen, I know myself even when I'm doing my quip two-minute brush every four sides

16:50.580 --> 16:54.580
Don't give them free promotion. There's no way I'm doing as good a job

16:54.580 --> 16:57.620
As someone who professionally studied to make my teeth

16:58.820 --> 17:03.860
You're like god these feel so clean. How was I content a moment ago? How was I content?

17:03.860 --> 17:08.860
There's more space between the teeth somehow. How the fuck did you do that? Anyways? Yeah

17:09.420 --> 17:13.380
I'm just saying Dennis or magicians clip hasn't actually sponsored us in a minute

17:13.380 --> 17:17.120
So if we could actually say more stuff about equip, I'm just saying clip is great

17:17.300 --> 17:21.820
This is a new trick. This is a new technique. I'm working on. Yeah catch more flies with honey

17:21.820 --> 17:23.820
also

17:24.260 --> 17:26.900
Tremendous tremendous start doing the ads first

17:27.540 --> 17:31.660
Yeah, maybe they pay you for a maybe break them off a sample of it

17:31.660 --> 17:35.940
And then if they like the sample they can come have more we had an idea wants to do

17:35.940 --> 17:38.060
well, I had an idea nobody liked it to do a

17:39.020 --> 17:45.020
Jurassic Park Fallen Kingdom sponsored episode and then ask for ask Universal for the money afterwards

17:45.020 --> 17:52.940
I do the episode celebrate it give all the plugs, but then just be like whatever you think is fair. Yeah

17:53.900 --> 17:54.520
You know

17:54.520 --> 17:58.660
I think I think would be a good system the aspect of this question that I think we haven't touched on that

17:58.660 --> 18:02.900
I really want to dive into is how do they ramp up to wearing a hat?

18:03.420 --> 18:10.740
Right. Do they just dive in one day come in wearing a hat and like wait for the boss to say something or is there?

18:10.740 --> 18:13.000
A way to be like, oh that hat

18:13.000 --> 18:18.480
I don't know how that got here. I guess I could put it on wouldn't that be weird something?

18:18.480 --> 18:22.760
Like is there a way to dance around it engage your boss's reaction?

18:22.760 --> 18:28.920
I mean, okay, so you could come in there is an escalation here that we haven't addressed which is

18:30.760 --> 18:36.120
Start with a fascinator little guy and then maybe if it's I mean, it's pretty maybe

18:36.120 --> 18:42.200
Appropriative but like a yarmulke just increase that would be appropriate if Griffin. I don't

18:43.200 --> 18:47.320
Area of the head maybe and then you work your way up to like a toboggan

18:48.480 --> 18:50.480
Or a to beanie what?

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
And then like, you know, maybe

18:54.800 --> 19:01.320
Very good baseball cap, but the bill is only like one inch deep and then you just a real chode of a big

19:01.320 --> 19:08.680
Real showed and then you just expand. Holy shit. Is it okay when we talk about merch?

19:08.960 --> 19:10.960
We usually talk about

19:11.280 --> 19:15.520
Designs that go on merch. We don't talk about bold new

19:16.640 --> 19:18.640
directions in hat technology

19:19.840 --> 19:22.760
innovating I'm talking about a baseball cap a

19:23.160 --> 19:29.360
Chode ball cap, but with just a one inch front brim that just bear it doesn't do anything

19:29.360 --> 19:31.920
but you can wear it as a

19:32.840 --> 19:33.920
transition

19:33.920 --> 19:36.760
Into a full baseball cap lifestyle

19:36.800 --> 19:44.040
there's a person a very good person named Sarah McKay whose job it is to listen to the things we say and then turn them into

19:44.880 --> 19:48.080
Physical objects like she's out of me like outcome. Yes

19:48.080 --> 19:51.320
It's incredible if you've bought anything from us in the past couple years

19:51.320 --> 19:52.440
You have the Sarah McKay thing

19:52.440 --> 19:58.920
I can only imagine the terror in her deep down in her bones hearing us say like in any way

19:58.920 --> 20:04.720
It's a baseball cap with a chode you sort of villain anyway, because in her mind there's a timer

20:04.720 --> 20:08.240
It's like if they talk about this for ten more minutes. It's going to heaven

20:09.240 --> 20:16.320
I hope please God let them get distracted. Okay alternately. Oh, man. I'll come in with a huge. Yes

20:16.880 --> 20:21.080
Huge fucking hat same page same page same page and then they're like you can't wear that

20:21.080 --> 20:23.760
I'm like, well, I have this smaller one I could wear

20:23.760 --> 20:31.040
It just says like it's the words opening offer or printed in like yeah. Yeah, it's not like this is my the beginning of negotiations

20:31.040 --> 20:33.240
This is what I call a turbo sombrero

20:33.240 --> 20:39.760
And if you want if you don't like this because I'm hitting people in the office with it every time I move my head around

20:40.280 --> 20:46.640
Maybe you'd find this more except no, how about this choke? How about this chode ball cap? I do gosh

20:46.640 --> 20:49.200
This is so embarrassing. Well, I do have one thing

20:49.200 --> 20:55.280
I do have one more that you might like one more that you might enjoy you heard this. I have one for you, too

20:55.280 --> 20:57.280
Do you like podcasts?

20:58.240 --> 21:00.280
only chode ball caps have the

21:02.680 --> 21:07.280
Good quality don't get don't get store-brand chode ball caps. Oh

21:08.080 --> 21:11.740
What imagine being a hateful person that just had a regular red hat?

21:12.960 --> 21:14.960
Here's the problem

21:14.960 --> 21:21.600
If we invent the chode ball cap, we're gonna have to invent chode ball. And I don't think maybe that's just baseball

21:21.600 --> 21:23.600
but the bat is

21:26.200 --> 21:28.200
Trey if you're listening the base

21:30.240 --> 21:32.240
I know you guys like the word chode

21:34.920 --> 21:38.720
We have in the last five minutes and guys if you're not sold yet

21:38.720 --> 21:46.180
How's this it you chode balls and now now we've now that's jokes on jokes on jokes. We like it

21:46.180 --> 21:48.180
Hey, how about a wizardly?

21:48.720 --> 21:54.640
Approach to things Chloe sent this one in things like it's it's a wiki how article and

21:55.600 --> 21:57.600
It is how to scat

21:58.160 --> 22:00.000
how to scat

22:00.000 --> 22:03.160
Scatting or scat singing is when you sing not

22:03.160 --> 22:09.040
Scatting no one's ever said scat singing in their entire feel confident enough to say that

22:09.400 --> 22:12.520
No, probably not. It's the ultimate creative

22:13.120 --> 22:19.320
Spontaneous expression for a vocalist allowing them to play on melodies and solos. You can't have in pre-written lyrics. I

22:19.840 --> 22:21.840
Could pre write a scat I bet

22:23.760 --> 22:27.560
Okay, yeah, I'm just saying I could sit down at the typewriter and just be like scoot

22:27.560 --> 22:33.160
Scoot scoot scoot scoot scoot up. I'm gonna start with a scat

22:33.600 --> 22:37.060
Okay, listen to the whole article like and see if we can improve it

22:38.680 --> 22:42.920
Okay, no, no stop I'm gonna stop you already I'm gonna stop you already okay, don't say scooby-dee

22:43.440 --> 22:48.460
Well, no, you just did the intro to I'm the scat man. Okay, okay

22:50.520 --> 22:52.520
Let me try

22:53.960 --> 22:55.720
Okay, so now we're doing

22:55.720 --> 23:00.580
Scat man. Oh, I need something new. Okay, let me try something new and fresh. Okay, okay

23:01.160 --> 23:03.160
scatting

23:04.600 --> 23:06.600
There's a lot of room

23:06.720 --> 23:12.760
I think you did you did get dangerously close to the corn riff again, which boys

23:12.760 --> 23:18.640
I'm pretty sure every episode for the last like five episodes has had a heaping help in a corn

23:19.320 --> 23:23.400
I need to get that on my soundboard. Don't I? Yeah, okay, so

23:23.400 --> 23:25.400
getting used to

23:34.820 --> 23:39.620
Okay getting used to scatting use improvised syllables and sounds to scat over instrumental tracks

23:40.380 --> 23:42.820
That's fun because it does it doesn't even say

23:43.500 --> 23:48.660
You know over over songs. It says instrumental tracks so you could take you know

23:48.660 --> 23:54.180
Yeah, the Moonlight Sonata and just be like scoop scoop scoop

23:54.820 --> 23:59.020
Scoop scoop, dude, if that's where you need to start. You got to start with

24:04.020 --> 24:08.060
I think you guys are saying I think you guys are saying boop like way

24:10.140 --> 24:15.260
Way too much duty that duty that duty daddy duty. No, you're saying duty dad

24:15.260 --> 24:19.420
Do you think duty dad over again? You're right. You're right. You're right

24:20.260 --> 24:26.060
Practice call and response with scat singers and instrumental lines. I like that. Yeah, the problem is they don't always leave room

24:26.700 --> 24:31.780
For a deposit. Yeah, so when so you turn on scat man, and he hits you at that school

24:32.780 --> 24:34.780
and then you pause it you're like

24:35.260 --> 24:42.820
There's no fucking way. No, it's just he was so fast. There is no way it's what they're saying like you should

24:42.820 --> 24:50.140
You should play regular scat records, and then it's just like a fine places to like slip in a little bit

24:50.140 --> 24:53.380
Well, you get that you get those moments in songs where it's like screw

24:55.940 --> 25:01.220
You know what I mean not a lot of songs these days though you might have to look for some older

25:01.580 --> 25:08.300
They're not throwing that a lot in there Harold stylish isn't throwing in a lot of scat breaks which by the way

25:08.300 --> 25:15.740
I don't want to give notes because obviously I'm not a musician but maybe maybe think about it start with simple

25:15.980 --> 25:22.460
rhythmic syllables focusing on melody instead of new sounds as you begin improvising your own scattered line start with a couple of

25:22.660 --> 25:30.020
Accepted in quotes scat words and syllables simple percussive noises are the easiest way to start using sounds like Bob beep

25:30.340 --> 25:34.100
Ski do etc. But remember ski do but

25:34.100 --> 25:40.980
That's really good we're improving remember that you're not gonna say anything you're playing with musical notes

25:40.980 --> 25:42.980
Oh words, okay

25:43.380 --> 25:48.340
The musical scale made famous in the sound of music is a great place to start do re mi fa so la ti do I'm pretty

25:48.340 --> 25:49.500
sure

25:49.500 --> 25:54.980
That existed before sound of music, but I actually don't know I actually are you confident?

25:55.340 --> 25:58.380
Okay, accent modulate and have fun with your syllables

25:58.380 --> 26:04.020
Oh things like change the volume singing like bop bop and then tone like bop

26:05.340 --> 26:07.340
How do you

26:14.860 --> 26:17.340
Perhaps the most important pitch is how high or low your notes

26:17.340 --> 26:22.700
So you said I don't know

26:24.700 --> 26:27.980
No, I'm sorry, I that was my theme song for the show Doug serious

26:30.100 --> 26:33.860
Practice with a metronome or an instrumental track to help you stay on time. That's fun

26:33.860 --> 26:37.780
I worry you could develop some bad habits that way if you do it with a metronome

26:37.780 --> 26:43.580
We're just like ski ski ski ski ski ski ski be but what about when you're in front of an audience

26:43.580 --> 26:50.740
You're like, all right, everybody clap your hands. Nope a little faster. No, two four two four, please two four. Thank you

26:50.740 --> 26:54.940
Yes, good. If you guys want me to scat fast, you got to do it in 16 time

26:55.260 --> 27:01.860
Skip scott scott scott introduce a little okay, so in Corvin that sounded like a like a scatting troll in like a

27:01.860 --> 27:03.860
C&C

27:05.380 --> 27:12.020
Introduce a little rhythmic variety with doublets and triplets is doublets. I've is doublets

27:12.300 --> 27:14.300
That's two of something

27:14.820 --> 27:20.640
Doublets are simply two sounds thrown quickly together. Okay, ah and triplets are three sounds beep-de-bop

27:21.260 --> 27:24.740
Instead of using straight quarter notes where you have one sound per beat one two

27:24.740 --> 27:31.460
Three four start stringing together these other phrases leaving spaces in between them for a bouncy swingy feel. Okay, I under I understand this

27:31.460 --> 27:35.300
So sort of like you would say like goo-goo-gah-gah-gah Griffin. How's it coming with you?

27:35.300 --> 27:39.300
Can we hear I feel like you've been talking so much. We haven't heard much of your psych. Sure

27:43.300 --> 27:50.860
I'm square. Wow. I like the squay at the end. That was good. Yes way is an advanced

27:51.740 --> 27:55.260
I did a master class on that one

27:55.260 --> 28:02.860
Oh with who yeah, who taught it. Yeah, please speak on that scatman crothers. Whoa, you got him

28:03.700 --> 28:07.660
Got a look at his dad quick to see if he's dead gonna do a quick search

28:09.700 --> 28:11.700
He died before I was born

28:13.740 --> 28:15.740
You took a master class with the ghost

28:15.740 --> 28:23.380
Yeah, he was born in 1910 it would be crazy if he was still alive that was one

28:24.740 --> 28:28.180
How did you how did you live so long scatman crothers

28:29.660 --> 28:35.540
Scatting is a young I learned that as long as you whenever you're scatting you're not aging

28:37.540 --> 28:39.540
Just on his death

28:39.540 --> 28:46.040
Oh the angel of death zooms in through the window and he's just like skips got good leap above skips

28:46.040 --> 28:48.540
Go ahead. He's like shit. I can't get him right now

28:55.740 --> 29:01.740
So, uh, oh is that it no, there's there's a little bit more uh, get a little swing behind your scatting

29:01.740 --> 29:06.460
We just did that learn the chord progressions to improvise like a jazz singer. That's too much work. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

29:06.460 --> 29:10.300
Yeah, I'd rather music just change to fit what I'm doing, right?

29:10.540 --> 29:14.980
Scat through your vocal solos to bridge classical singing and scatting. That's cool

29:15.660 --> 29:18.740
so you could be singing like, you know, like

29:20.980 --> 29:22.980
Rolling in the deep

29:23.820 --> 29:29.300
Skip this cop cops keep it up up up. Well, I should have picked a song that I knew more than four words

29:29.300 --> 29:34.300
Yeah, when I started that exercise, that's a very Jason Mraz move and frankly, I'm here for it

29:34.300 --> 29:36.660
I once saw that dude perform live

29:37.580 --> 29:41.980
10-minute one song jazz odyssey. I was incredible. Fuck

29:42.660 --> 29:44.660
underappreciated artists

29:48.780 --> 29:51.740
Mr. A to Z though, he you know when he was playing in the high team

29:51.740 --> 29:57.060
I was directing a children's theater production of Superman. He told the audience ghost a ghosty Superman

29:57.060 --> 30:02.020
I don't know how you really he did. He really he did that. Mr. A to Z. Appreciate you. Thank you, Mr

30:02.020 --> 30:05.140
Z. Let me get a quick Google in here for him

30:06.340 --> 30:08.340
I think he's okay. Yeah

30:10.020 --> 30:14.780
He's alive still definitely yep, which is a good start he alive and

30:16.860 --> 30:21.740
Okay, looking good Jason looking good. Yeah, thank you Jason to the cannon

30:21.740 --> 30:27.580
There's the McElroy brothers temporary stamp of approval. Well, welcome Jason

30:27.580 --> 30:34.780
We are conducting some some more background deep background work. You've joined the pantheon of 13 different people that we have deemed it

30:34.780 --> 30:37.700
Okay to joke about and we should say right now

30:38.460 --> 30:43.980
Recording this episode. It's 10 57 a.m. Eastern Time, Thursday, September 15th

30:44.460 --> 30:48.340
2022 just to hold up the newspaper in front of that statement

30:49.180 --> 30:52.860
Here's some sports scores for events that are happening right now

30:52.860 --> 30:58.700
Get a little weird with tone voice and coloring. That's fine. Yeah, that's it. So I think that that's obvious though

30:58.700 --> 31:03.860
I think it'd be weird to be like, well, I love skiing singing scat, but I like to keep it pretty vanilla

31:03.860 --> 31:08.780
I don't I to mix it up would be I would that would put me out of my comfort zone, frankly

31:09.500 --> 31:15.500
Okay, that makes sense. Yeah. I mean you're a novice at scatting. So who are you to come in and tell everyone?

31:15.500 --> 31:20.180
Hey, you're doing it wrong. Let me go. Let me let me show you how it's how to do it better

31:20.180 --> 31:25.940
Okay, now Justin now that we've had the full thing and you're warmed up. Can we hear where you're at now? Yeah, sure

31:37.940 --> 31:41.940
I thought we were about to do a Hanna doll watch. Yeah, I mean I love your scat. That was good

31:41.940 --> 31:46.460
That was a thematic reference. That was like a thematic. I was trying to like it was clever. It was playful

31:46.460 --> 31:52.700
It was playful, clever, way too many bops, but it's

31:53.140 --> 31:58.540
But you can but it takes you got to extend your vocabulary. Okay, let me try it now

31:58.980 --> 32:00.740
Boo boo bah

32:00.740 --> 32:03.300
Boo boo bah bah bah bah boo boo bah

32:03.940 --> 32:05.940
Boo boo scooty daddly scooty da

32:07.020 --> 32:09.020
They are the gummy bears

32:09.260 --> 32:15.580
You saw the moment where you Travis realized he had been saying booba for like four whole bars

32:15.580 --> 32:19.420
And he was like, I got to say something else and he came in with a scootaly scoot

32:19.420 --> 32:25.900
Hey Travis, it's you aren't you need to keep practicing. I'm only on level two. I'm still singing along with other songs

32:26.220 --> 32:31.860
Yeah, but Justin escalated it during this segment. I don't know. I'm sorry. I'm not as good at Justin. It's scatting Griffin

32:31.860 --> 32:35.260
We've had this conversation you had every opportunity to improve in the same

32:36.860 --> 32:41.180
That was for you to heat like just step-by-step

32:41.180 --> 32:43.180
Step-by-step, yeah

32:44.180 --> 32:46.180
He did that and then I did

32:46.700 --> 32:49.100
Listen, what were you doing? Were you playing video games?

32:49.700 --> 32:55.420
No, I was looking at theme songs from Disney cartoons that I could scat along to I wish you would take anything seriously

32:56.020 --> 32:58.780
Well, that's not how I live my life. I'm kind of like the Patch Adams

33:03.860 --> 33:10.620
Lot of beeps and bops but it's good. It's interesting. It's interesting. I'm worried Justin stuck in scatting now

33:10.620 --> 33:12.620
Let's go the money zone

33:21.260 --> 33:25.420
I want to say thank you a big. Thank you to babble for

33:26.540 --> 33:32.820
Sponsoring our show. They've very prominently listed the languages that they support on this incredible app

33:33.020 --> 33:36.500
Apparently maybe we've made some up in the past. Yep. They don't necessarily do

33:36.500 --> 33:39.780
I don't know why we talked about Klingon so much that one time and I'm really sorry

33:39.780 --> 33:43.140
But let me tell you about the real babble not the pretend one you

33:43.860 --> 33:48.900
Want to learn a language? Maybe it's for work. Maybe it's for fun. Maybe it's a little extra practice at school

33:49.060 --> 33:51.060
Whatever, but maybe it's to win a bet

33:51.500 --> 33:56.700
You need a fun way of doing it or you're not gonna stick with it. And that's where babble comes in

33:56.700 --> 33:59.580
It's a language learning app that sold more than 10

34:00.180 --> 34:05.380
Million subscriptions if you can find 10 minutes a day, you can complete one of their little bite-sized lessons

34:05.380 --> 34:11.620
Start having real conversations in a new language. Isn't it as little as three weeks, which I think is

34:12.460 --> 34:14.460
Pretty impressive. I mean

34:15.420 --> 34:17.500
Say no more with babble

34:17.500 --> 34:22.260
You are going to be learning a new language and you're gonna be doing it in a bite-sized way that fits into your schedule

34:22.260 --> 34:26.620
So you will stick with it and right now you can get up to fifty five percent off your subscription

38:52.320 --> 38:55.120
My name is dr. Sam bet no

38:55.120 --> 39:02.120
I just thinking like wouldn't be cool if he quantum leaped in here. How would he explain he doesn't normally introduce himself like that

39:02.120 --> 39:06.720
I think that would kind of break the concept of the show first. Yeah. Yeah, he leaps in and he's like

39:06.720 --> 39:09.920
I'm not the dude. I want a lunch squad

39:11.280 --> 39:13.920
I want to munch

39:17.560 --> 39:22.840
Welcome to munch squad. It's podcast within a podcast profiling the latest and greatest in brand eating

39:23.160 --> 39:30.680
Y'all got frios gourmet pops around here your area. No Fritos gourmet pop. Sorry. It's very confusing

39:30.680 --> 39:32.680
f r i o s

39:33.160 --> 39:38.720
lowercase F if you okay, that's not like you're saying Fritos, but you're in a terrible hurry

39:40.520 --> 39:42.520
This free Zaxby's

39:43.100 --> 39:46.640
The premium quick-service restaurant beloved for its chicken fingers

39:47.200 --> 39:54.760
Wings and legendary Zax sauce has partnered with Alabama based gourmet popsicle brand frios to introduce

39:54.760 --> 40:01.360
Sauce flavored popsicles. No, Zaxby's sauce sickles will be available for free

40:02.880 --> 40:07.400
I'm assuming they mean on it from a monetary perspective. They will be free not from the hole

40:07.400 --> 40:11.680
It will take on you as to eat just cold sauce

40:12.520 --> 40:15.920
The frozen treat will feature two of the brand's boldest sauces

40:16.600 --> 40:18.600
Zax sauce and tongue torch

40:18.600 --> 40:25.720
Oh you guys want to see him real quick while we're while we're chatting about this give me one sec

40:25.720 --> 40:30.960
I don't know if I actually do. I mean, I guess it's just a popsicle right? How gnarly could it look?

40:31.960 --> 40:36.560
I'm Ben pretty gnarly cuz I just feel like it looks kind of gnarly like

40:39.920 --> 40:45.680
I mean if they didn't say tongue think about Zax sauce though, like what would that think about how much of that?

40:45.680 --> 40:49.040
I don't think I know what Zax sauce is

40:49.160 --> 40:54.120
The Zax sauce flavored sauce sickle features all the sweet tangy and creamy flavors

40:54.360 --> 41:00.160
From the signature blend of spices black pepper and Worcestershire sauce. Oh, that's no I'm good

41:00.160 --> 41:07.280
I'm alright actually without that the tongue torch sauce sickle is a mild heat tomato pop with nuts garlic paprika turmeric and a hint of lime

41:07.280 --> 41:15.640
Zaxby's is renamed the month of September sauce timber, which I don't think you could just do not a portmanteau

41:16.200 --> 41:24.200
I mean listen guys Congress has been getting stuff done lately. And it seems this seems like a worthy federal holiday. Oh

41:25.560 --> 41:29.780
We don't work in September. That's when we think about sauces that we enjoy all day

41:29.780 --> 41:37.780
Uh Zaxby's is celebrating sauce timber, which they made up by treating loyal fan base to this saucy goodness on a stick

41:38.180 --> 41:41.700
The sauce sickles come packs at eight and are limited to one per person

41:42.300 --> 41:49.260
Can I just stop you there trade man and say I don't this place will give you eight free popsicles. That's a lot

41:50.340 --> 41:55.580
The only way that that works is if they tasted the first one and said we can't fucking sell this

41:55.580 --> 42:02.060
We need eight million of these fucking things we give them away

42:02.060 --> 42:07.460
I don't think you can call something that is frozen solid saucy

42:08.060 --> 42:14.140
Right. It is inherently as it no not about that as it melts. Your hand is just covered

42:17.740 --> 42:20.780
The very smell if it gets on your skin

42:20.780 --> 42:25.980
Yeah, like as you're eating it, that's you all day. You can't wash your hands enough

42:26.260 --> 42:27.340
Here's what's up, though

42:27.340 --> 42:33.900
Like if you go they'll be available for free on September 19th online through sauce sickles calm

42:34.460 --> 42:37.020
okay, so if you're like listening to this like

42:37.820 --> 42:42.420
Go get some take a picture. You know what I mean? Like do I don't live near a Zaxby's?

42:42.420 --> 42:47.620
It's kind of a road trip treat for me. Like, you know, good luck. Good luck spelling sauce sickles though

42:47.620 --> 42:52.660
Oh man, go to sauce sickles calm. They're like melting in a puddle. Oh god

42:55.740 --> 42:59.660
It's like a creamy oh god, oh god

43:00.460 --> 43:06.380
I've tried three different spellings of sauce sickles calm and none of them have gotten me there even in this picture

43:06.380 --> 43:08.380
It doesn't say the words

43:08.580 --> 43:14.580
Yeah, now let me tell you how they could have really made something special is if they had called them Zaxby's prank sickles

43:14.580 --> 43:21.820
And then all of a sudden it's a nice the 4th of July BBQ and you have your you know

43:21.820 --> 43:28.760
Nephew Dale Dillip who you fucking hate and you're like enjoy a creamy treat Dillip and but then he gets the spicy

43:30.540 --> 43:36.020
Chicken flavor well, but now you guys talk to his dad Jormie and you and Jormie has never been really close

43:36.420 --> 43:40.980
Yeah, he's one other brief with you all please. This just came across my desk

43:57.420 --> 44:01.340

Accounts like you you are not responsible enough for this. You can't you just spent you just spent

So that is happening in the in the metaverse

45:38.400 --> 45:41.280

45:59.800 --> 46:02.680

They no one's ever revealed a new menu item in the metaverse. It just doesn't it doesn't happen. Hey, um

46:24.280 --> 46:28.040
Can I pull back the curtain a little bit and just be honest for a moment?

46:28.800 --> 46:33.240
Is the metaverse just like the way people are referring to like the Internet now?

46:33.240 --> 46:38.540
How much longer do we have on the it looks like we could go about 10 minutes on this. Do you want to Travis?

46:39.160 --> 46:43.700
Because is the roblox. I thought the metaverse was just what Zuckerberg was doing

46:43.700 --> 46:48.900
Well, how deep does it go? It's it's what's next? It's not funny

46:49.540 --> 46:53.140
This is the one thing I'll say. I mean, it's kind of fun now Griffin. What are you doing?

46:53.140 --> 46:59.160
Are you looking up the metaverse on your phone? I'm on I'm trying to log into roblox, but it's been a while

47:03.940 --> 47:06.640
Can I go into the metaverse and eat the steak

47:06.640 --> 47:14.080
Um, do you have Mark Zuckerberg? That's true. Can we get Joey pants to say like actually the steak of the metaverse is

47:14.440 --> 47:22.120
Delicious. I told you all now. Do you have Mark Zuckerberg special flavor harmonica attachment for the oculus? Yeah

47:22.640 --> 47:26.480
You do it slots right into the bottom and it looks like a regular harmonica

47:26.480 --> 47:28.440
But it's got different flavors inside of it

47:28.440 --> 47:32.320
And then you just suck them out as you like you'll walk toward the giant

47:32.320 --> 47:39.320
burrito in the Chipotle experience and it'll be like suck pepper suck flower and then you get like those flavors in your mouth and it's

47:39.320 --> 47:47.480

49:30.520 --> 49:34.840
Essentially is what we're talking about and in real life as your character rolls out in real life

49:34.840 --> 49:41.720
There's a robot somewhere that you're controlling that's rolling it right so like like in war games and sometimes

49:41.720 --> 49:47.760
They don't even tell the flesh human Chipotle employees that the robots there and so there have been countless

49:48.360 --> 49:51.260
accidents where the robot thinks it's making a

49:51.960 --> 49:54.320
Burrito, but really it's like rolling up

49:54.920 --> 49:58.240
the bones of the poor Chipotle employee

50:00.440 --> 50:02.440
Information the metaverse sucks

50:02.480 --> 50:05.400
By launching garlic guajillo steak in the metaverse

50:05.400 --> 50:12.000
We're able to share our culinary traditions and real more like culinary and real food

50:12.400 --> 50:14.920
Proposition with Gen Z says Chris Brandt

50:15.960 --> 50:17.960
chief market desperate person

50:19.600 --> 50:23.180
Desperate relic through a sheen of sweat

50:24.400 --> 50:26.400
Keep bellows down the halls

50:27.200 --> 50:33.200
For the first time fans can discover our latest menu innovation from our head chef

50:33.200 --> 50:39.340
with an immersive experience that blends the best of Chipotle's digital and physical worlds our

50:40.540 --> 50:42.540
head chef cyber Mike

50:45.460 --> 50:49.300
They don't say that this burrito can't exist in real life

50:49.540 --> 50:56.820
They don't they don't say that that it's structurally impossible to make this burrito with tan with a tangible

50:56.820 --> 51:02.920
Tangible tortilla, it's too heavy the toppings. I will say though you can unlock

51:03.720 --> 51:10.080
Virtual items exclusive virtual items as I have just done which includes Chipotle's iconic chef coat

51:11.100 --> 51:13.100
the nom-nom aura

51:13.380 --> 51:15.380
And a guajillo

51:15.380 --> 51:21.800
Tea yeah, you roll up to adopt me wearing one of those people are gonna give you the respect you need that you deserve

51:21.800 --> 51:30.640
So that is what that's what that's web 3.0 trap should we should we that's what the metaverse is yes

51:32.240 --> 51:38.480
I've recently passed the bar and started working as a business and construction attorney and overall

51:38.480 --> 51:42.100
I'm very grateful for the opportunity that I've had so far my career. Thanks

51:42.640 --> 51:45.720
Constellation counseling Wow, why would they not have more there?

51:47.400 --> 51:49.400
Okay, here it is sorry

51:49.400 --> 51:53.240
However for the past few years my real interests have been in space law

51:54.560 --> 51:56.400
Yes, how can I show the world?

51:56.400 --> 52:03.880
I'm ready to represent the Stars and as a space lawyer, what should my first order of business be that's from Constellation counselor and Carrie

52:05.160 --> 52:08.240
Well, hmm. This definitely has to exist

52:08.240 --> 52:12.520
I don't think we should look it up because there's no doubt in my mind because there has to be laws about like

52:12.680 --> 52:14.680
launching satellites into space

52:14.680 --> 52:21.200
Right and who can have what up there and how much of the moon we own which is all of it the last one

52:21.200 --> 52:25.740
I don't know, but there is there is international satellite law

52:25.960 --> 52:30.600
We got there first and by America standards. I'm not saying it's right or wrong

52:31.160 --> 52:38.240
But we got there first we put a flag on it and historical precedent says that's ours. Yeah. Yeah, that's I mean

52:38.440 --> 52:42.020
Here's here's the thing about space law if you and it's definitely wrong by the way

52:42.020 --> 52:46.920
Well, I just you jump back putting your flag on something and saying it's mine. Definitely wrong. We not do that

52:46.920 --> 52:51.160
We all share the moon. There's a tree. We all share the moon's all of ours the moon's all of ours

52:51.160 --> 52:52.840
Yeah, but it's mostly

52:52.840 --> 52:56.300
But it's mostly my I think of it as a very American celestial body

52:56.300 --> 53:02.020
The thing that sure s did that I think you could model here is if you want to do a space thing

53:02.300 --> 53:06.920
Yeah, there's a little moment of fake it till you make it I think cuz you're not going up there very much

53:06.920 --> 53:10.080
nobody is but we like to act like we are for example a

53:10.080 --> 53:16.520
Little bit ago. I don't know if you heard but the America did the United States Space Force and

53:16.920 --> 53:19.540
Everyone had a very good laugh about that like wow

53:19.540 --> 53:25.640
It's really wild that they want to start a Space Force and we'll have a lot of fun. There's a different guy in charge now and

53:26.840 --> 53:29.240
We kept the Space Force as far as I know

53:29.240 --> 53:32.400
So I guess we all just kind of like yeah, I guess we got a Space Force now

53:32.400 --> 53:38.180
Yeah, it's one of the things that we have is a fleet of guys and gals and people just to defend space

53:38.180 --> 53:43.020
You know, we made them. We made the patches that go on there already did it

53:43.020 --> 53:48.240
There's a space marine we printed out we 3d printed their space marine battle armor

53:48.360 --> 53:53.700
So we can't just throw that away there and I'm not gonna make them like we're not gonna fire them

53:53.700 --> 53:59.380
Then you just got a bunch of angry people trained to battle in space. I don't need that. I see Armageddon

54:00.040 --> 54:05.820
Well now hold on Justin. They started off as drillers who were then trained as

54:05.820 --> 54:11.500
Space people because it's easier to train drillers to be space people

54:11.740 --> 54:17.900
And it is to train space people to drill as that movie establishes now. I will say this

54:18.060 --> 54:23.160
What if you just started on your business cards have it say like, you know Constellation Counselor and Kerry

54:23.700 --> 54:25.940
business and construction attorney comma

54:26.780 --> 54:33.980
preeminent space law expert now at this point interesting because now at this point there may be someone else on earth

54:33.980 --> 54:39.760
Who's like no way? I'm the preeminent space law lawyer or whatever now if that happens

54:39.820 --> 54:42.280
You're gonna have to challenge them to a space law off

54:42.740 --> 54:48.180
Right and you beat them maybe in a Yu-Gi-Oh card battle. I don't know. However, you want to settle it?

54:48.180 --> 54:50.980
I mean Travis every every court

54:51.620 --> 54:57.380
Hearing is a law off if you really want to get technical about anytime people go to court. It's a loss

54:57.380 --> 55:03.740
It's a lot. It's a little laws contest. I guess that's true Griffin. It's all Yu-Gi-Oh battles, but with laws you are correct

55:03.900 --> 55:07.820
That's all the court cases. The evidence is a blue eyes white dragon

55:07.820 --> 55:11.620
There's the the analog works here and off a bunch of different ways. I think we can all agree

55:11.620 --> 55:17.200
It's exactly the same, you know when your lawyer transforms into a more serious version of the original lawyer

55:21.700 --> 55:23.300
Yeah

55:23.300 --> 55:30.300
We know so much about Yu-Gi-Oh, um, hey, hold on to your beans real tight. Okay, I'm gonna freak him. Okay

55:31.340 --> 55:33.340
Isn't all law space law?

55:36.840 --> 55:43.620
Like we're here like we're all in it. Yeah. Hey, do you know what I mean? So yeah, man

55:45.260 --> 55:48.780
Aliens we're aliens. There's a lot of law. There's a lot of

55:48.780 --> 55:54.860
Argument about where space starts right for space law because there's also sky law, right?

55:55.060 --> 55:57.300
but there's a there's obviously some sort of

55:58.020 --> 56:02.300
Permeable barrier there between sky law and space law all the really yes go on

56:03.100 --> 56:05.100
right, but if I if I'm on a

56:05.540 --> 56:10.580
Rocket ship and I kill one of my fellow astronauts at like, you know in the ionosphere

56:10.980 --> 56:14.380
Like whose jurisdiction is that in is there air?

56:14.380 --> 56:17.940
What's that? Is there air then it's sky law?

56:18.540 --> 56:24.820
There's some air but it's then I'm gonna say at that point you're I think space right now is like international waters

56:24.820 --> 56:30.340
I think if you're you get out there you kill someone past the atmosphere. Oh, yeah

56:30.340 --> 56:36.220
So what if we what if every rocket ship has to have a bird on the outside of it launches?

56:36.220 --> 56:38.580
And then as soon as that bird dies

56:38.580 --> 56:44.260
That's space baby. I think that's cuz birds love sky

56:44.260 --> 56:51.180
But they hate space and this may be the only way that we can really tell where one star one as long as we're doing

56:51.180 --> 56:54.420
That Griffin, let's cover our whole basis bird at the front, right?

56:54.420 --> 56:56.220
It's I'm gonna land the animal at the back

56:56.220 --> 57:02.700
So that way we know as soon as it goes from ground law to sky law where it's just like, oh, okay that Fox died

57:03.220 --> 57:07.820
Okay, the fuck I don't know why you picked a Fox, but okay, we'll go on with Fox

57:07.820 --> 57:13.220
I would pause it that Fox and bird would probably die about the same time

57:15.940 --> 57:20.540
Duct-taped them to the outside of a rocket ship as it blasts off. I'm gonna say they're all here

57:20.540 --> 57:27.060
I'll grant you this Travis. There's probably going to be a small margin between Fox death and bird death

57:27.060 --> 57:33.300
And but I think that the lawyers know the Fox is at the very back so that it's touching the ground

57:33.300 --> 57:40.500
Right before you leave, right? Why are we good? Sorry. Why did you take the bird to the rocket?

57:41.060 --> 57:45.340
So, you know when you get into space cuz birds love sky Justin keep up birds love sky

57:46.700 --> 57:55.460
Here's a mnemonic device if birds alive you're in the sky if birds are dead then space ahead

57:55.460 --> 58:01.540
Oh, you're not okay and around space, okay fine

58:01.540 --> 58:07.220
But Travis you don't need the Fox to have its feet on the ground in the same way that if I jump in the air

58:07.220 --> 58:11.060
And shoot someone that's not skycrime. That's

58:12.780 --> 58:18.180
About of distance where the Fox is gonna be like I can still see the ground. It's totally cool

58:18.180 --> 58:22.660
Maybe that's it's when the Fox starts freaking out. You're in sky here in the sky

58:22.660 --> 58:25.620
Yeah, that's as long as the Fox remains calm

58:26.100 --> 58:32.300
Still earth all more. I think that caught the Fox will be fairly upset by being taped to a rocket

58:32.300 --> 58:39.300
I will I know that base level obviously just that's that's your new base level. So you gotta let him acclimate

58:39.340 --> 58:40.140
Yeah

58:40.140 --> 58:46.460
Train chill foxes that don't mind being taped on guys tape them to the rocket a couple head days ahead of time

58:46.460 --> 58:53.980
Yeah, we do is this is we were struggling what we do is we tape baby foxes to the space ships and they grow in captivity

58:54.780 --> 59:01.820
This is natural for them. They love it. And this is we're getting into we're starting to get into ethically choppy waters

59:01.820 --> 59:07.060
So I just want to say right now choppy waters ahead ethically choppy waters ahead

59:07.060 --> 59:16.620
I just want to say right now. These are hero foxes. Oh, see I was gonna go the other way Griffin and say these boxes deserve it

59:17.620 --> 59:21.780
These boxes stole some chickens space is Australia for foxes

59:24.820 --> 59:27.740
We're not even doing it for experiments anymore we're just blasting

59:28.860 --> 59:35.940
Okay, this is definitely a hero bird right because birds love sky every bird wishes they could get this there's so many birds

59:35.940 --> 59:37.940
So many too many

59:39.900 --> 59:48.180
All right, I think we've I think this solves it yeah, yeah the question that was asked which is where does space start yep, you're welcome

59:48.820 --> 59:50.820
Hey

59:51.260 --> 59:56.040
All right, I know you had to acquire that and program it during the show

59:56.040 --> 01:00:04.040
No, that's why you're doing your ad Justin well what I've found is a 50 second bed so we can just and it's

01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:08.700
Isolated it's just that part so it can go for it's chiller than I remember

01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:15.840
Well, it's isolated so you don't have this this the scorching guitars. You don't have Hetty doing his bass riffs

01:00:15.840 --> 01:00:19.000
Oh, hey, can I tell you guys some exciting news, please?

You don't have to know anything about any of the other stuff or anything really or anything

01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:12.020
You just come and enjoy a basic comprehension of the English language would be I think helpful

But we're doing a lot of great body work up there and you may just get a hoot and how by which Justin means we do

01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:18.360
