00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.640 --> 00:47.920
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother my brother made advice show for the modern era.

00:47.920 --> 00:51.360
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle brother, Travis McElroy.

00:51.360 --> 00:55.280
And I'm Craig. I'll be your server this evening. Can I interest you guys in some

00:55.280 --> 01:00.960
magnum shrimp on a crispy toast? Uh actually, Craig, I was looking at the uh

01:00.960 --> 01:06.080
do you do the magnum shrimp on like a grilled or maybe like a ceviche?

01:06.080 --> 01:09.920
We don't. What is that? You're just using words that we've never heard here at the Applebee's.

01:10.880 --> 01:15.680
You never heard the word grilled? We invented the grill. What was the other one? Servicer?

01:18.160 --> 01:22.800
Ceviche? We're here at the Applebee's for Father's Day waiting for Dad to show up

01:22.800 --> 01:28.160
um and also celebrating Justin. This is Justin. Happy Father's Day. Thanks guys.

01:28.160 --> 01:32.080
Wow, what an honor. I'm a dad. You didn't even ask me. You didn't even ask your old pal Craig

01:32.080 --> 01:38.400
about his children. Craig, are you a dad? How many children do you have, Craig? 19.

01:39.920 --> 01:46.800
19 children? Yes. You could have more? Human children? Six of those. Six human children.

01:46.800 --> 01:50.560
What are the other 13? How many are real doll babies? How many of the what's are what's?

01:50.560 --> 01:55.200
How many are real doll babies? Of the of the human children or all of them? It's a complicated

01:55.200 --> 02:00.480
diagram. I hope you're not counting real doll babies. Okay, how many of your human children

02:00.480 --> 02:08.880
are real doll babies? None. Pound puppies? Yes. Wait, hold on. Some of your human babies

02:08.880 --> 02:15.280
are pound puppies. 13 pound puppies, six real doll human babies. You said none of your babies

02:15.280 --> 02:21.120
are real dolls. They're not real dolls. They're CPR test dummies. What can I get you all started

02:21.120 --> 02:27.680
with some appetizers? I would like a jalapeno mudslide, please. That's a happening. I would

02:27.680 --> 02:33.120
like for your voice to not sound like a malfunctioning talk boy. That's my problem. My

02:33.120 --> 02:40.960
brother fed me one at force when I was six. I used a tremendous amount of brother force to get that

02:40.960 --> 02:47.360
talk boy down the throat. The battery's been running out for years. In that case, I'll have

02:47.360 --> 02:51.200
the steak quesadilla towers. I'm gonna need one of y'all to punch me in the throat to start the

02:51.200 --> 02:57.520
rewinding of the tape. Why don't you head on back to the kitchen. I'll rewind the tape and you give

02:57.520 --> 03:02.320
our order. If you see our brother Griffin on the way back from the badmama jamma slamma bamma

03:02.320 --> 03:08.320
bathroom, maybe you could. Oh, I forgot my doggone gear notebook again. So I'm gonna need y'all to

03:08.320 --> 03:12.880
start over with the food and the drinks that you want to take and consume. You know what, I actually

03:12.880 --> 03:18.000
think we're not ready to order yet. We're gonna wait for our dad. That's fair. I'm a dad, y'all

03:18.000 --> 03:21.200
know about that. All right, I'll tell you see talk to y'all later. I'm gonna go hit the drawn.

03:22.240 --> 03:30.320
Hey guys. Oh, hey. Did you see Craig on the way? Uh, no. I did see some sort of swamp thing-esque

03:30.320 --> 03:34.800
monster and it looked like he had a microphone coming out of his throat. Anyway, uh, should I

03:34.800 --> 03:40.640
sit? Where should I sit? Yeah, Griffin, I got you a booster seat. Just pop up right there.

03:40.640 --> 03:47.840
Thanks. You know how little my legs are and how short my butt is. Here I go. You're notoriously

03:47.840 --> 03:51.440
short butted. Hi everybody, I'm Griffin McElroy. I'm the youngest brother. We have a lot of fun

03:51.440 --> 03:55.360
here on the podcast, but today let's talk about something serious. Pennies from heaven. Pennies

03:55.360 --> 03:59.840
from heaven. Who knows? I know where they come from, but where do they go? Today, an expose.

03:59.840 --> 04:04.640
Didn't you guys recently, you went to Guy Fieri restaurant, didn't you? Yes. How does that stack

04:04.640 --> 04:10.720
up compared to this, uh, to this Applebee's? Uh, we haven't eaten this Applebee's yet, but, uh,

04:10.720 --> 04:16.160
I'm going to go ahead and go out on a limb and say that this Applebee's is going to be a 20 star

04:16.160 --> 04:22.720
dining experience comparatively. If I open my day planner and turn it to today, I have not colored

04:22.720 --> 04:28.400
the second half of the day in orange highlighter and just written diarrhea with big block letters

04:28.400 --> 04:35.600
on it. Diarrhea would be a blessing for me right now. I had a crazy Hagar cocktail to drink and

04:35.600 --> 04:41.360
then I had a bacon mac and cheeseburger, uh, for my entree. Uh, and I haven't been pooping those

04:41.360 --> 04:46.000
out as much as they have been sort of bursting from my chest, like a Xenomorph from the alien

04:46.000 --> 04:51.040
films. And, um, when they, when they burst out of my chest, it's, it's Mark McGrath from the band

04:51.040 --> 04:57.120
Sugar Ray. He grows up to turn into Guy Fieri. Well, at least you didn't force like a Tony

04:57.120 --> 05:03.120
award winning Emmy award winning, just all around great guy to go with you. Well, it was his fucking

05:03.120 --> 05:09.600
idea. Remind him of that to the grave. Um, which is tomorrow. Tomorrow is the grave. Thank you for

05:09.600 --> 05:13.120
that Lin-Manuel. Your pooping schedule is so much better than mine. Griffin might've been,

05:13.920 --> 05:17.840
my Guy Fieri meal has been popping out like guest stars on a Jerry Lewis telephone.

05:17.840 --> 05:22.560
Just you never know when it's going. It lasts for two days. You never know when they're somebody

05:22.560 --> 05:25.840
else is going to show up. We've had a lot of fun here twice on my brother, my brother and me,

05:25.840 --> 05:30.960
the episode that we're on now, the number that I don't know. Um, but this is an important public

05:30.960 --> 05:34.240
service announcement. First of all, we're going to get to the bottom of that here in just a bit.

05:34.240 --> 05:42.000
Second of all, don't go to Guy Fieri's place as a joke because the joke's on, it's not even on you

05:42.000 --> 05:44.720
because then that would assume that somebody is getting some form and pleasure out of it.

05:44.720 --> 05:49.840
I assume Mr. Fieri is getting a lot of money out of it, but it's not even funny bad. It's not,

05:49.840 --> 05:57.040
it's not. What I discovered that day is you can't eat ironically. You can't eat things as a goof.

05:57.040 --> 06:02.720
They still go in your human body and stay there. Right. Sure. Um, you also can't eat his pretzel

06:02.720 --> 06:08.400
breaded chicken tendos that you can't. It's a, it's a trick and it's a trap to lure tourists.

06:08.400 --> 06:14.720
Travis, these chicken tendos were so dry. They came with a honey, they were dry as a popcorn fart

06:14.720 --> 06:20.560
and they came with a honey mustard dipping sauce. Griffin was so desperate to get the final, um,

06:21.840 --> 06:27.760
remnants of any sort of moisture, any sort of moisture for the chicken that he actually

06:27.760 --> 06:34.240
knocked the ramekin across the table and onto the floor, uh, because he was trying so hard to get

06:34.240 --> 06:39.520
the last of the dipping sauce out. I was excavating to get that flavor, any juice. Oh, there's gotta be

06:39.520 --> 06:45.840
some juice. I was, I was a, uh, a dousing rod for sweet mustard, but instead of falcon, I falcon

06:45.840 --> 06:50.720
punched a ramekin across a Guy Fieri steakhouse. The worst part about it is as soon as the ramekin

06:50.720 --> 06:56.560
touched the floor, we heard a prerecorded message from Guy Fieri play across the loudspeakers and

06:56.560 --> 07:02.560
he just says, fuck it, play it where it lays. And that's like, apparently anytime you drop food there,

07:02.560 --> 07:08.400
yeah, anytime you drop food there, Guy Fieri says, fuck it, play it where it lays. In the Guy Fieri

07:08.400 --> 07:14.080
restaurant, they had a recording of him saying, fuck it, fuck it, play it where it lays. I can't believe

07:14.080 --> 07:21.680
that's true. I know, it's hard to believe. Fuck that shit. This is Guy Fieri's fuck house. Yeah, and then when you,

07:21.680 --> 07:25.600
when you walk in, there's another prerecorded message and it plays and it says, abandon all

07:25.600 --> 07:32.320
hope ye who enter here. Now, we're, we're, we're having a lot of fun here, my brother, my brother, and me. We've had three funs so far.

07:32.320 --> 07:38.480
This is the same building that had love, peace, and taco grease written, like, on the wall in huge

07:38.480 --> 07:44.000
letters. You know the weirdest thing about it? Wasn't that crowded? Got a table right away. No problemo.

07:44.640 --> 07:49.440
Um, what are we doing? Paint me a picture. What time was it when you entered the restaurant,

07:49.440 --> 07:55.120
were they all, like, sitting around smoking and then they had to, like, oh, oh, hey, oh, hey. I think the

07:55.120 --> 07:59.840
time was the time of my life. Do you guys want to do some advice? When I suggest a meeting time with

07:59.840 --> 08:03.440
my friend and they decline, who bears the responsibility to suggest a different time?

08:04.000 --> 08:09.200
I personally feel obliged to do this if I'm the one vetoing a date, but some of my friends provide

08:09.200 --> 08:13.120
no such follow-up and I end up feeling like a control freak when I push the matter.

08:13.120 --> 08:19.280
Are my expectations unreasonable? That's from Anxious in Alberta. If it is, if it is a spoken

08:19.280 --> 08:26.160
conversation in person and you have both expressed equal amount of interest to do this thing,

08:26.160 --> 08:31.760
now it's a back and forth. You say 5 p.m. They can't do 5 p.m. It's now their thing. If it's a thing

08:31.760 --> 08:37.840
that you desperately want to do that they've, like, agreed to go do with you, it's your job.

08:39.280 --> 08:46.160
See, this is why I don't, I just don't like our measurements of time, how numerical they are.

08:46.160 --> 08:51.760
I just wish we could do it, like, um, they used to do it in the olden days or how they do it, like,

08:51.760 --> 08:59.760
in, like, a chill sort of oceanside town in Greece where it's just, like, sunset. Come by at sunset.

08:59.760 --> 09:03.120
Everyone can get down with that because then it's objective. You got a pretty wide window of time

09:03.120 --> 09:08.080
there that you can show up. Come to the, come to the cafe at sunset. Oh, how nice does that sound?

09:08.080 --> 09:11.920
Oh, but that gives me such, like, panic shivers now if someone's like,

09:11.920 --> 09:18.480
just come by in the afternoon. Uh, is, is, do you mean 1201 or like 430 or?

09:18.480 --> 09:22.160
Afternoon represents, like, a good six hour chunk of time. I don't, I don't like that. Tie it to a

09:22.160 --> 09:29.520
celestial body is what I'm saying. When the, when the, when the polar star above us, um, shines high

09:29.520 --> 09:36.400
in Cerberus's belt, then that is the time that we will go see Jurassic World. Honey, what time are

09:36.400 --> 09:40.560
we supposed to have dinner with the Smiths? I, let me pull out my sextant. Hold on one second.

09:40.560 --> 09:45.360
Let me get out my sextant. It's at cloud noon. What is cloud, what is cloud noon?

09:45.360 --> 09:49.920
That's not real. Yeah, sure. It's when the clouds are at their highest noon. Yes, exactly.

09:51.280 --> 09:56.320
It's in the Poor Richard's Almanac. That's a poor, poor Richard though. He doesn't know what he's

09:56.320 --> 10:00.640
talking about. Yeah, I think it's on you. If you, if you're the one saying like, no, that time doesn't

10:00.640 --> 10:05.120
work for me, I think the ball's in your proverbial cord at that point. I think that you do have to

10:05.120 --> 10:10.960
say like, no, that won't work, but here's this, check this out. I often think that if I suggest

10:10.960 --> 10:15.920
a time and someone's like, no, and they don't offer an alternative, like they don't want to do

10:15.920 --> 10:20.240
it. Yeah, they get left behind. Right? You don't like, you don't, you don't get to come to Arby's

10:20.240 --> 10:26.240
with me. What time do you want to go to Arby's? Like five? No. No. Can I, can I recommend cloud

10:26.240 --> 10:34.160
noon? Working sky gold to cloud noon. The sky's illuminated. Time to get to the office until the

10:34.160 --> 10:44.000
clouds are shaded by the moon's reprieve. Clouds behind the mountains. If you see the sun glistening

10:44.000 --> 10:49.520
all across the fountains. Oh, now, now listen, it's going to be vitally important that there

10:49.520 --> 10:53.680
are fountains everywhere in order for you to make your point. You have to do that. Yeah. It's, it's

10:53.680 --> 10:59.040
hard to, yeah. How about a Yahoo? Yeah. Let me hit you with this Yahoo. Uh, this one was sent in by

10:59.040 --> 11:07.200
Evan Jones Thorn. Thank you Evan Jones Thorn. It's by Yahoo Answers user. Hottie101. H-O-T-I-E 101.

11:07.200 --> 11:16.000
Thank you Hottie101 for your bravery. Hottie101 asks, what is a good sumer gob for teens?

11:17.200 --> 11:25.920
Uh, summer job I think is the translation from this language, which I believe is Swahili. Uh,

11:25.920 --> 11:32.000
what is a good sumer gob for teens? Something that brings in cash, dollars, pretty good business.

11:32.000 --> 11:35.200
These are bullet points by the way. Let's start over from the beginning now that you understand

11:35.200 --> 11:40.560
the context of this list. Something that brings in cash money. So no volunteer work. Pretty good

11:40.560 --> 11:49.200
business. So that one's important. No lemonade field. No lemonade stands though. Those are

11:49.200 --> 11:54.160
illegal. Have you seen these stories? Have you seen stories by the way of like cops shutting down

11:54.160 --> 11:57.520
lemonade stands? Like, like people actually shutting down lemonade stands because like I

11:57.520 --> 12:02.560
guess they're not like licensed or whatever. This doesn't happen. It's really happening in

12:02.560 --> 12:09.360
our America. How old is this teen that they want to bring in good cash money and good business

12:09.920 --> 12:15.520
but lemonade stand would even be on the table in some form or fashion? I don't know Travis,

12:15.520 --> 12:20.240
but I can give you a six-year range. I can, I can say they are definitely between 13 and 19.

12:20.240 --> 12:25.120
For sure. For sure. I hope to God there's not a 19 year old that people are like,

12:25.120 --> 12:30.560
you should start a lemonade stand. No, no, forget that. That would be some good ass lemonade.

12:30.560 --> 12:36.880
I'm not, I'm not interested in like a, a mix where like there's a, a bottom layer of silt

12:36.880 --> 12:41.280
that is just sugar and you don't get to any of that delicious glucose and all you get is

12:41.280 --> 12:47.360
yellow water. No, I want that. I want the steady hand of a 19 year old who's been around the block.

12:47.360 --> 12:51.920
I was picturing like backward E, you know, like made out of like cardboard and like

12:51.920 --> 12:56.320
dowel rod, but maybe it's like a food truck thing. Yeah. If you go to a 19 year old's

12:57.200 --> 13:03.840
lemonade stand, you're going to get some like made with agave nectar, some like cilantro mixed in

13:03.840 --> 13:09.440
there. And maybe there's some tequila in it. Yeah. And they're going to have a selection of apps,

13:09.440 --> 13:14.240
like some sweet potato with like a, some sort of kimchi sauce on top of it. Oh, I thought you

13:14.240 --> 13:22.560
meant like iPhone apps. No. Well, yeah, they have an iPhone app to crush. You get to follow made,

13:22.560 --> 13:28.240
the lemonade truck stand. They just call it nade because it's like a hipper cooler version of

13:28.240 --> 13:32.960
lemonade. And that's the, pretty much the way to do things these days is just to shorten the word

13:32.960 --> 13:38.800
and maybe take one of the vowels out. So it's like n-d and that's n-n-n-d and then maybe like

13:38.800 --> 13:47.200
an umlaut over the a. Yeah. Let's hit. I've been mowing this lawn all day. I've worked,

13:47.200 --> 13:54.480
been working up a hearty sweat. You know, I could really go for some. Maybe a 19 year old could get

13:54.480 --> 14:03.760
an artisanal lawn mowing job. And it's just, they, they clip it all by hand. No machines used. Very

14:03.760 --> 14:10.400
like carbon neutral footprint with plastic safety scissors and free range goats. What if you open

14:10.400 --> 14:16.080
your door after hiring a 19 year old to mow your lawn and you open the door to see them holding

14:16.080 --> 14:22.000
like 20 ropes connected to 20 goats and they just mouth the words, fuck you. And then you had to

14:22.000 --> 14:27.600
give them a thousand dollars. Yeah. And 600 of those dollars are going to a fresh class of,

14:28.720 --> 14:32.560
and at the end of the day you go out, the goats are still there. You bought the goats. Yeah.

14:32.560 --> 14:36.240
They, those live with you now. But now you have an alternative revenue source and those goats are

14:36.240 --> 14:41.360
going to pay you back in full. Oh, goats will pay dividends. Because goats are, goats are good

14:41.360 --> 14:44.800
borrowers. They, they, they pay you back with interest in a very timely manner.

14:46.960 --> 14:52.960
What would be a good teen summer job? Well, okay. Let's, let's give a little bit of background. You

14:52.960 --> 14:57.920
guys tell me your teen summer jobs. What did you guys do when you were teens? I used dog buttholes.

14:57.920 --> 15:03.040
Yeah, Travis had dog buttholes. We've covered that. Super lucrative career. I did mow lawns

15:03.040 --> 15:07.440
for a while. Mowed lawns for a while. I remember you not being very good at it. I remember Dave

15:07.440 --> 15:11.760
read my dear friend Tommy's dad complaining that you did a bad job. Or was that girl? Oh,

15:11.760 --> 15:15.680
that was me. I did not have, I lacked follow through. Yeah, that was me. I was using a push

15:15.680 --> 15:20.160
mower, which, which means like you can't really tell that your lawn's been mowed. It's just sort

15:20.160 --> 15:25.120
of been combed. I did, I did a good job brushing his lawn for him. You were a great lawn flattener.

15:25.120 --> 15:29.920
Yeah. And he would come around and be like, Hey, uh, this sucks. And I'd be like, I know. Money,

15:29.920 --> 15:36.560
please. A poor, a poor craftsman blames his tools. So let me just say that my grass, my grass isn't

15:36.560 --> 15:41.360
shorter. No, but it is different. Let me get 40 though. Let me get 40 though for that. What do

15:41.360 --> 15:46.720
you think? I made it look weird. $40 please. Don't be cinchy on the tip. Some of us littler.

15:46.720 --> 15:54.400
And then I got very tired. I worked at blockbuster twice. I, uh, I was a newspaper carrier. I did

15:54.400 --> 16:00.240
that as a teen summer job. Um, you newspaper carried. And I think my mom and dad do so much

16:00.240 --> 16:07.280
of the work that they would not allow me to do it. I tried to. Yeah. Yeah. I kind of killed that

16:07.280 --> 16:12.880
golden goose and boy, I was making it hand over fist. I was actually so bad at collecting that

16:12.880 --> 16:16.720
in the end when you zeroed everything out, I was pretty much just doing like volunteer work

16:18.160 --> 16:22.320
to keep print alive. I had a summer job working for Justin, your father-in-law,

16:22.320 --> 16:27.600
the tri data incorporated, um, where I possessed a lot of, I would say natural talent and natural

16:27.600 --> 16:32.880
skill, but not a lot of natural showing up and doing it. I did instead possess a lot of natural.

16:32.880 --> 16:36.720
I'm going to go to Bonnaroo and just like check out the acts this year. Cause I hear it's going

16:36.720 --> 16:40.960
to be tight. So I'm going to need all of that time off work later. And then the next week,

16:40.960 --> 16:44.880
there was always another Bonnaroo. There were, there were several Bonnaroo's that summer.

16:44.880 --> 16:49.360
Griffin, Griffin worked at the tri data studios where things I bought at sheets is filmed.

16:49.360 --> 16:54.000
Mm-hmm. Uh, he worked there for how long did you make that last Griffin before you

16:54.000 --> 16:58.640
literally, literally a summer, one summer before my freshman year of college. Yeah.

16:59.520 --> 17:02.640
I was a legend. I was a legend. He scanned how many documents,

17:03.280 --> 17:07.520
4,000 documents, put them up on the board. There really was a board

17:07.520 --> 17:10.880
and 4,000 was actually very low on the number of documents.

17:10.880 --> 17:12.240
Yeah. Not a great job.

17:12.240 --> 17:15.840
Not a great job. It was a great job. I did a bad job.

17:15.840 --> 17:19.200
You didn't do a great job. Yeah. I did a bad job at it to be clear.

17:19.920 --> 17:23.040
But I did lay a lot of the groundwork that things I bought at sheets was built upon.

17:23.760 --> 17:26.960
That's true. We still find some of your leavings.

17:26.960 --> 17:27.760
And my riddles.

17:30.640 --> 17:35.600
I opened a ceiling tile yesterday and riddles just came flying out at me that Griffin had

17:35.600 --> 17:39.040
stored there. Yeah. Maybe that explains my low output.

17:39.040 --> 17:46.000
He was too busy filling the plates with riddles. He was too busy national treasuring it.

17:46.000 --> 17:50.800
Me and my girlfriend watch a lot and enjoy, I would hope, but you do both of those,

17:50.800 --> 17:55.520
a lot of Netflix and Hula together. My girlfriend watched a lot of Netflix and Hula just despise it.

17:55.520 --> 18:01.040
Uh, we enjoy it. And, uh, the only problem is that when we start a show, we both like,

18:01.040 --> 18:04.640
she will continue to watch it while I'm at work and be seven episodes ahead of me by the time I

18:04.640 --> 18:09.520
get home. What? I've tried to ask her to wait for me until I get off work and we watch it together,

18:09.520 --> 18:15.120
but she continues on in her sin and watches the show while I'm at work. How can I get her to stop

18:15.120 --> 18:20.480
and watch the show with me? P.S. My work schedule is 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., so I'm gone a lot of the

18:20.480 --> 18:25.520
time. I think your bigger question is, what do I do when my girlfriend dumps me because she does

18:25.520 --> 18:29.280
not like me very much? This relationship is headed for rocky waters, my friend.

18:29.280 --> 18:32.800
I was going to say just break up with her. Justin, I'm so glad we're on the same page.

18:32.800 --> 18:37.280
I don't- this relationship's over. This is like the keystone. It's 2015. Like,

18:38.000 --> 18:43.680
keeping your Netflix and Hulu episode count in sync is like the keystone of a happy marriage.

18:43.680 --> 18:48.320
If I- I- I saw a new book at the bookstore. It's called, uh, Men Are From Episode 16,

18:48.320 --> 18:52.560
Abortions of the New Black, and Women Are From Episode 10, and on the inside of the

18:52.560 --> 18:57.040
book it just says, fuck it. You're hosed. She has to have a show that she wants to

18:57.040 --> 19:03.040
watch that you don't. That's the secret. That's the secret. Is it- to keep this in line, you've

19:03.040 --> 19:08.880
gotta have your secret shows that each of you have, and then you have to have these shared shows,

19:08.880 --> 19:14.160
because it's not- it's not a question of them wanting to get further ahead. It's not a race.

19:14.160 --> 19:18.960
You know, Orange Is The New Black is not the race. Unless she just wants to feel like prescient,

19:18.960 --> 19:24.480
like, oh, you'll never know what happens next. Oh, something very exciting is coming.

19:24.480 --> 19:31.360
Um, you gotta have your stuff. Rachel's got her scandal. I just- I love Josh Molina. Oh,

19:31.360 --> 19:36.640
man, do I love Josh Molina. But it does not seem like my thing. Uh, in the same vein, for me,

19:36.640 --> 19:40.560
Twin Peaks. That's not Rachel's thing. That's not gonna be her thing. But if I'm sitting alone,

19:40.560 --> 19:46.640
and she's out, uh, doing a thing, and I'm at home not doing a thing, I'll turn on the Twin Peaks.

19:46.640 --> 19:50.320
And that's how we keep ourselves honest when it's time to burn through, you know,

19:50.320 --> 19:55.760
Key and Peele or something like that. There is another option that is probably less palatable

19:55.760 --> 20:00.320
for your girlfriend, but that is when you return home, you jump back to where you were,

20:00.880 --> 20:05.920
and she has to sit and watch the episode she's already seen. So if she's just doing it as a time

20:05.920 --> 20:10.480
filler, like, then you both still get to watch them together, but she gets to keep going.

20:10.480 --> 20:15.600
I guarantee if you, like, make her do that a couple times, she'll stop watching them without

20:15.600 --> 20:20.800
you, so as not to just have to repeat view them a couple times. Yeah. But it may get old for her.

20:21.360 --> 20:25.360
I love, Travis, the supposition you've made that he's gonna be able to tell her

20:25.360 --> 20:28.800
anything when it comes to Netflix. Yeah, sure. It sounds like, it sounds like this,

20:28.800 --> 20:33.200
this Bronco's done been let out the pen already, and I don't think he's gonna lasso that, that,

20:33.200 --> 20:37.040
that, that steed back, back into its, uh, horse pen. How much, how much more? Yeah, keep going.

20:37.040 --> 20:41.760
I want more rodeo. Justin and Sydney have been watching a lot of rodeo masters together.

20:41.760 --> 20:46.160
It's just in his brain. Let me hit you guys with this business opportunity is fiscal

20:46.160 --> 20:54.240
potential promise that I'm making to you. It is a dongle, USB dongle for your device,

20:54.240 --> 20:58.880
whatever device you use, uh, that is tied to your accounts. You can tie it to your Netflix

20:58.880 --> 21:03.840
account. You can tie it to your Apple TV. You can tie it to your Roku. I don't know. I don't know.

21:04.480 --> 21:08.160
All of your devices and your accounts and your boxes and your set top boxes and your devices

21:08.160 --> 21:11.920
and your peripherals. And you're going to have a dongle for it. And this dongle has two key holes

21:11.920 --> 21:16.080
in it and you each have a key and you have to activate it like a submarine. If you want to

21:16.080 --> 21:22.640
watch orange is the new black. I love it, Griffin. That's a wonderful, wonderful concept. I think she

21:22.640 --> 21:27.120
would just take his key though. Like you cannot hold this woman back from watching television.

21:27.120 --> 21:33.120
The key has a biometric key inside of it as well. Have you not seen leverage? There's a way around

21:33.120 --> 21:40.080
all of this because that biometric password is one password. And it's also, you have to provide a

21:40.080 --> 21:44.640
stool sample. So yes, yes, it's complicated. It's going to solve your problem, but you're

21:44.640 --> 21:49.600
going to have to take a shit every time you want to watch bloodlines or have some lying around,

21:49.600 --> 21:52.960
but Oh God, that actually gets into a problem because then you can get into the other person's

21:52.960 --> 21:57.760
shit. Okay. You're going to need a biometric say for your stool and your reserve stool.

21:57.760 --> 22:04.640
Your orange is the new black poop and hold on. This goes down so deep. Why don't you just like

22:04.640 --> 22:08.480
trust and love each other? I guess that's an easier option and you don't have to buy our dongle.

22:08.480 --> 22:14.800
If the roles were reversed, um, Sydney could definitely Trump me by saying that, Oh, that's

22:14.800 --> 22:22.160
okay. I'll just pick up wherever you're at. What are you serious? Oh, we would turn up when we first

22:22.160 --> 22:26.720
started dating, we would turn on shows and she would say, Oh yeah, I've seen some of the season.

22:26.720 --> 22:33.840
What? What did you say? You watched some of them and then stopped and then started watching.

22:33.840 --> 22:40.320
What are you even saying? I don't even understand. I read the first and middle chapters of that book.

22:40.320 --> 22:44.240
Who does that? I mean, I did. If I was like cheating to get through my accelerator,

22:46.000 --> 22:51.040
I read every other page of treasure Island. I'm just saying, if you don't sync up with your

22:51.040 --> 22:54.960
partner, when you're watching your favorite television shows, then you're being a real

22:54.960 --> 22:59.600
goober boy. So I said it like that. So it'd be like an inside joke that like, maybe it would

22:59.600 --> 23:03.280
seem like we've referenced that in past episodes of my brother, my brother and me. And so like,

23:03.280 --> 23:06.240
people would think like, wait a minute, did you listen to that episode to their partner?

23:06.240 --> 23:09.280
If they listened to my brother, my brother and me in that way, just to sort of like throw them

23:09.280 --> 23:14.080
off as like a practical joke. But what about this part, Griffin? But you've just said that you just

23:14.080 --> 23:18.880
explained why you did it. Well, I was hoping that one of the partners would be laughing so loud that

23:18.880 --> 23:24.960
they can't hear this. Okay. The great goober boy joke. Well, it's a, it's a conceptual, but you didn't

23:24.960 --> 23:28.960
before. It was an alternate reality. It was an alternate. It was an alternate. It was an

23:28.960 --> 23:38.160
alternate reality game. Griffin. That was genius. Thank you. Griffin, Griffin, Griffin.

23:39.280 --> 23:45.760
I'm honored to work with you. Happy Father's Day. You guys want another Yahoo?

23:45.760 --> 23:53.120
Sure. Was that all the opening? Yeah. Let's get to our first question. This Yahoo was sent in by

23:53.120 --> 23:57.840
Zoe Kinski climbing that ladder. Thank you Zoe Kinski. It's by Yahoo answers user VB who asks,

23:59.360 --> 24:05.120
does anyone practice baby massage on their six, 12 month old baby? A friend of mine is

24:05.120 --> 24:09.440
trained in baby massage and showed me how to do it on my little boy when he was about three months

24:09.440 --> 24:13.840
old. He loved it, but I didn't really continue with it as much as I should have. Now he is eight

24:13.840 --> 24:16.800
months old and he is having trouble with his teething and sleeping problems. So I thought

24:16.800 --> 24:22.960
perhaps baby massage would help. Only problem is he is now so active. I can't get him to stay still

24:22.960 --> 24:27.040
long enough. He gets frustrated if I try and keep him lying down. I don't really want to try and

24:27.040 --> 24:31.440
make him anyway. Is that defeats the purpose of baby massage as you are only supposed to do it

24:31.440 --> 24:36.000
when they are relaxed. So I was just wondering if anyone on here has been more successful with their

24:36.000 --> 24:43.200
LO and little one. Correct. And if you have any tips, thanks X. This is a Father's Day question

24:43.200 --> 24:50.480
just for Justin about his baby massage techniques. Yeah, I, they're good for when the baby is trying

24:50.480 --> 24:57.200
to get to sleep. It can be useful to, to, I found that that soothes her sometimes. Oops. Oops. This

24:57.200 --> 25:00.800
is supposed to be a joke. Is this baby massage a real thing? Well, yeah, massage is like a real

25:00.800 --> 25:05.440
thing. Well, it's also important to use it after your baby's had a tough week at work. Maybe the

25:05.440 --> 25:11.280
boss has been riding. So this, so okay. Baby massage is a real thing, but to Travis's point,

25:11.280 --> 25:18.880
I, the, the problem I had with baby massage is what am I, what, what, what stress is this,

25:19.520 --> 25:27.200
what stress is this baby trying to unwind from? Like I saw your whole day, baby. You ate some

25:27.200 --> 25:33.120
Cheetos and then fell asleep in the car and then watched cartoons forever and then went to sleep

25:33.120 --> 25:39.200
at seven. Your life is fucking dope as hell. I would trade, I would Freaky Friday you in a

25:39.200 --> 25:45.200
heartbeat. Why am I going to massage you? How about you get those little feet, get those little

25:45.200 --> 25:49.440
puppies up on daddy's back and walk on dad's back and massage him cause dad's had a day. Thanks for

25:49.440 --> 25:54.400
the rub down pops. Mom left the room, thought she existed no more. Yeah, that's the thing,

25:54.400 --> 25:58.160
that object permanence Justin, that is the stressful thing. Can you imagine if every time

25:58.160 --> 26:02.400
Sydney left the room was like, well Sydney's not here anymore. Shit. You would get some tension

26:02.400 --> 26:08.480
up in your sacrum and stuff. Sydney is not now nor ever was. No, whoops. Yeah, but then it's

26:08.480 --> 26:14.000
counterbalanced by the fact that every, every like two minutes you got to be like, I have a mother.

26:17.040 --> 26:25.600
It's all balanced out. Oh man. That doesn't relax you. Run me through your baby massage techniques

26:25.600 --> 26:32.400
are there aromatherapeutic elements? What do you ask her? You get the, you light a Barney scented

26:32.400 --> 26:38.720
candle. What does that smell? What does Barney smell like? Like the sweaty inside of a sweaty

26:38.720 --> 26:43.440
suit. It is very unpopular. I bet that I bet actually a baby would like that because for

26:43.440 --> 26:47.760
like nine months a baby was like inside of a sweaty suit. That's what it's like to be in utero

26:47.760 --> 26:53.280
inside of a Barney costume or any costume. I used to play cowabunga, the WTCR mascot of our daddy's

26:53.280 --> 26:58.080
radio station. So it was basically like I was having a, a rebirth experience every time that

26:58.080 --> 27:04.000
I was chili fest rolled around. Where is that? He should be here by now. I don't know. I don't know.

27:04.000 --> 27:07.760
Oh, he just texted. He said he's running about 15 minutes late. If he's not in the room,

27:07.760 --> 27:12.000
then I refuse to acknowledge his existence. The apps are going to get cold. I don't know.

27:12.880 --> 27:17.920
Baby, you like squeeze their little hands and arms and like, is it just squeezing the baby back?

27:17.920 --> 27:21.280
What? It's just basically squeezing. That sounds like it's more for you than it is for her.

27:21.920 --> 27:25.760
I didn't really, I didn't really learn how to do it. I got as far as learning that it's a thing and

27:25.760 --> 27:30.720
then just kind of went crazy. Well, I am of the school. It's not something you can learn. It's

27:30.720 --> 27:36.000
something you either can do or you can't like, look at your hands. Look at that baby does one

27:36.000 --> 27:40.960
and one make two. You know what I mean? Yeah, for sure. I like to, I like to take an Ashiatsu

27:40.960 --> 27:47.440
approach. A lot of, uh, you mix in some, some, uh, oh, some cleansing yoga and then you, uh,

27:47.440 --> 27:52.240
and this part's, oh man, be careful, but you got to stand on your baby and you're not going to want

27:52.240 --> 27:56.400
to do it and the baby's not going to want to do it. And don't do cupping. A lot of people will

27:56.400 --> 28:01.760
say, cup the baby. Don't. No, you'll get, you'll suck the whole baby up into it. Charlie really

28:01.760 --> 28:09.280
enjoys, uh, baby acupuncture. And that takes a steady hand, boy. And you have to pink the needles

28:09.280 --> 28:15.360
in some parts. Because, oh my goodness, there is not a lot of area on that baby that's expendable.

28:16.800 --> 28:21.440
Especially if you're going in the ocular region, who, boy. I mean, the baby gets the,

28:21.440 --> 28:24.880
well, they get tension headaches. Is there a difference between that and hot stone?

28:26.080 --> 28:30.400
Hot stone? Oh no, for that I just leave the baby out on the sidewalk because I feel like

28:30.400 --> 28:35.120
it's been, it's been sunny all day and that'll be, that'll be fun. And also daddy needs a drink and

28:35.120 --> 28:40.960
a nap. Catch you in 15, little kid. I guess I prefer it when babies massage each other,

28:40.960 --> 28:46.320
um, just sort of like in like a seductive way because it's like more pure and, um, like the

28:46.320 --> 28:52.240
energy will be better. Mm-hmm. It's good to, um, it's good to do baby massage outside on the lawn,

28:52.240 --> 28:57.360
but do not leave your baby unattended for too long or they will be carried away by ants.

28:57.360 --> 29:01.840
Yeah. That is a, that is a parenting tip from me to you. It would, it would blow your mind

29:01.840 --> 29:06.240
how many babies get carried away by ants. Ants are very strong. Just one per year,

29:06.240 --> 29:12.080
but then they get to be the ant king or queen. Uh, listen, acupuncture needles aren't gonna

29:12.080 --> 29:16.640
buy themselves. So, uh, let's go to the money zone. Especially not these super little ones.

29:16.640 --> 29:28.400
Yeah. With all the fun colors.

29:28.400 --> 29:33.200
My brother, my brother and me is supported in part by Casper, an online retailer of premium,

29:33.200 --> 29:38.640
obsessively engineered mattresses for a fraction of the price. Now I know it's weird what you're

29:38.640 --> 29:43.600
thinking. Buy a mattress without sleeping on it. That's insane. So what Casper does is a risk-free

29:43.600 --> 29:49.680
trial and return policy. You can try sleeping on one for a hundred days and you get free delivery

29:49.680 --> 29:53.680
and painless returns. That's a lot of farts you can put in that mattress. Travis. You can put a

29:53.680 --> 29:57.840
lot of farts in that mattress. Justin. You can fill that mattress with farts and send it back.

29:57.840 --> 30:01.680
You would double the weight of that mattress before you send it back. Travis. If you listen

30:01.680 --> 30:06.400
our show, you can get $50 towards any mattress purchase if you go to Casper.com slash my brother

30:06.400 --> 30:10.800
and then use the coupon code, my brother, all one word at checkout. Terms and conditions do apply.

30:10.800 --> 30:15.840
Travis, you, uh, you have been sleeping on a Casper. Uh, how's that working out for you?

30:16.480 --> 30:22.160
Um, it was interesting at first because I prefer a bit of a softer mattress and Teresa prefers a

30:22.160 --> 30:29.600
firmer mattress. And this is such an interesting balance of those two that now it's been about a

30:29.600 --> 30:34.320
month, I would say, since we started sleeping on it. I can't imagine sleeping on anything else.

30:34.320 --> 30:39.920
It's it's because it's memory foam. It's very soft, but because of the engineering of it,

30:39.920 --> 30:44.160
it's also a very firm. So it's like a very firm memory foam. I highly recommend it.

30:44.160 --> 30:48.400
Um, been getting a lot of good sleeps. It says here that these mattresses are obsessively

30:48.400 --> 30:52.560
engineered. That's not just a, like a bullet point that literally you are guaranteed that

30:52.560 --> 30:57.440
an engineer went mad with every mattress that they create. Every mattress they get,

30:57.440 --> 31:01.920
they, they basically burn out an engineer's mind and, and they succumb to the darkness.

31:01.920 --> 31:05.920
Now, one out of every hundred mattresses is haunted by that engineer.

31:05.920 --> 31:09.280
Oh, and you got to be careful with that one. What do you think they call it? Casper? What

31:09.280 --> 31:16.960
do you think the next thing is like the next sponsor? Oh yeah. Next sponsor is a slip shine.

congrats on graduating from nursing school. You did it. Depending on when this gets red,

32:53.600 --> 32:58.800
maybe congrats on taking your boards too. I like that. Here's to freedom from classes,

32:58.800 --> 33:04.560
more visits to the adventure zone and lots of texts about our weird injuries and illnesses.

33:04.560 --> 33:11.200
Oh, and saving lives. We're so proud of you. You're a pal and a confidant and we rely on each

33:11.200 --> 33:18.320
other. Oh, is that the golden girls theme song? No, that's islands in the stream. I got those two

33:18.320 --> 33:22.560
confused. Didn't I? You did. You did get those two confused. Both great tunes. Let me get on the ones

33:22.560 --> 33:26.320
and twos real quick. And cause now I've got the inspiration and if I don't do it now, I'll forget

33:26.320 --> 33:32.400
about it. Here comes the birthday mashup. Kate from us to you. My name is Ez. This is my new

33:32.400 --> 33:36.080
band. I'm putting together a new musical artists. I'm calling myself golden girl talk.

33:36.800 --> 33:42.560
Um, that was a great joke and it was pearls before swine. I leave that for the audience.

33:43.680 --> 33:50.240
I, uh, the only song that Charlie likes is all about that base. The only song that Charlie

33:50.240 --> 33:54.880
liked. It used to be that and smoke weed every day. Uh, but now it's just all about that base.

33:54.880 --> 33:59.760
I've listened to that fucking song so many times that I've started inadvertently creating mashups

33:59.760 --> 34:03.920
in my head between that and other songs that I like more than all about that base, which is to

34:03.920 --> 34:10.160
say basically any of them at this point. So I will often walk down my house singing to myself. Let me

34:10.160 --> 34:17.280
see if I can do it. All about that base, about that base. No trouble. You'd like to think that

34:17.280 --> 34:22.320
you're immune to this stuff. Oh my God, that's fresh. It's a really good, it's a really good

34:22.320 --> 34:26.560
mix. If somebody could like edit that and make it into like a mix I can listen to, maybe my baby

34:26.560 --> 34:33.600
will like that. I can transition her gradually to any other song by mixing up with, uh, all about

34:33.600 --> 34:38.320
that base. I don't know. I got a message for Crystal from Daniel. Uh, Jumbotron, Jumbotron,

34:38.320 --> 34:44.240
gather ye earbuds from nerd and far. These brothers, three wisely studs come with a birthday

34:44.240 --> 34:49.840
revelation going out to cross the nation. Okay, this is, this is iambic pentameter. This is a poem

34:49.840 --> 34:53.520
and you're reading it. You're just, you're, you're, you're butchering it. You're butchering it. But

34:53.520 --> 34:57.600
it's not broken up. It's hard to read the meter. Well, they did it in a straight up ye coming

34:57.600 --> 35:04.000
style. You've got a brain and two eyes. Jumbotron, Jumbotron, gather ye earbuds from nerd and far.

35:04.000 --> 35:10.160
These brothers, three wisely studs come with a revelation going out across the nation to one

35:10.160 --> 35:16.720
garbage deli with dumps like a truck and other delicious delicatessens. Happy birthday, Crystal,

35:16.720 --> 35:21.600
and thanks for all the genuine microwave cheeseburgers and especially the McElroy's.

35:21.600 --> 35:27.040
I did appreciate how you tried to make that last sentence rhyme. I also really like it had more of

35:27.040 --> 35:33.040
like a slam poem. Yeah, I was kind of hoping you would slam it even harder than you slammed it. Like

35:33.040 --> 35:40.240
I want like a monster dump. Man, this, this rhyming stuff is easy. Happy birthday, Crystal. I hope

35:40.880 --> 35:45.040
this is the gift you were hoping for. No, it's probably like an iPod Nano or something.

35:45.040 --> 35:52.480

Trav, you want to read the next question? I do. Yeah, sure. Hit it. Oh,

36:16.000 --> 36:22.240
I see what's going to happen here. I get interrupted all the time. No, wait, you know what? Let me,

36:22.240 --> 36:25.760
let me just do it. I'll just do it. It's fine. I get interrupted all the time. Hey, actually,

36:25.760 --> 36:29.920
you know what? I can hop in here if you guys want me to. Oh yeah, sure. That's fine. Go ahead. Okay.

36:29.920 --> 36:33.840
I get interrupted all the, hey, it's me, Sheila. I came by to see if you guys were good. If you

36:33.840 --> 36:39.280
still wanted to order or not, because we've got customers waiting in the aisles. This is a different

36:39.280 --> 36:46.080
person. Sheila's the manager. Sheila's the manager. I run this Applebee's on 16th Street in Lexington

36:46.080 --> 36:50.720
Avenue, and I'm telling you guys, you can't just sit here drinking water. The water's not free.

36:50.720 --> 36:54.000
It is free with the purchase of a meal, but now you're starting to get my gall.

36:54.640 --> 36:59.520
Sheila, let's work something out. We host a comedy podcast. You see all the microphones around the

36:59.520 --> 37:03.920
table. Yeah, I thought we had those installed before, and I didn't think there were, I didn't

37:03.920 --> 37:10.880
think there were microphones. I thought they were bottles of A1 sauce. We just had our microphones

37:10.880 --> 37:16.400
painted to look like bottles of A1 sauce because it helps us focus our recording. How about we

37:16.400 --> 37:20.800
could make you a podcast celebrity? If you let us keep sitting here waiting for our daddy,

37:20.800 --> 37:26.400
we'll let you read a question on our podcast. I'm interested in fame. I get more than enough

37:26.400 --> 37:31.040
fame working here at the Applebee's on 16th and Lexington. People know my name. I have a

37:31.040 --> 37:35.840
distinctive voice. I'm very memorable. My name is Sheila, and I'm the Applebee's manager. If you

37:35.840 --> 37:43.040
work at an Applebee's, statistically speaking, you probably will at some point be the subject of a

37:43.040 --> 37:50.960
snarky opinion column on a food blog at some point. For sure. I run my own food blog. What's it called?

37:50.960 --> 37:57.440
It's called Five People You Meet in Heaven. Listen, you guys can take it. You seem like a good bunch.

37:57.440 --> 38:01.120
I'm gonna, I'm gonna let you, I'm gonna get out of here. I just, can I take a drink order? Can I

38:01.120 --> 38:07.200
do anything for you? I ordered a jalapeno mudslide that still hasn't come yet. I will check into

38:07.200 --> 38:15.280
that, sir. I'm just, I'm grossly sorry. I will also take two brutuses. Do you want those all in

38:15.280 --> 38:21.360
same glass or do you just want me to pour them in some sort of gravy boat? Same glass is fine. Terrific. I'm

38:21.360 --> 38:27.120
gonna get that gravy boat too on the free, on the free cheese. I get arrested all the time.

38:27.120 --> 38:31.120
Is that one of the collectible ones with the Star Trek characters on it? Yeah, it's one of the Star

38:31.120 --> 38:34.640
Trek gravy boats. I'll see y'all later. Hey, I'll talk to you guys. See you tomorrow.

38:34.640 --> 38:43.520
I already missed Sheila. Yeah, me too. I missed the first guy,

38:43.520 --> 38:49.600
but I couldn't remember what his voice sounded like. I'm sorry, Trav. Go ahead. I get interrupted all

38:49.600 --> 38:53.520
the time. No, you know what? I don't, I don't want to break the tradition. Whether I'm telling a

38:53.520 --> 38:57.360
long-winded story or just trying to finish a sentence, it seems like people have no problem

38:57.360 --> 39:03.520
with just talking over me before I've made my point. It's really starting to bug me,

39:04.960 --> 39:09.520
but I don't know. I don't know how to tell people to pipe down. This is going to be impossible to

39:09.520 --> 39:14.720
edit. Don't edit. Why would you edit this? This has all been gold. Let me finish without coming

39:14.720 --> 39:18.160
off like a jerk. How do I get my friends to STFU for like a second without sounding like a complete

39:18.160 --> 39:25.680
dick constantly cut off in Colorado? What I, the way I did deal with this when I did Children's

39:25.680 --> 39:33.440
Theater is I would stop mid-sentence and just stop. Just stop my thought. Stop it. Just let

39:33.440 --> 39:37.680
the awkwardness hang there. And if they don't want to come back to me, that's fine. That's

39:37.680 --> 39:42.080
their prerogative. It probably wasn't that important anyway. I can also say as someone who

39:42.080 --> 39:49.200
interrupts people a lot, the best defense against getting interrupted is to keep the energy you are

39:49.200 --> 39:53.600
using, the conversational energy you are using up. Because a lot of the time when I interrupt people,

39:53.600 --> 39:59.680
it's because you're trying to save them. What? They're bombing. Well, yeah, I feel like they're,

40:00.800 --> 40:04.160
so it's something you deal with like in acting, especially in Shakespeare, not going down at the

40:04.160 --> 40:09.280
end of lines because people will tend to like drop their energy as they get to the end of a thought.

40:09.280 --> 40:14.720
So you're suggesting that when you or anybody else interrupts a person, it's because they

40:14.720 --> 40:20.720
weren't being hype enough. It's their fault. Well, no, it's because they felt like I think they run

40:20.720 --> 40:26.560
out of things to say, but they won't let themselves stop talking. I'm doing them a favor by interrupting.

40:28.160 --> 40:35.200
That is a demented way to think about things. It just seems like. I mean, yeah, I'm not saying it's

40:35.200 --> 40:39.360
like a healthy mindset. I'm just saying that that is the idea of like, I want to keep the ball in

40:39.360 --> 40:44.320
the air and it feels like their energy is flagging. So I'm going to take over for them and then they

40:44.320 --> 40:49.200
can jump back in. Why not just say that then? Instead of hopping in and seeming rude, why

40:49.200 --> 40:52.560
don't you let them know that you're doing them a favor and be like, hold on, hold on, hold on.

40:52.560 --> 40:56.960
Let me step in here because you take a break. Go, go take a drink of water. Your mouth sounds very

40:56.960 --> 41:02.400
dry. Have you confronted these people? Like literally just said like, hey, I don't know

41:02.400 --> 41:07.040
if you realize you're doing it, but you interrupt me a lot. What if they can't even get that out,

41:07.040 --> 41:13.760
though? Are they are they invisible? Are they a ghost person? Like maybe just wait a minute.

41:13.760 --> 41:24.160
Are you a ghost? Oh, shit. Have you been a ghost this whole time? The earbuds fall out of his ears

41:24.160 --> 41:28.320
and roll across the floor. He pictures all the red things he's come in contact with over the

41:28.320 --> 41:36.400
last 16 years. He looks in a mirror. It's the first time he's looked at a mirror ever. I think

41:36.400 --> 41:40.880
a ghost would be able to see themselves. I don't know the rule on. Is it a ghost mirror? That's a

41:40.880 --> 41:45.360
good question. Travis didn't even think about that. The mirror must be haunted. That's my

41:46.320 --> 41:50.800
favorite Barbara Streisand movie. The mirror must be haunted. Can we talk about what?

41:51.920 --> 41:57.840
If he can only interact with red objects. Is that some sort of ghost lore that I don't know about?

41:57.840 --> 42:01.120
Like ghosts love cherry lifesavers. They're the only ones that can eat and taste and they're

42:01.120 --> 42:06.880
delicious. No, Griffin. Those are the road flags planted that every time it was a ghost moment,

42:06.880 --> 42:12.400
that there was something red there. Not that his power was only to interact with red things.

42:12.400 --> 42:15.600
That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard. Was that for us, the viewers? I'm getting angry. Do

42:15.600 --> 42:20.480
you guys want a Yahoo? Sure. This one's for dads out there in the audience. If you're a dad,

42:20.480 --> 42:25.920
listen. Congratulations. It's sent in by Zoe Kinski climbing that ladder. Thank you, Zoe. It's by

42:25.920 --> 42:33.120
Yahoo Answers user unknown who asks, how to make my dad stop using words like swag. He is ruining

42:33.120 --> 42:42.560
my life. I am 16 and my dad is 40 something. Learn your dad's age. Everybody learn your dad.

42:42.560 --> 42:45.680
I can't tell you how many people I talked to. You're like, how old is your dad? And I don't

42:45.680 --> 42:50.240
know. I don't know. 50 something. I can't tell you how many times I've listened to Griffin ask

42:50.240 --> 42:54.720
people how old their dads are. And that's what I want to intercede on his behalf. Well, yeah.

42:54.720 --> 43:00.240
Cause it's a competition. The oldest dad or youngest dad or tightest dad bod or which dad

43:00.240 --> 43:04.640
traveled the farthest to get here today. Yeah. Yeah. Most likely to succeed. My dad has the

43:04.640 --> 43:13.680
prettiest eyes. Class clown. Did not succeed is another one. Biggest failure. Anyway, my dad is

43:13.680 --> 43:18.400
40 something and IDK if his having a midlife crisis or something, but he keeps using words

43:18.400 --> 43:25.760
like swag, YOLO. And then there's some like at sign hash pound percent at like maybe they're

43:25.760 --> 43:32.880
cursing or maybe this dad is just like yelling YOLO and then using profanity. Um, bro chilling

43:32.880 --> 43:40.160
with my bros dudes sup and then in words, but that's not, that's different. That's a whole

43:40.160 --> 43:47.440
another can of worms. Um, it's a whole other dad per se. Yeah. Uh, that's not that exclusive.

43:47.440 --> 43:52.880
That's a just bad, uh, et cetera. I think you get what I mean. And it's so annoying because he's

43:52.880 --> 43:56.320
trying to act all cool and stuff, but it's just so weird. For example, yesterday my friends were

43:56.320 --> 44:00.800
here and we were playing this video game my friend brought and he walks in all like sup bros,

44:00.800 --> 44:07.360
are you chilling? You want some beer? And then he attempted to high five my friends. Oh God.

44:07.360 --> 44:11.200
And he took a look at the game and he was like sick game. You've got dude

44:13.760 --> 44:18.080
update. I actually did ask him to just stop because he's making a fool out of himself.

44:18.080 --> 44:23.440
And you know what he said? He literally said blank, please. I'm guessing that is another

44:23.440 --> 44:28.560
racial slur, racial charge word and left. It's getting out of control. I know this might sound

44:28.560 --> 44:33.120
fake, but he's like that. That's why I'm here. Update number two. Ooh, long narrative on this

44:33.120 --> 44:38.400
one. Dad and I have come to an understanding. I didn't appreciate him. He didn't appreciate me.

44:38.400 --> 44:43.440
We've grown closer as friends. No, instead a update to the copy of updates who reads

44:43.440 --> 44:52.960
he said inward please and we are not even black. Seriously. This question asked by Timmy Hawk.

44:54.320 --> 44:58.400
No, Tony Hawk is a perfectly just and I interviewed Tony Hawk for our job

44:58.400 --> 45:02.880
and he's a perfectly lovely man. Also, Tony Hawk's son is not Timmy. I brought this up because there

45:02.880 --> 45:07.440
was a commercial that popped on Hulu the other day of like Tony Hawk, like had his kid, like he's

45:07.440 --> 45:11.120
driving a car, his kids are in the back seat and they're all like boarding on their phones and

45:11.120 --> 45:16.880
stuff and he like peels off the road and drives to like an abandoned water park and they like all

45:16.880 --> 45:22.240
skateboard around the park. Hell yes. I was left with this genuine feeling of I bet he's an awesome

45:22.240 --> 45:27.760
dad. Oh, he's the best dad in the world. Yeah, the only problem is he named his first child 360 bones.

45:30.560 --> 45:37.600
And then the second one, Ollie. And it's like, okay, that's better. But then his second son was

45:37.600 --> 45:42.800
born without bones and I bet he was like, oh, if only I'd waited. And he named his third son

45:42.800 --> 45:50.080
Harry Potter. That's just what he was into. And then his fourth son he named Giant Flaming. So

45:50.080 --> 45:56.400
his name would be Giant Flaming Hawk, which is a pretty sweet name. It's my son Thunder Hawk.

45:56.400 --> 46:00.160
How do you make my dad stop using these words? These terrible, terrible words. A lot of these

46:00.160 --> 46:03.360
words I think are fine for your dad to use and I'm kind of excited about them. Obviously

46:03.360 --> 46:11.200
not the racially charged ones. It depends on how he how he's. Let's take the racially charged words

46:11.200 --> 46:16.800
out of the conversation because that's a whole nother can of worms. Yeah, you have to be a

46:16.800 --> 46:21.760
pretty cool dad to pull those off. Am I right, guys? Yeah. But if he's if he's coming in with

46:21.760 --> 46:26.080
like swag and yellow, is he saying like this? Yeah. What up, bros? Or is he coming and going,

46:26.080 --> 46:37.360
yo, what up bros? Huh? Yolo? Who here is a cool homie who wants to swig some of my beer, Yolo?

46:38.480 --> 46:44.320
I'm going to a group hang with my other swag dads. Swag dads would be an awesome bowling

46:44.320 --> 46:49.920
league name. Hashtag swag dads. Hashtag swag dads. It's just a chill hang at the Sitco.

46:49.920 --> 46:58.240
I'm going to meet some other dads at the DMV. Gonna get our car registration on. Yeah,

46:58.960 --> 47:03.760
you know we gotta get that state approved identification. I'm gonna go because they

47:03.760 --> 47:11.520
revoked our license for drunk driving. Hashtag swag dads. We got all silly with some four loco

47:11.520 --> 47:21.520
and then we got in my Jeep Grand Cherokee. Steve died. Damn, I'm gonna go meet my other gearhead

47:21.520 --> 47:25.600
dads and we're gonna go get our rides checked to get them inspected, which is something you have to

47:25.600 --> 47:31.600
do once a year just so you know for the future. You have that to look forward to, Yolo. Hey,

47:31.600 --> 47:38.240
kids, Rolos. It's not the thing. I just, does anybody want any delicious Rolos candy? Maybe

47:38.240 --> 47:42.960
I'll get a sweet new Hummer with some neon on the bottom. Just kidding. With these gas prices,

47:42.960 --> 47:47.920
I think I'm gonna go with sort of a midsize sedan. But anybody wants some of this purple

47:47.920 --> 47:58.400
drink? By which I mean grape, clearly Canadian. Which is clear. By the way, I put some purple

47:58.400 --> 48:06.160
food coloring in it. Yolo. I'm getting down on some caesarip. By which I mean, I'm robo tripping,

48:06.160 --> 48:11.600
I meant. Because I have a head cold and so I do. I'm gonna hit the sack early. Night, you guys.

48:11.600 --> 48:15.600
Don't stay up too late. Don't wake up your mother. I love you. I love you all so much.

48:15.600 --> 48:21.440
I love all of you. I know that Bryce is my only one of you who's a son, but I feel like we're

48:21.440 --> 48:26.240
connected with you guys. You all have so much potential. I feel like I just don't want to see

48:26.240 --> 48:31.280
you waste it. I'm proud of all of you. I know for a while you guys have just thought of me as Bryce's

48:31.280 --> 48:36.800
dad, but it would actually help me out a lot. And I think it would help us build a stronger relationship

48:36.800 --> 48:40.800
if you would think of me as your 420 Yolo swag. Do you guys like-

48:42.000 --> 48:44.160
Hey, don't stay up too late. Do you guys like Drake?

48:44.160 --> 48:48.400
Hey, you guys remember when I burned those pizza rolls a while ago and everybody was really upset

48:48.400 --> 48:51.440
and we didn't have any more? I feel like we came out of that with a real like,

48:51.440 --> 48:56.240
standby me vibe. Like a real brotherhood, like just really connected. Like we're never gonna

48:56.240 --> 49:01.200
forget it. Do you guys get the same sense or is that just- okay. Please don't wake up your mother.

49:01.200 --> 49:03.040
Please don't wake up your mother. It's final.

49:03.040 --> 49:07.120
And don't come into my bedroom later because I'm gonna be crushing some guts up there.

49:08.640 --> 49:10.080
I love you all so much.

49:10.080 --> 49:14.240
I love you all so much. Some of you more than Bryce.

49:15.360 --> 49:18.320
And also, I was just kidding about that. We're probably gonna hit that hair early.

49:19.520 --> 49:23.920
Bryce's mom and I haven't touched each other in years. Okay. Good night, everybody. Yolo.

49:23.920 --> 49:28.960
We're gonna go up there and finish True Detective for a season and then we're gonna hit the hair.

49:28.960 --> 49:32.400
Now that I've got you kids here though, I do want to talk to you about crushing guts

49:32.400 --> 49:39.120
because it's important that you do it responsibly in a place where you feel safe. I know for you

49:39.120 --> 49:44.640
guys, you think you know all there is to know about crushing guts and busting nuts, but there's

49:44.640 --> 49:50.400
a lot more to it than that. There's a lot more to it than that. It's a promise. When you crush a gut,

49:50.400 --> 49:51.760
it's a promise you're making.

49:51.760 --> 49:55.040
You know what's really cool, guys? Safe sex.

49:56.160 --> 50:00.400
Safe sex. If you're gonna bust a nut, make sure you put a Jimmy cap on your dunger.

50:00.400 --> 50:00.720
Yeah.

50:00.720 --> 50:01.920
All right. We've lost a bit.

50:01.920 --> 50:03.040
Okay. Good night, everybody.

50:03.040 --> 50:04.000
Good night, everyone.

50:04.000 --> 50:07.760
Hey, listen. Please, please don't wake up your mother.

50:07.760 --> 50:08.560
Oh my gosh.

50:08.560 --> 50:10.640
Don't tell her I talked to you guys about this. Yolo.

50:11.840 --> 50:14.720
Don't tell her I talked out loud without her permission. You know how she gets.

50:15.520 --> 50:18.000
Please be out of here before she wakes up if she finds you guys here.

50:18.000 --> 50:18.880
Please be gone.

50:18.880 --> 50:20.480
I'm not allowed to have friends over.

50:20.480 --> 50:26.240
What if your dad talked a bunch of shit like this, and then Dakota crossed you, and he's like,

50:26.240 --> 50:30.080
I'm gonna go get loked on Dakota's dad, and he went out and just blew Dakota's dad away.

50:31.120 --> 50:36.640
Just like, full drive-by, like, holy shit, dad. He's like, I know. I've been trying to tell you

50:36.640 --> 50:40.400
guys I'm gangster as hell. You shouldn't have tried to-

50:40.400 --> 50:44.320
I was supposed to go be a deacon at the church tonight, but I'm gonna take a break to go kill

50:44.320 --> 50:45.680
Dakota's dad.

50:45.680 --> 50:50.480
I call my boy Nate Dog. I call my boy Nate Dog's dad, and we had to go regulate.

50:50.480 --> 50:55.520
Nate Dog's dad would be 88 years old at this point. Are we regulating?

50:58.720 --> 51:01.520
I'm gonna need someone to roll me out.

51:01.520 --> 51:04.880
Hey, thanks so much for listening to our podcast, my brother, my brother, and me.

51:04.880 --> 51:08.960
We hope you've had a lot of fun. Listen, if you're in the Seattle or Vancouver area,

51:08.960 --> 51:13.840
or you can get there, we're gonna be doing a live show there at the end of August.

51:13.840 --> 51:21.760
Bit.ly forward slash mbnbamseattle, bit.ly forward slash van mbnbam.

51:21.760 --> 51:27.360
Those tickets are going quickly, so please buy some tickets. It's reserved seating, so the

51:27.360 --> 51:32.080
longer you wait, the worse your seats will be, so make sure you go right now and go buy some

51:32.080 --> 51:35.280
tickets to those shows. Buy tickets to all the shows, and then just come to all of them.

51:35.280 --> 51:37.600
We're gonna drive to all of them. Why can't you?

51:38.240 --> 51:40.240
Well, they can't buy ones to the Portland ones.

51:40.240 --> 51:45.360
Don't buy ones to the Portland shows. It's sold out, but the other ones do it.

51:45.360 --> 51:46.560
Yeah, why not?

51:46.560 --> 51:51.840
It's different stuff. Jeff, at least 60% different jokes every night. I can guarantee you that.

51:51.840 --> 51:55.200
The stunts will be the same, and the games, those are mostly gonna be the same.

51:55.920 --> 52:01.760
If you haven't yet, we really appreciate it if you would go to iTunes and subscribe,

52:01.760 --> 52:07.600
rate, review, help bump us up them old iTunes charts. It makes us feel good and makes you

52:07.600 --> 52:11.360
look awesome. I don't know how, but it does.

52:11.360 --> 52:14.160
All right, excuse me, are you reviewing a podcast on iTunes?

52:14.720 --> 52:16.640
You seem like one slag dad.

52:16.640 --> 52:18.640
Do you mind if I crush your guts?

52:20.720 --> 52:23.680
Thank you so much to John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song

52:23.680 --> 52:26.560
instead of Parchu off the album, Putting the Days to Bed. We got to kick it

52:26.560 --> 52:30.320
with John Roderick at Max Funcon. By the way, thank you to everybody who came to Max Funcon.

52:30.320 --> 52:35.440
That was a hell of a fun weekend. We had a good time chatting with John about his Seattle

52:35.440 --> 52:41.760
City Council campaign. If you live in the city of Seattle, look him up. Look up his platform.

52:41.760 --> 52:43.600
He's got some real good ideas.

52:44.800 --> 52:49.360
And just go vote in the primary. The primary's coming up. It's like August 1st, I think.

52:49.360 --> 52:50.800
Yeah, so go do that.

52:51.840 --> 52:55.680
He's a super sweet dude. Thank you, John Roderick. Go listen to the other shows on the Max Funcon

52:55.680 --> 53:00.160
network, too. We have other shows that we do, like The Adventure Zone, which is a D&D podcast

53:00.160 --> 53:04.320
that the three of us do with our dad. It's a super fun show. If you don't know anything

53:04.320 --> 53:10.080
about D&D, we don't either, so it's a pretty good barrier or a low barrier of entry, I guess.

53:10.080 --> 53:13.680
But then we got Justin Has Sawbones, which he does with his wife, Sydney, about medical

53:13.680 --> 53:17.520
history. Travis has Bunker Buddies that he does with his friend, Andy, about different

53:17.520 --> 53:24.560
apocalypses. And then there's a bunch of other shows on the Max Funcon network, like Throwing

53:24.560 --> 53:29.360
Shade and Lady 2 Lady and International Waters, which is hilarious. We saw a live taping of that

53:29.360 --> 53:33.200
at Max Funcon, too. There's so many good shows. They're all free. Go to maxfuncon.org and check

53:33.200 --> 53:39.120
them all out. I also do a podcast with my best friend, Brent. You may know him as Brentalfloss.

53:39.120 --> 53:41.920
We do a show called Trends Like These, where we talk about what's trending on the internet. It

53:41.920 --> 53:47.680
comes out every Monday and Thursday. And Justin, I'm so glad you guys are back, right?

53:49.200 --> 53:54.160
Should be this week, yes. I cannot wait. New episodes of Things I Bought at Sheets. They

53:54.160 --> 53:59.040
went on hiatus for a while while they explored different artistic endeavors, but they're coming

53:59.040 --> 54:05.200
back. So excited. Things I Bought at Sheets with the Z. Go check it out on YouTube. Also,

54:05.200 --> 54:08.560
I've been getting way into Periscope. People should follow me on Periscope. Having a lot of

54:08.560 --> 54:15.520
fun. A lot of fun on Periscope. If you are anywhere near Charleston, West Virginia,

54:16.720 --> 54:25.840
our friend and confidant, John Hodgman, is going to be doing a show in Charleston. If you go to

54:25.840 --> 54:31.200
bit.ly. And this is today. If you're listening this Monday, the 22nd, he's doing it today.

54:31.200 --> 54:38.000
Go to bit.ly forward slash Hodgman WV, and you can get tickets to see Hodgman. They're 30 bucks,

54:38.000 --> 54:42.160
and it's going to be great. I'll be there. Come say hi to both of us, and it's going to be a hoot.

54:42.160 --> 54:47.600
Bit.ly forward slash Hodgman WV. Do you guys want that final?

54:47.600 --> 54:52.640
Yeah. We hit you with it. It was sent in by Zoe Kinski. Oh, scaling that ladder. So close to the

54:52.640 --> 54:57.280
top. She'll get there. It's going to happen. Thank you, Zoe. It's by Yahoo Answers user,

54:58.240 --> 55:04.160
Danny, who asks, an anime that will make my dad cry?

55:06.640 --> 55:11.040
I'm Justin McElroy. I'm Travis McElroy. I'm Griffin McElroy. This has been my brother,

55:11.040 --> 55:23.520
and my brother may kiss your dad square on the lips.

55:41.280 --> 55:46.480
I'm Dan McCoy. I'm Stuart Wellington. And I'm Elliot Kalin. What is The Flophouse,

55:46.480 --> 55:50.160
you may very well ask? We watch a bad movie, and then we talk about it.

55:50.160 --> 55:54.000
A bad movie podcast? Isn't that like every fifth podcast on the internet?

55:54.000 --> 55:57.680
I'd answer that by saying, one, we've been doing this show for over seven years,

55:57.680 --> 56:03.520
long before the entire premise of our show was a cliche, and two, shut up. Sick burn.

56:03.520 --> 56:08.640
I'd say that our show is more of a comedy podcast, a podcast about words that sound like other words,

56:08.640 --> 56:13.280
a podcast about me singing long, irritating songs like this one,

56:13.280 --> 56:18.480
a podcast about pitches for a Ziggy comic book movie or discussions about sex tarps.

56:18.480 --> 56:22.000
Yeah, I mean, mostly it's a show about three friends just hanging out

56:22.560 --> 56:25.120
and talking about ding dongs. That's mostly used to.

56:25.120 --> 56:27.760
Wait, what? So if you like any of those things,

56:27.760 --> 56:33.760
subscribe in iTunes today or visit MaximumFun.org to follow the show.

56:33.760 --> 56:39.760
