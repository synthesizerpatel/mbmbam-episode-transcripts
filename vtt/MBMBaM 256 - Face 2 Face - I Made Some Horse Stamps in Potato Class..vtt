WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
Okay, please welcome to the stage your friends and mine, the McElroy brothers, my brother, my brother and me.

00:30.000 --> 00:46.000
And if I show for the modern era like Chilean miners, we've emerged here on the stage of X Fun Con. I'm so excited to be here. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
I'm your middle brother, Travis McElroy.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
We can't wait for your applause. We got too many goofs to give you.

00:56.000 --> 01:00.000
We gotta throw all our entourage material out there.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
I can't do it. I can't do it.

01:05.000 --> 01:10.000
I cannot believe, Jesse, you gave us the hangover slot again.

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
Three times we have Dumbass Fun Con.

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
Every year, 10 a.m.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
10 a.m. we get the hangover slot.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
Sunday at 10 a.m.

01:21.000 --> 01:27.000
Jesse knows, he throws us into the briar patch on an annual basis.

01:27.000 --> 01:33.000
Much like everyone Eminem interacts with in the movie 8 Mile, he knows that adversity is gonna make us strong.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
So this year we just leaned into it.

01:35.000 --> 01:42.000
Yeah, this is, by the way, my brother, my brother and me, face-to-face live 16.

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
He ain't funny, he's my brother.

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
This is a PowerPoint presentation that I have prepared to go along with the show.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
Justin, I will tear for you.

01:54.000 --> 01:58.000
It's a special PowerPoint presentation just for the right side of the audience.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
Sorry, left side.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
Ah, man, you're missing some classic shit.

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
Justin wrote some words on some paper.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
So we're doing the hangover slot again.

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
Does anybody have, stepping outside the bit here for a minute, let's get real.

02:10.000 --> 02:14.000
Anybody having ibuprofen in the bottle?

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
I need to see you take it out of the ibuprofen bottle.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
Is it in the ibuprofen bottle?

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
If it's a ziplock bag.

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
Oh, like a ziplock bag can be sealed?

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
Oh, tamper proof, that is ideal.

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
Yes, wonderful.

02:30.000 --> 02:35.000
Griffin has brought us back around to one of the treacherous parts about doing the hangover slot.

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
Is that it's not just the audience that is very hungover.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
It is also the performers.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
Oh my god, thank you so much.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
Do you know what's your name?

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
Susie.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
You've saved the show.

02:49.000 --> 02:56.000
Travis, I was wondering, I'll stand up and fan away for you if you could walk me through the rules of doing the hangover slot.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
You got it.

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
This is an advice show, by the way, in case you couldn't guess.

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
Has anybody not listened to the show before?

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
Now hold on, Justin, hold on.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
There's just one person, okay, thank god.

03:06.000 --> 03:12.000
If we ever ask that question and nobody yells, then we just ascend into the hangover.

03:12.000 --> 03:16.000
Okay, so this is rule number one of the hangover show.

03:16.000 --> 03:19.000
Be cool.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
I hope one of these, hold on, I have a pill in my mouth.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
What am I doing?

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
That's what we do here.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
We drink champagne, we take drugs.

03:27.000 --> 03:31.000
I hope one of these rules is don't yell or clap.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
Okay, Jay Town.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
You could file that under being cool.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
It's not cool to clap or laugh very loud.

03:37.000 --> 03:41.000
Okay, rule number two.

03:41.000 --> 03:45.000
Yeah, you were doing so good with two hands that you thought...

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
Rule number two.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
Rule number two is come on, come on.

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
So this one's more of a punitive statute.

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
Yeah, and once you've forgotten rule number one, be cool.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
And then you get to rule number two, come on.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
Come on, we're in the hangover slot.

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
Okay, rule number three.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
He's doing it.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
Nice, nice.

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
So this one is a bit more congratulatory.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
You've done it.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
At the end, you're packing up your bag and you're thinking, nice.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
Nice.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
I really follow those rules those guys gave me.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
Is there more?

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
Oh, here's the thing.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
To embrace the hangover nature of this show,

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
we didn't pull any email questions.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
We're going to do all audience questions.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
Yeah.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
So rule number four.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
How about for being in a briar patch?

04:31.000 --> 04:37.000
Yeah, and remember, no bummer questions.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
Why did you...

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
Hold on, no, don't clap for this.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
Don't clap for this.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
You have struck through.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
Don't clap for the slide of the PowerPoint presentation.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
No, that's like a no with a slap.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
So they're like, oh, that...

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
There's a no sign.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
Okay, so left side of the audience.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
Left side and maybe a few people who can't see

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
because they're listening to a podcast.

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
There may be one or two of them that are in the room physically.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
It says no bummer questions,

04:58.000 --> 05:02.000
but the word no has the strike through no sign around it.

05:02.000 --> 05:06.000
I swear to God, if you just sullied the show with bummer questions,

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
if you just flooded the field...

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
It's iconography.

05:09.000 --> 05:13.000
Now they can look at it and be like, oh, I remember the no.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
Oh, my God.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
So this actually...

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
If you remember one thing from this show, it's no.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
We have given you guys like 260 hours

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
of free entertainment content at this point.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
Can we just have one Jimmy episode

05:27.000 --> 05:31.000
where we just sit here in absolute silence?

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
Everybody put your heads down.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
We're going to turn Jumanji on.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
Yeah.

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
Like in school, when the teacher doesn't want to teach that day,

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
it's a Jumanji day.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
Could you put on the first hour of Jumanji?

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
Just play Jumanji?

05:44.000 --> 05:48.000
Nick, if you could just play Aladdin in Spanish

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
because that's a Spanish class.

05:51.000 --> 05:55.000
How about instead we jump into things with the yahooing?

05:55.000 --> 05:59.000
Oh, in case you're worried about the show being bad, don't worry.

05:59.000 --> 06:04.000
As you fail us, we have some bulletproof show savers

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
that we will tear in case of mediocrity.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
These are going to save the show if things go wrong.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
Can we pivot the fucking board

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
towards the left side of the audience at all?

06:12.000 --> 06:16.000
We can turn it flat, but then nobody gets it.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
You're going to knock that over?

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
You're going to break a speaker?

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
That's show saver five.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
I'd ruin the stage.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
How about this yahoo?

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
Yeah.

06:25.000 --> 06:29.000
Sometimes we read yahoo answers on the show from the internet

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
that mainly two people in the audience...

06:32.000 --> 06:36.000
And this is not...

06:36.000 --> 06:40.000
I'm talking, of course, about Drew Davenport and Rachel Sperling.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
You guys can stand up.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
Get your accolades.

06:42.000 --> 06:49.000
Drink it in.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
Drew's the one with the beard.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
Yeah.

06:51.000 --> 06:55.000
Last night at the Purple Party,

06:55.000 --> 07:00.000
I literally saw those two having a rap battle

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
with a circle around them,

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
but they were just reading funny things off their phones

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
that they had dug up.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
And like screaming at each other.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
Like, oh, get this one.

07:10.000 --> 07:14.000
Okay, Griffin, read a question for the yahoo answer service

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
that we will then answer.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
All right.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
I'm going to go to Drew first.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
Drew Davenport sent this one in.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
Level 9000.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
Yeah, Drew Shaman.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
Drew Davenport, thank you.

07:22.000 --> 07:27.000
It's by a anonymous user who asks,

07:27.000 --> 07:35.000
where would parents hide condoms?

07:35.000 --> 07:39.000
Recently, I've been hearing my parents in the bedroom at night.

07:39.000 --> 07:47.000
I want to find their condoms to embarrass them.

07:47.000 --> 07:51.000
I've searched their room and their bathroom

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
anywhere I should look or double check.

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
These kids are real encyclopedia brown.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
So precocious.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
It all makes sense when you realize this was their first kid.

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
So yeah, I bet they use a lot of protection.

08:04.000 --> 08:08.000
Everybody's got a hollowed out book, right?

08:08.000 --> 08:13.000
That they hide all their Jimmy caps in.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
You got grossed out by the term Jimmy caps?

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
Jim was literally handing out a trash bag full of condoms

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
before the show.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
And you all are like, hmm, slang terms?

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
No, thank you.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
It's right there.

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
There's a giant bag of condoms circling the audience.

08:26.000 --> 08:31.000
I like the one condom that comes in the gift bag.

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
Because that says to me, you're going to be somebody special,

08:34.000 --> 08:38.000
and it's not going to go great enough that you want to go together.

08:38.000 --> 08:42.000
It's a real one off.

08:42.000 --> 08:46.000
This is how, oh man, how old, how young can you be

08:46.000 --> 08:50.000
to do this level of a power move on your parents?

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
Because you are the dad.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
What's up, Bryce?

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
Now I'm the dad.

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
I'll be going to work from now on.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
It's hard though, if you do it too young,

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
you could end up in a blank check situation

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
where you are too young to take care of yourself.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
Is that what happened in blank check?

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
He became the dad of his family?

09:10.000 --> 09:14.000
He found his dad's condoms, fucking made them rain on him.

09:14.000 --> 09:19.000
I said give me a million dollars or I'll tell everyone.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
You don't want this to get out, do you, dads?

09:21.000 --> 09:28.000
You have safe sex with your wife.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
The world will know.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
Where do parents hide?

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
Where's a cool place for parents to hide things?

09:36.000 --> 09:39.000
The best place to hide anything is the last place someone would expect.

09:39.000 --> 09:44.000
So I bet they hide their condoms on their penis.

09:44.000 --> 09:47.000
You'd think that would be the first place someone would look.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
I would get rigorous about it.

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
I would take 30 paces from the back door.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
There's an old oak tree.

09:54.000 --> 09:58.000
Oh man, I'm so ready to make love to you, Sheila.

09:58.000 --> 10:02.000
It's going to be so great and hot and sweaty.

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
I need 20 minutes, I need to go out to the shed.

10:05.000 --> 10:13.000
I just got to go geocache some condoms real quick.

10:13.000 --> 10:17.000
I would have a safe with a scanner and those lasers.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
A painting hanging over it.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
Lasers that you have to climb through,

10:20.000 --> 10:24.000
but you could do it in a sexy way that would heighten the mood.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
Wait, hold on. Stop.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
This is just for you people in the room.

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
Justin, show them sexy once more.

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
It's like that scene from Entrapment.

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
He looks like he has no bones.

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
Got some Entrapment fans in the audience.

10:40.000 --> 10:44.000
Could you hide it inside of the painting covering the safe?

10:44.000 --> 10:51.000
Whoa, and you have to enter the painting like it's Super Mario?

10:51.000 --> 10:56.000
The condoms are buried in Bob-omb's Battlefield under the chain chomps.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
That's why the ghost is covering its eyes.

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
Yeah, because I want to see.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
Sex is beautiful and natural.

11:03.000 --> 11:06.000
That's a new man running through Super Mario World.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
Clever condoms.

11:08.000 --> 11:11.000
Justin, could you do the first show saver, please?

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
Do we need it?

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
Shit, I thought we were doing all right.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
Let's ask the audience.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
No, not for a question, Dimitri.

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
Though I like your spirit.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
Can we wait on the show?

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
Let's see how bad Dimitri's question is.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
Dimitri, come on up.

11:29.000 --> 11:33.000
Welcome, Dimitri.

11:33.000 --> 11:37.000
I need a verbal confirmation that you understand the rules of engagement.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
No bummers.

11:39.000 --> 11:42.000
Is the mic hot?

11:42.000 --> 11:45.000
Blow into them.

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
Is that what Tom was talking about in his podcast last?

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
Always blow into your mic.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
It's the best quality you can do.

11:52.000 --> 11:57.000
Me and my boyfriend have been together for three and change years.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
We've been together for a while, too.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
We're trying to figure things out.

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
It's about the next step, but neither one of us...

12:04.000 --> 12:08.000
We cannot find a formula to decide which of us is supposed to propose.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
This is easy.

12:10.000 --> 12:14.000
We would both like to be the one that does not propose.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
That's the twist.

12:16.000 --> 12:19.000
I was going to say simultaneous proposals.

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
You each get down on one knee, opposite knees.

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
You tie your legs together.

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
That's a three-legged race.

12:28.000 --> 12:34.000
This could be an amazing business opportunity for me.

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
I am pretty good at proposing.

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
I think I did a pretty good job.

12:40.000 --> 12:44.000
A surrogate proposer for just this situation.

12:44.000 --> 12:48.000
A third party that will come in and surprise you at Lowe's.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
Maybe you're shopping for...

12:51.000 --> 12:56.000
You go to Lowe's and you get all the stuff you put in the house.

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
All the things you put in the house.

12:59.000 --> 13:02.000
Windows, doors, walls.

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
Your partner is like, what are you doing?

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
Why are you getting all these things?

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
This is for the house and the wife.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
That's a proposal.

13:13.000 --> 13:16.000
Did you not understand the fucking question?

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
It's super romantic.

13:18.000 --> 13:21.000
You're going to fill a cart with a house.

13:21.000 --> 13:25.000
Then you hand it off to your stunt double, Griffin.

13:25.000 --> 13:28.000
He steps in and does the heavy lifting.

13:28.000 --> 13:31.000
You say the thing I say, then you stare silently.

13:31.000 --> 13:34.000
You call Griffin and tell him you're ready.

13:34.000 --> 13:37.000
He wakes up and takes a shower and gets dressed.

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
Then drives to where you are and then doesn't.

13:40.000 --> 13:45.000
You have to stand in silence the whole time with just a house in your cart.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
I would do a good job.

13:47.000 --> 13:52.000
Would anybody here trust me to propose for them in a way that felt right for them?

13:52.000 --> 13:55.000
We would need to do a thorough interview.

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
No, no, no. These are jokes.

13:58.000 --> 14:01.000
At least I'm not going to do this right now.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
No, no, no.

14:03.000 --> 14:06.000
What the fuck?

14:06.000 --> 14:09.000
No, you guys are bad.

14:09.000 --> 14:14.000
We ain't doing this.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
No, we can do it if you want.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
Be cool.

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
We're not getting into another goddamn Milwaukee situation.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
We've got a full blown walkie.

14:23.000 --> 14:28.000
People waffled on a proposal for 45 minutes and I was trapped in a Hellraiser experience.

14:28.000 --> 14:33.000
But yeah, I think that works for you. Did we do it good?

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
Yeah, you did a great job.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
Cool.

14:37.000 --> 14:40.000
Thank you, Denitri.

14:40.000 --> 14:46.000
You doing one on the ripcord?

14:46.000 --> 14:51.000
I don't know what these are going to be.

14:51.000 --> 14:57.000
I just want to say some shit about those two horses.

14:57.000 --> 15:01.000
People seem to like that and I want to play the favorites here.

15:01.000 --> 15:05.000
One time my parents saw Gordon Lightfoot and the first thing he says is,

15:05.000 --> 15:09.000
while I haven't announced it to everybody, I will not be playing the wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald.

15:09.000 --> 15:12.000
And half the audience still opened their eyes.

15:12.000 --> 15:15.000
No, Gordon, that's what we wanted. It came to here, my friend.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
What does that have to do with... Oh, I get it.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
Oh, I see.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
Play the hits.

15:20.000 --> 15:24.000
You're saying Ghosts and Horses is our wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald.

15:24.000 --> 15:29.000
So, here's my question. Has anybody experienced any paranormal activity since they've been here?

15:29.000 --> 15:32.000
Or equestral activity?

15:32.000 --> 15:39.000
Or the rare paranormal slash equestral activity, Equestrian, right?

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
Dammit.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
No takers.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.000
Right there.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
Did you see a ghost?

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
No, but I made some horse stamps.

15:46.000 --> 15:50.000
You made horse stamps into stamps.

15:50.000 --> 15:55.000
That's the best sentence I've ever heard anybody say, ever.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
What was the sentence, Griffin?

15:57.000 --> 16:05.000
I made some horse stamps in potato class.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
Yeah, throw it up here.

16:06.000 --> 16:12.000
This is the greatest camp of all time. Get on up here.

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
Oh, shit. God, he's fucking...

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
That's a good... That's a good...

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
Will you just say that sentence out loud again?

16:19.000 --> 16:26.000
I made some horse stamps in potato class.

16:26.000 --> 16:30.000
I don't think we've ever had a full sentence be the title of the episode before.

16:30.000 --> 16:33.000
So, this is very exciting for me.

16:33.000 --> 16:37.000
I made a card with some of the, like, secondary impressions.

16:37.000 --> 16:42.000
So, the first one is, like, the brightest, and then it gets lighter as the...

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
As the potato degrades.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
As the potato quality diminishes.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
The half blushes.

16:46.000 --> 16:50.000
And so, I made one with the secondary impressions.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
Looks like ghost horses.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
I'll get it out of my bag for you later.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
Oh, terrific. I'm very much looking forward to that.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
One more time. Just stop. Wait, just one more time.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
Can you say that wonderful sentence?

16:59.000 --> 17:04.000
Can you cast that spell on me just one more time?

17:04.000 --> 17:13.000
Say the sentence, and then say your name after it like you're quoting yourself.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
I made some potato stamps.

17:15.000 --> 17:19.000
No shit!

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
Try again. I can do it.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

17:21.000 --> 17:29.000
I am cool with, I made some potato stamps in horse class.

17:29.000 --> 17:32.000
I made some horse stamps in potato class.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
Bailey Curran.

17:34.000 --> 17:37.000
Nice.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
Well done.

17:39.000 --> 17:43.000
Thank you.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.000
Should we do a Yahoo?

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
Oh, this fits in very nicely.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
This is another Davenport jam.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
Smooth transition.

17:49.000 --> 17:55.000
Neighbor child.

17:55.000 --> 18:00.000
I tweeted before the show that I needed more Yahoos, and Drew tweeted back,

18:00.000 --> 18:03.000
I'll just hand you some.

18:03.000 --> 18:07.000
Thank you, Drew. It's by Yahoo Answers user, Lane, who asks,

18:07.000 --> 18:16.000
Are there any lawyers that deal with spiritual and mentophysical crime?

18:16.000 --> 18:22.000
I know there is no information to be found anywhere, and they don't burn witches anymore,

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
so what's the replacement?

18:23.000 --> 18:26.000
Thanks, Obama.

18:26.000 --> 18:34.000
Or did we just give up to a decent meal and carnal creature comforts as the best and safest life can be?

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
Wow.

18:36.000 --> 18:39.000
I didn't read that part before it.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
Are we not safe enough?

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
I feel pretty safe on a day-to-day basis.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
Have you taken any preparations?

18:44.000 --> 18:47.000
Against mentophysical crime?

18:47.000 --> 18:52.000
No, the first step in that preparation process would be Googling what the fuck that is.

18:52.000 --> 19:02.000
But, Griffin, what if your house gets robbed by a Boogler?

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
Oh, that's really good.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
Hey, Chad. Hey, Chad.

19:05.000 --> 19:10.000
Oh, no, I need a minute.

19:10.000 --> 19:20.000
How would his spectral hands even grasp my belongings, checkmates?

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
That's a good point, though.

19:21.000 --> 19:24.000
They caught him dead-handed.

19:24.000 --> 19:29.000
Shit, damn.

19:29.000 --> 19:34.000
This is going to be a Travis episode.

19:34.000 --> 19:38.000
I owe Jesse Sid everything, and I did a very good job.

19:38.000 --> 19:42.000
I definitely got the right performers for my convention.

19:42.000 --> 19:45.000
Listen, these are a talent group.

19:45.000 --> 19:48.000
Did you hear the thing that one said about Booglers?

19:48.000 --> 19:51.000
Hey, I'm writing that down.

19:51.000 --> 19:54.000
I'll never know when I might need a joke like that.

19:54.000 --> 19:58.000
Travis, come on.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
You're right.

19:59.000 --> 20:02.000
If you get haunted, though,

20:02.000 --> 20:09.000
if you get car-crashed by a ghost driver, there's no recourse.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
That's true.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
There's no special courts or anything.

20:12.000 --> 20:15.000
Would the lawyer slash judge slash jury

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
also need to be a ghost?

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
Yes.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
Yes, for real, for sure.

20:18.000 --> 20:21.000
I feel like a jury of your peers would have to be a ghost.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
Yeah, jury of your peers would have to be a ghost.

20:23.000 --> 20:26.000
Near-death experience, though, I think is the least you can ask for.

20:26.000 --> 20:29.000
Oh, so like a judge who's been dead for like a minute.

20:29.000 --> 20:32.000
Wait, wait, wait, wait, shh, shh, shh.

20:32.000 --> 20:36.000
But they're all ghosts because the jury was hanged?

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
That's nothing.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
Fucking forget it.

20:38.000 --> 20:42.000
No, I got jealous of Travis and I...

20:42.000 --> 20:45.000
Who can blame you?

20:45.000 --> 20:48.000
He does great jokes.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
It's not fair.

20:49.000 --> 20:55.000
I was so drunk eight hours ago.

20:55.000 --> 21:00.000
How could you do this to me?

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
Should we get someone else up here to ask a question?

21:02.000 --> 21:05.000
Yeah.

21:05.000 --> 21:08.000
I can see this hand first.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
Whoever wants to walk up to the stage.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
First person to stand up, first person.

21:11.000 --> 21:16.000
Yay!

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
God, these seats are so close together,

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
we should have thought about this better.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
Hello?

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
First, what is your name?

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
My name is Solomon.

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
Hi, Solomon.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
I've never talked into a microphone before.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
Oh, get up first.

21:30.000 --> 21:33.000
It doesn't stop us.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
Solomon, we need verbal confirmation

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
that you understand the rules.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
Yeah, no bummers.

21:37.000 --> 21:40.000
No bummers.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
So I have a Patreon.

21:42.000 --> 21:45.000
I run a Patreon where I make comics and art and stuff.

21:45.000 --> 21:48.000
And so, you know, Patreon works.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
Yeah, for sure.

21:49.000 --> 21:52.000
Okay, so I have rewards that go up to $25

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
and you get like comics in the mail.

21:54.000 --> 21:55.000
Sold.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
So what's like the next tier?

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
Above comics?

21:59.000 --> 22:00.000
No, above $25.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
More comics, double comics.

22:02.000 --> 22:05.000
I gotta blow their minds and get their money.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
For how much money?

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
That's it, that's up to us.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
More than $25.

22:10.000 --> 22:13.000
What's more than $25?

22:13.000 --> 22:16.000
For $25, you send them some comics.

22:16.000 --> 22:20.000
For $25 million, you make them a blockbuster movie.

22:20.000 --> 22:26.000
No, you buy them a blockbuster video.

22:26.000 --> 22:32.000
Can you do, for $50, two comics?

22:32.000 --> 22:35.000
For $50, they can send you comics.

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
The best gift you could give,

22:37.000 --> 22:41.000
the best thing you could do is give a gift that everybody wants

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
but they would never purchase for themselves

22:43.000 --> 22:47.000
and ask exact sticker price for the donation.

22:47.000 --> 22:50.000
So by which I mean $25 gets you some comics,

22:50.000 --> 22:56.000
$5,297.99 is gonna get you a Kawasaki jet ski.

22:56.000 --> 23:02.000
So you're suggesting that you use Patreon to...

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
Launder.

23:03.000 --> 23:06.000
Sell speedboats.

23:06.000 --> 23:11.000
Ooh, okay, for $50, you'll give them $30.

23:11.000 --> 23:14.000
If I saw that, I wouldn't be able to pass it off.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
That's free $30 right there.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
I do need the money.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
I lost my cloud two weeks ago.

23:20.000 --> 23:23.000
I'm gonna send that $50.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
Is this a Ponzi scheme?

23:25.000 --> 23:29.000
I don't know what that is.

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
What's the comic about, can I ask?

23:31.000 --> 23:35.000
Oh, the main comic is a porn comic.

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
Fantastic.

23:37.000 --> 23:41.000
We're four minutes into this question.

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
I make other kinds of comics too.

23:43.000 --> 23:46.000
Not interested, thank you.

23:46.000 --> 23:52.000
Can you include them in your sex comics at a certain, like $100?

23:52.000 --> 23:55.000
But not participate, just as a spectator runs my body.

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
Wait, wait, wait, include them in your sex comics

23:57.000 --> 24:01.000
but make them look 10% sexier than they do in real life.

24:01.000 --> 24:02.000
Naked.

24:02.000 --> 24:05.000
Then, when you are trying to woo someone,

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
you say, oh, I've got a comic book in which I'm depicted naked,

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
would you like to see that?

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
But the ding dong is bigger or something?

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
The butt looks bigger in the comic

24:13.000 --> 24:16.000
and then they think your ding dong is real big.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.000
Foolproof.

24:17.000 --> 24:21.000
You're saying, you're trying to make a connection,

24:21.000 --> 24:24.000
an intimate, a skintimate connection with somebody.

24:24.000 --> 24:28.000
You say, I am literature for you.

24:28.000 --> 24:33.000
And then I need you to sign this NDA.

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
I think we helped.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
I think, did we do it?

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
Does that help?

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
Yeah, definitely.

24:37.000 --> 24:38.000
Thank you.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
Wait, wait, wait, do you want to plug your Patreon really quick

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
because you didn't give anybody any way to find it.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
Yeah, my Patreon is just my name,

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
all one word, Solomon Fletcher,

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
and the comic is called Goldie and the Bears,

24:48.000 --> 24:49.000
like Goldilocks.

24:49.000 --> 24:50.000
There it is.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
With dudes.

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
Enjoy.

24:52.000 --> 24:53.000
Fuck yeah.

24:53.000 --> 24:54.000
Nice.

24:57.000 --> 25:01.000
That was the original premise of our podcast.

25:01.000 --> 25:05.000
It was critically reviled.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
Should we do a show saver?

25:06.000 --> 25:09.000
Yeah, let's do a show saver.

25:09.000 --> 25:14.000
Show saver number two.

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
Show saver two is ask people to cheer

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
for previous Max Fun Con performers

25:18.000 --> 25:21.000
in the hopes that they will mingle the memories of the shows

25:21.000 --> 25:24.000
and will look back on your show somewhat fondly.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
Let's hear it for SuperEgo.

25:26.000 --> 25:32.000
My brother and me think about us now.

25:32.000 --> 25:35.000
Don't clap, just think about us.

25:35.000 --> 25:38.000
How about those stand up comedians last night, right?

25:38.000 --> 25:41.000
Us, us, us.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
You enjoyed yourselves.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
You had a good time at the podcast.

25:45.000 --> 25:49.000
International Waters, am I right?

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
There is only my brother and my brother and me.

25:51.000 --> 25:54.000
There is only my brother and my brother and me.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
Let's hear it for my brother and my brother.

25:56.000 --> 25:57.000
No, wait, fuck.

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
You fucked it up.

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
Shit.

25:59.000 --> 26:02.000
Did you enjoy your classes?

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
You learned much more from my brother and me.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
You learned more at our show.

26:06.000 --> 26:11.000
I made a horse stamp a potato class.

26:11.000 --> 26:12.000
Well, that was from before.

26:12.000 --> 26:13.000
We do own that one.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
We did actually do that one.

26:15.000 --> 26:18.000
So remember that one if you want.

26:18.000 --> 26:34.000
We're going to take a quick break to talk about our sponsors this week.

26:34.000 --> 26:37.000
We're sponsored by MeUndies, a friend of the show.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.000
They've sponsored us a couple of times.

26:38.000 --> 26:39.000
We love them.

26:39.000 --> 26:40.000
Hopefully you know about it by now.

26:40.000 --> 26:43.000
Hopefully you've seen all the pictures of me online wearing it.

26:43.000 --> 26:44.000
Anytime you see a picture of anybody...

26:44.000 --> 26:45.000
I'm wearing them right now.

26:45.000 --> 26:49.000
Anytime you see a picture of anybody online wearing MeUndies, that's my butt and my body.

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
MeUndies is dedicated to offering the most comfortable underwear.

26:51.000 --> 26:54.000
But here's the thing, MeUndies isn't just for guys.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
They just launched their All of Me women's collection.

26:56.000 --> 26:59.000
It's a four piece line of undies designed specifically for the female body.

26:59.000 --> 27:02.000
In all of its complex, gorgeous as hell glory.

27:02.000 --> 27:07.000
Again, I thought that maybe it would be more comfortable for me to hear you say that the second time.

27:07.000 --> 27:08.000
It got less.

27:08.000 --> 27:11.000
It actually aged in a peculiar way.

27:11.000 --> 27:15.000
Next time we just need to hire someone to come in and read that part.

27:15.000 --> 27:16.000
Just that part.

27:16.000 --> 27:17.000
Who do you think?

27:17.000 --> 27:18.000
Like Zac Efron?

27:18.000 --> 27:19.000
Maybe Zac Efron.

27:19.000 --> 27:22.000
To get 20% off, you can go to MeUndies.com slash my brother.

27:22.000 --> 27:25.000
That's MeUndies.com slash my brother.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
It's totally worth it.

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
You should already be doing this right now.

27:29.000 --> 27:32.000
I'm ashamed of you that you haven't done it yet.

27:32.000 --> 27:37.000
Travis, if you had a powerful hunger right now, what would be an arm's reach for you to consume?

27:37.000 --> 27:38.000
Oh, that would be MeUndies.

27:38.000 --> 27:39.000
No.

27:39.000 --> 27:40.000
Well, I mean you could eat...

27:40.000 --> 27:41.000
Oh, sorry.

27:41.000 --> 27:42.000
Nature Fuck.

27:42.000 --> 27:43.000
The closest you see where you're going with that.

27:43.000 --> 27:44.000
You're not a goat.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
You've actually got this bowl of four limes here.

27:46.000 --> 27:47.000
And I want...

27:47.000 --> 27:48.000
No, those are decorative.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.000
This is your centerpiece.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
It's a big, big bowl just to set the stage.

27:51.000 --> 27:54.000
A big, big, big glass bowl with four little limes in it.

27:54.000 --> 27:58.000
Well, to give you an idea Griffin, Theresa and I challenged ourselves and we bought a whole like four pound bag of limes.

27:58.000 --> 27:59.000
That's all that's left.

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
Oh, a lime dare.

28:01.000 --> 28:10.000
But sitting right next to me to my immediate right is Nature Box from Parmesan Garlic Pop Pops and some Pistachio Power Clusters, which are my new favorite snack.

28:10.000 --> 28:11.000
Absolutely delicious.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
They're sponsoring us this week.

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
They're made with zero artificial flavors.

28:15.000 --> 28:16.000
They're Nature Box.

28:16.000 --> 28:17.000
What?

28:17.000 --> 28:18.000
Nature Box.

28:18.000 --> 28:19.000
You see Nature Box?

28:19.000 --> 28:20.000
Not Pistachio Power Clusters.

28:20.000 --> 28:23.000
They've got zero grams of trans fat and no high fructose corn syrup.

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
That stuff's bad, I think.

28:25.000 --> 28:29.000
You can grab mini Belgian waffles, strawberry lemonade fruit stars.

28:29.000 --> 28:30.000
How many?

28:30.000 --> 28:31.000
Sweet and salty.

28:31.000 --> 28:32.000
What?

28:32.000 --> 28:33.000
How many Belgian waffles?

28:33.000 --> 28:34.000
Mini Belgian waffles.

28:34.000 --> 28:41.000
If you go to naturebox.com slash my brother, you can get a free trial box of their favorite snacks.

28:41.000 --> 28:42.000
That's pretty great.

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
I assume at this point we're just like preaching.

28:44.000 --> 28:45.000
Everybody's going, yeah, I know.

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
I'm already subscribed to Nature Box.

28:47.000 --> 28:48.000
I know.

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
I'm eating them now.

28:49.000 --> 28:52.000
I've got tight sexual underwear stuffed with Pistachio Power Clusters.

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
Who's this next message for?

28:54.000 --> 28:57.000
I've got a message here for...

28:57.000 --> 29:00.000
I have a message here for Joe Zabadoo.

29:00.000 --> 29:01.000
My keyboard is...

29:01.000 --> 29:02.000
No, just kidding.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
It's RJ Zamudio.

29:04.000 --> 29:07.000
RJ Zamudio, this message is for you, pal.

29:07.000 --> 29:10.000
And it's from Mitch Bones, who says,

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
Sorry that this candle night's gift is so late.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.000
Yup.

29:13.000 --> 29:17.000
I debated on this or a miniature adult hippo in a small cage.

29:17.000 --> 29:22.000
I was going to blame this being late on the brothers, but I just now got around to it.

29:22.000 --> 29:26.000
Thanks so much for being my best friend before this.

29:26.000 --> 29:27.000
No, I added that.

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
He just said best friend.

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
If you didn't know, you were my best friend.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
Well, you are now because it's canon.

29:33.000 --> 29:37.000
P.S. Shout out to Catland and Travis.

29:37.000 --> 29:38.000
And then he died.

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
And then he died while I was typing.

29:40.000 --> 29:43.000
It sounded like maybe you had only one letter to go.

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
Isn't it ironic?

29:45.000 --> 29:49.000
We have one more message for Em from B.

29:49.000 --> 29:52.000
Just says, Happy birthday, sweet cheese.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
This is so mysterious.

29:54.000 --> 29:57.000
Do you know how off the grid you have to be before you're...

29:57.000 --> 30:05.000
Of the two people in a relationship, the only letters you're allowed to slip out are E and M and a B.

30:05.000 --> 30:06.000
Yeah.

30:06.000 --> 30:07.000
That's really off the grid.

30:07.000 --> 30:08.000
These are some double agent...

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
This is some 007 secret agent shit though, right?

30:10.000 --> 30:11.000
Oh, yeah, yeah.

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
We're going to get another one from B to M.

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
It's like the crow flies at midnight.

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
Oh, BM.

30:17.000 --> 30:18.000
BM, guys.

30:18.000 --> 30:23.000
Before we go back to the show real quick, we just wanted to say a quick thank you to Maximum Fun for having us at Max Fun Con.

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
We do that in the show there later.

30:25.000 --> 30:26.000
I know, but I want to say it now.

30:26.000 --> 30:27.000
Okay.

30:27.000 --> 30:32.000
Everybody who came out, everybody who made the show possible, Lake Arrowhead for being so incredibly great.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
And yeah, it was just a super fun weekend.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
And thanks for inviting us, Max Fun.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.000
Yeah.

30:37.000 --> 30:41.000
So when sales go up for Maximum Fun 2016, get your tickets.

30:41.000 --> 30:42.000
Get your tickets.

30:42.000 --> 30:43.000
Get there.

30:43.000 --> 30:44.000
If you've never been before, you need to go.

30:44.000 --> 30:45.000
It's like the most fun thing.

30:45.000 --> 30:46.000
It sells out instantaneously.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
So do not sleep.

30:48.000 --> 30:49.000
Okay.

30:49.000 --> 30:50.000
Back to the show.

30:50.000 --> 30:51.000
Oh, man.

30:51.000 --> 30:52.000
This is good.

30:52.000 --> 30:53.000
Hey, Max Fun listeners.

30:53.000 --> 30:54.000
I'm Dave Holmes.

30:54.000 --> 30:57.000
And if you've been missing my show, International Waters, you've been missing this.

30:57.000 --> 31:00.000
I am aroused, but I have zero idea.

31:00.000 --> 31:01.000
Really?

31:01.000 --> 31:02.000
Are you really?

31:02.000 --> 31:03.000
Yeah.

31:03.000 --> 31:04.000
Sorry.

31:04.000 --> 31:05.000
Name a British food lady.

31:05.000 --> 31:06.000
Name a British food lady.

31:06.000 --> 31:07.000
Julia Childs.

31:07.000 --> 31:08.000
I'm afraid I can't accept that.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.000
No, it was not Julia.

31:09.000 --> 31:10.000
No.

31:10.000 --> 31:11.000
Come on.

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
You must know your British food ladies.

31:13.000 --> 31:19.000
International Waters, a panel show where US and UK comedians battle for pop culture supremacy.

31:19.000 --> 31:24.000
Subscribe right now on iTunes or at MaximumFun.org.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.000
Hey, guys.

31:25.000 --> 31:26.000
I have a Yahoo answer.

31:26.000 --> 31:27.000
Okay.

31:27.000 --> 31:28.000
And it was sent in by Zoe Kinsey.

31:28.000 --> 31:29.000
Thank you, Zoe Kinsey.

31:29.000 --> 31:30.000
Loud and loud.

31:30.000 --> 31:37.000
It was asked by Yahoo Answers user SC-MHM.

31:37.000 --> 31:45.000
And that chemical compound asks, what is a good comeback when somebody tells you to stick

31:45.000 --> 31:48.000
your head in gravy?

31:48.000 --> 31:52.000
Best answer.

31:52.000 --> 31:58.000
If it's a chick, just say, I didn't know you were into food play.

31:58.000 --> 32:03.000
Then go stick your little head in gravy and have a good time with her.

32:03.000 --> 32:04.000
Oh, winky face.

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
Why did you decide to read this?

32:06.000 --> 32:09.000
This is the fucking worst two sentences.

32:09.000 --> 32:10.000
No, don't read.

32:10.000 --> 32:11.000
We're not reading the second part.

32:11.000 --> 32:12.000
No, I'm not reading that next one.

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
It is upsetting.

32:14.000 --> 32:17.000
It says the word cock in the second part.

32:17.000 --> 32:18.000
Well, Griffin, come on.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
Let's get start over.

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
I'm going to use my time machine.

32:22.000 --> 32:25.000
So I'll be the only person who's experienced this part so far.

32:25.000 --> 32:26.000
Boop.

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
Why haven't I left?

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
Hey, Chad, what's the best answer?

32:30.000 --> 32:33.000
Oh, the best answer is if it's a chick.

32:33.000 --> 32:39.000
What is a good comeback when somebody tells you to stick your head in gravy?

32:39.000 --> 32:42.000
If somebody says, dip your head in gravy, I just look them straight in the eye and say,

32:42.000 --> 32:43.000
which barrel?

32:43.000 --> 32:46.000
Now, the other thing is I have several barrels of gravy.

32:46.000 --> 32:49.000
Artisanal barrel aged gravy.

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
Just like grandpa used to make.

32:51.000 --> 32:55.000
Our gravy sits in barrels for over 76 years.

32:55.000 --> 33:00.000
Remember that slow walk out to the larder to get some gravy with papa?

33:00.000 --> 33:04.000
Now you can have that great taste in a cellophane package.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
Austin Fawns remembers.

33:06.000 --> 33:10.000
What if you say back to them, what's gravy?

33:10.000 --> 33:13.000
And they're like, it's like super dope.

33:13.000 --> 33:16.000
It's when you mix like milk in with flour and you add spices to it.

33:16.000 --> 33:17.000
And then you say, I got you.

33:17.000 --> 33:20.000
I knew what gravy was before.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
Then you've got the power.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.000
Thank you.

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
Take a bow, Griffin.

33:25.000 --> 33:28.000
Just one of my many pranks.

33:28.000 --> 33:32.000
His classic pretend you don't know what gravy is prank.

33:32.000 --> 33:33.000
Get some every time.

33:33.000 --> 33:36.000
How about, can you just say, no, fuck you.

33:36.000 --> 33:37.000
No.

33:37.000 --> 33:38.000
Go fuck yourself.

33:38.000 --> 33:39.000
No.

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
I would drown and I would hate that.

33:41.000 --> 33:42.000
I think.

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
We had a good drive up here.

33:44.000 --> 33:49.000
It took us five hours from Los Angeles, which is not great.

33:49.000 --> 33:54.000
But we did stop for supplies on the way up the hill.

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
I want to tell you guys this fable.

33:56.000 --> 33:59.000
We stopped at a place called the one stop supermarket.

33:59.000 --> 34:00.000
I want to.

34:00.000 --> 34:01.000
Okay.

34:01.000 --> 34:02.000
I want to interrupt you, Justin.

34:02.000 --> 34:03.000
Okay.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.000
First time ever.

34:04.000 --> 34:07.000
And say, we were going to stop at Jensen's.

34:07.000 --> 34:08.000
Yeah.

34:08.000 --> 34:09.000
Yes.

34:09.000 --> 34:10.000
Hi, Mr. Jensen.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
Thank you for coming to the show.

34:12.000 --> 34:17.000
And we were like, well, we should stop before we get on the mountain because God knows how

34:17.000 --> 34:18.000
long that will take.

34:18.000 --> 34:19.000
Right.

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
And we were going to go to a different supermarket.

34:21.000 --> 34:24.000
And then we were driving by the one stop market.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
And Griffin said like, oh, we can just go there.

34:26.000 --> 34:29.000
And as we're like pulling in, it was like, yeah, this is fine.

34:29.000 --> 34:30.000
It's fine.

34:30.000 --> 34:31.000
It's a supermarket.

34:31.000 --> 34:36.000
I go in and the shelves are just, there's just like things on the shelves.

34:36.000 --> 34:37.000
Like, oh, there's a blanket.

34:37.000 --> 34:38.000
Yeah.

34:38.000 --> 34:41.000
Why is there an unwrapped blanket just lying on the shelf?

34:41.000 --> 34:42.000
But that didn't deter me.

34:42.000 --> 34:43.000
My baby needs food.

34:43.000 --> 34:44.000
I'm a provider.

34:44.000 --> 34:48.000
So I go in there and I get a basket full of baby food, get everything her little tummy

34:48.000 --> 34:49.000
could desire.

34:49.000 --> 34:54.000
And I go up to check out and the gentleman picks up the first container and he stops

34:54.000 --> 34:55.000
and he looks at it.

34:55.000 --> 35:01.000
He says, I do have to tell you, this is baby food and this is expired.

35:01.000 --> 35:06.000
Then he sets it down and picks up the next container, sets it down next to the first

35:06.000 --> 35:07.000
container.

35:07.000 --> 35:15.000
This dude goes through like seven containers of expired baby food, has two that are unexpired

35:15.000 --> 35:20.000
and then looks at me as if our purchasing transaction is going to continue.

35:20.000 --> 35:26.000
At this point, like we have not reached the off ramp for this particular transaction was

35:26.000 --> 35:30.000
back when you told me some of the baby food is expired.

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
Like, well, let me check that date.

35:32.000 --> 35:33.000
Oh, that's that bad boy off.

35:33.000 --> 35:34.000
Let's go to town.

35:34.000 --> 35:37.000
The best part of the story is the line.

35:37.000 --> 35:42.000
Now this is baby food, so I'm going to shoot you straight.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
I'm not going to screw you over on this one.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
This will kill a baby for sure.

35:46.000 --> 35:52.000
The other thing is that dude looks straight at the date on the baby food as if to say,

35:52.000 --> 35:55.000
I'm not going down this road again.

35:55.000 --> 35:59.000
I know what we sell here is expired baby food.

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
And then we had to make a second stop.

36:01.000 --> 36:02.000
So bad name for your store.

36:02.000 --> 36:05.000
One stop super market.

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
I want to get another person up here.

36:07.000 --> 36:08.000
Okay.

36:08.000 --> 36:09.000
Yeah.

36:09.000 --> 36:17.000
Yes.

36:17.000 --> 36:20.000
Awesome haircuts.

36:20.000 --> 36:21.000
Solid haircuts.

36:21.000 --> 36:22.000
Hi.

36:22.000 --> 36:23.000
Hi.

36:23.000 --> 36:24.000
What's your name?

36:24.000 --> 36:25.000
My name is Amy.

36:25.000 --> 36:26.000
Amy.

36:26.000 --> 36:27.000
Amy.

36:27.000 --> 36:28.000
Do you understand the rules?

36:28.000 --> 36:29.000
No bummers.

36:29.000 --> 36:30.000
Right.

36:30.000 --> 36:31.000
Right.

36:31.000 --> 36:32.000
No.

36:32.000 --> 36:33.000
Here's my question.

36:33.000 --> 36:39.000
I was at grandma's funeral and...

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
Sorry, what was the question?

36:41.000 --> 36:42.000
Okay.

36:42.000 --> 36:47.000
So I volunteer with a quilt and textiles museum.

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
A lot of quiltsies in the house.

36:49.000 --> 36:50.000
Yeah.

36:50.000 --> 37:00.000
And I've been tasked with trying to figure out how to make quilts more hip.

37:00.000 --> 37:03.000
We got to sex up these quilts.

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
I'm on a youth council.

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
If that tells you anything about the usual.

37:07.000 --> 37:08.000
Okay.

37:08.000 --> 37:09.000
Let's give me an age demo.

37:09.000 --> 37:14.000
Cause I like stitch the cast of girls into the pictures of them.

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
Not their flesh.

37:16.000 --> 37:17.000
Do not.

37:17.000 --> 37:18.000
Oh, this is important.

37:18.000 --> 37:19.000
Oh my gosh.

37:19.000 --> 37:20.000
This is important.

37:20.000 --> 37:25.000
Do not render the flesh of the cast of girls into quilts and textiles.

37:25.000 --> 37:29.000
They will hate that.

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
And it is a crime.

37:31.000 --> 37:32.000
What's the age?

37:32.000 --> 37:33.000
What are we shooting for?

37:33.000 --> 37:36.000
We're going from 20 to 59.

37:36.000 --> 37:37.000
20 to 59.

37:37.000 --> 37:38.000
Okay.

37:38.000 --> 37:41.000
So the current demographic of the museum.

37:41.000 --> 37:42.000
60ish?

37:42.000 --> 37:43.000
Yeah.

37:43.000 --> 37:44.000
Plus.

37:44.000 --> 37:45.000
That seems intentional.

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
Like, okay, here's your age range.

37:47.000 --> 37:50.000
Anybody but 60 years.

37:50.000 --> 37:55.000
They are fully engrossed in the quilting lifestyle.

37:55.000 --> 37:58.000
Maybe some quotes from Fault in Our Stars.

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
You sew right in there.

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
Oh, I thought you said quilts from Fault in Our Stars.

38:02.000 --> 38:03.000
I haven't seen it.

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
I assumed it was very cool.

38:05.000 --> 38:10.000
We're going down a line of thinking right now, which is that if you craft this one perfect quilt,

38:10.000 --> 38:13.000
it will set the world free.

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
You guys got to think bigger.

38:15.000 --> 38:19.000
You got to think like.

38:19.000 --> 38:20.000
Maybe you get a celebrity.

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
Dwayne The Rock Johnson loves his sister.

38:22.000 --> 38:23.000
Dwayne The Rock Johnson loves to quilt.

38:23.000 --> 38:24.000
He loves to quilt.

38:24.000 --> 38:28.000
Well, you get a picture of him on Quilt Magazine.

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
Yeah, that's what it's called.

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
Quilt Magazine.

38:32.000 --> 38:35.000
You should see if you can get a picture of Dwayne The Rock Johnson.

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
He's got a quilt around his shoulders.

38:37.000 --> 38:47.000
And on the front of the magazine, it says, too fast, too meticulous.

38:47.000 --> 38:53.000
He didn't come into the series until Fast Five.

38:53.000 --> 38:56.000
How about just Quilt Five?

38:56.000 --> 39:02.000
Could we get picnics popping off?

39:02.000 --> 39:06.000
Are you saying that if we get picnics coming back in a big, big way,

39:06.000 --> 39:09.000
then Quilt Fever will fall right behind?

39:09.000 --> 39:10.000
Yeah.

39:10.000 --> 39:15.000
And then your night job at the basket factory is going to also explode.

39:15.000 --> 39:18.000
It's an investment in every facet of your career.

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
That would be a great app.

39:20.000 --> 39:25.000
It lists all the picnics in your area you should go join.

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
And now we're putting people together.

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
You get to cover picnics monthly.

39:29.000 --> 39:32.000
Dwayne The Rock Johnson says, too fast, too luxurious.

39:32.000 --> 39:35.000
And you're having him eat a picnic basket.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
Are picnics known for their luxuries?

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
Too fast, too fast, too sumptuous.

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
Picnics are the worst, and everybody hates them,

39:41.000 --> 39:44.000
but we can still keep doing them.

39:44.000 --> 39:48.000
What about, sorry, this is a rich vein.

39:48.000 --> 39:51.000
Can we get a tagline going that's like,

39:51.000 --> 39:56.000
Quilts is like a hundred little blankets in one,

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
all sewed up together.

39:58.000 --> 39:59.000
I like that.

39:59.000 --> 40:00.000
Okay, I did it.

40:00.000 --> 40:01.000
I did it, guys.

40:01.000 --> 40:02.000
It was me.

40:02.000 --> 40:05.000
Yay.

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
Let's say, should we show the room?

40:07.000 --> 40:08.000
Yeah.

40:08.000 --> 40:09.000
Oh, that museum.

40:09.000 --> 40:10.000
Yes.

40:10.000 --> 40:11.000
All right.

40:11.000 --> 40:12.000
Quilts.

40:12.000 --> 40:13.000
San Jose Museum of Quilts and Textiles.

40:13.000 --> 40:16.000
Does anybody see all there?

40:16.000 --> 40:20.000
This is the after party of the Quilt Museum.

40:20.000 --> 40:21.000
What do you got?

40:21.000 --> 40:28.000
What do you got, Show Saver?

40:28.000 --> 40:29.000
Show Saver 3.

40:29.000 --> 40:32.000
See if Baby is doing any cute baby tricks or stunts.

40:32.000 --> 40:33.000
Baby is not in the room.

40:33.000 --> 40:34.000
Nope.

40:34.000 --> 40:35.000
Baby by the door.

40:35.000 --> 40:36.000
Everyone look at the baby.

40:36.000 --> 40:37.000
Look at the baby.

40:37.000 --> 40:40.000
Oh my God, she waved.

40:40.000 --> 40:41.000
Yay.

40:41.000 --> 40:42.000
Hi, Charlie.

40:42.000 --> 40:43.000
Hi.

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
Everybody remember the feeling you feel right now.

40:45.000 --> 40:48.000
The feeling you associate with our show.

40:48.000 --> 40:49.000
Remember this.

40:49.000 --> 40:50.000
Remember this moment.

40:50.000 --> 40:51.000
Remember this one.

40:51.000 --> 40:52.000
Not the other one.

40:52.000 --> 40:53.000
Not where Travis said Boogler.

40:53.000 --> 40:54.000
Remember this.

40:54.000 --> 40:55.000
Remember this feeling.

40:55.000 --> 40:56.000
Thanks, Chuck.

40:56.000 --> 40:57.000
Thanks, Charlie.

40:57.000 --> 40:58.000
Thanks, Baby.

40:58.000 --> 40:59.000
You got anything else in the tank?

40:59.000 --> 41:00.000
Nope.

41:00.000 --> 41:01.000
Just putting your hand in your mouth.

41:01.000 --> 41:02.000
Oh, yes.

41:02.000 --> 41:03.000
That's good.

41:03.000 --> 41:04.000
Remember this.

41:04.000 --> 41:05.000
Sorry, I have my email open.

41:05.000 --> 41:06.000
Rachel, are you sending in questions during the show?

41:06.000 --> 41:19.000
While we're waiting for the doors to open.

41:19.000 --> 41:24.000
Okay.

41:24.000 --> 41:28.000
I'm both hurt and honored.

41:28.000 --> 41:32.000
I'm flipping through them right now because I want to drop a Sperling joint on the crowd.

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
What's the best one you sent in?

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
Oh, no.

41:36.000 --> 41:39.000
There's somebody who wants a book blurb.

41:39.000 --> 41:40.000
Oh, for sure.

41:40.000 --> 41:41.000
Okay.

41:41.000 --> 41:42.000
This one was sent in by Rachel Sperling.

41:42.000 --> 41:43.000
Game.

41:43.000 --> 41:44.000
Recognize game.

41:44.000 --> 41:45.000
Game.

41:45.000 --> 41:46.000
Recognize that game real quick.

41:46.000 --> 41:47.000
Oh.

41:47.000 --> 41:48.000
Oh, I see.

41:48.000 --> 41:49.000
Buckle up.

41:49.000 --> 41:50.000
Holy shit.

41:50.000 --> 42:05.000
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Jasmine, who has negative four points this week on the Yahoo

42:05.000 --> 42:07.240
Answers service.

42:07.240 --> 42:09.760
Anyone write a book blurb for me?

42:09.760 --> 42:14.640
Ashley Everett is a valiant.

42:14.640 --> 42:19.280
A valiant is a creature, much like a ghoul, who feeds on human flesh and is physically

42:19.280 --> 42:21.520
superior to the average human.

42:21.520 --> 42:23.880
Since some of the valiant feast is on animal flesh.

42:23.880 --> 42:28.720
If you feast on human flesh, you would better be physically superior to the average human.

42:28.720 --> 42:31.720
That is going to be a hard road to home.

42:31.720 --> 42:32.720
Hey, what the fuck?

42:32.720 --> 42:33.720
Oh, sorry.

42:33.720 --> 42:34.720
Sorry.

42:34.720 --> 42:35.720
Sorry.

42:35.720 --> 42:36.720
Sorry.

42:36.720 --> 42:37.720
I thought you were a ham.

42:37.720 --> 42:42.200
Since some of the valiant feast on animal flesh, also pure blood, is a valiant who has only

42:42.200 --> 42:47.720
ever feasted the highest quality of human flesh, ash, which I'm assuming is short for

42:47.720 --> 42:50.640
Ashley Everett, is the descendant of the pure-blood Anthea.

42:50.640 --> 42:51.640
Oh my God.

42:51.640 --> 42:57.360
So the plot of the story is, Ash was abducted from her home at the age of seven and although

42:57.360 --> 43:01.100
she was stronger than any human or valiant, being pure blood, they injected some serum

43:01.100 --> 43:03.260
into her neck and blah, blah.

43:03.260 --> 43:06.720
She was tortured and only escaped about 10 or so years later.

43:06.720 --> 43:10.980
So basically this organization is trying to get her back and stuff and they decide to

43:10.980 --> 43:13.160
announce war on the valiant and stuff.

43:13.160 --> 43:16.760
I know it sounds terrible and I haven't described it very well, but I was wondering if someone

43:16.760 --> 43:20.200
could write me a description slash blurb, 10 points to the best one.

43:20.200 --> 43:22.480
Hey, you ain't got 10 points to give out.

43:22.480 --> 43:27.200
You have negative four points.

43:27.200 --> 43:29.960
So let's write this blurb.

43:29.960 --> 43:30.960
Let's write this book.

43:30.960 --> 43:33.680
Let's write this plot.

43:33.680 --> 43:37.200
I'd rather write the screenplay adaptation because this is going to be huge.

43:37.200 --> 43:43.240
Would this be the first ever screenplay based on a Yahoo answer?

43:43.240 --> 43:47.560
Other than 40 days or 49 days.

43:47.560 --> 43:50.000
Oh, I'll write a sad lip for it real quick.

43:50.000 --> 43:51.000
Oh boy.

43:51.000 --> 43:52.000
No, no, no.

43:52.000 --> 43:58.720
You don't need to because this was just a big pile of garbage words.

43:58.720 --> 44:03.640
I think that my favorite part of the email is that this person who created this world

44:03.640 --> 44:07.600
then went on to say, I haven't described it very well.

44:07.600 --> 44:10.360
You all do a better job.

44:10.360 --> 44:14.800
I'm so glad the reins are in your hands for your fiction property.

44:14.800 --> 44:16.800
I'm glad somebody else is describing the world.

44:16.800 --> 44:17.800
No, it's just you.

44:17.800 --> 44:18.800
Okay.

44:18.800 --> 44:22.400
You know what really helps me garner information to write a blurb for somebody?

44:22.400 --> 44:23.400
Blah blah.

44:23.400 --> 44:29.440
She's a ghoul who's tortured, you know.

44:29.440 --> 44:31.760
What was the blah blah covering?

44:31.760 --> 44:34.600
I can't write a blurb, but I can literally agent this shit.

44:34.600 --> 44:40.280
Can we change it from valiance to sex zombies?

44:40.280 --> 44:41.840
Or perhaps sex mummies.

44:41.840 --> 44:42.840
And now it's about mummies.

44:42.840 --> 44:44.760
I'm taking it in a bit of a different direction.

44:44.760 --> 44:48.320
A few notes for you, Jasmine.

44:48.320 --> 44:49.320
Mummies are in right now.

44:49.320 --> 44:50.320
Mummies are the next thing.

44:50.320 --> 44:53.880
Can you write a book about, nope, I didn't have it.

44:53.880 --> 44:56.640
Should we get somebody else up here?

44:56.640 --> 44:57.640
You right there.

44:57.640 --> 44:58.640
Come on up.

44:58.640 --> 44:59.640
Yes.

44:59.640 --> 45:00.640
Round of applause.

45:00.640 --> 45:01.640
Hey.

45:01.640 --> 45:02.640
What's up?

45:02.640 --> 45:10.640
Hey, not much.

45:10.640 --> 45:11.640
Cool.

45:11.640 --> 45:12.640
Cool, cool, cool.

45:12.640 --> 45:13.640
What have you been up to?

45:13.640 --> 45:14.640
What have you been doing for the past 45 minutes?

45:14.640 --> 45:15.640
What have I been doing for the past 45 minutes?

45:15.640 --> 45:16.640
Yeah.

45:16.640 --> 45:17.640
I've just been chilling.

45:17.640 --> 45:18.640
Nice, nice, nice.

45:18.640 --> 45:19.640
What's your question?

45:19.640 --> 45:20.640
What is your name?

45:20.640 --> 45:21.640
What is your name?

45:21.640 --> 45:22.640
My name is Matt.

45:22.640 --> 45:23.640
Matt, do you understand the rules?

45:23.640 --> 45:24.640
No, bummers.

45:24.640 --> 45:25.640
Okay, got it.

45:25.640 --> 45:26.640
All right.

45:26.640 --> 45:33.640
So, my question, so, my roommate got a dog a couple years back.

45:33.640 --> 45:40.640
The statute of limitations on this question is already far, far past the point where you

45:40.640 --> 45:41.640
can think about it.

45:41.640 --> 45:42.640
Okay.

45:42.640 --> 45:49.640
So, the problem is, normally, when you get a dog, after the first year, you normally

45:49.640 --> 45:51.640
get them fixed, especially if they're girl dogs.

45:51.640 --> 45:52.640
Yeah.

45:52.640 --> 45:53.640
He hasn't done that.

45:53.640 --> 45:58.640
And it's been, probably, she's going on four years old at this point.

45:58.640 --> 46:03.640
I've told her that we should get her fixed because she comes in, because she has her,

46:03.640 --> 46:05.640
like, lady periods every time.

46:05.640 --> 46:07.640
You can just say periods.

46:07.640 --> 46:08.640
Yeah, yeah.

46:08.640 --> 46:14.640
She gets, yeah, she has her periods and there's all the nastiness associated with that.

46:14.640 --> 46:17.640
Am I right, ladies?

46:17.640 --> 46:22.640
And so, I keep telling him to do this and he doesn't want to because it costs money.

46:22.640 --> 46:25.640
If you're asking if you should do it yourself, the answer is no.

46:25.640 --> 46:28.640
No, I'm not going to take his dog to the vet and get it fixed.

46:28.640 --> 46:33.640
That is not what Justin meant.

46:33.640 --> 46:37.640
Justin was suggesting a budget approach.

46:37.640 --> 46:39.640
Bottle of red.

46:39.640 --> 46:40.640
Bottle of white.

46:40.640 --> 46:43.640
Get a scalpel and do it tonight.

46:43.640 --> 46:44.640
What are you saying?

46:44.640 --> 46:45.640
What the fuck?

46:45.640 --> 46:47.640
You know what he's talking about?

46:47.640 --> 46:48.640
No, no, no, listen.

46:48.640 --> 46:49.640
This is my new parody.

46:49.640 --> 46:51.640
I've seen it from a retired restaurant.

46:51.640 --> 46:56.640
It's all about fixing a dog at home.

46:56.640 --> 46:58.640
Hi, I'm Weird Al Yankovic too.

46:58.640 --> 46:59.640
Thank you for having me.

46:59.640 --> 47:00.640
Creepy owl.

47:00.640 --> 47:01.640
Wait, Yankovic.

47:01.640 --> 47:02.640
Weirder Al Yankovic.

47:02.640 --> 47:03.640
Struggle with it.

47:03.640 --> 47:07.640
There are clinics that you can take dogs to.

47:07.640 --> 47:09.640
I'm pretty sure they do this for free.

47:09.640 --> 47:10.640
That's a huge overstep.

47:10.640 --> 47:12.640
You can't just do that to somebody's dog.

47:12.640 --> 47:14.640
You can.

47:14.640 --> 47:16.640
Trust me.

47:16.640 --> 47:20.640
I make a habit of picking up people's dogs and taking them to clinics and saying,

47:20.640 --> 47:21.640
fix this dog.

47:21.640 --> 47:22.640
This dog is broken.

47:22.640 --> 47:25.640
They may be at a point right now where they're like, dog, I may want another one of you.

47:25.640 --> 47:27.640
You're a pretty good dog.

47:27.640 --> 47:30.640
I'm going to leave that door open.

47:30.640 --> 47:32.640
Is it a dog or a cat?

47:32.640 --> 47:33.640
It's a dog.

47:33.640 --> 47:36.640
Still a dog from the beginning of the question.

47:36.640 --> 47:38.640
Same dog.

47:38.640 --> 47:39.640
Hold on.

47:39.640 --> 47:43.640
We get updates every five minutes to whether this dog has been transmogrified.

47:43.640 --> 47:45.640
Is it a peacock or still a dog?

47:45.640 --> 47:46.640
Cool.

47:46.640 --> 47:51.640
As an addendum, he wasn't getting her fixed at first because he wanted her to have puppies.

47:51.640 --> 47:54.640
But we live in an apartment, so he backed out on that.

47:54.640 --> 47:57.640
So now it's just specifically budget.

47:57.640 --> 47:59.640
Terrific.

47:59.640 --> 48:02.640
Maybe a Kickstarter?

48:02.640 --> 48:05.640
What would the rewards be, Justin?

48:05.640 --> 48:07.640
Just one more off the streets.

48:07.640 --> 48:11.640
For $200, you can keep the leftovers.

48:11.640 --> 48:13.640
Can you stop it?

48:13.640 --> 48:14.640
Travis, can you?

48:14.640 --> 48:16.640
One, them's good eaten.

48:16.640 --> 48:18.640
Two, gross.

48:18.640 --> 48:20.640
I can't believe you said that.

48:20.640 --> 48:24.640
Can the Kickstarter be for your new invention?

48:24.640 --> 48:26.640
This might not go good.

48:26.640 --> 48:28.640
Dog tampons.

48:28.640 --> 48:31.640
Dog tampons?

48:31.640 --> 48:32.640
I don't know.

48:32.640 --> 48:33.640
We could try it.

48:33.640 --> 48:34.640
Right now we just go with...

48:34.640 --> 48:36.640
We need to try it.

48:36.640 --> 48:37.640
We have to try it.

48:37.640 --> 48:43.640
Right now we're going with MacGyver dog pads, which are made from old underwears.

48:43.640 --> 48:46.640
That's not my idea.

48:46.640 --> 48:48.640
Hold on, hold on.

48:48.640 --> 48:51.640
How does the dog feel about this?

48:51.640 --> 48:53.640
Have you asked her?

48:53.640 --> 48:55.640
Look, it's not me doing this.

48:55.640 --> 48:56.640
I should hope not.

48:56.640 --> 48:58.640
No one should be doing this.

48:58.640 --> 49:02.640
If it's any indication, they tend to come off quite often.

49:02.640 --> 49:08.640
Yeah, dog, because that's not where that's supposed to go.

49:08.640 --> 49:09.640
This is fun.

49:09.640 --> 49:10.640
Is it?

49:10.640 --> 49:15.640
No, the reason this is fun, this is a commentary on the human condition, the idea of momentum

49:15.640 --> 49:16.640
making you just...

49:16.640 --> 49:20.640
This sounds like it's way more trouble to deal with than just spending the money to

49:20.640 --> 49:21.640
get the fig.

49:21.640 --> 49:23.640
But at this point, he's already waited four years.

49:23.640 --> 49:25.640
And if he does it now, he's just caving.

49:25.640 --> 49:27.640
He's got to go the whole way now.

49:27.640 --> 49:29.640
Now he's four years in.

49:29.640 --> 49:34.640
When that dog dies, he will sigh and say, I did it.

49:34.640 --> 49:35.640
I did it.

49:35.640 --> 49:36.640
I did it.

49:36.640 --> 49:37.640
I kept...

49:37.640 --> 49:38.640
She kept...

49:38.640 --> 49:40.640
It's not a boy dog.

49:40.640 --> 49:43.640
No, I'm talking about the roommate, not the dog.

49:43.640 --> 49:44.640
Well, hold on.

49:44.640 --> 49:45.640
Is it a boy dog?

49:45.640 --> 49:46.640
Just to check.

49:46.640 --> 49:47.640
Still a girl, right?

49:47.640 --> 49:48.640
Still a dog, too, right?

49:48.640 --> 49:49.640
It is still a dog.

49:49.640 --> 49:50.640
It is still a girl.

49:50.640 --> 49:52.640
So glad we could help.

49:52.640 --> 49:54.640
Did we...

49:54.640 --> 49:57.640
Also, since everybody else has been plugging shit, can I throw something out before I walk

49:57.640 --> 49:58.640
away?

49:58.640 --> 50:00.640
Did you say dog tampons?

50:00.640 --> 50:01.640
You know what?

50:01.640 --> 50:02.640
Shit, why not?

50:02.640 --> 50:04.640
We'll throw dog tampons in for free.

50:04.640 --> 50:06.640
That's in next year's goodie bag.

50:06.640 --> 50:08.640
You can check it in the next fun con.

50:08.640 --> 50:12.640
A condom and a dog tampon.

50:12.640 --> 50:13.640
Thank you, Matthew.

50:13.640 --> 50:14.640
Round of applause.

50:14.640 --> 50:17.640
Thank you.

50:17.640 --> 50:18.640
Do we need to do...

50:18.640 --> 50:20.640
We have just a few minutes left.

50:20.640 --> 50:22.640
Do you want to do the last show saver?

50:22.640 --> 50:23.640
I don't have any more.

50:23.640 --> 50:24.640
I only did three.

50:24.640 --> 50:25.640
Oh.

50:25.640 --> 50:26.640
Okay.

50:26.640 --> 50:27.640
I thought you...

50:27.640 --> 50:28.640
I don't think that's true, Justin.

50:28.640 --> 50:29.640
I think you definitely have one more on there.

50:29.640 --> 50:30.640
I don't have any more.

50:30.640 --> 50:31.640
Stop.

50:31.640 --> 50:32.640
Travis, stop.

50:32.640 --> 50:33.640
Travis, stop.

50:33.640 --> 50:46.980
I'm going to carry it around like a boxing ring, like round announcer person.

50:46.980 --> 50:57.120
So if you listen to the Chicago show, you'll know prior to the Chicago live show, Justin

50:57.120 --> 50:59.800
shit his pants.

50:59.800 --> 51:01.640
And then the show went so well.

51:01.640 --> 51:05.120
And he was like, let's keep it going.

51:05.120 --> 51:10.320
And Justin, the sign says, if I can read it here to the people at home, Justin pooped

51:10.320 --> 51:11.320
his pants.

51:11.320 --> 51:12.320
On the way here.

51:12.320 --> 51:17.080
It's like his new, like separating the yellow Skittles from the rest of them so he can rock.

51:17.080 --> 51:18.080
Oh, gross.

51:18.080 --> 51:20.880
So I'm driving to Columbus to catch our flight.

51:20.880 --> 51:21.880
We got a baby in the car.

51:21.880 --> 51:25.840
And when you have a baby in the car, maybe with our baby and probably with a lot of babies,

51:25.840 --> 51:29.600
once they fall asleep, you just keep going because man, the baby's asleep.

51:29.600 --> 51:30.720
So you're driving.

51:30.720 --> 51:31.720
It's like speed.

51:31.720 --> 51:32.720
You can't stop.

51:32.720 --> 51:33.720
The baby's asleep.

51:33.720 --> 51:34.720
You can't stop the car.

51:34.720 --> 51:38.400
And as soon as the baby fell asleep, I had to use the bathroom.

51:38.400 --> 51:42.080
I knew, I knew I needed to use the bathroom, but I couldn't stop.

51:42.080 --> 51:46.440
This lasted for about an hour and we drove past the McDonald's and I looked at McDonald's

51:46.440 --> 51:55.400
and I remember having the state thought, I'd love to poop at that McDonald's.

51:55.400 --> 51:58.600
I would love to poop at that McDonald's.

51:58.600 --> 52:03.640
And I drive past that McDonald's and the instant, the instant I am past that McDonald's, Charlie

52:03.640 --> 52:04.760
wakes up.

52:04.760 --> 52:06.240
So now there's a screaming baby.

52:06.240 --> 52:07.560
I think I can finally do it.

52:07.560 --> 52:10.220
And I just kept driving and eventually I was going to die.

52:10.220 --> 52:15.240
So I pulled off onto a dirt road where I thought that I could do this in peace.

52:15.240 --> 52:19.360
I said, honey, I need baby wipes because I'm going to use the bathroom.

52:19.360 --> 52:26.960
And then I pull off the side of the road and I shit you not.

52:26.960 --> 52:28.260
I kid you not.

52:28.260 --> 52:34.200
There was a van sitting there exactly where I was going to go use the bathroom, just sitting

52:34.200 --> 52:40.160
there smoking like they were waiting for people to come try to use the bathroom in this exact

52:40.160 --> 52:41.160
spot.

52:41.160 --> 52:47.160
So I drove on down the road and there was a Wendy's eventually, or I saw a Speedway

52:47.160 --> 52:53.400
rather and I almost stopped there, but then, oh hubris friends, because I also needed,

52:53.400 --> 52:59.480
I was hungry too, so I saw a Wendy's up the road a little bit and then I hit a stoplight.

52:59.480 --> 53:00.480
Oh, classic.

53:00.480 --> 53:07.240
And then I got to the door of the Wendy's and as I was going in the Wendy's thing, it

53:07.240 --> 53:08.240
all fell apart.

53:08.240 --> 53:11.400
And this is where it gets like Werner Herzog levels of tragedy.

53:11.400 --> 53:16.440
I didn't, they didn't have a trash can for anything.

53:16.440 --> 53:22.440
So I left, not that he was going to shit in the trash can, I left him in the corner and

53:22.440 --> 53:23.440
I left.

53:23.440 --> 53:28.240
Because, okay, my two options were that or have Dave Thomas's fucking ghost watching

53:28.240 --> 53:30.280
me carry dirty underwear through the restaurant.

53:30.280 --> 53:31.280
I'm not going to do that.

53:31.280 --> 53:34.760
And then just walk out to the counter and go, oh, where would you like me to put this?

53:34.760 --> 53:38.320
Do you have a special receptacle for dirty laundry?

53:38.320 --> 53:43.120
30 minutes later, Charlie used to eat, oh, by the way, I did order food at the drive

53:43.120 --> 53:50.120
through and I got a fucking jalapeno chicken sandwich with ghost pepper sauce on it.

53:50.120 --> 53:53.240
I wasn't even thinking.

53:53.240 --> 53:58.080
And then a half hour later, Charlie had to, uh, had to eat and said he wanted to stop

53:58.080 --> 53:59.080
and we passed the Wendy's.

53:59.080 --> 54:00.080
He said stop there.

54:00.080 --> 54:01.080
I said, I can't do that.

54:01.080 --> 54:04.080
What if they put out an all Wendy's bullets in a little bit?

54:04.080 --> 54:07.120
I can't go in Wendy's ever again.

54:07.120 --> 54:09.360
I forgot how long that story was.

54:09.360 --> 54:10.360
I goaded you into telling it.

54:10.360 --> 54:11.360
Well, that's going to do it for us.

54:11.360 --> 54:12.360
Let me give you one more question.

54:12.360 --> 54:13.360
You got another question?

54:13.360 --> 54:14.360
Uh, how about this one?

54:14.360 --> 54:15.360
It was sent in by Jadon.

54:15.360 --> 54:16.360
Yes.

54:16.360 --> 54:17.360
Jadon is not here.

54:17.360 --> 54:18.360
Wait, is he?

54:18.360 --> 54:19.360
Jadon.

54:19.360 --> 54:20.360
Jadon.

54:20.360 --> 54:21.360
Okay.

54:21.360 --> 54:25.640
I thought Drew knew whether Jadon was here or not.

54:25.640 --> 54:26.640
No, no.

54:26.640 --> 54:27.640
He's back of the office.

54:27.640 --> 54:33.840
It's by Yahoo answers user Liz who asks, I need to learn how to work at Subway.

54:33.840 --> 54:36.720
I just got a summer job at Subway and I start my training in three days.

54:36.720 --> 54:41.360
I really want to know something before I get there so I can pick up everything fast and

54:41.360 --> 54:43.080
get to work quicker.

54:43.080 --> 54:46.760
Stuff like how to work the register, how to bake bread, et cetera would be helpful.

54:46.760 --> 54:47.760
Thanks.

54:47.760 --> 54:52.320
Is this the first person ever who doesn't want to waste time working at Subway?

54:52.320 --> 54:54.760
Like I want to get straight to work.

54:54.760 --> 54:59.700
I think they want to roll up and then be like, all right, here's your, here's your mess smock

54:59.700 --> 55:04.000
and here's your name tag and I'm going to show you how to use a provolone slicer and

55:04.000 --> 55:05.000
they're like, don't even bother.

55:05.000 --> 55:06.000
Oh my God.

55:06.000 --> 55:07.000
You did it perfect your first time.

55:07.000 --> 55:08.000
You are the chosen one.

55:08.000 --> 55:15.080
You are the chosen, you are, you are the, the focal ascendant.

55:15.080 --> 55:18.040
That's the bad part about that if you go in there and too good, they're going to think

55:18.040 --> 55:21.760
you're the one for prophecy and then you got to fight a dragon or something.

55:21.760 --> 55:23.400
You got to fight the salami dragon.

55:23.400 --> 55:33.520
That's the name of my favorite Def Leppard album, fight the salami dragon.

55:33.520 --> 55:40.720
Is there an underground, fuck, is there an underground black market Subway school that

55:40.720 --> 55:43.960
we can run to get people better at their craft?

55:43.960 --> 55:48.960
I was, I worked next to a subway at the country's best yogurt once and I would go in there basically

55:48.960 --> 55:53.320
every day and I would get that smell on me and it's still on me to this day and one time

55:53.320 --> 55:56.920
somebody was making my sandwich and then they cut their finger and then they, but they're

55:56.920 --> 55:58.640
wearing a plastic thing on their hands.

55:58.640 --> 56:03.600
So that was aesthetically just, but the worst, there's a very challenging ending to this

56:03.600 --> 56:09.640
episode of my brother, my brother and me, but then they tried to fucking one hand it

56:09.640 --> 56:15.840
like, they tried to like do it with their good clean hand and then the manager came

56:15.840 --> 56:18.280
out and was like, don't just go in the back room.

56:18.280 --> 56:21.560
I was so angry at you at this moment.

56:21.560 --> 56:24.360
I worked at Jimmy John's for a while.

56:24.360 --> 56:25.360
Not Jermaine.

56:25.360 --> 56:30.680
No, it is because I never learned to make any sandwiches the whole time I was there

56:30.680 --> 56:33.920
because this is not a joke.

56:33.920 --> 56:38.440
They're so obsessed with being fast that they would every time be like, Travis hop on the

56:38.440 --> 56:42.400
line and make like a number 1400 sandwich or whatever and I would say, okay, no one's

56:42.400 --> 56:43.400
trained me to do that yet.

56:43.400 --> 56:44.400
And they're like, oh, there's no time for that.

56:44.400 --> 56:49.960
Just get on the register every time for six months and I'm like, okay.

56:49.960 --> 56:54.280
And then when I went to quit, the dude was like, how about instead we make you assistant

56:54.280 --> 57:02.000
manager and I was like, Austin, I still don't know how to make sandwiches.

57:02.000 --> 57:07.000
Yeah, no, you're, you, you would be more big picture.

57:07.000 --> 57:11.560
I was just there to develop him in the taste and development department.

57:11.560 --> 57:13.280
What if we take the bread away?

57:13.280 --> 57:16.640
What are we left with then?

57:16.640 --> 57:17.640
It's a disaster ball.

57:17.640 --> 57:18.640
It's an oops, no bread.

57:18.640 --> 57:24.520
The salami is on the outside, the bread's in the middle.

57:24.520 --> 57:29.040
How about, no, none of it has been a thing yet.

57:29.040 --> 57:30.040
Let's stop the show.

57:30.040 --> 57:31.040
We've done, we've, we're exhausted.

57:31.040 --> 57:32.040
Okay.

57:32.040 --> 57:35.040
And we don't have any more, we got to walk down the mountain.

57:35.040 --> 57:36.040
Yeah.

57:36.040 --> 57:41.560
Thank you so much for having us here at a maximum fun convention.

57:41.560 --> 57:45.960
We've had a lot of fun eating a lot of good food.

57:45.960 --> 57:48.160
Thanks to everybody that Jesse mentioned earlier.

57:48.160 --> 57:49.160
Yeah.

57:49.160 --> 57:52.400
Like I know, I feel like I know most of the names, but then I'll forget one and that person

57:52.400 --> 57:53.400
will feel so shitty.

57:53.400 --> 57:56.360
I don't want to do that to them.

57:56.360 --> 58:03.800
I will say Jesse didn't thank our wives and I want to thank you to our wives and our baby.

58:03.800 --> 58:06.360
Well, it's not our baby.

58:06.360 --> 58:07.360
Careful.

58:07.360 --> 58:10.720
Takes a village Griffin, takes a village.

58:10.720 --> 58:14.360
Real quick before we end, we just want to jump back in to say thank you once more to

58:14.360 --> 58:15.360

Let go of my shoe.

58:34.760 --> 58:37.320
I was thinking like, you know how TV shows have those things at the end.

58:37.320 --> 58:42.440
It's like a fun little cartoon and it's like, what if we had one of those for the end of

58:42.440 --> 58:43.440
our show?

58:43.440 --> 58:44.440
What would that look like?

58:44.440 --> 58:45.440
Justin?

58:45.440 --> 58:46.440
What did you think about it?

58:46.440 --> 58:47.440
Let me have this guy.

58:47.440 --> 58:48.440
Sit boo boo.

58:48.440 --> 58:49.440
Sit good dog.

58:49.440 --> 58:50.440
Nailed it.

58:50.440 --> 58:51.440
Back to the show.

58:51.440 --> 58:52.440
Hold on.

58:52.440 --> 58:53.440
Hold on.

58:53.440 --> 58:54.440
Hold on.

58:54.440 --> 58:55.440
Hold on.

58:55.440 --> 58:56.440
Can we get Chuck Lorre to write one of his really funny disclaimers?

58:56.440 --> 59:02.920
That was a Chuck Lorre release from River to you.

59:02.920 --> 59:03.920
The listening audience.

59:03.920 --> 59:04.920
