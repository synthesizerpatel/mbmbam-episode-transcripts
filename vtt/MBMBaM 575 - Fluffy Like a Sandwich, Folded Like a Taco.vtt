WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

00:05.760 --> 00:10.580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

00:11.480 --> 00:17.660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

00:17.660 --> 00:30.660
What's up, you cool, baby?

00:47.940 --> 00:50.020
It's better it's better with you

00:53.940 --> 00:56.020
It's better it's better with you

01:00.260 --> 01:02.260
Better it's better with you

01:10.420 --> 01:15.900
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother my brother and me an advice show for the modern era

01:15.900 --> 01:23.200
I'm your boldest brother Justin McElroy. I'm your midwest brother Travis big dog whoo whoo whoo for McElroy

01:30.700 --> 01:35.020
This is the show this is my brother my brother meets an advice show

01:37.300 --> 01:41.140
Looking up I was I was logging into the app of just of note today

01:41.140 --> 01:46.460
Okay, talk about you were jacking in I was I was hacking in jacking in

01:47.660 --> 01:49.980
You jacking them in so

01:51.140 --> 01:53.860
I'm huge on tick-tock. Yeah, and yes

01:53.940 --> 02:00.000
I just want to talk about it because is it your character where you talk about cryptocurrency trends now?

02:00.000 --> 02:04.920
It's not crypto kid damn that hasn't found purchase in the soil crypto kid did not

02:04.920 --> 02:11.400
Catch catch on easy the one where you just kind of posted a video of some guys

02:11.600 --> 02:17.600
That vaguely look like a love child of our dad and Paul's the born singing a song together

02:18.040 --> 02:20.280
What no that was oh?

02:20.600 --> 02:23.120
No, you did it the music from

02:24.080 --> 02:29.240
That's music for the mercenaries. It would take far too long to yeah

02:29.240 --> 02:36.240
this is um, I will I will tell you I will play the art of the audio this becoming comes such a big hit and

02:37.800 --> 02:39.800
This is a touchstone of my childhood

02:40.880 --> 02:44.080
That I've been trying to get going again for years. Yeah

02:45.040 --> 02:48.400
So let me just play this and then we'll like move on from there. Give me one second

02:50.560 --> 02:55.040
When I was a little lad if I wanted berries and cream and mommy made me do the little lad dance

02:55.040 --> 03:00.280
Now mummy's gone, but I still like to do the little lad dance and you might too you just

03:01.600 --> 03:03.600
Run in place

03:04.080 --> 03:09.880
Nice form. So this is him like telling you how to do it. But here's the actual idea. It looks a little something like this

03:17.240 --> 03:22.000
You look wonderful now sing the berries and cream song

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
Sing the berries and cream song

03:24.560 --> 03:31.540
Berries and cream berries and cream. I'm a little lad who loves berries and cream up the octave. Go for it

03:37.480 --> 03:42.140
So I've been trying to get this guy to make a comeback for a very long time by the way

03:42.280 --> 03:46.400
He's now a dance teacher. Yeah, who does not like to talk about the little no

03:48.360 --> 03:50.120
Jack Ferver

03:50.120 --> 03:57.040
his genre defying performances which have been called so extreme that they sometimes look and feel like

03:57.600 --> 03:58.720
exorcisms

03:58.720 --> 04:04.680
Explore the tragic comedy of the human psyche, but also he was the berries and cream boy

04:04.680 --> 04:10.940
Also, he fucking loves berries and cream and please don't mention it cuz he don't like it. He don't like to talk

04:11.640 --> 04:13.640
Because I like it so much

04:13.960 --> 04:18.280
So here's the thing I put this sound up and I I wrote

04:18.280 --> 04:24.040
I just uploaded the sound as a as a public service right take time. Yeah. Yeah, and I just wrote on there

04:24.040 --> 04:29.000
Please make great art with this sound. It's what we all need and it's at dormant since

04:29.440 --> 04:35.360
January 5th and then at some point in August all of the teens. Yes

04:36.160 --> 04:41.000
All of the teens decided they could do something really special with this sound

04:41.480 --> 04:46.520
And so far it the the video itself, which is not even like a good predictor of

04:46.520 --> 04:50.160
of okay, the this the sound has been used in

04:51.160 --> 04:53.160
12600

04:53.160 --> 04:54.120
a

04:54.120 --> 04:57.360
Normal amount a lot. Oh, it's a lot a lot a lot

04:57.600 --> 05:01.400
That's a lot. That's a lot. I don't know

05:01.400 --> 05:05.800
It's so big and it went viral and here's the thing about it guys

05:06.640 --> 05:09.080
I'm a creative professional, right?

05:09.080 --> 05:16.560
If I may be so bold like I'm in an entertainer

05:16.560 --> 05:22.760
I'm a creative professional, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, definitely. Definitely. Definitely. It is almost now a

05:23.880 --> 05:25.880
hundred percent assured

05:26.840 --> 05:28.840
that the biggest

05:29.400 --> 05:32.040
cultural impact I will have

05:32.040 --> 05:40.560
Speaking in a global sense is the fact that I uploaded a clip of the Berries and Green Boy

05:41.160 --> 05:43.640
Nothing I do after or before

05:44.520 --> 05:46.520
in terms of scope

05:46.960 --> 05:53.880
Will reach as many people as the time I clicked upload on the Berries and Green Boy dance

05:53.880 --> 06:01.080
When when we get to the 2024 election cycle and MSNBC brings you on to get your thoughts because I believe by that point

06:01.080 --> 06:07.520
You will be I don't know maybe a lawyer or a political commentator your caption at the bottom will say Justin McElroy

06:07.680 --> 06:09.680
Berries and cream amplifier

06:10.400 --> 06:12.400
and flu you are

06:12.720 --> 06:14.720
You are living the first line of your obituary

06:15.520 --> 06:17.520
Right, right. I'm in it

06:18.760 --> 06:26.080
Justin McElroy primarily known for putting berries and cream sound on tik-tok died today when he was murdered by jack

06:26.080 --> 06:30.920
Fervor, whoa, Justin was the berries and cream guy. No, no

06:32.000 --> 06:36.960
He put the sound up on the tik-tok app and all and then he was the biggest thing he's ever

06:38.320 --> 06:40.320
Subsequently murdered by the berries

06:40.320 --> 06:47.840
The truth of this is just a career I thought it would be fun to talk about

06:48.520 --> 06:51.880
The truth of it is crushed. Yeah. No, it's

06:53.680 --> 06:55.680
Crushing me there's

06:56.480 --> 06:58.640
12,600 videos

06:58.640 --> 07:06.040
Millions upon millions of views of my greatest work, which is uploading the South for the Paris

07:06.040 --> 07:12.520
Great point. Yeah, it's like when Michelangelo unveiled the roof of the the Sistine Chapel

07:12.960 --> 07:18.960
But then while he was doing it he farted and then that's all people would talk about for the rest of his life

07:18.960 --> 07:24.120
Even that Travis, it's not even that trap. It's like it's like if Michelangelo

07:26.360 --> 07:32.080
Told everybody a dirty limerick that he heard when he was a kid and that was the thing

07:32.080 --> 07:38.560
Everybody was like, oh, yeah, Michelangelo. He's the one that always used to recite that dirty limerick for everybody

07:38.560 --> 07:42.180
I love that. Hey check out the ceiling of this beautiful building

07:42.180 --> 07:49.120
It was painted by that guy who retold that dirty limerick. Yeah, who recited a dirty limerick from memory

07:49.880 --> 07:54.440
Except it's like it's even worse than that because it's from a Starburst

07:54.680 --> 07:58.680
Yeah, it's not even like a funny clip from a movie or a song

07:58.680 --> 08:05.200
It would be like if Michelangelo's great claim to fame was he recited this McDonald's commercial from memory

08:05.200 --> 08:07.280
And we all loved it so much

08:07.280 --> 08:13.680
It was better than his paintings for sure. That actually would be pretty amazing if it was like Michelangelo saying ba-da-ba-ba-ba

08:13.680 --> 08:18.920
I'm loving it first. But because something had traveled back in time and

08:19.560 --> 08:21.400
Influenced him to do that

08:21.400 --> 08:24.800
Like we love like you guys know like

08:24.800 --> 08:28.600
Sure, we love the nerd shit, you know what I mean?

08:28.600 --> 08:35.320
Like Dungeons and Dragons and Munch Squad and all this garbage. But like our dream is always

08:36.160 --> 08:39.360
Like to be able to break free of it, you know what I mean?

08:39.360 --> 08:45.960
And to be our own like to not to just be a mainstream success. We're fake geek boys is what we are. Yeah, yeah, yeah

08:46.280 --> 08:49.560
I'm ready to shed that. Who's somebody who's like

08:49.560 --> 08:56.080
Oh, man, I was trying to think of somebody who has done this and has not come crashing back down to earth like fucking problematic

08:56.080 --> 08:58.340
Icarus hold on. Give me a second

08:59.440 --> 09:01.440
No, I don't have anybody but you

09:02.680 --> 09:06.600
Just sort of like conceptually it might be possible. Yeah

09:07.240 --> 09:14.800
It will definitely be us who will make this succeed. We'll be the first ones, but it's like I finally found mainstream success and

09:14.800 --> 09:19.580
The real double whammy is it's not even a way. I'll financially

09:21.920 --> 09:25.840
Stolen content that I don't have the right to reproduce now

09:25.840 --> 09:30.320
Yes, I would go so far as to say juice. Not only will you not financially benefit from it?

09:30.460 --> 09:34.000
You will not brand wise benefit from no

09:34.840 --> 09:40.320
There will be no increase in your SEO because of it you will find

09:40.320 --> 09:46.360
Literally, no benefit for your great work the actual the only actual repercussion

09:46.880 --> 09:50.760
Might be actually that I find myself at the center of a tawdry

09:51.320 --> 09:56.840
legal threat now, but from that verse incorporated that's something you could make into a

10:00.680 --> 10:03.320
You could make a movie out of that yeah

10:03.320 --> 10:09.120
The guy that the guy that got sued by starburst I love that guy what a hero to the people it wouldn't be that

10:09.240 --> 10:15.640
Please you have to you have to come testify. No, I don't like talking about the berries and cream thing anymore Jack

10:15.640 --> 10:18.760
Please please Jack you have to go testify

10:22.600 --> 10:27.080
Me and Jack Ferber have a thing in common now. Yeah, I don't want to talk about the birds

10:27.080 --> 10:30.240
It's a great thing anymore. Now you get other stuff, you know

10:30.240 --> 10:35.200
You understand why he is the way he is about the berries and cream ad because you also don't want to be just that

10:35.920 --> 10:39.640
There is also a possibility here and I don't want to get too meta here

10:39.680 --> 10:45.760
But this is such a specific reference and such a weird thing that was created back in like 2000 whatever

10:46.240 --> 10:53.960
that it's possible that this is something Justin puts out right and some youth sees it now who never saw the

10:53.960 --> 10:57.680
Commercial and then eventually time travel is created

10:57.680 --> 11:04.840
They go back in time tell someone about it before the commercial is made and inspires the commercial be made and it is that loop

11:04.840 --> 11:11.600
That allows our like universe to continue to interesting. Here is how bad that also doesn't benefit Justin though

11:12.480 --> 11:19.240
Badly, I've bungled this. Yeah, even if you were to go through to my tik-tok page. Here's what you would find

11:20.000 --> 11:25.240
My username is hoops McElroy. No, that is not my name. Okay, can't search that

11:25.240 --> 11:29.720
My icon is a picture of four chicken nuggets with their labels on them

11:29.720 --> 11:35.640
That's not helping make me and I have no bio. There's no way I have made the perfect

11:36.280 --> 11:40.840
Perfect dead end for content. There is no way I could benefit from this

11:41.320 --> 11:45.100
Yeah, you fucked it up, but I guarantee you juice

11:45.760 --> 11:47.240
Superbowl

11:47.240 --> 11:48.720
2022 oh

11:48.720 --> 11:51.320
Yeah, he's back. He's back in a big way

11:51.320 --> 11:56.120
It's like how it State Farm was like hey guys, remember Jake from State Farm now, he's back in all the shit

11:56.760 --> 12:01.520
Starburst is gonna be like one more ride Jack. He's like I can't I've talked so much shit

12:01.760 --> 12:06.960
But they're like check out this dope tik-tok. I can at least at least fix the bio. He at least fix the bio

12:07.600 --> 12:13.640

Justin could we?

12:25.800 --> 12:28.960
attempt to parlay this into you

12:29.880 --> 12:32.800
Becoming the next berries and cream spokesperson

12:33.520 --> 12:36.640
Right now you're now there's brand Association. I

12:38.040 --> 12:40.600
Can't overstate the extent to which

12:40.600 --> 12:46.560
This can't this doesn't help me at all. No, not without a little elbow grease

12:46.560 --> 12:50.280
You got might as well be anonymous. I get might as well be anonymous

12:51.160 --> 12:53.840
You you think anonymous can help you?

12:54.400 --> 13:01.720
Maybe anonymous could change that sound towards like Justin McElroy does different podcasts. You can listen to it and donate to him

13:02.280 --> 13:07.640
Listen, maybe they can all the anonymous can figure out a way to anonymous is listening. First of all, thank you

13:07.640 --> 13:14.600
We're flattered second of all any insight any help you can offer here as to how I guess we can

13:15.240 --> 13:18.880
Hack the berries and cream sounds. Yes

13:18.880 --> 13:24.440
Let us know please and the biggest outcome of this would be it is if Starburst brought back berries and cream

13:24.560 --> 13:27.280
Flavor fruit juice because those were pretty fucking good

13:27.280 --> 13:31.640
I think we can all agree and Justin if you could do something with tastations next and see

13:31.640 --> 13:38.160
Bring those love that. All right, please bring back tastations. All right, let's let's get let's do our show

13:38.160 --> 13:40.720
Yeah, so I don't know why you would listen to us

13:40.720 --> 13:43.640
No at this point like seeing how badly I've bungled this

13:43.640 --> 13:48.480
Well, they were checking to see if you would do more that berries and cream content that they love and hey, look at that

13:48.720 --> 13:52.400
We did you did it? Yeah, here I am. You've probably found your way

13:53.040 --> 13:57.640
To the podcast because I'm so famous from when I uploaded berries and cream that one time

13:57.640 --> 14:01.560
Yeah, it's so weird to listen back to this now that you're president in 2024

14:01.560 --> 14:07.080
Yeah, you know, it's like how do they get started? I will not benefit from this at all

14:07.080 --> 14:10.440
I've wasted it. I wasted my big shot at

14:10.920 --> 14:15.240
Like what this happens to people right like green shirt guy, right?

14:15.520 --> 14:21.660
You know green shirt guy who was in that one meme where he was laughing. Oh Ken bone. No, that's red. She

14:24.360 --> 14:28.640
It doesn't matter for my jokes they're both on cameo and like they're

14:28.640 --> 14:35.020
a green shirt guy who is laughing in that one meme is on cameo and he'll send the cameo to your friends and family but

14:35.020 --> 14:39.460
Like does he wear a green shirt? He has yes. We're a great shirt. Never video

14:40.080 --> 14:42.080
Um, I hope he's

14:43.560 --> 14:48.100
This week I'll tell you guys as I was putting the other question list, I think it really helps some people this week

14:49.040 --> 14:52.040
Got some real nice change of pay actionable emails

14:52.640 --> 14:57.720
I've been seeing my current partner for about two years. Most of it being long-distance due to kovat

14:57.720 --> 15:00.560
Oh, that's awkward timing. I know that's uncommon. Oh other people

15:01.080 --> 15:03.600
Who've been in that similar scenario? It's gonna be tough

15:04.280 --> 15:10.400
All right, a friend of mine told me that my partner is planning a surprise dirty 30 party for me

15:10.440 --> 15:13.760
The problem is I'm turning 29 this year not 30

15:19.600 --> 15:24.360
Why do we even need three of us anyway, I actually have stuff to do I

15:24.360 --> 15:26.360
I

15:26.680 --> 15:30.280
Tried laying down some hints for him, but he seems to think I'm pulling his leg

15:30.480 --> 15:35.520
Do I now need to spend the rest of my life pretending to be one year older than I am?

15:35.560 --> 15:37.920
That's too young in Youngstown, Ohio

15:38.640 --> 15:41.680
Well, this is okay. It's just occurred to me. I

15:42.600 --> 15:48.320
think a little bit of the wrinkle here is I think the pulling his leg is that like

15:48.320 --> 15:54.680
Media like inspire joke of like, oh, I'm not turning 30. I'm turning 29 again, right?

15:54.680 --> 16:00.040
Yes, exactly that kind of shit, right? I think that's it. But I cuz I was like, why would they think you're joking?

16:00.040 --> 16:06.520
It's not oh, okay now I get it because I think we can all agree 30 is a disgusting number and well

16:06.520 --> 16:10.200
I know it's like woof, right? I've said it

16:10.200 --> 16:15.040
I've said it before and I'll say it again turning 30 is great because you're the youngest old

16:15.040 --> 16:18.160
person yeah, like that's 30 you can like

16:18.600 --> 16:22.920
Actively complain about feeling old and nobody rolls their eyes anymore, but you're still young enough

16:23.320 --> 16:27.080
Yeah, you can like you could start you could start playing tennis

16:27.680 --> 16:29.680
Shines off that Apple by 40. Yeah

16:31.600 --> 16:36.600
You don't enjoy that shit I think and I think we can all get on board with this

16:37.080 --> 16:42.080
Is that when you're born you're one because you're in the first year

16:42.080 --> 16:50.120
Year. Oh, so you're you're talking about centuries versus like 19th century is like the 1800s on right centuries

16:50.840 --> 16:55.280
Exactly. Okay fucked up that we do that that way but not our age that way

16:55.440 --> 17:00.720
It is weird to say like oh that baby's zero this how many how many years old is your baby?

17:00.720 --> 17:03.440
Oh, my baby is five months old. I didn't ask that

17:04.080 --> 17:09.440
They're in their first year. They're one years old. So you are entering your 30th year, but they're not one years old

17:09.440 --> 17:12.000
Are they they're in their first year? But

17:13.120 --> 17:20.800
They're what Griffin is arguing is there it you're entering your 30th year. Yes, this begins your 30th. Yeah. No, I can see that

17:20.800 --> 17:27.220
That's for sure. That's definite. You don't say I have completed my 30th year. No, and now I

17:27.960 --> 17:33.360
Right, like that's weird. Also. I'm beginning my 30th planetary cycle

17:33.920 --> 17:36.880
Maybe the partner could be like, that's right. Oh

17:36.880 --> 17:43.280
Oh, yes, I knew this this this information related to me. I was aware of this. It's a year-long party. Oh

17:45.440 --> 17:50.940
You get it it's like a year-long party what's that mean juice well the party don't stop

17:52.160 --> 17:57.320
It's a celebration for you being 30. That's so monumental. Yeah, it has to start

17:58.520 --> 18:00.520
It has to start

18:00.560 --> 18:03.640
They at your previous birth. Okay, it's a year-long

18:04.440 --> 18:06.040
multi-tiered

18:06.040 --> 18:13.200
Dimensional pitch me a version of this that isn't terrible for us, please for me. Okay. Well not for Griffin specific

18:13.880 --> 18:20.600
Okay, so you anytime if you imagine your partner is having a birthday and it's a okay

18:20.600 --> 18:25.720
Yeah, and it's like a year long, right? Yes, so for one year

18:26.280 --> 18:31.740
Whenever there's conflict or anything approaching conflict in the relationship

18:31.740 --> 18:39.700
you don't have to do the mental calculus of should I be supporting my partner's needs or should I be looking after my own needs to

18:39.940 --> 18:44.300
Find that delicate balance that's key to any relationship. Yeah for one year

18:44.300 --> 18:50.780
You can just relax and really put yourself in the backseat. You know, I mean, there's no nobody could get me guff about it

18:50.900 --> 18:54.580
Because it's their birth. It's their birth year. Yeah now it's their birthday celebration

18:54.580 --> 18:58.340
It kind of feels a little bit like what you're saying Justin is like a year-long birthday party

18:58.340 --> 19:05.220
But in the sense of like birthday party parentheses observed in parentheses where it doesn't sound like there's a lot of

19:06.020 --> 19:10.540
Celebration occurring there are celebrations throughout but there's prizes

19:11.900 --> 19:13.900
What do you mean anything?

19:14.300 --> 19:19.540
well, what's cool is like for the whole year you can do whatever shady things you want to and

19:20.140 --> 19:22.980
What degree Justin if what do you do?

19:22.980 --> 19:28.220
Let me finish the thought and your you your partner is like, what are you even doing?

19:28.220 --> 19:29.700
You can just be like

19:29.700 --> 19:35.060
Coming up on the birthday should be asking some questions. Yeah, it's like why's your trunk smell like that?

19:35.060 --> 19:39.300
It's like birthday boy got a birthday. You got a b-day coming up. Mm-hmm

19:42.340 --> 19:44.500
No, it's promotional for dexter's back

19:48.220 --> 19:50.220
Celebration and also

19:50.740 --> 19:55.940
That actually what that one I will answer for you. I'm part of a dexter's back street team

19:55.940 --> 19:57.380
Mm-hmm

19:57.380 --> 20:03.020
Promoting dexter's so I'm leaving just you know some slides with blood on them all over town

20:03.420 --> 20:09.340
Some bloody knives all over town just whatever bloody stuff. I can find I leave it all over town

20:09.340 --> 20:13.140
Hey, did you fucking kill John let's go on our couch. Yeah, it's a dexter's

20:13.820 --> 20:15.660
laboratory

20:15.660 --> 20:18.300
promotional materials, yeah, I

20:19.620 --> 20:25.080
Haven't seen the show, but it's supposed to be really good and back so next year's back. Yeah this stinker he

20:25.080 --> 20:31.760
He doesn't like murder which is fucked up right because it's like it's quite a bit, huh?

20:32.120 --> 20:36.040
He's like Kathy, you know where he loves murder, but when he does it he's like

20:36.920 --> 20:38.520
Yeah

20:38.520 --> 20:40.600
You know, they're bringing dexter's back

20:41.320 --> 20:46.040
When they do it, he's gonna be on CBS. So they've had to tone it down

20:46.040 --> 20:49.840
So really what he does is he punches people?

20:49.840 --> 20:55.240
Yeah, but he can't let anybody know that he isn't because he's his job is that he's not a punch. Oh, yeah

20:55.800 --> 21:01.160
But he does if he finds a serial killer, whatever which that guy by the way, I know he's like technically

21:01.840 --> 21:08.160
Works at police but like that guy meets so many more serial killers than I do. Yeah, just per capita

21:08.160 --> 21:13.960
He's looking for them Justin and I know you well enough to say that you are actively trying to stay away from serial killers

21:14.160 --> 21:17.520
It is one of my key concepts for 2020

21:17.520 --> 21:19.120
It's one of your

21:19.120 --> 21:27.280
Every year you have the same year's resolution avoid more silly serial killers. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, can't beat a hundred percent

21:27.280 --> 21:32.280
That's where I've been. So yeah, I mean I assume right? Yeah, I was about to say I don't want to get too dark

21:32.280 --> 21:38.000
But like I don't know you've probably met a serial. Well, that's probably met a serial killer

21:38.000 --> 21:43.100
Hey, hey listener take a second and rewind your whole life and try to feel like

21:43.100 --> 21:48.540
At least one serial killer. That's why I have accepted that. I can't avoid all serial killers

21:48.540 --> 21:54.340
So I just try really hard to make myself not their type. You know, I mean, I'm just trying to be like, oh no

21:54.340 --> 21:58.340
I know not Travis though. Let him get through this thing

21:59.100 --> 22:01.100
Okay, so in closing

22:01.180 --> 22:03.860
Just say that you're nervous about turning

22:04.540 --> 22:10.140
30 in a year. Oh, man, it actually I just tried to bring it up in conversation and it doesn't work

22:10.140 --> 22:14.940
Yeah, theoretically, it's tough. Yeah. Hey partner. I heard that you're planning a surprise party for me

22:14.940 --> 22:18.660
I just want to make it clear to you. No, no, no, no, you've ruined it. You've ruined it

22:19.900 --> 22:23.680
Fucking terrible. Yeah, no kidding Travis, but we don't get to be the arbiter of that

22:24.740 --> 22:26.900
Just let it just do it. It'll be a fun story

22:26.900 --> 22:33.020
Oh look at that my grandmother confused the months and she sent me a birthday card earlier in here

22:33.020 --> 22:39.020
Ah, but as she's written here, happy 29th. Thank you. I have a solution to this

22:39.020 --> 22:44.380
Your friend ruined the surprise, right? Yeah, your friend needs to fix this

22:44.460 --> 22:48.300
Yes, if they ruin the surprise your friend needs to go back to him be like hey

22:48.300 --> 22:54.020
Listen, this didn't occur to me before when I it definitely did occur to me and I was just too scared to mention it

22:54.060 --> 23:01.900
But like they are turning 29 like there is no reality in which this should be a dirty 30-party fix it. Yeah

23:02.460 --> 23:05.900
Make them fix you are right Justin and you should say it. I

23:05.900 --> 23:13.060
I mean you did just say I oh, yeah, but I mean that's it. I think it's the thing people say hey thinking speaking of

23:13.620 --> 23:14.820
avoiding

23:14.820 --> 23:21.860
Getting murdered. Can we approach the wizard because I have more life-saving. I feel like this segment has stopped being like a humor

23:22.740 --> 23:24.740
column and more like a

23:25.140 --> 23:30.580
Slumdog slumdog millionaire like little seeds that I'm planting in the listeners mind

23:30.580 --> 23:34.460
so that when they do face off against the charging ostrich, they like

23:34.460 --> 23:41.380
Know what to do weirdly like our best chance to actually help. Yeah in like a game like a really important way

23:41.820 --> 23:48.300
Our best chance to have somebody like oh, it's a life that exactly write us into their will or something like right, you know

23:48.820 --> 23:53.740
Seven like seven or eight people sent this in. Thank you how to survive an encounter with a ostrich

23:54.220 --> 24:00.580
They can be found in the wild on safaris or on ostrich farms. I feel like if you are

24:00.980 --> 24:02.980
If you get into this scenario

24:02.980 --> 24:10.580
It's mostly on you. I don't typically find myself in places where ostriches are

24:12.340 --> 24:14.740
You know what I mean, they're not well

24:15.540 --> 24:19.820
Here's the thing. I agree with you Griffin if you go to an ostrich farm and you get attacked

24:20.260 --> 24:24.640
But what I'm saying is with zoos and transports and such

24:25.020 --> 24:31.820
The chances of an ostrich appearing in my backyard are very very very small, but not zero

24:31.820 --> 24:39.260
Yeah, that's fair. I guess you know what I mean. We got the Cincinnati zoo right here. Yeah, I'm gonna escape one could escape

24:39.260 --> 24:45.740
I'm not saying that it has please don't freak out everyone in the Cincinnati area, but I'm saying oh you know

24:45.740 --> 24:51.460
Oh, yeah, so monkeys got away here recently and it was a huge news story. Is that true?

24:51.620 --> 24:56.060
Yeah, there was another wiki how article people sent in about how to survive a monkey attack

24:56.060 --> 24:58.560
Maybe we'll do that one. Maybe we'll do that one next time

24:58.560 --> 25:04.880
But I feel like the ostrich is scarier because guess what? I'm gonna just start reading about method one evading and charging ostrich

25:04.880 --> 25:08.400
Look for cover because these motherfuckers can run up to 43 miles an hour

25:11.320 --> 25:18.200
It's so fast that's quite fast you guys got those weird legs so how do they do that? Yeah, it's it's I yeah

25:18.200 --> 25:24.820
I don't even think about it. The ostrich is like the roadrunner's legs. Yes, exactly. They go they windmill

25:24.820 --> 25:30.100
You got to get somewhere that they is gonna just break their break their stride

25:31.100 --> 25:35.180
They're so much faster than you and they'll kick you in the back and then you're pretty much dead hide

25:35.340 --> 25:41.360
Yeah, conceal yourself ostrich fast pretty stupid. So you got that going for you?

25:41.780 --> 25:46.000
Another thing ostrich can't do is fly get up a tree. That's if you fly away

25:46.100 --> 25:51.660
You're fine. If you fly away is fine ostrich can't stand up to seven and nine feet tall. So make it a big tree

25:51.660 --> 25:55.220
I don't have teeth. That's a bonus

25:55.220 --> 25:59.860
It can jab at you with its beak and upset your balance and once you get into foot town

26:00.420 --> 26:03.900
Once you hit foot range of the ostrich, that's the ball game

26:04.500 --> 26:06.560
Here's a fun one dive into a thorn bush

26:07.260 --> 26:12.420
It sucks. It sucks. You know, what else being is sucks getting disemboweled by a ostrich

26:12.740 --> 26:18.620
Jump right in a thorn bush and ostrich will be like and now that's no. Thanks. Just a quick one

26:18.620 --> 26:20.620
I think sometimes we

26:20.620 --> 26:26.180
We people who are not around ostriches routinely. Yeah, I think of them as a little bit doofy

26:26.700 --> 26:28.700
but as you've been

26:28.860 --> 26:34.740
Describing the ostrich. I'm reminded that birds of all from you know dinosaurs. Oh for sure for sure for sure

26:36.820 --> 26:42.100
And the last thing to do if just all else fails you can't get up a tree or hide or whatever just lay on the ground

26:42.540 --> 26:45.460
And you think like oh, it's just gonna leave you alone

26:45.460 --> 26:52.260
No, it's gonna still beat the shit out of you, but it's gonna be apparently a little bit better because the force of an ostrich

26:52.260 --> 26:54.700
His kick is dramatically reduced when you lay down, right?

26:55.220 --> 26:58.500
Because they kick forward and then downward so, you know

26:58.500 --> 27:03.900
They the tap they are going to scratch your it says lay in your stomach to protect your organs

27:03.900 --> 27:05.900
I don't really know how to prioritize

27:06.900 --> 27:12.540
Them when I'm doing that, but I guess if you're worried about disembowelment, that's gonna be tummy area

27:12.540 --> 27:19.020
That's gonna be I guess tummy town and also hey, you're also not safe from the ostrich sitting on you because these bad boys can

27:19.020 --> 27:23.240
Weigh between 200 and 350 pounds who walking fuck Wow

27:23.860 --> 27:27.040
So that's how to evade an ostrich. So

27:28.060 --> 27:35.300
How to calm them down, right? Well, no actually before that Travis step two is a section that is

27:35.660 --> 27:38.380
It features some of the wildest illustrations

27:38.380 --> 27:45.660
that I've ever seen on I was gonna say on wiki how but really in any sort of

27:45.980 --> 27:51.140
Format and it's how to fend off an ostrich how to battle

27:51.660 --> 27:58.500
How to battle a ostrich wait in the avoiding damage section. Does it mention that you should stop carrying around?

27:58.500 --> 28:00.740
It's giant egg like an old-timey football guy

28:01.260 --> 28:05.940
That I feel like gets you in trouble a lot of your head like Mario too. Yeah

28:05.940 --> 28:11.820
They hate both of those because you seem like you are gonna drop it. I'm just uploading some cool pictures of people

28:13.340 --> 28:17.340
Hitting an ostrich with a big stick. Okay, so you find a long weapon

28:18.860 --> 28:23.100
Boy out of context. This is terrible. You gotta get a lot

28:23.100 --> 28:26.180
No, there's nothing funny about hurting animals unless it's a life-or-death situation

28:26.580 --> 28:31.860
You got to stay to the ostrich's side with your long weapon and these images a person is holding a long stick like a kendo

28:31.860 --> 28:33.860
stick their form is

28:33.860 --> 28:35.860
Impeccable to be honest

28:36.060 --> 28:42.340
And then it just has like this is like the scene in signs where he just swings away, right?

28:42.340 --> 28:47.960
But it's like if it's like his sister-in-law just kept saying like hey when that ostrich comes around

28:48.820 --> 28:52.880
Billy or whatever swing away. The wiki article here has literally

28:54.220 --> 29:00.460
Demonstrated the glowing weak points on the ostrich. There's neck. That's the weakest part of the ostrich clearly

29:00.460 --> 29:04.540
I don't think you need a way if you are in this situation and you're like, okay, I have fuck

29:04.540 --> 29:06.740
I don't know what paths I followed to get me here

29:06.740 --> 29:08.860
But I'm about to fight this ostrich with a big stick

29:08.980 --> 29:10.420
Where am I gonna aim this thing?

29:10.420 --> 29:16.780
If you if you don't jump to neck if you don't jump to that long beautiful graceful powerful, but

29:17.500 --> 29:21.780
Somewhat fragile neck like what else what are you gonna do? That could be a trick though

29:21.780 --> 29:25.440
You know where you look at you're like, I bet that's the weak point. It's like ha ha idiot

29:25.440 --> 29:30.840
Yeah, I've evolved to have like an iron neck. Yeah, well should have gone for my butt

29:31.200 --> 29:33.760
There's more tips here. Actually the next thing in the order

29:33.760 --> 29:40.320
It says here if the ostrich refuses to give up despite your attacks to its neck aim for its wings when given the opportunity if the ostrich

29:40.600 --> 29:45.040
Refuses to give up after you struck it in the neck with a big stick several times

29:45.760 --> 29:47.240
Yeah

29:47.240 --> 29:50.640
Give yourself to it. Yeah feed yourself to it

29:50.640 --> 29:58.440
You've clearly done something that has like done a kill bill style life like sworn oath on you

29:58.440 --> 30:02.960
This is the only thing you have left now is you get to choose to die with honor to this

30:05.880 --> 30:12.240
Yes, allow the ostrich a five-finger death punch you or whatever and then you slowly walk away into the sunset

30:12.240 --> 30:17.920
The ostrich will nod to you knowingly and one warrior to another before it eviscerates you

30:17.920 --> 30:22.120
It'll get a chance to straighten your tie before ripping your guts out

30:22.120 --> 30:28.080
Isn't that better though then you like swinging this stupid stick after you'd have you struck it and it's beautiful powerful neck

30:28.080 --> 30:30.080
And it's not fazed by it and you're like

30:30.320 --> 30:36.600
And then you get murdered. No go for the legs anything after a neck attack is like completely excessive

30:36.600 --> 30:42.200
You are not gonna reach you guys agree that like if I Justin McElroy at this point in my life

30:42.200 --> 30:49.480
I'm the victim of an ostrich attack. It's a societal problem. Okay, there's been an

30:50.280 --> 30:51.360
systemic

30:51.360 --> 30:53.560
Something that's gone horrible roll. Yeah

30:54.120 --> 30:55.720
infrastructure has

30:55.720 --> 30:56.520
failed me

30:56.520 --> 31:00.740
it can't be my fault that I'm getting attacked by an ostrich because like

31:00.940 --> 31:06.160
the people that have ostriches and the people that are charged with looking after my welfare should

31:06.160 --> 31:10.600
Have collaborated to keep me from this situation

31:10.600 --> 31:11.360
There should be yes

31:11.360 --> 31:16.280
There should be lines of defense between you and ostrich and if those have fallen apart

31:16.640 --> 31:22.640
There are larger issues at play here. Yeah. Yes. Yeah, but I understand if I am killed by an ostrich

31:22.640 --> 31:28.480
I want there to be like an investigation and like I want AOC to open up an investigation in Congress

31:28.480 --> 31:30.480
Like how do we fail our boy so bad?

31:30.480 --> 31:37.380
I'll tell you what this happened to our boy now my worry is that if those lines have broken down as Justin suggests and I get

31:37.380 --> 31:40.280
Killed as an ostrich. I might not even make the news

31:40.560 --> 31:45.880
No, right if that is like an etc of like horrible stuff has happened

31:46.800 --> 31:53.900
See page 10 flip flip flip Travis McRae was killed terrible news tonight as the brother of the guy that uploaded

31:53.900 --> 31:55.900
The

31:58.460 --> 32:04.140
The only things that are left is there's two different tips saying stay the fuck away from ostriches and then there's one extra one

32:04.140 --> 32:08.060
That says stay the fuck away from ostriches, especially during breeding season. Oh

32:08.980 --> 32:14.820
Yeah, I know when that is. Yeah, if I knew an ostrich breeding season was I've probably been smart enough to avoid putting myself

32:14.820 --> 32:16.100
in this

32:16.100 --> 32:18.100
ostrich and then like oh

32:18.140 --> 32:21.460
Like get out of there get out of that's weird

32:21.460 --> 32:25.100
I smell I smell feathers and axe body spray. Oh, no

32:26.340 --> 32:31.740
But nowhere in there Griffin. Is it how to calm down the ostrich? No your options are

32:32.700 --> 32:34.180
Stay away

32:34.180 --> 32:37.860
The order of this article is so fucking weird because it's like hide

32:38.500 --> 32:40.500
Run away if that doesn't work

32:41.220 --> 32:44.540
Doesn't work fucking hit it with a stick and it's glowing weak points

32:44.540 --> 32:48.020
But for real though, you should probably just stay away from these guys

32:48.020 --> 32:55.620
I like this idea that the ostrich is like a destiny to like boss fight of like aim for the glowing spot. Yeah

32:56.500 --> 32:59.060
They are really given this ostrich to the business

32:59.420 --> 33:02.580
It's three different people in these pictures to the shakes

33:02.580 --> 33:06.780
It looks like it's three people ganging up and like you didn't think I'll take the wing

33:06.780 --> 33:13.100
It's like the printer scene in office space, but with an ostrich instead. It's horrible. They should be arrested

33:13.100 --> 33:18.860
They should and the ostrich too just for questioning at least. Yeah, well for its own protection, really

33:19.700 --> 33:24.620
Though this world isn't built for an ostrich. It's not the ostriches fault that it got out here and panicked

33:25.180 --> 33:28.280
I mean it's a ostriches world. We're all just living in it

33:28.420 --> 33:33.540
No, I agree with you Griffin if I run into the ostrich on its native like habitat

33:33.540 --> 33:40.100
But if an ostrich gets out of the Cincinnati Zoo and finds itself like an OTR or whatever freaks out

33:40.100 --> 33:45.700
Everyone has to accept that like fuck. Yeah that ostrich freaked out. It doesn't understand any of this

33:45.940 --> 33:51.020
Why why why is the parking so expensive? How come the restaurants are all so small?

33:51.020 --> 33:55.740
Why is there a 45-minute wait right that kind of shit it runs up on me in a Trader Joe's?

33:56.340 --> 33:58.340
And I'm like you're in my world now

33:58.740 --> 34:04.140
Welcome to my world and you hit it with a baguette and then I get up right with a bag out right in the face

34:04.380 --> 34:05.860
Yeah with a baguette

34:05.860 --> 34:11.260

Welcome on squad the podcast within a podcast

38:40.540 --> 38:45.100
Podcast profiling the latest and greatest of brand eating. There is a I mean

38:46.220 --> 38:48.220
everyone decided to just

38:48.220 --> 38:51.660
Like Jack it back up like the munch

38:52.060 --> 38:56.260
My thing today that I'm gonna say to you is the munchies back because people are going wild

38:56.260 --> 39:00.060
Do you think they were waiting? This could be where we saw started to see like

39:00.540 --> 39:04.740
You remember when it seemed like code was going away and we saw the push into

39:04.740 --> 39:12.620
into like some like travel and some of those other sectors and then it seemed like Delta was like back and then it's like

39:12.820 --> 39:18.380
Maybe the stay-at-home brands are where we want to keep the bulk of our sort of interests. Yes. Sure. Sure

39:18.380 --> 39:21.000
Yeah, I think this is kind of where we're at right now where it's like

39:21.700 --> 39:26.300
This is a flush of people thinking like time to get nasty again, you know what I mean?

39:27.740 --> 39:32.740
Where's also sucked a lot of the oxygen out of the room. Yeah. Well guess who's trying to start it back up

39:32.740 --> 39:34.740
You're fucking kidding me

39:34.860 --> 39:36.860
Taco Bell what?

39:38.060 --> 39:42.020
Taco Bell is unleashing and it says unleash and they know

39:43.500 --> 39:48.760
They know they're unleashing the crispy chicken sandwich

39:50.180 --> 39:52.180
Talk now already knows

39:52.900 --> 39:56.580
Nationwide on September 2nd. You can't just do that

39:56.580 --> 40:02.380
He the words mean something Taco Bell beginning September 2nd Taco Bell's long-awaited

40:03.020 --> 40:09.140
Crispy chicken sandwich taco will be available nationwide and participating locations for a limited time

40:09.180 --> 40:15.100
Not quite a sandwich not quite a taco. It doesn't have to explain itself. It does

40:16.540 --> 40:25.060
After locally testing earlier this year in Nashville and Charlotte to much success the test kitchen masterminds knew it was time to go nationwide

40:25.060 --> 40:31.740
Pull the trigger fluffy. Okay. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Sorry. We've talked about this before in episode 550

40:31.740 --> 40:34.900
We talked about this. Yes, my friend. Yes

40:35.340 --> 40:41.680
This is now nationwide that we have not talked about the the fat wait 550. Yeah, bud

40:42.140 --> 40:45.140
Yeah, this was the test. That was the test. It's it's here

40:45.860 --> 40:50.740
It's not fluffy like a sandwich but folded like it. It's fluffy like a sandwich. Yeah

40:50.740 --> 40:55.060
Yeah, but it's folded like a taco. Mm-hmm. No

40:55.580 --> 40:59.900
No, I stand by I think what my position back then looking at a picture of these bad boys now

40:59.900 --> 41:01.900
Which is that I would fuck them up proper

41:02.180 --> 41:06.540
I'm looking at it again. I'm getting hungry all over. I would ruin these bad boys

41:07.100 --> 41:14.500
They're the crispy chicken sandwich taco is a taco or a sandwich might just be the greatest debate of recent time

41:14.500 --> 41:18.060
Oh, yeah, I think it might just be according this press release

41:18.060 --> 41:20.060
in

41:20.100 --> 41:21.380
2021

41:21.380 --> 41:25.500
Whether this is a taco or a sandwich might just be the greatest

41:25.980 --> 41:33.380
Debate of recent time and that's why Taco Bell has enlisted some of the brightest minds in the country to help fans

41:33.500 --> 41:35.500
James Carville

41:35.500 --> 42:02.020
Now now listen, it's me, Ben Shapiro, I say it's a sandwich. It's a me! It's a taco have identity politics. It's a sandwich. It's a me. I'm Ben Shapiro. Now back to my toilet where I live.

42:02.020 --> 42:10.780
I need to find some way of saying it's a taco that reveals like it is also the most brutal self demolishing own

42:11.340 --> 42:14.580
Possible because that is his brand is like trying to chuck one

42:14.580 --> 42:18.940
He like he does an air ball and then it bounces off the rim and gives him a concussion

42:20.540 --> 42:22.540
So

42:22.540 --> 42:27.780
It's gotta be a taco because when I ate it I got diarrhea for six hours that only happens when I eat tacos

42:27.780 --> 42:35.500
You're right. That's right on September 4th Taco Bell will use two real college debate teams from the University of Georgia and Clemson University

42:36.020 --> 42:42.500
To go head-to-head in the name of team. It's a sandwich and team. It's a taco. Oh boy

42:47.820 --> 42:53.420
The great crispy chicken sandwich taco debate will air Saturday September 4th

42:53.420 --> 42:58.380
During the Georgia vs. Clemson primetime college football game on NBC. Oh

42:59.120 --> 43:01.120
record numbers, it's it's

43:01.460 --> 43:05.740
What they have done here is they have wandered into the chicken sandwich wars

43:06.300 --> 43:09.580
that is what bothers and yes, and while everybody else is like

43:09.580 --> 43:15.540
Ah a new opponent a new contender enters the battlefield, but Taco Bell is like hold up

43:16.180 --> 43:19.600
Because we have our own drama that we need to like

43:19.600 --> 43:23.600
Figure out first, please. Don't don't go on the attack

43:23.600 --> 43:29.560
Nobody else is allowed to announce a chicken taco until we figure out this shit and do some real soul searching

43:29.560 --> 43:36.600
It's like it's like you can't decide if it's a taco or it's a it's a sandwich. Okay. Well one of them

43:37.200 --> 43:41.920
Will enter you into will thrust you into an international

43:41.920 --> 43:49.320
Conflict that has I will reiterate for maybe the dozenth time claimed human lives

43:51.880 --> 43:58.480
Again I feel like I'm losing it with this thing, but people have done. Okay, it's not a joke

43:59.200 --> 44:04.520
One of them enters you into that. The other one is like, I don't know. It's another bad taco

44:04.520 --> 44:08.360
We did it or like it'll still be good. I mean bad in the sense of like

44:08.360 --> 44:12.240
It's not a it's not a taco, but it stopped

44:12.960 --> 44:20.240
You just no no Travis. It's important that we take a beat here and appreciate what Justin just did which is

44:21.400 --> 44:24.320
Throw. Oh, I tried to like through your hat in the ring a little bit

44:24.320 --> 44:26.000
I see my hat there a I mean

44:26.000 --> 44:32.120
But it ain't a sandwich either as Hodgman that somebody get a Hodgman on the phone and ask you what they want Hodgman though

44:32.120 --> 44:36.000
They want Hodgman for free juice and we're not gonna like that

44:36.000 --> 44:37.440
I

44:37.440 --> 44:40.580
Want to get I'm gonna text don't you don't know how I feel about the fact that

44:40.880 --> 44:44.600
we've been doing Munchquad now for a long time and it's reached a point where

44:45.400 --> 44:51.040
The fact that Taco Bell has enlisted human beings and let's human youths

44:51.560 --> 44:55.240
To debate whether a thing they made

44:56.160 --> 45:00.120
It's a taco or a sandwich on live

45:00.120 --> 45:07.720
television they should know yeah, I don't know you're asking me right it should bother me, but

45:08.320 --> 45:13.800
Instead I'm just left empty inside and thinking like well. Yep. This is where we are

45:13.960 --> 45:19.480
where was this indecisiveness when they announced the naked chicken taco where the chicken was the

45:19.760 --> 45:25.200
Was the the shell the tortilla they knew what they were they made that they made that fucking

45:25.200 --> 45:31.400
Monstrosity and they were like this ladies and gentlemen this folks. This is definitely a taco

45:32.120 --> 45:34.840
Right here. Why just while we're here

45:34.840 --> 45:40.200
I just want to mention a couple of other things and I don't want to like outstay my welcome here with Munchquad

45:40.440 --> 45:42.440
But there's a lot going on. Okay

45:43.320 --> 45:47.240
Sonic is doing a lineup of wine inspired slush. Yes

45:47.800 --> 45:49.800
excellent

45:49.800 --> 45:51.200
fantastic

45:51.200 --> 45:58.280
This free well, it's that thing of like I want to capture the the feeling of drinking frozen wine

45:58.360 --> 46:04.760
That doesn't get me dry. Yeah, that's I love that stinky fruit flavor. They got strawberry for a say

46:05.480 --> 46:12.000
Red berry sangria and peach Bellini. That's not gonna get confusing at all when people see that

46:13.000 --> 46:17.840
Well, why would it be confusing? It's just it's a peach Bellini that doesn't

46:17.840 --> 46:19.840
Yeah

46:19.840 --> 46:21.640
It's a sangria

46:21.640 --> 46:27.880
Which I believe is only a term used for the alcoholic drink, right? Not yet

46:28.520 --> 46:30.520
It's not that one. No

46:30.720 --> 46:31.720
and

46:31.720 --> 46:37.800
Then I did want to I just have one other thing to talk to you guys about and that's that pumpkin month

46:38.640 --> 46:40.640
It's coming up

46:40.920 --> 46:45.280
Starbucks just decided to pop it off August 24th, which I think is ridiculous

46:45.280 --> 46:50.920
we are a month away from calendar fall and a week away from Justin fall and

46:51.560 --> 46:54.560
I I don't think that this is the appropriate time

46:54.560 --> 46:58.840
I think you need to start wait till the beginning of Justin fall or calendar

47:00.160 --> 47:02.160
15th says correct

47:02.680 --> 47:09.960
Fall September 1st. Nope fog is 15. Yes. That's back to school season. No one cares. Nobody cares

47:09.960 --> 47:17.640
Yes PSL. Hey just for fun. Yes. How many PSL do you guys think Starbucks is sold since 2003 2003 1 billion?

47:18.280 --> 47:19.960
Okay, I'll say

47:19.960 --> 47:21.720
600 million

47:21.720 --> 47:23.120
Wow

47:23.120 --> 47:30.160
500 million excellent job. Thank you. I still went over and lost. Yeah, he was over by 20 percent. Just that's not that good

47:30.160 --> 47:37.080
Last last year if you'll remember Starbucks had a 1-800 number. Do you guys remember this where you could call?

47:37.080 --> 47:40.640
Oh, I remember. Yes. Oh, yeah. Yeah pumpkin jokes or something

47:41.400 --> 47:45.860
Today, there is a this year. We got a pumpkin level meter

47:46.600 --> 47:52.680
It's a quiz and we're gonna find out where you guys fall who wants to say I do for Travis me me me. Oh, perfect

47:52.680 --> 47:58.160
Here we go. Which which would you get for a first tattoo? Trav a heart-shaped pumpkin?

47:59.000 --> 48:00.880
What uh-huh?

48:00.880 --> 48:04.280
Okay, a heart shape. Yeah, you know pumpkin in the shape of a heart a

48:04.280 --> 48:07.840
PSL on your tongue so you can always taste it a

48:09.160 --> 48:14.640
Pumpkin cream cold brew goes here on your palm or a full flannel sleeve. Oh

48:15.680 --> 48:20.080
Please try to answer honest. Uh, I think of those four full flannel sleeve

48:21.160 --> 48:26.480
Okay, that would be uh, it seems like all those would be something that a pumpkin fan would do

48:26.840 --> 48:32.120
What would you do if your significant other proposed with a pumpkin cream cold brew?

48:32.120 --> 48:36.000
Oh, fuck would you would you take the drink and run?

48:36.680 --> 48:38.680

48:39.640 --> 48:45.000
Pumpkin is my significant allow or post a photo in the leaf rakers

48:45.520 --> 48:50.500
Society ASAP, huh? I think I'd take the drink and run would be my honest answer

48:52.120 --> 48:57.600
It seems like it I kind of thought this would be about like how much do you like pumpkin

48:57.600 --> 49:03.260
Trav, what's the first thing you do after arriving at a pumpkin patch? Oh take a shit

49:04.600 --> 49:06.440
pumpkin patch

49:06.440 --> 49:08.440
photoshoot give him pumpkin

49:09.920 --> 49:11.920
Is that a separate answer?

49:15.120 --> 49:20.200
Semi-colon give him pumpkin to talk about. I was so worried that that was a separate answer

49:20.840 --> 49:22.840
Pumpkin patch photoshoot comma

49:22.840 --> 49:30.240
Give them pumpkin to talk about calm. Okay, it says this it's a semi-colon actually pumpkin patch foot, which I don't think it's being

49:30.600 --> 49:31.680
used here

49:31.680 --> 49:38.760
But whatever it's a it's it's a it's a AI cloud generated quiz spend hours hunting for the perfect pumpkin

49:39.440 --> 49:41.440
hours hunting for the perfect pumpkin

49:43.000 --> 49:48.440
Grab as many pumpkins as you can fit into your car and then some so I don't

49:48.440 --> 49:53.740
Break my car? Shatter my car's windows with the pressure the internal pressure

49:53.740 --> 49:58.400
I'm gonna duct tape them to the top right and then this was probably the wildest one of all

49:58.880 --> 50:01.880
Get your pumpkins and go. Wow. Okay, that's awesome

50:03.120 --> 50:05.120
So what this is implying is a very

50:05.880 --> 50:07.880
mechanical very austere

50:09.280 --> 50:11.280
Yeah, dutifully

50:12.400 --> 50:14.400
No, no more chat I'm

50:14.400 --> 50:19.960
I'm leaving now to return. I'll be honest fellas. It's hard for me to move on from give them pumpkin to talk about

50:19.960 --> 50:22.840
I mean, that's the answer pumpkin to talk about is really

50:23.880 --> 50:28.000
Yes, I wanted to reflect you as I get the first thing I do when I get to a pumpkin patch

50:28.000 --> 50:32.400
I'm taking some photos for the gram to give them pumpkin to talk about. Of course. That's actually probably true

50:33.860 --> 50:37.200
Something to talk about by Bonnie Ray is a song about people

50:38.640 --> 50:43.240
Spreading rumors that you and somebody else is is is our lover. Yes

50:43.240 --> 50:49.920
Yes, so oh so Griffin are you saying that this is implying that I'm taking this photo shoot and be we're gonna say like is

50:49.920 --> 50:54.760
Travis fucking that pumpkin. I think it looks like in this picture. He's fucking the pumpkin. Yeah, that's what I do

51:00.680 --> 51:04.180
Would you ever name your pet pumpkin I

51:04.920 --> 51:06.640
already did

51:06.640 --> 51:08.520
BRB changing their name

51:08.520 --> 51:14.080
My pet is a pumpkin. No fourth answer provided. Oh boy. So

51:15.320 --> 51:18.240
Again, would you name your pet pumpkin? I already did

51:19.500 --> 51:21.500
BRB changing their name

51:21.560 --> 51:25.440
My pet is a pumpkin. How are you supposed to judge your pumpkin love with these?

51:25.440 --> 51:30.560
Yeah, where's the fourth one like hypothetically I would if that name fit with that particular pet

51:30.560 --> 51:35.520
It's like seemed like a good name for I I guess my answer would be of those three

51:35.520 --> 51:37.280
Uh

51:37.280 --> 51:43.360
BRB I'll just change your name. Would you rather let a stranger hold your PSL or hold your baby?

51:44.720 --> 51:48.400
Right. No third or fourth options provided

51:48.400 --> 51:53.960
Um, I guess the answer would be that I'd let him hold my PSL because if they ran away with that

51:53.960 --> 52:02.480
It's a lot easier to replace sure. Wait is PSL penis leash. Yeah. Okay. Wait, what what's the S for there Justin?

52:02.480 --> 52:04.480
Penis of penis

52:16.280 --> 52:21.480
Wanna let him hold your PSL or your baby? Oh, well, then it's definitely my PSL if that's the case

52:22.040 --> 52:24.600
Cuz why else have it? Why else would I have it?

52:25.680 --> 52:30.520
You're not gonna hold your own. No. Why would I have that? It's for other people

52:30.520 --> 52:32.080
Oh

52:32.080 --> 52:33.480
POV

52:33.480 --> 52:34.640
POV

52:34.640 --> 52:36.640
You're lost in the corn maze. Yeah

52:37.120 --> 52:39.120
How are you getting out?

52:41.920 --> 52:43.920
This one's an essay

52:44.760 --> 52:52.180
Yeah, right the plan your plan your route I'm probably not getting out tbh no or follow the smell of penis leash

52:53.720 --> 52:55.400
Well, I'm not a defeatist

52:55.400 --> 53:01.220
So I guess I'm gonna go with penis leash here when the real answer the third one would be just start charging forward

53:01.600 --> 53:03.600
Through the corn. It's for help

53:04.400 --> 53:11.540
What pumpkin item would we most likely find in your closet and it says no judgment. Oh wait

53:12.400 --> 53:13.400
a

53:13.400 --> 53:15.800
pair of shoes carved from actual pumpkins. Oh

53:17.600 --> 53:19.720
Pumpkin fashion isn't my passion a

53:21.160 --> 53:23.160
Pumpkin onesie

53:23.160 --> 53:28.040
Or a vintage pumpkin patchwork jacket the vintage pumpkin patchwork jacket

53:28.040 --> 53:33.400
Then there needs to be more options in this quiz. That's like I don't actually really like the pumpkin spice

53:33.400 --> 53:37.000
That's what the second one is. The second was like, no, you know what on second thought

53:37.000 --> 53:41.720
I know I've made it pretty far through this quiz, but actually fuck pumpkins and not in a fire

53:42.360 --> 53:46.800
This is the last one. Okay, Trav. You make your way to the pumpkin prom

53:47.480 --> 53:49.480
What move are you busting out?

53:49.480 --> 53:53.460
An organized fall flash mob a

53:54.800 --> 53:57.120
series of perfect pumpkin pirouettes

53:58.600 --> 54:00.740
The pop lock and pumpkin

54:02.440 --> 54:09.280
Not my style I'll be by the pumpkin punch. It's that one not my style be the by the pumpkin punch ball

54:10.520 --> 54:15.880
Because if I'm being honest, I was always a little nervous that dances, but I did love punch

54:15.880 --> 54:19.800
the results are in Travis, huh

54:21.040 --> 54:28.800
You are a secret pumpkin admirer. Okay. This is the second to least you can like

54:31.200 --> 54:34.900
The second to least you can like pumpkins is secret pumpkin Meyer

54:35.400 --> 54:38.880
Even though you don't fully embrace the pumpkin loving lifestyle

54:38.920 --> 54:44.880
It's hard to ignore that tingly feeling you get inside whenever you get your hands on one again

54:44.880 --> 54:50.160
By that we mean a pumpkin get your hands on a pumpkin and you tangle. Don't worry

54:50.160 --> 54:53.800
We won't tell if you don't want us to it can be our little

54:54.880 --> 55:00.800
Pumpkin spice fill you can cook that pumpkin until the cows come home and we're gonna keep it quiet here at Starbucks

55:00.920 --> 55:06.920
TM that that is until you share this with your followers, then it just says you can share now. Oh

55:08.040 --> 55:10.760
What is the least you can like pumpkin there?

55:10.760 --> 55:16.520
Yeah, well Travis a scientific quiz. I can't just move the needle to where it point

55:16.520 --> 55:20.720
Yeah, I would just love it if like the least option is just like well you fucking got us

55:21.400 --> 55:23.400
Hey, we got caramel macchiato

55:24.560 --> 55:26.560
Come in for a plain black coffee, okay

55:27.720 --> 55:29.720
So anyway, that's the bunch quad

55:29.800 --> 55:32.800
Do we want to do one other question real quick?

55:33.400 --> 55:35.400
Yeah, okay. I

55:35.540 --> 55:38.720
Was recently able to order one of the new Xbox nice

55:38.720 --> 55:40.440
nice

55:40.440 --> 55:45.160
Nice nice during checkout the estimated arrival was sometime in the middle of next week great

55:45.160 --> 55:51.840
I recently got an email that shipping have been expedited and it would now be arriving this Saturday also great right wrong Saturday

55:51.840 --> 55:52.960
Is my fiancee's birthday?

55:52.960 --> 56:01.160
How can I avoid explaining to my fiancee that I bought myself a new present for her birthday some additional context something similar happened last?

56:01.160 --> 56:06.640
Year, we're ended up buying myself a new bicycle on her birthday. I don't know how this keeps happening

56:06.640 --> 56:08.400
Hmm

56:08.400 --> 56:11.400
Conflicted about Cortana in Kentucky. I

56:11.880 --> 56:16.200
Know hide-and-lie, and that's not a bad. That's not a terrible one to do

56:18.200 --> 56:20.200
On the spectrum of of

56:21.040 --> 56:25.560
Fibs is you know hiding away squirreling away your Xbox for a couple days

56:26.440 --> 56:29.640
To make it seem like it arrived when it was supposed to arrive

56:29.640 --> 56:36.400
Oh, that's a victimless crime, but if you don't want to do that. I do think you just got to get a better present than

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
the Xbox

56:39.080 --> 56:41.400
Good fucking luck because I mean

56:42.720 --> 56:45.640
Master chief blinks the time sweeper

56:46.560 --> 56:53.040
Banjo-kazooie, it's like how are you gonna be you can't be that's the that's the dream team right there

56:53.040 --> 56:56.200
You can't beat that at this point pretty soon

56:56.200 --> 57:02.360
You're gonna be married right at which point 50% of your stuff will be theirs anyways legally. Just give them the Xbox

57:03.320 --> 57:05.320
like

57:06.040 --> 57:11.640
That's that seems bad though. It's like I know you won't like this as much as me, but here it is

57:11.640 --> 57:13.640
It's a gift for you

57:13.840 --> 57:16.980
Now here's the problem. Okay. Here's the problem question asker

57:16.980 --> 57:23.340
Is that a year ago you preemptively fucked this up by getting yourself a bike on their birthday that you could have

57:23.340 --> 57:27.940
Easily not done now. This is happening

57:28.460 --> 57:34.060
You're gonna have to give that Xbox away to me as punishment damn. Well, here's the other thing

57:34.060 --> 57:36.980
I was gonna say question asker and I don't want to be sort of a doubt downer

57:37.220 --> 57:40.460
But maybe just cancel shipment cuz I ain't no game. Oh, yeah

57:41.220 --> 57:45.860
Damn, I use their it. I hate to bring it like this to be kind of Sony

57:45.860 --> 57:51.980
Oh, yeah, there's no games that Sony there's only we got them all

57:53.300 --> 57:55.100
Sony's got them all

57:55.100 --> 57:57.700
For Xbox. They're a they don't have crash

57:58.020 --> 58:05.500
No crash bamdakut on that one or gex is the term Sony crony cuz I've always used like I'm a bro for Sony and just

58:05.500 --> 58:07.500
Said like I'm a brony. Is that not?

58:07.900 --> 58:12.340
No, that's not the one you could be a Sony crony or a Sony Sony

58:12.340 --> 58:15.780
Uh, what's the one? Yo, is it Sony Pony? Oh

58:18.620 --> 58:24.420
See that's so weird. I've actually combined it when I said I'm a brony pony. Is that bad? No, that's good

58:25.140 --> 58:27.140
No, it's good. Okay. It's a good name

58:28.060 --> 58:34.460
This it just and I'm someone who loves Xbox. So I've also also I just said I'm a sex box. Yeah

58:35.060 --> 58:37.060

58:37.060 --> 58:40.980
Oh, man, I won the contest. Yes

58:42.340 --> 58:47.860
Maybe like I won that contest I entered. Okay, wait for Xbox. There is a way

58:48.420 --> 58:51.280
This is gonna sound manipulative. I just did it. Of course. There's a way

58:51.280 --> 58:54.780
I think you spend some time on this contest victory. It's good stuff

58:56.020 --> 59:00.600
There's just I'm just saying you want a contest. I did hands-on. I did hands-on a hard body win

59:00.600 --> 59:06.600
Um over overnight. Yeah, other people did a bad job

59:07.440 --> 59:12.120
I thought it would take way longer. I thought the other day when I was gone for 20 minutes

59:12.120 --> 59:15.800
That was it. It was a hands-on a hard body. It lasted 20 minutes

59:15.800 --> 59:23.240
They filled the fucking room with scorpions and you know me I think I think they're cute. I think they're neat. So easy Xbox
