WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:50.720
It's the most wonderful time of the year. Pretty sure that's exactly how you started

00:50.720 --> 00:55.120
it last year. Is it really? That's a tradition now. Now it's not me ripping off a bit for myself

00:55.120 --> 01:03.600
for a year ago. It's a tradition. It is the birthday episode, all three of us, November 8th,

01:03.600 --> 01:09.520
blowing it up with our big B-day. Happy birthday to all three of us. Travis, are you stoked about

01:09.520 --> 01:15.120
your B-day? I'm so stoked. What are you looking forward to the most? The presents, the gifts,

01:15.120 --> 01:19.440
the cheer? The chicken fried bacon. You're gonna get some chicken fried bacon for your birthday.

01:19.440 --> 01:24.400
I'm gonna get all the chicken fried bacon for my birthday. Is that a gift? It seems like,

01:24.400 --> 01:28.240
what's the opposite of what a gift is for your apartment and liver? It's a punishment. Now,

01:28.240 --> 01:34.960
Griffin, what is your big birthday plan? My big birthday plan is to put myself into a state of

01:34.960 --> 01:40.880
cryo sleep for six months until it is really my birthday. Okay, well, let's take a quick poll.

01:40.880 --> 01:44.640
I feel like everybody on the show's birthday is November 8th, so let me go around and we'll see

01:44.640 --> 01:51.920
if my birthday is November 8th. Yeah. Oh, my birthday is November 8th. My birthday is November

01:51.920 --> 01:58.640
8th. No, wait. No, it's not. Is it not? That does not ring true. It's April 17th.

01:59.840 --> 02:05.600
Wow, that sucks. It's so fucking far. I could not be fucking further away. And it sucks because I

02:05.600 --> 02:11.120
know the two of you were conceived on Valentine's Day. It just adds up. Don't do this to me. Don't

02:11.120 --> 02:16.080
do this to me. And when was I? Not on this day. What could I possibly have been? Fourth of July.

02:16.080 --> 02:21.760
I guess I could be. Those fireworks going off. It's pretty romantic. Stop it! I can't do this

02:21.760 --> 02:27.520
to you. You're killing me. I love you. Let's conceive. Two birthday presents now is what I

02:27.520 --> 02:33.760
need. I can't even handle this advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother,

02:33.760 --> 02:39.200
Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy. I'm your youngest brother.

02:39.200 --> 02:45.040
Most independent. Not celebrating. No birthday today. Most patriotic brother. My wife just

02:45.040 --> 02:49.760
brought me coffee. That's awesome. Oh, man. Yeah. Wait, your wife just brought me coffee?

02:50.400 --> 02:56.240
That's impossible. Holy shit. Time walker. It's a birthday miracle. It's a birthday miracle.

02:56.240 --> 03:02.160
My wife's a time walker. This is, of course, an advice show for the modern era. Let's dip right

03:02.160 --> 03:07.760
in to the help, to the advice. I feel like it's going to be a good show. We got a lot of exciting

03:07.760 --> 03:13.840
stuff today. We got guest stars, several guest stars. Is it their birthday? Did we even bother

03:13.840 --> 03:18.720
ask? It may or may not be their birthday. Let's assume it is. Let's assume it's all of their

03:18.720 --> 03:25.360
birthdays. We got a big, big live show announcement. We've got lots of people to help and so much more.

03:25.360 --> 03:34.640
Let's dip right in. My friends and I go weekly to a pub trivia night. About two months ago,

03:34.640 --> 03:39.120
two strangers asked to join our team. That was fine, but then they started showing up almost

03:39.120 --> 03:43.920
every week. This could have been okay, but they're both quite full of themselves. Talk over the other

03:43.920 --> 03:48.480
people. Don't let people provide questions to answers. They're sucking the joy out of our

03:48.480 --> 03:54.640
trivia experience. So, how do we get them off the team? And that is actually from Team Croco Swine.

03:56.880 --> 04:02.560
It's one of the oldest stories in the book. I think people who have spent years educating

04:02.560 --> 04:08.960
themselves on trivia, the one area in which minutia escapes them is in matters of the human heart.

04:09.600 --> 04:16.400
Which is why we're here. That is rarely a subject of a pub trivia night. Yeah, usually just go with

04:16.400 --> 04:27.920
Superior Vina Cava. That's usually what's up. I think I maybe have done like bar trivia like once.

04:27.920 --> 04:35.120
Yeah. Is this like a high stakes game? It gets pretty high fee. Yeah, it gets hot. It gets hot.

04:35.120 --> 04:43.200
I've been on two award-winning trivia teams. The Amazing Larry and the Robert C. Byrd Institute

04:43.200 --> 04:51.520
for Trivia. And both like real grand slam high stakes teams. And we got to the national

04:51.520 --> 04:58.320
championships, won a few grando. I mean, it gets hot. I was not on that national championship team.

04:58.320 --> 05:00.720
I just don't understand this heightened emotion where you can't just be like,

05:00.720 --> 05:03.920
hey, I think maybe it's just going to be me and my friends tonight.

05:05.600 --> 05:10.640
Friendship, honestly, can't factor into it because you need to build a streamlined

05:11.520 --> 05:19.040
minutia knowing machine. You need to put together an internet of people that know everything.

05:19.040 --> 05:22.880
Yeah. You need to build it. You need to make a human Google. And it's hard to do that when you

05:22.880 --> 05:28.400
let a bunch of randos in. Well, what if you just like wore a visor and carried around a clipboard

05:28.400 --> 05:33.440
and walked up to them and said, hey, you're cut. Yeah, you're out. I think that's an option. I

05:33.440 --> 05:39.440
think you could show everybody could show up as a new team next week. A reformed like, you know,

05:39.440 --> 05:44.080
when they, you know, when they reform a band with everybody except one guy, you're like,

05:44.080 --> 05:49.200
wait a minute. You were a member of Jefferson Airplane. Right. You're Jefferson Starship.

05:49.200 --> 05:55.040
We're Jefferson Trivia Starship. We are going a whole new direction. What am I thinking of?

05:55.040 --> 06:01.360
Who did that? It was a whole same band except for the one person there. I mean, I guess Van Halen

06:01.360 --> 06:08.960
is sort of like that, but they remain the same band. It'll come to me. I guess the Elvis Costello's

06:08.960 --> 06:14.080
imposters are sort of like that because they're the attractions and they cut Elvis Costello. They cut

06:14.080 --> 06:21.920
Elvis Costello out. Bad career. Now they just do Jefferson Airplane songs. That's a good that's a

06:21.920 --> 06:27.360
good option to make a new team. Also, if they're randos, just say to tell them to start their own

06:27.360 --> 06:31.680
goddamn team. Yeah. Like, hey, I don't fucking know you. I don't know. You're not. Please stop.

06:31.680 --> 06:39.200
You're not my buddy. Yeah. We're not bros. Wait, could you do like a surgical like skip three

06:39.200 --> 06:46.240
nights? Yeah. See that. I usually do that whenever, uh, like I used to do karaoke at this one place.

06:46.240 --> 06:51.120
I had some clingers, you know, people liked my star power. Right. Said you have a star quality

06:51.120 --> 06:55.760
and I'm attracted to that. I want to be near you. I want to be near eventually. I want to be near

06:55.760 --> 06:59.680
and around you and eventually had to stop coming for a little bit and give them time to cool,

06:59.680 --> 07:05.600
cool their jets, you know, ice their heels, let them orbit around another star for a few. Yeah.

07:05.600 --> 07:12.320
See how that works out. And, uh, and, and after a few weeks I came back cleansed cleanse, but they

07:12.320 --> 07:15.600
were still, I was doing them. I was doing the master cleanse. Weren't they? That's important

07:15.600 --> 07:20.560
to the stage. The stage door Johnny's waiting. We're doing the all juice karaoke diet. Nothing

07:20.560 --> 07:27.760
but ginger water. And, um, I was saying so good after work. No toxins, no toxins in this body.

07:27.760 --> 07:32.720
That's a, that's a good remedy. That's a good home remedy tip. What about just sitting in a

07:32.720 --> 07:41.120
smaller table? Why don't you go fucking solo? That's a power play. What? That's a, that's like,

07:41.120 --> 07:46.560
that's like going solo in euchre. It's like, you gotta, you gotta have the faith in yourself

07:46.560 --> 07:51.440
to achieve your dreams. If you do, if you do do it though, please refer to yourself

07:51.440 --> 08:00.160
as Crom door of the all knowing me. No, no, no. I'm a member of team Jeff. What's your team name?

08:00.160 --> 08:06.000
Dave. That is, that's just, that's my name is Dave. I think you didn't tell him to stop. I mean, like

08:06.960 --> 08:11.440
America, we gotta get better at telling randos where to get off. These are randos and their

08:11.440 --> 08:17.120
stop is this week. You tell them, listen guys, uh, this is kind of a French thing that we did

08:17.120 --> 08:23.120
with friends and we, we need you to go. You can go right there. There's the door. Here's the thing

08:23.120 --> 08:27.360
there. I can't think of any repercussions that could happen. It's not like you're going to kick

08:27.360 --> 08:32.800
them off the team and they're going to like slit your tires or something better team. See, that's

08:32.800 --> 08:37.840
all I can think is that they come back at you as like the, you know, river bottom nightmare band

08:37.840 --> 08:43.520
and they take you out. I can't, I think you have to be very clear if they're the weak links in your

08:43.520 --> 08:48.880
team. That's the more important thing. And maybe if you have some sort of, wait a minute, what if

08:48.880 --> 08:55.600
you have some sort of trivia showdown? You say the team's too crowded. We need to winnow it down to

08:55.600 --> 09:00.640
the essentials. And then you have a series of questions that only relate to things that you and

09:00.640 --> 09:08.640
your friends remember at Steve's birthday party last year. What kind of cake did we have? Darla,

09:08.640 --> 09:17.840
who did you blow and never tell anyone about it? It's me. Sorry, Jeff. Sorry, Randy. You're off the

09:17.840 --> 09:28.400
team assholes. This, this situation seems to happen a lot more, more than just one than just team

09:28.400 --> 09:33.440
trivia occasions. Like I have, it happens a lot and it sucks every time it does. Like if you're

09:33.440 --> 09:36.960
at a concert and there's somebody there who doesn't know anybody. So there's like, Hey,

09:36.960 --> 09:42.480
can I hang out with your group? And you're like, you can't say no, but at the same time, I guess,

09:42.480 --> 09:47.600
I guess different question though, if it's one person, because I feel like one person,

09:47.600 --> 09:51.280
that's just sort of like a nice thing you're doing. These guys are a unit, you know, like

09:51.280 --> 09:57.520
they're two dudes. Just tell them to go, tell them it's time to go. I think, I think that

09:57.520 --> 10:01.520
the problem is if they had been like, can I join your team? And then they would have been awesome

10:01.520 --> 10:05.760
and like buying drinks for everybody and super cool and getting all the questions right. No problem

10:05.760 --> 10:10.800
whatsoever, but they failed the audition. They suck at this. Like they're not getting the questions

10:10.800 --> 10:15.120
right. They talk over people. Like I think that you're perfectly within your rights to be like,

10:15.120 --> 10:19.360
Hey, we let you onto our team. We tried it out and it's just not working out. Thanks.

10:19.360 --> 10:25.360
Can I, can I talk about it? A serious character deficit that this country is experiencing right

10:25.360 --> 10:33.040
now. It seems like, and I don't know if I've ever had this kind of friend, but it seems like

10:33.040 --> 10:41.200
the pushy, sort of bossy, sassy friend is gone. It's no longer exists. He's like the bee. He's

10:41.200 --> 10:46.080
like the modern bee. He's gone. He's just vanished from the earth. You need a pushy bossy friend that

10:46.080 --> 10:52.720
can be like, nope, everybody needs a Vince Vaughn. Everyone does need a Vince Vaughn. And it just

10:52.720 --> 10:56.720
seems like that that's a, that person no longer exists. And I don't know why. Do you think it's

10:56.720 --> 11:01.920
because of the internet? I think it's because of like PC movements and everybody trying to

11:01.920 --> 11:06.880
be very delicate and careful about everyone's feelings and all that stuff. See, I'm that,

11:06.880 --> 11:11.280
I'm that though. Am I part of the problem? I don't think I can, I can experience a sea change like

11:11.280 --> 11:16.640
that. Or all of a sudden I can walk into a bar and be like, I don't like this. You know? Here's

11:16.640 --> 11:22.800
what it is. The Vince Vaughn friend is a friend that it's, it's, it's difficult to keep them around

11:22.800 --> 11:27.280
all the time because that's the friend that you end up saying like, well, if you knew him, he's a

11:27.280 --> 11:32.400
great guy. You just don't know him like I know him. You're right. Right. And I think everybody

11:32.400 --> 11:38.000
does have that friend, but it's harder to keep that friend as time goes on. I'm saying if you're

11:38.000 --> 11:41.920
young and you're still trying to figure out who you are in this world, I think maybe put your chips

11:41.920 --> 11:48.880
down on Sass. Double down on Sass. Double down. But not everyone can do it. I, I've known some

11:48.880 --> 11:54.160
people who are just assholes, but then there's the really likable asshole and that if you can't pull

11:54.160 --> 11:58.400
off likable asshole, you really got out of the game. You got to thread that needle. But listen,

11:58.400 --> 12:05.840
like if you don't want these people on your trivia team, they have failed. Like that's the most sort

12:05.840 --> 12:10.240
of regimented social interaction you could possibly have. There's a designated start time,

12:10.240 --> 12:14.400
a designated stop time. If you don't want these guys on your trivia team, you don't want them in

12:14.400 --> 12:18.640
your life. Fuck them. You don't even know them. They're strangers. It's not like there's a history.

12:18.640 --> 12:23.120
You're not going to ruin your friendship with them. Guys, what if they're strong?

12:23.120 --> 12:28.320
What if they're strong? What if they're grownups? Oh, they're big kids. You're saying like physically

12:28.320 --> 12:32.800
imposing. I mean, if they're big and strong, you can't tell, you can't tell a big, strong

12:32.800 --> 12:37.840
grownup where to get off. Yeah. Right. Didn't think about that. An older boy said you were on

12:37.840 --> 12:43.360
my trivia team now. So I guess you are. Yeah. I talked to my dad. He said, I'm on it. So handle,

12:43.360 --> 12:50.880
handle that. Hey guys, is this, is it acceptable when you have a back itch to scratch it on various

12:50.880 --> 12:58.400
public services, like the corner of a wall or a shelf of some kind itchy in Indiana? Well,

12:58.400 --> 13:06.080
Baloo the bear. Um, it sounds like you're in a tailspin. Let's pull out of it. Let's just boil

13:06.080 --> 13:16.000
this down to the bear necessities. Oh God. Um, crap. This is, this is use your hand. Get your

13:16.000 --> 13:21.760
hand back there or a friend's hand. It doesn't work. I re I reach for Richard. He's bear scratch.

13:21.760 --> 13:28.000
When I'm in this situation, you may remember him. He's, he was balloon boy's dad, a real nut job,

13:28.000 --> 13:34.560
but he has a device that he will sell you on the internet 30 for two. Uh, you can find this

13:34.560 --> 13:42.160
at bear scratch.com. And, uh, it is the, the tagline is if you itch like a son of a Twitch.

13:42.160 --> 13:48.240
Oh God. You need the patent pending bear scratch. It is basically a piece of wood that you tie to

13:48.240 --> 13:59.040
your wall. It's basically what's up. If, if your son is a guy that you shoot into the sky balloon

13:59.040 --> 14:07.040
boy jokes. I believe it is not acceptable, but it does feel so damn good. I do it all the time.

14:07.040 --> 14:14.080
Sure. What do you say when you're caught in the act? What are you doing to that shelf? Travis?

14:14.960 --> 14:20.800
I say, um, don't judge my love. Okay. Don't you? You don't know me. You don't know this wood.

14:22.640 --> 14:30.320
Uh, he started it. He just blamed the wood. He itched. He was scratching on me on the wall on

14:30.320 --> 14:37.920
retropenis bear scratch. Can you not just wear like a wool sweater and then just shimmy around

14:37.920 --> 14:42.560
and it scratches all of you at once. What can you not reach? How big a boy are you?

14:42.560 --> 14:45.920
That's what I'm saying. What if you just started screaming? There's ants in my clothes.

14:45.920 --> 14:51.280
Okay. Who's going to judge you then? Well, it was an emergency yet. Every person. Why is it,

14:51.280 --> 14:56.320
why are your clothes so sticky? Sweet. Why, why is it preferable Travis? Like why is it

14:56.320 --> 15:00.400
preferable to think for people to think of you as the guy with bugs in his clothes? Yeah. You

15:00.400 --> 15:05.920
can stealthily scratch yourself on a shelf, but if you yell, oh, let me throw this out.

15:06.960 --> 15:11.120
The awkward part of scratching your back on an object is like you get into it and you close

15:11.120 --> 15:13.920
your eyes and then you open your eyes and realize people are staring at you. Right?

15:14.480 --> 15:18.160
What if you just kept your eyes open the whole time and stared right back at him while you did

15:18.160 --> 15:23.920
it? It turns out this gets into a weird erotic territory. Watch me do this. Watch me do this.

15:23.920 --> 15:32.640
This is the weirdest scene in Basic Instinct. Can we invent like a fun dance that you do

15:32.640 --> 15:37.200
when you need to itch yourself and then people will be like, oh, he's doing the itchy jiggle.

15:37.200 --> 15:40.800
Well, the bear scratch dance is actually available on iTunes if you want to grab that.

15:40.800 --> 15:43.120
Do the bear scratch. Do the bear scratch dance.

15:44.240 --> 15:51.440
I have a, one wall of my apartment is sort of just covered in stone outcroppings and let me

15:51.440 --> 15:57.200
tell you, it's like, it's like God's fingernails. You just get right up against that and no, you,

15:57.200 --> 15:59.680
I have never, I haven't itched since I lived here.

16:00.480 --> 16:01.760
Wow. That's a good record.

16:02.400 --> 16:03.280
It's pretty great.

16:03.280 --> 16:05.200
It's a good streak. You got to keep that going.

16:05.200 --> 16:06.640
It's like a loofah made of stone.

16:07.600 --> 16:09.920
I wouldn't leave my house because I'd be too worried that like,

16:09.920 --> 16:12.880
what if you get out in public and your back starts itching and the streak is broken.

16:12.880 --> 16:14.880
Yeah. I gotta, I gotta go home you guys.

16:14.880 --> 16:21.440
Guinness. It's me. It's Griffin. It's over. Shut it down. I tried my best. Didn't work out.

16:21.440 --> 16:22.720
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

16:22.720 --> 16:23.520
Yeah, that'd be great.

16:24.960 --> 16:29.120
This one was sent in by Jacob Locker. Thank you by Jake. Thank you by, thank you by Jacob.

16:31.200 --> 16:31.840
You're welcome.

16:33.040 --> 16:37.760
It's by Yahoo Answers user Jess who asks, what is the stripper etiquette for Canada?

16:37.760 --> 16:44.960
Okay. This is a random thought. I have no intention of going to a strip club,

16:44.960 --> 16:48.000
even though I am legal. FYI. It's just, this is bugging me.

16:48.560 --> 16:50.960
First off, you're totally thinking about going to a strip club, but yeah.

16:51.760 --> 16:55.760
You know how in movies they toss strippers dollar bills? Well, in Canada,

16:55.760 --> 17:00.240
we have loonies and toonies. So do you like toss coins at the person?

17:01.200 --> 17:01.840
Oh God.

17:02.720 --> 17:06.880
Or are Canadian strippers more costly than Americans just because of our bill system?

17:06.880 --> 17:12.400
In Canada, is the minimum bill tossing rule is $5 since that's our smallest bill.

17:12.400 --> 17:15.760
I'm honestly not trying to be rude. So if it offends anyone, I really mean no harm.

17:16.800 --> 17:21.440
I want you to know Griffin that after, what is this? Episode 79, 79 episodes,

17:21.440 --> 17:26.080
you finally asked a Yahoo Answers question that made me go, wait, that's a good question.

17:26.080 --> 17:27.360
Yeah. Is it?

17:28.160 --> 17:30.560
Do you just throw the coins at them? That seems rude.

17:30.560 --> 17:36.640
Hey, whatever happened, excuse me, whatever happened to Galaxia who used to dance here?

17:36.640 --> 17:39.520
Yeah, that was real sad, eh? She got a loonie in her poonie.

17:42.720 --> 17:44.880
It was a real sad situation that one, eh?

17:46.320 --> 17:49.920
So a loonie, I just Googled is a Canadian $1 coin.

17:51.920 --> 17:58.400
First of all, I would like to point out that I believe that this person has never been to

17:59.520 --> 18:02.400
a strip club because no strip club I've ever been to

18:03.120 --> 18:05.920
incorporate to just throwing money at the stripper.

18:05.920 --> 18:06.720
Take these.

18:06.720 --> 18:10.240
Like wadding up the bill and trying to hit her in the face with it. That's not how that works.

18:11.040 --> 18:14.400
I have to disagree with you here, Travis. I actually saw a stripper who was, I believe,

18:14.400 --> 18:21.600
a little person. If not, she was quite short, put a cup in front of her zone down there.

18:21.600 --> 18:23.200
Uh-huh, her zone.

18:23.200 --> 18:30.240
Her sin spot. She put a cup in front of her zone and people took turns throwing

18:31.680 --> 18:33.680
dollar bills in there and if they-

18:33.680 --> 18:36.160
That's the worst bozo show game I've ever had.

18:36.160 --> 18:40.240
If they sunk a shot, then they got, well, it's unspeakable what happened to them.

18:43.280 --> 18:44.240
Oh, Jesus.

18:44.240 --> 18:49.280
It sounds like he was not there, Travis. I'm sorry. Not there that night.

18:49.920 --> 18:53.760
So the Canadian version, it sounds like whenever you go to like a Taco Bell and they have that

18:53.760 --> 18:56.640
little thing where you drop the quarter in and you try to land it on the plates.

18:56.640 --> 18:59.360
And if you do, you get like a crunch, a crunch wrap.

18:59.360 --> 19:04.160
But instead of that, you try to throw a loonie on an old lady's bosom.

19:04.160 --> 19:07.040
I understand now why every time I've gone to a Canadian strip club,

19:07.040 --> 19:10.960
they have those little bus driver change things on their belts.

19:10.960 --> 19:13.520
And you give them a $5 bill and you're like, I need three back.

19:13.520 --> 19:16.640
And they're like, okay, kachunk, kachunk, kachunk. And they hand you three coins.

19:16.640 --> 19:17.600
I get it now.

19:17.600 --> 19:20.000
That's a very erotic exchange.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.200
So erotic.

19:21.200 --> 19:25.360
Yeah. And it's nice because you can get Snickers to strike the machines right there.

19:26.240 --> 19:27.120
They hate that, though.

19:27.120 --> 19:31.040
Canada, your money, your money is really weird, Canada.

19:31.040 --> 19:33.040
You have things called loonies and toonies.

19:33.040 --> 19:38.320
But this is the thing. I'm so on this tip, though, because every other country besides us,

19:39.520 --> 19:43.920
like their $1 bill, they realize it's not worth anything and you can buy nothing with it.

19:43.920 --> 19:45.760
So there's just a coin.

19:47.440 --> 19:51.680
In England, they have coins that are worth four of our dollars. It's ridiculous.

19:51.680 --> 19:57.280
Well, I love that every time we do it, every time America tries to do a dollar quarter or a dollar

19:57.280 --> 20:02.080
coin, it's such bullshit. And everyone's like, what is this? Never mind.

20:02.080 --> 20:07.840
And like the only time you ever need them is if you pay like a parking garage or when you go to

20:07.840 --> 20:11.440
the bank and they give you like a stock at your way, a coin, you're like, ah, damn it.

20:11.440 --> 20:13.680
And then it sits in a drawer forever and ever and ever.

20:13.680 --> 20:17.760
Yeah, because you can never find it's like it's enough of a big deal to find a machine that uses

20:17.760 --> 20:23.600
it, like it advertises it like you can use a dollar coin here. Except at theme parks,

20:23.600 --> 20:27.040
amusement parks. They are crazy about the Sacajawea dollar coin.

20:27.040 --> 20:32.320
For some reason, the only time the only way to get like a locker is to turn your money into

20:32.320 --> 20:36.800
Sacajawea coins and then put them in the locker. It's like, why don't you just take dollars?

20:36.800 --> 20:45.600
I this is all very funny. I think it's dangerous to throw coins at a lady.

20:45.600 --> 20:48.480
Can we agree with that?

20:48.480 --> 20:51.840
I mean, like what other circumstance would that be okay in?

20:51.840 --> 20:54.320
I'm looking at these loonies and these toonies and they look like

20:54.960 --> 20:59.760
some heavy alloy. So you got to throw a fiver. And if that's the case,

21:01.360 --> 21:04.640
Canadian strippers must be like balling.

21:04.640 --> 21:08.640
Oh yeah, like Scarface. Totally, totally rich.

21:09.200 --> 21:12.800
Well, the trick is you have to form it into a paper airplane and they have to catch it out

21:12.800 --> 21:17.040
of the air or else they don't get to keep it. They can't use their hands, which I think is

21:17.040 --> 21:25.600
awful what you just said. Is it possible that you only throw it a fifth as frequently as Americans

21:25.600 --> 21:28.720
do? Are we talking about lump sums?

21:28.720 --> 21:34.080
Okay, so you're saying like, it's five dollars, but the standards of performance are much higher?

21:34.080 --> 21:39.440
The standard of performance, and instead of throwing like a buckaroo every five minutes or

21:39.440 --> 21:45.760
so to get a look, a look-see, you throw a fiver every half an hour and then you just get the

21:45.760 --> 21:47.280
whole kit and caboodle.

21:47.280 --> 21:49.440
Lump sums for some lumps, it seems.

21:53.440 --> 22:01.840
Maybe our Canadian erotic, exotic dancers are working it five times as hard.

22:01.840 --> 22:02.240
That's what I'm saying.

22:02.240 --> 22:04.640
Maybe they are getting, yeah.

22:04.640 --> 22:11.360
Maybe it's like, hey Darla, you look like an American up there. You work five times more than

22:11.360 --> 22:13.600
that. Shake it down. Get that stuff everywhere.

22:13.600 --> 22:19.440
What I would like to imagine is they've just done away with like the slow, sexy takes five

22:19.440 --> 22:21.920
minutes and they've just like pumped it up and it's like house techno beats.

22:21.920 --> 22:23.680
Oh, they put on some dubstep and they just fucking stop to it.

22:23.680 --> 22:27.600
And they are fucking sweating their asses off the whole time and it's a challenge. It's like,

22:27.600 --> 22:30.640
do you want this five dollars? You're gonna have to work it.

22:30.640 --> 22:35.280
Are you crumping right now? Is that Zumba?

22:35.280 --> 22:37.760
Let's, let's move on to another, to another question.

22:38.960 --> 22:42.720
Although I would actually, we've never asked this.

22:43.760 --> 22:48.800
If you do have some actual insight to that question, I would genuinely-

22:48.800 --> 22:50.720
Right, you kind of want to know now.

22:50.720 --> 22:53.520
Yeah, I kind of would like, I am kind of curious about it.

22:54.080 --> 22:58.400
I'm gonna say, I'm gonna say, no, I think instead of being inquisitive, we need to be

22:58.400 --> 23:01.920
instructive and I'm going to go ahead and say, blanket statement.

23:01.920 --> 23:03.920
Don't throw a coin at a lady.

23:03.920 --> 23:04.160
Right.

23:04.960 --> 23:05.520
Don't throw a coin.

23:05.520 --> 23:07.520
You slide it across the floor to her.

23:07.520 --> 23:11.200
Yeah, you can, you can slide her a little, a tiny bag.

23:11.200 --> 23:13.360
Oh, you flip it like you're an old style gangster.

23:14.000 --> 23:15.040
Here's a dollar, chick.

23:15.840 --> 23:16.960
Let me get a pape.

23:16.960 --> 23:19.040
Like, oh, I can't. I don't have a pape.

23:19.680 --> 23:20.720
I've got a pasty.

23:21.920 --> 23:28.320
Hey, when does a 17 year old male get his female friend of the same age for a birthday

23:28.320 --> 23:29.040
gift?

23:29.040 --> 23:33.840
I haven't been to a girl's birthday party outside of family and I'm confused as to what

23:33.840 --> 23:35.040
I should get her for a gift.

23:35.600 --> 23:40.400
If I should even get her one at all, that's from vexed in Vancouver.

23:40.400 --> 23:41.440
Yikes.

23:41.440 --> 23:43.200
That's a tough one, right?

23:43.200 --> 23:43.760
Yeah.

23:43.760 --> 23:44.320
I mean like-

23:44.320 --> 23:44.880
I say-

23:44.880 --> 23:46.480
He's going into hostile territory.

23:48.000 --> 23:51.600
You get her a gift card to Brookstone worth like 15 loonies.

23:51.600 --> 24:01.760
I think the safest way to go and what I would recommend is get her like a movie or book

24:01.760 --> 24:07.760
or something that you like and you can say, you know, I like this book and I thought you

24:07.760 --> 24:08.960
would too.

24:08.960 --> 24:12.880
Well, I'm just saying like, if you don't know what to get her, don't try to get something

24:12.880 --> 24:13.840
huge and elaborate.

24:13.840 --> 24:17.280
Just say like, you know, this was a really good movie and I thought you'd like it.

24:19.120 --> 24:19.600
No?

24:19.600 --> 24:22.640
I got you Sky Captain in the World of Tomorrow on DVD.

24:22.640 --> 24:23.600
I really like it.

24:23.600 --> 24:26.080
By the way, can I borrow that when you're done with it?

24:26.080 --> 24:27.200
Happy birthday.

24:27.200 --> 24:29.840
You don't have to tell her you got it because you liked it.

24:29.840 --> 24:32.240
I'm saying like, I thought you would like this movie.

24:32.240 --> 24:36.000
She's not going to throw it back in your face and be like, bullshit, I don't like this movie.

24:36.000 --> 24:36.720
You're wrong.

24:36.720 --> 24:39.280
I think that- but see, here's the thing though.

24:39.280 --> 24:42.800
When you're at a girl's birthday party, what if you're the only person who got her something

24:42.800 --> 24:43.280
like that?

24:43.840 --> 24:44.720
You don't know.

24:44.720 --> 24:47.360
I have no idea what girls get each other for birthdays.

24:47.360 --> 24:50.320
I could not- especially when I was 17, I couldn't-

24:50.320 --> 24:52.400
What is the cutoff?

24:52.400 --> 24:52.640
What?

24:53.840 --> 24:57.680
At what age do presents stop being mandatory every year?

24:59.360 --> 25:03.200
No, you do need to bring a present because that's a fate worse than death if you bring-

25:03.200 --> 25:04.560
you're the only one without one.

25:05.120 --> 25:12.160
I just feel like something that everybody- is there a gift that you could name where

25:13.200 --> 25:14.640
you always need another one?

25:14.640 --> 25:18.320
And if we could just pick that one gift that you could always get anybody and it's always

25:18.320 --> 25:20.800
appreciated, what do you always appreciate when you get?

25:21.680 --> 25:25.600
For me, it's those tins of butter cookies, you know, the blue ones.

25:25.600 --> 25:26.880
I love those, man.

25:26.880 --> 25:28.480
Give me as many of those as you got.

25:29.040 --> 25:31.280
A fancy food item or something potable.

25:32.240 --> 25:35.520
Either way, you can't lose because everybody eats and everybody likes to get drunk.

25:35.520 --> 25:40.240
Yeah, especially if it's something like kind of special, not just like I got you a bag

25:40.240 --> 25:44.080
of M&Ms, but like I got you this box of chocolate covered potato chips.

25:44.080 --> 25:44.880
Okay, that's fun.

25:44.880 --> 25:45.520
It's interesting.

25:45.520 --> 25:46.240
It's different.

25:46.240 --> 25:47.440
It's a girl, though.

25:47.440 --> 25:49.520
What if she's like trying to get fit or something?

25:49.520 --> 25:51.120
Yeah, what if she's like, are you saying I'm fat?

25:51.120 --> 25:53.440
Then you get her fitness bars, Justin.

25:53.440 --> 25:54.320
There's fit food.

25:55.280 --> 25:56.240
He doesn't know though.

25:56.240 --> 25:57.520
This is what I'm saying.

25:57.520 --> 25:58.720
How could he guess what's-

25:58.720 --> 26:01.200
Oh no, because if you get fitness bars, you're saying she's fat.

26:01.200 --> 26:01.760
I had to-

26:01.760 --> 26:02.800
You're straight up saying she's fat.

26:02.800 --> 26:07.840
I have to talk to my wife each morning for a good 20 minutes before I have any idea who

26:07.840 --> 26:08.320
she is.

26:08.320 --> 26:11.120
Like I don't know what's on her mind that day.

26:11.120 --> 26:12.320
I don't know what she's thinking about.

26:12.320 --> 26:12.880
I don't know.

26:12.880 --> 26:14.720
It takes me a while to get acclimated.

26:14.720 --> 26:18.080
Do you think he's just going to walk into a birthday party with something?

26:18.080 --> 26:20.240
Here's an item and it is appropriate.

26:20.240 --> 26:23.920
Like I don't think he can, I don't see what he's going to choose.

26:23.920 --> 26:24.720
Oh, I've got it.

26:26.000 --> 26:27.120
A dream catcher.

26:27.120 --> 26:28.080
Oh, that's good.

26:28.080 --> 26:28.800
That's good.

26:29.600 --> 26:35.680
I think the problem here is that you are assuming, and I can say that you're assuming this because

26:35.680 --> 26:41.120
of your email, that you think there's one present that's good for girls because the

26:41.120 --> 26:46.640
information that you have provided us about this girl is that she is a girl and that's

26:46.640 --> 26:47.520
all we know.

26:47.520 --> 26:49.600
Like I need a gift suggestion.

26:49.600 --> 26:50.560
Here's what I know.

26:51.360 --> 26:55.200
She's a lady, period.

26:55.200 --> 27:00.640
Well, let's see, yeah, I mean-

27:00.640 --> 27:02.160
Soap, I don't know.

27:02.160 --> 27:05.280
But that's as much as I knew about girls when I was 17.

27:05.280 --> 27:07.520
I didn't even know how they got their hair to smell so good.

27:07.520 --> 27:10.320
Like what am I going to get them that they don't already have?

27:10.320 --> 27:13.040
And then you learned that they just put honey in it every day.

27:13.840 --> 27:18.240
Is it possible that we could get a gift certificate?

27:18.240 --> 27:20.080
Is that a good present?

27:20.080 --> 27:22.080
I don't like gift certificates.

27:22.080 --> 27:22.640
Never?

27:22.640 --> 27:23.920
Never a good present?

27:24.880 --> 27:30.320
Well, they can be if the person says, I would love a gift certificate to blank.

27:30.320 --> 27:35.040
But just doing it voluntarily always strikes me like I couldn't think of anything to get

27:35.040 --> 27:37.040
you so I just got you fake money.

27:37.040 --> 27:39.120
Rarely do people give you that opportunity.

27:39.120 --> 27:42.640
Though, like nobody's ever like, man, I haven't been to Applebee's in a while.

27:42.640 --> 27:44.640
I would love to crush some tiny desserts.

27:45.840 --> 27:51.760
I feel like the presents I always liked the best are the ones that I secretly would kind

27:51.760 --> 27:54.960
of like, but would never buy for myself.

27:54.960 --> 28:01.200
Like my dear friend, Jason, for my last birthday, got me an RC car.

28:02.000 --> 28:03.280
Yeah, I'll take it.

28:03.280 --> 28:04.320
Thank you.

28:04.320 --> 28:05.360
I do want this.

28:05.360 --> 28:07.520
How did you know that I wanted this but would not buy this?

28:07.520 --> 28:09.840
I wanted this but would not buy this, but I do want this.

28:09.840 --> 28:16.960
So you're saying, you're saying easy solution is you get her the gift that even she doesn't

28:16.960 --> 28:19.120
know that she wants, but she wants it.

28:19.120 --> 28:20.320
Good suggestion, Justin.

28:20.320 --> 28:22.080
He's going to have a real easy time.

28:22.080 --> 28:27.040
You're saying that even with even with fucking psychic powers, he couldn't divine what this

28:27.040 --> 28:29.440
gift is that she wants that she doesn't know she wants.

28:29.440 --> 28:30.640
Yeah, that's great.

28:30.640 --> 28:32.400
Just get her that thing, duh.

28:32.400 --> 28:34.880
Maybe like a gap gift certificate would be good.

28:34.880 --> 28:36.240
Maybe like a Snuggie.

28:36.240 --> 28:37.680
Everybody wants one of those, right?

28:38.560 --> 28:39.680
Does she have a Snuggie?

28:40.640 --> 28:43.440
Get her a slap chop and just fucking hope for the best.

28:43.440 --> 28:44.320
Get her a slap chop.

28:45.360 --> 28:47.840
Get her a fucking slap chop and then don't go to her party.

28:47.840 --> 28:49.440
Because if she hates it, you'll never know.

28:49.440 --> 28:53.200
Can I tell you something right now, vexed, vexed in Vancouver?

28:53.200 --> 28:55.440
This is the end of your relationship with this girl.

28:55.440 --> 28:56.800
Oh, yeah, it's over.

28:56.800 --> 28:57.440
I'm sorry.

28:57.440 --> 28:58.960
It doesn't matter what you do.

28:58.960 --> 29:02.480
There is literally no there is no right thing for you to do here.

29:02.480 --> 29:04.560
We've we've so just embrace it.

29:04.560 --> 29:06.240
Just lean into it.

29:06.240 --> 29:09.600
Just put something in the card like just give her a note that says I hate you.

29:09.600 --> 29:10.080
Happy birthday.

29:10.080 --> 29:11.280
I got you some toonies.

29:12.800 --> 29:16.160
I got you some I got you some Canadian stripper battle armor.

29:16.160 --> 29:17.920
So when people launch toonies at you,

29:19.680 --> 29:20.720
I got you a shield.

29:20.720 --> 29:22.640
I got you a stripper shield.

29:22.640 --> 29:25.040
It's got ballistics, but sexy ballistics.

29:25.040 --> 29:29.280
Yeah, it's Kevlar, but with booby holes cut out of it.

29:29.920 --> 29:31.200
It's very hot.

29:31.200 --> 29:31.920
Enjoy now.

29:31.920 --> 29:33.520
And yeah, it's listen.

29:33.520 --> 29:34.960
You guys have had some laughs together.

29:35.680 --> 29:36.960
It's over now.

29:36.960 --> 29:37.440
Sorry.

29:37.440 --> 29:40.960
And you'll always look back and remember how great that friendship was.

29:40.960 --> 29:41.440
Used to be.

29:42.160 --> 29:43.440
You can't go to the party.

29:43.440 --> 29:45.360
That's the only that's your only option.

29:45.360 --> 29:45.920
You can't go.

29:46.560 --> 29:52.960
Insummation, body armor, a paid vacation at Applebee's or her secret heart's desire.

29:55.040 --> 29:56.080
Even she does not know.

29:56.080 --> 29:58.320
Even she does not know is her heart's desire.

29:58.320 --> 29:58.720
Yeah.

29:58.720 --> 30:00.160
So just get one of those.

30:00.160 --> 30:01.760
I would recommend the last one.

30:01.760 --> 30:03.040
I think that would be a big hit, but.

30:03.920 --> 30:05.280
Do you guys want to Yahoo?

30:05.280 --> 30:05.520
Yeah.

30:07.120 --> 30:11.360
This one was sent in by Krista Whalen.

30:11.360 --> 30:12.160
Thank you, Krista.

30:13.040 --> 30:15.360
It's by Yahoo and it's just user Cuckoo who asks.

30:16.640 --> 30:17.360
It's kind of gross.

30:18.640 --> 30:19.440
I'm sorry.

30:19.440 --> 30:22.080
OMG, my tropical fish are eating it.

30:23.440 --> 30:23.840
What?

30:27.200 --> 30:27.920
I'm so sorry.

30:27.920 --> 30:30.960
Someone just into my aquarium and now my fish are feeding on it.

30:30.960 --> 30:38.000
Don't let me finish.

30:38.000 --> 30:39.200
Will they get pregnant?

30:39.200 --> 30:40.560
And what kind of fish can I expect?

30:41.680 --> 30:43.600
Will they hatch out like tiny mermaid things?

30:48.560 --> 30:51.120
What kind of mystery is this?

30:51.120 --> 30:51.360
Yeah.

30:51.360 --> 30:52.800
Let's sleuth this one out.

30:55.680 --> 30:56.240
You know what?

30:56.240 --> 30:58.160
Not to get a girl for a birthday party.

30:58.160 --> 30:58.720
Yeah.

30:58.720 --> 31:00.240
Jizzing in her aquarium.

31:00.240 --> 31:01.280
Hey, look what I did.

31:02.160 --> 31:03.040
Happy birthday.

31:05.680 --> 31:07.360
That beta has human feet.

31:09.680 --> 31:10.640
Who jizzed in this?

31:11.600 --> 31:13.840
My beta has a human face like Seaman.

31:13.840 --> 31:18.800
I want to make an open appeal to the gentleman who committed this heinous crime.

31:18.800 --> 31:20.400
Why was that your best option?

31:21.040 --> 31:26.080
And what was the timeline like where someone jizzed in this aquarium, skedaddled,

31:26.080 --> 31:30.160
and she entered the room fast enough to see the fish eating the juice?

31:32.240 --> 31:34.640
Officially anything you put into an aquarium instantly.

31:34.640 --> 31:37.440
So it had to be like, done out.

31:37.440 --> 31:39.360
Hey, they're eating it.

31:39.360 --> 31:39.680
Yahoo.

31:42.560 --> 31:45.600
I passed a mysterious stranger coming out of my room.

31:46.560 --> 31:50.480
People say that the American Pie movies aren't having a detriment on our society.

31:50.480 --> 31:54.320
But look, teenagers out there are reenacting these scenes.

31:54.320 --> 31:56.160
And I did you guys see that one?

31:56.160 --> 31:56.960
I think it was Banking 3.

31:56.960 --> 32:00.880
Oh, the one where Stiffler ejaculates?

32:00.880 --> 32:03.440
No, well, it's actually it's a popular misconception.

32:03.440 --> 32:05.920
It's actually Stiffler's cousin at that point.

32:05.920 --> 32:12.400
So Stiffler's cousin gives his seed, the gift of his seed, to an aquarium.

32:12.400 --> 32:12.640
Yeah.

32:12.640 --> 32:16.640
And then fish eat it, and then it creates horrible sea monsters.

32:16.640 --> 32:21.840
I am so upset, like physically angry at all of this.

32:21.840 --> 32:23.840
Yeah, there's nothing good about this.

32:23.840 --> 32:25.520
Think about fish with human arms.

32:25.520 --> 32:26.640
No, you know what, Griffin?

32:26.640 --> 32:28.560
And you think about how you'll never be able to hang out with it.

32:29.520 --> 32:36.880
I'm eight steps back thinking about the prior situation before this girl walked into the room.

32:36.880 --> 32:40.480
Was this gentleman standing there and he pulled out a chair and stood on top of it?

32:40.480 --> 32:43.120
No, no, no, I'm sure it's not that big.

32:43.120 --> 32:49.360
The problem is that maybe you're just assuming that this person started out

32:49.360 --> 32:54.320
with the intention of, oh, I'm going to jerk it in this here fish tank.

32:55.760 --> 32:57.680
I think that it was an emergency.

32:57.680 --> 32:59.440
I think he was short on time.

32:59.440 --> 32:59.680
Right.

32:59.680 --> 33:02.880
I think he said, I need to do this somewhere.

33:04.240 --> 33:07.520
So you're saying he just didn't have an exit strategy when he started.

33:07.520 --> 33:11.360
His plan was jerk it, and then that was it.

33:11.360 --> 33:12.320
That's the end of the plan.

33:12.320 --> 33:17.200
It's honestly her fault for hanging that poster of Carla Gugino behind her aquarium.

33:17.200 --> 33:20.080
What were you thinking with that Gugino poster?

33:20.080 --> 33:20.960
How could you?

33:20.960 --> 33:23.360
You can't just put a Gugino up in your room.

33:23.920 --> 33:25.920
You put a Carla Gugino poster anywhere.

33:26.800 --> 33:30.880
And you put it so close to the aquarium, you were almost begging for human fish monsters.

33:30.880 --> 33:32.320
Ew, you nasty.

33:32.320 --> 33:34.720
That's what you like, don't you, dirty girl.

33:34.720 --> 33:37.760
You like it when people jerk it to Carla Gugino into your aquarium.

33:37.760 --> 33:38.480
You nasty.

33:39.600 --> 33:42.640
I would also like to say to this girl whose room this is

33:42.640 --> 33:44.960
and who's concerned this is about horrible fish monsters.

33:44.960 --> 33:48.880
Maybe you need to be more selective of the people and you invite into your house.

33:48.880 --> 33:53.040
If you had a party and you don't know which one of them came in your aquarium.

33:53.040 --> 33:54.800
You know, you have to know.

33:56.160 --> 34:02.640
Line up the usual suspects who Gugino'd right into my aquarium.

34:06.640 --> 34:07.920
Didn't think it on through, did you?

34:10.080 --> 34:11.120
Typical.

34:11.120 --> 34:16.480
Typical. Everyone in your life, you should only have one person

34:17.520 --> 34:20.000
that could possibly have jerked it into your aquarium.

34:20.000 --> 34:22.160
If you have less than that, boring.

34:22.160 --> 34:24.960
If you have more than that, you're on bad girls club.

34:24.960 --> 34:28.400
But you need to limit that to one.

34:30.640 --> 34:31.600
One person.

34:31.600 --> 34:32.880
Gotta have one sassy friend.

34:33.520 --> 34:38.400
Gotta have one person who may or may not jerk it into your aquarium.

34:38.400 --> 34:41.120
Just be glad it wasn't a terrarium because yucko.

34:42.160 --> 34:42.560
Yeah.

34:42.560 --> 34:43.440
Double yuck.

34:43.440 --> 34:45.120
That was one pissed off turtle.

34:45.120 --> 34:46.800
That was actually the plot of Biodome 2.

34:47.360 --> 34:47.920
Yeah.

34:47.920 --> 34:51.040
It's stuck in development hell, but perhaps it's perfectly so.

34:51.040 --> 34:52.000
Jesus.

34:52.000 --> 34:52.560
Jesus.

34:52.560 --> 34:54.240
No, he's not involved in this one.

34:54.240 --> 34:56.960
I am thinking about Polly Shore in ways.

34:56.960 --> 34:59.760
I'm thinking about whichever Baldwin that was.

34:59.760 --> 35:02.640
Just, hey, just doing it on a turtle.

35:02.640 --> 35:06.240
Just making love on it.

35:06.240 --> 35:07.360
Now, why did, okay.

35:09.200 --> 35:12.960
Is it possible that they would eat it and make sea moss?

35:13.840 --> 35:16.000
Does she need to be concerned for her safety?

35:16.000 --> 35:18.880
Justin, not only is it possible, it's impossible.

35:19.600 --> 35:21.920
It's not a thing that can happen scientifically.

35:23.200 --> 35:27.040
So you're saying not probable, but it is likely that it could happen.

35:27.600 --> 35:30.160
It's not just going to happen.

35:30.160 --> 35:33.760
It's happened already.

35:33.760 --> 35:35.760
That's where Snooki came from.

35:35.760 --> 35:39.120
Snooki is, she's half beta.

35:39.760 --> 35:42.720
Half beta, half fighting fish.

35:43.920 --> 35:44.880
That's betas, right?

35:44.880 --> 35:46.800
Betas are the Asian fighting fish.

35:46.800 --> 35:47.040
Is that correct?

35:47.040 --> 35:48.480
Yeah, don't put two of those in a tank.

35:48.480 --> 35:51.040
They will wrestle over that semen.

35:51.040 --> 35:52.160
They can be only one.

35:52.160 --> 35:54.480
I think the worst part of this situation-

35:54.480 --> 35:56.800
It really is like an episode of Bad Girls Club at that point.

35:56.800 --> 36:01.920
As this manfish develops, it'll probably get really annoying to constantly have to listen

36:01.920 --> 36:03.680
to Leonard Nimoy describe his life.

36:03.680 --> 36:08.560
Oh, semen deep cut for everyone to enjoy.

36:08.560 --> 36:12.480
We're going to make jokes right now that maybe 10 of you are going to get.

36:12.480 --> 36:13.600
Let's just buckle up for a minute.

36:13.600 --> 36:16.320
That's the bone yard for a semen gag.

36:16.320 --> 36:18.400
Just a real quick semen story.

36:19.280 --> 36:25.360
We went on vacation once and left the adapter for our Dreamcast at home.

36:25.360 --> 36:28.000
And flipped out because our semen were going to die.

36:28.000 --> 36:32.720
Well, okay, not all of us flipped out because I wasn't, I enjoyed, I played semen maybe twice

36:32.720 --> 36:36.160
and the first time it was, oh, I have given birth to men fish.

36:36.160 --> 36:39.600
And then the second time was, let's see how high I can turn up the heat in this tank.

36:41.360 --> 36:41.920
Cook them.

36:41.920 --> 36:45.440
That's the only thing you can do to your betas, by the way, to your half beta half mans.

36:45.440 --> 36:46.160
You got to cook them.

36:46.160 --> 36:47.920
God did not intend for this to happen.

36:47.920 --> 36:49.760
You've got, you've got to boil the water.

36:49.760 --> 36:50.320
I'm sorry.

36:50.320 --> 36:51.360
It's sad.

36:51.360 --> 36:53.920
You got to think about it because God made betta fish.

36:53.920 --> 36:55.520
And he also made semen.

36:55.520 --> 36:58.480
So he had to assume that eventually the two would meet.

36:59.520 --> 37:03.680
Yeah, but I'm going to say that that's not a part of God's wonderful plan.

37:03.680 --> 37:08.000
He also made people, people of different races and religions and he never intended for them to mate.

37:08.000 --> 37:11.600
So what are you, you know, what are you, what are you trying to, what are you getting at?

37:12.960 --> 37:16.000
My, um, my man fish is a pescatarian.

37:20.480 --> 37:21.040
Gross.

37:21.040 --> 37:26.960
Uh, and now a message from our favorite half men, half fish, Jordan, Jesse, go.

37:30.000 --> 37:32.320
I'm Jesse Thorne, America's radio, sweetheart.

37:32.320 --> 37:34.320
I'm Jordan Morris, boy, detective.

37:34.320 --> 37:40.240
Every week on our show, Jordan, Jesse go, I would say that we share a little slice of our hearts.

37:40.240 --> 37:40.960
Yeah.

37:40.960 --> 37:43.360
And a little peek at our dicks.

37:45.360 --> 37:50.080
But every week we have a podcast where we have a little peek at our dicks.

37:50.080 --> 37:55.200
Podcast where we have fun and funny conversations with guests from the worlds of comedy, film,

37:55.200 --> 37:55.920
television.

37:55.920 --> 38:00.480
It's all online at maximum fun.org or just search for Jordan, Jesse go in iTunes.

38:02.240 --> 38:04.000
Tune in you.

38:04.000 --> 38:04.480
You will.

38:04.480 --> 38:06.000
I guarantee you'll enjoy it.

38:06.000 --> 38:06.560
Guaranteed.

38:07.360 --> 38:09.760
Travis, you tell me they talked about werewolf periods this week.

38:09.760 --> 38:10.160
They did.

38:10.160 --> 38:16.000
They talk about werewolf periods and, um, how horrible that must be for the werewolf boyfriends.

38:16.000 --> 38:18.160
I, I know what you guys are thinking.

38:18.160 --> 38:21.760
Uh, boy, they've got special guests out the wazoo.

38:22.880 --> 38:24.960
Why don't you guys ever have any special guests?

38:26.000 --> 38:30.320
And I say, listen, dad, we'll get around to it.

38:30.320 --> 38:31.360
We're trying our best.

38:32.080 --> 38:33.200
We had John Hodgman.

38:33.200 --> 38:33.760
We had you.

38:34.400 --> 38:35.120
It's not enough.

38:36.480 --> 38:41.520
Uh, but actually we do have a special guest question right now from our friends, Chuck and

38:41.520 --> 38:42.020
Josh.

38:42.720 --> 38:43.680
Uh, Hey guys.

38:44.320 --> 38:45.200
Hi, hi.

38:45.200 --> 38:48.000
It's, uh, Josh and Chuck.

38:48.000 --> 38:49.040
That's Chuck's voice.

38:49.600 --> 38:51.120
And we have a question for you.

38:51.120 --> 38:53.200
Well, we're from the stuff you should know podcast.

38:53.200 --> 38:53.760
Yes.

38:53.760 --> 38:54.960
And we have, we have a question.

38:54.960 --> 38:55.120
Yeah.

38:55.120 --> 38:55.760
We have a question.

38:55.760 --> 38:56.560
Very important question.

38:56.560 --> 38:59.200
Uh, we're both very interested in learning this.

38:59.200 --> 39:08.000
Um, how would one, if one needed to, or wanted to say, get rid of, um, a muffin top, I believe

39:08.000 --> 39:09.600
is the colloquialism for it.

39:09.600 --> 39:10.240
Men or women?

39:10.240 --> 39:10.800
Both.

39:10.800 --> 39:12.240
It doesn't matter, but yeah.

39:12.240 --> 39:14.800
Well, let's say, let's say a man wanted it now.

39:14.800 --> 39:15.300
Okay.

39:15.600 --> 39:17.760
That's, that's a question to ask our question guys.

39:17.760 --> 39:18.640
Let's hear it.

39:18.640 --> 39:20.560
A fine, a fine question guys.

39:20.560 --> 39:23.120
I'm as somebody who I have met Chuck.

39:23.120 --> 39:24.240
I have not personally met Josh.

39:24.240 --> 39:28.560
I don't, I do not believe either of these gentlemen suffer from muffin top.

39:28.560 --> 39:31.520
I don't, I don't believe either of them are rocking that look.

39:31.520 --> 39:35.600
You know, I think they're just mining us for information that they can steal wholesale

39:35.600 --> 39:39.440
and then use on their podcasts, which is full of enriching information.

39:39.440 --> 39:39.680
Right.

39:39.680 --> 39:40.480
This is how they get it.

39:40.480 --> 39:44.800
They, they send guest questions into other podcasts and then wheeze off that juice.

39:44.800 --> 39:45.360
Yeah, wheeze it.

39:45.920 --> 39:52.880
Here's my first, my first sort of sub, sub answer is, do you need to get rid of it?

39:52.880 --> 39:55.600
Some people can lean into that look.

39:56.160 --> 39:59.200
Some people don't need to get rid of the muffin top.

39:59.200 --> 40:00.720
Society may want you to.

40:00.720 --> 40:02.240
Some people don't need to.

40:02.240 --> 40:03.680
Some people have a great look.

40:04.640 --> 40:07.440
That Pattinson kid, Steve Pat, Steve Pattinson.

40:07.440 --> 40:08.480
What's his name?

40:08.480 --> 40:09.920
Steve Pattinson from Twilight.

40:09.920 --> 40:10.720
From Teen Vampire.

40:10.720 --> 40:11.200
What's it?

40:11.200 --> 40:11.760
What's it?

40:11.760 --> 40:12.480
He's got.

40:12.480 --> 40:13.760
Roger, Roger Pattinson.

40:13.760 --> 40:15.360
Roger, Roger Pattinson.

40:15.360 --> 40:20.880
He's got some stuff hanging over the sides, like a Santa costume hanging on a costume rack.

40:20.880 --> 40:22.560
He's, he is convex.

40:22.560 --> 40:24.320
There's no, there's no.

40:24.320 --> 40:25.680
He shaved like a Hershey Kiss.

40:25.680 --> 40:27.840
Steve Pattinson was my favorite James Bond.

40:29.760 --> 40:34.320
People talk a lot about Roger Moorings and, and Glenn Tyler.

40:35.120 --> 40:37.360
I really like Steve Pattinson.

40:37.360 --> 40:42.160
But I'm just saying it's a good look because it looks like a, it looks like a,

40:42.160 --> 40:45.600
it looks like you got your shirt tucked in to your pants and you got a little bit,

40:45.600 --> 40:48.080
well, got a little bit coming out, but that's just your flesh.

40:48.800 --> 40:49.040
Yeah.

40:49.040 --> 40:50.160
I think it's very natural.

40:50.160 --> 40:51.360
I think most people have them.

40:51.360 --> 40:51.600
Sure.

40:52.160 --> 40:52.800
I've got them.

40:53.360 --> 40:54.160
Just more to love.

40:55.280 --> 40:59.920
Now, Travis, you're sort of our fitness go-to fitness guy because you get, you get,

40:59.920 --> 41:02.320
you get active, I think, on a daily basis.

41:02.320 --> 41:02.720
I do.

41:02.720 --> 41:03.760
What are your tips?

41:03.760 --> 41:07.040
What are your tips for getting rid of the, the old MT as we call it?

41:07.040 --> 41:11.360
As you know, I research muffin tops just about every day.

41:11.360 --> 41:11.840
Yeah, right.

41:12.480 --> 41:16.800
And what I've learned is that there are just as many helpful suggestions as there are bad

41:16.800 --> 41:17.440
suggestions.

41:17.440 --> 41:17.840
Sure.

41:17.840 --> 41:22.400
And something I learned that was very interesting is that, you know, people think of like doing

41:22.400 --> 41:23.760
sit-ups and crunches and everything.

41:23.760 --> 41:24.480
Not going to help, is it?

41:24.480 --> 41:25.600
It just makes it more robust.

41:25.600 --> 41:28.480
No, it tones the muscle underneath, but it won't get rid of the fat.

41:29.280 --> 41:33.280
But my favorite suggestion that I read was buy looser clothes.

41:33.920 --> 41:34.720
Okay.

41:34.720 --> 41:38.080
That does, that does, it looks like you're wearing like MC Hammer shirt.

41:38.080 --> 41:43.040
Well, apparently there's a concern that if you wear pants that are too tight, it forms

41:43.040 --> 41:44.560
you into a muffin top.

41:44.560 --> 41:44.960
Sure.

41:44.960 --> 41:47.520
No, it squeezes your leg meat up to your tummy area.

41:47.520 --> 41:47.920
It does.

41:47.920 --> 41:49.440
It pops out like a toothpaste tube.

41:49.440 --> 41:53.120
Yeah, your meat, your meat is very malleable.

41:53.120 --> 41:54.320
You can, you can go all over.

41:54.320 --> 41:56.480
You can make yourself conical if you want.

41:57.200 --> 42:02.640
You know, in the, in the 1800s, corsets were so tight that sometimes girls' legs bones would

42:02.640 --> 42:06.720
pop out of their tum-tums and it would make a bone muffin top.

42:06.720 --> 42:07.200
Yeah.

42:07.200 --> 42:07.920
I have muffin tops.

42:07.920 --> 42:09.360
They call it the stale muffin top.

42:09.360 --> 42:11.760
It's pretty, pretty brutal up there.

42:11.760 --> 42:15.120
I have muffin tops, but they are around my collarbone areas.

42:15.120 --> 42:15.680
Yeah, sure.

42:15.680 --> 42:17.200
Just because that's where I want them.

42:17.200 --> 42:20.480
That's where I've smooshed, I've smooshed them up to my collarbone reach.

42:20.480 --> 42:24.880
But you're always wearing that adorable little Lord Fauntleroy collar cinched up.

42:24.880 --> 42:25.440
I do.

42:25.440 --> 42:26.240
A ruff.

42:26.240 --> 42:26.480
Yeah.

42:26.480 --> 42:27.360
He wears a ruff.

42:27.360 --> 42:35.200
I look like some sort of judge, some sort of, some sort of old, old British judge.

42:35.200 --> 42:35.440
Yeah.

42:35.440 --> 42:37.760
Like some sort of old British judge.

42:37.760 --> 42:39.920
He looks like Rumpole of the Bailey up there.

42:41.280 --> 42:42.080
Good luck.

42:42.080 --> 42:45.520
I think everyone knew what I was talking about when I said an old British judge.

42:46.720 --> 42:50.160
Well, if that doesn't conjure just a clear mental image, I don't know what does.

42:50.160 --> 42:50.400
Sure.

42:51.200 --> 42:53.280
You know, I actually look like Ashley Judge.

42:53.280 --> 42:55.920
I look like Judge Reinhold.

42:55.920 --> 42:59.200
You look like Judge Dredd, but like if he was fat.

43:00.560 --> 43:02.640
I look like a fat Judge Dredd.

43:02.640 --> 43:04.320
Dude, that is a good look.

43:04.320 --> 43:05.360
You got a muffin top?

43:05.360 --> 43:07.600
You look like fat Judge Dredd.

43:09.600 --> 43:14.400
I would rather have muffin tops than these damn muffin bottoms.

43:14.400 --> 43:14.880
Yeah.

43:14.880 --> 43:19.040
Coming out the box, kind of oozing around your, are you wearing Reebok pumps?

43:19.040 --> 43:19.600
I am not.

43:19.600 --> 43:23.200
What if you have these striped, striped, striped, striped, striped tops?

43:23.200 --> 43:27.520
Sort of alien cylinders coming out of your hips and I don't know what's going on.

43:27.520 --> 43:29.200
Are those wrapped in paper?

43:29.200 --> 43:30.320
What's going on?

43:30.320 --> 43:34.080
Those are, are those gel out soles for your, is that comfortable?

43:34.080 --> 43:35.840
Is that a, it's for your arch.

43:35.840 --> 43:39.840
Your muffin bottom fills in the arch for your shoes and gives you a real nice, it's like

43:39.840 --> 43:42.160
gliding, which you've never experienced that.

43:42.160 --> 43:46.880
Hey, hey, why don't you put down the corn dog, pick up a carrot.

43:48.320 --> 43:49.680
Where'd those muffin tops go?

43:49.680 --> 43:53.120
They're gone and you can see really well because of all the carotene.

43:53.120 --> 43:55.680
You can see everyone else's muffin tops and judge them.

43:57.040 --> 44:01.600
Just, what if you were just constantly a hundred percent of the time doing like side bends

44:02.240 --> 44:03.280
and twists like all the time.

44:03.280 --> 44:04.240
No, no, no, no.

44:04.240 --> 44:05.120
You don't want that.

44:05.120 --> 44:07.600
You don't want, you don't want an hourglass shape.

44:07.600 --> 44:10.880
That's what Jack LaLanne looked, didn't look what happened to him.

44:10.880 --> 44:12.320
Didn't work out for him.

44:12.320 --> 44:14.400
He only lived to be 143.

44:15.040 --> 44:15.280
Yeah.

44:15.280 --> 44:17.120
And he could bench press a Volkswagen.

44:17.120 --> 44:20.240
He could beat up a fucking bull with his fists.

44:21.840 --> 44:22.640
Jack LaLanne.

44:22.640 --> 44:23.600
I miss you, Jackie.

44:24.320 --> 44:25.200
I'm glad he's gone.

44:26.160 --> 44:27.200
Wait, hold on.

44:27.200 --> 44:29.200
Why are you glad Jack LaLanne's dead?

44:29.200 --> 44:30.080
Because he scared me.

44:30.800 --> 44:32.480
Because of his long life?

44:32.480 --> 44:32.720
Yeah.

44:32.720 --> 44:33.680
He intimidated me.

44:34.320 --> 44:39.760
I did feel like he was, he was kind of, he was, I think, I think after 70, if you're

44:39.760 --> 44:42.400
active, you're active in a real judgy way.

44:42.400 --> 44:46.320
Like I think you're, you're judgy fit if you're past 70 and still fit.

44:46.320 --> 44:52.320
To know that I, as a 27 year old male would not be able to outrun a 126 year old dude.

44:52.320 --> 44:52.720
Sure.

44:52.720 --> 44:54.320
It made me feel bad every day.

44:54.320 --> 44:57.440
I woke up every day going, well, I'm not going to be as good as Jack LaLanne today.

44:57.440 --> 45:02.560
When you see someone who is 151 goddamn years old, you're not supposed, you're not supposed

45:02.560 --> 45:04.720
to see a muscly old.

45:04.720 --> 45:08.240
If that's like seeing like a really, like seeing like a really tall cat.

45:08.800 --> 45:12.880
Like it's just not, it's not a trait that that thing can have.

45:12.880 --> 45:13.120
Right.

45:13.120 --> 45:17.760
And there's that motherfucker who's always in the airplane magazines that, you know,

45:17.760 --> 45:21.280
that one guy who's got an old man's head for the young man's body.

45:21.280 --> 45:21.520
Yeah.

45:21.520 --> 45:23.200
He said he did it with science.

45:23.200 --> 45:26.160
That's that, that guy talk about nightmares.

45:26.720 --> 45:32.640
He he is obviously the product of human beta cross breeding.

45:33.200 --> 45:34.400
I'm going to be honest with you guys.

45:34.400 --> 45:39.120
I don't know how Jack LaLanne died, but I assume it was like a Rasputin kind of thing,

45:39.120 --> 45:39.360
right?

45:39.360 --> 45:43.840
Yeah, he, they were stabbed 14 times and then wrapped in a carpet and thrown off a bridge.

45:44.560 --> 45:45.760
That's the only way to bring him down.

45:46.480 --> 45:49.600
I actually had to wake up in the middle of the night and put a steak in his heart.

45:49.600 --> 45:51.280
It was really unfortunate.

45:51.280 --> 45:54.320
His only weakness is being stabbed 14 times.

45:56.640 --> 46:01.120
Someone had to blow off a dusty old tome to try that in for him.

46:01.120 --> 46:03.520
Jack, you were trying to bring down a Jack LaLanne.

46:05.120 --> 46:06.960
I believe I have one book here.

46:06.960 --> 46:11.840
Pecure a true silver knife and then stab him.

46:11.840 --> 46:13.520
Not 13, not 15.

46:14.400 --> 46:21.360
The 15th shall reawaken him with more vitriol than ever.

46:21.360 --> 46:23.520
Thou shalt not stab him a baker's dozen.

46:25.120 --> 46:28.240
Upon the 16th Sabbath, he will arise again.

46:28.240 --> 46:31.040
Try to sell you a juice machine branded with his name.

46:32.640 --> 46:34.480
That's the secret, by the way, everybody.

46:34.480 --> 46:37.680
Juice, juice, juice.

46:37.680 --> 46:38.720
Can you just cut them off?

46:40.000 --> 46:42.560
Cut those tops off and then stitch it, stitch it back together.

46:42.560 --> 46:44.160
You don't got any organs in there, right?

46:44.160 --> 46:45.920
Unless your kidneys get real lazy.

46:45.920 --> 46:47.520
Just like, oh, I'll flop.

46:49.040 --> 46:50.640
I'm not trying very hard.

46:50.640 --> 46:52.560
I'm sleeping in a skin hammock.

46:53.840 --> 46:56.640
That's what my kidneys sound like.

46:56.640 --> 46:58.240
My kidneys are fucking old.

46:59.280 --> 47:00.160
All kidneys are old.

47:00.160 --> 47:01.280
So tired.

47:01.280 --> 47:02.080
So tired.

47:02.080 --> 47:05.040
You know, a new person can't be born until an old person dies and they take their kidneys.

47:05.040 --> 47:07.360
We're using the same kidneys from Adam and Eve, guys.

47:07.360 --> 47:07.520
Sure.

47:08.160 --> 47:09.040
What about duct tape?

47:11.040 --> 47:11.680
Duct tape it back.

47:11.680 --> 47:13.440
Like give yourself a duct tape corset.

47:13.440 --> 47:14.320
I like that.

47:14.320 --> 47:15.520
Duct tape corset.

47:15.520 --> 47:20.480
That was the band that the All American Rejects lead singer was in before he got-

47:20.480 --> 47:21.520
They reformed without him.

47:21.520 --> 47:22.560
Reformed without him.

47:23.200 --> 47:24.560
It's duct tape corset.

47:26.080 --> 47:31.920
I don't like that because then I'm imagining you taping up your rolls on the side and it

47:31.920 --> 47:36.640
looks like it's going to look like your torso is smiling and it's going to be weird for everyone.

47:36.640 --> 47:37.600
It's going to push up.

47:37.600 --> 47:42.240
You can't squish a muffin top away because then you're just going to end up with like

47:42.800 --> 47:44.080
a muffin chest piece.

47:45.120 --> 47:47.600
That's what Christina Hendricks has been rocking that look.

47:47.600 --> 47:49.120
I guess it's working out well for her.

47:49.120 --> 47:49.680
Poor girl.

47:49.680 --> 47:50.720
That poor, poor girl.

47:50.720 --> 47:51.200
Yeah.

47:51.200 --> 47:52.560
That's actually two muffin tops.

47:52.560 --> 47:54.880
She's got a horribly deformed body.

47:54.880 --> 47:55.120
Yeah.

47:55.840 --> 47:58.400
She is really, really misshapen.

47:58.400 --> 47:59.040
It's a real tragedy.

47:59.040 --> 47:59.840
So sad.

47:59.840 --> 48:03.120
Our national obsession with her has to end.

48:03.120 --> 48:04.880
What are we teaching our children?

48:04.880 --> 48:06.000
Tape up the muffin tops?

48:06.720 --> 48:11.440
I saw a nine-year-old girl yesterday with a duct tape record.

48:11.440 --> 48:11.920
I can't.

48:12.480 --> 48:14.720
I actually thought I could, but it turned out that I can't.

48:14.720 --> 48:18.960
So Chuck and Josh, we hope that that answers your question-ish.

48:19.600 --> 48:21.920
Tape them up and get those Hendricks boobs.

48:21.920 --> 48:22.960
They're going to love it.

48:22.960 --> 48:24.160
Christina Hendricks look.

48:25.040 --> 48:26.800
Sorry to the family of Jacqueline.

48:26.800 --> 48:27.360
Sorry Jacqueline.

48:27.360 --> 48:28.160
We didn't mean it.

48:28.160 --> 48:29.040
We didn't mean it.

48:29.040 --> 48:29.680
Yeah.

48:29.680 --> 48:34.720
And if you want to listen to those guys, search iTunes for stuff you should know.

48:34.720 --> 48:40.160
It is an informative podcast about a different topic every week.

48:40.160 --> 48:44.640
And it'll make you an expert on things and make you interesting to talk to, unlike now,

48:44.640 --> 48:46.880
where you just recite the bullshit that we say.

48:46.880 --> 48:48.160
And that's all lies.

48:48.160 --> 48:49.200
We make all that up.

48:50.400 --> 48:51.760
Do you guys know what day it is?

48:52.560 --> 48:53.840
Oh, shit.

48:53.840 --> 48:54.560
It's our birthday.

48:54.560 --> 48:54.880
We don't have to do it.

48:54.880 --> 48:55.440
It's our birthday.

48:55.440 --> 48:55.920
Stop it.

48:55.920 --> 48:56.800
Happy birthday.

48:56.800 --> 49:00.880
Um, I do have a, it's a, it's a day of the month though.

49:00.880 --> 49:01.360
It's a month.

49:01.360 --> 49:02.320
It's a special month.

49:03.600 --> 49:10.560
Um, it is, I didn't pick it, but I'm going to say there's banana pudding lovers month.

49:10.560 --> 49:13.760
And I don't think that's going to get anything better than that.

49:13.760 --> 49:19.760
Uh, should you explain what you're doing?

49:19.760 --> 49:24.160
Oh, every month we take a subject, a national month observance.

49:24.160 --> 49:26.560
It's, there's gotta be a better way to say it.

49:26.560 --> 49:26.800
Right?

49:27.760 --> 49:28.240
Yeah.

49:28.240 --> 49:31.680
Well, there's a better way to say it than stop doing it because it's our month's bit.

49:31.680 --> 49:34.240
Every month Griffin makes me and Justin sad.

49:34.800 --> 49:35.120
Sure.

49:35.120 --> 49:41.920
Now, now we have another bit where Travis basically just screams nonsense for 10 minutes.

49:41.920 --> 49:43.520
And I like it better than this bit.

49:43.520 --> 49:48.320
But you like, you like his fucking Adam Sandler fucking riffs?

49:48.320 --> 49:49.840
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

49:49.840 --> 49:51.600
How dare you, sir?

49:52.240 --> 49:53.360
How dare you?

49:53.360 --> 49:54.480
How dare you?

49:54.480 --> 49:55.680
Jack and Jill in theaters.

49:55.680 --> 49:57.680
Don't you fucking bring Jack and Jill into this.

50:00.800 --> 50:01.520
Oh my God.

50:01.520 --> 50:02.880
On Survivor this week.

50:02.880 --> 50:06.720
I don't want to change this subject, but Survivor is actually a couple of weeks ago.

50:06.720 --> 50:11.840
Their reward was an exclusive screen of Jack and Jill.

50:11.840 --> 50:16.000
They, those other fuckers went on an island alone for 18 days.

50:16.000 --> 50:16.400
Nothing.

50:16.400 --> 50:19.280
No, no entertainment whatsoever.

50:19.280 --> 50:21.600
They get to go to a theater and see Jack and Jill.

50:21.600 --> 50:26.240
There was actually a Jack and Jill themed challenge.

50:26.240 --> 50:30.000
And then the winner, the winner, and I use that like in the loosest sense of the word,

50:30.000 --> 50:37.280
but like backwards sense of the word, got to go to a sort of straw theater and watch Jack and Jill.

50:37.280 --> 50:41.440
Is it worth the challenge to vomit on a plate and see how many people you get to eat it?

50:41.440 --> 50:42.640
Yeah, the game.

50:42.640 --> 50:42.880
Yeah.

50:43.600 --> 50:44.880
What a great metaphor.

50:44.880 --> 50:45.280
Yeah.

50:45.280 --> 50:47.920
Adam Sandler's been playing that game for years now.

50:47.920 --> 50:53.200
Uh, and, and actually the year before was, was Gulliver's Travels.

50:53.200 --> 50:55.200
Oh, Survivor.

50:55.200 --> 50:55.520
Yeah.

50:55.520 --> 50:56.400
Survivor.

50:56.400 --> 50:57.760
That's just part of the-

50:57.760 --> 51:01.760
It was, it was, I don't know if I would prefer to be the guy who fell asleep and fell into

51:01.760 --> 51:03.280
a fire that one time.

51:03.280 --> 51:06.800
He's got a better, he was watching Survivor this year and was like, well, it's way tougher

51:06.800 --> 51:07.760
than it used to be.

51:07.760 --> 51:09.120
They got to sit through Jack and Jill.

51:09.920 --> 51:15.200
I, uh, I like to think that the people on that island think, man, we've only been here

51:15.200 --> 51:21.200
for 18 days and already the civilized world has devolved into some sort of apocalyptic

51:21.200 --> 51:25.680
movie scape where Adam Sandler plays every part in every movie.

51:25.680 --> 51:27.280
All the actresses are dead.

51:27.280 --> 51:28.480
All the actresses are dead.

51:28.480 --> 51:29.920
All the actors are dead.

51:29.920 --> 51:30.640
Save one.

51:31.680 --> 51:32.880
Save the Sandman.

51:32.880 --> 51:34.160
Save the Sander.

51:34.160 --> 51:40.720
I wish you to, wish you to dreamland, take you away to an entertainment nightmare escape.

51:41.440 --> 51:43.200
It's national impotency month.

51:43.760 --> 51:44.320
Okay.

51:44.320 --> 51:45.360
Oh, what a letdown.

51:49.200 --> 51:56.400
Um, it is, oh man, it's not, not that much funny shit in this list.

51:57.200 --> 52:01.360
You guys just want to do banana pudding lovers month and then pull it off like a bandaid.

52:01.360 --> 52:01.680
Yeah.

52:01.680 --> 52:03.760
Banana pudding lovers month would be great.

52:03.760 --> 52:03.920
Yeah.

52:06.000 --> 52:06.720
I like it.

52:06.720 --> 52:09.040
I like to throw some pillow wafers in there.

52:09.040 --> 52:11.360
Don't, of course, but of course.

52:11.360 --> 52:14.000
How about, um, hey, get your dick out of there.

52:14.000 --> 52:14.320
Yeah.

52:14.320 --> 52:15.760
Banana pudding lovers month.

52:15.760 --> 52:17.280
That's not where dicks go.

52:17.280 --> 52:18.240
No, come on guys.

52:18.240 --> 52:19.040
But I get it.

52:19.040 --> 52:20.000
My brother, my brother and me.

52:20.000 --> 52:23.600
Can we just work clean just once, please?

52:23.600 --> 52:24.560
Yum, yum.

52:24.560 --> 52:25.760
Looks delicious.

52:25.760 --> 52:26.960
My brother, my brother and me.

52:28.160 --> 52:30.720
Affordable and easy to make for the mom on the go.

52:31.840 --> 52:32.400
Banana pudding lovers.

52:32.400 --> 52:35.440
Nothing says I love you like a big bowl of banana pudding.

52:36.160 --> 52:37.600
My brother, my brother and me.

52:37.600 --> 52:40.320
Um, make this for your pet orangutan.

52:40.320 --> 52:40.880
He'll love it.

52:40.880 --> 52:42.560
He'll go ape.

52:42.560 --> 52:44.720
He'll go ape for banana pudding.

52:44.720 --> 52:48.320
Your pet orangutan will go ape for banana pudding.

52:48.320 --> 52:49.520
My brother, my brother and me.

52:49.520 --> 52:50.960
Only terrorists eat chocolate.

52:52.400 --> 52:53.600
You don't like bananas.

52:53.600 --> 52:55.120
You must be putting me on.

52:55.120 --> 52:57.280
My brother, my brother and me.

52:57.280 --> 52:58.000
Hello.

52:58.000 --> 52:59.120
Hello Jello.

52:59.120 --> 53:00.320
Banana pudding.

53:00.320 --> 53:01.520
My brother, my brother and me.

53:01.520 --> 53:01.840
It's good.

53:01.840 --> 53:07.440
Time to do a jihad on rice pudding because you hate it so much.

53:07.440 --> 53:08.080
Right?

53:08.080 --> 53:08.640
That's good.

53:08.640 --> 53:09.920
Like orangutans.

53:09.920 --> 53:12.400
I guess bananas.

53:12.400 --> 53:13.840
Like I'm really, I'm scraping grass.

53:14.960 --> 53:20.640
I can see the appeal of banana pudding.

53:22.320 --> 53:23.520
My brother, my brother and me.

53:23.520 --> 53:24.720
That was a slip.

53:24.720 --> 53:29.280
Um, uh, uh, hey, don't, don't split.

53:31.040 --> 53:35.120
Stick around and have some welcome to my brother, my brother, me.

53:35.120 --> 53:42.320
And if I show for your, your grandpa's grandpa, he's going to love these gags.

53:42.320 --> 53:44.080
We're talking about Jacqueline.

53:44.080 --> 53:45.840
We're doing some great pudding puns.

53:46.640 --> 53:47.600
Next, next week.

53:47.600 --> 53:53.920
Join us as Sid Caesar takes us on a journey to Laugh Town with his hilarious character.

53:53.920 --> 53:58.640
Jui, Jui, Jui McMidget.

53:58.640 --> 54:04.240
It's a Irish Jewish, uh, little person stereotype that, uh, I think you're really going to get

54:04.240 --> 54:05.120
a kick out of that character.

54:05.120 --> 54:09.280
He's been working on it, working at the cat skills, honing his character.

54:09.280 --> 54:11.280
Make sure you and your g-pa turn in.

54:11.920 --> 54:13.680
With special guys, Zero Mostel.

54:16.240 --> 54:17.520
From Fiddler on the Roof.

54:17.520 --> 54:19.280
It's going to be a great hour of entertainment.

54:19.280 --> 54:22.640
Of course, we will have a mandatory prayer in the middle of it.

54:22.640 --> 54:24.320
So it's going to be a really great night.

54:24.320 --> 54:25.280
Come on out.

54:25.280 --> 54:28.240
What's the best brand of battery for my hearing device?

54:30.400 --> 54:32.080
What's up with the young people today?

54:32.080 --> 54:35.680
Uh, if you and your g-pa show up 30 minutes early, you can hit the buffet.

54:35.680 --> 54:37.040
Just $7.95.

54:37.040 --> 54:38.480
Got some real nice borscht on there.

54:39.040 --> 54:41.280
It's, uh, got some real nice potatoes.

54:41.280 --> 54:43.040
It's a great, it's a great time for everybody.

54:43.040 --> 54:43.440
So come on out.

54:43.440 --> 54:48.560
Make my brother, my brother, and me the last thing you listen to before you die of old age.

54:49.360 --> 54:50.400
We'll goof you to sleep.

54:52.880 --> 54:54.400
Goof you to sleep, g-pa.

54:54.400 --> 54:56.000
Here, we'll goof you up to heaven.

54:56.000 --> 54:58.720
May a choir of angels goof thee to thy rest.

54:58.720 --> 55:00.960
We are the Cracker Barrel podcast.

55:00.960 --> 55:02.160
Come on down.

55:02.160 --> 55:04.160
Yep, you're going to love it.

55:04.160 --> 55:05.760
We're the sweatpants podcast.

55:05.760 --> 55:07.360
Just slip us on and slip off.

55:08.000 --> 55:09.600
Slip off to dreamland.

55:09.600 --> 55:10.960
Slip off to dreamland.

55:10.960 --> 55:14.960
Pop in those buds and think about your life.

55:14.960 --> 55:15.680
Don't.

55:15.680 --> 55:16.480
Hey, g-pa.

55:16.480 --> 55:20.080
I don't want you to go out like Jack O'Lane with a bunch of gung-tofs stabbing you with

55:20.080 --> 55:20.720
a silver knife.

55:22.000 --> 55:26.000
I want you to die with dignity and jokes about banana pudding.

55:26.720 --> 55:27.200
Tune in.

55:27.840 --> 55:29.600
Did we cover all of our bases?

55:29.600 --> 55:33.280
I feel like there's not a goddamn thing that I could have said.

55:34.880 --> 55:35.520
I mean, we did.

55:35.520 --> 55:37.600
We did make a bunch of jokes.

55:37.600 --> 55:37.840
Yeah.

55:39.120 --> 55:41.520
Orange, you glad I didn't say banana pudding?

55:43.600 --> 55:45.680
What are we fucking doing anymore?

55:46.960 --> 55:47.680
This isn't what-

55:48.800 --> 55:49.520
Let's end the show.

55:50.240 --> 55:52.720
Yeah, this is what we do now.

55:52.720 --> 55:54.000
We tell jokes.

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
It's a joke for us to tell jokes.

55:56.000 --> 56:00.960
If we tell a joke, it's so ironic that we would actually tell a joke rather than talking

56:00.960 --> 56:05.120
about killing Jack O'Lane with a silver knife, that we're laughing at the fact that we actually

56:05.120 --> 56:07.280
try to tell a few good jokes.

56:07.280 --> 56:08.240
Justin, Justin.

56:08.240 --> 56:09.440
Some solid gag.

56:09.440 --> 56:12.000
Hey, that split thing I did, you remember?

56:12.000 --> 56:12.960
That was good stuff.

56:13.840 --> 56:15.360
A true silver knife.

56:15.360 --> 56:20.000
If you stab Jack O'Lane with a silver knife, he will only get stronger.

56:20.000 --> 56:26.320
And angrier and juicier.

56:26.320 --> 56:30.400
Thank you to Chuck and Josh for sending in a question.

56:30.400 --> 56:32.480
Thank you to you guys for listening.

56:32.480 --> 56:36.640
I want to hear Griffin's last question, but first some super quick housekeeping stuff.

56:37.520 --> 56:38.480
You know he's gonna-

56:38.480 --> 56:40.560
Okay, I will prove the existence of ghosts this week.

56:40.560 --> 56:43.600
If Jack O'Lane does not haunt any of us, ghosts don't exist.

56:45.520 --> 56:46.800
We got a new shirt.

56:46.800 --> 56:47.440
It is out.

56:47.440 --> 56:50.400
It is a Peepum's Nasty Gum shirt.

56:50.400 --> 56:52.960
It is at maxfunstore.com.

56:52.960 --> 56:54.080
You can go there.

56:54.080 --> 56:56.320
It is our second t-shirt.

56:56.320 --> 56:59.120
It is a lovely brown color.

56:59.120 --> 57:03.920
It advertises that you have terrible taste in gum.

57:04.480 --> 57:09.280
Designed by Charlene Tadevsky, I think is what I'm gonna go with.

57:09.920 --> 57:15.040
That's on a nice American Apparel t-shirt in camel and brown for the ladies.

57:15.040 --> 57:16.000
It's dope.

57:16.000 --> 57:16.640
It is dope.

57:16.640 --> 57:20.320
And you can get over to Max Fun Store and pick that up for yourself.

57:20.320 --> 57:22.000
Why not get a few for the holidays?

57:22.000 --> 57:27.440
And you can save $5 when you buy three shirts.

57:28.640 --> 57:29.920
So yeah, get that.

57:30.960 --> 57:32.000
What else is going on, guys?

57:33.280 --> 57:36.480
Can we talk about another important monthly observance that's going on?

57:36.480 --> 57:37.120
Yeah.

57:37.120 --> 57:40.640
It's Movember, which Justin and I are participating in.

57:40.640 --> 57:44.560
Travis, the only person who can grow facial hair with any level of confidence,

57:44.560 --> 57:45.520
for some reason, is not present.

57:45.520 --> 57:46.720
I'm growing it right now.

57:48.240 --> 57:51.440
But yeah, Justin and I are both raising money in Movember

57:52.400 --> 57:55.360
to raise awareness for prostate cancer.

57:55.360 --> 57:59.120
And yeah, if you search on the Movember site for either one of us,

57:59.120 --> 58:01.200
you can find us and give us a donation.

58:01.920 --> 58:03.840
And it's for a really great cause.

58:03.840 --> 58:07.280
And I have never seen Justin with any facial hair,

58:07.280 --> 58:10.960
so I just can't wait to see what happens on the lower half of his face.

58:11.520 --> 58:13.920
But yeah, thanks to everybody who's already donated.

58:13.920 --> 58:18.320
Joshua Kost, Don Schultz, both gave pretty sizable donations to me.

58:18.320 --> 58:18.960
Very generous.

58:18.960 --> 58:19.920
Thank you, gentlemen.

58:19.920 --> 58:20.800
Thank you very much.

58:20.800 --> 58:22.000
Our boy, Davin.

58:22.000 --> 58:23.760
Davin Pavlis.

58:23.760 --> 58:24.480
Thank you.

58:24.480 --> 58:25.680
Thanks to everybody, seriously.

58:25.680 --> 58:30.000
And yeah, if you give a donation, then I get your email address.

58:30.000 --> 58:33.280
I will send you a personal email and name one mustache here after you.

58:33.280 --> 58:34.560
That's the current deal.

58:34.560 --> 58:36.080
And I'll send you good vibes.

58:36.080 --> 58:37.520
Justin will just vibe out.

58:37.520 --> 58:39.600
I'll just send those vibes straight out to you.

58:40.720 --> 58:42.480
Make sure, by the way, we mentioned Jordan and Jesse go.

58:42.480 --> 58:44.320
They're coming up on their 200th episode.

58:44.320 --> 58:44.960
Is that this week?

58:45.760 --> 58:46.560
It's next week.

58:46.560 --> 58:46.960
Next week.

58:46.960 --> 58:48.240
So make sure you tune into that.

58:48.240 --> 58:51.600
If you would like us to talk about you and you're not our boss,

58:51.600 --> 58:56.560
so you have to make us like Jesse, you can get on the Jumbotron.

58:56.560 --> 58:57.760
It's maximumfun.org.

58:59.360 --> 59:01.680
And we will do a personal message for you.

59:03.360 --> 59:06.560
We also have forums at maximumfun.org as long as you're over there.

59:06.560 --> 59:09.360
Go talk about the new episode, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

59:09.360 --> 59:13.760
Oh, Griffin, the big, the big, the big news.

59:13.760 --> 59:14.080
Oh, yeah.

59:14.080 --> 59:14.960
Let's drop this on me.

59:16.080 --> 59:17.200
Travis, you want to do it?

59:17.840 --> 59:18.400
No.

59:18.400 --> 59:20.400
Seems appropriate if Griffin does it.

59:20.400 --> 59:21.360
OK, Griffin, you do it.

59:21.360 --> 59:23.920
So we've been planning some live shows for a while.

59:23.920 --> 59:25.920
And the next one that we are trying to do,

59:25.920 --> 59:28.800
we're going to go ahead and announce it on the show through our hat over the fence.

59:28.800 --> 59:33.200
It's still in the planning phase, but I think it's going to come together.

59:33.200 --> 59:33.920
Pretty good chance.

59:33.920 --> 59:39.360
The weekend of December the 11th, right?

59:39.360 --> 59:43.520
December the 10th or 11th, probably the 11th is when that will go down.

59:43.520 --> 59:44.480
Yeah, it's a Sunday.

59:44.480 --> 59:50.400
We are going to attempt to do a live show in my current home city of Austin, Texas.

59:51.600 --> 59:54.960
So we will hopefully have more details for you next week.

59:55.520 --> 01:00:01.200
Start planning on not doing any shit that weekend so you can come out and see us.

01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:06.400
If you live in Austin or have lived in Austin and you have a good idea for a venue,

01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:09.680
if you would email us at mbmbam.com.

01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:13.440
A venue or a place nearby to get crazy afterwards.

01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:18.640
Yeah, mbmbam.com at maximumfun.org and drop us a line.

01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:21.200
We've got a few places in mind, but we haven't locked anything down.

01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:25.040
And if you think you have a winning solution, then please let us know.

01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:28.080
And yeah, we're going to get a combo spot would also be great

01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:30.000
if we can perform there and then hang there.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.160
Afterwards would also be awesome.

01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:38.960
So yeah, that's the second weekend of December and I'm going to try and get it together.

01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:41.920
Try to get Justin and Travis down here in the ATX.

01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:45.520
Yeah, so that is our first one coming up.

01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:47.360
That'll be actually our third live show.

01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:52.080
We're trying to get to every city in this great land, but it's a big undertaking.

01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:59.200
But we will have more live shows, some back at the East Coast, all over this great land.

01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:01.600
So stick with us.

01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:06.400
But if you're in Austin, clear your schedules because I promise that we will try.

01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:09.600
Or Houston or San Antan, San Antany.

01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:13.280
Now, San Antan, the S-A-X, is that the SACS?

01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:16.800
Yeah, or what's the big one?

01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:17.520
Dallas, yeah.

01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:18.960
Dallas, you're pretty cool too.

01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:19.520
Dax.

01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:24.640
So Dax Shepard, Saxomophone, what's Hax or?

01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:25.120
Hax.

01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:27.200
And AXS, AXS.

01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:29.280
And AXS Body Spray is our sponsor.

01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:31.280
I have no idea what you guys are talking about.

01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:31.760
Don't worry about it.

01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:32.240
It's gibberish.

01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:35.840
I want to thank John Roderick and the Longwinners for using the theme song Into Departure off

01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:37.120
the album Putting the Days to Bed.

01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:43.120
They're just such a great band, and we are honored that we get to use that song because

01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:43.600
it's good.

01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:45.440
It gets me so hyphy every week.

01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:46.640
Yeah, gets you pumped.

01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:48.080
I'd like to thank everybody on Twitter.

01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:52.720
I just kind of threw out if anyone wanted to wish us happy birthday.

01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:55.600
And I was just swamped by people wishing us happy birthday.

01:01:55.600 --> 01:02:01.120
So I'm not going to read all of them, but thanks to Fart Store, Magic Whiskey, Krista

01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:05.600
Whalen, Anaphylaxis, Bursar, all of you guys.

01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:06.480
You're great.

01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:08.960
And everybody else, you guys are awesome.

01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:09.600
Thanks.

01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:11.760
And guys, happy birthday.

01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:12.480
Hey, thanks.

01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:18.000
And thanks to people tweeting about the show, like Cast Iron Brick, Nick Kink, Demiposer.

01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:20.240
Real Chase Fisher.

01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:28.080
JT Homeslice, Alex Betty, Spikes and Beer, Purveyor of the Trash Monkey, Jesse Worker,

01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:29.280
everybody, Karlie Violet.

01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:30.400
You're all sweethearts.

01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:32.160
We love you very much.

01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:34.320
Let's shut this shit down.

01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:35.920
Blow it up, Griffin.

01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:39.840
This Yahoo answer, this final one was sent in by Jason Hellman.

01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:40.480
Thank you, Jason.

01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:47.520
It's by Yahoo Answers user Elacho who asks, can you train a cat to know when it's your

01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:50.400
birthday?

01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:51.840
I'm Justin McElroy.

01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:52.800
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:53.920
I'm Griffin McElroy.

01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:55.360
This has been my brother, my brother, and me.

01:02:55.360 --> 01:02:56.080
Kiss your dad.

01:02:56.080 --> 01:03:18.080
Swear on the lips.
