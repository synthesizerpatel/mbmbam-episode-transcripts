00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.640 --> 00:48.080
Hello and welcome to my brother, my brother, meat advice show for the modern era.

00:48.080 --> 00:52.080
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

00:52.080 --> 00:55.200
I'm your sweet brother, Griffin McElroy.

00:55.200 --> 01:00.960
Welcome to McElroy Master Class. Here in McElroy Master Class,

01:00.960 --> 01:05.200
these three experts will take something that they are the masters of,

01:05.200 --> 01:10.320
and we'll be teaching you about it. I, for example, will be teaching

01:10.320 --> 01:13.600
sourdough bread making. Griffin, what will you be teaching?

01:13.600 --> 01:18.080
I was gonna do sourdough bread making, but I guess I'll switch.

01:18.080 --> 01:19.040
I can switch mine.

01:19.600 --> 01:22.960
No, you said it first, and so I think it's only fair.

01:22.960 --> 01:28.640
Can I do, wouldn't it be fucking hysterical if it was like sourdough bread eating?

01:29.440 --> 01:30.160
That's pretty good.

01:32.560 --> 01:35.120
Stop the podcast, I wanna get off.

01:35.120 --> 01:38.960
I want you to be completely honest with yourself and with our listeners and with us.

01:39.520 --> 01:42.160
Are you a master at eating sourdough?

01:42.160 --> 01:43.440
That's a good point.

01:43.440 --> 01:45.680
Do you know, what are some of the mastery points?

01:46.240 --> 01:48.560
One is like selection is huge.

01:48.560 --> 01:50.160
Don't cut yourself on the crust.

01:50.160 --> 01:51.680
You're gonna cut yourself on the crust.

01:51.680 --> 01:55.040
So I think it's mostly a sort of biological,

01:55.040 --> 01:58.400
bioorganic sort of toughening of the gums,

01:58.960 --> 02:02.160
whether that is through snus and snuff,

02:02.160 --> 02:05.920
or whether that is through a sort of DNA alteration,

02:06.880 --> 02:11.600
radiation, pills, surgery, gums surgery,

02:11.600 --> 02:14.800
to make it tough getting turtle shell put on there.

02:14.800 --> 02:18.560
What about pairing? What about pairings? Knowing the exact pairings.

02:18.560 --> 02:21.920
What does this sourdough bread go with? What kind of moment?

02:21.920 --> 02:23.040
Which ones are aphrodisiacs?

02:23.040 --> 02:26.640
That's a fucking trap, Justin, because a true sourdough master,

02:26.640 --> 02:30.640
the only thing that pairs well with sourdough is even more sourdough, baby.

02:30.640 --> 02:31.360
That is true.

02:31.360 --> 02:36.160
Now, Justin, I assume that for this masterclass, you will be teaching carpentry.

02:37.120 --> 02:40.080
No, I'll do something else. I'll come up with something.

02:40.080 --> 02:41.040
Hold on, let me think about it.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.360
My wallet's pretty organized.

02:44.880 --> 02:46.080
It's slim as hell.

02:46.080 --> 02:47.520
I just got the essentials in there.

02:47.520 --> 02:49.520
I got scans of things that I don't need to swipe.

02:50.320 --> 02:53.680
I have no cash because I'm unmuggable.

02:54.560 --> 02:58.400
Wait, you have scans of things you don't need to swipe?

02:58.400 --> 02:59.760
What are you talking about?

02:59.760 --> 03:02.160
Like my SAG card, right?

03:02.960 --> 03:04.400
I'm not going to carry that around with me.

03:04.400 --> 03:09.280
I don't need to prove that I have SAG credits at any moment in my life,

03:09.280 --> 03:11.440
but I do need the number to be able to pay my dues.

03:11.440 --> 03:14.080
So I scan that. Don't carry it around with me on my wallet.

03:14.080 --> 03:18.720
Oh, I thought you meant like a photocopy of it in your wallet,

03:18.720 --> 03:20.400
and I didn't see how that was better.

03:20.400 --> 03:23.120
I mean, that's actually not a bad tip.

03:23.120 --> 03:25.840
If you don't need to swipe it, but you do want it all you at all times,

03:25.840 --> 03:27.360
get something thinner.

03:27.360 --> 03:30.160
Some sort of translucent parchment perhaps.

03:30.160 --> 03:33.040
We're deep. We're knuckle deep inquire right now.

03:33.040 --> 03:38.480
And so like, I have not needed my wallet in a long, long time.

03:38.480 --> 03:42.000
I put on socks and shoes yesterday to do some yard work.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.080
And your feet screamed in pain.

03:44.080 --> 03:48.960
I realized I had not worn socks in literally three months.

03:48.960 --> 03:51.840
And so that was a challenge for me.

03:51.840 --> 03:55.520
Justin, I know you've been doing some great wood projects

03:55.520 --> 03:58.320
and you did suggest to us literally before we record

03:58.320 --> 04:00.320
that you didn't want to talk about it.

04:00.320 --> 04:01.600
Yeah, I just said I didn't.

04:01.600 --> 04:05.760
I said before we, I was telling you guys about the bench I just finished.

04:05.760 --> 04:08.240
And then I said, I didn't want to talk about it on the book.

04:08.240 --> 04:08.720
And you said you wanted it to be private.

04:08.720 --> 04:12.160
And I wanted to say, but son of a bench, that's good.

04:12.160 --> 04:13.840
And you took that from Travis.

04:13.840 --> 04:16.880
And I'm curious why you're ashamed of this incredible bench.

04:16.880 --> 04:18.240
It's not that I'm ashamed.

04:18.240 --> 04:20.320
I just want something for me.

04:20.320 --> 04:22.080
And I think that should be okay.

04:22.080 --> 04:27.840
I don't have to share every aspect of my life with the people.

04:27.840 --> 04:30.160
I can have a little something for me.

04:30.160 --> 04:31.840
I don't want to talk about woodwork.

04:31.840 --> 04:37.600
Like I don't want to, first, I've just begun learning the craft.

04:37.600 --> 04:41.840
So I don't want to be treated like some sort of expert in it

04:41.840 --> 04:43.440
and say something silly.

04:43.440 --> 04:48.000
But also, if I talk about anything on earth enough,

04:48.000 --> 04:50.240
I'll accidentally start a podcast about it.

04:50.240 --> 04:51.200
That's true.

04:51.200 --> 04:52.320
I don't want to do that.

04:53.120 --> 04:56.400
Maybe you should start another masterclass, Justin, about baking.

04:56.400 --> 04:59.760
Because I think you're serving up a big tasty slice of humble pie right now.

04:59.760 --> 05:01.120
My friend, look at this bench.

05:01.120 --> 05:02.000
This is the bench.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.800
This is the bench of a master carpenter.

05:04.800 --> 05:07.840
This is the kind of bench that Christ would make.

05:08.880 --> 05:09.760
It's just a simple-

05:09.760 --> 05:10.720
Griffin, I'm sorry.

05:10.720 --> 05:13.360
Nowhere in the Bible to say that Jesus was a master carpenter.

05:13.360 --> 05:14.800
He might have been very bad at it.

05:14.800 --> 05:16.320
He may have been just okay, but he-

05:16.320 --> 05:18.640
If he was that great at it, he probably would have stuck with it.

05:18.640 --> 05:20.560
That's what I was saying.

05:20.560 --> 05:24.080
Anyway, Justin, what is your class going to be?

05:24.080 --> 05:26.000
Because it can't be the thing you said about the wallet,

05:26.000 --> 05:26.960
because that's not anything.

05:26.960 --> 05:34.160
I guess I eat a lot of beans still.

05:34.880 --> 05:36.480
Kind of different bean preps.

05:36.480 --> 05:36.960
Dang it.

05:36.960 --> 05:41.520
We did establish a super precedent that we can just talk about eating stuff good.

05:41.520 --> 05:41.840
Shit.

05:41.840 --> 05:42.800
Can I go back to that?

05:42.800 --> 05:45.280
Because I can eat a lot of M&Ms in one sitting.

05:45.280 --> 05:45.760
No, Travis, you've already done-

05:45.760 --> 05:47.520
Bean cookery, listen to this.

05:47.520 --> 05:48.960
I got lesson one, okay?

05:48.960 --> 05:50.160
You're booting it up.

05:50.160 --> 05:50.720
Hello, I'm sitting behind the table.

05:50.720 --> 05:52.480
Hold on, booting it up?

05:52.480 --> 05:54.800
Is it on fucking floppy disk?

05:54.800 --> 05:58.320
Yeah, you have to preload all of them into your Commodore 64 and then run them.

05:59.440 --> 06:01.200
Hi, it's me, Justin McElroy.

06:01.200 --> 06:02.800
If you get a cup of red lentils

06:02.800 --> 06:05.520
and then soak them in two cups of water overnight with some salt

06:05.520 --> 06:08.160
and then blend them in a blender and make a dough,

06:08.160 --> 06:11.040
and then you can make a tortilla out of red lentils,

06:11.040 --> 06:12.560
that's all lentil tortillas.

06:12.560 --> 06:13.760
It's delicious.

06:13.760 --> 06:14.480
Should you, though?

06:16.160 --> 06:17.360
Is it better that way?

06:17.360 --> 06:20.240
You never stop to ask, should I do this?

06:20.240 --> 06:23.040
I mean, it's better than a lot of different ways you can eat lentils.

06:23.040 --> 06:23.520
Sure.

06:23.520 --> 06:24.080
That's fair.

06:24.080 --> 06:25.200
Okay, sure.

06:25.200 --> 06:28.640
There's many more unpleasant ways to eat lentils.

06:28.640 --> 06:30.640
Here is a brief summation of those.

06:30.640 --> 06:31.040
Yeah.

06:31.040 --> 06:34.640
Candied, like sunflowers, just raw.

06:36.240 --> 06:37.840
Chewing your teeth down to nubs.

06:37.840 --> 06:38.320
Juice.

06:38.320 --> 06:40.480
Trying to enjoy raw cauliflower.

06:40.480 --> 06:41.040
J-Dog.

06:41.040 --> 06:42.560
Raw lentils, yes.

06:42.560 --> 06:46.480
You do, you did twice there, say, eat sunflowers.

06:46.480 --> 06:47.360
Are you talking about the seeds

06:47.360 --> 06:51.200
or have you just been just sort of walking up to these bastards in the field

06:51.200 --> 06:54.240
and just opening your mouth and running into them?

06:54.240 --> 07:00.240
I wouldn't know the plant that makes lentils if it was my uncle.

07:00.240 --> 07:02.960
I would not be able to identify this plant.

07:02.960 --> 07:04.480
I know they come in a bag.

07:04.480 --> 07:07.280
And fun fact about lentils.

07:07.280 --> 07:09.120
Ooh, the one?

07:09.120 --> 07:11.040
Here's like a bonus.

07:11.040 --> 07:13.440
If you click down at the bottom, there's a hidden pixel.

07:13.440 --> 07:15.520
And if you click on it, you get a bonus lesson.

07:16.720 --> 07:19.200
If you read and you don't wash lentils,

07:19.200 --> 07:25.680
apparently, in every bag of lentils, there's usually like a couple of pebbles.

07:25.680 --> 07:29.280
Just to keep it fucking fresh and fun.

07:29.280 --> 07:32.720
There's usually just like a couple of small pebbles.

07:32.720 --> 07:35.840
And people say like, now make sure you wash these thoroughly

07:35.840 --> 07:37.920
because there's probably some fucking pebbles in there.

07:37.920 --> 07:43.360
As though that is a standard for any other food that we consume that is acceptable.

07:43.360 --> 07:46.640
It's like lentils DRM that they put in there

07:46.640 --> 07:49.280
to make sure you legally purchased these lentils.

07:49.280 --> 07:52.480
How about just don't do that?

07:52.480 --> 07:53.920
How about just get them out?

07:53.920 --> 07:54.960
What do you want, Justin?

07:54.960 --> 07:59.280
Someone to go through your lentils before they're in the bag and get the pebbles out?

07:59.280 --> 08:00.800
Then what would you do?

08:00.800 --> 08:03.440
One thing that's part of your responsibility with these lentils

08:03.440 --> 08:05.520
is to make sure you get all the pebbles out of it.

08:05.520 --> 08:06.880
It doesn't make any sense.

08:06.880 --> 08:07.680
I don't want to.

08:07.680 --> 08:08.800
Those are the prize.

08:08.800 --> 08:11.200
Like a little toy in the cereal.

08:12.240 --> 08:14.000
No, I know that doesn't track.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.520
It doesn't work like that.

08:15.520 --> 08:17.440
Should we do questions?

08:17.440 --> 08:18.400
Yes, I would love that.

08:18.400 --> 08:20.320
I have a fun new game.

08:20.320 --> 08:20.960
Oh, good.

08:20.960 --> 08:22.560
Oh, this is good.

08:22.560 --> 08:23.120
Is it good?

08:23.120 --> 08:23.920
Oh, it's good.

08:23.920 --> 08:24.560
You'll like this.

08:24.560 --> 08:30.400
This is actually, the idea was given to me by Moment of Magic Pod,

08:30.400 --> 08:32.560
which you should check out.

08:32.560 --> 08:34.240
Do you mean you stole it from them?

08:34.240 --> 08:35.520
No, they tweeted it at me.

08:36.320 --> 08:36.800
Okay.

08:36.800 --> 08:38.640
I thought it was a great idea.

08:38.640 --> 08:38.960
Okay.

08:39.600 --> 08:41.840
And so I got a couple different things here first.

08:42.400 --> 08:44.080
And I think Griffin, you might get this.

08:44.080 --> 08:45.040
That's a hint.

08:45.040 --> 08:46.880
Wait, is this another fucking quiz show?

08:46.880 --> 08:48.960
Because you can't just say it's a different game

08:48.960 --> 08:50.000
if it's play along at home.

08:50.000 --> 08:50.960
No, this is a different game.

08:50.960 --> 08:51.600
This is not-

08:51.600 --> 08:53.760
Okay, so this is a quiz show where if you're listening at home

08:53.760 --> 08:55.600
and you try to fucking answer this,

08:55.600 --> 08:57.120
you have to delete the podcast

08:57.120 --> 08:58.800
because you're not allowed to play at home.

08:58.800 --> 09:00.400
I mean, listen, there are questions.

09:02.400 --> 09:04.080
Then this is play along at home.

09:04.080 --> 09:06.240
What's the difference between this and play along at home?

09:06.240 --> 09:08.080
Hey, Griffin, can I talk to you over here for a second?

09:08.080 --> 09:08.720
Yeah, sure.

09:09.360 --> 09:11.120
How come every time I bring a game,

09:11.120 --> 09:12.560
you just assume it's going to be bad?

09:13.520 --> 09:14.720
Good question.

09:14.720 --> 09:17.040
That's the first question of the quiz.

09:17.040 --> 09:18.240
Okay, listen.

09:18.240 --> 09:19.840
I'm not saying that because you don't even know.

09:19.840 --> 09:21.680
Hey, Griffin, we're still over here.

09:21.680 --> 09:24.400
You haven't even heard what the quiz is based on yet.

09:24.400 --> 09:25.600
Okay, but it's a fucking...

09:25.600 --> 09:28.240
If Alec Trebek showed up to the set of Jeopardy

09:28.240 --> 09:29.600
and was like, what up, everybody?

09:29.600 --> 09:31.680
I got a bunch of cool questions for you all

09:31.680 --> 09:34.240
in my new game, Quisms,

09:34.240 --> 09:36.320
and you feel like, what?

09:36.320 --> 09:37.760
Yeah, this game's called Quisms.

09:37.760 --> 09:39.280
I'm going to ask you answers

09:39.280 --> 09:41.280
and you have to give me the forms of the questions.

09:41.280 --> 09:44.320
And people will be like, bud, that's Jeopardy.

09:44.320 --> 09:46.640
You can't just say this is a different,

09:46.640 --> 09:49.440
welcome to my new game, Wheel of Letters.

09:49.440 --> 09:50.960
Do you mean Wheel of Fortune?

09:50.960 --> 09:53.200
It's similar in a lot of ways.

09:53.920 --> 09:54.880
Hey, Griffin?

09:54.880 --> 09:57.360
Yeah, fucking, okay, go.

09:57.360 --> 09:58.720
You haven't even heard what it's about.

09:58.720 --> 09:59.840
Okay, let's hear it.

09:59.840 --> 10:03.040
We're going to talk about Cameo, the service Cameo.

10:03.040 --> 10:03.360
Okay.

10:03.920 --> 10:05.920
Now, let me start off the bat right here.

10:05.920 --> 10:08.480
If you don't know what it is, Cameo is a really fun service.

10:08.480 --> 10:09.840
This is not a paid advertisement.

10:09.840 --> 10:12.000
It's very fun where you go

10:12.000 --> 10:15.360
and you pay celebrities different amounts of money

10:15.360 --> 10:18.400
to say a birthday wish or something like that.

10:19.280 --> 10:20.960
Happy anniversary message, something like that.

10:20.960 --> 10:23.760
You can get Richard Karn to flip off your principle.

10:23.760 --> 10:24.320
Right.

10:24.320 --> 10:28.400
I tried to get Richard Karn to do a message

10:28.400 --> 10:30.160
for our 500th episode.

10:30.160 --> 10:32.320
He said, and I just got a message back

10:32.320 --> 10:35.040
and I was like, sorry, don't do paid ads.

10:35.840 --> 10:37.280
Smiley face emoji.

10:37.280 --> 10:39.280
And I was like, that sucks.

10:39.280 --> 10:44.240
But I did also just get a free email from Richard Karn.

10:44.240 --> 10:44.480
Nice.

10:44.480 --> 10:45.200
Fucking cool.

10:46.480 --> 10:48.800
I will be talking about Richard Karn in this segment.

10:48.800 --> 10:50.000
Oh, fantastic, fantastic.

10:51.440 --> 10:52.880
He seems nice as hell, by the way.

10:52.880 --> 10:55.280
Yeah, we have a lot of friends on Cameo,

10:55.280 --> 10:59.360
including Matt Doyle to go buy a Cameo for Matt Doyle,

10:59.360 --> 11:01.440
support some actors and performers

11:02.000 --> 11:03.280
during these off work times.

11:04.000 --> 11:07.440
So, Lance Bass is on there.

11:07.440 --> 11:08.160
Sure.

11:08.160 --> 11:12.080
I'm going to read his bio

11:13.040 --> 11:14.960
and you're going to try to guess the amount

11:15.600 --> 11:17.680
to get Cameo from Lance Bass.

11:17.680 --> 11:18.640
Okay, this is a good game.

11:18.640 --> 11:19.840
I've turned around on it.

11:19.840 --> 11:21.520
Okay, now let's start here.

11:21.520 --> 11:22.880
Kudos to Lance Bass.

11:22.880 --> 11:26.160
Proceed from Lance's cameos are donated to charity.

11:26.800 --> 11:27.120
Cool.

11:28.400 --> 11:29.600
Now this is his bio.

11:29.600 --> 11:34.240
Insinker, host of At The Daily Popcast,

11:34.240 --> 11:38.800
foodie, filmmaker, OG Sephiroth.

11:39.600 --> 11:40.800
Whoa, hold on, what?

11:42.400 --> 11:44.640
The original Sephiroth was Lance Bass?

11:44.640 --> 11:45.440
Yeah, dude.

11:45.440 --> 11:46.960
I had to look that up.

11:46.960 --> 11:49.280
He did the voice of Sephiroth in Kingdom Hearts.

11:49.280 --> 11:50.000
Oh, okay.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.160
Well, okay, I mean, that's fucking wild.

11:52.160 --> 11:55.040
Not quite as wild as him being, you know,

11:55.040 --> 11:57.360
fucking one-winged angel destroyer of worlds.

11:57.360 --> 12:00.400
I guess it makes more sense that he did a voice of him.

12:00.400 --> 12:04.720
And it does make it seem like he originated the concept.

12:04.720 --> 12:06.720
I was Sephiroth and they based it off me.

12:07.440 --> 12:10.080
Beloved torso stabber, Sephiroth, me.

12:10.720 --> 12:15.200
Frosted tips survivor, an animal rescuer, Lance Bass.

12:15.200 --> 12:16.240
Can I say something?

12:16.240 --> 12:17.440
I'm gonna say something about Lance Bass

12:17.440 --> 12:19.200
before we move on to Lance Bass.

12:19.200 --> 12:26.480
Lance Bass in 2002 wanted to join a Russian mission

12:26.480 --> 12:28.880
to the ISS, to the International Space Station,

12:28.880 --> 12:31.440
and became certified by both NASA

12:31.440 --> 12:33.040
and the Russian space program

12:33.040 --> 12:35.680
after several months of cosmonaut training.

12:35.680 --> 12:36.160
Cool.

12:36.160 --> 12:38.240
Do you want to know the rest of that that I really enjoy?

12:38.800 --> 12:39.520
What's that?

12:39.520 --> 12:41.760
He, at the last minute, was not able to go,

12:41.760 --> 12:45.840
but they calibrated everything for his weight.

12:46.720 --> 12:49.920
So they had to put a barrel full of stuff

12:49.920 --> 12:53.440
equal to Lance Bass' weight in the shuttle.

12:53.440 --> 12:57.200
What, what, holy shit.

12:57.200 --> 12:58.320
How much, what?

12:58.320 --> 12:59.280
Okay, fuck this.

12:59.280 --> 13:00.640
I don't care about how much it takes to,

13:00.640 --> 13:02.240
how much it costs to get a cameo from him.

13:02.240 --> 13:04.880
I want to know how much it costs to get the Lance Bass barrel

13:04.880 --> 13:06.560
that I can just kind of put in my living room.

13:06.560 --> 13:08.560
That is the, oh, what's with that fucking barrel?

13:08.560 --> 13:10.400
It has nothing to do with anything else in the room.

13:10.400 --> 13:11.280
Well, let me tell you.

13:11.280 --> 13:13.360
Do you want to know how much Lance Bass weighs?

13:13.360 --> 13:14.160
The barrel.

13:14.160 --> 13:15.200
He lays a barrel with his face.

13:15.200 --> 13:17.200
Can I keep talking about Lance Bass, please?

13:17.200 --> 13:17.920
Yeah.

13:17.920 --> 13:21.200
Okay, during his cosmonaut training,

13:21.200 --> 13:23.360
he had to get a thorough physical

13:23.360 --> 13:26.000
and it was discovered that he had a cardiac arrhythmia

13:26.000 --> 13:27.760
that he had to undergo surgery for

13:27.760 --> 13:29.200
and it saved his life.

13:29.200 --> 13:32.080
His desire to be, he would not have become discovered

13:32.080 --> 13:34.480
had he not gone into cosmonaut training.

13:34.480 --> 13:36.160
Absolutely baffling.

13:36.160 --> 13:37.600
My man, Lance Bass, by the way,

13:37.600 --> 13:39.760
if I could just keep talking about Lance Bass for a second,

13:39.760 --> 13:42.720
has retained fucking fluent Russian

13:42.720 --> 13:45.680
that he learned as part of his cosmonaut training.

13:45.680 --> 13:47.200
Are you kidding me?

13:47.200 --> 13:48.160
50 dollars.

13:48.160 --> 13:51.120
Early, early cosmonaut training saves lives.

13:51.120 --> 13:52.160
This is what I'm saying.

13:52.160 --> 13:53.760
Yes, yes, absolutely.

13:54.320 --> 13:57.200
What an absolute, this guy rules.

13:57.200 --> 13:58.240
Kicks ass.

13:58.240 --> 14:01.360
But how much money to get him to flip off your principal?

14:01.360 --> 14:02.400
Whatever it is, it's too low.

14:03.200 --> 14:06.240
I'm going to say 200 dollars.

14:06.240 --> 14:08.480
I don't even know if it goes up that high for cameo,

14:08.480 --> 14:10.400
but I'm gonna say 200 dollars.

14:11.440 --> 14:11.940
Justin?

14:13.120 --> 14:14.960
For Lance Bass, I'm gonna say,

14:14.960 --> 14:17.680
I feel like Griffin's in the neighborhood,

14:18.560 --> 14:23.360
but I'm gonna go with 250 actually.

14:23.360 --> 14:25.920
It is 250 on the dot.

14:25.920 --> 14:28.960
And worth every penny.

14:28.960 --> 14:30.640
Worth every penny.

14:31.920 --> 14:33.760
Wait, did you say I got it right?

14:33.760 --> 14:35.520
Or did you say 250?

14:35.520 --> 14:36.240
It was 250?

14:36.240 --> 14:36.880
Yeah, you got it.

14:40.080 --> 14:40.480
Okay.

14:40.480 --> 14:41.040
That money.

14:41.040 --> 14:41.540
Oh.

14:43.360 --> 14:44.400
Have a combo.

14:44.400 --> 14:46.080
Yeah, I haven't used that one in a while.

14:46.080 --> 14:47.840
Okay, now, next.

14:48.800 --> 14:50.240
Mark McGrath.

14:51.040 --> 14:51.920
Oh, man.

14:51.920 --> 14:53.920
Now, he had a fun cameo

14:53.920 --> 14:56.320
where he broke up with somebody

14:56.960 --> 15:00.240
but wished them well on their finals,

15:00.960 --> 15:02.480
on their doctorate, I believe.

15:02.480 --> 15:02.980
Wait.

15:03.840 --> 15:05.120
He broke up with someone's,

15:06.240 --> 15:07.280
a young lady, I believe,

15:08.240 --> 15:13.040
entreated him to dump her boyfriend on cameo

15:13.040 --> 15:15.200
and Mark McGrath obliged.

15:15.760 --> 15:17.920
While kind of throwing shade at her

15:17.920 --> 15:20.240
because he's in the middle of a very tense time in his life.

15:20.240 --> 15:23.600
But Mark McGrath recorded a very lovely message to this person

15:23.600 --> 15:24.640
and then dumped them.

15:24.640 --> 15:26.240
Now, that might explain,

15:26.240 --> 15:30.800
I've pulled two reviews here from Mark's cameos.

15:30.800 --> 15:32.160
And this first one is,

15:32.160 --> 15:34.960
unreal how thoughtful and personal this is.

15:34.960 --> 15:36.560
Thank you so much, brother.

15:36.560 --> 15:38.800
I got a little teary eyed watching this.

15:38.800 --> 15:41.360
Not gonna lie, you're the real one.

15:41.360 --> 15:42.400
He's the real one.

15:43.200 --> 15:44.400
You're the real one.

15:44.400 --> 15:46.480
Now, that probably is some kind of fun turn of phrase

15:46.480 --> 15:47.600
but it could also be like,

15:47.600 --> 15:49.120
you're not an impersonator.

15:49.120 --> 15:52.640
You are the real Mark McGrath.

15:52.640 --> 15:54.320
This is the Mark McGrath you crave.

15:54.320 --> 15:59.120
Do you remember when Mark McGrath went ballistic on a child

15:59.120 --> 16:01.840
because during a paparazzi photo sesh,

16:01.840 --> 16:03.920
the child yelled sugar gay at him.

16:03.920 --> 16:05.600
I think about it all the time.

16:05.600 --> 16:12.160
He went fucking ballistic and went to fight the child,

16:12.160 --> 16:12.960
which is bad.

16:12.960 --> 16:14.640
It's so bad on every level.

16:14.640 --> 16:15.600
But I guess my question is,

16:15.600 --> 16:19.520
did he charge him for the cameo-

16:19.520 --> 16:20.720
In his life story.

16:20.720 --> 16:22.880
In his life story of being the kid

16:22.880 --> 16:25.680
that Mark McGrath said he was gonna beat his ass up

16:25.680 --> 16:26.960
because he said sugar gay.

16:29.760 --> 16:32.240
And second quick review here.

16:32.240 --> 16:35.600
My sister Shelly and her family totally loved this video.

16:35.600 --> 16:38.960
Mark went above and beyond with a fantastic performance

16:38.960 --> 16:40.720
and an epic Elvis ending.

16:40.720 --> 16:46.640
Mark also pronounces Hawaiian like a local.

16:46.640 --> 16:47.280
So cool.

16:48.160 --> 16:48.960
Cool beans, man.

16:50.720 --> 16:53.440
Yeah, I figured the lead singer Sugar Ray's done his time

16:53.440 --> 16:54.480
in the islands.

16:54.480 --> 16:55.120
No question.

16:55.760 --> 16:57.280
And what is an Elvis ending?

16:57.280 --> 16:57.680
Got me.

16:58.640 --> 16:59.200
Don't know.

16:59.200 --> 17:00.080
Didn't do the research.

17:00.080 --> 17:00.800
Didn't find out.

17:00.800 --> 17:02.960
No, ate a cool sandwich, I bet.

17:05.040 --> 17:06.240
Justin, you wanna do the honors first

17:06.240 --> 17:07.200
and see one last round?

17:07.200 --> 17:08.480
Yeah, you know what?

17:08.480 --> 17:10.640
I'm gonna go for Mark McGrath.

17:10.640 --> 17:12.160
I think you're gonna pay.

17:12.160 --> 17:13.120
It's a premium.

17:13.120 --> 17:15.440
I feel like his star is just a little bit higher

17:16.320 --> 17:18.240
than Lance Bass, weirdly.

17:18.240 --> 17:22.000
Cause he's got like a show on Sirius every weekend

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
and he's staying busy, staying in the news.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.480
I bet he jacked up his rates after he went a little viral

17:26.480 --> 17:27.680
with the breakup.

17:27.680 --> 17:30.800
I'm gonna set him right at $300.

17:31.520 --> 17:32.240
Okay, Griffin.

17:32.240 --> 17:35.120
That is fucking poppycock.

17:35.120 --> 17:36.800
Griffin, you're pretty far away from the microphone.

17:36.800 --> 17:38.480
I know, it's because I was leaning back because

17:38.480 --> 17:41.360
of the fucking ridiculousness of Justin's offer.

17:42.800 --> 17:46.240
He doesn't even have cosmonaut training.

17:48.240 --> 17:51.760
I'm gonna say, if it's anything more than $100,

17:51.760 --> 17:52.880
I will eat my shoes.

17:53.520 --> 17:55.280
It is $99.

17:55.280 --> 17:56.560
I'm giving that to Griffin.

17:56.560 --> 17:58.880
Wow, Griffin, amazing.

17:58.880 --> 17:59.280
Thank you.

18:00.080 --> 18:01.840
Very close, I'm very impressed.

18:01.840 --> 18:03.680
We're all tied up, one and one.

18:03.680 --> 18:06.960
Now, for this last, this is a head-to-head competition,

18:06.960 --> 18:07.760
this last one.

18:07.760 --> 18:08.240
Okay.

18:08.240 --> 18:11.040
And this is direct from, once again, I'm gonna give credit

18:11.040 --> 18:12.960
to you at Magic Moment Pod.

18:13.760 --> 18:15.200
Here it is, are you ready?

18:15.200 --> 18:15.760
Yes.

18:15.760 --> 18:20.240
Richard Karn and Tom Arnold are both on Cameo.

18:20.800 --> 18:22.960
I'm calling this category Karn-old.

18:24.560 --> 18:25.360
Wish you wouldn't.

18:25.360 --> 18:28.480
I want you guys to give me who charges more,

18:29.120 --> 18:31.680
Richard Karn or Tom Arnold,

18:31.680 --> 18:35.760
and for the deciding factor, if you can get closest

18:35.760 --> 18:38.720
to the price of your choice, you will win.

18:38.720 --> 18:39.040
Wow.

18:39.040 --> 18:40.800
Now, let me also say what I really enjoy,

18:40.800 --> 18:42.400
because we were on Young Father's Day,

18:42.400 --> 18:45.920
both of these actors, Richard Karn and Tom Arnold,

18:45.920 --> 18:49.760
had the hashtag, a gift for all dads.

18:50.400 --> 18:51.920
A gift for every dad.

18:51.920 --> 18:54.240
A gift for all dads.

18:54.240 --> 18:58.320
What dad wouldn't be excited to receive a Cameo

18:58.320 --> 19:00.160
from either of these actors?

19:00.160 --> 19:02.480
A gift for all dads.

19:02.480 --> 19:04.000
I mean, I'd be excited for one of them,

19:04.000 --> 19:06.560
but if I got the other one, I'd be fucking pissed

19:06.560 --> 19:08.400
and they know which one it is.

19:08.400 --> 19:09.040
Oh boy.

19:09.040 --> 19:10.080
And that's all I'm gonna fucking say.

19:10.080 --> 19:11.200
A gift for all dads.

19:11.200 --> 19:13.040
A gift for all dads.

19:14.160 --> 19:18.080
Tom Arnold is worth more money than Richard Karn,

19:18.080 --> 19:19.680
in general, so I'm gonna give-

19:19.680 --> 19:20.640
He doesn't know that?

19:20.640 --> 19:21.200
Yeah.

19:22.000 --> 19:27.200
I mean, I have a whole rubric that I use to judge famous people

19:27.200 --> 19:28.400
for how much money that they're worth,

19:28.400 --> 19:31.040
and I think Tom Arnold just comes out on top of Richard Karn.

19:31.040 --> 19:34.640
Rich, boy, but you know I'm there for you,

19:34.640 --> 19:36.720
but Tom Arnold's got you beat in that category.

19:36.720 --> 19:40.880
I mean, I feel like I'm gonna have to go to Tom Arnold as well.

19:40.880 --> 19:41.360
Yes.

19:41.360 --> 19:42.720
Which is not fair.

19:42.720 --> 19:43.760
What's the deciding thing?

19:43.760 --> 19:45.520
How much Tom Arnold?

19:45.520 --> 19:46.880
Yeah, how much for Tom Arnold?

19:47.920 --> 19:49.200
How much to get a Tom Arnold?

19:49.200 --> 19:49.440
Yeah.

19:49.440 --> 19:51.760
I feel like Tom Arnold is gonna cost you.

19:51.760 --> 19:57.120
Again, I feel like Tom Arnold is gonna run you $225.

19:57.120 --> 20:01.280
And I feel like Richard Karn is $75.

20:02.400 --> 20:03.040
No, you know what?

20:03.040 --> 20:06.480
Richard Karn's $75, Tom Arnold, $150.

20:06.480 --> 20:07.280
That is it.

20:07.280 --> 20:08.560
I'm gonna say twice as much.

20:08.560 --> 20:10.880
It's Richard Karn who I bet costs $75.

20:10.880 --> 20:16.080
I know I entreated him to record a greeting for our show.

20:16.080 --> 20:17.120
I do not remember the cost.

20:17.120 --> 20:18.640
I didn't pay that close attention to it.

20:18.640 --> 20:20.320
And folks, that's privilege.

20:20.320 --> 20:21.520
I'm gonna go ahead and just say it.

20:22.880 --> 20:24.000
I'll do anything for the show.

20:24.000 --> 20:24.640
Now, Griffin.

20:25.200 --> 20:25.440
Yeah.

20:25.440 --> 20:29.120
Yeah, I was gonna say $150 also for Tom Arnold,

20:29.120 --> 20:30.880
but Justin's swooped in there.

20:30.880 --> 20:32.000
How much for Richard Karn?

20:32.640 --> 20:34.240
How much for Richard Karn?

20:34.240 --> 20:34.740
Yeah.

20:36.320 --> 20:39.120
You said $75 for Richard Karn, $150 for Tom Arnold?

20:39.120 --> 20:40.240
That is what I said.

20:40.240 --> 20:42.640
God, that's so fucking good, Juice.

20:42.640 --> 20:44.160
It feels right, doesn't it?

20:44.160 --> 20:45.120
It's got a very good mouthfeel.

20:45.120 --> 20:46.640
I'm gonna say $76.

20:46.640 --> 20:48.560
$75 for Richard Karn.

20:48.560 --> 20:52.720
$76 for Richard Karn, $149 for Tom Arnold.

20:52.720 --> 20:53.760
I'm gonna call it a tie,

20:53.760 --> 20:55.520
because none of that cheap bullshit, Griffin.

20:56.720 --> 20:57.600
You can't fucking...

20:57.600 --> 20:59.440
Okay, that's fucking bullshit.

20:59.440 --> 21:02.080
You can't just make up the rules of this incredible game

21:02.080 --> 21:02.960
as we go along.

21:03.680 --> 21:06.640
$76 for Richard Karn, $149 for Tom Arnold.

21:06.640 --> 21:07.280
Okay, then shit.

21:07.280 --> 21:08.640
I gotta give it to Griffin.

21:08.640 --> 21:10.160
Richard Karn, $80.

21:10.160 --> 21:12.000
Tom Arnold, $125.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.520
A gift for all dads.

21:13.520 --> 21:14.880
A gift for all dads.

21:15.440 --> 21:16.640
Hey, for $200.

21:17.200 --> 21:18.240
It's a combo.

21:18.800 --> 21:20.240
Get them talking to each other.

21:20.240 --> 21:23.760
Might can fucking read a scene from Waiting for Godot together.

21:23.760 --> 21:26.000
You get that Carnold accent.

21:26.000 --> 21:29.280
Might, your dad's gonna love this recreation of True West,

21:29.280 --> 21:32.320
starring Richard Karn and Tom Arnold

21:32.320 --> 21:34.800
alternating roles in each caveat.

21:34.800 --> 21:35.300
All right.

21:36.160 --> 21:37.840
That was a good game, Travis.

21:37.840 --> 21:38.640
You've done it.

21:38.640 --> 21:40.400
You've fucking cracked the code.

21:40.400 --> 21:41.440
I mean, it wasn't your idea,

21:41.440 --> 21:43.760
but you fucking executed it beautifully.

21:43.760 --> 21:44.880
Thank you very much.

21:44.880 --> 21:47.120
All I wanna talk about anymore is Lance Bass.

21:47.120 --> 21:48.800
Lance, if you're listening, bud, please.

21:48.800 --> 21:49.280
Hit us up.

21:49.280 --> 21:52.640
Reach out to, you know, we have a very good track record.

21:52.640 --> 21:54.080
Lance, if you would love to come on the show

21:54.080 --> 21:56.560
and just talk, to be a guest, I would love to have you.

21:56.560 --> 21:57.360
It's fun.

21:57.360 --> 21:58.880
I will go on rather to saying,

21:58.880 --> 22:01.120
I think any NSYNC member,

22:02.160 --> 22:03.920
except Justin Timberlake.

22:03.920 --> 22:04.480
Yeah.

22:04.480 --> 22:05.840
I don't want, we've made it clear,

22:05.840 --> 22:06.880
we don't want JT on the show,

22:06.880 --> 22:08.000
but I would love to have Lance on here.

22:08.000 --> 22:09.520
If we could get J.C. Chazee,

22:10.080 --> 22:11.520
oh boy, that would be a life goal.

22:11.520 --> 22:13.760
I'm really, can we just stay focused

22:13.760 --> 22:15.600
for fucking once in our careers?

22:15.600 --> 22:17.520
I just want Lance Bass as a guest spurt.

22:17.520 --> 22:17.840
Okay.

22:17.840 --> 22:19.200
I think that would be fantastic.

22:19.200 --> 22:21.120
All right, let's visualize it.

22:21.120 --> 22:22.560
Wait, we could combo it together,

22:22.560 --> 22:26.080
chain it together, go Chris Fitzpatrick,

22:26.080 --> 22:29.040
then J.C. Chazee, then Joey Fatone,

22:29.040 --> 22:30.320
to Lance Bass.

22:30.320 --> 22:34.560
Listen, $1,000 will get us four cameos from Lance,

22:34.560 --> 22:35.520
and I think that might be enough

22:35.520 --> 22:37.200
for us to put together a guest spurt segment.

22:37.200 --> 22:38.960
We could just get him saying things

22:38.960 --> 22:40.800
in response to potential questions

22:40.800 --> 22:42.480
and then kind of weave them together.

22:42.480 --> 22:43.280
Edit it together.

22:43.280 --> 22:43.680
Oh, that's not bad.

22:43.680 --> 22:44.880
Listen, everyone, stop.

22:45.680 --> 22:47.120
Stop, it's time.

22:47.120 --> 22:49.680
Oh, wait, speaking of tweeting at people,

22:49.680 --> 22:52.320
I want to thank everyone for tweeting

22:52.320 --> 22:54.400
at WSAZ's Rob Johnson.

22:55.360 --> 22:57.360
There was a lot of tweets to Rob Johnson

22:58.880 --> 23:02.640
for getting our kite out of the tree.

23:02.640 --> 23:04.480
A lot of people tweeted at him to thank him.

23:06.000 --> 23:09.680
Also, I'm just gonna share this very briefly.

23:12.880 --> 23:15.840
Rob Johnson said that we need to hear real music.

23:15.840 --> 23:18.720
Forget Rob Thomas, you need Rob Johnson,

23:18.720 --> 23:22.960
and shared a link to a brief song about Rob Johnson

23:22.960 --> 23:24.800
that I'd love to share with you guys if that's okay.

23:24.800 --> 23:25.600
Oh, boy.

23:25.600 --> 23:27.840
It's just a very brief song about Rob Johnson.

23:27.840 --> 23:31.280
Sure, and then I promise we're gonna start doing questions.

23:31.280 --> 23:32.080
It's gonna be great.

23:32.080 --> 23:33.760
Then the show will begin.

23:33.760 --> 23:34.560
Oh, yes.

23:35.680 --> 23:38.800
This is by Rob Coleman.

23:38.800 --> 23:40.240
It's a song about Rob Johnson,

23:40.240 --> 23:41.840
commissioned by Alan Brown,

23:41.840 --> 23:43.920
and this is how the song goes.

23:43.920 --> 23:46.320
What up, my name is Rob Johnson.

23:46.320 --> 23:48.480
My Huntington fame is Rob Johnson.

23:48.480 --> 23:51.040
Yeah, this whole show should be called Rob Johnson.

23:51.040 --> 23:52.320
So say it out loud.

23:53.280 --> 23:55.600
Stuck in the rain, Rob Johnson.

23:55.600 --> 23:57.760
WSA, Rob Johnson.

23:57.760 --> 24:00.160
See, it's where I'm gonna be, Rob Johnson.

24:00.160 --> 24:02.720
In the Hall of Fame, Rob Johnson.

24:02.720 --> 24:05.280
Six in the morning, what up, it's Rob Johnson.

24:05.280 --> 24:07.360
And now it's midday, Rob Johnson.

24:07.360 --> 24:09.760
Saying hey, Rob Johnson.

24:09.760 --> 24:12.720
Indiana University, Rob Johnson.

24:12.720 --> 24:16.080
Yeah, that's where I win one of it, Rob Johnson.

24:16.080 --> 24:18.560
Just say what you want, but I love it, Rob Johnson.

24:18.560 --> 24:20.960
Don't act like you are above it, Rob Johnson.

24:20.960 --> 24:23.120
No one is ever above, Rob Johnson.

24:24.320 --> 24:26.640
So that's one of my favorite songs about Rob Johnson.

24:26.640 --> 24:27.760
Strong ones that I've heard.

24:28.560 --> 24:30.560
That has no business being that good.

24:30.560 --> 24:32.560
I know, it's way better than I expected it to be

24:32.560 --> 24:33.360
when I clicked the link.

24:33.360 --> 24:35.360
Thank you, WSAZ Rob Johnson.

24:36.880 --> 24:37.600
Appreciate it.

24:37.600 --> 24:38.560
Hope you can figure out

24:38.560 --> 24:41.280
why you were having some signal trouble on June 4th.

24:41.280 --> 24:43.440
Best of luck to you and yours.

24:43.440 --> 24:45.760
My wife and I recently moved into our first house

24:45.760 --> 24:46.720
and it's pretty great,

24:47.280 --> 24:50.000
but our elderly next door neighbor keeps mowing our yard.

24:50.800 --> 24:53.040
It started with him just doing our small front yard,

24:53.040 --> 24:53.680
which makes sense.

24:54.320 --> 24:55.920
Since it would almost be more work

24:55.920 --> 24:57.600
to mine the borders of our yards.

24:57.600 --> 25:00.560
But recently he's been mowing our backyard as well

25:00.560 --> 25:02.000
and he's not doing a good job.

25:02.560 --> 25:08.080
He cuts corners and skips patches

25:08.080 --> 25:11.200
that would be tricky for his writing mode to get into.

25:11.200 --> 25:13.680
And worse yet, my wife and I are working from home

25:13.680 --> 25:15.040
so we have no choice but to watch him

25:15.040 --> 25:16.320
do the whole thing poorly.

25:16.320 --> 25:18.240
Should we ask him to stop or thank him?

25:18.240 --> 25:20.560
That's from Indecisive in Indiana.

25:20.560 --> 25:22.720
I did not expect the twist of someone

25:22.720 --> 25:25.680
who will go through the effort of mowing your backyard

25:25.680 --> 25:27.920
but does not take pride in a job well done.

25:27.920 --> 25:29.200
I did not see that coming.

25:29.200 --> 25:30.400
I don't understand the...

25:32.480 --> 25:35.040
Can you not go out there and fucking polish it off?

25:37.360 --> 25:39.760
Somebody is mowing your lawn for free

25:39.760 --> 25:43.120
and your complaint is that they're cutting corners

25:43.120 --> 25:44.480
when you could just go out there

25:45.040 --> 25:47.360
and knock out those last few corners.

25:47.360 --> 25:48.720
Okay, here's the problem, Griffin.

25:48.720 --> 25:49.920
What is the problem?

25:49.920 --> 25:51.360
There is a factor here.

25:51.360 --> 25:53.360
There is an unknown quantity here,

25:53.360 --> 25:58.240
which is does neighbor guy think he's doing them

25:58.240 --> 26:00.240
a good job service, right?

26:00.240 --> 26:01.360
Because if he's like,

26:01.360 --> 26:04.320
ah, what a good nice thing to do for my neighbors

26:04.320 --> 26:07.680
and then they see you out there cleaning up after them,

26:07.680 --> 26:10.240
that, oh, ow.

26:10.240 --> 26:12.560
Oh, okay, okay, I see what Travis is saying.

26:12.560 --> 26:15.280
Now it's like, oh, it wasn't good enough for you, huh?

26:15.280 --> 26:17.520
I see you out there kind of going over some of my work.

26:17.520 --> 26:18.720
Right, right.

26:18.720 --> 26:21.280
Okay, all right, that's trickier, fair.

26:21.280 --> 26:22.960
But there is also the potential

26:22.960 --> 26:24.800
that this is a passive aggressive thing.

26:24.800 --> 26:27.600
I have neighbors, they're very nice, let me be clear.

26:27.600 --> 26:29.440
But I'm saying I could see where

26:29.440 --> 26:31.520
if I let my lawn go a little bit,

26:31.520 --> 26:33.440
maybe didn't have it mowed,

26:33.440 --> 26:38.440
then they're like, oh, I see that Travis hasn't mowed his lawn.

26:40.400 --> 26:43.600
What a sloppy young man, this millennial.

26:44.240 --> 26:46.720
Probably too busy out there partying

26:46.720 --> 26:49.360
and raving and eating avocado toast.

26:50.400 --> 26:52.000
Sorry, did you say avocado?

26:52.000 --> 26:54.640
Yeah, they're old, they don't know what an avocado is.

26:55.280 --> 26:56.240
They say avocado.

26:57.600 --> 27:00.000
This generational gap just keeps getting worse.

27:00.000 --> 27:02.160
Yeah, and so then they come over

27:02.160 --> 27:05.200
and they mow my lawn and it's a passive aggressive thing.

27:05.200 --> 27:10.200
Right, yeah, you're gonna have to do it at night

27:11.360 --> 27:14.640
with one of those push mowers that doesn't make sounds.

27:14.640 --> 27:16.400
Yeah, stealth mower.

27:16.400 --> 27:17.680
A stealth mowing situation.

27:17.680 --> 27:19.760
Or scissors, scissors are nice and quiet.

27:19.760 --> 27:21.680
Or just rip the shit up so it doesn't grow back.

27:22.240 --> 27:23.200
Why don't people do that?

27:24.160 --> 27:25.520
Yeah, put down some turf.

27:25.520 --> 27:27.920
Put down a little bit of astroturf down there.

27:28.560 --> 27:31.040
And then also if you want to throw the pigskin around,

27:31.040 --> 27:32.960
it's right there ready for you.

27:32.960 --> 27:36.720
A bunch of like black plastic, make it into a slip and slide.

27:36.720 --> 27:40.720
Hole, put some visqueen down,

27:40.720 --> 27:42.560
make a whole backyard slip and slide.

27:42.560 --> 27:44.000
Nobody's done that before.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.600
Dig a pond.

27:45.600 --> 27:48.000
No one thinks about, and this is like,

27:48.000 --> 27:50.640
think about it for a second, dig a pond back there.

27:51.280 --> 27:55.120
All you need for a pond is the absence of dirt and water.

27:55.120 --> 27:57.520
That's right, and the water's gonna come from rain.

27:58.240 --> 27:59.680
Yeah, and now you got a swimming hole.

27:59.680 --> 28:02.720
And then you got a big old swimming hole in the backyard.

28:02.720 --> 28:05.520
And that's fun because then all the neighborhood youth can come

28:05.520 --> 28:09.680
and everyone and neighbors and instead of getting into drugs

28:09.680 --> 28:12.480
and, you know, hard partying or whatever,

28:12.480 --> 28:14.640
everybody can just come down to the swimming hole,

28:14.640 --> 28:17.920
talk about life, a lot about living and a little about love.

28:18.560 --> 28:20.400
You may be overthinking this.

28:20.400 --> 28:21.840
You may be overthinking this a little bit

28:21.840 --> 28:26.400
because if I owned a beautiful, powerful John Deere riding mower,

28:26.400 --> 28:29.680
I'm assuming it's a deer because if it's not, it's not a machine,

28:30.560 --> 28:32.720
is that if I got done mowing my lawn

28:33.280 --> 28:35.840
on my beautiful John Deere riding mower,

28:35.840 --> 28:37.680
I imagine my first thought would be like,

28:37.680 --> 28:40.720
ooh, I would love to cut a little bit more lawn

28:40.720 --> 28:42.480
with this huge, beautiful machine.

28:43.040 --> 28:45.200
I don't think anybody gets done mowing their lawn

28:45.200 --> 28:48.800
in their riding mower and thinks like, that has satisfied me.

28:48.800 --> 28:50.080
I think they probably think like,

28:50.080 --> 28:53.680
oof, oh man, I'm hungry for even more.

28:53.680 --> 28:55.200
So they may just be trying to like,

28:55.200 --> 28:57.120
either satisfy this dark passenger,

28:57.120 --> 29:01.680
like trying to like make their purchase of a riding mower

29:01.680 --> 29:03.440
make a little bit more sense.

29:03.440 --> 29:04.640
That's what it is, yes.

29:04.640 --> 29:06.240
I like that, I like that.

29:06.240 --> 29:08.160
But I do like Griffin that in your mind,

29:08.160 --> 29:11.040
this person is like, well, I already bought the mower

29:11.040 --> 29:13.600
and my yard is only like 20 square feet,

29:13.600 --> 29:15.520
so I need to keep using this somewhere,

29:15.520 --> 29:18.240
but I am not invested in the quality of my job

29:18.240 --> 29:20.160
because it's not my yard.

29:20.160 --> 29:22.480
Yeah, you could set up some traffic cones

29:22.480 --> 29:24.640
that he could like slalom around,

29:24.640 --> 29:26.480
but like position them in a way

29:26.480 --> 29:28.000
that he would make sure that he would get

29:28.000 --> 29:30.960
all those nooks and crannies.

29:30.960 --> 29:32.720
And then he would have more fun with it too.

29:33.520 --> 29:34.960
That would be better for everybody.

29:34.960 --> 29:36.240
Yeah. And you get to watch it.

29:37.360 --> 29:40.560
Yeah, you could also get your own riding lawn mower

29:40.560 --> 29:42.160
and then every time he goes out, be like,

29:42.160 --> 29:43.600
oh shit, he's going, quick, go!

29:43.600 --> 29:45.600
And then you get on your own riding lawn mower

29:45.600 --> 29:48.160
and do your own yard, and you can do like a race with it.

29:48.160 --> 29:49.840
There's lots of cool ways to get to know your neighbor.

29:49.840 --> 29:51.600
Get in, get a lance.

29:51.600 --> 29:52.480
Get a lance.

29:52.480 --> 29:55.280
Yeah, get a lance bass.

29:55.280 --> 29:56.880
No, get a jousting lance bass.

29:58.560 --> 30:01.200
I said, I meant like jousting lance,

30:01.200 --> 30:02.720
that would be fun in riding lawn mowers,

30:02.720 --> 30:04.160
but I think there's something also great

30:04.160 --> 30:06.560
to getting a lance bass to do a cameo

30:06.560 --> 30:09.200
to ask your neighbor to stop fucking up your grass.

30:09.200 --> 30:12.320
Hey, Z Lance says, I'm going to say this in Russian,

30:12.320 --> 30:14.720
please stop fucking up my grass.

30:14.720 --> 30:16.160
Hey, even from space,

30:16.160 --> 30:19.920
I can see you're doing a terrible job mowing the grass.

30:19.920 --> 30:22.320
I brought this barrel full of stuff

30:22.320 --> 30:24.160
that's going to hold down the grass

30:24.160 --> 30:25.920
so it won't grow up anymore.

30:25.920 --> 30:30.640
I found your lack of work ethic heartbreaking

30:30.640 --> 30:31.920
and I can't handle that.

30:31.920 --> 30:33.200
I've had enough problems.

30:33.200 --> 30:36.480
I need you to just stay in your home, please, citizen.

30:36.480 --> 30:38.160
Let me mow the lawn for you.

30:39.600 --> 30:41.600
This is my side business.

30:41.600 --> 30:44.480
I bought a lawn mower and I've been making some extra scratch.

30:44.480 --> 30:45.920
I'm going to build my own rocket.

30:46.640 --> 30:48.640
Griffin, do you have any yahoos saved up this week

30:48.640 --> 30:50.160
that you'd like to share with us?

30:50.160 --> 30:51.200
I'd love that if you do.

30:51.200 --> 30:52.880
I could do a quick one, yeah, sure.

30:54.480 --> 30:56.080
This yahoo is sent in by lots of folks, thanks.

30:56.080 --> 30:57.520
It's an anonymous yahoo answers user

30:57.520 --> 31:03.280
who I'm going to name Jim, wow, asks.

31:04.160 --> 31:06.000
But it's not spelled how it sounds.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
No, no, it's G-Y-M, asks,

31:09.840 --> 31:11.360
why don't we have castles anymore?

31:12.240 --> 31:14.320
We only have regular basic buildings now.

31:14.320 --> 31:16.000
Why did humans stop building castles?

31:16.000 --> 31:18.320
Castles are just as good and sturdy as regular buildings,

31:18.320 --> 31:19.360
except they look better.

31:19.360 --> 31:21.680
So why did humans stop building castles?

31:21.680 --> 31:23.040
I live in America, BTW,

31:23.040 --> 31:25.120
and maybe it's just America that hates castles.

31:25.120 --> 31:26.640
I haven't been to other countries.

31:28.000 --> 31:31.520
There's castles, I mean, I'm talking out of my ass now,

31:31.520 --> 31:37.120
but I would estimate that the castle per square inch ratio

31:37.120 --> 31:42.240
of America is lower than a lot of other sort of territories

31:42.240 --> 31:43.760
across this beautiful globe of ours.

31:43.760 --> 31:47.840
I think I can understand the question

31:47.840 --> 31:50.640
because castles are made out of what?

31:50.640 --> 31:53.440
Rocks and stuff to hold the rocks together.

31:53.440 --> 31:56.000
That's basically it from what I like.

31:56.000 --> 31:57.520
And tapestries.

31:57.520 --> 31:59.280
Tapestries, but I don't even think

31:59.280 --> 32:01.520
they have load-bearing tapestries in castles.

32:01.520 --> 32:03.680
I think, you know, brass tacks,

32:03.680 --> 32:04.880
there are no brass tacks involved.

32:04.880 --> 32:06.800
It's just rocks and stuff to hold the rocks together.

32:06.800 --> 32:09.360
That's every, I've never walked around inside a castle

32:09.360 --> 32:11.360
and been like, hmm, drywall.

32:11.360 --> 32:13.040
It's always rocks and stuff to hold the rocks together.

32:13.040 --> 32:15.120
And there's lots of fucking rocks.

32:15.760 --> 32:18.080
And I imagine lots of ways to get them to stick together.

32:18.080 --> 32:21.600
And so like, I don't understand why, you know,

32:21.600 --> 32:22.480
the housing crisis.

32:22.480 --> 32:25.360
I don't think people stopped building castles

32:25.360 --> 32:27.440
because they ran out of materials, Griffin.

32:27.440 --> 32:29.360
I don't think anyone thought that was it.

32:29.360 --> 32:31.600
Well, no, it was just like somebody invented drywall

32:31.600 --> 32:32.320
and they're like, oh cool,

32:32.320 --> 32:33.600
this is what it has to be from now on.

32:33.600 --> 32:36.240
But like, I guess drywall and wood and stuff is expensive.

32:37.840 --> 32:40.000
But like, there's a shortage of housing,

32:40.000 --> 32:43.200
available housing as a commodity.

32:43.200 --> 32:44.720
And I think that we could just start

32:44.720 --> 32:45.760
slapping some rocks together

32:45.760 --> 32:48.080
and making some pretty fucking cool houses out of it.

32:48.080 --> 32:50.720
And it's not just like, so we could have houses.

32:50.720 --> 32:52.880
We could have fucking cool castle houses in it too,

32:52.880 --> 32:53.440
like in Link Check.

32:53.440 --> 32:55.440
Why do we need, I mean, we don't need,

32:55.440 --> 32:58.560
why do we need a castle is my thing.

32:58.560 --> 33:01.840
Like, if I upset my neighbors,

33:01.840 --> 33:03.760
I don't expect them to try to settle it

33:03.760 --> 33:05.360
with siege weaponry.

33:05.360 --> 33:05.840
Oh, you don't?

33:05.840 --> 33:09.040
I don't expect them to come out with like,

33:09.040 --> 33:12.720
catapults and I was about to say Battista.

33:14.960 --> 33:16.320
What's up, it's me, Dave Battista.

33:16.320 --> 33:17.600
I'm gonna start kicking your castle.

33:17.600 --> 33:18.560
We're gonna see what happens.

33:18.560 --> 33:20.160
Your neighbor paid for a cameo.

33:23.360 --> 33:24.960
It's my new service, Kickio.

33:24.960 --> 33:26.800
I go to your house and kick your castle

33:26.800 --> 33:28.560
until it falls down, Dave Battista.

33:28.560 --> 33:29.760
Yeah, I know, Groot.

33:29.760 --> 33:30.400
What of it?

33:30.400 --> 33:31.040
Kick, kick, kick, kick.

33:31.040 --> 33:40.560
It's just no need for the castle.

33:40.560 --> 33:42.320
There's no need for, you know,

33:44.160 --> 33:47.600
castles were used, a lot of the ruling class

33:48.160 --> 33:50.720
would make them like the boss of the fiefdom, right?

33:50.720 --> 33:53.120
They would leave in a castle and then rule over.

33:53.120 --> 33:55.280
If my neighbors saw me building a castle,

33:55.280 --> 33:57.200
they would probably start to get suspicious.

33:57.760 --> 33:59.200
What is this guy gonna do?

33:59.200 --> 34:02.960
Does this guy have designs on trying to rule over

34:04.080 --> 34:07.280
the region, the new King of Huntington brand?

34:07.280 --> 34:10.240
Every time I have learned anything about a castle,

34:10.240 --> 34:13.520
basically what I've learned is that the timeline breaks down

34:13.520 --> 34:16.640
as castle building is completed

34:17.520 --> 34:20.960
and then like the next day somebody comes

34:21.760 --> 34:24.640
and by some means will leave out,

34:25.680 --> 34:28.080
clears everyone out of that castle

34:28.080 --> 34:29.760
and now that castle is theirs,

34:30.320 --> 34:33.120
repeat for about 500 years.

34:33.760 --> 34:34.560
So haunted.

34:36.080 --> 34:37.760
That would not fly now.

34:37.760 --> 34:39.920
It wouldn't be like you left your house

34:39.920 --> 34:41.200
and then I got in it.

34:41.200 --> 34:43.360
Well, I guess that's your squatter's rights, isn't it?

34:43.360 --> 34:45.040
There's a lot of complicated issues there,

34:45.040 --> 34:46.720
but I think the point remains that like

34:46.720 --> 34:48.640
if you walked into a house and someone told you,

34:48.640 --> 34:49.600
pretty cool house, huh?

34:49.600 --> 34:51.680
Hundreds and hundreds of people have been killed here

34:51.680 --> 34:52.720
to get the house.

34:52.720 --> 34:53.520
Then I would be like,

34:54.080 --> 34:55.520
I don't wanna be in this house anymore.

34:55.520 --> 34:57.360
And yet you walk into a castle or a fortress

34:57.360 --> 34:59.520
and it's like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, cool place.

34:59.520 --> 35:00.720
Like look at all the rocks.

35:00.720 --> 35:01.440
Pillars, love it.

35:01.440 --> 35:02.800
Look at those sconces.

35:02.800 --> 35:04.560
Those are original sconces.

35:04.560 --> 35:06.960
Thousands dead in mini sieges.

35:06.960 --> 35:07.680
Then I would be like,

35:07.680 --> 35:11.360
the ghost, the spectral energy in here is not great.

35:11.360 --> 35:11.920
So I'm gonna-

35:11.920 --> 35:13.040
That is true.

35:13.040 --> 35:14.560
When I was buying a house,

35:14.560 --> 35:15.920
like our realtor wasn't like,

35:15.920 --> 35:17.680
and you see that, that tiny hole near the floor?

35:17.680 --> 35:18.400
Do you know what that's for?

35:18.960 --> 35:19.680
Hot oil.

35:20.240 --> 35:21.440
That's hot oil.

35:21.440 --> 35:22.880
In case somebody tries.

35:22.880 --> 35:24.240
So that's gonna keep them away.

35:25.200 --> 35:26.160
And that hole over there,

35:26.160 --> 35:28.320
that's for shooting arrows out of.

35:28.320 --> 35:29.680
So that's pretty cool, huh?

35:32.240 --> 35:33.680
I rescind the question.

35:33.680 --> 35:36.000
It's a bad question and I think about it.

35:36.000 --> 35:37.280
Do you think that there was somebody

35:37.280 --> 35:38.880
who built a castle,

35:38.880 --> 35:41.520
like after the Age of Castles was done?

35:42.080 --> 35:43.600
And like, as they built the castle,

35:43.600 --> 35:45.040
they finished and they're like,

35:45.040 --> 35:47.440
Todd, no one wants to take this.

35:48.080 --> 35:48.640
And they're like,

35:48.640 --> 35:52.160
oh man, doesn't somebody wanna take my castle?

35:52.160 --> 35:53.920
It's like, no, these things are highly important.

35:53.920 --> 35:57.040
How do you keep this high in the winter

35:57.040 --> 35:58.640
and cold in the summertime?

35:58.640 --> 36:00.240
This is highly impractical.

36:00.240 --> 36:03.040
You need to be in a temperate region for sure.

36:03.040 --> 36:05.360
Do you think the person exists, Travis,

36:05.360 --> 36:07.520
who would spend a bunch of money

36:07.520 --> 36:09.840
building a modern day castle,

36:09.840 --> 36:13.120
who would at any point thereafter

36:13.120 --> 36:14.880
would admit that it was a mistake?

36:15.600 --> 36:18.240
Like fellow cosmonaut Richard Garriott,

36:18.240 --> 36:19.760
creator of the Ultima series,

36:19.760 --> 36:21.600
built a castle here in Austin, Texas

36:21.600 --> 36:23.840
that has all kinds of incredible winding corridors

36:23.840 --> 36:24.880
and secret passages

36:24.880 --> 36:29.200
and did a fucking museum with a Tesla coil

36:29.200 --> 36:33.200
and a bunch of old archaic technology in it.

36:33.200 --> 36:34.800
But you know he probably gets to a point

36:34.800 --> 36:36.080
where he wakes up in the middle of the night

36:36.080 --> 36:37.760
and he does have diarrhea

36:37.760 --> 36:39.040
and he has to go running

36:39.040 --> 36:41.600
and remember which skull goes on which bookshelf

36:41.600 --> 36:44.480
to open up the hard, cold stone staircase

36:44.480 --> 36:45.680
to the one toilet in the house.

36:46.400 --> 36:48.320
But still, even he would not be like,

36:48.320 --> 36:50.720
this was, guys, I blew it.

36:50.720 --> 36:51.360
He's probably gotta keep it.

36:51.360 --> 36:53.440
I just want a studio apartment.

36:53.440 --> 36:55.200
He's probably gotta keep up pretenses.

36:55.200 --> 36:57.040
Known castle-haver Richard Garriott

36:57.040 --> 36:58.720
probably has to continue telling people

36:58.720 --> 37:00.640
how great it is to live in a castle.

37:01.920 --> 37:02.800
That's all I'm saying.

37:03.680 --> 37:05.520
I would like to have a castle.

37:07.200 --> 37:09.120
But I don't know that I would like to live in it.

37:09.120 --> 37:11.280
They don't seem comfortable.

37:11.280 --> 37:12.960
They're all made out of rocks.

37:12.960 --> 37:14.320
What are you gonna fucking do with it?

37:15.440 --> 37:16.240
What would I do with it?

37:16.960 --> 37:18.960
I would let people go through it for tours

37:18.960 --> 37:19.920
and charge them money,

37:19.920 --> 37:22.880
which is what I think people in Europe do

37:22.880 --> 37:24.320
if they own a castle.

37:24.320 --> 37:26.320
Yeah, that's how they make ends meet,

37:26.320 --> 37:28.560
is they have to turn it into a B&B or something.

37:28.560 --> 37:33.600
Yeah, and meanwhile they live above a bar downtown

37:33.600 --> 37:34.640
and they're having a great time.

37:35.360 --> 37:38.720
I'd probably turn it into a fucking cool Airsoft course,

37:38.720 --> 37:40.160
like an Airsoft arena.

37:40.160 --> 37:41.440
That's a good idea.

37:41.440 --> 37:43.120
I'd make it a Magic Quest place.

37:43.120 --> 37:44.800
Oh yeah, that's pretty good.

37:44.800 --> 37:48.960
I would probably make mine like LARP,

37:48.960 --> 37:50.560
like a Dungeons and Dragons LARP.

37:50.560 --> 37:51.520
Like a LARP thing?

37:51.520 --> 37:52.320
Yeah.

37:52.320 --> 37:52.720
Pretty good.

37:52.720 --> 37:53.120
Rent it out.

37:53.120 --> 37:55.600
Maybe make it like a B&B,

37:55.600 --> 37:58.720
but fill it with board games and host.

37:58.720 --> 38:00.000
D&D B&B?

38:00.000 --> 38:01.600
D&D B&B, yes.

38:01.600 --> 38:02.480
That's fucking funny.

38:02.480 --> 38:03.200
That's fucking good.

38:03.200 --> 38:04.480
That's good, TMTMTM.

38:04.480 --> 38:05.840
That's a good joke for a podcast,

38:05.840 --> 38:07.680
but also like good thing for life

38:07.680 --> 38:09.440
if anybody wants that, you can have it.

38:09.440 --> 38:10.320
D&D B&B.

38:10.320 --> 38:11.120
I'm freaking out.

38:12.160 --> 38:12.480
Yeah, I'm rich.

38:12.480 --> 38:14.960
Because how good these ideas and funny ideas are.

38:14.960 --> 38:17.520
Yeah, listen, we almost don't need this.

38:17.520 --> 38:18.720
I feel like at this point,

38:18.720 --> 38:21.040
because it's like we've got a lot of million dollar.

38:22.080 --> 38:22.480
What?

38:22.480 --> 38:23.360
Good news, Justin.

38:23.360 --> 38:24.800
We're not going to keep the money

38:24.800 --> 38:26.560
from Money Zone this week.

38:26.560 --> 38:28.320
Yeah, this week we are donating

38:29.120 --> 38:31.680
the ad money from the episode

38:31.680 --> 38:33.280
to the Marsha P. Johnson Institute.

38:33.280 --> 38:36.080
Marsha P. Johnson was an incredible

38:36.080 --> 38:40.160
black trans activist during the Stonewall riots.

38:40.160 --> 38:42.480
And the Marsha P. Johnson Institute

38:42.480 --> 38:47.520
goes to support and fight for the human rights

38:47.520 --> 38:50.000
of black trans people in America.

38:50.000 --> 38:51.440
And it's a rad organization.

38:51.440 --> 38:52.640
We're going to include a link

38:52.640 --> 38:55.680
to where you can support the Marsha P. Johnson Institute

38:56.320 --> 38:57.440
in the episode description.

38:58.320 --> 38:59.920
So yeah, do that.

38:59.920 --> 39:04.640
And we're going to talk about some sponsors

39:05.440 --> 39:07.600
that sell products and services.

39:08.320 --> 39:08.720
Whoa.

39:08.720 --> 39:09.600
Yeah, that was smooth.

39:09.600 --> 39:10.000
Thanks, bud.

39:10.000 --> 39:22.480
I love my post office.

39:22.480 --> 39:24.480
I'm a first name basis with everybody there.

39:25.040 --> 39:26.160
Love to go there.

39:26.160 --> 39:26.800
Love it.

39:26.800 --> 39:29.040
But right now, you know,

39:29.040 --> 39:30.320
if I can avoid going out,

39:30.320 --> 39:31.440
if I can avoid going somewhere,

39:31.440 --> 39:33.360
no matter how personally painful it may be for me,

39:34.160 --> 39:35.120
I'm going to do it.

39:35.120 --> 39:37.520
You can get a lot of the services,

39:37.520 --> 39:39.040
except for the friendly smiles,

39:39.040 --> 39:42.400
that you get at the post office with stamps.com.

39:43.120 --> 39:45.120
Brings all the services of the post office

39:45.120 --> 39:46.720
right into your home

39:46.720 --> 39:50.640
or wherever you're hiding away right now.

39:50.640 --> 39:53.680
You can use your computer to print official US postage

39:54.400 --> 39:55.920
24 hours a day, seven days a week

39:55.920 --> 39:58.240
for any letter, any package, any class of mail,

39:58.240 --> 39:59.440
anywhere you want to send it.

40:00.160 --> 40:01.040
And once your mail is ready,

40:01.040 --> 40:02.640
you just leave it for your mail carrier.

40:02.640 --> 40:04.000
You schedule a free package pickup

40:04.000 --> 40:05.680
or you just drop it in a mailbox.

40:05.680 --> 40:09.440
It's just that easy and no human contact

40:09.440 --> 40:11.440
required with stamps.com.

40:11.440 --> 40:12.640
I almost said scamps.com.

40:12.640 --> 40:13.680
That'd be a good website too

40:13.680 --> 40:16.160
if anybody's in the market.

40:16.160 --> 40:18.880
You know you can't say the name.

40:18.880 --> 40:21.280
I'm very sure that scamps.com is...

40:21.280 --> 40:22.320
Oh, Justin.

40:22.320 --> 40:22.960
Oh, no.

40:23.920 --> 40:26.240
Oh, this URL redirects

40:26.240 --> 40:29.040
to some truly heinous business friend.

40:29.760 --> 40:31.360
Oh my God.

40:31.360 --> 40:33.440
Oh, look at the scamps.

40:33.440 --> 40:34.960
Oh, God, no.

40:34.960 --> 40:38.720
What's the number for FBI?

40:38.720 --> 40:40.800
It's just full of scamps.

40:42.160 --> 40:44.400
They're doing all kinds of shenanigans.

40:44.400 --> 40:45.600
No way, man.

40:45.600 --> 40:47.200
That one's got a slingshot.

40:47.760 --> 40:52.640
They fucking just stole a pie out of a windowsill.

40:52.640 --> 40:55.360
Oh, no, he's got one of those sassy grins.

40:55.360 --> 40:57.760
Oh, that one just conned a friend

40:57.760 --> 40:59.520
into painting the fence for him.

41:00.080 --> 41:02.240
Right now, our listeners get a special offer

41:02.240 --> 41:05.360
that includes a four-week trial plus free postage

41:05.360 --> 41:09.200
and a digital scale without any long-term commitment.

41:09.200 --> 41:10.320
Just go to stamps.com,

41:10.320 --> 41:12.080
click on the microphone at the top of the homepage

41:12.080 --> 41:14.080
and type in my brother.

41:14.080 --> 41:16.480
That's stamps.com, enter my brother.

41:16.480 --> 41:20.160
Well, this is just a big JPEG of bug hauls alpha

41:20.160 --> 41:21.840
from the Little Rascals movie.

41:22.880 --> 41:24.560
Hey, Griffin, can I ask you a question?

41:24.560 --> 41:24.880
Uh-huh.

41:24.880 --> 41:32.960
Av-hay-oo-yay-in-bay-inking-thay about a e-learning ray.

41:34.800 --> 41:36.400
Have you been thinking about learning that language

41:36.400 --> 41:38.240
you took in high school again or college,

41:38.240 --> 41:40.000
but think it'll take too much time?

41:41.120 --> 41:42.560
I was trying to do Pig Latin.

41:42.560 --> 41:43.920
I know, but you couldn't even do that.

41:43.920 --> 41:46.480
So I think Babbel may be a little bit above your pay grade,

41:46.480 --> 41:47.600
but probably not.

41:47.600 --> 41:48.880
You should dip into it anyway,

41:48.880 --> 41:50.480
because learning is fun.

41:51.040 --> 41:53.680
Yes, Babbel can help you relearn that language fast.

41:53.680 --> 41:55.760
Babbel is designed to quickly get you speaking

41:55.760 --> 41:57.920
your new language within weeks

41:57.920 --> 42:00.800
with daily 10 to 15 minute lessons.

42:00.800 --> 42:03.120
And listen, we all got 10 to 15 minutes.

42:03.120 --> 42:04.240
You got it.

42:04.240 --> 42:05.680
You just put all your toilet time together.

42:05.680 --> 42:07.680
Yeah, and you've been listening to this podcast

42:07.680 --> 42:09.360
for what, 40 minutes?

42:09.360 --> 42:09.920
Thank you.

42:09.920 --> 42:10.720
Good point, Travis.

42:10.720 --> 42:11.360
Turn off this podcast.

42:11.360 --> 42:16.240
Yeah, listen, this says weeks with daily 10 to 15,

42:16.240 --> 42:17.280
what about just one day?

42:17.920 --> 42:19.520
What if you just did it all in one day?

42:19.520 --> 42:21.440
I don't think they want us to say or endorse that.

42:21.440 --> 42:23.440
Pop a limitless pill and learn this language.

42:23.440 --> 42:25.920
Pop a limitless pill and do it all in one day.

42:26.880 --> 42:29.360
And then do another course the next day.

42:30.800 --> 42:32.880
I've tried to learn Spanish several times,

42:32.880 --> 42:36.960
never quite stuck, but I have really been enjoying

42:36.960 --> 42:38.560
going through Babbel and doing the lessons.

42:38.560 --> 42:43.280
They're the most sort of natural and fun to do lessons

42:43.280 --> 42:48.240
that I have found for sort of brushing up,

42:48.240 --> 42:50.160
but also like just learning new vocabulary

42:50.160 --> 42:50.800
and stuff like that.

42:50.800 --> 42:53.840
It is a really, really good service.

42:53.840 --> 42:57.840
You know what language I learned in high school?

42:57.840 --> 42:58.400
What, Griffin?

42:58.400 --> 42:59.440
The language of love.

43:00.560 --> 43:00.880
Gross.

43:01.600 --> 43:04.000
It called me Porky Pig.

43:04.720 --> 43:04.960
Okay.

43:04.960 --> 43:06.080
Because of how much-

43:06.080 --> 43:06.480
Gross.

43:07.920 --> 43:08.480
Gross.

43:09.280 --> 43:10.000
Because of how much-

43:10.000 --> 43:11.360
I was mid coffee sip.

43:11.360 --> 43:14.480
I thought I'd earned it after my great personal endorsement.

43:14.480 --> 43:15.520
But no, you have to take it away from me.

43:15.520 --> 43:17.120
Before you talk about all your porking,

43:17.120 --> 43:19.920
can I mention that Babbel has speech recognition technology

43:19.920 --> 43:22.800
that helps you to improve your pronunciation and accent?

43:22.800 --> 43:25.120
Go ahead and do that, but I want Babbel to know

43:25.120 --> 43:28.720
I am going to talk more about that immediately after the ad

43:28.720 --> 43:30.800
so that it'll be sort of sandwiched in there.

43:31.360 --> 43:35.360
So it's helping you with your accent and your pronunciation too.

43:35.360 --> 43:38.080
Right now, Babbel is offering our listeners three months free

43:38.080 --> 43:39.920
with the purchase of a three-month subscription

43:39.920 --> 43:42.240
with promo code MYBROTHER, all one word.

43:42.240 --> 43:46.240
So go to babbel.com and use promo code MYBROTHER, all one word,

43:46.240 --> 43:47.520
on your three-month subscription.

43:47.520 --> 43:50.160
That's B-A-B-B-E-L dot com.

43:50.160 --> 43:51.680
Promo code MYBROTHER.

43:51.680 --> 43:53.440
Babbel, language for life.

43:53.440 --> 43:55.200
So you're probably thinking like porky pig,

43:55.200 --> 43:57.280
probably because he was porking a lot, right?

43:57.840 --> 43:58.800
But it was-

43:58.800 --> 44:00.400
No, it was my tech-

44:00.400 --> 44:02.240
My technique was I would get down there

44:02.240 --> 44:02.640
and just be like,

44:02.640 --> 44:18.240
a-dee-bee-dee-bee-dee-bee-dee.

44:32.640 --> 44:43.360
Oh, fuck.

44:43.360 --> 44:44.800
You dumb piece of shit.

44:48.320 --> 44:49.440
Despicable people.

44:50.160 --> 44:51.760
How I related to you.

44:51.760 --> 44:53.280
Absolutely the worst.

44:54.320 --> 44:57.280
Man, this is the first time I've ever been sad

44:57.280 --> 44:59.280
that listeners can't tell our voices apart

44:59.280 --> 45:01.440
because I'm afraid they'll think I said nothing.

45:01.440 --> 45:02.800
I almost didn't say anything.

45:02.800 --> 45:03.840
So off-brand.

45:05.680 --> 45:07.280
All our brands are fucked.

45:07.280 --> 45:08.240
That's all of us.

45:10.160 --> 45:11.600
Macho Man to the top rope.

45:12.640 --> 45:13.840
The flying elbow.

45:13.840 --> 45:14.400
The cover.

45:17.040 --> 45:19.040
We've got a new champion.

45:21.440 --> 45:23.280
We're here with Macho Man Randy Savage

45:23.280 --> 45:26.160
after his big win to become the new world champion.

45:26.160 --> 45:27.920
What are you going to do now, Mach?

45:27.920 --> 45:30.080
I'm going to go listen to the newest episode

45:30.080 --> 45:32.080
of the Types of Fights podcast.

45:32.080 --> 45:32.800
Oh, yeah.

45:32.800 --> 45:34.640
Tell us more about this podcast.

45:34.640 --> 45:36.160
It's the podcast of power.

45:36.160 --> 45:37.520
Too sweet to be sour.

45:37.520 --> 45:39.040
Funky like a monkey.

45:39.040 --> 45:40.720
Woke discussions, man.

45:40.720 --> 45:43.760
And jokes about wrestlers' fashion choices.

45:43.760 --> 45:45.440
Myself excluded.

45:45.440 --> 45:46.000
Yeah.

45:46.000 --> 45:47.440
I can't wait to listen.

45:47.440 --> 45:48.560
Neither can I.

45:48.560 --> 45:51.680
You can find it Thursdays on Maximum Fun.

45:51.680 --> 45:52.960
Oh, yeah.

45:52.960 --> 45:53.440
Dig it.

45:53.440 --> 45:58.640
Yeah, I'm not even going to waste anybody's time.

46:04.800 --> 46:05.680
I want to munch.

46:05.680 --> 46:06.180
Squad.

46:08.880 --> 46:10.800
I want to munch.

46:10.800 --> 46:11.300
Squad.

46:14.640 --> 46:16.080
I tried to give that a moderate edge

46:16.080 --> 46:18.240
because, folks, I'm so happy to report

46:18.880 --> 46:22.880
that we have a new munch squad.

46:22.880 --> 46:24.800
We've gone back to the future.

46:24.800 --> 46:26.080
From the now time.

46:26.080 --> 46:27.760
Well, from like a week ago.

46:27.760 --> 46:31.520
But still, from this era, kind of wild.

46:31.520 --> 46:33.200
Actually, not sure it's tasteful.

46:33.760 --> 46:37.760
But these brands are going to brand.

46:37.760 --> 46:39.280
This is their thing that they do.

46:41.680 --> 46:43.600
And here's the story.

46:44.480 --> 46:46.240
A lot of you sent this in, so thank you so much.

46:46.800 --> 46:48.880
Limited edition Pringles flavor packs

46:48.880 --> 46:50.960
the juicy layers of a Wendy's Baconator

46:50.960 --> 46:52.080
into one crunchy bite.

46:52.080 --> 46:53.600
Huh.

46:53.600 --> 46:55.040
Bacon lovers, rejoice.

46:56.480 --> 46:58.720
I'm going to do something real quick.

46:58.720 --> 47:03.040
I'm going to enter that phrase in quotes into Google

47:03.040 --> 47:07.200
and see how many hits that I get.

47:07.200 --> 47:12.320
And the answer is 8,760.

47:12.320 --> 47:15.200
So they have a lot to be thankful for, I think, right now.

47:16.400 --> 47:19.840
But in this situation, it's that the masters of flavor

47:19.840 --> 47:23.840
at Pringles, which I bet that is not a label

47:23.840 --> 47:25.680
that has been applied to them very frequently,

47:25.680 --> 47:28.720
but the masters of flavor at Pringles have done it again.

47:29.280 --> 47:31.920
This time in partnership with the queen of hamburgers.

47:31.920 --> 47:32.480
Oh, boy.

47:33.680 --> 47:34.080
Wendy's.

47:34.080 --> 47:36.800
Just titles being thrown around.

47:36.800 --> 47:37.760
Just the, yeah.

47:38.640 --> 47:41.520
The new limited edition Pringles Baconator packs

47:41.520 --> 47:45.600
all the delicious flavors of packs all the delicious

47:45.600 --> 47:48.080
layers of flavor found in the fan favorite

47:48.080 --> 47:51.280
Wendy's Baconator into one perfectly delicious bite.

47:52.480 --> 47:54.720
When it comes to delivering on a mouthwatering

47:54.720 --> 47:57.520
delicious hamburger, Wendy's doesn't cut corners

47:57.520 --> 48:00.160
with a half pound of fresh, never frozen beef,

48:00.160 --> 48:02.640
American cheese, six strips of crispy apple

48:02.640 --> 48:03.760
with smoked bacon.

48:03.760 --> 48:04.880
This is a chip.

48:04.880 --> 48:07.120
Why are we wasting our time talking about this?

48:07.760 --> 48:10.640
Ketchup and mayonnaise for a Wendy's Baconator,

48:10.640 --> 48:14.960
replicating those delicious layers into one single Pringles crisp.

48:15.600 --> 48:17.840
No challenge is too large for Pringles.

48:17.840 --> 48:18.640
I've heard that.

48:18.640 --> 48:19.520
I have heard.

48:19.520 --> 48:23.440
That's how they're also working on world peace right now.

48:23.440 --> 48:26.240
If no challenge is too large for Pringles,

48:26.240 --> 48:29.520
I would submit that they are maybe wasting their talents

48:29.520 --> 48:31.920
creating bacon hamburger chips.

48:31.920 --> 48:33.520
There's some other pressing concerns

48:33.520 --> 48:35.040
that I would love for them to address.

48:35.040 --> 48:36.800
So Griffin, who's was funnier?

48:38.560 --> 48:40.720
I've been so distracted this whole time

48:40.720 --> 48:42.720
because I've been thinking about how delightful it would be

48:42.720 --> 48:45.200
if Wendy's didn't know about this.

48:45.200 --> 48:49.600
And Pringles was just like, Wendy's doesn't fucking

48:49.600 --> 48:50.480
cut any corners.

48:50.480 --> 48:52.160
Wendy's brings you the good burgers.

48:52.160 --> 48:53.360
We love Wendy's.

48:54.240 --> 48:56.080
So we did a chip on them.

48:56.080 --> 48:57.120
And Wendy's like, oh.

48:59.920 --> 49:00.880
Thank you, I guess.

49:00.880 --> 49:01.380
Thanks.

49:02.880 --> 49:06.240
We squished down 20 of your hamburgers into every chip.

49:07.600 --> 49:13.040
We destroyed them like the guy in No Country for Old Men.

49:13.040 --> 49:15.520
We just went baconator to baconator,

49:15.520 --> 49:20.080
euthanizing them and squishing them down into chips

49:20.080 --> 49:21.360
to prove our love to you.

49:21.360 --> 49:23.360
Wendy's, please recognize us.

49:24.640 --> 49:27.760
The Pringles brand delivers insanely accurate

49:27.760 --> 49:30.880
flavor combinations that are both delicious and convenient,

49:30.880 --> 49:34.320
said Derrick McGuire, senior director of marketing

49:34.320 --> 49:36.880
for Pringles, who seems biased.

49:36.880 --> 49:38.720
What does that mean, convenient?

49:39.360 --> 49:40.320
It's convenient.

49:40.320 --> 49:41.920
With such a strong fan base,

49:41.920 --> 49:43.840
we knew we had to nail that fresh,

49:43.840 --> 49:46.960
never frozen Wendy's flavor perfectly.

49:46.960 --> 49:48.960
Fucking if you could eat a chip and be like,

49:48.960 --> 49:51.040
well, this beef's never been frozen.

49:51.040 --> 49:51.680
I can tell.

49:52.240 --> 49:55.120
Luckily, our flavor experts were up to the task.

49:55.120 --> 49:57.680
The Pringles baconator crisps are the perfect way

49:57.680 --> 50:01.600
to enjoy the savory goodness all in one bite.

50:01.600 --> 50:03.280
Yes, Travis, convenient.

50:04.480 --> 50:06.720
Indulging in a Wendy's baconator craving

50:06.720 --> 50:08.240
has never been easier.

50:08.240 --> 50:10.560
Just break open a can, pop a crisp,

50:10.560 --> 50:13.360
and experience the wonders straight from your pantry.

50:14.320 --> 50:16.240
Yeah, it's for people that it's like,

50:16.240 --> 50:19.280
God, it would be tough to get a hamburger right now.

50:19.280 --> 50:20.880
I'm not sure I can get at it together,

50:20.880 --> 50:22.640
but I do have a craving.

50:22.640 --> 50:23.920
Maybe I'll eat a chip of it.

50:23.920 --> 50:26.320
But this is making it sound like it's a future food

50:26.320 --> 50:28.640
of like a Wendy's baconator in Pilfer.

50:28.640 --> 50:30.320
Like you would eat one chip and be like,

50:30.320 --> 50:32.560
I am stuffed.

50:32.560 --> 50:34.240
That's a baconator right there.

50:34.240 --> 50:38.880
I do not trust Pringles to do a slam dunk

50:38.880 --> 50:40.720
when it comes to recreating flavors,

50:40.720 --> 50:43.760
because in my mind, the different flavors of Pringles

50:43.760 --> 50:46.640
are regular salty, and then like,

50:47.200 --> 50:49.280
maybe I'll give you sour cream,

50:49.280 --> 50:52.400
and then every other one is just the same sort

50:52.400 --> 50:56.800
of unconscionably zesty sort of miasma

50:56.800 --> 50:59.440
that I could not diagnose gun to my head.

51:02.160 --> 51:03.280
Here's good news.

51:03.280 --> 51:06.480
Each can comes with a code on the seal

51:06.480 --> 51:09.600
that can be used to score a free Wendy's baconator,

51:09.600 --> 51:12.720
son of baconator, or breakfast baconator with purchase

51:12.720 --> 51:14.480
when you order through the Wendy's app.

51:14.480 --> 51:16.560
Hey, friends, it's me.

51:16.560 --> 51:19.600
If you use this code to get a son of baconator

51:19.600 --> 51:21.680
when you could have gotten a free baconator,

51:21.680 --> 51:23.440
I'm going to have you committed.

51:24.000 --> 51:28.240
That is for intense lack of value recognition.

51:28.240 --> 51:29.680
That would be a terrible use.

51:29.680 --> 51:30.240
Cut it in half.

51:30.240 --> 51:30.800
Yes.

51:30.800 --> 51:32.720
Cut it in half if it's too much for you.

51:32.720 --> 51:34.480
But don't waste the opportunity.

51:35.040 --> 51:36.320
Take it up a notch.

51:36.320 --> 51:40.480
And pile Pringles baconator on top of a Wendy's baconator.

51:40.480 --> 51:41.120
Whoa.

51:41.120 --> 51:42.320
My ass.

51:42.320 --> 51:42.880
No.

51:42.880 --> 51:44.320
What are you talking about?

51:44.320 --> 51:44.820
Whoa.

51:45.520 --> 51:46.880
Can you imagine?

51:46.880 --> 51:47.200
Why?

51:47.200 --> 51:48.400
Why would you do that?

51:49.040 --> 51:52.240
Or dip the crisp and frosty for a sweet and salty treat.

51:52.240 --> 51:52.640
Now.

51:52.640 --> 51:54.160
Now that sounds good as fuck.

51:54.160 --> 51:57.760
Yeah, now I'm on board with that one.

51:57.760 --> 51:59.120
That made me high.

51:59.120 --> 51:59.440
Whoa.

52:00.560 --> 52:04.000
Instead of making me crave that, it made me high.

52:04.000 --> 52:05.120
That's how much I want that.

52:05.120 --> 52:08.720
At Wendy's, quote, at Wendy's, the baconator has long been

52:08.720 --> 52:11.600
an iconic bacon cheeseburger like no other.

52:11.600 --> 52:13.760
That is a fucking wild sentence.

52:13.760 --> 52:15.520
We're just going to revisit it one more time.

52:15.520 --> 52:18.960
And when you're imagining the verbiage in here,

52:18.960 --> 52:21.600
note the bacon cheeseburger is capitalized.

52:21.600 --> 52:23.360
So maybe that's its formal name.

52:23.360 --> 52:26.480
At Wendy's, the baconator has long been an iconic bacon

52:26.480 --> 52:28.000
cheeseburger like no other.

52:28.560 --> 52:31.840
With stacked fresh beef, which I guess is a descriptor

52:31.840 --> 52:33.840
that leads you to imply quality.

52:33.840 --> 52:36.080
Oh, is that beef stacked?

52:36.720 --> 52:37.680
Yuma, yuma.

52:37.680 --> 52:40.320
I usually lay my shit out on side by side,

52:40.320 --> 52:41.520
not even on the bun.

52:41.520 --> 52:42.320
That's wild.

52:42.320 --> 52:43.040
I didn't even think about that.

52:43.040 --> 52:44.000
When did you stack this?

52:44.000 --> 52:45.440
You stacked this yesterday?

52:45.440 --> 52:46.800
Nah, stacked fresh.

52:47.360 --> 52:50.000
Oven cooked, applewood smoked bacon.

52:50.000 --> 52:51.840
Ooh, you use the oven on it?

52:51.840 --> 52:52.240
Damn.

52:53.280 --> 52:54.960
And piping hot cheese.

52:54.960 --> 52:55.280
What?

52:56.640 --> 52:58.240
This is not part of it.

52:58.240 --> 53:00.480
We knew we were going, it was going to be a challenge

53:00.480 --> 53:03.120
to get all that flavor and goodness into one bite.

53:03.120 --> 53:05.360
Says, and I'm so happy to have him back,

53:05.360 --> 53:09.440
Carl Laredo, Wendy's US chief marketing officer.

53:11.760 --> 53:14.880
We're excited to work with the flavor experts at Pringles

53:14.880 --> 53:19.360
to deliver the tastes our fans know and love in a unique way.

53:19.360 --> 53:21.840
Hey guys, words still mean shit.

53:21.840 --> 53:23.920
Deliver the tastes our fans know and love

53:23.920 --> 53:25.520
in a unique way is nothing.

53:25.520 --> 53:27.520
No, I'll tell you what, what would be a unique way

53:27.520 --> 53:30.320
is if the flavor kings at Pringles

53:30.320 --> 53:34.000
could somehow aerosolize the Baconator

53:34.000 --> 53:35.040
and I could inhale it.

53:35.040 --> 53:36.720
Yes, put it in an IV.

53:36.720 --> 53:37.200
Yes.

53:37.200 --> 53:40.400
We know our Baconator fanatics will be in for quite a treat

53:40.400 --> 53:42.880
when they taste how insanely accurate

53:42.880 --> 53:44.880
Pringles made this delicious crisp.

53:45.840 --> 53:46.960
This is so accurate.

53:46.960 --> 53:48.160
Ah, it's accurate.

53:50.080 --> 53:51.520
You can tell that, that's the end of it,

53:52.080 --> 53:54.560
that you could tell that these people have been like,

53:54.560 --> 53:56.240
that none of these people said any of this

53:56.240 --> 53:58.480
because no one has ever called them a crisp

53:58.480 --> 54:01.440
in their entire life unless they're legally, yeah.

54:01.440 --> 54:04.720
Oh, it's, no, it's actually because it's potato granules

54:04.720 --> 54:06.560
and the potato lobby made it,

54:06.560 --> 54:07.600
the potato chip lobby made it

54:07.600 --> 54:08.960
so that they couldn't call them chips.

54:08.960 --> 54:12.080
So they were legally barred from calling them chips.

54:13.920 --> 54:14.880
It's a true story.

54:14.880 --> 54:16.320
I mean, out of granules to make it easier to transport.

54:16.320 --> 54:18.800
Oh God, I wish I could fucking wedgie you over Skype.

54:18.800 --> 54:20.240
I wish Skype would add some sort of-

54:20.240 --> 54:22.160
Use their transfers because there was a lot of breakage.

54:22.160 --> 54:24.880
I just got confirmation back on my cameo request

54:24.880 --> 54:27.120
from Lance Bass to come wedgie Justin.

54:27.120 --> 54:29.040
He should be showing up right now.

54:29.040 --> 54:30.960
I'm gonna wedgie you to the fucking moon.

54:32.480 --> 54:34.240
Can we do this second question?

54:34.240 --> 54:35.760
Because it'll be very fast.

54:37.440 --> 54:40.240
Sure, yeah, let's do this second question.

54:40.240 --> 54:45.600
I am anticipating just a real quick in and out revolving door

54:46.160 --> 54:49.520
and we give them a harsh talking to

54:49.520 --> 54:51.440
and then the door finishes revolving.

54:51.440 --> 54:53.200
That's what people come to this show for,

54:53.200 --> 54:54.320
harsh talkings to.

54:54.320 --> 54:56.400
Hey brothers, I work at a job that allows me

54:56.400 --> 54:59.600
to drive around my city all day long making frequent stops.

54:59.600 --> 55:02.960
I keep a small fishing pole and a box of tackle in my car

55:02.960 --> 55:04.400
as there are lots of good fishing holes

55:04.400 --> 55:06.000
randomly throughout my city.

55:06.000 --> 55:08.480
Anytime I have a spare hour between sessions,

55:08.480 --> 55:10.560
I will go to the nearest pond or fishing hole

55:10.560 --> 55:11.920
and have a few casts.

55:11.920 --> 55:13.840
Recently, I found a choice looking pond

55:13.840 --> 55:15.440
that I've never seen anybody fishing at.

55:15.440 --> 55:16.960
It seems like a prime spot.

55:16.960 --> 55:18.720
However, it's located in a cemetery-

55:18.720 --> 55:19.760
Stop it!

55:20.800 --> 55:23.120
There are no signs saying do not fish here,

55:23.120 --> 55:25.760
but I feel weird about just walking up with my gear

55:25.760 --> 55:26.800
and making a cast.

55:26.800 --> 55:27.760
Is this wrong?

55:27.760 --> 55:29.040
Am I being paranoid?

55:29.040 --> 55:30.800
Am I just begging to be cursed?

55:30.800 --> 55:31.840
Please help.

55:31.840 --> 55:34.240
That's from Fishy Dilemma in Oklahoma City,

55:34.240 --> 55:36.320
the city of a thousand fishing holes.

55:36.320 --> 55:38.080
Apparently.

55:38.800 --> 55:41.840
I've just figured out what I want my epitaph to say,

55:41.840 --> 55:44.960
I guess, and it is do not fish here

55:44.960 --> 55:48.800
because apparently we need one of them in every cemetery

55:48.800 --> 55:52.080
informing people that this cemetery water feature

55:52.080 --> 55:55.760
probably does not have game fish in it

55:55.760 --> 55:58.160
for you to go digging around in.

55:58.160 --> 56:01.760
Honey, I brought home some koi for us to fry up.

56:01.760 --> 56:04.480
Graveyard koi, honey, my favorite.

56:04.480 --> 56:08.720
The spirits of ancestors have been transferred into them

56:08.720 --> 56:10.800
and that's where the flavor comes from.

56:10.800 --> 56:13.920
I've never, it's the weirdest fucking thing.

56:13.920 --> 56:16.800
Beautiful, beautiful big pond

56:16.800 --> 56:20.560
and I've never seen anyone fishing at it.

56:20.560 --> 56:23.520
It's such a prime spot too.

56:23.520 --> 56:27.440
I would also point out, question asker,

56:27.440 --> 56:29.200
if you include the phrase,

56:29.200 --> 56:32.480
but I feel weird about just walking up with my gear

56:32.480 --> 56:33.840
and making a cast,

56:33.840 --> 56:36.000
and then follow that up with next sentence,

56:36.000 --> 56:37.040
is this wrong?

56:37.760 --> 56:41.040
Kind of seems like you might know the answer

56:41.040 --> 56:42.880
to that particular question.

56:43.760 --> 56:44.080
Am I begging?

56:44.080 --> 56:47.040
Yeah, I just kind of post up on someone's headstone

56:47.040 --> 56:49.520
with my Milwaukee's best.

56:49.520 --> 56:50.240
That's great.

56:50.240 --> 56:51.200
Cast on in there.

56:51.920 --> 56:56.240
It's just, the thought that you are begging to be cursed

56:56.240 --> 57:00.080
is also like, that shouldn't have to be the repercussion here.

57:01.360 --> 57:04.960
If I am at Peppy Pep's funeral,

57:05.840 --> 57:07.360
although it's more of a funerals

57:07.360 --> 57:11.120
because Peppy Pep had some really zany requests,

57:11.120 --> 57:11.600
but I do look-

57:11.600 --> 57:12.720
He lived a good life.

57:12.720 --> 57:14.720
He led a great fun life

57:14.720 --> 57:17.200
until he died in that turbo hang glider accident.

57:18.720 --> 57:19.440
But I do look-

57:19.440 --> 57:21.440
You begged him not to sign the release forms.

57:21.440 --> 57:24.720
And I just finished singing, dancing on the ceiling,

57:25.280 --> 57:27.120
and I look to the left,

57:27.120 --> 57:30.720
and just out of eye shot of this incredible funeral

57:30.720 --> 57:36.560
is you and your waiters fucking doing some fly fishing

57:36.560 --> 57:38.720
into the, there's no way.

57:39.600 --> 57:42.240
There's no way that will be acceptable.

57:42.240 --> 57:45.040
I don't even know what this next sentence means,

57:45.040 --> 57:48.560
but me and the entire funeral party will come get you.

57:48.560 --> 57:50.480
And I don't even know what that means,

57:50.480 --> 57:52.400
but there's no way we can let that be.

57:54.000 --> 57:57.440
Can you imagine being like the groundskeeper at a cemetery

57:57.440 --> 58:00.000
and like walking up and seeing somebody fishing in a pond?

58:00.000 --> 58:01.760
Like, I don't even think you get angry

58:01.760 --> 58:04.960
so much as you just be like, you can't do this.

58:04.960 --> 58:06.400
No, you can't do this.

58:06.400 --> 58:12.240
I shouldn't have to tell you not to catch those.

58:12.240 --> 58:16.640
We don't stock this pond with fish for you to catch.

58:16.640 --> 58:19.680
These are for the ghosts to catch, you know that.

58:20.720 --> 58:22.640
Folks, thank you so much for listening to our show.

58:22.640 --> 58:23.760
We hope you've enjoyed yourself.

58:23.760 --> 58:24.880
We hope you're hanging in there.

58:25.360 --> 58:28.960
If you're protesting, we hope that you're trying

58:28.960 --> 58:30.960
to stay as safe as possible.

58:32.000 --> 58:34.560
If you're not able to, or you feel like you need

58:34.560 --> 58:38.240
to do something and participate,

58:38.240 --> 58:42.640
you can go to blacklivesmatters.carrd.co.

58:43.840 --> 58:46.080
There's petitions you can sign, places to call,

58:46.080 --> 58:48.160
you can donate even without spending money,

58:48.960 --> 58:51.520
voting, information for protesters, whatever you need.

58:52.320 --> 58:53.600
That is a great place to start.

58:54.160 --> 58:56.000
And we would encourage you to do so just as,

58:56.000 --> 59:00.400
even though it may not be as front of mind in the media,

59:00.400 --> 59:03.840
that, you know, the push still goes on there.

59:03.840 --> 59:06.480
And again, check out the Marsha P. Johnson Institute.

59:06.480 --> 59:09.840
We got links to that in the episode description.

59:09.840 --> 59:12.320
Hey, thanks to John Roderick and the Long Winters

59:12.320 --> 59:13.120
for these four theme songs.

59:13.120 --> 59:14.800
A departure off the album, putting the days to bed.

59:14.800 --> 59:21.440
Great tunes, great track, lots of positive vibes there, man.

59:21.440 --> 59:24.160
And thank you to MaximumFun.org for having us on the network.

59:24.160 --> 59:25.520
Check out all the great shows there,

59:25.520 --> 59:30.720
like Tights and Fights and Fanti and all the others.

59:30.720 --> 59:31.760
MaximumFun.org.

59:32.400 --> 59:34.960
You can go to McElroyMerch.com and check out

59:34.960 --> 59:36.960
all the cool McElroy merch,

59:37.520 --> 59:40.240
including a good out here t-shirt

59:40.240 --> 59:43.520
and a phantasmal and resplendent pen.

59:43.520 --> 59:47.760
And again, both of those are the proceeds

59:47.760 --> 59:49.840
from which we'll go to the Trevor Project

59:50.560 --> 59:52.080
in celebration of Pride Month.

59:52.080 --> 59:53.040
So go check those out.

59:54.480 --> 59:54.960
Is that it?

59:54.960 --> 59:56.560
Should we do the final?

59:56.560 --> 59:56.960
Yeah, let's do it.

59:56.960 --> 59:57.760
Here's the final Yahoo.

59:57.760 --> 59:59.440
It was sent in by lots of people

59:59.440 --> 01:00:01.280
and it is an anonymous Yahoo Answers user.

01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:06.160
And their name is actually Cram.

01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:09.440
Cram.

01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:09.840
Cram.

01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:12.720
Cram, you say.

01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:15.520
Is that like Cram Cram is the name?

01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:16.960
No, it's just Cram.

01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:18.320
I misspoke the first time.

01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:21.440
It's C-R-A-M-M.

01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:23.440
Thank you for your honesty.

01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:24.240
I appreciate that.

01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:25.040
Cram asks,

01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:28.720
I thought Tim Allen was dead.

01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:30.240
Who am I confusing him with?

01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:35.680
Oh, my name is Justin McElroy.

01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:36.960
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:38.080
I'm Griffin McElroy.

01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:40.080
This has been My Brother, My Brother and Me.

01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:43.280
Kiss your dad, square on the lips.
