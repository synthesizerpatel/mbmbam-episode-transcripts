WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:50.320
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to my brother, my brother and me. This is an election alert.

00:50.320 --> 00:56.160
Travis. Scandal, scandals and scams here on the political front. My brother, my brother and me

00:56.160 --> 01:03.600
gate 2012. Electioneering. Ladies and gentlemen, all we've heard from the politicians is that they

01:03.600 --> 01:10.000
want us to rock the vote. Get out there and rock the vote. Rock the vote. Rock the vote, baby.

01:10.000 --> 01:17.360
Rock the vote. Don't tip the vote over. Yeah. Inspired by their please, we brothers decided

01:17.360 --> 01:23.120
to make an effort, and for the first time in our adult lives, vote for a presidential candidate,

01:23.120 --> 01:29.040
and we were barred from voting. I showed up at my polling place, and I was like, I'm ready to punch

01:29.040 --> 01:35.440
my ticket for the campaign that you, the listener, want me to vote for. And they said, this is a

01:35.440 --> 01:39.920
Kentucky Fried Chicken, sir. Please get out. They said, this is an elementary school that is currently

01:39.920 --> 01:48.720
in session. You cannot be here right now. Barring my voting, can I please have a super donut? As

01:48.720 --> 01:57.040
long as I'm here at this school. Not that it will in any way, quelch the injustice. No. That has,

01:57.680 --> 02:02.960
quelch is quelch award. Quelch is, sure. Squelch? Squelch is when, I think it's like the form where

02:02.960 --> 02:11.280
people eat poop. Okay. So listen. Quelch and you queef at the same time. Oh God. Here's what I'm

02:11.280 --> 02:15.920
concerned about. More than, I am concerned, obviously, that I don't get to participate in

02:15.920 --> 02:21.600
our nation's greatest franchise. There it is. That's the big one. Second big one is that Jay's

02:21.600 --> 02:28.480
told me, I'm going to fucking die now. I'm going to fucking die. Because he offered me a choice,

02:28.480 --> 02:34.080
and it was vote or die. Did you say Jay's? Jay's, it's short for Jay Z. The nation said,

02:34.080 --> 02:38.640
you can't vote Griffin. And by the nation, I mean the principal of McCluskey's elementary school

02:38.640 --> 02:45.520
nearby. McCluskey's is what the elementary school is called. And I can't vote, so I'm a fucking dead

02:45.520 --> 02:49.840
man now. I don't know how it's going to happen. Well, he's had a good run. But death is just

02:49.840 --> 02:54.160
looming around the corner, I guess. Jay Z has an army of assassins. They're hiding in the rafters.

02:54.160 --> 02:58.960
So is it just like P Diddy and Jay Z just roll around town being like, you vote? Did you vote?

02:58.960 --> 03:02.960
You didn't vote? Dead. No, I imagine they have people for that. It's sort of like,

03:02.960 --> 03:10.080
have you seen the new season of Making the Band? Yes, of course. So in episode two, they make him

03:10.080 --> 03:14.320
get him a cheesecake from Jersey, and they have two hours to do it. And then the episode after

03:14.320 --> 03:21.040
that, they go around and they kill disinterested youths. I see. Yeah, that's what happened to Biggie.

03:21.040 --> 03:25.280
They were like, Biggie, did you vote? And he's like, only in the national elections,

03:25.280 --> 03:29.360
not on the local bond issues. And they shot him for that. They shot him. That's something they

03:29.360 --> 03:34.480
shot him for. Guys, flip your fucking ballot. Vote on the back. Yeah, come on. You know,

03:34.480 --> 03:39.040
there's stuff back there. You think you punch, you go straight. President Bartlett is disappointed

03:39.040 --> 03:43.680
in you if you don't vote on the back, bitches. Oh, can we start our own thing? Like, there's

03:43.680 --> 03:47.200
important stuff. Like, if you go straight ticket, you're not going to get it. Can we get like a,

03:47.200 --> 03:52.640
can we get t-shirts with like flip that bitch on it? Flip that bitch. Flip that bitch and vote its

03:52.640 --> 03:58.240
ass out. Jed Bartlett says flip that bitch. I want to get into the advice because theoretically,

03:58.240 --> 04:04.240
that's what this program is about. But I did want to call everybody's attention to two emails that

04:04.240 --> 04:12.000
just showed up in my inbox as I was preparing to look at our question list for the first time.

04:12.000 --> 04:20.480
Two emails back to back from Amazon. The first is alerting me that my book about how to be

04:20.480 --> 04:26.560
fiscally responsible has shipped that I ordered on Friday. Ironically, it cost $3,500.

04:27.760 --> 04:34.960
The email directly after that alerts me that my DVD of the complete series of Captain Power has

04:34.960 --> 04:42.240
shipped. It occurs to me that the email of the book about financial solvency should just read,

04:42.240 --> 04:47.840
don't do that thing you did above. If you can keep yourself from doing that, I think you will be in

04:47.840 --> 04:54.800
good shape. Step one, delete Amazon. Yeah, right. Borrow yourself from Amazon. This is My Brother,

04:54.800 --> 04:59.040
My Brother, Me. It's an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm

04:59.040 --> 05:03.360
your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy. I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy. Guys,

05:03.360 --> 05:11.440
you got to reg to voe. Literally, it's the easiest fucking thing in the world. Yeah. Yeah,

05:11.440 --> 05:20.160
you can get online and reg to voe at regtovoe.org. Reg to voe.org, just double checking that.

05:20.720 --> 05:28.240
Number two, or write T-O-O. It's a very confusing URL. And then whether you go with Barry or if you

05:28.240 --> 05:35.200
go with Mitt, either way. Either way, our nation ends up a winner because of democracy. Or if you

05:35.200 --> 05:41.280
go for some weird third-party candidate, some crazy, stupid fucking third-party candidate.

05:41.280 --> 05:47.040
Yeah. Or maybe if you just want to shit your vote into the sun. Whatever, it's up to you.

05:47.040 --> 05:53.200
I respect your stupid fucking choice. Yeah. Do that dumbass thing you did. But if the nation

05:53.200 --> 05:58.400
fucks up, it's your fucking fault, you big... If you want to write in us, this is an option.

05:58.400 --> 06:02.720
Yeah. Something you can do. If we get 5% of the vote, we get funding. So that's pretty nice.

06:02.720 --> 06:11.920
That's great. I had a sign pasted in the window of my Cutlass Sierra that just said,

06:11.920 --> 06:19.280
Bush and Gore make me want a Ralph. And that was in 19... What is it?

06:19.280 --> 06:27.200
1974. That was in the year 2000. I used to be so young and so willing to just shoot my vote

06:27.200 --> 06:31.440
into the sun. You were also a... I actually registered Green Party the first time I

06:31.440 --> 06:37.680
registered. Yeah. I registered independent, I think. You were actually a charter member of

06:37.680 --> 06:44.400
the Bob Dole Patrol, if memory serves. Right. That was a political action group that I was

06:44.400 --> 06:51.600
in when I was 16 that was devoted to the fact that Bob Dole is kind of funny. So that was

06:52.720 --> 07:02.640
not a lot of big changes. Poetically, there's a nice syllogism with Bob Dole and the word patrol.

07:02.640 --> 07:06.000
And when you put them together, it sounds like a thing that you can really be a part of.

07:06.640 --> 07:09.280
Yeah, it sounds really good. It was like a Bob Dole street team.

07:09.280 --> 07:15.040
Syllogism may not be the right word for that, but it sounded like the right word to use in that

07:15.040 --> 07:24.480
scenario. So anyway, questions, advice, help. My boss at work has an odd way to say a passing hello

07:24.480 --> 07:30.880
and it's confusing me. Walk by me and say, what do you think? But not asking about anything in

07:30.880 --> 07:37.680
particular. This happens a few times every day and I don't know how to respond. What kind of

07:37.680 --> 07:42.400
thing should I say? Should I come up with a standard response or should I mix it up a little

07:42.400 --> 07:48.240
bit? Help me, brothers. That's from Confusion Cincinnati. There's literally so many ways to

07:48.240 --> 07:54.080
respond to this. What do you think? My favorite being, what do you think? Yeah. Just turn the

07:54.080 --> 08:01.360
mirror up to nature and make him go, that doesn't make any sense. Exactly. Does this guy have a

08:01.360 --> 08:09.680
fucking aphasia? What is going on? Maybe he's losing weight and so every time he sees you,

08:09.680 --> 08:15.440
he wants to know what you think of this slimmer silhouette. What do you think? How's this visage?

08:16.240 --> 08:23.280
What do you think of this lean body? I guess, what can you do? That's a pretty good response,

08:23.280 --> 08:29.360
right? What do you think? What can you do? No, I think you've got to randomly pick an adjective

08:29.360 --> 08:33.680
that you can give to him as a response. Like, oh, pretty wet or something like that. See,

08:33.680 --> 08:37.440
I was going to say a noun and you're going to be like, potatoes. Well, that doesn't make sense

08:37.440 --> 08:42.800
because when he's asking, what do you think we're going to have for lunch? Okay. But he would say

08:42.800 --> 08:49.520
that, I think. What do you think? Maybe there's someone that always sees your boss before you

08:49.520 --> 08:54.960
that says, do you guys want to go out after work? And then the boss is saying what you think about

08:54.960 --> 08:59.280
it. But you were not part of the A part of the conversation. Okay. And so he dips your head. And

08:59.280 --> 09:07.040
then your response to what should we eat for lunch is potatoes. Potatoes. Mash them, boil them,

09:07.040 --> 09:18.080
stick them in a stew. I don't know. Travis is a bore, so it's good. Grub? Grub? Travis is Timon

09:18.080 --> 09:24.320
and I'm Pumba and we have a comedy podcast. It's called Timon and Pumba. And not Griffin.

09:24.320 --> 09:31.440
And not Griffin because he's not down with bugs. Hey, maybe that's a good response. What do you

09:31.440 --> 09:42.640
think? Hakuna matata. I love it. Maybe is an option. Hakuna matata. Okay, here's what you do.

09:42.640 --> 09:50.720
What do you think? If it's Wednesday, you say hump day. And then if it's Monday, you say pump day.

09:50.720 --> 09:58.560
Tuesday's jump day. Thursday's dump day. Friday's sump day. And Friday's sump day. Right. So you

09:58.560 --> 10:08.400
just kind of really keep them off. This to me seems like the aesthetic ideal, like the culmination

10:08.400 --> 10:19.520
of all sort of insubstantial office phrases. Like all of the things like, I guess it's Monday and

10:19.520 --> 10:26.000
looking forward to the weekend. I feel like this is, he has boiled it down into a single freight.

10:26.000 --> 10:31.040
He seems like the master of office ology. Hey, have you guys ever heard of Dilbert?

10:32.160 --> 10:38.960
Yeah. The only response that is appropriate to this is like a prolonged atonal shout.

10:43.600 --> 10:47.680
That's what it'll come to. This is what office conversations devolved into.

10:47.680 --> 10:51.200
Yeah, this really is the next step before just like-

10:52.160 --> 10:57.840
Just slapping each other in the face. Let me hit you with this confusion,

10:57.840 --> 11:02.800
sister Nanny. How's this grab you? How long do you have? Oh man. That sounds good, right?

11:02.800 --> 11:06.240
What do you think? How long do you have? And then you go about your merry way. Yeah,

11:06.240 --> 11:13.520
because he doesn't want to fuck with that. He's dueling with you. He sets you up to see like,

11:13.520 --> 11:19.360
can you say something even more inane than the thing that I just said? And then he says,

11:19.360 --> 11:23.200
oh, well me, I've got all day. And then you just stand in the hallway and stare at each other.

11:23.760 --> 11:27.200
And then that's your whole- Why don't you carry around in your pocket

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
a magic eight ball? Okay.

11:30.000 --> 11:36.800
And every time you ask, shake it and be like, ask again later. Think about it. Think about it.

11:36.800 --> 11:43.600
Okay. Why don't you just say, why don't you say hello, you creepy fuck, instead of the thing

11:43.600 --> 11:45.840
that you just- Why don't you talk to me? Why don't you quit your job?

11:45.840 --> 11:47.760
Listen, I'm not someone- Get a different job.

11:47.760 --> 11:54.800
I'm not a cog in this office machine. I'm a human fucking being. I was born,

11:54.800 --> 12:02.960
like you were born, except I was born in a bathtub. Listen, I'm going to die one day.

12:02.960 --> 12:07.440
I have dead friends and relatives. We've all shared the same pain and heartache.

12:07.440 --> 12:12.720
We're all just trying to get by. Just fucking talk to me like a human being.

12:13.360 --> 12:17.200
But here's my question about this. Is there any difference between like,

12:17.200 --> 12:22.320
what do you think and like, hey, how's it going? What's up? How you doing? Like,

12:22.320 --> 12:26.640
the answer doesn't fucking matter because nobody really wants the answer to the question.

12:26.640 --> 12:29.760
You know, because if they did, they'd stop and be like, hey, are you doing all right?

12:29.760 --> 12:33.840
How's it going? What's up? It's always said in passing. What do you think?

12:33.840 --> 12:38.880
It's just a string of words that sounds in some way pleasant, but non-committal.

12:38.880 --> 12:45.600
And it's hard because people give me a hard time for doing everything in my power to try to ignore

12:45.600 --> 12:49.680
the fact that people are around me or to try to keep from acknowledging people's presence.

12:49.680 --> 12:55.040
But I'm just trying to avoid conversations like this. We have nothing to say to each other usually.

12:55.040 --> 13:00.560
That's it. I'd rather have this than somebody that just goes, hey, as they pass you and you're like,

13:02.080 --> 13:04.000
are you just acknowledging the fact that I exist?

13:04.560 --> 13:08.080
Can we just all high five? You know, like, hey, up top.

13:08.080 --> 13:10.400
Wordlessly, emotionally high five.

13:11.520 --> 13:16.000
Exactly. Like cursory, perfunctory, professional.

13:16.000 --> 13:20.720
You don't have to make it an event every time. Just like you're walking by. Boom.

13:20.720 --> 13:26.160
And then maybe like they did a really great job in the account and you're like, hey, down low.

13:26.160 --> 13:27.920
You know? Down low. Too slow.

13:27.920 --> 13:28.880
You make it count. Sorry, boss.

13:30.240 --> 13:31.280
Ugh. Griffin.

13:31.280 --> 13:36.400
I could never work in a fucking office, man. It's, oh God.

13:37.280 --> 13:43.440
I would be the weirdest dude at the office. At this point now, my like, I used to work in,

13:43.440 --> 13:47.760
when I worked in newspapers, I would work in offices and I managed to like keep a

13:47.760 --> 13:53.520
uh, fucking leash on whatever my situation is. But now that I've been working at home for this long,

13:53.520 --> 13:54.560
I would li- Oh my God.

13:54.560 --> 13:58.240
I would be so high strung. If somebody walked up to me and said like,

13:58.240 --> 14:02.080
what do you think? I'd be like, just please no. Please no. Please.

14:02.080 --> 14:06.880
I would be that guy who stacks up books around his cubicle so you can't see what he's doing.

14:06.880 --> 14:10.240
Like I would be the weird hermit in the corner.

14:10.960 --> 14:15.120
See, I work, I work in an office, but it's a theater office. And so like,

14:15.120 --> 14:20.640
if I were to transition to like a real adult place, then they probably wouldn't approve of

14:20.640 --> 14:25.440
my mind and my friends games of like flipping people off during meetings as long as nobody

14:25.440 --> 14:30.560
noticed. And like me sitting in my cubicle and converting Nerf guns into steampunk weaponry.

14:30.560 --> 14:30.800
Like-

14:30.800 --> 14:34.080
We used to have, we used to have a game like that when I worked at Best Buy

14:34.640 --> 14:38.720
where my friend Stevo, who, as people call him Stevo, it wasn't a nickname.

14:40.160 --> 14:44.880
My friend Stevo would, whenever a boss was, had their back turned to us,

14:44.880 --> 14:49.360
he would flip them off. And he would always say, he was giving them a quote,

14:49.360 --> 14:54.640
cold one right between the shoulder blades. That's how he would describe it. Did you see that?

14:54.640 --> 14:58.800
I just gave Deborah a cold one between the shoulder blades. Like yeah, you got her again,

14:58.800 --> 15:01.120
Stevo. I guess. I guess.

15:01.120 --> 15:05.200
How about a Yahoo? This one was sent in by Jack Mack. Thanks Jack Mack.

15:05.200 --> 15:07.600
Hi for listening, Stevo. Hey, who's listening?

15:07.600 --> 15:12.080
He's not. He's dead. Thanks Jack Mack. Yeah, this one was asked by Yahoo!

15:12.080 --> 15:17.200
answers user Natalie, who asks, what's the point of drinking so much water if you're just going

15:17.200 --> 15:20.240
to pee it all out? Thank you.

15:20.240 --> 15:25.200
I'll drink full water bottles a day because I hear about how important it is to drink lots of water

15:25.200 --> 15:30.720
and then I have to pee all the time? What's the point? It comes right out, like 20 men after I

15:30.720 --> 15:40.240
drink it. No, but really. Okay, seriously though. Yeah. Why is my, okay, listen, I know this seems

15:40.240 --> 15:47.520
like a crazy question, but why is science telling me to drink eight glasses of water

15:48.080 --> 15:52.000
if I'm just going to pee it? My body doesn't even pee it, you guys.

15:52.000 --> 15:56.080
Yeah, my body's not using that liquid, right? That's true. That is true. That's true because

15:56.080 --> 16:02.800
whenever you pee, your pee is, and I don't want to get gross, but it is just the exact fluids that

16:02.800 --> 16:07.440
you put in your mouth that went through your body like a silly straw and then it comes out. That's

16:07.440 --> 16:11.520
like sometimes you drink a lot of Coke and then you pee and it's just Coke, you know? Or when you

16:11.520 --> 16:16.000
drink a lot of Ecto Coolers and it's just straight Ecto Coolers. Chav, you shouldn't be drinking,

16:16.000 --> 16:20.320
sorry, they stopped making Ecto Coolers in like 1985. You shouldn't be drinking those.

16:20.320 --> 16:25.600
It doesn't go bad, Griffin. It's already green. What's going to happen? It doesn't go bad. It

16:25.600 --> 16:32.240
goes spooky. Oh, it's thick like mood slime. Yeah. Also, I sleep 18 hours a day. Okay.

16:32.240 --> 16:41.440
Not on purpose. No, this is important. See guys, the water catches all the stuff that's in you

16:41.440 --> 16:47.040
that's bad and then it takes it out of your body. Okay, compare it to the movie Osmosis Jones. What

16:47.040 --> 16:54.560
does it do? Osmosis Jones. So you got fucking Chris Rock and he's Osmosis Jones and then you

16:54.560 --> 16:59.520
have the big pill guy that's played by David Hyde Pierce? Yep. And he's in there and they're

16:59.520 --> 17:03.840
fighting, okay, and they're fighting all the guys. But what if instead of those two, there was a

17:03.840 --> 17:11.520
bunch of water and we'll say that the water is played by... God, I just can't think of a funny

17:11.520 --> 17:16.080
actor off the top of my head. Jon Hamm. Medea. It's played by Medea, the actor.

17:20.320 --> 17:24.560
Imagine that movie, it was six minutes long because that's how long it takes for fluid to go

17:24.560 --> 17:29.200
through your body. Uh-huh. Right. And Chris Rock is there and he's speaking like Chris Rock like I

17:29.200 --> 17:37.360
can't. Just give it a try. Without alienating our listeners. So Chris Rock is there, he says,

17:37.360 --> 17:42.320
I'm Osmosis Jones. And so he's there and he's fighting the crime. And then all of a sudden,

17:42.320 --> 17:47.600
the movie's over because a flood hits them, like sort of like deep impact and everyone dies. But

17:47.600 --> 17:52.960
then it's good that they're dead because they're poisonous bacteria. Osmosis Jones is just the

17:52.960 --> 17:57.600
story of the day Bill Murray forgot to drink water. That's all that happens. Did you guys remember

17:57.600 --> 18:02.320
they're in Bill Murray's body? They totally were. Would it be great? I would love to see a remake

18:02.320 --> 18:07.680
of Osmosis Jones that took place in Travis's body. It would be like fucking Dante's Inferno.

18:11.680 --> 18:17.840
Hey, don't you guys think... Did you guys ever watch Slim Goodbody? You know, the picture of...

18:17.840 --> 18:25.840
Wouldn't it be awesome if just once you could see like an awesome dookie inside him? Slim Goodbody?

18:25.840 --> 18:32.080
Yeah, like one ribald... You're saying like if you could look through Slim Goodbody and see a

18:32.080 --> 18:36.640
pit performing... Just one episode, like a deleted scene somewhere where he's like eyes aren't...

18:36.640 --> 18:43.200
And a bunch of corned beef. I gotta get fit and then go shit. I'm packing a solid... Excuse me,

18:43.200 --> 18:49.920
everyone. I'm packing a solid bolus in here. This is going to turn... Hey, Slim, is that a balloon

18:49.920 --> 18:58.080
full of heroin inside you? Did you ingest that? That's horrifying. Let's get real. Let's get real.

18:58.080 --> 19:05.920
Let's drop the stigma and let's just get real science in this, okay? Okay, finally. It feels

19:05.920 --> 19:13.040
great when you pee and you look at the pee and it's totally clear. You feel like you're doing

19:13.040 --> 19:16.800
such a great job keeping yourself healthy. You feel like you just did a hundred sit-ups because

19:16.800 --> 19:23.920
you know that your drink game is right. Yeah, right. I think that is its own reward. Sure.

19:23.920 --> 19:28.640
Because it's like, you know, potty training and then you go to the big show and you really step

19:28.640 --> 19:33.440
it up. Yeah. Gold medal. There's a lot of internal processes that you don't know about.

19:33.440 --> 19:39.520
Do you guys ever get... It's like nine o'clock at night and you feel like dog shit and you realize

19:39.520 --> 19:44.800
it's because you literally haven't drank a drop of water all day. Yeah. That happens to me. I keep

19:44.800 --> 19:49.440
a bottle just pumping. It happens to me. I'll look down and I'll see like, oh, there's an empty glass

19:49.440 --> 19:55.200
of wine and a beer and two empty Diet Sunkist cans. It's like, ah, fuck. That's all I drank today?

19:55.840 --> 20:00.080
Then you'll pee in them. Why would you fucking do that, Travis?

20:00.080 --> 20:04.160
Because they're right there. He doesn't have to be. He's not drinking any water,

20:04.160 --> 20:06.800
weren't you listening? He would still pee with wine. It's just red.

20:07.680 --> 20:11.040
You don't know what you're fucking talking about. What are you talking about? You're not a scientist,

20:11.040 --> 20:17.440
like, Griffin. Did you miss when I said it's time to get real science? No. And you were like,

20:17.440 --> 20:24.960
I want to get weird science. Let's get Kim Cotrol up in here. Was she not? I think you could... I

20:24.960 --> 20:31.760
love the after movie pee. That's always such a good one. When you really... I mean, it is essential.

20:31.760 --> 20:38.640
I think that there are some movies that I actually remember more fondly because of the awesome,

20:38.640 --> 20:44.720
awesome pee I had afterwards. But at the same time, there's nothing worse than the revolt that

20:44.720 --> 20:49.120
happens in your body when you're in the... I remember I was watching Captain America in theaters

20:49.120 --> 20:54.480
and an hour in, all I had to do was pee. And I was so mad at my body. You got to go. You got to go,

20:54.480 --> 20:58.080
or else you'll make it to the end of the movie and your friends will be like, what did you think?

20:58.080 --> 21:03.040
You'd be like, I fucking hated it. I was so stressed out the whole time. And now I have

21:03.040 --> 21:10.880
liver problems. Yeah. It makes the fight a lot more climactic. Just beat him. Just beat the red

21:10.880 --> 21:15.680
skull. Just hit him. Just shoot him with a gun or something. Jesus. I am incapable of that.

21:15.680 --> 21:21.440
Just shoot him with a gun or something. Jesus. I am incapable of making it through a whole

21:21.440 --> 21:25.040
movie without peeing, which I should probably talk to a doctor about. It's mostly because

21:25.040 --> 21:28.640
I watch movies at the draft house. And so I'm constantly drinking while I'm watching the movie

21:28.640 --> 21:32.640
and that stuff just goes right through me. So I've actually gotten very good at identifying

21:32.640 --> 21:37.120
the moment in a movie where it's like, oh, here comes some exposition. I can go. I have a minute

21:37.120 --> 21:42.960
and a half. I'll run. I don't want to turn into an app, but you guys know there's an app for that,

21:42.960 --> 21:50.480
right? Wait, really? What? Yeah. It's called Run Pee. Uh, and I use it in every movie and it tells

21:50.480 --> 21:56.560
you when to go pee and then it gives you a timer for how long you can go. And then it tells you

21:56.560 --> 22:01.280
what you missed so you can read it while you're peeing. That's fucking brilliant. It's free. Yeah.

22:01.280 --> 22:06.800
It's called Run Pee. I would use that as a review for the film because if it tells me like, oh,

22:06.800 --> 22:11.040
there's a good like 45 minutes there where you can just go, you can pee, you could read a magazine.

22:11.040 --> 22:15.280
Really indulge yourself. And then I will know that that the director is just wasting my time.

22:15.280 --> 22:19.520
My dad, when we go, I go to the movies sometimes with dad and when I get back,

22:19.520 --> 22:25.760
he'll try to fill me in on what I missed. Right? Oh no, don't worry. No need. I timed mine.

22:25.760 --> 22:28.080
Thanks daddy. But I just peed on my iPhone.

22:30.160 --> 22:34.800
Daddy. Yeah. That's the other thing about it is it has a, it has a receptacle for you. Just to

22:34.800 --> 22:38.080
make sure that like all your, your chemicals are balanced and you're getting the right amount of

22:38.080 --> 22:42.320
nutrients. Daddy, I'm sorry. I made a whoopsie on my iPhone. Please don't, please don't talk.

22:43.840 --> 22:49.120
But I really enjoyed Road to Perdition. Thank you for bringing me to this movie in 1988.

22:49.120 --> 22:52.800
Daddy. Sorry. I peed on the iPhone. Oh my God. This iPhone's for the future.

22:56.800 --> 23:02.480
Hey, why did I pee on my futuristic iPhone? Every year I go to at least seven or eight

23:02.480 --> 23:07.280
concerts with various friends. Most of them pay me back for the tickets I buy in advance.

23:07.280 --> 23:11.360
The trouble is the small group of friends, I particularly have trouble with some of them,

23:11.360 --> 23:16.960
the ladies, pay me back for their share of the tickets. These aren't date scenarios,

23:16.960 --> 23:22.080
more like platonic outings between members of the opposite gender who are interested in similar

23:22.080 --> 23:28.480
music. My question is, how do I get my female friends to cough up the cash or if they won't,

23:28.480 --> 23:33.280
should I just exclude them from any future outings and risk possibly losing concert buddies? That's

23:33.280 --> 23:37.200
from Cash Drop in California. I don't think- Travis, I'm going to go ahead and ask that you

23:37.200 --> 23:42.080
not chime in on this one. No, I was going to give real life advice. This is real. This is solid,

23:42.080 --> 23:48.160
straight talk. Travis has seen how the other half lives. This is my advice. I think that you need

23:48.160 --> 23:54.560
to operate like a money lending organization and that if someone establishes good credit and they

23:54.560 --> 23:58.960
pay you back for the things, then you can extend to them a line of credit in the future. But once

23:58.960 --> 24:03.520
this has failed to occur, you need to get- Break their fucking hands.

24:03.520 --> 24:05.680
No, you need to give them money upfront. Sorry.

24:05.680 --> 24:08.960
And if they want to go to the concert, you say, okay, great, it's going to be $25.

24:10.400 --> 24:13.040
And then you get that and say, great, I'll go order the tickets right now.

24:13.040 --> 24:17.120
Yeah, gender has absolutely no role in this. Regardless of the gender of your friend,

24:18.080 --> 24:21.520
if you buy them something with the understanding they'll pay you back and they don't pay you back,

24:21.520 --> 24:24.560
don't fucking buy them any more things. Next question.

24:24.560 --> 24:31.680
I'm horrible at this. I know that I am a terrible offender in this, especially if it's someone

24:31.680 --> 24:35.840
else's idea to do the concert and they're like, do you want to come? I'm like, yeah, I guess so.

24:35.840 --> 24:43.200
I feel like I'm terrible about it and I don't defend it, but I feel less obligation to pay

24:43.200 --> 24:48.160
them back quickly than if it was my idea to go. That's awful, right?

24:48.160 --> 24:50.400
Yeah, that's pretty bad. Yeah, it's bad.

24:51.440 --> 24:52.560
I'm a terrible person.

24:52.560 --> 24:58.960
I'm a terrible person. Seriously, there is no middle ground. You can either stop buying them

24:58.960 --> 25:03.280
shit and deal with the fact that they're not going to go with you, or you can pay

25:03.280 --> 25:07.520
for their company. And at that point, it's basically prostitution.

25:07.520 --> 25:09.280
Unless it's a barter system.

25:09.280 --> 25:10.480
That makes them a courtesan.

25:10.480 --> 25:15.200
Unless it's like, I get this concert, you get the next one, and that's established.

25:15.200 --> 25:16.800
But that's not what's up.

25:16.800 --> 25:19.200
But that's not what's up, you're inventing that.

25:19.200 --> 25:22.720
I know, but I'm saying maybe that's the way to go if this person, you know,

25:22.720 --> 25:26.000
if they want to go to the concert, but they don't have the $30 to pay for the ticket,

25:27.040 --> 25:29.920
then you say, okay, well, you get the next one.

25:29.920 --> 25:34.000
Or they just don't get to go to the concert. I don't want to see a bunch of fucking poor people

25:34.000 --> 25:38.080
when I'm trying to watch The Fleet Foxes, except they look like poor people.

25:38.080 --> 25:39.520
It's really hard to tell The Fleet Foxes.

25:39.520 --> 25:45.120
The only poor people I want to see are the ones that are in Cloud Cult. Other than that,

25:45.120 --> 25:48.240
if you're in the audience, you should look. You should have wine.

25:48.240 --> 25:48.800
Hide your eyes.

25:48.800 --> 25:50.880
Basically, hide your eyes, please.

25:50.880 --> 25:51.760
Your poor eyes.

25:51.760 --> 25:55.120
I was trying to think of the people, the magnetic zeros.

25:55.120 --> 25:57.600
Oh, they all look up. Oh, my God.

25:57.600 --> 26:01.680
Okay, Griffin, can you edit in there what I said Cloud Cult can be in?

26:01.680 --> 26:06.000
I'll do you one better. I will just edit in the name of a much, much cooler band.

26:06.960 --> 26:08.080
Okay, all right.

26:08.080 --> 26:13.120
You know, I was reading through Seventeen Magazine advice, like I do,

26:13.120 --> 26:17.680
and there was a question in there in which, so they have a section where people can write

26:17.680 --> 26:20.320
in to the website and then get it like crowdsource answered.

26:20.320 --> 26:23.600
Why are you pimping other advice?

26:23.600 --> 26:24.960
Oh, because it's bullshit.

26:24.960 --> 26:27.920
So then the question that the young lady had asked was,

26:27.920 --> 26:31.520
I'm going to a hipster concert, but I don't have any hipster clothes.

26:32.480 --> 26:36.160
What can I do to dress hipster with the clothes that I have

26:36.160 --> 26:39.120
and how does one act hipster at a hipster concert?

26:39.120 --> 26:39.360
Okay.

26:40.720 --> 26:44.080
And I think my favorite thing about it was that the word hipster was used 12 different times

26:44.080 --> 26:49.680
in 12 different ways. Hipster doesn't mean anything anymore.

26:49.680 --> 26:49.920
Yeah.

26:49.920 --> 26:51.280
In case anybody was curious.

26:51.280 --> 26:55.280
Justin and his friends used to think that I was a hipster because I liked Arcade Fire,

26:55.280 --> 26:57.360
but guess what? They won a fucking Grammy.

26:57.360 --> 26:58.800
So that's-

26:58.800 --> 26:59.920
So guess who's?

26:59.920 --> 27:00.640
Guess who's?

27:00.640 --> 27:01.840
Well, I don't understand your point.

27:03.520 --> 27:07.840
It's like, I don't know, it seems like you'd be like,

27:07.840 --> 27:10.560
you're a hipster because you listen to Neil Young.

27:10.560 --> 27:12.000
Like, yep, sure do.

27:12.000 --> 27:15.280
Whoopi Goldberg won a Grammy. Like, what are you saying?

27:15.280 --> 27:15.840
I'm saying-

27:15.840 --> 27:16.800
It means nothing.

27:16.800 --> 27:18.240
That's precisely what I'm saying.

27:19.120 --> 27:21.840
They are in the same class as Whoopi goddamn Goldberg

27:22.480 --> 27:24.320
and there's nothing hip about what-

27:24.320 --> 27:28.960
There hasn't been anything hip about Whoopi Goldberg since fucking Sister Act 2.

27:30.240 --> 27:31.120
God, that was a good flip though.

27:31.120 --> 27:32.400
Fuck yeah, it was.

27:32.400 --> 27:34.960
I mean, she had a cameo in the Little Rascals movie. That was pretty good.

27:34.960 --> 27:37.200
She was looking good in Sister Act 2.

27:38.400 --> 27:40.400
She is a woman.

27:40.400 --> 27:41.200
That's all I'll say.

27:41.200 --> 27:43.280
And I love when she played the goalie in Mighty Ducks.

27:44.080 --> 27:46.240
A few weeks ago, one of the guys in my dorm-

27:46.240 --> 27:47.760
Hold on, hold the fucking phone.

27:49.760 --> 27:52.400
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

27:52.400 --> 27:54.880
I was just hoping I could drop that one and then move on.

27:54.880 --> 27:55.840
I was trying to.

27:55.840 --> 27:56.160
Travis-

27:56.160 --> 27:56.400
Thank you, Justin.

27:56.400 --> 27:57.440
I couldn't let it stand.

27:57.440 --> 28:01.920
I'm gonna give you 15 seconds to either apologize or explain-

28:01.920 --> 28:02.880
Wait, I can explain it.

28:02.880 --> 28:03.380
Okay.

28:04.480 --> 28:07.600
Because the goalie in Mighty Ducks is named Goldberg.

28:07.600 --> 28:08.000
Thank you.

28:08.000 --> 28:10.880
Yeah, that's all Travis's brain has.

28:10.880 --> 28:14.160
It's like, it sounded like reptilian instinct at this point.

28:14.160 --> 28:17.600
Yeah, he's gotta jump from one ledge to the next so quickly that I can't even keep up with it.

28:17.600 --> 28:18.960
It just has no time.

28:18.960 --> 28:22.960
It can't stop to survey the comedy scenery.

28:22.960 --> 28:24.640
Listen, the ground is lava.

28:24.640 --> 28:25.760
I can't even stop.

28:25.760 --> 28:27.040
I just gotta keep moving.

28:27.040 --> 28:31.040
Travis is like Pippi Longstocking avoiding the black tiles in his kitchen.

28:31.040 --> 28:33.760
He's just leaping moment to moment.

28:34.800 --> 28:35.520
You stopped.

28:35.520 --> 28:40.000
I was trying to drive the train on and I was throwing a vine across the ravine so he could

28:40.000 --> 28:42.720
swing on and you were just snipping it from above.

28:44.000 --> 28:44.800
Thank you, Justin.

28:44.800 --> 28:46.240
Like in Donkey Kong Jr.

28:47.680 --> 28:52.480
Hey, a few weeks ago, one of the guys in my dorm asked me out.

28:52.480 --> 28:53.520
I said no.

28:54.240 --> 28:57.040
Not looking for a relationship right now, especially not with him.

28:57.760 --> 29:02.720
After I friendzoned him, he began following me.

29:03.280 --> 29:04.480
I go to the cafeteria.

29:04.480 --> 29:05.920
He comes too.

29:05.920 --> 29:08.800
He bought a wow subscription after he saw that I had one.

29:09.440 --> 29:15.680
He texted me five times in an hour while I was at an indie games festival asking me where

29:15.680 --> 29:18.960
I was and when he found me, he followed me for the rest of the day.

29:18.960 --> 29:20.160
My dorm mates him inform me.

29:20.160 --> 29:23.120
He comes to our room and asks where I am more than a few times a week.

29:23.120 --> 29:25.200
I'm seriously freaked out by him.

29:25.200 --> 29:26.160
What should I do?

29:26.160 --> 29:27.200
That's from OMG.

29:28.000 --> 29:29.360
Leave me alone.

29:31.280 --> 29:31.680
Fuck.

29:31.680 --> 29:33.040
Well, he's baby ducked to you.

29:33.040 --> 29:33.600
He did.

29:35.920 --> 29:37.520
Yeah, you've been baby ducked.

29:37.520 --> 29:38.160
I'm sorry.

29:38.160 --> 29:43.600
When you say it, this is potentially felonious what this man is doing, but when you describe

29:43.600 --> 29:45.440
it that way, it's almost adorable.

29:46.160 --> 29:47.520
Yeah, he's imprinted on you.

29:47.520 --> 29:48.080
Mm-hmm.

29:48.800 --> 30:00.080
You sound like the sort of person who is probably too nice to lay down the law in the way it

30:00.080 --> 30:09.040
needs to be laid down like you need to not be ambiguous or too kind about this.

30:09.040 --> 30:10.320
You need to shut it down.

30:10.320 --> 30:13.200
You need to full-blown justified this kid.

30:14.160 --> 30:21.200
Yes, you need to go all the font on this fool and you can't worry about this person's feelings

30:21.200 --> 30:25.200
because they don't care enough about your feelings to not take you to skived out town.

30:25.200 --> 30:25.680
Yep.

30:25.680 --> 30:26.960
Like you've got to shut it down.

30:26.960 --> 30:33.680
Because the friend zone is like the polite penalty box.

30:33.680 --> 30:34.160
You know what I mean?

30:34.160 --> 30:35.040
You're not out of the game.

30:35.040 --> 30:36.080
You haven't been thrown out.

30:37.200 --> 30:40.240
I thought we weren't going to use that term anymore because it's fucking stupid.

30:40.240 --> 30:43.520
If you decide to be friends with someone who has asked you on a date and you said no and

30:43.520 --> 30:47.360
they've shown like you're saying no, but I do want to be friends with you.

30:47.360 --> 30:48.000
Guess what?

30:48.000 --> 30:49.520
You don't want to be friends with this person.

30:50.240 --> 30:51.200
That's the thing, right?

30:51.200 --> 30:55.600
And that's why the friend zone is so is erroneous as an idea.

30:55.600 --> 30:59.520
I mean, either you're friends with somebody or you're in a relationship with somebody.

30:59.520 --> 31:01.840
You want neither from this person.

31:01.840 --> 31:05.120
You want them to be in the, you don't want to put them in the friend zone.

31:05.120 --> 31:06.800
You want to put them in the phantom zone.

31:09.040 --> 31:10.720
You want them gone for good.

31:12.480 --> 31:18.640
I think you just need to be straight up with this dude and be like, hey, listen, you're

31:18.640 --> 31:22.320
skiving me out and I think that we need to not speak.

31:22.320 --> 31:23.120
Just straight up.

31:23.120 --> 31:26.640
Tell him, hey, I know that what you think you're doing is super charming, but do you

31:26.640 --> 31:30.400
know how no love story has ever started?

31:30.400 --> 31:31.120
Never.

31:31.120 --> 31:31.760
Not ever.

31:32.320 --> 31:33.920
This thing you're doing.

31:33.920 --> 31:34.880
This is it.

31:34.880 --> 31:36.240
That has never happened.

31:36.240 --> 31:40.320
You know, hey, did you ever see that scene in the notebook where the guy did this thing

31:40.320 --> 31:41.120
that you're doing to me?

31:41.120 --> 31:42.640
Oh, you didn't because it was deleted.

31:42.640 --> 31:43.520
Oh, it wasn't deleted.

31:43.520 --> 31:45.920
It was never filmed because it's fucking skeevy.

31:47.440 --> 31:48.640
Skeevy Nix.

31:48.640 --> 31:49.920
Why don't you just call him Skeevy Nix?

31:51.040 --> 31:52.400
Back off, Skeevy Nix.

31:52.400 --> 31:54.240
Skeevy Martin, get out of here.

31:54.240 --> 31:55.680
Skeevy Martin.

31:55.680 --> 31:58.480
You guys, you know whose fault this is, right?

31:58.480 --> 32:01.040
The fault for this.

32:01.040 --> 32:02.000
Thank you, Travis.

32:02.000 --> 32:02.240
Yes.

32:02.800 --> 32:12.560
You take the boom box scene, the perennial symbol of unrequited love for our generation.

32:12.560 --> 32:20.240
You take out in your eyes and you replace it with like old Fortuna or some shit and he's

32:20.240 --> 32:21.040
a stalker.

32:21.040 --> 32:24.880
Yes, there's one of two circumstances going on here.

32:24.880 --> 32:29.360
He thinks he's being incredibly charming and has no point of reference for the fact that

32:29.360 --> 32:34.720
he is actually creeping on you and being a stalker or two, he is stalking you and has

32:34.720 --> 32:35.920
some serious problems.

32:35.920 --> 32:38.640
Either way, you need to ditch this fool.

32:39.280 --> 32:40.640
Yeah, you need to shut it.

32:40.640 --> 32:48.480
You need to tell him directly and you need to start taking steps to like you really need

32:48.480 --> 32:50.480
to extricate yourself from the situation.

32:50.480 --> 32:55.840
This is not healthy and it's not whether or not this guy's like a complete and total

32:55.840 --> 32:59.360
weird beard or just like a misdirected youth.

32:59.360 --> 33:05.520
Like you need to be very direct in the situation and take steps to.

33:07.360 --> 33:09.760
Because clearly this person does not pick up subtle cues.

33:09.760 --> 33:10.800
No, right.

33:10.800 --> 33:11.280
That's it.

33:11.280 --> 33:12.880
I mean, they don't pick up subtle cues.

33:12.880 --> 33:14.640
You have to be direct.

33:14.640 --> 33:15.280
Shut it down.

33:16.320 --> 33:20.080
Hey, do you guys ever think about that scene from Say Anything and think about how well

33:20.080 --> 33:26.000
he threaded the needle because there's literally no other song that he could have played that

33:26.000 --> 33:30.320
would have made that scenario swing the way that it did.

33:30.320 --> 33:31.360
Swing in his favor.

33:32.720 --> 33:34.160
Yeah, it's pretty.

33:34.160 --> 33:38.080
If he had busted out like Tarzan Boy.

33:39.440 --> 33:40.400
Oh, man.

33:40.400 --> 33:40.960
Do you think that?

33:41.600 --> 33:42.560
No, no, no.

33:42.560 --> 33:43.280
I'm sorry.

33:43.280 --> 33:48.160
If someone's blaring Tarzan Boy from a boombox, I may not get into a serious relationship

33:48.160 --> 33:50.400
with them, but we are going to go have a party.

33:50.400 --> 33:50.960
Yeah, sure.

33:50.960 --> 33:52.400
We are going to go party together.

33:54.560 --> 33:55.680
That's like a Jungle Rhythm.

33:55.680 --> 33:56.160
You can't.

33:56.160 --> 33:58.400
You really can't deny it.

33:58.400 --> 34:00.400
You can't deny him in that.

34:00.400 --> 34:05.360
Did you know on Spotify there's a six and a half minute version of Jungle Boy that was

34:05.360 --> 34:07.920
on the official LP, the Jungle Boy.

34:07.920 --> 34:12.080
It's called Tarzan Boy Summer Edition and it's six and a half minutes long.

34:12.080 --> 34:13.760
So oh my God.

34:13.760 --> 34:18.000
Yeah, that's enough to that's enough to I mean, you can just put it on repeat.

34:18.000 --> 34:19.040
And then let me think.

34:19.040 --> 34:20.080
Let me do the math real quick.

34:20.080 --> 34:21.440
Ten times in an hour.

34:22.080 --> 34:22.640
Twenty four hours.

34:22.640 --> 34:25.920
So you could listen to it 240 times and that's your whole day.

34:25.920 --> 34:28.480
And unlike the 239th time, you've won her heart.

34:29.280 --> 34:29.600
Yeah.

34:29.600 --> 34:30.960
So just camp out there, brother.

34:30.960 --> 34:31.600
Yeah.

34:31.600 --> 34:32.100
Yeah.

34:32.720 --> 34:34.800
Guys, can everybody just stop?

34:35.600 --> 34:44.400
Can we stop following people and thinking that this is like this is a message to every

34:44.400 --> 34:48.160
man who has bought into the Cusack lie.

34:48.160 --> 34:55.360
OK, following a woman around incessantly is not going to win them over.

34:55.360 --> 34:57.840
It's not how we're not going to melt their hearts.

34:57.840 --> 34:58.640
It's not how it works.

34:58.640 --> 34:59.360
Here's how it works.

34:59.360 --> 35:00.080
You ready?

35:00.080 --> 35:01.600
Hey, you seem fun.

35:01.600 --> 35:03.040
You want to go on a date sometime?

35:03.040 --> 35:03.600
No.

35:03.600 --> 35:05.120
OK, cool later.

35:05.120 --> 35:05.760
Talk to you.

35:05.760 --> 35:06.080
Never.

35:06.080 --> 35:09.600
It's not like I had a big conversation with a friend of mine yesterday where he was saying

35:09.600 --> 35:13.840
that there was this girl that was interested in and he didn't know how to let her down.

35:13.840 --> 35:16.160
And I said, just tell her you're not interested.

35:16.160 --> 35:17.680
And he said, well, I did that.

35:17.680 --> 35:20.240
And she asked me why not and got in this big discussion.

35:20.240 --> 35:26.160
Hey, everyone, if someone says they're not interested in you, no good comes from trying

35:26.160 --> 35:26.720
to convince them.

35:26.720 --> 35:30.640
When you say that you're going to when you say that you're like you responded that by

35:30.640 --> 35:34.480
saying that you're going to whittle them down, it makes you sound like John Wayne fucking

35:34.480 --> 35:34.980
Gacy.

35:35.680 --> 35:36.000
Yeah.

35:36.000 --> 35:41.600
And at the very best, I mean, the very best you break this person's spirit and you spend

35:41.600 --> 35:46.480
the rest of the relationship with them, kowtowing to them and like working your ass off to try

35:46.480 --> 35:49.840
not to upset them because of how hard you worked at it.

35:49.840 --> 35:51.360
It's like terrible.

35:51.360 --> 35:52.480
You are it.

35:52.480 --> 35:53.120
Stop it.

35:53.120 --> 35:55.840
Every guy, girls, I don't think are at women.

35:55.840 --> 35:56.880
I don't think are as bad.

35:56.880 --> 35:58.560
I would say it's probably nine to 10.

35:58.560 --> 35:59.280
The split.

35:59.280 --> 36:03.200
Ninety ten, probably because women have like self-respect.

36:03.200 --> 36:03.680
Yes.

36:03.680 --> 36:08.640
So if someone says I'm not interested in you, say to yourself in your head, all right, I

36:08.640 --> 36:12.720
then it's probably time to move on and find someone that is interested in me.

36:12.720 --> 36:17.520
And and with this horse, this this friend zone horseshit, if you want to be friends with

36:17.520 --> 36:19.200
a woman, be friends with them.

36:19.200 --> 36:19.440
Yes.

36:19.440 --> 36:23.200
If you want to be in a relationship with them, ask them to go on a date with you.

36:23.200 --> 36:30.000
Don't start a friendship with someone under the under the completely misguided assumption

36:30.000 --> 36:33.920
that you're going to say something during your friendship where they'll realize you've

36:33.920 --> 36:35.200
been there all along.

36:35.200 --> 36:37.840
You know, you know who else has been there all along?

36:37.840 --> 36:39.440
Fucking a stalker.

36:39.440 --> 36:44.400
My friend said to me he was talking about how he was not physically or romantically

36:44.400 --> 36:45.520
interested in this woman.

36:45.520 --> 36:48.480
And he said, but, you know, I am emotionally I could see it working.

36:48.480 --> 36:50.000
I said, that's called friendship.

36:50.640 --> 36:54.960
Like if you are emotionally connected to someone, but there is not a physical or romantic

36:54.960 --> 36:57.200
attachment, that's called friendship, you guys.

36:57.760 --> 36:59.680
Yes, of course, the person feels special.

36:59.680 --> 37:00.800
They're your friend.

37:00.800 --> 37:01.680
They're your friend.

37:01.680 --> 37:10.320
And if they're not attracted to you and you you like pursue them hoping to melt the the

37:10.320 --> 37:16.720
iceberg of repulsion that they feel towards you, that ends up with you wasting your valuable

37:16.720 --> 37:19.360
time, your your youth.

37:19.360 --> 37:19.920
Stop it.

37:19.920 --> 37:22.800
And I can say this because I did that in college.

37:22.800 --> 37:23.840
Everyone's done that.

37:23.840 --> 37:28.880
There's been someone that they felt well, no, you think I've ever had a God among men.

37:28.880 --> 37:32.320
You think I've ever had a problem getting this dick wet.

37:32.320 --> 37:36.000
OK, all right, let's let's go.

37:36.000 --> 37:36.720
Let's get real.

37:37.280 --> 37:38.560
Hey, listen, I'm getting your dick.

37:38.560 --> 37:38.880
No, no, no.

37:38.880 --> 37:39.200
Hold on.

37:39.200 --> 37:39.600
Hold on.

37:40.160 --> 37:44.720
Before we make our awkward transition in the money zone, I just want to say you can disavow

37:44.720 --> 37:46.480
everything we just say if it's true love.

37:47.680 --> 37:50.400
Griffin, well, of course, it's true love.

37:50.960 --> 37:53.760
If it's true love, you got work for it.

37:54.720 --> 37:58.800
Griffin, Griffin, it's that kind of statement that all of the

37:58.800 --> 38:00.560
good guys true love.

38:00.560 --> 38:04.960
Maybe maybe she's the the the canvas on which you'll paint your masterpiece.

38:04.960 --> 38:05.520
You love me.

38:05.520 --> 38:11.840
It's really hard to say, but but if it's you can listen to us for matters of the brain.

38:11.840 --> 38:14.960
But when it comes to matters of the heart, it's got to take precedent.

38:14.960 --> 38:20.960
So like if you just got it, Griffin and then Griffin poisons the well.

38:20.960 --> 38:25.440
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, money zone.

38:38.160 --> 38:44.800
I don't I paid the rights to to Baltimore to bust out Tarzan Boyd there.

38:44.800 --> 38:49.120
It was a fair use under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.

38:49.120 --> 38:50.160
Yeah.

38:50.160 --> 38:53.680
You know, get the girl is only half the trick.

38:53.680 --> 38:55.520
The other half is keeping her.

38:55.520 --> 38:58.720
And how do you keep the fire alive in the bedroom?

38:58.720 --> 38:59.520
You ask.

38:59.520 --> 39:01.200
You chain them to the wall.

39:01.200 --> 39:02.080
Let's pretend.

39:02.080 --> 39:09.760
Well, that's an option, Travis, with the extreme restraints.com is is your one stop

39:09.760 --> 39:16.160
super shop for pop tops and 50 Shades of Grey related items.

39:16.160 --> 39:16.960
They got that now.

39:16.960 --> 39:17.600
Did you know that?

39:17.600 --> 39:21.120
That items inspired by 50 Shades of Grey.

39:21.120 --> 39:22.960
Hey, this looks like a crazy book.

39:22.960 --> 39:25.280
Yeah, I'm looking at the things that is.

39:26.240 --> 39:30.480
This seems like kind of a crazy one of the items inspired by 50 Shades of Grey is the

39:30.480 --> 39:34.880
book 50 Shades of Grey, which you see that and you're like, well, yes, but what you don't

39:34.880 --> 39:37.120
know is that it feels good to spank with.

39:38.400 --> 39:40.560
It's got a nice your dick inside the book.

39:40.560 --> 39:46.080
It's got this carved out hole in between the papyrus and just rub on it.

39:46.080 --> 39:48.160
You're going to love the way this book feels.

39:48.160 --> 39:52.320
All the pages are made out of puff plus with lotion and it feels lovely in there.

39:54.400 --> 39:59.120
You got they've got some Thai jelly anal beads.

40:01.520 --> 40:07.600
I would probably keep all but related beads to American produce products.

40:07.600 --> 40:08.160
I'm not sure.

40:09.280 --> 40:11.440
I'm not sure that I would go to Thailand for things.

40:11.440 --> 40:15.040
Now, because you put five in and four come out and then all of a sudden that's your whole

40:15.040 --> 40:16.960
day, your whole day is about that now.

40:18.000 --> 40:22.160
You should also you should also probably get a special drawer for that kind of thing.

40:22.160 --> 40:22.640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

40:23.200 --> 40:24.000
You don't want to mix it up.

40:24.000 --> 40:27.680
And if you have kids, please make it a high drawer, please.

40:28.320 --> 40:28.960
They don't need this.

40:28.960 --> 40:31.040
I'm with some kind of child safety lock on it.

40:31.760 --> 40:35.600
I'm looking at a gentleman wearing elbow length latex gloves.

40:35.600 --> 40:36.800
That's an option.

40:36.800 --> 40:39.040
And actually in this picture is flipping me off.

40:39.040 --> 40:40.480
So I don't know where I went wrong.

40:40.480 --> 40:40.880
No, no, no.

40:40.880 --> 40:43.680
You don't understand that finger has a purpose.

40:43.680 --> 40:45.200
Oh, it's going somewhere.

40:46.000 --> 40:47.440
It's going somewhere wonderful.

40:48.880 --> 40:52.640
They've got a water bottle douche kid here, which is ironic because I think everyone carrying

40:52.640 --> 40:54.480
a water bottle around is kind of a douche.

40:55.440 --> 40:57.680
We make a we get we get it.

40:57.680 --> 41:00.640
OK, we get we have a good time here on my brother, my brother and me.

41:00.640 --> 41:05.440
But these these sex aids, by which I mean the things that help you have sex.

41:06.960 --> 41:08.160
They're they're valuable.

41:08.160 --> 41:12.800
They're they're precious treasures and they're going to shake things up in a way that you

41:12.800 --> 41:14.640
don't even understand right now.

41:14.640 --> 41:15.440
You're scared of them.

41:15.440 --> 41:16.640
You might be scared.

41:16.640 --> 41:18.000
Just make take the leap.

41:18.000 --> 41:21.600
You know who also scared Christopher Columbus and he discovered America.

41:22.560 --> 41:23.520
Oh, my God.

41:23.520 --> 41:26.800
I'm discovering your America of fucking an extremist.

41:26.800 --> 41:29.440
You may think that you're going to India, but what's that?

41:29.440 --> 41:31.520
It's your asshole and it's blown out.

41:33.760 --> 41:35.040
You should have trained it before.

41:35.040 --> 41:36.320
Actually, super blew out.

41:36.320 --> 41:36.800
You got that.

41:36.800 --> 41:40.320
You got to train it with these special gauged butt plugs.

41:40.320 --> 41:41.760
You're going to love the way it feels.

41:41.760 --> 41:43.200
You're going to love the way it feels.

41:43.840 --> 41:45.360
It's you're going to like the way you look.

41:47.680 --> 41:52.080
You may be looking for for spices, for exotic spices.

41:52.080 --> 41:56.720
Instead, what you're going to find is that things happen when things rub up against your

41:56.720 --> 41:57.680
prostate.

41:57.680 --> 41:58.480
Back to you guys.

42:00.960 --> 42:06.160
So go to extremistchase.com and you can use the coupon code middle list and you'll save

42:06.160 --> 42:07.200
20 percent.

42:07.200 --> 42:12.720
You could save 20 percent on the forced orgasm tower, which is what I call my dorm.

42:12.720 --> 42:15.680
Like you guys, I know that we've been doing extremistchase.com

42:16.640 --> 42:19.920
promos for the last couple of weeks now, so maybe it's turned into like white noise when

42:19.920 --> 42:21.040
you get to the money zone.

42:21.040 --> 42:24.560
I'm telling you, if you haven't gone yet, if you haven't checked it out, there is something

42:24.560 --> 42:30.400
there for you and maybe two things there for you and maybe some weird things there for you.

42:30.400 --> 42:37.280
But not it's only weird to us because we're total missionary style prudes.

42:37.280 --> 42:37.760
Right.

42:37.760 --> 42:40.640
Baptist household prudos.

42:41.360 --> 42:43.360
Hey, how about a yahoo?

42:43.360 --> 42:45.120
Griffin, I was going to ask you for a yahoo.

42:45.120 --> 42:49.040
We're going to read another question because you're trying to fucking bogart the show with

42:49.040 --> 42:49.760
your normies.

42:49.760 --> 42:53.120
Guys, read both at the same time.

42:53.120 --> 42:53.920
Here we go.

42:53.920 --> 42:56.800
This yahoo answer is recently found out what we're not really doing.

42:56.800 --> 42:58.880
This is sent in by Krista Whalen.

42:58.880 --> 43:00.400
Thanks, Krista.

43:00.400 --> 43:01.200
You know it's good.

43:01.200 --> 43:03.040
That's like the Nintendo seal of quality.

43:04.800 --> 43:08.800
It's by yahoo answers user Chris who asks, what is the hole on the penis called?

43:08.800 --> 43:09.440
Travis, do you?

43:11.440 --> 43:12.400
I do know.

43:12.400 --> 43:12.960
Do you really?

43:14.000 --> 43:15.120
I mean, it's the urethra.

43:15.120 --> 43:15.440
Nope.

43:16.320 --> 43:17.920
Yeah, nope, nope.

43:17.920 --> 43:22.160
Their urethra is the tube that connects the penis hole to the piss bag.

43:24.000 --> 43:28.720
The hole in the tip of the penis is called the

43:28.720 --> 43:30.560
debt ceiling.

43:30.560 --> 43:31.920
Is your penis not?

43:33.360 --> 43:35.040
It's technically called the debt ceiling.

43:35.040 --> 43:37.760
That's why they're always talking about raising the debt ceiling.

43:37.760 --> 43:38.080
Right.

43:38.080 --> 43:41.600
That's why it was such a kerfuffle and a little racy.

43:41.600 --> 43:43.360
That's why it was such a hot button issue.

43:44.400 --> 43:48.400
That is sort of the colloquial name if we want to know the...

43:48.400 --> 43:54.960
Because I took one anatomy class in high school that I did not do very well in.

43:54.960 --> 44:01.600
And the scientific name for like scientists, what they refer to it is the front anus.

44:02.880 --> 44:03.920
The front anus.

44:04.480 --> 44:05.360
Interesting.

44:05.360 --> 44:07.360
I always thought it was the maw.

44:07.360 --> 44:08.640
Is it not the maw?

44:08.640 --> 44:16.240
Well, it can if you have the special mutation that turns it sentient,

44:16.240 --> 44:18.080
then that is technically what it's called.

44:19.200 --> 44:21.280
I've always just called mine big mouth billy bass.

44:21.280 --> 44:21.520
Okay.

44:22.160 --> 44:22.480
Okay.

44:23.680 --> 44:24.560
Good, good.

44:24.560 --> 44:32.720
Hey, if you at home have ever made your penis hole like a mouth and used it to talk to yourself,

44:32.720 --> 44:35.360
go ahead and write into the show and let us know what happened.

44:35.360 --> 44:38.880
And then apply to work at puppetry of the penis because you're well on your way.

44:38.880 --> 44:41.280
Don't let me feel so alone anymore.

44:41.280 --> 44:43.920
For a long time, that's what I hoped puppetry of the penis was.

44:43.920 --> 44:46.800
That it wasn't like, look, I turned my dick into Loch Ness Monster or something.

44:46.800 --> 44:49.040
That it was like Sesame Street with dicks.

44:50.080 --> 44:50.880
So hold on.

44:52.000 --> 44:52.480
So wait.

44:52.480 --> 44:59.920
They manipulated the urethral opening into so it looks like mouths

44:59.920 --> 45:04.000
and then they sang like show tunes and shit, like Sin and the Clowns?

45:04.000 --> 45:07.840
Well, in my mind, they were doing songs mostly from Little Shop of Horrors.

45:07.840 --> 45:09.040
Like feed me.

45:09.040 --> 45:09.520
Yeah.

45:09.520 --> 45:10.320
Well, don't feed him.

45:11.280 --> 45:11.760
No.

45:11.760 --> 45:12.320
God, no.

45:12.960 --> 45:14.400
Unless you go to ExtremeRestraints.com.

45:14.400 --> 45:14.880
Stop.

45:15.440 --> 45:15.840
Okay.

45:15.840 --> 45:16.160
Okay.

45:18.880 --> 45:19.520
It's called the-

45:19.520 --> 45:21.760
There's a whole weird Chuck Palahniuk book about that, by the way.

45:21.760 --> 45:22.240
Hey, guys.

45:23.120 --> 45:23.600
What's it called?

45:23.600 --> 45:24.240
It's called the me-

45:24.240 --> 45:24.960
I don't know what it's called.

45:24.960 --> 45:29.200
I read a section of it in Playboy once where he was like putting wax shit into his penis.

45:29.200 --> 45:31.360
Travis, I mean what the hole is called.

45:34.880 --> 45:35.520
Go ahead, Griffin.

45:36.480 --> 45:37.600
It's just called hole.

45:39.760 --> 45:40.160
Okay.

45:40.160 --> 45:41.040
No, it's called the-

45:41.040 --> 45:42.000
It's called meatus.

45:42.960 --> 45:44.000
M-E-A-T-U-S.

45:44.000 --> 45:51.840
That- Wasn't that the nerdy friend on Boy Meets The World?

45:51.840 --> 45:52.320
He'd be like,

45:54.960 --> 45:56.800
meatus, can we copy your Spanish homework?

46:01.200 --> 46:02.880
Wait, why is it a sandworm?

46:03.440 --> 46:06.080
If you look into it, it's like staring into the mouth of Cthulhu.

46:08.960 --> 46:12.240
Man, we did not get as much mileage out of that question as I would have hoped.

46:12.240 --> 46:14.400
So, here's my question.

46:14.400 --> 46:16.560
I want to ask you guys on the show because hopefully-

46:17.120 --> 46:19.280
So, the hole at the tip is called the meatus, right?

46:19.280 --> 46:19.780
Uh-huh.

46:20.560 --> 46:22.000
What's the other hole called?

46:22.560 --> 46:24.320
The one that's going in sideways?

46:26.160 --> 46:26.880
I don't know, Justin.

46:28.080 --> 46:31.920
Yeah, it's about an inch below that one and it's like a sideways hole that goes through

46:32.560 --> 46:33.200
to the other-

46:33.200 --> 46:33.680
What's that?

46:33.680 --> 46:35.440
So, you know how you could-

46:35.440 --> 46:38.080
You know how when you pee it comes out three ways?

46:38.080 --> 46:38.480
Sure.

46:38.480 --> 46:38.720
What is-

46:38.720 --> 46:39.440
Like a glaive.

46:39.440 --> 46:40.480
What is the hole-

46:40.480 --> 46:41.200
Like a glaive.

46:41.200 --> 46:42.800
What is the other hole called?

46:44.800 --> 46:45.680
It's called-

46:46.560 --> 46:47.060
Okay.

46:48.560 --> 46:50.000
I believe that's a Prince Albert.

46:51.680 --> 46:54.480
Travis, it's time that we tell Justin.

46:55.360 --> 46:55.860
Yes.

46:57.120 --> 46:57.600
Tell me what?

46:57.600 --> 46:59.760
About the thing from our childhood.

47:02.800 --> 47:04.080
I don't remember anything from our childhood.

47:04.080 --> 47:04.480
No, it's-

47:04.480 --> 47:05.280
You blocked it out.

47:05.280 --> 47:08.640
It was before you were born and-

47:08.640 --> 47:09.140
Okay.

47:09.140 --> 47:13.540
Well, no, I guess it had to be after you were born because it would be hard to really get

47:13.540 --> 47:15.460
in there in vitro.

47:15.460 --> 47:16.260
Sure, sure, sure.

47:16.260 --> 47:19.700
But something happened to your penis that was really funny.

47:21.140 --> 47:21.700
What was it?

47:24.100 --> 47:25.460
It was really funny.

47:25.460 --> 47:30.980
It was like they were doing the circumcision.

47:30.980 --> 47:31.860
They were bracing you.

47:33.540 --> 47:33.940
Okay.

47:33.940 --> 47:39.860
And let's just say that a crazy man ran into the room and stabbed your dick.

47:41.860 --> 47:43.620
It had nothing to do with the bris.

47:43.620 --> 47:45.060
It was just that your dick was already out.

47:45.060 --> 47:50.980
Your dick was on the table and a crazy man just ran into the room.

47:50.980 --> 47:51.780
He's like, what are you-

47:51.780 --> 47:53.460
Yelling, Baba Booey, Baba Booey.

47:53.460 --> 47:56.420
And then he's like, hey, you bracing?

47:56.420 --> 48:00.420
And then he pulled out an ice pick and he stabbed your baby dick.

48:02.420 --> 48:03.140
Man, I hope.

48:03.140 --> 48:03.460
I hope.

48:03.460 --> 48:04.260
I will say this, though.

48:04.820 --> 48:06.260
The laughter was deafening.

48:06.260 --> 48:07.700
Like everyone got it right away.

48:07.700 --> 48:08.180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

48:08.180 --> 48:15.220
Like when he planted it firmly into the table and it was like inside your baby dick.

48:15.220 --> 48:18.340
Like this ice pick was like inside your baby dick just like grinding away.

48:18.340 --> 48:21.940
And it was kind of doing that like, you know, something vibrates after you stab it into the

48:21.940 --> 48:21.940
table.

48:21.940 --> 48:23.300
I don't remember any of that.

48:23.300 --> 48:24.340
Well, no, you're a baby.

48:24.340 --> 48:27.460
And then the nurse was like, you know, fighting tears of laughter.

48:27.460 --> 48:30.020
Like, we got to do something or this kid's going to lose his dick.

48:30.020 --> 48:34.260
Tell me at least, tell me at least our parents friend zoned the guy.

48:34.260 --> 48:34.580
Yeah.

48:34.580 --> 48:34.980
Oh, yeah.

48:34.980 --> 48:38.820
They were like, you can't come over here anymore.

48:39.780 --> 48:40.820
Now, here's my question.

48:40.820 --> 48:41.940
I think the obvious question.

48:42.660 --> 48:44.420
Why did they tell you and not me?

48:45.060 --> 48:46.740
Oh, we laughed about it for days.

48:46.740 --> 48:47.540
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

48:47.540 --> 48:48.340
You weren't alive.

48:48.340 --> 48:49.060
You weren't alive.

48:49.060 --> 48:49.460
You weren't alive.

48:49.460 --> 48:56.100
When I think about this crazy stranger running into the room and stabbing you, you're so

48:56.100 --> 49:00.180
vulnerable, just stabbing your baby dick right through it.

49:01.060 --> 49:01.380
Like it.

49:03.220 --> 49:04.900
It's chuckle city, to be honest.

49:07.460 --> 49:09.860
Oh, God, it never gets old either.

49:09.860 --> 49:12.500
You know, I don't understand.

49:14.020 --> 49:15.220
How do you understand?

49:15.860 --> 49:17.220
Why would he do that to me?

49:17.220 --> 49:18.100
It's hilarious.

49:18.100 --> 49:19.620
Because it was Gallagher.

49:21.940 --> 49:25.460
Do you remember when Gallagher Gallagher was really I do remember it was before he

49:25.460 --> 49:29.940
discovered like his watermelon thing and he was trying to look for and he would show up

49:29.940 --> 49:31.940
at hospitals and parents would be like, fuck.

49:32.500 --> 49:36.260
And then he'd be like, hey, hey, time to stab some baby dicks.

49:36.260 --> 49:37.380
And then he would just do it.

49:37.940 --> 49:41.140
He would do like three or four in one go because he was a busy guy.

49:41.140 --> 49:44.340
So like he wanted to get as much mileage out of each hospital visit.

49:44.340 --> 49:45.620
But he was workshopping.

49:45.620 --> 49:47.460
I mean, you can't blame he was workshop.

49:47.460 --> 49:48.500
Don't heckle.

49:48.500 --> 49:50.180
He was trying to work out a bit.

49:50.180 --> 49:54.100
This actually makes a lot of sense because I've never found Gallagher very funny.

49:54.100 --> 49:58.820
And I've always wondered why it was you have a deep seated memory of when Gallagher came

49:58.820 --> 50:00.900
through and definitely stabbed you in the dick.

50:01.620 --> 50:03.380
This is not liable because it's true.

50:04.420 --> 50:05.700
No doubt about it, folks.

50:05.700 --> 50:07.460
It ain't liable if it's true.

50:07.460 --> 50:09.300
That's what Muhammad Ali said.

50:09.300 --> 50:13.780
Hey, I recently found what I thought was a really cool, unique watch and immediately

50:13.780 --> 50:14.280
bought it.

50:14.980 --> 50:16.900
I think it fits my style and personality.

50:16.900 --> 50:21.860
But the first three friends I showed it to had slightly negative reactions to it and

50:21.860 --> 50:24.180
didn't understand what was so excited about.

50:24.180 --> 50:29.220
Should I shrug it off or should I take this as a cue to reevaluate my choice of fashion?

50:29.220 --> 50:32.100
I still like the watch, but it seems I'm the only one.

50:32.740 --> 50:35.060
That's from Fearful of Fashion faux pas.

50:35.060 --> 50:36.180
Here's a link to the watch.

50:36.180 --> 50:37.220
I'm not going to click it.

50:37.220 --> 50:39.140
I'm not going to click it before I give this advice.

50:40.740 --> 50:42.500
This is what your watch should look like.

50:43.300 --> 50:47.140
A round face with either a leather or steel.

50:47.140 --> 50:50.020
The strap doesn't fucking matter as long as it's not goofy.

50:50.020 --> 50:54.180
And then there's 12 numbers on it and there's two hands that go around and tell you what

50:54.180 --> 50:55.700
the time is on the watch.

50:56.260 --> 50:58.980
That's fashion point number one.

50:58.980 --> 51:04.020
If it's like a bunch of LED lights that only you can read because it's in binary, then

51:04.020 --> 51:05.940
you done fucked up somewhere.

51:05.940 --> 51:07.860
I'm going to be honest with you, friend, though.

51:07.860 --> 51:09.700
I'm looking at the picture of the watch.

51:09.700 --> 51:12.100
I don't know what it means.

51:12.100 --> 51:16.740
If it shoots a hologram into the sky and then you have to read it on the ceiling, then you

51:16.740 --> 51:20.100
have you have slipped up somewhere fashion wise.

51:20.900 --> 51:26.660
In my opinion, as a fashion item, as a bracelet, it's very good looking.

51:26.660 --> 51:29.780
As a functional timepiece, I don't understand.

51:29.780 --> 51:34.500
If you can play a Tiger Electronics game on it, then whoopsie.

51:34.500 --> 51:35.940
You goofed.

51:37.300 --> 51:42.740
In my opinion, the only good watch is one that also makes phone calls and is an iPhone

51:42.740 --> 51:44.260
because what are you doing?

51:44.260 --> 51:45.140
You know what I did?

51:45.140 --> 51:50.340
I got I need a one when I did all my international traveling, got on Amazon, bought a ten dollar

51:51.060 --> 51:54.180
goddamn ten dollar watch from Casio.

51:54.900 --> 51:55.620
And it's little.

51:55.620 --> 51:56.260
It's black.

51:56.260 --> 51:57.060
It's discreet.

51:57.060 --> 51:59.300
And it tells you what the time is with twelve numbers.

52:00.260 --> 52:04.100
This is this is where I get a little bit mad at fashion.

52:05.220 --> 52:07.620
OK, it is this idea of like the funk.

52:07.620 --> 52:11.940
The watch is a functional thing like you buy it so you know what time it is.

52:11.940 --> 52:17.940
Whether you buy a ten dollar Casio watch or like a four thousand dollar watch, it does

52:17.940 --> 52:19.620
the exact same.

52:19.620 --> 52:24.340
OK, but this is a crazy thing, Travis, because that's that's all of fashion.

52:24.340 --> 52:28.500
We wear shirts so that bees don't sting us in the chest when we go outside.

52:29.620 --> 52:32.500
And then the shirts get a potato sack would accomplish that.

52:32.500 --> 52:32.900
Right.

52:32.900 --> 52:34.980
Shirts get then shirts got crazy.

52:36.100 --> 52:37.780
Shirts got crazy after we wore them.

52:37.780 --> 52:40.500
I know this is what I'm saying is my problem with fashion.

52:40.500 --> 52:46.340
And now dragons and fake tattoos $300 for a shirt that looks like a shirt you buy at

52:46.340 --> 52:51.460
Goodwill, except you get to say you spent $300 on it and you bought it at such and such.

52:51.460 --> 52:52.420
Yeah, dog.

52:52.420 --> 52:53.540
That's fashion.

52:53.540 --> 52:58.340
But Griffin, why are you screaming at me like I'm not agreeing with you?

52:58.340 --> 53:00.980
Because it's like you're surprised by this.

53:00.980 --> 53:04.820
Like we wear shoes so that when we go outside, dogs don't bite us on the feet and give us

53:04.820 --> 53:05.460
diseases.

53:05.460 --> 53:09.700
This is a problem, Travis, that I would like to file under.

53:09.700 --> 53:16.660
I think my theory on these problems are if an entire generation of people have lived

53:16.660 --> 53:21.620
before you and been unable to solve this issue, it's not worth thinking about.

53:21.620 --> 53:24.500
I know that what I'm saying is not incredibly revolutionary.

53:24.500 --> 53:29.460
That was the best that was the most uplifting thing I've ever that was if you could wrap

53:29.460 --> 53:34.020
up the entirety of our generation's political views into one sentence, it would be that

53:34.020 --> 53:38.100
sentence, it would be that thing, or if presented even shorter, ah, fuck it.

53:39.940 --> 53:40.420
Fuck it.

53:40.420 --> 53:41.300
What's on the internet?

53:43.140 --> 53:46.180
Back to the question I asked you, here's what I think your friends were reacting to

53:46.180 --> 53:46.820
on this watch.

53:47.620 --> 53:54.020
I get the impression that you bought this watch, that what drew you to it as a fashion

53:54.020 --> 53:57.300
statement is how incomprehensible it is.

53:58.420 --> 53:58.980
Yes.

53:58.980 --> 54:02.580
And I think your friends were looking at it going, that doesn't make any sense.

54:02.580 --> 54:03.940
I don't know what I'm looking at.

54:06.260 --> 54:09.780
And so, I mean, if that's what you were going for, you nailed it.

54:10.340 --> 54:10.900
Slam dunk.

54:12.740 --> 54:20.180
Well, the other thing is, like, you probably, if three people have commented on your watch,

54:20.740 --> 54:23.700
then you probably said, hey, look at my new watch.

54:23.700 --> 54:25.860
Or like, what do you think of this new watch?

54:25.860 --> 54:27.700
It's like, don't do that.

54:27.700 --> 54:28.420
Just wear it.

54:28.420 --> 54:29.620
If you like it, wear it.

54:29.620 --> 54:33.140
But don't ask people for feedback, because they're just jealous of you.

54:33.140 --> 54:35.380
They're jealous of you and your incomprehensible watch.

54:36.820 --> 54:40.820
If your watch has letters on it, you know what I mean.

54:40.820 --> 54:44.180
The watch, okay, for those of you at home, the watch face has three words on it.

54:44.180 --> 54:45.300
Try to describe it.

54:45.300 --> 54:48.340
Okay, it's got three words on it.

54:48.340 --> 54:53.300
To the left is past, to the right is future, and in the middle is present, with a line

54:53.300 --> 54:58.100
pointing up to what looks like two dials that show the hour and minute, I guess.

54:58.100 --> 55:07.780
I don't think it's, I think the watch face spins behind this facade, and so the actual

55:07.780 --> 55:14.340
numbers line up with the present line instead of having lines, I'm so angry right now.

55:15.380 --> 55:19.220
And it also looks like, because, I don't understand.

55:20.820 --> 55:23.460
Your watch confuses and scares me, sir.

55:23.460 --> 55:30.340
I think, I think it's not too late to return it, and maybe get this watch I got, it's on

55:30.340 --> 55:34.500
Amazon, it's $10, it's a little black dress of wristwatches.

55:34.500 --> 55:36.980
That was the Amazon review, and that's why I bought it.

55:37.780 --> 55:38.980
You know what I mean?

55:38.980 --> 55:43.780
I feel bad for, I feel bad for, I don't want to salt this guy's fashion game, but I just

55:43.780 --> 55:45.620
want you to have nice things.

55:45.620 --> 55:49.700
And I don't, here's, oh, okay, so here's what I'll say about this fashion watch, sir.

55:49.700 --> 55:56.260
If you're wearing this out to like some incredibly fancy awesome event, I could justify it.

55:56.260 --> 56:00.340
Like a special occasion, like the cufflinks of watches, I could justify it.

56:01.220 --> 56:02.100
What are you saying?

56:02.100 --> 56:07.060
I'm saying that like if he was going to some, you know, fancy event, and this was his special

56:07.060 --> 56:11.540
occasion watch, but to wear this every day when you like go to work at Jimmy John's or

56:11.540 --> 56:12.500
whatever, don't fucking wear this watch.

56:12.500 --> 56:19.060
You're saying that this crazy watch is a cool thing to wear to parties, and then you can

56:19.060 --> 56:23.060
be like, hey, Mr. President, did you see my novelty watch?

56:23.940 --> 56:27.460
No, I'm saying that if it's a fashion statement, and this is what you're doing, and that's

56:27.460 --> 56:30.980
what you're going for, this isn't something you whip out your wrist and say, check out

56:30.980 --> 56:31.460
this watch.

56:31.460 --> 56:33.140
You just wear it, and you be cool, and you do whatever.

56:33.140 --> 56:37.460
I guess it is functional, because it hides all the times that you don't give a fuck about.

56:37.460 --> 56:38.100
You know what I mean?

56:38.660 --> 56:41.780
Nobody's ever like, hey, what time was it an hour and a half ago?

56:41.780 --> 56:43.940
And you look down at your watch, like, I can't help you, buddy.

56:43.940 --> 56:45.060
I only know about the present.

56:46.180 --> 56:48.340
I'm thinking about looking towards the future.

56:48.340 --> 56:49.300
You know what I want?

56:49.300 --> 56:54.020
I want a watch like this, but it only tells me what's up 20 minutes in the future.

56:54.020 --> 56:54.980
And they say, what time is it?

56:54.980 --> 56:57.940
You say, I don't know, but in 20 minutes, it's 1145.

56:58.740 --> 57:00.740
And then I got to go watch early edition.

57:00.740 --> 57:01.060
Later.

57:01.060 --> 57:02.900
That's what Looper is about.

57:02.900 --> 57:04.020
Man, have you guys seen Looper?

57:04.020 --> 57:05.940
I haven't seen Looper.

57:05.940 --> 57:06.660
Good, man.

57:06.660 --> 57:09.700
Joseph Gordon Levitt is a rising action star.

57:10.980 --> 57:13.300
I am the president of a student organization at my college.

57:13.300 --> 57:17.220
We recently got a new batch of members, mostly girls, and some of them are cute.

57:17.220 --> 57:18.900
One in particular has caught my attention.

57:18.900 --> 57:23.860
Normally, I just ask her out, but I feel like my position in the org would make it weird.

57:23.860 --> 57:25.380
Is there a conflict of interest here?

57:25.380 --> 57:26.420
Any help will be appreciated.

57:26.420 --> 57:28.660
That's from Stumped in San Marcos.

57:28.660 --> 57:33.140
Before we start, let me go ahead and say that if you ever say we got a big group of girls

57:33.140 --> 57:38.180
and one in particular caught my eye, it also makes you sound like John Wayne Gacy.

57:38.180 --> 57:39.700
There's a lot of things.

57:39.700 --> 57:42.660
There's a lot of things you can say that makes you sound like a serial killer.

57:42.660 --> 57:49.780
I would like to take a vote on the show, but I would like to submit, and I don't know if

57:49.780 --> 57:56.900
I can get a second on this, but I would like to submit that the most important facet of

57:56.900 --> 58:03.620
this has been withheld from us to the extent that we cannot make adequate-

58:03.620 --> 58:05.140
It's what is the organization.

58:05.140 --> 58:06.900
What is the organization?

58:06.900 --> 58:08.740
Is it pizza team?

58:08.740 --> 58:10.420
A team of people who love pizza?

58:10.420 --> 58:11.220
Of course not.

58:11.220 --> 58:12.740
People who love pizza?

58:12.740 --> 58:15.620
You don't want to mess with all the rules and bylaws of pizza team.

58:16.660 --> 58:17.780
Is it pizza club?

58:17.780 --> 58:18.980
No, it's pizza club.

58:18.980 --> 58:19.620
That's different.

58:20.820 --> 58:28.420
I mean, seriously, is it a club that's built around the abolishment of fraternization

58:28.420 --> 58:31.860
between the different sexes of students?

58:31.860 --> 58:32.980
That's a weird club.

58:33.620 --> 58:34.020
That's a weird club.

58:34.020 --> 58:35.540
Hey, you two stop touching.

58:36.260 --> 58:39.700
Dudes and dudes and ladies with ladies.

58:39.700 --> 58:41.220
I thought I told you.

58:43.300 --> 58:44.500
Yeah, you got student council.

58:44.500 --> 58:46.580
There's presidents and vice presidents in college.

58:46.580 --> 58:48.900
Are you the president of the student body?

58:50.020 --> 58:51.060
Because that might be an issue.

58:51.060 --> 58:54.180
Oh, but it's such a great line to be like, I'd love to be the president of your student

58:54.180 --> 58:58.980
body, and then you take off your shirt.

59:00.820 --> 59:02.260
Is it a GLBT group?

59:02.260 --> 59:04.500
Because I don't think things are going to go your way.

59:04.500 --> 59:06.020
I do not think you said those letters right.

59:06.020 --> 59:11.860
I think you said a GBLT, which is-

59:11.860 --> 59:14.340
A McDLT, I'm sorry.

59:15.380 --> 59:17.460
It's a BLT, but with graham crackers on it.

59:18.500 --> 59:20.900
Yeah, it keeps the hot side hot and the cold side cold, which is nice.

59:22.900 --> 59:27.620
I was saying gross about the sandwich, not about the LTGB lifestyle.

59:30.020 --> 59:33.380
I don't know why it has to be about ranking priority.

59:33.380 --> 59:35.780
You know, like as long as you get all the letters in there, people know what you're

59:35.780 --> 59:36.500
talking about.

59:36.500 --> 59:38.020
You could say some of them twice if you wanted to.

59:38.900 --> 59:41.300
It's like, and then it just turns into DNA.

59:42.420 --> 59:44.660
It's a GLBTLGBT.

59:44.660 --> 59:49.060
GLBLTLBTA Gattaca.

59:51.060 --> 59:53.860
It's got to be, I don't know, man.

59:53.860 --> 59:56.100
There's no way that you're not exploiting your power.

59:57.460 --> 59:58.260
What power?

59:58.260 --> 01:00:00.500
Of the fucking presidential power.

01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:07.220
Okay, but like, I'm sorry, you guys, but is there not a point in this where you go,

01:00:07.220 --> 01:00:10.580
hey man, you should just ask the girl out because you're in college and what group you're

01:00:10.580 --> 01:00:11.540
in doesn't really matter?

01:00:11.540 --> 01:00:12.740
No, here's how it's going to play out.

01:00:12.740 --> 01:00:13.540
You ask her out.

01:00:13.540 --> 01:00:15.060
She says yes, obviously.

01:00:15.060 --> 01:00:18.900
You guys hook up, you go on a bunch of dates, you realize you're in love, you buy her a

01:00:18.900 --> 01:00:23.220
ring, you have a long engagement, you get married, you have kids, and then you realize

01:00:23.220 --> 01:00:29.300
45 years in the future that she was only doing it because she was trying to move up the ladder

01:00:29.300 --> 01:00:33.380
of whatever this organization was, and it's going to break your heart, it's going to

01:00:33.380 --> 01:00:37.940
break your kids' hearts, and your grandkids' hearts.

01:00:37.940 --> 01:00:43.060
So wouldn't that be horrifying when you're 67 to realize that it was only because you

01:00:43.060 --> 01:00:44.980
were president of the Young Liberals Club?

01:00:46.420 --> 01:00:46.980
I don't know.

01:00:46.980 --> 01:00:49.380
I think if it's Young Liberals Club, I feel like everybody's fucking anyway.

01:00:50.260 --> 01:00:52.900
Oh yeah, oh yeah.

01:00:52.900 --> 01:00:55.380
I feel like most groups are there in college, I don't even know.

01:00:55.380 --> 01:01:00.900
I feel like most groups are just there to party down on each other, you know what I

01:01:00.900 --> 01:01:01.780
mean?

01:01:01.780 --> 01:01:03.060
I think student government association-

01:01:03.060 --> 01:01:04.180
They are built for fraternization.

01:01:04.180 --> 01:01:07.860
Student government association, when it's like election season, tensions are high, so

01:01:07.860 --> 01:01:08.980
are pheromones.

01:01:10.100 --> 01:01:11.540
A lot of late nights, you know?

01:01:11.540 --> 01:01:18.180
A lot of, you know, sitting around the war table and then just throw all the pieces off

01:01:18.180 --> 01:01:21.140
that war table and then make a fuck pile.

01:01:21.140 --> 01:01:28.500
My favorite scene in 90s documentary The War Room is the scene where George Stephanopoulos

01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:30.820
just buries his cock in James Carver.

01:01:30.820 --> 01:01:31.700
Oh my god.

01:01:31.700 --> 01:01:32.420
Oh no!

01:01:34.180 --> 01:01:34.500
Yeah.

01:01:35.540 --> 01:01:35.860
Yeah.

01:01:36.500 --> 01:01:38.580
I like, me likey.

01:01:38.580 --> 01:01:38.820
I have-

01:01:38.820 --> 01:01:39.700
It's on the Blu-ray.

01:01:39.700 --> 01:01:40.740
Blu-ray deleted scenes.

01:01:40.740 --> 01:01:42.020
I really just got dizzy.

01:01:43.380 --> 01:01:43.860
I got dizzy.

01:01:43.860 --> 01:01:45.460
Because all the blood rushed to your erection?

01:01:45.460 --> 01:01:52.500
Can I say, there was some part of my brain that I thought was dead as I tried to make

01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:58.100
my way through that whole phrase that entire clause was trying to shut me down.

01:01:58.100 --> 01:02:01.380
It was like trying to hold back the tide, though.

01:02:01.380 --> 01:02:04.980
It's like when the bulkheads start to shut down as the ship sinks and it's like, oh,

01:02:04.980 --> 01:02:07.060
we've lost all the guys in engineering.

01:02:07.060 --> 01:02:11.540
You woke up and a part of your brain that made you realize that you were gay but only

01:02:11.540 --> 01:02:16.260
for James Carvel, which is very unfortunate because that dream probably ain't gonna come

01:02:16.260 --> 01:02:16.500
true.

01:02:17.220 --> 01:02:18.580
Yeah, that ship done sailed.

01:02:18.580 --> 01:02:22.100
Hey, listen, thank you so much for listening to our comedy podcast.

01:02:22.100 --> 01:02:23.860
What am I supposed to do with this boner now?

01:02:23.860 --> 01:02:25.940
Because there's nothing I can do with it.

01:02:25.940 --> 01:02:26.500
I have got a rage occasion.

01:02:26.500 --> 01:02:30.740
It's not like there's fucking James Carvel porn on the internet.

01:02:30.740 --> 01:02:33.620
I can't even close my eyes and imagine what that dude looks like naked.

01:02:33.620 --> 01:02:35.460
I just imagine there's baldness everywhere.

01:02:39.060 --> 01:02:40.180
It's just all elbows.

01:02:40.180 --> 01:02:42.660
I just imagine he fucks with Louisiana charms.

01:02:44.660 --> 01:02:47.460
There's just angles everywhere, inexplicably.

01:02:47.460 --> 01:02:49.780
It's like fucking like a Van Gogh painting or something.

01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:54.980
Hey, so anyway, thanks for listening to our show.

01:02:55.940 --> 01:02:57.860
Thank you so much to people tweeting about it.

01:02:57.860 --> 01:03:00.100
They're using the NBNBAM hashtag.

01:03:00.100 --> 01:03:11.140
People like Radioactive Jedi, Bransonatron, Ross Gott, Sir Seahorse, Bedhugs, AstroInnovator,

01:03:11.140 --> 01:03:20.180
Fox and Stars, AngeredFalconMC, Getting, Jessalynzo, HilaryThinks, and so, so much more.

01:03:20.180 --> 01:03:26.980
I would like to just give a shout out to Iggy K, who drank three trash monkeys before moving.

01:03:26.980 --> 01:03:31.700
Not immediately after did he move, but the next morning, which I'm sure it was just awful.

01:03:31.700 --> 01:03:35.140
You're a fool, sir, and you've done it so, so wrong.

01:03:35.940 --> 01:03:38.340
I don't think I've drank three trash monkeys in my life.

01:03:39.540 --> 01:03:42.820
We also have a Facebook group that has thousands of members, and you should join.

01:03:42.820 --> 01:03:43.780
Holy shit, really?

01:03:43.780 --> 01:03:47.540
Yeah, we've got nearly 4,000 members.

01:03:47.540 --> 01:03:50.420
We're basically bigger than Jesus.

01:03:50.420 --> 01:03:51.620
It's basically bigger than Jesus.

01:03:51.620 --> 01:03:55.540
Go to Facebook, search NBNBAM, and you'll find that group.

01:03:55.540 --> 01:04:01.780
You'll see a bunch of people talking about My Brother, My Brother, Me.

01:04:01.780 --> 01:04:06.420
You can also do the same thing on the forums, MaximumFun.org.

01:04:06.420 --> 01:04:10.260
People are discussing the shows and things they like, and it's a great community.

01:04:10.820 --> 01:04:12.420
I just looked up Jesus on Facebook.

01:04:12.420 --> 01:04:14.500
He's got 4.8 million likes.

01:04:14.500 --> 01:04:15.140
We're on the way.

01:04:16.580 --> 01:04:20.020
We're like one-tenth of a percent on the way.

01:04:21.300 --> 01:04:22.660
You gotta start somewhere.

01:04:22.660 --> 01:04:25.300
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters for these for our theme song.

01:04:25.300 --> 01:04:28.500
It's a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

01:04:28.500 --> 01:04:29.460
Thank you, John Roderick.

01:04:29.460 --> 01:04:32.180
He'll be at MaxFunCon East, which I believe is next month.

01:04:33.780 --> 01:04:38.820
I don't know what session he's giving, but maybe artisanal beard growing,

01:04:38.820 --> 01:04:43.300
or how to write the fucking rockin'est songs that there are.

01:04:43.300 --> 01:04:45.380
But make sure you sign up for it if you're going to that.

01:04:45.380 --> 01:04:55.380
We have an exciting promotion coming up, Max Fun Day, October 15th.

01:04:55.380 --> 01:04:56.340
Mark it count.

01:04:56.340 --> 01:04:59.780
Just take off work, because it is a national holiday.

01:04:59.780 --> 01:05:00.740
It's going to get crazy.

01:05:02.020 --> 01:05:03.220
We're going to have some special stuff.

01:05:03.220 --> 01:05:07.940
I think we're going to have a special bonus app for donors, so you can get twice your flow.

01:05:08.660 --> 01:05:14.340
It's going to be huge and fun, and there's going to be giveaways and fun crap, so be there.

01:05:14.340 --> 01:05:17.620
Uh, this final Yahoo answer is sent in by Aurora Case.

01:05:17.620 --> 01:05:18.420
Thank you, Aurora.

01:05:18.420 --> 01:05:21.380
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Mr. Dang, who asks,

01:05:23.140 --> 01:05:26.740
Is it okay for a dang 30-year-old man to watch Goosebumps?

01:05:30.900 --> 01:05:32.020
I'm Justin McElroy.

01:05:32.020 --> 01:05:33.300
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:05:33.300 --> 01:05:34.900
I'm Griffin McElroy.

01:05:34.900 --> 01:05:36.420
This has been my brother, my brother, and me.

01:05:36.420 --> 01:05:37.460
Kiss your dad.

01:05:37.460 --> 01:05:38.580
School wear on the lips.

01:05:38.580 --> 01:05:44.900
Keep your heart, three stacks.

01:05:44.900 --> 01:05:45.940
Keep your heart.

01:05:45.940 --> 01:05:48.100
Hey, keep your heart, three stacks.

01:05:48.100 --> 01:05:49.140
Keep your heart.

01:05:49.140 --> 01:05:51.060
Man, these girls are smart, three stacks.

01:05:51.060 --> 01:05:52.180
These girls are smart.

01:05:52.180 --> 01:06:10.740
Keep your heart, play your part.
