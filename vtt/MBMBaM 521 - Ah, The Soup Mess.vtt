00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.640 --> 00:47.760
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me, an advice show for the

00:47.760 --> 00:53.280
modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. Oh, sorry, Griffin, I need you to,

00:53.280 --> 00:56.400
Griffin, I need you to go first. You should have freaking told me that, man.

00:56.400 --> 00:58.880
I'm telling you now, Griffin. You caught me with my pants down.

00:58.880 --> 01:00.720
Okay, do it. Let me see if I can even remember what to

01:00.720 --> 01:04.640
say because I need you as like the, to be my prompter. Let me see.

01:04.640 --> 01:07.360
Okay, well how about this. I'm your middle-aged brother, Travis McElroy.

01:07.360 --> 01:10.720
And I'm Griffin McElroy, the young, and I'll, I'm do Griffin.

01:10.720 --> 01:14.720
Shit. Oh, I didn't see you come in there. Sweep,

01:14.720 --> 01:20.720
sweep, sweep, sweep. I was just cleaning up after another maximum fun drive. Sweep,

01:20.720 --> 01:28.480
sweep, sweep. Trying to put all of our wonderful characters and costumes and grease paint

01:28.480 --> 01:32.800
back in the trunk for another year. Sweep, sweep, sweep, mop, mop, mop.

01:32.800 --> 01:40.560
Hey, it's old, it's old Bill. And he cleans up after us and when we do the max fun drive and

01:41.920 --> 01:45.040
old Bill, I got to say, we made a huge dirty mess this time, bud.

01:45.600 --> 01:49.440
Yeah, there's a lot of unused dildo jokes around here.

01:51.280 --> 01:56.160
That's my fault. I've been stockpiling them thinking I'd get on a great run

01:56.160 --> 02:02.720
about dildos and it never came. I actually, that is part of my, I bought a bunch of dildo

02:02.720 --> 02:08.960
jokes from extreme restraints.com several years back and I haven't had a chance to burn through

02:08.960 --> 02:13.760
them. Well, don't burn your dildos. That is bad for the environment. See,

02:13.760 --> 02:17.680
that's just one of the jokes you guys could have used this year. You didn't.

02:17.680 --> 02:20.800
You're leaving a lot on the table for this max fun drive.

02:20.800 --> 02:26.400
Uh, it looks like that extreme restraints won't do a refund on these dildo jokes,

02:26.400 --> 02:30.720
but they will do store credit if we did want to do a bunch of lube jokes.

02:32.480 --> 02:34.080
Something to keep in mind. You want to trade them in for lube

02:34.080 --> 02:39.520
jokes? Will they exchange one dildo joke and give us a sample of the lube jokes

02:40.480 --> 02:42.560
so we can get kind of an idea of what we're talking about?

02:43.120 --> 02:50.720
Yeah, it just says, here it comes, careful around this, but careful

02:50.720 --> 02:55.600
around this, but it's slippery when wet. This is just Travis leaning back in.

02:55.600 --> 03:00.480
This one just says lube him. I barely know him. So that's good. That could be cool.

03:01.280 --> 03:10.800
Yeah. I, um, uh, I, I have a huge contraption, uh, with various gears and cranks and turning,

03:11.520 --> 03:17.840
uh, things. It's a very complicated and it's just for slamming my butt. It's called a lube

03:17.840 --> 03:22.000
Goldberg machine. Oh, that's nice. And that's great. Okay. Yeah. There's a,

03:22.000 --> 03:26.160
this deal's going through, baby. Yeah. Hey, uh, just, this is old Bill still.

03:26.160 --> 03:28.240
Old Bill, what are you guys talking about? Do you guys want me to stick around?

03:28.240 --> 03:30.720
Nah, we're doing like a different intro thing now, old Bill.

03:31.360 --> 03:36.080
Cause I was cleaning up after, cause this is the last week of the Maximum Fun Drive. Sweep,

03:36.080 --> 03:42.880
sweep, sweep. And this is people's last chance to become a member here at Maximum Fun HQ. Sweep,

03:42.880 --> 03:48.960
sweep, sweep, but just keep the lights on. Keep old Bill, uh, in, in, you know, I do a lot of

03:48.960 --> 03:54.560
collectibles. I have a lot of porcelain figures that I can't afford without your max fund membership.

03:54.560 --> 04:00.560
Sweep, sweep, sweep, mop, mop, mop. Yeah. And that is Bill Maher, which is weird.

04:00.560 --> 04:05.200
That's so weird. That Bill Maher is the one who cleans up after.

04:05.840 --> 04:09.360
I don't do it for the money. I do it for the love, the love of the cleaning.

04:09.360 --> 04:13.200
Well, you do do it kind of for the money, Bill. Well, for the porcelain figures,

04:13.200 --> 04:16.000
but I don't live off of porcelain figures. I mean.

04:17.040 --> 04:19.920
Um, who would have been funnier there? If I'd said Bill de Blasio.

04:20.720 --> 04:23.360
Bill de Blasio? Billingfall.

04:23.360 --> 04:26.880
Should I give him like the- Bill Nye? But that wouldn't explain the-

04:26.880 --> 04:29.360
That wouldn't explain the accent. No, I'm Bill Nye.

04:30.640 --> 04:33.280
Oh. Bill Nye the cleaning guy.

04:33.280 --> 04:38.160
Do you think Bill Nye, people get him confused for Bill Nye saying his name in a cool way? Like

04:38.160 --> 04:44.800
here comes Bill Nye? So did you guys want me to stick around and-

04:44.800 --> 04:48.880
No, I don't want you to have been here in the first place, Bill Maher. I think your

04:48.880 --> 04:52.080
shit's reprehensible. I'm a different Bill Maher.

04:53.200 --> 04:56.560
Okay. I'm the one who loves cleaning.

04:57.280 --> 05:01.680
So this is the final episode of the Max Fun Drive. Fortunately, we've probably gotten all

05:01.680 --> 05:04.640
the money from you that we're going to get because you're certainly not going to reward

05:04.640 --> 05:11.440
us after this. I would say bad introduction. I should also tell you, this is my two weeks

05:11.440 --> 05:16.800
notice. So this is old Bill's final episode too. You guys will have to clean up your own

05:16.800 --> 05:21.440
dildo jokes after this. You won't have old Bill to push around anymore. Sweep, sweep,

05:21.440 --> 05:24.400
sweep. I have a brief story to tell you.

05:24.400 --> 05:25.280
Okay. Is it about me?

05:26.000 --> 05:32.640
Bill Nye was a regular in a restaurant called Fiorello's on the Upper West Side back in 2015.

05:32.640 --> 05:37.920
Well, he was performing Skylight on Broadway. He went in one night and the staff said,

05:37.920 --> 05:43.520
Hey, Mr. Nye, the other Bill Nye is in the back of the restaurant. I said, Oh my God,

05:43.520 --> 05:48.880
the pair met and had pictures taken. So were they friends or foes? There was no conflict.

05:49.360 --> 05:51.200
We were respectful of one another.

05:51.200 --> 05:59.520
I was slightly sniffy because my name is rarer, but he doesn't know that. He was very gracious

05:59.520 --> 06:05.040
and we had a laugh and he'd had this conversation with people same as I had. So it was quite

06:05.040 --> 06:11.040
funny to finally be united. Okay. This story is great, but the person I want to celebrate

06:11.040 --> 06:19.600
is the person who worked the restaurant is like, Oh my fuck. Oh my God, it's happening

06:19.600 --> 06:25.600
and I'm going to fucking do it. That's the weird thing is like, I'm going to go to Bill

06:25.600 --> 06:30.800
Nye. I'm going to go to fucking, uh, uh, uh, what's his pirate? Davy Jones. Davy Jones.

06:30.800 --> 06:35.360
I'm going to go right up to Davy Jones and tell him that beloved site is Bill Nye is

06:35.360 --> 06:38.720
in this restaurant too. He's going to love this shit.

06:38.720 --> 06:44.720
The moment I would love to be in the brain of that employee for is when Bill Nye walked

06:44.720 --> 06:51.440
in and knowing Bill Nye, he was a regular that like the, the air of possibility. It

06:51.440 --> 06:57.760
wasn't just crackled. Yes. I'm just like, it's happening. It's all just like the fortune

06:57.760 --> 07:02.240
teller said. Anyway, this is the final episode of the max fun drive. Please, if you have

07:02.240 --> 07:07.120
not, uh, joined the network, if you do enjoy our show and the other stuff that we make

07:07.120 --> 07:11.680
and you want to support us in a very, very direct and meaningful way, uh, you can go

07:11.680 --> 07:16.880
to maximumfund.org slash join and, uh, sign up to become a member, find the monthly membership

07:16.880 --> 07:23.360
level that, uh, works for you. We know it is a strange time, uh, and, uh, an extremely

07:23.360 --> 07:29.440
bad time. Um, but we, uh, strange almost didn't seem to cover it. Strange doesn't cover it

07:29.440 --> 07:33.920
at all, but we, we do need your, uh, support and your support has allowed us to grow over

07:33.920 --> 07:38.960
the last 10 years and turn this into our jobs and allow us to do all kinds of really fantastic

07:38.960 --> 07:43.280
stuff. Uh, and so, uh, yeah, go, go check out the different levels. We will talk about

07:43.280 --> 07:47.760
them later on in the show, but once again, it's maximumfund.org slash join, and this

07:47.760 --> 07:51.920
is the last week of the drive. So, uh, if you, if you have been thinking about doing

07:51.920 --> 07:57.600
it, don't wait, let's get into questions. Let's like help for a change. Finally. Sure.

07:58.400 --> 08:04.560
Finally, let's help someone. Let me just open the question. Yeah. Somebody try, I don't

08:04.560 --> 08:10.320
know if you sent them. I might not have. Okay. I mean, I'm looking at them. The wheels have

08:10.320 --> 08:17.280
fallen off here. Let's go ahead and get those over on my desk. Pronto. I mean, I'm, I've

08:17.280 --> 08:22.560
got them. Yeah, you've got them, but does that help me? Oh, you know, I guess I never

08:22.560 --> 08:27.920
really thought about it like that, Jamien. Let's have it, bud. Come on. I just sent it.

08:27.920 --> 08:33.040
You couldn't even put a subject in. Wow. No, I was rushing. You said top speed. You can't

08:33.040 --> 08:37.600
see top speed and then get mad at me for not putting this. Dear Justin, these are the questions.

08:37.600 --> 08:44.960
Love Travis. What if I need to find the right archives later? I come to you today and need

08:44.960 --> 08:52.720
a bit of advice. That was unnecessary. I sent applications to many a college. Many have

08:52.720 --> 08:57.360
sent back swag as stuff they like to call it. Travis, do you know what swag stands for?

08:57.360 --> 09:08.880
Uh, sweet. Willy. Agreed. Stuff we all get. Oh. Yeah. As they like to call it. Most of

09:08.880 --> 09:13.200
it is garbage, but one college sent me the most exquisite shirt. It proudly proclaims

09:13.200 --> 09:17.760
I'm a member of their class of 2024, which I am not. I've worn this shirt many a time

09:17.760 --> 09:21.600
at home as it is extremely comfortable. I wore it in public once where someone yelled

09:21.600 --> 09:28.640
from a six feet distance. Yo, mascot represent. They didn't say mascot obviously. I had to

09:28.640 --> 09:32.800
pretend I didn't hear him. What do I do if this happens again? That's for misrepresented

09:32.800 --> 09:39.840
alma mater in Maine. I, uh, I had a shirt from Shepherd University, which I did a tour of,

09:39.840 --> 09:45.600
uh, when I was weighing my options that, uh, I only recently got rid of and I did wear

09:45.600 --> 09:48.880
a lot and did have a couple of times where people was like, oh, fuck yeah. Shepherd.

09:48.880 --> 09:54.320
I went there. What, what, what was your major? I'd be like, my major was going to Marshall

09:54.320 --> 09:59.440
University. A fine, a very fine institution. And I'm sorry that I wore that shirt, but,

09:59.440 --> 10:05.440
uh, it, it makes my, it makes my eyes pop. You know, but there's another for, I got a

10:05.440 --> 10:11.360
version of this where I did go to the University of Oklahoma and I would wear an OU sweatshirt

10:11.360 --> 10:16.480
and someone would say boomer sooner and then attempt to ask me about what I thought of

10:16.480 --> 10:22.000
current football team. That's tough. That's tough. That's when you play the part of,

10:22.000 --> 10:27.680
I didn't go to OU. I just liked this shirt. But I did. My thing is having people yell

10:27.680 --> 10:31.840
boomer sooner at me. Yeah. Just like that. That's the only way I could feel alive.

10:33.520 --> 10:37.920
Um, I mean, you gotta know that this is a risk when you wear a free shirt. Like there's

10:37.920 --> 10:43.200
no such thing as a free shirt. I forget who said that. Um, it was Abraham Lincoln. It was

10:43.200 --> 10:50.880
Abe Lincoln. Uh, and that's why he was the, what we call the topless president. Um, always had

10:50.880 --> 10:54.960
even when someone tried to buy him a shirt or tried to sell him a shirt. He said nice. He said

10:54.960 --> 10:58.640
nice fucking try. He said, you gotta wake up a little bit earlier than that to get old Abe

10:58.640 --> 11:06.640
Lincoln. And, and then unfortunately, um, someone did wake up quite early. Um, I don't think you

11:06.640 --> 11:11.760
should wear the shirt anymore if you're not ready to, if you don't have like an arrow in this quiver,

11:11.760 --> 11:18.400
you know what I mean? Especially since it says class of 2024. So it is not just like,

11:18.400 --> 11:22.320
it doesn't just say like Marshall University. It says Marshall University,

11:22.320 --> 11:29.600
class of 2024. Your shirt is a lie. It's a lie. It is weird though. It's a weird called shot for

11:29.600 --> 11:34.720
this school, right? Like, well, I'm not going to come there. Well, but we gave you the shirt.

11:34.720 --> 11:39.520
Maybe. The shirt said you did come here. Your shirt said you're coming. I mean, listen,

11:39.520 --> 11:44.240
it says right here, it's an exquisite shirt. Seems like this college is so confident in this shirt

11:44.240 --> 11:48.400
that they're like, once we send them the shirt, we got them. This is like when McDonald's sent

11:48.400 --> 11:53.920
me a shirt that said I ate 100 Big Macs today. And then I was like, oh geez. I mean, I do want

11:53.920 --> 12:00.640
to wear the shirt, but oh shit. Now it's like a prophecy. Now it's now we're, we're as final

12:00.640 --> 12:05.040
destination. There's no escaping this. I'm going to eat a hundred big, big, big, big Macs today.

12:05.040 --> 12:07.760
Yeah. Maybe you should just go to the college. Do you think about that?

12:07.760 --> 12:13.840
Just freaking go and expand your horizons. Take some classes, learn a new language.

12:14.400 --> 12:19.280
They probably have other cool shirts. Oh yeah. Experiment with yourself, with your body.

12:19.280 --> 12:20.400
With your body.

12:20.400 --> 12:21.600
With other people's bodies?

12:23.040 --> 12:23.920
With consent.

12:23.920 --> 12:24.320
With consent.

12:24.320 --> 12:26.400
Do not experiment on people without consent.

12:26.400 --> 12:28.800
But biohack your body. Give yourself like a-

12:28.800 --> 12:30.880
Yeah, biohack your body. See if you can make your butt glow like a firefly.

12:30.880 --> 12:35.840
Put a fucking flash drive somewhere in there. Give yourself like a, an antenna.

12:35.840 --> 12:37.840
Oh yeah.

12:37.840 --> 12:41.280
That's what college is for, is to put in antennas.

12:41.280 --> 12:47.040
And what I hate about this, this show is I can't even zone out for 30 seconds and then snap back

12:47.040 --> 12:51.200
in and have any idea what the fuck you guys are talking about. You know what I mean? I feel like

12:51.200 --> 12:55.600
I should be able to check out every once in a while and check back in and be like, oh, I get

12:55.600 --> 12:59.600
the bit. I know what we're doing here, but like antennas and stuff. What are you talking about?

12:59.600 --> 13:05.120
You see, one time my friend Bob told me that people were inventing this biohacking thing

13:05.120 --> 13:09.920
where I could inject myself with some sort of genome that made it so my muscles were engaged

13:09.920 --> 13:14.400
all the time and would give me super strength. Now, to Bob's credit, I don't know how much of

13:14.400 --> 13:18.400
that is what he actually said, or how much of that is what I just heard.

13:18.400 --> 13:18.800
Hold on.

13:18.800 --> 13:19.440
But ever since-

13:19.440 --> 13:21.120
Very difficult thing, isn't it? Memory.

13:21.120 --> 13:23.920
Yes. So ever since I heard that, I've just thought about like, hey,

13:23.920 --> 13:27.600
can we hurry up and perfect that? Because that sounds really cool.

13:27.600 --> 13:30.240
So you're telling me like you go to the optometrist and they're like, oh yeah,

13:30.240 --> 13:36.160
Travis, it looks like your eyes, they do need a slightly stronger prescription. It looks like

13:36.160 --> 13:40.720
your cones have deteriorated. But what you're hearing is like, yeah, we're going to give you

13:40.720 --> 13:46.960
super cool laser glasses that are going to turn your eyes into x-ray eyes, and you're going to

13:46.960 --> 13:47.760
love it.

13:47.760 --> 13:51.280
I am always disappointed when I get the eye tests and they do the lens things and they're like,

13:51.280 --> 13:56.160
better like this or better like that. And I want it to just keep getting better. Like where's that

13:56.160 --> 14:03.280
glasses technology, right? Like if you know how to fix my eyes to normal, just keep going.

14:03.280 --> 14:07.920
That's good. That's good. That's that Seinfeld shit. Here's a Yahoo that was-

14:07.920 --> 14:10.480
That's not a joke. I'm angry about this.

14:10.480 --> 14:14.080
I know, I know. Graham Roboc sent this one in. Thanks, Graham. It's from an anonymous Yahoo

14:14.080 --> 14:19.600
answers user who I'm going to call Lucius asks, I dropped my library book in the toilet and I need

14:19.600 --> 14:20.880
to return it by tomorrow.

14:20.880 --> 14:26.800
So after pulling it out of the toilet, most of the pages were wet. Can I still take the book back?

14:26.800 --> 14:34.720
If not, how can I dry it without damaging it even more? I don't know that there is a level of dryness

14:35.680 --> 14:41.040
that is ever going to make it not a toilet book. Like you can remove, you can remove,

14:41.040 --> 14:47.040
you can desaturate the book, but you cannot de-toilet-ate the book. It will always be a

14:47.040 --> 14:55.120
toilet book forever now. And here's the thing, folks. Before you all jump to email us, dear

14:55.120 --> 15:03.040
Justin, Travis, and Griffin, maybe it was a clean toilet. One, no such thing. Two, are you saying

15:03.040 --> 15:08.240
that this question asker was just standing over the toilet, not using it, just like that's where

15:08.240 --> 15:13.600
they had stopped randomly to read their book over an open toilet? I'm so glad Travis finally brought

15:13.600 --> 15:19.680
this up because every episode we get these clean toilet people coming after us because we talk

15:19.680 --> 15:25.600
about like, oh no, you dropped your phone in the toilet, it's done. Every fucking episode we get 50

15:25.600 --> 15:32.160
emails like, oh, toilets can be clean if you clean them. People listen. At the toilet factory where

15:32.160 --> 15:38.640
they make the toilets, somebody finishes screwing on the toilet seat and gives it one final spit

15:38.640 --> 15:45.840
shine and then they look at it and they go, ugh, gross. It's a toilet where people do the worst

15:45.840 --> 15:51.600
stuff we can do with our bodies, we do to these chairs. There is no cleaning them.

15:51.600 --> 15:57.440
When they raise the toilets in captivity, the elders tell them there is no better life for you,

15:57.440 --> 16:04.320
child. You must accept now you are a dookie machine. They don't aspire to anything better

16:04.320 --> 16:11.840
than that. This is what they assume they're made for and that is unshakable. If you drop a book

16:13.040 --> 16:21.120
in a toilet that's just come out of the store, it still has been raised to know that it accepts

16:21.120 --> 16:26.720
only excrement and pee pee. There should be a fancy word for pee pee. I know, right?

16:26.720 --> 16:34.640
Yeah. The good news is this, that a book was already written that lets you know at what

16:34.640 --> 16:42.640
temperature books burn. So if you pop that book in the oven at 450, that's going to dry that out.

16:44.640 --> 16:47.200
450 is going to get it done fast.

16:47.200 --> 16:53.920
You may even want to, I don't know how precise your oven is. Calibration is important, but

16:53.920 --> 16:56.960
you may even want to bump that down a few degrees.

16:56.960 --> 17:01.280
No, no, no. If you're talking about how fast you can do it, 450, but Justin is right. You

17:01.280 --> 17:03.920
are going to want an accurate temperature in there because sometimes it could be plus or

17:03.920 --> 17:04.800
minus five degrees.

17:04.800 --> 17:07.920
Yeah. And then you're going to fucking call Ray Bradbury and be like,

17:07.920 --> 17:11.040
I have a complaint to regist- Oh, he's not. He's pat- Oh.

17:12.000 --> 17:17.840
Do you think old Ray Bradbury was doing some really in-depth testing with that where he's like,

17:17.840 --> 17:24.240
okay, 450, no, 452, definitely. Let me see. There's gotta be.

17:26.480 --> 17:32.160
Yeah. So here's the good news. You can look inside of the library book for that little

17:32.160 --> 17:36.560
card that I'm guessing is still in there that shows you how many times it's been checked out.

17:37.120 --> 17:37.680
Yeah.

17:37.680 --> 17:45.840
Let's say if your name is the third one on there, if you are at least the third person to have

17:45.840 --> 17:50.400
been loaned this book, it's been in a toilet at some point. At some point-

17:50.400 --> 17:52.160
In the toilet or around the toilet?

17:53.520 --> 17:58.240
I mean, I'm not so much of a proof that I think if it's in a bathroom somewhere, that it has been

17:58.240 --> 18:04.560
permanently befouled as it would if it had actually entered the commode perimeter. But if you're the

18:04.560 --> 18:11.360
third person to get this book, odds are one of the first two people did drop it in the loo.

18:11.360 --> 18:19.680
Now, one time I did leave a paperback copy of 1984 in the rain, and it did dry. But when it dried,

18:19.680 --> 18:25.440
it was all wrinkly and crinkly, which I don't understand the chemical reaction that happened

18:25.440 --> 18:32.480
there. But it was pretty obvious that something dynamic had happened to this tome. So I don't know

18:32.480 --> 18:36.960
that you could, even if you dried it thoroughly, roll back up and be like, yeah, I finished it.

18:36.960 --> 18:39.920
It was a real page-turner. Here you go.

18:39.920 --> 18:47.680
Yeah, that's a good point. There is no, sorry. I don't know what kind of book conditioner you

18:47.680 --> 18:50.800
need to rub all over these pages in order to get back there.

18:50.800 --> 18:54.240
I would like you to trust me with another book now, please.

18:58.640 --> 19:03.520
It's weird how even if a book dries out after you get it wet, it still looks wild.

19:03.520 --> 19:04.000
Yeah.

19:04.000 --> 19:08.240
Isn't that weird? The book's like, oh, finally, I can kind of stretch out a little bit.

19:08.240 --> 19:12.240
Oh, thank you so much. This is the real me.

19:14.400 --> 19:15.760
How about another question?

19:15.760 --> 19:20.960
Oh, Griff, I'd love that, bud. What I'd love even more is if it had just happened organically,

19:20.960 --> 19:24.320
because I think we all felt the moment, and I was about to just launch into it.

19:24.320 --> 19:24.720
Okay.

19:24.720 --> 19:27.680
So just kind of, okay, just a note.

19:27.680 --> 19:28.880
How about another question?

19:28.880 --> 19:33.120
I recently got a new water bottle that's big enough to hold the recommended daily intake.

19:33.120 --> 19:39.520
That's not possible. You don't think you're going to have a 64-ounce water bottle?

19:39.520 --> 19:45.360
Nobody should be drinking 60. I scoff at 64-ounce. I have 64 ounces before breakfast.

19:45.360 --> 19:46.160
Wait, do you-

19:46.160 --> 19:46.960
I'm putting away-

19:46.960 --> 19:47.760
I'm confused.

19:48.320 --> 19:50.800
I'm putting away 120 on the daily.

19:50.800 --> 19:51.920
Are you okay?

19:51.920 --> 19:53.120
That's a lot, bud.

19:53.120 --> 19:57.120
You know what? If you look at that 64-ounce's recommendation, that doesn't take into account

19:57.120 --> 20:01.840
height, weight, activity, none of that stuff. And it's also antiquated.

20:01.840 --> 20:05.600
We need to be pounding water 24 hours a day.

20:06.800 --> 20:08.880
Not so much that you die, lawyers.

20:09.600 --> 20:10.080
Sorry.

20:10.080 --> 20:11.200
But what about when I'm asleep?

20:11.920 --> 20:13.600
Sorry, lawyers.

20:13.600 --> 20:15.440
Not so much that you die, asterisk.

20:15.440 --> 20:21.120
And Justin's not going to say don't pee so you keep all that good water inside your body

20:21.120 --> 20:26.560
anymore, because he used to say stuff like that, and we did get in a little spot of legal trouble.

20:26.560 --> 20:34.560
Yeah, you just- Anyway, it's not possible. I have a 20-ounce water bottle that I drink

20:35.280 --> 20:39.040
six to eight times every day. You need more water.

20:39.040 --> 20:40.880
And you're a big strong boy.

20:40.880 --> 20:42.320
I'm a huge man.

20:42.320 --> 20:42.880
That's not what I said.

20:42.880 --> 20:47.360
I recently got a new water bottle. It's big enough to hold the recommended daily intake,

20:47.360 --> 20:51.600
which we've established as a fabrication. But moving on. I've been filling it up in my

20:51.600 --> 20:56.800
work's water cooler with no issue. But as I was filling it up today, two people got in line behind

20:56.800 --> 21:01.360
me. One of my co-workers started talking about how we only have a limited number of water jugs

21:01.360 --> 21:06.560
for everyone to use. How should I just take one of the huge gallons back to my desk and joked if I

21:06.560 --> 21:11.280
was going to replace the bottle when I was done? What's the etiquette here? Should I fill my bottle

21:11.280 --> 21:15.840
up at home instead? Should I step out of line if other people are behind me? I just want to stay

21:15.840 --> 21:18.160
hydrated. That's from professionally parched.

21:18.160 --> 21:20.560
Your co-worker is a fucking asshole.

21:20.560 --> 21:26.000
Yeah, I think a good tactic here is to sort of hoist up your leg and lift open the bottom of

21:26.000 --> 21:30.880
one of the pant legs and tell them to huff the farts right out of there. If that's the fucking

21:30.880 --> 21:33.200
energy and attitude they're going to bring to your doorstep.

21:33.760 --> 21:40.480
Your job has so few bennies, right? Like you get, what, maybe if you're lucky, insurance.

21:41.040 --> 21:50.080
Maybe like a parking space, right? Maybe even a company car. But water is a basic human building

21:50.080 --> 21:50.640
block.

21:50.640 --> 21:54.240
Shitty! These co-workers who are complaining are like,

21:54.240 --> 21:58.640
yeah, I mean, we've all signed on to work until our bodies die and we'll be kept at

21:58.640 --> 22:04.320
sort of the poverty line the whole time, but too much free wawa over there, don't you think, Jeffy?

22:04.320 --> 22:11.600
No, okay. I want to leap to the co-worker's defense, which they don't list in our podcast,

22:11.600 --> 22:17.280
so I don't know why I'm doing this. But if this person does have, and we have to assume a 64 ounce

22:17.280 --> 22:22.160
bottle of water, because I feel like anything larger than that would be wild. I mean, I've

22:22.160 --> 22:31.360
maybe seen big gulps that are bigger, but very rare. This is a lot. I mean, this is a tankard,

22:31.360 --> 22:39.360
okay? This is a big, big old, big old jug. If you just want to get up and enjoy a cup of water

22:40.160 --> 22:46.400
and someone is like taking five minutes to fill their tankard, I think that you're into like

22:46.400 --> 22:53.840
grocery rules, right? I have one thing, you have 50 things, I'll go ahead. Oh, you only have one

22:53.840 --> 22:58.480
thing, you go right ahead because I don't want to hold you up with my 100 things that I'm buying.

22:58.480 --> 23:02.480
I feel like if you're going to fill up a huge jug of water and there's somebody behind you that

23:02.480 --> 23:07.280
just has one of those delicate little cones for no one, then you should let them have their delicate

23:07.280 --> 23:12.720
cone of water like they're a fucking hummingbird that knows shit about hydration.

23:12.720 --> 23:18.480
What I like to call the memory of a drink. Imagine if one of those paper cones probably

23:18.480 --> 23:24.800
holds six ounces of water, right? If that. If that, right? So your daily amount of hydration

23:25.440 --> 23:32.400
is 10 times, oh sorry, I'm reading now four ounces, okay? So that's basically not applicable.

23:32.400 --> 23:37.840
I have to get a calculator out now to figure out. 16. Let's say we're working off 64, it's four

23:37.840 --> 23:45.840
ounces. That's 16 cups of water. Imagine if you were standing behind someone and they filled that

23:45.840 --> 23:51.120
cup up and pounded it 16 times right in front of you. Now that'd be amazing. It'd be amazing.

23:52.000 --> 23:55.920
How about this? The next time that asshole coworker is out there, because here's the thing,

23:55.920 --> 24:00.880
Justin, you're not wrong about the grocery rules. I do agree with you on that. If they had said,

24:00.880 --> 24:05.360
may I fill my cup real quick? That's not what I said though, is it? No. So here's what you do.

24:05.360 --> 24:09.360
Next time you see them getting up, you beeline over there and get in front of them, and you have

24:09.360 --> 24:16.560
taken an empty water jug jug, and you're just going to transfer all the water left in the jug

24:16.560 --> 24:22.240
into your giant jug, and then take your empty water jug back to your desk, leaving an empty

24:22.240 --> 24:30.240
water jug on the top. And then the juice is running. And then it's going to come at a premium.

24:30.240 --> 24:36.480
You've moved all the full jugs to your desk where you sit atop them in an H.T.O.O. throne.

24:37.120 --> 24:39.440
And what will you do after you're fired that day?

24:42.080 --> 24:45.440
I mean, they can't fire you at that point. You're fucking a Morton Joe.

24:46.080 --> 24:49.840
You are the keeper of the water. The water flows when you say it does.

24:49.840 --> 24:51.920
I drink your bottled water.

24:51.920 --> 25:00.640
I've abandoned my job. You don't have time to work. You're hoarding water.

25:02.240 --> 25:08.080
It's the fucking gall. Are you going to replace that? The fucking gall of it.

25:08.960 --> 25:17.120
No one wants to be here. It's water. Can you not just fucking chill? Go to the sink. The sink

25:17.120 --> 25:23.760
water is fucking fine. I'm giving you a 10 minute excuse not to work. You're welcome.

25:24.400 --> 25:31.360
We should be in the boss's office fucking tearing them limb from a limb for what they're doing for

25:31.360 --> 25:37.680
us. And then we are going to take this building hostage and dismantle the entire fucking economy

25:38.240 --> 25:44.720
brick by brick and nail by nail. But you're in here like too much water, Dougie. Are you fucking

25:44.720 --> 25:53.360
kidding me? Yeah, this is something that the ruling class has invented to keep the peasants

25:53.360 --> 25:57.840
occupied. It's not even counting deck chairs on the Titanic. It's like someone coughed in

25:57.840 --> 26:02.240
the Titanic while it was sinking. And another person was like, can you cover your mouth?

26:07.680 --> 26:14.320
How rude. It's like somebody fucking drop kicks you off of a lifeboat on the Titanic. So all

26:14.320 --> 26:19.760
the riches can get on it. And you accidentally bump into another poor on the way. And they're

26:19.760 --> 26:28.000
like, what's your fucking problem, man? You think there had to be, I bet what you're describing with

26:28.000 --> 26:32.720
the coughing did happen at least one time on the Titanic. Oh yeah. That would be so choice.

26:33.360 --> 26:37.120
Could you tell me a little bit about Max Fun Drive? All right. Let's say that I love supporting

26:37.120 --> 26:41.120
the things that I love. And I'm already at Maximumfun.org forward slash join. I'm ready

26:41.120 --> 26:47.920
to pledge some money to help keep these wonderful shows going, but I'm doing it out of the goodness

26:47.920 --> 26:52.800
of my heart. But guess what? I'm going to get some gifts in return. If I pledge $5 a month,

26:52.800 --> 27:02.000
I'm going to get over 200 hours of bonus content. Our amount of stuff there is wild. There's

27:02.720 --> 27:09.200
commentary tracks for our TV show. We've had episodes where our wives do the show

27:09.200 --> 27:16.400
for us out of, which was one of my faves because it didn't require any work. And they're better

27:16.400 --> 27:20.880
at it than we are. And they're much better. Better at it than we are. Their advice is actually like

27:20.880 --> 27:27.840
worth taking, which is a big departure for us. If you can pledge $10, there's many other shows with,

27:27.840 --> 27:35.520
I mean, many dozens of other programs to enjoy. If you can pledge $10 a month, you can get all

27:35.520 --> 27:41.920
the boco, as I hate saying. But you're also going to get one of 40 different enamel pins

27:43.280 --> 27:48.160
from your favorite Max Fun show. There's other gifts. $20 a month, there's a game pack with

27:48.720 --> 27:53.760
Max Fun dice and cards. But really what you're doing is you're pledging money to help keep the

27:53.760 --> 28:00.480
shows you love coming. Out of every pledge, a small portion of it goes to Max Fun. And then

28:00.480 --> 28:04.800
the rest is divided amongst the shows that you say you listen to when you sign up. So it's a way of

28:04.800 --> 28:11.280
directly supporting these shows. That money goes to, well, for starters, it helps us pay our bills

28:11.280 --> 28:17.200
and feed our kids and put clothes on their backs, which is so cool of you. But also buy audio

28:17.200 --> 28:24.880
equipment and hosting and everything else. So we very, very, very much appreciate your support.

28:26.400 --> 28:33.600
Literally, this is not a line. It is the only reason we are able to do what we do,

28:33.600 --> 28:41.200
especially currently with the world as shitty as it is. We can't go tour, do any sort of live stuff

28:41.200 --> 28:47.440
or anything like that. So we really are depending on you. So please, please, please, please, please,

28:47.440 --> 28:53.360
please, please, please, maximumfun.org forward slash join. This is the last time you're going

28:53.360 --> 28:57.840
to hear about it on our show, except for maybe a brief reminder at the end. If you've been waiting

28:57.840 --> 29:04.240
until the last moment, this is practically it. Please, maximumfun.org forward slash join. If

29:04.240 --> 29:10.000
you're already a member, we really appreciate you. You're the best. Thank you so, so, so much.

29:10.880 --> 29:15.360
And please, if you can find it in your heart and you're not already a member, please go ahead and

29:15.360 --> 29:20.560
join us. And we should just say, I mean, we're pitching this, right? This is the max fun time

29:20.560 --> 29:25.840
of year. But if you're not able to, we also understand that. Man, it's uncertain out there.

29:25.840 --> 29:28.640
We were just talking about like, we haven't been able to tour. We haven't been able to do stuff.

29:28.640 --> 29:33.280
We get it. It's tough out there for everybody. And if you're not able to, you can do things like

29:33.280 --> 29:39.600
share that maximumfun.org slash join link. You can use the hashtag max fun drive. You can share

29:39.600 --> 29:44.880
clips with people. You can retweet tweets about the show, anything like that. All that support

29:44.880 --> 29:51.040
matters to us too. We also have a thing this year called boosting. In the past, we have talked a lot

29:51.040 --> 29:56.160
about like upgrading your membership and maybe you're not ready to move up to a new level this

29:56.160 --> 30:00.160
year, but you still want to give a little bit more to support the shows you love. You can do that by

30:00.160 --> 30:05.600
boosting, which allows you to incrementally increase your membership without having to move

30:05.600 --> 30:11.040
up to the next level. It won't qualify you for the rewards other than the bonus content because

30:11.040 --> 30:15.760
every member gets that. But it's a way to support a little bit more if you're looking to do that.

30:15.760 --> 30:24.240
How about another Yahoo from Yahoo Answers. Yahoo, the website, they do email and they

30:24.240 --> 30:28.640
do answers. Those are their two services they provide. This is one of the latter. It was sent

30:28.640 --> 30:36.240
in by Emma Camp. Thank you, Emma. So Yahoo Answers use James who asks, how do I get the most out of

30:36.240 --> 30:44.560
my time at the Olive Garden? We talk a lot about sort of like maximizing, exploiting the Olive

30:44.560 --> 30:49.840
Garden economy is this constant source of conversation on this show. We've talked about

30:49.840 --> 30:56.240
like minimum age requirements for even entering the Olive Garden facility, which is important.

30:56.240 --> 31:02.320
We've squared that away. This is more, listen, it's tough to get out to restaurants right now,

31:02.320 --> 31:10.320
isn't it? And by tough, I mean morally indefensible, but also tough. So when you're there,

31:10.320 --> 31:17.200
we know your family, but how can you really make each fucking moment matter?

31:17.920 --> 31:21.920
What's great about that question, Griffin, I'm so glad you brought it to the table,

31:21.920 --> 31:28.800
is like it is subjective in such a poignant way, right? Because one could argue pasta and bread

31:28.800 --> 31:35.040
are very filling, right? So you can't just say eat some pasta and breadsticks, right? Because then

31:35.040 --> 31:39.840
you're going to get full very quickly. But also counterpoint, you can't say just like eat some

31:39.840 --> 31:45.600
like lettuce and cherry tomatoes and get the most lettuce and cherry tomatoes you can, because are

31:45.600 --> 31:50.640
you really getting the most out of your Olive Garden experience? Yeah, so wait, now this is

31:50.640 --> 31:55.120
interesting. Instead of coming to a compromise between those two ideas, we should measure which

31:55.120 --> 32:00.400
one is the best. But just to say the two extremes are you enter the Olive Garden and never eat

32:01.040 --> 32:06.800
and never leave. They won't kick you out. It's a fucking Olive Garden. Yeah. You can just kind of

32:06.800 --> 32:13.280
ride your family. They cannot kick you out. You're their dad now. And you can just kind of chill

32:13.280 --> 32:17.440
and never eat and be there forever. And there you are making the most out of your time because you

32:17.440 --> 32:23.920
have given yourself infinite time. The alternative to that is you walk into the Olive Garden and they

32:23.920 --> 32:29.840
shoot you in the face with a spaghetti gun. And then you get what you get, you slam what you can

32:29.840 --> 32:36.720
slam, and you turn on your heels and walk right out the door. This is a lot like asking about

32:36.720 --> 32:41.360
life, Griffin, when you think about it. It's interesting that you say that. Yeah, should you

32:41.360 --> 32:49.200
live a timid life, but be in the Olive Garden for as long as you can, or lead an adventurous,

32:49.200 --> 32:55.040
aggressive life, but only have a limited time in the Olive Garden? Okay, you guys are fucking

32:55.040 --> 32:59.760
wasting time. When you first show up, you're going to be waiting for a table. Tell them,

32:59.760 --> 33:04.960
while you're waiting, you can get half off wine, okay? So that's one thing that you need to know

33:04.960 --> 33:09.440
right now. And I know that from my time as an employee. That's huge. That's going to be

33:09.440 --> 33:14.720
maximizing your budget and also your time. Well, before you even do that, though,

33:15.760 --> 33:23.040
be saying the word, be shouting the word spaghetti as you walk in the door. As you are in the

33:23.040 --> 33:30.960
vestibule, in the airlock from the front door to the door in, be saying spug, like ready to

33:30.960 --> 33:37.920
get it going. May I take it one step further? Please. Call as you're driving there and request

33:37.920 --> 33:43.920
that a server meet you outside with a basket of breadsticks so you can be eating the breadsticks

33:43.920 --> 33:50.960
as you walk into the building. Good. Have them hang breadsticks from string from the ceiling

33:50.960 --> 33:56.160
that you can nibble on as you sprint at full speed to the table they've prepared for you.

33:56.160 --> 34:01.120
Maybe you open your car door to drive to the Olive Garden. What's that on your driver's seat?

34:01.120 --> 34:08.000
Basket of breadsticks. Hey, hey, guys, I have stumbled on an article called Olive Garden Hacks,

34:08.000 --> 34:13.600
24 secrets straight from your server. Yes. Because I wanted to make sure that that half off wine

34:13.600 --> 34:20.000
thing was legit. I'm worried from the journey I'm about to take you guys on. I'm worried we're not

34:20.000 --> 34:25.120
going to have time to do the rest of the podcast, but I'm just going to. Now we do have some money

34:25.120 --> 34:31.520
zones. Should we go ahead and do the money zone? There's 24 secrets here. We got to cancel the ads.

34:31.520 --> 34:36.240
Yeah, we may not have time for the ads. Okay. There are some that are less wild, right? Split

34:36.240 --> 34:41.200
your meal with your partner in order to use two coupons at once. Okay, that's a little annoying,

34:41.200 --> 34:49.120
but sure. Here's the first one. Never pay full price for your kids to eat at Olive Garden.

34:49.120 --> 34:54.720
Olive Garden, about once every two months, two to three months, Olive Garden runs week-long

34:54.720 --> 34:59.120
promotions where kids can eat for only $1. Unless you just got to have those breadsticks now,

34:59.120 --> 35:02.800
I recommend waiting for these promotions. Can you imagine staring your kids straight in the

35:02.800 --> 35:06.720
fucking face and be like, they're like, mommy, can we go to Olive Garden? Like, well, when you

35:06.720 --> 35:13.280
cost a dollar, we can. Absolutely not. We're just going to keep aspiring to it. Don't buy the wine.

35:13.280 --> 35:19.440
Bring your own cheaper bottle instead. What? And you bring your own wine to Olive Garden. They're

35:19.440 --> 35:27.520
going to charge you a $7 corkage fee. That's insane. Okay. That's unbelievable that that

35:27.520 --> 35:35.280
structure is in place. For that to work, then that means that whatever bottle of wine you bring has

35:35.280 --> 35:45.760
to be at least $7.01 cheaper than what you were. Almost certainly, yes. The markup there has to be.

35:45.760 --> 35:51.520
You probably will be saving. Just the idea of being at Olive Garden and you reach into your

35:52.080 --> 35:58.240
giant cargo short pants and pull out from the cargo shorts, the pocket, a bottle of wine and

35:58.240 --> 36:03.840
say, I'll be paying a corkage fee for this wine I brought. Get this. You can sample up to three

36:03.840 --> 36:10.240
wines for free. The sample pour is three ounces. That can't be right. That's nine ounces of the

36:10.240 --> 36:17.760
good stuff. That can't be right. This is number 12 on this list. Employees get 50% off meals after

36:17.760 --> 36:22.320
their shift. This is one of the highest employee discounts I've seen. Considering a career in the

36:22.320 --> 36:27.280
restaurant industry and you love pasta, you're all set. That's not a tip. That's not so much a hack,

36:27.280 --> 36:34.320
really. That's a pivot of your life. Hey, honey, you want to go to either Olive Garden tonight?

36:34.960 --> 36:40.240
Give me a second to fill out this employment form online. Let me call my boss at the hospital to tell

36:40.240 --> 36:47.760
him I'm quitting being doctor. This person must have sold the article as 24 tips and then started

36:47.760 --> 36:53.920
to get really desperate because number 16 is ask your server to box up half your meal when they

36:53.920 --> 37:03.120
serve it to you. Voila, two meals. What? No. Not at all in any way, shape, or form is that the

37:03.120 --> 37:07.760
truth. And how is that an Olive Garden hack and not a just sort of like- That's a life hack.

37:07.760 --> 37:14.960
Yeah. Hey, when you bring me the meal, box up half of it before you bring it to the table.

37:15.520 --> 37:20.800
Someone's been doing their research. Yeah, you heard that you can get two meals for the sprites

37:20.800 --> 37:25.680
of one that way. Daddy, I'm doing my math homework. What's 16 divided by two? Oh, you mean like at

37:25.680 --> 37:34.640
Olive Garden? Okay, this is good. Order half and half soup if you can't decide which soup you want.

37:35.840 --> 37:39.680
Olive Garden has four different kinds of soup. You guys know, I'm saying with me, minestrone,

37:39.680 --> 37:48.560
chicken gnocchi, zuppa, Toscana, and pasta. How do you decide? You mix and match. Ask your server to

37:48.560 --> 37:54.960
mix the zuppa Toscana soup and the chicken gnocchi together, or enjoy the pasta e fagioli with the

37:54.960 --> 38:03.040
veggie heavy minestrone for less calories. So basically, your tip is to be a soup lunatic

38:03.040 --> 38:08.880
who just says, hey, I'm sure you worked on these recipes or whatever, but just go ahead and dump

38:08.880 --> 38:14.480
them all in one vat for me. And if you could bring a straw with that, I'd appreciate it.

38:14.480 --> 38:20.080
I just wanted to check and see if you guys were ready to order. Yes, could you ruin some soup

38:20.080 --> 38:28.160
for me, please? Of course, of course. You know what? How about just give me one fifth a portion

38:28.160 --> 38:34.320
of all five mixed together? Yes, of course. Yes, the soup mess, as we call it.

38:35.920 --> 38:43.280
I ask for an Italian soda, even though it's not on the menu. So it's not on the menu anymore,

38:43.280 --> 38:48.560
but you can order an Italian soda with the flavors from the Olive Garden lattes. I think that if you

38:48.560 --> 38:53.440
ordered an Italian soda from the server at Olive Garden, they would stare at you blankly and then

38:53.440 --> 38:58.800
lie on the ground until you left. All of these tips do seem to assume a certain level of engagement

38:58.800 --> 39:05.360
from the Olive Garden employee, that they wouldn't just say like, no. And the last tip here is buy

39:05.360 --> 39:12.000
Olive Garden dressing in grocery stores. So I guess maybe you could bring your own bottle of

39:12.000 --> 39:18.560
dressing and just pay the corkage fee on that. Like, oh no, I brought my own. Thank you.

39:19.360 --> 39:25.280
Now we really, really should go to the Money Town, though. All right, let's go. Come on.

39:25.280 --> 39:41.680
What more needs to be said? They're comfortable. Well, the ad has a lot of more.

39:41.680 --> 39:47.200
Okay, now I was trying to do like a prestige-y thing. What more needs to be said? They're

39:47.200 --> 39:52.000
comfortable, yes, but they also want you to be comfortable expressing yourself

39:52.000 --> 39:57.680
because they've dedicated, okay. Do you remember when I said let's try and get through these

39:57.680 --> 40:03.760
fast and now you're doing it like some sort of like damaged magician robot? I was trying to do

40:03.760 --> 40:09.600
it like it was like an Apple like presentation, okay. You sound like a broken clockwork man.

40:09.600 --> 40:13.920
Please do it faster. Meonies is dedicated to making the world's softest undies in classic colors,

40:13.920 --> 40:19.920
but also fun prints like dinosaurs and surfboards. I have ones that have slices of pizza on it

40:19.920 --> 40:24.720
that I really, really enjoy. Every time I put it on, it makes me feel like a real tubular dude.

40:25.440 --> 40:29.920
And these super soft fabrics start with sustainably sourced beechwood trees

40:29.920 --> 40:35.200
that magically turn from pulp to yarn to undies. And I never want anyone to explain to me how a

40:35.200 --> 40:41.760
tree becomes my underpants. They're just great. So if you want to try these tree-based underpants,

Celebrity wine why not?

41:55.440 --> 41:56.000
Huh.

41:56.000 --> 41:57.600
Celebrity wine why?

41:58.720 --> 42:00.240
This is the mashup.

42:00.240 --> 42:02.480
Ma- ma- mashup.

42:02.480 --> 42:10.960
Celebrity wine why squad? Welcome to Celebrity Wine Why Munch Squad. It's a podcast within a podcast

42:10.960 --> 42:14.960
within a podcast that profiles the latest and greatest in brand eating and wine.

42:15.600 --> 42:21.200
Um this is not a celebrity wine per se but it is a where the world's wine and the world of

42:21.200 --> 42:28.160
Munch Squad meet. Uh so this is uh extremely exciting for me uh to finally get these two

42:28.160 --> 42:32.960
great brands together and it's funny that I'm bringing two great brands together because uh

42:32.960 --> 42:37.040
thank you to Chris before I move on for sending this along. Um the pack is back.

42:37.040 --> 42:46.800
Cheez-It, White Cheddar, and Refreshing House Wine Rosé combine for two- a year two toast.

42:47.760 --> 42:54.320
Just in wine- just in time, sorry, unintentional pun, just in time for National Wine and Cheese Day,

42:54.320 --> 42:59.680
Cheez-It and House Wine, which are neither, uh offer the perfect summer pairing.

42:59.680 --> 43:07.200
The FOMO-inducing Cheez-It and Wine Box that had everyone buzzing last year is back.

43:07.200 --> 43:12.880
What? Wait, so remember when everyone was buzzing a year ago about this?

43:12.880 --> 43:18.080
But more than that the implication being that I might see perhaps some sort of influencer on

43:18.080 --> 43:25.360
Instagram enjoying this Cheez-It and Wine Box combination and I would be like oh god I'm so

43:25.360 --> 43:32.160
afraid I'm missing out. Yes. Okay. Uh this year's limited edition offers a brand new summer ready

43:32.160 --> 43:39.440
combination. Cheez-It, White Cheddar, and House Wine Rosé. Why do they continue to put the White

43:39.440 --> 43:46.480
Cheddar after Cheez-It? I don't know. That's very irritating. Made with 100% real cheese. Cheez-It,

43:46.480 --> 43:53.440
White Cracker- House Wine. House Wine. I mean with 100% real cheese. Cheez-It, White Cheddar,

43:53.440 --> 43:58.640
Crackers. I don't know man we keep squeezing the cheese and this incredible rosé keeps squishing

43:58.640 --> 44:07.120
out of it. Your guess is as good as mine dude but don't stop the cash cow. That's some slippery

44:07.120 --> 44:14.160
language made with 100% real cheese. All that is guaranteeing you is a single molecule of cheese

44:14.160 --> 44:20.160
at some point in the process. White Cheddar Crackers pair perfectly with the crisp refreshing

44:20.160 --> 44:27.280
flavor of House Wine Rosé. All in one convenient package. If your idea of convenience is carrying

44:27.280 --> 44:32.560
around a sloshy box of crackers from your living from your kitchen to your living room. And also

44:32.560 --> 44:38.080
definitely uneven weight right? There's no way. Oh for sure. For sure. The wine side must be heavier

44:38.080 --> 44:44.240
than the Cheez-It side. Yeah it's like an adult box of nerds. Uh it no secret it's no secret that

44:44.240 --> 44:50.240
rosé is the ideal beverage for peak of summer. That's true you know rosé used to be so we're

44:50.240 --> 44:54.880
looked down upon but there's a lot of great rosés. Are you saying it right and I've been saying it

44:54.880 --> 45:01.760
wrong all my life? How have you been saying it Travis? Rosé. Pink. But you're saying it like

45:01.760 --> 45:12.320
rosé. It doesn't matter. The crisp flavor of everyone's favorite summer drink. The tasty combo

45:12.320 --> 45:24.400
is perfect for socially distant happy hour. Hey boss. Imagine. Imagine the socially distanced

45:24.400 --> 45:32.400
party where the only the only concessions available are a single box of Cheez-It and wine.

45:32.960 --> 45:38.880
But which by the way um is distributed through a spigot on the front of the box which I would

45:38.880 --> 45:45.040
argue makes it the least perfect beverage to have at your socially distant happy hour.

45:45.040 --> 45:50.480
Now I will say just as far as like getting it across the room my friends and I did used to

45:50.480 --> 45:55.840
play space bag in college where we would take the bag out of the box of wine and hurl it across the

45:55.840 --> 46:00.800
room at each other yelling space bag and if you got hit by it you had to drink but if you caught

46:00.800 --> 46:06.800
it the other person had to drink. Yeah space bag. We know space bag. Yeah so you could get it across

46:06.800 --> 46:10.960
the room easily without having to get in within six feet of each other but as Justin has indicated

46:11.760 --> 46:16.800
there is a point in all space bag games where you have to put your mouth on a spigot. And that ain't

46:16.800 --> 46:24.000
gonna get the Fauci seal of approval. No the tasty combo is perfect for a socially distant happy hour

46:24.000 --> 46:30.160
a virtual book club or a cozy night on the couch. You know we all contain multitudes for sure but

46:30.160 --> 46:38.080
I'm not sure there's a huge demographic that loves books almost as much as they love chugging

46:38.080 --> 46:46.320
down dirty crackers with rotten strawberry water or a cozy night on the couch watching reality tv

46:46.320 --> 46:52.800
with a few friends. We're actually not doing that anymore. I don't know if you all actually heard

46:52.800 --> 46:56.160
that that's not actually what we're doing anymore. This is definitely someone who's writing this

46:56.160 --> 47:01.920
copy and they could think of two things and they're like and you know when everything reverts

47:01.920 --> 47:07.120
back to the way it was. You know these are for dirt bags too that don't give a shit about people

47:07.120 --> 47:14.160
they can enjoy our thing. And this is you it could be enjoyed by yelling while yelling at people in

47:14.160 --> 47:22.240
the supermarket. Following the success of our first edition of cheese it and wine which sold out in

47:22.240 --> 47:28.000
minutes. What? We knew we had to bring the partnership back this summer with a new flavor

47:28.000 --> 47:32.960
pairing said Jeff Delona senior director of marketing for cheese it. Was it sold online?

47:34.080 --> 47:39.040
Yeah it's just online only. White cheddar is a long-standing favorite of cheese it fans and what

47:39.040 --> 47:44.560
better match than light refreshing rose. Not only does it perfectly complement the cheesy goodness

47:44.560 --> 47:49.920
it's also the unofficial wine of summer. You could just call it the official wine of summer I don't

47:49.920 --> 47:54.960
think summer's gonna fucking suit you. Limited edition cheese it white cheddar and house wine

47:54.960 --> 48:04.640
rose will be available online for $29.99 at OriginalHouseWine.com beginning at 2 pm eastern

48:04.640 --> 48:11.680
on July 23rd. Don't worry it's already sold out. Oh okay cool I was worried because I knew I would

48:11.680 --> 48:17.440
have to look deep into my soul and and like decide if I was gonna buy it or not and I'm glad that they

48:17.440 --> 48:23.360
have saved me that level of introspection. Well Travis great news I have found listings for a box

48:23.360 --> 48:30.480
of house wine rose and a big box of cheese it's white cheddar and a listing for super glue.

48:32.240 --> 48:37.120
So you can kind of just do your own thing and I would argue that mine has double cardboard

48:37.120 --> 48:42.960
in there to protect from fluid cracker contamination. Yeah but Griffin if I do it myself

48:42.960 --> 48:49.360
that's nothing. There's I'm on the website where you go to order it and um I just got really sad

48:49.360 --> 48:54.400
for a second. Okay I missed it of course and they said our cheese it and house wine pairing boxes

48:54.400 --> 48:58.400
are sold out but don't worry we wouldn't leave you hanging. Click below to learn more about

48:58.400 --> 49:02.800
this collaboration and see our favorite house wine and cheese it cracker pairings so you can

49:02.800 --> 49:11.040
recreate it at home. Oh no. And I just feel like the idea the fact that they they didn't think

49:11.040 --> 49:18.960
that I could think of how to buy cheese it at home myself that I a human person would go to

49:18.960 --> 49:23.440
the store and be like well they're in different aisles I mean the law's the law I can't I can't

49:23.440 --> 49:32.160
recreate this at home. Help me help me brands fix this for me. It is also as if the the emperor

49:33.120 --> 49:38.960
was the one who's like look at my new clothes and also I'm naked because like you've just said like

49:38.960 --> 49:45.360
we didn't we just charged you money as Griffin put it to glue two things together you dummies

49:46.480 --> 49:50.800
you could do this you didn't need us to do the magic was in you all along.

49:52.080 --> 49:59.840
Uh I should point out that um the the regular box of wine from them cost $21.99.

50:00.720 --> 50:06.800
This box this partnership when it was available cost $30 so you are also buying a $9 box of

50:06.800 --> 50:12.400
cheese hits which is airplane. Uh they're white cheddar cheese hits so. Ah to be fair yeah that

50:12.400 --> 50:21.920
is absolutely true Griffin absolutely true um my advice to these two companies make more of them

50:22.480 --> 50:28.400
they keep selling out instantly if you like the money parts just go ahead and make more of them.

50:28.400 --> 50:32.640
Some. A lot more. Some human being who already thought that they were pretty

50:32.640 --> 50:41.360
eroded inside saw how quickly it sold out and thought should I have charged more for this?

50:42.160 --> 50:48.560
I yeah I already thought I was kind of pushing it with that $30 price tag but could I have been

50:48.560 --> 50:56.160
more of a dirtbag about this? I feel like I should have charged more. Yeah I already thought I was

50:56.160 --> 51:02.880
you know charging a lot of money for cheese hits but people seem to really want to spend this

51:02.880 --> 51:16.160
kind of money on cheese hits. Am I helping people? Wait a minute am I a hero? Um similar the the

51:16.160 --> 51:21.600
press release continues undaunted similar to the many varieties of cheese hit our wines run the

51:21.600 --> 51:27.680
full spectrum of flavor said Hal Landvoight winemaker for Housewine we've seen Rosé skyrocket

51:27.680 --> 51:33.120
in popularity over the past few years apparently skyrockets so much that we've had to duct tape

51:33.120 --> 51:39.280
into a box of cheese hits especially during the warm summer season for the second year of this

51:39.280 --> 51:44.880
partnership we knew the pairing had to feature Rosé as the perfect complement to the real cheese

51:44.880 --> 51:52.640
flavor in cheese it white cheddar. Okay. Um Housewine is the recipient of several Best Buy accolades

51:52.640 --> 51:59.200
um for which I'm assuming is uh Frank from Lost Prevention at my local Best Buy. You're gonna love

51:59.200 --> 52:06.320
this stuff. Cheesy and wine in one box uh from leading industry publications such as Wine Spectator

52:06.320 --> 52:12.480
and Wine Enthusiast which I'm assuming was in no way a joke. For additional details on this

52:12.480 --> 52:19.360
partnership uh be sure to visit cheezit.com and originalhousewine.com. Hey welcome back for this

52:19.360 --> 52:27.840
is year three of the cheese it house wine collabo this year uh bold step we just removed the divider

52:28.480 --> 52:34.800
so now it's just wine and cheese it's sloshing around in there and we're charging 140 dollars

52:34.800 --> 52:41.920
for oh it's sold out fuck it's gone fuck it's also we also just throw a random fucking Funko

52:41.920 --> 52:49.280
pop in there it's just a it's a sloppy soupy surprise box. Can you imagine there is a um

52:49.280 --> 52:57.680
there is a pairing uh uh guide on here on their website where how you can cheese it and cheers it

52:58.560 --> 53:06.800
and they of course have white cheddar and rosé they have extra cheesy and pinot grigio they have

53:06.800 --> 53:13.680
extra toasty and the sauvignon blanc they have original plus a nice red blend there's cheddar jack

53:13.680 --> 53:23.760
plus cabernet sauvignon um and then there's uh malbec and cheez-it grooves zesty cheddar

53:23.760 --> 53:31.120
rams and I just hope that somewhere in this world there was a 70 year old Argentinian man looking

53:31.120 --> 53:40.400
out over his uh malbec and thinking I just hope one day that my family's vineyard which has been

53:40.400 --> 53:46.080
in our family for generations and we've been fermenting this wine and I hope one day the malbec

53:46.080 --> 53:55.840
we make can be paired can be used to wash down cheez-it grooves zesty cheddar ranch that is my

53:55.840 --> 54:01.840
fondest hope this is what my grandpapa imagined when he uh planted this vineyard my grandpapa

54:01.840 --> 54:09.280
who is buried in this vineyard whose very life forces by my grandpapa who is part of the terror

54:09.920 --> 54:18.320
of of this uh this wine that we make can finally be uh used to wash down cheez-it grooves zesty
