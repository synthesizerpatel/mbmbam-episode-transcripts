00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:49.840
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me, an advice show for the

00:49.840 --> 00:56.400
modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

00:56.400 --> 01:00.320
And I'm Hollywood hitmaker, Griffin McElroy, the youngest brother.

01:00.320 --> 01:06.000
Well, boys, just got back from another meeting with the producers and director.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.560
Oh, of our podcast?

01:08.560 --> 01:14.720
Of our podcast. They have some big notes, especially as they're heading into Max Fun Drive.

01:16.160 --> 01:22.400
Last week, it was my heel turn. This week, they want more storylines. They said not enough

01:23.120 --> 01:24.240
storylines.

01:25.120 --> 01:25.440
Okay.

01:26.080 --> 01:29.840
Some more, it could be behind the scenes, it could be in front of the scenes,

01:29.840 --> 01:31.520
it could be in the middle of the scenes.

01:31.520 --> 01:35.280
Well, this is great news because I've just become like a sexy doctor.

01:35.280 --> 01:37.760
Like I've just become a sort of sexual doctor.

01:39.520 --> 01:43.200
That feels like two different things, Griffin, a sexy doctor versus a sexual doctor.

01:45.200 --> 01:50.480
Okay, so yeah, that's good, Trav. I don't like diagnosing give medicine to help people sexual.

01:50.480 --> 01:54.800
Do you know what I mean? It's just like my body looks good and all the patients are like,

01:54.800 --> 01:58.480
please. And I'm like, I can't. I am happily married.

01:58.480 --> 01:59.680
Okay.

01:59.680 --> 02:03.680
But I'm also, I'm pretty darn good at it. Like I can do an IV. Oh my God, guys,

02:03.680 --> 02:08.080
I had to get some blood work done yesterday, not COVID related, do not sweat.

02:09.760 --> 02:13.360
I'm going to continue to sweat as your brother because I don't know why you got blood work done.

02:13.360 --> 02:14.880
Yeah, just for funsies or?

02:14.880 --> 02:15.120
Yeah.

02:15.120 --> 02:20.880
It is an allergy panel. It's like the nerdiest imaginable reason to get blood work done.

02:20.880 --> 02:28.000
Yeah. Anywho, the person who was taking my blood was quite chatty,

02:28.000 --> 02:32.960
and that's their prerogative. I'm not here to, you know, shame them for that.

02:32.960 --> 02:38.240
But they were doing a lot of characters, I'll say. They were doing a lot of skit work,

02:38.240 --> 02:42.480
let's say. And at one point they were looking for my vein and they said,

02:42.480 --> 02:49.200
Ooh, that's a nice big juicy vein. Gonna get a lot of blood out of that.

02:49.200 --> 02:53.840
And started to do a vampire thing. And like for the remainder of,

02:53.840 --> 02:56.560
from the moment the needle entered my arm until the moment I left the room,

02:56.560 --> 03:00.400
she spoke in a vampire voice and she did, I swear to God.

03:00.400 --> 03:05.040
And it was one of the top five worst things that's ever happened to me,

03:05.040 --> 03:10.800
because can you two imagine a more sort of hostage scenario

03:11.600 --> 03:16.640
than having a needle in your body and you just can't, you can't move.

03:16.640 --> 03:21.360
And also they're going to try out some new SNL audition tape tactics on you.

03:21.360 --> 03:25.280
This is the difference between Griffin and I, because Griffin's,

03:26.320 --> 03:30.160
Griffin's, let's say fear here, Griffin's discomfort

03:30.160 --> 03:34.240
comes from him seeing this as this person trying out new material on him,

03:34.240 --> 03:38.960
where I would be thinking like, if I was a vampire,

03:39.600 --> 03:42.880
the job I would get would be drawing blood from people.

03:42.880 --> 03:45.920
Well, no. And so who's to say that

03:45.920 --> 03:49.920
this isn't the reveal? This isn't the prestige.

03:49.920 --> 03:52.240
I don't know how, it's a fair point, Travis,

03:52.240 --> 03:55.520
but like I can actually not imagine a worse job for a vampire

03:55.520 --> 03:57.120
because you're going to be so tempted by this shit.

03:57.120 --> 04:00.880
And I hope that this lab has their shit on lock enough

04:00.880 --> 04:03.040
that like if blood goes missing,

04:05.440 --> 04:08.560
I want my stuff on the books somewhere. I only have so much blood.

04:08.560 --> 04:12.400
Well, maybe they just take a little bit extra, you know,

04:12.400 --> 04:15.200
the juice is running and in this case, the juice is your blood.

04:15.200 --> 04:17.840
Sure. The juice is also running on the MaxFun drive,

04:17.840 --> 04:21.680
which we're going to talk about a little bit later on this episode.

04:21.680 --> 04:24.560
With this MaxFun drive has very chill vibes.

04:24.560 --> 04:27.120
That's the feedback we've been getting is a lot of people say that like,

04:27.120 --> 04:29.920
when we ask for money, it's like going on a beach vacation,

04:30.640 --> 04:33.760
which is so cool. And if you want to join the network now,

04:33.760 --> 04:35.520

04:35.520 --> 04:40.080

04:43.360 --> 04:45.040

04:53.040 --> 04:58.160
It's me, the head of the network, Reggie Big Shot.

04:59.440 --> 05:02.880
I heard you need a little drama to spice things up.

05:02.880 --> 05:10.000
Boy, here's some for you. Sorry, the cigars are catching up on me.

05:10.000 --> 05:10.560
Here's some.

05:10.560 --> 05:12.240
Please don't say that again.

05:12.240 --> 05:16.080
The cigars are catching up on me.

05:16.080 --> 05:17.520
They're catching up on you?

05:17.520 --> 05:18.880
Catching up on me.

05:18.880 --> 05:21.680
Listen, that's not the point. My personal health,

05:21.680 --> 05:22.960
that's not the point, kids.

05:22.960 --> 05:24.720
No, but I am worried about you. Are you okay?

05:24.720 --> 05:25.680
Yeah, I love you.

05:25.680 --> 05:29.360
I loved it when you were going to bring it at the beginning

05:29.360 --> 05:33.200
and the old days of ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am.

05:33.200 --> 05:38.640
I loved at the farm, farm jokes and you did a lot of blue stuff

05:39.280 --> 05:42.960
about lots of different marginalized groups of people.

05:42.960 --> 05:43.840
I love that.

05:43.840 --> 05:44.960
Loved that, yeah.

05:44.960 --> 05:46.560
You gave us a lot of positive feedback.

05:46.560 --> 05:49.120
I'm not so crazy about the new stuff.

05:49.120 --> 05:54.080
And honestly, boys, the well's running a little dry.

05:54.080 --> 05:55.680
So here's the deal.

05:55.680 --> 05:59.840
If you don't raise enough in this max fund drive

06:01.120 --> 06:06.560

13:22.240 --> 13:26.080
he was here like i didn't he didn't go down he didn't go down the stairs he just shut the door

13:26.080 --> 13:36.320
he's listening there okay great he kind of he stood there he fell well he tripped a little

13:36.320 --> 13:42.800
bit which is kind of does confirm my suspicions that he was quite drunk um during his appearance

13:42.800 --> 13:49.920
on this show should we do questions yeah that would be nice i was i was kind of enjoying just

13:50.720 --> 13:56.560
you know freeform a little bit but uh i'd love to i'd love to get in you know justice right

13:56.560 --> 14:04.800
fuck this show now the show can begin also my third i have a trip planned once things return

14:04.800 --> 14:14.960
to normal optimistic once things return to the new normal perhaps to go on once we've established a

14:14.960 --> 14:22.480
new society yeah uh once to go on a bachelor party on a houseboat as a prank we have purchased

14:22.480 --> 14:29.440
a dissolving swimsuit however we are at a loss as to how we can get the groom to wear in the

14:29.440 --> 14:38.400
water without him becoming suspicious what should we do that's from bear bummer in canada well good

14:38.400 --> 14:45.040
news is you've probably given yourself i don't know 36 months uh head start on this show we'll

14:45.680 --> 14:51.840
get the whiteboard out and we'll uh we'll start devising a an intricate an intricate plan now i

14:51.840 --> 14:58.720
am going to say i have not done any research into this perfect um but based off of things i know

14:58.720 --> 15:05.680
about things that dissolve i'm willing to bet that perhaps the quality of material of this swimsuit

15:05.680 --> 15:13.120
may be noticeably different dead giveaway situation yes standard swimsuit material

15:13.120 --> 15:18.400
not i'm going to live in fear every time i enter a body of water that i have been pranked and now

15:18.400 --> 15:26.320
my meat and two veg is about to pop out and that is no good i do think what it boils down to is

15:26.320 --> 15:32.720
uh of of top of my head presents to give i can think of i got you this swimsuit

15:33.760 --> 15:44.080
is uh it's a real left fielder that's a real curveball as they say uh i i can think of maybe

15:44.080 --> 15:50.000
two friends of mine but if they got me a really cool looking swimsuit but even then if i was a

15:50.000 --> 15:55.680
company that made dissolvable swimsuits i don't think i'd put a lot of time into the design

15:55.680 --> 16:02.240
process we gotta strike gifting the swimsuit like that's not gonna work and so now we're

16:02.240 --> 16:09.280
getting into a scenario where you have to steal all of his swimsuits and then when it's time to

16:09.280 --> 16:12.880
swim you're like oh don't worry you can borrow my pair actually that's it that's a fucking great

16:12.880 --> 16:18.400

17:31.680 --> 17:37.120
thread and the water dissolves the thread making the shorts just come away at the sides leaving

17:37.120 --> 17:42.720
your friend naked in the pool huh shorts can be worn as normal but within seconds of bin in water

17:42.720 --> 17:48.000
the fun starts watch your friend's face go from confused to embarrassed as he scrambles to cover

17:48.000 --> 17:53.760
up all you need to do is hide your friend's short best done before you get to hotel offer them your

17:53.760 --> 18:00.800
spare pair and it's all set try my full lifeguard set make your victim the pool lifeguard oh no

18:00.800 --> 18:07.040
jumps in same will happen no the other listings that's a fucking that's a fucking wild way of

18:07.040 --> 18:14.400
doing it yeah what a high risk scenario bachelor pool party hell yeah not you dylan i know it's

18:14.400 --> 18:20.240
your special time but you got to be the lifeguard that's what you do when a group of friends go

18:20.240 --> 18:28.000
swimming someone's got a lifeguard yes now i am watching a video of this happening oh trav trav

18:28.000 --> 18:36.800
and uh it's this poor man appears to be in the middle of a hotel like a very public place yeah

18:36.800 --> 18:44.480
as his clothing is actively failing him all right and i would say that this goes very quickly from

18:44.480 --> 18:51.760
oh he's got kind of a smirk on his face what is happening to i'm gonna get arrested i'm i'm in a

18:51.760 --> 18:57.440
public place and my all my bits are gonna be out we should probably make it clear the three of us

18:57.440 --> 19:06.240
are having a lot of fun here this is uh it sort of ethically reprehensible and genuinely uh should

19:06.240 --> 19:14.640
be a legal sort of uh thing and you shouldn't get your friend's privates out um as a joke uh

19:14.640 --> 19:18.960
that's that seems like that's we're all on the same page i didn't want people to write in and

19:18.960 --> 19:25.200
be like so you like this particular like this uh no it's inappropriate to get anyone's bits out

19:25.200 --> 19:34.240
without their explicit consent i will say they have a few more safety recommendations here

19:34.240 --> 19:44.880
oh boy how well mentioned first off is this at the end it says keep dry which yes iron iron on

19:44.880 --> 19:53.920
cool with no steam why the fuck am i ironing this on what for formal dissolving shorts occasions

19:53.920 --> 20:02.800
hey try on these crisp crisp yeah try my crisp pleated shorts do not let your ma'am wash them

20:02.800 --> 20:08.960
to make them nice for you going away yes this happened did it if the in the unlikely event

20:08.960 --> 20:14.160
of a problem with the shorts they must be returned for inspection that's a cool it's a cool gig yeah

20:14.160 --> 20:20.560
these shorts didn't fall apart i'm a failed dissolving shorts inspector i love it you gotta

20:20.560 --> 20:26.400
throw these away i'm watching the same video that travis is watching and it's just kind of a bummer

20:26.400 --> 20:32.400
because just all of his friends laughing and it's like get it your dick and he's like i yeah i guess

20:32.400 --> 20:37.120
so this youtube video is i'm now looking at a man's whole balls on youtube i didn't know you

20:37.120 --> 20:42.960
could do that on youtube yeah don't do this don't do this thing that's actually the easiest uh

20:42.960 --> 20:47.840
option i'm glad we all got there together uh can i do a yahoo you know what would be fun

20:47.840 --> 20:52.960
what's that you wear them and under those you have another slightly smaller pair of swim trunks

20:52.960 --> 20:58.640
that say like happy bachelor party they're not today friend but even that's a that's an even

20:58.640 --> 21:03.360
longer walk isn't it travis because it's like you have to make them think you're wearing dissolving

21:03.360 --> 21:08.720
swim trunks which they may not know is a thing so that's a hard seller just like boy i hope these

21:08.720 --> 21:12.880
don't dissolve when i get in the water like some swim trunks are named to have you guys heard about

21:12.880 --> 21:17.600
those dissolving syndromes these aren't them right you guys would tell me right yes these aren't my

21:17.600 --> 21:24.560
normal swim trunks but um do they feel funny here i go cannonball i don't know i'm gonna get i feel

21:24.560 --> 21:29.520
terrible i can't believe you my friends will do this to me when we're here to celebrate derrick's

21:29.520 --> 21:34.720
nuptials how could you we're all just trying to have a good time and you're trying to expose my

21:34.720 --> 21:41.520
genitals without my explicit consent look at this derricking gotcha gotcha my pp's not out nice try

21:41.520 --> 21:52.240
though um what are you talking about you pranked yourself chris yes and i almost had me here's a

21:52.240 --> 21:56.480
here's a yahoo that was sent in by several folks thank you everyone who sent this in it's yahoo

21:56.480 --> 22:05.280
answers user josh who asks what's next for knives yes knives are completely useless in this new age

22:05.280 --> 22:09.360
of guns and drones in my opinion they are going to have to change the designs of knives and add

22:09.360 --> 22:13.280
interesting and useful new features to compete with guns and drones what do you think is the

22:13.280 --> 22:18.880
next evolution of knives i enjoyed this question more before i read this additional information

22:18.880 --> 22:26.720
because i like knives more in the abstract rather than as hurting hurting tools tools for hurting

22:27.360 --> 22:33.200
i i would also argue that um knives still do things that guns and drones don't do

22:33.200 --> 22:42.400
oh sure yeah stab for one yeah cut yeah point poke poke that's a that's about a slash slice i

22:42.400 --> 22:51.120
mean that's about it no you like you use it to uh you know what if you are a a person who is lost

22:51.120 --> 22:57.040
in the wilderness it's a lot easier to use a knife to like cut down stuff for shelter than a drone

22:57.040 --> 23:04.560
uh or a gun yeah or a gun totally i think if you were ordering them knife would be easiest to cut

23:04.560 --> 23:13.280
down some branches then gun then drone in that order i think that the issue here is if you if

23:13.280 --> 23:18.560
they want to make cooler bigger better gun they can just make a bigger gun problem with knife

23:18.560 --> 23:25.600
you make a knife too big it's sword it's a sword so it still does need to be a knife

23:25.600 --> 23:31.040
um that's all proportions though isn't it hmm oh you're saying if you're a bigger person

23:31.600 --> 23:38.960
if the hilt is also gargantuan then you could still say that it's a knife yeah or you could

23:38.960 --> 23:46.400
have uh if if paul hogan's around you could if he says it's a knife he gets to indicate basically

23:46.400 --> 23:52.400
what's not a knife and what is a knife he's really busy yeah he is pretty busy i you know what i like

23:52.400 --> 23:57.520
you know what i like when they have those knives that do other things but they're not just knives

23:57.520 --> 24:03.360
it's like here's knives in here and also uh it's a bottle opener and also it's got like a little

24:03.360 --> 24:09.520
wrench in there that's fun to me but maybe they take it further and it's like it's a knife and

24:09.520 --> 24:15.360
it's a sandwich right or like it's a knife and oh god oh wait this is topical let me try again can

24:15.360 --> 24:20.160
i try again yeah please it's a knife the knife sandwich thing was uh pretty stupid okay but let

24:20.160 --> 24:24.880
me try let me try let me try again this is really topical with uh a lot of viral stuff that's been

24:24.880 --> 24:29.920
going on on the internet right now so uh okay it's it's a knife but then you go to pick it up it's

24:29.920 --> 24:38.400
cake what okay this is actually a perfect thing is it yeah this is a perfect time for me to stop

24:38.400 --> 24:45.520
the entire show and at i missed it the thing that the inception of it and i only caught the after

24:45.520 --> 24:52.720
shocks of that particular meme and it has it before i i couldn't piece together that it was

24:52.720 --> 24:57.920
some sort of meme and i thought i was kind of losing it for just a little bit so what's going

24:57.920 --> 25:01.840
on there with that go ahead and walk me through that please well it all began that sounds pretty

25:01.840 --> 25:07.360
boring are you sure you want him to do that if he could do it in 12 seconds it began with a viral

25:07.360 --> 25:11.760
video where it's like oh this looks like a roll of toilet paper no we're cutting into it it's cake

25:11.760 --> 25:16.400
this looks like a bottle of lotion oh we're cutting into it it's cake but at no point did

25:16.400 --> 25:20.320
they say look at this it looks like cake no it's actually a roll of toilet paper that would have

25:20.320 --> 25:28.160
been way more impressive to me that's true i can wipe my butt with a kick uh i'm sorry i'm gonna

25:28.160 --> 25:32.560
stop the podcast i'm gonna stop the stopping the podcast to say griffin walk me through that real

25:32.560 --> 25:39.760
quick i don't want to fuck this this episode in particular has been like here's a funny awesome

25:39.760 --> 25:47.680
badass thing that i just said and you're like show your work fuck that i think uh we've danced

25:47.680 --> 25:53.440
around what's next for knives and what we can do is sort of knife innovators sharper i think you're

25:53.440 --> 26:00.800
you eventually you reach a sort of like atomic like limit there like a sort of a sort of like

26:00.800 --> 26:06.640
you can split an atom right and that's dangerous because those motherfuckers are all over the place

26:06.640 --> 26:14.960
uh so second like a second blade but oh i've got it like a but but running perpendicular

26:14.960 --> 26:19.680
to the first blade or like coming out the side of the hilt or back on the back like you're uh

26:19.680 --> 26:26.880
like you're um uh the freaking red the guy the gentleman from uh phantom menace yep

26:26.880 --> 26:37.840
ms mr maul i believe is his name dr maul esqire i knew he was a zebrack but i couldn't remember

26:37.840 --> 26:46.480
his name that's fucked up now i i let me pitch this i i and i'm gonna picture it try to describe

26:46.480 --> 26:52.080
it and i don't understand how the inner workings would you know work but imagine a tube right and

26:52.080 --> 26:57.280
you load the knife into it and it is pressurized in some way that you can release that pressure

26:57.280 --> 27:02.800
and the knife shoots forth from the tube and bears itself into whatever you're pointing it at

27:03.680 --> 27:09.600
i mean i'm again i was more thinking about kitchen innovations but i have had some trouble

27:09.600 --> 27:16.560
with sweet potatoes that i imagine knife gun would help me out with damn you think whoever

27:16.560 --> 27:23.200
invented the bayonet was like i'm gonna take the rest of the year off this is the best guys guys

27:23.200 --> 27:29.120
guys guys guys check it out you know how we since we got gun and like we've just been sort of rolling

27:29.120 --> 27:34.720
over like hulk me has been going wild since we got gun but we all kind of still miss sword

27:36.320 --> 27:42.880
check it the fuck out i did a kick-ass job today uh i i enjoyed that in the movie the old guard

27:42.880 --> 27:47.200
did you guys see that flag with charlie's throne and a bunch of other people in it no no um yeah

27:47.200 --> 27:52.160
it was good and they they they've been alive for a very long very long time and they're very good

27:52.160 --> 28:00.960
at murder and they always bring gun but then also ax is with them they bring ax too and it

28:00.960 --> 28:08.000
seems weird sitting point out like gun can't do everything they need to do they they need

28:08.000 --> 28:14.320
ax still to to come to come to the party i wonder if it's like a security ax like it just makes you

28:14.320 --> 28:21.920
feel better i guess well if gun acts up and turns against you it's like a little old lady who used

28:21.920 --> 28:28.080
an ax to chop up all her guns exactly there's not a lot of moving parts in ax you know it's hard

28:28.080 --> 28:34.480
there's not a lot of points of failure for ax gun who even knows how that who knows what the fuck's

28:34.480 --> 28:42.480
going on in there it's like my computer stick heavy part sharp edge done we love it you know

28:42.480 --> 28:48.480

30:53.360 --> 30:57.760
about to it's so funny i was about to say it and then you can i can i get a hand on the ball yeah

30:57.760 --> 31:05.840
trap yeah i desire another question to be delivered to me upon a platter of gold it can never just be

31:06.480 --> 31:14.640
the thing the finest questions no humanity bring me up a spoke question uh my mom texted me today

31:14.640 --> 31:20.480
and said she wanted to get into bitcoin she asked me whether it was a good investment and she started

31:20.480 --> 31:25.200
small i don't know why she wants to get involved with this stuff and i'm pretty sure bitcoin is a

31:25.200 --> 31:32.160
scam my question is is it ethical to help my only mother invest in investing cryptocurrency and that's

31:32.160 --> 31:39.200
from cryptoskeptic all money is a scam when you think about it guys go off because it's all just

31:39.200 --> 31:49.120
made up bits and boops bullshit oh this piece of paper is worth this much metal go off go off it's

31:49.120 --> 31:58.880
fucking nothing that said i think bitcoin is even more so bitcoin is absolute i mean yes but okay

31:58.880 --> 32:04.720
i can answer some of these questions i i know the exact right time to get into bitcoin was three

32:04.720 --> 32:11.600
months ago every single time at any point in history the right time to do it was before you

32:11.600 --> 32:18.800
ever started uh doing it right so so that that is that was a challenge bitcoin is one of those

32:18.800 --> 32:26.400
blind spots for me where if someone who was older came to me and said so justin what is

32:26.400 --> 32:32.800
the deal with bitcoin i feel like i would have to just sort of freeze in this and remain perfectly

32:32.800 --> 32:38.560
still and silent until they thought i was something was wrong with me and they left the room because

32:38.560 --> 32:45.440
that would be so complete would be my ignorance that i think it would lower my stock sort of

32:45.440 --> 32:50.960
permanently in there like when their internet broke right they wouldn't come to the j man they

32:50.960 --> 32:56.640
wouldn't listen to my recommendations on tv shows like any well and the problem is is even if you

32:56.640 --> 33:01.680
were able to explain it to them they would believe you less it would they would it would

33:01.680 --> 33:05.920
seem more like you were fucking with them than if you just stood there silent like a statue

33:05.920 --> 33:13.120
because the truth is bitcoin basically boils down to um i'm gonna send you a jpeg and i'm gonna tell

33:13.120 --> 33:18.000
you how much that jpeg is worth then someone else is gonna say hey give me that jpeg and then i'm

33:18.000 --> 33:23.120
gonna tell you how much that jpeg is worth it's it's it's all based on like perceived i'm actually

33:23.120 --> 33:28.480
feeling more calm listening to you talk makes me feel more confident yeah right i actually travis

33:28.480 --> 33:33.920
thank you i do feel like thank you for cheering me up i do feel better uh listening to you try

33:33.920 --> 33:39.280
to explain that's all it is it's all perceived desperately clutch at any sort of cognizant

33:39.280 --> 33:46.640
thoughts about bitcoin perceived value because the irony is as we these three goobers sit here

33:46.640 --> 33:52.000
and even just say every time we say the word bitcoin bitcoin becomes a little more valuable

33:52.640 --> 33:57.360
it's just it increases a little bit because it's like i've heard about bitcoin that's something

33:57.360 --> 34:03.840
right that is something that is all it is i can't get your mom into it now she'll be rich in five

34:03.840 --> 34:11.520
days i uh heard through the grapevine about the uh very serious twitter hack that happened last

34:11.520 --> 34:17.680
week where uh a bunch of different big accounts got got and those big accounts did ask people

34:17.680 --> 34:26.560
to send them bitcoin and it's bad it's a terrible uh it's a terrible invasion of privacy and given

34:26.560 --> 34:33.200
twitter's sort of uh global political importance i guess that's like a harrowing thing but i do

34:33.200 --> 34:39.440
just want to dial in uh-huh that this probably did work on some people some people were uh

34:39.440 --> 34:45.680
successfully bamboozled by this and i do wonder if barack obama's tweet president barack hussein

34:45.680 --> 34:51.040
obama a lot of people forget about these things important to me if he got anybody with i am giving

34:51.040 --> 34:55.200
back to my community due to covet 19 all bitcoin sent to the address below will be sent back

34:55.200 --> 34:59.280
doubled if you send back one thousand dollars i will send back two thousand dollars then there's

34:59.280 --> 35:04.480
the bitcoin link then president barack hussein obama said only doing this for the next 30 minutes

35:04.480 --> 35:13.440
enjoy why really why does me why does barack have all of this bitcoin saved up why does he do that

35:13.440 --> 35:18.000
why is he doubling it why is it just for the net why is he doing a supermarket sweep

35:18.000 --> 35:26.160
bonus round why did he tell me to enjoy sending him the money so he can double the money how

35:26.160 --> 35:31.360
why would that be the only exchange why not just i'll send you let me hey say hey and i'll send

35:31.360 --> 35:37.680
you some bitcoin why is the exchange part necessary at all i am giving back to my community

35:37.680 --> 35:44.800
my community of people who have and know what bitcoin is enjoy for 30 minutes i'm your president

35:44.800 --> 35:51.360
barack obama and your former president and i do want you to send me the bitcoin but do not sweat

35:51.360 --> 35:56.960
because i'm going to send back twice as much as you send me i know what bitcoin is you see these

35:57.840 --> 36:04.560
swordfish sunglasses i'm wearing and i want you to enjoy this and my cousin doug has a great

36:04.560 --> 36:11.280
investment opportunity that he says is a sure thing so all i need is your bitcoin and then i

36:11.280 --> 36:18.800
will invest in this slug racing circuit and then i oh shit we're broke ah damn it fucking billy

36:18.800 --> 36:24.320
gates tweets it fucking elon musk tweets it and is like hey i have bitcoin come and get it

36:24.320 --> 36:31.520
for 30 minutes enjoy then i think like those fucking nerds probably know what's up president

36:31.520 --> 36:38.800
barack obama swooping in and being like i also have bitcoin come get it 30 minutes baby i've got

36:38.800 --> 36:45.440
30 minutes worth of bitcoin travis um i'd love to dive more into your knowledge of an understanding

36:45.440 --> 36:54.560
of bitcoin um so griffin do you understand bitcoin mining uh it's where they use graphics cards to

36:54.560 --> 37:00.160
get the bitcoin and keep me from being able to find the graphics cards travis can you tell me

37:00.160 --> 37:06.400
how computers make bitcoins with bitcoin mining and i griffin yeah i want you to judge and i want

37:06.400 --> 37:11.040
i want you to hear travis's and then i want you to hear the real answer and then you judge which is

37:11.040 --> 37:16.400
just fucking wild now okay i want everyone to know i could do the thing where i'm like i don't

37:16.400 --> 37:23.280
fucking know i'm a cool jock but i'm going to do my best purely yes please from context yes

37:23.280 --> 37:31.360
i'm going to say bitcoin mining is when there's like some ai just searching around the web looking

37:31.360 --> 37:36.720
for just it's kind of like the loose change of bitcoin wherever there's like point zero zero

37:36.720 --> 37:42.240
zero zero zero zero zero one percent of a bitcoin or whatever that someone has like forgotten about

37:42.240 --> 37:47.040
or maybe while they were doing a transaction it got rounded down or up or whatever and that

37:47.040 --> 37:55.680
that ai just scoops it on up and saves it for this sounds fucking wrong okay so here's the right answer

37:55.680 --> 38:06.080
here so you get a there's all these really hard math problems okay on the bitcoin network there's

38:06.080 --> 38:12.240
all these really hard math problems and they're so hard that the computer has to both work very hard

38:12.240 --> 38:20.480
but also get lucky to solve it and the the um the chances against them doing it is like one in 13

38:20.480 --> 38:26.640
trillion so it's very unlikely that they can solve this very hard math problems but if they do they

38:26.640 --> 38:37.840
win a prize okay wait so hold on so there's a computer goodwill hunting its way through a

38:37.840 --> 38:47.280
website and like standing before the whiteboard and trying to get lucky which what that even means

38:47.280 --> 38:52.800
in the terms of computing is both baffling and terrifying to me and the computer is trying to

38:52.800 --> 39:01.280
get lucky and if a computer solves a math problem a very hard yes thank you really can't very hard

39:01.280 --> 39:09.040
math problem it gets some the computer gets some with the prize yes well i mean technically belongs

39:09.040 --> 39:15.520
i'm sure i mean the computer does not have rights whoa all right all right but so its owner would

39:15.520 --> 39:24.720
own the uh um you know the bitcoin but yes that is that is how i understand it is that the computer

39:25.360 --> 39:29.680
the computer doesn't really does a bunch of hard math and eventually gets it right and gets a

39:29.680 --> 39:38.960
little prize that's a bitcoin huh i think amazingly and i i this is of course uh completely subjective

39:38.960 --> 39:45.840
but i think my answer made more sense than the thing you said justin's envisions a world that

39:45.840 --> 39:51.360
makes me much happier because is there some sort of deranged mathematician trillionaire somewhere

39:51.360 --> 40:00.080
that's like i i cannot die until these impossible formulae have been um discovered who this is

40:02.800 --> 40:08.720
who makes the question bitcoin makes the question no okay they only really they only release

40:08.720 --> 40:17.360
a few but okay this is not fuck this is fucking true they only release a little bit of extra

40:17.360 --> 40:24.080
puzzle bonus puzzles they release the puzzles on the back of their menus they release the

40:24.080 --> 40:31.760
puzzles in what's called a block reward and the block reward is halved every uh 210 000

40:31.760 --> 40:41.040
blocks around every four years so in 2009 it was 50 in 2013 it was 25 in 2018 it was 12.5

40:41.680 --> 40:47.920
and uh somewhere this year it'll be 6.25 right so they only release a few puzzles

40:48.720 --> 40:54.320
a few new puzzles they're releasing less puzzles just to get the bitcoin out there but who's

40:54.320 --> 41:03.360
making up the puzzles justin the the computer creates the so the computer creates a puzzle

41:03.360 --> 41:07.120
it can't this is this is probably the creator can be surprised i can't solve and also the

41:07.120 --> 41:13.920
puzzles get harder every two weeks they just throw an extra three in there i didn't know there's

41:13.920 --> 41:30.640
three in okay this was an x but now it's a z fuck you you are you are 44 000 times more likely to

41:30.640 --> 41:35.760
win the powerball jackpot with a single lottery ticket then you are to pick the correct hash

41:35.760 --> 41:41.360
on a single try which is the correct putt to solve this fucking puzzle you will not solve

41:41.360 --> 41:50.640
this puzzle do they have any word searches no it's all jumbled but it's hard but it's hard ones

41:50.640 --> 41:58.000
they're like this is like nine letters so hopefully that helps hey just let your mom listen

41:58.880 --> 42:05.760
10 minutes she's out just just in case our investments in bitcoin don't uh pay out i would

42:05.760 --> 42:22.720
like to invite us all for a quick sojourn to uh to the money real quick before we do ads folks

42:22.720 --> 42:26.800
this just occurred to me that you might have listened to that whole cryptocurrency section

42:26.800 --> 42:31.280
and thought you know that's not like a cry for help from the macro so i should explain how

42:31.280 --> 42:37.680
cryptocurrency works to them and uh you you would be wrong oh wow what a swing and a miss that

42:37.680 --> 42:42.880
interpretation would be you could not be further off my friend nope actually you know what i'm

42:42.880 --> 42:47.120
perfectly happy where i'm at i'll say i'll say this if you do you do need those just dump them

a test because if you send it to us we'll know you skip the ass yeah oh yeah and that and it

43:09.680 --> 43:17.040

travis man my throat is still messed up man it's terrible um so hey this one comes to us from the

46:45.600 --> 46:54.880
uk and this is weird because normally the uk does not make it into a lot of um a lot of munch squads

46:54.880 --> 46:59.680
but this one is from heinz uk and so it was sent to me by graham roebuck who just all around jeez

46:59.680 --> 47:09.280
just the all-arounder can't be stopped salad cream ice cream huh heinz launches heinz creams

47:09.280 --> 47:16.880
DIY ice cream kits now it's important for you to know heinz creams is with a z is z at the end

of heinz so a z at the end of cream what's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander uh july is

47:23.040 --> 47:29.040

year heinz has launched a selection of diy ice cream kits using a range of heinz sauces you can

47:36.800 --> 47:42.960
make your very own heinz creams at home and celebrate national ice cream month from the

47:42.960 --> 47:49.760
comfort of your kitchen so you go to their fucking website and there's a there's a place right there

47:49.760 --> 47:56.640
where the crime is where you it says click here to do crime uh-huh and when you click it you go to

47:56.640 --> 48:04.400
a page that is heinz creams and um if you let's say you wanted the mayo cream and i and i don't

48:04.400 --> 48:11.520
and i and i don't but let's say you did relish the creamy taste of heinz good mayonnaise

48:14.960 --> 48:20.480
it's actually heinz seriously good mayonnaise but the seriously is in brackets so i took it

48:20.480 --> 48:26.240
upon myself to leave it out for comedic effect relish the creamy taste of heinz you can't say

48:26.240 --> 48:31.280
we're talking about toppings you probably shouldn't use relish no as a as your okay relish

48:31.280 --> 48:36.880
the creamy taste of heinz seriously good mayonnaise in an ice cream this make your own heinz creams

48:36.880 --> 48:43.040
kit includes the equipment you'll need to make a heinz mayonnaise ice cream it includes heinz good

48:43.040 --> 48:50.320
mayonnaise sauce a branded gift box a recipe card what if it didn't have that yeah it's like i don't

48:50.320 --> 48:54.960
know you fucking figure it out here's some mayonnaise and a win and it's not pre-measured

48:54.960 --> 49:00.560
let's be honest it seems like portions are way off it's wild i feel like the person writing this

49:00.560 --> 49:06.720
press release had benjamin button disease and jack disease because it's like with each paragraph

49:06.720 --> 49:12.880
they're sort of like age seems to be going backwards put good mayonnaise in cream sauce

49:12.880 --> 49:21.360
in ice cream yay it also includes a reusable ice cream tub uh that's profane so you make mayonnaise

49:21.360 --> 49:26.960
ice cream in it then you're like don't don't don't toss that vicki i'm gonna save that i

49:26.960 --> 49:34.400
want to use it again for anything else and lastly a limited edition engraved golden scoop and spoon

49:34.400 --> 49:37.760
it doesn't say what's engraved on it but i'm assuming it's the word perfect

49:40.960 --> 49:46.480
i can only imagine um so let's go back to this press release here uh i will let you

49:46.480 --> 49:53.360
know i'm looking at the website and the bad news is that the heinz ketchup creams

49:53.360 --> 50:01.840
is sold out i can't get that anymore you can get bbq creams huh you can get saucy sauce creams

50:02.880 --> 50:09.360
these are all challenging there's a saucy sauce creams and then there's heinz salad creams what

50:09.360 --> 50:15.120
is salad cream it's a tangy taste it's like uh salad dressing no i think i put that together

50:15.120 --> 50:20.800
but like there's lots of different types of salad dressing well this is salad cream you get it it's

50:20.800 --> 50:28.000
it's like it would be a good ice cream is is the good way to imagine it um so they've they've

50:28.000 --> 50:34.880
listed the it says the tangy taste of salad creams makes it one of britain's most loved sauces and

50:34.880 --> 50:39.600
now it's a heinz creams that zing we all know and love can be paired with the delicious sweetness

50:39.600 --> 50:47.760
of summer strawberries on top of refreshing ice cream huh um heinz bbq creams is sweet sticky and

50:47.760 --> 50:54.960
tongue tinglingly delicious oh water and flavor of classic heinz bbq sauce in a heinz creams

50:54.960 --> 50:59.680
teamed with maple syrup pecans and perhaps a sprinkling of bacon bits and this sweet and

50:59.680 --> 51:05.520
smoky ice cream will really pack a punch hey just real quick when i put something on my tongue

51:06.400 --> 51:14.800
if the reaction my tongue has is to tangle that is body that is poison that is bad body to reject

51:14.800 --> 51:22.320
it that is a bad thing to happen oh it's my whole mouth is buzzing um david chalbert the senior

51:22.320 --> 51:29.120
brand manager at heinz sauce says this summer is looking different for many of us and while we might

51:29.120 --> 51:34.160
be staycationing or staying at home more than in other years it doesn't mean you have to miss out

51:34.160 --> 51:40.320
on the joys of a good ice cream heinz sauces are here to help hey david honestly you're right about

51:40.320 --> 51:46.320
the first part this summer is looking different for but fuck you for thinking the answer is do

51:46.320 --> 51:50.800
you want to make a ice cream out of mayonnaise does that fix it yeah everything's up in the

51:50.800 --> 51:58.880
air now ice cream out of mayonnaise did we fix it it can't hurt right listen everything's fucked

51:58.880 --> 52:03.680
do you want to make ketchup ice cream in your own house we've tried no one's no one's watching no

52:03.680 --> 52:08.640
one's watching anything goes they think of it this way once it's all back to the new normal

52:08.640 --> 52:13.440
you're probably not going to want to make salad cream ice cream you probably won't do that you'll

52:13.440 --> 52:21.120
be so happy to return to this to the life you knew we give you the ultimate summer mashup heinz

52:34.000 --> 52:43.120
distancing david fuck off it's not the ultimate summer mashup you absolute maniac it's ketchup

52:43.120 --> 52:50.640
mixed with ice cream stop it we might we know it might seem like a bit of a crazy combo to some

52:51.440 --> 52:58.720
but with heinz always at the forefront of innovation anything is possible hey david if

52:58.720 --> 53:05.280
if anything is possible could i request a vaccine could that be first on your list

53:05.280 --> 53:10.960
you fucking ketchup wizard you think if anything is possible you think when david turned in the

53:10.960 --> 53:16.800
first draft of this press release press release somebody said like do we want to add any qualifiers

53:16.800 --> 53:22.400
here where you just said forefront of innovation do we want to put like forefront of like dressing

53:22.400 --> 53:30.400
innovation or something yeah sauce innovation no innovation no anything is possible we're the

53:30.400 --> 53:36.640
bleeding edge of all technology both food and medical and we're gonna make this summer work for

53:36.640 --> 53:45.280
you if you this is just like the bud light um the bud light asking robin robin things if if i call

53:45.280 --> 53:51.120
you and i'm like hey this has all been really hard for everybody i'm just checking in to see

53:51.120 --> 53:57.520
how you're doing what are you up to and you say i'm making mayonnaise ice cream i'm going to call

53:57.520 --> 54:02.080
the authorities to come like check on you yeah because i'm worried that something has gone

54:02.080 --> 54:09.760
terribly wrong i bet it's good though it's probably good is the one where you said the

54:09.760 --> 54:17.760
bacon bits that got me a little bit the bbq ice cream with some bacon bits and pecans yeah i mean

54:17.760 --> 54:24.560
yeah i'd be pretty good listen if i could order these to america i probably already would be

54:24.560 --> 54:31.760
i find that i find the idea like the ketchup and barbecue sauce i can almost i can almost see my

54:31.760 --> 54:37.680
no i'll see you away there we're into like it's mayonnaise like that's hard that gets a little

54:37.680 --> 54:43.520
more challenging if it's like mayo creams and just the number of z's on this page guys it's

54:43.520 --> 54:50.080
quite a it's tough there's a there is a lot of z's in this in this i bet a thousand island ice

54:50.080 --> 55:00.480
cream 45 z's on the page um hey can i do another yahoo yeah yeah of course um geez i got a two

55:00.480 --> 55:08.560
here i'm debating which one's the best i mean i don't know that this one is the most sort of gut

55:08.560 --> 55:12.720
bustingly funny but it is a conversation that i'm curious about that i feel like justin's going to

55:12.720 --> 55:17.760
have a lot to say uh sent in by several people again it's by yahoo answers user misty who asks

55:17.760 --> 55:26.800
what is the best place to work in at the mall huh well the answer i think is obvious but

55:26.800 --> 55:31.120
i just want to fucking talk about this i just kind of want to send jokes out yeah can we just

55:31.120 --> 55:36.480
send jokes out of the room for about 75 minutes earlier in the episode so i think there's a

55:36.480 --> 55:44.000
precedent established okay you know what let's just say i was in all i a jokes fuck off yeah

55:44.000 --> 55:50.480
fuck off we're gonna settle this i have worked a couple mall jobs do you call your phone jokes

55:51.840 --> 55:56.080
no i don't call my phone jokes that's a very good idea though if i could program it to be like hey

55:58.080 --> 56:05.280
stop it i i've worked several mall jobs and i think right now don't need your bonafides

56:05.280 --> 56:08.720
just need an answer if i was going to pick a mall job i think it would be

56:09.760 --> 56:18.800
like a cell phone case kiosk whoa what yeah it feels low impact like i don't think you're dealing

56:18.800 --> 56:24.960
with customers left and right it's a very narrow window of information you have to be briefed on

56:25.840 --> 56:32.000
you get to sit down for a lot of it very little oversight over what you do most of the time when

56:32.000 --> 56:37.520
i see people working there they're like on their phones or in some cases even like you playing

56:37.520 --> 56:42.400
games travis you've just hit the you've just hit the biggest issue with it when i see people working

56:42.400 --> 56:46.240
there if you put yourself into the cell phone kiosk what you've basically done is put yourself

56:46.240 --> 56:52.000
into a human zoo yeah you are an exhibit at the mall museum constant constant scrutiny everyone

56:52.000 --> 56:56.240
looking at you what are they looking at the phone what are they up to and it's that thing of like

56:56.960 --> 57:00.160
that judgy thing that people do where it's like i can't believe they're on their phone when they

57:00.160 --> 57:04.080
were just on their phone like 15 seconds ago and they just don't happen to be on their phone right

57:04.080 --> 57:08.400
at that exact second they're it's an incredible level of scrutiny it'd be a terrible job you've

57:08.400 --> 57:14.240
picked arguably one of the one of the most stressful i mean i disagree only because i

57:14.240 --> 57:21.280
stand by the low oversight thing like that for me and any job i've ever had is a boss who is looking

57:21.280 --> 57:25.200
to make themselves especially in a retail environment looking to make themselves feel

57:25.200 --> 57:30.160
essential and so they are just looking for things to point out so that they feel like they're doing

57:30.160 --> 57:35.600
their job if you're at the cell phone kiosk or the hillshire farms kiosk or any kiosk your boss

57:35.600 --> 57:40.000
is going to be able to fucking clock you from a hundred yards they can monitor your progress

57:40.000 --> 57:45.040
without you even there are no corners there's not the telltale like who's what what kiosk boss is

57:45.040 --> 57:49.840
like checking in if you own a kiosk i think you didn't buy it because you were ready to be super

57:49.840 --> 57:56.320
hands-on travis they're the face of super sterling silver of course i'm going to check on them they

57:56.320 --> 58:01.520
are the front line of customer interaction and i'm i'm in charge of making sure that our customers

58:01.520 --> 58:07.360
always walk away with silver and a smile there is a chaos whatever engraved gift as the uh at the

58:07.360 --> 58:14.320
uh kinwood town center here in cincinnati where the product that they sell is glass cubes where

58:14.320 --> 58:20.720
the center of them has been laser etched with some kind of photograph of perhaps a beloved pet

58:20.720 --> 58:27.520
or a child or a memaw that you want to remember and i see that every time i go to the kinwood

58:27.520 --> 58:33.120
mall and i think that's a front for something there's no way that they sell enough engraved

58:34.240 --> 58:38.400
what are you doing today going to the mall cool can i come along sure i guess if you want to watch

58:38.400 --> 58:45.760
me stand around and look at cubes for an hour well i'm trying to i'm trying to pick the perfect

58:45.760 --> 58:53.280
grandma tesseract uh i'm trying to i'm locking my grandma in this in this holocron she's wronged

58:53.280 --> 59:03.360
krypton and i need to yeah yep haven't seen memaw since i banished her to the phantom zone all that

59:03.360 --> 59:10.160
that's my memaw's horcrux 29.99 at the kinwood mall believe it or not uh okay so that's incorrect

59:10.160 --> 59:16.320
griffin i mean here's what's here's here's what's making this tough for me uh i feel like uh like

59:16.320 --> 59:22.800
an auntie ans is is thrilling you see an auntie ans and then you probably do i assume you get to

59:22.800 --> 59:28.240
eat some auntie ans at some point or at least you get like a dope discount but at at what point i

59:28.240 --> 59:32.400
love the smell of an auntie ans down the you know wafting down an airport terminal or something like

59:32.400 --> 59:40.480
that sure but that smell i imagine after i'm gonna be really generous and say like three weeks is

59:40.480 --> 59:45.440
going to be like a complete nightmare i'll see any any any restaurant any food service you are

59:45.440 --> 59:51.920
going to run into that definitely happen at the og uh love the breadsticks love the chicken scampi

59:51.920 --> 59:57.600
love so many of their offerings could not stand it after you know and not only while you're there

59:57.600 --> 01:00:03.440
the problem is especially with something like that pretzel smell it permeates eventually gets

01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:07.360
in you that's right it's it's gonna get in your clothes which will then get in your car which

01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:12.240
will then like you take you change you'll have your uniform at home and like your home will

01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:17.840
smell faintly of pretzels it will haunt you my friend tommy red used to work at fazoles

01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:24.640
and if he stored his uniform in the cab of his truck when he would give me a ride to school i

01:00:24.640 --> 01:00:31.680
would insist on riding in the truck bed so so vibrant was the smell of this fazoles uniform

01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:37.280
this this bizarro uh anti-air freshener um it's gonna make you hate if you work at a

01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:41.840
food you love you're gonna hate it a few weeks in if you work at a place you hate you're gonna

01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:48.000
hate it more so food service is incorrect i'm gonna give you my hot take and you got you all

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:53.680
can you've had approximately 400 jobs so i'll i will defer to you this is not one i've had

01:00:53.680 --> 01:01:00.320
but it is i'm pretty sure of what the the best job would be and that is the vape shop at the mall

01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:06.960
so vape shop is fucking cool because you just sit around and vape and if you're and your boss

01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:11.600
opens the door and they're like what are you doing just sitting around and vaping you'd be like uh

01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:16.720
yeah i am i'm both advertising our product and becoming more knowledgeable about it and i'm

01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:22.880
sitting here cranking some major fucking cotton yeah and spooking the the the guy over at macy's

01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:31.760
uh uh uh i think that the vape shop would be a very chill place to work morally i don't know the

01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:36.560
science is out yes when you're loved but that's it that's the perfect fix is when your loved ones

01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:41.840
are like uh the science is out but what science we have you know it's it's i'm i'm worried about

01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:52.800
you you can be like hey it's for work they actually made a rule at the vape shop at the

01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:58.960
honeyton mall at first they were allowed to crank cotton 24 sev and then they made a rule that you

01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:06.000
couldn't crank cotton at all and to watch the the discrepancy in employee satisfaction was

01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:12.560
so palpable it could be felt at the american cookie factory it was so so distinct did this

01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:18.800
go from like wow this is a fucking very good job to i've got to get the fuck out of here and indulge

01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:26.640
my addiction to aerosolized nicotine um boy between the bitcoin and vape chat this episode
