00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:46.800
Hello everybody and welcome to My Brother My Brother being the advice show for the

00:46.800 --> 00:51.360
modern era. I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother Travis McElroy.

00:51.360 --> 00:56.640
I'm that sweet baby brother Griffin McElroy. Just want to do a quick review. First off,

00:56.640 --> 01:02.240
congratulations to our friend, the person we I feel like we inspire every day,

01:02.960 --> 01:07.600
Lin-Manuel Miranda. He was on Saturday Night Live, and I was just thinking we could talk about some

01:07.600 --> 01:15.440
of the best. I mean, here's the thing. He's a he's a he's a friend and an inspiree by us,

01:15.440 --> 01:21.600
and so there's I feel like but if we're going to like you, I would say if we're if we're reviewing

01:21.600 --> 01:27.280
the product, I'm I've got to be impartial. I've got to be ethical about it. It should be easy

01:27.280 --> 01:33.440
to be impartial because we are recording this Saturday afternoon long before the episode is

01:33.440 --> 01:39.120
aired, so I feel like that will make it really easy to be impartial, to remain impartial as far

01:39.120 --> 01:45.520
as judging the episode goes. I feel like we don't go into his house and write musicals.

01:45.520 --> 01:51.200
You know what I mean? But he's coming into goof tavern. He's drinking our goof ale. He's

01:51.200 --> 01:55.440
maybe eating up all the goof pretzels on the counter, leaving none for anyone else.

01:56.240 --> 02:01.200
What were some of your guys' favorite sketches that Lin did? Because I got to tell you,

02:01.840 --> 02:09.200
when he brought back that classic Chris Kattan character, Mango, and it was like I could not

02:09.200 --> 02:14.400
believe he dropped Mango on us. He did that. He did Wayne's World. I thought Mango was actually

02:14.400 --> 02:20.000
as a tribute to me. I was really touched. In fact, I wept a little bit. What I didn't like

02:20.000 --> 02:26.480
very much is how they had Chris Kattan in old age makeup, and he came back as like an elderly Mango,

02:26.480 --> 02:30.720
and Lin was like new Mango. I really didn't understand why that was necessary.

02:30.720 --> 02:34.080
Justin, I don't want to disillusion you. We haven't seen Chris Kattan in a while.

02:34.080 --> 02:35.600
I'm not certain that was makeup.

02:36.640 --> 02:43.760
I didn't like the part where old Mango and Lin as young Mango fought each other,

02:43.760 --> 02:51.520
but because what got weird is that it seemed like it was not scripted to be like that,

02:51.520 --> 02:54.720
and it was just like our friend Lin Manuel Miranda was having a very real,

02:54.720 --> 03:00.080
very live fight with Chris Kattan on the stage with real punches and blows, and I was like,

03:00.080 --> 03:02.080
is this supposed to be happening right now?

03:02.720 --> 03:04.400
Are we supposed to be watching this?

03:04.400 --> 03:06.880
Because there was a point where Chris Kattan was just screaming,

03:06.880 --> 03:13.920
how could you do this to me, Lin? This was mine. This was my baby. You took this from me, Lin.

03:13.920 --> 03:16.240
I do Mango, he said, over and over again.

03:16.240 --> 03:18.240
He just kept screaming, I do Mango.

03:18.240 --> 03:23.040
I am Mango. Let me pivot just real quick. I got to bring it up. Coneheads.

03:23.040 --> 03:24.800
Oh boy, that's great.

03:24.800 --> 03:26.000
Did not see that coming.

03:26.000 --> 03:31.040
And the fact that they combined the Coneheads with the Spartan Cheerleaders, which honestly-

03:31.040 --> 03:32.080
Was a strange one.

03:32.080 --> 03:34.640
Brilliant. I thought it was brilliant. I get it. I get what they're-

03:34.640 --> 03:39.840
I think it's about the current political climate was kind of what they were satirizing there,

03:39.840 --> 03:41.280
and I thought it was great.

03:41.280 --> 03:45.840
I didn't understand why he came out as Cube Boy during the Conehead set.

03:46.400 --> 03:49.520
And again, it was one of those things where all of the actors on stage just stopped,

03:49.520 --> 03:51.120
and they're like, Lin, what are you doing?

03:51.680 --> 03:53.840
Why are you trying to create this new character Cube Boy?

03:53.840 --> 03:56.000
This is not how we did it in dress rehearsals.

03:56.000 --> 03:59.760
And Lin's thing was definitely funnier, but it was just, again, just kind of a weird energy.

03:59.760 --> 04:05.120
One thing that was weird to me was also that he brought Fire Marshall Bill back.

04:05.120 --> 04:09.120
That's a Mad TV character that James K did.

04:09.120 --> 04:12.960
And I don't even know why he would be Fire Marshall. He called it Bob.

04:12.960 --> 04:16.480
And I don't know if he forgot what he was originally called or what,

04:16.480 --> 04:19.360
but he did the whole, let me try to get something, that whole thing.

04:20.080 --> 04:20.800
He did that character.

04:20.800 --> 04:24.960
You know what, Justin, now that you mention it, I also thought it was weird

04:24.960 --> 04:30.480
when he came on as Baggins, Sagan, Barry, Keenan Thompson's character from All That.

04:30.480 --> 04:31.440
That was really weird.

04:32.240 --> 04:37.600
Why did he make Keenan stand outside a window on the set and watch the whole scene?

04:37.600 --> 04:38.880
That was so strange.

04:38.880 --> 04:43.120
I thought it was weird when they just sort of stopped

04:43.120 --> 04:47.440
and then Lin did a scene word for word from Martin

04:47.440 --> 04:50.720
where he played every role in the TV show Martin.

04:50.720 --> 04:51.760
I remember that.

04:51.760 --> 04:54.160
I remember.

04:54.160 --> 04:55.840
Is this even Saturday Night Live anymore?

04:56.560 --> 04:57.840
It was like a multimedia experience.

04:57.840 --> 05:00.800
And don't get me wrong, I loved it, A+, yes, absolutely, it was amazing.

05:00.800 --> 05:04.400
But it was like, it doesn't seem like he told anybody he was going to do it.

05:04.400 --> 05:08.720
Remember how they got the motorized armchair from the DAB from Roundhouse

05:08.720 --> 05:12.000
and Lin drove it around on stage for 20 minutes in silence?

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
And he just kept saying, look at me.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.040
Don't look away.

05:15.040 --> 05:16.000
Just watch it.

05:16.000 --> 05:20.560
I do think he brought it home when he brought out the record player

05:20.560 --> 05:22.480
and he lip-synced to Mighty Mouse,

05:23.040 --> 05:26.400
but he just did the part, here I come to save the day.

05:27.600 --> 05:32.160
That was so unique and new and no one's ever done anything like that before.

05:32.160 --> 05:33.680
It was a really good episode, though.

05:33.680 --> 05:34.800
It was so good.

05:34.800 --> 05:35.760
You know who was great?

05:35.760 --> 05:40.160
You know who I really liked was 25 pilots?

05:40.160 --> 05:41.600
No, they lost four.

05:41.600 --> 05:43.200
They lost four, they're down to 21.

05:44.080 --> 05:44.880
Damn.

05:44.880 --> 05:46.000
I know, it's a real shame.

05:46.560 --> 05:49.760
But you know, in this economy, you just can't afford all those pilots.

05:49.760 --> 05:54.000
Back in my day, you could smoke on a plane while 21 pilots had to watch you.

05:54.000 --> 05:54.960
And what are they doing?

05:54.960 --> 05:56.720
There were 21 joysticks on the plane.

05:56.720 --> 05:57.840
What are you doing?

05:57.840 --> 06:00.560
You could get 25 pilots for a nickel.

06:00.560 --> 06:00.880
Yeah.

06:01.680 --> 06:03.200
And movies were better.

06:03.200 --> 06:05.120
This is an advice show, really.

06:06.560 --> 06:07.840
If you think about it.

06:07.840 --> 06:09.760
If you think about it, this is an advice show.

06:09.760 --> 06:11.840
We don't need to advise Lin.

06:11.840 --> 06:16.240
He already just like crushed it on Snull.

06:16.240 --> 06:18.960
So I'm ready to just do our thing now.

06:18.960 --> 06:19.760
Yeah, let's get wild.

06:19.760 --> 06:20.240
Let's do it.

06:20.240 --> 06:22.560
Let's really get back in our wheelhouse.

06:23.280 --> 06:24.080
We're back.

06:24.080 --> 06:26.400
I love my big brother to death.

06:26.400 --> 06:26.880
Oh, no.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.120
That was a weird accent.

06:29.120 --> 06:30.080
I shouldn't have done that.

06:30.080 --> 06:30.320
Yeah.

06:30.320 --> 06:32.160
I love my big brother to death.

06:32.160 --> 06:35.360
We're very good friends and often go to social gatherings together.

06:35.360 --> 06:38.160
He's probably the nicest guy I know, which is generally a good thing,

06:38.160 --> 06:40.400
but has some unfortunate side effects.

06:40.400 --> 06:44.160
He sometimes takes up to 30 to 40 minutes to leave a place

06:44.160 --> 06:49.280
because he has to say individual and personalized goodbyes to everyone,

06:49.280 --> 06:53.520
which leaves me waiting by the door awkwardly more times than I'd like to admit.

06:53.520 --> 06:56.160
Although I know it comes from a very good place.

06:56.160 --> 06:57.840
I'm pretty irritated by this.

06:57.840 --> 06:58.560
Am I good?

06:59.280 --> 07:00.560
Should I say something?

07:00.560 --> 07:03.200
If I do, how do I do it without hurting his feelings?

07:03.200 --> 07:05.760
That's from Tardy and Tired in Tel Aviv.

07:05.760 --> 07:06.960
Oh, that's a really good one.

07:08.640 --> 07:09.840
This is you shouldn't.

07:10.880 --> 07:12.160
You can't change your brother.

07:12.160 --> 07:15.280
You can change your travel arrangements to things.

07:16.320 --> 07:19.200
I think that's what you got to do because I love this person.

07:19.200 --> 07:21.040
It makes you feel so special.

07:21.040 --> 07:21.520
Oh, sure.

07:23.920 --> 07:27.360
When I take off, my move is I thank whoever hosted the party

07:28.000 --> 07:30.880
and anybody I see on my way to the door and then I turn and I say,

07:30.880 --> 07:32.560
bye everybody, see you later.

07:32.560 --> 07:37.840
I walk out and do a quick little shout cast and then I scoot my way on out

07:37.840 --> 07:40.320
because I also don't want to take 40 minutes to leave.

07:40.320 --> 07:42.640
See my move, I just bounce like a gummy bear.

07:42.640 --> 07:46.560
I just sit there and I think like, I'm done and I walk out the door.

07:46.560 --> 07:49.280
Well, that's oftentimes that's just how impulsive I am.

07:49.280 --> 07:50.960
That's the energy I bring to a party.

07:51.600 --> 07:54.080
I'm sitting there having a great time and mid sentence,

07:54.080 --> 07:56.320
it just clicks on my head like my time here is done

07:56.320 --> 07:58.160
and I just walk out the front door.

07:58.160 --> 07:59.440
Yeah, it's very random.

07:59.440 --> 08:02.400
Sometimes I'll be talking to you and you'll just start screaming

08:02.400 --> 08:04.720
and trying to kick me and it's like, what?

08:04.720 --> 08:06.800
And it's like, I love that random energy that Travis brings.

08:06.800 --> 08:09.040
And then I'm running out the door

08:09.040 --> 08:10.880
and I'm going to the next adventure.

08:10.880 --> 08:14.480
I really liked at my wedding when you just weren't there anymore.

08:14.480 --> 08:16.880
And it was like, well, how random, how funny?

08:16.880 --> 08:18.880
What would you guys think if he,

08:18.880 --> 08:23.760
if you just showed up 30 to 40 minutes later than your brother?

08:24.320 --> 08:27.760
So what I'm suggesting here is if you show up later,

08:28.640 --> 08:33.840
then you'll be ready to go at the exact moment that he is.

08:33.840 --> 08:35.040
You know what I mean?

08:35.040 --> 08:38.080
Maybe he's like, I love my brother,

08:38.080 --> 08:41.280
but he always shows up 30 to 40 minutes too early

08:41.280 --> 08:42.640
to every social gathering.

08:42.640 --> 08:45.840
Like I'm saying, if you came later, maybe it would balance out.

08:45.840 --> 08:47.120
You'd be on the same schedule.

08:47.120 --> 08:48.960
Or you could just like look at your brother and say,

08:48.960 --> 08:51.920
hey, in 30 or 40 minutes, I'm going to be ready to leave.

08:51.920 --> 08:53.120
So start doing the goodbyes.

08:53.120 --> 08:57.200
Now, I will also say that I appreciate your concern,

08:57.200 --> 08:59.200
but I doubt very much that if you said,

08:59.200 --> 09:01.680
I doubt your brother is unaware of the fact

09:01.680 --> 09:04.240
that you were often waiting by the door

09:04.240 --> 09:06.000
as he says his goodbyes.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.440
Like, I think that's probably something,

09:07.440 --> 09:09.280
if this has happened more than twice,

09:09.280 --> 09:10.960
he's probably picked up on the fact,

09:10.960 --> 09:13.600
but he just sees it as like, I love my brother,

09:13.600 --> 09:16.400
but why is he so rude and doesn't say goodbye to anybody?

09:16.400 --> 09:19.200
That's the real stitch, isn't it?

09:19.200 --> 09:22.400
Is that your brother's doing these beautiful goodbyes,

09:22.400 --> 09:24.720
never leaves a party without putting some tears

09:24.720 --> 09:25.840
in those eyeballs.

09:25.840 --> 09:28.560
Yeah, and you aren't doing that

09:28.560 --> 09:30.400
unless you are just sort of catching his,

09:30.400 --> 09:33.520
unless you're drafting, as they say in racing terminology,

09:34.240 --> 09:35.520
you're probably not doing that.

09:35.520 --> 09:37.440
So you just sit there and wait for your brother to say

09:37.440 --> 09:38.960
all the goodbyes and then you probably do what I do,

09:38.960 --> 09:40.320
which is the shout blast.

09:41.520 --> 09:43.120
And then you seem probably like a dick

09:43.120 --> 09:45.040
and so like, I know Derek so well.

09:45.040 --> 09:48.000
His brother, Jason, I don't know him from Adam,

09:48.000 --> 09:48.880
his other brother.

09:50.240 --> 09:51.520
Who's also very friendly.

09:51.520 --> 09:52.800
Who's also extremely friendly.

09:52.800 --> 09:55.120
It's just, fuck Jason, really.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.680
So I'm saying like, let your brother know

09:57.680 --> 10:00.000
because maybe you can meet in the middle somewhere

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
and arrange it more of like,

10:02.000 --> 10:05.520
hey, I'm gonna be ready to go in like an hour.

10:05.520 --> 10:08.000
Let's start making our way to the door,

10:08.000 --> 10:08.880
that kind of thing,

10:08.880 --> 10:11.360
rather than you just like standing by the door

10:11.360 --> 10:13.520
and you know, because here's the thing,

10:13.520 --> 10:15.120
especially if this is a recurring thing,

10:15.120 --> 10:16.720
no matter how hard you try to hide it,

10:16.720 --> 10:18.960
you're probably reading as impatient.

10:19.760 --> 10:21.040
And so like-

10:21.040 --> 10:23.520
And also let me clarify something.

10:23.520 --> 10:25.920
I've been a brother for almost 33 years now.

10:26.640 --> 10:28.000
He is trolling you.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.960
Like 100%, if he sees you standing by the door,

10:30.960 --> 10:33.120
he is going to make those goodbyes last

10:33.120 --> 10:34.880
as long as humanly possible.

10:34.880 --> 10:36.800
100% guaranteed.

10:36.800 --> 10:37.600
Bye, Dave.

10:37.600 --> 10:38.560
Wait, you know what, Dave?

10:38.560 --> 10:41.200
Before I go, remind me, how did we meet?

10:41.200 --> 10:43.440
What's the etymology of the name Dave?

10:45.360 --> 10:48.640
Hey, Dave, let's talk about some of our other famous Daves.

10:48.640 --> 10:50.720
What are some of your favorite Daves, Dave?

10:50.720 --> 10:54.160
Dave, will you for me recap in synopsis

10:54.160 --> 10:57.200
the entire plot of the television show Entourage?

10:57.200 --> 10:59.120
Everyone, everyone gather around.

10:59.120 --> 11:02.480
Dave is going to regale us with the plot-

11:02.480 --> 11:03.520
The plantarage.

11:03.520 --> 11:05.040
You know, the plot of Entourage.

11:06.880 --> 11:08.080
Sit down, Jason.

11:08.080 --> 11:09.360
Listen to Dave.

11:09.360 --> 11:11.280
Dave, what's your favorite epic poem?

11:12.960 --> 11:15.040
Remember the other day when you were recounting

11:15.040 --> 11:16.640
Gilgamesh for me, Dave?

11:16.640 --> 11:17.600
Do it once more.

11:17.600 --> 11:20.560
Dave, sit with me and read all of the menu items

11:20.560 --> 11:23.520
and calorie counts for every item at Taco Bell.

11:24.720 --> 11:25.680
This is the problem.

11:25.680 --> 11:27.760
This is why we shouldn't have parties anymore.

11:27.760 --> 11:30.080
Parties made sense in agrarian societies

11:30.080 --> 11:32.320
because at some point everybody would be like,

11:32.320 --> 11:34.640
fuck, I gotta wake up early to farm.

11:34.640 --> 11:35.920
I can't be here anymore.

11:35.920 --> 11:37.280
Everybody agree on the time-

11:38.160 --> 11:39.760
The first time there was an invitation printed

11:39.760 --> 11:42.080
with a question mark on it, we should have retired parties

11:42.080 --> 11:44.640
because we need agrarian responsibilities

11:44.640 --> 11:46.320
to be able to get us out of parties.

11:46.320 --> 11:48.560
Unless you have agrarian responsibilities,

11:48.560 --> 11:50.880
you are not going to be able to leave any party.

11:50.880 --> 11:54.480
This is actually why I super love being in my 30s now

11:54.480 --> 11:57.760
because I like, Teresa and I get so excited when a party starts

11:57.760 --> 12:01.440
at like 2 p.m. when it's like, ah, shit, yeah,

12:01.440 --> 12:05.360
it's in between lunch and dinner and it will be done by six.

12:05.360 --> 12:06.160
This is awesome.

12:07.040 --> 12:08.480
God, I don't know ever when I turn 30.

12:08.480 --> 12:10.080
I love it when it just gets lit.

12:10.080 --> 12:11.920
When it gets sun up, sun down.

12:11.920 --> 12:14.400
I'll raise a fucking bar for 16 hours.

12:14.400 --> 12:15.120
I don't give a shit.

12:18.320 --> 12:22.960
The amount of predicted discomfort required for me

12:22.960 --> 12:26.560
to insist that I drive separately to an event

12:26.560 --> 12:30.720
is so small, so minor, so insignificant.

12:30.720 --> 12:32.720
Ah, man, I really want to be home by 10.

12:32.720 --> 12:34.960
Oh, I was thinking about staying out till about 10.15.

12:34.960 --> 12:36.560
Ooh, sounds like we should drive separate then

12:36.560 --> 12:41.680
because let's drive and it's 100 miles

12:41.680 --> 12:43.680
and it'll take us two hours to get there,

12:44.480 --> 12:47.200
but I am going to stop at one gas station on the way.

12:47.200 --> 12:49.200
Ooh, I don't know about that.

12:49.200 --> 12:53.840
I should probably drive separate.

12:53.840 --> 12:55.200
Do you guys want to Yahoo?

12:55.200 --> 12:56.000
Yeah, sure.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.400
How about this one from Level 9000 YajurJurJur Davenport?

12:58.400 --> 12:58.880
Thank you, Drew.

12:58.880 --> 13:00.240
It's by Yajur Answers User.

13:01.520 --> 13:02.160
Question mark.

13:03.040 --> 13:03.600
Who asks?

13:04.960 --> 13:07.840
Why can't joggers run around in a circle?

13:08.480 --> 13:10.800
Why do they have to run where they can pose

13:10.800 --> 13:12.160
and flex in front of everyone?

13:13.600 --> 13:14.720
As an extremely-

13:14.720 --> 13:15.520
What?

13:15.520 --> 13:17.440
Why can't joggers run around in a circle?

13:17.440 --> 13:19.440
Why do they have to run where they can pose and flex

13:19.440 --> 13:20.480
in front of everyone?

13:20.480 --> 13:22.240
As an extremely lazy person,

13:22.240 --> 13:24.880
I would rather not see someone else getting fit.

13:24.880 --> 13:27.120
I really don't need any more guilt.

13:27.120 --> 13:28.000
Okay, wait, hold on.

13:31.360 --> 13:33.520
Why can't they just run in a small circle

13:33.520 --> 13:34.400
in their front yard?

13:36.160 --> 13:38.640
Travis McElroy, I'm an extremely lazy person.

13:38.640 --> 13:40.080
I rarely find joggers come-

13:40.080 --> 13:41.680
As evidenced by your pronunciation

13:41.680 --> 13:43.760
of every word in that sentence.

13:43.760 --> 13:46.240
I rarely find joggers coming to me.

13:46.240 --> 13:47.440
Yeah.

13:47.440 --> 13:50.000
Like, I rarely am forced to look at joggers

13:50.000 --> 13:51.680
from inside my home.

13:51.680 --> 13:54.880
So is this lazy person, like, going to the park

13:54.880 --> 13:55.600
and then they're like,

13:55.600 --> 13:57.440
what's the deal with all these joggers?

13:57.440 --> 13:59.280
I just came here to be lazy.

13:59.280 --> 14:00.240
I tell you what I hate, though,

14:00.240 --> 14:02.160
is when you do encounter one

14:02.720 --> 14:04.720
and then they stop and they turn towards you

14:05.760 --> 14:07.360
just glistening and they're just like,

14:07.360 --> 14:08.960
oh, yes, it's me.

14:09.520 --> 14:10.640
Can you believe it?

14:10.640 --> 14:11.600
It's me.

14:11.600 --> 14:12.100
Oh!

14:13.440 --> 14:14.800
Drink it in!

14:14.800 --> 14:16.320
Drink me up.

14:16.320 --> 14:16.880
It's me.

14:17.840 --> 14:18.560
Wonderful.

14:19.600 --> 14:21.440
How wonderful you've seen me.

14:23.520 --> 14:24.640
Remember this.

14:26.800 --> 14:28.800
Tell your grandchildren's children

14:28.800 --> 14:31.120
about the day that you met me.

14:31.120 --> 14:32.240
It's why I can't go to the gym.

14:32.240 --> 14:34.160
It's because it's too loud in there.

14:34.160 --> 14:35.360
Just everybody's just like,

14:35.360 --> 14:37.120
yes, it's me, yes.

14:38.320 --> 14:41.920
How long would you be able to run in a circle

14:41.920 --> 14:43.200
in your front yard

14:43.200 --> 14:46.080
and not get arrested?

14:46.080 --> 14:46.580
Yes.

14:46.580 --> 14:49.520
Because I feel like if you did it for more than 15 minutes,

14:49.520 --> 14:50.720
the police would come and say,

14:50.720 --> 14:51.920
I don't know why,

14:51.920 --> 14:54.240
but we're pretty sure we have to arrest you.

14:54.240 --> 14:55.840
This is untenable.

14:55.840 --> 14:59.360
If I ran around in a circle for 15 seconds in my front yard,

14:59.360 --> 15:02.240
the police would have to arrest me for projectile vomiting.

15:02.240 --> 15:02.740
Yeah.

15:04.400 --> 15:06.320
Sir, we're arresting you for attempted suicide.

15:06.320 --> 15:06.820
Thank you.

15:06.820 --> 15:07.840
Save me from myself.

15:07.840 --> 15:08.340
Blah!

15:08.340 --> 15:08.840
Blah!

15:10.800 --> 15:11.300
This is...

15:11.300 --> 15:15.540
This is good fitness though, right?

15:16.100 --> 15:17.380
Just do it in a circle.

15:17.380 --> 15:18.180
Why not?

15:18.180 --> 15:19.700
Because it would get too tiring.

15:19.700 --> 15:21.700
Yeah, dog, exercise.

15:21.700 --> 15:24.020
Well, the real worry is that what ends up happening

15:24.020 --> 15:26.660
is just like in DuckTales,

15:26.660 --> 15:28.420
if you go in a circle too many times,

15:28.420 --> 15:30.660
you're gonna wear a circle into the ground.

15:31.460 --> 15:32.580
What are you talking about?

15:32.580 --> 15:34.420
What the fuck are you talking about?

15:34.420 --> 15:35.620
That makes perfect sense.

15:35.620 --> 15:37.460
If you run in a circle for a long...

15:37.460 --> 15:38.500
Think about it, Griffin.

15:38.500 --> 15:40.180
Really think for once.

15:40.180 --> 15:43.220
If you run in a circle in your yard for a very long time,

15:43.220 --> 15:45.220
eventually you're going to start to dig a ditch,

15:45.940 --> 15:47.620
a circle-shaped ditch.

15:47.620 --> 15:48.980
First, the grass will die.

15:48.980 --> 15:49.860
Very embarrassing.

15:49.860 --> 15:51.140
Crop circles in my yard?

15:51.140 --> 15:52.260
No, thank you.

15:52.260 --> 15:53.540
And then after the grass is dead,

15:53.540 --> 15:55.140
you're just gonna start digging down in the dirt,

15:55.140 --> 15:57.300
and eventually you'll have a very ugly,

15:57.300 --> 16:00.420
irredeemable circle from jogging in your yard.

16:00.420 --> 16:00.920
Exactly.

16:01.940 --> 16:02.820
I'm sorry, guys.

16:02.820 --> 16:05.540
On this Yahoo page, there's an ad that says,

16:05.540 --> 16:08.340
Melissa McCarthy says her goodbyes at 45.

16:08.340 --> 16:10.340
No, it's not.

16:10.340 --> 16:11.300
She didn't.

16:11.300 --> 16:13.700
Why are you an ad on Yahoo Answers right now?

16:15.140 --> 16:16.180
Why would she say her goodbyes?

16:16.180 --> 16:18.180
I clicked through, and it's E Online.

16:18.180 --> 16:19.380
Hey, E Online.

16:19.380 --> 16:20.180
Why are you...

16:20.180 --> 16:20.680
Why?

16:22.660 --> 16:22.900
Okay.

16:22.900 --> 16:24.420
Does it mean something different?

16:24.420 --> 16:24.820
I saw it.

16:24.820 --> 16:25.780
We were having a good time recording this podcast.

16:25.780 --> 16:28.900
She was leaving a party, and it took a long time.

16:28.900 --> 16:30.260
We're having a good time recording this podcast,

16:30.260 --> 16:32.580
and my eyes dart to the right on the Yahoo Answers page.

16:32.580 --> 16:34.100
It's like, yo, Melissa McCarthy died.

16:34.100 --> 16:34.980
It's like, what?

16:34.980 --> 16:35.620
Click it.

16:35.620 --> 16:36.100
Just kidding.

16:36.100 --> 16:37.220
Thanks for reading E Online.

16:37.220 --> 16:38.340
This is an advertisement.

16:39.060 --> 16:39.860
Stupid.

16:39.860 --> 16:40.900
She's fine.

16:40.900 --> 16:41.460
She's fine.

16:41.460 --> 16:42.660
Is Melissa McCarthy okay?

16:42.660 --> 16:43.380
No, she's good.

16:44.180 --> 16:46.420
I haven't told anybody this story.

16:46.420 --> 16:47.940
I've certainly never said it on the air,

16:47.940 --> 16:49.620
because what if she listens?

16:49.620 --> 16:50.340
And I don't know.

16:50.340 --> 16:51.780
This story is not about Melissa McCarthy.

16:51.780 --> 16:52.580
I know it sounds...

16:52.580 --> 16:53.700
Sorry, bad transition.

16:53.700 --> 16:55.780
But one day, Rachel and I were at home.

16:55.780 --> 16:56.500
We were having dinner.

16:56.500 --> 16:58.260
We're watching Walking Dead, I think.

16:58.260 --> 17:00.180
And we get a knock at the door,

17:00.180 --> 17:02.420
and it was a woman who was out for a run,

17:02.420 --> 17:05.460
and she looked really bad off,

17:05.460 --> 17:07.460
and she explained that she was very, very sick,

17:07.460 --> 17:08.900
and she had just gotten very, very sick

17:08.900 --> 17:09.700
while she was out on the road,

17:09.700 --> 17:11.220
and she asked if she could use our bathroom.

17:12.100 --> 17:16.900
And in like the kindest act maybe we've ever done,

17:16.900 --> 17:18.740
we said, yeah, okay, go fuck it up.

17:18.740 --> 17:22.260
Just like, I know it's gonna get really, really wild in there,

17:22.260 --> 17:23.620
and please do that,

17:23.620 --> 17:26.260
because the alternative is really, I guess, horrible.

17:26.260 --> 17:28.580
We can't let that happen to a fellow human being.

17:29.940 --> 17:31.460
And then we had to drive her home,

17:31.460 --> 17:32.740
because she was very, very sick after that.

17:32.740 --> 17:34.740
And that is like, that, guys,

17:34.740 --> 17:36.660
that's why I don't want to go out jogging.

17:36.660 --> 17:38.260
I'll jog in a circle in my front yard,

17:38.260 --> 17:40.180
because then if I get hit,

17:40.180 --> 17:43.060
and my dookie box just gets really, really crazy,

17:43.060 --> 17:46.260
then I have like, I know exactly where to go.

17:46.260 --> 17:47.620
What if I get lost out there,

17:48.180 --> 17:49.540
and it gets wild in my dookie box,

17:49.540 --> 17:50.340
because I, I don't know,

17:51.060 --> 17:53.940
ate a weird salad yesterday or something.

17:53.940 --> 17:57.780
See, this is why there should be on like people's front porches,

17:57.780 --> 17:59.060
like on columns or something,

17:59.060 --> 18:01.140
some kind of marking to let you know

18:01.140 --> 18:03.540
that that's a safe house to use the bathroom at

18:03.540 --> 18:05.700
if you're out jogging and you have an emergency.

18:06.660 --> 18:09.380
Jogger is welcome to wreck our shop, come on in.

18:09.380 --> 18:11.300
Also like, they'll give you a plate of biscuits

18:11.300 --> 18:13.060
for painting the fence, that kind of thing.

18:13.060 --> 18:15.460
I do want to say, it was not that bad.

18:16.900 --> 18:19.940
I could, I'm glad it wasn't that bad.

18:19.940 --> 18:25.220
I will admit to, I started jogging a couple months ago,

18:25.220 --> 18:27.060
and, but I've mainly just been jogging

18:27.060 --> 18:28.100
in the neighborhood around my house.

18:28.740 --> 18:30.660
And I started doing it at the park,

18:30.660 --> 18:31.780
just for a change of scenery.

18:31.780 --> 18:33.860
And this is very embarrassing.

18:33.860 --> 18:37.060
I had a moment when I was basically halfway

18:37.060 --> 18:39.220
around the track from my car,

18:39.860 --> 18:42.180
and I had this little bit of panic where I thought,

18:42.180 --> 18:45.060
if I get tired of running,

18:46.180 --> 18:50.180
I don't have a way back to my car other than that.

18:50.740 --> 18:54.420
Like the decision to stop perambulating

18:54.420 --> 18:56.020
has been robbed from me,

18:56.020 --> 19:00.420
because I will have to do that to get back to my car.

19:00.420 --> 19:01.140
You know what I mean?

19:01.140 --> 19:03.700
I know exactly what you mean, Justin.

19:03.700 --> 19:04.980
When I still lived in Los Angeles,

19:04.980 --> 19:06.820
I went down to Venice Beach,

19:06.820 --> 19:09.860
and I walked the dog along the Venice Beach boardwalk,

19:09.860 --> 19:13.140
and I walked for a mile, and I was very proud of myself.

19:13.140 --> 19:15.620
And then I realized that my car was still back

19:15.620 --> 19:17.940
at the other end of that mile.

19:17.940 --> 19:20.020
And I was so defeated in that moment

19:20.020 --> 19:22.020
that I thought about calling a Lyft

19:22.020 --> 19:23.540
to take me back to my car.

19:25.860 --> 19:27.780
You don't psychically prepare for that.

19:27.780 --> 19:29.220
Like you gotta be ready.

19:29.220 --> 19:30.900
I'm in desperate need of some advice.

19:30.900 --> 19:34.500
I was helping Lyft a table at the office,

19:34.500 --> 19:36.420
and I ripped a hole in my suit pants

19:36.420 --> 19:38.020
from zipper to top of belt.

19:39.460 --> 19:40.260
Wait, what?

19:41.460 --> 19:43.540
From zipper to top of belt?

19:45.060 --> 19:46.980
Oh, probably from the bottom of zipper.

19:46.980 --> 19:49.220
Bottom of zipper to top of belt on the back.

19:49.220 --> 19:50.660
Oh my God.

19:50.660 --> 19:51.940
That's quite a rip.

19:51.940 --> 19:54.820
I've been sitting here for some time at my desk.

19:56.260 --> 19:58.180
What are my next steps, brothers?

19:58.180 --> 20:00.820
And that's from assless slacks.

20:00.820 --> 20:02.740
This probably came in a few days ago, right?

20:02.740 --> 20:05.220
So like, it has been some time.

20:06.340 --> 20:08.500
I hope they got someone bringing in water and stuff.

20:08.500 --> 20:11.380
I mean, it's a real 127 hour situation.

20:12.820 --> 20:14.180
In the short term,

20:14.180 --> 20:16.580
you're gonna have to be the last one in the office.

20:16.580 --> 20:17.400
Yes.

20:17.400 --> 20:18.820
Like people are gonna have to look at you

20:18.820 --> 20:20.420
and be like, hey, oh, we're,

20:20.420 --> 20:22.180
and you're like, yeah, just try to figure out,

20:22.180 --> 20:24.260
finish up the big Robertson report.

20:24.260 --> 20:26.500
Just, hey, working hard or hardly working?

20:26.500 --> 20:29.380
Bill, Bill, please.

20:29.380 --> 20:30.660
Please go.

20:30.660 --> 20:32.340
Please just go, Bill.

20:32.340 --> 20:33.780
I'm having kind of a late one too.

20:33.780 --> 20:34.820
Got a big project.

20:34.820 --> 20:36.900
Thought I might stay here all weekend.

20:36.900 --> 20:39.700
Bill, Bill, please, God, please.

20:41.300 --> 20:43.140
I'm begging you just this once, Bill.

20:43.140 --> 20:44.020
You know what?

20:44.020 --> 20:45.220
Let's make this an all nighter.

20:45.220 --> 20:46.340
Just you and I, huh?

20:46.340 --> 20:47.940
We'll work on projects together.

20:47.940 --> 20:49.460
Maybe order some pizzas,

20:49.460 --> 20:51.380
crack open some beers after everyone's gone.

20:51.380 --> 20:52.020
How's it sound?

20:52.020 --> 20:52.900
You know how you've been talking about

20:52.900 --> 20:54.820
how you want to start playing D&D?

20:54.820 --> 20:56.260
Well, let's do it.

20:56.260 --> 20:57.780
I've got some D20s.

20:57.780 --> 20:58.420
Let's go.

20:58.420 --> 21:00.900
First off, stand, first off, stand up for me.

21:01.940 --> 21:02.820
Bill, what?

21:02.820 --> 21:04.740
Stand up for me right now in front of everyone.

21:05.860 --> 21:07.700
Bill, no, I don't, I don't want to.

21:07.700 --> 21:08.820
Take a bow.

21:08.820 --> 21:11.380
No, no, Bill, please don't make me do this.

21:12.500 --> 21:14.020
I'm calling in my favor.

21:14.020 --> 21:15.940
Do me a favor and just to stand up

21:15.940 --> 21:17.140
and spread your butt cheeks out.

21:17.140 --> 21:18.900
Bill, no, it shouldn't be a problem

21:18.900 --> 21:20.260
if your pants are good.

21:21.380 --> 21:22.020
Bill, how?

21:24.020 --> 21:24.820
Bill, why?

21:24.820 --> 21:25.380
Bill, why?

21:25.380 --> 21:26.260
Part the cheeks.

21:26.260 --> 21:26.760
Bill.

21:28.420 --> 21:29.620
Hey, do you remember that one time

21:29.620 --> 21:30.580
that you ate my sandwich?

21:30.580 --> 21:31.620
I don't know what you're talking about, Bill.

21:31.620 --> 21:33.220
I think you know exactly what I'm talking about.

21:33.220 --> 21:34.020
Stand up.

21:34.020 --> 21:34.660
Let's see that cheek.

21:34.660 --> 21:35.140
Stand up.

21:36.900 --> 21:38.100
Hey guys, check this out.

21:38.100 --> 21:38.420
Okay.

21:38.420 --> 21:39.700
Bomb threat.

21:39.700 --> 21:41.300
No, don't, no, no, no, no, no.

21:41.300 --> 21:42.900
That's, that's an FBI crime.

21:42.900 --> 21:43.460
The big one.

21:44.100 --> 21:45.220
Okay, that's not gonna work.

21:46.100 --> 21:48.980
First of all, staples I think can do this.

21:49.540 --> 21:50.980
Oh, but you're gonna have to be so careful.

21:50.980 --> 21:52.420
You have to take the pants off first.

21:52.420 --> 21:54.100
So wait, you take your pants to staples

21:54.100 --> 21:55.460
and then what, just say like,

21:55.460 --> 21:56.580
hey listen, I need new pants.

21:56.580 --> 21:58.740
Listen, staples is the number one office solution.

21:58.740 --> 21:59.940
I think if you go in the door

21:59.940 --> 22:00.500
and your asshole's showing-

22:00.500 --> 22:02.580
This is an office and you need a solution.

22:02.580 --> 22:04.420
Right, your asshole's showing in the office.

22:04.420 --> 22:06.420
You're like, yo dog, this is,

22:06.420 --> 22:09.060
now this is, now it's in your court.

22:09.060 --> 22:09.940
Fix this.

22:09.940 --> 22:11.220
We've got another one.

22:11.220 --> 22:13.780
Debbie, get the emergency kit.

22:14.980 --> 22:16.100
I'm just saying that staples

22:16.100 --> 22:17.700
probably takes care of this all the time.

22:17.700 --> 22:17.940
Yes.

22:17.940 --> 22:18.900
Call Papa John's.

22:19.460 --> 22:21.060
Call Papa John's and say,

22:21.060 --> 22:23.220
I need a hot and fresh pizza delivery

22:23.220 --> 22:24.580
and media mente.

22:24.580 --> 22:26.660
And then as soon as the pizza gets there,

22:27.220 --> 22:28.660
they stretch it out on the table,

22:28.660 --> 22:29.940
the one pizza table,

22:29.940 --> 22:31.380
and they put out all the pizza

22:31.380 --> 22:33.620
and everybody's like, oh, grub time.

22:33.620 --> 22:35.460
When everybody gets up to grub,

22:35.460 --> 22:36.660
you make your exit.

22:37.220 --> 22:39.860
Hello, perfect plan.

22:39.860 --> 22:41.620
Except for one thing, Justin.

22:41.620 --> 22:42.580
There's no flaws.

22:42.580 --> 22:43.700
There's no flaws.

22:43.700 --> 22:45.540
Travis, whatever you say is gonna be a fucking lie.

22:45.540 --> 22:46.420
So, but go ahead.

22:46.980 --> 22:47.940
Bill's on a diet.

22:49.300 --> 22:50.740
Dammit, that's actually foolproof.

22:50.740 --> 22:51.700
That's very good.

22:51.700 --> 22:52.500
Mm-hmm.

22:52.500 --> 22:54.180
Bill's getting that gluten free.

22:54.180 --> 22:55.540
He brought a salad from home.

22:55.540 --> 22:56.740
He ate it at 11 30

22:56.740 --> 22:57.540
because he got hungry.

22:58.900 --> 23:00.020
What if you just,

23:00.020 --> 23:03.380
hey, what if you just fucking own it?

23:03.380 --> 23:05.300
Yeah, welcome to the boss's office.

23:05.300 --> 23:06.660
Like, hey, I want to raise.

23:06.660 --> 23:08.020
And before you say anything,

23:08.020 --> 23:10.020
check out this, this hole.

23:13.460 --> 23:14.500
I want to raise.

23:14.500 --> 23:15.620
No butts about it.

23:16.180 --> 23:18.020
And then like, show them your butthole.

23:18.660 --> 23:20.260
Set your pants on fire.

23:20.260 --> 23:20.820
Listen.

23:20.820 --> 23:21.140
Yeah.

23:21.140 --> 23:21.940
If you do that,

23:23.940 --> 23:26.580
everybody will be like very moved by your plight

23:26.580 --> 23:28.580
and everybody will be very worried about you.

23:28.580 --> 23:32.020
You have to very quickly get the pant fire under control.

23:32.020 --> 23:33.460
And I'm seriously,

23:33.460 --> 23:35.860
you probably shouldn't even let it get out of control.

23:35.860 --> 23:37.620
It should be a very isolated,

23:37.620 --> 23:39.460
controlled burn of your pants.

23:40.020 --> 23:41.620
And in the side-

23:41.620 --> 23:43.140
That's good, Justin.

23:43.140 --> 23:45.300
That's good because then your pants will grow back

23:45.300 --> 23:46.820
stronger and lusher than ever.

23:46.820 --> 23:49.220
This is a fun little farce that you've put together.

23:49.220 --> 23:51.620
A fun little Family Matters-esque romp

23:51.620 --> 23:52.740
that you've built for us.

23:52.740 --> 23:54.660
Maybe get your pants stuck in the shredder.

23:56.500 --> 23:58.020
That's actually not bad.

23:58.020 --> 24:00.260
What I'm saying is if you set your pants on fire

24:00.260 --> 24:01.460
and then can get them out,

24:01.460 --> 24:04.180
no one's going to question next steps.

24:04.180 --> 24:05.700
I think you're going home.

24:05.700 --> 24:07.540
Like, you get the rest of the day off.

24:08.420 --> 24:09.540
You're going to have to figure out a way

24:09.540 --> 24:12.980
to get someone stodgier than you for their pants to rip.

24:14.180 --> 24:18.340
Just be grateful that it ripped the way it did.

24:18.340 --> 24:22.740
And you didn't get the Kravitz gap.

24:22.740 --> 24:24.260
You didn't get a full-blown Kravitz.

24:24.260 --> 24:26.020
You didn't get a full-blown

24:27.700 --> 24:30.500
Lenny Kravitz fault line situation.

24:31.460 --> 24:32.420
Do you guys want to Yahoo?

24:32.420 --> 24:32.900
Another one?

24:33.780 --> 24:34.580
Sure, yeah.

24:34.580 --> 24:36.100
This one was sent in by Aaron Keese.

24:37.140 --> 24:37.640
The-

24:38.820 --> 24:39.460
Keese Blade.

24:40.660 --> 24:41.780
Nope, you've tried that one before.

24:41.780 --> 24:43.060
Oh, I have.

24:43.060 --> 24:44.100
Here are the keys to the kingdom.

24:44.820 --> 24:46.420
The keys to the city.

24:46.420 --> 24:47.060
Here's the keys.

24:47.060 --> 24:48.260
Thank you, Aaron.

24:48.260 --> 24:50.740
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Wesley, who asks,

24:51.780 --> 24:55.940
how to make your parents think you found a lizard

24:55.940 --> 24:57.780
even though you bought it online.

25:04.100 --> 25:04.660
There's so many-

25:06.020 --> 25:07.380
There's a lot of answers here,

25:07.380 --> 25:08.900
and I'd like to just read a couple

25:08.900 --> 25:10.260
just to like sort of set the tone

25:10.980 --> 25:13.540
because the top answer is there's no point in lying.

25:13.540 --> 25:14.500
Just tell them the truth.

25:14.500 --> 25:17.140
Otherwise, the consequences will be much worse.

25:17.140 --> 25:19.380
At worst, if you manage to tell them

25:19.380 --> 25:20.580
it's a lizard you found outside

25:20.580 --> 25:21.860
and they didn't want a lizard in the house,

25:21.860 --> 25:22.820
they'll make you release it.

25:22.820 --> 25:23.860
That's not a bad point.

25:24.660 --> 25:25.700
I think you could just say,

25:25.700 --> 25:28.260
I bought this lizard, so it lives here now.

25:28.900 --> 25:29.780
They can't just be like,

25:29.780 --> 25:32.580
well, no, put it outside where it doesn't belong.

25:32.580 --> 25:33.780
Yeah, where are these parents

25:33.780 --> 25:36.420
that would be upset if you bought a lizard?

25:36.420 --> 25:40.820
But if you just like found a trash lizard outside,

25:40.820 --> 25:42.180
they'd be like, oh, dunk.

25:42.180 --> 25:43.540
I guess it's fate.

25:43.540 --> 25:46.100
You're gonna have to say you rescued the lizard

25:46.100 --> 25:49.140
from an owner that was maybe terrible.

25:49.140 --> 25:52.900
Some kind of elaborate like lizard heist

25:52.900 --> 25:54.980
to get a lizard out of a bad situation.

25:55.940 --> 25:57.220
This is not a bad idea.

25:57.220 --> 25:59.940
I tell you though, when my boy,

26:00.580 --> 26:02.260
he's gonna be a real scamp, I know it.

26:02.980 --> 26:04.580
When he brings the lizard into this home,

26:05.220 --> 26:07.140
if he says, I found this trash lizard outside

26:07.140 --> 26:08.820
and it's a bad, dirty lizard,

26:08.820 --> 26:11.060
and it's gross because it lived in the dirt for a long time

26:11.060 --> 26:12.260
and now it lives in the house

26:12.260 --> 26:14.980
and it's gonna bring dirt into the house and be awful,

26:14.980 --> 26:17.700
I will say, no, that's no good.

26:17.700 --> 26:20.020
If my little scamp boy says,

26:22.340 --> 26:24.580
I bought this lizard on Amazon

26:24.580 --> 26:26.020
and it was four and a half stars

26:26.020 --> 26:27.940
and it was Amazon Prime, so it was free shipping.

26:27.940 --> 26:30.420
I'd be like, hell yes, sick purchase.

26:31.540 --> 26:33.380
What's the lizard's name?

26:33.380 --> 26:35.460
Beautiful, beautiful lizard, excellent.

26:35.460 --> 26:36.980
I can see why it's so highly rated.

26:36.980 --> 26:39.380
This is an excellent lizard.

26:39.380 --> 26:41.780
How long after clicking confirm purchase

26:41.780 --> 26:44.740
do you think that this person posted this on Yahoo Answers?

26:45.620 --> 26:48.100
Like, ooh, shit, oh, that's right.

26:48.100 --> 26:51.860
Okay, but okay, let's help this person.

26:51.860 --> 26:53.620
I guess plan an inverse heist.

26:53.620 --> 26:55.940
What you're gonna have to do,

26:57.380 --> 26:58.660
you're gonna have to tell your parents

26:58.660 --> 27:00.740
you found the lizard in the house

27:02.180 --> 27:03.460
and then maybe you can angle

27:03.460 --> 27:05.460
like it would never survive outside.

27:05.460 --> 27:08.020
This is a house lizard and you know what?

27:08.020 --> 27:09.300
Maybe it was here before us.

27:09.300 --> 27:11.860
Maybe it found us in its house.

27:11.860 --> 27:13.860
That's a power play, but if you can make it work.

27:14.500 --> 27:15.620
Okay, how about this?

27:15.620 --> 27:20.100
How about you find a bear and kill it

27:20.100 --> 27:22.340
and kill the bear and put it in the living room.

27:22.340 --> 27:23.620
Listen, hear me out.

27:24.500 --> 27:27.220
Kill the bear, put the bear in the living room,

27:27.780 --> 27:29.780
put the lizard on top of the bear

27:29.780 --> 27:32.180
and put a little bear blood around its mouth

27:32.180 --> 27:33.780
and then call on your parents really quick.

27:33.780 --> 27:37.140
Like, oh my God, guys, quick, hear a lizard.

27:37.140 --> 27:38.740
We saved us.

27:38.740 --> 27:40.020
We got a hero on our hands.

27:40.020 --> 27:42.660
Everybody quick, get in here to see this heroic lizard.

27:43.780 --> 27:44.740
It has to be something like this

27:44.740 --> 27:46.660
where you have to make the parents fall in love

27:46.660 --> 27:48.020
with the lizard and make it seem like

27:48.020 --> 27:50.420
you had nothing to do with the lizard's arrival.

27:50.420 --> 27:52.740
So I'm imagining, oh, I've got it.

27:52.740 --> 27:56.500
What if you put the lizard in their bedroom

27:57.700 --> 27:58.900
and they walk in and they're like,

27:58.900 --> 28:00.180
ah, a lizard, but then they look up

28:00.180 --> 28:01.220
and what do they see?

28:01.220 --> 28:03.620
It's a lizard web and in it, it says like,

28:03.620 --> 28:04.980
Dan's new best friend.

28:04.980 --> 28:07.060
So good.

28:07.060 --> 28:09.380
And it's like a beautiful glistening web

28:09.380 --> 28:10.740
and maybe there's a diamond necklace

28:10.740 --> 28:13.060
hanging from the web and the lizard winks.

28:14.100 --> 28:15.060
Perfect.

28:15.060 --> 28:16.740
Could you try to convince them

28:16.740 --> 28:20.420
that it is a reincarnated deceased family member?

28:20.420 --> 28:22.740
Could you try to ask it things

28:22.740 --> 28:26.020
that only Unky Phil would know?

28:26.020 --> 28:28.660
And just trivia about Unky Phil,

28:28.660 --> 28:30.740
put it in some of his favorite shirts, that kind of thing.

28:30.740 --> 28:32.980
So it could be like, oh, if this is Unky Phil,

28:32.980 --> 28:35.140
not Uncle Phil from Fresh Prince of Bel Air,

28:35.140 --> 28:38.900
but Unky Phil, a wholly different entity,

28:39.780 --> 28:41.300
then what I want you to do, lizard,

28:41.300 --> 28:43.540
is stand really still for a long time

28:43.540 --> 28:45.940
and then just like dart somewhere all crazy like

28:45.940 --> 28:47.220
and kind of scary.

28:47.220 --> 28:48.420
Oh, he did it.

28:48.420 --> 28:51.220
Oh, he darted just like Unky Phil used to dart.

28:51.860 --> 28:53.780
He sat very still for a long time though

28:53.780 --> 28:55.940
and was very boring and a bad pet also.

28:56.820 --> 28:58.980
Also not a great pet.

28:58.980 --> 29:00.180
Were you buying lizards online

29:00.180 --> 29:01.780
and getting them shipped to your home?

29:01.780 --> 29:04.020
How is that a service that's being offered?

29:04.820 --> 29:06.260
That's a good question, actually.

29:06.260 --> 29:07.140
I have a solution.

29:07.140 --> 29:07.940
This is good.

29:07.940 --> 29:08.900
I think this could work.

29:09.540 --> 29:11.540
What you need to do is you're gonna like,

29:11.540 --> 29:13.700
whatever your surreptitious ordering is,

29:13.700 --> 29:15.540
you're gonna have to order all the stuff for the lizard too.

29:15.540 --> 29:18.340
You know, the terrarium, the equipment, all that stuff.

29:18.340 --> 29:20.340
Then you're just gonna have to put the lizard in your room

29:20.340 --> 29:20.980
in that terrarium.

29:20.980 --> 29:21.620
Don't hide it.

29:22.260 --> 29:24.900
And then your parents will at some point

29:24.900 --> 29:26.420
walk by the room and go,

29:26.420 --> 29:27.700
when did you get a lizard?

29:27.700 --> 29:29.940
And you're going to say, what do you mean?

29:29.940 --> 29:32.340
I've had that lizard forever for like years.

29:33.300 --> 29:36.100
And then if your parents continue to confront you about it,

29:36.100 --> 29:37.860
now you turn it on them and say,

29:37.860 --> 29:40.500
do you not take any interest in my life whatsoever?

29:40.500 --> 29:42.340
Has it really taken you this long

29:42.340 --> 29:44.900
to figure I have a lizard and now they're guilty

29:44.900 --> 29:46.260
and they'll buy you a second lizard?

29:46.980 --> 29:48.420
To put on top of that one.

29:48.420 --> 29:50.420
Yes, so that your lizard need not to be lonely.

29:53.780 --> 29:55.220
It's gonna make a Rango joke,

29:55.220 --> 29:56.580
but there's just nothing there.

29:57.460 --> 29:59.300
Maybe make your parents watch Rango,

29:59.300 --> 30:01.540
have them fall in love with lizards like you have.

30:01.540 --> 30:04.180
How to make your parents think you found a DVD of Rango,

30:04.180 --> 30:05.700
even though you bought Rango online.

30:07.140 --> 30:09.300
Yeah, I just found it, it's floating in the creek.

30:09.300 --> 30:11.380
Oh no, it might be a haunted Rango.

30:11.380 --> 30:12.420
Don't watch that.

30:12.420 --> 30:14.980
Seven days later, Rango will actually come to your house.

30:14.980 --> 30:15.860
Hi, Rango.

30:15.860 --> 30:17.300
I love you very much.

30:17.300 --> 30:20.180
I bet the hardest kind of person to connect with

30:20.820 --> 30:24.100
is a person that has just bought a lizard online

30:24.100 --> 30:25.940
that has not yet arrived.

30:25.940 --> 30:27.620
Cause you know there's nothing

30:27.620 --> 30:29.940
they're gonna wanna talk about other than the fact

30:29.940 --> 30:31.940
that they've got a lizard on the way

30:31.940 --> 30:33.700
and making some plans for that lizard.

30:34.260 --> 30:36.740
There will also be no getting them out of the house

30:36.740 --> 30:38.980
lest they miss the delivery.

30:38.980 --> 30:39.460
That's a good point.

30:39.460 --> 30:41.620
That's actually a very sincere problem

30:41.620 --> 30:43.700
because I don't think lizard care is high

30:43.700 --> 30:46.500
on UPS standard practices.

30:48.260 --> 30:51.140
Yeah, I mean the plans that you're going to be talking about

30:51.140 --> 30:54.420
when waiting for your lizard delivery is,

30:54.420 --> 30:57.780
I mean just one plan and it is a lizard funeral

30:57.780 --> 31:01.860
because that won't survive that.

31:01.860 --> 31:03.140
There's no way.

31:03.140 --> 31:05.940
Unless it's being hand delivered by a guy

31:05.940 --> 31:07.460
from the lizard store.

31:07.460 --> 31:08.340
That's the only other way

31:08.340 --> 31:10.500
cause otherwise if this thing's going through FedEx,

31:10.500 --> 31:11.860
first of all, I don't want it to touch

31:11.860 --> 31:13.700
all of the other packages in FedEx.

31:13.700 --> 31:15.460
Sorry guys, we had to return everything to sender

31:15.460 --> 31:16.900
cause it might've gotten touched by a lizard.

31:16.900 --> 31:19.780
So throw it right in the garbage when it gets back.

31:19.780 --> 31:22.100
Not only that, when the lizard store ships it to you,

31:22.100 --> 31:24.580
they don't know what kind of wonderful twists and turns

31:24.580 --> 31:26.020
the package is gonna take on its way.

31:26.020 --> 31:28.580
It's just like, okay, we need to put 11 crickets in here

31:28.580 --> 31:29.860
or whatever the fuck.

31:29.860 --> 31:30.740
It's not a good idea.

31:30.740 --> 31:32.180
Don't order lizards, folks.

31:32.180 --> 31:33.300
Don't order a lizard.

31:33.300 --> 31:35.140
There's plenty of farm fresh lizards

31:35.140 --> 31:36.660
just waiting to be adopted.

31:36.660 --> 31:37.460
Let's get the money's done.

31:37.460 --> 31:38.740
And buy our own lizards.

31:38.740 --> 31:39.300
Hell yes.

31:39.300 --> 31:52.020
You know, I had two lizards growing up.

31:52.020 --> 31:53.940
And for the life of me, I can't remember how I got them.

31:54.500 --> 31:56.420
You did have two lizards.

31:56.420 --> 31:56.660
Yeah.

31:56.660 --> 31:57.780
Or where did they go?

31:57.780 --> 31:58.180
I don't remember.

31:58.180 --> 31:59.940
Well, I mean, they eventually died,

31:59.940 --> 32:01.700
but I had them for like four years.

32:01.700 --> 32:02.900
Of lizard-itis.

32:02.900 --> 32:06.340
And I think that some kid just like gave me a shoe box

32:06.340 --> 32:08.340
and was like, hey, do you want these lizards?

32:08.340 --> 32:09.780
And I was like, yeah.

32:09.780 --> 32:11.220
And as a credit to mom and dad,

32:11.220 --> 32:13.780
they were like, I guess we're just a family

32:13.780 --> 32:15.460
that has lizards now.

32:15.460 --> 32:18.420
In fairness, they thought you'd kill them much, much quicker.

32:18.420 --> 32:19.380
That is true.

32:19.380 --> 32:21.380
I don't think they anticipated having to deal

32:21.380 --> 32:23.780
with the idea of having lizards for quite so long.

32:23.780 --> 32:25.700
So you were in middle school, right?

32:26.260 --> 32:27.540
I believe so, yes.

32:27.540 --> 32:31.540
So they were probably named Zanth and-

32:31.540 --> 32:32.980
Maybe, actually.

32:32.980 --> 32:34.580
That's quite possible, Griffin.

32:34.580 --> 32:36.420
Hey guys, tell me about Trunk Club.

32:36.420 --> 32:40.820
Trunk Club is a service which will,

32:41.700 --> 32:43.140
you're gonna get a personal stylist, right?

32:43.140 --> 32:44.020
Let me walk you through it.

32:44.020 --> 32:44.820
You get a personal stylist.

32:44.820 --> 32:45.460
What's their name?

32:45.460 --> 32:47.940
You're gonna tell them, Durmbum.

32:48.740 --> 32:49.460
And you're gonna tell them-

32:49.460 --> 32:50.020
Take it again.

32:51.300 --> 32:52.500
Kronzlum.

32:52.500 --> 32:53.140
Take a third.

32:54.740 --> 32:56.020
French Allure.

32:56.020 --> 32:56.980
Take a fourth.

32:56.980 --> 32:57.940
What's wrong with you?

32:58.980 --> 32:59.780
Pinsky.

33:00.500 --> 33:01.780
That's the best one yet.

33:01.780 --> 33:02.500
Dan.

33:02.500 --> 33:03.220
Pinsky Dan.

33:03.220 --> 33:06.980
So you're gonna get a call from a stylist and you're gonna-

33:06.980 --> 33:09.140
Hello, this is Pinsky Dan.

33:10.500 --> 33:12.100
What kind of pants do you like?

33:14.820 --> 33:17.060
Kronzlor, do we have slacks?

33:17.060 --> 33:25.300
You're gonna get a call from a stylist.

33:25.300 --> 33:29.140
They're gonna ask you what size everything is down there.

33:29.140 --> 33:30.500
And the dick?

33:30.500 --> 33:33.220
The dick?

33:33.220 --> 33:34.420
Excellent, excellent.

33:35.140 --> 33:37.300
Kronzlor, you'll never believe what he said about the dick.

33:39.860 --> 33:41.380
What's your measurement around the town?

33:43.780 --> 33:46.900
All kinds of measurements to them, both real and fictional.

33:47.460 --> 33:50.500
And they're gonna send you some garments that you're going to love.

33:50.500 --> 33:52.820
They're gonna ask you, what are you doing out in the town?

33:53.460 --> 33:56.020
Professional, casual, fun, flirty?

33:56.020 --> 33:56.820
What's your look?

33:56.820 --> 34:01.060
They're gonna ask you your loin weight.

34:01.060 --> 34:04.500
They're gonna send you a box of clothes and you're gonna try them on.

34:04.500 --> 34:05.860
And the stuff you like, you keep.

34:05.860 --> 34:10.020
The stuff you don't like, you ship right back to them in the aforementioned titular trunk.

34:11.380 --> 34:12.260
And here's the thing.

34:12.260 --> 34:16.660

I would like to tell you about Bowl and Branch.

34:55.940 --> 34:57.460
Just fucking do it then.

34:57.460 --> 34:58.820
It's a new way to sheet.

34:59.540 --> 34:59.780
Okay.

35:00.420 --> 35:02.180
That's the slogan I'm going with for this.

35:03.380 --> 35:07.780
We sleep on Bowl and Branch sheets and we also use Bowl and Branch bath towels.

35:07.780 --> 35:09.620
And they've got like a whole other slew of stuff.

35:09.620 --> 35:12.660
They got like duvet covers and blankets and that kind of thing.

35:12.660 --> 35:15.780
And it's just, and no exaggeration, the most like comfortable,

35:15.780 --> 35:18.740
softest sheets I've ever slept on, towels I've ever used.

35:18.740 --> 35:22.660
When Teresa and I moved across the country, we had the sheets shipped to us

35:22.660 --> 35:24.260
so we could use them right away.

35:24.820 --> 35:26.420
And, you know, here's the thing.

35:26.420 --> 35:29.460
They don't worry about thread count because thread count is a myth.

35:29.460 --> 35:31.860
They just focus on having like a really great product

35:31.860 --> 35:34.180
and using really wonderful materials.

35:34.180 --> 35:38.660
There's no huge markup because they don't like do retail space or anything like that.

35:38.660 --> 35:43.140
You get it at the right cost for the, you know, the right fit for you,

35:43.140 --> 35:44.500
right price, all that stuff.

I want to tell you about Metal Energy, that's M-E-T-T-L-E, energy.

36:20.660 --> 36:25.300
I want you to visit metalenergy.com and use the coupon code MYBROTHER

36:27.940 --> 36:29.140
What is Metal Energy?

36:29.140 --> 36:32.980
Well, they sell energy drink mixes that cost as little as 45 cents each

36:32.980 --> 36:37.460
and they come in flavors like sour blue raspberry, green apple and tropical cooler.

36:37.460 --> 36:40.180
If you drink energy drinks or shots and don't buy these,

36:40.180 --> 36:42.100
then you are overpaying on the reg.

36:42.100 --> 36:43.140
That's dumb.

36:43.140 --> 36:44.820
Don't be a dumb idiot with a stupid face.

36:44.820 --> 36:46.420
I'm sorry to come at you so aggressive like this,

36:46.420 --> 36:49.300
but this is the literal ad copy, which is what you are

36:49.300 --> 36:52.660
if you don't treat your energy drink habit at metalenergy.com.

36:52.660 --> 36:54.020
You're going to drink these energy drinks.

36:54.580 --> 36:56.420
You're going to jump higher.

36:56.420 --> 36:57.700
You're going to jump more.

36:58.660 --> 37:01.380
You will be jumping more often than you do now.

37:01.940 --> 37:03.220
I've tried these.

37:03.220 --> 37:03.460
Have you?

37:03.460 --> 37:04.420
Yeah, they sent some to me too.

37:04.420 --> 37:05.460
They're great.

37:05.460 --> 37:07.060
They taste really good actually.

37:07.060 --> 37:07.620
Where's mine?

37:07.620 --> 37:08.900
I didn't get any go-go juice.

37:08.900 --> 37:09.540
What the fuck?

37:09.540 --> 37:12.180
You should have taken some with you when you were at the house.

37:12.180 --> 37:16.500
They know that I have my own natural energy, which is cocaine.

37:17.700 --> 37:21.700
This message is for Justin, Travis and Griffin.

37:21.700 --> 37:24.740
It's from Isaac and Isaac asks us,

37:25.460 --> 37:26.900
how's that hundo treating you?

37:28.020 --> 37:30.500
I'm assuming he's talking about the money that he paid for this Jumbotron

37:30.500 --> 37:34.340
and to which I will say we don't get all of that

37:34.340 --> 37:35.700
and then we split it three ways.

37:35.700 --> 37:39.380
So I will buy some Arby's with it later.

37:39.380 --> 37:41.300
Thank you for the Arby's, Isaac.

37:41.300 --> 37:42.500
I appreciate that.

37:42.500 --> 37:46.260
Thank you so much, Isaac, for your consideration and for not.

37:46.260 --> 37:49.460
I mean, you know, folks, I can't tell you this enough.

37:49.460 --> 37:50.500
It's your hundo.

37:50.500 --> 37:50.740
Yeah.

37:50.740 --> 37:51.780
Do whatever you want with it.

37:51.780 --> 37:52.420
You know what I mean?

37:53.940 --> 37:55.060
This is a good way to do it.

37:55.060 --> 37:56.340
Just like, I like this.

37:56.340 --> 37:59.540
This is essentially just like a bank transaction.

38:00.420 --> 38:01.060
Hi everybody.

38:01.060 --> 38:02.500
Hi Griffin, Justin and Travis.

38:02.500 --> 38:03.620
My name is Isaac.

38:03.620 --> 38:05.300
I have given you a hundred dollars.

38:05.300 --> 38:06.340
This is, that is all.

38:06.340 --> 38:09.700
Well, I like this because it's also, it's both generosity

38:09.700 --> 38:13.140
and just a little susan of throwing it in our face.

38:13.860 --> 38:14.100
Yeah.

38:14.100 --> 38:15.620
Like here, take my money.

38:15.620 --> 38:16.660
How's that treat you?

38:16.660 --> 38:18.500
It treats me good.

38:18.500 --> 38:19.300
Thank you, Isaac.

38:19.300 --> 38:20.260
Thank you for your money.

38:21.540 --> 38:24.420
I'm Jesse Thorne and I'm curious about Jonathan Van Ness

38:24.420 --> 38:26.020
and his show, Getting Curious.

38:26.020 --> 38:28.420
What were you most excited to learn something about?

38:28.420 --> 38:30.660
I was really excited about the Romanoffs.

38:30.660 --> 38:31.700
I was really excited.

38:31.700 --> 38:32.980
Why were you so excited about the Romanoffs?

38:32.980 --> 38:34.980
Well, because I've been obsessed with things listening to the episode.

38:34.980 --> 38:35.620
I'm just kidding.

38:35.620 --> 38:36.420
I'm just kidding.

38:36.420 --> 38:39.140
Because I've been obsessed with them since I was 11

38:39.140 --> 38:40.340
from the movie Anastasia.

38:40.900 --> 38:42.260
Jonathan, what's a baby brain?

38:43.140 --> 38:44.980
It's a brain that's finally ready to explore.

38:45.620 --> 38:48.100
Getting Curious, a show for your baby brain.

38:48.100 --> 38:49.700
Download it wherever you get podcasts.

38:51.300 --> 38:52.740
I have another question.

38:52.740 --> 38:55.300
Sorry, some prankster is leaf blowing right outside my house

38:55.300 --> 38:57.780
and it's like pretty good prank.

38:57.780 --> 38:58.580
What a jokester.

38:59.620 --> 39:00.420
Let me look.

39:00.420 --> 39:01.540
It's Jamie Kennedy.

39:02.260 --> 39:03.140
Oh man.

39:03.140 --> 39:04.500
Blowing my yard.

39:04.500 --> 39:06.580
So Trap, how do you think the episode is going so far?

39:06.580 --> 39:08.180
You know, so far, so good, Justin.

39:08.180 --> 39:09.540
I want a munch.

39:10.260 --> 39:11.380
Squad, sorry.

39:11.380 --> 39:11.700
Jamie Kennedy is just-

39:11.700 --> 39:15.780
No, I'm not gonna do it when you set me up to be interrupted.

39:15.780 --> 39:17.140
You don't get my squad.

39:17.940 --> 39:21.220
Okay, well, Griffin, how you think the show is going so far?

39:22.740 --> 39:22.980
Fuck you.

39:22.980 --> 39:24.420
I want a munch.

39:24.420 --> 39:24.980
Squad.

39:27.460 --> 39:29.540
I want too much.

39:29.540 --> 39:30.020
Squad.

39:30.020 --> 39:36.820
Squad, Jack in the Box is making its first appearance here

39:36.820 --> 39:37.860
on the Munch Squad.

39:37.860 --> 39:40.740
That's amazing because they sell like tacos and spaghetti

39:40.740 --> 39:41.540
in the same box.

39:42.100 --> 39:44.580
Well, things are about to get even more confusing

39:44.580 --> 39:46.740
because today we're not the Munch Squad.

39:46.740 --> 39:47.940
We're not just the Munch Squad.

39:47.940 --> 39:49.220
We're still the Munch Squad.

39:49.220 --> 39:50.740
We're also the Brunch Squad.

39:50.740 --> 39:51.620
Oh God.

39:51.620 --> 39:54.500
Because Jack in the Box is launching a new level of

39:54.500 --> 39:57.380
craveability with Brunch Fest.

39:58.100 --> 39:58.420
Okay.

39:58.420 --> 39:59.620
Now I know what you're saying.

39:59.620 --> 40:00.580
No, fuck off.

40:00.580 --> 40:01.300
You can't just-

40:01.300 --> 40:02.580
It's Brunchner.

40:02.580 --> 40:06.020
It's all the meals and you just get it shot into your face.

40:07.380 --> 40:08.900
It ain't that far off.

40:08.900 --> 40:10.020
Oh God.

40:10.020 --> 40:13.780
But Jack in the Box has always served breakfast all day.

40:13.780 --> 40:16.980
Not only that, fucking brunch already is the words.

40:16.980 --> 40:18.100
Breakfast and lunch.

40:18.100 --> 40:21.860
You don't need to get a fucking reprise there at the end

40:21.860 --> 40:23.780
coming at you with the epilogue.

40:25.700 --> 40:27.620
Okay, 1969 is the year.

40:27.620 --> 40:31.940
A man named Jack introduces the very first breakfast sandwich.

40:32.740 --> 40:36.900
And in 2013, they introduced Jack's Munchie Meals,

40:36.900 --> 40:39.780
which is something else at late times.

40:39.780 --> 40:40.980
I'm sorry, are you reading?

40:40.980 --> 40:43.380
Are you, this is the worst press release I've ever heard.

40:43.380 --> 40:44.180
Are you making this up?

40:44.180 --> 40:46.420
Brunch Fest, Mary, what is Brunch Fest?

40:46.420 --> 40:47.940
I know you're confused.

40:47.940 --> 40:50.660
This is a first in the industry, according to the press release.

40:50.660 --> 40:52.180
A first in the industry.

40:52.180 --> 40:54.740
Brunch Fest, Mary, is the unique flavors of brunch

40:54.740 --> 40:56.980
with the convenience and anytime availability

40:56.980 --> 41:00.180
that guests can always expect from Jack in the Box.

41:00.820 --> 41:01.620
What?

41:01.620 --> 41:05.780
Then why, I am fucking furious right now.

41:07.300 --> 41:10.340
Jack's Brunch Fest menu features items

41:10.340 --> 41:12.740
that make brunch an everyday occasion.

41:12.740 --> 41:13.380
What?

41:13.380 --> 41:16.740
Guests can choose from three entrees,

41:16.740 --> 41:20.340
including the bacon, egg and chicken sandwich.

41:21.060 --> 41:23.300
What you got there is a toasted English muffin

41:23.300 --> 41:24.740
with crispy chicken filet.

41:24.740 --> 41:27.620
And then it's got bacon and cheese and bacon mayo

41:27.620 --> 41:29.940
and a freshly cracked fried egg.

41:29.940 --> 41:32.260
Hey, freshly cracked is a crazy way

41:32.260 --> 41:35.700
of just making a fried egg sound delicious, excuse me.

41:36.420 --> 41:38.180
Yeah, freshly cracked.

41:38.180 --> 41:40.100
Mm, good, very good.

41:40.100 --> 41:40.740
Good, I guess.

41:41.300 --> 41:42.900
What's the alternative, sorry?

41:43.460 --> 41:45.620
Yeah, we squeezed these down about a week ago.

41:46.580 --> 41:49.540
Freshly unzipped from an individual Ziploc bag.

41:50.900 --> 41:54.020
The brunch burger is a buttery croissant

41:54.020 --> 41:55.860
topped with a juicy beef patty

41:56.580 --> 41:58.420
and a freshly cracked fried egg.

41:58.420 --> 41:59.380
Yeah, okay.

41:59.380 --> 42:01.460
So you guys put egg on shit.

42:01.460 --> 42:03.220
I have, go ahead and read the third option

42:03.220 --> 42:04.900
and then I'm gonna yell and yell and yell

42:04.900 --> 42:05.860
until I fall asleep.

42:06.820 --> 42:09.220
Well, you got a Southwest scrambler plate.

42:09.220 --> 42:11.700
That's scrambled eggs with roasted peppers,

42:11.700 --> 42:14.500
diced green chilies, pepper jack cheese

42:15.060 --> 42:17.140
and then served with homestyle potatoes.

42:17.140 --> 42:17.380
Okay.

42:17.380 --> 42:20.180
Hickory smoked bacon or sausage

42:20.180 --> 42:21.620
and a buttery croissant.

42:21.620 --> 42:23.780
I have excellent news for Jack in the Box.

42:23.780 --> 42:25.380
I'm giving you a one out of three.

42:26.820 --> 42:29.460
You barely skated by without getting a zero

42:29.460 --> 42:31.300
because that is brunch, what you've just described.

42:31.300 --> 42:33.540
It has breakfast and lunch elements in it.

42:35.940 --> 42:37.460
When you put an egg on a burger,

42:38.340 --> 42:39.860
it doesn't make it a breakfast time.

42:40.660 --> 42:42.100
It shouldn't even be around breakfast time.

42:42.100 --> 42:43.780
It's a fucking burger.

42:43.780 --> 42:47.060
And it's certainly not deserving of having the word breakfast

42:47.060 --> 42:48.660
in the name of the meal twice.

42:48.660 --> 42:51.940
At the very least, what you've made is Le Brunch Unch

42:51.940 --> 42:55.540
which is double lunch in the word, you big dumb animal.

42:55.540 --> 42:58.500
That's fair because I don't know, maybe there exists

42:58.500 --> 43:00.740
but brunch is like a thing now

43:00.740 --> 43:03.140
with like a defined set of parameters.

43:03.140 --> 43:05.620
It's not just putting an egg on something.

43:06.580 --> 43:10.340
Like you can't be like, I made a catfish

43:10.340 --> 43:13.220
and I put a freshly cracked egg on it.

43:13.220 --> 43:14.020
It's brunch now.

43:14.580 --> 43:17.140
You can't pour gravy on Captain Crunch

43:17.140 --> 43:18.660
and say, look, I did a brunch.

43:18.660 --> 43:20.260
You didn't really do a brunch.

43:20.260 --> 43:22.740
What you did was a crime sin.

43:22.740 --> 43:24.420
But what does it matter to us?

43:24.420 --> 43:26.740
We are not industry professionals

43:26.740 --> 43:30.020
like Iwona Alter, Jack of the Box's vice president

43:30.020 --> 43:32.500
of product marketing who says, and I quote,

43:33.140 --> 43:35.380
brunch enthusiasts no longer have to wait

43:35.380 --> 43:38.340
until the weekend to satisfy their brunch cravings.

43:39.220 --> 43:40.260
Thank God.

43:40.260 --> 43:44.580
With Brunchfest, we're giving our guests 24 seven access

43:44.580 --> 43:47.540
to the distinct craveable flavors of brunch

43:47.540 --> 43:52.500
whenever they want it and wherever the hunger strikes.

43:52.500 --> 43:53.940
Hey, you motherfuckers.

43:53.940 --> 43:58.260
If you eat brunch at any time other than brunch time,

43:58.260 --> 43:59.300
it's breakfast or lunch.

43:59.300 --> 44:00.500
It's one of the other meals.

44:01.540 --> 44:03.940
You can't have brunch at 7 p.m.

44:04.900 --> 44:09.300
Who are these people that are living such lives

44:09.300 --> 44:12.500
of desperation where they say to themselves,

44:13.140 --> 44:16.260
I would fucking kill for brunch food right now

44:16.260 --> 44:20.180
but I don't know how to obtain it.

44:20.180 --> 44:22.260
I need someone to deliver that to me

44:22.260 --> 44:25.380
because I don't know how to get that experience at home.

44:26.020 --> 44:28.180
I need someone to save me.

44:28.820 --> 44:30.980
Justin, take it one step further.

44:30.980 --> 44:33.460
They're then so desperate that they're just glad

44:33.460 --> 44:36.260
there's an option like Jack of the Box

44:36.260 --> 44:38.260
to fulfill their brunch craving.

44:38.260 --> 44:40.420
That's, they just need it so bad.

44:40.420 --> 44:42.820
Justin just sent a photo and I don't want to know.

44:43.940 --> 44:44.500
I'm afraid.

44:44.500 --> 44:45.140
You should look at it

44:45.140 --> 44:46.740
because it's insane.

44:47.380 --> 44:50.580
It looks like somebody stacked a meal on top of another meal.

44:51.700 --> 44:54.020
It's like, yeah, the first time you hear the word brunch

44:54.020 --> 44:56.740
when you are a child and your brain can't understand

44:56.740 --> 45:00.100
how like ideas can compound into a bigger single idea

45:00.100 --> 45:01.940
and you think like, yeah, we're gonna have brunch.

45:01.940 --> 45:02.580
What does that mean?

45:02.580 --> 45:04.260
You're gonna put like cereal on a burger?

45:04.260 --> 45:06.020
It's like, no, no, you dumb idiot.

45:06.020 --> 45:07.620
It's a whole different thing.

45:07.620 --> 45:10.900
Jack of the Box has realized that childlike vision

45:10.900 --> 45:15.700
of two meals that have combined in the worst possible way.

45:15.700 --> 45:17.620
It's like if you were about to sit down

45:17.620 --> 45:21.140
and enjoy a normal human breakfast

45:21.140 --> 45:24.500
and then an all powerful toddler came into the room and said,

45:24.500 --> 45:26.340
I wanna put my lunch in it.

45:26.340 --> 45:26.660
Yes.

45:26.660 --> 45:29.700
Like just, I wanna store my lunch in your breakfast.

45:30.340 --> 45:30.580
And the thing about-

45:30.580 --> 45:32.740
What these sandwiches look like to me

45:32.740 --> 45:35.700
is like you wanted to make a sausage egg and cheese

45:35.700 --> 45:38.180
and bacon sandwich, but you ran out of sausage.

45:38.180 --> 45:40.900
So you just like grabbed a frozen hamburger patty

45:40.900 --> 45:43.140
and you were like, now I'm a great chef

45:43.140 --> 45:44.660
and I've invented a new food.

45:44.660 --> 45:48.180
This is food that a very drunk person makes at 1 a.m.

45:49.220 --> 45:52.180
If anything, it's dinner fist, a combination of dinner

45:52.180 --> 45:54.260
and then wrapping all the way around a breakfast.

45:54.260 --> 45:56.900
This is fourth meal, which is already another thing.

45:56.900 --> 45:58.420
No, this is fifth meal, Griffin.

45:58.420 --> 45:59.460
This is fifth meal?

45:59.460 --> 46:01.460
This is something you have at four o'clock in the morning

46:01.460 --> 46:04.340
and you don't remember you had and you eat breakfast again.

46:04.340 --> 46:05.620
This is last meal.

46:05.620 --> 46:06.580
Like let's be honest.

46:06.580 --> 46:11.540
This is not, this is not, this is not the action

46:11.540 --> 46:14.020
of a person who continues their existence.

46:14.020 --> 46:16.740
This is not a meal you eat on purpose.

46:16.740 --> 46:20.820
Brunch, there is no such thing as brunch food, right?

46:20.820 --> 46:22.180
There are things that you eat at brunch

46:22.180 --> 46:25.380
but you could also just eat that stuff at lunch or breakfast.

46:25.380 --> 46:28.820
The reason brunch exists is because people like to have mimosas

46:28.820 --> 46:30.660
and they like to have a good excuse for it.

46:30.660 --> 46:33.780
If you are eating, you shouldn't eat brunch on a weekday.

46:33.780 --> 46:34.820
You shouldn't.

46:34.820 --> 46:37.780
I don't think you should be eating lunch on a brunch on a weekday.

46:37.780 --> 46:39.060
It doesn't make sense.

46:39.060 --> 46:41.860
You should be doing something else at 11 a.m.

46:41.860 --> 46:44.820
Brunch is a way of telling your body like,

46:44.820 --> 46:46.740
listen, you need a little extra sleep.

46:46.740 --> 46:49.220
Here, here, big fellow, let me put you back down.

46:49.220 --> 46:53.060
Here, let me fill you up with food

46:53.060 --> 46:54.900
and now I'm gonna put some mimosas in you.

46:54.900 --> 46:56.900
Oh, look in that warm sun, isn't that nice?

46:56.900 --> 46:58.420
Oh, that hammock looks inviting.

46:58.420 --> 46:59.300
Boom, you're out.

46:59.300 --> 47:00.500
See you on Monday.

47:01.060 --> 47:02.180
These are not the actions.

47:02.180 --> 47:03.940
That's not a midday break.

47:03.940 --> 47:07.300
You can't recover from brunch and go back to work.

47:07.300 --> 47:09.940
I spent so much time looking at this picture you sent,

47:09.940 --> 47:11.380
looking at the bad food on it

47:12.180 --> 47:14.340
and I just looked at the top part of it

47:14.340 --> 47:16.500
where it has the word brunch fist written out

47:16.500 --> 47:18.580
and I'm just fucking angry again

47:18.580 --> 47:21.540
because who the fuck do you think you are?

47:21.540 --> 47:23.780
It's the dumbest thing I've ever seen.

47:25.220 --> 47:27.220
But it's craveable and it's 24.

47:27.220 --> 47:29.140
No, it's not even a little bit craveable.

47:29.780 --> 47:31.060
It's highly craveable.

47:31.060 --> 47:34.500
They wouldn't lie, they can't lie about it.

47:34.500 --> 47:36.180
I'm gonna, there's a jag in the box around the corner.

47:36.180 --> 47:40.980
It is sadly the like nearest fast food place to me.

47:40.980 --> 47:41.940
Sometimes when I'm desperate,

47:41.940 --> 47:43.620
I'll go there and get one of their fajita wraps

47:43.620 --> 47:44.340
or whatever, it's okay.

47:45.060 --> 47:46.820
I wanna go and I wanna buy these

47:46.820 --> 47:48.500
and then I wanna take the cashier with me

47:48.500 --> 47:49.540
who hands me the things

47:49.540 --> 47:51.060
and go with them into the bathroom

47:51.060 --> 47:53.300
and make him watch me put it in the toilet.

47:53.300 --> 48:00.980
I'm a little, I mean, maybe I'm just feel differently

48:00.980 --> 48:03.140
about this because I don't have a jack in the box

48:03.140 --> 48:04.180
anywhere near me.

48:04.180 --> 48:07.060
So maybe it like exotic fruits.

48:07.060 --> 48:09.300
Yeah, I can't, I'd have to go to Cincinnati,

48:09.300 --> 48:10.180
I think to get into one.

48:10.180 --> 48:12.100
I have a Yahoo here, can I read it?

48:12.100 --> 48:12.660
Yeah, please.

48:12.660 --> 48:17.300
It was sent in by game recognized game Rachel Roseng.

48:17.300 --> 48:17.860
Thank you, Rachel.

48:17.860 --> 48:19.220
It's by Yahoo answers user.

48:19.220 --> 48:23.380
It's just guys, the name is just smoke weed.

48:23.380 --> 48:23.880
Cool.

48:24.580 --> 48:27.940
They say, can't get into TV series slash movies

48:27.940 --> 48:29.620
because I know they are just acting.

48:30.980 --> 48:32.980
Anytime I watch an interesting TV series,

48:32.980 --> 48:34.980
I may get into it for about a couple of minutes

48:34.980 --> 48:37.860
before the thought of them just memorizing some script

48:37.860 --> 48:40.020
and standing in front of a camera pops into my head,

48:40.020 --> 48:41.860
especially during those scenes

48:41.860 --> 48:44.260
where a character is not supposed to know

48:44.260 --> 48:46.020
the other characters stole something of theirs

48:46.020 --> 48:46.900
or something like that.

48:46.900 --> 48:48.500
And they act like they don't know.

48:48.500 --> 48:50.820
But since they are acting, they really do.

48:51.460 --> 48:52.820
Is anyone else like this?

48:52.820 --> 48:54.340
Is there any way to avoid this?

48:55.140 --> 48:56.500
Well, now I am.

48:57.940 --> 49:00.260
Damn it, you've poisoned the well.

49:00.260 --> 49:01.140
Everybody was talking like,

49:01.140 --> 49:02.980
oh, you gotta watch Westworld, Westworld's so tight.

49:02.980 --> 49:03.620
You gotta watch it.

49:03.620 --> 49:04.740
And I was like, I turned it on

49:04.740 --> 49:06.340
and I watched it and for a few minutes,

49:06.340 --> 49:07.620
I was like, okay, okay, okay.

49:07.620 --> 49:08.980
But then after a while, I was just like,

49:09.700 --> 49:11.220
that's just Anthony Hopkins.

49:12.580 --> 49:15.060
That's just Anthony Hopkins.

49:15.780 --> 49:16.740
Nice try.

49:16.740 --> 49:19.940
And somebody's like, the robots are getting all shitty

49:19.940 --> 49:20.500
out there.

49:20.500 --> 49:23.780
And he was like, oh, no, I can't believe it.

49:23.780 --> 49:26.420
And it's like, you did know it, Anthony.

49:26.420 --> 49:28.740
You read the script for this, I bet.

49:28.740 --> 49:31.060
Not only that, it's one step further for me, Gervan,

49:31.060 --> 49:32.100
because I look and I see it,

49:32.100 --> 49:33.460
it's Anthony Hopkins acting on the screen.

49:33.460 --> 49:35.540
But then I think, you know, like 10 feet

49:35.540 --> 49:36.900
right in front of Anthony Hopkins,

49:36.900 --> 49:38.100
just behind the camera,

49:38.100 --> 49:41.540
there's some dude like eating a bagel at craft services.

49:41.540 --> 49:43.460
They're not in Westworld at all.

49:43.460 --> 49:44.340
No, they're not.

49:44.340 --> 49:46.100
They're just in some building

49:46.100 --> 49:47.220
where they make TV shows.

49:48.420 --> 49:50.100
And like, upstairs from that,

49:50.100 --> 49:52.100
there's a guy taking a 10-2,

49:52.100 --> 49:54.100
and he had a bagel sandwich earlier.

49:54.100 --> 49:55.700
And then like down the hall from that,

49:55.700 --> 49:56.900
there's just like a woman,

49:56.900 --> 49:59.700
like just doing the accounting for the show.

49:59.700 --> 50:00.020
Yeah.

50:00.020 --> 50:02.500
I wish I was a director in Westworld,

50:02.500 --> 50:03.940
because I would love to like,

50:04.820 --> 50:08.180
yell cut after Anthony Hopkins finishes acting.

50:08.180 --> 50:10.820
It just would be like, mm, good acting.

50:11.780 --> 50:13.940
Like just really tell him like,

50:13.940 --> 50:16.500
man, you acted so good in that one.

50:16.500 --> 50:18.660
I thought you were that person for like a second.

50:18.660 --> 50:20.100
Well, yes, thank you.

50:20.100 --> 50:21.700
But then I didn't, of course,

50:21.700 --> 50:23.140
because you're Anthony Hopkins,

50:23.140 --> 50:24.980
and you're just reading.

50:24.980 --> 50:26.900
But like, sorry, Anthony,

50:26.900 --> 50:28.180
that was pretty good acting.

50:28.180 --> 50:30.420
I'm just gonna go ahead and lay it out there.

50:30.420 --> 50:33.140
Thank you for doing that so good on my TV show.

50:35.220 --> 50:37.380
This is now an all-encompassing thing for me.

50:37.380 --> 50:39.780
I watched the new Mission Impossible,

50:39.780 --> 50:40.580
and I watch it,

50:40.580 --> 50:45.540
and I'm not enthrilled by like a story of spy work and intrigue.

50:45.540 --> 50:46.740
I'm just thinking like,

50:46.740 --> 50:48.100
this seems dangerous for Tom.

50:48.740 --> 50:50.100
I don't want Tom to be doing this.

50:50.100 --> 50:51.860
I want to see him in the cocktails too.

50:51.860 --> 50:52.260
I don't want him to be in-

50:52.260 --> 50:53.300
That's actually a fair point,

50:53.300 --> 50:54.660
because Tom does a lot of his own stuff.

50:54.660 --> 50:55.860
Tom does most of his own stuff,

50:55.860 --> 50:57.060
and it's like, no, no, no, I don't.

50:57.060 --> 50:58.820
I can't even watch a Jackie Chan movie anymore,

50:58.820 --> 51:01.620
because it's like, I'm cool cop, cool too,

51:01.620 --> 51:02.900
and I have a magic tuxedo.

51:02.900 --> 51:04.100
It's like, you're not, you're Jackie Chan,

51:04.100 --> 51:05.460
and please, you're like 60, don't.

51:05.460 --> 51:06.660
Please don't hurt, you're so brittle.

51:06.660 --> 51:07.540
Don't.

51:07.540 --> 51:09.460
You know, I watched the new Star Trek movie,

51:09.460 --> 51:10.500
and I just thought the whole time,

51:10.500 --> 51:11.780
they're not even in space.

51:12.580 --> 51:13.540
This isn't real.

51:14.260 --> 51:15.700
They don't have laser guns,

51:16.260 --> 51:17.780
and I screamed that the whole time.

51:17.780 --> 51:19.060
I was asked to leave.

51:19.060 --> 51:20.020
That's why you're gonna,

51:20.020 --> 51:22.740
you're all really gonna like the My Brother, My Brother Me show,

51:22.740 --> 51:25.380
because everything that happened on it, happened.

51:25.380 --> 51:25.780
Yeah.

51:25.780 --> 51:26.820
It all happened.

51:26.820 --> 51:28.340
It's all real.

51:28.340 --> 51:32.260
It's realer than like any reality TV show that's ever been,

51:32.260 --> 51:35.220
because I was there for all of it, and it all happened.

51:35.220 --> 51:37.780
Yeah, no movie magic.

51:37.780 --> 51:40.340
Guys, I'm on Yahoo.

51:41.460 --> 51:42.260
Different ad.

51:43.300 --> 51:44.580
McCarthy's gone.

51:44.580 --> 51:46.740
The real reason Mike and Molly was canceled,

51:46.740 --> 51:48.260
and then a picture of Mike and Molly.

51:49.620 --> 51:51.140
What the fuck's, click through.

51:51.140 --> 51:52.980
It's E Online again, same thing.

51:52.980 --> 51:55.620
What the fuck are you guys, what's your ad campaign

51:56.340 --> 51:58.180
about the death of Melissa McCarthy?

51:58.740 --> 51:59.700
Because it sucks.

52:02.180 --> 52:05.300
It is a different, discreet, dead Melissa McCarthy ad.

52:05.300 --> 52:06.580
What the fuck is wrong with you?

52:06.580 --> 52:09.300
Why does E Online hate Melissa McCarthy so much?

52:09.300 --> 52:12.580
And why is Yahoo like, another good ad, bring them on in.

52:13.620 --> 52:18.740
Melissa McCarthy's mom is on Yahoo.

52:18.740 --> 52:20.260
How do you think that feels for her?

52:20.260 --> 52:21.700
She's just trying to figure out like,

52:21.700 --> 52:23.940
how to get a frog out of her butt,

52:23.940 --> 52:26.420
or whatever people on Yahoo answers are doing.

52:26.420 --> 52:28.820
And then she sees that her daughter died?

52:28.820 --> 52:29.060
Yeah.

52:29.060 --> 52:30.820
Griffin, what kind of things have you been searching?

52:30.820 --> 52:33.860
What kind of cookies do you have that like algorithms are like-

52:33.860 --> 52:36.020
Just like the usual stuff.

52:36.020 --> 52:38.820
Like the cast of Mike and Molly, comma, but dead.

52:38.820 --> 52:42.180
Oh, that was, what the fuck, dog?

52:43.060 --> 52:45.380
I bet if you buy a lizard on Amazon,

52:45.380 --> 52:47.220
your cookies are irredeemable.

52:47.220 --> 52:49.380
You're not gonna know what to do with those cookies.

52:49.380 --> 52:49.860
Yeah, for sure.

52:53.460 --> 52:55.620
I can't watch Mike and Molly,

52:55.620 --> 52:59.140
because it's like, these two people are in love.

52:59.140 --> 53:00.900
But I can't, because they aren't.

53:00.900 --> 53:06.180
Because it's Melissa McCarthy and whoever Mike is.

53:06.180 --> 53:07.540
And they're not, I know they're not.

53:08.260 --> 53:09.380
What I like to do,

53:09.380 --> 53:13.220
is I like to suspend my disbelief so very hard,

53:13.220 --> 53:15.220
that then I start to worry that the show

53:15.220 --> 53:16.740
will come to a crashing halt,

53:16.740 --> 53:19.860
when they realize someone has planted a camera in their kitchen,

53:19.860 --> 53:22.100
to watch them like have hilarious banter.

53:22.100 --> 53:22.500
Oh shit.

53:22.500 --> 53:24.820
And they'll see the camera and become horrified,

53:24.820 --> 53:27.460
like someone's been watching us the whole time, Debra.

53:28.020 --> 53:28.260
Oh my god.

53:28.260 --> 53:32.500
And it would go, like it would get so terrifyingly real.

53:32.500 --> 53:34.580
What if in the last season of Mike and Molly,

53:34.580 --> 53:36.660
they realized it was a TV show,

53:36.660 --> 53:38.500
and that their lives were a TV show,

53:38.500 --> 53:41.220
and the whole last season is just about them,

53:41.220 --> 53:43.620
like truman showing the whole thing out.

53:43.620 --> 53:45.300
God, that's fucking good, please.

53:45.300 --> 53:47.780
I've never wanted to watch Mike and Molly,

53:47.780 --> 53:50.100
even with 1% of my being.

53:50.100 --> 53:52.820
Melissa McCarthy has the juice to get that done.

53:52.820 --> 53:55.140
She has got like, I'll come back for one more,

53:55.140 --> 53:56.980
but strap in, because it's getting weird.

53:56.980 --> 53:59.140
It's gonna get fucking Roseanne weird in here.

53:59.140 --> 54:01.380
We're gonna Roseanne the shit out of this, you guys.

54:03.540 --> 54:04.820
Let me ask you guys a question.

54:06.900 --> 54:14.740
Do you think there's ever been a TV show or movies that was real?

54:21.540 --> 54:23.940
Do you mean like it was...

54:23.940 --> 54:25.860
I mean, I get that it's all like,

54:25.860 --> 54:27.060
that's Anthony Hopkins up there,

54:27.060 --> 54:32.820
and he's reading words that the HBO writer gave him to say,

54:32.820 --> 54:35.860
and he says them really, really cool,

54:36.420 --> 54:39.860
and he says them like, sometimes he says them really sad,

54:40.500 --> 54:42.660
he is having the feelings that the words,

54:42.660 --> 54:44.580
the person who in the story would be saying the words,

54:44.580 --> 54:46.340
but it's Anthony Hopkins just reading the words

54:46.340 --> 54:47.700
in a specific way, right?

54:47.700 --> 54:49.220
I'm not fooled by Westworld,

54:49.220 --> 54:54.260
but maybe one of the shows is a real show, or a movie.

54:54.260 --> 54:56.260
If there was one show, Griffin, that you thought,

54:56.260 --> 54:58.180
what's the most likely suspect?

55:00.340 --> 55:03.940
I mean, probably one where it's a thing that really does it,

55:03.940 --> 55:05.380
like Law and Order.

55:05.380 --> 55:07.940
There really are cops and judges and stuff out there,

55:07.940 --> 55:09.300
but I don't know.

55:09.300 --> 55:10.820
What about Seinfeld?

55:11.700 --> 55:13.460
Seinfeld, I think, was probably...

55:14.740 --> 55:16.180
Well, again, it's hard to say,

55:16.180 --> 55:17.060
because a lot of that was...

55:17.780 --> 55:18.820
I would say I was down with that,

55:18.820 --> 55:20.180
but then there would be the segments of Seinfeld

55:20.180 --> 55:21.380
where he was doing stand-up comedy,

55:21.380 --> 55:23.300
and it's like, but he really does do that.

55:23.300 --> 55:24.340
That one gets too confusing.

55:24.340 --> 55:25.940
I can't even start to unpack that.

55:25.940 --> 55:28.100
Here's what I'd like to pause it.

55:28.100 --> 55:30.260
I think the NCIS New Orleans,

55:30.260 --> 55:32.900
starring Scott Bakula, is probably real,

55:32.900 --> 55:35.300
because let me lay it out for you.

55:35.300 --> 55:36.340
You're Scott Bakula.

55:36.340 --> 55:38.580
You're a true professional, right?

55:38.580 --> 55:40.820
You won't be on our podcast or on our TV show,

55:40.820 --> 55:41.780
but you're a professional.

55:41.780 --> 55:43.940
That only proves you're a true professional.

55:43.940 --> 55:45.220
See above, true professional.

55:45.780 --> 55:47.460
And you wanna learn about cop work, right?

55:47.460 --> 55:49.940
So you're like, well, I better learn what a NCIS does

55:49.940 --> 55:50.900
or what that's about.

55:50.900 --> 55:52.820
I think it's something with crime

55:52.820 --> 55:54.020
or the military.

55:54.020 --> 55:57.220
New cops in the city.

55:57.940 --> 55:59.860
New cops in the city with an S.

56:00.660 --> 56:02.980
And so you're gonna learn all that cop shit, right?

56:02.980 --> 56:03.460
Yeah.

56:03.460 --> 56:05.380
You would probably occur to you that like,

56:05.380 --> 56:08.180
if we're gonna be doing cop things already,

56:08.180 --> 56:11.060
chasing perps, tracking down clues,

56:11.060 --> 56:12.420
hunting up the leads,

56:12.420 --> 56:14.820
if we're gonna be doing all this cop shit already, right?

56:14.820 --> 56:16.820
Let's do it to real crime.

56:16.820 --> 56:17.140
Yeah.

56:17.700 --> 56:18.420
Let's just do it.

56:18.420 --> 56:19.860
You're filming it already,

56:19.860 --> 56:21.700
and I already am gonna learn how to do it,

56:21.700 --> 56:23.620
cause I'm a consummate professional.

56:23.620 --> 56:26.020
Like let's just do the crime and bust them.

56:26.020 --> 56:27.540
Let's bust the perps.

56:27.540 --> 56:28.820
I don't see why not.

56:28.820 --> 56:29.700
I don't see why not.

56:30.660 --> 56:32.740
There's too much crime in this city.

56:32.740 --> 56:34.420
Let's just start busting it a little bit.

56:35.460 --> 56:36.580
That's just like on cops.

56:36.580 --> 56:38.180
I'm sure the inverse happened where they're like,

56:38.180 --> 56:39.380
this is supposed to be real.

56:39.380 --> 56:40.900
There are no crimes tonight.

56:40.900 --> 56:43.300
Can we all pretend to do a crime, please?

56:43.300 --> 56:44.740
Hey, can you call your cousin?

56:45.540 --> 56:47.700
They would just make a PA get like really drunk

56:47.700 --> 56:50.100
and take their pants off and walk down the street

56:50.100 --> 56:51.540
and then film them arresting him.

56:52.340 --> 56:56.900
I have a theory for a show that is real

56:56.900 --> 56:59.700
and I'm still formulating the logistics of it.

56:59.700 --> 57:01.460
Sounds like it's still percolating.

57:01.460 --> 57:02.740
It's still percolating,

57:02.740 --> 57:04.980
cause you can tell when I take pauses

57:04.980 --> 57:06.580
in my sentences like this,

57:06.580 --> 57:08.500
that's where I think my little thoughts

57:08.500 --> 57:09.780
to get it together.

57:09.780 --> 57:12.660
But I think the TV show that I know now,

57:12.660 --> 57:14.420
cause I finished the thought is real,

57:15.220 --> 57:16.020
is Dinosaurs.

57:18.020 --> 57:18.520
Okay.

57:18.520 --> 57:19.020
Okay.

57:19.880 --> 57:22.360
Cause here's a list of reasons.

57:22.360 --> 57:24.280
First of all, as far as I know,

57:24.280 --> 57:25.160
there's no actors.

57:27.880 --> 57:28.840
Only dinosaurs.

57:29.480 --> 57:31.320
Sure, found footage.

57:32.280 --> 57:33.720
The things that happened in Dinosaurs,

57:34.760 --> 57:35.880
we weren't there, right?

57:35.880 --> 57:38.040
Like people weren't there.

57:38.040 --> 57:40.120
So it could have been happening.

57:42.120 --> 57:44.920
And then at the end of the show,

57:44.920 --> 57:46.680
the ice age happens and that is,

57:46.680 --> 57:48.600
sorry guys, but read a history book.

57:48.600 --> 57:49.320
That's how it happened.

57:50.040 --> 57:51.080
They deleted it,

57:51.080 --> 57:53.640
but every episode on the original broadcast,

57:53.640 --> 57:54.280
if you remember,

57:54.920 --> 57:56.360
everyone used to begin

57:56.360 --> 57:58.600
with a very official looking scientist

57:58.600 --> 58:01.320
who said I have been setting dinosaur fossils

58:01.960 --> 58:03.080
for my entire life.

58:03.080 --> 58:04.520
And as near as I can tell,

58:05.240 --> 58:06.360
this is how it went.

58:07.800 --> 58:10.360
As near as I can put together from fossils,

58:10.360 --> 58:12.840
it will look something like this.

58:12.840 --> 58:14.600
Hi, I'm Neil deGrasse Tyson.

58:14.600 --> 58:14.920
No, see-

58:14.920 --> 58:16.920
I've put together all the information

58:16.920 --> 58:18.440
I could about Dinosaurs.

58:18.440 --> 58:19.480
Please do enjoy.

58:19.480 --> 58:21.160
If there was a character on Dinosaurs

58:21.800 --> 58:23.240
who is just like a caveman

58:23.240 --> 58:24.600
played by Greg Kinnear,

58:24.600 --> 58:25.320
I would see that and be like,

58:25.320 --> 58:26.840
well, this is bullshit.

58:26.840 --> 58:28.120
This is bullshit.

58:28.120 --> 58:29.320
That's just Greg Kinnear.

58:29.320 --> 58:30.440
And he's got a beard on,

58:31.000 --> 58:32.760
but he's just reading what they told him to say.

58:33.480 --> 58:34.600
Dinosaurs didn't have that.

58:34.600 --> 58:36.920
It was all just Dinosaurs without actors.

58:38.600 --> 58:39.640
So like without that,

58:40.520 --> 58:41.160
who knows?

58:41.960 --> 58:43.240
That's all I'm saying.

58:43.240 --> 58:46.040
Do you want to know a true- this is a shocking but true fact.

58:46.040 --> 58:46.680
Okay.

58:46.680 --> 58:48.520
Family Matters is, of course, not real.

58:48.520 --> 58:51.000
It's the many actors performing.

58:51.000 --> 58:52.040
No, that's Reginald Val Johnson.

58:52.040 --> 58:53.400
He was in the Die Hard movie.

58:53.400 --> 58:53.960
Exactly.

58:53.960 --> 58:55.240
But Griffin, did you know

58:55.880 --> 58:58.280
that what it is is a shot for shot remake

58:58.840 --> 59:01.800
of the Winslow family home videos.

59:02.840 --> 59:04.680
So while it's not the real footage,

59:04.680 --> 59:07.080
they just made a TV show based off of it,

59:07.080 --> 59:08.520
but it is shot for shot,

59:08.520 --> 59:10.040
line for line, exactly the same.

59:10.040 --> 59:11.560
Of the Winslow family.

59:11.560 --> 59:14.600
Yeah, but they just had actors portray the Winslow family.

59:15.240 --> 59:19.960
I just went to IMDb to search for dinosaurs

59:19.960 --> 59:21.320
to find the names of the dinosaurs

59:21.320 --> 59:23.000
that played them in Our Real Dinosaurs.

59:23.800 --> 59:26.120
And the lead story on IMDb is

59:26.120 --> 59:29.320
the Stranger Things cast in and out of costume.

59:29.320 --> 59:31.720
Hey, IMDb, that's disgusting.

59:33.080 --> 59:33.960
These are children.

59:36.120 --> 59:36.760
Let's wrap up.

59:36.760 --> 59:37.320
What do you think?

59:37.320 --> 59:40.520
Yeah, I'd love to do that.

59:40.520 --> 59:43.240
I really wanted to take some more time

59:43.240 --> 59:45.800
exploring Travis's theory that Family Matters

59:45.800 --> 59:48.280
is based on the home videos of a real family

59:48.280 --> 59:50.520
living in Chicago named the Winslows.

59:51.880 --> 59:54.760
We'll let the message words fill all that in, Griffin.

59:54.760 --> 59:55.800
Excuse me.

59:55.800 --> 59:57.720
Did you realize that the mom on Dinosaurs

59:57.720 --> 59:59.640
was played by Jessica Walter

59:59.640 --> 01:00:03.000
of fucking Arrested Development and Archer fame?

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:04.760
You just fucking ruined it for me then

01:00:04.760 --> 01:00:07.480
because she's not, wait, and what do you mean?

01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:09.800
And what do you mean she played the dinosaur?

01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:10.760
What I'm saying is that

01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:13.480
she's been a dinosaur this whole time.

01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:15.640
I don't, that's mean, I think, to say

01:00:15.640 --> 01:00:18.920
about she's absolutely perfect and wonderful.

01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:20.200
I don't think it's cool to say she's-

01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:21.880
She's been a human looking dinosaur

01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:23.960
I think that's actually kind of a busted thing to say.

01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:26.280
Maybe don't, maybe we shouldn't espouse that.

01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:27.820
What?

01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:30.360
Okay, so where did they go?

01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:32.200
That's a good question.

01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:35.480
Hmm, huh, guess I turned it around on you.

01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:37.960
Where did dinosaurs go?

01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:39.400
No, Justin, that's a great point.

01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:41.640
Where did the dinosaurs from Dinosaurs go?

01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:42.840
Where'd they go?

01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:45.560
Why aren't they doing more stuff?

01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:51.400
I saw Jurassic World and there's that one scene

01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:55.160
and you can just barely see fat dad dinosaur in the background

01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:56.360
and he's got his little briefcase.

01:00:56.360 --> 01:00:56.920
I love it.

01:00:58.600 --> 01:00:59.100
Flannel?

01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:00.840
Flannel dad, yeah.

01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:03.640
Yeah, I bet those dinosaurs every day

01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:05.480
like just cross their talons and hope

01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:08.200
for like a new Flintstones live action movie.

01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:10.600
I did see on BuzzFeed you won't believe

01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:13.480
what the baby from Dinosaurs looks like today

01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:15.960
and he had like the goatee and what all.

01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:17.720
Yeah, I remember that.

01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:22.440
The real shame was when Spikey had done dinosaur

01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:26.280
when he robbed that liquor store and he went to dino jail.

01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:28.520
Yeah, where I guess he is-

01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:31.000
He's out now, he's totally clean.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:31.160
Good.

01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:34.280
It's worth noting that that's what Travis calls museums.

01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:43.880
This has been our show, my brother and me.

01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:45.800
We hope you've enjoyed yourself and had a great time.

01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:48.680
This has been an hour of us pretending,

01:01:49.240 --> 01:01:51.320
just doing make believe television talk

01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:53.480
for literally 62 minutes.

01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:56.040
Hey, I've got a fun thing for you tomorrow.

01:01:56.040 --> 01:02:00.120
So if you are a owner of the PlayStation 4 console,

01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:02.280
we're in a video game.

01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:05.720
There's a game coming out on PSN tomorrow

01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:09.160
called 100 Foot Robot Golf.

01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:11.480
It is not just a VR game,

01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:13.000
although you can play with PlayStation VR

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:16.360
is also a regular ass PS4 game.

01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:18.200
And it's a golf game with giant robots

01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:21.000
and we're the commentators in the game.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:22.840
So if you wanna play golf,

01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:27.320
but you wanna have us saying somewhat related things

01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:29.000
to the golf action on the screen-

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:29.480
Sometimes.

01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:32.360
Then that would be the one that you should get.

01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:33.880
Not any others, that's the one.

01:02:34.760 --> 01:02:36.040
It's also really, really fun.

01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:38.360
I got to play a little demo version of it.

01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:40.280
Super fun, along with golf,

01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:42.680
your robot just like destroys a bunch of shit

01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:45.880
and has special moves and it's ridiculously fun.

01:02:45.880 --> 01:02:46.760
I love it very much.

01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:50.760
I wanna thank John Roderick and the Long Winters

01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:51.560
for the use of our theme song.

01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:53.800
Is it a partial off the album, Putting the Days to Bed?

01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:56.600
It's a really, really great song and a really good album.

01:02:56.600 --> 01:02:59.800
I've been putting together a Spotify playlist

01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:02.200
of like all the tunes I was bumping in college.

01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:04.120
I was feeling nostalgic for it.

01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:07.720
And just like, it's basically I just added

01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:10.040
three Long Winters albums to a Spotify playlist

01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:11.000
and that's about it.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:11.880
It's a really good band.

01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:14.120
I hope everybody's tried listening to it already.

01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:15.320
I also wanna thank Maximum Fun

01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:16.280
for having us on their network.

01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:17.480

01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:19.800
and go listen to a bunch of really great shows,

01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:22.440
stuff like Beef and Dairy Network and Throwing Shade

01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:25.400
and One Bad Mother, so many good shows,

01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:26.920

01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:30.120
we have a ton of other podcasts and YouTube series

01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:32.840
and you can find all of our contact info

01:03:32.840 --> 01:03:35.240
and all that stuff at mackroyshows.com.

01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:38.200
I wanna say thank you to everybody for listening.

01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:38.760
You know what I mean?

01:03:38.760 --> 01:03:41.000
Like we appreciate all of you and you're all great.

01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:43.720
And I wanna thank Christine Kelly

01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:45.160
who sent in this final Yahoo.

01:03:45.880 --> 01:03:46.600
Thank you, Christine.

01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:50.680
It's by Yahoo Answers user Cone who asks,

01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:53.160
can you please just admit

01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:55.160
that George Washington didn't exist?

01:03:58.200 --> 01:03:59.480
My name is Justin McElroy.

01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:00.600
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:01.560
I'm Griffin McElroy.

01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:03.080
My brother, my brother, me.

01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:17.880
Kiss your dad square on the lips.

01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:34.360
And woke.

01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:35.880
Or maybe you find yourself

01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:37.960
constantly explaining terms like these

01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:39.160
and you need a place to vent.

01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:42.760
Do you have a love for all things pop culture,

01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:45.000
social commentary, and politics?

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:48.120
Sounds like you need Minority Corner.

01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:50.280
Where you can learn, laugh, and play.

01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:51.560
Sounds like blues clues.

01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:54.920
Only it's more black, gay, and ladylike.

01:04:54.920 --> 01:04:56.920
James and Anika will happily administer

01:04:56.920 --> 01:04:58.600
your weekly dose each and every Friday.

01:04:58.600 --> 01:05:00.200
You can listen on Maximum Fun

01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:01.560
or wherever you get your podcasts.

01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:02.520
Minority Corner.

01:05:02.520 --> 01:05:03.320
With a K.

01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:33.240
Cause the C was taken.
