00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.640 --> 00:47.360
Hello, everybody. Welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me, an advice show for the modern

00:47.360 --> 00:51.360
era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

00:51.360 --> 00:56.240
I'm your baby brother, Griffin McElroy. Just flipping through the old My Brother,

00:56.240 --> 01:01.680
My Brother, and Me calendar, every week it's a new picture of Robert Loja every month.

01:01.680 --> 01:06.880
It's the world's only week-by-week calendar. It's more like a novel.

01:06.880 --> 01:13.360
This tells me nothing about our current chronological placement in the month or year,

01:13.360 --> 01:19.680
but it is Thursday. I know for sure as shit it's Thursday, though. Ask me what day it is.

01:19.680 --> 01:25.280
Right now, it's a picture of Robert Loja in a backpack, and he's giving a thumbs

01:25.280 --> 01:30.320
up, and he's on a skateboard, because that means it's back to school time here in America.

01:30.320 --> 01:33.840
Is he wearing a little propeller hat? Is he carrying a Pacific Rim lunchbox?

01:34.400 --> 01:45.760
He's got like a tassel cap that's like best of 99 or something, like a cap, like a tassel cap.

01:45.760 --> 01:50.000
Well, because just like when you go for a job interview, you should always dress for one step

01:50.000 --> 01:54.960
higher than you're going for, so just go ahead and dress like you're graduating college on your first

01:54.960 --> 02:01.760
day. That confuses a lot of people. Back-to-school time can always be intimidating if you're a teen,

02:02.960 --> 02:08.880
and we wanted to give you some advice, some unsolicited advice, about how to make the most

02:09.520 --> 02:15.040
of back-to-school time. I watched that documentary about going back to school,

02:16.160 --> 02:20.560
and like what colors to wear. It's called Orange is the New Black, and what I learned was don't

02:20.560 --> 02:26.480
insult the cafeteria food, or they'll feed you a bloody tampon. Trav, I thought like the over-under

02:26.480 --> 02:33.680
on you about to make a Rodney Dangerfield goof was like 90-10, and the fact that you bucked to

02:33.680 --> 02:39.200
those odds is like astonishing to me. Yeah, can I left field, you know what I mean? Here's what I'd

02:39.200 --> 02:47.360
like to say. No more games. What do you mean by that? Just when you go back to school this year,

02:47.360 --> 02:56.000
no more games. Do you mean like stop playing Pokemon? No, just like enough fooling around,

02:56.000 --> 03:01.440
you know. Oh, you want these high schoolers to just be more direct. No more drama. I'm not

03:01.440 --> 03:07.280
playing with you anymore. Teach. Give me my A. Right. Well, that's not how like education works.

03:07.280 --> 03:12.880
I'm not playing anymore. No more games. I'm tired of this back and forth where I give you a paper

03:12.880 --> 03:20.480
and put a number on it. Justin, you're describing though like the fundamental core of like what this

03:20.480 --> 03:26.080
facility is. It's not games as much as it is like the entirety of like what school is. Why does

03:26.080 --> 03:33.040
education have to be gamified? Why can't they just trust that you are learning and you trust that

03:33.040 --> 03:38.480
what they're saying makes sense and is true? I don't grade the teacher when I go in. I don't say

03:38.480 --> 03:43.840
like A+. I didn't fall asleep. I mean there are there are like surveys and like a standardized

03:43.840 --> 03:50.080
testing is kind of. Survey says. Okay, but that's not like a game show. But you just said no more

03:50.080 --> 03:56.160
games. So why would you want it? Well, Family Feud. Family Feud is that game is the sport.

03:56.880 --> 04:01.600
Yeah, it's a way of life. Hey, how about this year? And it's also cursed if you're the host.

04:01.600 --> 04:07.520
It's a cursed hosting job. I want to talk for a second about the hosts of Family Feud. Oh,

04:07.520 --> 04:15.040
good. Good, good, good. Now hang with me. Okay, because I if there's been a more diverse surfing

04:15.040 --> 04:23.520
IMDB with your host Justin McElroy. I know. Hey kids, come with me on the magic IMDB bus. No, I

04:24.960 --> 04:31.280
know this is all from the top of my head. Okay, Ray Combs, not funny, killed himself. Okay,

04:31.920 --> 04:36.480
we don't want to. Thanks for establishing the non-funny that he killed himself or that he was

04:36.480 --> 04:45.760
not funny. No, I mean, no, he is. It wasn't funny. Okay, so after Ray Combs died, the series went on

04:45.760 --> 04:50.160
hiatus for a while. Now, Justin, is that funny or not? Or is that something tragic? That's still not

04:50.160 --> 04:56.400
funny. Okay, here's the here's the the secession as the crowd has been passed. It has gone from

04:56.400 --> 05:04.160
Louie Anderson, the third King Louie Anderson, the third King Louie Anderson, who begat to Richard

05:04.160 --> 05:09.680
Karn. Oh, man. Are you guys going to the fucking carnival this year? Yeah, I got my tickets. I had

05:09.680 --> 05:15.920
to I had to I had to get them secondhand on eBay, but I think they're legitimate. They had the picture

05:16.640 --> 05:21.680
of his face on the ticket. So I think I think I'm going to be able to sneak my way into this

05:21.680 --> 05:27.520
this particular celebrity golf tournament. Jono Hurley. Perfect. You got anything with that? It's

05:27.520 --> 05:31.840
Jay Peterman on Seinfeld. I mean, I know who the fucking guy is. You don't have to give me his

05:31.840 --> 05:37.040
other credits. And then Steve Harvey and then Kevin Bacon. Six steps. Have you guys watched

05:37.040 --> 05:41.680
that fucking show since Harvey's been the host of it? It is. It has gotten rippled. It's like,

05:41.680 --> 05:46.000
what are your favorite Easter traditions? And then they'll turn to some like old grandma and

05:46.000 --> 05:50.560
she'll be like, Percy. And then he'll be like, I don't know. And I'll turn the board. And plus,

05:50.560 --> 05:56.240
it'd be like the top answer with 41 points. It's crazy how gross that show has gotten.

05:56.240 --> 06:06.240
They that show has discovered more terms for a human genitals and be the other terms for sexual

06:06.240 --> 06:12.560
activity. I'm going to have to call B.S. on this, Griffin, because according to a certain

06:12.560 --> 06:18.640
entertainment database, he is a devout Christian. So I don't think that is. Well, that's what I'm

06:18.640 --> 06:24.640
saying. It's it's like that. It's like the Patton Oswalt clean filth. It's like the grandma won't

06:24.640 --> 06:30.560
say pussy. She'll say like, not a hoo ha. And he'll be like, I don't know. And it'll be the

06:30.560 --> 06:35.280
top answer because people eat that shit up. Well, hold on, hold on, hold on.

06:37.120 --> 06:45.120
No, people eat up when there's an uncomfortable like over hyper sexualization of family feud.

06:45.120 --> 06:48.640
That was those were always the episodes that people like talked about. And so Steve Harvey

06:49.200 --> 06:53.920
hatched a sinister plan where he's like, let's get that shit in every episode or

06:53.920 --> 06:59.600
start with episode. I would be more likely to watch family feud if the people they surveyed

06:59.600 --> 07:06.800
what it was all like 12 to 14 year old middle school boys. And so it's just like a top answer

07:06.800 --> 07:15.600
is farts. How do you show your family your love for 27 weeks running? Top answer is farts. Still,

07:16.240 --> 07:20.320
let's actually help a real person. No one was here about me. I think we're providing a very

07:20.320 --> 07:25.120
valuable service to Steve Harvey right now. Steve Harvey, clean up your act. Steve Harvey,

07:25.120 --> 07:32.000
you have the 2497th star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Get it together. You know, I was walking

07:32.000 --> 07:37.360
into my apartment and I heard a girl exclaim shit. She had dropped some groceries. She was unloading

07:37.360 --> 07:42.640
from her car and appeared to be having a hard time carrying everything into the next building over.

07:42.640 --> 07:47.120
I thought about offering to help, but I didn't want to look like a creeper to follow her into

07:47.120 --> 07:51.120
her apartment. But then I felt like a bad neighbor for not helping with a simple task.

07:51.760 --> 07:56.800
Is it possible for a dude to offer a woman help without looking like he's hitting on her?

07:56.800 --> 08:02.320
What should I do in this situation? I'm a man in his late 20s. She appeared a little younger

08:02.320 --> 08:06.720
and was pretty cute. And our neighborhood is okay, but a little sketchy after dark.

08:09.520 --> 08:14.800
You would have been fine. You would have been fine had it not been for that parenthetical.

08:14.800 --> 08:20.720
Yeah. You had to put it in there, didn't you? No, no, no. It's totally cool. I just want to help.

08:20.720 --> 08:26.720
I don't want to look like I'm hitting on her. I mean, she was pretty cute. No. Do you see why

08:26.720 --> 08:32.400
they think this of us? Here's the problem. Do you see? Because it's easy. How to do it without

08:32.400 --> 08:37.120
appearing like you're hitting on her. Don't hit on her. Yeah. But can you trust yourself? Can you

08:37.120 --> 08:41.600
trust? Because it sounds like you have some tendencies. It sounds like you don't trust

08:41.600 --> 08:45.600
yourself. You're going to be like, oh, don't worry. I got that. By the way, nice ass.

08:47.200 --> 08:54.800
I don't think that. Sweet melons. What? I didn't buy melons. No. Talk about sweet melons.

08:58.400 --> 09:05.440
It's a grocery joke. I got a lot of them. I also got a huge cucumber here.

09:07.680 --> 09:10.560
I did actually buy a huge cucumber. Yeah. No, I have it. I have the cucumber.

09:10.560 --> 09:17.280
I have it in my, I'm saying, do you want me to, do you want me to put it somewhere like

09:17.280 --> 09:25.440
on my kitchen counter? I guess it's, I have like a hanging basket. And then it could get uncomfortable.

09:25.440 --> 09:33.200
I have 10 wieners. Wait a minute. How do you? But only eight buns. Why do they do that? You ever

09:33.200 --> 09:40.160
noticed? But I only bought a package of nine hot dogs at the store that sells things in packages

09:40.160 --> 09:46.800
of nine. I think the thing you have to ask yourself is would you have felt the same inclination to help

09:46.800 --> 09:51.680
had it been like a dude in a similar circumstance? Definitely not. Well, the thing is you wouldn't

09:51.680 --> 09:56.400
have hesitated to help. I mean, I think that's, what's unfortunate is, you know,

09:58.320 --> 10:03.760
if you don't want to look, I think the reason that you are worried that you're going to look

10:03.760 --> 10:10.320
like you're hitting on this woman is that you were, I mean, you were. No, no, no. Here's the

10:10.320 --> 10:14.640
thing though. I can see it from his point of view though, that where the fear would be

10:16.160 --> 10:19.600
in that instant where you got to make that decision of like, do I say something or just

10:19.600 --> 10:25.280
keep walking into my building? Like in this day and age, sometimes I, you know, I completely get

10:25.280 --> 10:28.400
that like, no, if I say anything, it's gonna be a creeper. And then you get inside and go,

10:28.400 --> 10:32.880
why didn't I just like say, oh, I'll help you with that. Like be a good dude. You know what I mean?

10:32.880 --> 10:40.640
So like, I completely get the fear and I get the worry, even if there was no planned flirting,

10:40.640 --> 10:43.360
or it was like, oh, hey, she's pretty cute. I'm going to go help her with her groceries.

10:43.360 --> 10:48.560
When you size out a situation, when you size it up and you check out the scene

10:48.560 --> 10:54.000
before making a decision and acting upon it, I don't, I don't, I think it's unrealistic for us

10:54.000 --> 11:00.640
to say you shouldn't scope, scope out the other person's physicality for lack of a better word.

11:00.640 --> 11:02.080
Mm-hmm.

11:02.080 --> 11:06.000
I think, I think that's just human nature. I think you, I think you see,

11:07.840 --> 11:14.640
I think you, I think it's coded into men's DNA that like you see a lady, you know, you know,

11:14.640 --> 11:19.120
have two arms full and having trouble opening a door and you go to open that door and on the way

11:19.120 --> 11:24.160
you fully scope it, like you fully scope it out and not in like a creepy way, man, I'm really

11:24.160 --> 11:26.480
digging my trouble hole right now. It's like you're trying to overcome biology way.

11:26.480 --> 11:27.120
Right.

11:27.120 --> 11:28.960
Like you're assessing the situation.

11:28.960 --> 11:35.280
He's got eyes is what I'm saying. He's got eyes and he sees the, he sees all the things and it's-

11:35.280 --> 11:38.640
This is what, what you're pointing out is just that guys are the pits.

11:38.640 --> 11:40.160
Guys are definitely the worst.

11:40.160 --> 11:44.240
Everybody, but here's the thing. Here's the thing. It's not like he's a fucking scientist.

11:44.240 --> 11:49.040
He can't objectively look at her face and body and be like, yes, I will help her. You know what

11:49.040 --> 11:53.520
I mean? So he's, so even if he recognizes that she's cute, I don't think that should stop him-

11:53.520 --> 11:55.680
Why didn't he include it in his question?

11:55.680 --> 12:01.920
Is, is, are we to believe that if she was less attractive, he would swoop in there and be her

12:01.920 --> 12:06.800
valiant white knight? Cause he'd be like, don't, I'm not trying to get any play.

12:06.800 --> 12:10.960
I think he included it in the question because he has an assumption that because she's cute,

12:11.760 --> 12:16.000
she probably gets a lot more attention and expects that it's a hit.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.640
Or maybe because he's trying to have a cute meet.

12:19.600 --> 12:24.240
This is the, like you have an opportunity. I think you had an opportunity.

12:24.240 --> 12:26.080
Oh, you blew it and you'll never have it again forever.

12:26.080 --> 12:28.240
You blew it and you'll never have it again, but you had an opportunity.

12:28.240 --> 12:31.440
No, now when he sees her, he just has to say, hey, I saw you the other day with

12:31.440 --> 12:34.720
the groceries and if you ever buy too many groceries again, just let me know and I'll help

12:34.720 --> 12:37.760
you. Hey, I was going to help you with your groceries, but you were too pretty to help you.

12:39.120 --> 12:41.360
If you buy too many oranges again, I'll help you.

12:41.360 --> 12:44.640
Buy too many oranges next week and maybe I won't be scared this time.

12:44.640 --> 12:48.160
I'm going to be home about 5 30 if you don't buy too many oranges then.

12:48.160 --> 12:50.800
Let me know next time you're planning on dropping a bunch of shit.

12:50.800 --> 12:56.160
You had a great opportunity to go into the situation, help this woman and then leave.

12:56.880 --> 13:05.440
And like reaffirm her fate, like start to rebuild this terrible debt of horribleness that we,

13:05.440 --> 13:09.760
the male half of the species have built up over millennia.

13:09.760 --> 13:13.360
Like you could start paying back that life debt that we have by just like

13:13.360 --> 13:17.680
being nice and not hitting on somebody and just like helping them and then leaving.

13:17.680 --> 13:21.360
Especially if you look at it from the other way that if like she saw you looking and you

13:21.360 --> 13:24.240
didn't go over to help, she's like, God fucking dick.

13:24.240 --> 13:25.600
He's already had too much shit.

13:26.800 --> 13:29.120
Barbara, you have to leave this fucking city.

13:29.120 --> 13:31.040
I am. I hate the city.

13:31.040 --> 13:35.200
It's either dudes are hitting on you or they're not helping you with your too many oranges.

13:35.200 --> 13:36.800
I bet that's how he gets off.

13:36.800 --> 13:41.680
How he just holds it over your head that you can't hold six gallons of milk at one time.

13:41.680 --> 13:43.360
Also, you need to stop drinking so much.

13:45.200 --> 13:46.480
You can't walk anymore.

13:46.480 --> 13:50.800
She would have been flabbergasted if he had swooped in and been like,

13:50.800 --> 13:52.000
oh yeah, yeah, yeah, let me help you with that.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
And then helped her with that and was like, all right, I'm taking off.

13:54.000 --> 13:54.500
Bye.

13:55.440 --> 13:57.120
Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying.

13:57.120 --> 13:58.240
Was that Batman?

14:02.000 --> 14:06.800
By just being a decent human being, you can like completely rewrite someone's day.

14:06.800 --> 14:10.560
Maybe that was my grandson from the future come back to save my life.

14:10.560 --> 14:17.680
That's the only rational explanation is that he's a time traveler.

14:17.680 --> 14:20.080
Nope, there's nowhere else for that to go.

14:20.080 --> 14:20.800
Do you guys want to Yahoo?

14:24.560 --> 14:27.120
This Yahoo was sent in by Dale Roerbog.

14:30.000 --> 14:30.800
Thank you, Dale.

14:30.800 --> 14:33.280
It's by Yahoo Answers user Ting Ting who asks,

14:34.720 --> 14:36.080
and I'm sorry if this is too weird.

14:37.680 --> 14:39.680
Do you smell a person while hugging?

14:39.680 --> 14:41.680
Be true.

14:43.680 --> 14:45.600
He adds, definitely yes.

14:45.600 --> 14:49.280
It gives you a kind of an idea of what kind of a person he or she is.

14:52.000 --> 14:52.880
Does it?

14:52.880 --> 14:55.520
I'm trying to think if I've ever like intentionally.

14:56.080 --> 14:57.840
Yeah, because that's the thing.

14:57.840 --> 15:01.600
You mean like, oh, I hug someone and you know, like I'm breathing.

15:01.600 --> 15:02.400
Yeah, that's the thing.

15:02.400 --> 15:03.200
I hug someone and go.

15:03.840 --> 15:09.120
It's like when you scope it out, when you scope out a situation and you see it with your eyes,

15:09.120 --> 15:12.160
like the neurons are already in your brain.

15:12.160 --> 15:15.280
Once you perceive the thing, the neurons are going to go where they want to go.

15:15.280 --> 15:17.920
They're going to fire off the synapses that they want to fire off.

15:17.920 --> 15:20.320
And then all of a sudden, you know, if that person's attractive or not.

15:20.320 --> 15:26.720
When you hug someone, you have smell particles going in your nose that are firing off those.

15:26.720 --> 15:28.720
Your eyes can be deceived, Griffin.

15:28.720 --> 15:29.680
Right, that's true.

15:29.680 --> 15:31.760
But smell particles can't lie.

15:31.760 --> 15:35.760
I actually have, I think that my usual MO is to,

15:35.760 --> 15:42.240
like I'll do a regular inhale, like as I'm going in for the hug, just breathing.

15:42.240 --> 15:42.640
Oh, man.

15:42.640 --> 15:45.360
But then if I like, sort of, I like.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.760
Oh, you'll go in for secondsies.

15:47.760 --> 15:48.320
I'll go.

15:48.320 --> 15:49.200
You'll take a second.

15:49.200 --> 15:50.640
Hey, do you mind if I take a second scoop?

15:51.600 --> 15:52.080
Just real quick.

15:52.080 --> 15:53.440
Let me just get a second scoop real quick.

15:53.440 --> 15:55.120
Is this one per customer or can I have two?

15:55.120 --> 15:56.640
Can I have, how much for an extra shot?

15:57.760 --> 16:02.640
I feel like if you get an extra whiff in though, you definitely do have to comment.

16:02.640 --> 16:04.320
Oh, man, definitely.

16:04.320 --> 16:07.200
You just have to say like, okay, can I hug the other shoulder now?

16:07.200 --> 16:08.400
And then you go to the right.

16:08.400 --> 16:09.840
Yeah, like the French do it.

16:09.840 --> 16:11.440
The French do it, double hugs.

16:11.440 --> 16:17.680
This is a serious, serious problem for men of my sinucistic,

16:19.600 --> 16:27.120
who have my particular almost constant set of maladies relating to my nose zone.

16:28.160 --> 16:32.640
Which is to say, it's some kind of, it's either hay fever season or mold season

16:32.640 --> 16:34.720
or some kind of season constantly here in Austin.

16:34.720 --> 16:36.080
So I'm constantly sniffling.

16:36.800 --> 16:42.160
And if I'm hugging someone, I mean, every 10 seconds I have to sniff.

16:42.160 --> 16:46.400
And if they land in that period, it is going to seem like I'm like,

16:46.400 --> 16:47.200
oh, hey, bring it in.

16:47.200 --> 16:48.080
Yeah, I haven't seen you in a while.

16:53.600 --> 16:53.920
What?

16:53.920 --> 16:57.760
No, it's just, yeah, I'm sick.

16:57.760 --> 17:00.000
Well, then why don't you just embrace it and be like, you smell great.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.640
Just say you smell great, everybody wants to hear that.

17:02.640 --> 17:04.400
You brighten somebody's day, they don't think it's weird.

17:04.400 --> 17:05.760
Or you've been working out.

17:07.040 --> 17:07.920
A compliment.

17:07.920 --> 17:10.560
It's a great compliment when not said right after sniffing.

17:10.560 --> 17:15.600
Because when somebody's fit, the scent that they produce is way,

17:15.600 --> 17:16.960
way, way better when they've just-

17:16.960 --> 17:20.240
Oh no, I meant that they were working out immediately prior to the hug.

17:20.240 --> 17:21.440
Oh God.

17:21.440 --> 17:22.640
So they smell like Jim Funk.

17:23.600 --> 17:25.280
Also, have you guys met my friend, Jim Funk?

17:26.240 --> 17:28.960
I want to ask you guys, this is related,

17:28.960 --> 17:31.200
and it's something that's been on my mind for a few days.

17:31.840 --> 17:34.880
I was watching something on TV, I don't know.

17:34.880 --> 17:36.160
But you see it all the time.

17:36.720 --> 17:37.840
And two people were meeting-

17:37.840 --> 17:38.400
The TV show?

17:38.400 --> 17:40.560
Yeah, a television program.

17:41.200 --> 17:44.720
A few people were meeting, and when they were greeting each other,

17:44.720 --> 17:50.480
the guy goes in and kisses the woman's cheek as like a greeting, right?

17:51.840 --> 17:53.040
And you see this happen-

17:53.040 --> 17:54.560
Was it his wife or his mom?

17:55.280 --> 17:55.760
No.

17:55.760 --> 17:56.240
Okay, well then-

17:56.240 --> 17:58.720
But you see people doing, I mean, it happens.

17:58.720 --> 17:59.440
People do it.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.760
I don't know.

18:01.760 --> 18:04.000
I mean, grownups are always doing this,

18:04.000 --> 18:06.560
and I see it on television and sometimes in real life,

18:06.560 --> 18:15.680
and I don't know how you would even begin to add that layer to your social repertoire.

18:15.680 --> 18:17.920
Yeah, because I honestly, I've tried it.

18:17.920 --> 18:23.040
Like, I've done a couple of, you know, just preliminary tries of the cheek kiss reading.

18:23.840 --> 18:25.920
Just to kind of take it for a spin and see how it goes.

18:25.920 --> 18:26.400
Hey, listen, I don't-

18:26.400 --> 18:27.920
I gotta hear about your dry runs.

18:27.920 --> 18:31.040
I don't want to weird you out, but do you want to experiment with me?

18:32.480 --> 18:33.520
I want to try something out.

18:33.520 --> 18:35.280
It's like, okay, so you know that awkward moment

18:35.280 --> 18:37.840
when like someone goes for a hug and you go for a handshake?

18:38.560 --> 18:38.800
Yeah.

18:38.800 --> 18:41.440
It's like that times like eight, because it's like-

18:41.440 --> 18:42.320
Just eight?

18:42.320 --> 18:43.840
That seems so conservative.

18:44.480 --> 18:48.080
Griffin, I've done a lot of number crunching on this.

18:48.080 --> 18:48.800
It's eight.

18:48.800 --> 18:50.000
Because the person pulled back-

18:50.000 --> 18:52.800
The chances that someone's gonna fucking headbutt you is pretty high.

18:52.800 --> 18:54.080
The person pulled back and was like,

18:54.080 --> 18:57.840
that was eight times weirder than when you go for a hug and they go for a handshake.

18:57.840 --> 18:59.680
That was exactly 800% weirder.

18:59.680 --> 19:01.760
Griffin, I took fucking statistics in college.

19:01.760 --> 19:03.440
And I do, in fact, know what I'm talking about.

19:03.440 --> 19:05.600
I've got a survey size of a thousand.

19:06.560 --> 19:07.120
And it was based across the board.

19:07.120 --> 19:08.880
Well, you told us it was two.

19:08.880 --> 19:10.080
What? No, I said a couple.

19:10.080 --> 19:12.640
That could be a thousand.

19:12.640 --> 19:13.120
How did you-

19:13.120 --> 19:13.600
Could have been a thousand.

19:13.600 --> 19:14.320
How did you-

19:14.320 --> 19:14.820
What-

19:15.360 --> 19:16.400
Were you-

19:16.400 --> 19:17.360
Had you been drinking?

19:17.360 --> 19:18.000
Like, what?

19:18.000 --> 19:18.640
I don't know what-

19:18.640 --> 19:20.480
Yeah, I can't even imagine making this decision.

19:20.480 --> 19:21.840
No, that's a horrible experiment.

19:21.840 --> 19:25.040
I did it in laboratory conditions.

19:25.040 --> 19:26.560
Did you do one dude, one lady?

19:27.280 --> 19:28.800
Just to see how it felt, like-

19:28.800 --> 19:30.800
I did 500 dudes and 500 dudes.

19:32.080 --> 19:33.920
And it was mostly for college credit,

19:33.920 --> 19:35.680
because I can't afford to pay that many people.

19:36.240 --> 19:36.740
Sure.

19:37.840 --> 19:38.340
Sure.

19:40.480 --> 19:43.440
Your fucking mouth would have been busted after a thousand smooches.

19:43.440 --> 19:44.320
I had a robot.

19:45.360 --> 19:46.640
I didn't do it myself.

19:46.640 --> 19:47.140
Right.

19:47.920 --> 19:50.880
Pretend this robot is a loved one you haven't seen in a long time.

19:50.880 --> 19:52.880
Your acquaintances, but not lovers.

19:52.880 --> 19:54.400
Okay, now the scene is set.

19:54.400 --> 19:56.160
How many times worse was that?

19:56.160 --> 19:57.760
Enter the smooching chamber.

19:58.320 --> 19:59.440
The background is set.

20:00.080 --> 20:01.440
Enter the smoochitorium.

20:03.040 --> 20:04.720
Well, you don't want to skew the results,

20:04.720 --> 20:06.400
so I had to tell them they were there for a sleep study.

20:06.400 --> 20:10.320
Something is going to happen in this room with this stranger robot

20:10.320 --> 20:11.760
that's going to make you uncomfortable.

20:11.760 --> 20:12.880
Have fun, science.

20:15.600 --> 20:17.280
Get your college credit on the way out.

20:17.280 --> 20:18.320
It's important that they don't know

20:18.320 --> 20:21.440
that the robot is part of the experiment, though,

20:21.440 --> 20:25.120
or else it'll ruin the truth of the experiment.

20:25.120 --> 20:25.520
Which is?

20:25.520 --> 20:28.000
If you ever see a robot, it better be a part of an experiment.

20:28.000 --> 20:28.500
Yeah.

20:30.640 --> 20:31.360
I just can't.

20:32.400 --> 20:33.440
Honestly, I can't.

20:34.240 --> 20:35.040
I cannot imagine.

20:35.040 --> 20:37.840
I mean, adults seem to do it so smoothly.

20:37.840 --> 20:39.120
Like, when it happens, it's like-

20:39.120 --> 20:41.840
Okay, first, can I just say, you gotta stop saying adults.

20:41.840 --> 20:43.040
It's grown-ups.

20:43.040 --> 20:44.640
Grown-ups are the only ones who do it.

20:44.640 --> 20:45.600
Grown folks do it.

20:46.560 --> 20:47.520
I see adults do it.

20:47.520 --> 20:48.640
Like, grown-up people do it.

20:48.640 --> 20:50.000
I don't know how they get-

20:50.000 --> 20:51.360
I just- I don't-

20:51.360 --> 20:54.400
Because the weirdest thing about it for me is that,

20:54.400 --> 21:00.640
whenever it happens, the recipient never seems to be surprised.

21:00.640 --> 21:04.000
So, in their mind, they had already met this person

21:04.000 --> 21:05.840
in the social contract, like, halfway there.

21:05.840 --> 21:09.200
Like, well, I'm expecting this person might kiss me on the cheek.

21:09.200 --> 21:12.880
Have I- have there been people in my life that I have greeted

21:12.880 --> 21:16.800
that were fully expecting a cheek kiss that did not receive one?

21:16.800 --> 21:18.560
Just because it's not part of my repertoire.

21:18.560 --> 21:22.000
No, I think it's like saying, I love you, where it's like,

21:22.000 --> 21:25.760
until you do it the first time, it's never expected.

21:26.320 --> 21:29.280
And then, once you do it, it's like, why didn't you say, I love you?

21:29.280 --> 21:30.960
That probably has something to do with it.

21:30.960 --> 21:34.560
And my theory, and I don't want to sound xenophobic,

21:35.920 --> 21:38.400
which I do in, like, almost every episode anyway,

21:39.520 --> 21:44.320
but I think that the friends that bring that element into your group of friends,

21:44.320 --> 21:48.960
I think we can probably safely label that element,

21:48.960 --> 21:52.400
that type of person, as people who have studied abroad.

21:53.360 --> 21:58.320
I think that they bring that social norm back into your group of friends,

21:58.320 --> 22:03.120
and then it sort of, it spreads like a virus throughout the culture.

22:03.120 --> 22:04.000
Mm-hmm.

22:04.000 --> 22:04.160
And then-

22:04.160 --> 22:05.040
That would make sense.

22:05.040 --> 22:07.520
It has to be sort of, like, in small do-

22:07.520 --> 22:11.760
Like, this is not something that has stratified

22:11.760 --> 22:14.400
throughout our entire cultural landscape in America.

22:14.400 --> 22:17.440
There are pockets of it where it has spread.

22:17.440 --> 22:21.360
I have been party to groups of friends throughout my travels

22:23.840 --> 22:28.560
who, like, just don't physically touch each other at all.

22:28.560 --> 22:35.040
Like, they don't hug or anything when we would get together and hang out.

22:35.040 --> 22:38.560
And then, all of a sudden, one new person would be added to the group.

22:38.560 --> 22:43.440
We'll call him Huggin' Dan, and Huggin' Dan would start hugging people.

22:43.440 --> 22:45.200
And then, all of a sudden, the people in that group are like,

22:45.200 --> 22:46.640
hey, hugs are pretty cool.

22:46.640 --> 22:48.000
It's cool to hug a friend.

22:48.000 --> 22:48.400
And then-

22:48.400 --> 22:50.480
It's nice to connect with another human being.

22:50.480 --> 22:52.400
With, like, a lot of your body all at the same time.

22:52.400 --> 22:54.160
And then, all of a sudden, it's a hugging group of friends.

22:55.600 --> 22:57.440
I think that's what happens with the cheek kiss,

22:57.440 --> 23:02.320
except the person who does it is, like, way, way bolder than a Huggin' Dan.

23:02.320 --> 23:03.920
They're a smooch and Steve.

23:03.920 --> 23:05.600
If you want to become a smooch and Steve,

23:05.600 --> 23:07.760
it's very important that you make eye contact first

23:07.760 --> 23:09.840
and maybe put your hands on their shoulders

23:09.840 --> 23:11.760
to, like, establish, like, this is happening.

23:11.760 --> 23:13.440
And then, wait 30 seconds.

23:13.440 --> 23:15.680
If they don't move, they're into it.

23:15.680 --> 23:17.200
It's just, it's just-

23:17.200 --> 23:20.560
You gotta wait till you feel an opening in their kinetic energy

23:20.560 --> 23:21.840
and then you're invited in.

23:21.840 --> 23:24.400
The fucking complications that it adds.

23:24.400 --> 23:24.720
That's the thing.

23:24.720 --> 23:27.040
Because, like, when we do, like,

23:28.000 --> 23:30.080
when someone new is hanging out with our group,

23:30.080 --> 23:31.520
our Huggin' group of friends,

23:31.520 --> 23:34.480
I have that moment where, like, we hang out with them all day

23:34.480 --> 23:35.440
and, like, I get to know them.

23:35.440 --> 23:39.120
I'm like, you are a tight bro and we are going to be bros for a long time.

23:39.120 --> 23:41.360
I can just tell it in this connection.

23:41.360 --> 23:43.040
But we've only known each other for one day.

23:43.040 --> 23:44.320
Do I hug you when you leave?

23:44.880 --> 23:45.680
Here's how you do it.

23:45.680 --> 23:46.880
Ah, this is how you figure-

23:46.880 --> 23:48.560
This I've got an answer for.

23:48.560 --> 23:51.040
You have to hug somebody else that you're already hugging friends with.

23:51.040 --> 23:51.680
Yeah, and then he sees it.

23:51.680 --> 23:53.840
And then look at this dude and you go,

23:53.840 --> 23:54.720
fuck it, come here.

23:54.720 --> 23:56.160
Okay, yes, that's true.

23:56.160 --> 23:58.960
It's choppy waters, but they're navigable.

23:58.960 --> 24:00.640
When kisses are up in the mix?

24:01.600 --> 24:04.800
Then you gotta have one partner in crime that's like,

24:04.800 --> 24:06.480
listen, I'm going to kiss your cheek

24:06.480 --> 24:08.960
and then I'm going to fucking instigate it around

24:08.960 --> 24:10.560
and people will see us do it and be like,

24:10.560 --> 24:11.200
oh, that's not weird.

24:11.200 --> 24:11.600
They did it.

24:11.600 --> 24:14.400
I just don't understand where you're at in your life

24:14.400 --> 24:17.440
when that risk-reward balances out.

24:18.640 --> 24:24.160
I'm so good at socializing that I'm going to challenge my game.

24:24.160 --> 24:27.840
I'm going to bump it up and make it harder for myself

24:27.840 --> 24:29.840
because it's just too easy right now.

24:29.840 --> 24:32.800
When you say risk, you mean the chance that maybe

24:32.800 --> 24:35.120
they might choose that moment to go in for a cheek kiss

24:35.120 --> 24:35.600
for you.

24:35.600 --> 24:36.160
And then you kiss him.

24:36.160 --> 24:39.200
Travis, when I say risk, I mean literally

24:39.200 --> 24:43.120
any mouth-related catastrophe that has ever occurred

24:43.120 --> 24:44.240
to anybody in your life.

24:44.240 --> 24:45.760
How do I end up on their ear?

24:45.760 --> 24:46.960
What do I do now?

24:46.960 --> 24:48.160
I'm nibbling.

24:48.160 --> 24:49.600
I'm nibbling gently.

24:49.600 --> 24:51.120
What am I doing?

24:51.120 --> 24:52.880
My tongue's in their eye.

24:52.880 --> 24:54.720
I had a stroke midway through

24:54.720 --> 24:57.680
and now my mouth is on their nose forever.

24:57.680 --> 25:01.440
Let's also acknowledge the fact that, Travis,

25:01.440 --> 25:02.960
in two months you're going to be a married man

25:02.960 --> 25:04.480
and four I'll be a married man.

25:04.480 --> 25:07.280
Justin, you've been a married man for like 50 years.

25:09.280 --> 25:11.760
We can't get into adultery like now.

25:12.800 --> 25:15.600
We can't get into adultery because that is what that is.

25:16.160 --> 25:18.000
Your mouth touches another person's flesh.

25:19.120 --> 25:20.640
That is sin in the eyes of the Lord.

25:21.840 --> 25:23.200
I am not trying to fuck with that.

25:24.480 --> 25:26.240
Guys, I'm a 20-year-old furry.

25:28.160 --> 25:30.560
The squeaky clean charity doing kind.

25:30.560 --> 25:32.240
Who's planning to buy a fursuit

25:32.240 --> 25:35.360
to go to fur meets and charity events in.

25:35.360 --> 25:37.120
Okay, Furries, I just want to interrupt real quick

25:37.120 --> 25:38.400
and ask the question.

25:38.400 --> 25:40.720
Is this a real thing where in the furry community

25:40.720 --> 25:42.960
you just put fur before everything?

25:42.960 --> 25:44.960
Or is this gentleman just doing it?

25:44.960 --> 25:48.080
Furries, I think we've made ourselves pretty clear

25:48.080 --> 25:49.600
that we're supporters of your lifestyle

25:50.400 --> 25:51.440
and your whole thing.

25:51.440 --> 25:52.480
We're into it.

25:52.480 --> 25:56.160
I don't think you need to clarify

25:56.160 --> 25:58.400
that everything you do is fur related.

25:58.400 --> 25:59.600
Like if I'm going to-

25:59.600 --> 26:03.280
And I might have some fur drinks at the fur bar.

26:03.280 --> 26:06.160
Yeah, I don't go to like a tuxedo party.

26:06.160 --> 26:08.000
I just go to like a ball.

26:10.160 --> 26:12.240
I don't buy a clothesuit.

26:12.240 --> 26:13.760
I just buy a suit.

26:13.760 --> 26:14.720
Anyway, let's move on.

26:15.440 --> 26:18.560
Fursuit, I think is actually a valuable qualifier.

26:18.560 --> 26:20.160
I will grant you fursuit.

26:20.160 --> 26:22.000
Okay, that's important information.

26:22.880 --> 26:26.640
Anyway, I have wanted one since I joined the fandom

26:26.640 --> 26:28.080
and I'm now able to purchase one

26:28.080 --> 26:31.840
working 24 hours a week in 90 degree weather at Home Depot.

26:31.840 --> 26:32.340
Jesus.

26:33.440 --> 26:35.520
The suit will cost $2,300.

26:35.520 --> 26:36.480
What the fuck?

26:39.760 --> 26:41.040
This person's working a lot.

26:41.040 --> 26:41.920
Give him a break.

26:41.920 --> 26:45.920
I know though, I guess great that you have $2,300

26:45.920 --> 26:48.320
but that's a fucking moped.

26:48.320 --> 26:49.680
That's like all kinds of that.

26:50.800 --> 26:52.720
Why is a fursuit that expensive?

26:52.720 --> 26:55.520
Because it's made by a world famous maker.

26:55.520 --> 26:56.720
Oh, okay.

26:56.720 --> 26:58.000
I should have let you finish the sentence.

26:58.000 --> 26:58.960
Go ahead and finish the sentence.

26:58.960 --> 26:59.440
Thanks.

26:59.440 --> 27:00.560
I'm a 20 year old furry.

27:00.560 --> 27:04.880
The suit will cost $2,300 and is made by a world famous maker.

27:04.880 --> 27:07.040
My parents, however, hate my plan.

27:07.040 --> 27:09.920
They tell me wanting the suit is stupid and a waste of money.

27:10.560 --> 27:14.080
Please note that my brother who is a year younger than I am

27:14.080 --> 27:15.920
is allowed to buy expensive cigars

27:15.920 --> 27:18.160
even though my grandmother recently died from lung cancer

27:18.160 --> 27:19.440
caused by secondhand smoke.

27:21.520 --> 27:24.240
Should I really listen to my parents or ignore them

27:24.240 --> 27:29.200
and achieve my long sought after prize fursuit funk?

27:29.200 --> 27:29.920
Okay.

27:29.920 --> 27:31.440
I'm just gonna throw this out to you

27:31.440 --> 27:33.600
that that's a missed opportunity in the name there

27:33.600 --> 27:35.520
because it should be fursuit of happiness.

27:35.520 --> 27:36.000
That's great.

27:38.720 --> 27:40.080
So I have a lot of questions

27:40.080 --> 27:43.040
and total understanding, total acceptance, no judgment.

27:43.040 --> 27:48.080
We are open doors policy here at the Brother Institute.

27:50.480 --> 27:51.680
I did not know.

27:51.680 --> 27:57.360
And again, this is a learning journey I'm on

27:57.360 --> 27:58.480
with the furry community.

28:00.560 --> 28:02.800
I did not know that there was such a thing

28:02.800 --> 28:05.600
as a world famous maker of furry suits.

28:05.600 --> 28:08.640
I'm imagining like a Donatella Versace only.

28:08.640 --> 28:09.840
Or this designer.

28:09.840 --> 28:11.840
I think you mean Donatella Fursace.

28:12.480 --> 28:13.040
Fuck me.

28:13.600 --> 28:19.440
I'm saying that I would resubscribe to any cable plan

28:19.440 --> 28:22.240
that any cable company wanted me to be on

28:22.240 --> 28:24.800
in order to watch Furry Project Runway.

28:25.440 --> 28:27.360
Can I say yes to the fur dress?

28:27.360 --> 28:31.200
Any show about furries at all I would watch in a heartbeat.

28:31.200 --> 28:32.800
I'm not talking about like true life.

28:32.800 --> 28:34.880
I want to see one that celebrates a lifestyle.

28:34.880 --> 28:36.720
Yeah, I don't want it like gypsy wedding show.

28:36.720 --> 28:39.040
I want it to be like, look how fucking awesome

28:39.040 --> 28:40.560
and dope these people are.

28:40.560 --> 28:43.600
Much more confident these people are in their life than you.

28:43.600 --> 28:44.480
And what do you do?

28:44.480 --> 28:44.880
That's so great.

28:44.880 --> 28:45.840
What do you do?

28:45.840 --> 28:47.840
You get nervous if your shorts don't match.

28:47.840 --> 28:49.440
That guy's dressed like a badger.

28:49.440 --> 28:50.400
Fuck you.

28:50.400 --> 28:51.600
So here's my question.

28:52.400 --> 28:56.560
And I think that this applies to a lot of different lifestyle

28:56.560 --> 28:56.960
things like this.

28:56.960 --> 28:58.560
I know what you're going to ask, Travis.

28:58.560 --> 28:59.920
Is Deadmau5 a furry?

28:59.920 --> 29:02.880
And I've wondered this myself for a really long time.

29:02.880 --> 29:03.760
What have you come to him?

29:04.400 --> 29:06.240
His head has robot parts in it.

29:06.240 --> 29:08.080
So I think he's part of a different community.

29:08.080 --> 29:09.520
I think he's part of-

29:09.520 --> 29:11.840
You're saying he's a steam furry.

29:12.720 --> 29:13.760
He's a sci-fury.

29:13.760 --> 29:16.080
No, wait, that sounds like a scary thing.

29:16.080 --> 29:19.280
My question is, do you need to swing for the fences

29:19.280 --> 29:21.440
right out the gate with your first fursuit?

29:21.440 --> 29:22.080
Oh, that's a good point.

29:22.080 --> 29:24.640
Go for the designer 2300 one.

29:24.640 --> 29:26.880
That is actually not a bad question, Travis.

29:26.880 --> 29:31.360
I once told myself that I was going to get into the juicing

29:31.360 --> 29:34.240
lifestyle that I was going to try like a juice fast.

29:34.800 --> 29:38.560
And I made it to the afternoon and it didn't go great.

29:38.560 --> 29:39.840
And I hated it.

29:39.840 --> 29:43.680
But because I was making an investment in this lifestyle,

29:43.680 --> 29:46.880
I had bought like a juicer that cost like $150.

29:46.880 --> 29:48.320
And now it just sits in my basement.

29:48.320 --> 29:49.280
If you want it, let me know.

29:50.960 --> 29:52.480
Especially at 20, man.

29:52.480 --> 29:54.160
Like you're working hard for this money.

29:54.160 --> 29:55.840
And I know you want to spend it on this thing.

29:55.840 --> 29:58.000
But you know, maybe around like 26,

29:58.000 --> 29:59.840
you'll be a lot more financially stable.

29:59.840 --> 30:02.640
And that's the time to invest in the really top of the line.

30:02.640 --> 30:04.880
Plus, maybe you don't like your furry after a while.

30:04.880 --> 30:07.440
Maybe you like want to try being a lion.

30:07.440 --> 30:08.240
That's a good point.

30:08.240 --> 30:11.200
I mean, is there some sort of, and again, no judgment,

30:11.200 --> 30:12.240
learning, education.

30:12.240 --> 30:16.560
Is there like a, is there like a tribalistic, like, oh, me?

30:16.560 --> 30:17.760
Like a pack mentality?

30:17.760 --> 30:18.880
No, not pack mentality.

30:18.880 --> 30:22.880
Like, do you have a fucking like spirit animal

30:22.880 --> 30:23.600
in the furry community?

30:23.600 --> 30:27.680
And then you're like, my shit is all about Arctic wolves.

30:27.680 --> 30:30.640
Oh, are you saying like, I, you know, I'm a possum

30:30.640 --> 30:31.920
and I've just always been a possum

30:31.920 --> 30:32.960
and I've never realized it.

30:32.960 --> 30:34.960
No, I'm not saying, I don't think it's kind of like dogs.

30:34.960 --> 30:36.880
I don't think the identity like goes that deep

30:36.880 --> 30:38.320
where it's like, I'm a dog.

30:38.320 --> 30:39.760
I think it, I think that it's,

30:39.760 --> 30:43.120
there's an acknowledgement of that.

30:43.120 --> 30:44.800
They are a human and a dog suit.

30:44.800 --> 30:46.480
I don't think that they actually think

30:46.480 --> 30:50.080
they're a dog and a human body, but I'm saying like,

30:50.080 --> 30:52.560
it's not something where you pick the animal.

30:52.560 --> 30:55.280
It's like the animal has to be confusing at the fur meats.

30:55.280 --> 30:58.320
Cause it'd be like, what happened to that fucking awesome

30:58.320 --> 31:00.960
looking horse that, oh, no, he's a squid now.

31:01.840 --> 31:02.160
Shit.

31:02.160 --> 31:02.320
Yeah.

31:02.320 --> 31:04.080
That would be, that would be confusing.

31:04.080 --> 31:06.800
I, first off, please friend,

31:06.800 --> 31:08.640
don't let your parents figure into this.

31:08.640 --> 31:10.000
You're the one busting your ass.

31:10.000 --> 31:10.720
It's your money.

31:11.680 --> 31:13.280
And you're 20 years old.

31:13.280 --> 31:14.880
Please just buy whatever you want.

31:14.880 --> 31:18.080
We're just saying, if it's your first one, why not?

31:18.080 --> 31:18.560
First.

31:19.680 --> 31:20.160
First.

31:21.040 --> 31:23.200
Why not spend a little less money?

31:23.760 --> 31:27.520
Get something that's not, you know, quite as good.

31:27.520 --> 31:29.760
And then we build to that.

31:29.760 --> 31:30.960
Just take it for a test drive.

31:30.960 --> 31:33.680
You know, if nothing else, just like give yourself a year

31:33.680 --> 31:35.680
and be like, yeah, there's definitely one that I want.

31:35.680 --> 31:37.360
But if, you know, I'm saying all this,

31:37.360 --> 31:41.440
but I don't know if like, I don't know if that's offensive.

31:41.440 --> 31:43.200
Like, I don't know if it's offensive,

31:43.200 --> 31:48.080
the idea that you're just like, get a new fursuit when you want.

31:48.080 --> 31:52.640
Like I'm wondering if it's like, there's more of a tie there.

31:52.640 --> 31:53.280
You know what I mean?

31:53.280 --> 31:56.560
Then I, then I know about, like it, it's, it's something

31:56.560 --> 31:59.040
much more with more gravitas than just like,

32:00.800 --> 32:02.320
a suit that you wear.

32:02.320 --> 32:04.800
There's more of a connection that you can't just dispose of.

32:04.800 --> 32:06.000
I think for me, it's just like,

32:06.000 --> 32:08.720
even at this point in my life, I'm almost 30.

32:08.720 --> 32:12.400
And like, if someone said, do you want to buy a car for $2,300?

32:12.400 --> 32:14.080
I'd still be like, oh, I don't know.

32:14.080 --> 32:15.120
That's a lot of money.

32:15.120 --> 32:16.880
I'm just saying, it's just like a huge,

32:16.880 --> 32:20.800
it's just a huge chunk to commit, especially, especially.

32:20.800 --> 32:22.240
And I know that they shouldn't figure into it,

32:22.240 --> 32:24.800
but like, if you've just hit the $2,300 mark

32:24.800 --> 32:28.000
and buying this will drop you to zero, you know what I mean?

32:28.000 --> 32:32.560
And what about, what if you pay $2,300

32:32.560 --> 32:35.520
and then you put it on and just all you can hear

32:35.520 --> 32:38.720
in your head is, it's itchy, I'm itchy and it's hot.

32:38.720 --> 32:39.600
I hate this.

32:39.600 --> 32:41.280
What if this person has been waiting

32:41.280 --> 32:44.240
for like a year and a half, they made this appointment

32:44.240 --> 32:47.520
a year and a half ago to see this world famous set.

32:47.520 --> 32:50.320
What if this is like fucking Hattori Hanzo steal?

32:50.320 --> 32:53.520
Like, what if this is like, this is his one shot.

32:54.080 --> 32:56.880
This is their one shot to get this sweet ass

32:56.880 --> 32:58.800
Hattori Hanzo suit, fursuit.

32:58.800 --> 33:00.320
That's a Hattori Hanzo eel.

33:02.320 --> 33:03.040
Do you know what I mean?

33:03.040 --> 33:04.800
Like this, this may be once in a lifetime.

33:04.800 --> 33:06.720
Justin just chopped a baseball in half.

33:06.720 --> 33:07.760
That's ridiculous.

33:07.760 --> 33:09.200
No, I know what you're saying.

33:09.200 --> 33:12.160
I mean, it is definitely throwing your hat over the fence

33:12.160 --> 33:13.360
as far as like-

33:13.360 --> 33:15.200
And that hat costs $800

33:15.200 --> 33:18.080
cause it's part of a $2,300 ensemble.

33:18.800 --> 33:21.120
I think end of the day, like Justin said,

33:21.120 --> 33:22.400
just don't let your parents figure into it.

33:22.400 --> 33:24.960
Like it's your life and you're the one making this decision.

33:24.960 --> 33:26.640
You're gonna be living with it, you're doing it.

33:26.640 --> 33:27.120
Yeah.

33:27.120 --> 33:30.000
So like, don't worry about what they say

33:30.000 --> 33:33.120
because it's not their life and you're, you know, an adult.

33:33.120 --> 33:34.800
Follow up question.

33:34.800 --> 33:36.160
I'm sorry to have so many questions.

33:36.160 --> 33:39.280
I hope people know it's not coming from a place of judgment.

33:39.280 --> 33:40.880
It's all about education and learning.

33:42.480 --> 33:43.680
And that you're asking us.

33:43.680 --> 33:46.480
And I'm asking you and you guys are both dummies.

33:47.840 --> 33:55.200
But when I worked during the summers as WTCR,

33:55.200 --> 33:56.880
our daddy's radio station,

33:56.880 --> 34:00.400
their mascot cowabunga in which I would dress up as a cow suit,

34:00.400 --> 34:03.680
I guess my overall question is, am I a furry?

34:05.120 --> 34:05.840
No.

34:05.840 --> 34:06.880
I did it too.

34:06.880 --> 34:09.120
And I would be happy to, I mean,

34:09.120 --> 34:12.000
if I had an end with the community like that,

34:12.000 --> 34:14.480
like I was a furry before they were even called that.

34:14.480 --> 34:14.980
Yeah.

34:16.000 --> 34:17.200
I would be willing to bet.

34:17.200 --> 34:20.720
I'm just gonna guess that there's a big difference

34:20.720 --> 34:23.120
between being a person who puts on a suit

34:23.120 --> 34:24.640
because you're getting paid to do it.

34:24.640 --> 34:25.200
Yeah.

34:25.200 --> 34:28.320
And being a part of a community that says,

34:28.320 --> 34:29.520
this is my lifestyle.

34:29.520 --> 34:32.880
In my defense, full disclosure, whenever I wore this suit,

34:32.880 --> 34:35.680
I would walk around screaming, I am a cow.

34:35.680 --> 34:36.400
Moo and shit.

34:37.040 --> 34:38.480
Cow, cow, cow, cow, cow.

34:38.480 --> 34:40.240
Also, in this person's defense,

34:40.240 --> 34:42.480
that fucking suit didn't cost $2,300.

34:42.480 --> 34:46.480
That suit maybe cost $52 at Magic Makers.

34:46.480 --> 34:50.480
And imagine wearing that to a fucking fur meat.

34:50.480 --> 34:51.680
Like, hey guys, can I play?

34:52.240 --> 34:53.920
I'm wearing a jumpsuit made of felt

34:53.920 --> 34:56.000
and my head is made of shitty paper mache.

34:56.000 --> 34:56.800
I'm one of you.

34:56.800 --> 34:58.080
Like, you're wicked not.

34:58.080 --> 34:59.920
This suit cost me 10 Gs.

34:59.920 --> 35:01.120
Cost me 10 stacks.

35:02.400 --> 35:03.920
It's got working gills.

35:03.920 --> 35:07.280
This is an actual suit I can swim in in the ocean forever.

35:07.280 --> 35:08.480
It's got gills in it and shit.

35:09.600 --> 35:11.360
The best part about the cowabunga suit

35:11.360 --> 35:13.760
is there was an upgrade made at some point

35:13.760 --> 35:16.880
where it also included an ice vest

35:16.880 --> 35:18.880
to try to keep yourself cool and comfortable

35:18.880 --> 35:19.680
inside the suit.

35:19.680 --> 35:23.840
So the experience was really, it was unparalleled.

35:23.840 --> 35:25.760
You would have frozen nipples.

35:25.760 --> 35:26.480
Yeah.

35:26.480 --> 35:28.240
And sweaty everything.

35:28.240 --> 35:30.720
Daddy, why is a cow not moving?

35:30.720 --> 35:31.600
Oh, his heart stopped.

35:33.120 --> 35:35.120
His body temperature was reduced

35:35.120 --> 35:36.320
to a point where his heart stopped.

35:36.320 --> 35:37.520
It's actually very interesting, son.

35:37.520 --> 35:39.200
Let me tell you about the science behind it.

35:39.200 --> 35:41.360
There was also two forms of cowabunga,

35:41.360 --> 35:44.560
the skinny form and then the fat form

35:44.560 --> 35:47.760
that included like this foam kind of fill out

35:48.480 --> 35:48.800
shaped like a bell.

35:48.800 --> 35:49.920
Did you do a t-trap?

35:49.920 --> 35:50.560
Yeah.

35:50.560 --> 35:51.120
All right, you did a t-trap.

35:51.120 --> 35:54.480
I was also in the key coyote and the B-97.

35:54.480 --> 35:59.200
Fuck, your fur credentials are like on point.

35:59.200 --> 36:01.920
Listen, I'm no Johnny Fur lately.

36:01.920 --> 36:02.480
You know what I mean?

36:02.480 --> 36:03.600
I do know what you mean.

36:03.600 --> 36:04.640
We're all furries.

36:04.640 --> 36:06.160
And if we're going to buy a new suit,

36:06.160 --> 36:07.120
we've got to get paid.

36:07.120 --> 36:19.120
Let's go to the money bag.

36:19.120 --> 36:20.560
Ugh, it happened again.

36:22.080 --> 36:23.600
Are you going to tell us like what?

36:23.600 --> 36:24.880
Or?

36:24.880 --> 36:25.840
It's my balls.

36:26.640 --> 36:29.760
You know, I turned my back on them for 30 seconds

36:29.760 --> 36:31.040
and they just start wandering.

36:31.040 --> 36:31.760
Hold up.

36:31.760 --> 36:35.120
How the fuck did you physically turn your back on your balls?

36:35.120 --> 36:36.640
I turned my back on my balls

36:36.640 --> 36:37.920
and they just start wandering.

36:37.920 --> 36:39.120
More pressing question.

36:39.120 --> 36:41.520
Do you dedicate every hour of the day,

36:41.520 --> 36:44.560
save for 30 seconds to just staring intently at your balls

36:44.560 --> 36:45.280
and making sure they don't get up in the-

36:45.280 --> 36:47.440
Don't go anywhere.

36:47.440 --> 36:49.520
I have to as the only option.

36:49.520 --> 36:50.480
It's the only option I have

36:50.480 --> 36:52.400
because as soon as I turn my back on them,

36:52.400 --> 36:54.800
they just start wandering all over my body.

36:54.800 --> 36:57.120
Isn't there a service you could pay or something

36:57.120 --> 36:58.080
to like do that for you

36:58.080 --> 36:59.280
so you could like get some sleep

36:59.280 --> 37:00.720
or like enjoy a meal?

37:00.720 --> 37:02.880
Got to be a better way.

37:04.720 --> 37:05.440
Well, good news.

37:06.080 --> 37:07.440
I know I'm the one with the problem.

37:07.440 --> 37:09.600
There's a wizard that lives in the forest

37:09.600 --> 37:10.880
that can cast a spell

37:10.880 --> 37:12.480
that can charm your balls to sleep.

37:14.160 --> 37:15.520
I'm giving you a brief resume.

37:15.520 --> 37:17.440
And this is a service that you can sign up for

37:17.440 --> 37:18.800
at extremerestraints.com.

37:20.480 --> 37:21.120
It is not.

37:21.120 --> 37:23.360
Betterextremerestraints.com, you could buy a cage

37:23.360 --> 37:27.760
for your penis that keeps it exactly where you want.

37:27.760 --> 37:28.880
The circle around the balls.

37:28.880 --> 37:29.840
I don't want to split hairs,

37:29.840 --> 37:31.200
but you did say balls.

37:31.200 --> 37:31.680
Is this-

37:31.680 --> 37:33.200
Listen, if you don't want to split hairs,

37:33.200 --> 37:34.480
you should stay away from a cage

37:34.480 --> 37:35.520
that goes around your penis.

37:38.640 --> 37:40.000
It's got a little lock on it.

37:40.000 --> 37:43.760
It's the CB6000S chastity device.

37:43.760 --> 37:46.080
Oh, the 6000S is out?

37:46.080 --> 37:48.800
Yeah, it's finally out of Japan.

37:48.800 --> 37:51.280
It's finally here in America.

37:51.280 --> 37:52.960
It comes in a lot of different sizes.

37:53.600 --> 37:54.960
Listen, just be honest with yourself

37:54.960 --> 37:55.840
when you buy it, okay?

37:57.040 --> 37:59.760
There's no metal for getting the biggest one.

38:00.320 --> 38:03.440
And it's got a hinge for added comfort,

38:03.440 --> 38:04.000
which seems-

38:04.800 --> 38:06.080
Counterintuitive a bit, maybe?

38:06.080 --> 38:07.280
Counterintuitive, yeah.

38:07.280 --> 38:08.800
They made a little prison for your dick,

38:08.800 --> 38:11.040
but it's got a very nice window in it

38:11.040 --> 38:12.960
so your dick can see outside.

38:12.960 --> 38:15.120
There's a little pillow and a private bathroom.

38:15.680 --> 38:16.160
It's nice.

38:16.160 --> 38:17.920
It's just one of like thousands,

38:17.920 --> 38:20.720
maybe millions of sex toys at ExtremeRestraints.com.

38:20.720 --> 38:23.040
Adult entertainment devices.

38:23.920 --> 38:25.680
They have a little bit of everything,

38:25.680 --> 38:29.840
no matter what the fetish or whatever thing

38:29.840 --> 38:31.920
that makes you sex better, they've got it.

38:32.720 --> 38:33.520
You know what I love?

38:33.520 --> 38:34.960
If Extreme Restraints just threw

38:34.960 --> 38:36.480
like a couple of products on there

38:37.040 --> 38:41.680
that just like that there was no sexual application for,

38:41.680 --> 38:43.120
just so as people were browsing through,

38:43.120 --> 38:44.400
they're like doing it, doing it,

38:44.400 --> 38:45.520
and they get like a skip it.

38:45.520 --> 38:47.280
And they're like, okay.

38:47.280 --> 38:48.560
I could find a fucking way.

38:48.560 --> 38:49.840
I could find a way to fuck with that.

38:51.680 --> 38:54.560
I've always wanted to challenge my dexterity.

38:55.920 --> 38:58.400

39:15.920 --> 39:17.360
the amazing coupon code,

39:17.920 --> 39:21.440
might actually be guilty of intellectual property theft

39:21.440 --> 39:23.600

with my dick prison?

39:47.280 --> 39:47.920
Yep.

39:47.920 --> 39:48.880
Uh, yeah.

39:48.880 --> 39:49.380
Cool.

39:50.000 --> 39:52.080
My pee pee looks like the girl from that 70s show,

39:52.080 --> 39:52.720
so that's perfect.

39:54.240 --> 39:55.440
My name is Graham Clark.

39:55.440 --> 39:56.560
My name is Dave Shumka.

39:56.560 --> 39:59.840
I'm the other guy who hosts Stop Podcasting Yourself.

39:59.840 --> 40:02.720
And I'm the other guy that hosts Stop Podcasting Yourself.

40:02.720 --> 40:05.760
We are from Canada, so we don't know many of your ways,

40:06.320 --> 40:09.040
but what we do know is quality podcasting.

40:09.040 --> 40:10.000
And whale blubber.

40:10.000 --> 40:10.560
Yeah.

40:10.560 --> 40:13.520
There's 50 different words for podcast in our language.

40:13.520 --> 40:14.880
We would say all 50 of them,

40:14.880 --> 40:16.960
but why don't you just listen to our show

40:16.960 --> 40:19.360
and you'll get the gist of what we're about.

40:19.360 --> 40:20.560
We bring a guest on.

40:20.560 --> 40:21.760
We talk about their lives.

40:21.760 --> 40:22.800
We talk about our lives.

40:22.800 --> 40:24.720
We talk about things they've overheard.

40:24.720 --> 40:25.920
It's a great time.

available from MaximumFun.org or on iTunes.

40:32.480 --> 40:33.280
Brr.

40:33.280 --> 40:35.280
That's what we say in Canada when we're cold.

40:36.080 --> 40:37.120
Farm wisdom.

40:37.680 --> 40:38.720
Farm wisdom.

40:39.520 --> 40:41.760
Get your cow into a soup.

40:41.760 --> 40:42.720
Farm wisdom.

40:42.720 --> 40:46.240
Oh, what if you put your cow in a person's suit?

40:46.240 --> 40:47.200
Oh yeah, I'm a humie.

40:47.200 --> 40:48.000
I'm a skin.

40:48.000 --> 40:48.720
I'm a flesh-o.

40:49.520 --> 40:50.400
What would they be called?

40:52.720 --> 40:53.440
Humies?

40:53.440 --> 40:54.640
Humies, maybe, I guess.

40:54.640 --> 40:55.280
I'm a humie.

40:56.400 --> 40:58.400
Cows are proven to have...

40:58.400 --> 40:59.600
Oh no, you know what, Travis?

40:59.600 --> 41:00.480
You should read farm wisdom.

41:00.480 --> 41:01.360
That's your thing, I think.

41:01.360 --> 41:02.160
Okay.

41:02.160 --> 41:04.720
Cows are proven to have best friends.

41:04.720 --> 41:06.400
If they are separated from each other,

41:06.400 --> 41:09.680
they get stressed and their milk yields suffer.

41:09.680 --> 41:10.640
That's from Victoria.

41:10.640 --> 41:13.840
Yeah, I don't know why,

41:13.840 --> 41:16.000
but I find that fucking heartwarming.

41:16.000 --> 41:16.560
Oh, it's amazing.

41:16.560 --> 41:17.440
I actually watched,

41:17.440 --> 41:19.200
there's this documentary on Netflix about,

41:19.200 --> 41:21.040
I think it's called Animal Odd Couples.

41:21.040 --> 41:24.880
And it's about this dog and this cheetah are best pals.

41:25.440 --> 41:28.320
And so to interview zookeepers, they're like,

41:28.320 --> 41:29.360
yeah, I don't know what fucking happened.

41:29.360 --> 41:31.120
This dog and cheetah just started hanging out together.

41:31.120 --> 41:32.800
But you knew that they just put them in a cage,

41:32.800 --> 41:33.760
like, let's see what'll happen.

41:34.800 --> 41:37.520
You know, they went through like 14 dogs and six cheetahs

41:37.520 --> 41:38.800
before they found the right mix.

41:38.800 --> 41:44.080
Griffin, I cannot imagine how bad of a day you have to have

41:44.080 --> 41:46.880
before you decide that you deserve Animal Odd Couples.

41:46.880 --> 41:49.920
We watched a very bleak marathon of Homeland.

41:49.920 --> 41:52.800
And I was like, we gotta fucking boost these spirits.

41:52.800 --> 41:54.160
Let's watch a monkey on a dog.

41:56.160 --> 41:57.840
Trav, any other farm wisdom this week?

41:57.840 --> 41:59.600
Yeah, I want Griffin to read the second one.

42:03.600 --> 42:05.280
This is one sent in by Laura, thank you.

42:05.280 --> 42:08.240
She says, if you want to get rid of a ground horse,

42:08.240 --> 42:10.480
get rid of a ground hog, pee in its hole.

42:10.480 --> 42:12.080
It will move to a better neighborhood.

42:13.600 --> 42:16.160
All the property values around here have just plummeted

42:16.160 --> 42:18.640
ever since Jeff peed in our burrow.

42:19.840 --> 42:21.440
I feel like a bad elements moved in

42:21.440 --> 42:23.680
ever since Jeff peed in here.

42:23.680 --> 42:24.880
Hey, Jeff, what are you doing?

42:25.840 --> 42:26.560
Hey, neighbor.

42:27.600 --> 42:29.520
Hey, neighbor, I'm just gardening.

42:30.240 --> 42:32.080
Yeah, I just put in my last mortgage payment today.

42:32.080 --> 42:33.200
We own the, oh, fuck.

42:33.200 --> 42:34.000
Oh, Jeff.

42:35.760 --> 42:37.520
Just repainted the kid's room.

42:37.520 --> 42:40.880
We pretty well have, oh, damn it, Jeff.

42:40.880 --> 42:43.200
At least the smell's gonna go, oh, you ate asparagus.

42:43.200 --> 42:44.320
Oh, fucking Jeff.

42:46.000 --> 42:48.240
You know, earlier today, I was telling Jeff

42:48.240 --> 42:49.600
about our ground hog problem.

42:49.600 --> 42:51.120
Oh, God damn it.

42:51.120 --> 42:52.560
God damn it, Julia.

42:52.560 --> 42:54.800
I told you not to tell Jeff about our ground hogs.

42:55.680 --> 42:57.200
Oh, he's outside already.

42:57.200 --> 42:57.920
Son of a bitch.

42:57.920 --> 43:00.320
I kind of feel like that's a catch all way

43:00.320 --> 43:02.480
to get anything to move out of the neighborhood.

43:02.480 --> 43:04.080
Like, is there an animal that like,

43:04.080 --> 43:05.920
you pee in its burrow and it's like, nice.

43:05.920 --> 43:09.280
Nice, sweet.

43:09.280 --> 43:10.400
Probably prairie dogs.

43:10.400 --> 43:13.360
Fucking nasty ass rodents.

43:16.000 --> 43:17.360
Let's get some piss up in here.

43:18.560 --> 43:21.120
Yeah, now the party's really getting started.

43:21.120 --> 43:22.240
We're all freaks.

43:23.920 --> 43:26.320
You know rattlesnakes are getting dirty.

43:26.320 --> 43:26.880
We love it.

43:27.920 --> 43:28.640
You guys wanna Yahoo?

43:29.360 --> 43:29.860
Please.

43:30.560 --> 43:33.280
This Yahoo was sent in by Bobby Mitchell.

43:33.280 --> 43:33.840
Thank you, Bobby.

43:33.840 --> 43:36.560
That's why Yahoo answers user demonica who asks.

43:39.280 --> 43:41.440
Do these guys want to steal my horse?

43:42.720 --> 43:44.560
It's very complicated, but I'm going to try

43:44.560 --> 43:45.760
my best of what's happening.

43:48.160 --> 43:50.560
I got a healthy, sorry, I already fucked up.

43:50.560 --> 43:52.240
I got an healthy race horse.

43:52.240 --> 43:54.400
He's four and beautiful and calm as anything.

43:54.400 --> 43:55.520
He's a dream horse.

43:55.520 --> 43:57.360
So anyway, there's a group of lads.

43:57.360 --> 43:59.440
They keep on pointing my horse out in the field

43:59.440 --> 44:00.320
or in the stable.

44:00.320 --> 44:02.320
They asked me if he was mine today.

44:02.320 --> 44:04.880
I was on a hack out with him,

44:04.880 --> 44:06.720
and the guys keep their eyes on him.

44:06.720 --> 44:08.400
And when they noticed I was watching them,

44:08.400 --> 44:09.440
they turned the other way.

44:09.440 --> 44:11.840
So when I came back to the stables,

44:11.840 --> 44:14.240
they were outside my stable door and said,

44:14.240 --> 44:15.760
oh, he's beautiful, isn't he?

44:15.760 --> 44:18.320
But there's something suspicious about their behavior, right?

44:19.360 --> 44:21.360
They also want to stop beating it.

44:21.360 --> 44:23.600
I also noticed, gross, I also noticed

44:23.600 --> 44:24.800
when I'm riding in the arena,

44:24.800 --> 44:27.600
they watch him in the far distance outside the gate.

44:27.600 --> 44:31.120
So any idea of why they seem more attached to my horse?

44:31.120 --> 44:32.320
Are they flirting?

44:32.320 --> 44:34.160
Other people are also interested in him,

44:34.160 --> 44:36.160
but they don't do what they do.

44:36.160 --> 44:38.080
So I'm finding their actions very suspicious.

44:38.080 --> 44:38.640
What should I do?

44:40.000 --> 44:41.520
She means, are they flirting with her?

44:42.320 --> 44:43.040
It's hard to tell.

44:44.800 --> 44:49.440
By lads, she may actually mean four other horses.

44:49.440 --> 44:52.080
Like horses are following her horse around.

44:52.080 --> 44:53.520
Gonna steal this horse.

44:53.520 --> 44:54.800
It'll be like horse taken.

44:56.640 --> 44:58.640
You know, I think that any,

44:58.640 --> 45:00.480
I think she might be projecting a little bit.

45:00.480 --> 45:03.360
She just loves that horse so much

45:04.560 --> 45:06.640
that she assumes everyone else

45:06.640 --> 45:08.640
would want to get into this dream horse.

45:10.080 --> 45:10.800
Get into it?

45:11.600 --> 45:13.520
Like get, you know, like get.

45:13.520 --> 45:14.720
They just want to take a, you know,

45:14.720 --> 45:17.520
they want to get inside, like sit in the passenger seat.

45:17.520 --> 45:18.320
Right, right, right.

45:18.320 --> 45:19.920
Get into its whole scenario.

45:20.960 --> 45:23.760
They think, hey, like, like you could, you know,

45:24.480 --> 45:25.760
really get into it.

45:25.760 --> 45:28.080
Like that scene in Ace Ventura when nature calls

45:28.080 --> 45:30.480
and he's inside the rhino.

45:30.480 --> 45:31.200
God, if we could go one episode.

45:31.200 --> 45:32.720
No, I don't mean like literally into.

45:32.720 --> 45:35.120
I mean, like, like when you go to the car dealership,

45:35.120 --> 45:37.920
it's like, I can get you into a new sedan.

45:37.920 --> 45:40.080
What's it gonna take to put you inside this horse?

45:40.080 --> 45:43.760
You know, I don't think a horse can have a side car, Justin,

45:43.760 --> 45:46.560
if that's what you're, if that's what you're suggesting.

45:46.560 --> 45:49.360
Does AC come standard on this horse?

45:49.360 --> 45:51.200
Is this a standard or automatic horse?

45:51.200 --> 45:52.320
I see.

45:52.320 --> 45:54.800
Can you even steal a horse?

45:54.800 --> 45:58.240
Like, if you can, the worst thing you can do

45:58.240 --> 46:00.400
is sit there and go, that's a beautiful horse.

46:00.400 --> 46:01.600
No, you know what?

46:01.600 --> 46:02.400
What kind of oats?

46:02.400 --> 46:06.160
Does he eat any kind of special oats?

46:06.160 --> 46:08.400
How would I steal him, just hypothetically?

46:08.400 --> 46:10.640
The problem with the idea of stealing a horse

46:10.640 --> 46:13.600
is because it implies that you can own a horse

46:13.600 --> 46:14.800
and as we all know.

46:14.800 --> 46:15.520
Not possible.

46:15.520 --> 46:16.880
Nobody can own a horse.

46:16.880 --> 46:19.440
They are like freedom incarnate.

46:19.440 --> 46:21.920
You can steal a dream.

46:21.920 --> 46:25.040
Can you steal a hope?

46:25.040 --> 46:26.400
Can you steal wishes?

46:26.400 --> 46:29.040
At best, you can form a partnership,

46:29.040 --> 46:31.360
a voluntary partnership with a horse.

46:31.360 --> 46:32.400
At best.

46:32.400 --> 46:35.840
There is no title involved in the process.

46:36.960 --> 46:40.320
And if anything, it's a tenuous agreement.

46:40.320 --> 46:42.000
Can you steal a sunset?

46:44.880 --> 46:45.380
Can you?

46:47.040 --> 46:47.520
Travis.

46:48.880 --> 46:50.160
I imagine it's also-

46:50.160 --> 46:52.080
Answer the question, Travis.

46:52.080 --> 46:52.960
Oh, sorry.

46:52.960 --> 46:54.560
Answer my question about sunsets.

46:56.080 --> 46:56.580
Yes.

46:57.920 --> 46:59.120
In Oceans 14.

47:01.200 --> 47:02.560
Why is it so dark?

47:02.560 --> 47:04.240
It's like fucking-

47:04.240 --> 47:05.360
We're stealing the sun.

47:05.920 --> 47:08.080
You fucking lost it, Danny Ocean.

47:08.080 --> 47:09.520
We're gonna get killed.

47:09.520 --> 47:11.280
We're gonna get killed by the mafia

47:11.280 --> 47:12.480
unless we bring them the sun.

47:13.280 --> 47:15.440
We just need to build the ladder big enough.

47:15.440 --> 47:17.760
Okay, you smell like poop

47:17.760 --> 47:20.080
and you haven't cut your hair in six years.

47:20.080 --> 47:20.800
Bum bum.

47:20.800 --> 47:23.040
We gotta get the Asian guy to jump up to the sun.

47:24.960 --> 47:27.200
Brad Pitt's character won't stop eating human flesh.

47:27.200 --> 47:28.880
We gotta hold him up and hide him in a rocket.

47:29.520 --> 47:31.360
Hide him in the rocket that NASA sends up there

47:31.360 --> 47:33.360
and then he'll jump to the sun.

47:33.360 --> 47:36.480
So Brad Pitt, did you get 14 people to help with this mission?

47:36.480 --> 47:40.720
No, everybody thinks it's kind of dumb.

47:40.720 --> 47:42.480
It's kind of a bad mission, I think.

47:44.000 --> 47:46.320
Because they don't see how we make any money off of it,

47:46.320 --> 47:48.800
which I think is short-sighted, but I do see their point.

47:48.800 --> 47:50.480
The only guy we got was Scott Conn.

47:51.600 --> 47:53.600
He's not doing anything.

47:54.800 --> 47:57.360
I told him lunch would be provided and he was in.

47:58.320 --> 48:00.880
His identical brother Casey Affleck was busy.

48:01.600 --> 48:02.960
I don't think you can steal.

48:02.960 --> 48:05.520
I think the horse won't be cool with it.

48:05.520 --> 48:06.080
That's the thing.

48:06.080 --> 48:07.600
I imagine it's hard to steal something

48:07.600 --> 48:10.560
that actively wants to return from whence it came.

48:11.760 --> 48:12.640
Because what good is that?

48:12.640 --> 48:16.400
You got a horse that you could never put out in the field

48:16.400 --> 48:18.720
or it's just gonna be like, peace, come back to where the apples are.

48:18.720 --> 48:20.480
You have to indoctrinate that.

48:20.480 --> 48:23.200
You have to, right, you have to brainwash the horse.

48:23.200 --> 48:25.120
It's got to be very much like Homeland.

48:25.120 --> 48:25.760
You know what I mean?

48:26.400 --> 48:29.600
I'm not saying beat the horse until it loves you,

48:30.560 --> 48:33.200
even though that is basically the only interaction

48:33.200 --> 48:35.760
that us stupid humans understand with those horses.

48:37.440 --> 48:41.520
I don't think that horses have the sort of homeward bound instinct

48:41.520 --> 48:44.160
that you guys want them to have.

48:44.160 --> 48:47.360
I don't think that if you get a horse in Colorado,

48:47.360 --> 48:50.880
horses are gonna be like, well, it's back to Ohio for me.

48:50.880 --> 48:52.960
If a horse is gonna run back to Ohio,

48:52.960 --> 48:56.000
you better help their own apples in between those two.

48:56.000 --> 48:59.360
As the crow flies, they had better not pass any apples

48:59.360 --> 49:01.680
because that horse will stop and live there.

49:03.280 --> 49:04.800
If you're gonna steal the horse,

49:05.520 --> 49:07.280
you have to form a partnership with it.

49:07.280 --> 49:08.560
I am going to try and do this

49:08.560 --> 49:14.400
because I don't have the money to do this.

49:14.400 --> 49:18.320
You got to throw down some negs first, right?

49:18.320 --> 49:20.080
You got to insult the horse a little bit.

49:21.440 --> 49:24.320
And that's how you get the horse interested in you.

49:25.280 --> 49:28.080
So you say like, oh, I don't think you run very fast.

49:28.080 --> 49:30.400
Your mane isn't glorious and beautiful,

49:30.400 --> 49:32.560
like the most beautiful head of human hair.

49:33.840 --> 49:35.760
And then you give them some oats.

49:35.760 --> 49:37.200
Griffin, you're just cribbing stuff

49:37.200 --> 49:38.800
that you learned from the Giddy Up artist.

49:42.640 --> 49:45.520
Imagine like a little jockey with this big stupid hat.

49:46.160 --> 49:47.760
Do you know that show was filmed in Austin?

49:49.200 --> 49:52.560
Those fucking douchers left like an irreparable scar on this city.

49:52.560 --> 49:55.280
I'm surprised that anybody can pick up anybody for any reason.

49:56.320 --> 49:56.720
Ever.

49:56.720 --> 49:57.440
Ever.

49:57.440 --> 50:00.480
Hey brothers, I just started a new minimum wage job

50:00.480 --> 50:03.120
and my mom won't stop asking how it went.

50:03.120 --> 50:06.000
I like my job, but nothing really happens at the bakery.

50:06.000 --> 50:08.800
How do I include her in my life without boring her?

50:08.800 --> 50:10.720
That's from vague and vacant.

50:11.520 --> 50:14.320
When she asks you to say, you know, making dough,

50:15.760 --> 50:17.760
and you do that enough and she'll stop asking.

50:19.760 --> 50:25.760
Oh man, it's been in my, like speaking from experience,

50:25.760 --> 50:30.240
I can say that when questions ask about boring shit,

50:30.240 --> 50:32.640
then our answers are usually pretty exciting.

50:32.640 --> 50:36.240
I mean, you can make stuff up.

50:36.240 --> 50:37.040
You can lie.

50:37.760 --> 50:38.800
How was your day?

50:38.800 --> 50:40.560
It was fucking wild, mom.

50:40.560 --> 50:44.000
Oh, let me, you're not going to believe it.

50:44.000 --> 50:47.040
Pat Sajak came in, that's burned the place to the ground.

50:47.040 --> 50:50.000
That's your, that's just lost, lost his shit.

50:50.000 --> 50:50.880
That's your big day?

50:51.440 --> 50:53.360
Took three people to wrestle him to the ground.

50:53.360 --> 50:55.040
He was foaming at the mouth.

50:55.040 --> 50:56.400
He was riding a stolen horse.

50:56.400 --> 50:58.240
He jumped through a plate glass window.

50:58.240 --> 50:59.360
I thought I would hear about that.

50:59.360 --> 51:01.040
And he just, he just, he just, he just,

51:01.040 --> 51:02.720
kept screaming, popper nickel.

51:02.720 --> 51:04.800
Why wouldn't I hear about this in the news?

51:05.360 --> 51:06.720
It's a big government coverup.

51:08.720 --> 51:11.040
Apparently he had escaped from a government testing facility

51:11.040 --> 51:12.480
where they were testing cheek kissing.

51:12.480 --> 51:13.520
And he just fucking lost it.

51:13.520 --> 51:15.920
Now I don't think that this is, I think you're.

51:15.920 --> 51:19.200
Mom, mom, try this free sourdough I brought you.

51:19.200 --> 51:23.280
Let me, is this laces?

51:23.280 --> 51:24.320
Oh, oh.

51:27.600 --> 51:29.040
Sorry mom, you knew too much.

51:29.040 --> 51:36.480
This is funny, I like this podcast.

51:39.120 --> 51:43.120
Oh man, this is the great thing about having three guys on it

51:43.120 --> 51:45.920
is like every once in a while, one of us can just sort of,

51:45.920 --> 51:46.880
it's usually me.

51:46.880 --> 51:47.040
Yeah.

51:47.040 --> 51:49.840
If you need to rotate out, you just go back to the back of the line.

51:54.080 --> 51:56.160
It's like, I say something funny and you guys just,

51:56.160 --> 51:59.440
we need a schedule, we've been putting it off for a long time.

51:59.440 --> 52:02.080
Some of the color coded in our weekly calendars.

52:03.280 --> 52:06.480
I feel like at the beginning we needed all three of us

52:06.480 --> 52:07.600
to be working constantly,

52:07.600 --> 52:10.240
but I feel like we're getting closer to peak efficiency

52:10.240 --> 52:11.920
or peak not giving a shit.

52:11.920 --> 52:15.040
So we may want to just revisit that whole schedule thing.

52:16.160 --> 52:16.640
I love it.

52:17.920 --> 52:18.720
Read the next question.

52:18.720 --> 52:19.600
Sounds like it'll be good.

52:20.640 --> 52:24.800
Regularly, I'll be having a conversation with someone

52:24.800 --> 52:27.760
and they'll drop the combo of excessively complimenting me

52:27.760 --> 52:29.360
and criticizing themselves.

52:29.360 --> 52:31.760
I'm never sure how to respond in this situation.

52:31.760 --> 52:33.280
I've tried complimenting them back,

52:33.280 --> 52:35.120
telling them not to be so hard on themselves

52:35.120 --> 52:37.840
or ignoring their criticism and just accepting the compliment,

52:37.840 --> 52:39.840
but it all feels hollow and weird.

52:40.640 --> 52:43.680
There are three people in my life who do this all the time.

52:43.680 --> 52:45.760
One of whom is my boss slash advisor,

52:45.760 --> 52:46.880
who I work closely with.

52:48.080 --> 52:49.600
What should I do when this comes up?

52:50.160 --> 52:52.080
That's from so hard on yourself.

52:52.080 --> 52:55.280
I would also say that if you have three people

52:55.280 --> 52:57.120
and it sounds like you're only required

52:57.120 --> 52:58.800
to actually spend time with one of them,

52:59.520 --> 53:02.880
then you have an opportunity to drop at least two of them

53:02.880 --> 53:04.000
from the roster.

53:04.000 --> 53:07.760
And the way you do that is you have them talk to each other

53:08.400 --> 53:13.200
and they form a recursive compliment criticizing cycle

53:14.000 --> 53:17.200
that they talk to each other until they both die of old age.

53:18.400 --> 53:19.920
And then you only have but one to deal with.

53:19.920 --> 53:22.400
Mm-hmm. And then you only have but one to deal with.

53:22.400 --> 53:24.880
You could also easily cut them out by when they're like,

53:24.880 --> 53:26.960
no, you're pretty and I'm ugly.

53:26.960 --> 53:28.320
You go, yep. Yep.

53:28.320 --> 53:29.200
Check out my style.

53:30.320 --> 53:33.680
That's not your opinion, that's fact.

53:33.680 --> 53:35.200
And you're kind of a dumpo.

53:35.200 --> 53:36.960
You're kind of a dumper.

53:36.960 --> 53:38.400
This is tough because you don't,

53:39.200 --> 53:41.360
I mean, on the one hand, you don't want to give,

53:41.360 --> 53:42.960
you don't want to reinforce this behavior

53:42.960 --> 53:44.320
by giving the person what they seek,

53:44.320 --> 53:45.440
which is a bunch of compliments.

53:45.440 --> 53:50.160
Hmm. What's the second half of that?

53:50.160 --> 53:52.240
That's it. I mean, you don't, that's it.

53:52.240 --> 53:54.480
I mean, what's the alternative is you have to sit there

53:54.480 --> 53:56.800
and tell them that, yeah, uh-huh.

53:56.800 --> 53:58.160
Yeah, you got it about right.

53:58.160 --> 54:00.320
Because psychologically, the other problem is,

54:00.320 --> 54:01.680
is that if you do it,

54:01.680 --> 54:03.920
not only are you reinforcing behavior,

54:03.920 --> 54:06.240
but it also drives home for them that the only reason

54:06.240 --> 54:08.480
they're getting complimented is because of this.

54:08.480 --> 54:11.120
And it actually hurts their self-esteem in the long run

54:11.120 --> 54:12.880
because it's like, they wouldn't have complimented me

54:12.880 --> 54:14.640
if I hadn't asked them to.

54:14.640 --> 54:15.760
I think you're- And you know what I mean?

54:16.480 --> 54:17.840
And it becomes a bigger problem.

54:17.840 --> 54:20.640
Your only response is, I think,

54:20.640 --> 54:23.440
a broad, sweeping generalization

54:24.080 --> 54:26.480
about just the futility of everything.

54:28.080 --> 54:31.840
So they're like, I'm just, I'm so ugly and you're so pretty

54:31.840 --> 54:33.040
and I wish I could look like you.

54:33.040 --> 54:35.440
Like, well, I mean, my looks are gonna fade,

54:35.440 --> 54:38.720
looks always fade until we are returned unto the loam.

54:40.160 --> 54:43.680
But in the long run, I mean, we're all just dust anyways, right?

54:43.680 --> 54:46.000
Think about it. We're all just a big cosmic joke.

54:46.000 --> 54:48.400
Matter's default state is chaos.

54:48.400 --> 54:48.960
Think about it.

54:49.520 --> 54:51.920
Our lives are just a fucking blink of an eye

54:51.920 --> 54:52.880
in the grand scheme of things.

54:52.880 --> 54:55.120
My good looks have also pretty much ensured

54:55.120 --> 54:57.840
that nobody's ever going to help me pick up my groceries.

54:58.800 --> 55:01.840
So. So my life is pretty much shit too.

55:01.840 --> 55:04.880
Maybe think about that a little bit before you start whining.

55:05.680 --> 55:07.920
Maybe ask them more questions

55:07.920 --> 55:09.280
about why they feel the way they feel.

55:09.280 --> 55:11.360
Just kind of get, try to get to the root of it, you know?

55:12.080 --> 55:13.040
Oh, why do you feel that way?

55:13.040 --> 55:14.320
Why do you think that?

55:14.320 --> 55:15.920
Like a psychoanalyzation.

55:16.640 --> 55:17.920
But it could be like,

55:18.480 --> 55:20.640
why do you feel that way about your own looks?

55:20.640 --> 55:23.280
And they could be like, elephantitis, dude.

55:23.280 --> 55:26.240
Like, look at me.

55:26.240 --> 55:26.880
Fucking come on.

55:26.880 --> 55:28.240
Because of that acid incident, you dick.

55:28.880 --> 55:30.800
Also, you're Charlize Theron.

55:30.800 --> 55:33.360
So like, that's why I made that comparison.

55:33.360 --> 55:34.960
So like, that seems pretty obvious.

55:36.080 --> 55:37.040
Ooh, what about this?

55:37.040 --> 55:38.480
Is this helpful advice?

55:38.480 --> 55:39.920
Just fact check me here.

55:39.920 --> 55:40.160
Okay.

55:40.160 --> 55:45.360
Just start complimenting them before the cycle starts.

55:45.360 --> 55:46.080
Whoa.

55:46.080 --> 55:47.760
So when you see them, be like,

55:47.760 --> 55:50.160
hey, is that a new haircut, a new shirt?

55:50.160 --> 55:51.360
You look great today.

55:51.360 --> 55:53.600
And they'll be like, but they'll find the thing.

55:53.600 --> 55:55.520
They'll be like, yeah, but I'm real dumb.

55:55.520 --> 55:57.920
And then they'll be like, well, fuck.

55:57.920 --> 55:59.920
Well, then if that happens, if that happens,

55:59.920 --> 56:00.960
you're completely justified.

56:00.960 --> 56:03.600
I'm like, Susan, just gave you a compliment.

56:03.600 --> 56:04.560
Don't do that.

56:04.560 --> 56:06.000
That's the perfect thing.

56:06.000 --> 56:06.800
Susan.

56:06.800 --> 56:08.960
Don't fucking undercut me on this.

56:08.960 --> 56:10.800
Don't fucking undercut me on this.

56:10.800 --> 56:13.440
I said your new shirt looked nice.

56:13.440 --> 56:15.680
You started talking about your butt or something,

56:15.680 --> 56:16.880
and I hate it.

56:16.880 --> 56:17.840
Susan.

56:17.840 --> 56:19.040
Classic Susan.

56:19.040 --> 56:22.160
This is like, pure Susan.

56:22.160 --> 56:26.400
This is unfiltered, fresh from a mountain spring, Susan.

56:26.400 --> 56:29.760
Maybe you go even deeper with Susan.

56:29.760 --> 56:32.800
Instead of Inception complimenting her,

56:32.800 --> 56:35.440
when you go in for a hug and a cheek kiss,

56:35.440 --> 56:37.760
when you're in there, you lean into her ear,

56:37.760 --> 56:40.880
and you say, don't even fucking start, Susan.

56:40.880 --> 56:45.520
Susan, don't even get fucking started.

56:45.520 --> 56:46.400
And then you pull back.

56:46.400 --> 56:48.320
Susan, this may seem like the day,

56:48.320 --> 56:51.600
this is not the day for your shit.

56:51.600 --> 56:54.080
Susan.

56:54.080 --> 56:55.520
This is my house now, Susan.

56:55.520 --> 56:56.640
Susan, we're all-

56:56.640 --> 56:58.080
The dynamic done changed.

56:58.080 --> 57:01.200
We're all working real hard, Susan,

57:01.200 --> 57:03.760
to put up with Susan.

57:03.760 --> 57:07.920
Why don't you give us one day's respite from your shit?

57:07.920 --> 57:10.480
Susan, look around you.

57:10.480 --> 57:13.440
You are standing on a razor.

57:13.440 --> 57:16.320
This is the edge of a razor,

57:16.320 --> 57:17.920
and you are on it.

57:17.920 --> 57:21.360
Also, just real quick wanted to tell you

57:21.360 --> 57:23.920
that you smell delicious.

57:23.920 --> 57:25.520
As long as-

57:25.520 --> 57:27.680
You have on Dr. Pepper lip gloss.

57:27.680 --> 57:28.640
What is that?

57:28.640 --> 57:31.680
It is enchanting.

57:31.680 --> 57:34.640
Susan, you smell enchanting, and today is not the day-

57:34.640 --> 57:35.840
Today is-

57:35.840 --> 57:37.440
But don't get me wrong,

57:37.440 --> 57:39.520
enchanting lip smell or not,

57:39.520 --> 57:40.320
I'll fucking end you.

57:40.320 --> 57:42.320
Now, Susan, I don't want you to get freaked out,

57:42.320 --> 57:43.440
but I'm gonna try something.

57:47.680 --> 57:48.240
Was that good?

57:48.240 --> 57:50.240
And then meanwhile, your coworkers are going,

57:50.240 --> 57:53.200
she's been talking to her boss for like 20 minutes

57:53.200 --> 57:54.160
in her ear.

57:54.160 --> 57:54.960
I don't know what's going on.

57:54.960 --> 57:56.160
I think she wants a raise.

57:56.160 --> 57:57.600
Did she just kiss her on the cheek?

57:57.600 --> 57:58.640
Let's get that started.

58:00.080 --> 58:00.560
Let's all do it.

58:00.560 --> 58:01.920
Best friend club.

58:01.920 --> 58:02.400
Craig, come here.

58:02.400 --> 58:03.200
I want to try something.

58:03.200 --> 58:05.040
I just saw Jenny do it to Susan.

58:05.040 --> 58:05.520
It's great.

58:05.520 --> 58:06.240
Come here.

58:06.240 --> 58:06.720
Come here.

58:07.760 --> 58:08.480
Come here.

58:08.480 --> 58:08.960
Hey, Craig.

58:12.080 --> 58:13.280
Dope fucking stuff.

58:13.280 --> 58:15.040
Craig, I wish I could just live on your shoulder.

58:16.800 --> 58:18.320
You smell so much better than Susan.

58:18.320 --> 58:19.280
Don't tell Susan.

58:19.280 --> 58:20.000
Smell Susan.

58:20.000 --> 58:21.200
I'm right here.

58:21.200 --> 58:22.400
Susan.

58:22.400 --> 58:22.800
Come here.

58:22.800 --> 58:24.240
Bring your head closer to Craig's head.

58:27.440 --> 58:28.560
I'm gonna conference you in.

58:28.560 --> 58:29.680
Smell Craig real quick.

58:29.680 --> 58:30.400
Now smell yourself.

58:30.400 --> 58:32.320
Craig smells like cronuts.

58:32.320 --> 58:32.880
I love it.

58:34.720 --> 58:35.760
Do we eat cronuts today, Craig?

58:36.720 --> 58:37.520
I think I love Craig.

58:39.920 --> 58:40.800
Guys, I have an announcement.

58:40.800 --> 58:41.680
I think I love Craig.

58:44.960 --> 58:45.600
This just in.

58:46.480 --> 58:47.440
Griffin loves Craig.

58:47.440 --> 58:48.480
And you know who we love?

58:48.480 --> 58:52.000
We love you for listening to our advice show,

58:52.000 --> 58:53.040

58:55.840 --> 59:00.240
Uh, thank you to everybody tweeting about the show.

I don't think we've given out our email address in a long time.

59:29.040 --> 59:31.760
It's MBMBAM at Maximumfun.org.

59:32.480 --> 59:33.840
Um, you can send us questions.

59:33.840 --> 59:34.800
You can send us Yahoo's.

59:34.800 --> 59:37.600
Thank you to everybody who sent in Yahoo's this week.

59:38.400 --> 59:42.880
Um, also check out the other shows on Maximumfun.org.

59:42.880 --> 59:45.600
There's a ton of great super free comedy podcasts,

59:45.600 --> 59:49.200
like Throwing Shade, Jordan and Jesse Go, Stop Podcasting Yourself,

59:49.200 --> 59:53.120
Wham Bam Pow, One Bad Mother, Bullseye, Judge John Hodgman,

59:53.120 --> 59:55.440
and Risk, The Memory Palace.

59:56.640 --> 59:57.600
And Sawboners.

59:57.600 --> 59:58.320
Sawboners.

59:58.320 --> 01:00:00.400
Is that show still on?

01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:00.800
Got them.

01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:02.080
It's not what it's called.

01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:03.360
I think it's called Sawboners.

01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:04.240
It's called Sawbones.

01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:05.360
It's a medical history show.

01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:07.280
I do it with my wife and it's great.

01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:08.480
And it's better than this dumb show.

01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:10.000
At least you'll fucking learn something.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.120
Listen, by the way, Justin,

01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:13.360
I feel like you've been stealing a lot of our market share.

01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:14.560
Yeah, we need to talk.

01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:15.680
We'll talk about that off the air.

01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:21.680
But, um, uh, if you want to have a spot on our, uh, on our money zone,

01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:24.720
just go to maximumfund.org forward slash Jumbotron.

01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:26.160
You can get a personal message.

01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:30.640
You can, uh, get a message for your business or website,

01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:36.320
or if you work for an organization or are yourself a one person organization,

01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:38.800
then you can have a super professional one,

01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:41.520
just like we do for, uh, Extreme Restraints everywhere.

01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:41.680
Yeah.

01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:44.240
If you want to do a personal message where you talk about how much you love

01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:47.440
Extreme Restraints line of products, that would actually be great for us.

01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:49.840
Just in like a time saving level.

01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:51.040
Think of us is what we're saying.

01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:54.240
Just think of us when you, when you give us money to talk about you.

01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:58.000
I also want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.720
It's a departure off the album, putting the days to bed.

01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:06.080
Got a lot of complaints during the, um, the early years compilation.

01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:08.400
They're like, where's that John Roderick and the Long Winters song.

01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:11.440
And I said, I'm sorry, I don't know what Justin was doing.

01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:15.280
I was just trying to get retro for one episode.

01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:16.240
Just one episode.

01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:17.120
It's old school.

01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:17.520
Yeah.

01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:20.480
Why are you so eager to move away from the past or from what?

01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:21.760
Why are you so afraid of what the future?

01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:24.880
Cause I sounded like a fucking nerd bird back then.

01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:25.760
And I don't know why.

01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:28.960
He had a lot of growing up to do to beat yourself up.

01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:29.840
I guess that's true.

01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:30.880
You want one final Yahoo?

01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:32.000
Please.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:32.480
I'm ready.

01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:36.960
This one final Yahoo was sent in by Jonathan Bodd.

01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:37.840
Thank you, Jonathan.

01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:44.400
It's by Yahoo answers user Livipud who asks, what is cilantro?

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.280
I'm Justin McElroy.

01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:50.000
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.280
I'm Griffin McElroy.

01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:52.640
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:53.680
Kiss your dad.

01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:55.680
Squat on the lips.
