WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:06.000 --> 00:12.000
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:12.000 --> 00:19.000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
What's up, you cool baby?

00:21.000 --> 00:30.000
Change your mind on the first in line Honey, I'm still free, take a chance on me

00:30.000 --> 00:34.000
If you need me, let me know, I'm gonna be around

00:34.000 --> 00:40.000
If you got no place to go when you're feeling down

00:40.000 --> 00:45.000
If you're all alone, when the pretty birds are gone

00:45.000 --> 00:52.000
On Tosh.0, that's right, it's your favorite Hollywood celebrities, my brother, my brother, and me.

00:52.000 --> 00:57.000
You may know us from Comedy Central's hit, Tosh.0, where we were.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
Would you say featured?

00:59.000 --> 01:03.000
I would say we cameoed. I got a call.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
I would say spotlighted, at least.

01:05.000 --> 01:08.000
I got a call on my mobile from my boy Tosh.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
Yeah, just didn't happen.

01:10.000 --> 01:15.000
That's what I call him. My boy Tosh.0 called up, he was like, hey, listen, I was just in the editing bay,

01:15.000 --> 01:20.000
somebody was wearing one of your shirts on one of my funny segments on my funny internet show,

01:20.000 --> 01:25.000
and I just wanted to get your permission to put it on the air.

01:25.000 --> 01:32.000
And I said, Tosh, you and I go way back, I'll allow it.

01:32.000 --> 01:36.000
So, Tosh, if you're listening, I hope I didn't just cramp your style.

01:36.000 --> 01:43.000
No. Now, we actually do a big thanks to Gregory Posey,

01:43.000 --> 01:48.000
who had the forethought to, before he ate a disgusting 100% cacao bar,

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
to put on his My Brother, My Brother, and Me t-shirts.

01:51.000 --> 01:56.000
So, he is leading in terms of My Brother, My Brother, and Me fandom, I think it's fair to say.

01:56.000 --> 02:02.000
You should follow him on Twitter, he is Mr. Dr. Muffin, which is also a very good name.

02:02.000 --> 02:07.000
First stomp, Tosh.0, next stomp, Law and Order.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
I'd like to get on Tosh.1.

02:09.000 --> 02:16.000
If you're going to commit a terrible crime that is going to result in notoriety,

02:16.000 --> 02:21.000
just strap on him a Bim Bam t-shirt underneath your Kevlar vest.

02:21.000 --> 02:26.000
No, don't actually wear the Kevlar vest, because you'll distract from the branding.

02:26.000 --> 02:32.000
But just, you know, if you're going to do something big... There's nothing I want to see more than a guy

02:32.000 --> 02:39.000
charging and screaming about something, and law enforcement tries to bring him down,

02:39.000 --> 02:44.000
and the bullets rip through his My Brother, My Brother, and Me t-shirt, but hit Kevlar,

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
and he's like, rawr, you can't bring me down!

02:46.000 --> 02:50.000
And it gives the false impression that our shirts are bulletproof.

02:50.000 --> 02:58.000
When asked, the suspect replied, I guess it's time to pack my bags and move away.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
Back to you, Jim.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
Don't actually do any of the things we just said.

03:01.000 --> 03:05.000
Don't do any of the things we said, but that's a pretty common rule here on My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
It's an advice show for the modern era.

03:08.000 --> 03:12.000
We don't suggest you do anything we tell you to.

03:12.000 --> 03:18.000
Even if our advice is good, occasionally we have to legally sort of cover ourselves that way.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
I feel like we've danced around this enough.

03:21.000 --> 03:28.000
I think it's time to get a spoon and really dig into the advice portion of the show.

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
So, let's hear from AtSholi17.

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
She's on the Twitter service.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
She says, Hi guys.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
Hi, Sholi.

03:37.000 --> 03:43.000
I'm a 22-year-old gal and I need a clever original costume to wear to my friend's Halloween party.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
Any suggestions?

03:45.000 --> 03:51.000
If I had one, I would probably use it myself.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
I probably wouldn't give it out.

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
I'm so terrible at coming up with Halloween costumes.

03:57.000 --> 04:03.000
The best thing is always, I think, to do a group of people doing something.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
Yeah, then you've got solidarity.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
What about a sexy dragon?

04:06.000 --> 04:10.000
I don't know why a sexy dragon, but sexy things are pretty popular with girls.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
Everybody likes a dragon, right?

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
Sexy werewolf?

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
See, that's the thing.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
She needs it to be clever and original.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
I think the dragon portion of that is okay.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
What about a frumpy dragon?

04:20.000 --> 04:25.000
What about a confident, unattractive dragon?

04:25.000 --> 04:29.000
How about a sexy, frumpy person?

04:29.000 --> 04:37.000
Yeah, like your hair is disheveled in a sexy way and you're wearing a stupid plaid dress, but it's too short.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
I was like, whoa.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
You're frumpy, but also very attractive.

04:40.000 --> 04:47.000
I don't think we can help you on this because I think that your Halloween costume is a true sign of creativity.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
Creativity comes from inside.

04:49.000 --> 04:53.000
For instance, my favorite Halloween costume is one that Travis told me about.

04:53.000 --> 05:01.000
It was at a party, I believe, in Oklahoma where someone came to the Halloween party wearing just a pair of jeans.

05:01.000 --> 05:07.000
When asked what he was, he said premature ejaculation because he just came in his pants.

05:07.000 --> 05:18.000
That is the best Halloween costume ever because it's a joke, it's clever, and it transforms you.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
It's transformative.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
The best thing we can do, Shirley, is tell you what to avoid.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
Here's a costume I can't stand.

05:24.000 --> 05:30.000
A production costume where you get there and everybody's like, oh my God, what an elaborate costume.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
Within minutes, you are sweating and you just...

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
Chunks are falling off.

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
Chunks of it are falling off because she paper mache-ed it to your body.

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
Half hour in, you just look like a nightmare.

05:42.000 --> 05:47.000
All the sexy dragons and sexy frumpy people are scooping up all the dudes.

05:47.000 --> 05:56.000
I think what you should do is you should go as a group, find a group of people, and do sexy Supreme Court justices.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
That's good.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
That's a good one.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
So do mine.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
I am more.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
What?

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
She plays softball, you know.

06:04.000 --> 06:08.000
What do you guys think is going to be the hot one this year?

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
Two years ago, it was the Joker.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
Everyone was the Joker, right?

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
Last year, it was Balloon Boy, right?

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
What?

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
Everybody was Balloon Boy.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
I miss that trend.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
I got to get Balloon Boy.

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
I was creeped out by sexy Balloon Boy, though.

06:25.000 --> 06:28.000
The best costume is the one that would have been culturally relevant three years ago.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
Let me hit you with one.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
Judge Lance Ito.

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
No, stay with me.

06:34.000 --> 06:39.000
What major cultural events happened this year that are going to be Halloween-ified?

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
I think we're smart enough to figure this out.

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
Because I think this isn't just shooting the shit anymore.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
This could be a practical business venture.

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
You can keep track of what is happening.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
You will wear a Jersey Shore costume.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
That's probably what it will be, right?

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
It will be Jersey Shore.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
No, Lady Gaga.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
Lady Gaga.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
But Lady Gaga, how do you do that?

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
She is a costume.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
You put some hula hoops around your waist.

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
Hula hoops made out of meat and human hair.

07:05.000 --> 07:10.000
Might I suggest going as three sexy podcast hosting brothers?

07:10.000 --> 07:14.000
Do my bim bam, but just use two mannequin heads.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
That's what I want.

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
That's basically the setup we have going on right now.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
That is basically, yeah.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
I am a puppet.

07:20.000 --> 07:24.000
I am Travis's puppet, and Griffin is my puppet that I am Travis.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
It's very confusing.

07:25.000 --> 07:29.000
I am currently in a situation I do not know how to handle.

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
I am falling for a married woman.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
Oh, sorry.

07:33.000 --> 07:39.000
Yes, the sinner is me, and I've embraced that already, but all signs point to her having

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
feelings for me too.

07:40.000 --> 07:44.000
She's mentioned how our marriage has been on the rocks several times because of him.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
What should I do?

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
That's lag from Gmail.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
Oh, that's a simple question.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
Don't do an effing thing.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
Not a thing.

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
Here's a good way to deal with this situation.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
You got to get out of it.

07:57.000 --> 08:02.000
You got to run far, run fast because I guarantee you.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
I guarantee you.

08:04.000 --> 08:12.000
That is the worst way to begin a relationship, the number one worst way, and lag.

08:12.000 --> 08:19.000
I don't know how to say this, but Dr. Phil says that if she will cheat on him to be with

08:19.000 --> 08:24.000
you, she will cheat on you to be with the cute pizza guy.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
That's just science.

08:26.000 --> 08:34.000
I have a test, and I call it the how did you meet mommy test, which is one day if you have

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
kids, they'll look up at you and say, how did you meet mommy?

08:37.000 --> 08:41.000
And your answer is, well, she was married to this other guy, and I totally made them

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
divorce.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
It's time for you to learn about it.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
It's time for you to learn about adultery.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
Yeah.

08:46.000 --> 08:52.000
Mommy wanted a taste of, you know how when you eat Froot Loops every morning, some mornings

08:52.000 --> 08:56.000
you wake up, and you want some Captain Crunch.

08:56.000 --> 09:03.000
Daddy was Captain Crunch for mommy, and I crunchetized her so hard.

09:03.000 --> 09:09.000
She put my figurative Crunch Berries in her mouth, and she bit down.

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
And then it turned into Oops All Berries.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
Yeah, and then you were born.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
Nine months later, you were born.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
Nine months later.

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
It was a miracle, really, a miracle.

09:18.000 --> 09:23.000
That's why we named you Rasp.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
What?

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
So what you need to do is do nothing, I said.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
Yeah, like don't do it.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
Don't do it.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
That fucking sucks, man.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
It sucks, lag.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
That sucks, dude.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
That's a sucky thing to do.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
It's just sucky, right?

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
That's the worst thing you can do.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
Something you can actualize.

09:36.000 --> 09:40.000
The world is trying to whittle me down, but I'm still a pretty romantic guy, but I don't

09:40.000 --> 09:45.000
think there's any situation where I can be like, oh man, I'm so crazy for that person.

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
I'm gonna break up their marriage.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
Yeah.

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
That goes against God's law.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
Yeah.

09:53.000 --> 09:56.800
Goes against state law, depending on what state you live in.

09:56.800 --> 10:00.000
I'm sure there are some states where adultery is illegal, right?

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
Like Utah.

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
Ah, see, I knew you were gonna go there.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
Yeah.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
So you want him to be a brother-husband.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
Oh no, brother-husband.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.080
Lag, you're better than that.

10:09.080 --> 10:10.080
You're not a brother-husband.

10:10.080 --> 10:12.740
Lag, let me give you a two, here's the thing.

10:12.740 --> 10:15.200
A lot of people won't tell you about jerking off.

10:15.200 --> 10:21.440
Jerking off is good, and it's healthy, it's natural, it's beautiful, it's human, right?

10:21.440 --> 10:22.440
Of course.

10:22.440 --> 10:28.720
But it also can, for the span of 15 to 20 minutes afterwards, give you superpowers.

10:28.720 --> 10:30.720
What do you mean, Justin?

10:30.720 --> 10:35.880
Well, first off, you can be supernaturally caring to your special someone.

10:35.880 --> 10:40.200
For 15 to 20 minutes, all you care about is them.

10:40.200 --> 10:43.200
You do not, you can be free of your sexual urges.

10:43.200 --> 10:46.600
It can also help you to weather the storms of temptation.

10:46.600 --> 10:48.200
Here's what you do, Lag.

10:48.200 --> 10:53.040
You jerk it, pick up a phone, tell her you're done.

10:53.040 --> 10:54.040
That's it.

10:54.040 --> 10:57.080
Tell her it can't happen, because Lag, that is the only time you will have the strength

10:57.080 --> 11:02.240
to do it, because if you can't do it then, then you are not in lust.

11:02.240 --> 11:04.600
You have genuine feelings for her.

11:04.600 --> 11:08.780
What you need to do is try to do that, and then you can tell it's not your wiener making

11:08.780 --> 11:10.720
the decisions for you.

11:10.720 --> 11:12.320
You need to master your bastion.

11:12.320 --> 11:13.320
What?

11:13.320 --> 11:14.320
And overcome it.

11:14.320 --> 11:15.320
What?

11:15.320 --> 11:16.320
Yes.

11:16.320 --> 11:18.640
Did, did, did Michael Jackson die, did Michael Jackson die this year?

11:18.640 --> 11:19.640
Or was that last year?

11:19.640 --> 11:20.640
Last year.

11:20.640 --> 11:21.640
Son of a bitch.

11:21.640 --> 11:27.400
I'm still thinking of Halloween costumes, and I thought that dead Michael Jackson might

11:27.400 --> 11:28.400
be one, but.

11:28.400 --> 11:32.040
Ditto, you got a, you got a yahoo answer for us?

11:32.040 --> 11:33.040
I sure do.

11:33.040 --> 11:36.560
This one was sent in to us by Bug42.

11:36.560 --> 11:40.280
I wanted to actually save it for later in the show, but it's, it's like a beautiful

11:40.280 --> 11:44.440
present that, and I know it's inside of it already, and I want to share it with the world,

11:44.440 --> 11:46.760
so it's not like a present at all.

11:46.760 --> 11:48.880
But it was sent in by Bug42, thank you Bug42.

11:48.880 --> 11:53.540
It's a question by Kevin K. O. Arsenalista.

11:53.540 --> 11:57.720
That's his moniker on the internet.

11:57.720 --> 12:05.240
He asks, can your baby get pregnant if you have sex while pregnant?

12:05.240 --> 12:16.240
Like, the baby is a girl, and you have sex, and the sperm goos to her while in the womb.

12:16.240 --> 12:21.000
I'm imagining like a Russian doll situation, like, the answer is obviously yes.

12:21.000 --> 12:25.040
Like when you cut open a shark, and there's a baby in the shark, and then there's a shark

12:25.040 --> 12:26.040
baby inside.

12:26.040 --> 12:31.480
Person inside of person inside of person inside of person, uh, ad infinitum.

12:31.480 --> 12:33.480
That's when it gets tricky.

12:33.480 --> 12:39.520
It's the fifth baby in there that gets a problem, like, you know, you get your, your significant

12:39.520 --> 12:43.560
other pregnant, and then you get that baby pregnant, and then you get that baby pregnant,

12:43.560 --> 12:47.640
then you get that baby pregnant, but then you're getting down to that tiny little baby

12:47.640 --> 12:48.640
in the middle.

12:48.640 --> 12:52.960
You go to your wife and you say, why does my baby's baby baby look nothing like me?

12:52.960 --> 12:57.960
And she's like, hold on, I have to get a chart out, because I cannot honestly answer you.

12:57.960 --> 13:01.240
There is, there are too many layers of abstraction here.

13:01.240 --> 13:06.440
Can we also address, like, his, his concept is, of course, delightful.

13:06.440 --> 13:11.080
Can we address his use of goos as a verb?

13:11.080 --> 13:16.240
I think he misspelled goes, but I mean, I guess it works either way.

13:16.240 --> 13:17.240
Yeah, it does.

13:17.240 --> 13:18.240
Right?

13:18.240 --> 13:21.960
Like in this specific case, it just goes into the baby.

13:21.960 --> 13:26.880
Well, when it gets, when it gets tricky is, yeah, if it's a girl baby, she gets pregnant.

13:26.880 --> 13:31.200
But if it's a guy baby, once you break that chain, once you break that chain, you can't,

13:31.200 --> 13:34.600
you can't make any more humans.

13:34.600 --> 13:38.240
What you what you should do, what you do is try and time out all the pregnancy so that

13:38.240 --> 13:43.600
the due dates fall within like the same time so that you could get like a, like a chain

13:43.600 --> 13:52.000
of of births like a like a charm bracelet thing going on like a charm bracelet of human

13:52.000 --> 13:55.000
beings.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
I am.

13:57.000 --> 14:00.720
I don't think that babies can get pregnant to answer your question.

14:00.720 --> 14:02.920
No, you have to be at least seven.

14:02.920 --> 14:08.400
That's when I think that's when you become fertile.

14:08.400 --> 14:10.760
This is from Terry.

14:10.760 --> 14:15.880
Terry asks, I have an OK job at the moment, but a job I have wanted for a long time has

14:15.880 --> 14:16.880
come up.

14:16.880 --> 14:21.680
And in order to apply for this new job, I may need to get myself in some serious trouble

14:21.680 --> 14:23.160
at my current job.

14:23.160 --> 14:24.680
Do you think it's worth risking?

14:24.680 --> 14:31.720
Terry, do you mean that like you're going to have to get into some shenanigans or like

14:31.720 --> 14:36.400
in order to get fired, you've got to get such monkey shines that you can get removed from

14:36.400 --> 14:37.400
this current job?

14:37.400 --> 14:38.400
Like, what's the.

14:38.400 --> 14:43.760
Well, I've got a really good, but the only way to get in is to break into my current

14:43.760 --> 14:44.760
job.

14:44.760 --> 14:45.760
Right.

14:45.760 --> 14:46.760
I've got this great goof.

14:46.760 --> 14:47.760
You guys want to hear my goof?

14:47.760 --> 14:48.760
Yeah.

14:48.760 --> 14:49.760
Let me hear the goof.

14:49.760 --> 14:53.840
Here's what you do while you're at work, while you're working, you're at your desk, right?

14:53.840 --> 14:57.440
And you're, you know, doing whatever it is that you do, OK?

14:57.440 --> 15:04.920
You stand up, OK, and you go in your boss's office and you say, I don't want to work here

15:04.920 --> 15:05.920
anymore.

15:05.920 --> 15:06.920
Wait a minute.

15:06.920 --> 15:07.920
I love it.

15:07.920 --> 15:08.920
Wait a minute.

15:08.920 --> 15:09.920
Wait a minute.

15:09.920 --> 15:10.920
Wait a minute.

15:10.920 --> 15:14.320
I think what he said, he doesn't have a guarantee.

15:14.320 --> 15:19.120
So like, I think then why does he want to get in trouble at his job if he doesn't have

15:19.120 --> 15:20.120
a guarantee?

15:20.120 --> 15:25.240
How bad are you at secrets that your job needs, your job one needs to find out that you're

15:25.240 --> 15:26.480
applying for job two?

15:26.480 --> 15:29.240
Like, are you just so terrified that you're going to pay boss?

15:29.240 --> 15:30.400
I need to leave early today.

15:30.400 --> 15:31.400
I'm dying.

15:31.400 --> 15:35.680
I mean, I, my grandfather is applying for it.

15:35.680 --> 15:36.680
Damn it.

15:36.680 --> 15:38.280
I got hit by a baby.

15:38.280 --> 15:44.000
OK, I've reread the question now, and I think what's going on is that the company he wants

15:44.000 --> 15:48.280
to work at is a competitor to the company he's currently working at.

15:48.280 --> 15:50.840
So they want him to, like, steal company secrets.

15:50.840 --> 15:53.400
Oh shit, espionage.

15:53.400 --> 15:55.040
I think there's some corporate espionage going on.

15:55.040 --> 15:56.040
I've been waiting for-

15:56.040 --> 15:57.040
We don't want none of that shit.

15:57.040 --> 15:59.600
24 episodes to get an espionage question.

15:59.600 --> 16:02.200
And just to tell you that we're having enough of it.

16:02.200 --> 16:08.480
We will, we will allow babies to get pregnant by other babies' intercourse before we allow

16:08.480 --> 16:12.240
espionage to be discussed on this program.

16:12.240 --> 16:16.200
If there's one thing that really drives me off the wall, it's spies.

16:16.200 --> 16:17.280
Spies?

16:17.280 --> 16:18.280
We did have-

16:18.280 --> 16:19.280
Ooh, spies.

16:19.280 --> 16:21.400
We had a question about marital espionage earlier.

16:21.400 --> 16:22.400
Does that count?

16:22.400 --> 16:23.400
Is that, is that-

16:23.400 --> 16:24.400
No.

16:24.400 --> 16:25.400
Yes.

16:25.400 --> 16:26.400
Yeah.

16:26.400 --> 16:27.400
That totally works.

16:27.400 --> 16:28.400
Yeah.

16:28.400 --> 16:29.400
Subterfuge, I'm OK with.

16:29.400 --> 16:30.400
It's corporate espionage.

16:30.400 --> 16:31.660
Haven't corporations been through enough?

16:31.660 --> 16:33.360
Look at the economy.

16:33.360 --> 16:38.400
Haven't these corporate, these poor businesses been through enough that you're going to subject

16:38.400 --> 16:40.360
them to espionage, Terry?

16:40.360 --> 16:41.780
A2, Terry?

16:41.780 --> 16:43.560
After all the paychecks they've given you?

16:43.560 --> 16:48.120
After that nice cake that Carla from Accounting got you for your birthday?

16:48.120 --> 16:49.120
Gross, Terry.

16:49.120 --> 16:50.120
Gross.

16:50.120 --> 16:51.120
Robocop.

16:51.120 --> 16:52.120
Robocop?

16:52.120 --> 16:57.680
I know there hasn't been a Robocop movie in a long, long time, but I think the Robocop

16:57.680 --> 17:03.240
students have a comeback where you just show up dressed as Robocop and people will be like,

17:03.240 --> 17:06.080
oh shit, I've never seen anybody in a Robocop outfit.

17:06.080 --> 17:07.080
Form Spring Axe.

17:07.080 --> 17:13.000
Dear Mabim Bam, what do you think is the best way to ease relationship insecurities?

17:13.000 --> 17:16.760
I'm in a long-term relationship and give it my all, but I feel like I'm not good enough

17:16.760 --> 17:20.640
for my successful boyfriend and I don't want to bother him with my petty issues.

17:20.640 --> 17:21.640
Ooh.

17:21.640 --> 17:22.640
This is an intruder.

17:22.640 --> 17:25.920
So you're dealing with your own insecurities, not his.

17:25.920 --> 17:26.920
Right.

17:26.920 --> 17:33.000
She is insecure in the relationship because she thinks the boyfriend is too good for her.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.680
You can't let that kind of thing seep into your head.

17:35.680 --> 17:43.160
You gotta, you gotta overcome that because that is sort of a self-defeating, self-defeating

17:43.160 --> 17:44.160
thing.

17:44.160 --> 17:48.160
And I guess that's what you're trying to do and you're turning to us for it.

17:48.160 --> 17:50.800
Let me, let me give you some, an upside here.

17:50.800 --> 17:56.460
And while it might not seem like it, I think you're in a win-win situation where I think

17:56.460 --> 18:01.600
a good way to get over it is to express these insecurities with your boyfriend and say,

18:01.600 --> 18:02.880
I want to talk about these.

18:02.880 --> 18:04.600
I know these are issues.

18:04.600 --> 18:09.200
And if he doesn't want to listen, hey, your insecurities are totally justified.

18:09.200 --> 18:11.400
And then you get to deal with that.

18:11.400 --> 18:15.200
You realize like halfway through your answer that it wasn't an answer really.

18:15.200 --> 18:16.200
Right.

18:16.200 --> 18:20.840
I realized like, oh, this isn't as positive as I thought it was going to be.

18:20.840 --> 18:23.080
Just, you know, find something on the side.

18:23.080 --> 18:28.160
Just get a little side dude going, get a little side dude action because he will give you

18:28.160 --> 18:34.640
all of the, the attention and all of the, you know, positive reinforcement that you

18:34.640 --> 18:35.640
need.

18:35.640 --> 18:36.640
You need a side dude.

18:36.640 --> 18:37.640
And it's not cheating.

18:37.640 --> 18:38.640
It's not cheating.

18:38.640 --> 18:39.640
If you do it for those reasons.

18:39.640 --> 18:44.000
Listen, if Mr. Success, you want to knock him down a few pegs, that's how you do it.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.400
Let him, that'll be your secret.

18:46.400 --> 18:50.280
That's your success that you keep from him.

18:50.280 --> 18:54.160
Did we just discover the reason why people cheat on their significant others?

18:54.160 --> 18:55.160
It's gotta be one of them.

18:55.160 --> 18:58.400
The other one is if the person is immensely physically attractive.

18:58.400 --> 18:59.400
Just super, super.

18:59.400 --> 19:00.400
So hot.

19:00.400 --> 19:01.400
So hot.

19:01.400 --> 19:02.400
So hot.

19:02.400 --> 19:03.400
Yes.

19:03.400 --> 19:06.480
I don't care about my insecurities anymore.

19:06.480 --> 19:10.720
You are bringing me such pleasure because of your physical attractiveness and your sexual

19:10.720 --> 19:13.200
prowess that this is worth it.

19:13.200 --> 19:19.440
I hate to, I hate to keep interrupting, but, um, Paul Bart mall cop, did that come out

19:19.440 --> 19:21.400
this year or was that last year?

19:21.400 --> 19:25.360
I believe that was Paul Blart was, I'm not kidding.

19:25.360 --> 19:30.240
I think Paul Blart mall cop would be a pretty, I might actually, how about Paul Blart Robocop?

19:30.240 --> 19:35.120
Whoa, did you not watch the movie Travis?

19:35.120 --> 19:40.560
Around the halfway point during the, the, the ascending action of that movie is he gets

19:40.560 --> 19:44.520
cut in half by one of those gates that they use to lock down stores.

19:44.520 --> 19:45.920
So they have to give him robot legs.

19:45.920 --> 19:48.220
So from the, actually it was a segue.

19:48.220 --> 19:51.440
His bottom half became a segue and his top half was Kevin Smith.

19:51.440 --> 19:54.080
And it was so fucking funny.

19:54.080 --> 19:59.480
It was a, it was a rough, rough surgery and they had to get a hat, a torso donation from

19:59.480 --> 20:08.480
Kevin Smith and, uh, Kevin James is dead.

20:08.480 --> 20:17.400
So like the segues underneath his long coat and, uh, Paul Blart mall rat, thank you monster.

20:17.400 --> 20:19.320
What?

20:19.320 --> 20:24.600
It seems like with all of the people I know in a relationship, the guy is usually four

20:24.600 --> 20:29.960
to 10 years older than their GF and any girls I meet who are relatively close to my age

20:29.960 --> 20:34.720
seem to be interested in older guys, 22, not particularly interested in dating 18 year

20:34.720 --> 20:35.720
olds.

20:35.720 --> 20:40.480
One of the youngest within my group of college friends by a few years, wait, really?

20:40.480 --> 20:41.480
Okay.

20:41.480 --> 20:44.560
And most people think I'm 18 or 19.

20:44.560 --> 20:47.900
My question, who are these dummies are going to college?

20:47.900 --> 20:51.680
My question is, should I keep trying to meet girls my age knowing they probably won't want

20:51.680 --> 20:56.640
to talk with me or jump on the bandwagon and be that guy who's always hitting on 18 year

20:56.640 --> 20:57.640
old girls?

20:57.640 --> 20:58.640
Nate, that's great.

20:58.640 --> 20:59.720
Well, stop, hold it.

20:59.720 --> 21:03.280
Stop hanging out with old Mr. Jankins, the groundskeeper.

21:03.280 --> 21:06.400
But he's clearly laid out the only two options he has.

21:06.400 --> 21:11.600
All joking aside, like be lonely, uh, because everyone else, all of your peers are grooving

21:11.600 --> 21:19.360
on the 28 to 34 year olds, uh, or, or, you know, be with an 18 year old because what

21:19.360 --> 21:23.080
was great, what was great is when you were 18 years old, you couldn't date an 18 year

21:23.080 --> 21:25.480
old because they were all dating 22 year olds.

21:25.480 --> 21:28.160
It's a circle of life.

21:28.160 --> 21:30.920
It's a wheel of boning.

21:30.920 --> 21:35.820
I could try to be really uppity right now, but man, I pretty much only dated freshmen

21:35.820 --> 21:36.820
in college.

21:36.820 --> 21:38.780
So that's my advice.

21:38.780 --> 21:39.780
It's awesome.

21:39.780 --> 21:44.640
Uh, you know, Nate, you are, you have got to get over the age thing.

21:44.640 --> 21:52.000
You the, I swear to God, I'm a 59 years old and by the time you get to be my age, you

21:52.000 --> 21:55.120
will never think about how old somebody is.

21:55.120 --> 22:01.080
Like, okay, you're 22, you're hitting on 18 year old, gross, yucky, whatever.

22:01.080 --> 22:04.240
You're 70 and you're married to a 66 year old.

22:04.240 --> 22:05.240
Like really?

22:05.240 --> 22:06.240
That's, that's nothing.

22:06.240 --> 22:07.240
That's, it's, it's infinitesimal.

22:07.240 --> 22:12.440
How about this, you're three, you're three and a half and you're hitting on sperm.

22:12.440 --> 22:13.440
Whoa.

22:13.440 --> 22:18.600
And that's, that's, that's the worst is it's a pregnant sperm.

22:18.600 --> 22:22.960
So you got the stigma too from your parents.

22:22.960 --> 22:26.840
You're dead and she's 88 and you're still dating.

22:26.840 --> 22:27.840
Yeah.

22:27.840 --> 22:31.920
Um, why, why don't you, I'm going to date someone your own age.

22:31.920 --> 22:36.560
I guess it's not, it's not, what kind of strict rules does your campus have?

22:36.560 --> 22:41.240
I'm so uncool now, apparently I do not know the things that are going on.

22:41.240 --> 22:44.760
I think when you're fresh out of college, when you're fresh out of college or you're

22:44.760 --> 22:48.500
near in the end of college, you don't want to date people in college anymore.

22:48.500 --> 22:52.120
You want to date people who have already, you know, made it because that's who you want

22:52.120 --> 22:53.120
to be.

22:53.120 --> 22:55.680
When you date the kind of person that you want to be.

22:55.680 --> 23:01.000
I would only want to date people in college so I could drink in their naivete like a sweet

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
elixir.

23:02.000 --> 23:05.320
Oh God, they're so optimistic about the future and what it holds.

23:05.320 --> 23:09.680
They're so happy not being in high school anymore.

23:09.680 --> 23:11.640
That's me drinking in their positivity.

23:11.640 --> 23:12.640
Yum.

23:12.640 --> 23:13.640
Yum.

23:13.640 --> 23:14.640
It's, it's delicious.

23:14.640 --> 23:17.040
It tastes like sunshine, like liquid sunshine.

23:17.040 --> 23:18.720
How about a Yahoo answers question?

23:18.720 --> 23:19.720
Yes.

23:19.720 --> 23:20.720
Do it.

23:20.720 --> 23:23.840
This one was sent in by Cal.

23:23.840 --> 23:26.800
The question is, oh man, it's so great.

23:26.800 --> 23:27.800
I didn't read his name before.

23:27.800 --> 23:30.720
It's from A1 Magician.

23:30.720 --> 23:37.880
A1 Magician asks, appropriate to his name, in performing street magic, what is the best

23:37.880 --> 23:41.040
way to open a conversation and starting a performance?

23:41.040 --> 23:43.720
I really want to do some street magic to some bystanders.

23:43.720 --> 23:46.640
He wants to do magic to people.

23:46.640 --> 23:53.800
I'm glad he's established already that magic is in fact something you do to people.

23:53.800 --> 23:59.040
I want to do some street magic to some bystanders, customers in a restaurant and et cetera, but

23:59.040 --> 24:03.240
I could not seem to find the right words to open or engage in a conversation leading to

24:03.240 --> 24:06.720
me performing magic.

24:06.720 --> 24:11.000
I got, okay, here's, here's a few helpful suggestions from your friends at My Brother

24:11.000 --> 24:12.000
and My Brother and Me.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.120
Hey, do you guys want to see some magic?

24:14.120 --> 24:15.120
Okay, that's-

24:15.120 --> 24:16.720
Hey, who here likes magic?

24:16.720 --> 24:17.720
That's a good one.

24:17.720 --> 24:18.720
That's a pretty good one.

24:18.720 --> 24:23.080
Are you, uh, are you stupid enough to be taken in by simple illusions?

24:23.080 --> 24:26.200
Hey, you look gullible, check this shit out.

24:26.200 --> 24:29.000
Hey, let me see your iPhone for a second.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.480
Can I borrow a quarter?

24:30.480 --> 24:31.480
Hey, I've been on-

24:31.480 --> 24:32.480
I need to get on a bus.

24:32.480 --> 24:34.000
I've been on my own for too long.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.480
Here's what comes, here's what comes of that.

24:36.480 --> 24:41.720
I don't think there is a good way to open a conversation for street magic.

24:41.720 --> 24:46.080
The thing is street, that's why street magic is so intriguing, right?

24:46.080 --> 24:49.560
Because theater magic, people have paid to come to see you.

24:49.560 --> 24:53.520
They are doing viewership to your magic as opposed to the opposite.

24:53.520 --> 24:54.920
You're doing your magic to them.

24:54.920 --> 25:01.720
I am personally terrified of the idea that I could just be walking around in my day-to-day

25:01.720 --> 25:05.240
and someone could just magic me like out of nowhere with no permission.

25:05.240 --> 25:06.240
Hey, excuse me.

25:06.240 --> 25:07.240
Can I stop you for a moment?

25:07.240 --> 25:08.240
I want to do some magic.

25:08.240 --> 25:10.480
No, I would like, I would prefer you not.

25:10.480 --> 25:11.480
I am going to the mall.

25:11.480 --> 25:14.480
No, just let me, just, just give me a moment to do some magic to you.

25:14.480 --> 25:15.480
You're going to love it.

25:15.480 --> 25:20.520
When I'm walking, when I'm walking down the busy bustling streets of Chicago, there are

25:20.520 --> 25:22.680
two things that I'm on Vigilant Watch for.

25:22.680 --> 25:26.940
And by Vigilant Watch, I mean, I keep them in my periphery, but I don't like look directly

25:26.940 --> 25:31.800
at them because I don't want to engage them and is the homeless.

25:31.800 --> 25:36.040
And of course, street magicians are people who I assume to be street magicians.

25:36.040 --> 25:40.520
If there was a homeless person that came up to do street magic to me, I would, I would,

25:40.520 --> 25:41.520
I would explode.

25:41.520 --> 25:42.520
I would not know.

25:42.520 --> 25:46.560
What if one bum rushed you and said, Hey, I bet you thought I was going to do some street

25:46.560 --> 25:47.560
magic.

25:47.560 --> 25:49.020
Well, you, you may already be psychic.

25:49.020 --> 25:52.760
I should watch you do a trick and then street magic just like that.

25:52.760 --> 25:54.480
Travis, you did some street magic, right?

25:54.480 --> 25:59.840
You were, I remember you were into street magic and you had conversations about getting

25:59.840 --> 26:00.840
into street magic.

26:00.840 --> 26:01.840
Did I make that up?

26:01.840 --> 26:06.120
I dabbled, I dabbled in Prestidigitation.

26:06.120 --> 26:07.120
What is it?

26:07.120 --> 26:09.480
What if, what if you didn't start it?

26:09.480 --> 26:11.760
Maybe you had them ask you to do magic.

26:11.760 --> 26:13.620
So, so let me hit you with this.

26:13.620 --> 26:18.280
You stumble out of a theater and you have like a magician's costume on, but you're,

26:18.280 --> 26:24.200
the elbows are kind of ratty and you're crying and just fall down the streets and sob.

26:24.200 --> 26:27.280
And when someone asks you what's wrong, they say, they say my magic wasn't good enough.

26:27.280 --> 26:31.080
They said, no one would want to want to see my old stupid tricks.

26:31.080 --> 26:35.280
And then you get them to be like, uh, I'm sure that's not true.

26:35.280 --> 26:37.140
And you'd be like, Oh fuck, it's on.

26:37.140 --> 26:40.160
Let's get some magic, open your mouth.

26:40.160 --> 26:43.680
I'm putting wonder in it.

26:43.680 --> 26:45.120
Maybe not that so much.

26:45.120 --> 26:46.120
Open your mouth.

26:46.120 --> 26:49.920
I'm trying to put some wonder in you.

26:49.920 --> 26:52.640
Oh God.

26:52.640 --> 26:57.160
I did just come up with a really great street magic routine where you are the, the bum who's

26:57.160 --> 27:01.080
like asking for money, but everything you asked for is, is part of the trick.

27:01.080 --> 27:02.560
You're like, can I borrow a quarter?

27:02.560 --> 27:03.720
And like, I don't have a quarter.

27:03.720 --> 27:05.980
And like, Oh, then what's that behind your ear?

27:05.980 --> 27:10.480
I think you're legitimately developing street magician routines now.

27:10.480 --> 27:14.640
If there's ever been a sure sign that it's time to move on, I think this is it.

27:14.640 --> 27:21.080
I can't, this is from Chris, uh, via Gmail says I can't seem to get my wife's attention.

27:21.080 --> 27:22.080
We both work.

27:22.080 --> 27:24.680
That's what I hear when someone uses an exclamation point.

27:24.680 --> 27:27.560
We both work fast paced jobs, long hours and long commutes.

27:27.560 --> 27:30.640
We're either going full speed or pass out from exhaustion.

27:30.640 --> 27:32.680
We tend to buzz right by each other on most days.

27:32.680 --> 27:36.120
My question is, how can I get her to slow down and start hanging out more?

27:36.120 --> 27:38.160
I'd like to do something special.

27:38.160 --> 27:40.240
So I figured I'd solicit some expert advice from you guys.

27:40.240 --> 27:43.640
As a side note, Molly, my wife is a loyal listener, so she should be listening right

27:43.640 --> 27:44.640
now.

27:44.640 --> 27:49.520
Assuming you get to my question, maybe a plea directly to her would do the trick.

27:49.520 --> 27:52.080
The NBNB AM wedding proposal was a home run.

27:52.080 --> 28:00.880
Can you spray a little magic for us, Chris, Chris, magic to you, Chris, say, Hey, Molly,

28:00.880 --> 28:04.160
can I do some magic to you?

28:04.160 --> 28:05.400
And she'll be so intrigued.

28:05.400 --> 28:07.960
I think that you've got her for at least 30 minutes.

28:07.960 --> 28:08.960
What day is it today?

28:08.960 --> 28:09.960
It's, it's Monday, right?

28:09.960 --> 28:11.400
That's the day that the shows go up.

28:11.400 --> 28:12.400
Yeah.

28:12.400 --> 28:18.720
But you guys need to arrange a date night on this coming Thursday, 8 p.m.

28:18.720 --> 28:22.360
You'll go out, you'll get a bite to eat at your favorite dining spot.

28:22.360 --> 28:29.840
And then at 10 p.m., go see a film, go see the social network and sit in the back and

28:29.840 --> 28:31.680
neck, just neck the whole time.

28:31.680 --> 28:32.680
Don't even watch the movie.

28:32.680 --> 28:33.680
Just neck.

28:33.680 --> 28:34.680
Real noisy.

28:34.680 --> 28:35.680
Well, then go see a bad movie then.

28:35.680 --> 28:36.680
It's supposed to be terrible.

28:36.680 --> 28:41.800
Go see Paul Bokmulkop, the show at the Dollar Theater.

28:41.800 --> 28:46.520
You know, this is, this is tough because when, I mean, I'm married to a doctor, so she's,

28:46.520 --> 28:47.520
she's kind of busy.

28:47.520 --> 28:48.520
Always bragging.

28:48.520 --> 28:49.520
Always bragging.

28:49.520 --> 28:51.440
Always bragging about that.

28:51.440 --> 28:59.920
I think you should, I don't see that she's not going to resent you asking her to slow

28:59.920 --> 29:01.440
down and spend their time with you.

29:01.440 --> 29:03.880
Like, do you know who does that?

29:03.880 --> 29:04.880
Babies.

29:04.880 --> 29:05.880
Like, literal babies.

29:05.880 --> 29:07.520
And especially pregnant babies.

29:07.520 --> 29:10.040
God, you want to hear a complainer.

29:10.040 --> 29:13.160
Can't, can't speak, but you know she's bitching at you.

29:13.160 --> 29:15.160
God, pregnant babies.

29:15.160 --> 29:20.800
The thing to do, my suggestion at least, would, hey, maybe get a little more comfortable with

29:20.800 --> 29:21.800
you time.

29:21.800 --> 29:23.680
Oh, Chris time, eh?

29:23.680 --> 29:24.680
Don't mind if I do.

29:24.680 --> 29:28.560
Let me open up a can of Chris time where I drink the beverages I want to drink and watch

29:28.560 --> 29:32.200
what I want to watch on TV.

29:32.200 --> 29:35.360
But that's, I think set up a bear trap.

29:35.360 --> 29:42.880
See, bear traps are cruel and unusual, but some sort of, um, uh, snare.

29:42.880 --> 29:43.880
Some sort of snare.

29:43.880 --> 29:44.880
Oh, a snare.

29:44.880 --> 29:45.880
That hurt.

29:45.880 --> 29:46.880
You know what I've always wanted?

29:46.880 --> 29:50.640
One where you bend the tree over way far and then you leave it on the ground.

29:50.640 --> 29:53.160
But that will kill, that will kill her, which.

29:53.160 --> 29:54.720
Wait, no, no, it won't.

29:54.720 --> 29:57.400
It'll just grab her up by her foot.

29:57.400 --> 30:00.240
And I was like, not one of the ones that flings her across the yard.

30:00.240 --> 30:01.240
Right.

30:01.240 --> 30:02.520
That's the one that I was thinking of.

30:02.520 --> 30:06.720
How about, um, a tiger pit?

30:06.720 --> 30:10.680
This tiger pit, a tiger pit might be hard to pull off in your house.

30:10.680 --> 30:12.040
Don't put the spikes.

30:12.040 --> 30:13.480
Don't put the spikes in there though.

30:13.480 --> 30:18.960
This is a family friendly mistake, but if you have a rug, a large conspicuous rug in

30:18.960 --> 30:21.880
your house, just put a tiger pit down there.

30:21.880 --> 30:26.200
Maybe you could clear like 30 minutes in your own schedule to think about the fact that

30:26.200 --> 30:32.080
your wife makes time for us, but not you.

30:32.080 --> 30:35.360
Well, that could be something you do in your spare time.

30:35.360 --> 30:38.680
Maybe she, maybe she like listens to us on the commute.

30:38.680 --> 30:43.200
Um, but, but this idea is worth looking into if she, if she does listen to us on a commute,

30:43.200 --> 30:44.880
maybe you should do your own podcast.

30:44.880 --> 30:48.600
Uh, but the podcast isn't you giving advice to people who desperately need it as much

30:48.600 --> 30:53.640
as it is, um, you just talking about your wife, talking about how much you love your

30:53.640 --> 30:58.960
wife, all the things that you do, uh, in the day that your wife doesn't know about, but

30:58.960 --> 31:05.160
you know, should know about, um, and we can call it molly talk, molly talk.

31:05.160 --> 31:12.760
If you need some tips, poor Chris, Chris, Chris riffs, Chris riffs, ludicrous.

31:12.760 --> 31:14.400
I I've got nothing.

31:14.400 --> 31:16.120
Saddest podcast ever.

31:16.120 --> 31:18.080
Kind of a sad, kind of a bummer.

31:18.080 --> 31:19.640
Hey hun, how's your day?

31:19.640 --> 31:22.800
Um, I like, Hey hun, how's your day?

31:22.800 --> 31:26.760
Can we change the name of our podcast to Hey hun, how's your day?

31:26.760 --> 31:32.920
Uh, I am a girl living with a guy who I have been friends with for a while.

31:32.920 --> 31:37.200
My other friends and I have always had a sneaking suspicion that he might be gay and I think

31:37.200 --> 31:39.080
if he came out, he would be much happier.

31:39.080 --> 31:40.560
Is there an easy way to have this talk?

31:40.560 --> 31:41.560
Thanks.

31:41.560 --> 31:42.560
Mom's pregnant.

31:42.560 --> 31:43.560
Are you sure?

31:43.560 --> 31:47.560
Are you sure he's 100% sure?

31:47.560 --> 31:50.140
That's so important.

31:50.140 --> 31:53.360
Is it possible you just really want him to be gay?

31:53.360 --> 31:54.880
Hey, yeah.

31:54.880 --> 31:57.120
Do you just want a gay friend?

31:57.120 --> 32:03.000
I get it, but I, I think it would be easier for us to advise if we knew some more about

32:03.000 --> 32:04.000
the dude.

32:04.000 --> 32:10.680
Cause there is a lot of things that can be perceived to, to be, um, gay traits, uh, that,

32:10.680 --> 32:17.280
that aren't aren't simply aren't, um, maybe he enjoys top chef, but Justin, you enjoy

32:17.280 --> 32:18.280
top chef.

32:18.280 --> 32:23.080
Um, are you, are you like, does he wear men's fashion scarves?

32:23.080 --> 32:24.260
Oh, scarves.

32:24.260 --> 32:25.260
That could go either way.

32:25.260 --> 32:26.260
I see.

32:26.260 --> 32:27.260
I wear scarves.

32:27.260 --> 32:28.260
Hell.

32:28.260 --> 32:29.260
Maybe he goes either way.

32:29.260 --> 32:30.260
It's hard to say.

32:30.260 --> 32:31.920
And that, that would be a whole different discussion.

32:31.920 --> 32:37.640
I think if he wanted, if you wanted to talk about it, like I think he would probably discuss

32:37.640 --> 32:38.640
it with you.

32:38.640 --> 32:44.720
He would probably be more comfortable living with you if all the cards were on the table.

32:44.720 --> 32:47.440
Um, which you can take one of two ways.

32:47.440 --> 32:52.960
Either a, he doesn't want to talk about it or b, he's not gay.

32:52.960 --> 32:55.960
I really don't know how you don't know this already.

32:55.960 --> 32:59.920
Like how, cause if you don't know he's gay at this point, you've been living with him,

32:59.920 --> 33:03.360
then he is not, at least not out of the closet gay.

33:03.360 --> 33:04.860
Like wouldn't you think?

33:04.860 --> 33:09.840
I think, I think coming out of the closet is such a big deal because this is, you can't

33:09.840 --> 33:11.480
approach it like this.

33:11.480 --> 33:14.440
I think it's such a big deal because nobody can do it but you.

33:14.440 --> 33:15.440
And let me throw something out.

33:15.440 --> 33:16.860
Like nobody can be like, Hey, it's cool.

33:16.860 --> 33:18.000
It's time to come on out.

33:18.000 --> 33:19.000
Come on out here.

33:19.000 --> 33:20.000
We have candy.

33:20.000 --> 33:21.480
Um, I'm going to throw out.

33:21.480 --> 33:23.080
It's none of your business.

33:23.080 --> 33:28.520
Um, well, I'm going to put a little bit nicer, a little bit nicer, since you're a listener

33:28.520 --> 33:35.480
to our mind your own goddamn selfish bitch.

33:35.480 --> 33:37.560
Why is it so important to you?

33:37.560 --> 33:39.120
I think is, is another way of looking at it.

33:39.120 --> 33:40.680
You like your relationship with him, right?

33:40.680 --> 33:43.280
You don't want to put any undue stress on it, right?

33:43.280 --> 33:44.520
Just let it go.

33:44.520 --> 33:46.240
Maybe he's secret gay.

33:46.240 --> 33:47.240
Maybe he's not.

33:47.240 --> 33:51.480
Maybe it's that, maybe it's that, that mystery that keeps your relationship going.

33:51.480 --> 33:52.840
Who knows?

33:52.840 --> 33:56.360
Maybe he's been acting gay so he can secret look at you, look at you in the shower and

33:56.360 --> 33:57.720
you never suspect it.

33:57.720 --> 33:59.080
Oh, whoa, whoa.

33:59.080 --> 34:00.400
Blew your mind.

34:00.400 --> 34:01.400
Just let him be.

34:01.400 --> 34:02.400
Let it be him.

34:02.400 --> 34:07.840
Like a beautiful, beautiful butterfly that may or may not be gay.

34:07.840 --> 34:08.840
Also come on to him.

34:08.840 --> 34:09.840
Yeah.

34:09.840 --> 34:10.840
Oh yeah.

34:10.840 --> 34:11.840
Sure fire.

34:11.840 --> 34:13.880
Show him your boobs and then say, Hey, let's see that boner.

34:13.880 --> 34:17.840
I want to see it, I want to see it, I want to see it, boner check, boner check, boner

34:17.840 --> 34:18.840
test.

34:18.840 --> 34:19.840
Quick.

34:19.840 --> 34:20.840
Quick.

34:20.840 --> 34:21.840
You failed.

34:21.840 --> 34:22.840
You failed gay.

34:22.840 --> 34:23.840
You don't want this gay.

34:23.840 --> 34:24.840
You don't want this body.

34:24.840 --> 34:25.840
This banging.

34:25.840 --> 34:28.560
You must be gay if you don't like this.

34:28.560 --> 34:29.560
Me.

34:29.560 --> 34:30.560
I have.

34:30.560 --> 34:32.600
Why don't you go fuck a guy?

34:32.600 --> 34:33.600
You don't want this body.

34:33.600 --> 34:34.600
Gay.

34:34.600 --> 34:35.600
Gay.

34:35.600 --> 34:36.600
Gay.

34:36.600 --> 34:43.520
There is literally no thing that you can do in this situation that is not going to

34:43.520 --> 34:44.520
be terrible.

34:44.520 --> 34:45.520
Hey.

34:45.520 --> 34:46.520
Sit on your hands.

34:46.520 --> 34:47.520
Go to bed.

34:47.520 --> 34:48.520
Either you.

34:48.520 --> 34:49.520
You want these jugs or you want dudes.

34:49.520 --> 34:50.520
The dudes on your face.

34:50.520 --> 34:51.520
Make up your mind.

34:51.520 --> 34:59.520
Do you want to kiss a man on the face or are you going to kiss these jugs right on him?

34:59.520 --> 35:04.160
Say jugs as much as possible because there's nothing sexier than that.

35:04.160 --> 35:05.160
Nothing sexier than that.

35:05.160 --> 35:09.040
I would suggest calling his mom.

35:09.040 --> 35:13.880
Hey, do you know your son's gay?

35:13.880 --> 35:14.880
Judge from her reaction.

35:14.880 --> 35:15.880
No.

35:15.880 --> 35:16.880
All right.

35:16.880 --> 35:19.120
In all seriousness, don't stir up this.

35:19.120 --> 35:20.120
Don't be high.

35:20.120 --> 35:21.120
Don't do anything.

35:21.120 --> 35:22.120
Hook him out when he's ready.

35:22.120 --> 35:28.920
Find some ways to say, like, right now, you know, there's a lot of issues that pertain

35:28.920 --> 35:31.080
to the gay and lesbian community right now in the news.

35:31.080 --> 35:36.340
Maybe find some way to express your support of the homosexual lifestyle so he feels comfortable

35:36.340 --> 35:38.000
talking to you about it.

35:38.000 --> 35:41.240
But otherwise, don't force it because it's not going to be good for your life.

35:41.240 --> 35:47.360
If you really want him to be comfortable talking about it and if he is to come out to you,

35:47.360 --> 35:48.960
then you need to drop it.

35:48.960 --> 35:50.800
You need to not worry about it.

35:50.800 --> 35:53.400
If he is out of the closet, he will tell you when he's ready.

35:53.400 --> 36:00.200
And if he's not, it is not your place to convince him to come out of the closet.

36:00.200 --> 36:05.800
Maybe maybe you are gay, too, and you want him to be gay so you can be in love together.

36:05.800 --> 36:11.600
And if so, I would submit, you do not understand how these things work.

36:11.600 --> 36:15.160
It does not work like you would think it did when you were four years old.

36:15.160 --> 36:16.320
Trust me on this.

36:16.320 --> 36:22.480
I want to hear Griffin's final question, but first a few quick housekeeping things.

36:22.480 --> 36:28.080
Our website is my brother, my brother and me, it's mbmbam.com.

36:28.080 --> 36:30.200
You can find out how to ask us questions on there.

36:30.200 --> 36:33.160
We love all of your questions.

36:33.160 --> 36:38.280
What we also love is when people on Twitter, you can follow us on Twitter, at mbmbam.

36:38.280 --> 36:45.920
We also love to see people asking questions or saying quotes and using the mbmbam hashtag,

36:45.920 --> 36:53.840
just putting the quotes out there, try to get people interested in the show.

36:53.840 --> 36:57.360
We have t-shirts available.

36:57.360 --> 37:03.960
We are going to try to get some new gear out, some new new merch soon.

37:03.960 --> 37:10.840
Yeah, now is now is the time to start sounding off on whether or not you guys want more shirts

37:10.840 --> 37:12.520
if you didn't get any.

37:12.520 --> 37:18.300
I guess there's still some available, but if we did do more shirts, what would you like

37:18.300 --> 37:19.300
to see?

37:19.300 --> 37:26.140
We've gotten a bunch of people requesting some more Russo's artwork, which is all exceptional

37:26.140 --> 37:29.400
and I would love to put on my body every day of the week.

37:29.400 --> 37:33.880
That's the end game really for this podcast, is to create at least seven different shirts

37:33.880 --> 37:35.440
featuring Justin Russo's artwork.

37:35.440 --> 37:38.440
What you might have seen on Tosh.0.

37:38.440 --> 37:39.640
What you may have seen on Tosh.0.

37:39.640 --> 37:45.600
Just let us know on the Twitter what you guys would like to see or in the Facebook group,

37:45.600 --> 37:48.320
which we have also.

37:48.320 --> 38:00.800
Thanks to obviously to Mr. Dr. Muffin, thanks to people getting the word out, L-E-M-M-E-L-L-I-M-E-M

38:00.800 --> 38:03.480
says he is going to get an M-B-M-B-A-M tattoo.

38:03.480 --> 38:04.480
So if that happens-

38:04.480 --> 38:05.480
Oh, don't do that.

38:05.480 --> 38:06.480
No, do that.

38:06.480 --> 38:08.480
Please, please, please, please don't do that.

38:08.480 --> 38:09.480
What?

38:09.480 --> 38:10.480
Definitely do that.

38:10.480 --> 38:11.480
Do that.

38:11.480 --> 38:12.480
I promise.

38:12.480 --> 38:13.480
That's a two out of three vote.

38:13.480 --> 38:14.480
Two to one.

38:14.480 --> 38:15.480
We are going to get that tattoo.

38:15.480 --> 38:16.480
We are going to get bored.

38:16.480 --> 38:19.440
We are going to get bored with doing this in three weeks and it will never happen again.

38:19.440 --> 38:22.960
People will be like, what's that random string of letters on your forearm mean?

38:22.960 --> 38:23.960
And why is it so big?

38:23.960 --> 38:25.520
Why is it so, so big?

38:25.520 --> 38:26.520
Everyone can see it.

38:26.520 --> 38:27.520
Now let me counterpoint with this.

38:27.520 --> 38:29.280
Get it, pussy.

38:29.280 --> 38:30.880
Thanks to Grifty176.

38:30.880 --> 38:38.640
He wore his M-B-M-B-A-M t-shirt to the Spam Museum, which is magical.

38:38.640 --> 38:43.040
And thank you to everybody who follows us and tells other people to listen.

38:43.040 --> 38:44.800
Get a friend to listen this week.

38:44.800 --> 38:45.800
Make him a CD.

38:45.800 --> 38:46.800
That's your homework.

38:46.800 --> 38:47.800
That's your homework.

38:47.800 --> 38:49.880
Get one friend to listen.

38:49.880 --> 38:56.440
And the same with the past couple of weeks, if you have an M-B-M-B-A-M listening party,

38:56.440 --> 39:01.360
let us know and we'll record an intro for your first meeting so you can welcome everyone.

39:01.360 --> 39:06.540
So just let us know what it's going to be, your email, that kind of thing.

39:06.540 --> 39:11.160
Your first meeting gets a message, your 10th meeting gets a message, your 20th meeting

39:11.160 --> 39:12.160
and so on.

39:12.160 --> 39:13.160
And so on.

39:13.160 --> 39:16.440
And your 100th meeting, you get a special podcast full length.

39:16.440 --> 39:17.440
Yeah.

39:17.440 --> 39:18.440
Yeah.

39:18.440 --> 39:19.440
Yeah, you do.

39:19.440 --> 39:20.440
I think you can promise that.

39:20.440 --> 39:21.440
Oh my god.

39:21.440 --> 39:22.440
If you throw 100 parties.

39:22.440 --> 39:23.440
That'll be like 30 years in the future.

39:23.440 --> 39:24.440
Sure.

39:24.440 --> 39:25.960
Yeah, like 150 years in the future.

39:25.960 --> 39:31.520
But mad shout outs to John Nugent and Jeff Mondlach.

39:31.520 --> 39:38.960
Still the only, now the only official M-B-M-B-A-M fan clubs, we might have another one at the,

39:38.960 --> 39:43.680
I believe it's the Pierhead in Galway, Ireland.

39:43.680 --> 39:46.320
Galway, Ireland.

39:46.320 --> 39:47.320
Can you believe that?

39:47.320 --> 39:48.320
I can't.

39:48.320 --> 39:49.520
That's like a world away.

39:49.520 --> 39:50.520
I refuse to believe that.

39:50.520 --> 39:51.800
That's so crazy to me.

39:51.800 --> 39:57.200
But thanks to James Scott for spreading the word there.

39:57.200 --> 39:58.200
And so that's the show.

39:58.200 --> 40:00.520
Subscribe on iTunes, review some iTunes.

40:00.520 --> 40:02.040
Thank you so much for listening.

40:02.040 --> 40:03.040
Yeah.

40:03.040 --> 40:04.040
And you can follow us on Twitter.

40:04.040 --> 40:07.440
It's just our names, Justin, Travis, Griffin, McElroy.

40:07.440 --> 40:09.680
So Griffin, hit me.

40:09.680 --> 40:13.040
This one was sent in by Cal.

40:13.040 --> 40:23.600
It's a question that is by Yahoo Answers user Raven Face, who needs to know, absolutely

40:23.600 --> 40:29.120
has to know, can a man knock out a gorilla using only hand-to-hand combat?

40:29.120 --> 40:32.600
How am I supposed to break to this?

40:32.600 --> 40:33.600
I'm Justin McElroy.

40:33.600 --> 40:34.600
I'm Travis McElroy.

40:34.600 --> 40:35.600
I'm Griffin McElroy.

40:35.600 --> 40:41.240
If this has been my brother, my brother, me, kiss your dad square on the lips.

40:41.240 --> 40:42.240
You will never know me.

40:42.240 --> 40:43.240
I'm Griffin McElroy.

40:43.240 --> 40:44.240
This has been my brother, my brother, me, kiss your dad square on the lips.

40:44.240 --> 41:08.880

41:16.220 --> 41:17.220
This has been my brother, my brother, me, kiss your dad square on the lips.

You will never know me.

41:18.220 --> 41:19.220
I'm Justin McElroy.

41:19.220 --> 41:20.220
I'm Griffin McElroy.
